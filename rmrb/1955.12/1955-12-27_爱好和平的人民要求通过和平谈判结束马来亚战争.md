    Data: Peace-loving people demand an end to the Malayan War through peaceful negotiations
    According to a statement by the Malayan authorities, the Secretary-General of the Malayan Communist Party, Chen Ping, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, and the Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, will hold talks in the last week of December. The broad masses of the Malayan people and peace-loving people around the world hope that this meeting will lead to a peaceful resolution of the Malayan War.
    The Malayan War is a colonial war launched by the British rulers. For more than seven years, the British authorities have spent hundreds of millions of pounds in war expenses annually, dispatched more than 30,000 British troops, hundreds of thousands of Malayan colonial police forces and foreign mercenaries, and used various cruel methods such as "grouping villages" and "blockades" in an attempt to eliminate the Malayan National Liberation Army. However, the colonialists' plan failed. Former British Colonial Secretary Lyttelton admitted in a speech in March 1954: "We may never have a day of complete victory."
    The colonial war has brought great suffering to the Malayan people. Ending the war, abolishing the "Emergency Regulations", and achieving peace and independence in Malaya have become the unanimous and strong demands of residents of all ethnic groups and strata in Malaya. The current Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, once said: "The Malayan people are tired of this war."
    On May 1, 1955, the headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army issued a statement proactively proposing to end the Malayan War through peaceful negotiations. The statement said: "Our goal is, and only is, a peaceful, democratic, and independent Malaya. Whenever possible, we have always been willing to strive to achieve the above goals peacefully." The statement proposed holding a round table conference to fully discuss issues related to ending the war and peacefully achieving Malayan independence in order to reach a unanimous agreement that conforms to the actual situation in Malaya.
    On June 23, the former government of the Federation of Malaya announced its rejection of the peace proposals of the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army. The British Commander of Operations in Malaya, Bourne, announced that he would insist on "suppressing the rebellion to the end" and unreasonably demanded the "unconditional surrender" of the Malayan National Liberation Army. This practice of the British colonialists was opposed by people of all strata in Malaya, including those from the upper classes. Abdul Aziz Ishak, a leader of the United Malays National Organisation who was then a member of the Federal Legislative Council, said on June 24: "The Malayan Communist Party's proposal should not be rejected hastily," and that the proposal "should be carefully considered."
    On July 27, the Federation of Malaya held its first election of members of the Legislative Council. The MCA-MIC Alliance, led by Rahman, won. Malayan newspapers pointed out that the reason for their victory was that their campaign platform proposed to achieve peace and self-determination in Malaya as soon as possible.
    On September 8, the British Commander of Operations in Malaya, Bourne, and the authorities of the Federation of Malaya issued a so-called "amnesty order" that was tantamount to demanding the unconditional surrender of the Malayan National Liberation Army.
    On September 12, the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party issued a statement pointing out that the "amnesty order" was unreasonable and unrealistic. The statement said: "We advocate seeking a reasonable unanimous agreement through direct negotiations between the warring parties as soon as possible, so as to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire at an early date and satisfactorily resolve various issues related to the abolition of emergency regulations and the peaceful realization of Malayan independence. In order to avoid the continued loss of life and property, and in order to smoothly resolve various political issues in a peaceful atmosphere, it is absolutely necessary for representatives of both sides to reach an agreement on a comprehensive ceasefire first. We believe that as long as the Malayan British military authorities are truly willing, a comprehensive ceasefire can be achieved quickly."
    The peace initiatives repeatedly proposed by the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army have been widely responded to by the Malayan people. Legislative councilors representing different social strata, different races, and different political beliefs, as well as many parties, trade unions, and other social organizations, have criticized the unreasonable attitude of the British authorities and demanded that peaceful negotiations be conducted with the Malayan Communist Party through democratic means and that the legal status of the Malayan Communist Party be recognized.
    Peace-loving people all over the world, the people of Asian and African countries, together with the Malayan people, demand the realization of peace in Malaya.
    The strong pressure of the people demanding peace has promoted the progress of the situation. According to a recent announcement by the Malayan authorities, representatives of the government of the Federation of Malaya have successively contacted Chen Tian, a representative of the Malayan Communist Party, and reached an agreement on the specific arrangements for peace talks between Chen Ping, Secretary-General of the Malayan Communist Party, and Rahman, Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya.
    However, there is still a small group of warmongering colonialists who, disregarding the universal desire of the people to end the war, are deliberately sabotaging the peace talks. After the second contact between the representatives of the two sides on November 18, the British Commander of Operations in Malaya, Bourne, and the authorities of the Federation of Malaya issued a joint statement on November 21 announcing that they would "resume large-scale offensive operations" against the Malayan National Liberation Army.
    In an authorized statement to the Malayan press in November, Chen Tian, a representative of the Malayan Communist Party, said that the broad masses of the people hoped that both sides in the peace talks would adopt a sincere, conciliatory and tolerant attitude towards all issues related to the peace talks. This hope of the people must be realized. The statement said that a very small number of powerful warmongers are unwilling to accept the lesson that guns have not brought peace for eight years, and fantasize about using military pressure and food blockades to force the Liberation Army to surrender. However, today there has emerged in Malaya an unprecedented wave of struggle for independence, democracy, and peace, and this wave is bound to rise higher and higher. Victory will surely belong to the Malayan people who are fighting for independence, democracy, and peace.

### 爱好和平的人民要求通过和平谈判结束马来亚战争

    资料爱好和平的人民要求通过和平谈判结束马来亚战争
    据马来亚当局宣布，马来亚共产党总书记陈平同马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼和新加坡首席部长马歇尔将在十二月最后的一个星期举行会谈。马来亚广大人民和全世界爱好和平的人士都希望这一次会谈能导致马来亚战争的和平解决。
    马来亚战争是英国统治者发动的殖民战争。七年多以来，英国当局每年耗费了成亿镑的战费，先后出动了三万多英国军队、几十万马来亚殖民警察队伍和外籍雇佣兵，并且使用了“并村”、“封锁”等种种残酷手段，企图达到消灭马来亚民族解放军的目的。但是，殖民者的计划失败了。前任英国殖民大臣李特尔顿在一九五四年三月的一次演说中也不得不承认：“我们可能永远没有获得完全胜利的日子。”
    殖民战争给马来亚人民带来了很大的痛苦。结束战争、废除“紧急条例”、实现马来亚的和平和独立，已经变成了马来亚各民族、各阶层居民一致的强烈要求。现任马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼也曾经说：“马来亚人民对这场战争已经厌倦了”。
    一九五五年五月一日，马来亚民族解放军总部发表声明，主动地提出经过和平谈判来结束马来亚的战争的建议。声明说：“我们的奋斗目标是，而且仅仅是，和平、民主、独立的马来亚。只要有可能，我们向来都愿以和平方式争取实现上述目标。”声明倡议举行圆桌会议，对有关结束战争、和平实现马来亚独立等问题进行充分的讨论，以求达成符合马来亚实际情况的一致协议。
    六月二十三日，前马来亚联合邦政府宣布拒绝马来亚共产党和马来亚民族解放军的和平建议。英国驻马来亚作战司令鲍恩宣布坚持“戡乱到底”，并且无理地要求马来亚民族解放军“无条件投降”。英国殖民者的这种作法，遭到了包括上层分子在内的马来亚各阶层人民的反对。当时任联合邦立法议员的马来亚民族联合机构的一位领袖阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·伊沙克在六月二十四日说：“不应当马上匆促地拒绝马来亚共产党的建议”，这个建议“应当予以慎重考虑”。
    七月二十七日，马来亚联合邦举行第一次立法议会议员的选举。以拉赫曼为首的马华印联盟获得胜利。马来亚报纸指出，获胜的原因是它们的竞选纲领中提出了尽速实现马来亚和平和自决的主张。
    九月八日，英国驻马来亚作战司令鲍恩和马来亚联合邦当局发布了等于要求马来亚民族解放军无条件投降的所谓“大赦令”。
    九月十二日，马来亚共产党中央委员会发表声明，指出“大赦令”是不合理的、不现实的。声明说：“我们主张立即通过作战双方的直接谈判，求得合理的一致协议，以便早日实现全面停火并且圆满解决有关撤消紧急条例、和平实现马来亚独立的各项问题。为了避免人命和财产的继续损失，为了在和平气氛中顺利解决各项政治问题，双方代表首先就全面停火问题达成协议是完全必要的，我们相信，只要马来亚英国军事当局真正愿意，全面停火就能迅速实现。”
    马来亚共产党和马来亚民族解放军一再提出的和平倡议，得到了马来亚人民的广泛响应。代表不同社会阶层、不同种族、不同政治信仰的立法议员和许多党派、工会和其他社会团体都指责英国当局的无理态度，要求通过民主的方式同马来亚共产党进行和平谈判并且承认马来亚共产党的合法地位。
    全世界爱好和平的人民，亚非各国人民，同马来亚人民一起，要求实现马来亚和平。
    人民要求和平的强大压力，推动了局势的进展。据马来亚当局最近宣布，马来亚联合邦政府代表已经同马来亚共产党代表陈田先后进行了接触，就马来亚共产党总书记陈平同马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼之间举行和平谈判的具体安排达成了协议。
    但是，现在还有一小撮好战的殖民主义者，不顾人民要求结束战争的普遍愿望，蓄意破坏和平谈判。在十一月十八日双方代表作了第二次的接触以后，英国驻马来亚作战司令鲍恩和马来亚联合邦当局在十一月二十一日发表了一项联合声明，宣布将对马来亚民族解放军“恢复采取大规模的进攻行动”。
    马来亚共产党代表陈田在十一月间向马来亚报界发表的一项受权声明中说，广大人民希望和谈的双方在对待一切有关和谈的问题上采取真诚和解和忍让的态度。人民的这个希望是必须予以实现的。声明说，极少数有权势的好战分子不愿意接受八年来枪炮不能带来和平的教训，幻想采用军事压力和粮食封锁来强迫解放军屈服。但是，今天马来亚已经出现了空前规模的争取独立、民主、和平的斗争浪潮，这个浪潮势必愈来愈高涨。胜利必定是属于争取独立、民主、和平的马来亚人民的。
