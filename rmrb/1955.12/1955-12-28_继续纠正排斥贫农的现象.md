    Continue to Correct the Phenomenon of Excluding Poor Peasants

    In the agricultural cooperation movement, the vast majority of regions across the country, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," first focused on absorbing poor and lower-middle peasants into cooperatives, and initially established the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the leadership organs of the cooperatives. For example, according to statistics from the Lu'an Special District of Anhui, among the 5,594 newly established cooperatives, there were 157,139 poor and lower-middle peasant members, accounting for 89 percent of the total 176,562 households joining the cooperatives. According to statistics from Guoyang County in the same province, among the 17,230 cooperative directors, committee members, and production team leaders, 16,511 were from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, accounting for 95.8 percent of the total.

    When the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, the socialist enthusiasm of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants to join cooperatives was unstoppable. Coupled with the fact that Party organizations at all levels generally paid more attention to implementing the Party's class line during this period, the phenomenon of restricting poor and lower-middle peasants from joining cooperatives has indeed greatly decreased compared to the previous period. But does this mean that discrimination and exclusion against poor and lower-middle peasants is no longer a serious problem? Does it mean that we don't need to continue to do more work in this area? No. This is not only because there are still many instances of excluding poor and lower-middle peasants from joining cooperatives, but also because the current discrimination and exclusion against poor and lower-middle peasants is mainly not manifested in restricting them from joining cooperatives, but in damaging the interests of poor and lower-middle peasant members in many ways. That is to say, after poor and lower-middle peasants join cooperatives, they are politically attacked, economically deducted from, and efforts are made to prevent them from holding a dominant position in the leadership of the cooperatives. There are many tricks to this kind of discrimination and exclusion. In the Dongyan Cooperative of Chefang Township, Wuxian County, Jiangsu, the first-class land of poor peasant member Wang Genquan was deliberately assessed as second-class land, forcing Wang Genquan to withdraw from the cooperative. In the handling of the issue of pricing draft cattle for cooperative entry in the cooperatives of Yuxi Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, the price of draft cattle purchased by poor peasant members with state loans was generally reduced by 10 percent compared to the market price, while the price of draft cattle of middle peasant members was generally increased by about 10 percent compared to the market price.

    Even in the old cooperatives, this kind of discrimination and exclusion against poor and lower-middle peasants is very serious. In a cooperative in Qianying Village, Goubei Township, Shunyi County, Hebei, ostensibly to take care of the members who had no food to eat, a portion of grain was distributed to poor members first. In reality, this cooperative distributed wet corn to poor peasant members and dry corn to middle peasant members, with a difference of 25 jin per 100 jin. In the Zhangjiawu Village Cooperative, Shaziying Township, the same county, when discussing work, because a cadre from a poor peasant background expressed a different opinion from a cadre from a middle peasant background, the cadre from an upper-middle peasant background even said: "Do you have money? If you don't have money, talk less!"

    It should be pointed out that the issue of whether to discriminate against and exclude poor and lower-middle peasants is the central issue in the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads today. Poor and lower-middle peasants, especially after they have grasped the leadership of the cooperatives, must resolutely run the cooperatives well and resolutely lead all the peasants onto the road of happy and prosperous socialism. But many upper-middle peasants are different. Before joining the cooperatives, they wanted to take the capitalist road; after joining the cooperatives, they are still very attached to the capitalist road. In terms of their attitude towards the interests of the state, these two groups of people are also different. Poor and lower-middle peasant members generally are willing to obey the state's unified purchase and sale plan for grain and sell more surplus grain to the state, while many upper-middle peasant members often want to sell as little surplus grain to the state as possible. For example, among the 248 middle peasant-dominated cooperatives in Yidu County, Shandong, 129 cooperatives resisted the implementation of the state's unified purchase and sale policy for grain. In these cooperatives, struggles generally broke out between poor and lower-middle peasant members and upper-middle peasant members. In some cooperatives, the poor and lower-middle peasant members won; in some cooperatives, the erroneous views of the upper-middle peasant members were adopted, and the cadres from upper-middle peasant backgrounds further attacked the poor peasant members and cadres from poor peasant backgrounds. For example, in Beiwu Village, Shunyi County, Hebei, a cooperative director from a poor peasant background was removed from his post at the instigation of cadres from upper-middle peasant backgrounds because he reported the cooperative's actual output to the state. This shows that this struggle is complex.

    The key to solving the problem of discrimination against and exclusion of poor and lower-middle peasants lies in combining party consolidation with cooperative rectification. Many materials prove that the key to the occurrence of discrimination against poor peasants in many cooperatives lies in the Communist Party members. The Communist Party members in these cooperatives not only do not correctly implement the Party's class line in an exemplary manner, but also take the lead in discriminating against and excluding poor and lower-middle peasants. Among these party members, there are two different situations. One type of person has developed capitalist ideas due to the rise in economic status. These people are not interested in how to change the poor living conditions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but are very enthusiastic about the issue of individuals getting rich. When the poor and lower-middle peasants had not joined the cooperatives, these party members joined with the upper-middle peasants to restrict the poor peasants from joining; after the poor and lower-middle peasants joined the cooperatives, these party members again joined with the upper-middle peasants to infringe on the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a mistake of losing class stand. Another type of person excludes the poor and lower-middle peasants because they are deeply influenced by the old society and have a low level of class consciousness. Because in the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants were always exploited and oppressed and never had social status, their talents were limited in development. After liberation, in mass movements such as land reform, it was proved that poor peasants should not only be masters of their own affairs, but they indeed had the talent to be masters of their own affairs. It is a pity that many people's old ideas have not been transformed, and they still look down on poor peasants, thus committing the mistake of harming the interests of poor peasants and even bullying poor peasants. Among these people, there are not only party members from middle peasant backgrounds, but also party members from poor peasant backgrounds. This is a matter of class consciousness. For the former type of person, serious ideological criticism should be carried out, and it should be made clear to them that Communist Party members discriminating against and excluding poor and lower-middle peasants is contrary to the fundamental interests of the Party. The Communist Party of China is the political party of the working class, and the liberation of the working class is the fundamental interest of this political party. For the liberation of the working class, all working people must be liberated. Poor and lower-middle peasants are the most basic and most important part of the working people. Therefore, discrimination against and exclusion of poor and lower-middle peasants is not an ordinary small mistake, but a major mistake related to the loss of class stand. All Communist Party members must correct this serious principled mistake and return to the Party's stand. Otherwise, they cannot be a Communist Party member. For the latter type of person, the main task is to repeatedly conduct education on the class line and make it clear that poor and lower-middle peasants are the basic force in implementing the Party's cooperation policy. Without poor and lower-middle peasants, not only the Party's cooperation policy, but also the Party's other policies cannot be implemented. At the same time, the erroneous argument that poor and lower-middle peasants cannot write, cannot count, cannot speak, cannot do things, and therefore cannot run cooperatives should be criticized. Most poor and lower-middle peasants cannot write or count because the old society deprived them of the right to learn culture. Not being able to write or count is a difficulty for running cooperatives, but it is not an insurmountable difficulty. Many regions are now formulating comprehensive plans to eliminate rural illiteracy in order to solve this problem. As for saying that poor and lower-middle peasants cannot speak, this is not a general fact. Many poor and lower-middle peasants speak very well. Saying that poor and lower-middle peasants cannot do things is especially not a fact. Many poor and lower-middle peasants are very good at doing things; some who originally lacked experience in doing things have quickly learned to do things. In the land reform, poor and lower-middle peasants did a very good job, overthrowing the landlords and distributing the land. In running cooperatives, they also did a very good job. If there is not enough cultivated land, they reclaim wasteland; if there are not enough draught animals, they use human labor instead; if there is not enough funds, they run the cooperatives frugally. This is how they have run many cooperatives well. Who says they have no talent?

    In party consolidation, those party members who discriminate against and exclude poor and lower-middle peasants must be severely criticized, and those party members whose mistakes are serious or refuse to correct their mistakes should also be given appropriate punishments. After discovering the phenomenon of discrimination against poor peasants, the general party branch of Wuli Township, Yexian County, Shandong Province, conducted education on the class line among all party members, seriously criticized the ideas of discriminating against and excluding poor and lower-middle peasants, and at the same time expelled Ju Chunnuan, the general branch committee member and director of the Fifth Cooperative, from the party, and revoked his position as director. In this way, not only was Ju Chunnuan himself educated, but also all party members were educated. The party branch secretary immediately visited poor peasants household by household to help them solve problems in production and life, and ordinary party members also cared about the lives of poor peasants. The poor peasants were in high spirits and determined to become masters of their own affairs and run the cooperative well. After discovering that party member Yuan Guihua had the sentiment of refusing to allow poor peasant Zhou Hanqing to join the cooperative, the party branch of Houluo Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, held individual talks with Yuan Guihua and repeatedly explained the Party's principles and policies for the cooperation movement. However, Yuan Guihua was unwilling to correct his erroneous ideas, using the excuse that refusing Zhou Hanqing to join the cooperative was the opinion of the middle peasants; the branch then convened a general meeting of all party members to expose and criticize Yuan Guihua's erroneous ideas. At this time, Yuan Guihua realized his mistake and expressed his determination to correct his mistake.

    While solving ideological problems, the leadership composition of the cooperatives should also be appropriately adjusted to ensure that poor and lower-middle peasants occupy an absolute advantage. However, at present, a few responsible cadres of grassroots party organizations advocate replacing all cadres from upper-middle peasant backgrounds in the cooperatives after ideological criticism. This is also incorrect. In the leadership organs of the cooperatives, there must be cadres from upper-middle peasant backgrounds who represent the interests of the upper-middle peasants. At the same time, a small number of cadres from upper-middle peasant backgrounds are still doing a good job, are fair and selfless, and are enthusiastic about running the cooperatives; after education on the Party's class line, these people can still hold certain leadership positions. Only those who resolutely discriminate against and exclude poor and lower-middle peasants must be replaced.

    Comprehensively and correctly implementing the class line is a complex and long-term task. It may be implemented well in one thing, and problems may occur in another; it may be implemented well in the entire cooperative and the entire branch, and problems may occur with individual members and individual party members. Therefore, in addition to conducting inspections in conjunction with the annual party and cooperative rectification work, party organizations at all levels should also inspect the implementation of this line in daily work.

### 继续纠正排斥贫农的现象

    继续纠正排斥贫农的现象
    在农业合作化运动中，全国大多数地区按照毛泽东同志指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，首先着重吸收贫农和下中农加入合作社，并且在合作社的领导机关中，初步树立起贫农和下中农的优势。例如，据安徽六安专区统计，在五千五百九十四个新建社中，就有贫农和下中农社员十五万七千一百三十九名，占入社总户数十七万六千五百六十二户的百分之八十九。又据该省涡阳一县统计，在一万七千二百三十个社长、社务委员、生产队长中，贫农和下中农成份的就有一万六千五百一十一名，占总数的百分之九十五点八。
    当农业合作化高潮到来的时候，广大贫农和下中农入社的社会主义积极性是阻挡不了的，加上各级党组织在这一时期大都比较注意贯彻执行党的阶级路线，因而近来限制贫农和下中农入社的现象，比前一时期的确大大减少了。但是这是不是说歧视和排斥贫农、下中农的现象就不成为严重问题了呢？是不是说我们在这方面就不必继续作更多的工作了呢？不是的。这不仅因为排斥贫农和下中农入社的现象还有不少，而且因为目前歧视和排斥贫农、下中农，主要不表现在限制贫农或下中农入社方面，而表现在多方面地损害贫农和下中农社员的利益方面，这就是说，在贫农和下中农入社以后，在政治上打击他们，在经济上克扣他们，想办法不让他们在社的领导上居于优势。这种歧视和排斥的花样很多。江苏吴县车坊乡东堰一社，故意把贫农社员王根泉的一等田评为二等田，逼得王根泉只好退社。四川省资中县鱼溪乡各合作社，在处理耕牛折价入社问题中，对贫农社员用国家贷款伙买的耕牛的价格，一般的都比市价压低百分之十，而对中农社员的耕牛的价格又都比市价提高百分之十左右。
    就是在老社中，这种歧视和排斥贫农和下中农的现象，也有很严重的。河北顺义县沟北乡前营村一个合作社，表面上为了照顾没粮食吃的社员，先分给贫苦社员一部分粮食。实际上，这个合作社是把湿玉米分给了贫农社员，干玉米分给了中农社员，两者每百斤相差就有二十五斤。该县沙子营乡张家务村有个合作社，在讨论工作的时候，因为贫农成份干部发表了和中农成份干部不同的意见，上中农成份的干部甚至说：“你有钱吗？没有钱，少说话！”
    应当指出，是否歧视和排斥贫农和下中农的问题，是今天社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的中心问题。贫农和下中农参加合作社特别是在掌握了合作社的领导权之后，就要坚决把社办好，就要坚决把全体农民引上幸福富裕的社会主义大道。但是许多上中农就不同。他们在入社前，想走资本主义道路；在入社后，对资本主义道路还是十分留恋。在对待国家利益的态度上，这两部分人也是有不同的。贫农和下中农社员一般地愿意服从国家粮食统购统销计划，多卖余粮给国家，而许多上中农社员却往往想尽可能少卖余粮给国家。例如山东益都县的二百四十八个中农占优势的合作社中，就有一百二十九个社抗拒执行国家粮食统购统销政策。在这些社里，贫农、下中农社员和上中农社员之间一般地都展开了斗争。有的社，贫农和下中农社员胜利了；有的社，上中农社员的错误主张被采纳了，而且上中农成份干部还对贫农社员和贫农成份干部进一步地加以打击。例如河北顺义县北务村一个贫农成份的社长，因为向国家报告了合作社的实产量，就被上中农成份的干部鼓动社员撤消了社长职务。这就说明了这种斗争是复杂的。
    解决歧视和排斥贫农、下中农问题的关键，在于结合整社进行整党。许多材料证明：许多合作社中所以发生歧视和排斥贫农的现象，关键就在于共产党员。这些合作社中的共产党员不仅不以身作则地正确地执行党的阶级路线，而且带头歧视和排斥贫农和下中农。在这些党员中，又有两种不同的情形。一种人是因为经济地位上升而滋长了资本主义思想，这些人对怎样改变贫农和下中农的贫苦生活状况的问题不感兴趣，但对个人发家致富的问题，则非常热心。在贫农和下中农没有入社的时候，这些党员和上中农共同地来限制贫农入社；在贫农和下中农入社后，这些党员又和上中农共同地来侵犯贫农和下中农的利益。这是丧失阶级立场的错误。另一种人排斥贫农和下中农，是因为受旧社会影响较深，阶级觉悟不高。因为在旧社会里，贫农和下中农从来是被剥削被压迫的，从来没有社会地位，所以他们的才能的发展受到限制。解放以后，在土地改革等群众运动中，证明了贫苦农民不只是应该当家作主，而且确实有当家作主的才干。可惜有很多人的旧观念还没有转变过来，还是看不起贫苦农民，因而犯了损害贫农利益甚至欺压贫农的错误。这些人中不仅有中农成份的党员，而且有贫农成份的党员，这是阶级觉悟的问题。对前一种人，要进行严肃的思想批判，对他们说清楚：共产党员歧视和排斥贫农和下中农，是同党的根本利益相违背的。中国共产党是工人阶级的政党，解放工人阶级是这个政党的根本利益。为了工人阶级的解放，就必须解放一切劳动人民。贫农和下中农正是劳动人民中最基本的一部分，也是最主要的一部分。因此，歧视和排斥贫农和下中农，就不是普通的小错误，而是关系到丧失阶级立场的大错误。一切共产党员，必须改正这种严重的原则性的错误，回到党的立场上来。否则，就不能做一个共产党员。对后一种人，主要是反复地进行阶级路线的教育，说清楚贫农和下中农是贯彻执行党的合作化政策的基本力量，离开贫农和下中农，不仅党的合作化政策，就是党的其他各项政策，也无法贯彻执行。同时，要批判所谓贫农和下中农不会写算，不会说话，不会做事，因而不会办社的错误论调。贫农和下中农中大多数人不会写算，这是因为旧社会剥夺了贫农和下中农学习文化的权利。不会写算，这对办社是一个困难，但也不是不可克服的困难。现在许多地区都正制定扫除农村文盲的全面规划，就是为了解决这个问题。至于说贫农和下中农不会说话，这不是一般的事实。很多贫农和下中农说得很好。说贫农和下中农不会做事，这尤其不是事实。很多贫农和下中农很会做事；有些原来缺少做事的经验的，也很快学会了做事。土地改革中，贫农和下中农做事就做得很好，斗倒了地主，分配了土地。在办社中，他们做事也做得很好。耕地不足，开荒；耕畜不足，用人力代替；资金不足，勤俭办社。他们就这样办好了不少合作社。谁说他们没有才干呢？
    在整党中，对于那些歧视和排斥贫农和下中农的党员，必须要严肃的批判，对那种错误严重或者拒绝改正错误的党员，还要给以适当的处分。山东掖县五里乡党总支在发现歧视和排斥贫农的现象后，就在全体党员中进行阶级路线的教育，对歧视和排斥贫农和下中农的思想进行严肃的批判，同时把坚持这方面错误的总支委员、第五社社长鞠春暖开除出党，并撤消了社长职务。这样，不仅教育了鞠春暖本人，而且教育了全体党员。党的分支部书记立即挨户访问贫农，帮助贫农解决生产和生活中的问题，一般党员也都关心贫农的生活。贫农情绪很高涨，决心当起家来，把社办好。湖南湘潭县厚罗乡党支部在发现党员袁桂华有拒绝贫农周汉清入社的情绪以后，就同袁桂华进行个别谈话，反复解释党对于合作化运动的方针和政策。但是，袁桂华不愿纠正自己的错误思想，借口说拒绝周汉清入社是中农的意见；支部就召开全体党员大会，对袁桂华的错误思想进行了揭发和批判。这时候，袁桂华才觉悟过来，表示决心改正自己的错误。
    在解决思想问题的同时，还应该适当地调整社的领导成份，保证贫农和下中农占绝对的优势。但是现在有少数党的基层组织的负责干部，在经过思想批判之后，主张把合作社中的上中农成份的干部一律撤换。这也是不对的，在社的领导机关中，必须有代表上中农利益的上中农成份干部。同时，有少部分上中农成份干部的工作还是很好的，公正无私，热心办社；经过党的阶级路线教育之后，这些人仍可以担任一定的领导工作。只有那些坚决歧视和排斥贫农、下中农的才必须撤换。
    全面地正确地贯彻执行阶级路线，是个复杂的长期的工作，在这件事情上执行得很好，在那件事情上又可能发生问题；在整个社整个支部中执行得很好，在个别社员个别党员身上又可能发生问题。因此，各级党组织除了要结合每年的整社整党工作进行检查外，还要在日常工作中检查这一路线执行的情况。
