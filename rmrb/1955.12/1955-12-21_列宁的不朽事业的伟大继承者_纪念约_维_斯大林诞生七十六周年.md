    The Great Successor of Lenin's Immortal Cause
    -- Commemorating the 76th Anniversary of the Birth of J.V. Stalin
    A. Zubalev, Candidate of Historical Sciences, Soviet Union
    December 21st is the 76th anniversary of the birth of J.V. Stalin, Lenin's faithful student and closest comrade-in-arms, the great successor of Lenin's immortal cause.

    Stalin's name is infinitely precious to the Communist Party and the Soviet people, to the revolutionary proletariat and laborers of all countries in the world. He rightfully stands alongside the names of the greatest thinkers and revolutionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries—Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The brilliance of their invincible ideas illuminates the path of social development, illuminates the revolutionary struggle of millions of working masses against capitalism and for the victory of communism.

    Stalin's life and activities are closely linked with the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the heroic struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the interests of the laborers and for the happiness of the people.

    Stalin came from the people. He always felt the flesh-and-blood connection between himself and the people, the working class and the working peasants. He dedicated all his powerful strength and wise intelligence to the people. In his youth, after studying Marxism-Leninism, Stalin understood the historical mission of the working class as an advanced fighter for the freedom and happiness of the people, and deeply realized that in modern conditions, the laboring people can only find the road to a free and happy life on the road of struggle for communism. This determined his path in life. He dedicated himself entirely to the selfless struggle for the cause of the working class and the cause of the laboring people. Stalin deeply believed in the people, in the people's powerful creativity, and in the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and peasants, and relied on the support of the laboring masses in all his activities.

    Stalin participated in the revolutionary movement during a historical period when Lenin launched a relentless struggle against the open and hidden enemies of Marxism, against various manifestations of opportunism in the workers' movement, striving to organize and unite the forces of the proletariat under the banner of Marxism, and striving to establish a new Marxist revolutionary party of the working class in Russia that was fundamentally different from the reformist parties of the Second International.

    After learning about Lenin's revolutionary activities and studying his brilliant works, Stalin regarded him as a faithful successor to the revolutionary doctrines of Marx and Engels, a true creator, leader, and mentor of the revolutionary party, the highest exemplar of a leader, a "mountain eagle who knows no fear in struggle and boldly leads our party forward along the newly opened road of the Russian revolutionary movement." Stalin was filled with boundless trust in Lenin's revolutionary genius and resolutely advanced along his path, tirelessly helping Lenin in the work of building a new type of party, and resolutely and uncompromisingly defended Lenin's ideas. Stalin fought alongside Lenin and under his leadership to overthrow the Tsarist autocracy, landlords and capitalists, and to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. He was Lenin's faithful and worthy student. Stalin said in a conversation with the German writer Ludwig: "As for me, I am just a student of Lenin, and the purpose of my life is to be worthy of being his student."

    After embarking on the difficult path of a professional revolutionary, Stalin was constantly subjected to the harsh persecution of the Tsarist authorities for fifteen years—seven imprisonments and six heavy exiles filled with unbelievable hardships. But like other revolutionaries educated by Lenin, Stalin escaped from exile several times and participated in active revolutionary activities again, mobilizing the worker masses to engage in the political struggle against the Tsarist autocracy. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, Stalin experienced the glorious path of a propagandist of Marxist-Leninist ideas, an organizer of strikes and political demonstrations, and a builder of party organizations and trade unions. He possessed the richest experience in conducting political and organizational work among the masses. After the Prague Party Conference (1912), which laid the foundation for the final formation of the Bolsheviks into an independent party, Stalin was elected to the Central Committee of the Party, and from then until his death, he remained a member of the Central Committee.

    After the Russian bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, Stalin returned to Petrograd (now Leningrad) from his last and most arduous exile, the Turukhansk exile. Together with Lenin and under Lenin's leadership, he devoted all his energy to the struggle to overthrow the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat, and establish Soviet power. Under the entrustment and leadership of the Party, Stalin made great organizational contributions to the preparation and conduct of the armed uprising in Petrograd.

    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Stalin was Lenin's closest assistant in solving the complex tasks of establishing and consolidating the Soviet state and building socialism. As People's Commissar for Nationalities Affairs, he participated in the first Soviet government led by Lenin. Stalin devoted great energy to correctly solving one of the most complex and difficult problems in political life—the national question.

    During the period of the Civil War and foreign armed intervention, Stalin was Lenin's closest assistant in building and politically educating the Red Army, organizing national defense, crushing domestic counter-revolutionary forces, and driving foreign invaders out of the borders of the Soviet state. J.V. Stalin, who was authorized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to lead the Soviet armed forces and the Defense Committee at that time, played an outstanding role in defeating the enemy and winning the historic victory of the Soviet people. In the post-war years, the Soviet people made unprecedented efforts to heal the wounds brought about by the war in a short period of time, restore the country's national economy, and raise all sectors of the economy, technology, science, and culture to a new and higher stage.

    Now, the Soviet Union, filled with indestructible power and creative strength, is confidently advancing along the road of gradual transition from socialism to communism.

    For the benefit of the Soviet people and the laborers of the world, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, the principles of which were formulated by the genius Lenin and resolutely implemented in life by Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause. Stalin stubbornly and tirelessly defended the cause of peace and ruthlessly exposed the instigators of war. The Soviet state's peaceful foreign policy is based on Lenin's principle that two different systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—can coexist in peaceful competition. The entire Soviet people, loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, believe that it is their sacred duty to resolutely defend and consolidate the greatest achievements of the people of all countries—the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, to consolidate the eternal brotherly friendship with the great Chinese people, with the working people of the European and Asian people's democratic countries, and with all peace-loving countries.

    Following the instructions of the founders of Marxism-Leninism, Stalin called on Marxists-Leninists to study the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism in depth. He himself always combined all his daily activities among the masses, his intensive state work, and the Party's political work with in-depth study and creative exploration of Marxist-Leninist theory. Stalin consistently maintained the purity of revolutionary theory. In the fierce struggle against the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, against the enemies of the Party and the people, he not only defended the Party's intellectual wealth, but also developed it in accordance with the new historical conditions, enriching revolutionary theory with many new important principles. In his theoretical works, Stalin revealed the invaluable treasure of Leninism, the Communist Party, and this greatest asset of advanced science.

    Starting from Lenin's organizational principles, Stalin believed that the iron unity and rock-solid solidarity of the Party's ranks are the main conditions for the consolidation and strength of the Communist Party. He tirelessly fought for the unity of the Party's ranks and the strengthening of its combat effectiveness. Faced with the new historical tasks of communist construction, the Party is further consolidating the unity of its ranks and strengthening its combat effectiveness, and striving to promote inner-Party democracy. It strictly adheres to the norms of Party life established by Lenin and the long-tested Leninist principles of collective leadership. Relying on the scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist theory, relying on the creative enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, the collective experience and collective wisdom of the Central Committee of the Party ensure the correctness of the leadership of the Party and the state.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, armed with the ideas of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of its Central Committee, is confidently leading the Soviet state forward along the road of building communism.

    列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者
    ——纪念约·维·斯大林诞生七十六周年
    苏联历史学候补博士  阿·祖巴列夫
    十二月二十一日是列宁的忠实学生和最亲密的战友、列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林诞生的七十六周年。
    斯大林的名字对于共产党和苏联人民，对于世界各国的革命无产阶级和劳动者，都是无限珍贵的。它当之无愧地同十九世纪和二十世纪最伟大的思想家和革命家——马克思、恩格斯、列宁的名字并列在一起。他们的战无不胜的思想的光辉照耀着社会发展的道路，照耀着千百万劳动群众反对资本主义、争取共产主义胜利的革命的斗争道路。
    斯大林的生活和活动同苏联共产党的历史，同苏联共产党为劳动者的利益、为人民的幸福而进行的英勇斗争紧密地联系在一起。
    斯大林是从人民中来的。他时时都感到自己同人民、同工人阶级和劳动农民的血肉般的联系。他把自己全部的强大的力量和明哲的智慧都献给了人民。斯大林还在青年时代的时候，经过对马克思列宁主义的研究，便了解到作为争取人民的自由和幸福的先进战士的工人阶级的历史使命，并深刻地认识到，在现代的条件下，劳动人民只有在为共产主义而斗争的道路上才能找到通往自由和幸福生活的大路。这就决定了他的生活道路。他完全献身于为工人阶级的事业、为劳动人民的事业而从事的忘我斗争。斯大林深信人民、深信人民的强大的创造力和工人、农民的无限革命热情，并在自己的全部活动中依靠着劳动群众的支持。
    斯大林参加革命运动正是在这样一个历史时期，当时列宁展开了无情的斗争来反对马克思主义的公开的和暗藏的敌人，反对机会主义在工人运动中的各种表现，争取把无产阶级的力量组织和团结在马克思主义的旗帜下，争取在俄国建立工人阶级的新的、同第二国际改良主义的政党有着原则性区别的马克思主义的革命政党。
    斯大林在了解到列宁的革命活动并研究了他的天才著作后，便把他看作是马克思和恩格斯的革命学说的忠实继承者，是革命政党的真正缔造者、领袖和导师，是最高典型的领导者，是一个“在斗争中不知恐惧为何事，而大胆引导我们党沿着俄国革命运动新辟道路向前迈进”的山鹰。斯大林对列宁的革命天才充满了无限信任并坚决地沿着他的道路前进，始终不倦地帮助列宁从事建立新型政党的工作，坚决地和毫不调和地捍卫列宁的思想。斯大林同列宁一道并在他的领导下为推翻沙皇专制制度、地主和资本家，为建立无产阶级专政而斗争。他是列宁的忠实的和当之无愧的学生。斯大林在同德国作家路得维希的谈话中说道：“至于我呢，却不过是列宁的学生，而我一生的目的，就是要不愧作他的学生。”
    斯大林在踏上了职业革命家的艰难道路以后，曾在长达十五年期间不断受到沙皇当局的严酷迫害——七次监禁、六次沉重的、充满了难以置信的艰苦的流放。但是正像列宁教育下的其他革命家一样，斯大林曾几次从流放中逃走并且又参加了积极的革命活动，动员工人群众从事反对沙皇专制政体的政治斗争。在以列宁为首的布尔什维克党的领导下，斯大林经历了马克思列宁主义思想的宣传家、罢工和政治示威的组织者、党组织和工会的建设者的光荣道路，他具有在群众中进行政治工作和组织工作的最丰富的经验。在奠定了使布尔什维克最后形成独立政党的基础的布拉格党代表会议（一九一二年）之后，斯大林被选进了党的中央委员会，从那时起直到他逝世时为止，始终是中央委员会的委员。
    在一九一七年二月俄国资产阶级民主革命之后，斯大林从最后的、也是最艰苦的一次流放，从土鲁汉斯克流放地回到彼得格勒（现在的列宁格勒）。他和列宁一起并在列宁的领导下把自己的全部精力献给为推翻资产阶级专政、取得无产阶级专政、建立苏维埃政权的斗争。在党的委托和领导下，斯大林曾在准备和进行彼得堡的武装起义方面作了巨大的组织工作。
    伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以后，在解决建立和巩固苏维埃国家、建设社会主义这些复杂任务中，斯大林是列宁的最亲近的助手。他以民族事务人民委员的资格参加了列宁领导的第一届苏维埃政府。斯大林曾用很大的精力来正确地解决了政治生活中一个最复杂和困难的问题——民族问题。
    当国内战争和外国武装干涉时期，在建立红军并给以政治教育、组织国防、粉碎国内反革命势力、把外国侵略者赶出苏维埃国家国境时，斯大林是列宁的最亲密的助手。
    在国内战争胜利结束并打退了国际资本对社会主义国家的第一次进攻以后，工人阶级和劳动农民在共产党的领导下开始从事和平的经济建设。党的领袖，无产阶级革命的天才战略家列宁制定了把经济上落后的俄国变成一个先进的强大的社会主义国家的有科学根据的计划。
    斯大林非常积极地参加了党的组织工作，参加了为在苏维埃国家建成社会主义的斗争。
    从国内战争向和平的社会主义建设的过渡是伴随有国内残酷的阶级斗争和党内斗争的。列宁逝世后，斗争特别尖锐化起来。党和苏联人民的敌人——作为国际帝国主义代理人的托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子和资产阶级民族主义者，竭力想使党不相信社会主义能在苏联获得胜利，它们想使党离开列宁的道路，为恢复资本主义创造条件。共产党在以斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，粉碎了叛徒和投降分子，捍卫了列宁的学说，巩固了自己队伍的团结一致，并更加紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围，勇敢地领导了苏联人民沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。
    在最初几个五年计划的年代中，共产党不倦地巩固着工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，巩固着苏联各族人民的友谊，胜利地实现了自己的国家工业化和农业集体化的政策，引导了苏维埃国家的劳动人民走向社会主义的历史性胜利。
    在苏联对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本进行伟大卫国战争的年代里，苏联人民在共产党的鼓舞和领导下，克服了艰巨的困难，以自己在前线和后方的英雄功绩捍卫了社会主义的成果、自己的自由和独立，并把欧洲和亚洲人民从法西斯奴役下拯救出来。当时由共产党中央委员会和苏联政府授权领导苏联武装力量和国防委员会的约·维·斯大林，在击溃敌人和争得苏联人民的历史性胜利的事业中起了杰出的作用。苏联人民在战后年代里作出了空前的努力，以便在短期内医好战争带来的创伤，恢复国家的国民经济，并把经济、技术、科学和文化的一切部门提高到新的更高的阶段。
    现在，充满了不可摧毁的威力和创造性力量的苏联，正满怀信心地沿着从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的道路前进。
    为了苏联人民和全世界劳动者的利益，共产党和苏联政府一贯实行着爱好和平的对外政策，这种对外政策的原则是由天才的列宁制定并由列宁事业的继承者斯大林坚决贯彻到生活中的。斯大林顽强地、不倦地捍卫了和平事业，无情地揭破了战争挑拨者。苏维埃国家的爱好和平的对外政策是以列宁关于两种不同的制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度——能够在和平竞赛中共处的原理为根据的。共产党和苏联政府领导下的忠于无产阶级国际主义旗帜的全体苏联人民认为，坚决地保卫并巩固各国人民的最伟大的成果——强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，巩固同伟大的中国人民、同欧洲和亚洲各人民民主国家的劳动人民以及同所有爱好和平的国家的永恒的兄弟友谊关系，是自己神圣的义务。
    斯大林遵循着马克思列宁主义创始人的指示，号召马克思列宁主义者深入研究马克思列宁主义的革命理论。他本人始终是把自己所有在群众中的日常活动、紧张的国家工作和党的政治工作，同深入钻研和创造性地探讨马克思列宁主义理论结合起来。斯大林一贯地维护革命理论的纯洁性。在同马克思列宁主义的敌人、同党和人民的敌人进行的激烈斗争中，他不仅捍卫了党的思想财富，并且按照新的历史条件发展了它，以许多新的重要原理丰富了革命理论。斯大林在自己的理论著作中揭示了列宁主义、共产党和先进科学的这个最伟大财产的无价的宝藏。
    斯大林从列宁主义的组织原则出发，认为党的队伍的钢铁般的统一和磐石般的团结是共产党巩固和强大的主要条件。他不倦地为党的队伍的统一和加强它的战斗力而奋斗。在面临着共产主义建设的新的历史任务时，党在更加巩固着自己队伍的统一和加强它的战斗力，竭力发扬党内民主。它严格地遵守着列宁制定的党的生活的准则和久经考验的列宁的集体领导原则。依靠着马克思列宁主义理论的科学原理、依靠着人民群众的创造热情和首创精神的党中央委员会的集体经验和集体智慧，保证对党和国家领导的正确性。
    由马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的思想武装起来的苏联共产党，在自己的中央委员会的领导下，满怀信心地引导着苏维埃国家沿着建设共产主义的道路前进。
