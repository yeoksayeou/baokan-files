    Strive for Early Commencement of Construction Projects
    Wang Pu
    The key projects undertaken by the First Mining Construction Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, according to the current general practice, would require at least three months of preparation after the construction drawings arrive before construction can begin. However, due to the close cooperation between Party A and Party B and the design department, and the commencement of construction preparation work before the construction drawings arrived, the project officially commenced one month after the construction drawings arrived.
    Good construction preparation is an important condition for ensuring the smooth progress of construction. This is recognized by many. However, how to prepare for construction in the shortest possible time so that the project can commence early has not been given sufficient attention by all capital construction units and construction and installation enterprises. Some leaders of capital construction units and construction and installation enterprises, on the one hand, emphasize that "construction conditions are not available" and should not rush to start construction; on the other hand, they do not actively and proactively start construction preparation to strive for early commencement. As a result, the commencement date is repeatedly delayed, and the country's construction investment cannot quickly produce results. The First Mining Construction Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company and other units are not like this. In order to strive for early commencement, Party A, Party B, and the design department support each other in construction preparation and actively help each other overcome difficulties. For example, the measurement of the main axis of the construction site and the removal of obstacles to construction should be the responsibility of Party A according to regulations, but Party B took the initiative to support Party A when it saw that Party A's strength was insufficient; when Party B temporarily found that it lacked eight hundred meters of cast iron pipe when renovating the original underground pipeline, Party A took the initiative to lend it to Party B. Due to mutual support, many preparation tasks were completed in advance.
    Some people believe that it is difficult to start construction preparation work before the construction drawings arrive. The experience of the First Mining Construction Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company proves that some preparation work can be carried out completely before the construction drawings arrive. For example, they learned about the construction site and became familiar with the construction plan from the study of technical design documents, and with the help of relevant units, they measured the construction site, built some temporary projects, removed construction obstacles, and built transportation roads, thus greatly reducing the preparation work after the construction drawings arrived and winning early commencement.
    Of course, it is much more difficult to carry out construction preparation work based on technical design documents than based on construction drawings. However, the experience of the First Mining Construction Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company and other units tells us that difficulties can be overcome. For example, without a general layout plan, they measured the dimensions from the technical design and then enlarged them on site, thus overcoming the difficulty of not having coordinates. For another example, if the location of some projects is unknown whether it will change in the future, they contacted the design unit through relevant departments, and as a result, they also received a definite reply before the construction drawings arrived. The key here is whether the construction unit and the design unit have the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties. Without this spirit, even if there are construction drawings as a basis, difficulties cannot be resolved quickly, and the commencement date will still be delayed. Since the technical design documents are correct, the construction preparation work based on them should also be reliable. The fact that the key projects undertaken by the First Mining Construction Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company have been constructed smoothly after commencement is the most powerful proof.
    Strengthening collaboration, giving play to the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties, doing as much construction preparation work as possible in advance, and commencing as many projects as possible in advance play a great role in accelerating the speed of socialist industrialization.

    争取建设工程早日开工
    王朴
    鞍山钢铁建设公司第一矿山工程公司所承担的重点工程，按照现在一般的做法，至少在施工图纸到达以后再准备三个月才能开工，但是，由于甲、乙双方和设计部门的密切配合，以及在施工图纸没有到达以前就着手进行施工准备工作，在施工图纸到达的一个月就正式开工了。
    做好施工准备，是保证施工顺利进行的一个重要条件。这是许多人都已认识到的。但是，对怎样用最短的时间做好施工准备，使工程提前开工，没有为所有基本建设单位和建筑安装企业所重视。有些基本建设单位和建筑安装企业的领导人员，一方面强调“施工条件不具备”，不能匆促开工；另一方面又不积极地主动地着手施工准备，争取尽早开工。结果是开工日期一再被拖延，国家的建设投资不能迅速地发生效果。鞍山钢铁建设公司第一矿山工程公司等单位则不是这样，为了争取提早开工，甲、乙双方和设计部门，在施工准备工作中互相支援，主动帮助对方克服困难。如测量施工现场的主轴线和清除施工的障碍物，按规定应该由甲方负责，但是乙方看到甲方力量不足，便主动支援甲方；乙方在改建原有地下管道的时候，临时发现缺少八百公尺铸铁管，甲方就主动借给乙方。由于互相支援，许多准备工作都得以提前完成。
    有人认为在施工图纸没到达以前很难着手进行施工准备工作，鞍山钢铁建设公司第一矿山工程公司的经验证明，有些准备工作完全可以在施工图纸到达以前进行。例如他们从对技术设计文件的研究中，了解了施工现场和熟悉了施工方案，并且在有关单位的帮助下，测量了施工场地，修建了部分临时工程，清除了施工障碍物，修建了运输道路，因而大大减少了施工图纸到达以后的准备工作，赢得早日开工。
    当然，根据技术设计文件进行施工准备工作会比根据施工图纸来进行要困难得多。但是，鞍山钢铁建设公司第一矿山工程公司等单位的经验告诉我们，困难是可以克服的。例如，没有总平面图，他们就从技术设计上把尺寸量下来，再拿到现场去放大，就克服了没有座标的困难。又如有的工程位置不知将来会不会变动，他们就通过有关部门跟设计单位联系，结果也在施工图纸没有到达以前就得到了肯定的答复。这里问题的关键在于施工单位、设计单位是否有主动克服困难的精神。没有这种精神，即使有施工图纸作依据，遇到困难也不能迅速解决，开工日期还是被拖延。技术设计文件既然是正确的，根据它来进行的施工准备工作也应当是靠得住的。鞍山钢铁建设公司第一矿山工程公司所承担的重点工程开工以后顺利施工的事实，就是最有力的证明。
    加强协作，发挥主动克服困难的精神，把可以提前进行的施工准备工作尽可能提前做好，把可以提前开工的工程尽可能提前开工，对于加快社会主义工业化的速度有很大的作用。
