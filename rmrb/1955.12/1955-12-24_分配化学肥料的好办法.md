In order to adapt to the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, supply and marketing cooperatives in Ningbo Special District, Zhejiang Province, are rationally allocating the chemical fertilizer they plan to supply next year.

The principle for allocating chemical fertilizer this time is: to focus on meeting the needs of fertilizer application for cash crops and staple grains (rice), and to appropriately consider the needs of high-yield miscellaneous grains. In order to continue to support farmers in changing their farming systems, a supply method has also been determined whereby continuous cropping rice receives more fertilizer than intercropping rice, and intercropping rice receives more than single-season rice. The allocation ratio is generally slightly more for agricultural production cooperatives than for mutual aid teams, and slightly more for mutual aid teams than for individual farmers. The allocation method is determined through democratic consultation, and then farmers propose a purchase time, and fertilizer purchase certificates are issued in advance.

Through the pre-allocation of chemical fertilizer, supply and marketing cooperatives can avoid the passive and unreasonable phenomena of chemical fertilizer supply work in the past. Farmers are also very satisfied with this approach. They said: With fertilizer allocated in advance, we have a sense of security. In Shaojia Township, Yinxian County, there were originally only nine boats dredging river mud. Later, farmers knew that the chemical fertilizer they could buy next year would not meet the needs of production, so the number of mud dredging boats increased to thirty-nine.

In the current situation where commercial fertilizer cannot be supplied to meet the needs of agricultural production in large quantities, it is a good method to be promoted by supply and marketing cooperatives to drive the vast number of farmers to accumulate fertilizer through distribution and supply operations.

    分配化学肥料的好办法
    为了适应农业合作化运动的发展，浙江省宁波专区各县供销合作社对明年计划供应的化学肥料正在进行合理分配。
    这次化学肥料的分配原则是：以满足技术作物和主粮（水稻）的施肥为主，并且适当照顾高产杂粮的需要。为了继续支持农民改变耕作制度，还确定了连作稻多于间作稻，间作稻多于单季稻的供应办法。分配的比例一般是农业生产合作社稍多于互助组，互助组稍多于单干农民。分配办法是经过民主协商确定，然后由农民提出购买时间，预先发给购肥证。
    通过预先分配化学肥料，供销社可以避免过去化学肥料供应工作被动和不尽合理的现象。农民对这种作法也很满意。他们说：预先分配了肥料，心里有了底。鄞县邵家乡原来只有九只船罱河泥，后来，农民知道明年能够买到的化学肥料不能满足生产上的需要，罱泥船就增加到三十九只。
    在当前商品肥料还不能大量供应农业生产需要的情况下，供销社通过分配、供应业务带动广大农民积肥是一个值得提倡的好办法。
