Where is the Hatoyama Government Headed?
	Zhuang Tao

The second Hatoyama government in postwar Japan, which came to power in March after the sixth postwar general election in Japan in February this year, announced its general resignation on the 21st of this month. On the 22nd, the Japanese Diet convened an extraordinary session and re-elected Ichiro Hatoyama as Prime Minister. That afternoon, the third Hatoyama government in postwar Japan was proclaimed. This new Hatoyama cabinet is composed of twelve former Democrats and seven former Liberals after the merger of the two conservative parties in Japan.

The merger of Japan's conservative parties and the subsequent establishment of the third Hatoyama government in Japan took place in the context of a political crisis in Japan. The movement for the merger of Japan's conservative parties has been brewing for a long time and has gone through a tortuous path. When Japan held its fifth postwar general election in April 1953, the Liberal Party's seats in the House of Representatives fell from 240 in the fourth general election in October 1952 to 199, failing to obtain a majority of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives at that time. After the seats of the left and right wing Socialist Parties, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Communist Party increased from 115 in the fourth general election to 144, a small number of pro-American factions within the Japanese conservative forces actively demanded the merger of the Japanese conservative parties, attempting to resist the growth of Japan's peaceful and democratic forces. When the Yoshida government in Japan was teetering in April 1954, they felt even more the need to unify the Liberal and Progressive parties to cope with the crisis. Therefore, on April 13th last year, they issued a statement in the name of the Liberal Party, calling for the dissolution of the Liberal and Progressive parties and the formation of a new party, and carried out activities for this purpose. However, this activity ultimately failed in June last year due to differences of opinion within the Japanese conservative forces. After the failure of the new party movement of the Japanese conservative forces, Yoshida went abroad for a tour in September last year in an attempt to save his own crisis, but returned empty-handed. During this period, the Japanese conservative forces, led by Hatoyama, continued to organize a new party, named the Democratic Party.

The new party movement of the Japanese conservative forces developed into a movement to overthrow the Yoshida government in the winter of last year. The most important reason for this was that the Japanese conservative forces, with the exception of a small number of pro-American factions, were not willing to endure American control for a long time. Especially when the Japanese economy, which relied on American military orders, suffered a serious increase in difficulties with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953, the contradictions between Japan and the United States further developed. The Japanese people and the broad patriotic forces increasingly demanded that the Japanese authorities implement policies that conformed to the interests of the Japanese nation. The growth of anti-American sentiment among the Japanese people could not but affect the development of contradictions within the Japanese ruling class. More and more people within the Japanese conservative forces expressed dissatisfaction and opposition to the policy of complete submission to the United States pursued by the Yoshida government at that time. They demanded to get rid of American control, restore and develop Japan's normal foreign trade, and restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union in order to open up trade relations with China and the Soviet Union. Finally, the Yoshida cabinet finally collapsed under the opposition and pressure of the broad patriotic forces in Japan and was met with dissatisfaction within the conservative forces. The Japanese Democratic Party, led by Hatoyama, put forward slogans such as "independence and autonomy" and "restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union," and won more seats and came to power for the first time in December last year.

The above series of facts, from the proposal to the failure of the merger of the Japanese conservative parties, and from the failure to the movement to overthrow the Yoshida government, vividly illustrates the profound crisis brought to itself by the Yoshida government's policy of submitting to the United States and implementing policies that violated the interests of the Japanese people and the nation, so that it finally had to announce its collapse. The unpopularity of the Japanese Liberal Party was even more obvious in the general election in February this year. After this election, the Liberal Party's seats in the House of Representatives fell from 199 in the previous session to 112, while the seats of the left and right wing Socialist Parties, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Communist Party increased from 144 in the previous session to 162. These facts were originally a serious lesson for the Hatoyama government, which officially came to power after the election, but the facts of the second Hatoyama government's eight months in power have proved that the Hatoyama government has not absorbed these lessons well, thus making itself fall into crisis.

In the past eight months, the second Hatoyama government has not effectively fulfilled its promises to the voters. In terms of Japan's foreign relations, although the Hatoyama government began negotiations with the Soviet Union in London in June this year on the conclusion of a treaty, which was a step forward compared with the Yoshida government, no agreement has been reached so far, and the Hatoyama government, under the pressure of the United States and the coercion of a small number of pro-American factions in the country, has made various unreasonable demands on the Soviet Union. On Sino-Japanese relations, compared with the Yoshida government, the Hatoyama government has indeed relaxed the flow of personnel between China and Japan to a certain extent, but it has been idling on restoring normal relations between China and Japan. In terms of Japan's domestic policy, since Shigemitsu visited Washington in August this year and held talks with the US authorities, the Hatoyama government has accelerated the pace of rearming Japan. The Hatoyama government also advocates revising the Constitution to clear the way for rearming Japan.

These policies pursued by the Hatoyama government are not in line with the Japanese people's desire for independence, peace, and democracy, and have increasingly aroused greater dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. The Japanese people's movement for national independence, peace, and democracy has had new developments. Anti-Americanism has become a common sentiment among the Japanese people. In this situation, the left and right wing Socialist Parties of Japan, which had been split for four years, announced their merger on October 13th this year. As a result, the Socialist Party has 154 seats in the House of Representatives, becoming the second largest party after the Democratic Party's 184 seats. The program of the merged Socialist Party puts forward the proposition of realizing independence and restoring normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, which reflects the demands of the Japanese people in this regard. These constitute a serious threat to the policies currently pursued by the Hatoyama government. At the same time, the Japanese Democratic Party, led by Hatoyama, although it jumped to become the largest party in the Japanese general election in February this year and came to power, it did not reach the statutory number of more than half of the total 467 seats in the House of Representatives, and was in the position of a minority party. Any proposal of the government could not be established without the support of other opposition parties. Therefore, the Hatoyama government itself had to be in extreme turmoil.

The United States is most uneasy about the current situation in Japan. According to a report from the United Press International in Washington on the 14th of this month, "The anti-American attitude taken by the Socialists, especially in recent weeks, has made it very clear to Washington officials that the merger of the Conservative Party is the only solution that the West can accept." Therefore, from the US-Japan talks at the end of August this year to the visit of US Deputy Secretary of State Hoover to Japan in early October this year, pressure has been exerted on the merger of the two conservative parties in Japan. The US authorities attempt to consolidate a majority of 299 seats in the House of Representatives through the merger of the two conservative parties in Japan, control the Diet, stabilize the political situation, and impose various reactionary measures on the people, thereby achieving its goal of hindering Japan's approach to China and the Soviet Union and resisting the growth of Japan's peaceful and democratic forces.

It can be seen from this that the merger of the Japanese conservative parties and the establishment of the third Hatoyama government are actually a method adopted by the Japanese ruling class to cope with the political crisis it faces. The question now is, where will the newly established Hatoyama government go? Can Japan's political situation really be stabilized in the future?

Judging from Hatoyama's speech after the formation of the new government on the 22nd and the vague program issued by the current ruling Liberal Democratic Party before and after its formation, the new Hatoyama government is ambiguous and contradictory in its foreign and domestic policies. The Liberal Democratic Party proposed to "actively develop peaceful diplomacy" in its program, but in its foreign policy, it did not mention a word about Sino-Japanese relations, which are closely watched by the Japanese people, attempting to evade this issue. On the issue of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the Liberal Democratic Party put forward unreasonable demands such as immediately releasing Japanese war criminals, sending back Japanese nationals, and unconditionally returning Habomai, Shikotan, and the South Kuril Islands. However, Hatoyama said in his speech on Soviet-Japanese negotiations on the 22nd: "We cannot indefinitely fail to resolve the issue of ending the state of war between the two countries. Unless diplomatic relations between the two countries are normalized, we probably cannot get back the un-repatriated Japanese." In terms of domestic policy, the policy guidelines issued by the Liberal Democratic Party and Hatoyama's speech both emphasized the need to revise the Constitution, which implies expanding Japan's armed forces. But at the same time, they both issued checks, stating that they would revise the tax system so that the people could afford it, stabilize the currency value, and balance international payments to stabilize people's lives.

Under the pressure of the United States and the influence of a small number of pro-American factions in Japan, there are obviously still differences and contradictions within the new Hatoyama government on the issue of where to go. This is also a partial reflection of the struggle between two roads in Japan. Today in Japan, there is in fact a struggle between two roads. One road is the road to strive for independence, peace, and democracy. This is to get rid of American control, restore normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, achieve an independent and autonomous position, prevent the revival of militarism, and make due contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. The other road is the road that the Yoshida government has taken. This is to willingly be an appendage of the United States, obstruct the restoration of normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, revive Japanese militarism, and increasingly fall into the quagmire of the US's aggressive policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," selling out the interests of the Japanese nation, and endangering peace in Asia and the world. The former road is what the Japanese people demand and is supported by a considerable number of enlightened people within the Japanese conservative forces; the latter road is what a small number of pro-American factions in Japan advocate and implement. The history of the past ten years since the war proves that whether Japan's political situation can be stabilized ultimately depends on whether the policies implemented by the Japanese authorities conform to the requirements of the Japanese people and the Japanese nation, and not on the temporary majority in the Diet. The Japanese government that takes the latter road has no possibility of not ultimately suffering a fate of failure. The Hatoyama government came to power by relying on slogans such as "independence, autonomy" and "restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union" that meet the requirements of the Japanese people. The United States hopes to reverse the situation to a completely opposite direction through the merger of the conservative parties. If people really believe that they can do whatever they want by relying on a temporary majority in the Diet, history will prove that they are making a big mistake.

    鸠山政府往何处去？
    庄涛
    经过今年二月日本战后第六次大选而于三月登台的日本战后第二次鸠山政府，已于本月二十一日宣布总辞职。二十二日，日本国会召开临时会议，继续选举鸠山一郎为首相。当日下午，日本战后第三次鸠山政府宣告组成。这次新的鸠山内阁，是在日本两个保守党合并后，由前民主党十二人和前自由党七人共同组成的。
    日本保守政党的合并和随之而来的日本第三次鸠山政府的建立，是在日本政局面临危机的情况下进行的。日本保守政党的合并运动，酝酿已久，曾经历了一段曲折的道路。当一九五三年四月日本举行战后第五次大选时，自由党在众议院的议席，由一九五二年十月第四次大选时的二百四十席降至一百九十九席，未能获得当时众议院总席位四百六十六席的半数，而左右两派社会党、劳农党、共产党的议席，则由第四次大选时的一百十五席增至一百四十四席以后，日本保守势力内部的少数亲美派，便积极地要求日本保守政党合并，企图借此抗拒日本和平民主力量的增长。到一九五四年四月，日本吉田政府摇摇欲坠的时候，他们更感有统一自由、改进两党以应付危局的必要。因此去年四月十三日，他们以自由党的名义发表声明，号召解散自由、改进两党，另组新党，并为此进行活动。但这一活动终因日本保守势力内部的意见分歧而于去年六月宣告失败。日本保守势力的新党运动失败以后，吉田为了挽救本身的危机，曾于去年九月出国外游，结果空手而回。在这期间，以鸠山为首的日本保守势力，继续组织新党，定名为民主党。
    日本保守势力的新党运动在去年冬天发展成为推翻吉田政府的运动，最主要的原因是日本保守势力内部，除了少数亲美派以外，并不是甘愿长期忍受美国的控制的。特别是在依靠美国军事订货的日本经济，随着一九五三年七月朝鲜停战协定的签订而困难严重增加的时候，日美的矛盾有了进一步的发展。日本人民及广泛的爱国力量，日益要求日本当局执行符合于日本民族利益的政策。日本人民反美情绪的增长，不能不影响到日本统治阶级内部矛盾的发展。日本保守势力内部越来越多的人，对当时吉田政府执行的完全屈从美国的政策，表示了不满和反对。他们要求摆脱美国的控制，恢复和发展日本的正常对外贸易，恢复和中国、苏联的邦交，以打开和中苏的贸易关系。最后吉田内阁终于在日本广大爱国势力的反对和压力之下并遭到保守势力内部的不满而垮台了。以鸠山为首的日本民主党，则提出“独立自主”、“恢复日中、日苏邦交”等等口号，取得了较多的席位而于去年十二月第一次上台执政。
    上述日本保守政党的合并问题由提出到失败，由失败到转化为推翻吉田政府的运动的一连串事实，生动地说明吉田政府屈从美国、执行违背日本人民和民族利益的政策而给本身带来的深刻的危机，以至最后不得不宣告垮台。日本自由党的不得人心，在今年二月大选中表现得更明显。经过这次选举，自由党在众议院的议席，由上届的一百九十九席降至一百十二席，而左右两派社会党、劳农党、共产党的议席，则由上届的一百四十四席增至一百六十二席。这些事实，对于选举后正式上台的鸠山政府本来都是严重的教训，但是第二次鸠山政府执政八个月来的事实证明，鸠山政府并没有很好地吸取这些教训，因而使本身也陷入危机中。
    八个月来，第二次鸠山政府并没有切实履行对选民的诺言。在日本的对外关系方面，虽然鸠山政府从今年六月起，在伦敦和苏联开始了关于签订和约的谈判，比吉田政府前进了一步，但谈判至今未获协议，鸠山政府在美国的压力和国内少数亲美派的挟持下，向苏联提出各种无理要求。在中日关系上，与吉田政府比较，鸠山政府固然在某种程度上放宽了中日间人员的来往，但对恢复中日两国的正常关系，实行怠工。在日本的对内政策方面，自从今年八月重光赴华盛顿和美国当局举行日美谈判以来，鸠山政府加速了重新武装日本的步伐。鸠山政府并主张修改宪法，为重新武装日本廓清道路。
    鸠山政府执行的这些政策，是不符合日本人民要求独立、和平、民主的愿望的，日益引起了日本人民的更大不满。日本人民要求民族独立、和平、民主的运动有了新的发展。反美已成为日本人民的普遍情绪。在这种情况下，分裂了四年的日本左右两派社会党，在今年十月十三日宣布合并。结果使社会党在众议院拥有一百五十四席，成为仅次于民主党一百八十四席的第二大党。合并后的社会党的纲领，提出了实现独立及和中苏恢复正常关系的主张，在这方面反映了日本人民的要求。这些对于鸠山政府目前执行的政策，构成了严重的威胁。同时，以鸠山为首的日本民主党，虽然在今年二月日本大选中一跃而为第一大党而上台执政，但它在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，没有达到过半数的法定数目，处于少数党的地位，政府的任何提案，没有其他在野党的支持，都是不能成立的。因此，不得不使鸠山政府本身处在极端动摇之中。
    对日本目前这一局势最感不安的是美国。据合众社华盛顿本月十四日电，“社会党人所采取的反美态度，特别是近几周来，已使华盛顿的官员们很清楚地看出：保守党的合并是使西方可以接受的唯一解决办法。”所以从今年八月末的日美会谈，以至今年十月初美国副国务卿胡佛访问日本，都对日本两个保守政党的合并施加压力。美国当局企图通过日本两个保守政党合并，使之在众议院凑得二百九十九席的多数议席，把持国会、稳定政局，把各种反动措施强加于人民，借此达到其阻碍日本和中苏接近，抗拒日本和平民主力量增长的目的。
    由此可见，此次日本保守政党的合并和第三次鸠山政府的成立，实际上就是日本统治阶级为应付它所面临的政治危机而采取的一种办法。现在的问题在于新成立的鸠山政府究竟将往何处去？今后日本的政局果真能获得稳定吗？
    从鸠山在二十二日新政府组成后发表的谈话，和目前的执政党自由民主党在组成前后发表的含糊的纲领来看，新的鸠山政府在对外、对内政策上是暧昧的、矛盾的。自由民主党在它的纲领中提出要“积极展开和平外交”，但在它的外交方针中，对于为日本人民所密切注视的中日关系，却只字未提，企图回避这一问题。在苏日谈判问题上，自由民主党提出要立刻释放日本战犯，送回日侨及无条件归还齿舞、色丹、南千岛等无理要求。但鸠山在二十二日就苏日谈判发表的谈话中又说：“我们不能无限期地不解决结束两国战争状态的问题，除非两国的外交关系正常了，否则我们大概不可能要回没有遣返的日本人。”在对内政策上，自由民主党发表的政策方针和鸠山的谈话，都强调要修改宪法，即暗示要扩充日本的武装力量。但同时又都开出支票，表示要修改税制，使人民能够负担，要稳定币值和平衡国际收支，以安定人民生活。
    在美国的压力和日本少数亲美派的影响之下，新的鸠山政府内部，在走往何处去的问题上，显然还存在着分歧和矛盾。这也就是两条道路在日本斗争的部分的反映。今天在日本，事实上存在着两条道路的斗争。一条道路是争取独立和平、民主的道路。这就是摆脱美国的控制，恢复日苏和日中的正常关系，取得独立自主的地位，防止军国主义的复活，在维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中作出应有的贡献的道路。另一条道路是吉田政府走过的道路。这就是甘心作美国的附庸，阻挠恢复日苏和日中的正常关系，复活日本军国主义，日益陷入美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略政策的泥坑、出卖日本民族利益、危害亚洲和世界和平的道路。前一条道路是日本人民所要求的，并获得日本保守势力内部相当一部分有识之士的拥护和支持；后一条道路则是日本少数亲美派所主张和执行的。战后十年来的历史证明，日本政局的能否稳定，最后决定于日本当局执行的政策，是否符合日本人民和日本民族的要求，而不决定于国会内的一时的多数。走后一条道路的日本政府，没有可能不最后遭受失败的命运。鸠山政府是凭借“独立、自主”“恢复日中日苏邦交”等符合日本人民要求的口号上台的，美国希望通过保守党的合并把局势扭转到完全相反的方向去，假使人们真的相信凭借国会内一时的多数，就能为所欲为，历史将会证明他们是在大错特错。
