Guiding Peasants on How to Spend Money
　　
Angang

Some say that peasants need guidance in developing production and running cooperatives, but does spending money also require guidance? The answer should be yes. The Party must guide peasants on how to spend their money, using it rationally on production and life, and correctly combining long-term and immediate interests. ×××

This year, the country has had a bumper harvest of cotton and grain, and agricultural cooperatives have generally increased production. The state has invested a large amount of funds to purchase cotton and surplus grain, and the peasants have a lot of money in their hands.

From the increased income, peasants further recognize the superiority of cooperatives and their socialist enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly enhanced. The situation of Gongjiawan Agricultural Cooperative in Nangong County, Hebei Province, can illustrate this. This cooperative has increased production year after year. This year, the average yield of cotton per mu was 223 jin, which is double the unit area yield in 1953. The best harvest of farmers outside the cooperative was only 130 jin. The reason for the increased production is due to the increase in labor and the strengthening of technical management brought about by being organized. The cooperative used 13 to 20 workdays per mu of cotton field (30 workdays for high-yield mu), while farmers outside the cooperative could only use up to 8. Now, 80.67 percent of the total farmers in Nangong County have joined the cooperative. Nangong has a population of less than 300,000. This year, the county harvested 70 million jin of seed cotton, equivalent to 210 million jin of rice; grain crops harvested 80 million jin; peanut income converted to 10 million jin of rice, totaling 300 million jin of grain; the average income per person is 1,000 jin of grain. The increase in farmers' income and the soaring emotions are very good phenomena.

We sing praises of this prosperous scene, which is the victory of the Party's policy. The bumper harvest is built on the basis of cooperativization, which has made the old rural appearance disappear forever. However, from the perspective of leadership, we should also keenly pay attention to every newly emerging problem. How to correctly guide peasants to spend money is one of countless new problems.

In cotton-producing areas, people often talk about various issues related to spending money.

Some cooperatives, because of the increased income and generous finances, want to build theaters, offices, and clubs. Several districts in Xingtai have built theaters. Secretary of the Yanjiatun District Committee said: In the busiest season of production, three cadres came to him asking to build a theater, but the district committee did not approve it.

Many peasants buy bicycles. A grassroots cooperative in Xingtai transported 48 bicycles, and they were sold out in one day. Bicycles in Wei County are already out of stock. Many people go to big cities to buy "imported goods." A peasant household in Wei County, with six brothers, bought six bicycles.

The business of selling furniture is very prosperous. Now, Nangong, Wei County, Handan and other counties are continuously transporting furniture from Tianjin, Jinan and other cities, including tables, chairs, benches, boxes, cabinets, and various antique rosewood appliances.

In terms of daily consumer goods, high-grade biscuits, flashlights, batteries, and flannel trousers are out of stock. Meat consumption has increased compared to previous years. Last year, the county federation of supply and marketing cooperatives in Baixiang County, with a population of 90,000, slaughtered 30 cattle during the Mid-Autumn Festival; this year, 70 cattle were slaughtered, but it was still not enough to sell. There are two public canteens in Nangong City, and people line up every day to wait for meals; many peasants ride bicycles to the canteen to eat. The wine business is also picking up. Baixiang County sold 7,000 jin during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year.

The business situation of this year's temple fairs is also better than in previous years. A large temple fair in Baixiang sold 30,000 yuan worth of rain boots alone. In another temple fair, the supply and marketing cooperative sold 120,000 yuan, and private merchants also sold a lot.

This situation generally occurs in areas where the cooperative movement has made new progress, which is understandable. The vast number of peasants have relatively ample money in their hands, and they want to buy some things they have wanted to buy for a long time and improve their living standards. The situation in areas with more old cooperatives is different. The members bought what they should buy last year. More importantly, they have gradually improved their collectivist ideology in the process of common labor. Their thinking is like this: "Buying a bicycle is convenient for oneself; but if there are not enough livestock in the cooperative, we should give priority to buying livestock; livestock can increase production, which is convenient for everyone." Hei'nao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe County is an advanced cooperative where land is not distributed as dividends. The farmers have a lot of income. Not to mention grain and cotton, the hawthorns alone can be sold for 1,500 yuan this year, and the increase in sheep can yield 800 yuan. Everyone uses a small part of the money to improve their lives, and most of the money to expand production, paying attention to arranging today's life on the one hand, and laying the foundation for a better life next year on the other hand. They have many sheep, an average of 17 per household, and an average of 4 and a half per person; but this year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, all the members only slaughtered one. Their lives have improved rapidly. Before 1948, farmers could not live without bran and vegetables, and wore ragged clothes; now they eat grain and every family has new cloth clothes. They are not satisfied with the existing living standards. They use the method of constantly expanding production to gradually improve their living standards.

Wherever the spontaneous forces of capitalism have a greater impact on the countryside, the peasants there spend money with more blindness. Historically, landlords and rich peasants always used bumper harvests to fleece the peasants. Nangong, a nationally famous cotton-producing area, also had bumper harvests before liberation. But bumper harvests brought disasters to the peasants. According to the old peasants in Nangong, bumper harvests in the past only enriched the landlords. The bumper harvest in 1932, for example, led to the development of a large number of landlord-merchants and commercial capitalists. After liberation, the situation has changed. However, in the year of the bumper harvest in 1952, when rural cooperativization had not yet developed and spontaneous forces were still rising, a collective investment of 800,000 jin of wheat could not stop the speculation of grain merchants. Now the situation has completely changed. A solid socialist position has been established in the countryside. For the first time, peasants have truly broken free from the attack of capitalism. So far, the Nangong People's Bank and credit cooperatives have accepted 2 million yuan in farmers' savings. This is closely related to the fact that more than 80 percent of Nangong farmers have joined cooperatives. From this, we can conclude that it is a good phenomenon that peasants have money to spend and their living standards have improved. Our purpose is to build socialism and continuously improve people's lives. The task of leaders should be to strengthen political work, instill the spirit of socialism in peasants, oppose capitalist tendencies, and specifically help peasants spend their money rationally so that these labor funds can better serve the long-term interests of the country and the peasants.

So, how to guide peasants to spend money?

We oppose drift and also oppose excessive interference. Drift means giving up leadership, which will damage the enthusiasm of the people. A peasant heard people say that bicycles are good every day, so he bought one, but regretted it in less than three days. He can't ride a bike, and he doesn't have time to ride it. He can't use it for carrying manure or sowing seeds; after the cooperative was established, everyone has to "earn work points," and no one has the leisure to ride it to the city to go to the market. Now this bicycle is still locked in the small house. For such peasants, the correct approach is not to stop him from buying a car, but to explain the reason to him before he buys a car, so that he can calmly consider whether it is necessary to buy this year; in this way, even if he does not listen to the advice and still buys it, when he regrets it, he will deeply understand the Party's education and will not be emotional and affect production. It is obviously too much for six brothers to buy six cars. It can be suggested to them: buy two less cars and use the money in more useful places. This is a comrade's advice, not an order, but this in itself is specific leadership. The method of not guiding but restricting peasants' spending is inappropriate. Some cooperatives concentrate too much construction funds and distribute too little to the members, which is not appropriate. Cooperatives should accumulate necessary construction funds, which is for socialism. Similarly, giving the peasants who join the cooperative more remuneration than when they were working individually is also for socialism. Only in this way can the people's enthusiasm for production be maximized and the cooperative can be truly consolidated and strengthened.

More importantly, we should see the essential aspects of things, meet the requirements of the peasants who join the cooperative, and guide them in spending money. The peasants have a great enthusiasm for production investment. This poses new questions for county and district leaders: how to meet the peasants' requirements from the perspective of production? Many county committees are calculating accounts to answer the peasants' questions. Baixiang started earlier and has now bought 60 diesel engines (for pumping water), one for each of the 60 cooperatives; 80 mules and horses were bought back from the Northeast and have now been mostly sold to the cooperatives; they plan to buy another 200 mules and 800 double-wheel double-share plows. Wei County is also preparing to use the 2 million yuan invested by the peasants for water conservancy facilities. This year, the cooperative has developed greatly, pushing all work forward. The peasants demanded to prepare things for next year's production as soon as possible. The cooperatives in Yanjiatun District, Xingtai, have bought 480,000 jin of fine fertilizer, and each cooperative has applied to buy another 2 million jin. There is a shortage of fine fertilizer in the market, and peasants are looking everywhere to find out where to buy it.

The problem now is that all aspects should keep up and adapt to this requirement of the peasants.

The peasants have money and want to dig wells, buy portable steam engines and diesel engines, but the market supply is insufficient. Last month, some peasants complained: "There is not a single water pump in Xingtai City, and the one diesel engine is broken." Digging wells is what peasants are most interested in. But there are too few technicians to meet the needs.

The peasants have money and demand to buy some high-quality daily necessities. Some commercial workers believe that "peasants like cheap things" and transport some unsalable goods to the countryside; these goods are ignored in many places. In areas where the cooperative movement developed later, peasants bought a large number of flannel clothes (such as Wei County). However, in some areas in Xingtai and Shahe with old cooperatives, there is a phenomenon of "weak sales during the peak season" because the variety and quality of the goods do not meet the needs of the masses. Song Zhi, a labor model from Zhang Village in Shahe, is an old man in his fifties, and he is wearing a purple-red flannel suit, saying: "Flannel clothes are good, but the color is wrong." Of course, he will not buy flannel clothes again this year until new and suitable varieties are put on the market.

The peasants' lives have improved, and they further demand to improve their culture. In areas where cooperatives have been established, the number of school-age children enrolled in school is large, and the learning is fixed, and there are few requests for leave. The peasants regard cultivating their children as a major event. Many village schools in Shahe use gas lamps. According to the director of Zhang Village School, gas lamps do not cost more than small kerosene lamps, and peasants are willing to use good lamps to remove the "illiteracy" hat.

The conclusion is that it is a great thing that peasants have money. The Party organization should strengthen political work, guide peasants to spend money, and all work should meet the requirements of the peasants and be ahead of the curve.

    指导农民花钱
    安岗
    有人说，农民发展生产，办合作社，都需要指导，难道花钱还要指导吗？回答应当是肯定的。党要指导农民花钱，把钱合理地用在生产和生活上面，作到长远利益和眼前利益的正确结合。×××
    今年全国棉粮丰收，农业合作社更是普遍增产。国家投放大批资金收购棉花和余粮，农民手里有了大量的钱。
    农民从增加的大量收入中进一步认识到合作社的优越性，社会主义积极性空前提高。河北省南宫县巩家湾农业合作社的情况可以说明一班。这个社年年增产，今年每亩棉花平均收二百二十三斤，单位面积产量比一九五三年提高一倍。而社外农民收成最好的只有一百三十斤。增产原因是由于组织起来用工增多，技术管理加强。合作社在每亩棉田上用十三个到二十个工（丰产亩用三十个工），社外农民最多只能用八个。南宫现在已有占全县总农户百分之八十点六七的农户加入合作社。南宫人口不足三十万，今年全县收七千万斤籽棉，合米二亿一千万斤；粮食作物收八千万斤；花生收入折米一千万斤，共合三亿斤粮食；平均每人收入一千斤粮食。农民收入增加，情绪高涨万分，这是非常好的现象。
    我们歌颂这种富裕的景象，这是党的政策的胜利。丰收是建筑在合作化的基础上的，它使旧的农村面貌一去不复返了。但是，从领导观点来看，我们还应当锐敏地注视着每一个新发生的问题。如何正确地指导农民花钱，这就是无数新问题中的一个。
    在产棉区，人们经常谈论着各种花钱的问题。
    有的合作社因为收入增加了，手头大方起来，想盖戏园，盖办公室，盖俱乐部。邢台有好几区都盖了戏园。晏家屯区委书记谈：南大树村在生产最忙的季节，有三个干部找他要求盖戏园，区委没有批准。
    很多农民买自行车。邢台一个基层社运到四十八辆车，一天卖光了。威县自行车已经脱销。很多人到大城市去买“进口货”。威县有一户农民，弟兄六人，就买了六辆。
    卖家具的生意十分兴隆。现在南宫、威县、邯郸等县每天络绎不绝地从天津、济南等城市运来家具，其中有桌椅板凳，箱子柜子，还有各种古色古香的楠木器具。
    日常消费品方面，上等饼干、电筒、电池、绒裤都有脱销现象。肉的消费量比往年增加。柏乡全县九万人口，去年中秋节县联社杀了三十头牛；今年杀了七十头还不够卖。南宫城里有两个公共食堂，每天有人排成长队等着吃饭；许多农民骑着自行车到食堂吃饭。酒的生意也有起色，柏乡县今年中秋节就销了七千斤。
    今年庙会营业情况也比往年好。柏乡一个大庙会光雨鞋就卖了三万元。另有一个庙会，供销社卖了十二万元，私商卖的也不少。
    这种情况一般都发生在合作化运动有新发展的地区，这是可以理解的。广大农民手头上有了比较宽裕的钱，要置办一些自己长久想买的东西，要提高自己的生活水平。老社多的地区的情况却有不同。社员们该买的东西早在去年就买了。更重要的是他们在共同劳动过程中逐渐提高了集体主义思想，他们的想法是这样：“买辆自行车是自己方便；可是社内牲口不够，就要尽先去买牲口；牲口可以增产，大家方便。”沙河县黑瑙村农业生产合作社是一个土地不分红的高级社。农民收入很多。粮棉不必说了，今年光酸枣就可以卖一千五百元，羊子增产可得八百元。大家用小部分钱提高生活，大部分钱扩大生产，一方面注意安排今天的生活，一方面为明年更美好的生活打基础。他们的羊是很多的，平均每一户有十七只，每个人平均有四只半；但今年过中秋节时，全体社员只杀了一只。他们的生活改善得是快的，一九四八年以前，农民吃饭离不了糠和菜，穿的是破烂衣；现在吃的是粮食，家家都有新布衣。他们没有满足于现有的生活水平，他们用不断扩大生产的办法来逐步提高自己的生活水平。
    凡是资本主义自发势力影响较大的农村，那里的农民花钱就带有较多的盲目性。从历史上看，地主富农总是利用丰收来向农民大开刀。像南宫这样全国有名的产棉区，解放前也曾有过丰收。可是丰收带给农民的却是灾难。据南宫的老农民谈，过去丰收只肥了地主。像一九三二年的丰收，就发展了大批的经营地主和商业资本家。解放以后，情况发生了变化。可是，就在一九五二年丰收的年头，当时农村合作化还没有发展，自发势力还在抬头；一个集投入八十万斤麦子，都挡不住粮食商人的投机捣把。现在情况完全变了。农村建立了牢固的社会主义阵地。农民第一次真正摆脱了资本主义的进攻。到目前为止，南宫人民银行和信用社接受的农民储蓄已有二百万元。这同南宫农民百分之八十以上参加合作社大有关系。由此，我们可以得出结论说：农民有了钱花，生活水平提高了，这是好现象。我们的目的就是为了建设社会主义，不断地提高人民的生活。领导者的任务应当是加强政治工作，向农民灌输社会主义的精神，反对资本主义的倾向；具体帮助农民把钱花得合理，使农民这些劳动资金能更好地为国家和农民的长远利益服务。
    那末，怎样指导农民花钱呢？
    我们反对自流，同时也反对过多的干涉。自流就是放弃领导，这会损害人民的积极性。有一个农民，天天听人说自行车好，于是就去买了一辆，但不到三天就后悔了。他不会骑车，也没有时间骑，担粪、点种都用不上它；成立合作社以后，大家都要“赚劳动工分”，谁也没有闲心骑它去上城赶集，现在这辆车子还锁在小屋里。对于这样的农民，正确的作法不是阻止他去买车，而是在他买车以前给他讲清道理，让他冷静考虑今年有没有必要买；这样，即使他不听劝告，还是买了，在后悔的时候，就会深刻地领会到党的教育，不致闹情绪影响生产。弟兄六个买六辆车显然是多了一些，可以向他们建议：少买两辆，把钱用在更有用的地方。这是同志的忠告，不是命令，但这本身正是具体的领导。那种对农民花钱不是指导而是限制的办法是不妥当的。有的合作社集中建设资金过多，分给社员的太少，这并不合适。合作社要积累必要的建设资金，这是为了社会主义。同样地，分给入社农民较单干时候要多的报酬，这也是为了社会主义。只有这样，才能最大地刺激人民的生产积极性，真正巩固和壮大合作社。
    更重要的是我们应该看到事物的本质方面，满足入社农民的要求，指导他们花钱。农民们生产投资的劲头很大。这就给县区领导人员提出了新的问题：怎样从生产上满足农民的要求呢？很多县的县委会都在盘算一笔账来回答农民的问题。柏乡下手较早，现在已经买到六十架柴油机（抽水用），有六十个社每社一架；从东北买回八十头骡马，现已大部卖给合作社；他们准备再买二百头骡子，八百部双轮双铧犁。威县也准备把农民投资的二百万元用到水利设施上面。今年合作社大发展，把一切工作都向前推进一步。农民要求早一点置办明年生产用的东西，邢台晏家屯区各个合作社已经买到四十八万斤细肥，各社纷纷申请再买二百万斤。市场上细肥供应不足，农民到处打听何处可以买到。
    现在的问题是：各方面都应当跟上去，适应农民这一要求。
    农民有了钱，要打汲井，买锅驼机和柴油机，可是市场供应不足。上月，有些农民抱怨说：“邢台市没有一架抽水机，有一架柴油机还是坏的”。汲井是农民最感兴趣的东西。可是技术工人太少，满足不了需要。
    农民有了钱，要求买进一些品质优良的日用品。有些商业工作同志却认为：“农民喜欢贱东西”，就把一些冷残背次的商品运到农村；很多地方这些商品无人过问。合作化运动发展较晚地区，农民大量购进绒衣（如威县）。可是在邢台、沙河一些有老合作社的地区，却有“旺季不旺”的现象，原因是商品的品种和质量赶不上群众的要求，沙河章村劳动模范宋芝是个五十多岁的老人了，他身上穿的是一身紫红色的绒衣，说：“绒衣是好，就是颜色不对”。当然，今年，在没有新的合适的品种投入市场之前，他是不会再买绒衣了。
    农民生活改善了，进一步要求提高文化。凡是办了合作社的地区，学龄儿童入学人数多，学习也固定，请假的很少，农民把培养子弟看作一件大事。沙河不少村庄的民校点的是汽灯。据章村民校主任说，汽灯不比小煤油灯费钱，农民愿意用好灯摘“文盲”的帽子。
    结论就是一个：农民有了钱是再好也不过的事，党的组织要加强政治工作，指导农民花钱，一切工作都要适合农民的要求，都要走在前面。
