    Rationally Evaluating the Yield of High-Yielding Fields
    When Donglian Township in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, was evaluating the yield of land being pooled into cooperatives, they discovered a problem: according to policy regulations, the yield of land being pooled should be based on the quality of the land, and also on the land's normal, actual yield. However, the normal, actual yield of some land was high only because of the application of fast-acting commercial fertilizers, and the yield would not be so high if those commercial fertilizers were no longer applied in such quantities. How should the yield of such land be evaluated?
    They agreed on the following methods: 1. For land where production increased due to the application of a lot of commercial fertilizer, but the fertility has been exhausted, the yield will not be evaluated based on the actual yield, but will still be evaluated based on the yield of land of the same soil quality; 2. For land where commercial fertilizer has been applied and the fertility has not been exhausted, or where the soil quality has changed to some extent, but the increased production effect can only be maintained for one or two years, only one or two years of consideration will be given, and after one or two years it will still be changed to the yield of land of the same quality; 3. Land that has undergone deep plowing and careful cultivation to change the soil quality will have its yield evaluated according to the changed soil quality.
    Evaluating production according to these methods can not only take care of the interests of farmers who engage in more processing and apply more fertilizer, but also prevent farmers whose yields were lower before joining the cooperative due to lack of labor and capital from being at a disadvantage for a long time.

    合理地评定高产田的产量
    广东省增城县东联乡在评定入社土地产量的时候，发现了一个问题：按照政策规定，评定入社土地产量应当根据土地质量，同时根据土地的常年实际产量；可是，有些土地的常年实际产量虽高，却只是施了速效的商品肥料的结果，如果不再施那么多商品肥料，产量就不会那么高。对这样的土地该怎么评产呢？
    他们议定了这样的办法：一、因为施商品肥料多而增产，但是肥力已经用尽的，不根据实产量评产，仍然按同样土质的土地评产；二、施了商品肥料肥力没有用尽的，或者土质有了一定的改变，但是增产效果只能保持一两年的，只作一两年的照顾，过了一两年之后仍改为同样质量的土地的产量；三、经过深耕细作改变了土质的，按改变后的土质评产。
    按照这样的办法评产，既可以照顾到多加工多施肥的农户的利益，也不至于使入社前因缺乏劳动力和资金而产量较低的农户长期吃亏。
