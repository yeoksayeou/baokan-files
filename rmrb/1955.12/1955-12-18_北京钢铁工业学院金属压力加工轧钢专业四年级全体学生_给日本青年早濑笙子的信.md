To the Editor: Please forward this to Hayase Shoko and peace-loving Japanese youth friends.
Hayase Shoko and beloved Japanese youth friends,

    We read your enthusiastic letter in the People's Daily. We would like to introduce you and your Japanese youth friends to the life of Chinese students.

    We are all fourth-year students majoring in metal pressure processing and steel rolling at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology. Our school buildings were newly built in 1952, and a seven-story building was added this summer. The school has spacious and bright classrooms, well-equipped laboratories of various kinds, and a modern mechanical training factory. In short, the country has created all possible conditions conducive to learning for us!

    In our country, going to university is tuition-free. Students with financial difficulties can also enjoy the "People's Scholarship," which means they don't have to pay for meals every month and can also receive living expenses, and they can also receive cotton-padded clothes in winter. Therefore, we all study without any worries. Our learning is closely linked to practice. In the lower grades, we do experiments in the school's laboratories and internships in the training factory. In the upper grades, we go to factories outside the school to participate in "production internships" and learn practical knowledge from the veteran workers. We also organize various scientific research groups to conduct various meaningful scientific research under the guidance of teachers.

    Our learning has a great goal, which is to build our motherland from an economically backward agricultural country into a prosperous, strong, and industrialized country. Encouraged by this great goal, each of us gives full play to our talents and creativity in our studies. At present, our country is carrying out socialist construction in a vigorous manner, and we college students will soon become useful talents in the country's construction after leaving school.

    Our life is also rich and colorful. The students have organized singing teams, dance teams, bands, poetry recitation groups, track and field teams, gymnastics teams, etc. Every Saturday evening, we hold movie nights, dances, or music appreciation meetings, and sometimes we also perform wonderful programs rehearsed by the students themselves. We enjoy ourselves to the fullest and spend every weekend happily!

    In our country, college students also enjoy public medical care. If students get sick, the state provides free treatment; students with weak bodies can also receive nutritional subsidies. Only in a country where the people are the masters can young people receive such kind care! We can't help but recall the miserable life in old China. At that time, the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the aggression and plunder of the imperialists filled our country with famine and disaster. The American imperialists also established many military bases on our land, forcing Chinese peasants to leave their fields, brutally beating Chinese people, and even raping Chinese women...! However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people finally overthrew the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and expelled the imperialist aggressors. The miserable life of the people in old China is gone forever.

    In 1956, we will graduate from university! We, along with thousands upon thousands of graduating students, will be assigned by the state to factories, mines, farms, scientific research institutions, and various posts of national construction throughout the country. Each of us will dedicate all our strength to building the motherland into a beautiful garden.

    Finally, we would like to express to you and all Japanese youth our wish, which is also the wish of all Chinese youth—to let the youth of China and Japan enhance mutual understanding and brotherly friendship, and work together for peace and a better future for mankind!

### 北京钢铁工业学院金属压力加工轧钢专业四年级全体学生  给日本青年早濑笙子的信

    北京钢铁工业学院金属压力加工轧钢专业四年级全体学生
    给日本青年早濑笙子的信编辑同志请转
    早濑笙子和爱好和平的日本青年朋友们：
    在人民日报上读到了你热情的来信。我们愿意向你和日本的青年朋友们介绍一下中国学生的生活情况。
    我们是北京钢铁工业学院金属压力加工轧钢专业四年级的全体同学；我们学校的校舍是一九五二年新建的，今年暑假又盖了一座七层的大厦。学校里有宽敞、明亮的教室和设备完善的各种实验室，还有现代化的机械实习工厂。总之，国家为我们创设了目前可能的对学习有利的一切条件！
    在我们的国家里，上大学是不缴学费的。生活困难的学生还可以享受“人民助学金”的待遇，每月不用缴饭费，还可以得到生活零用费，到了冬天还能领到棉衣。因此，我们都无忧无虑地学习着。我们的学习紧密地联系着实际，在低年级的时候在校内的实验室里做实验和实习工厂里进行实习，到了高年级就到校外的工厂里去参加“生产实习”，向工人老大哥学习实际知识。我们还组织了各种科学研究小组，在教员的指导下进行各种有意义的科学研究。
    我们的学习有着一个伟大的目标，就是为了把我们的祖国从经济上落后的农业国建设成一个繁荣富强、工业发达的国家。在这个伟大的目标的鼓舞下，我们每个人在学习中都充分发挥着自己的才能和创造力。目前，我国正在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，我们这些大学生走出学校以后，很快地都要成为国家建设中的有用人材。
    我们的生活也是丰富多彩的。同学们组织了歌咏队、舞蹈队、乐队、诗歌朗诵组和田径队、体操队等。每逢星期六的晚上，我们就举行电影晚会、舞会或者音乐欣赏会，有时还演出同学们自己排演的精采节目。我们尽情地欢乐，愉快地度过每一个周末！
    在我们的国家里，大学生还享受着公费医疗的待遇。同学们有了病，国家就免费给予治疗；身体弱的同学，还可以得到营养补助。只有在人民自己当家作主的国家里，青年才能得到如此亲切的关怀！我们不禁回想起旧中国的悲惨生活。那时候，蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治和帝国主义者的侵略、掠夺，使我国充满了饥馑和灾荒。美帝国主义者还曾经在我们的国土上建立过许多军事基地，他们迫使中国农民离开自己的田地，他们横蛮地殴打中国人民，甚至强奸中国妇女……！但是，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，终于推翻了蒋介石反动统治，驱逐了帝国主义侵略势力。旧中国人民的悲惨生活已经是一去不复还了。
    一九五六年，我们将在大学毕业了！我们和成千成万同时毕业的学生，将由国家分配到全国各地的工厂、矿山、农庄、科学研究机关以及国家建设的各个岗位上去。我们每个人都将为了把祖国建设成一个美丽的花园而献出自己全部的力量。
    最后，我们要向你和所有日本青年表达我们的愿望，也就是全中国青年的愿望——让中日两国青年增进相互间的了解和兄弟般的友谊，为了和平以及人类美好的将来而共同努力！
