Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: A mass meeting demanding an end to the war in Malaya was held in Trafalgar Square, London, on November 13th, according to a London dispatch. The meeting was organized by the London District Council of the British “Movement for Colonial Freedom” and the Southeast Asia Committee. Three Labour Party members of Parliament addressed the assembled crowd.

    The chairman of the meeting, Labour MP Harold Davies, said at the meeting that we believe it is time to awaken the British people to the seriousness of the war in Malaya. He believed that Malaya should have the right to self-determination. Davies called on the British people to urge their government and leaders to conduct negotiations to end the war in Malaya.

    Malayan woman, Linga Radis, told the assembled crowd in the drizzling rain that for more than seven years, the people of Malaya have endured the hateful "Emergency Regulations," 40,000 Malayans have been imprisoned, and 600,000 people have been exiled to so-called "new villages" surrounded by barbed wire. Most of the Malayan people are poor, while enterprises located in Malaya receive profits of millions of dollars (Malayan currency). However, the Malayan people are also forced to pay 30 million pounds a year to maintain a war they do not want.

    Linga Radis asked the British people to urge the government to conduct peace negotiations in Malaya and to enable Malaya to achieve genuine independence.

    Labour MP Bob Edwards said at the meeting that the Malayan war costs the British people 65 million pounds a year.

    Edwards said that Malaya is today a battlefield of imperialism, and Britain is trying to suppress the struggle of the people demanding independence. In this struggle, Britain is destined to fail. Today, no force in the world can stop the great social revolution of our time. Millions of people are demanding freedom and the right to govern their own countries. This revolution cannot be suppressed by armed forces. This suppression has been used in India, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, and China, but it has failed one by one; likewise, it will also fail in Malaya.

    Edwards said that this evil war in Malaya must be ended quickly.

    Another speaker, Abdul Hamid, said that the Malayan war can only be ended by political means, and the only political means acceptable to the Communist Party of Malaya, Malayan political leaders, and the Malayan people is a negotiated solution.

    Labour MP S. Awbery said that we must all dedicate ourselves to getting the British government to agree to end this war.

    Douglas Rogers, General Secretary of the “Movement for Colonial Freedom,” said, "I believe the British government can learn a lesson from France. Despite large-scale military operations in North Africa, the resistance movement against French occupation has continued."

    Leaflets titled “Give Peace and Independence to Malaya!” were distributed at the meeting. The leaflet accused the British authorities of only offering surrender terms and refusing to negotiate an end to the war, and called on the British people to strive to end the Malayan war by various means.

    On November 12th, a parade was also held in London. Participants included Malayans, Britons, Kenyans, West Indians, and Cypriots, holding placards with slogans such as "End the War in Malaya".

    伦敦举行要求停止马来亚战争的群众大会
    据新华社十日讯　伦敦通讯：十一月十三日，在伦敦特拉法加广场举行了一个要求停止对马来亚战争的群众大会。这个大会是英国“争取殖民地自由运动”伦敦区理事会和东南亚委员会所组织的。有三个工党议员向到会的群众讲话。
    大会主席下院工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯在大会上说，我们认为，唤起英国人民认识马来亚战争的严重性，现在已经是时候了。他认为，马来亚应该有自决权。戴维斯号召英国人民促使他们的政府和领袖进行关于结束马来亚战争的谈判。
    马来亚妇女林格拉迪斯在蒙蒙细雨中向到会的群众讲话说，七年多以来，马来亚人民忍受着令人憎恨的“紧急条例”，有四万马来亚人被囚禁，有六十万人被流放在有刺铁丝网环绕的所谓“新村”里。大部分马来亚人民是贫穷的，而设在马来亚的企业却得到数以百万元（马来亚币）计的利润。但是，马来亚人民还被迫要每年付出三千万镑来维持他们所不要的战争。
    林格拉迪斯要求英国人民促使政府在马来亚进行和平谈判，并且使得马来亚可以获得真正的独立。
    下院工党议员鲍布·爱德华兹在会上发言说，马来亚战争使英国人民每年花费六千五百万镑。
    爱德华兹说，马来亚今天是帝国主义的战场，英国企图压制要求独立的人民的斗争，在这个斗争中，英国是注定要失败的。今天世界上没有任何力量能阻止我们这一时代的伟大的社会革命。千百万人民在要求自由，要求管理他们自己国家的权利，这个革命是武装力量压制不住的。这种压制曾经在印度、缅甸、锡兰、埃及、中国使用过，但是，都一一失败了；同样地，它也将在马来亚失败。
    爱德华兹说，在马来亚的这个罪恶的战争必须迅速地结束。
    另一位发言者阿卜杜勒·哈密德说，马来亚战争只可以用政治手段来结束，而马来亚共产党、马来亚政治领袖和马来亚人民可以接受的唯一政治手段是协商解决。
    下院工党议员斯·奥伯里说，我们全体都必须致力于使英国政府同意结束这个战争。
    “争取殖民地自由运动”总书记道格拉斯·罗杰斯说，我认为英国政府可以从法国方面取得教训，法国在北非尽管进行了规模巨大的军事行动，但是，反对法国占领的抵抗运动一直在继续进行中。
    会上散发了题为“给马来亚以和平和独立！”的传单。传单中指责英国当局只是提出纳降的条件而拒不进行结束战争的谈判，并且号召英国人民用各种方法争取结束马来亚战争。
    在十一月十二日，伦敦还举行了一次游行。参加游行的有马来亚人、英国人、怯尼亚人、西印度群岛人、塞浦路斯人，他们高举着标语牌，上面写着“结束马来亚战争”。
