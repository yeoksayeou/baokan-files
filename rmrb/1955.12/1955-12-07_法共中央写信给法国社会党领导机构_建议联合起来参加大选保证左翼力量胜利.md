    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 5th (TASS dispatch) "L'Humanité" published a letter from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party to the leadership of the French Socialist Party. The letter suggests uniting with the French Socialist Party to participate in the National Assembly elections, utilizing the provisions in the electoral law regarding the formation of party alliances to defeat the reactionaries. The letter states that the alliance of Communists and Socialists could win a majority of votes in twenty provinces, and thus be able to obtain all National Assembly seats in those provinces.
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party finally emphasized that other republican parties and groups can also participate in this alliance of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, in order to defeat the reactionaries in most constituencies, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the left-wing forces in the new National Assembly.
    Socialist Party grassroots members are increasingly actively participating in the struggle to strive for the formation of an alliance of French left-wing forces in the election campaign.
    "L'Humanité" reported that many Communists and Socialists in Ardèche, Isère, and Drôme, as well as in several factories in Paris, have signed a joint appeal to unite all truly left-wing forces.
    The "New Left Alliance" issued a statement from its National Committee, urging Communists, Socialists, and Radicals to utilize the provisions regarding the establishment of party alliances to draft a single list of candidates in order to jointly oppose reactionary forces.
    The "Human Rights League" also issued a similar appeal.

    建议联合起来参加大选保证左翼力量胜利
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎五日讯　“人道报”发表了法国共产党中央委员会给法国社会党领导机构的一封信，这封信建议同法国社会党联合起来参加国民议会选举，利用选举法中关于成立党派联盟的规定来击败反动派。这封信说，共产党人和社会党人联合起来就可以在二十个省中取得大多数选票，因而能够取得这些省份的全部国民议会席位。
    法国共产党中央委员会最后强调指出：其他共和党派和集团也可以参加共产党和社会党的这个联盟，以便在大多数选区中击败反动派，从而保证新国民议会中左翼力量的胜利。
    社会党基层党员们正在越来越积极地参加争取法国左翼力量在竞选运动中结成联盟的斗争。
    “人道报”报道，阿尔代歇省、伊塞尔省和德罗摩省以及巴黎的若干工厂中的许多共产党人和社会党人签署了争取所有真正左翼力量团结起来的共同呼吁书。
    “新左翼联盟”发表了它的全国委员会的声明，敦促共产党人、社会党人和激进党人利用关于成立党派联盟的规定，草拟一张单一的候选人名单，以便共同反对反动势力。
    “人权联盟”也发表了类似的呼吁书。
