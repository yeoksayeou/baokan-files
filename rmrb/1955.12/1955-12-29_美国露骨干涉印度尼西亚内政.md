　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 26th: Signs of U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs are becoming increasingly blatant and open.

　　According to an Antara News Agency dispatch from New York on the 22nd, Walter Robertson, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, recently met with two members of the Indonesian delegation to the United Nations—Datuk Ghamin of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association and Gamaluddin Malik—and blatantly expressed his unease about the gains made by the Indonesian Communist Party in the parliamentary elections. Robertson attempted to influence Indonesia's domestic and foreign policies. He insisted that the Indonesian Communist Party was able to achieve such gains because the Indonesian government had "adopted a neutral policy."

    美国露骨干涉印度尼西亚内政
    据新华社雅加达二十六日电　美国干涉印度尼西亚内政的迹象正在愈来愈露骨和公开了。
    据安塔拉通讯社二十二日的纽约消息，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊最近在会见印度尼西亚驻联合国代表团的两个团员——印度尼西亚回教师联合会的达图克·加明和加马卢丁·马利克的时候，曾经露骨地表示对印度尼西亚共产党在国会选举中的收获感到不安。罗伯逊企图影响印度尼西亚的国内和外交政策。他硬说，印度尼西亚共产党所以可能取得这种收获是由于印度尼西亚政府“采取了中立政策”。
