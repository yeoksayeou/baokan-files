Do a Good Job in Piloting Advanced Agricultural Cooperatives
    Shang Kai

    At the recent provincial rural work conference, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward a new task to all rural work cadres: requiring each county and city to start piloting fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives this autumn and winter. This is not only because, in the vast rural areas of the province, many agricultural production cooperatives already possess the conditions to transition to fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives due to the development of production and the continuous growth of socialist factors, as well as the increasing awareness of the members; but also because the distribution system based on payment for land and labor is increasingly unable to adapt to the requirements of further development of the productive forces. That is to say, in these cooperatives, the contradiction between the productive forces and the private ownership of the means of production has become increasingly significant. If these contradictions are not resolved in a timely manner, and the partial collective ownership of the means of production in these cooperatives is not transformed into complete collective ownership, then the development of the productive forces will be restricted.

    Under such a new situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee's proposal to pilot advanced cooperatives is necessary and timely. Therefore, it immediately received warm support from cadres and peasants. What conditions must an agricultural cooperative possess to transition from a lower-level cooperative to an advanced cooperative? The Shanxi Provincial Committee proposed three basic conditions that need to be met for a lower-level cooperative to transition to an advanced cooperative. These are: (1) the cooperative's production is continuously developing, catching up with or exceeding the production level of local wealthy middle peasants; (2) it is guaranteed that after the transition to a fully socialist cooperative, the income of the vast majority of members will not be reduced, and the work and life of elderly, weak, sick, and disabled members can be properly arranged; (3) the socialist consciousness of the members has been raised, and they are genuinely willing to transform the lower-level cooperative into an advanced cooperative. The Shanxi Provincial Committee pointed out that it is necessary to stipulate these three conditions as general conditions for cooperative transformation, because with these three conditions, there is a goal to strive for in the transformation. However, these conditions should not be regarded as passive restrictions on the transition of agricultural cooperatives from lower-level cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, and local areas should implement these conditions according to local conditions. At present, the county committees of various counties in Shanxi are enthusiastically, actively, and systematically carrying out the work of piloting advanced cooperatives.

    The transformation of agricultural production cooperatives from lower-level cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, the abolition of land dividends, and the implementation of public ownership of the main means of production by the cooperative, is another major transformation of the ownership of agricultural means of production, and it is also a sharp and complex struggle. In order to ensure the victorious completion of this historical task, the Shanxi Provincial Committee requires that rural party organizations first conduct more systematic education on the Party's general line during the transition period and on class policies for Communist Party members in agricultural cooperatives, so as to give play to the vanguard role of Communist Party members in the socialist revolution. At the same time, rural party organizations must also do a good job in political and ideological work and economic work in the cooperatives, so as to ensure the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of the members and the continuous growth of socialist economic factors, and actively create conditions for the transition to fully socialist advanced cooperatives.

    做好高级农业合作社的试办工作
    商恺
    中共山西省委在最近召开的全省农村工作会议上，向全体农村工作干部提出了一项新任务：要求每个县、市从今年秋冬开始试办完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。这不仅是因为在全省广大农村中，有许多农业生产合作社由于生产的发展和社会主义因素的不断增长，社员的觉悟程度的提高，已具备了过渡到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社的条件；而另一方面按土地和劳动付酬的分配制度，已经日益不能适应生产力进一步发展的要求。这也就是说，在这些合作社里生产力同生产资料私有制之间的矛盾，已经日益显著。如果不及时地解决这些矛盾，使这些社的生产资料部分集体所有制变为完全的集体所有制，那末，生产力的发展，就要受到限制。
    在这样一种新情况下，山西省委提出试办高级社的要求是必要的，也是适时的。因此，它也就立刻得到了干部和农民的热烈拥护。农业合作社要具备什么样的条件，才能从低级社过渡到高级社呢？山西省委提出了由低级社过渡到高级社需要具备三个基本条件。这就是：（一）社内的生产不断发展，赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平；（二）保证过渡到完全社会主义的合作社以后，绝大部分社员的收入不会降低，老弱病残社员的工作和生活能有所安排；（三）社员的社会主义觉悟程度已经提高，真正自愿把低级社转变为高级社。山西省委指出，规定这三个条件作为一般转社的条件是必要的，因为有了这三个条件，就有了一个争取转社的目标。但是不要把这些条件当作消极的限制农业合作社由低级社过渡到高级社的“清规戒律”，各地对这些条件应因地制宜地去执行。现在，山西各县县委正在热情地积极地有计划地进行试办高级社的工作。
    农业生产合作社由低级社转变成高级社，取消土地分红，实行主要生产资料归社公有，这是农业生产资料所有制的又一次重大的转变，这同样是一场尖锐的复杂的斗争。为了保证这一历史任务的胜利完成，山西省委要求全省农村党组织首先对农业合作社里的共产党员，更有系统地进行过渡时期党的总路线的教育和阶级政策教育，以发挥共产党员在社会主义革命斗争中的先锋作用。同时，农村党组织还必须作好合作社里的政治思想工作和经济工作，以保证社员的社会主义觉悟的不断提高和社会主义经济因素的不断增长，为过渡到完全社会主义的高级社积极地创造条件。
