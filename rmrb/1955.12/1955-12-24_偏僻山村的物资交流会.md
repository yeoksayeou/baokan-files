    Material Exchange Fair in a Remote Mountain Village
    Jianjie Village in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, is a remote mountain village. Together with the surrounding Tangchi and two other villages, it has 1,700 households and more than 5,900 residents. Its main products are grain, oil, and handmade paper. After liberation, agricultural production developed, and farmers' purchasing power increased. However, there is no market in Jianjie Village. If the masses want to buy things, they have to go to the market town twenty or thirty miles away, which takes a whole day. In November, when the mountain villages are busy with farming, the masses don't have time to go twenty or thirty miles away to sell agricultural and sideline products and buy industrial products.
    In order to adapt to this situation, the Jibu branch of the Gan County Jiangkou District Supply and Marketing Cooperative dispatched 13 staff members on November 23, along with the grain department, food company, Gan County Tea Picking Opera Troupe, and the United Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic. They also brought five organized private merchants to transport goods to Jianjie Village and hold a small-scale material exchange fair.
    The exchange fair was very successful. It supplied industrial products such as cotton cloth and rubber shoes worth more than 1,400 yuan to the farmers and purchased agricultural products such as rice, tea oil, handmade paper, and live pigs worth more than 840 yuan.
    Holding small-scale material exchange fairs during the busy farming season is a good way to meet the needs of farmers to purchase industrial products, purchase agricultural and sideline products to support production and export, and save farmers' production time.

    偏僻山村的物资交流会
    江西省赣县建节村，是一个偏僻的山村，连周围的塘池等三村共有居民一千七百户，五千九百多人，主要出产粮食、油料和土纸。解放后农业生产发展，农民购买力提高。但是建节村没有市场，群众要买东西就要赶到二、三十里外的圩镇去，来回要耽搁一天。十一月山村农忙，群众要出售农副产品和购买工业品，都没有时间赶到二、三十里外去。
    赣县江口区供销合作社吉埠分社为适应这一情况，在十一月二十三日抽出工作人员十三人，配合粮食部门、食品公司和赣县采茶剧团、中医联合诊所，还带了五户已经组织起来的私商，把货物运到建节村，召开小型物资交流会。
    这次交流会的收获很大。供应了农民价值一千四百多元的棉布、胶鞋等工业品；收购了价值八百四十多元的稻谷、茶油、土纸、生猪等农产品。
    在农忙时节办小型物资交流会的办法很好，既可以满足农民购买工业品的需要，收购农副产品支援生产和出口，又能节省农民的生产时间。
