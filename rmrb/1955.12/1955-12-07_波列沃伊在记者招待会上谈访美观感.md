Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 3rd (TASS)—The Soviet journalists' delegation, which recently visited the United States, held a press conference on December 2nd. Boris Polevoi, the head of the delegation, made a statement at the conference. The statement said:

    Our delegation of seven traveled in the United States for thirty-three days. We crossed the United States twice from coast to coast via different routes, passing through places including New York, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Reno, Virginia City, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hollywood, Phoenix, Washington, and back to New York. When we arrived in the United States, we said: we hope to see the best of everything that the American people are proud of, and we believe that those responsible for arranging our trip did their best to satisfy our wishes.

    We now want to answer a question that people kept asking us along the way: What did we like and dislike in the United States?

    We liked the skyscrapers of New York and the comfortable houses in the small cities scattered among the green fields on both sides of American highways. We liked the Lincoln Tunnel and the bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland. We liked those highways and the latest model cars driving on them. We liked the beautiful symphony music we heard in Washington and Cleveland, and the organ concert we enjoyed in Salt Lake City.

    We liked seeing these achievements of American culture and engineering, but we very much disliked it when groups of irresponsible and drunken troublemakers—who somehow knew about our journey even earlier than we did—disturbed us with disgusting performances. As a result of this performance, one of our American guides was slightly injured, and a black driver who used his body to protect us was beaten. Think about it, our Western colleagues, what kind of reports would you write if you were surrounded in a hotel in Moscow on a fine day by a group of drunken hooligans holding placards insulting you and your country?

    Wherever we went, we were received with kindness and friendliness, whether it was at universities, churches, governors' offices, film studios, modern factories, editorial offices, or television stations. We did not request to visit areas that are forbidden to Soviet citizens. But wherever we visited, people were willing to show us everything and tell us about everything. We liked this very much. However, in some cities, there were two or three officially dispatched burly, thug-like secret agents tailing us, following us wherever we went, even to the swimming pool, and even—excuse me for saying it—to the restroom. We did not like this kind of thing—not only did we not like it, we also felt insulted. At the New York airport, we seven people were greeted by thirty-nine police officers and three plainclothes officers.

    Our dear foreign colleagues, if you were greeted by so many police officers at the Moscow airport, and if you were tailed on the streets of Moscow by burly gentlemen with pistols in their hip pockets, then it is easy to imagine what you would think of our hospitality and of the rights of foreign journalists in our country.

    Every time we arrived in a new place, we received many invitations from complete strangers asking us to come to their homes and spend a casual evening with them. We gladly accepted their invitations, and we split into groups of two, three, or even four to visit American families, visiting people in various industries. We were very happy to find that we did not encounter a single person among them who advocated a "position of strength" policy, or who dreamed of war or believed that war was inevitable. On the contrary, we found everywhere that people longed for coexistence between different social systems, longed for mutual understanding, longed for the exchange of cultural treasures, longed for mutually beneficial trade, and longed for peace written with a capital letter. We liked all of this very, very much. However, newspapers almost never publish these opinions that people often express repeatedly; instead, they often publish banner headlines reminiscent of the most intense era of the "Cold War," and we do not like this kind of thing at all. Also, as soon as we arrived in the United States, we telegraphed requesting a meeting with U.S. government officials, but not a single U.S. government official was willing to meet with us or talk to us. To be honest, we members of the first Soviet journalists' delegation to visit the United States did not like this.

    Overall, we would like to tell you very happily that what we liked most in the United States was the energetic, vibrant, and cheerful American people, who know how to work, who can joke, who love to sing, and who overwhelmingly demand peace, demand understanding, demand mutually beneficial trade, demand the exchange of cultural treasures, and demand common prosperity.

    波列沃伊在记者招待会上谈访美观感
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科三日电　最近曾经访问美国的苏联新闻工作者代表团，在十二月二日举行了记者招待会，代表团团长鲍里斯·波列沃伊在招待会上发表了声明。声明说：
    我们的七人代表团在美国旅行了三十三天。我们经过不同的路线，从海岸到海岸横跨美国两次，途中经过的地方包括纽约、克利夫兰、盐湖城、瑞诺、弗吉尼亚城、萨克拉门托、旧金山、洛杉矶、好莱坞、费匿克斯、华盛顿，又回到纽约。我们在到达美国的时候说：我们希望看到美国人民所引以自豪的一切最好的东西，我们认为，负责安排我们的旅行的人们，尽了他们最大力量来满足我们的愿望。
    我们现在要回答在我们一路上人们总是在问我们的一个问题：在美国，我们喜欢什么，不喜欢什么。
    我们喜欢纽约的摩天楼和在美国公路两侧的绿野中星罗棋布的小城市的舒适的住宅。我们喜欢林肯大隧道和连接旧金山与奥克兰的大桥。我们喜欢那些公路和行驶在公路上面的最新式的汽车。我们喜欢我们在华盛顿和克利夫兰所听到的优美的交响乐和我们在盐湖城所欣赏的风琴演奏会。
    我们喜欢看到美国文化和工程方面的这些成就，但是，当成群不负责任和喝醉了的吵闹分子——他们用某种方法甚至比我们都更早地知道了我们的旅程——用令人发呕的表演来打扰我们的时候，我们是非常不喜欢的。由于这种表演，我们的一位美国向导受了微伤，一位用自己的身体来保护我们的黑人司机挨了打。请想想吧，我们西方的同业们，如果在天高气爽的一天，你们在莫斯科某一个旅馆内被一群拿着侮辱你们和你们国家的标语牌的喝醉了的流氓所包围，你们将写些什么报道。
    我们不论到什么地方，都受到了亲切和友好的招待，不管是大学也好，教堂也好，州长的客厅也好，影片制片厂也好，现代化工厂也好，编辑部也好，电视台也好。我们没有要求参观禁止苏联公民参观的地区。但是凡是我们所参观到的地方，人们都很愿意给我们看每一样东西，对我们讲每一件东西。我们对这些是非常喜欢的。但是，在有些城市，有两三名官方派遣的彪形大汉式的密探钉我们的梢，我们到哪里他们就到哪里，甚至钉到游泳池，还甚至——请原谅我说出来——钉到厕所。我们对这种事情是不喜欢的——不仅是不喜欢，我们还感到受了侮辱。在纽约机场上，我们七个人受到了三十九名警察和三名便衣的接待。
    我们亲爱的外国同业们，如果你们在莫斯科机场上受到这样多的警察的接待，如果你们在莫斯科街上被屁股口袋中装着手枪的彪形大汉先生们钉梢，那末，很容易想像你们对我们的招待以及对外国记者在我国境内的权利会有些什么想法。
    我们每到一个新的地方，总是接到了来自完全不相识的人们的许多邀请，要求我们到他们家中去和他们共度一个不拘束的夜晚。我们很高兴地接受了他们的邀请，我们分成两批、三批甚至四批，去访问美国家庭，访问各种不同行业的人民。我们很高兴地发现我们在他们中间没有碰到过一个鼓吹“凭借实力地位”政策的人，或者一个梦想战争或认为战争是不可避免的人。相反的，我们在各处都发现人们渴望不同社会制度的共处，渴望相互谅解，渴望文化珍品的交流，渴望互利的贸易，渴望用一个大写字母来开头的和平。这一切，我们都是非常非常喜欢的。但是，报纸却几乎从来不刊载人们常常一再表示的这些意见，它们时常刊载令人回想起“冷战”最激烈的时代的那些通栏标题，我们对这种事情是一点也不喜欢的。还有，我们一到达美国的时候就用电报请求美国政府官员接见我们，但是没有一个美国政府官员愿意接见我们或者和我们谈一次话，说老实话，我们这些第一个到美国去访问的苏联新闻工作者代表团的团员们对这件事是不喜欢的。
    总起来说，我们愿意非常高兴地告诉你们，我们在美国最喜欢的就是精力旺盛、生气勃勃和愉快活泼的美国人民，他们知道如何工作，他们会开玩笑，他们爱唱歌，他们绝大多数要求和平，要求谅解，要求互利的贸易，要求文化珍品的交流，要求共同繁荣。
