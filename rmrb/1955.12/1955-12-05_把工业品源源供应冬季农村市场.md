    With a bumper harvest across the country this year, the total output of grain and cotton has exceeded the state plan. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, grain production has increased by more than 20 billion jin compared to last year, and cotton production has increased by about 6 million dan. The purchasing power of farmers in the second half of this year has increased significantly compared to the same period last year, and it is more concentrated. Especially since mid-October, as the "three fixings" of grain have been mostly completed in various regions, farmers' purchasing power has poured into the market, and the demand for industrial products is even greater. This was originally a favorable condition for state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives to complete this year's sales plans. However, since the beginning of autumn, an undesirable phenomenon has appeared in the rural market: many industrial products are severely out of stock, while the state-owned commercial sector's sales plan for the third quarter has not been completed well. Although the situation of industrial products being out of stock in various regions has begun to improve since early October, and the completion of state-owned commercial sales plans in mid- and late-October has been relatively good, the rural market is now entering a peak season. If state-owned commercial departments do not redouble their efforts during this period and do a good job in supplying industrial products to the countryside in winter, it will not only affect the completion of the state-owned commercial commodity circulation plan, but also prevent farmers from buying the industrial products they need after selling agricultural products, which will also affect the purchase of agricultural products.
    Doing a good job in supplying industrial products to the rural market in winter is the joint responsibility of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, and the work of transferring industrial products from factories to grassroots sales units should mainly be the responsibility of state-owned commercial departments. In this regard, some state-owned commercial departments have shortcomings. For example, in the third quarter of this year, many state-owned stores believed that they had sufficient supplies and could cope with the needs of the peak season market, complaining that grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives were not actively or timely in purchasing goods, resulting in many commodities being out of stock; but after September, due to the sudden increase in purchases by supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas, there was a phenomenon of insufficient inventory and incomplete varieties in many state-owned stores, exposing the tendency of state-owned companies' grassroots wholesale departments to have small and conservative plans in preparing for peak season supplies. This has prevented industrial products from meeting the needs of the rural market. The state-owned store in Bailing Temple, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, had a daily turnover of only 500 to 600 yuan before the completion of the "three fixings" of grain. After the completion of the "three fixings" of grain, the turnover reached 5,800 yuan on the first day, and the average daily turnover was 3,000 to 4,000 yuan in the following days. The sales volume of state-owned companies in Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Henan, Liaoning, Shaanxi and other provinces in mid-October increased by 22% to 85% compared with early October. This upward trend will generally develop throughout the country. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are now replenishing their stocks. The quantity of goods purchased by grassroots cooperatives is generally 30% to 40% larger than the original plan. Under these circumstances, state-owned companies also feel somewhat caught off guard.
    Obviously, many staff members of state-owned commercial departments have underestimated the rural market after this year's bumper harvest, and they have an even more inadequate understanding of the concentrated purchasing power of farmers after the autumn harvest. Therefore, they have adopted an empiricist, conservative, and hesitant approach in preparing for the winter supply of industrial products. This approach is detrimental to coordinating the purchase of peak season agricultural products, to completing this year's commodity circulation plan, and to the currently thriving agricultural cooperative movement. The more our socialist construction and socialist transformation develop, the more the purchasing power of farmers will increase. In the future, the demand for industrial products from the vast number of farmers will increase year by year every winter. Commercial workers should learn from this year's lessons and fully recognize this characteristic. Every year, preparations should be made before the peak season arrives, so that when the autumn harvest season arrives, a large supply of industrial products suitable for farmers' needs can be supplied to the rural market. This is the responsibility that socialist commercial workers should have.
    The key to doing a good job in supplying industrial products to the rural market in winter lies in improving the supply work of state-owned commercial departments and closely combining state-owned commerce with supply and marketing cooperatives.
    State-owned commercial departments must improve the supply of industrial products in all aspects. First of all, it is necessary to organize good quality and reasonably priced commodities to meet the needs of farmers in winter. At present, the main industrial products that farmers need but are in short supply are: good quality cotton cloth, Shilin blue cloth, bed sheets, quilt covers, wool, cardigan sweaters, sugar, rubber shoes, etc. The central wholesale stations of state-owned companies should, in accordance with the purchase and supply plan, urge factories to produce, and in accordance with the purchase and supply contract, take delivery of goods from factories in a timely manner and quickly transport them to secondary wholesale stations in various regions for transshipment to grassroots stores. State-owned commercial stations and stores at all levels have the responsibility to represent consumers in conveying opinions on the color, variety, and quality of goods to the industrial departments in order to help industrial departments improve product quality and increase the variety of colors and varieties that meet the needs of urban and rural people. Secondly, state-owned companies must ensure that the goods are sufficient and the varieties are complete, so that buyers can have a choice. Some industrial products, unlike grain, are often not needed in advance and must be purchased, but are purchased only after buyers see the goods and feel that they are needed. Therefore, the wholesale or retail departments of state-owned companies should display samples of various commodities, marked with prices, in order to attract customers to choose and buy. If the colors and varieties are incomplete, or if there are goods in the warehouse but the retail department does not display them, it will affect customers' selection and purchase, and prevent the goods from reaching consumers and meeting their needs. Thirdly, the department store wholesale institutions of state-owned commerce should appropriately go deeper in order to facilitate the allocation of industrial products to the countryside for supply. The practice of Anhui Province in deepening the wholesale institutions of state-owned department stores into county towns and large market towns has played a certain role in ensuring the supply of industrial products in rural areas. For example, in Feidong County, with a population of 780,000, the state-owned company has established nine wholesale distribution points in larger market towns, each distribution point supplying a range of one district or two or three districts, eight or nine small market towns, four or five cooperatives, two or three hundred small merchants and peddlers, and 50,000 to 78,000 people (the most supplying 100,000 people). The benefits of doing this are: department stores have a better understanding of what commodities farmers need, and the commodities transferred to grassroots stores are more suitable for farmers' needs; department store commodities can be allocated to rural areas in a timely manner, making it easy for supply and marketing cooperatives and small merchants and peddlers to purchase goods, making grassroots retail units well-stocked. This greatly facilitates the expansion of commodity circulation and meets the needs of farmers.
    To do a good job in supplying industrial products to the rural market in winter, state-owned commerce must closely combine with supply and marketing cooperatives, help supply and marketing cooperatives in all aspects, and work together to improve their work. State-owned companies and stores must meet the requirements of the commodity plans proposed by supply and marketing cooperatives to state-owned companies and stores as much as possible, and supply goods on time, always keeping grassroots cooperatives well-stocked and with a full range of colors. State-owned companies and stores should regularly hold supplementary commodity requisition meetings, inviting representatives from supply and marketing cooperatives to participate, and the supply and marketing cooperatives should submit supplementary commodity requisition plans in order to supplement supplies. Or, state-owned stores should send people to carry commodity catalogs, and if necessary, carry samples, to visit grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to promote commodities; or grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should send people to state-owned stores to select and purchase commodities as needed. In addition, holding supply meetings, experience exchange meetings, and commodity exhibitions attended by both state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives are all effective working methods for expanding commodity circulation and ensuring rural supply. Various localities can flexibly use them according to specific circumstances in order to continuously supply a large number of industrial products to the winter rural market.

### 把工业品源源供应冬季农村市场

    把工业品源源供应冬季农村市场
    今年全国农业丰收，粮食和棉花总产量都超过国家计划。根据农业部初步预计，粮食比去年增产二百多亿斤，棉花比去年增产六百万担左右。今年下半年农民的购买力比去年同期有显著增加，而且更加集中，特别是十月中旬以来，由于各地粮食“三定”工作已经大部分完成，农民购买力拥入市场，对工业品的需要量就更大。这本来是国营商业和供销合作社完成今年销售计划的有利条件。但是，入秋以来，在农村市场上却出现了一种不应有的现象：许多工业品严重脱销，而国营商业第三季度的销售计划却完成得很不好。虽然十月上旬以后，各地工业品脱销情况已经开始好转，十月中旬和下旬国营商业的销售计划完成情况也比较好，目前农村市场正进入大旺的季节，这个旺季还有两个多月的时间，如果国营商业部门在这个期间不加倍努力，做好冬季工业品下乡供应工作，那末，不但会影响国营商业商品流转计划的完成，而且会使农民在出售农产品以后，买不到他们所需要的工业品，也将影响农产品的收购。
    做好冬季农村市场的工业品供应工作，是国营商业和供销合作社共同的责任，而把工业品从生产的工厂转到销售的基层单位去的工作，主要应当由国营商业部门负责进行。在这一方面，有些国营商业部门是有缺点的。如今年第三季度曾有不少国营商店认为自己货源充足，可以应付旺季市场的需要，埋怨基层供销合作社进货不积极或进货不及时，以致许多商品脱销；但到了九月以后，由于某些地区供销合作社突然增加进货，却又出现了不少国营商店备货不足、品种不全的现象，暴露了国营公司的基层批发部门，在准备旺季供应方面的计划偏小和保守的倾向。这样就使工业品不能供应农村市场的需要。湖南湘阴县白伶寺的国营商店在粮食“三定”工作没有完成以前，每天的营业额只有五百至六百元，粮食“三定”工作完成以后，第一天的营业额就达到五千八百元，以后几天平均每天也有三千至四千元。湖北、湖南、浙江、河南、辽宁、陕西等省国营公司十月中旬的销货额，比十月上旬上升百分之二十二至百分之八十五。这种上升的趋势，在全国各地还会普遍发展。现在各地供销合作社正在补充进货。基层合作社增加进货的数量，一般要比原计划扩大百分之三十到四十。在这种情况下，国营公司也就感到有些措手不及了。
    很显然，不少国营商业部门的工作人员，对于今年丰收以后的农村市场是估计不足的，对于秋收以后农民购买力这样集中更加认识不足，因此在准备冬季工业品供应工作方面，采取了经验主义的、保守的、缩手缩脚的做法。这种做法，对于配合旺季农产品的收购，对于完成今年的商品流转计划，对于目前正在蓬勃发展的农业合作化运动，都是不利的。我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业越往前发展，农民购买力越提高，今后每年冬季，广大农民对于工业品的需要量将会逐年增大。商业工作者应当吸取今年的教训，充分地认识到这一个特点。每年要在旺季没有到来以前，就要做好准备工作，以便在秋后旺季一到，就能有适合农民需要的工业品大量供应农村市场。这是社会主义商业工作者应有的责任。
    做好冬季农村市场工业品供应工作的关键，在于改进国营商业部门的供应工作，密切国营商业同供销合作社的结合。
    国营商业部门要从各方面来改进工业品的供应工作。首先，要组织品质好、价格合适的商品来满足农民在冬季里的需要。目前，农民很需要而供应不足的工业品，主要的有：质量好的棉布、士林蓝布、被单布、被面、毛线、开襟绒衣、食糖、胶鞋等等。这些商品，国营公司的中央批发站应该按照采购供应计划，督促工厂生产，按照采购供应合同，向工厂及时取货，迅速运送到各地二级批发站，转运到基层商店去。国营商业的各级站、店，有责任代表消费者向工业部门反映对商品的花色、品种、质量好坏的意见，以帮助工业部门改进产品质量，增加适合城乡人民需要的花色品种。其次，国营公司要做到货色充足，品种齐全，让购买者有所选择。有些工业品不像粮食，往往不是事前感到需要而非买不可的，而是购买者看到商品以后，觉得需要才决定购买的。因此，国营公司的批发部或零售部，应当把各种商品的样品陈列出来，标明价格，以吸引顾客选购。如果花色品种不全，或者仓库有货而门市部不陈列出来，都会影响到顾客选购，使商品不能到消费者手里，不能满足消费者的需要。第三，国营商业的百货批发机构，要适当深入下去，以便于调拨工业品下乡供应。安徽省把国营百货公司的批发机构深入县城和大集镇的做法，对于保证农村工业品的供应曾经起了一定作用。例如在一个有七十八万人口的肥东县，国营公司就在较大的集镇设立了九个批发分销处，每个分销处供应的范围是一个区或二、三个区，八、九个小集镇，四、五个合作社，二、三百户小商小贩，五万至七、八万人口（最多的供应十万人）。这样做法的好处是：百货公司对农民需要什么商品比较了解，调到基层商店去的商品就比较适合农民需要；百货公司的商品能够及时调拨到农村，便于供销合作社和小商小贩进货，使基层零售单位的商品充足。这就大大地便利于扩大商品的流转，满足农民的需要。
    要做好冬季农村市场的工业品供应工作，国营商业必须同供销合作社密切结合，从各方面去帮助供销合作社，共同努力，改进工作。供销合作社向国营公司、商店提出的要货计划，国营公司、商店必须尽可能满足它们的要求，并且按时供给货源，经常保持基层社的商品充足，花色齐全。国营公司、商店应当定期召开补充要货会议，请供销合作社派员参加，由供销合作社提出补充要货计划，以便补充供应。或者由国营商店派人携带商品目录，必要时携带样品，巡回到基层供销合作社推销商品；或者由基层供销合作社派员到国营商店，根据需要选购商品。此外，召开国营商业和供销合作社双方参加的供应会议、经验交流会议和商品展览会等方式，都是扩大商品流转、保证农村供应的有效的工作方法。各地可以根据具体情况，灵活运用，以便把大量工业品源源不断地供应冬季农村市场。
