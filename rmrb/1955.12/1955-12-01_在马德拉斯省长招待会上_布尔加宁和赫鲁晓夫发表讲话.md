Xinhua News Agency, Madras, December 29th (via TASS) - The Governor of Madras Province, India, Prakasa, held a reception on the evening of November 28th to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev.

    In his speech, the Governor touched on many issues, including industrialization, Sino-Indian cultural exchanges, and the commonalities between the peoples of India and the Soviet Union in their historical struggles for freedom and independence.

    Bulganin thanked the Governor for his warm words about the Soviet people. He said that the most important point that united them was that the people of both countries wanted peaceful coexistence and prosperity. Bulganin also stressed the significance of the growing cultural ties between the Soviet Union and India.

    Khrushchev then spoke. He made particular reference to the Governor's opinion that, for Madras Province, industrialization and socialization were "not the way out of all disasters." Khrushchev stressed that he was only expressing his own opinion and had no intention of forcing anyone to accept it. He said: We firmly believe that there is no other way for mankind to improve its well-being other than through the development of industry. Is it possible to feed and clothe 400 million people, build houses for them, and guarantee all the necessities without developing industry? It is impossible to achieve this without developing industry.

    Khrushchev agreed with the Governor's view that there were many things in common between the Soviet and Indian peoples. He stressed that he believed that the reason why Indians expressed their feelings towards the Soviet Union so enthusiastically was primarily because Indians saw the new things that the Soviet state had created. Khrushchev stressed that the most important of the new things was that, in the Soviet Union, an ordinary person had been elevated to a height he had never imagined.

    Khrushchev finally raised his glass, amid stormy applause, to the friendship between the Soviet Union and India, and to the health of all those present.

    After the banquet, a performance of music and singing by various ethnic groups from South India was held.

    在马德拉斯省长招待会上
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫发表讲话
    新华社据塔斯社马德拉斯二十九日讯　印度马德拉斯省长普拉卡萨在十一月二十八日晚间举行招待会，欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    省长在讲话中谈到许多问题，其中包括工业化、苏印文化交流、印苏两国人民在争取自由和独立斗争的历史中的共同点等。
    布尔加宁感谢省长对苏联人民所讲的热情的话。他说，使得我们团结起来的最重要之点，就是两国人民都希望和平共处和繁荣。布尔加宁还着重指出了苏联和印度两国之间的日益增长的文化联系的意义。
    赫鲁晓夫接着讲话。他特别提到省长所讲的这种意见：对于马德拉斯省，工业化和社会化“并不是摆脱一切灾难的出路”。赫鲁晓夫着重指出：他只是表示自己的意见，完全不想强迫任何人接受他的意见。他说：我们深深相信，除了发展工业的道路以外，人类没有另外一条提高自己生活福利的道路。不发展工业难道能够使四亿人民吃饱穿暖，为他们建筑起房屋并且保证一切必需品吗？不发展工业是不可能达到这种地步的。
    赫鲁晓夫同意省长的这种看法：苏联和印度人民中间有着不少的共同之处。他着重指出：他认为，印度人之所以热烈地表示他们对苏联的情感，首先是因为印度人看到了苏维埃国家所创造的新的事物。赫鲁晓夫着重说，在新事物中最主要的就是：在苏联，一个普通人已经提高到他从来没有想到过的高度。
    赫鲁晓夫最后在暴风雨般的掌声中举杯祝贺苏印两国的友谊，祝贺所有出席的人的健康。
    宴会后，举行了南印度各民族的音乐和歌唱表演会。
