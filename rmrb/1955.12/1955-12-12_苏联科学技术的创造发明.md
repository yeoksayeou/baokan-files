    Soviet Scientific and Technological Creations and Inventions
    The Atomic Ship of the Future
    Chernov, Vice Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Soviet River Transport Department, and engineer Bogdanov recently wrote in the Soviet magazine "Young Technology" that in the near future, a ship powered by atomic energy will navigate the Arctic Ocean along the Soviet northern coast.
    This ship will have a displacement of 25,000 tons, equipped with a propeller with a maximum power of 40,000 horsepower, and a speed of 45 kilometers per hour. The nuclear reactor on board can generate 200,000 kilowatts of heat energy, more than half of which will be used to generate steam to turn the turbine. The remaining part of the heat energy will be used to generate the pressure necessary for extremely powerful water pumps. Two streams of water, ejected by the pump under hundreds of atmospheres of pressure, will pierce the ice layer like two sharp blades, opening up the way for navigation in the Arctic Ocean. Even perennial ice cannot withstand the ship's advance in front of these two streams of water.
    All work on the ship is done by electricity. Electricity plays a special role in manipulating the ship and its many complex machines and systems. The central control panel uses buttons to start, regulate, and shut down the nuclear reactor, turbines, generators, and all auxiliary machines. An electric automatic pilot enables the ship to travel in the designated direction, while radar and underwater radar exploration devices can predict everything on the route.
    The entire device of this future atomic ship, if it works continuously throughout the year, will consume 78 kilograms of uranium. The same ship with a conventional boiler device would require about 150,000 tons of oil per year.
    Future Atomic Trains and Airplanes
    Zakharchenko, the author of an article entitled "Peaceful Atom" published in the 45th issue of the Soviet magazine "Spark," said when talking about future trains that a locomotive equipped with fuel that can travel hundreds of thousands of kilometers will run on new railways. This locomotive will be equipped with an atomic reactor, turbine, generator, and motor. Until now, the development of railway transportation has been limited by the inability to expand the tracks. However, in the future, wide-gauge railway lines with roadbeds two to three times wider than the current ones can be built. In this way, the carriages will become wider and brighter, like the living room of an ocean liner or a house on wheels. Such a future train can travel 40,000 kilometers, or around the Earth, with just one kilogram of uranium. Zakharchenko went on to say that the future of aviation will also advance by leaps and bounds. The main obstacle to airplanes flying far and high now is the limited fuel carried by the aircraft. Thus, in our imagination, there appears such an aircraft, which is a giant arrow-shaped aircraft equipped with a powerful atomic engine. This engine may be the atomic reactor we already know equipped with a turbojet engine, or it may be a uranium powder engine, which mixes uranium powder with the inhaled air to heat the engine, just like the current jet engine. This aircraft will not only have comfortable cabins, but also movie theaters, living rooms, dining rooms, bathrooms, and cargo holds for loading goods, cars, and items. This plane does not have to worry about fuel problems. It can fly at high altitudes, in the uppermost layer of the atmosphere. Because the air resistance there is very small, the speed of this aircraft can reach 10,000 to 20,000 kilometers per hour. It will actually only take passengers a few hours to travel from one continent to another. The plane may not even need to land. Airships can fly along a fixed route for a long time, and passengers can be picked up and dropped off by small planes.
    New Remote Control Device
    Soviet scientists have recently created a novel remote control and electrical signal device. It has a small platform and two relay racks, which can be used to control any equipment and linkage at a very long distance through wires or radio. The electrical signal of this device can be transmitted accurately in 0.2 seconds, which is 10 to 45 times faster than existing telecommunications devices. Moreover, it can transmit signals simultaneously using occupied telephone lines.

    苏联科学技术的创造发明
    未来的原子船
    苏联河运部科学技术委员会副主席切尔诺夫和工程师波格丹诺夫最近在苏联“青年技术”杂志上写的一篇文章里说，在不久的将来，一种利用原子能发电推进的船只，将在苏联北部沿海的北冰洋上通航。
    这种船的排水量达二万五千吨，装有最大功率达四万马力的螺旋推进器，时速四十五公里。船上的核子反应堆可以发出二十万瓩的热能，其中一半以上用来产生蒸汽，以便转动汽轮机。其余一部分的热能用来产生极其强大的抽水机所必需的压力。两股水流在几百大气压下由抽水机射出，像两把利刃似地刺向冰层，为在北冰洋中航行开辟道路。在这两股水流前面，即使多年的极冰也抵挡不住船只的前进。
    船上的一切工作都用电力来做。在操纵船只及其众多而复杂的机械和系统方面，电力起着特别的作用。中央操纵台用按钮开动、调节和关闭核子反应堆、涡轮机、发电机和一切辅助机器。电力自动舵手使船只循着指定的方向行驶，而雷达和水下雷达探索装置则能够预测航路上的一切情况。
    这种未来原子船的整个装置如果一年到头不间断地工作，需要耗费七十八公斤铀。而如果是用普通锅炉装置的同样的船只，每年大约需要十五万吨石油。
    未来的原子火车和飞机
    苏联“星火”杂志第四十五期发表的一篇题为“和平原子”的文章的作者扎哈尔钦科在谈到未来的火车时说，一种装有可以行驶几十万公里的燃料的机车将在新的铁道上奔驰。这种机车上将装置有原子反应堆、涡轮机、发电机和电动机。直到现在为止，铁路运输的发展一直受到轨道不能扩大的限制。但是，将来可以建筑起路基比现在宽两倍到三倍的宽轨铁路线。这样，车厢就会变得又宽又亮，就像是远洋轮船的客厅或者带车轮的房屋一样。这种未来的列车只要装一公斤的铀就能够走四万公里，即绕地球一周。扎哈尔钦科接着说，未来的航空事业也会突飞猛进。现在飞机飞不远、飞不高的主要障碍是飞机所带的燃料有限。于是在我们的想像中就出现了这样一种飞机，它是装有马力极大的原子发动机的巨型箭式飞机。这种发动机可能就是我们已经知道的配备有涡轮喷气发动机的原子反应堆，或者就是铀粉发动机，这种铀粉同吸入的空气混在一起加热发动机，就像现在的喷气发动机的情形一样。在这种飞机上不仅有舒适的客舱，不仅有电影厅、客厅、饭厅、浴室，而且还有装载货物、汽车和物品用的机舱。这种飞机不必担心燃料的问题。它可以在高空，在大气层的最上层飞行。由于那里的空气阻力十分小，这种飞机的飞行速度可以达到每小时一万公里到两万公里。旅客从一个大洲到另一个大洲，实际上只要几小时就够了。飞机甚至连着陆都可以不需要。空中飞艇可以长期地沿着一定的航线飞行，旅客的上下可以用一些小型的飞机来接送。
    新远距离操纵装置
    苏联科学家最近创造了一种新奇的远距离操纵和电信号装置。它有一个小台子和两个替续器架，利用它们就能经过电线或无线电操纵距离很远的任何器械和联动机。这种装置的电信号能在零点二秒钟内精确地传到，比现有的电信装置要快十到四十五倍。而且，它能利用被占用的电话线路同时传递信号。
