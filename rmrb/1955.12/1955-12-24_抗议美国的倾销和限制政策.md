    Protest Against U.S. Dumping and Restriction Policies
    Pakistani Constituent Assembly Member
    Pakistani Constituent Assembly member Noon recently issued a statement to the press condemning the U.S. policy of dumping cotton.
    The statement pointed out that the drop in Pakistani cotton prices from 90 rupees per maund (approximately 37 kilograms) in September to 76 rupees in December was due to the impact of U.S. cotton dumping. The statement said that U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson recently issued a statement saying that the United States may export cotton at competitive prices. This statement greatly impacted the Pakistani cotton market. He said that this statement "is definitely responsible for the severe volatility of cotton prices in the world market."
    Japanese Ambassador to the United States
    Kyodo News Agency reporter Ishizuka reported from Boston, USA, that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Sadao Iguchi delivered a speech at the International Issues Association in Boston on December 15, "strongly criticizing" the U.S. activities to greatly restrict Japanese cotton cloth imports. Iguchi Sadao said that Japan is one of the three major customers of the United States and has a huge trade deficit with the United States – Japan's total exports to the United States are less than one-third of the United States' exports to Japan. He believes that the United States should buy more Japanese goods.
    At the same time, news came from Tokyo that the Japanese government had further succumbed to the will of the United States. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced on December 16 that, starting from December 21, exports of 19 types of cotton fabric products, such as overalls and sweatshirts, would require export licenses. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said that this measure is to enable the Japanese government to strengthen restrictions on the export of these goods to the United States.
    New Zealand Government
    Washington News: New Zealand Ambassador to the United States Munro protested against the United States dumping dairy products abroad in a note to the U.S. State Department on the 18th.
    The note stated that this practice harmed New Zealand's export market. The note requested the United States to revise its dairy product handling plan and stop the dumping and export subsidy system. (Xinhua News Agency)

    抗议美国的倾销和限制政策
    巴基斯坦制宪议会议员
    巴基斯坦制宪议会议员努恩在最近向报界发表声明，谴责美国倾销棉花的政策。
    声明指出，巴基斯坦棉花价格由九月份的每芒特（约合三十七公斤）九十卢比跌到十二月份的七十六卢比是受美国倾销棉花的影响。声明说，最近美国农业部长本逊发表声明说，美国可能以竞争的价格出口棉花。这一声明大大打击了巴基斯坦的棉花市场。他说，这个声明“肯定地应对世界市场的棉花价格的严重动荡负责”。
    日本驻美国大使
    据共同社记者石塚从美国波士顿报道，日本驻美国大使井口贞夫十二月十五日在波士顿的国际问题协会发表演说，“强烈指责”美国要大大限制日本棉布进口的活动。井口贞夫说，日本是美国的三个大主顾之一，而且对美国的贸易有着巨额入超——日本向美国输出的总额还不到美国向日本输出的总额的三分之一。他认为，美国应该更多地购买日本货。
    与此同时，却从东京传来了日本政府进一步向美国意志屈服的消息。日本通商产业省已经在十二月十六日宣布，从十二月二十一日起，罩衣、运动衫等十九种棉布制成品的出口，需要领取许可证。通商产业省说，这种措施是为了使日本政府能够加强限制这些商品输往美国。
    新西兰政府
    华盛顿消息：新西兰驻美国大使孟罗在十八日给美国国务院的一份照会中，抗议美国在国外倾销奶制品。
    照会说，这种做法损害了新西兰的出口市场。照会要求美国修改它的奶制品处理计划，停止倾销和出口补贴制度。　　（据新华社讯）
