    The National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union, initiated by prominent figures from Japanese political, economic, cultural, and many mass organizations, was held in Tokyo from November 28th to 29th. The convention adopted a declaration announcing the launch of a large-scale national movement to urge the Japanese government to take swift measures to resolve the Japan-Soviet negotiations as soon as possible, and to hold talks with China to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The convention also adopted ten resolutions on restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union, and promoting friendly relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and also passed a suggestion to convene another convention in March of next year to strive for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union.

    The holding of the National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union is another significant effort by the Japanese people to establish good neighborly and friendly relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and to promote mutual economic and cultural exchanges. The Chinese people express warm welcome and support for this effort by the Japanese people.

    The National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union is being held at this time, which is of great significance. The international situation after the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference shows that although some people still want to intensify the "Cold War," the further easing of the situation cannot be stopped. The desire of the people of the world for peace and for the easing of the international situation has formed such a powerful force that the advocates of "power politics" cannot but have some concerns. In Asia, more and more countries are pursuing independent and autonomous policies. They are opening up infinitely broad prospects for their economic and cultural development in peaceful coexistence with all countries, and are making valuable contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    This situation cannot but cause all insightful Japanese people to think deeply. As an Asian country, which path will Japan take? Will it join hands with the Asian people and move forward on the road of striving for peace and common prosperity and development? Or will it take the road of confrontation with the Asian people, follow foreign war policies, and thus, as former Japanese Lieutenant General Saburo Endo pointed out, make itself an "orphan of the Orient and a laggard in the world"?

    The choice of the Japanese people is very clear. Although certain forces in Japan are trying their best to drag the Japanese people onto the road of being hostile to the Asian people, the broad masses of the Japanese people resolutely demand to take the road of friendship with the people of all Asian countries, and the first thing to do is to restore friendly relations with China and the Soviet Union. The holding of the National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union is a strong expression of this choice made by the Japanese people.

    China and the Soviet Union are Japan's close neighbors. China and the Soviet Union have always pursued a peaceful foreign policy and are willing to coexist peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner with all Asian and other countries on the basis of the Five Principles. Therefore, the relationship between Japan and China and the Soviet Union is a sign of whether Japan is willing to coexist peacefully with other countries in the Asian family. At present, Japan has not yet restored normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, and the state of war still exists. Whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for Japan to be able to play its active role in Asia, this situation should no longer continue. The Japanese people are obviously fully aware of this.

    Moreover, as pointed out in the declaration of the National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, once diplomatic relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union are restored, various issues such as war criminals, fisheries, trade, and cultural exchanges can be resolved, and everyone knows how much benefit the resolution of these issues will bring to the Japanese people.

    The people and governments of China and the Soviet Union have made and are still making many efforts to promote the normalization of relations with Japan. The active and patient attitude adopted by the Soviet Union in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations is visible to everyone. As far as the relations between China and Japan are concerned, thanks to the efforts of the people of China and Japan and the assistance of the Chinese government, considerable progress has been made in terms of overseas Chinese, fisheries, trade, cultural exchanges, and mutual visits between the people of the two countries. However, since diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been restored, all these issues can only be resolved at the level of non-governmental organizations, and their implementation is often hindered. Therefore, conducting diplomatic negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries is an important key to further solving the existing problems between the two countries. The National Convention for Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union demands that the Japanese government and the Chinese government hold talks to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, which is completely in line with the wishes and interests of the people of China and Japan.

    Now, the key to the normalization of relations between China and Japan and between the Soviet Union and Japan lies entirely with the Japanese government. In the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the Japanese government went back on its promises to the Japanese people and delayed the negotiations by putting forward unreasonable preconditions, so that the negotiations have not yielded any results so far. On November 30, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said on the one hand that Japan was willing to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union as a prerequisite for restoring normal relations between the two countries, but on the other hand, he regarded the solution of the so-called "territorial" issue as a prerequisite for concluding a peace treaty. This makes it difficult for people to believe that Mamoru Shigemitsu really wants to restore normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and really wants to end the state of war between the two countries.

    On the issue of restoring normal relations between China and Japan, the Japanese government has also adopted a negative attitude. Despite the many efforts made by the Chinese side and Japanese people's organizations to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Japanese government has shown no positive response. Not only that, the Japanese government also wants to restrict the exchanges between non-governmental organizations of China and Japan, creating obstacles to the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan. According to Japan's "Industrial Affairs Evening News," Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu told Prime Minister Hatoyama that he believed that the activities carried out by Japanese non-governmental organizations in China were "improper" when relations between China and Japan had not yet normalized. He was very dissatisfied with the recent agreements reached between the Japanese trade union delegation and the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution and the corresponding Chinese non-governmental organizations on friendly unity and cultural exchanges between the workers of the two countries. He believes that restricting such civilian groups from coming to China is "unavoidable." This shows that certain forces in Japan are still trying to disregard the wishes of the Japanese people and stubbornly obstruct the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

    Due to the Japanese government's negative attitude, the Japanese people's efforts to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China still have to overcome various obstacles. However, the recent political situation in Japan shows that it has become increasingly difficult for the Japanese government to ignore the will of the Japanese people. The restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only the wish of the Japanese people, but also determined by the trend of historical development. The torrent of history will mercilessly wash away those who try to reverse the trend of historical development. The Japanese people's efforts to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China will surely be victorious.

### 日本人民促进恢复日苏日中邦交的重大努力

    日本人民促进恢复日苏日中邦交的重大努力
    十一月二十八日到二十九日，在东京举行了由日本政界、经济界、文化界和许多群众团体著名人士发起的日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会。大会通过了宣言，宣布将要展开一个大规模的国民运动，以促使日本政府迅速采取措施早日解决日苏谈判，同时同中国举行会谈以促进日中邦交的正常化。大会还通过了有关恢复日中、日苏邦交和促进日本同中国、苏联之间的友好关系的十项决议，并且通过了在明年三月再召开一次争取日中、日苏邦交正常化的大会的建议。
    日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会的举行，是日本人民为了建立日本同中国、苏联之间的睦邻友好关系、促进相互的经济和文化的交流而作的又一个重大的努力。中国人民对于日本人民这种努力表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会在目前这个时候举行，是有着重大的意义的。四国外长会议以后的国际局势表明，尽管仍然有人想加剧“冷战”，但是，局势的进一步和缓是阻挡不住的。全世界人民对于和平、对于和缓国际局势的愿望，已经形成了这样强大的力量，使得那些“实力政策”的鼓吹者不能不有所顾忌。在亚洲，越来越多的国家奉行独立自主的政策，它们在同一切国家和平共处中为自己的经济上和文化上的发展开辟了无限远大的前途，并且对维护亚洲和世界和平的事业作出了有价值的贡献。
    这种情势不能不引起一切有见识的日本人士的深思。作为一个亚洲国家，日本将走哪一条道路呢？它将和亚洲人民一起，在争取和平、争取共同的繁荣和发展的道路上携手前进呢？还是走和亚洲人民对立的道路，追随外国的战争政策，从而像日本的前陆军中将远藤三郎所指出的，使自己成为“东洋的孤儿和世界的落伍者”呢？
    日本人民的抉择是很清楚的。虽然日本的某些势力竭力想把日本人民拖上同亚洲人民为敌的道路，但是广大日本人民却坚决要求走同亚洲各国人民友好的道路，首先就是要同中国、苏联恢复友好的关系。日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会的举行，正是日本人民所作的这个抉择的强烈表现。
    中国和苏联都是日本的紧邻。中国和苏联一贯奉行和平的外交政策，愿意在五项原则的基础上同所有亚洲和其他国家和平共处，友好合作，因此，日本同中国、苏联的关系如何，就是日本是否愿意在亚洲大家庭中同其他国家和平共处的标志。日本目前同中国和苏联之间还没有恢复正常关系，战争状态依然存在。无论是为了远东和平的利益或者是为了使日本能够在亚洲发挥它的积极作用，这种情形再也不应该继续存在下去了。日本人民显然是充分认识到这一点的。
    而且，正如日本促进恢复日苏、日中邦交全国大会的宣言所指出的，日中、日苏邦交一旦恢复，关于战犯、渔业、贸易和文化交流等各种问题就可以得到解决，而这些问题的解决将会给日本人民带来多么大的好处，这是任何人都知道的事情。
    中苏两国人民和两国政府为了促进同日本的关系的正常化，曾经作了并且还在作着多方面的努力。苏联在苏日谈判中所采取的积极的和耐心的态度，是大家都见到的。就中日两国的关系来说，由于中日两国人民的努力和中国政府的协助，在侨民、渔业、贸易、文化交流、两国人民互相访问等方面已经作出了不少成绩。但是由于中日邦交没有恢复，所有这些问题只能在民间团体的水平上解决，而且在执行上还常常受到阻挠。所以，在中日两国政府之间进行外交上的谈判，促进两国关系正常化，是进一步解决两国之间存在的各项问题的重要关键。日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会要求日本政府和中国政府举行会谈以促进日中邦交的正常化，这是完全符合于中日两国人民的愿望和利益的。
    现在，中日、苏日关系正常化的关键完全在于日本政府。日本政府在苏日谈判中背弃它曾经向日本人民提出过的诺言，用提出无理的先决条件来拖延谈判，使得谈判至今毫无结果。在十一月三十日日本外务相重光葵一方面说，日本愿意以同苏联缔结和约作为恢复两国正常关系的先决条件，但是另一方面他又以解决所谓“领土”问题作为缔结和约的先决条件。这就很难使人相信重光葵真想恢复日苏之间的正常关系，真想结束两国之间的战争状态。
    在恢复中日正常关系的问题上，日本政府也采取了消极态度。尽管中国方面和日本人民团体为了促进两国邦交的恢复作了多方面的努力，日本政府却毫无积极的反应。不但如此，日本政府还想限制中日两国民间团体的往来，为中日两国人民的友好合作制造障碍。据日本的“产业时事晚报”透露，日本外务相重光葵向鸠山首相表示，他认为在中日关系还没有正常化的时候，日本民间团体在中国进行的活动是“不正当的”。他对于最近日本工会代表团和日本拥护宪法国民联合会同中国的相应民间团体最近达成的有关两国工人之间的友好团结和文化交流方面的协议十分不满。他认为限制这种平民团体到中国来是“不可避免的”。这就说明日本的某些势力仍然企图无视日本人民的愿望，顽固地阻挠中日两国邦交的恢复。
    由于日本政府的这种消极态度，日本人民争取恢复日苏、日中邦交的努力还须克服种种障碍。但是日本最近的政治局势表明，日本政府要想无视日本人民的意志，已经越来越困难了。日中、日苏邦交的恢复，不仅是日本人民的愿望，也是历史发展的趋向所决定了的。历史的潮流将要无情地冲走那些妄想扭转历史发展趋向的人。日本人民争取恢复日苏、日中邦交的努力将一定得到胜利。
