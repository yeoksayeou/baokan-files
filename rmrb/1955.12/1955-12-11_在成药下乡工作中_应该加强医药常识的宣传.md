    In the work of distributing manufactured drugs to the countryside,
    the popularization of medical common sense should be strengthened
    To the Editor:
    At present, when rural medical and health institutions still cannot meet the needs of the people, it is very necessary to actively carry out the work of distributing manufactured drugs to the countryside. However, due to the lack of medical common sense of some staff members of the sales units and patients, some incidents of patients taking the wrong medicine have occurred. For example, in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, someone bought Santonin tablets for their child to get rid of roundworms. Because the salesperson did not explain the dosage, the child took thirty tablets of 0.03 gram Santonin at one time, resulting in poisoning and death. A resident of Huzhou City who had a cough bought "Leimifeng" from a department store and took it (note: "Leimifeng" should not be used indiscriminately without a doctor's diagnosis); another farmer took too much quinine and became deaf. There are many similar situations, which should be taken seriously by the health department.
    In order to ensure the life and health of the people, I hope that pharmaceutical companies should attach detailed and easy-to-understand instructions to the supplied manufactured drugs, indicating the properties of the drug, the diseases it treats, the dosage and method of administration. Sales units should determine the variety and scope of manufactured drugs sold according to their own business capabilities; in the initial stage of operation, the variety should generally not be too many. In addition, pharmaceutical companies in various places, if possible, should organize short-term training in basic medical common sense for employees of sales units, or send experienced staff to assist department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives that sell manufactured drugs in doing a good job in supplying manufactured drugs.

### 在成药下乡工作中  应该加强医药常识的宣传

    在成药下乡工作中
    应该加强医药常识的宣传编辑同志：
    在目前农村医疗卫生机构还不能满足人民需要的情况下，积极开展成药下乡工作是很必要的。但是，由于某些经销单位的工作人员和患病人缺乏医药常识，以致发生了一些病人吃错药的事件。例如，浙江兰溪县有一个人买了山道年片给小孩打蛔虫，因为卖药的营业员没有说明服法，这个小孩一次竟服了○、○三公分山道年片三十片，结果中毒死亡。湖州市有一个居民患咳嗽，就从百货商店买了“雷米风”（按“雷米风”，非医生诊断不得乱用）服用；还有一个农民吃奎宁吃得太多了，就发生了耳聋的现象。类似这种情况的还很多，应该引起卫生部门的严重注意。
    为了保证人民的生命健康，我希望医药公司应该在供应的成药中附有详细而又通俗的说明书，标明药品性能、主治疾病、用量和服法。经销单位应该根据自己的经营能力，确定经售成药的品种和范围；在初经营的时候，品种一般不宜太多。此外，各地医药公司在可能的条件下，最好能够组织经销单位的从业人员进行基本医药常识的短期学习，或者抽派业务熟练的工作人员巡回协助各经销成药的百货商店和供销合作社做好成药供应工作。
