Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. A memorial concert for the 20th anniversary of Nie Er's death and the 10th anniversary of Xian Xinghai's death was held at the Capital Theater in Beijing on the evening of the 5th.

The memorial concert was held by the Ministry of Culture, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Musicians Association to commemorate Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and also to better inherit and carry forward the socialist realist musical tradition that they laid down and consolidated. The program of the concert consisted entirely of works by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, performed by more than 400 musicians and music lovers from the Central Experimental Opera House, the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Orchestra of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the Children's Broadcasting Chorus of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the Orchestra of the Central Newsreel Film Studio.

The "National Anthem," composed by Nie Er, was sung at the concert, and the third movement of the "National Liberation Symphony," composed by Xian Xinghai, was performed.

Among the songs composed by Nie Er that the singers sang were "Graduation Song," "Marching Song," "Dock Workers' Song," and "The Road Song." Nie Er created these songs after he joined the Chinese Communist Party, which was also the period when he created the most and was the most mature. Among the songs composed by Xian Xinghai that the singers sang were "On the Taihang Mountains," "Go to the Enemy's Rear," and "Guerrilla Army," three songs depicting guerrilla warfare. Xian Xinghai created these songs during the period when the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare led by the Chinese Communist Party was widely carried out behind enemy lines. At that time, the guerrillas on the Taihang Mountains regarded "On the Taihang Mountains" as their team song.

The last program, "Yellow River Cantata," was conducted by Shi Lemeng, a student of Xian Xinghai.

The concert was a great success. The audience gave the most enthusiastic applause to every program. Many programs were re-performed at the request of the audience.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Acting Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, Vice Minister Chen Kehan, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Chen Yi, Deputy Director Li Zhaobing, and more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the capital and international friends in Beijing attended the concert tonight.

The concert will continue.
