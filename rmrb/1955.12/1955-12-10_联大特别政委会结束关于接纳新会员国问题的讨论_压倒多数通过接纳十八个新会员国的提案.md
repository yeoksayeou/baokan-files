    Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch via TASS—The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee concluded its discussion on the question of admitting new member states on the 7th. The committee passed a proposal submitted by twenty-eight countries, including Canada, to simultaneously admit eighteen countries to the United Nations.

    During the committee's morning and afternoon sessions on December 6, representatives from many countries, including the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Norway, El Salvador, Indonesia, Panama, Thailand, Afghanistan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Guatemala, Yemen, Ethiopia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Honduras, and Costa Rica, spoke in support of the twenty-eight-nation proposal.

    At the morning session on the 7th, the statement by the United States representative, Lodge, indicated that the United States intended to obstruct the admission of eighteen countries to the United Nations. Lodge insisted on admitting only those countries favored by the United States and did not support the participation of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Romania in the United Nations. He attacked these countries.

    Lodge said that the United States had no intention of exercising its "veto" when the Security Council voted on the issue of admitting these countries, but it would abstain. This statement showed that the United States was still unwilling to abandon its long-standing tactic: using abstentions in the Security Council to prevent applicant countries from obtaining the necessary votes.

    Soviet representative Malik spoke in support of the twenty-eight-nation proposal. He said that the experience of reviewing the issue of admitting new member states in the Security Council for many years shows that abstaining from voting—if a group abstains and it is for some political purpose—is equivalent to voting against the decision to admit a certain country.

    Indian representative Menon emphasized in his speech that continuing to exclude vast areas of the world from the United Nations is fraught with danger to world peace. Menon also pointed out that the arguments of some representatives against the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic were untenable.

    After hearing this part of Menon's speech, Lodge impulsively left the meeting hall.

    At the afternoon session on the 7th, French representative Hoppenot stated that his country supports the principle of the universality of the United Nations, but his delegation would abstain because it "has reservations about admitting some of the eighteen countries." Canadian representative Martin stated in his speech that all conditions were in place for the smooth resolution of the issue of increasing United Nations membership.

    The committee finally passed the twenty-eight-nation proposal with an overwhelming majority of fifty-two votes. The Cuban delegation and the Chiang Kai-shek elements voted against it. The United States, France, Belgium, Greece, and Israel abstained.

    The Special Political Committee's resolution will be reviewed at the General Assembly plenary session on December 8 and then submitted to the Security Council for consideration.

    联大特别政委会结束关于接纳新会员国问题的讨论
    压倒多数通过接纳十八个新会员国的提案
    新华社　据塔斯社纽约讯联合国大会特别政治委员会关于接纳新会员国问题的讨论已经在七日结束。委员会通过了加拿大等二十八个国家提出的同时接纳十八个国家加入联合国的提案。
    在委员会六日上午和下午会议上，白俄罗斯共和国、挪威、萨尔瓦多、印度尼西亚、巴拿马、泰国、阿富汗、利比里亚、沙特阿拉伯、危地马拉、也门、埃塞俄比亚、厄瓜多尔、乌拉圭、洪都拉斯和哥斯达黎加等许多国家的代表发言支持二十八国提案。
    在七日上午会议上，美国代表洛奇的发言表明美国打算阻挠接纳十八个国家参加联合国。洛奇坚持只接纳美国中意的一些国家，而不支持阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、蒙古人民共和国和罗马尼亚参加联合国。他对这些国家进行了攻击。
    洛奇说，美国无意在安全理事会就接纳这些国家的问题进行表决的时候行使“否决权”，但是它要弃权。这种发言显示美国仍然不愿意放弃它长时期以来一贯的手法：用弃权的办法在安全理事会使申请国得不到必要的票数。
    苏联代表马立克发言表示支持二十八个国家的提案。他说，许多年来在安全理事会中审查接纳新会员国问题的经验表明：投票的时候弃权——如果是一个集团实行弃权而且是为了某种政治目的的话——就等于在决定接纳某一个国家的问题的时候投反对票。
    印度代表梅农在发言中强调指出，继续把世界上的广大地区排斥在联合国之外，对于世界和平是充满危险的。梅农并且指出了某些代表反对接纳蒙古人民共和国的论据不能成立。
    洛奇在听了梅农的这部分发言以后，感情冲动地离开了会议厅。
    在七日下午会议上，法国代表奥登诺表示，他的国家赞成联合国普遍性的原则，但是他的代表团将弃权，因为它“对接纳十八个国家中的某些国家有保留”。加拿大代表马丁在发言中认为有一切条件来顺利解决增加联合国会员的问题。
    委员会最后以五十二票的压倒多数通过了二十八国提案。古巴代表团和蒋介石分子投反对票。美国、法国、比利时、希腊和以色列弃权。
    特别政治委员会的决议将在十二月八日在大会全体会议上审查，然后提交安全理事会考虑。
