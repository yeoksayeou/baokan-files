Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 15th: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, continued its visit in Shanghai on the 15th.

    In the morning, the delegation visited the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store. This store sells more than 15,000 kinds of goods and receives 100,000 to 150,000 customers every day, making it the largest department store in Shanghai. Prime Minister Grotewohl and others inquired about the store's business operations and employee welfare from the store manager, and purchased some of their favorite goods here.
    After leaving the department store, Prime Minister Grotewohl and others went to the bustling Nanjing East Road. Before liberation, this area was a concentration of imperialist and bureaucratic capitalist enterprises; now, many of the tall buildings here have become the people's own economic organs and enterprises. As soon as Prime Minister Grotewohl appeared on the street, he was immediately surrounded by the masses. People repeatedly applauded Prime Minister Grotewohl to express their welcome. When Prime Minister Grotewohl and others left, the enthusiastic masses tightly surrounded the cars, applauding and cheering goodbye.
    Subsequently, the distinguished guests took the yacht "Gang Shen" at the Outer Hongqiao Wharf, toured the Huangpu River, and landed at Wusongkou for a visit.
    In the evening, the distinguished guests attended a Yue Opera performance, watching the Chinese classical drama "Romance of the West Chamber" performed by the famous actors Yuan Xuefen, Xu Yulan, and Lü Ruiying, who had recently visited Germany. After the performance, Prime Minister Grotewohl and his wife went on stage to present flower baskets to the actors and warmly shook hands with Yuan Xuefen and others to express their gratitude.
    Six members of the delegation, including Dr. Tepletz, State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, left Shanghai by plane this morning for a visit to Wuhan.

    民主德国政府代表团继续在上海参观
    据新华社上海十五日电　以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，十五日继续在上海进行参观。
    上午，代表团参观了国营上海市第一百货商店。这里，经售一万五千多种商品，每天接待十万到十五万名顾客，是上海最大的百货商店。格罗提渥总理等向商店经理询问了这个商店的营业情况和职工福利情况，并且在这里选购了一部分他们所喜爱的商品。
    离开百货商店以后，格罗提渥总理等又前往繁华的南京东路。解放以前，这一带曾经是帝国主义和官僚资本主义企业的集中地；现在，这里的许多高楼大厦已经成为人民自己的经济机关和企业。格罗提渥总理刚一出现在街头，立刻就被群众包围起来。人们一再向格罗提渥总理鼓掌表示欢迎。格罗提渥总理等离开时，热情的群众还紧紧地围在汽车两旁，夹道鼓掌欢送。
    随后，贵宾们在外虹桥码头乘游艇“港申”号，游览了黄浦江，并且在吴淞口登岸参观。
    晚上，贵宾们出席了越剧晚会，观看了不久前访问过德国的著名演员袁雪芬、徐玉兰、吕瑞英演出的中国古典剧“西厢记”。演出结束以后，格罗提渥总理和夫人等登上舞台，向演员们赠送花篮，并同袁雪芬等亲切握手致谢。
    代表团团员、司法部国务秘书特普利茨博士等六人已经在今天上午乘飞机离开上海去武汉访问。
