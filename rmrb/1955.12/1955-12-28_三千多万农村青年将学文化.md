Xinhua News Agency Report:

    So far, youth league organizations in 25 provinces and cities across the country have drafted plans to eliminate illiteracy among rural youths. According to the plan, 32 million illiterate rural youths will enroll in schools this winter, approximately double the number of rural illiterate youths who enrolled last winter. By the autumn of next year, nearly 5 million rural youths may be freed from illiteracy, approximately two and a half times more than last year. Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities require that rural youth illiteracy be eliminated by 1957, and the latest provinces, such as Qinghai, Jiangxi, and Guizhou, will complete this task by 1962.
    Youth league organizations in various regions are actively assisting education administrative departments in carrying out literacy work. The Hongzhao County Committee of the Youth League in Shanxi Province organized more than 1,800 students from three middle schools to go to the countryside. In just over a day, they helped farmers compile 467 "work point literacy textbooks." Shandong, Gansu, Hunan, Beijing, and other provinces and cities have organized youth literacy teams. The Wendeng Prefecture of Shandong Province established youth literacy teams in more than 1,000 townships and 4,400 villages, with more than 100,000 rural educated youths participating. These youth literacy teams have also formulated plans to eliminate illiteracy in their respective townships and villages on a regular basis.

    三千多万农村青年将学文化
    到目前为止，全国已经有二十五个省、市的青年团组织拟出了扫除农村青年文盲的规划。按照规划，全国今冬将有三千二百万农村青年文盲入学，比去年冬季青年文盲入学人数约增加一倍；到明年秋季可以有近五百万的农村青年脱离文盲状态，比去年约增加两倍半。北京、上海等市要求到一九五七年扫除农村的青年文盲，最迟的青海、江西、贵州等省，到一九六二年也要完成这一工作。
    各地的青年团组织积极协助教育行政部门开展扫盲工作。青年团山西省洪赵县委员会组织了三个中学的一千八百多名学生下乡，在一天多的时间里帮助农民编了四百六十七本“记工识字课本”。山东、甘肃、湖南、北京等省、市组织了青年扫盲队。山东省文登专区在一千多个乡和四千四百多个村里建立了青年扫盲队，有十万多名农村知识青年参加。这些青年扫盲队还订出了定期扫除本乡、村的文盲的计划。  （据新华社讯）
