    Strive to fulfill this year's basic construction and production plan for the coal industry and prepare for next year's work
    Wang Jinlin, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Coal Industry
    The basic construction and production plan targets for the coal industry in 1955 have increased significantly compared to 1954. In terms of basic construction, the total investment for the year increased by 35.3 percent compared to 1954. A total of 57 new, restored, and renovated mines were built, with a designed capacity of more than 15 million tons. More than 30 new mines were put into production throughout the year, including the modern large-scale vertical shafts of Hegang Dongshan and Liaoyuan Central, designed with Soviet assistance. In order to ensure the needs of industrial coal, especially coking coal, the construction of new coal mine bases such as Pingdingshan, Yitang, and Shiguaizi was also started. In terms of production, the planned total output value for this year increased by 17 percent compared to 1954, raw coal production increased by 17.5 percent, costs reduced by 4.81 percent, and labor productivity increased by 5.77 percent. Fulfilling this year's basic construction and production plan for the coal industry is of utmost importance for meeting the needs of the national economy and successfully completing the coal industry's First Five-Year Plan.

    The entire staff of the coal industry sector has made arduous efforts to achieve this plan. In terms of basic construction, design personnel have improved their ideological level through studying the state's construction guidelines, policies, and technical aspects, and have begun to implement classified design and standard design, accelerating the design progress and improving the design quality. The basic construction force has grown to more than 120,000 people to date, establishing ten regional basic construction bureaus, more than fifty engineering offices, and three engineering companies, which has enabled us to carry out construction simultaneously in more than one hundred construction units this year. There have also been improvements in construction management. Construction organization designs are generally compiled before the start of new mines, and the scheduling work at all levels has been strengthened, which has changed the chaotic phenomenon of construction management to varying degrees, reduced waste, and improved quality. As of the end of October, 66.8 percent of the annual basic construction plan had been completed.

    In terms of production, after implementing the policy of comprehensive production reform last year, a general assessment of the production capacity of each mine was carried out, and specific measures and plans were proposed for each weak link. Several important production management systems have been initially established in production management work. For example, more than 70 percent of bureaus and mines nationwide have established a leadership cadre duty system. Through organizing work meetings and having mine managers and chief engineers take turns on duty, timely guidance of production and resolution of problems occurring in production are achieved. While improving the leadership of bureaus and mines, the leadership over the grassroots level has been strengthened, and regular cyclic operation has been vigorously promoted. In 1955, many mines focused on selecting nearly one hundred working faces to promote the advanced experience of Fuxin Ping'an Mine's one-meter layer coal mining team in organizing regular cyclic operation. Units that have promoted this well have improved efficiency, reduced costs, and eliminated or reduced serious injuries and fatalities. Before August, working faces nationwide that achieved more than twenty-five cycles per month accounted for only 20 percent of all working faces, but this increased to 24 to 26 percent in September.

    In order to smoothly promote regular cyclic operation and improve production efficiency, each mining bureau has rectified its labor organization, appropriately streamlined management agencies, and strengthened the grassroots level, making the labor organization more rational. The wage quotas and labor quotas have also been revised, so that labor productivity is expected to increase by 5.77 percent compared to 1954. After the Fushun Laohutai Mine's transportation area rectified its labor organization in August, streamlining personnel by 15.2 percent and supplementing the coal mining working faces lacking workers, it is estimated that more than 30,000 tons of raw coal can be additionally produced from September to December, and efficiency can be improved by 46.1 percent. The Beipiao Guanshan No. 1 mine roadway team originally had forty-seven people, but after starting rectification in late August, it was reduced to twenty-eight people. The reduced manpower was directly invested in production, which can increase the country's raw coal production by more than 20,000 tons per year.

    In terms of technical management, the focus has been on strengthening geological surveying work. Major coal mines across the country have generally established geological surveying work organizations. Most coal mines have collected, sorted out, and reviewed existing geological data, and compiled geological reports for production mines. Some units have already implemented the geological description system for coal extraction and tunneling working faces, thereby strengthening the guiding role of geological surveying work in production and initially reversing some unreasonable mining procedures. For example, units such as Jiaohe, Beipiao, Jixi, Benxi, Hegang, and Shuangya have all stopped the unreasonable practice of mining the lower coal seam first, which affects the mining of the upper coal seam, protecting national resources. At the same time, many minable coal seams have been discovered, extending the life of the mines. Another major task in technical management is to improve equipment utilization. The mechanization of coal mining nationwide has increased from 33.6 percent in 1954 to the current 41.15 percent. Precisely because a series of measures have been taken, raw coal production has exceeded the state plan by more than 400,000 tons as of the end of October, and it is estimated that it can exceed the plan by 1.2 million tons by the end of the year. The serious situation of cost overruns in the first half of the year has also gradually improved, and it is estimated that costs can be reduced by more than 7 million yuan by the end of the year.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that after the central government put forward the call for practicing strict economy and opposing waste, we have regarded increasing production and practicing economy as a regular economic and political task for all employees in the coal industry. We have focused on opposing various erroneous ideas such as a lack of economic perspective, neglecting economic accounting, not strictly implementing the economy system, and not attaching importance to conservation, reducing the investment in non-productive construction by more than 7 million yuan, and increasing some new construction projects, starting projects that could be started in advance. In order to reduce project costs, the methods of using local materials and saving steel have been widely adopted. We originally planned to save 55,900 yuan in basic construction. As of the end of September, 50,258 yuan had been completed. It is expected that the four regional management bureaus of Taiyuan, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Xi'an can overfulfill the savings plan. The production sector can not only ensure that the overruns in the first half of the year are made up, but also overfulfill the state's requirement to reduce costs by 1.5 percent.

    Although we have achieved the above results, judging from the current situation, it is still necessary to overcome many difficulties in order to fully complete this year's basic construction and production plans, especially the basic construction plan. We must fully recognize these difficulties, actively take measures, and strive to fully complete this year's plan, and prepare for next year's work.

    All basic construction units and construction units must strengthen the leadership of the construction site, grasp the scheduling work, communicate up and down, and solve problems in a timely manner. Under the premise of ensuring quality and safety, strive to complete this year's plan. At the same time, for the main projects that can be overfulfilled, they should be completed as early as possible. On the one hand, the workload for this year is increased, and the construction speed is accelerated. On the other hand, it can also reduce idleness and waste. In 1956, thirty-nine new mines will be started nationwide, and thirty-eight mines will be continued, six mines will be renovated, and three mines will be restored. These projects must be prepared this year to ensure that half of the new mines will be started in the first half of next year. Otherwise, there is a risk that the basic construction tasks for next year and the First Five-Year Plan will not be completed. The main problems in current coal mine basic construction are still that geology cannot keep up with design, and design cannot keep up with construction. Recently, we have studied the specific situation and characteristics of coal mine construction, and are prepared to quickly submit the basic data necessary for design in areas with simple geological structures, stable or semi-stable coal seams, after the drilling work is completed or basically completed, so as to carry out design based on it. After the geological report is approved, the design department should quickly submit the drawings necessary for construction preparation work, so as to carry out construction preparation as early as possible. For mines with an annual output of less than 600,000 tons, construction should be organized in a timely manner after the preliminary design is approved. In this way, the entire preparation time can be shortened by two or three months. In addition to actively completing this year's basic construction tasks, basic construction units should immediately organize forces to conduct a balanced assessment of next year's projects, especially new mines, and strive to start new mines in advance. For the work in the first quarter of next year, special personnel should be designated to be responsible for preparing for the construction of new mines starting in the first quarter and cross-year projects, so as to ensure that at least 20 percent of the total task for the next year is completed in the first quarter. In addition, the supply of equipment and materials, the allocation of labor, and issues such as power supply and railway transportation should also be grasped and resolved in a timely manner, so as not to affect construction due to the delay in resolving these issues.

    Although the implementation of this year's production plan is relatively good, the phenomenon of rushing to catch up at the end of the year is still quite common. Tunneling cannot keep up with the needs of coal extraction, and the geological and surveying work of mines cannot keep up with the needs of tunneling. The safety situation is also not good. The planned output for 1956 will increase by about 11.95 percent compared to 1955. If enterprise management is not further improved and the situation of uneven plan implementation is not improved, it will inevitably affect the comprehensive completion of the plan. The lagging of tunneling behind the needs of coal extraction is an old problem that has not been completely solved so far. This is mainly because the geological surveying work is backward, and geological descriptions cannot be provided for tunneling working faces, which cannot play a supervisory and guiding role in tunneling and coal extraction, making the basis for the arrangement of roadways insufficient. Due to the lag in tunneling work, it seriously affects balanced production. Therefore, this year, under the premise of completing the planned output, each mining bureau should strengthen mine geological and surveying work, rationally arrange roadways, effectively strengthen tunneling work, eliminate invalid footage and stagnant coal volume in tunneling work, and ensure that there are sufficient preparation working faces and coal volume, according to the decision of the recent Second National Coal Mine Geological Work Conference. From January to September this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau had 1,848 meters of invalid footage, and the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau also had more than 2,000 meters of invalid footage. The stagnant coal volume of the Huainan Mining Bureau accounted for about 25 percent of the total coal volume obtained in the first half of the year, and other mining bureaus also had similar situations. This unreasonable phenomenon must be completely changed. In order to ensure the balance of coal extraction and tunneling work, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work, establish a special agency in charge of tunneling, set up tunneling areas, designate a special engineer to be responsible, organize tunneling work and regular cyclic operation, improve the degree of mechanization, and improve the utilization rate of tunneling machinery. The use of tunneling machinery this year is not good enough. From January to August, the degree of mechanization of coal loading in tunneling nationwide was only 9.38 percent. The number of coal loading machines and rock loading machines for tunneling nationwide is not large, and less than half of them are used, which greatly affects the progress of tunneling. This situation must be changed with the greatest determination. At the same time, in completing this year's production plan, preparations for next year must be made. Mines that have the conditions to start repairs ahead of schedule must immediately formulate a repair plan and prepare spare parts. Large equipment that urgently needs repair and requires a long time to repair should be repaired in advance, especially.

    It must be admitted that it is difficult to fully complete this year's basic construction and production plans. However, as long as we fully recognize these difficulties, closely rely on the Party, rely on all employees and engineering and technical personnel, and actively create conditions to overcome difficulties, it is possible to fully complete this year's plan and make various preparations to lay a solid foundation for completing the 1956 plan and the First Five-Year Plan.

    为完成今年煤炭工业的基本建设和生产计划、做好明年的准备工作而努力
    煤炭工业部办公厅副主任  王金林
    一九五五年煤炭工业的基本建设和生产计划指标，比一九五四年都有很大的增长。在基本建设方面，全年投资额较一九五四年增加百分之三十五点三，新建、恢复和改建的矿井共五十七处，设计能力共一千五百多万吨，全年投入生产的新矿井有三十多处，其中包括苏联帮助我国设计的现代化的鹤岗东山和辽源中央等大型竖井；为了保证工业用煤特别是炼焦用煤的需要，还开始了平顶山、义棠、石拐子等新的煤矿基地的建设。在生产方面，今年计划生产总值较一九五四年增长百分之十七，原煤产量增长百分之十七点五，成本降低百分之四点八一，劳动生产率提高百分之五点七七。完成今年煤炭工业的基本建设和生产计划，对满足国民经济的需要，顺利地完成煤炭工业的第一个五年计划，有极其重要的意义。
    煤炭工业部门的全体职工为实现这个计划作了艰巨的努力。在基本建设方面，设计人员经过对国家的建设方针、政策和技术方面的学习，思想水平有所提高，开始推行了分类设计、标准设计，加快了设计进度，提高了设计质量。基本建设的施工力量到目前为止已经发展到十二万多人，建立了十个地区基本建设局、五十多个工程处和三个工程公司，这就使我们今年有可能在一百多个建设单位同时进行施工。施工管理工作也有了改进，新建矿井在开工前一般都编制了施工组织设计，加强了各级的调度工作，在不同程度上改变了施工管理工作的混乱现象，减少了浪费，提高了质量。截至十月底止，全年基本建设计划已完成百分之六十六点八。
    在生产方面，去年在贯彻执行全面生产改革的方针下，对各矿的生产能力普遍进行了摸底，针对各个薄弱环节提出了具体措施计划。在生产管理工作中初步建立了几项重要的生产管理制度，如全国已有百分之七十以上的局、矿建立了领导干部值班制，通过组织作业会议，矿长、总工程师轮流值班，做到及时指导生产和解决生产中发生的问题。在改进局、矿领导的同时，加强了对基层的领导，大力推行正规循环作业，一九五五年在不少的矿曾重点地选择了近一百个工作面，推广阜新平安矿一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验。凡是推广得好的单位，都提高了效率，降低了成本，消灭或减少了重伤和死亡事故。八月份以前全国每月做到二十五个循环以上的工作面只占全部工作面的百分之二十，到九月份则提高到百分之二十四到百分之二十六。
    为了顺利推行正规循环作业和提高生产效率，各矿务局整顿了劳动组织，适当精简了管理机构，充实了基层，使劳动组织更加合理；并且修改了工资定额和劳动定额，使劳动生产率比一九五四年预计提高百分之五点七七。抚顺老虎台矿运输区八月份经过整顿劳动组织，精简人员百分之十五点二，充实了缺少工人的采煤工作面，九至十二月预计可增产三万多吨原煤，效率可提高百分之四十六点一。北票冠山一坑车道班原有四十七人，八月下旬开始整顿，减到二十八人，减下的人力直接投入生产，每年可为国家增产原煤二万吨以上。
    在技术管理方面，主要是加强了地质测量工作。全国各大煤矿已经普遍地建立起地质测量工作机构，大部分煤矿搜集、整理和审查了现有的地质资料，编制了生产矿井地质报告。有一些单位已经执行了回采、掘进工作面地质说明书制度，从而加强了地质测量工作对生产的指导作用，初步扭转了某些不合理的开采程序。如蛟河、北票、鸡西、本溪、鹤岗、双鸭等单位今年都停止了先采下层煤影响上层煤开采的不合理做法，保护了国家资源。同时还发现了不少可采煤层，延长了矿井寿命。技术管理方面另一个主要工作是提高了设备利用率。全国采煤机械化已经由一九五四年的百分之三十三点六，提高到目前的百分之四十一点一五。正由于采取了这一系列的措施，截至十月底止，原煤产量除完成国家计划外已经超额生产四十多万吨，预计到年底可超额生产一百二十万吨。上半年成本超支的严重局面，也逐步有了好转，预计到年底可降低成本七百多万元。
    特别值得提出的是中央提出厉行节约，反对浪费的号召以后，我们曾把增产节约当作煤炭工业全体职工的经常的经济和政治任务。我们着重地反对缺乏经济观点，忽视经济核算，不严格执行节约制度，不重视节约等各种错误思想，削减了非生产性建设的投资七百多万元，增加了一些新的建设项目，把能提前开工的工程提前开工了。为了降低工程造价，广泛采取了就地取材和节省钢材的办法。我们原计划在基本建设方面节约五万五千九百元，截至九月底止，已完成五万零二百五十八元，预计太原、重庆、沈阳、西安四个地区管理局可以超额完成节约计划。生产部分下半年除可保证弥补上半年超支数字外，还可超额完成国家规定降低成本百分之一点五的要求。
    我们虽然取得了以上的成绩，但是从目前的情况来看，全面完成今年的基本建设和生产计划，特别是基本建设计划，还需要克服很多困难。我们必须充分认识这些困难，积极采取措施，努力争取全面完成今年的计划，并且为明年的工作做好准备。
    各基本建设单位和施工单位必须加强对施工现场的领导，抓紧调度工作，沟通上下关系，及时解决问题，在保证质量和安全的条件下，争取完成今年的计划，同时对能够超额完成的主要工程应该尽量提前多做，一方面增加今年的工作量，加快建设速度，另一方面也可减少窝工浪费。一九五六年全国将有三十九处新矿井开工，另外还要续建矿井三十八处，改建矿井六处，恢复矿井三处。这些工程都要在今年做好准备工作，保证半数的新建矿井要在明年上半年开工。否则，就有完不成明年和第一个五年计划的基本建设任务的危险。当前煤矿基本建设中的主要问题还是地质赶不上设计，设计赶不上施工。最近，我们研究了煤矿建设的具体情况和特点，准备在地质构造简单、煤层稳定或半稳定的地区，在钻探工作完成或基本完成后即迅速提出设计必需的基本资料，以便据以进行设计。在地质报告批准后，设计部门应很快地提出施工准备工作必需的图纸，以便及早进行施工准备。对年产六十万吨以下的矿井，应该在初步设计批准后抓紧时间组织施工。这样，就可以把整个准备时间缩短两三个月。基本建设单位除积极完成今年的基本建设任务外，应该立即组织力量对明年的工程项目，特别是新建矿井，进行平衡摸底，争取新井提前开工。对明年第一季度的工作，要指定专人负责，做好第一季度开工的新井及跨年度工程的施工准备工作，才能保证第一季度至少完成明年全年任务的百分之二十。此外，对设备器材的供应，劳动力的调配及电源、铁路运输等问题，也要抓紧及时解决，以免因这些问题的拖延不决而影响施工。
    今年生产计划的执行情况虽然比较好，但是，前松后紧突击赶工的现象还相当普遍，掘进赶不上回采的需要，矿井地质和测量工作赶不上掘进需要的情况仍然严重，安全情况也不好。一九五六年的计划产量约较一九五五年增长百分之十一点九五，如不进一步改进企业管理，改善执行计划不够均衡的状况，就必然影响计划的全面完成。掘进落后于回采的需要，是一个老问题，至今没有彻底解决，主要是因为地质测量工作落后，不能为掘进工作面提供地质说明书，对掘进、回采起不到监督和指导的作用，使巷道布置的依据不够充分。由于掘进工作的落后，就严重地影响到均衡生产。因此，今年在完成计划产量的前提下，各矿务局应根据最近召开的全国煤矿第二届矿井地质工作会议的决定，加强矿井地质、测量工作，合理布置巷道，有效地加强掘进工作，消灭掘进工作中的无效进尺和呆滞煤量，保证有足够的准备工作面和获得煤量。今年一至九月份阜新矿务局就发生无效进尺一千八百四十八公尺，焦作矿务局也发生无效进尺二千公尺以上。淮南矿务局上半年的呆滞煤量占总获得煤量的百分之二十五左右，别的矿务局也有类似的情况。这种不合理现象，必须彻底改变。为了保证采煤和掘进工作的平衡，必须加强对掘进工作的领导，要建立主管掘进的专责机构，设立掘进区，指定专门工程师负责，组织掘进工作和正规循环作业，提高机械化程度，提高掘进机械的利用率。今年掘进机械的使用情况是不够好的，全国一至八月份掘进的装煤机械化程度仅为百分之九点三八。全国掘进装煤机、装岩机数量本来不多，而使用的又不足半数，这就大大影响了掘进的进度。这种情况必须下最大的决心予以改变。同时，在完成今年的生产计划中，必须做好明年准备工作。有条件能提前动手进行检修的矿井，必须立即订出检修计划，做好备件等准备工作。对于急待检修，而又需要较长时间检修的大型设备，尤其应该提前检修。
    必须承认，全面完成今年的基本建设和生产计划是有困难的，但是只要我们充分认识这种困难，紧紧地依靠党、依靠全体职工和工程技术人员，积极创造条件，克服困难，就有可能全面地完成今年的计划，并且做好各项准备工作，为完成一九五六年计划及第一个五年计划奠定可靠的基础。
