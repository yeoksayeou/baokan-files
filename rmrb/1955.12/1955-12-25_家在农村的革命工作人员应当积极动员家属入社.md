    Revolutionary Workers with Families in the Countryside Should Actively Encourage Family Members to Join Cooperatives
    Editor:
    Our organization is enthusiastically studying the documents on agricultural cooperation. During the study, everyone examined their attitude towards the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    Among the thirteen comrades in our study group, six have families in the countryside. Comrade Wang Zhihong paid attention to encouraging his family to join the cooperative. His family is of middle peasant background, and his younger brother actively advocated joining the cooperative, but his father resolutely refused. He repeatedly persuaded him, and finally convinced his father to agree to join the cooperative. However, the other five comrades did not pay attention to this important task. They even failed to seize the opportunity to educate their parents about taking the path of cooperation when they came to the organization to visit them. As a result, their families have not joined the cooperative, which has already had a negative impact among the villagers.
    This study has enhanced our understanding. The comrades in our group who have families in the countryside have all written letters to their families, explaining the benefits of cooperation and urging them to join the cooperative. We hope that all revolutionary workers with families in the countryside can do the same, so that the families of revolutionary workers can play a leading role in the agricultural cooperation movement and not lag behind the masses!

### 家在农村的革命工作人员应当积极动员家属入社

    家在农村的革命工作人员应当积极动员家属入社编辑同志：
    我们机关正在热烈地学习关于农业合作化问题的文件。在学习中，大家检查了自己对待农业社会主义改造的态度。
    我们学习小组十三个同志中有六个人的家在农村。其中王志洪同志注意了鼓励家属入社的工作。他家是中农成份，弟弟积极主张入社，可是父亲却坚决不肯。他就多次劝说，终于使他父亲同意入社了。但是，其他五个同志却没有注意这项重要工作，甚至当老人到机关来探望他们的时候也不抓紧机会进行走合作化道路的教育，因此他们的家庭都没有入社，这在乡亲中已经引起了不好的影响。
    这次学习使我们提高了认识，我们小组里家在农村的同志都写信给家里，说明合作化的好处，动员家中一定要参加合作社。我们希望所有家在农村的革命工作人员都能这样做，使革命工作人员的家属在农业合作化运动中起带头作用，不要落在群众的后面！
