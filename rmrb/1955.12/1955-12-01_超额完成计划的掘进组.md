    The Over-fulfilling Excavation Team
    Liu Jingwen
    Before National Day this year, the Bai Shuanbao excavation team of Longyan Iron Mine completed four years of work in two years and eight months.
    When the Bai Shuanbao team was first established, the mine's No. 55 inclined shaft was just beginning to be excavated, and the leadership assigned this task to them. At that time, the working environment of the No. 55 inclined shaft was very harsh: water flowed continuously from the top and walls of the shaft, and the steep slope was so slippery that people could not stand still. Workers used baskets to transport slag and buckets to drain water; each person carried out 1,500 catties of rock slag or carried out hundreds of buckets of water per shift.
    During the excavation, the inclined shaft excavation face encountered a large fault, requiring excavation and support at the same time. Because the roof was shale, it fell as it was hit. As a result, many supports were crushed, and the excavation progressed slowly. After careful research, everyone cut the working face into a long, steep slope to bypass the fault and find the ore layer.
    Then, they went to excavate the No. 25 rock roadway. This rock roadway would become the main ore outlet for the two pits of the Western Mining Department during the first Five-Year Plan period. This was an old rock roadway that had been excavated by Japanese imperialism during its occupation, and the roof had collapsed to a height of several dozen feet. One day, when the workers of the Bai Shuanbao team had just excavated more than twenty meters, the roof collapsed, and large stones fell down with a bang. After work, Bai Shuanbao, without even eating dinner, went to study with an old support worker from another level roadway and finally came up with a "piercing beam protection" method to free the working face from the threat of falling rocks. Later, when they encountered quartzite that could not be drilled in the roadway, they learned from the Soviet advanced experiences of fissure blasting and the use of multiple pneumatic drills, as well as the advanced excavation experience of Ma Wan Shui and others, and created a new mine record of excavating 55 meters per month in quartzite, completing the task of excavating the No. 25 rock roadway on time.
    The task of exploration increased year by year, but excavation always lagged behind exploration. To speed up the excavation progress, the slot must be deepened. To deepen the slot, the slotting method must be improved. The whole team constantly held "Zhuge Liang meetings" and finally developed a new slotting method. Using this method, one shot could penetrate 1.1 meters, which was 30 centimeters more than the level already achieved by Ma Wan Shui's team's advanced experience at that time. In 1954 alone, the Bai Shuanbao team completed the excavation equivalent to one year and seven months of work. The Longyan Iron Mine General Plant summarized their created slotting method and promoted it throughout the mine, reversing the situation where the mine's excavation could not keep up with the needs of mining.
    Over the past few years, the Bai Shuanbao team has overcome difficulties, worked hard, and actively improved technology in this way, opening up seven large inclined shafts and level roadways, and penetrating thousands of meters of hard rock. From the beginning of 1953 to September 25 this year, the whole team successfully completed four years of work in two years and eight months.
    Now, they have also participated in the mine's largest construction project - excavating a level adit. The entire team of workers has put forward a new goal: to strive to over-fulfill the annual workload for 1957 before "July 1st" next year.

### 超额完成计划的掘进组

    超额完成计划的掘进组
    刘景文
    今年国庆节前夕，龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进小组以两年零八个月的时间，完成了四年的工作量。
    白拴宝小组刚刚成立的时候，矿山的五十五大斜井正开始开凿，领导上就把这一任务交给了他们。当时五十五大斜井的工作环境非常艰苦：井内顶上的水和井壁上的水不停地流着，很陡的斜坡滑得连人都站不住。工人们用筐来运碴，用水桶来排水；每人每班背出一千五百斤石碴，或挑出几百桶水。
    在掘进中，斜井掘进面遇到一个大断层，需要一面掘进，一面支柱。因为顶板是页岩，随打随落。结果支柱被压倒了不少，掘进进展缓慢。经过大家苦心研究，把工作面切成个长陡坡，才绕过了断层，找到了矿层。
    接着，他们又去开凿二十五号石巷。这个石巷将成为西采矿部两个坑在第一个五年计划时期的主要出矿道。这是日本帝国主义在侵占时期曾经开凿过的旧石巷，落顶已经高达数丈。一天，白拴宝小组工人们刚掘进到二十多公尺的地方，顶板就塌落了，大石块乒乓地向下落。白拴宝下了班，连饭都不顾吃，就去和另一个平巷的老支柱工研究，最后想出了个“穿梁护顶”的办法，使工作面摆脱了落石头的威胁。后来，在巷道里又碰上了打不进眼的石英石，他们就学习苏联先进的龟裂爆破和使用多台风钻的经验以及马万水等的先进掘进经验，创造了掘进石英岩月进五十五公尺的全矿新纪录，按时完成了开凿二十五号石巷的任务。
    探矿的任务一年比一年增多，可是掘进总赶不上探矿。要想加快掘进进度，必须把槽子拉深。要想把槽子拉深，必须改进拉槽方法。全组不断地召开“诸葛亮会”，终于研究出了一种新的拉槽方法，用这种方法，一炮就打进了一点一公尺，比马万水小组的先进经验当时已达到的水平多进了三十公分。一九五四年一年中，白拴宝小组就完成了相当一年零七个月的掘进量。龙烟铁矿总厂总结了他们创造的拉槽方法，并且在全矿推广，扭转了全矿掘进赶不上采矿需要的局面。
    几年来，白拴宝小组就是以这样克服困难、艰苦奋斗和积极改进技术的精神，打通了七个较大的斜井和平巷，穿通了数千公尺坚硬的岩石。从一九五三年初到今年九月二十五日，全组用二年八个月的时间，胜利完成了四年的工作量。
    现在，他们又参加了全矿最大的建设工程——开凿平峒。全组工人又提出了新的奋斗目标：争取在明年“七一”以前，超额完成一九五七年全年工作量。
