How the Xinjin County Cultural Center Cooperates with the Cooperative Movement to Carry Out Rural Cultural Work
Liaoning Provincial Cultural Bureau

    The agricultural cooperative movement in Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, has long seen significant development. However, the Xinjin County Cultural Center's work scope has been limited to the town of Piziwo, where it is located, and it has not undertaken much work in the vast rural areas.

    As early as August 1954, the Xinjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Bureau of Culture and Education, based on the spirit of the General Line and the "Instructions on Rectifying and Strengthening the Work of Cultural Centers and Stations" of the Central Ministry of Culture, and combined with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement and the urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants for cultural and artistic life, inspected the work of the County Cultural Center. It was clearly pointed out that the guiding principles and tasks of the Cultural Center must be oriented towards the countryside and serve the cooperative movement and agricultural production increase. At the same time, some cadres with strong working abilities were transferred to strengthen the leadership of the center. From then on, the focus of the Cultural Center's work began to shift to the countryside and the cooperative movement.

    When the Xinjin County Cultural Center shifted its work focus to the agricultural cooperative movement, it determined the method of "from near to far, in-depth focus, and comprehensive guidance." Under normal circumstances, agricultural production cooperatives and cooperative villages closer to the center were chosen as the focus, so that work could be summarized and studied in a timely manner at the center in the initial stage. Villages with a better mutual aid and cooperation foundation were focused on the cooperative as the work unit. Villages with a weaker foundation for cultural activities were to first carry out activities and pay attention to cultivating backbones. Strengthen guidance work in villages with a certain cultural activity foundation. After gaining experience in key villages, it was to be promoted throughout the county. At the same time, it was decided to hand over many of the mass amateur art organizations on the streets, which were originally taken care of by the Cultural Center, to the masses, making them mass-run art organizations, with the Cultural Center providing necessary guidance to them. In this way, the Cultural Center could free up its hands and devote all its efforts to rural cultural activities.

    The Cultural Center first determined to focus on Songjia Village to carry out cultural activities in coordination with the expansion and establishment of cooperatives at that time.

    Before going to the countryside, the cadres of the Cultural Center first participated in the county, district, and village cadre meetings convened by the county party committee to specifically understand the party committee's work intentions and requirements. They also asked the district committee to introduce the political and economic situation of Songjia Village. Later, they contacted the village party branch, and the party branch secretary introduced the construction of the cooperative and the current ideological trends of the masses. Based on these real situations, the Cultural Center formulated a work plan, and then organized a temporary small cultural service team mainly composed of the Chengguan District Store Employees' Trade Union Amateur Troupe, selected small singing materials such as "Joining the Cooperative" and "Organizing," and drew a series of picture books and slides on the growth process of the Yangshufang Village Five-Star Production Cooperative and other propaganda materials, and launched mass cultural activities in Songjia Village.

    During this period, they also maintained contact with the county's pilot work team at any time, researched and solved problems encountered in the work, and also adopted the method of "activity while visiting" to gradually become familiar with rural life. After conducting propaganda and education to the masses through various cultural activities, many farmers understood the benefits of joining the cooperative, dispelled ideological concerns, and asked to join the cooperative, which greatly promoted the construction of the cooperative.

    Because cultural activities promoted the work of building the cooperative, it was valued by the party branch, and also aroused the masses' interest in cultural activities. The party branch secretary said: "Literary and artistic propaganda can really play a role. In the past, the masses' thinking was not clear, mainly because we didn't publicize it well." With the active support of the party branch and the masses, the Cultural Center cadres actively cultivated backbones of literary and artistic activities (a total of more than 30 backbones were cultivated) while carrying out activities, and helped establish groups for literary and artistic, slide, and exhibition commentary. Since the establishment of these literary and artistic organizations, the literary and artistic activities in Songjia Village have become more active than before. The masses happily said: "Now that we have a cooperative, we also have plays to watch."

    Yangshufang Village is a cooperative village with a total of six agricultural production cooperatives. Among them, the Five-Star No. 1 Cooperative was established in 1952, and the number of farmers participating in the cooperative has grown from 11 households in the past to 105 households. In terms of cultural activities, various small literary and artistic organizations have been established in the past few years, but due to lack of guidance and experience, many organizations are not sound, activities are not regular, and the quality is not high. Based on these situations, the Cultural Center obtained the district committee's instructions on the work and, after studying the work plan with the village party branch, began to carry out cultural work in the Five-Star No. 1 Cooperative.

    The Cultural Center first guided the cooperative's literary and artistic activities to be closely integrated with the central work, and at the same time helped to improve and consolidate the existing cultural organizations, such as reading groups, newspaper reading groups, and drama troupes. After a period of rectification, in order to further unify the leadership of these organizations, facilitate planned activities, and better meet the needs of cooperative members for cultural life, a club was established with the consent of the cooperative.

    After the establishment of the club, it became an integral part of the cooperative. The party branch strengthened its leadership, and the branch secretary personally served as the director of the club's working committee. At the same time, the club's work was combined with the party's propaganda network to strengthen the ideological nature of the propaganda work, and the club's work was specifically led by the cooperative's cultural and educational committee member. In order to ensure the development of the club's work, the Communist Youth League branch often called on young league members to actively participate in activities at the branch meeting, and assigned outstanding league members to be responsible for the club's work. Under the leadership of the party branch and the cooperation and support of all parties, the club's work was closely integrated with production, and various activities were carried out regularly.

    Now, the Five-Star No. 1 Cooperative Club has established various literary and artistic groups, with more than 80 cooperative members participating in activities. Every day, during production breaks and rest periods, the club carries out various literary and artistic activities, such as singing clappers, cross-talk, and lotus falls, or reading newspapers and picture books. The library has an average of 30 readers reading books and newspapers every day, and reading groups have been established, and reading evening parties are often held.

    Through the various activities of the club, it has not only promoted production and enlivened the cultural life within the cooperative, but also influenced and helped the other five cooperatives to carry out literary and artistic activities.

    From the work of the Xinjin County Cultural Center facing agricultural production and cooperating with the agricultural cooperative movement, it can be seen that:

    1. The Cultural Center must closely rely on the leadership of the party committee. It is necessary to frequently ask the county party committee for instructions and reports, understand the county party committee's plans and intentions for carrying out the cooperative movement, and obtain instructions in a timely manner. The staff who go deep into the countryside should rely on the leadership of the district committee and the branch, and ask them to introduce the local political and economic situation and the ideological situation of the masses. The work plan should be submitted to them for review. In the work, it is necessary to ask for instructions and report frequently, and strive to participate in the relevant meetings convened by the village branch, so as to obtain work contacts and assistance.

    2. In areas where cooperation is developing, rural cultural work should be carried out with agricultural production cooperatives as the center. Relying on cooperatives to carry out mass cultural and artistic work can strengthen the planning of work and the organization of activities, which is of great benefit to cultural and artistic work, and also plays a role in promoting the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    3. It is necessary to carry out work according to the characteristics of the countryside. Although the cooperative movement is developing day by day, and the peasants' demand for cultural life is constantly increasing, it must be seen that the peasants live scattered, have a low level of education, have limited economic conditions, and have seasonal production characteristics. Therefore, in the work, it is necessary to implement the policy of amateur voluntarism, and carry out work on the principle of not spending money or spending less money. In terms of activity methods, small-scale activities suitable for fields and land heads should be carried out at ordinary times, and relatively concentrated large-scale activities can be carried out during slack seasons or festivals.

    4. It is necessary to strengthen the political and professional study of cadres, especially the study of the party's various policies in rural work, first of all the policies related to mutual aid and cooperation, so that the rural mass cultural work can adapt to the requirements of the current rural central work.

    5. It is necessary to rely on the masses and follow the mass line. Overcome the working style of taking on everything and doing everything for others, which is divorced from the masses, and conscientiously cultivate mass backbones, so that cultural work can take root in the countryside.

    新金县文化馆怎样配合合作化运动开展农村文艺工作
    辽宁省文化局
    辽宁省新金县的农业合作化运动早就有了很大的发展。但是，新金县文化馆过去的工作范围，一直只限于所在地貔子窝镇，对广大农村没有进行更多的工作。
    早在一九五四年八月间，中共新金县委和县文教科根据总路线的精神和中央文化部“关于整顿和加强文化馆、站工作的指示”，结合农业合作化运动的发展和广大农民对文化艺术生活的迫切要求，检查了县文化馆工作，曾明确指出文化馆的方针任务必须面向农村，为合作化运动和农业增产服务。同时，调派了一些工作能力较强的干部充实了馆的领导。从此文化馆的工作重点即开始转向农村、转向合作化运动了。
    新金县文化馆在把工作重点转向农业合作化运动的时候，确定了“从近到远、重点深入、全面辅导”的方法。在一般情况下选择距馆较近的农业生产合作社和合作化的村为重点，这样便于在初期及时回馆总结研究工作；对互助合作基础较好的村以社为工作重点；对文化活动基础较弱的村应先开展活动，并注意培养骨干；对有一定文化活动基础的村加强辅导工作；在重点村取得经验后，向全县推广。同时，决定将文化馆原来所包揽的街道上的许多群众业余文艺组织交给群众，成为群众自办的文艺组织，文化馆对它们进行必要的辅导。这样，文化馆就能腾出手来，以全付力量从事农村文艺活动了。
    文化馆先确定以宋家村为重点，配合当时扩社建社工作开展文艺活动。
    下乡之前，文化馆干部首先参加了县委召开的县、区、村干部会议，具体了解了党委的工作意图和工作要求，并请区委介绍了宋家村的政治经济情况，后来又同村的党支部取得了联系，由党支部书记介绍了建社工作情况和当前群众的思想动态。根据这些现实情况，文化馆制定了工作计划，随后组织了以城关区店员工会业余剧团为主的临时小型文化服务队，选择了“入社”“组织起来”等小型演唱材料，并绘制了杨树房村五星生产合作社成长过程的连环画和幻灯片等宣传材料，在宋家村展开了群众性的文艺活动。
    在此期间，他们还随时同县的试点工作组取得联系，研究和解决工作中所遇到的问题，同时又采取了“边活动、边访问”的办法逐渐地熟悉了农村生活。通过各种文艺活动对群众进行了宣传教育之后，许多农民懂得了入社的好处，打消了思想顾虑，纷纷要求入社，对建社工作起了很大的推动作用。
    由于文艺活动推动了建社的工作，得到了党支部的重视，也引起了群众对文艺活动的兴趣。党支部书记说：“文艺宣传可真起作用，过去群众思想不通，主要是怨咱们没宣传好。”在党支部和群众的积极支持下，文化馆工作干部一边开展活动，一边积极培养文艺活动骨干（共培养了骨干三十多人），并帮助建立了文艺、幻灯、展览解说等小组。自从这些文艺组织建立后，宋家村的文艺活动较前更加活跃了，群众高兴地说：“咱们有了社，也就有了戏看了。”
    杨树房村是一个合作化村，共有六个农业生产合作社。其中的五星一社是一九五二年建立的，参加社的农户已由过去的十一户发展到了一百零五户；在文艺活动方面，几年来曾建立了各种小型的文艺组织，但由于无人辅导，缺乏经验，因而组织多不健全，活动不经常，质量也不高。根据这些情况，文化馆取得区委对工作的指示并同该村党支部研究了工作计划之后，就在五星一社着手开展文艺工作。
    文化馆首先指导社的文艺活动要紧密结合中心工作，同时帮助健全和巩固了已有的各种文化组织，如读书组、读报组、剧团等。经过一个时期的整顿后，为了进一步把这些组织统一领导起来，便于有计划地开展活动，更好地满足社员对文化生活的要求，在社的同意下建立了俱乐部。
    俱乐部建立以后，就成为社的一个组成部分。党支部加强了对它的领导，支部书记亲自兼任俱乐部工作委员会主任，同时把俱乐部工作和党的宣传网结合起来，加强了宣传工作的思想性，并由社的文教委员具体领导俱乐部工作。团支部为了保证俱乐部工作的开展，经常在支部大会上号召青年团员积极参加活动，并责成优秀团员担任俱乐部工作。在党支部的领导和各方面的配合和支持下，俱乐部工作得以密切结合生产，经常地开展各项活动。
    现在，五星一社俱乐部已建立了各种文艺小组，有八十多名社员参加活动。每天在生产空隙和休息时间，俱乐部就展开了各种文艺活动，如演唱快板、相声、莲花落或阅读报纸和连环画；图书室平均每天有三十名读者读书看报，并建立了读书小组，经常举行读书晚会。
    通过俱乐部的各项活动，不仅推动了生产，活跃了社内的文化生活，并影响和帮助了另外五个合作社也开展了文艺活动。
    从新金县文化馆面向农业生产、配合农业合作化运动的工作中，可以看到：
    一、文化馆必须紧紧依靠党委的领导。要经常向县委请示报告，了解县委开展合作化运动的规划和意图，及时取得指示。深入农村的工作人员要依靠区委和支部的领导，要请他们介绍当地的政治、经济情况和群众的思想情况，拟订的工作计划要交给他们审阅。工作中必须多请示，勤汇报，争取参加村支部召开的有关会议，以便取得工作上的联系和帮助。
    二、在合作化发展的地区，应以农业生产合作社为中心开展农村文化工作。依靠合作社展开群众文化艺术工作，可以加强工作的计划性和活动的组织性，对文化艺术工作有很大好处，对推动农村互助合作运动也有作用。
    三、必须根据农村的特点开展工作。虽然合作化运动日益发展，农民对文化生活的要求不断提高，但必须看到农民居住分散、文化程度不高、经济条件有限、生产的季节性等特点，因此工作中必须贯彻执行业余自愿的方针，并在不花钱或少花钱的原则下来开展工作。在活动方式上，平时应开展适于田间地头的小型活动，农闲或节日可开展比较集中的大型活动。
    四、必须加强干部的政治、业务学习，特别是加强党在农村工作中各项政策首先是有关互助合作政策的学习，这样才能使农村群众文化工作适应当前农村中心工作的要求。
    五、必须依靠群众，走群众路线。克服大包大揽、包办代替的脱离群众的工作作风，认真培养群众骨干，使文化工作在农村中生根。
