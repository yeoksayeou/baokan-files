New Progress in Scientific Research of the Petroleum Industry

(By our staff reporter) With the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities and Soviet experts, the scientific research work of the petroleum industry sector has made progress. In the past two years, the scientific research results achieved by the petroleum industry sector have played a significant role in petroleum production, technological improvement, and the trial manufacture of new products.

In terms of artificial petroleum production and refining, the recovery of light oil has been successfully researched. A large amount of oil contained in pyrolysis gas was previously used as boiler fuel along with the gas. Through the efforts of scientists and workers, the Petroleum No. 1 Plant conducted a medium-sized test this year, determined the oil content value of the gas, and obtained operation and equipment data. Now, factories are preparing to establish equipment and universally recover light oil. It is estimated that this will increase petroleum production by 12 to 15 percent. In terms of natural oil, solving the problem of crude oil desalination and dehydration is one of the key issues in China's petroleum refining. Research in this area began as early as 1952. This year, based on the research results of the Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Refinery conducted more than 400 experiments and finally proved that adding cottonseed oil foots and caustic soda to make soap solution, and mixing it in crude oil, can achieve a desalination and dehydration efficiency of more than 95 percent. The successful research on desalination and dehydration has improved and increased the production of the Shanghai Refinery.

In terms of improving production technology, scientific research on low-temperature carbonization is being systematically carried out. In order to cooperate with the restoration and production of the low-temperature carbonization furnace of the Petroleum No. 5 Plant, the Petroleum No. 4 Plant conducted a medium-sized test of coal low-temperature carbonization, obtained operating conditions and design data, enabling the restoration work of the Petroleum No. 5 Plant to proceed quickly and smoothly. This research result also lays the foundation for the construction of new plants in the future. Secondly, in the field of synthetic petroleum, the Petroleum No. 6 Plant successfully refined thorium, solving the supply of thorium, the main component of the catalyst; in particular, it found the formation conditions of cobalt silicate and the influence of cobalt silicate on the activity of the catalyst, so that the manufacturing conditions of the catalyst have a theoretical basis and the quality is guaranteed. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Petroleum No. 6 Plant conducted a series of experimental research work, which greatly improved production. In the past year alone, the year-end oil yield increased by more than a quarter compared with the beginning of the year.

In terms of the trial manufacture of new products, since 1953, with the strong assistance of the Academy of Sciences, the number of new products trial-manufactured by the petroleum industry sector has been increasing every year. In 1954, eleven new products were trial-manufactured; this year, the research work of nine new products and the trial manufacture work of thirty-seven new products have been completed. The Yumen Refinery successfully trial-produced ceresin wax and petroleum jelly this year. This is the result of years of scientific research. This new product is not only the main raw material for high-grade lubricating grease, but also has great uses in industry and medicine. The Petroleum No. 7 Plant completed the trial manufacture and production of anticoagulants (used to lower the freezing point of lubricating oil) this year.

In order to provide data for the construction of new bases to develop new petroleum resources, the petroleum industry sector is carrying out a large number of resource evaluation and analysis and semi-industrial processing tests. In recent years, the petroleum industry sector has conducted sampling and analysis of coalfields and oil shale mines with refining prospects; systematic experimental research work has been carried out on some key coals and oil shales, such as Yuanbaoshan and Guchengzi coal mines, Huadian oil shale mine, etc.; and a lot of equipment has been added in resource analysis and testing.

In order to meet the country's needs for petroleum products, expand production, and solve the difficult problems in the petroleum industry through scientific research, it is very important. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry is currently studying how to strengthen scientific research, prepare for the establishment of scientific institutions, expand scientific research forces, and add instruments and equipment to meet the needs of complex technologies in the accelerated development of the petroleum industry in the future.

    石油工业科学研究工作有新进展
    本报讯　石油工业部门的科学研究工作在中国科学院、高等学校和苏联专家的帮助下获得进展。近两年来石油工业部门所取得的科学研究成果，对石油的生产、技术的改进和新产品的试制等起了很大作用。
    在人造石油生产炼制方面，轻质油回收已经研究成功。这些含在干馏瓦斯中的大量油质，过去一直随着气体作为锅炉燃料用。经过科学工作者和职工的努力，石油一厂今年进行了中型试验，确定了瓦斯含油率数值，取得了操作和设备数据。现在，各厂正准备建立装置，普遍进行轻质油回收。据估计，这将使石油产量提高百分之十二到十五。在天然油方面，解决原油脱盐脱水，是我国石油炼制的关键问题之一。这方面的研究工作，早在一九五二年就已开始。今年，上海炼油厂在科学院研究结果的基础上，经过四百多次试验，终于证明把棉籽油脚加上火碱制成肥皂溶液，混合在原油内，可使原油达到百分之九十五以上的脱盐脱水效率。脱盐脱水的研究成功，使上海炼油厂的生产得到改善和提高。
    在生产技术的改进上，低温干馏的科学研究工作正在系统地进行。为了配合石油五厂低温干馏炉的恢复和生产，石油四厂进行了煤低温干馏的中型试验，获得了操作条件和设计数据，使石油五厂的恢复工作能够迅速、顺利地进行。这一研究成果，并为今后新厂的建设打下基础。其次，石油六厂在合成石油方面，炼钍成功，解决了催化剂的主要成分钍的供应；尤其是找到了矽酸钴的生成条件和矽酸钴对催化剂的活性的影响，使催化剂的制造条件获得理论上的根据，质量有了保证。石油六厂根据苏联专家的建议，进行了一系列的试验研究工作，使生产大为提高。仅在去年，年终的出油率即较年初提高四分之一以上。
    在新产品试制方面，从一九五三年开始，在科学院的大力协助下，石油工业部门每年试制的新产品不断增加。一九五四年，试制成十一种新产品；今年已完成了九项新产品的研究工作和三十七项新产品的试制工作。玉门炼油厂今年试制地腊、凡士林成功。这是多年来科学研究工作的成果。这种新产品，不仅是高级润滑脂的主要原料，而且在工业、医药方面有很大用途。石油七厂今年完成了抗凝剂（降低润滑油的凝固点用）的试制和生产。
    为了给新基地建设提供数据以开发新的石油资源，石油工业部门正在进行大量的资源评价分析和半工业化的加工试验。几年来，石油工业部门对具有炼油希望的煤田及油页岩矿进行了采样分析；对一些重点的煤碳及油页岩，如元宝山、古城子煤矿、桦甸油页岩矿等，都进行了系统的试验研究工作；在资源分析试验方面也增添了不少设备。
    为了满足国家对石油产品的需要，扩大生产，通过科学研究工作来解决石油工业中的困难问题，是非常重要的。石油工业部目前正研究加强科学研究工作，筹建科学机构，扩大科学研究力量和增添仪器设备，以适应今后石油工业加速发展中的复杂技术方面的需要。
