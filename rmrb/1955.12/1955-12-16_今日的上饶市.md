Today's Shangrao City
    Zhu Qiming

    Shangrao City, located in northeastern Jiangxi Province, is a new type of city that has grown since liberation.

    Before liberation, Shangrao was a gloomy hell on earth. The notorious Kuomintang killing machine – the Shangrao Concentration Camp – was located here. The people of Shangrao City also suffered greatly during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule.

    In 1949, Shangrao was liberated, and the people of Shangrao City began to work for their own happiness and a better life.

    In the past six years, under the leadership of the Party, Shangrao City, like other parts of the country, has carried out economic recovery and construction, greatly changing its original appearance.

    Now, Shangrao City has become an important transportation hub. The Min-Gan Highway, with a total length of more than 500 kilometers, connects Fuzhou in Fujian to Shangrao and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Hundreds of tons of local and special products from Fujian are transported here every day, and then transported by rail to various parts of the country that need them. Among the local and special products are the famous Wuyi tea, southern Fujian longan, lychees, as well as timber and other agricultural products. At the same time, hundreds of tons of materials are transported from here to Fujian to supply the people of Fujian and the People's Liberation Army guarding the front lines in Fujian. Here is the transportation hub of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Thousands of cars travel back and forth every day, shouldering the important task of economic connection between Fujian and Jiangxi provinces.

    In the past, Shangrao's industry was pitifully small. After liberation, local industries began to be established. The newly built Shangrao Tea Factory is fully mechanized and can produce more than 800 tons of tea annually. In addition to supplying the domestic market, a large part of it is sold abroad, earning industrial equipment for the country. The Shangrao Thermal Power Plant, the first in Jiangxi Province's first five-year plan, was completed in 1953 and can now fully supply the city's industrial and lighting electricity. The newly built Shangrao Agricultural Tools Iron Factory, in addition to serving the transportation industry, can also manufacture new-style agricultural tools to serve agricultural production. The original two small-scale private weaving factories have now been merged into a joint public-private partnership. After expansion, machine equipment has been added, greatly improving labor productivity. Among the local industries are flour mills, grain processing plants, brick and tile factories, printing plants, etc. In recent years, the output value of local industries has increased year by year. In 1954, the city's total industrial output value increased by 147% compared with 1950.

    The development of economic construction has promoted the prosperity of the city. At the beginning of liberation, it was just a small town with less than 30,000 people; now, the permanent population has increased by nearly two times, and the floating population is often several thousand people. The people's material living standards are also constantly improving. In 1954, social purchasing power increased by 1.6 times compared with 1952, and the wage income of workers and staff increased by 32%. The increase in people's purchasing power has made commerce flourish. Customers in stores are constantly bustling every day. In the past, no one cared about printed cloth, wool, silk, etc., but now people are choosing them to their heart's content.

    The Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the people's cultural life. The Shangrao City Laboring People's Cultural Palace was completed in 1954. It has a cinema that can accommodate 1,500 people and a beautiful library. Last year, a lighted sports ground was also built.

    The hard work of the people is building Shangrao City younger and more beautiful every day.

    The newly built Xinjiang Grand Iron Bridge spans the Xinjiang River. Thousands of cars and tens of thousands of pedestrians pass through it every day. The Xinjiang Bridge is the traffic lifeline of Shangrao City. During the Kuomintang rule, it was built with wooden planks and stones, and was washed away whenever the spring floods rose. The Kuomintang bandits did not fundamentally think of a solution, but often used the name of "bridge repair" to extort a lot of money from the people. On the eve of liberation, even a shaky wooden bridge was destroyed by the reactionaries.

    The area of ​​Shangrao City has greatly expanded compared to the past. Seven new flat and neat roads have been built in the city. One tall building after another is constantly emerging from the piles of rubble in the past. The originally desolate North Gate Mountain, overgrown with weeds, has become a beautiful new railway village. Railway workers live in the clean houses built here. The Municipal Construction Committee is carrying out the dredging project of "West Moat" and plans to transform this dirty and smelly ditch into a beautiful scenic spot in the near future.

    Flowers and trees have been planted along the newly built river embankment on the riverside road. On the other side of the road, the neat rows of tall buildings are magnificent and spectacular. People who come here for the first time can never imagine that this used to be a pile of rubble with broken walls. (Attached picture)

    今日的上饶市
    朱启明
    江西省东北部的上饶市，是解放后成长起来的一座新型的城市。
    解放以前，上饶是一座阴森森的人间地狱，全国闻名的国民党杀人机构——上饶集中营，就设在这里。上饶市的人民，在国民党反动统治时期，也受尽了苦难。
    一九四九年，上饶解放了，上饶市的人民从此开始为自己的幸福、为自己的美好生活而劳动。
    六年来，在党的领导下，上饶市和祖国其他地方一样，进行了经济的恢复和建设工作，大大地改变了原来的面貌。
    现在，上饶市已经成为一座重要的交通城市。总长五百多公里的闽赣公路，自福建的福州至上饶衔接着浙赣铁路，每天，有几百吨的福建土、特产运到这里来，再由铁路运到祖国各个需要的地区去。土、特产中有著名的武夷茶叶、闽南桂圆、荔枝，以及木材和其他农产品等。同时，也有几百吨的物资，从这里运往福建，供应福建人民和守卫在福建前线的人民解放军。这里，是福建、江西两省交通的要冲，每天有千百辆的汽车往返奔驰，它们担负着福建、江西两省经济联系的重大任务。
    过去上饶的工业，是少得可怜的。解放后，开始建立地方工业。新建的上饶茶厂，全部用机器操作，每年可以生产茶叶八百吨以上，除供应国内市场外，有很大部分运销国外，为祖国换回工业器材。江西省第一个五年计划中的上饶火力发电站已经在一九五三年全部建成，现在可以充分供应全市工业用电和照明用电。新建的上饶农具铁工厂，除了为交通运输业服务外，并可以制造新式农具，为农业生产服务。解放以前原有的两家规模狭小的私营织布厂，现在已经合并改为公私合营，经过扩建后，添上了机器设备，大大提高了劳动生产率。在地方工业中，还有面粉厂、粮食加工厂、砖瓦厂、印刷厂等。几年来，地方工业的产值逐年提高，一九五四年全市的工业总产值，比一九五○年增长百分之一百四十七。
    经济建设的发展，促进了城市的繁荣。解放初，这里不过是一个不到三万人口的小城镇；现在，常住人口增加了近两倍，流动人口经常有几千人。人民的物质生活水平也在不断提高。一九五四年社会购买力比一九五二年增长了一点六倍，职工工资收入增长了百分之三十二。人民购买力的增长，使商业欣欣向荣，商店中的顾客，每天都络绎不绝，从前，无人问津的花布、呢绒、绸缎等，现在都被人们尽情地挑选着。
    党和人民政府十分关怀人民的文化生活。上饶市劳动人民文化宫，已在一九五四年建成，这里面有可以容纳一千五百人的电影院，有漂亮的图书室，去年，还建造了一个灯光球场。
    人们的辛勤劳动，把上饶市建设得一天比一天年轻秀丽。
    新建的信江大铁桥，横跨在信江上，每天有千百辆的汽车和成千上万的行人通过。信江桥是上饶市内的交通命脉，国民党统治时期，是用木板石头架成的，每当春汛水涨，就被冲毁。国民党匪帮不从根本上去想办法，反而经常借“修桥”的名义，敲诈人民大量的钱财。解放的前夕，连一座摇摇不稳的木板桥也给反动派破坏了。
    上饶市区的面积比从前大大扩展了。全市新建了七条平坦整齐的马路。在过去一堆堆的瓦砾中，不断出现一幢一幢的高大建筑物。原来荒无人烟丛草齐人的北门山，已成为一座美丽的铁路新村，铁路的职工们住进了建筑在这里的洁净的房屋里。市政建设委员会正在进行着疏濬“西濠”的工程，并规划在不久的将来，把这个几十年来肮脏的臭水沟改变为一个美丽的风景区。
    在沿河马路新建的河堤边沿，栽下了花木。在马路的另一边，整齐排列的高楼大厦，伟丽壮观。初到这里的人们绝不能想像从前这里是残墙断壁的瓦砾堆。（附图片）
