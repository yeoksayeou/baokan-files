    At the Delhi City Welcome Meeting
    Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling's Speech

    Mr. Chairman, Friends:

    It has been a long-standing personal wish of mine to visit India, this great nation. During most of those years, your country was engaged in a serious struggle against colonialism, while my own country was fighting for survival, with the people immersed in the crucible of revolutionary transformation. Several times it seemed that such a visit might be possible, but each time it was thwarted. Thus, in those days that brought severe trials to the people, I did not have the opportunity to bring the respect of one invincible nation to another.

    Only now are the conditions ripe for my wish to be realized. I would like to tell you that it gives me immense pleasure to be here with you, those who have waged a long and heroic struggle for the historic victory of your country's independence.

    My wish to visit India symbolizes the profound respect of the people of our country for the people of India. For many centuries, we have praised your art and culture. For many generations, we have cherished your friendship and neighborly affection. Chairman Mao Zedong succinctly and appropriately expressed our feelings when he said: "The Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are good people."

    The Indian people have also always had deep affection for the Chinese people. For thousands of years, this mutual respect has established peaceful ties between our two countries, a relationship that is truly unique in human history. I can say that in such a long time, this relationship has few parallels in history. This precious legacy inherited from ancient times has been strengthened by our common struggle against colonial oppression over the long years, and this precious legacy has laid the foundation for the harmonious ties we have established in the present era. Especially in recent years, the relations between China and India have entered a new stage of development. On the one hand, this relationship reflects the mutual concern and sympathy of our two peoples as they are both dedicated to the task of restoring and building their countries; on the other hand, our relationship also reflects our sincere desire to achieve peace in Asia and the world. This is particularly reflected in the fact that we cooperate with each other and support each other in opposing foreign interference in the internal affairs of our country and other countries. This interference constitutes the main cause of the tension in the Far East.

    The culmination of the new development of Sino-Indian relations is the historically significant event of the joint announcement by the Prime Ministers of our two countries of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely Panchsheel. Since then, we have been conscientiously implementing these principles in our daily affairs, demonstrating in practice that adhering to these principles can only bring benefits. This has not only consolidated peace in a large part of Asia, but has also successfully promoted the concept of peaceful coexistence between East and West, with many countries considering the Five Principles as a perfectly feasible set of guidelines for international behavior. We can see from this, as well as from the many events before and after the publication of these principles, that our friendship and cooperation are of great value to our two countries, to the Far East, and to the world.

    There was a time, and not so long ago, when the deliberate suppression by foreign forces prevented people from knowing the close relationship between the Chinese and Indian peoples. Now, such suppression is no longer possible. Therefore, what is happening between our two countries now often becomes the focus of public attention.

    This can be explained by the fact that since the end of World War II, the situation in Asia has changed. The people of this region, who have long struggled for their national rights and security, have achieved victory in some countries. China and India, as two major Asian countries, have shown with our actions as independent nations the will of a new Asia that is breaking free from bondage and backwardness. Since this will is the decisive factor in all Asian problems, and since this factor must be taken into account in all world problems, what China and India think and do will inevitably have particular significance.

    If people look at this fact from the perspective of modern life, they can see that it is a very prominent fact.

    The main problem facing the people of all countries now is the problem of peace. The desire of the vast majority of people to eliminate the possibility of another world war is obvious. But it cannot be denied that there are still a few people who are moving in a direction contrary to this desire, plotting and planning their military strength far beyond the normal range needed for national defense, thereby posing a threat to other countries. Thus, there are two main forces at work, and the issue of peace and war has become a key issue.

    Since ancient times, war has been the last resort for solving problems between countries. If it has never been a sober way to resolve differences from the perspective of the people, the only reason for not being able to prohibit this method is because history has not yet developed to the point where the people of all countries can use their wisdom in deciding such issues.

    But today, history has reached a turning point. More and more ordinary men and women everywhere are gradually realizing that as members of mankind, they have the right to decide the fate of mankind. On the basis of this understanding, some countries have been established, and these countries are acting on this basis. Not only that, but the people of all countries see that modern war is something that will immediately cause large-scale destruction. Obviously, the question of war or peace is something that the people of all countries can and must take into their own hands. This is a trend of thought and understanding. It is also the driving force of a movement that is rapidly strengthening, through which the majority is stopping those who attempt to violate human reason and destroy the safety of human survival. Their demand is to resolve issues between countries peacefully and to use the wonders of science to realize the hope that everyone can live a comfortable life. Anyone who is unwilling to see this demand will subject themselves to the condemnation of the whole world, thereby inevitably suffering defeat. China and India, with a population of 960 million, stand firmly on the side of the majority. We say that the people of all countries must be given justice and peace. We have proven in word and deed that we are ready and able to take on the important responsibility of advancing this noble cause. Time and again – often through joint efforts – we have achieved gains that are of great significance to the progress and security of the people in the Far East and other regions.

    If we look back at the recent past, we can see a series of remarkable achievements. The Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina were achieved through the efforts of China and India, with the strong cooperation of the Soviet Union and other countries. Today, India is shouldering a major responsibility in supervising the implementation of the agreements reached in Geneva.

    The historic Bandung Conference in April this year gave new impetus to the cause of self-determination for the Asian and African peoples and more firmly linked this cause with the broader cause of achieving international friendship and cooperation. The world knows how valuable contributions China and India made to this conference and its unanimous agreements, especially the conference's resolution on world peace and cooperation.

    Then, in June, Prime Minister Nehru visited the Soviet Union and other European countries. He jointly issued a historic statement with Chairman Bulganin of the Soviet Council of Ministers. This statement is a testament to the great friendship between the Soviet and Indian peoples. This statement is also a living example of how countries with different backgrounds, customs, and systems can coexist peacefully and cooperate with each other to extend goodwill to the widest possible area. The Nehru-Bulganin statement is another major victory for the Five Principles and the cause of peace. The recent visit of Chairman Bulganin of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Member Khrushchev of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to India further strengthened this point.

    Finally, people can see the various actions taken by China and India to ease tensions in the Far East and to find new ways to resolve outstanding issues. In particular, people can see our efforts to eliminate the disputes between China and the United States. We are making these efforts in the hope of making progress in fundamentally changing the relations between these two important countries, because the normalization of relations between these two countries is of great significance to the relations in the entire vast Asia-Pacific region.

    In this regard, one cannot fail to mention the difficulties and tensions caused by the United States' occupation of China's territory Taiwan and interference in the liberation of China's coastal islands. China has repeatedly suggested that the United States and China sit down to discuss ways to ease and eliminate these tensions. This suggestion has received widespread support from all those who are truly concerned about peace, especially the Indian people, who recognize the justice of China's demand that the internal affairs of a sovereign state must be resolved according to its own will. The Indian people support the Chinese people on the Taiwan issue, just as we fully support the Indian people on the Goa issue; the Goa issue is another blatant violation of the territorial integrity of an independent country. I am confident that China and India will use all the means of contact available to us to continue to work for a just solution to these and other sources of discord in the Far East.

    In all these activities, the Chinese people are deeply moved by the perseverance shown by Prime Minister Nehru and his government in seeking effective ways to bridge the gaps in international contact. During Prime Minister Nehru's visit to our country, he personally saw how deeply grateful we were for his tireless efforts, especially for his efforts to mediate on certain specific issues related to China. We cherish this effort because it comes from a good neighbor with good intentions, and it is also in the best interests of the people everywhere.

    On our part, the Chinese people's position is simple and clear: we demand peace. We harbor no ill will towards the people of any country. We do not threaten anyone, and we never have and never will tolerate threats from others. We are proud of our achievements, and we are ready to defend our achievements, but we are also willing to share these achievements with others. We are ready to cooperate with any country to implement any plan that recognizes the legitimate rights of the people of all countries, thereby dedicating itself to peace and based on the true equality of all countries. This position of ours applies to all issues, whether these issues are related to China and Chinese territory or to other countries. The attitudes and actions of India and China, the actions of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries – which have consistently adopted policies aimed at ending the “Cold War” and restoring international trust – and the recent attitudes of other countries in response to the overwhelming desire of the people of all countries for peace, all contribute to changing the international atmosphere.

    This new situation, which began to emerge due to the cooperation and willingness to listen to others expressed at the Geneva Four-Power Summit, has been warmly welcomed by all. The world eagerly awaits further steps that can be taken in this healthier atmosphere to continue and develop. Although the recent Four Foreign Ministers Conference did not yield positive results, the people of the world still hope to maintain the Geneva spirit and demand that more concrete actions be taken along the path that has been paved, which are conducive to international peace and security.

    This has been reflected in our part of the world, but what is urgently needed is to fully expand the new spirit to the Far East in order to lead to a thorough study of the various issues that exist here. The important issue now is that various Far Eastern issues cannot be “left unresolved” indefinitely. Nor can it be a matter of "getting used to letting them exist," as some people say, because that would be like getting used to letting time bombs exist. The important issue now is that all those who are concerned about peace hope to see these issues resolved fairly, and the sooner they are resolved, the sooner people can relax and believe that the new atmosphere is truly more lasting throughout the globe.

    On July 30 this year, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a report on foreign policy to the Second Session of the First National People's Congress of China. In that report, he adopted the following attitude towards the above issues.

    "Many Asian countries have put forward the suggestion of convening a Far Eastern conference in order to solve the problem of easing tensions in the Far East through consultation among the countries concerned. We support this suggestion and believe that the Far Eastern conference should have the broad participation of Asian countries."

    This is China's attitude towards the urgency of the Far Eastern issue. Prime Minister Nehru has expressed similar views.

    In the same report, Premier Zhou also expressed the hope of realizing the collective peace in the Asia-Pacific region first advocated by the Indian government. He said that this can be achieved through the countries in the region, including the United States, signing a collective peace convention. The purpose of this convention is to replace the antagonistic military treaties that currently exist in this region of the world, and in fact it can also provide a basis for these countries to develop their relations in a completely new way. This development, through the surge of commercial and cultural exchanges, will greatly benefit their people.

    Willing to negotiate on the issue of US-China tensions in the Taiwan region of Chinese territory, advocating the convening of a Far Eastern conference and the conclusion of a collective peace convention in the Asia-Pacific region, these are all concrete manifestations of the basic spirit of China's and India's foreign policy. This policy believes that today, the governments of all countries have an obligation to seek ways of peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation, recognizing that it should be up to the people of each country to decide which way of life is most suitable for them.

    It is this idea that promotes the relationship between China and India, promotes our friendship, enhances our cooperation, and expands our contribution to peace in the Far East and the world.

    In the past year, we have exchanged cultural delegations. We have not only discovered many things in each other's performances that illustrate our long-standing connections, but these performances have also pleased the people of our two countries and further consolidated our mutual feelings. We are indeed willing to learn more and more about each other's lives through this form or other forms.

    Trade between our two countries is also developing, and as the economies of our two countries continue to develop, the prospects for economic cooperation should be able to increase further. Such recent connections established between us, our measures to exchange scholars, students, experts, technicians and information materials between our two countries will help to consolidate the friendship between China and India. Such an exciting phenomenon in the modern world is invaluable to the people of our two countries. We must do everything we can to cherish it and give it the conditions for further development.

    I believe we will definitely do this. I am confident that the people of China and India, through our long-standing mutual goodwill relations, through our tradition of mutual sympathy in the past struggle for independence, and through our increasingly strengthened friendship in recent times, will, together with other peace-loving countries and peoples, make further progress in realizing the cause of peace and progress in the Far East and the whole world.

    Long live the great friendship between the people of China and India!
    Long live peace in Asia!
    Long live world peace!

### 在德里全市欢迎会上  宋庆龄副委员长的讲话

    在德里全市欢迎会上
    宋庆龄副委员长的讲话主席先生、朋友们：
    访问印度这个伟大的国家一直是我个人多年来的愿望。在这些年代中的大部分年代里，你们的国家处在严重的反对殖民主义的斗争中，而我自己的国家则是在进行争取生存的战争，人民投身在革命的转变的熔炉中。有好几次看起来这种访问似乎是可以实现的，可是每一次都因为受到了阻挠而没有实现。就这样，在那些给人们带来严重的考验的时日里，我没有获得机会来把一个不可战胜的民族的敬意带给另外一个不可战胜的民族。
    只有现在才具备了条件，使我的愿望得以实现。我愿意告诉你们，能够来到这里，和你们这些曾经为了争取祖国独立的具有历史意义的胜利而进行长期英勇的斗争的人在一起，使我感到莫大的愉快。
    我的访问印度的愿望象征着我国人民对于印度人民的崇高的敬意。许多世纪以来，我们一直称赞你们的艺术和文化。许多世代以来，我们一直珍视你们的友情和邻人的情谊。毛泽东主席简明恰当地表达了我们的感情，他说：“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民。”
    印度人民同样也一向对中国人民有着深切的感情。几千年来，这种相互尊重使我们两国建立了和平的联系，这种联系在人类历史中的确是独一无二的。我可以说，在这样长的时间中，这种联系在历史上是极少可以与之比拟的。古代遗留下来的这种宝贵的遗产因我们在漫长的年月里进行的反对殖民主义压迫的共同斗争而加强了，这种宝贵的遗产为我们建立起来的目前时代的和谐的联系奠定了基础。特别是在最近几年来，中印两国的联系进入了新的发展阶段。一方面，这种联系反映了我们两国人民由于都在致力于恢复和建设国家的任务而产生的相互关切和同情；另一方面，我们之间的关系也反映了我们对于实现亚洲和世界和平的真诚的愿望。这一点特别反映在这样一个事实上，那就是我们彼此合作，互相支持以反对外国一味对我们和其他国家的内部事务进行的干涉。这种干涉构成了远东紧张局势的主要原因。
    中、印关系新发展的顶点是我们两国总理共同宣布和平共处的五项原则，即潘查希拉这样一件具有历史意义的事情。自从那时以来，我们一直在我们的日常事务中认真实行这些原则，在实践中证明遵守这些原则只会得到好处。这不仅巩固了亚洲很大一部分地区的和平，并且已经成功地促进了在东西方之间实行和平共处的观念，有许多国家认为五项原则是一套完全可行的指导国际行为的准则。我们可以从这一点以及从这些原则发表前后的许多事件中看出，我们之间的友谊和合作对于我们两国、对于远东和世界都是有极大价值的。
    曾经有一个时期，并且不是很久以前，外来势力的处心积虑的压制使人民不能知道中国人民和印度人民之间的密切关系。现在这种压制已经再没有可能了。因而，现在我们两国间发生的事情经常成为公众注意的中心。
    这可以用这样的事实来解释，就是自从第二次世界大战结束以来，亚洲事态已经有了转变。长期以来一直为自己的民族权利和安全而奋斗的这个地区的人民已经在一些国家中获得了胜利。中国和印度这两个亚洲大国已经以我们作为独立国家的行动表明了正在摆脱束缚和落后状态的新亚洲的意志。由于这种意志是一切亚洲问题中的决定性因素，由于在一切世界问题中必须考虑到这个因素，中国和印度所想的和所做的必然将具有特别重要的意义。
    如果人们从现代生活的角度来看这个事实，就可以看出这是一个非常突出的事实。
    各国人民现在所面临的主要问题是和平问题。绝大多数人希望消除另一次世界大战的可能性的愿望是很明显的。但是人们不能否认现在仍然有少数人正在循着同这种愿望相反的方向前进，策划和计划他们的远远超过国防所需的正常范围以外的军事实力，从而构成了对别国的威胁。由此可见有两种主要势力正在起着作用，和平和战争的问题成了关键问题。
    自远古以来，战争一直是解决各国之间存在的问题的最后手段。如果说，从人民的观点来看这从来就不是解决分歧的头脑清醒的办法的话，那么，没有能够禁止这种办法的唯一原因是因为历史还没有发展到各国人民能够在决定这种问题上使用自己的智慧的程度。
    但是，今天历史已经到了转变的时候。各个地方愈来愈多的普通男女逐渐认识到自己作为人类的一员有权决定人类的命运。在这种认识的基础上，已经建立了一些国家，并且这些国家正在这种基础上进行活动。不仅如此，各国人民都看到现在的战争是会立即引起大规模毁灭的事情。显然，是战争还是和平的问题是各国人民能够也必须自己掌握的事情。这是思想和认识的趋势。这也是一种正在迅速加强的运动的推动力，多数人正在通过这种运动来制止那些企图违反人类理智和破坏人类生存安全的少数人。他们的要求就是要和平地解决国与国之间的问题和把科学的奇迹用于实现一切人都能过康乐生活的希望。谁不愿意看到这种要求就会使自己遭到全世界的谴责，从而使自己不可避免地要遭到失败。拥有九亿六千万人口的中国和印度坚决站在大多数人一边。我们说，一切国家的人民一定要得到正义和和平。我们已经用言行证明我们是准备，也是能够负起把这个崇高事业向前推进的重大责任的。我们一次又一次地——常常是通过共同的努力——取得了对远东以及其他地区的人民的进步和安全具有重要意义的收获。
    如果我们回顾一下最近的过去，我们就能看到一系列的显著的成就。朝鲜停火和印度支那的和平的恢复都是通过中国和印度的努力在苏联和其他国家的有力合作下实现的。今天，印度正在监督在日内瓦达成的协定的实施方面担负着重大的责任。
    今年四月在万隆举行了历史性的会议，这个会议给予亚非人民的自决事业以新的推动力，并且使这个事业同实现国际友好和合作的更广泛的事业更牢固地联系起来。全世界都知道中国和印度对这个会议和它的一致协议、特别是会议关于世界和平和合作的决议，作了多么有价值的贡献。
    然后在六月里，尼赫鲁总理访问了苏联和其他欧洲国家。他同苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁联名发表了历史性的声明。这个声明是苏联人民和印度人民的伟大友谊的证明。这个声明还是具有不同背景、风俗和制度的国家怎样和平共处、互相合作，来把善意扩大到尽可能广大地区的活生生的例子。尼赫鲁—布尔加宁声明是五项原则和和平事业的又一重大胜利。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫最近对印度的访问进一步加强了这一点。
    最后，人们可以看到中国和印度为了缓和远东紧张局势、设法找出解决未决问题的新途径而采取的各种行动。人们特别可以看到我们为了消除中国和美国之间的争执问题而进行的努力。我们进行这种努力是希望能够在根本改变这两个重要国家的关系方面有所进展，因为这两个国家的关系的正常化对于整个广大的亚洲及太平洋地区的关系有莫大的意义。
    关于这点，人们不能不提到由于美国占领中国的领土台湾和干涉中国沿海岛屿的解放而造成的困难和紧张局势。中国已经多次建议美国和中国坐下来讨论和缓和消除这些紧张局势的方法。这种建议已经获得了所有真正关心和平的人们、特别是印度人民的广泛支持；印度人民认识到中国关于主权国家的内政必须按照它自己的意志来解决的要求的正义性。印度人民在台湾问题上支持中国人民，就像我们在果阿问题上充分支持印度人民一样；果阿问题是彰明昭著地侵犯一个独立国家的领土完整的又一个例子。我确信中国和印度将利用我们可以获得的一切联络方法，继续努力使远东不和的这些根源和其他根源获得公正的解决。
    在所有这些活动中，中国人民对尼赫鲁总理和他的政府在寻求有效办法来填平国际接触中的鸿沟的时候所表现的坚毅精神，深为感动。在尼赫鲁总理访问我国的时候，他亲眼看到我们对他的不知疲倦的努力，特别是对他在有关中国的某些具体问题上进行斡旋的努力，是怀着多么深切的感激的心情。我们珍视这种努力，因为这种努力是从一个怀着好意的好邻居那里来的，同时这种努力也符合一切地方的人民的最高利益。
    在我们方面，中国人民的立场是简单明了的：我们要求和平。我们对任何国家的人民都没有恶意。我们不威胁任何人，现在也好，过去也好，我们也决不容忍其他人的威胁。我们对我们的成就感到自豪，我们准备保卫我们的成就，但是我们也愿意与人共享这种成就。我们准备同任何国家进行合作来实现任何承认各国人民的合法权利从而致力于和平并且以各国真正平等为前提的计划。我们这种立场适用于一切问题，不论这些问题是有关中国和中国领土的也好，有关其他国家的也好。印度和中国的态度和行动，苏联和其他爱好和平国家——这些国家一贯采取目的在于结束“冷战”和恢复国际信任的政策——的行动，其他国家最近响应各国人民要求和平的压倒一切的愿望而采取的态度，这一切都有助于国际气氛的改变。
    这种新局势是由于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上表现的合作和愿意听取别人意见的态度而开始产生的，它受到了所有的人的热烈欢迎。全世界热切期待在这种较健康的气氛继续存在下去并得到发展的情况下能够采取的进一步的步骤。虽然最近的四国外长会议没有得到积极的结果，但是世界各国人民仍旧希望保持日内瓦精神，并且要求沿着已经铺平的道路采取有利于国际和平和安全的更具体的行动。
    这一点已经在世界的我们这一部分得到反映，但是迫切需要的是把新精神全面扩大到远东，以便导致对这里存在的各项问题进行彻底的研究。现在重要的问题是各项远东问题不能无限期地“悬而不决”。也不能像有些人说的那样是“习惯于听任它们存在下去”的问题，因为这样将好像习惯于听任定时炸弹存在下去一样。现在重要的问题是所有关心和平的人都希望看到这些问题得到公平解决，并且解决得越快，人们就能越快地放下心来，相信新气氛真正比较持久地在遍及全球。
    今年七月三十日，周恩来总理向中国第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议作了外交政策报告。他在那个报告中对上述问题采取了如下的态度。
    “许多亚洲国家已经提出了召开远东会议的建议，以便由有关国家协商解决和缓远东紧张局势的问题。我们支持这一建议，并且认为在远东会议中应该有亚洲国家的广泛参加。”
    这就是中国对远东问题的迫切性所采取的态度。尼赫鲁总理曾发表过类似的意见。
    周总理在同一报告中也表示希望实现印度政府首先提倡的亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平。他说，这可以通过这一地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约来实现。这个公约的目的是代替目前存在于世界这个地区的对立性的军事条约，而且事实上它还可以提供基础，使这些国家之间的关系获得一种面貌全新的发展。这种发展，通过商业和文化交流的高涨，将使它们的人民获得很大的好处。
    愿意就中国领土台湾地区的中美紧张关系问题进行谈判，主张召开远东会议和缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平公约，这些都是中国和印度的外交政策基本精神的具体表现。这种政策认为今天世界各国政府有义务寻求和平共处和相互合作的方法，承认应当由各国人民自己决定最适合于自己的生活方式。
    推进中国和印度的关系、促进我们的友谊、增进我们的合作、扩大我们对远东和世界和平的贡献的，就是这种思想。
    在过去一年中，我们互派了文化代表团，我们不仅在彼此的演出中发现了许多说明我们的历史悠久的联系的东西，而且这些演出也使我们两国人民感到高兴，并且进一步巩固了我们相互间的感情。我们的确愿意通过这一种形式或者其他的形式来越来越多地了解彼此的生活。
    我们两国之间的贸易也正在发展着，随着我们两国的经济的继续发展，经济合作的前景应当能够进一步增加。我们之间最近建立起来的这样一些联系、我们两国之间交换学者、留学生、专家、技术人员和情况材料的措施都会有助于巩固中印两国之间的友谊。现代世界的这样一个令人兴奋的现象对于我们两国人民都是十分宝贵的。我们必须尽一切力量爱护它，并且使它具有获得进一步的发展的条件。
    我相信我们一定会这样作。我确信，中印两国人民借着我们的具有悠久历史的相互亲善关系，借着我们过去在争取独立的斗争中互相同情的传统，借着我们近来越来越加强的友谊，一定会同其他爱好和平的国家和人民一道，使实现远东和全世界的和平和进步的事业获得进一步的进展。
    中印两国人民的伟大友谊万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
