Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta dispatch from TASS: Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage arrived in Calcutta by plane from Madras at 2:00 PM on November 29th.

    West Bengal Chief Minister B. C. Roy delivered a welcoming speech to the guests on a specially constructed platform at the airport. He sincerely welcomed the guests on behalf of the residents of Calcutta and the people of West Bengal.

    Bulganin delivered a reply. He said, "Today, with great joy, we set foot on the land of Bengal, which has played such a significant role in the history of India, the history of the Indian national liberation movement, and in India's economic and cultural development. The wealth of golden Bengal is immeasurable, and we share your joy that today the people of Bengal are becoming masters of the wealth they create, so that this wealth may serve their motherland. The Soviet people are watching with great interest the progress made by independent India."

    At 2:30 PM, a motorcade carrying the guests departed from the airport for the city of Calcutta.

    Enthusiastic and joyous crowds from Calcutta and its vicinity stood on both sides of the fifteen-kilometer road from the airport to the city center, cheering the Soviet leaders. In the central area near the Governor's Residence, where the Soviet dignitaries were staying, the streets were so crowded that vehicles had difficulty passing. It took two hours to travel from the airport to the Governor's Residence.

    Calcutta welcomed the Soviet leaders with an unprecedented display of affection. Indian authorities estimated that no less than three million residents of Calcutta and nearby towns and villages welcomed Khrushchev and Bulganin on the streets of Calcutta as they drove by.

    加尔各答城乡居民三百万人
    热烈欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫
    新华社据塔斯社加尔各答讯　布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和他们的随行人员十一月二十九日下午两时坐飞机从马德拉斯到达加尔各答。
    西孟加拉省首席部长布·克·罗伊在机场上特地搭起来的一个台子上对客人们致欢迎词。他代表加尔各答市居民和西孟加拉人民诚恳地欢迎客人们的来临。
    布尔加宁致答词。他说，我们今天怀着极大的欢乐心情踏上了在印度历史和印度民族解放运动的历史中，以及在印度的经济和文化发展方面起了这样重大作用的孟加拉的土地。黄金似的孟加拉的财富是不可估量的，我们和你们一道感到高兴的是，今天孟加拉人民正在成为他们所创造的财富的主人，以便使这种财富为他们的祖国服务。苏联人民以极大的兴趣注视着独立的印度所取得的进展。
    二时三十分，一队载着客人的汽车从机场驶往加尔各答市。
    加尔各答的和从它附近来的热情高涨的和喜气洋洋的人群，站在从机场到市中心的十五公里长的道路的两旁向苏联领袖欢呼。在苏联贵宾下榻的省长官邸附近的中心区，街道上是这样拥挤，以致车辆很难通行。从机场到省长官邸一共走了两个小时。
    加尔各答用一种前所未见的充满热爱的行动来欢迎苏联的领袖们。印度当局估计，在赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁坐车从街上走过的时候，加尔各答和附近城镇、乡村的居民不下三百万人在加尔各答的街道上欢迎他们。
