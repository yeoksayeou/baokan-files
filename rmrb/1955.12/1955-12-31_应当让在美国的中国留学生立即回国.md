Observer's Commentary:

    Today, this newspaper publishes five letters from the families of our Chinese students in the United States. These letters unanimously denounce the U.S. government's obstruction of their relatives' return to China, demanding that the U.S. government allow their relatives to return to China immediately and reunite with them. Anyone with a sense of justice who reads these letters cannot help but sympathize with their urgent desire and feel indignant at the U.S. government's obstruction of Chinese students returning home.

    The writers of these letters are either fathers or mothers over the age of sixty, or wives who have been separated from their husbands for ten years. Who dares to say that their desire to reunite with their loved ones should not be quickly realized? However, the irrefutable facts tell the world that the U.S. government, which has always touted humanitarianism, is doing something inhumane by forcibly separating thousands of Chinese families, making it impossible for them to reunite.

    From these five letters alone, it can be seen that the U.S. government is persecuting Chinese students in various ways in order to obstruct their return to China. The U.S. government not only uses despicable means such as sentencing them to five years in prison and fining them two thousand dollars to threaten Chinese students who apply to return home, but even prevents them from communicating with their families and forbids them from expressing their desire to return home. The fact that Shen Fachun and Gao Hongye have not written to their families for a long time, and that Hu Shengen asked his wife not to mention the issue of returning home in her letters, is clearly the result of the U.S. government's persecution of them.

    Even now, although the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks have reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians from both sides more than three months ago, Feng Yuanzhen, Yu Xianshi, Gao Hongye, Liu Anhua, Ling Han, Hu Shengen, Shen Fachun and others have still not been able to return. Of the 103 Chinese people whom the U.S. side admitted had long requested to return home but were prevented from leaving the country by the U.S. government, 38 have not yet returned to China. It is conceivable that there are still thousands of people like Feng Yuanzhen and Gao Hongye who have not been able to freely express their desire to return home and therefore have not been able to return. This proves that the U.S. government's persecution of Chinese people who want to return home has not stopped. The U.S. government recently stipulated that Chinese students who continue to reside in the United States must obtain Taiwanese entry permits. This is actually an attempt to cut off their hope of returning to mainland China and force them to either stay in the United States for a long time or go to Taiwan. This is a recent example of the U.S. government obstructing Chinese students from returning home and persecuting them.

    As one student's family member rightly said: "...Before our government discussed the issue of the return of civilians from both sides at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting, it even released American criminals serving sentences in our country ahead of schedule, but our innocent children are not allowed to return, which cannot but make us protest to the U.S. government." This is exactly the case. Since August 1st, of the 59 ordinary American nationals in China, 16 who applied to return home have been allowed to leave the country. Even among the 40 Americans who committed crimes, 27 have already been released. However, the U.S. government is still detaining thousands of Chinese students who want to return home. The contrast between the two clearly shows who is abiding by the agreement and who is violating the agreement.

    The U.S. State Department not long ago shamelessly stated that in the United States, "no Chinese person has ever been refused permission to leave." But this preposterous lie has long been exposed by the U.S. government itself, and now it has been exposed again by the countless facts provided by Chinese students. The facts of the U.S. government's obstruction of Chinese students returning home are all there and absolutely cannot be denied. This inhumane behavior of the U.S. government will inevitably be severely condemned by just world opinion. The U.S. government should now earnestly fulfill the agreement, immediately stop all acts of persecution against Chinese students, and allow them to return to their motherland and reunite with their families.

### 应当让在美国的中国留学生立即回国

    应当让在美国的中国留学生立即回国
    本报今天刊载了五封在美国的我国留学生的家属的信。这些信一致地控诉了美国政府阻挠他们的亲人回国的行为，要求美国政府让他们的亲人立即回到中国来和他们团聚。任何稍有正义感的人看了这些信，都不能不对他们迫切盼望的心情感到同情，并且对于美国政府阻挠中国留学生回国的行为感到愤慨。
    写这些信的人有的是年纪已经六十岁以上的父亲或母亲，有的是和丈夫离别了十年的妻子。有谁敢说他们要求同亲人团聚的愿望不应当迅速实现？然而铁的事实却告诉全世界，一向标榜人道主义的美国政府却正在做着违反人道的事情，硬要拆散成千个中国家庭，使它们不能团圆。
    仅仅从这五封信中就可以看出，美国政府为了阻挠中国留学生回国，对他们进行着各种各样的迫害。美国政府不但用判处五年徒刑、罚款两千美元等等卑鄙手段来威胁申请回国的中国留学生，甚至不让他们和家庭通信，不许他们表达自己要求回国的愿望。沈法淳、高鸿业长期没有给他们的家人写信，胡盛恩要求他的妻子在信中不要谈回国的问题，显然就是美国政府对他们进行迫害的结果。
    一直到现在，虽然中美两国大使级会谈在双方平民回国问题上达成协议已经三个多月了，但是冯元桢、俞娴士、高鸿业、刘安华、凌寒、胡盛恩、沈法淳这些人仍然没有能够回来。美方承认早就要求回国而长期被美国政府阻止不能离境的一百零三名中国人中，也还有三十八名没有回到中国。可以想见，还有数以千计的像冯元桢、高鸿业等这样的人没有能够自由地表达他们要求回国的愿望，因而没有能够回国。这就证明了美国政府对于要求回国的中国人的迫害并没有停止。美国政府最近规定继续居留在美国的中国学生必须取得台湾入境证。这实际上就是企图断绝他们归回中国大陆的希望，并且迫使他们要么长期留在美国，要么到台湾去。这就是美国政府阻挠中国留学生回国，对他们进行迫害的最近的一个例子。
    一位留学生的家属说得对：“……我国政府在中美大使级会议讨论双方平民回国问题以前，连在我国服刑的美国罪犯都提前释放了，而我们无罪的孩子却不得回来，这不能不使我们要对美国政府提出抗议。”事实正就是这样。从八月一日以来，在中国的五十九名一般美侨中，十六名申请回国的都获准离境。就是在四十名犯法的美国人中，也已经有二十七名被释放。而美国政府却仍然扣留着数以千计的要求回国的中国学生不放。两相对比，就清楚地说明了谁在遵守协议，谁在违反协议。
    美国国务院不久以前大言不惭地说，在美国，“一直没有一个中国人遭到拒绝而不能离去”。但是这个弥天大谎早已被美国政府自己所揭破，现在又被中国留学生们所提供的无数事实所揭破。美国政府阻挠中国留学生回国的事实俱在，是绝对抵赖不掉的。美国政府这种违反人道的行为必然要受到世界公正舆论的严厉谴责。美国政府现在应当切实履行协议，立即停止一切迫害中国留学生的行为，让他们回到他们的祖国，和他们的家人团聚。
