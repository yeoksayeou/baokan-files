Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th. Among the sixteen major products of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, fourteen exceeded their November plans. Among them, seamless steel tubes, medium and thick steel plates, small steel products, and steel ropes also completed their annual production plans.

In November, five more factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company completed their annual national plans. Together with the units that had already completed their annual plans in October, Anshan Iron and Steel Company now has nine factories and mines that have completed their annual plans.

This newspaper reports that national coal mines have exceeded the November production plan by producing more than 123,000 tons of raw coal. Lu'an, Zhalainuoer, Nanling, Xiangjiang, and Hua'an coal mines have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. As of the end of November, national coal mines have completed 92.2% of the annual plan, an increase of 15.68% compared to the same period last year. It is expected that national coal mines will increase production by more than one million tons of raw coal this year.

The outstanding achievement of coal mine production in November is that the production tasks were completed very evenly. The balanced production rate was 99.5% in the first ten days of the month; in the middle and last ten days of the month, it reached 100%, and overproduction increased day by day. The tunneling and total footage for preparing for coal mining also exceeded the plan.

The widespread and in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement in the coal mine system is the main reason for exceeding the production task in November. On the basis of the inter-mine rotating red flag competition in October, the Fushun Mining Bureau further launched a labor competition between mining areas and workshops. The Fuxin Mining Bureau organized workers to launch a competition, proposing guarantee conditions from the bottom up, and rewarded units that completed their tasks well in October, which further encouraged the production enthusiasm of workers. In terms of production management, various mines have tightened the organization of regular cyclical operations. The number of working faces completing regular cyclical operations in Longfeng and Laohutai mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau increased compared to October. The number of cycles completed by the coal mining working faces in the first half of November in the Fuxin Mining Bureau increased by 34% compared to the same period last month. In addition, many units have also implemented the economic accounting system and established and improved the work system of economic accounting for teams and groups.

    鞍钢已经有九个厂矿完成全年国家计划
    全国煤矿十一月份超额产煤十二万多吨
    新华社鞍山七日电　鞍山钢铁公司十六种主要产品中有十四种超额完成了十一月份的计划，其中无缝钢管、中厚钢板、小型钢材、钢绳还完成了全年的生产计划。
    在十一月份内，鞍山钢铁公司又有五个工厂完成了全年国家计划。连同在十月份就已经完成全年计划的单位，现在，鞍山钢铁公司已经有九个厂矿单位完成了全年计划。
    本报讯　全国各煤矿已超额完成十一月份的生产计划，多生产原煤十二万三千多吨。潞安、札赉诺尔、南岭、湘江、华安等煤矿已提前完成了全年生产计划。截至十一月底，全国各煤矿已完成全年计划的百分之九十二点二，比去年同时期提高了百分之十五点六八。预计今年全国煤矿将可增产一百多万吨原煤。
    十一月份煤矿生产的突出成绩是生产任务完成得很均衡。生产均衡率上旬为百分之九十九点五；中、下旬已达百分之百，并逐日超产。为采煤做准备工作的巷道掘进、总进尺等也都超额完成了计划。
    煤矿系统各单位增产节约运动的普遍深入展开，是十一月份超额完成生产任务的主要原因。抚顺矿务局在十月份矿际流动红旗竞赛的基础上，进一步展开了坑区、车间之间的劳动竞赛。阜新矿务局组织职工展开了竞赛，自下而上地提出保证条件，并对十月份完成任务较好的单位给予奖励，因而进一步鼓舞了职工的生产积极性。在生产管理方面，各矿抓紧了组织正规循环作业工作。抚顺矿务局所属龙凤、老虎台等矿完成正规循环作业的工作面都比十月份增加。阜新矿务局十一月上半月采煤工作面完成的循环数比上月同时期增加了百分之三十四。此外，很多单位还贯彻执行了经济核算制，建立和健全了班组经济核算的工作制度。鹤岗矿务局所属各矿经过定期召开班组核算会议，建立节约手册等措施，做到了人人心中有数，大大提高了工作效率。
