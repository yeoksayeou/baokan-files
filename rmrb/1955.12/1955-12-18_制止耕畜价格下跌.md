　　In the agricultural cooperation movement, one of the most important tasks is to protect draught animals and give full play to their role in agricultural production. However, since the beginning of winter, many areas have experienced a phenomenon of farmers selling draught animals in large numbers and a decline in their prices; the prices of female and young animals have fallen even more. In Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, livestock prices have fallen by an average of 30 to 40 percent compared with the same period last year; young livestock are even less valuable. Calves that sold for 20 to 30 yuan last year now sell for only 5 to 10 yuan. In some parts of Shanxi Province, the price of small livestock has fallen by two-thirds compared to normal prices. Similar phenomena have also occurred in some areas of Hebei and Henan. Some farmers and speculators, seeing that draught animal prices are too low, are trying every means to slaughter them indiscriminately. This phenomenon has affected farmers' enthusiasm for raising livestock and caused many undue losses to livestock.

　　Of course, the phenomenon of draught animals flowing into the market and the decline in livestock prices is not a very serious or widespread phenomenon in the current agricultural cooperation movement. The phenomenon of farmers buying cattle to join cooperatives, especially buying strong and good cattle, is the main and basic one. Moreover, many of the draught animals flowing into the market are old and weak and unusable. However, we must not therefore turn a blind eye to the above-mentioned phenomena. Even if these phenomena are occurring in a very small range, even if they are still in their infancy, we must give them sufficient attention. In the foreseeable future, draught animals will still be the main driving force in agricultural production in our country and an important source of farm manure. It can be said that without a large number of draught animals, there will be no developed agricultural production. Draught animals are easily damaged and reproduce very slowly, so we must pay attention at all times and protect them properly.

　　From individual farmers to agricultural cooperatives, tremendous changes have taken place in the relations of production, and many new problems will inevitably arise in the use and disposal of the means of production. Some agricultural cooperatives have a relative surplus of draught animals because they have more draught animals than before and have implemented unified management. Of course, some of them will flow into the market for a certain period. However, everyone should understand that our country's draught animals are not excessive now, but very insufficient; even if some agricultural cooperatives have a relative surplus of draught animals, it is only a temporary phenomenon. As long as some basic construction projects are gradually carried out and some sideline businesses are operated, the surplus draught animals will be useful. The Guangrao County Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the situation of all the draught animals owned by the county's agricultural cooperatives, comprehensively studied the masses' experience, and proposed a comprehensive arrangement for the agricultural cooperatives' draught animals: in each agricultural cooperative, make accurate calculations of farm work and draught cattle, and make a comprehensive arrangement and handling of large, small, strong, and weak draught animals in accordance with the plan for developing production, so that all types of draught animals can play a certain role. After such a unified arrangement according to the needs of further developing production, many agricultural cooperatives found that there was not only no surplus of draught animals, but also felt that they were insufficient and needed to add more. The Party Branch of Xiashenjie Township in Linxian County, Henan Province, led the township's farmers to do an accounting: the township's farmers need more than 79,500 livestock labor days for plowing fields, hauling coal, and grinding flour throughout the year; but now the township only has 563 head of livestock, which can only do more than 67,500 livestock labor days a year, a shortage of more than 11,900 livestock labor days, almost equivalent to 100 head of livestock. After such a calculation, many farmers who originally wanted to sell small livestock not only stopped selling them, but also drew up plans to breed and raise young livestock in large numbers. Of course, if there is a surplus of draught animals after proper arrangements, they can be adjusted in a unified and planned way. However, do not blindly allow draught animals to flow into the market. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province have set up cattle exchanges to operate draught animal trade in a planned way, so that the surplus and shortage of draught cattle can be adjusted, the market price of draught cattle can be stabilized, and the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter can be avoided. The commercial and supply and marketing departments of all provinces and counties should pay close attention to the local surplus and shortage of draught animals, strengthen the management of the draught animal market, and adjust strong livestock and eliminate old livestock in a planned way. The Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives should do a good job in the adjustment of draught animals between provinces and provinces (or autonomous regions).

　　Many newly established agricultural cooperatives assess the prices of draught animals entering the cooperatives according to the current market prices, and as a result, farmers with draught animals (mainly middle peasants) suffer losses. This issue should also be resolved. Draught animals have always had seasonal price differences, high in spring and low in winter, sometimes reaching 30 to 40 percent. It is certainly unreasonable to stipulate livestock prices or rents according to the lowest price. In some areas, such as Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, the rent for draught animals stipulated by the agricultural cooperatives newly established this autumn is 15 percent lower than the normal rent on the market, which is even more unreasonable. It is necessary to strictly implement the policy of mutual benefit, stipulate the price of draught animals entering the cooperatives according to the average market price throughout the year, and assess the rent according to the normal rent on the market. If both poor and middle peasants benefit, the livestock owners will naturally not sell draught animals at will. The agricultural cooperative in Lenghong Township, Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province, solved the problem of unfair depreciation of cattle entering the cooperative, and appropriately stipulated the rent for cattle. The members who wanted to sell cattle no longer sold them, and 30 members bought a lot of cattle.

　　The issue of protecting young livestock and small draught animals (donkeys, cattle, etc. that are relatively small) should also attract sufficient attention. Some leaders of agricultural cooperatives, in order to show the "superiority" of the cooperatives, and some members, in order to get more remuneration, are competing to buy large draught animals and use large draught animals, and are unwilling to have small draught animals and young livestock. According to a survey in Taikang County, Henan Province, more than 70 percent of the young livestock and small draught animals on the market are sold collectively by agricultural cooperatives or individually by farmers entering the cooperatives. It is necessary to tell all the members of agricultural cooperatives and the vast number of farmers that if everyone sells and kills young livestock, where can large draught animals be increased? If agricultural cooperatives do not raise small draught animals, what about things like members visiting relatives and pushing grinding mills? Agricultural cooperatives must adopt the most appropriate methods according to different situations to protect existing young livestock and small draught animals so that they can grow up quickly. Agricultural cooperatives that adopt the method of depreciating draught animals and assigning them to the cooperatives and the method of private ownership, public feeding, and public use should allow young livestock to enter the cooperatives with their mothers and be responsible for raising them well. After the young livestock grow up, the agricultural cooperatives and the livestock owners will share the profits reasonably. Agricultural cooperatives that adopt the method of private ownership, private feeding, and public use of draught animals should help members solve problems such as forage and feed so that members can feed both strong livestock and young livestock well at the same time. In addition, agricultural cooperatives should also help members overcome the feeding difficulties of young livestock that are raised and used by themselves. Counties in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, stipulate that agricultural cooperatives should distribute the surplus small livestock to members to raise alone or two or three households to raise together, or implement private ownership and public feeding, and distribute dividends proportionally after the livestock grow up. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in this prefecture have specifically established forage trading stations to help farmers adjust forage. As a result of a series of work, the surplus small livestock in agricultural cooperatives have been reasonably arranged.

　　Some areas have not left enough feed for young livestock in the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, which is also a reason why people are unwilling to raise more young livestock. This issue should be effectively resolved in accordance with the principle of encouraging the breeding of draught animals. When levying agricultural taxes, the tax amount should also be appropriately deducted for young livestock.

　　The problem of draught animals must be solved, and it is not difficult to solve. As the saying goes: "A draught cattle is half the sky." As long as the various policies related to draught animals are implemented steadily, and the specific methods for the purchase, sale, and adjustment of draught animals are reasonably stipulated, which farmer is willing to damage his own draught animals? The problem now is only whether the leading organs at all levels can take effective measures in a timely manner to curb the decline in draught animal prices. Everyone knows that small problems that are not corrected will develop into big problems; in this regard, many experiences and lessons require us to remember them. The issue of draught animals is a major issue in agricultural production in our country. Any area that relaxes its vigilance may make big mistakes and must not be negligent.

### 制止耕畜价格下跌

    制止耕畜价格下跌
  　在农业合作化运动中，最重要的任务之一是保护耕畜，充分发挥耕畜在农业生产中的作用。但是，入冬以来，不少地区发生了农民大量出卖耕畜和耕畜价格下跌的现象；母畜和幼畜的价格跌的更多。山东省胶州专区牲畜价格平均比去年同期降低百分之三十到四十；幼小牲畜更不值钱，去年卖二、三十元的牛犊，现在只卖五元到十元。山西省有些地方的小牲畜的价格，比常年价格降低三分之二。河北、河南若干地区，也发生了类似的现象。有些农民和投机商贩看见耕畜价格过低，就想尽办法滥宰耕畜。这种现象影响了农民喂养牲畜的积极性，使牲畜受到了许多不应有的损失。
    当然，耕畜流入市场和畜价下跌的现象，在当前的农业合作化运动中，并不是很严重、很普遍的现象。农民买牛入社、特别是买壮牛、好牛入社的现象，是主要的和基本的。而且流入市场的耕畜，有许多都是老弱不堪使用的。但是，我们决不可以因此就对上述现象听之任之。那怕这些现象是在很小的范围内发生的，甚至它还处在萌芽状态，也必须给以足够的注意。在今后相当长的时期内，耕畜仍然是我国农业生产上的主要动力，也是农家肥料的重要来源。可以说，没有大量的耕畜，就没有发达的农业生产。耕畜容易受到毁坏，繁殖又很缓慢，更要随时注意，妥为保护。
    从个体农民到农业合作社，生产关系发生了极大的变化，在生产资料的使用和处理上，必然产生许多新的问题。某些农业合作社因为原有耕畜较多，又实行了统一经营，在一定的时期，耕畜相对地有了剩余，其中当然有一部分要流入市场。但是，大家应该明白，我国的耕畜现在不是过多，而是很不够用；即使某些农业合作社的耕畜相对地过剩了，那也是暂时的现象。只要逐步地把某些基本建设搞起来，把某些副业经营起来，剩余的耕畜都会有用处。中共广饶县委分析了全县农业合作社所有的耕畜的情况，综合研究了群众的经验，对农业合作社的耕畜提出了全面安排的办法：在各个农业合作社中把农活和耕牛作出精确的计算，按照发展生产的计划，把大的、小的、强的、弱的耕畜加以全面的安排和处理，使各类耕畜都发挥一定的作用。这样根据进一步发展生产的需要统一安排以后，许多农业合作社发现耕畜不但没有多余，而且感到不足，需要再增添一些。河南省林县下申街乡党支部领导全乡农民算了一笔账：全乡的农民全年耕种田地和拉煤、磨面共需要用七万九千五百多个畜工；而现在全乡只有五百六十三头牲口，一年只能做六万七千五百多个畜工，还缺一万一千九百多个畜工，差不多等于一百头牲口。经过这样一算，有许多本来想卖掉小牲口的农民，不但不再卖了，而且订出了大量繁殖和喂养幼畜的计划。当然，如果耕畜在经过适当安排以后还有剩余，可以进行统一的有计划的调剂。但是，决不要盲目地使耕畜流入市场。湖南省许多供销合作社设立了耕牛交易所，有计划地经营耕畜贸易，使耕牛的余缺得到调剂，稳定了耕牛的市场价格，避免了胡乱宰杀的现象。各省各县的商业和供销合作部门，都应当密切注意本地耕畜的余缺情况，加强耕畜市场的管理工作，有计划地调剂壮畜，淘汰老畜。商业部和全国供销合作总社，应当把省和省（或自治区）之间的耕畜调剂工作做好。
    许多新建立的农业合作社按照目前的市场价格评定入社耕畜价格，结果，有耕畜的农民（主要是中农）吃了亏。这一问题也应当加以解决。耕畜历来就有季节差价，春季高、冬季低，幅度有时达到百分之三、四十。按照最低价格规定畜价或租金，当然很不合理。有些地区，例如江苏省吴江县，今年秋季新建的农业合作社规定的耕畜租金，比社会上正常的租额还低百分之十五，那就更不合理了。必须严格执行互利政策，按照全年市场平均价格，规定耕畜入社价格，按照社会上正常的租额评定租金。做到贫农、中农两利，畜主自然不会随意出卖耕畜了。江苏仪征县冷红乡的农业合作社解决了入社耕牛折价不公的问题，适当地规定了耕牛的租金，哪些想卖耕牛的社员都不卖了，有三十个社员还买进不少耕牛。
    保护幼畜和小耕畜（个子比较小的驴、牛等）的问题，也应该引起人们充分的注意。有些农业合作社的领导人员为了显示社的“优越性”，有些社员为了多得报酬，争着买大耕畜，用大耕畜，而不愿要小耕畜和幼畜。据河南省太康县调查，上市的幼畜和小耕畜中，百分之七十以上是农业合作社集体出卖或入社农民个别出卖的。一定要告诉所有的农业合作社社员和广大农民，如果大家都把幼畜卖了，杀了，哪里还能增加大耕畜？农业合作社如果不养小耕畜，像社员走亲戚、推碾磨等等事情怎么办呢？农业合作社必须按照不同的情况，采取最妥当的办法，保护现有的幼畜和小耕畜，使它们很快地长大。采用耕畜折价归社办法和私有公养公用办法的农业合作社，要让幼畜随同母畜入社，并且要负责把它们养好。幼畜长大以后，农业合作社和畜主合理分益。采取耕畜私有私养公用办法的农业合作社，应该帮助社员解决饲草饲料等问题，使社员能够把壮畜和幼畜同时喂好。此外，农业合作社还要帮助社员克服自养自用的幼畜的饲养困难。河南省许昌专区各县规定由农业合作社把多余的小牲口分给社员独自喂养或两三户合伙喂养，或者实行私有公养，等到牲口长大以后，按比例分红。这个专区有不少供销合作社专门成立了饲草交易站，帮助农民调剂饲草。由于进行了一系列的工作，农业合作社里多余的小牲口都得到了合理的安排。
    有些地区在粮食统购统销工作中没有给幼畜留下足够的饲料，这也是人们不愿意多养幼畜的一个原因。应当按照鼓励繁殖耕畜的原则，对这个问题切实加以解决。在征收农业税的时候，对幼畜也要适当地扣除税额。
    耕畜问题必须解决，也不难解决。俗语说：“一条耕牛半个天。”只要有关耕畜的各种政策执行得稳当，关于耕畜的买卖、调剂等具体办法规定的合情合理，哪个农民肯毁坏自己的耕畜？现在的问题只在于各级领导机关是不是能够及时采取有效的办法，制止耕畜价格下跌。谁都知道，小问题不纠正，就会发展成大问题；在这方面，多少经验教训，要求我们切实记取。耕畜问题是我国农业生产中的一个大问题，哪个地区放松警惕，都可能犯大错误，万万疏忽不得。
