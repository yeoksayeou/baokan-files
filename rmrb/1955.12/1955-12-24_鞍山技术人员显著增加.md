The technical force of Anshan, the steel capital of the motherland, is growing rapidly. Currently, there are 7,683 engineers and technicians working in Anshan, equivalent to 330% of the number of engineers and technicians in 1950. Many outstanding technical personnel have also honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Since 1950, more than 200 of the 1,939 young engineers and technicians at the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company have become Communist Party members. Many technical personnel, after years of training, have become the backbone of Anshan's technical force. Currently, 32 technical personnel in the city serve as factory directors or company managers. Another 581 engineers and technicians hold leading positions in construction sites, workshops, and other departments. Among the 144 assistant engineers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, more than 80% have been trained from university graduates assigned to work there since liberation. In order to strengthen the training of technical personnel, the state has sent many technical personnel in Anshan to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries for further study. In recent years, large-scale, seamless, steelmaking, and other factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have sent 88 technical personnel to study abroad. Currently, 64 students have completed their studies and returned to the country to participate in the construction of Anshan.

    鞍山技术人员显著增加
    祖国钢都鞍山的技术力量成长很快。目前在鞍山工作的工程技术人员已经有七千六百八十三名，等于一九五零年工程技术人员的百分之三百三十。许多优秀的技术人员并光荣地参加了中国共产党。一九五零年以来，鞍山钢铁建设公司一千九百三十九名青年工程技术人员中，先后已有二百余人成为共产党员。很多技术人员经过几年来的锻炼，已经成为鞍山技术力量的骨干，现在全市有三十二名技术人员担任了厂矿长或公司经理。还有五百八十一名工程技术人员担任了工地、车间以及其他部门的领导职务。在鞍山钢铁公司一百四十四名助理工程师中，有百分之八十以上是从解放以来分配工作的大学生中培养起来的。国家为了加强对技术人员的培养，许多在鞍山的技术人员被送往苏联和人民民主国家继续深造。几年来，鞍钢大型、无缝、炼钢等工厂曾派出了八十八名技术人员去国外学习，目前已经有六十四名学员学成归国，参加了鞍山的建设。
