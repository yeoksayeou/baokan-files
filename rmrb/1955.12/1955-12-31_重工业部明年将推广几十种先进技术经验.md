Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: The Ministry of Heavy Industry plans to systematically promote dozens of international new technologies, mainly from the Soviet Union, and advanced domestic technology experiences in various factories and mines in 1956. This is a major measure taken to ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry plans to promote eight major advanced technology experiences in mining and ore dressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals in 1956. Among them, new mining methods, cemented carbide drill bits, and wet rock drilling will be adopted in mining. The promotion of these advanced technologies can increase China's metal mines' ore recovery rate by about 15%, gradually reaching the level of the Soviet Union. After changing the drill bits of rock drills from carbon steel to cemented carbide steel, the drilling efficiency can be increased by 36% to 45%. After the implementation of heavy medium ore separation, granular flotation, and the use of automatic chutes in ore dressing, the metal recovery rate of ore dressing can be significantly improved, and symbiotic metals in minerals can be recovered.

The iron and steel, non-ferrous metal smelting, and rolling departments plan to promote more than 20 major new technologies next year. After the ironmaking industry promotes new technologies such as ore blending, self-fluxing sintered ore, and steam blowing, the national pig iron production can be increased by about 15%. The steel production department plans to promote new technologies such as open hearth rapid steelmaking, new hearth bottom patching method, electric furnace oxygen steelmaking, chrome-magnesia brick and high-alumina brick furnace roofs next year. According to preliminary estimates, after these new technologies are universally implemented in the future, the national steel production can be increased by hundreds of thousands of tons. The new technical experiences such as the use of bakelite bearings in rolling mills, the mechanization of the rolling process, and the hot charging method, which the steel rolling department plans to promote, are of great significance for saving fuel, increasing steel production, and improving workers' working conditions. The non-ferrous metal smelting department plans to promote new technical experiences such as fluidized roasting, increasing current density, and comprehensive utilization of metals.

The building materials industry and the chemical industry department also plan to promote many new technical experiences in 1956. After the cement production department promotes advanced technologies such as long-term safe operation of cement kilns, body water cooling, and rapid rotary kilns, the country can increase cement production by hundreds of thousands of tons each year. After some chemical fertilizer plants plan to promote new catalysts, the production of nitrogen fertilizer can be increased by about 30%.

In the past few years, many production enterprises of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have adopted these advanced technical experiences. Facts have proved that units that have conscientiously implemented these advanced technical experiences have greatly improved their production levels. In the past, the various units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry also had many shortcomings in promoting advanced technical experiences. At the recent scientific experiment and research work conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, a two-year technology development plan was formulated, and it was decided to vigorously strengthen scientific experiment and research work. At the same time, each industrial system has also recently begun to formulate plans to promote new technical experiences. In this way, the systematic promotion of advanced technical experiences by various production units next year will have many favorable conditions.

### 重工业部明年将推广几十种先进技术经验

    重工业部明年将推广几十种先进技术经验
    新华社三十日讯　重工业部计划在一九五六年内，有系统地在各厂矿中推广几十种以苏联为主的国际新技术和国内的先进技术经验。这是为保证提前完成五年计划所采取的一项重大措施。
    重工业部计划在黑色金属和有色金属的采矿、选矿方面，一九五六年内推广八种重大的先进技术经验。其中在采矿方面将采用新采矿法、硬质合金钎头、湿式凿岩等先进技术。这些先进技术的推广，可以使我国金属矿山提高矿石回采率百分之十五左右，逐步达到苏联的水平。把凿岩机钎头由炭素钢改为硬质合金钢以后，就可以提高凿岩效率百分之三十六到四十五。在选矿方面推行重介质选矿法、粒浮选矿法和采用自动流槽等以后，可以显著地提高选矿金属收得量，并且可以回收矿物中的共生金属。
    钢铁、有色金属冶炼和轧制部门，计划在明年推广的重大新技术共有二十多种。炼铁工业部门推广矿石混匀、自熔性烧结矿和蒸汽鼓风等新技术以后，能够使全国的生铁产量增加百分之十五左右。炼钢生产部门计划在明年推广平炉快速炼钢、新烧补炉底法、电炉氧气炼钢、铬镁砖和高铝砖炉顶等新技术。据初步估计，这些新技术在今后普遍推行后，可使全国钢的产量增加几十万吨。轧钢部门计划推广的轧钢机使用胶木轴瓦、轧钢过程机械化、热装炉法等新的技术经验，对于节约燃料、增加钢材产量和改善工人劳动条件等方面，都有很大意义。有色金属冶炼部门计划推广沸腾焙烧、提高电流密度、金属综合利用等新的技术经验。
    建筑材料工业和化学工业部门，计划在一九五六年推广的新技术经验也有很多种。水泥生产部门推广水泥窑长期安全运转、胴体水冷却、快速转窑等先进技术以后，全国每年就可以增产几十万吨水泥。化学肥料部门有些厂计划推广新触媒剂以后，使氮肥的产量提高百分之三十左右。
    过去几年来，重工业部的不少生产企业采用了这些先进的技术经验。事实证明：凡是认真推行这些先进技术经验的单位，生产水平都有很大的提高。重工业部所属各单位过去在推广先进技术经验中，也还存在着很多缺点。最近在重工业部召开的科学试验研究工作会议上，制定了今后两年技术发展规划，并且决定大力加强科学试验研究工作。同时，各产业系统最近也都分别开始制定推广新技术经验的计划。这样，各生产单位明年有系统地推广先进技术经验，就有了很多有利的条件。
