The Wujiaqiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Dong'an County, Hunan Province, has been fully utilizing rural private merchants and peddlers to acquire a large number of minor local and special products since entering the peak season. In October, this supply and marketing cooperative only purchased 75 main varieties of products, but by mid-November, this number had increased to 90. The purchase amount from November 10th to 15th increased by 185% compared to the previous five days. In order to better utilize private merchants and peddlers, they held a meeting with 22 oil pressing workshops, signing a contract to process 40,000 jin of tung oil. They also promptly mobilized farmers to send tung seeds for pressing, averaging more than 1,000 jin of tung oil purchased daily. The District Supply and Marketing Cooperative also held meetings with hunters and butchers, signing contracts to purchase 800 animal hides and a batch of hog casings and pig bristles. In addition, they organized two shopkeepers and three private peddlers to go to the countryside with the supply and marketing cooperative's peddlers to make purchases.

The method of using private merchants and peddlers to purchase minor local and special products is very good. Because minor local and special products are scattered in the countryside, some even in remote areas, and the quantity is not large. Farmers rarely take scattered local and special products to the supply and marketing cooperative to sell. By signing contracts with private merchants and organizing private peddlers to go to the countryside to make purchases, they can utilize their ability to purchase extensively and sell widely, expand purchasing operations, maintain their livelihoods, facilitate farmers' sale of local and special products, and increase farmers' income, truly achieving three gains with one action.

    一举三得
    湖南省东安县伍家桥区供销合作社从进入旺季以来，充分利用了农村私商小贩，收购了大量小土产、特产品。这个供销合作社十月份收购的主要品种只有七十五种，十一月中旬就增加到九十种，十一月十日至十五日的收购金额比前五天上升百分之一百八十五。为了更好地利用私商小贩，他们曾召开了二十二个油榨坊的业主会，签订了加工四万斤桐油的合同，还及时发动农民送桐籽去榨，每天平均能收购桐油一千多斤。区供销合作社还通过召开猎户会、屠户会，签订了收购八百张兽皮和一批猪肠衣、猪鬃的合同。此外，组织了二户座商、三户私商货郎担随供销社货郎担下乡收购。
    利用私商小贩收购小土产、特产品的办法是很好的。因为小土产、特产品都分散在农村，有的甚至在偏僻的地区，而且数量也不大。农民很少会把零碎的土产、特产品拿到供销社去出卖。通过和私商签订合同，组织私商小贩下乡收购，既可以利用他们能深购远销的特点，扩大收购业务，又可以维持他们的生活和便利农民出卖土产、特产品，增加农民收入，真是一举三得。
