To Antarctica

--An Interview with Somov, Head of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition and Doctor of Geography
A. Volga, Soviet Union

I arrived at the headquarters of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition. People of various ages, their faces roughened by the fierce northern winds, were busily engaged in important tasks. Some were deeply engrossed in compiling documents, others were heatedly discussing something, and some polar workers came in to receive brief instructions before quickly leaving the office.

All these threads of intense activity converged on a lean man with closely cropped, grizzled hair and piercing eyes. He greeted visitors standing, sometimes walking over to one group, sometimes to another. It was clear how his concise instructions were guiding everything that was happening around him.

This man was Mikhail Somov, Doctor of Geography and head of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition. He is forty-seven years old. For seventeen years he has been a regular participant in Soviet Arctic expeditions. Somov has spent about ten years of his life on the Arctic ice. From 1950 to 1952, he was the leader of the "North Pole-2" drifting scientific station and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for this.

14 Million Square Kilometers of Ice

"Our generation knows the Arctic very well, but the scientific data about the Antarctic region is still very scarce," said Somov. "Antarctica is distributed within the 60th parallel south latitude, and its center is the continent – Antarctica."

"This vast polar region has an average elevation of more than 2,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level, with some peaks as high as 6,000 meters. Almost the entire surface of Antarctica is covered with a fixed continental ice sheet, up to 2,000 meters thick. Here and there, one can see some mountain peaks and small patches of land not covered by ice.

"The ice sheet covering the land extends into the ocean in the form of ice tongues, forming the so-called ice shelves. Their scope is enormous: the Shackleton Ice Shelf, where our expedition is working, is 350 kilometers wide and about the same length. The Ross Ice Barrier extends 800 kilometers from west to east and about 700 kilometers from south to north. The ice armor enclosing the entire Antarctic covers an area of 14 million square kilometers. It concentrates seven-eighths of the modern ground ice cover.

"The sixth continent of our planet is uninhabited, and animals and plants are also very scarce. It is the coldest and most uncomfortable corner of the earth. In some places along the coast of Antarctica, the average annual air temperature is minus 25 degrees Celsius. Winter temperatures are about minus 60 to 70 degrees Celsius, and wind speeds in some places reach 90 to 100 meters per second."

The Labor of Great Explorers for 135 Years

"But the cold, inaccessible Antarctic land attracts scientists from all over the world," Somov continued. "A series of physical phenomena occur here, the impact of which can be felt by all countries of the Old and New Worlds. Antarctica is rich in mineral resources. Even a focused survey of the most accessible areas of Antarctica has already revealed iron and copper, zinc and lead, gold and silver, graphite, and huge coal deposits – perhaps the largest on Earth.

"The limited material about Antarctica has been obtained by the immense labor of scientists from various countries over the past 135 years! As we prepare to set sail for the coast of Antarctica, we recall their glorious names with deep respect. First of all, we must remember our compatriots Bellingshausen and Lazarev, who, on January 16, 1821, sailing in two small sailing ships, the 'Vostok' and the 'Mirny,' first discovered the edge of the Antarctic continent at 69 degrees 22 minutes south latitude and 2 degrees 15 minutes west longitude. We also respect the work of the explorers of the last century: the Englishmen Biscoe and Ross, the Frenchman Dumont d'Urville, the American Wilkes, and the first man to winter on the Antarctic continent, the Norwegian Borchgrevink. We also pay tribute to the Norwegian Amundsen, the first to reach the South Pole, and the Englishman Scott, who reached the South Pole after the Norwegians, and who perished on the return journey due to exhaustion and hunger, along with his four companions."

A World Plan of Scientific Work

Somov continued, "Our expedition will solve the tasks stipulated by the general scientific work plan of the International Geophysical Year activities.

"Each country's expedition will conduct various explorations, observations, and surveys in specific areas, including oceanography, meteorology, aerology, geomagnetism, etc. These activities will not be some new activity, not scientific work that has never been done before, but a continuation of the regularly conducted work of studying nature. But scientists from almost all countries of the world will simultaneously carry out these activities across the entire Earth, including those hard-to-reach areas. And this comprehensive study of physical phenomena will open up the broadest prospects for understanding their essence!"

"What results are you most interested in expecting?" I asked.

"There are many. For example, it may be possible to clarify the regularity of air currents across the entire Earth, which is currently unknown. And this will enable scientists to make more accurate long-term weather forecasts for the entire Earth."

"It is also possible to study the intensity of magnetic variations, the characteristics of storms in the South Magnetic Pole region, and their connection with similar phenomena in the North Magnetic Pole," said Korotkevich, the deputy director of the Arctic Scientific Research Institute and one of the participants in the preparation work for the Antarctic expedition.

"It will also be interesting for the first time to simultaneously observe the aurora borealis and australis near the North and South Poles," he continued. "Finally, geographical and geological materials about Antarctica will be compiled. And this will be a new page in the world's geographical history. Almost the entire Antarctic continent has not been studied, and the area we are going to explore can be said with full reason to have never been discovered."

"I was just about to ask about the situation in your expedition's area," I said.

The Coast of Wilhelm II Land and Queen Mary Land

Mikhail Somov stood up and walked over to a huge map of Antarctica hanging on the wall.

He pointed to the very top of the map with a pencil and said, "You see, here, a large part of the coastline is drawn with dots. This means that it is still only a hypothesis. Many places here have never been visited. Only a few ships have approached these shores bordering the Davis Sea."

Where he was pointing was written: "Wilhelm II Land," "Queen Mary Land."

"This part of the Antarctic coast from 80 degrees east longitude to 105 degrees east longitude has been assigned to the Soviet expedition by the International Geophysical Year Special Committee for exploration," Somov continued. "In this thousand-kilometer-long coastal zone, we have to find a place to land and establish the main coastal base.

"Where this base will be is currently unknown to anyone. It is possible that a suitable site will be found in the first few days of coastal exploration, within the first few kilometers, or it may be necessary to sail back and forth along the coast for a long time before it is selected.

"Of course, we will strive to land in a sheltered harbor, on a small piece of ice-free land..."

"What if you can't find one?" I asked.

"Then we will prepare to land on the ice. We will establish our base on the ice."

"But doesn't the continental ice slowly move – 'flow' into the sea?"

"Yes," Somov affirmed. "And sometimes their speed is quite high. It has been found that the 'Little America' base, established in 1923 by American explorers on the Ross Sea ice shelf, was carried into the ocean by the ice. Therefore, the selection of strongholds must be carefully considered and prudently carried out.

"But first, it is necessary to get close to the shore, and this will also be a very complex task. The waters off this coast are filled with sea ice. There are also huge icebergs floating around. Some icebergs weigh millions of tons. The Soviet 'Slava' whaling fleet once saw an entire ice island, 22 kilometers long and 6 kilometers wide. Once, they encountered nearly a thousand icebergs in an hour of sailing. Obviously, in such a situation, we will encounter them hundreds of kilometers from the shore."

"Please tell me about your route and the expedition's ships!" I requested.

Sailing 20,000 Kilometers

"Our main ship, the diesel-electric ship 'Ob,' participated in scientific exploration work as early as a year ago," Somov said. "During this time, it has been to sixteen seas, passed through the Northern Sea Route in the shortest period, and demonstrated its advantages in icy areas.

"The 'Ob' has a displacement of 12,600 tons, and its four cargo holds can hold 6,000 tons of cargo. To supplement the existing cabins, new cabins are being fitted on board for the expedition members and scientific laboratories.

"The ship is equipped with radio direction-finding equipment, which can identify ice conditions at long distances. It is equipped with the latest instruments and equipment for oceanographic work. It also has deep-water winches that can obtain samples of water, soil, and seabed animals from any depth that may be encountered.

"After the 'Ob' transports the expedition's land personnel to the Antarctic coast to land, the expedition's maritime personnel will engage in oceanographic exploration work. This work will be led by my scientific deputy, Professor Kort, Director of the Institute of Oceanography of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Doctor of Geography.

"The diesel-electric ship 'Lena,' of the same type, will set off with the 'Ob.' After unloading, it will sail back to the motherland. To transport perishable food to the expedition, a refrigerated ship will accompany us or arrive later.

"We are more than 20,000 kilometers away from our destination. We will pass through the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, enter the Atlantic Ocean, and travel along the zero meridian at a speed of thirteen miles per hour, without stopping along the way. It is estimated that it will take forty-five days and nights after departure to enter the waters off the Antarctic continent.

"You asked about the composition of the expedition. There will be more than a hundred people, including the expedition's maritime personnel. Many of them are seasoned polar workers who have been trained in the harsh Arctic 'school.' Some of the workers from the 'North Pole-2,' 'North Pole-3,' and 'North Pole-4' drifting scientific stations will also be traveling with us."

"Now, please tell me more about the expedition's equipment," I said.

A Scientific Town on Antarctica

"In our ship's holds," Somov continued, "we will transport an entire village. It will consist of more than twenty residential and working houses, as well as special buildings such as power stations, parking lots, repair shops, and warehouses.

"The residential houses are installed from prefabricated panels with reliable insulation equipment. The structure of the houses will make them very airtight. Electrical and plumbing systems will ensure warmth. Each house has a living area of 46 square meters, accommodating about eight or nine people.

"These basic houses are intended for the village of the main base. For the other two bases to be established in the South Magnetic Pole region and the so-called inaccessible polar region of Antarctica, goods can only be transported there by air. We brought twenty special lightweight Shaposhnikov-type mobile houses like those used in Arctic drifting stations. This type of house has an area of 12.5 square meters and a total weight of just over one ton. Any of its components is light enough for one person to lift. Aircraft or helicopters can freely transport these houses, and the time to equip them will not exceed two or three hours."

"What kind of transportation will the expedition have?" I asked.

"First of all, an air transport team. This is its captain, Comrade Cherevichny," Somov said, pointing to a robust man with the Gold Star Medal of Hero of the Soviet Union on his chest. "Our air transport team will have several transport aircraft and helicopters.

"The expedition's land transport will include powerful tractors, new brands of off-road vehicles, and wheeled vehicles that have been used very successfully in the Arctic. We will also have floating vehicles – speedboats and motorboats. Finally, we will have four sets of dog sleds."

"What will the expedition members wear and eat?" I asked with great interest.

"We are carrying more than 500 tons of food, clothing, and household equipment," Somov continued. "Everything has been considered in advance to ensure that the people who overwinter have convenient living conditions.

"Soviet industry has prepared windproof clothing made of special waterproof fabrics for the expedition. Warm eiderdown coats can protect people from the Antarctic cold. We also have leather and fur clothing, and sleeping bags made of camel hair and eiderdown. The people who overwinter will wear fur boots and fur socks, and warm rubber and leather boots and shoes.

"The canning industry has prepared new varieties of canned food for the expedition.

"The refrigerated ship will transport fresh frozen meat, dumplings, birds, and a total of 80 tons of cabbage, potatoes, and other fresh vegetables to our base. To preserve these things, a cold-proof warehouse will be built at the base.

"We will also transport various refined foods to mobile working groups, including the constant refined food 'Pemmican,' which contains dehydrated meat, milk, and eggs. Just a small ball of this food, weighing 300 grams, can sustain a person's needs for a day and night."

"Do you think it is possible to find food locally?"

"Although Antarctic animals are scarce, there are fish, penguins, and seals there, and their meat is edible. We will hunt them. At the same time, we will also carry fishing gear."

Finally, Mikhail Somov said:

"Scientific exploration is interesting and fascinating. It is gratifying not only that I, such an old—I dare to say—participant in Arctic research work, have the opportunity to go to the other end of the Earth. Moreover, an important feature of this expedition is the close scientific cooperation of scientists from various countries. Scientists from the United Kingdom and Belgium, New Zealand and Norway, Chile and Japan, Argentina and France will be working with us in Antarctica. To our west, not far from us, Australians will be working there, and to our east, the American expedition will be our close neighbor. I believe that we will be good neighbors."

As I said goodbye and came out, I said to them: "Dear comrades, I wish you a safe journey and a victorious return!" (Attached picture)

    到南极去
    ——苏联南极考察队队长、地理学博士索莫夫访问记
    苏联阿·沃尔加
    我来到了苏联南极探险队的总部。被剧烈的北风吹粗了脸孔的、各种不同年龄的人们，正在忙碌着重要的事务。有些人在埋头编制文件，另一些人在热烈地讨论着什么事情，有的极地工作者进来接受了简短的指示，然后又很快地离开了办公室。
    所有这些紧张的活动的线索，都会合到了一个有着剪得很短的斑白头发、目光炯炯的瘦长的人身上。他站着接见来访者，有时走到这一群人，有时走到另一群人那里。看得出来，他的简洁的指示在怎样指导着周围发生的一切事情。
    这个人就是地理学博士、苏联南极考察队的队长米哈伊尔·索莫夫。他已四十七岁。十七年来他一直是苏联北极考察队的经常参加者。索莫夫约有十年的生活是在北极的冰上度过的。在一九五○到一九五二年间，他是“北极—二号”漂流科学站领导人，并因此而被授予苏联英雄的称号。
    一千四百万平方公里的冰块
    “我们这一代人对北极是很了解的，但是关于南极地区的科学资料却还是非常贫乏。”索莫夫说，“南极分布在南纬六十度线以内，它的中心是大陆——南极洲。”
    “这一块广袤的极地，平均拔海二千到三千公尺以上，有的山峰高达六千公尺。几乎整个南极洲的表面都覆盖着固定的大陆冰的冰层，厚度达到两千公尺。在这里间或能够看到一些山峰和未被冰层覆盖着的小块土地。
    “覆盖陆地的冰层，以其冰舌进入大洋，形成了所谓陆棚冰河。它们的范围是巨大的：我们考察队所工作的地段舍柯尔顿冰河的宽度有三百五十公里，长度也差不多。罗斯冰障从西到东延伸八百公里，从南到北延伸约七百公里。封闭着整个南极洲的冰甲面积达一千四百万平方公里。这里集中着现代地面覆冰层的八分之七。
    “我们这个行星的第六大洲没有人居住，动物和植物也是非常稀少的。这是地球上最冷和最不舒服的一角。南极洲沿岸的空气的温度有的地方每年平均为零下二十五度。这里寒冬的温度约零下六十到七十度，风的速度有的地方达到每秒钟九十到一百公尺。”
    伟大探险家们一百三十五年来的劳动
    “但是严寒的、难以接近的南极土地吸引着全世界的科学家。”索莫夫继续说，“这里发生着一系列的物理现象，它们的影响可以被新旧大陆的所有国家都感觉得到。南极洲的矿藏是很丰富的。即使对南极洲上最容易到达的地区作有重点的勘测，就已经发现铁和铜，锌和铅，金和银，石墨和巨大的煤炭矿藏——也许是地球上最大的。
    “关于南极洲的不多的材料，是各国科学家们一百三十五年来用巨大的劳动获得的！在准备启程前往南极洲的沿岸时，我们怀着深深的敬意来回忆起他们的光荣的名字。我们首先要回想起我们的同胞别林斯高津和拉扎列夫，他们在一八二一年一月十六日乘了两艘不大的帆船‘东方号’和‘和平号’，在南纬六十九度二十二分和西经二度十五分处首先发现了南极大陆的边缘。我们也尊重上一世纪的探险家们的劳动。他们是：英国人比斯柯和罗斯，法国人久芒·久尔维尔，美国人维尔克斯，以及在南极大陆上过冬的第一个人、挪威人包尔赫克列文柯。我们也对第一个到达南极顶点的挪威人阿蒙德森和在挪威人之后到达南极顶点的英国人斯高脱表示敬意，后者和他的四个同伴在归途中由于疲惫和饥饿而牺牲了。”
    科学工作的世界计划
    索莫夫继续说，“我们的考察队将要解决由国际地球物理学年度活动的总的科学工作计划所规定的任务。
    “每一个国家的考察队要在一定的地区进行各种探测，观察，在海洋学、气象学、空气学、地理学、地磁学等方面的考察等。这些活动将不是某种新的活动，不是从前没有进行过的科学工作，这是经常进行的研究自然的工作的继续。但是几乎全世界各国的科学家都将同时在整个地球进行这些活动，包括那些难以到达的地区在内。而这种全盘的物理现象的研究工作，将会打开认识它们的本质的最广阔的远景！”
    “你们期待着哪些最有兴趣的结果呢？”我问。
    “那是很多的。例如，可能搞清楚现在尚未知道的整个地球上的空气流动的规律性。而这将使科学家能够对整个地面上的天气作较准确的长期预测。”
    “还有可能研究磁性变化的强度，南磁极地区的风暴的特点，和它们同北磁极的类似现象的联系”，北极科学研究所的副所长、南极考察队准备工作的参加者之一科罗特盖维奇这样说。
    “第一次能够在靠近南北极地的地方同时观察极光也是很有趣的，”他继续说道，“最后，还要编写南极洲的地理和地质材料。而这在世界地理史上还是新的篇页。整个南极大陆几乎还没有研究过，而我们要去考察的地区，也可以有充分的根据说是从来还没有被发现的。”
    “我正想问问你们的考察队的地区的情形呢。”我说。
    威廉第二地和马利皇后地沿岸
    米哈伊尔·索莫夫站了起来，走近挂在墙上的巨幅南极地图。
    他用铅笔指着地图的最上边说：“你看，在这里，海岸线有很大一部分是用点来画成的。这就是说，它还只是在假定中。这里有很多地方从来没有人到过。只有少数的船只靠近过濒临台维斯海的这些岸边。”
    在他指点着的地方写着：“威廉第二地”，“马利皇后地”。
    “南极洲沿岸从东经八十度到一百零五度的这一部分地区，国际地球物理学专门委员会划归苏联考察队进行探测”，索莫夫继续说，“在这一千公里长的沿岸地带，我们要寻找一块地方来登陆和建立主要的沿岸基地。
    “这个基地将在什么地方，现在是谁也不知道的。可能在沿岸考察的最初几天，在最初的几公里内就找到适宜的地点，也可能在选定以前要沿着海岸来往驶行很久。
    “当然，我们将力求在有屏障的港口，在一小块没有冰的土地上登陆。……”
    “如果找不到呢？”我问。
    “那时我们就准备在冰上登陆。我们将在冰上建立自己的基地。”
    “但是大陆冰不是会慢慢地移到——‘流到’海里去吗？”
    “是的”，索莫夫肯定地说，“而且有时候它们的速度是相当大的，现已查明，一九二三年美国探险家在罗斯海沿岸冰河上建立的‘小亚美利加’基地，就被冰块带到大洋里去了。因此，选择据点必须要深思熟虑和谨慎从事。
    “但是最初必须靠近岸边，而这也将是一项十分复杂的任务。这个岸边的海水里充塞着海上浮冰。这里还漂着巨大的冰山。有些冰山的重量达到几百万吨。苏联‘光荣号’捕鲸船队有一次曾看到一整座浮冰岛，长二十二公里，宽六公里。有一次，在航行的一小时内他们曾遇到将近一千座冰山。显然，这样的情况，我们还在离岸几百公里处就会碰到的。”
    “请你谈一谈关于你们的航线和考察队船只的情形吧！”我请求说。
    航行两万公里
    “我们的主要船只柴油电动船‘鄂毕号’早在一年前就参加了科学考察工作”，索莫夫说，“在这期间，它曾到过十六个海，在最短期间内通过了北部的海路，并且在有冰地区显示出它的优点。
    “‘鄂毕号’的排水量为一万二千六百吨，在它的四个货舱里能容六千吨货物。为了补充现有的客舱，船上正在为考察队的参加者和科学实验室装配新的舱房。
    “船上装有无线电测位的设备，它能够在远距离内辨别出冰的情况。它装有供海洋学工作应用的最新的仪器和设备。它还设有深水绞车，能够从可能遇到的任何深度的水中取得水、土壤和海底动物的样品。
    “‘鄂毕号’在把考察队的陆地人员运送到南极洲岸边登陆以后，考察队的海上人员还要去从事海洋学的探测工作。这个工作将由我的科学副手，苏联科学院海洋学研究所所长、地理学博士科尔特领导。
    “和‘鄂毕号’一起出发的还有同样类型的柴油电动船‘勒拿号’，它在卸货以后，就要驶回祖国。为了给考察队运送不易保藏的食品，还有一艘冷藏船和我们同行或随后赶来。
    “我们距离目的地有二万多公里。我们要经过波罗的海和北海，进入大西洋，顺着零度子午线，以每小时十三英里的速率行驶，沿途不停舶，估计在出发以后要经过四十五个昼夜才能进入南极大陆沿岸的水面。
    “你问到考察队的组成情形。我们将有一百多人，包括考察队的海上人员在内。他们中间的许多人都是久经锻炼的极地工作者，曾经在严寒的北极‘学校’受过训练。和我们同行的还有‘北极—二号’、‘北极—三号’和‘北极—四号’漂流科学站的一些工作者。”
    “现在请你再谈谈考察队的装备情况。”我说。
    南极洲上的科学镇
    “在我们的船舱里，”索莫夫接着说，“我们将运去一整个村镇。它将由二十多所居住和工作房屋的建筑，以及发电站、停车场、修理所和仓库等特殊建筑物构成。
    “居住房屋是由带有可靠的保暖设备的预制板安装起来的。房屋的结构将使得房屋十分严密。电气水暖系统将保证温暖。每一所房屋的居住面积为四十六平方公尺，大约住八、九个人。
    “这些基本的房屋预定给主要基地的村镇。而对将在地磁极地区和所谓南极大陆不可到达的极地地区建立的另外两个基地，只能从空中把货物运送到那里去。我们带了二十所北极漂流站用的那种特别轻巧的沙波什尼科夫型的活动房屋。这种房屋面积为十二点五平方公尺，而总重量不过一吨，它的任何部件都轻到一个人就能拿得起。飞机或直升飞机可以自由地运送这种房屋，而装备这种房屋所用的时间不会超过二、三小时。”
    “考察队将有些什么运输工具呢？”我问。
    “首先是一个空运队。这就是它的队长契列维奇奈依同志”，索莫夫指着一个体格健壮、胸前佩带着苏联英雄金星奖章的人说，“我们的空运队里将有几架运输机和直升飞机。
    “考察队的陆上运输工具将包括强有力的拖拉机、新牌号的越野汽车和在北极使用得很成功的轮式汽车。我们还将有浮驶的工具——快艇和汽艇。最后，我们还有四副狗拉车具。”
    “探险队人员穿些什么？吃些什么呢？”我很感兴趣地问。
    “我们带有五百多吨重的食品、衣着和家务用的装备，”索莫夫接着说，“为了保证过冬的人们有便利的生活条件，一切都预先考虑到了。
    “苏联工业给考察队准备了用特别的防水织物做成的防风衣服。绵凫绒毛的暖衣可以保护人们抵挡南极的严寒。我们还有革制的和毛皮的衣服，用骆驼毛和绵凫绒毛做成的睡袋。过冬的人们将穿着毛皮的高筒靴和毛皮的长袜子，温暖的橡胶和皮革的靴鞋。
    “罐头工业给考察队准备了新品种的罐头。
    “冷藏船将给我们的基地运来新鲜的冻肉，饺子，鸟类和共重八十吨的白菜、马铃薯和其他新鲜蔬菜。为了保藏这些东西，将在基地上盖一个防寒的仓库。
    “我们还要为流动工作组运送各种精制食品，其中包括始终不变的精制食品‘彼米坎’，这种食品含有没有水分的肉、牛奶和鸡蛋。只要一小团三百公分重的这种食品，就能够维持一个人一昼夜的需要。”
    “你认为可能在当地找到食物吗？”
    “虽然南极的动物是很少的。但是那里也有鱼、企鹅和海豹，它们的肉是能吃的。我们将要猎捕它们。同时，也要携带渔具。”
    最后米哈伊尔·索莫夫说道：
    “科学考察是有趣的，引人入胜的。使人高兴的不仅是，我这样一个老的——我冒昧说一句——北极研究工作的参加者能有机会到地球的另一端。而且，这次考察的重要特点是各国科学家的密切的科学合作。在南极同我们在一起工作的将有英国和比利时、新西兰和挪威、智利和日本、阿根廷和法国的科学家。在离我们不远的西边将有澳大利亚人在那里工作，而在我们的东边，美国考察队将是我们的近邻，我相信，我们将成为好邻居。”
    在告别出来的时候，我向他们说：“亲爱的同志们，祝你们一路平安，胜利归来！”（附图片）
