The fifteen newly established agricultural cooperatives and two old cooperatives in Xiagu Township, Mengjin County, Henan Province, conscientiously studied the "Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and resolved many practical issues within the cooperatives.

The old No. 1 Cooperative in this township used to calculate land remuneration based on the output determined by land surveys, and the output was generally set too low. This time, after studying the draft model charter, they corrected this according to the principle of evaluating output by combining land quality and actual yield. The newly established No. 5 Cooperative also eliminated unreasonable phenomena of land evaluation being too high or too low after studying the draft model charter. When studying the draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives, the old No. 2 Cooperative in this township found that the cooperative's original charter lacked a clause on the rights of members, so they planned to supplement it according to the provisions of the draft model charter.

The method of Xiagu Township, Mengjin County, in learning the draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives in conjunction with reality not only enabled cooperative members to deeply understand the spirit of the draft model charter and improve their ideological awareness, but also promptly corrected deviations in the work of establishing cooperatives and resolved outstanding issues within the cooperatives.

    结合实际学习社章
    河南省孟津县下古乡十五个新建农业合作社和两个老社，认真学习“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”，解决了社内许多实际问题。
    这个乡的老社第一社的土地报酬，过去是按查田定产的产量计算的，产量一般定得偏低，这次学了示范章程草案，才按照把土地质量和实际产量结合起来评产的原则加以纠正。新建第五社学了示范章程草案，也消除了土地评产偏高偏低的不合理现象。这个乡的老社第二社在学习农业生产合作社示范章程草案的时候，发现社里原来制定的社章上缺少社员权利这一条，便打算根据示范章程草案的规定补充上去。
    孟津县下古乡这种结合实际学习农业生产合作社示范章程草案的方法，不仅使社员对示范章程草案的精神领会深刻，提高了社员的思想觉悟，还及时纠正了建社工作中的偏向，解决了社内的遗留问题。
