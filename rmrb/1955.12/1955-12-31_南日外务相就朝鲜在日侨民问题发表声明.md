Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 30th - According to the Korean Central News Agency: Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on December 29 regarding the issue of Korean citizens residing in Japan.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always been deeply concerned about Korean citizens residing in Japan. Representatives of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and delegations of Japanese Diet members and other Japanese delegations have reached agreements on a series of issues such as normalizing relations between the two countries and ensuring the legitimate rights and stable lives of Korean citizens in Japan. The people of Korea and Japan believe that the implementation of these agreements is in the common interest of the two peoples. However, the Japanese government has still not properly guaranteed the legitimate rights of Korean citizens, and as a result, their lives continue to be in an abnormal state.

The statement pointed out that the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in a statement issued on October 15 this year, expressed regret over the improper measures taken by the Japanese government against Korean citizens detained in the Omura detention center. However, the situation in this detention center has not improved until now. In addition, the Japanese government is still attempting to send detained Korean citizens to South Korea as hostages in "exchange" for Japanese fishermen detained in South Korea.

The statement concluded by saying that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses sympathy to the compatriots who are currently illegally detained in the Omura detention center, and once again demands that the Japanese government immediately release them and guarantee that they can return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea according to their own wishes.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, taking into account the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu on December 16 in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives expressing his readiness to allow Korean residents in Japan to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, now declares: In order to satisfactorily resolve various issues concerning Korean citizens in Japan, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is prepared to send representatives to Japan.

    南日外务相就朝鲜在日侨民问题发表声明
    新华社平壤三十日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日十二月二十九日就在日本的朝鲜公民问题发表声明。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府经常对居住在日本的朝鲜公民予以深切的关怀。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会的代表和日本国会议员代表团和其他日本代表团就两国关系正常化、保障在日本的朝鲜公民的合法权利和安定生活等一系列问题达成了协议。朝日两国人民相信，实现这些协议是符合两国人民的共同利益的。但是，日本政府仍然没有正当地保障朝鲜公民的合法权利，因而他们的生活继续处于不正常的状态。
    声明指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人在今年十月十五日发表的谈话中，曾对日本政府对被扣留在大村收容所的朝鲜公民所采取的不当措施表示遗憾。可是，这个收容所的情况直到现在还没有改善。另外，日本政府仍然继续企图把被扣留的朝鲜公民当作人质流放到南朝鲜去，以“交换”被扣留在南朝鲜的日本渔民。
    声明最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府向现在被非法扣留在大村收容所的同胞表示同情，并且再一次要求日本政府立即释放他们，保证他们按照自己的意愿返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府考虑到日本外务相重光葵十二月十六日在日本众议院外务委员会所表明的准备使旅日朝鲜公民归返朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的发言，现在声明：为了圆满地解决有关在日本的朝鲜公民的各种问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府准备派遣代表到日本去。
