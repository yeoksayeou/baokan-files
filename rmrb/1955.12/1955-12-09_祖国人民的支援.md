The central shaft of the Liaoyuan Coal Mine, a key project built with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union to lay the foundation for China's socialist industrialization, officially went into production on December 1st this year. Throughout the construction process of this pair of large-scale, highly mechanized new mines, it received the deep concern of the people of the whole country and the strong support of brother factories and mines in various places.

In the early stage of construction in November 1950, the workers were transferred from inclined shafts and lacked experience in tunneling. The Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau transferred a large number of experienced construction personnel. This not only ensured the completion of the initial construction tasks of the wellbore, but also trained new tunneling workers. In the complex electromechanical installation projects and a large number of plant construction projects, the employees of the Fushun Electromechanical Installation Company's Construction Site 102 and the Liaoyuan Work Area of the Fuxin Construction Engineering Office, who came to help with the construction, played a great role. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they completed the installation of the massive main and auxiliary headframes and the technically complex substations and boiler equipment with creative labor, ensuring quality and creating conditions for accelerating the overall project progress. The Signal Engineering Company of the Ministry of Railways and the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute also provided strong support in the design and construction of the vertical shaft.

Brother factories and mines in various places not only directly supported the construction of the vertical shaft, but also trained a large number of technicians and cadres for the production of the vertical shaft. In 1955 alone, more than a dozen brother factories and mines, including Fushun, Kailuan, Benxi, Beipiao and other mining bureaus, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Jixi Machinery General Factory, Fushun and Liaoyuan Power Plants, trained a large number of technicians such as drivers of combined coal miners, winches, and electric shovels. In particular, in order to meet the needs of the vertical shaft to implement V-shaped coal mining, the Fushun Mining Bureau also trained production personnel for us from section chiefs to workers, laying a favorable foundation for the smooth production of the central vertical shaft.

In addition to the complete set of high-quality new equipment supplied by the great Soviet Union, all parts of the country enthusiastically supported us with the equipment and materials needed by the central vertical shaft. In the past five years, the people of the whole country have supported the vertical shaft with nearly 100,000 tons of materials; including steel from Anshan Iron and Steel, Daye and Chongqing, Taiyuan, Dalian and other steel plants in the motherland's industrial base, cement from the first, second, fourth, seventh, and eighth cement plants, cables from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, and wood from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Heilongjiang Province and the mountainous areas of Jilin Province. From 1953 to 1955, more than 60 brother factories and mines distributed in more than a dozen provinces, thirty-plus cities, and counties supplied equipment to the vertical shaft.

Many moving deeds of brother factories and mines under the slogan of "Supporting Key Projects - Construction of the Central Vertical Shaft" deeply inspired us. Dalian Hardware Machinery General Factory and other factories completed the temporary order tasks of the vertical shaft on schedule with incomparable labor enthusiasm even after they had arranged the annual production tasks. In order to strive to complete the unplanned vertical shaft equipment processing tasks ahead of schedule and ensure the needs of the vertical shaft installation project, the employees of the Jilin Provincial Farm Tool Factory in Liaoyuan City often worked day and night to automatically work overtime. The Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory has processed more than 200 tons of non-standard equipment for the vertical shaft in the past two years. Not only was the delivery timely, but the quality of the processed products was excellent. Especially when processing the air filter of the vertical shaft air compressor in 1954, the workers and technicians improved the operation technology, which reduced the unit price from more than 8,000 yuan to more than 3,000 yuan. This item alone saved the country more than 20,000 yuan in vertical shaft investment. In the transportation of vertical shaft equipment and materials, the Ministry of Railways, the Jilin Railway Administration, and other bureaus and stations allocated sufficient unplanned train cars to ensure the timely supply of materials. When the vertical shaft was put into trial production in October this year, the Fushun and Jixi Mining Bureaus heard that we still lacked scraper conveyors, so they allocated eight scraper conveyors and ten explosion-proof motors to support us. These cordial concerns and strong support for the construction of the vertical shaft have deeply inspired us. In the future, we must, under the leadership of the Party, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, make persistent efforts, learn from the advanced production experience of Soviet coal mines with an open mind, strive to reach the design output standard of the vertical shaft, and exert the greatest strength to support the power resources needed for the industrial construction of the motherland!

After this modern mine in our country is put into production, our country will get more high-quality power coal from here every year to supply the needs of industrial construction and transportation.

    祖国人民的支援
    辽源矿务局代理局长　周海
    一九五○年十一月开工兴建的辽源煤矿中央竖井已经在今年十二月一日正式投入生产了。这一对规模巨大的、生产高度机械化的新型矿井，是苏联全面帮助我国为奠定社会主义工业化基础而建设的重点工程之一。在竖井的整个建设过程中，曾得到了全国人民的深切关怀和各地兄弟厂矿的有力支援。
    一九五○年建井初期，工人都是从斜井抽调来的，缺乏开凿井筒经验，唐山开滦矿务局便调来了大批富有经验的施工人员。这不仅保证了井筒初期建设任务的完成，还培养了新的打井工人。在复杂的机电安装工程和大量的厂房建筑工程施工中，前来帮助施工的抚顺机电安装公司一○二工地和阜新建筑工程处辽源工区的职工们都发挥了很大作用。他们在苏联专家指导下，以创造性的劳动，在保证质量的前提下，顺利地完成了庞大的主、副井架安装工程和技术复杂的变电所、锅炉设备等安装工程。他们还克服了冬季气候寒冷的困难，完成了大量结构复杂的厂房建筑和混凝土浇灌工程，为加速整个工程进度创造了条件。铁道部信号工程公司、沈阳煤矿设计院也都在竖井设计、施工等方面直接给予了有力支援。
    各地兄弟厂矿不仅直接支援了竖井建设，而且为竖井生产培训了大量技术工人和干部。仅一九五五年内就有抚顺、开滦、本溪、北票等矿务局、沈阳第一机械厂、鸡西机械总厂、抚顺、辽源发电站等十余个兄弟厂矿为我们培养了联合采煤机、绞车、电铲等司机以及其他各工种的大批技术工人。特别是抚顺矿务局为适应竖井实行V型采煤法需要，还给我们培养了从段长到工人全段的生产人员，为中央竖井的顺利生产打下了有利的基础。
    中央竖井所需要的设备和器材，除了伟大的苏联给我们供应全套品质精良的新式设备外，全国各地也热情地支援我们。五年来，全国人民支援竖井需用的物资近十多万吨；其中有来自祖国工业基地鞍钢、大冶和重庆、太原、大连等地钢铁厂的钢材，有来自第一、二、四、七、八水泥厂的水泥，有来自上海、天津等地的电缆，有来自内蒙古自治区、黑龙江省和吉林省山区的木材。从一九五三年到一九五五年为竖井供应设备的就有分布在十多个省份、三十多市、县的六十多个兄弟厂矿。
    各个兄弟厂矿在“支援重点工程——中央竖井建设”口号下的许多动人事迹深深地鼓舞了我们。大连五金机械总厂等都在已经安排好全年生产任务的情况下，又以无比的劳动热情按期完成了竖井的临时订货任务。辽源市吉林省农具厂为争取提前完成计划外的竖井设备加工任务，保证竖井安装工程需要，职工们经常昼夜不息地自动加班突击。吉林省机械厂两年来为竖井加工非标准设备共达二百多吨，不仅交货及时，而且加工出来的产品质量都是优等的，特别是在一九五四年加工竖井空气压缩机空气过滤器的时候，由于工人和技术人员改进了操作技术，使单价由八千多元降低到三千多元，只此一项就为国家节省竖井投资两万多元。在竖井器材设备运输上，铁道部、吉林铁路管理局及其它局、站曾调给足够的计划外车皮，保证了器材的按时供应。今年十月竖井试生产的时候，抚顺、鸡西矿务局听说我们还缺少刮板运输机，便分别调给八台刮板运输机和十台耐爆电动机支援我们。这些对竖井建设的亲切关心和有力支援，都深深地鼓舞着我们。今后我们一定要在党的领导下，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，虚心学习苏联煤矿的先进生产经验，努力达到竖井设计产量标准，为支援祖国工业建设所需要的动力资源而发挥最大的力量！（附图片）
    这座我国现代化的矿井投入生产后，我们国家每年将从这里得到更多的质量优良的动力用煤，来供应工业建设和交通运输的需要。
