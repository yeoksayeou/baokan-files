The pumping irrigation project, invested in by the state, has been completed in Anning District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, a major fruit and melon producing area. The farmers here have begun to use water from the Yellow River to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of arid sandy land.

The fruit trees in Anning District account for half of all the fruit trees in Lanzhou City. According to the urban plan of Lanzhou City, Anning District is to become a scenic garden area that supplies large quantities of melons, fruits, and vegetables. However, because many lands are far from the Yellow River and cannot be irrigated, they cannot be used rationally, and many fruit trees have withered and died. The completion of the pumping irrigation project has powerfully helped farmers solve this difficulty. It is estimated that the yield of the irrigated land will increase by about five times compared to the original dry land.

    兰州安宁区抽水灌溉工程完工
    在甘肃省兰州市的主要瓜果产地——安宁区，由国家投资建设的抽水机灌溉工程已经完工。这里的农民开始利用黄河水浇灌一万多亩黄沙旱地。
    安宁区的果树，占兰州市所有果树的一半。按照兰州市的城市规划，安宁区要成为一个风景秀丽、大量供应瓜果、蔬菜的园林区。但是因为很多土地距离黄河较远、浇不上水而不能合理的利用，而且不少果树枯干致死。抽水机灌溉工程的建成，有力的帮助农民解决了这一困难，预计水地的产量较原来的旱地可增加五倍左右的收成。
