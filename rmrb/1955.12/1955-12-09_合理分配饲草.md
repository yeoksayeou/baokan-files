　　Rationally Allocate Fodder
　　Jian Guo Agricultural Production Cooperative of Gang Gou Township, Li Cheng County, Shandong Province, paid attention to solving the problem of fodder allocation during this year's autumn harvest distribution.
　　In the past, the cadres of this cooperative did not take into account the needs of households with livestock when distributing fodder, nor did they pay attention to storing fodder. During the spring plowing season this year, the fifteen heads of draught animals raised collectively and privately for public use in the cooperative were short of more than 2,200 jin of fodder. Because they lacked fodder, the members also sold three heads of draught animals. The whole cooperative had twenty mu of land that was cultivated later due to insufficient animal power, and it is estimated that 1,600 jin of grain were lost.
　　This year, the cooperative's cadres rationally allocated fodder, so that members with livestock received more fodder. Wang Qingyao, a member, has a donkey. According to the land dividend ratio, he could only get 1,500 jin of fodder. Now, he received less firewood and more fodder by 1,500 jin. The cooperative cadres also carefully calculated the accounts: In the next eight months, the fifteen heads of draught animals in the whole cooperative will be short of more than 2,100 jin of fodder. They plan to mobilize members to cut 4,000 jin of mountain grass. In addition, they also studied ways to save grass. With the fodder problem solved, the members' enthusiasm for raising and breeding livestock has also increased, and two households are preparing to buy two heads of livestock.

    合理分配饲草
    山东省历城县港沟乡建国农业生产合作社在今年秋收分配的时候，注意解决了饲草的分配问题。
    过去这个合作社的干部在分配饲草时没有照顾到有牲畜的户的需要，也不注意贮备饲草。今年春耕时期，社内公养的和私有公用的十五头耕畜就缺少两千二百多斤饲草。社员因为没有饲草，还卖掉了三头耕畜。全社有二十亩地因为畜力不足，耕种得较晚，估计少收了一千六百斤粮食。
    今年合作社的干部对饲草作了合理分配，使有牲畜的社员多分得一些饲草。社员王庆尧有一头驴，按土地分红比例，他只能分到饲草一千五百斤；现在，他少分了一部分柴草，又多分了一千五百斤饲草。社干部们还认真算了一笔账：在今后八个月当中，全社十五头耕畜缺少两千一百多斤饲草。他们计划发动社员割山草四千斤。另外，他们还研究了节约用草的办法。饲草问题解决了，社员们饲养和繁殖牲畜的积极性也提高了，有两户社员正在准备买两头牲畜。
