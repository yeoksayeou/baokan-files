The Sixth Construction Section of the No. 6 Engineering Office of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau accepted a task—contracting for the machinery warehouse of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau's Machinery Supply Station. After accepting this task, the responsible personnel of the construction section felt that since they had done large projects with a cost of several million yuan, what was this small project of only nine thousand yuan? They thought they could "build it with their eyes closed." Therefore, they only sent a technical staff member who had just graduated from school and had no construction experience to lead the construction. During the construction, they also wanted to find "shortcuts" to save money on this small project, and did not construct according to the drawings. The fish-tail screws, the most important part in the design that connects the wall and the roof truss, were "saved"; the concrete filling board under the roof truss was changed to wood. The brick walls were also poorly built with uneven brick pillars and thin mortar.

As a result, less than a week after completion, on a night with a force six gale, the roof truss disappeared and the entire wall collapsed. In the morning, the complacent leaders of the construction section woke up from their dreams and were unexpectedly shocked. According to the appraisal, repairing this warehouse will not only cost more than 6,000 yuan in repair costs, but also extend the construction period by more than two months, with the rework cost accounting for more than 70% of the original cost. This is the "unprecedented new record" created by this construction section with "rich experience" that had worked on "large projects of several million yuan" on this small project!

    小工程出了大事故
    中南工程管理总局第六工程处六○九工段接受了一项任务——承包中南工程管理总局机械供应站的机具仓库。工段的负责人员接受了这个任务之后，觉得几百万元造价的大工程都做过了，何况这个只有九千多元的小工程，以为“闭着眼睛也盖起来了”。于是，他们只派了一个刚从学校毕业，没有一点施工经验的技术人员去领导施工。在施工中，他们又想从这个小工程上找节约的“窍门”，不按图纸施工。设计中最重要的使墙身和屋架相接连的鱼尾螺丝，被“节约”掉了；屋架下面的混凝土填板，改用了木制的。砌的墙也是砖柱不正，灰浆稀薄。
    结果完工不到一个星期，在刮六级大风的一个夜晚，屋架不翼而飞了，墙身全部倒塌。清晨，沾沾自喜的工段领导人员从睡梦中醒来，出乎意外地大吃了一惊。鉴定的结果，修复这座仓库不仅要用六千余元的修补费，而且工期要延长两个月以上，返工费占原造价百分之七十以上。这就是这个干过“几百万元的大工程”的有“丰富经验”的工段，在这个小工程上创造的“空前新纪录”！
