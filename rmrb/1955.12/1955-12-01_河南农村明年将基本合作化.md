    Henan Rural Areas to Basically Cooperativize Next Year

    From November 5th to 21st, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged cadre meeting, mainly to discuss the consolidation of new cooperatives and the improvement of old ones.

    In the past two months, Henan Province has developed from the original 44,625 agricultural producers' cooperatives to 135,413 cooperatives, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has increased from 13% of the total number of households to 46%. The Provincial Party Committee has determined in its plan that 173,000 cooperatives will be developed this winter, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach 56.6% of the total number of households. Before the spring plowing next year, this batch of cooperatives will be consolidated and rectified in a planned manner, and preparations will continue to be made for expanding and building cooperatives. During this period, 300 advanced cooperatives will also be established on a trial basis. By August 1956, the number of agricultural cooperatives will have increased to 320,593, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach more than 75% of the total number of households, basically realizing semi-socialist cooperativization. In the second half of the year, another 700 advanced cooperatives will be established on a trial basis, so that every county will have a trial run.

    At the meeting, Comrade Yang Weiping, First Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a summary on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, put forward the target of increasing grain production, and requested that grain production reach 28 billion catties next year and 32 billion catties in 1957, an increase of 6.7 billion catties compared with the present; and also required that the yield per mu be 500 catties, and the average per capita grain be 1,200 catties.

    河南农村明年将基本合作化
    中共河南省委员会在十一月五日到二十一日，召开了扩大干部会议，主要讨论了巩固新社和提高老社的问题。
    两个月来，河南全省已在原有四万四千六百二十五个农业生产合作社的基础上，发展到十三万五千四百十三个社，入社农户已由占总农户的百分之十三增加到百分之四十六。省委在规划中确定今冬要发展到十七万三千个社，入社农户达到占总农户的百分之五十六点六。明年春耕前有计划地把这批社巩固整顿好，并继续做好扩社建社的准备。在这期间，还要试办三百个高级合作社。到一九五六年八月农业合作社要发展到三十二万零五百九十三个，入社农户达到占总农户的百分之七十五以上，基本上实现半社会主义合作化。下半年再试办七百个高级社，达到县县试办。
    在会议上，省委第一副书记杨蔚屏同志代表省委作了总结，提出了增产粮食的指标，要求明年产粮二百八十亿斤，一九五七年产粮三百二十亿斤，比现在增产六十七亿斤；并且要求每亩地产量为五百斤，每人平均为一千二百斤粮食。
