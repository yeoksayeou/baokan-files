    Eliminate Oil Leakage Accidents During Transportation
    To the Editor:
    Some railway departments frequently experience commercial accidents during loading and unloading, causing undue losses to state materials. For example, on August 12th of this year, the Beijing Oils and Fats Company received seventy-three barrels of cottonseed oil from Huangtai Station in Shandong at Yongdingmen Station. Because many oil drums were damaged during loading and unloading, they leaked severely; one barrel only had thirty catties left, and another only had sixty catties left (originally, each barrel should have had three hundred catties of oil). Similar phenomena have occurred more than once. For example, in March of this year, the Beijing Oils and Fats Company received one hundred and forty barrels of tung oil shipped from Changsha. Six barrels were broken while being unloaded at Yongdingmen Station, resulting in a loss of sixty-seven catties of oil.
    Regarding this oil leakage phenomenon, some railway transport departments always emphasize objective reasons and do not actively improve loading and unloading techniques or strengthen the education of loading and unloading workers. Sometimes, when oil leakage occurs during transportation, the personnel involved do not immediately try to remedy the situation, but instead watch as large quantities of oil are wasted. How heartbreaking this phenomenon is!

### 杜绝运输途中的漏油事故

    杜绝运输途中的漏油事故编辑同志：
    有些铁路部门在装卸货物的时候，经常发生商务事故，使国家的物资遭受不应有的损失。例如，今年八月十二日，北京市油脂公司在永定门车站领到山东黄台车站发来的七十三桶棉子油。这批油因为很多油桶在装卸过程中被碰破了，漏得很厉害；其中有一桶油只剩了三十斤，另一桶只剩了六十斤
  （原来每桶应该有油三百斤）。类似现象还不止这一次。像今年三月间，北京市油脂公司收到从长沙运来一百四十桶桐油，在永定门车站卸车的时候就被摔破了六桶，损失了六十七斤油。
    对于这种漏油现象，有的铁路运输部门总是强调客观原因，而不积极改进装卸技术和加强对装卸工人的教育。甚至有时在运输途中发生了漏油现象，有关人员也不立即设法挽救，眼看着大批油品浪费掉。这种现象多么令人痛心！
