Regarding the Saarland Parliamentary Election

    Saarland held new parliamentary elections on December 18th. Despite facing numerous obstacles in the election campaign, the Saarland Communist Party still received more than 38,000 votes and gained two seats in the new parliament, strengthening its position.

    Among the bourgeois parties, the Christian People's Party, which supported the "Saar Statute," won only thirteen seats (previously twenty-nine) in the new parliament of fifty seats, and the Saar Social Democratic Party won two seats. The so-called "pro-German" parties, the Christian Democratic Union, the Saar Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party, which have recently resumed activities, won fourteen, twelve, and seven seats respectively. Together, these three parties hold a majority in the new parliament. This is a new development in the struggle between West German and French monopoly capital for control of the Saar. Most French diplomatic commentators believe that the election result is a new blow to France's economic and political position in the Saar.

    Before the Saarland parliamentary elections, the ruling groups in West Germany and France had tried their best to influence the election results in their favor, in order to gain an advantageous position in the negotiations on the future of the Saar in January 1956. The dispute between the two sides was very fierce. On December 7, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the West German Federal Parliament decided that the Saar should become part of West Germany as soon as possible. The French Foreign Ministry immediately issued a statement saying, "The Saar parliament has no right to decide on the territorial status of the Saar. Any decision made without the consent of France is invalid." On the eve of the vote, West German Chancellor Adenauer called on the people of the Saar to support the "pro-German" parties. The French Foreign Ministry reiterated that a new solution to the Saar issue could only be negotiated after the formation of a new French government in January next year, and that the negotiations must take into account France's economic interests in the Saar.

    What is going on? It is like this:

    The Saar Constitution, adopted in 1947, stipulates that "the Saar is an autonomous... territory, economically attached to France." In recent years, the Saar has been in such a state of "autonomy," with pro-French parties controlling the parliament and government, and the Saar being economically controlled by France. In competition with West German monopoly capital, French monopoly capital's control of the Saar economy is an important advantage for it. Materials published by France show that in the coal and steel production of the six Western European countries in the Coal and Steel Community, West Germany accounts for 45 percent, France and the Saar together account for 32 percent, of which the Saar accounts for 8 percent. The Saar provides France with large amounts of coal and steel without France spending foreign exchange; at the same time, the Saar has been the second largest buyer of French agricultural products for several years. This shows that if the French ruling group loses control of the Saar, its position will be greatly weakened.

    Of course, West German, mainly Ruhr, monopoly capital has also been working hard in recent years to regain control of the Saar metallurgical enterprises and invest heavily in other areas. Therefore, the dispute caused by the Saar has become one of the reasons for the increasing sharpness of the contradictions between France and West Germany.

    On October 23, 1954, at the same time as the signing of the Paris Agreement on the militarization of West Germany, the Saar Statute was also signed, which was to "Europeanize" the Saar region. According to this "Statute," the internal affairs and defense of the Saar were to be the responsibility of a European "Commissioner" appointed by and responsible to the Council of the Western European Union, allowing the activities of the previously prohibited so-called "pro-German" parties, and gradually extending the priority given to France in economic matters to West Germany. If a referendum agreed to this Statute, it would remain in effect until the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Thus, the "Saar Statute" was the exchange condition for the French ruling group's consent to the remilitarization of West Germany. This kind of political collusion, which disregarded the national interests of the people of the Saar, could not but be opposed by the people of the Saar, who rejected the "Saar Statute" in a referendum on October 23 this year. The Hoffmann government, which supported the "Statute," had to resign and decided to hold new parliamentary elections.

    After the rejection of the "Saar Statute" and the election of a new parliament, the struggle for the Saar will not stop, but will become more intense. A Reuters report acknowledged that the parliamentary election "raised more new questions than it solved old ones."

    The Saar Communist Party, which has always defended the interests of the Saar and German people, issued a statement after the election stating that the election had brought a political victory to the working people. It called on all workers, especially German Social Democrats and Saar Social Democrats, to unite their forces with the forces of the Communist Party in order to prevent the Saar from being sold to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union through united action, and to effectively defend the right of the German Saar people to strive for peaceful and democratic reunification with the whole of Germany. This points out a clear direction for the future struggle of the people of the Saar.

### 关于萨尔议会选举

    关于萨尔议会选举
    萨尔在十二月十八日举行了新的议会选举。投票结果萨尔共产党在竞选运动中虽然遭到重重阻挠，仍然得到三万八千多张选票，在新议会中得到两席，它的地位得到了加强。
    在资产阶级政党中间，支持“萨尔法规”的基督教人民党在新议会五十个议席中只得到十三席（原有二十九席），萨尔社会民主党两席；而近来才恢复活动的所谓“亲德”党派，基督教民主联盟、萨尔民主党和社会民主党，分别获得十四席、十二席和七席，这三个党合起来占了新议会的多数。这是西德和法国垄断资本争夺萨尔的斗争中的一个新的发展。法国的大多数外交评论员认为，这次选举结果对于法国在萨尔的经济和政治地位是一个新打击。
    在萨尔议会选举以前，西德和法国的统治集团都曾极力活动使选举结果对自己有利，以便在一九五六年一月间谈判萨尔的前途时占据优势的地位，双方争执很激烈。十二月七日，西德联邦议院外交委员会作出决定说，萨尔应当尽速成为西德的一部分。法国外交部立即发表声明说，“萨尔议会无权决定萨尔的领土地位。没有得到法国同意的任何决定都是无效的”。西德总理阿登纳在投票前夕要萨尔人民支持“亲德”的党派。法国外交部再次表示：新的萨尔解决办法，只有在明年一月法国组成新政府后才能进行谈判，谈判必须考虑法国在萨尔的经济利益。
    这是怎么一回事呢？是这样的：
    一九四七年通过的萨尔宪法规定：“萨尔是自治的……领地，在经济上附属于法国”。近年来，萨尔就是处于这样一种“自治”状态，亲法政党控制了议会和政府，萨尔在经济上也受法国控制。法国垄断资本在同西德垄断资本的竞争中，控制萨尔经济是它的一个重要的有利因素。法国公布的材料表明：在西欧六国煤钢联营的煤和钢产量中，西德占百分之四十五，法国和萨尔共占百分之三十二，其中萨尔占百分之八。萨尔向法国提供了大量的煤钢，不用法国支出外汇；同时，几年来萨尔一直是法国农产品的第二位买主。这就表明，法国统治集团如果失掉对萨尔的控制，那末它们的地位将大大削弱。
    当然，西德的，主要是鲁尔的垄断资本近几年来一直也没有放松过重新控制萨尔冶金企业和在其他方面大量投资的努力。所以，由萨尔引起的争执就成了法国和西德之间的矛盾日益尖锐的原因之一。
    一九五四年十月二十三日在签订关于西德军国主义化的巴黎协定的同时，也签订了关于萨尔的协定，这就是要把萨尔地区“欧洲化”的所谓“萨尔法规”。根据这个“法规”，萨尔的内政和国防问题交给由西欧联盟理事会任命并对它负责的欧洲人“长官”负责，允许从前被禁止的所谓“亲德”党派活动，并把给予法国在经济方面的优先权逐步扩大到西德。如果公民投票同意这个法规，它就一直有效，直到对德和约缔结为止。由此可见，“萨尔法规”就是使法国统治集团同意西德重新军国主义化的交换条件。这种不顾萨尔人民的民族利益而进行的政治勾结不能不遭到萨尔人民的反对，他们在今年十月二十三日的公民投票中拒绝了“萨尔法规”。支持“法规”的霍夫曼政府不得不辞职下台，并决定了举行新的议会选举。
    在“萨尔法规”被否决和新的议会选出后，争夺萨尔的斗争并不会就此停止，而是会更趋激烈。路透社的报道承认，这次议会选举“引起的新问题比它解决的老问题更多”。
    一贯维护萨尔和德国人民的利益的萨尔共产党，在选举后发表声明说，这次选举已经使劳动人民取得了一个政治胜利。它号召所有工人，特别是德国社会民主党人和萨尔社会民主党人，把他们的力量同共产党的力量联合起来，以便通过团结行动来阻止把萨尔出卖给北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟，以便有效地保卫德国萨尔人民争取同整个德国和平、民主地重新统一的权利。这为萨尔人民今后的斗争指出了明确的方向。        （田）
