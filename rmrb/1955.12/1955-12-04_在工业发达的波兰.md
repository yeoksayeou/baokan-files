    In Industrially Developed Poland
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    In the tree-lined parks and spacious pedestrian walkways of Warsaw, many beautifully dressed women push pristine white baby carriages, cradling innocent and lively infants. The same scene captivated me in other Polish cities. Poland's population was 24 million in 1948, and it grew to 27 million in 1954, an increase of approximately 500,000 per year. Before World War II, the proportion of children in Poland's population was declining, and the entire population suffered enormous losses during the war. Therefore, the rapid population growth in Poland after liberation and the rise in the proportion of children are particularly gratifying sights.
    If the significant increase in Poland's population is like thousands upon thousands of newly born trees patching up the cleared spaces in a felled forest, then the widespread construction of houses in Poland is like thousands upon thousands of fresh flowers covering a trampled garden. Twenty-nine residential areas are under construction simultaneously in Warsaw. New houses are visibly increasing day by day. The remaining broken walls and ruins from the war are decreasing day by day. Entire streets have been completely rebuilt from the ruins. Among the newly built structures, many are industrial enterprises. To realize the Six-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the Polish people are sparing no effort in carrying out the basic construction of heavy industry, which serves as the foundation of the national economy.
    Near Krakow, in Nowa Huta, I saw the Lenin Steel Plant under construction, which is the pride of People's Poland. This steel complex, which is not only the largest in Poland but also in Europe (excluding the Soviet Union), began construction in 1950 and now has two blast furnaces, four open-hearth furnaces, three coke ovens, and a primary rolling mill in operation and recently produced 500,000 tons of pig iron. In addition, new open-hearth furnaces and workshops for sheet metal, tinplate, etc., will be built. All equipment is automated. Chief Engineer Horbachevsky said: "The establishment of this steel complex will open up broad prospects for the development of other industries. The second phase of construction will continue during the next Five-Year Plan period. The design has already prepared for future development." When the entire project is completed, this enterprise will produce 1.5 million tons of steel annually, exceeding the total steel production of all twenty-three steel mills in pre-war Poland.
    A brand-new workers' residential area is emerging next to the enterprise. Forty thousand rooms and 370,000 square meters of public space have already been built. A new city is taking shape. It will house 100,000 residents. The steel plant will have its own docks connected to the Vistula River.
    The Lenin Steel Plant left me with the impression that it will not only be the most magnificent pillar of Poland's economy but also a factor in greatly strengthening the leadership influence of the Polish working class in Krakow and southern Poland. When I was in Krakow, I asked Polish comrades: Besides the convenience of using Silesian coal to smelt iron ore imported from Ukraine and besides the convenience of utilizing the water from the Vistula River, what other considerations were there in choosing Nowa Huta as the factory site? A responsible comrade from the newspaper told me: Krakow is an ancient city with a long culture, and the new force of workers that emerged with the establishment of the new steel enterprise will have an important political influence in this area.
    Poland's annual steel production before the war fluctuated between 500,000 and 1.5 million tons, while the steel production in 1955 will be 4.5 million tons. This is approximately twice the 1949 output (2.3 million tons) before the start of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955). This is not only due to the construction of new plants but also due to the renovation and expansion of old ones, and the improvement of labor productivity. New mechanized and automated blast furnaces with volumes of 750 to 850 cubic meters, one to two times larger than the old blast furnaces, have been added to the Bierut, Kosciuszko, and other steel plants. New primary rolling mills, steel pipe machines, and sheet metal machines have been added to the Bobrek, Pokoj, and other steel plants. The Bierut Steel Plant in Czestochowa has built six modern open-hearth furnaces, which can produce more than one million tons of steel annually. Poland is currently preparing a new Five-Year Plan, and it is expected that Poland's steel production will reach 6.5 million or 7 million tons by 1960. If we calculate based on Poland's population increasing to 30 million at that time, the average person will have 233 kilograms of steel, which is a very high level.
    The exploration and mining of iron ore for steelmaking did not receive much attention in pre-war Poland. After liberation, Poland has been intensifying its efforts in this area. Six new iron mines with high productivity are currently being built in the old mining areas of the Stalinogrod and Kletsk regions. In 1954, rich iron ore deposits were discovered in the Rzedcza area of the Lodz Province. The mineral resources of this iron ore deposit are much thicker and more valuable than any other known iron ore deposit in Poland. It will be developed during the new Five-Year Plan period.
    Poland is committed to developing its steel industry, but coal, not steel, occupies the leading position in Poland's industry. Poland's coal production ranks fifth in the world. I went to Stalinogrod in Silesia, which is the center of the coal mining area. This place is reminiscent of the Donbas in the Soviet Union. One coal mine follows another. Along with the coal mines, many steel plants and coking plants have appeared. Cities have formed from these mines and plants. I drove in a car and could not finish traversing these cities, which are connected to each other like a string of pearls, in two or three hours, and could not see enough of the factories with rows of chimneys in this area. In Stalinogrod, I went down to the Kleofas mine. This old mine, which has been operating for seventy years, was the first in Poland to use a combined coal mining machine. It supplies other coal mines with skilled workers. The coal it produces is exported abroad. During the Six-Year Plan period, Poland built seven new mines, each said to have a coal production capacity of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 tons per day and night. Poland pays close attention to improving coal mining technology. A new mine using hydraulic mining has been built. According to coal mine engineers: there, hydraulic machines spray strong water jets to wash down the coal seams, and then pumps use pipelines to pump the coal mixed with water to the destination. Hydraulic mining is much cheaper than mechanized mining. Poland's annual coal production before the war was 38 million tons, and in 1955 it will increase to 93.5 million tons. Poland exports coal to twenty-four countries in exchange for materials needed domestically. Coal is Poland's "national treasure".
    At the Poznan International Fair, the Polish pavilions collectively displayed the vigorous development of its machine manufacturing industry. Ships, automobiles, tractors, agricultural machinery, locomotives, heavy-duty lathes, mining equipment, as well as metallurgical, electrical, chemical, textile, and other machines can all be manufactured domestically. At the Szczecin port at the mouth of the Oder River, I saw a shipyard manufacturing many 3,000-ton cargo ships. Larger ships are being manufactured at the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia. After liberation, Poland has more than 500 kilometers of coastline on the Baltic Sea. The tonnage of merchant ships it manufactured in 1955 will increase twofold compared to 1949, and even more compared to before the war. Its merchant ships sail to many countries in Asia, South America, the Mediterranean, and Europe.
    In Poland, I also saw many factories, such as the heavy-duty lathe and locomotive factory near Poznan, the agricultural machinery factory, and the tractor factory and automobile factory near Warsaw. These factories were all newly built or renovated after the war. The foundation of Poland's machine manufacturing industry was very weak before liberation, and it has only been greatly developed in the years since the establishment of the people's government. Calculated per capita, it now produces nine times more machines than before the war, of which metalworking lathes are fifteen times more.
    Poland currently has 700 cities. Due to the correct implementation of the principle of rational distribution of productive forces, the unbalanced state of domestic industrial development has been changed. Eighty percent of the newly emerging industrial enterprises have appeared in areas that were originally industrially underdeveloped. Approximately forty enterprises, including a steel plant, have been established around Warsaw.
    Soviet unselfish assistance can be seen everywhere in Poland's various industrial areas, which is an important condition for the smooth progress of Polish industry. The complete set of equipment for the Warsaw Automobile Factory was designed by the Soviet Gorky Automobile Factory, and the automobiles produced are identical to the Soviet "Victory" cars. The Lenin Steel Plant was also designed with Soviet assistance, and the basic machinery of the entire enterprise was also supplied by the Soviet Union.
    Prioritizing the development of heavy industry has enabled People's Poland to grow into a first-class industrial country in Europe in a short period. Now, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people are continuing to prioritize the development of heavy industry, paying attention to vigorously developing agricultural collectivization and increasing agricultural production, in order to ensure that agriculture can adapt to the rapidly developing industry and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, which serves as the foundation of the people's regime.
    This year is the final year of Poland's Six-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Workers in all sectors of Poland are working hard to complete the Six-Year Plan. Undoubtedly, Poland will further develop its industry and agriculture in completing the Six-Year Plan, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

### 在工业发达的波兰

    在工业发达的波兰 
    本报记者  李何
    在华沙绿树成荫的公园和宽敞的行人道上，许多服饰秀丽的妇女推着洁白的手车，车子里放着天真活泼的婴儿，在波兰的其他城市，同样的景象吸引着我。波兰在一九四八年有二千四百万人口，在一九五四年增长到二千七百万，每年增加约五十万。波兰在第二次世界大战以前，儿童在人口中的比重是下降的，整个人口在战时受到了巨大的损失。所以波兰解放后人口的迅速增长，儿童在人口中比重的上升，是特别可喜的景象。
    如果说波兰人口的大大增长，好比成千成万棵新生的树木补缀着被砍伐过的林间空地；那末，波兰房屋的普遍建筑，就像成千成万朵鲜花重盖着被践踏过的园圃。在华沙市内同时有二十九个住宅区在建筑。新的房屋眼看着一天天增多起来。战时留下的断墙残壁一天天减少了。有的整条街从废墟上完全重建起来。在新盖的建筑物当中，许多是工业企业。波兰人民为了实现发展国民经济的六年计划，不遗余力地进行着作为国民经济基础的重工业的基本建设。
    在克拉科夫附近诺瓦·胡塔，我看到了在建设中的列宁冶金联合企业，它是人民波兰的骄傲。这个不单在波兰而且在欧洲（不包括苏联）都算是最大的钢铁联合企业，在一九五○年开始建设，现在已经有两座高炉、四座平炉、三座炼焦炉、一座初轧机投入生产并且在不久前炼出了五十万吨生铁。此外，还要建设新的平炉和薄板、马口铁等车间。所有设备都是自动化的。主任工程师何尔巴契夫斯基说：“这个钢铁联合企业的建立，将为其他工业的发展开辟广阔的前途。第二阶段的建设将在下一个五年计划时期继续。设计时已经为将来的发展作了准备。”当全部工程完工以后，这个企业每年将产一百五十万吨钢，超过战前波兰所有二十三个钢铁厂产钢量的总和。
    在企业旁边兴起崭新的工人住宅区。已经盖好四万间房间和三十七万平方公尺公用场所。一座新的城市具备了雏型。这里将住十万居民。钢铁厂将有自己的码头通到维斯杜拉河。
    列宁冶金联合企业留给我这样的印象：它将不只是波兰经济上最雄壮的支柱，也将是大大加强波兰工人阶级在克拉科夫和波兰南部的领导影响的因素。在克拉科夫的时候，我曾经询问波兰同志：选择诺瓦·胡塔为厂址，除了便于用西里西亚的煤来炼从乌克兰输入的铁矿石以外，除了便于利用维斯杜拉河的水以外，还有什么着眼点呢？一位报纸的负责同志告诉我：克拉科夫是一个文化悠久的古城，随着新钢铁企业的建立而出现的工人生力军，将给这一带重要的政治影响。
    波兰在战前每年产钢量摇摆在五十万到一百五十万吨之间，而一九五五年产钢量将为四百五十万吨。约相当于六年计划（一九五零—一九五五年）开始前一九四九年产量（二百三十万吨）的两倍。这不但由于建设新的，也由于改建扩建旧的，和提高劳动生产率。在贝鲁特、科斯久什科和其他钢铁厂添建了机械化自动化的新高炉，容积七百五十到八百五十立方公尺，比旧高炉大一、二倍。在伯布莱克、波库伊等等钢铁厂增加了新的初轧机、钢管机、薄板机。在捷斯托科发的贝鲁特钢铁工厂已建立了六座现代化平炉，它每年可生产一百多万吨钢。波兰正在编制新的五年计划，预期到一九六○年波兰的产钢量将达到六百五十万或七百万吨。如果以那时波兰人口增加到三千万计算，平均每人将有二百三十三公斤钢，这个水平是很高的。
    炼钢铁用的铁矿的勘探和开采，战前在波兰是不受注意的。解放后的波兰日益加紧这方面的工作。现在在斯大林诺格罗德州和克列茨克州的旧矿区建设着六座生产率很高的新铁矿。一九五四年在罗兹省列日查地区发现了丰富的铁矿，这个铁矿的矿藏比波兰国内其他已经知道的最大的铁矿要厚得多而且更有价值。它将在新的五年计划时期开发。
    波兰在致力发展钢铁工业，但是在波兰工业中占居首位的是煤而不是钢铁。波兰的煤产量占居世界第五位。我到了西里西亚的斯大林诺格罗德，那是煤矿区中心。这里令人想起苏联的顿巴斯。煤矿一个接着一个。随同煤矿出现了许多钢铁厂、炼焦厂。由这些矿厂形成了城市。我乘着汽车，两三小时走不完这些像一串珍珠相互衔接的城市，看不尽这一带烟囱林立的工厂。在斯大林诺格罗德，我下到克里奥弗斯矿。这个开采已经七十年的老矿，在波兰第一个采用联合采煤机。它供给其他煤矿以熟练的工人。它产的煤出口到国外去。在六年计划时期，波兰建立了七座新矿，据说每座一昼夜产煤能力约五、六千吨到万吨。波兰对于改进采煤技术很注意。一座用水力采煤的新矿已经建成。据煤矿工程师谈：那里用水力机喷射强力的水流冲下煤层，再用抽水机把这些带水的煤经过输送管抽送到目的地。水力采煤法比机械化采煤法成本低得多。波兰在战前每年产煤三千八百万吨，在一九五五年将提高到产煤九千三百五十万吨。波兰的煤出口到二十四个国家，换回国内所需要物资。煤，是波兰的“国宝”。
    在波兹南的国际博览会上，波兰各展览馆集中显示了它的机器制造业的蓬勃发展。轮船、汽车、拖拉机、农机、机车、重型车床、矿山设备，以及冶金、电力、化学、纺织等等机器都能自己制造。在奥得河口的斯才新港，我看到了一座造船厂在制造许多三千吨的货船。更大的轮船在革旦斯克和革丁尼亚港口制造着。波兰在解放后在波罗的海有五百多公里海岸线。它在一九五五年制造的商船吨数将比在一九四九年增长两倍，比战前增长得更多。它的商船通航到亚洲、南美洲、地中海和欧洲的许多国家。
    在波兰，我还看到许多工厂，如波兹南附近的重型车床和机车工厂、农机工厂，华沙附近的拖拉机工厂、汽车工厂。这些工厂都是在战后新建或改建的。波兰的机器制造业解放前的基础是很薄弱的，人民政权建立以后的年份中才大大发展起来。按照人口计算，现在它生产的机器为战前的九倍，其中金属加工车床为战前的十五倍。
    波兰现有七百个城市。由于正确地实现生产力合理分布的原则，国内工业发展不平衡的状况已经改变。百分之八十新兴的工业企业出现在原来工业不发达的地区。在华沙周围建立了约四十个企业，包括一座钢铁厂。
    在波兰各个工业区，到处可以见到苏联大公无私的援助，那是波兰工业顺利地前进的重要条件。华沙汽车工厂的全套设备，是苏联高尔基汽车工厂代设计的，所出产的汽车和苏联“胜利牌”汽车一模一样。列宁钢铁联合企业也是苏联帮助设计的，全企业的基本机器也是苏联供给的。
    优先发展重工业，使人民波兰在短短期间成长为欧洲第一流工业国。现在波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导之下，正在继续优先发展重工业的基础上，注意大力发展农业合作化和提高农业生产，以求农业能够和迅速发展的工业相适应，并加强作为人民政权的基础的工农联盟。
    今年是波兰发展国民经济的六年计划的最后一年。波兰全国各业劳动者都在为完成六年计划而努力。无疑的，波兰将在完成六年计划中更进一步发展它的工业和农业，对和平、民主、社会主义事业作出更大贡献。
