Xinhua News Agency, via Antara News Agency: Indonesian President Sukarno solemnly declared during a mass rally attended by tens of thousands of people in Padang, Central Sumatra, on the 6th, that the documents he mentioned regarding the imperialists' conspiracy to subvert the Republic of Indonesia were by no means fabricated.

Sukarno emphasized: The imperialists' Plan A (short-term plan) has already failed, but Plan B (long-term plan) is still being implemented. The President said: "I urge the people to pay full attention to these documents, because Plan B is aimed at dividing the Indonesian people. The source of the imperialists' strength in other countries is creating divisions among us."

Sukarno called on the people to unite against the imperialists, and not to beg them for anything.

Prior to this, President Sukarno delivered a speech at a mass rally attended by 400,000 people in Medan. He once again called on the people to continue to be loyal to the Indonesian Declaration of Independence. He emphasized that only by achieving 100% independence can a just and prosperous society be established. He also warned the people to choose carefully when voting for members of the Constituent Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 8th: According to newspaper reports, Indonesian President Sukarno said at a mass rally in Palembang on the 7th that diplomatic activities and negotiations are not the only way to recover West Irian, and the absolute condition for victory is to unite the Indonesian people "in a revolutionary way." He said: "Without national unity, diplomatic struggle is useless."

The President told the crowd who came to listen to his speech in the rain: "We vow not to stop fighting until we recover West Irian."

    苏加诺再次号召人民起来反对帝国主义者
    新华社据安塔拉通讯社报道　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺六日在苏门答腊中部峇丹的一次有数万人参加的群众大会上讲话时郑重声明，他所提到过的关于帝国主义者阴谋颠覆印度尼西亚共和国的文件绝不是伪造的。
    苏加诺着重地说：帝国主义者的甲种计划（短期计划）已经遭到了失败，但是，乙种计划（长期计划）还在推行中。总统说：“我要求人民充分注意这些文件，因为乙种计划就是要分裂印度尼西亚人民。帝国主义在别的国家中的力量的来源就是在我们中间制造分裂。”
    苏加诺号召人民团结起来反对帝国主义者，而不要向他们乞求。
    在这以前，苏加诺总统在棉兰一个有四十万人参加的群众大会上发表了演说。他再一次号召人民继续忠于印度尼西亚的独立宣言。他强调说，唯有获得了百分之百的独立，才能建立公正和繁荣的社会。他还警告人民在投票选举制宪议会议员的时候必须慎重地选择。
    据新华社雅加达八日电　据报纸消息：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺七日在巨港举行的一个群众大会上说，外交活动和谈判不是收复西伊里安的唯一道路，取得胜利的绝对条件是“以革命的方式”把印度尼西亚人民团结起来。他说：“没有全国团结，外交斗争是没有用处的。”
    总统对冒雨前来听他演说的群众说：“我们誓不停止战斗，直到我们收复了西伊里安为止。”
