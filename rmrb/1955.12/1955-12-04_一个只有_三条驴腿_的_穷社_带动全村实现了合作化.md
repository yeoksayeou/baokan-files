A "Poor Cooperative" with Only "Three Donkey Legs"
Led the Whole Village to Achieve Cooperation

To the Editor:

The Jianming Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xisishilipu, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, was established in the autumn of 1952 by twenty-three poor peasant households. When the cooperative was first established, the entire cooperative had 230 mu of land but only managed to scrape together "three donkey legs." They had neither vehicles nor farm tools. The rich peasants and bad elements in the village ridiculed them as "a bunch of poor bums lumped together!" Some well-to-do middle peasants were also unwilling to organize with them. However, these poor peasants believed in the leadership of the Party and, relying on their own hands, continuously overcame difficulties and bravely advanced on the road of cooperation.

At the beginning, some cooperative members were worried about the lack of means of production in the cooperative and developed the idea of relying on state loans. The Party branch and cooperative director Wang Guofan (branch committee member) educated everyone to give play to the collective strength, overcome difficulties, and create happiness with their own labor. Deputy director Du Kui led seventeen male cooperative members to chop firewood in the mountains thirty miles away; cooperative director Wang Guofan and female Party member Wu Xiuying led the women at home to pound manure and repair terraced fields. After working like this for a period of time, the cooperative members who lacked food had grain, the cooperative added an iron-wheeled cart, one head each of cattle, mules, and donkeys, thirty sheep, and fodder for the livestock, and also bought some odd farm tools, added a set of tofu-making equipment, and opened a tofu workshop.

Then, spring planting arrived. The cooperative had not yet prepared the seeds, and most of the cooperative members had no food to eat. The Party members took the lead in launching mutual assistance and relief among the cooperative members, and finally completed the sowing in a timely manner. Before the autumn harvest, the crops were not yet ripe, and the cooperative members had nothing to eat again. The Party branch and the cooperative affairs committee organized everyone to cut thorny grass buds to exchange for grain, and the government issued a living loan of fifty yuan. In this way, the cooperative overcame numerous difficulties and won the first year of bumper harvest.

The bumper harvest not only increased the actual income of the cooperative members by an average of 60% compared to when they were working individually, but also accumulated public property worth 2,400 yuan. In the past, individual cooperative members wavered and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, but at this time they all expressed that they would "never leave the cooperative for the rest of their lives!" Poor peasants outside the cooperative actively requested to join the cooperative, and even the middle peasants who originally thought that they would suffer by running the cooperative with the poor peasants changed their minds. As a result, forty-six poor peasant households and fourteen middle peasant households voluntarily joined the cooperative, and the cooperative quickly expanded to eighty-three households.

However, after some middle peasants joined the cooperative, they believed that the cooperative should be run in a "decent" and "grand" manner, and advocated that livestock and vehicles should be priced and turned over to the cooperative, and even advocated that the original publicly owned livestock in the cooperative should be turned over to the cooperative at a low price. Therefore, the Party branch and the cooperative affairs committee relied on the poor peasants as the backbone to mobilize all cooperative members to launch discussions, criticize the idea of some middle peasants attempting to take advantage and the proposition that violated the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative. As a result, it was decided that the original publicly owned livestock would be turned over to the cooperative at a reasonable price and paid off in three years, and a method of giving a certain remuneration for privately owned equipment used by the cooperative was set for the newly joined members. This avoided the tendency to blindly expand public property and ensured that the middle peasants and poor peasants did not suffer losses. After this, some middle peasant cooperative members proposed that it was better to engage in transportation, oil pressing, and other sideline businesses with more income than engaging in hard work such as chopping firewood and cutting grass. The Party branch led the cooperative members to repeatedly discuss this issue, criticizing and overcoming the greedy and ambitious idea of wanting to "become fat with one bite." Because the cooperative adhered to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, it ensured that production increased year by year and income increased for every household. The well-to-do middle peasants outside the cooperative did not want to work individually when they saw this situation. After the autumn of 1954, the cooperative expanded to 148 households and achieved cooperation throughout the village.

Under the leadership of this "poor cooperative," Xisishilipu Village changed its face in three years. In the past, 140 out of 154 households in the village were households lacking food, and the government had to issue more than 50,000 jin of relief grain and one hundred and several tens of pieces of winter clothing to the village every year. This year, the average yield of grain crops in the village increased by more than 83% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative, and the entire village not only has enough grain for itself, but also has a surplus of more than 30,000 jin. The cooperative accumulated public property worth more than 9,500 yuan. The cooperative members have built 183 new houses and planted more than 167,000 poplar trees, turning thousands of mu of barren hills into green forests.

### 一个只有“三条驴腿”的“穷社”  带动全村实现了合作化

    一个只有“三条驴腿”的“穷社”
    带动全村实现了合作化编辑同志：
    河北省遵化县西四十里铺建明农林牧生产合作社，是在一九五二年秋由二十三户贫农办起来的。社刚成立时，全社二百三十亩地，只凑起了“三条驴腿”，既没有车辆，也缺少农具。村里的富农和坏分子讽刺他们是“穷棒子凑合到一块儿了”！有些富裕中农也不愿意跟他们组织在一起。可是，这些贫农相信党的领导，依靠自己的双手，在合作化道路上不断克服困难，勇敢地前进。
    开头，有的社员为社里缺少生产资料而发愁，产生了依靠向国家贷款的思想。党支部和社长王国藩（支部委员）就教育大家要发挥集体力量，克服困难，用自己的劳动创造幸福。副社长杜奎带着十七个男社员到三十里以外的山上去砍柴；社长王国藩和女党员吴秀英在家领导妇女捣粪和修整梯田。这样干了一段时间，缺粮的社员有了粮食，社里添了铁轮车一辆，牛、骡、驴各一头，羊三十只和牲口的草料，还买了一些零星农具，添置了一套磨豆腐的家具，开了个豆腐坊。
    接着，春播到了。社里种籽还没有准备，大部分社员又没粮食吃了。党员们就带头在社员之间展开了互助互济，终于适时地完成了播种。秋收前庄稼还没熟，社员们又没吃的了。党支部和社务委员会就组织大家割荆草芽子换粮吃，政府又发给了生活贷款五十元。就这样，社里克服了重重困难，赢得了第一个丰收年。
    丰收，不光使社员平均比单干的时候增加了百分之六十的实际收入，而且还积累了价值两千四百元的公共财产。过去有个别社员思想动摇，想退社，这时都表示要“一辈子不出社！”社外的贫农积极要求入社，连原来认为跟贫农在一起办社要吃亏的中农也转变了。于是，有四十六户贫农和十四户中农自愿入了社，社很快扩大到八十三户。
    但是，有些中农入社以后，认为应该把社办得“像样子”“有排场”，主张把牲口、车辆都折价归社，甚至还主张把社里原有的公有牲口低价归社。于是，党支部和社务委员会就依靠贫农为骨干发动全体社员展开讨论，批判了某些中农企图占便宜的思想和违反勤俭办社方针的主张，结果决定将原来公有的牲畜按合理价格归社，三年还清，对新入社的订出了私有伙用给一定报酬的办法。这样就避免了盲目扩大公有财产的偏向，做到了中农、贫农互不吃亏。在这以后，又有一部分中农社员提出搞砍柴、割草等辛苦的活不如搞运输、榨油等副业收入多。党支部又领导社员们反复讨论了这个问题，批判和克服了想“一口吃成个胖子”的贪多、贪大思想。由于社里坚持了勤俭办社的方针，就保证了年年提高生产，户户增加收入。社外的富裕中农看到这种光景，也不愿意单干下去了。一九五四年秋后，社又扩大到一百四十八户，实现了全村合作化。
    在这个“穷棒子社”的带动下，西四十里铺村在三年的时间里就改变了面貌。过去全村一百五十四户中有一百四十户是缺粮户，政府每年都要发给这村五万斤以上的救济粮和一百几十件寒衣。今年村里粮食作物平均产量比建社前增加百分之八十三以上，全村粮食不但可以自足，而且有余粮三万多斤。社里积累起价值九千五百多元的公共财产。社员们已经盖起了一百八十三间新房，栽种了十六万七千多棵杨树，使千亩荒山变成了绿林。
