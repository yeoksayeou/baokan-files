On an evening in November, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Nationalities Cultural Troupe held a brilliant song and dance performance at the open-air theater in Yunjinghong, the seat of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee. The troupe performed more than ten programs at the evening, each of which won enthusiastic applause and cheers from more than a thousand spectators. The most captivating of these was the "Dai Peacock Dance." This dance depicts seven peacock sisters flying to a lotus pond in the forest, taking off their peacock dresses, and transforming into seven beautiful girls, swimming and singing joyfully in the pond. This dance is based on an ancient Dai folk legend. It reflects the lively character of the Dai people and their desire for a peaceful life.

The Xishuangbanna Nationalities Cultural Troupe consists of twenty-five members from five ethnic groups, including eighteen young people and teenagers from the Dai and Hani ethnic groups of the autonomous prefecture. When the troupe was established last September, most of the members were still unfamiliar with literary and artistic work. Encouraged by the Autonomous Prefecture's Communist Party organization and the People's Committee, and with the help of literary and artistic workers sent by the Yunnan Provincial Cultural Bureau, they diligently studied culture, music theory, basic dance movements, and various literary and artistic knowledge, and have made rapid progress over the past year. Two Dai members who were learning musical instruments initially did not even recognize numbered musical notation, but now some can recognize staff notation and can play dozens of practice pieces on the violin and accordion. Kang Langla, the Dai captain of the troupe, with the help of cadres sent by the Yunnan Provincial Cultural Bureau, created Dai songs such as "Ode to Chairman Mao" and "Singing of Xishuangbanna," and also improved the Peacock Dance, Flat Drum Dance, and Big Drum Dance, all of which have national characteristics.

This cultural troupe has successively collected dozens of songs, dances, and music materials in the autonomous prefecture's Jinghong, Menghai, Gelanghe, and Hani Autonomous Region. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture enthusiastically helped the growth of their own cultural troupe. When the members went to the Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region to learn Hani dances, Li Hechan, the vice chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, personally translated the songs for them. When the troupe members were studying in Manle Village in Jinghong, the Dai people from several nearby villages came to participate in the performances, and Ai Hong, who was over sixty years old, patiently taught the members skills such as knife play and fist dancing.

    成长中的西双版纳民族文工队
    新华社记者　黄昌禄
    十一月的一个晚上，西双版纳傣族自治州民族文工队在自治州人民委员会所在地允景洪的露天剧场上，举行了一次精采的歌舞晚会。文工队在晚会上一共演出了十多个节目，每个节目都赢得了一千多观众的热烈鼓掌和喝采。其中最引人入胜的是“傣族孔雀舞”。这个舞蹈描述着七个孔雀姊妹，飞到森林中的一个荷花池旁，脱去孔雀衣裙，变成了七个美丽的姑娘，在池中游泳欢唱。这个舞蹈是根据傣族的一个古老的民间传说编成的。它反映了傣族人民活泼的性格和热爱和平生活的愿望。
    西双版纳民族文工队是由五种民族的二十五个队员组成的，其中有自治州的傣族、哈尼族的青年和少年十八人。去年九月文工队成立的时候，大部分队员对文艺工作还是陌生的。他们在自治州中共组织和人民委员会的鼓励下，在云南省文化局派来的文艺工作者的帮助下，刻苦地学习文化、乐理和舞蹈基本动作以及各种文艺知识，一年来进步很快。学习乐器的两个傣族队员，最初连简谱也不认识，现在有的已经认得五线谱，并且能用小提琴和手风琴演奏几十支练习曲子。文工队的傣族队长康朗拉在云南省文化局派来的干部的帮助下，创作了“歌颂毛主席”和“歌唱西双版纳”等傣族歌曲，还改进了孔雀舞、平鼓舞和大鼓舞等具有民族风格的舞蹈。
    这个文工队曾经先后在自治州的版纳景洪、版纳勐海、格朗和哈尼族自治区搜集了几十种歌谣、舞蹈和音乐的素材。自治州各族人民热情地帮助自己的文工队的成长。当队员们到格朗和哈尼族自治区学习哈尼族舞蹈的时候，自治区人民政府副主席李和禅亲自为他们翻译歌曲。文工队员在版纳景洪的曼勒寨学习的时候，附近几个寨子的傣族人民都来参加表演，六十多岁的艾烘还把耍刀和舞拳等技艺耐心地教给了队员。
