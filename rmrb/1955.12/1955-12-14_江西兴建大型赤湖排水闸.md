Jiangxi is building a large-scale Chi Lake drainage sluice gate.

The large-scale Chi Lake drainage sluice gate project in Jiujiang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, has commenced. Chi Lake is located between Jiujiang and Ruichang counties, with a total length of 50 li and a drainage area of over 1,400 square li. Because the port stone sluice gate was destroyed before liberation, the waterway has become increasingly silted up, drainage is impeded, and water levels have risen, seriously threatening agricultural production in the drainage area. In order to develop agricultural production in the Chi Lake basin, the People's Government has conducted multiple surveys and explorations since liberation in 1951. The sluice gate construction project has now begun and is expected to be completed by the end of March next year. After the Chi Lake drainage sluice gate is completed, it is estimated that more than 40,000 mu of land can be reclaimed, and grain production can be increased by more than 5 million jin per year.

    江西兴建大型赤湖排水闸
    江西省九江专区大型赤湖排水闸工程已经开工。赤湖位于九江、瑞昌两县之间，全长五十里，流域面积达一千四百多平方里。因为解放前的港口石闸被毁，水道日益淤浅，排水不畅，渍水增高，严重威胁着流域区的农业生产。为了发展赤湖流域农业生产、解放后从一九五一年起，人民政府就先后进行了多次的测量勘察。目前建闸工程已经开始，预计明年三月底全部完工。赤湖排水闸建成后，计可围垦田地四万多亩，每年可增产粮食五百多万斤。（本报驻南昌记者）
