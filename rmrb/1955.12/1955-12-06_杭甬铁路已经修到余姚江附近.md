Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been built to the vicinity of the Yuyao River and is not far from Ningbo.

The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway started construction from Xiaoshan in 1953 and is expected to reach the Yuyao River bank by the end of this year. The railway passes through densely populated areas with a high volume of passenger traffic. Temporary passenger and freight services have already been opened between Hangzhou and Cixi.

The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway starts from Hangzhou, passing through Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Cixi to Ningbo. The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway connects with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Xiaoshan and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in Hangzhou. Before liberation, there was an old line between Hangzhou and Ningbo, but it was never fully open to traffic. This line was damaged during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The restored line after liberation has some changes in the middle.

    杭甬铁路已经修到余姚江附近
    新华社五日讯　杭（州）甬（江）铁路已经修到余姚江附近，距离宁波不远了。
    杭甬铁路一九五三年开始从萧山修起，今年年底可修到余姚江岸。这条铁路沿线人烟稠密，来往旅客很多。杭州到慈溪之间已经开办客货运临时营业。
    杭甬铁路从杭州起，中途经过萧山、绍兴、余姚、慈溪到宁波。杭甬铁路在萧山和浙赣铁路连接，在杭州和沪杭铁路衔接。解放前杭州宁波间曾有旧线，但从未全线通车。这条线路抗战期间遭受破坏。解放后修复的这条线路，中途有部分变动。
