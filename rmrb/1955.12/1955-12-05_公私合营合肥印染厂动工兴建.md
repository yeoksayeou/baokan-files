    Public-Private Joint Venture Hefei Printing and Dyeing Factory Begins Construction
    The public-private joint venture Hefei Printing and Dyeing Factory has begun construction. This factory is the relocation and reconstruction of the Shanghai Meiguang Printing and Dyeing Factory after it was converted into a public-private joint venture. The reconstructed printing and dyeing factory will be a relatively well-equipped modern factory. It will have increased ventilation, cooling, heat insulation, dust removal, mist extraction, and safety protection equipment. It will also change the unreasonable arrangement of internal equipment in the original factory.
    The construction of the Hefei Printing and Dyeing Factory will not only be able to timely supply the clothing needs of the broad masses of people in Anhui, but also reduce the round-trip freight costs of transporting the gray cloth produced in Anhui Province to Shanghai for processing.
    The first phase of the factory's construction is expected to be completed and put into production in the third quarter of next year, at which time it will be able to produce more than 600,000 bolts of various colored fabrics annually. The second phase of the factory's construction will be carried out during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and the scale will be expanded three times. At the same time, it will also be able to produce various printed fabrics and printed bed sheets and other products.

    公私合营合肥印染厂动工兴建
    公私合营合肥印染厂已经动工建设。这个工厂是上海美光印染厂改为公私合营以后，内迁合肥进行改建的。改建后的印染厂将是一个设备比较完善的现代化工厂。增加了通风、降温、隔热、吸尘、排雾和安全保护等设备。也改变了原来工厂内部设备排列不合理的情况。
    合肥印染厂的兴建，不仅能够及时供应安徽广大人民的衣着需要，而且减少了安徽省内生产的坯布运往上海加工的往返运费。
    这个厂的第一期建厂工程预计在明年第三季度建成并且投入生产，那时每年将可以生产各种色布六十多万匹。第二期建厂工程将在第二个五年计划期间进行，规模将扩大三倍，同时，还可以生产各种印花布和印花被单等产品。
