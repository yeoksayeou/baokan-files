Northwestern Industrial Architectural Design Institute
    Begins Next Year's Design Work

    Having completed this year's heavy design tasks ahead of schedule, the Northwestern Industrial Architectural Design Institute has started on the engineering design for 1956 since November. All design personnel are working to complete the drawings needed for full-scale construction in the first quarter of next year.

    The total workload of the design tasks undertaken by the institute this year is more than double the area completed in 1953 and 1954 combined. Moreover, the technical requirements are high, and the time for issuing drawings is tight. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and higher authorities, all design personnel, after studying Comrade Khrushchev's report on architectural issues and the documents of the All-Soviet Conference of Construction Workers, further clarified the design philosophy of "suitability, economy, and, where possible, attention to aesthetics." They also criticized the erroneous thinking in past designs that neglected economy and suitability and simply pursued aesthetics. Later, they studied the relevant documents of the Central Committee's instructions on comprehensively reducing construction costs. Based on the improved thinking of all design personnel, coupled with the strong support from provincial and municipal design companies and the Northeast and East China design institutes, the institute completed the year's design tasks ahead of schedule, ensuring the progress of construction and saving more than 16 million yuan.

    西北工业建筑设计院
    开始进行明年设计工作
    西北工业建筑设计院在提前完成了今年繁重的设计任务之后，从十一月起，已经着手进行一九五六年的工程设计。全体设计人员正在为完成供给明年第一季度全面施工所需要的图纸进行工作。
    该院今年所担负的设计任务的全部工作量，比一九五三年和一九五四年两年完成的面积还要大一倍以上，而且技术要求高，出图时间也很紧。但是由于全体设计人员在党和上级的正确领导下，学习了赫鲁晓夫同志有关建筑问题的报告和全苏建筑工作者会议文件以后，进一步明确地认识了“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的设计思想，并对已往设计中忽视经济、适用，单纯讲求美观的错误思想进行了批判，以后又学习了中央全面降低建筑造价指示的有关文件。在全体设计人员思想提高的基础上，加上省、市设计公司和东北、华东设计院的大力支援，所以提前完成了全年的设计任务，保证了施工进度，并且节省了一千六百多万元。
