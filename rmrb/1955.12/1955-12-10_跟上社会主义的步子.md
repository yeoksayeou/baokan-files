    The Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative’s plan to supply more than 20,000 new-style farm tools this year has already seen over 90% dispatched to the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives by mid-November, greatly supplying the peasants. Due to the development of the cooperative movement, the provincial cooperative also foresaw the urgent need for peasants to be supplied with new-style farm tools and has tentatively drafted a plan for the supply of new-style farm tools next year: it is expected that the supply of double-wheeled, double-shared plows will increase by one time compared to this year. In order to ensure the supply of new-style farm tools, the provincial cooperative has also decided to transfer 12,000 double-wheeled, double-shared plows and mountain plows in advance before the new year to support peasant production. The measures taken by the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative are completely in line with the requirements of cooperative development.
    The Tianjin Suburban Supply and Marketing Cooperative Managerial Department is in a different situation. Currently, the double-wheeled, double-shared plows managed by this managerial department are already out of stock. Many local agricultural production cooperatives have been delayed in their winter plowing because they cannot buy double-shared plows. With the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, a high tide of agricultural production increase is bound to appear next spring. At present, the supply and marketing cooperative should formulate a supply plan for production materials for next spring based on this development trend and start various preparations. Time is not ample; however, this managerial department has not seriously studied this issue, so that the fourth quarter of this year is about to pass, and the supply plan for production materials for next spring is still lacking a starting point.
    This practice is very dangerous. The Tianjin Suburban Supply and Marketing Cooperative Managerial Department should quickly change this practice, immediately take measures to strengthen the supply of production materials, and keep up with the pace of socialism.

    跟上社会主义的步子
    陕西省供销合作总社今年全年计划供应的两万多部新式农具，到十一月中旬已有百分之九十以上发往各基层供销社，大量供应农民。由于合作化运动的发展，省社还预见到农民迫切需要供应新式农具，已初步拟出明年供应新式农具的计划：预计双轮双铧犁的供应将要比今年增长一倍。为了保证新式农具的供应，省社并决定在年前还要提前调运一万二千部双轮双铧犁和山地犁支援农民生产。陕西省供销社所采取的措施是完全符合合作化发展的要求的。
    天津市郊区供销社经理部却是另外一种情况。现在，这个经理部经营的双轮双铧犁已经脱销了。当地许多农业生产合作社因为买不到双铧犁而耽误了冬耕。随着农业合作化运动的大发展，明年春天必然要出现一个农业增产运动的高潮。当前，供销社理当根据这一发展趋势制定出明春生产资料的供应计划并着手各项准备工作，时间也不算充裕了；但是这个经理部却根本没有认真地研究过这个问题，以致今年第四季度就要过去了，而明春的生产资料供应计划还没有头绪。
    这种作法是很危险的。天津市郊区供销社经理部应该赶快改变这种作法，立即采取措施加强生产资料的供应工作，跟上社会主义的步子。
