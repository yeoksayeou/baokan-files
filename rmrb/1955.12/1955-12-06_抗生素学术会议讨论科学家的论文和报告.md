Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The 1955 Academic Conference on Antibiotics heard and discussed 48 academic papers and research reports presented by Chinese and foreign scientists from the 2nd to the 5th.

From the 2nd to the 4th, Chinese scientists presented a total of 43 papers and reports, covering research work on the physiology, selection, breeding, and fermentation of antibiotic-producing bacteria, as well as the extraction, refining, chemistry, analysis, identification, antibacterial mechanisms, and clinical applications of various important antibiotics. The authors of these papers and reports included researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, researchers and engineers from industrial departments, professors from universities, and medical scientists from health departments, totaling more than 100 people. Among them were Wang You, Yin Hongzhang, Tong Cun, Yan Xunchu, Gao Yisheng, Huang Yaozeng, Shen Jiaxiang, Liu Peinan, Guo Keda, Zhang Weishen, Shen Shanjiong, Jiang Mingqian, Fu Zhengkai, Yin Xinyun, Jin Peisong, Chen Shanhuan, and others.

Yan Xunchu, a microbiologist, presented two papers on the classification and identification of antibiotic-producing bacteria, which aroused the interest of Corresponding Academician Krasilnikov, a Soviet microbiologist, and others. Krasilnikov believed that Yan Xunchu's "Classification and Identification of Actinomycetes" and "Identification of Several Antagonistic Actinomycetes" correctly pointed out that the problem of actinomycete classification should be studied from the perspective of morphology combined with physiology. He said that the United States was not doing a satisfactory job in this regard. He also praised Guo Keda's method of systematically observing the evolution of microorganisms directly from the microscope, as proposed in "Micro-culture Method of Antibiotic Actinomycetes." He also pointed out that Yan Xunchu and others' papers on the investigation of actinomycetes were valuable because they paid attention to the living conditions of actinomycetes and their relationship with the environment. Krasilnikov also pointed out the shortcomings of these papers. After listening to many papers and reports by Chinese scientists, Japanese agricultural chemist Sumiki Yusuke expressed his admiration for China's ability to achieve such results in two or three years. He said he believed that Chinese scientists who worked hard would soon find good new antibiotics. During the discussion of the papers and reports of Chinese scientists, Soviet consultant Rafikov of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as scientist representatives from Poland, Bulgaria, and other countries, put forward valuable opinions.

At the meeting on the 5th, Soviet microbiologist Savich presented a report on the new antibiotic "Binan" obtained from the spore plant "lichen." He introduced in detail the extensive work carried out by Soviet scientists in this regard. The Soviet Union has officially used "Binan" preparations this year to treat some refractory surgical diseases. Sumiki Yusuke presented two research reports on new anti-tuberculosis antibiotics. These two new antibiotics have considerable inhibitory effects on tuberculosis bacteria and are very low in toxicity. Popov, a Bulgarian mycologist, presented a paper on "Practical Problems of Antibiotics," which elucidated the reasons why microorganisms develop drug resistance to antibiotics and the ways to overcome this phenomenon; and described the application of certain drugs to reduce the toxicity of antitoxins to the body. Yalinpil, a Mongolian microbiologist, made a "Report on the Application of Antibiotics in Medical Institutions in the Mongolian People's Republic." At the meeting, Chinese and foreign scientists were very interested in these papers and engaged in heated discussions, promoting international academic exchanges.

    抗生素学术会议讨论科学家的论文和报告
    新华社五日讯　一九五五年抗生素学术会议在二日到五日听了并且讨论了中外科学家提出的四十八篇学术论文和研究报告。
    二日到四日，中国科学家提出的论文和报告共有四十三篇，内容包括了抗生菌的生理、选育、发酵和各种重要抗生素的提取、精制、化学、分析鉴定、制菌作用原理以及临床应用等方面的研究工作。这些论文和报告的作者有中国科学院的研究人员、工业部门的研究人员和工程师、高等学校的教授以及卫生部门的医学家等共一百多人。其中有汪猷、殷宏章、童村、阎逊初、高怡生、黄耀曾、沈家祥、刘培楠、郭可大、张为申、沈善炯、蒋明谦、傅正恺、尹莘耘、金培松、陈善晃等人。
    微生物学家阎逊初提出的两篇有关抗生菌分类和鉴定的论文引起了苏联微生物学家克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士等人的兴趣。克拉西尔尼科夫认为阎逊初的“放线菌目的分类和鉴定”和“几种颉颃性放线菌的鉴定”指出的以形态为主并结合生理的观点来研究放线菌分类问题是正确的，他说美国在这方面还做得不能令人满意。他还赞扬郭可大的在“抗生性放线菌的微量培养法”中提出的从显微镜中直接对微生物演变进行系统观察的方法。他并且指出阎逊初等人的关于调查放线菌的论文能够注意到放线菌的生活条件以及它同环境的关系，所以有一定的价值。克拉西尔尼科夫同时也指出了这些论文的缺点。日本农业化学家住木谕介听了中国科学家的许多论文和报告以后，对中国能够在两三年内作出这样的成绩表示钦佩。他说他相信认真努力工作的中国科学家不久一定会找到好的新抗生素的。在讨论中国科学家的论文和报告的时候，中国科学院苏联顾问拉菲柯夫以及波兰、保加利亚等国的科学家代表都提出了宝贵的意见。
    在五日的会议上，苏联微生物学家萨维奇提出了从孢子植物“地衣”获得的新抗生素“比南”的报告。他详细地介绍了苏联科学家在这方面所进行的大量工作。苏联已从今年正式使用“比南”制剂来治疗一些难治的外科疾病。住木谕介提出了两篇新的抗结核菌抗生素的研究报告。这两种新抗生素对结核菌有相当的抑制作用，而且毒性很小。保加利亚霉菌学家波波夫提出的“抗生素的实用问题”的论文，阐明了微生物对抗生素产生抗药性的原因以及克服这一现象的途径；并且叙述了应用某些药物减低抗毒素对于机体毒性的影响。蒙古微生物学家雅林皮尔作了“在蒙古人民共和国医疗机构内抗生素的应用问题的报告”。会上，中外科学家对这些论文都很感兴趣，展开了热烈的讨论，促进了国际间学术的交流。
