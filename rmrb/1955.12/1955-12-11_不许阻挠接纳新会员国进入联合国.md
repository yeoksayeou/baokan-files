No Obstruction to the Admission of New Member States to the United Nations

The United Nations General Assembly, in its plenary session on December 8, passed by an overwhelming majority the proposal of Canada and 27 other countries concerning the simultaneous admission of 18 applicant states to the United Nations. This clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of member states in the United Nations oppose the United States' discriminatory policy towards peaceful and democratic countries on the issue of admitting new member states. They hope that the United Nations will have broad universality of membership, making it a truly world organization worthy of the name.

The passage of the joint proposal of 28 countries reflects the growing trend of countries around the world wishing to promote international cooperation. After the end of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, some individuals with ulterior motives vigorously promoted the idea that the "Geneva spirit" had vanished, attempting to re-envelop the world in the bad atmosphere of the "Cold War." These people insisted that establishing international trust and conducting peaceful cooperation between East and West was seemingly impossible. It is now proven that many countries holding the desire to further ease the international situation have not been misled by this argument. They advocate the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, hoping to improve relations between countries and strengthen world peace.

The proposal passed by the Special Political Committee of the UN General Assembly requests the Security Council to "consider all outstanding applications of the eighteen countries that do not present a problem of unification, taking into account the general opinion that the United Nations should include the broadest possible membership." The Security Council should make a decision without hesitation that conforms to the common will of the vast majority of member states of the United Nations, so that the issue of admitting new member states can be resolved during this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

It is worth noting that even now, some people are still carrying out obstruction and sabotage activities on this issue. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique openly expressed its opposition to the solemn recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly, threatening to prevent the Security Council from taking active measures based on the General Assembly's recommendations to break the deadlock in admitting new member states. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has long been spurned by all honest people around the world. It occupies the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and cannot represent anyone at all. What does it mean that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is now shouting and clamoring to carry out sabotage?

This can only show that the person who is fostering it wants to continue to obstruct the resolution of the issue of admitting new member states. As "The Washington Post and Times Herald" said: "It is difficult to believe that the United States has not encouraged Chiang Kai-shek to take this uncompromising attitude." At the same time, everyone understands that when the United Nations General Assembly voted on the joint proposal of 28 countries, the United States only abstained from voting because it did not dare to openly offend the will of the vast majority of countries. In reality, its stubborn stance of opposing peaceful and democratic countries from entering the United Nations has not changed. U.S. representative to the United Nations, Lodge, still viciously slandered Bulgaria and five other peaceful and democratic countries at the Special Political Committee of the UN General Assembly on December 7, and declared that the United States would continue not to support their accession to the United Nations. Therefore, the unscrupulousness of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is not surprising.

However, the policymakers of the United States must be reminded once again: the common will of the vast majority of member states of the United Nations cannot be ignored. No matter what puppet groups they let come forward to carry out sabotage, they cannot escape the responsibility if the deadlock in the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations cannot be broken.

### 不许阻挠接纳新会员国进入联合国

    不许阻挠接纳新会员国进入联合国
    联合国大会十二月八日的全体会议以绝大多数通过了加拿大等二十八国关于同时接纳十八个申请国家加入联合国的提案。这清楚地表明，联合国中的绝大部分会员国是反对美国在接纳新会员国问题上对和平民主国家采取歧视政策的立场的，他们希望联合国的会员具有广泛的普遍性，使它真正成为一个名符其实的世界组织。
    二十八国联合提案的通过，反映了世界各国希望促进国际合作的日益增强的趋向。四国外长会议结束之后，某些别有用心的人就大肆宣传“日内瓦精神”已烟消云散，企图使世界重新被笼罩在“冷战”的恶劣气氛之中。这些人硬说在东西方之间建立国际信任和进行和平合作仿佛是不可能的。现在证明，许多抱有促使国际局势进一步和缓的愿望的国家，并没有被这种论调所迷惑，它们赞成不同社会制度的国家和平共处，希望改善国家之间的关系和加强世界和平。
    联大特别政委会通过的提案，要求安全理事会“根据赞成联合国应包括尽可能广泛的会员国的普遍意见来考虑所有不发生统一问题的十八个国家要求加入联合国的悬而未决的申请”。安理会应当毫不犹豫地作出符合联合国绝大多数会员国共同意志的决定，以便使接纳新会员国问题可以在本届联合国大会中获得解决。
    值得注意的是，直到现在仍然有人在这个问题上继续进行阻挠和破坏活动。蒋介石卖国集团就公然表示反对联合国大会的庄严建议，扬言要阻止安理会根据联大的建议采取积极的措施来打开接纳新会员国的僵局。蒋介石卖国集团早就为全世界正直人民所唾弃，它在联合国中窃踞着中华人民共和国的席位，根本就不能代表任何人。现在蒋介石卖国集团大喊大叫要进行破坏，这说明什么呢？
    这只能说明豢养它的人要继续阻挠解决接纳新会员国问题。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”就这样说：“很难使人相信美国没有鼓励蒋介石采取这种不妥协的态度”。同时大家也明白，在联合国大会表决二十八国联合提案的时候，美国只是因为不敢公然触犯绝大多数国家的意志才投了弃权票，实际上它反对和平民主国家进入联合国的顽固立场并未改变。美国出席联合国的代表洛奇十二月七日在联大特别政治委员会上就仍然对保加利亚等五个和平民主国家进行恶毒的诽谤，并声言美国继续不支持它们加入联合国。因此，蒋介石集团的肆无忌惮也就不是什么奇怪的事情了。
    但是，必须再一次提醒美国的决策者：联合国绝大多数会员国的共同意志是不容忽视的。不管他们让什么傀儡集团出面进行破坏，如果联合国接纳新会员国问题的僵局不能打开，他们是不能逃避应负的责任的。
