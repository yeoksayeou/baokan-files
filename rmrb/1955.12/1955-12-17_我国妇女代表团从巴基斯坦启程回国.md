Li Dequan said: "China and Pakistan are neighboring countries and have many things in common. The people of both countries love peace. Although the two countries have different social and political systems, this does not hinder peaceful coexistence." Li Dequan expressed her hope that trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries would increase day by day. She said that more understanding between each other can not only promote the development of friendship between the two countries, but also contribute to the broad solidarity and cooperation among the people of Asia and the world. After the meeting, Li Dequan made a broadcast recording at the invitation of Pakistan Radio. Subsequently, Li Dequan gave a speech at the invitation of the Pakistan Foreign Affairs Society. She reported on the activities of women in New China in various fields.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th: A Lahore dispatch reports: On December 7th, the Lahore "Civil & Military Gazette" published an editorial entitled "Sino-Pakistani Friendship" to welcome the Chinese Women's Delegation to Pakistan.

The editorial said: "China is a country of wisdom and one of the cradles of culture, where countless great sages have sent messages of peace and goodwill to mankind. It occupies a respected place in the hearts of our people. There is a saying of the Prophet: 'Seek knowledge, even unto China.' This saying proves the leading position that China has occupied in human culture since ancient times."

The editorial said, "Our people are greatly satisfied with the fact that under the new regime, Chinese Muslims enjoy complete religious freedom and equal opportunities for advancement as citizens of the People's Republic—a fact that has been confirmed by successive Pakistani delegations to China. The people of Pakistan are very keen to develop closer cultural and economic relations with China. The visit of the Chinese Women's Delegation will undoubtedly be a milestone towards this ideal."

    我国妇女代表团从巴基斯坦启程回国
    据新华社十六日讯  喀喇蚩消息：应全巴基斯坦妇女协会邀请到巴基斯坦进行友好访问的中国妇女代表团已经在十二月十五日上午乘飞机离开喀喇蚩返国。
    在代表团启程之前，巴基斯坦外交部长哈米杜尔·胡克·乔德里代表巴基斯坦政府到国宾馆向代表团赠礼。
    十二月十三日，代表团团长李德全举行了记者招待会。李德全在会上首先对巴基斯坦政府和全巴基斯坦妇女协会的款待以及巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的友好表示谢意。
    李德全在谈到在三个多星期的访问中获得的印象说：“巴基斯坦是美丽而丰饶的，有着古老而优良的文化传统，人民是勤劳的，他们为建设自己的生活在努力工作着。”
    李德全说：“中国和巴基斯坦两国是邻邦，两个国家有着许多共同点，两国人民都热爱和平，尽管两国的社会、政治制度不同，但是并不妨碍和平共处”。李德全表示，希望两国之间的贸易往来和文化交流日益增进。她说，彼此之间更多的了解不仅能够促进两国之间友谊的发展，而且有助于亚洲人民以及世界各国人民之间的广泛团结和合作。会后，李德全应巴基斯坦电台的邀请作了广播录音。接着，李德全又应巴基斯坦外交学会的邀请作了演讲。她报告了新中国妇女在各方面的活动的情况。
    新华社新德里十五日电  拉合尔消息：拉合尔“军民报”十二月七日以“中巴友谊”为题发表社论，欢迎中国妇女代表团到巴基斯坦访问。
    社论说：“中国是一个智慧之国和文化摇篮之一，在那里曾经有无数伟大圣贤向人类发出和平和亲善的信息。它在我国人民心目中占有受人尊敬的地位。先知有一句格言：‘要寻求知识，必须到中国去。’这句格言证明自古以来中国在人类文化中所占的领导地位。”
    社论说，“我国人民对以下事实感到很大满意，这就是，在新的政权下，中国穆斯林作为人民共和国的公民享有完全的宗教自由和向前发展的平等机会——这是已经被历次访问中国的巴基斯坦代表团所证实了的一个事实。巴基斯坦人民十分希望同中国发展更密切的文化和经济关系。中国妇女代表团的访问无疑将成为走向这个理想的里程碑。”
