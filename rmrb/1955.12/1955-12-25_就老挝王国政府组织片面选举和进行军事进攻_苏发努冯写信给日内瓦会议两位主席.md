Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 24th: Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, wrote to Eden and Molotov, the two co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on December 14th regarding the Lao Royal Government's organization of unilateral elections and military offensives against the Lao Fighting Units. The letter stated that the actions of the Lao Royal Government have increasingly threatened the implementation of the Geneva Accords, intensifying the situation, and that the Lao Royal Government should bear full responsibility for this situation.

The letter pointed out that the Lao Royal Government has not only not stopped but is continuing and expanding its military offensives against the Lao Fighting Units in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement between the two sides in Yangon, the Lao Royal side has increased its troops in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly and has occupied eleven more strongholds in the two provinces.

The letter also said that regarding the resolution of political issues, the Lao Royal Government rejected the Lao side's proposal at the political conference aimed at guaranteeing free and democratic general elections in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords and blatantly suspended political negotiations. Now, the Lao Royal Government is organizing unilateral elections in the ten provinces under its control, excluding the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel from participating.

The letter pointed out that these actions of the Lao Royal Government are a serious violation of the Geneva Accords and the statement that the Royal Government had made at the Geneva Conference.

Prince Souphanouvong emphasized in the letter that the Lao side's position is:

    One, the Lao Fighting Units have thoroughly and strictly implemented and will continue to thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords related to Laos. The Lao Fighting Units resolutely demand that the relevant parties thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords related to Laos.
    Two, the Lao Royal Government must stop all military actions and halt the offensives against the Lao Fighting Units in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly.
    Three, the Lao Fighting Units resolutely oppose the unilateral elections being organized by the Lao Royal Government in violation of the Geneva Accords. The Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel must be able to participate in the elections.
    Four, the Lao Fighting Units believe that the Lao Royal Government and the French government should bear their responsibilities in implementing the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of hostilities and the resolution of the political issues in Laos.

The letter concluded by saying that the Lao Fighting Units request the chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords related to Laos are respected.

    就老挝王国政府组织片面选举和进行军事进攻
    苏发努冯写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
    新华社河内二十四日电　寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王在十二月十四日就老挝王国政府组织片面选举和向寮国战斗部队进行军事进攻问题，写信给一九五四年日内瓦会议的两位主席艾登和莫洛托夫。信中说，老挝王国政府的行动已经使日内瓦协定的履行遭到日益严重的威胁，使局势日益紧张，老挝王国政府对于这种情况应当负全部责任。
    信中指出，老挝王国政府不但没有停止而且还在继续和扩大向桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队进行军事进攻。从双方在仰光签订停止敌对行动协议到现在，老挝王国方面又增加了它们在桑怒和丰沙里两省的军队，并且又占领了两省的十一个据点。
    信中又说，关于政治问题的解决，老挝王国政府拒绝了寮国方面在政治会议上提出的旨在按照日内瓦协定的规定保证自由和民主的普选的建议，并且公然停止了政治谈判。现在，老挝王国政府正在它们控制下的十个省内组织排斥寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员参加的片面选举。
    信中指出，老挝王国政府的这种行动是严重地违反日内瓦协定和王国政府曾经在日内瓦会议上发表的声明的。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中强调说，寮国方面的立场是：
    一、寮国战斗部队已经并且将继续彻底和严格地执行有关老挝的日内瓦协定。寮国战斗部队坚决要求有关方面彻底和严格地履行有关老挝的日内瓦协定。
    二、老挝王国政府必须停止一切军事行动，制止向桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队的进攻。
    三、寮国战斗部队坚决反对老挝王国政府正在组织的违反日内瓦协定的片面选举，寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员必须能够参加选举。
    四、寮国战斗部队认为老挝王国政府和法国政府在实施有关停止敌对行动和解决老挝政治问题的日内瓦协定中，应当承担起自己的责任。
    信中最后说，寮国战斗部队要求日内瓦会议主席采取一切必要措施，使有关老挝问题的日内瓦协定得到尊重。
