Xinhua News Agency, December 7th—Materials reported at the scientific experiment and research work conference convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry indicate that the economic and technical indicators for iron and steel smelting in our country have reached or are close to the Soviet Union's level in 1952. This year, the main economic and technical indicators of the steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries have significantly improved compared to 1952. This year, the average effective volume of blast furnaces occupied per ton of pig iron smelted in the steel industry was about 0.1 cubic meters less than in 1952; the steel produced per square meter of open hearth furnace bottom averaged more than one ton higher than in 1952. Since the beginning of this year, the efficiency of non-ferrous metal mining has averaged more than 32 tons per shift, while in 1952, the efficiency was only about 24 tons per shift; the actual metal recovery rate in ore dressing production has also greatly improved, with lead increasing by 8.4 percent and zinc by 13.8 percent compared to 1952; the actual metal recovery rate for lead smelting has increased by 5.4 percent and zinc by more than 8 percent compared to 1952. In the building materials industry, the average output per square meter of cement kilns and glass kilns has increased by more than 20 percent compared to 1952. In the chemical industry, indicators such as sulfuric acid recovery rate, caustic soda current efficiency, and salt utilization rate have also improved compared to 1952.
    The significant improvement in various economic and technical indicators of the industrial systems of the Ministry of Heavy Industry shows that workers have produced more products for the country without adding major equipment.
    The report materials of this conference also show that although the main economic and technical indicators of various industrial systems have greatly improved, most of the indicators are still very backward compared with international standards, and they are not stable enough, and there are many problems in quality. According to these circumstances, the conference requested the broad masses of workers in various industrial systems to continue to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, strive to learn advanced technologies, and further improve various economic and technical indicators to create more wealth for the country.

    重工业部系统生产技术水平显著提高
    新华社七日讯重工业部召开的科学试验研究工作会议上所报告的材料说明，目前，我国炼制生铁和钢的经济技术指标，都已经达到或接近苏联一九五二年的水平。今年钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料工业的主要经济技术指标都比一九五二年有了显著提高。今年钢铁工业每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积，平均比一九五二年少用了零点一立方公尺左右；平炉炉底每一平方公尺所产的钢，平均比一九五二年增加了一吨以上。今年以来，有色金属采矿的效率，每台班平均达到三十二吨以上，而在一九五二年每台班的效率还只有二十四吨左右；选矿生产中的金属实收率也有很大提高，其中铅比一九五二年提高百分之八点四，锌提高百分之十三点八；铅冶炼金属实收率比一九五二年提高了百分之五点四、锌提高了百分之八以上。建筑材料工业中的水泥窑和玻璃窑，每平方公尺的产量平均比一九五二年提高百分之二十以上。化学工业方面，硫酸采酸率、烧碱电流效率和食盐利用率等指标，也都比一九五二年有了提高。
    重工业部各产业系统各项经济技术指标的显著提高，表明了职工们在没有增添主要设备的情况下，为国家生产了更多的产品。
    这次会议的报告材料还说明：各产业系统主要经济技术指标虽然有很大提高，但大多数指标同国际水平比起来还很落后，并且不够稳定，在质量上也有很多问题。会议根据这些情况，要求各产业系统的广大职工继续发挥积极性、创造性，努力学习先进技术，进一步提高各项经济技术指标，为国家创造更多的财富。
