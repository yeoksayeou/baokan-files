Many advanced workers in various regions have continued to complete their state plans ahead of schedule.

According to incomplete statistics up to December 10th, employees of ninety factories and enterprises in Beijing have already completed their annual gross output value plans. At the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, more than 160 advanced workers began working on next year's tasks at the beginning of December. Employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, who have exceeded their monthly gross output value plans every month from January to November this year, launched a labor competition throughout the plant to achieve the 1956 production targets ahead of schedule, based on a suggestion made at a meeting on December 1st by the plant's labor models, advanced producers, and engineering technicians. This year, on the basis of increasing pig iron production by 26,276 tons for the whole year, they aim to increase pig iron production by another 6,164 tons.

Following lathe operator Sheng Li and scraper Hu Senrong, who completed five years' worth of work ahead of schedule, now Li Huashan, a gear hobbing worker in the bushing workshop of the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, has also completed five years' worth of work. By the end of November, more than 250 workers at the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory had completed their annual workload. Among them, most of the members of Zhu Shunrong's group (an advanced group in Shanghai's industry in 1954) completed their annual tasks by the end of August.

After the advanced deeds of lathe operator Wang Xinnian of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, who completed three years of work in one year last year, appeared, the broad masses of workers in Shijiazhuang City put forward heroic slogans such as "Marching towards the Five-Year Plan," "Making contributions to socialist construction," and "Competing with Wang Xinnian," quickly launching a new high tide of production competition. After diligent research, Wang Shanxiang, a wheel lathe operator in the locomotive repair workshop of the Freight Car Repair Factory, improved his tools and accelerated the lathe speed, averaging 365 percent of the state quota in the last twenty days of November. He is now working on production scheduled for late January 1956. At present, more than 1,830 advanced workers in Shijiazhuang City have started production for next year, and employees who have completed their annual plans are appearing every day.

The Li Zhengtian youth riveting team of the Anhui Provincial State-owned Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory, which won the honorary title of "Outstanding Youth Advanced Collective" at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, has recently begun working on tasks for January 1957.

By the end of November, 107 youth shock brigades, youth production teams, and groups in Shanxi Province had completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. As of December 5th, in Fushun City, 11 factories and mines, 231 workshops, 526 work sections, and 1,702 groups had also completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

    各地又有许多先进工人提前完成今年计划
    各地继续有许多先进工人提前完成国家计划。
    到十二月十日为止的不完全统计，北京市已经有九十个工厂企业的职工完成了全年总产值计划。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在十二月初，又有一百六十多个先进工人开始作明年的工作。从今年一月到十一月，每月都超额完成总产值计划的石景山钢铁厂的职工，根据这个厂劳动模范、先进生产者和工程技术人员十二月一日在一次会上的建议，在全厂开展一个提前实现一九五六年生产指标的劳动竞赛。今年他们要在全年增产生铁二万六千二百七十六吨的基础上，再增产生铁六千一百六十四吨。
    继车工盛利和刮工胡森荣提前完成五年工作量之后，现在，国营上海机床厂轴套车间滚齿工人李华山，也完成了五年的工作量。上海华通开关厂到十一月底，已经有二百五十多个工人完成了今年的工作量。其中朱顺荣小组（一九五四年上海市工业先进小组）的绝大部分组员，在八月底就完成了全年任务。
    石家庄市机车车辆修理工厂车工王新年去年一年完成三年工作量的先进事迹出现以后，石家庄市广大职工提出“向五年计划进军”、“为社会主义建设立功”、“和王新年竞赛”等豪迈的口号，很快地掀起了一个生产竞赛的新高潮。货车修理工厂修机车间镟工王山祥经过钻研，改进了工具，加快了车床转数，在十一月的后二十天中，平均达到国家定额百分之三百六十五。现在他已经在进行一九五六年一月下旬的生产。目前，石家庄市已经有一千八百三十多名先进工人在开始明年的生产了，并且每天都有完成全年计划的职工出现。
    在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上获得“优秀青年先进集体”光荣称号的安徽省国营蔡家岗矿山机械厂李正田青年铆工组，最近已经开始做一九五七年一月份的工作了。
    山西省到十一月底，有一百零七个青年突击队、青年生产班、组，提前完成了全年计划。抚顺市到十二月五日止，也有十一个厂矿二百三十一个车间，五百二十六个工段，一千七百零二个小组提前完成了全年计划。
