To the Editor:

    The Tangshan Power Plant comprehensively completed this year's national plan on December 15th: Power generation reached 101.03% of the planned target; total output value reached 100.08% of the planned target; plant power consumption was 8.67% lower than planned; standard coal consumption was 1.61% lower than planned; and unit cost was 7% lower than planned.

    Over the past year, the employees of the Tangshan Power Plant have deeply carried out labor emulation drives and fought against accidents, eliminating more than 1,700 major and minor equipment defects, thereby ensuring safe power generation. After receiving technical training, the employees have universally implemented the technical management regulations of the power industry and the operating, maintenance, and accident handling procedures and systems, and have conducted more than 170 accident drills. Everyone's operational skills have greatly improved, thus eliminating accidents caused by operational errors. At the same time, thanks to the plant-wide promotion of advanced experiences such as the "economic combustion card," the "Moirao team's safe operation method," the "Li Xiangrong's safe boiler synchronization method," and the "Wang Junshan team's method of reducing coal consumption," not only was safety guaranteed, but costs were also reduced.

    Now, the employees of the Tangshan Power Plant are continuing to work hard to create greater achievements and prepare for next year's production. Everyone is full of confidence in welcoming the new tasks of the fourth year of the first Five-Year Plan.

    唐山发电厂已经在十二月十五日全面地完成今年国家计划：发电量完成了计划的百分之一百点零三；生产总值完成了计划的一百点零八；厂用电比计划降低了百分之八点六七；标准煤耗比计划降低了百分之一点六一；单位成本比计划降低了百分之七。
    一年来，唐山发电厂的职工深入地开展了劳动竞赛，进行了反事故的斗争，共消除大小设备缺陷达一千七百多处，从而保证了安全发电。职工们在经过技术培养训练以后，普遍地执行了电力工业技术管理法规和运行、检修、事故处理等规程制度，并且进行了一百七十多次的反事故演习。大家的操作技术水平大大地提高了，就杜绝了由于操作错误而造成的事故。同时，由于全厂推广了“经济燃烧卡片”、“么瑞劳小组安全运行法”、“李向荣安全并炉法”和“王均山小组降低煤耗法”等先进经验，不但保证了安全，而且降低了成本。
    现在，唐山发电厂的职工正在为创造更大的成绩和作好明年的生产准备工作而继续努力，大伙都满怀信心地在迎接第一个五年计划第四年度的新任务。
