Last winter, the leaders of the Xili Village First Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, felt that there were too many small animals in the cooperative, which were troublesome to feed and could not work at the moment, so they sold fourteen calves. However, when the spring plowing season came this year, some of the old cattle were no longer usable, and two more cattle died of old age. At this time, everyone began to feel that the original idea was wrong, and if those calves had not been sold, some of them could have been used for plowing this year. The cooperative learned this lesson and recently studied a plan for feeding young livestock in winter. They decided to feed the original thirty-eight small animals in separate troughs and also bought sixteen small animals. Now, the entire cooperative has a total of forty-seven calves and seven donkey foals. To ensure the safe growth of the young livestock, the cooperative also built three new troughs and formulated feeding management methods.

Currently, some agricultural cooperatives still feel that raising small animals is not cost-effective and are preparing to sell them. These cooperatives should learn from the Xili Village First Cooperative's lesson and not just look at immediate interests and make the wrong decisions.

    不能只看眼前
    去年冬季，山西省万荣县西里村第一农业生产合作社的领导人员觉得社里小牲口太多，喂养麻烦，眼下又不能做活，就卖掉了十四头小牛。可是到今年春耕时候，有一部分老牛已经不能使用，还有两头牛老死了。这时，大家开始感到原来的主意打错了，如果那些小牛不卖掉，今年有的就可以耕地了。社里吸取了这个教训，最近研究了冬季喂养幼畜的计划。他们决定把原有的三十八头小牲口分槽喂养，还买了十六头小牲口。现在，全社共有四十七头牛犊，七头驴驹。为了保证幼畜安全生长，社里还新修了三个槽，制定了喂养管理的办法。
    目前还有一些农业合作社觉得喂小牲口不上算，准备出卖小牲口。这些社应该接受西里村第一社的教训，不要只看眼前利益，打错了主意。
