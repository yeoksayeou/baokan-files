    Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 Resolves to Increase Crude Oil Production by 3,000 Tons This Year

To the Editor:

    Our Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 had already fulfilled the state plan for this year twenty-five days ahead of schedule on December 6th. The total output value reached 101.04% of the planned target, an increase of 18.8% compared to last year. Labor productivity reached 101.6% of the planned target, an increase of 32.3% compared to last year. The cost (from January to November) was reduced by 2.98% compared to the plan. Profit delivery to the state was completed 57 days ahead of schedule. The production of five major products, including gasoline, light diesel oil for spring and autumn use, and yellow wax, was also completed 50 to 21 days ahead of schedule.

    This year, our factory earnestly implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, promoted advanced experiences, and carried out rationalization proposals, which greatly improved production. After the gasoline workshop adopted the Soviet expert's suggestions on "preheating raw material oil" and "lowering the inlet pipe," the daily output increased by more than three tons compared to the past. After adopting the suggestion on the "gas absorption tower," two tons of crude gasoline were recovered daily. After the research institute's staff successfully researched and recovered light oil from gas, the annual recovery of light oil reached tens of thousands of tons. Due to the summarization and promotion of the advanced experience of Zhang Tongyi's team in the West Crude Oil Workshop on "different operation methods for different oil shale" and the strengthening of the scheduling and protection of oil shale, from November, our factory reversed the situation of failing to complete the crude oil task month after month. Recently, we even created a new record of exceeding the daily crude oil production plan by 17.8%. During the production increase and conservation campaign, the entire factory promoted the work of economic accounting by work teams. All employees, focusing on "improving refining rates and reducing losses" and "eliminating oil spills and leaks," put forward many rationalization proposals. We adopted the rationalization proposal of "acidifying emulsified oil" proposed by Ma Youshan, a worker in the West Crude Oil Workshop, with the help of technician Li Zhian, which recovered 15 tons more crude oil per day. We adopted the suggestion of Yan Xikai, a worker in the boiler workshop, to "install an oil-water separator to recover light oil from the manhole," which recovered more than one ton of light oil per day. Li Yankui, a technician in the paraffin workshop, and Zhang Wencheng, a foreman, researched a method to reduce the loss of No. 2 light oil, reducing the loss rate of No. 2 light oil from 0.8% to 0.4%. By the end of November, the total loss rate of the entire factory was 2.69% lower than the state plan.

    Currently, all employees of our factory are continuing to strive to achieve the plan of increasing crude oil production by 3,000 tons for the state and delivering an additional 4.32 million yuan in profits to the state by the end of the year!

    抚顺石油一厂决心在年内增产三千吨原油编辑同志：
    我们抚顺石油一厂已经在十二月六日提前二十五天完成了今年的国家计划：生产总值完成计划的百分之一百点零四，比去年增长了百分之十八点八；劳动生产率完成计划的百分之一百零一点六，比去年提高了百分之三十二点三；成本（一月到十一月）比计划降低了百分之二点九八；上缴利润计划提前五十七天完成了；汽油、春秋用轻柴油和黄石蜡等五种主要产品的生产量也提前五十天到二十一天完成了。
    今年，我们工厂认真贯彻了苏联专家的建议，推广了先进经验，开展了合理化建议的工作，因而使生产大大提高了。汽油车间采用了苏联专家关于“原料油预热”和“降低入口管”的建议以后，日产量比过去提高了三吨多；采用了关于“瓦斯吸收塔”的建议以后，每天就回收了二吨粗汽油。研究所的职工研究回收瓦斯中轻质油获得成功以后，每年回收的轻质油达几万吨。由于总结和推广了西原油车间张同义班的“不同页岩不同操作方法”的先进经验，加强了油母页岩的调度和保护，从十一月起，我们厂扭转了原油月月完不成任务的局面，最近并且创造了超过日作业计划百分之十七点八的原油日产量的新纪录。在增产节约运动中，全厂推行了班组经济核算的工作，全体职工围绕着“提高炼率，减少损失”和“消灭跑油、漏油现象”提出了许多合理化建议。我们采纳了西原油车间工人马有山在技术员李智安帮助下提出的“乳化油加酸”的合理化建议，每天就多回收原油十五吨；采纳了汽锅车间工人严熙凯提出的“安装油水分离器，回收马葫芦中轻质油”的建议，每天回收了一吨多轻质油；石蜡车间技术员李衍魁和工长张文成研究出减少二号轻油损失的办法，使二号轻油损失率由百分之零点八减少到零点四。到十一月底，全厂总损失率比国家计划减少了百分之二点六九。
    目前我们全厂职工正在为实现到年底给国家增产三千吨原油和为国家多上缴四百三十二万元利润的计划而继续奋斗！
