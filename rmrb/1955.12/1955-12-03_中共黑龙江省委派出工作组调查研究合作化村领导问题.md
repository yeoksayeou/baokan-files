The working group dispatched by the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee to rural areas to investigate and research leadership issues in cooperative villages has now returned to the province and is concentrating on gathering information and conducting research.

Next spring, the number of peasant households in Heilongjiang Province participating in agricultural cooperatives will reach 70 percent of the total number of peasant households. Therefore, in early November, the Provincial Committee sent people to Keshan, Nehe, and Shuangcheng counties to investigate and research the new situations and new problems in cooperative villages. Each county selected three to five villages to separately investigate issues such as expanding production, how branches lead, how various grassroots organizations adapt to the requirements of the new situation, and the coordination of various economic tasks. The working group responsible for this investigation will provide systematic materials on cooperative villages at the rural work conference to be convened by the Provincial Committee in December, to facilitate research and discussion at the meeting.

    中共黑龙江省委派出工作组调查研究合作化村领导问题
    中共黑龙江省委派赴农村调查研究合作化村领导问题的工作组，现已返省，正集中情况，进行研究工作。
    黑龙江省明春参加农业社农户将达到总农户的百分之七十，因此，省委在十一月上旬派人分赴克山、讷河、双城三个县调查研究合作化村的新情况和新问题。各县都选择三、五个村，分别调查扩大生产、支部怎样领导、各种基层组织怎样适应新形势的要求，以及各种经济工作的配合等。担负此次调查的工作组，将在十二月份省委召开的农村工作会议上提供有关合作化村的系统材料，便于会议的研究和讨论。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
