    Lao's Unilateral Elections Violate the Geneva Accords

    Peace-loving people around the world are closely concerned about the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina. However, in Laos, not only has the ceasefire agreement not been effectively observed, but the Royal Lao Government has also begun unilateral elections on December 25, excluding the Pathet Lao Fighting Units from participating. This situation cannot but arouse serious concern.

    The unilateral elections held by the Royal Lao Government are a complete violation of the Geneva Accords. The final declaration of the Geneva Conference pointed out that the Royal Lao Government must "take measures to enable all citizens to participate in the common life of the nation" and conduct national general elections in 1955; it also stipulated that the general elections should be held "in conditions respecting fundamental freedoms." The Royal Lao Government's representative also guaranteed in a statement issued at the end of the Geneva Conference that "all Lao citizens will be able to freely participate in the general elections by secret ballot as voters and candidates." However, the "election" measures now taken by the Royal Lao Government exclude the participation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and exclude women and other citizens, who account for about half of the country's population. Therefore, out of more than 2 million Lao residents, only about 250,000 people are allowed to participate in the Royal Lao Government's so-called "elections." Such unilateral elections clearly violate the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the guarantees made by the Royal Lao Government itself. It is impossible to express the true will of the Lao people, and this practice can only make the situation in Laos more and more complicated.

    The Pathet Lao Fighting Units have consistently followed the Geneva Accords and actively consulted with the Royal Government, demanding national unification through political conferences to negotiate general elections. Representatives of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units have repeatedly stated that as long as the Royal Government guarantees the realization of free national general elections with the participation of Pathet Lao resistance personnel, then the issue of unifying the administrative institutions of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces into the Royal Government's power will be easily resolved.

    However, the Royal Lao Government is unwilling to take this legitimate approach. It has repeatedly refused consultations and continuously undermined the Geneva Accords. Since the two sides in Laos began holding political meetings on January 18 this year, the Royal Government's representatives have withdrawn from the meetings many times, causing the meetings to be interrupted for a long time. Recently, the Royal Government unreasonably rejected the Pathet Lao Fighting Units' legitimate proposal to hold national general elections in Laos in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and resolve the issues of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces. It also violated the Vientiane Agreement signed by both parties in October this year, suspended the political meetings between the two parties, and launched armed offensives, occupying eleven strongholds in the assembly areas of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units.

    The failure of the Geneva Accords to be fully implemented in Laos and the failure to completely cease hostilities in Laos are inseparable from the United States' intervention in Laos. The United States Department of State has always regarded Laos as an "outpost" of the United States. From January to July 1955, the "aid" provided by the United States to Laos "to establish the Lao army" amounted to 35 million US dollars. The Washington ruling clique has also clamored for and planned for the Manila Treaty Organization to intervene in the situation in Laos. In recent months, the United States has also used airplanes to airdrop a large amount of food to bandits under the command of the Royal Lao Government within Phongsaly. The United States is also actively planning to conclude a "military assistance" agreement with Laos, attempting to completely control the armed forces of the Kingdom of Laos and further threaten peace in Indochina.

    This practice of the United States and the Royal Lao authorities has hindered the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, making the peaceful unification of Laos impossible, thereby seriously damaging the national independence and sovereignty of Laos.

    The problem of Laos cannot be solved by unilateral elections, let alone by force. We fully support the letter written by the representatives of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units to the chairman of the Geneva Conference. For the sake of peace in Indochina and for the benefit of Laos, relevant countries should take measures to fully implement the Geneva Accords in Laos.

### 老挝片面选举违背日内瓦协议

    老挝片面选举违背日内瓦协议
    全世界爱好和平的人民密切地关心着印度支那和平的巩固，关心日内瓦协议在印度支那的全部实施。但是，在老挝，不仅停战协定一直未被切实地遵守，老挝王国政府又于十二月二十五日开始进行片面选举，排除寮国战斗部队参加。这种情况，不能不引起人们的严重关注。
    老挝王国政府举行的片面选举，是完全违背日内瓦协议的。日内瓦会议的最后宣言指出，老挝王国政府必须“采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施”，在一九五五年进行全国普选；并规定普选应“在尊重基本自由的条件下”举行。老挝王国政府代表在日内瓦会议结束时所发表的声明也曾保证：“全体老挝公民都能自由地以选举人和候选人的资格，参加秘密投票的普选”。可是，现在老挝王国政府所采取的“选举”措施，却排除了寮国战斗部队的参加，并排除了约占全国人口一半的妇女和其它公民参加。因此，在二百多万老挝居民中，只有约二十五万人被允许参加老挝王国政府的所谓“选举”。这样的片面选举，显然违反了日内瓦协议的规定和王国政府自己所作的保证，它不可能表达老挝人民的真正意志，这种做法只能使老挝局势越来越复杂化。
    寮国战斗部队一贯地遵循日内瓦协议，积极地同王国政府进行协商，要求通过召开政治会议协商普选的方式来求得国家统一。寮国战斗部队的代表曾一再申明，只要王国政府保证实现有寮国抗战人员参加的全国自由普选，那末，把桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政机构统一到王国政权中去的问题将是容易解决的。
    但是，老挝王国政府不愿采取这个正当的办法，它多方拒绝协商，并使日内瓦协议不断受到破坏。自从今年一月十八日老挝双方开始举行政治会议以后，王国政府的代表多次退出会议，使会议长期中断。最近，王国政府又无理地拒绝了寮国战斗部队关于依照日内瓦协议的精神举行老挝全国普选和解决桑怒、丰沙里两省问题的正当建议。它并且违背今年十月间双方签订的仰光协议，中止了双方的政治会议，发动武装进攻，侵占了寮国战斗部队集结区的十一个据点。
    日内瓦协议在老挝未能得到全部执行，老挝的敌对行动未能完全停止，是同美国对老挝的干涉分不开的。美国国务院一直把老挝当作美国的“前哨”，一九五五年一月至七月，美国向老挝提供的“用来建立老挝的军队”的“援助”已达三千五百万美元。华盛顿统治集团并曾叫嚣和策划马尼拉条约组织对老挝局势进行干涉。近几个月来，美国又用飞机空投了大批粮食给丰沙里境内受老挝王国政府指挥的土匪。美国还在积极策划同老挝缔结“军事援助”协定，企图完全控制老挝王国的武装部队，进一步威胁印度支那和平。
    美国和老挝王国当局的这种作法，阻碍了日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，使老挝的和平统一无法实现，从而严重地损害了老挝的民族独立和主权的利益。
    老挝的问题既不可能用片面选举来解决，更不可能用武力来解决。我们完全支持寮国战斗部队代表写给日内瓦会议主席的信。为了印度支那的和平、为了老挝的利益，有关国家应该采取措施，使日内瓦协议在老挝完全实施。
