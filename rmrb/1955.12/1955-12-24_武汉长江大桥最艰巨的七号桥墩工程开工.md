Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 23rd: Construction of Pier No. 7, the most complex and difficult of the eight piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, began on the 22nd. On this day, bridge builders at the site of Pier No. 7 operated eight electric winches and steel derricks to sink the huge steel cofferdam into the turbulent Yangtze River for the first time. So far, a total of six piers are under construction on the Yangtze River simultaneously.

Now, the water level of the Yangtze River has receded to near its lowest historical level, which is the best construction season for the foundation work of the Yangtze River Bridge. Personnel from the First and Second Bridge Engineering Teams of the bridge construction are launching a labor emulation campaign to complete the bridge ahead of schedule. Six piers in the middle of the river are crisscrossing with the preparation work of sinking cofferdams, inserting steel sheet pile cofferdams, drilling holes in the riverbed, and underwater concrete pouring. Workers who install and hoist have completed the on-site cleaning work ahead of schedule, and have used wooden barges instead of iron barges to transport large impact drilling rigs, so that the rock drilling work of Pier No. 8 started five days ahead of schedule.

The builders of the Yangtze River Bridge only started the experimental work of the world's latest bridge construction method - "pipe pile drilling method" on the left bank of the Yangtze River in early spring this year. With the help of Soviet experts, they have now mastered the technology of this new construction method relatively skillfully. In the past, it took two months to make a steel cofferdam for one pier, but now it can be done in twenty days; initially, it took seven days to sink a large pipe pile, but now it can sink four in one day; the record of drilling into the riverbed with a large impact drilling rig has also been increased from one hole in six days to an average of one hole in one day. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has added construction and installation plans twice this year. The original plan was to have only two piers under construction in the middle of the river, but now six piers are under construction simultaneously.

### 武汉长江大桥最艰巨的七号桥墩工程开工

    武汉长江大桥最艰巨的七号桥墩工程开工
    新华社武汉二十三日电　武汉长江大桥八个桥墩中最复杂和艰巨的七号桥墩工程，已经在二十二日开始施工。这一天，桥梁建设者们在七号桥墩墩址上操纵着八部电动绞车和钢吊架，把巨大的钢围囹第一次沉入长江激流中。到目前为止，在长江江面上同时施工的共有六个桥墩。
    现在，武汉长江水位退落到接近历史上最低水位，正是长江大桥基础工程最好的施工季节。建设桥梁的第一和第二桥梁工程队的人员，展开了提前建成大桥的劳动竞赛。江心六个桥墩正在交叉进行着下沉围囹、插筑钢板围堰、在江底钻孔和在水下灌注混凝土的准备工作。装吊工人们提前做好了现场清理工作，并且以木驳船代替铁驳船运输冲击式大型钻机，使八号桥墩的钻岩工作提前五天开工。
    长江大桥的建设者们，今年初春才在长江左岸开始进行世界上最新的桥梁施工方法——“管柱钻孔法”的试验工作。在苏联专家的帮助下，他们现在已经比较熟练地掌握了这个新施工法的技术。过去两个月才做一个桥墩钢围囹，现在二十天就可以做一个；最初，七天下沉一根大型管柱，现在一天就可以下沉四根；用冲击式大型钻机向江底钻岩的纪录，也由六天一孔提高到平均一天一孔。武汉长江大桥工程局今年曾经两次追加了建筑安装计划。原来计划在江心只有两个桥墩开工，现在已经有六个桥墩在同时施工。
