	112-Type Automatic Lathe

	China's first automatic lathe – the Soviet-style 112-type single-spindle Swiss-type automatic lathe – has been successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Nanjing Machine Tool Plant. Small-batch trial production is now underway, and mass production will begin next year.
	The Soviet-style 112-type single-spindle Swiss-type automatic lathe is a new type of machine tool. It can process workpieces with diameters ranging from 12 mm to 5 mm, and can perform operations such as turning outer circles, cutting grooves, template tool cutting, reaming threads, and drilling, manufacturing mechanical parts with high precision and complex shapes. It is most suitable for the production needs of automobile factories, tractor factories, ball bearing factories, and instrument factories.
	This lathe has very high production efficiency, with a headstock speed of up to 7,000 revolutions per minute, which is eight times higher than that of ordinary lathes. Since the entire machining process of the parts is automated, workers with lower technical grades can operate it after the lathe is adjusted, and a highly skilled worker can supervise five or six machines at the same time.
	The Soviet-style 112-type single-spindle Swiss-type automatic lathe was trial-produced according to Soviet blueprints. Before the trial production, many workers and technicians had never seen this type of lathe, and encountered many difficulties during the trial production process. For example, the maximum speed of the spindle is more than 7,000 revolutions per minute, which is more than three times higher than the maximum speed of the sliding bearings of the machine tools previously manufactured by the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant. How to prevent the bearing from overheating and the machine tool from vibrating at high speed to ensure the accuracy of each part to be processed in the future was the most difficult problem facing the employees of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant who participated in the trial production. The leadership mobilized veteran workers and technicians to conduct collective research, master the laws in experiments, and summarize experience. Many engineering technicians and veteran workers spent many days and nights in the workplace to solve complex and unprecedented technical problems. Now, the employees of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant are working with even greater enthusiasm to engage in the trial production of more types of electrified automatic lathes. (Attached picture)

    一一二型自动车床 
    周延祐
    我国制造的第一台自动车床——苏式一一二型单轴纵切自动车床已经由国营南京机床厂试制成功。现在正在继续进行小批试制，明年将成批生产。
    苏式一一二型单轴纵切自动车床是一种新型的工作母机。它可以加工直径十二公厘到五公厘的工作物，可以车外圆、切槽、样板刀切削、铰螺纹、钻孔等，制造精密度较高、形状较复杂的机械零件。它最适合于汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、滚珠轴承厂和仪表工厂的生产需要。
    这种车床的生产效率很高，车头转速每分钟高达七千多转，比普通车床的生产率高八倍。由于零件的全部加工过程都是自动化的，所以在车床调整好以后，技术等级较低的工人也可以操纵，一个技术水平较高的工人可以同时看管五、六台。
    苏式一一二型单轴纵切自动车床是根据苏联的图纸试制的。在试制以前，很多工人和技术人员都没有看见过这种车床，在试制过程中曾遇到了不少困难。如主轴每分钟的最高转速为七千多转，比南京机床厂曾经制造过的最大速度的机床滑动轴承还要高三倍多。如何在高速运转下，使轴承不过热、机床不震动，以保证将来加工的每一个零件的精确，是摆在南京机床厂参加试制的职工面前最困难的课题。领导上发动老工人和技术人员集体研究，在试验中掌握规律，总结经验。许多工程技术人员、老工人，为了解决复杂的、从未碰到过的技术问题，曾在工作场所熬过了许多白天和夜晚。现在，南京机床厂的职工们，正以更高的热情来从事更多种电气化自动车床的试制工作。（附图片）
