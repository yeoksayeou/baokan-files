Indian Public

The Indian public continues to condemn the joint communiqué between the United States and Portugal and expresses great indignation at US Secretary of State Dulles's defense of the joint communiqué at a press conference.

Alvares, chairman of the Goa Congress Party, said in a statement on the 7th that the joint communiqué between Dulles and Cunha "shocked the freedom-loving world." He pointed out that the communiqué completely favored Portugal, and this bias was overwhelming and intentional. "Now, it is clear that the issue is between those who want the colonial world to gain freedom and those who want to perpetuate this evil system."

The "Hindustan Times" wrote on the 8th that Dulles's defense of the joint communiqué was "a shameless support for Portugal's anti-democratic stance and an attempt to link the United States and Portugal in order to maintain colonialism and maintain foreign colonies in this country."

The "National Herald" wrote that if this joint communiqué "correctly represents the attitude of the United States, India knows where the United States stands not only on the issue of colonialism but also on special colonial issues like Goa."

The "Tribune" said that the joint communiqué "shows that the United States is standing up as a huge advocate of colonialism and colonial countries."

The editorial of Bombay's "Free Press" stated that Dulles's remarks "cannot be interpreted as anything other than a deliberate insult to India's position on the Goa issue, a shameless advocacy of colonialism, and support for everything that allows some people to be subordinate to others."

The Bengali newspaper "Ananda Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 5th saying: "The joint statement between Dulles and Cunha is a shameless attempt to hurt and insult the prestige of Asia" and "is essentially a threat to India." The editorial said that the real issue behind the Goa problem is caused by the "Asian policy" of Western countries - especially the United States. They promote this "policy" to achieve their military goals. Therefore, India's task on the Goa issue is no longer limited to driving away the Portuguese; its task has become to eliminate the direct influence of the United States from Goa.

Ceylon Newspapers

The Ceylon press criticized the joint communiqué between the United States and Portugal for calling Goa a "province of Portugal," believing this was "a regrettable example of the shortsightedness of the United States' policy towards Asia."

The "Ceylon Daily News" published an editorial accusing Dulles of insuring the fraudulent rights of the most antiquated and reactionary imperialist country. The newspaper asked, "When Dulles unconditionally supported Salazar's (Portuguese Prime Minister) claim to the so-called 'Portuguese provinces in the Far East,' did he ever think that, according to the same principle, his own country would still be a British colony?"

Representatives of Asian and African Countries to the United Nations

According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on the 5th, the US's position of supporting Portugal's occupation of Goa became a topic of discussion among representatives of Asian and African countries to the United Nations over the past weekend. They talked about the fact that the US-Portuguese communiqué was issued immediately after Soviet leaders made straightforward anti-colonial statements in India. One representative commented coldly: "Now we know who our friends are."

Syrian representative to the United Nations Shukairy told reporters from the Indian Press Trust: "American politicians sometimes say they are anti-colonialist. When Dulles says that Goa is part of Portugal, I don't see how this statement by American politicians can be reconciled with Dulles's attitude towards Goa." He added: The United States "supports colonialism all over the world, which is to regard the whole world as its colony. I think this is the worst kind of colonialism." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 反对美国支持葡萄牙殖民主义者

    反对美国支持葡萄牙殖民主义者
    印度公众
    印度公众继续谴责美国和葡萄牙的联合公报，并且对美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上为这项联合公报辩护一事表示很大的愤慨。
    果阿国大党主席阿尔瓦雷斯在七日发表声明说，杜勒斯和库纳的联合公报“使爱好自由的世界震惊”。他指出，公报完全偏袒葡萄牙，这种偏袒是压倒一切的和有意的。“现在，很明显，问题是那些愿意殖民地世界获得自由的人和那些愿意使这种罪恶制度永远存在下去的人之间的问题。”
    “印度斯坦时报”八日写道：杜勒斯为联合公报所作的辩护是“对葡萄牙反民主立场的恬不知耻的支持，也是想把美国和葡萄牙联系起来以维护殖民主义和维持外国在这个国家的殖民地的一种企图”。
    “国民先驱报”写道，如果这个联合公报“正确地代表美国的态度的话，印度就知道，不仅在殖民主义问题上，而且在像果阿这样的特殊殖民问题上，美国是站在什么立场上”。
    “论坛报”说，这个联合公报“表明美国正在作为一个殖民主义和殖民国家的巨大的拥护者挺身出来”。
    孟买“自由新闻”的社论说，杜勒斯的谈话“是对印度在果阿问题上的立场的故意侮辱，对殖民主义的恬不知耻的拥护，和为一切能够使某些人隶属于其他人的现象继续存在的人提供支持，除此以外，不能有别的解释。”
    孟加拉文日报“欢喜市场报”五日发表社论说：“杜勒斯和库纳的联合声明是想伤害和侮辱亚洲的威信的无耻企图”，并且“基本上是对印度的威胁”。社论说，果阿问题背后的真正的问题是西方国家——特别是美国——的“亚洲政策”造成的。它们推行这一“政策”的目的是为了实现它们的军事目标。因此，印度在果阿问题上的任务，已经不再限于赶走葡萄牙人，它的任务已经变成从果阿排除美国的直接的影响了。
    锡兰报纸
    锡兰报界抨击美国和葡萄牙联合公报把果阿称为“葡萄牙的省份”，认为这是“说明美国对亚洲政策的短视的一个令人遗憾的例子”。
    “锡兰每日新闻”发表社论，指责杜勒斯给一个最陈腐和反动的帝国主义国家的欺诈性权利打保险。报纸问道：“当杜勒斯不问是非地支持萨拉查（葡萄牙总理）对所谓‘葡萄牙在远东的省份’的要求的时候，他有没有想到，根据同样的原则，他自己的国家就会仍然是英国的殖民地呢？”
    亚非国家驻联合国代表
    据印度报业托辣斯五日报道，美国支持葡萄牙强占果阿的立场在上周周末已经成为亚非国家驻联合国代表们议论纷纷的题目。他们谈论到美葡公报是紧接着苏联领导人在印度发表直率的反殖民主义的言论后发表的这一事实。一位代表冷淡地评论道：“现在我们知道谁是我们的朋友了。”
    叙利亚驻联合国代表舒凯里对印度报业托辣斯的记者说：“美国的政治家有时说他们是反殖民主义的。当杜勒斯说果阿是葡萄牙一部分的时候，我看不出美国政治家的这种说法同杜勒斯对果阿所采取的态度，怎么能够是不矛盾的。”他又说：美国“支持世界各处的殖民主义，这就是把整个世界看作它的殖民地。我认为这是一种最坏的殖民主义。”　（据新华社讯）
