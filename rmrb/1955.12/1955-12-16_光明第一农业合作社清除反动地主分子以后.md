    After the Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sujia Township, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, cleared out the escaped reactionary landlord Zhao Zhushi, who had infiltrated the cooperative to carry out sabotage activities, in March of this year, it further checked its past work, dealt with outstanding issues, and improved various systems. The whole cooperative has taken on a completely new look. Members who had previously requested to withdraw from the cooperative now know that the reason why the agricultural cooperative had not been run well in the past was due to Zhao Zhushi's sabotage. Now that the cooperative has eliminated this major scourge, they have confidence in running the agricultural cooperative well and no longer request to withdraw.

    The most obvious change after clearing out the escaped reactionary landlord Zhao Zhushi is that the cooperative is united, especially among the cooperative's cadres, who are as united as one person. In the past, due to Zhao Zhushi's instigation and discord within the cooperative, the cooperative's cadres were suspicious of each other and lacked unity, which affected production. For example, cooperative director Yang Bingyan has always been active in his work, but his work style was sometimes rigid; deputy director Ma Tiansheng also worked hard, but because he was not elected as the director, he felt somewhat dissatisfied. The escaped reactionary landlord Zhao Zhushi took advantage of this loophole and secretly instigated discord between the director and deputy director, telling Ma Tiansheng that Yang Bingyan was elected as the cooperative director because he "lobbied among the members," and suggested that Ma Tiansheng strike against Yang Bingyan. Once, when Yang Bingyan went to the city for a meeting, Ma Tiansheng, influenced by Zhao Zhushi's instigation, relaxed production management, did not arrange production on time, and shirked responsibility when things happened, which caused losses to the agricultural production cooperative's production. During the process of clearing out Zhao Zhushi, all of Zhao Zhushi's conspiracies and tricks were exposed, the misunderstandings between the cadres were resolved, and they each examined their own shortcomings. Now, the four directors and deputy directors have clear divisions of labor. They hold a liaison meeting every day to jointly study and solve various problems that occur in the cooperative. In the past, the cooperative management committee did not hold meetings for a long time; occasionally, when a meeting was held, it often resulted in quarrels and no problems were solved because Zhao Zhushi (who was then a member of the cooperative management committee) instigated discord. Now, meetings are held on time, and problems are effectively solved. For example, the cooperative planted a lot of millet this year. When weeding the millet, there was a shortage of labor. Some members were worried that if the millet could not be weeded on time, there would be a large reduction in yield. Farmers outside the cooperative were also talking about it. In order to overcome this difficulty, cooperative director Yang Bingyan and several deputy directors held a meeting to study and decided to mobilize women in the cooperative to participate in this work. Then, it was discussed in the cooperative management committee. After the meeting, the cooperative cadres quickly mobilized the women, and more than 40 women went to the fields every day, and the millet was weeded in five days.

    After clearing out Zhao Zhushi, the members' enthusiasm for production has increased, especially after the implementation of the "small contracting system," the members are more energetic when doing work. In the past, due to Zhao Zhushi's sabotage, the members' enthusiasm for production was depressed, and there was a lack of management in production. Members did not pay attention to quality when doing work, some "loafed on the job," and some even pretended to be sick and did not go to the fields for production. Now the situation has completely changed. For example, when it comes to hauling manure, members used to harness the carts only after it was bright, and only hauled four or five trips in the morning; now they harness the carts as soon as the rooster crows, and they can haul eight or nine trips in the morning for the same distance. In the past, many members hoed the land very roughly, hoeing once and covering it up once, but now they hoe very carefully and diligently. Yang Peizhu, who used to pretend to be sick and unwilling to go to the fields for production, is now also active. In July of this year, it rained, and a shed in the cooperative collapsed. Yang Peizhu was worried that there would be no place to put the carts if it rained again, so he took the initiative to repair the leaky shed, and found two children in their teens to help him, and the shed was repaired in less than half a day.

    When preparing for autumn sowing, the members remembered the lessons of last year: due to Zhao Zhushi's sabotage, the preparation for autumn sowing last year was not done well, resulting in more than 20% missing seedlings in the more than 400 mu of wheat that was sown. This year, the members paid close attention to the preservation of seeds and seed selection, as well as to harrowing the land and dividing the cultivated areas. The wheat seeds needed by the cooperative this year were carefully selected, of which 13,500 jin were selected by 18 members using a seed selector without sleeping for one night. In September, the Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative harrowed all the reserved wheat fields, removed weeds, and precisely divided the cultivated areas of each team. The agricultural tools used for planting wheat were repaired in advance. All of this had never happened before.

    The Guangming No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative has 70 head of draught animals, all of which are well-fed. In the past, when Zhao Zhushi was in the cooperative, due to his instigation among the cadres, the cooperative's production management was chaotic, the feeders did not feed the livestock well, and they did not take good care of the livestock's use. In one month, nine head of livestock died in succession. After clearing out Zhao Zhushi, the cooperative strengthened the management of draught animals and selected Chang Keqin, Liu Sicai, and Ma Hongtai, members who are responsible and experienced in raising livestock, to serve as feeders. They are very concerned about the livestock's cold, warmth, hunger, fullness, and use. In the past, no one cared when the livestock got sick, and there was often no dry soil in the pen, and the livestock lay in feces and urine; now, as soon as the livestock gets sick, the feeders ask the veterinarian to treat them, and the pen is often filled with dry soil. In the past, a cow gave birth to a calf, and because no one took care of it, the cow crushed a calf to death; now, when the mare is about to foal, the feeder Chang Keqin stayed up for three consecutive nights, carefully taking care of it, so that the foal was born smoothly.

    光明第一农业合作社清除反动地主分子以后
    陈有志
    陕西省咸阳县苏家乡光明第一农业生产合作社在今年三月间清除了混入社内进行破坏活动的漏网反动地主赵柱石以后，对过去的工作又作了进一步的检查，处理了遗留问题，健全了各项制度，全社气象焕然一新。曾经要求退社的社员，知道了过去农业合作社没有办好的原因是由于赵柱石从中破坏，现在社里清除了这一大害，对办好农业合作社都有了信心，不再要求退社了。
    清除漏网反动地主赵柱石以后，最明显的改变是社内团结起来了，特别是社内干部之间，团结得像一个人一样。过去由于赵柱石在社内进行挑拨离间，社干部彼此猜忌，互不团结，影响生产。例如社主任杨秉彦工作一贯积极，但工作方式有时生硬；副主任马天升工作也很努力，但因为自己没被选上当正主任，心里有点不满。漏网反动地主赵柱石钻了这个空子，就暗中挑拨正副主任的关系，向马天升说杨秉彦当选社主任是“在社员中活动了”，给马天升出主意打击杨秉彦。在一次杨秉彦进城开会的时候，马天升受了赵柱石的挑拨，放松了生产管理，不按时安排生产，有事也推诿不管，使农业生产合作社的生产受了损失。在清除赵柱石的过程中，赵柱石的一切阴谋诡计都被揭穿了，干部之间的误会解除了，并各自检查了自己的缺点。现在，四个正副社主任都有明确的分工，他们每天开一次接头会，共同研究解决社内发生的各种问题。过去社管理委员会长期不开会；偶而开一次会，也因为赵柱石从中挑拨（赵柱石当时是社管理委员会委员），时常发生争吵，而且什么问题也解决不了。现在既能按时开会，又能切实解决问题。例如今年社里种了很多谷子，在锄谷子的时候，劳动力不够，有些社员就耽心谷子如果不能按时锄过，就会大量减产。社外农民也议论纷纷。为了克服这个困难，社主任杨秉彦和几个副主任开会研究，确定发动社内妇女参加这一工作。接着又在社管理委员会进行了讨论。会后，社干部很快把妇女发动起来，每天都有四十多名妇女下地，五天的时间就把谷子锄完了。
    清除赵柱石以后，社员的生产情绪提高了，特别是实行了“小包工制”办法以后，社员做起活来更加有劲。过去由于赵柱石的破坏，社员生产情绪消沉，生产又缺乏管理，社员做起活来不注意质量，有的“磨洋工”，有人甚至装病不下地生产。现在情况完全改变了。譬如拉粪这件事情，过去社员总是在天大明以后才套车，一晌只拉四、五趟；现在鸡一叫就套车，同样远的地，一晌可以拉八、九趟。过去许多社员锄地锄得很粗糙，锄一锄、盖一锄，现在锄得很细致认真。过去装病不愿下地生产的杨培珠，现在也积极起来了。今年七月间下雨，社里一间车房塌了，杨培珠耽心再下雨没处放车，他就主动修理这间漏房，找了两个十多岁的孩子给他帮忙，不到半天时间就把车房修好了。
    在进行秋播准备工作的时候，社员们都记取了去年的教训：由于赵柱石的破坏，去年秋播准备工作没做好，致使种下的四百多亩麦子缺苗百分之二十以上。今年在保管种子和选种方面，在打耱地和划分耕作区方面，社员们都很注意。今年社里需要的麦种都经过细心挑选，其中有一万三千五百斤，是十八个社员一晚没有睡觉用选种机选出来的。九月间，光明第一农业生产合作社就把预留麦地全部打耱好了，除去了杂草，各组的耕作区也进行了精确的划分。种麦用的农具，事先都进行了修理。这一切，都是过去所没有过的。
    光明第一农业生产合作社有七十头耕畜，都喂得很肥。过去赵柱石在社里的时候，由于他在干部之间进行挑拨，社内生产管理混乱，饲养员不好好喂牲口，对牲口的使用也不爱护，有一个月，牲口曾接连死去九头。清除赵柱石以后，社内加强了对耕畜的管理，选择了工作负责、对饲养牲畜有经验的社员常克勤、刘四财和马宏太担任饲养员的工作。他们对耕畜的寒暖饥饱和使用都非常关心。过去牲口有了病没人管，圈里经常没有干土，牲口卧在粪尿里；现在牲口一有病，饲养员就请兽医治疗，圈里经常堆满干土。过去有一头母牛下犊，因为没有人照管，大牛把一头小牛压死了；现在饲养员常克勤在母马将要下驹的时候，他连续三夜没有睡觉，留心照管，使马驹顺利降生下来。
