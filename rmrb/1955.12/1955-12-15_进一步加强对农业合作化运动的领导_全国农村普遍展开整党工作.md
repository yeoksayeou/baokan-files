    Xinhua News Agency, December 14th. Recently, Chinese Communist Party grassroots organizations in rural areas across the country have universally launched rectification work of varying scales in conjunction with the agricultural cooperative movement. The rectification work of CCP branches in rural areas of Hubei and Zhejiang provinces, among others, started earlier and has now come to an end.

    When CCP branches in rural areas conducted rectification, they primarily used the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation and Chairman Mao's report on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation as the main content of education. They also combined this with the local agricultural cooperation situation, focusing on examining the attitude of party members towards the agricultural cooperation movement, the leadership role of the branch in the agricultural cooperation movement, and the branch and party members' implementation of the Party's various policies. CCP branches in various places have adopted various methods to carry out rectification work according to local conditions: some used the branch as a unit, using party lessons or branch meetings; others used the district or county as a unit, using methods such as concentrating all party members for study and training. Some CCP county and district committees also trained and organized a large number of work teams (groups) to go deep into the countryside to help rural branches with relatively weak work capabilities carry out rectification.

    After the rectification, the leadership ability of CCP branches in rural areas and the socialist consciousness of Communist Party members have significantly improved. During the rectification, various places also eliminated some counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, and other bad elements who had infiltrated the Party. These achievements have powerfully promoted the agricultural cooperative movement in various places. After the rectification of two thousand eight hundred and thirty-five CCP branches in twenty-three counties in the eastern and central Guangdong administrative regions of Guangdong Province, two thousand three hundred and eighty branches were able to actively lead the agricultural cooperative movement. Among the fifty-nine counties of Nehe, Keshan, and Fujin in Heilongjiang Province, most of the more than five hundred and thirty CCP branches with relatively weak work capabilities that had undergone rectification have improved to the working level of general branches and are able to lead the agricultural cooperative movement. After the Fengdu Township Party Branch in Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, underwent rectification, it actively led farmers to conduct agricultural cooperation planning for the entire township, promoting a upsurge in the cooperative movement throughout the township. In two months, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the township increased from the original three to twenty-six, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives reached 54% of the total number of farmers in the township. After Jiang Bidi, a Communist Party member from Yutou Town, Changle County, Fujian Province, profoundly criticized his past fear of hardship and non-active leadership in running cooperatives during the party rectification, he actively led the farmers in the mutual aid group he participated in to establish an agricultural production cooperative. Because of his active work, he was elected by the farmers as the director of the cooperative. Lin Mingxi, the director of the Lintang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tong'an County, realized his past mistake of excluding poor peasants during the party rectification, and in the recent stage alone, he has absorbed sixteen poor households to join the agricultural production cooperative he leads. After the party members of Muzhai Township in Xingyang County, Henan Province, received party rectification education, their class consciousness and political vigilance were greatly improved, and they quickly eliminated sixteen landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries from the township's agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, which further consolidated the township's cooperatives and groups.

    进一步加强对农业合作化运动的领导
    全国农村普遍展开整党工作
    新华社十四日讯　全国各地农村中的中国共产党基层组织，最近普遍结合农业合作化运动开展了规模不同的整顿工作。湖北、浙江等省农村中的中共支部的整顿工作开展得比较早，现在已经告一段落。
    各地农村中的中共支部进行整顿的时候，都是以党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告为主要的教育内容，结合着本乡农业合作化的情况，着重检查了党员对农业合作化运动的态度、支部对农业合作化运动的领导作用以及支部和党员执行党的各项政策的情况。各地中共支部都根据当地的情况，采取了各种不同的方法来进行整顿工作：有的是以支部为单位，用上党课或开支部大会等方式来进行；有的是以区或县为单位，用集中全体党员进行学习、训练的方式来进行。有些地区的中共县委、区委还训练和组织了大批的工作队（组）深入农村，帮助工作能力比较弱的农村支部进行整顿。
    经过整顿以后，各地农村中的中共支部的领导能力和共产党员的社会主义觉悟都有了显著的提高。在整顿中，各地还清除了一些混进党内的反革命分子、阶级异己分子和其他坏分子。这些成就，有力地推动了各地的农业合作化运动。广东省粤东和粤中行政区二十三个县的两千八百三十五个中共支部经过整顿以后，有两千三百八十个支部都能够积极领导农业合作化运动。黑龙江省讷河、克山、富锦等五十九个县中经过整顿的五百三十多个原来工作能力比较弱的中共支部，大部分都已经提高到一般支部的工作水平，能够领导农业合作化运动。贵州省兴义县丰都乡党支部经过整顿以后，积极领导农民进行全乡的农业合作化规划工作，推动全乡掀起了一个合作化运动的热潮，两个月中，全乡的农业生产合作社就由原来的三个发展到二十六个，入社农户达到全乡农户总数的百分之五十四。福建省长乐县屿头镇共产党员蒋鼻俤在整党中深刻地批判了自己过去怕艰苦、不积极领导办社的错误思想以后，就积极地领导他参加的那个互助组的农民，建立了一个农业生产合作社。由于他工作积极，被农民选为社长。同安县莲塘乡农业生产合作社社长林明习在整党中认识了自己过去排斥贫农的错误，仅在最近一个阶段，就吸收了十六户贫农加入他领导的农业生产合作社。河南省荥阳县穆寨乡的党员经过整党教育以后，阶级觉悟和政治警惕性大大提高，很快就从全乡的农业生产合作社和互助组中，清除了十六名地主、富农和反革命分子，使全乡的社和组进一步得到了巩固。
