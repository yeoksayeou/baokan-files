Youth from sixteen provinces and cities across the country have formed volunteer land reclamation teams.

Under the slogans "March towards the Wasteland" and "March towards Difficulties," a wave of organizing youth volunteer reclamation teams to develop wasteland has swept across the country.

Since the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team set off on August 30th, sixteen provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Hunan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, as well as some county-level cities, have organized the first groups of youth volunteer reclamation teams. Now, tens of thousands of young volunteer reclaimers are engaged in development work on vast wastelands ranging from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island and the banks of the Nu River in the south.

The youth volunteer reclamation teams that departed earlier in various places have already obtained their first fruits of labor on the wasteland. Due to insufficient livestock, excessive autumn rain, and other reasons, the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team revised its original plan to reclaim 2,000 mu of wasteland. They have now reclaimed 1,200 mu of wasteland, harvested 240,000 catties of grass, and built 15 dormitories and 8 stables on the new land. With the help of the state tractor team, the Liaoning Youth Volunteer Reclamation Corps has reclaimed 890 hectares of wasteland in the past two months. They have encountered many difficulties on the wasteland. However, with the continuous encouragement of the Party and the people, they have overcome various difficulties, and through labor practice, have gone from not understanding technology to learning technology, and from hesitation to firm determination.

In order to meet the needs of the country and satisfy the youth's desire to develop the wasteland, youth league organizations at all levels are now treating mobilizing youth to participate in land reclamation and build the frontier as an important task of the league organization. Under the leadership of the Party committee, many provincial and municipal youth leagues have cooperated with various departments to formulate plans for organizing youth for long-distance and short-distance land reclamation in the future. The Fujian Provincial Youth League Committee has already formulated a plan for organizing youth land reclamation teams to pilot the construction of youth collective farms, and has conducted surveys of wasteland. The Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial Youth League Committees have designated dedicated personnel to regularly manage land reclamation work. The Jilin Provincial Youth League Committee recently made a resolution on youth participating in land reclamation, aiming to mobilize 100,000 urban and rural youth to reclaim 50,000 hectares of wasteland in the next two years. The Heilongjiang Provincial Youth League Committee plans to convene a provincial conference of youth land reclamation activists next spring to commend advanced individuals, exchange advanced experiences, and further promote the upsurge of youth land reclamation.

    全国有十六个省市青年组成志愿垦荒队
    全国广大青年在“向荒地进军”、“向困难进军”的口号下，已经形成了组织志愿垦荒队去开拓荒地的热潮。
    自北京市青年志愿垦荒队在八月三十日出发垦荒以来，全国已经有辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、河北、山东、上海、武汉、天津、湖南、广东、浙江、福建、河南、云南、江西、广西十六个省、市及部分县城组织了首批青年志愿垦荒队。现在，上万的青年志愿垦荒者，正在北起黑龙江、南至海南岛和怒江边的辽阔的荒原上从事开拓工作。
    各地出发较早的青年志愿垦荒队，已经在荒地上获得了第一批劳动果实。北京市青年志愿垦荒队由于畜力不足，秋雨过多和其他原因，修改了原定的开荒两千亩的计划，现在已经开出荒地一千二百亩，打草二十四万斤，在新地上盖好十五间宿舍和八间马棚。辽宁省青年志愿垦荒团在国家拖拉机队帮助下，两个月来已经开出八百九十公顷荒地。他们在荒地上遇到的困难是很多的。但在党和人民不断鼓励下，他们克服了各种困难，通过劳动实践，由不懂技术到学会技术，由犹豫到坚定下来。
    青年团各级组织为了适应国家的需要和满足青年们开拓荒原的愿望，现在也都把动员青年参加开荒、建设边疆当成团组织的一项重要工作，不少省、市团委，在党委领导下，协同各部门进行了今后组织青年远距离和近距离垦荒的规划。青年团福建省委已经作出了关于组织青年垦荒队，试建青年集体农庄的方案，并且进行了荒地的勘察工作。青年团黑龙江和吉林省委已经指定专人经常管理垦荒工作，青年团吉林省委在最近并且作出关于青年参加开垦荒地的决议，要在明后两年内动员十万城乡青年开垦五万公顷荒地。青年团黑龙江省委准备在明年春天召开全省青年垦荒积极分子大会，表彰先进人物，交流先进经验，进一步推进青年垦荒的热潮。（新华社）
