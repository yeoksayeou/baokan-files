    Industrial Furnace Thermal Engineering Work Science Discussion Held in Shenyang
    From the 10th to the 13th, two hundred professors, experts, and engineers held a scientific discussion in Shenyang on improving industrial furnace thermal engineering work, studying how to increase the productivity of industrial furnaces, and reducing fuel consumption.

    Scientists presented and discussed twenty-four research reports at the meeting, including "Rational Use and Effective Utilization of Northeast Coal," "Graphical Method for Combustion Calculation Based on Industrial Analysis," and "Experiences Related to Thermal Operation of Small Open-hearth Furnaces." They shared experiences in industrial furnace thermal engineering work and scientific research over the past few years. Soviet expert Nazarov, who was lecturing at the Northeast Institute of Technology, also gave a report to the scientific workers on the basic principles of furnace design.

    After discussion, the professors and technicians further understood the importance of industrial furnace thermal engineering science and technology for the development of heavy industry and had a clear understanding of the direction of future scientific research. They believe that industrial furnace thermal technology is a relatively weak link in our country's current production, and in order to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan, industrial furnace thermal engineering scientific workers must solve a series of key problems in industrial furnace thermal engineering work.

    Participants in this discussion included teachers from Northeast Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Kunming Institute of Technology, Chongqing University, and Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, as well as engineers from relevant factories and mines.

    工业炉热工工作科学讨论会在沈阳举行
    十日到十三日，二百个教授、专家和工程师等人在沈阳举行关于改善工业炉热工工作，研究提高工业炉生产率和减少燃料消耗的科学讨论会。
    科学家们在会上提出了“东北煤的合理使用及有效利用”、“由工业分析进行燃烧计算的图解法”和“有关小型平炉热工操作经验”等二十四个研究报告，并且作了讨论。他们在会上交流了几年来工业炉热工工作和科学研究的经验。在东北工学院讲学的苏联专家那扎洛夫还给科学工作者报告了炉子设计的基本原则。
    教授和技术人员们经过讨论以后，进一步了解了工业炉热工科学技术对发展重工业的重要性，并且对今后进行科学研究的方向有了明确的认识。他们认为工业炉热工技术是我国当前生产上较薄弱的一个环节，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，工业炉热工科学工作者必须解决一系列工业炉热工工作上的关键问题。
    参加这次讨论会的包括东北工学院、北京钢铁工业学院、昆明工学院、重庆大学和中南矿冶学院的教师和有关厂矿的工程师。
