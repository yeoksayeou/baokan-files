Shanxi Province recently convened a province-wide conference of representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). More than 280 people attended, including representatives of TCM and specially invited representatives of Western medicine. The conference called on TCM and Western medicine practitioners to unite and cooperate, study and organize the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and serve socialist construction.

The attending representatives engaged in criticism and self-criticism, and criticized erroneous viewpoints such as "TCM has no future" and "TCM and Western medicine should develop in a balanced way and compete for survival." Many representatives expressed their determination to actively serve the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperativization. They also expressed their determination to study Marxism-Leninism diligently, overcome conservative thinking and sectarianism, and learn modern medical science, especially advanced Soviet medical experience. On the basis of raising ideological awareness and strengthening unity, the representatives exchanged experiences through discussions and enthusiastically contributed their decades of clinical experience and family secret prescriptions. There were more than 1,700 various effective and secret prescriptions, and 13 handwritten copies of clinical experience accumulated over the years. Among them were experiences in treating hemorrhoids and fistulas, folk remedies for treating otitis media, and experiences in treating tetanus.

At the conclusion of the conference, Wang Zhongqing, director of the Cultural and Educational Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee, on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee, put forward the following specific measures for vigorously developing TCM work in the future: (1) Western and TCM medicine should be unified in planning and comprehensively arranged; health institutions in factories, mines, schools, groups, and government agencies should absorb TCM practitioners to participate in the work; establish TCM research institutions; develop TCM joint clinics and joint Western and TCM clinics; unify the medical and preventive work of practicing doctors; and doctors who are half-farmers and half-doctors should actively participate in agricultural production cooperatives. (2) Strengthen the management and operation of Chinese herbal medicine. (3) Continuously improve the political and theoretical level, scientific and cultural level, medical theory and technical level of TCM practitioners; expand the TCM continuing education school into a TCM school, and adopt the method of specialized rotational training to improve existing TCM practitioners, and use the method of apprenticeship to cultivate TCM talents.

According to the initiation and proposal of the representatives, the Shanxi Provincial TCM Research Association was established to facilitate unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, mutual learning and encouragement, timely exchange of experience, and research and organization of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.
