Strengthening Communist Moral Education for the Working People
Zhong Peizhang

Our country is in a period of transition from capitalism to socialism. A great and profoundly significant socialist revolution is underway in all aspects of our country. This revolution must not only eliminate all exploiting classes and systems of exploitation, and complete the socialist transformation of the entire national economy, but also conduct communist education for the working class and complete the re-education and transformation of the petty bourgeoisie. Stalin once profoundly pointed out: "This historical era is necessary not only to create those economic and cultural prerequisites that guarantee the complete victory of socialism, but also to enable the proletariat to: first, educate and train itself into a force capable of managing the state; second, re-educate and transform the petty-bourgeois stratum according to the direction that guarantees the organization of socialist production." ("Problems of Leninism," p. 55) Leading the masses of the people to complete the socialist transformation of the entire national economy and educating the masses of the people in the spirit of communism are the Party's dual tasks in the transition period.

The Chinese Communist Party has always attached importance to the communist education of the masses of the people. Since liberation, the Party has carried out large-scale education and transformation work among the masses of the people throughout the country. Many foreign delegations who come to visit China, in addition to seeing the rapid economic development and the enormous scale of construction in our country, are often surprised by the tremendous changes in the spiritual outlook of the masses of the people; in particular, the vibrant young generation in our country has made a deep impression on them. This change in the spiritual outlook of the masses of the people is the result of our Party's efforts over the past few years. We regard this change as an increase in our country's spiritual wealth. And this increase in spiritual wealth, like the increase in material wealth, is of equal importance to the construction of our country.

Why does our Party attach so much importance to the communist education of the masses of the people? We know that the socialist revolution marks the end of the preliminary history of mankind and the beginning of the true history of mankind. This means that the spontaneous process of society has been replaced by the conscious activities of the working masses. Unlike the spontaneous formation of production relations in past historical stages, socialist production relations are not formed spontaneously within the old society, but are formed after the victory of the revolution, under the leadership of the Party and the state, based on the objective laws that have been recognized, through conscious and planned activities of the working masses. In the old society, the working masses were forced to engage in various kinds of labor under the lash of the whip. In the new society, we must rely on the workers' consciousness to carry out construction. In our country, the initiative for social transformation from top to bottom by the Party and the state is combined with the broad initiative of the working masses from bottom to top. Lenin once pointed out: "Such a builder of society can only be many millions of people. In the era of serfdom, only hundreds of people built the country; in the era of capitalism, only thousands or tens of thousands of people built the country; now, the socialist transformation can only succeed if millions of people actively, directly, and practically participate in the management of the country." Therefore, the level of communist consciousness and communist morality of the broad masses of the working people is bound to be related to the speed of socialist construction and the strength of our country.

However, the development of consciousness lags behind the changes in the material conditions of social life. And the change in moral concepts is the slowest change in the consciousness of the masses. Before the victory of the revolution, although communist morality had already begun to form among the advanced elements of the working class, it was ultimately only possessed by a few advanced elements. For thousands of years, the vast majority of our people have lived under a system of private property. Under this system, individual interests and social interests are often in conflict. The common principle upon which this system is based is: either you plunder others, or others plunder you; either you work for others, or others work for you. This has formed the deep-rooted psychology, habits, and views of people that "man dies for wealth, bird dies for food," and only caring about oneself regardless of others, as well as the individualism, egoism, ethnic disputes, greed, stinginess, insidiousness, hatred of humanity, and other abominable psychological characteristics that arise from this. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, although the situation has undergone fundamental changes under our new social system, these old psychologies, habits, views, and various prejudices continue to influence the masses of the people. Stalin once said that these old habits and customs, traditions and prejudices, are the most dangerous enemies of socialism, and they can sometimes pose a great danger to our revolutionary regime. It should be particularly pointed out that, for the current situation in our country, this old ideology is not merely a question of remnants, but also has a considerable class foundation. There are still bourgeoisie and rich peasants in our country, and they are spreading the influence of bourgeois ideology and bourgeois lifestyles in various ways at all times. The petty bourgeoisie, which surrounds us like a vast ocean, is also constantly producing and growing capitalism before it is transformed. At the same time, under the circumstances of capitalist encirclement and sharp and complex struggles against the enemy, various capitalist ideas that have invaded from abroad will have a direct or indirect impact on some people in our society. Therefore, the bourgeois moral outlook and lifestyle have a broad market. It will inevitably affect the revolutionary ranks. The shocking examples of entire Party or Youth League organizations being corrupted and degenerating in some places are still fresh in our memory. And if we are not vigilant, it is still possible for this to happen in the future.

This cannot but require our Party to tirelessly strengthen the communist education of the working people, overcome the old private psychology and habits, and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology. Because communist ideas and communist morality will not form spontaneously, but can only be the result of the Party's ideological education work. If the Party does not occupy the ideological front of the masses with communist ideology, then capitalist ideology will "spontaneously" occupy this front. Some of our comrades only pay attention to production or business, and ignore political work, and even say "production is politics," because they have not realized this point. They also do not realize that without the communist consciousness of the working people, there can be no victory for socialism. The result of this abandonment of the Party's political leadership and political work is often to bring great harm to our socialist construction cause. In the current great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the Party has instructed to strengthen political work and cultural education work, raise the socialist awareness of the cooperative members, and instructed to closely combine the work of building and consolidating cooperatives with the work of building the Party and the Youth League and consolidating the Party and the Youth League in the countryside. This is very important. Stalin said: "The collective farm, like the Soviets, is a weapon, and only a weapon. Under certain conditions, this weapon can be used against the revolution. This weapon can be used against the counter-revolution. It can serve the workers and peasants. Under certain conditions, it can serve the enemies of the workers and peasants. The whole question is in whose hands this weapon is held, and against whom this weapon is used." ("Problems of Leninism," p. 540) In order to ensure that cooperatives serve the workers and peasants and fight against the enemies of the workers and peasants, the Party must strengthen its political leadership over cooperatives and continuously improve the communist consciousness and moral standards of cooperative members.

Of course, the great significance of communist education goes far beyond this. Once advanced ideas are grasped by the consciousness of millions of people, they become a practical force for creation and transformation, which can promote and accelerate the process of social development and help solve mature historical tasks. Communist ideas and morals cultivated by communist education have a great positive effect on the development of the new society. Countless facts since liberation have proved this. We only need to think about the tremendous impetus that the patriotic ideas that have grown and developed since the founding of the People's Republic of China have had on our various tasks to understand. This patriotic moral force was most prominently demonstrated in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Under the inspiration of lofty patriotism and internationalism, the people of the whole country, on the one hand, defeated the U.S. aggressors in Korea together with the Korean People's Army, and on the other hand, completed the great task of restoring the national economy at home, which surprised the whole world. Similarly, without the new conscious labor attitude of the working class, it would be difficult for us to imagine today's vigorous socialist construction and labor emulation.

The two tasks of building a socialist society and carrying out communist moral education are closely linked. Lenin once said that workers can only transform themselves in the long struggle and practical activities of building communism. Marxist-Leninist theory is the ideological foundation of communist morality. We must arm the working people with Marxist-Leninist theory to improve their communist consciousness. But communist morality cannot be cultivated by preaching. The main way for the Party to educate the working people is to constantly cultivate and improve the communist moral standards of the working people in the practice of striving for the victory of the socialist revolution, and in the struggle to overcome the various difficulties of the new society construction. Therefore, the labor competitions being carried out in factories, the vigorous cooperative movement in rural areas, and the reclamation, scrap metal collection, reduction of cotton and grain losses, and afforestation and tree planting movements initiated by the Communist Youth League are the most vivid methods of carrying out communist moral education. The National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of the Youth held not long ago not only powerfully encouraged the youth to participate in various struggles to build socialism, but also vividly promoted the moral outlook that young people in the new China should have with the heroic deeds of these activists.

Another important aspect of the Party's communist moral education for workers is to constantly struggle against the influence of bourgeois ideas and lifestyles. This is a long-term task that must be carried out to the end even after the elimination of classes. The Communist Youth League organization, as the Party's assistant, also bears a particularly important responsibility in this regard. From October 1954 to the end of July 1955, under the leadership of the Party committees, the Communist Youth League organizations carried out the work of "cultivating young people's communist morality and resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology" in 135 large and medium-sized cities across the country, and achieved good results. Facts have proved that doing so is absolutely necessary. Some young people said: "Without moral education, everyone would go to socialism, but I would go to prison." They wrote to their parents and said: "You should thank the Communist Party, it has given you a good son." Many young people reflected that this education was a "wake-up call" and a "vaccination" for themselves. It should be pointed out that such work cannot be completed by doing it once, but should be carried out regularly. The Communist Youth League organization should become the most courageous shock force in attacking corruption, degeneration, and embezzlement.

In the process of cultivating the communist morality of the working people, the Party's leadership always plays a decisive role. Before the victory of the revolution, the Communist Party members, as the vanguard of the working class, educated the people with their infinite loyalty to the people, high degree of discipline and organization, and lofty qualities such as not avoiding difficulties and not fearing sacrifice. In the current struggle to build socialism, Communist Party members should also become models for the working people to abide by the communist moral code. Therefore, resolutely struggling against bourgeois ideas within the Party and improving the communist moral standards of Party members are of particular importance. The consistency of political prestige and moral prestige is precisely the reason why our Party has become an invincible force.

    加强对劳动人民的共产主义道德教育
    钟沛璋
    我国正处在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。一个伟大而极其深刻的社会主义革命，正在我国的各个方面进行着。这个革命既要消灭一切剥削阶级和剥削制度，完成对整个国民经济的社会主义改造，同时又要对工人阶级进行共产主义教育，并完成对小资产阶级的重新教育和改造。斯大林曾经深刻地指出：“这一个历史时代之所以必要，不仅是为要创造那些保证社会主义完全胜利的经济上和文化上的前提，并且是为要使无产阶级能够：第一，把自己教育并锻炼成为能够管理国家的力量；第二，按照那个保证组织社会主义生产的方向来重新教育并改造小资产阶层。”（“列宁主义问题”，五十五页）领导人民群众完成整个国民经济的社会主义改造和以共产主义精神教育人民群众，这是党在过渡时期中的双重任务。
    中国共产党向来重视对人民群众的共产主义教育。解放几年来，党在全国范围内，在人民群众中进行了规模巨大的教育工作和改造工作。许多前来中国参观的外国代表团，除了看到我国经济发展的迅速和建设规模的巨大外，人民群众精神面貌的巨大变化也往往引起了他们的惊讶；特别是我国生气勃勃的年轻一代，给了他们深刻的印象。人民群众精神面貌的这种变化，就是我们党几年来所努力的结果。我们把这种变化看成是我国精神财富的增长。而这种精神财富的增长，和物质财富增长一样，对我国的建设具有同样重要的意义。
    为什么我们的党这样重视对人民群众的共产主义教育呢？我们知道，社会主义革命，标志着人类前期历史的结束和人类真正历史的开始。这就是说，社会的自发过程已为劳动群众的自觉活动所代替。同过去历史阶段中生产关系的自发形成不一样，社会主义的生产关系不是在旧社会内部自发形成的，而是在革命胜利之后，劳动群众在党和国家的领导下，根据已被认识的客观规律，通过自觉的、有计划的活动而形成的。在旧社会中，劳动群众是被棍棒逼着去从事种种的劳动。在新社会中，则要依靠劳动者的自觉去进行建设。在我们的国家里，党和国家自上而下地对社会改造的发起，是同劳动群众自下而上的广泛的首创精神结合在一起的。列宁曾经指出：“这种社会的建设者只能是许多百万的大众。在农奴时代这种建设者只有几百人，在资本主义时代只有成千成万人来建设国家，现在社会主义的变革，只有千百万人士积极地、直接地、实际地参加管理国家才能成功。”因此，广大劳动人民共产主义觉悟程度和共产主义道德水平的高低，就不能不关系到社会主义建设速度的快慢和我们国家威力的盛衰。
    但是，意识的发展却落后于社会物资生活条件的改变。而道德观念的变革，又是群众意识中变革得最为迟缓的。革命胜利以前，共产主义道德虽然已经在工人阶级先进分子中间开始形成了，但是这终究还只是为少数先进分子所有。几千年来，我们广大人民都是生活在私有财产制度下面。在这种制度下，个人利益和社会利益经常处在对立的地位。这种制度所依据的共同原则是：不是你去掠夺别人，便是别人来掠夺你；不是你替别人做工，就是别人替你做工。这样就形成了人们根深蒂固的“人不为己，天诛地灭”、只关心自己而不顾别人的心理、习惯和观点，以及由此而产生的个人主义、利己主义、民族纠纷、贪婪、吝啬、阴险、仇视人类等等可恶的心理特性。中国人民革命胜利后，在我们新的社会制度下，虽然情况已经有了根本的改变，但是这种旧的心理、习惯、观点以及种种偏见，继续在人民群众中发生影响。斯大林曾经说，这种旧的习惯和风尚、传统和偏见，是社会主义最危险的敌人，它有时会对我们革命政权造成极大的危险。应当特别指出，对于我国目前的情况来说，这种旧的思想意识，还不仅仅是什么残余的问题，而且还有着相当强大的阶级基础。我国目前还存在着资产阶级和富农，他们通过各种方式无时无刻不在散布资产阶级思想和资产阶级生活方式的影响。像汪洋大海一样包围着我们的小资产阶级，在他们未经改造以前，也无时无刻不在产生和滋长着资本主义。同时，在资本主义包围和对敌斗争十分尖锐复杂的形势下，从国外侵入的各种资本主义思想，还会在我们社会中的一部分人中间发生直接或间接的影响。因此，资产阶级的道德观和生活方式，有着广大的市场。它还必然影响到革命队伍。有的地方整个党组织或团组织被腐蚀而变质，这种怵目惊心的例子，是我们记忆犹新的。而且如果我们不加警惕，今后还是有可能发生的。
    这就不能不要求我们党不倦地去加强对劳动人民的共产主义教育，克服旧的私有心理和习惯，来抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。因为共产主义思想和共产主义道德，是不会自发地形成的，而只能是党的思想教育工作的结果。如果不是党以共产主义思想去占领群众的思想阵地，那末倒是资本主义思想会“自发地”去占领这个阵地。我们有些同志只注意生产或业务，而忽视政治工作，并且还说什么“生产即政治”，就是因为他们没有认识到这点。他们也没有认识到，没有劳动人民共产主义的自觉，就不可能有社会主义的胜利。这种放弃党的政治领导和政治工作的结果，往往是给我们的社会主义建设事业带来巨大的危害。在目前农业生产合作社的大发展中，党指示要加强政治工作和文化教育工作，提高社员的社会主义觉悟，并且指示要把建社整社工作同乡村中的建党建团和整党整团工作紧密地相结合。这是非常重要的。斯大林说：“集体农庄这个组织形式，也如苏维埃一样，乃是一个武器，而且仅仅是一个武器。在某种条件下，这个武器是可以用来反对革命的。这个武器是可以用来反对反革命的。它能服务于工农。在某种条件下，它能服务于工农敌人。全部问题是在于这个武器究竟握在谁手中，这个武器究竟是被利用去反对谁。”（“列宁主义问题”，第五四○页）为要保证合作社服务于工农，并去反对工农的敌人，党必须加强对合作社的政治领导，不断提高社员的共产主义觉悟和道德水平。
    当然，共产主义教育的重大意义，还远不止于此。先进的思想一掌握了千百万人的意识，就变成一支创造的和改造的实际力量，它能促进并加速社会发展的进程，帮助解决已经成熟的历史任务。由共产主义教育而培养起来的共产主义思想和道德，对新社会的发展，有着伟大的积极作用。解放以来的无数事实，都证明着这一点。只要我们想一想，从中华人民共和国成立而生长发展起来的爱国主义思想，对我们各项工作所起的巨大推动作用，就可以明白。这种爱国主义的道德力量，在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，表现得最为突出。全国人民在崇高的爱国主义和国际主义思想鼓舞下，一方面在朝鲜和朝鲜人民军一起击败美国侵略者，另一方面在国内完成了恢复国民经济的巨大任务，使全世界都感到惊奇。同样的，如果没有工人阶级新的自觉的劳动态度，我们就很难想像会有今天蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义建设和劳动竞赛。
    建设社会主义社会和进行共产主义道德教育两个任务是密切结合的。列宁曾经说过，工人只有在建立共产主义的长期斗争及实践活动中才能改造自己。马克思列宁主义理论是共产主义道德的思想基础，我们必须以马克思列宁主义理论去武装劳动人民，以提高他们的共产主义自觉性。但是共产主义道德是不可能用说教的办法来培养的。党教育劳动人民的主要途径，是在争取社会主义革命胜利的阶级斗争的实践中，在克服新社会建设的各种困难的斗争中，不断地培养和提高劳动人民的共产主义道德水平。因此，工厂中开展着的劳动竞赛，农村中蓬蓬勃勃的合作化运动，青年团组织发起的开荒、拣废钢铁、减少棉粮损耗、植树造林等等运动，就是进行共产主义道德教育的最生动的方法。不久以前召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，不仅是有力地鼓舞了青年去参加建设社会主义的各项斗争，而且还以这些积极分子的种种英勇事迹，生动地宣扬了新中国青年应有的道德面貌。
    党对劳动者进行共产主义道德教育的另一个重要方面，就是不断地同资产阶级思想和生活方式的影响进行斗争。这是直到阶级消灭之后还必须进行到底的长期的任务。作为党的助手的青年团组织，在这方面也担负着特别重要的责任。从一九五四年十月起，到一九五五年七月底止，青年团组织在党委领导下，在全国一百三十五个大、中城市中，开展了“培养青年共产主义道德、抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀”的工作，获得了良好的成绩。事实证明，这样做是完全必要的。有的青年说：“不是道德教育，大家都到了社会主义，我却进了监狱。”他们写信给自己的父母说：“你们应该感谢共产党，它使你们有了好儿子。”许多青年反映，这次教育是给自己“敲了警钟”，“打防疫针”。应该指出，这样的工作不是做一次就能完成，而应经常地进行。青年团组织应该成为在向腐化、堕落、贪污等坏风气进攻中的一支最勇敢的突击力量。
    在培养劳动人民共产主义道德的过程中，党的领导永远起着决定的作用。在革命胜利以前，作为工人阶级先锋队的共产党员们，就以自己对人民的无限忠诚、高度的纪律性和组织性、不避艰难、不怕牺牲等崇高的品质教育了人民。在目前建设社会主义的斗争中，共产党员也应该成为劳动人民遵守共产主义道德准则的模范。因此，坚决同党内的资产阶级思想作斗争，提高党员的共产主义道德水平，就具有特别重要的意义。政治威信和道德威信的一致，正是我们党所以成为不可战胜的力量的原因。
