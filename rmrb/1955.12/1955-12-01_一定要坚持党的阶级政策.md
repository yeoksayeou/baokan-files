    We Must Adhere to the Party's Class Policy
    Mao Qi

    The Xingfu (Happiness) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tigou Village, Qiandong District, Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, was established in December of last year. During the cooperative ranking in the spring of this year, it was ranked as a second-class cooperative, but it collapsed in less than half a year. After Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on the "Question of Agricultural Cooperation" were transmitted to Liquan County, this cooperative was restored. However, soon after its restoration, many problems occurred one after another in the cooperative. What is the reason for this?

    It turned out that when this cooperative was first established, the Party branch and the cooperative establishment staff did not implement the Party's class policy, and did not firmly rely on the poor peasants. On the contrary, they wanted to rely on six upper-middle peasant households, calling them "key households."

    Tigou Village has a total of eighty-nine households. Apart from the six so-called "key households" of upper-middle peasants, most are poor and lower-middle peasants. The village has a total of eight large carts, and these few households occupy four and a half of them; their livestock are strong, and their farm tools are complete, truly "strong people and horses"! The Party branch committee members and the cooperative establishment staff were envious and said: With these six households, why worry about not running the cooperative well! In a Party group meeting before the establishment of the cooperative, many people believed that to run the cooperative well in Tigou Village, it was necessary to break through these "key households." So they started to work on these six households. First, they absorbed two upper-middle peasants with "prestige," Zhao Liankai and Lei Shengmin, as members of the cooperative establishment committee. After the registration began, the cooperative establishment staff proposed that the establishment committee members should set an example and take the lead in registering. As a result, Zhao Liankai and Lei Shengmin's households were "tied up." At that time, when the poor peasants in the village heard about registering to establish a cooperative, more than forty households registered at once. In principle, wouldn't more than forty households be enough to establish a cooperative? The cooperative establishment staff saw that the four upper-middle peasant households had not registered, so they asked the whole village to continue registering. After registering again and again, the four upper-middle peasant households still did not budge. The staff then assigned village cadres to persuade these households, but the result was still ineffective. Helpless, the cooperative establishment staff had to personally "visit," and after much persuasion, the four upper-middle peasant households reluctantly registered to join the cooperative.

    After the six upper-middle peasant households joined the cooperative, the cooperative establishment staff felt relieved and justified, and some comrades even naively said: This will benefit the poor peasants! The opposite was true. Before long, these "key households" were called "wavering households" by the masses. When the cooperative was just established and production materials were being evaluated, Zhao Liankai's large cart was evaluated at the highest price, but he still said it was undervalued; the livestock of upper-middle peasants Zhao Tingshi and Zhao Yongxin were evaluated according to the market price, but they were still not satisfied.

    When sowing cotton, the cooperative determined that each household should provide cotton seeds; but Zhao Liankai's son refused to provide them, saying: "Cotton seeds should also be distributed fairly according to the ratio of four parts to land and six parts to labor." When the cooperative was carrying out spring weeding, Zhao Liankai again raised the issue of summer miscellaneous grains (broad beans, peas) not being included in the cooperative. Naturally, the poor peasant members could not agree to these unreasonable demands, so Zhao Liankai and others openly clamored to withdraw from the cooperative. During the summer harvest, when Zhao Tingshi saw that his horse had been fattened by the cooperative and had also been mated, he pretended to be crazy and asked the cooperative director to withdraw from the cooperative and return the horse. Lei Shengmin also secretly colluded with Zhao Liankai and others, preparing to raise opinions on the distribution ratio. The distribution ratio determined by this cooperative was four parts to land and six parts to labor. In principle, there was not much wrong with this ratio, but these upper-middle peasant households were very dissatisfied. They said: "The nearby cooperatives are all half for land and half for labor, but we are four parts to land and six parts to labor. This is to divide the land of the middle peasants!" They secretly rejoiced at the unreasonable system determined by the cooperative: "All the scattered sideline income from driving carts and building walls outside should belong to the cooperative."

    As soon as the summer harvest ended, the problem broke out. Lei Shengmin and Zhao Huaiding, the upper-middle peasants who served as feeders, both proposed not to feed the livestock. Then they instigated some vaguely aware members to pull their cattle out of the cooperative. But twelve poor and lower-middle peasant households insisted on continuing to run the cooperative. Poor peasant Zhao Lianzhou said: "Even with these twelve households, we will run an iron cooperative!" Zhao Lianzhou and others also raised this issue with the Party branch. But when the district committee heard that several upper-middle peasant households were going to withdraw from the cooperative, they panicked and complained that the higher authorities should not have allowed them to develop such a large cooperative, which was not easy to consolidate. Lei Sixian (a Communist Party member), the director of the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative, twice asked the district committee for support in running the cooperative, but the comrades of the district committee flatly refused this request. The cooperative thus "collapsed."

    In late August, after Chairman Mao's instructions were issued, the Qiandong District Committee did not seriously understand the spirit of the instructions, and hastily went to Tigou Village to rectify and restore the cooperative. When the poor and lower-middle peasants heard that the collapsed cooperative was going to be restored, they were naturally overjoyed and rushed to register. The situation of the upper-middle peasants was obviously different. Lei Shengmin and Zhao Tingshi initially expressed their unwillingness to join the cooperative again, and Zhao Yongshan proposed: "If you want me to join the cooperative, I have to keep my horse."... But Xie Dengjia, the district committee secretary who came to restore the cooperative, did not learn from the lessons of establishing the cooperative, and still did not use the method of class analysis to observe and deal with the problem. After the rectification work began, he still did not pay attention to implementing the Party's class policy and did not rely on the poor peasants; on the contrary, he wanted to use the method of accommodating the middle peasants, such as changing the distribution ratio of four parts to land and six parts to labor to half for land and half for labor, to forcibly pull several upper-middle peasant households back into the cooperative. As a result, several upper-middle peasant households remained indifferent. At this time, the district committee secretary's compulsory order came, he said: "This time we have 'the central instructions,' where do you want to run if you don't join the cooperative?" Seeing that the situation was not right, several upper-middle peasant households had to register to join the cooperative. Thus, a cooperative of dozens of households "arose again in a rush."

    After Zhao Liankai and others were pulled back into the cooperative again, they were still uneasy; but this time they did not openly clamor to withdraw from the cooperative, but adopted another clever method. As soon as the cooperative was restored, they proposed to divide the cooperative. Originally, Tigou Village had two major surnames, Zhao and Lei. Except for Lei Shengmin's household, all six upper-middle peasant households were surnamed Zhao, and most of the Lei family were poor peasants. Zhao Liankai's son proposed to separate from the Lei family on one hand, and on the other hand, he used the past estrangement between the Lei and Zhao families to instigate some poor peasants surnamed Zhao to propose the separation of the cooperative. They also found many excuses, saying: "When the cooperative is small, the hearts are aligned!" "When the cooperative is small, it is easy to lead!" The district staff blindly agreed to this request, and the cooperative was divided. But the six upper-middle peasant households were not satisfied. Their "intention was not to get drunk on the wine." Their purpose was to collapse the cooperative again, so they continued to carry out activities. In the Lei family, Lei Shengmin, an upper-middle peasant in the former Lei family, used some small disputes among the members to separate most of the later Lei family, who were mostly poor peasants. In the Zhao family, those upper-middle peasants were also finding excuses to separate from the nineteen poor peasant households west of the well (there is a well in the middle of the village). The poor peasant members were so angry that they said: "Why don't you propose to divide the cooperative into seventy-two stalls!" The matter did not end there. Zhao Liankai and others continued to make trouble. After the cooperative was restored, it began to engage in sideline production in conjunction with agricultural production. Seeing that the sideline production in the cooperative was in full swing, they fantasized and proposed: "Land shares should be divided into sideline dividends." When the poor peasant members refuted this unreasonable demand, Zhao Liankai unreasonably prevented the members from using livestock, saying: "Agricultural livestock cannot be used for sideline production." Later, it even got to the point where every work in the cooperative could not be carried out smoothly. Originally, the cooperative determined that whoever cut alfalfa would have it recorded in their account, but when it was executed, Zhao Liankai stubbornly held the horse and asked the cooperative for cash. There was no public feeding room in the cooperative yet, and several livestock were tied to the trough of upper-middle peasant Zhao Huaiding. Zhao Huaiding found many reasons to have the livestock pulled away. The cooperative had just decided to buy a double-wheeled double-share plow, and Zhao Yongfeng, the son of upper-middle peasant Zhao Chongyu, spread rumors among the members, saying: "The cattle are too small to pull it." This caused some members to have opinions on the cooperative, making it impossible for the cooperative director Zhao Chongjin to lead.

    Regarding the issue of the composition of the members, Chairman Mao has given us clear instructions in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." He said: "I think that in the current year or two, in all cooperatives that are still in the early stages of promotion or have not been promoted for long, that is, in most areas at present, it should be: (1) poor peasants; (2) lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants; (3) lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants—let the activists among these people be organized first." The cadres of Qiandong District just didn't follow this instruction. When establishing and rectifying the cooperative in Tigou Village, they didn't rely on the poor peasants, but repeatedly and repeatedly forced the upper-middle peasants to join the cooperative, making this cooperative precarious, collapsing in a rush and rising again in a rush. This is a serious lesson that everyone should deeply remember.

    一定要坚持党的阶级政策
    毛锜
    陕西省醴泉县阡东区提戈村幸福农业生产合作社，是去年十二月建立的。在今年春天全区合作社排队的时候，这个合作社排为第二类，可是不到半年的工夫它就垮了台。毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”的指示传达到醴泉县以后，这个合作社又重新恢复起来了。但是刚刚恢复起来，社里又接二连三地发生了许多毛病，这究竟是什么原因呢？
    原来这个合作社在最初建立的时候，党支部和建社工作人员就没有贯彻执行党的阶级政策，没有坚定地依靠贫农，相反的倒是想依靠六户上中农，把他们称做“关键户”。
    提戈村，共八十九户，除了六户所谓“关键户”的上中农外，大都是贫农和下中农。全村共有八辆大车，这几户就占了四辆半；他们的牲口硬，农具全，真是“人强马壮”！党支部委员和建社工作人员看得眼热了，都说：有这六户，何愁社办不好！在建社前的一次党的小组会上，不少人也都认为：要在提戈村把社办好，非突破这些“关键户”不可。于是他们就开始向这六户做工作。首先，就将两个有“威信”的上中农赵连凯和雷生民吸收为建社委员会委员。报名开始以后，建社工作人员就提出：建社委员应该以身作则，带头报名。这样一来，赵连凯和雷生民两户就被“拴住”了。当时，全村的贫农一听说报名建社，一次就有四十多户报名。按理说四十多户不是很可以建立一个合作社了吗？建社工作人员一看那四户上中农没有报名，就让全村继续报名。报来报去四户上中农还是不啃气。工作人员就分配村干部包干去说服这些户，结果仍然无效。没办法，建社工作人员只得亲自“登门拜访”，三说两说，工作人员的“盛意难却”，四户上中农只好勉勉强强报名入社。
    六户上中农入社后，建社工作人员如释重负，心安理得，甚至还有个别同志天真地说：这可为贫农谋下利益了！事实恰恰相反，没有多久，这些“关键户”，就被群众称为“动摇户”了。社刚建成、评议生产资料的时候，赵连凯的大车评了最高的价格，但他还说评得低了；上中农赵廷士和赵永信的牲口是按照集上估价评的，可是他们仍是不满意。
    播种棉花的时候，社里确定各户都要出棉籽；但赵连凯的儿子硬是不出，说：“棉花籽也应该按地四劳六出才公平。”社里进行春锄，赵连凯又提出了夏杂粮（扁豆、豌豆）不入社的问题。这些不合理的要求，贫农社员自然不能答应，于是赵连凯等就公开闹着要退社。夏收的时候，赵廷士看见社里把他的马喂肥了，也配上驹了，他就装疯卖傻，整天找社主任要求退社退马。雷生民也暗地里串通赵连凯等，准备提出关于分配比例的意见。这个社确定的分配比例为地四劳六，按说这个比例并无多大毛病，可是，这几户上中农却大为不满，他们说：“附近的合作社都是地劳各半，偏偏咱们是地四劳六，这是想分中农的地呢！”他们对社里确定的不合理的制度：“出外推车、打墙等一些零星副业收入要全部归社”，却暗地里幸灾乐祸。
    夏收刚刚结束，问题就爆发了，担任饲养员的上中农雷生民和赵怀定都提出不喂牲口了。接着他们就煽动了一部分认识模糊的社员拉牛退社。但是有十二户贫农和下中农坚持要把社办下去，贫农赵连周说：“就是咱们这十二户，也要办他个铁社！”赵连周等还向党支部提出了这个问题。但是区委一听到几户上中农要退社，就惊惶失措起来，埋怨上级不该让他们发展这么大的社，弄得不好巩固。幸福农业生产合作社主任雷思贤（共产党员）两次到区委会要求支持办社，区委的同志却干干脆脆地拒绝了这一请求。合作社就这样“一哄而散”。
    八月下旬，毛主席的指示下达以后，阡东区委没有认真地领会指示的精神，就草率地到提戈村去作整顿和恢复合作社的工作了。贫农、下中农听说要把垮了的社恢复起来，当然一个个兴高采烈，争先报名。上中农的情形显然不同了，雷生民和赵廷士一开始就表示不愿意再入社，赵永善提出：“要叫我入社，我得把马留下。”……但是来做恢复合作社工作的区委书记谢登甲丝毫没有接受建社的教训，仍然不用阶级分析的方法去观察问题、处理问题。整社工作开始后，他仍然不注意贯彻执行党的阶级政策，不依靠贫农；相反地，他倒想用迁就中农的办法，如将地四劳六的分配比例，改为地劳各半分红，来硬拉几户上中农回社。结果几户上中农仍然表示冷淡。这时候，区委书记的强迫命令就来了，他说：“这次有了‘中央的指示’，你们不入社还想跑到哪里去？”几户上中农一看势头不对，都不得不报名入社。于是一个几十户的合作社又“一哄再起”。
    赵连凯等人再次被拉进社以后，仍然是皇皇不定；不过这次他们不公开闹退社，而是采取了另一种巧妙的方法。社刚一恢复，他们就提出来要分社。原来提戈村有赵家和雷家两大姓，六户上中农除过雷生民一户外，全是姓赵，而雷家大部分是贫农。赵连凯的儿子一面自己提出来要和雷家分社，一面还利用过去雷赵两家有隔阂，煽动了一些赵姓贫农跟着提出分社。他们还找了许多借口，说什么：“社小了，心齐呀！”“社小了，便于领导呀！”区工作人员盲目地答应了这一要求，社分开了。但是六户上中农并不满意，他们是“醉翁之意不在酒”，目的是想把社再次搞垮，就继续进行活动。在雷家，前雷家的上中农雷生民，就利用社员之间一些小纠纷，要把绝大部分都是贫农的后雷家分开。在赵家，那些上中农也在找借口，要和井（村当中有一井）西边的十九户贫农分社。气得贫农社员说：“你们为啥不提出把社分成七十二摊呢！”事情并不到此结束，赵连凯等还在一再节外生枝。合作社恢复以后，就结合着农业生产开始搞副业生产，他们看到社里副业搞得热火，就异想天开地提出：“地股应该分副业的红”。贫农社员把这种不合理的要求驳倒，赵连凯又无理地阻挠社员使用牲口，说什么：“搞副业不能使用农业的牲口”。后来，甚至弄得社里每样工作都不能顺利开展，原来社里确定割谁的苜蓿给谁记账，但是执行的时候，赵连凯硬是勒住马找社里要现钱。社里还没有公共饲养室，有几个牲口在上中农赵怀定的槽上拴着，赵怀定就寻了许多理由，让把牲口拉走。社里刚决定买一架双轮双铧犁，上中农赵崇玉的儿子赵永峰，就在社员中散布谣言，说：“牛小根本拉不起”。惹得一些社员对社有意见，弄得社主任赵崇金没法领导。
    关于社员的成份问题，毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”报告中，已给我们作了明确的指示，他说：“我以为在目前一两年内，在一切合作社还在开始推广或者推广不久的地区，即目前的大多数地区，应当是：（1）贫农；（2）新中农中间的下中农；（3）老中农中间的下中农——这几部分人中间的积极分子，让他们首先组织起来。”阡东区的干部偏偏不遵守这一指示，在提戈村建社、整社不依靠贫农，却一而再，再而三地强拉着上中农入社，使得这个合作社飘摇不定，一哄而散，一哄再起。这是一个严重的教训，大家都应该深深记取。
