Under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau convened a city-wide medical and preventative work conference in September, focusing on the elimination of medical malpractice. After the meeting, the vast majority of medical units in the city widely launched studies on eliminating medical malpractice. During the two-month study period, staff from various medical units in the city examined their work with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, analyzed the causes of medical malpractice, and criticized the seriously irresponsible medical practices of some staff members. Through this study, they generally improved their ideological understanding, and their work also improved accordingly.

First, the handling of critically ill patients has greatly improved. For example, at the Chongqing No. 3 Workers' Hospital, due to the irresponsibility of a doctor, a child suffering from "type B" encephalitis died en route to the infectious disease hospital this summer. After the study, they accepted the lessons of this incident. On October 26th, when they received a child suffering from equally critical acute enteritis, they actively rescued the child and saved his life. The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the No. 5 People's Hospital organized a rescue team to specialize in rescuing critically ill patients. On a holiday, four pregnant women arrived, including two cases of dystocia and one cesarean section. Thanks to the rescue team's intense work from early morning until 12 o'clock at night, all four pregnant women and their babies safely overcame the difficulties. When the No. 3 People's Hospital performed arterial blood transfusions to rescue a patient with massive bleeding from a stomach ulcer, many doctors, seeing the patient's critical condition, voluntarily participated in the rescue work even during their vacations, working continuously from 4:30 PM until after 6:00 AM the next morning, improving the patient's condition. Young comrades at the Maternity Hospital also organized a blood transfusion team. Some doctors in outpatient departments no longer simply refuse to deal with critically ill patients. They not only actively rescue them, but also personally escort them to the hospital. Some people even bring oxygen cylinders when escorting patients and help them with hospitalization procedures.

After the study, some hospitals have also made some improvements in their work systems. For example, the No. 2 People's Hospital used to mechanically implement the emergency regulations, only looking at body temperature regardless of other conditions. Now, the emergency regulations have been revised to facilitate patients. The No. 1 Workers' Hospital has strengthened the nursing system for seriously ill patients to ensure patient safety and timely detection of problems. In addition, units such as the No. 3, 4, and 9 People's Hospitals and the No. 2 Workers' Hospital have strengthened the system of requesting instructions and reporting. When encountering critically ill patients that the hospital cannot solve or when major problems occur, they can immediately request instructions and report to higher authorities.

The study has also strengthened the connection and cooperation between hospitals, between departments within hospitals, and among comrades.

    重庆卫生工作人员积极消灭医疗事故
    重庆市卫生局在中共重庆市委和市人民委员会的领导下，曾于九月间召开了以讨论消灭医疗责任事故为中心内容的城市医疗预防工作会议。会后市所属绝大多数医疗单位普遍开展了消灭医疗责任事故的学习。在两个多月的学习中，市属各医疗单位的工作人员，用批评和自我批评的精神检查了自己的工作，分析了发生医疗责任事故的原因，批判了某些工作人员严重不负责任的医疗作风。他们经过学习，在思想认识上普遍有所提高，工作也随着有了改进。
    首先是处理危急病人的工作有了很大改进。如重庆市第三工人医院，由于医生不负责任，今夏使一个患“乙型”脑炎的病孩，在转往传染病医院的途中死亡。经过学习后，接受了这一事件的教训，在十月二十六日接受一个同样危急的急性肠炎的病孩时，即积极抢救，挽救了小孩的生命。第五人民医院妇产科组织了抢救小组，专门抢救危急病人。在一个例假日，来了四个产妇，其中有两个难产，一个剖腹产，由于抢救小组的人员从一早紧张地工作到晚上十二点钟，使四个产妇和婴儿都平安地度过了难关。第三人民医院对一胃溃疡大出血病人施行动脉输血抢救时，许多医生见病人情况危急，虽在休假期间，都自动参加了抢救工作，从下午四时半开始一直工作到次晨六时多，使病人情况好转。产科医院青年同志也组织了输血小组。有些门诊部的医生遇到危重病人，也不再是一推了事，他们不但积极抢救，而且亲自护送病人到医院，有的人在护送病人时还带上了氧气筒，并帮助病人办理住院等手续。
    经过学习，有些医院在工作制度上也有了若干改进。如第二人民医院从前机械地执行急诊条例，只看体温不管其他情况，现在修订了急诊条例，方便了病人。第一工人医院加强了重病的护理制度，以保证病人的安全和能够及时发现问题。此外，第三、四、九等人民医院和第二工人医院等单位，加强了请示报告制度，遇有危重病人本院不能解决或发生较重大问题时都能立即向上级请示报告。
    经过学习也加强了医院和医院之间、医院内部科和科之间以及同志们互相之间的联系和合作。
