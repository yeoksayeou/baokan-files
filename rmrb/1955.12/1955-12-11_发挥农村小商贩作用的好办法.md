Good Ways to Bring the Role of Rural Small Traders into Play
    Mou Lan

    With the development of the agricultural cooperative movement on a national scale, the production and living materials needed by farmers will inevitably increase greatly. To do a good job in supplying the rural market, in addition to state-owned and cooperative commerce strengthening their supply and purchase business, it is also necessary to adjust the existing commercial network and make rational and full use of rural small traders and peddlers. The practice of the 18th District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, in properly arranging and transforming rural small traders and peddlers on the basis of the existing commercial network is a good way.

    In the work of adjusting the commercial network and arranging for the transformation of private merchants, the 18th District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Jiaoxian County carefully investigated the purchasing power of the masses this year and their needs for commodities, and based on the investigation materials, calculated the purchasing and sales tasks that the public and private commerce in the district actually needed to bear. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative also investigated the distribution of existing private merchants and peddlers and private merchants who had closed down last year but may resume business, and studied from the distribution of private merchants what kind of organizational form to use to transform them and the extent to which they could be organized. It specifically analyzed the distribution of the existing state-owned, cooperative, and private commercial networks and the existing problems. Then, on the basis of the existing commercial network, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning, gradual adjustment," it prepared a plan for setting up and adjusting the commercial network, and after it was approved by the county Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it steadily carried out the adjustment. This approach of adjusting the commercial network according to the current local situation is able to meet the actual needs. In particular, taking the commercial network of the district Supply and Marketing Cooperative as the core, based on the specific conditions of the distribution of private merchants and peddlers, business conditions, and whether they can maintain their reasonable income, etc., under the principle of voluntariness, appropriate adjustments are made in three aspects: business area, commodity variety, and transformation form. In this way, rural private merchants and peddlers can be fully utilized to carry out material exchanges and give play to their strengths of being able to endure hardship and hard work, going deep into remote rural areas, and participating in short-distance transportation. This practice can not only properly arrange rural small merchants and peddlers and invigorate the rural market, but also more rationally adjust the commercial network, facilitating the masses to sell and buy. Many farmers in the 18th District of Jiaoxian County can now buy daily necessities without leaving their villages. In the areas designated for supply by purchasing and sales agents, they can be seen delivering goods every two or three days. Many small local products and waste products are purchased through them, which can save farmers' time for purchasing and sales. Many people have reflected: "This year, it is easier to sell and more convenient to buy." At the same time, after preliminary transformation, small merchants and peddlers can generally compile business plans to order goods on a quarterly or monthly basis. In particular, cooperative stores generally establish statistical, accounting, and planned report systems. Through plans and reports, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative can timely grasp the changes in the business situation of private merchants, and incorporate the plans of small merchants and peddlers into the track of commodity circulation plans, which can also facilitate the management and transformation of them by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

    Adjusting the commercial network is an extremely meticulous and complex task, and all localities must conduct this work based on their specific local conditions.

    发挥农村小商贩作用的好办法
    牟澜
    随着农业合作化运动在全国范围内展开，农民需要的生产和生活资料必然会大大增加。要做好农村市场的供应工作，除了国营和合作社商业要加强供应和收购业务外，还必须调整现有的商业网，合理地充分地利用农村小商小贩。山东省胶县十八区供销合作社在现有商业网的基础上，妥善地安排和改造农村小商贩的做法是一个好的办法。
    胶县十八区供销合作社在进行调整商业网和安排改造私商工作中，比较细致地调查了今年群众的购买力和他们对商品需要的情况，并且依据调查材料，计算出本区公私商业实际需要负担的购销任务；供销合作社又调查了现有私商小贩和去年歇业而又可能复业私商的分布状况，从私商分布的状况方面来研究采用何种组织形式来对他们进行改造，以及他们可能组织起来的程度。具体地分析了现有国营、合作社、私营商业网的分布状况和存在的问题，然后在现有商业网的基础上，按照“统盘规划、逐步调整”的方针，编制了设置和调整商业网的计划，再经过县供销合作社批准后，稳步地进行了调整。这种根据目前当地具体情况来调整商业网的作法，是能够切合实际需要的。特别是以区供销合作社的商业网为核心，根据私商小贩分布的情况、经营条件、能不能维持他们的合理收入等具体情况，在自愿的原则下，从经营地区范围、商品品种、改造形式等三方面来进行适当的调整，这样可以充分利用农村私商小贩开展物资交流，发挥他们能够吃苦耐劳、深入偏僻农村、参加短距离贩运的长处。这种做法，既能适当安排农村小商小贩，又能够活跃农村市场，还可以比较合理地调整商业网，便利群众出售和购买。胶县十八区的许多农民，现在不出村就能够买到日用必需品，在划定代购代销员供应的地区里，每隔两三天就可以看到他们来送货。许多小土产品和废品，都通过他们收购去，能够节省农民购销的时间。许多群众都反映：“今年是卖的省事、买的方便”。同时，小商小贩在经过初步改造后，一般都能按季按月编造业务计划要货。特别是合作商店一般都建立了统计、会计、计划报表等制度。通过计划和报表等，供销合作社就可以及时掌握私商经营情况的变化，并使小商小贩的计划纳入商品流转计划的轨道，还可以便利供销合作社对他们的管理和改造。
    调整商业网是个极为细致而复杂的工作，各地在进行这一工作时，还必须根据当地的具体情况来进行。
