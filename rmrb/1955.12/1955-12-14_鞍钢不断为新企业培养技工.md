　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company will have another 286 skilled workers mastering 34 technologies graduating this December and returning to their factories and mines. This is the fifth group of workers that Anshan Iron and Steel has trained for brother factories since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. Over the past three years, Anshan Iron and Steel has trained 1,752 workers for Daye, Changchun, Harbin and other places in new technologies and automated operations such as steel rolling and instrumentation.

　　When training technicians for new enterprises, many factories of Anshan Iron and Steel came up with various methods to fully guarantee their practical operation. Some factories also held technical training classes for apprentices from new enterprises, with technicians and veteran workers teaching technical theory to supplement the shortcomings of the master-apprentice contract. Before returning to their new posts, many of the newly trained workers also assisted Anshan Iron and Steel in training new apprentices.

    鞍钢不断为新企业培养技工
    今年十二月份又将有二百八十六名掌握三十四种技术的熟练工人在鞍山钢铁公司学成以后回到自己的厂矿去。这是鞍钢从第一个五年计划开始以来，为兄弟工厂培养出来的第五批工人。三年来，鞍钢先后曾为大冶、长春、哈尔滨等地培养了轧钢、仪表等新技术和自动化操作的工人一千七百五十二名。
    鞍钢的许多工厂在为新企业培养技工时，想出各种办法，充分地保证了他们的实习操作。有的工厂还为新企业的徒工举办技术训练班，由技术员、老工人讲授技术理论，以辅助师徒合同的不足。许多培养起来的新工人在回到新的岗位以前，还协助鞍山钢铁公司培养了新的徒工。
