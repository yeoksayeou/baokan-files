Comrade Premier, Comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Comrades! Friends!

　　Today, in our capital – Beijing, we are holding a grand gathering to welcome the esteemed friend of the Chinese people, the brave fighter of the German people for the peaceful, democratic, and unified fatherland, the outstanding German statesman, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Comrade Grotewohl, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, who have come to visit our country. With boundless pleasure, I represent all the citizens of Beijing to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to Comrade Premier and all the comrades of the delegation.

　　A year ago, our Premier Zhou Enlai visited the German Democratic Republic, and the premiers of China and Germany issued a joint communiqué, affirming our two countries' common desire to develop friendly cooperation and safeguard world peace. This friendly visit by the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic will further strengthen the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, further enhance the strength of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and greatly benefit peace in Europe, Asia, and the world.

　　Comrades, the German nation is a great nation. Germany is the homeland of the founders of scientific socialism, our great teachers of the international proletariat revolution, Marx and Engels. We especially thank the German nation because this nation produced the great Marxism, making unparalleled contributions to all mankind. The reason why the Chinese revolution has been able to achieve today's great victory is entirely due to the Chinese Communist Party, under the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism, which is the achievement of Marxism-Leninism. We thank Marx, we thank the German nation. The German nation has also produced famous scientists, writers, and artists, such as Goethe, Schiller, Heine, and Beethoven, who have made significant contributions to human culture. At the same time, the achievements of the German people in modern science and technology are also world-renowned. These are also worthy of our respect and gratitude. Today, we should also especially thank the German people for their significant contributions to world peace. As everyone knows, in the past, Germany was the hotbed of two world wars, and now the imperialists are still planning to make Germany a hotbed of new wars. However, the existence and development of the German Democratic Republic have seriously undermined the imperialists' sinister plan to revive German militarism and create new wars. This matter is an even greater contribution of the German Democratic Republic to the cause of world peace, and also a major assistance to the Chinese people fighting for peace.

　　The German Democratic Republic is the heir and defender of the glorious history and fine traditions of the German people. The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic has achieved great successes, and it has become a strong fortress of German peace, democracy, and unity forces and an important factor in safeguarding European security and world peace.

　　According to the Potsdam Agreement, Germany should become a peaceful, democratic, and unified country. The 600 million Chinese people fully support all the efforts made by the German people to achieve this goal. We oppose the various attempts by the aggressive forces headed by the United States to consistently obstruct the smooth realization of this national aspiration of the German people. Recently, the international aggressive forces have again unreasonably rejected the correct proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on establishing a European collective security system and establishing an All-German Committee, attempting to drag the entire Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, making Germany once again a hotbed of new wars. This conspiracy of imperialism is contrary to the will of the German and all peace-loving people in the world, and the inevitability of historical development dictates that it will inevitably fail. The German people's struggle for the peaceful, democratic, and unified fatherland represents the interests of all the German people and the trend of historical development. It is a just cause, and it will surely triumph.

　　In recent years, China and Germany have conducted comprehensive cooperation in politics, economy, and culture. Here, we should first point out the great support given to our country by the German Democratic Republic. The assistance and support of the German Democratic Republic to our country has accelerated the development speed of our country's socialist construction and encouraged the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory, Taiwan. Therefore, taking this opportunity, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the people of Beijing to Comrade Premier, all comrades of the delegation, and through you, to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

　　Comrade Premier, we Chinese people will always be the faithful friends of the German people and the German Democratic Republic. The German people will continue to receive the full support of the 600 million Chinese people in their struggle for the unification of their fatherland. Please, Comrade Premier, convey the sincere friendship of our Chinese people to the German people.

　　Comrades, friends, let's shout:
    Long live the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German people!

    在北京各界欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团大会上
    彭真市长的讲话尊敬的总理同志，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的同志们，同志们！朋友们！
    　今天在我们的首都——北京举行盛大的集会，欢迎中国人民敬爱的朋友、德国人民争取祖国和平、民主、统一的英勇的战士、德国杰出的政治家、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志前来我国访问，我以无限愉快的心情，代表北京市全体市民，向总理同志和代表团全体同志们，表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    一年以前，我国总理周恩来同志曾访问了德意志民主共和国，中德两国总理发表了会谈公报，肯定了我们两国发展友好合作和维护世界和平的共同愿望。这次，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的友好访问，将进一步加强中华人民共和国同德意志民主共和国的友谊，进一步增强以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量，并且大大有益于欧洲、亚洲和世界的和平。
    同志们，德意志民族是一个伟大的民族。德国是科学社会主义的创始人、我们伟大的国际无产阶级革命的导师马克思和恩格斯的故乡。我们特别感谢德意志民族，因为这个民族产生了伟大的马克思主义，给全人类做出了无比的贡献。中国革命所以能够得到今天的巨大胜利，完全是中国共产党在毛泽东同志的正确领导下，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义所做出的功绩，这是马克思列宁主义的功绩。我们感谢马克思，感谢德意志民族。德意志民族还产生了像歌德、席勒、海涅、贝多芬等对人类文化有过重大贡献的著名的科学家、文学家和艺术家。同时，德意志人民在近代科学技术上的成就，也是举世闻名的。这些也都是值得我们表示尊敬和感谢的。我们今天还应该特别感谢德意志人民对于世界和平所做的重大贡献。大家知道，在过去的年代中，德国曾经是两次世界大战的温床，现在帝国主义者还在打算使德国成为新战争的温床。然而德意志民主共和国的存在和发展却严重地打击了帝国主义者复活德国军国主义制造新战争的罪恶计划。这件事，更是德意志民主共和国对于全世界和平事业的重大贡献，也是对于为和平而斗争的中国人民的重大援助。
    德意志民主共和国是德意志人民光荣历史和优良传统的继承者和捍卫者。德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设已获得了巨大成就，它已成为德国和平、民主、统一力量的坚强堡垒和保卫欧洲安全和世界和平的重要因素。
    按照波茨坦协定，德国应该成为和平、民主和统一的国家，六万万的中国人民完全支持德国人民为实现这个目的所进行的一切努力。我们反对以美国为首的侵略势力一贯阻挠德国人民顺利实现这个民族愿望的各种企图。最近国际侵略势力又无理地拒绝苏联和德意志民主共和国关于建立欧洲集体安全体系和成立全德委员会的正确主张，妄图把整个德国拖进侵略性的北大西洋公约，使德国再次成为新战争的温床。帝国主义这种阴谋是违反德国和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的意志的，历史发展的必然性注定了他是一定会失败的。德国人民争取祖国和平民主统一的斗争是代表着全德人民的利益和历史发展的趋势的，它是正义的事业，它一定会胜利。
    几年以来，中德两国在政治、经济、文化各方面进行了全面的合作。在这里我们应该首先指出德意志民主共和国给我国的巨大支援。德意志民主共和国对我国的帮助和支持，加速了我国的社会主义建设的发展速度，鼓舞了中国人民解放自己领土台湾的斗争。因此，趁这个机会我代表北京市人民特别向总理同志，代表团全体同志，并通过你们向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示衷心的谢意。
    总理同志，我们中国人民将永远是德国人民和德意志民主共和国的忠实朋友，德国人民在争取自己祖国统一的斗争中将继续得到六万万中国人民的全力支持。请总理同志将我们中国人民的真诚友谊转达给德意志人民。
    同志们，朋友们，让我们高呼：
    中德两国人民友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
