Heilongjiang is Beckoning
By our staff reporter Fang Qing

In Heilongjiang Province, located in the northeastern corner of our motherland, a grand project of ever-increasing scale is underway: the reclamation of vast, fertile wilderness.

Anyone who has visited Heilongjiang Province cannot help but praise its rich land. Indeed, the land of Heilongjiang is enchanting. The soil here is meadow chernozem, leached chernozem, or sod-podzolic soil, rich in humus. Because this soil contains abundant humus and has a moderate pH, it is naturally suitable for the growth of most plants. The soil structure is loose, allowing rainwater to penetrate and be stored. During dry periods, moisture is transported to the plants through capillary action. In other words, this soil is both drought-resistant and flood-resistant. According to estimates by the Provincial Land Survey Bureau, the province has six million hectares of reclaimable wasteland.

The relatively cold climate of the Heilongjiang region, with temperatures reaching "forty degrees below zero," is a major concern for many. However, such extreme cold only occurs in a few places and for short periods, thanks to the natural barriers of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, which block the Siberian cold currents. Take Luobei County, which is close to the Heilongjiang River, for example. The lowest recorded temperature in its history was on one day in 1953, when it dropped to minus 37 degrees Celsius. According to records, the average annual temperature for the province is between zero and four degrees Celsius. In particular, the temperature is very high during the crop-growing season, with an average temperature of 23.2 degrees Celsius in Jiamusi in July. The shortest frost-free period is 120 days, and the longest is 160 days. The annual rainfall is 400 to 600 millimeters. Such natural conditions are very suitable for the growth of wheat, corn, sorghum, soybeans, millet, and rice. Moreover, Qiqihar and Suiling County are located above 47 degrees north latitude, and apple cultivation has been successful there. These areas have been enjoying locally grown apples for three years.

When you think of opening up wasteland in the Northeast, you may think of the "Going to Guandong" of older generations. Indeed, in the old society, many people from Shandong came to Heilongjiang. They had only a carrying pole, two baskets, one end carrying simple luggage and cooking utensils, and the other end carrying their children. Their wives followed behind, leaning on sticks, enduring hunger and hardship, to reach the Great Northern Wilderness. They had no vehicles or horses, so they had to clear land for the landlords. The landlords, in turn, bought the wasteland from "wasteland brokers." These "wasteland brokers" had a group of people who specialized in "horseback land grabbing," selling it to the landlords as "wasteland deeds." After passing through layers of hands, each taking their cut, the people who cleared the land inevitably ended up "landless, barnless, and with tattered clothes," still facing hunger and cold... But this is not that era anymore. Now, when clearing wasteland, you will not only not be exploited or extorted by anyone, but you can also receive travel expenses subsidized by the state. Upon arrival, you will have warm houses and heated brick beds, and you will be exempt from agricultural taxes for three years...

The state is making various preparations for reclaiming wasteland. Currently, the Land Survey Bureau is concentrating a thousand surveyors, working separately in the Muling River, Luobei, and western Heilongjiang Province, and surveying small patches of wasteland in fifty-four counties. They often go to places where no one else has been before, and they frequently change their lodging every day. Small shrubs scratch their hands, leaving them covered in scars, and tear their clothes to shreds. Sometimes, when walking through grass taller than a person, they have to tie themselves together with ropes to avoid losing contact. During the rainy season, they often wrap their office supplies and rations in raincoats, carrying them wherever they go... Wang Zhenyan, a student at the Northeast Institute of Geology, wrote to his friend, "We want to turn this place into a land of fish and rice, just like the Dongting Lake area, to become the granary of our motherland."

All of this is to formulate a huge land reclamation plan. It is estimated that these six million hectares of wasteland will be reclaimed during the Second and Third Five-Year Plans. It has now been determined to establish and expand six large state-owned farms. In 1956, state-owned farms will reclaim approximately 100,000 hectares, equivalent to the total area reclaimed by state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province in the past eight years. Eight tractor reclamation stations will also be established, with ninety tractor reclamation teams under them, which will eventually develop into agricultural machinery stations. In addition, local farmers will be actively mobilized to reclaim wasteland, and youth reclamation teams and immigrants from within the passes will be organized to come here to reclaim land and settle down. In 1956, Heilongjiang Province plans to receive 150,000 households, 300,000 people, including 100,000 single young and middle-aged people, with a plan to reclaim 400,000 hectares. The resettlement methods are: first, to establish 334 new villages (collective farms), each with more than 200 households and 700-800 hectares of land; second, to establish new agricultural production cooperatives or as branches of old cooperatives in existing villages and settlements; and third, to disperse them in existing cooperatives.

The Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team arrived in Luobei County and immediately received enthusiastic support from young people across the country. To this day, they receive dozens of letters from young people from all over the country every day, some with gifts or donations of production funds. Among the letters they received, more than a hundred were applications to join the reclamation team. The first sixty volunteers have already reclaimed eighty hectares of land and are living a stable life. Now, another 150 young people from Hebei Province and Tianjin are joining the youth reclamation team. They are currently logging timber, preparing materials for building five hundred houses next year, because three thousand young people will come here to reclaim land next spring. By 1957, a total of six thousand young people will settle here, establishing sixteen collective farms and cultivating 20,000 hectares of land. Honey River, only sixty miles away from this reclamation area, is the reclamation area organized by five hundred young people from Harbin. The farmers of Luobei County have already built houses for them, and the Baoquanling State Farm has cleared the wasteland for them. Now, a hundred young people from Harbin have arrived here, and this new village will be established next spring. Near the State-owned Friendship Farm in Jixian County, 220 young people from Laiyang County, Shandong Province, have settled down. The State-owned Friendship Farm has cleared 1,200 hectares of wasteland for them, plowing the land soft and flat, ready for planting next spring. On the beautiful northern shore of Xingkai Lake, local farmers have already cleared 3,500 hectares of wasteland, preparing to welcome a thousand households of immigrants from Shandong to establish three new villages here. Huanan County has built seven hundred houses to welcome five hundred households of immigrants from Henan Province, and in order to take care of the customs of the new masters, they have not built the large houses and opposite kangs commonly used by local farmers, but have built small, single-room houses with partitions in the Henan style.

The immigrants received preferential treatment from the state and proper care from the local people. As long as they work hard, their lives will soon be improved. In 1955, of the 10,086 immigrant households from Shandong, more than 9,000 joined cooperatives. According to the preliminary distribution calculations of the agricultural production cooperatives in Nehe, Keshan, and Qing'an counties, 60% of the immigrants earned between 15 and 40 shi (each shi is 450 jin) of grain per household. Xu Xiushan, an immigrant from Kouguan Township, Wulian County, Shandong Province, came to Zizhi Village, Keshan County, in May this year. Before they arrived in the village, the villagers vacated a house for him, cleaned it, heated the kang, laid new kang mats, and prepared some necessary furniture. After they arrived, they joined the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative. The members saw that his family's quilts were thin, so they passed a resolution at the members' meeting to have the cooperative pay for a new cotton quilt for him. His family wanted to make soybean paste, and the people in the same courtyard lent him a large jar. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the cooperative lent him 20 jin of white flour and 4 jin of pork. In early October, before it got cold, the village Party branch made a decision to ensure that the Shandong immigrants in the village would wear new cotton clothes in early October. After joining the cooperative, Xu Xiushan quickly mastered the local agricultural techniques. Seeing that he was fair and just, everyone elected him as a member of the cooperative's management committee. His family worked at least 250 workdays this year, and adding the production of their private plots, they can earn at least 10,000 jin of grain. With this income, after paying for the cooperative's share fund and repaying the neighbors' loans, and preparing for next year's production investment, the remaining money can be used to improve their lives.

Zhou Jifu, an immigrant from Xiangyang Village, Nehe County, can earn 210 workdays for his whole family. They plan that, in addition to repaying the investment in joining the cooperative, agricultural taxes, horse feed, seeds, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund, they can also distribute more than 20 shi of grain. In the first preliminary distribution, his family received 304 yuan. The whole family made new cotton clothes, added new quilts and daily necessities, and raised two large fat pigs.

However, the fruits of labor are not easily obtained. Although the land is fertile, it is necessary to put in hard work to reclaim it. The Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team lived in tents while clearing the land. The mosquitoes bit their faces swollen, and they said: Enduring a little now is for future happiness. When all the land in the Great Northern Wilderness is reclaimed, there will naturally not be so many mosquitoes. When the reclamation team first arrived, it rained every day, and the team members worked in the rain. In order to create a better life, they fought against difficulties in this way. The immigrants from Shandong saw that the local folks treated them so well, and they put down their luggage and joined the production. Gao Deping, an immigrant from Tongsheng Village, Qing'an County, did not take a day off except when it rained heavily, and received a "full attendance" reward from the cooperative.

Come on, whether you are young people, adults from rural areas of Shandong, Hebei, Henan... or agricultural technicians, junior high school graduates, or farmers who feel that there is not enough land to cultivate in your hometown, when the People's Government is planning to organize immigration and reclamation, you are welcome to come and reclaim this wilderness. Heilongjiang is beckoning to you!

    黑龙江在招手
    本报记者　方青
    在祖国东北角的黑龙江省，正在开始进行一个规模越来越宏大的工程——开垦广阔无边的肥沃荒原。
    到过黑龙江省的人，没有不赞美这里的富饶土地的。是的，黑龙江的土地是迷人的。这里的土壤是带有大量腐殖质的草甸黑钙土、淋溶黑钙土，或者是生草灰化土。因为这种土壤里腐殖质多，酸碱度适中，自然就适合一般植物的生长。这种土壤结构松散，雨水能渗透下去，储存起来，等到干旱时期，水分便沿着毛细管输送到植物上去。就是说：这种土壤既能抗旱，又能抗涝。据省土地勘测局的估计，全省有可垦荒地六百万公顷。
    黑龙江地区比较寒冷，“零下四十度”，这是好多人所最担心的事。要知道只有少数地方又是在很短的期间里才这样冷，因为有大小兴安岭这两个天然屏障，挡住了西伯利亚的寒流。拿紧靠黑龙江的萝北县来说，历史上有记录以来的最低气温是一九五三年的一天，曾降到摄氏零下三十七度。根据记录，全省年平均温度是摄氏零度到四度，特别是农作物生长期间气温很高，佳木斯七月份平均温度是二十三度二。无霜期最短的地区是一百二十天，最多一百六十天。年降雨量是四百到六百公厘。这样的自然条件是非常适合于小麦、玉米、高粱、大豆、谷子、水稻的生长的。不但如此，齐齐哈尔、绥棱县已经是北纬四十七度以上的地方，试种苹果也成功了，这些地区已经在三年前就吃到本地苹果了。
    一提起到东北开荒，你可能想到老辈的人们“下关东”的情景。不错，在旧社会就有不少山东人到黑龙江来。他们只有一条扁担，两个筐子，一头担着简单的行李和锅灶，一头担着孩子，老婆在后面拄着棍跟着走，忍饥挨饿，到了北大荒。自己没有车马，就得给地主开荒。地主又是从“荒揽头”手里买来的荒地。这些“荒揽头”手下有一帮人，专管“跑马占荒”，卖给地主，算是“卖荒照”。经过一层手，剥上一层皮，开荒的人到头来还免不了“地了，场光，衣裳破”，还得挨饿受冻……但是，如今不是那个时代了。现在开荒，不但不会受任何人的剥削和敲诈勒索，而且可以得到国家津贴的路费，来到以后就有暖房热炕，开荒三年不交公粮……
    国家正在为开垦荒地作着各种准备。现在，土地勘测局正集中一千名勘测人员，分别在穆棱河、萝北、黑龙江省西部三地勘测，并在五十四个县份里勘测小片荒地。他们去的地方，常常都是别人没有去过的，而且，经常是一天换一个住宿地。小灌木把他们的手刺得布满伤疤，把衣服撕成碎片。有时走在一人多高的草丛里，要用绳子把人联在一起，才不致失掉联络。在多雨的季节，他们经常是用雨衣把一些办公用品和口粮裹起来，走到那里，背到那里……东北地质学院学生王振燕给他的朋友写信说：“我们要把这个地方变成和洞庭湖区一样，成为祖国的鱼米之乡。”
    这一切，都是为了制定一个巨大的开荒计划。估计将在第二个五年计划到第三个五年计划期间，开完这六百万公顷荒地。现在已经确定：建立和扩大六个大型国营农场，一九五六年国营农场将要开荒十万公顷左右，等于八年来黑龙江省国营农场开荒面积的总和。还要成立八个拖拉机垦荒站，下面是九十个拖拉机垦荒队，将来它们要发展成为农业机器站。另外就是积极发动当地农民开荒，组织青年垦荒队和关内移民到这里来开荒安家。一九五六年黑龙江省接受移民的计划就是十五万户、三十万人，其中有单身青壮年十万人，计划开荒四十万公顷。安置的办法，一是建立三百三十四个新村（集体农庄），每村二百多户，七、八百公顷土地；二是在原有村屯建立新的农业生产合作社或作为老社的分社，三是分散安置在原有合作社里。
    北京市青年志愿垦荒队到了萝北县，立即得到全国青年的热烈支持，直到现在，他们每天都要收到几十封各地青年写来的信，有的信附带了一些赠品或捐献的生产基金。他们接到的信里有一百多封是志愿要求参加这个垦荒队的。志愿垦荒队先来的六十人已经开出来八十公顷地，并且过着安定的生活。现在又有河北省和天津市的一百五十名青年，参加了这个青年垦荒队。他们现在正在伐木，准备明年建筑五百间房子的木材，因为明年一开春就要有三千名青年到这里来开荒。到一九五七年总共将有六千个青年在这里安家，分别成立十六个集体农庄，耕种两万公顷土地。跟这个垦荒区相距只有六十里路的蜂蜜河子，是哈尔滨市组织的五百名青年的垦荒区，萝北县的农民已经为他们盖好了房子，宝泉岭国营农场给他们开好了荒地，现在已经有一百个哈尔滨的青年来到这里，明年春天这个新村就建立起来了。在集贤县的国营友谊农场附近，有来自山东莱阳县的二百二十名青年安了家，国营友谊农场已经给他们开好了一千二百公顷荒地，把地耙得又松软又平整，来年一开春就可以播种。在幽美的兴凯湖北岸，已经由当地农民开了三千五百公顷荒地，准备迎接山东的一千户移民，在这里建立三个新村。桦南县为迎接河南省的五百户移民，已经盖好了七百间房子，并且为了照顾新主人的风俗习惯，没有盖成当地农民习用的大房子、对面炕，而是盖成河南式的有间壁的单间小房。
    移民们受到了国家的优待和当地人民的妥善照顾，只要努力生产，生活很快就得到了改善。一九五五年，山东来的一万零八十六户移民，其中有九千多户都加入了合作社，据讷河、克山、庆安三个县农业生产合作社预分的计算，百分之六十的移民每户收入粮食十五石到四十石（每石四百五十市斤）。山东省五莲县叩官乡移民徐秀山是今年五月间到克山县自治村来的，他们还没有到村的时候，村里的人们就给他腾出房子，打扫干净，烧热了炕，铺上新炕席，还准备了一些必要的家具。他们到了以后，就参加了第三农业生产合作社。社员们看见他家的被子薄些，便通过社员大会由社里出钱给他做一床新棉被。他家想做黄酱，同院的人又借给一口大缸。过中秋节的时候，社里又借给他二十斤白面，四斤猪肉。十月初，还没有冷的时候，村的党支部就作出决定：保证本村山东移民在十月上旬穿上新棉衣。徐秀山入社以后，很快就掌握了当地的农业技术；大伙看他办事公道，选他当了社里的管理委员。他家今年至少作了二百五十个劳动日，加上自留地的生产，至少能分一万斤粮食。这笔收入，除了交合作社的股份基金，还邻居的借款，准备明年的生产投资，剩下的钱就可以用来改善生活。
    讷河县向阳村移民周继福，全家可挣二百一十个劳动日，他们计划：除了补交入社的投资、公粮、马料、种籽、公积金、公益金以外，还能分二十多石粮。第一次预分，他家分得了三百零四元，全家都作了新棉衣，添置了新被和日用家具，还饲养两头大肥猪。
    但是，劳动果实不是轻易得来的。土地虽说肥沃，一定要付出艰苦的劳动，才可以开垦出来。北京市青年志愿垦荒队是在帐篷里住着开荒的。蚊子把他们的脸咬肿了，他们说：现在忍受点，就是为了将来的幸福，将来北大荒的地都开垦出来，自然就没有这么多蚊子了。垦荒队刚到的时候，天天下雨，队员们就顶着雨开荒。为了创造美好的生活，他们就是这样同困难搏斗的。山东来的移民们看到当地老乡待他们那么好，放下行李，就参加生产。庆安县同胜村移民高德平，除了下大雨，没有歇一天工，得到社里的“满勤”奖励。
    来吧，不论你是山东、河北、河南……各地农村的青年、壮年们，或者你是农业技术员、高小毕业生，或者是在你家乡感到地不够种的农民们，在人民政府有计划地组织移民开垦的时候，欢迎你们来开垦这里的荒原吧，黑龙江在向你招手！
