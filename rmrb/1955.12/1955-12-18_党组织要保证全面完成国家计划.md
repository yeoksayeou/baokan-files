At the end of 1954, a serious problem confronted the Party organization of the Datong Ephedrine Factory. The factory had failed to fulfill the state plan for nine months of the year, and had failed to meet the state's cost reduction targets for eleven months. There was serious waste within the factory, but all the employees seemed to be oblivious. Tools were broken and not repaired, lost and not investigated; materials were requisitioned when needed, and issued as soon as they were received. Every month-end settlement revealed cost overruns, but the reaction was merely an "Oh dear!" Everyone seemed to think, "I need something, you have to give it to me, otherwise, you're responsible if production is affected," "You can't expect everything to be perfect; with such a big factory, there's bound to be waste!" But at this time, the state demanded that the factory reduce costs by 15.88 percent in 1955. What to do? The branch committee, acting on instructions from the municipal committee, resolved to implement the Soviet advanced experience of the team economic accounting system throughout the factory.

The implementation of this resolution was not smooth sailing; it was met with resistance from various conservative ideas from the start. Almost all employees believed that the key lay in technology, not in accounting. They said pessimistically, "No matter how you calculate it, you can't calculate ephedrine!" In response to this situation, the branch organized mass meetings and group study sessions, and mobilized Party members and Party propagandists to go deep into workshops and teams to patiently publicize the political and economic significance of team economic accounting, repeatedly explaining the principles of how team economic accounting can save materials, reduce costs, and increase production; how it can strengthen employee supervision of enterprises, improve enterprise management, and accumulate more factory funds, thereby improving employees' material and cultural lives. After this repeated and in-depth publicity and explanation, most employees' resistance gradually disappeared, and they were willing to participate in team economic accounting. However, many people still held a skeptical "wait and see" attitude. Soon after the implementation of team economic accounting, workers in the soaking grass team, after cost analysis, first proposed a guarantee to "reduce material input and increase output," which reduced the team's costs by 2.5 percent. The branch immediately seized on this vivid fact and publicized it. Subsequently, the refining team, the air pump team, and the ointment boiling team all found ways to save money and reduce costs. As a result, in January and February of this year, the entire factory comprehensively fulfilled the state plan, and the costs for the two months were not reduced by 15.88 percent compared to last year, but by more than 19 percent. This finally made all employees realize the great significance of implementing the team economic accounting system. Next, the branch held consecutive Party member meetings to study how Party members could mobilize all workers to actively participate in team economic accounting. Specific tasks were assigned to each Party member. Zhang Chengfu, a worker in the ointment boiling team, used to have the attitude of "doing his job for the day and getting paid for the day." Party member Han Fuxiang enlightened his class consciousness by using the contrast between his past and present life to explain the different meanings of labor in the past and present. After this kind of kind and patient help, his work attitude changed. At a cost analysis meeting, he proposed a method of "controlling water content in the coal, adding coal frequently, and scraping the pot frequently," which greatly reduced coal consumption and lowered the team's costs by 16 percent. Another example is Luo Wenbiao, a worker in the small distillation team, who used to clock in on time and clock out on time, lacking enthusiasm for work, let alone creativity. When team economic accounting was first implemented, he often did not participate, and when he did, he did not speak. After Party member Xue Jiujing talked to him individually many times, he began to actively participate in the team's cost analysis meetings. In July, he proposed a rationalization proposal of "batch feeding," which increased the yield of crude ephedrine by 6.25 percent.

On the basis of promoting the team economic accounting system, the branch also launched a struggle against waste. First, it mobilized the masses of workers to use the method of detailed accounting to make everyone aware of the seriousness of waste. After detailed accounting, everyone was shocked. In 1954 alone, workshop expenses and management fees exceeded the budget by more than 68,000 yuan, and the waste, backlog, and excess reserves of raw materials amounted to more than 289,000 yuan. The refining team established the team's eight financial systems and adopted strict management methods through detailed accounting. In this way, an atmosphere of saving is glorious and waste is shameful was gradually established among all employees. In the past, machine parts with minor problems were often thrown into the scrap iron pile, but now these parts are picked up from the scrap iron pile, repaired, and used; in the past, the cloth bags used on centrifuges were thrown away as soon as they were slightly damaged, but now they are repaired and continued to be used; in the past, raw materials were thrown around everywhere, but now even a broom has to be clamped with splints to be used. This greatly saved expenses. For example, Workshop Two used to need an average of 1,500 yuan per month for repairs, but now it only uses an average of 273 yuan per month.

The branch was not satisfied with these achievements, because blocking the loopholes in waste, establishing a saving system, and forming a saving atmosphere can indeed save a lot of wealth for the country, but in order to create more wealth for the country, it is necessary to carry out technical reforms. The branch committee decided to promote advanced technical experience among all employees, and successively sent more than 20 workers, technicians, and management personnel to brother factories in Northeast China, Shandong, Tianjin, and other places to visit and study. After returning to the factory, they organized reports and discussions to thoroughly overcome the conservative ideas of some employees who were content with the status quo. Then, they organized the promotion of the advanced experience of brother factories. The branch also focused on educating Party members to play a leading role and pay attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of technicians. When the "double-effect distillation method" was first promoted, difficulties arose, and some workers doubted this advanced experience. At this time, the branch assigned Communist Party member and workshop foreman Han Fuxiang to lead veteran technicians to conduct research. They sacrificed their rest time and studied by the machine for a whole day and night, and finally discovered the problem of steam leakage from the flange; so they repaired the flange and adjusted the vacuum degree, and the difficulty was solved, and the "double-effect distillation method" was successfully promoted. When learning the advanced experience of brother factories in soaking grass, the branch specially organized technicians to study the soaking grass problem. After their collective research, they finally created an advanced operation method of "using less material and guaranteeing output." The promotion of this method can reduce raw material consumption by 25 percent. So far, they have learned and promoted 11 kinds of advanced experiences from brother factories. Taking the second section as an example, the recovery rate of ephedrine has increased by 10.5 percent compared to last year.

In the face of new production achievements, the complacency of many employees in the factory is growing again, and the argument of "almost there" is happening again. The branch immediately criticized this harmful thinking, put forward the goals for future efforts, pointed out that the cost of our factory is still higher than the cost of the Chifeng brother factory in Northeast China, pointed out that the cooperation of the current testing work is not close enough, pointed out that the financial department's leadership of team economic accounting is not timely and meticulous enough, and pointed out that some teams still have departmentalism, etc. This enables all employees to always maintain a clear mind in order to continue to overcome shortcomings and strive for new achievements.

    党组织要保证全面完成国家计划
    杨森
    一九五四年年尾，一个严重的问题摆在大同麻黄素厂党组织的面前。这个厂一年内有九个月没有完成国家计划，一年内有十一个月没有达到国家降低成本的指标。厂内有严重的浪费现象，但全体职工仿佛熟视无睹。对工具是坏了不修理，丢了不追问，对材料是有用就领，有领就发。每到月终结算发现成本超支数字，只不过“啊呀！”一声而已。反正大家认为：“我要啥你就得给啥，不然，误了生产你得负责”“糠里还少不了带颗米，这么大的厂子哪能不浪费？”而国家却在这时提出，要这个厂在一九五五年把成本降低百分之十五点八八。怎么办呢？支部委员会就根据市委指示作了决议：在全厂推行苏联的先进经验班组经济核算制。
    这个决议的贯彻执行并不是一帆风顺的，一开始就受到各种保守思想的抵抗。几乎所有职工都认为关键在于技术，而不在于核算。他们消极地说：“任凭你怎么算吧，你也算不出麻黄素来！”支部针对这种思想情况，就通过群众大会小组学习会，并发动党员和党的宣传员，深入车间、小组耐心地宣传班组经济核算的政治意义和经济意义，反复地说明班组经济核算可以节约材料、降低成本、提高生产的道理；可以加强职工对企业的监督、改善企业管理的道理，以及可以积累更多的厂长基金，从而改善职工的物质文化生活的道理。经过这样反复的深入的宣传解释以后，绝大部分职工的抵触情绪逐渐消除，愿意参加班组经济核算了，但是，还有很多人抱着怀疑的“试试看”的态度。班组经济核算推行不久，浸草组工人经过成本分析，首先提出“减少下料，提高产量”的保证，使小组成本降低百分之二点五。支部立即抓住这一活生生的事实进行宣传。接着精制组、风泵组，熬膏组都相继找出了节约的窍门，分别降低了成本。结果，今年一、二两月全厂即全面地完成了国家计划，两个月的成本较去年不是降低百分之十五点八八，而是百分之十九以上。这才使全体职工最后认识到实行班组经济核算制的巨大意义。接着，支部就连续召开党员大会，研究党员如何发动所有工人都积极参加班组经济核算工作的问题。并给每个党员分配了具体任务。熬膏组工人张成富过去对工作是“当一天和尚撞一天钟，干一天工作拿一天薪”的态度。党员韩福祥就用他过去和现在生活的对比说明过去和现在劳动的不同意义去启发他的阶级觉悟，经过这种亲切耐心的帮助，他的劳动态度改变了。在一次成本分析会上，他提出“煤里和水、勤添煤、勤铲锅”的办法，大大减少煤耗，使小组成本降低百分之十六。再如小蒸溜组工人罗文彪，过去是到点上班，到点下班，工作缺乏积极性，更缺乏创造性。开始进行班组经济核算时，他常常不参加，参加了也不发言。经过党员薛九经多次和他个别谈话，他开始积极参加成本分析的小组会了。在七月间他提出“分批落锅”的合理化建议，使草酸素提高了百分之六点二五。
    在推行了班组经济核算制的基础上，支部又发动了反浪费的斗争，首先是发动工人群众采用算细账的办法使大家认识到浪费的严重性。经过算细账，才使大家大吃一惊。一九五四年仅车间经费和管理费就超支了六万八千多元，原材料的浪费、积压和超额储备达二十八万九千多元。精制组通过算细账才建立了小组的八项财务制度，采取了严格的管理方法。这样，就在全体职工中逐步树立了节约光荣、浪费可耻的空气。过去常常是把有点毛病的机器零件扔到了废铁堆上，现在是把这些零件从废铁堆上捡回来修理好使用；过去离心机上用的布包稍破一点就扔了，现在是使破了自己补好继续使用；过去是原材料到处乱扔，现在是一把扫帚也得用夹板夹起来使用。这样就大大节约了开支。例如二车间，去年每月平均需要修理费一千五百元，而今年每月平均只用二百七十三元了。
    支部并没有满足这些成绩，因为堵塞了浪费的漏洞，建立了节约制度，形成了节约风气，固然可以为国家节省不少财富，但是，为了给国家创造更多的财富，必须从技术上进行改革。支部委员会就决定在全体职工中推广先进技术经验，并先后派出工人、技术人员、管理人员二十多人到东北、山东、天津等地的兄弟厂参观和学习，回厂以后，组织报告和讨论，彻底克服部分职工安于现状的保守思想，接着就组织推广兄弟厂的先进经验。支部并着重教育党员要起带头作用，并注意发挥技术人员的积极性。在开始推广“双效蒸溜法”的时候产生了困难，个别工人对这一先进经验因此发生了怀疑。这个时候，支部就分配共产党员、车间工长韩福祥领导老技术工人进行研究。他们牺牲了休息时间在机器旁边整整研究了一天一夜，终于发现了法兰盘漏汽问题；于是修理了法兰盘，调整了真空度数，困难迎刃而解，“双效蒸溜法”推广成功了。在学习兄弟厂浸草的先进经验的时候，支部专门组织了技术人员研究浸草问题，经过他们的集体钻研，最后创造了“少下材料，保证产量”的先进操作方法。这个方法推广后，可使原材料消耗减少百分之二十五。到目前为止，他们已经学习和推广了兄弟厂的先进经验十一种。以第二工段为例，从麻黄素的收得率来看，已比去年提高百分之十点五。
    在新的生产成绩面前，厂里不少职工的自满情绪又在滋长，“差不多了”的论调又在发生。支部就立即批判了这种有害的思想，提出了今后努力的目标，指出本厂的成本比东北赤峰兄弟厂的成本还高，指出目前化验工作的配合还不够密切，指出财务部门对班组经济核算的领导还不够及时和细致，指出有些小组还有本位主义思想等等。这就使全体职工能够经常保持清醒的头脑，以便继续克服缺点，争取新的成就。
