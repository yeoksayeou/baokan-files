Strive to Help Minority Nationalities Create Written Languages
Fu Maoji

Our country is a multi-ethnic nation. Although the development of various minority nationalities is still very uneven, they must all transition to a socialist society together with the Han nationality. As our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation are accelerating across the country, the development of cultural and educational undertakings of all nationalities must also advance at a corresponding pace. However, many of our country's minority nationalities do not yet have written languages representing their own languages, or their written languages are incomplete and cannot well adapt to modern needs. This situation, especially the lack of written languages, seriously hinders the rapid development of these nationalities in politics, economy, and culture. Therefore, the State Council's "Several Decisions on Ethnic Affairs" in 1951 already included the instruction to "help nationalities that do not yet have written languages to create them, and help nationalities whose written languages are incomplete to gradually enrich them." In our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, there was also the provision that "for those nationalities that do not yet have written languages, efforts should be made to help them create their own written languages." Obviously, as we face the increasingly high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement today, helping minority nationalities create, improve, and reform written languages has become a task that our ethnic language workers must accelerate to complete.

The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and ethnic language institutions in various regions have done some work in accordance with the State Council's instructions and the provisions of the first Five-Year Plan. Some investigation and research work has been carried out on the Zhuang, Yi, Miao, Bouyei, Dai, Kawa, Hani, Yao, Lisu, Nong, Naxi, Lahu, and Jingpo languages of the Sino-Tibetan language family; the Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Dongxiang, Tu, Daur, and Xibe languages of the Altaic language family; the Kawa language of the Austro-Asiatic language family; and the Tajik language of the Indo-European language family. Latin alphabet-based designs have been made for Yi, Zhuang, and Lisu scripts, and enrichment and improvement work has been done on Uyghur, Kazakh, Dai, Jingpo, and Lahu scripts. However, some of these written language schemes have not yet been finalized for trial implementation, and some have been finalized for trial implementation but have not yet compiled a complete set of teaching materials. The work of training cadres to experiment with promotion has only just begun. Many ethnic autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties cannot use their own written languages to perform their duties; many ethnic areas' factories, trade organizations, banks, and hospitals are looking forward to using ethnic written languages to conduct business; thousands upon thousands of agricultural cooperatives lack literate accountants and other staff; many ethnic schools are looking forward to textbooks in various subjects in ethnic languages; and Han cadres working in ethnic areas also urgently need to learn local languages through ethnic written languages to better serve minority nationalities. All of this proves that our ethnic language work lags far behind the needs of national construction and cannot meet the urgent demands of the broad masses of minority nationalities.

The National Language Science Symposium recently held in Beijing affirmed the achievements of past work and also pointed out some shortcomings. The most important shortcomings are that the scope of work is too narrow and the progress is too slow. Representatives of various ethnic groups have requested that written languages be created quickly, some have requested that written languages be improved quickly, and some have also requested assistance in reforming written languages. To meet these requirements, to adapt to the needs of national construction, we should basically finalize various written language creation and improvement schemes in the next few years, and specific reform methods should also be proposed for written languages that need to be reformed. Those that already have preliminary written language schemes should be discussed and studied to finalize them as soon as possible, and those that have already been finalized should be experimented with and promoted as soon as possible. To complete this major task, we must expand the scope of work and do the following:

I. Make a comprehensive plan: In the past, we only saw the strength of a few people in front of us, were constrained, and lacked experience, so we could not fully develop our work. The situation is different now: we have collected a lot of materials, accumulated some experience, and have the help of Soviet advisors and experts. Students in more than a dozen language classes in the Department of Languages of the Central Institute for Nationalities are about to graduate, and local ethnic language cadres are also growing. Therefore, a comprehensive plan should be made based on a full estimate of the forces that can be invested in this work. The existing language work institutions should be enriched, and some new language institutions should be established in various places as needed. For each nationality that needs to create, improve, and reform written languages, a deadline should be set for investigation and research, proposal of written language schemes, and trial implementation. The plans of various ethnic language research institutions, education, culture, and publishing institutions, and cadre training schools should be linked and closely coordinated.

II. Boldly use young cadres: In the past, we were not bold enough in using young cadres. But the working ability of young cadres must be improved through training at work. After the scope of work is expanded, there will not be enough experienced language scientists to allocate. As long as young cadres can be concentrated for rigorous training, they can be sent to work, and experienced language scientists can then go to help them regularly, and the work can be done well. After the written language scheme is determined, there is still much work to be done. Only with the continuous growth of new language scientists can this work be continued and deepened.

III. Give full play to the strength of the masses, especially the strength of cadres of their own nationality: Relying only on the strength of a few people cannot complete any written language creation, improvement, or reform work well. The nationalities are already familiar with their own languages, and as long as they have language science knowledge, they can study their own languages and create their own written languages. Even if their language science knowledge is not enough, they only need to be helped to summarize the phoneme system, and they can be told some methods for further work, and they can also play a great role in the work. Therefore, we must especially focus on giving full play to the strength of cadres of our own nationality. The cultural level of some ethnic cadres is relatively low, but their strength must not be underestimated because of this. Some of the ethnic cadres in the language work institutions now do not even have the cultural level of senior primary school, but they do play a great role in their work. Of course, in order for these cadres to be able to undertake more in-depth research work, it is necessary to help them improve their cultural level and continue to strengthen their professional studies in a planned way.

IV. Strengthen policy and business leadership: The creation, improvement, and reform of written languages is scientific research work, mass work, and an important political task in national construction. Therefore, the work can only be done well with strong policy leadership and business leadership. Every working cadre must conscientiously study ethnic policies, respect the customs and characteristics of various ethnic groups, obey unified leadership, and strictly abide by work discipline. Every important work, such as dividing dialects, selecting basic dialects, determining written language schemes, and improving alphabet systems, needs to be fully discussed and reported to the leadership for instructions. Han cadres participating in this work must especially prevent great Han chauvinism and avoid the style of monopolizing everything; minority ethnic cadres must also prevent local nationalism and consider the overall interests of the nation everywhere. In past work, some comrades, based on their own hobbies and habits, insisted on certain individual letter forms without principle or insisted on using the dialect of a certain area as the basic dialect, making the work protracted and unresolved. This is a violation of the interests of the people and the state. In the future, we must adhere to correct principles and methods, abandon personal hobbies and habits that are not conducive to the whole, so that our work can be rapidly developed.

Creating a written language is a complex and meticulous task. While we are accelerating the speed, we must not forget to ensure the quality of the work. The national language situation in our country is very complicated. Some nationalities with the same name have very different languages, some nationalities with different names speak the same language, and we do not yet know anything about the situation of some languages. We need to conduct a comprehensive survey in the next two years to roughly grasp the relationship between various languages and dialects, so that we can consider the issue of phonetic writing in connection with the relationship between languages and dialects. While conducting a universal survey, we should promptly carry out the work of creating, improving, and reforming written languages according to the progress of various language studies. The process of creating a written language should include the following main steps:

I. Investigate and study dialects: Conduct a universal survey of the dialects in various settlements of a nationality, collect materials on vocabulary, grammar, phonetics, etc., determine how many dialects there are, and delineate the scope of each dialect area. If each dialect is divided into several sub-dialects, their scope should also be explained, and the characteristics of each dialect and sub-dialect should be pointed out. An estimated figure should be given for the population of each dialect and sub-dialect, so that it is easy to explain which ones are more universal among the various dialects and sub-dialects.

II. Select the basic dialect and standard pronunciation of the standard language: When investigating dialects, we must also investigate the political, economic, and cultural development of various regions. After having language and other related materials, we can choose the regional dialect with greater language universality and that best reflects the general law of this language development and is more developed in politics, economy, and culture as the basic dialect. If the phoneme system in this basic dialect area is inconsistent, we must also select the pronunciation of one place as the standard pronunciation. The vocabulary and grammar of the standard language should be based on the basic dialect, but the pronunciation should be based on the standard pronunciation system. The work of selecting the basic dialect should be handled flexibly according to the specific situation.

III. Formulate a written language scheme: According to the phoneme system of the standard pronunciation, and with reference to the situation of other dialects and sub-dialects, formulate a phonetic alphabet that can most succinctly represent this system. When formulating the phonetic alphabet, the uniformly stipulated alphabet principles should be followed. Although special pronunciations can have special treatment methods, staff members must not change the uniformly stipulated principles according to their own preferences, creating unprincipled differences. When submitting it to the leading agency for review, sufficient materials should be submitted to explain that the selection of the basic dialect and standard pronunciation is correct, and the alphabet system and spelling rules are reasonable.

IV. Compile teaching materials, reading materials, dictionaries, grammar, and reference books: After the written language scheme is designed, textbooks, adult textbooks, and popular reading materials for schools must be compiled; orthography and orthoepy must be studied, and orthoepy dictionaries must be compiled; grammatical structures must be studied in depth, and grammatical outlines must be compiled. If some dialects are very different from the basic dialect, reference books for learning the standard language must also be compiled for people in these dialect areas. If some dialects are too different from the basic dialect, but there is no need to create another written language, we must also compile some introductory textbooks specifically for these areas to facilitate learning the standard language. In addition, picture magazines and newspapers should also be published.

V. Negotiate the principles for creating new words and correctly develop new words: A large number of new words have already been produced in the languages of various ethnic groups. These new words should be collected and the rules of their formation should be studied. Under unified principles and planning, new words (including loan words) should be determined and created, and then new word dictionaries should be compiled. This work should be carried out simultaneously with the above-mentioned work of compiling teaching materials and reading materials.

VI. Comprehensively study the relationship between the basic dialect and the standard language, and gradually determine the norms of the standard language: The standard language has both written and spoken forms. In our country, which is building a socialist society, not only the spoken standard language, but even the written standard language must be established and developed on the basis of a certain living spoken language. This living spoken language basis is the basic dialect that has been selected. However, the standard language is much richer than the basic dialect. It can absorb everything that the basic dialect does not have and is needed by the standard language from other dialects, older literature, and other languages. Language is constantly developing forward. We must also study the internal laws of language development, and comply with these laws to determine the norms of pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, so that the content of the standard language becomes richer and richer, and the effectiveness of the standard language becomes higher and higher. In addition, we must promptly check and study the problems found in practice in various aspects. We must study the policy documents, literary works, newspapers and periodicals translated and written in ethnic languages, as well as the languages used in teaching, broadcasting, music, drama, and film, and solve all problems related to language standardization at any time.

If there is already a written language, and only the work of improving the written language is carried out, or if the original written language is not suitable and another written language is created, the structural principles of the original written language and the relationship between the written language and the language must also be studied.

From this, it can be seen that creating, improving, and reforming written languages is a complex and arduous task. There are dozens of nationalities in our country that need to solve the problem of written languages, and naturally it cannot be done perfectly in the short term. But as long as we can determine the written language schemes in the next few years, and can use these schemes to write these languages, and then gradually conduct in-depth research and continue to solve many problems related to the standardization of the standard language in practice, we will be able to adapt to the urgent needs of our country's construction. In the work of creating written languages, we will inevitably encounter some difficulties, but we believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the wisdom of the masses, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and victoriously complete this arduous and glorious task.

    努力帮助少数民族创立文字
    傅懋勣
    我国是一个多民族的国家。虽然各少数民族的发展目前还是很不平衡的，但是都要和汉族共同过渡到社会主义社会。当我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造在全国范围内加速前进的时期，各民族的文化教育事业的发展也必须相应地加快速度地前进。可是我国有许多少数民族还没有代表自己的语言的文字，或有文字而不完备，不能很好地适应现代的需要。这种情况，特别是没有文字的情况，严重地阻碍了这些民族在政治、经济和文化上的迅速发展。因此，一九五一年政务院“关于民族事务的几项决定”中，早就有“帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字，帮助文字不完备的民族逐渐充实其文字”的指示。在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，也有“对于那些还没有文字的民族，应该努力地帮助他们创造自己的文字”的规定。很显然，在我们面临着农业合作化运动日益高涨的形势的今天，帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字已经成为我们民族语文工作者必须加速完成的任务。
    中国科学院语言研究所、中央民族学院和各地民族语文机构遵照政务院的指示和第一个五年计划的规定，已经做了一些工作。对于汉藏语系的僮、彝、苗、布依、傣、佧瓦、哈尼、瑶、傈僳、侬、纳西、拉祜、景颇等语言，阿尔泰语系的蒙古、维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、东乡、土族、达呼尔、锡伯等语言，南亚语系的佧瓦语和印欧语系的塔吉克语，都进行了一些调查研究工作。以拉丁字母为基础设计了彝文、僮文和傈僳文，并且对维吾尔文、哈萨克文、傣文、景颇文、拉祜文做了充实和改进的工作。但其中有些文字方案还没有确定试行，有些已经确定了试行方案，还没有编译出整套的教材，培养试验推行干部的工作也才开始。许多民族自治区、自治州和自治县还不能用自己的文字执行职务；不少的民族地区的工厂、贸易机构、银行、卫生院都期待着使用民族文字办事；成千成万的农业合作社缺少懂文字的会计员和其他办事人员；许多民族学校盼望着民族语文的各科教科书；在民族地区工作的汉族干部也迫切需要通过民族文字学习当地的语言，以便于更好地为少数民族服务。这一切都证明了我们的民族语文工作远远落后于国家建设的需要，不能满足少数民族人民大众的迫切要求。
    最近在北京举行的民族语文科学讨论会，肯定了过去工作的成绩，也指出了一些缺点。最主要的缺点就是工作面太窄，进度也太慢。各族代表们有的要求赶快创立文字，有的要求赶快改进文字，也有的要求帮助改革文字。为了满足这些要求，为了适应国家建设的需要，我们应该在近几年内基本上确定各种文字的创立和改进方案，需要改革的文字也应该提出具体的改革办法。已经有了初步文字方案的，应该赶快讨论研究确定下来，已经确定下来的，应该赶快实验推行。为了完成这个重大的任务，我们必须展开工作面，做好以下各项工作：
    一、做出全面的规划：过去我们只看到眼前少数人的力量，束手束脚，同时缺少经验，所以不能全面地展开工作。现在的情况已经不同了：我们已经搜集了许多材料，积累了一些经验，又有苏联顾问和专家的帮助，中央民族学院语文系有十几种语言班的学生就要毕业了，各地方的本族语文干部也在成长着。因此，应该在充分估计可以投入这件工作的力量的基础上，做出全面的规划。把现有的语文工作机构加以充实，并根据需要在各地建立一些新的语文机构。对需要创立、改进和改革文字工作的每个民族，都要确定调查研究、提出文字方案和试验推行的期限。各个民族语文研究机构，教育、文化、出版机构，培养干部的学校的计划都要互相衔接和紧密地配合。
    二、大胆地使用青年干部：过去我们在使用青年干部方面是不够大胆的。但是青年干部的工作能力是要靠工作中的锻炼来提高的。工作面展开以后，有经验的语言科学家是不够分配的。只要能把青年干部集中起来加以严格的训练，就可以派他们去工作，有经验的语言科学家再经常去帮助他们，也就能把工作做好。确定了文字方案以后，还有许多工作要继续进行，只有新的语言科学家不断地成长，才能把这些工作继续并深入下去。
    三、发挥群众的力量特别是本民族干部的力量：只靠少数人的力量是不能很好地完成任何一种文字创立、改进或改革的工作的。本民族已经熟习了自己的语言，只要有了语言科学知识，就能自己研究自己的语言，创立自己的文字。即使他们的语言科学知识不够，只须帮助他们归纳出音位系统，告诉他们一些进一步工作的方法，他们也能在工作中起很大的作用。因此，我们必须特别着重发挥本民族干部的力量。有些民族干部的文化水平是比较低的，但是决不能因此看轻他们的力量。现在在语文工作机构中的本民族干部有些连高级小学的文化水平也没有，可是他们在工作中的确也起着很大的作用。当然，为了使这些干部能担任更深入的研究工作，有计划地帮助他们提高文化水平，继续加强业务学习，是十分必要的。
    四、加强政策和业务的领导：创立、改进和改革文字是科学研究工作，也是群众性的工作，也是国家建设中的一个重要的政治任务。因此必须有坚强的政策领导和业务领导才能把工作做好。每个工作干部都要认真学习民族政策，尊重各民族的风俗习惯和特点，服从统一的领导，严守工作纪律。每一项重要工作，如划分方言，选择基础方言，决定文字方案，改进字母系统，都需要经过充分讨论，向领导方面请示汇报。参加这一工作的汉族干部尤其要防止大民族主义倾向，力戒包办代替的作风；少数民族干部也要防止地方民族主义倾向，处处要考虑民族的整体利益。在过去的工作中，曾有些同志根据自己的爱好和习惯，无原则地坚持某些个别字母形式或坚持用某一地区的方言做基础方言，使工作旷日持久得不到解决。这是违反人民大众和国家利益的。我们今后一定要做到坚持正确的原则和方法，放弃不利于整体的个人爱好和习惯，使我们的工作能得到迅速的开展。
    创立文字是一件复杂而又细致的工作，我们在加快速度的时候同时不能忘记保证工作的质量。全国民族语言的情况是很复杂的，有些名称相同的民族，语言差别很大，有些不同名称的民族说的是一种语言，有些语言的情况我们还完全不知道。我们需要在最近两年内进行全面的调查，大体上掌握各种语言、方言之间的关系以后，才能按照语言、方言的关系联系起来考虑拼音文字的问题。在普遍调查的同时，应按照各种语言研究的进度，及时地进行创立、改进和改革文字的工作。创立一种文字的过程，应包括以下几个主要步骤：
    一、调查研究方言：对一个民族各个聚居区的方言作普遍调查，搜集词汇、语法、语音等方面的材料，确定有几个方言，划定各个方言区的范围。如果每个方言又分成几个土语，也应该说明它们的范围，指出各个方言和土语的特点。对每种方言和土语的人口要有一个估计数字，以便于说明在各个方言和土语中间哪些是比较有普遍性的。
    二、选择标准语的基础方言和标准音：在调查方言的时候，还要同时调查各地区政治、经济和文化发展的情况。有了语言和其他有关材料以后，就可以选择语言的普遍性较大、而且最能反映出这种语言发展的一般规律和政治、经济、文化上比较发达的地域方言做基础方言。如果这个基础方言地区的音位系统不一致，还得选一个地方的语音做标准音。标准语的词汇和语法要拿基础方言做根据，但是语音要依据标准音的系统。选择基础方言的工作要根据具体情况灵活处理。
    三、拟订文字方案：根据标准音的音位系统，参考其他方言土语的情况，制定最能精简地代表这个系统的拼音字母。制定拼音字母的时候，要依照统一规定的字母原则。特殊的语音虽然可以有特殊的处理办法，但是工作人员不能根据自己的爱好改变统一规定的原则，造成无原则的纷歧。送请领导机构审查的时候，要提出足够的材料，来说明基础方言和标准音的选择是正确的，字母系统和拼写规则是合理的。
    四、编写教材、读物、词典、语法和参考书：文字方案设计完成以后，便要编写学校中的教科书、成人课本和通俗读物；研究正字法和正音法，编写正音词典；深入研究语法构造，编写语法纲要。如果有些方言和基础方言差别很大，还得给这些方言区的人编写学习标准语的参考书。如果有的方言和基础方言差别太大，但是用不着另造一种文字，我们还得给这些地区特别编写一些初学的课本，以便学习标准语。另外，还要出版画刊和报纸。
    五、商订创立新词的原则，正确地发展新词：现在各族语言里已经产生了大量的新词，应该搜集这些新词并研究它们构成的规律，在统一的原则和规划下，确定并创立新词（包括借词），然后编写新词词典。这件工作应该和上项编写教材读物的工作同时进行。
    六、全面研究基础方言和标准语的关系，逐渐确定标准语的规范：标准语有书面的和口头的两种形式。在我们建设社会主义社会的国家里，不仅口头标准语，连书面标准语也要在一定的活的口语基础上建立和发展起来。这个活的口语基础就是已经选定的基础方言。但是标准语是比基础方言丰富得多的，它可以从别的方言里，较古的文献里，别的语言里吸收一切基础方言所没有而为标准语所需要的东西。语言是不断地向前发展的，我们还要研究语言发展的内部规律，并顺应这些规律确定语音、词汇和语法的规范，使标准语的内容越来越丰富，标准语的效能越来越提高。此外还要及时检查并研究各方面实践中所发现的问题，对于用民族语文译写的政策文件、文艺作品、报纸期刊以及教学、广播、音乐、戏剧、电影中所用的语言，都要加以研究，随时解决有关语言规范化的一切问题。
    如果原来已经有书面语言，而只进行文字改进的工作或原来文字不适用另行创立文字，还要研究原来文字的结构原则以及文字和语言的关系。
    由此看来，创立、改进和改革文字是一件复杂艰巨的工作。我国需要解决文字问题的有几十个民族，自然不能在短期内都做得很完备。但是只要我们能在近几年的时期内，确定文字方案，能运用这些方案书写这些语言，以后再逐渐地深入研究，在实践中继续解决有关标准语规范化的许多问题，也就能适应我国建设的迫切需要了。在创立文字的工作中，一定会遇到一些困难，但是我们相信，在党和政府的领导下，依靠群众的智慧，一定能克服一切困难，胜利地完成这个艰巨而光荣的任务。
