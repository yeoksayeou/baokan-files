Quantity is important, but quality is also important

Since November, the No. 1 Civil Construction District of the Tongchuan Mining Area in Shaanxi Province and the civil construction project of the Wangjiahe No. 2 Vertical Shaft have experienced continuous quality accidents. On November 15th, the No. 1 Construction District's prefabricated concrete lintels for doors and windows were damaged 14 at a time; on the same day, a water storage pool that had been built for less than a day also collapsed. When the stone foundation of the electric winch room of Wangjiahe No. 2 Vertical Shaft was built to a height of nearly two meters, it was discovered that the center line of the winch room was set off, and the foundation had to be torn down and redone. A week later, shortly after the rework project was completed, it was discovered that the foundation of the electric winch also needed to be reworked and reinforced. Not to mention the waste of materials, the construction period was also prolonged.

Why did such accidents happen one after another?

It turned out that by the end of October this year, the civil construction project in Tongchuan Mining Area had only completed 62 percent of the annual plan. Seeing that the weather was getting colder day by day, the leadership developed the idea of ​​rushing to complete the task, relaxed management work, and neglected technical explanations. For example, the workers who prefabricated concrete beams in the No. 1 Construction District were temporarily transferred from the support factory and ordinary workers. They were not very skilled in their work, and the leaders did not explain the construction methods and operating procedures to the workers in detail, so they did the work badly.

There is not much time left this year, and it is good to seize the time to complete as much capital construction work as possible; but this good intention must be based on strict technical organizational work. Otherwise, like the civil construction project in Tongchuan Mining Area, it will result in simply rushing to complete the task, neglecting quality, and causing constant rework, which will ultimately prolong the construction period.

    数量要紧，质量也要紧
    陕西省铜川矿区土木建筑一工区和王家河二号竖井土木建筑工程，从十一月份以来连续发生质量事故。十一月十五日，一工区预制混凝土门窗过梁，一次就坏了十四根；同一天，砌好还不到一天的贮水池也泡塌了。王家河二号竖井电绞车房的墙基垒好近两公尺高的块石的时候，发现绞车房的中心线定偏了，要扒掉墙基重做。一个星期后，刚做完返工工程不久，又发现电绞车基础也要返工加固。浪费材料不算，工期也拉长了。
    为什么会接连发生这样的事故呢？
    原来今年铜川矿区土木建筑工程到十月底只完成年计划的百分之六十二，眼看天气一天天冷起来了，领导上就产生了急于赶任务的思想，放松了管理工作，技术交底也疏忽了。像一工区预制混凝土梁的那些工人，都是临时从支架厂和普通工中抽调来的，工作很不熟练，领导上也没有详细向工人交代施工方法和操作规程，就把活做坏了。
    今年剩下的时间已经不多了，抓紧时间尽可能多地完成基本建设工作量，这是好的；但是这种好的意愿要建立在严密的技术组织工作的基础上。否则，就会像铜川矿区的土木建筑工程一样，产生单纯赶任务，忽视质量而造成不断的返工，最后反而把工期拉长的恶果。
