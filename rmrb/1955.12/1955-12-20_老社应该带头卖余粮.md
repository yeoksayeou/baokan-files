Old Cooperatives Should Take the Lead in Selling Surplus Grain

The members of the Anshan Agricultural Cooperative in Maba Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, had a total grain sales task of 65,000 jin for the entire year. The cooperative originally planned to complete 60 percent of the annual grain sales task after the summer harvest. However, due to weak political and ideological work within the cooperative, many members demanded to keep more grain for themselves and sell less surplus grain after the summer harvest. Some members even threatened the cooperative's cadres with withdrawing from the cooperative. At that time, the management committee of the cooperative yielded to these members' backward thinking. As a result, each person kept an extra month's worth of rations, and they only completed 42.4 percent of the annual grain sales task.

Recently, after the autumn grain unified purchase work began, township cadres and cadres from other old cooperatives criticized the Anshan Agricultural Cooperative's erroneous thinking regarding the grain sales task. The director of the Hele Agricultural Cooperative criticized them at a meeting, saying, "Your cooperative is an old cooperative and should take the lead, but your completion of the grain sales task is the worst in the entire township!" The cadres of the Anshan Agricultural Cooperative resolved to change this disgraceful situation. They inspired the members to criticize the erroneous thinking of only caring about oneself and not the country, and motivated the members to actively sell surplus grain. Now the entire cooperative has sold more than 61,000 jin of surplus grain, and will soon complete the annual grain sales task.

During the autumn grain unified purchase period, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should check the grain sales situation of their members and educate them to actively hand over surplus grain. Cooperatives should be ahead of individual farmers in completing the grain sales task, and old cooperatives should be ahead of new cooperatives and all farmers.

    老社应该带头卖余粮
    广东省曲江县马坝乡鞍山农业合作社的社员今年全年的售粮任务是六万五千斤。合作社本来计划在夏收后要完成全年售粮任务的百分之六十。但是，由于合作社内的政治思想工作薄弱，很多社员在夏收后要求多留口粮少卖余粮，有的社员甚至用退社的话来威胁合作社的干部。当时合作社的管理委员会也就迁就了这些社员的落后思想。结果，这个社每个人多留了一个月的口粮，仅仅完成了全年售粮任务的百分之四十二点四。
    最近秋粮统购工作开始后，乡干部和其他几个老社的干部对于鞍山农业合作社对待售粮任务的错误思想进行了批评。和乐农业合作社主任就曾在一次会议上批评他们说：“你们社是老社，应该起带头作用，可是你们完成售粮任务却是全乡最差的一个社！”鞍山农业合作社的干部决心改变这种不光彩的情况。他们启发社员批判了只顾自己不顾国家的错误思想，并且带动社员踊跃卖余粮。现在全社已经卖余粮六万一千多斤，很快就可以完成全年售粮任务了。
    在秋粮统购期间，各地农业合作社都应该检查一下社员售粮情况，教育社员积极交售余粮。合作社应该在完成售粮任务上走在单干农民的前头，而老社更应该走在新社和所有农民的前头。
