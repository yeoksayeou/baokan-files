    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Soviet Union Produces a New Type of Internal Combustion Locomotive
    The Kharkov Transport Machine Factory in the Soviet Union recently officially produced a new type of "TЭ-Three" internal combustion locomotive. This automated locomotive can travel 100 kilometers per hour. It is equipped with two sets of 2,000-horsepower diesel engines, each of which can operate independently. The locomotive's horsepower is twice that of the existing "TЭ-Two" locomotive, but its weight is reduced by 40 tons, and its fuel consumption is also relatively low. It can haul 4,000-ton freight trains, and the cost of transportation is two-thirds cheaper than that of ordinary steam locomotives.
    This locomotive can operate in hot deserts or in extremely cold climates. The locomotive is equipped with a small boiler, which can ensure that fuel, oil, and water do not freeze when the locomotive stays on cold lines for a long time.
    The Soviet Union Creates Two New Types of Logging Combine
    The Soviet Union has recently created two new types of logging combines, which have greatly improved the work of the Soviet logging industry.
    One of the machines is assembled on a ZIS-151 truck and can handle all operations of timber harvesting, such as felling trees, collecting timber, loading, and transporting. This logging combine only requires four people to manage, and it can fell and transport 30 cubic meters of timber in one work shift. Thus, the average workload per worker is twice that of using old-fashioned machinery.
    Another new type of logging combine was successfully created on the basis of the "KT-Twelve" timber-collecting tractor. This logging combine only requires three people to manage, and each worker can harvest an average of six to seven cubic meters of timber in a work shift, which is much more than the original "KT-Twelve" timber-collecting tractor.
    These two new types of combines can also help solve the important problem of utilizing waste materials. The combines can transport entire felled tree trunks from the forest, so operations such as pruning, peeling, cleaning, and sawing tree trunks can be concentrated on the log yard. Tree branches, treetops, and bark are no longer left in the forest, which can prevent fires in the forest.
    Hungary is Already One of the World's Largest Aluminum Producers
    Hungary has developed into one of the world's largest aluminum-producing countries since liberation. Compared with the years with the highest output before liberation, Hungary's aluminum production in 1954 has increased threefold. Calculated on a per capita basis, Hungary's aluminum production has exceeded that of the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy. At present, the purity of aluminum refined by Hungary's aluminum industry can reach 99.99%, and there are more than 500 kinds of aluminum products produced.
    Hungary's bauxite reserves are the richest in the world, accounting for about 50% of all reserves in Europe. Before World War II, Hungary mined approximately 500,000 tons of bauxite each year. More than 90% of it was exported, and only a small part remained in the country for aluminum smelting. After liberation, the People's Government expanded and rebuilt the old aluminum factories. Among them, the alumina production of a factory in Mosonmagyaróvár has now increased tenfold compared to before liberation.
    Czechoslovakia Successfully Trial-Produces a New Type of Dust-Collecting Pneumatic Drill
    The Ostrava Mining Research Institute in Czechoslovakia recently successfully trial-produced a new type of dust-collecting pneumatic drill. Experiments have proved that this drill can completely absorb rock dust that is harmful to workers' health when drilling rock, eliminating the phenomenon of rock dust flying around, thus solving this aspect of the problem that has not been completely solved in drilling projects in various countries.
    This new type of pneumatic drill can also rotate 200 times more per minute than ordinary pneumatic drills. The middle of the drill is hollow, and there are many small holes on the drill bit. When the drill bit drills rock, the rock dust is sucked into the drill through the small holes of the drill bit, and then sent to a filter through a rubber tube for cleaning.
    Poland Invents Highly Effective Liquid Fire Retardant
    Polish scientists have recently invented a highly effective liquid fire retardant. This fire retardant has been tested in coal mines and has achieved good results. When this liquid fire retardant is poured on flammable coal dust, the flammable coal dust will not catch fire. Wooden pillars in mines are poured with this liquid and have fireproof properties. In the event of a fire, as long as this fire-retardant liquid is poured around the flames, the fire will not spread. Therefore, this fire retardant is of great value to fire prevention and firefighting in coal mines.
    This fire retardant can be manufactured entirely from Polish domestic raw materials, and the cost is very low. Mass production will begin soon.
    Romania Completes a Modern Antibiotics Factory
    One of the largest and most modern antibiotic enterprises in Europe, the Iasi Antibiotics Factory, was completed and put into production in Iasi, Romania on December 11. The factory is equipped with the latest Soviet-made machines and equipment, and most of the production process is automated. It mainly produces penicillin at present, and will gradually start producing other types of antibiotics in the next few years.
    On the day the factory started operations, a celebration meeting attended by several thousand people was held. Kisinevski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the start of the antibiotics factory will play a huge role in protecting the health of the working people in urban and rural areas.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联生产一种新型内燃机车
    苏联哈尔科夫运输机器工厂最近已经正式生产一种新型的“TЭ—三”式内燃机车。这种操作自动化的机车每小时能行走一百公里。它装有两组各为二千马力的柴油机，每组柴油机都可以独立工作。机车的马力比现有的“TЭ—二”式机车的马力大一倍，但是重量反而减轻了四十吨，耗油量也比较小。它能够牵引四千吨重的货车，运货费用要比一般蒸汽机车便宜三分之二。
    这种机车可以在炎热的沙漠里行驶，也可以在严寒的气候中行驶。机车上附装有一个小锅炉，当机车在气候寒冷的线路上停留较久的时候，它可以保证燃油、机油和水不致冻结。
    苏联创制两种新型伐木联合机
    苏联最近创制了两种新型的伐木联合机，这些机器大大改进了苏联伐木工业的工作。
    其中一种机器装配在吉斯—一五一型汽车上，能够担任采伐木材的全部操作，如伐树、集材、装载和运输等。这种伐木联合机只要四个人管理，它在一个工作班里能够伐倒和搬运三十立方公尺的木材。这样，平均每个工人的工作量要比使用旧式机械的工作量多两倍。
    另一种新型的伐木联合机是在“KT—十二”型集材拖拉机的基础上创制成功的。这种伐木联合机只要三个人管理，平均每个工人在一个工作班里能够采伐六、七立方公尺的木材，比原来的“KT—十二”型集材拖拉机要多得多。
    这两种新型联合机还能够帮助解决利用废材的重要问题。联合机可以把整个伐倒的树干从森林里运出来，因此树干的截枝、刨皮、清理、制材等操作，可以集中在楞场上进行。森林中不再遗留树枝、树梢和树皮等，这样就可以防止树林中发生火灾。
    匈牙利已是世界最大产铝国之一
    匈牙利在解放以来已经发展成为世界上最大的产铝国家之一。和解放前产量最多的年代相比，一九五四年匈牙利的铝产量已经增加到三倍。如果按人口平均计算，匈牙利的铝产量已经超过了英国、法国、西德和意大利。目前匈牙利制铝工业提炼出的铝的纯度可以达到百分之九十九点九九，出产的铝制品共有五百多种。
    匈牙利的制铝原料铁矾土的蕴藏量是世界上最丰富的，约占欧洲全部蕴藏量的百分之五十左右。在第二次世界大战以前，匈牙利每年大约开采五十万吨铁矾土。其中有百分之九十以上输出国外，只有很小一部分留在国内炼铝。解放以后，人民政府扩建和改建了旧的制铝工厂。其中在莫松马扎罗瓦的一个工厂氧化铝的产量目前已经增加到解放前的十倍。
    捷试制成功一种新式吸尘风钻
    捷克斯洛伐克的俄斯特拉发采矿研究所，最近试制成功了一种新式吸尘风钻。实验证明：这种风钻在钻凿矿岩的时候，可以完全吸去对工人健康有害的岩尘，免除了岩尘飞扬的现象，从而解决了各国钻凿工程中没有彻底解决的这方面的问题。
    这种新式风钻比普通风钻每分钟还可以多转动二百次。风钻的中间是空的，钻头上有许多小孔，当钻头钻凿岩石的时候，岩尘就被钻头的小孔吸进风钻中，然后由橡皮管送到一个过滤器里滤净。
    波兰发明效力高的液体防火剂
    波兰的科学家最近发明了一种效力很高的液体防火剂。这种防火剂已经在煤矿中试验，获得良好的效果。把这种液体防火剂浇在易燃煤尘上，易燃煤尘就不会着火。矿井中的木支柱浇上这种液体，就具有防火的性能。在万一发生火灾时，只要把这种防火液体浇在火苗周围，火势就不致扩大。因此，这种防火剂对煤矿中的防火和救火工作具有很大的价值。
    这种防火剂可以全部用波兰国产原料制造，成本很低廉。不久即将开始大量生产。
    罗建成一座现代化抗生素工厂
    欧洲最大和最现代化的抗生素企业之一——雅西抗生素工厂，已经在十二月十一日在罗马尼亚的雅西市建成并且投入生产了。这个工厂安装有苏联制造的最新式的机器和设备，生产过程大部分是自动化的。它目前主要是生产青霉素，在今后几年内，将陆续开始生产其他种类的抗生素。
    在工厂开工这一天，举行了有几千人参加的庆祝大会。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员基辛涅夫斯基在会上讲了话。他着重指出：抗生素工厂的开工对保护城乡劳动人民的健康将起巨大的作用。
