Remarkable Achievements in National Agricultural Production This Year
Grain and Cotton Yields Reach Highest Historical Levels

    Based on statistics from various locations, the recent National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture believes that this year's national agricultural production has yielded remarkable achievements, with both grain and cotton production creating the highest annual yields in China's history. This year, the total national grain output reached 363.9 billion jin, exceeding the state plan by 0.8 percent, an increase of 24.8 billion jin compared to 1954, and an increase of 36 billion jin compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952. This year, the total national cotton output reached more than 28.5 million dan (lint cotton, same below), exceeding the state plan by 9 percent, an increase of more than 7.2 million dan compared to 1954, and an increase of more than 2.4 million dan compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952.
    This year, due to the development of the agricultural cooperation movement and the implementation of agricultural technology reforms in various regions, many high-yield units have emerged. This year, the 305,000 mu of double-cropping rice in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, averaged 1,023 jin per mu, becoming a "thousand-jin yield county" for double-cropping rice. Yun'guang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Meiyun Township, Jieyang County, in the same province, also set a national record of 2,020 jin per mu for double-cropping rice. This year, the state-owned "September 3rd" Mechanical Farm had more than 2,400 mu of spring wheat with an average yield as high as more than 400 jin per mu. The Manas River Basin reclamation area of the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region planted more than 80,000 mu of cotton this year, with an average yield of more than 420 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the highest yield ranging from 1,000 jin to more than 1,400 jin. This year, many thousand-jin zones and thousand-jin townships have also emerged in various regions.
    This year, the output of tea and silk also exceeded the state plan. Although hemp and tobacco did not complete the state plan, they generally increased compared to 1954, with yellow jute increasing by nearly 80 percent compared to 1954.

    今年全国农业增产成绩显著
    粮棉产量创历史上最高纪录
    本报讯　农业部最近召开的全国农业工作会议，根据目前各地统计，认为今年全国农业增产成绩显著，粮食和棉花的产量都创造了我国历史上年产量的最高纪录。今年全国粮食总产量达到三千六百三十九亿斤，超过国家计划百分之零点八，比一九五四年增产二百四十八亿斤，比大丰收的一九五二年增产三百六十亿斤。今年全国棉花总产量达到二千八百五十多万担（皮棉，下同），超过国家计划百分之九，比一九五四年增产七百二十多万担，比大丰收的一九五二年增产二百四十多万担。
    今年各地由于农业合作化运动的发展和农业技术改革的推行，出现了许多高额丰产单位。今年广东省潮安县三十万五千多亩双季稻，平均每亩产量一千零二十三斤，成为双季连作水稻“千斤丰产县”。这个省的揭阳县梅云乡云光农业生产合作社，还创造出双季稻每亩产二千零二十斤的全国最高纪录。今年国营“九三”机械农场有二千四百多亩春小麦平均每亩产量高达四百多斤。新疆军区生产建设部队玛纳斯河流域垦区，今年种植的八万多亩棉花，平均每亩产籽棉四百二十多斤，最高的产一千斤到一千四百多斤。今年各地还出现了许多千斤区、千斤乡。
    今年茶叶、蚕丝的产量也都超过国家计划。麻、烟等虽然没有完成国家计划，但是一般都比一九五四年增产，其中黄洋麻比一九五四年增产将近百分之八十。
