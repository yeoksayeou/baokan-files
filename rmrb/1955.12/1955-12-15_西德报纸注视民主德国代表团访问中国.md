Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: West German public opinion is paying close attention to the visit of the German Democratic Republic government delegation to China. The Düsseldorf "Freie Volkszeitung" has been continuously publishing news of the German Democratic Republic government delegation's activities in Beijing on its front page since December 9th. The "Stuttgarter Zeitung" published news on December 12th about Prime Minister Grotewohl's visit to Tsinghua University and attendance at the Beijing People's Welcome Rally. The Munich "Süddeutsche Zeitung" and other newspapers also published these reports.

The "Deutsche Volkszeitung" published an article on December 10th commenting on China's achievements and Sino-German relations. The article stated: "Despite the United States' non-recognition of China and attempts to politically isolate these 600 million people, they cannot prevent China from developing into a major power in Asia in the past six years. Despite the United States' economic blockade and prohibition of Western countries' trade with China, China's national economy has still achieved great successes in industry, agriculture, and trade." The article pointed out that the United States' "policy of strength" is weak and ineffective against China. Asian problems cannot be solved without considering the interests of the great Chinese people. The article stated: "China has special significance for us Germans because this populous country, with its 600 million people, supports the Warsaw Pact."

    西德报纸注视民主德国代表团访问中国
    新华社柏林十四日电　西德舆论十分注意德意志民主共和国政府代表团在中国的访问。杜塞尔多夫“自由人民报”十二月九日起陆续以首页地位刊载德意志民主共和国政府代表团在北京的活动的消息。“斯图加特日报”十二日刊载了格罗提渥总理参观清华大学和出席北京市人民欢迎大会的消息。慕尼黑的“南德意志报”等也都刊载了这些消息。
    “德国人民报”十日发表文章，评论中国的成就和中德关系。文章说：“尽管美国不承认中国并且企图在政治上孤立这六亿人民，但是他们并不能阻止中国在过去六年中发展成为一个亚洲的大国。尽管美国实行经济封锁并且禁止西方国家对中国的贸易，但是中国的国民经济在工农业和贸易方面依然获得了巨大成就。”文章指出：美国的“实力政策”对中国来说是软弱无力的。亚洲的问题如果不顾及伟大的中国人民的利益是不能够解决的。文章说：“中国对于我们德国人具有特殊的意义，因为这个人口众多的国家以它的六亿人民支持着华沙条约。”
