    Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Discusses Budget
    By Li He, our correspondent in Moscow
    The Fourth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace. Soviet representatives from all over the country are bidding farewell to a meaningful 1955 by discussing major national affairs. The year 1955 was marked by a huge increase in the strength of the Soviet Union and its international prestige. In 1955, the Soviet people overfulfilled the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. In 1955, the ties between the Soviet Union and peace-loving people of the world expanded. The session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to discuss the annual national budget, which is usually held in the spring, was held earlier this time. The meeting was also held to hear reports on the results of the visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev to India, Burma, and Afghanistan.
    Soviet Finance Minister Zverev's report on the 1956 Soviet national budget and the implementation of the 1954 Soviet national budget best illustrates the continuous growth of the Soviet state's power and the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. The Soviet Union's revenue in the 1956 budget will reach 591.9 billion rubles, an increase of more than 30 billion rubles compared to the estimated budget revenue in 1955. In the allocation of the estimated expenditure of 568.8 billion rubles, two points are particularly prominent: First, the amount spent on the national economy is 237.2 billion rubles, an increase of approximately 20 billion rubles compared to 1955. In addition, 109.7 billion rubles will be allocated from enterprise funds to this area. This means that the Soviet Union will increase more factories, mines, and power stations in 1956. The projected increase in industrial production is 10.5 percent. The economic power of the Soviet state will achieve further significant growth. Second, the expenditure on the development of culture, science, healthcare, etc. in 1956 will increase by a huge 14.5 billion rubles compared to 1955. This shows the socialist state's meticulous care for the people's lives. On the other hand, the 1956 defense budget will be reduced by approximately 10 billion rubles compared to 1955. This is another practical action by the Soviet Union after deciding to reduce its armed forces by 640,000, illustrating its continuous efforts to promote the easing of the international situation. This is in sharp contrast to the United States' practice of verbally expressing its hope for easing the situation while actually continuing to expand its armaments and create tensions.
    Another point worth mentioning is that 85 percent of the budget revenue comes from socialist enterprises, which is fundamentally different from the financial system of the United States, which places the burden of huge state expenditures on the shoulders of the working people through various forms of taxes to the greatest extent.
    The discussion of the new budget at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union foretells that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will achieve new and great victories in communist construction in 1956. (December 27)

    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论预算
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联第四届最高苏维埃第四次会议在大克里姆林宫举行。来自全国各地的苏维埃代表们以讨论国家大事来送别有意义的一九五五年。一九五五年是以苏联国力和国际威信的巨大高涨为标志的。在一九五五年，苏联人民超额完成了发展国民经济的第五个五年计划。在一九五五年，苏联和世界爱好和平的人民之间的联系扩大了。照例在春天才举行的讨论年度国家预算的苏联最高苏维埃会议，这次提前举行。会议的举行也为了听取布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗的结果的报告。
    苏联财政部长兹维列夫关于一九五六年苏联国家预算和一九五四年苏联国家预算执行情形的报告，最好地说明了苏维埃国家国力的不断增长和苏联的和平政策。苏联在一九五六年预算中收入将达五千九百一十九亿卢布，比一九五五年估计的预算收入增加三百多亿。在预计的支出五千六百八十八亿卢布的分配上，有两点是特别突出的：第一，用在国民经济上的金额为二千三百七十二亿卢布，比一九五五年增加约二百亿。此外还将从企业资金中拨出一千零九十七亿卢布投入这一方面。这就意味着苏联在一九五六年内将增加更多的工厂、矿山、发电站。预计的工业增产是百分之十点五。苏维埃国家的经济威力将获得进一步的巨大增长。第二，一九五六年在发展文化、科学、保健等等方面的费用将比一九五五年增加一百四十五亿卢布之巨。这表明社会主义的国家对人民生活的无微不至的关怀。而另一方面，一九五六年国防预算将比一九五五年减少约一百亿卢布。这是苏联继决定裁军六十四万之后的又一个实际行动，说明它随时都在努力促进国际局势的趋向缓和，这同美国口头上表示希望缓和局势而实际上却继续扩充军备、制造紧张局势的作法形成尖锐对照。
    另外一点值得指出的是，预算收入的百分之八十五是从社会主义企业得来，这和美国的财政制度把国家巨大开支的重担最大部分通过各种捐税形式压到劳动人民肩上的情况根本不同。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议关于新预算的讨论，预示着苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导之下，将在一九五六年取得共产主义建设的新的巨大胜利。（十二月二十七日）
