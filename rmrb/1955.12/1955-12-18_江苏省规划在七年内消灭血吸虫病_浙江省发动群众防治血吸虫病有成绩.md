Jiangsu Province has formulated a plan to eliminate schistosomiasis within seven years. The plan requires that in 1956, on the existing basis, further clarify the situation, prepare the work, strengthen the pilot work, and gain experience, while treating 12% of the patients. In 1957, through comprehensive prevention and control measures, achieve comprehensive control and development, and treat more than 35% of the patients. From 1958 to 1959, treat more than 80% of the patients and basically eliminate schistosomiasis. From 1960 to 1962, consolidate the existing prevention and control results, clear up the remaining disease areas and eliminate dead ends, so as to completely eliminate the disease. The plan puts forward specific requirements for managing water sources, managing manure, eliminating Oncomelania hupensis, the host of schistosomiasis, and treatment.
	Since liberation, Jiangsu Province has established 39 prevention and treatment centers and stations, 4 affiliated hospitals, and 197 prevention and treatment teams to prevent and control schistosomiasis; and combined with agricultural production, united a large number of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to carry out prevention and treatment work. In the past five years, more than 120,000 patients have been treated in the province, and more than 7,400 people have been treated in Songjiang County alone. The Suzhou area has also widely organized social doctors to participate in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. From July to September this year, a total of 4,515 schistosomiasis patients were treated in the entire area, of which 62% were treated by social doctors. During the treatment, various places gradually promoted the protective medical system, and effective experiences such as burying snails with soil and killing eggs with human urine have been obtained in experiments, and the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine such as "Longhu Grass" have been studied.

	Xinhua News Agency. Farmers in various parts of Zhejiang Province used the method of burying soil to eliminate a large number of intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis - Oncomelania hupensis. From October last year to now, farmers in 24 counties and cities across the province have buried snails with soil while building water conservancy projects, with a buried area of more than 720,000 square meters. According to a survey in Nanyan Township, Jiaxing County, the density of Oncomelania hupensis after being buried with soil was reduced by more than 90% compared with before the soil burial. In the work of eliminating Oncomelania hupensis in Zhejiang Province, some places also used methods such as burning with fire and scalding with boiling water.
	The health department of Zhejiang Province has currently established schistosomiasis prevention and treatment stations in 23 cities and counties, and organized 40 prevention and treatment teams; in 23 key townships, prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis has been carried out. Sixteen counties across the province have initially implemented the management of feces in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign and the production increase campaign. The villages in Jiaxing County have strengthened education on water source management and mobilized women not to wash manure tools in the river. The Jiangshan County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Station has improved or newly built nine water wells in places where the masses are willing and have the conditions, so that the local people can avoid drinking river water. While carrying out prevention work, various places have also vigorously carried out treatment work. The Zhejiang Provincial Health Experimental Institute has studied many methods of treating schistosomiasis with traditional Chinese medicine.

    江苏省规划在七年内消灭血吸虫病
    浙江省发动群众防治血吸虫病有成绩
    江苏省卫生厅已订出七年内消灭血吸虫病的规划。规划要求首先在一九五六年内在现有基础上进一步摸清情况，做好准备工作，加强试点工作，取得经验，同时治疗百分之十二的病人。一九五七年通过综合性的防治措施，达到全面控制发展，治疗百分之三十五以上的病人。一九五八到一九五九年，治疗百分之八十以上的病人，做到基本消灭血吸虫病。一九六○到一九六二年巩固已有防治成效，肃清残留病区和消灭死角，做到完全消灭病害。规划中对管理水源、管理粪便、消灭血吸虫寄生宿主钉螺、治疗等工作都提出了具体要求。
    解放以后，江苏省为防治血吸虫病，已经建立三十九个防治所、站，四个附属医院和一百九十七个防治小组；并结合农业生产，团结了大批中西医，展开了防治工作。全省五年来已治疗了十二万多个患病的人，仅松江县就治疗了七千四百多人。苏州专区并广泛组织社会医生参加防治血吸虫病的工作。今年七月到九月，全专区共治疗四千五百十五个血吸虫病人，其中有百分之六十二是由社会医生治疗的。各地在治疗中逐步推行了保护性医疗制度，在实验中已得出土埋钉螺、人尿灭卵等有效经验，并研究了“龙虎草”等中药的治疗效果。

    浙江省各地农民用土埋的方法，消灭了大量的血吸虫中间宿主——钉螺。从去年十月到现在，全省有二十四个县、市，农民在兴修水利的时候，用土埋钉螺，掩埋的面积达七十二万多平方公尺。据嘉兴县南堰乡的调查，经过土埋后出现的钉螺，密度比土埋以前减少百分之九十以上。浙江省在消灭钉螺的工作中，有的地方还采用火烧和用开水烫等办法。
    浙江省卫生部门目前在二十三个市、县成立了血吸虫病防治站，组织了四十个防治小组；在二十三个基点乡内，展开了对血吸虫病的预防和治疗工作。全省有十六个县结合爱国卫生运动和增产运动，初步推行了对粪便的管理工作。嘉兴县各乡加强了关于管理水源的教育，动员妇女不在河内洗粪具。江山县血吸虫病防治站在群众自愿和有条件的地方，改良或新建了九口水井，使当地群众能避免饮用河水。各地在进行预防工作的同时，还大力进行治疗工作，浙江省卫生实验院研究了许多用中药治疗血吸虫病的方法。　（新华社）
