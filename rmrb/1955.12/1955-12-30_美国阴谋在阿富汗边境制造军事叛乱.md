Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 28th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Nahar" exposed a conspiracy by the U.S. ruling clique to create a military rebellion in Afghanistan.

According to "Al-Nahar," the Italian steamship "Anita Liachi" arrived in Beirut last week. Among the passengers was Mohammad Akbar, the secretary of the Afghan Embassy in the United States. Akbar, carrying a diplomatic passport, demanded that all customs formalities be completed as quickly as possible. Customs officials found his urgency suspicious and conducted a search, which revealed that Akbar's eighteen boxes contained more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made rifles and machine guns.

During the interrogation by customs officials, the detained diplomat confessed that he had brought the ammunition from New York and intended to hand it over to Afghan tribes near the Afghan-Pakistani border.

The interrogation also revealed a plan according to which these Afghan tribes, after receiving arms and ammunition, were to stage a rebellion against the current Afghan authorities.

"Al-Nahar" concluded that the U.S. ruling clique is continuing to weave a web of conspiracies against the legitimate government of Afghanistan, with the aim of creating a military coup in Afghanistan. The underlying reason for these U.S. conspiracies is that Afghanistan has refused to join the Baghdad Pact, which endangers its national sovereignty and independence.

    美国阴谋在阿富汗边境制造军事叛乱
    新华社据塔斯社贝鲁特二十八日讯　黎巴嫩“消息报”揭发了美国统治集团企图在阿富汗制造军事叛乱的阴谋。
    据“消息报”报道，意大利汽轮“阿尼塔·里阿奇号”在上星期到达贝鲁特。乘客中有阿富汗驻美国大使馆的秘书穆罕默德·阿克巴尔。阿克巴尔带有外交护照，他要求尽速地办完一切海关手续。海关官员觉得他这样着急是可疑的，于是进行了搜查，结果，发现阿克巴尔的十八只箱子中藏有两万多发美国制造的步枪和机关枪的弹药。
    这位被拘留的外交家在海关官员审讯的过程中供认：这些弹药是他从纽约带来的，他要把这些弹药交给阿富汗和巴基斯坦边境附近的阿富汗部落。
    在审讯过程中还透露了这样一个计划，根据这个计划，这些阿富汗部落在得到军火和弹药以后，必须进行叛乱来反对目前的阿富汗当局。
    “消息报”最后说，美国统治集团在继续布置反对阿富汗合法政府的阴谋的网，目的在于制造阿富汗的军事政变。这些美国阴谋的幕后原因，是因为阿富汗拒绝参加危害本国主权和独立的巴格达条约。
