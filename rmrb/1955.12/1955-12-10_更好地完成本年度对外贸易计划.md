    Better Complete This Year's Foreign Trade Plan
    Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade

    By the end of October, the Ministry of Foreign Trade had completed 90.62 percent of the year's import plan, an increase of 18.81 percent over the same period last year; the export plan had been completed 83.92 percent, an increase of 16.21 percent over the same period last year; the domestic procurement plan had been completed 81.79 percent, an increase of 43.76 percent over the same period last year; the domestic sales plan had been completed 77.1 percent, an increase of 53.47 percent over the same period last year; and the transportation plan had been completed 82 percent, an increase of 34.61 percent over the same period last year. The situation of previous years where the first three quarters were slack and the fourth quarter was tight has been reversed. These achievements are mainly due to the correct implementation of the state's foreign trade policies and guidelines by all staff of the state-owned foreign trade sector under the leadership and support of Party and government departments at all levels, and with the cooperation and assistance of relevant departments.
    However, we must never be blindly optimistic and complacent because of this. It should be pointed out that there are still many problems in the implementation of this year's foreign trade plans. A prominent one is that the completion is not balanced enough in specific countries and commodities. The completion situation varies greatly between companies and regions. To comprehensively complete this year's foreign trade import and export plans, further efforts are still needed. At present, in terms of the domestic procurement plan, the completion of several native products is not good enough. The profit delivery plan is also not being completed well.
    The occurrence of the above situation and shortcomings, although there are certain objective reasons, such as the poor completion of some commodity procurement plans due to reduced production, is mainly due to our insufficient subjective efforts and shortcomings in our work. It should be emphasized that the business operations and management of some state-owned foreign trade enterprises are still quite backward, and they have not yet closely integrated practicing economy, improving business management, and completing planned tasks. As a result, work errors, waste, and losses often occur in the process of implementing the plan. The organization of procurement, import, and processing of certain commodities is still quite weak. In many areas, the procurement organization and processing technology of animal products cannot keep up with the needs of planned task development. Some areas have not relied well on cooperatives and helped cooperatives to organize small merchants and peddlers to carry out procurement. In terms of procurement prices, the regional price differences for several commodities are too large, and there are individual areas with phenomena of suppressing grades and prices. These problems have hindered the completion of this year's foreign trade plans and must be taken seriously and actively solved.
    However, it should also be pointed out that there are many favorable conditions for comprehensively completing this year's foreign trade tasks. This is due to the attention and support of Party and government leading departments at all levels, and the supply of export goods has improved to a considerable extent; the quantity of inventory goods is generally higher than in previous years. This year's national agricultural harvest is abundant, and most export agricultural, sideline, native, and special products have also had better harvests; some native and special products, such as tussah silk, ramie, and fruits, have even reported bumper harvests, especially with the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement, the socialist consciousness of farmers has been greatly improved. These are all conducive to completing the procurement tasks. In terms of the external situation, our country has further improved its integration of supply and demand with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, which facilitates the timely delivery of imported and exported goods. In order to improve future foreign trade work and ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's foreign trade plan, we must make good use of these favorable factors, strengthen the leadership of administrative and business units at all levels, and do a good job in the following business tasks.
    1. Continue to strengthen the inspection of the implementation of the import plan, and conduct regular expediting based on the specific circumstances of different countries and different commodities, in order to discover problems in a timely manner and find solutions. In particular, pay attention to seizing the completion of import plans for certain commodities that have a large relationship with domestic production relations, and ensure that the imported commodities within this year's plan are transported to the country and allocated to various user departments before the end of the year. All state-owned foreign trade specialized companies should conscientiously implement the policy of combining import and export and unified operation for various countries, and ensure the completion of the import and export tasks they undertake.
    2. Organize the timely delivery of exports to the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and strive to complete the export plans to Asian, African, and capitalist countries. For certain commodities that are indeed difficult to complete the plan, appropriate adjustments can be made to specific varieties under the principle of unchanged amounts, and exports should be organized in a timely manner. In order to effectively improve the quality and specifications of export commodities, the warehousing and storage of purchased export commodities should be strengthened to prevent deterioration and damage, and processing should be organized in a timely manner, and processing technology should be improved. For the export of certain foods, relevant departments should be actively advised to pay attention to improving processing and hygiene conditions, and conduct strict inspection and testing. For general commodities, if it is found that they do not meet the export quality specifications and standards, they should be processed and sorted immediately in order to reach the quality specifications and standards stipulated in the contract.
    3. Seize the favorable opportunity of this year's national agricultural harvest to complete this year's procurement plan. This is not only the main key to ensuring the completion of this year's export plan, but also related to the source of export goods for next year. Local foreign trade bureaus and companies should organize inspection teams according to the specific circumstances of different regions and different commodities, and go deep into key production areas or distribution centers to provide specific assistance and supervision and inspection; closely combine with cooperatives and domestic trade companies to jointly do a good job in procurement, and strictly implement agency procurement and purchase agreements and contracts. At the same time, attention should also be paid to correctly implementing the procurement price policy. For certain commodities with unreasonable prices, they should be studied in conjunction with relevant departments, and appropriately adjusted according to certain procedures under the principle of supporting production and maintaining price stability. In procurement, the method of giving preferential prices for superior grades and setting prices according to grades must be resolutely implemented to prevent errors such as suppressing grades and prices or raising grades and prices.
    4. Doing a good job in import and export transportation is an important key to comprehensively completing the foreign trade plan. Before the end of the year, there are still many import and export goods that need to be transported back to the country from abroad and from the interior to the ports. State-owned foreign trade departments must strengthen contact with various transportation departments, closely coordinate plans, and ensure that all import and export commodities are fully guaranteed in terms of transportation time, quantity, and safety. At the same time, attention should be paid to strengthening port transshipment and allocation work, preventing port congestion, and ensuring that all import and export commodities within the plan are transported to the country and loaded onto ships within the year. When implementing the transportation plan, under the premise of not affecting the completion of the import and export plan, transportation mileage should be shortened as much as possible, loading technology should be improved, and transportation tools should be adjusted appropriately to save transportation and miscellaneous expenses.
    5. In order to improve the quality of plan implementation and complete this year's profit delivery plan for state-owned foreign trade, all units should actively mobilize the masses, conscientiously implement the Ministry of Foreign Trade's decision on improving the business management of state-owned foreign trade enterprises, practicing economy, seize all business links, strengthen economic accounting, and continue to conduct detailed accounting, especially for certain commodities that are operating at a loss, and try to avoid losses or minimize losses. At the same time, reduce various expenses, eliminate waste, prevent errors and losses, and improve work efficiency.
    There are still more than twenty days left until the end of the year. All comrades in the foreign trade department, let us mobilize ourselves intensively and strive to comprehensively and victoriously complete the 1955 foreign trade plan and prepare for further improving foreign trade work next year!

    更好地完成本年度对外贸易计划
    对外贸易部副部长  雷任民
    到十月底止，对外贸易部全年进口计划已经完成百分之九十点六二，比去年同期增长百分之十八点八一；出口计划已经完成百分之八十三点九二，比去年同期增长百分之十六点二一；国内收购计划已经完成百分之八十一点七九，比去年同期增长百分之四十三点七六；国内销售计划已经完成百分之七十七点一，比去年同期增长百分之五十三点四七；运输计划已经完成百分之八十二，比去年同期增长百分之三十四点六一。历年前三季度松，第四季度紧的情况扭转了。这些成绩的取得，主要是由于在各级党、政部门的领导和支持以及有关部门的配合协助下，国营对外贸易部门全体工作人员正确执行了国家对外贸易的政策方针。
    但是，我们绝不能因此而盲目乐观和自满。应该指出，在今年对外贸易各项计划的执行中，还存在不少问题，其中比较突出的，就是在具体国别和商品上，完成得还不够平衡，公司之间和地区之间完成的情况也好坏不一，要全面地完成本年度对外贸易进出口计划，还需要作最后的努力。目前，在国内收购计划方面，若干土产品完成得不够好。上缴利润计划完成得也不好。
    上述情况和缺点的产生，虽然有一定的客观原因，如有些商品收购计划完成差是因减产所致。但是主要的还是由于我们主观上努力不够，在工作上还有缺点。应该着重指出的是，有的国营对外贸易企业单位的业务经营管理仍旧相当落后，还没有很好地使厉行节约、改善经营管理同完成计划任务三者密切结合，因而在执行计划的过程中，工作上的差错和浪费、损失等事故经常发生。对某些商品的收购、进货和加工的组织工作还相当薄弱，很多地区畜产品的收购组织和加工技术都还赶不上计划任务发展的需要。有些地区没有很好依靠合作社和帮助合作社组织小商小贩进行收购。在收购价格上，若干商品的地区差价过大，个别地区还有压级压价的现象。这些问题都妨碍了今年对外贸易各项计划的完成，必须引起重视，积极设法加以解决。
    但是，也应该指出，全面完成今年对外贸易各项计划任务，是有许多有利条件的。这就是由于各级党政领导部门的重视和支持，出口货源的供应情况有了相当程度的改善；库存商品数量一般都比往年有所增加。今年全国农产品丰收，大部分出口农、副、土、特产品收成也较好；有些土、特产品如柞蚕、苎麻、水果等还告丰收，特别是随着农业合作化运动的高涨，农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高。这些都是有利于完成收购任务的。就对外情况来说，我国同苏联和各人民民主国家在供需的结合上有了进一步的改善，便于进口和出口货的按期交货。为了改进今后对外贸易工作，保证本年度对外贸易计划的全面完成，我们必须很好掌握和运用这些有利的因素，加强各级行政和业务单位的领导，做好以下几项业务工作。
    一、继续加强对进口计划执行情况的检查，并且分别不同国家和不同商品的情况，定期进行催交，以便及时发现问题，设法解决。特别要注意抓紧完成某些跟国内生产关系较大的商品的进口计划，保证在年底以前把今年计划内的进口商品运到国内拨交各用货部门。各国营对外贸易专业公司应该认真贯彻执行进出口兼营和对各国统一经营的方针，保证完成所担负的进出口任务。
    二、及时组织对苏联和各人民民主国家的出口交货，努力完成对亚非国家和资本主义国家的出口计划。对某些确实难以完成计划的商品，可在金额不变的原则下，对具体品种进行适当调剂，及时组织出口。为了有效地改善出口商品质量规格，对收购的出口商品，应该加强仓储保管工作，防止变质损坏，并且及时组织加工，改进加工技术，对某些食品的出口品应该积极建议有关部门注意改善加工卫生条件，进行严格的检查检验。对一般商品如发现不符出口质量规格标准的，应该即进行加工整理，以求达到合同规定的质量规格标准。
    三、抓紧今年全国农产品丰收的有利时机，完成今年收购计划。这不仅是保证完成今年出口计划的主要关键，而且关系到明年的出口货源问题。各地对外贸易局和公司应该根据不同地区和不同商品的具体情况，分别组织检查小组，深入重点产区或集散地，进行具体协助和督促检查；密切同合作社和国内贸易公司结合，共同做好收购工作，严格执行代购进货协议和合同。同时还应该注意正确执行收购价格政策，对某些价格不合理的商品，应该会同有关部门研究，在扶植生产和保持物价稳定的原则下，根据一定手续加以适当调整。在收购中必须坚决执行优级优价、分等论价的办法，防止压级压价或提级提价等错误作法。
    四、做好进出口运输工作是全面完成对外贸易计划的一个重要关键。年前还有很多进出口货物需要从国外运回国内和从内地运到口岸。国营对外贸易部门必须加强跟各交通运输部门的联系，密切衔接计划，使所有进出口商品在运输时间、数量、安全等方面都有充分保证。同时应该注意加强口岸换装接运和拨交工作，防止口岸堵塞，保证所有计划内的进出口商品在年内运到国内和装船运出。在执行运输计划的时候，还应该在不影响进出口计划完成的前提下，尽可能缩短运输里程，改善装载技术，适当调整运输工具，以节约运杂费用。
    五、为了提高计划执行的质量，并且完成本年度国营对外贸易上缴利润计划，各单位应该积极发动群众，切实贯彻执行对外贸易部关于改善国营对外贸易企业经营管理厉行节约的决定，抓住各个业务环节，加强经济核算，特别对某些经营亏损的商品，应继续进行详细核算，尽量做到不赔或少赔。同时降低各项费用，消灭浪费，防止差错损失，提高工作效率。
    现在距年终还有二十多天。对外贸易部门全体工作同志们，紧张地动员起来，为全面地胜利地完成一九五五年对外贸易计划、为明年进一步提高对外贸易工作做好准备而努力！
