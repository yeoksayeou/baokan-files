Jiangxi Province will build more than thirty fertilizer plants next year. These include twenty-six granular fertilizer plants, four lime plants, and three bone meal plants.

　　These planned factories will be distributed across six special (administrative) districts and thirty-eight counties (cities) throughout the province. Based on the designed capacity of the twenty-six granular fertilizer plants, they can produce 25,227 tons of granular fertilizer annually. According to statistics on the effectiveness of granular fertilizer already used, each ton of granular fertilizer applied can increase grain production by at least half a ton compared to other fertilizers.
