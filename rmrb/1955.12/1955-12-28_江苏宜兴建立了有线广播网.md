    Yixing, Jiangsu Establishes Wired Broadcasting Network
    Yixing County in Jiangsu Province has established a county-wide wired broadcasting network. One hundred and seventy-five loudspeakers have been installed in farms and one hundred and thirty-eight agricultural cooperatives in six counties and districts, with a line length of approximately 972 li.
    Every day when the broadcast starts, the broadcast receivers in various villages are crowded with people. In Zhangze Township, more than 8,000 farmers regularly listen to the broadcast, and at most there are 14,000 people.
    In accordance with the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the Yixing County Rural Wired Broadcasting Station has made a comprehensive plan for the development of the rural broadcasting network. By 1956, the number of loudspeakers in the rural areas of the county will be increased to 2,000; by 1957, the number will be increased to 3,500, with loudspeakers in every natural village on average.

    江苏宜兴建立了有线广播网
    江苏省宜兴县已经建立了全县性的有线广播网，在六个县、区的农场和一百三十八个农业合作社里，装上了一百七十五个喇叭，线路长约九百七十二里。
    每天一到广播时间，各乡广播器前挤满人群。张泽乡经常听广播的农民有八千人以上，最多的时候有一万四千人。
    根据农业合作化运动迅速发展的形势，宜兴县农村有线广播站已经作出了发展农村广播网的全面规划。到一九五六年，全县农村要发展到二千个喇叭；一九五七年发展到三千五百个喇叭，平均每个自然村都有喇叭。  （本报驻南京记者）
