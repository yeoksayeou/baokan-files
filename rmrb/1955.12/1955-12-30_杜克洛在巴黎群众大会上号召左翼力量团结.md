Xinhua News Agency, Paris: The French election campaign has entered its final stage, and various political parties are making every effort to carry out intense campaign activities. At this time, the Paris Exhibition Palace held the largest mass meeting since the start of the election campaign on the evening of December 27th. One of the leaders of the "Republican Front," Mendès-France, and the Secretary of the French Communist Party, Duclos, publicly debated at the meeting.

Mendès-France originally wanted to turn this meeting into a campaign publicity event for himself, but he miscalculated miserably.

The first to speak at the meeting was Mendès-France. Despite the loud speakers, his voice was repeatedly drowned out by the shouts from the masses attending the meeting demanding the establishment of a "People's Front."

Then Duclos spoke. Thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue.

Duclos first emphasized that the aim of the Communist Party is to end the current reactionary policies and strive to implement new policies that meet the people's aspirations. He reminded the audience that Mendès-France bears direct responsibility for the Paris Agreements, which violate the national interests of France and rearm West Germany.

Duclos pointed out that the current French foreign policy is one of "surrender to West Germany, which has already begun to arm," a policy of "subservience to the United States, increased military spending, and refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union." He emphasized that Mendès-France's position on the Algerian issue is not much different from that of the extreme right-wing parties. Mendès-France has vigorously opposed improving the material conditions of the working masses and promoting church interference in education in the National Assembly.

Duclos then said: The majority of the French people hope to implement a left-wing policy, that is, a policy of national independence and peace, freedom, and social progress. If the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party agree to form an electoral alliance with the Communist Party, this alliance could win all the parliamentary seats in forty provinces across the country.

At this time, the audience shouted: "People's Front! People's Front!"

Duclos said: Although the leaders of the "Republican Front" have divided the left-wing forces, it is still entirely possible to form a left-wing government after the elections on January 2nd. He reiterated the Communist Party's proposal to establish the necessary unity on the issue of changing French policy, and emphasized that it is possible to reach an agreement between Communists, Socialists, and other left-wing elements in order to establish a government after the election that fully meets the aspirations of the French people.

The audience then shouted in unison: "Unity!" "People's Front!"

    杜克洛在巴黎群众大会上号召左翼力量团结
    据新华社讯　巴黎消息：法国竞选运动已经进入最后阶段，各政党正在全力进行紧张的竞选活动。在这个时候，巴黎展览宫在十二月二十七日晚上举行了竞选运动开展以来规模最大的一次群众大会，“共和阵线”的领袖之一孟戴斯—弗朗斯和法国共产党书记杜克洛在会上公开答辩。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯原想把这次大会变成自己的竞选宣传场合，但是他狼狈地失算了。
    第一个在大会上演讲的是孟戴斯—弗朗斯。尽管扩音器的声音很响，他的声音还是一再被参加大会的群众要求建立“人民阵线”的呼声压了下去。
    接着杜克洛讲话。全场响起暴风雨般的掌声。
    杜克洛首先着重指出，共产党的目的是结束现行的反动政策，争取执行符合人民愿望的新政策。他提醒说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯对违反法国民族利益、武装西德的巴黎协定负有直接责任。
    杜克洛指出法国现行外交政策是“向已经开始武装的西德投降的”政策，“屈从美国、增加军费、拒绝同苏联谈判的”政策。他着重指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯在阿尔及利亚问题上的立场同极右翼党派的立场没有多大差别，孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾经在国民议会中大力反对改善劳动群众的物质状况和助长教会对教育事业的干涉。
    杜克洛接着说：大多数法国人民希望执行左的政策，也就是民族独立和和平、自由和社会进步的政策。如果社会党和激进社会党的领导者同意和共产党结成选举联盟，这个联盟就能在全国四十个省中获得全部议员席位。
    这个时候，听众高呼：“人民阵线！人民阵线！”
    杜克洛说：虽然“共和阵线”的领导者使得左翼力量分裂，但是仍然有一切可能在一月二日的选举之后组成一个左翼的政府。他再度提出了共产党关于在改变法国政策的问题上建立必要的团结的建议，并且强调指出，有可能在共产党员、社会党员和其他左翼分子之间取得协议，以便在选举后建立一个完全符合法国人民愿望的政府。
    听众这时又齐声高呼：“团结！”“人民阵线！”
