Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 30th: The "Rose al-Yūsuf" weekly published a statement by Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Gamal Salem during a meeting with the weekly's reporter regarding Egypt's foreign trade policy.

    Salem emphasized that the typical approach of Middle Eastern countries in recent years has been to unilaterally favor Western markets, which is not beneficial for Arab countries. Salem said: "This will only lead to the consolidation of the position of Western capital and its attempt to establish dominance over Middle Eastern countries, requiring them to serve Western interests. We are forced to seek new markets where we are regarded as an independent and sovereign nation... We have found this attitude in Eastern Europe. When it comes to trade with other countries, we primarily consider Egypt's interests. We believe that trade must be free and in the public interest. It should be based on respect for our sovereignty and independence."

    Salem ridiculed the Western countries' claims that developing Egypt's economic relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is fraught with so-called "dangers" for Egypt. He said: "I don't think that trading with Russia will make us communists. Moreover, I don't think the communists want to do that."

    埃及副总理谈埃及对外贸易政策
    新华社十一月三十日讯　塔斯社开罗讯：“鲁兹·优素福”周刊登载了埃及副总理加麦尔·萨勒姆在接见这个周刊的记者的时候发表的关于埃及对外贸易政策的谈话。
    萨勒姆强调指出，近年来中东国家典型的作法是片面倾向西方市场，这对于阿拉伯国家是没有好处的。萨勒姆说：“这只会导致西方资本的地位的巩固，并且使它企图建立对中东国家的统治，要它们为西方的利益服务。我们被迫去寻求新的市场，在那里我们被看作一个独立的主权国家……。我们已经在东欧发现了这种态度。在同其他国家进行贸易的问题上，我们首先以埃及的利益为准绳。我们认为贸易必须是自由的和符合公众利益的。它应当建立在尊重我们的主权和独立的基础上面。”
    萨勒姆嘲笑西方国家那种说发展埃及同苏联和人民民主国家的经济关系对埃及来说，充满着所谓“危险”的言论。他说：“我不认为我们同俄国进行贸易将使我们赤化。而且，我不认为共产党想这样做。”
