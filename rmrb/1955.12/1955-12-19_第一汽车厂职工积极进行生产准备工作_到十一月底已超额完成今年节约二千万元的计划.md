Changchun, December 15th (Our Newspaper) - Employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are actively engaged in production preparation work, striving to produce automobiles as soon as possible.

　　In the eight basic production workshops that have been completed, workers are adjusting production. During the production adjustment process, employees will gradually understand the performance of the machines, master new technologies and modern production management methods, and trial-produce qualified parts in accordance with process requirements. The chassis workshop, which adjusted production earlier, is trial-producing parts for the rear axle of the car. The employees of this workshop have also launched a labor competition to strive for no accidents during production adjustment. Three months ago, it took adjuster Liu Yaozhong half a day to manufacture a qualified part. After hard work, it now only takes eight minutes to make one part. On December 6th, Liu Yaozhong also set a record of one hundred accident-free machine runs.

　　The eight workshops and two engineering sections of the auxiliary plant serving basic production have now produced more than 6,000 kinds of precision tools, which have strongly helped the production preparation work. Various material preparation work before the official start of production is also actively underway.

Changchun, December 15th (Our Newspaper) - By the end of November, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had exceeded the annual savings target of 20 million yuan.

　　In accordance with the spirit of practicing comprehensive economy, the First Automobile Factory reduced 15 non-productive construction projects this year, saving a total of more than 7.3 million yuan. At the same time, after the appraisal and guidance of Soviet experts, 115 industrial construction designs were modified without affecting production, saving more than 3.99 million yuan. The foundry workshop modified 21 construction projects. For example, in civil engineering construction, the square wood floor was changed to a concrete floor, and the electric steel window switch was changed to a manual steel window switch, which saved a lot of funds. In terms of installation engineering, reducing the supports for compressed air pipelines and replacing I-beams with shaped steel saved a total of more than 340,000 yuan. The employees of some workshops that are adjusting production are working hard to reduce material consumption and reduce waste products. Employees of the thermal power plant are now not only overfulfilling the power generation and heating plans, but also reducing coal consumption rates. The scrap rate of the First Tool Workshop has been reduced from 1.22% to 0.81%.

    第一汽车厂职工积极进行生产准备工作
    到十一月底已超额完成今年节约二千万元的计划
    本报长春十五日电  第一汽车制造厂职工正在积极进行生产准备工作，争取早日出产汽车。
    在已经落成的八个基本生产车间里，工人们正在调整生产。在调整生产的过程中，职工们将逐步摸清机器的性能，掌握新技术和现代生产管理方法，并且要按照工艺的要求试制出合格的零件。调整生产较早的底盘车间，正在试制汽车后桥部分的零件。这个车间的职工还展开了劳动竞赛，争取在调整生产中不出事故。调整工刘耀中在三个月以前，制造一个合乎规格的零件需要半天时间，经过努力钻研，现在制一个零件只要用八分钟就可以了。十二月六日，刘耀中还创造了百台次无事故的纪录。
    为基本生产服务的辅助工场的八个车间和两个工部现在已经生产了六千多种精密工具，有力地帮助了生产准备工作的进行。正式开工生产前的各项物资准备工作也在积极进行中。
    本报长春十五日电　第一汽车制造厂到十一月底已经超额完成了全年节约二千万元的节约指标。
    根据厉行全面节约的精神，第一汽车厂今年削减了十五项非生产性工程项目，共计节省了七百三十多万元。同时，经过苏联专家的鉴定和指导，在不影响生产的原则下，修改了一百一十五项工业建设的设计，节省了三百九十九万多元。铸工车间修改了二十一个建设项目，例如在土木建筑工程方面，把方木地板改为混凝土地板，把电动钢窗开关器改为手动钢窗开关器，都节省了不少资金；在安装工程方面，减少压缩空气管道的支架，用型钢代替工字钢，共计节省资金三十四万多元。正在调整生产的一些车间的职工，努力降低材料消耗，减少废品。热电站职工现在不但超额完成了发电和供热的计划，还降低了煤耗率。工具第一车间的废品率由百分之一点二二降低到百分之零点八一。
