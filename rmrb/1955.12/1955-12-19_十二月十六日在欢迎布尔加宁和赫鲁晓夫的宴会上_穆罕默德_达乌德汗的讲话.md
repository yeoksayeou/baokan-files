Marshal Bulganin, Mr. Khrushchev, Ladies and Gentlemen!

On behalf of the people and government of Afghanistan, I sincerely welcome you, Mr. Khrushchev, and your esteemed colleagues. I am delighted on this auspicious day to express, on behalf of the Afghan people and their government, our thanks and heartfelt gratitude to you for accepting the invitation to visit our country.

This is one of the most memorable days in the friendly relations between Afghanistan and the great Soviet Union, and this day will forever be recorded in the annals of friendly relations between the two countries.

Afghanistan has not forgotten and will never forget that the first country to cheer for Afghanistan's freedom and independence was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the first country to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and lay the foundation for international friendship after the October Revolution was Afghanistan.

From that time until now, the relations between these two free countries have been based on mutual trust, good neighborliness, sincere friendship, goodwill, and love of peace. Time and various international developments have not shaken this relationship.

The social life of the two countries is based on different principles, and their friendship is a vivid example of how countries with different government systems can coexist as long as they have friendly relations with each other. Cooperation between the two countries has promoted the development and prosperity of both countries.

The freedom-loving Afghan people have always admired the achievements of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the past thirty-eight years. Today, it is worth noting the efforts made by your country to safeguard world peace, and the energy you, Mr. Bulganin, and your esteemed comrades, especially Mr. Khrushchev, have put into your visits to ensure understanding between the peoples of all countries.

Our respected guests have arrived in our ancient mountainous capital after extensively visiting the vast territory of India. Unfortunately, cold winter winds are blowing now, and all the charm of our country's natural scenery has disappeared in this season. However, the love and sincere welcome of the Afghan people will somewhat compensate for the frost and the desolation of the natural scenery. Our friends will not feel constrained in the home of their sincere friends in this country in the heart of Asia, where the freedom-loving people of all ethnic groups regard freedom as their greatest possession and wealth.

The Afghan people have no other purpose than freedom and happiness, and they are very eager for world peace. They believe that world peace is the greatest guarantee of the freedom and development of their motherland. From this point of view, Afghanistan has consistently followed a policy of neutrality for many years, and it has always been willing to extend a friendly hand to all friendly countries and neighboring countries, and to cooperate with them for the happiness and prosperity of its own country.

Afghanistan is convinced that its policy not only conforms to its own interests, but also to the interests of world peace, and to the interests of its neighbors and friends. Therefore, it is hoped that this policy will also be approved by every peace-loving country.

On every occasion and at all international conferences, Afghanistan has consistently defended the concept of friendly coexistence and freedom of the peoples of all countries, as well as the right of self-determination of any country. Afghanistan has shown not only in words, but also in deeds, that it believes that respecting the equality and independence of all countries is the only way to guarantee world peace.

Mr. Bulganin, Mr. Khrushchev, Ladies and Gentlemen!

I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Afghan government and people, to express my happiness and satisfaction with some of the measures taken in recent years to expand economic and commercial relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.

I hope that this economic cooperation will lay the foundation for the further development of economic cooperation in the future, so as to further consolidate the friendly and sincere relations between the two countries.

The Afghan government has no other purpose than to promote material and cultural progress, develop the country's natural resources, and improve the living standards of its people. For this purpose, Afghanistan is now gratefully accepting and will continue to gratefully accept the assistance of friendly and more developed countries, provided that such assistance has no attached political conditions.

Mr. Bulganin, Mr. Khrushchev, Esteemed Friends!

Finally, please allow me, on behalf of the Afghan government and people, to express my best and sincere wishes to our respected guests, to the great people and government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and to wish good health and happiness to the great Chairman of the Soviet Union, the famous defender of the cause of the Soviet Union, Marshal Voroshilov, and our respected guests, and to express this wish: to strengthen the friendly relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union and to consolidate world peace - this is our common, great and ultimate goal.

    十二月十六日在欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的宴会上
    穆罕默德·达乌德汗的讲话布尔加宁元帅阁下，赫鲁晓夫先生阁下，各位先生！
    我代表阿富汗人民和政府真诚地欢迎阁下，赫鲁晓夫先生和你们的可敬的同事们，我很高兴地在这个可喜的日子，代表阿富汗人民和他们的政府对你们接受邀请来我国访问表示谢意和衷心的感激。
    这是阿富汗和伟大的苏联之间的友好关系中的最可纪念的日子之一，这个日子将永远记载在两国友好关系的史册里面。
    阿富汗没有忘记而且也永远不会忘记：第一个欢呼阿富汗获得自由和独立的国家是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，在十月革命后第一个同苏联建立外交关系和奠定国际友好基础的国家是阿富汗。
    自从那个时候起一直到现在，这两个自由国家之间的关系是建立在互相信任、睦邻、真诚友谊、善意和热爱和平的基础上的。时间和各种国际发展毫没有动摇这种关系。
    两国的社会生活是建立在不同的原则上面的，它们的友谊是具有不同政府制度的国家只要互相之间有友好关系就可以共处的生动的例子。两国之间的合作促进了两国的发展和繁荣。
    爱好自由的阿富汗人民一向钦慕苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟在过去三十八年中所取得的成就。今天值得指出的，还有你们的国家在保障世界和平方面所作出的努力，以及您，布尔加宁先生，和您的可敬的同志们，特别是赫鲁晓夫先生，在你们为了保证各国人民之间的谅解而进行的访问过程中所付出的精力。
    我们的尊敬的客人们在广泛地访问了印度的广大的领土以后，到达我们古老的山地首都。遗憾得很，现在正在刮着寒冷的冬风，在这个季节中，我国天然景色的一切魅力都消失了。但是，阿富汗人民的热爱和诚挚的欢迎将多少可以弥补冬霜和自然景色萧瑟的缺憾。我们的朋友们在亚洲心脏的这个国家中他们真诚的朋友家里，将不会感到拘束，这个国家中的爱好自由的各族人民把自由看作是他们最大的财产和财富。
    阿富汗人民除了自由和幸福以外别无其他目的，他们非常渴望世界和平。他们认为世界安宁是他们祖国的自由和发展的最大的保障。从这一点出发，阿富汗多年来到现在一直遵循着中立政策，它始终愿意对一切友好的国家和毗邻的国家伸出友好的手，并且为了自己国家的幸福和繁荣同它们进行合作。
    阿富汗深信，它的政策不仅符合它自己的利益，而且也符合世界和平的利益，符合它的邻国和朋友的利益。因此，希望这种政策也获得每一个爱好和平的国家的赞成。
    在每一个场合，在一切国际会议上，阿富汗一贯维护世界各国人民友好相处和自由的观念以及任何国家的自决权利。阿富汗不仅在言论上，而且在行动上表明，自己认为尊重各国的平等和独立，是保障世界和平的唯一办法。
    布尔加宁先生阁下，赫鲁晓夫先生阁下，可敬的先生们！
    我借这个机会，代表阿富汗政府和人民，对于最近几年来为了扩大阿富汗和苏联之间的经济和商业关系而采取的一些措施，表示高兴和满意。
    我希望，这种经济合作将奠定经济合作的今后进一步发展的基础，从而使两国之间的友好而诚挚的关系更加巩固。
    阿富汗政府除了促进物质和文化进步、开发本国的天然富源和提高本国人民的生活水平以外，没有其他目的。为了这个目的，阿富汗现在很感激地接受并且将来还要很感激地接受友好的和更发达的国家的援助，如果这种援助没有任何附带的政治条件的话。
    布尔加宁先生阁下，赫鲁晓夫先生阁下，可敬的朋友们！
    最后请允许我代表阿富汗政府和人民向我们的可敬的客人们，向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大人民和苏联政府表示最好的诚恳的祝愿，并且祝苏联的伟大的主席、苏联的事业的著名捍卫者伏罗希洛夫元帅以及我们尊敬的客人们健康和幸福，并且表示这种愿望：加强阿富汗和苏联之间的友好关系和巩固世界和平——这是我们共同的，伟大的和最后的目标。
