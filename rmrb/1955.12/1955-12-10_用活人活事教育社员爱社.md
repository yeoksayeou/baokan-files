When harvesting peanuts in October, Pu Shifu, the director of the Yongxing Agricultural Cooperative in the Yanhe Township of Yanjin County, Yunnan, and the cooperative members were eating peanuts indiscriminately. They ate while harvesting, ate during breaks, ate while walking, and ate when they got home. Li Siyun's wife didn't eat any regular meals for a whole day because she ate too many peanuts, turning her lips black. The members participating in digging peanuts ate approximately eighty or so catties of peanuts in one day. Some members were very dissatisfied with this phenomenon. The cooperative management committee immediately convened a members' meeting, conducted criticism and self-criticism targeting this matter, educated members to cherish public property, and particularly commended cooperative member Lei Tianshun, who loved and protected the cooperative's property, and criticized members who did not care about the cooperative's interests. Everyone also engaged in mutual criticism. Chen Zongyou exposed Zhu Zixiu, saying: "It's not enough that he eats while digging, he also secretly takes them home." Director Pu Shifu, cooperative member Zhu Zixiu, and others all made self-criticisms, admitting their selfish and self-interested thoughts and behaviors that damaged the cooperative's interests, and expressed their firm determination to learn from Lei Tianshun.

The Yongxing Agricultural Cooperative's method of educating members to cherish public property by using real people and real events promptly resolved the problem and also improved the members' understanding.

    用活人活事教育社员爱社
    十月里收花生的时候，云南盐津县?头乡永兴农业合作社社长蒲世富和社员都乱吃花生。他们一边收，一边吃；休息的时候吃，走路吃，回家也吃。社员李思云的妻子因吃花生太多了，一天没有吃饭，把嘴皮都吃乌了。参加挖花生的社员，在一天里吃了大约八十多斤花生。一部分社员对这种现象很不满意。社管理委员会当即召开了社员大会，针对这件事情开展了批评和自我批评，教育社员爱护公共财产，着重表扬了爱护社内财产的社员雷天顺，批评了不关心社内利益的社员。大家还进行了互相批评。陈宗友揭发朱子秀说：“他一边挖一边吃还不算，还偷偷的往家拿。”社长蒲世富，社员朱子秀等都作了自我检讨，承认了损害社内利益的自私自利思想和行为，表示坚决要向雷天顺学习。
    永兴农业合作社这种用活人活事教育社员爱护公共财产的办法，及时解决了问题，也提高了社员的认识。
