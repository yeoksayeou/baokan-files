This Newspaper, Anshan, December 23rd: In order to accelerate China's socialist industrial construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has decided to complete the total output value plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule in 1956.

According to this new plan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel production in 1956 will increase by 109 percent compared to this year's planned output, iron production will increase by 34.5 percent compared to this year's planned output, and steel product output will increase by 74 percent compared to this year's planned output.

In order to realize this plan, the steelmaking plant has decided to further promote advanced experiences such as rapid steelmaking, new furnace methods, and mass maintenance of furnace bodies to shorten smelting time and increase effective operating rates. The ironmaking plant has decided to universally promote advanced Soviet experiences such as steam blowing, self-fluxing sintered ore, and high-pressure furnace top operation to increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and increase iron production. The steel rolling system is preparing to vigorously promote rapid steel rolling, expand and extend the finishing section, shorten maintenance time, and reduce accidents to increase production.

Another important link in realizing this great task is that Anshan's various capital construction projects must also be accelerated. At present, various construction units have initially formulated plans to ensure early and on-schedule completion. For example, the No. 9 blast furnace was originally planned to be completed in October 1956, but now it has been decided to put it into production in July 1956.

In order to exploit the potential of enterprise equipment as much as possible, the equipment of several factories and mines will also be adjusted accordingly next year. The steelmaking plant will add a 100-ton crane next year. The large steel rolling mill will add a soaking pit to achieve equipment balance.

Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has arranged the production tasks for each factory and mine in January 1956 according to the new plan. All employees are actively tapping potential and trying to ensure the realization of this plan. Blast Furnace No. 7 of the Ironmaking Plant has been producing according to the new quota for next year since December 20. The new quota enables this blast furnace to produce 143 tons more pig iron for the country every day.

This Newspaper, Shenyang, December 23rd: Some factories in Shenyang have recently proposed plans to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan one year or more ahead of schedule.

The rebuilt Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory was originally planned to reach its design capacity in 1957. Through the efforts of the employees, this year's output and variety have already reached the design requirements ahead of schedule. Now, this factory has decided to strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan before October 1956.

The draft plan for 1956 recently compiled by the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory aims to complete the production tasks for 1957 in advance within 1956. Now, this factory has started to formulate a production technology organization measures plan for 1956, and held an employee meeting on December 20 to mobilize all employees to strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan in four years.

In December, the Shenyang Fan Factory conducted a survey and determination based on existing quotas and advanced quotas, and found that the production potential is still very large. For example, the processing workshop found that planers, boring machines, and other equipment were unbalanced during the survey. If they are adjusted and transformed, the workshop's production capacity can be increased by 20 percent. After this survey, the Shenyang Fan Factory revised its output value plan for 1956. The output value stipulated in the new plan increased by 20 percent compared to the original plan. This factory also plans to mobilize all employees to take a series of technical organization measures in the near future to strive to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan in three years and eleven and a half months, and to overfulfill the trial production plan of seven new products in 1956 to ensure the needs of mining, power plants, and smelting departments.

    鞍钢决定四年完成五年总产值计划
    沈阳部分工厂计划提前一年完成五年计划
    本报鞍山二十三日电　为了加速我国社会主义工业建设，鞍山钢铁公司决定在一九五六年，提前一年完成第一个五年计划规定的总产值计划。
    按照这个新计划，一九五六年鞍山钢铁公司钢的产量要比今年的计划产量增加百分之一百零九，铁的产量要比今年的计划产量增加百分之三十四点五，钢材产量要比今年的计划产量增加百分之七十四。
    为了实现这一计划，炼钢厂已经决定要进一步推广快速炼钢、新炼炉法和群众性维护炉体等先进经验，以缩短熔炼时间，提高有效作业率。炼铁厂决定普遍推广蒸气鼓风、自熔性烧结矿、高压炉顶操作等苏联先进经验，以提高高炉利用系数，增加铁的产量。轧钢系统准备大力推行快速轧钢，扩大和延长精整工段，缩短检修时间，减少事故，以增加生产。
    实现这一巨大任务的另一重要环节，是鞍山各基本建设工程也必须加速进行。现在，各个工程单位已经初步制定出保证提前和按期完工的计划。例如，九号高炉原计划在一九五六年十月建成，现在决定提前到一九五六年七月投入生产。
    为了尽一切可能发挥企业设备的潜力，若干厂矿的设备也要在明年作相应的调整。炼钢厂在明年要增加一台百吨吊车。大型轧钢厂要添设一座均热炉，以达到设备的平衡。
    目前，鞍山钢铁公司已经按照新的计划排定了各个厂矿一九五六年一月份的生产任务。全体职工正在积极挖掘潜力，设法保证实现这一计划。炼铁厂的七号高炉从十二月二十日开始，已经按照明年新的定额进行生产。新定额使这座高炉每天能为国家多生产一百四十三吨生铁。
    本报沈阳二十三日电　沈阳市部分工厂最近提出计划，要提前一年或一年以上完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。
    改建的沈阳风动工具厂原计划要在一九五七年才能达到设计能力，经过职工的努力，今年的产量和品种都已经提前达到了设计要求。现在，这个厂决定争取在一九五六年十月以前完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。
    沈阳低压开关厂最近编制的一九五六年的计划草案，要在一九五六年内提前完成一九五七年的生产任务。现在，这个厂已经着手制定一九五六年的生产技术组织措施计划，并在十二月二十日召开了职工大会，动员全体职工争取在四年内完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。
    沈阳扇风机厂在十二月份根据现有定额和先进定额进行了一次查定，发现生产潜力还很大。例如加工车间在查定中发现刨床、镗床等设备不平衡，如果加以调整和改造，车间的生产能力就可以提高百分之二十。经过这次查定，沈阳扇风机厂重新修订了一九五六年的产值计划。新计划规定的产值比原计划增加百分之二十。这个厂还准备在最近发动全体职工采取一系列的技术组织措施，争取在三年零十一个半月内完成第一个五年计划规定的任务，同时要在一九五六年超额完成七种新产品的试制计划，以保证矿山、发电站、冶炼部门的需要。
