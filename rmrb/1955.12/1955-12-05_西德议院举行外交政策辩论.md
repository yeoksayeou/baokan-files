Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 3rd -- West German Foreign Minister von Brentano delivered a government statement in the West German Federal Parliament on the Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 1st. He pointed out that the Western countries' position at the Geneva conference was completely consistent with the position of the West German government.

Brentano hinted that the West German government intends to continue pursuing the policy of participating in the Western military bloc on the basis of the Paris Accords. At the end of his speech, which was full of fierce attacks on the government of the German Democratic Republic, Brentano spoke of the issue of "technical ties" with the German Democratic Republic. Brentano repeated that this did not imply recognition of the German Democratic Republic.

The West German Federal Parliament held a foreign policy debate on the government statement on the 2nd. During the debate, the chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, accused the Federal Government of effectively abandoning an independent policy on the issue of German reunification.

Ollenhauer said: Whether it is the issue of German reunification or European security, it will not be possible to resolve them in the future if both parts of Germany are unwilling to leave the military alliances and if a unified Germany is not included in a collective security system, taking into account the obligations necessary to safeguard its own security and the security of its partners.

Ollenhauer said that the German Social Democratic Party's conclusion from the results of the Geneva conference is: "Now is the time for the Germans themselves to make special efforts to achieve as much progress as possible in the negotiations on the issue of reunification." At the same time, he criticized the Soviet Union's position on the German Democratic Republic issue. His speech clearly showed that the Social Democratic Party's demand for establishing "technical ties" with the German Democratic Republic had nothing in common with achieving genuine mutual understanding between Germans. Ollenhauer particularly opposed the establishment of an all-German committee. Finally, Ollenhauer warned against hastily implementing the Paris Accords, which stipulate the arming of West Germany.

In a brief speech, West German Chancellor Adenauer denied that the German Federal Republic acted on the basis of a "policy of strength," but he also said that in dealing with the Soviet Union, a "policy of weakness" was more dangerous than a "policy of strength."

After the debate, the ruling coalition in the Federal Parliament rejected a motion put forward by the Social Democratic Party, which called for the restoration of German unity on the condition that a unified Germany refuse to join military blocs and participate in a collective security system. The Federal Parliament passed a resolution put forward by the government coalition parties agreeing to the government statement.

### 西德议院举行外交政策辩论

    西德议院举行外交政策辩论
    新华社据塔斯社波恩三日讯　德意志联邦共和国（西德）外交部长勃伦塔诺一日在西德联邦议院就日内瓦四国外交部长会议发表了政府声明。他指出，西方国家在日内瓦会议上所持的立场同德意志联邦共和国政府的立场是完全一致的。
    勃伦塔诺暗示，西德政府打算继续奉行在巴黎协定的基础上参加西方国家的军事集团的政策。在结束他的充满了对德意志民主共和国政府的激烈攻击的演说时，勃伦塔诺谈到同德意志民主共和国的“技术性联系”的问题。勃伦塔诺重复说，在这样做的时候，谈不到承认德意志民主共和国。
    西德联邦议院二日举行关于政府声明的外交辩论。德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在辩论中发言，指责联邦政府在德国重新统一问题上实际上抛弃了独立政策。
    奥伦豪尔说：如果不愿意使德国两部分都脱离军事联盟、并且在考虑到为了保障它自身的安全和它的伙伴们的安全所必需的义务的情况下把统一后的德国包括在集体安全体系以内，那末不论是德国重新统一问题还是欧洲安全问题将来都不可能获得解决。
    奥伦豪尔说，德国社会民主党从日内瓦会议的结果中得出的结论是：“现在已是德国人自己特别努力以便在关于重新统一问题的谈判中取得尽可能大的进展的时候了。”同时，他批评苏联在德意志民主共和国问题上所采取的立场。他的发言清楚地表明，社会民主党关于同德意志民主共和国建立“技术性联系”的要求同实现德国人之间的真正的相互了解毫无共同之点。奥伦豪尔特别反对建立全德委员会。最后，奥伦豪尔警告不要匆忙实行规定武装西德的巴黎协定。
    西德总理阿登纳在一篇简短的发言中否认德意志联邦共和国是从“实力政策”出发的，但是他又说，在对苏联方面，“软弱政策”比“实力政策”更加危险。
    在辩论以后，联邦议院中的执政党联盟否决了社会民主党提出的动议，这个动议要求在统一后的德国拒绝加入军事集团的条件下和在德国参加集体安全体系的条件下恢复德国统一。联邦议院通过了政府联盟各党派所提出的同意政府声明的决议。
