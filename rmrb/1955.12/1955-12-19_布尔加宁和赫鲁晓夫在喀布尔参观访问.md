Xinhua News Agency, Kabul: According to Tass, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited the Kabul Military Academy on the 17th. This school is located in the area of the ancient Bala Hissar fortress on the eastern outskirts of Kabul, which was the site of many battles in the Afghan struggle for independence during the Anglo-Afghan wars of the last century.
    The principal of the military academy, Lieutenant General Mohammed Issa, welcomed the distinguished guests. During the visit, they were accompanied by Lieutenant General Sayed Salar, Chief of Staff of the Afghan Army, and other Afghan military personnel.
    In the afternoon of the same day, Khrushchev and Bulganin visited the medical school of Kabul University and talked with Afghan doctors.
    Next, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited the construction site of the Kabul Bread Combine Factory, which is being built with Soviet technical assistance. After completion, this combine factory will include a mechanized grain depot capable of storing 20,000 tons of grain, a flour mill with a daily milling capacity of 60 tons, and a bread factory with a daily output of 50 tons. The equipment and construction materials for the combine factory were shipped from the Soviet Union. Soviet experts participating in the construction of the combine factory are passing on Soviet experience to Afghan workers and engineers working here.
    In the evening, Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, Degtyar, held a banquet to celebrate Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Afghanistan.
    Those present at the banquet included Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed Naim Khan, Court Minister Ahmed Ali, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Khan, cabinet ministers, and other high-ranking officials.
    Subsequently, the Mayor of Kabul held a grand reception at the Officers' Club to entertain the Soviet guests. Those present included members of the Afghan government headed by Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan, diplomatic envoys from various countries, and representatives from all walks of life in Kabul. Bulganin spoke at the reception.
    Bulganin said that solid and friendly relations have long existed between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. We believe that our visit will promote the strengthening and further development of friendship between our two peoples and will help to expand economic, cultural, and other ties.
    Bulganin said that the Soviet people are well aware of the great losses suffered by the Afghan people at the hands of the colonizers, and that their domination in your country has hindered the economic development of your country. The Soviet people fully sympathize with the efforts of the Afghan people in consolidating the national independence of their country.
    To express the growing and strengthening friendship between the Soviet and Afghan peoples, we are entrusted by the Soviet government and people to present gifts to the Afghan government: fifteen buses for the city of Kabul and the equipment for a hospital with a total of one hundred and nine beds. Please accept these gifts from the Afghan government and the Kabul city authorities.
    Mayor Dr. Mohammed Yusuf Khan Suhail expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the gifts presented to the city of Kabul by Bulganin and Khrushchev.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在喀布尔参观访问
    新华社十八日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫十七日访问了喀布尔军事学校，这所学校是在阿富汗首都东郊古老的巴拉—锡萨尔要塞的地区里，在上一世纪英国—阿富汗战争时期中，这个地方曾经是阿富汗争取独立的许多战斗的战场。
    军事学校校长穆罕默德·伊萨中将向贵宾们表示欢迎。在参观的时候，陪同参观的有阿富汗陆军参谋长赛义德·萨勒中将和其他阿富汗军事人员。
    当天下午，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁参观了喀布尔大学的医学院，并且同阿富汗的医生们谈了话。
    接着，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫参观了在苏联技术援助之下正在进行建设的喀布尔面包联合工厂的建筑工地。这个联合工厂建成之后将包括一个能储存两万吨谷物的机械化谷仓，一所每昼夜能磨粉六十吨的磨粉厂，和一所每昼夜产量为五十吨的面包工厂。联合工厂的设备和建设所需的材料都是从苏联运来的。参加联合工厂建厂工作的苏联专家把苏联的经验传授给在这里工作的阿富汗工人和工程师。
    晚上，苏联驻阿富汗大使杰格佳尔为布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问阿富汗，举行宴会。
    出席宴会的有阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗、副首相兼外交大臣穆罕默德·纳伊姆汗、宫廷大臣艾哈迈德·阿里、副首相阿里·穆罕默德汗、各部部长和其他高级官员。
    随后，喀布尔市长在军官俱乐部举行盛大的招待会，招待苏联贵宾。出席的有以穆罕默德·达乌德汗首相为首的阿富汗政府人员，各国外交使节，喀布尔的各界代表。布尔加宁在招待会上讲了话。
    布尔加宁说，苏联和阿富汗之间早就存在着巩固的友好联系。我们认为，我们的访问将促进我们两国人民之间的友谊的加强和进一步的发展，并将有助于扩大经济、文化和其他联系。
    布尔加宁说，苏联人民知道得很清楚，殖民者使阿富汗人民遭受了重大的损失，他们在你们国家的支配阻碍了你们国家经济的发展。苏联人民十分同情阿富汗人民在巩固自己国家的民族独立方面的努力。
    为了表示苏联人民和阿富汗人民之间日益增长和加强的友谊，我们受苏联政府和人民的委托向阿富汗政府赠礼：赠给喀布尔市十五辆公共汽车和一个共有一百零九张病床的医院的设备。请阿富汗政府和喀布尔市当局接受这些礼物。
    市长穆罕默德·优素福汗·苏赫伊尔博士对布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫赠给喀布尔市的礼物表示衷心的感谢。
