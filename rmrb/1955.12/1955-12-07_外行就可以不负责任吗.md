    Can an Outsider Shirk Responsibility?
    Fan Zhongshan, the factory director of the Shanghai Joint State-Private New Asia Hygiene Materials Factory, sits in his office all day long. When problems arise in production, he calls in the workshop director. Whatever the workshop director suggests, he says, "Okay, let's do it that way!" If the workshop director says, "Let's try doing something and see," he replies, "Okay, let's try it!" When workers criticize him for not going down to the workshop and for being unwilling to discuss problems with them, he says, "I'm an outsider, it's useless for me to go down to the workshop."

    Later, he was criticized by the Shanghai Second Light Industry Party Committee at a joint meeting of factory branch secretaries and began to go to the workshop. However, his visits to the workshop were not to solve production problems or to become an insider, but to avoid being criticized for not going down to the workshop. Therefore, in the past month or two, when product quality was poor, he did not organize relevant personnel to investigate; when workers created good experiences, he did not organize efforts to summarize and promote them; and the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers were still locked in his drawer, just as before.

    To use the excuse of being an "outsider" to avoid going to the workshop, or to go without solving production problems. How can such a factory director shoulder the important responsibility of leading the entire enterprise?

    外行就可以不负责任吗
    上海公私合营新亚卫生材料厂厂长范仲山，整天坐在办公室里。生产上有了问题，他就把车间主任叫来。车间主任说怎么做，他就说：“好吧，就这样吧！”车间主任说试着做些什么看，他就说：“好吧，就试试看吧！”工人们批评他不下车间、不肯同工人研究问题，他就说：“我是外行，下车间也没用。”
    后来，他在各厂支部书记联席会上受到了中共上海第二轻工业党委的批评，开始到车间里去了。不过，他到车间里去不是为了解决生产问题，不是为了变成内行，而是为了避免人家批评他不下车间。所以，近一、两个月来，产品质量不好，他不组织有关人员研究；工人创造了好的经验，他不组织力量加以总结和推广；工人们提的合理化建议，他仍旧像以前一样把它们锁在抽屉里。
    借口是“外行”就不到车间里去，或者去了不解决生产问题。这样的厂长怎么能担负起领导整个企业的重大责任呢？
