    Producing in a Standardized Manner is the Only Way to Guarantee the Quality of New Products
    By Our Staff Reporter Jin Yukun
    An unpleasant incident occurred at the ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the successful trial production of a Soviet-style precision boring machine at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant in July of last year: As the ceremony reached its final segment – a cutting demonstration – and as a wire recorder was slowly turning, recording the melody of metal being cut, the machine suddenly malfunctioned. No matter how the buttons were pressed, the machine only emitted a "whirring" sound, remaining motionless. This new product, which was thought to have been successfully trial-produced, thus automatically declared itself unqualified. Further inspection by the Second Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building revealed that not a single one of the more than 380 machine tools in the factory's inventory was合格! Some of the machine tools that had already been shipped were unable to start immediately after installation.
    Due to the poor quality of the products, deliveries could not be made on time, affecting the production and construction of 48 factories and mines. The First Automobile Works, unable to obtain the large number of machine tools it had ordered from the Second Machine Tool Plant on time, had to place orders abroad temporarily, which increased many difficulties and delayed the schedule.
    The poor product quality of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant has certain historical roots. Before liberation, this factory was merely a repair shop. After liberation, it began to manufacture some old-fashioned belt-driven machine tools. Because the requirements at that time were not high, the products that were patched together were not only usable but also received good evaluations. After large-scale construction began, what the state needed was no longer old-fashioned belt-driven machine tools, but various precision Soviet-style boring and drilling machines. This required enterprises to carry out a series of technological transformations, transforming the original repair shop into a modern manufacturing plant. However, the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant did not actively take measures and continued to move slowly like an old ox pulling a broken cart. Because they did not see the changes in the state's needs, nor did they feel the contradiction between leadership lagging behind objective needs, they were satisfied with past achievements, thinking that "in the past, we could only repair and assemble, and now it is already not bad that we can produce such machines!" When users criticized the product quality, they emphasized that "current conditions are insufficient," "it is unavoidable to have some problems," and "aren't other factories the same?" They even interpreted the criticism as "users don't know how to use our machines," complaining that "the higher authorities demand too much," "Soviet experts demand too much," and "users demand too much." This complacency was even more seriously reflected in their poor learning of Soviet advanced experience, failure to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and failure to operate conscientiously in accordance with Soviet drawings and technological regulations.
    In light of this situation, the factory's Party organization criticized complacency and pointed out that in recent years the factory had added a large number of modern equipment and had sufficient Soviet drawings and technical data. As long as they conscientiously and diligently learn from Soviet advanced experience, it would be entirely possible to change this situation. Subsequently, a Soviet expert team headed by Chukanov and Prokhorov arrived. The higher-level Party committee and economic leading organs also sent working groups.
    With the help of Soviet experts, the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant carried out a series of reforms. Soviet experts pointed out that the most important thing for a modern machine-building factory is to do things in a standardized manner and must proceed step by step in strict accordance with the objective laws of science. Starting mass production before the samples have been successfully trial-produced is like "wanting to run before learning to walk," and the result is patching things up while working, completing a year's task in two years. This is exactly what the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant did, and the unqualified products from last year were not repaired until October of this year.
    To "learn to walk," one must re-enter the arena in a "standardized manner" in accordance with the new product trial production procedure. The first step is sample trial production, the purpose of which is to solve design problems and to compile process regulations and manufacturing process equipment based on correct drawings. The second step is small-batch trial production, the main purpose of which is to solve manufacturing problems, to verify whether the process regulations and process equipment are advanced, and whether the machine tool equipment can achieve the required machining accuracy. The third step is small-batch production, the main purpose of which is to "train troops," cultivate talents, and accumulate management experience for mass production. The four new products trial-produced this year have smoothly entered mass production because they were strictly carried out in accordance with these three steps. In particular, the majority of process regulations and process equipment were modified to varying degrees during small-batch trial production, which greatly reduced the chaos in mass manufacturing.
    However, to ensure the quality of products manufactured in large quantities, all employees must develop the habit of civilized production in a standardized manner.
    The difference between civilized and uncivilized production lies first and foremost in whether workers strictly abide by process regulations. In the past, most of the products of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant did not have process regulations at all; the process documents for a small number of products were sent to the workshops, but they were locked in the drawers of the workshop directors. Workers were "free to work" and "showed their own unique skills." Twenty experienced masters had twenty kinds of processing methods, and whether the quality standards could be met depended on "luck." The handicraft style of "knocking, hammering, filing, and scraping" could be seen everywhere. Parts could not be assembled without "surgery" and could not be "seated" without "matching numbers." This kind of repair style in production was the most important and most direct reason why the quality of parts in the factory was unqualified in the past.
    In order to completely change this uncivilized production style, Soviet experts personally helped to compile the process documents for the main parts. After the process documents were verified, the factory director personally awarded them to the workshop directors at the factory-wide employee meeting, and at the same time announced to all employees that modifications to the documents must be approved by the factory director and the chief engineer. Changing the old habits of workers for many years is a complex ideological education work. The Party and trade union organizations have done a lot of work in this regard. Taking platform lapping as an example, it is easy to do and can improve quality by following the new process regulations, but workers are accustomed to the old methods that are both tiring and cannot guarantee quality. They use the new methods when someone is checking during the day, and the old methods when no one is checking at night. After the leadership discovered this situation, they organized training classes, carried out a lot of persuasion and education, and used practical operations to prove that the new methods not only guarantee quality but also increase efficiency by more than one time. Only then did the workers gradually believe in the process regulations and consciously abide by the process regulations. In the rectification of process discipline, resolute struggles were also launched against serious violations of process discipline. For example, Li Tingxiu, the foreman of the machining workshop, disobeyed the inspector's stop and ordered the workers to violate the process regulations, resulting in the scrapping of a batch of spline shafts, causing a great loss. The leadership immediately gave him a warning as punishment to maintain the seriousness of the process discipline.
    Inspection work is the "eyes" of the factory and an important link in ensuring product quality. In the past, some inspectors did not rely on instruments, but relied on hand touching, ear listening, and eye watching to conduct inspections. Some inspectors were afraid of hurting personal feelings and lightly let go of unqualified parts. Some workers fooled the quality. If the part tolerance was too large or too small, they used methods such as "sun exposure," "warm air blowing," and "cold water cooling" to deceive the inspectors by means of thermal expansion and contraction. The measuring tools and gauges used to check product quality had lost their accuracy because they had not been inspected and verified for a long time. For example, none of the 200 platforms in the factory were qualified, and some measuring tools had exceeded the allowable error by 20 times. With such tools, it was impossible to prevent the proliferation of defective products.
    In order to thoroughly rectify the inspection work, the factory removed the inspection section chief who had always been irresponsible, reallocated the inspection personnel, and promoted the Soviet-style work section inspection system, distributing inspectors to the production line. All basic measuring tools and gauges were calibrated and repaired, and a measurement system was established based on Soviet advanced experience. Precision optical instruments were purchased, and periodic identification of measuring tools and gauges was carried out to ensure their own accuracy. In this way, the quality of measuring tools and gauges used for inspection is controlled by measuring instruments, and the quality of process equipment and processed parts is controlled by measuring tools and gauges, thereby strictly controlling the generation of unqualified parts. To do a good job of inspection, it is more important to give play to the initiative of inspection personnel. For example, Feng Huanzhang, an inspector in the tool workshop, often took the initiative to patrol the machine tools. Once, a female worker, Song Ronggui, made a mistake in reading the drawings when processing parts. Because he discovered it in time, the scrapping of the entire batch of parts was avoided. He often worked with production workers to study ways to improve product quality and actively prevent the generation of defective products. The quality of the products in the work section he was responsible for was improved, and the number of defective products was reduced, so he was deeply loved by the workshop leaders, staff, and workers. The leadership promptly commended this proactive and responsible spirit and called on everyone to learn from him.
    To make the inspection work truly play a role in controlling product quality, the inspection section must be made the comprehensive supervisor of the factory's product quality. The factory leadership gave the inspection section great power. The inspection section has the right to intervene in all incorrect practices that affect product quality, such as violating process regulations, materials that do not meet specifications, and unreasonable use of machine tools. When necessary, measures such as stopping production and refusing acceptance can be taken to stop behaviors that ignore product quality.
    With the help of Soviet experts, the factory also carried out a comprehensive inspection and adjustment of all precision machining tools in the factory, and established a system of preventive maintenance, overhaul, and periodic inspection of the lubrication system. At the same time, the organizational structure of the factory was adjusted according to Soviet experience.
    Through this series of work, the factory fundamentally and gradually changed its uncivilized style and established a normal production technology order. A new atmosphere and new habits have been established. Workers generally feel that it is impossible to produce without process documents now. Machine tools are often wiped very clean, and processed parts and tools are arranged in an orderly manner. The rejection rate of castings in the foundry workshop used to be as high as 38%, but now it has dropped to about 4%. The factory's overall rejection rate has also dropped to the lowest record in the factory's history. The failure rate of major precision parts such as gears, drill rods, and feed boxes often reached more than 50% in the past, but now they basically meet the design requirements. The four new products trial-produced this year have been verified by the state and proved to fully meet the standards of Soviet drawings. Among them, two types of vertical drills have already begun mass production, and Soviet-style radial drills and boring machines are also being shipped one after another. The experience of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant vividly illustrates that as long as we conscientiously learn from Soviet experience and produce in a standardized manner, it is entirely possible to guarantee the quality of new products.

    规规矩矩地生产，才能保证新产品的质量
    本报记者　金雨困
    沈阳第二机床厂在去年七月庆祝苏联式精密镗床试制成功的剪彩大会上，发生了一件令人不愉快的事情：大会进行到最后一个节目——切削表演，当钢丝录音机正在徐徐转动、记录着切削金属的旋律的时候，机床突然发生了故障，无论怎么按动电钮，机床也只是“呜呜”地直叫，身子连动也不动。这个被认为已经试制“成功”的新产品，就这样自动地宣布不合格了。经第一机械工业部第二机器工业管理局进一步检查，发现全厂库存的三百八十多台机床竟然没有一台是合格的！已经出厂的机床，也有的刚安装好就开不动了。
    由于产品质量不好，不能按期交货，影响了四十八个厂矿的生产和建设。第一汽车制造厂因为不能按时从第二机床厂得到所订的大批机床，不得不临时向国外订货，增加了许多困难，耽误了时间。
    沈阳第二机床厂产品质量不好是有一定的历史根源的。这个厂解放前只是一个修配工厂，解放后，才开始制造一些旧式皮带机床。由于当时的要求不高，那些凑付出来的产品不但可用，而且还得到过较好的评价。大规模的建设开始以后，国家需要的不再是旧式皮带机床，而是各种精密的苏联式镗床和钻床了。这就要求企业必须进行一系列的技术改造，把原来的修配厂转变为现代化的制造工厂。但是，沈阳第二机床厂并没有积极采取措施，仍然如老牛破车似的慢腾腾地走着。由于看不到国家需要的变化，感不到领导落后于客观需要的矛盾，也就满足于过去的成绩，认为“过去只能修修配配，现在能出这样的机器就不错啦”！当用户对产品质量提出批评的时候，他们就强调“目前条件不足”、“出点毛病是在所难免的”、“其它工厂也还不是一样？”甚至把批评解释为“用户不会使用我们的机器”，埋怨“上级要求太高了”，“苏联专家要求高了”，“用户要求高了”。这种自满情绪更严重地表现在学习苏联先进经验很差，不认真执行苏联专家的建议，不认真按照苏联图纸和工艺规程操作。
    工厂党组织根据这种情况，批判了自满情绪，并且指出几年来工厂增加了大量的现代化设备，有足够的苏联图纸和技术资料，只要老老实实、勤勤恳恳地认真学习苏联先进经验，要改变这种现状是完全可能的。接着，又来了以楚堪诺夫、普洛哈洛夫为首的苏联专家工作组。上级党委和经济领导机关也都派来了工作组。
    在苏联专家帮助下，沈阳第二机床厂进行了一系列的改革。苏联专家指出：现代化的机器制造工厂最重要的是要规规矩矩办事，必须严格根据科学的客观规律循序前进。样品尚未试制成功就开始大批生产，就好比“没有学会走路就想跑步”，结果是边干边打补钉，一年任务两年完成。沈阳第二机床厂正是这样，去年的不合格产品直到今年十月才修完。
    要“学会走路”，就必须按照新产品试制程序重新“规规矩矩上场”。第一步就是样品试制，目的是解决设计问题，并且根据正确的图纸编制工艺规程和制造工艺装备。第二步是小批试制，主要是解决制造问题，证实工艺规程和工艺装备是否先进和机床设备是否能达到应有的加工精度。第三步才是小批生产，主要是“练兵”，为成批制造培养人材和积累管理经验。今年试制的四种新产品，由于严格按照这三个步骤进行，就顺利地进入了大批生产。特别是在小批试制中把大部工艺规程和工艺装备作了不同程度的修改，就大大减少了大批制造中的混乱现象。
    但是，要保证大批制造的产品质量，还必须全体职工养成规规矩矩的文明生产的习惯。
    生产的文明和不文明的区别，首先在于工人是否严格遵守工艺规程。沈阳第二机床厂过去的大部分产品根本没有工艺规程；少数产品的工艺文件发到了车间，也被锁在车间主任的抽屉里。工人都是“自由干活”“各显神通”，二十个老师傅就有二十种加工方法，能否达到质量标准就靠碰“运气”。“敲敲打打、锉锉括括”的手工业作风随处可见。零件不经“动手术”就不能装配，不经“对号”就无法“入座”。这种生产上的修配作风就是工厂过去零件质量不合格的最重要和最直接的原因。
    为了彻底改变这种不文明的生产作风，苏联专家亲自帮助编制主要零件的工艺文件。经过验正后的工艺文件，由厂长在全厂职工大会上亲自授予各车间主任，同时向全体职工宣布：修改文件必须经过厂长和总工程师批准。要改变工人多少年来的老习惯是一项复杂的思想教育工作。党和工会组织在这方面进行了不少工作。以平台括研为例，按照新的工艺规程干起来既轻松又能提高质量，但是工人习惯于既累人又不能保证质量的老方法，白天有人检查的时候用新方法，晚上无人检查就用老方法。领导上发现这一情况后，就组织了训练班，进行了许多说服教育，并且用实际操作来证明新方法既保证质量，又能提高效率一倍以上，工人才逐渐信服了工艺规程，自觉地遵守工艺规程。在整顿工艺纪律中，对严重违反工艺纪律的现象也展开了坚决的斗争。如加工车间工长李廷秀不听检查员的制止，擅自命令工人违反工艺规程，结果使一批花键轴全部报废，造成了很大损失。领导上立即给予了警告处分，以维护工艺纪律的严肃性。
    检查工作是工厂的“眼睛”，是保证产品质量的重要环节。过去，有的检查员不是靠仪器，而是凭手摸、耳听、眼看来进行检查。有的检查员怕伤私人情面，竟将不合格的零件轻轻放过。有的工人糊弄质量，零件公差大了或小了，就用“太阳晒”、
  “暖风吹”、“凉水镇”等热涨冷缩的办法骗过检查员。用以检查产品质量的量具和检具，由于长期不进行检查核对，大部都已失去精度。如全厂二百台平台没有一台是合格的，有的量具已超过了容许的误差二十倍。用这样的工具根本无法防止废品的泛滥。
    为彻底整顿检查工作，工厂撤换了一贯不负责任的检查科长，重新调配了检查人员，推行了苏联的工段检查制，把检查员分布到生产线上去。全部基本量具和检具都校正和检修了，并且根据苏联先进经验建立了计量系统，购买了精密的光学仪器，对量具和检具进行定期的鉴定工作，以保证它本身的准确性。这样由计量仪器来控制检查用的量具和检具的质量，由量具和检具来控制工艺装备和加工零件的质量，从而严格地控制了不合格零件的产生。要做好检查工作，更重要的是发挥检查人员的主动性。如工具车间检查员冯焕章经常主动到车床上去巡视，有一次女工宋荣贵加工零件看错了图纸，由于他及时发现而避免了整批零件的报废。他经常和生产工人一起研究改进产品质量的办法，积极防止了废品的产生，他负责检查的工段的产品质量提高了，废品减少了，因此深受车间领导工作人员和工人的爱戴。领导上就及时表扬了这种主动负责的精神，号召大家向他学习。
    要使检查工作真正能够起到控制产品质量的作用，必须使检查科成为工厂产品质量的全面监督者。工厂领导上给检查科以很大的权力。对违反工艺规程、材料不合规格、使用机床不合理等一切影响产品质量的不正当作法，检查科都有权干涉，必要时可采取停止生产拒绝验收等措施来制止忽视产品质量的行为。
    在苏联专家帮助下，工厂又对全厂精密加工机床进行了全面的检修和调整，建立预修、检修和定期检查润滑系统的制度。同时按照苏联经验调整了全厂的组织机构。
    经过这一系列的工作，工厂从根本上逐渐改变了不文明的作风，建立了正常的生产技术秩序。新风气新习惯树立起来了。工人普遍感到现在离开了工艺文件就没法生产。机床经常擦洗得非常干净，加工零件和工具都排列得有条不紊。铸造车间的铸件废品率，过去最高达百分之三十八，现在已经降到百分之四左右。全厂废品率也降到工厂有史以来的最低纪录。主要的精密零件如齿轮、钻杆、送刀箱等，过去不合格率经常达到百分之五十以上，现在基本上达到了设计要求。今年试制的四种新产品，经过国家鉴定，证实完全达到了苏联图纸的标准。其中两种立钻已经开始成批生产，苏联式摇臂钻和镗床也陆续出厂了。沈阳第二机床厂的经验生动地说明了：只要老老实实地学习苏联经验，规规矩矩生产，保证新产品的质量是完全可能的。
