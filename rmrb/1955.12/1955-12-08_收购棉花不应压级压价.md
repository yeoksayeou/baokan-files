Purchasing Cotton Should Not Suppress Grades and Prices
Dai Ming

Cotton produced in Hubei Province is generally of medium grade or below, with very short fibers, making it unsuitable for mechanical spinning. This year, Hubei Province has vigorously promoted improved varieties, and in many areas the cotton quality has reached sub-superior grade, with longer fibers. This is a good phenomenon. In the cotton purchasing work, the policy of "better cotton, better price" should be implemented to promote the improvement of cotton varieties in Hubei Province.

However, some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have adopted the erroneous practice of "rather be strict than lenient" in suppressing grades and prices. For example, the Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huangmei County downgraded cotton with a fiber length of 1 and 1/16 inches to 1 inch, purchasing more than 133,000 jin of it. Similarly, the Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jianli County even downgraded cotton of the same fiber length to below 1 inch. According to the regulations of the relevant central departments, the moisture content standard for seed cotton in Hubei Province is 12.5%. This year, the seed cotton in Hubei Province is relatively dry, with a moisture content of generally only 8% to 9%, and the difference below the standard should be compensated to the farmers. However, many supply and marketing cooperatives have not done so. One purchasing point in Huangmei County purchased more than 110,000 jin of cotton, and the farmers lost more than 1,200 yuan just from the under-compensation of moisture. The acts of harming the interests of cotton farmers are also manifested in lowering the ginning outturn rate (i.e., the percentage of lint cotton that can be extracted from seed cotton). The ginning outturn rate of the new cotton purchased in the Fourth District of Jianli County this year is 38% to 41%, but the supply and marketing cooperative only calculated it according to the standard of 35%. These erroneous practices have enabled the supply and marketing cooperatives to obtain staggering illegal profits. The Mianyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in September and October, used the erroneous methods of suppressing grades and prices to purchase 50% of the cotton in the county, earning a total surplus of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. The Hubei Provincial Textile Fiber Inspection Bureau recently inspected 34,000 dan of new cotton from ten counties, including Daye, Jiayu, and Echeng, in Hankou. Among them, more than 9,900 dan were downgraded in terms of grade, and more than 16,000 dan were downgraded in terms of fiber length. The supply and marketing cooperatives could earn more than 80,000 yuan from these two items alone.

This behavior of suppressing grades and prices has aroused the dissatisfaction of farmers and affected their enthusiasm for selling cotton. The daily amount of new cotton entering the market in Cihua District of Dangyang County has dropped from more than 40,000 jin in the past to less than 20,000 jin. In some areas of Gong'an County, cotton farmers are abandoning nearby markets and carrying cotton to Hunan for sale.

The main reason for the phenomenon of suppressing grades and prices is that some purchasing personnel have capitalist business ideas. An employee of the Xihe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sui County once illegally purchased cotton and lost more than 40 yuan. Soon after, he used the means of suppressing grades and prices to earn a sum of money, making up for the loss and having more than 100 yuan left over. At this time, the cooperative no longer pursued his responsibility. The erroneous behavior of suppressing grades and prices is even more serious in some hired purchasing personnel, resulting in greater losses to the purchasing work.

Party committees and governments at all levels must pay close attention to this issue, conduct timely inspections of cotton purchasing work, and effectively eliminate this phenomenon. While strengthening the inspection of cotton quality, the supply and marketing cooperatives must strengthen ideological and policy education for purchasing personnel, so that they fully understand the significance of the state's unified purchase of cotton, and that they resolutely implement the policy of "better grade, better price" in cotton purchasing work.

### 收购棉花不应压级压价

    收购棉花不应压级压价
    戴明
    湖北省生产的棉花，质量一般在中级以下，纤维很短，不能用于机械纺织。今年，湖北省大规模地推广良种，不少地区棉花质量达到次上级，纤维也长了。这是一种好现象。在收棉工作中，应该贯彻执行“优棉优价”政策，以推进湖北省棉种改良工作。
    但是有些基层供销合作社却采取了“宁紧勿松”的压级压价的错误作法。例如，黄梅县三区供销合作社曾把绒长一又十六分之一吋的棉花压作一吋，收进了十三万三千多斤；同样绒长的棉花，监利县四区供销合作社甚至压到一吋以下。按照中央有关部门的规定，湖北省籽棉的含水量标准是百分之十二点五；今年湖北省的籽棉晒得较干；含水量一般只有百分之八到九，低于标准的部分，理应找补给农民。可是不少供销合作社没有这样做。黄梅县有一个收购点，收进十一万多斤棉花，光是少补水分一项，就使农民损失了一千二百多元。损害棉农利益的行为，还表现在压低衣分率（即籽棉可榨皮棉数量的百分比）上。监利县四区今年收购的新棉，衣分率是百分之三十八到四十一，供销合作社只按百分之三十五的标准计算。这些错误作法，使供销合作社获得了惊人的非法利润。沔阳县供销合作社在九、十月间，用压级压价的错误方法收购全县百分之五十的棉花，一共赢余了八、九万元。湖北省纺织纤维检验局不久前在汉口检验来自大冶、嘉鱼、鄂城十个县的三万四千担新棉，其中品级被压低的占九千九百多担，纤维长度被压低的占一万六千多担；仅是这两项，供销合作社就可以赢余八万多元。
    这种压级压价的行为已经引起了农民的不满，影响了他们售棉的积极性。当阳县慈化区每天的新棉上市量，已由过去的四万斤降到二万斤以下。公安县有的地区棉农舍近求远地把棉花挑到湖南去出售。
    造成压级压价现象的主要原因，在于一部分收购人员有资本主义的经营思想。随县淅河镇供销合作社的一个工作人员有一次非法收购棉花，亏了四十多元；不久，他就用压级压价的手段赚了一笔钱，弥补了亏空，还多余了一百多元。这时，合作社也就不再追查他的责任了。压级压价的错误行为在一些雇用的收购人员身上表现的更加严重，给收购工作造成的损失也就更大。
    各地党委和政府必须十分重视这个问题，对于棉花收购工作要及时进行检查，有效地杜绝这种现象。供销合作社必须在加强收花检验工作的同时，对收购人员加强思想教育和政策教育，使他们充分认识国家统购棉花的意义，要他们在收棉工作中坚决执行“优级优价”政策。
