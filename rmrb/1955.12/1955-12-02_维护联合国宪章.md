Uphold the United Nations Charter
Chinese Political Science and Law Association Director Chen Tiqiang

On November 21st, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution proposed by the United States, Britain and other countries to convene a conference to review the United Nations Charter. Everyone knows that the current form of the United Nations Charter is a document that conforms to the basic interests and aspirations of the people of all countries. It is fully suitable for the task of consolidating universal peace and developing international cooperation, and there is no need to revise it at all. The United States' forced passage of this resolution is another step in the US group's attempt to undermine the UN Charter. As Mr. Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, pointed out at the General Assembly, the practice of changing the Charter will not only not strengthen trust in relations between countries, but will make this goal more difficult to achieve. Obviously, the US ruling group is trying its best to deepen the divisions between UN member states, thereby hindering the easing of international tensions.

The United Nations Charter is a solemn covenant formulated by the anti-fascist allied countries after defeating the fascist bandits in order to establish lasting world peace and eliminate the roots of war. The lofty principles on which it is based, especially the equality of sovereignty between large and small countries, and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, undoubtedly reflect the ardent desire of the world's people, "who have twice experienced the unspeakable scourge of war," for peace and security. At the same time, the United Nations Charter is also the product of mutual trust among the anti-fascist allied countries. The declaration of the Tehran Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which laid the foundation for the United Nations, clearly stated: "We express our determination that our countries will work together in war and in the subsequent peace." This spirit is reflected in the United Nations Charter, especially the Charter stipulates that the major powers, which made significant contributions to defeating fascism in the war, must coordinate on all major international issues. This principle of great power unanimity became the cornerstone of the United Nations—and also of world peace.

The Charter itself is beyond reproach. In the early years of the United Nations, government leaders of the United States, Britain, and other countries used many pleasant words to praise it. For example, former US Secretary of State Byrnes said in a speech on February 28, 1946: "We must abide by the Charter; it is the only path to peace." Today, the Charter has not changed. So, why does the United States regard the Charter as so disagreeable that it must be revised? The answer is that the US ruling group has increasingly deviated from the spirit of the UN Charter after the war, embarked on the road of "cold war" and preparation for a new war, and feels that some important provisions in the Charter hinder its actions.

Looking back at the history of the United Nations, it can be clearly seen how the US ruling group has gradually departed from the path of the United Nations Charter, which it solemnly signed, and dragged the world to the brink of another world war. The Charter itself cannot act; its effect and role depend on the common observance and maintenance of its member states. In reality, however, certain important member states, led by the United States, have been constantly undermining the Charter by implementing policies of aggression and war.

The history of the past ten years has fully proved this. For example, the Charter clearly stipulates that the sovereignty of all countries should be respected and that there should be no interference in internal affairs, but the United States has interfered in China's internal affairs, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique; interfering in the anti-colonial liberation war in Indochina; organizing subversive activities against the people's democratic countries; creating coups in Guatemala and other countries; and exerting crude pressure on many countries, forcing them to accept the will of the United States. The Charter clearly stipulates that no aggression should be carried out, but the United States has used force to invade Korea and our Taiwan. The Charter requires promoting the development of international economic relations, but the United States has forced the implementation of "embargoes," prohibiting Western countries from conducting normal trade with peaceful and democratic countries. The Charter requires disarmament, but the United States has repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament and the abolition of atomic weapons. Moreover, the United States, disregarding the clear provisions of the Charter regarding the qualifications of member states, unreasonably excludes the people's democratic countries from joining; disregarding the provisions of the Charter regarding regional organizations, it organizes aggressive military blocs everywhere aimed at encircling the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; disregarding the principle of equitable geographical distribution in the Charter, it forcibly inserts countries not belonging to Eastern Europe into the seats of Eastern European countries in the Security Council; disregarding the provisions of the Charter regarding the powers of the Security Council, it illegally organizes "Temporary Committees" ("Small General Assembly") and "Collective Measures Committees" to usurp the powers of the Security Council.

These are just some of the most blatant of the countless examples of the United States violating the Charter. In addition, the US group's deprivation of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations is an extremely arrogant and serious act of undermining the Charter. This is a trampling on the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, which serves as the political foundation of the United Nations Charter.

The matter is very clear. The US ruling group has abandoned the path of international cooperation and pursued a war policy of "strength." This policy is incompatible with the basic principles of the Charter, especially the most fundamental principle for guaranteeing world peace—the principle of unanimity among the major powers. That is why the United States has been painstakingly trying to overthrow this principle. The main conspiracy of the United States' proposed revision of the Charter this time is to destroy this principle of great power unanimity. Dulles's speech to the Subcommittee on Charter Review of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 18, 1954, fully exposed this conspiracy of the United States. He openly clamored that, due to the principle of unanimity among the major powers, the United States cannot manipulate everything in the Security Council. Therefore, he believed that the main responsibility of the Security Council for maintaining international peace and security should be either "handed over to various security organizations" (referring to aggressive military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) or "let the General Assembly without veto power bear more responsibility." This is the main purpose of the United States' advocacy of revising the Charter.

The activities of the United States in using the method of revising the Charter to achieve the destruction of the principle of great power unanimity did not begin today. As early as 1948, just over two years after the founding of the United Nations, the US Senate passed the so-called "Vandenberg Resolution," demanding the revision of the Charter in order to eliminate the use of the veto power on the issue of admitting new member states and the issue of peaceful settlement of disputes. In November 1953, during the 8th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States had forced the Legal Committee to pass a resolution to prepare for the revision of the Charter. In fact, as early as July 28 of the same year, the US Senate had appointed a committee to specifically study and promote the issue of Charter revision. During this period, high-ranking officials of the State Department, including the US Secretary of State, gave speeches everywhere advocating the revision of the Charter, and launched some so-called non-governmental organizations to carry out propaganda for the revision of the Charter, attempting to create public opinion. Dulles's speech to the American Bar Association in Boston on August 26, 1953, fully exposed the consistent conspiracy of the United States to tear up the Charter. He said: At the time of the San Francisco Conference, atomic bombs were not yet known; therefore, "the Charter is a pre-atomic age Charter. In this sense, it was already outdated before it actually took effect." The meaning of this sentence is very blatant. According to Dulles, after the United States mastered the atomic bomb, the United Nations Charter should be kicked aside and replaced by a new Charter that would make the whole world prostrate at the feet of the American atomic empire. Unfortunately, Dulles's dream has not been realized, the US monopoly on atomic bombs has long been shattered, and the people of the world firmly believe that the principle of unanimity among the major powers is still an important guarantee of international peace. If there is any difference between 1955 and 1945 due to the invention of the atomic bomb, it is that in 1955 the principle of unanimity among the major powers is even more important than in 1945.

Of course, due to the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations organization has often been used as a tool of US policy, but despite this, the United Nations still occupies a certain important position in international affairs. For example, the UN resolution calling for disarmament adopted in 1946, the resolution prohibiting war propaganda in 1947, the resolution calling for cooperation among major powers in 1948, the resolution on the Disarmament Commission in 1954, and the discussions held in the United Nations on some international issues related to the maintenance of peace and security – all of these are undeniable contributions of the United Nations organization to playing its role in maintaining peace.

It is entirely possible for the United Nations to play a role conducive to international peace. The shortcomings of the United Nations today are not due to a bad Charter, but to the result of the Charter being undermined. To strengthen the role of the United Nations, the solution is not to revise the Charter, but to make it truly embark on the track of the Charter. This requires all member states, especially the major powers, to strictly abide by the spirit of the Charter and fulfill their obligations.

The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, as well as peace-loving countries such as India, have always been faithful to the Charter, and they have consistently fought to defend the Charter.

Facts show that the US attempt to tamper with the United Nations Charter is very unpopular. During the General Assembly debate, Syria proposed an amendment calling for the deletion of the sentence convening a conference to review the Charter. Although this amendment was rejected by the US-controlled majority, there were still as many as twenty-three countries that disagreed with the US approach. It must be pointed out that, according to Article 109, Paragraph 2 of the Charter, any revision of the Charter requires the approval of two-thirds of the member states, including all permanent members of the Security Council, to take effect.

Therefore, it is very clear that the conspiracy of the United States to tamper with the United Nations Charter is doomed to failure.

    维护联合国宪章
  　中国政治法律学会理事　陈体强
    十一月二十一日，联合国大会在美国操纵之下，通过了美英等国提出的关于召开一次审查联合国宪章的会议的决议。谁都知道，现有形式的联合国宪章是符合各国人民的基本利益和愿望的文件，它完全适合巩固普遍和平和发展国际合作的任务，根本不需要修改。美国强迫通过这个决议，乃是美国集团企图破坏联合国宪章的又一个步骤。正如苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在大会上所指出的，改变宪章的做法不但不会加强国与国关系中的信任，反而会使这个目标更难实现。很显然，美国统治集团是竭力想加深联合国会员国之间的分歧，借此阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
    联合国宪章是反法西斯的同盟国家在击败法西斯强盗之后为了建立世界永久和平、消除战争根源而制定的一个庄严公约。它所依据的崇高原则，特别是大小国家主权平等、不同社会制度的国家和睦相处这些原则，无疑地反映了“两度身历惨不堪言之战祸”的世界人民对和平与安全的殷切愿望。同时，联合国宪章也是反法西斯同盟国家互相信任的产物。奠定联合国基础的苏、美、英三国德黑兰会议宣言曾明确宣布：“我们表示我们的决心，我们的国家在战争方面，以及在随后的和平方面，都将共同工作。”这种精神在联合国宪章中得到了体现，特别是宪章规定，在战争中对击败法西斯作了重大贡献的大国，对于一切重大国际问题都必须协调一致。这种大国一致原则成为联合国——同时也是世界和平——的基石。
    宪章本身是无可非议的。在联合国创始的年代里，美英等国的政府领袖曾经用过许多动听的词句赞许过它。例如，前美国国务卿贝尔纳斯一九四六年二月二十八日在一次演讲中说过：“我们必须遵守宪章；这是走向和平的唯一道路。”今天，宪章并没有变。那末，美国把宪章看成这样不合心意，一定要加以修改，这是为什么呢？回答是：美国统治集团战后日益背离联合国宪章的精神，走上“冷战”和准备新战争的道路，感到宪章中的一些重要规定有碍它的手脚。
    打开联合国历史来看，可以清楚地看出美国统治集团怎样一步步地离开了它自己庄严签订的联合国宪章的道路，而把世界拖向另一次大战的边缘。宪章本身是不能行动的；它的效果和作用取决于它的会员国的共同遵守和维护。实际的情形却是，以美国为首的某些重要的会员国，由于实施侵略和战争的政策对宪章不断地进行破坏。
    十年来的历史完全证明了这一点。举例来说，宪章明明规定要尊重各国主权，不得干涉内政，而美国却干涉中国内政，庇护蒋介石卖国集团；干涉印度支那的反殖民统治的解放战争；组织对各人民民主国家的颠覆活动；在危地马拉和其他国家制造政变；对许多国家加施粗暴的压力，迫使它们接受美国的意志。宪章明明规定不得进行侵略，而美国却以武力侵略朝鲜和我国台湾。宪章要求促进国际经济关系的发展，而美国却强迫实施“禁运”，禁止西方各国同和平民主的国家进行正常贸易。宪章要求实行裁军，而美国却一再拒绝苏联提出的关于裁军及废除原子武器的建议。美国并且不顾宪章中关于会员国资格的明白规定，无理排斥人民民主国家加入；不顾宪章中关于区域组织的规定，到处组织以包围苏联和人民民主国家为目的的侵略性军事集团；不顾宪章中关于地域公允分配原则，硬将不属东欧地区的国家塞在安理会中东欧国家的席位上；不顾宪章中关于安理会的职权的规定，非法组织“临时委员会”（“小型联大”）和“集体措施委员会”，以篡夺安理会的职权。
    这些不过是美国违反宪章的无数事例中的最彰明昭著的一些。此外，美国集团剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国中合法地位，更是一件极端蛮横地破坏宪章的严重行为。这是对作为联合国宪章的政治基础的五大国一致原则的践踏。
    事情是很清楚的，美国统治集团背弃了当初国际合作的道路，而奉行了“实力地位”的战争政策。这种政策同宪章的基本原则，特别是保证世界和平的最根本的原则——大国一致原则——不能相容。这就是为什么美国处心积虑想推翻这项原则。这次美国修改宪章的建议，主要的阴谋就是想摧毁这个大国一致原则。杜勒斯一九五四年一月十八日在美国参议院外交委员会审查宪章小组委员会的演说，曾充分暴露美国的这个阴谋。他公开叫嚷：由于大国一致原则，美国在安理会里不能操纵一切，因此他认为，安理会关于维持国际和平与安全的主要责任应该或者是“交给各种安全组织。”（按指北大西洋公约之类的侵略性军事集团），或者是“让没有否决权的大会负更多的责任”。这就是美国主张修改宪章的主要目的。
    美国用修改宪章的方法来达到破坏大国一致原则的活动不自今日始。远在一九四八年，联合国刚刚成立两年多，美国参议院就通过了所谓“范登堡决议”，要求修改宪章，以便取消在接纳新会员国问题和和平解决争端的问题上使用否决权。一九五三年十一月，第八届联合国大会会议期间，美国曾经强迫法律委员会通过为修改宪章预作准备的决议。实际上，早在同年七月二十八日美国参议院就已经指派了一个委员会专门研究和推动修改宪章问题。在这时期，美国国务卿以下的国务院高级官员到处发表演说鼓吹修改宪章，并发动某些所谓民间团体进行修改宪章的宣传，企图制造舆论。杜勒斯一九五三年八月二十六日在波士顿美国律师协会发表的演说，完全暴露了美国想撕毁宪章的一贯阴谋。他说：在旧金山会议的时候还不知道有原子弹；因此“宪章是一个原子时代以前的宪章。从这个意义上讲，它是在实际生效以前就已经过时了。”这句话的意思是非常露骨的。照杜勒斯的意思，在美国掌握了原子弹之后，联合国宪章就应当一脚踢开，而代之以一个使全世界匍匐在美国原子帝国脚下的新宪章。可惜是杜勒斯的美梦并没有能够实现，美国对原子弹的垄断早已告吹了，而全世界人民坚决认为大国一致原则仍然是国际和平的重要保证。假如一九五五年和一九四五年由于原子弹的发明而有什么不同的话，那就是在一九五五年大国一致原则比在一九四五年更加重要。
    固然由于美国的操纵，联合国组织常常被利用为美国的政策的工具，但是尽管如此，联合国在国际事务中仍然占有一定的重要地位。例如，一九四六年联合国通过的号召裁减军备的决议、一九四七年禁止战争宣传的决议、一九四八年号召各大国合作的决议、一九五四年关于裁军委员会的决议，以及在联合国中就维持和平与安全有关的一些国际问题所进行的讨论，这一切都是联合国组织发挥其维护和平的作用，是不能加以抹煞的。
    要使联合国发生有利于国际和平的作用是完全可能的。今天联合国所存在的缺点不是由于宪章不好，而是宪章受到破坏的结果。要加强联合国的作用，办法不是什么修改宪章，而是使它真正走上宪章的轨道，这就要求所有会员国特别是大国严格遵守宪章的精神，履行它所承担的义务。
    苏联和各人民民主国家，以及印度等爱好和平的国家一直是忠实于宪章的，它们也一贯为捍卫宪章而奋斗。
    事实表明，美国修改联合国宪章的图谋是非常不得人心的。在大会讨论过程中，叙利亚曾提出修正案，主张把召开审查宪章会议一句删除。这个修正案虽然被美国操纵的多数所否决，但是不同意美国的做法的仍有二十三国之多。必须指出，根据宪章第一百零九条第二项规定，对宪章的任何修改都需要会员国三分之二，包括安理会全体常任理事国的批准才能生效。
    因此，很显然，美国企图篡改联合国宪章的阴谋，是注定要失败的。
