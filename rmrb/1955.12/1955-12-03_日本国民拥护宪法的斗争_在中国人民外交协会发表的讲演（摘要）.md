The Japanese conservative forces and the conservative parties representing their interests are taking destructive actions against the current constitution. The conservative forces want to destroy it in two ways. On the one hand, they want to maliciously amend the constitution, and on the other hand, they want to corrode the constitution, causing it to rot and deteriorate from within.

In November 1954, the Constitution Revision Committee of the Yoshida Cabinet publicly issued a draft. According to that draft, they mainly wanted to amend Article 9, which stipulates the renunciation of war. The draft also proposed restoring the Emperor as head of state, giving the Emperor the power to declare war and make peace. In addition, they also wanted to restore the feudal family system.

In the past few years, Japan's conservative and reformist forces have engaged in a sharp struggle over whether to amend Article 9 of the constitution and rearm Japan.

The conservative parties' arguments vary, but they can be summarized into the following main points:

One argument is that the Japanese constitution was originally imposed on Japan by the United States. Now that Japan is independent, the fundamental law of Japan should be formulated by the Japanese themselves. The purpose of this statement is to use the Japanese people's desire for independence to deceive them. We thoroughly refuted this argument.

I often represented the Socialist Party in radio forums and campaign rallies of various parties, refuting them in this way: Since you believe that the Japanese constitution was imposed on Japan by the United States, why don't the conservative parties propose abolishing the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty? The whole world knows that these treaties were forced upon Japan by the United States. On the afternoon of the day the San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed, when the Japanese Diet had not yet passed it, the United States took Shigeru Yoshida to a room in an American military camp in San Francisco and signed the Security Treaty. Although the Security Treaty has only five articles, it has completely plundered Japan. As everyone knows, when Japanese imperialism ran rampant, it occupied Northeast China. The Japanese warlords and the puppet Manchuria government signed the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, which also had only three or four articles, and its content is almost a living replica of the current Security Treaty. There is a Japanese saying "reap what you sow." What it did in the Northeast in the past is currently being reproduced by the United States in Japan. According to the US-Japan Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement, the United States has established 733 military bases in Japan. The total area of military bases that Japanese people are not allowed to enter is equivalent to the size of Shikoku Island. The conservative parties say that the Japanese constitution was forced upon it by the United States, but they do not mention a word about treaties that so obviously betray the country and humiliate its people, which is clearly deceiving the people.

The United States has repeatedly asked successive Japanese cabinets to amend the constitution and establish an army, and the current cabinet's actions are only to satisfy the demands of the United States.

Another argument is that after the peace treaty came into effect, Japan has become independent, and an independent country should have an army. This argument is also inappropriate. Japan has not become an independent country. If Japan establishes an army under the current circumstances, these troops will become mercenaries of the United States, turning Japanese people into cannon fodder for the United States.

Another argument is that China is already a large communist country, and the development of the Communist Party of Japan is also very rapid. The Japanese Communist Party may carry out a violent revolution with the help of the CCP. At that time, the police alone will not be able to deal with it. In addition, there are 600,000 Koreans in Japan, who are all relatively radical. If they engage in revolution together with the Communist Party, the police alone will not be able to deal with it. Therefore, Japan must have an army. The remarks about the Soviet Union and China invading Japan are really ridiculous, and the Japanese people do not believe them. Therefore, the conservative parties have recently restrained themselves slightly and do not mention them much. When we are present at meetings, even fewer people directly say that China and the Soviet Union are invading. But they often say this when campaigning alone in rural areas. Recently, they have spread the argument that because Japan has no army, even South Korea is invading us. The Japanese territory of Takeshima (Dokdo) was occupied by it, and the so-called Rhee Line was drawn, and Japanese fishermen were arrested by the Korean army. Takeshima has been Japanese territory for thousands of years, but South Korea occupied it and even issued stamps. In short, everything is because Japan has no army. They use this argument to deceive the people.

If the US-Japan Security Treaty was indeed signed to deal with foreign aggression, then South Korea is also a foreign country. Why doesn't the United States oppose it? On the contrary, the fortress on Takeshima was built by Americans. Everything South Korea does is done with the tacit approval of the United States. The purpose of the conservative parties' argument is only to suppress pacifists and expand the market for warmongers. The Japanese people should be vigilant and not be deceived by them. Secondly, I would like to talk about how the conservative forces want to distort the interpretation of the constitution, create a fait accompli through administrative means, so that the constitution will one day be completely destroyed.

After the Korean War broke out, the United States strongly demanded that the Yoshida government establish an army. Yoshida organized the Police Reserve Force. We questioned this in the Diet, and the government said that this is the police, not the army. We said that this is the army, it is the egg of the army, and it will become a chicken in the future, so we are absolutely opposed to it. At the same time, we also pointed out that this is a violation of the constitution. Later, the Police Reserve Force was further strengthened and became the Security Force; soon it became the Self-Defense Force; the egg did indeed become a chick. We pointed out in the Diet that this was a violation of Article 9 of the constitution, but Yoshida said that this is an army without combat capabilities, so it does not violate the constitution. After the Yoshida Cabinet resigned, the Hatoyama Cabinet further said that this army is not an armed force for aggression, but an armed force for self-defense. Article 9 originally stipulated that war forces are not allowed, but with this interpretation, it becomes permissible to allow war and allow the possession of war forces. They trampled on the spirit of the constitution and actually strengthened the army. Although Article 9 still exists, its content has completely changed. I think this is an act of corruption of the constitution.

In addition to Article 9, they also want to amend the rights related to trade union collective action. They amended the three labor-related laws, hindering the right to organize and the right to collective action. The constitution stipulates the protection of freedom of belief and freedom of thought, but recently the Diet passed the Subversive Activities Prevention Law and two other education decrees, completely destroying freedom of belief and freedom of thought.

Currently in Japan, the struggle against American military bases has become a major event, because the Japanese people have seen through the deceptive faces of the conservative party government and the United States, and expressed anger at the conservative party government's neglect of the constitution.

Currently, struggles against the expansion of American military bases are taking place in various parts of Japan. For example, in Sunagawa Town in Tachikawa near Tokyo, Mt. Oh Takane in Yamagata Prefecture, Mt. Fuji, Itazuke in Fukuoka, Mt. Myogi, Kisarazu in Chiba, Niigata, and other places. The base in Niigata is scheduled to be expanded next year to allow airplanes carrying atomic bombs to take off and land. Currently, the trade union farmers and residents in this area have united to form a huge force.

Regardless of the present or the future, Japan must prevent the amendment and corruption of the constitution. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to rely on the struggle of the Japanese people's strength. The Socialist Party will lead the people to move in this direction and enable them to exert their strength. Japan's movement to uphold the constitution is not limited to the country. It is aimed at Japan's conservative forces and the US imperialism behind them. Therefore, we sincerely hope to get the support and encouragement of the Chinese people.

    日本国民拥护宪法的斗争
    ——在中国人民外交协会发表的讲演（摘要）
    日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团员  猪俣浩三
    日本的保守势力以及代表它的利益的保守党派对现行宪法正采取破坏的行动。保守势力想从两方面进行破坏。一方面是想恶劣地修改宪法，另一方面是想对宪法进行腐蚀，使它从内部腐烂、变质。
    一九五四年十一月，吉田内阁的修改宪法委员会公开发表了一个草案。根据那个草案来看，他们主要是想修改第九条，就是规定放弃战争的那一条。草案还提出要恢复天皇元首制度，使天皇有宣战媾和等权力。另外还想恢复封建性的家族制度。
    过去几年中，日本的保守势力和革新势力在是否要修改宪法第九条，使日本重新武装问题上，进行了尖锐的斗争。
    保守党派的论调有各种各样，归纳起来，主要有下列几点：
    一个论调是，日本的宪法原是美国强迫日本接受的。现在日本已独立，日本的根本法应由日本人自己来制定。这个说法的目的是想利用日本人民要求独立的感情来进行欺骗。我们彻底反驳了这种论调。
    我经常代表社会党在广播座谈会和各党派的竞选会上，这样驳斥他们的：既然认为日本宪法是美国强迫日本接受的，保守党派为什么不提出废除一九五一年的旧金山和约和安全条约呢？全世界都知道这些条约是美国强迫日本签订的。旧金山和约签字的当天下午，当日本国会还没有通过的时候，美国就把吉田茂带到旧金山一个美国兵营的房间里，签了安全条约。安全条约虽然只有五条，但已把日本完全掠夺。大家知道，日本帝国主义横行不法的时候，曾占领了中国的东北。日本军阀和伪满洲国订有日满议定书，也只有三四条，其内容和目前的安全条约几乎是活生生的翻版。日本有句俗话“自食其果”，过去它在东北的所作所为，目前美国正在日本如法泡制。根据美日安全条约和行政协定，美国在日本建立了七三三个军事基地。日本人不许入内的军事基地总面积，相当于四国岛那么大。保守党派说日本宪法是由美国强迫它接受的，而对如此明显地丧权辱国的条约却一字不提，分明是对人民进行欺骗。
    美国曾多次要日本历届内阁修改宪法，要日本建立军队，现在内阁的做法也只是满足美国的要求而已。
    还有一种论调说，和约生效以后，日本已独立，独立国应有军队。这个论调也不恰当。日本没有成为独立国，如日本在目前情况下建立军队，这些军队就会变成美国的雇佣兵，使日本人变为美国的炮灰。
    还有一种说法是，中国已是共产主义的大国，日本国内共产党的发展也很快，日共很可能在中共帮助之下进行暴力革命，那时单有警察就对付不了。另外，日本有朝鲜人六十万人，都是比较激进的，如果和共产党一起搞革命，单有警察也对付不了，因此，日本必须有军队。关于苏联、中国要侵略日本的言论，实在太可笑，日本人民也都不相信，因此保守党派最近也稍收敛，不大提了。开会时有我们在场，正面说中苏侵略的人更少。但在农村中单独竞选的时候，还常说这种话。最近又散布这样的论调说，因为日本没有军队，连韩国也来侵略我们。日本的领土竹岛被它占去，又划了什么李承晚线，日本渔民被韩军抓去。竹岛几千年来是日本的领土，韩国占了去，甚至还发行了邮票。总之，一切的事情都是因为日本没有军队。他们就用这种论调来欺骗人民。
    如果美日安全条约确是为了对付外国侵略而订的，那末韩国也是外国，美国为什么不反对它。相反的，竹岛上的炮台还是美国人建立的。韩国的一切作为都是在美国的默许下做的。保守党派的论调，目的只是在压制和平论者，使战争论者的市场扩大。日本人民应加警惕，不要受其蒙蔽。其次，我想谈一谈保守势力想怎样歪曲解释宪法，用行政手段造成既成事实，使宪法有一天会被完全破坏。
    朝鲜战争发生以后，美国就强烈要求吉田政府建立军队。吉田组织了警察后备队。我们在国会提出质询，政府就说，这是警察，不是军队，我们说这就是军队，是军队的卵，将来会变成鸡的，因此我们绝对反对。同时，我们又提出说，这是违反宪法的。后来警察后备队进一步加强变为保安队；不久又变为自卫队；卵果然变成了小鸡。我们在国会指出，这是违反宪法第九条的行为，而吉田却说，这是不具战力的军队，因此不违反宪法。吉田内阁辞职以后，鸠山内阁又进一步说，这个军队不是侵略的武装，是自卫的武装。第九条原规定不许有战争力量，这样解释，就成了可以允许战争，允许保有战争力量了。他们蹂躏了宪法的精神，实际上增强了军队。第九条虽然仍存在，内容却全变了。我认为这就是对宪法的腐蚀行为。
    除了第九条外，他们还要修改有关工会集体行动的权利。他们修改了有关劳动的三个法案，使团结权和集体行动权受到妨碍。宪法规定保障信仰自由和思想自由，但最近国会通过了防止破坏活动法和其他两个教育法令，完全破坏了信仰自由和思想自由。
    目前在日本，反对美国军事基地的斗争已成为很大的事件，因为日本人已看穿了保守党政府和美国的欺骗面目，对保守党政府玩忽宪法的行为表示愤怒。
    现在日本各地正在进行反对扩大美国军事基地的斗争。例如在东京附近立川的砂川町、山形县的大高根、富士山、福冈的板付、妙义山、千叶的木更津、新潟等地，都在展开。新潟的基地，明年要扩大，使飞机场能起落装有原子弹的飞机。目前这个地方的工会农民和居民已联合起来，形成了一个巨大的力量。
    不论目前和今后，日本一定要防止对宪法的修改和腐蚀。为达到此目的，须依靠日本人民力量的斗争。社会党要领导人民向这个方向前进，使他们发挥出他们的力量。日本的拥护宪法运动不限于国内，它是针对日本的保守势力及其背后的美帝国主义的，因此衷心希望能得到中国人民的支持和鼓励。
