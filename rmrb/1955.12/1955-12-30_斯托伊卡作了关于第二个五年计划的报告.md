Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 27th: At the evening session of the Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party on December 26th, Stoica, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, delivered a report on the Second Party Congress's directives for the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy from 1956 to 1960.

    Speaking about the industrial tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, Stoica pointed out that according to the draft directives, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, Romania's industrial output must increase by 65 percent, so that by the end of this plan, the country's industrial output would increase to 5.4 to 5.6 times that of 1948, and 4.6 to 4.8 times that of 1938. In order to continue to steadfastly implement the policy of national socialist industrialization, it is stipulated that the output of means of production should increase by an average of 11 to 11.5 percent annually, while the output of consumer goods should increase by an average of 8.5 to 9 percent annually.

    Stoica said that the draft directives stipulate that crude oil production will increase by 28 percent, so that the annual output in 1960 will be 13.5 million tons. Coal production in 1960 will increase by 80 to 90 percent compared to 1955. Natural gas production is to be increased to 2.6 times, that is, at least 10 billion cubic meters should be produced annually by 1960. In the coming years, the electrification of the country will continue with greater force.

    Stoica continued, saying that the draft directives stipulate vigorous development of metal production. By 1960, pig iron production will approximately double that of 1955; steel production will increase by two to 2.2 times, and steel product output will almost double. Iron ore production will increase by 1.8 to 2 times. Copper production will increase by 1.8 to 2 times.

    The reporter spoke about the necessity of constantly developing the machine manufacturing industry, pointing out that according to the draft directives, by 1960, the production of this sector will increase to 1.8 to 2 times that of 1955. Stoica added that our country possesses all the prerequisites for the comprehensive development of the chemical industry. The Party intends to formulate a comprehensive plan for the development of the chemical industry for a period of ten to fifteen years in the future. The draft directives stipulate that the total output of the chemical industry should be increased by 1.5 to 2 times. In order to ensure the large-scale construction stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, cement production will increase by about 80 percent, reaching more than 3.5 million tons in 1960.

    The rapid development of heavy industry and agriculture according to the Second Five-Year Plan will inevitably provide a solid foundation for the development of the consumer goods industry. The draft directives stipulate that the output of light industry and the food industry in 1960 will increase by 150 percent compared to 1955.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the output of local industries will increase by 45 to 50 percent, and the output of handicraft cooperatives will increase by 50 to 55 percent. In order to meet the growing needs of the national economy for raw materials and fuel resources during the period from 1956 to 1960, the draft directives stipulate that the amount of geological exploration will increase by 80 percent compared to the first five-year plan period.

    Stoica then spoke about the agricultural tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: The general task of agriculture in the Second Five-Year Plan is to ensure a significant increase in the production of marketable agricultural products, a large part of which should be obtained from the socialist component of agriculture. It is stipulated that by 1960, grain production should reach 15 million tons, of which wheat and rye should be no less than 5.5 million tons. Considering the great significance of corn, its sown area will increase to 4 million hectares by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, and the total harvest of corn will reach 8 million to 9 million tons.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan, special attention is paid to increasing the number of livestock, especially the growth of livestock product productivity.

    The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that the number of machine tractor stations will reach 380 in 1960, and the technical equipment of the machine tractor stations will be increased with tractors and other agricultural machinery.

    After describing the tasks of transportation and trade during the Second Five-Year Plan period, Stoica also talked about the allocation of investment to various departments. He pointed out: During the Second Five-Year Plan period, industrial investment accounted for 56 percent of the total investment, of which industries producing means of production accounted for 50 percent, and consumer goods industries accounted for 6 percent. This reflects the Party's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry.

    Stoica concluded by saying: The enthusiastic patriotism and labor upsurge of our hardworking and creative people, the wise leadership of the Party, the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the friendly economic cooperation with socialist countries, and the development of economic ties with all peace-loving countries are all guarantees for the realization of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    斯托伊卡作了关于第二个五年计划的报告
    据新华社讯据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十七日讯：在罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会二十六日晚间会议上，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员、罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡作了关于第二次党代表大会对一九五六年至一九六零年发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的指示的报告。
    斯托伊卡在谈到第二个五年计划在工业方面的任务时指出，根据指示草案的规定，在第二个五年计划期间，罗马尼亚工业产量必须增加百分之六十五，以便到这个计划结束的时候，国家的工业产量增加到一九四八年的五点四倍到五点六倍，而为一九三八年的四点六到四点八倍。为了继续坚定地执行国家社会主义工业化的政策，规定生产资料产量每年平均增加百分之十一至十一点五，而消费品产量则每年平均增加百分之八点五到九。
    斯托伊卡说，指示草案规定，原油产量将增加百分之二十八，这样，一九六零年年产量将是一千三百五十万吨。一九六零年煤的产量比一九五五年增加百分之八十到九十。天然气的产量要增加到二点六倍，即到一九六零年每年至少应该生产一百亿立方公尺。在今后的年代中将以更大的力量来继续进行国家的电气化。
    斯托伊卡接着说，指示草案规定大力发展金属生产。到一九六零年，生铁的产量大约将增加到一九五五年的两倍；钢产量将增加到二倍到二点二倍，钢材产量差不多要增加一倍。铁矿砂的产量将增加到一点八倍到两倍。铜的生产量将增加到一点八倍到两倍。
    报告人谈到不断发展机器制造工业的必要性时指出，根据指示草案的规定，到一九六零年，这一部门的生产将增加到一九五五年的一点八倍到两倍。斯托伊卡又说，我们国家拥有全面发展化学工业的一切先决条件。党打算将来拟订一项为期十年到十五年的化学工业发展的综合计划。指示草案规定把化学工业的总生产量增加一倍半到两倍。为了保证第二个五年计划规定的大规模建设，水泥产量将增加百分之八十左右，一九六零年将达到三百五十多万吨。
    重工业和农业按照第二个五年计划的迅速发展必然为消费品工业的发展提供坚实的基础。指示草案规定，一九六零年轻工业和食品工业的产量比一九五五年增加百分之一百五十。
    在第二个五年计划期间，地方工业的产量将增加百分之四十五到五十，手工业合作社的产量将增加百分之五十到五十五。为了满足一九五六年到一九六零年期间国民经济对于原料和燃料资源的日益增长的需要，指示草案规定地质的勘察量比第一个五年计划期间增加百分之八十。
    斯托伊卡接着谈到第二个五年计划在农业方面的任务。他说：农业在第二个五年计划中的总任务是，保证大大提高商品农产品的生产，其中很大一部分应当从农业的社会主义成份中取得。规定到一九六零年谷物的生产要达到一千五百万吨，其中小麦和黑麦要不少于五百五十万吨。由于考虑到玉蜀黍有重大的意义，它的播种面积到第二个五年计划结束的时候将增加到四百万公顷，而玉蜀黍的总收获量将达到八百万到九百万吨。
    在第二个五年计划中特别重视增加牲畜的头数，特别是牲畜产品生产率的增长。
    第二个五年计划规定一九六零年机器拖拉机站的数目要达到三百八十个，并且以拖拉机和其他农业机器来增加机器拖拉机站的技术装备。
    斯托伊卡在叙述了第二个五年计划期间交通运输业和贸易方面的任务后，还谈到对各部门投资的分配的情形。他指出：第二个五年计划期间，工业投资占总投资的百分之五十六，其中生产生产资料的工业占百分之五十，消费品工业占百分之六。这反映出党优先发展重工业的政策。
    斯托伊卡最后说：勤劳和富有创造力的我国人民的热情的爱国主义和劳动高涨、党的英明领导、苏联的兄弟帮助、同社会主义阵营各国在经济上的友好合作、同一切爱好和平国家的经济联系的发展，这一切就是实现第二个五年计划的保证。
