    Stop This Criminal Behavior Towards State Property

    To the Editor:

    Among the scrap materials sold by the Suihua Materials Factory of the Qiqihar Railway Administration, there are a large number of usable items. For example, among the "scrap iron" bought back by the Suihua Locomotive Depot from the Materials Factory, there was a fully functional locomotive generator worth 1,263 yuan, as well as two DC motors that could be used after repair. In the materials that the Second Engineering Team bought back as "scrap iron," there were two jacks worth 572 yuan and weighing 15 tons, two portable telephones worth 200 yuan, sixteen wire tighteners worth 93 yuan, as well as a large number of usable materials such as kerosene lamps, gasoline lamps, iron wire, and nuts. The electrical materials bought back by the Telecommunications Section from the Materials Factory's "scrap pile" were more than 60 percent usable.

    In order to quickly dispose of this batch of "scrap materials," the Materials Factory sometimes even adopted the method of "free giveaways." For example, when the Telecommunications Section bought 200 insulator rods from the Materials Factory, the Materials Factory "gave away" another 300 rods for free; when the Second Engineering Team bought back "500 kilograms" of waste asphalt from the Materials Factory, they actually sifted out 1,500 kilograms of good asphalt.

    The Materials Factory's irresponsible attitude towards state property has been consistent. As early as September 1954, the leading personnel and materials management personnel of the Materials Factory began to take illegal measures to "eliminate the scrap material warehouse." Hou Zhanying, the deputy director, once instructed the warehouse keeper, Liu Hongkui, to dispose of more than 300 kinds of usable plumbing and electrical materials as scrap. In order to "dispose" of them thoroughly, they buried a total of more than 30 kinds of materials such as asbestos packing and natural mica in the soil, sold two large boxes of light bulbs and more than a thousand pieces of signal light glass worth 1,470 yuan as broken glass, and burned more than 30,000 wooden door handles and thousands of hand signal flagpoles as waste wood. After they "disposed" of the "scrap pile" in this way, in order to evade responsibility, they destroyed all the material cards as well. Therefore, it is now impossible to calculate how much damage this Materials Factory has caused to the state.

    The Suihua Materials Factory's practice of arbitrarily wasting state property should be regarded as a criminal act. The relevant leading authorities should investigate and seriously deal with this matter.

### 制止这种对待国家物资的犯罪行为

    制止这种对待国家物资的犯罪行为编辑同志：
    在齐齐哈尔铁路管理局绥化材料厂出卖的废料中，有着大批可以利用的器材。例如，绥化机务段从材料厂买回去的“废铁”中，有着一台完全能够使用的、价值一千二百六十三元的机车发电机，还有两台经过修理以后就能够使用的直流电动机。第二工程队当做“废铁”买回去的材料中，有价值五百七十二元、重十五吨的千斤顶两台，价值二百元的携带电话机两台，价值九十三元的紧线器十六个，还有石油灯、汽灯、铁丝、螺丝帽等大批可以利用的材料。电务段从材料厂“废料堆”里买回的电气材料，可用程度在百分之六十以上。
    材料厂为了迅速处理这批“废料”，有时还采取“免费赠送”的办法。如电务段在材料厂买了二百根隔离棒，材料厂就另外“免费赠送”了三百根；第二工程队在材料厂买回了“五百公斤”废沥青，结果在里面竟筛出了一千五百公斤好沥青。
    材料厂这种对待国家财产的不负责任态度是一贯的。早在一九五四年九月，材料厂领导人员和材料管理人员就开始采取非法手段来“消灭废料库”。副厂长侯占营曾指示管库员刘鸿奎把三百多种可用的水暖器材和电气材料等都作为废料处理。为了“处理”的彻底，他们把石绵盘根、天然云母等共三十多种材料埋在土里，把价值一千四百七十元的两大箱子灯泡和一千多块信号色灯玻璃当做碎玻璃卖掉，把三万多个木门拉手和上千根手信号旗杆当废木材烧掉。他们这样“处理”了“废料堆”以后，为了逃避责任，就把全部材料卡片也都毁掉了。因此，这个材料厂究竟给国家造成了多么大的损失，现在都无法统计。
    绥化材料厂这种任意糟蹋国家财产的做法，应该被认为是一种犯罪行为。有关领导机关应当检查并且严肃处理这件事。
