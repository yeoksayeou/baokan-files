The busy winter transportation has made Yichang Port even more prosperous.

Yichang Port, known as the throat of Sichuan and Hubei, has seen its winter transshipment task increase by 71.93% compared to the first quarter of this year, equivalent to the total transshipment volume for the entire year of 1953.

On the wharves of Yichang Port, from dawn to late at night, it is filled with the noise of loading and unloading cargo. Three belt conveyors are turning rapidly. Among the transported materials are steel billets, steel plates, pig iron, and ores transferred from Shanghai, Anshan, Nanjing, Dalian, and Huangshi to the Southwest to support industrial construction, as well as a wide variety of daily necessities transported to the people of various ethnic groups in the Southwest. From the Southwest, a lot of rice and tea, pickled mustard tuber, medicinal materials, and other various mountain and local products are transported to support industrial construction across the country and supply the needs of the people.

Labor emulation is being carried out here enthusiastically. The ships traveling on the Sichuan River generally implement the transshipment method of changing tugs without changing barges, which accelerates the turnover of transportation tools. The "People No. 1" ship left the port 22 hours ahead of schedule, reducing the docking time in the port. The employees of this ship pioneered the night navigation of the Sichuan River with a "Five" character barge, and in one month, they increased the transportation volume by 3,300 tons for the country. After the opening of night navigation on the Sichuan River, Yichang Port has become a port that never sleeps. The moving lights of the ships on the river and the lighting electric lights on the wharf illuminate the Yichang port in the winter night with colorful lights, making it more beautiful than in previous years.

    不夜的宜昌港
    黄元美
    冬季繁忙的运输，使宜昌港变得更加繁荣了。
    有川鄂咽喉之称的宜昌港，今年冬季的转运任务比第一季度增加了百分之七十一点九三，相当于一九五三年全年的转运总量。
    宜昌港的码头上，从黎明到深夜，充满了装卸货物的喧闹声。三部皮带运输机急剧地在转动。在运输的物资中，有来自上海、鞍山、南京、大连、黄石转运到西南来支援工业建设的钢胚、钢板、生铁、矿石等，还有运给西南各民族人民的种类繁多的日用品。从西南运来了很多大米和茶叶、榨菜、药材等各种山货土产，支援全国各地的工业建设和供应人民的需要。
    劳动竞赛在这里火热地开展了起来。行驶川江的轮船普遍实行了换拖不换驳的转口运输法，加速了运输工具的周转。人民一号轮比预定时间提前二十二小时驶出了港口，减少了港口停泊时间。这个轮船上的职工首创了拖带一只“五”字驳夜航川江，一个月时间，就为国家增加了三千三百吨运输量。开辟川江夜航以后，宜昌港变成了一个不夜的港口，江面轮船上游动的灯光，码头上的照明电灯，把冬夜的宜昌港口照耀得五光十色，比往年更加美丽。
