    The Road to Happiness for the Tibetan People

    December 25th marked the first anniversary of the opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways. On this joyous and inspiring day, we, the Tibetan people, with immense joy and gratitude, express our highest respect to the great Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support and assistance of all fraternal nationalities across the country, especially the comrades of the CPC Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who have modeled the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, religious policies, and the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, earnestly respected the religious beliefs and customs of our Tibetan people, and with a positive, responsible, hard-working, and selfless spirit, enthusiastically helped us build our homeland. In the past four years, in the Rikaze area of Tibet alone, the People's Bank, trade companies, telecommunications bureaus, and agricultural experimental farms have been established, and schools have been founded. What makes our Tibetan people even more grateful is that the Central People's Government has annually issued interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans, water conservancy loans, relief funds, and low-interest industrial and commercial loans in various regions of Tibet. At the same time, the Jiefang New Village was built in the southern district of Rikaze City to accommodate homeless poor people. In particular, the victims of the floods along the Nyang Chu River last year, thanks to the central government's relief efforts, not only survived the disaster but also rebuilt their homes. Through this series of efforts, Tibet's agricultural, pastoral, industrial, commercial, educational, and cultural undertakings have all achieved considerable development, and the people's lives have initially improved.

    Last year's December 25th opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways, and this year's October opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Jiangzi highways, fully demonstrate the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's deep concern and love for us. It is of great significance for the prosperity of Tibet's economy and culture, and for the development of material exchanges between regions. We deeply feel that these highways are a strong guarantee for the happy lives of our Tibetan people. They closely connect the mainland of the motherland with the frontier Tibet, as well as the important towns of Tibet. At the same time, it also strengthens the connection between the Tibetan people and the fraternal nationalities of the motherland. Since the opening of the highways, Rikaze alone has presented a new look: two flat, neat, and wide cross-shaped roads have been built in the urban area; in the state-owned trading company, it is full of industrial and commercial products produced by the motherland to supply the Tibetan people; automobiles have also transported construction materials for new construction projects, and a large number of medicines, medical equipment, and generators for showing movies, and meteorological equipment to the farms; Tibetan local products and specialties have also been sold well. The newly opened Xinhua Bookstore has brought in more than 50,000 books and picture albums, and our Tibetan people can also buy Tibetan books and picture albums. The newly established People's Hospital in the southern district of the city has ten departments, including internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, X-ray, and surgery, and also has inpatient beds, and has organized mobile medical teams and vaccination teams to go to the countryside for treatment. We feel that this is a further step in the warmth of the motherland's big family under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.

    This year, in March, the State Council's decision on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and other matters to help the construction of Tibet further laid the foundation for building a new Tibet, and will make the unity of Tibetan monks and lay officials and Tibetan people and all comrades in Tibet more intimate and consolidated. The facts of the past six months have proved that the opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Jiangzi highways, and the establishment of the Preparatory Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, are all manifestations of the active implementation of the State Council's resolutions. Due to the convenience of transportation, many Tibetan officials and young men and women in the Rikaze area alone have visited and studied in the mainland. At the same time, the central government has also sent many technical cadres to help build Tibet. For example, the Tibet Engineering Survey Team, after several months of hard work, has now basically completed the survey and design of flood control, thermal power plants, and other projects in Rikaze City, and has conducted a general survey of the water resources of the Nyang Chu River, providing new conditions for the future development of farmland water conservancy.

    Through these concrete facts, we deeply appreciate the warmth and loveliness of the united, friendly, and cooperative motherland's big family, and we see even more clearly the bright future of our Tibetan people. Therefore, we will be more confident in creating our own happy lives. In the past, due to the enslavement by imperialism and the discrimination and exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, our Tibetan people have long been in a state of poverty and backwardness. Now, the lives of our Tibetan people cannot be as good as the lives of the people in the mainland immediately. The facts of a few years have proved that if we want to live a happy and fulfilling life, we must follow the Communist Party more closely and follow Chairman Mao. In this way, our Tibetan people can get rid of poverty and move towards a prosperous and happy life. In the future, we, the Tibetan people, will resolutely advance under the correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, with the help of the exemplary actions of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and all working cadres, and in accordance with the direction and path indicated by the Constitution, to further consolidate unity with practical actions, help each other, learn from each other, strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces, actively prepare for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and strive to build a new Tibet of the motherland.

    西藏人民幸福的道路
    班禅额尔德尼
    十二月二十五日是康藏、青藏两条公路通车一周年纪念日。在这个欢欣鼓舞的日子里，我们西藏人民都以万分高兴而感激的心情，向伟大的中国共产党和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，表示崇高的敬意。
    西藏和平解放以来，西藏人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，以及全国各兄弟民族的大力支援和帮助下，特别是中共西藏工委和中国人民解放军西藏军区的全体同志们模范地执行了毛主席的民族政策、宗教政策和和平解放西藏办法的协议，认真尊重了我们藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，并以积极负责吃苦耐劳的伟大精神，热诚地帮助我们建设家乡。四年多来，在西藏仅就日喀则地区来说，先后建立了人民银行、贸易公司、电讯局、农业试验场，创办了学校；更使我们藏族人民感激的是中央人民政府每年都在西藏各个地区发放了无利息的农牧业贷款、水利贷款、救济款和工商业低利贷款；同时还在日喀则市南区修建了解放新村，收容了无家可归的穷苦人民去居住，尤其是去年年楚河两岸遭了水灾的灾民，由于中央的救济，使灾民不仅度过了灾荒时期，并重建了自己的家园。通过这一系列的工作，从而使西藏的农牧工商业、教育文化事业都得到了相当的发展，人民的生活初步得到了改善。
    去年十二月二十五日康藏、青藏两条公路的通车，今年十月拉日、日江公路的通车，都充分说明中共中央和国务院对我们的亲切关怀和热爱，它对繁荣西藏的经济文化、开展各地区间的物资交流，都有着重大的意义。我们深深感到，这几条公路，是我们藏族人民幸福生活的有力保证，它把祖国内地和边疆的西藏以及西藏各重要城镇，都紧密地连接起来了；同时，也更加密切了西藏人民和祖国各兄弟民族的联系。通车以来，仅就日喀则来说，市面呈现着一片新的气象：在市区修筑了十字形的两条平坦的马路整齐宽阔；在国营贸易公司里，摆满了祖国出产的工商品供应藏族人民；汽车还给新建工程运来了建筑器材，和大批的药品、医疗器械和放电影用的发电机，还给农场运来了气象设备；西藏的土产、特产也得到了畅销。最近开设的新华书店，运来了五万多册书籍和画报，我们藏族人民也可以买到藏文的书籍和画报。在市南区新成立的人民医院，设有内外科、妇产科、小儿科、爱克斯光科、手术科等十科，还设有住院病床，并组织了巡回医疗组和种痘组，下乡进行治疗。我们感到，这是我们藏族人民在毛主席民族政策光辉照耀下更进一步地得到了祖国大家庭的温暖。
    今年三月间，国务院关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会及其他帮助西藏建设事项等决定，更进一步奠定了建设新西藏的基础，并将使西藏僧俗官员及藏族人民和在西藏的全体同志的团结更加亲密巩固。半年来的事实证明，拉日、日江两条公路的通车，自治区筹备委员会筹备处的成立，都是对国务院决议积极执行的表现。由于交通的方便，仅日喀则地区就有许多藏族官员和青年男女到内地参观学习，同时中央还派来了许多技术干部，来帮助西藏建设，例如：西藏工程勘察队，经过了几个月的辛勤勘察，现在基本上完成了日喀则市防洪、火力发电站等工程的勘察和设计，并普查了年楚河的水利资源，为将来发展农田水利等提供了新的条件。
    通过这些具体事实，我们深刻地体会到各族人民团结友爱合作的祖国大家庭的温暖和可爱，更显明的看到了我们西藏人民幸福的远景，从而将更加信心百倍地创造自己的幸福生活。过去由于帝国主义的奴役和国民党反动派的歧视剥削，使我们西藏人民长期处于贫困和落后的状态，现在我们西藏人民的生活，马上还不能和内地人民的生活一样的好起来，几年事实证明，我们要想过着幸福美满的生活，只有更紧密地跟着共产党走，跟着毛主席走，这样，我们藏族人民才能摆脱贫困，走向繁荣幸福的生活道路。今后我们西藏人民坚决在伟大领袖毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在进藏人民解放军和全体工作干部模范行动的帮助下，遵照宪法所指示的方向和道路迈进，以实际行动更进一步巩固团结，互相帮助，互相学习，加强反帝爱国力量，积极做好西藏自治区筹备工作，为建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗。（新华社）
