    Accelerating the Mastery of New Technology
    Wang Guanchao, Director of Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory
    The period from when a new factory begins production until its production level reaches the design requirements is called the period of mastering new technology (some also call it mastering new production). The shorter this period, the better.

    Before National Day this year, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory completed the first phase of its new technology mastery plan one quarter ahead of schedule. By the end of September, a total of 232 new products had been successfully manufactured. By November 5th, the annual plan was completed 56 days ahead of schedule, creating conditions for fully achieving the design targets half a year ahead of schedule and gradually expanding the variety and output of measuring and cutting tools.

    The main reason why the first phase of the new technology mastery plan was completed one quarter ahead of schedule was that, under the correct leadership of the Party, we comprehensively learned from the Soviet Union, implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and overcame various difficulties, especially the difficulties in learning new technologies.

    A large number of workers and technicians in our factory were transferred from brother factories only when the factory was about to be completed. The design stipulated that the average technical grade of workers should be 4.5, but in reality, it was only 2.97, and many specialized technical jobs were not available. According to the design, there should be more than 100 engineering and technical personnel, but in reality, there were only 11. It is imaginable how difficult it is to use workers and technicians with such low technical levels to master a modern factory equipped with the latest Soviet scientific and technological achievements, to operate precision, complex, automated and semi-automated machine tools, and to manufacture precision and high-quality products. There was a printer in the milling cutter workshop. Experienced foremen and senior skilled workers worked on it for a long time, but the products produced were punctured as soon as they were printed, and no numbers could be printed. Technicians and engineers did not know the reason. Finally, it was adjusted by Soviet experts. The main shaft of the semi-automatic lathe for turning the outer circle of the drill bit in the drill bit workshop was reversed, but the workers used to operate the forward rotation, so everyone tried for more than a month and still couldn't adjust it well. As a result, it was adjusted under the guidance of Soviet experts.

    The printer and the semi-automatic lathe for drill bits are only the two simplest of many special machine tools. More complex and precise equipment, such as multi-spindle automatic lathes, semi-automatic special milling machines, and some devices in the air conditioning system, were personally operated and adjusted by Soviet experts. It took several months for some senior technicians to learn how to use them. As for trial-producing products according to the design, the difficulties were even greater. The first batch of 20 mm diameter taper shank drill bits were only preliminarily successfully trial-produced after repeated manufacturing for three or four months.

      This situation requires us to mobilize all employees and technical personnel to quickly improve their skills and master the technology. To achieve this, we first started to formulate a plan for mastering new technologies. It is a comprehensive plan for training and cultivating technical personnel, improving technical strength, in-depth learning of advanced Soviet designs, and gradually mastering the design through practice. It is also an action program for all employees to strive to maximize the effectiveness of equipment in the shortest possible time, so that production can fully meet the Soviet design targets. Therefore, this plan should not be conservative or rash. If it is conservative, it will prolong the time to fully master the new technology. If it is rash, it will be a case of "biting off more than you can chew" and "more haste, less speed." In order to make the plan well, we selected 232 products that were representative in terms of technology from thousands of specifications of products as experiments, and carried out trial production step by step in accordance with strict process regulations, from simple to complex. As long as the technology of these two hundred or so products is mastered, the technology of more than two thousand specifications of products can also be mastered.

    After having a practical plan, effective measures must be taken in political work, technical work, and economic work in order to achieve the plan on schedule or ahead of schedule. In the process of mastering the new technology plan, our factory mainly adopted the following measures:

    The first is to firmly and clearly implement the policy of civilized production. Socialist industrial construction requires us to adopt the latest technological achievements and to act in accordance with regulations. What are "regulations"? These are the advanced technological procedures of the Soviet design. These process regulations are technical documents extracted from the actual experience of Soviet science and technology and the tool manufacturing industry for more than 30 years. They are the most technically advanced and economically reasonable product processing methods. Mastering process regulations is an important part of mastering new technology. Therefore, from the very beginning, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we firmly grasped this link, insisted on implementing process regulations, and fought against all repair habits. For example, the lathe operator of the semi-automatic lathe in the drill bit workshop used to use calipers to check the diameter of the processed object when working in the old factory. Checking with calipers cannot guarantee product quality. The new process regulations stipulate that a micrometer should be used to measure, but the workers find it troublesome and hide a small caliper in their pockets for use at any time. For example, the regular inspection system of instruments is originally to ensure that workers can often use qualified measuring tools, so as to ensure the quality of each process. However, not only do the workers not strictly implement it, but also some workshop leaders are unwilling to strictly implement it. At the beginning of production, it was very common to not strictly inspect the quality of raw materials, reverse the process, and misuse equipment and tools. In response to this, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education and technical education, we also organized construction personnel to go to the workshop to specifically help the workers, and administrative leaders personally conducted inspections. We stipulated that the modification of process regulations must be approved, so that the habit of not following process regulations was gradually overcome. In the manufacture of tooling and the trial manufacture of new products, it should also be carried out in accordance with the manufacturing procedures and quality standards, and must not be sloppy. At first, we did not pay enough attention to the manufacture of tooling. Some molds and fixtures were put into the warehouse without being inspected by the construction section, tool section, and relevant workshops. As a result, it was found that they were not suitable when they were used, causing great rework waste and affecting production. After we stipulated that the manufacture of tooling should also be carried out in accordance with design regulations, the situation gradually improved.

    Secondly, we must quickly master the advanced Soviet designs and the technical experience of Soviet experts. To this end, our engineering and technical personnel, workers and management personnel must humbly and diligently learn advanced Soviet science and technology and resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. In this regard, in addition to selecting some outstanding foremen and technical personnel to directly follow various professional experts to learn, we also organized dozens of professional training courses according to the expertise of Soviet experts, and Soviet experts personally taught them. Those who participated in the training courses included leading staff members and ordinary workers, totaling more than 400 people. In terms of mastering design data, we organized the main leaders of the factory to learn in a planned and systematic way, and organized the main technical personnel to conduct special technical research regularly. In order to achieve comprehensive improvement, we also held various training courses. We first transferred foremen and senior skilled workers from various workshops to study, invited experts to teach, and after learning, they returned to the workshop to teach ordinary workers. Since the beginning of this year, according to the instructions of the superior administrative leading organs, under the direct leadership of the Party committee, we have launched a technology learning movement throughout the factory, so that all technical workers and most of the professional management personnel have received learning training in different forms. Recently, we have also held various regular spare-time cultural and technical training classes. After a year of efforts, the average technical level of technical workers in the factory has increased by more than half a level, and some excellent workers have also been promoted to super grades. The technical jobs that did not exist in the past have now all grown up.

    The third is to improve technical supply work. Technical supply is a prerequisite for production. Without accurate technical data, production preparation cannot be carried out. Especially during the period when a new factory masters new technology, how to be familiar with and master various technical documents and correctly implement them is even more important. At first, we did not do well enough in this regard, which caused many mistakes. For example, the supply of raw materials and tooling was not timely, and the quality was low. From June last year to March this year, most of the new technology mastery plan could not be completed on schedule because the technical supply was not timely. Over the past year, due to our strengthening the planning of technical supply work, striving to obtain the cooperation of domestic steel mills, and organizing various production workshops to make tooling by themselves, we gradually overcame the difficulties in the supply of tool materials and basically ensured the needs of mastering new technologies.

    Our factory has ended the stage of mastering basic process technologies. Now it has begun mass production and is striving to fully achieve the design targets. In the past period of work, we have deeply felt that mastering new production and new technology and adhering to civilized production is a struggle between old and new ideas. In this struggle, leading staff members must have firm determination and perseverance, reward the advanced, oppose backward conservatism, and fight against all repair styles. We must patiently educate employees and use various typical examples to prove the benefits of producing in accordance with process regulations and the harm to the country caused by not producing in accordance with process regulations.

    In the entire process of mastering new technology, trial-producing new products is the central link, but the enterprise's planned management must be strengthened accordingly and attention must be paid to economic results. Otherwise, the learned technology cannot be well applied to large-scale production, which will cause waste. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to economic results, and planned management and technical management were also far behind the needs of technological development. In the future, we must comprehensively improve the work in technology, economy, and management.

    Comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union, implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and mobilizing the vast number of employees to carry out labor emulation centered on mastering new technology will be the main link for our factory to strive to reach the Soviet design targets half a year ahead of schedule. Therefore, we will rely on the leadership of the Party and the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to continuously push the labor emulation forward, implement a material reward system and a reasonable wage system to encourage inventions and provide rationalization proposals, and promote advanced experience.

    加速掌握新技术
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂厂长　王观潮
    一个新工厂，从开始转入生产起，到生产水平达到设计要求为止，这一段时间叫做掌握新技术（也有人叫做掌握新生产）时期。这个时期越短越好。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在今年国庆节前夕，提前一个季度完成了第一期掌握新技术计划。到九月底止，共制造成功了二百三十二种新产品；到十一月五日，提前五十六天完成了全年计划；为提前半年全面达到设计指标、逐步扩大量具刃具的品种和产量创造了条件。
    第一期掌握新技术计划所以能够提前一个季度完成，主要是由于我们在党的正确领导下，全面学习苏联，执行苏联专家建议，克服各种困难，特别是克服了学习新技术的困难。
    我们工厂的大批工人和技术人员，是在工厂快建成的时候才从兄弟厂调来的。设计规定工人的平均技术等级是四点五级，实际上只有二点九七级，而且许多特殊技术工种都没有。按设计规定，工程技术人员应该有一百多人，实际只有十一人。以技术水平这样低的工人和技术人员来掌握一个以苏联最新科学技术成就装备起来的现代化工厂，要开动精密、复杂、自动化半自动化的机床，要制造精密的优质的产品，其困难是可以想像的。铣刀车间有一台打印机，有经验的工长、高级熟练工人摆弄了很久，生产出来的产品一经打印就穿洞，打不出号码来。技术员、工程师也不知道原因在哪里，最后是由苏联专家给调整好的。钻头车间车钻头外圆的半自动车床，主轴是反转的，而工人们以前都是操纵正转的，因此大家琢磨了一个多月还调整不好。结果也是在苏联专家指导下才调整好的。
    打印机和钻头半自动车床仅仅是许多特殊机床中最简单的两种，比它们更复杂、更精密的设备，如多轴自动车床、半自动的专用铣床以及空气调节系统中的一些装置等，都是经过苏联专家亲自操纵调整，历时好几个月，一些高级技工才学会使用。至于按照设计试制产品，困难就更多。头一批二十公厘直径的斜柄钻头，经过三、四个月的反复制造才初步试制成功。
      这种情况要求我们必须动员全体职工和技术人员迅速提高技术，掌握技术。为了做到这一点，我们首先着手编制了掌握新技术计划。它是全面训练和培养技术人员、提高技术力量、深入学习苏联先进设计，并且通过实践逐步掌握设计的计划；它也是全体职工争取在最短时间内为最大限度地发挥设备效能，使生产全面达到苏联设计指标的行动纲领。因此，这个计划既不能保守，也不能冒进。保守了，就要延长全面掌握新技术的时间；冒进了，就会“贪多嚼不烂”，“欲速则不达”。为了把计划订好，我们在数千种规格的产品里，挑出了二百三十二种在工艺方面具有代表性的产品作为试验，由简到繁，有步骤地按严格的工艺规程进行试生产。只要这二百多种产品的技术都掌握了，二千多种规格的产品的技术也就可以掌握了。
    有了切合实际的计划以后，还要在政治工作、技术工作、经济工作方面采取有效措施，才能使计划按期或者提前实现。我厂在掌握新技术计划的过程中，主要是采取了以下一些措施：
    首先是坚定明确地贯彻执行文明生产的方针。社会主义工业建设要求我们必须采用最新的技术成就，必须一切按照规章办事。什么是“规章”呢？这就是苏联设计的先进工艺规程。这些工艺规程是从苏联三十多年的科学技术和工具制造业的实际经验中提炼出来的技术文件，是在技术上最先进，在经济上最合理的产品加工方法。掌握工艺规程是掌握新技术的重要内容。因此，我们一开始就在苏联专家指导下，紧紧地抓住这一环节，坚持执行工艺规程，跟一切修配习惯作斗争。例如钻头车间半自动车床的车工，在老厂工作的时候，都习惯用卡钳去检查加工物的直径。用卡钳检查不能保证产品质量。新的工艺规程规定要用千分尺去量，但是，工人们嫌麻烦，在衣袋里都藏着一把小卡钳，随手拈来使用。又如仪具的定期检查制度，本来是为保证工人能够经常使用合乎标准的量具，从而保证每道工序的质量。但是，不仅工人不严格执行，某些车间的领导人员也不愿意严格执行。在开始生产的时候，不严格检验原材料质量、颠倒工序、错用设备和工具等现象是很普遍的。对此，我们除加强政治思想教育和技术教育外，还组织施工人员到车间去具体帮助工人，行政领导人员亲自进行检查，规定了修改工艺规程必须经过批准，这样才逐步克服了不按工艺规程办事的习气。在工卡具制造和新产品试制方面，也应该按照制造程序和质量标准进行，不能草率马虎。最初，我们曾对工卡具制造重视不够，某些冲模和卡具不经施工科、工具科及有关车间验收就入了库，结果等到使用时才发现不合用，造成极大的返工浪费，还影响了生产。我们规定工卡具的制造也要按设计规章办事以后，情况才逐渐好转。
    其次，必须迅速把苏联的先进设计和苏联专家的技术经验统统掌握在我们自己的手里。为此，我们的工程技术人员、工人和管理人员就必须虚心地、刻苦地学习苏联先进科学技术，坚决执行苏联专家建议。在这方面，我们除选派了一些优秀的工长、技术人员直接跟随各种专业专家学习外，并且根据苏联专家的专长，分别组织了数十个专业训练班，由苏联专家亲自授课。参加训练班的，有领导工作人员，有一般工人，共四百多人。在掌握设计资料方面，我们组织了工厂主要负责人有计划有系统地学习，组织主要技术人员定期进行专门的技术研究。为了达到全面提高，我们还举办了各种训练班，先抽调各车间的工长、高级熟练工人学习，请专家授课，学好后，就让他们回车间教一般工人。今年以来，我们又根据上级行政领导机关的指示，在党委的直接领导下，在全厂范围内开展了一个学习技术的运动，使全体技术工人和大半的专业管理人员都受到不同形式的学习训练。最近，我们又举办了各种正规的业余文化技术进修班。经过一年来的努力，全厂技术工人的平均技术等级已提高半级以上，某些优秀的工人还有超级晋级的。过去没有的技术工种，现在全部成长起来了。
    第三是改善技术供应工作。技术供应是进行生产的先决条件，没有精确的技术资料就无法进行生产准备。特别是在新厂掌握新技术时期，如何熟悉和掌握各种技术文件并且正确地贯彻执行更为重要。最初，我们在这方面做得是不够好的，曾经造成了很多错误。如供应的原材料和工卡具不及时，质量低劣。从去年六月到今年三月的掌握新技术计划，大部分曾因为技术供应不及时而不能按期完成。一年来，由于我们加强了技术供应工作的计划性，尽力取得国内各钢厂协作，并且组织了各个生产车间自做工卡具，才逐步克服了工具材料供应的困难，基本保证了掌握新技术的需要。
    我们工厂已经结束了掌握基本工艺技术的阶段；现在已经开始成批生产，为全面达到设计指标而努力。在过去一段工作过程中，我们深深地感到掌握新生产新技术，坚持文明生产，是一种新旧思想的斗争。在这个斗争中，领导工作人员必须有坚定的决心和毅力，奖励先进，反对落后保守，跟一切修配作风作斗争。必须耐心地教育职工，用各种典型事例证明按工艺规程进行生产的好处，以及不按工艺规程进行生产给国家造成的危害。
    在掌握新技术的整个过程中，试制新产品是中心环节，但是必须相适应地加强企业的计划管理和注意经济效果。不然，就不能把学到的技术很好地运用到大规模的生产中去，就会造成浪费。过去，我们对经济效果注意不够，计划管理和技术管理也大大落后于技术发展的需要。今后必须全面地提高技术、经济、管理三方面的工作。
    全面学习苏联，执行苏联专家建议，发动广大职工开展以掌握新技术为中心的劳动竞赛，将是我们工厂争取提前半年达到苏联设计指标的主要环节。因此，我们将依靠党的领导和广大职工的积极性，把劳动竞赛不断推向前进，实行物质奖励制度和合理的工资制度，以鼓励创造发明和提供合理化建议，推广先进经验。
