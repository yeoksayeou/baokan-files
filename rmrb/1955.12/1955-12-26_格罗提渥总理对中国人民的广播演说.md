Xinhua News Agency, December 25th:

    German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered the following radio address to the Chinese people today: Dear friends, dear comrades:
    It is with great pleasure that I extend the fraternal fighting greetings of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving Germans to the entire people of the People's Republic of China. It is a great honor to the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to visit the heroic people of the People's Republic. On behalf of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, I express my sincere and deep gratitude to the government and people of the People's Republic of China for their very warm welcome and reception.
    During our visit to your beautiful country, we had the opportunity to meet many outstanding representatives of the Chinese people. We were deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the Chinese working class in building socialist industry. Visiting the Chinese countryside, which is successfully embarking on the road of socialist transformation, left us with an indelible impression.
    Numerous conversations with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army infected us with the strength of the ever-victorious army, and we also saw the determination of every soldier to defend peace with all his might.
    In our contacts with scientists and artists, we deeply understood their extensive cultural work for the benefit of the people and the further development of human intellectual wealth. In universities, we saw a young generation who love the motherland of workers and peasants, are eager to learn and work hard. The delegation members' contact with the Young Pioneers was unforgettable. We met a cheerful young generation nurtured in the spirit of peace and friendship between peoples, who are actively preparing to master China's future.
    We came as friends among friends, and today we can say with great satisfaction that this visit has further consolidated and strengthened our close friendship. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation we signed clearly demonstrates this to the world.
    Our republic, the German Democratic Republic, like your country, is a country of workers and peasants. Our country has thoroughly eradicated militarism and fascism, deprived the monopoly capitalists and landlords, and the working people determine the entire social life.
    The American aggressor groups, in collusion with Adenauer, the Chiang Kai-shek of Germany, have divided Germany. This requires our working people to make even greater efforts to overcome all difficulties. Thanks to the heroism of our working people, and thanks to the support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, we have not only reorganized the economy affected by the division of Germany, but also built our own strong heavy industry.
    The working people of our country are working with great enthusiasm to strengthen our state of workers and peasants. We can tell you with great satisfaction that we have successfully completed the first five-year plan this year, and the second five-year plan with even greater tasks will begin in a few days. Establishing a happy and prosperous life for our working people, consolidating peace, and further strengthening cooperation with other peace-loving people for our common interests are the foundations of our five-year plan. The great Marxist masters, Marx and Engels, were born in Germany. Lenin and Stalin developed their theories and turned them into victorious reality. Now, the German people are realizing these ideas in the German Democratic Republic, and they are building the foundations of socialism.
    The German Democratic Republic is the motherland of all the German people, and it is also a fortress and center in the struggle for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. This fact has caused our common enemy, the imperialists, to roar. Therefore, they try everything possible to slander our republic. They do not hesitate to threaten sovereign states that are seriously considering establishing normal relations with the German Democratic Republic for their own interests and the interests of peaceful coexistence among nations. The fact that the German Democratic Republic, as a peace-loving, democratic, and sovereign state, has gained the respect and recognition of many countries, including such great powers as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, shows how ridiculous the imperialists' attempts are. Just as the German Democratic Republic has gained increasing significance within the national scope, its international influence is also constantly growing.
    The solidarity of the working people of our two countries is also expressed in the struggle against imperialist war-mongers and in the defense of world peace. The imperialist countries have not given up their attempts to reverse the wheels of history. They intend not only to restore the exploitation system hated by the people in Germany, but also in the People's Republic of China, but their various conspiracies are doomed to failure. The question now is no longer when and where the imperialists can seize new positions, but when and where they will lose more positions. We are convinced that Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times, will certainly be liberated from the hands of foreign imperialists and the reactionaries who exploit the Chinese people, and will return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Our solidarity with the national liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples against colonial exploitation and oppression unites us peoples and nations. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly initiated by People's China and India in 1954, have been advancing victoriously throughout the world. This was particularly evident at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung with twenty-nine countries participating. The German Democratic Republic agrees unreservedly with these five principles and supports the liberation struggles of all peoples.
    We welcome the admission of sixteen countries to the United Nations, of which six are Asian countries alone. The time has now come for the People's Republic of China, the largest country in the world, to obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations.
    We are proud of the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples and assure you that the German Democratic Republic is a loyal and reliable friend of the People's Republic of China.
    We are inspired by the enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people in realizing their great tasks under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and we will continue to strengthen the struggle for national unity in Germany. Our two peoples, who are defending peace and building socialism, are in the great and strong world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    We congratulate the People's Republic of China on the achievements it has made so far. We hope you will achieve even greater achievements for the prosperity of the country. We are deeply convinced that just as the Chinese people have victoriously and heroically completed the national liberation struggle in the past, they will surely win victory in the struggle to build socialism in the People's Republic of China.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great, heroic Chinese people!
    Long live the eternal, unbreakable friendship between the German and Chinese people!
    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China!

    格罗提渥总理对中国人民的广播演说
    新华社二十五日讯　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天向中国人民发表广播演说如下：亲爱的朋友们：亲爱的同志们：
    我非常愉快地向中华人民共和国全体人民转致德意志民主共和国劳动人民和所有爱好和平的德国人的兄弟般的战斗敬礼。访问英勇的中华人民共和国人民，是德意志民主共和国政府代表团极大的荣幸。我以德意志民主共和国政府代表团的名义衷心地深切感谢中华人民共和国政府和人民对我们非常热情的欢迎和接待。
    我们在你们美丽的国家访问的时候，有机会接触到中国人民的许多优秀的代表人物。中国工人阶级在建设社会主义工业中的热情使我们深受感动。访问胜利地走着社会主义改造道路的中国农村里，给了我们一个不可磨灭的印象。
    同人民解放军战士的多次谈话，使我们受到常胜军力量的感染，我们还看到每一个战士用全力保卫和平的决心。
    在同科学家和艺术家们的接触中，我们深刻地了解到他们为人民造福和进一步发展人类的思想财富而进行广泛的文化工作。在大学校里，我们看到了热爱工农祖国、好学勤奋的青年一代。代表团员们和少先队员们的接触是永远难忘的。我们认识了以和平和各国人民友好的精神培育起来的愉快的青年一代，他们积极地准备着掌握中国的未来。
    我们以朋友的身份来到了朋友中间，今天我们可以非常满意地说，我们的访问进一步巩固和加强了亲密的友谊。我们签订的友好合作条约，向全世界清楚地表明了这一点。
    我们的共和国——德意志民主共和国，像你们的国家一样，是一个工农的国家。我们国家已经彻底根除了军国主义和法西斯主义，剥夺了垄断资本家和地主，劳动人民决定着整个的社会生活。
    美国侵略集团勾结阿登纳——德国的蒋介石，分裂了德国。这就要求我们劳动人民尽更大的努力克服一切困难。由于我们劳动人民的英勇，由于苏联和各人民民主国家的支援，我们不仅改组了为德国分裂所影响的经济，而且建设了自己的强大的重工业。
    我国的劳动人民，为加强我们工农国家而充满热情地工作着。我们可以非常满意地告诉你们，我们已经在今年胜利完成了第一个五年计划，任务更大的第二个五年计划再过几天就要开始了。建立我国劳动人民的幸福富裕的生活，巩固和平和为了我们共同的利益进一步加强与其他热爱和平的人民的合作，是我们的五年计划的基础。伟大的马克思主义大师——马克思和恩格斯——诞生在德国。列宁和斯大林发展了他们的学说，并且把它变成了胜利的现实。现在，德意志人民在德意志民主共和国实现着这些思想，他们正在建立社会主义的基础。
    德意志民主共和国是德意志全体人民的祖国，同时也是在争取统一、爱好和平和民主的德国的斗争中的堡垒和中心。这一事实引起了我们的共同的敌人——帝国主义者——咆哮。因此它们想尽一切办法来诽谤我们的共和国。他们不惜威胁那些为了自己的利益和各国人民和平共处的利益而认真考虑同德意志民主共和国建立正常关系的主权国家。德意志民主共和国作为一个爱好和平的、民主的、主权国家获得了许多国家的尊重和承认，其中包括苏联和中华人民共和国这样的大国，这个事实说明了帝国主义的企图多么可笑。正如德意志民主共和国在民族的范围内获得了不断增长的意义一样，它的国际影响也在不断地增长。
    我们两国劳动人民的团结也表现在反对帝国主义战争贩子和维护世界和平的斗争中，帝国主义国家没有放弃它们扭转历史车轮的企图。它们不仅打算在德国也打算在中华人民共和国，恢复为人民所痛恨的剥削制度，但是它们的种种阴谋是注定要失败的。现在的问题已经不是帝国主义者在什么时候和在什么地方能够夺取新的阵地，而是在什么时候和在什么地方失去更多的阵地。我们深信，自古以来是中国领土的台湾，一定会从外国帝国主义者和剥削中国人民的反动派的手中解放出来，重新回到祖国的怀抱。
    我们对被压迫的各国人民反对殖民主义剥削和压迫的民族解放斗争的声援，使我们这些人民和国家团结在一起。一九五四年人民中国和印度共同倡议的和平共处的五项原则已经在全世界胜利前进。特别表现在二十九个国家在万隆举行的亚非会议中。德意志民主共和国毫无保留地同意这五项原则并支持各国人民的解放斗争。
    我们欢迎接纳十六个国家加入联合国，其中单是亚洲国家就有六个。世界上最大的国家——中华人民共和国在联合国取得合法地位的时机现在已经到来了。
    我们为我们两国人民牢不可破的友谊感到自豪，并向你们保证：德意志民主共和国是中华人民共和国的忠实可靠的朋友。
    在光荣的中国共产党领导下，中国人民在实现他们伟大任务时所表现的热情鼓舞着我们，我们将继续在德国加强祖国统一的斗争。保卫和平和建设社会主义的我们两国人民同处在以苏联为首的伟大和强盛的世界和平阵营中。
    我们祝贺中华人民共和国迄今所获得的成就。我们希望你们为了国家的富强取得更大的成就。我们深信，正如中国人民过去胜利地、英勇地完成民族解放斗争一样，他们也一定会在中华人民共和国建设社会主义的斗争中获得胜利。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大、英勇的中国人民万岁！
    德中两国人民永恒的，牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国主席，毛泽东同志万岁！
