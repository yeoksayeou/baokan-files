    Twentieth Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and Tenth Anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement
    Capital Universities and Colleges Launch Various Commemorative Activities
    Capital universities and colleges have launched various activities to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and the tenth anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement.

    Many universities and colleges held commemorative meetings. At the commemorative meetings at Tsinghua University and Beijing Normal University, presidents Jiang Nanxiang and Vice-President He Xilin gave reports to the students on the circumstances of these two student movements. At the commemorative meetings at Peking University, Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University, students performed the street play "Put Down Your Whip" from the "December 9th" era, and programs such as "Poetry Recital" reflecting the people's struggles over the past twenty years and the happy life after liberation. Students from the Economics Department and Industrial Economics Department of Renmin University of China held a forum on the topic of the new type of intellectuals. Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University also held photo exhibitions of student movements at their respective schools.

    In order to inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of Chinese students combining with workers and peasants, students from various universities and colleges in the capital have recently established contact with agricultural producers' cooperatives in the suburbs and are helping farmers with production. On average, more than two hundred students from Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and other schools go to the suburbs to help farmers with voluntary labor in their spare time every week. Students from Beijing Railway College picked more than 2,000 jin of cotton for the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative in one day. Students from Beijing Agricultural University also helped farmers learn agricultural techniques. Graduate students from the Beijing Petroleum Institute used the money they saved in a month to buy a double-wheel double-furrow plow and gave it to the newly established Yongjin Agricultural Production Cooperative. Students majoring in radio at Tsinghua University helped farmers install crystal radios. Many universities and colleges will also help farmers establish libraries and help them learn culture.

    “一二·九”运动二十周年和“一二·一”运动十周年
    首都高等学校展开各种纪念活动
    首都高等学校展开各种活动，纪念“一二·九”运动二十周年和“一二·一”运动十周年。
    许多高等学校都举行了纪念会。在清华大学和北京师范大学的纪念大会上，分别由校长蒋南翔、副校长何锡麟给学生作了有关这两次学生运动情况的报告。在北京大学、中国人民大学、清华大学和北京师范大学的纪念会上，学生们演出了在“一二·九”时代的街头剧“放下你的鞭子”，和反映二十年来人民进行斗争的情况以及解放后幸福生活的“诗歌联唱”等节目。中国人民大学经济系、工业经济系的学生曾座谈了关于新型知识分子的问题。北京大学、清华大学和北京师范大学还举办过本校学生运动图片展览。
    为了继承和发扬中国学生同工农相结合的光荣革命传统，首都各高等学校的学生最近同郊区农业生产合作社建立了联系，而且帮助农民生产。清华大学、中国人民大学、北京石油学院等校学生平均每周有二百多人利用课余时间到郊区去帮助农民进行义务劳动。北京铁道学院学生在一天内曾为团结农业生产合作社摘了两千多斤棉花。北京农业大学的学生还帮助农民学习农业技术。北京石油学院的研究生把在一个月中节省下来的钱买了一部双轮双铧犁，送给新成立的永进农业生产合作社。清华大学无线电专业的学生帮助农民装置矿石收音机。许多高等学校还将帮助农民建立图书馆，并且帮助农民学习文化。
