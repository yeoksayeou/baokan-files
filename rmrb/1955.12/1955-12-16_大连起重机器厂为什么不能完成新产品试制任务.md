Why the Dalian Crane Factory Cannot Complete New Product Trial Production Tasks
    Mao Xianzhi

With the development of the nation's construction, the Dalian Crane Factory's new product trial production tasks are increasing. This year alone, it has manufactured more than ten types and twenty specifications of new products, manufacturing thousands of various machines and equipment, supplying the needs of one hundred and eighty factories and mines in twenty-three provinces across the country. While this achievement is not small, it is still far from the requirements of the state. From January to October this year, only one month completed the total output value plan, and only two months completed the total commodity value plan. Among various products, only two could be delivered on time. The number of units urging delivery of orders was twenty-four in July, fifty-one in August, and sixty-nine in September. The Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Administration even sent two people to live in the Dalian Crane Factory for more than one hundred and seventy days to urge delivery. This year, the fines that should be paid for failing to deliver on time are at least 200,000 yuan, of which more than 74,800 yuan alone was paid to the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Administration. As for the losses caused to the ordering units due to the failure to deliver on time, it is impossible to estimate.

Not only that, but the product quality of the Dalian Crane Factory is also very poor. From January to September this year, the factory received a total of two hundred and twenty-three letters criticizing the poor quality of its products. Because of the poor product quality, malfunctions occurred during use, and the factory had to send people to repair them. From January to August this year, seventy-eight people were sent to repair cranes for the ordering units, spending more than 18,000 work hours, equivalent to ninety people not working for twenty-five days, and also spending more than 50,000 yuan on travel and repair expenses. A crane purchased by the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory has not been repaired after three repairs, and now it needs to be completely dismantled and overhauled.

Due to the above reasons, the total product cost of the Dalian Crane Factory exceeded the budget by more than 360,000 yuan in the first half of the year, and the interest on loans alone amounted to more than 100,000 yuan from January to September this year.

The Dalian Crane Factory's new product trial production task this year has increased by nearly double compared to last year, and these new products are single, small-batch, large-scale, complex in structure, and require high quality. Many products are also designed and delivered in the same year. This has indeed added many difficulties to production, for example: new product ordering work is complicated, production technical preparation workload has increased, and production organization management and raw material supply work are also more complicated. However, if the leaders of the Dalian Crane Factory can focus their leadership on several key tasks that determine the success of the entire factory's production according to the new situation, and conscientiously strengthen the planning and organization of enterprise management, then the difficulties can be overcome. Currently, material supply is the weakest link in the Dalian Crane Factory, which often affects the completion of production plans. In October this year, more than forty cranes that were about to be completed could not be put into storage due to the lack of some ordinary materials and accessories. In September this year, because many materials were not purchased until the end of the month, the workshops had to rush to complete the tasks at the end of the month. Are these materials difficult to buy? No. Many materials can be bought within one or two days. Some materials are already in the warehouse, or can be used simply by changing the specifications. They are also not proactive in urging the processing of parts entrusted to other factories. Later, the factory sent a team to other places to urge delivery, and as a result, most of the orders were delivered. This team concluded that if they had gone out half a month earlier, all the goods could have been delivered.

With the increase in new product trial production tasks, the production technical preparation workload will also greatly increase. The factory leaders have long anticipated this situation, but have not seriously addressed it. In fact, the problem is not difficult to solve. First of all, the main product of the Dalian Crane Factory is cranes, which are series products. This provides favorable conditions for the promotion of standard parts within the factory. Standard parts can simplify part specifications and facilitate centralized manufacturing. Therefore, promoting standardization work will greatly reduce the production technical preparation workload. However, the factory has long relaxed this work and only began to pay attention to it in August. This has caused great losses to production.

In terms of the factory's technical strength, it is also possible to complete the technical preparation workload for the current new product trial production. The question is how to organize these technical forces and fully utilize their potential. The Dalian Crane Factory has not done enough in this regard. Last year, when there were not many new product trial production tasks, they established a new product trial production team to lead the new product trial production work. This kind of organization can only adapt to the situation where the task was not large at that time. This year, after the new product trial production task increased substantially, this organization proved to be incapable, so it was canceled. There is nothing wrong with this. The mistake lies in the fact that after the old organization was canceled, the work in this area was not strengthened through the relevant departments, resulting in very weak technical leadership in the new product trial production work. The twenty-ton grab crane should have been delivered in April this year, but the grab welding plan was not decided until June this year. Process regulations are very important for manufacturing new products, but the process regulations compiled by the process department only completed 9% of the plan before August this year, and only 3% of the plan in September. Some products have been basically manufactured, but cannot be put into storage because there is no test run plan and assembly procedure sheet. Errors and omissions in drawings and other technical data and untimely supply are too numerous to mention. In August alone, nearly forty design errors were found in the fitter workshop. In October, due to errors in the drawings made by the design department, more than ten cranes could not be put into storage on time. Due to weak technical guidance during the processing, defective products and technical accidents occurred constantly.

In the face of such complex technical problems as new product trial production, accidents will occur everywhere if technical personnel do not take the initiative to be responsible. The Dalian Crane Factory's organizational leadership of technical forces and political and ideological leadership of technical personnel are very weak. Therefore, the sense of responsibility of some technical personnel is very poor. In the design department, no one reviews and signs the drawings after they are drawn. The drafter sends them up, and the section chief and engineer push them down. Recently, the factory manufactured six gantry cranes for the Jier Line. Before producing this batch of cranes, the users and Soviet experts repeatedly pointed out that these cranes were to be used in areas with cold climates and must be made of cold-resistant killed steel. However, the process department did not specify the need for killed steel when preparing the technical supply plan. As a result, the technical supply department still issued the previously used rimmed steel to the metal structure workshop. After receiving the task, the metal structure workshop technician did not carefully look at the drawings (the drawings stated killed steel) and made two ten-ton cranes and four five-ton cranes out of rimmed steel. It was not until the Soviet experts returned to the factory from other places and repeatedly asked if killed steel was used that it was discovered that rimmed steel was used instead of killed steel. The six cranes originally made of rimmed steel had to be stockpiled. As a result, they could not be delivered on time.

Therefore, the difficulties in production preparation can be overcome by promoting the standardization of parts, simplifying production technical preparation work, organizing the factory's technical forces well, and strengthening the political and ideological leadership of technical personnel to fully mobilize their enthusiasm and initiative.

Due to the large increase in new product tasks, the planning and organization management of production has become more complicated. This requires strengthening plan management, so that all the complex tasks of the factory have a unified plan and arrangement, and the work of various departments is organically linked to ensure the smooth progress of the factory's production. However, the Dalian Crane Factory has long lacked a unified and complete plan. The production progress plan, material supply plan, and production technical preparation plan are not connected with each other, making it impossible for the workshop to produce according to the work plan. In the first half of this year, due to inaccurate work plans, incomplete sets of parts, and poor management of parts, the phenomenon of random discarding and misuse was serious, so that fifty bridge cranes were basically assembled, but could not be put into storage due to the lack of some small parts, while the metal structure workshop blindly produced thirty-two tons of unnecessary parts. The Dalian Crane Factory's plan is only to make up the numbers and is not based on reality. The March plan was supplemented nine times during its implementation, making it impossible for the workshop to produce according to the plan. Moreover, this plan did not include the three ten-ton bridge cranes to be delivered in May, but included the three five-ton cranes to be delivered in July. This situation is also an important reason why the Dalian Crane Factory has long been unable to complete the national plan.

The state's planned economic construction requires the machinery industry to produce more new products. The state encourages and supports units and individuals who actively manufacture new products. However, in practice, the Dalian Crane Factory has not only not rewarded employees and technicians who have made achievements in manufacturing new products, but also has not given them appropriate consideration in the wage system. Many workers often get a lot of overtime wages when producing old products. However, the time quota for new products is very tight, and it is not easy for many workers to get basic wages when trial-producing new products. This will inevitably affect the enthusiasm of employees in trial-producing new products. In the monthly production plan issued to the workshops, the factory not only did not emphasize the importance of new products, but also listed them as "sundries" in the plan (in September, more than ten new products in the metal structure workshop were listed as sundries). Some workshop staff who do not pay attention to new product trial production abandon "sundries" when they see that the output value plan cannot be completed, and rush to produce jobs with large output value and are easy to do. This has caused many important new product plans to be delayed repeatedly. How can the new product trial production task be well completed? Therefore, how to advocate the manufacture of new products and encourage everyone to manufacture new products from all aspects is also a very important task for the Dalian Crane Factory to ensure the completion of the new product trial production task.

    大连起重机器厂为什么不能完成新产品试制任务
    毛先智
    随着国家建设事业的发展，大连起重机器厂的新产品试制任务越来越大了。单是今年，就制造了十多类品种二十多种规格的新产品，制造了数以千计的各种机器设备，供应了全国二十三个省份的一百八十个厂矿企业的需要。这个成绩虽然不算小，但是，距离国家的要求还是很远的。今年一月到十月，只有一个月完成了总产值计划，只有两个月完成了商品总值计划，在各种产品中，只有两种能按期交货。前来催交订货的单位，七月份有二十四个，八月份有五十一个，九月份有六十九个。内蒙古森林工业管理局为了催交订货，竟派了两个人在大连起重机器厂住了一百七十多天。今年由于不能按合同交货而理应支付的罚款至少有二十万元以上，其中仅支付给内蒙古森林工业管理局的就有七万四千八百多元。至于因为不能按期交货给订货单位生产造成的损失，更是无法估计。
    不仅如此，大连起重机器厂的产品质量也是十分低劣的。今年一月到九月，该厂共接到二百二十三封关于批评产品质量不好的来信。因为产品质量低劣，在使用中发生了故障，厂里不得不派人去修理。今年一至八月共派出七十八人前去给订货单位修理吊车，共花费了一万八千多个工时，相当于九十个人二十五天没有干活，还花了出差费、修理费五万多元。沈阳第一机床厂买去的一台吊车，修理三次还没有修好，现在还要大拆大修。
    由于上述原因，大连起重机器厂上半年全部产品成本超支三十六万多元，今年一月至九月份单是信贷利息就支出十多万元。
    大连起重机器厂今年的新产品试制任务比去年增加了将近一倍，而且这些新产品又是单个、小批、大型、结构复杂、质量要求高的，有很多产品还是当年设计、当年交货。这的确给生产上增加了许多困难，例如：新产品订货工作复杂了，生产技术准备工作量增加了，生产的组织管理和原材料供应工作也更加复杂了。但是大连起重机器厂领导上如果能够根据新的情况，把领导重点放在几项决定全厂生产好坏的关键工作上来，认真加强企业管理的计划性和组织性，那末，困难是可以克服的。目前材料供应工作是大连起重机器厂最薄弱的一个环节，经常影响生产计划的完成。今年十月份就有四十多台即将做好的吊车因为缺乏一些普通的材料和配件而不能入库。今年九月份由于很多材料到月底才买来，使得车间不得不在月末突击赶任务。这些材料是不是很难买到呢？不是的。很多材料都是一、二天内就可以买来的。有些材料在库里就有，或者只要把规格改一下就可以使用。委托别厂加工的配件，他们也不积极主动去催。后来工厂派了一个小组到外地催货，结果大部分的订货都催到了。这个小组得出结论说：如果早出去半个月，所有的货都可以催到。
    随着新产品试制任务的加大，生产技术准备工作量也将大大增加，这个情况，厂里领导上也是早已估计到的，但是不认真解决。其实问题也是不难解决的。首先，大连起重机器厂生产的主要产品是起重机，这是系列产品，这对厂内推广标准件提供了有利的条件。标准件可以简化零件规格，便于集中制造。因此推广标准化工作就会使生产技术准备工作量大大减少。然而厂内却长期放松了这一工作，直到八月份才开始重视起来。这就使生产受到很大损失。
    就这个厂的技术力量来说，要完成目前这些新产品试制的技术准备工作量也是可能的。问题在于如何把这些技术力量组织起来，并且充分发挥他们的潜力。大连起重机器厂在这方面做得很不够。去年，他们在新产品试制任务还不太多的情况下，曾经成立了新产品试制小组来领导新产品试制工作。这种组织只能适应当时任务不大的情况。今年新产品试制任务大量增加以后，这种组织已经显得无能为力了，于是就把它取消。这并没有什么错误。错误在于取消了旧有的组织以后，没有通过各有关部门来加强这方面的工作，致使新产品试制工作的技术领导非常薄弱。二十吨抓斗吊车应在今年四月份交货，但是抓斗焊接方案却在今年六月份才决定。工艺规程对于制造新产品是十分重要的，但是工艺科编的工艺规程，今年八月份以前只完成计划百分之九，九月份只完成计划百分之三。有些产品已经基本上制造好了，但是因为没有试车方案和装配程序表而不能入库。图纸和其他技术资料的错漏和供应不及时等，更是不胜枚举。光是八月份在钳工车间发现设计上的错误就将近四十处。十月份因设计科弄错图纸，就有十多台吊车不能按期入库。加工过程中由于技术指导薄弱，废品和技术事故不断发生。
    在新产品试制这样复杂的技术问题面前，如果技术人员不主动负责，就会到处发生事故。大连起重机器厂对技术力量的组织领导和对技术人员的政治思想领导很薄弱。因此某些技术人员的责任心很差。在设计科，图纸绘好后没有人审核签字，绘图员往上送，科长、工程师则往下推。最近厂里给集二线制造六台龙门吊车。在生产这批吊车之前，用户和苏联专家曾一再指出，这些吊车是用在气候严寒的地区，必须用抗寒的镇静钢制造。但是，工艺科在编制技术供应计划的时候，没有注明需要镇静钢。结果，技术供应科就仍把过去用的沸腾钢材发给金构车间。金构车间技术员接到任务后，也没有仔细看图纸（图纸上注明镇静钢），就用沸腾钢钢材制成了十吨的吊车两台和五吨的吊车四台。直到苏联专家由外地回厂再三追问是不是用镇静钢的时候，才发现用的是沸腾钢，而不是镇静钢。原用沸腾钢做出的六台吊车只好全部积压。这样一来，也就不能按期交货了。
    因此，推行零件标准化，简化生产技术准备工作，把全厂的技术力量很好地组织起来，并且加强对技术人员的政治思想领导，充分发挥技术人员的积极性和主动性，生产准备方面的困难是可以克服的。
    由于新产品任务的大量增加，生产的计划和组织管理工作更加复杂了。这就更需要加强计划管理，使全厂千头万绪的工作都有个统一的计划和安排，使各部门的工作有机地衔接起来，以保证全厂生产顺利进行。但是，大连起重机器厂长期没有一个统一的完整的计划。生产进度计划、材料供应计划、生产技术准备计划互不衔接，使得车间无法按作业计划生产。今年上半年，由于作业计划不准确、生产的零件不成套，加上对零件管理不善，乱丢乱用现象严重，以致五十台桥式吊车虽然基本上装配好了，却因缺少某些小零件而不能入库，而金构车间却盲目生产了三十二吨不必要的零件。大连起重机器厂订计划只是为了凑数字，不结合实际。三月份的计划在执行中补充了九次，使车间无法按计划生产。而且在这个计划里，没有把五月份交货的三台十吨桥式起重机列进去，却把三台七月份才交货的五吨起重机列进去了。这种情况，也是大连起重机器厂长期不能完成国家计划的一个重要原因。
    国家进行有计划的经济建设，要求机械工业生产更多的新产品。国家对于积极制造新产品的单位和个人是给予鼓励和支持的。但是大连起重机器厂在实际工作中，不但没有奖励过对制造新产品有成绩的职工和技术人员，而且在工资制度上也没有给他们以适当的照顾。不少工人在生产老产品的时候，经常得到很多的超额工资。但是，新产品的工时定额打得很紧，不少工人在试制新产品的时候不容易拿到基本工资。这就必然影响职工试制新产品的积极性。这个厂在每月下达车间的生产计划中，不但没有强调新产品的重要性，反而把它们作为
  “杂品”列入计划（九月份，金构车间有十多种新产品被列在杂品里边）。有些不重视新产品试制的车间工作人员，一看见完不成产值计划的时候，就把“杂品”扔下，赶产值大的、好干的活。这就使得很多重要的新产品计划一再拖期。这样怎么能很好地完成新产品试制任务呢？因此，如何从各方面来提倡制造新产品，鼓励大家制造新产品，这也是大连起重机器厂保证完成新产品试制任务的一项很重要的工作。
