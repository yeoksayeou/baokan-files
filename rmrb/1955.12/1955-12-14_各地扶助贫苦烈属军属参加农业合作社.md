Various Localities Assist Impoverished Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel in Joining Agricultural Cooperatives

In the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, local governments are actively assisting impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel in joining agricultural production cooperatives.

This year, the government's expenditure to help impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel increase their means of production totals approximately 42.7 million yuan. Among the families of martyrs and military personnel who received subsidies for means of production, 37% have joined agricultural production cooperatives. In Anhui Province, 50 counties and cities have gratuitously distributed 8,686 head of draught cattle and 30,542 pieces of large farm implements to impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel. After receiving these subsidies, they overcame the difficulties of joining cooperatives and teams. In 1,374 townships in 18 areas including Bengbu and Zongyang, the rate of families of martyrs, military personnel, and demobilized construction soldiers joining cooperatives and teams increased by 24.2% after receiving subsidies for means of production. In the eastern suburban district of Shenyang City, after the government helped impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel overcome the difficulty of lacking cooperative shares, the number of families of martyrs and military personnel joining cooperatives tripled. While assisting families of martyrs and military personnel in joining cooperatives, various localities also pay attention to helping them overcome difficulties in their lives.

After joining cooperatives, families of martyrs and military personnel can engage in labor suitable to their physical strength, and their income has generally increased. Zheng Changqing, a family member of a martyr in Dabeibao Township, Handan County, Hebei Province, is over 60 years old. If he worked in the fields, he could only do 160 workdays per year. After the cooperative assigned him to feed livestock, he did 288 workdays per year. In Wenxi Township, Cuyang County, Shandong Province, none of the 57 families of martyrs and military personnel joined cooperatives in 1953. In 1955, 43 families joined cooperatives and 9 families joined mutual aid teams. In that year, the average yield per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel increased by 68 jin compared to 1953. The number of impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel requiring government subsidies decreased from 24 in 1953 to 3 in 1955.

In the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement this winter and next spring, civil affairs departments in various localities plan to vigorously assist impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel in joining cooperatives by distributing subsidies for means of production. Thirty-three counties in Liaoning Province plan to distribute more than 1,058,000 yuan in subsidies before the end of 1955 to help families of martyrs and military personnel join cooperatives. Wenjiang and Leshan special districts and Jiangjin, Rongchang, Quxian, and Dazhu counties in Sichuan Province have already allocated 178,500 yuan in subsidies in order to promptly help impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel who are about to join and have already joined cooperatives to overcome difficulties in production during the establishment of cooperatives this winter.

    各地扶助贫苦烈属军属参加农业合作社
    在农业合作化运动的大发展中，各地政府积极扶助贫苦的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属参加农业生产合作社。
  今年，政府用来帮助贫苦烈属、军属增加生产资料的经费，共有四千二百七十万元左右。得到生产资料补助费的烈属、军属中，有百分之三十七的人加入了农业生产合作社。安徽省五十个县市已经给贫苦的烈属、军属无偿发放了耕牛八千六百八十六头、大型农具三万零五百四十二件。他们得到这些补助后，克服了入社和入组的困难。蚌埠、枞阳等十八个地区的一千三百七十四个乡的烈属、军属和复员建设军人得到生产资料补助以后，入社和入组的比以前增加了百分之二十四点二。沈阳市东郊区自政府帮助贫苦烈属、军属克服缺少入社股金的困难以后，入社的烈属、军属就增加了三倍。各地在扶助烈属、军属入社的时候，还注意帮助他们克服生活上的困难。
    烈属、军属入社以后，就可以从事适合自己体力的劳动，因而收入普遍得到增加。河北省邯郸县大北堡乡烈属郑长清已经有六十多岁，如果下地劳动，全年只能做一百六十个劳动日，社内分配他喂牲口以后，全年做了二百八十八个劳动日。山东省徂阳县汶西乡五十七户烈属、军属，在一九五三年没有一户入社，一九五五年有四十三户入社，九户参加互助组，这一年，烈属、军属每亩土地的平均产量比一九五三年增加六十八斤；一九五三年需要政府补助的贫苦烈属、军属有二十四户，一九五五年就减少到三户。
    在今冬明春的农业合作化运动的高潮中，各地民政部门都计划用发放生产资料补助费的办法，大力扶助贫苦烈属、军属入社。辽宁省的三十三个县计划在一九五五年年底以前，发放补助费一百零五万八千多元，帮助烈属、军属入社。四川省温江、乐山等专区和江津、荣昌、渠县、大竹等县已调整出补助费十七万八千五百元，以便在今冬建社中，及时帮助将要入社和已经入社的贫苦烈属、军属克服生产上的困难。　（新华社）
