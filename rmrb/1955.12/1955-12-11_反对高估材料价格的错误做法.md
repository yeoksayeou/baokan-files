To the Editors:

The Second Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in contracting for the capital construction project of a certain factory in Dalian, overestimated the price of materials by 200,000 yuan. For example, the rubble used for the Haitou dike was transported by sailboats, but they assumed the quarry was located far away and calculated the freight based on truck transportation. As a result, they increased the price of each cubic meter of rubble from an actual cost of just over five yuan to over ten yuan. The company "earned" 100,000 yuan from this one material alone. The company included these "earned" funds in their "cost reduction plan."

When relevant departments reviewed the construction budget, they discovered this problem and asked the company to revise the material valuation; however, they refused.

In July, the "Luda People's Daily" published an article criticizing certain construction departments in the Luda area for overestimating budgets, which also mentioned this company's erroneous behavior. As a result, the company went around looking for relevant departments, trying to find "reasons" to refute the party newspaper's criticism. The Luda City Planning Commission, the competent authority responsible for formulating regional material prices, specially convened a meeting of the parties involved (both the contracting and client companies), the Urban Construction Bureau, and the Construction Bank to point out that the rubble used for transporting the Haitou dike should not be transported by truck, but only by sailboat. Therefore, the price of the rubble should be calculated according to the average price in the Luda area; if the starting point of transportation has been determined, it should be calculated according to the actual transportation distance and the freight rates stipulated by the state-owned transportation departments. However, the company still disagreed, using the excuse of needing to consult the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry (in fact, the Ministry of Heavy Industry issued instructions in March of this year that material prices should be calculated based on the regional prices formulated by the local planning commission or prices approved by the planning commission). They also wrote a letter to the "Luda People's Daily," resorting to sophistry to resist criticism.

During this period, the Luda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the company's Party organization to supervise the administrative side to respect the opinions of the local government, but this instruction was not taken seriously. In October, the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry again instructed the company that the material price issue should be handled in accordance with the opinions of the Municipal Planning Commission; however, the company only reduced the price of the rubble to 7.3 yuan, claiming that it had already "made great efforts" and "made many concessions," and refused to thoroughly correct its mistakes.

The Second Engineering Company's insistence on overestimating material prices has caused the budget review and unit price modification work to be reworked many times, resulting in the serious consequence of over-appropriating national construction funds. The Ministry of Heavy Industry and relevant discipline inspection departments can no longer sit idly by and ignore this issue!

### 反对高估材料价格的错误做法

    反对高估材料价格的错误做法编辑同志：
    重工业部建筑局第二工程公司在承包大连某厂的基本建设工程中，把材料价格高估了二十万元。例如，海头围坝用的毛石是用帆船运输的，但是他们却把采石地点假定在距离很远的地方，并且按照汽车运输来计算运价，因此就把每立方公尺毛石的价格从实际成本五元多提高到十元多，公司从毛石这一项材料中就赚了十万元。像这样“赚”来的钱，公司都列入了“降低成本计划”中。
    有关部门在审查建设预算的时候，发现了这个问题，就要这个公司修改材料估价；但是他们拒绝了。
    七月间，旅大人民日报发表了一篇批评旅大地区某些建筑部门高估预算的稿件，其中也提到这个公司的错误行为。于是，这个公司就到处找有关部门，想找“理由”来反驳党报的批评。负责制定地区材料价格的主管机关——旅大市计划委员会特地为这件事召集了甲乙双方、城市建设局和建设银行等单位开会，指出运输海头围坝用的毛石，不应该用汽车运，只能用帆船运，因此毛石价格应按照旅大地区的平均价格计算；如果已经确定了起运地点，应该按照实际运输距离和国营运输部门规定的运价来计算。但是这个公司还是不同意这样做，竟借口要请示重工业部建筑局（实际上今年三月重工业部就发了指示：材料价格应该根据当地计委制定的地区价格或计委同意了的价格计算），并且写信给旅大人民日报，强词夺理地来抗拒批评。
    在这期间，中共旅大市委会指示这个公司的党组织要监督行政方面尊重当地政府的意见，但是这个指示并没有受到重视。十月份，重工业部建筑局又指示公司，材料价格问题应该按照市计划委员会的意见执行；但是公司只把毛石的价格降低到七元三角，并且说是已经“尽了很大的努力”和“作了多次的让步”，而不肯彻底纠正自己的错误。
    第二工程公司坚持高估的材料价格，已经使得审查预算和修改单价的工作多次返工，造成了超拨国家建设资金的严重后果。重工业部和有关的纪律检查部门不能再坐视这个问题不管了！
