An Example of US "Aid" to Backward Countries
——The Deteriorating Turkish Economy
　　Zhou Xiuqing
　　All members of the Turkish government, except the Prime Minister, collectively resigned on November 29. According to the Associated Press, this resignation was caused by "the deteriorating economic situation in Turkey."
　　It is well known that Turkey's economic situation is getting worse and worse. Since 1947, Turkey has been receiving US "aid," so why is its economic situation getting worse instead? From this, we can see what US so-called "aid" to backward countries really is.
　　The deterioration of Turkey's economic situation is first manifested in its foreign trade. Before the war, Turkey's foreign trade had a trade deficit, but it was limited. For example, in 1938 it was only 4.9 million Turkish pounds. However, after receiving "US aid," its import surplus reached 800 million Turkish pounds in 1954 alone, an increase of more than 160 times compared to 1938. This year, Turkey's import and export situation is even worse. According to the Associated Press, "Turkey's foreign trade deficit in the first six months of this year has reached 112.5 million US dollars (one US dollar equals 2.8 Turkish pounds), an increase of 19 million US dollars compared to the same period in 1954." Turkey's foreign trade deficit is made up by foreign debt and gold. Therefore, at the end of 1952, Turkey's outstanding foreign debt far exceeded the 407.8 million Turkish pounds in the Central Bank of Turkey's inventory at that time. In order to repay its foreign debt, Turkey had to sell most of its gold reserves to foreign countries.
　　As US commodities enter the Turkish market unimpeded, Turkey's originally weak national industry has suffered a serious blow. The production of Turkey's textile, leather, tobacco and other industrial sectors is shrinking, and factories are closing down in large numbers. Former Turkish Minister of Labor Barlas also admitted in 1953 that the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" in Turkey resulted in the closure of 412 factories and a general reduction in civil industry production by 50 to 80 percent. Turkey's agriculture was already very backward, with 50 percent of the country's arable land not cultivated. Under the impact of the US dumping of "surplus" agricultural products policy, its agricultural production has declined even further. Turkish newspapers wrote in alarm: US economic control is driving Turkey's agriculture to a dead end.
　　Due to the sluggish foreign trade and the decline in industrial and agricultural production, Turkey's currency has devalued and prices have risen. Since 1947, the amount of currency in circulation in Turkey has continued to grow. In October 1954, it had increased from 191 million Turkish pounds in 1938 to 2.608 billion Turkish pounds. Inflation has brought about rising prices. According to Turkish newspapers, the purchasing power of the Turkish pound has been reduced by half in recent years.
　　Under this economic situation, the deterioration of the living conditions of the Turkish people has become an inevitable result. At present, the number of unemployed workers is about 2 to 4 million. Those who have jobs do not earn enough to maintain a minimum standard of living. The special committee of the Turkish National Assembly investigating the living conditions of workers also admitted that the living conditions of workers were worse than those of people in the Middle Ages. The lives of farmers are even more painful.
　　The fact is very obvious that one of the main reasons for the deterioration of Turkey's economic situation is that Turkey follows the United States in implementing the policy of arms expansion and war preparations. As everyone knows, the main purpose of the United States' enthusiasm for giving Turkey "aid" is to force Turkey to serve its war policy. According to the British "Financial Times", between 1947 and 1952, the so-called "aid" from the United States to Turkey totaled 1.04 billion US dollars, most of which was used for military purposes, that is, to purchase arms, build naval ports, airports, and strategic railways and highways. Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc in 1952, signed the Turkey-Pakistan agreement with Pakistan in 1954, and concluded the so-called Baghdad Pact with Iraq at the beginning of this year. Under the instigation of the United States, it accelerated its arms expansion and war preparations. At present, military spending in the national budget accounts for almost two-thirds. Turkey's huge military expenditure has brought a serious crisis to the country's finances and national economy. Although it has cut other expenditures, increased taxes, and abused currency issuance, its financial situation is still deteriorating. According to official materials, Turkey's national debt has reached 2.896 billion Turkish pounds. Before the war in 1938, Turkey's fiscal revenue and expenditure were balanced with a surplus of 1 million Turkish pounds, while the deficit in 1953-54 reached 163 million Turkish pounds. Former Turkish Prime Minister Menderes admitted: "We use more than 50 percent of the budget for military expenditures, which is one of the reasons for our country's backwardness."
　　Another main reason for the deterioration of Turkey's economic situation is the US plunder of the Turkish economy. Like other countries, the US plunder of Turkey is carried out under the guise of "aid." The US not only uses "aid" to dump goods, but also uses "aid" to force Turkey to grant "free" trade privileges, making US commodities flood the Turkish market. The Turkish government's promulgation of a series of decrees such as "encouraging foreign investment" allows US capital to enter various economic sectors in Turkey and control the economic lifeline of Turkey. US monopoly capital, such as the Morgan, Rockefeller and Mellon consortia, has long controlled Turkey's most important industrial sectors such as mining (mainly valuable strategic raw materials such as chromium, copper, coal, manganese and oil), metallurgy, cement, chemical and electrical appliances. Among them, the United States transports 400,000 tons of chromium ore annually, which accounts for about one-quarter of the world's total chromium exports. The United States has wantonly destroyed and undermined Turkey's national industry, making Turkey's national industry increasingly衰微.
　　As for Turkish agriculture, it is completely controlled by a resident delegation consisting of 15 US "experts" living in Ankara. This US delegation ignores the hunger of the Turkish people and forces Turkey to transport Turkish grain to the North Atlantic Group forces and strategic raw materials and wheat to West Germany in accordance with the US Mutual Security Agency agreement imposed on it.
　　This insatiable plunder of the Turkish economy by the United States has kept Turkey in a state of poverty and backwardness, which cannot but arouse the dissatisfaction of the Turkish public and public opinion. The Turkish "Independent" newspaper pointed out that US "aid" is turning Turkey into "Uncle Sam's prisoner." The newspaper wrote, "The country is a prisoner of foreign capital, politicians are its servants, and the people are merely a source of profit." Former Turkish Foreign Minister Sukru Kaya also believes: "If we do not protect our local industry and our merchants, banks, artisans and industry, then we will be submerged by foreign capital. This will undoubtedly be a historical recurrence. The Turks will once again be economically enslaved by foreigners."
　　It can be seen from this that if Turkey wants to get rid of its current economic difficulties, it must first change its practice of following the United States and pursue a policy of peace and independence. At present, the broad public in Turkey has increasingly clearly expressed this desire. The appeal issued recently by a group of prominent figures in Turkey calls on the Turkish government to "maintain neutrality" because "only neutrality can guarantee peace, tranquility and security" and develop the country's peaceful economy and improve the people's lives. This view is completely correct.

    美国“援助”落后国家一例
    ——日益恶化中的土耳其经济
  　周修庆
    土耳其政府的全体成员除总理外在十一月二十九日集体辞职。据美联社报道，这次辞职是由于“土耳其正在恶化的经济情况”所引起的。
    土耳其经济情况越来越恶化，这已经是众所周知的事了。从一九四七年以来，土耳其就接受美国的“援助”，为什么它的经济情况反会不好起来呢？从这里也就可以看到美国所谓对落后国家的
  “援助”究竟是怎么一回事了。
    土耳其经济情况的恶化，首先表现在它的对外贸易上。在战前，土耳其的对外贸易就存在逆差，但为数有限。如一九三八年仅为四百九十万土镑。然而，在接受“美援”后，仅在一九五四年它的入超便达八亿土镑，比一九三八年增加了一百六十多倍。今年，土耳其的出入口情况更糟。据美联社报道：“土耳其在今年头六个月中的对外贸易赤字，已经达到一亿一千二百五十万美元（一美元合二点八土镑），比一九五四年同期增加了一千九百万美元。”土耳其对外贸易赤字是靠外债和黄金来弥补的。因此，在一九五二年末，土耳其应当清偿的外债即已远远超过土耳其中央银行当时库存的四亿零七百八十万土镑。为了清偿外债，土耳其不得不把大部分黄金储备卖给了外国。
    由于美国商品畅行无阻的进入土耳其市场，使土耳其原来就很微弱的民族工业遭到严重的打击。土耳其的纺织、皮革、烟草和其他工业部门的生产日益缩减，工厂大批关闭。土耳其前劳动部长巴尔拉斯一九五三年也曾承认，土耳其实行“马歇尔计划”的结果，使四百十二家工厂关了门，使民用工业普遍减产百分之五十至八十。土耳其的农业本来就很落后，全国可耕地有百分之五十没有耕种。在美国倾销“剩余”农产品政策的打击下，它的农业生产就更加下降。土耳其报刊曾惊惶地写道：美国的经济控制，正使土耳其的农业走上绝路。
    由于对外贸易的不振和工农业生产下降，引起了土耳其的货币贬值和物价上涨。从一九四七年起，土耳其的货币流通额不断增长。在一九五四年十月，已由一九三八年的一亿九千一百万土镑增长到二十六亿零八百万土镑。通货膨胀带来了物价的上涨。据土耳其报纸报道，土镑的购买力在最近几年中降低了一半。
    在这种经济情况下，土耳其人民生活状况的恶化，便成为不可避免的结果。现在，工人失业人数约达二—四百万。有工作的人，收入也不足以维持最低限度的生活。土耳其国民议会调查工人生活状况的专门委员会也承认，工人的生活状况比中世纪时人民生活还不如。农民的生活更加痛苦。
    事实是很明显的，土耳其经济情况恶化的主要原因之一，就是由于土耳其追随美国执行扩军备战政策。大家知道，美国所以如此热心给予土耳其“援助”，其主要目的正是要迫使土耳其为它的战争政策服务。据英国“金融时报”报道，在一九四七年至一九五二年之间，美国对土耳其的所谓“援助”共计十亿零四千万美元，其中绝大部分是用于军事方面的，也就是说，是用来购买军火、建筑军港、机场、战略的铁路与公路等。土耳其自一九五二年加入了北大西洋公约侵略集团，一九五四年和巴基斯坦订立土巴协定，并在今年初同伊拉克缔结所谓巴格达条约后，在美国指使下加速扩军备战。现在国家预算中的军事费用几乎占三分之二。土耳其的庞大的军事开支，给国家财政和国民经济带来了严重的危机，虽然削减其他支出，增加税收，滥发通货，其财政状况也仍是日趋恶化。据官方材料，土耳其的国债已达到二十八亿九千六百万土镑。在战前一九三八年，土耳其财政上收支相抵尚剩一百万土镑，而一九五三—五四年度赤字竟达一亿六千三百万土镑。土耳其前总理曼德列斯承认：“我们把百分之五十以上的预算用作军事开支，这就是造成我国落后的原因之一。”
    土耳其经济情况恶化的另一个主要原因，是美国对土耳其经济的掠夺。和对其他国家一样，美国对土耳其的掠夺，也是在“援助”的幌子下进行的，美国不仅通过“援助”来倾销商品，而且利用“援助”迫使土耳其给予“自由”贸易的特权，使美国商品在土耳其市场上到处泛滥。土耳其政府颁布的“奖励外国投资”等一系列的法令，使美国资本得以进入土耳其的各个经济部门，掌握了土耳其的经济命脉。美国的垄断资本，如摩根、洛克菲勒和梅隆等财团，长期以来就控制着土耳其的采矿（主要是铬、铜、煤、锰和石油等贵重战略原料）、冶金、水泥、化学和电器等土耳其最重要的工业部门。其中单以铬矿砂一项来说，美国每年便运走四十万吨，这占全世界铬的总输出额四分之一左右。美国对土耳其的民族工业横加摧残和破坏，使土耳其的民族工业日趋衰微。
    至于土耳其的农业，则完全掌握在一个由十五个住在安卡拉的美国“专家”组成的常驻代表团手里。这个美国代表团不顾土耳其人民的饥饿，迫使土耳其根据强加于它身上的美国共同安全署协定，把土耳其的粮食运交北大西洋集团部队，并把战略原料和小麦运交西德。
    美国对土耳其经济的这种贪得无厌的掠夺，使土耳其继续处于贫穷落后状态，不能不引起土耳其公众和舆论的不满。土耳其“独立报”指出，美国的“援助”正把土耳其变为“山姆叔叔的俘虏”。该报写道，“国家是外国资本的俘虏，政治家是它的仆人，而人民仅是利润的来源。”土耳其前外交部长苏克鲁·卡亚也认为：“假如我们不保护我们的本地工业和我们的商人、银行、手工业者以及工业，那末我们将被外国资本所淹没。这将无疑地发生历史重演。土耳其人要再度在经济上受外国人的奴役。”
    由此可见，土耳其若要摆脱目前经济困难的状况，首先要改变它的追随美国的作法，奉行和平和独立的政策。目前，土耳其的广大公众，已日益明显地表示了这种愿望。最近土耳其的一批著名人士所发表的呼吁书，要求土耳其政府“保持中立”，因为“只有中立才能保障和平、宁静和安全”，并发展国家的和平经济，提高人民生活。这种意见是完全正确的。
