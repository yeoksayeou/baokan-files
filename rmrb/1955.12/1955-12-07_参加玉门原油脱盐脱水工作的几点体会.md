Petroleum is one of the driving forces of industry and a necessity for people's lives. With the development of the country's economic construction, its need is increasing day by day. However, the foundation of China's petroleum industry is extremely weak, and some existing factories and mines often fail to fully utilize their inherent production and technical capabilities due to certain technical problems. For example, the issue of crude oil desalting and dehydration is one of them.

Crude oil extracted from oil wells in Yumen often contains a large amount of salt water. This easily leads to problems such as furnace tube blockage, oil surging, heat consumption, and increased pressure during refining, resulting in a significant reduction in refinery production capacity and failure to complete production plans. For example, a certain refinery's production volume in the first quarter of this year was only a quarter of the original plan because the crude oil desalting and dehydration problem could not be solved. The salt content in the mine water, especially magnesium chloride and calcium chloride, will cause hydrolytic decomposition during refining, generating hydrochloric acid and corroding production equipment. The salt that remains in the residual oil will also affect the quality of heavy oil and asphalt. In addition, the presence of salt and water in crude oil will also cause many losses in storage and transportation.

The factory and mine, as well as the former Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, raised the issue of crude oil desalting and dehydration a long time ago. However, because the crude oil desalting and dehydration problem is relatively complex and the research work was not vigorously pursued, it took more than two years of exploration without a solution. In the past year, the desalting problem has become increasingly acute, attracting the attention of all parties, and finally, with the joint efforts and close cooperation of the factory and mine and the research institute, a preliminary solution has recently been found.

Research on the crude oil desalting problem began at the end of 1952. At that time, research was conducted simultaneously on "chemical desalting" and "high-voltage electrical desalting." Because there was no evaluation standard in the laboratory for "chemical desalting," various desalting agents were tested without results. Due to insufficient technical strength, the "high-voltage electrical desalting" test was stopped midway after half a year. (This year, Yumen Oil Mine successfully conducted a small-scale electrical desalting test based on the Romanian design.) In 1953, a desalting agent НЧК was imitated using Fushun diesel as raw material, but it did not yield results. At that time, it was suspected that the crude oil had been stored for a long time and may have aged, affecting desalting. Therefore, in the autumn of 1953, we went to Yumen Oil Mine for testing, but it was still ineffective. Finally, it was found that applying НЧК and raising the temperature in a pressure autoclave had good desalting efficiency, which can be said to be the beginning of Yumen crude oil being able to be desalted. However, at that time, the reaction conditions of autoclave desalting were not carefully analyzed, and the difficulties of practical application to industrial production were not considered. As a result, testing continued for more than half a year, and in mid-1954, we went to Yumen Oil Mine again and conducted small-scale continuous testing with the comrades of Yumen Oil Mine. Although success was also achieved, it was still abandoned because of excessive heat consumption and no practical application value. At this time, the comrades of Yumen Oil Mine further improved the device in further tests, making the small-scale high-temperature liquid-phase desalting test successful. This had practical application value in industry. However, "high-temperature liquid-phase desalting" has a high temperature and easily causes salt scaling and blockage of furnace tubes, so the equipment needs to be pressure-resistant, and most of the desalting equipment currently on site cannot withstand high pressure. Therefore, when the desalting problem at the Shanghai Refinery was serious at the beginning of this year, we went to Shanghai again and worked with the comrades in the factory to develop the "low-temperature liquid-phase desalting method" using НЧК as a desalting agent. However, НЧК was used in large quantities, costly, and difficult to supply, which made the contradiction of desalting agents even more acute. Soon, with the cooperation of technical personnel from the former Petroleum Administration Bureau, the Shanghai Refinery successfully conducted desalting and dehydration tests using oil foot soap. After medium-scale verification, large-scale equipment was installed and officially put into production.

The success of desalting research is certainly due to the accumulation of past work experience, but more importantly, it is due to the close combination of factories and mines and research departments in recent years. As a result of researchers frequently going down to the factories, they understood the actual situation on site, clarified the main key to the problem, corrected the tendency of research work to deviate from reality, and made the work more realistic. At the same time, under the influence of the research departments, the research strength of factories and mines also improved their rational understanding and research level, so that practice was guided by theory. In this way, the research goals were clarified, the research strength was strengthened, and on the basis of mutual cooperation and mutual improvement, the research on the problem was continuously deepened and tended to be resolved.

The desalting problem is a technical research topic. Its main purpose is to solve specific problems in production. Therefore, a full estimate must be made of the technical conditions of the factory and mine and the possibility of practical application to industrial production, so as not to deviate from reality. However, comrades engaged in scientific research, because they have been working in the laboratory, are often interested in the results of their experiments and ignore the objective actual situation, believing that as long as the research is successful, the factory can scale it up accordingly, and less consider what difficulties will arise in scaling up. For example, high-pressure autoclave desalting has good efficiency, but it does not take into account that heating with an oil bath in the laboratory requires the equivalent of a large boiler for heat on an industrial scale, which is extremely uneconomical from the perspective of thermal efficiency. As a result, although the test was successful, it could not be practically applied in industry.

Experience tells us that engaging in research on industrial production technology problems must also have an economic accounting perspective and must clearly understand the source and supply of relevant raw materials. For example, the successful low-temperature liquid-phase desalting of НЧК is suitable for site conditions. However, when contacting НЧК's production and supply, it was found that НЧК's production would affect the planned production volume of diesel, which could not be supplied in large quantities, and because domestic mineral oil is relatively scarce and the cost is high, even if it is produced, the site cannot adopt it.

In addition to this, engaging in research on industrial production technology problems must also understand all relevant parts of the entire work. For example, it is certainly good to solve the desalting problem in coastal refineries, but Yumen crude oil is transported from the remote northwest. In the case of heavy national transportation tasks, if the crude oil contains a large amount of water, it will reduce transportation efficiency and increase transportation costs. In the current situation, it will bring the country hundreds of thousands of yuan in losses every year. Therefore, it must be suggested that the desalting and dehydration of Yumen crude oil should be carried out at the Yumen Oil Production Department in the future. Also, even if the crude oil shipped from Yumen does not contain salt or water, the crude oil freezes in winter. During the eastbound transport, steam is directly heated for loading and unloading, which not only causes the loss of light oil fractions, but also artificially generates emulsification, and the refineries will still encounter dehydration troubles. Therefore, it must be suggested to add indirect heating equipment to tank cars to avoid unnecessary losses.

This also shows that the research on industrial production technology problems must be combined with the actual conditions on site and must fully consider all issues. All kinds of actual conditions on site must never be ignored or neglected. Otherwise, the work will fail and the solution to the problem will be delayed. This is our first experience.

Secondly, another tendency to deviate from reality for those engaged in scientific research is that they only like to study theoretical problems and do not like to study practical problems. They think that practical problems are too "superficial" and not as "profound" as theoretical research, mechanically separating and opposing theory and practice. Through the desalting research work, we deeply realized that through the study of practical problems, we can provide rich materials for theoretical research and deepen our understanding of theory. And theory can only play its important guiding role when it is combined with practice.

With the progress of the work, many new problems constantly arose. For example, after the "high-pressure autoclave desalting" was successfully operated continuously, the problem of excessive heat consumption occurred, and further tests were improved to the "high-temperature liquid-phase desalting method"; high-temperature liquid-phase desalting still had a high temperature and required pressure-resistant equipment, which did not conform to the site conditions, and was improved to the "low-temperature liquid-phase desalting method"; and when low-temperature liquid-phase desalting was carried out, the main problem became the desalting agent problem, and finally, through a large amount of practice by most people, a new desalting agent was found, which solved this problem.

Therefore, the research on industrial production technology problems must carefully analyze contradictions and grasp the key problems for research. At the same time, it must be noted that things are developing, and all conservative ideas should be overcome, and we should move forward quickly following the evolution of things. When the theory is not complete enough, we should improve our understanding through practice, and constantly summarize and analyze the results of practice, and raise some perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. Then use rational knowledge to guide our practice. This is what Chairman Mao taught us in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." This is our second experience.

Again, at present, all factories and mines have a part of research power. In order to solve the key problems in production as soon as possible, they are also conducting research at the same time. Although factories are busy with production and cannot invest a lot of power in research work at present; however, it has been proven that when their rich production experience is combined with our work, the work will progress exceptionally quickly. For example, when we succeeded in the small-scale continuous test of "high-pressure autoclave desalting", Yumen Oil Mine quickly improved it into the "high-temperature liquid-phase desalting method". And when we pointed out the contradiction of desalting agents in the "low-temperature liquid-phase desalting" test at the Shanghai Refinery, they quickly found a new and inexpensive desalting agent, which solved this problem.

Therefore, through practical work, we deeply feel the importance of the combination of scientific researchers and production technical personnel. A complex and detailed industrial technical problem must closely combine research work with production experience in order to accelerate the solution of the problem. This is our third experience.

Finally, in contact and cooperation with factories and mines, we must overcome individualistic thinking. Intellectuals have always engaged in individual labor in the past and can easily overestimate their role in the collective and not see the achievements of others. In fact, any work is developed on the basis of other people's work. For example, after we researched the "high-pressure autoclave desalting method", the comrades of Yumen Oil Mine quickly proposed the "high-temperature liquid-phase desalting method". We developed their experience and improved it to the "low-temperature liquid-phase desalting method". Then, the Shanghai Refinery discovered a new desalting agent, which made the desalting work more solid. If we did not closely follow the achievements of others and improve them, but indulged in our own existing achievements, the research work would stagnate. Therefore, we must always maintain a humble attitude, always learn from others, and always share our achievements and experiences with others without reservation. Only in this way can we exert collective strength and make the work progress faster.

We deeply realize that such contact and cooperation is impossible in countries with capitalist systems, which fully demonstrates the superiority of our people's democratic system. This is the result of the Party's education of intellectuals. Without ideological transformation and recognizing the harm of individualism, it is difficult to imagine such close cooperation. This is our fourth experience.

    参加玉门原油脱盐脱水工作的几点体会
    中国科学院石油研究所研究员　朱葆琳  研究实习员　叶祖衡
    石油是工业动力之一，是人民生活的必需品。随着国家经济建设事业的发展，它的需要日益增加。但是我国石油工业的基础异常薄弱，而现有的一些厂矿，也经常因某些枝节的技术问题，使应有的生产技术能力不能充分发挥。例如，原油脱盐脱水问题就是其中之一。
    玉门原油自油井中开采出来，经常含有大量盐水。这样，在炼制的时候，就容易发生炉管堵塞、冲油、消耗热量以及压力增大等弊端，以致使炼厂生产能力大大降低，生产计划不能完成。例如，某炼油厂因为原油脱盐脱水问题不能解决，今年第一季的生产量仅达原计划四分之一。矿水中所含的盐分，特别是氯化镁和氯化钙，在炼制的时候，会起加水分解作用，产生盐酸，腐蚀生产设备。盐分最后遗留在残油中，也会影响重油和沥青的品质。此外，原油含盐含水在贮存和运输上也会造成很多损失。
    厂矿及前燃料工业部石油管理总局，很早就提出原油脱盐脱水问题。但是由于原油脱盐脱水问题比较复杂，研究工作也没有抓紧进行，以致摸索了二年多，没有获得解决。最近一年来，脱盐问题日益尖锐，引起了各方面的重视，终于在厂矿同研究所共同努力和密切合作下，在最近觅得了初步解决的办法。
    原油脱盐问题的研究，开始于一九五二年年底。当时同时进行了“化学剂脱盐”及“高压电脱盐”两种方法的研究。“化学剂脱盐”因实验室内尚无一套评价标准，曾试了多种脱盐剂，没有获得结果。“高压电脱盐”因技术力量不足，试验了半年，不得不于中途停止。（今年，玉门油矿仿照罗马尼亚设计进行小型电气脱盐试验，获得成功。）一九五三年以抚顺柴油为原料仿制了脱盐剂НЧК，也没有获得结果。当时怀疑原油贮存日久，可能老化，影响脱盐。于是在一九五三年秋去玉门油矿进行试验，但依旧无效。最后发现应用НЧК在加压釜内升高温度，有良好的脱盐效率，这可说是玉门原油能够脱盐的开始。然而当时对高压釜脱盐反应情况未作仔细分析，没有考虑到实际应用到工业生产上去的困难，结果又继续试验了半年多，并于一九五四年年中再去玉门油矿，同玉门油矿工作同志一起进行了小型连续试验，虽然也获得了成功，仍因热量消耗过大，无实际应用的价值，不得不放弃这条道路。这时玉门油矿工作同志在进一步试验中，改进了装置，使在高温液相下小型脱盐试验成功。这样就具有了在工业上实际应用的价值。但“高温液相脱盐”，温度较高，容易使炉管结盐堵塞，所以设备需要耐压，而目前现场的脱盐设备大多不能耐很高压力。故当今年年初，上海炼油厂脱盐问题严重的时候，我们又去上海，和厂内同志一起发展了以НЧК为脱盐剂的“低温液相脱盐法”。可是НЧК用量多，成本高，供应有困难，使脱盐剂的矛盾又趋于尖锐。不久上海炼油厂在前石油管理总局技术人员配合下，采用油脚皂进行脱盐脱水试验获得成功，经中型试验证实后，即进行安装大型设备，正式投入生产。
    脱盐研究的成功，固然是由于过去工作经验的累积，但更重要的是由于近年来厂矿和研究部门密切结合的缘故。研究人员经常下厂的结果，明了了现场实际情况，弄清了问题的主要关键，纠正了研究工作脱离实际的倾向，使工作更具有现实性。同时厂矿的研究力量，在研究部门的影响下，也提高了理性认识和研究水平，使实践得到了理论的指导。这样，研究目标明确了，研究力量壮大了，在相互配合，相互提高的基础上，使对问题的研究不断深入而趋于解决。
    脱盐问题是一个技术性的研究题目。其目的主要在解决生产上的具体问题。因此必须对厂矿的技术条件及实际应用到工业生产上去的可能性作充分的估计，才不致于脱离实际。但从事科学研究工作的同志，由于一直在实验室内工作，往往对自己试验的结果感到兴趣，而忽视了客观实际情况，认为只要研究成功，工厂可照样放大，而较少考虑到放大会产生什么困难。例如，高压釜脱盐有很好的效率，但没有考虑到在实验室用油浴加热，工业上放大后所需的热量，即相当于一个大锅炉，从热的效能上看，是极不经济的。结果虽然试验成功，也不能在工业上实际应用。
    经验告诉我们，从事工业生产技术问题的研究，还必须有经济核算观点，必须清楚了解有关原料来源及供应情况。例如，НЧК低温液相脱盐成功，这是适合现场条件的。但是当联系НЧК的生产及供应时，发现НЧК的生产将影响柴油的计划生产量，是无法大量供应的，而且由于国内矿物油较缺乏，成本较高，即使生产，现场也无法采用。
    除此以外，从事工业生产技术问题的研究，还必须了解整个工作的一切有关部分。例如，脱盐问题在沿海各炼油厂解决了固然很好，但是玉门原油是由西北遥远运来，在国家运输任务繁重的情况下，如果原油中含有大量的水，势将减低运输效能，增加运输成本，就目前的情况来说，每年即将带给国家达百万元的损失。因此必须建议，今后玉门原油的脱盐脱水要在玉门采油处进行。又如，即使玉门运出的原油都不含盐含水，但在冬季，原油冻结，在东运途中，装车卸车要用蒸汽直接加热，不但造成轻油分的损失，又人为地产生乳化，各炼油厂依旧将碰到脱水的麻烦。因此必须建议增添油槽车间接加热设备，来避免不必要的损失。
    这也就说明，工业生产技术问题的研究必须结合现场实际条件，必须全面考虑一切问题。对现场的各种实际条件，绝对不能忽视偏废的。否则就会使工作落空，就会拖延问题的解决。这是我们第一点体会。
    其次，从事科学研究工作的，另一脱离实际的倾向是光喜欢研究理论问题，而不喜欢研究实际问题。以为实际问题太“粗浅”，不像理论研究那样“高深”，把理论和实际机械地割裂开来，对立起来。我们通过脱盐研究工作，深深体会到通过实际问题的研究，可以为理论研究提供丰富的材料，可以加深我们对理论的理解。而理论也只有和实际结合，才能发挥它的重要的指导作用。
    随着工作的进展，不断地发生了许多新的问题。例如，“高压釜脱盐”连续运转成功后，发生了热量消耗过大的问题，进一步试验，就改进为“高温液相脱盐法”；高温液相脱盐依旧因温度较高，设备需要耐压，同现场条件不符，又改进为“低温液相脱盐法”；而当进行低温液相脱盐时，主要问题又成为脱盐剂问题，最后经过多数人的大量实践，又找到了一种新的脱盐剂，解决了这一问题。
    因此，工业生产技术问题的研究必须仔细分析矛盾，抓住其中关键性问题进行研究。同时必须注意到事物是在发展着的，应该克服一切保守思想，跟随着事物的演变，迅速前进。在理论还不够完备的时候，应该通过实践来提高认识，随时总结和分析实践的结果，把一些感性的认识，上升为理性认识。再通过理性的认识来指导我们的实践。这就是毛主席在“实践论”和“矛盾论”里所教导我们的，这是我们第二点体会。
    再次，目前各厂矿，都有一部分研究力量，为了早日解决生产上的关键问题，他们也在同时进行研究。虽然由于工厂忙于生产，目前对研究工作还不能投入很多力量；但是已经证明，他们丰富的生产经验和我们的工作结合起来，就会使工作进展得异常迅速。例如，我们使“高压釜脱盐”小型连续试验成功，因消耗热量过多无法进行实际的工业生产时，玉门油矿很快就改进成为“高温液相脱盐法”。而当我们到上海炼油厂，“低温液相脱盐”试验结果，指出了脱盐剂的矛盾后，他们就很快找到了新的价廉的脱盐剂。
    因此，通过实际工作，使我们深深感到科学研究工作者和生产技术工作人员结合的重要性。一个复杂细致的工业技术问题，必须使研究工作同生产经验密切地结合起来，才能加速问题的解决。这是我们第三点体会。
    最后，在同厂矿联系合作中，必须克服个人主义思想。知识分子过去一直从事个体劳动，很容易过高地估计自己在集体中的作用，而看不到别人的成绩。事实上，任何工作都是在别人工作的基础上发展起来的。例如，当我们研究出“高压釜脱盐法”后，玉门油矿工作同志就很快提出了“高温液相脱盐法”。我们发展了他们的经验，又改进为“低温液相脱盐法”。接着上海炼油厂发现了新的脱盐剂，使脱盐工作更加巩固。如果不是这样紧跟着别人的成果，加以改进，而留恋于自己已有的成绩，就会使研究工作停滞不前。因此必须随时抱着谦虚的态度，随时向别人学习，也必须随时将自己的成果和体会，毫无保留地同别人交流。只有这样，才能发挥集体力量，使工作更快地提高。
    我们深深体会到，这样的联系合作，在资本主义制度的国家里是不可能的，这也充分说明了我们人民民主制度的优越性。这是党对知识分子进行教育所获得的结果。不通过思想改造，认识了个人主义的危害，也就很难想像能够有这样紧密的合作。这是我们的第四点体会。
