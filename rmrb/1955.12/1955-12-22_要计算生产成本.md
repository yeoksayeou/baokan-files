The sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in the first district of Yangchun County, Guangdong Province, generally found that the costs of agriculture and sideline occupations were too high when they did their year-end accounts this year. For example, the first agricultural cooperative in Shengping Township had a total income of 12,397 yuan for the whole year, with agricultural and sideline costs totaling 5,181 yuan, accounting for 41.7% of the total income; the agricultural and sideline costs of the second cooperative accounted for 40% of the total income. The agricultural and sideline costs of the first cooperative in Kongtong Township accounted for 50% of the total income. Due to high costs, although the cooperatives increased production, the income of the members was low. For example, the second cooperative in Shengping increased production by 20%, but most of the 27 member households in the whole cooperative had lower incomes than before joining the cooperative, and the production enthusiasm of Qiu Yiguang, the director of the cooperative, and some members was also low.

The main reasons for the high costs of these cooperatives are that they did not carefully calculate when investing, over-applied commercial fertilizers, or blindly engaged in sideline businesses and lost money. The second cooperative in Fumin Township is near the mountains and has the most green leaves. If more green manure is accumulated, less commercial fertilizer can be used, reducing costs; however, this cooperative does not accumulate green manure well and has to use more commercial fertilizer, resulting in high costs. Regardless of whether the feed was sufficient or not, the Longyan Cooperative spent 130 yuan to buy a house and raised 40 pigs, but because of the lack of feed, the pigs were not raised well, resulting in a loss of more than 300 yuan.

Now is the time to plan how to produce in the next year. Agricultural cooperatives in various places must base themselves on the principle of "running the cooperatives diligently and frugally" and carefully calculate production costs.

    要计算生产成本
    广东省阳春县一区的十六个农业生产合作社，今年作年终结算的时候，普遍发现农、副业的成本都过高了。如升平乡第一农业合作社，全年总收入一万二千三百九十七元，农、副业成本共五千一百八十一元，占总收入百分之四十一点七；第二社农、副业成本占总收入的百分之四十。崆峒乡第一社农、副业成本占总收入的百分之五十。由于成本高，社虽然增产了，但是社员收入少。如升平第二社增产二成，但是全社二十七户社员大多数比入社前减少了收入，社主任邱义广和一些社员的生产情绪也低落了。
    这些社成本高的主要原因，是投资的时候没有精打细算，过多地施用了商品肥料，或是盲目经营副业亏了本。扶民乡第二社靠山，绿叶最多，如果多堆绿肥，就可以少用商品肥料，减少成本；但是这个社不好好堆绿肥，只好多用商品肥料，结果成本高了。龙岩社不管饲料够不够，用
  一百三十元买了一间房子，养了四十头猪，结果因为缺乏饲料，猪没养好，亏本三百多元。
    现在正是计划下一年度怎样生产的时候，各地的农业合作社要本着“勤俭办社”的方针，好好计算生产成本。
