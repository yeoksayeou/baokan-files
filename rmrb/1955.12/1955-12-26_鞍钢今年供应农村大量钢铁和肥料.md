Anshan Iron and Steel Company's supply of steel for manufacturing agricultural machinery to all parts of the country in the first eleven months of this year has more than doubled the supply of last year. This amount of steel is enough to manufacture 550,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows. During the same period, Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant also supplied more than 30,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to all parts of the country, enough for 3 million mu of farmland.

This year, more than 20 units including the Lüda Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory, and the Yanbian Farm Tool Factory directly obtained more than 10,000 tons of pig iron, medium plate, thin plate, and various types of steel from Anshan Iron and Steel for manufacturing agricultural machinery. In addition, Anshan Iron and Steel Company also transported more than 40,000 tons of steel to more than 30 regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Gansu, and Guangdong. Units such as Shanghai Pesticide Factory and Shenyang Chemical Plant also purchased large quantities of pesticide raw materials such as benzene, xylene, and crude carbolic acid from Anshan Iron and Steel.

In order to support the agricultural cooperative movement, Anshan Iron and Steel employees are preparing to produce more than 3,000 tons of steel and more than 4,000 tons of chemical fertilizer in December to supply the rural areas.

    鞍钢今年供应农村大量钢铁和肥料
    在今年头十一个月内，鞍山钢铁公司供应全国各地制造农业机具用的钢铁已经超出去年供应量的二倍多。这些钢铁足够制造五十五万台双轮双铧犁。同一时期，鞍钢化工总厂还供应全国各地化学肥料三万多吨，可供三百万亩农田使用。
    今年旅大农业机械厂、沈阳农具厂、延边农具厂等二十多个单位，直接从鞍钢获得的制造农业机具用的生铁、中板、薄板和各种型钢有一万多吨。另外，鞍山钢铁公司还有四万多吨钢铁运送到北京、天津、上海、西安、甘肃、广东等三十多个地区。上海农药厂、沈阳化工厂等单位，还从鞍钢购去了纯苯、二甲苯、焦油酸等大量农药原料。
    为了支援农业合作化运动，鞍钢职工们准备在十二月份内，再生产三千多吨钢铁和四千多吨化学肥料来供应农村。
