As a result of the autumn harvest distribution in the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shuiquan Village in the suburbs of Shenyang, a group of elderly, weak, disabled, and sick members who joined the cooperative this spring all increased their income. The main reason for the increase in their income is that the cooperative arranged appropriate work for them. For example, during the autumn harvest, the cooperative organized nine elderly people aged fifty to sixty, into an elderly group; they were assigned the task of harvesting 160 mu of land that was both nearby and flat. The elderly group not only completed the harvesting task, but also selected 6,000 jin of seeds. They worked many labor days, and their income increased accordingly. They happily said, "Young people work like a whirlwind, but we are slow and meticulous." Jin Changlun, a lower-middle peasant who is elderly and has a leg disease, cannot do farm work. The cooperative assigned him to herd cattle. This year, the family's income was more than 400 yuan, which repaid the foreign debts owed for many years. They also retained enough grain for the coming year, and still had a surplus.

During the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, many elderly, weak, disabled, and sick farmers also requested to join the cooperatives. However, some rural staff members believed that they "could eat but could not work," and that absorbing them would be a "burden" on the cooperative, and were unwilling to accept them. The above facts prove that many elderly, weak, disabled, and sick people are not people who "can eat but cannot work." As long as the cooperative appropriately organizes them for production, they can still rely on their own efforts to improve their own lives. District and township staff should actively help them join the cooperatives, and help the cooperatives appropriately arrange their work.

    帮助老弱残疾的人入社
    沈阳市郊区水泉村和平农业生产合作社秋收分配的结果，今年春天入社的一批老、弱、残、病的社员都增加了收入。他们的收入所以增加，主要是因为合作社给他们安排了适当的工作。比如，在秋收的时候，合作社把九个五十岁到六十多岁的老年人，组织了一个老年组；把又近又平的一百六十亩地的收割工作分配给他们做。老年组不仅完成了收割任务，还选出了六千斤种子。他们做了许多劳动日，收入也就增加了。他们高兴地说：“小伙子干活一溜风，咱们是慢工出细活。”老年的下中农金常伦腿有病，不能干庄稼活。合作社分配他放牛。今年全家收入四百多元，还了多年欠下的外债，留了明年的口粮，还有剩余。
    在农业生产合作社大发展的时候，许多老弱残病的农民也纷纷要求入社，但是有些乡村工作人员认为他们“能吃不能干”，吸收了是社的“累赘”，不愿吸收他们入社。上面的事实证明，许多老弱残病的人，并不是“能吃不能干”的人，只要合作社恰当地组织他们进行生产，他们还是可以依靠自己的力量来改善自己的生活的。区乡工作人员，应该积极帮助他们入社，并帮助合作社适当安排他们的工作。
