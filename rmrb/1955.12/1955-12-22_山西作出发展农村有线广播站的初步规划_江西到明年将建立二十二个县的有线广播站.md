    Shanxi Makes Preliminary Plan for Developing Rural Wired Broadcasting Stations
    Jiangxi to Establish Wired Broadcasting Stations in Twenty-Two Counties by Next Year
    Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station, in accordance with the overall planning requirements of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for rural work, has also made preliminary overall planning for the province's rural radio broadcasting undertaking. The preliminary outline of the plan is: by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1962), to establish wired broadcasting stations in all 95 counties of the province in stages and batches, installing a total of 182,000 small loudspeakers for listening to broadcasts, with an average of about 2,000 small loudspeakers installed in each county, achieving more than one loudspeaker in every village and every cooperative. After the start of the Third Five-Year Plan, branch stations of broadcasting stations will be established in larger advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and loudspeakers will be gradually installed in farmers' courtyards and homes.
    The wired broadcasting stations established this year in five counties including Lu'an and Yuci are under intense construction, each station carrying 400 small loudspeakers. Fifteen broadcasting stations planned to be established in 1956 are also being planned. While planning rural wired broadcasting, the wired broadcasting stations in five cities including Taiyuan and Datong also plan to add 77,000 loudspeakers by the end of 1962 to meet the needs of farmers in suburban areas to listen to broadcasts.

    Jiangxi People's Broadcasting Station has decided to establish rural wired broadcasting stations in twenty-two counties throughout the province by 1956. The province's first rural wired broadcasting station, established in Gao'an County, began broadcasting on November 22, marking the beginning of Jiangxi Province's broadcasting undertaking spreading from urban areas to rural areas.
    According to the experience of establishing a wired broadcasting station in Gao'an County, in county towns with power equipment, using existing local telephone lines and existing rural material equipment (including loudspeakers, etc.), it only costs four to five thousand yuan to build a rural wired broadcasting station that can carry 200 to 250 loudspeakers. If you buy two hundred radios, it will cost more than ten times the funds spent to build a wired broadcasting station with two hundred loudspeakers.
    Jiangxi Province has many favorable conditions for developing rural wired broadcasting. There are currently radio receiving stations in eighty-one counties throughout the province, wired broadcasting stations in fifty towns, and radio receiving stations in more than four hundred and fifty agricultural production cooperatives. In these areas, there are already a considerable number of broadcasting and radio receiving workers with certain work experience and professional and technical knowledge. According to incomplete statistics, the existing loudspeakers total 10,895 watts, with loudspeakers in thirty-three counties exceeding 100 watts, and power equipment in more than seventy counties. Telephone lines in the vast majority of counties extend to districts and townships. By fully utilizing and developing these favorable conditions, coupled with the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for the broadcasting undertaking, it is entirely possible to popularize broadcasting to the vast rural areas within a few years.

    山西作出发展农村有线广播站的初步规划
    江西到明年将建立二十二个县的有线广播站
    山西人民广播电台根据中共山西省委对于农村工作的全面总体规划的要求，对全省农村的无线电广播事业也作了初步的全面规划。规划的初步轮廓是：到第二个五年计划末（一九六二年）分期分批地把全省九十五个县的有线广播站建立起来，共安装收听广播的小喇叭十八万二千个，平均每县安装小喇叭两千个左右，达到村村有、社社有一个以上的喇叭。在第三个五年计划开始后，即在较大的高级农业生产合作社中建立广播站的分站，并逐步在农户院落中和农户家中安装喇叭。
    今年在潞安、榆次等五个县建立的有线广播站，正在紧张施工，每站各带小喇叭四百个。计划在一九五六年建立的十五个广播站，也正在筹建中。在规划农村有线广播的同时，太原、大同等五个城市的有线广播站，也计划到一九六二年末增设喇叭七万七千个，以满足郊区农民收听广播的要求。

    江西人民广播电台确定到一九五六年在全省建立二十二个县的农村有线广播站。在高安县建立起来的全省第一个农村有线广播站，已在十一月二十二日开始播音，这是江西省广播事业从城市普及到农村的开端。
    根据高安县建立有线广播站的经验，在有电源设备的县城，利用现有的地方电话线路和农村现有的物质设备（包括扩音机等），建设一个能带动二百到二百五十个喇叭的农村有线广播站，只要四、五千元就够了。如果买二百部收音机，就比建立一个安装有二百个喇叭的有线广播站所耗费的资金多十倍以上。
    江西省发展农村有线广播有许多有利条件。全省现有八十一个县有收音站，五十个城镇有有线广播站，四百五十多个农业生产合作社有收音站。在这些地区已经有了相当数量的、具有一定工作经验和业务、技术知识的广播收音工作干部。现有的扩音机，据不完全统计，总共有一万零八百九十五瓦，有三十三个县的扩音机在一百瓦以上，七十多个县有电源设备。绝大多数县的电话线路通达区乡。把这些有利条件充分利用和发挥，加上广大农民对广播事业的积极性，几年之内，完全可能把广播普及到广大农村中去。（本报驻南昌记者）
