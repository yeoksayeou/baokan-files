    Henan Develops a Large Number of Mutual Aid Teams and Joint Teams

    In Henan Province, agricultural production mutual aid teams have greatly developed during the large-scale agricultural cooperativization movement. According to incomplete statistics from six special districts including Nanyang, Xinyang, and Anyang, more than 87,800 new mutual aid teams of various types have been established. In addition, a number of mutual aid teams that had collapsed have been restored. While consolidating old cooperatives and developing new ones, Nanyang Special District developed and restored a large number of mutual aid teams, with organized farmers accounting for 80 percent of the district.

    Currently, tens of thousands of mutual aid teams across the province are actively merging and expanding teams to create conditions for transitioning to cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from six special districts including Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Xinyang, more than 44,300 agricultural production cooperative frameworks have recently been set up around mutual aid teams, absorbing individual farmers. There are also more than 14,100 joint teams formed by merging mutual aid teams. (Dang Dianfu)

    河南发展大批互助组和联合组
    河南省各地农业生产互助组在大规模的农业合作化运动中有了很大发展。据南阳、信阳、安阳等六个专区的不完全统计，新建立的各种类型的互助组有八万七千八百多个，另外还恢复了一批已经垮台的互助组。南阳专区在整顿老社和发展新社的同时，发展和恢复了大批互助组，全区组织起来的农户已经占百分之八十。
    目前，全省成千上万的互助组正在积极并组、扩组，为转社创造条件。据开封、洛阳、信阳等六个专区的不完全统计，最近以互助组为核心，吸收单干户搭起来的农业生产合作社的架子，有四万四千三百多个，由互助组合并成的联组，有一万四千一百多个。（党殿富）
