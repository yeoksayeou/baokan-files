As if Entering "No Man's Land"
Editor:
    On November 7th, I went to the Anxin County Public Security Bureau in Hebei Province on business. I shouted a few times in the front yard, but no one answered. I went to the back yard, and still didn't find anyone. I looked up and saw a sign on the west wing door that read "Secretary's Office," and thought that there must be someone on duty here, so I knocked on the door and asked, "Is anyone inside?" But there was still no response. I went into the room and saw that the table was full of things, but there was no one working. After waiting for half an hour, I became impatient and shouted loudly in the yard. Soon, a comrade came out from some corner. I told him the purpose of my visit, and he called out another comrade to help me get things done.
    A public security organ has actually become a "no man's land," where people can wander around at will! This situation is intolerable. The Anxin County Public Security Bureau should examine their complacency.

Why Issue Blank Letters of Introduction?
Editor:
    In mid-September, Zhou Xuenian, a purchasing agent from the Nanjing City Company of the China Hardware and Machinery Company, went to Jingjiang County People's Committee in Jiangsu Province to negotiate the purchase of "cotton waste." When the comrade from Jingjiang County People's Committee who received him asked for a letter of introduction, he pulled out a blank letter of introduction stamped with the company's official seal from his pocket and filled it out himself. The receiving comrade found this very suspicious and reported it to the secretary's office. After repeated questioning, he produced a trade union membership card to prove his identity. The County People's Committee then made a long-distance call to Nanjing to inquire and found out that the company did indeed have a purchasing agent named "Zhou Xuenian."
    I believe that giving blank letters of introduction to staff members to carry with them may allow bad elements to exploit loopholes and cause losses to our work. The Nanjing Hardware and Machinery Company should quickly correct this practice.

Confidential Documents Auctioned off with Scrap Wooden Crates
Editor:
    On August 30th, the North China Baotou Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering auctioned off a batch of old wooden crates. I bought two of them. When I got home, I saw that one of the crates contained more than 100 military confidential documents, Party materials, and letters of introduction. It turned out that when our company was adjusting its organization, many staff members were transferred to other jobs. They did not inspect and sort out the confidential documents, but irresponsibly threw them around, so that no one cared about them afterward. If it hadn't been for this disposal of old wooden crates, these documents would not have been found.
    I believe that this situation is extremely dangerous. I suggest that the company leadership investigate this matter and deal with it seriously.

Do Not Use Flashlights with Colored Bulbs Near Railways
Editor:
    Currently, some flashlight bulbs sold on the market are red or green. Some people use flashlights with colored bulbs in train stations or near railways. Because these colored lights can easily be confused with train traffic signals—like green lights mean go and red lights mean stop—they can cause train accidents.
    I suggest that everyone not use flashlights with colored bulbs near railways. I also hope that relevant commercial units will explain this to buyers when selling colored bulbs.

    克服麻痹思想，堵塞一切漏洞
    如入“无人之境”编辑同志：
    十一月七日，我有事到河北省安新县公安局。走进前院，我喊了几声，没人回答。走进后院，同样没有发现人影。我抬头看到西厢房门上挂着“秘书室”的牌子，心想这里准会有人值班，就敲门问：“里边有人吗？”结果还是没有回声。我走进屋子，一看桌上摆满了东西，只是缺少办公的人。等了半个钟头，我实在不耐烦了，就到院子里大声喊叫。不久，不知从那个角落里出来一位同志。我告诉他来这里的目的，他才把另外一位同志叫出来，让我办妥了事情。
    一个公安机关，居然成为“无人之境”，可以让人随便东闯西窜！这种情况是令人不能容忍的。安新县公安局应该检查他们的麻痹思想。

    为什么要开空白介绍信编辑同志：
    九月中旬，中国五金机械公司南京市公司采购员周雪年到江苏省靖江县人民委员会接洽采购“棉纱头”的事情。当靖江县人民委员会接待他的同志向他要介绍信的时候，他在身上摸出一本盖好公司长戳的空白介绍信，自己填写了一张；接待同志看见这种情况，感到很可疑，就报告秘书室。经再三盘问，他拿出了工会会员证证明他的身份。县人民委员会又挂了长途电话到南京询问，才弄清楚这个公司确实有名叫“周雪年”的采购员。
    我认为，把空白介绍信交给外出的工作人员随身携带，很可能让坏分子钻空子，使我们的工作受到损失。南京市五金机械公司应该迅速纠正这种作法。　刘鸿桢
    机密文件同废木箱一起拍卖了编辑同志：
    八月三十日，建筑工程部华北包头工程总公司拍卖一批旧的木箱子，我也买了两个。拿回家去一看，其中一个箱子里竟装着有关军事机密的文件、党内材料和介绍信等共一百多件。原来我们公司在调整机构的时候，不少工作人员调动了工作，他们对机密文件没有进行检查和清理，却不负责任地乱扔乱放，以致过后就无人过问了。如果不是这一次处理旧木箱，这些文件还不会被找出来。
    我认为这种情况是极端危险的。建议公司领导方面检查这件事，并作严肃处理。

    在铁路附近不要使用有带色灯泡的手电筒编辑同志：
    目前市上出卖的手电筒灯泡，有一些是红色的或绿色的。有些人把这种有带色灯泡的手电筒拿到车站里或铁路附近使用。因为这种带色的灯光容易和火车行车信号相混淆——像绿灯是开车信号，红灯是停车信号，因而就可能使火车出事故。
    我建议大家不要在铁路附近使用这种有带色灯泡的手电筒，同时希望有关商业单位在出售带色灯泡的时候也向购买者说清这一点。
