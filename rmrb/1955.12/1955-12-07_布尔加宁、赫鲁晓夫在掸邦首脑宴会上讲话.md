Xinhua News Agency, Dongzhi, December 4th (Delayed Dispatch): According to TASS, the Shan State leader, Sao Kunhkio, held a banquet on the evening of the 3rd to entertain the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev. Attending the reception were leaders of the Shan State government—ministers of various departments, members of the Legislative Assembly, and other officials.

    As the banquet was nearing its end, Sao Kunhkio raised his glass to congratulate the Soviet leaders on their visit to Shan State and expressed his hope that the visit of the Soviet leaders would consolidate the friendship and cooperation between Myanmar and the Soviet Union.

    Bulganin, in his reply, said that this place is separated from Moscow by thousands of miles. However, the people of our two countries are still friends. The common desire to strive for peace and friendship between all peoples unites them.

    Khrushchev then delivered a speech. He said: We are very pleased to feel the love and sincere feelings of the Myanmar people for the Soviet people and for our country, the brothers. I think the reason this love has arisen is because the people of our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have seized power and built a powerful socialist country. The Soviet people have shown the world what the working people, fighting for their own vital interests, for their freedom and independence, and for their motherland, are capable of doing.

    Khrushchev said that some bourgeois newspapers are angry with me for my speeches in India and Myanmar. However, I am not speaking here to please them. Why are they dissatisfied? Because I cannot speak approvingly of the colonialists. Foreign colonialists have been riding on your necks for decades, plundering your country. They say they did this to improve the civilization of the Myanmar people. We say differently. The colonialists were entrenched in your country to plunder your people, to take the last piece of bread from your people's hands. That is why the newspapers in some countries do not like these words. Good medicine tastes bitter. But I am not a person who goes against my conscience. I represent the working people and the Communist Party, and therefore I can never speak for the colonialists.

    Khrushchev went on to say that the Soviet people are sincerely happy that you have overthrown colonial oppression and are now building your own independent country. We are ready to help you develop so that the colonialists can never ride on your necks again. We hope that you will work for yourselves, for your children, and improve your cultural level. We hope that you will be strong and independent.

    This is our heartfelt wish for you. Only those who have themselves been oppressed can express such a wish. I myself come from a working-class background. Before the revolution in Russia, I worked for British, French, and other countries' capitalists, who had their factories and mines in the Donbas. Therefore, I know what it is like to work for foreigners. That is why I understand the joy of your liberation so clearly.

    The Soviet people are happy for your success. We are willing to get along with you as brothers, and we have no other desire than to have your friendship. But we can help each other. We can help you, and you can help us. Your country is a young country. You do not yet have the necessary experience. If you need help, just tell us and we will help you. We will send engineers to help you and introduce our experience to you.

    He said that in order to maintain the power that has been achieved, the most important thing is to cultivate your own cadres, to have engineers, scientists, and experts in various economic sectors. You should cultivate this force from among your own people. We hope that you will be successful in this work.

    Khrushchev said that the colonialists tell the people they enslave that the people of the colonies are not capable of managing their own countries. They try to make people believe this lie in order to keep them at their mercy. Are the people of Myanmar not as capable as the Russians and the British? People are not divided into capable and incapable. If they are given equal opportunities, then they can all achieve success in their development.

    Some bourgeois journalists dislike me precisely because of these words. But as long as my heart is beating, I will always tell the truth. I will tirelessly tell the truth and mobilize people to fight against falsehood. This is a noble task, and everyone should strive for this purpose.

    The reception concluded with performances of national music and dance.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫在掸邦首脑宴会上讲话
    新华社六日讯　据塔斯社东枝四日讯（迟发）：缅甸掸邦首脑藻昆卓在三日晚上举行宴会，招待苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。出席招待会的有掸邦政府领导人——各部部长，立法议会议员和其他官员。
    在宴会快要结束的时候，藻昆卓举杯祝贺前来掸邦访问的苏联领导人，并且表示希望，苏联领导人的访问将巩固缅苏两国之间的友谊和合作。
    布尔加宁致答词说，这里同莫斯科相隔千山万水。但是，我们两国人民仍然是朋友。争取和平和各国人民之间的友谊的共同愿望把他们团结起来了。
    赫鲁晓夫接着发表讲话。他说：我们非常愉快地感觉到缅甸人民对苏联人民、对我们国家的兄弟的爱和真诚的感情。我认为，这种爱之所以产生，是因为我国人民在共产党的领导之下取得了政权，建成了强大的社会主义国家。苏联人民向全世界表明了，为自己的切身利益、为自己的自由和独立、为自己的祖国而奋斗的劳动人民能够做出什么样的事情来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，有些资产阶级报纸为了我在印度和缅甸的讲话而对我发怒。但是，我在这里讲话，并不是为了讨他们的喜欢。为什么他们不满意呢？因为我不能用赞同的口吻来谈殖民主义者。外国殖民主义者骑在你们脖子上有好几十年，掠夺了你们国家。他们说，所以这样做，是为了提高缅甸人民的文明。我们的说法则不同，殖民主义者盘据在你们国家里是为了掠夺你们的人民，为了从你们的人民手中夺取他们的最后一块面包。这就是为什么有些国家的报纸不喜欢这样的话。良药是苦口的。但是我不是一个昧着良心的人，我代表着劳动人民和共产党，因此决不能为殖民主义者说话。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联人民衷心高兴的是，你们推翻了殖民压迫，现在正在建设自己独立的国家。我们准备帮助你们的发展，使殖民主义者永远不能再骑在你们脖子上。我们希望你们为自己劳动，为自己的孩子劳动，提高自己的文化水平，我们希望你们强盛和独立。
    这是我们对你们衷心的期望。只有自己也曾经是受压迫的人才能表达这样的期望。我自己是工人出身。在革命前的俄国我替英国、法国以及其他国家的资本家做过工，这些资本家在顿巴斯有他们的工厂和矿场，因此我知道，替外国人做工是怎么一回事。这就是为什么我这样清楚地领会到你们的解放的快乐。
    苏联人民为你们的成功感到高兴。我们愿意同你们兄弟般相处，我们除了希望得到你们的友谊之外，再没有任何希求。但是，我们可以互相帮助，我们可以帮助你们，你们也可以帮助我们。你们的国家是一个年青的国家。你们现在还没有必要的经验。如果你们需要帮助的话，只要告诉我们，我们就帮助你们。我们将派工程师帮助你们，把我们的经验介绍给你们。
    他说，为了保持已取得的政权，最主要的就是必须培养本国的干部，要有工程师、科学家以及各经济部门的专家。你们应该从自己的人民中间培养出这支力量。我们希望你们在这一工作上取得成功。
    赫鲁晓夫说，殖民主义者向被他们奴役的人民说，殖民地的人民没有能力管理自己的国家。他们竭力要使人民相信这种谎话，以使人民听任他们摆布。难道缅甸人不是像俄罗斯人和英国人一样有能力的人吗？人民并不分成有能力的和没有能力的。如果他们获得同等的机会，那么他们都能够在自己的发展中获得成就。
    某些资产阶级记者所以不喜欢我，正是为了这样一些话。但是只要我的心在跳动，我总要说真话。我要不倦地说真话，发动人们去反对虚假。这是崇高的任务，每个人都应当为这个目的而尽力。
    招待会最后举行了民族音乐和舞蹈表演。
