Deep Brotherly Friendship
By Our Reporter

    One hundred and two years ago, a great German wrote: "In China, there have been continuous uprisings for ten years, and now they have merged into a powerful revolution." This great German was Karl Marx. Later, through the Russian October Socialist Revolution, Marxism was introduced into China, blossomed, and bore fruit on the great soil of China. The Chinese revolution was victorious. At almost the same time, the German people established the first German state in history with the laboring people in power—the German Democratic Republic.

    On December 11, 1955, people from all walks of life in Beijing held a mass rally to welcome the government delegation from this newborn German state, led by Prime Minister Grotewohl. At the meeting, Prime Minister Grotewohl returned to China the ten free banners of the Boxer Rebellion and the three volumes of the Yongle Encyclopedia of the Ming Dynasty, which were seized from the Chinese people by German imperialists in 1900. Prime Minister Grotewohl said: "German militarists, the bloody enemies of the Chinese people, seized these banners. The German socialists, the descendants of Marx and Engels, the faithful friends and comrades of the Chinese people, return them to you and hand them over to you." Amidst stormy applause and cheers, our Premier Zhou Enlai took over a banner of freedom, as if the embodiment of the 600 million Chinese people who had stood up, and held this banner of freedom high. The prime ministers of China and Germany shook hands tightly, and the two prime ministers embraced warmly, symbolizing the close friendship between the brotherly peoples of China and Germany.

    Indeed, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, the outstanding descendants of Marx and Engels, have come to our China, and today they are writing a new page in the history of friendship between the two peoples after they established their respective worker-peasant states. In the past few days, the delegation visited schools and factories in Beijing. Everywhere, one could strongly feel the growing friendship between the two peoples.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl visited the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. All the spinning machines in this factory came from the German Democratic Republic. And during the installation of the machines, five experts came from faraway Germany to provide technical guidance. Yang Huijie, the female director of the cotton mill, thanked the German Democratic Republic for its assistance on behalf of all the workers in the factory. The director praised the machines from the German Democratic Republic. Speaking of the machines, Prime Minister Grotewohl smiled and said: "Machines are dead; they can only become alive with the capable labor of the workers. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the excellent Chinese workers standing next to the German machines." Prime Minister Grotewohl encouraged the workers to study Marxism-Leninism and contribute to the cause of socialism with more effective and creative labor. In almost every workshop, workers put up big-character posters and blackboard newspapers to express their welcome. In the cone winding workshop, workers drew peace doves and two huge hands clasped tightly on the blackboard, and wrote: "Long live the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Germany!" Prime Minister Grotewohl was very moved and added a few German words on the blackboard to respond to the workers' enthusiasm:

    "Thank you. Forward to Socialism!"

    Prime Minister Grotewohl and members of the delegation visited Tsinghua University. They were warmly welcomed by the teachers and students of Tsinghua University. As he walked out of the hydraulic laboratory, Prime Minister Grotewohl said to a group of students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering: "Your country has many, many wide rivers. I hope you will study hard and develop them in the future to build a greater, stronger, and more beautiful China." A student from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering excitedly replied: "We will firmly remember the words of Prime Minister Grotewohl. We will build great hydropower stations like Kuibyshev and Stalingrad on the great Yellow River of our motherland."

    More than half of the scientific instruments in the "Tolerance and Technical Measurement Room" of the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Tsinghua University are from the German Democratic Republic. When Prime Minister Grotewohl visited here, he said: "We are very happy that we can provide you with these instruments, because our friendship lies here." Prime Minister Grotewohl said with unwavering confidence: "All these instruments, you will be able to manufacture yourselves before long." Yes, with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and other fraternal countries, the Chinese people will surely be able to quickly master the latest industrial technology.

    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, visited the Wilhelm Pieck Class of Beijing No. 65 Middle School. This class was named Pieck Class on January 23, 1953. Since then, the name of President Wilhelm Pieck has inspired these middle school students. The children received a letter from the Office of the President of the German Democratic Republic, conveying President Pieck's expectations of them. President Pieck told the children: "I hope you will be among the best students in your free and strong worker-peasant state." The children have not disappointed President Pieck's expectations. They reported their achievements to the visiting Deputy Prime Minister Bolz. The average grade of all forty-nine students in their class is above four points. They won collective awards in sports meets and won awards in literary and art competitions. Their slogan is "The class collectively advances!" They are determined not to let any of them fall behind. Thirty-nine of the forty-nine students have joined the Communist Youth League... They include talented young painters, accordion players, small technicians who make crystal radios, and amateur photography enthusiasts. They live a happy, meaningful, and rich learning life.

    Deputy Prime Minister Bolz brought the friendship of German youth to the children of the Pieck Class, and brought President Pieck's greetings and care. The students of the Pieck Class shouted: "Pieck - Mao Zedong," and sang the German songs "Song of the Blue Flag" and "Friendship, Unity, and Peace." Zheng Chuntang, a capable "crystal radio manufacturer" from the Pieck Class, presented a crystal radio, jointly made by several amateur "manufacturers" over several nights, to Deputy Prime Minister Bolz. Two other students presented their excellent medals as precious gifts.

    The students of the Pieck Class love Wilhelm Pieck, the respected leader of the German people and the old fighter of world communism. As President Pieck's 80th birthday approaches, they are rushing to make birthday gifts. Tu Shungeng, the talented "painter" of the Pieck Class, is painting a charcoal portrait of President Pieck, which only needs the final touches to be completed.

    Indeed, so many such scenes are so unforgettable! During the short few days of their stay in Beijing, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, has left a deep memory of the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples. The Chinese people will infinitely cherish these beautiful memories. As Premier Zhou Enlai said, the Chinese people will always cherish this friendship like protecting their own eyes. At the rally to welcome the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Kang Zugui, a worker from a firewood factory, told reporters his thoughts. He said:

    "The brotherly friendship between the people of China and Germany is unbreakable. We thank the German Democratic Republic for its help in our socialist construction; we Chinese people also have a responsibility to support the German people's just struggle for national reunification!" This ordinary Chinese worker's words well illustrate the deep brotherly friendship between the Chinese and German peoples.

    深厚的兄弟友谊
    本报记者
    一百零二年以前，一个伟大的德国人曾经写道：“在中国，起义连绵不断，已有十年之久，而且现在已汇合成为一种强有力的革命。”这个伟大的德国人就是卡尔·马克思。后来，经由俄国十月社会主义革命，马克思主义传入中国，在中国的伟大的土壤上开了花，结了果。中国革命胜利了。差不多在同一个时候，德国人民建立起历史上第一个由劳动人民掌握政权的德意志国家——德意志民主共和国。
    一九五五年十二月十一日，北京市各界人民举行了群众大会，欢迎从这个新生的德意志国家来的、由格罗提渥总理率领的政府代表团。在大会上，格罗提渥总理把一九○○年德国帝国主义者从中国人民手中抢去的义和团起义的十面自由旗帜和明代的三部永乐大典归还给中国。格罗提渥总理说：“德国军国主义者，中国人民的血腥的敌人，曾夺取了这些旗帜，德国的社会主义者，马克思和恩格斯的子孙，中国人民的忠实朋友和战友把它们还给了你们，并交给你们手中。”我国周恩来总理在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中接过了一面自由大旗，好像站起来了的六亿中国人民的化身，把这面自由大旗高高地擎起。中德两国总理紧紧地握手，两个总理热烈地拥抱在一起，象征着中德两国兄弟人民之间的亲密的友谊。
    的确，民主德国政府代表团，优秀的马克思和恩格斯的子孙，来到我们中国，他们今天是在写着两国人民在各自建立了工农国家后友谊历史的新篇页。这几天，代表团访问了北京的学校和工厂。随处都可以强烈地感触到两国人民之间不断增长着的友谊。
    格罗提渥总理访问了国营北京第一棉纺织厂。这个厂的全程纺纱机器全部来自民主德国。并且在机器安装时，从遥远的德国来了五位专家进行技术指导。棉纺厂的女厂长杨慧洁代表全厂职工感谢民主德国的援助。厂长赞扬民主德国的机器。谈到机器，格罗提渥总理微笑着说：“机器是死的，它只有依靠了工人的能干的劳动才会变成活的。我们向站在德国机器旁边的优秀的中国工人致以衷心的祝贺。”格罗提渥总理勉励工人们学习马克思列宁主义，用更有成效的创造性的劳动贡献给社会主义的事业。几乎每一个车间，工人们都出了大字报和黑板报表示欢迎。在筒摇成车间，工人在黑板上画着和平鸽和两只紧握着的巨大的手，并且写着：“中德两国人民兄弟友谊万岁！”格罗提渥总理看了很感动，他在黑板上添了几个德文字以回答工人们的热情：
    “谢谢。向社会主义前进！”
    格罗提渥总理和代表团的团员们参观了清华大学。他们受到了清华大学师生的热情欢迎。在走出水利实验馆时，格罗提渥总理对水利系的一群学生说：“你们的国家有着很多很多宽广的河流，希望你们努力学习，将来开发它们，把伟大的中国建设得更加富强和美丽。”一个水利系学生兴奋地回答说：“我们将牢牢地记住格罗提渥总理的话。我们要在祖国的伟大的黄河，建设起像古比雪夫和斯大林格勒那样伟大的水电站。”
    清华大学机械制造系的“公差及技术测量屋”里的科学仪器有一半以上是来自民主德国的。格罗提渥总理参观到这里的时候说：“我们很高兴，我们能够给你们提供这些仪器，因为这里就有着我们之间的友谊。”格罗提渥总理深信不疑地说：“所有这些仪器，要不了很久，你们都会自己制造的。”是的，有着苏联、德意志民主共和国以及其他兄弟国家的热情的帮助，中国人民一定能够迅速地掌握最新的工业技术。
    民主德国副总理兼外交部长博尔茨访问了北京市第六十五中学的威廉·皮克班。这个班是一九五三年一月二十三日命名为皮克班的。自此以后，威廉·皮克总统的名字鼓舞着这些中学生。孩子们接到民主德国总统办公厅的信，转达皮克总统对他们的期望。皮克总统向孩子们说：“希望你们置身于你们自由强大的工农国家的最优秀的学生行列中”。孩子们没有辜负皮克总统的期望。他们向来访的博尔茨副总理汇报他们的成绩。他们全班四十九个学生平均成绩在四分以上，他们在运动会上获得了集体奖状，在文艺比赛中获得了优胜。他们的口号是“班集体前进！”他们坚决不让他们中间的任何一个掉队和落后。四十九个学生中，三十九个参加了青年团……。他们中间有着有才能的小画家、手风琴手、制造矿石机的小技师、业余的摄影爱好者。他们愉快地过着有意义的、丰富的学习生活。
    博尔茨副总理给皮克班的孩子们带来了德国青年的友谊，带来了皮克总统的问候和关怀。皮克班的学生们高呼：“皮克——毛泽东”，他们高声地唱着德国的歌曲“蓝旗歌”和“友谊、统一与和平”之歌。皮克班的学员、一个能干的“矿石机制造家”郑春堂把他们几个业余“制造家”在几个夜晚合伙制造的一架矿石机赠送给博尔茨副总理，另外两个学生把自己的优良奖章作为珍贵的赠礼。
    皮克班的同学们热爱德国人民敬爱的领袖、世界共产主义的老战士威廉·皮克。在皮克总统八十寿辰将临的时候，他们正在赶制着祝寿的礼物。皮克班的有才能的“画家”屠舜耕正在画着一张皮克总统的炭画像，这张画像只需要最后的加工就能完成了。
    真的，许多这样的情景是多么地令人难忘呵！以格罗提渥总理为首的民主德国政府代表团在逗留北京的短短几天中，已经留下了中德两国人民友好的深刻记忆。中国人民将无限地珍爱这些美好的记忆，正像周恩来总理所说，中国人民将永远像保护眼珠一样地保护这种友谊。在欢迎民主德国政府代表团的大会上，木柴厂工人康祖贵向记者叙述了他的感想。他说：
    “中德两国人民的兄弟友谊是牢不可破的。我们感谢民主德国对我们社会主义建设的帮助；我们中国人民也有责任去支持德国人民争取祖国统一的正义斗争！”这个普通中国工人的话很好地说明了中德两国人民之间的深厚的兄弟友谊。
