Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, December 19th: Bulganin and Khrushchev held a reception on the evening of the 18th. Attending the reception were Afghan government officials headed by Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan, prominent figures from Afghanistan, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Kabul.

Bulganin spoke at the reception. He said that our visit is coming to an end. During our short stay in Kabul, we have learned about some aspects of life in your capital and have carried out significant and beneficial work with you. In our friendly and sincere talks, we discussed the possibilities and ways to further develop cooperation and ties between our two countries, and exchanged views on extremely important international issues.

Bulganin then talked about the just-signed joint statement between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, the protocol on extending the Soviet-Afghan Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression, and the joint communique on Soviet-Afghan economic relations.

Bulganin said that the most important result of our visit is that we have gained a deeper understanding of each other and have full mutual understanding and consensus. On many issues, we also have clear plans for cooperation. These are new factors that promote our good-neighborly relations and the friendship between the Soviet and Afghan peoples. The successful development of Soviet-Afghan relations proves that the policies pursued by those who oppose peaceful coexistence and the friendship and cooperation of all peoples are untenable.

Bulganin concluded by saying: Direct contact between national leaders greatly contributes to friendly relations between countries and between our two countries. We have, on behalf of the Soviet government, invited the Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan to visit the Soviet Union at his convenience. The Prime Minister accepted the invitation and agreed to visit the Soviet Union in 1956. This visit and our future contacts will certainly help consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan delivered a reply speech, saying:

The days that our dear friends have stayed in our country are happy days for us. They will be leaving Afghanistan tomorrow, and we wish them a safe journey and good health. Their visit to our country and the negotiations we have conducted here are a good sign for the further development of Soviet-Afghan relations.

Those attending the reception responded with stormy applause to the speeches of Bulganin and Daoud Khan.

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫举行招待会
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔十九日讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫十八日晚间举行招待会。出席招待会的有以穆罕默德·达乌德汗首相为首的阿富汗政府人员、阿富汗著名人士以及各国驻喀布尔的外交使节。
    布尔加宁在招待会上讲了话。他说，我们的访问快要结束了。在我们访问喀布尔的不多的日子里，我们了解了你们首都生活的某些方面，并且同你们一起进行了巨大的和有益的工作。在我们友好恳切的会谈中，我们讨论了进一步发展我们两国之间的合作和联系的可能性和方法，并且就极重要的国际问题交换了彼此的看法。
    布尔加宁接着谈到刚刚签署的苏联和阿富汗两国联合声明、关于延长苏联—阿富汗中立和互不侵犯条约的议定书以及关于苏联同阿富汗的经济关系的联合公报。
    布尔加宁说，我们这次访问的最重要的结果是，我们彼此更加了解了我们有了充分的互相谅解和一致的看法，在许多问题上我们还有了明确的合作计划。这些都是促进我们的睦邻关系和促进苏联人民和阿富汗人民的友谊的新的因素。苏联—阿富汗关系的胜利发展，证明那些反对和平共处、反对各国人民友好和合作的人所实行的政策是站不住脚的。
    布尔加宁最后说：国家领导人物的直接接触在很大的程度上有助于各国之间和我们两国之间的友好关系。我们已经代表苏联政府邀请阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗在他认为方便的时候访问苏联。首相接受了这个邀请，并且同意在一九五六年访问苏联。这次访问和我们今后的接触一定有助于我们两国之间的友谊和合作的巩固和发展。
    穆罕默德·达乌德汗首相致答词说：
    我们的亲爱的朋友在我国逗留的日子是我们的幸福日子。他们明天就要离开阿富汗，我们祝他们一路平安和身体健康。他们到我国的访问和我们在这里所进行的谈判，是苏阿关系进一步发展的良好征兆。
    出席招待会的人对布尔加宁和达乌德汗的讲话不断报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    招待会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。
