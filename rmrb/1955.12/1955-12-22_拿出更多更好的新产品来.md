    Bring out more and better new products
    In recent years, China's industry has produced many new products. From 1954 to the third quarter of 1955, enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry successfully trial-produced 499 new varieties of steel, non-ferrous metals, basic chemicals, and building materials; enterprises within the First Ministry of Machine Building are expected to have successfully trial-produced 2,067 new products from 1953 to 1955. The numbers are even larger when the products successfully trial-produced by other economic types of machine factories are included; light industrial enterprises have also successfully trial-produced many new products that China could not produce in the past. What is particularly exciting is that China successfully trial-produced its first aircraft in 1954.
    What is the significance of successfully trial-producing so many kinds of new products? First of all, it has improved China's manufacturing capability and ensured the speed of industrial construction. During the long period of rule by imperialism and domestic reactionaries, China's modern industry lagged behind the advanced industrial countries of the world by a century or several decades. China's weak modern industry was heavily colored by colonialism and semi-colonialism, and lacked the ability to develop independently. This backward industrial foundation has caused many difficulties for China's socialist construction, the most important of which is the inability to use the original industry to supply the various products needed for large-scale construction. In order to overcome this difficulty, with the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in recent years, China has trial-produced and produced thousands of new products, most of which have gone from non-existent to existent, from manufacturing individual parts to manufacturing complete sets of machines, from several products to multiple products, from chaotic product specifications to partially standardized, and from backward technical standards to advanced technical standards. Taking various mechanical equipment as an example, China's manufacturing capacity was very small in the past, but now the mechanical equipment that we can supply ourselves accounts for 40% to 60% of the needs of the national economy. This shows that China's industry has begun to embark on the road of independent manufacturing and is beginning to lay the foundation for the future technical transformation of industry and agriculture in our country.
    Expanding the production of new products has further promoted the balance of industrial production and sales and strengthened cooperation between enterprises. Production and sales balance and cooperation between enterprises are important conditions for ensuring the development of the planned economy. Every enterprise must carry out production under the unified plan of the state, according to the needs of the state, obtain raw materials and equipment conditions from other enterprises according to the plan, and at the same time produce what other enterprises need. Only in this way can the development of production be ensured, and good economic results can be achieved in enterprise management. Due to the weak industrial foundation and low technical level in China in the past, a situation that violated the laws of the planned economy appeared in the process of production development: certain urgently needed products could not be produced, while products with small or no demand were produced in large quantities. As a result of increasing new products in recent years, the cooperation between industry and capital construction, the iron and steel industry and the machinery industry, light industry and heavy industry, and industry and agricultural production in our country has been strengthened. The mutual needs have been initially met, the production and sales tend to be balanced, foreign exchange has been saved, the capital turnover of enterprises has been accelerated, and more funds have been accumulated for the country. For example, when the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant produced old-fashioned products in 1953, the annual sales volume only accounted for 65% of the production volume. In 1954, the main production was new varieties, and the sales volume accounted for 80% of the production volume. In 1955, new varieties were added, and the products were in short supply. From an economic point of view, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant relied on bank credit in 1953 and paid nearly 200,000 yuan in interest for the whole year. In 1954, the interest paid was only 21,000 yuan. In 1955, it not only did not rely on loans but also had a surplus, and it is expected that the funds accumulated for the country will increase by 20% compared with last year.
    Actively increasing the manufacture of new products can also greatly promote enterprises to gradually carry out technical transformation, improve the technical level of enterprises, and tap the internal potential of enterprises. In order to increase new products and supply the needs of the national economy, it is impossible to completely rely on the original industry. It is necessary to establish necessary new enterprises, increase the proportion of large industry, master new technologies, and adjust the proportion of various products. However, the construction of new enterprises, especially heavy industry, takes a certain amount of time and cannot be put into production immediately. At present, we should mainly rely on the original enterprises in our country. In order to carry out the trial production and production of new products, many of the original enterprises in our country have carried out a number of reforms and constructions in addition to striving to learn new technologies and promote advanced experience, such as establishing and improving product design institutions, transforming or adding individual workshops, adjusting labor organizations, adding or replacing certain equipment, carrying out product serialization and standardization, formulating new technological regulations, adopting new technical standards and materials, using new tooling and inspection instruments, and strengthening scientific experiments and research in enterprises. Through these production and technical reforms and constructions, not only has the plan for the trial production and production of new products been guaranteed to be completed, but also the technical level of the enterprises has been further improved, and the potential capabilities of the enterprises have been brought into play. At present, in order to trial-produce and produce new products, various industrial enterprises in China are carrying out technical transformation of existing enterprises, laying the foundation for the establishment of China's independent manufacturing industry.
    Therefore, striving to develop the production of new industrial products, fully supplying the products needed for national construction, and promoting the technical transformation of industry and agriculture is a task of serious political and economic significance, and it is also an important indicator for assessing the production achievements of each industrial enterprise.
    However, there are currently many conservative ideas hindering the trial production and production of new products. Many enterprises cannot complete the plan for trial production and production of new products on time; the quality of many new products is very poor; some urgently needed products have not yet been trial-produced, and new backlogs have appeared in the successfully trial-produced products. In addition to objective difficulties, there are many subjective reasons for these shortcomings. For example, to this day, some industrial departments still do not have a comprehensive plan for new products, have not regarded the completion of this task as an important indicator for assessing the production achievements of their subordinate enterprises, the trial production institutions and systems for new products are not sound, and there are few timely inspections and summaries of this work, and the criticism of various incorrect ideas that hinder the development of this work is very poor; at the same time, the leading personnel of many enterprises do not fully understand the important significance of this work, or because of departmentalism, they are often forced to accept tasks and delay them repeatedly, which affects the needs of the users to complete the production and construction plans; some enterprises do not follow the formal trial production procedures at all, and carry out trial production sloppily, so that the product quality is not high, and it does not meet the design standards and the requirements of the users; other enterprises do not pay attention to economic benefits, and whenever there is a trial production task, they ask to add new workshops and new equipment, and they do not pay attention to saving materials, so that the cost of the product is too high. For example, the Dalian Steel Plant did not complete the trial production plan for new products in 1954. The task of trial-producing new varieties this year is quite heavy. Because Comrade Yuan Zhizhong, the former director of the plant, took a negative attitude towards this work and did not understand how big the trial production task this year was and what the content was, only one of the nine varieties that were started in the first half of the year was successfully trial-produced. In the second half of the year, although the plant has changed, it has lost half a year. Another example is the Dalian Crane Plant, which did not organize the trial production work well. Among the dozens of products trial-produced from January to the end of October, only two were completed on time. Most of them did not fulfill the delivery contract and were fined 200,000 yuan.
    Now, China's agricultural cooperation movement is developing on an unprecedented scale, and industry needs to quickly provide it with the conditions for technical transformation and promote industry to move forward rapidly. And the increasing development of socialist industrialization will inevitably greatly increase the demand for new products. Therefore, all industrial departments must vigorously carry out the work of trial production and production of new products, should actively use the technical assistance given to us by the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, rapidly expand the quantity of new products, and improve the quality of new products. Only in this way can we accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country and create favorable conditions for larger-scale industrial construction in the future. 1955 is about to pass. All industrial authorities should immediately conduct inspections and summaries of this work in the past, formulate a comprehensive plan to increase new products when formulating the 1956 production plan, establish and improve the trial production management institutions and systems for new products, guide all subordinate enterprises to take the most effective measures, strengthen the cooperation of various industrial departments, and strive to bring out more and better new products in the new year.

    拿出更多更好的新产品来
    我国工业几年来生产了许多新产品。重工业部所属的各企业，从一九五四年到一九五五年第三季度试制成功的钢铁、有色金属、基本化学、建筑材料等新品种有四百九十九种；第一机械工业部系统的各企业，从一九五三年到一九五五年，预计试制成功两千零六十七种新产品，加上其他经济类型的机器厂试制成功的产品，数字更大；轻工业企业也试制成功了许多我国过去不能生产的新产品。特别令人兴奋的，在一九五四年我国试制成功了第一架飞机。
    试制成功许多种类的新产品，有那些重要意义呢？这首先是提高了我国工业的制造能力，保证了工业建设的速度。在帝国主义和国内反动派长期统治的时候，我国的现代工业比世界上先进的工业国落后了一百年或几十年，我国微弱的现代工业涂上了浓厚的殖民地和半殖民地的色彩，没有独立发展的能力。这种落后的工业基础，曾给我国社会主义建设事业造成很多困难，最主要的是不能利用原有的工业供应大规模建设所需要各种产品。为了战胜这个困难，几年来在苏联及人民民主国家的技术援助下，我国试制和生产了数千种新产品，其中绝大部分产品都是由无到有、由制造个别部件到制造成套机器、由几种产品发展到多种产品、由产品规格混乱到开始部分定型、由落后的技术标准向先进的技术标准发展。以各种机械设备为例，过去我国的制造能力很小，而现在我们自己能够供应的机械设备已占国民经济需要量百分之四十至六十。这说明我国的工业已开始走上独立制造的道路，开始为我国今后工业和农业的技术改造创立基础。
    扩大新产品的生产，进一步促进了工业生产的产销平衡，加强了各企业间的协作。产销平衡和企业间的协作是保证计划经济发展的一个重要条件。任何一个企业都必须在国家统一的计划下，根据国家的需要进行生产，依照计划取得别的企业给自己提供原料和设备条件，同时生产别的企业所需要的东西，这样才能保证生产的发展，在企业经营方面才能取得良好的经济效果。由于我国过去工业基础薄弱，技术水平低，在生产发展过程中出现了一种违反计划经济规律的情况：某些迫切需要的产品不能生产，需要量不大的或是不需要的产品却生产得很多。几年来增加新产品的结果，加强了我国工业和基本建设、钢铁工业和机械工业、轻工业和重工业、工业和农业生产之间的协作，初步满足了相互间的需要，产销趋向平衡，节省了外汇，加速了企业的资金周转，为国家积累了更多的资金。如上海机床厂在一九五三年生产旧规格产品的时候，全年销售量只占生产量的百分之六十五，一九五四年主要是生产新的品种，销售量占生产量百分之八十，一九五五年又增加了新的品种，产品就供不应求了。再从经济效果来看，上海机床厂一九五三年靠银行信贷过日子，全年付息近二十万元，一九五四年付出的利息只两万一千元，一九五五年不但不依靠贷款而且有盈余，预计为国家积累的资金比去年增加百分之二十。
    积极地增加新产品的制造，还可以大大地推动企业逐步进行技术改造，提高企业的生产技术水平，挖掘企业内部的潜力。为了增加新产品，供应国民经济的需要，想完全依靠原有的工业是不可能的，必须建立必要的新企业，增加大工业的比重，掌握新技术，调整各种产品的比例。但是，建设新的企业特别是重工业需要一定的时间，不可能马上投入生产，目前主要应该依靠我国原有的企业。我国原有的许多企业为了进行新产品的试制和生产，除了努力学习新的技术和推广先进经验以外，还进行了若干的改革和建设，如建立和健全产品的设计机构、改造或增建个别的车间、调整劳动组织、增添或调换某些设备、开展产品系列化和标准化的工作、制定新的工艺规程、采用新的技术标准和材料、利用新的工卡具和检验仪器、加强企业中的科学试验和研究工作。通过这些生产上技术上的改革和建设，不但保证完成了新产品试制和生产的计划，而且进一步提高了企业的技术水平，发挥了企业的潜在能力。目前我国各工业企业，为了试制和生产新产品，正对现有企业进行技术改造，为建立我国独立制造的工业奠定基础。
    因此，努力发展工业新产品的生产，充分供应国家建设所需要的产品，促进工业和农业的技术改造，这是一项具有严重的政治和经济意义的任务，也是考核每一个工业企业生产成就的一个重要的指标。
    但是，目前有许多保守思想阻碍了新产品的试制和生产。许多企业不能按时完成试制和生产新产品的计划；不少新产品的质量很差；有些迫切需要的产品还没有试制，而在试制成功的产品中又出现了新的积压现象。这些缺点的产生除了客观的困难以外，还有许多主观的原因。例如，至今某些工业部门还没有新产品的全面规划、没有把完成这一任务当成考核所属企业生产成就的重要指标、新产品试制机构和制度不健全，也很少对这一工作进行及时的检查和总结，对障碍开展这一工作的各种不正确思想的批判很差；同时，在不少企业的领导人员中，还不充分了解这个工作的重要意义，或者因为本位主义作怪，常常是被迫地接受任务，并且一再拖延，影响需用单位无法完成生产和建设计划；有的企业根本不按正规试制程序办事，草率进行试制，以致产品质量不高，达不到设计标准和使用单位的要求；还有的企业不注意经济效果，一有试制任务，就要求增加新车间、新设备，也不注意节省材料，使产品的成本过高。例如，大连钢厂一九五四年就没有完成新产品试制计划。这个厂今年试制新品种的任务相当重，由于前厂长袁执中同志对这一工作采取了消极态度，根本不了解今年的试制任务有多大、内容是什么，结果上半年动手试制的九种，只试制成功了一种。下半年，这个厂虽然有了转变，却失去了半年的时间。又如大连起重机器厂，没有很好组织试制工作，在一月至十月底试制的几十种产品中只有两种按时完成了，绝大部分都没有履行交货合同，被罚款二十万元。
    现在，我国农业合作化运动，正以空前未有的规模发展着，需要工业迅速给它提供技术改造的条件，并且促使工业也要迅速地前进。而社会主义工业化的日益发展，对新产品数量的需要必然会大大增加。因此，各工业部门必须大力进行试制和生产新产品的工作，应该积极利用苏联和各兄弟国家给我们的技术援助，迅速扩大新产品的数量，提高新产品的质量。这样才能加快我国社会主义的建设速度，为今后更大规模的工业建设创造有利的条件。一九五五年就要过去了，各工业主管部门应该立即对过去这一工作进行检查和总结，在制定一九五六年生产计划的时候，拟订出增加新产品的全面计划，建立和健全新产品的试制管理机构和制度，指导所属各企业采取最有效的措施，加强各个工业部门的协作，努力在新的年度中拿出更多更好的新产品来。
