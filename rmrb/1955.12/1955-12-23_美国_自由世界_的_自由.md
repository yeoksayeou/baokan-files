    American politicians and propaganda machines always like to describe the capitalist world as some kind of "free world." However, some people in the West have found that in the United States, the scope of this "free world" is pitifully small: only fifty-six streets wide from north to south, and only ten streets wide from east to west.

    This was revealed by the Associated Press. A recent AP dispatch from the United Nations in New York said that the U.S. government has restricted the movement of eighty-three foreign representatives, observers, and journalists stationed at the United Nations. Among them, seventy-three are Soviet representatives who came to participate in UN meetings and work, and five are Soviet journalists. This is already heinous enough. However, there are another four who are from countries in the so-called "free world" with the United States: two British observers who came to attend a meeting of a humanitarian organization, and two "foreign" official observers.

    The two British observers found that they could only stay at the United Nations headquarters in New York. "Without special permission, they may not go north more than forty streets beyond 97th Street," "westward they can go ten streets to Ninth Avenue, and southward they can go sixteen streets to 26th Street." And "the eastern boundary is the East River next to the United Nations headquarters." For them, this is the boundary of the American "free world." As for the other two "foreign" official observers, they "must obtain permission to go outside the city limits of New York."

    The reason why these people from Western countries are subject to restrictions on their movements in the United States is because they are unwilling or have not had time to hand over their freedom to the American authorities. The Associated Press said that the two observers from the United Kingdom are Mrs. Jessie Street, representing the Anti-Slavery Society, and the Anglican priest Michael Scott, representing the International League for the Rights of Man in Geneva. The American authorities asked Mrs. Street to list the names and details of the organizations she had participated in over the past twenty-five years since 1930, and asked Scott to explain his activities in South Africa against the apartheid policies of the Union of South Africa, and the situation of some people he associated with there. But Mrs. Street and Scott both refused to answer. The other two foreigners were too rushed when they came to attend the UN General Assembly and "did not wait to undergo security checks." Therefore, the American authorities gave them a "drawing a line as a prison", ordering them not to cross the prescribed range.

    When Dulles discussed the issue of East-West contact at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, he talked a lot about the "freedom of personnel exchanges and mutual travel" between East and West, but when the "freedom" of personnel from Western countries to travel in the United States is still like this, these lofty talks about East-West contact seem very disgusting.

### 美国“自由世界”的“自由”

    美国“自由世界”的“自由”
    美国的政客和宣传机器总喜欢把资本主义世界说成是什么“自由世界”。但是西方的某些人发现，在美国，这个“自由世界”的范围却小得可怜：南北只有五十六条街的宽度，而东西的宽度只有十条街。
    这是美联社透露的。美联社最近从纽约联合国发出的一条电讯说，美国政府限制了八十三名外国派驻联合国的代表、观察员和记者们的行动范围。其中有七十三位是前来参加联合国的会议和工作的苏联代表和五名苏联记者，这已经是够穷凶极恶的了。可是，还有另外的四位却是和美国同在所谓“自由世界”的人，两位是前来出席人道主义组织会议的英国观察员，两位“外国”的官方观察员。
    两位英国观察员发现他们只能呆在纽约联合国总部。他们“非经特别许可，不得向北走四十条街道而超过第九十七号街”，“往西可以走十条街到第九号路，往南可以走十六条街到第二十六号街。”而“东面的界限是联合国总部旁边的东江”。对于他们来说，这就是美国“自由世界”的四至边界了。至于另外两名“外国”的官方的观察员，他们“要前往纽约城界以外的地方去必须获得许可。”
    这几位西方国家的人所以在美国受到行动限制，是因为他们不肯或者是没有来得及向美国当局交呈他们的自由。美联社说，来自英国的两位观察员，一位是代表反奴隶制协会的杰西·斯崔特夫人，一位是代表日内瓦国际人权同盟的圣公会牧师迈克尔·斯科特。美国当局要斯崔特夫人列举出她从一九三○年以来二十五年内曾经参加过的组织的名称和情况，要斯科特交代出他在南非反对南非联邦政府种族歧视政策的活动，和他在当地所交往的一些人士的情况。但是斯崔特夫人和斯科特都拒绝回答。另外两名外国人则因为前来参加联合国大会时仓促得“没有等候进行安全检查”。因此，美国当局就给他们来一个“划地为牢”，命令他们不得越过规定的范围一步。
    杜勒斯在四国外长会议讨论东西方接触问题的时候曾经大谈东西方“人员交流和相互旅行的自由”，但是在西方国家的人员在美国旅行的“自由”尚且如此的时候，这些关于东西方接触的高谈阔论就显得非常地令人恶心。
