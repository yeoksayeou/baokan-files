Mutual consultation and understanding among German workers is the most effective way to victoriously conduct the struggle against the Paris Agreement and for a unified, democratic Germany. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic sends delegations to visit West German workers and trade union members, and West German delegations also visit factories and mines in the German Democratic Republic. In the past year and a half, more than 70,000 West German workers and trade union members have visited the German Democratic Republic despite the threats and persecution from the German Trade Union Federation (West Germany) cadres. Following the Fourth Congress of the Free German Trade Union Federation and the Geneva Four-Power Summit, mutual visits by delegations have increased even more.

On the invitation of the Free German Trade Union Federation alone, 5,020 guests from West Germany and West Berlin attended the Leipzig Autumn Fair this year. West German friends focused on discussing two important issues in their conversations with our workers: "How can we achieve German reunification?" and "What should the new Germany be like?" These two questions are frequently raised repeatedly.

A West German worker said very pertinently: "As long as the former revanchists and militarists control the Bonn state's regime, Germany's democracy and unification are impossible."

The new Germany must be a Germany that cannot be controlled by monopoly capitalist giants, fascists, and militarists. West German workers are not blind; they see the Bonn government and administrative organs, as well as public facilities, filled with formerly active fascists and officers of the Hitler Wehrmacht.

We will never allow anyone to infringe upon the achievements of the German Democratic Republic. On the contrary, workers and peasants are always ready to defend these achievements with all their strength. This is also in the interest of the West German working class. It is impossible and will not happen to establish the unification of our motherland by sacrificing the achievements of the German Democratic Republic.

Many West German workers, who live and work in poor social welfare and health conditions, also hope that West Germany will have achievements like those of the German Democratic Republic. It is incorrect to think that the achievements of the German Democratic Republic can be automatically transferred to West Germany when reunification is restored. The solution to this problem can only be achieved after a unified Germany is built, and after the people establish their own government without representatives of monopoly capital, fascists, and militarists. Only in this way can the people decide for themselves what the new Germany should be like; and only then can the people work hard according to their own plans to build their own country.

The situation in the former Soviet occupation zone is like this. The workers and working peasants there demanded the confiscation of the property of Konzerns and war criminals and the implementation of land reform. Their wishes were realized.

What the new Germany should be like can only and will only be decided by the German people, first and foremost by the working class and working peasants. Therefore, it is of great significance for workers and trade union members to further achieve understanding and consensus on these vital issues of our nation. We agree with the workers of the Opel car factory in Rüsselsheim, West Germany, who believe that: "...workers from both parts of Germany should sit down at a table and consult on the road to achieving unification."

The enthusiasm of the discussion about the impoverishment of West German workers that unfolded during the Leipzig Autumn Fair was unprecedented. A worker from West Germany said: "In West Germany, the 'happiness' of workers lies only in extra labor, overtime, and wives also participating in work. The 48-hour work week no longer exists. We must fight for normal working hours. It is completely contradictory to say 40 hours a week but actually work 60 or 70 hours."

A female worker from a metallurgical factory in Nuremberg said that she works 54 hours a week. She is a die-casting worker and performs heavy physical labor. During work, she has to move a 32-pound iron block 2,000 times a day. Every 32 minutes, 100 pieces have to be pressed out according to the model. Despite this, her wages cannot maintain the minimum living standard for her and her four children. This female worker indignantly talked about how her piece-rate wages were 69 pfennigs (German fractional currency, 100 pfennigs equal one mark) less than male workers doing the same work.

The situation of agricultural laborers is even worse. An agricultural worker from North Rhine-Westphalia talked about this. He said at the Third All-German Workers' Representative Conference: "It is very common today for women to earn 64 pfennigs per hour. Some companies also recruit 50, 60, or 70 children in the spring and autumn to pull beets, dig beets, and potatoes."

Agricultural laborers have to work 12, 14, or even 16 hours a day without any overtime pay. Examples like this are simply countless.

Our West German friends also discussed issues such as the nature and role of the worker-peasant state as opposed to the Bonn state, or how to establish unity of action among the working class.

The resolution unanimously adopted by the Third All-German Workers' Representative Conference in early September stipulated the path for future consultations. First and foremost, it is necessary to strengthen the mutual visits of workers and trade union members from both parts of Germany organized by the workers themselves. West German workers and trade union members should study the political, national, economic, and social problems of the German Democratic Republic in factories and enterprises, participate in worker and trade union meetings, and exchange opinions on solving the vital issues of the German nation in frank discussions.

The Free German Trade Union Federation believes that West German workers must also create further conditions themselves to ensure that delegations from the German Democratic Republic can participate in West German worker and trade union meetings. This has already been achieved in many places. There is no doubt that such an all-German consultation will lead to new victories in the struggle to win unity of action of the German working class.

### 德国工人的互相协商是促进德国统一的有效办法

    德国工人的互相协商是促进德国统一的有效办法
    自由德国工会联合会全国执行委员会委员海茵茨·布吕尔
    德国工人的协商谅解是胜利地进行反对巴黎协定和争取统一、民主的德国的斗争的最有效办法。因此，德意志民主共和国派遣代表团访问西德工人和工会会员，西德的代表团也访问德意志民主共和国的工矿企业。在过去一年半中，有七万多名西德工人和工会会员不顾德国工会联合会（西德）干部的威吓和迫害，访问了德意志民主共和国。在自由德国工会联合会第四届代表大会和日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以后，代表团的相互访问更多了。
    单是应自由德国工会联合会的邀请，参加今年来比锡秋季博览会的西德和西柏林来宾就有五千零二十人。西德朋友在同我们工人的谈话中着重讨论了两个重要问题：“我们怎样才能求得德国的统一？”和“新德国应当是什么样子的？”这两个问题是经常有人一再提出的。
    有一个西德工人说得很中肯：“只要从前的复仇主义分子和军国主义分子掌握波恩国家的政权，德国的民主、统一就是不可能的。”
    新德国必须是一个不能由垄断资本巨头、法西斯分子和军国主义分子掌权的德国。西德工人并不是瞎子，他们看到波恩的政府和行政机关以及公共设施内部充塞着从前积极活动的法西斯分子和希特勒国防军军官。
    我们决不会允许任何人侵犯德意志民主共和国的成果。相反地，工人和农民时刻准备用一切力量来保卫这些成果。这也是符合西德工人阶级的利益的。用牺牲德意志民主共和国成就的办法来建立我们祖国的统一是不可能并且也是不会有的。
    在恶劣的社会福利和卫生条件下生活和工作的许多西德工人，也希望西德有德意志民主共和国那样的成就。如果认为在恢复统一时就可以自动地把德意志民主共和国的成果搬到西德去，那是不正确的。这个问题的解决只能在统一的德国建成以后，在人民建立了没有垄断资本代表、没有法西斯分子和军国主义分子的自己的政府以后。只有这样，人民才能够自己决定新德国应该是什么样子的；人民也才能够按照自己的计划努力劳动以建设自己的国家。
    前苏占区的情形就是这样的。那里的工人和劳动农民要求没收康采恩和战犯的财产和实行土地改革。他们的愿望得到了实现。
    新德国应该是什么样子的，只能并且只会由德国人民、首先是由工人阶级和劳动农民来决定。因此，工人和工会会员就我们民族的这些切身问题进一步取得谅解和一致的意见，是具有重要意义的。我们和西德吕赛尔斯海姆的奥佩尔汽车厂工人的意见一样，他们认为：“……德国两部分的工人应当坐到一张桌子旁边来，就达到统一的道路进行协商。”
    在来比锡秋季博览会举行时展开的对西德工人贫困化的讨论的热烈情况是从来没有过的。一个从西德来的工人说：“在西德，工人的‘幸福’只是在于额外劳动、加班加点和妻子也参加工作。每周工作四十八小时已经不存在了。我们必须进行斗争，争取正常的工作时间。嘴上说的是每周工作四十小时而实际上却要工作六、七十小时，这是完全矛盾的。”
    纽伦堡某冶金工厂的一个女工说，她每周要工作五十四小时。她是压模工人，进行沉重的体力劳动。她在工作时每天必须把一块重三十二磅的铁块移动两千次。每三十二分钟要按照模型压出一百件。虽然如此，她的工资还无法维持她和她的四个孩子的最低生活水平。这个女工愤慨地谈到她的包件工资比做同样工作的男工要少六十九个芬尼（德国的辅币，每一百个芬尼等于一个马克）。
    农业雇工的情况更坏了。北莱茵威斯特伐里亚的一个农业工人谈到了这点。他在第三届全德工人代表会议上说：“妇女每小时的工资是六十四个芬尼，今天已是很普遍的了。也有些企业在春天和秋天招雇五十、六十和七十个儿童来拔甜菜、掘甜菜和马铃薯。”
    农业雇工每天要工作十二、十四或者甚至十六个小时而没有任何加班费。像这种例子简直是不胜枚举。
    我们的西德朋友们还讨论了像同波恩国家相反的工农国家的性质和作用或怎样才能建立工人阶级行动一致等问题。
    今年九月初，第三届全德工人代表会议一致通过的决议规定了今后协商的道路。首要的是，必须加强由工人自己来组织德国两部分工人和工会会员的相互访问。西德工人和工会会员应当在工厂企业中研究德意志民主共和国的政治、民族、经济和社会问题，参加工人和工会的会议，并在坦率的讨论中对解决德意志民族切身问题交换意见。
    自由德国工会联合会认为西德工人自己也必须创造进一步的条件，保证从德意志民主共和国去的代表团能够参加西德工人和工会的会议。许多地方已经做到了这一点。毫无疑问，像这样一种全德协商一定会使争取德国工人阶级行动一致的斗争获得新的胜利。
