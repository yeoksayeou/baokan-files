    Each Woman Accumulates a Cart of Fertilizer
    Li Suyun, Yang Xiuying, and other seven female members of the Damanhe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jixian County, Hebei Province, recently launched a "Accumulate a Cart of Fertilizer" campaign among all the female cooperative members.
    The 86 women in the cooperative decided to adopt methods such as diligently bedding the pigsty, sweeping streets and courtyards, burning fertilizer, collecting plant ash, digging up kang soil, picking up manure, and excavating toilets to collect various kinds of fertilizer. They plan to accumulate 258 carts of fertilizer (about 2,000 jin per cart) in 60 days. With this fertilizer, the cooperative's difficulty in lacking fertilizer for next year's production can be greatly alleviated.
    This fact from the Damanhe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative shows that the potential for accumulating fertilizer in rural areas is multifaceted. Mobilizing female labor to regularly and continuously collect fertilizer scattered in various corners is one of the effective ways to solve the cooperative's fertilizer shortage problem.

    每个妇女积一车肥
    河北省蓟县大漫河乡农业生产合作社的女社员李素云、杨秀英等七人，最近向全社妇女社员发起了“积一车肥”运动。
    这个社的八十六个妇女决定采取勤垫猪圈、扫街扫院、烧肥、收集草木灰、挖炕土、拾粪、挖厕所等办法，收集各种各样的肥料，计划在六十天中积肥二百五十八车（每车肥约两千斤）。有了这些肥料，就可以在很大程度上解决合作社明年生产上缺少肥料的困难。
    大漫河乡农业生产合作社的这个事实说明，农村积肥的潜力是多方面的；发动妇女劳动力经常不断地收集散在各个角落的肥料，就是解决合作社缺肥问题的有效办法之一。
