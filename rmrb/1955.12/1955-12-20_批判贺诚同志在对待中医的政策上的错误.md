Criticizing Comrade He Cheng's Errors in Policy Towards Traditional Chinese Medicine
Ren Xiaofeng

I

Comrade He Cheng's errors in policy towards Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are serious. Comrade He Cheng published his self-criticism in the People's Daily on November 19th; however, the self-criticism was not deep enough. It is the responsibility of us medical workers to continue to criticize his erroneous thoughts, eliminate the negative influence of his erroneous thoughts in the health departments, and better implement the Party's policy towards TCM.

Comrade He Cheng's attitude towards TCM and our national medical heritage differs in principle from the views of our Party. This difference is the difference between bourgeois idealism and the Party's theoretical foundation—dialectical materialism. The Party has always believed that TCM is an excellent national cultural heritage of our country. It has made significant contributions to the survival and development of our nation in history. Today, it is still the main force for the vast number of people in our country to overcome diseases and maintain health. Correctly uniting the forces of TCM and developing the theory and experience of TCM is one of the important keys to further developing our country's medical science and improving the health of our people. The Party has always attached importance to the forces of TCM, adhered to the policy of uniting TCM, and regarded all behaviors that despise and discriminate against TCM as incompatible with the fundamental interests of our people. However, the Chinese comprador bourgeoisie prostrated themselves and blindly worshipped European and American capitalist culture, and tried their best to denigrate our national cultural heritage, devaluing TCM to nothing. In 1929, the Kuomintang reactionary government openly passed the "Abolish TCM Act," adopting a policy of complete elimination of TCM. Although this reactionary policy failed to be realized due to the opposition of the people across the country, the bourgeois slavish thought that was hostile to our national medical heritage spread widely and was deeply poisonous. Even after the national liberation, it still had a certain influence in our country's health departments. Comrade He Cheng is one of the representatives of this kind of thought.

Comrade He Cheng has long resisted the Party's policy of uniting TCM with the bourgeois idea of eliminating TCM. He even went so far as to distort the facts and describe Yu Yunxiu, a notorious bourgeois scholar who had been actively engaged in the elimination of TCM for more than 30 years, as a contributor to TCM. At the first National Health Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Health in 1950, Comrade He Cheng "specially invited" Yu Yunxiu to attend the meeting as a "representative of TCM," and said: "In the past, Mr. Yu Yunxiu had criticized TCM, and many of them were correct... The basic spirit is still good... I think, in order to show the progress of the TCM representatives, understand Chairman Mao's spirit of great unity between Chinese and Western medicine, as well as the great mind and spirit of our great nation, we should welcome Mr. Yu to participate in the TCM group and ask him to make more criticisms and opinions on the reform of TCM, which will be beneficial to TCM." Is Yu Yunxiu a contributor or a sinner of TCM? People are fully aware of this. As early as 1929, Yu Yunxiu submitted a proposal to the Kuomintang reactionary government to "abolish TCM" and it was approved, leaving a shameful page in the history of medicine in our country. In 1950, Yu Yunxiu's "Proposal on Handling Old Doctors" submitted to the Central Ministry of Health again referred to TCM as "mythology," "astrology," and "must be completely eradicated." As late as 1952, he publicly clamored that the long history of TCM "is a dark history, not a bright history; a history of shame, not a glorious history." Obviously, it is absurd to say that Yu Yunxiu is "beneficial" to TCM. Comrade He Cheng's praise for Yu Yunxiu gave great encouragement to the bourgeois thought that despised TCM. This is an undeniable fact. In the years after liberation, Yu Yunxiu and others intensified their activities, openly published books that slandered TCM, and printed and distributed plans to eliminate TCM, without any intervention from the health department. Therefore, Yu Yunxiu and his like said gleefully: "It can be seen that our consistent advocacy and the direction we have taken have always been correct. Therefore, the medical revolution (note: that is, the elimination of TCM) will definitely achieve the final victory at the present stage, which is beyond doubt; the medical revolution of the past forty years should be a stage of transition from theory to practice from now on." It is very obvious to whom Comrade He Cheng's thoughts are beneficial and who supports him.

II

Comrade He Cheng's main arguments for negating TCM are as follows:

First, TCM is "backward," "unscientific," and "lacks the foundation of modern natural science," so it is fundamentally undesirable. In fact, this argument itself lacks the most basic scientific flavor.

From the Marxist-Leninist point of view, medicine, like other natural sciences, is the product of human labor. In order to produce and live, mankind began a fierce struggle with diseases from the beginning of human history. Understanding stems from practice. With the continuous accumulation of experience in the struggle, mankind will inevitably recognize the phenomena, nature, and internal connections of diseases from shallow to deep and from one-sided to more aspects, and obtain the knowledge of the laws of preventing and treating diseases, that is, medical knowledge. Our country is vast and rich in resources, densely populated, and has a long history. It is entirely understandable that the medical heritage left to us by our ancestors is extremely rich and valuable. TCM is a unique and systematic medical system created by the people of our country in long-term labor that is suitable for the characteristics of our nation. TCM has good curative effects on many diseases. This is a fact. This is a true and undeniable fact that has been proven countless times by the practice of hundreds of millions of people for thousands of years. Therefore, we cannot but admit that TCM has great scientific value. Stalin said: "The principles of science have always been tested by practice and experience. If science is cut off from practice and experience, what kind of science is it?" Lenin said: "To be a materialist is to acknowledge the objective truth revealed by our sensory organs." However, Comrade He Cheng does not recognize the facts, does not recognize the infinitely rich objective truth revealed to us by the sensory organs of hundreds of millions of people for thousands of years, but talks about science and accuses TCM of being "unscientific." This proves that Comrade He Cheng lacks the most basic scientific attitude.

It is a fact that TCM lacks the foundation of modern natural science. This is the main reason why the rich experience and theory of TCM cannot be further developed and promoted. However, we have no reason to ask our ancestors living in ancient society to prepare for us a medicine with a modern natural science foundation; nor is it possible to demand that TCM can have great development under the reactionary rule of old China in the past 100 years; but there are sufficient reasons and possibilities to require the health departments after the founding of New China to faithfully implement the Party's policy of uniting TCM, undertake the glorious task of inheriting and developing TCM, and gradually make TCM obtain the foundation of modern natural science. However, it is precisely today that Comrade He Cheng refuses to implement the Party's policy of uniting TCM and refuses to use the weapons of modern natural science to develop the rich treasures of TCM, so that TCM still cannot get the due development. Is this the fault of the ancients, or is it the fault of Comrade He Cheng?

From the above analysis, denying facts, negating science, and hindering the development of science is the true meaning of the word "science" flaunted by Comrade He Cheng.

Second, TCM is "outdated" and "unsuitable" for today's needs. Comrade He Cheng said: "TCM is a product of the feudal era." He said: "Certain people and certain technologies are only suitable for certain eras... As society advances, new things will inevitably be produced to replace all old things. However, the historical role of all old things should still be recognized." This naturally means that TCM, which was produced in the feudal era, is only suitable for the needs of the feudal era. When the feudal system is eliminated, TCM will lose its role and can no longer cure diseases. Has TCM really lost its ability to cure diseases due to social progress and changes in the times? Any sensible Chinese person can immediately cite true examples to prove that Comrade He Cheng is distorting objective facts. This fallacy of regarding medicine as the superstructure of society cannot stand at all, either in theory or in fact.

Medicine is a natural science. It is not the product of a certain era or a certain class, but the accumulation and development of experience of mankind fighting against diseases since the beginning of history. It is the same for all ages. It is suitable for the feudal era, suitable for the capitalist era, and also suitable for the socialist era. It is not the superstructure, nor does it disappear with the elimination of a certain foundation and a certain class. TCM could cure diseases thousands of years ago, and it can still cure diseases today. Who can overthrow this fact? With the advancement of the times and the changes of society, science has gained further development because it has broken away from the shackles of the old foundation and superstructure. This is undeniable. The elimination of the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal foundation and superstructure in our country and the rapid growth of the new socialist foundation and superstructure have opened up an extremely broad road for the development of science in our country. The glorious task of medical scientists is to advance rapidly along this broad road of development in order to create higher-level medical science than in the past to serve the great socialist construction of our country. However, these new and higher-level medical achievements cannot fall from the sky, but must be developed on the basis of inheriting historical heritage. Without critically absorbing and further developing all the positive and valuable things in the medical heritage of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, new and higher-level medicine will not be produced at all. As Lenin taught us: "Proletarian culture should be the inevitable result of the development of the knowledge collection created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist society, landlord society, and bureaucratic society." Abandoning the scientific heritage is destroying science. Comrade He Cheng's view of obliterating the medical heritage of the motherland is the "cave dweller" view that Stalin has strictly criticized, and it is a thorough anti-scientific and anti-Marxist-Leninist view.

According to Comrade He Cheng's "theory," Western medicine is of course completely undesirable. Since "certain technologies are only suitable for certain eras," how can Western medicine from the capitalist era of Europe and the United States be suitable for the needs of the people of our country? It can be seen that Comrade He Cheng's "theory" does not reflect objective reality at all, but is only fabricated to negate TCM.

Western medicine is based on modern natural science and is more advanced than TCM. This is undeniable. Therefore, the Party has always attached importance to Western medicine. However, Western medicine does not include all the world's medical knowledge, and TCM can still cure many diseases that cannot be cured by Western medicine. This is also undeniable. Once TCM is combined with modern natural science, it will surely shine brightly and make brilliant contributions to modern world medicine. This is completely certain. However, Comrade He Cheng neither recognizes the medical achievements of the Chinese people in the past nor believes that the Chinese people can have any medical creations in the future, and insists on "replacing TCM with Western medicine." This is the starting point of Comrade He Cheng's entire "theory" of negating TCM.

III

For several years, Comrade He Cheng has been guiding TCM work with his erroneous "theory," and as a result, a series of errors have occurred in TCM policy.

First, restricting TCM business. Comrade He Cheng said when calculating the strength of the national health work: "According to the Chinese population, if one doctor is equipped for every thousand people, there will be 450,000 doctors. Now there are only about 40,000 doctors, which is far behind." In Comrade He Cheng's view, not even one Western doctor is as good as the 500,000 TCM doctors in our country. Therefore, he said: The source of medical personnel in rural grassroots health organizations "relies on the training of schools on the one hand, and... on the transfer from medical personnel in large cities on the other hand." Urban hospitals and clinics cannot allow TCM doctors to participate, because "even if the government places TCM doctors to work in hospitals and clinics, they will still be eliminated if they do not progress themselves." Comrade He Cheng has no intention of absorbing TCM doctors to work in national health institutions at all.

Regarding private TCM practitioners, the "Interim Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations on the Management of TCM Clinics" of the Central Ministry of Health stipulates that TCM clinics should be responsible for infectious disease prevention and control work, health publicity work, environmental health work, epidemic reporting and other relevant public health work. However, the issue of the political and economic treatment of TCM doctors is not mentioned at all. Many TCM doctors participate in labor without compensation for as long as 40 to 50 days to 60 to 70 days a year, which seriously affects the lives of TCM doctors, so that some TCM doctors are forced to "wash their hands" and change careers.

Comrade He Cheng has long ignored the issue of Chinese medicine, which is relied upon by 80% of the people in our country to treat diseases. There are more than 2,000 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, and there are as many as 300 to 400 kinds of commonly used medicines. However, the "Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China" published by the Central Ministry of Health in 1953 contains very few crude drugs, and adopts an attitude of non-recognition towards most Chinese medicines.

TCM plays an extremely important role in medical treatment, prevention, health and epidemic prevention, and the patriotic health movement. This is an obvious fact. There are not too many medical personnel in our country, but too few. Therefore, expanding the TCM business by one point will benefit the people's health by one point, and benefit socialist construction by one point. This is an obvious truth. Developing TCM business, expanding the TCM team, and making it serve the people is the fundamental purpose of the Party's policy of uniting TCM. However, Comrade He Cheng insisted on using various methods to restrict the TCM business, reduce the TCM team, and reduce the opportunities for TCM to serve the people, which increased the difficulty for the people to see a doctor and use medicine. What other reasons can be given for this behavior other than the despicable bourgeois sectarianism?

Second, TCM qualification review. The measures for TCM qualification review are to review TCM doctors across the country according to the so-called TCM "qualifications" made by Comrade He Cheng, issue doctor's certificates to qualified doctors, and revoke the doctor's qualifications of unqualified doctors. Rural TCM doctors account for about 80% of the total number of TCM doctors in the country. The results of the review of rural TCM doctors, taking 68 counties in North China directly led by the Central Ministry of Health as an example, show that more than 90% of TCM doctors were considered "unqualified."

Comrade He Cheng once said: TCM doctors "cannot be soldiers and have few opportunities to be workers, so the future development is mainly for farmers." According to Comrade He Cheng's original plan, the method of "first TCM, then cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, and finally Western medicine replacing TCM" was to be implemented in rural areas. According to this plan, the existence time of rural TCM doctors should be the longest. Because it is by no means possible to train hundreds of thousands of Western doctors to replace TCM doctors in ten or twenty years. However, Comrade He Cheng used the method of TCM qualification review to "wipe out" rural TCM doctors. The seriousness of the problem is really hard to imagine!

One of the important methods of TCM qualification review is TCM examination. In Tianjin, the number of TCM doctors who passed the examination was less than 10% of the TCM doctors who took the examination. If a universal examination is conducted, it is not difficult to imagine how many "qualified" TCM doctors there will be in the country.

Now let us take a look at the content of Comrade He Cheng's review and examination of TCM doctors.

The so-called "qualifications" for reviewing TCM doctors include six items: 1. Holders of TCM medical school graduation certificates of four years or more; 2. Those who have passed the examination by the Central or Greater Region Ministry of Health; 3. Those who have been issued TCM physician certificates or examination pass certificates by the health authorities of the provincial or municipal people's government; 4. Those who originally held TCM physician certificates or examination pass certificates from the Central Government of the Kuomintang (or the puppet Manchukuo); 5. Graduates of TCM refresher schools; 6. Holders of temporary TCM certificates who have worked for two years without any fault. However, apart from the fourth item, which has some practical content, the other items can be said to be basically empty. Because before the Central Ministry of Health reviewed TCM doctors, the health authorities above the provincial and municipal levels in the country generally neither reviewed nor examined TCM doctors, nor approved any "temporary" TCM doctors; after the work of reviewing TCM doctors across the country began, there were fewer than 1,000 graduates from TCM refresher schools; before liberation, graduates of TCM schools were not only very few in number, but were almost completely included in the number of qualified TCM doctors approved by the Kuomintang and puppet Manchukuo governments. However, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Health, the Kuomintang and puppet Manchukuo governments issued a total of no more than 50,000 certificates to TCM doctors in the past few decades. Even if these TCM doctors are still alive and continue to practice TCM, they account for only 10% of the total number of TCM doctors in our country. Using such so-called qualification standards to review TCM doctors, the result is that the vast majority of TCM doctors will be eliminated. Isn't this what Comrade He Cheng expected? Moreover, we don't know what reason Comrade He Cheng has to believe in the correctness of the Kuomintang and puppet Manchukuo governments' review of TCM doctors and unconditionally recognize it in its entirety.

The content of the compulsory subjects for examining TCM doctors includes four kinds, of which there is only one TCM subject, and Western medicine subjects account for the majority. It can be seen from this that all TCM doctors who pass the examination are mainly not because they have rich TCM knowledge (even if they have it, they can't use it), but because they understand some Western medicine. Comrade He Cheng's examination is actually not for selecting TCM doctors, but attempting to select a group of Western doctors from TCM doctors. Isn't this very clear? Using Western medicine subjects to examine TCM doctors, the meanness of the intention has really reached an unspeakable degree.

If it is not for the purpose of eliminating TCM doctors, but for the purpose of better uniting, educating, and using TCM doctors, it is possible and necessary to take review, examination, and other methods appropriately for different objects to conduct an assessment of the technology and experience of TCM doctors. However, when conducting this assessment, we should also rely on the masses and listen to the voices of the masses. Whether the diagnosis is correct and whether the treatment is effective are the most specific and realistic issues for people who are sick and take medicine. After taking the medicine, it is effective or ineffective, and there is no room for falsehood. Therefore, as long as it can really cure the people, even if it only has a special skill, and can cure a certain disease for the people, and is confirmed by practice and trusted by the people, it has sufficient TCM qualifications. The TCM doctor who is truly trusted by the people cannot be eliminated by anyone. Comrade He Cheng neither believes in the masses nor recognizes the facts, and concocts a set of so-called TCM "qualifications" out of thin air as the standard for selecting TCM doctors. This is utter idealism and a manifestation of extremely despicable and bad bourgeois psychology.

Third, TCM refresher courses. The only way out Comrade He Cheng pointed out for TCM doctors is to take refresher courses. Comrade He Cheng said: "The so-called refresher courses are to learn the basic knowledge of modern scientific medicine... to use the basic knowledge of science and medicine to explain problems, instead of the idealistic method." He said: "If TCM schools are also run to teach TCM theories and diagnostic methods, it is uneconomical. After learning TCM, it will be uneconomical to take refresher courses in the future." "If refresher schools are run and TCM theory is still taught, it is not beneficial to the future of TCM." "If you say that this is the Westernization of TCM, I think it is good." In short, abandoning TCM and learning Western medicine is the only way out for TCM doctors. In Changchun, 43% of the TCM doctors who have taken refresher courses have become Western doctors. This is the "harvest" of Comrade He Cheng's TCM refresher courses. Since TCM schools are not allowed to be run to learn TCM, and medical colleges are not allowed to teach TCM courses, and the only TCM refresher schools are only allowed to learn Western medicine and not TCM, the final result is very clear.

TCM refresher courses are completely necessary. In the process of refresher courses, it is completely right to let TCM doctors learn some basic knowledge of Western medicine. However, as the main course of the refresher schools, which is the only "formal school nature" for TCM doctors, it should be about TCM in any case. The reason is very simple, because TCM is very useful, and because the members of the refresher courses are TCM doctors and not Western doctors. The so-called "scientification" of TCM is to use modern scientific theories and methods to conduct systematic research and sorting out of TCM's theories and experiences, to extract its essence and remove its dross, and to excavate and carry forward everything with scientific value in it, enrich it into the treasure house of modern medicine. Therefore, the "scientification" of TCM is by no means a task that can be undertaken by a short one-year TCM refresher school. This requires close cooperation between TCM and Western medicine to conduct long-term study and research, especially requiring Western medicine to learn TCM and specialized research institutions to do this work. Comrade He Cheng does not attach importance to TCM research at all, but mistakenly emphasizes TCM doctors learning Western medicine, and praises it as "scientification." This is just borrowing the name of TCM "scientification" to carry out the reality of TCM "Westernization."

From the above points, we can only draw the conclusion that Comrade He Cheng's policy towards TCM is a policy of utilizing, restricting, and eliminating TCM, which is diametrically opposed to the Party's policy of uniting TCM and has nothing in common. It should be pointed out that, thanks to the Party's timely prevention and the firm opposition of the people across the country, Comrade He Cheng's "policy" has not been realized; but even so, it has hindered the correct implementation of the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, and has brought incalculable losses to the health cause of our people.

IV

More seriously, Comrade He Cheng's mistakes have been criticized and educated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong many times, ordering him to earnestly correct them; however, he has stubbornly adhered to his own opinions for a long time, insisted on his mistakes, and refused the Party's leadership over him. His reason is that health work is a "special" scientific and technological work, and the Party Central Committee "does not understand science and technology," so it cannot lead health work. This absurd idea of negating the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work is the peak of the development of Comrade He Cheng's bourgeois ideology, the root cause of all his mistakes, and the most fundamental error among all his errors.

Science and technology are the weapons we rely on to build socialism. All scientific and technological departments must strictly follow the line, policies, and construction plans formulated by the Party based on Marxist-Leninist principles to carry out their work, regard the work of their departments as a fighting component of socialist construction, and advance under unified command in order to effectively serve socialism and become truly useful construction tools. Otherwise, deviating from the Party's line and doing whatever one wants will inevitably lose direction and bring serious harm to the construction cause. The Party pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate the main forces to develop socialist industry, but Comrade He Cheng insisted on ignoring industrial health work for a long time; the Party pointed out that it is necessary to unite and give play to the forces of TCM to serve the people, but Comrade He Cheng insisted on restricting and eliminating TCM, so that useful science and technology could not be used correctly. Is this not enough to illustrate the danger of science and technology leaving the Party's leadership?

Scientific and technological work has its particularities, but the only science that can correctly reflect the general laws of science is the Party's theoretical foundation—dialectical materialism. Therefore, any scientific work that cannot be firmly established on the basis of militant Marxism-Leninism cannot resist the attack of bourgeois ideas, and therefore cannot be truly developed. That is to say, only the Party that is proficient in Marxism-Leninism can most perfectly lead the development of science. And Comrade He Cheng's mistake of negating the national medical heritage is the inevitable result of violating the scientific principles of Marxism-Leninism. Moreover, our Party is a party that maintains close contact with the broad masses of the people, and there are thousands of scientific workers who are loyal to the cause of socialist construction united around the Party. This is where the Party's strength lies, and this is the Party's inexhaustible source of knowledge. The Party is able to fully concentrate the wisdom of the masses and is good at using the knowledge of scientific workers to lead scientific and technological work. The view that opposes the knowledge of the Party to the knowledge of the broad masses is completely contrary to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

If all scientific and technological workers want to make the science and technology they have mastered better serve the people, they should be determined to serve the people and determined to hand over all their achievements to the people. That is to say, to be a truly conscious and glorious people's scientific worker, one must seriously study Marxism-Leninism, study the Party's line and policies, in order to improve awareness, transform ideas, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life and world view. The reason why the health department has long had a thin political atmosphere and low work efficiency, and the strength of the broad medical staff has not been fully utilized, has a lot to do with Comrade He Cheng's disregard for politics, disregard for Marxism-Leninism, and disregard for the Party's leadership.

The serious lesson of Comrade He Cheng's mistakes is that all work, including scientific and technological work, must be strictly placed under the leadership of the Party in order to be correctly developed and become truly useful. Without correct political leadership, there is no correct business leadership at all. This is a truth.

Comrade He Cheng's mistakes have brought great losses to the people across the country, and have spread extremely bad ideological influences in the health department, becoming a major obstacle to the progress of health work. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize Comrade He Cheng's erroneous thoughts, and improve the ideological awareness of the broad health workers from this criticism, thoroughly correct the non-political tendencies in the health department, and make the people's health cause move forward in big strides.

    批判贺诚同志在对待中医的政策上的错误
    任小风
    一      
    贺诚同志在对待中医的政策上所犯的错误是严重的。十一月十九日贺诚同志在人民日报上发表了他的检讨文章；但检讨得不够深刻。继续批判他的错误思想，清除他的错误思想在卫生部门留下的不良影响，更好地贯彻执行党对待中医的政策，这是我们医务工作者的责任。
    贺诚同志在对待中医、对待我国民族医学遗产的态度上，和我们党的观点有着原则的分歧。这种分歧，是资产阶级唯心主义思想和党的理论基础——辩证唯物主义思想的分歧。党一贯认为中医是我国优秀的民族文化遗产，在历史上对于我国民族的生存和发展有过重大的贡献，在今天，依然还是我国广大人民赖以战胜疾病、维护健康的主要力量。正确地团结中医力量，发展中医的学理和经验，是进一步发展我国医学科学和改善我国人民健康状况的重要关键之一。党从来重视中医力量，坚持团结中医的政策，把一切轻视和歧视中医的行为看作是和我国人民的根本利益不相容的。但是中国买办资产阶级则奴颜婢膝，盲目崇拜欧美资本主义文化，竭力诋毁我国民族文化遗产，把中医贬得一钱不值。一九二九年，国民党反动政府就曾公然通过“废止中医案”，对中医采取了完全消灭的政策。这种反动的政策，虽然由于全国人民的反对而未能实现；但敌视我国民族医学遗产的资产阶级奴化思想，却传播很广，流毒很深，直到全国解放之后，还在我国卫生部门中有一定的影响。贺诚同志就是这种思想的代表之一。
    贺诚同志长期以资产阶级的消灭中医的思想来抗拒党的团结中医的政策，甚至不惜颠倒黑白，把积极从事消灭中医活动三十多年的臭名昭著的资产阶级学者余云岫说成是中医的功臣。在一九五○年中央卫生部召开第一届全国卫生会议的时候，贺诚同志“特邀”余云岫为“中医代表”出席会议，并且说：“过去余云岫先生曾批判过中医学术，有许多是对的……基本精神还是好的……我以为，为显得中医代表先生的进步，体会毛主席中西医大团结的精神，以及我们伟大民族的伟大胸怀和气魄，应当欢迎余先生来参加中医小组，并要求他作更多的批评与改革中医学术的意见，这对于中医来说，是有好处的。”余云岫究竟是中医的功臣、还是中医的罪人？人们是完全了解的。远在一九二九年，余云岫就曾向国民党反动政府提出“废止中医”的提案，并得到批准，在我国医学史上留下了可耻的一页。一九五○年余云岫向中央卫生部提出的“处理旧医的提案”中，又指中医为“神话”，“占星术”，“非完全革除不可”。直到一九五二年，他还公开叫嚣说中医的悠久历史“是黑暗的历史，不是光明的历史；是耻辱的历史，不是光荣的历史”。很显然，说余云岫对中医有“好处”，这是十分荒唐的。贺诚同志对于余云岫的备加赞扬，使鄙视中医的资产阶级思想受到莫大的鼓舞，这是不能隐讳的事实。解放后数年来，余云岫等变本加厉，大肆活动，公开出版诬蔑中医的书籍，印发消灭中医“方案”，未曾受到卫生部门的任何干涉。所以余云岫之流兴高采烈地说：“可见我们历来主张和所走的方向，始终是正确的，所以医学革命（按：即消灭中医）在现阶段一定能获得最后胜利，是绝无疑问的；四十年来的医学革命，从今以后，应该是由理论转向实践的阶段了。”贺诚同志的思想究竟对于什么人有利，为什么人所拥护，是十分明显的。
    二
    贺诚同志否定中医的主要论据有以下两点：
    第一、是中医“落后”，“不科学”，“缺乏近代自然科学基础”，因而根本要不得。其实，这种论据的本身，就缺乏起码的科学气味。
    从马克思列宁主义的观点看来，医学和其他各种自然科学一样，是人类劳动的产物。人类为要生产、生活，从人类历史揭幕之日起，就开始和疾病进行剧烈的斗争。认识导源于实践。随着斗争经验的不断积累，人类便必然由浅到深、由片面到更多方面地认识疾病的现象、性质和内部联系，获得预防和治疗疾病的规律知识，即医学知识。我国地大物博，人口众多，历史悠久，我们的祖先遗留给我们的医学遗产也极为丰富、可贵，这是完全可以理解的。中医就是我国人民从长期劳动中创造出来的，适合于自己民族特点的独特而系统的医学体系。中医对于许多疾病有良好的疗效，这是事实，这是早为数千年来亿万人民无数次的实践所证明了的千真万确的事实。因此，我们不能不承认中医具有极大的科学价值。斯大林说：“科学底原理向来都是由实践，由经验来考验的。如果科学和实践断绝了关系，和经验断绝了关系，那它还算是什么科学呢？”列宁说：“作一个唯物论者，就是说要承认我们的感觉器官所展示的客观真理。”然而贺诚同志却不承认事实，不承认数千年来亿万人民感觉器官所展示于我们的无限丰富的客观真理，而妄谈科学，妄加中医以“不科学”的罪名，足证贺诚同志缺乏起码的科学态度。
    中医缺乏近代自然科学基础，这是事实。这正是中医丰富的经验和学理得不到进一步发扬光大的主要原因。但是我们没有理由要求生存在古代社会的我们的祖先能为我们准备下具有近代自然科学基础的医学；也没有可能要求在近百年来旧中国反动统治之下，中医能有很大的发展；却有充分的理由和可能要求新中国成立之后的卫生部门，忠实地执行党的团结中医的政策，担当起继承和发展中医的光荣任务，逐步使中医获得近代自然科学的基础。然而，也正是在今天，贺诚同志却拒绝执行党的团结中医的政策，拒绝以近代自然科学的武器开拓中医的丰富宝藏，使中医至今仍然得不到应有的发展，这究竟是罪在古人，还是错在贺诚同志？
    从上面的分析看，否认事实，否定科学，阻碍科学发展，就是贺诚同志所标榜的“科学”二字的真实含义。
    第二、是中医“过时”了，已经“不适合”今天的需要了。贺诚同志说：“中医是封建时代的产物。”他说：“一定的人，一定的技术只适合于一定的时代……社会推进了，必然产生新的东西来代替旧的一切。但是，对于旧的一切还应承认它们在历史上的作用。”这自然是说，产生于封建时代的中医，只适合于封建时代的需要。封建制度消灭了，中医就随之而失去作用，不能再治病了。中医果然因社会推进，时代变迁，而不能再治病了吗？任何一个懂事的中国人，都可以立即举出千真万确的事例来证明，贺诚同志是在歪曲客观事实。这种把医学看作是社会的上层建筑的谬论，无论在理论上、事实上，都是根本站不住脚的。
    医学是一门自然科学，它不是某一时代和某一阶级的产物，而是人类从有史以来同疾病作斗争的经验的积累和发展。它对于各个时代，是一视同仁的。它适合于封建时代，适合于资本主义时代，也适合于社会主义时代。它不是上层建筑，也不随某一基础和某一阶级的消灭而消灭。中医在千百年以前能治病，在今天依然能够治病，谁能够推翻这一事实？时代推进了，社会变迁了，科学因为摆脱旧的基础和上层建筑的桎梏，而获得进一步的发展，这是谁也不能否认的。我国旧的半殖民地半封建的基础和上层建筑的被消灭、新的社会主义的基础和上层建筑的迅速成长，就给我国的科学发展开辟了一条极为宽广的道路。医学科学工作者的光荣任务，就是要沿着这条宽广的发展道路迅速前进，以便创造出比之过去时代更高级的医学科学，以为我国伟大的社会主义建设事业服务。但是，这种新的和更高级的医学成就，是不能够从天上掉下来的，而是要在继承历史遗产的基础上发展起来。不能批判地吸收和进一步发展古今中外医学遗产中的一切积极的有价值的东西，新的和更高级的医学就根本无从产生。正如列宁教导我们的：“无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会、官僚社会压迫下所创造出来的知识总汇发展底必然结果。”抛弃科学遗产，就是毁灭科学。贺诚同志一笔抹煞祖国医学遗产的观点，就是早经斯大林严加申斥的“穴居野人”的观点，是彻头彻尾反科学的、反马克思列宁主义的。
    按照贺诚同志的“理论”，西医当然也是完全要不得的了。既然“一定的技术只适合于一定的时代”，那末来自欧美资本主义时代的西医，如何能够适合我国人民的需要呢？可见贺诚同志的“理论”丝毫也不反映客观实际事物，而仅只是为否定中医而捏造的。
    西医是以近代自然科学为基础的，比之中医要先进，这是谁也不能否认的。因此党对西医，从来是重视的。但是西医并没有把全部世界医学知识包括无遗，中医至今还能治愈许多为西医所不能治愈的疾病，这也是谁也不能否认的。中医一经同近代自然科学相结合，必将大放异彩，对近代世界医学提出光辉的贡献，这是完全可以肯定的。但贺诚同志既不承认中国人民过去有过什么医学成就，也不相信中国人民今后能有什么医学创造，坚持以“西医代替中医”。这就是贺诚同志全部否定中医的“理论”的出发点。
    三
    数年来，贺诚同志就是以他的这种错误的“理论”指导中医工作的，因而在中医政策上发生了一系列的错误。
    第一、限制中医业务。贺诚同志在计算全国卫生工作力量时说：“按中国人口来说，如果一千人配备一个医生的话，就要有四十五万个医生。现在仅有四万个左右医生，那就差得太远。”我国有中医五十万，在贺诚同志看来，连一个西医也不顶。因此他说：农村基层卫生组织中的医务人员的来源“一方面靠学校的培养，一方面……从大城市的医务人员中输送”。城市医院和门诊部更不能让中医参加，因为“即使政府将中医安插在医院和门诊部工作，如果本身不进步，还是会被淘汰的”。贺诚同志是根本不打算吸收中医到国家卫生机构中去工作的。
    对于私人开业的中医，中央卫生部“中医诊所管理暂行条例施行细则”中规定，中医诊所要负责进行传染病防治工作、卫生宣传工作、环境卫生工作、疫情报告及其他有关公共卫生工作等。但关于中医的政治及经济待遇问题，却一字未提，许多中医每年无代价地参加劳动达四、五十天到六、七十天之久，严重地影响到中医的生活，以致部分中医迫不得已而“洗手”改行。
    对于我国百分之八十的人民赖以治病的中药问题，贺诚同志长期不加过问。中药生药共两千多种，常用药也有三、四百种之多。但中央卫生部一九五三年出版的“中华人民共和国药典”中，收载的生药很少，对于大部分中药采取不承认的态度。
    中医无论在医疗预防、卫生防疫和爱国卫生运动中，都起着极其重大的作用，这是有目共睹的事实。我国医务人员不是太多，而是太少了。因此多扩大一分中医业务，就对人民健康多一分利益，对社会主义建设多一分利益，这是一个显而易见的道理。发展中医业务，壮大中医队伍，使之为人民服务，这是党的团结中医的政策的根本目的。而贺诚同志却偏要用种种办法来限制中医业务，缩小中医队伍，减少中医为人民服务的机会，以致增加了人民看病用药的困难。这种行为除了出自卑鄙的资产阶级宗派主义的心理之外，还能讲出什么别的道理呢？
    第二、中医资格审查。中医资格审查的措施是根据贺诚同志制造的所谓中医“资格”去审查全国中医，合格者发给医师证书，不合格者取消其医师资格。农村中医约占全国中医的百分之八十。农村中医审查结果，以中央卫生部直接领导进行的华北区六十八个县为例，有百分之九十以上的中医被认为“不合格”。
    贺诚同志曾经说：中医“为兵不可能，为工机会也少，所以将来的发展主要是为农”。按照贺诚同志原来的计划，在农村要实行“先中医，后中西医合作，最后以西医代替之”的办法。按照这个计划，农村中医存在的时间应该是最长的了。因为要培养几十万西医来代替中医，决不是十年、二十年可以实现的。然而贺诚同志却用中医资格审查的办法对农村中医来了个“一扫光”。问题的严重，实在是难于想像的！
    中医资格审查的重要办法之一是中医考试。天津市考试及格的中医尚不及应考中医的百分之十。如果普遍考试一下，全国能有多少“及格”中医，也是不难想像的。
    现在让我们来看一看贺诚同志审查和考试中医的内容吧。
    据以审查中医的所谓“资格”，共有六条：一、持有四年制以上的中医医学校毕业证书者；二、经中央或大区卫生部考试及格者；三、经省、直辖市人民政府卫生机关发给中医医师证书或考试及格证书者；四、原领有国民党（或伪满）中央政府中医师证书、考试及格证书者；五、中医进修学校毕业者；六、领有临时中医证书，工作二年从无过失者。但六条中除了第四条有些实际内容之外，其他各条，可以说基本上是空的。因为在中央卫生部审查中医之前，全国各省、市以上卫生机关，一般既没有审查和考试过中医，又没有批准过什么“临时”中医；全国审查中医的工作开始后，中医进修学校毕业学生尚不足千人；解放前，中医学校毕业生不仅为数极少，而且差不多完全包括在国民党和伪满政府批准的合格中医数字以内。但据卫生部统计，国民党和伪满政府，数十年来发给过证件的中医师总共不过五万人，即使这些中医至今仍然全部健在，全部继续执行中医业务，也不过是我国中医总数的百分之十。用这样的所谓资格标准来审查中医，其结果，绝大部分中医要被淘汰，这难道不是贺诚同志的意料中的事吗？而且，我们也不知道贺诚同志有什么理由确信国民党和伪满政府对中医的审查的正确性，而无条件地加以全盘承认。
    据以考试中医的必试课目内容共有四种，其中中医课目只有一种，西医课目占绝大部分。由此可见，一切被考试及格的中医，主要不是因为他们有丰富的中医知识（有也用不上），而是因为他们懂得一些西医。贺诚同志的考试，实际上并不是为了选拔中医，而是企图从中医中选拔出一批西医，这难道不是很明白的事情吗？以西医课目考试中医，其用心之卑鄙，真是达到不能言喻的程度了。
    如果不是为了消灭中医，而是为了更好地团结、教育和使用中医，分别不同对象，适当地采取审查、考试和其他办法，对中医的技术和经验进行一番考核，是可以的，也是必要的。但在进行这种考核的时候，也应该依靠群众，听一听群众的呼声。诊断是否正确，治疗是否有效，这对于患病服药的人们来说，是最具体、也最现实不过的问题。服药后，有效就有效，无效就无效，来不得半点虚假。因此，只要确实能为人民治病，即或仅有一技之长，能为人民治好一种疾病，为实践所证实，为人民所信任，他就具有足够的中医资格。真正为人民所信赖的中医，是任何人也消灭不了的。贺诚同志既不相信群众，又不承认事实，凭空臆造一套所谓中医“资格”，作为取舍中医的标准，这是十足的唯心主义，是极端卑鄙恶劣的资产阶级心理的表现。
    第三、中医进修。贺诚同志给中医指出的唯一出路就是进修。贺诚同志说：“所谓进修，就是学习现代科学医学的基本知识……用科学医学的基本知识去解释问题，以代替唯心的方法。”他说：“如果也办中医学校，教以中医的学理和诊断方法，是不经济的。学完了中医，将来还要进修，也是不经济的地方。”“如果办进修学校，还教中医理论，对中医的前途并不有利。”“如果说这就是中医西医化，我想这是好的。”一言以蔽之，必须放弃中医，学习西医，才是中医的唯一出路。长春市经过进修的中医，转为西医的占百分之四十三。这就是贺诚同志中医进修的“收获”。既不准举办中医学校学习中医，又不准医学院校讲授中医课程，仅有的中医进修学校，则又只准学西医，不准学中医，最终会有什么样的结果，是十分清楚的。
    中医进修是完全必要的。在进修过程中，让中医学习一部分西医的基本知识，是完全应该的。但作为唯一为中医举办的“正式学校性质”的进修学校的主要课程，无论如何应该是关于中医的。道理很简单，因为中医很有用，因为进修的成员是中医而不是西医。所谓中医“科学化”，是要运用近代的科学理论和方法，对中医的学理和经验，进行系统的研究、整理，取其精华，去其糟粕，把其中一切具有科学价值的东西发掘出来，发扬光大，充实到近代医学的宝库中去。因此，中医“科学化”，绝不是短短一年的中医进修学校所能担当得起来的任务，这须要中西医亲密合作，进行长期的学习和研究，特别是须要西医学中医，须要专门的研究机关来作这项工作。贺诚同志对于中医研究工作根本不重视，却错误地强调中医学西医，并且美其名曰“科学化”，这不过是借中医“科学化”之名，而行其中医“西医化”之实而已。
    从以上几点，只能得出这样的结论：贺诚同志对待中医的政策，是利用、限制和消灭中医的政策，和党的团结中医的政策针锋相对，毫无共同之处。应当指出，由于党的及时制止和全国人民的坚决反对，贺诚同志的“政策”是没有实现的；但即使这样，它已经阻碍了党的团结中西医的政策的正确实施，已经给我国人民的卫生事业带来了难以计算的损失。
    四
    更为严重的是，贺诚同志的错误，早经党中央和毛泽东同志多次的批评教育，令其切实改正；但他长期固执己见，坚持错误，拒绝党对他的领导。他的理由是：卫生工作是“特殊”的科学技术工作，党中央“不懂得科学技术”，所以就领导不了卫生工作。这种否定党对科学技术工作的领导的荒谬思想，正是贺诚同志的资产阶级思想发展的顶点，是他的一切错误的根源，是他的一切错误中的最根本的错误。
    科学技术是我们赖以建设社会主义的武器。一切科学技术部门必须严格遵循党依据马克思列宁主义原则所制定的路线、政策和建设计划，来进行自己的工作，把自己部门的工作，看作是社会主义建设的一个战斗的组成部分，在统一的指挥下前进，才能有效地为社会主义服务，成为真正有用的建设工具。否则，脱离党的路线，为所欲为，必然迷失方向，给建设事业带来严重危害。党指出要集中主要力量发展社会主义工业，而贺诚同志却偏要长期不管工业卫生工作；党指出要团结和发挥中医力量为人民服务，而贺诚同志却偏要去限制、消灭中医，使有用的科学技术得不到正确的运用，这难道还不足以说明科学技术离开党的领导的危险吗？
    科学技术工作有其特殊性，但唯一能够正确反映科学的一般规律的科学，是党的理论基础——辩证唯物主义。因此，任何科学工作如果不能稳固地建立在战斗的马克思列宁主义的基础之上，就抵挡不住资产阶级观念的攻击，因而也就不可能得到真正的发展。就是说，只有精通马克思列宁主义的党，才能够最完善地领导科学的发展。而贺诚同志所犯的否定民族医学遗产的错误，就是违反马克思列宁主义科学原理的必然结果。而且我们的党，是一个同广大群众时刻保持密切联系的党，有成千上万的忠实于社会主义建设事业的科学工作者团结在党的周围，这就是党的力量所在，就是党的无穷无尽的知识源泉。党是能够充分集中群众的智慧，善于运用科学工作者们的知识来领导科学技术工作的。把党的知识和广大群众的知识对立起来的看法，是完全违反马克思列宁主义的原则的。
    一切科学技术工作者如果要使自己所掌握的科学技术更好地为人民服务，就应当决心服务于人民，决心把自己的一切成果交给人民。也就是说，要作一个真正自觉的、光荣的人民科学工作者，就必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的路线和政策，以提高觉悟，改造思想，树立革命的人生观和世界观。卫生部门所以长期政治空气稀薄，工作效率不高，广大医务人员的力量得不到充分发挥，这和贺诚同志的不要政治，不要马克思列宁主义，不要党的领导，有很大关系。
    贺诚同志的错误的严重教训是：一切工作，包括科学技术工作，必须严格放在党的领导之下，才能得到正确的发展，才能成为真正有用的东西。没有正确的政治领导，就根本谈不到有正确的业务领导，这是一条真理。
    贺诚同志的错误，给全国人民带来了重大的损失，并且在卫生部门中散布下极其恶劣的思想影响，成为卫生工作前进的重大障碍。因此，必须彻底批判贺诚同志的错误思想，并从这个批判中提高广大卫生工作人员的思想觉悟，彻底纠正卫生部门中的非政治倾向，使人民的卫生事业大踏步地向前迈进。
