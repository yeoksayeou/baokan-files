Problems Must Be Solved Once Discovered

After Sun Rulin and Yan Chenglun, middle peasants from Daijia Village, Seventh District, Ziyang County, Shandong Province, joined the cooperative, they had some complaints because the cooperative did not handle their livestock properly. One evening, the two men whispered their concerns to each other. One said, "I don't know what the benefits of joining the cooperative are. As soon as I joined, I lost more than ten yuan on my ox." The other said, "That's right, my horse wouldn't sell for less than ninety yuan, let alone a hundred! But when I joined the cooperative, they only valued it at seventy-five! They say it's voluntary and mutually beneficial, but as I see it, the cooperative is only looking for benefits for the poor peasants."

Their conversation was overheard by Zhou Qingxi, a Communist Party member who happened to be passing by. That evening, Zhou Qingxi reported the situation to the Party branch committee.

The branch committee attached great importance to the situation reported by Zhou Qingxi and decided to convene a general meeting of Party members to discuss how to further mobilize the cooperative members ideologically, and at the same time, appropriately deal with the unreasonable problems in the assessment of the means of production. After the meeting, the branch on the one hand sent Party members to conduct individual talks with Sun Rulin and Yan Chenglun; on the other hand, through the cooperative affairs committee, it checked the pricing of the nine livestock that had joined the cooperative and made adjustments to those that were indeed unfair and unreasonable. For example, the pricing of Sun Rulin's and Yan Chenglun's livestock was adjusted. It was precisely because the Party branch promptly solved the problems as soon as they were discovered that the cooperative members became even more enthusiastic about taking the road of cooperation. Sun Rulin said to others, "I must be a good cooperative member."

    发现问题就要解决
    山东滋阳县七区代家村中农孙如林和颜成伦入社后，因为社内对他们的牲畜处理得不适当，都有些意见。有一天晚上，这两个人便在一起低声细语地谈心。一个说：“入社还不知好处在哪里，一进门一头牛就先吃了十几元的亏。”另一个说：“可不是，我的马卖不上一百块，也掉不下九十多，入了社只给打了七十五！ 说是自愿互利，依我看，社里只是处处给贫农找好处。”
    他们的话给正在旁边路过的共产党员周清喜听到了，周清喜当天晚上就把这个情况向支部委员会作了汇报。
    支部委员会很重视周清喜反映的情况，决定召开党员大会，讨论如何进一步对社员进行思想发动，同时对生产资料评议工作中不合理的问题加以适当处理。会后，支部一方面派党员和孙如林、颜成伦进行个别谈话；另一方面，通过社务委员会对入社的九头牲畜的作价作了检查，对确实不够公平合理的进行调整，像孙如林和颜成伦的牲口作价就都得到了调整。正是因为党支部一发现问题就及时加以解决，社员们走合作化道路的劲头就更足了。孙如林就跟人说：“我一定要当个好社员。”
