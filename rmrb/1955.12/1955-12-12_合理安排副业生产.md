    Rationally Arrange Sideline Production
    In the villages of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, there are flocks of ducks. Here, rivers crisscross, ditches are everywhere, raising ducks is convenient, and there are very generous profits.
    Some agricultural production cooperatives, seeing the large profits from raising ducks, abandoned agricultural production and raised ducks in large quantities. Liang Huashen, the director of the Caotang No. 1 Cooperative in Gangkou District, Zhongshan County, even sold his oxen to raise ducks. During the severe spring famine this year, he disregarded the lack of food for some members and took the stored rice to feed the ducks. In Baisha Bay, Zhangjiabian District of this county, there is a Fengle Agricultural Cooperative with only thirty-one households, but they drew eight laborers to raise ducks and eight laborers to raise pigs. During the lean season, their pigs and ducks ate seven thousand catties of rice, making it impossible to hand in the public grain in full.
    Sideline production is an important means of increasing the income of cooperative members. But sideline production should never affect agriculture. Practices such as Caotang No. 1 Cooperative selling oxen to raise ducks, and Fengle Cooperative wasting large amounts of food to feed pigs and ducks are wrong. Recently, the Zhongshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in rectifying the cooperatives and consolidating the Party, criticized the above-mentioned erroneous practices. The County Committee requested that all villages rationally arrange sideline production when discussing production plans, and especially determine the correct ratio between sideline production such as raising pigs and feeding ducks, and agricultural production.

    合理安排副业生产
    广东珠江三角洲地区的乡村，都有成群成群的鸭子。这里河流纵横，沟渠遍野，养鸭便利，又有十分优厚的利润。
    有些农业生产合作社，看见养鸭利润大，就放弃了农业生产，大批大批地养起鸭来。中山县港口区草塘一社的社主任梁华深，竟把耕牛卖掉来养鸭。在今年春荒严重的时候，他不顾部分社员缺乏口粮，把存留的稻谷拿去喂鸭。这个县的张家边区白沙湾，有一个仅有三十一户的丰乐农业合作社，他们却抽了八个劳动力去养鸭，八个劳动力去养猪。在青黄不接的时候，他们的猪鸭却吃掉了七千斤稻谷，弄得公粮都不能交齐。
    副业，是增加社员收入的重要手段。但副业无论如何不能影响农业。像草塘一社卖掉耕牛来养鸭，丰乐社因为喂猪养鸭大批地浪费食粮，这些做法都是错误的。最近中共中山县委在整顿合作社和整党工作中，对于上述错误做法都进行了批判。县委要求各村在讨论生产规划时，要合理安排副业生产，特别要确定养猪、喂鸭等副业生产和农业生产的正确比例。
