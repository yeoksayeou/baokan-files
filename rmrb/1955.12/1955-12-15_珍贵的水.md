    Precious Water
    By Our Correspondent Shen Shi

    The people surveying the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Yumen to Hami came from the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains. They had crossed high mountains, waded through rapid currents, traversed thorns, and climbed cliffs; they had smelled the scent of decaying leaves in the forest. But in this area west of Yumen, the situation was clearly different. Here, there were no forests that blotted out the sky and the sun, no rivers flowing day and night like the Jialing River, no peaks piercing the clouds like the Qinling Mountains and the Wushaoling Mountains. What lay before them were weathered crags and boundless, desolate Gobi deserts. Five hundred kilometers away from the highway, not a single household could be found. In places with reeds and camel thorns, only the footprints of wild camels and gazelles could sometimes be found. Water became the most precious thing for the surveyors.

    Among them, some were born in the Xiangjiang, Tuojiang, Jialingjiang, and Qiantangjiang river basins. In those lands of rice and fish, water was readily available at their doorstep. None of them had expected water to be so precious. When they first came to this area, the cooks had to drive teams of camels to carry water from afar. A round trip for the camels took two or three days. The water brought back by the camels was often not enough for people and livestock. Later, trucks were used to transport water, with long trips being more than 140 kilometers round trip, and shorter trips being sixty or seventy kilometers. The water brought back by the trucks was only allowed to be used for cooking and drinking. They would get up in the morning, wipe their faces with a dry towel, have breakfast, and go to the construction site with a pot of water. November 12th was a day off for the fourth selection team. On this day, the instructor instructed the driver to load a truck of water so that the comrades could wash their clothes because everyone had not washed their clothes or rinsed their mouths for more than twenty days.

    They were indeed a little unaccustomed to this kind of life when they first came. But as the days passed, they got used to it. One day without water to drink was nothing; two or three months without a bath was nothing; twenty days without rinsing their mouths or changing their clothes was nothing. What made them most anxious was the water problem for locomotives and stations on this section of the line in the future.

    How many stations will be set up along this section of the line, which is more than 500 kilometers long, and how many trains will pass through each day and night? If the water problem cannot be solved, it will be necessary to replace steam locomotives with internal combustion locomotives. Running internal combustion locomotives requires the consumption of a large amount of diesel and gasoline. Engineers and surveyors are considering this issue. We must save diesel and gasoline for the country, and we must do everything possible to find water. This arduous task was undertaken by the comrades of the water supply team.

    Where can we find water in this dry, unsheltered Gobi desert? Away from the highway, there are no people, so who can we ask about water sources? Difficulties cannot defeat the people nurtured by the Party and Chairman Mao. Is there no water? Water may be found in places where wild camels and gazelles often appear; water may be found in places where water-absorbing plants such as reeds grow; water may be found in places with alkaline beaches and sandstone and conglomerate rocks. So people set off in groups of two or three, taking dry food, drinking water, and tools.

    Like the work they did every day, one morning, Li Quan of Group 1 led Lu Dengkun, Li Dehui, and three others to find water twenty miles away. They ran all day and found not a drop of water. "Today we ran in vain again. If this continues, when will we be able to find water?" one of his companions said disappointedly.

    "If we don't find water today, we'll come again tomorrow. In this water-scarce area, we can't find water every day. This requires our patience. It's no use being anxious," Li Quan comforted his companion.

    It was getting darker and darker, but where was the tent? It was even more difficult to find a place to camp. Everyone knew that they had taken the wrong road, so they found a place with firewood, lit a bonfire, and the six tired people lay down by the fire and fell asleep.

    At this time, signal fires were lit on the high ground near the tent, waiting for the comrades to return, but it was late at night, and Li Quan's group had not been seen. Everyone became uneasy. "They must be lost. Let's go find them!" People rode out on camels.

    At dawn, the six people saw the direction clearly and moved forward again. They were so thirsty that they could hardly bear it. They shook their kettles, but there was not a drop of water left. As they walked, suddenly someone shouted: "Look! There are camels ahead."

    Everyone rushed forward in unison. As they approached the camels, they realized that they were people from their own team. Everyone gathered around and drank the water they brought to their hearts' content.

    People continued to overcome various difficulties and searched for water everywhere.

    Engineer Yang Songwu joined the water-finding team. One day, he, Han Depu, Ren Tianshen, and a few others went to find water. After walking more than a dozen miles, Yang Songwu realized that there was a lot of sandstone in this area. He thought: "There may be water in this place." The people traveling with him all went ahead, only he and Ren Tianshen stayed behind. He saw a crack in a sandstone rock filled with rubble. He walked up to the sandstone, pushed aside the rubble, took out a piece and said to Ren Tianshen: "Take a look!"

    Ren Tianshen took it and said in surprise: "Fossil!"

    The people who were walking in front turned back, and everyone picked up several pieces of coral and shell fossils here. They understood in their hearts that, based on these fossils, they could determine the age of the strata, and based on the age of the strata, they could create a geological map. The geological map could reveal the geological structure. If the geological structure was a synclinal layer, then it might contain water.

    They put the fossils away and continued to move forward. They came to a dry riverbed covered with reeds. Ren Tianshen said: "Let's dig here and see if there is any water." They started digging a pit. They dug to one meter, but there was no water. Engineer Yang said: "Keep digging! There may be water." They dug further, and suddenly someone shouted: "Water!" Water was constantly seeping out of the mud seams.

    Good news followed one after another. Water was found in the Xingxingxia area, and water was also found in the area sixty or seventy kilometers to one hundred and forty kilometers away from Hami. Although water was found, it did not solve the problem, because a large station would need 800 to 1,000 tons of water per day and night, and a small station would need 400 to 500 tons of water per day and night. This requires further searching for water.

    In winter, the Gobi desert is often swept by howling winds, and blizzards are stirred up when cold air passes through. Drilling teams have arrived on this section of the line one after another, and wooden houses and cold-proof equipment for winter construction have also been transported to the construction site. In a few days, they will begin drilling and finally uncover the mystery of water.

    The Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway has been opened to traffic to Zhangye, and the opening of the line west of Yumen is not far away. Friends! When this section of the line is opened to traffic, when you board the train and travel west from Yumen, when the train attendant pours you a cup of clear tea, please think of those who have suffered all kinds of hardships in the Gobi desert in order to find water. You will definitely feel how clear and sweet, how precious this cup of tea is.

    珍贵的水
    本报记者　沈石
    勘测兰新铁路玉门到哈密段的人，有的来自宝成铁路的北段，有的来自大兴安岭的原始森林。他们曾经翻过高山，涉过急流，钻过荆棘，爬过悬崖，嗅过森林中树叶腐烂的气味。但是，在这玉门以西的地区，情况显然不同了，这里没有遮天蔽日的森林，没有和嘉陵江一样昼夜奔流的河水，没有像秦岭、乌鞘岭高插入云的峰峦。横在他们前面的，是风化的巉岩，是无边无际的戈壁。离开公路线五百多公里，找不到一户人家。在长有芦苇和骆驼刺的地方，有时只可以发现野骆驼和黄羊的脚印，水成了勘测人员最珍贵的东西。
    他们当中，有的出生在湘江、沱江、嘉陵江和钱塘江流域，在那鱼米之乡，出门就可以见到水。他们谁也没有料到水是这样的珍贵。当他们初来这个地区的时候，炊事员们要赶着一队一队的骆驼，到远处去驮水。骆驼来回一趟，得两三天。骆驼驮回的水，往往不够人和牲畜饮用。后来改用汽车运水，远的路程，来回一百四十多公里，近的也是六、七十公里。汽车运回的水，也只准用作煮饭和饮料。他们清晨起来，用干手巾抹一抹脸，吃过早饭，带着一壶水，便上工地去了。十一月十二日，是选线第四分队的人休息的日子，这一天，指导员吩咐驾驶员去装运一车水，让同志们洗洗衣服。因为大家有二十多天没洗过衣服、没漱过口了。
    这样的生活，他们初来的时候，的确有些不习惯。可是日子久了，也就惯了。一天没有水喝，算不了什么；两、三个月不洗澡，算不了什么；二十来天不漱口，不换衣服，算不了什么。最使他们焦虑不安的，便是将来这段线路机车和车站的用水问题。
    这段长达五百多公里的线路，沿线将设多少车站，每昼夜将通过多少列车。如果水的问题不能解决，势必用内燃机车来代替蒸汽机车。行驶内燃机车，一定要消耗大量的柴油和汽油。工程师和勘测人员都在考虑这个问题。必须为国家节约柴油和汽油，必须想尽一切办法找出水来。这一艰巨的任务，便由给水分队的同志们承担起来了。
    在这干燥的没遮拦的戈壁滩上，从什么地方去找水呢？离开公路线，便没有人烟，向什么人去探问水源呢？困难难不倒党和毛主席教养出来的人，没有水吗？到那野骆驼和黄羊经常出没的地方，可能找到水；到那丛生着像芦苇一类吸水植物的地方，可能找到水；到那有碱滩和砂岩、砾岩的地方，可能找到水。于是人们三三两两地，带着干粮、饮水和工具分头出发了。
    像每天所进行的工作一样，一天早上，一组的黎瑔领着吕登坤、李德辉等五人，出发到二十里路以外的地方找水去了。他们奔走了一天，没有发现一滴水。“今天又白跑了，这样下去，哪一天能找到水呢？”同伴中有一个人失望地说。
    “今天没找到水，明天再来，在这缺水区，并不是每天都可找到水的，这就需要我们的耐心。光着急是没有用的。”黎瑔安慰着同伴。
    天越来越黑了，可是帐篷在什么地方呢？要找到宿营的地点更加困难了。大家都知道走错了路，于是找到了一块有柴火的地方，燃起篝火，六个疲乏了的人，都躺在火边睡着了。
    这时在帐篷附近的高地上烧起了信火，等待着同志们的归来，可是夜深了，还没有望见黎瑔这一小组的人，大家都不安起来。“他们一定迷路了，咱们去寻找吧！”人们骑着骆驼出动了。
    天色微明，六个人看清了方向，又前进了。口渴得实在难受，摇一摇水壶，连一滴水也没有。走着走着，忽然，有人叫道：“看！前面有骆驼。”
    大家不约而同地向前赶。走近骆驼，原来是自己队上的人，大家围拢来，把他们带的水喝个痛快。
    人们继续克服各种困难，到处去找水。
    工程师杨松戊加入了找水的小组，一天，他和韩德普、任天申几个人一道去找水，走了十几里路，杨松戊发觉这一带砂岩很多，他想：“这地方可能有水。同行的人都走向前面去了，只有他和任天申留在后面，他看到一处砂岩的裂缝中，堆积着许多碎石，他走近砂岩，拨开碎石，取出一块对任天申说：“你来瞧瞧！”
    任天申接过去，惊讶地说：“化石！”
    走在前面的人又折回来，大家在这里拾到了好几块珊瑚和贝壳的化石。他们心中明白，根据这些化石可以判定岩层的年代，根据岩层的年代作成地质图，地质图可发现地质构造，假若地质构造是向斜层，那么可能含水。
    他们把化石收藏好，又继续前进，走到一处干涸的长满了芦苇的河床，任天申说：“我们在这里挖一挖，看有没有水。”他们开始挖坑，挖到一公尺，没有水，杨工程师说：“继续挖吧！可能有水。”他们再挖下去，突然有人喊道：“水！”只见水从泥缝中不断地渗透出来。
    喜讯接着传来，星星峡地区找到了水，离哈密六、七十公里到一百四十公里的地区也找到了水。水虽然找到了，但是并没有解决问题，因为将来大的车站一昼夜需水八百到一千吨，小的车站，一昼夜需水四、五百吨。这就需要进一步找水。
    冬天，戈壁滩上经常狂风咆哮，寒流过境的时候，激起了暴风雪。钻探队的人陆续来到了这一段线路上，准备冬季施工的木房和防寒设备也运到了工地。再过一些日子，他们将要开始钻探，最后揭开水的谜了。
    兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路已经通车到张掖，列车通过玉门以西的线路为期不远了。朋友！当这段线路通车以后，你们坐上火车，从玉门向西行驶的时候，当列车员给你们斟上一杯清茶的时候，请你们想一想那些在戈壁中为了找水而吃尽千辛万苦的人，你们一定会感到这杯茶是多么清甜，这杯茶是多么可贵。
