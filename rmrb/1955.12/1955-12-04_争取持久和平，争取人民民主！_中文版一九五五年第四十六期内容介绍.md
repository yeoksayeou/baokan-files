Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 46, 1955

The Chinese edition of issue No. 46, 1955 of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Wishing the Friendship Between the Peoples of the Soviet Union and India Grows Stronger and More Prosperous!", commenting on the great significance of the visit of Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev to India. The editorial points out: The broad public in India correctly believes that the friendly visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev is a matter of great international significance. The friendly ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and India have been established for a long time. The Soviet Union and India have different national and social systems, but this will not hinder the friendship between the two countries. The friendship between the Soviet Union and India is based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. The practical application of the principles of peaceful diplomacy on which Soviet-Indian friendship is based helps to ease international tensions and weaken the position of the cold war mongers. There is no doubt that the visit of Soviet leaders to friendly India and their interaction with the Indian people and their outstanding leaders will help to develop and strengthen cooperation between the two countries and uphold the lofty cause of peace in Asia and the world.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Strengthen the Italian Communist Party, Expand the Party's Influence" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "Further Development of Agricultural Cooperativization in Czechoslovakia" by K. Krutina, Member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Minister of Agriculture of the Czechoslovak Republic; "The October Revolution and the Arab East" by Khalid Bakdash, General Secretary of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties; and "The Chilean Working People's Struggle for the Freedom and Independence of the Motherland" by Galo González Díaz, General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party.

Togliatti's article is based on his speech at the meeting of Party secretaries in the two administrative regions of Latium and Umbria in Italy on November 8th of this year. In his speech, Togliatti analyzed the current political situation in Italy, pointing out that the influence of the Italian people's movement and the Communist Party among the masses and in domestic political life is growing. He went on to say that we are on the eve of a large-scale election campaign for provincial and municipal councils. We should clearly tell the working people that one of the reasons why we want to strengthen the Italian Communist Party is that we want to ease international tensions. At the same time, we must explain that we cannot assume that the international situation has truly eased simply because the formal relations between the major powers have improved. We should unequivocally tell the people that the reason why we want to strengthen the Party is because we want to win in the provincial and municipal council elections, and in places where we cannot achieve this for the time being, we want to drive the most reactionary forces out of power and prevent them from controlling the leadership of the townships.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第四十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四十六期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“祝苏联和印度两国人民的友谊日益加强和昌盛！”为题发表社论，评论苏联领袖布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问印度的巨大意义。社论指出：印度广大公众都正确地认为布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的友好访问是一件具有重大国际意义的事情。苏联和印度两国人民的友好联系已经建立了很长的时候了。苏联和印度的国家制度和社会制度不同，但是，这并不会妨碍两国之间的友谊。苏印两国之间的友谊以和平共处的原则为基础。实际应用苏印友谊所根据的和平外交政策的原则，是有助于缓和国际紧张局势和削弱冷战贩子的地位的。毫无疑问，苏联领袖访问友好的印度、同印度人民和他们杰出的领袖们的交往，将有助于发展和加强两国之间的合作和维护亚洲以及全世界和平的崇高事业。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的“加强意大利共产党，扩大党的影响”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员、捷克斯洛伐克共和国农业部部长克鲁蒂纳的“进一步发展捷克斯洛伐克的农业合作化运动”，叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党总书记巴克达斯的“十月革命和阿拉伯东方”，智利共产党总书记迪亚斯的“智利劳动人民为祖国的自由和独立而奋斗”。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是他今年十一月八日在意大利拉提乌姆和乌姆布利亚两个行政区的党委书记会议上的讲话。陶里亚蒂在讲话中分析了意大利当前的政治形势，指出意大利人民运动和共产党在群众中、在国内政治生活中的影响日益扩大。他接着说，我们正处在大规模的省市议会竞选运动的前夕。我们应该清楚地告诉劳动人民，我们所以要加强意大利共产党的原因之一是我们要缓和国际紧张局势。同时要说明，我们不能因为大国之间的形式上的关系有了改善，就认为国际局势已经真正缓和下来。我们应当毫不含糊地告诉人民，我们所以要加强党是因为我们要在省市议会选举中取得胜利，而在暂时还不能达到这个目的的地方，我们要把最反动的势力赶下台，不让他们把持市镇的领导。
