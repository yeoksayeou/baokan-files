Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 22nd: Newly appointed caretaker Prime Minister of Jordan, Hazza' al-Majali, announced on the 21st that his government "will not participate in any new treaties or undertake new obligations." Hazza' al-Majali's statement is considered an indication that Jordan will not join the Baghdad Pact before the new elections.

On the same morning, representatives of striking groups in Amman visited Hazza' al-Majali, presenting him with conditions for ending the general strike and demonstrations. These conditions included: the release of political prisoners, guarantees not to join the Baghdad Pact, holding free elections, and providing compensation to the families of those killed and injured by the military police. It is reported that Hazza' al-Majali promised to consider these demands.

An Associated Press dispatch stated that developments indicate that the negotiations conducted by British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer "with Jordanian authorities in Amman have resulted in complete failure."

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: According to a United Press International dispatch from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser announced on the 21st that Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have agreed to provide financial assistance to Jordan.

The same dispatch stated that the purpose of this aid is to replace British financial aid to Jordan. "Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, eager to prevent Jordan from joining the Baghdad Pact, have agreed to financially assist Jordan in order to alleviate British pressure on Amman."

    新华社二十二日讯　安曼消息：新任命的约旦看守政府首相哈谢姆二十一日宣布，他的政府“将不参加任何新条约或承担新的义务”。哈谢姆的声明被认为是表示约旦在新的选举以前不会参加巴格达条约。
    同一天上午，安曼各罢工团体的代表访问了哈谢姆，向他提出了停止总罢工和示威的条件。这些条件包括：释放政治犯、保证不参加巴格达条约、举行自由选举、给被军警杀害和殴伤的人的家属以赔偿。据悉，哈谢姆答应将考虑这些要求。
    美联社在一条消息中说，事态的发展表明，英帝国参谋总长田普勒“在安曼同约旦当局进行的谈判结果是完全失败”。
    新华社二十二日讯　据合众社开罗消息：埃及总理纳赛尔二十一日宣布，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯三个国家已经同意给予约旦财政援助。
    同一条消息说，这种援助的目的是用来代替英国对约旦的财政援助。“切望阻止约旦参加巴格达条约的埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯同意在财政上援助约旦，以便减轻英国对安曼的压力。”
