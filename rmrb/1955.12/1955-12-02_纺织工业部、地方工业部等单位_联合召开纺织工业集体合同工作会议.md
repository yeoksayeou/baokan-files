Textile Industry Department, Local Industry Department, and Other Units
Jointly Convene Textile Industry Collective Contract Work Conference

The Textile Industry Department, the Local Industry Department, and the All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee recently jointly convened the Textile Industry Collective Contract Work Conference in Beijing.

The conference believed that significant progress had been made in promoting collective contracts in the textile industry in 1955. According to preliminary statistics by the end of October, 110 units had already signed collective contracts. The signing of collective contracts in state-owned textile enterprises had exceeded half. Collective contracts had been promoted in various industries such as cotton spinning, wool spinning, flax spinning, silk reeling, silk weaving, printing and dyeing, knitting, and textile machinery. Statistics from 89 textile enterprises that signed collective contracts showed that 66 textile enterprises, after signing collective contracts, played varying degrees of roles in promoting labor competitions, improving enterprise management and trade union work, thereby improving product quality, practicing comprehensive conservation, ensuring the completion and over-completion of national plans, and improving working conditions and the material and cultural life of employees.

Since October 1953, when the Textile Industry Department and the All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee issued the "Joint Instructions on Signing Collective Contracts in State-Owned Factories," considerable experience in signing and implementing collective contracts has been accumulated in the past two years of practice. However, even now, many leaders of textile enterprises still have doubts about collective contracts, mistakenly believing that "collective contracts are useless because there is already a national plan." Or, they emphasize that the "conditions" are not yet available. Therefore, they are not actively promoting collective contracts. The conference criticized this erroneous thinking.

Finally, the conference put forward specific requirements for promoting collective contracts in textile enterprises in 1956: In 1956, state-owned and local state-owned enterprises should universally sign collective contracts in conjunction with the implementation of the 1956 national plan. Public-private joint ventures that have already signed collective contracts in 1955 should continue to sign them in 1956, and those that have not signed should strive to sign collective contracts.

    纺织工业部、地方工业部等单位
    联合召开纺织工业集体合同工作会议
    纺织工业部、地方工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会最近在北京联合召开了纺织工业集体合同工作会议。
    会议认为：一九五五年在纺织工业中推行集体合同有了很大进展，据到十月底的初步统计，已经有一百一十个单位签订了集体合同。在国营纺织企业中签订集体合同的已经超过了半数。集体合同已经推行到棉纺织、毛纺织、麻纺织、缫丝、织绸、印染、针织、纺织机械等不同行业中去。在八十九个签订集体合同的纺织企业中统计，有六十六个纺织企业签订集体合同后，在推动劳动竞赛、改善企业管理和工会工作，从而提高产品质量、厉行全面节约、保证完成与超额完成国家计划，改善劳动条件和职工物质文化生活等方面都起了不同程度的作用。
    自从一九五三年十月，纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会发出“关于在国营工厂中签订集体合同的联合指示”后，在两年来的实践中，已经积累了不少关于签订与实现集体合同的经验。但是，直到现在还有不少纺织企业领导人员对集体合同抱怀疑态度，错误地认为“已经有了国家计划，集体合同就没有作用”。或者，强调还不具备“条件”。因而，对推行集体合同就不积极，会议对这种错误思想进行了批判。
    最后，会议对一九五六年纺织企业推行集体合同提出了具体要求：一九五六年国营和地方国营企业要结合贯彻一九五六年国家计划，普遍签订集体合同。公私合营企业在一九五五年已经签订过集体合同的，一九五六年应继续签订，没有签订的，应争取做到签订集体合同。
