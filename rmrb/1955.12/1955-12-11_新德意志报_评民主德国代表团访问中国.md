Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 10th: The "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on December 9th entitled "Visiting 600 Million People," commenting on the visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to China. The editorial believes that the visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to China is a new contribution to the cause of further strengthening friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

The editorial emphasized that the People's Republic of China, in a short period after its founding, has become a world power, leading the peace camp together with the Soviet Union. The editorial described in detail China's vast land, abundant resources, large population, and the rapid development of industry and agriculture since the founding of the country.

The editorial then stated: The new Germany, embodied by the German Democratic Republic, has forever freed itself from imperialism. The government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, represents a Germany, like China, where political power is in the hands of workers and peasants. This Germany hopes to establish friendship with the people of other countries, it respects the cultures of other countries and learns from them, and it seeks to trade with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The editorial said: The old imperialist Germany once threatened peace and progress, but the new Germany is prepared to defend its common achievements together with all peace-loving people. After the Chinese representative supported the signing of the Warsaw Pact this year in May, and declared that China would be a loyal and reliable friend of the contracting states, the united world peace camp stretched from the Elbe to the Yellow Sea.

The editorial talked about the attitude of some West German political figures towards China recently: Some influential Bonn politicians are demanding that relations with the People's Republic of China be restored, just as with the Soviet Union. Such a step would not be unimportant for further easing international tensions. This step would open up a huge, crisis-free Chinese market for West German industrialists and businessmen.

    “新德意志报”评民主德国代表团访问中国
    新华社柏林十日电　“新德意志报”九日以“访问六亿人民”为题发表社论，评德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中国。社论认为德意志民主共和国政府代表团的访问中国是对进一步加强两国之间的友谊和合作的事业的新的贡献。
    社论着重说，中华人民共和国在立国后的短短的时期中，就成了一个世界大国，同苏联一道领导着和平阵营。社论详细叙述了中国土地的辽阔、资源的丰富、人口的众多以及建国以来工农业的飞跃发展。
    社论接着说：德意志民主共和国所体现的新德国永远摆脱了帝国主义。以格罗提渥总理为首的这个政府代表团代表着同中国一样的、政权掌握在工农手里的德国。这个德国希望同其他国家的人民建立友谊，它尊重其他国家的文化并且向它们学习，它寻求在平等互利的基础上同其他国家贸易。
    社论说：旧的帝国主义的德国曾经威胁和平和进步，但是新的德国准备同一切爱好和平的人民一起保卫他们共同的成就。在中国代表在今年五月支持华沙条约的签订，并且声明中国将作为缔约国家的忠实可靠的朋友以后，团结一致的世界和平阵营就从易北河一直伸展到黄海。
    社论谈到最近西德某些政界人士对中国的态度说：一些有影响的波恩政治家要求像对苏联一样也恢复对中华人民共和国的关系。这样一种步骤对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势并不是不重要的。这种步骤将给西德工商界人士开辟一个巨大的没有危机的中国市场。
