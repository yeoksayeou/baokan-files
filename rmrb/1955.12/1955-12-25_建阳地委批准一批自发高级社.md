The Jianyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province recently held a symposium on spontaneously formed advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Present at the meeting were the chairmen of ten advanced cooperatives that spontaneously emerged in four counties last winter and this spring. Most of the areas where these cooperatives are located are old revolutionary base areas, with relatively high mass awareness and a large number of Party members, Youth League members, and core members. These areas are also mostly small mountain villages where cooperation is needed for agricultural and forestry production. Most of the cooperative members were landless or land-poor peasants before liberation, and the local land was scarce and barren, resulting in low land returns. Therefore, they urgently demanded to establish advanced cooperatives. Because the cadres at that time did not pay attention to leading them, or were afraid of "rash advances" and dared not lead, the masses themselves set up a batch of advanced cooperatives. Over the past year, these ten cooperatives have made significant achievements in agriculture, forestry, and sideline production. Nine cooperatives have increased production compared to last year.

At this meeting, the Jianyang Prefectural Committee approved seven cooperatives to officially become advanced cooperatives. In addition, there are more problems with the other three cooperatives, and the Jianyang Prefectural Committee is helping them study and solve the existing problems in the cooperatives.

    建阳地委批准一批自发高级社
    中共福建省建阳地委最近召开了一次自发高级农业生产合作社座谈会。到会的有去冬今春在四个县自发涌现的十个高级社的社长。这些社所在的地区大都是老区，群众觉悟比较高，党员、团员、骨干比较多，这些地区又多是山区小村，农林业生产需要合作，这些社的社员大部分是解放前无地少地的贫农，加以当地田少而瘦，土地报酬本来较低，所以迫切要求办高级社。由于当时干部不注意领导他们，或怕“冒进”不敢领导，群众就自己办起了一批高级社。一年来，这十个社农业、林业、副业生产都有显著成绩，九个社都比去年增产。
    建阳地委在这次会上批准七个社正式成为高级社；另外，有三个社问题较多，建阳地委正在帮助他们研究解决社里存在的问题。
