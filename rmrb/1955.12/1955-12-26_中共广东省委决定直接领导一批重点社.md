    The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee Decides to Directly Lead a Batch of Key Cooperatives
    The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee recently designated eighteen Provincial Committee Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Committee Members, and responsible personnel related to agricultural collectivization work to directly contact seventy-seven key agricultural production cooperatives across the province. Personnel responsible for directly contacting agricultural production cooperatives will go to the countryside several times a year to directly help these cooperatives solve specific problems within the cooperative. The Provincial Committee also stipulated that the directors of these seventy-seven cooperatives should attend the bi-annual Provincial Committee Secretaries' meetings to report on the work of these cooperatives and provide experience in running cooperatives. The Provincial Committee will also directly convene some of the cooperative directors to participate in temporary professional meetings.
    After the great development of the agricultural collectivization movement, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee has begun to improve its leadership methods and decided to adopt the leadership method of "one pole to the bottom" for all tasks. In November, the Provincial Committee held its first meeting of Provincial Committee Secretaries, where Provincial Committee members met directly with more than 1,700 District Committee Secretaries, Township Branch Secretaries, and Agricultural Production Cooperative Directors to help them study the Party's guidelines and policies on collectivization and summarize their two years of experience in running cooperatives. The Provincial Committee also recently published a "District and Township Cadre Newspaper" to closely connect with the broad masses of District and Township cadres.

    中共广东省委决定直接领导一批重点社
    中共广东省委员会最近指定了省委书记、副书记、委员以及与农业合作化工作有关的负责人员十八人分别直接联系全省的七十七个重点农业生产合作社。负责直接联系农业生产合作社的人员每年将下乡几次，直接帮助这些社解决社内的具体问题。省委还规定这七十七个社的社主任按期出席每年召开两次的全省区委书记会议，报告这些社的工作情况；提供办社经验。省委还将直接召集一部分的社主任参加临时的专业会议。
    中共广东省委在农业合作化运动大发展以后，即已着手改进领导方法，决定对各项工作采用“一竿插到底”的领导方法。十一月间，省委曾经召开了全省区委书记的第一次会议，省委委员和一千七百多名区委书记、乡支部书记、农业生产合作社主任直接见了面，帮助他们学习了党关于合作化的方针政策，并且总结了他们两年来的办社经验。省委最近还出版了一份“区乡干部报”，来密切联系广大区乡干部。（本报集体通讯员南方日报编辑部）
