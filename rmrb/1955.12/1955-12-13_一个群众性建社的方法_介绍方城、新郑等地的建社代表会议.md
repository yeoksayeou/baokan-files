    A Mass Method of Establishing Cooperatives
    ——Introducing the Cooperative Establishment Representative Conferences in Fangcheng, Xinzheng and Other Places
    Lin Hong
    In many counties of Henan, after a surge around the autumn harvest, hundreds or even thousands of agricultural cooperatives were established in about twenty days to a month. In the scope of a single township, often ten, eight, or even a dozen agricultural cooperatives are being established simultaneously. In response to this situation, counties such as Xinzheng and Fangcheng have adopted the method of convening cooperative establishment representative conferences, based on small districts or joint townships. Practice has proven that convening such cooperative establishment representative conferences is a good way for Party organizations, especially county and district Party committees, to lead the mass establishment and expansion of cooperatives.
    These cooperative establishment representative conferences (also called mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences in some places) are convened under the direct leadership of the district Party committee or joint township (i.e., central township) work teams. Participants include leading cadres from township Party branches and Communist Youth League branches, cooperative chairpersons, and poor peasant activists who are preparing to establish cooperatives. Generally, four conferences are held according to the four different stages of the cooperative establishment movement. The first cooperative establishment representative conference is convened in the early stage of the cooperative establishment movement, mainly to solve the ideological mobilization work for cooperative establishment and to implement the class line. The second conference is convened when the cooperative establishment movement enters the stage of assessing the means of production, mainly to check the work of the previous stage and to solve the problem of how to conscientiously implement the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy in the assessment of the means of production. The third conference is convened after the assessment of the means of production is basically completed and the stage of electing cooperative cadres is entered. In addition to studying how to further implement the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy and checking and correcting deviations in the assessment of the means of production, the focus is on studying how to select good cooperative cadres, improve the cooperative's leadership, and establish various systems within the cooperative. The fourth conference is convened when the cooperative establishment work is basically completed. The content of this conference, in addition to checking and summarizing the entire cooperative establishment work and resolving outstanding issues, also studies the establishment and improvement of the new cooperative's production management and financial management, especially production arrangements. Because the establishment, expansion, and rectification of old cooperatives are often carried out simultaneously in a region, and the content of rectifying old cooperatives is basically the same as that of establishing new cooperatives, the issue of rectifying old cooperatives is interspersed and studied at each conference.
    At these conferences, the district Party committee or joint township work team leader usually first makes a report, affirming the work achievements of a period and pointing out the problems that need to be solved in the future; then, discussions are held by township or group, checking the situation household by household, identifying problems, referring to relevant documents, and exchanging and introducing experiences. For example, when the Quanqiao Joint Township (including six townships) in Fangcheng County convened the first cooperative establishment representative conference, it was found that the work of many Party members, cadres, and activists was not thorough enough. They mistakenly believed that the masses were enthusiastic and there was no need to carry out ideological work. District cadre Zhao Changgui said: "If we don't mobilize the masses, we will still have enough households to join the cooperative! What’s the use of mobilizing the masses!" As a result, Party members and cadres lacked a concrete understanding of the ideological trends of the masses of all classes and the foundation of the work, and they did not grasp the situation of the movement. At the same time, the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants and forcibly bringing middle peasants into cooperatives appeared in various townships. Among the sixty-four representatives attending the conference, thirty-eight were only superficially relying on the poor peasants. Eight representatives said: "Establishing a cooperative is like the bones of the poor peasants and the flesh of the middle peasants. Poor peasants don't have livestock, and we can't build a cooperative relying solely on poor peasants." They also lacked vigilance against the sabotage activities of class enemies, believing that the enemies would be "honest" when the masses were mobilized. Therefore, at this cooperative establishment representative conference, the joint township work team organized the attending representatives to study again Parts IV and V of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and criticized right-leaning ideas and unthorough work styles in light of actual examples. The conference introduced the example of the failure of Zhai Shubao, the Party branch secretary of Tushan Township, in running a cooperative. When establishing a cooperative in the autumn of 1954, Zhai Shubao left the poor peasant mutual aid group he led to lead the mutual aid group of wealthy middle peasants such as Hu Xuezhong to transform into a cooperative. Because wealthy peasants such as Hu Xuezhong were not sincere in joining the cooperative, disputes often arose within the cooperative, and the cooperative could not be consolidated and had to be turned back into a mutual aid group. Using this method of combining theory with practice, the attending representatives further understood that in establishing cooperatives, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's class policy and do a good job in ideological mobilization and the review of new cooperative members. Then, everyone carried out a three-check investigation in each cooperative: checking the ideological trends of all classes, checking the composition of cooperative members, and checking the ideological motives for joining the cooperative. Finally, the joint township work team approved the members of the cooperatives one by one. In this way, the quality of the cooperatives was guaranteed.
    The content and method of the conferences are not fixed and can be determined according to local conditions. For example, Xue Dian District in Xinzheng County convened cooperative establishment representative conferences based on small districts, and each township in this district was divided into two batches to establish cooperatives. Therefore, when convening the second cooperative establishment representative conference, after the responsible comrades of the small district reported on their work, the old cooperatives and the cooperatives that had basically completed the assessment of the means of production focused on checking whether the mutually beneficial policy had been correctly implemented in the assessment of the means of production, and whether production had been organized after the assessment; the poor peasant activists who were establishing cooperatives and preparing to establish cooperatives focused on studying the issue of who to admit into the cooperatives. In order to help everyone correctly understand the mutually beneficial policy and the methods of assessing the means of production, several model cooperatives were also organized to introduce their experiences in this regard. Finally, the responsible comrades of the small district made a summary, raised problems, and affirmed methods. Everyone felt very satisfied with this, reflecting that "It really solves problems;" "Many days of meetings are not as good as this one day, this is really much stronger than learning policies by looking at books."
    Because the cooperative establishment work is relatively intense and the movement is developing very quickly, the cooperative establishment representative conferences should not be too long, generally one to two days is appropriate. In such a short period of time, in order to hold the conference well and truly achieve the purpose of clarifying the situation and solving problems, the district Party committee or joint township work team must do the following: First, they must have a relatively detailed understanding of the cooperative movement in their area beforehand, analyze and propose the most important current problems, and clarify the content of the conference. Only by conscientiously doing this work can they guide the attending representatives to discuss and speak around the central topics after the conference begins; can they study and come up with solutions to problems before the conference, so that the problems raised at the conference can be solved in a timely and correct manner. To understand the situation in advance, the method of having the work team members stationed in each township and the district cadres report back to the joint township and district half a day in advance, or convening a reporting meeting of the Party branch secretaries of each township can be adopted. Second, typical speeches must be prepared in advance. The district Party committee or joint township work team should go deep down to understand the situation and discover problems that are common. In this way, the leadership can truly have a clear understanding and better select and cultivate typical speeches to guide the movement concretely. At the second cooperative establishment representative conference held in Quanqiao Joint Township, the joint township work team leader introduced the problems that occurred in the assessment of land output in the first cooperative of the joint township and the methods for solving them, which greatly educated the attending representatives; some townships had not been able to assess the land output well in three days, and after the conference, they quickly solved the problem. Finally, the members of the conference should be determined appropriately, especially the poor peasant activists and the main cadres of the township must participate. In this way, the township cadres and activists can start working immediately after returning to the township, so as to avoid conveying resolutions and instructions layer by layer, which would delay the time and affect the work.
    Adopting the method of cooperative establishment representative conferences to lead the cooperative establishment work first solves the problem of having few and weak cadres, enabling the leadership to stay ahead of the mass movement and guide the movement in a timely manner. For example, Quanqiao Joint Township in Fangcheng County has a total of six townships, while the joint township work team actually only has seven people working in the townships. Except for one township with two staff members stationed, the remaining five townships can only have one staff member stationed. At that time, in addition to cooperative establishment being the central task of this joint township, there were also multiple tasks such as production, autumn grain collection, Party rectification, and cooperative rectification, and the township-stationed work team members could not use all their strength to guide the cooperative establishment work; moreover, two of them had not done rural work, and two of them were not very good at cooperative establishment work. After this joint township adopted the cooperative establishment representative conference, it not only learned about the progress of the movement in a timely and systematic manner, but also used the collective wisdom of cadres and the masses to guide the entire cooperative establishment work, thereby effectively resolving the contradiction of having few and weak cadres and many work tasks. For the leadership of the county Party committee, if the entire county adopts the method of cooperative establishment representative conferences, with county Party committee members or the main cadres of the county separately guiding the districts or central townships to hold such conferences well, this would also enable them to understand the situation more timely, comprehensively, and concretely than if the county Party committee were to grasp the districts or townships in a scattered manner.
    Relying on the leadership of the rural Party branches to lead the masses to establish and run cooperatives is a working method that must be adopted in large-scale mass movements. However, the leadership level and working ability of rural Party branches are different. According to the statistics of the CPC Qixian County Committee in Henan, among the 136 township Party branch secretaries in the county, only 57 can do the work of assessing the means of production. The other township branch secretaries and some cadres who are divorced from production can only publicize the Party's cooperative policy and do not know how to assess the means of production; adopting the method of convening cooperative establishment representative conferences based on small districts or joint townships can enable grassroots cadres to receive concrete help and guidance from the county and district Party committees and avoid detours in their work. Many grassroots cadres have learned many working methods after several cooperative establishment representative conferences.
    Because the cooperative establishment representative conference has the above two major advantages, and the conference adopts the method of checking the situation of each cooperative and solving problems by category, it can discover problems in a timely manner, correct deviations, and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies. Quanqiao Joint Township in Fangcheng County adopted this method and established 48 new cooperatives in October, and also developed 113 mutual aid groups. The quality of these newly established cooperatives is basically good, with 28 first-class cooperatives, 18 second-class cooperatives, and 2 third-class cooperatives. Among the 1,141 new cooperative members, except for 3 households who did not join voluntarily and 46 households who joined due to the trend, the rest joined consciously and voluntarily; in the handling of the means of production joining the cooperative, 37 cooperatives assessed them completely reasonably, and the remaining cooperatives achieved basic rationality; in the composition of the members and backbone of the cooperatives, poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants accounted for the vast majority, and among the 516 cadres above the level of cooperative affairs committee members, poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants accounted for 501, new and old upper-middle peasants accounted for 15, and most were Party members and cadres with higher ideological awareness. By the beginning of November, all the agricultural cooperatives in the joint township (28 old cooperatives originally) had universally established production teams, divided耕作区（plow districts), and actively launched production competitions.

    一个群众性建社的方法
    ——介绍方城、新郑等地的建社代表会议
    林洪
    河南很多县都是经过秋收前后的一个浪潮，在大约二十天到一个月内，就建立了数百个甚至上千个农业合作社；在一个乡的范围内，同时在着手建立的农业合作社往往有十个、八个，甚至十几个。针对这种情况，新郑和方城等县采取了以小区或联乡为单位，召开建社代表会议的办法。事实证明，这种召开建社代表会议是党组织，特别是县、区党委领导群众性建社和扩社的好办法。
    这种建社代表会（有的地方也叫互助合作代表会），是在区委或联乡（即中心乡）工作队的直接领导下召开的，参加会议的是各乡的党支部和团支部的领导干部、合作社的社长、正在筹备建社的贫农积极分子。一般是根据建社运动的四个不同阶段举行四次会议。第一次建社代表会在建社运动的初期召开，主要解决建社的思想发动工作和贯彻执行阶级路线的问题。第二次会议在建社运动进入评定生产资料阶段的时候召开，主要是检查前一阶段的工作情况，解决在评定生产资料中如何认真地贯彻执行自愿互利政策的问题。第三次会议是在评定生产资料工作基本结束、进入选举社干部的阶段召开，除了研究如何进一步贯彻执行自愿互利政策，检查纠正评定生产资料工作中的偏差以外，着重研究怎样选好社干部、健全社的领导和建立社内的各项制度。第四次会议是在建社工作基本结束的情况下召开的。这次会议的内容，除了检查总结整个建社工作和解决遗留问题以外，还研究了建立和健全新社的生产管理和财务管理特别是安排生产的问题。因为在一个地区内，建社、扩社和整顿老社常常同时进行，而整顿老社的内容基本上是和新建社相同的，所以在每次会议上都穿插研究整顿老社的问题。
    在这些会议上，一般先由区委或联乡工作队长作报告，肯定一个时期的工作成绩，指出今后需要解决的问题；然后分乡或分组进行讨论，逐社逐户地查情况，摆问题，参考有关的文件和交流介绍经验。例如，方城县券桥联乡（包括六个乡）召开第一次建社代表会议时，发现不少党员、干部和积极分子的工作不深入，错误地认为群众的劲头大，用不着再进行思想工作。区干部赵长贵说：“不发动群众，入社的户就够啦！还用发动群众！”因而党员、干部对各阶层群众的思想动态和工作基础缺乏具体的了解，不摸运动的底。同时各乡还出现了排斥贫农、强拉中农入社的现象。在出席会议的六十四个代表中，对依靠贫农口通心不通的就有三十八人。有八个代表这样说：“建社是贫农骨头中农肉，贫农没牲口，光靠贫农建不成社。”对阶级敌人的破坏活动也缺乏警惕，认为群众行动起来了，敌人“老实”了。因此，在这次建社代表会议上，联乡工作队便组织到会的代表再次学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”报告的第四、第五部分，结合实际事例批判了右倾思想和不深入的工作作风。会上介绍了土山乡党支部书记翟书保办社失败的例子。一九五四年秋天建社的时候，翟书保离开了自己领导的贫农互助组，去领导胡学忠等富裕中农的互助组转社。由于胡学忠等富裕农民不是真心入社，经常在社内闹纠纷，社就无法巩固下去，只好又转成互助组。运用这种理论联系实际的方法，使到会代表进一步懂得了在建社中必须正确执行党的阶级政策，做好思想发动工作和新社员的审查工作。然后大家便逐社展开了三查：查各阶层的思想动态，查社员的成份，查入社的思想动机。最后由联乡工作队逐社审批社的成员。这样，就保证了社的质量。
    会议的内容和开法，不是一成不变的，可以根据当地的情况来决定。例如，新郑县薛店区是以小区为单位召开建社代表会，而这个区的各乡都是分成先后两批建社。因此，在召开第二次建社代表会时，小区负责同志报告工作以后，老社和基本结束评定生产资料工作的社着重检查评定生产资料工作中是否正确地执行了互利政策，评定后是否组织了生产；正在建立的社和正在筹备建社的贫农积极分子，着重研究吸收哪些人入社的问题。为了帮助大家正确领会互利政策和评定生产资料的方法，还组织了几个典型社介绍了这方面的经验。最后由小区负责同志进行总结，提出问题，肯定办法。这样作，大家都感到很满意，反映说：“真解决问题”；“开多天的会都不如这一天，这真比照书本学政策的办法强得多”。
    由于建社工作比较紧张，运动发展得很快，建社代表会议不应开得过长，一般以一天到两天的时间为适宜。在这样短促的时间内，要把会议开好，真正达到查明情况、解决问题的目的，区委或联乡工作队必须做好以下几件工作：首先，必须在事前对自己地区合作化运动的情况有个比较详细的了解，分析提出当前最主要的问题，明确会议的内容。只有认真地做好了这项工作，才能在会议开始以后，就引导到会代表围绕着中心议题讨论、发言；才能在会前就研究出解决问题的办法，使会议上提出来的问题得到及时的正确的解决。要在事前就了解到情况，可以采取驻各乡的工作队员和区干部提前半天回联乡和区汇报，或召开各乡党支部书记汇报会议的办法。其次，必须事前准备好典型发言。区委或联乡工作队应深入下去了解情况，发现带有普遍性的问题。这样，才能使领导真正做到心中有数，更好地选择和培养典型发言，以具体指导运动。在券桥联乡召开的第二次建社代表会上，由联乡工作队长介绍了联乡一社在土地评产中发生的问题及其解决的办法，对到会代表的教育很大；有的乡原来三天都没有把土地产量评好，会后，很快把问题解决了。最后，会议的成员要确定得适当，特别是贫农积极分子和乡的主要干部必须参加。这样，乡干部和积极分子回乡后，马上就可以开始工作，以免层层传达决议、指示，拖长时间，影响工作。
    采取建社代表会的办法来领导建社工作，首先是解决了干部少而弱的问题，使领导能够走在群众运动的前面，及时指导运动。例如，方城县的券桥联乡共有六个乡，而联乡工作队在乡工作的实际只有七人，除一个乡驻两个工作人员外，其余五个乡只能驻一个工作人员。当时，这个联乡除建社是中心工作以外，还有生产、秋征、整党、整社等多项任务，驻乡工作队员就不能用全部力量来指导建社工作；而且他们中间也还有两个人没有做过农村工作，两个人不大会做建社工作。这个联乡采用建社代表会议以后，不但及时地系统地了解到运动进行的情况，而且用干部和群众的集体智慧来指导整个建社工作，从而有效地解决了干部少而弱和工作任务多的矛盾。对县委的领导来说，如果全县都采取建社代表会的方法，由县委委员或县的主要干部分头指导各区或各中心乡开好这种会议，这也比县委分散地抓区或抓乡，能够更加及时、全面和具体地了解情况。
    依靠乡村党支部领导群众建社和办社，这是在大规模的群众运动中必须采用的工作方法。但是，农村党支部的领导水平和工作能力是不一样的。据中共河南杞县县委的统计，在全县一百三十六个乡党支部书记中，会作评定生产资料工作的只有五十七个，其他的乡支部书记和部分脱离生产干部，只会宣传党的合作化政策，还不会评定生产资料；而采取以小区或联乡为单位，召开建社代表会的方法，就可以使基层干部得到县、区党委的具体帮助和指导，避免在工作中走弯路。许多基层干部，经过几次建社代表会，就学到了很多工作方法。
    由于建社代表会有上述的两大优点，而且会议采取了逐社查情况和分类解决问题的方法，因而能够及时地发现问题，纠正偏差，保证党的政策的正确贯彻执行。方城县券桥联乡采用这种方法，在十月份建立了新社四十八个，同时还发展了互助组一百一十三个。这批新建社的质量基本上是好的，其中一类社二十八个，二类社十八个，三类社两个。在一千一百四十一户新社员中，除三户入社不自愿，四十六户是随大流入社的外，其余都是自觉自愿入社的；在入社的生产资料的处理上，评定得完全合理的有三十七个社，其余的社做到了基本合理；在社的成员和骨干的成份上，贫农和新老下中农占绝大多数，五百一十六个社务委员以上的干部中，贫农和新老下中农五百零一人，新老上中农十五人，多数是思想觉悟较高的党员、干部。到十一月初旬，全联乡所有的农业合作社（原有老社二十八个）都普遍地建立了生产队，划分了耕作区，积极地展开了生产竞赛。
