    Where Should Agricultural Machinery Stations Be Located?
    Shang Kai
    With the great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, some counties and cities have begun to establish agricultural machinery stations in a focused manner. However, where should agricultural machinery stations be located? This is still a new topic.
    What criteria should be used to select the site for an agricultural machinery station? Judging from the past experience of establishing agricultural machinery stations in a few areas, there seems to be a convention: that is, to choose agricultural machinery stations in villages with famous agricultural labor models or advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The agricultural machinery station in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, is located in Zhangqing Township, the location of the county's most advanced Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative. The agricultural machinery station in Linyi County is located in Quandu Township, the location of the county's most advanced Quandu Agricultural Production Cooperative. Not long ago, when Jieyu County was conducting a comprehensive plan for agricultural mechanization, it also followed this convention and prepared to move an existing agricultural machinery station to Jinjingmiao and set up an agricultural machinery station to be established in Wangcun Township, because there are more advanced agricultural production cooperatives there. But these villages are relatively remote places. In the past, when the agricultural cooperativization movement had not fully unfolded, it was of course necessary to temporarily place agricultural machinery stations in some advanced large societies for the convenience of mechanized farming; however, today, when many areas have basically completed semi-socialist cooperativization, and large tracts of land are connected everywhere, providing very convenient conditions for mechanized farming, if we still follow the past convention and insist on choosing the site of the agricultural machinery station in the place where the advanced agricultural production cooperative is located, regardless of the conditions there, it is obviously wrong.
    In the case of the great development of the cooperative movement, the site of the agricultural machinery station should be chosen in a place that is both the political and economic center and has convenient transportation. Because, first, the agricultural machinery station is an important stronghold for the state to lead agricultural production cooperatives. It not only helps farmers materially, but also has a huge impact on changing farmers' selfish and conservative mentality and habits. The Party organization must firmly grasp it in its own hands. Second, the agricultural machinery station itself is a production leadership agency, a command post, which should make full use of modern transportation and communication equipment to command the cultivation of a dozen or even dozens of tractor teams.
    Recently, Soviet agricultural expert Comrade Trosov came to Jieyu County and said after seeing Jieyu County’s preliminary plan for agricultural mechanization: "Now there are still few advanced agricultural production cooperatives in your county, and agricultural machinery stations can still follow them; in the future, when hundreds of cooperatives in the county have become advanced cooperatives, then your agricultural machinery stations will have to be busy moving every day!" According to the expert's suggestion, Jieyu County changed its original plan and re-determined the addresses of the two agricultural machinery stations: one is located in Chengguan Town, which is in the eastern part of the county; the other is located in Yuxiang Town, which is in the western part of the county. Each station has twelve mechanized farming teams. In this way, the entire county forms two semi-circular tractor networks with Chengguan Town and Yuxiang Town as the center.

    农业机器站应当选择在什么地方
    商恺
    随着农业合作化运动的大发展，有些县、市已经开始有重点地建立农业机器站。但是，农业机器站应当选择在什么地点？这还是一个新的课题。
    应当根据什么标准来选择农业机器站的站址呢？从过去少数地区建立农业机器站的情况来看，好像有这样一种惯例：就是把农业机器站选择在有著名的农业劳动模范或先进的农业生产合作社的村子里。山西省榆次县的农业机器站，就设置在全县最先进的曙光农业生产合作社的所在地——张庆乡。临猗县的农业机器站设置在全县最先进的泉杜农业生产合作社的所在地——泉杜乡。不久以前，解虞县在进行农业机械化的全面规划的时候，也因袭这种惯例，准备把现有的一个农业机器站搬到金井庙，把即将建立的一个农业机器站安设在王村乡，因为那里有比较先进的农业生产合作社。但是这些乡村都是比较偏僻的地方。如果是在过去，农业合作化运动没有全面展开，从便利机耕出发，把农业机器站临时安置在一些先进的大社所在的地方，当然是必要的；但是，在今天许多地区已经基本上完成了半社会主义合作化，到处都是阡陌相连的大片土地，给机耕提供了非常便利的条件，如果仍旧沿袭过去的惯例，一定要把农业机器站的站址选择到先进农业生产合作社所在的地方，而不管那里的条件如何，显然，这就是错误的了。
    在合作化运动大发展的情况下，应当把农业机器站的站址选择到政治、经济的中心又是交通便利的地方。因为，第一，农业机器站是国家领导农业生产合作社的重要据点，它不仅是从物质上帮助农民，而且对改变农民的自私保守的心理和习惯，也有巨大的作用。党组织必须把它紧紧地掌握在自己的手里。第二，农业机器站本身是一个生产领导机关，是一个指挥部，它要尽量利用现代化的交通通讯设备，指挥十几个甚至几十个拖拉机队的耕作。
    最近，苏联农业专家特洛索夫同志到解虞县一趟，他看了解虞县关于农业机械化的初步规划以后说：“现在你们县里先进的农业生产合作社还少，农业机器站还可以跟着它们跑；将来，全县几百个合作社都变成了先进的合作社，那时候，你们的农业机器站就要天天忙着搬家哩！”解虞县根据专家的建议，改变了原来的计划，重新决定了两个农业机器站的地址：一个设在城关镇，它在县的偏东部；一个设在虞乡镇，在县的偏西部。两站各设十二个机耕队。这样，全县便以城关镇和虞乡镇为中心形成了两个半圆形的拖拉机网。
