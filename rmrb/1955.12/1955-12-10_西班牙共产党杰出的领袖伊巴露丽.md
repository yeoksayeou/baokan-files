    Outstanding Leader of the Communist Party of Spain, Ibarruri

    December 9th of this year is the sixtieth birthday of Comrade Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain. The working classes and peace-loving democrats of all countries in the world join the Spanish people in congratulating this outstanding leader of the Spanish working class and people on her birthday, and in celebrating the glorious achievements she has made in nearly forty years of revolutionary struggle.

    Ibárruri was born into a Spanish miner's family. From her youth, she became a member of the Spanish working class and actively participated in their struggles. In order to liberate the working class from capitalist enslavement, to establish a democratic regime in Spain and to restore national independence, Ibárruri has always worked tirelessly with the Spanish Communists to lead the Spanish working people and patriots in persistent struggles. Ibárruri's voice has become the hope of the Spanish people in the dark days of cruel oppression by the fascist forces and a beacon to inspire them to move forward.

    In the early struggles of the Spanish people to destroy the decaying foundations of the semi-feudal monarchy, Ibárruri began to form her political character as a Communist. She realized from the struggle that the main shortcomings of this anti-feudal struggle lay in the lack of a true revolutionary political direction and the lack of unity between the working class and democratic forces.

    In 1917, the first socialist country unprecedented in human history was born. Ibárruri had boundless love for the cause of the October Revolution, and she was a loyal defender of the newborn Soviet regime. From the beginning, she placed herself at the forefront of the international working-class struggle. She was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Spain.

    In the early 1930s, Ibárruri had become a leader of the Communist Party of Spain. At that time, Spain was experiencing a revolutionary crisis to overthrow the monarchy, but the party was still a small force at this time, and it was also eroded by sectarianism and opportunists. In order to establish the party's political line, eliminate harmful elements within the party, and especially to determine the party's practical action guidelines that are adapted to the rapid development of the Spanish democratic revolution, Ibárruri, together with José Díaz, carried out an irreconcilable struggle, making the party a true Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism, taking on the responsibility of the vanguard of the Spanish revolutionary masses.

    As fascist forces rose in Spain, Spanish democracy faced a grave danger. As a great anti-fascist fighter, Ibárruri resolutely defended the unity of the working class and all democratic forces in order to fight against the fascist forces. She tirelessly defended and supported the unity of the Popular Front embodied in the victory of the 1936 elections, and strived to expand the democratic union formed in the struggle against fascism and in defense of the democratic republic. In July 1936, the Franco fascist forces, supported by Hitler and Mussolini, launched a frenzied attack on the Republic. Ibárruri, together with José Díaz and the Central Committee of the Party, mobilized and led the Spanish people in a heroic battle against the fascist rebellion. Ibárruri participated in all work for victory on the front lines and in the rear.

    After three years of heroic struggle, the Spanish people finally failed to contain Franco, who was supported by international fascist forces, from establishing a dictatorial regime of terror. In this situation, the Spanish Communists did not hesitate to decide on their new task: they must continue to fight under new conditions, they must maintain the confidence and hope of all the Spanish people for the future, and they must reorganize the party's forces. After 1939, although Ibárruri was forced into exile abroad, she still dedicated all her strength to this new task.

    Since the death of José Díaz, Ibárruri has served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain. As an excellent student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Ibárruri has made valuable theoretical contributions to the Spanish revolutionary movement. Ibárruri constantly pointed out to the Spanish Communists and patriots the characteristics of the domestic and international situation in Spain, and criticized the anarchist and reformist influences within the working class. She repeatedly emphasized the party's policy in the face of new historical tasks: the policy of unity, the policy of concentrating all forces against the Franco regime, the policy of uniting all democrats and patriots into a national anti-Franco front on the basis of a common action program, in order to overthrow the Franco regime and rebuild democracy in Spain.

    At the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of Spain held in 1954, Ibárruri, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, stipulated the Party's position on all major issues in the country, and brilliantly depicted the victorious future of revolutionary development. Regarding the military treaty signed between the United States and Spain, she pointed out that Spain had lost its national sovereignty and had become a vassal of the United States. The US-Franco treaty is a war treaty, and this treaty is anti-national. The interests of the Spanish people are complete national independence, peace, and peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems. She also pointed out that the political activism that cannot be blocked by fascist terror has emerged among the working class and the masses of the Spanish people today, the idea of ​​changing the status quo has formed in all aspects of Spanish society, and a new anti-Franco force is accumulating, this force is opening a period of democratic reform for Spain. At the same time, she warned that fascism would not die on its own, and the party must strengthen the fighting power of the masses of the people in all aspects in order to finally destroy the fascist system.

    The reality of the situation in Spain proves the correctness of Ibárruri's instructions. The awakening of the working people is growing, their unity with other social strata is strengthening, the concerted action of various forces against the Franco fascist regime is developing, and the movement of the entire Spanish people against the United States making Spain a vassal is expanding. The united forces of the Spanish people are firmly moving towards the decisive goal of overthrowing the Franco fascist rule and establishing an independent and democratic Spain.

    In her long revolutionary struggle, Ibárruri has selflessly dedicated herself to the cause of the liberation of the working class. Her life is an example of loyalty to the cause of socialist revolution, loyalty to proletarian internationalism, and loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. This revolutionary spirit of Ibárruri not only wins the boundless love of the Spanish working class and all patriotic people, making her the most beloved leader of the Spanish people; but also is respected and admired by the working people of all countries in the world.

    西班牙共产党杰出的领袖伊巴露丽
    今年十二月九日是西班牙共产党中央委员会总书记多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽同志的六十岁寿辰。全世界各国的工人阶级和和平民主人士都和西班牙人民一起祝贺这一位杰出的西班牙工人阶级和人民的领袖的生日，祝贺她在将近四十年的革命斗争中立下的光辉的功绩。
    伊巴露丽出身于西班牙一个矿工的家庭。她从青年时代起就成为西班牙工人阶级的一员，并积极地参与了他们的斗争。为了使工人阶级从资本主义的奴役下解放出来，为了在西班牙建立民主政权和恢复民族独立，伊巴露丽始终不懈地同西班牙共产党人一起领导着西班牙劳动人民和爱国者进行了坚持的斗争。伊巴露丽的声音已成为西班牙人民在法西斯势力残酷压迫的黑暗的日子里对于胜利的希望和鼓舞他们前进的灯塔。
    在早期的西班牙人民摧毁半封建的君主制度的腐朽基础的斗争中，伊巴露丽开始形成了作为共产党员的政治品格。她从斗争中认识到这一反封建斗争的主要缺点在于缺乏真正的革命的政治方向，缺乏工人阶级和民主力量的团结。
    一九一七年，人类的前所未有的第一个社会主义国家诞生了。伊巴露丽对十月革命的事业抱有无限的热爱，她是新生的苏维埃政权的忠诚的保卫者。从一开始她就置身于国际工人阶级斗争的最前列。她是西班牙共产党的创始人之一。
    在三十年代初期，伊巴露丽已成为西班牙共产党的领袖。那时西班牙正经历着推翻君主政体的革命危机，但是党在这时还是一支很小的力量，而且还受到宗派主义者和机会主义者的侵蚀。为了确立党的政治路线，清除党内的有害成份，特别是为了确定同西班牙民主革命迅速发展相适应的党的实际行动的方针，伊巴露丽同何塞·迪亚斯一起，进行了不调和的斗争，使得党成为真正的以马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党，负起西班牙革命群众先锋队的责任。
    随着法西斯主义势力在西班牙上升，西班牙的民主面临了严重的危险。作为一个伟大的反法西斯战士，伊巴露丽坚决地维护工人阶级和一切民主力量的团结，以便同法西斯势力作斗争。她不倦地维护并支持了体现在一九三六年选举中胜利的人民战线的团结，为扩大在反法西斯主义和保卫民主共和国斗争中结成的民主联合而努力。一九三六年七月，佛朗哥法西斯势力在希特勒和墨索里尼支持下向共和国发动了疯狂的进攻。伊巴露丽和何塞·迪亚斯及党中央在一起，动员和领导着西班牙人民进行了反抗法西斯叛乱的英勇战斗。伊巴露丽在前线和后方参加了一切为了争取胜利的工作。
    经过了三年的英勇斗争之后，西班牙人民终于没有能够遏止得到国际法西斯主义势力支持的佛朗哥建立恐怖的独裁政权。西班牙共产党人在这种情况下毫不犹豫地决定了自己的新的任务：必须在新的条件下继续战斗，必须使全西班牙人民保持对未来的信心和希望，必须重新组织党的力量。在一九三九年后，伊巴露丽虽然被迫流亡国外，但是她仍然把全部力量献给这个新的任务。
    自从何塞·迪亚斯逝世以后，伊巴露丽就担任了西班牙共产党总书记的职务。作为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的优秀学生，伊巴露丽对西班牙的革命运动作了宝贵的理论上的贡献。伊巴露丽不断地对西班牙共产党人和爱国者指出西班牙国内和国际形势的特点，批判工人阶级内部的无政府主义和改良主义的影响。她一再地强调说明党在新的历史任务面前的政策：关于团结的政策，关于集中一切力量反对佛朗哥政权的政策，关于在共同行动纲领的基础上把一切民主人士和爱国者团结成一个全民的反佛朗哥阵线，以推翻佛朗哥政权，在西班牙重建民主的政策。
    在一九五四年举行的西班牙共产党第五次代表大会上，伊巴露丽代表党的中央，规定了党在全国一切重大问题上的地位，并英明地描绘了革命发展的胜利前途。她并就美国和西班牙签订的军事条约指出：西班牙已丧失了民族主权，成为美国的附庸。美国—佛朗哥条约是一个战争条约，这个条约是反民族的。西班牙人民的利益是完全的民族独立、和平和不同社会和政治制度国家的和平共处。她还指出，在今天的西班牙工人阶级和人民群众中已经出现了法西斯恐怖所阻挡不了的政治积极性，必须改变现状的思想在西班牙社会的各方面形成起来了，一股新的反对佛朗哥的力量正在积聚中，这个力量正在为西班牙打开一个民主改革的时期。同时，她警告说，法西斯主义不会自行灭亡，党必须从各方面加强人民群众的战斗力，才能最后摧毁法西斯制度。
    西班牙的现实局势证明了伊巴露丽指示的正确。工农劳动群众的觉醒在增长，他们和其他社会阶层的团结在加强，各种反佛朗哥法西斯政权的力量的一致行动在发展，全体西班牙人民反对美国使西班牙成为附庸的运动在扩大。西班牙人民的联合力量正在坚定地走向推翻佛朗哥法西斯统治和建立一个独立民主的西班牙这个有决定意义的目标。
    伊巴露丽在她长期的革命斗争中，无私地献身于工人阶级解放的事业。她的一生是忠实于社会主义革命事业、忠实于无产阶级国际主义、忠实于马克思列宁主义原则的范例。伊巴露丽的这种革命精神，不仅获得西班牙工人阶级和全体爱国人民的无限的热爱，使她成为西班牙人民的最爱戴的领袖；而且受到全世界各国劳动人民的尊敬和钦佩。
