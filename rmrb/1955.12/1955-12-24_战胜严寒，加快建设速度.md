    Overcoming the Severe Cold, Accelerating Construction Speed
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    More than 40,000 basic construction workers in the Xi'an area began intensive winter construction on December 16th. The area under winter construction covers hundreds of thousands of square meters. There are many winter construction projects, including factories, schools, office buildings, and dormitories. Due to the implementation of winter construction, many projects have started ahead of schedule, some originally scheduled to start next year have started this year, and some originally scheduled to be completed next year will be completed this year.
    On the construction sites in the suburbs of Xi'an, things appear even more active than usual. Basic construction workers are entering the construction area with great enthusiasm. Here, you can see metal structure workers working at a height of 36 meters, bulldozer operators carrying out earthwork with large bulldozers, and bricklayers hidden on scaffolding protected by straw mats building walls... They are all working actively in the severe cold to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    On the construction site of the First Engineering Area of the Northwest First Engineering Company, concrete workers are pouring a very important foundation. According to the workers, this is a vital project, and the quality must be 100% guaranteed. To achieve this, the workers proposed many guarantees, such as the "fast mixing, fast transportation, fast compaction, and fast insulation" proposed by the Wang Dezhi Youth Shock Brigade. Standing on the construction site, you can see them earnestly implementing these guarantees. The workers mixing concrete are very skillfully loading stones, sand, and cement into the mixer. The workers transporting concrete are pushing dump trucks full of concrete towards the foundation project. The workers responsible for compaction are using vibrators to compact the concrete intensively. The workers responsible for insulation are busily tying insulating straw and skillfully opening the steam pipe switch, so the heat is like white mist filling the foundation project. These processes are organized like a precise machine. Other engineering personnel are the same. The staff of the materials testing station have calculated in advance the detailed concrete temperatures to be used at different temperatures and listed them in a table so that the concrete temperature can be changed in time when the temperature rises or falls.
    On other construction sites, basic construction workers are also demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm for labor to accelerate the speed of construction. Workers from the Second Earthwork Team of the Third Mechanical Construction Company, who came from the Northeast, are still braving the cold to drive excavators for earth excavation. Workers in the Northwest Metal Structure Factory have adopted advanced assembly line operation methods in winter construction. Assembly workers first assemble the steel frame, and then the welders weld it. When the welders are about to complete their work, the crane operators come over to manipulate the heavy crane to lift the huge steel frame into the air, and finally, the assembly workers and welders assemble and weld it together. Each link is tightly connected, and the various types of work are coordinated very well.
    The staff and workers on various construction sites of the Northwest Second Engineering Company raised slogans such as "What are we afraid of in the freezing weather for the sake of early industrialization?" "No matter how cold it is, it cannot cool our hearts to build socialism; no matter how hard it is, it is not as hard as the border guards defending the country." This expresses the determination to carry out winter construction. The workers in the Wang Zhixiang team of the Third Engineering Area all came from Shanghai. Their contract with the company signed in November this year has expired. Later, when they heard about winter construction, they signed another contract with the company. Zhang Shuyan, an ordinary worker in the Fourth Engineering Area, refused to go home to get married even when his father urged him to. This is because he deeply knows the importance of winter construction in accelerating the speed of construction.

### 战胜严寒，加快建设速度

    战胜严寒，加快建设速度
    本报记者　朱波
    西安地区的四万多基本建设工人，从本月十六日起，开始了紧张的冬季施工。进行冬季施工的面积有几十万平方公尺。冬季施工的项目繁多，有厂房、学校、办公楼、宿舍等。由于实行冬季施工，很多工程项目都提前动工了，有的原定明年开工的提前到今年开工，有的原定明年竣工的工程提前在今年竣工。
    在西安郊区的各个工地上，显得比往常还要活跃。基本建设工人们都精神饱满地进入施工区。在这里，可以看到在三十六公尺的高空进行作业的金属结构工人，看到开着大型推土机进行土方工程的掘土机手，和藏在用席子掩护起来的脚手架上砌墙的瓦工们……他们都在冒着寒冷，为提前完成五年计划而积极工作。
    西北第一工程公司一工区工地上，混凝土工人正在浇灌一个很重要的基础。按工人的说法，这是一个心脏工程，要百分之百地保证质量。为了达到这一点，工人提出了很多保证条件，如王德智青年突击队的工人提出“快拌、快运、快捣固、快保温”等四条保证。在工地上一站，就可以看到他们正认真地执行这些保证条件。搅拌混凝土的工人，非常熟练地向搅拌机里装石子、砂和水泥，运混凝土的工人推着装满混凝土的斗车跑向基础工程，负责捣固的工人拿着震动器紧张地进行捣固，负责保温的工人紧张地扎着保温的稻草，并且熟练地打开蒸气管的开关，热气像白色的云雾一般弥漫在基础工程上。这一个一个的工序，组织得就像一部精密的机器一样。其它工程人员也是一样，材料试验站的工作人员，事先就把不同气温下所采用的混凝土的温度详细地计算出来，列成表格，以便在气温升高或下降的时候及时地改变混凝土的温度。
    在其它工地上，基本建设工人为加速建设速度，也都发挥了高度的劳动热情。从东北来的第三机械施工公司第二土方队的工人，现在还冒着寒冷，驾驶掘土机进行掘土。西北金属结构厂的工人，在冬季施工中采用了先进的流水作业法，装配工首先装配钢铁架，电焊工接着焊接，等电焊工将要完工的时候，起重工人操纵重型起重机过来了，把巨大的钢铁架吊到高空，最后再由装配工和电焊工进行装配和焊接。每一个环节都扣得很紧，各个工种之间也配合得很协调。
    西北第二工程公司各个工地上的职工们，提出
  “为了早日工业化，天寒地冻怕什么？”“再冷，也冷不了我们建设社会主义的心；再苦，也苦不过保卫祖国建设的边防军”等口号。表示冬季施工的决心，第三工区王志祥小组的工人都是从上海来的，今年十一月份同公司签定的合同到期了，后来听说进行冬季施工，就又同公司签定了合同。四工区的普通工张树言，父亲督促他回家结婚，他拒绝了。因为他深切地知道冬季施工对加快建设速度的重要意义。
