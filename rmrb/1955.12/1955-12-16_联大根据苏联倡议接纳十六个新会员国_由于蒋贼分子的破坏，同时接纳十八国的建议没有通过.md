    Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, TASS, New York, December 15th: The United Nations Security Council, based on the Soviet delegation's initiative of December 14th, passed a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union, recommending that the General Assembly admit sixteen countries to the United Nations. These countries are: Albania, Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal, Libya, Cambodia, Laos, and Spain.
    The United Nations General Assembly, following the Security Council, held a plenary session on the same day and, based on the Security Council's recommendation, passed a resolution admitting the aforementioned sixteen countries as members of the United Nations. Thus, the number of United Nations member states increased to seventy-six. Representatives of the newly joined countries have already attended the meetings of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Xinhua News Agency reports: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on December 10th to examine the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations.
    Before the Security Council meeting, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang representatives attempted to obstruct a positive resolution on the issue of admitting eighteen countries simultaneously to the United Nations. He put forward thirteen proposals, demanding that only thirteen countries, including South Vietnam and South Korea, be admitted.
    Soviet representative Sobolev said that the General Assembly's call for admitting eighteen countries to the United Nations must be fully supported by the Security Council.
    Sobolev said that the main task now is to ensure the necessary votes in the Security Council and the General Assembly to guarantee the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries.
    Sobolev put forward corresponding proposals regarding the voting procedure and also put forward many proposals regarding the admission of eighteen countries to the United Nations.
    U.S. representative Lodge then spoke. He opposed the admission of five People's Democratic countries to the United Nations. Lodge also said that the United States believes that South Vietnam and South Korea "meet the necessary conditions for participating in the United Nations."
    Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, New York news: The United Nations Security Council continued to discuss the issue of admitting eighteen countries to the United Nations on the 13th.
    At the morning meeting, the Security Council passed the Brazil-New Zealand proposal by a majority vote. This proposal stipulated that the Security Council should first vote on each of the eighteen countries' applications to join the United Nations individually, and then vote on the Security Council's recommendation to the General Assembly regarding the admission of all those countries that have been approved.
    At this meeting, the Chiang Kai-shek elements' suggestion to admit South Korea and South Vietnam to the United Nations was rejected because the representative of the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council, cast a veto.
    The Security Council then voted on the eighteen countries' applications in the order in which they applied.
    The Security Council smoothly passed the admission of the first country on the list—the People's Republic of Albania—to the United Nations.
    Next, when the application of the Mongolian People's Republic was voted on, the Chiang Kai-shek elements brazenly disregarded the recommendation of the United Nations General Assembly and cast a veto.
    After the Chiang Kai-shek elements adopted this shameless obstructionist tactic, the Soviet representative, upholding the United Nations General Assembly's recommendation on the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries, and proceeding from the Soviet Union's consistent position, vetoed the applications of thirteen countries—Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal, Libya, Cambodia, Japan, Laos, and Spain—in the subsequent sixteen votes, rejecting these applications.
    Security Council President Munro then put to a vote the recommendation to the General Assembly to admit Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, which had already been approved by the Security Council. As a result, the Chiang Kai-shek elements cast another veto, while the United States, Britain, and other Western countries deliberately abstained, resulting in the rejection of their applications.
    Thus, due to the sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek elements, the Security Council was unable to make the corresponding decision on the United Nations General Assembly's recommendation on the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries, which the people of the world had long been awaiting.
    In explaining the reasons for his vote, Soviet representative Sobolev asked the Security Council to carefully consider the situation: a Chiang Kai-shek element who can only represent himself can violate the will of the United Nations General Assembly and the will of the majority of Security Council members. Sobolev emphasized that international public opinion will conclude that the United States should be held responsible for the actions of the Chiang Kai-shek elements and the situation it has created. In refuting Lodge's remarks, Sobolev pointed out that it is not the Soviet Union but the United States that is showing an irreconcilable attitude. The United States has consistently obstructed the admission of countries whose political systems it dislikes to the United Nations.

    联大根据苏联倡议接纳十六个新会员国
    由于蒋贼分子的破坏，同时接纳十八国的建议没有通过
    新华社十五日讯　塔斯社纽约十五日讯：联合国安全理事会根据苏联代表团十二月十四日的倡议，通过了苏联提出的一个提案，建议大会接纳十六个国家加入联合国。这些国家是：阿尔巴尼亚、约旦、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、匈牙利、意大利、奥地利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、利比亚、柬埔寨、老挝和西班牙。
    联合国大会同一天接着举行全体会议，根据安全理事会的推荐，通过了接纳上述十六个国家为联合国会员国的决议。这样，联合国会员国就增加到七十六个。新参加联合国的国家的代表已经出席联合国大会的会议。
    据新华社讯　联合国安全理事会十二月十日举行会议，审议接纳新会员国加入联合国的问题。
    在安全理事会举行会议以前，蒋介石匪帮代表企图阻挠关于接纳十八个国家同时加入联合国的问题取得积极的解决，他提出了十三项提案，要求只接纳包括南越和南朝鲜在内的十三个国家。
    苏联代表索波列夫说，大会关于接纳十八个国家加入联合国的呼吁必须得到安全理事会的充分支持。
    索波列夫说，现在主要的任务是保证在安全理事会和大会中的必要票数，以便保证同时接纳十八个国家。
    索波列夫就表决程序提出了相应的提案，并且提出了关于接纳十八个国家加入联合国的许多项提案。
    美国代表洛奇接着发言。他反对接纳五个人民民主国家加入联合国。洛奇还说，美国认为南越和南朝鲜“符合参加联合国所必要的条件”。
    据新华社十五日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会十三日继续讨论接纳十八个国家加入联合国的问题。
    在上午会议上，安全理事会以多数票通过了巴西—新西兰的提案，这个提案规定安全理事会应当首先就十八个国家要求加入联合国的申请逐一进行表决，然后再表决安全理事会关于接纳那些已经得到赞同的国家全部加入联合国给大会的建议。
    在这次会议上，蒋介石分子提出的要求接纳南朝鲜和南越加入联合国的建议被否决，因为安全理事会常任理事国苏联的代表投了反对票。
    安全理事会接着就按照十八个国家申请加入联合国的先后次序逐个进行表决。
    安全理事会顺利地通过了接纳在名单上的第一个国家——阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国加入联合国。
    接着，就对蒙古人民共和国的申请进行表决，然而，蒋介石分子这时竟悍然不顾联合国大会的建议投了否决票。
    在蒋介石分子采取了这种无耻的阻挠手段以后，拥护联合国大会关于同时接纳十八个国家加入联合国的建议的苏联代表，从苏联一贯坚持的立场出发，在以后进行的十六次表决中，对约旦、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、意大利、奥地利、芬兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、利比亚、柬埔寨、日本、老挝和西班牙等十三国的申请投了反对票，否决了这些申请。
    安全理事会主席孟罗接着把推荐大会接纳已经获得安全理事会赞同的阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利四国的建议提付表决，结果，蒋介石分子又投了反对票，而美英等西方国家故意弃权，结果拒绝了它们的申请。
    这样，由于蒋介石分子的破坏，安全理事会就没有能就联合国大会关于同时接纳十八个国家的建议作出全世界人民久已期待的相应决定。
    苏联代表索波列夫在说明投票理由的时候，要求安全理事会很好地考虑这种情况：一个只能代表他自己的蒋介石分子竟可以违反联合国大会的意志和安全理事会大多数理事国的意志。索波列夫着重指出，国际舆论将会得出结论：美国应当对蒋介石分子的行动和它造成的局面负责。索波列夫在驳斥洛奇的论调的时候指出，表现不调和的态度的不是苏联而正是美国，美国一贯在阻挠那些政治制度为它不喜欢的国家加入联合国。
