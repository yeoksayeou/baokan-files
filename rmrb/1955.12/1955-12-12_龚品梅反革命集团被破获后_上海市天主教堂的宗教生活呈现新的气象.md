After the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was smashed in early September, the religious life in more than ten Catholic churches in Shanghai presented a new atmosphere.

In early October, these churches held a grand Mass ceremony to celebrate National Day. Many churches were decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and the five-star red flag fluttered over the churches. The Xuhui District Ignatius Church rang its bells for half an hour on the morning of October 1st. Some young people who had been deeply poisoned by Gong Pinmei also happily participated in the Catholic community's parade this year on National Day.

Now, believers will no longer be monitored and insulted by special believers with cloth wrapped around their arms when they go to church for Mass, and their legitimate religious life has been guaranteed. October 30th and November 1st are the Catholic "Christ the King" and "All Saints Day." Believers flocked to churches to attend Mass and pray. The Xuhui District Ignatius Church hung garlands, couplets and other decorations in the church to celebrate these two traditional festivals, and the pagoda lights illuminated the entire hall. Six or seven Masses were held every day. The Franciscan Church, Christ the King Church, Peter's Church, Joseph's Church, Sacred Heart Church and other churches in other districts also held grand ceremonial rituals on these two days. Luo Yuefang, a female Catholic who regularly attended Mass at the Yangjingbang Joseph's Church, was severely punished by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group for enthusiastically participating in community welfare work and for having a child in the Young Pioneers. She and her family were forbidden from receiving the "Holy Communion" for more than three years. Only after the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was smashed did she receive the "Holy Communion" from the priest at Joseph's Church. Pan Xuefang, the director of general affairs of the Sacred Heart Convent, a female Catholic in Xuhui District who was "excommunicated" by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, has now been granted permission by the priest to hold the "blessed marriage" ceremony on November 11th, which the church had refused to perform when she married last April. Patriotic Catholics in other districts who were persecuted by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group under the guise of divine authority have now truly regained their freedom of religious belief. Ma Jieli, an elderly Catholic in Xuhui District, said: "Our righteous act of patriotism has finally been vindicated."

### 龚品梅反革命集团被破获后  上海市天主教堂的宗教生活呈现新的气象

    龚品梅反革命集团被破获后
    上海市天主教堂的宗教生活呈现新的气象
    自从龚品梅反革命集团在九月上旬被破获以后，上海市十多个天主教堂的宗教生活呈现新的气象。
    十月初，这些教堂为庆祝国庆举行了一次规模盛大的弥撒礼节。许多教堂张灯结彩，在教堂上空飘起了五星红旗。徐汇区依纳爵堂在十月一日早晨鸣钟半小时。过去受龚品梅毒害很深的一部分青年，在今年国庆节也兴高采烈地参加了天主教界的游行队伍。
    现在，教徒们到教堂去望弥撒时也不会再受到臂上缠布的特殊教徒的监视和凌辱了，他们的正当的宗教生活已获得了保障。十月三十日、十一月一日是天主教的“耶稣君王”和“诸处瞻礼”的日子。教徒们络绎不绝地到教堂去望弥撒和祈祷。徐汇区依纳爵堂为了庆祝这两个传统的节日，在教堂里挂起了花冠、对联等装饰品，宝塔灯照得全堂通明，每天举行六、七台弥撒。其它区的方济各堂、君王堂、伯多禄堂、若瑟堂、圣心堂等在这两天中也都举行了大瞻礼仪式。一直在洋泾浜若瑟堂望弥撒的女教徒罗月芳，因为热心参加里弄的福利工作，又有一个孩子参加了少年先锋队，就受到了龚品梅反革命集团严厉的处罚，有三年多的时间不准她一家人领“圣体”。直到龚品梅反革命集团被破获以后，她才在若瑟堂的神父手里领到了“圣体”。遭到龚品梅反革命集团“绝罚”的徐汇区女教徒、圣母院总务主任潘雪芳现在已得到神父同意，在十一月十一日补行了她去年四月结婚时被教堂拒绝举行的“祝福婚配”仪式。其他各区遭到龚品梅反革命集团假借神权迫害的爱国天主教徒现在都真正恢复了宗教信仰的自由。徐汇区老年教徒马杰礼说：“我们爱国无罪的正义，现在终于获得伸张了。”
