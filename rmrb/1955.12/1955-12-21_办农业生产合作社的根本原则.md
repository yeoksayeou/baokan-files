(Explaining the Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives to Farmers)
Editor's Note: The Notice of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on the Issuance of the Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives points out that people's committees at all levels must conscientiously organize forces to explain this draft to all staff members in districts and townships and to members of local agricultural production cooperatives, and guide each cooperative to try it out. At the same time, appropriate measures should also be taken to explain this draft to farmers who have not joined the cooperatives, in order to carry out systematic propaganda and education on agricultural cooperation for them, and to listen to their opinions on this draft. In order to help staff in various places carry out this work, we will publish a series of articles explaining the Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives to farmers inside and outside the cooperatives, starting today, for everyone to use as material for speaking to farmers.

The Fundamental Principles of Running Agricultural Production Cooperatives He Cheng

There is a story: In ancient times, an old man gave each of his five sons an arrow and asked them to break the arrows. The five people did not use much effort and broke the arrows. The father took five more arrows and tied them together, asking them to take turns breaking them. Each of them used a lot of strength, but they could not break them. The father said, "Remember! You must be like these five arrows, always together, and no one will be able to defeat you."

This story illustrates the greatness of collective strength. "With three people of one mind, yellow earth can be turned into gold." Working people have always valued collective strength.

The Only Way to Get Rid of Poverty and Exploitation

The Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives begins by stating: "Agricultural production cooperatives are collective economic organizations of working farmers, organized by the farmers under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit." The cooperative concentrates the scattered strength of farmers into a strong collective, which can do all kinds of things that individual farmers cannot do, and withstand all kinds of difficulties that individual farmers cannot withstand.

What are some things that individual farmers cannot do? First, large-scale development of production; second, confidently overcome exploitation.

Although individual farmers in our country have gone through land reform, defeated the feudal system, and each household has a few acres to a dozen acres of land, most people do not have the strength to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, greatly increase fertilizer, and even less the strength to use new farm tools and improve farming techniques. In this way, how can we develop production on a large scale? If production cannot be developed, it is natural that we cannot become wealthy. When encountering disasters, diseases, and other unexpected events, many farmers are forced to sell their land, become hired laborers, and endure the exploitation of rich peasants and usurers, and fall into the deep pit of poverty again. This road is familiar to most farmers, how cruel, how painful! The peasants who have turned over naturally hope to never suffer that kind of pain again, hope to develop production on a large scale, and everyone will live a good life.

However, not just any kind of large-scale production is what we need. There are two types of large agricultural production: one is the estates operated by landlords and rich peasants in the past. In these estates, landlords and rich peasants exploit people, and peasants are exploited; many people remember what that kind of life was like very clearly. The productivity of this kind of estate is greater than that of individual farmers, but it makes a very small number of rich people richer and richer, and the majority of poor people poorer and poorer. For farmers, this is a dead end that absolutely cannot be taken. The other type is socialist and semi-socialist farms, which are state-owned farms, advanced and elementary forms of agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers who participate in cooperatives are equal, mutually beneficial, and mutually supportive, and there is no relationship of exploitation or being exploited. These farms will gradually adopt methods that are beneficial to both poor and middle peasants, and transfer land, draft animals, and large farm tools to the ownership of the cooperative. At that time, every member of the cooperative will be the owner of these means of production, and their production and life will be more reliably guaranteed. At that time, the working farmers will become rich together, and there will be "no distinction between poor and middle peasants."

Voluntary, Mutual Benefit

The Draft Model Charter stipulates that agricultural production cooperatives are mutually beneficial alliances of working farmers, that is, mutually beneficial alliances of poor and middle peasants. The Draft Model Charter stipulates this way because both poor and middle peasants need cooperatives, and poor peasants need cooperatives even more. Under the current conditions, if poor peasants and lower-middle peasants want to get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity, there is no other way to go except to organize cooperatives. Therefore, they have the highest enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperation. In various regions, there are some cooperatives with a majority of poor peasants, which initially lacked draft animals, farm tools, and fertilizer, and had many difficulties in production, and many people thought it would be difficult to run them well. However, because the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants who participated in these cooperatives "took the cooperative as their home" and worked hard, they finally managed to run them well. From this, we can see that the first condition for running a cooperative well is the socialist enthusiasm of the farmers, and not anything else. Isn't it very common sense that people will naturally try their best to do well what they like to do?

Well-to-do middle peasants also have enthusiasm for joining cooperatives. However, their enthusiasm is not as high as that of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. They have more and better land, draft animals, farm tools and experience. In the first year or two of the cooperative's establishment, production is generally not as good as theirs. Under these circumstances, they naturally do not think of the benefits of joining the cooperative. Some people are afraid that the valuation of land, draft animals, and farm tools will be too low, and they will worry that joining the cooperative may have disadvantages. They think this and that, and cannot make up their minds for a while. We should believe that these people will eventually take the road of cooperation. As long as the production of the cooperative develops and the policy of mutual benefit is implemented very well, they will join in. At present, in places where cooperatives have been established early and well, many well-to-do middle peasants have indeed voluntarily joined the cooperatives. If they are still unwilling to join, do not force them to join under any circumstances, as that will not do any good to the cooperative. If they are indeed willing to join, the cooperative should never exclude them. "The principle of developing agricultural production cooperatives is to rely on the poor peasants and consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants," which is the reason.

In the cooperation movement, some people exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperative, and some people force well-to-do middle peasants to join the cooperative. They have a common ideological source, which is that they believe that without strong livestock and good farm tools, the cooperative cannot be run. As a result, those who are willing to come cannot come, and those who are unwilling to come are forced to come. This violates a fundamental principle of running agricultural cooperatives - the principle of voluntariness.

We know that not only well-to-do middle peasants, but even poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, for various reasons, do not want to join the cooperative for a while. The Draft Model Charter stipulates that "Compulsory methods must not be used, but persuasive methods should be used, and examples should be set to make the farmers who have not joined the cooperative realize that joining the cooperative has only advantages and will not suffer losses, and therefore voluntarily join the cooperative." Farmers who have already joined the cooperative must never satirize or attack farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative. Farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative can also rest assured that the Party and the government will never force anyone to join the cooperative; if anyone forces you to join, that is a violation of the law, and if you are indeed willing to join but someone does not allow you to join, that is also wrong; you can criticize them or even go to the government to file a complaint.

There is another fundamental principle for running cooperatives, which is the principle of mutual benefit. Only by achieving mutual benefit can we guarantee true voluntariness. Mutual benefit basically refers to mutual benefit between poor and middle peasants.

The Draft Model Charter points out: "The development of agricultural cooperation is divided into two stages: elementary and advanced." The existing agricultural production cooperatives are generally elementary, that is, semi-socialist cooperatives. In this kind of cooperative, there are two kinds of remuneration, one is labor remuneration, and the other is remuneration for land, draft animals, farm tools, etc., that is, remuneration for means of production. Whether the cooperative has achieved mutual benefit depends mainly on whether the two kinds of remuneration are appropriately stipulated. How should the remuneration for means of production be determined? Generally speaking, middle peasants have more and better means of production (including land), and poor peasants have less and worse means of production. Compared with the amount of means of production and labor force possessed, generally speaking, poor peasants have more labor force and middle peasants have less labor force. If the remuneration for means of production is set too high, the total amount of labor remuneration will be reduced, and poor peasants will suffer; conversely, if it is set too low, middle peasants will suffer. No matter which household suffers, the cooperative cannot be consolidated. It should also be understood that our country's draft animals and farm tools are not considered sufficient, and the existing means of production can only be increased and developed, and must not be reduced or damaged. If the remuneration is not set reasonably, means of production such as livestock and farm tools are easily reduced or damaged. If either of these two situations occurs, the cooperative is not consolidated, or the draft animals and farm tools are damaged and reduced, which is very unfavorable to the country, very unfavorable to production, and very unfavorable to both poor and middle peasants. Because the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives in our country are still elementary cooperatives, the Draft Model Charter uses many provisions to solve the problem of handling means of production. However, although there are many provisions, there is only one spirit, that is, mutual benefit must be achieved, "without harming the interests of any poor peasant or the interests of any middle peasant." Of course, after developing into an advanced cooperative, the main means of production are already publicly owned, the members are all rich, and the distinction between poor and middle peasants cannot be made, and this problem no longer exists.

Taking Both Public and Private Interests Into Account

The Draft Model Charter states: "Agricultural production cooperatives should abide by the principle of taking both public and private interests into account when handling all economic issues within the cooperative, so that the interests of the state, the interests of the entire cooperative, and the personal interests of the members are correctly combined." This is also a very important principle for running a cooperative well. This principle applies to both elementary and advanced cooperatives. When handling all affairs of the cooperative, the interests of the members must be subordinate to the interests of the cooperative, and the interests of the cooperative must be subordinate to the interests of the state; however, the specific interests of the cooperative and the members should also be appropriately taken care of. For the sake of the interests of the state, the cooperative should respond to the call of the state and plant the crops that the state hopes to plant, according to its own specific conditions, and sell the things that the state purchases and purchases in full to the state. Experience has proved that whichever cooperative does this, that cooperative can also benefit itself. Because all the calls of the state are in line with both the interests of the state and the interests of the cooperative. For example, if the state calls on the cooperative to plant more high-yield crops, the cooperative should plant as much as possible. If the crops are harvested more, the state will certainly increase its food reserves, but the direct beneficiaries are first and foremost those cooperatives that respond to the call, isn't this the clearest thing?

The greatest interest of the members is to truly run the cooperative well. As long as the production of the cooperative increases and the distribution is done well, the income of the members will increase and they will become richer day by day. Every member should work hard, abide by discipline, cherish public property, enhance internal unity, run their own cooperative into a wealthy cooperative, and make themselves a wealthy member. Will the cooperative limit the members too much, making people feel very unfree? Everyone can rest assured about this, as long as it does not hinder the collective interests, the cooperative must take care of the personal interests of the members. For example, some side occupations are better operated individually than unified, and the cooperative should distribute them to the members for operation. The Draft Model Charter also stipulates: "Whether in the elementary or advanced stage of agricultural production cooperatives, the means of livelihood and small plots of land, scattered trees, poultry, livestock, and small farm tools owned by the members, as well as the tools needed to operate household side occupations, will not be collectivized." Some staff members of the cooperative, in order to show the "superiority" of the collective economy, want to "take care of" the daily life of the members, including the vegetables they eat and the pocket money they spend, abolish the members' private plots, and restrict the activities of the members. That is what they did wrong. Not only is it wrong to do this now, but it is also wrong to do this even if the advanced cooperative is established in the future. We must act in accordance with the provisions of the Draft Model Charter, and in order to take care of the needs of the members to grow vegetables or other horticultural crops, members are allowed to have small private plots.

More Pay for More Work

"Labor creates the world," a principle that is easy for working farmers to understand. Without the hard work of all the members, which cooperative can increase production, which piece of land can produce grain, and the cooperative is a collective economic organization of working farmers, there is no relationship of exploitation or being exploited, everyone is the master, and everyone relies on labor to eat, so we must implement "remuneration according to labor," which is an important principle for running a cooperative well. Not only must we "remunerate according to labor," but also "more pay for more work." This method is the most reasonable: if you work more and work well, your income will be more than others, wouldn't that be fair and just! This method rewards diligent people and urges lazy people, so that everyone goes in a good direction and becomes hardworking, caring about public interests, and living a prosperous life. Some cooperatives, when they were first established, some members did not work hard, mainly because they did not implement the principle of more pay for more work. "Whether you work or not, you get eighty percent," in cooperatives that adopt this egalitarian method, those who actively work do not get the remuneration they deserve, which is of course very unreasonable.

After implementing the principle of more pay for more work, we must continue to provide necessary care for the old, weak, and disabled members. Only by giving full play to the enthusiasm of everyone can we truly run the cooperative well. This kind of care, of course, cannot violate the principle of more pay for more work, but rather distributes work that suits their physical strength and skills, so that they can give full play to their strengths and enable the cooperative to develop a variety of economies.

Democracy, Unity, Progress

The Draft Model Charter also points out: "The internal life of agricultural production cooperatives should abide by the principles of democracy, unity, and continuous progress." The cooperative is a large family where members are united and friendly. In this large family, everyone is equal, mutually supportive, and cares for each other. Even a family has times when opinions differ, but this does not matter. Everyone can discuss it well, promote correct opinions, criticize incorrect opinions, distinguish right from wrong, and naturally find a unified opinion and a way to solve the problem.

Conducting full consultations on matters related to the public and causing controversy, and seeking appropriate solutions, this is the basic spirit of democratic management and an important condition for running a cooperative well. The implementation of democracy will surely achieve the goal of unity. Because the issues that cause controversy in the cooperative are often related to the policy of mutual benefit. After everyone's consultation, these issues are appropriately resolved, and the members will not be more united? The implementation of democracy can also promote the common progress of the members: correct shortcomings and improve socialist awareness. In order to better develop production, the cooperative cannot remain in the semi-socialist stage for a long time, but must gradually transition to a fully socialist advanced cooperative. There are two fundamental conditions for the transition: one condition is that production has developed to a certain extent, and the other condition is that the members' socialist awareness has been raised to a certain extent. In order to strengthen internal unity, strengthen the unity between this cooperative and other cooperatives and farmers outside the cooperative, in order to improve labor enthusiasm, in order to carry out the struggle against rich peasants and other exploiting elements, prevent and oppose capitalist tendencies within the cooperative (such as engaging in commercial exploitation, etc.) In order to ensure that the obligations due to the country are fulfilled, it is also necessary to continuously improve the political awareness of the members. Therefore, farmers who have joined the cooperative should constantly strive to study, improve their political awareness, respond to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and move forward to a brighter and happier socialist society.

    向农民讲解农业生产合作社示范章程草案
    编者按：中华人民共和国国务院关于发布农业生产合作社示范章程草案的通知中指出：各级人民委员会必须认真地组织力量，向区乡全体工作人员和当地的农业生产合作社社员讲解这个草案，指导各个合作社加以试用。同时，还应该采取适当办法，向没有入社的农民讲解这个草案，以便向他们进行有系统的关于农业合作化的宣传教育，并且听取他们对这个草案的意见。为了帮助各地工作人员进行这个工作，我们从今天起连续发表一批向社内外农民讲解农业生产合作社示范章程草案的文章，供给大家作为向农民讲话的材料。
    办农业生产合作社的根本原则  何成
    有这么一个故事：古时候，有个老汉，分给五个儿子每人一支箭，叫他们把箭折断。五个人没有费多大力气，都把箭折断了。父亲另拿五支箭捆在
  一起，叫他们轮流着折。他们每个人都用了很大力气，却怎么也折不断。父亲就说：“记住吧！你们要像这五支箭，常常在一起，谁都没法子把你们打败。”
    这个故事说明了集体力量的伟大。“三人一条心，黄土变成金。”劳动人民历来是重视集体力量的。
    摆脱贫穷和剥削的唯一道路
    农业生产合作社示范章程草案一开头就写着：“农业生产合作社是劳动农民的集体经济组织，是农民在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，按照自愿和互利的原则组织起来的”。合作社把农民分散的力量集中起来，变成一个坚强的集体，它能做得出单个农民做不到的种种事情，经得起单干农民受不了的种种的困难。
    哪些事情是单个农民作不到的呢？第一、大规模地发展生产；第二、有把握地战胜剥削。
    我国的个体农民，虽然经过土地改革，打垮了封建制度，每家每户有了几亩地到十几亩地。但是，多数人没有力量大量兴修水利，大量增加肥料，更没有力量使用新式农具，改良耕作技术。这样，怎么能够大规模发展生产呢？不能发展生产，自然不能富裕。遇到灾荒、疾病等等意外事情，不少农民被逼着卖土地，当雇工，忍受富农和高利贷主的剥削，又陷到穷困的深坑里去。这条道路是多数农民都熟悉的，多么残酷，多么痛苦！翻了身的农民当然希望永远不再受那种痛苦，希望大规模地发展生产，大家都过好日子。
    但是，并不是随便哪一种大生产都是我们所需要的。有两种大的农业生产：一种是过去的经营地主和大富农所经营的农庄。在这种农庄里，地主、富农剥削人，农民被剥削；那种日子是什么味道，许多人记的很清楚。这种农庄的生产力比个体农民的大，但是它使极少数富人越来越富，使大多数穷人越来越穷。对农民来说，这是一条绝对不能走的死路。另一种是社会主义和半社会主义的农庄，这就是国营农场、高级和初级形式的农业生产合作社。参加合作社的农民是平等的、互利的、互助的，没有任何剥削和被剥削的关系。这种农庄要一步步地采用对贫农、中农都有利的办法，把土地、耕畜、大农具转为合作社所有。那时候，每一个社员都是这些生产资料的主人，他们的生产和生活就会获得更可靠的保障。那时候，劳动农民共同富裕起来，就“没有贫农和中农的区别”了。
      自愿，互利
    示范章程草案规定，农业生产合作社是劳动农民互相有利的联合，也就是贫农和中农互相有利的联合。示范章程草案所以这样规定，是因为贫农、中农都很需要合作社，贫农更加需要合作社。在目前的条件下面，贫农和下中农要想摆脱贫困，走向富裕，除了组织合作社，再没有别的路可走。所以他们走合作化道路的积极性最高。各个地区都有些贫农占多数的合作社，起初缺少耕畜、农具、肥料，生产上困难很多，许多人认为很难办好。但是，因为参加这些社的贫农、下中农“以社为家”，埋头苦干，最后到底办好了。从这里可以看出来，办好合作社的第一个条件，是农民的社会主义积极性，而不是别的什么。对于自己喜欢的事情，自然会想尽办法把它作好，这还不是很平常的道理吗？
    富裕中农也有参加合作社的积极性。但是，他们的积极性没有贫农和下中农的高。他们有比较多、比较好的土地、耕畜、农具和经验。合作社刚成立的一两年，生产一般还赶不上他们。在这种情况下，他们自然想不到参加合作社的好处。有些人害怕土地、耕畜、农具作价太低，还会顾虑参加合作社可能有坏处，想这想那，一时拿不定主意。应该相信这些人终于也要走合作化的道路。只要合作社的生产发展了，互利政策执行的又很好，他们就会参加进来。目前，在合作社办得早办得好的地方，已经有不少富裕中农也确实自愿加入合作社了。他们如果还不愿加入，无论如何不要强迫他们加入，那样对合作社不会有什么好处。如果他们确实自愿加入，合作社也决不应该排斥他们。“农业生产合作社的发展原则是依靠贫农，巩固地联合中农”，就是这个道理。
    在合作化运动中，有些人排斥贫农入社，有些人强拉富裕中农入社，他们有一个共同的思想根源，就是认为没有强的牲畜，好的农具，合作社就没法办。结果，愿意来的不能来，不愿来的硬被拉了来。这就违背了办农业合作社的一条根本原则——自愿原则。
    我们知道，不仅富裕中农，甚至贫农和下中农，因为种种原因，都有一时不想参加合作社的。示范章程草案规定，“决不能用强迫的方法，应该用劝说的方法，并且作出榜样，使没有入社的农民认识到入社只有好处，不会吃亏，因而自愿地入社”。已经加入合作社的农民，决不要讽刺和打击还没有入社的农民。还没有入社的农民也可以放心，党和政府决不强迫任何一个人加入合作社；如果有人强迫你们加入，那就是犯了法，如果你们确实自愿入社却有人不许你加入，那也是错误的；你们可以批评他们甚至到政府去告状。
    办合作社还有一条根本原则，就是互利原则。只有做到互利才能保证真正自愿。互利，基本上是指贫农和中农之间的互利。
    示范章程草案指出：“农业生产合作化的发展，分做初级和高级两个阶段。”现有的农业生产合作社一般的都是初级的，也就是半社会主义性质的合作社。在这种合作社里，有两种报酬，一种是劳动报酬，一种是土地、耕畜、农具等等的报酬，也就是生产资料报酬。合作社是不是作到了互利，最主要的是看这两种报酬规定的恰当不恰当。生产资料的报酬该怎么确定呢？一般地说，中农的生产资料（包括土地）较多较好，贫农的生产资料较少较坏。拿占有的生产资料和劳动力的多少来比，一般地说，贫农的劳动力比较多，中农的劳动力比较缺。生产资料报酬定高了，劳动报酬的总数就要减少，贫农就会吃亏；相反，定低了，中农就会吃亏。不管谁家吃了亏，合作社都不能巩固。还应该了解，我国的耕畜、农具是不算很够用的，现有的生产资料只能增加、发展，决不能减少、损坏。如果报酬定的不合理，像牲畜、农具这样的生产资料，就很容易减少或者损坏。如果发生了这两种情形，合作社不巩固，或者耕畜农具损坏了减少了，对国家很不利，对生产很不利，对贫农、中农都很不利。因为我国目前的农业生产合作社绝大多数还是初级社，所以示范章程草案用了很多条文解决处理生产资料的问题。不过，条文虽然很多，精神只有一个，就是必须作到互利，“不损害任何贫农的利益，也不损害任何中农的利益”。当然，发展成高级社以后，主要生产资料已经公有，社员们都富裕起来，分不出贫农和中农了，这个问题也就不存在了。
    公私兼顾
    示范章程草案上说：“农业生产合作社在处理社内一切经济问题的时候，应该遵守公私兼顾的原则，使国家的利益、全社的利益和社员个人的利益得到正确的结合。”这也是办好合作社的一条很重要的原则。这一条原则，不管在初级社和高级社都适用。处理合作社的一切事情，社员的利益都要服从社的利益，社的利益都要服从国家的利益；但是，合作社和社员的具体利益，也应该得到适当的照顾。为了国家的利益，合作社要根据本身的具体条件，响应国家的号召，种植国家希望种植的庄稼，把国家统购和收购的东西如数卖给国家。经验证明，哪个合作社这样作了，哪个合作社自己也能得到好处。因为国家的一切号召，都是既符合国家的利益，又符合合作社的利益。比如，国家号召合作社多种高产量作物，合作社应该尽可能地多种些。庄稼收的多了，国家固然增加了粮食后备，但直接得到利益的，首先还是那些响应号召的合作社，这不是最清楚的事情吗？
    社员最大的利益，是把合作社真正办好。只要合作社的生产增加了，分配搞好了，社员的收入就会增加，一天天地富裕起来。每一个社员都应该努力劳动，遵守纪律，爱护公共财产，增进社内团结，把自己的社办成富裕的社，使自己成为一个富裕的社员。合作社会不会把社员限的太死，使人觉得很不自由呢？这一点，大家也可以放心，只要不妨碍集体利益，合作社一定要照顾社员的个人利益。比如，有些副业，个人经营比统一经营好一些，合作社就应该把它分给社员经营。示范章程草案上还规定：“无论在农业生产合作社的初级阶段或者高级阶段，社员所有的生活资料和小块园地、零星树木、家禽、家畜、小农具、经营家庭副业所需要的工具，都不实行公有化。”有些社的工作人员，为了显示集体经济的“优越性”，想把社员的日常生活，包括吃的菜蔬，花的零用钱，都由合作社“包下来”，取消社员的自留地，限制社员的活动。那是他们做错了。不但眼下这样做是不对的，就是将来办成了高级社也不能这样做。一定要按照示范章程草案的规定办事，为了照顾社员种植蔬菜或者别的园艺作物的需要，允许社员有小块的自留地。
      多劳多得
   “劳动创造世界”，这个道理，劳动农民是容易懂的。如果没有全体社员的辛勤劳动，哪个合作社能够增产，哪块地里能打粮食，合作社是劳动农民的集体经济组织，这里边没有剥削和被剥削的关系，大家都是主人，都靠劳动吃饭，所以要实行“按劳计酬”，这是办好合作社的一个重要原则。不仅要“按劳计酬”，而且要“多劳多得”。这种办法最合理：劳动的多，劳动的好，收入也比别人多，岂非天公地道！这种办法奖励勤劳的人，督促懒惰的人，使大家都往好处走，都变成辛勤劳动、关心公共利益和生活富裕的人。有些合作社在刚刚成立的时候，有的社员劳动的不起劲，主要是没有实行多劳多得的原则。“干不干，八分半”，在采用这种平均主义办法的合作社中，积极劳动的得不到应得的报酬，当然很不合理。
    实行多劳多得的原则以后，要继续对老弱残废的社员加以必要的照顾。只有发挥了每一个人的积极性，才能把合作社真正办好。这种照顾，当然不能违背多劳多得的原则，而是分配适合他们的体力、技术的工作，使他们能够发挥所长，使合作社能够发展多种经济。
      民主，团结，进步
    示范章程草案上还指出：“农业生产合作社的内部生活，应该遵守民主的原则、团结的原则和不断进步的原则。”合作社是社员团结友爱的大家庭。在这个大家庭中，人人都是平等的、互助的、彼此关怀的。一家人也有意见不一致的时候，但这并不要紧，大家可以很好地商量，发扬正确的意见，批评不正确的意见，分清事情的是非，自然会找出统一意见、解决问题的办法。
      遇到关系众人的、引起争论的事情，进行充分的协商，求得适当的解决，这就是民主管理的基本精神，是办好合作社的重要条件。实行民主必能达到团结的目的。因为合作社中引起争论的问题，常常是有关互利政策的问题。经过大家的协商，适当地解决了这些问题，社员们那会不更加团结呢？实行民主还能促使社员共同进步：纠正缺点，提高社会主义觉悟。为了更好地发展生产，合作社不能长期停留在半社会主义的阶段，而要逐步向完全社会主义的高级社过渡。过渡的根本条件有两个：一个条件是生产发展到了一定程度，另一个条件是社员们社会主义觉悟提高到了一定程度。为了加强社内团结，加强本社和别的社以及社外农民的团结，为了提高劳动积极性，为了开展对富农和别的剥削分子的斗争，防止和反对社内的资本主义倾向（像进行商业剥削等等）为了保证尽到对国家应尽的义务，也必须不断地提高社员的政治觉悟。因此，入了社的农民应该不断努力学习，提高自己的政治觉悟，响应共产党和人民政府的号召，向更加光明更加幸福的社会主义社会前进。
