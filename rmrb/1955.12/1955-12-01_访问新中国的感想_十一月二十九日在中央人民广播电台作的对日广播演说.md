    Impressions of Visiting New China
    ——Radio Address to Japan from the Central People's Broadcasting Station on November 29th
    Saburo Endo, Member of the "National League for the Defense of the Constitution" Delegation to China, Former Lieutenant General of the Army

    I am Endo, and I joined the New China visiting delegation of the National League for the Defense of the Constitution. I came to China on November 6th for a trip of about one month.

    The purpose of the delegation's visit was to correctly understand the situation in New China and promote friendly relations between China and Japan. My personal reasons for participating in this visit are as follows:

    First, as you all know, since the outbreak of the Korean War, I have been strongly opposed to Japan's rearmament. One of the reasons I oppose it is that "Communist countries will never launch an armed invasion of Japan." I want to find out if my judgment is wrong.

    Second, from 1922 to 1941, I visited China several times as a traveler, a civil servant, or a soldier. I would like to know how different the Old China I saw then is from today's New China.

    Third, I want to pay tribute to the spirits of many predecessors and colleagues who died in China, especially those comrades who were once under my command. I also want to personally visit the war criminals and Japanese residents in custody. Furthermore, we, the former Japanese soldiers, have done many things that we are sorry for the Chinese people. As a former soldier, I would like to express my heartfelt regret.

    Thanks to the extremely kind assistance of the gentlemen of the New China authorities, especially the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, these wishes have been fulfilled. Soon, I will return home to report to you. Today, thanks to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station for arranging this broadcast opportunity for me, I would like to briefly share my feelings with you.

    First, regarding the issue of communist countries' external aggression, at least as far as New China is concerned, I firmly believe that my judgment is absolutely correct.

    There are many reasons for this, and there is no time to list them all here. New China is currently planning long-term construction. In order to implement this plan and to preserve and develop what has already been built successfully, peace is absolutely necessary, and war is the biggest obstacle. For the needs of construction, New China has sufficient population, territory, and resources. Not only is it unnecessary to invade other countries, but it is also unwilling to increase its own burden. Moreover, aggression is bound to fail. The leaders and people of New China are very clear about the above points. In addition, they have experienced long periods of war and disaster in the past. Therefore, they extremely hate war and sincerely love peace.

    This is by no means an arbitrary conclusion I have drawn from a short period of observation.

    The above views have been further strengthened after my long and private talks with Premier Zhou, especially with Vice Premier Marshal Chen Yi on the 16th, and with Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi today. We all discarded diplomatic niceties and spoke as fellow soldiers.

    On the 20th, I met many Japanese people living in Shenyang. They all said in unison that the Chinese people are peace-loving and hope to be friendly with Japan. As if to confirm these words, many government officials we came into contact with during our trip, not to mention the urban or rural residents, whether men, women, old or young, all without exception held a cordial attitude towards us Japanese. In this light, the idea that they want to invade Japan is simply untenable.

    Looking at construction, not to mention the construction of schools and factories, even the water conservancy projects are very magnificent. From a military point of view, there is no atmosphere of air defense at all. Just from these aspects, we can know that China is a peaceful country.

    Second, regarding the changes between Old and New China, there are too many to mention. The most profound impressions are that the country is very clean and everyone is smiling.

    In my memory, Old China was synonymous with dirtiness, and people had no smiles on their faces. But this time I came to China, and seeing the cleanliness and everyone's smiling faces, I really feel like I have been transported to another era.

    We also visited Hong Kong and Kowloon, which are still under British rule, on the 7th. It is still the same as in the past, with notices everywhere saying "Heavy fines for spitting." But despite this, we do not necessarily feel clean. I feel that compared to when I passed through Hong Kong on my way to France 30 years ago, it is even dirtier. But crossing the border into New China gives one a refreshing feeling.

    In New China, you don't see the kind of notices posted in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Everything is cleaned very thoroughly, and there are trash cans and spittoons everywhere, making it very clean.

    The Chinese people I saw in Hong Kong and Kowloon seemed tired, while almost every man, woman, old and young in New China seemed happy. The most significant change is the attitude of women. In my memory, women in Old China, except for those who were particularly close, would not easily approach foreigners, especially during the war, they would always hide from Japanese visitors. But this time, whether it was female students at school, female workers in factories, or housewives or young women in the countryside, they all came out to welcome us with friendly smiles, and even reached out to shake our hands. I think this is definitely not deliberate pretense.

    A few days ago, we saw the newsreel of the New China National Day and the newsreel of the Chinese commodity exhibition in Tokyo that we brought this time. Compared to the joyful and cheerful appearance of the New China children in the National Day newsreel, the Japanese children who appeared in the commodity exhibition newsreel were much more somber. I was shocked by this. The lives of the people of New China cannot be said to be affluent at present, but since the founding of New China, the people have been liberated from exploitation and oppression, and there is no need to worry about their daily lives. It seems that everyone has great hopes for the future.

    Peace and prosperity are the goals of the country, and also the goals of the people. Leaders and the people are heading towards the same goal, working together in the same boat, united and happy. The effects of this effort have gradually become apparent, and the people's lives are improving day by day. The people's trust in the leaders also seems to be increasing day by day.

    In the past, Chinese people often said "mei fa zi" (没法子), meaning there was no way, let it go. Now this desperate catchphrase has disappeared. Today, they are replacing it with energetic phrases such as "Let the high mountains bow their heads to us, and let the great rivers make way for us," which means "nothing is impossible on our path forward."

    Third, when I expressed my apology to the Chinese people in the position of a former Japanese soldier, they all said in unison, "Let the past be washed away, let's talk about the future!" There is no resentment whatsoever here. Also, when I met with the Japanese people residing in Shenyang, many Japanese people in Tianjin preparing to board a ship to return home, and all the war criminals imprisoned in Fushun, they not only did not have any dissatisfaction with me as a former soldier, but on the contrary, they said a lot of words of gratitude and encouragement for my opposition to Japan's rearmament and my efforts to promote friendship between China and Japan. I really don't deserve it.

    I have nothing to say about the heroic spirits who died in battle in China. I can only sincerely pray for their peace. The people of New China hope for Japan's prosperity and are willing to be friendly with Japan. This is not flattery, but a sincere call from China. They have no jealousy or prejudice towards Japan's prosperity. We also hope for New China's prosperity, and shouldn't we also extend a helping hand to their prosperous cause? I think only by trusting each other and cooperating closely in this way can we comfort the heroic spirits of our predecessors and colleagues who are forever sleeping in China. From newspaper reports, I learned that the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party have merged, and the third Hatoyama Cabinet has been formed. As a Japanese citizen, I am naturally happy. However, one of the three major policies of the new cabinet, namely the preparation to amend the constitution, if this is to promote Japan's rearmament, I have no choice but to firmly oppose it.

    Even today, if we do not correctly understand New China and instead carry out rearmament, then I can assert: Japan will inevitably become an orphan in the Orient and a laggard in the world. Broadcast over.

### 访问新中国的感想——十一月二十九日在中央人民广播电台作的对日广播演说

    访问新中国的感想
    ——十一月二十九日在中央人民广播电台作的对日广播演说
    日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团员  前陆军中将  远藤三郎
    我是远藤，这一次参加拥护宪法国民联合会的新中国访问团，于十一月六日前来中国，作为期约一个月的旅行。
    访华团访问的目的是为了正确地认识新中国的情况，促进中日两国的友好亲善关系，而我个人参加这次访问，特别还有如下的理由。
    第一、你们都知道，自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，我一直是强烈地反对日本重整军备的，我所以反对的理由之一是“共产国家决不致对日本进行武装侵略”，我要弄清楚我的判断到底有无错误。
    第二、我从一九二二年到一九四一年二十年之间，或以旅行者资格或以公务员资格或以军人资格曾经好几次到过中国，我很想知道一下当时我所看到的旧中国同今天的新中国究竟有多少差别。
    第三、我要吊慰不少在中国死亡的先辈僚友，尤其是那些曾经在我指挥下的战友们的幽灵，同时也想亲自访问一下在押战犯和日本侨民。再则，我们旧日本军人曾经做了许多对不起中国人民的事情，我作为一个旧军人想对此表示衷心的遗憾之意。
    由于新中国当局各位先生，尤其是外交学会无比好意的协助，这些愿望已经达到，不久，我将回国向诸位作报告。今天承北京人民广播电台为我安排了广播机会，我想就我所感，略略和诸位谈谈。
    第一点，关于共产国家对外侵略问题，这一点至少对新中国来说，我坚信我的判断是绝对没有错误的。
    关于这一点有很多理由，这里是没有时间一一列举出来。新中国目前正在计划着长期的建设，为了要执行这个计划，为了要保存并发展已经建设成功的东西，绝对需要和平，而战争却是最大的障碍。为了建设的需要，新中国的人口、领土、资源等都十分充足，不仅没有必要向他国侵略，而且也不愿增加自己的负担，再则，进行侵略必定要失败，新中国的领导人和人民对于上面各点是十分明白的，再加上过去，他们曾经历过长期的战争灾害，因此，他们是极端憎恶战争，衷心爱好和平的。
    这决不是我从短时间的考察所得到的武断的结论。
    以上的看法，由于我和周总理，尤其是十六日和副总理陈毅元帅，今天和水利部长傅作义大将大家以军人的特别关系抛弃外交辞令作了长时间的单独会谈以后，更使我深信不疑。
    二十日我在沈阳会见了许多留住当地的日本人士，他们都异口同声地说中国人是爱好和平的，是希望和日本亲善的，似乎为了证实这些话，我们旅行中所接触的许多政府要人，当然不必说，无论是城市居民或乡村居民，无论男女老幼，毫无例外地都衷心地对我们日本人抱着亲切的态度。这样看来，认为他们要侵略日本的想法究竟是不能成立的。
    再从建设方面看，学校、工厂的建筑自不必提，连水利工程也十分雄伟，从军事上说像防空那种气氛一点也看不到，仅仅从这些方面看来也可以知道中国是和平的国家。
    第二点，关于新旧中国的变化，这也是不胜枚举的。印象最深刻的是国内很清洁，人人都笑容满面。
    在我的记忆中，旧中国是肮脏的代名词，人们没有一点笑容，可是这一次来中国，看到国内的清洁干净和人人笑容满面，真使我有隔世之感。
    今天尚处在英国统治下的香港、九龙，我们也于七日游览了一次，它还是和过去一样到处写着“吐痰者受重罚”的禁条，但是尽管如此，我们还是不一定感觉到清洁，我感到比起三十年前我去法国时路过的香港来，毋宁是要肮脏得多了。可是跨过国境线，进入新中国就有一种令人爽快的感觉。
    在新中国你看不到像在香港、九龙所张贴的那种禁条，到处都打扫得很干净，备有废物箱和痰盂，非常清洁。
    我在香港、九龙所看到的中国人，似乎显着疲惫的样子，而新中国的男女老少几乎没有一个例外的似乎都很幸福。最显著的变化是妇女的态度，在我的记忆中，旧中国的妇女除了特别亲近的人以外，对外人是不轻易接近的，尤其是在战争期间对于日本人的访问，总是躲藏的。可是这一次我看见学校里的女学生也好，工厂的女工也好，农村里的家庭主妇或者姑娘们也好，都是亲切地笑容满面地出来欢迎，甚至还伸出手来和我们握手。我想这决不是故意的做作。
    前些日子我们看了新中国国庆节的新闻片子，也看了我们这次带来的东京的中国商品展览会的新闻片。比起在中国国庆节新闻片里的新中国儿童们的快乐欢欣的样子来，在商品展览会新闻片中所出现的日本儿童实在要沉暗得多，我为此吃了一惊。现在新中国人民的生活决不能说是富裕的，但是自从新中国成立以来，人民已从剥削与压迫中解放出来，每天的生活用不着担心，看来人人对将来都抱着莫大的希望。
    和平与繁荣是国家的目标，同时也是人民的目标。领导者和民众向着这个同一的目标，同舟共济，团结一致，愉快地工作着。这种努力的成效已经渐渐表现出来，人民的生活一天比一天提高，而人民对于领导者的信任，看来也是在日益加强之中。
    过去中国人常说“没法子”，意思是毫无办法，让它去吧。现在这一个绝望的口头禅已经消灭，今天他们正以“让高山向我们低头，叫大河给我们让路”，——也就是说“在我们前进的道路上没有不可能”——这种朝气蓬勃的语句来代替。
    第三点，当我以旧日本军人地位向中国人民表示抱歉之意，他们都是异口同声说，“让以往的事情付诸流水，让我们来谈谈未来吧！”这里一点也看不出有任何怨恨之色。还有我和留居在沈阳的日本人，在天津准备候船回国的许多日本人以及关在抚顺的全体战犯们会见时，他们对于我是旧军人一点，不仅没有任何不满之意，相反的，对于我反对日本重整军备，为中日两国亲善而竭尽棉力等等却说了很多感谢和鼓励的话，真叫我不敢当。
    对于在中国阵亡的英灵，我无话可说，我只以诚意默祷他们的冥福。新中国的人们希望日本繁荣，并且愿意同日本友好。这决不是奉承的话，而是中国真诚的呼声，他们对于日本的繁荣没有嫉妒和偏见。我们也期望新中国的繁荣，而且我们对于他们的繁荣事业不是也应该伸出可能帮助的手吗？我想只有这样互相信任，亲密合作，才能慰藉永眠在中国的先辈僚友的英灵。从报纸上报道知道自由党和民主党已经合并，第三次鸠山内阁也已成立，我是日本国民之一，当然也是一样高兴。但是新内阁三大政策之一，即准备修改宪法一点，如果这是促进日本重整军备的话，我是不得不坚决加以反对。
    时到今天，还不去正确认识新中国，却要进行重整军备，那末，我可以断定：日本必然将成为东洋的孤儿和世界的落伍者。广播完了。
