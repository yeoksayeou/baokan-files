    英国政府改组
    新华社二十一日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登在二十日晚上宣布英国政府改组。
    原任财政大臣的巴特勒调任掌玺大臣。他还兼任保守党下院领袖。原任掌玺大臣和保守党下院领袖的克鲁克山克已经辞职。
    原任外交大臣的麦克米伦调任财政大臣，原任国防大臣的劳埃德调任外交大臣，原任劳工大臣的蒙克顿调任国防大臣。
    此外，还有一些大臣辞职或调职。
    在英国政府的这次改组正式宣布以前，西方报纸和通讯社就已经透露了改组的消息和所以要改组的一些原因。美联社的消息指出，麦克米伦和巴特勒近来都受到攻击。麦克米伦因为他对英国外交政策的领导受到了指责。而巴特勒，据路透社说，“在英国最近的经济困难时期”受到了“猛烈的攻击”，他十月间提出的补充预算案引起了“暴风雨般猛烈的抗议”，甚至在保守党年会上，他的经济政策也不断受到责难。
