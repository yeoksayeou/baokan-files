Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency on December 15th, Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently answered some questions raised by Lucien Bodard, a reporter from the French newspaper "France-Soir," regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the reunification of Vietnam.

Pham Van Dong said that the South Vietnamese authorities' planned refusal to hold consultative conferences with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss holding general elections to achieve Vietnam's reunification is one of the clearest actions violating Article 14(a) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam and Articles 6 and 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

In response to the question of whether France had fulfilled its obligations under the Geneva Accords and regarding Franco-Vietnamese relations, Pham Van Dong said that although the French government had issued a statement expressing its support for the implementation of the Geneva Accords, it had in fact been evading its obligations in implementing the political clauses of the Geneva Accords, namely achieving Vietnam's reunification through free general elections.

Pham Van Dong said that relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France could be improved on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, provided that both sides were sincere. The recently concluded trade agreement is the first step. The question now is to take further steps. The principle of reciprocity should be observed in establishing diplomatic representation between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France.

Pham Van Dong condemned Ngo Dinh Diem's so-called "referendum" as a violation of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. He said that it is impossible to build anything solid and lasting by violating the will of the people, through terror, and in violation of international agreements.

When talking about the attitude towards Bao Dai, Pham Van Dong quoted what President Ho Chi Minh said in his New Year's greetings in 1955: "We are ready to sincerely unite with any individual or group who desires peace, unity, independence, and democracy."

In response to the question about the United States' policy in South Vietnam, Pham Van Dong said that the policy pursued by the United States in South Vietnam aims at systematically undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords. This policy endangers peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Pham Van Dong finally stated that, according to the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnamese people are determined to achieve the reunification of their country within the framework of the Geneva Accords. He said that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, especially France, which signed the Geneva Accords, have a responsibility to correctly implement these agreements.

    就有关履行日内瓦协定和越南统一等问题
    范文同总理答法国“法兰西晚报”记者问
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南民主共和国总理范文同最近曾经回答了“法兰西晚报”记者吕希恩·波达尔提出的有关履行日内瓦协定和越南统一的一些问题。
    范文同说，越南南方当局有计划地拒绝同越南民主共和国政府举行协商会议讨论举行普选以实现越南统一的问题，是最明显的破坏越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条甲款和日内瓦会议最后宣言第六条和第七条的行动之一。
    范文同在回答关于法国是否已经履行它根据日内瓦协定所承担的义务以及关于法越关系的问题时说，虽然法国政府发表声明表示赞成执行日内瓦协定，但是，它实际上一直在规避它在执行日内瓦协定的政治条款，即通过自由普选来实现越南的统一方面承担的义务。
    范文同说，越南民主共和国和法国之间的关系可以在双方都抱有诚意的情况下在平等互利的基础上得到改善。最近缔结的贸易协定是第一个步骤。现在的问题是采取另外的步骤。在越南民主共和国和法国之间设立外交代表问题上应该遵守对等的原则。
    范文同谴责吴庭艳举行的所谓“公民投票”是违反日内瓦会议最后宣言的行为。他说，在违反人民的意志、通过恐怖手段和违反国际协定的情况下是不可能建立起任何坚固和持久的东西的。
    在谈到对保大的态度时，范文同引述了胡志明主席在一九五五年新年贺词中所说的话：“我们准备真诚地团结任何希望和平、统一、独立和民主的个人或团体。”
    范文同在回答关于美国在越南南方的政策的问题时说，美国在越南南方实行的政策目的在于有计划地破坏日内瓦协定的执行。这种政策危害了印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    范文同最后表示，根据越南祖国战线的纲领，越南人民坚决主张在日内瓦协定的范围以内实现他们国家的统一。他说，日内瓦会议的参加国，特别是在日内瓦协定上签字的法国，对正确地履行这些协定负有责任。
