    Some University Teachers in Beijing
    Prepare to Participate in National Doctoral and Associate Doctoral Degree Examinations
    Some university teachers in Beijing have begun writing dissertations or pursuing advanced studies in their specialties, preparing to participate in the national doctoral and associate doctoral degree examinations.
    Pan Jiluan, a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University, has begun writing his associate doctoral dissertation based on the results he obtained in researching the welding of aluminum containing alloys, preparing to take the examination. Twelve teachers in the Department of Finance at Renmin University of China are taking remedial classes. They will take remedial classes for one year and then prepare according to the advanced study bibliography for their specialties, striving to reach the level of associate doctoral candidates within five years. Teachers in the Basic Teaching and Research Section of Marxism-Leninism, when establishing their advanced study plans, referred to the required reading lists for associate doctoral candidates in related disciplines in the Soviet Union and added works such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "A History of the Chinese Revolution." They require that they grasp the essential spirit of the important theories in these original works and be able to analyze practical problems with the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. The advanced study plans of teachers at Renmin University of China are formulated in conjunction with the teaching progress, and the results they receive in advanced study can directly improve the quality of teaching.
    Some teachers from Peking University, Beijing Agricultural University, and other universities have also formulated plans to complete advanced studies in their specialties in about five years and submit dissertations to participate in the national degree examinations. (Xinhua News Agency)
