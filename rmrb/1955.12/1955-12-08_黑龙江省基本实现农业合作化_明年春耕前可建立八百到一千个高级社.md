Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Heilongjiang Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization ahead of schedule. By the end of this year, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives across the province will reach more than 75% of the total number of peasant households in the province. In some counties, such as Keshan, Huachuan, and Hailun, the number of households joining cooperatives has reached or is about to reach 90%. Currently, the work of expanding old cooperatives across the province is nearing completion. The plan to establish more than 16,000 new cooperatives has also been more than 70% completed. The focus of work in the province will shift to consolidating new cooperatives and improving old cooperatives, and universally starting to pilot district-level advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. It is expected that 800 to 1,000 advanced cooperatives can be established throughout the province before next spring plowing.

The basic agricultural cooperativization of Heilongjiang Province was achieved after three years of pilot agricultural producers' cooperatives from 1951 to 1953 and two waves of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives last year and this year. Since August of this year, rural work cadres at all levels in the province have successively studied Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, seriously criticized and corrected right-leaning conservative thoughts, and at the same time, leaders at all levels conscientiously implemented the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," and conducted in-depth socialist education for the broad masses of peasants. Thus, a new wave of agricultural cooperativization, which was massive, rapid, and orderly, was formed throughout the province. In many places, new situations have emerged where the entire class of poor and lower-middle peasants demanded to join cooperatives. Upper-middle peasants who had not joined cooperatives saw that the vast majority of upper-middle peasants who had joined cooperatives had increased their income and exceeded their own production level, and 65% to 75% of the households voluntarily signed up to join cooperatives.

Following closely on the heels of the agricultural cooperativization wave is a new production upsurge. New cooperative members are full of enthusiasm and active in labor after joining the cooperative, and universally demand to expand production. In Huachuan County alone, agricultural producers' cooperatives have reported that they will reclaim more than 7,000 hectares of wasteland next year. Now, in counties that have completed or are about to complete the work of expanding cooperatives and establishing cooperatives, new and old cooperatives have successively begun to study the draft model charter for agricultural producers' cooperatives; formulate their own cooperative charter and long-term development production plans and next year's production plan, and begin to carry out winter production and preparations for increasing production next year. In order to meet the requirements of the production upsurge, the training of a large number of new agricultural tool technicians, animal husbandry technicians and other technical personnel will also begin.

### 黑龙江省基本实现农业合作化  明年春耕前可建立八百到一千个高级社

    黑龙江省基本实现农业合作化
    明年春耕前可建立八百到一千个高级社
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　黑龙江省已经提前基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。到今年年底以前，全省入社农户可达全省农户总数的百分之七十五以上。克山、桦川、海伦等部分县的入社农户已经达到或即将达到百分之九十。目前，全省老社扩社工作接近结束。建立一万六千多个新社的计划，也已经完成百分之七十以上。全省的工作重心将转入整顿巩固新社和提高老社，普遍开始试办区级的高级农业生产合作社。预计在明年春耕以前，全省可以建立八百个到一千个高级社。
    黑龙江省农业的基本合作化，是经过一九五一年到一九五三年的三年试办农业生产合作社和去年、今年两个发展农业生产合作社的浪潮以后才实现的。今年八月以来，全省各级农村工作干部先后学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，严肃地批判和纠正了右倾保守思想，同时，各级领导认真地贯彻执行了“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，并且向广大农民深入地进行了社会主义教育，于是在全省形成了声势浩大、进展迅速、多而不乱的新的农业合作化浪潮。许多地方出现了贫农、下中农整个阶层要求入社的新情况。没有入社的上中农看到入社的上中农绝大多数增加了收入，超过了自己的生产水平，也有百分之六十五到七十五的农户自愿报名入社。
    紧跟着农业合作化浪潮而来的是新的生产高潮。新社员入社以后，情绪饱满，劳动积极，普遍要求扩大生产。单是桦川一个县，农业生产合作社就自报明年要开荒七千多公顷。现在，已经或即将完成扩社、建社工作的县，新社和老社相继开始学习农业生产合作社示范章程草案；制定本社社章和长期发展生产的规划和明年生产计划，开始进行冬季生产和明年增产的准备工作。为适应生产高潮的要求，大批新农具手、畜牧手等技术人材的训练工作也将开始进行。
