Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. The National Minority Language Science Symposium, jointly convened by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Institute for Nationalities, opened this morning in Beijing. Over 160 people attended the symposium, including responsible individuals and representatives from relevant provincial ethnic affairs commissions, education departments, ethnic institutes, autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, as well as representatives from relevant publishing houses, ethnic language research institutions, and ethnic language scientists.

Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee, Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Jiafu, Deputy President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, G.M. Ma Lycev, Educational Consultant of the State Council, and G.P. Serdyuchenko, Advisor of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Central Institute for Nationalities, all participated in the meeting. Representatives from various cultural and educational departments of the Central People's Government and universities and scientific research institutions in Beijing also attended the meeting.

Pan Zinian, Deputy Director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening address. He said: The purpose of this National Minority Language Science Symposium is to understand the state of ethnic language work, exchange experiences in ethnic language work, exchange opinions, and discuss how to better assist minority nationalities in creating, improving, and reforming written languages, so as to promote the political, economic, and cultural construction of minority nationality areas. He said that this is the first time such a meeting to discuss issues related to minority languages and scripts has been held in Chinese scientific circles, which is a major event for China's minority nationalities and Chinese science circles, and also a major event in China's socialist construction.

Wu Yuzhang spoke at the meeting. He said: Among the minority nationalities in our country, those without a written language or without a commonly used written language account for about two-thirds of the minority nationality population. Helping minority nationalities create, improve, and reform written languages is an arduous and urgent task. The Central People's Government has always attached great importance to the work of assisting minority nationalities in creating, improving, and reforming written languages. Over the past few years, under the leadership and assistance of the central and relevant local Party and government organs, and with the efforts of language workers and the help of Soviet experts, we have conducted some investigations and research on minority nationality languages, trained a group of cadres, helped several nationalities formulate writing schemes, and accumulated some experience in our work. The work in this area has been successful.

Wu Yuzhang said: The vast majority of the population of various minority nationalities in our country live in rural areas, and like the Han areas, most of these areas have also launched a high tide of agricultural cooperativization. However, in many of our minority nationality areas, due to the lack of their own national script, it is difficult to find literate workers and accountants in their agricultural producers' cooperatives, which affects the development of the cooperatives. Because the work of helping minority nationalities create written languages has not kept up with practical needs, many minority nationality areas have also encountered great difficulties in developing school education. All this fully demonstrates that the task of helping minority nationalities create written languages is very urgent. It is an important part of the Party's tasks on the national question during the transitional period. If we do not actively carry out this work, it will seriously affect the popularization and improvement of minority nationality culture and education, and hinder the smooth development of socialist construction and transformation in minority nationality areas. Therefore, in the future, we must adopt a more active but still steady approach to helping minority nationalities create written languages. The investigation and research work on minority nationality languages should be organized extensively with existing forces, scientific discussions should be held more frequently, and comprehensive plans should be drawn up to study the overall plan for helping minority nationalities create and improve written languages in accordance with the spirit of strengthening leadership. We should strive to help nationalities that do not yet have written languages to have their own national scripts within the next few years. Wu Yuzhang said: While requesting help in creating or improving their national scripts, the people of various minority nationalities also universally request to learn the Han language and Chinese characters. We must adopt a warm and welcoming attitude towards their request and try our best to meet their needs and actively help them learn the Han language and Chinese characters.

He also said that ethnic language work is a broad mass work, and all relevant cultural and educational departments, leaders of various nationalities, and intellectuals should actively participate in this work.

At today's meeting, Fu Maoji, Director of the Minority Language Research Group of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also gave a report on "The Situation and Problems in Helping Minority Nationalities Create, Improve and Reform Written Languages," and Ma Xueliang, Deputy Director of the Department of Languages of the Central Institute for Nationalities, and Lu Niansu, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Course of the Central Institute for Nationalities, gave reports on the teaching situation and experience of languages at the Central Institute for Nationalities.

    民族语文科学讨论会在京开幕
    新华社六日讯　中国科学院语言研究所和中央民族学院共同召开的民族语文科学讨论会今天上午在北京开幕。出席讨论会的有：有关省的民族事务委员会、教育厅、各民族学院和自治区、自治州以及有关的出版社、民族语文研究机构的负责人和代表和民族语文科学工作者等共一百六十多人。
    中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章和中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任刘春、中国科学院副院长张稼夫、国务院文教总顾问马里采夫、中国科学院语言研究所和中央民族学院顾问谢尔裘琴科都参加了会议。参加会议的还有中央人民政府各文教部门和北京各高等学校和科学研究机关的代表。
    中国科学院哲学社会科学部副主任潘梓年在会上致开幕词。他说：这次举行的民族语文科学讨论会是要了解民族语言工作的情况，交流民族语言工作的经验，交换意见，讨论怎样把帮助少数民族创造、改进和改革文字的工作做得更好，以促进少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化的建设事业。他说，像这样讨论有关少数民族语言文字的会议在中国科学界还是第一次，是中国少数民族和中国科学界的一件大事，也是中国社会主义建设事业中的一件大事。
    吴玉章在会上讲了话。他说：我国的少数民族中没有文字或没有通用文字的民族，大约占少数民族人口的三分之二。帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字，是一项艰巨和迫切的任务。中央人民政府对于帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的工作一向是十分重视的。几年来，在中央和有关地方党政机关的领导和帮助下，由于语文工作同志的努力和苏联专家的帮助，我们在少数民族语文工作上，进行了一些调查研究，培养了一批干部，帮助几个民族拟定了文字方案，在工作中也积累了一些经验，这方面的工作是有成绩的。
    吴玉章说：我国各少数民族的绝大多数人口都居住在农村，其中大部分地区和汉族地区一样也已经掀起了农业合作化的高潮。但是，我们有许多少数民族地区，由于没有本民族的文字，在他们的农业生产合作社中找不到识字的工作人员和会计人员，影响了合作社的发展。由于帮助少数民族创立文字的工作赶不上实际需要，许多少数民族地区在发展学校教育的事业上也遇到了很大的困难。这些都充分地说明了帮助少数民族创立文字的任务是十分迫切的。它是过渡时期党在民族问题方面的任务中的一项重要内容，如果我们不积极地进行这一工作，就会严重地影响少数民族文化教育的普及和提高，并妨碍少数民族地区社会主义建设和改造事业的顺利发展。因此，今后对于帮助少数民族创立文字的工作，必须采取比过去更为积极但仍应是稳步前进的方针。对于少数民族语言的调查研究工作应该组织现有力量广泛地进行，科学讨论会可以多开，应该根据全面规划、加强领导的精神，着手研究帮助少数民族创立和改进文字的通盘计划，争取在今后几年之内，帮助尚无文字的民族，都能有自己民族的文字。吴玉章说：各少数民族人民在要求帮助创立或改进本民族文字的同时，也普遍要求学习汉语汉文。对他们的这种要求必须采取热情欢迎的态度，并应尽量满足他们的要求，积极帮助他们学习汉语汉文。
    他还说，民族语文工作是一件广泛的群众性的工作，各有关的文教部门和各民族的领袖人物和知识分子都应该积极参加这一工作。
    今天的会议，还听了中国科学院语言研究所少数民族语文研究组主任傅懋勣作的“帮助少数民族创立、改进和改革文字工作的情况和问题”的报告，以及中央民族学院语文系副主任马学良、中央民族学院预科副主任卢念苏所作的关于中央民族学院语文教学情况和经验方面的报告。
