    Local Industry Must Actively Support the Cooperative Movement
    He Xin
    The great development of the national agricultural cooperative movement has presented local industry with an urgent new task. It requires local industrial enterprises to supply agriculture with more, better, and cheaper new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and chemical fertilizers, and to vigorously support the agricultural cooperative movement. Precisely because of this, workers' newspapers and newspapers aimed primarily at worker readers should mobilize the masses of workers and staff in local industrial sectors to exert greater enthusiasm and creativity, give full play to the potential of their enterprises, and manufacture a large number of high-quality, low-priced new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and chemical fertilizers. In this regard, the Shijiazhuang Daily has made considerable efforts.
    For more than a month, the Shijiazhuang Daily has vigorously publicized the importance and urgency of industry supporting the agricultural cooperative movement, repeatedly explaining that local industry and urban handicrafts must serve the rural economy and vigorously support agricultural cooperation and agricultural production. During this period, the Shijiazhuang Daily successively published editorials, special articles, and articles written by some factory leaders to explain the principle of mutual support and mutual development between industry and agriculture, and to explain the new demands that cooperation has placed on industrial production. The newspaper pointed out that next year, rural areas across the country will need more than fifty times the number of coal-fired mobile steam engines (a type of steam-powered engine used for irrigation and driving machines such as grinders and cotton gins) manufactured in Shijiazhuang this year, while the current level of industrial production is far from meeting the needs of farmers in various regions. Therefore, the newspaper called on the industrial sector, especially the local industrial sector, to catch up quickly, do its best to meet and support the urgent demands of agriculture. While expounding these principles, the Shijiazhuang Daily reported on the efforts of the workers and staff of many factories to support the agricultural cooperative movement, using local examples to encourage the workers' production enthusiasm. For example, in less than a month, from November 14th to December 10th, there were more than thirty articles in the newspaper about industry supporting agricultural cooperation. Among these articles, some reported on the increased production and frugality and labor emulation campaigns launched by workers and staff in many local state-owned farm tool and pesticide factories in Shijiazhuang to support the cooperative movement; others reported on the enthusiastic response of workers and staff at the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory to the inter-factory competition initiative proposed by workers and staff at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to support agricultural cooperation.
    In order to better leverage the role of the industrial sector in supporting agricultural cooperation, the Shijiazhuang Daily focused on the issue of tapping the potential of local industrial production and carried out publicity. In addition to elaborating on the possibility and methods of improving production in local industry in commentaries, the newspaper also reported that seven units in Shijiazhuang's machine and iron industry have begun to organize collaborative production in order to produce more and better agricultural machinery. Using this method, the output of coal-fired mobile steam engines in Shijiazhuang next year will increase seven times compared to the actual production of the Power Machinery Factory this year, and the output of double-wheeled double-blade plows will increase by 80 percent. Through these reports, the newspaper helped the industrial sector recognize where the production potential lies and how to tap it.
    In its mobilization of local industry to support agriculture, the Shijiazhuang Daily also paid attention to using existing good experiences to promote work. The article "How the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory Publicizes and Implements the Policy of Local Industry Serving the Rural Economy," published in the name of the Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, specifically introduced how the Party organization of the Power Machinery Factory conducted propaganda and education targeting the ideological situation and production realities of the factory's workers and staff, so that the workers and staff could recognize the role of the agricultural machinery they produce in agricultural production and the cooperative movement, and recognize its role in encouraging farmers to participate in cooperatives and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. This article not only affirmed the working experience of the Party organization of the Power Machinery Factory, but also provided Party organizations in other local industrial enterprises with a method of carrying out political and ideological work in the new situation of the cooperative movement.
    Now, the great mass socialist revolution movement of agricultural cooperation is developing rapidly. While mobilizing workers to complete and overfulfill industrial production tasks, workers' newspapers and city newspapers should also pay attention to conducting propaganda on agricultural cooperation and the worker-peasant alliance, so that the broad masses of workers and staff understand the urgent demands that the agricultural cooperative movement puts on the industrial sector and the working class, and actively work hard and produce hard to support cooperation. These practices of the Shijiazhuang Daily can be used as a reference for newspapers in various regions.

    地方工业必须积极支援合作化运动
    何辛
    全国农业合作化运动的大发展，向地方工业提出了一个迫切的新任务。它要求地方工业企业供应农业以更多更好更便宜的新式农具、农业机器和化学肥料，大力支援农业合作化运动。正是因为这样，工人报纸和以工人读者为主要对象的报纸，就应当动员地方工业部门的职工群众发挥更高的积极性和创造性，充分发挥本企业的潜力，制造出大量质量好、价格低的新式农具、农业机器和化学肥料。在这方面，石家庄日报已做了不少的努力。
    一个多月来，石家庄日报大力宣传了工业必须支援农业合作化运动的重要性和迫切性，反复地解释了地方工业和城市手工业必须为农村经济服务，必须大力支援农业合作化和农业生产的方针。在这期间，石家庄日报先后发表了社论、专文和一些工厂领导人员所写的文章，来说明工业和农业互相支援和互相得到发展的道理，说明合作化对工业生产所提出的新的要求。报纸曾指出，明年各地农村对石家庄市制造的锅驼机（一种用来灌溉和带动机器磨和轧花机等的蒸汽动力机）的需要数量，超过今年全部生产的五十倍，而目前工业生产的水平却远远赶不上各地农民的要求。报纸因此号召工业部门首先是地方工业部门，迅速地赶上去，尽最大的力量，来满足和支持农业的迫切要求。在阐述这些道理的同时，石家庄日报反映了许多工厂的工人群众支援农业合作化运动的情况，运用当地事例来鼓舞工人群众的生产热情。例如，报纸上有关工业支援农业合作化的稿件，在十一月十四日到十二月十日不到一个月内，一共有三十多篇。在这些稿件中，有的报道了石家庄市许多地方国营农具和农药工厂职工为支援合作化运动而展开的增产节约和劳动竞赛运动；有的报道了石家庄动力机械厂职工热烈响应北京农业机械厂职工提出的支援农业合作化的厂际竞赛倡议的情况。
    为了更好地发挥工业部门在支援农业合作化中的作用，石家庄日报曾抓住发掘地方工业生产潜力的问题，进行了宣传。这个报纸除在评论中阐述了地方工业提高生产的可能性和提高生产的方法外，还报道了石家庄市机铁工业中的七个单位，为了生产更多更好的农业机器，开始组织了协作生产。用这种方法，明年石家庄市锅驼机的产量，将比今年动力机械厂实际生产的增加七倍，双轮双铧犁增加百分之八十。通过这些报道，报纸就帮助工业部门认识到生产潜力在什么地方，认识到应该怎样挖掘生产潜力。
    石家庄日报在动员地方工业支援农业的宣传中，还注意运用现有的良好经验来推动工作。以中共石家庄市委宣传部名义发表所写的“石家庄动力机械厂怎样宣传贯彻地方工业为农村经济服务的方针”一文，就具体地介绍了动力机械厂的党组织怎样针对本厂职工的思想情况和生产实际进行宣传教育，使职工认清自己生产的农业机器对农业生产和合作化运动的作用，认清它对于鼓励农民参加合作社的积极性，和促进农业的社会主义改造运动的作用。这篇文章不只是肯定了动力机械厂党组织的工作经验，而且向其他地方工业企业中的党组织，提供了在合作化运动的新形势下进行政治思想工作的一个方法。
    现在，农业合作化这一伟大的群众社会主义革命运动，正在很快地向前发展着。工人报纸和城市报纸在动员工人完成和提前完成工业生产任务的同时，就还应该注意进行农业合作化和工农联盟的宣传，使广大职工了解农业合作化运动向工业部门和工人阶级提出的迫切要求，并积极地为支援合作化而努力生产努力工作。石家庄日报的这些作法，可以供各地报纸参考。
