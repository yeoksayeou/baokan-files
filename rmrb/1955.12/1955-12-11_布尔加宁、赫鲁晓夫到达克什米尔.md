Xinhua News Agency, Srinagar, December 10th: According to TASS, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Khrushchev, along with their entourage, arrived in Kashmir on December 9th, after a one-day visit to Jaipur on December 8th. Kashmir is located in the northernmost part of India, in a valley between the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush mountains, bordered on the north by the Pamir foothills.

Greeting the guests at the airport were Yuvaraj Karan Singh, the head of Kashmir State, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, the Prime Minister of Kashmir, ministers of various departments of the Kashmir government, and senior government officials.

After the head of state introduced the officials to the guests, he delivered a speech welcoming Bulganin and Khrushchev. Bulganin delivered a reply through a loudspeaker.

Bulganin said that India is a country with great potential, and the Indian people harbor a desire to build a new India with strong economic power.

Our trip to India has proven to be very beneficial to us. We must frankly say that our original concept of India was very inadequate. Thanks to the opportunity kindly given to us, we have traveled throughout the southern and central parts of India. However, without visiting the northern part of this country, it would be impossible for us to have a comprehensive understanding of India.

Bulganin said that we are very interested in this trip to Kashmir because Kashmir's unique natural environment, the rich indigenous culture of its various ethnic groups, and its folk handicrafts have made Kashmir famous throughout the world. As representatives of the Soviet people, we are interested in the trip to Kashmir also because Kashmir is adjacent to our country. In the past, we have always had large-scale trade relations with Kashmir. We are willing to take advantage of our stay in Kashmir to understand the living habits of the Kashmiri people, their rich indigenous culture, and their achievements.

After a friendly conversation between the guests and those who came to welcome them at a reception specially set up by the government at the airport, they rode in a long convoy of cars to the city. Farmers from nearby villages cheered the guests along the way. Throughout the road leading to the city, in the suburbs and in the city center, arches and long banners were erected everywhere, with slogans such as "Long Live Indian-Soviet Friendship!" "We welcome our great neighbors!" "Indians and Russians are brothers!"

The arrival of the Soviet leaders in Kashmir was celebrated by the 200,000 residents of Srinagar as a festival, and they all came to the streets to express their welcome. The fronts of the houses on the embankment were not only decorated with flags and slogans, but also with famous Kashmiri handicrafts: carpets, silks, scarves, embroideries, lacquered wood, paper handicrafts and silverware. Every craftsman displayed his creations in the window of his house, at the entrance of his workshop, or right on the street. In the evening, the guests watched fireworks and a dazzling display of lights in Srinagar, which were set off to welcome them, from their residence.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫到达克什米尔
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社斯利那加讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫以及他们的随行人员在十二月八日到达斋浦尔访问一天后，已经在九日乘飞机从斋浦尔到达克什米尔。克什米尔在印度最北部，位于喜马拉雅山和兴都库什山之间的山谷中，北面以帕米尔的小山为界。
    在机场欢迎客人的有克什米尔邦长尤瓦拉吉·卡兰·辛格、克什米尔总理巴克希·吴拉姆·穆罕默德、克什米尔政府各部部长和政府高级官员。
    邦长在介绍官员们同客人们见面之后，发表了欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的讲话。布尔加宁在扩音器前发表了答词。
    布尔加宁说，印度是一个具有巨大潜力的国家，印度人民抱着一个愿望，就是建设一个新的、具有强大经济力量的印度。
    我们在印度的旅行已经证明对我们是非常有益的。我们必须坦白地说，我们原来对印度的概念是很不充分的。感谢这次亲切地给我们的机会，我们走遍了印度的整个南部和中部。但是，要是不访问这个国家的北部的话，我们是不可能对印度有一个全面的概念的。
    布尔加宁说，我们对这次克什米尔之行很感兴趣，是因为克什米尔的独特的天然环境、它的各族人民的丰富的固有文化和它的民间手工艺已经使克什米尔驰名于全世界。作为苏联人民代表的我们，对克什米尔之行感到兴趣，还因为克什米尔邻近我国。过去我们一向同克什米尔是有大规模的贸易关系的。我们愿意利用我们在克什米尔逗留的时候，来了解克什米尔人民的生活习惯，他们的丰富的固有文化和他们的成就。
    客人们和前往欢迎的人员在机场上政府特设的招待处进行了友好的交谈以后，分乘一长列汽车驶往市内。附近村庄的农民对客人们夹道欢呼。在通往市内的整条道路上、在近郊和市中心的街道上，到处都扎着牌楼和长幅彩旗，上面写着“印度—苏联友谊万岁！”“我们欢迎我们伟大的邻居！”“印度人和俄国人是兄弟！”等标语。
    苏联领袖们到达克什米尔这件事是被斯利那加的二十万居民当作节日来庆祝的，他们都到街上来表示欢迎。堤岸上的房屋的前面不仅装饰着旗帜和标语，而且还有著名的克什米尔的手工艺品：地毯、丝织品、围巾、刺绣、木漆器、纸制手工艺品和银制品。每一个手艺人都在他家里的窗口上、他的作坊的入口处或者就在街道上展出了他的创造品。晚上，客人们从他们的住所观看了在斯利那加为欢迎他们所放的焰火以及灯火辉煌的景象。
