    Prime Minister Grotewohl Delivers Farewell Speech
    Now that we are about to leave your great and beautiful country, our hearts remain deeply attached to your nation. Even before we set foot on your soil, we held the brave Chinese people in high esteem. During our stay in China, we have come to love you even more. Our farewell is not a departure to separate ways, but rather to work together in our respective roles, in a spirit of full solidarity, for our common great cause.
    We will return to our homeland with very profound impressions. We have gained much inspiration on how to apply your rich experiences in our work. We thank you for everything, especially for your far-sighted, energetic, courageous, and unwavering defense of the cause of peace in Asia. Peace is indivisible, and therefore your struggle for peace, your determination to fight against aggression and national oppression, is a great assistance to us in Europe in opposing the same predatory imperialist forces. We are convinced that through our visit, through the conclusion of the "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation," and through the other agreements we have reached, the brotherly friendship that connects the people and nations of our two countries has been made even more solid and unbreakable.
    Here, we have seen the immense possibilities for prosperity and progress that a nation's people have once they are freed from foreign rule and domestic exploitation. We also clearly understand how difficult it is for certain imperialist exploiters to accept the fact that the great and wealthy China is no longer subject to colonial exploitation and no longer open to colonial exploiters.
    We are convinced that the people of Asian countries who are shaking off the shackles of foreign rule, or who have already done so, will draw strength from your great example of struggle and victory, enabling them to achieve victory in their own struggles as well.
    Our wonderful task is to return to the German Democratic Republic and tell our people about the abundant examples of this friendly solidarity, which will inspire our people to complete the enormous tasks of the new Second Five-Year Plan that is about to begin. Through the Second Five-Year Plan, our national economy can rise to provide even greater economic assistance than it does now, and to conduct peaceful trade with all peace-loving people on the basis of equality, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and mutual benefit.
    Here, we express our gratitude and respect to the entire Chinese people, especially to the hard-working, hospitable, and kind people of your great nation's capital, the citizens of Beijing.

    格罗提渥总理发表的告别演说
    现在我们就要离开你们伟大而美丽的祖国，可是我们的心却仍然非常留恋你们的国家，在我们还没有踏进你们的国土以前，我们就非常尊重勇敢的中国人民，而在我们停留在中国的期间，更懂得了热爱你们。我们向你们告别，并不是为了各奔一方，而是为了在各自的岗位上，在充分团结的精神中，共同为我们的伟大事业而努力。
    我们将带着非常深刻的印象回到我们的祖国。我们对于如何在我们的工作中运用你们的丰富经验已经得到很多启发。我们感谢你们的一切，特别是要感谢你们在亚洲这样深谋远虑，这样有魄力地、勇敢而坚定地保卫着和平的事业。和平是不可分割的，因此你们争取和平的斗争，你们反对侵略，反对民族压迫的战斗决心，对我们在欧洲反对同样的掠夺成性的帝国主义势力，是一个巨大的援助。我们深信，通过我们的访问，通过“友好合作条约”的缔结和通过我们所达成的其他协议，使得联系我们两国人民和国家的兄弟般的友谊更牢固不可破了。
    我们在你们这里看到，一个国家的人民，在摆脱了外国的统治和国内的剥削以后，将具有多么大的兴盛和进步的可能性。我们同样也很清楚地了解，某些帝国主义剥削者是如何地难于同意伟大而富饶的中国不再屈服于殖民剥削，不再为殖民剥削者开放的事实。
    我们深信，正在摆脱外国统治的束缚，或者甚至早已摆脱这种束缚的亚洲各国人民，都会从你们的斗争和胜利的伟大范例中汲取力量，使他们的斗争也获得胜利。
    我们的美好的任务，就是回到德意志民主共和国以后，把这种友好团结的大量的例证，告诉我们的人民，这将鼓舞我国人民去完成即将开始的新的第二个五年计划的巨大任务。通过第二个五年计划，我国的国民经济可以高涨到提供比现在更大的经济援助，并且和所有爱好和平的人民，在平等、不干涉他国内政和互利的基础上进行和平贸易。
    我们在此向全中国人民，特别是向你们伟大国家的首都的勤劳、好客、和善的人民，向北京的市民表示感谢和敬意。
