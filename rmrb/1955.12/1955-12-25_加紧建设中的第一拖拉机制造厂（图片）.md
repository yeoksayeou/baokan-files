In order to supply agricultural production with modern technical equipment, construction of the First Tractor Factory, newly built during our country's First Five-Year Plan, commenced on September 15th of this year. Originally scheduled for completion in 1959, the factory’s completion is to be expedited due to the rapid development of the agricultural collectivization movement nationwide. The factory is designed with a capacity of producing 15,000 54-horsepower tractors annually, capable of cultivating approximately 4.5 million mu of land each year. In addition to building this factory, we are also planning to construct a Second Tractor Factory and a Combine Harvester Factory.

    The first pillar of the auxiliary workshop of the First Tractor Factory has already been erected.
    In the metal structure processing plant, the steel beams for the workshop have been fitted and are ready to be transported to the site for installation.
    To strive for early completion of the factory, the greenhouses needed for winter construction have been built.
    Valiant soldiers on the battlefield, pioneers of labor on the construction site. Demobilized soldiers are a powerful labor force in the factory construction project.
    These young women came here from Tianjin to participate in the factory construction project. They are a welding team in the precast reinforced concrete component factory, and their work is no less than that of men because they are young women.
    The construction project of the First Tractor Factory adopts the Soviet advanced "integrated hoisting method," which not only improves the utilization rate of machinery and reduces physical labor, but also accelerates the progress of the project. This is a large auxiliary workshop hoisting project.
    Members of the Ju Gao Lin hoisting team of the mechanical construction team discuss issues of ensuring quality and paying attention to safety at the pre-shift meeting.
    During the factory construction project, a large number of youth shock brigades emerged. This is a photo of the members of the Wang A Mao group, which was named a youth shock brigade on the eve of the official hoisting of the factory building, studying the project task list.
    The construction project of the First Tractor Factory receives comprehensive assistance from Soviet experts. This is Soviet expert Alekseyev (right) working with our technical personnel.
    Farmers who have relied on an old cow and a wooden plow for generations to cultivate the land come to the construction site of the First Tractor Factory with excitement. Farmers and workers encourage each other. The workers express that they will speed up construction and strive to send tractors to the fields as soon as possible. The farmers express their determination to take the path of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and sell more grain and cash crops to the state to support socialist industrialization.

    为了供应农业生产以现代化的技术装备，在我国第一个五年计划期间新建的第一拖拉机制造厂的建厂工程已经在今年九月十五日开工了。这个厂原定一九五九年建成，由于目前全国范围内的农业合作化运动的迅速发展，将要提前完成建厂任务。这个厂的设计能力为年产五四马力的拖拉机一五、○○○台，每年生产的拖拉机约可耕地四、五○○万亩。除了修建这个厂，我们还要筹建第二拖拉机制造厂和联合收割机制造厂。

    第一拖拉机制造厂辅助车间的第一根柱子已经竖立起来了。
    在金属结构加工厂，已经把车间钢梁配好，正准备运到现场去安装。
    为了争取提前完成建厂任务，为冬季施工所需要的暖棚已经盖好。
    在战场上是英勇的战士，在工地上是劳动的先锋。转业军人是建厂工程中强有力的劳动大军。
    这几位年轻的姑娘是从天津来到这里参加建厂工程的。她们是钢筋混凝土预制构件厂里的电焊小组，她们的劳动并不因为是青年妇女而比男子差。
    第一拖拉机制造厂的建厂工程，采用了苏联先进的“综合吊装法”，不仅提高了机械使用率，减轻了体力劳动，而且加快了工程的进度。这是巨大的辅助车间的吊装工程。
    机械施工队居高林起重小组的组员们在班前会上讨论保证质量，注意安全的问题。
    在建厂工程中，涌现出大批青年突击队。这是在厂房建筑正式吊装前夕被命名为青年突击队的王阿毛小组的组员们，正在研究工程任务单。
    第一拖拉机制造厂的建厂工程得到苏联专家全面的援助。这是苏联专家阿列克谢也夫（右）同我国技术人员在一起研究工作。
    世世代代靠着一头老牛和一把木犁耕地的农民，怀着兴奋的心情来到第一拖拉机制造厂工地参观，农民和工人互相勉励，工人们表示加紧建设，争取早日把拖拉机送到田野上去；农民们表示坚决走农业合作化、机械化的道路，把更多的粮食和经济作物卖给国家，支援社会主义工业化。
