The national supply and marketing cooperative system and state purchasing departments have already achieved considerable success in purchasing cotton, hemp, tobacco, and other products. By the end of November, five provinces and cities had successfully completed their cotton pre-purchase plans. The purchase of flue-cured tobacco had reached 61.49% of the annual purchase plan, and sun-cured tobacco had exceeded the pre-arranged plan. The purchase of hemp was also progressing rapidly, with the purchase quantity of hemp for sacks reaching 92% of the pre-arranged plan by mid-November.

The progress of purchasing cotton, hemp, and tobacco this year is faster than in previous years, but it still does not meet objective needs. Taking cotton purchase as an example, some provinces have completed their purchase plans ahead of schedule, but cotton farmers still have a considerable amount of commodity cotton to sell. The main reason for this phenomenon is that some regions and departments have underestimated this year's bumper harvest, and the purchase plan targets are set too low. Due to the development of the cooperative movement (more than 70% of farmers in many cotton-producing areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives), the commodity rate of cash crops has greatly increased compared with the past. It is necessary to increase the purchase plan accordingly to meet the requirements of farmers to sell cash crop products. Moreover, only in this way can it be guaranteed that farmers will be able to buy back enough means of production after selling cash crop products and expand agricultural production next year. Based on this situation, the state has decided to increase the annual purchase plan of 20.06 million dan of ginned cotton to 24.07 million dan; the purchase plans for hemp and tobacco will also be expanded accordingly based on the specific situation.

In order to complete the expanded purchase plan, the most important step is to overcome the blind optimism and slackness of some purchase staff. They believe: "This year is a bumper harvest of agricultural products, so we can just lie down and collect what we need without any effort." This attitude was already wrong when dealing with the original purchase plan, and it is even more wrong when dealing with the expanded purchase plan. In fact, wherever the purchasing staff has the above-mentioned wrong ideas and relaxes the purchasing work, it will be difficult to complete the established plan, and it will also encourage some wealthy farmers, especially rich peasants, to refuse to sell. Kang Chunsheng and Kang Zhengcai, rich peasants in Kangqiao Township, Poyang County, Jiangxi Province, harvested more than 320 jin of cotton but did not sell even one jin to the state; more than 30 rich peasant households in Huangrang Township, Xingan County, have been unwilling to sell cotton. Many farmers, seeing that the rich peasants were not selling cotton, coupled with the rumors and instigations of bad elements, were also unwilling to sell. Speculators also took the opportunity to engage in illegal activities. In October, 42 cases of speculators fraudulently purchasing flue-cured tobacco were discovered in the Weifang area of Shandong Province, with the amount of tobacco trafficked reaching more than 6,600 jin; in some areas, the list price and market price of tobacco were divorced due to the disruption of private merchants.

To complete the expanded purchase plan, it is necessary to investigate the situation of the technical crop products preserved by farmers clearly. One of the important reasons why the current purchase work lags behind the actual situation is that some purchase staff are ignorant of the true situation. They see that farmers have sold some cotton, but they do not conduct investigations and research, and they say: "The peak season for cotton purchase has passed, and farmers have nothing left." Some areas have even removed purchase points and prepared to end the purchase work. Do farmers really have no cotton to sell? According to a survey conducted in Genglou Township, Shen County, Shandong Province, in November, the proportion of cotton stored by the people to the output was: 9.47% for agricultural production cooperatives, 27.18% for mutual aid teams, and more than 50% for individual farmers. The suburbs of Shanghai have completed 143.5% of the cotton purchase plan, but cotton farmers still have 17% of the stored cotton. Purchase staff in various places must seriously investigate the actual yield, the amount already sold, and the current inventory of farmers' cash crops, break the confused idea that "farmers have no cotton to sell," accelerate the purchase speed, and complete the expanded purchase plan.

Some areas are currently clearing cotton pre-purchase contracts, which is necessary. However, clearing cotton pre-purchase contracts does not mean passively ending the purchase work, but should, through clearing the contracts, further investigate the actual output of cotton to better carry out the purchase work. Farmers must be given material supply preferences in accordance with the bonus method for excess sales of cotton beyond the pre-purchase contract; for individual cases where pre-purchase contracts cannot be fulfilled due to the impact of natural disasters, they must be realistically reduced.

In the process of expanding the purchase of cash crops, we must provide farmers with as much convenience as possible and oppose the bureaucratic style of "sitting and waiting." The Luoyang Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province has newly added 178 mobile purchase and supply teams to purchase cotton and supply goods on a circuit, which is very popular among farmers. The yield of hemp in some areas of our country is very large, but because production is scattered, much of it has not been purchased, which requires more in-depth and meticulous work to be carried out, additional mobile purchase teams to be set up, and purchases to be made in the production areas.

"Superior quality, superior price, pricing according to quality" is one of the important principles for purchasing cash crop products. Phenomena of suppressing grades and prices and raising grades and prices have occurred in some areas and must be corrected immediately. Inspection departments should frequently exchange experiences, strengthen the inspection and calibration of cash crops, and avoid or reduce the problem of inaccurate inspection grades.

At present, supply and marketing cooperatives feel great pressure in cotton processing and storage. Many supply and marketing cooperatives have the phenomenon of seed cotton backlog, which affects the continued purchase of cotton. An effective way to overcome this phenomenon is to further organize and utilize folk cotton gins, give full play to processing capacity, and achieve collection and ginning at the same time. Hebei Province can organize 32,000 manual cotton gins, but only 26,000 were organized by November; the number of manual cotton gins organized in Jiangsu Province accounts for only about half of the folk cotton gins. If idle cotton gins are organized and utilized, the phenomenon of seed cotton backlog can be greatly eliminated. For seed cotton left in the hands of cotton farmers, it must be processed in a planned manner, on the one hand, to facilitate farmers to save seeds, and on the other hand, to promote cotton farmers to sell more cotton to the state.

In the case of insufficient warehousing equipment, many supply and marketing cooperatives purchase cotton from agricultural production cooperatives, prepay part of the cotton purchase price, and the cotton is still kept by the cooperatives, this method should be promoted. At present, agricultural production cooperatives are carrying out autumn harvest distribution, and all regions that adopt the above method should hand over all the cotton purchase funds to the agricultural production cooperatives to avoid affecting the distribution of dividends to the members.

### 努力收购棉、麻、烟

    努力收购棉、麻、烟
    全国供销合作社系统和国家采购部门收购棉、麻、烟等的工作，已经取得了不小的成绩。到十一月底，棉花预购计划已有五个省、市胜利完成。烤烟已完成全年收购计划的百分之六十一点四九，晒烟已经超过预订计划。麻的收购进度也很快，麻袋用麻的收购数量，到十一月中旬已达预定计划的百分之九十二。
    今年收购棉、麻、烟的进度比往年快，但是还没有满足客观的需要。以棉花收购情况为例，有些省份已经提前完成了收购计划，但是棉农手里还有不少的商品棉需要出卖。造成这种现象的主要原因，是有些地区、部门对今年的丰收情况估计不足，收购计划指标订得偏低。由于合作化运动的发展（许多棉区有百分之七十以上的农民已经加入农业生产合作社），技术作物的商品率比以前大大增加了，必须相应地提高收购计划，才能满足农民出售技术作物产品的要求。而且，也只有这样，才能保证农民在出售技术作物产品以后，能够买回足够的生产资料，扩大明年的农业生产。国家根据这一情况，已经决定把全年收购二千零六十万担皮棉的计划增加为二千四百零七万担；麻、烟收购计划也将根据具体情况相应地扩大。
    为了完成扩大了的收购计划，最重要的环节是克服某些收购工作人员的盲目乐观和松劲自满情绪。他们认为：“今年农产品大丰收，不用费劲，躺着也能够把需要的东西收上来。”这种态度用来对待原来的收购计划已经是错误的，用来对待扩大了的收购计划就更加错误了。事实上，凡是收购工作人员有上面那些错误思想，放松了收购工作的地方，就很难完成既定的计划，并且会助长某些富裕农民特别是富农拒绝出售。江西鄱阳县康桥乡富农康春生、康正才收获三百二十多斤棉花，一斤都不卖给国家；新淦县黄壤乡有三十多户富农一直不愿意出卖棉花。许多农民看见富农不卖棉花，加上坏分子的造谣挑拨，他们也就不愿意卖了。投机商人也就乘机进行违法活动。山东潍坊地区十月份查获了四十二起投机商人骗购烤烟，贩烟数量达六千六百多斤；有些地区因为私商的扰乱，竟发生了烟的牌价和市价脱节的现象。
    要想完成扩大了的收购计划，就必须把农民保存的技术作物产品的情况调查清楚。当前收购工作落后于实际的重要原因之一是某些收购工作人员心中无数。他们看到农民卖了一些棉花，不作调查研究，就说：“收棉旺季已过，农民手里没啥了。”有些地区甚至已经撤掉收购点，准备结束收购工作。农民真的没有棉花可卖了吗？据山东省莘县耿楼乡十一月份的调查，民间存棉数量占产量的比例是：农业生产合作社的占百分之九点四七，互助组的占百分之二十七点一八，个体农民的占百分之五十以上。上海市郊区已经完成棉花收购计划百分之一百四十三点五，但是，棉农手中还有百分之十七的存棉。各地收购工作人员必须认真调查农民的技术作物的实际产量、已经出售的数量和现存量，打破“农民手里已经没有棉花可卖”的糊涂思想，加快收购速度，完成扩大了的收购计划。
    目前有些地区正在清理棉花预购合同，这是必要的。但是，清理棉花预购合同绝不意味着消极地结束收购工作，而应该通过清理合同，进一步调查清楚棉花的实际产量，以便更好地开展收购工作。对于棉农在预购合同以外多卖的棉花，必须按照超额奖励办法给予实物供应的优待；对于个别因自然灾害影响不能履行预购合同的，要实事求是地予以核减。
    在扩大收购技术作物的过程中，要尽量给农民以便利，反对“坐门等待”的官僚主义作风。河南省洛阳专区供销合作社新增加了一百七十八个流动收购供应小组，巡回收购棉花，供应货物，很受农民欢迎。我国有些地区麻的产量很大，但因为生产分散，还有很多没有收购起来，这就更加需要进行深入细致的工作，增设流动收购小组，深入产区收购。
    “优级优价，按质论价”，这是收购技术作物产品的重要原则之一。有些地区发生压级压价和抬级抬价的现象，必须立即加以纠正。检验部门应该经常交流经验，加强技术作物的检验和校对工作，避免或减少验级不准确的毛病。
    目前供销社在棉花加工、保管方面感到很大的压力。许多供销社都发生籽棉积压现象，影响棉花的继续收购。克服这种现象的有效办法是进一步组织和利用民间轧车，充分发挥加工能力，作到随收随轧。河北省可以组织人力轧车三万二千台，但到十一月份才组织了二万六千台；江苏省已组织起来的人力轧车只占民间轧车的一半左右。如果把闲置的轧车组织和利用起来，就可以大大消除籽棉积压现象。对于棉农手中留下的种棉，必须有计划地组织加工，一方面便于农民留种，另一方面也可以促使棉农把更多的棉花卖给国家。
    在仓储设备不足的情况下，许多供销社向农业生产合作社收购棉花，预付一部分购棉款，棉花仍由合作社代为保管，这种办法应该提倡。目前农业生产合作社正在进行秋收分配，凡是采用上述办法的地区，应该把购棉款项全部交给农业生产合作社，以免影响社员分红。
