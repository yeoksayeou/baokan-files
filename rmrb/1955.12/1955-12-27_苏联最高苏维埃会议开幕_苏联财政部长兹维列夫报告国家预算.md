    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th: TASS reports that Soviet Finance Minister Zverev delivered a report on the 1956 Soviet National Budget and the implementation of the 1954 Soviet National Budget at the fourth session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the morning of December 26th. In his report, he cited vivid examples to illustrate the further development of the Soviet state's economy and culture.
    Zverev said that according to preliminary statistics, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1955 increased by 12 percent compared to 1954, greatly exceeding the level stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Achievements have been made in technological progress, and the production of many new machines has been mastered. New industrial enterprises have also been built in various regions of the country, and huge power stations have been built or are under construction. The output of daily necessities has increased, labor productivity has improved, and product costs have been reduced.
    Zverev pointed out that agriculture has further developed. In the past two years, the sown area in the Soviet Union has increased by 28 million hectares, mainly through the reclamation of wasteland.
    The material living standards of the working people have greatly improved. In 1955, expenditures on health, education, and other aspects reached 147 billion rubles, equivalent to more than 3.5 times the expenditures in 1940. The total area of housing built in cities and workers' residential areas is more than 30 million square meters. In addition, 500,000 new houses have been built in rural areas for collective farm members and rural intellectuals.
    1956 will be a year of further improvement in the Soviet economy and culture. Zverev pointed out that the revenue of the 1956 national budget is set at 591.9 billion rubles, and the expenditure is set at 568.8 billion rubles.
    The investment amount in 1956 will increase by about 15 percent compared to 1955. Investment will be used in heavy industry, agriculture, transportation, light industry, and housing construction. Investment in housing construction will increase by about 14 percent compared to 1955, and the area of completed housing will increase by 17 percent.
    Allocations for the development of science, culture, education, health, and social insurance will be greatly increased. This amount will exceed 161 billion rubles, which is 14.5 billion rubles more than in 1955.
    Education funding is 72.6 billion rubles, an increase of 4 billion rubles compared to 1955. The reason for increasing this amount is that the number of schools in the country has further increased, and the number of students has increased.
    In 1956, large sums of money will be allocated to train cadres, especially skilled industrial and agricultural cadres. For example, in 1956, labor reserve schools will train approximately 650,000 skilled workers, and technical schools will train approximately 100,000.
    In 1956, defense spending will be reduced. This expenditure is 102.5 billion rubles, while in 1955 it was 112.1 billion rubles.
    The reduction in military spending shows that the Soviet Union is demonstrating its concern for easing international tensions and ensuring peace and international security not only in words but also in actions.

    苏联财政部长兹维列夫报告国家预算
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联第四届最高苏维埃第四次会议十二月二十六日上午在莫斯科大克里姆林宫开幕。
    开幕会议由联盟院和民族院联合举行。出席会议的有从苏联各个地区来到莫斯科的苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    应苏联最高苏维埃的邀请到苏联访问的波兰和伊朗的议会代表团列席了会议。参加会议开幕式的还有莫斯科各企业的先进工人、文化和科学工作者、共产党组织和社会团体的代表、各国驻莫斯科的外交使节和苏联和外国的记者。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、别利雅耶夫、波斯伯洛夫在会议主席台上就座时，到会者报以热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    会议在苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席沃尔科夫主持下开幕，并且一致通过了下列议程：
    一、关于一九五六年苏联国家预算和一九五四年苏联国家预算执行情况的报告；
    二、批准苏联最高苏维埃主席团的各项命令；
    三、关于苏联最高苏维埃同外国议会交换代表团的报告；
    四、关于苏联政府代表团访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗的报告。
    苏联财政部长兹维列夫接着在会上作了关于一九五六年苏联国家预算和一九五四年苏联国家预算执行情况的报告。
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联财政部长兹维列夫十二月二十六日上午在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议上作了关于一九五六年苏联国家预算和一九五四年苏联国家预算执行情况的报告，他在报告中举出了生动的例子来说明苏维埃国家经济和文化的进一步发展。
    兹维列夫说：根据初步统计：一九五五年苏联的工业总产值比一九五四年增加了百分之十二，大大超过了第五个五年计划所规定的水平。在技术进步方面取得了成就，掌握了许多新机器的生产。全国各地区还建造起新的工业企业、建成了或是正在建设巨大的电力站。日用品的产量增加了，劳动生产率提高了，产品成本降低了。
    兹维列夫指出，农业有了进一步的发展。最近两年中苏联的播种面积增加了二千八百万公顷，这主要是靠开垦荒地。
    劳动人民的物质生活水平大大提高了。一九五五年用在卫生、教育等方面的经费共达一千四百七十亿卢布，相当于一九四零年用在这方面的经费的三点五倍以上。在各城市和工人住宅区建造起来的住宅的总面积在三千万平方公尺以上。此外，在农村地区还为集体农庄庄员和农村知识分子建造了五十万栋新房屋。
    一九五六年将是苏联经济和文化进一步提高的一年。兹维列夫指出，一九五六年国家预算的收入定为五千九百一十九亿卢布，支出定为五千六百八十八亿卢布。
    一九五六年的投资额约比一九五五年增加百分之十五。投资将用在重工业、农业、运输业、轻工业、住宅建设各方面。对住宅建设的投资比一九五五年约增加百分之十四，而建成的住宅的面积将增加百分之十七。
    对发展科学、文化、教育、卫生、社会保险方面的拨款将大大增加。这笔款项将超过一千六百一十亿卢布，即比一九五五年多一百四十五亿卢布。
    教育经费为七百二十六亿卢布，即比一九五五年增加四十亿卢布。所以规定增加这笔款项是因为国内的学校数目进一步增多了，学生的数目增加了。
    一九五六年将拨出大笔款项来培养干部，特别是培养熟练的工农业干部。例如，一九五六年劳动后备学校将培养约六十五万熟练工人，技术学校将培养大约十万名。
    一九五六年国防经费将要减少。这笔经费为一千零二十五亿卢布，而一九五五年是一千一百二十一亿卢布。
    军费的减少说明，苏联不是在口头上，而是在行动上表现出关心缓和国际紧张局势、保证和平和国际安全。
