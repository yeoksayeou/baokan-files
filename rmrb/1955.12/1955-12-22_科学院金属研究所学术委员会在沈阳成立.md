The Academic Committee of the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held its inaugural meeting in Shenyang from December 12th to 19th. The Academic Committee of the Institute of Metal Research is composed of sixteen individuals with achievements in scientific research: Wang Yingwu, Qiu Yuchi, Li Xun, Wu Ziliang, He Yizhen, Tong Mingda, Shao Xianghua, Gao Jingyun, Sun Dehe, Zhang Zuomei, Zhang Peilin, Zhang Shouqing, Yang Shangzhuo, Ge Tingsui, Ye Zhupei, and Jin Shuliang. Among them are engineers from factories and mines, professors from universities, and senior researchers from scientific research institutions.

    The meeting reviewed the work plan of the Institute of Metal Research for 1956, discussed twelve academic reports, put forward opinions on the long-term development plan of the institute, and passed the thesis defenses for research interns' promotions.

    Regarding the work of the Institute of Metal Research, the meeting considered: Within three to five years, research should be conducted on steel, including smelting, processing, and physical properties; at the same time, research on refractory materials and other issues related to steel smelting should be strengthened.

    The meeting considered that since its establishment, the Institute of Metal Research has made many achievements in its work, such as conducting ore dressing experiments and quality and technical evaluations of refractory material raw materials for new iron and steel bases such as Daye and Baotou; and solving some scientific and technological problems raised in production for steel plants such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Fushun Steel. In the future, the Institute of Metal Research should further exert the collective leadership of the Academic Committee and the collective strength of scientists within the institute, comprehensively learn from the Soviet Union and absorb international advanced science and technology experience, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and closely connect with industrial departments and universities, working together to complete the glorious tasks given to scientific workers by the Party and the people.

    科学院金属研究所学术委员会在沈阳成立
    中国科学院金属研究所十二月十二日到十九日在沈阳举行了金属研究所学术委员会成立大会。金属研究所学术委员会由在科学研究方面有成就的王应梧、丘玉池、李薰、吴自良、何怡贞、佟明达、邵象华、高景云、孙德和、张作梅、张沛霖、张绶庆、杨尚灼、葛庭燧、叶渚沛、靳树梁等十六人组成，他们之中有的是厂矿的工程师，有的是高等学校的教授和科学研究机关的高级研究人员。
    这次会议审查了金属研究所一九五六年的工作计划，讨论了十二篇学术报告，对研究所长远发展的规划也提出了意见，并通过了研究实习员升级的论文答辩。
    关于金属研究所的工作，会议认为：要在三五年内进行钢铁方面，包括冶炼、加工和物理性能的研究；同时加强关于钢铁冶炼方面耐火材料等问题的研究。
    会议认为：金属研究所自建所以来在工作中曾取得许多成绩，如曾经为大冶、包头等新钢铁基地作选矿试验和耐火材料原料的质量评价及技术评价；并为鞍钢和抚顺等钢厂解决了生产中提出的一些科学技术问题。今后金属研究所要进一步发挥学术委员会的集体领导和所内科学家的集体力量，全面学习苏联和吸取国际先进科学和技术经验，在中国共产党的领导下，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，密切同产业部门和高等学校的联系，共同努力完成党和人民给予科学工作者的光荣任务。
