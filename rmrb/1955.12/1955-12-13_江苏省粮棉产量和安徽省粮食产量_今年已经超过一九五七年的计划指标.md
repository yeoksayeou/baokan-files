Jiangsu Province's grain and cotton output and Anhui Province's grain output this year have already exceeded the 1957 planned targets.

This year, Jiangsu Province achieved an all-around bumper harvest of grain and cotton, realizing the increased production targets set for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This year, the province's total grain output exceeded the 1957 planned target by 220 million jin, and the total cotton output exceeded the 1957 planned target by 1.28 million dan.

The reason why Jiangsu Province achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year is that the Party committees at all levels have grasped the leadership of agricultural production and correctly implemented the state's "three fix" policy for grain, as well as the development of the agricultural cooperative movement throughout the province. This year, 89 percent of the province's more than 35,000 old cooperatives increased production compared to last year. This year, various localities have gradually promoted the reform of production technology in accordance with local conditions. 1.2 million mu of early and mid-season rice were changed to late-season rice, resulting in an average increase of 100 jin per mu. Under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, the broad masses of peasants also carried out a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. This spring, 1.75 million laborers completed 120 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects. The cotton-producing areas throughout the province have also universally implemented technical measures such as close planting, pruning, and spraying phosphorus, ensuring the bumper harvest of cotton.

Currently, all parts of the province are grasping advanced models in conjunction with the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives and winter production work, summarizing the experience of increasing production, and carrying out the increased production plans for 1956 and 1957, striving for even greater bumper harvests.

Xinhua News Agency: Anhui Province's total grain output this year has exceeded the state-stipulated 1957 provincial grain production target by more than 3.6 billion jin.

Anhui Province is a historically well-known disaster area. After suffering unprecedented flooding last year, the state allocated more than 1 billion jin of grain to support disaster-stricken farmers to quickly restore production. In addition to the large-scale construction of the Huai River harnessing project and the renovation of the Yangtze River dikes, 280,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects were built throughout the province last winter and this spring. The province also actively carried out the agricultural cooperative movement, mobilizing farmers to further promote the three reforms of agricultural production (changing the proportion of summer and autumn harvests, changing to planting high-yield crops, water-resistant crops, and drought-resistant crops, and changing the habit of extensive planting and meager harvesting). The province expanded the planting area of summer-ripening crops and late-autumn crops by 17.45 million mu, and increased the planting and conversion of high-yield crops such as Victory No. 100 sweet potato and spring potato by more than 3.3 million mu. Double-cropping rice was promoted and planted in some areas along the Yangtze River and south of the Huai River. In the Huaibei area, where cultivation has always been extensive, the area of fertilization for summer-ripening crops alone increased by 16 million mu compared to last year. According to statistics from the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Department, this year the province increased grain production by 4.7 billion jin compared to the bumper harvest year of 1953, of which 2.7 billion jin of grain were increased due to the promotion of agricultural production reforms.

    江苏省粮棉产量和安徽省粮食产量
    今年已经超过一九五七年的计划指标
    今年江苏省的粮食、棉花获得全面丰收，提前实现了第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的增产指标。今年全省粮食总产量超过一九五七年计划指标二亿二千万斤，棉花总产量超过一九五七年计划指标一百二十八万担。
    江苏省今年粮食和棉花获得丰收，是因为各级党委抓紧了对农业生产的领导和正确贯彻执行了国家的粮食“三定”政策，以及全省农业合作化运动的发展。全省三万五千多个老社今年百分之八十九都比去年增产。各地今年都因地制宜地逐步推行了生产技术的改革工作。全省有一百二十万亩早、中稻改种晚稻，使每亩平均增产了一百斤。在各级党政机关的领导下，广大农民还同自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，今年春季就有一百七十五万民工，完成了一亿二千万公方的水利工程。全省各棉产区也普遍推行了密植、整枝、喷磷等技术措施，保证了棉花的丰收。
    现在，全省各地正在结合整顿农业生产合作社和冬季生产工作，抓紧先进典型，总结增产经验，进行一九五六年和一九五七年的增产规划，争取更大的丰收。　　　　（本报驻南京记者）
    安徽省今年粮食总产量已经超过国家规定的一九五七年全省粮食生产指标三十六亿多斤。
    安徽省在历史上是有名的灾区。去年遭受百年来没有过的大水以后，国家调拨了十亿多斤粮食支援灾区农民迅速恢复生产。除了大规模兴修治淮工程和整修长江堤防以外，去冬今春全省兴修小型农田水利工程二十八万处。全省还积极开展农业合作化运动，发动农民进一步推行农业生产三项改革（改变夏、秋两季收成的比重，改种高产作物、耐水作物和耐旱作物，改变广种薄收的习惯）。全省共扩大夏熟作物和晚秋作物播种面积一千七百四十五万亩，增种和改种高产作物胜利百号甘薯和春马铃薯三百三十多万亩。在长江两岸和淮河以南的部分地区推广种植了双季稻。在向来耕作粗放的淮北地区，仅夏熟作物的施肥面积就比去年增加了一千六百万亩。据安徽省农业部门统计，今年全省比丰收的一九五三年增产粮食四十七亿斤，其中由于推行农业生产改革而增产的粮食就有二十七亿斤。
