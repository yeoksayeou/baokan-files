Whole-industry public-private partnership is a high-level form of state capitalism and the primary method for transforming capitalist industry and commerce at present. All important private industrial and commercial sectors, with the exception of a portion of small enterprises that can take the path of cooperativization and a portion of consignment sales businesses that can directly transform into socialist commerce, must fundamentally transition to socialism through the form of whole-industry public-private partnership. Over the past few months, many important private industrial and commercial sectors have implemented whole-industry public-private partnership. Adopting the method of whole-industry public-private partnership for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has more advantages than processing orders, distribution and sales on commission, and individual public-private partnerships:

First, whole-industry public-private partnership is more conducive to implementing the state's policy of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, and further strengthens the planned nature of national economic development. The purpose of the state's policy of overall planning and comprehensive consideration is to rationally arrange the production and operation of various economic types and ensure the completion of state plans. The production of private industry is arranged through processing orders. Processing orders indirectly bring the production of private industry into the orbit of state plans, but the blindness of capitalist production cannot be completely restricted. Many enterprises that process orders often fail to complete state plans well and often fail to complete tasks on time, with assured quality and quantity. The situation is similar with commercial distribution and partial consignment sales. When individual enterprises implement public-private partnerships, while other enterprises retain processing orders, distribution, and consignment sales, the policy of overall planning and comprehensive consideration is not easy to fully implement. The implementation of whole-industry public-private partnership greatly changes these situations and makes it possible to directly incorporate every link of supply, production, and sales into state plans, establishing direct leadership by socialist elements throughout the entire industry. In this way, production can be better planned overall, ensuring the reliable completion of state plans.

Second, whole-industry public-private partnership is conducive to production reorganization and economic reorganization. Most of China's private enterprises are scattered, backward small and medium-sized enterprises. They must be organized and reorganized, merged, and adjusted in accordance with the principle of "large enterprises leading small enterprises, advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises" in order to leverage their production and operation capabilities and meet the needs of state plans. Reorganization work can only be carried out according to socialist principles in conjunction with whole-industry public-private partnership and under the direct leadership of socialist elements. The implementation of whole-industry public-private partnership can break down the boundaries between enterprises, allowing for the unified allocation and rational use of equipment, technology, capital, and manpower throughout the industry, and for reasonable adjustments to regional distribution, thereby changing the unbalanced state of production and operation in the industry and overcoming the contradictions between large and small, advanced and backward. In this way, potential can be tapped, and the production and operation level of the entire industry can be improved, fundamentally and gradually changing the scattered and backward situation of private industry and commerce, so that it can adapt to the needs of national construction and people's lives.

Third, whole-industry public-private partnership can save state funds and manpower. China's private industry and commerce have millions of households. If they were to implement public-private partnerships one by one, it would cause the dispersion and waste of state funds and cadre allocation. In socialist construction, state funds should mainly be used to develop heavy industry. Many private industrial and commercial households do not lack funds, and some even have surpluses. If the state were to invest additional funds, it would clearly be a waste and unnecessary. Some enterprises are not large in scale and do not have many employees. If the state were to dispatch cadres to each household, it would actually be a waste of manpower and increase the expenses of the enterprise. With the implementation of whole-industry partnerships, the state can make necessary investments with emphasis and allocate cadres in a concentrated manner. The manpower and financial resources saved in this way can be used to accelerate socialist construction.

Fourth, whole-industry public-private partnership can accelerate the progress of transformation work. China is about to enter the fourth year of its First Five-Year Plan. The semi-socialist cooperativization of agriculture will be basically completed in 1956. If the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce cannot adapt to the pace of socialist economic construction and the socialist transformation of the countryside, the blindness of capitalism will inevitably disrupt the national construction plan and the market. Private industry bears a large part of the production tasks for daily consumer goods, and private commerce bears a large part of the retail tasks for goods. If they are not transformed, the state cannot make overall plans and leverage their production and operation capabilities to timely meet the needs of the ever-increasing purchasing power of the people (especially after agricultural cooperativization enters its high tide, this need will grow rapidly). Whole-industry public-private partnership has developed precisely to adapt to this objective situation. From October 1955 to the present, more than 2,000 private industrial factories in major and medium-sized cities have implemented and approved the implementation of whole-industry public-private partnership. More than 3,000 private retail commercial stores have implemented and approved the implementation of whole-industry public-private partnership, greatly exceeding the progress of the past six years.

Fifth, whole-industry public-private partnership is a decisive step in gradually changing capitalist relations of production. Due to the increasing degree of planning in national economic development and the continuous growth of state and people's needs, the transformation of capitalist enterprises requires not only restricting their blindness, but also changing their relations of production and gradually removing the shackles on the development of productive forces. After the implementation of public-private partnerships in the entire industry, the boundaries between enterprises have been broken down, and profits can be calculated uniformly for the entire industry, rather than calculated household by household. In such circumstances, it is obviously unsuitable to continue using the "four-horse split" method to calculate profits household by household. It is necessary to adopt a fixed interest rate method, which allows capitalists to receive a fixed amount of dividends based on the specific conditions of each industry. The adoption of a fixed interest rate method guarantees the profits of private shares on the one hand, and further restricts the exploitation of capital on the other hand, further changing the relations of production in the enterprise. The state can then make certain necessary adjustments or relocations, reconstructions or expansions to the entire industry in accordance with the requirements of the state plan. At the same time, it can also improve varieties, specifications, manufacture new products, and rationally adjust commercial networks in accordance with the needs of the state plan. After the implementation of the fixed interest rate method, the exploitation of capitalists can be restricted to a certain level, which can greatly improve the labor enthusiasm of the working masses, further leverage the production and operation capabilities of enterprises, resolve the contradiction of increased production leading to increased exploitation, and fundamentally block all loopholes for capitalists to seek profit. The enterprise can then be managed according to socialist management methods. This also lays a solid foundation for ultimately changing the means of production of the enterprise into public ownership by the whole people.

Sixth, for capitalists, whole-industry public-private partnership universally brings them a bright future and prepares better conditions for their personal transformation. For the vast number of small and medium-sized industrialists and businesspeople, under the capitalist system in the past, they often suffered the pain of bankruptcy due to the result of "the big fish eat the small fish" and mutual infighting and mergers. During the socialist transformation process, many of them are still worried about their "enterprises being old," "the government not wanting them," and "having no future," believing that "socialism is good, but they have no share in it." Whole-industry public-private partnership clearly points out a bright road that is completely different from capitalism for them. Under this form of whole-industry public-private partnership, small and medium-sized enterprises also get the opportunity to be transformed, and they can also change their scattered and backward state under the principle of "large enterprises leading small enterprises, advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises" and enter socialism together. Although a small number of overly backward enterprises will be eliminated, this is necessary for the development of the entire national economy, but the employees of these enterprises will not suffer the threat of unemployment or bankruptcy. The state will properly arrange for them so that they can have better conditions to give play to their talents. Whole-industry public-private partnership also brings better conditions for every capitalist to learn and transform their thinking, which can change the situation in the past where some small and medium-sized entrepreneurs had fewer learning opportunities. After the implementation of whole-industry public-private partnership, under the direct leadership of the socialist economy, through the economic reorganization of the entire industry, through fixed interest rate measures, etc., the status of capitalists in the enterprise has been greatly changed, and their profit-seeking thinking has been fundamentally restricted, which lays a material foundation for their ideological transformation. In this way, on the one hand, from restricting their exploitation to eliminating their exploitation, gradually changing their thinking of relying on exploitation for a living and establishing the thinking of relying on labor for a living; on the other hand, cultivating and gradually strengthening their labor concept from work practice and exercising their work ability can enable them to obtain the glorious future of becoming a socialist worker.

In summary, adopting the form of whole-industry public-private partnership to further transform capitalist industry and commerce is an extremely necessary and important measure. At the same time, the transformation work has achieved great results in the past six years. Capitalist industry and commerce have basically been incorporated into the forms of processing orders, distribution, and consignment sales. Taking this major measure on this good foundation to further transform capitalist industry and commerce has also created fully favorable conditions. However, it must be seen that whole-industry public-private partnership is a complex and arduous task. It must be carried out in a planned and phased manner, in batches and in stages, on the basis of strengthening leadership and doing a good job in various preparatory works. At present, many provinces and cities, under the leadership of the Party committees and governments, have formulated plans for transforming capitalist industry and commerce based on the requirements of the transformation work and the specific conditions of various regions. Most regions will implement whole-industry public-private partnership in the main sectors of private industry and commerce within one or two years. Obviously, this will be a great victory in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    全行业公私合营的优越性
    管大同
    全行业公私合营是国家资本主义的高级形式，是目前改造资本主义工商业的主要形式。一切重要行业的私营工商业，除一部分小企业可以走合作化道路以及一部分代销商业可以直接转为社会主义商业外，基本上都要通过全行业公私合营的形式向社会主义过渡。几个月以来，已经有许多重要的私营工商业行业实行了全行业公私合营。对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造采取全行业公私合营的办法，较之加工订货、经销代销和个别实行公私合营具有更多的优越性：
    第一，全行业公私合营更有利于贯彻执行国家统筹兼顾的方针，进一步加强国民经济发展的计划性。国家采取统筹兼顾方针的目的就是为了合理地安排各种经济类型的生产和经营，保证国家计划的完成。对私营工业的生产，是通过加工订货来安排的。加工订货是间接地把私营工业的生产纳入国家计划轨道，资本主义生产的盲目性不能受到完全的限制；许多加工订货的企业，时常不能很好地完成国家的计划，时常不能按质按时按量完成任务。商业方面的经销和部分商品的代销，也是同样的情形。在个别企业实行公私合营，而另一部分企业保留加工订货、经销代销的情况下，统筹安排的方针就不容易全面贯彻执行。实行全行业的公私合营，就大大地改变了这些情况，就有可能把供应、生产和销售的每个环节都直接纳入国家计划，在整个行业中建立起社会主义成分的直接领导。这样，就可以更好地统筹安排生产，使国家计划的完成有了可靠的保证。
    第二，全行业公私合营有利于进行生产改组和经济改组。我国的私营企业多数是分散、落后的中小企业。必须把它们组织起来，依照“以大带小、以先进带落后”的原则进行联产、联营、合并、调整，才能发挥其生产经营能力，适应国家计划的需要。只有结合全行业的公私合营和在社会主义成分直接领导下，才能按照社会主义的原则来进行改组工作。实行全行业公私合营，就可以打破企业和企业之间的界限，可以对全行业的设备、技术、资金、人力作统一的调配和合理的使用，对地区分布也可以作合理的调整，从而改变行业中生产经营的不平衡状态，克服大小之间、先进和落后之间的矛盾。这样，就可以发挥潜力，提高整个行业的生产和经营水平，从根本上逐步改变私营工商业的分散落后情况，使之适应于国家建设和人民生活的需要。
    第三，全行业公私合营可以节约国家的资金和人力。我国私营工商业有数百万户，如果让它们一户一户地实行合营，就会造成国家资金和干部配备的分散和浪费。在社会主义建设中，国家的资金主要应当用来发展重工业。有许多私营工商业户资金原不缺乏，有的还有多余，如果国家再投入资金，那分明是浪费和不必要的。有些企业规模不大，人员不多，如果国家对每一户都要派遣干部，实际是浪费人力，并增加企业的开支。实行全行业合营，国家就可以有重点地作必要的投资，可以集中地配备干部，这样节省下来的人力、财力就可以用于加速社会主义的建设。
    第四，全行业公私合营可以加速改造工作的进度。我国将要进入第一个五年计划的第四个年度，农业的半社会主义合作化在一九五六年内基本上完成，对资本主义工商业的改造如果不能和社会主义经济建设和农村的社会主义改造的进度相适应，资本主义的盲目性就必然对国家建设计划和对市场发生破坏作用。私营工业负担很大一部分日用工业品的生产任务，私营商业负担很大一部分商品的零售任务，如果不对它们进行改造，国家就不能统筹规划，发挥它们的生产经营能力来及时地满足日益增长的人民购买力的需要（特别是在农业合作化进入高潮后，这种需要会增长很快）。全行业公私合营正是适应于这一客观形势而发展起来的。从一九五五年十月份到现在，各大中城市实行和批准实行全行业公私合营的私营工业有二千多家工厂，已经实行和批准实行全行业公私合营的私营零售商业有三千多户商店，大大超过了过去六年的进度。
    第五，全行业公私合营是逐步改变资本主义生产关系的一个具有决定性意义的步骤。由于国民经济发展的计划化程度的增加以及国家和人民需要的不断增长，对资本主义企业的改造就要求不仅是限制其盲目性，而且要改变它的生产关系，逐步解除对生产力发展的束缚。全行业实行公私合营以后，由于企业间的界限已经打破，就可以对整个行业的利润统一计算，不再逐户计算。在这样的情况下，再采取“四马分肥”的办法来逐户计算利润，显然是不适合了，必须采取定息的办法，按照各个行业的具体情况，使资本家得到定额的股息。采取定息办法一方面保证了私股的利润，另方面，进一步限制了资本的剥削，也进一步改变了企业的生产关系。国家就可以按照国家计划的要求来对全行业进行某些必要的调整或迁移，改建或扩建。同时，也可以按照国家计划的需要来改进品种、规格、制造新产品，和合理的调整商业网。实行定息的办法以后，就可以把资本家的剥削限制在一定的水平，因而就可以大大提高工人群众的劳动积极性，进一步发挥企业的生产、经营能力，解除了生产增加同时造成剥削增加的矛盾，并且从根本上堵塞了资本家唯利是图的一切漏洞。使企业可以按照社会主义的经营管理方法进行管理。这样也就为最后将企业的生产资料改变为全民所有制打下了巩固的基础。
      第六，对于资本家说来，全行业公私合营是给他们普遍地带来了光明的前途，给他们个人的改造准备了更好的条件。对于广大的中小工商业者来说，过去在资本主义制度下，他们往往由于“大鱼吃小鱼”和互相倾轧、吞并的结果而遭受到破产的痛苦。在社会主义改造过程中，他们之中也还有不少人在担心自己的“企业破旧”，“政府不要”，“没有前途”，认为“社会主义虽然好，但是自己没有分”。全行业公私合营就给他们明确地指出了一条和资本主义截然不同的光明道路。在全行业公私合营这一形式下，中小企业同样地得到了改造的机会，而且还可以在“以大带小、以先进带落后”的原则下改变他们的分散落后状态，一同进入社会主义。虽然会有少数过于落后的企业将被淘汰，这对整个国民经济发展来说是必要的，但是这些企业的从业人员不会遭受失业或破产的威胁，国家将妥善地安排他们，使他们能够有更好的条件来发挥才能。全行业公私合营也为每一个资本家带来了更好的学习和改造思想的条件，可以改变过去有些中小企业者学习机会较少的情况。全行业公私合营以后，在社会主义经济直接领导下，经过全行业的经济改组，经过定息的措施等，资本家在企业中的地位，就大大改变了，他们唯利是图的思想从根本上受到限制，这就为他们的思想改造奠定了物质基础。这样，一方面从限制他们的剥削到消灭他们的剥削，逐步改变其依靠剥削为生的思想，树立依靠劳动为生的思想；一方面再从工作实践中培养和逐步加强他们的劳动观念，锻炼他们的工作才能，就能够使他们获得作一个社会主义劳动者的光荣前途。
    综上所述，采取全行业公私合营形式来进一步地改造资本主义工商业，是一个极为必要的重大措施。同时，六年来改造工作已经取得很大成绩，资本主义工商业基本上已经纳入了加工订货、经销代销形式，在这个良好的基础上采取这一重大措施来进一步改造资本主义工商业，也已经具备了充分有利的条件。但是，必须看到，全行业公私合营是一件复杂、艰巨的工作，必须在加强领导和做好各项准备工作的基础上，做出全面的规划，有步骤地分批分期地进行。目前已经有许多省市在党委和政府的领导下，根据改造工作的要求和各地具体条件，做出了改造资本主义工商业的规划，大部分地区将在一两年内使私营工商业的主要行业实行全业公私合营。显然地，这将是对资本主义工商业改造工作上的一个很大胜利。
