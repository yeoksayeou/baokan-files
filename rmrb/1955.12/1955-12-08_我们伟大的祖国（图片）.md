    Our Great Motherland
    This year, the hunters of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, who live by hunting, have settled down in three Gaolu (villages). The local government built more than sixty new houses for them on the banks of the Nuomin River, so that they would no longer be attacked by wind and snow. Cadres of the Banner People's Committee welcomed the Oroqen hunters who moved into their new homes.
