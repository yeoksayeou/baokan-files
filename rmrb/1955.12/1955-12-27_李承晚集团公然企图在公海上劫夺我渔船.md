Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: The South Korean Syngman Rhee clique openly attempted to plunder our fishing boats on the high seas with naval vessels and opened fire on other Chinese fishing boats rushing to the rescue. Although the Syngman Rhee clique's attempt to plunder our fishing boats did not succeed, they still kidnapped two of our fishermen.

　　At 3:30 on December 25th, our fishing boat No. 51 was fishing in our usual fishing grounds on the high seas at latitude 34 degrees 15 minutes north and longitude 123 degrees 50 minutes east. The Syngman Rhee clique's navy forcibly boarded our fishing boat No. 51, kidnapped two of our fishermen, stationed four sailors on the boat, and then attempted to tow away our fishing boat No. 51. When other nearby fishing boats rushed to the rescue, the Syngman Rhee clique's naval vessels opened fire on our fishing boats. However, our rescuing fishing boats still bravely pursued them. Finally, the Syngman Rhee clique's naval vessels had to abandon our fishing boat No. 51 and fled in panic. Although our fishing fleet has returned safely, the two Chinese fishermen kidnapped by the Syngman Rhee clique have not yet been recovered. The four sailors from the Syngman Rhee clique stationed on our fishing boat No. 51 did not have time to escape and were brought back by our fishing fleet.

　　This act of armed provocation and piracy committed by the Syngman Rhee clique on the high seas has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people and will also arouse the full vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world.

    李承晚集团公然企图在公海上劫夺我渔船
    新华社二十六日讯　南朝鲜的李承晚集团公然企图在公海上以海军舰艇劫夺我国渔船，并且向赶往援救的我国其他渔船开火射击。李承晚集团劫夺我国渔船的企图虽未得逞，但是仍然掳走我国渔民两人。
    十二月二十五日三时三十分，我国五十一号渔船在北纬三十四度十五分东经一百二十三度五十分我经常捕鱼的公海上捕鱼。李承晚集团的海军竟强行登上我五十一号渔船，掳走我国渔民二人，并且在船上派驻水兵四人，然后企图将我五十一号渔船拖走。当我临近的其他渔船赶往援救时，李承晚集团的海军舰艇竟又向我渔船开火射击。但是，我驰援的渔船仍奋勇追赶。最后，李承晚集团的海军舰艇不得不放弃我五十一号渔船，仓皇逃逸。我捕鱼船队虽已全部安返，但是被李承晚集团掳去的两名我国渔民仍未追回。李承晚集团派驻在我五十一号渔船上的四名水兵未及逃走，已被我捕鱼船队带回。
    李承晚集团在公海上进行的这种武力挑衅和海盗行为，已经激起了中国人民的极大愤慨，同时也一定会引起全世界爱好和平人士的充分警惕。
