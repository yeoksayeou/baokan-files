For the Happiness of Humanity
——A Sideline Account of the 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference
　　Jian Yuan

　　At the 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference, sat Soviet microbiologists, the Professor of Microbiology from the University of Warsaw in Poland, Romanian virologists, the Director of the Scientific Department of the Razgrad Penicillin Factory under the Bulgarian People's Ministry of Public Health, faculty members from Choibalsan University in Mongolia, and a Vietnamese Doctor of Bacteriology. Also present were a Professor from the University of Tokyo in Japan, a Professor of Pathology from the University of Yangon in Myanmar, the Head of the Department of Pharmacy at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Indonesia, scientific workers from Korea, and scientific workers from Denmark. At the opening of the conference, the guests expressed their congratulations to their Chinese friends, stating that scientific research on antibiotics, and all scientific research, is for the happiness of mankind and requires international cooperation.

　　Facing guests from so many countries, Chinese scientific workers couldn't help but recall the "International Conference on Antibiotics" held in Warsaw, Poland, in February of this year. China sent a delegation to participate in that conference and presented three papers: "Penicillin Production - Trial Production Using White Corn Flour Instead of Lactose in Intermediate Factories," "Penicillin Production - Cultivation in 1,500-Gallon Fermentation Tanks Using Cottonseed Cake Instead of Corn Steep Liquor," and "Trial Production of Chlortetracycline in Intermediate Factories." Delegates from various countries were very interested in our work, paying particular attention to China's penicillin fermentation units. Poland and Czechoslovakia were willing to try using cottonseed cake. The Chinese delegation also gained a lot, bringing back valuable strains and learning many new methods and advanced experiences for manufacturing antibiotics.

　　Chinese scientific workers especially remember the specific help that international friends have given us in the development of China's antibiotics industry. Soviet expert G.M. Vasiliev suggested shortening the fermentation time and adopting the countercurrent extraction method for the penicillin production method at Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, thereby increasing production by about 33%. He also promoted the factory's compilation of operating procedures, gradually developing production management towards standardization. The study and application of the relationship between the developmental morphology and productivity of Penicillium was also Vasiliev's suggestion, further streamlining the scientific nature of penicillin production methods. Another Soviet expert, V.A. Zassasov, once guided and helped the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory in the trial production of Chloramphenicol. Polish experts and Major General Sokhey of India, among others, all gave us many valuable inspiring suggestions and concrete assistance.

　　This time it is our domestic academic conference, but international friends have also given us the best gifts – delivering many valuable reports for us one after another. Dr. W. Kurylowicz, Director of the Antibiotics Research Laboratory of the National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw, Poland, gave a report entitled "The Development of Modern Antibiotics Research." Professor Yusuke Sumiki, an agricultural chemist from Japan, gave two research reports on new anti-tuberculosis antibiotics. Dr. E.M. Popov, a Bulgarian mycologist, gave a report on "Practical Problems of Antibiotics." Candidate Dr. Yarinpiir, a Mongolian microbiologist, gave a report entitled "The Application of Antibiotics in Medical Institutions of the Mongolian People's Republic." Corresponding Academician N.A. Krasilnikov and Professor V.P. Savich from the Soviet Union gave reports on "The Principles of Classification of Actinomycetes that Produce Antibiotics" and "Lichens – Sources of Antibiotics," respectively. They shared the high achievements of their work and academics with Chinese scientific workers.

　　When Chinese scientific workers discussed their own academic papers and research reports, international friends also enthusiastically participated and sincerely offered opinions and questions. As soon as they discovered any advantages in our reports, they immediately gave encouragement. On the morning of December 2nd, when discussing the three reports "Distribution of Antagonistic Actinomycetes in Soil," "Report on the Isolation of Actinomycetes in the Soil of the Suburbs of Beijing," and "Investigation of Antibiotic Actinomycetes in the Soil of Gutian and Fuzhou," Corresponding Academician N.A. Krasilnikov from the Soviet Union interestingly cited the story of a Soviet scholar's failure in studying this aspect to illustrate the value of the above reports. He earnestly hoped that we would achieve more in this area in the future. When discussing the issue of finding new antibiotics, Professor Yusuke Sumiki from Japan told his Chinese friends with emotion, "Japanese scientists are also working hard to find new antibiotics, but good antibiotics have not been found. Why is it not easy to find them? Because they are still using the Anglo-American methods. Recently, several have been found. Why were they found? Because Japan used its own methods." When discussing the "Preliminary Report on the Separation of Dihydrostreptose," Professor Yusuke Sumiki introduced the method of separating "Dihydrostreptose" with "Hydroxystreptomycin," and said: "'Hydroxystreptomycin' was first obtained by a friend of mine, and I can try to send you some." In the discussion, Chinese and foreign scientific workers often asked and answered questions to each other.

　　The reports and opinions of international friends will be of great inspiration and help to our antibiotics research work. The conference concluded successfully, and Chinese and foreign scientists smiled and wished each other greater achievements in academics in the future for the happiness of mankind, and greater contributions to international academic exchange.

    为了人类幸福
    ——一九五五年抗生素学术会议侧记
  　鉴远
    在一九五五年抗生素学术会议的席位上，坐着苏联的微生物学家、波兰华沙大学微生物学的教授、罗马尼亚的病毒学家、保加利亚人民保健部拉兹格拉德城青霉素厂的科学部主任、蒙古乔巴山大学的教员、越南的细菌学博士。这里，还坐着日本东京大学的教授、缅甸仰光大学的病理学教授、印度尼西亚大学医学院药剂系主任、朝鲜的科学工作者以及丹麦的科学工作者。来宾们在这次会议开幕的时候，就在祝辞中对中国朋友说，抗生素的科学研究工作、一切科学研究工作，都是为了人类幸福，都需要国际间的共同合作。
    我国科学工作人员，面对着来自这许多国家的客人，不由回想起今年二月间在波兰华沙举行的“国际抗生素问题会议”。我国派代表团参加了那次会议，并宣读了三篇论文：“青霉素生产——用白玉米面代替乳糖中间厂试制”、“青霉素生产——用棉籽饼代替玉蜀黍浆在一千五百加仑发酵罐之培养”、“金霉素中间厂试制”。各国代表们对我们的工作很感兴趣，特别注意我国青霉素发酵单位。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克愿意试用棉籽饼。我国代表团也有很大收获，带回了宝贵的菌种，学习到许多关于制造抗生素的新方法和先进经验。
    我国科学工作人员特别难忘的是在我国抗生素事业发展过程中，国际友人给了我们许多具体的帮助。苏联专家格·玛·瓦西列夫对上海第三制药厂的青霉素生产方法建议缩短发酵时间，采用逆流提炼方法，因而增产约百分之三十三。他又推动了这个厂对操作规程的编订，使生产管理逐渐向着正规化发展。青霉菌的发育形态和生产力的关系的研究和应用，也是瓦西列夫建议的，使青霉素的生产方法更趋向于科学化。另一位苏联专家弗·阿·札撒索夫，他曾经指导并帮助东北制药厂进行合霉素的试制工作。波兰的专家们和印度的索克少将等，都给了我们很多宝贵的启发性的意见和具体帮助。
    这次我们是国内的学术会议，但国际友人们也给了我们最好的礼物——先后为我们作了许多珍贵的报告。波兰国立华沙卫生研究所抗生素研究室主任符·库里洛维奇博士作了以“近代抗生素研究事业的发展”为题的报告。日本农业化学家住木谕介教授作了两篇关于抗结核菌的新抗生素的研究报告。保加利亚霉菌学家埃·姆·波波夫博士作了“抗生素的实践问题”的报告。蒙古微生物学家雅林皮尔候补博士以“在蒙古人民共和国医疗机构内抗生素的应用问题”为题作了报告。还有苏联纳·阿·克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士和弗·普·萨维奇教授，分别作了“产生抗生素的放线菌的分类原则”和“地衣——抗生素的来源”的报告。他们把自己工作中和学术上的高度成就告诉了我国科学工作人员。
    当我国科学工作人员讨论自己的学术论文和研究报告的时候，国际友人们也热情地参加，并真诚地提出意见和问题。一发觉我们的报告有什么优点，他们立即给以鼓励。十二月二日上午讨论“土壤中颉顽性放线菌的分布”、“北京郊区土壤中放线菌分离工作报告”和“福州古田两地区土壤中抗生性放线菌的调查”三个报告的时候，苏联纳·阿·克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士有趣地举出了苏联一个学者研究这方面问题失败的故事，来说明上述报告的价值。他并恳切希望今后我们在这方面的工作取得更多的成就。当讨论寻找新抗生素问题的时候，日本住木谕介教授感慨地告诉中国朋友：“目前日本科学家也在努力寻找新抗生素，但是好的抗生素没有找到。为什么不容易找到呢？因为还是搬用英美那一套方法。最近找到了几种。为什么找到了呢？因为日本用了自己的方法。”当讨论“双氢链糖分离的初步报告”的时候，住木谕介教授介绍了用“羟基链霉素”分离“双氢链糖”的方法，并说：“‘羟基链霉素’是我的一个朋友首先得到的，我可以设法送给你们一些。”在讨论中，中外科学工作者还常常互相提问，互相解答。
    国际友人的报告和意见对我们的抗生素研究工作将有很大的启发和帮助。会议圆满地闭幕了，中外科学家们含笑互祝：为了人类幸福，今后在学术上获得更大的成就，为国际间的学术交流作出更大的贡献。
