Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. The 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference concluded on the 6th. After enthusiastic academic discussions, the scientists participating in the conference summarized past work and proposed future research directions and tasks.

The conference resolution passed today pointed out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the needs of the people's health, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the diligent efforts of scientific workers and production department employees, and the enthusiastic assistance of other countries, the research and production of antibiotics has achieved great development. Over the past few years, preliminary solutions have been found for the production methods of penicillin, chloramphenicol, aureomycin, and streptomycin. Penicillin and chloramphenicol have been put into production, and streptomycin and aureomycin have also begun entering the intermediate factory trial production stage. Theoretical and applied research has been carried out on the biology and chemistry of antibiotic-producing bacteria, and some achievements have been made. Preliminary work has also begun on the clinical application of new antibiotics and known antibiotics. The above work has made certain contributions to the country. However, these achievements, whether in quantity or quality, are far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. The reports from this conference reflect that there are still some weak links in various aspects of antibiotic research work, which urgently need to be strengthened in the future.

The conference pointed out that in the future, in addition to continuing to assist in solving scientific and technological problems in production and trial production, especially solving the problem of streptomyces bacteriophage, the focus of scientific research work should be placed on vigorously developing research on new antibiotics and basic theoretical research on various disciplines of antibiotics, as well as research on the medical and agricultural applications of antibiotics.

At the afternoon meeting today, Soviet microbiologist and corresponding academician of the Academy of Sciences, Krasilnikov, gave an academic report entitled "Classification Principles of Actinomycetes Producing Antibiotics."

Scientists from the Soviet Union, Poland, Japan, Bulgaria, Indonesia, Romania, Vietnam, Mongolia, Burma, and North Korea spoke at the conference. They expressed their gratitude to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for inviting them to participate in this conference, which gave them the opportunity to discuss antibiotics research work and exchange academic experiences with scientists from China and other countries in a friendly and warm atmosphere. They hoped to strengthen cooperation and experience exchange among scientists from various countries in the field of antibiotics work in the future.

During the recess, the scientists participating in the conference successively attended a discussion meeting on the clinical application of antibiotics hosted by the Ministry of Health, a symposium on the teaching plan for antibiotics manufacturing industry majors held by the Ministry of Higher Education, and listened to an academic report by Polish antibiotic expert Dr. Kurilovich at a report meeting jointly organized by the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Society for Microbiology, entitled "Comparative Studies of BCG Strains from Different Sources."

Chinese and foreign scientists participating in the conference also viewed the Chinese-made antibiotic samples displayed at the venue, new antibiotic bacterial specimens isolated from Chinese soil, and other specimens and photos related to antibiotic research, as well as gifts presented by representatives from various countries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 6th to entertain Soviet corresponding academician of the Academy of Sciences Krasilnikov, Professor Savich, Romanian academician Nicolaou, Polish Dr. Kurilovich, Japanese Dr. Yosuke Sumiki, Burmese Dr. U Khin Maung U, Bulgarian Dr. Popov, Indonesian Dr. Darman, Vietnamese Dr. Nguyen Van Huong, Mongolian alternate Dr. Yalinpil, and North Korean researcher Liu Ronggui, who were invited to attend the 1955 Antibiotics Academic Conference. Soviet advisors to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Rafikov and Serjuchenko, were also invited to attend the banquet.

The banquet was hosted by Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, vice presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. More than fifty scientists including Zhao Chenggu, Dai Fanglan, Wang You, Yin Hongzhang, and Tang Feifan attended as guests.

Di Jingxiang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry, Cui Yitian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, and Gong Naiquan, Vice Minister of the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also attended as guests.

Wu Youxun delivered a speech at the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he extended a warm welcome and high respect to the foreign guests present. He also proposed a toast to the prosperity of the scientific cause serving peace and to the health of the foreign guests. Chinese and foreign scientists had a cordial conversation during the banquet.

    一九五五年抗生素学术会议闭幕
    提出抗生素研究工作方向和任务
    科学院欢宴参加抗生素学术会议的外国科学家
    新华社六日讯　一九五五年抗生素学术会议六日闭幕。参加会议的科学家经过热烈的学术讨论，总结了过去的工作，提出了今后的研究方向和任务。
    今日通过的会议决议中指出：中华人民共和国成立以来，由于人民保健事业的需要，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导、科学工作者和生产部门职工的辛勤努力以及其他国家的热情帮助下，抗生素的研究和生产事业已获得了很大的发展。几年来，初步解决了青霉素、氯霉素、金霉素和链霉素的生产方法，青霉素和氯霉素已投入生产，链霉素和金霉素也已开始进入中间工厂试制阶段；在抗生菌的生物学和化学方面都进行了理论性和应用性的研究，并获得了一些成就；对新抗生素和已知抗生素在临床应用方面也开始了初步的工作，上述这些工作为国家作出了一定的贡献。但是，这些成就无论在量或质方面都还远不能满足国家和人民的需要，从这次会议的报告中反映出抗生素研究工作在各方面都还存在着一些薄弱环节，亟待今后加强。
    会议指出：今后除了继续协助解决生产和试制中的科学技术问题，特别是解决链霉菌噬菌体这一问题以外，科学研究工作的重点应放在大力开展新抗生素的研究和抗生素的各学科的基本理论的研究，以及抗生素在医学和农业应用上的研究。
    在今日下午的会议上，苏联微生物学家克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士作了题为“产生抗生素的放线菌的分类原则”的学术报告。
    苏联、波兰、日本、保加利亚、印度尼西亚、罗马尼亚、越南、蒙古、缅甸、朝鲜的科学家代表都在会上讲了话，他们对于中国科学院邀请他们参加这次会议，使他们有机会在友好热烈的空气中同中国以及其他国家科学家共同讨论抗生素研究工作并且交流了学术经验，表示感谢；他们希望今后加强各国科学家在抗生素工作方面的合作和经验交流。
    参加会议的科学家在休会期间曾先后出席了卫生部主持的关于抗生素临床应用的讨论会，高等教育部举办的关于抗生素制造工业专业教学计划的座谈会，并且在中华医学会和中国微生物学会联合举办的报告会上听了波兰抗生素学家库里洛维奇博士的题为“不同来源的卡介苗菌株的比较研究”的学术报告。
    参加会议的中外科学家还观看了陈列在会场上的中国制造的抗生素样品、从中国土壤中分离出来的新抗生菌标本和其他有关抗生素研究的标本和照片，以及各国代表赠送的礼物。
    新华社六日讯　中国科学院六日晚在北京饭店举行宴会，招待应邀出席一九五五年抗生素学术会议的苏联克拉西尔尼科夫通讯院士、萨维奇教授、罗马尼亚尼古劳院士、波兰库里洛维奇博士、日本住木谕介博士、缅甸吴钦茂温博士、保加利亚波波夫博士、印度尼西亚达尔曼博士、越南阮文享博士、蒙古雅林皮尔候补博士和朝鲜刘荣圭研究员。应邀出席宴会的还有中国科学院的苏联顾问拉菲柯夫和谢尔裘琴科。
    宴会由中国科学院副院长陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训主持。出席作陪的有科学家赵承嘏、戴芳澜、汪猷、殷宏章、汤飞凡等五十多人。
    出席作陪的还有轻工业部副部长狄景襄、卫生部副部长崔义田、高等教育部副部长曾昭抡、中国人民解放军总后勤部卫生部副部长宫乃泉。
    吴有训在宴会上致词。他代表中国科学院向到会的外宾表示热烈欢迎和崇高的敬意。并且提议为服务于和平的科学事业的繁荣以及外宾们的健康干杯。中外科学家在席间亲切地进行了交谈。
