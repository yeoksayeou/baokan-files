    Some in-service Western medicine practitioners in Beijing have begun systematically studying traditional Chinese medicine. The first group of over one hundred medical workers, organized by the Ministry of Health, the General Logistics Department Health Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, among other units, began classes in early December. More than forty famous traditional Chinese medicine doctors from provinces and cities across the country are responsible for the teaching work.
    The first group of students is working in thirteen units, including Beijing Hospital, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and its affiliated hospitals, the First and Second Affiliated Hospitals of Beijing Medical College, Central People's Hospital, Beijing Children's Hospital, and Beijing Tongren Hospital. Most of them graduated from advanced medical colleges and have some work experience. Among them are medical school professors, hospital vice presidents, and attending physicians.
    The study period for the first group of students is scheduled for three years. The students will study the Chinese Communist Party's policies towards traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine works such as "Huangdi Neijing" (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine), "Shanghan Lun" (Treatise on Cold Damage), "Jinkui Yaolue" (Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber), and "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" (Shen Nong's Materia Medica), as well as the clinical experience of various traditional Chinese medicine departments.
