Xinhua News Agency, December 11th. Premier Grotewohl, head of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, and some members of the delegation, visited the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory this morning. This is a new type of textile factory with 50,000 spindles and over 1,000 looms.

Yang Huijie, the female director of the textile factory, told the distinguished guests cordially that not only did the entire set of spinning machines in the factory come from the German Democratic Republic, but also four textile machinery experts from Karl-Marx-Stadt in the German Democratic Republic participated in the machine installation work. They were conscientious and responsible for the installation of every part. Yang Huijie said, "Our Chinese workers will never forget the help given to us by the working brothers of the German Democratic Republic."

Premier Grotewohl said that he was very pleased to have the opportunity to see the machines made by German workers helping China in its production. He said that this shows how important it is to further strengthen the friendship between China and Germany. Premier Grotewohl expressed his hope that the Chinese working class will achieve brilliant achievements in building socialism and creating a better and happier life.

The distinguished guests, accompanied by the hosts, visited all production processes of the textile factory.

On the walls and blackboards of each workshop, slogans welcoming the delegation and cheering for Sino-German friendship were written everywhere. On a blackboard in one of the production workshops was written: "Long live the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Germany!" Above the slogan were two huge hands clasped tightly together, and above that was a dove symbolizing peace.

The female director told the distinguished guests that this was created by the workers themselves.

Premier Grotewohl smiled and admired it there for a long time, and then he picked up a piece of chalk and wrote on the blackboard in German: "Thank you! Forward to Socialism."

In the spinning workshop, Premier Grotewohl carefully observed the workers' production situation; and talked to many workers separately, asking if the machines from the German Democratic Republic were good. The workers all replied that they were very good, and they asked Premier Grotewohl to thank the working brothers of the German Democratic Republic on their behalf.

Accompanying the distinguished guests on the visit were Ke Hua, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Liu Jingyu, Deputy Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Department.

    格罗提渥总理等参观北京第一棉纺织厂
    新华社十一日讯　德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长格罗提渥总理和一部分团员，今天上午参观了国营北京第一棉纺织厂。这是一座拥有五万纱锭和一千多台织布机的新型的纺织厂。
    这个纺织厂女厂长杨慧洁亲切地告诉贵宾们：在这个工厂里，不仅全程纺纱机都来自民主德国，而且曾经有来自民主德国卡尔·马克思城的四位纺织机械专家参加了机器安装工作。他们对每个零件的安装都是认真负责的。杨慧洁说：“我们中国工人永远忘不了民主德国的工人兄弟给予我们的帮助。”
    格罗提渥总理说，他非常高兴地能够有机会看到德国工人制造出来的机器帮助中国生产的情况。他说，这说明进一步加强中德两国之间的友谊是多么重要的事情。格罗提渥总理希望中国工人阶级在建设社会主义和创造美好幸福的生活中取得光辉成就。
    贵宾们由主人陪同，参观了纺织厂的各个生产工序。
    在各车间的墙壁上和黑板上，到处都写着欢迎代表团和欢呼中德友谊的标语。有一个生产车间的黑板上写着：“中德两国人民兄弟友谊万岁！”标语上面画着紧紧拉在一起的两只巨大的手，再上面是一只象征着和平的鸽子。
    女厂长告诉贵宾们，这是工人们自己创作的。
    格罗提渥总理含笑地在那里欣赏了很久，随后他拿起粉笔在黑板上用德文写道：“谢谢！向社会主义前进。”
    在纺纱车间，格罗提渥总理仔细地参观了工人的生产情况；并分别地和许多工人进行谈话，问民主德国的机器好不好，工人都回答很好，他们请格罗提渥总理代为向民主德国的工人兄弟致谢。
    陪同贵宾们参观的，有外交部礼宾司司长柯华和苏联东欧司副司长刘靖宇。
