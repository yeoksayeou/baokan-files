    The Countryside in the High Tide of Cooperativization
    A Thunderclap Heard Throughout the Land
    Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperativization spread like lightning to every village in Huaibin County, Henan Province. People happily said: The road to happiness is illuminated even brighter!
    In just a few days, 50,000 poor and lower-middle peasant households joined or actively requested to join agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 80 percent of the county's total number of poor and lower-middle peasant households. Out of the county's total of 180 townships, 114 already had farmers joining or actively requesting to join cooperatives, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total farm households.
    The county has trained more than 8,000 core members for establishing cooperatives in the past month. One hundred and twenty-eight mutual aid team leaders, without receiving any notification, automatically carried their rice and bedding to the training class to participate in the study. When asked, "You weren't notified, how did you come?" Some replied: "Chairman Mao called us! Chairman Mao pointed out the way for us, why wouldn't we come?" Some replied: "A thunderclap is heard throughout the land, who can't hear Chairman Mao's call!" (Yu Chuangye)
    Land Connected, Hearts United
    "Everyone should look to the future, eliminate small private ideas;
    Dig up boundary stones, level field edges, unlock the iron chains of a thousand years;
    Land connected into large pieces, machines can then turn in circles;
    All members think for the collective, socialist realization will come early."
    Many farmers in the tenth township of Baqiao District, Xi'an City, in order to express their determination to join the cooperative, automatically dug up boundary stones and leveled field edges when plowing the land this autumn, and composed such a "ditty," singing it everywhere.
    The newly expanded "Red Flag" agricultural production cooperative in Wanzier Village of this township, with 102 member households, has already dug up more than 180 boundary stones and leveled more than 120 field edges, increasing cultivated land by about 11.5 mu, making the cooperative's more than 1,070 mu of cultivated land connected into six large pieces.
    For the sake of running the cooperative together, the private estrangements and personal rivalries of the farmers have gradually disappeared.
    Zhang Jiudian and his uncle Zhang Dengliang, farmers in this village, often quarreled over trivial matters due to a family division, and any accidental entry into the other's allotted courtyard would cause a storm. After joining the cooperative, they often studied production together harmoniously.
    A farmer in this village wrote a couplet on his door:
    The first line is: "Members are like brothers";
    The second line is: "The agricultural cooperative is our home";
    The horizontal inscription is: "Striving for Socialism." (Yang Xijian)
    The Golden Yellow Small City
    As the sickle sounded and the crops fell, around the two threshing grounds outside Fangjia Village in Tieshan District, Lushun, forty-three tall and large corn barns stood side by side, like two golden yellow small cities.
    These are the threshing grounds of the two agricultural production cooperatives in this village. Soon after the distribution lists of the two cooperatives were posted in the village, the area below the lists was crowded with people. All the farmers outside the cooperatives shouted about the "miracle" of the agricultural production cooperatives achieving a good harvest even with disaster on poor land.
    In the evening, the branch held a mass meeting to mobilize people to join the cooperative, and early the next morning, the agricultural production cooperative's office was crowded with people requesting to join. Liu Fuzhi, the female leader of the mutual aid team, came with seven team members. She said in a brisk tone: "After watching for another year, we finally chose the cooperative!" She also said, "Looking near, the cooperative, the land changes, yields more grain, corn barns are lined up like walls; looking far, tractors, large farms, the scenery is the same as in the Soviet Union."
    A few days ago, the "Advanced" Agricultural Production Cooperative No. 1晒满了the threshing ground with corn in order to hand in public grain. One evening, the cooperative suddenly notified its members: A heavy storm is coming, hurry to the threshing ground! Soon, fifty or sixty people came to the threshing ground. In the dark, it was difficult to see who they all were. On closer inspection, many were people who wanted to join the cooperative but had not yet joined. They said: The cooperative's grain is the same as our grain, we can't let it suffer any loss! Everyone worked hard in the dark, and 15,000 jin of corn was loaded into the barn in no time, without getting wet at all. (Wang Shi)
    Mountains to be Greened, People to be Cultured
    In the mountains of Chengde, Hebei, there is a village called Yuzhangzi, where 172 farm households live in 14 natural villages. In the past, many people said that socialism could not be built in this poor mountain valley; however, by this autumn, 91 percent of the village's farm households were already members of agricultural production cooperatives. In the past, the lives of the farmers here could not even be described as "half grain of bran and vegetables." Dong Shifang's family of five used to go up the mountains every day in the summer to pick wild vegetables to eat, and in the winter, the two adults only had one torn and tattered cotton trousers, and the children couldn't even wear a thread of cloth, so the whole family had to huddle together around a fire all day long. Now, they have built three new houses, both inside and outside are white and bright, adults and children wear new summer clothes in the summer, new cotton clothes in the winter, and new lined clothes in the spring and autumn, and a pile of new floral quilts on the kang.
    In the past, pieces of scattered mountain land were eroded by water, leaving only sand and gravel. After the establishment of the cooperative, more than 500 dams have been built, more than 100 mountain gullies have been blocked, 7,000 poplar and willow trees, 70,000 black pine trees, more than 10,000 various fruit trees, 4,000 mulberry trees, and 5,000 prickly ash trees have been planted. In addition to improving technology, the village has already achieved an average grain yield of more than 540 jin per mu, and last year's sideline income was nearly 40,000 yuan. By 1957, the entire village, both on the mountains and below, will be completely green, and there will be even more cattle, sheep, and grain.
    In the past, some farmers here had to go four or five li away to ask someone to write and read letters. Now, there are already two primary schools, and more than 120 young men and women are studying in spare-time schools, where they often read books and newspapers and have learned a lot of production knowledge. Many people say: Chairman Mao has cured the blindness of many years! (Jiang Baoxi)

    在合作化高潮中的农村
    雷响一声天下知
    毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告像闪电一样传到了河南省淮滨县的每一个村庄。人们欢欢喜喜地说：幸福的路照得更亮了！
    没有多少天，就有五万户贫农和下中农加入了或者积极要求加入农业生产合作社，占全县贫农和下中农的总户数的百分之八十以上。全县总共一百八十个乡，入社和积极要求入社的农民占总农户百分之八十以上的已经有一百一十四个。
    全县一个月来已经训练了八千多个建社骨干分子。有一百二十八个互助组长，并没有接到通知，就自动背着米扛着铺盖到训练班参加学习。问他们：“没通知你们，怎么就来了？”他们有的回答：“是毛主席叫我们来的！毛主席给我们指了路，为什么不来？”有的回答：“雷响一声天下知，毛主席的号召谁还能听不见！”。　（余创业）
    地连片，人连心
    “人人要往远处看，取消私人小观念；
    挖界石，平地畔，打开千年铁锁链；
    土地连成大片片，机器才能转圈圈；
    社员都为社着想，社会主义早实现。”
    西安市灞桥区第十个乡的许多农民，为了表示坚决入社，在今年秋天耕地的时候自动把界石挖掉了，地畔掀平了，并且编了这样的“顺口溜”，到处歌唱。
    这个乡的湾子二村新近扩大的“红旗”农业生产合作社，一百零二户社员，已经挖了一百八十多块界石，平了一百二十多条地畔，大约增加耕地十一亩五分，使全社的一千零七十多亩耕地连成了六大片。
    为了共同办社，农民们的私人隔阂，个人意气渐渐消失了。
    这个村的农民张九典和他的叔父张登良，因为分家的事，五六年来常为小事打闹，谁偶然进入另一个人的分得的房院，就会引起一场风波。他们入社以后，经常和和气气地在一块研究生产了。
    这个村有一家农民在门前写一付对联：
    上联是：“社员们如同亲兄弟”；
    下联是：“农业社就是咱的家”；
    横额是：“奔社会主义”。　（杨希坚）
    金黄色的小城
    随着镰刀响，庄稼倒，在旅顺铁山区方家村村外两个场院周围，并排竖起了四十三个又高又大的玉米仓，像两座金黄色的小城。
    这是这个村子里的两个农业生产合作社的场院。两个社的分配榜在村子里张贴出来以后不久，榜下面就聚满了人。全村社外农民都嚷嚷农业生产合作社薄地遇灾还丰收了的“奇迹”。
    晚上支部召开了动员入社的群众大会，第二天一大早，农业生产合作社的办公室就挤满了要求入社的人。互助组女组长刘福芝带着七个组员一齐来了。她用轻快的语调说：“又看了一年，我们到底看中合作社了！”她还说“近处看，合作社，地变样，多打粮，玉米仓子摆成墙；远处看，拖拉机，大农庄，光景跟苏联一个样。”
      “先进”农业生产合作社第一社为了交公粮，前些日子把玉米晒满了场院。一天傍晚，社里忽然通知社员：大风雨就要来了，赶紧到场院去！很快场院上就来了五六十个人。在黑夜里，一下子看不清都是谁。仔细一瞧，很多是要求入社可是还没有入社的人。他们说：社里的粮和我们的粮一样，不能让它受一点损失！大家摸着黑，七手八脚地干起来，一万五千斤玉米，一会儿就装进仓里去了，一点也没淋湿。　（王矢）
    山要绿化，人要文化
    热河承德的群山里边，有一个于杖子村，一百七十二户农户就分住了十四个自然屯。过去很多人说在这穷山窝里不能建设社会主义；可是，到今年秋天，全村百分之九十一的农户已经是农业生产合作社的社员了。过去这里农民的生活连“糠菜半年粮”也说不上。董士芳一家五口，过去夏天每天上山采野菜吃，冬天两口大人只有一件破开花的棉裤，几个孩子连一条布丝也穿不上，全家只好围成一团成天拢火。现在，盖了三间新房，屋里屋外又白又亮，大人小孩夏天都穿新单衣，冬天都穿新棉衣，春天秋天还有新夹衣，新花被子在炕上一大堆。
    过去，一块块零碎的山地，被水冲得只剩下了砂石。成立合作社以后，已经修了五百多道坝，闸了一百多道山沟，栽杨柳七千棵，黑松七万棵，各种果树一万多棵，桑树四千棵，花椒树五千棵。加上改进技术，全村已经做到了每亩平均产粮五百四十多斤，去年一年副业收入近四万元。到一九五七年，全村山上山下就要完全绿化起来，牛羊和粮食也要更多了。
    过去，这里有些农民要写信、看信都得到四五里外去求人。现在，已经有了两个小学，还有一百二十多名男女青年在业余学校学习，他们经常看书看报，学到了很多生产知识。许多人说：多少年的睁眼瞎，今天让毛主席给治好了！　（蒋宝玺）
