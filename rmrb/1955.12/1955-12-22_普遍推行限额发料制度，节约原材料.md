    Universally Promote the Quota Material Issuance System, Save Raw Materials
    Zhang Dadian
    The materials allocated to workshops by enterprises, whether main materials, auxiliary materials, fuels, tools, or spare parts, must be planned. The basis of these plans is the material consumption quota and the workshop's production plan. Quota material issuance means strictly calculating the workshop's monthly material requirements according to the workshop's monthly production operation plan and advanced material consumption quotas, with the warehouse preparing materials and distributing them to each workshop according to this quota.
    Implementing the quota material issuance system in a planned and step-by-step manner is one of the most important organizational tasks in the material supply work of factories and mines. Implementing the quota material issuance system can improve the planning and predictability of material supply to workshops, make material supply work closely cooperate with production, and facilitate the supervision of material consumption in production. Strictly controlling the numbers of material allocation can eliminate "black materials" and "black warehouses" in workshops, avoid workers using "black materials" for production and concealing defective products. Implementing the quota material issuance system can also strengthen the accounting of material expenditures in production, provide a reliable basis for the enterprise's economic activity analysis, and enable us to formulate measures based on it to continuously improve material supply work and organize the vast number of employees to fight against the waste of raw materials.
    In the past, some enterprises did not seriously implement the quota material issuance system, and the waste of materials was very serious. For example, in Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard, many metal materials were stored in the open air without management, and workshops could use them at will. As a result, dozens of tons of scrap steel plates disappeared, fifty tons of copper parts were also lost, and the theft of metal materials continued to occur. In this factory, material issuance without verification, leftover materials not returned to the warehouse, and replenishment of materials for defective products have become common practice. The material management work of Shanghai Boiler Factory was also very chaotic. Material supply personnel were clueless about the workshop's material usage, blindly preparing materials, resulting in large amounts of backlog. The over-reserved funds in the first quarter alone reached 4.6 million yuan. Boiler steel plates were everywhere, and workers could "choose" them at will, with finished products coming out without material requisition. Under such circumstances, it is difficult for enterprises to calculate the true cost of products, let alone save.
    Since the central government put forward the call for comprehensive conservation this year, many enterprises have attached importance to the work of saving raw materials and have organized a series of activities for saving raw materials by the broad masses of employees. The advanced experience of quota material issuance has begun to be promoted in some enterprises, and some have achieved good results. For example, after the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory implemented the quota material issuance system, the waste materials utilized in September alone reached 32,700 kilograms, equivalent to 310% of the average utilization rate from January to August; 14,110 kilograms of steel were used less, saving 11,872 yuan. In the past, substandard products were discarded, resulting in a large amount of backlog of funds; after strictly controlling material issuance, 30,000 long-term backlog of steel plowshares and 2,650 wheel rims were repaired and used in a timely manner. After Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory promoted this advanced experience, 96 workers no longer needed to go to the warehouse to complete material requisition procedures every day. They saved 5,841.3 auxiliary man-hours in the production process of 120 drilling machines.
    However, there are still many enterprises that have not implemented this method. The leading staff of some enterprises mistakenly believe that quota material issuance is a constraint and restriction on production, and that implementing this system will hinder the completion of production tasks. In order to complete production tasks, they do not hesitate to invest too much material into production, believing that as long as the production tasks are completed, some material waste is inevitable. There are also some leading staff of enterprises who do not support the supply personnel in implementing the quota material issuance work. They believe that implementing quota material issuance cannot solve the current production problems, and production will continue in the same way without implementing quota material issuance. These ideas and practices are of course wrong. We know that if the supply of raw materials is not timely and complete, the enterprise's production plan will be difficult to complete. Even if the output plan is completed, there will be a great waste in the use of materials, and the cost cannot be reduced.
    Is the condition for implementing the quota material issuance system in factories and mines now available? It should be said that the conditions are available. In recent years, with the recovery and development of the national economy, various enterprises have accumulated certain management experience. The state has formulated a five-year plan, and the industrial production tasks have been stabilized. Through the general survey of material consumption quotas, the material consumption quotas of products are also close to actual values. These are all very favorable conditions for implementing the quota material issuance system. Of course, there are still some enterprises whose production tasks have not been fully determined, and it is difficult to implement the quota material issuance system in these enterprises. However, these difficulties can be overcome with the continuous improvement of production operation plans and production technology management. The most important thing here is to start with the main materials or main workshops first, based on the actual conditions of the enterprise, combined with the requirements of production development, and then gradually promote it.
    According to the experience of some factories and mines, the following tasks should be done well to implement the quota material issuance system:
    First, the enterprise's production plan must be determined in a timely manner. If the plan is set too late, it will cause difficulties in the supply of raw materials; if the plan changes too much, it will cause a backlog of some raw materials and insufficient supply of some raw materials. Therefore, to implement the quota material issuance system, it is necessary to establish a normal planning work order first. The planning department should provide the annual, quarterly, and monthly production outlines and monthly production operation plans on time, and the technology department should provide the consumption quotas of raw materials on time. Then, the supply department, according to these indicators, should carefully check the sufficiency of the inventory materials, accurately plan the workshop's material requirements and the quota that should be allocated, so that the specified quota fully meets the workshop's production needs.
    Advanced material consumption quota is the scientific basis for calculating material requirements. Due to the strengthening of material management and the improvement of production technology, the material consumption quota will inevitably continue to decrease. Therefore, the process of implementing the quota material issuance is also the process of continuously reducing the material consumption quota. The supply staff of each enterprise should carefully supervise the consumption of materials in production, constantly revise the backward quotas, raise them to an advanced level, thereby gradually reducing the material allocation quota and saving materials to the maximum extent.
    Second, certain equipment should be equipped in the warehouse organization to centrally process materials such as cutting, sawing, sorting, and crushing according to workshop needs. Experience has proved that centralized blanking can save metal consumption. For example, Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory implemented the nesting method of silicon steel sheets, saving 10% to 14.7% of silicon steel sheets for motors and 12% of silicon steel sheets for transformers. The steel plates used for external cylindrical grinders in Shanghai Machine Tool Factory were centrally sheared according to the drawn patterns, increasing the utilization rate by 8%. Carefully compiling the blanking plan can also effectively utilize long materials, short materials, head materials, and edge materials, and give full play to the material potential of the enterprise.
    Quota material issuance must be combined with the material delivery system, and the raw materials that should be issued must be directly delivered to the workshop or work site. Because workshop workers go to the warehouse to collect materials, it will waste effective production time. Implementing the material delivery system can greatly reduce the auxiliary working time of workshop workers and improve labor productivity. In order to strictly save material consumption, it is also necessary to implement the system of returning leftover materials to the warehouse and recycle waste materials according to quotas. Strictly implementing this system can avoid workshops using materials from each other, eliminate "black materials" in workshops, and reduce the generation of defective products and waste materials.
    With a meticulous system, it is also necessary to regularly and carefully check the implementation, to prevent the system from becoming a mere formality.
    Promoting quota material issuance is an important method to save raw materials and reduce product costs. It uses scientific organizational work to supply thousands of materials to workshops in the most economical quantity. It is also a method to promote the improvement of business management of the entire enterprise. The leading staff of enterprises should support this work, and under the leadership of the Party, trade union and youth league organizations should also closely cooperate to widely carry out this work in factories and mines in various places, so as to accumulate more funds for the country and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the country's first five-year plan.

    普遍推行限额发料制度，节约原材料
    张大巅
    企业拨发给车间的材料，无论是主要材料、辅助材料、燃料、工具或备件，都必须是有计划的。这些计划的基础就是材料消耗定额和车间的生产计划。限额发料，就是严格按照车间的月度生产作业计划和先进的材料消耗定额，计算车间的月份材料需用量，仓库按照这个限额准备材料，分发给各个车间。
    有计划、有步骤地推行限额发料制度，是厂矿企业材料供应工作中的一项最重要的组织任务。推行限额发料制度，可以提高给车间供应材料的计划性和预见性，可以使材料供应工作紧密地配合生产，便于监督生产中的材料消耗。严格控制材料拨发的数字，可以消灭车间的“黑料”和“黑仓库”，避免工人用“黑料”进行生产和隐蔽废品。推行限额发料制度，还可以加强生产中材料支出的核算，给企业的经济活动分析提供可靠的依据，使我们有可能据以制定措施，不断地改善材料供应工作，并且把广大职工组织起来，为消灭原材料的浪费现象而斗争。
    过去有些企业没有认真地推行限额发料制度，材料的浪费现象很严重。例如，上海中华造船厂的很多金属材料都是在露天存放，无人管理，车间可以随便挪用。结果，几十吨废钢板不见了，五十吨铜件也丢失了，金属材料被盗窃的现象不断发生。在这个厂里，发料不审核，余料不退库，产生了废品就补料等等，已经成为惯例。上海锅炉厂的材料管理工作也很混乱，材料供应人员对车间用料心中无数，盲目备料，大量积压，仅第一季超储备资金便达四百六十万元。锅炉钢板到处都是，工人可以任意“选用”，不领料就出了成品。在这种情况下，企业很难计算出真实的产品成本，当然更谈不到什么节约。
    今年中央提出全面节约的号召以后，不少企业都重视了节约原材料的工作，组织广大职工进行了
  一系列的节约原材料的活动。限额发料这一先进经验，在一些企业中开始推广了，有的还取得了很好的成绩。例如，北京农业机械厂实行限额发料以后，仅仅九月份一个月利用的废料就达三万二千七百公斤，相当一至八月份平均利用率的百分之三百
  一十；钢材少用了一万四千一百一十公斤，节约资金一万一千八百七十二元。过去出了不合格品就丢在一边，因此积压的资金很多；严格控制发料后，长期积压下来的钢犁铧三万片、轮圈二千六百五十件，都及时修复使用了。太原矿山机器厂推行了这种先进经验后，每天就有九十六个工人不用再到仓库里办理领料手续了。他们在一百二十部钻探机的生产过程中，就节约了五千八百四十一点三个辅助工时。
    但是，现在也还有不少的企业没有推行这种方法。一些企业的领导工作人员错误地认为：限额发料是对于生产的约束和限制，推行这一制度就会妨碍生产任务的完成。他们为了完成生产任务，不惜把过多的材料投入生产，认为只要完成生产任务，浪费一些材料是不可避免的。还有一些企业的领导工作人员，不支持供应人员推行限额发料工作，他们认为实行限额发料解决不了当前的生产问题，不推行限额发料还是一样地进行生产。这些想法和做法当然都是错误的。我们知道，如果原材料供应得不及时、不齐备，企业的生产计划是很难完成的。即令是完成了产量计划，但是在材料使用上也会有很大浪费，成本也不能降低。
    目前在厂矿企业中推行限额发料制度是否已经具备了条件呢？应该说，条件是具备的。这几年，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，各个企业已经积累了一定的管理经验。国家制定了五年计划，工业的生产任务已经稳定下来。通过材料消耗定额的普查工作，产品的材料消耗定额也接近实际了。这些都是推行限额发料制度的极有利的条件。当然，目前也还有一些企业的生产任务没有完全确定下来，在这些企业里推行限额发料制度是有一些困难的。但是这些困难随着生产作业计划和生产技术管理的不断提高，都是可以克服的。这里最主要的，就是根据企业的现实条件，结合生产发展的要求，先从主要材料或主要车间开始试行，然后再逐步推广。
    根据一些厂矿企业的经验，推行限额发料制度，应该做好以下几项工作：
    第一，企业的生产计划要及时确定。计划定得迟了，就会造成原材料供应的困难；计划变动得大，就会造成一部分原材料积压，一部分原材料供应不足。因此，推行限额发料制度，首先就要建立正常的计划工作秩序。计划部门应该按时提供年的、季的和月的生产大纲和月份生产作业计划，工艺部门应该按时提供原材料的消耗定额。然后，供应部门根据这些指标，认真检查库存材料的足缺情况，精确计划车间材料的需用量和应该拨发的限额，使所规定的限额完全符合车间生产的需要。
    先进的材料消耗定额，是计算材料需用量的科学依据。由于材料管理的加强和生产技术的改进，材料消耗定额必然会不断地降低。因此，推行限额发料的过程，也就是材料消耗定额不断降低的过程。各企业的供应工作人员应该认真监督材料在生产中的耗用情况，不断修改落后了的定额，把它提高到先进的水平，从而逐步降低材料的拨发限额，最大限度地节约材料。
    第二，应该在仓库组织中配备一定的设备，集中地按照车间需要进行材料的切割、锯截、分类、分碎等加工工作。经验证明，集中下料，就能够节约金属的消耗量。如上海电机厂实行了矽钢片的套裁法，电动机的矽钢片节约了百分之十到十四点七，变压器的矽钢片节约了百分之十二。上海机床厂外圆磨床所用的钢板，由于按照绘制的图案集中剪裁，利用率提高百分之八。认真编制下料计划，也可以使长材、短材、料头、料边得到有效的利用，充分发挥企业的材料潜力。
    限额发料必须同送料制度相结合，要把应该发的原材料直接送达车间或工作地。因为车间工人到仓库里去领料，就会浪费有效的生产时间。实行送料制度，就可大大减少车间工人的辅助工作时间，提高劳动生产率。为了严格节约材料的消耗，还必须实行余料还库制度，并且按照限额回收废料。严格执行这一制度，就可避免车间相互串用材料，消灭车间“黑料”和减少废品废料的产生。
    有了周密的制度，还必须经常地认真地检查执行情况，防止制度流于形式。
    推行限额发料是节约原材料和减低产品成本的重要方法，它用科学的组织工作，把上千、万种的材料，以最节约的数量供应给车间。它也是推动整个企业改善经营管理的一个方法。企业的领导工作人员应该支持这一工作，在党的领导下，工会、青年团组织，也应该密切地配合，把这一工作在各地厂矿中广泛地开展起来，以便为国家积累更多的资金，保证完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划。
