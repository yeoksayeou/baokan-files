The Anyuan Coal Mine in Pingxiang, Jiangxi Province, has begun a full restoration. The drainage project for the Bafang Well, the main mine for producing coking coal, started ahead of schedule on November 21st, a year earlier than planned.

The Anyuan Coal Mine was founded in 1898. In 1939, the Kuomintang completely destroyed the Anyuan Coal Mine, and the Bafang Well was flooded. After liberation, exploration proved that a large amount of coking coal was still buried in this coalfield, so it was decided to fully restore it. Currently, batches of water pump drivers, winch operators, fitters, and hoisting and transport workers have entered the construction site. Elevators have hoisted giant cages weighing dozens of tons into the Bafang Well shaft. The electric water pumps on the cages are continuously pumping water out of the well at a rate of 20 tons per minute, day and night. It is estimated that all three million tons of foul water will be drained by March next year, at which time the mine can be repaired and the roadways developed.

    萍乡安源煤矿开始全面恢复
    江西省萍乡安源煤矿已经开始全面恢复。生产炼焦煤的主要矿井——八方井的排水工程已提前一年，在十一月二十一日动工。
    安源煤矿创办于一八九八年。一九三九年安源煤矿全部被国民党炸毁，八方井矿井被水淹没。解放后，经过钻探证明，在这块煤田上还埋藏着大量的炼焦煤，因此决定全面恢复。目前，成批的水泵司机、绞车司机、钳工和起重搬运工人进入了工地，升降机已经把几十吨重的巨型罐笼吊入八方井直井内，罐笼上的电动水泵以每分钟二十吨的排水量日夜不停地把积水抽出井外。预计明年三月将可以把三百万吨臭水全部排干，那时这个矿井就可以进行整修和开拓巷道。
