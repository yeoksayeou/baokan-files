Answering Readers' Questions

    Q: Why is it necessary to determine the share fund of an agricultural cooperative before issuing loans from the poor peasants' cooperative fund?

    A: The purpose of issuing loans from the poor peasants' cooperative fund is to help poor peasants overcome the difficulties of paying membership fees, so as to enhance the political and economic status of poor peasants within the cooperative, strengthen the unity between poor and middle peasants, and better implement the policy of mutual benefit. According to this purpose, before issuing the loan, the agricultural cooperative needs to determine the share fund of the members first. In this way, it can be known how much difficulty a poor peasant member has and how much loan is needed; and which members have no difficulty and do not need a loan. If the loan is issued before the agricultural cooperative determines the share fund of the members, it is very likely to produce problems such as the average distribution of loans among members or improper use, so that the loan cannot play its due role.

    Q: Can dependents of revolutionary martyrs, military service members, and small vendors in rural areas also apply for loans?

    A: The main targets of the poor peasants' cooperative fund loans are poor peasants and some lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants who have difficulties. If the family members of revolutionary martyrs, military service members, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed meet the above conditions and have difficulties in paying shares when joining the agricultural production cooperative, they must also be given loans from the poor peasants' cooperative fund, and the loan period should also be appropriately extended.

    Those who were urban poor or rural small vendors in the past and have now participated in agricultural production can also be given loans from the poor peasants' cooperative fund if their economic conditions were equivalent to those of poor peasants or lower-middle peasants when they joined the agricultural production cooperative.

    Q: How should the scope of loan recipients and the amount to be loaned to each household be controlled?

    A: The economic conditions of various regions are very uneven. Therefore, the scope of loan recipients and the amount to be loaned to each household should also vary according to the different conditions in different regions. For example, in economic crop areas and bumper harvest areas, the scope of loan recipients should be smaller, and the amount of loans per household can be larger; in barren areas and disaster areas, the scope of loans can be wider, and the amount of loans per household should be smaller; in general areas, the scope of loan recipients and the amount of loans per household should be smaller than in barren areas and disaster areas. Judging from the overall situation in the country, the scope of poor peasant loan recipients joining the cooperative is about 30% to 40%, but it should vary from place to place.

    The amount of loan per household should be determined after the agricultural cooperative has determined the share fund of each member, and should be issued according to the principle of "lend more to those who lack more, lend less to those who lack less, and do not lend to those who do not lack," and should not be distributed equally according to the number of poor peasant members.

    Q: Can the expenses shared for organizing sideline production by the agricultural cooperative also be loaned?

    A: There are two uses for the poor peasants' cooperative fund loans: one is the shared price of the production expenses to be paid by the members in the current year; the other is the price of the main means of production that have been valued and returned to the cooperative and should be shared by each household. The former use includes sideline production expenses. The "Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party mentioned that agricultural production cooperatives must take a series of measures to ensure the growth of agricultural productivity, which stated: "According to local conditions and under the planned guidance of local state organs, develop a multi-sectoral economy including agriculture and handicrafts, animal husbandry, forestry, fruit and forestry, or fisheries and other sideline occupations." Therefore, the use of the poor peasants' cooperative fund loan should include sideline production expenses. However, the sideline production expenses that need to be loaned from the poor peasants' cooperative fund must be the shared portion of the members.

    Q: Can the leading organs at the township level approve the targets and amounts of the poor peasants' cooperative fund loans?

    A: The work of the poor peasants' cooperative fund loan has a great effect on implementing the Party's class policy in rural areas; in order to avoid deviations and to summarize experiences well and lay the foundation for issuing this loan in large quantities in the future, the district-level leading organs should approve the targets and amounts of this loan in the pilot work. This is absolutely necessary. However, with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the future, the number of farmers joining the agricultural cooperative is increasing day by day. If the poor peasants' cooperative fund loan is still approved by the district-level leading organs, not only will the time be too late, but the district will not be able to know the economic situation of every poor peasant in the district in detail. At the same time, various places have also gained a lot of experience in pilot work. Therefore, the targets and the amount to be loaned to each household of the poor peasants' cooperative fund loan can be reviewed and approved by the Party and government leading organs at the township level in the future, but bank cadres and cooperative office cadres must be absorbed to participate in the review work. This will make the problem solved more timely and more perfect. However, bank business offices should often check the loan work and solve the problems in time.

    Q: When applying for a loan from the poor peasants' cooperative fund, can the members collectively sign a contract?

    A: The poor peasants' cooperative fund loan is aimed at individual members, so when applying for the loan, the members should sign a contract with the bank individually, and the members should repay the loan individually after the loan is due, but the agricultural cooperative should handle the procedures uniformly when borrowing and repaying. However, if all the loans issued in large quantities in the future are signed by individual members, this work will be too heavy. Therefore, the poor peasant loan recipients of the agricultural cooperative can also collectively sign a contract with the bank, and a detailed list of loan recipients should be attached to the back of the contract, indicating how much each household has borrowed, and the list of loan recipients and the amount of loans must be written clearly and correctly. In this way, the work of the bank can be reduced and the farmers can be facilitated.

    有关贫农合作基金贷款的几个问题
    答读者问
    问：为什么在发放贫农合作基金贷款以前，先要确定农业社的股份基金？
    答：发放贫农合作基金贷款的目的，是为了帮助贫农解决入社费用的困难，以便提高贫农在社内的政治地位和经济地位，加强贫农、中农之间的团结，更好地贯彻互利政策。根据这一目的，在贷款发放以前，就需要农业社先确定社员股份基金。这样，才能知道那个贫农社员有多大困难，需要贷多少款；那个社员没有困难，不需要贷款。如果在农业社确定社员股份基金以前就发放贷款，就很可能产生社员平均分配贷款或有用途不正当等毛病，使贷款不能起到应有的作用。
    问：农村的烈属、军属以及小商贩是否也可以贷款呢？
    答：贫农合作基金贷款的主要对象是贫农和个别有困难的新、老中农中间的下中农。军属、烈属和老弱孤寡等，如果合乎以上条件，在参加农业生产合作社的时候缴纳股金有困难，也必须贷给贫农合作基金贷款，而且贷款期限还应该适当延长一些。
    过去是城市贫民或农村小商贩而现在已经参加了农业生产的人，在他们参加农业生产合作社的时候，如果当时经济条件相当于贫农或下中农，也可以贷给贫农合作基金贷款。
    问：贷款户的面和每户应贷的数目应该怎样掌握？
    答：各地的经济情况是很不平衡的，因此贷款户的面和每户应贷的数目，也应该根据各地的不同情况有所不同。例如：在经济作物区和丰收地区，贷款户的面就应小一些，每户贷款的数目可以多一些；在贫瘠地区和灾区，贷款的面就可以宽一些，每户贷款的数目要小一些；在一般地区，贷款户的面和每户应贷的数目，应该比贫瘠地区和灾区再小一些。从全国总的情况看来，入社贫农贷款户的面大约在百分之三十到四十，但是各地应有所不同。
    每户贷款数目的多少，要在农业社确定了每个社员的股份基金以后，根据“多缺的人多贷，少缺的人少贷，不缺的人不贷”的原则发放，不能按照贫农社员的数目平均分配。
    问：农业社组织副业生产所平摊的费用，是否也可以贷款呢？
    答：贫农合作基金贷款的用途有两项：一项是社员应缴纳的当年生产费用平摊价款；另一项是已经作价归社的主要生产资料每户应平摊的价款。前一项用途中，就包括副业生产费用在内。党的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”中提到，农业生产合作社必须采取一系列的措施，来保证农业生产力的增长，其中说：“按照当地的条件，并且在地方国家机关的计划指导下，发展包括农业和手工业、畜牧业、林业、果木业或渔业等副业的多部门经济。”因此，贫农合作基金贷款的用途内，就应该包括副业生产费用在内。但是，副业生产费用需要贷用贫农合作基金贷款的，必须是属于社员的平摊部分。
    问：乡一级的领导机关是否可以批准贫农合作基金贷款的对象和数额呢？
      答：贫农合作基金贷款这一项工作，对贯彻执行党在农村的阶级政策有很大的作用；为了不致于出偏差，并且很好地总结经验，给今后大量发放好这项贷款打下基础，所以在试点工作中由区一级领导机关批准这项贷款的对象和数额。这是完全必要的。但是，随着今后农业合作化运动的发展，参加农业社的农户一天比一天增多了。如果贫农合作基金贷款还由区一级领导机关批准，不但时间上来不及，而且区里也不可能对全区每户贫农的经济情况都知道的很细致。同时，各地在试点工作中也已经取得了不少经验。因此，今后贫农合作基金贷款的对象和每户应贷的数额，可以由乡一级党、政领导机关审查批准，但是必须吸收银行干部和办社干部参加审查工作。这样就会使问题解决得更及时、更完善。但是银行营业所应该经常对贷款工作进行检查，发现问题及时解决。
    问：贷用贫农合作基金贷款的时候，是否可以由社员集体立约？
    答：贫农合作基金贷款是以社员个人为贷款对象的，所以在贷款的时候应该由社员个人向银行立约，贷款到期后由社员个人偿还，只是在借款和还款的时候由农业社统一办理手续。但是，如果今后大量发放的贷款都由社员个人立约，这项工作就过于繁重。因此，也可以由农业社的贫农贷款户集体向银行立约，契约后面附上一个贷款户的详细名单，写明那一户贷了多少，贷款户名单和贷款数目必须写得清楚不错。这样，就可以减轻银行的工作，也便利了农民。
