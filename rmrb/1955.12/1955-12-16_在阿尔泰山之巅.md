    On the Summit of the Altai Mountains
    Chu Anping
    As soon as I arrived in Altay, I went to visit one of the main peaks of the Altai Mountains. On the day we went up the mountain, the weather was fine below, but halfway up, it started to rain, followed by sparse snowflakes in the rain, and further up, a blizzard, a vast expanse of white. It wasn't even Mid-Autumn Festival yet, but it already felt like the dead of winter, and we were all dressed in leather clothes and hats. When we arrived at our destination, we saw many small but charming wooden houses on the mountain. The mountain was full of rocks, with no trees. Each wooden house was built on a small patch of ground leveled out among the rocks on the hillside.

    This is indeed a place that requires people to fight nature with great courage, wisdom, and perseverance. This is a place that tests and tempers the minds and bodies of everyone. However, under the education of the great Party, people are always able to withstand the test, temper themselves in difficulties, and create arduous achievements. In the autumn of 1951, when people first came to this summit to explore for minerals, there was nothing on the mountain except rocks. Fifty or sixty of them were crowded into two tents, and the stoves were set up in the open air. The mountain was high and the weather was cold, and the food often didn't cook properly; sometimes, even Soviet experts had to join everyone in gnawing on cold buns. Because there were no trees on the mountain, both the firewood for burning and the wood for building the houses had to be felled in the forests below and carried up. Most of them went down the mountain to carry wood after work. In 1952, two air compressors arrived, but they could not be transported up the mountain. The machines had to be dismantled into parts and then carried up the mountain by livestock. After the machines were installed, they also needed fuel, which also had to be carried by horses. But the snow on the mountain was thick, and the livestock could only carry it to a place eight kilometers away from the summit. Further up, it had to be carried by people. At that time, some people were specifically assigned to carry oil, and they could only carry enough for each day's burning. Especially during the snowmelt season, carrying oil was even more difficult. The snow underneath had melted, but the snow on top hadn't, and sometimes it took a lot of effort to pull one's foot out after stepping into it. So they had to carry it at night, because the temperature was lower at night and the ice was thicker. They would set off at one o'clock in the morning and not arrive until nine or ten o'clock in the morning. But in order not to stop production, no one succumbed to the difficulties.

    In 1954, the Metal Company opened a road in these deep gullies, steep slopes, and cliffs. But even with a road, transportation up and down the mountain could not be guaranteed year-round. Before October, ten-wheeled trucks with iron chains could barely make it up the mountain, but after October, the heavy snow closed the mountain, and cars could no longer reach the summit directly. Due to climate restrictions, the mine headquarters usually had to seize the two or three months of June, July, and August to transport all the production materials needed by the mine for the year, such as machinery, fuel, explosives, various parts, as well as the food, firewood, and daily necessities for all employees for the year, to the mountain. This was not a simple or easy task. The new road was opened to traffic on September 1, 1954, but soon after it opened, it entered the snowy season, so that some of the materials could not be fully transported before the deadline. After that, they continued to use cars, animal power, and human power for segmented transportation. Where cars could not reach, they switched to using oxen to pull. Where oxen could not pull, they switched to carrying by people. But even with oxen pulling, people still had to step out a path in front. If no one cleared the way for the oxen first, the oxen would fall into the snowdrifts beside the road. Starting in late January of this year, the mountain was hit by half a month of continuous snow, and the fuel supply was forced to stop, affecting production. The Party mobilized all the employees on the mountain and at the mine headquarters in Altay City to participate in the great snow-sweeping struggle. One group swept down from the mountain, and the other group swept up from the foot of the mountain. It took more than six thousand man-days to finally open a corridor more than eighty kilometers long in the three-meter to more than ten-meter deep snow. In February of this year, due to another urgent task, the people on the mountain had to go down the mountain, but the snow was thick on the road. When people walked in the snow, the snow was already up to their chests, but their feet had not yet touched the ground. The Party organized a commando team of thirty or forty people, and these thirty or forty people spent four days opening the nine-kilometer road from Erdao Fangzi to Daqiao. This is how people heroically, under the leadership of the Party, waged a tenacious struggle against the harsh natural environment.

    The situation was the same in production. The workers were working non-stop in three shifts day and night. No matter how cold the weather was, they generally persisted in working, except in the event of particularly heavy wind and snow. Sometimes, when the heavy snow buried the rails, the Party immediately sent people to sweep the snow every one or two hundred meters to maintain transportation. Some people erected many wooden stakes on both sides of the tracks and nailed wooden boards to block the wind and snow on both sides. When the wind was strong, two people could not push the iron car, so they added two more people to push together. The weather was indeed cold, but the working people were still covered in sweat. When many workers got off work, their hats and clothes were covered with icicles, and their beards, temples, and even their body hair were covered with frost. Not only did no one complain about the weather, but the weather became the most intimate witness of the great working class's selfless labor.

    On the second day of going up the mountain, I woke up early in the morning and rushed to look at the sky, fearing that it would be like yesterday, with fog all over the mountain and nothing to see. Fortunately, the sky was full of sun that day, and there was no wind. We lived at an altitude of about 2,700 meters, and to get to the mine on the top of the mountain, we had to go up another 200 meters. There was a snow cliff, which was steep and slippery, with some wooden stakes erected along the edge, with thick cables tied to them for people to climb. I grabbed the cables and struggled to walk up, my nerves and muscles strained to the extreme. However, no matter how difficult it was, as long as I didn't fall behind, it was victory; I finally reached the highest mining area on this peak.

    The scene in the mining area was lively. We first saw a large recessed open-pit hole, which was an open-pit mine that had already been mined. Now another higher place was being mined. When we arrived, it had just been blasted, and we saw many pushing workers busy loading the blasted rocks into iron hopper cars and pushing them to the ore dressing platform through light rails. There were also some workers climbing on very high and steep cliffs, using iron bars to pry down the rocks that could be pried down by manpower. On the ore dressing platform, there were many male and female ore dressing workers holding small hammers waiting. They carefully selected from the ore; often, only a very small amount was selected from a hopper car. Those places where waste ore was piled up were called "tailings," and many tailings were like neat long dikes, creating another new spectacle for this high mountain. After we visited the open-pit mine, we also saw an underground mine. The entrance of the tunnel was covered with icicles, and there was deep water on both sides of the rails in the cave. There was a very deep shaft in the tunnel, and deeper drilling work was being carried out at the bottom of the shaft. As I walked through the tunnel, I saw sparkling points of light everywhere in the darkness. This scene seemed to take me into a world of mythology, so beautiful and full of magical meaning. When we came out of the tunnel and returned to the top of the mountain, we saw the giant rocks on the nearby mountain ridges, some of which pierced the sky like sharp bayonets. The clouds were constantly floating under the mountain, and as far as the eye could see were the boundless mountains and valleys. What a broad, majestic, and magnificent scene! However, in such a desolate summit of a mountain, a modern mechanized industrial site appeared, where brave people were tirelessly engaged in creative labor. When I was a child, I often listened to old people telling myths about finding gems during summer evenings, and now, I have traveled thousands of miles, climbed a mountain of three thousand meters, and finally saw with my own eyes such a vivid and great treasure digging picture. This is neither a bizarre myth, nor just the activities of one or two explorers. This is a true reality, this is an immortal feat established for the country.

    I lived on this high mountain for three days. The deepest impression I got during this short visit was the kind of incredibly tenacious fighting will represented by the stories I described earlier, as well as the revolutionary optimism that permeated the conversations of the people I came into contact with. Some young lads, giggling and laughing, everything difficult in their speech seemed to turn into the most relaxing story. Some of them said: "We can't compare with the inland, we are on the frontier of the motherland, we are developing the frontier of the motherland!" They said that when they thought of these, they felt that their work had a special meaning, and thus gained endless strength. When the heavy wind and snow came, they thought of the heroic examples in the book "Far from Moscow," and the heroic images of Alexei, Dania, Genka, etc. immediately appeared before them, making them particularly brave and firm. ... However, all these touching impressions led me into a deeper feeling: the more remote the border area, the more desolate the place, the deeper the mountains and ridges, and the more severe the wind and snow, the more people deeply feel the powerful strength of the great Party! In our country, in the new era, the most profound and greatest thing is that the powerful light of this powerful Party reaches everywhere in the country! We cannot imagine: in such a deep mountain in the border area of the motherland, with such harsh natural conditions, if there were no Party, no Party leadership and support, people would create such brilliant achievements in such a desolate place! We can't even imagine: in today's China, how can there not be the light of the Party shining in any remote corner or any steep mountain! Wherever there is a Party, there is heroic struggle, and there is creative labor! On this summit of the mountain, precisely because there is the Party, the Party's leadership, and the Party's continuous education, people can recognize the value of their work and the meaning of life. The Party not only leads people to fight against nature, but also leads people to educate themselves; the Party not only organizes people to produce, but also teaches people how to live. On this summit of the mountain, just like in other parts of the motherland, there is also political study and cultural study, and there is also a vigorous patriotic labor competition. On the mountain, there are three broadcasts a day, with news and music. There are two movies every week, and sometimes there are dances on weekends. There is a library, a clinic, a postal and telecommunications agency, and a mining area trading company on the mountain. Although the conditions are difficult, life is entirely created by oneself.

    For many years, our country has been mired in a dark, powerless, and almost paralyzed state. But after liberation, the whole country, like a long-cloudy field after the first sunshine, is full of sunshine and growing vigorously. Everyone and every place is working and creating. They are creating wealth and creating history. The battle on the Altai Mountains is only a corner of the ten-thousand-mile battlefield of the country; the poems it has created are only a line in the great chorus of the era. What I saw on the summit of the mountain in three days makes me even more convinced that under the leadership of the great Party, our country will inevitably become stronger and stronger and will victoriously enter socialism step by step.

    在阿尔泰山之巅
    储安平
    我一到阿勒泰，就去访问了阿尔泰山的一个主峰。上山那天，下面还是好好的天气，可是走到半路上，便落起雨来，接着在雨中飘着疏疏落落的雪花，再上去则风雪弥漫，放目四顾，侭是白茫茫的一片了。那时还没有到中秋，可是已经很像严冬景象，我们都穿戴上皮衣皮帽了。到了目的地，看到山上盖着好多幢虽然很小然而饶有风趣的木屋。山上尽是岩石，没有树木。每幢木屋都是在山坡的乱石中铲平了一小块地面盖起来的。
    这确实是一个要求人们以极大的勇敢、智慧和忍耐同自然进行搏斗的地方。这是一个考验并锻炼每一个人的心志体魄的地方。然而在伟大的党的教育下，人们总是能够经受考验，在困难中锻炼自己，并创造出艰巨的业绩的。一九五一年秋天，人们勘探矿藏初到这个山巅，山上除了岩石以外，什么都没有。他们五六十个人密密地挤在两个帐篷里，锅灶安置在露天里，山高天气冷，经常煮不熟饭；有时苏联专家也只能陪着大家啃冷馍。由于山上没有树木，无论是烧的柴火或是架屋的木料，都要到下面的森林里采伐了再背上来。他们大都下了班就下山去背木料。一九五二年，到了两部空气压缩机，可是运不上山来，要把机器拆成零件，再用牲口驮上山。机器装好了，还要燃料，也得用马驮。但是山上雪厚，牲口也只能驮到离山头八公里的地方，再往上就得改用人背。那时专门抽出了一部分人背油，每天背的也只够每天烧。特别在化雪季节，背油更困难，底下的雪化了，面上的雪还没化，有时一脚踏下去，要费很大力气才能拔起脚来。所以只好改在夜里背，因为夜晚气温低，冰比较厚，从午夜一点出发，到早上九、十点钟才能背到。但是为了不使生产停止，没有一个人在困难前面屈服。
    一九五四年，金属公司在这深沟、险坡和悬崖的山岭间开辟了一条公路。但是有了公路也保证不了山上山下终年通运。在十月以前，十轮卡车扣上铁链，还可以勉强上山，十月以后，雪大封山，汽车就不能直达山顶了。由于气候的限制，通常矿本部总要抓紧在六、七、八这两三个月里把矿上一年中需要的生产资料，如机器、燃料、爆炸器材、各式零件以及所有职工一年中的食物、木柴和生活用品都运到山上。这并不是一个简单轻易的任务。这条新公路是在一九五四年九月一日通车的，但通车不久，就进入了雪季，以致一部分物资没有能够在限期以前全部运足。以后继续用汽车、兽力、人力分段运输。在汽车不能到达的地方，改用牛拖。牛也拖不上的地方，再用人背。但是用牛拖也仍得人先在前面踏出一条路来。假如没有人先替牛开道，牛就会掉进路旁的雪窝里去。今年一月下旬起，山上连续落了半个月雪，燃料的供应被迫中断，影响了生产。党发动了所有山上的和阿勒泰城里矿本部的职工参加了伟大的扫雪斗争。一头从山上扫下来，一头从山脚下扫上去，花了六千多个人工，终于在三公尺到十几公尺的积雪里打通了一条八十多公里长的走廊。今年二月里，由于另一件迫切的任务，山上的人要下山，但是路上雪厚，人在雪里走，雪虽已陷到胸口，而脚还没有着地。党组织了一个三四十人的开路突击队，这三四十个人花了四天工夫，才把从二道房子到大桥之间的九公里路打开。人们就是这样英勇地在党的领导下同险恶的自然环境进行着顽强不屈的斗争。
    在生产上，情形也是一样。工人们都是日夜三班地不停息地生产着。无论天气如何严寒，除了遇着特大的风雪以外，一般都坚持工作。有时，大雪把铁轨埋了，党就立刻派人在每一二百公尺之间现下现扫，来维持运输交通。有的就在轨道两旁竖上许多木桩，钉上木板，借以挡拦两边的风雪。风大的时候，两个人推不动铁车，就再加上两个人一起推。天气确实是寒冷的，但是劳动着的人，仍然一身是汗。很多工人下班的时候，帽子上衣服上都挂着冰凌，胡须、鬓发甚至汗毛都沾着冰霜。不仅没有人抱怨天气，天气反而成了伟大工人阶级忘我劳动的最亲切的证人。
    上山第二天，清早一醒，我就忙着看天，深怕又像昨天那样，满山迷雾，什么都瞧不见。所幸那天满天太阳，也不刮风。我们住的地方大约海拔二千七百多公尺，要到山顶上的采矿场，还要上行二百多公尺。有一个雪崖，又陡又滑，沿边竖着一些木桩，上面系着粗大的缆索，供人攀援。我一把一把攀着缆索奋力走上去，神经和肌肉都紧张到极点。然而不管怎样困难，只要不中途掉队，就是胜利；我终于到达了这个高峰上最高处的采矿场。
    矿场上的情景是生动的。我们先看到一个很大的凹了进去的露天窟窿，这是已经开采过了的一个露天采矿场。现在另一个更高的地方正在被开采着。我们到达的时候，刚爆炸过，看到很多推运工人正在忙碌地把被炸开了的石块装进铁斗车里，通过轻便铁轨推送到选矿的平台上去。另外还有一些工人攀登在很高很陡的山崖上，用铁杠把那些可以用人力扳下来的岩石扳下来。在选矿的平台上，有着很多手持小锤的男女选矿工人在守候着。他们从矿石里细心挑拣；常常一铁斗车倒下来，拣到的只有很少很少一点。那些堆积废矿石的地方被称为“矿尾”，很多矿尾就像一条一条齐整的长堤，为这高山构成了另一种新的奇景。我们参观了露天矿以后，又看了一个地下矿。隧道的入口处挂满了冰凌，洞内铁轨的两边都有很深的积水。隧道里有一口很深很深的竖井，在竖井底层进行着更深一层的钻探工作。我穿行在那隧道里，看到在黑暗中到处都发射着点点闪亮，这情景仿佛一下子把我带进了一个神话的世界里，那样美又那样充满着神奇的意味。我们从隧道里出来，再回到山顶，看到远近山脊上的巨石，有的就像锋利的刺刀一样刺入天心，云在山下不断地穿浮，放眼所及是旷无边际的千山万壑，这是何等旷达、雄伟而又壮丽的景色！然而就在这样一个荒寒的大山之巅，却出现了一个现代化机械化的工业场地，勇敢的人们在那儿不懈地进行着创造性的劳动。小时候，夏夜纳凉，常听老年人讲述一些寻觅宝石的神话，而现在，我经历了千万里的路程，登上了三千公尺的高山，终于亲眼看到了这样一幅生动而伟大的挖宝图。这既不是怪诞的神话，也不仅仅是一两个探险家的活动，这是真切的现实，这是为国家创立下的不朽的勋业。
    我在这高山上住了三天。在这短促的访问中，我得到的最深刻的印象，就是我在前面叙述过的那些故事所代表着的那种无比坚韧的战斗意志，以及我所接触过的那些人在谈话中洋溢着的革命乐观主义精神。有些年青小伙子，嘻嘻哈哈，边说边笑，一切困难的事情在他们的谈吐里仿佛都变成了最轻松的故事。他们有的说：“我们这儿不能和内地比呀，我们是在祖国的边疆，我们是在开发祖国的边疆啊！”他们说，当他们一想到这些，就感到自己的工作有着特殊的意义，从而获得了无穷的力量。当大风雪袭来的时候，他们就想起“远离莫斯科的地方”一书中的那些英勇榜样，阿列克塞、丹妮亚、根卡等人的英雄形象立刻呈现在他们眼前，使他们格外勇敢坚定。……然而这一切感人的印象又引导我进入一种更深沉的感念：越是边域遥远、地方荒奥、山深岭高、风雪袭人，就越使人深切感到强大的党的强大的力量！在我们的国家里，在新生的时代中，最最深刻巨大的事情是这个强大的党的强大的光芒在全国无所不达！我们不能想像：在祖国边疆这样一个深奥的大山中，自然条件这样险恶，要是没有党、没有党的领导和支持，人们会在这样荒寒的地方创造出这样光辉的成绩！我们更不能想像：在今天中国，不论是怎样一个荒僻的角落或者怎样一座峻险的高山，怎会没有党的光芒的照耀！无论什么地方，只要有党，就有英勇的斗争，就有创造性的劳动！在这个高山之巅，正因为有了党，有了党的领导和党的不断的教育，人们才能认清自己工作的价值和生活的意义。党不仅领导人们同自然搏斗，党还领导人们教育自己；党不仅组织人们生产，党还教导人们如何生活。在这个大山之巅，正如在祖国其他地方一样，也有着政治学习和文化学习，也进行着轰轰烈烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛。在山上，一天有三次广播，既有新闻，又有音乐。每星期有两次电影，有时周末还有舞会。山上有图书馆，有医疗所，有邮电代办所，有矿区贸易公司。条件虽然艰苦，但生活全凭自己创造。
    多少年代以来，我们的国家一直沉沦在黑暗的、有劲使不出的、近乎瘫痪的境地里。可是解放以后，全国就像久阴初晴的原野一样，到处阳光焕发，生意蒸长。每个人，每块地方，都在劳动着，创造着。他们既创造财富，又创造历史。阿尔泰山上的战斗只是全国万里战场上的一角；它所缔造的诗篇也只是时代大合唱中的一行。三天山巅所见，使人更加坚信，在伟大的党的领导下，我们的国家必然日趋强大，并将按步胜利地进入社会主义。
