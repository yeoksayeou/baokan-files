Vice-President, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　At the invitation of the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru, I came to New Delhi yesterday to visit our great neighbor, India. I received a very warm welcome from the Indian government and people. Tonight, Your Excellency is hosting this banquet and giving me the opportunity to meet friends from many fields. I am honored and grateful for all of this. I cannot help but be deeply moved when my long-held desire to visit India is finally realized, especially during this epoch-making period in world history that we are all proud of. Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, Mr. Vice President, and through you to the Indian government and people. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the leader of India, the distinguished statesman and peace fighter, and my good friend, Mr. Nehru. Without Mr. Nehru, there would be no such pleasant gathering tonight.

　　The relationship between China and India, as Prime Minister Nehru said during his visit to China last winter, "India and China have coexisted in an atmosphere of perfect friendship and mutual harmony since the dawn of history." The history of our two countries records only the continuous exchange of culture and economy. This rare but natural tradition of peaceful coexistence between countries has always been the foundation of Sino-Indian relations. In modern times, the people of our two countries have consistently fought against foreign colonialist aggression and oppression and for their own freedom and independence. In the face of our common difficulties, our mutual sympathy and understanding have deepened, and this sympathy and understanding will never be forgotten. After the establishment of our new countries, our traditional friendship has been further strengthened.

　　We both hope to build our respective countries in a peaceful environment. Since the liberation of our country, we have made great progress in China, and now we are working hard to complete our first five-year plan. We are also fully aware of the rapid progress India has made in recent years. I hope that during my short visit to India, I will be able to take the opportunity to learn from your achievements and experiences. Our common desire for peace is the basis for further developing friendship and cooperation. The historic Five Principles, "Panchsheel," are now not only a guide for the relationship between our two countries, but are also being accepted by more and more countries, which is very gratifying. Peaceful coexistence has now become an objective need. The peace-loving people of India have made valuable contributions to establishing Panchsheel, expanding the zone of peace, easing international tensions, and consolidating the solidarity of Asian and African countries in the process of anti-colonialism.

　　The Chinese people will never forget the position of support for China taken by our Indian friends on the issue of the tense situation in the Taiwan region of China and on the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. We are grateful for the support of the Indian people. We can assure the Indian people that in their struggle to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India, they can always count on the heartfelt support of the Chinese people. Both of our countries are working hard to get rid of our economic backwardness. Therefore, our cooperation in the economic field is of great significance. In the past few years, our cultural exchanges have also increased. Our closer cooperation and mutual assistance will undoubtedly not only benefit our own countries, but will also help ensure peace and progress in Asia and the world.

　　Now, please allow me, Your Excellency the Vice President, to propose a toast to your health, to the friendship and cooperation between China and India, to the prosperity and prosperity of your country, and to the happiness of your great people.

    在印度副总统拉德哈克里希南举行的欢迎宴会上
    宋庆龄副委员长的讲话尊敬的副总统阁下，女士们，先生们：
    我应印度政府和尼赫鲁总理阁下的邀请，昨天到新德里来访问我们的伟大的邻邦——印度。我受到了印度政府和人民非常热烈的欢迎。今天晚上阁下设宴招待，并且使我有机会同许多方面的朋友会见。对这一切，我感到荣幸并且表示感谢。当我长时期怀抱的访问印度的愿望终于实现的时候，特别是在我们大家都感到骄傲的世界历史的这个划时代的时期中实现，我不能不深深感动。请允许我向您，副总统先生，并且通过您向印度政府和人民表示我衷心的感谢。我还要向印度的领袖、卓越的政治家和和平战士、我的好朋友尼赫鲁先生表示我的真诚的感谢。没有尼赫鲁先生，就不可能有今晚这样愉快的聚会。
    中印两国的关系，正像总理阁下在去年冬天访问中国的时候所说的：“从历史的黎明开始，印度和中国一直就在完美的友谊和相互和谐的气氛中共处着。”我们两国的历史上所纪录的，只有文化和经济的不断交流。这种难得的然而很自然的国与国和平共处的传统一直是中印两国关系的基础。在近代，我们两国人民一直一贯地在为反对外国殖民主义的侵略和压迫和争取自己的自由和独立而进行斗争。在我们共同的困难面前，我们相互的同情和谅解加深了，这种同情和谅解是永远不会被忘记的。在我们的新国家建立起来以后，我们的传统的友谊已经得到更进一步的加强。
    我们共同希望在和平的环境中建设我们各自的国家。自从我国解放以来，我们在中国已经有了很大的进步，现在我们正在努力完成我们的第一个五年计划。我们也充分注意到印度在最近几年中所获得的迅速进步。我希望我在访问印度的短短的时期内，将能够利用机会学习你们的成就和经验。我们的争取和平的共同愿望是进一步发展友谊和合作的基础。历史性的五项原则，“潘查希拉”，现在不仅成了我们两国之间的关系的指针，而且正在被越来越多的国家所接受，这是一件非常令人欣慰的事情。和平共处现在已经成了一种客观需要。爱好和平的印度人民在确立潘查希拉、扩大和平地区、缓和国际紧张局势和巩固亚非国家在反殖民主义的过程中的团结方面，已经作出了很宝贵的贡献。
    中国人民永远不会忘记我们的印度朋友在中国的领土台湾地区的紧张局势问题上，以及在恢复中国在联合国的合法权利问题上所采取的支持中国的立场。我们对印度人民的支持表示感谢。我们可以向印度人民保证，在他们的保卫印度领土和主权完整的斗争中，他们永远可以指望中国人民的衷心支持。我们两个国家都在努力摆脱我们的经济落后状态。所以我们在经济领域内的合作是具有重大意义的。在过去几年中，我们的文化交流也有了增加。我们的更密切的合作和互助，毫无疑问的不仅将有利于我们自己的国家，而且也将有助于保证亚洲和世界的和平和进步。
    现在，请允许我，尊敬的副总统，建议为您的健康、为中国和印度的友谊和合作、为贵国的昌盛繁荣以及贵国伟大人民的幸福而干杯。
