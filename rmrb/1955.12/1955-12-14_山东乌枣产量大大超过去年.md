Shandong Province's Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Tai'an regions, which are abundant in black dates, saw their black date production more than double this year compared to last year. This year, farmers carried out soil preparation and fertilization for the jujube trees in the spring, strengthened technical management such as disease and pest control, and processed the red dates into black dates in a timely manner in the autumn, resulting in a much higher quality of black dates than in previous years.

At present, Shandong Provincial Native Produce Company has already shipped more than 16 million jin of black dates to more than ten provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. In addition, 2 million jin have been shipped abroad. (Our correspondent in Jinan)

    山东乌枣产量大大超过去年
    山东省盛产乌枣的德州、聊城、泰安三个专区，今年乌枣的产量超过去年两倍多。由于今年春天农民们对枣树进行了整土施肥，加强了防治病虫害等技术管理工作，秋季又适时地将红枣加工成乌枣，今年乌枣质量大大超过往年。
    目前，山东省土产公司已经把一千六百多万斤乌枣，源源运往北京、上海、浙江、广东等十多个省市，另外有二百万斤已经运往国外。（本报驻济南记者）
