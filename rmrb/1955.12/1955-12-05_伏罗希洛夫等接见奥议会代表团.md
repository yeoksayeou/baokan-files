Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS - Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Foreign Affairs, received members of the Austrian parliamentary delegation, who are currently visiting the Soviet Union, at the Kremlin on the 3rd.

Voroshilov, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, first extended his welcome to the guests. He emphasized that the mutual dispatch of parliamentary delegations and various other delegations between countries allows the people of each country to get closer. This not only eases international tensions but also lays the foundation for rational, humane, and friendly relations, under which all issues can be resolved in a spirit of mutual understanding.

The head of the delegation, Federal Council Chairman Frisch, said: Encounters with the Soviet people confirm that we can call each other friends. I believe that many prejudices and misunderstandings arising from absurd propaganda have now been eliminated, which achieves the purpose of our visit to the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the Austrian State Treaty has laid a good foundation for the expansion and consolidation of relations between the two countries.

Molotov said that the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference did not make a positive decision on developing international contacts, but this does not mean at all that what is not successful today will certainly not be successful tomorrow. He pointed out that the Soviet government will do its utmost to develop and support contacts between Soviet scientists, social activists, and artists with representatives of other countries. Our purpose is to hope that these contacts will be beneficial to both our country and other countries and promote better mutual understanding, cooperation, and friendship between countries.

Speaking of the Austrian State Treaty that made Austria neutral, Molotov pointed out that now, in addition to Switzerland, there is another neutral country in Europe, which is important to the people of all countries. We are against the establishment of military blocs around the world, especially in Europe, because it was in Europe that the First and Second World Wars broke out due to the establishment of various military blocs. Molotov expressed his belief that Austria's neutral policy, which is in line with the interests and sentiments of the Austrian people, will be consistently and honestly implemented. Molotov said that on this basis, we are your friends in political, economic, and cultural aspects.

Mikoyan agreed with Molotov's views. He also emphasized that there are no outstanding issues in the relations between the Soviet Union and Austria, and the Soviet government will solemnly fulfill all obligations stipulated in the existing treaties and agreements. Our starting point in this regard is that the Austrian side will also abide by the signed treaties. Mikoyan pointed out that the remnants of distrust and prejudice in mutual relations must be eliminated. To this end, there must be more contact and truthful reporting. And the visit of the Austrian parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union will contribute to this to no small extent.

When Voroshilov bid farewell to the Austrian parliamentarians, he asked them to convey the sincere greetings of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the Austrian Parliament, Federal President Körner, and Federal Chancellor Raab.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS - The Austrian parliamentary delegation, headed by Chairman of the Federal Council of the Republic of Austria, Frisch, left Moscow for home on the 4th, after a visit of approximately two weeks to the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Before leaving the Soviet Union, Frisch issued a statement to the press, expressing gratitude for the cordial hospitality of the Soviet authorities and residents. The statement said that the scale and perseverance of the Soviet people in carrying out peaceful reconstruction left a deep impression on the delegation. This peaceful reconstruction proves that the Soviet people, like the people of other countries, hope for peace and strive for peace. The Austrian parliamentary delegation believes that the visit it has made is a major contribution to the development of friendly relations between the people of the two countries.

    伏罗希洛夫等接见奥议会代表团
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬和苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫三日在克里姆林宫接见了现在苏联访问的奥地利议会代表团人员。
    伏罗希洛夫代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联政府首先向来宾们表示欢迎。他强调指出，各国之间互派议会代表团和其他各种代表团使各国人民得以接近。这不仅使国际紧张局势缓和，而且为理智的人道的友好关系奠定基础，在这种关系下一切问题都可以在相互谅解的精神下求得解决。
    代表团团长、联邦院主席弗里希说：同苏联人民的会晤证实，我们可以彼此称为朋友。我认为，出自荒谬宣传的许多偏见和误解现在消除了，这就达到了我们访问苏联的目的。他指出，奥地利国家条约已为两国关系的扩大和巩固奠定了良好的基础。
    莫洛托夫说，日内瓦四国外交部长会议没有作出关于发展国际接触的积极决定，但这完全不等于说今天没有成功的事情明天也一定做不成功。他指出，苏联政府将全力发展和支持苏联科学家、社会活动家和艺术界人士同其他国家代表的接触。我们的目的是希望这些接触无论对我国或对其他国家都有好处，并且促进各国之间的更好的互相了解、合作和友谊。
    莫洛托夫在谈到使奥地利中立的国家条约时指出，现在在欧洲除瑞士外，又有一个中立国家，这对各国人民都是重要的。我们反对在世界各地，特别是在欧洲建立军事集团，因为正是在欧洲，由于建立了各种军事集团，而爆发了第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战。莫洛托夫表示相信，奥地利所采取的符合奥地利人民的利益和情绪的中立政策将一贯诚实地执行下去。莫洛托夫说，在这种基础上，我们是你们在政治、经济和文化各方面的朋友。
    米高扬同意莫洛托夫的意见。他还着重说，奥苏两国的关系上没有悬而未决的问题，苏联政府将庄严地履行现有的条约和协定规定的一切义务。我们在这方面的出发点是，奥地利方面也将遵守所签订的条约。米高扬指出，必须消除互相关系中的不信任和偏见的残余。为此必须有更多的接触和真实的报道。而奥地利议会代表团的访问苏联将会在不小的程度上促进这一点。
    伏罗希洛夫同奥地利议员们告别时请求他们转达苏联最高苏维埃主席团对奥地利议会、联邦总统柯尔纳先生和联邦总理拉布先生的衷心问候。
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　以奥地利共和国联邦院主席弗里希为首的奥地利议会代表团，应苏联最高苏维埃的邀请在苏联进行了约两个星期的访问后，已经在四日离莫斯科回国。
    在离开苏联前，弗里希向报界发表声明，对苏联当局和居民的殷勤招待表示感谢。声明说，苏联人民实现和平恢复工作的规模和毅力给代表团留下了深刻的印象，这种和平恢复工作证明，苏联人民像其他国家人民一样，希望和平，并且为和平而努力。奥地利议会代表团认为，它所进行的访问是对发展两国人民之间的友好关系事业的重大贡献。
