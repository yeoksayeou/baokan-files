    Organize Urban Manure Supply to Farmers
    Encouraged by the high tide of agricultural cooperation, farmers are actively preparing to expand production next year, and the number of people buying manure from cities is increasing. Therefore, strengthening the management of urban manure and supplying it to farmers in a planned way is a task that the leading organs of various cities should pay attention to.
    Recently, the sales of manure in Fuzhou have been very good, and some farmers even go to the city to line up to buy it. Due to the manipulation of some private manure merchants, the price of manure continues to rise; some manure merchants also mix water and other debris in the manure, which reduces the quality of the manure. This situation has aroused dissatisfaction among farmers who buy manure. Recently, the Fuzhou Municipal Bureau of Commerce, together with relevant departments, organized a joint office for manure merchants to strengthen the management of manure merchants. The office has stipulated the price of manure in the city, and formulated measures for manure quality and unified allocation of manure. It has organized manure merchants to sign contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas near Fuzhou. From December, manure merchants began to sell manure to supply and marketing cooperatives, which in turn supplied it to farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives also helped manure merchants organize joint ventures or cooperative groups.
    The Fuzhou leadership's proactive approach to strengthening the management of urban manure and supporting rural production has been warmly welcomed by farmers in the suburbs of Fuzhou. The leading organs of other cities should also pay attention to solving this problem in a timely manner.

    组织城市粪肥供应农民
    农民在合作化高潮鼓舞下积极准备扩大明年的生产，向城市购买粪肥的人日益增多，因此，加强城市粪肥的管理，有计划地把粪肥供应给农民，是各个城市领导机关应当注意的一件工作。
    最近福州市的粪肥销路非常好，有些农民甚至进城排队买粪。由于有些私营粪商从中操纵，粪肥价格不断上涨；有些粪商还在粪里掺水和其他杂物，使粪肥的质量降低。这种情况引起了买粪农民的不满。最近，福州市商业局会同有关部门，组织粪商联合办事处，加强了对粪商的管理。办事处对全市粪价作了规定，并且定出粪肥质量、统一分配粪肥的办法，组织粪商分别同福州市附近农村的供销合作社签订合同。从十二月份起，粪商开始把粪肥批售给供销合作社，由供销合作社供应给农民。各供销合作社还帮助粪商组织合营或合作小组。
    福州市领导机关积极加强城市大粪的管理，支援农村生产的做法，受到了福州市郊区农民的热烈欢迎。其它城市的领导机关也应当及时注意解决这个问题。
