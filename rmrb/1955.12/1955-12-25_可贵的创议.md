    A Valuable Initiative

    Today and yesterday, this newspaper published several news items reporting that the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is striving to complete the total output value plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan in four years. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory and two other factories, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and six other state-owned and joint state-private factories, and the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory are all striving to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan in four years or a little over four years. This means that the Five-Year Plan is being striven for completion in four years or a little over four years. Many other enterprises in various regions are also brewing or have already prepared to complete the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is an inspiring signal! It shows the further rise of the working class's enthusiasm for building socialism, and shows the huge potential power hidden in enterprises to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The creative and enthusiastic actions of these enterprises embody the will and hope of the people of the whole country, and are what our country's rapidly developing socialist construction cause most urgently needs at present. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the speed of our country's socialist transformation of agriculture and socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has been greatly accelerated. Many provinces have already basically realized the semi-socialist cooperativization of agriculture this year. Some provinces have already proposed measures to basically realize complete socialist cooperativization ahead of schedule in 1959. Some cities have already made plans to basically realize the overall joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce next year.

    This new situation, on the one hand, requires industry to rapidly supply the countryside with a large amount of new means of production and consumer goods; on the other hand, it provides extremely favorable conditions for the accelerated development of industry in terms of capital, raw materials, and markets. In this situation, accelerating the speed of socialist industrialization has become an urgent task. And completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is an important step in achieving this task. All workers, technicians, and management personnel should dedicate all their wisdom and enthusiasm to strive for this goal!

    It is entirely possible to complete the industrial production and capital construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Although we will encounter some difficulties on the road ahead, as long as we strengthen leadership through comprehensive planning, take various concrete measures and promote advanced experiences, the difficulties can be overcome. The production practice of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory this year proves that the original plan was very conservative. They originally planned to reach the designed production capacity in 1957, but practice has proved that this period can be greatly shortened, thereby completing the tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule. According to the assessment of production capacity, the Shenyang Fan Factory found that there is still huge potential power in the enterprise. By giving play to these potential powers, it can complete the First Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau decided to speed up the construction and complete the railway bridge project of the bridge a year ahead of schedule in 1957. The calculations of these units show that the potential power in enterprises is multifaceted. Now we have fully favorable conditions to make these potential powers play out more widely than at any time in the past.

    In the past few years, we have accumulated some experience in industrial production and capital construction, and our technical level has also been improved to a certain extent; moreover, with the help of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, we can also master more new technologies faster. In particular, after the speed of socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce has been greatly accelerated, the enthusiasm of the working class across the country to build socialism has been unprecedentedly high. As long as we organize the enthusiasm of the masses, take active measures, promote advanced experience, new enterprises can reach the designed capacity ahead of schedule, old enterprises can further exert the effectiveness of existing equipment, capital construction projects can shorten the construction period and be completed ahead of schedule, and almost every enterprise unit has the possibility of completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Now the vast majority of departments believe that it is possible to speed up the pace of industrial development in our country under possible conditions. However, individual departments and individual enterprise leaders still do not have enough understanding of these potential powers, and some even do not pay attention to the increasingly high socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses. The Central South Geological Bureau is an example. This spring, the staff of the Siting Factory Exploration Team proposed that the team average drill 500 meters per drilling rig per month, and challenged the drilling workers across the country. However, the leaders of the Central South Geological Bureau believed that this was impossible, so they did not agree to their challenge. However, as a result, the drilling efficiency of this team reached 738 meters per month in November. Recently, when compiling the 1956 plan, the Ministry of Geology required the drilling efficiency of the Central South Geological Bureau to reach an average of 160 meters per month. The leaders of the Central South Geological Bureau believed that this requirement was quite high, and it was not easy to reach this target. However, many drilling teams under this bureau proposed that the drilling efficiency could be increased to 200 meters. Similar conservative thinking of the leaders of the Central South Geological Bureau also exists in many other units. This kind of conservative thinking suffocates the enthusiasm of the masses, shackles the initiative of the masses, and becomes a stumbling block on the road to accelerating socialist construction. At present, we must resolutely oppose and overcome this conservative thinking in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses and ensure the completion of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    All workers, managers, economic workers, scientific workers, engineers, and advanced workers, everyone should work together to explore all potential power, vigorously promote advanced experience, and formulate practical measures to make the 1956 plan more advanced and even more advanced, and strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule!

    可贵的创议
    社论
    今天和昨天本报发表了几条消息，报道鞍山钢铁公司争取四年完成第一个五年计划所规定的总产值计划，沈阳的风动工具厂等三个厂、上海的汽轮机厂等七个国营和公私合营工厂和重庆机床厂，都争取用四年的时间或者四年多的时间，完成第一个五年计划所规定的任务。这就是说，五年计划争取在四年或者四年多的时间内完成。其他各地也有许多企业正在酝酿或者已经准备提前完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。这是一个振奋人心的信号！它显示了工人阶级建设社会主义热情的进一步高涨，显示了企业中蕴藏着提前完成第一个五年计划的巨大潜在力。这些企业的充满创造性的热情的行动，体现了全国人民的意志和希望，正是我国目前社会主义建设事业飞速发展的形势所最迫切需要的。在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，我国对农业的社会主义改造和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，速度已大大加快。有不少省份已经在今年基本上实现了农业的半社会主义的合作化。有一些省份已经提出了在一九五九年提前基本上实现完全的社会主义合作化的措施。有些城市已经做出了在明年基本上实现对资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营的规划。
    这个新的形势一方面要求工业迅速地供应农村以大量的新的生产资料和消费资料；另一方面又在资金、原料、市场等方面给工业的加速发展提供了极其有利的条件。在这种情况下，加速社会主义工业化的速度就成了一个迫切的任务。而提前完成第一个五年计划，正是实现这一任务的重要步骤。全体工人、技术人员和管理人员应该献出全部的智慧和热情，为达到这个目标而奋斗！
    提前完成第一个五年计划的工业生产和基本建设任务，是完全可能的。在前进的道路上，虽然还会遇到一些困难，但只要我们通过全面规划，加强领导，切实采取各种具体措施和推广先进经验，困难是可以克服的。沈阳风动工具厂今年的生产实践证明了原订的计划很保守，他们原定一九五七年才能达到设计的生产能力，而实践证明这个期限可以大大缩短，从而可以提前一年多完成第一个五年计划所规定的任务。沈阳扇风机厂根据对生产能力的查定，发现企业里还有巨大的潜在力量，发挥这些潜在力量，可以提前一年多完成第一个五年计划。武汉长江大桥工程局决定加快建设速度，提前一年，在一九五七年完成大桥的铁路桥工程。这些单位的计算说明，企业中的潜在力是多方面的。现在我们具备了充分有利的条件，可以比过去任何一个时期更广泛地使这些潜在力发挥出来。
    几年来，我们在工业生产方面和基本建设方面，都已经积累了一些经验，技术水平也有了一定的提高；而且，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助下，我们还可以更快地掌握更多的新技术。特别是农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的速度大大加快之后，全国工人阶级建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨。只要我们把群众的积极性组织起来，采取积极的措施，推广先进经验，新建企业可以提前达到设计能力，旧企业可以进一步发挥现有设备的效能，基本建设工程可以缩短工期，提前完工，差不多每一个企业单位都有提前完成第一个五年计划的可能性。
    现在绝大多数部门认为在可能条件下可以使我国的工业发展速度加快一些。但是，也有个别部门和个别企业的领导工作人员，对于这些潜在力量还认识不足，甚至有的还不重视广大群众日益高涨的社会主义积极性。中南地质局就是一个例子。今年春天，泗汀厂勘探队的职工提出全队平均每月每台钻机钻进五百公尺，向全国钻探工人挑战。但中南地质局的领导工作人员认为这是不可能的，因而不同意他们挑战。可是，结果这个队的钻进效率，在十一月份就达到了月进七百三十八公尺。最近，在编制一九五六年计划的时候，地质部要求中南地质局的钻探效率平均达到每月一百六十公尺。中南地质局的领导工作人员认为这个要求相当高，达到这个指标很不容易。但是，这个局所属的许多钻探队却提出可以把钻进效率提高到二百公尺。类似中南地质局领导工作人员的这种保守思想，在其他许多单位也有。这种保守思想，窒息着群众的热情，束缚了群众的积极性，成为加速社会主义建设道路上的绊脚石。目前我们必须坚决反对和克服这种保守思想，才能充分发挥群众的积极性，保证提前完成第一个五年计划。
    全体工人、管理人员、经济工作人员、科学工作人员、工程师和先进工作人员，大家要一致努力，发掘一切潜在力，大力推广先进经验，拟订切实的措施，把一九五六年的计划订得先进些，更先进些，为提前完成第一个五年计划而奋斗！
