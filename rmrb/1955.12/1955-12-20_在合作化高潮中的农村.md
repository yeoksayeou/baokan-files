    Rural Areas in the Upsurge of Cooperativization
    Three Model Workers from One Family
    Recently, when our "Red Flag" Agricultural Production Cooperative (in Liaoning Province, Liaozhong County) held a meeting to elect model laborers, the Chen Zhaoan family produced three model workers.
    After the land reform, his family was allocated more than twenty mu of land; but without livestock, they had to exchange labor with households that had livestock, doing four or five days of work for others in exchange for one day's use of their livestock. His father, Chen Guanghai, often wondered: he had his own house and land, and worked hard day and night for several years, but how was he still so poor? Maybe it was his fate to be poor, and he would never be able to improve?
    When the agricultural cooperative was established in the village, they joined it. No matter how difficult the work, Chen Zhaoan would compete to do it, motivating others as well. Chen Guanghai was responsible for feeding the livestock for the cooperative. He often said: "I've lived for more than fifty years and never raised my own livestock, always feeding livestock for others, but this time I'm feeding my own!" He also worked very hard. They received more dividends than anyone else, paid off their old debts, and lived a good life. They valued the cooperative more than their own home.
    This year, our cooperative expanded to one hundred and seventy-three households. Chen Zhaoan became the production team leader. After the spring plowing, when model workers were selected, both he and his father were named first-class model laborers, and given big red flowers to wear. Chen Zhaoan's sister, Chen Guichun, was also encouraged by her father and brother, and worked very well during the summer weeding. In the fall, when the cooperative selected model laborers, their family really did have three model workers; Chen Guanghai saved a lot of feed and still fed the livestock very well, and was also named a special-class model worker. All the members of the cooperative wanted to learn from them, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher.

    A Little Girl Raises Three Hundred Chickens
    In the densely forested mountains of Kunlun County, Shandong Province, there is a small village of thirty-odd households called Qujia'an. After the village organized an agricultural production cooperative, they had the strength to develop diversified economic activities. One of their production plans was to raise chickens.
    The cooperative bought nearly three hundred chicks. Who would be responsible for raising them? A girl named Shao Maolan, who was a little over ten years old, bravely took on this task. She said: As long as it's good for the whole cooperative, as long as it's for socialism, anything is good!
    She was afraid that the newly bought chicks would catch a cold and get sick, so she carried the chicks in baskets to the yard to bask in the sun during the day, and even heated the kang for the chicks at night. Every day, she soaked the rice for feeding the chickens in clear water first, steamed it, and then fed it to the chicks. She also figured out the appropriate number of times and times to feed the chickens. Every day after the chickens left the nest, she swept the chicken coop clean; after the chickens entered the nest at night, she swept the yard clean. She found a book called "Talking About Chicken Raising" and asked the cooperative's accountant to read it to her. She heard that clam meat and small shrimp were good feed for chickens, so she ran to the small river three miles away every day after the chickens went to bed to catch clams and small shrimp. Hundreds of chickens were fed so that they were fat and strong.
    She raised hundreds of chickens so well that they were all familiar with her. With a gentle whistle, the chickens would fly, run, and pounce to her to gather. The cooperative members all happily gave her a thumbs up and praised her: Maolan is really a skilled chicken feeder!
                                  (Zhu Ruiqing)
    New Mountain Songs Replace Old Mountain Songs
    "Mountain folks, truly troubled; the stove as a cotton coat, pine torches as light, eating bitter herbs until old age." This is a mountain song that used to be popular in Luocun Township, Jiande County, Zhejiang Province.
    In the past, they went up the mountains every year to reclaim wasteland, but the soil they reclaimed would be washed away by rainwater after only a few years of cultivation. Year after year, the wasteland became less and less, and the cultivated land became smaller and smaller. Two farming families felt hopeless and had already moved to other counties.
    During the agricultural cooperativization movement, the government sent staff to help them make production plans, and set out plans for forestry and rotational cultivation. It is estimated that the total output value in 1956 could reach more than 220,000 yuan, and by 1967, it could increase to more than 520,000 yuan.
    The farmers saw that there were treasures in the mountains. However, without further developing the cooperatives, there was no strength to take the treasures. Batch after batch of people requested to establish cooperatives, and the five households living on the small hilltop also went to the township people's committee again and again to ask them to send people to help them establish cooperatives.
    The cooperative members and the farmers who were in the process of establishing cooperatives were busy on the hillsides in groups during the day, and busy in the villages at night - busy establishing cooperatives, and busy comprehensively developing their treasure mountain.
    The old mountain songs were no longer sung. The new mountain songs were sung: "It's good to run a cooperative, it's good to run a cooperative, put on a new cotton coat, there are hundreds of kinds of grass on the mountain, everything turns into treasure!"
                                  (Chen Shunhua)
    "Cooperatives are Osmanthus Candy"
    "My father and mother are both over sixty years old this year, and they are both very meticulous. Their whole lives have been spent 'sleeping with an abacus in their arms'.
      "Last fall, the people in our village organized an agricultural production cooperative. When I heard about the benefits of cooperativization, I signed up to join. Who knew that when my father and mother heard this news, they couldn't eat or sleep. They inquired here today and asked questions there tomorrow. Later, they learned about the cooperative's dividend distribution method. My mother got up in the middle of the night, lit a small vegetable oil lamp, went to the kitchen to boil a pot of hot water, and brought it to the bedside. My father rolled over and found an abacus, and the two of them sat by the bed and started calculating. They calculated over and over again, fearing that it wouldn't be worth it. But, they were afraid that if they didn't join the cooperative, others would look at them differently. My mother finally said: Let's go in and muddle through for a year or so, and if it's really bad, we'll each do our own thing.
      "After joining the cooperative, the two of them could do some light odd jobs in the cooperative, earning some work points; although I was young, others could help me do some proper work. When it came to the fall harvest distribution this year, we were given five thousand catties of grain, an increase of more than seventy yuan in income compared to previous years.
    "My father said: This account can be settled fairly! My mother also happily said: The Communist Party is our own mother, the cooperative is osmanthus candy, if someone smells this taste, they will want to try it even if they don't!"
      (Talk by Yan Youfu, a member of the Dongxiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taodian Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province, recorded by Shao Jiliang)
    "Younger by a Notch"
    "In the past, when we were worried about food and clothing, my old man and I often argued. If he was upset about something, or suffered from creditors outside, he would vent his anger on me and the children when he got home. At that time, I could also understand his hardships, knowing his worries, and I would try to be tolerant when he was angry; but, sometimes I couldn't help but retort a few words, and we would start arguing. But now? After joining the cooperative, everything is satisfactory, and we are happy all day long. Who wants to argue anymore? Who has the leisure to be upset? When we meet, we smile and talk, as if we are younger by a notch. In the past, we didn't have much to eat, and we were often tormented in our hearts for the children, and we couldn't take care of loving them. But now? The eldest child, Zhengshun, and the second daughter, Milan, are going to school, and we would feel bad if we didn't give them pretty clothes to wear! I said to the children: If it weren't for liberation, if it weren't for joining the cooperative, let alone wearing sneakers to school, you would probably have been carrying loads for others long ago! In the past, when my eldest daughter came to see us from her in-laws' house, she would always cry when she came, because she was worried that our life was too difficult and she couldn't be at ease. Now, she is happy every time she comes.
    "When the cooperative has a good harvest, our family's income increases. When it's cold, we wear cotton clothes, when it's hot, we wear single clothes, and when it's neither cold nor hot, we wear lined clothes and woolen clothes. We wear rubber shoes when it rains, and when we come back from work, there is ready-made hot water in the thermos. We don't want to go to sleep every night without listening to the radio broadcast from the cooperative. This is the life we ​​are living today. In the past, we didn't have enough to eat every year, but now we have surplus grain to sell. My old man and I sieved and winnowed the three hundred catties of surplus grain that we sold to the state several times. On the day of sending the grain, I personally watched the grain cart until it disappeared from sight before I went home.
    "How can we not work hard in the cooperative and make our cooperative even better?"
    (Talk by Chen Runzhen, a female member of Shuangwang Village, Weinan, Shaanxi, recorded by Junxiang)

    在合作化高潮中的农村
    一家出了三个模范
    我们“红旗”农业生产合作社（在辽宁省辽中县）第一社最近开会评选劳动模范的时候，陈兆安一家就出了三个模范。
    土地改革以后，他家分了二十多亩地；可是没有牲口，只好同有牲口户换工，爷儿俩给人家做四五天工，人家才给他们用一天牲口。他父亲陈广海常纳闷：自己有了房子、地，起早贪黑干了好几年，怎么还是紧巴巴的？也许咱是穷命，永不能好了？
    村里有了农业合作社，他们就加入了。不论怎么不好干的活，陈兆安都争着干，把别人也带动起来了。陈广海负责给社里喂牲口，他常说：“我活了五十多岁也没养活过自己的牲口，总是给别人喂牲口，这回喂的是自己的了！”也干得很起劲。他们分的红比谁家都多，把老债还清了，过上好日子了。他们把社看得比自己的家还重要。
    今年我们的社扩大到了一百七十三户。陈兆安当了生产队长。春耕结束后评选模范，他爷儿俩都被评为一等劳动模范，带上了大红花。陈兆安的妹妹陈桂春的劲头也被父亲和哥哥鼓起来了，在夏锄中间也干得很好。秋天社里评选劳动模范的时候，他们一家真的评上了三个模范；陈广海节约了大量的饲料还把牲口喂得很肥壮，还当上了特等模范。全体社员都要向他们学习，生产劲头都更高了。

    一个小姑娘养三百只鸡
    在山东省昆仑县丛林密布的半山腰里，有个曲家庵，是个三十几户人家的小村子。村子里组织了农业生产合作社以后，有力量发展多种经济了。他们有一项生产计划是养鸡。
    社里买来了将近三百只小鸡。谁负责喂养呢？一个十几岁的小姑娘邵茂兰勇敢地担当起来了这个任务。她说：只要对全社有好处，只要是为了社会主义，干什么都好！
    她怕刚买的小鸡受凉得病，白天一筐一筐地把小鸡搬到院子里晒太阳，晚上还给小鸡烧好暖炕。她每天都把喂鸡的米先放在清水里浸浸，捞出来蒸熟再给小鸡吃。她还研究出了喂鸡的合适的次数和时间。每天鸡离开窝以后，她就扫净鸡窝；晚上鸡进窝以后，她就扫净院子。她找到一本叫做“谈谈养鸡”的书，找社里的会计念给她听。她听说蛤肉、小虾是喂鸡的好饲料，每天等小鸡上窝以后，就跑到三里以外的小河边去捞蛤和小虾。几百只鸡都喂得又肥又壮。
    几百只鸡都让她养熟了。她轻轻一吹哨子，那些鸡就飞着跑着扑到她跟前集合。社员们都高兴地伸出大拇指夸奖她：茂兰真是个喂鸡的能手！
                                  （朱瑞卿）
    新山歌代替了老山歌
    “山里佬，真苦恼；火炉当棉袄，松明当灯照，苦菜吃到老。”这是浙江省建德县罗村乡过去流传的一支山歌。
    过去，他们年年上山开荒，开出来耕不了几年泥土就被雨水冲刷走了。一年年过去，荒山越垦越少，耕地越来越小。有两户农民觉得没指望，已经搬到外县去了。
    在农业合作化运动中，政府派工作人员帮他们做了生产规划，定出来了育林、轮垦的计划。估计一九五六年总产值可以达到二十二万多元，到一九六七年，能增加到五十二万多元。
    农民看到了山里有宝。可是，不进一步发展合作社，就没力量取宝。成批成批的人要求办社，住在小山头上的五户也一次又一次地到乡人民委员会要求派人帮助他们办社。
    社员和正在办社的农民，白天成群地在山岗上忙，晚上又在村子里忙——忙着办社，忙着全面开发他们的宝山。
    老山歌不再唱了。新山歌唱起来了：“办社好，办社好，穿上新棉袄，山上百样草，样样变成宝！”
                                  （陈顺华）
    “合作社是桂花糖”
    “我父亲母亲今年都有六十多岁了，都很精细，一生过日子总是‘抱着算盘睡觉’。
      “去年秋天，我们村里人组织农业生产合作社，我听说合作化的好处，就报名参加了。谁知道，我父亲母亲一听到这消息，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着，今天这里打听，明天那里问长问短。后来，他们知道了社里的分红办法，我母亲半夜起来点了个小菜油灯，到厨房烧了壶开水提到床前边，我父亲翻起身找了个算盘，两个人坐在床边算起账来了。算来算去，恐怕划不来。可是，又怕不入社旁人另眼看待。母亲最后说：进去混年把再说，真不好，再各人打各人的主意。
      “入了社，他俩在社里能做些轻杂活，进些工分；我虽然年纪轻，别人带着也能做些正活。到今年秋收分配的时候，分了五千斤谷子，比往年增加收入七十多元。
    “我父亲说：这个账可算清白了！我母亲也高兴地说：共产党，是亲娘，合作社是桂花糖，有人闻到这味道，不尝也要尝！”
      （湖北省黄冈县陶店乡东晓农业生产合作社社员严佑福的谈话，邵季良记）
    “年轻了一截子”
    “过去愁吃愁穿的时候，我同娃他爹常吵嘴。他啥事情不顺心，在外头受了债主的气，回了家就在我和娃儿跟前出气。那时候，我也能体谅他的苦处，知道他的心事，遇到他生气就尽量忍让；可是，有时忍不住了顶他几句，就吵起架来。现在呢？入了社，事事称心如意，一天都是高兴，谁还愿意吵嘴呢？谁还有那些闲心去闹别扭呢？见了面不笑不说话，好像年轻了一截子。过去没啥吃，经常为娃多心里熬煎，也顾不上疼爱他们。现在呢？大娃正顺、二女蜜兰上学了，不给穿个花衣服，还过意不去呢！我对娃说：不是解放，不是入社，别说穿球鞋上学，恐怕早就给人扛活去了！过去，我大女子从婆家来看我们，来一回总要哭一回，看我们日子太难过，放心不下。现在，她来一回高兴一回。
    “社里丰收了，我家的收入就增加了。冷了穿棉衣，热了穿单衣，不冷不热穿夹衣、绒衣，下雨穿胶鞋，做活回来热水瓶里有现成的热水，每天晚上不听听社里的收音机里的广播就不愿意睡觉。这就是我们今天过的日子。过去年年不够吃，现在有了余粮卖。我和娃他爹把卖给国家的三百斤余粮，细筛细簸了好几遍。送粮那天，我还亲自看着粮车走的看不见了才回家去。
    “我们怎么能不在社里好好干活，把我们的社办得更好呢？”
    （陕西渭南双王村女社员陈润真的谈话，俊祥记）
