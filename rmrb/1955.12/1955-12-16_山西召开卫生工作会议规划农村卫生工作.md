Shanxi Holds Health Work Conference to Plan Rural Health Work

The Shanxi Provincial Health Department held a provincial winter health work conference from November 25th to November 30th. The conference focused on discussing how to further organize medical and health forces to serve the agricultural collectivization movement.

The conference, based on the province's rural work plan, discussed and determined the province's rural health work plan.

The plan stipulates: During the first Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to consolidate and improve the health clinics, maternal and child health stations, and district health centers in each county throughout the province, and appropriately develop rural medical beds. Health clinics or joint clinics should be established in all one thousand new market towns throughout the province. Each township should basically have an acupuncture doctor or acupuncture personnel, and each township should establish a health station or joint clinic. Agricultural production cooperatives with more than fifty households should establish health rooms including health workers and midwives. Organize all rural medical and health forces to sign health contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and implement a regional responsibility system for rural health work. On the basis of completing the first Five-Year Plan for rural health work, gradually work towards having a rural hospital, an epidemic prevention station, and a maternal and child health station in each county; a health clinic in each new market town; a health station in each township and each advanced agricultural production cooperative; and a health room in each agricultural production cooperative. To form a rural health work network that is adapted to the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The plan stipulates that the occurrence of major endemic diseases will be eliminated within seven years. In order to prevent and reduce the occurrence of infectious diseases, the plan is to eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows within twelve years. By the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the number of babies delivered using the new method in the province will reach 75 percent of the province's infant birth rate, and by 1962 the new method of delivery will be universally adopted throughout the province.

The conference determined that before May 1956, more than 15,000 health workers will be trained throughout the province to assist 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives with more than 50 households to establish health rooms, and called on every acupuncture doctor in the countryside to take an apprentice. The conference demanded that the province's health clinics and health centers must focus on strengthening guidance for rural health work as their central task. In areas lacking medicine, they should lead the masses in running health services in a planned way, and organize Chinese and Western medicine doctors and demobilized and returned military health personnel to establish township joint clinics or health stations and health care institutions of agricultural production cooperatives through methods such as public-private joint ventures, mass fundraising, joint ventures by agricultural cooperatives, and joint ventures by doctors under the principle of voluntarism.
