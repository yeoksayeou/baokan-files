    Hunan Province has initially planned to completely eliminate schistosomiasis throughout the province in the next five years. To this end, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee established the Hunan Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Committee, with Tan Yubao, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, as the Director. The first meeting of this committee decided to completely eliminate schistosomiasis throughout the province from 1956 to 1960. The health department of Hunan Province is now actively making preparations, planning to organize approximately 4,000 experts, technical personnel, and administrative cadres to participate in this work, and to allocate 40 percent of the province's hospital beds to serve this effort. Specialized schistosomiasis hospitals will be established in various epidemic areas, and treatment teams will be organized to conduct mobile treatment in rural areas. In addition, the masses will be mobilized to eliminate the intermediate host of schistosomiasis—Oncomelania hupensis snails—and to strengthen the management of water sources and feces.
    Schistosomiasis in Hunan Province has been distributed in the Dongting Lake area and other parts of the province for hundreds of years, posing a great threat to the health of farmers. After liberation, the health department of Hunan Province began prevention and control work, successively establishing 35 prevention and control institutions in epidemic areas and curing more than 20,000 schistosomiasis patients. At the same time, taking advantage of the busy farming season, schistosomiasis prevention and control work was carried out in conjunction with production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南省初步计划五年内彻底消灭血吸虫病
    湖南省现在初步计划今后五年内在全省彻底消灭血吸虫病。为此，湖南省人民委员会成立了湖南省血吸虫病防治委员会，由中共湖南省委员会副书记谭余保任主任委员。这个委员会第一次会议决定，从一九五六年起到一九六零年，在全省范围内彻底消灭血吸虫病。湖南省卫生部门现在正积极进行筹备工作，计划组织专家、技术人员和行政干部四千人左右参加这一工作，并且抽调全省百分之四十的病床为这一工作服务。在各疫区将设立血吸虫病的专门医院，组织治疗小组深入农村巡回治疗。此外，还要发动群众消灭血吸虫的中间宿主——钉螺，并且加强水源、粪便等管理工作。
    湖南省的血吸虫病分布在洞庭湖区和其他部分地区已有几百年历史，对农民身体健康危害很大。解放后，湖南省卫生部门就着手进行防治工作，先后在疫区设立防治机构三十五处，治好血吸虫病患者二万多人。同时，利用农忙季节，结合生产进行了防治血吸虫病的工作。　（新华社）
