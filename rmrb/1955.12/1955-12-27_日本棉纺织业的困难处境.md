    The Difficult Situation of Japan's Cotton Textile Industry
    Shen Yuqiang
    Japan is one of the world's developed countries in the cotton textile industry. Japan's textile exports occupy an important position in its foreign trade. However, in recent years, with the decline of civilian industries and the recession of foreign trade, Japan's cotton textile industry has fallen into an increasingly serious crisis of production reduction and bankruptcy. This year's situation is even worse. By the end of August, Japan's inventory of cotton fabrics had reached 99.5 million square yards, and cotton yarn had reached 23.6 million pounds. The surge in inventory has forced prices to plummet. The price of 40-count yarn fell to its lowest level in ten years since the war in early June, and the prices of cotton fabrics in Tokyo and Osaka even fell below cost. Since May, the Japanese government has forced the textile industry to reduce production by 12 percent per month, and from August, this has been increased to 16 percent per month. This order will continue until March next year. Currently, the Japanese cotton textile industry is preparing to cut production equipment by 15 percent, that is, to reduce the equipment of 1.2 million spindles from Japan's existing 8 million spindles.
    The difficult situation of the Japanese cotton textile industry is the inevitable result of the United States' control of Japan's economy and foreign trade, making it serve American interests.
    Since the end of the war, especially during the American war of aggression in Korea, the United States has forced Japan to militarize its industry to meet the needs of American aggression in Asia, resulting in the one-sided development of Japanese industry and the destruction of peaceful industries. During the Korean War, the metal industry related to arms production had reached 179 percent of its pre-war level, while the output of the textile industry was only 70 percent of its pre-war level.
    The slow recovery of the Japanese cotton textile industry is inseparable from the so-called "embargo" policy imposed on it by the United States. Japan's cotton textiles mainly rely on exports, while raw cotton needs to be imported from abroad. After the United States implemented the "embargo" policy, it controlled Japan's entire foreign trade. The United States monopolized the raw material import of Japan's textile industry, and every year it forced Japan to import millions of bales of expensive surplus American cotton. Robertson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs of the US government, openly stated: "Japan is one of our best customers, especially for agricultural products such as cotton, soybeans, barley, and rice." Not long ago, in the second US-Japan surplus agricultural product agreement temporarily signed between the United States and Japan, it was stipulated that Japan would accept 100,000 bales of American surplus cotton, and the United States also required Japan to buy another 670,000 bales of American cotton. According to calculations by the Japanese textile industry, the price of American cotton is 30 percent higher than that of Mexican cotton; if cotton is imported from Asian countries, a lot of freight can also be saved. The high cost of raw materials naturally increases the cost of products, which seriously weakens the competitiveness of Japanese textiles in the international market.
    Japan's cotton textiles are now mainly exported to countries in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is the traditional market of the United Kingdom, and both the United Kingdom and Japan are countries that export large quantities of textiles. Japan's cotton textile industry's expansion into the Southeast Asian market is bound to be strongly resisted by the British textile industry. After the British and Japanese governments signed a trade payment agreement last January, Broadman, a cotton textile merchant from Lancashire, England, panicked and pointed out that Japanese cotton textiles could reduce British exports to colonies by 20 to 30 percent, "which would be terrible for Lancashire." This year's British-Japanese trade negotiations began in June, and the two sides argued for more than four months before signing an agreement in October that only lasted for half a year, and the British Trade Minister was even accused of being "the hangman of Lancashire." The United Kingdom constantly uses various methods in the sterling area to exclude and restrict the sales of Japanese textiles. Even recently, the United States has forcibly dragged Japan into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the United Kingdom is still unwilling to remove tariff barriers to Japan. At the same time, some countries in Southeast Asia, such as India, have developed their own textile industries after the war. India not only does not need to import textiles, but it has become a country exporting textiles in the Asian market. Obviously, the difficulty of Japan's cotton textile exports to the Southeast Asian market will continue to increase.
    The Japanese cotton textile industry has also tried to enter the US market, hoping to sell a portion of Japanese cotton textiles made from American cotton in the US market. This attempt by Japan has been severely resisted by American monopoly capital. The United States not only raised tariffs to restrict the import of Japanese cotton textiles, but also used political pressure to prohibit the sale of Japanese textiles in the United States. Under pressure from the United States, the Japanese government banned the export of four types of cotton fabrics, including unbleached cloth and bleached cloth, to the United States on November 8 this year. These four types of cotton fabrics are considered to be the most competitive with similar products in the United States. On November 22, the Japanese government was forced to announce that all kinds of Japanese cotton fabrics would be temporarily suspended from export to the United States.
    In the case of hitting walls everywhere in overseas markets, the domestic market for Japanese textiles is also shrinking. The Japanese people are under the colonial-style exploitation of the United States; moreover, due to the US forcing Japan to rearm, the heavy burden of huge military expenditures falls on the Japanese people, their lives are very poor, and they have to try to reduce the cost of buying clothes. According to statistics, in 1953, the per capita consumption of cotton fabrics in Japan only reached five-eighths of the pre-war level.
    The difficult situation of Japan's cotton textile industry is a vivid example of Japan's economic being cruelly enslaved by the United States.
    The textile industry occupies an important position in the entire national economy of Japan. The textile industry falling into crisis is bound to seriously affect the entire Japanese economy. Moreover, the monopoly capitalists of the Japanese cotton textile industry use various means to transfer the losses caused by the crisis to small and medium-sized textile companies, workers, and consumers, which has led to the bankruptcy of many small and medium-sized textile industries in Japan and a large number of workers becoming unemployed.
    The Japanese government's forced reduction of cotton textile industrial production, and the Japanese Textile Association's plan to reduce the production capacity of the cotton textile industry, will not only fail to solve the current crisis of the Japanese cotton textile industry, but will also deepen this crisis and make more workers unemployed. To overcome the crisis in the cotton textile industry, it is first necessary to get rid of the US embargo policy and control, because only by abolishing the restrictions of the "embargo" and on the basis of free trade, is it possible for the Japanese cotton textile industry to develop.

    日本棉纺织业的困难处境
    沈毓强
    日本是世界上棉纺织工业发达的国家之一。日本纺织品的出口，在它的对外贸易中占有重要的地位。但是，近几年来，随着民用工业的凋敝和对外贸易的衰退，日本棉纺织业陷入了日益加剧的减产和倒闭的危机。今年的情况更加恶化。到八月底止，日本库存棉织品已达九千九百五十万平方码，棉纱达到二千三百六十万磅。存货激增迫使价格暴跌，四十支纱的棉布在六月初曾跌落为战后十年来的最低价格，东京和大阪棉布的价格甚至跌落到成本以下。从五月起，日本政府强令纺织业每月减产百分之十二，从八月起更增加为每月减产百分之十六，这项命令一直要继续到明年三月。现在，日本棉纺织业界正在准备削减生产设备百分之十五，即从日本现有的八百万纱锭中，减少一百二十万纱锭的设备。
    日本棉纺织工业陷于这样困难的境地，是美国控制日本的经济和对外贸易使之为美国利益服务的必然结果。
    战后以来，特别是美国侵略朝鲜战争期间，美国强迫日本工业军事化，以适应美国在亚洲进行侵略的需要，结果使日本的工业片面发展，和平工业受到摧残。在朝鲜战争期间，与军火生产有关的金属工业已达到战前的百分之一百七十九，而纺织工业的产量仅为战前水平的百分之七十。
    日本棉纺织工业恢复得缓慢，和美国强迫它执行所谓“禁运”政策是分不开的。日本棉纺织品主要依靠输出，而原棉需要从国外输入。美国实行“禁运”政策后，控制了日本整个对外贸易。美国垄断了日本纺织工业的原料输入，每年都要强迫日本输入上百万包价格昂贵的剩余美棉。美国政府负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊就公开说过：“日本是我们最好的主顾之一，对棉花、大豆、大麦和大米等农产品来说，更是如此。”不久前，美日两国临时签订的第二次美日剩余农产品协定中，规定日本接受十万包美国剩余棉花，美国并且要日本必须再买六十七万包美国棉花。据日本纺织业界计算，美国棉花的价格要比墨西哥棉花贵百分之三十；如果从亚洲国家输入棉花，还可以节省大量运费。原料的昂贵自然增加了产品的成本，这就严重减弱了日本纺织品在国际市场的竞争能力。
    日本棉纺织品现在主要是向东南亚地区各国输出。东南亚是英国的传统市场，而英国和日本同样是输出大宗纺织品的国家。日本棉纺织业向东南亚扩张市场，自必遭到了英国纺织业的强烈抵制。去年一月英日两国政府签订了贸易支付协定后，英国兰开夏的棉纺织业商人布劳德曼惊慌地指出，日本的棉纺织品可使英国对殖民地的输出减少百分之二十到三十，“这对兰开夏来说，将是很可怕的事情。”今年的英日贸易谈判，从六月间开始双方争执了四个多月，才在十月间签订了一个为期只有半年的协定，而英国贸易大臣还被指责为“兰开夏的绞刑吏”。英国在英镑区不断用各种方式排斥和限制日本纺织品的销售。甚至最近美国已经硬把日本拉进了国际关税及贸易总协定，而英国依然不愿向日本撤除关税壁垒。同时，东南亚有些国家如印度等国，在战后已发展了本国的纺织工业。印度不仅可以不必输入纺织品，而它本身就成了亚洲市场输出纺织品的国家。很显然，日本棉纺织品向东南亚市场的输出的困难还会继续增加。
    日本棉纺织业也曾设法进入美国市场，希望能够在美国市场上销售一部分用美国棉花制成的日本棉纺织品。日本的这种尝试，遭到了美国垄断资本的严厉抵制。美国不仅提高关税限制日本棉纺织品进口，而且使用政治压力禁止日本纺织品在美国销售。日本政府在美国的压力下，在今年十一月八日就禁止了日本出产的本色布、漂白布等四种棉织品输往美国。这四种棉织品被认为和美国同类产品竞争最为剧烈。十一月二十二日日本政府更被迫宣布，各种日本棉织品一律暂时停止输往美国。
    在海外市场到处碰壁的情况下，日本纺织品的国内市场又陷在萎缩中。日本人民在美国的殖民地式的剥削下；而且由于美国强迫日本重新武装，巨额军费的重担落在日本人民身上，生活十分贫苦，不得不尽量节减添置衣装的费用。据统计，一九五三年日本每个人的棉织品消费量仅仅达到战前的八分之五。
    日本棉纺织业的困难处境，是日本在经济方面遭受美国的残酷奴役的活生生的实例。
    日本纺织工业在整个国民经济中占着重要地位。纺织业陷于危机，自必严重地影响日本的整个经济。而且，日本棉纺织业的垄断资本家用种种手段把危机所造成的损失转嫁给中小纺织公司、工人和消费者，这就使得日本许多中小纺织业倒闭，大量工人失业。
    日本政府强制减缩棉纺织工业的生产，日本纺织协会计划削减棉纺织工业生产能力，不仅不能解救目前日本棉纺织业的危机，而且只会加深这个危机，使更多的工人陷于失业。要克服棉纺织业的危机，首先必须摆脱美国的禁运政策和控制，因为只有撤销“禁运”的限制，在自由贸易的基础上，才有可能使日本的棉纺织业得到发展。
