Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: A total of 3,298 towns and cities nationwide have successively implemented a system of rationed grain supply. These towns and cities include large and medium-sized cities, county towns in various provinces, and some larger market towns. Provinces such as Shandong, Shanxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have fully implemented the rationed supply system in the towns and cities where it was planned.

After the implementation of the grain rationing system in these towns and cities, statistics from 238 of the larger towns and cities nationwide show that grain sales in September this year decreased by 10% compared to the same period last year, and in October decreased by 19% compared to the same period last year. After the implementation of the rationing system in Shanghai, Xi'an, Jinan, Fuzhou, Baoding, and Nanjing, grain sales in the current year can be reduced by more than 500 million jin compared to the previous year. The Ministry of Food estimates that if grain sales in towns and cities nationwide are reduced by an average of about 7% compared to the previous year, nationwide grain sales for the whole year can be reduced by 2 to 3 billion jin.

Numerous materials from various localities prove that the implementation of the grain rationing system can not only save grain but also further guarantee the reasonable supply of grain. The various supply standards stipulated by the state are sufficient and meet actual needs. After the implementation of the rationing system in Shanghai, households with surplus grain account for about 11%, while households with insufficient grain account for only 4.64%. According to a typical survey of 744 households in Jinan City, Shandong Province, 96.6% of households have enough grain to eat according to the rationed supply standards. Local governments have already taken or are taking appropriate measures to organize residents to adjust surpluses and deficits or to provide appropriate care for residents who feel slightly insufficient.

During this period, the work of saving grain is increasingly penetrating into residents' homes. "Save grain, arrange household affairs reasonably, and support national construction" has become the action slogan of the broad masses of housewives. After rationing, many residents have improved cooking methods, reduced spillage, and formulated plans for saving grain.

### 全国三千多个市镇实行粮食定量供应

    全国三千多个市镇实行粮食定量供应
    据新华社二日讯　全国已经有三千二百九十八个市镇先后实行了粮食定量供应制度。这些市镇包括大、中城市，各省县城和一些较大的集市。山东、山西、福建、江苏、安徽、陕西、辽宁、黑龙江、热河等省内计划实行定量供应的市镇，已经全部实行了定量供应制度。
    在这些市镇实行粮食定量供应制度以后，据全国二百三十八个比较大的市镇的统计，今年九月份粮食销售量比去年同期减少了百分之十，十月份比去年同期减少了百分之十九。上海、西安、济南、福州、保定、南京六个城市实行定量供应制度以后，本年度粮食销售量可以比上一年度减少五亿多斤。据粮食部预计，如果全国市镇的粮食销售量比上年度平均减少百分之七左右，全年全国粮食销售量就可以减少二十或三十亿斤。
    各地都有很多材料证明，实行粮食定量供应制度，不但可以节约粮食，而且能进一步保证粮食的合理供应。国家规定的各种供应标准，是够吃够用、符合实际需要的。上海市实行定量供应制度后，粮食有余的户数约占百分之十一，而粮食不足的户数仅占百分之四点六四。据山东济南市七百四十四户居民的典型调查，按照定量供应标准，粮食够吃的户数占百分之九十六点六。各地政府已经或正在采取适当的办法，组织居民调剂余缺，或对于稍感不足的居民加以适当照顾。
    在这个时期，节约粮食的工作日益深入到居民的家庭。“节约粮食，合理安排家务，支援国家建设”，成为广大家庭主妇的行动口号。许多居民在定量供应以后，改进做饭方法，减少抛撒，订出了节约用粮的计划。
