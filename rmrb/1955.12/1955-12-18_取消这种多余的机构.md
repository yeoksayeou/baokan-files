    Abolish This Redundant Organization

    To the Editor:
    In Chongqing, there is an organization called "Sichuan Province Chuandong, Chuannan Cinema Chongqing Office." This "office" shares office space with the Sichuan Provincial Company of China Film Distribution Corporation, has two staff members, and has purchased bicycles, printed envelopes and letterhead, and engraved seals. All these expenses are shared by the local cinemas. Its task is to collect the films distributed by the film company to the local cinemas and then distribute them. It is obviously unnecessary to set up a special agency for such a task. Can't the Sichuan Provincial Company of China Film Distribution Corporation distribute the films directly? Why is it necessary to go through an extra step?
    It is said that such institutions also exist in other regions, because they were established according to the opinions of the China Film Distribution Corporation. I think this company should quickly study and abolish this redundant organization.

                                      Lei Zhenyi

### 取消这种多余的机构

    取消这种多余的机构编辑同志：
    在重庆市有一个名叫“四川省川东、川南影院驻渝办事处”的机构。这个“办事处”的办公地点同中国电影发行公司四川省公司在一起，有两名工作人员，还购置了自行车，印制了信封、信笺，刻了图章，所有这些用费都由各地电影院分担。它的任务是：把电影公司发给各地电影院的影片领出来，然后再发出去。为这样一件工作设立一个专门机构显然是不必要的。难道中国电影发行公司四川省公司不能把影片直接发出去吗？为什么非要多转一道手不可呢？
    据说，这样的机构在其他地区也有，因为这是根据中国电影发行总公司的意见设立的。我认为，这个公司应该迅速研究，取消这种多余的机构。
