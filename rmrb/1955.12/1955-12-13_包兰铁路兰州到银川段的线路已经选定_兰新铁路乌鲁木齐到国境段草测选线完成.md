Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 12th: The line selection work for the Lanzhou to Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has been completed. Surveying of this section began in 1953, and a route was initially selected from several alternatives in 1954. After repeated comparisons and studies, the line has now been finalized. The newly selected route has more rational bridge site selections and station distribution than the 1954 route, and it also shortens the line by more than ten kilometers and reduces the number of stations by four, which can save the state a large amount of engineering investment. The section from Lanzhou to Yinchuan is a total of 478 kilometers long, and the railway line will pass through the Yellow River and the Tengger Desert, making the project very arduous. The railway line will also pass through the Yinchuan Plain and areas with abundant mineral resources, so it is of great significance to build this railway as soon as possible. Construction has already begun on the section from Lanzhou to Dijiatai. Construction of the 114-kilometer section from Dijiatai to Baiyangzi will also begin in advance next year based on the selected route.

This newspaper, Urumqi, December 12th: The preliminary survey line selection work for the Urumqi to border section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been completed. Personnel from the Urumqi-Alashankou section surveying and design team spent two months conducting field measurements and reconnaissance in the Ili and Tacheng Special Zones and the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. Now, four principle-based schemes have been selected for this section of railway line. All schemes originate from Urumqi City, follow the Urumqi-Ili Highway to Usu, and then branch off from there to the border.

While carrying out the line selection work, the surveying and design team also conducted water quality surveys in some areas, soil tests and range measurements in saline-alkali, desert, and swamp areas. They found that the water source in this area is sufficient, and the water contains few minerals, making it suitable for locomotive, construction, and domestic use.

    包兰铁路兰州到银川段的线路已经选定
    兰新铁路乌鲁木齐到国境段草测选线完成
    新华社兰州十二日电　包兰铁路兰州到银川段的选线工作已经完成。这段铁路从一九五三年开始勘测，到一九五四年曾经从几条比较线中选出一条线路，后来又经过反复的比较研究，现在才把线路选定了。新选定的这条线路，桥位选择和车站分布比一九五四年选的线路更加合理，并且缩短了十多公里长的线路，减少了四个车站，因此，可以为国家节省大量的工程投资。从兰州到银川一段共长四百七十八公里，铁路线要经过黄河和腾格里大沙漠，工程十分艰巨。铁路线还要穿过银川平原和有着丰富矿产资源的地带，因此，及早修通这条铁路有很重要的意义。现在，从兰州到狄家台一段已经动工修筑。狄家台到白?子一百十四公里的一段，明年也要根据选定的线路提前施工。
    本报乌鲁木齐十二日电　兰新铁路乌鲁木齐到国境段草测选线工作已经完成。担任这一工作的乌鲁木齐—阿拉山口段勘测设计队的人员，以两个月的时间，在伊犁、塔城专区和博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州境内，进行了实地测量和踏勘。现在，这一段铁路线已选出了四个原则性的方案。各方案的线路都由乌鲁木齐市起，沿着乌鲁木齐—伊犁公路到乌苏，从这里分线直到国境。
    勘测设计队在选线工作的同时，还在部分地区进行了水质勘测，盐碱、沙漠、沼泽地带的土壤化验和范围测量，发现这一带水源充足，水里含矿物质较少，适用于机车、施工、生活用水。
