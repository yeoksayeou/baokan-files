Title: Why Do Accidents Keep Happening?

    From the first quarter of this year to the present, various accidents have been continuously occurring in the large rolling mill workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant, and the nature of the accidents is becoming more and more serious.
    What is the reason for this? To find the reason, we must understand the "process" before and after each accident in this workshop in the past. What is thought-provoking is that this "process" is almost an exact "old routine". After an accident occurs, everyone argues endlessly. The leaders blame the equipment personnel for not doing a good job in maintaining the machinery, the equipment personnel blame the workers for not following operating procedures, and the workers blame the machines for being too old. Once the machine is repaired, the arguing stops. Because the accident takes up production time, a month's work has to be completed in half a month, so inspections and repairs are simplified, and in the end, the machine suffers. An accident happens again, and the arguing comes along with it. This cycle repeats itself, and the number of accidents always increases, and the content of people's arguments remains unchanged. This situation has continued until now, so some people say: "Machine production is too complicated, and it is not easy to find the cause of an accident." Is it really impossible to find the cause? Or should the blame all be attributed to the machinery and equipment? Of course not. The biggest accident in this workshop was the breaking of the archway. Before the accident, the Soviet experts who came to the factory had pointed out that the archway's load-bearing capacity was insufficient, but the workshop leaders did not take preventive measures based on this opinion. After the accident occurred, everyone said: "The Soviet experts said long ago that the archway's load-bearing capacity was insufficient." It can be seen that this does not mean that the archway should be held responsible for the accident.
    It is precisely because this workshop did not thoroughly investigate the cause and affix responsibility after an accident occurred, that the accidents increased from few to many, and from minor to serious. This is the crux of the problem.

    为什么老出事故
    从今年第一季度到现在，重庆第一钢铁厂大型轧钢车间不断发生各种事故，而且事故的性质一天比一天严重。
    这是什么原因呢？要找原因，就必须了解这个车间过去每次事故发生前后的经过。耐人寻味的是这种“经过”几乎是不折不扣的“老一套”。事故发生之后，大家争吵不休，领导上怪设备人员没有做好机器的维护工作，设备人员怪工人不遵守操作规程，工人怪机器太老太旧。等到机器一修好，争吵也停止了。由于事故占去了生产时间，一个月的活不得不在半个月内完成，于是检查、修理，一切从简，最后机器倒楣。事故又发生了，争吵也伴随而来。如此周而复始，循环不已，事故总是有增无减，人们争吵的内容也毫无改变。这种局面持续到现在，于是有人就说：“机器生产太复杂，发生了事故根本不容易找到原因。”真的找不到原因吗？或者应当把罪过统统归咎于机器设备吗？当然不是。这个车间最大的一次事故是打断牌坊。在事故发生之前，到厂的苏联专家曾经指出：牌坊的负荷能力不够，但是车间领导没有根据这个意见采取预防措施，等到事故发生之后，大家才说：“苏联专家早说过，牌坊负荷能力不够。”可见这并不能说明事故的责任应该由牌坊来负。
    正因为这个车间在发生事故以后，没有彻底弄清原因查究责任，才使事故由少变多，由轻而重，这就是问题的症结。
