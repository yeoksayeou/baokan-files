Since the beginning of October, the Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province has established 958 new agricultural production cooperatives. Together with the original 844 cooperatives, the number of farmer households joining the cooperatives has reached 72.76% of the total number of farmer households. The entire special district has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization.

After Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Chinese Communist Party's Seventh Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) resolution on the question of agricultural cooperativization were widely disseminated in the Yinchuan Special District, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants throughout the special district for taking the socialist road soared to unprecedented heights. In late September, the Yinchuan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee, studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. Subsequently, a massive propaganda campaign on agricultural cooperativization was launched throughout the special district. Activists from the old cooperatives also formed propaganda teams, using facts such as increased production in various cooperatives to specifically illustrate the superiority of agricultural cooperativization. In addition, since the spring, Party committees at all levels had carried out preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, such as training cadres, and the movement to develop agricultural cooperatives throughout the special district rapidly unfolded.

On November 17, the Yinchuan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee, summarized the experience of developing agricultural cooperatives in the previous period, and decided to shift the focus of work to rectifying and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

    银川专区基本上实现合作化
    十月初以来，甘肃省银川专区新建立了九百五十八个农业生产合作社，连同原有的八百四十四个社，入社农户已经达到总农户的百分之七十二点七六。全专区已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议在银川专区广泛传达以后，全专区广大农民走社会主义道路的积极性空前高涨。九月下旬，中共银川地委召开地委扩大会议，学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，批判了右倾保守思想。接着，全专区展开了声势浩大的关于农业合作化的宣传活动。各地老社的积极分子也组成宣传队，用各社增产等事实具体说明了农业合作化的优越性。加以春季以来各级党委进行了训练干部等建社准备工作，全专区发展农业合作社的运动便迅速开展起来。
    十一月十七日，中共银川地委召开了地委扩大会议，总结了前一个时期发展农业合作社的经验，决定将工作重心转向整顿和巩固农业合作社。
