Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 4th. According to TASS Rangoon: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, flew from Rangoon to Shan State on the morning of the 3rd. Shan State is located in the northeast of the Union of Burma. It is a scenic area 1,000 meters above sea level, known for its beautiful Inle Lake.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd. TASS Moscow, December 2nd: "Pravda" reporters Zhukov and Orestov reported in detail from Rangoon on the grand occasion of the Burmese people welcoming Bulganin and Khrushchev and their entourage.

They pointed out that the people of Rangoon eagerly awaited the arrival of the Soviet guests. They decorated their city with affectionate feelings, set up arches with welcome slogans written on them, and posted slogans in Burmese and Russian. Bulganin and Khrushchev arrived in Rangoon just in time for the grand Light Festival, when Rangoon is in a carnival atmosphere, resplendent with lights.

Due to the arrival of the Soviet guests, this year's lights were particularly rich and colorful. Various colors of light shone on the tops and spires of the ancient pagodas. Rows of colored light bulbs and lanterns were installed on the streets, in front of government office buildings, and in the dense green foliage of tropical trees.

On the eve of the arrival of the guests, the film "U Nu in the Soviet Union" was screened in a cinema. Traditional folk festivals took place throughout the city all night long. At dawn, hundreds of thousands of citizens poured onto the road leading to the Mingaladon Airport, where Khrushchev and Bulganin were scheduled to land.

The reporters wrote: Many people organized themselves and lined up to welcome the guests. One could see a large red flag with a white five-pointed star and a hammer and sickle, the flag of the Trade Union Congress (Burma). There was also the green flag of the All-Burma Youth League. Then came a wave of small flags with Picasso's world-famous dove of peace - these were the personnel of the Burmese peace organizations who came to welcome the guests from the Soviet Union. At the forefront was the famous public figure and Stalin International Peace Prize laureate, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing.

In Burma, as in India, people welcomed the guests from Moscow with heartfelt joy, treating them as brothers.

An official from the Propaganda Department told "Pravda" reporters that no foreign statesman had received such a warm and widespread welcome in Burma.

Zhukov and Orestov wrote: There is no doubt that Khrushchev and Bulganin's visit to Burma will help strengthen the friendship between the Burmese and Soviet people, promote trust between them, and promote closer cooperation in the struggle for peace in Asia and the rest of the world.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫前往掸邦访问
    “真理报”记者报道缅甸人民热烈欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社仰光讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在三日上午乘飞机从仰光前往掸邦。掸邦位于缅甸联邦东北部。一个拔海一千公尺的风景地区，有着秀丽著称的英莱湖。
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：“真理报”记者茹科夫和奥列斯托夫从仰光详细地报道了缅甸人民欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫以及他们的随行人员的盛况。
    他们指出，仰光人民热切地盼望苏联贵宾们的到来。他们怀着亲切的感情装饰了他们的城市，扎起了写着欢迎口号的牌楼，张贴了缅文和俄文的标语。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到达仰光的时候恰好是举行盛大的灯节的日子，每当这个节日，灯光辉煌的仰光是在一片狂欢声中。
    由于苏联贵宾的到来，今年的灯光特别丰富多采。在古老的宝塔的塔顶和塔尖上闪烁着各种颜色的光芒。在街道上，在政府办公大楼的前面，在热带树木的密密绿叶里，都安装了一排排的各色灯泡和灯笼。
    在贵宾们到达的前夕，一家电影院上映了影片“吴努在苏联”。传统的人民节日在市内各处整整进行了通宵。天亮的时候，成千上万的市民涌到通往赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁将要着陆的孟加拉洞机场的公路上。
    记者写道：许多人组织起来，排着队来欢迎贵宾。人们可以看到一面大红旗，上面有一颗白色五角星和镰刀、锤子，这是工会大会（缅甸）的旗帜。此外还有全缅青年联盟的绿色旗帜。接着是一片小旗帜涌来，上面有世界闻名的毕加索和平鸽——这是缅甸和平组织的人员来欢迎苏联来的贵宾。在最前面的是著名公众人物、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者德钦哥都迈。
    在缅甸，像在印度一样，人们怀着衷心欢乐的情绪来欢迎来自莫斯科的贵宾，把他们当作兄弟看待。
    宣传部的一位官员对“真理报”记者说，没有任何外国政治家在缅甸受到这样热烈的广泛的欢迎。
    茹科夫和奥列斯托夫写道：毫无疑问，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁对缅甸的访问，将有助于加强缅甸人民和苏联人民的友谊，促进他们之间的信任以及在争取亚洲和世界其余地区和平的斗争中的更加密切的合作。
