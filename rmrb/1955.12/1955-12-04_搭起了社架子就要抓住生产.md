Once the Cooperative Framework is Set Up, Production Must Be Grasped
Wu Yaodong, Secretary of the CPC Lishui County Committee, Zhejiang Province

Recently, I and several comrades went to the countryside and visited several newly established cooperatives and newly expanded old cooperatives. We saw that a large number of new members have been invested in collective production, and the new members are very interested in collective labor and are working very hard. In Fengming Cooperative in Fengjie Township, twenty-odd members built a large ash storage and repaired a cattle shed in one afternoon on the first day of collective production. On the second and third days, twenty to thirty members worked together to carry pond mud. The cooperative also bought a double-wheeled double-铧 plow and a large number of fertilizer powder, preparing for winter planting. However, there is a common problem in the new cooperatives, that is, the production management is more chaotic. This problem is hindering the current comprehensive production planning and organization of the production upsurge and needs to be properly resolved immediately.

Most of the new members of these new cooperatives and expanded old cooperatives have transferred from mutual aid teams; some have transferred as a whole group, and some have transferred a part. The original mutual aid teams no longer exist or have been dismantled, and have been elevated to agricultural production cooperatives with land-based shares and unified management as the main feature. In the initial stage of this organizational form transformation, it is necessary to have a more sound production organization than before, implement a reasonable division of labor, and also have a certain degree of production planning in order to do a good job in production. It is not difficult to do this, but most of the new cooperatives in Lishui County are still prototype cooperatives (ie, framework cooperatives). Many economic problems within the cooperatives have not yet been resolved, and the leadership structure of the cooperatives has not yet been formally established. All of this work still requires a period of rectification before it can get on the right track. It is difficult to organize production under these circumstances.

First, the problems in production management are more complex, mainly due to the dual contradictions of public and private, first and later in production. The new members harvest their own and plant collectively. Should we harvest or plant first? Harvest yours or harvest mine first? These issues often become the focus of major disputes in arranging production, and all these contradictions bring a certain degree of difficulty to the production management within the cooperative. Some preparatory committee members of Zhao Yuan Cooperative in Fengjie Township believe that the members should be allowed to finish their own work first, and then go to the cooperative to work. Therefore, after the establishment of some new cooperatives, there is a phenomenon of "dispersed work during the day, collective meetings at night." Fengming Cooperative was busy with expanding the cooperative in the previous period, resulting in no one in charge of production in the cooperative and poor preparation for winter planting. The whole cooperative was short of two cattle, but the new member Li Jinyou was planning to sell the cattle; wheat seeds were not checked, registered and centralized, and no one knew whether there was a shortage.

Second, the leading cadres in the cooperative still lack experience in managing collective production. The leading cadres of the new cooperatives are very active, but the main problem is the lack of methods. They have only heard a few experiences introduced by others at meetings or training classes, and have not yet directly gained experience in leading the cooperative. Xie Hongfang, director of the preparatory committee of Zhao Yuan Cooperative in Fengjie Township, said: "Since signing up, I have been worried all day long. A small family sometimes quarrels, how can this big family be commanded?" Cooperative affairs committee member Xie Jiaxian said: "Since the day I was elected as a member, I can't sleep at night. Thinking about it, I am always afraid that I will not be able to lead the cooperative well." They are also afraid that if they do a little poorly in handling economic problems or arranging production, they will "offend people" and "be scolded." In short, the leading cadres of the new cooperatives still lack management experience and dare not boldly be masters of their own affairs.

Third, there are still some problems in the thinking of the new members. Generally speaking, on the one hand, the new members have great trust in the cooperative, placing all their hopes on the cooperative, showing their determination and optimism to take the road of collectivization. Li Xuede (poor peasant), a new member of Fengming Cooperative, said: "It's great to join the cooperative this time. I will work to the end, and next year I will increase my income by at least one-third compared to this year." On the other hand, there is also a sense of dependence. They believe that with the cooperative, they don't have to worry about anything, and all problems and difficulties can be solved easily with the cooperative. Many new members reflected: This time I joined the cooperative, I don't have to worry about anything, I can clear my mind. Some said: "The cooperative cadres have experience, technology, and can calculate well in production. I just need to work." They regard running the cooperative well as the responsibility of the director or a few members, and do not see their own responsibilities and roles.

These problems are not difficult to solve as long as the leadership is strengthened. However, most of our staff members have developed a sense of complacency and a desire to rest after the expansion and establishment of the cooperatives. They did not see the complexity of these problems and believed that the establishment of the cooperative was a "great success and all is well." Therefore, they do not care about and help the leading cadres of the cooperative to lead production well. Although many cooperatives have made significant achievements in production, they are mainly based on a passion and a strong momentum. They have not done a good job in arranging with a plan and reasonably dividing the work. If we do not strengthen specific leadership, we will inevitably drift and cause artificial losses to production.

To help the new cooperative organize and arrange the current production. Rural staff members who help build the cooperatives, especially cooperative cadres, must establish a firm and unwavering basic view, that is, no matter at which stage of building the cooperative, they must not relax production, and they must lead the agricultural production cooperative to do a good job in production. If anyone separates the cooperative from production, only cares about building the cooperative and does not care about production, then that is a big mistake. After the cooperative is established, in addition to grasping the economic problems, it is necessary to grasp production. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth education on the purpose of running the cooperative and the idea of collectivism to all members, so that they can recognize the consistency between running the cooperative and production, establish the idea of "being the master of their own affairs," and give full play to the collective's strength and wisdom to jointly run the cooperative well. In specific practice, after the cooperative framework is set up, when dealing with economic problems, one or two strong and experienced members should be designated to be specifically responsible for leading production. Several temporary production groups or production teams should be divided under the cooperative's preparatory committee. At the same time, arrangements should be made for current production, and simple short-term plans should be made. When setting short-term plans, the agricultural affairs within the short-term plan time should be arranged in order to take care of public and private agricultural affairs and rationally arrange the order of work. When the above work is roughly completed, a meeting of cooperative members should be convened to carry out ideological mobilization, announce the short-term plan, and put forward the slogan of "striving to complete the plan, welcoming the handling of economic problems, and welcoming the election of the director and deputy director and the board of directors," to improve the enthusiasm of cooperative members for labor and organize the groups (teams) to propose conditions and carry out labor competitions.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the first short-term plan, the following specific problems must be solved: First, the quality of work must be clearly defined; unified and reasonable evaluation and scoring standards should be set. Second, because the economic problems within the cooperative have not yet been resolved, the reasons should be explained to the members, and the seeds, fertilizers, cattle, farm tools, etc. needed for current production should be uniformly allocated and used first, so as not to delay production. Third, while formulating the first short-term production plan, simple labor discipline should be determined through discussion by the cooperative members, such as obeying leadership, not being late or leaving early, not cutting corners, and not being selfish.

In the process of implementing the short-term production plan, we must start to carry out comprehensive production planning work, so that all members can clarify the general direction of production and improve their enthusiasm for labor.

    搭起了社架子就要抓住生产
    中共浙江省丽水县委书记  吴耀东
    最近我和几位同志一起下乡，看了几个新建社和新扩大的老社。我们看到大批新社员已经投入集体生产，新社员们对集体劳动都很感兴趣，干得特别有劲。凤街乡凤鸣社在集体生产的第一天，就有二十来个社员在一个下午盖起一间大灰库和修好一座牛屋，第二、三天都有二、三十个社员在一起担塘泥。这个社还买了双轮双铧犁和大批肥田粉，准备冬种。不过当前新建社在生产上有一个带有普遍性的问题，即生产管理比较混乱。这个问题是当前进行全面的生产规划和组织生产高潮的阻碍，需要立即加以妥善解决。
    这些新建社和扩大了的老社，新社员绝大部分是互助组转过来的，有的整组转，也有的转了一部分。原有的互助组不存在或者是拆散了，它已经提高到以土地入股、统一经营为主要特点的农业生产合作社。在这种组织形式转变的初期，必须要有比以前更加健全的生产组织，实行合理的分工，还要有一定程度上的生产计划性，才能把生产搞好。要想办到这样并不难，但丽水县目前新建社绝大部分还是雏型社（即架子社），社内许多经济问题还没有处理结束，社的领导机构也还没有正式建立，所有这些工作都还需要有一段时间的整顿，才能走上正轨。在这种情况下组织生产，是有一定的困难的。
    第一是生产管理上的问题比较错综复杂，主要是在生产上有公和私、先和后的双重矛盾。新社员收的是自家的，种的是集体的。到底先收还是先种？先收你的还是先收我的？这些问题往往成为安排生产的主要争论的焦点，所有这些矛盾都给社内的生产管理带来一定程度的困难。凤街乡赵元社有的筹备委员认为，还是先让社员干完自家活，再到社里干。因此，个别新社建立以后，有“白天分散干活，晚上集体开会”的现象。凤鸣社前一段因忙于搞扩大社的工作，弄得社内生产无专人负责，对冬种准备很差。全社实缺耕牛两头，而新社员李金友却打算把耕牛卖掉；麦种籽也未检查、登记和集中，到底缺不缺，谁也心中无数。
    第二是社内领导骨干还缺乏管理集体生产的经验。新建社的领导骨干都很积极，主要的问题是缺少办法，他们只是在会议或训练班上听到人家介绍的几条经验，还没有直接取得领导社的经验，一般都怕领导不了。凤街乡赵元社筹备委员会主任谢红芳说：“自从报名以后，我是一天到晚愁心，一个小家庭有时也会吵嘴，这个大家庭怎么指挥得了呢？”社务委员谢加先说：“从选我当委员那天起，夜里总是睡不着觉，想来想去，总怕不能把社领导得好。”他们还怕处理经济问题或安排生产稍有不好就要“得罪人”、“落人骂”。总之，新社的领导骨干还缺乏管理经验，还不敢大胆当家作主。
    第三是新社员思想上还有些问题。一般说，新社员一方面对合作社抱有莫大信任，把自己的一切希望都寄托给合作社，表现出他们走合作化道路的坚定性和乐观心理。凤鸣社新社员李学德（贫农）说：
  “这回参加合作社可好了，我要干到底，明年至少会比今年增加收入三分之一。”另方面也有一种依赖情绪，他们认为有了合作社，自己什么都不用担心了，一切问题和困难，有了合作社都可以迎刃而解。不少新社员反映：这回参加合作社自己什么都不用管了，可以清清心。有的说：“社里干部对生产有经验、有技术、会打会算，我只要干就行了。”他们把办好合作社看作是社长或几个委员的事，而看不到自己的责任和作用。
    以上这些问题只要加强领导都不难解决。但是，我们多数工作人员在扩社、建社结束以后，产生了自满情绪和歇一歇的思想，没有看到这些问题的复杂性，认为合作社成立起来就是“大功告成，万事大吉”了。因此，就不去关心和帮助社的领导骨干领导好生产。目前虽然有不少社在生产上做出了显著成绩，但是他们主要是靠一股热情、一股猛劲干起来的，有计划地进行安排、合理地进行分工都还做得很差。如再不加强具体领导，势必自流下去，给生产造成人为的损失。
    要帮助新社组织和安排好当前生产。帮助建社工作的农村工作人员特别是办社干部，必须树立一个坚定不移的基本观点，那就是无论在建社的哪一个阶段，都不能放松生产，都要领导农业合作社搞好生产。如果有人把办社和生产分割开来看，只管建社不管生产，那就是大错而特错了。社建立以后，除了抓紧处理好经济问题外，必须抓住生产。必须向全体社员进行一次全面深入的办社目的教育和集体主义思想教育，使他们认识到办社和生产的一致性，树立起“当家作主”思想，充分发挥集体的力量和智慧，共同协力办好合作社。在具体作法上，社架子搭起来以后，在处理经济问题的时候要指定一、二个强有力的而且生产有经验的委员专门负责领导生产。建社筹备委员会下面应该划分若干个临时的生产小组或生产队。同时，应该对当前生产作好安排，定出简单的小段计划。在定小段计划的时候，应该把本小段计划时间内的农事排好队，以便照顾公、私农事和合理安排干活先后次序。以上工作大体就绪，就应该召开社员大会，进行思想动员，宣布小段计划，提出“努力完成计划，迎接处理经济问题，迎接选举正、副社长和理事”的口号，提高社员劳动热情，组织各组（队）提出条件，开展劳动竞赛。
    为了保证第一个小段计划的胜利完成，必须解决以下几个具体问题：一、要明确规定干活的质量；定出统一合理的评工记分标准。二、因为社内经济问题尚未处理，应该向社员讲明道理，把当前生产所需的种籽、肥料、耕牛、农具等，先行统一调配使用，以免耽误生产。三、在制定第一个小段生产计划的同时，应该经过社员讨论定出简要的劳动纪律，如服从领导，不迟到不早退，不偷工减料，不自私自利等。
    在执行小段生产计划当中，就要着手进行全面生产规划工作，使全体社员明确总的生产方向，提高劳动积极性。
