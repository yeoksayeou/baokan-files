    Cultural Learning Upsurge Appears in Rural Shanxi Province
    The work of eliminating illiteracy in Shanxi Province has been accelerated. The province plans to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy among 70 percent of the province's young people (from now until the end of 1958) within three years. In order to accomplish this task, under the leadership of the Party and in coordination with the education departments, the Communist Youth League organizations will mobilize and organize one million young illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the province to enter people's schools to study this winter. The province has also organized and trained 100,000 educated youths to serve as volunteer teachers in people's schools. At the same time, 200,000 educated youths in the countryside have actively responded to the initiative of "each one eliminate one illiterate" and launched a contract teaching and learning movement.
    Now, a mass upsurge in cultural learning has begun to appear throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics, in the Jinan area alone, more than 10,000 people's schools have opened, with more than 340,000 young and middle-aged people enrolled. The masses have a great enthusiasm for learning culture, and "resolutely not being an illiterate" has become the unanimous demand and determination of young people throughout the province. More than 10,000 rural educated youths in Qixian, Xiaoyi, Yanggao, Taigu, Xiyang and other counties have organized contract teaching teams and contract teaching groups to fixedly help illiterate young farmers learn to read through contract teaching and learning methods. Sixty-three educated youths in Beizuo Village in Qixian County and Nanshahe in Taigu County have contracted to teach seventy illiterates who have difficulties in learning. After consultation between the two parties, they also signed a contract teaching and learning agreement. Jia Peixian, a graduate of Nanshahe Elementary School in Taigu County, contracted to teach a farmer couple. The husband could not attend classes regularly due to work, and the wife could not attend classes regularly because she had many children. Jia Peixian "delivered literacy to their door," teaching them to recognize two or three characters every day. Within a dozen days, they have been able to recognize twenty or thirty characters. Yang Shuan-dong, a member of the Communist Youth League in this village, has also organized a contract teaching and learning group in his own home. According to the principle of "learning for application," many Communist Youth League branches and agricultural cooperatives, such as Dongshenzhuang in Luan and Xiasile Village in Xiyang, have learned from the experience of the Ji Gong literacy class in Gaojia Liugou Village, Junan County, Shandong Province, and have compiled Ji Gong literacy textbooks (first book), Ji Gong literacy textbook word lists, etc.

    山西省农村出现文化学习高潮
    山西省扫除文盲工作已加快速度地开展起来。全省计划：在三年内（从现在到一九五八年底）完成扫除占全省青年总数的百分之七十的青年文盲的任务。为了完成这一任务，青年团组织在党的领导下，配合教育部门，在今冬要动员和组织全省一百万青年文盲和半文盲入民校学习。全省并且已经组织和训练了十万个知识青年充当了民校义务教师，同时组织二十万在乡知识青年，积极响应了“一人扫一盲”的倡议，开展了包教保学运动。
    现在，全省群众性的学习文化高潮已开始出现。据不完全统计，仅晋南区已有一万多座民校开学，有三十四万多青壮年入学。群众学习文化的热情很大，“坚决不当睁眼瞎”已成为全省青年的一致要求和决心。祁县、孝义、阳高、太谷、昔阳等县的一万多名农村知识青年，已经分别组织包教大队和包教小组，用包教保学的办法固定地帮助青年农民中的文盲识字。祁县北左村、太谷县南沙河的六十三个知识青年共包教了七十个学习上有困难的文盲，经过双方协商还订立了包教保学合同。太谷县南沙河高小毕业生贾培宪包教的一对农民夫妻，男的因为工作忙，女的因为孩子多，都不能随班学习。贾培宪就“送字上门”，每天教他们识两三个字，十几天内已能认识二、三十个字了。这个村的青年团员杨拴栋也在自己家里组织了一个包教保学小组。潞安东申庄、昔阳下思乐村等不少青年团支部、农业合作社，根据“学以致用”的原则，学习了山东莒南县高家柳沟村记工识字班的经验，编写了记工识字课本（第一本）、记工识字课本生字表等。
