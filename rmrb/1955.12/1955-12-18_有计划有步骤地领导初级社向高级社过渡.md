Leading the Transition from Elementary Agricultural Cooperatives to Advanced Cooperatives in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner
Ma Shiji

The semi-socialist elementary agricultural production cooperative is the primary form of the current agricultural cooperativization movement. In this type of cooperative, the means of production are partially collectively owned by the members. However, with the development of production and the raising of the socialist consciousness of the members, this type of cooperative will gradually abolish land remuneration and adopt various mutually beneficial methods to transfer major means of production such as draught animals, large farm implements, and agricultural transport tools to the collective ownership of all members. This is an inevitable trend in the objective development of the cooperativization movement.

Why is it said that the transition from elementary to advanced cooperatives is an inevitable trend in objective development? The development process of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wujiawa Township, Daren County, Shanxi Province, can answer this question. This cooperative was established in the spring of 1952 and was initially a small cooperative of only thirty-one households, but after one year, all the farmers in the village had joined the cooperative. In 1954, grain production increased by 62% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative; draught animals increased from seventy to one hundred and three; sheep increased from three hundred to eight hundred and forty (not including the eight hundred and twenty that were slaughtered and sold over the years); large farm implements increased approximately fourfold; and the afforestation area increased from four hundred and seventy-nine mu to one thousand six hundred mu. The development of production laid the foundation for gradually abolishing land remuneration. During the autumn harvest distribution in 1954, most of the members advocated abolishing land remuneration. After the cooperative's management committee made a trial calculation, it was deemed that the conditions were not yet fully ripe, so it was decided to deduct the public grain to be handed over from the originally stipulated 28% land dividend, and the cooperative would pay a fixed remuneration to the landowners and uniformly pay the agricultural tax. In 1955, the cooperative's production already exceeded the production level of well-to-do middle peasants, and a complete "payment according to labor" method was implemented. The distribution results showed that the income of all types of members increased compared to before the abolition of land remuneration, with no households experiencing a decrease. There were no more grain-deficient households in the entire cooperative, and the work and living problems of the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled members were basically resolved.

The public accumulation of this cooperative has also seen a significant increase. The public accumulation fund and public welfare fund have now increased to 9,936 yuan, with a share fund of 12,640 yuan, totaling 22,576 yuan, an average of 155 yuan per household. Eighty percent of the total value of draught animals, large farm implements, and transportation vehicles in the entire cooperative has been converted to public ownership, and the 1,600 mu of forest land is also completely publicly owned. The members said, "The cooperative's foundation is much larger than ours, and the cooperative's roots are much stronger than ours." Therefore, this winter, the transition to an advanced cooperative can be completed by expanding the publicly owned share fund to transform the main means of production into the collective ownership of all members. The members' private ownership concepts of land and draught animals are becoming increasingly blurred. They said: A standard mu of land yields a net rent of five to seven jin of grain (the land in the village is mostly of poor quality), while one workday can earn thirteen jin of grain. Having one standard mu of land is not as good as having one more workday. Why bother with private ownership of land? Therefore, the members' enthusiasm for labor is particularly high. Before joining the cooperative, each able-bodied laborer worked at most 130 days per year, while now each able-bodied laborer averages 240 workdays per year, with the highest reaching 340. In the past, women did not work in the fields, but now most women participate in labor. The labor utilization rate of the entire cooperative has doubled, which is the main source of the members' increased income. The members also see that the livestock raised collectively have ample feed and grass, and each animal is sleek and strong, so who would be willing to pull the livestock back for private ownership and feeding? The members' sense of collectivism has been strengthened. Zhang Zhenhai said, "The cooperative is the home, and the home is the cooperative." Therefore, based on this foundation, the transition to an advanced cooperative has become a very natural thing.

Some people say, "Since semi-socialist cooperatives can also increase production year after year, why must they gradually transform into large-scale advanced cooperatives?" Facts have proven that in cooperatives where the productive forces have greatly developed, the private ownership of land, draught animals, and other major means of production is already restricting the further development of the productive forces. First, the distribution system of land and labor jointly sharing profits affects the members' enthusiasm for labor. Especially in cooperatives that implement profit sharing based on the proportion of land and labor, the more production develops, the more land remuneration increases. Therefore, some members with more land believe that "With land remuneration, a little labor is enough." And members with less land are increasingly dissatisfied with this situation of "Whether you work or not, the land is cut in half." At the same time, the private ownership of the means of production also hinders the large-scale development of production. For example, some cooperatives need to build water conservancy projects and expand paddy fields to overcome drought and flood disasters; some cooperatives need to systematically plant trees to prevent wind and sand erosion; some cooperatives need to stop cultivating part of the land and return it to pasture, or cultivate large tracts of wasteland, according to the nature of the soil. However, the private ownership of land restricts the cooperative's unified planning and planned capital construction of the land. Some cooperatives need to use the existing old and weak draught animals to exchange for strong draught animals, increase animal power or systematically raise breeding females to breed livestock. However, the private ownership of livestock restricts the cooperative's unified adjustment and large-scale breeding of draught animals.

The transition from elementary agricultural cooperatives to advanced cooperatives is an inevitable law of objective development, but it is by no means something that can be achieved spontaneously. We must strengthen leadership, go deep into the masses, actively create conditions, promptly understand new situations and new problems, and actively and systematically guide this major transformation.

The transition from semi-socialist cooperatives to completely socialist cooperatives is a process of developing production, increasing socialist factors, and raising the political consciousness of members. From the first day of establishment, every development of production and every accumulation of public property has actually prepared a part of the conditions for the transition to advanced cooperatives. Therefore, we must consciously carry out various preparations in the semi-socialist cooperativization stage in order to complete the transition to advanced cooperatives in a planned and step-by-step manner in stages and batches.

First, since the fundamental problem lies in the continuous development of the productive forces, it is necessary to strengthen production leadership of existing cooperatives and implement an overall plan centered on cooperativization, so that the planned transition of small elementary cooperatives to large advanced cooperatives is closely linked to the planned development of production. Every old cooperative must set a production increase plan of half to one times; at the same time, there must be a comprehensive plan to gradually realize the public ownership of the main means of production in stages and batches. Cooperativized townships not only require short-term production plans for one cooperative and one village, but also need to gradually formulate long-term production plans for several cooperatives and several villages up to the entire township, according to natural and economic conditions. Only in this way can we encourage the socialist enthusiasm of the members with rich production content and ambitious production goals. Cooperatives should help each other economically and jointly organize some common production undertakings on the basis of mutual benefit.

Second, gradually expanding the accumulation of public property and gradually expanding the public ownership of the means of production on the basis of production development is the economic foundation for the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives.

With the development of production, the proportion of labor dividend must be gradually increased. Among the more than 5,000 new and old cooperatives in the Yanbei area, more than 99% have implemented the method of fixed land dividend, which will not cause the land remuneration to increase with the development of the entire cooperative's production, thereby ensuring the increase of labor remuneration and the accumulation of public property. In the Yanbei area, cooperatives that use land and labor for remuneration in proportion are in the minority, mainly distributed in villages with large populations, little land, and high yields. These cooperatives should gradually transform into fixed land remuneration amounts with the development of production. In addition, some cooperatives that meet the conditions can also adopt the practice of allowing a small number of elderly, weak, sick, and disabled members to retain fixed land remuneration for a certain period when abolishing land remuneration.

The methods for the public ownership of major means of production such as draught animals, large farm implements, and transportation vehicles are roughly two types: one is to implement public ownership in stages and batches. That is, with the growth of production, the cooperative evaluates the members' draught animals according to the local normal price, and then apportions a public ownership share fund every year, and uses the public accumulation fund to purchase a part every year until all are publicly owned. The advantage of this method is that poor members do not incur debt, and both middle and poor peasants are satisfied. However, the part purchased with the public accumulation fund should not be too large, otherwise it will affect the expansion of reproduction of the cooperative and cause a large amount of production funds to flow into the hands of the members, encouraging waste. The other method is for the cooperative to purchase the members' draught animals and farm implements according to the local normal price and transfer them to the public ownership of the entire cooperative at one time. Most of the price is paid by the public ownership share fund paid by the members in installments, and the rest is paid off by the public accumulation fund.

Third, strengthen the leadership of the Party and strengthen the Party's political and ideological work in the cooperatives. The transition from semi-socialism to complete socialism is still an extremely profound and extremely complex struggle. It is necessary to conduct education on the Party's general line in the transition period and education on class policies more systematically within the Party through the method of combining Party rectification and cooperative rectification, to further unify the thoughts and will of the Party members. It is necessary to overcome the capitalist tendencies of the peasants (mainly well-to-do middle peasants) and the habits of long-term individual management through typical demonstrations and persuasive education. At the same time, criticism and self-criticism should also be carried out frequently among the members of the cooperative, so that they can recognize the correct relationship between poor peasants and middle peasants, between individual interests and collective interests, between the interests of the cooperative and the interests of the state, and between current interests and long-term interests, and gradually cultivate the peasants into new-type peasants with collectivist thinking. We must always be vigilant against the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and various counter-revolutionary elements, and resolutely strike them down constantly.

Fourth, cultivate the leadership backbone of the cooperatives and improve the management level of existing cooperatives. The backbone leaders of large advanced cooperatives grow up from the leadership backbone of the current small elementary cooperatives. It is necessary to help existing cooperatives earnestly improve and improve the management system, so that the leadership backbone of the cooperatives can gradually learn the methods of managing large socialist economic organizations. At the same time, counties and townships should make overall plans for cultivating leadership backbone and systematically cultivate the main leading cadres of advanced cooperatives and agricultural technical personnel, financial and accounting personnel.

    有计划有步骤地领导初级社向高级社过渡
    马石纪
    半社会主义的初级形式农业生产合作社，是当前农业合作化运动的主要形式。在这种合作社中，生产资料是为社员部分集体所有的。但是，随着生产的发展和社员社会主义觉悟的提高，这种合作社就要逐步地取消土地报酬，并且采取各种互利办法，把耕畜、大型农具、农业运输工具等主要生产资料陆续地转为全体社员集体所有。这是合作化运动客观发展的必然趋势。
    为什么说初级社过渡到高级社是客观发展的必然趋势呢？山西省大仁县吴家洼乡陈家庄农业生产合作社的发展过程可以回答这个问题。这个社是一九五二年春建立的，第一年只是一个三十一户的小社，但是过了一年全村农户都加入了这个社。一九五四年，粮食产量比建社前增加了百分之六十二；耕畜由七十头增加到一百零三头；羊由三百只增加到八百四十只（几年杀卖的八百二十只未计在内）；大型农具约增加四倍；造林面积由四百七十九亩增加到一千六百亩。生产的发展给逐步取消土地报酬奠定了基础。一九五四年秋收分配的时候，大部分社员就主张取消土地报酬，经过社务委员会试算之后，认为条件还没有完全成熟，便决定在原规定的百分之二十八的土地分益中减去应交公粮，由社付给土地所有者固定报酬，由社统一交纳农业税。一九五五年这个社的生产已经超过了富裕中农的生产水平，便实行了完全“按劳付酬”的办法。分配结果，各类社员的收入比取消土地报酬前都有增加，没有一户减少。全社没有了缺粮户，老弱病残社员的工作和生活问题基本上得到了解决。
    这个合作社的公共积累也有了显著增长。现在公积金和公益金已经增加到九千九百三十六元，拥有股份基金一万二千六百四十元，两项合计是二万二千五百七十六元，每户平均有一百五十五元。全社耕畜、大农具、运输车辆总值的百分之八十已经转为公有，一千六百亩林木也完全属于公有。社员们说：“社的底子比咱大得多，社的根子比咱硬得多。”因此，今年冬季可以用扩大公有化股份基金的办法把主要生产资料转变为全体社员集体所有，完成向高级社的过渡。社员对于土地、耕畜的私有观念日益淡漠了。他们说：一个标准亩得纯地租五到七斤粮（该村土地多质量坏），而一个劳动日能分十三斤粮，有一个标准亩不如多有一个劳动日，要那土地私有干什么？因此社员的劳动积极性特别高涨，入社前每个整劳力每年最多不过劳动一百三十天，现在每个整劳力每年平均的劳动日是二百四十个，最高的达三百四十个。过去妇女不下地，现在多数妇女参加了劳动。全社劳动力利用率增加了一倍，这就是社员们增加收入的主要源泉。社员们也看到集体喂养的牲口料多草足，牲口一个个毛光力壮，这样，谁还愿意把牲口拉回去私有私喂呢？社员的集体观念增强了，张振海说：“社就是家，家就是社。”所以在这个基础上过渡到高级社，就成了一件很自然的事情。
    有人说：“既然半社会主义的合作社也能连年增产，为什么一定要逐步转变为大型的高级合作社呢？”事实证明，在生产力有了很大发展的合作社中，土地、耕畜等主要生产资料的私有制已经在限制生产力的进一步发展。首先，土地和劳力共同分益的分配制度影响了社员的劳动积极性。特别是在实行土地和劳力按比例分益的合作社里，生产越发展，土地报酬也越增加，因此，有些土地多的社员便认为“有了土地报酬，多少劳动一点就行啦”；而土地少的社员对于这种“干不干，土地砍一半”的情况也越来越不满意。同时，生产资料的私有，也妨碍生产的大规模发展。例如，有的社需要兴修水利、扩大水田以战胜旱涝灾害；有的社需要有计划地植树造林，以防风砂侵袭；有的社按照土壤性质需要把一部分土地停耕、还牧，或者垦植大片荒地；但是，土地私有制限制了合作社对土地的统一规划和有计划的基本建设。有的社需要用现有的老弱耕畜去调换强壮的耕畜，增加畜力或有计划地饲养母畜，繁殖牲畜，但是，牲畜私有限制了社内对耕畜的统一调整和大量繁殖。
    由初级农业合作社转变到高级社，是客观发展的必然规律，但是决不是可以自流地达到的，我们必须加强领导，深入群众，积极地创造条件，及时了解新情况和新问题，积极地、有计划地指导这一重大的变革。
    由半社会主义的合作社过渡到完全社会主义的合作社，是一个发展生产、增长社会主义因素、提高社员政治觉悟的过程。从建社第一天起，每一项生产的发展，每一项公共财产的积累，实际上都为过渡到高级社准备了一部分条件。所以我们必须在半社会主义的合作化阶段就自觉地进行各项准备，以便有计划有步骤地分期分批地完成向高级社的过渡。
    第一、既然根本问题在于生产力的不断发展，因此必须加强对现有合作社的生产领导，必须实行以合作化为中心的全面规划，使小型的初级社向大型的高级社有计划地过渡同有计划地发展生产紧密结合起来。每一个老社都要定出增产半倍到一倍的增产计划；同时要有分期分批逐步实现主要生产资料公有化的通盘计划。合作化的乡不但要求有短期的一社一村的生产计划，而且要按照自然条件和经济条件，逐步制定几个社几个村直到全乡的长期的生产规划。这样才能以丰富的生产内容和远大的生产目标鼓舞社员的社会主义积极性。社和社之间要在经济上互相帮助，在互利基础上联合举办一些共同的生产事业。
    第二、在生产发展的基础上逐步扩大公共财产的积累，逐步扩大生产资料的公有化，是由初级社转向高级社的经济基础。
    随着生产的发展，劳动分益的比例必须逐步增长。雁北地区五千多个新、老社中，有百分之九十九以上的社实行了固定土地分益的办法，这就不会使土地报酬随着全社生产的发展而增加，从而保证劳动报酬的增加和公共财产的积累。雁北地区采用土地和劳动按比例付酬的社是少数的，主要分布在人口多、土地少，产量高的村庄，这些社应该随着生产的发展逐步转变为固定土地报酬数量。此外，有些条件成熟的合作社在取消土地报酬时，采取让少数老弱病残社员在一定时期内仍保留固定的土地报酬的做法，也是可以采取的。
    耕畜、大型农具、运输车辆等主要生产资料公有化的办法大体有两种：一种是分期分批实行公有。即随着生产的增长，按照当地正常价格把社员耕畜作价，然后每年摊派一部公有化股份基金，每年用公积金收买一部，直到全部公有。这一办法的好处是贫苦社员不背债，中农、贫农都满意。但是用公积金收买的部分不能过大，否则会影响合作社的扩大再生产，并且使大量生产资金流入社员手里，助长浪费。另一种办法是把社员的耕畜、农具由合作社按照当地的正常价格收买，一次转为全社公有。价款的大部由社员分期交纳的公有化股份基金付出，其余由公积金付清。
    第三、加强党的领导，加强党在合作社中的政治思想工作。由半社会主义转到全社会主义，仍然是一场极深刻、极复杂的斗争。必须通过整党整社相结合的办法，在党内更有系统地进行党在过渡时期的总路线的教育和阶级政策的教育，进一步统一党员的思想意志。必须通过典型示范和说服教育的方式来克服农民（主要是富裕中农）的资本主义倾向和长期个体经营的习惯。同时还应该在合作社社员中经常地开展批评和自我批评，使他们认识贫农和中农之间、个人利益和集体利益之间、合作社利益和国家利益之间、目前利益和长远利益之间的正确关系，把农民逐步培养成具有集体主义思想的新型农民。对于地主、富农和各种反革命分子的破坏活动，要时刻提高警惕，不断地坚决地给以打击。
    第四、培养社的领导骨干，提高现有社的经营管理水平。领导大型的高级社的骨干是从现在小型的初级社的领导骨干中生长起来的，必须帮助现有社认真改善和健全经营管理制度，使社的领导骨干逐步学会管理大型的社会主义经济组织的方法。同时，县、乡应该做出培养领导骨干的全盘规划，有计划地培养高级社的主要领导干部和农业技术人材、财务会计人材。
