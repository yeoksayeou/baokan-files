Eradicating Illiteracy in a Village

The cadres and young illiterates of Shatuo Village, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, have basically eliminated illiteracy.

By August 1955, over the past six years, a total of 96 illiterates had been eliminated, and 101 illiterates had been raised to the level of semi-literate. All four village schools persisted in learning during the busy farming season and the intense drought resistance movement this year.

Now, the Communist Party, Communist Youth League, administrative organizations, and agricultural producers' cooperative workers in this village have made a comprehensive plan to basically eliminate illiteracy in the village during the first Five-Year Plan period, mobilizing all unenrolled illiterates and semi-literates to enroll in school, and continue to improve the cultural level of 218 non-illiterates.

    一个村的扫除文盲工作
    辽宁省复县沙坨村全村干部和青年文盲已基本扫除。
    到一九五五年八月为止，六年来，全村共扫除了文盲九十六名，有一百零一名文盲提高为半文盲。全村四个民校在今年农忙季节和紧张的抗旱运动中，一直坚持学习。
    现在，这个村的共产党、青年团、行政组织和农业生产合作社的工作人员已作出了在第一个五年计划期间基本上扫除全村文盲的全面计划，动员未入学的文盲和半文盲全部入学，并且继续提高二百一十八个非文盲的文化水平。

    沙坨村的党支部书记、团支部书记同星火农业生产合作社的工作人员讨论民校的教学工作。
    扫盲班在地里通过实物进行教学，使学习获得更大的成效。
    民校的学员们已经能够通过黑板报向农民宣传“三定”政策。
    高小毕业生和知识青年对多子女的妇女进行个别教育，并且订了“包教包学”的合同。
    由于扫除文盲工作收到一定的效果，村里的文化娱乐活动也有了开展。
    村里团支部设立了一个图书馆，青年农民们常到这里来借阅书报。
