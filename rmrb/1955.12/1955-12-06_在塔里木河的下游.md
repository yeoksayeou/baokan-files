    In the Lower Reaches of the Tarim River
    Chu Anping
    In June of this year, I visited a small village in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The residents of this village used to fish for a living year-round and ate grass roots. They wore rough burlap sacks and would run away at the sight of strangers, hiding in the reeds or sand dunes. Because few people knew the way to this village, we had to change guides station by station. We set off from Yuli County, heading west along the northern bank of the Peacock River. The wild tung trees along the way were lush and lovely. Later, after crossing the Peacock River and passing through Qunkel Village, the road wound through many small rivers and marshes. The rivers were full of fish, and some were adorned with delicate wild lotus flowers. The further south we went, the more pronounced the Gobi landscape became. Some places were covered in sand dunes, on which grew tamarisk trees of mixed yellow and green. We often saw swans swimming by the lake, and large eagles with piercing eyes perched by the roadside, only taking flight when our vehicle approached. Looking southwest into the distance, we saw whirlwinds spiraling upwards, reaching for the sky, a common sight in the Gobi.
    We initially traveled on the main road leading to Ruoqiang. At Kala, we left the main road and headed west towards the eastern edge of the Tarim Great Gobi. From Kala, through Yingkeer, to Kelacheqi, the road was full of grass, shrubs, and sand pits. The path was intermittent, making it difficult to navigate. After eight hours of driving under the scorching, windless Gobi sun, we finally approached the sand dunes winding along the eastern edge of the Tarim Great Gobi. The sand dunes were not very high, but they had their own charm. The neat ridges and flattened slopes, as if ironed, gave me an extremely simple, fresh, and profound impression. At the foot of these winding sand dunes flowed the historically renowned, expansive, and untamed Tarim River, originating from hundreds of miles away.
    Even before we reached Kelacheqi, the sound of the car engine had disturbed the peace of this small village. The villagers, with amazement, curiosity, and apprehension, craned their necks to look around. Someone spotted a black beetle-like object in the distant sandpit, inching closer to them. Their first reaction was to assume that we must have taken the wrong road, because no car had ever come to this village before. Since liberation, county and district cadres, Han cadres, and local ethnic cadres had often come, but they had never received guests who specifically came to visit them. When they learned that I was from Beijing and had come specifically to visit them, a cheer immediately erupted from the crowd. People rushed forward to shake my hand enthusiastically, even the youngest women did not feel shy.
    This was no longer the flat sandy land we usually see, but rather sand ridges shaped like waves by the wind. The sand ridges were not very high, about two or three meters. Occasionally, some tamarisk or reeds struggled out of the sand. The entire village was surrounded by such an endless sea of sand.
    We were led to a row of low houses at the east end of the village. They specially cooked fresh Tarim River fish to treat me.
    A long, long time ago, this area was also a place of abundant water and lush grass. Later, in the upper reaches of the Tarim River, some landlords and despots arbitrarily blocked the river water, causing the water source in the lower reaches to gradually dry up. On the way, we saw a place where many withered trees, looking as if they had been burned by a fire, still remained. It is said that this was the remnant of "the water having left." For many years, places like the area I visited had been reduced to "flood irrigation land." There was usually no water, and water would only flow here when the snow melted in the mountains and the upstream flooded. Due to the uneven terrain and the varying strength of the water flow, the water would flood wherever it reached each year, without any certainty. When the water came, everyone would block some of the low-lying areas of the land to hold the water. By the following spring, the water had seeped into the ground, so they would sow seeds on the land, and that land would be considered planted. In the past, even in such difficult circumstances, feudal landlords and village officials still did not relax their cruel exploitation. Because it was uncertain each year which land would be flooded and could be planted, the land had to be divided once every spring. I visited an old man named Bairati, who said, "We did all the hard work of building dams and blocking water when the floods came, but the village chief and security chief were entirely in charge of the land distribution. They occupied the better land, and the land they gave us was small and poor. We had no choice but to plant it, and we still had to bow and thank them. In the past, we poor people could only get enough land to plant fifty catties of seeds at most each year, but the landlords and village security chiefs occupied land that could plant more than a thousand catties of seeds. They didn't work themselves, and we all had to help them plant that land."
    On the small piece of land allocated to the peasants, if the year was good, they could harvest three or four hundred catties of grain. If the year was bad, they would harvest whatever they could. But whether the year was good or bad actually had nothing to do with the peasants, because if they harvested more, the village security chief would come, imposing this levy and that tax, and in the end, they would still give it to them. The old man Bairati pointed to the haizi (lakes) on the other side of the Tarim River and said, "No one knows what kind of life we people in this area used to live. Anyway, since we were children, we have been living on fish and grass roots all year round!"
    This suffering has finally ended! After liberation, this place has undergone unprecedented historical changes. Although there was no land reform because this area was all "flood irrigation land" and there was no land ownership, the evil forces of the feudal landlords and village security chiefs were quickly driven away by the liberated working people. Soon after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, they elected their own township chiefs and village chiefs. In the past, they divided the land once a year; now, they still divide the land once a year. But in the past, the land distribution was controlled and decided by the landlords and village security chiefs, and the peasants dared not say a word. Now, the land is distributed under the leadership of the township chief, and cadres are also sent from the district to participate. The village first studies and consults, and then distributes the land after everyone agrees. The biggest difficulty in this area is the lack of water, but in 1952, less than three years after liberation, a historic event occurred in the lives of the people in this area: In the spring of that year, the Yuli County People's Government, in order to take care of the production and life of the people in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, led many people to build a large dam in the upper reaches, so that the Tarim River water no longer flowed into the Peacock River, but flowed back to the lower reaches along the old course of the Tarim River. The return of the water greatly improved the production enthusiasm of the people in the lower reaches. In 1953, there was even a bumper harvest that had not been seen for many years.
    "The water is more abundant than before, and the land we get is also more and better than before. Take me, for example, I got land to plant five hundred catties of seeds this year. A family of three like mine can get land to plant five hundred catties of seeds, which has never happened before," said the old man Bairati, especially excited when he talked about the production situation in their village in the past two years: "In the past, when we planted crops, we never watered them again, and we didn't care about anything, just waiting for the harvest. If there was a harvest, we would harvest it; if there was no harvest, we would just let it go. Now it's different. Because no one oppresses us or exploits us anymore, and everything we harvest is our own, everyone is much more active in production than before. When the township government called for weeding the year before last, some people were not very willing, saying that they had never weeded before, and that the weeds would grow back even after they were pulled, so why bother. Only five or six households weeded that year, but the crops that were weeded were indeed different: the wheat grew taller, and the ears were bigger. So, from last year, everyone believed the government's words and was willing to weed. In the past, poor people rarely had livestock. Most of the livestock belonged to the landlords and village security chiefs. If their livestock trampled or ate the crops in our fields, no one dared to say a word. Now, in addition to weeding, we have also organized some young people to patrol the fields to see if any livestock or wild boars are eating the crops. Recently, we also organized a water conservancy team, which is digging a canal to bring more water up to expand production."
    While I was talking to Bairati, a middle-aged man named Asimu barged in. This Asimu was the only person in this small village who had been out and about. Asimu's family had fifteen members, three of whom could weave pockets (for storing grain) from wool and wild hemp. After weaving the pockets, Asimu would take them to Yanqi and sell them. Before 1952, Asimu would always drive a few small donkeys, carrying dozens of pockets, to the Yanqi area, sell the pockets, and then bring back some corn. But since 1952, Asimu has never gone out again, and they have even stopped weaving pockets. I asked him why. He said: "In the past, we didn't have enough to eat, so we had to weave some wool into pockets and take them out to exchange for grain. We could only lay some reed mats in our house, and we used to sleep on reed mats all year round. Since 1952, the government has taken care of us and built a large dam in the upper reaches. The water source in our area has greatly increased, and everyone's production has improved. With improved production, we want to improve our lives and want to make some felt carpets to lay on the ground. There weren't many livestock in our village to begin with, so our little bit of wool wasn't even enough for our own use, and we didn't have any extra wool to weave pockets. Moreover, we no longer need to take pockets to exchange for grain. Since 1952, I have never brought grain back from outside. On the contrary, last year, in response to the government's call to sell surplus grain, I also sold 1,500 catties of wheat and 400 catties of rapeseed to the government."
    The lower reaches of the Tarim River are a place where wild hemp is abundant. When we went, it was the season when wild hemp flowers were in full bloom. The earthy red wild hemp flowers added a lot of scenery to the barren Gobi area. The local villagers in this area have known how to use wild hemp to weave cloth and pockets for a long time. I have also seen blankets woven from wild hemp, which are thick and durable. They also dye the wild hemp in several different colors and weave out some simple stripes, which have a unique and attractive ethnic style. However, the reactionary government in the past never knew how to utilize this raw material. After liberation, under the advocacy of the Party and the government, wild hemp has become a valuable raw material for high-grade textiles. I have personally seen very good textiles made of wild hemp from Shanghai in Xinjiang. The government started to purchase wild hemp in large quantities from 1953. Peeling wild hemp is now the main side occupation of the local villagers in this area, especially women. In the past, wild hemp was always used to cover roofs, pave roadbeds, and burn as firewood. Many people say that after the Communist Party came, things that were worthless in the past have now become valuable. A woman can buy a set of clothing by peeling wild hemp for ten days. They show a special interest when they talk about this issue. They don't need to send the peeled wild hemp anywhere to sell it themselves. The supply and marketing cooperative sends cars to collect it on time. They sell the long, good ones to the government and keep the short, inferior ones for their own use at home.
    Although I only stayed there for two days, I saw the changes that had taken place in this small village. I asked them if they still ate fish, and they said with a very proud look: "In 1950, a few people were already eating grain; in 1951, many people were eating grain; from 1952, no one here used fish as their staple food anymore. Now no one eats grass roots anymore. Now we still eat fish two or three times a week, but fish is no longer our staple food, but a side dish." In the morning and evening (the desert area is especially cool in the morning and evening), I also saw some elderly people wearing tattered, rough burlap robes that they had left over from the past. When I was examining this kind of clothing on an old man, he said, "We used to wear this kind of clothing. Don't look down on it because it's rough, but it's very durable. In the past, our best clothes were dialian cloth (very coarse homespun cloth), but people only wore dialian cloth during the New Year. And now, people only wear this kind of dialian cloth when working in the fields." As he was speaking, two women happened to walk past us. The old man pointed his mouth and said, "Look at those women, now they are all wearing red and colorful cloth." In this village, burlap and dialian cloth can still be seen, but more often you see cotton cloth of various colors, and some young men are even wearing striped cloth shirts.
    I saw them using wooden buckets, wooden basins, wooden bowls, and wooden spoons. By the river, I saw their dugout canoes. Under some shaded sheds covered with reeds, I saw some women still weaving cloth with weaving machines made of two wooden forks and three wooden planks. But I also noticed that porcelain teapots, porcelain bowls, and tin buckets had appeared in their lives. They love to drink tea, but in the past, no one knew how much a piece of tea cost. Now adults and children all drink tea. No one pays attention to those flints that were indispensable to their past lives anymore. Now everyone uses matches. A box of matches has ten packs and only costs five jiao. I said, "You also raise chickens!" Asimu said, "This has also only happened in the past two years. In the past, if you raised chickens, you would be inviting the village security chief to make trouble for you. And in the past, we didn't even have enough to eat, so what could we use to raise chickens!"
    This small village never had a primary school in the past. From the autumn of 1954, the village also had a primary school. When Asimu talked about this issue, he said: "After liberation, the villagers all asked for a primary school to be established. Times have changed. Being illiterate is like being blind. Not only can you not read the newspaper, but you can't even understand the documents that come from above. In such a Gobi desert, if no one is literate, where can you find someone to read the documents that come from above? In November 1953, we held a general election here, and we elected our own representatives. Later, we raised this issue to the County People's Congress. In the autumn of 1954, our village had a primary school. This made everyone feel even more the benefits of the people having their own government."
    Many people in the village gathered in our small house, quietly and attentively listening to our conversation. Later, I saw an old man with a very long white beard (later I learned that his name was Jiamali), supported by a seven- or eight-year-old child, groping his way into our house step by step. It seemed that he wanted to talk to me about something. Everyone helped him to walk over from the crowd. His eyes were not blind, but the light coming from his pupils was like that of a blind person, not focused on any one place. He seemed to be gazing at me, but there was no special expression. He was trembling a little. He also seemed to have difficulty speaking. He said, "In the past, the village security chief came, riding a tall horse, holding a whip, and would whip people first before saying anything, to drag us to other places to do hard labor. Now, no one hits us anymore. I heard that Chairman Mao sent people to ask how we are. I can't see Chairman Mao, I want to come and see the people sent by Chairman Mao. I have nothing to say, I just want to thank Chairman Mao." As he said this, he suddenly threw himself to the ground and kowtowed. His solemn, sincere, and aged expression deeply moved me. His sudden action suddenly made me extremely nervous. I immediately knelt down solemnly to return his bow, kindly and with the feeling of a junior, and helped him up. Everyone in the house also stood up at this time. The insults, disasters, and sufferings that the people in this area had encountered in the old days, as well as the pure and sincere gratitude that they had aroused from the bottom of their hearts to the Party and Chairman Mao after liberation, were thoroughly expressed in this quiet, moving, and inexpressible occasion.

    在塔里木河的下游
    储安平
    今年六月，我在塔里木河的下游访问了一个小村。这个村子的居民过去终年捕鱼为食，并且吃草根；他们穿的是粗糙的麻袋布，见了外面去的陌生人拔脚就跑，一下子都躲进了芦丛或沙山。由于很少人知道通达这个村子的路径，我们只能一站一站地换人带领。我们从尉犁县城出发，沿着孔雀河的北岸西行。一路都是野生的梧桐，碧绿可爱。后来渡过孔雀河，穿过群克尔村，道路就穿行在许多小河和湖沼中间。那些小河里鱼很多，有些还浮生着娇艳的野荷花。越往南走，戈壁的景象越发浓厚。有些地方尽是沙墩，沙墩上长着黄绿相杂的红柳。经常看到天鹅在湖边游，而两眼矍矍的大鹰，雄踞路旁，直到我们车子驶近，才突然惊飞。向西南远方看去，见有旋风上卷，一柱冲天，这又是戈壁中的常见的景色。
    我们最初是在通往婼羌的大道上走着的。到了卡拉，便离开大路朝西向着塔里木大戈壁的东部边缘前进。从卡拉，经过英可尔，通往客拉切其，一路都是草丛、杂木和沙窝。路径若连若断，使人不辨进退。我们在那烤人的没有一丝丝风的戈壁太阳下驶行了八小时以后，终于越来越挨近蜿蜒在塔里木大戈壁东沿一带的沙山。沙山不很高，然而另有风致。那像被熨斗熨过了似的齐整的山棱和贴平的坡面，给我一种极其单纯、新鲜而又深刻的印象。就在这蜿蜒的沙山脚下，流着来自千里以外、历史上久享盛名的这条旷达的、豪壮的、同时也是桀傲不驯的塔里木河。
    当我们还没有到达客拉切其的时候，汽车马达的声音已经把这个平静的小村扰乱了起来。村里的人们，都怀着讶异、新奇而又紧张的心情，伸着脖子四面探望。有人发现在远远的沙窝里有着一个黑色甲虫似的东西一点一点向他们驶近。他们的第一个反应就是认为我们一定是走错路了，因为自有这个村子以来，就没有到过汽车。解放以后，县区干部、汉族干部和当地民族干部虽然常来，但是他们还没有接待过专门去访问他们的客人。当他们知道我是从北京来的、是专门去访问他们的时候，人群里马上腾起了一片欢呼。人们争着涌上前来和我热情地握手，即使最年轻的妇女也不感到一丝害羞。
    这儿已经不是我们通常所见到的那些平平的沙地，而是被风吹成像波浪似的一道一道的沙岗。沙岗不很高，大约两三公尺光景。沙岗上间或露着一些从沙子里挣扎出来的红柳或苇子。整个村子就被包围在这样一望无边的沙浪里面。
    我们被引导到村子东头的一排矮小的屋子里。他们特地煮了新鲜的塔里木河的鱼招待我。
    很久很久以前，这一带本来也是水足草茂的地方。后来，在塔里木河的上游，有些地主恶霸任意截拦河水，就使下游一带水源日见枯竭。我们在路上曾经看到一个地方残存着很多像被大火烧过似的枯死的大树，据说这就是“水走了”的遗迹。多年以来，像我所访问的那一带地方，都已沦为“洪水漫浇地”，平时没有水，要到大山化雪，上游发着洪水的时候，才有水流到这儿来。由于地势高低不一，水势有强有弱，每年的水漫到哪儿就是哪儿，没有一定。水漫到了，大家就把那块地的一些低洼的地方堵起来，把水堵住。到第二年春天，水已经渗入地下，于是就在地上撒种，这样，那块地就算种上了。过去，即使在这样困苦的情况下，封建地主乡约仍然不放松他们的残酷的剥削。由于每年究竟哪些地漫到了水、可以种，没有一定，所以每年春天都要分一次地。我访问过一个叫作白拉提的老汉，他说：“洪水来时，拦坝堵水这些苦工都是我们做的，但是分地的时候，全由乡保长作主。好一些的地，都由他们占了，分给我们的地，又少又不好。我们不能不种，还要向他们鞠躬道谢。在过去，我们这些穷人每年最多只能分到种五十斤种籽的地，但是那些地主乡保长占的地，却可以种到一千斤种籽以上。他们自己不劳动，那些地还是要我们大伙儿分着帮他们种。”
    在农民分到的这一点小土地上，要是年成好，可以收上三四百斤粮，要是年成不好，那就收多少算多少。可是年成好不好，实际上和农民没有什么关系，因为要是多收了些，乡保长就来了，摊派这个又摊派那个，到头还是送给他们了事。那个白拉提老汉用手指了指塔里木河那边的海子（湖沼）说：“没有人知道我们这一带的人从前过的是什么日子，反正我们从小时候起，就是整年靠吃鱼吃草根过活的！”
    这种苦难现在终于结束了！解放以后，这地方起了前所未有的历史性变化。虽然由于这一带都是“洪水漫浇地”，不存在土地所有权问题，因而也没有进行土地改革，然而那些封建地主乡保长的恶势力，却很快地被解放后的劳动人民赶跑了。解放不久，他们在党的领导下就选出了自己的乡长和村长。过去，他们每年分一次地，现在，他们仍然每年分一次地。可是过去分地是由地主乡保长支配作主，农民不敢说一句话。现在分地，则由乡长领导，区上还派干部来参加，先由村上研究协商，大家同意后再分。这一带的最大的困难是缺水，可是在一九五二年，解放了还不到三年，一件历史性的大事在这一带人民的生活里出现了：尉犁县人民政府为了照顾塔里木河下游一带人民的生产和生活，在那年春天，领导很多群众在上游筑了一个大坝，使塔里木河的河水不再流入孔雀河，使河水仍循塔里木河的故道流到下游来。水的回来，使下游各地人民的生产情绪大大提高了。在一九五三年，那一带竟然出现了一次多年未有的大丰收。
    “水比从前富裕了，分到的地也比从前又多又好了，就拿我说，我今年分到种五百斤种籽的地。像我这样只有三口人的一户人家，能分到种五百斤种籽的地，这在过去是从来没有过的。”白拉提老汉一扯到他们村上这两年来的生产情况，就格外兴奋：“过去我们种地，种了以后从来不再浇水，什么都不管，只等秋收。有收即收，没有收成也就算了。现在可不同了。由于再没有人压迫我们、剥削我们，收的都是我们自己的了，大家对于生产就比过去积极得多。前年乡政府号召拔草时，有些人还不大愿意，说过去从来没有拔过草，而且草拔了以后还是要长出来，何必白费劲。那年只有五六户拔了，可是拔了草的，长出来的庄稼确实不同：麦子长得高，麦穗结得大，所以从去年起，大家都相信政府的话，愿意拔草了。过去，穷人很少有牲口，牲口大都是地主乡保长的，他们的牲口踏了或者吃了我们地里的庄稼，谁也不敢哼一声。现在，除了拔草以外，我们还组织了一些青年在地里巡逻，看看有没有牲口或者野猪吃庄稼。最近又组织了一支水利队，正在挖一条水渠，想把更多的水引上来，好扩大生产。”
    在我和白拉提谈话的时候，一个叫阿西木的中年汉子闯了进来。这位阿西木是这个小村子上仅有的一位在外面跑过的人物。阿西木一家十五口，其中有三个妇女会用羊毛和野麻编织口袋（装粮用的），织了口袋，就由阿西木拿到焉耆一带去卖。在一九五二年以前，阿西木每年总要赶着几个小毛驴，带上几十个口袋，到焉耆一带去，把口袋卖掉了，就换一些包谷驮回来。可是一九五二年以后，阿西木就再没有出去过，甚至他们连口袋也不再织了。我问他为什么？他说：“过去我们没吃的，不得不把一些羊毛都织成口袋，拿出去换粮驮回来。我们屋子里一直只能铺些苇席，我们过去就整年地睡在苇席上。从一九五二年起，政府照顾我们，在上游筑了大坝，河水流回下游，我们这一带的水源大大增加，大家的生产都提高了。生产提高了，我们就想把自己的生活改好一些，都想打些毡毯铺在地上。我们村上牲口本来不多，这样一来，我们这一点点羊毛连自己用也不够了，再没有多余的羊毛拿出来织口袋了。而且，我们也不再需要拿口袋去换粮食了，从一九五二年起，我就没有再从外面驮回粮食过。正相反，去年我们响应政府出售余粮的号召，我还卖给政府一千五百斤小麦和四百斤菜籽呢。”
    塔里木河下游是盛产野麻的地方。我们去的时候，正是野麻花盛开的季节，土红色的野麻花，给那荒芜的戈壁地带添上了不少景色。这一带的老乡很久以来就知道利用野麻织布织口袋。我还看过他们用野麻织成的毯子，又厚又结实。他们并且把野麻染上几种不同的颜色，织出一些简单的条纹，另具一种引人的民族风格。可是过去的反动政权从来不知道利用这项原料。解放以后，在党和政府的提倡下，野麻竟然成了一种高级纺织品的宝贵原料。我在新疆亲眼看到过上海寄来的用野麻纺织的很好的纺织品。政府从一九五三年开始，大量收购野麻。剥野麻现在成为这一带的老乡、尤其是妇女的主要副业。野麻这东西过去一向被人们铺屋顶、垫路基、当柴烧。很多人说，共产党来了以后，一向不值钱的东西现在也变得值钱了，一个妇女剥上十天野麻，就可以换购一身衣料；她们一谈到这个问题，都显出一种特殊的兴趣。她们剥了野麻也用不着自己送到什么地方去卖，供销合作社会按时派车去收。她们都把长的好的卖给政府，短的次的留着自己家里用。
    我虽然在那儿只耽了两天，然而却看到了这个小村子所发生的变化。我问他们现在还吃不吃鱼，他们带着很得意的神气说：“一九五○年的时候，已有少数人吃到粮了；一九五一年，很多人都吃粮了；从一九五二年起，我们这儿再没有人把鱼作为主食了。现在再没有人吃草根了。现在我们一星期还吃两三次鱼，但是鱼不再是我们的主食，而是副食了。”在早上夜晚（沙漠地带早晚特别凉），我还看到一些老年人身上披着他们从前穿剩下来的破烂的粗糙的麻袋布袷袢，当我有一次端详着一个老汉身上的这种衣服时，他说：“过去我们就是穿的这种衣服。你别瞧它粗，可结实着哩。在过去，我们最好的衣服是褡连布（很粗的土大布），可是褡连布也还只有过年的时候才有人穿。而现在，人们只有在地里劳动时才穿这种褡连布了。”说着时，正巧有两个妇女走过我们身边，那个老汉呶呶嘴：“你瞧那些娘儿们，现在她们都穿上红颜色的花布了。”在这村上，麻袋布和褡连布还是看得到，可是更多地看到的是各色棉布，有些年轻小伙子身上还穿着带条纹的布衬衫。
    我看到他们用木桶、木盆、木碗、木匙。在河边，我看到他们的独木船。在有些用苇子遮着的荫棚下，我看到有些妇女仍然用着那由两个木叉和三片木板构成的织布机在织布。然而我也注意到他们生活中已经出现了瓷茶壶、瓷碗和铁皮桶。他们爱喝茶，可是过去没有人知道一块茶到底要多少钱，现在他们大人小孩都喝茶。再没有人去理会那些为他们过去生活里一日不能缺少的打火石了，现在大家都用火柴；一匣火柴有十包，才要五角钱。我说：“你们还养鸡！”阿西木说：“这也是这两年的事。从前，要是你养鸡，那是你自己招乡保长来麻烦。而且从前我们人还没吃的，拿什么来养鸡啊！”
    这个小村子过去从来没有小学，从一九五四年秋天起，村里也有了小学了。阿西木谈到这个问题时说：“解放以后，村里群众都要求办一个小学。时代不同了，不识字就等于瞎子。不仅不能读报，甚至上面来的文件也看不懂。在这样一个戈壁滩上，要是没有人识字，上面来了文件又到哪儿去找人来读啊。一九五三年十一月，我们这儿进行了普选，我们选出了我们自己的代表，后来我们就把这个问题向县人民代表大会提出。一九五四年秋天，我们这个村上就有了小学。这使大家格外感到人民有了自己的政权的好处。”
    村子里有好些人都聚拢到我们那一间小屋子里来，安静地并津津有味地旁听着我们的谈话。后来我看到一个有着很长的白胡须的老年人（后来我才知道他的名字叫贾马利），由一个七八岁的孩子扶着，一步一步摸索到我们屋子里来。看样子好像他要和我谈什么似的。大家帮着招呼他从人丛里走过来。他的眼睛没有瞎，然而他眼珠子里发出来的光，就像一个瞎子那样不集中在任何地方。他仿佛是在凝视我，但是也没有什么特殊的表情。他有些颤动。他说话也仿佛很困难似的。他说：“过去乡保长来，骑大马，拿着鞭，见人先抽几鞭再说，要把我们抓到别的地方去作苦工。现在，再没有打我们的人了。我听说毛主席派了人来问我们好。我看不到毛主席，我要来看看毛主席派来的人。我没有什么话要说，我只是要向毛主席道谢。”他这样说时，忽然一下子扑到地上叩起头来。他那严肃的、诚恳的、老态龙钟的表情，强烈地感动了我。他那突然的动作一下子使我紧张到极点。我立刻肃穆地跪下来回拜他，亲切地并带着一种晚辈的心情把他扶起来。屋子里所有的人这时也都立了起来。这一带人民在旧时代里所遭遇的侮辱、灾难和苦楚、以及解放以后对党对毛主席从心底里激发出来的纯朴的恳挚的感激，都在这个肃静的、感人的、没有言语可以表达的场合中透彻地表达出来了。
