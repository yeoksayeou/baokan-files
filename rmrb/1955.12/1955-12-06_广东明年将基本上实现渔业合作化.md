    Guangdong Province recently formulated a new plan for the cooperativization of marine fishery production, requiring that before the autumn fishing season next year, the number of fishery production cooperatives in the province be increased from the existing 267 to more than 2,300, with the number of fishing households joining the cooperatives reaching 80% of the total number of fishing households. After the implementation of this plan, the time for the basic cooperativization of fishery production in the province will be more than a year ahead of the plan previously drawn up by Guangdong Province.
    Fishermen in the South China Sea often encounter dangerous winds and waves in production, so they have always had the habit of mutual assistance and cooperation. Since liberation, many mutual aid and cooperative organizations and fishery production cooperatives have been established. These fishery production cooperatives uniformly use and allocate labor, tools and funds, and carry out diversified operations, resulting in significant increases in production. The Yanan Fishery Production Cooperative in Xinhui County increased the number of trawling fishing boats by two, and expanded the original three types of operations to six. During the off-season production period from May to July this year, production increased by 90% compared with the same period last year. The 22 fishery production cooperatives in the eastern Guangdong region increased production by 30% to 40% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. The vast number of fishermen have seen the superiority of the cooperatives, and more and more people are requesting to join. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东明年将基本上实现渔业合作化
    中共广东省委员会最近制定了新的海洋渔业生产合作化规划，要求在明年秋汛前，全省渔业生产合作社由现有二百六十七个发展到二千三百多个，入社渔户达到总渔户的百分之八十。这个计划实现后，全省渔业生产基本合作化的时间将比广东省过去拟订的计划提前一年多。
    南海渔民在生产中经常遇到惊险的风浪，因此一向有互助合作的习惯。解放以来已经建立了许多互助合作组织和渔业生产合作社。这些渔业生产合作社统一地使用和调配劳动力、工具和资金，开展多种作业，因而都显著地增产。新会县崖南渔业生产合作社因为增加两艘拖网作业渔船，并且把原来三种作业扩大至六种作业，今年五月到七月的淡季生产期内就比去年同期增产百分之九十。粤东区二十二个渔业生产合作社，今年第一季比去年同期增产了百分之三十到四十。广大渔民看到了合作社的优越性，要求入社的人越来越多。（新华社）
