    Strive to Fulfill and Overfulfill the 1955 Plan
    Overcoming Conservative Thinking to Comprehensively Fulfill the National Plan
    Chen Zhongxiang

    In the second half of the year, the Shenyang Smelting Plant achieved great results in the production increase and economy practice movement: many long-unattainable technical and economic norms were broken, the cost overruns of the first half of the year were reversed, and conditions for comprehensively fulfilling the 1955 national plan were in place. This fact shows that the potential of existing industrial enterprises is great; any conservative and complacent thinking is unfounded.

    In the first half of this year, although the Shenyang Smelting Plant overfulfilled its production plan, costs exceeded the budget by 1.2 million yuan, and the profit plan remitted to the state was only slightly above 81 percent. The main reason for this situation was that the plant's important technical and economic norms, such as lead reflection recovery rate, copper smelting block rate, metal recovery rate, and electricity consumption, did not meet the targets. Failure to meet the planned targets for copper and lead metal recovery alone resulted in a cost overrun of 460,000 yuan.

    Failure to complete the national targets for key technical and economic norms is a long-standing problem at the Shenyang Smelting Plant. The factory's leading staff members have long been aware of this situation. They have held meetings more than once to study these problems, and some leading staff members have also made relatively deep self-criticisms. The leadership has also called on all employees and technicians to break through the key problems in production. However, because some leading staff members were satisfied with the achievements of the past few years, satisfied with overfulfilling the gross output value plan, did not actively support the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers and technicians, and did not implement the suggestions made by Soviet experts, the problem has never been resolved. For example, during the discussion of the national plan in February this year, the workers in the lead reflection section of the lead electrolysis workshop set a plan to achieve a lead reflection recovery rate of 90 percent. This plan was based on the "adding iron filings" suggestion made by Soviet experts, and was therefore relatively advanced and practical. However, Li Guang, a member of the Party committee, deputy director, and chief engineer, considered it "too rash" and lowered it to 88 percent. The Soviet experts' suggestion was also not implemented. Li Guang believed that completing the output plan was the biggest saving, as for the recovery rate, "We only have this much ability, what can we do if we can't complete the national plan target!"

    In June this year, the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry required the Shenyang Smelting Plant to remit an additional 2.31 million yuan in profit to the state on the basis of the original plan, of which 2 million yuan should be completed by reducing costs. At this time, the complacency and conservatism of some people, led by Li Guang, became even more prominent. When formulating the production increase and economy practice plan, they emphasized "seeking truth from facts," "digging as much as you can," and not being "forced or rash." Other leading staff members also openly said: "The reason why these technical and economic norms have not been completed for a long time is because the norms were set too high in the past few years, and then could not be lowered, resulting in carrying a burden for two or three years." At the Party committee meeting, Li Guang suggested: "Report our situation to the bureau and ask the bureau to give us another target."

    In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan and the task of increasing production and practicing economy, the Party organization of the Shenyang Smelting Plant carried out arduous political and ideological work. The Party committee first organized all Party members to study and discuss the documents of the Party congresses at all levels, and to study Comrade Li Fuchun's report on "Practicing Strict Economy and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction." According to the spirit of the documents, they launched a struggle against the complacency and conservatism of Li Guang and others, and further specifically analyzed the reasons why the financial cost plan for the first half of the year was not completed according to the actual situation of the factory. This analysis showed that the reason why the financial cost plan for the first half of the year was not completed was mainly due to serious losses and waste. In addition to the failure to complete two-thirds of the major technical and economic norms, the consumption quota exceeded the budget by more than 100,000 yuan. The overspending of non-production expenses was also very serious. Low-priced materials that could be substituted were also not used. The Party committee further organized the staff of the departments and workshops to use the method of detailed accounting to propose a preliminary production increase and economy practice plan based on the waste found and the possible degree to which some important technical and economic norms could be achieved, which could save about 2.8 million yuan. This figure was still far from meeting the requirements of the higher authorities; but it powerfully demonstrated that the enterprise had potential, and it was great. As long as we further rely on and mobilize all employees and technicians, it is entirely possible to complete this arduous task.

    In accordance with the instructions of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, the Party committee, with the convening of a factory-wide Party member congress as the center in the Party, and through a series of economic activity analysis meetings among the workers, launched a mass criticism and self-criticism movement from the bottom up, exposing the long-standing tendency of formalism in the technical and organizational measures plan, criticizing the leadership for not paying attention to the suggestions of Soviet experts, not organizing the promotion of advanced experience, and not promptly handling the rationalization proposals of the workers. As a result, some leading staff members began to change their work style.

    On the basis of ideological criticism, the administrative leadership of the smelting plant revised the technical and organizational measures plan, promoted the team-based economic accounting system more widely throughout the plant, rationally improved the reward system, and widely carried out labor competitions between workshops and workshops, work sections and work sections, furnaces and furnaces, posts and posts, and individuals and individuals. In the labor competition, they generally used production meetings, technical research meetings, and other forms to organize the broad masses of workers and technicians to break through key issues. After clarifying the six key problems of casting mold recovery rate, water-soluble zinc, etc., the zinc electrolysis workshop immediately organized forces to solve them. Before October, all six "old key issues" had been broken through. Because the leading staff members and technicians of the entire plant changed their work style, went deep into reality, and strengthened specific leadership, the "old key issues" such as the lead reflection furnace recovery rate were also broken through. Li Guang, deputy director and chief engineer, also went deep into the front line to help workers analyze the scientific basis and feasibility of "adding iron filings," and encouraged and supported workers and workshop technicians to conduct experiments, which resulted in increasing the lead reflection recovery rate to more than 92 percent (the national plan was 88 percent, and the actual was 84 to 85 percent). Ren Jieren, a technician from the copper smelting workshop, went deep into the smelting section with the workers on shifts, and used the Kovalev work method to summarize a set of advanced operation methods. After promotion, it also enabled the copper smelting block rate of the copper smelting workshop, which had not reached the quota for more than two years, to reach an average of 78.77 percent (the national plan was 77 percent). The atmosphere of implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is growing. The workers say that implementing the suggestions of experts is the biggest "trick." After the lead smelting workshop implemented the Soviet experts' suggestion to recover lead first and then recover copper, it can recover more than 200 tons of lead a year.

    Because the leadership changed its work style, went deep into reality, and relied on and supported the enthusiasm of the workers and technicians, the workers' labor enthusiasm also increased. From July to the end of September, the workers of the entire plant found 781 tricks and rationalization proposals, breaking through 22 major economic and technical norms in production technology such as lead reflection recovery rate, electricity consumption, water-soluble zinc, and acid-soluble zinc, creating the highest record since the smelting plant started operation, of which the 11 norms broken through in July and August alone could save 1.4 million yuan. The third quarter settlement results not only made up for the losses in the first half of the year, but also had a surplus. The results of completing the tasks are also increasing month by month. September was the best month for completing the tasks in the third quarter, and October was even better than September. The processing costs of various products in the entire plant have generally decreased. The product quality indicators of zinc were not completed in July, but all indicators specified by the state were comprehensively overfulfilled in August, September, and October.

    The facts of the Shenyang Smelting Plant prove that the reason why many enterprises fail to complete the national plan is not because the quota is set too high, or the technical level is too low. As long as the leading staff members of these factories can overcome complacency and right-leaning conservative thinking, go deep down, and actively rely on and support the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and technicians, it is entirely possible to complete the national plan.

    努力完成和超额完成一九五五年计划
    克服保守思想，就能全面完成国家计划
    陈忠祥
    沈阳冶炼厂在下半年的增产节约运动中，取得了很大的成绩：许多长期达不到的技术经济定额被突破了，上半年成本超支的情况扭转了，全面完成一九五五年国家计划的条件有了。这个事实说明，现有工业企业的潜在能力是很大的；任何保守和自满思想都是没有根据的。
    今年上半年，沈阳冶炼厂的产量计划虽然超额完成了，但是，成本超支了一百二十万元，上缴利润计划仅完成百分之八十一强。产生这种情况的主要原因是冶炼厂的铅反射回收率、铜熔烧块率、金属回收率、电力消耗等重要技术经济定额没有达到指标。因铜、铅两项金属回收率没完成计划指标而造成成本超支就达四十六万元。
    主要的技术经济定额完不成国家指标，是沈阳冶炼厂长久以来所存在的老问题。这种情况，工厂领导工作人员早就知道。他们不止一次地开会研究这些问题，有些领导工作人员也作过比较深刻的检查。领导方面也号召过全体职工和技术人员来突破生产中的关键问题。但是，由于有些领导工作人员满足于过去几年的成就，满足于超额完成生产总值计划，不积极支持职工群众和技术人员提出的合理化建议，不贯彻执行苏联专家提出的建议，问题始终得不到解决。例如，今年二月职工讨论国家计划的时候，铅电解车间铅反射工段的工人们订出了铅反射回收率要达到百分之九十的计划。这个计划是根据苏联专家提出的“加铁屑”的建议制定的，因而是比较先进的和切合实际的。但是，党委委员、副厂长兼总工程师李光认为“太冒进”，给压低到百分之八十八。苏联专家的建议也没执行。李光认为完成产量计划就是最大的节约，至于回收率，“我们只有这一点本事，完不成国家计划指标，有什么办法啊！”
    今年六月，重工业部有色金属工业管理局要求沈阳冶炼厂在原计划的基础上，多为国家上缴二百三十一万元利润，并且其中要有二百万元从降低成本方面来完成。这时，以李光为首的一些人的自满保守思想表现得更加突出了。在制定增产节约计划的时候，他们强调“实事求是”，“能挖多少算多少”，不能“勉强和冒进”。另一些领导工作人员还公开地说：“这些技术经济定额所以长期完不成，是因为过去几年把定额订得太高，后来又不能下降，以致背了两、三年包袱。”在党委会议上，李光就建议：“把我们的情况向局里报告，请局里另给我们指标。”
    为了保证全面完成国家计划和增产节约任务，沈阳冶炼厂党组织进行了艰巨的政治思想工作。党委首先组织全体党员学习和讨论了各级党代表会议的文件，学习李富春同志关于“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告。他们根据文件精神，对李光等人的自满保守思想展开了斗争，并且按照厂内实际情况，进一步具体分析了上半年财务成本计划没有完成的原因。这个分析表明，上半年之所以未能完成财务成本计划，主要是有严重的损失浪费。除了三分之二的重大技术经济定额未完成外，消耗定额超支了十多万元。非生产支出的超支也很严重。应用低价材料代替的也没有利用。党委又进一步组织了科室和车间的工作人员用算细账的办法，根据发现的浪费情况和一些重要技术经济定额的可能达到程度，提出初步的增产节约计划，大约可以节约二百八十多万元。这个数字离完成上级的要求还差得很远；但是它有力地说明了企业的潜力是有的，并且是很大的。只要进一步依靠和发动全体职工和技术人员，完成这一艰巨的任务是完全有可能的。
    党委会按照沈阳市委的指示，在党内以召开全厂党员大会为中心，在职工中通过一系列的经济活动分析会议，展开了自下而上的群众性的批评和检查，揭发了在技术组织措施计划上长期存在的形式主义的偏向，批评了领导方面没有重视苏联专家的建议，不组织推广先进经验，不及时处理职工的合理化建议等缺点。结果，使一些领导工作人员开始转变了作风。
    在思想批判的基础上，冶炼厂行政领导方面修改了技术组织措施计划，在全厂较普遍地推行了班组经济核算制，合理地改进奖励制度，并且广泛地开展了车间和车间、工段和工段、炉和炉、岗位和岗位、个人和个人之间的劳动竞赛。在劳动竞赛中，他们普遍运用生产会议，技术研究会等形式，来组织广大职工和技术人员突破关键。锌电解车间在明确铸型回收率、水溶锌等六大关键问题后，立即组织力量加以解决。十月份以前，六项“老关键”全被突破了。由于全厂领导工作人员和技术人员改变了工作作风，深入实际、加强了具体的领导，铅反射炉回收率等“老关键”也被突破了。副厂长兼总工程师李光也深入现场，帮助工人分析了“加铁屑”的科学根据和可能性，并且鼓励和支持工人和车间技术员进行试验，结果使铅反射回收率提高到百分之九十二以上（国家计划是百分之八十八，以前实际是八十四到八十五）。铜熔炼车间技术员任杰人等深入到熔烧工段跟工人倒班，用郭瓦廖夫工作方法总结出了一套先进操作方法，推广后也使铜熔炼车间两年多以来都未达到定额的铜熔烧块率平均达到百分之七十八点七七（国家计划是七十七）。贯彻执行苏联专家建议的风气正在滋长。职工们把贯彻执行专家建议说成是最大的“窍门”，铅熔炼车间贯彻执行苏联专家先回收铅后回收铜的建议后，一年就可多回收二百多吨铅。
    由于领导上改变了作风，深入了实际，依靠和支持了工人们和技术人员的积极性，工人们的劳动热忱也愈益高涨了。从七月到九月末，全厂职工找出的窍门和提出的合理化建议就达七百八十一件，突破了铅反射回收率、电力消耗、水溶锌、酸溶锌等二十二项生产技术上的重大经济技术定额，创造冶炼厂开工以来的最高纪录，其中仅七、八月突破的十一项定额，即可以节约一百四十万元。第三季度结算结果，不但弥补了上半年的亏损，而且有了盈余。完成任务的成绩也是逐月上升。九月是第三季度完成任务最好的月份，十月份比九月份还好。全厂各种产品的加工费用普遍下降。七月份锌的产品质量指标没完成，八、九、十月都全面超额完成了国家规定的各项指标。
    沈阳冶炼厂的事实证明，许多企业所以完不成国家计划，并不是因为定额订高了，或者技术水平太低了。只要这些厂的领导工作人员能克服骄傲自满情绪和右倾保守思想，深入下去，积极依靠和支持工人群众、技术人员的积极性和创造性，国家计划是完全有可能完成的。
