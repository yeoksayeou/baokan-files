    Marching Towards the Goal of Two Thousand Jin Per Mu
    By Our Correspondent Lin Li

    In Henglan Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, there is a piece of land called "Sixty Mu." In previous years, the highest yield of this land was 490 jin of rice per mu. Since it became the land of the agricultural production cooperative, the average yield per mu in the early crop reached as high as 535 jin, and the late crop is expected to be 675 jin. Adding the two crops together, it is 1,210 jin, which is almost one and a half times higher than the highest yield in previous years.

    In Guangdong, it is no longer a novelty to harvest more than a thousand jin from one mu of land. What is noteworthy here is: Why can the yield of the same piece of land increase by more than one time in a year? What is even more noteworthy is: There are many, many more lands with similar increases in yield, with 6,000 mu in Henglan Township alone, 220,000 mu in Zhongshan County, and more than 725,000 mu in the Pearl River Delta... What is the main reason for the rapid increase in production?

    The soil here is fertile and has great potential. However, before the land reform, most of the land was concentrated in the hands of feudal landlords. Under the oppression of high rents and heavy taxes, farmers did not have the necessary means of production and funds, and could not maintain their livelihoods solely from farming. To make up for the lack of living expenses, they spent most of their time catching shrimp and fish, and for the land, they adopted the so-called "three visits a year" method. That is to say, they only went to the fields during sowing, transplanting, and harvesting. During these three visits, they adopted a simple intercropping method. That is: on the same piece of land, two different crops are planted at different times, allowing them to grow simultaneously. The specific process is: when transplanting early rice, the row spacing is left very wide; when the early rice seedlings grow to one chi five cun, that is, twenty-five days later, late rice seedlings are transplanted between the rows of early rice. In the meantime, there is no cultivation, no fertilization, and the early rice is harvested in July, and the late rice is harvested in November.

    In order to tap the potential of the land, Guangdong has called on farmers to change the intercropping system to the advanced continuous cropping system while developing agricultural cooperatives. This continuous cropping system means that after the early rice matures and is harvested, the land is plowed, harrowed, and fertilized, and then late rice seedlings are transplanted. This allows the land to be fully utilized.

    However, this reform, which seems not too difficult, cannot be accomplished by farmers under individual management. The land reform here ended only two years ago, and many farmers have not yet escaped poverty. To implement continuous cropping, at least there must be plowing cattle, farm tools, fertilizers... For farmers in the Pearl River Delta, these are not things that can be done in a short time. In addition, this area is all polder fields, with more than one hundred mu or even more than one thousand mu of land in one polder. To reform farming techniques on such a large area of land, the fields in one polder must be changed together, in large areas. Individual farmers cannot make the change even if they have funds, let alone without funds. Because the water conservancy in the polder is unified management, there cannot be two different farming methods in one polder. Obviously, to abolish the backward intercropping system and promote the advanced continuous cropping system, there must be state economic support and reliance on agricultural cooperatives. It is for this reason that the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee decided to realize cooperativization in this area in advance. And a large amount of agricultural loans, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, etc., are first used to meet the needs here. After Henglan Township received state economic support and organized agricultural cooperatives, it first converted more than 6,000 mu of the 19,000 mu of land cultivated by intercropping in the township into continuous cropping fields. Most of the more than 1,250 mu of rice fields in the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative were also reformed into continuous cropping fields, thereby guaranteeing increased production.

    There is a proverb in this area, called "A thousand urns, ten thousand urns, cannot compare to mud urns." It means that the silt in the mud ponds and ditches is more effective than any fertilizer. While reforming farming techniques, the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative also mobilized a large number of members to dig mud. At one time, the cooperative mobilized forty-five small boats, two large boats, and more than two hundred laborers to dig mud, totaling 450,000 jin, and filled the silt for 400 mu of continuous cropping land. In the past, the land in this area was not winter-plowed, only "滑一滑" (glided over) with a hoe-like tool. Since the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the farmers have plowing cattle and have carried out winter plowing. At the same time, under the leadership of the government, close planting of small clusters was promoted, and improved rice varieties - Nantex 16 were selected. Because of this series of reforms, their production exceeded the expectations of many people. According to the director of the cooperative, during the early stage of the establishment of the cooperative, when evaluating the land, the members wanted to evaluate their yields as high as possible, so that they could distribute more grain in the future. After evaluating, the entire cooperative's land was evaluated at 410,000 jin; but this year's actual yield can be 780,000 jin, which is more than 90% higher than the original evaluation.

    In the past, farmers adopted the backward intercropping system, in addition to artificial exploitation, there was another reason, that is, intercropping can just avoid the harm of the "three-spotted stem borer." Therefore, whether or not the stem borer can be defeated is not only related to whether or not production can be increased, but also a key to whether the technological reform can be successful and whether the agricultural cooperative can be consolidated.

    This year, Henglan Township encountered a major insect plague. According to farmers, this year's insect plague is the largest in recent decades. The "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in this township had fifteen mu of seedling fields, because there were too many stem borers, the members used the determination to sacrifice all the seedlings and flushed them with water. This flush alone flushed out more than seventy jin of small insects. In the beginning, people organized to go to the fields to kill the insects, but just after killing the first generation, the second generation followed closely behind. And each generation was more than the previous one. People used insecticide powder, 666, but these insecticides could only kill the stem borers on the surface and could not extinguish the stem borers hiding in the rice stems. People used local methods, combining garlic, tobacco bone water with kerosene, and caustic soda to kill insects, but it was also ineffective. An agricultural cooperative in Henglan Township thought of more than seventy ways to kill insects, but the stem borers were still so rampant.

    In the face of the serious threat of stem borers, the county and district staff went to catch insects with the masses during the day, and went to "light lamps" with the masses at night - to lure moths into the water. A county staff member, in order to find a way to kill stem borers, studied the birth, harm, pupation, transformation into moths and laying of eggs of stem borers, studied the life and reproduction patterns of stem borers, knew that one stem borer could eat five rice stalks to death, and knew that stem borers laid their eggs from 9 pm to 12 am every day... But before he could think of a way to kill stem borers, he got encephalitis and fell ill... At this time, other staff members also turned pale and their eye sockets were sunken due to overwork. Among the farmers, some people were disappointed, and they said with drooping heads: "The heavens will not let us eat, nothing will work." Those hostile class elements and people with ulterior motives took the opportunity to spread rumors and make troubles. They attributed the stem borer disaster to the reform of the farming system, saying that the stem borer disaster was brought about by the agricultural cooperative...

    At this critical juncture, Fang Guangrong, the head of Henglan District, suddenly remembered that he had heard someone say somewhere that "666", fertilizer powder, and dry mud powder could be used to kill stem borers. So, he found Huang Changrong, the director of the "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative, and found the staff of the county agricultural technology promotion station and the supply and marketing cooperative to discuss together. According to his vague memory, they formulated a new insecticide powder and immediately tested it in the rice fields. A few days later, the insects died, and even the insects that had burrowed into the rice stems were killed. The withered yellow leaves turned green, and the farmers who had been drooping their heads began to smile again.

    After this insect elimination struggle, although Henglan Township did not complete the planned production increase for early rice, they found a method to eliminate insects, eliminated pests, and guaranteed a bumper harvest of late rice. This victory prepared favorable conditions for the great development of agricultural cooperatives and the reform of agricultural technology. Therefore, after the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were published, a new upsurge of agricultural cooperativization immediately appeared in Henglan Township. The number of agricultural cooperatives quickly developed from the original six to fourteen, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased from the original 591 to 946. Together with the original three mutual aid groups, 94% of the people in the township participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. At the same time, the township decided to convert all intercropping fields into continuous cropping fields within the next two to three years.

    The victory in the insect elimination struggle also strengthened people's confidence in increasing production. According to Ling Zhikun, a technician at the technology promotion station, when the land reform had just ended, a Soviet agronomist came to Henglan Township. At that time, the agronomist was very excited and very sorry after seeing the land in this area. Because this is the alluvial area of the Pearl River Delta, the soil is very fertile, and each mu of land should produce at least 2,000 jin of grain, but at that time it only produced about 300 jin per mu. When the agricultural cooperative was first established, the county and district staff put forward the goal of striving for "1,000 jin per mu" and "1,000 jin per cooperative." However, even this "1,000 jin per mu" and "1,000 jin per cooperative" encountered resistance and opposition from many people. They said: The Communist Party is really good at exaggerating. They also said: If you add rice and straw together, you may be able to harvest 1,000 jin. In order to prove that the "1,000 jin per mu" was not realistic, they also cited several ancient precepts and proverbs, saying that the highest ideal of farmers is to be able to harvest 500 jin per mu. But the facts of this year completely destroyed these conservative ideas. Now, the farmers no longer argue about whether the "1,000 jin per mu" and "1,000 jin per cooperative" are possible, but are full of confidence and are moving towards the goal of 2,000 jin per mu.

    朝着每亩两千斤的目标走
    本报记者　林里
    广东省中山县横栏乡有一块土地，叫“六十亩”。这块地往年的最高产量是每亩四百九十斤稻谷。自从变成农业生产合作社的土地后，上造每亩平均产量高达五百三十五斤，晚造预计六百七十五斤。两造加在一起是一千二百一十斤。比往年的最高产量几乎高出一倍半。
    在广东，一亩土地收个千多斤，早已不是什么新事了。这里值得注意的是：为什么同一块土地，一年就能增产一倍多？更值得注意的是：类似这样的增产一倍的土地还有很多很多，单是横栏乡就有六千亩，中山县全县是二十二万亩，珠江三角洲地方是七十二万五千多亩……生产量能够迅速提高的主要原因是什么呢？
    这里的土地很肥，潜力很大。但是在土地改革以前，大部分土地集中在封建地主手里。农民们在高租重税的压榨下，没有必要的生产工具和资金，单靠种地的收入不能维持生活。为了弥补生活费用的不足，他们就把大部分时间用来捉虾捕鱼，而对于土地，便采用了所谓“一年三下地”的方法。就是说，只是在播种、插秧、收割的时候，才到地里去。在这三次下地的时候，又采用了简陋的间作方法。这就是：在同一块土地上，分别不同时间，种植两种不同的谷物，让它们同时生长。它的具体过程是：在早稻插秧的时候，把行距留得很宽；等到早稻秧苗长到一尺五寸，也就是二十五天以后，再在早稻的行距之间，插上晚稻的秧苗。在这中间，不中耕，不施肥，等到七月收早稻，等到十一月间收晚禾。
    为了发挥土地的潜在能力，广东各地在发展农业合作社的同时，就号召农民把间作制改为先进的连作制。这种连作制，就是等早稻成熟收割完毕，把土地翻耕、犁耙，加上肥料以后，再插晚稻秧苗，这就可以使土地得到充分的利用。
    但是，这项看来并不太难的改革，不是个体经营条件下的农民所能胜任的。这里的土地改革，结束不过二年，许多农民还没有摆脱贫困的处境。实行连作制，起码要有耕牛、农具、肥料……这些，对于珠江三角洲的农民来说，都不是一时能做到的。另外，这里都是围田，一个围内都有百多亩，乃至千多亩的土地。要在这大面积的土地上改革耕作技术，就必须一个围里的田一齐改，大片大片地改。单干农民别说没有资金，就是有了资金也改不成。因为围内的水利是统一管理的，一个围内不能有两种不同的耕作方法。显然，要废除落后的间作制，推行先进的连作制，必须有国家的经济支援和依靠农业合作社。就是因为这个缘故，中共广东省委会和省人民委员会决定在这一带提前实现合作化。并且把大量的农业贷款、农药机械、化学肥料等，首先满足这里的需要。横栏乡在得到了国家的经济支援，又组织起农业合作社以后，就把全乡用间作制耕作的一万九千多亩土地中的六千多亩，首先改为连作田。三联农业合作社的一千二百五十多亩稻田，也大部分改革成了连作田，从而保证了增产。
    这一带有一句农谚，叫做“千瓮万瓮，唔比泥瓮”。意思是说，泥塘和沟渠里的淤泥，比什么肥料都有效。三联农业合作社在改革耕作技术的同时，也动员了大批社员去挖泥。有个时期，这个社曾动员了四十五只小艇，两只大艇和二百多个人工去挖泥，总共挖了四十五万斤，给四百亩连作地加填了淤泥。从前，这一带的土地都不进行冬耕，只用类似锄头的“?”滑一滑。自从有了农业合作社以后，农民们有了耕牛，进行了冬耕。同时，在政府领导下推行了小科密植，选用了优良稻种——南特十六号。因为有了这一连串的改革，他们的生产量就超出了许多人的预料之外。据社长谈，在建社初期，进行土地评产的时候，社员们都想把自己的产量评高点，好在将来分粮的时候多分一点。评来评去，全社土地评了四十一万斤；但是今年实际可产七十八万斤，高出原评数的百分之九十以上。
    过去，农民们采用落后的间作制，除了人为的压榨以外，还有另外一个道理，那就是间作恰恰可以避开“三化螟”的为害。因此，能不能战胜螟害，不仅关系到能不能增产，而且是技术改革能否成功，农业合作社能不能巩固的关键之一。
    今年，横栏乡遇上了大虫灾。据农民谈，今年的虫灾之大，是近几十年间所没有的。这个乡的“八一”农业合作社，有十五亩秧田，因为螟虫太多，社员们用牺牲全部秧苗的决心，用水冲了一下。单是这一冲，就冲出了七十多斤小虫。开始，人们组织起来，到田里去打，但是刚刚打完第一代，第二代就紧跟着出世了。而且一代比一代多。人们用杀虫粉，用六六六，可是这些杀虫药剂，只能杀死表面的螟虫，扑不灭藏在稻棵茎内的螟虫。人们按照土法子，把大蒜，烟骨水合上煤油、烧碱去杀虫，但是也没有效力。横栏乡有一个农业合作社，前后想了七十多种灭虫方法，但是螟虫还是那么猖狂。
    在螟虫的严重威胁前面，县、区的工作人员，白天跟群众一起去捉虫，夜晚跟群众一起去“点灯”——诱蛾入水。有一位县工作人员，为了寻找杀螟虫的方法，研究了螟虫的出生、为害、成蛹、变蛾和下卵，研究了螟虫的生活规律和繁殖规律，知道了一条螟虫可以吃死五根稻禾，知道了螟虫的产卵是在每天夜晚九时到十二时……但是没有等到想出杀螟虫的办法，他得了脑炎，病倒了……这时候，其他工作人员们也因为劳累过度，脸色变青了，眼窝塌陷了。在农民中间，一些人失望了，他们垂头丧气地说着：“老天爷不叫吃饭，说什么也不中。”那些敌对阶级分子和别有用心的人，就乘机造谣生事，他们把螟虫的灾害归结到改革耕作制上面，说螟虫的祸害是农业合作社招引来的……
    就在这个严重的关头，横栏区区长方光容，忽然想起他曾在某地听人说过用“六六六”、肥田粉，合上干泥粉可以杀螟虫的事。于是，他找到“八一”农业合作社的社长黄昌荣，找到县农业技术推广站和供销合作社的工作人员共同商量，他们按照他的模糊记忆，配制了一种新的杀虫粉，并且立刻在稻田里试用。几天过后，虫子死掉了，连钻到稻茎内部的虫子也被杀死了。枯黄了的叶子发青了，垂头丧气的农民又开始微笑了。
    经过这场除虫斗争，横栏乡的早稻虽然没有完成预定的增产计划，但是他们找到了除虫的方法，消灭了害虫，保证了晚稻的丰收。这次胜利给农业合作社的大发展和农业技术的改革准备了有利条件。所以，在党中央七届六中全会（扩大）会议的文件公布以后，横栏乡立刻出现了农业合作化的新高潮，农业合作社由原来的六个迅速发展到了十四个，入社农户由原来的五百九十一户增加到九百四十六户。加上原有的三个互助组，全乡就有百分之九十四的人，参加了互助合作组织。同时，全乡决定在今后两三年内，把所有的间作田，改成连作田。
    除虫斗争的胜利，也坚定了人们增产的信心。据技术推广站的技术员凌志坤谈，在土地改革刚刚结束的时候，有一位苏联农学家来过横栏乡，当时，农学家看了这一带的土地，非常兴奋，也非常惋惜。因为这里是珠江三角洲的冲积地区，土地非常肥沃，每亩田至少应该产粮二千斤，但是那时每亩只产三百斤左右。在农业合作社刚成立的时候，县区工作人员提出了争取“千斤亩”和“千斤社”。然而就是这个“千斤亩”和“千斤社”，也遭到了不少人的抵抗和反对。他们说：共产党真会放大炮。又说：要把稻谷稻草加在一起，也许能够收获
  一千斤。为了证明“千斤亩”的不能现实，还引证了若干古训和农谚，说每亩能够收获五百斤，就是农民的最高理想。可是今年一年的事实，完全摧毁了这些保守思想。现在，农民们已经不再争论“千斤亩”和“千斤社”是否可能的问题，而是满怀信心地朝着每亩二千斤的目标走了。
