American Newspaper Commentary on the Four Foreign Ministers Conference
Qin Benli

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference did not achieve the results people had hoped for. This makes people understand that every step forward on the road to easing international tensions will encounter obstruction from international reactionary forces. The outcome of this conference also shows that although the conference did not reach any major agreements, it did not fulfill the wishes of those who have long sought to worsen the international situation. The "Geneva spirit" remains the mainstream of the current development of the international situation. Now, let's take a look at the American newspaper commentary on the outcome of this conference, which may not be without benefit.

Some American newspapers admit that the reason why the conference did not reach an agreement was precisely the result of the United States obstructing it according to its pre-planned agenda. On November 17, the "Christian Science Monitor" article by Hashi said, "The result of this conference is exactly what Secretary of State Dulles planned. Dulles planned to ensure that the conference would not achieve any success."

To achieve this plan, Dulles had a special set of tactics. Take the Western countries' proposals on resolving the German issue as an example. According to the American "Stone Weekly," this proposal considered "world issues from a military perspective" and was "attracted to" the rearmament of Germany, with the aim of putting "German soldiers into the ranks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Therefore, the weekly asked reasonably, "We only need to stop and ask ourselves one question to see how ridiculous our attitude is. If Russia's conditions allowed Germany to join the Warsaw Pact to oppose us, would we agree to the reunification of Germany?" The "New York Times" commentary on November 17 also revealed that even Western figures, including the West German Social Democratic Party, "lamented" that this plan was impossible to negotiate and even "hypocritical." Therefore, a secret had long been circulating among Western diplomatic officials in Geneva: all local Western diplomats knew in advance that the proposal would be rejected.

To reject the Soviet Union's practical and feasible proposals for resolving the German issue, which are in the interests of all European countries; but to put forward proposals that even oneself knows will not be accepted by the other party and yet expect the other party to accept them, what exactly is the intention?

Regarding this issue, the American newspaper commentary provided the following answer: Dulles wanted to block further easing of the international situation by not allowing the conference to reach an agreement. According to Allen's article in the "New York Post" on November 21, due to the failure of this conference, Dulles raised "the serious question of whether negotiations with the Soviet Union are possible," attempting to use the failure of this conference to create tension and pull countries back into the "Cold War."

Therefore, after the conference ended, some American newspapers launched another propaganda campaign to bury the "Geneva spirit"; this, like their blatant dissemination of pessimism about the conference on the eve of the meeting, was no accident. Now they clamor, "The Geneva spirit is dead," "The Cold War is revived," "The policy of strength will be restored to its primary position," and so on. The influential "New York Times" said in an editorial that because the conference had accomplished nothing, "the 'Geneva spirit,' which promised new hope for the world, has vanished, and the recent great power agreement embodied in the original Geneva instructions has been thrown into the dustbin of history."

Some American officials also do not conceal their joy over the failure of this conference. They believe that this will alleviate the difficulties that the United States has encountered at home and abroad due to the easing of the situation. A United Press dispatch said, "Some government officials believe that the failure of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference may seem bad on the surface, but it is actually a good thing because it will stop the spiritual 'disarmament' of the American public that began after the Four Power Summit in July this year" because "the Geneva spirit is deceiving the American public into producing a false sense of security." Another United Press dispatch said that American diplomats hoped that the outcome of this conference "will renew the close unity of the allies to compensate for some of the changes and rifts that have occurred in the past year."

It seems that Dulles has succeeded. However, the very fact that the United States is so afraid of reaching an agreement on the issues under discussion and so afraid of the further development of the "Geneva spirit" cannot be regarded as a manifestation of American confidence in its own cause. It is worth noting that many American newspapers, after calmly analyzing the current situation, cannot but reach the conclusion that Dulles has not achieved any "victory." For example, "New York Post" reporter Fredin said: "This conference is another failure for us, another setback in Dulles's continuous record of failures."

People see that although Dulles has obstructed the conference from reaching an agreement, he has not achieved his desire to intensify international tensions.

The "Washington Star" commented on the outcome of the conference, saying, "The experience of November frustrated the hopes generated in July. But we should not underestimate the power originating from mankind's deepest desires, which will work for East-West reconciliation, not against it." During the conference itself, the voices of the people of all countries calling for further easing of the international situation not only did not weaken but became even louder. Precisely for this reason, although no agreement was reached on the various issues discussed at the conference, the proceedings of the conference and the published communiqués proved that there are still realistic ways to resolve outstanding international issues through consultation.

The "New York Post" said in an article that the idea that the international situation would be aggravated by the failure of this conference "is of course nonsense. We admit that things have become more complicated. But it would be foolish to think that we have returned to the simpler era of conflict before the Geneva Summit." The "New York Herald Tribune" also said, "There is no reason to believe that the real achievements of the previous meeting (the Four Power Summit) have changed," "If the outstanding issues prove that they cannot be resolved through negotiations at present, there is at least no evidence that there is a trend to resolve these issues through war."

The outcome of the conference once again proved that Dulles's attempt to force others to accept his "policy of strength" is fundamentally unworkable. The path that Dulles is taking will become narrower and narrower. American political commentator Warburg recently commented on this point: "Dulles's broadcast speech on the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference (the November 18 speech) proves that our military containment policy has reached a dead end. The conditions that gave us hope that this policy could succeed no longer exist. ... Since the advent of the hydrogen bomb, strength has lost its role as an instrument of national policy. It is foolish to believe that only military strength can maintain the status quo and change the status quo to our advantage. Yet we are currently doing this foolish thing in Europe."

Now, many American commentators are also revealing a sense of unease. Because Dulles's approach is difficult to win people's sympathy, the United States will become increasingly isolated in international affairs in the future. For example, regarding the German issue, the American "Newsweek," published on November 21, expressed "serious concern" about the situation in West Germany. It said that West Germany "has a strong call for a new attitude towards Russia and a re-examination of Bonn's military obligations to the West. These calls are made by Social Democrats and even some members of the coalition government." It is concerned that West Germany "may handle everything independently and negotiate directly with the Communist East."

The above situation has caused bewilderment and unease among American newspapers.

"New York Post" reporter Fredin made a general assessment of Dulles's approach at the Geneva Conference. He said, "We have not formulated any practical policies" to meet the needs of the current situation,
"We are still struggling to move forward within the scope of the Cold War, improving some things here or groping around there..." Therefore, he proposed that "the issue of re-evaluating American foreign policy has been placed on the agenda."

The matter is so clear that Dulles's obstruction of this conference from reaching an agreement can only show that those reactionary international forces are afraid of the further easing of international tensions; but under the strong pressure of the world's peace forces, that attempt to intensify the situation has been and will continue to be defeated. Peace-loving people understand that greater efforts will be made to overcome the obstacles on the road to further easing international tensions.

    美国报刊关于四国外长会议的评论
    钦本立
    四国外长会议没有得到人们所期望的结果。这使人们懂得在为缓和国际紧张局势的道路上每前进一步，都会碰到国际反动势力的阻挠。这次会议的结果也说明，尽管会议没有达成任何重大的协议，但是，也没有使那些很久以来就在设法恶化国际局势的人达到愿望。“日内瓦精神”仍然是当前国际局势发展的主流。现在，我们来看看美国报刊关于这次会议结果的评论，或许不是没有益处的。
    一些美国报刊承认，这次会议之所以没有取得协议，正是美国按照预订计划进行阻挠的结果。十一月十七日“基督教科学箴言报”哈希的文章就说，“这次会议的结果，正是国务卿杜勒斯所计划的。杜勒斯所计划的就是要无论如何不使这次会议取得成就。”
    为了实现这个计划，杜勒斯有一套特殊的策略。举西方国家关于解决德国问题的建议为例。按照美国“斯通周刊”的说法，这个建议是从“军事方面着眼来考虑世界问题”的，并且是被德国重新武装“所吸引住”的，目的是要把“德国兵列入北大西洋公约组织的队伍”，于是这家周刊不无道理地问道，“我们只要停下来问我们自己一个问题就可以看出我们的态度多么可笑，如果俄国的条件容许德国参加华沙条约来反对我们，我们会同意德国重新统一吗？”十一月十七日“纽约时报”的评论还透露，西方国家这个计划包括西德社会党在内的西方国家人士也“慨叹”是不可能谈判的，并且甚至是“伪善”的，因此，在日内瓦西方国家外交官员中早就流传着这样一个秘密：所有当地的西方国家外交官事先都知道这个建议会遭到拒绝。
    对于苏联提出的符合所有欧洲国家利益而又切实可行的关于解决德国问题的建议，加以拒绝；但却提出连自己也知道不会被对方接受的建议而又要对方接受，这究竟是什么打算呢？
    关于这个问题，美国报纸的评论提供了这样的答案：杜勒斯想用不使会议达成协议的办法来阻挡国际局势的进一步缓和。根据十一月二十一日“纽约邮报”艾伦的文章的说法，由于这次会议的没有结果，杜勒斯就提出了同苏联谈判“是不是可能这个严重的问题”，企图利用这次会议的没有结果制造紧张局势，把各国拉回到“冷战”中去。
    因此，会议结束之后，美国一些报刊又掀起了一次埋葬“日内瓦精神”的宣传运动；这和会议前夕，它们公然对会议散播悲观空气一样，都不是偶然的。现在它们叫嚷，“日内瓦精神死了”，“冷战再起”，“实力政策将恢复到首要地位”等等。有影响的“纽约时报”在一篇社论中说，由于这次会议一事无成，“为世界许下新希望的‘日内瓦精神’已经烟消云散，而原来的日内瓦指示所体现的最近这次大国协议已经被扔到历史垃圾箱里去。”
    美国某些官员也并不掩饰他们对于这次会议的没有结果的高兴，他们认为，这将可以减轻美国由于局势缓和在国内、外所遭到的困难。合众社的一个电讯说，“某些政府官员认为日内瓦外长会议的失败也许在表面上看来不好，而实际上是很好的幸事，因为它将停止自今年七月四大国首脑会议后开始出现的美国公众的精神上的‘解除武装’”，因为“日内瓦精神正在哄骗美国公众使他们产生虚假的安全感”。合众社的另一个电讯说，美国外交官希望这次会议结果“将从新使盟国更加紧密地团结起来以弥补过去一年中所发生的某些转变和裂痕”。
    看来，杜勒斯好像是成功了。但是，美国如此害怕就讨论的问题达成协议，如此害怕“日内瓦精神”获得进一步的发展，这一事实的本身，决不能认为是美国对自己的事业有信心的表现。值得注意的是，美国不少报刊在冷静地分析一下当前的局势以后，不能不得出这样的结论：杜勒斯并没有获得什么“胜利”。例如，“纽约邮报”记者弗雷丁说：“这次会议是我们的又一次失败，是杜勒斯的连续不断的失败纪录中的又一次挫败。”
    人们看到杜勒斯虽然阻挠了会议取得协议，但是，并没有达到他企图加剧国际紧张局势的愿望。
    “华盛顿明星报”评论这次会议的结果说，“十一月的经历挫折了在七月产生的希望。但是，我们不应该低估起源于人类最深切的愿望的力量，它将为东西方和解而努力，而不是反对东西方的和解”。就在这次会议期间，各国人民要求进一步缓和国际局势的呼声不但没有削弱，反而更为高涨。正因为如此，这次会议讨论的各项问题尽管没有达成协议，但会议的进程和所发表的公报证明，目前还存在有现实的道路用协商方法来解决国际间悬而未决的问题。
    “纽约邮报”在一篇文章中说道，那种认为国际局势将因这次会议没有结果而加剧起来的说法，“当然是胡说，我们承认事情是复杂化了。但是要是认为我们又回到比较简单的日内瓦首脑会议前的冲突时期，那是愚蠢的想法”。“纽约先驱论坛报”也说，“没有任何理由认为，前次会议（四国政府首脑会议）的真正成就改变了”，“如果说悬而未决的问题结果证明目前还不能通过谈判获得解决，至少也没有证据表明有趋势要通过战争来解决这些问题。”
    会议的结果又一次证明，杜勒斯企图强使别人接受它的“实力政策”是根本行不通的。杜勒斯所走的道路将愈走愈狭。美国政论家华伯最近就这一点作了这样的评论：“杜勒斯关于日内瓦外交部长会议的广播演说（十一月十八日的演说）证明了我们的军事遏制政策在目前已经陷入了绝境。使我们对这种政策能够获得成就抱有希望的条件不再存在了。……自从氢弹出现以来，实力失去了作为国家政策工具的作用。如果认为只有军事实力才能维持现状和使现状改变得对我们有利，那是愚蠢的。然而，我们目前在欧洲做的正是这种蠢事。”
    现在，美国许多评论员还透露了不安的心情。由于杜勒斯的这种做法很难得到人们的同情，美国今后在国际事务中将愈来愈孤立。譬如在德国问题上，十一月二十一日出版的美国“新闻周刊”对西德的局势就表示了“严重担心”。它说，西德“有强烈的呼声要求对俄国采取新态度和重新审查波恩对西方的军事义务，提出这种要求的有社会民主党人和甚至联合政府内的某些成员。”它担心：西德“可能独立处理一切，直接同共产党东方进行谈判”。
    上述情况，引起了美国报刊的惶惑和不安。
    “纽约邮报”记者弗雷丁对于杜勒斯在日内瓦会议的做法作了一个概括的估计，他说，“我们还没有制定出任何实际的政策”来应付当前局势的需要，
    “我们仍然在冷战的范围内吃力地前进，在这里改善一些或在那里摸索一下……”。因而他提出“重新估计美国外交政策的问题已经提在日程上了”。
    事情是这样的清楚，杜勒斯阻挠这次会议取得协议，不能说明别的，只能说明那些反动的国际势力是害怕国际局势的进一步缓和的；但在世界和平力量强大的压力下，那种打算把局势紧张起来的企图却遭到了并且将继续遭到失败。爱好和平的人们懂得，为了克服进一步缓和国际紧张局势道路上的阻力将会作出更大的努力。
