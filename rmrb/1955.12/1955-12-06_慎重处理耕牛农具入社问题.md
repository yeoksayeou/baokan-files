Handle the Issue of Oxen and Farm Tools Entering the Cooperative Cautiously
    Lin Li

In some counties of the Yuezhong District of Guangdong Province, when dealing with the issue of oxen and large farm tools of members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, they did not differentiate between specific situations and uniformly adopted the method of valuing them and turning them over to the public, causing undue losses to the oxen. According to statistics from 2,560 cooperatives in 18 counties including Boluo and Sanshui, 2,123 cooperatives, accounting for 82.9 percent of the surveyed cooperatives, adopted the method of "valuing oxen and farm tools for cooperative ownership, and averaging out and offsetting debts." Some counties applied the method of valuing and transferring oxen and farm tools to all cooperatives.

Adopting the method of valuing and transferring oxen to the cooperative across the board, without considering the specific circumstances, first of all increased the burden on poor peasant members. In a newly established cooperative of 34 households in Luhe Township, Datang District, Sanshui County, after valuing and transferring 17 oxen to the cooperative, 18 households had to bear the cost of the oxen. Among these 18 households, one poor peasant named Li Jinjia had to bear a debt of 117 yuan. Secondly, many members who owned oxen were unwilling to transfer their oxen to the cooperative because the valuation was unreasonable or the repayment period was too long, believing that "ox-owning households are supporting non-ox-owning households." This resulted in a significant loss of oxen. Boluo County originally had 3,257 oxen. After valuing and transferring them to the cooperative, 124 died, 247 lost 20 to 30 percent of their weight, 705 were sold, and 358 were bought back. The county now has 2,786 oxen, 471 fewer than before joining the cooperative. In Pingzhou Cooperative, Fifth District, Gaoming County, out of the original 26 oxen, one died, one went blind, one became lame, one was injured, 13 had broken noses, and the rest were weaker than before joining the cooperative.

After the local Party committee discovered this serious situation, it promptly took measures to correct this deviation, and the phenomenon of oxen dying, being injured, or becoming weak was curbed. According to statistics from the Yuezhong District Party Committee, among the 2,285 cooperatives in 18 counties, 1,154 cooperatives changed and adjusted the methods of handling oxen and farm tools, accounting for more than 50 percent of the statistical number. Among them, 904 cooperatives switched to private ownership with leasing, and 250 cooperatives re-evaluated and shortened the repayment period on the basis of the original valuation for cooperative ownership. After this rectification, the masses inside and outside the cooperative expressed satisfaction.

The Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation Issues of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party clearly pointed out: "The issue of whether the members' livestock should be owned by the cooperative needs to be handled with caution. Within the first one or two years of the initial establishment of the cooperative, the economic strength and management experience are insufficient. In order to avoid excessive debt for members and loss of livestock due to poor feeding, the method of private ownership, private raising, and cooperative leasing or hiring can be adopted. After the cooperative's production has developed, the method of valuing and transferring to the cooperative can be adopted separately." Some rural workers in Boluo, Sanshui, and other counties did not follow the spirit of the Central Committee's resolution and did not carefully handle the issue of oxen entering the cooperative according to the specific situation, resulting in such a great loss. This lesson is worth remembering by rural workers in all regions.

    慎重处理耕牛农具入社问题
    林里
    广东省粤中区一些县份，在处理农业生产合作社社员的耕牛和大农具的工作中，不分别具体情况，一律采取了折价归公的办法，使耕牛遭到了不应有的损失。据博罗、三水等十八个县二千五百六十个社的统计，对耕牛、农具采取“折价归社、推平抵销”办法的有二千一百二十三个社，占统计社数的百分之八十二点九，有些县全部合作社对耕牛、农具都采用了折价归社的办法。
    不分别具体情况，对耕牛一律采用折价入社办法，这首先就加重了贫农社员的负担。三水县大塘区麓和乡新建的一个三十四户的合作社，把十七头耕牛折价入社后，就有十八户要负担耕牛款。这十八户当中有一位贫农，叫李锦佳，负担欠款一百一十七元。其次，不少有牛的社员，因为折价不合理或还款期过长，不愿意把耕牛入社，认为是“有牛户养活没牛户”。这样就造成了耕牛的大量损失。博罗县原有耕牛三千二百五十七头，折价归社后跌死一百二十四头，瘦二成至三成的有二百四十七头，卖去七百零五头，买回三百五十八头，现有耕牛二千七百八十六头，比入社前少了四百七十一头。高明县五区平州社，原有耕牛二十六头，折价归社后，死一头，瞎一头，跛脚一头，伤一头，崩鼻十三头，其余的都比入社前瘦弱了。
    当地党委发现这一严重情况以后，及时采取措施纠正了这个偏向，耕牛死伤瘦弱的现象才得到制止。据粤中区党委统计，十八个县的二千二百八十五个社当中，变更和调整了处理耕牛农具办法的有一千一百五十四个社，占统计数的百分之五十强。在这当中，改为私有租用的有九百零四个社，在原有折价归社的基础上，进行了重新评价和缩短还款期限的有二百五十个社。经过这番整顿，社内、社外群众都表示满意。
    在党的七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议中，曾明确地指出过：“处理社员的耕畜是否归社公有的问题，需要很谨慎。在合作社初办的一年或者两年以内，经济力量和管理经验都还不足，为避免社员负债过多和耕畜因喂养不善而受损失，可以采取私有私养由社租用或者雇用办法，待合作社的生产有所发展之后，再有分别地采取折价归社的办法。”博罗、三水等县的一些农村工作人员，不遵照中央决议的精神办事，不根据具体情况谨慎处理耕牛入社问题，结果遭受了这样大的损失。这个教训是值得各地农村工作人员记取的。
