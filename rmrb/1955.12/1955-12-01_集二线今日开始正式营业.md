    Jining-Erenhot Railway Line Officially Opens Today

    After being inspected and approved by the state, the Jining-Erenhot Railway will be officially taken over by the Jining Transportation Sub-bureau of the Taiyuan Railway Administration of the Ministry of Railways and will begin operations on December 1st.

    The Jining-Erenhot Railway was started in May 1953 by the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, after which a temporary management organization was established to simultaneously construct and use the railway. In addition to supplying a large quantity of construction materials and machinery for the entire line, the Jining-Erenhot Railway also undertook busy transportation tasks. From December 1953 to November this year, it has transported more than 425,000 passengers and more than 188,000 tons of various materials.

    集二线今日开始正式营业
    集二铁路经国家验收后，从十二月一日开始由铁道部太原铁路管理局集宁运输分局正式接管，并进行营业。
    集二铁路从一九五三年五月由铁道部第三工程局动工修建后，即成立了临时管理机构，一边修建，一边使用。集二铁路除了大量供应全线的建筑器材和机械设备等外，还担负了繁忙的运输任务。从一九五三年十二月到今年十一月，已经接送了旅客四十二万五千多人，运输各种物资十八万八千多吨。
