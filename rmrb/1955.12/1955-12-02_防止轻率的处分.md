It is absolutely necessary for factories and mines to impose strict punishments on those who seriously violate labor discipline and repeatedly refuse to correct their behavior in the process of rectifying and consolidating labor discipline. This is of great significance for consolidating labor discipline and ensuring the completion of national plans. However, this does not mean that the administrative leaders of enterprises can rashly punish and dismiss workers.

According to an investigation by the Anshan Federation of Trade Unions, some workers were inappropriately punished because enterprise administrative leaders made decisions based only on one-sided materials without investigation or research. For example, Liu Zhixing, a worker at the Steelmaking Company, was fired for "long-term absenteeism and selling vegetables at home." However, according to an investigation by the workers and a certificate from the village government, Liu Zhixing was indeed on sick leave at home. Chen Guixiang of the Rolling Mill was fired for "impersonating a technician," but in fact, he was hired after passing a technical examination. A staff member of the Security Section of the Metal Structure Installation Company, based solely on one-sided materials and subjective imagination, accused a worker of "intentional sabotage and strikes" and fired him. The facts were not like this. Such rash and erroneous punishments have had a very bad influence on the staff and workers.

Therefore, party and trade union organizations in enterprises should, on the one hand, support the enterprise administration in giving correct punishments to those who undermine labor discipline, and at the same time, must supervise and correct the bureaucratic work style of some enterprise leaders who rashly punish workers without investigation and research.

    防止轻率的处分
    厂矿企业在整顿和巩固劳动纪律中，对严重违反劳动纪律和屡教不改的分子给予应得的严格处分，是十分必要的，这对巩固劳动纪律、保证国家计划的完成都有很大作用。但是这并不是说企业的行政领导者，可以轻率地处分和开除工人。
    据鞍山市工会联合会的检查发现，对一部分工人的处分是不恰当的，企业行政领导者只是根据一些片面的材料，未经调查研究就作了处理。如炼钢公司工人刘志兴，以“长期旷工，在家卖菜”被开除了，但后来据工人的调查和村政府证明，刘志兴确是因病请假在家休养。轧钢公司陈贵祥以“冒充技工”被开除了，实际上他入厂是经过考工才录取的。金属结构安装公司保卫科干事，只凭片面的材料和主观的想像，就给一个工人加上“有意破坏和罢工”的罪名开除了。事实并不是这样。由于轻率的错误的处分，在职工群众中造成了很坏的影响。
    因此，企业中党和工会组织，一方面应该支持企业行政对败坏劳动纪律的人给予正确的处分，同时对某些企业领导者不经调查研究就轻率处分工人的官僚主义作风，也必须进行监督和纠正。
