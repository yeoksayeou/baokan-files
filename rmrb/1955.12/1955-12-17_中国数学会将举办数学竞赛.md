    The Chinese Mathematical Society, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, and with the consent of the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education, has decided to pilot mathematics competitions in Beijing and a few other major cities in 1956. The Chinese Mathematical Society has already established a Mathematics Competition Committee on the 11th, and elected Hua Luogeng, Fu Zhongsun, Duan Xuefu and other twelve people as members.
    Mathematics competition is an amateur academic activity. The purpose of the competition is to stimulate young students' interest in learning mathematics and improve their ability to think independently. The competition held by the Chinese Mathematical Society this time will absorb senior high school students to participate. They can first test their mathematical level according to the mathematical problems in the booklet compiled and printed by the Mathematics Competition Committee, and then participate in the school's competition, and then the school will select students to participate in the city-wide competition. The cities holding the competition will finally select a number of outstanding students from the students selected by the schools and give them the title of "Mathematics Competition Winner" and give appropriate rewards.

    中国数学会将举办数学竞赛
    中国数学会学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验，取得高等教育部和教育部的同意，决定一九五六年在北京和少数大城市重点试办数学竞赛。中国数学会已经在十一日成立数学竞赛委员会，选出华罗庚、傅种孙、段学复等十二人为委员。
    数学竞赛是一种业余的学术性活动，竞赛目的在于激发青年学生学习数学的兴趣，提高他们独立思维的能力。中国数学会这次举办的竞赛将吸收中学高年级学生参加，他们可以根据数学竞赛委员会编印的小册子中的数学题目，先测验自己的数学程度，然后参加学校的竞赛，再由学校选送参加全市性的竞赛。举办竞赛的城市最后从各学校选送的学生中选拔出若干名成绩优秀的学生给予“数学竞赛优胜者”的称号，并且给予适当的奖励。（新华社）
