    Under the Guise of Religion
    -- Crime Two of the Gong Pinmei Counter-Revolutionary Group
    Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group has consistently used the smoke screen of so-called "religious activities" to conceal their counter-revolutionary truth. But anyone can see that their actions have nothing in common with legitimate religious activities.
    The so-called "sermons" frequently conducted by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group were actually thorough counter-revolutionary propaganda. They used every vile word they could to curse the new China as a "dark world" and a "reign of sin," referring to the People's Government and the Communist Party as "devils" and "enemies," fanatically inciting believers to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government. May I ask: Today, the people of our country are enthusiastically and selflessly engaged in socialist construction, and everyone is delighted by the ever-changing face of the motherland. Why are these people so full of murderous intent towards the new China? What else is this kind of so-called "religious activity" but the most blatant counter-revolutionary agitation?
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group falsely accused the People's Government of undermining religious activities, in order to deceive those who were unaware of the truth and conceal their counter-revolutionary truth. This is completely futile. Countless facts provided by Catholics in Shanghai during this patriotic movement have proven that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has always adopted a policy of protecting religious beliefs and legitimate public religious activities; and it is precisely the Gong Pinmei group that has undermined legitimate religious activities and the lives of believers. These counter-revolutionary elements used their religious authority to violently interfere in the family and social lives of believers, preventing them from participating in any beneficial social activities. If believers wanted to participate in the Huai River project, they would say "controlling the Huai River is sinful"; student believers attending political classes at school was also a "crime" and they would tell them to skip class; farmer believers participating in agricultural production cooperatives was also "sinful". The Gong Pinmei group also preached: "God's plan dictates how much a piece of land can produce at most. If people want to change this using any method and exceed God's plan, it cannot be done.‚Äù Other activities such as believers watching movies, reading progressive books, reading newspapers, visiting the Soviet Exhibition Center, accepting state-funded benefits, participating in various mass gatherings, publishing articles in newspapers and magazines, etc., were all called "criminal" behaviors. In short, they wanted to isolate all believers from all progressive cultural life. The Gong Pinmei group even included elementary school students participating in the Young Pioneers as "sinful," and the entire family would be "excommunicated." One Catholic in the Xujiahui district, because his child wore a red scarf, was threatened by Gong Pinmei and others, causing the whole family to cry, unable to eat or sleep. Is this kind of lawless and tyrannical interference in people's basic rights also some kind of "religious activity"?
    The vast majority of Catholics in Shanghai love their country and actively participated in various patriotic movements against imperialist aggression. The Gong Pinmei group used all kinds of despicable means such as insults, attacks, and intimidation against these patriotic believers, scolding them as "lackeys of the devil," and even directing secret agents and hooligans to beat and humiliate them. Gu Pingsheng, an old Catholic in the Daturu Catholic Church, because he reported a hidden counter-revolutionary element, Zhang Xibin and Chen Zuhuan, key members of the Gong Pinmei group, illegally imprisoned Gu and verbally and physically abused him. Chen Tingliang, a Catholic in Zhennan Street, Xuhui District, because he participated in the struggle against imperialist elements within the Catholic Church, the Gong Pinmei group constantly dispatched hooligans to throw feces at his door, into his foot bath, on his clotheslines, and into his water tank. When the Gong Pinmei group was uncovered, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau found a private prison set up by the Gong Pinmei group in the Renaihui General Hospital on Chongqing South Road in Shanghai. The door frame of this prison was fitted with a seven- or eight-foot-high, three- or four-foot-wide iron gate, and the lock on the door was larger than a fist. Inside, there was also a sturdy wooden door. It was in this dark and gloomy prison that the Gong Pinmei group illegally imprisoned a nun named Shu Haiyun! Because she was dissatisfied with the arrogant behavior of Zhou Baoying, a key member of the Gong Pinmei group, she was locked in this private prison by members of the Gong Pinmei group on November 2, 1954. Are these acts of Gong Pinmei and others, who disregard the laws of the People's Republic of China, set up private prisons and tribunals, and arbitrarily trample on human rights, also some kind of "religious activity"?
    Gong Pinmei and his gang of thugs, soaked in counter-revolutionary poison, dreamed day and night of dragging the new China back to the dark ages of imperialist and Kuomintang traitor rule. In recent years, they have carried out sabotage activities in a tit-for-tat, planned, and organized manner against various social reforms of decisive significance for consolidating our people's democratic system, against various patriotic movements that demonstrated the patriotic consciousness of our people, and against other major measures of the People's Government.
    During the implementation of the land reform, at the end of November 1950, Gong Pinmei convened a meeting of nine core members, including Li Du and Zhu Xuefan, "to focus on studying how to sabotage the land reform. Regarding this issue, Gong Pinmei first slandered the land policy, saying: 'It is completely unreasonable for the poor to forcibly seize and divide the land of the landlords without contributing any sweat or blood. The Communist Party is using the method of land reform to win people's hearts. Believers should be told not to accuse the landlords at public trials and struggle meetings, and not to divide the landlords' land and property. If they are forced to receive land and property, it cannot be considered their own property, but rather held in trust for the landlords, to be returned to the landlords when the People's Government collapses,' etc. ... Gong Pinmei also said: 'Believers who receive land and property cannot sell it without the landlord's consent.' Finally, he specifically ordered that all land licenses owned by the church be photographed and preserved abroad, so that when the People's Government collapses in the future, they can be recovered based on these photos." (Quoted from Li Du's confession) Later, Gong Pinmei wrote his reactionary speech into a written regulation in Latin and distributed it in January 1951, taking advantage of the gathering of Catholic clergy from various places at the Dongjiadu Church in Shanghai for "retreat." The Gong Pinmei group not only worked with imperialist elements to photograph the land contracts of the Catholic Church and send them abroad, but also helped Liu Junliang and Liu Yengeng, local bullies and landlords in Qibao Town, Longhua District, Shanghai, to photograph the land contracts of more than 190 mu of land. After the land of these two local bullies and landlords was distributed to the peasants, Gong Pinmei immediately sent Fu Hezhou to give them 200 yuan as a sign of "condolences."
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was filled with bitter hatred for the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary elements, because they themselves were a group of people who should be suppressed. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements on April 27, 1951. On April 27 of the following year, Gong Pinmei specially held a Mass in Xujiahui Cathedral, allowing the families of these counter-revolutionary elements to sit in the front row, calling them "glorious families," in order to cheer up the counter-revolutionary elements. The Gong Pinmei group repeatedly ordered that believers were not allowed to report hidden counter-revolutionary elements to the People's Government. Fu Youzhen, a squad leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League, infiltrated the Shanghai Catholic Home for the Aged to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. In 1953, he was sentenced by the government to two years of control. At the sentencing rally, Xu Baoshan, Ding Wancheng, and Yang Shouren, elderly workers at the home, were enraged and exposed Fu Youzhen's crimes. After the meeting, Huang Hua, a core member of the Gong Pinmei group, immediately summoned the three, saying that they had "offended God," and forced these three white-haired old men to kneel in front of all the believers for two or three hours. From then on, they never received the "Holy Communion" again.
    After the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began, the Gong Pinmei group coordinated with the U.S. imperialist armed invasion of Korea and launched an unprecedentedly intense campaign. They organized dedicated personnel in several places, including the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in Shanghai, to listen to "Voice of America" and spread various unfounded rumors to the masses through the church. The Gong Pinmei group at that time actually became a branch of the U.S. "Psychological Warfare Department." In addition to this, the Gong Pinmei group also repeatedly instructed Catholics not to donate money to buy planes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, not to join the army and military cadre schools, not to participate in other patriotic activities, and so on.
    These counter-revolutionary elements also carried out malicious sabotage against the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements. As soon as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements began, a reactionary slogan was posted at Gong Pinmei's residence: "God gave my ancestors an early commandment, the Three Antis and Four Recoveries are sinful," the four characters "Three Antis and Four Recoveries" were written particularly prominently on the slogan, in order to imply that the People's Government's "Three-Anti" and "Four-Anti" Movements (Shanghai's "Five-Anti" was called "Four-Anti" at the beginning) were "sinful."
    After the announcement of the general task of the state's transition period, the Gong Pinmei group's sabotage activities became even more frantic. On November 21, 1953, Gong Pinmei openly issued a notice calling on "fellow believers not to go astray," and arranged for core members Jin Luxian, Chen Yuntang, Wang Fang, Wu Yingfeng, etc., to continuously "preach" in Yangjingbang Church, Diwang Church, Peter Church, Xujiahui Church, Sacred Heart Church, etc., distorting and slandering the Party's general line in an attempt to weaken the general line's great influence among the masses.
    But all these activities of theirs could not stop the progress of the revolutionary cause of our people in the slightest, and only exposed their own counter-revolutionary faces as a result.
    The patriotic masses in Shanghai had long harbored righteous indignation towards the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, but this group of counter-revolutionary elements was previously sheltered by the Communist Party traitors Rao Shushi and Pan Hannian, allowing them to remain at large. It was not until the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was exposed that this group of counter-revolutionary elements hidden in Shanghai Catholicism became alarmed. They decided to adopt more covert methods to be enemies of the Chinese people. Core members of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group instructed their subordinates, saying: "We must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng incident. Hu Feng's mistake was being too high-profile and exposing himself, so we must be smarter in the future and vehemently condemn Hu Feng when studying in order to show our loyalty." But the people of Shanghai further raised their awareness and sharpened their eyes in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, and finally exposed this gang of heinous counter-revolutionary black gangs in early September. Now, the chief culprits such as Gong Pinmei have been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in accordance with the law. This measure has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people in Shanghai. Catholics and clergy in Shanghai have also received a profound education in patriotism in this struggle, and further raised their awareness in the process of the struggle. This year, on National Day, the national flag of the motherland was raised for the first time in the churches previously controlled by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group (the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group had been forbidding them from hanging the national flag of the motherland for the past few years, which shows how crazy this counter-revolutionary group was), and many churches were decorated with lanterns and streamers and held National Day Masses. The ranks of Shanghai Catholics appeared in the surging parade of patriotic masses, and many believers were moved to tears. They deeply felt that eliminating the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group not only protected the construction cause of the motherland, but also protected their legitimate religious activities.
