    Under the Guise of Religion
    -- Crime Two of the Gong Pinmei Counter-Revolutionary Group
    Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group has consistently used the smoke screen of so-called "religious activities" to conceal their counter-revolutionary truth. But anyone can see that their actions have nothing in common with legitimate religious activities.
    The so-called "sermons" frequently conducted by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group were actually thorough counter-revolutionary propaganda. They used every vile word they could to curse the new China as a "dark world" and a "reign of sin," referring to the People's Government and the Communist Party as "devils" and "enemies," fanatically inciting believers to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government. May I ask: Today, the people of our country are enthusiastically and selflessly engaged in socialist construction, and everyone is delighted by the ever-changing face of the motherland. Why are these people so full of murderous intent towards the new China? What else is this kind of so-called "religious activity" but the most blatant counter-revolutionary agitation?
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group falsely accused the People's Government of undermining religious activities, in order to deceive those who were unaware of the truth and conceal their counter-revolutionary truth. This is completely futile. Countless facts provided by Catholics in Shanghai during this patriotic movement have proven that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has always adopted a policy of protecting religious beliefs and legitimate public religious activities; and it is precisely the Gong Pinmei group that has undermined legitimate religious activities and the lives of believers. These counter-revolutionary elements used their religious authority to violently interfere in the family and social lives of believers, preventing them from participating in any beneficial social activities. If believers wanted to participate in the Huai River project, they would say "controlling the Huai River is sinful"; student believers attending political classes at school was also a "crime" and they would tell them to skip class; farmer believers participating in agricultural production cooperatives was also "sinful". The Gong Pinmei group also preached: "God's plan dictates how much a piece of land can produce at most. If people want to change this using any method and exceed God's plan, it cannot be done.” Other activities such as believers watching movies, reading progressive books, reading newspapers, visiting the Soviet Exhibition Center, accepting state-funded benefits, participating in various mass gatherings, publishing articles in newspapers and magazines, etc., were all called "criminal" behaviors. In short, they wanted to isolate all believers from all progressive cultural life. The Gong Pinmei group even included elementary school students participating in the Young Pioneers as "sinful," and the entire family would be "excommunicated." One Catholic in the Xujiahui district, because his child wore a red scarf, was threatened by Gong Pinmei and others, causing the whole family to cry, unable to eat or sleep. Is this kind of lawless and tyrannical interference in people's basic rights also some kind of "religious activity"?
    The vast majority of Catholics in Shanghai love their country and actively participated in various patriotic movements against imperialist aggression. The Gong Pinmei group used all kinds of despicable means such as insults, attacks, and intimidation against these patriotic believers, scolding them as "lackeys of the devil," and even directing secret agents and hooligans to beat and humiliate them. Gu Pingsheng, an old Catholic in the Daturu Catholic Church, because he reported a hidden counter-revolutionary element, Zhang Xibin and Chen Zuhuan, key members of the Gong Pinmei group, illegally imprisoned Gu and verbally and physically abused him. Chen Tingliang, a Catholic in Zhennan Street, Xuhui District, because he participated in the struggle against imperialist elements within the Catholic Church, the Gong Pinmei group constantly dispatched hooligans to throw feces at his door, into his foot bath, on his clotheslines, and into his water tank. When the Gong Pinmei group was uncovered, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau found a private prison set up by the Gong Pinmei group in the Renaihui General Hospital on Chongqing South Road in Shanghai. The door frame of this prison was fitted with a seven- or eight-foot-high, three- or four-foot-wide iron gate, and the lock on the door was larger than a fist. Inside, there was also a sturdy wooden door. It was in this dark and gloomy prison that the Gong Pinmei group illegally imprisoned a nun named Shu Haiyun! Because she was dissatisfied with the arrogant behavior of Zhou Baoying, a key member of the Gong Pinmei group, she was locked in this private prison by members of the Gong Pinmei group on November 2, 1954. Are these acts of Gong Pinmei and others, who disregard the laws of the People's Republic of China, set up private prisons and tribunals, and arbitrarily trample on human rights, also some kind of "religious activity"?
    Gong Pinmei and his gang of thugs, soaked in counter-revolutionary poison, dreamed day and night of dragging the new China back to the dark ages of imperialist and Kuomintang traitor rule. In recent years, they have carried out sabotage activities in a tit-for-tat, planned, and organized manner against various social reforms of decisive significance for consolidating our people's democratic system, against various patriotic movements that demonstrated the patriotic consciousness of our people, and against other major measures of the People's Government.
    During the implementation of the land reform, at the end of November 1950, Gong Pinmei convened a meeting of nine core members, including Li Du and Zhu Xuefan, "to focus on studying how to sabotage the land reform. Regarding this issue, Gong Pinmei first slandered the land policy, saying: 'It is completely unreasonable for the poor to forcibly seize and divide the land of the landlords without contributing any sweat or blood. The Communist Party is using the method of land reform to win people's hearts. Believers should be told not to accuse the landlords at public trials and struggle meetings, and not to divide the landlords' land and property. If they are forced to receive land and property, it cannot be considered their own property, but rather held in trust for the landlords, to be returned to the landlords when the People's Government collapses,' etc. ... Gong Pinmei also said: 'Believers who receive land and property cannot sell it without the landlord's consent.' Finally, he specifically ordered that all land licenses owned by the church be photographed and preserved abroad, so that when the People's Government collapses in the future, they can be recovered based on these photos." (Quoted from Li Du's confession) Later, Gong Pinmei wrote his reactionary speech into a written regulation in Latin and distributed it in January 1951, taking advantage of the gathering of Catholic clergy from various places at the Dongjiadu Church in Shanghai for "retreat." The Gong Pinmei group not only worked with imperialist elements to photograph the land contracts of the Catholic Church and send them abroad, but also helped Liu Junliang and Liu Yengeng, local bullies and landlords in Qibao Town, Longhua District, Shanghai, to photograph the land contracts of more than 190 mu of land. After the land of these two local bullies and landlords was distributed to the peasants, Gong Pinmei immediately sent Fu Hezhou to give them 200 yuan as a sign of "condolences."
    The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was filled with bitter hatred for the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionary elements, because they themselves were a group of people who should be suppressed. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements on April 27, 1951. On April 27 of the following year, Gong Pinmei specially held a Mass in Xujiahui Cathedral, allowing the families of these counter-revolutionary elements to sit in the front row, calling them "glorious families," in order to cheer up the counter-revolutionary elements. The Gong Pinmei group repeatedly ordered that believers were not allowed to report hidden counter-revolutionary elements to the People's Government. Fu Youzhen, a squad leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League, infiltrated the Shanghai Catholic Home for the Aged to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. In 1953, he was sentenced by the government to two years of control. At the sentencing rally, Xu Baoshan, Ding Wancheng, and Yang Shouren, elderly workers at the home, were enraged and exposed Fu Youzhen's crimes. After the meeting, Huang Hua, a core member of the Gong Pinmei group, immediately summoned the three, saying that they had "offended God," and forced these three white-haired old men to kneel in front of all the believers for two or three hours. From then on, they never received the "Holy Communion" again.
    After the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began, the Gong Pinmei group coordinated with the U.S. imperialist armed invasion of Korea and launched an unprecedentedly intense campaign. They organized dedicated personnel in several places, including the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in Shanghai, to listen to "Voice of America" and spread various unfounded rumors to the masses through the church. The Gong Pinmei group at that time actually became a branch of the U.S. "Psychological Warfare Department." In addition to this, the Gong Pinmei group also repeatedly instructed Catholics not to donate money to buy planes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, not to join the army and military cadre schools, not to participate in other patriotic activities, and so on.
    These counter-revolutionary elements also carried out malicious sabotage against the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements. As soon as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements began, a reactionary slogan was posted at Gong Pinmei's residence: "God gave my ancestors an early commandment, the Three Antis and Four Recoveries are sinful," the four characters "Three Antis and Four Recoveries" were written particularly prominently on the slogan, in order to imply that the People's Government's "Three-Anti" and "Four-Anti" Movements (Shanghai's "Five-Anti" was called "Four-Anti" at the beginning) were "sinful."
    After the announcement of the general task of the state's transition period, the Gong Pinmei group's sabotage activities became even more frantic. On November 21, 1953, Gong Pinmei openly issued a notice calling on "fellow believers not to go astray," and arranged for core members Jin Luxian, Chen Yuntang, Wang Fang, Wu Yingfeng, etc., to continuously "preach" in Yangjingbang Church, Diwang Church, Peter Church, Xujiahui Church, Sacred Heart Church, etc., distorting and slandering the Party's general line in an attempt to weaken the general line's great influence among the masses.
    But all these activities of theirs could not stop the progress of the revolutionary cause of our people in the slightest, and only exposed their own counter-revolutionary faces as a result.
    The patriotic masses in Shanghai had long harbored righteous indignation towards the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group, but this group of counter-revolutionary elements was previously sheltered by the Communist Party traitors Rao Shushi and Pan Hannian, allowing them to remain at large. It was not until the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was exposed that this group of counter-revolutionary elements hidden in Shanghai Catholicism became alarmed. They decided to adopt more covert methods to be enemies of the Chinese people. Core members of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group instructed their subordinates, saying: "We must learn a lesson from the Hu Feng incident. Hu Feng's mistake was being too high-profile and exposing himself, so we must be smarter in the future and vehemently condemn Hu Feng when studying in order to show our loyalty." But the people of Shanghai further raised their awareness and sharpened their eyes in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, and finally exposed this gang of heinous counter-revolutionary black gangs in early September. Now, the chief culprits such as Gong Pinmei have been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in accordance with the law. This measure has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people in Shanghai. Catholics and clergy in Shanghai have also received a profound education in patriotism in this struggle, and further raised their awareness in the process of the struggle. This year, on National Day, the national flag of the motherland was raised for the first time in the churches previously controlled by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group (the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group had been forbidding them from hanging the national flag of the motherland for the past few years, which shows how crazy this counter-revolutionary group was), and many churches were decorated with lanterns and streamers and held National Day Masses. The ranks of Shanghai Catholics appeared in the surging parade of patriotic masses, and many believers were moved to tears. They deeply felt that eliminating the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group not only protected the construction cause of the motherland, but also protected their legitimate religious activities.

    在宗教外衣的掩盖下
    ——龚品梅反革命集团罪行之二
    本报记者　季音
    龚品梅反革命集团一直用所谓“宗教活动”的烟幕来遮掩他们的反革命真相。但是谁都可以看得出，他们的所作所为，同正当的宗教活动是没有任何共同之点的。
    龚品梅反革命集团经常进行的所谓“讲道”，实际上都是彻底的反革命宣传。他们用尽了一切恶毒的字眼，咒骂新中国是“黑暗世界”、“罪恶的统治”，指人民政府和共产党为“魔鬼”、“敌人”，狂热地煽动教徒们反对共产党和人民政府。请问：今天我国人民都在热情忘我地从事社会主义建设，人人都为祖国的日新月异而欢欣，这些人对新中国为什么那样杀气冲天呢？这种所谓“宗教活动”，不是最露骨的反革命鼓动又是什么？
    龚品梅反革命集团诬蔑人民政府破坏宗教活动，借以迷惑不明真相的人，掩藏他们的反革命真相，这是完全徒劳的。上海天主教徒在这次爱国运动中所提供的无数事实，证明了上海市人民政府对于宗教信仰和正当的公开的宗教活动，始终采取了保护的政策；而破坏正当宗教活动和教徒生活的恰恰是龚品梅集团自己。这些反革命分子利用宗教职权，横暴地干涉教徒的家庭生活和社会生活，不准他们参与一切有益的社会活动。教徒要去参加治淮工程，他们就说“治淮是有罪的”；学生教徒在学校中听政治课，也是“犯罪”，要他们逃课；农民教徒要参加农业生产合作社也“有罪”，龚品梅集团并且宣扬：“一块土地天主计划顶多出产多少，假使人要想用啥方法来更改，超过天主的计划，是不能够的。”其他如教徒看电影，看进步书籍，看报纸，参观苏联展览馆，接受国家的公费待遇，参加各种群众集会，在报刊上发表文章等等，一律被称为“犯罪”行为，总之他们要所有教徒同一切进步文化生活隔绝。龚品梅集团甚至把小学生参加少年先锋队也列入“有罪”的范围，全家要受到“绝罚”。徐家汇区有一个天主教徒，因为孩子带上了红领巾，受到了龚品梅等人的威胁，因而全家痛哭，吃不下饭，睡不着觉。这种无法无天的对人的基本权利的暴虐干涉，难道也是什么“宗教活动”么？
    上海的绝大多数天主教徒热爱祖国，积极参加了反对帝国主义侵略的各种爱国运动。龚品梅集团对这些爱国教徒便用尽了侮辱、打击、恐吓等卑劣手段，辱骂他们是“魔鬼的喽啰”，甚至指挥特务流氓殴打凌辱他们。大通路天主堂的老教徒顾平生，因为检举了一个暗藏的反革命分子，龚品梅集团的骨干分子张希斌、陈祖焕就把顾非法禁闭起来，并加以辱骂殴打。徐汇区镇南街天主教徒陈廷亮因为参加了反对天主教内帝国主义分子的斗争，龚品梅集团就不断派遣流氓把粪便掷在他家的门口、脚桶里、晒衣服竿上和水缸中。破获龚品梅集团的时候，上海公安机关在上海重庆南路仁爱会总院里，发现了一座龚品梅集团私设的监牢，这座监牢的门框上装了一道七、八尺高、三、四尺宽的铁栅门，门上的锁比拳头还大，里面还有一道结实的木板门。就在这座暗无天日的监牢里，龚品梅集团非法囚禁着一个叫舒海云的修女！她因为不满龚品梅集团骨干分子周葆英的蛮横行为，竟在一九五四年十一月二日被龚品梅集团分子关进这座私牢。龚品梅等人这种蔑视中华人民共和国法律、私设监狱法庭、随意蹂躏人权的暴行，难道还是什么“宗教活动”么？
    龚品梅等这群浸透了反革命毒汁的匪徒，日夜梦想着把新中国拉回到帝国主义、国民党卖国贼统治的黑暗年代去。几年来，他们对巩固我国人民民主制度有决定意义的各种社会改革，对表现我国人民爱国主义觉悟的各种爱国运动，以及对人民政府的其他的重大措施，都针锋相对地、有计划有组织地进行了破坏活动。
    在实行土地改革的时候，一九五○年十一月底，龚品梅召集了李度、朱雪帆等核心分子九人开会，“着重的研究了如何破坏土地改革问题，对这个问题，龚品梅首先污蔑土地政策说：‘穷人不出什么血汗，就把地主的地强夺分掉是十分不合理的，共产党利用土地改革的办法，是笼络人心的。应该告诉教徒不准他们在公审和斗争大会上控诉地主，不准他们去分地主的土地和财物。如果被迫必须分到土地财物时，不能算是自己所有权，而是给地主代管，待将来人民政府垮台时再还给地主’等等，……龚品梅还说：‘教徒分得的土地财物，不得地主同意不得变卖’，最后并特别命令把教会所有的土地执照，全部拍照下来，想办法保存在国外，待将来人民政府垮台时，凭这些执照的照片再收回来。”（引自李度供词）以后，龚品梅把他这篇反动讲话用拉丁文写成一篇书面规定，在一九五一年一月，趁各地天主教神职人员集中上海董家渡堂“避静”的时候发了下去。龚品梅集团不但同帝国主义分子一起，把天主教会的土地契约拍成照片送到国外，又帮助上海龙华区七宝镇恶霸地主刘君亮、刘砚耕，把一百九十多亩田地的田契拍成照片。这两个恶霸地主的地被分配给农民以后，龚品梅马上派傅鹤洲送给他们二百元表示“慰问”。
    龚品梅反革命集团对于镇压反革命分子的斗争更是充满了刻骨的仇恨，因为他们本身就是一群应当被镇压的对象。上海市人民政府在一九五一年四月二十七日逮捕了一批反革命分子，在第二年的四月二十七日，龚品梅特地在徐家汇大堂举行了弥撒，让这些反革命分子的家属坐在前排，称之为“光荣家属”，以此为反革命分子打气。龚品梅集团曾三令五申，不准教徒向人民政府检举暗藏的反革命分子。三青团分队长傅友贞混入了上海天主教残老院进行反革命破坏活动，一九五三年，被政府判决管制两年。宣判大会上该院老年工人徐宝山、丁晚成、杨守仁激于义愤，揭露了傅友贞的罪行。会后龚品梅集团核心分子黄华立即把三人找去，说他们“得罪了天主”，硬逼这三个须发已白的老人，在全体教徒面前跪了两三个小时。从此他们再也没有领到“圣体”。
    抗美援朝运动开始后，龚品梅集团配合美帝国主义对朝鲜的武装进攻，展开了空前紧张的活动。他们在上海董家渡天主堂等好几处地方组织专人收听“美国之音”，把各种无稽谣言通过教堂散播到群众中去。龚品梅集团当时实际上成了美国“心理作战部”的一个分支机构。除此之外，龚品梅集团还连续指示天主教徒不准捐款购买飞机大炮支援中国人民志愿军，不准参加部队和军事干部学校，不准参加其他爱国活动，等等。
    这些反革命分子也针对伟大的“三反”“五反”运动进行了恶毒的破坏。“三反”“五反”运动刚开始，龚品梅的住地就贴出了一张反动标语：“天主早给我元祖出了一条诫令，三反四复就是罪恶”，标语上“三反四复”四个字写得特别引人注目，借以暗示人民政府的“三反”“四反”运动（上海“五反”开始时称“四反”）是“罪恶”。
    国家过渡时期的总任务宣布后，龚品梅集团的破坏活动更加疯狂，一九五三年十一月二十一日，龚品梅公然发出通告，号召“教友不要走入歧途”，并布置核心分子金鲁贤、陈云棠、王方、吴应枫等，在洋泾浜堂、帝王堂、伯多禄堂、徐家汇堂、圣心堂等地连续“讲道”，歪曲诬蔑党的总路线，力图削弱总路线在群众中的巨大影响。
    但是他们的所有这些活动，丝毫也不能阻挡我国人民革命事业的前进，结果只是暴露了他们自己的反革命面目。
    上海爱国群众对于龚品梅反革命集团是早有义愤的，但是这批反革命分子过去受到了共产党叛徒饶漱石、潘汉年的庇护，使它仍能逍遥法外。直到胡风反革命集团被揭发后，这群暗藏在上海天主教中的反革命分子才惊慌起来。他们决定采取更隐蔽的方法同中国人民为敌。龚品梅反革命集团的核心分子指示所属说：“从胡风事件要得出一个教训，胡风的错误是太冒头了，把自己暴露了，所以我们以后要学得聪明些，在学习时应痛骂胡风，以明心迹。”但是上海人民在肃清反革命分子的斗争中进一步提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，就在九月初，终于揭发了这批罪大恶极的反革命黑帮。现在龚品梅等首恶分子，已经由上海市公安机关依法逮捕。这个措施，获得了上海广大人民的热烈拥护。上海的天主教徒和神职人员在这次斗争中也受到了深刻的爱国主义的教育，在斗争的过程中进一步提高了觉悟。今年国庆节，过去为龚品梅反革命集团所把持的教堂里第一次升起了祖国的国旗（过去几年龚品梅反革命集团一直禁止他们悬挂祖国国旗，可见这个反革命集团疯狂到什么程度），许多教堂张灯结彩，举行了国庆弥撒，上海天主教徒的队伍出现在狂涛似的爱国群众的游行队伍中，不少教徒都感动得流泪。他们深深感到，肃清龚品梅反革命集团不但是保护了祖国的建设事业，同时也保护了他们正当的宗教活动。
