To the Editor:
    I want to expose the erroneous behavior of Zhang Shuchun, manager of the Hubei Huanggang Branch of the China National Native Produce Company, who only knows how to indulge in personal enjoyment and is irresponsible in his work.

    Since Zhang Shuchun was transferred to the branch company as manager in February of this year, he first abused public funds for his personal prestige and comfort, spending more than 700 yuan to buy 39 pieces of furniture, including gold-edged filing cabinets, swivel chairs, leather chairs, and nine-drawer desks; he occupied more than half of these pieces of furniture himself. For example, he originally had a single palm bed, but in preparation for his future marriage (he doesn't even have a marriage partner yet), he bought a new double palm bed; he bought a beautiful gold-edged cabinet on the pretext that his existing filing cabinet was inadequate, but in reality, he used this cabinet to store his own clothes and socks. Then, he fabricated a plan to build a dormitory for a nanny. The superior company did not approve it because the branch company already had enough housing; however, he used the verbal consent of a responsible comrade from the Special Commissioner's Office's Financial and Economic Committee as a reason to arbitrarily use 2,000 yuan of employee welfare funds to build a nanny room. In addition, he felt that the company's original radio was too old, so he bought a new one for more than 250 yuan and installed it in his own dormitory.

    Zhang Shuchun is completely irresponsible for the company's business operations. The company's phenomenon of blindly purchasing goods without regard for the needs of the masses is very serious. For example, the company blindly bought more than 1,000 jin of pine nuts from Guangxi, which the local people did not even know about, resulting in them not being sold; 6,000 jin of corn flour produced in Guizhou were purchased from Shanghai, but because the price was twice as high as local flour, it was all stockpiled until it deteriorated and became moldy. There are many similar examples. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1.77 million yuan worth of non-staple foods are stockpiled due to blind purchasing, of which more than 70,000 yuan worth of goods have deteriorated, and more than 170,000 yuan worth of goods are about to deteriorate.

    Many staff members, seeing these phenomena, suggested that Zhang Shuchun hold a meeting to correct the chaotic phenomena in the procurement work. However, he ignored this suggestion, and instead said: "Just do as I arrange. If I am wrong, you can go to the Supervisory Office to sue me..." Therefore, no one dared to offer him any advice afterward.

    We request the Hubei Provincial Native Produce Company and the Huanggang Special Commissioner's Office Supervisory Office to inspect the work of the Huanggang Branch and give Zhang Shuchun the punishment he deserves.

### 黄冈土产分公司经理张树春贪图生活享受工作不尽职责

    黄冈土产分公司经理张树春贪图生活享受工作不尽职责编辑同志：
    我要揭发中国土产公司湖北省黄冈分公司经理张树春只知贪图个人享受而对工作不负责任的错误行为。
    张树春在今年二月间调到分公司当经理以后，首先就为了个人的排场和舒适，滥用公款，花七百多元钱去买了镶金边的文件柜、转椅、皮椅、九屉办公桌等三十九件家具；这些家具买来以后他本人就占用了一半以上。例如，他原来有一张单人棕床，但为了准备将来结婚（目前他连结婚对象还没有），就新买了一张双人大棕床；他用现有的文件柜不好为理由，买了一个镶有金边的漂亮的柜子，而实际却用这个柜子来装自己的衣服和鞋袜。接着，他又编造了一个修建保姆宿舍的计划。上级公司因为分公司的房子已经够住了，所以没有批准；但是他用专署财政经济委员会某负责同志口头同意修建为理由，就擅自动用职工福利费二千元修了一栋保姆室。另外，他又嫌公司原有的收音机太旧，就用二百五十多元买了一架新的，安装在自己的宿舍里。
    张树春对公司的业务工作却完全不负责任。这个公司不根据群众需要而盲目进货的现象很严重。如当地群众根本不知道的松仁子，公司就盲目从广西买回了一千多斤，结果销不出去；从上海购买贵州出产的包谷粉六千斤，结果由于价格比本地的面粉高出一倍，全部积压，直到变质霉烂了。类似的事例还很多。据初步统计，由于盲目进货而积压的副食品达一百七十七万多元，其中已变质的商品价值达七万多元，即将变质的商品价值达十七万多元。
    很多工作人员看到这些现象，曾建议张树春开会纠正采购工作中的混乱现象。但是他对这个建议却置之不理，反而说：“我怎样布置，就怎么办，如果我错了，你们可以到监察处告我……。”因此，以后再也没有人敢向他提什么意见了。
    我们要求湖北省土产公司和黄冈专署监察处检查黄冈分公司的工作，并给张树春以应得的处分。
