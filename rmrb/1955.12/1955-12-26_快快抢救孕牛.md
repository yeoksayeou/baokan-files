The Nanjing Food Company's slaughterhouse has continuously discovered 132 pregnant cows among the beef cattle sent from various places for slaughter, and 17 cows even gave birth to calves in the slaughterhouse's cattle pens.

This batch of cattle, after inspection and approval by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Food Company, has been sent to agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanjing to participate in production. Ninety-seven pregnant cows have already been sold to agricultural production cooperatives.

These cattle were purchased by the food companies of Xuzhou and Zhenjiang prefectures in Jiangsu Province. According to government regulations, when farmers sell cattle for slaughter, they must obtain a certificate from the township people's committee, a veterinary inspection, and approval from the district office before sending the cattle to the food company. However, some district and township staff have not taken due responsibility for this work.

The phenomenon of arbitrarily approving the slaughter of pregnant cows has continued to occur recently. From February to November this year, the Nanjing Food Company inspected about ten pregnant cows each month; however, from December 1st to December 12th, within twelve days, twenty-two pregnant cows were inspected. The number of pregnant cows already approved for slaughter transported from the Xuzhou area has increased more than threefold compared to the past. The leading authorities of Xuzhou and Zhenjiang prefectures must conduct a serious inspection and take concrete measures to stop the arbitrary approval of the slaughter of pregnant cows.

    快快抢救孕牛
    南京市食品公司的宰牛场在各地送来宰杀的菜牛中，连续发现了一百三十二头怀孕的母牛，而且有十七头母牛在屠宰场的牛舍里生下了小牛。
    这批耕牛经江苏省农林厅和食品公司会同检验批准，已被送到在南京市郊区的农业生产合作社中参加生产，其中的九十七头孕牛已卖给农业生产合作社。
    这些耕牛都是由江苏省徐州、镇江两专区的食品公司收购来的。按照政府规定，农民出卖可以宰杀的牛的时候，要经过乡人民委员会的证明，兽医的检查，区公所的批准，才能把牛送到食品公司。但是有些区、乡的工作人员对于这项工作，没有负起应有的责任。
    任意批准屠宰孕牛的现象，最近还不断发生。从今年二月到十一月，南京食品公司每月大约检验出十条孕牛；可是从十二月一日到十二日的十二天中，就检验出二十二头孕牛。从徐州地区运来的已经批准宰杀的孕牛比过去增加了两倍以上。徐州和镇江专区的领导机关必须认真检查，采取切实的措施，制止任意批准宰杀孕牛。
