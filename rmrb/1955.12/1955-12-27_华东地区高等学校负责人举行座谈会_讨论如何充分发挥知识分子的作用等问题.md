Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 26th. The Shanghai Higher Education Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education recently convened a symposium in Shanghai, where Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi gave instructions on the rational arrangement of intellectuals and other issues. Chen Yi pointed out that scientific and cultural and educational workers should respond to the requirements of the surging national economic construction. Chen Yi said that the status and role of senior intellectuals in socialist construction should be correctly estimated; a series of measures should be taken to improve their working and living conditions, so that they can give full play to their wisdom and abilities and serve the great socialist construction. He said that Communist Party members working in universities should conduct strict self-criticism, further strengthen unity with non-Party comrades, truly learn from others with an open mind, learn from each other, integrate with them, and join hands with senior intellectuals in universities to participate in the current high tide of national economic development.

Chen Yi also analyzed and explained the current situations, the agricultural cooperation movement, and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

The symposium was held from the 20th to the 23rd. The heads of various universities in the East China region under the guidance and contact of the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education participated in the symposium. They discussed how universities should conduct comprehensive inspections, comprehensive planning, and give full play to the role of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, in the face of the new situation of rapid progress in national construction.

Chen Qiwu, Director of the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education and Minister of the School Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward his opinions on the significance, requirements, main content, and issues that should be paid attention to in the comprehensive inspection and comprehensive planning. Chen Qiwu emphasized how to correctly implement the Party's policy toward intellectuals, improve the Party's leadership over intellectuals, and give full play to the role of senior intellectuals.

Chen Wangdao, President of Fudan University, Wang Yanan, President of Xiamen University, Pan Shu, President of Nanjing University, and Peng Kang, President of Jiaotong University, spoke at the symposium. In their speeches, they all expressed their confidence in the victory of socialist construction in the motherland. The speakers were deeply moved by the care of the Party and the state for intellectuals and examined their own conservative thoughts. They expressed that they would strive to meet the requirements and expectations of the country and the people for universities and senior intellectuals. The heads of various universities also stated that they would further conduct comprehensive inspections and comprehensive planning of their respective schools. Many Party member leaders examined the implementation of the Party's policy towards intellectuals by themselves and the Party committees of their schools. Non-Party leaders of universities put forward many criticisms and constructive opinions on giving full play to the role of intellectuals, improving teaching quality, and developing and strengthening scientific research work. Many non-Party leaders also expressed at the symposium that they would work hard to transform their thinking and actively improve their professional abilities.
