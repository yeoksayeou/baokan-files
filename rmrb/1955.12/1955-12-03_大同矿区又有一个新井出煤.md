    Another New Coal Mine in Datong Mining Area Produces Coal
    Recently, another new coal mine in Datong Coal Mine has started producing coal.
    The Datong Mining Bureau built this small coal mine in Lang'ergou in June. The main shaft was tunneled through at the end of September, and the shaft development and arching project were completed. On the evening of October 26, the workers excitedly pulled the first cart of coal from the mine. From then on, along the mountainside on the side of Lang'ergou, two newly built endless rope transport roads, each over 800 meters long, began to transport coal day and night. As of November 14, more than 900 tons of coal have been mined from this new mine. Most of this coal is accumulated coal abandoned in the first coal seam during the Kuomintang reactionary rule due to predatory mining methods. Now the workers are mining it again to serve the construction of the motherland.
    This new mine is still in the trial mining stage. The newly built distribution panels, substations and other small houses near the wellhead are waiting to be installed with equipment; the first tunneling team to go down the well is preparing the working site for future coal mining. Once it is officially put into production, it will increase the country's coal production by hundreds of thousands of tons every year.

### 大同矿区又有一个新井出煤

    大同矿区又有一个新井出煤
    大同煤矿最近又有一个新井开始出煤。
    大同矿务局于六月在狼儿沟新建这个小型煤井，九月底凿通了主井井筒，完成了井筒的开拓和发碹工程，到十月二十六日傍晚，工人们兴奋地从井下拉出第一车煤来。从此，沿着狼儿沟侧面的山腰上，两股新修成的长达八百多公尺的无极绳运输道，就开始日夜输送煤了。截至十一月十四日止，在这个新井中采出来的煤炭已有九百多吨。这些煤炭中，绝大部分是国民党反动统治时期采用掠夺式的开采方法所丢弃在第一煤层中的积煤，现在工人们又把它开采出来为建设祖国服务了。
    这个新井现在还是试采。在井口附近新修的配电盘、变电所等小屋，尚待安装设备；第一个下井的掘进组，正在为今后采煤准备工作场子。到正式投入生产后，它将每年为祖国增产数十万吨煤。
