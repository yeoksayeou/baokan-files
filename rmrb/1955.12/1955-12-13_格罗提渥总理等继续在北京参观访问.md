Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Premier Grotewohl and his wife, along with members of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, visited the Forbidden City this morning, accompanied by Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture.
　　
During their visit to the International Friendship Hall in the Forbidden City, the distinguished guests viewed various gifts presented by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic to the government and people of the People's Republic of China, including a statue of Marx presented by President Pieck to Chairman Mao Zedong. Premier Grotewohl also saw two gifts he personally presented to Premier Zhou Enlai – a "copper cigarette case" and a "portrait of Liu Shimei, a female worker at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, a national model worker in the textile industry," as well as a plaster statue of himself, presented by the German people to the Northeast Song and Dance Troupe of China.
　　
The exhibition of Dunhuang art in the Forbidden City greatly interested the distinguished guests. This exhibition reflects the evolution and development of Chinese classical art over approximately a thousand years, from the fourth to the fourteenth centuries. Here, the distinguished guests visited a model made according to the original state of the mural in Cave 285 of Dunhuang, and admired the copied and imitated exquisite colored sculptures and magnificent murals of ancient China.
　　
During their visit to the Forbidden City, the distinguished guests greatly admired the brilliant architectural art created by the Chinese working people. Premier Grotewohl and others wrote in the guest book: "We pay tribute to the great cultural traditions of China, which today belong to the people who have overthrown feudalism and are building socialism."
　　
Dr. Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, and Mr. Gipner, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, visited the Wilhelm Pieck Class at Beijing No. 65 Middle School this morning. Since its official naming on January 23, 1953, all students in the class have actively strived to be good students of Chairman Mao and President Wilhelm Pieck, achieving good results in both learning and extracurricular activities, and were selected as the outstanding class of the whole school in the last academic year. The distinguished guests visited the classroom and an exhibition room of this class. Deputy Prime Minister Bolz also conveyed President Wilhelm Pieck's concern and the friendship of German youth to all the students. When Deputy Prime Minister Bolz spoke, the students repeatedly stood up and cheered: "Pieck! Mao Zedong!" Then, the students of the Wilhelm Pieck Class presented Deputy Prime Minister Bolz with a class badge, a self-made mineral radio, and two outstanding student medals won by students. Deputy Prime Minister Bolz also personally gave badges of the Free German Youth League and the Young Pioneers to each student. During the visit to the exhibition room, the students screened the German film "The Examination" presented by President Wilhelm Pieck for the distinguished guests, and played the German song "Blue Flag Song" on harmonicas donated by German friends.
　　
This afternoon, Major General Dorvillezer, a member of the delegation and resident people's police officer, paid a visit to General Huang Kecheng, Deputy Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China.
