    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 29th: The rebuilt Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant grandly held its opening ceremony today.
    Li Yu, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, said at the meeting: Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is China's first new-type machine tool manufacturing plant. The Soviet government not only provided the most advanced designs and the latest equipment to the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, but also sent three groups of experts to provide specific guidance for the construction work. He said that 1956 is a crucial year for completing the Five-Year Plan, and the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will undertake major production tasks this year, which will play an important role in striving for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.
    Basmanov, Acting Consul General of the Soviet Consulate in Shenyang, Boberov, representative of the Soviet Foreign Economic Liaison Bureau, and Kuragin, head of the Soviet expert group at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, spoke at the meeting successively. They congratulated China on the completion of this modern machine tool plant and wished the factory staff new labor achievements in the future.
    Li Yu, on behalf of the First Ministry of Machine Building, presented the Soviet experts stationed at the factory with commemorative medals for the construction of the factory. All the staff of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant presented a letter of thanks to the Soviet experts.
    The conference concluded with the reading of a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.
    This morning, after Li Yu, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, cut the ribbon, the machine tool manufacturing plant officially started production. The guests inspected the various workshops, and they were very interested in the factory's huge scale and the latest Soviet equipment. They saw trained production personnel using advanced assembly line methods to manufacture metal cutting machine tools.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 29th: The rebuilding project of China's first new-type machine tool manufacturing plant—Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant—has been fully completed. The signing ceremony for acceptance was held on the afternoon of the 28th.
    The acceptance committee appointed by the State Council rated this factory as a machine tool manufacturing plant with "excellent" quality. Li Yu, Chairman of the Acceptance Committee and Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, said at the signing ceremony: It would have been impossible for the construction of this new type of machine tool plant to achieve excellent results without the help of Soviet experts. Some members proposed that the enthusiasm of Soviet experts should be clearly written into the project quality appraisal report. This suggestion was approved by the acceptance committee.
    Since the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant started construction in the spring of 1953, the Soviet Union has successively dispatched dozens of engineering experts to provide specific assistance in design and construction. They put forward many suggestions to ensure the quality of the project, transformed the factory's original old buildings into solid new buildings, and the installation of various equipment was also very precise. When construction was tight, they often did not rest on Sundays. In order to personally guide the construction of the building project, the Soviet expert Boryankov has been continuously re-employed three times since he came to China in 1953. He said: "I will definitely go back to my country after the factory is built." Today, he personally witnessed the completion of the factory. After the signing, the Soviet experts congratulated the factory leaders on the birth of the factory and shook hands with each other warmly.

    我国第一座新型工作母机制造厂
    沈阳第一机床厂开工生产
    新华社沈阳二十九日电　改建完成的沈阳第一机床厂二十九日隆重举行了开工生产典礼大会。
    第一机械工业部副部长黎玉在会上讲话说：沈阳第一机床厂是我国第一座新型的工作母机制造厂。苏联政府对沈阳第一机床厂不仅提供了最先进的设计和最新型的设备，而且派出了三批专家，具体指导建设工作。他说，一九五六年是我们完成五年计划关键性的一年，沈阳第一机床厂在这一年将担负重大的生产任务，这对争取提前完成五年计划将会起到重要的作用。
    苏联驻沈阳领事馆代总领事巴斯曼诺夫、苏联对外经济联络局代表波伯洛夫和沈阳第一机床厂苏联专家组长库拉金在会上先后讲话。他们对中国建成这座现代化的机床厂表示祝贺，并且预祝工厂工作人员今后获得新的劳动成就。
    黎玉在会上代表第一机械工业部赠给驻厂苏联专家以建厂纪念章。沈阳第一机床厂全体职工向苏联专家赠送了感谢信。
    大会最后宣读了向毛主席的致敬电。
    今天上午，在第一机械工业部副部长黎玉剪彩以后，这座工作母机制造厂就正式开工生产了。来宾们巡视了各个车间，他们对工厂的巨大规模和苏联最新式的设备感到很大兴趣。他们看到了受过训练的生产人员正在用先进的流水作业法，制造着金属切削机床。
    新华社沈阳二十九日电　中国第一座新型的工作母机制造厂——沈阳第一机床厂改建工程全部完工。验收的签字仪式在二十八日下午举行。
    国务院任命的验收委员会评定这个厂是工程质量“优”等的机床制造厂。验收委员会主任委员、第一机械工业部副部长黎玉在签字仪式上说：这座新型的工作母机厂的建设能获得优良的成绩，没有苏联专家帮助是不可能的。有的委员提议把苏联专家的热情鲜明地写到工程质量鉴定书上去。这个建议得到了验收委员会的赞同。
    沈阳第一机床厂自一九五三年春天动工以来，苏联先后派遣了几十位工程专家，具体帮助设计和施工。他们提出许多保证工程质量的建议，把工厂原有陈旧的厂房改建成为坚固的新型厂房，各种设备的安装也很精密。施工紧张的时候，他们常常星期天也不休息。苏联专家鲍良阔夫为了亲自指导建筑工程施工，一九五三年到中国后已经连续被延聘了三次。他说：“我一定等工厂建设起来后再回国。”今天，他亲自看到了工厂的建成。签字结束后，苏联专家们纷纷向工厂领导人员祝贺工厂的诞生，并互相热烈地握手。
