Guangdong's Sugarcane, Hemp, Silkworm, and Other Crops Increase Production

This year, Guangdong Province has achieved a general increase in the production of five industrial raw material crops: sugarcane, hemp, silkworm, tobacco, and tea. Preliminary statistics show that the planting area of industrial raw material crops in the province reached more than 2.1 million mu, an increase of more than 270,000 mu over last year. The total output has also greatly increased compared to last year. For example, the total output of sugarcane and tea has increased by about 11% compared to last year, hemp has increased by 65%, flue-cured tobacco has increased by nearly 80%, and silkworm production has increased by 8.1%. The increased production of these industrial raw materials has played a significant role in supporting sugar refining, hemp weaving, and other industrial production, as well as meeting people's needs. The province's five state-owned large sugar mills have already started crushing ahead of schedule in early November.

This year, in order to support farmers in technical crop areas to increase production, the state has issued a large number of loans for seeds, fertilizers, and pest control equipment. At the same time, the implementation of reasonable purchase prices and the signing of pre-purchase contracts have further encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for production, enabling them to achieve varying degrees of large-scale production increases despite the severe natural disasters. The average yield per mu of sugarcane in the Pearl River Delta, which is rich in sugarcane, is as high as 7,000 jin or more, with the highest reaching more than 23,000 jin per mu. The first agricultural production cooperative in Shazhou Township, Wuchuan County, had more than two mu of high-yield hemp fields, with an average yield of 1,282 jin per mu, creating the highest record of hemp yield per unit area in the province since liberation. The first agricultural production cooperative in Xijiao Township, Shunde County, produced more than 59 jin of white cocoons per silkworm sheet in autumn, which was also unprecedented.

    广东甘蔗黄麻蚕桑等增产
    今年，广东省甘蔗、黄麻、蚕桑、烟、茶等五种工业原料作物又普遍获得增产。初步统计，全省工业原料作物的种植面积达二百一十多万亩，比去年扩大二十七万多亩。总产量也比去年大为增加。如甘蔗、茶叶的总产量均比去年增加一成一左右，黄麻增加六成半，烤烟增加近八成，蚕桑增产百分之八点一。这些工业原料的增产，对支援制糖、麻织等工业生产和满足人民的需要都起了很大作用。全省五个国营大糖厂已经提前在十一月初开榨。
    今年国家为了支持技术作物区农民增加生产，发放了大量的种子、肥料和除虫药械的贷款。同时，由于贯彻执行了合理的收购价格和订立预购合同，更鼓舞了农民的生产热情，使得在各种自然灾害特重的情况下，仍普遍获得不同程度的大面积增产。全省盛产甘蔗的珠江三角洲平均每亩产量高达七千斤以上，最高的每亩产二万三千多斤。吴川县沙洲乡第一农业生产合作社有二亩多黄麻丰产田，每亩平均产一千二百八十二斤，创造了全省解放以来黄麻单位面积产量的最高纪录。顺德县细滘乡第一农业生产合作社在秋蚕每单张产白茧五十九斤多，也是过去所没有的。　（萧俊城）
