    The South Vietnamese Economy Under American Control
    Xiao Guang
    In March of this year, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles publicly declared that the United States would support the Ngo Dinh Diem group in establishing "a relatively sound economic situation." However, the situation in the past year has shown that not only has South Vietnam's economy shown no signs of improvement, but it is also deteriorating daily. The Associated Press also admitted on November 21 that the "more grim situation" in South Vietnam is: "Decreasing production, rising prices, and increasing unemployment."
    The deterioration of the South Vietnamese economy is primarily reflected in agricultural production. South Vietnam has always been a major rice-producing area in Asia, with a past annual output of 5 to 6 million tons, and an annual export of 1.5 million tons of rice; now it has to import rice from abroad. Agence France-Presse (AFP) said on October 17, when talking about the rice shortage in South Vietnam: "The difficulty of rice supply in Saigon is increasing day by day. Stocks were exhausted a few days ago. Rice has disappeared in most stores." South Vietnamese newspapers said that many rice shops in Saigon have no goods to sell, and it is very difficult for people to buy food. In terms of foreign trade, the deficit is increasing. According to AFP reports, in the first half of this year, South Vietnam's imports were 4.64 billion piastres (South Vietnamese currency), and exports were 1.208 billion piastres. The value of imports is almost four times that of exports. At present, due to the severe shortage of rice affecting exports, South Vietnam's foreign trade deficit will further increase. The "New York Times," a mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, predicted that South Vietnam's imports in 1955 would be about 300 million U.S. dollars, while its exports would only be 50 million U.S. dollars. Due to the lack of daily necessities, the currency has devalued, and prices have soared. At the end of October, the Ngo Dinh Diem group stipulated that the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the piastre was one to thirty-five. Before this, one U.S. dollar was worth about twenty-odd piastres. In June of this year, tael of gold was worth 3,600 piastres. In October, it had risen to more than 4,100 piastres. Rice has soared from 600 piastres per 100 kilograms to 1,200 to 1,300 piastres. The prices of other daily necessities have also generally risen. The "New York Times" correspondent in Saigon admitted: "High prices and the threat of inflation are troubling American and Vietnamese officials here."
    The deterioration of the economic situation in South Vietnam is caused by the United States' frenzied plunder and pursuit of war policies in South Vietnam. Shortly after the ceasefire, the United States massively equipped and trained troops for Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, preparing for new wars and establishing military terror rule to strengthen the suppression of the people. Not long ago, the Ngo Dinh Diem group had built four "combat-ready" heavily armed divisions; now it is building its air force and starting to reorganize "modernized" lightly armed divisions. At the same time, the United States also plans to establish a large number of "reserve forces" and "local police forces" for Ngo Dinh Diem. The huge expenditure on military expansion and war preparation accounts for the vast majority of the Ngo Dinh Diem group's financial budget, which greatly increases the burden on the South Vietnamese people. According to the "New York Times," 73 percent of the 320 million U.S. dollars in "aid" to South Vietnam in 1955 was spent on the training and equipment of the army.
    In order to strengthen its position of strength in South Vietnam, the United States is making every effort to eliminate French interests in South Vietnam. In April of this year, the United States directed the Ngo Dinh Diem group to launch a war, trying to annex or eliminate those sectarian troops in South Vietnam that were connected with French forces. The result of the long-term mixed war was: countless villages were burned down, rice fields were barren, and hundreds of thousands of farmers were displaced. South Vietnam's agricultural economy has therefore suffered serious damage. In the cities, it also caused chaos and unrest. The French newspaper "Liberation" said: "Saigon suffered more disasters in just one week of power struggle war than in the seven-year war." On April 28 alone, nearly 1,000 residents were killed or injured, and 20,000 people were made homeless.
    American companies with strong capital have regarded South Vietnam as a paradise for extracting huge profits. France's economic position in South Vietnam, like its political and military aspects, has been weakened and replaced by the United States. In 1954, U.S. commodity exports to South Vietnam increased by more than 360 million piastres compared with 1953, while French commodities decreased by more than 290 million piastres during the same period. Since the beginning of this year, French goods have been squeezed out more fiercely. AFP said on November 22: French commercial activities in South Vietnam, which accounted for 70 percent of Vietnam's total trade in 1954, "have fallen to 30 percent in 1955, and will further decline in 1956." And the United States' plundering of South Vietnam's rubber and other materials last year reached 500 million piastres, which is 20 percent more than South Vietnam's total exports to France in the same year. At the end of last year, the United States forced France to hand over the power to issue currency and manage financial activities, which were previously owned by French banks, to the U.S.-controlled South Vietnam Bank. This year, the United States has controlled South Vietnam's trade and market through direct "aid." Many French companies have withdrawn their funds, and many large enterprises have been shut down. Some well-known French companies, such as "Indochina Brewing Company," "Indochina Transportation Company," "Charna Department Store," and many properties of Banque de l'Indochine, have successively fallen into the hands of Americans.
    The influx of American commodities into South Vietnam is not only squeezing out France, but also making it impossible for local South Vietnamese industry and commerce to continue to survive. Many of the already very weak South Vietnamese national industries and handicrafts that used to play a considerable role in the South Vietnamese economy have been squeezed out. According to South Vietnamese newspapers, the commercial market in Saigon-Cholon is currently in a state of semi-paralysis. South Vietnam's textile industry has been shut down because it cannot compete with the large number of American imported cloths and textiles. The crisis in the textile industry threatens the lives of 100,000 workers in South Vietnam. The American canned fish flooding the market puts the fish processing industries in Phu Quoc, Phan Thiet, Nha Trang, Ba Ria, Chau Doc, and Bac Lieu, which are rich in fish products, in danger of shutdown. Other industries are also equally depressed. The Paris "International Forum" wrote: "At present, any attempt to revive national production is inevitably doomed to failure. Because the strangulation power of American economic expansionism is more dangerous than any other expansionism."
    This practice of the United States in South Vietnam has brought profound suffering to the South Vietnamese people. With the closure of many large enterprises and the bankruptcy of industry and handicrafts, according to the Paris "International Forum," the "number of unemployed people in South Vietnam has increased to an alarming level." There are 60,000 people without work in the Saigon-Cholon area alone. Those who have jobs also have a difficult life.
  "New Saigon Newspaper" said, "The cost of living has increased because the prices of goods have risen. But income remains the same. As a result, people's lives are becoming more and more unbearable." "Morning Post" wrote that many people work hard all their lives but cannot get enough to eat or wear; they have no place to live, so they sleep on sidewalks, under bridges, and in the corners of the market, "taking the sky as a tent and the ground as a mattress." "Due to the inability to find jobs, many strong people have no choice but to become beggars, and many girls have no other choice but to become prostitutes." Those North Vietnamese residents (mostly Catholics) who were abducted to South Vietnam by the Ngo Dinh Diem group under the direction of the United States are living even more miserably. In July of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem group launched a "self-sufficiency" movement among them, forcing many young people to become cannon fodder or to work as coolies on rubber plantations. The rest were mostly driven to the swampy areas west of Saigon or to the uninhabited depths of the forest, relying on collecting wild fruits and tubers to survive. Most of those who wander in the cities beg on the streets. Many people have tasted this painful life and asked to return to North Vietnam, but Ngo Dinh Diem wants them to "pray for the health of the Pope and American Cardinal Spellman, and reward them with a paradise-like life"!
    However, more and more South Vietnamese people have begun to realize who is bringing suffering to them. They are fighting for their right to survival, for the improvement of their lives, and resolutely opposing the policies pursued by the United States in South Vietnam. Together with the North Vietnamese people, they are fighting for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    美国控制下的南越经济
    萧光
    今年三月，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开声明美国要支持吴庭艳集团建立“比较健全的经济状况”。但是，近一年来的情况表明：南越的经济不仅丝毫没有好起来的迹象，而且正日益恶化。美联社在十一月二十一日也承认，南越“更加冷酷的情况”是：“日益减少的生产，上涨的物价和日益增长的失业人数。”
    南越经济的恶化首先表现在农业生产方面。南越一向是亚洲盛产大米的地方，过去年产量达五、六百万吨，每年能输出大米一百五十万吨；现在却不得不从国外进口大米。法新社十月十七日在谈到南越米荒的时候说：“西贡大米供应的困难与日俱增。几天前储藏即已告罄。大米已经在大部分商店里绝迹。”南越的报纸说，西贡的许多米店有市无货，人民买粮食非常困难。在对外贸易方面，逆差数字正在增大。据法新社报道，今年上半年南越输入为四十六亿四千万皮阿斯特（南越货币），输出为十二亿零八百万皮阿斯特。输入的价值几乎是输出的四倍。目前由于大米的严重缺乏影响输出，南越对外贸易的赤字还将增加。美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”预料：南越在一九五五年的进口约三亿美元，而它的出口只有五千万美元。由于生活必需品的缺乏，引起了货币贬值，物价飞涨。十月底，吴庭艳集团规定美元和皮阿斯特的比值为一比三十五。在这以前，一个美元约合二十多个皮阿斯特。今年六月，每两黄金值三千六百皮阿斯特。十月，已涨到四千一百多皮阿斯特。大米由每一百公斤六百皮阿斯特暴涨到一千二、三百皮阿斯特。其他日用必需品的价格也普遍上涨。“纽约时报”驻西贡记者承认：“物价高昂，而通货膨胀的威胁正在使这里的美国和越南的官员们为之苦恼。”
    南越经济情况的恶化，是美国在南越进行疯狂掠夺和推行战争政策所造成的。停战以后不久，美国就在南越为吴庭艳大事装备和训练军队，准备新的战争和建立军事恐怖统治，加强镇压人民。不久前，吴庭艳集团已建成四个“有战斗准备的”重装师；现在又在建立它的空军和着手改编“近代化”的轻装师。与此同时，美国还计划为吴庭艳建立人数众多的“后备部队”和“地方警察部队”。扩军备战的庞大开支占吴庭艳集团财政预算的绝大部分，大大加重了南越人民的负担。据“纽约时报”透露，在一九五五年美国“援助”南越的三亿二千万美元中间，百分之七十三是花费在军队的训练和装备上面。
    美国为了加强它在南越的实力地位，正竭力排除法国在南越的利益。今年四月，美国指使吴庭艳集团发动战争，力图吞并或消灭南越那些和法国势力有联系的教派军队。长期混战的结果是：无数的乡村被焚毁、稻田荒芜和几十万农民流离失所。南越的农业经济因此蒙受严重损害。在城市里，同样引起了混乱和不安。法国“解放报”说：“西贡在仅仅一个星期的争权夺利战争中比在七年战争中所受的灾难还大。”只在四月二十八日一天，就有近一千名居民伤亡，两万人无家可归。
    资本雄厚的美国公司，已把南越当作榨取巨额利润的乐园。法国在南越的经济地位，如它在政治和军事方面一样，已经被美国削弱和代替。在一九五四年，美国商品对南越的出口比一九五三年增加了三亿六千多万皮阿斯特，而同期的法国商品则减少了二亿九千多万皮阿斯特。今年以来法国商品被排挤得更激烈。法新社在十一月二十二日说：一九五四年占越南总贸易额百分之七十的法国在南越的商业活动，“一九五五年已降到百分之三十，一九五六年还会进一步下降”。而美国在掠取南越的橡胶等物资方面，去年就已达五亿皮阿斯特，比同年南越对法国的出口总额多百分之二十。去年年底，美国迫使法国将过去法国银行拥有的货币发行权和金融活动管理权交给美国控制的南越银行。今年，美国又以直接“援助”的手段控制了南越的贸易和市场。许多法国公司抽走了资金，许多大企业已经停顿。一些著名的法国企业如“印度支那酿酒公司”、“印度支那运输公司”、“夏尔纳百货公司”以及东方汇理银行的许多房产，都已先后落在美国人的手里了。
    美国商品汹涌进入南越，不仅排挤着法国，还使当地的南越工商业无法继续生存。本来已经非常微弱的南越民族工业和过去在南越经济中相当起作用的手工业，有不少已经被挤垮了。据南越报纸透露：目前，西贡—堤岸的商业市场已在半停顿的状态中。南越的纺织工业由于竞争不过美国大量进口的布匹和纺织品，已陷于停顿状态。纺织业的危机威胁着南越十万职工的生活。充斥市场的美国鱼罐头，使得渔产丰富的富国、藩切、芽庄、巴地、朱笃和薄辽等地的渔产加工业面临停工的危险。其他行业也是同样的不景气。巴黎“国际论坛”写道：“在目前，任何复活民族生产的意图都是不可避免地注定要失败的。因为，美国经济扩张主义的绞杀力比不管什么其他的扩张主义都危险。”
    美国在南越的这种作法，给南越人民带来了深重苦难。随着许多大企业的关闭，工业和手工业的破产，据巴黎“国际论坛”说，南越“失业的人数增加到令人不安的程度”。光在西贡—堤岸地区就有六万人没有工作。有工作的人，生活也很困难。
  “新西贡报”说，“生活费用已经增加，因为货物的价格上涨。而收入仍然照旧。结果，人民的生活愈来愈难以忍受了。”“晨报”写道，许多人劳累终生而吃不饱穿不暖；他们没有住处，就睡在人行道上、桥洞下和市场的角落里，“把天空当帐子，把地面当褥子”。“由于找不到职业，许多身体健壮的人只有沦为乞丐，许多女孩子除了当娼妓以外别无其他办法”。那些被美国指使吴庭艳集团劫运到南越去的北越居民（大多是天主教徒），生活更加悲惨。今年七月，吴庭艳集团在他们中间发起一个“生活自给”运动，迫使许多青年去当炮灰或是投身到橡胶种植场去做苦工。剩下的多被赶到西贡以西的沼泽地带或是渺无人烟的森林深处，靠采集野果和块根来过活。流落在城市里的大都行乞街头。许多人尝够了这种痛苦的生活，要求返回北越，吴庭艳却要他们“祷告教皇和美国红衣主教斯培尔曼的健康，并赏赐给他们天堂般的生活”！
    但是，愈来愈多的南越人民，已开始认识到究竟是谁为他们带来了苦难。他们正为争取自己的生存权利，争取改善他们的生活，坚决地反对美国在南越所推行的政策。他们和北越人民一起，正为争取全部实现日内瓦协议，实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。
