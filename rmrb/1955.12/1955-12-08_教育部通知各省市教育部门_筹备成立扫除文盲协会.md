Xinhua News Agency, December 7th – The Ministry of Education issued a notice on the 6th to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, tasking them to, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's "Instructions on Strengthening Farmers' Spare-Time Cultural Education" of June 2, 1955, and in conjunction with local specific conditions, begin preparing for the establishment of illiteracy eradication associations.

The notice said: With the rapid development of national industrial construction and the agricultural cooperative movement, the work of eliminating illiteracy must be accelerated and vigorously carried out. Since illiteracy eradication is a work with extremely broad mass participation, in order to complete this major and strategically significant historical task, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize social forces and mass forces to assist the government in carrying out this movement in order to achieve the desired results. Based on the experience of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries in eliminating illiteracy, as well as the preliminary experience already gained by the Heilongjiang Provincial Education Department in focusing on piloting illiteracy eradication associations, the establishment of illiteracy eradication associations is an effective organizational form for broadly mobilizing and organizing social forces and mass forces to assist the government in carrying out illiteracy eradication work.

    教育部通知各省市教育部门
    筹备成立扫除文盲协会
    新华社七日讯　教育部六日发出一个通知给各省、市的教育厅和教育局，责成各厅、局根据一九五五年六月二日国务院“关于加强农民业余文化教育的指示”的精神，结合当地具体情况，着手筹备成立扫除文盲协会。
    通知说：随着国家工业建设和农业合作化运动的迅速发展，扫除文盲工作必须加快速度大力地进行。由于扫除文盲是一项具有极其广泛群众性的工作，要完成这一重大的、具有战略意义的历史任务，必须大力动员社会力量和群众力量，协助政府来开展这一运动，才会收到预期的效果。根据苏联和各人民民主国家扫除文盲的经验，以及我国黑龙江省教育厅重点试办扫除文盲协会已经取得的初步经验，成立扫除文盲协会是广泛动员、组织社会力量和群众力量，协助政府开展扫除文盲工作的有效组织形式。
