    Rapidly Improve the Publication Work of Books on Agricultural Cooperativization
    Ma Lin
    According to incomplete statistics, from January 1954 to August 1955, thirty-one publishing houses across the country published a total of 294 books on the socialist transformation of agriculture. These books played a certain role in the cooperativization movement, but there were also many problems.
    First, analyzing from the perspective of publication categories, it can be seen that the planning for the publication of books in this area is quite insufficient. This is manifested in the following two points: First, the vast majority of the books published are popular books, which is certainly necessary and needs to be further strengthened; however, very few theoretical works have been published. This fails to help our cadres understand the inherent laws of the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country. Second, there are too few books introducing, interpreting, and researching certain specialized issues in the agricultural cooperativization movement. For example, improving and enhancing the leadership of county and district cadres over agricultural producers' cooperatives is an important task in promoting the agricultural cooperativization movement. However, only two such books have been published. To run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, it is necessary to do a good job in the work of party and Communist Youth League branches in rural areas, but only nine publishing houses have published eleven books on this aspect. With the further development and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the issues of how to organize surplus labor, improve farming techniques, improve soil, construct water conservancy projects, reclaim wasteland, and combine agriculture with animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and diversified management are becoming increasingly urgent. However, some of these areas have only one or two books, and some have none at all. All of these situations indicate that the publication of books on agricultural cooperativization has not been closely integrated with the actual movement, and many important issues raised in real life have not been fully reflected in publications.
    In order to strengthen the publication work of books on agricultural cooperativization, a comprehensive plan must be made. All publishing houses should, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, grasp the overall picture of the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the existing problems, and organize the publication of books in a more planned manner. We must not only give more consideration to the publication of popular books needed by the broad masses of cadres and people, but also to the publication of theoretical and research books needed by more senior cadres; we must not only publish books that explain the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives and interpret the party's policy of agricultural cooperativization, but also publish books that interpret and study specialized issues of great significance in the agricultural cooperativization movement. Publication work should comprehensively serve the agricultural cooperativization movement.
    Secondly, from the perspective of the correctness of the content of the books, there are also many serious shortcomings and errors.
    What deserves our special attention is that right-leaning ideas in the agricultural cooperativization movement are also reflected in these books. This is mainly manifested in two aspects: One is the failure to see the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. For example, "Implement the Policy of Active Leadership and Steady Progress in Running Cooperatives," published by the Popular Reading Material Publishing House in September 1955, emphasized that "we cannot overestimate the consciousness of the peasants" and that cadres and activists are "not familiar enough" with agricultural cooperativization, focusing on criticizing the so-called "blind large-scale development" that "disregards the level of mass consciousness and possible conditions" and describing the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives as a matter of the "future." This only sees the wavering of the thinking of a few wealthy peasants, and ignores the increasingly high socialist enthusiasm of the majority of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants. At the same time, it only sees the shortcomings of cadres, and does not see that the agricultural cooperativization movement over the past few years has cultivated and will continue to cultivate a large number of cadres and activists who are relatively familiar with agricultural cooperativization work under the leadership of the party. Another example is "Strengthening the Party's Leadership Over Rural Work," published by the Sichuan People's Publishing House in July 1955, which believes that "the main task of cooperativization at present is no longer to develop quantity, but should focus on improving quality and should comprehensively turn to consolidation work," which more clearly shows an incorrect assessment of the current agricultural cooperativization movement. The other is only seeing or exaggerating the shortcomings of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and ignoring the achievements and advantages in the agricultural cooperativization movement. For example, "Several Issues on Consolidating Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," published by the South China People's Publishing House in April 1955, in the "Editor's Note," emphasizes throughout that "the original more than 1,000 old cooperatives" "have not improved their management level," "the chaotic production phenomena in the newly established more than 12,400 new cooperatives have not been completely overcome," "leaders and cadres at all levels lack experience in consolidating cooperatives and do not go deep into the cooperatives," and the thinking of some members "is still not consolidated," "and fluctuations have occurred," etc., and does not recognize that, in the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, achievements are the main aspect, the broad masses are active, many cadres have been tempered, the party's guidelines and policies are clear, and experience is being accumulated. As a result, this book only emphasizes that consolidating cooperatives "still requires arduous work," but entrusts the work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives to the "future," believing that it is not a matter for "this year" (i.e., 1955).
    Another prominent shortcoming in the content of agricultural cooperativization books is the lack of analysis of the objective possibilities of agricultural cooperativization in our country. The "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" issued by the Party Central Committee in 1953 pointed out that the "possibility" of the party's policy of leading peasants to gradually transition to socialism "is determined by the following factors: first, the leadership of the people's government and socialist industry headed by the working class; second, the peasants have been liberated and have obtained land under the leadership of the working class, and therefore can believe in the correctness of the leadership of the working class; third, the working class and the peasant masses have common interests, and the poor peasants and middle peasants have common interests, and all these common interests are that everyone strives or hopes to get rid of capitalist exploitation..." However, the vast majority of books on the socialist transformation of agriculture and almost all books on agricultural producers' cooperatives have either failed to conduct a more careful analysis of this instruction, or have not mentioned it at all. The vast majority of books are limited to analyzing the necessity of agricultural cooperativization from the backwardness of the small-peasant economy, while ignoring the objective possibility of transforming the small-peasant economy from the political and economic conditions of the entire country.
    The Party is the leading force of agricultural cooperativization, and the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants will inevitably rise under the leadership of the Party. These views should be developed in books on agricultural cooperativization. However, in the books that have been published, the vast majority have also neglected these two important aspects: the Party's unlimited prestige among the peasant masses and the explanation of the rising socialist enthusiasm of the peasants from the viewpoint of class analysis. Only a few books have conducted simple class analysis, and some books, when describing the ideological wavering of some peasants in the agricultural cooperativization movement, completely ignored class analysis, did not point out which class of peasants was wavering, and did not point out that more peasants were resolutely demanding to organize or join agricultural producers' cooperatives. Regarding the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants, although it is mentioned in many books, some books equate the mutual assistance and cooperation of the small-peasant economy with the two kinds of enthusiasm of individual production, and do not point out that the enthusiasm of the working peasants for mutual assistance and cooperation and for taking the socialist road is the dominant aspect, the mainstream of development.
    Some books also neglect the role of state support in the development of agricultural cooperativization. For example, "Answers to Questions on Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," published by the Popular Reading Material Publishing House in July 1955, and most of the books titled "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," do not mention this point at all. Some books simply describe the state's support as "combination" and "connection." For example, "How to Run Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Well," published by the Gansu People's Publishing House in December 1954, describes the relationship between agricultural producers' cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives, credit organizations, state-owned farms, and agricultural technology promotion stations as "strengthening connections with all aspects," rather than specifying that these are the state's support for agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some books describe the content of state support too narrowly, often only taking agricultural loans, technology promotion, and the supply of new agricultural implements as state support projects, and not comprehensively pointing out the state's multi-faceted support for agricultural cooperativization. For example, it does not point out that supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural producers' cooperatives sign combination contracts, carry out other commodity exchanges that are beneficial to agricultural producers' cooperatives, reduce the capitalist intermediate exploitation suffered by agricultural producers' cooperatives through unified purchase and sale, build urban and rural transportation roads, train and cultivate cadres for agricultural cooperativization, etc., are also the state's support for agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    The state's implementation of socialist industrialization is the greatest support for agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, many books do not emphasize this point. Many books are limited to pointing out that socialist industrialization can provide agriculture with modern agricultural machinery in the future and can provide new agricultural implements and other means of production at present. Most books do not point out that socialist industrialization can provide agricultural producers' cooperatives with abundant production and living consumer goods with constantly reduced prices, and can continuously enrich the state's financial strength so that the state increases financial support for agricultural cooperativization. As for the point that every development of industrialization further promotes the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants, almost all books have not pointed this out. Some books, such as "Questions and Answers on Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives," published by the Jiangsu People's Publishing House in December 1954, even only point out the support of the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives for national industrialization, and do not point out the support of industrialization for agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    From the above, it shows that the ideological nature of books on agricultural cooperativization still needs to be further improved.
    The high tide of agricultural cooperativization has arrived in the whole country, and Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" have clearly indicated the Party's policy in this social reform with great historical significance. All relevant publishing houses should conduct a serious review of their publications based on the Party's policies. The above-mentioned shortcomings in content should be revised as necessary in reprints, and a comprehensive plan should be made for future publication work, so that publication work can better serve this great movement.

    迅速改进农业合作化书籍的出版工作
    马林
    据不完全的统计，从一九五四年一月到一九五五年八月，全国三十一家出版社共出版了关于农业社会主义改造的书籍二百九十四种。这些书籍在合作化运动中都起了一定的作用，但是也有不少问题。
    首先，从出版种类上进行分析，就可以看出这方面书籍的出版工作，计划性是很不够的，这表现在以下两点：第一，已经出版的书籍绝大部分是通俗书籍，这当然是必要的，并且需要继续加强它；但关于理论性的著作却出版极少。这样，就不能帮助我们干部来了解我国农业的社会主义改造的内在规律。第二，有关介绍、阐释和研究农业合作化运动中某些专门问题的书，也显得太少。例如，改进和提高县区干部对农业生产合作社的领导工作，是推进农业合作化运动中一项重要的事情。但是这类书一共只出版二种。办好农业生产合作社就必须做好农村中党和团的支部工作，而这方面的书，只有九个出版社出版了十一种。随着农业生产合作社进一步的发展和巩固，日益迫切地提出了如何在农业生产合作社中组织剩余劳动力、提高耕作技术、改良土壤、兴修水利、开垦荒地以及农业和畜牧业、林业、副业的多种经营结合的问题，而这些方面的书籍，有的只有一、二种，有的根本没有。这些情况都说明，农业合作化书籍的出版工作，还没有密切地和实际运动结合起来，实际生活中提出来的许多重要问题，还没有在出版物中得到充分反映。
    为要加强关于农业合作化书籍的出版工作，必须进行全面的规划。各出版社都应该在各级党委领导之下，掌握农业合作化运动发展的全貌和存在的问题，更有计划地组织书籍的出版工作。既要更多地照顾到广大干部和群众需要的通俗的书籍出版，也要照顾到较高级干部需要的理论性和研究性书籍的出版；既要出版阐释农业生产合作社优越性，解释党的农业合作化政策的书籍，也要出版阐释和研究在农业合作化运动中有重要意义的专门问题的书籍；出版工作应当全面地为农业合作化运动服务。
    其次，从书籍内容的正确性方面来看，也包含着不少严重的缺点和错误。
    特别值得我们注意的是，农业合作化运动中的右倾思想，在这些书籍中也有所反映。这主要表现在两个方面：一种是看不到农业合作化高潮的到来。例如，通俗读物出版社一九五五年九月出版的“贯彻积极领导稳步前进的办社方针”，就是强调“不能把农民的觉悟估计的过高”，强调干部和积极分子，对于农业合作化“还是不够熟悉的”，着重地批评所谓“不顾群众觉悟程度和可能条件”的“盲目地大发展”，把发展农业生产合作社说成“未来”的事情。这就是只看到少数富裕农民思想动摇的一面，忽视了多数的贫农和新老中农中间的下中农的社会主义积极性的日益高涨。同时，也只看到干部有着这些那些缺点的一面，而看不到几年来的农业合作化运动在党领导之下已经培养了并且还要在运动中继续培养一大批比较熟悉农业合作化工作的干部和积极分子。又如四川人民出版社一九五五年七月出版的“加强党对农村工作的领导”，认为“目前合作化的主要任务，已经不是发展数量，而应集中注意于提高质量，应当全面地转向巩固工作”，更明显地表明了对当前农业合作化运动的估计错误。另一种是只看到或夸大了农业生产合作社的缺点，忽视了农业合作化运动中的成绩和优点。例如华南人民出版社一九五五年四月出版的“巩固农业生产合作社的几个问题”，在“编者的话”中通篇都是强调“原有的一千多个老社”，“经营管理水平都没有什么提高”，“新建成的一万二千四百多个新社，生产上的混乱现象，仍未完全克服”，“各级领导和干部既缺乏巩固社的经验，又不深入合作社”，部分社员思想“仍不巩固”，“发生波动”等等，而没有认识到，在农业合作化运动的发展中，成绩是主要的，广大群众是积极的，许多干部是经过锻炼的，党的方针政策是明确的，经验是在积累着的。结果，这本书就只强调，巩固社“还必须进行艰苦的工作”，却把发展农业生产合作社的工作寄之于“将来”，认为不是“今年”（即一九五五年）的事。
    农业合作化书籍在内容方面另一个突出的缺点，是对于我国农业合作化的客观可能性缺少分析。党中央一九五三年发布的“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”曾经指出：党关于领导农民逐步过渡到社会主义的政策的“可能性是由以下因素所决定的：第一是以工人阶级为首的人民政权和社会主义工业的领导；第二是农民在工人阶级领导下获得了解放和土地，因而能够相信工人阶级领导的正确性；第三是工人阶级和农民群众有共同的利益以及贫农和中农有共同的利益，而这一切共同的利益就是大家都力求或希望摆脱资本主义的剥削……。”可是，绝大多数关于农业社会主义改造的书籍和几乎全部关于农业生产合作社的书籍，对于这一指示，有些未进行较仔细的分析，有些甚至完全不提。绝大多数书籍，都只限于从小农经济的落后性来分析农业合作化的必要，而忽视了从整个国家政治经济条件来分析小农经济改造的客观可能。
    党是农业合作化的领导力量，广大农民在党的领导下，社会主义积极性必然日益高涨起来。这些观点应该在农业合作化书籍中得到发挥。可是，在已经出版的书籍中，绝大多数对于党在农民群众中的无限威信以及从阶级分析观点说明农民社会主义积极性的高涨这两个重要方面，也大都忽略了。只有很少几本书进行了简单的阶级分析，而有些书叙述某些农民在农业合作化运动中思想动摇的情形时，完全忽视了阶级分析，没有指明究竟是农民中那一阶层思想动摇，更没有指明更多的农民是在坚决要求组织或加入农业生产合作社。关于农民社会主义的积极性，虽然在很多书籍中都谈到了，但一部分书籍把小农经济的互助合作和个体生产的两种积极性平列起来，没有指出劳动农民互助合作积极性和走社会主义道路是主导的一面，是发展中的主流。
    一些书籍还忽视了国家支援在发展农业合作化中的作用。像通俗读物出版社一九五五年七月出版的“农业生产合作社问题解答”以及大部分以“农业生产合作社问答”为题的书籍，都完全未提到这一点。有的书籍把国家的支援简单地说成是“结合”、“联系”。如甘肃人民出版社一九五四年十二月出版的“怎样办好农业生产合作社”，就把农业生产合作社和供销合作社、信贷组织、国营农场、农业技术推广站的关系说成是“加强和各方面的联系”，而不是指明这些就是国家对农业生产合作社的支援。有的书对国家支援的内容说得过于狭窄，往往只把农业贷款、技术推广、供给新式农具等作为国家支援的项目，而不全面地指出国家对农业合作化的多方面的支援。例如，没有指出供销合作社和农业生产合作社订立结合合同、进行其他有利农业生产合作社的商品交换、通过统购统销减少农业生产合作社所受的资本主义中间剥削，修筑城乡交通道路，为农业合作化训练和培养干部等等，也是国家对农业生产合作社的支援。
    国家实行社会主义工业化是对农业生产合作社的最大的支援。但是，许多书籍没有强调这一点。许多书籍都只限于指出社会主义工业化能在将来提供农业以现代化的农业机器以及在目前能提供新式农具等生产资料。多数书籍都没有指明社会主义工业化能够提供农业生产合作社以丰富的、并且不断地降低售价的生产和生活消费用品，能够不断地充裕国家财政力量而使国家增加对农业合作化的财政支援。至于工业化的每一发展，都更加推动了农民社会主义积极性这一点，几乎所有书籍都未予指明。有的书籍，如江苏人民出版社一九五四年十二月出版的“农业生产合作社问答”，甚至只指出发展农业生产合作社对国家工业化的支援，而不指出工业化对农业生产合作社的支援。
    由上所述，这就说明关于农业合作化书籍的思想性还需要进一步提高。
    全国农业合作化的高潮已经到来，毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，已经明确地指示了党在这个具有伟大历史意义的社会改革中的方针。各有关出版社应该根据党的方针对自己出版物进行一次认真的审查。对上述内容方面的缺点，在再版时予以必要的修订，对今后的出版工作应该进行全面的规划，以便出版工作更好地为这一伟大运动服务。
