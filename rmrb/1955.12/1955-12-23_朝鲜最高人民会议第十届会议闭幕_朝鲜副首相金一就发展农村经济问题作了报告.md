Pyongyang newspapers today published the report "On Further Developing the Rural Economy" delivered by Kim Il, Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the Tenth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly on December 20th.

Kim Il said that since the adoption of the plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy from 1954 to 1956, the Korean people have achieved glorious victories in the struggle for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war in nearly two years.

Kim Il first briefly described the achievements in the industrial sector. He said that the industrial production sector has significantly exceeded the 1949 level. In the first half of 1955, the total industrial output of state-owned and cooperative enterprises increased to two and a half times that of the first half of 1953.

Kim Il then described the achievements in agriculture and water conservancy. He said that this year, the government vigorously promoted large-scale irrigation projects, expanding the irrigated area by about 50,000 chōbu (1 chōbu is approximately 15 Chinese mu) in two years. In the past two years, about 38,000 chōbu of wasteland and fallow land have been reclaimed and restored. This year, the planting area of ​​major crops was completed at 100.2 percent, and the total planting area increased by more than 6,000 chōbu compared to 1953.

As of the end of August this year, there were 11,543 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 45.1 percent of all peasant households, and the cultivated land area of the cooperatives accounting for 44.8 percent of all cultivated land.

When talking about the government's plan for developing agriculture in 1956, Kim Il said that the government stipulated that the investment in agriculture in 1956 would increase by 26.7 percent compared to the investment in agriculture stipulated in the Three-Year Plan for 1956, that is, an increase of more than 3.2 billion won (Korean currency). In 1956, the total grain output will reach 2.73 million tons, and the output of other agricultural products such as vegetables, potatoes, and fruits, as well as animal husbandry and sericulture, will also increase substantially.

When talking about the development of agricultural production cooperatives, Kim Il said that in order to promote agricultural development and socialist transformation, the government believes that consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives is one of the most important tasks at present. He said that today, the desire of individual farmers to join cooperatives is higher than ever before. Based on this realistic condition, we are carrying out the work of appropriately developing the number of cooperatives.

    金一接着叙述了农业、水利方面的成就。他说，在今年，政府大力促进大规模的灌溉工程，两年之间扩充灌溉面积约五万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。在过去两年间，开垦和恢复了约三万八千町步荒地和休耕地。今年主要农作物播种面积完成百分之一百零点二，而总播种面积比一九五三年增加了六千多町步。
