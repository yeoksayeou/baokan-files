    Jordanian People Oppose Baghdad Pact
    Cui Qi
    The political situation in Jordan is currently tense as Western countries are eager to pull Jordan into the Baghdad Pact. On December 14, the Mufti government was forced to resign, and a new government headed by Magali came to power. However, after only five days, King Hussein of Jordan announced the dissolution of the parliament, and the Magali government also resigned. These events reflect the sharp struggle between the Jordanian people and patriotic individuals against Western aggressive forces.
    As everyone knows, Western countries have been particularly active in Jordan in recent months. In November, the United States openly stated that it "hoped" Jordan could join the Baghdad Pact. At the same time, the United States also instructed Turkish President Bayar to "visit" Jordan in an attempt to win it over. However, due to the Jordanian people's strong opposition to this colonial aggression plan, the hopes of the United States and Western countries were not realized. Under the influence of the Jordanian people, the Mufti government repeatedly declared its unwillingness to join the Baghdad Pact. Not long ago, Mufti said that Jordan's participation in such a treaty would be contrary to Jordan's national interests, and he would rather resign than agree to Jordan's participation in the Baghdad Pact. Even within the Arab Legion, the main Jordanian force controlled by Britain, there were many patriotic officers who opposed Jordan's participation in the Baghdad Pact, advocating for strengthening unity among Arab countries.
    In this situation, Western countries became frantic and determined to adopt open intervention methods to suppress the wishes of the Jordanian people, attempting to impose the will of Western countries on Jordan. On December 6, shortly after the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact member states' Prime Ministers' Conference, British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer suddenly flew to Amman, the capital of Jordan. He brought a "plan" and demanded to "talk" with the Jordanian government. According to Western news agencies, the content of this plan was: first, Britain was prepared to "abolish" the unequal British-Jordanian treaty signed in 1948, and replace it with a new treaty similar to the current British-Iraqi treaty; second, Britain was prepared to expand its "aid" to Jordan. Then, Templer demanded a price: asking Jordan to sell its independence, sovereignty, and national interests to join the Baghdad Pact. He also threatened that if it did not, Britain would stop all "aid" to the Jordanian forces.
    It was due to Templer's rude intervention that the Mufti government was forced to resign. Templer did not seem to shy away from this point. To achieve this goal, he had extended his "visit" to Jordan, and waited until December 14, when he personally saw the Magali government, which advocated joining the Baghdad Pact, come to power before he left Jordan.
    According to the United Press, Templer also "personally participated in the reorganization of the Arab Legion headquarters during his stay in Jordan, thereby paving the way for Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact." At the same time, Jordanian Deputy Chief of Staff Ahmed Chungdi was dismissed. In addition, more than forty Jordanian officers will also be announced "retired." These were clearly not accidental.
    However, the Jordanian people cannot allow Britain and Western countries to manipulate their destiny at will. They saw through the great fraud of Templer's "plan." For Jordan, the example of Iraq is a lesson. Now, the British-Iraqi treaty signed in 1930 has been "abolished," but the new British-Iraqi treaty more seriously infringes on Iraq's sovereignty and strengthens Britain's control and occupation of Iraq. The result of Iraq signing a new British-Iraqi treaty and joining the Baghdad Pact has made its situation worse and its national crisis more profound. Therefore, the Jordanian people launched a heroic struggle, resolutely opposing the Magali government's attempt to accept Templer's "plan." The strength of the Jordanian people finally led to the quick collapse of the Magali government.
    The Jordanian people demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in this struggle. In recent days, large-scale demonstrations, strikes, and mass rallies have been held continuously in Amman, the capital of Jordan, and Nablus, the second largest city. In Jerusalem, a mass protest movement also broke out. The flames of the struggle against joining the Baghdad Pact are spreading throughout Jordan. Many patriots shed blood to defend the independence and security of their country.
    Now the people of the Middle East and Asian-African regions are concerned about the development of the political situation in Jordan. As everyone knows, Western countries' pressure on Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact is only part of their policy of promoting military blocs in the Middle East. The plan of Western countries is that after Jordan is pulled into the Baghdad Pact, it will create a surrounding situation of Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan against Syria and Lebanon, thereby facilitating them to further exert pressure on these two countries. Because of this, the struggle of the Jordanian people is also the struggle of the people of various countries in the Middle East, and it has received the sympathy and support of the public in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and other regions. We believe that as long as peace-loving people unite and are vigilant against the new conspiracies of imperialist forces, Jordanian patriots will be able to safeguard the independence and national interests of their country.

    约旦人民反对巴格达条约
    崔奇
    目前，由于西方国家急于想把约旦拉进巴格达条约，约旦的政治局势正处于紧张状态。十二月十四日，穆弗蒂政府被迫辞职，以马加利为首的新政府上台。但是仅仅过了五天，约旦国王侯赛尼又宣布解散议会，马加利政府也辞职了。这些事件反映着约旦人民和爱国人士同西方侵略势力之间的尖锐斗争。
    大家知道，近几个月来，西方国家对约旦的活动是特别紧张的。十一月间，美国曾公开表示，它“希望”约旦能够参加巴格达条约。同时，美国又授意土耳其总统拜亚尔“访问”约旦，进行拉拢。但是由于约旦人民强烈反对这种殖民国家的侵略计划，美国和西方国家的希望并未实现。在约旦人民的影响下，穆弗蒂政府曾一再宣布它不愿意参加巴格达条约。不久以前，穆弗蒂说过，约旦参加这种条约是和约旦的民族利益相违背的，他宁愿辞职也不同意约旦参加巴格达条约。甚至在英国所控制的约旦主要部队——阿拉伯军团内部，也有不少爱国军官，反对约旦参加巴格达集团，他们主张加强阿拉伯国家之间的团结。
    在这种情况下，西方国家竟丧心病狂起来，它们决心采取公开干涉的手段，压制约旦人民的愿望，企图把西方国家的意志强加在约旦身上。十二月六日，在巴格达条约参加国总理会议结束以后不久，英国帝国参谋总长田普勒突然飞到约旦的首都安曼。他带去了一项“计划”，要求和约旦政府
  “会谈”。据西方通讯社报道，这项计划的内容是：第一，英国准备“废除”一九四八年签订的英国—约旦不平等条约，而代之以类似目前的英国—伊拉克条约的新条约；第二，英国准备扩大对约旦的“援助”。然后，田普勒就要价了：要求约旦出卖它的独立主权和民族利益，参加巴格达条约。他并且威胁说，如果不然，英国就要停止对约旦部队的一切“援助”。
    就是由于田普勒这种粗暴的干涉活动，穆弗蒂政府被迫辞职。田普勒似乎也并不避讳这一点。为了达到这个目的，他曾经延长了“访问”约旦的期限，而一直等到十二月十四日，亲眼看到了主张加入巴格达条约的马加利政府上台以后，才离开了约旦。
    据合众社报道，田普勒逗留约旦期间，还“亲自参与了阿拉伯军团司令部的改组工作，从而为约旦加入巴格达条约铺平道路”。在这同时，约旦副总参谋长艾哈迈德·忠迪被免职。此外，还将有四十多名约旦军官宣布“退役”。这显然都不是偶然的。
    但是，约旦人民是不能容许英国和西方国家随心所欲地摆布他们的命运的。他们看透了田普勒“计划”的大骗局。对于约旦说来，伊拉克的例子恰恰是前车之鉴。现在，一九三○年签订的英国—伊拉克条约是“废除”了，但是新的英伊条约却更严重地侵犯了伊拉克的主权，加强了英国对伊拉克的控制和占领。伊拉克签订新的英伊条约和加入巴格达条约的结果，已使它的处境更加恶化，民族危机更加深重了。因此，约旦人民展开了英勇的斗争，坚决反对马加利政府企图接受田普勒“计划”的做法。约旦人民的力量，终于使马加利政府很快地倒台了。
    约旦人民在这次斗争中表现了高度的爱国主义精神。这几天来，约旦首都安曼和第二大城市纳布鲁斯都连续举行了大规模的示威游行、罢工和群众大会。在耶路撒冷，也爆发了群众性的抗议运动。反对参加巴格达条约的斗争火焰正在燃遍约旦全国。许多爱国者为了捍卫自己祖国的独立和安全而流了血。
    现在中近东和亚非地区人民都在关怀着约旦政治局势的发展。大家知道，西方国家压迫约旦加入巴格达条约，不过是它们在中近东推行军事集团政策的一部分。西方国家的计划是，把约旦拉入巴格达条约以后，就会造成土耳其、伊拉克和约旦对叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国的包围形势，从而便于它们向这两个国家进一步施加压力。正因为这样，约旦人民的斗争，也就是中近东各国人民的斗争，它受到了中近东和亚非其他地区各国公众的同情和支持。我们相信，只要爱好和平的人民团结一致，警惕帝国主义势力的新阴谋，约旦的爱国者是能够维护住国家的独立和民族利益的。
