Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: National coal mines had already exceeded the coal production plan for the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan by the end of November. As of December 20th, they had overproduced more than 5 million tons of raw coal. Among them, the four coal mines of Fushun, Fuxin, Huainan, and Jiaozuo alone produced more than 1.6 million tons of raw coal.

In the past three years, the cost of national state-owned coal mines has decreased year by year. If the cost savings of various coal mines are used to build new mines, five pairs of large shafts with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal can be constructed.

    全国煤矿超额完成前三年的产煤计划
    新华社二十四日讯　全国煤矿已经在十一月底超额完成第一个五年计划前三年的产煤计划。到十二月二十日为止，已超额生产五百多万吨原煤。其中，只是抚顺、阜新、淮南、焦作等四个煤矿，就多产了一百六十多万吨原煤。
    过去的三年来，全国国营煤矿的成本逐年降低。如把各个煤矿降低的成本费用来建设新井，可以建设五对年产六十万吨煤的大型竖井。
