    Eliminate the Pink Bollworm
    Eighty percent of cotton pink bollworms overwinter in cottonseed. The locations where cotton is concentrated—cotton collection stations, ginneries, farms, and the cotton warehouses of agricultural cooperatives—are precisely where pink bollworms overwinter. Therefore, concentrating efforts on controlling pink bollworms in these locations is of great importance in preventing damage to cotton in the coming year.
    According to an inspection by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, although the extent of pink bollworm damage in Shanxi Province's cotton-producing areas this year is less severe than in previous years, the damage is still very serious in some areas. For example, in the Linfen County ginnery, there were more than 1,100 pink bollworms in every pound of cotton debris under the cleaning machine. According to the factory's ginning volume this year, there are 310 million worms in the cotton debris alone; if all these worms overwinter safely, they could multiply to 15.5 billion next year, which is equivalent to an average of 6,000 pink bollworms per mu of cotton in Linfen County. What an alarming figure! The entire staff of the Linfen Ginnery recently launched a "Pink Bollworm Elimination Cleaning Sweep Day," determined to eliminate pink bollworms. Recently, the Jieyu County formed a thorough Pink Bollworm Prevention and Control Work Committee, formulated a prevention and control plan, and dispatched working groups to various townships to promote the work of pink bollworm prevention and control. The Quwo County Farm carried out turning and drying of seed cotton before it was put into storage, and the warehouses were also sprayed with pesticides. Now is the best time to eliminate pink bollworms, and leading bodies, cotton collection stations, ginneries, farms, etc. in various cotton-producing areas should seize the opportunity to eliminate pink bollworms.

    消灭红铃虫
    棉花红铃虫百分之八十是在棉籽中过冬，棉花集中的地点——收花站、轧花厂、农场和农业合作社的棉花仓库也正是红铃虫过冬的地点。因此，集中力量在这些地方防治红铃虫，对于防止红铃虫对来年棉花的为害，有很大作用。
    根据山西省农业厅的检查，今年山西省产棉区红铃虫为害程度虽比往年轻微，但是某些地区为害还是很严重。例如临汾县轧花厂的清花机下每一斤棉花碎屑中，就有一千一百多条红铃虫。按这个工厂今年的轧花数量推算起来，仅仅棉花碎屑中就有虫三亿一千万条；如果这些虫全部安全过冬，到明年就可繁殖到一百五十五亿条，等于临汾县每亩棉平均有红铃虫六千条。这是一个多么惊人的数字！临汾轧花厂全体职工最近发起了“消灭红铃虫清洁扫除运动日”，决心消灭红铃虫。最近解虞县组成了彻底防治红铃虫工作委员会，制定了防治计划，派出了工作组，赴各乡推动防治红铃虫的工作。曲沃县农场在籽棉入库前进行了翻晒，仓库也普遍喷射了药剂。目前正是消灭红铃虫的最好时期，各产棉区的领导机关、收花站、轧花厂、农场等应该抓紧时机，消灭红铃虫。
