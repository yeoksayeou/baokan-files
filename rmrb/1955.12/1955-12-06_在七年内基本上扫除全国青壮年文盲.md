    Basically Eliminate Illiteracy Among Young and Middle-Aged People Nationwide Within Seven Years

    With the comprehensive progress of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the widespread illiteracy among the masses of our people must also be accelerated, which is not only an objective need, but also fully possible. Especially today, when the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement has arrived, the work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas has been placed on the agenda even more urgently. According to calculations based on typical investigation materials from various regions, about 80 percent of young and middle-aged people in rural areas are illiterate, which is a serious obstacle to the agricultural cooperation movement. Taking accounting personnel as an example, some agricultural production cooperatives have been forced to use primitive methods such as drawing circles, lines, and tying knots to keep accounts due to the lack of accountants or qualified accountants, resulting in very chaotic financial management, which affects the production enthusiasm of the members and the consolidation of the cooperatives. Some bad elements have taken advantage of this gap to usurp accounting positions and sabotage agricultural production cooperatives. Similarly, the proportion of illiterates among the workers is generally about 50 percent. In some industries, such as coal mines and construction, it is even above 60 or 70 percent. This is incompatible with the requirements of modern industry. There are also a large number of illiterates among the urban working people. Therefore, launching a large-scale literacy campaign among workers and peasants is an extremely important task with strategic significance.

    In accordance with the requirements of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, it is necessary to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people nationwide during the Second Five-Year Plan period, that is, before 1962, or in other words, within the next seven years. The illiteracy in the organs, factories, mines and enterprises shall be removed as soon as possible. Now the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has made a decision to eliminate illiteracy among rural youth nationwide in seven years. The spirit and methods of this decision are very good and should be widely promoted.

    Some people, in view of the past lessons of correcting the tendency of blind advance, suspect that such a speed is too fast and whether it is another blind advance. They do not understand that the phenomenon of blind advance in the work of eliminating illiteracy in 1953 was corrected because at that time, in the absence of a high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in rural areas, without considering the actual situation, without estimating the subjective and objective conditions, without paying attention to steps, and without careful preparation, the situation was spread out all at once, with emphasis on quantity but not on quality, resulting in serious phenomena of "falling behind," "half-baked," and "returning to life"; and at the same time, the method of completely taking over the funding and teachers by the government was adopted, and the so-called "having people when needed, having money when needed" was overemphasized; At the same time, the role of rapid literacy methods was overemphasized, which affected the smooth development of the literacy campaign. This phenomenon of blind advance should of course be corrected. However, the subjective and objective conditions for eliminating illiteracy have now changed, and today's problem is no longer a problem of rash advance, but a problem that the thinking of many cadres lags behind the development of the situation, resulting in a conservative tendency.

    The whole country has to eliminate about 200 million illiterates within seven years. The vast majority of illiterates are in rural areas. Therefore, the task of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas is more arduous and requires greater efforts. But even in rural areas, we have the conditions to accomplish this task.

    What are the favorable conditions? The high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement has arrived, and profound changes have taken place in the rural economy. Due to economic needs, the masses of peasants have gradually realized that the cultural problem has become their own personal problem, and therefore their consciousness of learning culture has been greatly improved. At the same time, the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives has made it possible to uniformly arrange the production and study time of farmers, which guarantees the learning time of farmers. The strength of the teaching staff is also strong. At present, there are about 45 million non-illiterate young and middle-aged people in rural areas, and the ratio of non-illiterate to illiterate is one to four. Mobilizing non-illiterate people in rural areas to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy can form a large army of millions or even tens of millions of people to eliminate illiteracy. As junior high school and senior primary school graduates and other literate people will inevitably increase year by year in the future, the source of literacy teachers will continue to expand. These are all favorable conditions.

    Some cadres do not analyze these favorable conditions, but one-sidedly emphasize "the task is too heavy and there are too many difficulties," and have no confidence in completing the task. This is a tendency of conservatism. Leading organs at all levels should strengthen education for these cadres, help them recognize the favorable conditions in all aspects, recognize the possibility of accelerating the elimination of illiteracy in the next seven years, increase confidence, and actively lead this work.

    Of course, the difficult side should also be seen. Within seven years, eliminating about 200 million illiterates, the time is short, the task is heavy, and the difficulties are indeed not small. All the work in rural areas is very tense, and village cadres and activists are busy with their work, and their study time is limited; some women find it difficult to study with others because of family work; the distribution of teachers is uneven, and in educationally underdeveloped areas, there are relatively few literate people, these are also difficulties. It is also wrong not to see these difficulties, not to study the problems in the work and the ways to solve the problems in depth. Of course, one should never be afraid of these difficulties. For those who are willing to learn to read and write but cannot participate in the study of folk schools, methods such as "door-to-door" contracting teaching and guaranteeing learning can be adopted; the difficulties of village cadres and activists can be solved by reasonably arranging production, work and study time. The problem of uneven distribution of teachers can also be solved by mutual adjustment.

    In order to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy on schedule, it is necessary to implement comprehensive planning and strengthen leadership. Party and government leading organs at all levels should, according to the specific conditions of each region, formulate and implement practical and feasible literacy plans as soon as possible in accordance with the overall goal of basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people nationwide within seven years; and should make plans for developing formal spare-time education to prevent the occurrence of "returning to life" phenomenon, consolidate the existing knowledge of workers and peasants, and constantly improve their cultural level. The education departments of governments at all levels should be specifically responsible for the work of eliminating illiteracy, improve specialized management agencies, and guide the progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy in a timely manner. The Youth League has a special and important responsibility for eliminating illiteracy. In determining the literacy plan, mobilizing and organizing illiterates to participate in learning, mobilizing non-illiterates to participate in literacy work, etc., the Youth League committees at all levels should closely cooperate with the education departments and play an active role. Trade unions, women's federations and relevant departments at all levels should play their due role in the literacy campaign.

    The literacy campaign is another great movement under the leadership of the Party. It is not enough to rely on the call of the leading organs and the activities of a few people. It is necessary to implement the principle of "teaching the people by the people," mobilize the masses to educate the masses, and establish a large army of literacy, absorbing millions of people with culture to participate in this historical movement. There are many teaching forms for eliminating illiteracy, but there must be a strong team of mass teachers in order to use various teaching forms. If there are few teachers, only relatively concentrated teaching forms can be used; if there are millions of teachers, relatively decentralized teaching forms such as contracting teaching and guaranteeing learning can be widely adopted, so that illiterates who are willing to learn to read and write and have real difficulties can participate in learning, and accelerate the progress of eliminating illiteracy. In short, all kinds of methods must be adopted to educate the vast number of urban and rural intellectuals and all literate people to regard helping others to learn to read as their unshirkable responsibility and as their glorious duty.

    In order to make the literacy campaign a mass movement, it is not only necessary to take a series of organizational measures, but also to carry out large-scale publicity work, using all possible opportunities to publicize the significance and steps of eliminating illiteracy to cadres and the masses, seize the time, speed up the pace, mobilize all forces to support this work; and enable all illiterate people to consciously participate in learning and transform themselves into cultured people, so as to better participate in the cause of socialist construction.

### 在七年内基本上扫除全国青壮年文盲

    在七年内基本上扫除全国青壮年文盲
    随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的全面进展，我国人民群众中大量存在的文盲也必须加速扫除，这不但是客观的需要，而且有充分的可能。特别是在农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来的今天，农村中扫除文盲的工作更加迫切地排到日程上来了。据各地典型调查材料计算，在农村青壮年中，约有百分之八十人的是文盲，这是农业合作化运动的一个严重障碍。单就会计人才来说，一部分农业生产合作社由于没有会计或者没有称职的会计，甚至不得不用画圈、画道以及结绳等原始方法记账，财务管理非常混乱，影响了社员的生产情绪，影响了合作社的巩固。有一些坏分子利用这一空隙，窃取了会计职务，破坏农业生产合作社。同样，在职工群众中，文盲的比例一般也占百分之五十左右。有的产业如煤矿、建筑等还在百分之六、七十以上。这同现代工业的要求是不相适应的。城市劳动人民中也有大量的文盲。因此，在工农群众中开展大规模的扫除文盲运动，乃是一项极为重大的具有战略意义的任务。
    按照社会主义工业化和农业合作化的要求，必须在第二个五年计划期间，即在一九六二年以前，换句话说，也就是在今后七年内，基本上扫除全国青壮年文盲。机关、工厂、矿山、企业中的文盲，则应当尽先尽快地加以全部扫除。现在中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会做出决定，要在七年内扫除全国农村青年文盲，这个决定的精神和办法都很好，应该普遍地加以推行。
    有人因为鉴于过去纠正盲目冒进偏向的教训，怀疑这样的速度是不是太快，是不是又冒进了。他们不了解，一九五三年纠正扫除文盲工作中的盲目冒进现象，是因为当时在农村没有出现农业合作化运动高潮的情况下，不看实际情况，不估计主客观条件，不讲究步骤，没有周密的准备，就一下子把摊子铺开，重量不重质，造成了严重的“掉队”、“夹生”和“回生”的现象；并且对经费、师资采取了完全由政府包下来的办法，过分强调所谓“要人有人，要钱有钱”；同时也过分强调了速成识字法的作用，以致影响了扫除文盲工作的顺利开展。这种盲目冒进的现象当然应该纠正。然而现在扫除文盲的主客观条件已经发生了变化，今天的问题已经不是冒进的问题，而是有许多干部的思想落后于形势的发展，产生了保守倾向的问题了。
    全国要在七年之内扫除大约两亿左右的文盲。其中绝大多数文盲是在农村，因此，农村的扫除文盲任务更加艰巨，需要花费更大的力量。但是，即使在农村，我们也有条件来完成这个任务。
    有些什么有利的条件呢？农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来，农村经济发生了深刻的变化，农民群众由于经济上的需要，逐渐认识到文化问题已经成为自己的切身问题，因而学习文化的自觉性大大提高。同时，农业合作社的大量发展，使得统一地安排农民的生产和学习时间成为可能，这就使农民的学习时间有了保证。师资的力量也是雄厚的。现在农村青壮年中的非文盲大约有四千五百万人，非文盲同文盲的比例是一比四。动员农村非文盲参加扫除文盲的工作，就可以组成一支数百万以至千万人的扫除文盲大军。由于今后初中和高小毕业生以及其他识字的人必然年年增加，扫除文盲教师的来源还会不断扩大。这些都是有利的条件。
    有些干部不去分析这些有利条件，片面地强调“任务太重，困难太多”，没有完成任务的信心。这是一种保守主义的倾向。各级领导机关应该加强对这些干部的教育，帮助他们认清各方面的有利条件，认识在今后七年内加快扫除文盲的可能性，提高信心，积极领导这一工作。
    当然，困难的一面也应该看到。七年之内，扫除两亿左右的文盲，时间短，任务重，困难确实不小。农村的各项工作都很紧张，村干部、积极分子工作繁忙，学习时间有限；一部分妇女因为家庭工作的关系，很难同别人一道学习；师资的分布不平衡，在教育不发达的地区，识字的人比较少，这些也都是困难。看不到这些困难，不深入研究工作中的问题和解决问题的办法，同样是不对的。当然，决不应该害怕这些困难。对那些愿意识字而又不能参加民校学习的人，可以采取“送上门去”的包教保学等办法；村干部和积极分子的困难，可以用合理地安排生产、工作和学习的时间等办法来解决。师资分布不平衡的问题，也可以用互相调剂的办法解决。
    为了如期完成扫除文盲的任务，必须实行全面规划，加强领导。各地党政领导机关要根据各地具体的情况，按照全国在七年内基本上扫除青壮年文盲的总目标，及早制定切实可行的扫除文盲计划，贯彻执行；并且要作出发展正规的业余教育的规划，以防止“回生”现象的发生，巩固工农群众已有的知识，不断地提高他们的文化水平。各级政府的教育部门要具体负责扫除文盲工作，健全专管机构，及时指导扫除文盲工作的进行。青年团对扫除文盲负有特殊重大的责任。在确定扫除文盲计划、动员和组织文盲参加学习、发动非文盲参加扫除文盲工作等等方面，各级团委都应该密切配合教育部门，发挥积极作用。各级工会、妇联及有关部门都应当在扫除文盲运动中发挥应有的作用。
    扫除文盲运动是在党领导下的又一伟大运动，只靠领导机关的号召和少数人的活动是不够的，必须实行“以民教民”的原则，发动群众教育群众，建立一支扫除文盲大军，吸收千百万有文化的人参加这一历史性的运动。扫除文盲的教学形式很多，但必须有强大的群众教师的队伍，才有可能运用各种教学形式。如果教师很少，只能运用比较集中的教学形式；如果有了千百万教师，就可以广泛地采用例如包教保学等比较分散的教学形式，使愿意识字而确有困难的文盲能够参加学习，加速扫除文盲的进度。总之，必须采取各种办法，教育广大的城乡知识分子以及一切识字的人，把帮助别人识字，当作自己义不容辞的责任，当作自己的光荣义务。
    要使扫除文盲工作成为群众性的运动，不仅要采取一系列的组织措施，还必须开展大规模的宣传工作，利用一切可能的机会向干部和群众宣传扫除文盲的意义和步骤，抓紧时间，加快速度，动员各方面的力量支持这一工作；并且使一切不识字的人都能够自觉地参加学习，把自己变成为有文化教养的人，以便更好地参加社会主义建设事业。
