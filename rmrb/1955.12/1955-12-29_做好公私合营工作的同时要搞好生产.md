    While Doing a Good Job in Joint Public-Private Ownership, We Must Also Do a Good Job in Production
    Ji Yin
    The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in Shanghai is unfolding broadly and deeply. The vast number of workers and staff in private enterprises, as well as many capitalists, are joyfully welcoming the transformation. The production of many private enterprises has shown unprecedented new vitality in the process of joint public-private ownership. However, some capitalists, after their enterprises have been approved for joint public-private ownership, have developed a "sigh of relief" mentality. They feel that since joint public-private ownership is imminent, all problems can be solved after the transition. They have relaxed their current production efforts, even refusing to accept new processing orders. The production tasks of Shanghai's private pen manufacturing industry have been poorly completed in the last two months. After some private department stores in the Lao Zha district were approved for industry-wide joint public-private ownership, they no longer actively promoted sales, failed to purchase goods that should have been, and closed as soon as it got dark, whereas they used to stay open very late. Some private enterprises have also failed to properly arrange joint public-private ownership and production work during the preparation for joint public-private ownership, leading to some unfortunate accidents. On December 5th, a private pen factory in Shanghai, Hongguang Pen Factory, had an accident in which more than 1,200 gold pen nibs were damaged. The reason was that the worker responsible for annealing the nibs had gone to join the report-good-news team. This caused a breakdown in production, and the workshop was forced to temporarily dispatch a young worker to handle the emergency, ultimately resulting in losses.
    The workers, staff, and cadres of these enterprises should recognize that the approval of joint public-private ownership for an enterprise is not the end of the matter, but rather the beginning of more arduous work. Therefore, they must maintain a clear head and be even more diligent, not only doing a good job in the joint public-private ownership work, but also ensuring that production continues normally, in order to finally achieve joint public-private ownership smoothly. The capitalists of these enterprises should also overcome the attitude of waiting for joint public-private ownership and adopt a positive attitude, which is beneficial to both the transformation of the enterprise and their own transformation. Relevant leading organs and enterprise employees also have a responsibility to provide necessary assistance and supervision to these capitalists.
    In some private enterprises that are temporarily not yet in a position to implement joint public-private ownership, there are also some fluctuations in production. This is mainly due to the workers' impatient and anxious moods, and their eagerness to demand joint public-private ownership. Some staff members themselves also have impatient emotions, saying things like "If we don't implement joint public-private ownership soon, we won't be able to work," and "There's no energy to work." The enthusiasm of these comrades to eagerly demand the socialist transformation of enterprises is good. However, they should know that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is a very large and complex undertaking, which must be carried out step by step and in an orderly manner according to an overall plan. It cannot be that joint public-private ownership is implemented all at once, regardless of priority. The Party and trade union workers in the enterprises should tell the workers this truth and guide the enthusiasm of the masses to improve production. Because the preparatory work before joint public-private ownership is the decisive condition for implementing joint public-private ownership. If production is done well before joint public-private ownership, joint public-private ownership is more likely to happen, and it will be more likely to be successful. This is the positive and correct attitude.

    做好公私合营工作的同时要搞好生产
    季音
    上海市私营工商业的社会主义改造工作正在广阔地、深入地展开，广大私营企业的职工和许多资本家都欢欣鼓舞地迎接改造，许多私营企业的生产在公私合营过程中出现了前所未有的新气象。但是，有些资本家在企业被批准公私合营后，产生了“松一口气”的情绪，觉得反正就要公私合营了，一切问题都等公私合营以后解决，就放松了当前的生产，甚至连新的加工订货任务也不接了。上海私营制笔工业这两个月来的生产任务就完成得很不好。老闸区的一些私营百货商店被批准全行业公私合营后，不再积极推销商品，该进货的也不进，以前很晚关门的，现在天一黑就休息了。还有些私营企业在筹备公私合营中没有恰当地安排公私合营和生产工作，以致发生了一些不应有的事故。十二月五日，上海私营红光笔厂发生了一千两百多只金笔尖弄坏的事故，原因就是担任笔尖煨火工作的工人参加报喜队去了，生产发生了脱节现象，车间被迫临时派了一个青年工人去突击，终于造成损失。
    这些企业的职工和干部应当认识，企业被批准公私合营，这不是事情的结束，而是更繁重的工作的开始。因此必须保持清醒的头脑，更加兢兢业业，既要做好公私合营工作，也要使生产继续正常进行，以便最后顺利地实现公私合营。这些企业的资本家也应当克服坐等公私合营的态度，而采取积极的态度，这对于企业的改造和自己的改造都是有利的。有关领导机关和企业职工对这些资本家，也有责任进行必要的帮助和督促。
    在某些暂时还没有条件实行公私合营的私营企业里，生产上也有些波动，这主要是职工情绪急躁不安，急于要求公私合营。有些工作人员本身也有急躁情绪，说什么“再不公私合营，工作没法做了”，“工作没有劲头了”。这些同志迫切要求对企业实行社会主义改造的热情是好的，但是，要知道，私营工商业的社会主义改造是一件很庞大、复杂的工作，必须根据整体规划，有步骤有秩序地进行，不能不分先后地一下子全部实行公私合营。企业里的党和工会工作人员应当把这个道理告诉职工，把群众的热情引导到改进生产上去。因为公私合营前的准备工作是实行公私合营的决定条件。公私合营前生产搞得好，公私合营就愈有可能，也愈能合得好，这才是积极的正确的态度。
