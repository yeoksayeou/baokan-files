Henan is preparing to build a modern thermal power plant
A modern thermal power plant is about to be built in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, one of China's light industry bases. At present, the preparatory personnel of this thermal power plant and the staff of the construction unit are actively carrying out construction preparation work. This thermal power plant will start generating electricity in the autumn of 1957 after completion. At that time, the increasing number of newly built factories and urban residents in Zhengzhou can obtain a large amount of electricity, heat, steam and hot water from here, thereby saving the investment of enterprises in installing boiler equipment, and the cost of operating and managing fuel consumption. At the same time, the power consumption required in Zhengzhou, which is more than nine times greater than in 1952, will be fully sourced. (Our reporter in Zhengzhou)

    河南筹建一座近代化热电站
    一座近代化的热电站即将在我国的轻工业基地之一的河南省郑州市开工兴建。目前这个热电站的筹建人员和承建单位的职工正在积极进行施工准备工作。这个热电站建成后将于一九五七年秋天开始发电。那时，郑州市日益增多的新建工厂和城市居民，均可从这里得到大量的电力、热力、蒸汽和热水的供应。从而节省了各企业单位自安锅炉设备的投资、和经营管理燃料消耗等方面的费用。同时也使郑州市内所需的、大于一九五二年九倍多的用电量，获得充分的来源。（本报驻郑州记者）
