Since the completion of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways, on December 25, 1954, cars arrived in Lhasa simultaneously from the north and south routes. From that time until December 25, 1955, not only was it easier to transport large quantities of food from the interior, but also internal transportation within Tibet became much more convenient. As a result, the prices of all the foods needed by the monks and laypeople, such as highland barley and tsampa, have gradually decreased, alleviating some of the difficulties in people's lives. A large number of goods produced in the interior, which the people needed, have been continuously transported to Lhasa and other large cities for sale. The political, economic, and cultural aspects of Tibet were originally backward, and the conditions for construction in Tibet were also poor. However, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the Han people and the working personnel entering Tibet, the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways were built. This has made the development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture possible, the improvement of people's lives possible, and the development of local construction possible. For example, before the opening of the highways, due to inconvenient transportation, it was very difficult for the working personnel who came to help to travel back and forth. Even if the working personnel were able to overcome the difficulties on the road and reach Tibet, the items needed for construction could not be transported, and Tibet, located on the plateau, had underdeveloped production, insufficient food, and frequent price increases, which inevitably increased many difficulties in construction and work. Now, the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways have gradually overcome the above-mentioned difficulties. In this year, the political, economic, cultural, and all other construction undertakings in Tibet have begun and will continue to develop. Tibet will be built into a prosperous, happy, and fulfilling new Tibet. At the same time, due to the convenient transportation between the motherland's interior and Tibet, the connection between all fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, has become more solid and intimate. Furthermore, due to the completion of the Lhasa-Rikaze, Rijiang, and Jiangpa highways this year, major cities in Tibet have also been linked together. This was only accomplished after the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways were built, so the unity and connection within Tibet have also been strengthened, and the exchange of products between different regions has become easier. Especially in Buddhism, the Tibetan people in Xikang and Qinghai believe that Lhasa is a holy land of Buddhism. Although many people want to come to worship the statue of Sakyamuni and study Buddhism, in the past, due to the long distance and difficulties on the road, they could only make wishes and think about it from afar, and it was not easy to come to Lhasa in person. Now that the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways have been built, as long as one is sincere, one will surely be able to fulfill one's wishes. For example, this year, many Tibetan monks, laypeople, old, young, and children have come to Lhasa from far away to pay homage. These are all the immeasurable broad benefits that Tibetan Buddhism and politics have received in the year after the opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways. These are all obtained under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the selfless help of the Han people. Therefore, the Tibetan monks and laypeople must be incomparably happy to sincerely remember the kindness and express their gratitude. In the future, we must trust and support the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the help of the advanced Han people and the working personnel entering Tibet, and work together to build a new Tibet for the motherland.

    康藏、青藏公路通车一年来所得到的利益
    达赖喇嘛
    康藏、青藏两条公路修筑完成后，在一九五四年十二月二十五日，汽车由南北两条公路同时开到了拉萨市。从那时起，到一九五五年十二月二十五日的一周年中，不但从内地容易运来大量食物，并且西藏内部的交通也获得很大的方便，因此僧俗人民所需要的如青稞、?粑等一切食物的价格，都已日渐降低，减轻了人民生活上的一些困难。人民所需内地生产的大批物品，都已陆续运到拉萨等大城市中出售。西藏的政治、经济、文化等各方面，原来是落后的，西藏地方的建设条件也是差的。但在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在汉族人民以及进藏工作人员的帮助下，康藏、青藏公路修通了，这就使西藏的政治、经济、文化都获得了发展的可能和条件，人民的生活得到改善的可能，地方建设也有发展的可能。例如在通车以前，由于交通不便，来作帮助的进藏工作人员来往是非常困难的，纵使工作人员们能够克服路上的困难到达西藏，由于建设上所需要的物品不能运到，而西藏地处高原，生产不发展，食物不够用，物价常有增涨等，就不能不增加建设上和工作中的很多困难。现在康藏、青藏两条公路把上述困难逐渐克服了。在这一年中，西藏地方的政治、经济、文化等一切建设事业都已开始，并且会要继续向前发展，西藏会要建设成一个繁荣幸福美满的新西藏。同时，由于祖国内地和西藏地方间的交通方便了，这就使各兄弟民族，尤其是汉、藏民族间的联系更趋坚固和亲密。又由于拉日、日江、江帕等公路在今年修成后，使西藏各大城市也联系起来了。这是康藏、青藏公路有了以后才完成的，因此我们西藏内部的团结和联系也加强了，各地间的产品也容易交流了。尤其是在佛教方面，西康和青海等地的藏族人民都认为拉萨是佛教的圣地，虽然有很多人想来朝拜释迦牟尼的佛像，和学习佛法，但是过去由于路程太远和路途上的困难，只能在远处发愿想念，不容易亲身前来拉萨。现在康藏、青藏公路筑成后，只要自己虔诚定能如愿以偿，比如今年很多藏族僧俗老幼人民，都从很远的地方来到拉萨朝谒，这都是康藏、青藏公路通车后一年中西藏的佛教和政治方面得到不可思议的广大利益。这都是在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在汉族人民的无私帮助下而得到的，所以藏族僧俗人民都要无比欢欣地真诚念恩和感谢。今后，我们一定要信任和拥护中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，和先进汉族人民以及进藏工作人员等的帮助，为建设祖国的新西藏而共同努力。（新华社）
