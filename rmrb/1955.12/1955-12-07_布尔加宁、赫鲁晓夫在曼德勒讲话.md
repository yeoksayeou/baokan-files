Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 5th (via TASS) – As previously reported, a city-wide welcome rally was held at Mandalay Airport on December 4th to welcome Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium member Khrushchev.

    Mandalay Mayor (Chairman of the Municipal Committee) U Kyaw Yin read the welcoming address. He said: I am honored to represent the citizens of Mandalay in welcoming the outstanding leaders of the Soviet people, who have consistently shown the friendliest feelings towards the people of Burma. In recent years, our two peoples have come to understand each other. Only after our country became an independent and sovereign republic was it possible for us to meet with representatives of the Soviet Union. We gratefully recall that your great nation was one of the first to recognize our new system, and we also thank your representatives in the United Nations for supporting us in our efforts to join this global organization. Since then, the two countries have exchanged diplomatic representatives. Since then, representatives of the two countries have met frequently, and the ties of friendship between the two countries have strengthened further in the past few years.
    Few of us have been to the Soviet Union. However, those few who have had the good fortune to go there always return greatly encouraged. They often tell us about the spirit of fraternity of your people, the selflessness of your people's leaders, and their consistent desire for peace. The achievements of the Soviet Union are great, and at the same time, the Soviet Union has much to teach the world and has already taught the world.
    Next, Bulganin delivered a reply to the citizens of Mandalay. He said: We cannot but express our sympathy for the serious suffering that your beautiful city suffered in the Second World War, especially for the destruction of the palace, which was once the pride of Mandalay's history and architecture.
    As you certainly know, many of our cities were also terribly damaged and turned into ruins. The Soviet people, who have now rebuilt these cities and villages with selfless labor, are very clear about how destructive war is and how important the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace is. We attach great importance to the fact that the people of Burma stand shoulder to shoulder with our people in the cause of defending peace against the threat of a new war.
    We note with satisfaction that the people of Burma support the Soviet-Burmese Joint Statement signed in Moscow on November 3 this year, which condemns the policy of assembling blocs and recognizes that the policy of non-alignment guarantees the security of all nations and plays an active role in the cause of maintaining world peace.
    As everyone knows, the relations between our two peoples have always been sincere and friendly. Now this relationship is built on the solid foundation of the great Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which opens the way for further development of broad economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and Burma that benefits both of our countries. The joint statement I issued with Prime Minister U Nu in Moscow has affirmed these principles, and Prime Minister U Nu has called this statement a charter of friendship between our two countries.
    His speech was met with a storm of sustained applause.
    During their visit to Mandalay on December 4, Bulganin and Khrushchev, after touring the Irrawaddy River on the steamer "Mintun," accepted gifts from the citizens, including a complete set of Burmese national musical instruments from a Burmese band.
    Bulganin warmly thanked the representatives of Mandalay for the gifts.
    Afterwards, Khrushchev spoke. He said: The most precious souvenir we will take away from your country is the warm feelings you have shown towards us, the representatives of the Soviet people. (Stormy applause) We also want to express our good wishes to you – to consolidate your country, improve culture, widely disseminate knowledge among the people, and cultivate your own engineers, your own doctors, and your own teachers. (Applause) We believe that your country will progress day by day, because this is the hope of the people. (Stormy applause)
    Your country possesses abundant natural resources, and you have the desire to use these resources to serve your motherland well. You have labor power. Under correct leadership, you can ensure that the country develops victoriously. (Applause)
    The colonialists who used to rule your country artificially hindered your development. We Europeans are ashamed of those Europeans who oppressed you and plundered you. (The whole audience became active, applause) But not all Europeans think and act like colonialists, who believe that the white color of their skin gives them the right to rule black-skinned people. (Applause)
    I would like to add that our country is both a European country and an Asian country. (Applause) And the majority of our territory is on the Asian continent. (Applause) Whether they live in the European part or the Asian part of our country, the Soviet people extend their greetings to you and wish you prosperity. (Stormy applause)
    Let us have closer cooperation and mutual assistance in anything that either of us needs. At the same time, let us firmly adhere to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. (Applause) The people of every country should arrange their own lives in the way they want.
    We will fight together to consolidate world peace in order to prevent the possibility of launching a new war.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫在曼德勒讲话
    新华社据塔斯社仰光五日电　前已报道，十二月四日在曼德勒的飞机场举行了全市欢迎会，欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫。
    曼德勒市长（市政委员会主席）吴助容宣读了欢迎词。他说：我荣幸地代表曼德勒的公民欢迎经常对缅甸人民表现出最友好的感情的苏联人民的杰出领袖。在最近几年中，我们两国人民有了互相的了解。只是在我们的国家成为一个独立自主的共和国以后，我们才有可能同苏联的代表们会晤。我们怀着感激的心情回想到：你们这个大国是最先承认我们的新制度的国家之一，我们还感谢你们在联合国的代表曾经在我们争取加入这个世界性组织的时候支持过我们。在这之后，我们两国交换了外交代表。从那时起，两国的代表经常地会晤，两国友谊的联系在过去的几年中更加加强了。
    我们中间很少有人到过苏联。不过那些少数有幸去过那里的人回来的时候总是感到非常鼓舞。他们经常对我们讲你们的人民的友爱精神，你们的人民领袖们的忘我精神和他们一致渴望和平的愿望。苏联的成就是伟大的，同时，苏联有很多可以教给世界并且已经教给世界的东西。
    接着，布尔加宁向曼德勒的公民致答词。他说：我们对你们这个美好的城市在第二次世界大战中遭到的严重苦难，特别对曾经是曼德勒历史上和建筑艺术上的骄傲的皇宫遭到破坏这一点不能不表示我们的同情。
    你们当然知道，我们的许多城市也曾经遭到可怕的破坏而变为废墟。现在已经用忘我的劳动重建起这些城市和乡村的苏联人民非常清楚，战争有多么大的破坏力，维护和巩固和平的斗争是多么重要。我们很重视缅甸人民在同我们的人民并肩地保卫和平事业反对新战争威胁这一事实。
    我们满意地指出，缅甸人民拥护今年十一月三日在莫斯科签署的苏缅联合声明，这个声明谴责拼凑集团的政策，并且承认不加入集团的政策保障着各国人民的安全，在维护世界和平的事业中起着积极的作用。
    大家知道，我们两国人民的关系始终是真诚的和友好的。现在这种关系建立在和平共处的伟大五项原则的巩固基础之上，这些原则打开了进一步发展苏联同缅甸之间的有利于我们两国的广泛的经济和文化合作的道路。我同吴努总理在莫斯科发表的联合声明已经肯定了这些原则，吴努总理把这个声明称做我们两国友好的宪章。
    他的讲话获得暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。
    十二月四日在曼德勒访问的时候，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫乘“敏登号”汽船沿伊洛瓦底江游览以后接受了市民的礼物，其中有缅甸乐队的一整套缅甸民族乐器。
    布尔加宁热情地感谢曼德勒市的代表所赠送的礼物。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫讲了话。他说：我们将从你们国家带走的最宝贵的纪念品，就是你们对我们、对苏联人民的代表们所表示的热烈的感情。（暴风雨般的掌声）我们也想向你们表示我们良好的愿望——巩固你们的国家，提高文化，在人民当中广泛地传布知识，培养自己的工程师、自己的医生和自己的教师。（掌声）我们相信，你们的国家将会日益进步，因为这是人民的希望。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    你们国家拥有丰富的天然资源，你们有着利用这些资源来很好地为祖国服务的愿望。你们有着劳动力。在正确的领导下，你们可以保证国家胜利地向前发展。　（掌声）
    过去统治你们国家的殖民者曾经人为地阻挠了你们的发展。我们欧洲人为那些压迫过你们和掠夺过你们的欧洲人感到害羞。（全场活跃，掌声）但是，并不是所有欧洲人都像殖民者那样思想和行动，那些殖民者认为他们的皮肤的白颜色给了他们权利来统治黑皮肤的人。
　（掌声）
    我想补充一点，我国既是欧洲国家，同时又是亚洲国家。（掌声）而且我们领土的大部分是在亚洲大陆上。（掌声）无论是住在我国欧洲部分或是亚洲部分的苏联人都向你们致意，并且祝你们昌盛。　（暴风雨般的掌声）
    让我们在我们之间任何一方所需要的任何事情上实行更密切的合作和互助。同时，让我们坚决遵守互不干涉内政的原则。（掌声）每一个国家的人民应当按照他们所希望的方式来安排自己的生活。
    我们将为巩固世界和平而共同斗争，以便防止发动新战争的可能。
