Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The delegation of the International Islamic Youth Conference headed by Kamel Yacoub Sabry, and the Egyptian journalist delegation headed by Abdul Moneim Mahmoud Sawi, were invited to attend a welcome reception tonight. The reception was jointly held by the All-China Youth Federation, the China Association of Journalists, the Beijing Youth Federation, and the Beijing Branch of the China Association of Journalists.

Wu Han, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the four organizations at the meeting. He said that China and Egypt have a long history of cultural exchange. The Chinese people admire Egypt's achievements in science, architecture, art, astronomy, etc., and deeply appreciate the Egyptian people's contributions to world culture. During the Asian-African Conference, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser met in Bandung, and a new friendship was established between China and Egypt. The recent signing of cultural cooperation agreements and trade agreements between China and Egypt has further enhanced the friendship between the two countries. The Chinese people are familiar with the Egyptian pyramids, and the Egyptian people are familiar with China's Yangtze River. May the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people be as deep as the pyramids and as long as the Yangtze River.

Sawi, head of the Egyptian journalist delegation, and Sabry, head of the International Islamic Youth Conference delegation, delivered enthusiastic speeches at the meeting, thanking them for their welcome. Sawi said in his speech that he welcomed Chinese business representatives, professors, and students to go to Egypt, and he firmly believed that these Chinese friends who went to Egypt would help enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people. Sawi also said that Egypt has freed itself from imperialism and the monarchy, and the Egyptian people have taken the fate of Egypt into their own hands. History is beginning to move forward, and no force in the world can stop the progress of history. He finally shouted "Long live the Chinese people" and "Long live the unity of China and Egypt." Sabry said that they were very happy to have the opportunity to visit China. He said, "After arriving in China, we met some Muslim friends, all of whom have a noble spirit of creating a happy life for the people of the motherland." He hoped that Muslim youth from all countries would unite with Chinese Muslim youth and thanked them again for their warm welcome.

Among those who attended the reception tonight were Wu Han, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation; Luo Yi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League; Deng Tuo, President of the China Association of Journalists; Wu Lengxi, Vice-President; Guan Shixiong and Sun Fuling, Vice-Chairmen of the Beijing Youth Federation; Fan Jin, President of the Beijing Branch of the China Association of Journalists; Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation; Huang Hua, Director of the Department of West Asian and African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China; Gong Peng, Director of the Information Department; Dapu Sheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association; Zhang Yuzhen, Secretary-General, and more than one hundred people, including heads of news organizations and newspapers and periodicals in the capital, Chinese and foreign journalists, and youth representatives from all walks of life.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The China Islamic Association held a banquet at noon on the 24th to entertain the Egyptian journalist delegation headed by Abdul Moneim Mahmoud Sawi, editor-in-chief of the Egyptian News Agency.

Dapu Sheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet, saying: China and Egypt are both ancient civilizations in the world and have made brilliant contributions to world culture. The friendship between the people of China and Egypt is long-standing. Our two countries have had economic and cultural ties very early, and the religious ties between Muslim brothers in China and Egypt are particularly close. Dapu Sheng said: China and Egypt have had common experiences and destinies in the past, which naturally makes the people of the two countries sympathize, care for, and support each other. Now, the friendly relations between the people of China and Egypt have entered a new stage, and the exchanges between the people of the two countries are becoming increasingly close. The visit of the Egyptian journalist delegation to China will further strengthen this friendly connection between the people of the two countries. Dapu Sheng finally wished the people and Muslim brothers of China and Egypt to further join hands under the banner of peace.

Sawi delivered a reply on behalf of the Egyptian journalist delegation, saying: "We cannot express our gratitude in words for the grand reception given to us by the China Islamic Association. During our short visit to China, we have been very satisfied with what we have seen and heard. We have also seen that people in China who believe in Islam and other religions enjoy freedom of religious belief." Sawi finally said, "Mutual visits have already begun between our two countries. We hope that the people of the two countries will conduct more of these friendly visits, and we hope that there will be more mutual exchanges and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries."
