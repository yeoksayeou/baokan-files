    Punish the Bad Elements Who Squander State Property
    To the Editor:
        Gao Zhanwu, the foreman of the Wohutun road maintenance section of the Zhengjiatun Engineering Section of the Jilin Railway Bureau, often falsely reports achievements and deceives his superiors in his work. Not long ago, the Zhengjiatun Engineering Section sent them a batch of materials. Before they even started working, they reported to their superiors that they had completed the task and also wrote off a large number of unused spikes. Later, when the section conducted a material inventory, Gao Zhanwu, fearing that these spikes would be discovered and expose his deceptive behavior, ordered the worker Liang Wenyang to secretly bury the spikes. When Liang Wenyang raised objections, Gao Zhanwu said, "It doesn't matter." Later, other workers heard the sound of burying spikes, and this matter was exposed. According to statistics, Gao Zhanwu secretly buried a total of more than 700 spikes. Gao Zhanwu's behavior of deceiving his superiors and squandering state property is extremely egregious, and the Zhengjiatun Engineering Section should give him the punishment he deserves.

    惩处糟蹋国家财产的坏分子编辑同志：
    吉林铁路管理局郑家屯工务段卧虎屯养路工区工长高占武，在工作中常常假报成绩，欺骗领导。不久以前，郑家屯工务段发给他们一批材料，他们还没有开始工作就向上级报告已经完成了任务，并且把还没有用过的很多道钉也报销了。后来段里进行清点材料的工作，高占武深怕这些道钉被查出来，会暴露他的欺骗行为，就让工人梁文彦把道钉偷偷地埋掉。梁文彦提出意见，高占武还说“没有关系”。后来其他工人听见了埋道钉的声音，这件事情才被揭发出来。据统计，高占武私埋的道钉共有七百多个。高占武这种欺骗上级、糟蹋国家财产的行为是十分恶劣的，郑家屯工务段应当给他以应得的处分。
