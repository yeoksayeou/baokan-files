Title: Cannot Focus Only on Establishing Cooperatives and Neglect Production

Currently, in various parts of Guangdong, it is the busy season for winter harvesting and winter planting. However, some rural workers are single-mindedly burying themselves in establishing cooperatives in isolation, neglecting production. For example, in the Ninth District of Lufeng County in the Eastern Guangdong region, the winter harvesting campaign has already been fully launched, but the district committee is still "focusing on establishing cooperatives" and has abandoned leadership over the winter harvesting campaign. In Lin Sili Cooperative of Tan Si Township in the Second District of this county, work is underway to evaluate and incorporate means of production into the cooperative. The cooperative members have asked the township-based work team to temporarily halt this work and take three days to engage in production. However, the township-based work team replied, "We must request instructions from the district committee before a decision can be made." In many villages in Shunde County, in the Central Guangdong region, because the township-based work teams only focus on establishing cooperatives and do not ask about production, the production order in many newly established cooperatives has fallen into chaos. In Tianxin Cooperative in Jinmen Township, a sugarcane field could have been harvested by eight people, but thirty people were sent. The cooperative members were dissatisfied with this situation, saying: This is not production, it's nonsense.

The purpose of establishing cooperatives is to develop production. It is completely wrong to abandon leadership over production because of establishing cooperatives. At present, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committees and regional party committees of the Chinese Communist Party have, based on the above situation, successively issued instructions to immediately shift the focus to production and seize the time for winter harvesting and winter planting. Some instructions also specifically stipulate: Cadres dedicated to establishing cooperatives must spark a production upsurge along with the development of cooperatives. Otherwise, they are not allowed to withdraw their forces, and they are not allowed to leave.

    不能只顾办社不管生产
    广东各地目前正是冬收冬种的大忙季节，可是，有些农村工作人员，一味埋头孤立建社，不管生产。像粤东区陆丰县第九区冬收运动已经全面展开，而区委会还是以“办社为主”，对冬收运动放弃了领导。这个县二区潭四乡林泗利合作社正在进行评议生产资料入社的工作，社员们向驻乡工作人员提出暂时停止这项工作，抽三天时间搞生产。驻乡工作人员却回答说：“要请示区委会以后才能决定。”粤中区顺德县的不少乡村，因为驻乡工作人员只管办社，不问生产，许多新建社的生产秩序陷于混乱。金门乡田心社有一块蔗田，本来八个人就可以收割完毕，结果一下去了三十个人。社员们对这种情况不满，说：这不是生产，是胡闹。
    建社的目的是为了发展生产，因为建社而对生产放弃领导，这是十分错误的。目前中共广东省各区党委和地委，已经根据上述情况先后发出立刻转向生产，抓紧冬收和冬种的指示。有的指示中还特别规定：专职办社的干部，必须随着合作社的发展掀起一个生产高潮，否则，不准收兵，不准离开。
