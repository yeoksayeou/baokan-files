The Current Situation of Japanese Women
—Speech Delivered at the Invitation of the All-China Women's Federation (Summary)
Shigaki Ayako, Member of the Japanese "National Federation for Supporting the Constitution" Visiting Delegation

In the past, Chinese and Japanese women had common ground, suffering from feudal constraints and great pain. Now, the common ground between Chinese and Japanese women has a significant difference. This difference is that, although the Japanese Constitution and system stipulate equal rights for men and women, it has not been realized in actual life. The conservative party and the ruling class are trying their best to push Japanese women back to the feudal era. The Constitution also stipulates some rights. But this seems like a cake and candy drawn on paper, which cannot be eaten. Now I will talk about the real situation of Japanese women.

In the past, Japanese women could maintain their livelihoods as long as their husbands worked; but now, due to the difficulty of life, women have to go out to work. Therefore, women participate in work not for liberation or for construction. Their working years are very short, averaging two years. But they are still forced to participate in work. Japanese law stipulates equal pay for equal work, but in reality, women only receive half or a little more than half of the wages of male workers. Because women's wages are low, they cannot be economically independent. It is very difficult for female university graduates to find jobs. This situation started two or three years ago and has become more and more serious, especially this year. I have a friend studying at Waseda University. She will graduate next spring, but she has been desperately looking for a job. In the past, there was still a chance to take the exam, but this year, they are not even allowed to take the exam. This situation is all due to the existence of American imperialism in Japanese politics. Most of Japan's enterprises are under the control of American imperialism. The slightly better enterprises in Japan are mostly in the hands of American imperialism, and the remaining enterprises are in the hands of Japanese capitalists. The economy is like this, and so is the politics. The Japanese Diet is elected by the Japanese people. However, the activities of the Diet are greatly suppressed, suppressed by American imperialism. The ruling class has to implement the policies of American imperialism in order to please American imperialism.

During the war, Japanese rural women were in the mire. After the war, it can be said that there has been no change. The situation in rural Japan is this: only a small number of farmers own land, and the rest are hired laborers with no land at all. Therefore, Japanese rural women have to participate in field work. But their work is not recognized. They are still in the feudal family system.

Japanese women all demand peace. But how do they demand peace? First, let me talk about the base issue. Since the signing of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the United States has had more than 700 bases in Japan. Recently, American imperialism formally proposed to the Japanese government to expand its bases. Near my home is the Tachikawa base. It is a large base of American imperialism. The United States wants to expand the Sunagawa-cho airport here to allow jet planes to take off. The Japanese people have risen up to oppose the expansion of this airport. What will the expansion of this airport bring to the Japanese people? When the planes from this airport take off, you can't hear people talking, you can't listen to lectures in class, and chickens don't lay eggs. At the same time, with the base, there will inevitably be mischief by the American troops. American soldiers mess around with Japanese women at will. They mess around openly. Japanese women cannot find jobs, so they mess around with American soldiers. There are many widows in Japan after the war, and government subsidies cannot maintain their lives, so they have to rely on the income of American soldiers. These women are called "panpan girls." Since they are openly messing around with American soldiers, children will see it. Therefore, children's views on labor are very bad, especially in terms of sex education. There are many criminal acts by Japanese children, among which sexual crimes are the most. Mothers also become angry at the military base after seeing the impact of the military base on their children. In addition, farmers living near the base often suffer. American planes often crash, and planes fall on farmers' homes and kill people. Real bullets are often used during exercises, and farmers are often killed or injured. Therefore, the Japanese people have to oppose military bases.

In every struggle against military bases, Japanese women stand at the forefront of the struggle. This is because they demand to protect their families, lives, and children. They understand that to protect their families, lives, and children, they must defend peace. Now, the people whose land is confiscated are mainly farmers, but in the case of Sunagawa-cho, the local trade union is also participating in this struggle. In this way, farmers and workers are linked together. In the past, the government made rural and urban areas oppose each other. But this struggle has united rural and urban areas.

According to the current situation, Japanese women have played a great role in the movement to protect the peaceful constitution. We believe that defending the peaceful constitution is defending peace. If the constitution is revised, then the little rights that Japanese women have acquired will be gone, and they may return to the painful feudal family system. In the cause of defending peace, Japanese women hope to unite with Chinese women to improve Sino-Japanese relations and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries. Now, Japanese women are very concerned about the situation of Chinese women. I believe this concern will exceed your imagination. They are concerned about your liberation and construction, but they want to understand how you achieved liberation. In the past, Japan launched a war of aggression, and China and Japan were in a state of opposition. At that time, Japanese women did not understand Chinese women. But now Japanese women are very surprised after understanding Chinese women and feel that they have awakened too late. China and Japan have had more than two thousand years of relationship, and the state of opposition is very short. Japanese women hope to contact Chinese women. Only in this way can we defend peace in Asia. Japanese women are working towards this direction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    目前日本妇女的情况
    ——应中华全国民主妇女联合会的邀请发表的讲演（摘要）
    日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团员  石垣绫子
    在过去，中国妇女和日本妇女有共同点，受着封建的束缚，有很大痛苦。现在，中国妇女和日本妇女的共同点中有着很大的差别。这个差别是，在日本宪法及制度上虽然规定男女平权，但是在实际生活中却没有实现。保守的党和统治阶级尽量想把日本妇女重新推到封建时代中去。宪法上也规定了一些权利。但是这好像是一张纸上画着饼和糖果一样，是吃不到的。我现在来谈谈日本妇女的真实情况。
    日本妇女在过去，只要丈夫一人工作就可以维持生活；但是现在生活困难，妇女不得不出去工作。因此，妇女参加工作不是为了解放，为了建设。她们参加工作的年限很短，平均为二年。但是她们还是被迫不得不参加工作。日本法律上规定男女同工同酬，但实际上妇女只得到男工的一半或一半多一点点的工资，由于妇女工资低，所以她们在经济上便不能独立。大学毕业的女生是很难找到工作的。这种情况从二、三年前就已经开始，越来越厉害，特别是今年更厉害。我有一个朋友在早稻田大学念书。她在明年春天才毕业，但是早就在拚命找工作。过去还有参加考试的机会，今年连考试都不准考了。这种情况都是因为日本的政治上有美帝国主义存在的关系。日本的企业大部分都在美帝国主义的控制之下。日本稍好的企业大都在美帝国主义手中，剩下的企业在日本资本家手中。经济上是这样，政治上也是这样。日本国会是日本人民选出来的。但是国会的活动受到很大压制，受美帝国主义的压制。统治阶级为了讨好美国帝国主义不得不执行美帝国主义的政策。
    战争时，日本农村妇女处在泥坑之中。战后，可以说并没有什么改变。日本农村的情况是这样：只有很少的农户占有土地，此外都是雇农，一点土地都没有。因此，日本农村妇女不得不参加田间工作。但是她们的工作是不被承认的。她们仍旧在封建家族制度中。
    日本妇女都是要求和平的。但是她们通过什么要求和平呢？首先，我谈谈基地问题。自从美日“安全条约”签订之后，美国在日本有七百多处基地。最近美帝国主义正式向日本政府提出要扩充基地。我住家的附近有个立川基地。它是美帝国主义一个很大的基地。美国要扩充这里的砂川町机场，使它能起飞喷气机。日本人民起来反对扩充这个机场。扩充这个机场将给日本人民带来什么呢？这个机场的飞机一起飞，说话听不见，无法上课听讲，鸡不生蛋。同时，有了基地便必然有美军作祟。美国兵随便同日本妇女乱搞。他们是公开的乱搞。日本妇女是找不到工作的，所以便和美兵乱搞。日本战后寡妇很多，政府的津贴无法维持生活，不得不依靠美兵的收入。这些妇女叫“梆梆女郎”。她们既然是公开和美兵乱搞，就会被孩子们看见。因此，儿童对劳动的看法很不好，尤其对性的教育方面更不好。日本儿童的犯罪行为很多，其中性的犯罪最多。母亲们看到军事基地对孩子的影响之后也激起反对军事基地的愤怒。另外，住在基地附近的农户常常受害。美国飞机时常失事，飞机落在农户家里压死人。演习时用了真子弹也常炸死或炸伤农民。因此也使日本人民不得不反对军事基地。
    在反对军事基地的每个斗争中，日本妇女都站在斗争的前列。这是因为她们要求保护家庭、生活和孩子。她们懂得，要想保护家庭、生活和孩子必须保卫和平。现在，被没收土地的人主要是农民，但砂川町情况是当地的工会也参加这个斗争。这样，农民和工人便联系起来。以前，政府是使农村和城市互相对立。可是这个斗争却使农村和城市团结起来了。
    根据现状来看，在保护和平宪法的运动中，日本妇女起了很大作用。我们认为保卫和平宪法就是保卫和平。如果修改宪法的话，那末，日本妇女已经取得的一点点权利就没有了，可能恢复到痛苦的封建家族制中去。在保卫和平的事业中，日本妇女希望和中国妇女团结一致，改善中日关系、恢复两国邦交。现在，日本妇女对中国妇女情况很关心。我相信，这种关心会超过你们的想像。她们关心你们的解放和建设，但是她们要了解你们是怎样获得解放的。在过去有一段时间，日本发动了侵略战争，中日两国处于对立状态。那时日本妇女不了解中国妇女。可是现在日本妇女了解中国妇女后非常惊讶，感到自己觉悟的太迟了。中日有两千多年的关系，对立的状态是很短的。日本妇女希望和中国妇女联系。只有这样，才能保卫亚洲的和平。日本妇女就是朝着这个方向努力的。（新华社）
