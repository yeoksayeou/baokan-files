Going Straight to the Grassroots
Lin Li

With the rapid development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the leadership methods of Party committees at all levels must also be transformed. Otherwise, it will be difficult to adapt to the new situation that has emerged. The recent provincial committee secretary meeting held by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is the beginning of this transformation.

At this meeting, Comrade Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out when analyzing the current rural situation: The new situation in rural areas is that more and more townships have become cooperative, and by the end of next year, the entire province will achieve semi-socialist cooperation. For cooperative townships, if the leadership is good, the passive situation in the past can be completely overcome; all work can be carried out through cooperatives, and completing tasks will be easier than in the past. However, if the leadership is not good, it will be very chaotic. Because, although in the past various tasks were ultimately concentrated in the township and implemented in the township, the work of the township was not as concentrated as it is today with cooperation, and the work plans and requirements were not as strict as they are now. After cooperation, everyone needs to rely on the cooperative for their livelihood, and the cooperative needs the guidance of the state's plan, and the state must also implement its planned leadership through the cooperative. If the leadership of the township's work is not good, it will not only directly affect the lives of farmers, but also affect the realization of the state's plan. Based on the above situation, strengthening the leadership of townships has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved.

Based on the above analysis, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee proposed the leadership method of "going straight to the grassroots" and made several specific regulations. First, the provincial party committee's guidance on various tasks should directly reach the township, and the provincial party committee should meet with district and township cadres. The specific method is to hold two district committee secretary meetings every year. Provincial and stage-based work tasks are assigned to the townships through these two meetings. The district party committees, prefectural committees, and district committees are designated as the work supervision and inspection organs of the provincial party committee or county party committee, and no large work arrangement meetings will be held anymore; only small supplementary arrangement meetings will be held, as well as work inspection and regionally-held "battlefield meetings." The county party committee can, according to the work arrangements of the provincial party committee, hold meetings of the "three backbone" of the township, namely the township branch secretary, the township head, and the director of key cooperatives, to arrange and solve problems in the work. This leadership method is called the "going straight to the grassroots" method in Guangdong Province.

Secondly, the provincial party committee stipulates that each district committee should do a good job in a key cooperative in each township to learn from experience and strengthen leadership over each township. The county party committee should do a good job in a key township in each district of the county to strengthen leadership over the townships in the county. The district party committees and prefectural committees should select three townships in the key townships of each county, establish direct contact, earnestly help them do a good job, gain experience, and strengthen work guidance in the entire region. The provincial party committee will select 50 townships from the key townships contacted by the district party committees and prefectural committees to establish direct contact. In this way, the leadership organs above the county level in the province can directly establish direct working contact with about 1,000 townships. As long as the work of these 1,000 townships is effectively done, it will be of great help to the realization of the leadership method of "going straight to the grassroots."

Regarding the leadership of townships, the provincial party committee believes that it is also one of the urgent problems that needs to be solved, and plans to start in two aspects. One aspect is to establish and cultivate Party branches to make them the leading core, and to give play to the role of all township cadres through the branches. The provincial party committee believes that it is reasonable to put forward such requirements now. Because most townships in Guangdong have Party branches, and the township staff who are separated from production generally have five or six people. If the staff of credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and primary school teachers are added, there are about 20 township staff who are separated from production alone. If the Party branch organizes this force and gives full play to their role, then the work can be completely done well. On the other hand, the township Party branch must uniformly lead and plan various tasks. If there are difficult problems, do not grab everywhere; concentrate efforts, go deep into one or two cooperatives with the most prominent problems, find out the reasons, study solutions, and solve them. As long as the problem of one cooperative is solved well, it can guide all other cooperatives with the same problems to follow suit, and the problems can be quickly solved.

Now, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has adopted a new leadership method and held the first provincial district committee secretary meeting. Party committees at all levels in the province will also find their respective priorities and start working in accordance with the spirit of the new leadership method.

    一竿子插到底
    林里
    随着农业生产合作社的迅速发展，各级党委的领导方法，也必须有所转变。否则，就很难适应目前出现的新情况。中共广东省委会最近召开的全省区委书记会议，就是这种转变的开始。
    在这次会议上，省委书记陶铸同志在分析目前农村情况时指出：目前农村的新情况是合作化了的乡越来越多，到明年年底，全省将实现半社会主义合作化。对于合作化了的乡，如果领导得好，过去出现的那种工作上的被动情况就可以完全摆脱；一切工作通过合作社来进行，完成任务会比过去容易。但如果领导得不好，那就会搞得很乱。因为，过去虽然各项工作也是最后集中到乡、执行在乡，但那时乡的工作没有今天合作化了这样的集中，工作计划和要求，也就不如现在这样严格。合作化以后，每一个人都需要依靠合作社来生活，合作社又需要国家的计划领导，国家也要通过合作社才能实施它的计划领导，如果乡的工作领导得不好，不仅会直接影响农民的生活，而且会影响国家计划的实现。根据以上情况，加强乡的领导就成了当前需要解决的迫切问题。
    根据以上分析，广东省委提出了“一竿子插到底”的领导方法，并作了若干具体规定。首先是省委对各项工作的指导要直接到乡，省委要同区、乡干部见面。具体办法，是每年召开两次区委书记会议。全省性、阶段性的工作任务，通过这两次会议布置到乡。区党委、地委和区委，确定为省委或者县委的工作督促检查机关，不再召开大的布置工作的会议；只召开补充布置的小型会议，以及检查工作、分片召开的“战地会议”。县委可以根据省委的工作布置，召开乡的“三骨干”会议，即乡支部书记、乡长、重点社主任会议，布置和解决工作上的问题。这种领导方法，在广东省叫做“一竿子插到底”的方法。
    其次，省委规定，各区区委要在每个乡中搞好一个重点社的工作，用来吸取经验，加强对各乡的领导。县委要在全县每一个区搞好一个重点乡的工作，来加强对全县各乡的领导。区党委和地委，则在每一个县的重点乡中，挑选三个乡，直接建立联系，切实帮助搞好工作，取得经验，加强对全地区的工作指导。省委则在各区党委、地委联系的重点乡中，挑选五十个乡，建立直接联系。这样，全省县以上的领导机关，就可以直接跟一千个左右的乡建立直接工作联系。只要把这一千来个乡的工作切实做好了，那对于实现“一竿子插到底”的领导方法，就会有很大帮助。
    关于乡的领导，省委认为也是目前迫切需要解决的问题之一，计划从两方面着手。一方面是建立和培养党的支部，使它成为领导核心，通过支部发挥全乡干部的作用。省委认为现在提出这样的要求是合理的。因为，广东大多数乡都有了党支部，脱离生产的乡工作人员一般都有五、六人，如果加上信用合作社、供销合作社的工作人员和小学教员，光是脱离生产的乡工作人员就有二十人上下。如果党支部把这部分力量组织起来，并充分地发挥他们的作用，那就可以完全把工作做好。另方面，乡的党支部，对于各项工作必须统一领导，统一规划。遇有困难问题，不要到处乱抓；要集中力量，深入到一两个问题最突出的社里，找出原因，研究办法，加以解决。只要一个社问题解决得好，就可以引导其他一切有同样问题的社仿照处理，问题也就可以迅速解决了。
    现在，广东省委采取新的领导方法，召开了全省第一次区委书记会议。全省各级党委，也将各找各的重点，按着新的领导方法的精神开始工作。
