    Wholeheartedly Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well; Everywhere Must Plan for the Agricultural Cooperative
    Comrade Editor:
    Zuo Simin (Communist Party member) is the director of the Gao Village Agricultural Cooperative in Zhengjia Village Township, Ping Shan County, Hebei. This cooperative had only six members when it was first established in 1952. Due to increased production and continuous expansion every year, it has 119 members this spring.
    For four years, Zuo Simin has always treated the cooperative as his home and planned for it in every way. In the early days of the cooperative, it was small and had little capital. He took out lamp oil and paper from his own home for the cooperative to use and educated other members to contribute utensils to help the agricultural cooperative overcome its difficulties. After the cooperative expanded, Zuo Simin still adhered to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative. At this time, the cooperative had tofu workshops, flour mills, lime kilns, and chicken farming as sideline occupations. He traveled to the city almost every two or three days but rarely ate in the city. Once, he missed a meal while attending a meeting in Shijiazhuang and only bought five cents worth of rice and flour pancakes on the street to fill his stomach. When someone asked him why he was so frugal, he said, "The cooperative's money is hard-earned; a steady stream is the only way to live a good life!"
    In the first two years of running the small cooperative, Zuo Simin went to the fields to work with the members every day, squeezing in the cooperative's affairs in the evenings and at noon. After the cooperative expanded and there were more things to do, he still made time to go to the fields. This spring, the cooperative bought a batch of chickens that needed to be carried from Zhengding, a round trip of two hundred li. Some members were afraid of hardship and unwilling to go, so Zuo Simin led everyone to carry them together.
    Zuo Simin also cared about the lives of the members. This spring, member Li Lanmao injured his hand while chopping fodder and could not participate in labor, and his family was in great difficulty. Zuo Simin took out seven sheng of corn flour and sent it to him, and members Cui Lan and others also sent him things. Li Lanmao said with emotion, "The cooperative treats me so well that even if they chased me away, I wouldn't leave."
    While planning for the agricultural cooperative, Zuo Simin was also able to adhere to the principle of safeguarding national interests. Once, the cooperative processed rice for the grain depot and had an excess of more than five hundred jin. Individual members attempted to keep this grain. Zuo Simin led other members in criticizing this idea of taking advantage of the state and returned all the excess rice to the grain depot.
    Although Zuo Simin has done many things for the cooperative, he is always very humble. He said, "The cooperative is doing well because of the good leadership of the higher-level Party and the good production labor of all the members!" Therefore, he has won the wholehearted support of all the members.  Li Jizeng　Shi Zhang

    Not Letting the Cooperative Lose Even a Little Bit
    Comrade Editor:
    I am Zhang Chunfu, the custodian of the Jianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beishanjiao Village, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi. When I was elected, I didn't understand the importance of the custodian's work and was unwilling to do it. After being educated by Zhang Yougou (the cooperative director), the leader of the Party group, I realized that a Communist Party member should wholeheartedly run the cooperative well, that the custodian's work is very important, and that I must do it well.
    When the agricultural cooperative was first established, there was no fixed place for the furniture, and everyone threw it around after using it. In order to prevent the cooperative's farm tools from being damaged, I vacated two of my cave dwellings to store the farm tools. I also asked the accountant to help register them and stipulated that members should take them when they needed them and return them when they were finished. Later, to make it easier for everyone to use them, the commonly used farm tools were assigned to the direct custody of each labor group.
    In addition to establishing a custody system, I also often pay attention to educating members on protecting public property. Once, the second labor group did not clean the seed drill after using it and sent it back. I cleaned it up and told them: if the farm tools are not cleaned after use, they will be damaged by the soil, which will not only affect production, but also require everyone to pay to buy new ones. This year, when plowing, member Zhang Tiancai threw away several broken leather whips. I picked up these broken leather whips and calculated the cost for them: our entire cooperative has nineteen animals, which require nineteen leather whips, and one leather whip will be broken every month. If we repair the broken leather whips, we can use them for at least one or two more months. If everyone does this, the cooperative can save some money. Through this work, many members felt that what I said was reasonable and paid attention to protecting the cooperative's property. Last year alone, it saved the cooperative more than one hundred yuan.
    At the end of last year, the members rated me as a model custodian, and some even gave me the nickname "Zhang Loves the Cooperative." This is all glory given to me by the Party. In the future, I will work even harder to lead more custodians to do this work well together.
      Zhang Chunfu, Custodian of Jianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative, Xiangyuan County

    All Twenty-Seven Skinny Horses in the Cooperative Have Been Fed Fat
    Comrade Editor:
    In Daling Village, Fourth District, Nongan County, whenever Qu Tianzeng is mentioned, people will praise him and say: with such a good feeder, the livestock are fortunate!
    When the Hongqi No. 2 Cooperative in Daling Village was established in January this year, Qu Tianzeng was elected as the feeder. At that time, twenty-seven skinny horses had just been brought together in the cooperative. He was afraid that the horses would kick each other, so he watched them until almost midnight every day; he didn't feel relieved until the horses got along well. When feeding the horses, he always sifted the grass clean and mixed the feed evenly. Each time, the fodder was of a certain amount, and the horses doing heavy work were fed more. While the horses were eating, he stood by the trough and carefully observed them, and only went to rest after each horse had eaten its fill. In addition to feeding them three times a day on time, he also fed them a midnight snack.
    During the spring plowing season, he got up one night to feed the horses and found that the yellow horse had caught a cold. He couldn't find a veterinarian nearby at the time, so he treated the horse himself. He spent a lot of effort blowing a bamboo tube of medicine into the horse, and then led the horse around until dawn, finally curing the yellow horse's illness.
    When harrowing the second time, the feed ran out. It was hot, and the horses ate a lot of grass and were easily thirsty. At that time, he had boils on his legs, but every day he carried seven buckets of water from the well half a li away from the cooperative to water the horses.
    Because of his meticulous feeding, all twenty-seven skinny horses quickly became fat. He happily said, "I'm happier than anything when the horses eat fat."
    Old Qu is not only a good feeder but also a thrifty member. Every day after the horses went out to work, he carried a dung basket and picked up manure in the villages and on the roads. From the beginning of spring until now, the manure he has picked up is enough to fertilize two qing of land. He is also responsible for repairing any broken farm tools in the cooperative. During the autumn harvest this year, the cooperative bought five pigs, and he took on the job of feeding the pigs, feeding them until they were fat.
    Qu Tianzeng's wholehearted work for the cooperative has been praised by the cooperative's leaders and members. In the autumn harvest distribution, the members unanimously decided to give him the highest labor points in the cooperative, and also gave him one hundred and fifty points as a reward.
            Zhang Lishu, Organization Department of the CPC Nongan County Committee, Jilin Province

    Keeping the Cooperative's Accounts Clear
    Comrade Editor:
    Liu Bingwen is the accountant of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Luoji Township, Eighth District, Zhongxiang County, Hubei. He only went to school for four years and couldn't even calculate multiplication and division. Therefore, when he first took on the accounting job in 1953, he often made mistakes in the accounts, earned fewer work points, and was often blamed by the members and his family. At that time, he was very depressed and felt that doing accounting work was thankless. The Party and Youth League organizations educated him, making him realize that accounting work is the "internal manager" of the agricultural cooperative, and that Youth League members cannot bow their heads to difficulties and must work hard to do this job well.
    Therefore, he began to actively study his profession. He participated in production during the day and settled accounts and studied at night, often until midnight. In 1954, comrades came from the township to do autumn grain requisition work, and he humbly went to learn abacus calculation. Whether it was day or night, rainy or sunny, he ran several li to the township whenever he had time. Even on the way back and forth, he did not relax his studies, singing the abacus formulas as songs. Soon, he became familiar with the abacus, calculating quickly and accurately.
    Originally, the cooperative used the old-fashioned running account method, which was easy to record but difficult to settle. With the help of the staff stationed in the cooperative, he learned and used the new-style accounting method. He also created some forms, which were of great benefit to the cooperative's work. For example, the work point record is based on the labor force, and is published regularly among the members, which not only avoids errors in work point recording but also encourages and urges members to work more enthusiastically.
    With his efforts, the cooperative's accounts were kept clear, and the members praised him. His work points have already been earned no less than the average labor force, and his family is also very satisfied. He has been elected as the head of the accounting network of seventeen agricultural cooperatives in the local area, and also gloriously attended the National Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth.　　Jing Qing

### 一心一意把农业生产合作社办好  处处都要替农业社打算

    一心一意把农业生产合作社办好
    处处都要替农业社打算编辑同志：
    左思敏（共产党员）是河北平山县郑家庄乡高村农业社的社长。这个社在一九五二年刚办起来的时候只有六户社员，以后由于年年增产，年年扩大，到今春已经有一百十九户社员了。
    四年来，左思敏一向是以社为家，处处都要替农业社打算。建社初期，社小，生产资金少，他就从自己家里拿出灯油、纸张来给社里用，又教育其他社员也给社里凑了不少用具，使农业社度过了困难。社扩大后，左思敏还是坚持了勤俭办社的方针。这时社里有了豆腐坊、粉坊、灰窑和养鸡等副业，他差不多两三天就往城里跑一趟，但是很少在城里买饭吃；有一次到石家庄开会误了饭，只在街上买了五分钱的米面煎饼充饥。有人问他为什么这样节省，他说：“社里的钱来的不容易，细水长流才能过好日子！”
    在头两年办小社的时候，左思敏每天都同社员一起下地生产，社里的事情都挤在晚上和中午办。社扩大以后，事情多了，但是他仍然抽空下地。今春，社里买了一批鸡，要到正定去担，来回二百里路，有些社员怕苦不愿去，左思敏就带领大家一块去担。
    左思敏对社员生活也很关心。今春社员李蓝毛铡伤了手，不能参加劳动，家里生活很困难。左思敏就拿出七升玉米面送给他，社员崔兰等也给他送东西。李蓝毛感动地说：“社里待我这样好，以后就是撵我，我也不出社。”
    左思敏一方面为农业社打算，另一方面又能坚持维护国家利益的原则。有一次社里给粮库加工碾米，涨秤五百多斤。个别社员企图留下这批粮食，左思敏带动其他社员批判了这种占国家便宜的思想，把涨秤的米全部还给了粮库。
    左思敏虽然为社办了许多事，但是他总是十分虚心。他说：“社办的好，是因为上级党领导的好，全体社员生产劳动的好！”因此，他得到全体社员的衷心拥护。  李吉增　史章
    不让社里有一点东西受损失编辑同志：
    我是山西襄垣县北山角村建华农业生产合作社的保管员。我当选的时候，不了解保管工作的重要性，因而不愿意干。经过党小组长张有苟（社长）的教育，我认识了共产党员应该全心全意把社办好，保管员的工作很重要，一定要把它搞好。
    农业社初建立起来的时候，家具没有个固定的放处，大家用了以后就乱扔。为了不让社里的农具遭到损失，我就把家里两孔土窑腾出来放农具，又请会计帮着登记了，规定社员要用来拿，用完了要送回来。后来，为了让大家使用方便，又把常用的农具分归各个劳动小组直接保管。
    除了建立保管制度以外，我还经常注意向社员进行爱护公共财产的教育。有一次，第二劳动小组用罢种谷耧没有擦干净，就送回来了，我一面把它擦净了，一面就告诉他们：农具用完了不擦干净，沾上土沤坏了，不但会影响生产，并且还得大家摊钱重买。今年耕地的时候，社员张天才把折断的几根皮鞭随手就扔掉了，我就拣起这几根断皮鞭，跟他们算了一笔账：我们全社十九条牲口，要用十九条皮鞭，那一个月也要坏皮鞭。如果把断的皮鞭接起来，至少能多用一两个月。大家这样做，社里就可以节省一笔支出。经过这许多工作，很多社员都感到我说的有理，就注意爱护社里的东西了。去年一年，就给社里节约了一百多元。
    去年年底，社员们把我评成了模范保管员，有人还给我取了个外号叫“张爱社”。这都是党给我的光荣。今后我还要加倍努力，带动更多的保管员共同做好这个工作。
      襄垣县建华农业生产合作社保管员　张春福
    全社二十七匹瘦马都养胖了编辑同志：
    在农安县四区大岭村里，一提起曲天增来，人们都会赞扬地说：有这样好的饲养员，牲口就享福了！
    今年一月大岭村红旗二社成立的时候，曲天增就被选为饲养员。当时二十七匹瘦马刚集中到社里来，他怕马踢架，每天都看到小半夜；直到马合群了才放了心。在喂马的时候，他总是把草筛得干干净净的，把料拌得均均匀匀的，每次草料都有一定的数量，干重活的马就多喂些。马在吃草，他就站在槽边细心观察，直到每匹马都吃饱了才去休息。每天除了按时喂三遍以外，半夜里还要喂一遍夜草。
    在春耕期间，有一次他半夜起来喂马，发现黄?马着凉了。当时附近找不到兽医，他就自己给马医治。费了很大劲给马吹了一竹管药，然后就牵着马一直蹓到天大亮，终于把黄?马的病治好了。
    ?二遍地的时候，料没有了。天热，马吃的草多就容易渴。那时候，他腿上正长着疖子，但是每天半夜都从离社小半里地远的井里挑七担水回来饮马。
    由于他这样精心饲养，二十七匹瘦马很快都长胖了。他高兴地说：“马吃得胖胖的，我比啥都高兴。”
    老曲不仅是个好饲养员，也是个勤俭的社员。每天马出去干活以后，他就背起粪筐，到屯头、大道上拣粪。从开春起到现在，他拣的粪就能下两垧地。社内有的农具坏了，他还负责修理。今年秋收的时候，社里买了五口猪，他又担当了喂猪的工作，把猪喂得肥肥的。
    曲天增这样一心一意为社工作，受到社里负责人和社员们的表扬。在秋收分配中，社员一致决定给他以社内最高的劳动分，另外还给他一百五十分作为奖励。
            中共吉林省农安县委组织部　张立枢
    把社里的账目搞得一清二楚编辑同志：
    刘炳文是湖北钟祥县八区罗集乡曙光农业社的会计员。他过去只念过四年书，连乘除法都不会算。因此，一九五三年他刚担任会计工作的时候，就常常记错账，工分也挣得少，经常受到社员的责难和家里的埋怨。当时他很苦闷，认为搞会计工作吃力不讨好。党、团组织就教育他，使他认识了会计工作是农业社的“内当家”，青年团员不能向困难低头，一定要努力把这个工作做好。
    于是，他就开始积极钻研业务。他白天参加生产，晚上结账和学习，经常搞到半夜。一九五四年乡里来了搞秋征工作的同志，他就虚心地去学习珠算，不管白天黑夜，下雨天晴，一有空就跑几里路到乡里去。就是在往返途中，他也不放松学习，把珠算口诀当歌唱。不久，他就熟悉了珠算，算得又快又准。
    原来，社里用的老式流水账，记账容易结账难；他在驻社工作人员的帮助下，学会了并且使用了新式记账法。他又创造了一些表格，对社里工作有很大好处。像记工表是按劳动力立账的，定期在社员中公布，不但可以避免记工中的差错，而且还鼓舞和督促了社员更加热情地劳动。
    在他的努力下，社里的账目搞得一清二楚的，社员们都夸奖他。他的工分已经挣得不比一般的劳动力少，家里也很满意。他已经被选为当地十七个农业社的会计网的负责人，还光荣地出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。　　荆青
