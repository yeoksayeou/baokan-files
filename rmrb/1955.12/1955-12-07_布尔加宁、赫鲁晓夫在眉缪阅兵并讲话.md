Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 5th: Bulganin and Khrushchev, accompanied by the Minister of Defense of the Union of Burma, U Ba Swe, arrived in Maymyo, the headquarters of the Northern Military Region of Burma, from Mandalay on the afternoon of December 4th.

    U Ba Swe held a banquet on the same day to entertain the Soviet guests.

    On the morning of the 5th, the hosts invited Bulganin and Khrushchev to watch a military parade of Burmese land, sea, and air forces, as well as columns of armored vehicles and artillery. Accompanied by U Ba Swe and Ne Win, Bulganin and Khrushchev reviewed the troops in a military vehicle. Then, Bulganin and Khrushchev delivered brief speeches to the Burmese officers and soldiers.

    Bulganin first thanked the hosts for giving them the opportunity to watch the parade. He expressed his hope for further strengthening and developing the friendship between the Soviet Union and Burma and for striving to consolidate world peace. Finally, he paid tribute to the Burmese army, which had made great contributions to driving foreign aggressors out of Burmese territory, and wished them success in their work.

    Khrushchev then delivered a speech, saying that he had had many meetings with the leaders of the Burmese government and the Burmese people in recent days. These meetings showed that the Soviet Union and Burma shared common views on some of the most important issues.

    He said, my friendly hope for the generals, officers, and soldiers of the Union of Burma is that you can continue to improve technically. We, like you, must have armed forces. We are training them with a spirit of patriotism, with a spirit of readiness to sacrifice themselves when necessary to defend the country from foreign aggressors. I hope that your armed forces will also be like this, so that you can be ready to gloriously defend the independence you have won with blood. To achieve this, you must study military art, train your own military commanders, and strengthen the ties between the army and the people, so that you can have a people's army that faithfully serves the people.

    Khrushchev said: Maintaining armed forces is a very costly affair for any country. But we have to bear this cost because, until now, other countries have not agreed to disarm. However, we have not lost hope that we can solve this problem. We will spare no effort to seek mutual understanding among all countries, to end the Cold War, and thus to reach agreement on the issue of reducing armaments or complete disarmament, on banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, and on establishing effective international supervision.

    Finally, he shouted: Long live the friendship between the Burmese people and the Soviet people! Long live world peace!

    The troops shouted in unison, "Long live Bulganin! Long live Khrushchev!"

    Then, a march-past took place. After the march-past, Bulganin and Khrushchev traveled by car to the Anisakan Airport, from where they flew to Rangoon. They arrived in Rangoon at 1:00 PM local time on the 5th.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫在眉缪阅兵并讲话
    新华社据塔斯社仰光五日讯：布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在缅甸联邦国防部长吴巴瑞的陪同下，在十二月四日下午从曼德勒到达缅甸北方军区司令部所在地眉缪。
    吴巴瑞为招待苏联贵宾，在当日举行了宴会。
    五日上午，主人们邀请布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫观看了有缅甸陆海空军部队以及装甲车和炮兵部队纵队参加的阅兵式。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在吴巴瑞和奈温的陪同下，乘军用汽车检阅了部队。然后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫向缅甸军官和士兵们发表了简短的讲话。
    布尔加宁首先对主人们使他们有机会观看这次阅兵式表示感谢。他希望今后更进一步地加强和发展苏、缅两国的友谊，为巩固世界和平而斗争。最后，他向在把外国侵略者赶出缅甸国土的工作中作过巨大贡献的缅甸军队致敬，并且祝他们在自己的工作中取得成就。
    赫鲁晓夫接着发表讲话，他说，几天来他曾经同缅甸政府的领袖们和缅甸人民有过许多次会见。这些会见说明苏缅两国在一些最重要的问题上是意见一致的。
    他说，我对缅甸联邦的将军们、军官们和士兵们的友好的希望是，你们可以继续进行你们在技术方面的改进的工作。我们也同你们一样必须有武装部队。我们正在以热爱祖国的精神、以准备为了保卫国家不受外国侵略者侵犯而在必要时作自我牺牲的精神训练他们。我希望你们的武装部队也能够这样，以便你们能够准备好光荣地保卫用鲜血换来的独立。为了达到这个目的，你们必须学习军事艺术，训练你们自己的军事指挥官，加强军队同人民的联系，这样才能有一支忠诚地为人民服务的人民军队。
    赫鲁晓夫说：维持武装部队，对于任何国家来说都是一件很花钱的事情。可是我们不得不担负这种费用，因为到现在为止，其他国家还没有表示同意裁军。不过，我们并没有丧失我们能够解决这个问题的希望。我们将不遗余力地设法达成所有国家的相互谅解，结束冷战，从而在裁减军备或全面裁军的问题上，在禁止原子武器和氢武器和建立有效的国际监督的问题上，取得协议。
    最后，他高呼：缅甸人民和苏联人民之间的友谊万岁！世界和平万岁！
    部队齐声高呼“布尔加宁万岁！赫鲁晓夫万岁！”
    接着，举行了分列式。分列式结束后，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫乘车到阿尼沙甘飞机场，从那里坐飞机到仰光去。他们在五日当地时间下午一时到达仰光。
