Prime Minister Grotewohl's Speech

Respected Prime Minister Comrade! Dear comrades and friends!

I am very glad to represent the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic in expressing our gratitude for the warm welcome you have given us here.

The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are brothers in the big family headed by the Soviet Union. The common goal that the members of this family—that is, the people of the countries in the peace camp—are striving for is to guarantee and maintain peace and to build a happy life for the working people.

This noble goal and the achievements already made are shattering the conspiracies of imperialism. Therefore, the imperialists are trying every possible means to undermine our common construction cause. The history of recent years has many examples illustrating that these attempts are doomed to failure. The great Chinese people have driven the imperialists out of their own country and are actively fighting to maintain and consolidate peace on the easternmost front of the peace camp. The task of us, the people of the German Democratic Republic, is to contribute our share to the defense of peace on the westernmost front in the struggle against imperialism. It is our responsibility to stop West German imperialism and militarism, which are colluding with American monopolists, from launching a new world war.

We fully recognize our responsibility for defending peace in Europe. Dear Chinese friends, you can be sure that we will spare no effort to gloriously complete our task. The fact that we have such strong friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, who are strongly united with us in fraternal friendship, strengthens our confidence even more.

At the same time, what unites our two countries is that the policies of both our countries are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social and political systems, which were initiated by you, Comrade Prime Minister, and Prime Minister Nehru of the Republic of India, and affirmed at the Bandung Conference.

Another fact that unites us is that we both fully support the people of all countries who are fighting to liberate themselves from the shackles of colonial oppression.

We believe that our visit to your great country will help further consolidate the friendly relations between the people of China and Germany, and thus also help further consolidate the peace camp.

I ask you to join me in a toast to the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Germany, to further good achievements in our common struggle for peace and the security of all peoples, and to the great Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong!

### 格罗提渥总理的讲话

专栏：

    格罗提渥总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志！亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    我很高兴能代表德意志民主共和国政府代表团对你们在这里给予我们的热烈欢迎表示感谢。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国是在以苏联为首的大家庭里的兄弟。这个大家庭的成员——也就是说和平阵营各国人民——所努力争取的共同目标是：保障和维护和平，并且为劳动人民建设幸福的生活。
    这个崇高的目标和业已取得的成就，正粉碎着帝国主义的阴谋。因此，帝国主义者想尽一切办法，企图破坏我们共同的建设事业。最近几年的历史有许多例子说明这些企图是注定要失败的。伟大的中国人民已经把帝国主义者从自己的国家里驱逐出去，并且正在和平阵营东方的最前线为维护和巩固和平而积极斗争。我们德意志民主共和国人民的任务，就是在反对帝国主义斗争的西方最前线为保卫和平贡献出一分力量。制止同美国垄断资本家勾结起来的西德帝国主义和军国主义发动新的世界大战，是我们的责任。
    我们充分认识到我们在欧洲保卫和平的责任，亲爱的中国朋友们，你们可以确信：我们为了光荣地完成我们的任务，将不吝惜自己的力量。我们有着以兄弟般的友谊同我们坚强团结起来的苏联和中华人民共和国这样强大的朋友，这一事实更加强了我们的信心。
    同时，把我们两国团结在一起的是因为我们两国的政策都是建立在不同社会和政治制度的各国和平共处的五项原则之上，而五项原则就是您，总理同志和印度共和国总理尼赫鲁先生所倡议的，并且在万隆会议上得到肯定的。
    把我们团结在一起的另一个事实是，我们都全力支持为争取从殖民主义压迫的枷锁下获得解放而斗争的各国人民。
    我们相信，我们在你们伟大的国家的访问，将有助于进一步巩固德中两国人民之间的友好关系，从而也有助于进一步巩固和平阵营。
    我请诸位同我一起，为德中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊，为我们争取和平和各国人民安全的共同斗争获得进一步的良好成就，为以毛泽东同志为首的伟大中国人民干杯！
