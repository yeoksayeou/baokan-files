Don't Let "Planning" Restrain Yourself
Li Yan

Recently, some strange phenomena have occurred in individual areas of Fengrun County, Hebei Province. At a Party meeting in Lizhaozhuang Township, Xinjun District, the Party branch secretary criticized a Communist Party member who had established a new cooperative with 63 households, saying: "Why don't you act according to the plan? Why don't you implement the decisions of the general branch committee?" Why the criticism? Because according to the general branch committee's "plan," the number of peasant households joining the cooperative in Lizhaozhuang Village this winter and next spring should only account for 40 percent of the total 145 households. However, the cooperative established by this Communist Party member absorbed more than 43 percent of the village's total households. At the same time, three more cooperative frameworks were set up in the village, and another 56 households were preparing to join. What to do when the mass movement doesn't follow the "plan"? The Party branch secretary finally decided: this Communist Party member must find a way to mobilize 30 peasant households to withdraw from the cooperative, letting them either transfer to a team or work individually, waiting for a new plan.

In Cuijiatun Village, Xiaoji District, there were already ten old cooperatives last year. Individual farmers personally witnessed the superiority of the cooperatives and further realized the correctness of the Party's collectivization policy. Therefore, after the collectivization movement began, 120 peasant households successively applied to join the cooperatives. As a result, after only 54 peasant households joined, the cooperative stopped absorbing members, refusing to admit the 66 peasant households outside the cooperative's door. Because the village's Party organization originally planned to only absorb 54 peasant households into the cooperative. The deputy secretary of the township general branch replied very bluntly to the peasants who requested to join: "The plan is complete, no more admissions."

The leadership is correcting this kind of mistake, but this attitude towards planning deserves attention.

With comprehensive planning, we can be well-informed, strive for initiative, avoid being passive, strengthen planning, and reduce blindness. However, this kind of planning must be carefully studied by Party members, cadres, and activists, and must be repeatedly discussed with the masses, not lightly or carelessly. However, when Lizhaozhuang Township and Cuijiatun Village formulated their plans, they neither consulted with cadres and activists, nor discussed with the masses. They simply allocated numbers to each village based on the district's planning indicators, or determined percentages based on their subjective assumptions. Therefore, the distance between their formulated plans and actual needs is so large. Planning should be as suitable as possible for actual needs, but it is very difficult to achieve complete suitability. Therefore, when implementing the plan, it is necessary to be flexible, not to let the plan restrain oneself and the mass movement. The plan should be revised at any time according to the development and changes of the mass movement. Only in this way can the guiding and promoting role of planning be fully utilized for the mass movement, and it will not become a "code of conduct and commandments" that hinders the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, as in Lizhaozhuang Township and Cuijiatun Village.

    不要被“规划”束缚了自己
    黎言
    最近，河北省丰润县的个别地区，发生了一些怪现象。在新军屯区李钊庄乡的一次党的会议上，总支书记批评一个办了六十三户的新社的共产党员说：“为什么不按规划办事？为什么不执行总支委员会的决议？”为什么批评呢？因为按照总支委员会的“规划”，李钊庄村今冬明春的入社农户，只能占总农户一百四十五户的百分之四十。而这个共产党员办的社就吸收了全村总农户的百分之四十三还多。同时，村里又另外搭起了三个社架子，还有五十六户准备参加。群众运动没有按照“规划”办事怎么办呢？总支书记最后决定：要这个共产党员设法动员三十户农民出社，让他们或者转组，或者单干，等待新的规划。
    在小集区的崔家屯村，去年就有十个老社。单干农民亲眼看到了合作社的优越性，进一步体会了党的合作化方针的正确性。因此，在合作化运动开始以后，先后就有一百二十户农民申请入社。结果，只有五十四户农民入社之后，合作社就停止吸收了。把六十六户农民拒绝在合作社的大门之外。因为这个村的党组织原来作的规划就只吸收五十四户农民入社。乡总支副书记对要求入社的农民答复得很干脆：“规划完成，不再吸收。”
    领导上正在纠正这种错误，但是，这种对待规划的态度，却值得引起注意。
    有了全面规划，我们就能做到心中有数，就可以争取主动，避免被动，加强计划性，减少盲目性。但是，进行这种规划必须由党员、干部、积极分子认真地研究，必须同群众反复地商量，一点也轻率和粗糙不得。而李钊庄乡和崔家屯村制定规划的时候，既没有同干部、积极分子研究，更没有同群众商量，只是根据区里的规划指标给各村分配数字，或者根据自己的主观推断确定百分比。因此，他们制定的规划同实际需要中间的距离差得这样大。规划应该尽可能适合实际需要，但是，做到完全适合实际需要是很不容易的，因此，在执行规划的时候，就必须灵活，不要让规划束缚了自己，束缚了群众运动。应该根据群众运动的发展和变化，随时修正规划，只有这样，才能充分发挥规划对群众运动的推动和指导作用，而不至于像李钊庄乡和崔家屯村那样，把规划变成妨碍群众社会主义积极性的“清规和戒律”。
