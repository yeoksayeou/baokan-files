    Imperialism's Tool
    —One of the Crimes of the Gong Pinmei Counter-Revolutionary Clique
    By Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    In the great struggle of the people of Shanghai to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, another counter-revolutionary clique hidden within the Catholic Church – the Gong Pinmei Counter-Revolutionary Clique – was exposed in early September.
    Many facts revealed in this struggle prove that the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique was an important tool for imperialism to carry out subversive activities in our country. The core members of this counter-revolutionary clique were all loyal lackeys long fostered and trained by imperialism. The head of the clique, Gong Pinmei, was originally the largest landlord in Tangmu Township, Chuansha County, Jiangsu Province. From his grandfather, Gong Wenguan, to his father (a follower of the imperialist element "Father Shun"), they all relied on imperialist forces to collect high rents, lend at usurious rates, and cruelly exploit and extort farmers to get rich. Gong Pinmei even more directly embarked on the counter-revolutionary path of being an enemy of the Chinese people. For a long time, he followed the instructions of imperialist elements, constantly providing imperialism with various intelligence reports and accepting funds for imperialist espionage activities. He hid radio transmitters and receivers, guns and bullets, and other military supplies for espionage work to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. He concealed a large number of Kuomintang secret agents, major traitors, and despotic landlords and other counter-revolutionary elements, and directed his counter-revolutionary clique to carry out frantic activities to subvert the government of the People's Republic of China. Zhang Xibin, one of the core members of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique and Gong Pinmei's advisor, had always colluded with Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and US-Chiang secret agents in the past to betray the motherland and harm the people. When Zhang served as the principal of Zhendan Middle School in Yangzhou in 1948, he often had telephone contact with the Chiang bandit police bureau to persecute progressive students. When he was at the original middle school in Suzhou and Zhendan Middle School in Yangzhou, he forced students to join the Three People's Principles Youth League and organized reactionary organizations such as "Student Military Police" and "Special Training Class" to conduct fascist training on students. After liberation, he continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities until his arrest. Others, such as Jin Luxian and Fu Hezhou, core members of the Gong Pinmei clique, were also from landlord and capitalist backgrounds. Among the henchmen of the Gong Pinmei clique, there were many Kuomintang secret agents, reactionary officers, Kuomintang reactionary government officials, traitors, and local bullies. The Gong Pinmei clique was composed of these social dregs and reactionary elements. Gong Pinmei and other counter-revolutionary elements and their masters – imperialist elements hidden in the Catholic Church in Shanghai – have been opposing the revolutionary people for many years. During the period when the Japanese devils occupied Shanghai, imperialist elements and reactionary elements in the Shanghai church openly feasted the Japanese devils and traitors, and used the Yangjingbang Church to hold a "Mass for the Fallen Soldiers of Japan and China," which was attended not only by traitors but also by Japanese secret agents. In 1946, when the Kuomintang launched a civil war, prices soared, and people were living in misery, the people of the whole country hated the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, but at that time, Bishop Haouisee August of the Catholic Shanghai Diocese praised Chiang Kai-shek as a "'genius' bestowed on China by God" in a letter to the church members!
    These people had long been preparing to undermine the people's revolutionary cause. As early as July 10, 1946, they held a meeting to arrange counter-revolutionary activities, attended by nine people including Ding Ruren, a core member of the Gong Pinmei clique. The record of this meeting was titled:
    "How to Deal with the Communist Party." The meeting assigned tasks to the reactionary pawns "in the red areas" (i.e., the liberated areas) and the so-called "in the free areas" (i.e., the Kuomintang-controlled areas), requiring the reactionary elements "in the red areas" to "stay behind as much as possible" (i.e., lie dormant) and to conceal their identities; it warned the pawns in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to make various counter-revolutionary preparations as early as possible, "to earnestly organize and consolidate the training of young church members at all levels so that they will not be poisoned by the Communist Party." Soon, the imperialist element Haouisee August believed that "the time for action has come," and in order to carry out counter-revolutionary activities more effectively, he explicitly stated that in the future, "there must be a corps composed of brave soldiers." This "corps" was the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique that followed. (The meeting record of "How to Deal with the Communist Party" and Haouisee August's instructions, two counter-revolutionary documents mentioned above, have all been seized by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.)
    It was under these circumstances that Gong Pinmei was announced as the "Catholic Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese" by imperialist elements in August 1950. From then on, Gong Pinmei and the core members of his clique, under the guise of religion, further engaged in the despicable act of betraying the motherland.
    The counter-revolutionary activities of the Gong Pinmei clique were carried out under the command of imperialism. The imperialist spy Fernand La Cretalle, who had been expelled from our country, was one of the direct commanders of the Gong Pinmei clique. This imperialist element, who had engaged in espionage activities in our country for many years, had the public profession of Gong Pinmei's "theological advisor" and "President of the Society of Jesus" in Shanghai, but was actually the behind-the-scenes decision-maker of all the counter-revolutionary activities of the Gong Pinmei clique. After being arrested, La Cretalle confessed that he often "helped Gong Pinmei oppose the various movements led by the People's Government in a foreign imperialist way." "When I saw that a new movement was about to be launched, I would first study the issue myself, write a reply in Latin, and send it to the Jesuit priests and Bishop Gong, and then Bishop Gong would send it to the priests in the diocese." La Cretalle also confessed that in August 1952, when the People's Government noticed their criminal behavior, Gong Pinmei colluded with him to destroy the evidence of espionage activities, "destroying all the archives of the Shanghai Diocese kept in the 'Archives Room' of Xujiahui. The purpose of the destruction was to prevent the government from obtaining old documents regarding the relationship between the Jiangnan Diocese and foreign consulates, as well as the correspondence of the missionaries. In these letters, one could find the language of imperialism."
    For a long time, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, using the religious institutions of the Catholic "Shanghai Diocese," colluded with many imperialist spies and secret agents to carry out espionage activities to collect state secrets.
    The imperialist spy George Marie Antoine Germain, who was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government in July 1952, was directly colluding with Gong Pinmei. The veteran international spy Germain had been engaged in espionage work in our country since 1932, probing into the military intelligence of our Red Army and the People's Liberation Army. After liberation, this international spy was appointed by Gong Pinmei as "Bishop's Advisor" and "Director of the Bishop's Finance Committee," hiding in the Bishop's residence and continuing his old tricks. In 1952, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government arrested and deported this international spy. Later, Germain became the liaison point between the Gong Pinmei clique and imperialism in Hong Kong. Gong Pinmei continued to send intelligence abroad through him. After arriving in Hong Kong, Germain kept writing letters. In a letter dated January 9, 1954, he said: "Thank you for your interesting letter. ... I urgently need the investigative figures you asked for." In May, he wrote again: "The materials sent by Gong Pinmei have been received." In order to repay Gong Pinmei and others, Germain constantly sent large amounts of activity funds. From January 1954 to July 1955 alone, the incomplete figure verified by the People's Government was that Germain had sent Gong Pinmei US$6,503 in activity funds.
    Alain De Terwagne, another imperialist spy captured in Shanghai on March 25, 1953, was also engaged in espionage activities under the cover and assistance of the Gong Pinmei clique. From September 1951, Terwagne engaged in espionage activities under the guise of missionary work, probing into our country's political, military, and economic secrets, compiling 30 intelligence reports, and sending them to foreign imperialist intelligence agencies using various codes. Terwagne confessed: "The Bishop's residence was one of my main sources of intelligence." "Fu Hezhou and Li Du (note: both are core members of the Gong Pinmei clique) both provided me with intelligence about Shanghai, Haimen, and other places." Terwagne also personally trained Shen Baoyi, Gong Pinmei's private secretary, in the use of codes and gave him the tools to use codes, with the aim of "ensuring that intelligence would not be interrupted in case he was expelled from Shanghai." (Terwagne's confession)
    The Gong Pinmei clique also colluded with and sheltered many other imperialist spies. For example, the American spy Thomas Leonard Phillips (American citizen, priest of the Emperor Hall) confessed: "After the liberation of Shanghai, I supplied the intelligence I obtained from the church members of the hall to Charles Joseph McCarthy, an American citizen and vice president of the Jesuit Seminary." The "hall" mentioned here refers to the various Catholic churches in Shanghai controlled by the Gong Pinmei clique. Through this relationship, Phillips and McCarthy had successively collected a great deal of military intelligence, such as the location of the PLA wounded soldier hospitals, the PLA anti-aircraft artillery positions defending Shanghai, the training of the Chinese People's Air Force, and the location of airports. They also collected intelligence on Shanghai prices, the Huaihe River water conservancy project, the flood and wind disaster situation in our country, and the situation of various patriotic movements in the country.
    The Gong Pinmei clique was a tightly organized counter-revolutionary clique. Over the years, they used the religious signboard as a cover to develop various counter-revolutionary organizations.
    In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, imperialist elements in the Catholic Church in Shanghai used the "Legion of Mary" as the main organization for counter-revolutionary activities to disrupt the various measures of the People's Government. On October 8, 1951, the Shanghai Military Control Commission ordered the ban of the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," ordering the personnel of the "Legion of Mary" to register with the government and withdraw from the group. At this time, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique on the one hand tried its best to prevent the members of the "Legion of Mary" from registering with the government, and at the same time decided to transfer a large number of "Legion of Mary" members to another "Catholic Youth" organization (referred to as "Catholic Youth"), using this organization to cover up their continued counter-revolutionary activities. According to the materials that have been verified, a total of 155 "Legion of Mary" members were transferred to the "Catholic Youth" at that time, 40 of whom later became the backbone of the "Catholic Youth." Gong Pinmei used all kinds of shameless means of deception, appeasement, and buying off to drive the "Catholic Youth" members to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Some "Catholic Youth" members, under their drive, colluded with imperialist spies to engage in espionage activities. For example, Du Rongrong, Chen Hejing, and He Aiqian collected various military, political, and economic intelligence of our country and sent them to imperialist spies in Hong Kong, Japan, and other places. Some "Catholic Youth" members also acted as secret messengers for imperialist elements to smuggle across the border.
    The counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the "Catholic Youth" also organized various secret organizations specializing in subversive activities. The special agent organizations "China Teenagers Anti-Communist Comrades Revolutionary Committee," "National Salvation Revolutionary Party," and "Divine Eagle Party," which were successively cracked by the Shanghai public security organs in the Yulin District and Xuhui District of Shanghai in 1954 and 1955, were all composed of "Catholic Youth" members as the backbone. The "National Salvation Revolutionary Party" also developed 35 children of counter-revolutionary elements and rich peasant elements. They formulated a clear counter-revolutionary program, organized party members according to the form of the army, selected Chongming in Jiangsu, Dinghai in Zhejiang, and Shandong as armed bases for counter-revolution, and since 1951, they had sent "Catholic Youth" member Ni Shengde to actively carry out activities in Chongming. The reactionary organizations "China Teenagers Anti-Communist Comrades Revolutionary Committee" and "Divine Eagle Party," composed of core members of the "Catholic Youth," also carried out many blatant counter-revolutionary activities. For example, the former distributed reactionary leaflets and attempted to assassinate guards of government agencies and PLA soldiers in the Yulin District of Shanghai to seize weapons.
    In order to provide intelligence to imperialist intelligence agencies, the Gong Pinmei clique members also disguised themselves in various ways and mixed into state agencies and mass organizations.
    The counter-revolutionary activities of the Gong Pinmei clique were not limited to Shanghai, and they also sent many pawns to all parts of the country. The Gong Pinmei clique sent a person named Wang Yiru to mix into the Huaihe River Management Bureau to find out the various situations of the Huaihe River project. After the Gong Pinmei clique was cracked down this time, the Shanghai public security organs found a lot of materials stolen from the Huaihe River project department in the monastery, including important confidential documents such as the Huaihe River project plan and "Construction Instructions." Hou Zhizheng, Gong Pinmei's "legal advisor," collected information on the construction of the Northwest Railway through a member of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique who mixed into the Second Design Branch of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. Gong Pinmei also instructed his pawns to break into the rural regime "to serve as township cadres, militia captains, and heads of peasant associations," but "priests must firmly grasp control to avoid deterioration." Gong Pinmei sent a counter-revolutionary element named Jia Zhihao, who had just sneaked in from overseas, to Shijiazhuang, Zhengding, Baoding and other places, disguised as students and merchants, to establish secret liaison points in various places to collect intelligence. The Gong Pinmei clique also separately dispatched more than ten people, including Li Mingshu, to Beijing, Jinan, and other places to carry out rebellious activities. Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, said in his speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress: "In May 1953 and March 1954, two secret organizations engaged in rebellious activities in the name of Catholicism were cracked down in Xian County and Yongnian areas of Hebei. One hundred and several dozens of cellars, secret rooms, and mezzanine walls were found, and the largest cellar could accommodate more than one hundred people." The counter-revolutionary organization in the "Yongnian area" mentioned in it was contacted by Hou Zhizheng, the so-called "legal advisor" of Gong Pinmei.
    After the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique was cracked down, the Shanghai public security organs found a large number of evidences of espionage activities in the special agent's den of this clique, including secretly hidden transmitters and receivers for special agent work, telecommunications equipment hidden in the mezzanine floor, various types of short guns, bullets, etc. Among the evidences that have been seized, there are also the "Party Flag" and "Party Certificate" of the special agent organization "National Salvation Revolutionary Party" led by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, a large number of Kuomintang party flags, and many reactionary propaganda materials of the Kuomintang and the United States. All this fully proves that Gong Pinmei and other gangs of disguised so-called "missionaries" are completely a group of frantic counter-revolutionary bandits! (Attached pictures)

    帝国主义的工具
    ——龚品梅反革命集团罪行之一
    本报记者　季音
    上海人民在肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的伟大斗争中，在九月上旬又揭露了一个暗藏在天主教内的反革命集团——龚品梅反革命集团。
    这次斗争中揭发出来的许多事实证明，龚品梅反革命集团是帝国主义在我国进行颠覆活动的一个重要工具。这个反革命集团的核心分子都是帝国主义长期豢养、训练出来的忠实走狗。集团首脑龚品梅原是江苏省川沙县唐墓乡最大的一个地主。从他的祖父龚文观到他父亲（帝国主义分子“顺神甫”的跟班），都是依靠帝国主义势力，收高租、放高利贷、残酷剥削和敲诈农民起家的。龚品梅更直接走上了与中国人民为敌的反革命道路。长期以来，他按照帝国主义分子的指示，不断供给帝国主义以各种情报，接受帝国主义间谍活动经费。他隐藏了供进行特务工作用的收发报机、枪支子弹以及其他军用物资，用以从事反革命活动。他掩藏了大批国民党特务、大汉奸、恶霸地主等反革命分子，并指挥他的反革命集团猖狂地进行了颠覆中华人民共和国政府的活动。龚品梅反革命集团的核心分子之一、龚品梅的顾问张希斌，过去一贯勾结日本帝国主义、国民党反动派和美蒋特务，进行出卖祖国、残害人民的勾当。一九四八年张犯担任扬州震旦中学校长的时候，就同蒋贼警察局经常有电话联系，迫害进步学生。他在苏州有原中学和扬州震旦中学的时候，曾经强迫学生参加三青团，组织
  “学生宪兵”、“特训班”等反动组织，对学生进行法西斯训练。解放以后直到被捕为止，他一直进行着反革命活动。其他如龚品梅集团核心分子金鲁贤、傅鹤洲等，也都是大地主、大资本家出身。龚品梅集团的爪牙中，更有许多是国民党特务、反动军官、国民党反动政府的官僚、汉奸、地痞流氓等等。龚品梅集团就是这些社会渣滓和反动分子组成的。龚品梅等反革命分子和他们的主子——掩藏在上海天主教内的帝国主义分子，多少年来一直是反对革命人民的。在日寇侵占上海时期，上海教会里的帝国主义分子和反动分子公然欢宴日寇和汉奸，利用洋泾浜堂举行“日华阵亡将士追悼弥撒”，参加的不但有汉奸，而且有日本特务。一九四六年，正当国民党发动内战、物价高涨、民不聊生的时候，全国人民都恨透了卖国贼蒋介石，而当时天主教上海教区主教惠济良（Haouisee August）在告教友书中，却吹嘘蒋贼是“天主赐给中国的‘天才’”！
    这些人早就进行着破坏人民革命事业的准备。远在一九四六年七月十日，他们就召开了一次布置反革命活动的会议，参加会议的有龚品梅集团核心分子丁汝仁等九人。这次会议的记录题目是：
  “怎样对付共产党”。会议为“在红区内”（即解放区）和所谓“在自由区内”（即国民党统治区）的反动爪牙布置了任务，要“在红区内”的反动分子“必须尽可能留下”（即埋伏下来），并要隐蔽伪装；告诫在国民党统治区的爪牙及早作好各种反革命准备，“要认真的组织，巩固的训练各阶层青年教友使他们不中共产党的毒”。不久，帝国主义分子惠济良认为“是行动的时候到了”，为了更有效地进行反革命活动，他明确提出今后“必须要有一个勇敢的兵士组成的军团才行”。这个“军团”就是以后的龚品梅反革命集团。（以上所举的“怎样对付共产党”的会议记录和惠济良的指示两个反革命文件，都已经被上海公安局搜获）
    龚品梅就是在这样的情势下，在一九五○年八月被帝国主义分子宣布任命为“天主教上海教区主教”的，从此龚品梅和他的集团中的核心分子就在宗教外衣的掩盖下进一步干起了出卖祖国的卑鄙勾当。
    龚品梅集团的反革命活动是在帝国主义的指挥下进行的。已被我国驱逐出境的帝国主义间谍格寿平（Fernand　La Cretalle）就是龚品梅集团的直接指挥人之一。这个曾在我国进行了多年间谍活动的帝国主义分子，他的公开职业是龚品梅的“神学顾问”，上海“耶稣会会长”，实际上是龚品梅集团一切反革命活动的幕后决策人。格寿平在被捕后供认，他经常“以外国帝国主义方式帮助龚品梅反对人民政府所领导的各项运动”。“当我看到要展开一个新的运动时，我自己先研究这个问题，写一份拉丁文的答复，发给耶稣会神甫和龚主教，再由龚主教发给教区的神甫”。格寿平还供认，在一九五二年八月，人民政府注意到他们的犯罪行为的时候，龚品梅曾协同他消灭间谍活动的罪证，“把放在徐家汇‘档案室’的上海教区的档案全部销毁，销毁的目的是使政府得不到关于江南教区与外国领馆关系的老文件以及传教士们的通讯信件，在这些信件里，人们可以发现帝国主义的言辞”。
    龚品梅反革命集团长期以来利用天主教“上海教区”的宗教机构，勾结了许多帝国主义间谍特务，进行了搜集国家机密情报的特务活动。
    一九五二年七月被上海市人民政府逮捕的帝国主义间谍才尔孟（George Marie　AntoineGermain）就是和龚品梅直接勾结的。老牌国际间谍才尔孟远在一九三二年起，就在我国作间谍特务工作，刺探我红军及人民解放军军事情报。解放后这个国际间谍被龚品梅任命为“主教顾问”兼“主教府财务委员会主任”，在主教府中掩藏下来，继续进行他的老勾当。一九五二年上海市人民政府把这个国际间谍逮捕并驱逐出境，以后才尔孟在香港就成了龚品梅集团同帝国主义之间联系的联络点，龚品梅通过他继续把情报送到国外。才尔孟到香港后不断来信，一九五四年一月九日来信说：“多谢你们有趣的信，……代要的调查数字，我急于需要。”五月间又来信：“龚品梅寄来的资料收到了。”才尔孟为了酬答龚品梅等人，不断寄来大量活动经费。仅从一九五四年一月到一九五五年七月，经人民政府查明的不完全数字，才尔孟先后寄给了龚品梅活动经费美金六千五百零三元。
    一九五三年三月二十五日上海捕获的另一个帝国主义间谍田望霖（Alain　De　Terwagne），也是在龚品梅集团的掩护和帮助下进行间谍活动的。田望霖从一九五一年九月起，以传教为掩护从事间谍活动，刺探我国的政治、军事、经济机密，编成了三十份情报，用各种密码发到国外帝国主义情报机关。田望霖供认：“主教府是我的情报主要来源之一。”“傅鹤洲、李度（记者按：都是龚品梅集团的核心分子）都曾供给我有关上海、海门等地的情报。”田望霖还亲自对龚品梅的私人秘书沈保义进行了使用密码的训练，给了他使用密码的工具，目的是“以备万一被逐离开上海后，情报不致中断。”（田望霖供词）
    龚品梅集团还勾结、掩护了其他的许多帝国主义间谍分子。如美国间谍斐有文（Thomas　LeonardPhillips 美国籍，帝王堂神甫）曾供认：“上海解放后我将从堂口教徒处得来的情报供给翟光华（Charles Joseph　McCarthy）美国籍，耶稣会神学院副院长。”这里所说的“堂口”就是指为龚品梅集团把持的上海各个天主教堂。斐有文、翟光华通过这个关系，曾先后搜集了解放军伤兵医院驻地，保卫上海的解放军高射炮阵地，中国人民空军训练情况，飞机场所在地等许多军事情报，还搜集了上海物价，淮河运河水利工程，我国的水灾风灾情况等情报，以及国内各项爱国运动的情况。
    龚品梅集团是一个有严密组织的反革命集团，几年中他们以宗教招牌为掩护，发展了各种反革命组织。
    上海解放初期，上海天主教内的帝国主义分子曾以“圣母军”作为反革命活动的主要组织，对人民政府的各种措施进行破坏。一九五一年十月八日上海市军事管制委员会下令取缔反动组织“圣母军”，责令“圣母军”人员向政府登记退团。这时，龚品梅反革命集团一方面竭力阻止“圣母军”分子向政府登记，同时决定把大批“圣母军”分子转入另一个“公教青年”组织（简称“公青”），利用这一组织掩护他们继续进行反革命活动。据已查明的材料，当时转入“公青”的计有一百五十五名“圣母军”分子，其中有四十名以后全部成了“公青”的骨干。龚品梅用尽了一切欺骗、拢络、收买的无耻手段，驱使“公青”分子进行反革命活动。有的“公青”分子就在他们的驱使下勾结帝国主义间谍，从事特务活动，如杜融融、陈荷静、何爱谦等曾搜集我国的各种军事、政治、经济情报，送给在香港、日本等地的帝国主义间谍。有的“公青”分子还为帝国主义分子充任秘密交通，偷越国境。
    隐藏在“公青”中的反革命分子还组织了各种专门从事颠覆活动的秘密组织。一九五四年和一九五五年上海公安机关先后在上海榆林区、徐汇区破获的特务组织“中国少年反共同志革命委员会”、“救国革命党”、“神鹰党”等，就都是以“公青”分子为骨干组成的。“救国革命党”还发展了反革命分子的子弟、富农分子等三十五名，他们制定了明确的反革命纲领，按照军队形式编制党徒，选定江苏崇明、浙江定海以及山东等地作为反革命的武装根据地，并从一九五一年起就派遣“公青”分子倪圣德混入崇明积极进行活动。“公青”骨干分子组成的反动组织“中国少年反共同志革命委员会”、“神鹰党”等也进行了许多露骨的反革命活动。例如前者曾散发反动传单，在上海榆林区企图暗杀政府机关警卫人员和解放军战士，夺取武器。
    为了供给帝国主义情报机关以情报，龚品梅集团分子还多方伪装，混入国家机关和群众团体。
    龚品梅集团的反革命活动不只限于上海，它还派了许多爪牙到全国各地。龚品梅集团曾派一个叫王逸如的混入治淮工程局，探听治淮工程的各种情况。这次龚品梅集团破获后，上海公安机关在修道院中搜出了许多从治淮工程部门偷来的资料，其中包括治淮工程计划、“施工须知”等重要机密文件。龚品梅的“法律顾问”侯之正，通过一个混入铁道部设计总局第二设计分局的龚品梅反革命集团分子，搜集了西北铁路建设的情况。龚品梅还曾指示他的爪牙要打入乡村政权，“去担任乡干部、民兵队长、农会主任”，但要“神甫必须抓紧掌握，以免变质”。龚品梅曾派了一个才从海外混进来的反革命分子贾智浩到石家庄、正定、保定等地，乔装成学生和客商模样，在各地建立秘密联络点，收集情报。龚品梅集团也分别派遣了李明述等十多人到北京、济南等地进行叛乱活动。中华人民共和国公安部罗瑞卿部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中说到：“一九五三年五月和一九五四年三月，河北献县地区和永年地区破获了两起利用天主教名义进行叛乱活动的秘密组织，仅地洞、暗室、夹壁墙就查出了一百几十处，最大的地洞可容一百多人。”其中所讲的“永年地区”一起反革命组织，就是由龚品梅的所谓“法律顾问”侯之正负责联系的。
    龚品梅反革命集团被破获后，上海公安机关在这个集团的特务巢穴中查出了大量特务活动的罪证，其中有秘密隐藏的特务工作用的收发报机，藏在夹层地板里的电讯器材，各式短枪、子弹，等等。在已搜获的罪证中，还有龚品梅反革命集团领导的特务组织“救国革命党”的“党旗”、“党证”，大批国民党党旗，许多国民党和美国的反动宣传品。所有这些，完全证明了龚品梅等这群伪装的所谓“传教士”完全是一伙丧心病狂的反革命匪徒！（附图片）
