    Capitalist Countries' Workers' Movement
    Japanese "Sohyo" Struggles to Uphold Workers' Living Rights
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of its Standing Committee on November 25, and decided on various demands to be presented to the government in order to safeguard the living standards of workers. These demands include: granting government and public enterprise employees a year-end bonus equivalent to two months' salary, compiling a budget to increase wages, implementing a minimum wage system, increasing unemployment countermeasure funds, and providing necessary funds to small and medium-sized enterprises.
    "Sohyo" will soon send representatives to meet with Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama to demand that the government swiftly implement these demands.
    Japanese Public Sector Workers Demand Year-End Bonuses
    Approximately 900,000 employees of public utilities in Japan, including national postal services, national railways, telegraphs, and telephones, began taking action on November 24, demanding a year-end bonus equivalent to two months' salary.
    Because workers have been deprived of the right to strike by the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government, they are taking various forms of action. Workers of the National Railway Workers' Union and the Japan National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union are conducting struggles centered around 70 marshalling yards and freight stations nationwide, refusing overtime and holding one-hour workers' meetings day and night. Workers from unions such as the All-Communications Workers' Union, the All-Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union, and the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union are also taking actions such as taking leave, sit-ins, collective bargaining, holding rallies, and limiting production volume.
    This three-day struggle by the workers is part of a campaign planned by the Japan Council of Public Corporation Workers' Unions, which has more than two million members, to demand year-end bonuses.
    Large-Scale Strikes in Britain in the First Ten Months of This Year
    TASS, London, November 24: The strike movement of British workers is massive. According to the "Labour Gazette," the official organ of the Ministry of Labour, more than 615,000 workers participated in strikes in the first ten months of this year; whereas only 378,600 people took part in strikes during the same period last year.
    Three Thousand Construction Workers in Rome March Demanding Wage Increase
    Three thousand construction workers in Rome held a rally at the Italian General Confederation of Labour on November 22 to demand a wage increase. After the meeting, they marched in a procession to the Rome Provincial Government to petition the governor. However, the authorities dispatched hundreds of police officers to prevent the workers from advancing, and attacked the marchers with batons and water cannons.
    As a result of the conflict, approximately 35 marchers were injured; 30 people were arrested, six of whom have already been charged by the police authorities with "violent acts." (Xinhua News Agency)

    资本主义国家的工人运动
    日“总评”为维护工人生活权利而斗争
    日本工会总评议会十一月二十五日举行常任干事会会议，决定了向政府提出的维护工人生活的各项要求。这些要求包括：发给政府和公共企业机关工人以相当于两个月工资额的年终津贴，编制提高工资的预算，实施最低工资制，增加失业对策费用，对中小企业贷给必要的资金等。
    “总评”最近将派代表会见首相鸠山一郎，要求政府迅速实现这些要求。
    日本公共事业工人要求发给年终津贴
    日本全国邮政、国营铁道、电报、电话等公共事业机关的职工约九十万人，从十一月二十四日起开始采取行动，要求发给相当于两个月工资额的年终津贴。
    由于工人们被美国占领当局和日本政府剥夺了罢工的权利，他们采取各种方式来进行斗争。国营铁道工会和日本国营铁道机车工会的工人们一起，正在以全国七十个调车段和货车站为中心，进行拒绝加班和日夜各举行一小时工人大会等方式的斗争。全递信从业员工会、全专卖工会和全日本自治团体工会等工会的工人们，也采取了请假、静坐、集体谈判、举行大会和限定生产量等行动。
    工人们这次为期三天的斗争，是拥有二百多万会员的日本官公厅工会协议会准备发动的要求年终津贴运动的一部分。
    英国今年头十个月中罢工规模巨大
    据塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：英国工人的罢工运动规模巨大。据劳工部机关报“劳工部公报”说，在今年头十个月中，有六十一万五千多个工人参加了罢工；而在去年同期参加罢工的只有三十七万八千六百人。
    罗马三千建筑工人游行要求增加工资
    罗马三千个建筑工人为要求增加工资，十一月二十二日在意大利总工会会所举行集会，会后列队游行，到罗马省政府向省长请愿。但是，当局派来了上百个警察，阻止工人们前进，并且用警棍和水龙向游行者进攻。
    冲突结果，游行者约有三十五人受伤；有三十人被捕，其中六人已经被警察当局以“暴行”罪名起诉。　（据新华社讯）
