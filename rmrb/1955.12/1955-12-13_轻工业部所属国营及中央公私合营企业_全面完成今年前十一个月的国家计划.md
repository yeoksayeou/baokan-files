    State-owned and Central-State Joint Private Enterprises Under the Ministry of Light Industry
    Fully Complete the National Plan for the First Eleven Months of This Year
    (Our newspaper reports) The state-owned and central-state joint private enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry have fully completed the national plan for the first eleven months of this year. The total output value fulfilled 104% of the plan. The main products, labor productivity, profits turned over to the state, and cost plans have all reached the national targets. Among the enterprises under the five bureaus of papermaking, rubber, medicine, food, and sugar and wine, 48 new products have been successfully trial-produced this year. These new products have been identified by user departments as meeting the standards.
    Among the 121 factories under the Ministry of Light Industry, 48 factories, including the No. 3 Rubber Factory, Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, Daqing River Salt Administration, Qingdao Cigarette Factory, Beijing Brewery, and Shenyang Paper Mill, have completed their annual total output value plan ahead of schedule. Among the 48 major products, 14 products, including raw salt, phenacetin, printing paper, canned fruit, and rubber hoses, have completed the annual output plan ahead of schedule.
    The successful completion of the main indicators of the production plan of the Ministry of Light Industry is mainly due to the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in most enterprises after the April production meeting. This movement has enabled enterprises to achieve good results in saving raw materials, reducing costs, increasing output, and improving quality. As of the third quarter, the cigarette industry had saved 970,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves; the rubber industry had saved 432 tons of raw rubber. Products with increased production tasks throughout the year, such as table salt, newsprint, and phenacetin, have all completed the increased production plans. In addition, in the papermaking, pharmaceutical, and other enterprises, reasonable use of waste materials and adoption of substitutes have played a certain role in increasing production. The quality of most products has improved compared with the past. In order to further improve product quality, the Ministry of Light Industry is formulating product standards for rubber, papermaking, pharmaceutical, and other enterprises, universally revising process regulations, and strengthening technical supervision of raw materials, semi-finished products, and products.

    轻工业部所属国营及中央公私合营企业
    全面完成今年前十一个月的国家计划
    本报讯　轻工业部所属国营及中央公私合营企业，已全面完成今年前十一个月的国家计划。总产值完成计划百分之一百零四。主要产品、劳动生产率、上缴利润和成本计划都已达到国家指标。造纸、橡胶、医药、食品、糖酒等五个局所属企业中，并已在今年试制成功四十八种新产品，这些新产品经使用部门鉴定都符合标准。
    在轻工业部所属一百二十一个厂中，已有第三橡胶厂、上海第三药厂、大清河盐管处、青岛卷烟厂、北京啤酒厂、沈阳造纸厂等四十八个厂提前完成了全年总产值计划。在四十八种主要产品中，已有原盐、非那昔丁、印刷纸、果类罐头和胶管等十四种产品提前完成了全年产量计划。
    轻工业部生产计划各主要指标的胜利完成，主要是由于四月生产会议后，大多数企业开展了增产节约运动。这个运动使各企业在节约原材料、降低成本、增加产量、提高质量等方面获得良好效果。卷烟工业截至第三季度即节约了九十七万公斤烟叶；橡胶工业节约了生胶四百三十二吨。全年订有增产任务的产品如食盐、新闻纸、非那昔丁等都完成增产计划。此外，在造纸、医药等企业中还合理地利用了废料，采用代用品，对提高产量起了一定作用。多数产品的质量较过去提高。为了进一步改进产品质量，轻工业部正在制定橡胶、造纸、医药等企业的产品标准，普遍修订工艺规程，并且加强对原料、半成品和产品的技术监督。
