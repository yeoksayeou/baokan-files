    Changes in a Backward Village
    Jiao Dechang
    Bitou Village was originally a backward village in Dazinzhuang Township, Lu'an County, Shanxi Province. After party rectification and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the face of this backward village has been rapidly changing. As the peasants say, there is now more mutual aid and cooperation, more diligent production, and more people with surplus grain. By next year, this village will basically achieve cooperativization, with more than 70 percent of farm households participating in cooperatives.

    Rectifying the Party Ranks
    The Bitou Village Party Branch was established in 1946. Because ideological education of the Party couldn’t keep up, most Party members were still selfish and unwilling to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations; a few Party members even lost their stand and were used by landlords and rich peasants. At the same time, actively working Party members did not receive support and praise. The political situation in this village was very complex, with about 70 percent of the people in the village having participated in reactionary secret societies, including thirteen who were leaders of Yiguandao. After the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and ban reactionary secret societies, some of the former leaders and some reactionary landlords and rich peasants combined to incite backward masses to openly oppose the Party's and the state's policies, and undermine the cooperative movement. Niu Xingsheng, a reactionary rich peasant and Yiguandao leader, said to the masses: "We haven't starved to death without organizing for so many years. Mutual aid and cooperation are useless." As a result, some backward masses were unwilling to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In the spring of 1954, when the Party branch was mobilizing the peasants to fight drought and plant seeds, Dong Anren (a doctor), an Yiguandao follower, used the method of inciting the peasants to perform operas and tell stories to sabotage the drought resistance movement. The village continuously told stories for more than half a month, and many peasants missed the drought resistance planting.

    In the winter of 1954, the Lu'an County Party Committee first concentrated all the Party members of this branch in the County Party School for more than half a month of study, explained to them the socialist future and the eight criteria for Party members. Then the County Party Committee sent a work team to help the Party branch of this village carry out party rectification and improve the work in the village. After studying the instructions of the Central Committee and the higher-level Party committee on party rectification and the transformation of backward villages, the work team and the Party branch determined to first rectify the Party organization, solve the main problems within the branch, so as to improve the combat effectiveness of the branch; and then mobilize the peasants to expose and combat the feudal remnants and counter-revolutionary forces in the village. Finally, under the high enthusiasm of the peasants in the anti-feudal struggle, the peasants were guided to the mutual aid and cooperative movement.

    After studying at the Party School, the ideological level of the Party members in the village had been improved to a certain extent. On this basis, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and various erroneous ideas were exposed and criticized. All Party members carried out a serious ideological struggle against Zhang Maoze and Niu Lianzhi, who had lost their class stand, and Zhang Jixiang, who violated laws and discipline, and gave these three Party members serious punishments (Niu Lianzhi and Zhang Jixiang still did not perform well after being punished and have been expelled from the Party). At the same time, five Party members, including Guo Youzhi and Zhang Baoyou, who had a firm stand, resolute struggle, and active work, were commended. In this way, the Party members reflected very well: "Our branch has never been so clear about merits and demerits." Finally, the branch committee was re-elected, and Cheng Suoze and Zhang Xianmao, the incompetent branch committee members, were removed from the leadership positions of the branch, and Zhang Lianze and Zhang Baoyou, the Party members who were active in work, had a correct work style, and could lead the masses to actively take the socialist road, were appointed as branch committee members, establishing a strong leadership core.

    Overthrowing Counter-Revolutionary Forces
    After party rectification, all Party members actively publicized the Party's general line and the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to the peasants, so that the peasants quickly recognized who they should support and who they should oppose. As a result, the mass anti-feudal struggle of the peasants was rapidly launched, and they exposed and accused the crimes of reactionary landlords and rich peasants one after another. Even those who never attended mass meetings participated in the mass accusation meeting. Seventy-nine people in the village reported ninety-four facts of counter-revolutionary activities of the reactionary rich peasant Yiguandao Niu Xingsheng and Yiguandao Dong Anren and others, including six cases of sabotaging agricultural production, twenty-eight cases of creating rumors, seven cases of sabotaging various policies, and seventeen cases of seizing the fruits of struggle and beating up emancipated peasants. Moreover, because the branch correctly implemented the policy of "combining suppression and leniency," some accomplices quickly confessed and exposed counter-revolutionary elements, and turned into a force against counter-revolutionary elements. For example, Zhang Quanze, who colluded with counter-revolutionary elements, not only bowed his head to admit his mistakes to the peasants, but also exposed the facts that the rich peasant Zhang Heshun and the Yiguandao leader attacked Party cadres. At the active request of the peasants, the government arrested five people, including the reactionary rich peasant Yiguandao Niu Xingsheng and Dong Anren, according to law. This was a fierce class struggle, which greatly demonstrated the power of the peasants. The peasants reflected one after another: "We saw the clear sky for the second time."

    Organizing Cooperatives
    After party rectification and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, not only the enthusiasm of poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist road has been greatly improved, but also rich peasants have expressed their willingness to follow the Communist Party. As a result, the village saw the first agricultural production cooperative composed of 29 poor and lower-middle peasant households. The Party branch also rectified eleven mutual aid teams, and a heat wave of bumper harvest competitions was set off in the village.

    This year, in order to carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the whole village, the Party first studied the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and the class line, and improved the leadership level of the branch cadres and Party members. In the spring, some middle peasant members disliked the poor land and livestock of the poor peasant members and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. After learning about this situation, the branch conducted education among the members on unity and development of production between poor and middle peasants, and paid attention to implementing the mutual benefit policy when dealing with economic issues. The middle peasants felt that they would not suffer losses when they heard that land, livestock and other farm tools would be reasonably rewarded, and began to actively produce. Zhang Kuanxin, a middle peasant, went to the fields very early every day to produce, which drove most of the middle peasant members to work hard to produce.

    In the summer, the peasants saw the superiority of agricultural cooperatives with their own eyes, and they discussed joining the cooperative. The expansion of the cooperative was discussed at a Party members' meeting in August. Everyone first affirmed that under the correct leadership of the Party branch, this year's cooperative was doing well and needed to be expanded after autumn. However, some Party members had conservative ideas and did not advocate expanding the cooperative. For example, Guo Youzhi (director of the cooperative), a member of the branch committee, believed that a small cooperative could be built separately after autumn, and the old cooperative should not be expanded. Guo Youzhi's reason was that the old cooperative had not been consolidated for long, and it would be chaotic again to receive a new batch of members; the cadres could not lead if the cooperative was too large. Zhang Lianze, the secretary of the branch, and five other Party members disagreed with this view, believing that expanding the cooperative was much easier than building a new small cooperative. After the expansion, the cadres would be concentrated and easier to lead. After the debate, the resolution to expand the cooperative was finally passed.

    "Poor Three-More" has become "Rich Three-More"
    Under the active leadership of the Party branch, the production competition was carried out with the cooperative leading the team. In 1955, all the cooperatives and mutual aid teams achieved bumper harvests. After more than 90 percent of the farmers in the village were organized, the first thing that changed was the situation that about 50 percent of the land in the village was not plowed or harrowed when planting in spring. This spring, more than 85 percent of the land was plowed and harrowed once. In the past, the autumn seedlings were only weeded once, but this year, the cooperatives and teams generally weeded twice or even three times. Secondly, improved varieties were promoted and dense planting was carried out. Because the Party branch grasped the Party's mutual benefit policy and class policy, and solved the problems occurring in the cooperatives and teams in a timely manner, the enthusiasm of poor and middle peasants for united production was constantly enhanced, ensuring a bumper harvest in the whole village in 1955. After the cooperatives and mutual aid teams achieved bumper harvests, the living standards of the peasants have also improved. There were still 17 households short of food between this spring and summer, but now there are no households short of food. Therefore, the peasants reflected: "In the past, there were three-more in our village: more hired workers, more lazy people, and more households short of food; now there are also three-more: more cooperation and mutual assistance, more diligent production, and more people with surplus grain. Three-more became three-more, and poor three-more became rich three-more."

    After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," all Party members further criticized right-leaning ideas and greatly enhanced their confidence in running the cooperative. The Party branch decided that in 1956, more than 70 percent of the farmers in the whole township would participate in the cooperative, and in 1957, about 90 percent of the farmers participating in the cooperative would be reached.

    一个落后村的变化
    焦德昌
    壁头村原是山西潞安县大辛庄乡的一个落后村。经过整党和镇压反革命，这个落后村的面貌就迅速改变着，正如农民群众说的，现在是互助合作多，勤劳生产的人多，有余粮的人多。这个村到明年就可以达到基本上合作化，有百分之七十以上的农户参加合作社。
    整顿党的队伍
    壁头村党支部是在一九四六年建立的，因为党的思想教育跟不上去，多数党员还自私自利，不愿参加互助合作组织；少数党员甚至丧失立场，被地主、富农所利用。同时，工作积极的党员也得不到支持和表扬。这个村的政治情况非常复杂，全村百分之七十左右的人，参加过反动会道门组织，其中有十三个还是一贯道的坛主。经过镇压反革命运动和取缔反动会道门组织之后，仍有部分道首和一些反动的地主、富农结合起来，煽动落后群众公开地反对党和国家的各项政策，破坏合作化运动。反动富农、一贯道坛主牛兴盛对群众说：“多少年来没有组织起来，也没有饿死，互助合作不顶啥用。”有些落后群众因此就不愿参加互助合作组织。一九五四年春季党支部正发动农民群众抗旱下种，一贯道徒董安仁（医生）就用煽动农民群众唱戏、说书的办法来破坏抗旱运动，村里一连说了半个多月书，许多农民群众误了抗旱下种。
    一九五四年冬季，潞安县委把这个支部的全体党员先集中到县委党校进行了半个多月的学习，对他们讲解了社会主义前途和党员标准八个问题，接着县委又派了一个工作组帮助这个村的党支部进行整党，改进村里的工作。工作组和党支部在研究中央和上级党委有关整党工作和改造落后乡村工作的指示后，确定首先整顿党的组织，解决支部内的主要问题，以提高支部的战斗力；然后再去发动农民群众，揭发和打击村里的封建残余势力和反革命势力。最后在农民群众的反封建斗争的热情高涨之下，把农民群众引向互助合作运动方面来。
    村里的党员在党校学习后，思想水平已有了一定的提高，在这个基础上，就开展了批评和自我批评，对各种错误思想进行了揭发和批判。全体党员对丧失阶级立场的张毛则、牛联枝和违法乱纪的张吉祥进行了严肃的思想斗争，并给这三个党员以严重的处分（牛联枝和张吉祥处分后仍然表现不好，已被开除出党）。同时表扬了立场坚定，斗争坚决，工作积极的党员郭有枝、张保有等五人。这样，党员们反映很好：“咱们支部从来没有这样功过分明。”最后改选了支部委员会，把不称职的支部委员成锁则、张先毛两人从支部领导岗位上撤换下来，由工作积极、作风正派、能领导群众积极走社会主义道路的党员张联则和张保有担任支部委员，建立起一个坚强的领导核心。
    斗倒反革命势力
    整党之后，全体党员积极地向农民群众宣传党的总路线和镇压反革命的政策，使农民群众很快认清了应该拥护谁，反对谁。于是农民群众性的反封建斗争就迅速开展起来，纷纷揭发和控诉了反动地主、富农的罪行，连从来不参加群众大会的人也参加了群众控诉大会。全村有七十九人检举出反动富农一贯道牛兴盛和一贯道徒董安仁等人的九十四件反革命活动事实，其中包括破坏农业生产的六件，造谣生事的二十八件，破坏各项政策的七件，夺取斗争果实和打骂翻身农民的十七件。又由于支部正确地执行了“镇压和宽大相结合”的政策，使一些胁从分子迅速坦白和检举反革命分子，变成了反对反革命分子的力量。例如同反革命分子有勾结的张全则，不但向农民群众低头承认错误，而且还揭发了富农张和顺和一贯道坛主打击党员干部等事实。在农民群众的积极要求下，由政府依法逮捕了反动富农一贯道坛主牛兴盛、董安仁等五人。这是一场剧烈的阶级斗争，大大地显示了农民群众的威力。农民群众纷纷反映：“我们第二次见到了晴天。”
      组织合作社
    经过整党和镇压反革命，不但贫苦农民走社会主义道路的积极性大大提高，而且富裕农民也表示愿意跟着共产党走。于是这个村出现了第一个由二十九户贫农和下中农组成的农业生产合作社。党支部又整顿了十一个互助组，全村掀起了丰产竞赛的热潮。
    今年为了开展全村互助合作运动，党内首先学习了自愿互利政策和阶级路线，提高了支部干部和党员的领导水平。春季，中农社员嫌贫农社员的土地、牲口不好，要想退社。支部了解这一情况后，就在社员中进行了贫农、中农团结发展生产的教育，在处理经济问题的时候，注意贯彻执行互利政策。中农听到土地、牲口和其它农具都有合理的报酬，感到自己也不吃亏，就开始积极生产起来。中农张宽新每天很早就下地生产，这就带动了大部分中农社员努力生产。
    夏季农民亲眼看到了农业合作社生产的优越性，纷纷酝酿入社。八月份的一次党员大会上就展开了扩社问题的讨论。大家首先肯定了在党支部的正确领导下，今年的合作社办的还好，秋后需要扩大。但有些党员有保守思想，不主张扩社，如支部委员郭有枝（合作社主任），认为秋后可以另建一个小社，老社不宜扩大。郭有枝的理由是老社巩固不久，再接收一批新社员又要混乱；社大了干部也领导不了。支部书记张联则等五个党员不同意这种看法，认为扩社要比新建一个小社容易得多。扩大后，干部集中，也好领导。经过争论，终于通过了扩社的决议。
      “穷三多”变成了“富三多”
    在党支部的积极领导下，以社带组开展了生产竞赛，一九五五年合作社和互助组全部获得了丰产。在全村百分之九十以上的农户组织起来以后，首先是改变了这个村百分之五十左右的土地在春季下种不耕不耙的情况，今春百分之八十五以上的土地耕耙了一次。历年来秋苗只锄一次，今年社、组普遍锄两次甚至锄三次。其次，推广了良种，进行了密植。由于党支部掌握了党的互利政策和阶级政策，及时地解决社、组内发生的问题，使贫农和中农团结生产的劲头不断增强，保证了全村一九五五年的丰产。合作社、互助组获得丰产后，农民群众的生活水平也都有了提高，今年春夏之间还有十七户缺粮吃，现在已经没有缺粮户。因此农民群众反映：“过去咱村是三多：雇工多，懒汉多，缺粮户多；现在也是三多：合作互助多，勤劳生产的人多，有余粮的人多，三多变三多，穷三多变成了富三多。”
    在学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告后，全体党员进一步批判了右倾思想，办社信心百倍增强。党支部决定一九五六年将使全乡百分之七十以上的农户参加合作社，一九五七年参加合作社的农户将达到百分之九十左右。
