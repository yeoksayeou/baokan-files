Heilongjiang Province leadership organs, according to the new situation of the basic realization of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation in the province, requested that the total grain output of the province in 1956 increase by 1.6 billion jin compared with 1955, achieving the agricultural production targets set by the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. To achieve this requirement, in 1956 the province will organize agricultural production cooperatives, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations to expand the planting area by 450,000 hectares, increase the irrigation area by 60,000 hectares, increase the area cultivated with new-style animal-powered farm implements, expand the planting area of high-yield crops, and further improve cultivation techniques. At present, all localities are actively preparing to implement these measures.

The total grain output of Heilongjiang Province this year (including potatoes) reached 8.2 million tons, exceeding the original plan by 8.84 percent, an increase of 16 percent over last year. The grain yield per unit area also increased by 15.5 percent over last year. The main reasons for the increase in grain production in the province this year are that the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives has greatly increased compared with last year, the Party and government organs at all levels have correctly implemented the grain "three fix" policy, and effective measures to increase production have been implemented. Driven by agricultural cooperatives, the province expanded cultivated land by more than 26,000 hectares, promoted high-yield crops such as rice by more than 19,000 hectares, corn by more than 280,000 hectares, and promoted improved varieties of wheat and improved varieties of rice by 129,000 hectares. In addition, the area cultivated with new farm implements was expanded, and cultivation techniques were improved.

    黑龙江明年可实现五年计划农业增产指标
    黑龙江省领导机关根据全省已经基本上实现半社会主义农业合作化的新形势，要求一九五六年全省粮食总产量比一九五五年增加十六亿斤，提前一年实现第一个五年计划规定的农业生产指标。为了达到这个要求，一九五六年全省将组织农业生产合作社、国营农场、农业机器站扩大播种面积四十五万公顷，增加灌溉面积六万公顷，增加新式畜力农具耕作面积，扩大高产作物种植面积和进一步改进耕作技术。目前各地正在为实现这些措施积极进行准备工作。
    黑龙江省今年粮食总产量（包括薯类在内）达到八百二十万吨，超过原定计划百分之八点八四，比去年增产百分之十六。粮食单位面积产量也比去年提高百分之十五点五。今年全省粮食增产的原因，主要是参加农业生产合作社的农民比去年大为增加，各级党政机关正确地贯彻执行了粮食
  “三定”政策，同时实行了有效的增产措施。在农业合作社的带动下，全省今年扩大耕地面积二万六千多公顷，推广高产作物水稻一万九千多公顷、玉米二十八万多公顷，推广良种小麦和良种水稻十二万九千多公顷。此外，还扩大了新农具的耕作面积，改进了耕作技术。
