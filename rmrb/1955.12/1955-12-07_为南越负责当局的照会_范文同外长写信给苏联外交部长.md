Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 6th. Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, regarding the note of the responsible authorities of South Vietnam. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellency Chairman:

I have the honor to inform you that I have received the note of October 7, 1955, from the responsible authorities of South Vietnam, which you forwarded to me.

Please accept my gratitude.

In the aforementioned note of October 7, 1955, the responsible authorities of South Vietnam expressed their position on the Geneva Accords and the implementation of these accords. Their views are completely without any valuable basis. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes it is necessary to express the following opinions on this matter:

1.  The South Vietnamese authorities, using the excuse that they did not conclude the Geneva Accords, believe that they are not bound by the Geneva Accords. We believe it is necessary to refute this argument. The fact is that the Geneva Accords, especially the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, were negotiated and concluded by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on one side and the French Government on the other. The French government signed on its own behalf and on behalf of the responsible authorities of South Vietnam. This is precisely how the work of the Geneva Conference was conducted.

In the implementation of the various clauses of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, namely the clauses on the regrouping and transfer of troops, the transfer of administrative management, etc., the facts are also the same. The South Vietnamese responsible authorities implemented them together with the relevant French authorities. The South Vietnamese authorities took over the vast areas of South Vietnam transferred by the Vietnam People's Army, which means that they have recognized the Geneva Accords.

Therefore, the French government and the South Vietnamese regime bear joint responsibility for implementing the Geneva Accords. Precisely to guard against all possible events, Article 27 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam explicitly stipulates: "The signatories to this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for observing and implementing the various clauses and provisions of this Agreement."

2.  The South Vietnamese responsible authorities assert that the Geneva Accords, especially Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, "only mentioned consultations and did not mention consultative conferences." It should be emphasized that, according to the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnamese regime must reach an agreement on all issues related to the preparation and organization of free general elections. Because this is a complex issue, the two sides can only resolve it in a consultative conference. Therefore, the "consultations" mentioned in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference actually refer to "consultative conferences."

3.  The South Vietnamese responsible authorities raise the excuse that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will not take the necessary guarantees for a truly free and democratic general election. This argument is completely contrary to the facts. The people of North Vietnam enjoy all democratic freedoms. This is precisely why the Democratic Republic of Vietnam enjoys immense prestige among the entire Vietnamese people.

As for the guarantees for free general elections stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stated in its report to the Fifth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: "The basic principle of general elections is: to hold free general elections nationwide in accordance with the principles of universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot. In accordance with the provisions of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, the general elections will be supervised by the International Supervisory and Control Commission composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada."

In this way, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has agreed to take the necessary guarantees for a truly free and democratic general election, and it is only necessary for both sides to reach an agreement on the implementation of this principle, and this issue can only be resolved in a consultative conference.

The South Vietnamese authorities, disregarding the clear provisions of the Geneva Accords, have abolished all democratic freedoms (freedom of person, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, etc.) in South Vietnam. They are retaliating against former resistance personnel, violating the Geneva Accords, as the International Commission has repeatedly confirmed. The acts of terror and repression in the so-called "referendum" organized by the South Vietnamese responsible authorities on October 23, 1955, once again prove and accuse the dictatorial nature of the South Vietnamese regime.

In fact, the reasons cited by the South Vietnamese authorities to reject the consultative conference are merely to cover up their conspiracy aimed at systematically undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The so-called "referendum" held by the South Vietnamese authorities on October 23, 1955, is an extremely blatant violation of the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. These articles stipulate that the military demarcation line is only temporary and cannot be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary, and that the national system of Vietnam will be established by free general elections.

We also declare that the so-called "constitution" and "national assembly" that the South Vietnamese authorities are planning to realize in South Vietnam are very clear violations of the Geneva Accords.

In summary, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the South Vietnamese responsible authorities bear full responsibility for the Geneva Accords, and the reasons they cited in the note of October 7, 1955, are completely unfounded.

Taking this opportunity, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again refers to the letter of August 17, 1955, in which the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to ensure the resolution of the political problems of Vietnam and, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, to convene a consultative conference of representative responsible authorities of North and South Vietnam.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people demand a swift resolution to this issue.

Please forward this letter to the British Foreign Secretary - Chairman of the Geneva Conference on Indochina.

I also suggest to the two chairmen that, if deemed necessary, please send this letter to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference on Indochina.

Please accept my respects,

Pham Van Dong
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
November 25, 1955

### 为南越负责当局的照会  范文同外长写信给苏联外交部长

    为南越负责当局的照会
    范文同外长写信给苏联外交部长
    新华社河内六日讯　越南民主共和国政府外交部长范文同为南越负责当局的照会给苏联外交部长——印度支那问题日内瓦会议主席的信，全文如下：主席阁下：
    我荣幸地通知您，我已收到由您转给我的南越负责当局一九五五年十月七日的照会。
    请您接受我的谢意。
    在上述一九五五年十月七日的照会中，南越负责当局就日内瓦协定和这个协定的履行表示了自己的立场。他们的观点完全没有任何有价值的基础。越南民主共和国政府认为必须就这个问题表示下列的意见：
    一、南越当局以他们没有缔结日内瓦协定为借口，认为他们不受日内瓦协定的束缚。我们认为必须驳斥这样的论调。事实是：日内瓦协定尤其是越南停止敌对行动协定是由越南民主共和国政府一方和法国政府一方协商和缔结的，法国政府是为自己本身同时代表南越负责当局签字的，日内瓦会议的工作正是这样进行的。
    在执行越南停止敌对行动协定各条款中，即军队的集结和转移、行政管理的移交等条款，事实也是如此，南越负责当局是同法国有关当局一起履行的，南越当局接管了由越南人民军移交的南越广大地区，这就意味着他们已承认了日内瓦协定。
    因此，法国政府和南越政权对履行日内瓦协定是负有连带责任的。正是为了提防可能发生的一切事情，越南停止敌对行动协定第二十七条明确地规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继任人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定。”
    二、南越负责当局断言日内瓦协定、尤其是日内瓦会议最后宣言第七条“只提到协商而没有提到协商会议”。应该强调指出，据日内瓦协定规定，越南民主共和国政府和南越政权必须就自由普选的准备和组织有关的一切问题取得协议。因为这是一个复杂的问题，所以双方只能在协商会议中解决之。因此，日内瓦会议最后宣言所提到的“协商”，实际上是指“协商会议”而言。
    三、南越负责当局提出借口说，越南民主共和国政府将不会为一个真正自由和民主的普选采取必要的保证。这个论调完全和事实相反。北越人民享受着一切民主自由权利。这正是为什么越南民主共和国在全体越南人民中享有无比巨大的威望的缘故。
    至于对日内瓦协定规定的自由普选的保证，越南民主共和国政府在越南民主共和国国民大会第五次会议上的报告中已经表示：“普选的基本原则是：按照普遍、平等、直接和不记名投票的原则在全国举行自由普选。按照日内瓦会议最后宣言的规定，将由包括印度、波兰、加拿大三国代表组成的国际监督和监察委员会监督普选。”
    这样，越南民主共和国政府已经同意为一个真正自由和民主的普选采取必要的保证，只需双方就实现这个原则取得协议，而这个问题只能在协商会议中获得解决。
    南越当局方面不顾日内瓦协定的明确规定，他们在南越取消一切民主自由权利（人身自由、言论、出版等自由）。他们对前抗战人员进行报复，违背日内瓦协定，正像国际委员会曾经屡次所证实的那样。由南越负责当局在一九五五年十月二十三日组织的所谓“公民投票”中的恐怖和镇压行动再次证明和控诉了南越制度的独裁性质。
    事实上，南越当局所援引来拒绝协商会议的理由，完全只是为了掩护它旨在有系统地破坏日内瓦协定的履行的阴谋。南越当局在一九五五年十月二十三日所举行的所谓“公民投票”，是对日内瓦会议最后宣言第六条和第七条的规定的一个极其明显的违反行动。这些条款规定军事分界线只是临时性的，完全不能解释为政治的或领土的边界，并且越南的国家制度将由自由普选来建立。
    我们也声明，南越当局所正在打算在南越实现的所谓“宪法”和“国会”都是对日内瓦协定的非常明显的违反。
    总而言之，越南民主共和国政府认为南越负责当局对日内瓦协定是完全负有责任的，他们在一九五五年十月七日照会中所援引的理由是完全没有根据的。
    趁此机会，越南民主共和国政府再次提到一九五五年八月十七日的信，在信中，越南民主共和国政府要求日内瓦会议的两位主席采取一切必要的措施，以保证解决越南的政治问题和按照日内瓦协定的规定，召开越南北方和南方有代表性的负责当局的协商会议。
    越南民主共和国政府和越南人民要求迅速解决这个问题。
    请主席把这封信转交给英国外交大臣——印度支那问题日内瓦会议主席。
    我也向两位主席建议，如果认为必要，请把这封信寄给印度支那问题日内瓦会议的各与会国。
    请主席接受我的敬意。
      越南民主共和国外交部长　范文同
                一九五五年十一月二十五日
