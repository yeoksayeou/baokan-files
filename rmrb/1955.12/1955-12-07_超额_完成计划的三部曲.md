Title: The Three-Part Sonata of “Exceeding” the Plan

The factories under the Shenyang Municipal Public Utilities Bureau (including the tram factory, automobile factory, gas factory, waterworks, etc.) perform almost annually in the process of executing the national production plan in a three-part sonata: it starts with complaining about "hardship," then "reduction," and finally "exceeding" the plan. This year is no exception. In the third quarter, all factories generally reduced their annual plans. The annual profit plan for the entire bureau alone was reduced by 18.8 percent. However, by the end of October, the entire bureau had completed more than 101 percent of the revised annual profit plan. It is very obvious that by the end of the year, the national plan can be greatly "exceeded."

The plan is "unachievable" one moment, and greatly "exceeded" the next. Is this volatile situation due to the fact that these business leaders are all confused? No, they are never confused when it comes to matters that benefit their businesses. Taking the tram factory as an example, the unit kilometer cost plan at the beginning of the year was reduced by 6.4 percent compared with last year, and the actual reduction in the first half of this year was 9.22 percent. However, this factory still sandbagged the state and reduced the plan. In the third quarter, the actual result was a reduction of 19.42 percent. This suppressed plan allows them to "exceed" it very pleasantly and easily without taking risks or breaking a sweat. However, what is strange is that the Shenyang Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, as the leading authority, nods and agrees as soon as these business leaders complain. Taking such a lenient bureaucratic attitude towards the national plan is a dereliction of duty. The people can no longer tolerate this phenomenon of playing with the national plan and will never allow the "three-part sonata" to be played again.

### “超额”完成计划的三部曲

    “超额”完成计划的三部曲
    沈阳市公用局所属各厂（包括电车厂、汽车厂、煤气厂、自来水厂等厂）差不多每年在执行国家的生产计划的过程中都要唱这样的三部曲：开始时是叫“苦”，接着是“削减”，而最后都是“超额”完成。今年也不例外。第三季度各厂普遍削减了年度计划。仅全局年度利润计划就降低了百分之十八点八。但是，到十月末全局已完成了修改后的年度利润计划的百分之一百零一以上。非常明显，到年底一定可以大大“超额”完成国家计划了。
    计划一会儿是“完不成”，一会又是大大的
  “超额完成”，如此变幻莫测，是不是由于这些企业领导者都是糊涂人呢？不是的。他们对自己企业能占便宜的事是从来不糊涂的。以电车厂为例，年初单位公里成本计划较去年降低百分之六点四，今年上半年实际已降低百分之九点二二。可是这个厂却向国家打了埋伏，还是削减了计划。到第三季度，实际执行的结果是降低了百分之十九点四二。这种压低了的计划，既不要担风险，也不用淌一滴汗，就可以十分愉快和轻松的“超额完成”。但是，令人奇怪的是，作为领导机关的沈阳市公用局，每当这些企业领导者一叫喊，就连忙跟着点头同意。对国家计划采取这种纵容的官僚主义态度，是一种失职的行为。人民对这种玩忽国家计划的现象是不能再容忍了，决不允许再唱“三部曲”了。
