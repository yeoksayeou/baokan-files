China's Hydropower Resources and the Favorable Conditions for Building Hydropower Stations
Assistant Minister of Electric Power Industry, Li Rui

China is one of the countries in the world with the richest hydropower resources. This is due to China's vast territory, abundant rainfall, and the terrain being high in the west and low in the east, with many large rivers traversing the plateaus, mountains, and hills that occupy two-thirds of the country's area. At the same time, China's hydropower resource development – the technical and economic conditions for building hydropower stations – are very favorable, surpassing those of many countries in some aspects. There is no doubt that the superior hydropower resources and their development will play an increasingly active and significant role in China's socialist construction and the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, and other fields.

How much hydropower resource does China actually have? In the past, the figure often cited was 150 million kilowatts. This figure was an estimate made before the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, the materials were limited, and it was obviously underestimated. In order to adapt to the development of China's economic construction, since 1955, the hydropower survey and design departments of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry have re-estimated the country's hydropower resources based on the various materials currently available. The scope of this estimate includes a total of 1,598 larger rivers across the country, with a total drainage area accounting for more than 70 percent of the country's total area; a total river length of more than 226,000 kilometers, and a total annual water volume of approximately 2,680 billion cubic meters (i.e., 2,680 cubic kilometers). According to the estimation within this scope, the theoretical total reserve of China's hydropower resources, calculated based on the average flow of rivers, is approximately 540 million kilowatts. If the utilization factor is calculated at 50 to 60 percent (considering that in actual development, a portion of the head and flow will inevitably be lost; the Soviet Hydropower Design Institute once adopted this coefficient), then China's usable hydropower resources, calculated based on average flow, are approximately 300 million kilowatts. Due to insufficient data, this estimation can only illustrate an outline or trend; relevant data still needs to be revised based on data accumulated in future long-term work.

The distribution of this theoretical hydropower reserve of 540 million kilowatts across the country's water systems is roughly as follows: the Yangtze River system accounts for 40 percent, the Tibetan water system accounts for 21.5 percent, the Southwest International water system accounts for 16.7 percent, the Yellow River system accounts for 6 percent, the Pearl River system accounts for 5.2 percent, the Southeast coastal water system (including Taiwan and Hainan Island) accounts for 3.8 percent, the Gansu-Qinghai-Xinjiang inland water system accounts for 3.2 percent, the Northeast water system accounts for 3.3 percent, and the North China Haihe and Luanhe water system accounts for 0.3 percent. Therefore, in terms of regional distribution, 72 percent of China's hydropower resources are concentrated in the southwest region; North China and Inner Mongolia have the least, less than 2 percent.

According to each river system, China's hydropower resources are the largest in the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is China's largest river, with a drainage area of 1.94 million square kilometers (including the part of the Huai River basin that flows into the sea), an average flow at the river mouth of 32,500 cubic meters per second, and a total annual water volume of over 1 trillion cubic meters. The total head of the Yangtze River's mainstream is 5,000 meters. Its main tributaries, the Min River, Jialing River, Wu River, Yuan River, Zi River, and Han River, all have huge hydropower resources. In terms of flow, the Yangtze River ranks fourth among the world's largest rivers; in terms of hydropower reserves, the Yangtze River ranks third among the world's largest rivers, much larger than the published hydropower resources of various capitalist countries: such as the United States with 85 million kilowatts, Canada with 57 million kilowatts, Norway with 20 million kilowatts, France with 8.9 million kilowatts, and Italy with 6 million kilowatts. The hydropower resources of the Yellow River's mainstream from Longyang Gorge to the estuary section have been divided into 46 cascade developments according to the principle of comprehensive utilization. The head utilization rate reaches 83 percent. The future problem of the Yellow River is that the water volume is too small. The water volume of many tributaries of the Yangtze River is much larger than that of the Yellow River. Therefore, one day, the Yellow River will have to borrow water from the Yangtze River. Most of the Huai River basin passes through plain areas, and the midstream tributaries converge from the north and south in a fan shape, which easily causes flood blockage, and the hydropower resources are less than 1 million kilowatts. Most of the Pearl River basin is located in areas with abundant rainfall. The West River originates from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the upper reaches have many canyons and rapids, with hydropower resources ten times that of the East River and North River. The Southwest International water system includes the Nu River, Lancang River, Irrawaddy River, Red River, etc. They all flow from the Hengduan Mountains region, from north to south, into Myanmar, Vietnam, and other countries, respectively. These rivers have steep slopes, and the rainfall gradually increases towards the south, so the hydropower resources are particularly abundant. The hydropower resources of the Nu River in the section within China exceed the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo River is the only large river in Tibet. The Great Bend section at the junction of Kang and Tibet is on the slope of the plateau and the plain, with a sharp drop of about 1,900 meters, with hydropower reserves of about 30 million kilowatts, which is a prominent and huge hydropower site in the world. The engineering survey team sent by the State Council to Tibet is currently conducting preliminary reconnaissance of some rivers in Tibet. The southeast coast is hilly and rainy, but the rivers are relatively short. The hydropower resources are the most abundant in the Min River, with more than 3 million kilowatts. The Northeast water system can be roughly divided into two systems, one flowing north, mainly the Songhua River system, and merging into the Heilongjiang River system; the other flowing south or leaning towards the south, mainly the Liao River, Yalu River, and other water systems. The rainfall in the Northeast is more than that in North China, and there is generally snow in winter, and the upper reaches of the rivers have more virgin forests, so the flow changes are not too drastic, and these conditions are also beneficial to hydropower development. The hydropower resource situation in the Northwest inland water system is also the least understood, and reconnaissance work has just begun.

The above overview shows that China's hydropower resources are extremely rich. We must correctly utilize this resource and actively develop this resource to accelerate the development of national economic construction. What deserves our special attention is that whether in terms of comprehensive utilization, geography and topography, investment, the coordination with fuel and thermal power generation, or construction, China's hydropower resource development has extremely favorable conditions.

Many of China's hydropower resources have a huge comprehensive utilization role; the development of these hydropower resources can simultaneously meet the country's current urgent requirements for flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navigation. Therefore, the greatest common interests of the relevant departments of the national economy can be obtained with the most economical investment. When considering the comprehensive utilization significance that certain hydropower stations may have, the superiority of these hydropower stations is often more prominent.

Flood disaster is a problem that has existed in China's vast land since ancient times, and almost all major rivers in the country are threatened by floods to varying degrees in the lower reaches. The flooding disasters of the Yellow River and the Huai River are well known. The flood volume of the Yangtze River accounts for 70 to 80 percent of the annual flow, and the flood season lasts for a long time. There are often periodic floods in the mainstream and major tributaries. Therefore, the primary issue in the comprehensive utilization of many rivers in China and the development of hydropower resources is often how to solve the problem of flood control. The plan for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River pointed out a fundamental key, that is, in a large country like China, on large rivers like the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, to solve such serious flood disasters once and for all, it is necessary to have large reservoirs with huge regulation capacity. To solve the flood and sediment problems of the Yellow River, a Sanmenxia Reservoir with a capacity of 36 billion cubic meters is needed. We can imagine that in the future, to solve the flood control problem of the Yangtze River, of course, it cannot be handled by one or two reservoirs like Sanmenxia. Using large reservoirs to solve the flood control problem is certainly not something that can be done and must be done for every river. This is a very complex issue that relates to the country's economic and technical conditions and the overall planning of national construction. This is one of the major problems that needs to be solved in China's long-term construction. In agriculture, due to the uneven distribution of rainfall in China, it is impossible to guarantee the necessary water volume, and almost all regions in the country are prone to droughts of varying degrees. During the dry season in winter, river navigation is also restricted. With the development of industrial production, the problem of industrial and urban water supply will also become increasingly urgent. Therefore, in addition to hydropower development and flood control, China's rivers also generally have problems of developing irrigation, navigation, and water supply. In this way, although the biggest disadvantage of large reservoirs is that they will cause huge inundation losses, for the comprehensive utilization benefits of rivers, large reservoirs are the most beneficial and can solve various contradictions in a unified manner. China has many excellent hydropower sites that can undertake huge comprehensive utilization tasks. This is the most favorable condition for hydropower resource development in China. Of course, we can also say from another perspective that the urgent flood control requirements of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, etc., also promote and combine with the development of hydropower resources. If we closely integrate the country's industrial deployment with the development of these large rivers, we can also simultaneously meet China's urgent flood control requirements and the requirements for power development, which will accelerate the country's economic construction on the basis of achieving multiple goals with one action.

China's hydropower resources, in terms of their role as a power source, are also very favorable in terms of geographical distribution. In particular, rivers with abundant hydropower are distributed quite evenly in various regions of the country, and almost all industrial areas and densely populated areas are located within the range that can be powered by hydropower stations. Many excellent hydropower sites on the river are very close to industrial cities and mining areas: Sanmenxia on the Yellow River is within 300 to 400 kilometers of cities such as Taiyuan, Luoyang, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou, Liujiaxia is 60 kilometers from Lanzhou and more than 200 kilometers from Xining; the 46 cascades of the Yellow River provide convenient conditions for power consumption in Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hebei provinces; Yuanshui, Hanshui and Zishui (referring to hydropower sites, same below) are all about 400 kilometers from Wuhan; Xin'anjiang is about 350 kilometers from Shanghai; Yongding River and Luan River are within 200 kilometers of Beijing; Longxi River and Jialing River are within 100 kilometers of Chongqing; the upper reaches of Min River are within 100 kilometers of Chengdu; Yi Li River is 50 to 100 kilometers from the mining area of ​​northern Yunnan, and only more than 200 kilometers from Kunming; Shangyou River in southern Jiangxi is 70 kilometers from the mining area of ​​southern Jiangxi; the hydropower sites of Yibin area, Chongqing area and the linking of Dadu River and Mabian River on the main stream of Yangtze River are 100 kilometers to 400 kilometers away from Chengdu, northern Yunnan, Chongqing and Xikang; Songhua River is within 300 to 400 kilometers of the northern and southern industrial areas of Northeast China. The location of the famous Yangtze River Three Gorges is even more suitable. If we measure it with the Soviet Union's current longest transmission distance of 1,000 kilometers, with the Three Gorges as the center, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ya'an, and Beijing are all within this radius. The hydropower resources of the Three Gorges are truly unparalleled in the world. The proper transmission distance is another relatively favorable condition for the development of China's hydropower resources in terms of economy and technology. Many hydropower sites are located in the western part of China and between plateaus, hills and plains, which is also favorable in terms of national defense. In addition, comparing the currently available hydropower resource distribution map and coal resource distribution map, it can be found that there are large amounts of hydropower resources in areas where coal resources are not abundant. The Yangtze River basin and the southwestern region still lack large and high-quality coal mines, but these regions have very rich hydropower resources. For example, many non-ferrous metal mining areas also lack coal deposits, and transportation is very inconvenient; North China and Northwest China have more coalfields, but many large coal mining areas and some cities such as Taiyuan and Datong cannot develop thermal power plants without restrictions due to the limitations of water sources. These areas happen to have excellent hydropower resources that can be utilized.

The terrain and geological conditions of many rivers in China are particularly favorable for the development of hydropower resources. The main reason is that there are more canyon areas, and the head is large and concentrated, and a large amount of power generation can often be obtained with a small amount of engineering. The concentrated head of the rivers in the southwest region is more favorable for diversion-type hydropower stations. For example, the Yunnan Yili River Hydropower Station, which is currently under design, can obtain a head of 1,300 meters with a 10-kilometer tunnel. A tunnel between the Dadu River and Mabian River in Sichuan, only 7 kilometers long, can utilize a natural head of more than 80 meters, and the capacity of the hydropower station will be nearly 2 million kilowatts. The Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian, which is about to generate electricity, has a head of 90 meters with a 2-kilometer tunnel. Large hydropower stations that have been decided to be built and are planned to be built, such as Sanmenxia, ​​Liujiaxia, ​​Xin'anjiang, and the Shangyou Hydropower Station in Jiangxi, which is under construction, are all located in very narrow canyon areas, so the amount of engineering for these hydropower stations is relatively small. The Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations require approximately 2 and 1.2 cubic meters of concrete per kilowatt, and 2.5 and 1.7 cubic meters of earth and stone, respectively. The Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations in the Soviet Union require approximately 3.8 and 3.6 cubic meters of concrete per kilowatt, and 74.3 and 62.2 cubic meters of earth and stone, respectively. The average amount of engineering for the 46 cascades of the Yellow River is very small, requiring approximately 1.7 cubic meters of concrete per kilowatt and 4 cubic meters of earth and stone; the number of cubic meters of concrete required per kilowatt for major hydropower stations is only about half of that of major hydropower stations in various countries in the world.

Among the investment in the construction of hydropower stations, the proportion of civil engineering construction is larger, generally accounting for about two-thirds of the total project investment (excluding the investment in reservoir inundation losses), and the investment in mechanical and electrical equipment only accounts for one-third (for thermal power stations, mechanical and electrical equipment accounts for two-thirds, and civil construction accounts for one-third). The relative price of civil engineering construction in China (compared with mechanical and electrical equipment and metal materials) is very low; according to the conversion, it is several times lower than the relative unit price in the Soviet Union, which is closely related to China's large population and inexhaustible labor force.

The superiority of natural conditions and the low unit price of civil construction make the investment conditions for building hydropower stations in China very favorable. According to current materials, the unit cost of medium-sized hydropower stations with a capacity of about 50,000 kilowatts is only about half more expensive than that of thermal power stations of the same capacity, and individual ones are equal; the cost of large hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia is even cheaper than that of thermal power stations. The cost of hydropower stations in the Soviet Union is generally three to four times more expensive than that of thermal power stations, but the cost of hydropower stations currently being built on the Angara River in Siberia is also lower than that of thermal power stations.

The construction speed of water conservancy projects and hydropower station projects that have been completed and are under construction in China is very fast. The construction speed of hydropower stations in the Soviet Union is stipulated as five years for large hydropower stations and three years for medium-sized hydropower stations. We can completely achieve this speed. The time from the start of construction to power generation, for example, the Guanting Hydropower Station will be one and a half years, and the Shizitan Hydropower Station will be two and a half years. This is partly due to the relatively small amount of engineering, good climatic conditions, and most areas can be constructed all year round, and also due to the following series of reasons: the construction preparation process, such as employee housing and living welfare facilities, can be simplified as much as possible; although the level of mechanized construction is not high, the strong labor force can make up for the lack of mechanization; the hard-working spirit, political awareness, and continuous improvement of organization of the Chinese people often play a decisive role in the growth of labor productivity and ensuring project progress. If the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station can generate electricity within five years, this speed will definitely not be slower than building a thermal power station of the same capacity.

In addition, since the manufacturing conditions of hydro-turbine generators are not as complex as steam turbine generators, China can manufacture hydro-turbine generators of more than 10,000 kilowatts in the first five-year plan period, and can manufacture hydro-turbine generators of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts or even larger in the second five-year plan period. Therefore, actively building hydropower stations can rapidly promote the development of China's motor manufacturing industry, which is also beneficial in terms of saving foreign exchange.

There are also some unfavorable conditions for building hydropower stations in China, such as the large difference between flood and dry season flows, extremely unfavorable geological conditions in some areas (such as the karst areas of limestone in Yunnan), especially the difficulties brought about by huge reservoir inundation losses, and the particularly serious sediment problem in many rivers, but most of these unfavorable conditions can be overcome. For the construction of hydropower stations, these unfavorable conditions cannot fundamentally affect the positive role of the above-mentioned favorable conditions.

In the spring of 1955, when the Electric Power Delegation to the Soviet Union of the former Ministry of Fuel Industry visited the Soviet Union to visit power station construction, Academician Ventzel (the person in charge of the construction of the Dnieper Hydropower Station), a pioneer in Soviet hydropower construction, told us the following: The Soviet Union recognized in the early days that the cheapest electricity is hydropower. In the Soviet Union, the power generation of hydropower stations is best equivalent to half of the country's power generation, and of course the larger the better, which can ensure sufficient power consumption for the national economy. Over the past 30 years, the Soviet Union's power generation has increased more than 300 times. When the Soviet Union formulated the All-Russia Electrification Plan in 1920, the technical level was low and the economy was backward, and China today can fully utilize the Soviet Union's latest equipment and all achievements. Therefore, China can completely realize the speed of Soviet power development. This passage is worthy of our deep understanding.

According to the above-mentioned superior conditions of China's hydropower resources and hydropower development, according to the needs of China's entire national economic development, and according to the requirements of water conservancy, especially flood control, even without considering the needs of the atomic energy industry, China can and must develop hydropower on a large scale and rapidly. Giving priority to building hydropower stations and building large-capacity hydropower stations as much as possible has become one of the main policies of the Soviet Union's post-war development of the power industry. Following Kuibyshev and Stalingrad, the world's largest hydropower stations, the Soviet Union will build hydropower stations with a capacity of 3 million kilowatts to 5 million kilowatts on the Siberian rivers during the sixth five-year plan period. The Bratsk Hydropower Station on the Angara River, with a capacity of more than 3 million kilowatts, has already started construction. The experience of the Soviet Union's power industry construction and national economic development over the past 38 years shows that as long as the conditions are suitable, large hydropower stations should be built as much as possible to solve the major problems of the national economy; at the same time, it is also beneficial in terms of investment and the use of engineering technology forces. Therefore, according to the experience of the Soviet Union and according to China's specific conditions, giving priority to building hydropower stations and building large hydropower stations as much as possible is also completely reasonable and necessary in China. We are fully capable of catching up in this regard; this should not only become one of the main policies for the development of China's power industry, but also an important aspect of China's entire socialist industrialization and agricultural socialist transformation.

    中国的水力资源和建设水电站的优越条件
    电力工业部部长助理　李锐
    中国是世界上水力资源最丰富的国家之一。这是由于我国领土广大，雨量充沛，地势西高东低，许多巨大河流穿行于占全国三分之二面积的高原、山脉和丘陵之间所造成的。同时，我国水力资源开发——建设水电站的技术经济条件非常优越，在某些方面是许多国家所不及的。毫无疑问，优越的水力资源和它的开发，对我国的社会主义建设，对工业、农业、交通运输等方面的发展，将日益起着积极的重大的作用。
    中国的水力资源究竟有多少呢？过去大家常援用的数字是一亿五千万瓩。这个数字是全国解放以前的一个估算，当时材料有限，显然偏低。为了适应我国经济建设事业的发展，一九五五年以来，电力工业部所属水力发电勘测设计部门根据现在掌握到的各种资料，对全国的水力资源重新作了一个极粗略的估算。这次估算的范围包括全国较大的河流共一千五百九十八条，流域总面积约占全国总面积百分之七十强；河道总长度约二十二万六千多公里，年总水量约为二万六千八百亿立方公尺（即二千六百八十立方公里）。根据这个范围内的估算，我国水力资源理论上的总蕴藏量，按河流的平均流量计算约为五亿四千万瓩。利用系数如以百分之五十至百分之六十计算（考虑到实际开发中落差和流量都不可避免地要损失一部分；苏联水电设计院曾采用这个系数），则我国可能利用的水力资源，按平均流量计算，约为三亿瓩上下。由于资料的不足，这一估算只能说明一个轮廓或趋势；有关数据还待今后长期工作中积累的资料加以修正。
    这个五亿四千万瓩的理论水力蕴藏量，在全国各水系的分布情况大体是这样的：长江水系占百分之四十，西藏水系占百分之二十一点五，西南国际水系占百分之十六点七，黄河水系占百分之六，珠江水系占百分之五点二，东南沿海水系（包括台湾和海南岛）占百分之三点八，甘青新内陆水系占百分之三点二，东北水系占百分之三点三，华北海河、滦河水系占百分之○点三。因此在地区的分布上，我国水力资源的百分之七十二集中在西南地区；华北和内蒙古地区最少，不及百分之二。
    我国的水力资源按照各河系来说，以长江为最大。长江是中国最大的河流，流域面积一百九十四万平方公里（包括长江入海的部分淮河流域），河口平均流量三万二千五百秒公方，年总水量超过一万亿立方公尺。长江干流的总落差有五千公尺。它的主要支流岷江、嘉陵江、乌江、沅水、资水、汉水等，都有巨大的水力资源。从流量说，长江居世界大河流中的第四位；从水力蕴藏量说，长江居世界大河流中的第三位，比各资本主义国家已公布的水力资源都大得多：如美国为八千五百万瓩，加拿大为五千七百万瓩，挪威为二千万瓩，法国为八百九十万瓩，意大利为六百万瓩。黄河干流自龙羊峡至海口段的水力资源，已经按综合利用原则分为四十六个梯级开发。落差利用率达百分之八十三。黄河将来的问题是水量太小了。长江许多支流的水量都比黄河大得多。因此总有一天，黄河要向长江借水用的。淮河流域所通过的大部是平原地区，中游支流自南北两方扇形汇集，因而容易造成洪水壅阻，水力资源则不足一百万瓩。珠江流域大部处于雨量丰富地区。西江源出云贵高原，上游段多峡谷急滩，水力资源等于东江和北江的十倍。西南国际水系包括怒江、澜沧江、伊洛瓦底江、红河等，它们都从横断山脉区域，由北而南，分别流入缅甸、越南等国。这些河流坡度陡急，愈向南趋，雨量也渐大，所以水力资源特别丰富。怒江在我国境内一段的水力资源即超过黄河。雅鲁藏布江为西藏的唯一大河。康藏交界处的大河湾段正在高原和平原的坡面上，落差急骤跌落，约一千九百公尺上下，蕴藏水力在三千万瓩左右，实为世界上突出的巨大水力地址。现在国务院派在西藏的工程勘查队正在初步进行西藏部分河流的踏勘工作。东南沿海丘陵重叠，雨量丰沛，但河流比较短促。水力资源以闽江最丰富，在三百万瓩以上。东北水系大体可分为两个系统，一是向北流的，以松花江水系为主，并入黑龙江水系；一是向南或偏向南流的，主要有辽河、鸭绿江等水系。东北雨量比华北多，冬季一般积雪，河流上游又多原始森林，所以流量变化不太剧烈，这些条件对水力开发也是有利的。西北内陆水系的水力资源情况也是最少了解的，刚开始进行查勘工作。
    以上概述说明，我国的水力资源极其丰富，我们必须正确利用这一资源，积极开发这一资源，以加速国家经济建设的发展。值得我们特别重视的是，不论是综合利用方面，地理、地形方面，投资方面，同燃料和火力发电的配合方面，以及施工方面，我国水力资源的开发无不具备极其优越的条件。
    我国许多水力资源都具有巨大的综合利用的作用；这些水力资源的开发，都能同时满足国家当前迫切的防洪、发电、灌溉和航运等等要求。因此，就可以最经济的投资取得国民经济各有关部门最大的共同利益。在考虑到某些水电站所可能具有的综合利用的意义的时候，这些水电站的优越性往往就更为突出。
    洪水灾害是我国广大土地上自古以来存在的问题，几乎全国所有主要河流的下游无不有程度不同的洪水威胁。黄河和淮河的泛滥灾害是大家所熟知的。长江的洪水量占年流量的百分之七十到八十，汛期持续的时间很长，干流和主要支流常有周期性的水灾。因此我国许多河流的综合利用和水力资源的开发，首要的问题往往是如何解决防洪的问题。黄河综合利用的规划中指明了一个根本的关键，这就是在中国这样的大国，在黄河、长江这些大河流上，要一劳永逸地解决如此严重的洪水灾害问题，是必须有巨大调节能力的大水库的。解决黄河的洪水和泥沙问题，需要有容积达三百六十亿公方的三门峡水库，我们可以设想，将来要解决长江的防洪问题，当然就不是一个或两个像三门峡这样的水库所能胜任的了。采用大水库的办法来解决防洪问题，当然不是每一条河流都能办到的和都必须这样办的，这是一个非常复杂的问题，关系到国家的经济、技术条件和国家建设的全面规划，这是我国长远建设中需要解决的大问题之一。在农业上，由于我国雨量分布不均匀不能保证必要的水量，几乎全国各个地区都容易发生程度不同的旱灾。冬季枯水时期，河流的航运也受到限制。随着工业生产的发展，工业和城市供水的问题也将日益迫切。因此除开水力开发和防洪之外，我国的河流还普遍有发展灌溉、航运和供水等问题。这样，虽然大水库最大的不利是将造成巨大的淹没损失，但是对于河流的综合利用效益来说，大水库是最有利的，最能统一解决各项矛盾。我国有许多优良的水力地址，都能胜任巨大的综合利用的任务，这是我国水力资源开发上最有利的一个条件。当然我们也可以从另一方面来说，黄河、长江等迫切的防洪要求，也推动和结合了水力资源的开发。如果我们将国家的工业部署同这些大河流的开发密切结合起来，也就能同时满足我国迫切的防洪要求和电力发展的要求，这就将在一举数得的基础上，加速推进国家的经济建设。
    我国的水力资源，就其作为电源的作用而言，在地理的分布上也是十分有利的。特别是水力丰富的河流相当均匀地分布在全国各个地区，几乎全部工业区域和人口稠密区域都位于可能由水电站供电的范围之内。许多河流上优良的水力地址，距离工业城市和矿区都是很近的：黄河的三门峡距太原、洛阳、西安、郑州等城市都在三、四百公里以内，刘家峡距兰州六十公里、西宁二百多公里；黄河的四十六个梯级对于青海、甘肃、内蒙古、山西、陕西、河南、河北各省区的用电，提供了便利的条件；沅水、汉水和资水（指水力地址，下同）距武汉也都在四百公里左右；新安江距上海约三百五十公里；永定河和滦河距北京在二百公里以内；龙溪河和嘉陵江距重庆在一百公里内；岷江上游距成都在一百公里内；以礼河距滇北矿区为五十至一百公里，距昆明也只二百多公里；赣南上犹水距赣南矿区七十公里；长江干流宜宾区、重庆区以及大渡河、马边河联结的水力地址，距离成都、滇北、重庆、西康在一百公里至四百公里左右；松花江距东北的北部和南部工业区都在三、四百公里。著名的长江三峡的地位更为适中，如果以苏联目前最远输电距离一千公里来衡量，以三峡为中心，则上海、广州、雅安、北京都在这个半径之内。三峡的水力资源，实在是世无匹敌的。输电距离的适当，是开发我国水力资源在经济上和技术上另一个比较有利的条件。许多水力地址位于我国西部以及高原、丘陵和平原之间，在国防上也是有利的。此外，对照现在已经掌握的水力资源分布图和煤炭资源分布图，可以发现在煤炭资源不丰富的地区，恰恰有大量的水力资源。长江流域和西南地区，至今还缺少量大质佳的煤矿，但是这些地区的水力资源都是十分丰富的。又如许多有色金属矿区附近，也缺乏煤藏，交通又十分不便；华北、西北煤田较多，可是许多大的煤矿区和一部分城市如太原、大同等，由于水源的限制，不能无限制地发展火电站，这些地区正好都有优良的水力资源可以利用。
    我国许多河流的地形、地质条件对水力资源开发是特别有利的，主要是峡谷地区较多，落差大而集中，往往可以用较小的工程量得到很大的发电量。西南地区的河流落差集中，对引水道式水电站更为有利。例如目前正在设计中的云南以礼河水电站，十公里隧道共可得落差一千三百公尺。四川大渡河、马边河两河间开一隧道，长不过七公里，可利用的天然落差达八十多公尺，水电站的容量将近二百万瓩。即将发电的福建古田水电站，开二公里隧道，得落差九十公尺。已经决定修建和计划修建的大水电站，如三门峡、刘家峡、新安江，以及正在修建的江西上犹水电站等，都位于很窄的峡谷地区，因此这些水电站的工程量都比较小。三门峡和刘家峡水电站每瓩容量约需混凝土各为二和一·二公方，土石方各为二·五和一·七公方。苏联古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站每瓩容量约需混凝土各为三·八和三·六公方，土石方各为七四·三和六二·二公方。黄河四十六个梯级的平均工程量是很小的，每瓩容量约需混凝土一·七公方，土石方四公方；其中各大水电站每瓩容量所需混凝土方数同世界各国大水电站相比较，只及一半左右。
    建设水电站的投资中，土木建筑工程所占的比重较大，一般约占工程总投资（水库淹没损失投资在外）的三分之二，机电投资只占三分之一（火电站的投资，机电占三分之二，土建占三分之一）。我国土木建筑工程的相对价格（同机电设备和金属材料相比），是十分低廉的；根据换算，比苏联的相对单价要低好几成，这同我国人口众多、劳动力的取之不竭有密切的关系。
    自然条件的优越和土建工程单价的低廉，就使得我国修建水电站的投资条件十分有利。根据现在的材料，一般容量五万瓩左右的中型水电站的单位造价只比同容量的火电站的造价贵半倍左右，个别的相等；三门峡、刘家峡等大水电站的造价，则比火电站的造价还要便宜。苏联水电站的造价一般比火电站要贵三、四倍不等，但是目前在西伯利亚安加拉河上修建的水电站，造价也比火电站要低。
    我国已经建成和正在建设的水利工程和水电站工程的建设速度是很快的。苏联水电站建设的速度规定为大水电站五年，中型水电站三年。这样的速度我们是完全可以达到的。从开工到发电的时间，例如官厅水电站将是一年半，狮子滩水电站将是两年半。这一方面是由于工程量相对地比较少，气候条件好，绝大部分地区可以一年四季施工，同时还由于以下一系列的原因：施工准备过程如职工的住宅和生活福利设备等可以尽量简化；机械化施工水平虽然不高，但是强大的劳动力可以补足机械化的不够；我国人民的刻苦耐劳精神，政治觉悟和组织性的不断提高，对于劳动生产率的增长和保证工程进度，常常起着决定的作用。如果说三门峡水电站五年之内可以发电，这种速度就决不比建造同容量的火电站慢了。
    此外，由于水轮发电机的制造条件不如蒸气透平发电机复杂，我国在第一个五年计划时期就可以制造每台一万瓩以上的水轮发电机，第二个五年计划时期就可以制造每台五万至十万瓩甚至更大的水轮发电机，因而积极建设水电站可以迅速地促进我国电机制造工业的发展，在节省外汇方面也是有利的。
    我国修建水电站也有一些不利的条件，如洪水和枯水流量相差悬殊，某些地区地质条件极其不利（如云南的石灰岩喀斯特地区多），特别是水库淹没损失巨大所带来的困难，以及不少河流的泥沙问题特殊严重等，但是这些不利条件大都是可以克服的。对于建设水电站，这些不利的条件，不可能根本影响上述有利条件的积极作用。
    一九五五年春天，前燃料工业部的电业访苏团在苏联参观访问电站建设的时候，苏联水电建设的前辈文帖尔院士（建设德聂泊水电站的负责人）曾同我们谈过下面一段话：苏联在最初时期就认识到最便宜的电力是水电。苏联的情况，水电站发电量最好相当于全国发电量的一半，当然越大越好，可以保证国民经济充分用电。三十多年来，苏联的发电量增长了三百多倍。苏联在一九二○年制定全俄电气化计划的时候，技术水平低，经济落后，而中国今天可以充分利用苏联最新的设备和一切成就。因此，苏联电力发展的速度，中国完全能够实现。这一段话是值得我们深加体会的。
    根据上述我国水力资源和水力开发的优越条件，根据我国整个国民经济发展的需要，根据有关水利事业首先是防洪的要求，即令不计原子能工业发展的需要，我国完全可能也完全必要大规模地、迅速地发展水电事业。尽先修建水电站，尽可能修建大容量的水电站，已经成为苏联战后发展电力工业的主要政策之一。继古比雪夫和斯大林格勒这些世界上最巨大的水电站之后，苏联在第六个五年计划时期内，将在西伯利亚河流上修建容量三百万瓩至五百万瓩的水电站，现在位于安加拉河上的容量在三百万瓩以上的布拉次克水电站已经开工了。苏联三十八年来电力工业建设和国民经济发展的经验，说明只要条件合宜，应当尽量建造大水电站，以解决国民经济的大问题；同时在投资和工程技术力量的使用方面，这样也是有利的。因此，根据苏联的经验，根据我国的具体情况，尽先修建水电站，尽可能修建大水电站，在我国也是完全合理的和必要的，这方面我们完全有条件迎头赶上去；这不仅应成为我国发展电力工业的主要政策之一，而且也是我国整个社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的一个重要方面。
