Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 16th: The Japanese Socialist Party submitted a motion of no confidence against Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu to the House of Representatives Secretariat on the afternoon of December 15th.

The Socialist Party explained the reasons for its no confidence in Shigemitsu in the motion. The first of these is that Shigemitsu's opinions on important diplomatic issues differ from those of Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, and he has repeatedly failed in foreign negotiations. This not only clearly hinders Japan's interests, but also, in relations with the United States, violates the election promise to adopt an independent and autonomous diplomatic policy, and consistently pursues a foreign policy that follows the United States.

The Socialist Party's motion also pointed out that in the Japan-Soviet negotiations, Shigemitsu's policy of demanding a solution to outstanding issues first has brought the negotiations to a standstill.

In addition, regarding Japan's relations with China, Shigemitsu stubbornly maintains relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, delaying the development of trade and the restoration of peaceful relations with China.

The Socialist Party's motion also pointed out Shigemitsu's diplomatic failures regarding Japan's admission to the United Nations and other issues.

Because Japan has failed to join the United Nations, opposition party members in Japan have been questioning the government's foreign policy in the Diet. At a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Labor-Farmer Party member Haruo Okada pointed out that Japan's failure to join the United Nations is ultimately due to Shigemitsu's one-sided pro-American diplomacy. Socialist Party member Toshiko Tobaya demanded in her questioning that Shigemitsu reach an agreement as soon as possible in the negotiations to normalize Soviet-Japanese relations. At a plenary session of the House of Councillors, Socialist Party member Mishichi Habu pointed out that the Japanese government's policy of blindly relying on the United States cannot enable Japan to develop. He asked, is it not time for the Japanese government to revise its diplomatic policy towards China?

According to Kyodo News, the fact that Japan failed to join the United Nations has also "caused great dissatisfaction" within the Liberal Democratic Party.

### 日本社会党对外务相重光提出不信任案

    日本社会党对外务相重光提出不信任案
    据新华社十六日讯  东京消息：日本社会党在十二月十五日下午向众议院事务局提出了不信任外务相重光葵的决议案。
    社会党在决议案中说明了它不信任重光的理由。其中首先是：重光在重要的外交问题的方针上和首相鸠山一郎的意见分歧，在对外谈判方面一再失败，不仅明显地妨害了日本的利益，而且在对美国关系方面，违背了采取独立自主的外交方针的竞选诺言，始终是在推行着追随美国的外交。
    社会党的决议案又指出，在日苏谈判中，重光要求首先解决悬而未决问题的方针使得谈判陷入僵局。
    此外，在日本同中国的关系方面，由于重光固执地维持同蒋介石集团的关系，拖延了同中国发展贸易和恢复和平关系。
    社会党的决议案也指出了重光的外交在日本加入联合国问题上和在其他问题上的失败。
    由于日本未能加入联合国，日本在野党议员已经在国会里纷纷对政府的外交政策提出质询。在众议院外务委员会会议上，劳农党议员冈田春夫指出，日本未能加入联合国，归根结底说来，重光采取的向美国一边倒的外交是有责任的。社会党议员户叶里子在质询中要求重光使苏日关系正常化的谈判早日达成协议。在参议院的全体会议上，社会党议员羽生三七指出，日本政府的一味依靠美国的外交方针不能使日本获得发展。他说，现在不是日本政府修改对中国的外交方针的时候了吗？
    据共同社报道，日本未能加入联合国一事，在自由民主党内部也“引起了很大的不满”。
