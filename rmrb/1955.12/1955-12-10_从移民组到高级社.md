From Immigration Group to Advanced Cooperative
    Wu Erxiang
    The Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Waisha Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, which was only recently established, was transformed from a "People's Collective Group." The members of this group were all farmers who had moved from Heshan County. Why was this group called the "People's Collective Group," and how did it become an advanced cooperative? Here is a story.
    In the autumn of 1953, Xu Xinhang, chairman of the Fourth Village Farmers' Association in Baishuidai Township, Heshan County, received a letter from a friend in Waisha Township, Zhongshan County, saying that Waisha Township, Zhongshan County, faced the Pearl River, backed by mountains, and had a plain within its borders, fertile land, and crisscrossing rivers. It was not dry all year round, and it was possible to plant trees and raise livestock in the mountains, and plant hemp and tobacco. One could also fish in the water. However, there were few people and a lot of land, and no one was cultivating the fertile land. There was great potential for development if people could be relocated to reclaim the land. Xu Xinhang lived in a mountainous area with a large population and little land, with an average of only two hundred catties of grain per person, making life difficult. He was very happy to read his friend's letter and immediately told many farmers in his township about it. However, they did not quite believe that there was such a good place, so they decided that Xu Xinhang and three other farmers should go to Waisha Township, Zhongshan County, to observe first. When they arrived in Waisha Township, what they saw was the same as what their friend had written in the letter. After they came back, they contacted twelve farming households and decided that one person from each household would go first. After the autumn harvest, the twelve people completed the immigration procedures, each carrying a hoe, a sickle, and some living expenses, and came to Waisha Township, Zhongshan County. Standing on the hillside north of Waisha Township, they looked up and saw a large expanse of fertile fields extending from their feet, connected to the mirror-like Pearl River in front. They decided to build their homes on this hillside.
    At the beginning it was difficult. Twelve people lived in a small thatched house. But they were all young men, and they were all poor farmers, and good hope inspired them. Xu Xinhang said to everyone: "The current difficulties are temporary, and the difficulties can be overcome by relying on our collective strength." They slept together, ate together, and worked together. The reclaimed land was for everyone, and the vegetables grown and the pigs raised were also for everyone. Because everything was collective, they gave themselves the name "People's Collective Group." Xu Xinhang was elected as the leader of the collective group, and an accountant and cashier were also elected. In this group, regardless of the strength of labor or the difficulty of labor, whoever did a day's work was recorded as a day's work, and the same was true for those who were sick. Because they did not know who would get sick in the future, in order to prevent people who were sick from having financial difficulties, they made an agreement before coming to Waisha Township: whoever is sick and does not work will also be recorded as a day's work. They also stipulated that at harvest time, the distribution would be based on the number of labor days each person worked, with no land compensation, because the land was reclaimed by everyone's joint labor. They had no concerns about private property, and worked wholeheartedly and enthusiastically, striving to work more and get more labor days. Lai Ying, who was weak in labor, also did more than 230 labor days in 1954. When they had problems with farming techniques, they learned from local farmers. If they did not have cattle, they rented them. The local government also helped them solve the problems of rations, seeds, and other issues.
    In the autumn of 1954—the first autumn after they came to Waisha Township—the 70 mu of wasteland they had opened up with their own hands yielded more than 23,000 catties of rice and 1,200 catties of peanuts; in addition, they raised 270 ducks and four large pigs. This year, they not only did not require the state to supply rations, but also sold more than 10,000 catties of surplus grain to the state for the first time. Before and after the autumn harvest, they also used the spare time during the slack season to build nine houses with mud walls and tile roofs. With places to live, their families also moved in one after another. Then, more than 30 farming households moved in. Now this barren hillside has become a new village with more than 50 households.
    By 1955, due to the increase in the number of households and people, the original "People's Collective Group" composed of twelve households and twelve laborers had expanded to nineteen households with thirty-two laborers. Their cultivated area had expanded from the original 70 mu to 218 mu. When they first came, each person only had a hoe and a sickle. Now they have bought an ox, three boats, a waterwheel, a windmill, three plows, twenty-two sacks, and some other scattered farm tools. These are all the public property of the group.
    They summed up the production of the past year and believed that in order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of the group members for labor, the first thing to do was to improve the method of calculating labor days. They learned from the experience of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Waisha Township, re-evaluated the basic labor points of each group member according to their labor strength, and conducted a dynamic evaluation. At the same time, they also tried a piece-rate system for these farm tasks. They divided the thirty-two laborers into two production teams, each with a team leader and a scorekeeper. They learned to do what the agricultural production cooperative did. In the past, everyone ate from the same pot, but now that the families have come, they live separately and eat separately. They also left each group member a piece of open space to grow vegetables and sweet potatoes themselves. Raising chickens and ducks was also separated.
    In the past two years, they have deeply experienced that everything is created by labor, and their enthusiasm for production is generally very high. They changed 156 mu of paddy fields from intercropping to continuous cropping. Each laborer is responsible for the labor of about five mu of double-cropping rice. This is rare in the sandy field area. This year, their early rice harvest was more than 49,000 catties of rice, and they sold more than 23,000 catties of surplus grain, over fulfilling the task of selling surplus grain. The Waisha Township People's Committee awarded them a red flag for this. Now it is the season for harvesting late rice, and it is estimated that the late rice can harvest 60,000 catties of rice, with an average income of more than 5,000 catties of rice per household, in addition to sideline income. Their lives have begun to improve.
    In October, Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of cooperativization were transmitted to Waisha Township, and the members of the "People's Collective Group" joyfully welcomed the cadres who were establishing the cooperative. Group leader Xu Xinhang said: "If we want to be well-fed and well-clothed, we must take the socialist road." Now they are no longer the "People's Collective Group" of nineteen households, but have developed into the Sixth Agricultural Production Cooperative of Waisha Township with thirty-six households. What distinguishes their cooperative from other cooperatives is that from the very beginning it was an advanced agricultural production cooperative that completely "compensated labor according to work."

    从移民组到高级社
    吴尔祥
    广东省中山县外沙乡不久以前才建立起来的第六农业生产合作社，是由一个“人民集体组”转上去的。这个组的成员都是由鹤山县迁过来的农民。这个组为什么叫做“人民集体组”，又怎样变成高级社的呢？这里有一段故事。
    一九五三年秋天，鹤山县白水带乡四村农会主席徐信行，接到他在中山县的一个朋友的一封信，说中山县外沙乡，面临珠江，背靠山，境内一片平原，土地肥沃，河流纵横，终年不旱，山上可以造林、牧畜，种麻、种烟，水里可以捕鱼。但是这里人少地多，成片肥美土地，没有人去耕种，如果能够移民开荒，大有发展前途。徐信行住的这个地方是个山区，人多地少，每人平均只有二百斤粮食产量的地，生活困难。他读着朋友的信，高兴得很，马上就把这个情况告诉了本乡的许多农民。但是他们不大相信真有那么好的地方，因此决定由徐信行和另外三个农民先去中山县外沙乡，作一番观察。到了外沙乡，他们所看到的和那个朋友信里写的一样。他们回来以后，就串连了十二户农民，决定每一户先去一个人。秋收过后，十二个人办好了移民手续，每人随身带了一个锄头、一把镰刀和一些生活费，来到了中山县外沙乡。他们站在外沙乡北面的山坡上，举目望去，一大片肥美的田地，从他们的脚下伸延开去，和前面横流过的像镜子一样的珠江水流相接。他们就决定在这山坡上建设自己的家园。
    开始是困难的。十二个人住在一间小茅草房里。但是他们都是年青的小伙子，并且都是贫苦农民，美好的希望鼓舞着他们。徐信行对大家说：“现在的困难是暂时的，依靠我们集体的力量，困难是可以克服的。”他们睡在一起，吃在一起，劳动在一起。开的荒地是大家的，种的菜、养的猪也是大家的。因为样样都是集体的，他们就给自己起了个“人民集体组”的名字。徐信行被大家选做集体组的组长，还选出了会计和出纳。在这个组里，不分劳动力的强弱和劳动的轻重，谁做了一个工就记下一个工，谁病了也一样记工。因为他们谁也不知道将来谁会病，为了使生病的人不至于发生生活困难，他们在没有来外沙乡之前就订了一条公约：谁病了不出勤也记工。他们还规定：到收获的时候，就按每人做的劳动日多少进行分配，没有土地报酬，因为土地是大家共同劳动开垦的。他们没有什么私有财产的牵挂，都一心一意地、热情地劳动，争取多出工，多得劳动日。劳动力弱的赖英，一九五四年一年也做了二百三十多个工。他们在耕作技术方面有了问题，就向当地农民学习。没有耕牛，就去租用。当地政府又协助他们解决了口粮、种籽等问题。
    一九五四年秋天——他们来外沙乡后第一年的秋天，他们凭双手开出来的七十亩荒地，收了二万三千多斤稻谷和一千二百斤花生；另外还喂养了二百七十只鸭子和四条大猪。这一年，他们不仅没有要国家供应口粮，而且第一次卖了一万多斤余粮给国家。在秋收前后，他们还利用农闲空隙，建造了九间土墙瓦顶的房子。有了住的地方，他们的家属也陆续搬来了。接着，又迁来了三十多户农民。现在这个荒凉的山坡，已经变成一个住有五十多户人家的新村了。
    到一九五五年，由于户数多了，人多了，原来由十二户十二个劳动力组成的“人民集体组”，扩大到了十九户，三十二个劳动力。他们的耕地面积已由原来的七十亩扩大到二百一十八亩。他们初来的时候，每人只有一个锄头和一把镰刀。现在他们买了一头耕牛，三只艇，一架水车，一个风车，三张犁耙，二十二只麻包，和其他一些零星农具。这些都是组里的公共财产。
    他们总结了过去一年的生产，认为要进一步发挥组员的劳动热情，首先要改进劳动日的计算方法。他们学习外沙乡第一农业生产合作社的经验，按劳动力的强弱，重新评定了每个组员的劳动底分，进行活评，同时对这些农活还试行了按件计工制。他们把三十二个劳动力分成了两个生产队，每个队有队长，有记分员。农业生产合作社怎么做，他们也就学着怎么做。过去吃大锅饭，现在家属来了，住分开了，吃也分开了。还留给每个组员一块空地，自己种菜、种甘薯。养鸡、养鸭也分开了。
    两年来，他们深深体验到，一切都是劳动创造出来的，他们的生产积极性一般都很高。他们把一百五十六亩水稻由间作改为连作。每个劳动力负担五亩左右双季水稻的劳作。这在沙田地区是少有的事。今年，他们的早稻收了四万九千多斤稻谷，卖了二万三千斤余粮，超额完成了卖余粮的任务。外沙乡人民委员会为此奖给他们一面红旗。现在又到晚稻收割的季节，估计晚稻可收六万斤稻谷，每户平均收入五千多斤稻谷，另外还有副业收入。他们的生活已开始好转了。
    十月间，毛主席关于合作化问题的指示传达到了外沙乡，“人民集体组”的组员欢欣鼓舞地迎接了办社的干部。组长徐信行说：“我们要丰衣足食，就得走社会主义的道路。”现在他们已不再是十九户的“人民集体组”了，已发展成为三十六户的外沙乡第六农业生产合作社。他们这个社和别的社不同的，一开始就是完全“按劳取酬”的高级农业生产合作社。
