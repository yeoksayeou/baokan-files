Xinhua News Agency, Asansol, December 8th. Bulganin and Khrushchev returned to India from Burma on the afternoon of December 7th. Their plane left Rangoon, crossed the Bay of Bengal and the densely forested delta formed by the great rivers of India, passed over Calcutta, and carried the distinguished guests to Asansol, the industrial heart of the new India and the center of the Damodar Valley.

Bulganin and Khrushchev received a grand welcome in Asansol. Minister of Industry Kanungo, representing the Indian government, and senior officials of the state headed by West Bengal Chief Minister Roy, were at the airport to greet them. The roads leading to the airport were packed with tens of thousands of residents of the Damodar Valley, who warmly welcomed the Soviet guests.

Bulganin and Khrushchev traveled by car from the airport to Chittaranjan, the location of the country's largest locomotive factory. Nearby is the Maithon Dam on the Barakar River, the largest dam currently being built in the Damodar Valley.
