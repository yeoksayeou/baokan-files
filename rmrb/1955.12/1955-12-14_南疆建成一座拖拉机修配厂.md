    The first modern tractor repair and assembly plant in southern Xinjiang has been established in the Aksu oasis. The entire building of this plant is of reinforced concrete structure, divided into sixteen workshops, equipped with automated traveling crane tracks and crane tracks, the ground is paved with light railway tracks, and there are ventilation, heating and water supply and drainage equipment. The machines in this factory are all manufactured in the Soviet Union and China.
    After the plant is put into production, it will be able to repair and assemble tractors, combine harvesters and other agricultural machinery and tools for cultivating 300,000 to 350,000 mu of land per year. At that time, tractors needing repair in the nearby areas would no longer need to be sent to Urumqi, thousands of kilometers away.
    Currently, an engineering unit of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, which is responsible for building the plant, is working intensely on machine installation.

    南疆建成一座拖拉机修配厂
    新疆南部地区第一个现代化拖拉机修配厂，已在阿克苏绿州诞生。这个厂的整个建筑为钢筋水泥混合结构，共分十六个车间，装有自动化的行车轨道和吊车轨道，地面铺有轻便铁轨，还有通风暖气和上下水道的设备。这个厂的机器都是苏联和我国制造的。
    这个厂投入生产后，一年能修配可耕三十至三十五万亩土地的拖拉机、联合收割机等农业机器和农具。那时，附近地区需要修理的拖拉机，就不用再送到数千公里以外的乌鲁木齐市了。
    目前，负责修建这个厂的新疆军区生产建设兵团某工程部队，正紧张地进行机器安装工作。
