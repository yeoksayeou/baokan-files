Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 25th: Twenty-nine women's groups in Bombay held a banquet on the evening of December 24th to welcome Soong Ching Ling.

Soong Ching Ling delivered a speech at the banquet. She said, "Chinese and Indian women have suffered long-term oppression from feudalism and colonialism. Our two countries have finally gained independence. They are now working together to rebuild their respective countries and maintain peace in Asia and the the world. This explains why the women of our two countries must strengthen our solidarity, especially based on the Five Principles, or Panchsheel. In this way, the 500 million women of China and India will play their due role in international affairs."

She also said: "In the future, if we continue to work in this direction, uniting women of all classes, political views, religious beliefs, and professions, to rebuild our country, to strive for peace, and to strive for support for the great Five Principles, then, may I ask, who would dare to despise the voice of the 500 million women of China and India? Who would dare to ignore this great strength of the billion people of China and India?"

Soong Ching Ling concluded by wishing that the solidarity of the women of China and India would continue to expand and strengthen. The entire audience welcomed her speech with warm applause.

Mrs. Kapila Khandvala, the Bombay Municipal Government Education Officer who presided over the banquet, said that China and India have become important forces in the world. Their leading role at the Bandung Conference has shown that colonialism throughout Asia and Africa is doomed to die. Amidst applause and cheers, she presented a gift to Soong Ching Ling.

That morning, Soong Ching Ling visited the Bombay Tata Textile Mill and Museum. Then, she had lunch with members of the Bombay Province Social Welfare Advisory Committee at the Wellington Sports Club. In the afternoon of the same day, Soong Ching Ling received prominent female educators and social welfare workers from Bombay at the Government Building.

    孟买妇女团体举行宴会欢迎宋庆龄
    新华社孟买二十五日电　孟买二十九个妇女团体在十二月二十四日晚上举行宴会，欢迎宋庆龄。
    宋庆龄在宴会上发表了讲话。她说：“中国和印度的妇女曾经遭受过封建主义和殖民主义的长期压迫。我们两国终于获得了独立。它们现在正在共同努力重建它们各自的国家并且维护亚洲和世界的和平。这就说明了为什么我们两国的妇女必须加强我们的团结，特别是根据五项原则或者潘查希拉来加强我们的团结。这样，中国和印度的五亿妇女就将在国际事务中起到她们的应有的作用。”
    她又说：“在将来，如果我们继续朝这个方向努力，团结各个阶级、各种政治见解、宗教信仰和职业的妇女，来重新建设我们的国家，来争取和平和争取对伟大的五项原则的支持，那末，我敢问，谁敢轻视中印五亿妇女的呼声，谁敢忽视中印十亿人民的这种巨大的力量？”
    宋庆龄最后预祝中印两国妇女的团结日益扩大和加强。全场以热烈的掌声来欢迎她的讲话。
    主持这次宴会的孟买市政府教育官员卡皮拉·康德瓦拉夫人说，中国和印度已经成为世界的重要力量。它们在万隆会议上所表现的领导作用已经表明整个亚洲和非洲的殖民主义是注定要死亡的。她在掌声和欢呼声中向宋庆龄赠送了礼物。
    当天上午，宋庆龄参观了孟买塔塔纺织厂和博物馆。接着，她在惠灵顿运动俱乐部同孟买省社会福利咨询委员会的委员们共进午餐。宋庆龄在同一天下午在政府大厦接见了孟买著名的女教育家们和社会福利工作者们。
