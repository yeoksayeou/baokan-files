Fake Self-Criticisms Are Not Allowed

    Liu Changke, the Party Secretary of the Wangdian District Committee in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, made the following self-criticism to the county committee after participating in the county's centralized Party rectification: "In the work of developing Party members, our district has also committed right-leaning errors. Forty development targets in our district who met the requirements for joining the Party have not been admitted." Can such a self-criticism be considered bad? However, when the Organization Department of the county committee asked the Wangdian District Committee to submit a list of these forty development targets, the Wangdian District Committee could not produce it. After repeated urging from the Organization Department of the county committee, Liu Changke and the members of the district committee pieced together a list of "development targets." This list contained thirty-six "development targets," of which eleven were new Party members who had already been admitted, and another six did not meet the requirements for joining the Party at all. It turned out that Liu Changke's self-criticism was false. Currently, there are indeed many Party members like Liu Changke who, in order to gain the trust of their superiors, do not hesitate to falsely report work achievements or make false self-criticisms. Such vile qualities in Party members are not allowed within our Party.

    不允许假检讨
    中共湖北省孝感县王店区区委书记刘长科参加县的集中整党后，曾主动地向县委作了这样的检讨：“在发展党员的工作上，我区也同样犯了右倾错误。我区有四十个具有入党条件的发展对象都没有接收入党。”这样的检讨能说不好吗？但是等县委组织部要王店区委上报这四十名发展对象名单的时候，王店区委却拿不出来了。在县委组织部再三催促之下，刘长科同区委委员东拉西扯地拼凑了一份“发展对象”的名单。这份名单上共列了三十六名“发展对象”，其中有十一名是已经接收入党的新党员，另六名根本没有具备入党条件。原来，刘长科的检讨是假的。现在，确有不少像刘长科这样的党员，为了骗取上级的信任，不惜假报工作成绩或进行假的检讨。在我们党内，是不容许有这种恶劣品质的党员的。
