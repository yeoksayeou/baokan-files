Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The Chinese translation of "The Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 1, was published on the 27th. The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch will begin distributing it to pre-order customers starting on the 28th. Beginning in January 1956, it will be distributed successively in major cities across the country.

The Chinese translation of "The Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 1, includes four works by Lenin from the early stages of his revolutionary activities (1893-1894): "New Economic Developments in Peasant Life," "On the So-Called Market Question," "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats," and "The Economic Content of Narodism and Its Criticism in Mr. Struve's Book."

In these works against the Narodniks and the "Legal Marxists," Lenin used the weapons of Marxism to make a scientific analysis of the Russian economic system at the time, and explained many programmatic principles and tasks of the Russian proletarian revolutionary struggle. In the 1880s, Plekhanov and his "Emancipation of Labor" group dealt a heavy blow to the erroneous views of Narodism, but Narodist ideology was not completely crushed. The Narodniks believed that Russia could avoid the path of capitalist development and that the peasantry, rather than the working class, would play the main role in the revolution. The remnants of Narodism obstructed the spread of Marxist ideas in many ways, attacked Marxism, and openly slandered Marxism. At that time, it was necessary to thoroughly crush Narodism ideologically in order to ensure the further spread of Marxist ideas in Russia and the establishment of an independent Marxist party. Lenin completed this task.

In the spring of 1893, Lenin wrote "New Economic Developments in Peasant Life." This is Lenin's first preserved work. In this work, Lenin criticized the Narodniks' absurd theories that the peasantry was a unified whole, that there were no capitalist production relations in the Russian countryside, and so on. Lenin used concrete materials to prove that capitalist production relations were rapidly growing in the countryside, that the peasantry had been divided into poor, middle, and rich peasants, and that the phenomenon of wealth disparity among the peasants was very significant. Lenin proved that the new economic changes in peasant life were the differentiation of the peasantry into two extremes.

Lenin wrote "On the So-Called Market Question" in the autumn of 1893. This article was not found and published until 1937. In this work, Lenin formulated the famous pattern of capitalist development, indicating the historical process of the transformation of natural economy into commodity economy, and the process of the disintegration of simple commodity economy into capitalism. Lenin struck at the Narodnik theory that capitalism could not develop in Russia due to the lack of a market, and explained in the spirit of Marxism how the Russian economic system was constituted and why it was constituted in this way. Lenin used statistical materials from many Russian provinces to prove that the peasants had gradually become related to the market. Lenin finally concluded that what we see in Russia is the process of commodity economic development and capitalist growth, and that capitalism is the basic background of Russian economic life. At the same time, Lenin also criticized the incorrect views held by some Marxists in St. Petersburg on the issue of capitalist development in Russia in this work. These Marxists only acknowledged the progressiveness of capitalism, while ignoring the various contradictions of capitalism! They ignored the fact that the working masses were becoming increasingly impoverished and bankrupt under the capitalist system, and did not understand the significance of the proletariat's active revolutionary struggle.

Lenin's famous book "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats" was written in 1894. In this work, Lenin made a comprehensive criticism of the Narodniks' worldview, economic views, political program, and tactics.

The Narodniks did not understand the laws of social development and believed that the course of history could be arbitrarily changed according to the wishes of individual "outstanding" figures. Lenin destroyed this subjectivist view, pointing out that the historical process is determined by the objective laws of economic development, and that people's ideology and habits depend on the material living conditions of society. The Narodniks denied the role of the people in history. Lenin pointed out that only the people are the creators of history, that the actions of individual figures depend on class action, and that class struggle determines the development of society.

In this work, Lenin tore apart the mask of the liberal Narodniks and exposed the true face of these "friends of the people" who opposed the people, rejected revolutionary struggle, and advocated compromise with the Tsarist government. Lenin proved the regularity of the degeneration of Narodism and exposed the class nature of the liberal Narodniks representing the interests of the rich peasants. Lenin pointed out that only Marxists are true friends of the people, and their aim is to eliminate the oppression of landlords and capitalists and overthrow the rule of the Tsar.

Lenin's "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats" is a true manifesto of the Russian communists. In this book, Lenin defended and demonstrated the foundation of the Marxist worldview, defined the basic tasks of the Russian Marxists, correctly pointed out the path of struggle of the working class, and affirmed that the working class is the advanced revolutionary force of society, and the peasants are the allies of the working class. This work is divided into three parts, but the second part has not been found to this day.

While fighting the Narodniks, Lenin also opposed the so-called "Legal Marxists." The "Legal Marxists" fought Narodism in their own way, and they wanted to use this struggle and the banner of Marxism to subordinate the workers' movement to the interests of the bourgeoisie. They abandoned the most important thing in Marxist theory, namely, the theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

As soon as "Legal Marxism" was born, Lenin recognized it as a representative of the bourgeois liberals. In his struggle against the "Legal Marxists," Lenin first opposed their main thinker, Struve, who wanted everyone to "recognize their own uncivilization and learn from capitalism."

For this purpose, Lenin wrote "The Economic Content of Narodism and Its Criticism in Mr. Struve's Book" at the end of 1894 and the beginning of 1895. In this work, Lenin thoroughly criticized "Legal Marxism," emphasizing that Struve had abandoned the most important principle of Marxism - the theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin believed that the main fault of Struve and other "Legal Marxists" was that they held a bourgeois objectivist attitude, defended capitalism, praised capitalism, and erased various class contradictions. Lenin pointed out that true Marxist materialists should boldly expose these contradictions and stand on the position of the revolutionary proletariat. Lenin said that materialism itself contains what is called partisanship, which requires that in any estimate of events, one must straightforwardly and openly stand on the position of a certain social group. Lenin sharply criticized bourgeois objectivism and confronted it with the militant partisanship of Marxists.

In this way, even before the emergence of Bernsteinism in Western Europe, Lenin gave a head-on blow to the act of distorting Marxism in Russia. He educated the Russian Marxists to conduct an uncompromising struggle against the act of distorting Marxism.

In these works in the first volume of "The Complete Works of Lenin," Lenin defended and demonstrated Marxism, defined the tasks of the Russian Marxists, and provided a model for using Marxist theory to study and explain the economic and political conditions of Russia.

The Chinese translation of "The Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 1, was translated by the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and published by the People's Publishing House.

### “列宁全集”第一卷中译本出版

    “列宁全集”第一卷中译本出版
    新华社二十七日讯  “列宁全集”第一卷中译本二十七日出版。二十八日起新华书店北京分店开始向预订读者发行。一九五六年一月起将在全国各大城市先后发行。
    “列宁全集”第一卷中译本包括列宁在革命活动初期（一八九三—一八九四年）的四篇著作：“农民生活中新的经济变动”、“论所谓市场问题”、“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”和“民粹主义的经济内容及其在司徒卢威先生的书中受到的批评”。
    在这些反对民粹派和“合法马克思主义者”的著作中，列宁运用了马克思主义的武器，对当时的俄国经济制度作了科学的分析，并说明了俄国无产阶级革命斗争的许多纲领性的原理和任务。十九世纪八十年代，普列汉诺夫及其“劳动解放社”对民粹主义的错误观点给了沉重的打击，但民粹主义思想并未被彻底粉碎。民粹派认为俄国可以避免资本主义的发展道路，认为将来在革命中起主要作用的是农民而不是工人阶级。民粹主义的余孽多方阻碍马克思主义思想的传播，极力攻击马克思主义，公开诽谤马克思主义。当时必须在思想上彻底粉碎民粹主义，才能保证马克思主义思想在俄国的进一步传播和建立起独立的马克思主义政党。列宁完成了这一任务。
    一八九三年春，列宁写了“农民生活中新的经济变动”一文。这是被保存下来的列宁的第一篇著作。在这篇著作中，列宁批判了民粹派关于农民是统一的整体、俄国农村中没有资本主义生产关系等等荒谬理论。列宁用具体材料证明农村中资本主义生产关系正在迅速增长，农民已经分成贫农、中农和富农，农民中贫富悬殊的现象已很显著。列宁证明农民生活中新的经济变动，就是农民向两极分化。
    列宁在一八九三年秋写了“论所谓市场问题”一文。这篇文章直到一九三七年才找到并发表出来。列宁在这篇著作中，制出了有名的资本主义发展图式，表明了自然经济变为商品经济的历史过程，以及简单商品经济陷于解体而变为资本主义的过程。列宁打击了认为资本主义在俄国由于没有市场而不能发展的民粹派理论，用马克思主义的精神解释了俄国经济制度怎样构成以及它为什么正是这样构成的问题。列宁用俄国许多省份的统计材料，证明农民已渐渐和市场发生了关系。列宁最后作出结论说：我们在俄国所看到的是商品经济发展和资本主义增长的过程，资本主义已是俄国经济生活的基本背景。同时，列宁在这篇著作中还批判了彼得堡某些马克思主义者在俄国资本主义发展问题上所持的不正确观点。这些马克思主义者仅仅承认资本主义的进步性，而忽略了资本主义的各种矛盾！忽略了劳动群众在资本主义制度下日益贫穷破产的事实，不懂得无产阶级进行积极的革命斗争的意义。
    列宁的名著“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”，写于一八九四年。列宁在这一著作中对民粹主义的世界观、经济观点、政治纲领和策略做了全面的批判。
    民粹派不懂得社会发展的规律，认为历史的进程可以依照个别“杰出”人物的愿望任意改变。列宁摧毁了这种主观主义的观点，指出历史进程为经济发展的客观规律所决定，人们的思想意识和习惯取决于社会物质生活条件。民粹派否认人民群众在历史上的作用，列宁指出，只有人民才是历史的创造者，个别人物的行动取决于阶级行动，而阶级斗争决定社会的发展。
    列宁在这一著作中，撕破了自由主义民粹派的假面具，揭露了这些“人民之友”反对人民、拒绝革命斗争、鼓吹与沙皇政府妥协的真面目。列宁证明了民粹主义蜕化的规律性，并揭穿了自由主义民粹派代表富农利益的阶级本性。列宁指明，只有马克思主义者才是真正的人民之友，他们的目的是要消灭地主资本家的压迫和推翻沙皇的统治。
    列宁的“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”一书，是俄国共产主义者真正的宣言。列宁在这本书中，捍卫并论证了马克思主义世界观的基础，规定了俄国马克思主义者的基本任务，正确指出了工人阶级的斗争道路，肯定了工人阶级是社会的先进革命力量，农民是工人阶级的同盟者。这一著作共分三编，但第二编一直到现在还没有找到。
    列宁在同民粹派作斗争时，也反对了所谓“合法马克思主义者”。“合法马克思主义者”按自己的方式和民粹主义进行过斗争，他们想利用这一斗争和马克思主义的旗帜来使工人运动服从于资产阶级的利益。他们抛弃了马克思理论中最主要的东西，即关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。
    “合法马克思主义”刚一诞生，列宁就识破它是资产阶级自由派的代表。列宁在同“合法马克思主义者”作斗争时，首先反对他们的主要思想家，即要大家“承认自己的不文明并向资本主义学习”的司徒卢威。
    为此目的，列宁在一八九四年底和一八九五年初写了“民粹主义的经济内容及其在司徒卢威先生的书中受到的批评”。列宁在这部著作中，透彻地批判了“合法马克思主义”，着重指出司徒卢威抛弃了马克思主义的最主要的原理——关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。列宁认为司徒卢威以及其他“合法马克思主义者”的主要毛病，就在于他们抱着资产阶级客观主义的态度，替资本主义辩护，赞美资本主义，抹杀各种阶级矛盾。列宁指出，真正的马克思主义唯物论者，应该大胆地揭露这些矛盾，并站到革命无产阶级的立场上来。列宁说，唯物主义本身包含有所谓党性，它要求在对事变作任何估计时都必须直率公开地站到一定社会集团的立场上来。列宁尖锐地批判了资产阶级的客观主义，并以马克思主义者战斗的党性来同它对抗。
    这样，还在西欧伯恩施坦主义出现以前，列宁就对俄国歪曲马克思主义的行为，给予迎头痛击。他教育俄国马克思主义者，要对曲解马克思主义的行为进行毫不调和的斗争。
    在“列宁全集”第一卷中的这些著作中列宁捍卫并论证了马克思主义，规定了俄国马克思主义者的任务，并作出了把马克思主义理论用来研究和解释俄国经济和政治状况的典范。
    “列宁全集”第一卷中译本是中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局翻译；人民出版社出版的。
