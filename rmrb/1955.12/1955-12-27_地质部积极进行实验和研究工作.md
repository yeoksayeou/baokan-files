    The Ministry of Geology Actively Conducts Experiments and Research
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In the past few years, geological personnel of the Ministry of Geology, while learning from advanced Soviet science and experience, have focused on scientific research and experimental work in conjunction with mineral exploration and prospecting, and have achieved certain accomplishments.
    Experimental and research work on various minerals is continuing, and some work has already yielded some results. For example, huge ultrabasic rock masses have been discovered in northern China, and the type of chromite contained therein has been determined through experimental research. Preliminary conclusions have also been drawn regarding the enrichment conditions of economically valuable chromite. This provides certain clues for the continued search for chromite in China in the future. In terms of petrographic research on coking coal, the coal petrography research unit of the Ministry of Geology provided petrographic research data for the coking coal required by China's two major iron and steel bases within a short period of one year. These data preliminarily identified the various properties of coal in various coalfields, meeting the needs of design units for coal quality data. For example, a petrographic identification of the coal quality of a huge coalfield in southwestern China confirmed that it was high-quality coking coal. The coal quality of a huge coalfield within Gansu Province could not be determined in the past based on the analysis of oxidized coal samples. Later, through petrographic research, it was confirmed that it was the type of coal needed for coking blending. In the next few years, the Ministry of Geology plans to conduct petrographic characteristic research on the types of coalfields across the country, especially strengthening the research of new coalfields, in order to accurately determine the industrial value of the coalfields and improve the utilization value of various data. In terms of petroleum geology, based on the collation of existing data and field exploration over the past year, a distribution map of oil and potential oil and gas fields in China has been preliminarily compiled. A large amount of oil prospecting work is now being carried out in the various regions indicated on the map. In this year alone, more than sixty well-sealed potential oil-bearing structures have been found in a huge basin in the Northwest, opening up huge prospects for China's oil development. Secondly, the spore pollen analysis research work, which is closely related to the stratigraphic correlation of coalfield geology and petroleum geology, has also achieved certain results. For example, the study of Jilin oil shale was previously thought to belong to the Jurassic period, but now, through spore pollen analysis experiments, it has been proved to be strata of the Old Tertiary period. In addition, research on the mineral processing of apatite and experimental analysis of refractory materials were also carried out this year.
    Geophysical prospecting is a very complex science. Over the past year, the Ministry of Geology has conducted four research and experimental projects in this area that were unprecedented. This year, the geological department experimented, designed and researched "AC equipotential line method", "metal mine logging", "physical property measurement" and "model experiment" etc. The "AC equipotential line method" is twenty to thirty times more sensitive than the "DC equipotential line method", which significantly improves work efficiency. Previously, China did not have a method for measuring physical properties. The physical property measurements carried out this year are of great help for the interpretation and inference of various physical prospecting results.
    In terms of hydrogeology and engineering geology, preliminary results have been obtained in the study of bentonite. With the help of Soviet experts and in cooperation with relevant units, the Ministry of Geology is conducting research on the bentonite in Chushandian, Henan. Now, we have a further understanding of the component status and geological environment of bentonite, and the tests on physical and mechanical properties have also yielded results. In addition, the 1:3,000,000 "National Hydrogeological Zoning Map" will also be successfully drawn with the collaboration of relevant departments. It will provide the necessary basic data for China's hydrogeological work.
    At present, the Ministry of Geology is taking active measures for scientific research and experimental work in order to seek further development and improvement. The Ministry of Geology is preparing to establish a geological science research institute in the near future in order to carry out geological science research more systematically.

    地质部积极进行实验和研究工作
    本报讯　几年来，地质部的地质人员在学习苏联先进科学和先进经验中，结合矿产普查和勘探工作，有重点地进行了科学研究和实验工作，并已取得一定的成就。
    关于各种矿产的实验、研究工作正在继续进行，其中有些工作已获得若干成果。例如在我国北方已发现巨大的超基性岩体，其中所含的铬矿经实验研究已经确定其矿种，并对有经济价值的铬矿富集条件，也得出了初步结论。这样，就为今后在我国继续寻找铬矿提供了一定的线索。在炼焦用煤的煤岩学研究方面，在短短一年内，地质部煤岩研究单位为我国两大钢铁基地所需炼焦用煤提供了煤岩学研究资料。这些资料，初步鉴定了各煤田煤的各种性质，满足了设计单位对煤质资料的需要。例如，对西南某一巨大煤田的煤质作了煤岩鉴定，证实是品质良好的炼焦煤。甘肃境内某一巨大煤田的煤质，过去根据氧化煤样分析，无法决定煤质的好坏，后来经过煤岩学研究，肯定了是炼焦配煤所需的煤种。在最近几年内，地质部准备对全国各种煤田的类型进行煤岩特性研究，特别是加强新区煤田的研究，以便准确地得出煤田的工业价值和提高各项资料的使用价值。在石油地质方面，一年来根据已有资料的整理和野外的勘察，已初步地编制了我国石油和可能油、气田的分布图。现正在图中所标明的各地区内进行大量的石油普查工作。这一年中，仅在西北一个巨大盆地中就找到了六十多个封闭良好的可能储油构造，为我国石油开辟了巨大的前景。其次，同煤田地质和石油地质的地层对比有密切关系的孢子花粉分析研究工作，也取得了一定的成果。例如对吉林油页岩的研究，过去一直认为是属于侏罗纪的，现在经孢子花粉的分析实验，证明是老第三纪的地层。除此之外，今年还进行了对磷灰石的选矿研究和耐火材料的试验分析。
    地球物理探矿，是一种很复杂的科学。一年来，地质部在这方面进行了过去未有的四项研究和实验。今年，地质部门实验、设计和研究了“交流等位线法”、“金属矿测井”、“物性测定”和“模型试验”等。“交流等位线法”比“直流等位线法”的灵敏度高二十至三十倍，使工作效率显著提高。以前，我国没有测量物性的办法，今年进行的物性测定，对于各种物理探矿结果的解释和推断有很大帮助。
    在水文工程地质方面，对班脱岩的研究已获初步结果。地质部在苏联专家的帮助下，并同有关单位合作，对河南出山店的班脱岩正在进行研究。现在已经对班脱岩的成分状况和地质环境有了进一步地了解，对物理性质及力学性质的试验也有了结果。此外，三百万分之一的“全国水文地质分区图”在有关部门的协作下，也即将绘制成功。它将为我国水文地质工作提供必需的基本资料。
    目前，地质部对科学研究和实验工作正在采取积极措施以求进一步的发展和提高。地质部准备在最近成立地质科学研究所，以便更系统地开展地质科学的研究工作。
