    The Backward Mountain Village Advances
    Zhao Litian
    At the northern foot of Purple Mountain in Nanjing, there is a village called Shang Wuqi. The village is surrounded by undulating mountains, and transportation is inconvenient. Usually, there is relatively little contact with the outside world. In addition, the district and township leaders did not pay close attention to the work in this village, so in the years since liberation, everything in this village has lagged behind. Take the mutual aid and cooperation movement, for example: sixteen of the village's seventeen mutual aid teams were only nominally in existence. Although poor peasants received land in the land reform, they faced many difficulties in production, which remained unresolved for a long time. For example, when poor peasant Li Yongcai's wife died, he had to take care of three children and cultivate several mu of paddy fields alone, which often delayed the farming season. This year, when it was time to transplant rice seedlings, he wanted to find someone to help, but he asked five people, and each of them refused because they were busy with their own fields. Families with more manpower transplanted their seedlings while it rained; Li Yongcai rushed as fast as he could, but by the time he was ready to start transplanting, the weather had turned dry again. As a result, his several mu of fields only yielded a few dozen jin of rice per mu. Organizing agricultural production cooperatives was even more out of the question. Once, when the district and township cadres mentioned the issue of organizing cooperatives to the village cadres, the village cadres said, "The masses here are backward and cannot possibly run cooperatives. If we were to run one, we could only run one at most, and it would have to be put together by us cadres." Sure enough, when it came time to sign up to prepare for the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative, not a single poor peasant participated.
    Are the Masses Really Backward?
    This year, as crops were generally harvested abundantly and the national agricultural cooperation movement was vigorously developing, the district paid attention to this backward mountain village. This autumn, the CPC Nanjing City Zhongshan Mausoleum District Committee, Nanjing City Public Security Bureau Zhongshan Mausoleum District Branch and other units decided to form a work team to go to Shang Wuqi Village to mobilize the masses and reverse the long-standing backward situation in this village. Before the work team went to the village, they sent people to the village to find out the situation; because they took the wrong approach, they spent three days without learning anything at all. The work team learned from this lesson, and after arriving in the village, they went directly to find active poor peasants. They explained their intentions, encouraged everyone to speak, and then relied on the active elements to hold a series of meetings, such as poor peasant associations, youth associations, and women's associations, in addition to a solidarity meeting of poor and middle peasants. In this way, when the peasants learned that a wave of cooperation was sweeping through the surrounding rural areas, and now cadres had been sent by the district and township to support them, their emotions suddenly boiled over, and the words that had been buried in their hearts for a long time poured out like the spring river. On the night of the poor and middle peasant solidarity meeting, the whole village was stirred up. Many people arrived. As soon as the comrades of the work team spoke, countless hands went up to request the floor. Some said, "Bad people are in power in the village, and the people are not in charge." Some said, "Seeing that other villages have bumper harvests year after year after running cooperatives, we are really envious..." "We were clamoring to run a cooperative last year, but the village cadres wouldn't let us!" Many people who did not have time to speak wrote what they wanted to say on paper and stuffed it into the hands of the comrades of the work team. Those who could not write asked their children to write, urging them on while saying, "Hurry! Hurry!" At the same time, many masses angrily exposed the crimes of counter-revolutionaries running rampant in the village. The work team received more than one hundred pieces of accusation materials.
    This meeting proved that the masses of Shang Wuqi Village were not backward.
    So That's How It Was
    Why was Shang Wuqi Village backward in the past? After the masses were mobilized, the problem came to light. It turned out that reactionary Kuomintang and Three People's Principles Youth League members Lou Yirong, Yang Wanzhong, and Zhou Genrong, had rallied a group of people in the village and carried out sabotage activities. Among them, some had wormed their way into the position of director of the village peasant association. Kuomintang members also sneaked into the village representatives nominated by Yang Wanzhong during the general election. Usually, they committed all kinds of evil deeds in the village, oppressing the masses, suppressing the masses' enthusiasm for production, and using various means to win over and corrupt cadres with unstable stances. Some cadres called these guys brothers and maintained close relationships. The masses demanded solutions to production problems and requested to be organized, but no one would support them. There was a Communist Party member in the village named Huang Changlai who loved to drink, so Lou Yirong treated him to drinks; when Huang Changlai turned fifty, Lou Yirong presided over Huang's "longevity celebration", held many banquets, and personally sat at the door to manage the accounts and collect "gifts". The masses said: Even the Communist Party member is on "their" side!
    Lou Yirong and others exhausted every means to sabotage the mutual aid teams. Middle peasant Yang Dagui originally joined a mutual aid team, but Lou Yirong went to win him over, "helping" him, and inciting him to withdraw from the team. Yang Dagui said, "If I join and then withdraw, it's not right!" Lou Yirong said, "Humph, are you afraid of not finding a reason to withdraw from the team?" While slandering the mutual aid team, he taught Yang Dagui how to withdraw from the team. Yang Dagui returned to the team and really brought up the matter of withdrawing, saying that everyone was not helping him. Many people in the team wanted to improve the mutual aid team and were preparing to run a cooperative, so they educated Yang Dagui and used facts to tell him, "We would rather eat a little later and work hard; who isn't helping you!" However, under Lou Yirong's instigation, Yang Dagui finally withdrew from the mutual aid team. Now, Yang Dagui has come to his senses, and after exposing Lou Yirong's crimes, he said, "I will never be fooled by counter-revolutionaries again, and I guarantee to draw a clear line and take the path of cooperation with everyone!"
    Counter-revolutionaries also used the method of sneaking into mutual aid teams and playing double-dealing tricks to sabotage the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They did not let go of any opportunity to sabotage. Zhou Genrong wormed his way into a mutual aid team, and when he saw that the people in the team wanted to make a waterwheel, he was afraid that if the team improved production, the mutual aid team would be consolidated, so he tried to sabotage it. He said to everyone, "I have water vanes; the team only needs to make water cylinders." After the water cylinders were made, Zhou Genrong took them and filled his own fields with water, and then casually put away the water vanes, not letting everyone use them, which almost affected the team's production.
    When the agricultural cooperation movement was universally launched across the country, Lou Yirong, Zhou Genrong, and others knew that this huge revolutionary storm was irresistible, so they gathered some Kuomintang members and rich peasants, and even coerced and lured a few middle peasants to organize a fake agricultural production cooperative. Poor peasants and middle peasants with high vigilance saw through their plot and not a single one of them participated. Middle peasant Wang Genxin attended their "cooperative preparatory meeting" at the time, but when he discovered their trick, he refused to buy shares and rebuked these guys, saying, "Buy what shares! Running a cooperative must at least be voluntary and have a backbone.... Look at you: whispering and secretive, not even volunteering when you say it's voluntary, and not a single poor peasant is a backbone!" Zhou Genrong wanted to put a big label on Wang Genxin: "Do you support running a cooperative or not?" Wang Genxin answered well: "Cooperatives must be run, and I will run them with the poor peasants, not with you!" Zhou Genrong became angry out of shame and wanted to intimidate him: "You are sabotaging!" "Sabotaging? We'll go to the People's Government for a fair judgment!" Those guys panicked when they heard the People's Government and stopped making a sound. The fake cooperative failed to materialize, so they changed their method of sabotage, claiming that the village "did not have the conditions to run a cooperative", and they opposed anyone who demanded to run a cooperative.
    The People's Government Supports the Masses
    The true colors cannot always be concealed. After the masses of Shang Wuqi Village were mobilized, they exposed the crimes of bad elements one after another, demanding that the People's Government support the masses. The People's Government then arrested the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionaries Lou Yirong, Yang Wanzhong, and Zhou Genrong in accordance with the law. The other bad elements also dared not act recklessly. At this point, the peasant masses all held their heads high and were filled with joy. The village saw the appearance of blackboards, big-character posters, and drawn cartoons run by the farmers themselves. The slide shows of "Catching Special Agents in the Mountains" and "Can't Take That Road" attracted crowds of spectators every night. Young men and women were singing loudly: "Suppress the counter-revolutionaries, everyone is of one heart, the people are in charge, no special agents are allowed to harm the people..." and "The cooperative is our home."
    In particular, when the peasant masses heard the transmission of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," they were unspeakably happy. Poor peasant Li Xiuying said, "Chairman Mao knows what's on our minds, and we will never fail to live up to Chairman Mao's concern; we must run the cooperative!"
    The enthusiasm of the masses for production in the whole village soared, and they all brewed to run cooperatives. In less than eight days, more than eighty households organized five agricultural production cooperatives. The peasants were all smiling and full of energy. "Our cooperative can be established!" became the most frequently discussed everyday topic for the peasants in this village. After Zhou Changjin's wife joined the cooperative, she got up in the middle of the night to feed the livestock. She touched the back of the livestock and said, "We've finally made it to running the cooperative! Eat, eat strong so you can contribute to the cooperative!" Zhou Changjin was awakened by her and said, "You're right; we must make a determined effort to improve this collective undertaking; our cooperative is only allowed to be run well, not badly!"
    In order to study and solve the problem of livestock and farm implements joining the cooperative, many key members of the cooperative -- the preparatory committees -- often worked late into the night; some people had to rush more than ten li to sell vegetables before dawn, but they said: We are in power, we are running a cooperative, and we don't feel tired at all!
    Since the establishment of the cooperative, this Shang Wuqi Village, which lies nestled in the undulating mountains, has seen wisps of smoke rising in the deep night, and as soon as the east turns white, laughing people head towards the beautiful fields.

    落后的山村前进了
    赵力田
    在南京紫金山的北麓，有个上五旗村。村子四面尽是起伏的山峦，交通不便，平时同外边联系也比较少，加上区乡领导方面平时对这个村的工作抓得不紧，所以解放以后几年来，这个村子无论什么事情都老是落在后面。就说互助合作运动吧，村里的十七个互助组，就有十六个有名无实。贫农虽然在土地改革中分到了土地，但是生产上困难很多，长时期得不到解决。像贫农李永才死了妻子，他一个人带着三个小孩种几亩稻田，经常耽误农时；今年插秧的时候，他想找人帮助，找了五个人，个个都因为忙自己地里的活而回绝了他。人手多的人家都趁雨插好了秧；李永才紧赶慢赶，等到要动手插秧的时候，天又旱了起来。结果，他那几亩田每亩只收了几十斤稻。至于组织农业生产合作社就更谈不上了。有一次，区、乡干部向村干部提起组织社的问题，村干部说：“我们这里群众落后，根本不能办社。要办嘛，顶多只能办一个，还要我们干部凑起来。”果然，后来报名筹办农业生产合作社的时候，没有一个贫农参加。
    群众真的落后吗
    在今年农作物普遍丰收和全国农业合作化运动蓬勃开展的时候，区里注意到了这个落后的山村。今年秋天，中共南京市中山陵园区委员会、南京市公安局中山陵园区分局等单位决定组成工作组，到上五旗村去发动群众，扭转这个村子长期以来落后的状况。工作组下村以前，曾经派人先到村里去了解情况；因为路线走得不对，花了三天功夫一点情况也没有了解到。工作组接受了这个教训，下村以后，便直接去找贫农积极分子。他们说明来意，鼓励大家说话，然后依靠积极分子召开了一连串的会议，像贫农会、青年会和妇女会，此外还召开了贫农和中农的团结会。这样，当农民知道四周围的农村掀起了合作化的热潮，而现在区里乡里派了干部来撑腰以后，情绪一下子沸腾起来了，长久埋在心里的话，就像春天的河水一样倾泻了出来。在举行贫农和中农团结会的那天晚上，全村都轰动了。人到得很多。工作组的同志一讲话，无数只手伸起来要求发言。有的说：“村里坏人当道，人民没当家做主。”有的说：“看别的村办社连年丰收，真看得心痒眼红……”“我们去年就闹着要办社了，可是村干部不干！”许多人来不及发言，就把要说的话写在纸上塞到工作组同志的手里。不会写的就让孩子写，一边说着一边催着：“快！快！”同时，也有不少群众愤怒地揭发了反革命分子在村里横行不法的罪行。工作组收到的检举材料在一百件以上。
    这次会议证明了，上五旗村的群众并不落后。
    原来如此
    过去上五旗村为什么落后呢？群众发动起来以后，问题水落石出了。原来，反动派国民党和三青团分子娄意溶、杨万钟和周根荣，在村里拉拢了一帮人，进行了破坏活动。他们之中，有的混上了村农会主任。普选的时候由杨万钟操纵提名的村代表中也钻进了国民党分子。平时，他们在村里为非作歹，欺压群众，打击群众的生产积极性，并且用各种手段拉拢和腐蚀立场不稳的干部。有些干部就和这些家伙称兄道弟，关系密切。群众要求解决生产上的困难，要求组织起来，可是没有人给撑腰。村里有个共产党员叫黄长来，爱喝酒，娄意溶就请黄喝酒；黄长来五十岁的时候，娄意溶主持给黄“上寿”，摆了很多酒席，他亲自坐在门口管账，收“贺礼”。群众说：共产党员也跟“人家”一鼻孔出气了！
    娄意溶等人对互助组用尽一切办法进行破坏。中农杨大桂本来参加了互助组，娄意溶就去拉拢他，同他“互助”，煽动他退组。杨大桂说：“参加了又要退，理亏啊！”娄意溶说：“哼，要退组还怕找不出理由？”他一面诬蔑互助组，一面教杨大桂怎么怎么去退组。杨大桂回到组里，真的提出退组的事来，说大家不帮他的忙。组里很多人都想把互助组搞好，准备办社，于是就对杨大桂进行教育，并且拿事实跟他说：“我们宁肯晚一点吃饭都拼着干活，哪一个不帮你的忙啦！”可是，在娄意溶的煽动下，杨大桂最后还是退出了互助组。现在，杨大桂觉悟过来了，他揭发了娄意溶的罪行以后说：“我再不上反革命分子的当了，保证划清界限，同大家一起走合作化的道路！”
    反革命分子还用钻到互助组里耍两面派手段的办法来破坏互助合作运动。他们不放过一个可以破坏的机会。周根荣钻进一个互助组，看见组里的人要制水车，他怕组里搞好了生产，互助组就巩固了，于是就设法破坏。他对大家说：“我有水页子，组里光制水筒就行了。”等水筒制好了，周根荣却拿去把自己的田里车满了水，又随手把水页子收起来，不给大家用，这几乎使互助组的生产受到影响。
    当农业合作化运动在全国普遍开展起来的时候，娄意溶、周根荣等人知道这个巨大的革命风暴是不可抗拒的，于是就纠合了一些国民党分子和富农，还强拉诱骗了几个中农，组织起假农业生产合作社来。贫农和警惕性高的中农看穿了他们的阴谋，一个也不去参加。中农王根炘当时去参加了他们的“筹社会议”，但当他发现了他们的诡计的时候，就拒绝入股，并且斥责这些家伙说：“入什么股！办社起码要自愿，要有骨干……。看看你们的吧：叽叽咕咕、鬼鬼祟祟，说自愿都不自愿，说骨干一个贫农也没有！”周根荣想给王根炘扣大帽子：“你到底拥护办社不拥护？”王根炘回答得好：“社是要办的，我要跟贫农一起办，不跟你们办！”周根荣老羞成怒，想威吓一下：“你破坏！”“破坏？我们到人民政府评评去！”那些家伙一听到人民政府就着了慌，不再哼气了。假社没办成，他们就改变了破坏办法，扬言村里“办社不够条件”，一有人要求办社，他们就反对。
    人民政府给群众撑腰
    真面目总是掩饰不住的。上五旗村群众发动起来以后，纷纷揭发了坏分子的罪行，要求人民政府给群众撑腰。人民政府便依法逮捕了首恶的反革命分子娄意溶、杨万钟和周根荣。其他的坏分子也不敢胡作非为了。这下子，农民群众个个扬眉吐气，喜气洋洋。村里出现了农民自己新办的黑板报、大字报和画的漫画。幻灯放映的“山中捉特务”、“不能走那条路”，每晚都吸引着成群结队的观众。青年男女在高唱着：“镇压反革命，大家一条心，人民当家来做主，不许特务害人民……”和“合作社是咱们的家”的歌。
    特别是，当农民群众听了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”报告的传达以后，真是说不尽的高兴。贫农李秀英说：“毛主席知道了我们的心事，我们决不辜负毛主席的关心，一定办社！”
    全村群众生产热情高涨，纷纷酝酿办社，不到八天功夫，就有八十多户筹组了五个农业生产合作社。农民们个个眉开眼笑，浑身是劲。“我们的社可办成啦！”变成了这个村的农民最爱谈的家常话。周长金的妻子入社以后，在深夜里起来喂养牲口。她摸着牲口的背说：“可熬到办社啦！吃吧，吃壮了好给社里出力啊！”周长金被她惊醒了，说：“你说得对，我们这下子可要下狠劲搞好这个大家当，我们的社只准办好，不准办坏！”
    为了研究解决牲口、农具入社的问题，很多办社的骨干——筹委们经常工作到深夜；有的人虽然在天亮以前要赶十多里路去卖菜，可是他们说：我们当了权、办了社，什么也不觉得累啦！
    办社以来，这个横卧在起伏的山峦中的上五旗村，在深夜就升起袅袅炊烟，东方刚一发白，欢笑的人们就走向美丽的田野。
