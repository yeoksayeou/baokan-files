Lessons from the "Xihe" Dredger Sinking Case

The “Xihe” dredger sinking case, prosecuted by the Tianjin Maritime Transport Procuratorate, has been lawfully adjudicated by the Tianjin Maritime Transport Court, giving the criminals Wang Baofu, Li Ruiting, and Liu Xiaoxian the criminal punishments they deserve. This is entirely necessary and correct.

There were three direct causes of the sinking of the "Xihe": First, the "Meiling" steamer, responsible for towing the "Xihe" from Yantai back to Tianjin, did not load enough coal before departure, resulting in insufficient fuel after encountering headwinds en route; Second, when encountering headwinds during the voyage, Wang Baofu, the acting captain of the "Meiling", and navigator Li Ruiting did not take active measures, such as returning to port, approaching an island, or calling for help from passing ships. They violated the will of the crew and easily decided to abandon ship when the "Xihe" was already leaking; Third, after the "Meiling" sailed to its destination alone, it concealed the critical situation of the "Xihe"'s leak, preventing the enterprise management from immediately and actively carrying out rescue efforts.

Why didn't the "Meiling" have enough fuel? Was there no coal? No. Would they not give them coal? No. It was merely because Wang Baofu asked the Yantai work area for special grade coal, and the work area only agreed to give grade one coal. The "Meiling" crew and the work area therefore had a dispute, and after insisting without success, Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting risked setting sail without adding fuel. Grade one coal is the usual fuel for ships, but Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting did not properly educate the crew, intending to abandon ship midway if they encountered wind and waves, rather than using grade one coal. They were gambling with the lives of so many people and state property!

Li Ruiting had the intention of abandoning ship at the time of departure; and when this intention was discovered and questioned by others, Wang Baofu used deceptive means to cover it up. Therefore, after the wind rose midway, they resolutely refused to return to port or approach an island, did not call for help when other ships passed, and did not report the emergency situation after returning. Therefore, they must bear serious criminal responsibility, both in terms of motive and effect.

Liu Xiaoxian, the temporary person in charge of the Yantai work area, neglected safety preparations, still instructing the crew of the "Xihe" to go to "Dagu No. 1" to complete another task on the day of departure; before the departure, the crew of the "Xihe" proposed to Liu Xiaoxian to remove the moss from the bottom of the ship to facilitate navigation, and although he verbally agreed, he did not send anyone to do it; anticipating wind after the snow, he did not insist that the "Meiling" load enough grade one coal, but instead encouraged it to set sail. Therefore, he must also bear certain criminal responsibility in this case.

The problem is very clear: In order to ensure that similar criminal events do not occur again, to protect state property, and to uphold the seriousness of the revolutionary legal system, the criminals in the "Xihe" sinking case must be given legal sanctions.

However, in the process of handling this event, two erroneous views emerged.

One erroneous view is to call the sinking of the "Xihe" a "technical accident," a "mixed technical and responsibility accident," or, while admitting that it was a "responsibility accident," to believe that Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting should not be prosecuted. They intentionally or unintentionally exonerated the criminals.

This view is incorrect. Our country's law is a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship and protects the interests of the working people; however, individual members of the masses, if they break the law and infringe upon the interests of the state and the people, must also be subject to legal sanctions. For those who should be subject to legal sanctions, the state must impose legal sanctions, regardless of who they are. Wang Baofu and Li Ruiting did not take any measures when the wind and waves increased and the fuel was insufficient, and they did not actively seek help when they encountered the "Democratic No. 8" vessel, but easily abandoned the already leaking "Xihe" in the wind and waves. Afterwards, they concealed the situation from the leadership and did not actively carry out rescue efforts, and shifted the blame to others. Should their actions still be legally forgiven? The state must impose legal sanctions on such criminals who intentionally damage state property and trifle with the lives of the people, in order to eradicate similar incidents. However, some comrades believe that such incidents do not seem to violate state law and should not be subject to legal sanctions. If we were to act according to their opinions, it would not only fail to eradicate such incidents, but might even encourage the development of criminal behavior.

Some comrades also believe that enterprise management is not yet sound, and there are many shortcomings and loopholes, so the main blame should be placed on the poor management of the entire enterprise, and not on punishing individual criminals. This is also incorrect. This is confusing general management problems with direct criminal behavior. If the saying of these comrades could be established, then any criminal could find an excuse to escape blame and attribute their criminal behavior to objective reasons.

It should be admitted that the "Xihe" sinking incident did expose many serious shortcomings in the management of maritime transport enterprises, such as the failure to strictly implement navigation regulations, the system being incomplete, the tendency of some units to neglect production safety being quite serious, and labor discipline being very lax, and so on. These serious shortcomings must be quickly overcome. However, these shortcomings in enterprise management cannot be confused with or offset the criminal behavior of Wang Baofu and others; these shortcomings cannot bear direct responsibility for the sinking of the "Xihe". Another erroneous view is that Liu Xiaoxian's neglect of safety was "for the sake of work," seemingly "excusable," and should not be subject to legal sanctions. This view is equally incorrect. The failure to make good preparations before the "Xihe" went to sea, and the "Meiling" setting sail without adding enough fuel, are all inseparable causes of this incident. The bad consequences brought about by Liu Xiaoxian's dereliction of duty are unforgivable, and he must be subject to legal sanctions.

We are by no means punishing for the sake of punishment. In the handling of the "Xihe" sinking case, there was also absolutely no element of "pure punishment." The viewpoint of pure punishment generally denies the role of education, and believes that punitive measures can solve all problems. This is what we have always firmly opposed. However, we are also not like "education omnipotence" theorists, believing that all problems can be solved by educational methods. Therefore, we have always advocated the combined use of legal sanctions and education. Of course, legally sanctioning individual criminals is still to educate the majority. For criminals sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, sentencing is to help them reform and start anew, and no longer commit crimes. Our country's laws ensure the orderly progress of the revolutionary cause and prevent criminal acts that endanger the interests of the people. Everyone should consciously abide by the law. Whoever violates the law must be subject to legal sanctions, without exception. The handling of the "Xihe" case exposed that some staff members seriously lack a concept of revolutionary legality, and they must correct their erroneous thinking in the future and resolutely uphold the seriousness of the people's law.

### “西河”号挖泥船沉没案件的教训

    “西河”号挖泥船沉没案件的教训
    由天津海上运输检察院提起公诉的“西河”号挖泥船沉没案件，已经由天津水上运输法院依法给予犯罪分子王宝福、李瑞亭、刘孝先以应得的刑事处分，这是完全必要和正确的。
    “西河”号沉没的直接原因有三个：第一、负责拖“西河”号由烟台回天津的
  “没凌”号轮船，在起航之前没有带上足够的用煤，以致中途在遭遇逆风以后燃料不足；第二、在航行途中遭遇逆风袭击的时候，“没凌”号代理船长王宝福、领航员李瑞亭没有采取积极措施，比如回航、靠岛、向过往轮船呼救等等，他们违反船员公意，在“西河”号已经漏水的情况下，轻易地决定抛船；第三、“没凌”号单独开到目的地以后，隐瞒了“西河”号漏水的危急情况，使企业管理方面没有能够立即积极进行营救。
    为什么“没凌”号没有带足燃料呢？是没有煤吗？不是。不给煤吗？也不是。仅仅是因为王宝福向烟台工区要特号煤，而工区只答应给一号煤，“没凌”号船员和工区因此发生争执，坚持不下，最后王宝福、李瑞亭便不加燃料而冒险开航。一号煤是通常轮船燃料，但是王宝福和李瑞亭不对船员进行正确教育，打算倘若遇到风浪袭击宁可中途抛船，也不愿意要一号煤。他们就这样拿多少人的生命和国家财产来赌气！
    李瑞亭在出发的时候就有了抛船的企图；而在这个企图被别人发现，提出质问的时候，王宝福又用欺骗手段掩盖过去。因此，中途风起之后，他们就坚决不回航，不靠岛，见别的轮船路过也不呼救，回去以后也不报告危急情况。因此，不论从动机或者从效果来看，他们都必须担负严重的刑事责任。
    烟台工区临时负责人刘孝先忽视安全准备工作，在“西河”号出航的当天仍然叫船员到“大沽一号”去完成另外的任务；出航以前“西河”号的船员向刘孝先提出铲除船底苔茅以利航行，他虽然口头赞成，但不派人去做；预料到雪后有风，他也不坚持要“没凌”轮上足一号煤，反而劝它开航。因此，他在这一案件中也必须担负一定的刑事责任。
    问题十分明显：为了保证不再发生类似的犯罪事件，保护国家财产，为了严肃革命法制，对“西河”号沉没案件的犯罪分子就必须给予法律的制裁。
    但是，在处理这一事件的过程中，出现了两个错误看法。
    一个错误的看法是把“西河”号的沉没称为“技术事故”，称为“技术、责任混合事故”，或者，虽然承认是“责任事故”，却认为对王宝福、李瑞亭不应该实行法办。他们有意或无意地为犯罪分子开脱罪责。
    这种看法是不对的。我们国家的法律是人民民主专政的武器，是维护劳动人民利益的；但是，人民群众中的个别分子，如果犯了法，侵害了国家和人民的利益，也是要受到法律制裁的。对于应该受法律制裁的，国家就一定要给以法律制裁，而不管他是什么人。王宝福和李瑞亭在风浪渐大和燃煤不足的时候不采取任何措施，遇见“民主八号”轮不积极求救，就轻易地把已经漏水的“西河”号抛弃在风浪之中，事后又向领导方面隐瞒情况，不积极营救，并且嫁祸于人，他们的行为难道还应该得到法律的饶恕吗？国家对于这种有意损害国家财产、玩忽人民生命的犯罪分子，必定要实行法律制裁，以求根绝类似事件。然而有些同志却认为这类事件似乎并不违犯国家法律，不应该实行法律制裁。依照他们的意见做去，就不仅不能根绝这类事件，甚至可能助长犯罪行为的发展。
    有的同志还认为，企业管理现在还不健全，有许多缺点和漏洞，所以主要应该责备整个企业管理不善，而不应该惩罚犯罪分子个人。这也是不对的。这是把一般的经营管理上的问题同直接的犯罪行为混淆起来了。如果这些同志的这种说法能够成立，那末任何犯罪分子就都可以找到摆脱罪责的借口，都可以把他们的犯罪行为归咎于客观原因了。
    应该承认，“西河”号沉没事件的确暴露了海上运输企业在管理方面有许多严重缺点，例如航行规章没有严格执行，制度还不健全，有些单位忽视生产安全的倾向相当严重，劳动纪律十分松弛，等等。这些严重缺点都必须迅速加以克服。但是，这些企业管理方面的缺点不能同王宝福等人的犯罪行为混为一谈，或相互抵消；这些缺点不能为“西河”号的沉没承担直接的责任。另一个错误的看法是认为刘孝先忽视安全的原因是“为了工作”，似乎“情有可原”，不应该受到法律制裁。这种看法同样是不对的。“西河”号出海以前没有能够作好准备工作，“没凌”轮没有加足用煤而开航，都是这一事件发生的不可分割的原因。刘孝先玩忽职守所带来的恶果是不可原谅的，他必须受到法律制裁。
    我们绝不是为惩罚而惩罚。“西河”号沉没案件的处理过程中，也完全没有“单纯惩罚”的成分在内。单纯惩罚的观点一般地否定教育的作用，而认为用惩罚的手段可以解决一切问题。这是我们从来坚决反对的。但是，我们也不像“教育万能”论者那样，相信一切问题都能用教育的方法来解决。所以我们一贯主张法律制裁和教育兼施并用。当然，法律制裁个别犯罪分子也还是为了教育多数。对于判处有期徒刑的罪犯来说，判刑是为了帮助他们改过自新，不再犯罪。我们国家的法律保障革命事业有秩序地进行，防止那些危害人民利益的犯罪行为。任何人都应该自觉地遵守法律。谁触犯了法律，谁就一定要受到法律的制裁，不能例外。“西河”号案件处理过程中，暴露出有一部分工作人员严重缺乏革命法制观念，他们在今后必须纠正自己的错误思想，坚决地维护人民法律的严肃性。
