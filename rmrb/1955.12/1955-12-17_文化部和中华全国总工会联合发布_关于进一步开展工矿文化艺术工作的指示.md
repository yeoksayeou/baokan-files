The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued "Instructions on Further Developing Cultural and Artistic Work in Factories, Mines, Construction Sites, and Enterprises" in October this year. The instructions pointed out: Cultural undertakings in factories and mines are part of the country's overall cultural undertakings. Government cultural departments and trade union organizations at all levels must resolutely implement the policy of overall planning and gradually bring cultural undertakings in factories and mines into the orbit of the national plan. To this end, government cultural departments should, in the future, promptly invite relevant industrial departments and municipal construction departments, etc., to assist trade union organizations in studying and formulating development plans for cultural undertakings in factories and mines.

According to the principle of overall planning, the instructions pointed out: In the future, the construction of cultural undertakings in the trade union system should focus clearly on the grassroots trade union organizations in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises. There should be a planned development of film projection teams, clubs, and library reading rooms at the grassroots level of trade unions, and vigorous development of amateur cultural and artistic activities among workers. As for other professional cultural undertakings such as theaters, cinemas, professional theater troupes, and cultural work troupes, these should no longer be developed. The activities of the trade union system's cultural undertakings should, in principle, be based in grassroots trade union organizations, concentrated worker areas, and concentrated worker dormitory areas.

The instructions pointed out: Amateur cultural and artistic activities among workers in factories, mines, and enterprises are an important task for conducting current affairs and political propaganda among workers, cultivating communist moral qualities, and resisting and overcoming the corrosion of bourgeois ideology; it is also an effective method to assist professional cultural and artistic organizations in meeting the growing daily cultural needs of workers.

Regarding the principles of amateur cultural and artistic activities for workers, the instructions made a clear explanation: efforts should be made to cooperate with the current political tasks, implement correct ideological content, and especially carry out the struggle against the corrosion of bourgeois ideology, to achieve the goal of conducting communist education for workers; but at the same time, attention must be paid to healthy entertainment. Amateur cultural and artistic activities for workers should adhere to the principles of amateurism and voluntarism, oppose coercion and commandism, and prevent hindering production or developing towards professionalization. In terms of activity formats, they must adapt to the characteristics of factory and mine production, cater to the preferences of the majority of workers, and strive for richness and diversity. In terms of activity content, it is necessary to oppose errors such as not asking about politics and vulgar interests, as well as shortcomings such as a lack of educational significance; it is also necessary to oppose errors such as obliterating the characteristics of literature and art, mechanically combining with production, and being monotonous and uninteresting. The amateur creation of workers should be encouraged and guided.

The instructions requested: Government cultural departments and their subordinate cultural institutions and art troupes must strengthen the idea of serving workers, strengthen guidance for amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers, and strengthen the creation, compilation, publication, and supply of singing materials. Special attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating the creative forces among the workers, compiling and promoting outstanding works of workers, and appropriately holding awards for amateur creations of workers. State-owned theater troupes, art troupes, music working groups, art studios, and cultural centers should include the business guidance of amateur cultural and artistic activities for workers as one of their regular and important tasks. Local cultural departments can also organize qualified folk professional theater troupes to participate in this work. The instructions also pointed out: In carrying out amateur cultural and artistic activities of workers, grassroots trade union organizations should actively strive for the leadership of the factory and mine Party committees and the support of the administration.

Regarding the adjustment and rectification of the existing cultural undertakings of the trade union system, the instructions said: The film projection teams of various industrial trade unions in a city (except for the railway and Second Ministry of Machine Building trade unions) should be gradually unified under the leadership of the city trade union; they should be gradually fixed in mining areas and concentrated worker areas. The existing professional theater troupes and cultural work troupes/teams of the trade union system should be adjusted and rectified by the provincial and centrally-administered municipal-level trade union federations, and no further development will be allowed in the future. Government cultural departments should include the cultural work troupes/teams of the trade union system in the national cultural undertaking plan, and proactively and actively take responsibility for business guidance, cadre training, observation and learning, and material supply; at the same time, theater troupes should be organized in a planned way to perform for workers in factories, mines, construction sites, and enterprises. Theaters and cinemas operated by trade unions, as well as regional cultural palaces and clubs with theater and cinema characteristics, will no longer be developed in the future; existing institutions of this type will be assisted by government cultural departments and, through trade union organizations, will be rationally arranged according to individual circumstances and needs, operated in accordance with the enterprise management policy and uniformly-stipulated systems of the government, and these institutions and their work will be included in the local overall cultural undertaking plan and cultural work plan. Cultural centers in mining areas and concentrated worker areas should implement the policy of facing factories and mines, facing workers, and at the same time appropriately meeting the needs of local residents. District trade union clubs in large cities will no longer be developed in the future; some of them overlap with local cultural centers, and the cultural centers have a better work foundation, so the trade union organizations should consult with the government cultural departments to merge them with the cultural centers according to the local specific circumstances; if it is temporarily necessary for them to exist, the two should closely cooperate in their work. Public libraries and cultural center libraries with conditions under the government cultural departments should assist trade unions in establishing library reading institutions in the trade union system and provide business guidance. Xinhua bookstores in various places should proactively cooperate with the central work and various cultural and educational activities in factories and mines and carry out book and periodical distribution work in factories and mines in a planned way.

The final part of the instructions emphasized: In order to effectively implement the principles, policies, and various specific measures of cultural work in factories and mines, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen and improve the leadership of government cultural departments and trade union organizations over cultural work in factories and mines. Government cultural departments at all levels must include cooperating with trade union organizations to carry out cultural work in factories and mines as one of their main tasks in the future, and cultural departments in centrally-administered municipalities and provincial-administered municipalities should focus on this as their work focus, and provincial cultural departments should also place a certain amount of leadership on cultural work in factories and mines. Trade union organizations should actively establish and enrich the management institutions at all levels for cultural work to gradually strengthen the leadership and management of trade union cultural undertakings. Government cultural departments and trade union organizations at all levels should establish the necessary systems for liaison work, and when necessary, take appropriate ways to establish certain institutions for liaison work to strengthen mutual contact and cooperation and timely study and solve problems in the work.

    关于进一步开展工矿文化艺术工作的指示
    中华人民共和国文化部和中华全国总工会在今年十月间联合发布了“关于进一步开展厂矿、工地、企业中文化艺术工作的指示”。指示指出：工矿文化事业是国家整个文化事业的一部分。各级政府文化部门和工会组织必须坚决贯彻统筹安排的方针，逐步地将工矿文化事业纳入国家计划的轨道。为此，政府文化部门今后应该及时邀请有关工业部门和市政建设部门等，协助工会组织研究制定工矿文化事业发展计划。
    根据统筹安排的原则，指示指出：今后工会系统文化事业的建设，应该明确以厂矿、工地、企业的工会基层组织为重点，应该有计划地发展工会基层的电影放映队、俱乐部和图书阅览室等事业，大力开展职工群众的业余文化艺术活动；至于其他专业的文化事业如剧场、影院、职业性的剧团和文工团等应不再发展。工会系统文化事业的活动，原则上以工会基层组织、工人集中区和工人宿舍集中区为基地。
    指示指出：厂矿、工地、企业中的职工群众业余文化艺术活动是向职工群众进行时事、政治宣传、培植共产主义道德品质、抵制和克服资产阶级思想侵蚀的一项重要的工作；同时也是辅助专业文化艺术团体满足职工群众日益增长的日常文化生活需要的一个有效的方法。
    关于职工业余文化艺术活动的方针，指示作了明确的说明：应当努力配合当前的政治任务，贯彻正确的思想内容，特别要开展反对资产阶级思想侵蚀的斗争，以达到对职工群众进行共产主义教育的目的；但同时必须注意健康的娱乐性。职工业余文化艺术活动应坚持贯彻业余、自愿的原则，反对强迫命令，防止妨碍生产或向职业化发展的偏向。在活动方式上，必须适应厂矿生产的特点，照顾多数职工的喜爱，力求丰富多样。在活动内容上，既要反对不问政治、低级趣味等错误和缺乏教育意义的缺点，也要反对抹煞文艺特点、机械地结合生产的错误和枯燥乏味、千篇一律的缺点。应该鼓励和辅导职工的业余创作。
    指示上要求：政府文化部门及所属文化事业单位、文艺团体，必须加强为工人服务的思想，加强对职工业余文化艺术活动进行辅导工作，加强对演唱材料的创作、编选、出版和供应工作，应当特别重视发掘和培养职工群众中的创作力量，编选和推广工人中的优秀作品，并可适当举办职工业余创作的评奖。各国营剧团、文艺团体、音乐工作组、美术工作室、文化馆，应将对职工业余文化艺术活动的业务辅导工作列为自己的经常性的重要任务之一。各地文化部门并可组织有条件的民间职业剧团参加这项工作。指示还指出：工会基层组织在开展职工业余文化艺术活动的工作中，要主动地争取厂矿党委的领导和行政的支持。
    关于调整和整顿现有工会系统的文化事业，指示说：凡在一个市内的各产业工会的电影放映队（铁路和第二机械工会的在外），应该逐步由市工会统一领导；应当逐步地分别固定在工矿区和工人集中区。工会系统的现有职业性的剧团和文工团、队，应由省、中央直属市一级工会联合会加以调整和整顿，今后不再发展。政府文化部门应当将工会系统的文工团、队列入国家文化事业计划以内，在业务指导、训练干部、观摩学习、供给材料等方面主动地和积极地负起责任来；同时应有计划地组织剧团到厂矿、工地、企业中为职工群众演出。工会经营的剧场、影院和具有剧场、影院性质的区域性的文化宫、俱乐部，今后不再发展；现有的这类机构，由政府文化部门协助并且通过工会组织根据各别的情况和需要，加以合理安排，按照企业化方针和政府统一规定的制度加以经营，并将这类机构和它们的工作列入当地整个文化事业计划和文化工作计划以内。工矿地区和工人集中区的文化馆，应当贯彻面向厂矿，面向职工，同时适当地满足当地居民需要的方针。大城市的区工会俱乐部今后不再发展，其中有的同当地文化馆重复，而文化馆又有较好的工作基础，应当由工会组织会同政府文化部门根据当地具体情况把它们和文化馆合并；如果暂时还有存在必要的，二者应该在工作上密切配合。政府文化部门所属公共图书馆和有条件的文化馆图书室，应当协助工会建立工会系统的图书阅览机构，并在业务上给以辅导。各地新华书店应当主动地配合厂矿中的中心工作和各种文教活动，有计划地开展厂矿中的书刊发行工作。
    指示的最后部分强调地指出：为了有效地贯彻工矿文化工作的方针、政策和各项具体措施，必须大力加强和健全政府文化部门和工会组织对工矿文化工作的领导。各级政府文化部门今后必须将协同工会组织开展工矿文化工作列为主要任务之一，各中央直辖市、省辖市文化部门并应以此为工作的重点，省级文化部门亦应以一定的领导力量放在工矿文化工作上面。工会组织应积极地建立和充实文化工作的各级主管机构，以逐步加强工会文化事业的领导和管理。各级政府文化部门和工会组织，应当建立必要的联系工作的制度，必要时并可采取适宜的方式建立一定的联系工作的机构，以加强相互间的联系配合，及时研究和解决工作中的问题。
