In Kangbao County, Hebei Province, there is a Dengyoufang Central Grain Station. On November 18th, just after a rain, a farmer came from Lizhaorang Village, more than 20 li away, to sell grain. He searched for a long time in the grain station's yard but couldn't find anyone. Finally, he discovered that the grain station staff were sitting inside, playing cards and shouting, "Deal! Discard!" The farmer asked them to weigh his grain, but they ignored him. When the farmer repeatedly begged them to weigh it, they impatiently became angry: "We're not just here to serve you!" The farmer had no choice but to go to the Zhangjiakou Prefecture rural work team and, with a letter of introduction from the work team, went to the Grain Exchange (which purchases grain on behalf of the state) to finally sell his grain.

Such incidents are not isolated. In Liangyuan, Leiyang County, Hunan Province, a temporary camellia oil purchasing station was set up. The staff at the purchasing station, Chen Chongsheng and Huang Qinglin, were also extremely irresponsible in their work. They either played cards all day long or ran around outside during working hours. When others suggested that they should actively contact the villages or make purchases at market fairs, they said: Let them bring it to our door themselves! However, many farmers brought camellia oil to their door, and often waited for a long time without finding anyone.

Can the staff of Dengyoufang Central Grain Station and Liangyuan Camellia Oil Purchasing Station complete the tasks assigned to them by the state with this kind of bad attitude of "sitting and waiting for delivery" and "ignoring goods brought to the door"?

### 货上门来也不理睬

    货上门来也不理睬
    河北省康保县有个邓油房中心粮点。十一月十八日刚下过雨，有个农民从二十多里以外的李兆壤村赶来卖粮，在粮点的货场上找了半天也不见人影，最后才发现粮点的工作人员正坐在屋里
  “出呀！甩呀！”地打扑克哩。这个农民请求他们过秤，他们也顾不得理；当农民再三恳求他们过秤时，他们竟不耐烦地发起脾气：“我们不是光为伺候你的！”这个农民没有办法，只好去找张家口专区驻乡工作组，并拿着工作组的介绍信跑到粮食交易所（为国家代购粮食）才把粮食卖掉。
    像这样的事情还不是个别的。湖南省耒阳县亮源设立了个临时茶油收购点。收购点的工作人员陈重生、黄青林，对待工作也是极不负责。他们不是整天打扑克，就是工作时间在外边乱跑。别人提出要他们主动到各乡去联系或逢场收购，他们说：等着他们自己送上门吧！但是，许多农民把茶油送上门来，又常常等上大半天还找不到人。
    邓油房中心粮点和亮源茶油收购点工作人员，采取这种“坐等送上门”、“上门又不理睬”的恶劣态度，还能完成国家交给他们的任务吗？
