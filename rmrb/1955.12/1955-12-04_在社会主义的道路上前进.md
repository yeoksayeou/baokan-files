Advancing on the Road of Socialism

Henan's Total Grain Output This Year Exceeds the 1957 Target

Henan Province's total grain output this year increased by 1,688,814,000 *jin* compared to last year, exceeding the grain production plan target for the final year of Henan's First Five-Year Plan by more than 480 million *jin*. Among them, although the wheat harvest area was reduced by 1,515,000 *mu* compared to last year, the actual output was still 33.39 million *jin* more than last year's bumper harvest, breaking through the planned targets for next year and the year after.

The main reasons for the rapid increase in Henan's total grain output are that by the time of this year's autumn harvest, more than 1,235,000 peasant households across the province had joined agricultural production cooperatives; each agricultural production cooperative led the surrounding farmers to plant more high-yield crops, expand the area of multiple cropping, implement mixed cropping and intercropping, use new agricultural tools, build farmland water conservancy projects, and fight against insect pests. For example, the farmers in the Nanyang Special District used to cultivate extensively, resulting in lower grain yields. This year, the Nanyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on local conditions, proposed five measures to increase production, including changing to high-yield crops and deep plowing and careful cultivation. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the farmers in the entire special district actively adopted these measures, resulting in an increase in grain production of 222,104,100 *jin*.

Anshan Iron and Steel Works Will Further Increase Production of a Large Amount of Pig Iron

The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Iron Smelting Plant have decided to guarantee a further increase in production of 55,000 tons of high-quality iron in the fourth quarter of this year, based on completing the state production plan. In this way, this factory will increase production for the country by 115,000 tons of high-quality iron this year. By the end of the third quarter of this year, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Iron Smelting Plant had already completed the annual plan to increase production of 60,000 tons of pig iron. In order to increase production of more iron for the country, they formulated a plan in early October to further increase production of 40,000 tons of high-quality iron in the fourth quarter of this year. To achieve this plan, a new production competition was launched in each blast furnace. In the competition, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, the workers conscientiously promoted advanced Soviet iron smelting experiences such as steam blast and fixed air volume, and generally increased the blast furnace air temperature from 800 degrees to 900 degrees. After achieving high air temperature operation, the production situation was particularly good, and new records continued to appear. From October 1st to November 25th, they increased production for the country by 31,400 tons of high-quality iron. On November 26th, after discussion, the workers of the Iron Smelting Plant decided to further promote the advanced Soviet iron smelting experience, ensure the high air temperature operation of the blast furnace, and revise the original production increase plan. The revised production increase plan guarantees an increase in production of 55,000 tons of high-quality iron in the fourth quarter. (Our correspondent in Shenyang)

A Batch of Iron Ore Deposits and Phosphate Mines Discovered in Southwest China

Seven iron ore deposits and five important phosphate mines have been discovered in the Southwest region.

Most of these seven iron ore deposits are located in Sichuan Province. Among them, one iron ore deposit has thick ore layers and high iron content, making it the best rich iron ore discovered in the Southwest region so far. After expanding the peripheral survey of a large iron ore mine that began exploration in Sichuan this year, the estimated reserves greatly exceeded the original estimate. Iron ore deposits have also been discovered in both Yunnan and Guizhou provinces this year. In one iron ore deposit discovered in southeastern Guizhou Province, ore layers are discontinuously exposed within an area of ​​100 square kilometers, and the estimated reserves are very abundant, which can supply the construction of a steel plant. Of the two iron ore deposits confirmed in Yunnan Province this year, a large part of one iron ore deposit is rich ore.

Five phosphate mines were discovered in Southwest China. Among them, the Kunyang Phosphate Mine in Yunnan Province has been confirmed by detailed exploration to be one of the largest phosphate mines in China. The Leibo Phosphate Mine in Sichuan Province is also a large phosphate mine. Some of these phosphate mines have a very high phosphorus content and can be directly used as raw materials for phosphate fertilizer without a mineral processing process. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Southwest China, geological data that can be used for mining design will be submitted for two phosphate mines next year. After the exploration of the Kunyang Phosphate Mine in Yunnan Province is completed next year, a large-scale phosphate fertilizer factory will be designed. After the exploration of the Zunyi Phosphate Mine in Guizhou Province is completed next year, it will also provide data for the expansion of the Zunyi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant.

Jining Power Plant Completes Expansion Project

The expansion project of the Jining Power Plant has been completed, and the new generator officially generated electricity on the 2nd. The power generation capacity of this power plant after the expansion is twice as large as the original power generation capacity. The high-voltage transmission lines from the power plant to the substations at Jining North Station have also been erected recently.

The workers who expanded this power plant launched a labor competition during the construction process in order to support the Jining-Erenhot Railway to participate in the joint transportation of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia on time. Their attendance rate has always remained at 98 percent, and they have saved the country 120,000 yuan in investment. (Xinhua News Agency)

Hebei Province Starts Construction of Douhe Reservoir

The Douhe Reservoir, built near Tangshan City, Hebei Province, began constructing warehouses, repair shops, processing plants, and workers' sheds in November, erecting power lines and wooden bridges upstream and downstream of the dam site, laying light railways, and building roads to the construction site. The hub structure and aqueduct project will begin construction in January next year, the earth dam project will be built in March, and the entire reservoir project will be completed before the flood season next year.

Due to the steep slopes and narrow riverbed of the Douhe River, major floods will overflow and cause disasters. In order to eliminate floods and further develop industrial and agricultural production by utilizing water resources, the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department began surveying and drilling work in 1952 and completed the preliminary design in July this year. The Douhe Reservoir is a comprehensive water conservancy project for flood control, water storage, and power generation. The main construction is to build a 3,800-meter-long flood control dam using the gorge between the Fengshan and Liyuan highlands. After the reservoir is completed, it can store more than 100 million cubic meters of floodwater, not only eliminating the threat of floods to Tangshan City, the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway, and 100,000 *mu* of farmland along the river, but also ensuring the factory water use in Tangshan City and the irrigation water use for 40,000 *mu* of farmland along the river during the dry season. In addition, a small hydropower station will be built to supply the electricity needed by the local people. (Ren Jie)

Chao'an County Becomes a "Thousand-Jin Bumper Harvest County"

Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, which has increased production for five consecutive years, has once again reported a bumper harvest this year. The average yield of late rice in the county is 620 *jin* per *mu*. Adding the 403 *jin* per *mu* of early rice this year, the annual yield per *mu* reaches 1,023 *jin*, making it a double-cropping rice "thousand-jin bumper harvest county."

The basic reasons for Chao'an County's consecutive years of bumper harvests are mainly due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the farmers' vigorous construction of water conservancy projects. By the spring of this year, there were 298 agricultural cooperatives and a large number of mutual aid groups in the county, and the number of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation accounted for 67 percent of the total number of farmers. Under the leadership of various agricultural cooperatives, the area of ​​appropriately dense planting of late rice this year accounted for more than 80 percent of the total planting area of ​​late rice, and more than 2,300 various small water conservancy projects for drought prevention and flood control were vigorously built. In particular, the construction of the three major water conservancy projects in the lower reaches of the Han River last winter and this spring freed seven grain-producing areas, including Fengxi and Anbu, from the threat of floods and droughts. During the drought this spring, the Party mobilized more than 350,000 farmers to rush to repair more than 1,500 small water conservancy projects, and built unprecedented temporary projects to block the Han River to fight drought, ensuring irrigation of the fields and obtaining a bumper harvest.

Qinghai Formulates a Ten-Year Immigration and Reclamation Plan

At its recent plenary meeting, the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee approved the preliminary ten-year immigration and reclamation plan formulated by the Qinghai Provincial Immigration Resettlement and Reclamation Work Committee. According to this plan, by 1964, Qinghai Province's population will increase by 161 percent compared to the present; the cultivated land area will increase from the current 7 million *mu* to 16.08 million *mu*, and the grain produced can not only supply the province's consumption but also have a surplus of more than 1.4 billion *jin*.

Qinghai Province's ten-year immigration and reclamation work will be carried out in two stages: from this winter to 1958, it will mainly be carried out in the counties (cities) of the agricultural area; from 1959 to 1964, it will mainly be carried out in the Qaidam Basin and several autonomous prefectures such as Haixi, Hainan, Haibei, and Huangnan. This winter and next spring, 26,000 immigrants will come to Qinghai Province. At present, the agricultural production cooperatives in the counties (cities) of the agricultural area are making preparations for these immigrants to settle down.

The existing cultivated land area in Qinghai Province accounts for only 0.6 percent of the total land area of the province. In addition to having enough grassland and pastures to develop animal husbandry production, there is also a vast area of ​​cultivable wasteland, with more than 30 million *mu* in the Qaidam Basin alone. Most of these wastelands are fertile soil and flat land. (Xinhua News Agency)

Two Thousand Three Hundred Rural Film Projection Teams

The number of rural film projection teams across the country has increased by more than 800 this year, and it is planned to increase by more than 100 by the end of the year. Now, there are more than 2,300 film projection teams in rural areas across the country, with an average of one in each county, and a small number of counties have more than two. This year, the audience of rural film projection teams is expected to reach more than 380 million person-times, an increase of more than 60 million person-times compared to last year.

Among the films screened, the most popular with farmers are "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "People Strive for Higher Positions," "Light Shines on the Highland Village," and the short film "New Countryside." Before the mass meeting in Xingyang Township, Guangxi Province, to discuss joining the cooperative, the Long'an County Film Projection Team screened the film "People Strive for Higher Positions" for the farmers. After watching the movie, the farmers launched a heated discussion at the meeting. Ma Renmou, a farmer who had originally doubted whether there were any benefits to joining the cooperative, also signed up to apply to join the cooperative. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在社会主义的道路上前进
    河南今年粮食总产量超过一九五七年指标
    河南省今年粮食总产量比去年增加十六亿八千八百一十四万斤，比河南省第一个五年计划的最后一年的粮食生产计划指标还多四亿八千多万斤。其中小麦虽然收获面积比去年减少一百五十一万五千亩，但是实际产量却比去年丰收年景还多三千三百九十万斤，突破了明年和后年的计划指标。
    河南省粮食总产量迅速提高的主要原因是，今年秋收前全省已经有一百二十三万五千多户农民参加了农业生产合作社；每个农业生产合作社带动周围农民多种高产作物，扩大复种面积，实行混作、间作，使用新式农具，兴修农田水利和向虫害作斗争。如南阳专区的农民过去耕作粗放，粮食产量较低。今年中共南阳地方委员会根据当地条件，提出改种高产作物、深耕细作等五项增产措施。全专区农民在互助合作组织带动下，积极采取这些措施，结果增产粮食二亿二千一百零四万一千多斤。（新华社）
    鞍钢炼铁厂将再增产大量生铁
    鞍钢炼铁厂职工决定在今年第四季度内在完成国家生产计划基础上保证再增产五万五千吨优质铁。这样，这个厂今年将给国家增产十一万五千吨优质铁。在今年第三季度末，鞍钢炼铁厂的职工们就已经完成了全年增产六万吨生铁的计划，为了给国家增产更多的铁，他们在十月初曾制定了在今年第四季度内再增产四万吨优质铁的计划。为了实现这项计划，新的生产竞赛在各高炉开展起来了。在竞赛中由于苏联专家的帮助，工人们认真推广了苏联蒸气鼓风、固定风量等先进炼铁经验，把高炉的风温由八百度普遍提高到九百度，达到高风温操作后，生产情况特别好，新纪录不断出现，从十月一日到十一月二十五日就给国家增产了三万一千四百吨优质铁。十一月二十六日，炼铁厂职工们经过讨论后决定再进一步推广苏联先进炼铁经验，保证高炉的高风温操作，并修改了原来的增产计划。修改后的增产计划，保证在第四季度内增产五万五千吨优质铁。（本报驻沈阳记者）
    西南发现一批铁矿产地和磷矿
    西南地区先后发现了七个铁矿产地和五个重要的磷矿。
    这七个铁矿产地大部分是在四川境内。其中有一个铁矿产地，矿层厚，含铁品位高，是西南地区目前已经发现的铁矿中最好的一个富铁矿。今年在四川开始勘探的一个大型铁矿经过扩大矿区外围普查后，估计蕴藏量大大超过了原来预计的数字。在云南和贵州两省，今年都同时发现了铁矿产地。在贵州省东南部发现的一个铁矿产地，在一百平方公里的范围内都有矿层断续出露，估计蕴藏量很丰富，可以供给建设一个钢铁厂用。云南省今年证实的两个铁矿产地中，有一个铁矿产地大部分都是富矿。
    西南地区发现的五个磷矿。其中云南省昆阳磷矿经过详细勘探证实是目前中国最大的磷矿之一。四川省的雷波磷矿也是一个大磷矿。这些磷矿，有的含磷成份很高，不经过选矿过程就可以直接作磷肥原料。为了适应西南地区农业合作化运动迅速发展的需要，明年有两个磷矿将要提出可以供开采设计用的地质资料。云南省昆阳磷矿在明年勘探结束以后，将设计一座大型磷肥工厂。贵州省的遵义磷矿明年勘探完毕后，也将为扩建遵义磷肥厂提供资料。（据新华社讯）
    集宁发电厂完成扩建工程
    集宁发电厂扩建工程已经完成，新的发电机在二日正式发电。这个发电厂扩建后的发电能力比原来的发电能力大两倍。由发电厂通往集宁北站各变电所的高压输电线，最近也架设完成了。
    扩建这座发电厂的工人，为了支援集二线按时参加中、苏、蒙铁路联运，在施工中曾经展开了劳动竞赛。他们的出勤率始终保持在百分之九十八，并且为国家节省了十二万元的投资。（新华社）
    河北省陡河水库开始兴修
    建筑在河北省唐山市附近的陡河水库，从十一月份起已开始着手修建仓库、修配厂、加工厂和工棚，架设电线和坝址上下游的木桥，铺设轻便铁道以及通往工地的公路等附属工程。枢纽建筑物和输水道工程将在明年一月开工，土坝工程在三月修筑，全部水库工程将在明年汛期前完工。
    由于陡河坡陡河槽窄小，一遇较大洪水就漫溢成灾，为了消除水患并利用水利资源进一步发展工农业生产，河北省水利厅从一九五二年便开始勘查、钻探工作，今年七月完成初步设计。陡河水库是一项防洪、蓄水、发电综合利用的水利工程，主要建筑是利用凤山和栗园高地中间的峡口，修建一条长达三千八百公尺的拦洪坝。水库建成后，能拦蓄洪水一亿多公方，不仅免除洪水对唐山市、京山铁路和沿河十万亩农田的威胁，并保证枯水季节唐山市的工厂用水和沿河四万亩农田的灌溉用水。另外，还将修建一座小型水力发电站，供应当地人民所需要的电力。（任杰）
    潮安县成了“千斤丰产县”
    连续五年增产的广东省潮安县，今年又告丰收。晚稻全县平均每亩收成六百二十斤，加上今年早稻每亩四百零三斤，全年每亩产量达一千零二十三斤，成为双季连作水稻“千斤丰产县”。
    潮安县连年丰收的基本原因，主要是由于互助合作运动的发展和农民大力兴修水利。到今年春天，全县已有二百九十八个农业合作社和一大批互助组，参加互助合作的农户占总农户的百分之六十七。在各个农业合作社带动下，今年晚稻进行适当密植的面积占晚稻种植总面积百分之八十以上，并大力兴修了防旱、防涝各种小型水利工程二千三百多项。特别是去冬今春兴修韩江下游三大水利工程，使枫溪、庵埠等七个产粮区解除了水旱威胁。今春旱灾时，党又动员了三十五万多农民抢修小型水利一千五百多项，并兴修了史无前例的堵韩抗旱的临时工程，保证了田地灌溉，获得丰收。

    青海拟定十年移民垦荒计划
    青海省人民委员会在最近召开的全体会议上，通过了青海省移民安置垦荒工作委员会所拟订的十年移民垦荒初步计划。按照这个计划，到一九六四年，青海省的人口将比现在增加百分之一百六十一；耕地面积将由现在的七百多万亩增加到一千六百零八万亩，生产的粮食除供应本省食用以外，还可以剩余十四亿多斤。
    青海省十年移民垦荒工作将分两个阶段进行：从今年冬天到一九五八年，主要是在农业区的各县（市）进行；从一九五九年到一九六四年，主要是向柴达木盆地和海西、海南、海北、黄南等几个自治州进行。今冬明春，将有两万六千名移民到青海省。现在，农业区各县（市）的农业生产合作社正在为这些移民进行安家的准备工作。
    青海省现有的耕地面积，只占全省土地总面积的百分之零点六。除了有足够的草山和牧场来发展畜牧业生产以外，还有广大可耕的荒地，仅柴达木盆地就有三千多万亩。这些荒地大部分都是土壤肥沃、地势平坦的好地。（新华社）
    二千三百个农村电影放映队
    全国农村电影放映队今年又增加了八百多个，年底前还计划增加一百多个。现在，全国农村已经有两千三百多个电影放映队，平均每个县有一个，少数的县有两个以上。今年，农村电影放映队的观众预计可以达到三亿八千多万人次，比去年增加六千多万人次。
    放映的影片中，最受农民欢迎的是“春风吹到诺敏河”、“人往高处走”、“光明照到高地村”以及短片“新农村”等。广西省隆安县电影放映队在兴杨乡讨论入社的群众大会之前，给农民放映了影片“人往高处走”。农民看完电影后，在会上展开热烈讨论。原来还怀疑入社是不是有好处的农民马仁谋，也报名申请入社了。
