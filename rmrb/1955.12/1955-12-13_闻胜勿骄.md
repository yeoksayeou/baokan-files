The great development of agricultural cooperation is indeed a great victory and a great happy event. From the beginning of August to the beginning of November, more than 590,000 new agricultural cooperatives were established across the country. Together with the original 650,000 agricultural cooperatives, there are now more than 1.24 million agricultural cooperatives in the country. In just over two months, such a large number of new agricultural cooperatives have been established, and the majority of the original agricultural cooperatives have been expanded. Moreover, the newly established cooperatives generally meet the quality requirements. This significant victory not only encourages the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres but also encourages the people of the whole country to continue to advance with more courage and confidence.

The victory achieved in agricultural cooperation is indeed great, but we should not become arrogant and complacent because of this. On the one hand, the work of establishing and expanding cooperatives in many places is being carried out intensively, and we need to do a lot of work conscientiously. Moreover, even in areas where the establishment and expansion of cooperatives has basically ended, there are still many remaining problems of varying degrees in the newly established cooperatives and the expanded old cooperatives. Among them, apart from the fact that the ideological mobilization in some areas is not sufficient, a small number of peasants are not completely voluntary in joining the cooperatives, the handling of means of production such as land, livestock, and farm tools still has unreasonable phenomena of being too low or too high, the membership composition of a few cooperatives is not pure enough, and the leading advantage of poor peasants has not been firmly established, and even the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants has already occurred, the most prominent problem at present is that quite a few newly established cooperatives have not yet established a set of relatively reasonable production and management systems, and temporary dispatch of labor and other phenomena still exist in large numbers. On the other hand, it should also be seen that even if the quality of the large number of agricultural cooperatives that have been and will be established fully meets the standards, or the remaining problems in the expansion and establishment of cooperatives are resolved one by one, they are generally still semi-socialist in nature and are a form of transition to advanced cooperatives that are fully socialist in nature. To enable an agricultural cooperative to develop from a low-level stage to a high-level stage, abolishing land remuneration is of course very important; but more importantly, it is necessary to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the members and gradually establish a set of management systems that conform to socialist principles. In areas where the development of the agricultural cooperation movement is relatively rapid, many old cooperatives have already put forward the requirements of merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives and transitioning to advanced cooperatives; newly established cooperatives generally require assistance in solving remaining problems, especially in helping them quickly establish normal production order, strengthening guidance on agricultural science and technology work, and supplying them with more and better new farm tools, chemical fertilizers, and other pesticides and agricultural machinery. However, the vast majority of rural workers of the Party and the government not only lack experience in running advanced agricultural cooperatives, but also generally lack experience in leading a large number of low-level cooperatives and do not understand or are not familiar with agricultural science and technology knowledge; at the same time, various rural-related tasks have not kept up closely. This shows that, whether from the requirements of current work tasks or from the experience and level of leadership, we are far from being able to adapt to the changed rural situation. Many new problems are waiting to be solved, and many new tasks are waiting to be done.

However, some rural cadres do not realize this. They are satisfied with the existing achievements and have generated an extremely harmful emotion of blind optimism and complacency. These comrades see that the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants is unprecedentedly high, the broad masses of peasants are rushing to sign up to join the cooperatives, and the awareness and enthusiasm of the members of the original cooperatives have also greatly increased compared with before. Everywhere, a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged, and they mistakenly believe that the agricultural cooperation movement no longer needs the leadership of the Party and no longer needs to do arduous and meticulous work. Therefore, some areas have neglected the ideological mobilization work in the early stage of establishing cooperatives, and some areas have not conscientiously implemented the policy of mutual benefit in the evaluation of means of production, or even used the peasants' eagerness to join the cooperatives to deliberately lower the prices and remuneration of means of production, or even when they find unreasonable places, they do not promptly solve them. It is particularly worth mentioning that in areas where the cooperation movement is developing relatively rapidly, especially in areas where agricultural semi-socialization has basically been realized, the blind optimism and complacency of some Party members and cadres are even more serious. Some people think that a large number of cooperatives have been established, and they should take a rest. Some comrades in the work teams are also eager to ask for leave to return to the city.

This kind of blind optimism and complacency is extremely harmful to the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. Although the work of establishing the third agricultural cooperative in Zhudian Township, Xixian County, Henan Province, was done well, the district and township cadres became arrogant and complacent. They mistakenly believed that the cooperatives established under the high tide of cooperation were completely good, and even if there were some shortcomings, there would be no problems. They did not need to carry out rectification and consolidation work and relaxed their leadership over this cooperative. As a result, when this cooperative turned to production, due to some problems that could not be solved, chaos was created in the cooperative for a while, and the production enthusiasm of the members suddenly declined. It was not until the township Party branch discovered the above problems, criticized and corrected this complacency, and rectified the cooperative. On the basis of promoting democracy, the leadership of the cooperative was examined and improved, various problems in the cooperative were reasonably solved, and the various systems of the cooperative were further established and improved. Production plans and labor discipline were formulated to consolidate the cooperative. This fully shows that even if a cooperative is established relatively well, if the cadres become complacent and relax their leadership over it, the cooperative will definitely not be run well, and there is even a danger of collapse.

It is necessary to continuously improve the ability of cadres, especially grass-roots cadres, to understand and observe problems, so that they can first see and affirm the mainstream aspects of things, and also see the non-mainstream aspects; not only see the superficial phenomena of things, but also be able to go deeper and see the essence of things. This is an important link in preventing and overcoming blind optimism and complacency. That is to say, the Party's leading organs and leaders should take various measures to ensure that every Party member and cadre realizes that, due to the long-term and full preparation for the arrival of this agricultural cooperation upsurge, especially after criticizing and overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking within the Party, the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants is indeed very high. However, this does not mean that every peasant in every region has the same view and the same enthusiasm for cooperation. According to surveys in many places, today most of the peasants, especially most of the poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, have the greatest confidence and the greatest enthusiasm in establishing and running cooperatives; however, there are still some peasants, especially some relatively wealthy peasants, who, although they also actively demand to join the cooperatives on the surface after the arrival of the great storm of the rural socialist mass movement, and even write applications and make guarantees to the cadres again and again, their hearts are still unwilling to join the cooperatives. Moreover, even among those peasants who are willing to join the cooperatives, there are still some people who have various ideological concerns. A good Communist Party member, especially a good Party leading worker, should see all these situations, so that he will not lose confidence in progress because he only sees the non-mainstream aspects of things; at the same time, he will not become blindly optimistic and complacent because he only sees the mainstream aspects of things and does not see or is unwilling to see the difficulties and problems in the work.

According to the Party's policies and the actual situation of the local area, we should conscientiously make overall plans for cooperation, production plans, and other work plans, and formulate specific methods and steps for gradually realizing the plans. Only in this way can rural cadres clearly understand that the achievements that have been obtained now are only preliminary achievements, and there are even greater achievements waiting for them to continue to strive for; can cadres and the masses have clear goals of struggle, and after doing a good job in one stage of work, they will know what to do and how to do it in the next stage. In this case, it is easier to prevent and correct the complacency of rural cadres who are satisfied with the existing achievements. At present, the planning work in many places cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation. Generally, there are only simple cooperation plans, and production plans and other aspects of planning have not been timely determined; some places have even started the work of establishing and expanding cooperatives without even a simple cooperation plan; some places, although they have comprehensive plans centered on cooperation, were only determined by a few cadres and activists and lack a mass base. The emergence of all these phenomena is due, on the one hand, to the fact that this cooperation upsurge came very fiercely, and cadres generally lack experience in planning work, so they did not have time and could not immediately determine a relatively complete cooperation plan and other aspects of planning. This situation is completely understandable. Now, two or three months have passed, and agricultural cooperatives in most areas have developed greatly, and cadres and the masses have accumulated considerable experience. It should be said that at this time, it is completely possible and necessary to seriously make a practical and feasible comprehensive plan centered on cooperation. Doing a good job in comprehensive planning can not only enable the work of establishing and expanding cooperatives and other work to be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, prevent and reduce chaos, and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies, but also allow cadres to broaden their horizons and encourage them to continue to move forward with more beautiful prospects.

Whether the Party organizations above the county level, especially the leadership of the county Party committees, can keep up with the development of the movement plays a decisive role in the healthy progress of agricultural cooperation. It is necessary to strengthen the inspection and supervision from top to bottom, pay close attention to the progress of the movement, point out the direction of efforts for cadres and the masses at any time, and immediately guide them to continue to move forward after a task is completed, prevent the emergence of complacency, and lead them to meet new tasks. After the work of establishing and expanding cooperatives in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, was basically completed, some cadres became blindly optimistic because agricultural cooperatives had greatly developed, and they could not see the many problems that urgently needed to be solved after the establishment and expansion of cooperatives. The Shangyu County Committee of the Communist Party of China successively held a meeting of district Party committee secretaries and a meeting of key township cadres attended by district Party committee secretaries. On the basis of affirming the work achievements, they pointed out the problems that urgently needed to be solved after the establishment and expansion of cooperatives, studied the methods to solve the problems, and summarized and promoted the experience of key areas in consolidating new cooperatives and doing a good job in production and management. After the meeting, some districts and townships attached importance to the rectification and consolidation of new cooperatives, and on the premise of doing a good job in production, they combined to solve the remaining problems in the establishment and expansion of cooperatives, and promoted the active participation of new and old cooperative members in production.

The old saying goes, "Do not become arrogant upon hearing of victory," which means that people should not be proud when they hear of victory, and should not become complacent and relaxed because of victory. This is a motto that we should especially keep in mind when we are happy for victory.

    闻胜勿骄
    农业合作化的大发展，确实是大胜利，是大喜事。从八月初到十一月上旬，全国新建立了五十九万多个农业合作社，加上原有的六十五万个农业合作社，全国已有一百二十四万多个农业合作社。在短短的两个多月内，新建立了这样一大批农业合作社，扩大了原有的多数农业合作社，而且新建社一般合乎质量的要求。这一个重大的胜利，不只是鼓舞着广大农民和农村干部，而且鼓舞着全国人民更有勇气和更有信心地继续前进。
    农业合作化上取得的这一胜利固然是伟大的，但是不应该因此就骄傲自满起来。这一方面是因为许多地方的建社和扩社工作正在紧张地进行，需要我们认真地做好许多工作；而且就是在建社和扩社已经基本结束的地区，新建社和扩大了的老社中还程度不同地存在着许多遗留问题。其中除部分地区的思想发动不够充分，小部分农民入社还不是完全自愿，土地、牲畜、农具等生产资料的处理还有偏低偏高的不合理现象，少数合作社的社员成份还不够纯洁，贫农的领导优势还没有巩固地树立起来，甚至已经发生了排斥贫农的现象以外，当前最突出的是相当多的新建合作社还没有建立起一套比较合理的生产和经营管理制度，临时派工等现象还大量存在。另一方面还应看到，即使已经和即将建立起来的大批农业合作社的质量完全合乎标准，或者扩社和建社中的遗留问题都一一解决了，但一般都还是半社会主义性质的低级社，是过渡到完全社会主义性质的高级社的一种形式。而要使一个农业合作社由低级阶段发展到高级阶段，取消土地报酬，当然是很重要的；但是更重要的是必须不断地提高社员的社会主义觉悟，逐步建立起一套符合于社会主义原则的经营管理制度。在农业合作化运动的发展较为迅速的地区，目前已有不少老社提出了小社并大社和转高级社的要求；新建社则普遍要求帮助它们解决遗留问题，特别是帮助它们迅速地建立起正常的生产秩序，加强对农业科学技术工作的指导，供应它们更多更好的新式农具、化学肥料以及其他农药农械。而党和政府的绝大多数农村工作人员不但还没有办高级农业合作社的经验，而且一般都还缺乏领导大批低级合作社的经验，不懂得或不熟悉农业科学技术知识；同时农村有关的各项工作更没有紧紧地跟上去。这就说明了，不论从当前工作任务的要求上，或者从领导的经验和水平上来看，都还远不能适应变化了的农村情况。有许多新的问题正等着要解决，许多新的工作正等着要去做。
    但是，有部分农村干部认识不到这一点，他们满足于现有的成绩，产生了一种极其有害的盲目乐观和自满松懈的情绪。这些同志看见农民的社会主义积极性空前高涨，广大的农民争先恐后地报名入社，原有合作社社员的觉悟程度和积极性也比以前大为提高，到处出现了一片蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，便错误地认为农业合作化运动似乎不再需要党的领导了，不再需要做艰苦细致的工作了。因此，有些地区忽略了建社初期的思想发动工作，有的地区在生产资料的评议工作中不认真地执行互利政策，甚至利用农民要求入社的迫切心理，故意压低生产资料的价格和报酬，或者发现有不合理的地方，也不及时加以解决。特别值得提出的是，在合作化运动的发展较为迅速的地区，尤其是已经基本上实现了农业半社会主义化的地区，一部分党员、干部的盲目乐观和自满松懈情绪更为严重。有些人认为大批合作社已经建立起来了，自己应该休息一下了。有些工作组里的同志也急着请假回城市。
    这种盲目乐观和自满松懈的思想情绪，对于农业合作化运动的发展是十分有害的。河南息县朱店乡第三农业合作社的建社工作虽然作得还好，因为区、乡干部产生了骄傲自满情绪，错误地认为在合作化的高潮下建立起来的社完全是好的，即使有些缺点也不会发生问题，用不着再进行整顿巩固工作，放松了对于这个社的领导。结果在这个社转向生产的时候，由于一些问题得不到解决，社内一时造成混乱现象，社员的生产情绪突然低落。直到乡的党支部发现了上述问题，批评纠正了这种自满松懈情绪，对这个社进行了整顿，在发扬民主的基础上，检查改进了社的领导，合理地解决了社内的各种问题，进一步建立和健全了社的各项制度，制定了生产计划和劳动纪律，才把这个社巩固下来。这就充分说明了，即使一个建立得比较好的合作社，如果干部产生了自满情绪，放松了对它的领导，这个社就必定办不好，甚至还有垮台的危险。
    应该不断地提高干部、特别是基层干部认识和观察问题的能力，使他们首先看到和肯定事物的主流方面，同时也看到非主流方面的东西；不仅看见事物的表面现象，而且能够深入一步，看清事物的本质。这是防止和克服盲目乐观和自满松懈情绪的一个重要环节。这就是说，党的领导机关和领导人应当采取各种办法，务必使每个党员、干部都认识到：由于这次农业合作化高潮的到来有着长期的充分的准备，特别是在批判克服了党内的右倾保守思想以后，农民的社会主义积极性的确是很高的。但是，这并不等于说，每个地区的每个农民都对合作化有同样的看法和同样的热情。根据许多地方的调查，今天大多数的农民，特别是大多数的贫农和新老下中农，对建社和办社的信心最大，劲头最足；但是也还有一部分农民，特别是一部分较为富裕的农民，虽然在农村社会主义群众运动的大风暴到来以后，表面上也积极要求入社，甚至三番五次地向干部写申请，打保证，但是他们的内心还不愿意入社。而且就是在那些愿意入社的农民中，也还有部分人有各种不同的思想顾虑。一个好的共产党员、特别是好的党的领导工作人员，应当看见所有这些情况，才不会因为只看见事物的非主流方面的东西而丧失前进的信心；同时也不会因为只看见事物的主流方面，看不见或不愿意看见工作中的困难和问题而产生盲目乐观和自满松懈情绪。
    应该根据党的政策和当地的实际情况，认真地做好合作化的全面规划、生产规划和其他工作的规划，并且制定出逐步实现规划的具体办法和步骤。只有这样，才能使农村干部明确地了解现在已经获得的成果，仅仅是初步的成绩，摆在他们面前还有着更巨大的成果需要去继续争取；才能使干部和群众有了明确的奋斗目标，在做好一个阶段的工作之后，就知道下一阶段应当做什么和怎样做。在这种情况下，就比较容易防止和纠正农村干部满足于现有的成绩而产生的自满松懈情绪。目前不少地方的规划工作赶不上形势发展的需要，一般都只有简单的合作化规划，没有及时定出生产规划和其他方面的规划；有些地方甚至连简单的合作化规划也没有，就开始了建社和扩社工作；有些地方虽然有了以合作化为中心的全面规划，但只是少数干部和积极分子定出来的，缺乏群众基础。所有这些现象的产生，一方面是由于这次合作化高潮来得很猛，而干部一般又很缺乏规划工作的经验，因而来不及也不可能一下就定出一个较为完整的合作化规划和其他方面的规划。这种情况是完全可以理解的。现在，时间已经过去两三个月了，多数地区的农业合作社有了很大的发展，干部和群众已经积累了相当丰富的经验。应当说，在这个时候，做出一个切实可行的以合作化为中心的全面规划是完全可能的，也是必须认真地做好的。做好全面规划，不只是可以使建社扩社工作和其他工作能够有计划有步骤地进行，防止和减少忙乱现象，保证党的政策的正确执行，而且还可以让干部眼光放远大一些，用更美好的远景鼓舞着他们继续前进。
    县以上的党组织，特别是县委会的领导，能否紧紧地跟上运动的发展，对于农业合作化健康地前进起着决定性的作用。应当加强自上而下的检查和监督，密切地注意运动进行的情况，随时指出干部和群众努力的方向，当一个任务完成以后立即指导他们继续前进，防止产生自满松懈情绪，领导他们去迎接新的任务。浙江上虞县的建社和扩社工作基本结束以后，有一部分干部因为农业合作社有了大发展便盲目乐观起来，看不见建社和扩社后的许多迫切需要解决的问题。中共上虞县委会先后召开了一次区委书记会议和一次有区委书记参加的重点乡干部会议，在肯定工作成绩的基础之上，指出了建社和扩社后迫切需要解决的问题，研究了解决问题的办法，并且总结推广了重点地区巩固新社和搞好生产和经营管理的经验。会后已有部分区、乡重视了新社的整顿巩固工作，在搞好生产的前提下，结合解决了建社和扩社中的遗留问题，推动新老社社员积极地投入了生产。
    古话说“闻胜勿骄”，意思是要人们听到胜利不要骄傲，不要因为胜利而自满松懈下来。这是我们在为胜利而高兴的时候，应该特别牢记的座右铭。
