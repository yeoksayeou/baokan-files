Xinhua News Agency, Jining, December 29th: All preparations for international through transport involving China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia on the Jining-Erlian Railway are now in place.

The gauge of the Jining-Erlian Railway is slightly wider than that of other railways in China and features many new types of equipment. In order to master and become familiar with the operating techniques of wide-gauge railways and new equipment, staff at stations along the line have been engaged in a technical operation learning campaign since December 1st.

The special equipment at Jining Station, the junction of the Jining-Erlian Railway and the Beijing-Baotou Railway – the passenger car wheel changing equipment – has been installed. With this equipment, it is possible to use electricity to replace the wheels of passenger carriages. Passengers traveling between Beijing and Ulaanbaatar can travel directly to their destination in Jining without changing carriages.

Many loading and unloading machines have successively appeared in the transshipment yard responsible for the transshipment of import and export goods. The transshipment yards are brightly lit all night, and transshipment workers are constantly practicing driving giant electric cranes and steam cranes. At present, they are already able to operate independently. The Soviet-style signaling equipment at various stations along the Jining-Erlian line has been in use since December 18th and has not experienced a single accident so far. The safety and technical inspection of passenger and freight vehicles participating in the intermodal transport carried out by the staff of the Jining Vehicle Depot ended on the 22nd. The new train schedule after the implementation of intermodal transport on the Jining-Erlian line has also been completed.
