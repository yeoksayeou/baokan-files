Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The Chinese translation of "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 12, is scheduled to be released in Shanghai and Beijing on the 25th and 28th, respectively, and will be released in other major cities across the country successively.

The Chinese translation of "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 12, includes Stalin's works from April 1929 to June 1930.

During this period, the Bolshevik Party launched a total socialist offensive, mobilizing the working class and the laboring peasantry to fight for the transformation of the entire national economy on a socialist basis and to fight for the completion of the First Five-Year Plan. The Party implemented a decisive shift in policy: from a policy of restricting the exploitation tendencies of rich peasants to a policy of eliminating the rich peasant class on the basis of overall collectivization. The Party solved the most difficult historical task of the proletarian revolution after seizing power: leading millions of individual peasant households onto the path of collective farms and onto the path of socialism.

In his article "The Year of the Great Turn," Stalin evaluated 1929 as a year of great achievements on all fronts of socialist construction. He pointed out that a fundamental change had taken place in agriculture: the middle peasants had joined collective farms, the individual peasant economy was turning onto the socialist road, and the last roots of the restoration of capitalism in the country were being eliminated.

In his speech "On Some Questions of Soviet Land Policy," Stalin exposed the bourgeois and right-opportunist theories of "equilibrium," the "spontaneous flow" of socialist construction, and the "stability" of the small peasant economy, and pointed out the superiority of large-scale collective economy in agriculture. Stalin defined the essence of collective farms as a socialist economic form and demonstrated the shift from the policy of restricting and squeezing out rural capitalist elements to the policy of eliminating the rich peasant class on the basis of overall collectivization.

In works such as "Dizzy with Success" and "Reply to Comrades Collective Farmers," Stalin exposed the distortions of the Party's line on collective farm construction and prescribed ways to correct these distortions. In the article "On the Question of the Policy of Eliminating the Rich Peasant Class," he explained the essence of the policy of eliminating the rich peasant class on the basis of overall collectivization.

In his speech "On the Right Deviation in the CPSU(B)," Stalin pointed out the wavering of the partial stabilization of capitalism and the growth of factors of revolutionary upsurge in various capitalist countries, and demonstrated the necessity of intensifying the struggle against right-wing elements in communist parties of all countries. Stalin emphasized that right deviation and conciliatory attitudes towards right deviation were the main danger of this period; he exposed that right-wing capitulationists were enemies of Leninism and agents of the rich peasants; he exposed the free bourgeois and counter-revolutionary essence of the right-opportunist "theory" of the peaceful growth of rich peasants into socialism.

This volume was also translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and published by the People's Publishing House.

专栏：

    “斯大林全集”第十二卷中译本出版
    新华社二十四日讯　“斯大林全集”第十二卷中译本定二十五日和二十八日分别在上海、北京开始发行，全国其他各大城市也将先后发行。
    “斯大林全集”第十二卷中译本包括了斯大林在一九二九年四月到一九三零年六月的著作。
    这个时期，布尔什维克党展开了社会主义全线总进攻，动员了工人阶级和劳动农民群众为在社会主义基础上改造整个国民经济而斗争，为完成第一个五年计划而斗争。党在政策上实行了一个决定性的转变：从限制富农剥削趋向的政策过渡到在全盘集体化的基础上消灭富农阶级的政策。党解决了无产阶级革命在夺取政权以后最困难的历史任务：把千百万个体农户引上集体农庄的道路，引上社会主义的道路。
    斯大林在本卷“大转变的一年”一文中把一九二九年评为社会主义建设的各条战线上取得了伟大成就的一年。他指出在农业方面已经发生根本转变：中农加入集体农庄了，个体农民经济转上社会主义道路，国内恢复资本主义的最后根源已在消灭。
    斯大林在“论苏联土地政策的几个问题”的演说中，揭穿了资产阶级和右倾机会主义的“平衡”论、社会主义建设“自流”论、小农经济“稳固”论，指出了农业中的大规模集体经济的优越性。斯大林确定了集体农庄的本质是社会主义的经济形式，论证了从限制和排挤农村资本主义分子的政策向在全盘集体化的基础上消灭富农阶级的政策的转变。
    在“胜利冲昏头脑”、“答集体农庄庄员同志们”等著作中，斯大林揭穿了对党的集体农庄建设路线的歪曲行为，规定了纠正这些歪曲行为的办法。在“论消灭富农阶级的政策问题”一文中说明了在全盘集体化的基础上消灭富农阶级的政策的实质。
    在“论联共（布）党内的右倾”的演说中，斯大林指出了资本主义局部稳定的动摇和各资本主义国家革命高潮的因素的增长，论证了加紧反对各国共产党内的右倾分子的必要性。斯大林着重指出了右倾和对右倾的调和态度是这个时期的主要危险；揭穿了右倾投降主义者是列宁主义的敌人，是富农的代理人；揭露了右倾机会主义的富农和平长入社会主义“理论”的自由资产阶级反革命本质。
    这一卷还是由中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局翻译，人民出版社出版的。
