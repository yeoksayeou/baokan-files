(Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, December 21st) A grand meeting commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1905 Revolution in Russia was held at the Grand Theater in Moscow on the evening of the 20th. Representatives of the Moscow Soviet and representatives from all walks of life gathered together. More than 300 participants in the 1905 Revolution and the December armed uprising of Moscow workers also attended the meeting.

    In the center of the rostrum was a huge statue of Lenin, the leader of the 1905 Revolution, with the numbers 1905 and 1955 formed by lights on both sides. The front was filled with flowers and an honor guard stood.

    At 6:30 PM, Soviet party and government leaders and many gray-haired veterans, representatives of the participants of the 1905 Revolution, appeared on the rostrum.

    Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, proposed a moment of silence for the martyrs of the First Russian Revolution. The whole audience stood up. The commemoration began with the singing of The Internationale.

    Pospelov, one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the CPSU, delivered a report entitled "The December Armed Uprising of 1905 Was the Culmination of the First Russian Revolution." The reporter said: "Today is precisely the historically significant day – December 20th, fifty years ago – when, at the call of the Moscow Workers' Deputies Soviet under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, a political strike began, which turned into the December armed uprising. The Moscow December armed uprising was the culmination of the 1905 People's Revolution, giving the growth of revolutionary consciousness of the Russian proletariat and the entire Russian people the most profound influence." The reporter described the significance and course of the Moscow armed uprising and the heroism of the Moscow workers, pointing out the influence of the First Russian Revolution on the liberation movements in Europe and Asia. The reporter said: "The Russian Revolution of 1905-1907 was the general prologue, without which the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 would have been impossible. The martyrs of the December armed uprising did not sacrifice in vain. The revolutionary seeds deeply sown by this People's Revolution bore great fruits."

    After the report, three of the oldest members of the CPSU spoke. Andrei Ivanovich Gorchilin, a party member since 1904 and a representative of the Moscow Soviet in 1905, recalled his meeting with Lenin and his participation in the battle of Red Presnya.

    Nadezhda Nikolaevna Kolesnikova, a participant in the December Uprising, recalled the scene of Moscow in 1905. Pavel Andreevich Buryakshin described the street fighting at that time. He emphasized that the Soviet people are gloriously preserving and carrying forward revolutionary traditions.

    At the commemoration meeting, people listened attentively to the speeches of these veteran revolutionaries, responding with bursts of applause. Comrade Mikoyan warmly shook Kolesnikova's hand after her speech to express his gratitude.

    Before the closing of the commemoration meeting, people sang The Internationale loudly. The whole audience applauded for a long time. Comrade Kaganovich took the lead in congratulating the veteran Bolsheviks, and the whole audience burst into shouts of "Hurrah!"

    When the meeting was dismissed, an old comrade with white hair on the rostrum said to the participants, "I wish everyone to see a communist society." After the meeting, Kabalevsky's new opera "Nikita Vershinin" was performed. This is adapted from the novel "Armored Train." The opera depicts a section of the history of the civil war.
