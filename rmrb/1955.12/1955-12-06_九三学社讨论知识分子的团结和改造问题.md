Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The Central Standing Committee of the Jiu San Society recently held two meetings to discuss the unity and transformation of intellectuals. These two meetings were presided over by Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiu San Society. More than 30 senior intellectuals, including scientific researchers and university professors, attended the meetings.

At the meetings, everyone unanimously agreed that the Chinese Communist Party has always trusted and valued intellectuals. In the past few years, under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, intellectuals have made great progress in their political understanding and working ability, and have also made great contributions to national construction. However, the objective situation is developing rapidly. At present, the socialist transformation of agricultural cooperation and capitalist industry and commerce has entered a new stage. Therefore, intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, must further carry out ideological remoulding in order to play a greater role in the cause of national construction. The meetings made preliminary plans on how the Jiu San Society should strengthen its work in contacting the masses and strengthen its investigation and research work. Xu Deheng pointed out at the meeting that the unity and transformation of intellectuals is a very important political task, and all members of the Jiu San Society must devote themselves to this work in order to assist the Communist Party and the government in doing this important work well.

    九三学社讨论知识分子的团结和改造问题
    据新华社五日讯　九三学社中央常务委员会在最近先后召开了两次会议，讨论知识分子的团结和改造问题。这两次会议由九三学社主席许德珩主持。出席会议的有科学研究工作者和高等学校的教授等高级知识分子三十多人。
    在会上，大家一致认为，中国共产党一向信任和重视知识分子。这几年来，知识分子在共产党的教育培养下，政治认识和工作能力都有了很大进步，对国家建设也有很大的贡献。但是客观形势发展得很快，目前农业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，都进入了新阶段，因此，知识分子、尤其是高级知识分子，必须进一步进行思想改造，才能对国家建设事业发挥更大的作用。会议对九三学社如何加强联系群众工作、加强调查研究工作等问题，作出初步规划。许德珩在会议上指出，对知识分子的团结和改造是一件十分重要的政治任务，九三学社全体成员必须全力投入这一工作，以便协助共产党和政府做好这项重要的工作。
