Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 3rd -- The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee continued its discussion on the question of admitting new member states on the 2nd.

    First to speak at the meeting was a Chiang Kai-shek element. He made slanderous remarks opposing the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic and the four European People's Democracies into the United Nations.

    Representatives from New Zealand, Burma, the Philippines, Iraq, Czechoslovakia, and Brazil, in their speeches, supported the Canadian proposal. The Czechoslovak representative pointed out that the Soviet amendment gave the Canadian proposal a more precise form (the Soviet amendment listed the names of the eighteen countries applying for membership in the United Nations -- editor's note by TASS).

    The Cuban delegation distributed two amendments. One amendment suggested that the Security Council review the applications for membership in the United Nations "in accordance with the principles stipulated by the International Court of Justice" and then report to the current General Assembly. The other amendment advocated adding the names of South Korea and South Vietnam to the Soviet amendment.

    The committee will continue to discuss the question of admitting new member states on December 5th.

    联大特别政委会
    继续讨论接纳新会员国问题
    新华社据塔斯社纽约三日讯　联合国大会特别政治委员会二日继续讨论接纳新会员国问题。
    首先在会上发言的是蒋介石分子。他发表诬蔑性的言论，反对接纳蒙古人民共和国和四个欧洲人民民主国家加入联合国。
    新西兰、缅甸、菲律宾、伊拉克、捷克斯洛伐克和巴西的代表在发言中支持加拿大的提案。捷克斯洛伐克代表指出，苏联的修正案使加拿大提案具有更精确的形式（苏联修正案中列举了申请加入联合国的十八个国家的国名——塔斯社编者注）。
    古巴代表团散发了两个修正案，一个修正案建议安全理事会“按照国际法院规定的原则”审查要求加入联合国的申请书，然后向本届大会作报告。另外一个修正案主张在苏联的修正案中再列入南朝鲜和南越这两个名字。
    委员会将在十二月五日继续讨论接纳新会员国问题。
