The China Youth Art Theatre has newly rehearsed three one-act plays, "On the Dining Car," "Mother and Daughter," and "Yellow Flower Ridge," and has been touring the suburbs of Beijing. From November 26th to December 13th, they visited eighteen townships, performed more than twenty shows, and were warmly welcomed by nearly 80,000 farmers in the suburbs. After performing in the suburbs, the performance team went to the Jingxi mining area to perform for farmers in the mountainous areas.

"On the Dining Car" (author: Wu Qiong) has the theme of raising revolutionary vigilance. The story takes place on a train, with specialist students going to factories for internships, state workers, young writers experiencing life, and hidden counter-revolutionaries. A worker who likes to show off and brag reveals state secrets to spies on the dining car, but thanks to the vigilance of fellow passengers and the meticulous arrangements of public security personnel, the spies are finally unable to escape the people's net. This novel form of performance aroused great interest among the audience, who were deeply attracted by the events that took place on the dining car. When the spies were arrested, a burst of warm applause rang out from the audience. After watching the play, an old lady said to her daughter-in-law:
	"Don't talk nonsense in the future, be careful of enemy sabotage." The daughter-in-law also said: "The enemy's mind is really sharp, we must be careful everywhere." Township cadres and militiamen said after watching the play: "We must be vigilant and never talk nonsense to others!"

"Mother and Daughter" (author: Su Gengfu) is about how the lives of farmers have generally improved after joining agricultural cooperatives, but some individual members are still selfish and do not treat the agricultural cooperative as their own home. An old lady with selfish intentions stole wheat seeds from the agricultural cooperative and gave them to her eldest daughter. After her younger daughter struggled against her and the director of the cooperative helped her, she realized her mistake. When the audience saw the younger daughter take out the wheat seeds hidden by her mother, they applauded happily. One farmer said: "We must love the cooperative as our home and not make such mistakes."

"Yellow Flower Ridge" (author: Shu Hui) also portrays a sharp class struggle. Yellow Flower Ridge is the orchard of Song Ersao, a poor widow. In order to seize her orchard, the rich peasant came up with various ways to prevent her from joining the agricultural cooperative. After a struggle, Song Ersao finally joined the agricultural cooperative, and cheerful songs rang out on Yellow Flower Ridge. The content reflected in "Yellow Flower Ridge" is precisely the problem encountered by farmers in building cooperatives. During the performance, the audience seemed to be participating in this fierce class struggle in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere, and they constantly expressed their inner excitement and joy with warm applause. After watching the play, the staff of the agricultural cooperative said: "We must pay attention to the sabotage of rich peasants at all times; for those individual households who have not yet joined the cooperative, we must study where their problems lie and whether there are bad people holding them back." Another old villager said: "I haven't joined the cooperative until now because there are elderly people at home. Now that they have seen the play, they are moved. I will quickly step up efforts to mobilize them to join the cooperative." The farmers generally believe that this performance is of concrete help in expanding agricultural cooperatives; they all say that one performance of such a play solves more problems than several meetings.

Our performances in the countryside this time fully demonstrate that farmers love drama. The audience's order was very good every time. The villagers held their breath and paid attention to every word and action on the stage, and they reacted to many subtle points. Sometimes there was a burst of laughter and applause, followed by absolute silence. The audience numbered up to more than 9,000 at most, but the order on the square was still very good. Many viewers came from other villages. An old lady came to see the show from more than a dozen miles away; they said that after watching the play, they simply didn't want to leave. Once, a cold wave struck, and many villagers insisted on watching the play in the cold wind before returning home. An old villager said: "You performed really well. What you performed is not a play, it's all true stories. You have performed us all. When we watch the play, we see our own strengths and weaknesses clearly. You have also helped us solve problems that we cannot solve." They asked the drama troupe to frequently perform in the countryside for them, and they themselves are preparing to organize drama troupes to perform plays.

After the touring performance team went to the countryside, they first asked the responsible comrades of the agricultural cooperative to give a report, and then went down to visit separately. In the booming agricultural cooperativization movement and in the vivid life, the actors studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." Wherever the performance team went, the farmers were enthusiastically participating in agricultural cooperatives, and the number of farm households signing up to join the cooperatives greatly exceeded the numbers planned by the leadership. For example, Nanmofang originally planned to develop eight households this winter and spring, then revised it to fifteen households, fifty households, and one hundred and fifty households, but later the actual number of households who signed up to join the cooperative was more than three hundred. On the first day of registration in Guanyintang, two hundred and ten households braved the heavy rain to sign up to join the cooperative. Some actors had been in the theater for several years and could not get a chance to perform. They felt depressed. This time, after performing in the countryside, they were very excited to see the farmers' welcome. They performed three shows a day, and they were still very energetic. When performing in the mining area, they carried their own luggage and curtains, and had to walk at least forty miles of mountain roads a day; the earth-shaking changes in the countryside were inspiring them, making them feel no fatigue at all.

In order to cooperate with the agricultural cooperativization movement, the director and all the actors and staff participated in this rehearsal work with great enthusiasm. This time in the countryside, the villagers were able to recognize that what was performed on the stage was real life, and the actors were the villagers themselves, which shows that these three one-act plays have achieved certain results in artistic creation. When the actors' portrayal of the characters was not deep enough, the villagers offered their opinions to help the actors improve. The actors also continued to receive new inspiration when conducting individual interviews; in this way, in the process of touring performances, they absorbed nutrients from life and enriched the creation of the characters. For example, an old villager told the actor who played the rich peasant that you played very well, but the rich peasants here are even worse than you played. He bows and scrapes to the staff and pretends to be a good person, but he is very fierce when he turns his face. The actor was inspired by these words and further grasped the hypocritical and vicious essence of the rich peasant elements. For example, when the actor who played the poor widow visited the farmers, she met a former poor peasant who had worked for landlords for many years without eating a full meal, but his attitude towards life was very tenacious. However, the character created by the actor on the stage was a relatively weak poor peasant who showed more pessimism and despair when encountering difficulties, rather than actively trying to overcome the difficulties. After these visits, the actors not only more deeply understood the inner activities of the characters in the play, but also improved their own level of understanding. In the past, some people believed that the villagers' cultural level was not high enough, and that it was enough to just get the general idea of ​​watching the play, and that they could not see the subtle inner activities. This time, the performance in the countryside proved that farmers are very good at watching plays and understand plays very well; with the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, the villagers' requirements for our performances are also constantly improving. When we perform in the countryside for farmers, we should conscientiously rehearse the plays, and we must constantly listen to their opinions, learn from them, and improve the quality of our performances.

    为农民演出话剧
    孙维世
    中国青年艺术剧院新排演了三个独幕剧“在餐车上”、“母女俩”和“黄花岭”，到北京市郊区进行了巡回演出。从十一月二十六日到十二月十三日，到过十八个乡，演出了二十多场，受到郊区近八万农民热烈的欢迎。演出队在郊区演出后，又到京西矿区为山地的农民演出。
    “在餐车上”（作者吴琼）是以提高革命警惕性为主题的。故事发生在一列火车上，车上有下工厂实习的专科学生，有国家的工作人员，有去体验生活的青年作家，也有暗藏的反革命分子。有一个爱表现自己、夸夸其谈的工作人员，在餐车上把国家的机密泄露给特务，但是由于同车人的警惕和公安工作人员的严密布置，终于使特务逃不出人民的法网。这种新頴的演出形式，使观众感到很大的兴趣，他们被这个餐车上所发生的事件深深地吸引着，当特务被逮捕的时候，台下响起了一片热烈的掌声。看完戏以后，一位老大娘对她的儿媳说：
  “以后不要乱说话了，小心敌人的破坏。”儿媳也说：“敌人的心眼儿真尖，咱们处处要留神。”乡干部和民兵看完戏说：“我们要提高警惕，千万不要对人乱讲话！”
    “母女俩”（作者苏耕夫）是写农民加入农业合作社以后，生活普遍得到提高，但是还有个别社员有私心，不把农业合作社当自己的家一样看待。有一个有私心的老大娘，偷了农业合作社的麦种送给自己的大女儿，经过小女儿对她进行的斗争和社主任对她的帮助，她认识了自己的错误。当观众看到小女儿拿出母亲藏起的麦种的时候，都高兴得鼓起掌来，有个农民说：“我们要爱社如家，不能犯这样的错误。”
    “黄花岭”（作者舒慧）也表现了一场尖锐的阶级斗争。黄花岭是贫农孀妇宋二嫂的果园。富农为了霸占她的园地，想出了种种办法破坏她参加农业合作社。经过了一场斗争，宋二嫂终于参加了农业合作社，黄花岭上响起了一片愉快的歌声。“黄花岭”所反映的内容正是农民们建社中所遇到的问题。演出的时候，观众彷彿一直在紧张热烈的气氛中参与了这场激烈的阶级斗争，他们不断地用热烈的掌声来表达出内心的兴奋和喜悦。看完戏以后，农业合作社的工作人员说：“要随时注意富农的破坏；对现在还没有入社的单干户，我们一定要研究他的问题在哪儿，是不是有坏人拉腿。”另一个老乡说：“我直到现在还没入社，因为家里有老人，现在他们看了戏，心动了，我赶快就加劲动员他们入社。”农民们普遍认为这次演出对扩大农业合作社有具体帮助；都说演出一次这样的戏，比开几次会都解决问题。
    我们这次下乡的演出，充分说明了农民是喜爱话剧的。每次演出的时候，观众的秩序都很好。老乡们屏息静气地注意着台上的每一句话和每一个动作，对许多细微的地方都有反应，有时爆发一片笑声和掌声，接着又是绝对的安静，观众最多的时候达九千多人，但是广场上的秩序还是很好。许多观众都从外乡赶来，有一位老大娘从十几里以外的地方赶来看；他们说，看了话剧，简直不想走了。有一次寒流袭来，许多老乡在冷风中坚持把戏看完才回去。一个老乡说：“你们演得真好，你们演的不是戏，都是真事，你们把我们都给演出来了，我们在台下看戏，把自己的长处、短处都看清了，我们不能解决的问题，你们也帮助我们解决了。”他们要求话剧团经常下乡为他们演出，他们自己也准备组织话剧团演话剧。
    巡回演出队下乡后，每到一地区，先请农业合作社的负责同志作报告，然后下去分头访问。演员在轰轰烈烈的农业合作化运动中、在活生生的生活中，学习了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告。演出队所到的地方，农民们都在踊跃地参加农业合作社，报名入社的农户都大大超过了领导方面计划发展的数字。例如南磨坊原订今冬明春发展八户，后改订为十五户，五十户，一百五十户，可是后来实际报名入社的却有三百多户。观音堂报名的第一天，冒着大雨报名入社的就有二百一十户。有的演员到剧院好几年，老也轮不上戏演，心中有苦闷，这回下乡演出后，看到农民对他们的欢迎，心中很兴奋，一天演了三场戏，他们还劲头很大。在矿区演出的时候，他们自己背着行李和幕布，一天至少要步行四十多里山路；农村中所起的翻天覆地的变化在鼓舞着他们，使他们丝毫不觉得疲劳。
    为了配合农业合作化运动，导演和全体演员、职员是用极大的热情参加这次排演工作的。这次下乡，老乡们能够认舞台上演出的就是真实的生活，演员就是老乡们自己，就说明了这三个独幕剧在艺术创造上有一定的成绩。演员在人物的体现上还有不够深刻的地方，老乡们就提出意见来帮助演员改进，演员在进行个别访问的时候，也不断得到新的启发；这样，在巡回演出的过程中，他们从生活中吸取了养料，丰富了人物的创造。例如有一位老乡告诉演富农的演员说，你演得很好，可是我们这儿的富农，比你演的还要坏，他对工作人员都是点头哈腰地装好人，转过脸去可厉害哩。演员就从这些话中得到启示，进一步抓住了富农分子的虚伪毒辣的实质。又如演贫农孀妇的演员在访问农民的时候，见到一个过去的贫农，他曾经替地主扛了多年的活，没有吃过一顿饱饭，但是他对生活的态度却是非常顽强的。而演员在舞台上所创造的人物，却是个比较软弱的贫农，遇到了困难，就更多地表现出悲观失望的情绪，而不是积极地去想办法克服困难。经过了这些访问之后，演员不仅更深刻地体会了剧中人的内心活动，而且提高了演员自己的认识水平。过去有人认为老乡们文化水平不高，看戏只要看个大意就够了，细微的内心活动他们看不出来。这次下乡演出证明：农民是很会看戏的，而且是很懂得戏的；随着农业合作化的迅速发展，老乡们对于我们演出的要求，也随着不断地提高。我们下乡为农民演出，应该兢兢业业地排好戏，而且要在演出中不断地听取他们的意见，向他们学习，提高我们的演出质量。
