The visit of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe to Iceland has established a good beginning for promoting cultural exchange between China and Iceland. The Icelandic people cherish the friendship of their friends from afar, and they treasure souvenirs from the Chinese troupe's visit like treasures: a program, a signature, even an empty Chinese cigarette box.

During the week of the Chinese artists' visit to Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, they strongly felt the enthusiasm of the Icelandic people towards them. They encountered friendly smiles everywhere. When they walked on the street, people often came up to shake their hands and say, "Welcome to Iceland." Even people in cars stopped to wave to them. The Icelandic people consider the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe's visit to Iceland as an expression of the Chinese people's friendship towards the Icelandic people. A statement made by an Icelandic writer to the Chinese artists expressed their feelings. He said with great emotion, "Your country is so big, and our country is so small, but you still think of us and come all the way to perform your ancient cultural arts for us. We regard this as the most precious gift, and we will never forget it in our lives." An old lady, when bidding farewell to the troupe, gave a bracelet to the Chinese actress Jiang Xinrong. The old lady pointed to her heart and said, "Although we are far apart, our hearts are close. This bracelet symbolizes that our friendship will always connect us tightly together."

The performances of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe were praised by Icelandic public opinion and literary and art circles. Hjalmarsson, Iceland's most famous theater critic, said, "Peking Opera is so full of human touch that it directly enters people's hearts. People's hearts are similar to each other, no matter where they live in this vast world." Another critic, Grimsson, said that the performance of Peking Opera "unfolded before our eyes a spiritual world of a distant and important culture."

During their stay in Reykjavik, the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe watched the Icelandic National Theater's performance of the drama "The Good Soldier Svejk," the theme of which is to satirize unjust wars. The Chinese artists also visited the oil painting exhibition of the famous Icelandic painter Kjarval, who loved his country's rivers and mountains, and visited the Icelandic National Museum and the souvenirs in the museum about the life and struggle of the Icelandic national hero Sigurðsson. All of this left an unforgettable impression on the Chinese artists and made them further appreciate the Icelandic people's love for peace, freedom, and independence.

The ancient Icelandic epic "Edda" has a famous saying: "The road to the enemy is winding and long, even if his house is on the main road; the road to a friend is wide and straight, even if he lives far away." The Icelandic people warmly welcome the friendly visit of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe. From the Chinese cultural envoys who came to visit their country after traveling a long distance and crossing a vast ocean, they see that the Chinese people living far away are their most approachable and sincere friends.

    冰岛人民欢迎远道而来的中国朋友
    新华社记者　帅鹏
    中国古典歌舞剧团在冰岛的访问，为促进中国和冰岛之间的文化交流建立了一个良好的开端。冰岛人民珍视他们远方来的朋友对他们的友谊，他们像宝贝一样珍藏着中国剧团这次访问留下的纪念品：一份节目单，一个签名，甚至一个中国的空纸烟盒。
    中国艺术家们在冰岛首都雷克雅未克访问的一星期中，强烈地感到冰岛人民对他们的热情。他们处处遇到人们友好的微笑。他们在街上走的时候，时常有人走过来同他们握手说：“欢迎你来冰岛”。甚至坐在汽车里的人也停下车来向他们挥手致意。冰岛人民认为中国古典歌舞剧团访问冰岛是中国人民对冰岛人民的友谊的表现。一位冰岛作家向中国艺术家说的一番话表达了他们的心情。他十分感动地说：“你们的国家是那样大，我们的国家是这样小，但是你们还是想到我们，并且不顾路途遥远来为我们表演你们古老的文化艺术。我们把这看作最珍贵的礼物，我们一生也不会忘记。”一个老太太在向剧团告别的时候，把一个手镯送给中国演员江新蓉。老太太指着自己的心说：“我们相隔虽然远，但是我们的心是靠近的，这个镯子象征着我们的友谊永远把我们紧紧地连在一起。”
    中国古典歌舞剧团的演出受到冰岛舆论和文艺界人士的赞扬。冰岛最著名的剧评家希雅尔塔尔森说：“京剧是这样富于人情味，他直接打入了人们的心。人们的心是彼此相似的，不管他们生活在这广大的地球的什么地方。”另一个剧评家格里姆森说，京剧的演出“在我们眼前展开了一个遥远的重要的文化的精神世界。”
    中国古典歌舞剧团在雷克雅未克期间观看了冰岛国家剧院演出的话剧“好兵帅克”，这个话剧的主题是讽刺不正义的战争。中国艺术家也参观了热爱祖国河山的冰岛著名画家克雅尔瓦尔的油画展览，参观了冰岛国家博物馆和博物馆中关于冰岛民族英雄西格尔森的生活和斗争的纪念品。这一切都给中国艺术家留下了难忘的印象，使他们进一步体会到冰岛人民对和平自由和独立的热爱。
    冰岛的古代史诗“艾达”中有一句名言说：“到仇敌的路曲折又漫长，那怕他的房子就在大道上；到朋友的路宽阔而笔直，即使他居住在远方。”冰岛人民热烈地欢迎中国古典歌舞剧团的友好访问，他们从经过遥远的道路，渡过广阔的海洋来到他们国家访问的中国文化使者身上，看到居住在远方的中国人民是他们最容易接近的真诚的朋友。
