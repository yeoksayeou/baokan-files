    Do a Good Job of Supply Work to Support Agricultural Production
    Help Farmers Learn to Use New Farm Tools
    To the Editors:
    After studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the staff of the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, actively improved the supply of agricultural production materials.
    During the "Sanqiu" (Three Autumns: autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) production campaign, the supply and marketing cooperative assigned six staff members to form two supply teams, which went to four townships, including Zhangzhuang and Xichuan, to promptly supply the production materials needed by farmers. The supply teams provided timely technical guidance and repair work by inspecting farmers' use of new farm tools. In the past, the Cangshang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangzhuang Township bought a double-shared plow, but because they had not learned how to use it properly and the plow had some problems, the members said that the plow was "high in the front and low in the back, plowing unevenly and not gripping firmly," and they were unwilling to use it. The supply team repaired the double-shared plow and guided the members to learn how to use it. As a result, everyone scrambled to use it.
    The supply team also adopted the method of key demonstrations to promote new agricultural implements. For example, Beidi Township is a mountainous area, and the farmers thought that the double-wheeled, double-shared plow was "heavy and clumsy" and "too small to use here." Although the collective agricultural cooperative bought one in the past, no one used it. After the supply team and the Party branch specifically studied this situation, they used the existing double-wheeled, double-shared plow to perform plowing, and invited personnel from various agricultural cooperatives to visit. After the trial, everyone felt that the double-shared plow was not "heavy and clumsy," but "light, flat, and stable"; it was not "too small to use here," but "there are too few plows." Therefore, in five days, all agricultural cooperatives in the township bought eight double-shared plows and planned to buy four more.
    Because the supply and marketing cooperative combined supply work with production and went deep into the masses, the sales volume of new farm tools increased greatly compared with the past. For example, the Chengguan Cooperative sold 43 double-wheeled, double-shared plows, 44,000 jin of cake fertilizer, 110 dustpans and wooden forks, and more than 1,000 other small farm tools in October alone in the five townships of Chengguan, Zhangzhuang, Xichuan, Beilixin, and Beidi under its jurisdiction, completing 91 percent of the fourth quarter's supply task. In addition, they also purchased 15 head of livestock for nine cooperatives, including Hongxing and Heping, in Baodian and other places, strongly supporting farmers' production.

    Supply Production Materials According to the Needs of Farmers
    To the Editors:
    In order to support the agricultural cooperation movement and the autumn harvest and winter planting work of farmers, the Xiayang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Minhou County, Fujian Province, processed locally and purchased from outside 110,000 yuan worth of production materials and daily necessities, especially preparing production materials very adequately. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperative also organized ironworkers to repair more than 400 pieces of farm tools for farmers.
    In its supply work, the supply and marketing cooperative found that the shortage of draught cattle was a major difficulty in the production of local agricultural production cooperatives. Like the newly established Nuli and Qunxing agricultural cooperatives, they both lacked draught cattle, and they could not rent them even if they wanted to during the autumn harvest and winter planting season. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative took the initiative to apply for loans from the bank and invited some experienced farmers from the agricultural cooperatives to purchase more than a dozen draught cattle in other counties. Yan Quanmei, the director of the Nuli Agricultural Production Cooperative, was happy to say, "In the past, we had to spend 24 jin of grain to rent other people's cattle to plow one mu of land; now that the supply and marketing cooperative has helped us buy cattle, we don't have to pay rent anymore."
    Seeing that some farmers and individual agricultural cooperatives did not have threshing mats, and the grains were easily scattered during threshing, the supply and marketing cooperative sold bags of fertilizer at low prices to farmers as threshing mats. Using bags of fertilizer as threshing mats saves about two-thirds of the cost compared to using hemp cloth as threshing mats, which farmers are very satisfied with.
    In addition, the accountant of the supply and marketing cooperative, in addition to doing his daily business work, also takes the time to help nearby agricultural cooperatives establish and sort out complicated accounts. This approach has been warmly welcomed by agricultural cooperatives.

    Bring Goods Down to the Countryside
    To the Editors:
    In order to support the "Sanqiu" work, the Gucun Lianxiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, investigated the needs of 15 agricultural cooperatives and 25 mutual aid teams in the local area before the autumn harvest and purchased a large number of production materials and daily necessities. In order to facilitate farmers' buying and selling, the supply and marketing cooperative decided to assign Deputy Director Liu Baohe and six other staff members to form three delivery teams to go to the countryside to do supply work.
    At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the supply teams took more than 30 kinds of goods and went to the more remote natural villages. Whenever they arrived in a village, the supply teams not only took the initiative to contact the village cadres, but also used loudspeakers to broadcast to the farmers and conducted business during the time when the masses were eating and resting. The delivery teams went to the countryside nine times, selling a total of 119 jin of kerosene, 319 jin of salt, and many clothes, kerosene lamps, and homespun cloth, with a total sales amount of more than 500 yuan; they also purchased 60 jin of eggs, 32 jin of hemp seeds, and 12 jin of rope ends, worth a total of 35 yuan.
  This time, the delivery of goods to the countryside was welcomed by the masses. Many people said with emotion: We are worried about not having time to buy things, and they carry burdens to deliver the goods to our door. This is a supply and marketing cooperative that wholeheartedly serves us! 　Zhang Zhikong

### 做好供应工作支援农业生产

    做好供应工作支援农业生产
    帮助农民学会使用新农具编辑同志：
    山西襄垣县城关供销合作社的工作人员们学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，积极改进农业生产资料的供应工作。
    在“三秋”生产运动中，供销社抽出六个工作人员，组成了两个供应小组，分别到张庄、西川等四个乡，及时供应农民所需要的生产资料。供应小组通过检查农民使用新农具的情况，适时地进行了技术指导和修配工作。张庄乡仓上农业社过去买回了一部双铧犁，由于没有学好使用技术，再加上犁也有些毛病，社员们都说这部犁是“前犁高、后犁低，耕不平、抓不稳”，不愿意使用。供应小组就对这部双铧犁进行了修理，并且指导社员们学会了使用技术，结果大家就抢着用。
    供应小组还采取了重点示范的办法来推广新式农具。如北底乡是山区，农民都认为双轮双铧犁
  “又重又笨”，这里“地小使不上”；过去集体农业社虽然买了一部，但是也没人使用。供应小组同党支部具体研究了这种情况以后，就用现有的一部双轮双铧犁进行犁地的表演，吸收各个农业社的人员来参观。经过试用以后，大家都感到双铧犁不是“又重又笨”，而是“又轻又平稳”；这里不是“地小使不上”，而是“犁少不够用”。因此，在五天中，全乡各农业社就买了八部双铧犁，还计划再买四部。
    由于供销社结合生产，深入群众进行供应工作，新农具的销售量比过去大大增加了。像城关社在所辖城关、张庄、西川、北里信、北底五个乡，十月份一个月就推销了双轮双铧犁四十三部，饼肥四万四千斤，簸箕、木杈等一百一十件，其他小农具一千多件，完成了第四季度供应任务的百分之九十一。另外，他们还到鲍店等地给红星、和平等九个社购买了牲口十五头，有力地支持了农民的生产。

    根据农民需要供应生产资料编辑同志：
    福建闽侯县下洋区供销合作社为了支援农业合作化运动和农民秋收冬种工作，根据农民的需要，在当地加工和向外采购了价值十一万元的生产资料和生活用品，特别是生产资料准备得很充分。另外，供销社还组织铁器工人为农民修补了农具四百多件。
    供销社在供应工作中发现了耕牛不足是当地农业生产合作社生产中的一个很大的困难。像新建立的努力、群星两个农业社都缺耕牛，在秋收冬种期间要向外面租也租不到。于是，供销社就主动向银行贷款，并且请农业社里选出一些有经验的农民，一起到外县购买了十几头耕牛。努力农业生产合作社从供销社买到了耕牛解决畜力不足的困难，社长严铨梅高兴地说：“过去我们租别人的牛犁一亩田，要花二十四斤谷子；现在供销社帮我们买到牛，就不要再付租钱了。”
    供销社看到有的农民和个别农业社没有楻帐，打场的时候谷粒很容易飞散，就把装肥田粉的口袋低价卖给农民作楻帐。用装肥田粉的袋作楻帐，比起用麻布作楻帐来要节省资金三分之二左右，农民们都很满意。
    另外，供销社的会计员除了作好本身每日业务工作外，还抽出一定的时间帮助附近农业社的会计建立和整理繁杂的账目。这种做法，受到了农业社的热烈欢迎。

    把货物送下乡去编辑同志：
    山西壶关县固村联乡供销合作社为了支援“三秋”工作，在秋收前就调查了当地十五个农业社和二十五个互助组的需要，购进了大批生产资料和生活资料。为了便利农民买卖东西，供销社决定抽出副主任刘保和等六个工作人员，组成三个送货小组下乡做供应工作。
    秋收一开始，供应小组就带着三十多种商品，分头到各个较远的自然村去。每到一个村子，供应小组除了主动同村干部联系以外，还利用广播筒向农民广播，在群众吃饭和休息的时间进行营业。送货小组下乡九次，共卖出煤油一百一十九斤、食盐三百一十九斤和不少衣服、马灯、土布等，销货金额共五百多元；还收购了鸡蛋六十斤、大麻籽三十二斤和绳头十二斤，共值三十五元。
  这次下乡送货，受到了群众的欢迎。不少人感动地说：咱们正愁没时间去买东西，他们就担着担子把货送上门来了。这真是一心一意为咱服务的供销社！　张志孔
