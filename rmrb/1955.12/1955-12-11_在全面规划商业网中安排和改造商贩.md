Arranging and Transforming Peddlers in the Overall Planning of the Commercial Network
    Wang Fengting
    The 18th District of Jiaoxian County is located at the junction of Jiaoxian, Jiaonan, Zhucheng, and Gaomi counties. There are four market towns in the district, with Puji being the largest, serving as the economic center for the bordering areas of these four counties. Before the commercial network was planned, state-owned commerce had two operating groups in Puji, one for general merchandise and one for exclusive tobacco and alcohol sales, responsible for wholesale business, with the general merchandise group also handling retail sales. The supply and marketing cooperative also had three retail outlets in Puji for general merchandise, non-staple foods, and production materials, as well as a grain and oil store. In other market towns and villages, there were also seven comprehensive retail stores and a grain and oil purchasing group. There were a total of 198 private businesses, employing 223 people. Due to changes in the economic situation over the years, especially the closure or shutdown of more than 50% of the total number of private merchants last year, the commercial network has been greatly reduced. Furthermore, the uneven distribution of private merchants and the overextension of the supply and marketing cooperative's business have made it very inconvenient for farmers to buy and sell goods. Residents in some villages had to travel several miles to buy a pack of matches, two ounces of oil, or a pound of salt, and they were very dissatisfied with this situation.
    The supply and marketing cooperative's failure to engage in wholesale business made it difficult to lead the market and transform private merchants. Some rural retail stores, due to small business volume and high expenses, were neither in line with accounting principles nor conducive to the arrangement of private merchants.
    These circumstances indicate that the existing commercial network can no longer fully meet the needs of social commodity circulation and the requirements of the supply and marketing cooperative to lead and transform private merchants. Therefore, it is essential to make overall plans, gradually adjust, and rationally arrange and transform private commerce on the basis of the existing public and private commercial network.
    In order to rationally arrange and transform private merchants in the process of planning the commercial network, the 18th District Supply and Marketing Cooperative investigated the purchasing power of the masses this year and the composition of commodities, and calculated the purchasing and sales tasks that the public and private commercial sectors in the district actually needed to undertake. Then, they investigated the distribution of existing private merchants and those who had closed down last year but might resume business, and studied what organizational forms to use to transform private merchants, as well as the extent to which they could be organized. Based on the above information, and in accordance with the principles of convenience to the masses, compliance with accounting practices, and facilitation of the supply and marketing cooperative's leadership of the rural market and transformation of private merchants, an overall plan was made to adjust the public and private commercial network throughout the district, and the following adjustments were made:
    The state-owned general merchandise and exclusive tobacco and alcohol sales organizations were abolished, and their wholesale business was transferred to the specialized stores of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative and the county cooperative's wholesale organization in Puji.
    In Puji, the supply and marketing cooperative established four new specialized stores based on the original three retail outlets and one business group: cotton cloth, general merchandise, non-staple foods, production materials, and furniture, responsible for wholesale and retail business. In addition, a purchasing station for agricultural and sideline products was established. These organizations are responsible for leading and transforming private merchants respectively. The original three comprehensive retail stores located in other market towns are now only responsible for retail sales and assisting specialized stores in supervising the operation of private merchants within their respective regions.
    After the core supply and marketing cooperative commercial network was formed, the following arrangements were made for private merchants:
    Eleven consignment shops were set up in villages with about 200 households each. Each shop has one person responsible for supplying daily necessities such as tobacco, alcohol, tea, sugar, salt, matches, native paper, soap, and seasonings to the masses in their own and nearby villages.
    Four purchasing and consignment agents were set up in another three villages. They adopt a "zoning and mobile" approach, and in addition to attending markets, they regularly travel to the villages within their assigned areas to purchase small local products and waste materials, and to supply small commodities to farmers.
    There are also six specialized consignment agents. Among them, two oil delivery agents are responsible for supplying edible oil to 33 villages (because this area is a peanut-producing area, there are more households retaining oil materials than supplying oil); and one each for native tobacco, salt, groceries, and cloth scraps. These people mainly bring goods to markets, and also travel to villages between market days.
    Eight cooperative stores were organized: five general merchandise cooperative stores were established in five villages, with a total of 17 people; in addition to attending markets, they have fixed areas for traveling to villages. One cotton cloth cooperative store, with five staff members; in addition to attending markets, they are responsible for delivering goods to six villages. One seafood cooperative store, with a total of seven people; in addition to attending markets, they are responsible for delivering goods to 33 villages. One slaughter cooperative store, with a total of four people; responsible for supplying pork to two markets and slaughtering pigs for government agencies and the public for a handling fee.
    The supply and marketing cooperative and four private pharmacies jointly established a cooperative clinic, with a total of 11 people, responsible for wholesaling Chinese medicine to nearby private pharmacies and setting up clinics in three market towns and one village.
    Two cooperative restaurants, with a total of 12 people. Five operating groups, with a total of 125 people, are located in market towns along transportation routes, responsible for providing meals to markets and traveling merchants.
    One livestock exchange service center, with a total of 16 people, facilitates livestock transactions for the public in the district's markets and transports livestock and piglets between regions as needed.
    In addition, ten oil mills, one flour mill, eight tofu workshops, two pastry workshops, and four fried dough stick stalls were restored throughout the district.
    After adjusting the commercial network and arranging and transforming private merchants, there are now 263 private businesses in the district, with a total of 300 employees. At present, 196 people have been organized and transformed through consignment, cooperative stores, joint ventures, distribution, and other forms, accounting for 65.33% of the number of private merchants.
    After the transformation of small merchants and peddlers, the purchasing and sales demands of the masses have been further met. Now, 50% of the villages in the district have established commercial organizations, and about 70% of the population can buy daily necessities without leaving the village. In the designated areas, small merchants and peddlers can be seen in each village every three or two days. The masses commented: "The government and the cooperative have done another good thing for the masses"; "Selling is easy, buying is convenient."
    Small merchants and peddlers have raised their awareness and changed their business style. In the past, small merchants and peddlers only operated in goods with relatively high profits and were unwilling to operate in small, scattered goods with low profits. As a result, they often could not meet the needs of the masses in terms of commodity varieties. After the transformation, especially in the organized cooperative stores, this phenomenon almost disappeared. Most small merchants and peddlers, in addition to increasing the number of commodities from dozens to one or two hundred, or even four or five hundred, according to market needs, also collect statistics on the small agricultural tools needed by the masses when traveling to villages and purchase them on behalf of the masses. During the autumn planting season this year, some stores delivered pesticides to farmers' doors overnight. In the past, small merchants with storefronts never traveled to villages, and those who were used to attending markets were also unwilling to travel to villages. After the arrangement and transformation, a system of delivering goods to the countryside was established, with regular deliveries and purchases, and voluntary cooperation in setting up stalls in the villages. When the Miaojiazhuang General Merchandise Cooperative Store delivered goods to Fengjiagou, the masses automatically helped them set up the stalls, sweep the goods yard, and burn water to treat them, and helped load the vehicles when they left.
    The use of merchants and peddlers to go deep into the countryside to purchase small local products and waste materials also facilitated the sales of the masses. From January to August, a total of 3,974 jin of miscellaneous bones were purchased throughout the district. Last year, the cooperative posted a sign to purchase hair, but received nothing. This year, it has already purchased more than 1,470 jin. An old lady in her seventies in Yu's Village sold hair, broken sacks, broken glass, etc. five times in a row, and exchanged them for many needles, threads, and other sundries. She said happily: "Things that have been thrown away have become live money again." After the establishment of the cooperative clinic, Chinese medicine practitioners changed the idea of "doctors not knocking on doors" and took turns going to the countryside with medicines to treat the masses. The masses generally reflected: "In the past, it was not easy for us poor people to hire a doctor when we were sick! Now, not only do they come as soon as they are invited, but they also come on their own if we don't invite them. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership!"
    The income of small merchants and peddlers has also generally increased, and their lives have been guaranteed. According to the statistics of 163 pure commercial merchants and peddlers in the district, the trade volume from January to August this year increased by 29% compared with the same period last year. In the first half of 1954, the sales volume of the Miaojiazhuang General Merchandise Cooperative Store was 8,273 yuan. After being organized this year, the sales volume in the same period rose to 9,844 yuan (excluding consignment amount), an increase of 19%. Last year, they lost more than 200 yuan. In the same period this year, each person could earn 24.43 yuan per month.
    Due to the supply and marketing cooperative's development of wholesale business and the appropriate adjustment of the wholesale starting point, small merchants and peddlers have overcome the difficulties of small capital and few varieties of goods purchased. Grocery merchant Wang Shushen said: "In the past, due to the shortage of funds, when purchasing goods, I could buy this but not that, which not only delayed business but also increased expenses. Now, purchasing goods from the supply and marketing cooperative is both convenient and saves expenses." As for the organized cooperative stores, the expenses are even lower. One cooperative store spent an average of 109 yuan per month in the first half of 1954 before it was organized. In the same period this year, it only spent an average of a little more than 50 yuan per month, a decrease of 54%.
    After the arrangement and transformation of small merchants and peddlers, it has also greatly facilitated the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative. After preliminary transformation, small merchants and peddlers can generally prepare business plans on a quarterly or monthly basis and purchase goods according to the plans. In particular, cooperative stores have generally established systems for statistics, accounting, and planned reports. Through plans and reports, the supply and marketing cooperative can promptly grasp the changes in operating conditions and bring business into the orbit of the plan. Before the transformation, small merchants often failed to pay taxes on time, and there were even phenomena of tax evasion. Now, due to the increase in sales volume, the reduction in tax-exempt households and tax evasion, the tax base has been expanded and tax revenue has been guaranteed. According to the statistics of two cooperative stores (ten households), the tax amount was more than 732 yuan in the first half of 1954 before the organization. In the same period this year (after the organization), it increased to more than 3,001 yuan, an increase of more than three times. Before the transformation, the goods operated by small merchants sometimes were not sold at state-owned prices. For goods that state-owned and cooperative enterprises did not have or were temporarily out of stock, they took the opportunity to raise prices and seek exorbitant profits. Now, all private merchants in the district can sell goods in accordance with state-owned prices; for goods that the department store has no price for or the supply and marketing cooperative has no retail price for, they operate according to the price determined by the cooperative and implement clear price transactions. Many farmers said with satisfaction: "Now the prices of things in the market are the same, and buying and selling is really reassuring. Even if children are sent to buy things, they are not afraid of being taken advantage of."

    在全面规划商业网中安排和改造商贩
    王凤亭
    胶县十八区位于胶县、胶南、诸城、高密四县的交界处。区内有四个集镇，以铺集为最大，是以上四县边邻地区的经济中心。在没有规划商业网以前，国营商业在铺集设有百货、烟酒专卖两个经营组，负责开展批发业务，百货组并兼营零售。供销合作社在铺集也设有百杂货、副食品、生产资料三个零售门市部和一个粮油店；在另外的集镇和村庄，还设有七个综合性的零售店和一个粮食、油料收购组。私营商业共一百九十八户，从业人员二百二十三人。由于几年来经济情况的变化，特别是约有占总户数百分之五十以上的商贩在去年内停业、歇业，使商业网大量减少。又加上私商的分布不平衡，供销合作社的业务也忙不过来，所以，农民买卖东西很不方便。一些村庄的群众买包火柴、打二两油、买斤盐，都得跑几里路才能买到。他们对这种现象甚为不满。
    供销合作社不开展批发业务，不便于领导市场和改造私商。有些乡村的零售店因业务小、开支大，既不符合核算原则，也影响对私商的安排。
    这些情况表明，现有的商业网已经不能完全适应社会商品流转的需要，不能适应供销社领导和改造私商的要求。因此，在现有公私商业网的基础上，统盘规划，逐步地调整和合理地安排、改造私营商业，是十分必要的。
    为了在规划商业网的过程中合理安排和改造私营商贩，十八区供销合作社调查了今年群众购买力及其商品组成的情况，计算出本区公私商业实际需要负担的购销任务。接着他们又调查了现有私商和去年歇业而又可能复业的私商的分布状况，研究采用何种组织形式来改造私商，以及他们可能组织起来的程度。依据上述资料，在便利群众、符合核算、有利于供销社领导农村市场和改造私商的原则下，对调整全区公私营商业网作出了统盘规划，并且进行了以下的调整：
    撤销国营百货、烟酒专卖机构，把它们的批发业务交给基层供销社的专业商店和县社在铺集的批发机构。
    供销合作社在铺集，以原有的三个零售门市部和一个业务组为基础，新设立了棉布、百杂货、副食品、生产资料和家具业四个专业商店，负责批发并兼营零售业务。此外，还设立了农副产品采购站一处。这些机构分别负责领导和改造私商。原来设在其它集镇上的三个综合性零售店，现在只负责零售，协助专业商店监督所属地区范围内私商的经营。
    在作为核心的供销社商业网组成之后，他们就对私营商贩作如下安排：
    在全区具有二百户左右的村庄里设置了十一个代销处。每处有一个人，负责对本村和附近村庄群众供应烟酒、茶叶、糖、盐、火柴、土纸、肥皂和调料等群众日常需要的商品。
    另在三个村庄里设置代购兼代销员四人，他们采取“划区流动”的方式，除赶集外，分别在划分的村庄内定时串乡，负责收购小土产、废品和对农民供应小百货。
    还有专业代销员六人。其中送油员二人，负责三十三个村的食油供应（因该区是产花生区，留油料户多于供应户）；土烟、食盐、杂货、布头代销员各一人。这些人员主要是带货赶集，集间也串乡送货。
    组织合作商店八处：在五个村庄里设立了五处百杂货合作商店，共十七人；除赶集外，都有固定的串乡范围。棉布合作商店一处，工作人员五人；除赶集外并负责向六个村串乡送货。海产合作商店
  一处，共七人；除赶集外，负责向三十三个村串乡送货。屠宰合作商店一处，共四人；负责供应两个集的猪肉，并代机关、群众宰猪，赚取手续费。
    由供销合作社和四户私营药铺合办了合作诊疗所一处，共十一人，负责对附近私营药铺批发中药，并在三个集镇和一个村庄设立了门诊部。
    合作饭店二处，共十二人。经营小组五处，共一百二十五人，都设在交通要道的集镇，负责对集市和往来客商供应饭食。
    牲畜交流服务所一处，共十六人，在本区集市为群众成交牲畜，并根据需要作地区间的牲畜、猪子贩运。
    另外，全区还恢复了十处油坊、一处粉坊、八处豆腐坊、二处糕点作坊和四户炸油条的小铺。
    经过调整商业网、安排和改造私商以后，现在全区有私商二百六十三户，从业人员共三百人。现在已经采取代销、合作商店、合营、经销等形式组织改造的有一百九十六人，占私商人数的百分之六十五点三三。
    小商小贩经过改造以后，进一步满足了群众的购销要求。现在全区已经有百分之五十的村庄建立了商业机构，有百分之七十左右的人口不出村就能买到日常用品。在划定的地区里，每隔三两天，各村就可以看到小商贩。群众的评论是：“政府和合作社又给群众办了一件好事”；“卖的省事，买的方便”。
    小商小贩提高了觉悟，转变了经营作风。以前，小商小贩都是经营利润比较大的商品，不愿经营利润小的零星商品。这样，就常常在商品品种方面不能满足群众要求。改造以后，特别在组织起来的合作商店中，这种现象几乎没有了。大部分小商小贩除了根据市场需要，把商品由几十种增加到一、二百种，甚至四、五百种外，并且在串乡时统计群众需要的小农具，为群众代购。今年秋种的时候，有的商店连夜把农药给农民送到门上。过去，有门市的小商贩从不串乡，有赶集习惯的也不愿串乡。经过安排改造后，规定了下乡送货的制度，按期送货和收购，并且自愿配合到村摆摊。苗家庄百货合作商店到逢家沟送货，群众自动帮助他们打货摊、扫货场、烧水相待，临走时还帮助装车子。
    由于利用商贩深入农村收购小土产、废品，也便利了群众的销售。一至八月，全区共收购了杂骨三千九百七十四斤。去年，合作社挂牌收购头发，一点也没有收到，今年已经收购了一千四百七十多斤。于家庄一位七十多岁的老大娘先后卖了五次头发、破麻袋、碎玻璃等，换回了许多针线等零用品。她高兴地说：“已经丢了的东西，又变成了活钱。”合作诊疗所成立以后，中医改变了“医不扣门”的思想，都带着药品轮流下乡给群众治病。群众普遍反映说：“过去咱穷人家有了病，请个医生可不容易啦！现在不但一请就到，不请自己也来。这都是毛主席领导的好处！”
    小商小贩们的收益也普遍增加，生活有了保证。据全区一百六十三户纯商业商贩的统计，今年一至八月份的贸易额就比去年同期增加了百分之二十九。苗家庄百杂货合作商店，一九五四年上半年销货额为八千二百七十三元，今年组织起来后，在同一时期中销货额上升为九千八百四十四元（代销金额不在内），增加了百分之十九。去年，他们亏本二百多元，今年同期每人每月可收益二十四元三角。
    由于供销社开展了批发业务和适当地调整了批发起点，小商小贩们克服了资金少、进货品种少的困难。杂货商王树申说：“以前因资金短少，进货时，买到这种，买不到那种，不但耽误了作买卖，还加大了开支。现在由供销社进货，进货又方便，又节约了开支。”至于组织起来的合作商店，费用开支就更少。有一个合作商店，一九五四年上半年未组织起来以前，每月平均开支一百零九元，今年同期每月平均只开支五十元多一点，降低了百分之五十四。
    对小商小贩安排改造之后，也大大便利了供销合作社的领导。小商小贩在经过初步改造以后，一般都能按季或按月编造业务计划，并根据计划进货。特别是合作商店，一般的都建立了统计、会计、计划报表等制度。通过计划和报表等，供销合作社就可以及时掌握经营情况的变化，使业务纳入计划的轨道。未改造以前，小商贩经常不能按期纳税，甚至有偷漏税的现象。现在，由于销货额增加、免税户和偷漏税现象的减少，也就扩大了税源，保证了税收。根据两个合作商店（十户）的统计，一九五四年上半年未组织起来以前，税款额为七百三十二元多，而今年同期（组织起来以后）就增为三千零一元多，增加了三倍以上。在未改造前，小商小贩所经营的商品有时就不按国营牌价出售。对国营和合作社没有或临时脱销的商品，他们就乘机抬高价格，牟取暴利。现在，全区私商完全都能按照国营牌价售货；对百货公司没价或供销合作社没有零售价的商品，都按合作社核定的价格经营，并实行明码交易。许多农民满意地说：“现在集上的东西价钱一样，买卖真放心，就是叫小孩去买东西，也不怕吃亏了。”
