Running Co-ops Must Rely on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
Li Yan

To ensure the healthy development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, we must firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the question of *why* we must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and why we *cannot* rely on the rich middle peasants, remains incompletely resolved for some Party rural workers. As a result, when running cooperatives, they often verbally proclaim reliance on the poor and lower-middle peasants but, in practice, rely on the rich middle peasants. This phenomenon was quite prevalent in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, during last year's cooperativization movement. At that time, if you went to the countryside, you would hear praise for the rich middle peasants, saying they were "eloquent, literate, and good at accounting," that they had "good livestock, good farm tools, and good management," and that they were "easy to rely on" and "easy to lead." At the same time, you could also hear criticism of the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying they had "weak production, incompetent leadership, no grain for unified purchase, and a bottomless pit for unified sales," saying that their joining the co-ops meant: "Few oxen, no carts, infertile land, just two shoulders carrying a mouth," saying they were "difficult to rely on" and "difficult to lead." Many Party rural workers welcomed the rich middle peasants joining the co-ops, believing that more rich middle peasants would reduce the co-ops' difficulties. They worried when they heard that poor and lower-middle peasants were joining the co-ops, thinking that more poor and lower-middle peasants would increase the co-ops' burden. Many Party township branches, and even Party district committees, when some co-ops with greater financial difficulties requested state assistance, often replied: "Why not absorb a few more rich middle peasant households?" As a result, in last year's cooperativization movement, the situation of rich middle peasants and poor peasants forming separate co-ops was quite serious, and co-ops dominated by rich middle peasants appeared in large numbers. Among the 2,182 newly established co-ops, 407 were dominated by rich middle peasants, and 54 co-ops even consisted entirely of middle peasants, without a single poor peasant household. If it were true that rich middle peasants were "easy to rely on" and "easy to lead," then these co-ops should have had the fewest problems and been the easiest to consolidate. However, the facts led to the exact opposite conclusion. Co-ops dominated by rich middle peasants and those composed entirely of middle peasants were precisely the ones with the most complex and difficult-to-solve problems; they were precisely the ones that were not easy to consolidate but very easy to collapse. All the cadres who participated in this year's co-op rectification work have the deepest understanding of this point. Of the 407 co-ops dominated by rich middle peasants, 158 collapsed, and another 116 were consolidated only after thorough rectification and changes in the leadership composition. Of the 54 co-ops composed entirely of middle peasants, 46 collapsed, and the eight co-ops that are barely surviving now cannot avoid collapse unless they are merged or reorganized. What is the reason for this? Let's look at the facts.

    In Chahar Village, Chahar Township, there was a ten-household co-op, of which nine households were rich middle peasants and one was a poor peasant. Because these nine rich middle peasant households all wanted to take advantage of others and feared suffering losses themselves, disputes frequently arose over the issue of "mutual benefit." Even after the district committee secretary personally went to rectify the situation, it remained unresolved, and finally, they had to announce the dissolution of the co-op. On the day the co-op disbanded, the nine rich middle peasant households were very happy. They said: "Individual farming provides food and clothing, why bother joining a co-op and looking for trouble?" But the poor peasant household wept to the district committee secretary, saying: "I lack livestock and farm tools, and I only have nine mu of land. I originally hoped to turn my life around by joining the co-op, but who knew that the co-op would collapse again? What am I going to do?" The fact that these nine rich middle peasant households were happy about the co-op's collapse, while this one poor peasant household was saddened by the co-op's collapse, is it not a good illustration of why co-ops dominated by rich middle peasants are easy to collapse and difficult to consolidate?

    Some rich middle peasants not only are unwilling to take the socialist road themselves, but they even intentionally try to ruin the cooperatives, to prove that the socialist road cannot be taken. For example, in the Second Co-op of Zhao Village, Yangjiangzhuang Township, eight of the sixteen households were old rich middle peasants, and the co-op director and accountant were among them. Instead of trying to run the co-op well, they tried to ruin it. The co-op director and accountant were, of course, "three-able" individuals who were "eloquent, literate, and good at accounting." But it was this "able" accountant who recorded eight workdays as ten workdays, and ten workdays as eight workdays, intentionally provoking dissatisfaction among the members and creating chaos in the co-op. When the co-op was in this state, the eloquent director said: "People say the socialist road is good, that's right, we'll take the socialist road. But, you see, the socialist road is good, but we just can't take it." Isn't what this director and this accountant did enough to illustrate the resistance of some rich middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas to cooperativization? If we rely on them to run co-ops, how can the co-ops be consolidated?

    Of course, some cooperatives dominated by rich middle peasants have also been consolidated, and have even increased production. Then, does this mean that these co-ops have no problems? No, some of these co-ops still have many problems, and they are very serious. First of all, some co-ops dominated by rich middle peasants openly resist the state's grain unified purchase work. For example, Zhengzhuangzi Village, Zhengzhuangzi Township, has a total of three co-ops. The first and second co-ops are dominated by poor peasants, and the third co-op is dominated by rich middle peasants. When the village's grain unified purchase work began, the first and second co-ops estimated the yields in one morning, and mobilized the members to thresh the grain overnight, quickly selling all the grain that should be sold to the state. But the third co-op used various methods of concealment and deception to try to sell less grain to the state. The grain work team had to take measures to mobilize the poor peasants of this co-op individually to expose the true situation, and personally go to the fields to check the number of crop plants. Six cadres spent twenty-two days to accurately calculate the yield. It turned out that the third co-op had concealed nearly a quarter of the actual yield. It is conceivable that if we rely on rich middle peasants to run co-ops, can the state's grain unified purchase task be completed smoothly?

    Secondly, many cooperatives dominated by rich middle peasants have generally experienced the phenomenon of not obeying the state's crop planting plan. For example, the co-op controlled by rich middle peasants in Koujiazhai Village, Zuojiawu Township, was like this. This co-op has a total of twenty-one households, and rich middle peasants account for twelve households. During this year's spring plowing season, the state assigned the co-op a cotton planting task of nineteen mu, and at the same time required a yield of one hundred jin per mu. The co-op did plant cotton in nineteen mu of land, but they did not plant all cotton. Instead, they planted one row of sweet potatoes and one row of cotton, paying attention only to managing sweet potatoes and not paying attention to managing cotton. As a result, the average yield of sweet potatoes per mu exceeded nearly one-third of the village's yield, while the average yield of cotton per mu was two-thirds lower than the village's yield. The director of this co-op also said triumphantly: "If the cotton doesn't grow well, that's the state's problem, if the sweet potatoes grow well, that's our own." It is conceivable that if we rely on rich middle peasants to run co-ops, what guarantee will there be for the implementation of the state's production plan?

    Finally, the conservative thinking of rich middle peasants in farming technology is even more entrenched, and they are not easy to accept agricultural technology innovations. The situation of two production teams of the First Co-op of Zhaizi Village, Hancheng Township, planting beans in two different ways can illustrate this problem. During this year's spring sowing season, the management committee of the co-op decided, based on the decision of the branch, that when each production team sowed beans, they should change from cluster sowing to row sowing. Most of the members of the first production team are poor peasants, and the captain is also a poor peasant. They implemented the decision of the management committee, and all the beans were sown in rows. However, most of the members of the second production team are middle peasants, and the captain is also a middle peasant. They did not implement the decision of the management committee, and all the beans were still sown in clusters. Moreover, this production team captain also spread dissatisfaction with this technological innovation among the members, saying: "Nonsense, I've been planting beans for decades, and I haven't heard of any row sowing. It still produces just as much." What was the result? The amount of fertilizer applied and the field management of the two teams were exactly the same, but the average yield of beans per mu of the second production team was forty-nine jin less than that of the first production team. It is conceivable that if we rely on rich middle peasants to run co-ops, won't agricultural technology innovation only slow down and not speed up?

    The facts are so clear that in the cooperativization movement, if we rely on rich middle peasants, we can only rely on them to develop capitalism in reality, and we cannot rely on them to build socialism. Are the rich middle peasants' "good livestock, good farm tools, and good management" good or not? Indeed, they are very good, and running cooperatives does require these "three goods." But there is a premise here, that is, we must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to unite them, lead them to correctly play the "three goods" role, and make these "three goods" serve the socialist transformation, not serve the spontaneous forces of capitalism. Facts have also proved that in all the cooperatives that have relied on the poor peasants and united the middle peasants, the "three goods" of the rich middle peasants will become an important force for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Then, what is the situation of the poor and lower-middle peasants running co-ops over the past year? The facts have made a completely positive conclusion that all the co-ops that are dominated by poor and lower-middle peasants or whose members are all poor and lower-middle peasants are co-ops with fewer problems, and if problems arise, they are easier to solve, and they are easy to consolidate. Among the co-ops established in Fengrun County last year, 391 co-ops had most of their members as poor peasants, a small portion as lower-middle peasants, and not a single rich middle peasant household. In the past year, only 42 collapsed, and 23 of them collapsed because the leadership did not provide support or even announced their dissolution. The remaining 349 co-ops did encounter many difficulties, but these difficulties did not scare them. If they lacked livestock, they used manpower to replace them; if they lacked funds, they sold women's jewelry and ancestral offerings; if some members did not have enough rations, they tried to adjust them among the members; if they did not know how to run the co-op, they learned while running it. These co-ops persisted under the leadership of the Party, and they were well-run. Almost every co-op increased production and every household increased income, becoming a living example that poor peasants can definitely run the co-op well, and running the co-op well must rely on the poor peasants. We will only cite the First Co-op of Hexi Village, Hancheng Township, as an example. This co-op originally had 46 households, including 36 poor peasants, 6 lower-middle peasants, and 4 rich middle peasants. The director who led this co-op was also a poor peasant. Except for the four rich middle peasant households, the remaining 42 households were almost the poorest households in the village. Before the Spring Festival, 19 households lacked rations. At this time, the co-op was indeed very difficult, both to solve the difficulties in production and to ensure that households lacking grain had food to eat. The four rich middle peasant households saw this situation, feared that they would suffer losses, and resolutely demanded to withdraw from the co-op. In this way, this co-op became an out-and-out "pauper co-op." On the very day that the rich middle peasants withdrew from the co-op, everyone expressed: "When other people withdraw from the co-op, they can pull carts and lead oxen. When we withdraw from the co-op, we can't even take a cow hair with us. We must resolutely not withdraw from the co-op. We must be rich in the co-op, poor in the co-op, and die in the co-op!" The difficulties became more and more serious. There was a shortage of seeds for sowing and a shortage of manure for fertilizing. At first, it was only that people had no food to eat, and later livestock also had no grass to eat. A month before the wheat harvest, the number of households lacking grain increased to 27. A few days before the wheat harvest, the number of households lacking grain increased to 37. All these difficulties were overcome by everyone's unity and by the director's day and night concerns. Unexpectedly, during the autumn harvest, the director became seriously ill and was bedridden. The township's branch secretary was worried that if the director was ill, the co-op would have problems, so he went to the co-op to check and help. To his surprise, the co-op's labor enthusiasm was extremely high and the production order was extremely good. The members expressed to the branch secretary: "We will not miss a single ear of grain in the field, and we will not miss a single grain in the threshing ground, and we will guarantee the completion of the autumn harvest task." After the autumn harvest distribution, the income of the entire co-op increased greatly. Originally, there were 19 households that were chronically short of grain, and now only six households were partially short of grain. Originally, the households lacking grain in this co-op had to be supplied with more than 11,000 jin of grain by the state. Now, in addition to the six households that were partially short of grain being solved by internal adjustment within the co-op, they can also sell more than 11,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    Facts have proved that the reason why poor and lower-middle peasants are poor is by no means because they are "weak in production," but because the small-peasant economy makes it impossible for them to escape poverty. Once organized, they will unleash endless potential in production. Facts have also proved that poor peasants are by no means "incompetent in leadership," but only because they have no opportunity to train, which makes their talents buried. As long as the burden of cooperativization is placed on their shoulders, they will show outstanding leadership talents. Facts have also proved that poor peasants are by no means "no grain for unified purchase, a bottomless pit for unified sales." As long as they are organized, poor peasants will definitely become surplus grain households from grain-deficient households. Not only do they not need state supplies, but they can also use the fruits of their labor to support the country's socialist construction. Facts have also proved that although poor peasants "lack oxen, lack carts, and have infertile land," they will never increase the burden of the co-op with their two hardworking hands and a strong heart to take the socialist road. On the contrary, they will create more wealth for the co-op. Facts have further proved that poor peasants, precisely because they are poor, are truly "poor in material but not in spirit," and truly have the greatest enthusiasm for taking the socialist road. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "For them, there is no other way out except socialism." Therefore, they are the backbone of the cooperative, and they are the leading force of the cooperative. Therefore, cooperativization must rely on them.

    Practice is the standard for testing truth. Indeed, after the test of a year of cooperativization movement practice, the truth that we must rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperativization movement has become particularly brilliant. The class line education received by the cadres at all levels in Fengrun County in this practical test is so profound and rich, vivid and powerful. This makes it easier for them to understand the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) Resolution of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." Therefore, this year's leadership of the cooperativization movement has made great progress and improvement. The vast majority of cadres have understood the importance of class analysis in the establishment and rectification of co-ops, used the method of class ranking, and implemented the Party's class line. In this year's cooperativization movement, the phenomenon of middle peasants and poor peasants building co-ops separately has been eliminated, and the phenomenon of middle peasants dominating the leadership of the co-op has also been basically overcome. Among the 8,655 members of the management committees of 577 cooperatives, 4,846 are poor peasants, 3,029 are lower-middle peasants, and only 780 are upper-middle peasants.

    Countless experiences have proved that only by tightly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants can we consolidate and unite the upper-middle peasants. Only by relying on the poor peasants and uniting the middle peasants can we gradually restrict and eliminate the rich peasants, and enable all laboring peasants to embark on the road of common prosperity, and realize the Party's socialist transformation of agriculture.

    办社必须依靠贫农和下中农
    黎言
    为了保证农业合作化运动健康的发展，必须坚决地依靠贫农和下中农。可是，究竟为什么要依靠贫农和下中农，为什么不能依靠富裕中农，这对某些党的农村工作人员来说，还是一个没有完全解决的疑问。因此，他们在办合作社的时候，往往在口头上喊的是依靠贫农和下中农，实际上作的却是依靠富裕中农。这种现象，在河北省丰润县去年的合作化运动中是相当普遍的。当时，你要走到农村，就会听到对富裕中农的称赞，说他们“能说、能写、能算”，说他们“牲畜好、农具好、经营好”，说他们“好依靠”“好领导”。同时，也可以听到对贫农和下中农的贬责，说他们“生产无力、领导无能、统购无粮、统销无底”，说他们入社是：“少牛没车地不肥，两肩只抬一张嘴”，说他们“不好依靠”，“不好领导”。有不少党的农村工作人员，一听说富裕中农入社，就十分欢迎，认为富裕中农多了，社就减少了困难；一听说贫农和下中农入社，就有点发愁，认为贫农和下中农多了，社就增加了负担。也有不少党的乡支部，甚至党的区委会，当一些资金困难较多的社请求国家帮助的时候，他们的回答往往是：“为什么不多吸收几户富裕中农？”结果，在去年的合作化运动中，富裕中农和贫农分别建社的情况相当严重，富裕中农占领导优势的社大量出现。在二千一百八十二个新建社中，富裕中农占领导优势的社就有四百零七个，而且还有五十四个社的成员全部是中农，没有一户贫农。如果说富裕中农“好依靠”
  “好领导”的话，这些社该是问题最少巩固最容易的社了，可是事实却作了完全相反的结论。凡是富裕中农占领导优势的社和清一色是中农的社，恰恰是问题最复杂、也最难解决的社，恰恰是巩固不很容易垮台却很容易的社。所有参加过今年整社工作的干部，对这一点有最深切的体会。在富裕中农占领导优势的四百零七个社中，就垮了一百五十八个，还有一百一十六个是经过彻底整顿改变了领导成分以后才巩固下来的。在清一色是中农的五十四个社中，垮了的就有四十六个，现在勉强维持下来的八个社，有的要不合并和改组还不能避免垮台。这是什么原因呢？请看事实。
    岔河乡的岔河村有一个十户的社，其中九户是富裕中农，一户是贫农。由于这九户富裕中农都想占别人的便宜，又怕自己吃亏，因而在“互利”问题上经常发生纠纷，区委书记亲自去整顿仍然不能解决，最后只好宣布解散。散社的那天，九户富裕中农十分高兴，他们说：“单干有吃又有穿，何必入社找麻烦”。而那户贫农却向区委书记直掉泪，他说：“我少牲口，缺农具，只有九亩地，原指望入社翻翻身，谁知道社又垮了，我怎么办呢？”这九户富裕中农为社垮而高兴和这一户贫农为社垮而伤心的事实，不正是对富裕中农占领导优势的社垮台容易巩固难的很好说明吗？
    有些富裕中农还不仅仅自己不愿走社会主义道路，他们甚至有意要把合作社弄垮，来证明社会主义道路是不能走的。比如杨匠庄乡赵庄第二社，十六户中有八户老富裕中农，社主任和会计都是他们，他们不是设法把社办好，而是搞垮。这个社的主任和会计，当然都是“能说、能写、能算”的“三能”者，而就是这个“能算”的会计把作了八个工的记成十个工，把作了十个工的又记成八个工，故意挑起社员的不满，造成社的混乱，而当社处在这种境地的时候，这个能说的主任就说了：“人家说社会主义道路好，对，咱就走社会主义道路，可是，你们看，社会主义道路好是好，就是咱们走不了。”这个主任和这个会计的所作所为，还不足以说明某些资本主义思想严重的富裕中农对合作化的抗拒吗？我们要是依靠他们办社，社怎么能够巩固呢？
    当然，有些富裕中农占领导优势的合作社也巩固下来了，甚至也增加了生产。那末，是不是这些社就没有问题了呢？不，其中有些社的问题还很多，而且很严重。首先，有些富裕中农占领导优势的社公开地对国家的粮食统购工作进行抵抗。比如郑庄子乡郑庄子村共有三个社，第一社和第二社是贫农占领导优势，第三社是富裕中农占领导优势。当村里的粮食统购工作开始以后，第一社和第二社用一个上午就估实了产量，并发动社员连夜赶打，很快就把应该卖给国家的粮食全部卖给了国家。而第三社却用种种隐瞒和欺骗的办法，企图少卖给国家粮食。粮食工作组只得一方面采取个别发动这个社的贫农的办法，揭露真实情况，另一方面亲自下地检查作物株数，六个干部花了二十二天的时间，才把产量算实。原来第三社隐瞒了的产量相近实产量的四分之一。可以想像，我们要是依靠富裕中农办社，国家的粮食统购任务能够顺利完成吗？
    其次，不少富裕中农占领导优势的合作社普遍发生了不服从国家作物种植计划的现象。比如左家坞乡扣家寨村被富裕中农掌权的社就是这样。这个社共二十一户，富裕中农就占了十二户。今年春耕的时候，国家分配给这个社的植棉任务是十九亩，同时要求每亩产量达到一百斤。这个社的确在十九亩地里种了棉花，但他们种的不全是棉花，而是一垅白薯，一垅棉花，只注意经营白薯，不注意经营棉花。结果，白薯每亩平均产量超过村里产量的近三分之一，而棉花每亩平均产量却比村里产量低了三分之二。这个社主任还得意地说：“棉花长不好，那是国家的，白薯长得好，这是自己的。”可以想像，我们要是依靠富裕中农办社，国家的生产计划的实现会有什么保证吗？
    最后，富裕中农在耕作技术上的保守思想是更加牢固的，他们对农业技术革新是不容易接受的。韩城镇寨子村第一社两个生产队两种播种豆子的情况就可以说明这个问题。今年春播时节，这个社的管理委员会根据支部的决定要各个生产队播种豆子的时候改簇播为条播。第一生产队的队员多数是贫农，队长也是贫农，他们执行了管理委员会的决定，全部豆子实行了条播。而第二生产队的队员多数是中农，队长也是中农，却没有执行管理委员会的决定，全部豆子照样还是簇播。而且这个生产队长还在队员中间散布对这种技术革新的不满，他说：“扯蛋，我种豆子种了几十年，还没听说过什么条播，照样没少产。”结果怎样呢？两个队的施肥数量、田间管理完全一样，第二生产队豆子的每亩平均产量比第一生产队的少收了四十九斤。可以想像，我们要是依靠富裕中农办社，农业的技术革新不是只会放慢不会加快吗？
    事实是这样清楚，在合作化运动中，我们要是依靠富裕中农的话，实际上只能依靠他们去发展资本主义，而不可能依靠他们建设社会主义。富裕中农的“牲畜好、农具好、经营好”好不好呢？的确很好，办合作社也的确需要这种“三好”。但这里有一个前提，就是要依靠贫农和下中农去团结他们，领导他们正确地发挥“三好”作用，要这种“三好”为社会主义改造服务，而不是为资本主义自发势力服务。事实也证明，凡是依靠了贫农又团结了中农的合作社，富裕中农的“三好”就会变成农业社会主义改造的重要力量。
    那末，一年来贫农和下中农办社的情况怎样呢？事实作了完全肯定的结论，凡是贫农和下中农占领导优势的社或者成员全部是贫农和下中农的社，都是问题比较少、有了问题也好解决的社，都是容易巩固的社。丰润县去年建立的社中，有三百九十一个社的成员大部分是贫农，小部分是下中农，没有一户富裕中农。一年来只垮了四十二个，而其中的二十三个是由于领导上不给支持甚至宣布解散才垮的。剩下的三百四十九个社，的确遇到了很多困难，但这些困难没有吓倒他们。缺少牲口，他们就用人力来代替；缺少资金，他们就卖掉妇女的首饰，卖掉祭祖的供器；有的社员口粮不够，他们就在社员中设法调剂；不会办社，他们就在办的中间学习。这些社在党的领导下都坚持下来了，而且办好了，几乎是社社增加了生产，户户增加了收入，成为贫农一定能够把社办好，办好必须依靠贫农的活的榜样。我们只举韩城镇河西村第一社来作一个例子。这个社原来共四十六户，其中贫农三十六户，下中农六户，富裕中农四户，领导这个社的主任也是贫农。除过四户富裕中农，其余四十二户几乎是村里的贫穷户。春节还没过，就有十九户缺少口粮。这时，社里的确很困难，既要解决生产上的困难，又要保证缺粮户有粮食吃。四户富裕中农看到这种情况，害怕自己吃亏，就坚决要求退社了。这样一来，这个社就变成了不折不扣的“穷棒子社”。就在富裕中农退社的当天，大家表示：“人家退社能拉车能牵牛，咱们退社连根牛毛也带不走；咱们可坚决不能退社，咱们要富在社里富，穷在社里穷，死在社里死！”困难越来越大了，播种缺种，上粪缺粪，开始只是人没粮吃，以后牲畜也没草吃了。麦收前一个月缺粮户增加到二十七户，麦收前几天，缺粮户增加到三十七户。所有这些困难，凭着大家的团结一致，凭着主任的日夜操心，终于克服了。谁料到，正在秋收的时候，主任得了重病，卧床不起，镇上的支部书记耽心主任病了，这个社会出问题，就到社里去检查和帮助。出乎他的意外，社里的劳动热情极高，生产秩序极好。社员们向支部书记表示：“我们要‘地不丢穗，场不丢粒’，保证完成秋收任务。”经过秋收分配，全社收入大大增加。原来有十九户常年缺粮户，现在只剩六户部分缺粮户。原来这个社的缺粮户要国家供应一万一千多斤粮食，现在除六户部分缺粮户由社内调剂解决而外，还可卖给国家一万一千多斤余粮。
    事实证明，贫农和下中农所以贫困，绝不是因为“生产无力”，而是小农经济使他们无法摆脱贫困，一旦组织起来，他们就会在生产上发挥无尽的潜力。事实也证明，贫农绝不是“领导无能”，只是由于没有锻炼的机会，使他们的才能被埋没着，只要把合作化的担子放在他们的肩上，他们就会显示出出色的领导才干来。事实也证明，贫农绝不是“统购无粮，统销无底”，只要组织起来，贫农就一定会由缺粮户变成余粮户，不但不要国家供应，还可以用自己劳动的果实，支援国家的社会主义建设。事实还证明，贫农虽然“少牛没车地不肥”，但是凭着他们两只勤劳的手和一颗走社会主义道路的坚强的心，绝不会增加社的负担，反而会给社创造更多的财富。事实更证明，贫农正因为贫困，才真正是“人穷志不穷”，才真正具有走社会主义道路的最大积极性，正像毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指出的：“对于他们说来，除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”因此，他们才是合作社的中坚骨干，他们才是合作社的领导力量。因此，合作化必须依靠他们。
    实践是检验真理的标准。的确，经过一年来合作化运动实践的检验，在合作化运动中必须依靠贫农和下中农这一真理已经显得格外光辉。丰润县的各级干部在这一实践的检验中，受到的阶级路线的教育，是这样深刻和丰富，生动和有力。这就使他们更容易领会党的七届六中全会（扩大）决议和毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”报告的精神，因此今年对合作化运动的领导就有了很大的进步和提高。绝大部分干部在建社和整社中都已懂得了阶级分析的重要，运用了阶级排队的方法，贯彻执行了党的阶级路线。在今年的合作化运动中，已经消除了中农贫农分别建社的现象，也基本上克服了中农占社的领导优势的现象，在五百七十七个合作社的八千六百五十五名社务管理委员会的委员中，贫农占四千八百四十六名，下中农占三千零二十九名，上中农只占七百八十名。
    无数经验证明，只有紧紧地依靠了贫农和下中农，才能巩固地团结上中农，只有既依靠了贫农，又团结了中农，才能逐步限制和消灭富农，也才能使全体劳动农民走上共同富裕的道路，实现党对农业的社会主义改造。
