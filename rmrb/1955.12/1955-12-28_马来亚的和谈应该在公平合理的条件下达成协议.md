    The Malayan Talks Should Reach an Agreement Under Fair and Reasonable Conditions
    Jin Zhang
    According to reports, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, and the General Secretary of the Malayan Communist Party, Chen Ping, will hold talks in northern Malaya on December 28, 1955. This peace talk, which has been brewing for nearly a year, has finally materialized. Not only do the people of Malaya place sincere expectations on this meeting between Rahman and Chen Ping, but peace-loving people all over the world are also watching its development with concern, hoping that it can reach an agreement under fair and reasonable conditions and realize peace and independence in Malaya as soon as possible.

    As everyone knows, the war in Malaya was imposed on the Malayan people by British colonialists. This war has been going on for more than seven years. For seven years, under the "Emergency Regulations," the Malayan people have been deprived of all democracy and freedom, and their lives and property have suffered significant losses. Therefore, they eagerly hope to end the war, abolish the "Emergency Regulations," and realize Malaya's independence, democracy, and peace as soon as possible. In accordance with the wishes of the Malayan people, the Malayan Communist Party has repeatedly issued statements since 1951, advocating for direct negotiations between the warring parties to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire and a satisfactory resolution of all issues related to the abolition of the "Emergency Regulations" and the peaceful realization of Malayan independence. This proposal by the Malayan Communist Party was warmly welcomed and supported by the Malayan people, but a handful of colonialists, disregarding the wishes of the Malayan people, repeatedly and resolutely rejected it, even issuing a statement in May of this year stating that they had "no intention of negotiating with the communists." However, the Malayan people's call for peace and independence did not subside because of this, but instead became increasingly widespread and resounding. Various Malayan parties and organizations have also continuously criticized the colonialists' attitude of rejecting peace talks, believing that "since the government is unable to end the war, it should accept the MCP's peace talk proposal." They also pointed out that only by recognizing the legal status of the Malayan Communist Party is it a realistic way to solve the problem. Under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the Malayan authorities had no choice but to announce a so-called "amnesty" statement; but the purpose of this "amnesty" statement was not to seek a reasonable end to the war, but simply a trick to force the other party to surrender. Regarding this point, the Malayan Communist Party also pointed out: "The method of ending the war proposed in this statement is unreasonable and unrealistic."

    Due to increased pressure from the people, the Malayan authorities finally sent representatives to arrange a meeting between Rahman and Chen Ping with the MCP. Since October, representatives from both sides have made four contacts. However, during this period, the colonialists continued to use all kinds of tricks to obstruct and sabotage. In late November, shortly after the second contact between the representatives of the two sides, the colonialists mobilized a large number of troops to launch a full-scale attack on the Malayan National Liberation Army. It is very clear that the colonialists did this for only one purpose: to try their best to prevent the talks from being realized; even if they are realized, they cannot reach a unanimous agreement. In this way, it would be good for them to continue the war, station troops in Malaya for a long time, and maintain their colonial rule in Malaya. From this, it can be seen that the Malayan people's struggle to realize peace, democracy and independence is a difficult and sharp struggle. However, as everyone knows, the power of the people is the truly great power. Whoever truly represents the broad masses of the people will receive the support and support of the broad masses of the people, and will also achieve the final victory.

    Experience has proved that peace talks must be conducted on a fair and reasonable basis in order to reach a unanimous agreement acceptable to both parties; any attempt to subdue one party by the other is destined to fail. If this meeting fails to reach a reasonable agreement, not only will the Malayan people continue to suffer the pain of war, but the British people will also suffer the same harm. We believe that the Malayan people and the British people will not allow the Malayan war to continue.

    At present, peace-loving people all over the world are paying close attention to the development of the Malayan situation, and are looking forward to the early realization of peace, democracy and independence in Malaya. However, on the eve of the meeting between Rahman and Chen Ping, a certain foreign news agency even issued the myth that "Chen Ping represents Communist China." This is undoubtedly another vicious conspiracy by the colonialists, attempting to sabotage the peace talks in this way. It must be pointed out that any conspiracy or trick of the colonialists will be seen through by the righteous eyes of the people all over the world.

    The Malayan people's struggle for independence, democracy and peace is the Malayan people's own cause. However, their struggle is by no means isolated, but will receive the concern and support of the people of Asia and the world. The Chinese people have always not interfered in the internal affairs of other countries. Like the people of Asia and the world, the Chinese people have always loved peace, have always advocated national self-determination, and have always opposed colonialism. We have always had deep sympathy for the Malayan people's struggle for independence, democracy and peace. We hope that the two sides of the Malayan peace talks will be able to see through the tricks of the colonialists, not be sabotaged by them, and be able to reach an agreement under fair and reasonable conditions, and turn Malaya from a colony into an independent, democratic and peaceful country.

    马来亚的和谈应该在公平合理的条件下达成协议
    今章
    据报道，马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼同马来亚共产党总书记陈平，将于一九五五年十二月二十八日在马来亚北部举行会谈。这个酝酿了将近一年的和平会谈，终于实现了。对于拉赫曼同陈平的这次会谈，不仅马来亚人民寄予衷心的期待，就是全世界爱好和平的人民也都以关切的心情注视着它的发展，期望它能在公平合理的条件下达成协议，早日实现马来亚的和平和独立。
    大家知道，马来亚的战争，是英国殖民主义者强加于马来亚人民身上的。这个战争已经进行了七年多。七年来，马来亚人民在“紧急条例”下，被剥夺了一切民主和自由，人命和财产也遭受了重大的损失。因此，他们热切期望结束战争，废除“紧急条例”，尽快实现马来亚的独立、民主与和平。马来亚共产党根据马来亚人民的愿望，自一九五一年以来，就一再发表声明，主张通过作战双方的直接谈判，实现全面停火和圆满解决有关废除“紧急条例”、和平实现马来亚独立的各项问题。马来亚共产党的这种建议，曾经得到马来亚人民的热烈欢迎和拥护，但一小撮殖民主义者却不顾马来亚人民的愿望，竟一再断然加以拒绝，直到今年五月间还发表声明，表示“无意同共产党进行谈判”。可是，马来亚人民要求和平、独立的呼声并不因此而低沉下去，反而日益普遍和响亮起来。马来亚各党派、各团体对殖民主义者拒绝和谈的态度也不断加以指责，认为“政府既然没有能力结束战争，就应该接受马共的和谈建议”。它们并且指出只有承认马来亚共产党的合法地位，才是解决问题的现实道路。在广大人民的压力下，马来亚当局才不得不宣布所谓“大赦”声明；但这个“大赦”声明的目的并不是为着求得战争的合理结束，而只是强迫对方投降的一种诡计。关于这一点，马来亚共产党也曾经指出：“这一声明中所提出的结束战争的办法是不合理的、不现实的”。
    由于人民的压力的增加，马来亚当局最后才派代表同马共安排拉赫曼同陈平的会谈。从十月以来，双方代表已经进行了四次接触。但在这个时期中，殖民主义者仍然使尽计谋以进行阻挠和破坏。十一月下旬，在双方代表的第二次接触后不久，殖民主义者竟又调动大批兵力，全面进攻马来亚民族解放军。很明显的，殖民主义者这样做的目的只有一个，就是极力使会谈不能实现；即使实现也不能达成一致的协议。这样，它就好继续进行战争，长期驻军马来亚，保持它在马来亚的殖民地统治。由此可见，马来亚人民为实现和平、民主与独立的斗争是一场困难的、尖锐的斗争。然而，大家知道，人民的力量才是真正伟大的力量。谁真正代表广大人民，谁就会得到广大人民的支持和拥护，而且也就会得到最后的胜利。
    经验证明，和平会谈必须是在公平合理的基础上进行，才能达成双方可能接受的一致协议；任何以一方压服另一方的企图，都是注定要失败的。如果这次会谈不能达成合理的协议，则不仅马来亚人民将继续遭受战争的痛苦，英国人民也同样要受到害处。我们相信，马来亚人民和英国人民都是不允许马来亚战争继续下去的。
    目前全世界爱好和平的人民都很注意马来亚局势的发展，都期望着马来亚的和平、民主与独立早日实现。但是，就在拉赫曼同陈平举行会谈的前夕，外国某通讯社却竟然发出了“陈平代表的是共产党中国”的神话。这无疑又是殖民主义者的恶毒阴谋，企图这样来破坏和谈。必须指出：殖民主义者的任何阴谋诡计，都是会被全世界人民的正义眼睛所看穿的。
    马来亚人民的独立、民主与和平的斗争是马来亚人民自己的事业。然而，他们的这个斗争绝不是孤立的，而是会得到亚洲和全世界人民的关怀和支持的。中国人民一向不干涉别国的内政。中国人民同亚洲和世界人民一样，一向热爱和平，一向主张民族自决，一向反对殖民主义。我们对于马来亚人民的独立、民主与和平的斗争一向寄予深切的同情。我们希望马来亚和谈的双方能够识破殖民主义者的诡计，不受其破坏，能够在公平合理的条件下达成协议，把马来亚从殖民地变为独立、民主与和平的国家。
