Xinhua News Agency, 7th December. The first Scientific Experiment and Research Work Conference of Production Enterprises of the Ministry of Heavy Industry concluded in Beijing today. The conference demanded that leaders of all industrial bureaus and enterprises must place scientific experiment and research work on the agenda of their daily leadership work. The conference also pointed out that in order to enable the production technology level of China's iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical, and building materials industries to reach the international level more quickly, the future technical development tasks of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system are very arduous. Without precise technical analysis and strong scientific experiment and research work, the improvement of the production technology level will be greatly hindered.

This conference made preliminary plans for the scientific experiment and research work of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system for the next two years. According to this preliminary plan, the production system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry will further strengthen scientific experiment and research institutions and experiment and research forces in the next two years. The four industrial comprehensive research institutes of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical, and building materials under the Ministry of Heavy Industry plan to add or expand some experiment and research departments and add necessary experimental instruments before 1957, in addition to striving to complete the construction of intermediate experimental factories. Among them, the Chemical Industry Comprehensive Research Institute will be expanded into four specialized research institutes for paints and plastics, fertilizers, dyes and dye intermediates, and applied chemistry. This conference stipulated that the major production enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry that already have central laboratories should improve them in 1956; production enterprises that do not yet have central laboratories should generally establish them before 1957. The Ministry of Heavy Industry system will also transfer technical personnel from production departments in batches to enrich experiment and research institutions, and will take measures to improve the scientific and technical level of scientific experiment and research personnel.

In order to enable the various scientific experiment and research institutions to carry out work according to the needs of enterprise production development in a planned way, this conference studied the tasks, division of labor, and collaboration of the various comprehensive research institutes, branch institutes, and enterprise central laboratories, and initially drafted the technical development plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system for the next two years, and formulated the experimental research projects of the various scientific research institutions in 1956. The conference demanded that in the future, all scientific experiment and research institutions should actively strive for the guidance and assistance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, relevant universities and other scientific research institutions in their work, and at the same time, they should earnestly learn from the advanced experience in Soviet scientific research.

This conference was held from November 25th to December 7th. Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi gave instructions to the participants on strengthening scientific research work.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th December. At the first Scientific Experiment and Research Work Conference of Production Enterprises of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which closed today, a preliminary technical development plan was formulated for the iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical, and building materials industrial systems under the Ministry of Heavy Industry for the next two years.

This technical development plan shows that in the next two years, the Ministry of Heavy Industry system will continue to increase hundreds of new varieties of steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and building materials. Among them, in the iron and steel industry, new steel grades such as high-quality carbon steel, silicon steel, and low-alloy structural steel will be trial-smelted in open-hearth furnaces; advanced heat-resistant steel and stainless steel alloy steels will be trial-smelted in electric furnaces, and various new carbon high-quality steel and alloy steel will be trial-produced to meet the needs of the automobile, tractor, locomotive, ship, machine tool, and other machinery manufacturing industries and various production and construction. In the chemical industry, many new product varieties will be added in the next two years, including high-grade paints, plastics, dyes for industrial production and construction, and fertilizers and insecticides for agricultural production. In the building materials and non-ferrous metals industries, more than twice as many new products will be produced in the next two years as now.

The technical development plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system points out that in order to enable the various economic and technical indicators of the various industrial systems to reach the international level more quickly and to produce more and better products for the country, the various production systems will experiment with, adopt, and promote dozens of major international new technologies, mainly from the Soviet Union, in the next two years, and will promote domestic advanced experiences in a planned way. Among these new technologies, there are new mining methods in mining; steam blowing in blast furnaces, rapid steelmaking in open-hearth furnaces, and continuous casting in the iron and steel industry; boiling roasting and increasing current density in the non-ferrous metals and chemical industries; and safe operation and rapid rotary kilns in the building materials industry. In addition, the technical development plan also proposes methods for improving the quality of major products, transforming existing equipment, and rationally utilizing resources.

The technical development plan of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system for the next two years is formulated based on the needs of national economic development and the existing level of production technology, and with reference to the international technical development direction and technical experience, mainly from the Soviet Union. The conference believes that with such a preliminary plan, various industrial systems and enterprises can have a unified goal of striving to improve the production technology level of enterprises, and various production activities and scientific experiment and research work will also have a basis, which will strongly promote the development of production technology.

    重工业部召开科学试验研究工作会议
    初步规划科学研究和技术发展工作
    新华社七日讯重工业部生产企业第一届科学试验研究工作会议今天在北京闭幕。会议要求各工业管理局和各企业的领导人员，必须把科学试验研究工作提到日常领导工作的日程上来。会议并且指出：要使我国钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料等工业的生产技术水平更快地达到国际水平，重工业部系统今后的技术发展任务是很繁重的；如果没有精确的技术分析和强有力的科学试验研究工作，生产技术水平的提高就会受到很大阻碍。
    这次会议对重工业部系统今后两年的科学试验研究工作做了初步规划。根据这个初步规划，重工业部生产系统今后两年将进一步增强科学试验研究机构和试验研究力量。重工业部所属的钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料四个工业综合研究所，计划在一九五七年以前，除争取完成中间实验工厂的建设以外，还要增添或扩充一些试验研究部门，增添必要的试验仪器。其中的化学工业综合研究所，将扩充为油漆和塑料、肥料、染料和染料中间体、应用化学四个专业研究所。这次会议规定，重工业部所属主要生产企业中，已经有中央试验室的都要在一九五六年使它健全起来；还没有中央试验室的生产企业，要在一九五七年以前普遍建立起来。重工业部系统还将分批从生产部门抽调技术人员，来充实试验研究机构，并且将采取措施来提高科学试验研究人员的科学技术水平。
    这次会议为了使各科学试验研究机构能够有计划地根据企业生产发展的需要进行工作，对各综合研究所、分所和企业中央试验室的任务、分工和协作等问题作了研究，并且初步拟订了重工业部系统今后两年的技术发展规划，订出各科学研究机构在一九五六年的试验研究项目。会议要求各科学试验研究机构，今后在工作中要主动地争取中国科学院、有关高等学校和其他科学研究机关的指导和帮助，同时要认真学习苏联科学研究中的先进经验。
    这次会议是在十一月二十五日到十二月七日举行的。国务院副总理陈毅曾向到会人员作了关于加强科学研究工作的指示。
    新华社七日讯今天闭幕的重工业部生产企业第一届科学试验研究工作会议上，初步制定出重工业部所属钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料等产业系统在今后两年的技术发展规划。
    这个技术发展规划说明，重工业部系统在今后两年中，将继续增加几百种钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料的新品种。其中，钢铁工业方面要在平炉试炼优质炭素钢、矽钢、低合金结构钢；在电炉试炼高级耐热钢、不锈钢等合金钢的新钢种，还要试制各种新的炭素优质钢材和合金钢材，来满足汽车、拖拉机、机车、船舶、工作母机等机器制造业和其他各种生产建设上的需要。化学工业方面，今后两年要增加很多种新的产品品种，其中包括工业生产建设用的高级油漆、塑料、染料和农业生产用的肥料和杀虫药剂。建筑材料和有色金属工业方面，今后两年也都要生产比现在多一倍以上的新产品。
    重工业部系统的技术发展规划指明，为了使各产业系统各项经济技术指标更快地达到国际水平，给国家生产更多更好的产品，今后两年各生产系统将要试验采用和推广几十种以苏联为主的重大的国际新技术，并且有计划地推广国内的先进经验。这些新技术中，在采矿方面有新采矿法等；在钢铁工业方面有高炉蒸汽鼓风、平炉快速炼钢和连续铸锭等；在有色金属和化学工业方面，有沸腾焙烧、提高电流密度等；在建筑材料工业方面，有安全运转和快速转窑等。此外，在技术发展规划中，对于提高主要产品质量、改造现有设备、合理利用资源等问题，也提出了改进的办法。
    重工业部系统今后两年的技术发展规划，是根据国民经济发展的需要和现有的生产技术水平，并且参照了以苏联为主的国际技术发展方向和技术经验制定的。会议认为，有了这样一个初步规划，就可以使各产业系统和各企业在提高企业生产技术水平方面有了一致的努力目标，各种生产活动和科学试验研究工作也有所依据，从而将有力地促进生产技术的发展。
