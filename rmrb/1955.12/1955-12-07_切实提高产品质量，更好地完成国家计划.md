    The national state-owned and central-public-private joint textile enterprises are expected to complete 101.04% of the total output value plan for 1955. Production of main products: cotton yarn is expected to complete 100.29%, cotton cloth is expected to complete 100.22%, printed and dyed cloth is expected to complete 100.95%, and woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, knitted goods, etc. are also expected to complete the annual plan. The labor productivity plan is expected to be completed at 100.23%. The total cost of commodity products is expected to be reduced by 2.1% for the whole year compared with the plan, and the cost of comparable products is reduced by 3.25% compared with 1954. The financial profit delivery plan is expected to be completed at 108.25%.

    This year, under the leadership of the local Party committees, all textile enterprises generally mobilized the masses, exposed waste in various aspects, and comprehensively carried out the conservation movement. The economic accounting system was gradually implemented, a final accounting meeting system or a cost analysis meeting system was established, and the financial cost management of enterprises was improved. From January to September this year, the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn by state-owned and central-public-private joint cotton textile enterprises has decreased significantly. From January to September, state-owned cotton, wool, hemp, silk, printing and dyeing, and textile machinery manufacturing enterprises saved 10.05 million yuan in raw materials compared with the plan. Material consumption has also gradually decreased, and the national auxiliary materials have been reduced by 3.7 million yuan compared with the plan, a reduction rate of 10.31%. The sizing rate of cotton textiles has been greatly reduced; the caustic soda recovery rate of printing and dyeing factories has also been improved. In terms of labor, the allocation of labor force was strengthened, surplus personnel were actively dealt with, and some unreasonable wage systems were abolished, thus saving manpower and wages. Enterprises have also begun to pay attention to the conservation of working capital. As of the end of August, the value of accumulated materials processed nationwide was 15.63 million yuan, and it is estimated that another 33 million yuan can be processed by the end of the year.

    Although some of the main indicators of the textile industry are expected to complete the national plan this year, and certain achievements have been made in conservation, the product quality plan has not been completed well, especially the quality of cotton textiles and printed and dyed products, which declined severely in the second and third quarters.

    If only viewed from the report figures of various enterprises, the standard product rate of cotton yarn in some enterprises is also above 90%; the first-class product rate of cotton cloth and printed and dyed cloth in various enterprises generally completed the planned target. However, the serious situation of poor quality is concealed under the planned figures. In terms of cotton yarn, the main problems are insufficient strength, and many cotton knots and impurities. In terms of cotton cloth, the main problems are many cotton knots and impurities, unstable breaking strength, and many enterprises complete the first-class product rate plan by repairing, washing, and mending. Some enterprises even have serious cases of under-inspection of substandard cloth. In terms of printing and dyeing, the main problems are large elongation, poor color fastness, and dull colors. The elongation of printed and dyed products in some printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai and Qingdao reached 7% to 8%, and individual products in Shanghai even reached 10%. Due to excessive elongation and excessive widening of the width, the shrinkage rate of products in the warp and weft directions is generally above 5%, and individual varieties even reach 10%. The color fastness is poor, the worker-peasant blue cloth turns red, the aniline turns green, and the water washing fades. The main problems with woolen textiles are insufficient weight of yarn, and many streaks, patterns, and stains on woolen products, resulting in a high rate of matching and re-dyeing. The quality of other silk, rayon, linen cloth, sacks, etc. is also very unstable.

    The decline in product quality has caused great losses to the national economy and aroused consumer dissatisfaction. The main reasons for the decline in product quality are:

    First, the supply of raw cotton is uneven, and the quality of cotton used is declining month by month. Due to the poor cotton harvest last year, cotton textile factories have been using yellow cotton and cotton stripped from the boll in large quantities since April this year. The average length of blended cotton for medium-count yarn has decreased, and the grade of blended cotton has also decreased by about one level. The usage of yellow cotton and cotton stripped from the boll reached 55% in June, and once reached 100% in the third quarter. For a period of time, even the cotton used for civilian wadding was taken to textile factories for spinning. These inferior cottons have short fibers, weak strength per unit fiber, many impurities, and low grades. The strength of the yarn and cloth woven from them is also reduced, and the number of cotton knots and impurities is increased. In addition, there are some problems with the supply of raw cotton. Textile factories have too little raw cotton for turnover, and the varieties of raw cotton are complex and change frequently, making it difficult for textile factories to grasp the performance of raw cotton and use various raw cottons rationally. This is an objective reason for the decline in the quality of cotton textile products this year.

    Second, although the Ministry of Textile Industry proposed to practice economy on the basis of ensuring product quality when arranging work this year, it did not grasp the improvement of product quality tightly enough. Regarding the possible decline in product quality due to the decline in the quality of raw cotton, and the possible tendency of one-sided conservation after the conservation work was carried out, there was not enough estimation in advance, so it failed to remind its subordinate enterprises to prevent it early. After the work was arranged, it did not promptly conduct in-depth inspection and supervision, so it failed to discover problems and help enterprises solve problems in a timely manner. In addition, some regulations on product quality are not perfect, which also has a certain impact on ensuring and improving quality.

    Third, the technical management of various enterprises still has shortcomings. In particular, general enterprises have not implemented the policy of practicing economy on the basis of ensuring product quality, but only one-sidedly save raw materials and ignore product quality. In order to save cotton, some enterprises use too much recycled cotton, or increase recycling and reduce cotton waste in the case of high impurity content in raw cotton. As a result, the impurities in cotton yarn are increased and the strength of cotton yarn is reduced. Some enterprises even use the tolerance range in the quality standards of yarn and cloth to intentionally spin the yarn lighter in order to achieve the purpose of saving the amount of cotton used per unit; some intentionally adopt the method of increasing the tension of the weaving machine to achieve the purpose of reducing the amount of yarn used. In terms of printed and dyed products, quality is also affected by reducing the amount of materials used or reducing necessary technological processes. For example, in order to save dyes, some enterprises make the refined yuan cloth turn green and the background color of dark printed fabrics not bright; in order to save fuel, some enterprises stop using singeing machines or increase the speed of singeing machines and reduce the flame temperature, resulting in incomplete singeing. The main reason for the one-sided conservation tendency is that the leading staff of enterprises have capitalist management ideas. Many leading staff of enterprises only see that one-sidedly saving raw materials can reduce the unit cost of their enterprises, but they do not see the losses to the national economy and the dissatisfaction of the broad masses caused by the decline in product quality; many enterprises put saving raw materials and improving product quality in opposition, believing that to improve quality, it is necessary to use more raw materials, and to use less raw materials, it is impossible to ensure and improve product quality. When the leading organs issue conservation targets, they do not consider whether it can be done in practice and whether it will affect quality, but only one-sidedly pursue conservation figures. Some leading staff of enterprises believe that since the raw materials of the textile industry cannot keep up with the production needs, they should pay more attention to saving raw materials and less attention to improving quality. In order to achieve the goal of one-sided conservation, some enterprises even resort to fraud in quality. This bourgeois ideology that only proceeds from the interests of the enterprise and lacks a high degree of responsibility to consumers is the main obstacle to improving product quality at present.

    It should be pointed out that although the quality of textile industrial products in the fourth quarter has improved, the main reason for the improvement is that new cotton has been put on the market, and the quality of raw cotton has improved. For printed and dyed products, wool, hemp, and silk textiles, because the quality of raw materials has not improved, the improvement in product quality is not significant. In order to ensure the completion of this year's national plan, in addition to continuing to deeply carry out conservation work, all textile enterprises must pay special attention to improving product quality, and must restore product quality to the highest level this year, and at the same time prepare for improving product quality next year. To this end, all enterprises must:

    1. In conjunction with summarizing this year's work, conduct in-depth education among all employees and technicians, so that they can all recognize the importance of improving product quality, criticize various erroneous ideas that ignore quality, and find out the main reasons for poor product quality. At the same time, formulate practical improvement plans and measures, and mobilize all employees and technicians to earnestly implement them.

    2. Strengthen technical management. In addition to paying attention to the planned implementation of some basic systems of technical management, each enterprise should classify and rank the existing technical organizational measures and make technical appraisals respectively. Measures that are beneficial to both saving raw materials and improving quality should be implemented, and measures that are not conducive to improving product quality should be cancelled or improved. In addition, some new technical organizational measures should be researched and formulated according to production needs.

    Now there are only twenty days left in 1955. In order to thoroughly overcome the tendency to ignore product quality, all management bureaus must conduct in-depth inspection of work and promptly solve the problems found in the inspection. Enterprises and related personnel who consistently fail to pay attention to improving product quality must be severely criticized, and disciplinary actions should be taken when necessary.

### 切实提高产品质量，更好地完成国家计划

    切实提高产品质量，更好地完成国家计划
    纺织工业部办公厅主任　梁文英
    全国国营和中央公私合营纺织企业，预计可以完成一九五五年总产值计划的百分之一○一·○四。主要产品产量：棉纱预计可以完成百分之一○○·二九，棉布预计可以完成百分之一○○·二二，印染布预计可以完成百分之一○○·九五，毛织品、绢丝织品、针织品等预计也能完成全年计划。劳动生产率计划预计可以完成百分之一○○·二三。全部商品产品成本预计全年可较计划降低百分之二·一，其中可比产品的成本比一九五四年降低百分之三·二五。财务利润上缴计划预计可完成百分之一○八·二五。
    今年，各纺织企业一般都在各地党委的领导下，发动了群众，揭发了各方面的浪费现象，全面开展了节约运动。逐步地贯彻执行了经济核算制，建立了决算会议制度或成本分析会议制度，改善了企业的财务成本管理。今年一至九月份国营和中央公私合营棉纺织企业，每件纱的用棉量都下降很多。国营棉、毛、麻、丝、印染和纺织机械制造企业，一至九月份原料方面的节约比计划降低一千零五万元。材料消耗额也逐步下降，全国辅助材料比计划降低三百七十万元，降低率为百分之一○·三一。棉纺织品的上浆率有了很大降低；印染厂的烧碱回收率也有提高。在劳动方面，加强了劳动力的调配，积极处理了多余人员，取消了一些不合理的工资制度，因而节约了人力和工资。流动资金的节约工作，各企业也开始注意了，至八月底为止，全国处理了积压物资价值一千五百六十三万元，估计到年底还可再处理三千三百万元。
    纺织工业今年的一些主要指标虽然预计可以完成国家计划，在节约方面也取得了一定的成绩，但是，产品质量计划完成得很不好，特别是棉纺织品和印染品的质量，在第二、第三季度都有严重的下降。
    如果仅从各企业的报表数字上看，有些企业的棉纱标准品率也在百分之九十以上；各个企业的棉布和印染布的正品率，一般都完成了计划指标。但是，在计划数字下面掩盖了质量低劣的严重情况。棉纱方面，主要是强力不够，棉结、杂质多。棉布方面，主要是棉结、杂质多，断裂强度不稳定，而且很多企业是借修、洗、织补来完成正品率计划的。有些企业甚至有严重的次布漏验情况。印染方面，主要是伸长率大，染色牢度差，花色不鲜艳。上海、青岛有些印染厂的印染品伸长率达百分之七到八，上海的个别产品甚至曾达到百分之十。由于伸长过大和幅门过分拉宽，产品经向纬向的缩水率一般都在百分之五以上，个别品种甚至达到百分之十。染色坚牢度差，工农蓝布泛红，安尼林泛绿，水洗落色。毛纺织品主要是绒线的重量不够，毛线品的条痕、条花、斑渍多，因此拼匹率大，复染率高。其他丝、绢、亚麻布、麻袋等的质量也很不稳定。
    产品质量下降，给国民经济造成很大损失，引起消费者的不满。造成产品质量下降的主要原因是：
    第一，原棉供应不均匀，用棉质量逐月下降。由于去年棉花歉收，今年从四月份起棉纺织厂即大量使用黄花和剥桃棉。中支纱混棉平均长度下降，混棉品级也下降一级左右。黄花和剥桃棉的使用量，六月份达百分之五十五，第三季度曾高达百分之一百。有一个时期甚至把供民用的絮棉也拿到纺织厂纺纱。这些次等棉花，纤维短、单位纤维强力弱、含杂多、品级低，纺织成的纱、布的强力也降低，棉结、杂质增加。再加上原棉供应还有一些问题，纺织厂周转的原棉太少，而且原棉品种复杂，变动频繁，使纺织厂很难掌握原棉性能和合理使用各种原棉。这是今年影响棉纺织产品质量下降的客观原因。
    第二，纺织工业部在今年布置工作的时候，虽然经提出要在保证产品质量的基础上厉行节约，但是，对提高产品质量抓得还不够紧。对于因原棉质量下降而可能引起产品质量下降的情况，对节约工作开展后可能产生片面节约的偏向，事前没有足够的估计，因而未能及早提醒所属各企业加以防止。工作布置下去后，又没有及时深入检查督促，因而未能及时发现问题，及时帮助企业解决问题。此外，对有关产品质量的一些规定不够完善，对保证和提高质量也有一定影响。
    第三，各企业的技术管理工作还有缺点，特别是一般企业都没有执行在保证产品质量的基础上厉行节约的方针，只片面地节约原材料，忽视产品质量。有些企业为了节约用棉，过多地使用再用棉，或在原棉含杂多的情况下，增加回收减少落棉。结果就增加棉纱杂质，降低棉纱强力。有些企业甚至利用纱、布质量标准中的公差范围，有意识地把纱纺轻，以达到节约单位用棉量的目的；有的有意识地采取增加布机张力办法来达到降低用纱量的目的。在印染品方面，也因减少用料或减少必要的工艺过程而影响了质量。如有的企业为了节约染料，使精元布泛绿和深色印花布底色不鲜；有的企业为了节约燃料，停用烧毛车或增加烧毛车速度，降低火焰温度，造成烧毛不净的现象。产生片面节约偏向的主要原因，是企业领导工作人员有资本主义经营思想。不少企业的领导工作人员只看见片面节约原材料可以使本企业单位成本降低，而看不见产品质量下降所引起的国民经济上的损失和广大群众的不满；很多企业把节约原材料和提高产品质量对立起来，认为要提高质量，就必然多用原材料，要少用原材料，就一定不能保证和提高产品质量。领导机关颁发节约指标的时候，也不考虑实际能否作到和是否影响质量，只是片面追求节约数字。有些企业的领导工作人员认为纺织工业目前既然原料赶不上生产需要，就应该多注意节约原料，少注意提高质量。有些企业为了达到片面节约的目的，甚至不惜在质量上弄虚作假。这种单纯从本位利益出发，缺乏对消费者高度负责的资产阶级思想是目前提高产品质量的主要障碍。
    应该指出，第四季度纺织工业产品质量虽然有所提高，但是，提高的主要原因，在棉纺织品方面是新棉上市，原棉品质有所提高。印染及毛、麻、丝纺产品，因原料质量没提高，产品质量提高得很不显著。为了保证完成今年的国家计划，各纺织企业除必须继续深入开展节约工作以外，必须特别注意提高产品质量，一定把产品质量恢复到今年最高时期的水平，同时还要给明年提高产品质量做好准备工作。为此，各企业必须：
    一、结合总结今年工作，在全体职工和技术人员中深入进行教育，使他们都能认识到提高产品质量的重要意义，批判各种忽视质量的错误思想，找出产品质量不好的主要原因。同时制定切实的改进计划和办法，动员全体职工和技术人员认真执行。
    二、加强技术管理工作。各企业除应该注意有计划地贯彻执行一些技术管理的基本制度外，对已有的技术组织措施，应该经过分类排队，分别作出技术鉴定。凡对节约原材料和提高质量都有利的措施应该加以贯彻执行，凡不利于提高产品质量的措施应予取消或加以改进。此外，并应根据生产需要，研究和制定一些新的技术组织措施。
    现在一九五五年只剩下二十多天了，为了彻底克服忽视产品质量的偏向，各管理局必须深入检查工作，及时解决在检查中所发现的问题。对于始终不注意改进产品质量的企业及有关人员，必须予以严厉的批评，必要时并且应该给以纪律处分。
