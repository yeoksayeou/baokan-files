The Ministry of Communications Decides to Strengthen the Transformation of Individual Transportation Industry

    The Ministry of Communications has decided to strengthen the socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry. It is expected that by 1957, the nation's animal-powered vehicles and individually operated motor vehicle transportation industry can basically participate in transportation cooperatives.

    The Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recently convened a meeting specifically to study the socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry. The meeting focused on analyzing and studying the current role of the individual transportation industry in the national economy, and criticized the erroneous ideas of some cadres who previously believed that mule-drawn carts, pack animals, and other means of transportation were old, backward, and not worth transforming. The meeting clarified the policy of comprehensively launching a cooperative movement for the individual transportation industry, and formulated measures for classifying the economic components of the private transportation industry and a draft charter for transportation cooperatives. The meeting also exchanged experiences in establishing transportation cooperatives in various regions. The Ministry of Communications has now issued instructions requiring the transportation departments of each province to strengthen leadership over this work and formulate comprehensive plans.

    According to the person in charge of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the individual transportation industry nationwide possesses a large number of various vehicles and pack animals, is widely distributed, and its transportation capacity accounts for a considerable proportion of highway transportation. In 1954, 60 percent of the freight volume completed by the private transportation industry nationwide was for rural transportation. Privately owned mule-drawn carts, pack animals, etc., are currently the main transportation force in China's rural markets. Especially after the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, rural areas need a large amount of inexpensive transportation capacity. Therefore, carrying out the socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry in a planned way and further incorporating this part of the transportation force into the national plan is of great benefit to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

    交通部决定加强对个体运输业的改造
    交通部决定加强对于个体运输业的社会主义改造。预计到一九五七年，全国的兽力车和个体经营的汽车运输业可以基本上都参加运输合作社。
    交通部公路总局最近召开会议，专门研究了个体运输业的社会主义改造问题。会上着重分析和研究了目前个体运输业在国民经济中的作用，批判了某些干部过去认为骡马大车、驮兽等交通工具破旧落后、不值得改造的错误思想。会议明确了对个体运输业全面开展合作化运动的方针，并且制定了私营运输业经济成分的划分办法和运输合作社章程草案。会上还交流了各地办运输合作社的经验。现在交通部已经发出指示，要求各省交通厅加强对这项工作的领导，订出全面规划。
    据交通部公路总局负责人说，全国现有个体运输业所拥有的各种车辆和各种驮兽数量多，分布广，运输能力在公路运输中所占的比重相当大。一九五四年全国私营运输业所完成的货运量中有百分之六十是为农村运输的。私营骡马大车、驮兽等是目前我国农村市场上的主要的运输力量。特别是农业合作化运动迅速发展后，农村需要大量而价廉的运输力。所以对个体运输业有计划地进行社会主义改造，把这部分运输力量进一步纳入国家计划，对于城乡物资交流有很大好处。（新华社）
