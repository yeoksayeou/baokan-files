    Tea Farmers Must Take the Road of Cooperation
    Chen Xuezhao
    On November 24th, I visited Longjing Village in the West Lake district, famous for its green tea, and attended the inaugural meeting of the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative.
    The entire village was immersed in unprecedented joy. At the entrance to the meeting place, right on the main road running east to west through the village, a decorated archway was erected, adorned with many red and green flags. Large red banners displayed slogans: "Get Organized!" "Listen to Chairman Mao, Follow the Communist Party!"... This ancient village, hidden in forests and tea mountains, filled with historical sites, legends, and anecdotes, suddenly appeared so young and beautiful.
    Early in the morning, as the sun just peeked over the peak of Nan Gao Feng, the people of Longjing Village, after quickly finishing their breakfast porridge, changed into new clothes and gathered in twos and threes in front of their doors and on the roads, waiting for the meeting to begin. Women wore floral cotton-padded jackets or coffee-colored woolen coats, elementary school students wore red scarves, male and female cooperative members wore pale yellow silk badges with "Marshal" or "Reception" written on them, and members of the presidium of the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative inaugural meeting wore red silk badges with "Chairman" written on them. Groups of members, old and young, continuously headed towards the meeting place.
    The living room of what was once a landlord's mansion, which after the land reform served as the meeting room for the village peasant association, was now being used by the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative as a borrowed auditorium. The meeting was held here.
    Guests from the province, city, and district were politely invited by the receptionists to sit in the front rows of benches. Guests and members sat crowded together, filling the entire room.
    Chairman Mao's portrait hung in the middle of the rostrum. The solemn and stirring national anthem announced the start of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting, Wang Xiaofeng, a young woman, said: "The Longjing Tea Production Cooperative is established! The farmers of Longjing Village are today embarking on the great road to socialism!"
    The meeting place was silent, as if one could hear people's hearts beating intensely.
    Next, Gao Jingshui, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative, reported on the overall situation of the cooperative and its comprehensive plan for the future.
    Taking the Road of Cooperation
    The Longjing Tea Production Cooperative was formed by merging three tea production cooperatives in the village: the Shifeng Tea Production Cooperative, the Jiuxi Tea Production Cooperative, and the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative, as well as some scattered small mutual aid teams and individual farmers. It currently has one hundred and six households, totaling four hundred and forty-four people. This accounts for eighty percent of the total farming households in the village. Apart from the families of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, only nine middle-peasant households, two poor-peasant households, and two small land-renting households have not yet joined. All others have already joined the cooperative. It currently has 28,485 mu of tea land, 11,415 mu of paddy fields, plus 50 mu of newly reclaimed wasteland on Coral Sand (a small island in the Qiantang River).
    The predecessor of the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative, the 46-household Longjing Tea Production Cooperative, experienced a difficult and tortuous road. In the first quarter of this year, the then 27-household Longjing Tea Mutual Aid Group, seeing people from the district helping the Shifeng Tea Mutual Aid Group set up a cooperative, the group members also requested to set up a cooperative. At the group member meeting, everyone decided to set up a cooperative, but the district did not approve it. What to do if it wasn't approved? If it wasn't approved, set it up themselves. So they set up the cooperative. However, when Zhejiang was "resolutely contracting" mutual aid and cooperation, the district asked them to turn back into a group. The members resolutely disagreed and continued to quietly run the cooperative. Finally, the comrades in the district said to try running it and see.
    Farmers want to take the road of cooperation, farmers want to be rich, want happiness, want progress. Farmers are unwilling to keep wavering on the old road, farmers want to take the road of socialism.
    If It's Not Approved, Set It Up Yourself
    During the time when it wasn't approved, and they set it up themselves, the cooperative launched a sharp struggle against capitalist ideology.
    One wealthy middle peasant in the cooperative, upon hearing that the district did not approve their setting up a cooperative and asked them to turn back into a group, advocated turning back into a group; but everyone wanted to set up a cooperative. This wealthy middle peasant wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, but felt it would be embarrassing to be the only one proposing to withdraw, so he engaged in many activities to encourage withdrawal. He and his son courted some middle-peasant members and individual poor-peasant members to organize withdrawal. When applying fertilizer and digging on the tea mountain, he and his son held secret meetings with middle-peasant members on the mountain to discuss withdrawal methods and countermeasures: How should they answer if others asked why they wanted to withdraw. This wealthy middle peasant, on the one hand, asked the cooperative to guarantee him that joining the cooperative would not reduce his income, and on the other hand, he worked passively. If his income was reduced, the cooperative should compensate him for his losses. He also attempted to lower the wage points of other members to provoke dissatisfaction with the cooperative and encourage other members to withdraw. After the first and second flushes of tea were finished, this wealthy middle peasant and his son came up with another idea, finding the highest-income individual farmer in the village to do detailed calculations, proving that their income had decreased since joining the cooperative. During the activity of this wealthy middle peasant and his son organizing withdrawals, they managed to sway thirteen member households. However, fourteen poor-peasant households resolutely wanted to set up a cooperative. Even if the thirteen households withdrew, the fourteen poor-peasant households still wanted to set up a cooperative. Thus, the cooperative was still set up, and in the midst of the struggle, the cooperative expanded, from twenty-seven households to forty-six households.
    Models Must Undergo the Test of Socialism
    This year, the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative had thirty-three mu of tea bushes frozen to death and renovated twenty mu, which would not be ready for harvest for two years. They used compensation measures, applying topdressing fertilizer to increase yield. They used making high-grade tea and reducing low-grade tea to increase income. As a result, although tea production this year was twenty-five dan less, income increased by one thousand yuan compared to last year. This year's summer and autumn drought was also severe, the worst drought in decades. The tea bushes of member Qi Bangyan were all on high mountains, and three mu out of his 3.6 mu of tea land were frozen to death. His wife could only sit on the tea mountain, crying over the frozen tea bushes. Qi Bangyan had 0.9 mu of paddy fields near the Changqiao bridge outside Qingbomen, which were very far away and on high ground. The cooperative mobilized more than fifty people to fight the drought. More than fifty people carried water from West Lake for five hours, filling the 0.9 mu of paddy fields. Although the drought was so severe, thanks to organized drought resistance, the cooperative's paddy fields yielded an average of over 510 jin per mu, harvesting 1,420 jin. When dividends were distributed after the autumn harvest, even the wealthy middle peasant who conspired to organize withdrawal activities increased his income, only it wasn't as much because he worked passively.
    Qi Bangyan's family of eight, apart from what they ate and used, received eight dan of rice and fifty yuan in cash during the dividend distribution. They also had two pigs at home. Member Li Shoupeng, whose debt from getting a wife had been owed for five years, and who now had a five-year-old grandson, finally paid off his debt this year and received six dan of rice. Member Qi Bangkai had not bought cloth for over twenty years, wearing old clothes begged from this family and that. Now he has made himself new clothes, his son made a Zhongshan suit, bought a pair of sanitary pants, and also has a pig and four months of grain stored. This was something Qi Bangkai could never have dreamed of. Qi Chunquan and his wife are both old, one sixty years old, one sixty-two years old. In the past, except for the one and a half months of the first flush of tea, they relied on government relief every month. Since joining the cooperative, the cooperative has assigned them light work, and after eating and using, they now have six months of surplus grain.
    The facts of the superiority of the production cooperative have educated the farmers, farmers can only take the road of cooperation, only this road leads to brightness and happiness. Among the thirteen households who had been swayed by that wealthy middle peasant and had requested to withdraw from the cooperative, there was differentiation. They started to expose and criticize the activities of his father and son in plotting to sabotage the production cooperative.
    Qi Bangyan, a lower-middle peasant among the old middle peasants, said to the wealthy middle peasant: "You shouldn't have dragged me back! If I didn't have the production cooperative this year, my family would have only had one way to go: death!"
    The members were very angry, some proposed simply kicking this wealthy middle peasant out of the cooperative, because joining the cooperative was voluntary and mutually beneficial, and since he didn't want to join and wanted to harm others, why keep him in the cooperative? But at this time, this wealthy middle peasant requested to be kept in the cooperative, examining how he had no confidence in the production cooperative at the time, and his selfish and self-interested capitalist ideology of only wanting to get rich personally and exploit others.
    Finally, the members still kept this wealthy middle peasant in the cooperative. Some members also proposed keeping him in the cooperative under observation for a few months; later, thinking that he had received the city's model abundant harvest household award flag in 1952, and also feeling that he had already made a self-criticism, they did not keep him in the cooperative under observation, but kept him as an ordinary member, giving him another chance to be tested. Although he was once a model, models must also undergo the test of socialism.
    One Left the League, One Joined the League
    The son of this wealthy middle peasant was a junior high school student and a member of the Communist Youth League. Two years ago, his father called him home from junior high school in the city to engage in agricultural production. When this young man first returned to the village, the young men and women in the village showed him great welcome and respect, praising him everywhere. Especially those elementary school graduates who did not pass the junior high school entrance exam regarded him as a role model. The village's Youth League branch was also very concerned about him. But this young League member disappointed everyone's hopes, not listening to the education of the Party and the League, nor listening to the words of his comrades, only listening to his father's words. His father's activities of swaying other members to withdraw from the cooperative were all conspired with him, and sometimes he was completely in charge. Initially, the members thought that this young man could write, calculate, and stir-fry tea, and would be of great help to the cooperative. But they did not expect that his help was in another aspect, not helping to consolidate and develop the cooperative, but using his ability to write and calculate to actively help his father sabotage the cooperative. It was he who went to calculate detailed accounts with the highest-income individual farmers in the village, spreading the word that participating in the production cooperative was not as good as working alone. The village's Youth League branch had conducted timely education to him more than once, but he still secretly engaged in sabotage. The Youth League branch, with the approval of the higher-level Youth League committee, expelled him from the League to educate other League members and educate him. He was kept in the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative under observation for three months.
    It was in the struggle against capitalist ideology that some young activists joined the League. Xu Gou'er, the cousin of this wealthy middle peasant's son, was one of the new League members. I remember that in 1952, Gou'er's reputation in the village was not the best. Gou'er's father had once been in the tea business, with a strong self-interested, speculative, lazy, and opportunistic merchant habit. Gou'er was inevitably influenced by his father. During the busy spring tea season, Gou'er would wear a pair of broken cotton shoes and sleep late during the day. However, young people are easy to educate, and agricultural production cooperatives are the best schools for educating people. Since the cooperative was set up, Gou'er's awareness has greatly improved, not only becoming a labor expert, but also being able to criticize his father's various bad ideas. Gou'er's credibility among the young people in the village has been rising day by day. Finally, Gou'er joined the League and became a glorious member of the Communist Youth League.
    In the Near Future
    The comprehensive plan of the Longjing Tea Production Cooperative can also be said to be the comprehensive plan of Longjing Village.
    Production Plan: In addition to rice, spring flowers, other crops, and pig raising as a side business, the main tea production in 1956 is required to increase by 35% compared to 1955. Production reaches 39,879 jin. An average of 140 jin per mu. Increase high-grade tea and reduce low-grade tea (low-grade tea accounted for 15% in 1955) by 5%. It is necessary to save, use 390 dan less of large firewood, and use more small firewood. Reduce costs by 26,043 yuan.
    Reclaim 300 mu of wasteland, 50 mu have already been reclaimed this year. 100 mu in 1956, and all will be completed in 1957. In addition to planting tea and rice, 50 mu will be planted with oranges, 50 mu with bayberries, and 10 mu with pears. This will provide fruit to eat and green the mountains. In addition, restore the original bamboo forest.
    Infrastructure Construction: Organize the eighteen ancient tea trees on Shifeng with historical significance; Install electric lights from Siyan Well before the spring leaves of 1956; Establish four tea processing workshops; Purchase two withering machines and three kneading machines in 1956; Build an auditorium using voluntary labor; Establish a veterinary station; Purchase a large truck and a complete set of tea-frying machines in 1957.
    Cultural and Educational Work: Eliminate illiteracy among all Party members, League members, and cooperative cadres in the village in 1956; Middle school students establish a self-study group; Build a ball field, a club, and a library using voluntary labor. Subscribe to three newspapers (Zhejiang Daily, Hangzhou Daily, Youth Daily); Establish a tea-frying training class; Show a movie once a month in 1956; Consolidate the original village amateur drama troupe; Consolidate the original football team.
    Health Work: Expand the original Red Cross health station; Establish a nursery in 1956; Consolidate the original women's health group; Co-operate with the local state-owned Longjing Tea Farm to run a small hospital in 1956; A cooperative member service station has been established, starting to act as an agent for the supply and marketing cooperative's daily necessities.
    According to the comprehensive plan, the labor dividend for 1956 will reach 82,648 yuan, and each work day will increase by 1.2 yuan compared to 1955, reaching 3.24 yuan.
    There is also a biggest goal, to strive to transform into an advanced production cooperative within one year. People are confident to achieve all of this.
    The Production Cooperative is a Big Steamboat
    The inaugural meeting ended at noon.
    In the afternoon, people happily watched the Yue Opera "Mu Guiying" performed by the Hangzhou Honeybee Opera Troupe in front of the Longjing Elementary School stage. There was also a performance by the amateur drama troupe in the evening.
    In the afternoon, I talked to Comrade Gao Jingshui for a long time.
    Qi Bangyan did not watch the opera, but served as "Marshal" at the door. I ran into him as I walked out and asked, "How is it?" He replied with a smile on his face: "Haven't you heard? If my family hadn't joined the production cooperative, then, think about it, how would we have gotten through this winter?"
    The female Youth League member Qi Xiaoying, who was serving as "Reception" by the door, said to me: "That old man just said it very well: 'The mutual aid group is a small broken boat, the production cooperative is a big steamboat, now we are sitting on a big steamboat, sailing to socialism.' Isn't that right!"
    As I walked down the mountain, below the Longjing Pavilion, I saw Xu Gou'er riding a bicycle following behind a large car, speeding towards us. Gou'er saw me, stopped his bike, and greeted me. He was responsible for liaison work today, and had just picked up the large car to send the Honeybee Opera Troupe actors to.
    Indeed, Gou'er had completely changed from 1952: his dark complexion and agile movements showed that he was an aware and industrious young man.
    "Good job! Gou'er, work hard!" I said.
    Gou'er smiled and nodded, following the large car and speeding away.
    I thought about this Longjing Village. Since I first lived and worked there in 1952, the face of the village and the faces of the people have undergone such great new changes! I imagine that there will be even greater new changes in the future, and my heart is excited and stirred.

    茶农要走合作化的道路
    陈学昭
    十一月二十四日，我访问了出产著名绿茶的西湖郊区的龙井村，并参加了龙井茶叶生产合作社的成立大会。
    整个村子沉浸在从未有过的喜悦里。通往会场的路口，正当村子从东到西的要道，搭起了一座彩楼，挂起了许多红绿的旗子。大幅红布上贴着标语：“组织起来！”“听毛主席话，跟共产党走！”……这个隐没在丛林和茶山、有着很多古迹、传说和逸事的古老的村子，今天突然显得那样年青而又美丽了。
    大清早，当太阳刚刚透出南高峰的顶，龙井村的人们一放下吃早粥的碗，换上了新衣服，就三三两两聚集在门前、路上，等候开会了。穿着花布棉衣或咖啡色呢衣的是妇女，戴着红领巾的是小学生，胸前别着淡黄色绸子写着“纠察”、“招待”的是男女社员们，别着红绸子写着“主席”的是龙井茶叶生产合作社成立大会的主席团的成员，还有这里一群那里一群的老老少少社员们，陆陆续续向会场走去。
    曾经是地主大厦的客厅，土地改革以后是村农会的会议室，现在是龙井茶叶生产合作社借用的礼堂，大会就在这地方举行。
    省、市、区的来宾们被殷勤的招待员邀请坐在前面的几排凳子上。来宾们和社员们挨挨挤挤地坐满了整间屋子。
    毛主席的像挂在主席台的中间。庄严的激动的国歌宣布了大会的开始。大会的主席王小凤，是一个年青妇女，她说：“龙井茶叶生产合作社成立了！龙井村的农民今天开始迈向社会主义的大路了！”
    会场里鸦雀无声，彷佛听到了人们的心在激烈地跳动。
    接着，龙井茶叶生产合作社筹备委员会主席高景水报告了这个社的整个情况和今后的全面规划。
    要走合作化的道路
    龙井茶叶生产合作社是由村子里三个茶叶生产合作社：狮峰茶叶生产合作社、九溪茶叶生产合作社、龙井茶叶生产合作社和一些零星小互助组、个别的单干户合并成的。现有一百零六户，总计人口四百四十四人。占全村总农户百分之八十。除了地主、富农、反革命分子的家属外，只有中农九户、贫农两户、小土地出租者两户还没有参加，其它已经全部入社。现有茶地二万八千四百八十五亩，水稻田一万一千四百十五亩，再加新开珊瑚沙（钱塘江中的一个小岛渚）荒田五十亩。
    龙井茶叶生产合作社的前身、四十六户的龙井茶叶生产合作社曾经经历了艰难曲折的道路。今年第一季度，当时还是二十七户的龙井茶叶互助组，看到区里来人帮助狮峰茶叶互助组办社，组员们也都要求办社，在组员大会上，大家决定办社，但是区里不批准。不批准，怎么办呢？不批准，自己办。于是就办起社来了。可是，在浙江互助合作“坚决收缩”的时候，区里又叫他们转组，社员们坚决不同意转组，还是悄悄地办社。最后，区里的同志说试着办办看罢。
    农民要走合作化的道路，农民要求富裕，要求幸福，要求进步。农民不愿老在旧的道路上摇来摆去，农民要走社会主义的道路。
    不批准，自己办
    在不批准，自己办的时候，社里展开了对资本主义思想的尖锐斗争。
    社员中有一个富裕中农，他一听到区里不批准他们办社，并且叫他们转组，就主张转组；但是大家要办社。这个富裕中农心里想退社，可又觉得面子关系，单单他一家人提出退社，说不出口来，于是便进行了许许多多退社的活动。他和他的儿子拉拢一些中农社员和个别贫农社员，组织退社。在上茶山施肥、掘地的时候，他和他的儿子在山上找中农社员开秘密会议，商议退社的办法和对策：如果别人问为什么要退社，应该怎样回答。这个富裕中农一方面向社提出要求给他保证，保证他参加社不减少收入，另方面却又消极怠工。如果减少了收入，社应当赔偿他的损失。他又企图压低其他社员的工资分，以挑起其他社员对社的不满，鼓动其他社员退社。头、二茶结束以后，这个富裕中农和儿子又想出了一个办法，找村子里收入最高的单干户算细账，证明自己入社收入减少了。在这个富裕中农父子组织退社的活动中，被他们拉拢的有十三户社员。但是十四户贫农坚决要办社，即使十三户退社，十四户贫农还是要办社。这样，社还是办起来了，而且在斗争中间，社又扩大了，从二十七户扩大到四十六户。
    模范要经过社会主义的考验
    今年龙井茶叶生产合作社冻死了三十三亩茶蓬，更新了二十亩，这二十亩要两年后才能采摘。用弥补办法，施追肥，来增加产量。用制高级茶，减少副茶，来增加收入。结果，今年茶叶虽然少产二十五担，但是收入比去年增加了一千元。今年夏秋的干旱也是严重的，几十年所未有过的干旱。社员戚邦彦的茶蓬都在高山上，三亩六分茶地冻死了三亩，他的妻子只好坐在茶山上对着冻死的茶蓬痛哭。戚邦彦有九分水稻田，在清波门外的长桥边，离得很远，又是高田，社里动员五十多个人抗旱，五十多个人挑西湖里的水挑了五小时，把这九分的水稻田挑满了。虽然这样干旱，由于组织起来大力抗旱，社里的水稻田每亩的收成平均超过定产五百一十斤，收一千四百二十斤。秋收后分红时，就连那个阴谋组织退社活动的富裕中农也增加了收入，只是因为他自己消极怠工，增加的不多。
    戚邦彦一家八口人，除吃用外，分红时还分得了八担大米，五十元人民币，家里还有两只猪。社员李寿鹏，讨媳妇时欠的债已有五年了，现在孙子也有五岁了，今年才把债还清，还分得了六担大米。社员戚邦开二十多年来没有买过布，穿的都是向这家那家讨来的破旧衣服，现在自己做了新衣服，儿子做了一套中山装，买了一条卫生裤，还养有一只猪，存四个月的粮食。这在戚邦开，简直是做梦也想不到的事。戚春泉夫妇都已老了，一个六十岁，一个六十二岁，过去每年除了头茶一个半月以外，月月都是靠人民政府救济的，自从入社以后，社里分配做些轻便工作，吃过用过外，现在还有六个月的余粮。
    生产合作社的优越性的事实教育了农民，农民只有走合作化的道路，只有这条道路是通向光明和幸福的。被那个富裕中农拉拢而要求过退社的十三户中间起了分化，纷纷对他们父子阴谋破坏生产合作社的活动，展开了揭发和批评。
    老中农中间的下中农戚邦彦对这个富裕中农说：“你不该把我也拉着往后退！我今年要是没有生产合作社，一家人只有死路一条！”
    社员们气愤得很，有的提议干脆把这个富裕中农请出社去，因为参加社是自愿互利的，他既不愿，又想害别人，何必留在社里呢？可是到这时候，这个富裕中农却又要求把他留在社里，检讨了自己当时对生产合作社怎样没信心，自己光想个人发财的自私自利、剥削别人的资本主义思想。
    终于，社员们把这个富裕中农仍然留在社里，也有社员提出把他留社察看几个月；后来，想到他曾在一九五二年得到过市模范丰产户的奖旗，又觉得他已经作了检讨，就没有留社察看，仍让他作为普通社员，再给他一个考验的机会。虽然他曾经是模范，模范也要经过社会主义的考验。
      一个出团，一个入团
    这个富裕中农的儿子是一个初中学生，并且是一个青年团员。前年，他父亲把他从城里的中学叫回家来从事农业生产。这个青年刚刚回到村里来的时候，村子里的青年男女对他表示了莫大的欢迎和重视，到处说着赞扬他的话。特别是那些没有考得上初中的小学毕业生，把他作为学习的榜样。村子里的团支部也非常关怀他。但是这个青年团员辜负了大家对他的希望，不听党、团的教育，也不听同志们的话，只是听他父亲的话。他父亲拉拢其他社员退社的活动，都是和他同谋的，有时则完全由他出面。最初，社员们以为这个青年能写能算，又会炒茶，对社里会有很多帮助。可是没想到他的帮助却是在另一方面，不是帮助巩固社、发展社，而是用他的能写能算来积极帮助他父亲破坏社。是他，去和村子里最高收入量的单干户算细账，散布参加生产合作社不如单干好。村子里的团支部曾及时的不止一次地对他进行了教育，可是他仍然在暗地里进行破坏。团支部得到上级团委的批准，开除了他的团籍，来教育其他团员和教育他。在龙井茶叶生产合作社里留社察看三个月。
    就在同资本主义思想进行斗争中，有一些青年积极分子入了团。这个富裕中农儿子的堂哥哥徐狗儿是新团员中的一个。我记得在一九五二年，狗儿那时在村子里的名誉并不是顶好的。狗儿的父亲在过去曾经一度做过茶叶生意，有浓厚的自私自利、投机取巧、好吃懒做、好占便宜的商人习气，狗儿也不免受了点父亲的影响。当人们忙得没命的春茶季节，狗儿却扱着一双破棉鞋，大白天睡懒觉。但是，青年人是容易教育的，农业生产合作社是教育人的最好的学校。自从办社起，狗儿觉悟大大提高，不仅成了一个劳动能手，而且对他父亲的种种不好思想，也能进行批评。狗儿在村子里青年中的信誉一天一天高起来，终于，狗儿参加了团，成了一个光荣的青年团员。
      在不久的将来
    龙井茶叶生产合作社的全面规划，也可以说，就是龙井村的全面规划。
    生产规划：除了水稻、春花、其它农作物和副业养猪外，主要的茶叶生产在一九五六年要求比一九五五年增加百分之三十五。产量达到三万九千八百七十九斤。平均每亩一百四十斤。提高高级茶，减少副茶（副茶在一九五五年占百分之十五）百分之五。要节约，少用大柴三百九十担，多用毛柴。减低成本二万六千零四十三元。
    开荒地三百亩，今年已开五十亩。一九五六年一百亩，一九五七年全部完成。除了种茶和种稻外，五十亩种橘子，五十亩种杨梅，十亩种梨子。既有果子吃，又能绿化山岭。此外，恢复原有的竹林。
    基本建设：整理狮峰上有古迹性的十八棵茶；一九五六年春叶以前从四眼井接装电灯；建立四个制茶工场；一九五六年置两架杀青机，三架揉拧机；用义务工修建一个礼堂；建立一个兽医站；一九五七年置一辆大卡车，全套炒茶机。
    文教工作：一九五六年在全村党、团员、社干部中扫清文盲；中学生成立一个自学小组；用义务工建立一个球场、一个俱乐部、一个图书室。定报纸三份（浙江日报，杭州日报，青年报）；建立一个炒茶学习班；一九五六年每月放映一次电影；巩固原有的村业余剧团；巩固原有的球队。
    卫生工作：扩大原有红十字卫生站；一九五六年成立一个托儿所；巩固原有妇女保健组；一九五六年和地方国营龙井茶场合办一个小医院；社员服务站已经建立，开始代销供销合作社的日用品。
    根据全面规划，一九五六年的劳动分红将达到八万二千六百四十八元，每个劳动日将比一九五五年增加一元二角，而是三元二角四分了。
    还有最大的一个目标，要在一年之内争取转为高级生产合作社。所有这一切，人们是有信心来实现它。
    生产合作社是只大轮船
    成立大会在中午结束了。
    午后，人们兴高采烈地在龙井小学的戏台前看杭州蜜蜂剧团演出越剧“穆桂英”。晚上还有业余剧团的演出呢。
    午后，我找高景水同志谈了好久。
    戚邦彦没有看戏，在门口担任“纠察”，我走出来正碰着他，便问：“怎样啊？”他满脸堆着笑，回答我说：“你不是已经听到了么？我家要是没有参加生产合作社，那，你想想，今年这个冬怎么过啊？”
    站在门边，担任“招待”的女青年团员戚小英对我说：“刚才那老伯伯说得很好：‘互助组是只小破船，生产合作社是只大轮船，现在我们坐着大轮船，开向社会主义啦。’可不是么！”
    当我走下山来，在龙井亭的下边，望见徐狗儿骑着一辆自行车跟在一辆大轿车的后面，飞驰而来。狗儿看见了我，煞住车，招呼我。他今天负责做联络工作，刚去接了大轿车来送蜜蜂剧团的演员们的。
    真的，狗儿已经完全和一九五二年变了个样：黑黑的脸色，灵活的动作，显出是一个有觉悟的勤劳的青年。
    “好呀！狗儿，好好的工作呀！”我说。
    狗儿微笑着点点头，跟着大轿车飞驰去了。
    我想着这个龙井村，自从一九五二年我第一次到那里生活和工作，这些时以来，村子的面目和人的面目有了多么大的新的变化啊！我想像着以后还要有更大的新的变化，我的心又是兴奋，又是激动。
