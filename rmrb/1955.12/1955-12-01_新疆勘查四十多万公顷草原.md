    Xinjiang Explores Over 400,000 Hectares of Grassland
    North and south of the Tianshan Mountains have many lush and fertile grasslands that can be used to greatly develop livestock. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Animal Husbandry Department dispatched seven grassland survey teams this year to focus on surveying over 414,000 hectares of grassland in areas such as the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, and the Bayingol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. The survey found that these grasslands abundantly grow dozens of nutritious gramineous, leguminous, and mixed-species forages such as sheep fescue and wild oats. These grasslands can graze over 1.22 million sheep, an increase of approximately one-third compared to the current actual livestock carrying capacity. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding was gained of the water sources, climate, soil, pasture growth, and livestock grazing management of each grassland, providing rich data for future grassland planning.

    新疆勘查四十多万公顷草原
    天山南北有着许多水草丰美的广阔草原可以利用来大量发展牲畜，新疆维吾尔自治区畜牧厅今年派出的七个草场勘查队，曾在伊犁哈萨克族自治州、克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州和巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州等地，重点勘查了四十一万四千多公顷草原，查明在这些草原上大量生长着肥羊草、野燕麦等数十种富有营养的禾本科、豆科和杂科牧草。这些草原可以放牧一百二十二万多只羊，比目前的实际载畜量增加约三分之一。经过这次勘查，全面了解了各个草原的水源、气候、土壤、牧草生长和牲畜的牧放管理等情况，给今后进行草原规划提供了丰富的资料。（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
