    Female Worker Qi Jianfang's Advanced Shuttle-Changing Method
    The state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's weaving workshop is promoting the shuttle-changing method created by Qi Jianfang, a female worker and member of the Communist Youth League. Over one hundred and ten shuttle-changing workers in the entire workshop, using this advanced method, can save the country two thousand five hundred and twenty pounds of cotton yarn per year.
    When Qi Jianfang changes the shuttle, she operates with both hands, making the length of the yarn tail that must remain outside each bobbin as short as possible, preventing it from slipping out excessively. At the same time, she also uses the method of pressing short yarn tails with long yarn tails, making each yarn tail two to three inches shorter than even the shortest one previously. She has improved the patrol route and the method of changing shuttles, shortening each patrol trip from thirty minutes to eighteen minutes, and the amount of waste yarn is also more than one-half less than that of ordinary workers.
    Qi Jianfang is a nineteen-year-old primary school graduate who only entered the factory as a shuttle-changing worker last May. She often pays attention to studying and improving each of her operating methods. (Xinhua News Agency)

    女工齐剑芳的先进摆梭法
    国营郑州第一棉纺织厂织布车间正在推广摆梭女工、青年团员齐剑芳创造的摆梭法。全车间一百一十多个摆梭工人，用这种先进方法操作，一年可以为国家节约二千五百二十磅棉纱。
    齐剑芳在摆梭的时候，她用双手操作，使每个纱管必须留在外边的一段纱尾尽量缩短，不再多溜出来。同时她还用长纱尾压短纱尾的办法，使每根纱尾比原来最短的还要短两三寸。她改进了巡回路线和换梭的方法，她每巡回一趟由三十分钟缩短到十八分钟，废纱量也比一般工人少二分之一以上。
    齐剑芳是个十九岁的小学毕业生，去年五月才进厂当摆梭工。她经常注意研究和改进自己的每一个操作方法。（新华社）
