Advancing on the Road of Socialism
More Than One Hundred Pairs of Mine Shafts to be Constructed in the Coal Industry System Next Year
The Ministry of Coal Industry has preliminarily formulated the basic construction plan for 1956. According to the plan, the scale of basic construction next year will be larger than any previous year, and the basic construction workload will be equivalent to 113.8 percent of that in 1955.

In accordance with the principle of focusing on key construction projects, more than 85 percent of the Ministry of Coal Industry's investment next year will be used for industrial construction, of which mine shaft construction investment will account for 76.9 percent. Next year, more than 110 pairs of mine shafts will be under construction nationwide. There will be 50 pairs of newly built mine shafts and restored and renovated mine shafts starting construction next year. In order to ensure the needs of industrial coal, especially coking coal for the steel industry, new coal bases such as Baotou, Xuangang, Yitang, and Pingdingshan, as well as four large-scale coal washing plants for washing and selecting refined coal, will begin construction next year. Next year, 50 pairs of mine shafts will be put into production, including 20 pairs of newly built mine shafts. The large-scale, new-type Xing'antai vertical shaft in Hegang and the Xiejiachi No. 2 and No. 3 vertical shafts in Huainan, designed by our own country, will also be put into production one after another. After these mine shafts reach their designed capacity, the amount of coal produced will be equal to 27.4 percent of the raw coal output of state-owned coal mines nationwide in 1952.

In order to ensure the timely commencement and smooth construction of the mine shafts, the basic construction department of the Ministry of Coal Industry is actively carrying out various preparations for next year's construction. At present, the geological exploration department is seizing the time to compile geological reports for the new wells to be started next year. Each coal mine design unit is concentrating its efforts to complete the design drawings required for the first quarter of next year's construction. The construction teams are also being further reorganized. Each construction unit is actively carrying out winter training and compiling construction organization designs.

Anshan Iron and Steel has Completed Eleven Projects Ahead of Schedule
In the past eleven months of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel has completed eleven construction projects ahead of schedule. According to the statistics of a blast furnace, two open-hearth furnaces, and two soaking pits put into production ahead of schedule alone, the output of pig iron, steel, and steel billets for the country has increased by tens of thousands of tons.

The workers who participated in the construction of these projects all attached importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. The workers who installed the blowers independently installed large blowers supplying wind power to the blast furnace for the first time this year. They incorporated all the more than 1,400 suggestions made by Soviet experts in the past into the operating procedures, and at the same time learned from the Soviet experience of organizing mixed work teams, changing the work teams that were organized according to the type of work in the past into mixed work teams. In the past, it took more than 180 people six months to install a large blower. This year, two blowers were installed. Each only needed more than 50 people to install in three months. In the process of construction of these projects, mutual assistance was developed between the various construction teams and between the construction teams and the production departments, which also greatly shortened the construction time.

Northwest is Preparing to Build Seven Construction Bases
In order to meet the needs of next year's construction, the Northwest Engineering Administration and its affiliated engineering companies are actively preparing to build seven large-scale, regional construction bases.

These construction bases include large open-air prefabrication yards for concrete components, prefabrication yards for medium and small concrete components, concrete mixing stations, mortar mixing stations, aerated concrete product yards, asphalt concrete prefabrication yards, and mechanical repair shops, equipment processing shops, and steel and wood mold processing workshops. After these construction bases are completed, the factory-based and mechanized construction methods can be adopted on a large scale, which will greatly accelerate the progress of the project and reduce the cost of the project.

In mid-October, the industrial base design offices were established by the relevant units. It is estimated that the design of all civil engineering, water supply, power supply, steam, and machinery and equipment projects can be basically completed before the end of the year.

At present, the Second and Third Work Areas of the Northwest Third Engineering Company and the two joint processing plants of the Northwest First Engineering Company have started construction. It is expected that the seven construction bases can be fully completed and put into production by the first quarter of next year.

Yingcheng Gypsum Mine's Gypsum Production Exceeds Previous Years
From January to early December this year, the output of gypsum from Yingcheng Gypsum Mine was 14.72 percent higher than the highest annual output in history and 16 percent higher than the total output last year.

Since the beginning of this year, Yingcheng Gypsum Mine has adopted a specially designed electric rock cutting machine for mining, which has greatly improved production efficiency. The amount of excavation of this electric rock cutting machine per hour is equal to seven hours of manual work by one person.

Yingcheng Gypsum Mine is currently the largest gypsum mine in the country in terms of output. More than 70 percent of the gypsum it produces is used as raw material for manufacturing fertilizer powder. (Xinhua News Agency)

Hulunbuir Trains the First Batch of Tractor Drivers
The tractor driver training class of the Hulunbuir League State-owned Agricultural and Pastoral Farm Administration officially opened on the 14th. After a short period of technical study, the trainees will become the first batch of tractor drivers in the Hulunbuir grasslands. Next spring, they will carry out mechanized farming on large areas of land in the Hulunbuir grasslands to expand the feed base of state-owned pastures. These trainees are all outstanding young workers selected from various pastures. Among the 72 Mongolian and Han trainees who have already reported, 34 are members of the Communist Youth League and 15 are young women. (Xinhua News Agency)

Western Guangdong District Actively Prepares for the Trial Establishment of Advanced Cooperatives
The Western Guangdong District of Guangdong Province is actively preparing for the trial establishment of twenty-four advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

These twenty-four cooperatives are all agricultural production cooperatives that were established earlier, have increased production year after year, have accumulated certain public property, have strong backbones, and have a high level of awareness among their members. For example, the Bianhai First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangjiang County, thanks to the collective efforts, was able to develop diversified operations and increase production by 32 percent last year, even though the dike was washed away and most of the paddy fields were flooded by alkaline water; this year, even without rain for 83 days, it was able to overcome the drought and increase production by 55 percent compared with last year. Over the years, this cooperative has accumulated more than 5,900 yuan of public property, averaging 54 yuan per household. The Dapi Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dianbai County has implemented comprehensive technical reforms and has achieved a bumper harvest for two consecutive years. The entire cooperative has expanded to 280 households, with 45 cadres and backbones above the team leader level, 13 Communist Party members, 12 members of the Communist Youth League, and more than 180 activists. These cooperatives also have great production potential. For example, the Danbu First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dianbai County can reclaim more than 790 mu of wasteland and can also build four fishing ports; after the Hengdong First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Enping County is converted into an advanced cooperative, the income from sideline occupations alone is expected to be more than 14,000 yuan.

After the members of these cooperatives heard that they had been approved by the higher authorities to be converted into advanced cooperatives, their enthusiasm for production was even higher.

Zhoushan Islands Basically Achieve Fishery Cooperation
The Zhoushan Islands have basically achieved semi-socialist fishery cooperation. The number of fishing households joining fishery production cooperatives has accounted for about 74 percent of the total number of fishing households in the Zhoushan Special Zone. Small islands and semi-agricultural and semi-fishing villages that have not yet established cooperatives have also generally established fishery mutual aid groups.

Recently, the winter ribbonfish fishing season has begun. The CCP organizations at all levels in the Zhoushan Special Zone are rectifying the existing fishery production cooperatives and leading these cooperatives to carry out winter fishing production. Some cooperatives have already begun production planning.

A high tide of fishery cooperation appeared in the Zhoushan Islands in 1954. By the autumn fish season of 1955, 104 fishery production cooperatives had been established. Among these cooperatives, 95 percent achieved significant increases in production. Since August this year, encouraged by Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," a second high tide of fishery cooperation has appeared in the Zhoushan Islands, basically achieving semi-socialist fishery cooperation.

Some Agricultural Cooperatives Installed Telephones
The Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model, and the Agricultural Production Cooperative led by Geng Changsuo have both installed telephones. In addition, seven agricultural production cooperatives, three agricultural machinery stations, and ten state-owned farms in Shanxi Province have also installed telephones. The Hebei Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Administration plans to install telephones for several hundred advanced agricultural production cooperatives in the province next year.

After the cooperatives led by Li Shunda and Geng Changsuo installed telephones, the leading cadres of the special zone and the county can often use telephones to promptly arrange work, promptly exchange information and experience with Li Shunda, Geng Changsuo, and others, which is of great help to the work of these two cooperatives. The agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo needs to supply a lot of production materials and sell a lot of raw products, so the cooperative uses the telephone to contact the relevant units in the county and district every day. Once, the livestock of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative led by Li Shunda became ill, and the members immediately called the county seat, and the doctor from the city quickly rushed to Xigou Village. The members were very happy about this. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在社会主义的道路上前进
    煤炭工业系统明年将有一百多对矿井施工
    煤炭工业部初步制定了一九五六年的基本建设计划。根据计划规定，明年的基本建设规模将比过去任何一年都大，基本建设工作量相当于一九五五年的百分之一百一十三点八。
    根据重点建设的方针，明年煤炭工业部百分之八十五以上的投资将用于工业建设，其中矿井建设投资又占百分之七十六点九。明年内，全国将有一百一十多对矿井进行施工。明年开工的新建矿井和恢复、改建的矿井就有五十对。为了保证工业用煤，特别是钢铁工业炼焦煤的需要，包头、轩岗、义棠、平顶山等新的煤炭基地和四个洗选精煤的大型洗选厂都将在明年开始建设。明年还将有五十对矿井投入生产，其中新建矿井有二十对。规模巨大的、新型的鹤岗兴安台竖井和我国自己设计的淮南谢家集二号竖井、三号竖井也将先后投入生产。这些矿井达到设计能力以后，产煤数量将等于一九五二年全国国营煤矿原煤产量的百分之二十七点四。
    为了保证矿井的按期开工和顺利施工，煤炭工业部基本建设部门正积极进行明年建设的各项准备工作。目前，地质勘探部门正抓紧时间，编制明年开工的新井的地质报告。各煤矿设计单位正在集中力量，加紧完成明年第一季度施工所需要的设计图纸。施工队伍也在进一步进行整顿。各施工单位正在积极进行冬季培训、编制施工组织设计等工作。
    鞍钢有十一项工程提前完工
    在今年的十一个多月中，鞍钢提前完成的建设工程已经有十一项。仅据提前投入生产的一座炼铁炉、两座平炉和两座均热炉统计，为国家增产的生铁、钢和钢坯就有几万吨。
    参加建设这些工程的职工都重视学习苏联先进经验和贯彻执行苏联专家的建议。安装鼓风机的职工今年第一次独立地安装供给炼铁炉风力的大型鼓风机。他们把苏联专家过去所提出的一千四百多件建议全部订入操作规程，同时学习了苏联组织混合工作队的经验，把过去按照工种编的工作队改为混合工作队。过去安装一台大型鼓风机要一百八十多人用六个月的时间，今年安装两台鼓风机。每台只需五十多个人在三个月内就安装好了。在这些工程施工过程中，各个工程队之间，工程队和生产部门之间发挥了互助精神，因此也使施工时间缩短了很多。（据新华社讯）
    西北筹建七个建筑基地
    西北工程管理局和所属各工程公司为了适应明年施工需要，正积极筹建七个规模巨大的、区域型的建筑基地。
    这些建筑基地包括大型混凝土构件露天预制场，中小型混凝土构件预制场，混凝土搅拌站，灰浆搅拌站，泡沫水泥制品场，沥青混凝土预制场和机械修配工场，设备加工场，钢筋、木模加工车间等。这些建筑基地建成以后，就可以大规模地采用工厂化、机械化的施工方法，将大大加速工程的进度，降低工程造价。
    十月中旬，各有关单位已经成立了工业基地设计室。预计全部土建、供水、供电、蒸汽和机具设备工程的设计在年底前可以基本完成。
    目前，西北第三工程公司第二、第三工区和西北第一工程公司的两个联合加工总厂已先后开工兴建。预计到明年第一季度，七个建筑基地就可以全部建成并开工生产。

    应城膏矿石膏产量超过往年
    今年一月到十二月上旬，应城膏矿的石膏的产量比历史上最高的年产量多了百分之十四点七二，比去年全年产量多了百分之十六。
    今年以来，应城膏矿采用了一种样式特别的电动割岩机进行采掘，使生产效率大大提高。这种电动割岩机每小时的掘进量，等于一个人用手工工作七小时。
    应城膏矿是全国目前产量最大的一个石膏矿。它所产的石膏有百分之七十以上作为制造肥田粉的原料。（新华社）
    呼伦贝尔训练首批拖拉机手
    呼伦贝尔盟国营农牧场管理局拖拉机手训练班，在十四日正式开学。学员们经过短期的技术学习后，将成为呼伦贝尔草原的第一批拖拉机手。明年春天，他们就要在呼伦贝尔草原的大片土地上进行机耕作业，扩大国营牧场的饲料基地。这些学员都是各牧场选拔出来的优秀青年工人，在已经报到的七十二名蒙古族和汉族学员中，有三十四人是青年团员，十五人是女青年。（新华社）
    粤西区积极准备试办高级社
    广东省粤西区正在积极准备试办二十四个高级农业生产合作社。
    这二十四个社都是建社较早、连年增产、积累有一定公共财产、骨干较强、社员觉悟较高的农业生产合作社。如阳江县边海第一农业生产合作社由于发挥了集体的力量，在去年围堤被冲垮，大部分稻田被碱水淹没的情况下，还能发展多种经营，增产百分之三十二；今年在八十三天没有下雨的情况下，也能战胜旱灾，比去年增产百分之五十五。这个社逐年来已经积累了公共财产五千九百多元，平均每户有五十四元。电白县大陂乡第一农业生产合作社，实行全面技术改革，获得了连续两年的丰收。全社已经扩大为二百八十户，队长以上的骨干有四十五人，共产党员有十三人，青年团员有十二人，此外还有积极分子一百八十多名。这批社同时也有很大的生产潜力。如电白县丹步第一农业生产合作社可以增开荒地七百九十多亩，还可以建立四个鱼港；恩平县横东第一农业生产合作社转为高级社以后，单是副业收入预计就有一万四千多元。
    这些社的社员们在听到上级批准他们转为高级社以后，生产情绪更加高涨。

    舟山群岛基本实现渔业合作化
    舟山群岛已经基本上实现了半社会主义性质的渔业合作化。加入渔业生产合作社的渔户已经占舟山专区渔户总数的百分之七十四左右。还没有办社的少数较远的小岛和半农半渔的乡村，也普遍建立了渔业互助组。
    最近冬季带鱼汛生产开始，舟山专区的中共各级组织正在整顿现有的渔业生产合作社，并且领导这些社进行冬汛生产。有些社已经开始进行生产规划。
    舟山群岛在一九五四年出现了渔业合作化的高潮。到一九五五年秋季鱼汛前，已经建立了一百零四个渔业生产合作社。这些社中百分之九十五的社得到显著增产。今年八月以来，在毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的鼓舞下，舟山群岛出现了第二次渔业合作化的高潮，基本上实现了半社会主义的渔业合作化。（据新华社讯）
    部分农业合作社装上了电话
    全国农业劳动模范李顺达所领导的农林牧生产合作社和耿长锁所领导的农业生产合作社都已经安装了电话。山西省另外还有七个农业生产合作社、三个农业机器站和十个国营农场也安装了电话。河北省邮电管理局计划明年为全省几百个高级的农业生产合作社安装电话。
    李顺达和耿长锁所领导的合作社装上电话以后，专区和县的领导干部可以经常用电话及时布置工作，及时和李顺达、耿长锁等人交流情况和经验，对这两个合作社的工作有很大帮助。耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社需要供应的生产资料和出售的生产品都很多，这个社每天都利用电话和县区各有关单位联系。李顺达领导的农林牧生产合作社有一次因为牲畜生了病，社员马上给县城里打了个电话，城里医生很快就赶到了西沟村。社员们为这件事都很高兴。（新华社）
