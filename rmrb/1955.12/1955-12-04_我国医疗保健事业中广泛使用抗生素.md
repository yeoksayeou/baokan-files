    Widespread Use of Antibiotics in China's Healthcare
    This newspaper reports that antibiotics are widely used in China's healthcare system, with very good results.
    The total amount of antibiotics used in China's healthcare system in 1955 increased by 580% compared to 1952. Clinical application results have proven very good. For example, before the use of antibiotics, the mortality rate for patients with acute appendicitis complicated by peritonitis was generally between 5% and 10%. After the use of antibiotics, it can be reduced to 0.5%. Another example is bone and joint tuberculosis. Many late-stage patients, without the use of antibiotics, required amputation. Since the use of streptomycin in combination with other therapies, joint fixation has not only preserved limb function but also achieved earlier treatment results. Many cases of spinal tuberculosis, treated with antibiotics in combination with other therapies, can greatly reduce the length of hospital stays, which is much better than conservative therapy—lying in a plaster bed for several years. The mortality rate for patients with lobar pneumonia used to be around 30%. With antibiotic treatment, the fever subsides on average by the second or third day, and the mortality rate is reduced to 2.3%.
    According to statistics from Peking Union Medical College Hospital, before the use of antibiotics, the mortality rate of epidemic typhus was 5.4%, and the complication rate was as high as 34%. After the use of antibiotics, since 1953, there have been no deaths or complications among epidemic typhus patients. In the past, clinicians considered the mortality rate of tuberculous meningitis to be almost 100%. Since the use of streptomycin in combination with other drug therapies, the mortality rate can be reduced to 36%. Many more severely ill patients with pulmonary tuberculosis can also have the opportunity to be cured. According to Beijing statistics, with 1949 as 100, the mortality rate of tuberculosis had decreased to 36 by 1954, precisely because antibiotics have played a certain role.
    The application of antibiotics in ophthalmology, otolaryngology, obstetrics and gynecology, stomatology, and other fields has also achieved good medical results.

    我国医疗保健事业中广泛使用抗生素
    本报讯  我国医疗保健事业中广泛使用抗生素，并获得很好效果。
    一九五五年我国医疗保健事业中使用抗生素的总量，比一九五二年增长了百分之五百八十，临床应用的效果证明很好，如在使用抗生素前的急性阑尾炎并发腹膜炎的病人，死亡率一般都在百分之五到百分之十，使用抗生素后可降低到百分之零点五。又如骨关节结核，不少晚期病人，不使用抗生素，需行截肢手术治疗，自从用链霉素结合其他疗法以来，用关节固定术不仅有保存肢体的功能而且获得提早治疗的效果。许多脊椎关节结核，用抗生素结合其他疗法，可以大大减少住院日期，比用保守疗法——睡几年的石膏床好得多了。大叶肺炎病人的死亡率，过去是百分之三十左右，用抗生素治疗结果，平均第二、三日就退烧，死亡率降低到百分之二点三。
    据中国协和医学院附属医院统计，未用抗生素前，斑疹伤寒的死亡率是百分之五点四，并发症高到百分之三十四；使用抗生素后，一九五三年以来，斑疹伤寒患者不再有死亡或并发症。结核性脑膜炎的死亡率，过去临床医师们认为几乎是百分之百，自从使用链霉素并结合其他药物治疗后，死亡率可降低到百分之三十六。许多比较严重的肺结核病人，多数也可以得到治愈机会。据北京市统计，结核病的死亡率以一九四九年为一百，一九五四年已降低为三十六，就因为抗生素起了一定的作用。
    抗生素在眼科、耳鼻喉科、妇产科、口腔科等方面的应用，也收到了很好的医疗效果。
