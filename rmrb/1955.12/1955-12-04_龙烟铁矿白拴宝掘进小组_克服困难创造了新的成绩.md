    Longyan Iron Mine Bai Shuanbao Excavation Team
    Overcomes Difficulties and Achieves New Successes
    To the Editor:
    The Longyan Iron Mine's Bai Shuanbao excavation team has already completed the equivalent of four years' work in two years and eight months, and now has achieved new successes. As of November 25th, based on the current quota, they have already completed the task for March 1957.
    Currently, the location of the Bai Shuanbao team's work is in a certain level tunnel more than 1,700 meters away from the pit entrance. The rock in this area is hard, drainage is difficult, and there is often deep standing water on the ground. However, the comrades in each production shift have consistently adhered to two cycles, ensuring that the level tunnel is excavated ahead of schedule, in order to produce more ore and meet the needs of national industrial construction.
    In mid-November, the team encountered a fault zone with crisscrossing, overlapping layers. The roof collapsed to 7.5 meters, and large pieces of quartzite kept falling. Braving the pouring water, the comrades used crossbeam support to block the falling rocks from the roof. After eight days of hard fighting, they safely passed through this fault zone.
    In the process of fighting against standing water and faults, this team has created many new methods, for example, using the method of digging pump sumps to move the water pump in a timely manner, which controlled the gushing water; using the method of "bringing their own wooden beams" solved the difficulty of untimely material transportation; and in the case of variable rock conditions, flexibly used the "double wedge-shaped cross-slotting method" to avoid misfires. These methods enabled them to overcome many difficulties and overfulfill the monthly plan.

### 龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进小组  克服困难创造了新的成绩

    龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进小组
    克服困难创造了新的成绩编辑同志：
    龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进小组已经用两年又八个多月的时间完成了相当于四年的工作量，现在又创造了新的成绩。到十一月二十五日为止，按照现在的定额计算，他们已经完成了一九五七年三月份的任务。
    目前，白拴宝小组工作的地点，是在距离坑口一千七百多公尺远的某平巷。这个地方岩石坚硬，排水困难，地上经常有很深的积水。但是，每个生产班内同志们始终坚持了两次循环，保证要提前把平峒掘通，以便多出矿砂，满足国家工业建设的需要。
    十一月中旬，小组遇到了一个纵横交错、上下重叠的断层地带。顶板塌陷到七点五公尺，大块石英岩不断掉下来。同志们冒着淋头大水，用穿梁护顶法挡住了顶板的落石。经过八天的艰苦战斗，安全地度过了这个断层地带。
    在同积水和断层搏斗的过程中，这个小组又创造了许多新的办法，例如，用打水泵窝及时搬动水泵的办法，治服了涌水；用“自带道木”的办法，解决了材料运输不及时的困难；在岩石多变的情况下，灵活地运用了“双楔形交叉掏槽法”，避免了呛炮现象。这些办法使他们突破重重困难，超额完成了月计划。张聚仓
