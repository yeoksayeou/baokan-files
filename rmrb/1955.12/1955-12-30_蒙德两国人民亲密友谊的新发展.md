    New Development in the Close Friendship Between the People of Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic

    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, has concluded its friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic. The governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic issued a joint statement on the 27th. This is a historical milestone in the further development and consolidation of the close fraternal friendship between the two countries.

    The joint statement of the two governments confirmed that the two sides hold completely identical views on issues related to common interests. They reaffirmed the importance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence for maintaining normal international relations, expressed their determination to continue striving for world peace and easing international tensions, and expressed the sincere and friendly desire of the people of Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation.

    The people of Mongolia and the German people have established an unbreakable, fraternal and profound friendship since the first day of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. Over the past six years, the diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries have achieved great development. This sincere friendship is not only reflected between the governments of the two countries but also deeply reflected between the people of the two countries. The visit of the cultural and artistic delegation and song and dance troupe of the German Democratic Republic to Mongolia last year, as well as the Mongolia-German People's Friendship Week held throughout the Mongolian People's Republic, are the most vivid proof. The invitation to the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl to visit Mongolia, and the joint statement issued by the two governments, are of particular significance for strengthening the already existing close friendship between the two countries and for safeguarding the indivisible peace of Asia and Europe. The people of Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic have the common great and lofty goal of building a socialist society, and they have an unwavering policy and determination to maintain peace. This friendship cannot be destroyed by any force. The Chinese people express their heartfelt and warm congratulations on the development of the fraternal friendly relations between the people of Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic!

    However, the common goals and achievements of the people of Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic are envied by international reactionary forces. They have tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful development of the two countries.

    Over the past six years since its founding, the increasingly consolidated and developed German Democratic Republic has made brilliant achievements on the road to building socialism. It has become a reliable fortress for the people of all Germany to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and an indispensable and important force for defending peace in Europe and the world. However, for the past ten years since the war, the American war forces have consistently disregarded the wishes of the German people and stubbornly rejected the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals for unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis; they have tried to divide Germany forever and restore the rule of the Junker landlords and monopoly capital in the land of Germany to serve American aggression. Every achievement of the German people has been obtained through unyielding struggle. The Mongolian People's Republic government's expression of complete solidarity with the German people in their struggle for a peaceful and democratic unified Germany is a powerful support for the German people.

    Similarly, the Mongolian People's Republic already has a glorious history of thirty-four years of independence. Since its establishment, the Mongolian People's Republic has made significant achievements in political, economic, and cultural fields. It has moved from a poor and backward country to a wealthy and advanced road. It has pursued a policy of peace in the past and present. Its contribution to the struggle against fascist aggression by all countries and its active struggle to safeguard world peace have won the unanimous praise and admiration of peace-loving people. In terms of international relations, the Mongolian People's Republic has established diplomatic relations with countries that have more than half of the world's population, including the Soviet Union, China, and India, the world's largest countries. Its international status has been infinitely consolidated and improved. However, for the past ten years since the war, the United States has been depriving the Mongolian People's Republic of its legitimate right to enter the United Nations, an international organization. The Mongolian People's Republic government applied to join the United Nations in 1946, 1948, and this year, and expressed its willingness to undertake the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. However, due to the discriminatory policies pursued by the United States, this issue has not been resolved. Especially at the Tenth United Nations General Assembly, the United States instigated the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to obstruct the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations, which is a serious violation of the principles of the United Nations and international cooperation.

    The joint statement of the governments of the Mongolian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic reached common understandings on some major international issues and on strengthening the close friendship between Mongolia and the German Democratic Republic, and put forward positive proposals on these issues. The Chinese people believe that this is beneficial to the common interests of socialism and world peace. The Chinese people fully support these positive proposals and are willing to work to promote the realization of these proposals.

    The Chinese people attach great importance to the close friendship with the people of the Mongolian People's Republic and the people of the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people have close economic and cultural ties with the people of Mongolia and the German people. The recent invitation to the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to visit our country has made a significant contribution to strengthening and consolidating the friendship between the Chinese and German people. The Chinese people will work together with the people of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries to continue to consolidate and develop the unity and cooperation among the people of all countries, and to further strengthen our friendly cooperation with the people of all peace-loving countries in the world.

    蒙德两国人民亲密友谊的新发展
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，已结束了对蒙古人民共和国的友好访问。蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府，在二十七日发表了联合声明。这是两国亲密的兄弟友谊进一步发展和巩固的历史性标志。
    两国政府的联合声明中确认，双方对共同利益有关的问题，意见完全一致。它们重申了和平共处五项原则对于维护国际正常关系的重要意义，表示了继续争取世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的决心，并表达了蒙德两国人民加强经济和文化合作关系的真诚友好愿望。
    蒙古人民和德国人民从德意志民主共和国成立的第一天起，就建立了牢不可破的、兄弟般的深厚友谊。六年来，两国的外交、经济和文化关系，获得了巨大的发展。两国这种真挚的友好感情，不仅表现在两国政府之间，而且深刻地表现在两国人民之间。去年德意志民主共和国文艺工作者代表团和歌舞团的访问蒙古，以及蒙古人民共和国在全国各地举行的蒙德人民友好周，就是一个最生动的证明。而这次以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应邀访问蒙古，和蒙德两国政府所发表的联合声明，对于加强两国已经存在的亲密友谊和保卫亚洲和欧洲不可分割的和平的努力，更具有特殊重大的意义。蒙德两国人民有着建设社会主义社会的远大而崇高的共同目标，有着始终不渝的维护和平的政策和决心，这种友谊是任何力量所不能摧毁的。中国人民对于兄弟般的蒙德两国人民友好关系的发展，表示衷心的热烈的祝贺！
    可是，蒙德两国人民的共同目标和成就，却遭到国际反动势力的妒忌。它们千方百计地企图阻挠两国的和平发展。
    建国六年多来，日益巩固和发展的德意志民主共和国，在建设社会主义的道路上取得了辉煌的成就。它已经成为全德国人民争取实现祖国和平统一的可靠堡垒，成为捍卫欧洲和世界和平不可缺少的重要力量。而美国战争势力在战后十年来，一直不顾德国人民的愿望，顽固地拒绝苏联关于在和平民主的基础上统一德国的合理建议；力图永远分裂德国，并在德国的土地上恢复为美国侵略服务的容克地主和垄断资本的统治。德国人民的每一个成就，都是经过不屈不挠的斗争才得到的。蒙古人民共和国政府表示同为争取和平民主统一德国而斗争的德意志人民完全团结一致，是对德国人民有力的支持。
    同样，蒙古人民共和国已经有了三十四年独立的光荣历史。蒙古人民共和国自成立以来，在政治、经济和文化方面都获得了重大成就。它已经由一个贫穷和落后的国家，走上了富有和先进的道路。它过去和现在都执行着和平政策，它在各国反对法西斯侵略的斗争中所作的贡献，它为保障世界和平而进行的积极斗争，得到了爱好和平人民的同声赞扬和钦佩。在国际关系方面，蒙古人民共和国同拥有世界一半以上人口的国家建立了外交关系，其中包括苏联、中国和印度这样的世界最大的国家。它的国际地位已经无限巩固和提高。但是在战后十年来，美国却一直剥夺蒙古人民共和国进入联合国这个国际组织的合法权利。蒙古人民共和国政府在一九四六年、一九四八年和今年先后提出申请加入联合国，并表示了愿意承担联合国宪章所规定的义务。但是，由于美国执行歧视政策，使这个问题一直还没有解决。特别是在第十届联合国大会上，美国唆使蒋介石卖国集团阻挠蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，这显然是对联合国原则和对国际合作的严重的破坏。
    蒙古人民共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府的联合声明中，对目前国际上的一些重大问题和在加强蒙德两国亲密友谊方面，取得了共同一致的见解，并提出了对这些问题的积极主张。中国人民认为，这是有利于社会主义和世界和平的共同利益的。中国人民完全支持这些积极的主张，并愿意为促进这些主张的实现而努力。
    中国人民极为重视同蒙古人民共和国人民和德意志民主共和国人民的亲密友谊。中国人民同蒙古人民和德国人民在经济和文化方面，都有着密切的联系。德意志民主共和国政府代表团最近应邀访问我国，对于加强和巩固中德人民的友谊作了巨大的贡献。中国人民将同苏联、蒙古和德意志民主共和国人民以及其他人民民主国家人民一道，为继续巩固和发展各国人民之间的团结和合作而努力，为进一步加强我们同世界上一切爱好和平国家人民的友好合作而努力。
