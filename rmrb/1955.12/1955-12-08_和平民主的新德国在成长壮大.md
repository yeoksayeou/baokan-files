A government delegation from the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, will arrive in Beijing today at the invitation of our government for a friendly visit to our country. The Chinese people, who have always held deep sympathy and friendship for the people of the German Democratic Republic, warmly welcome the arrival of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic. There is no doubt that this visit will play a significant role in consolidating and strengthening the solidarity, cooperation, and friendly relations between China and Germany.

The German Democratic Republic is one of the new type of European countries that emerged after World War II. Due to the great victory of the Soviet Union's anti-fascist war of defense, the situation in Germany underwent a fundamental change. In eastern Germany, the remnants of Nazi militarism, as well as the forces of large monopoly capital and Junker landlords, were thoroughly eliminated, and democratic social and economic reforms were implemented. All of this seriously weakened the German aggressive forces that had twice instigated world wars in this century, and created favorable conditions for the peaceful and democratic development of Germany and the rapid growth of German democratic forces. Based on the profound political, economic, and social changes in eastern Germany, the German Democratic Republic was established six years ago. The great significance of the birth of the new Germany lies in the fact that, for the first time in the history of the German state, the German working class, in alliance with the laboring peasantry, seized power; and in the history of Europe, it was the first time that a peace-loving and democratic German state appeared. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic was a great victory for the German people, and also a great contribution by the German people to the cause of peace and progress for mankind. With the development and growth of the Democratic Germany, it is playing an increasingly large influence on the development of the entire German and European situation.

In the six years since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the people of the Republic have made great achievements in consolidating the country, developing the economy and culture, and building socialism. The establishment and strengthening of the new state apparatus, the establishment of the unified working-class party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—and the unity of all democratic parties, the establishment of the leading position of the working class and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance—all of this, coupled with the recovery of the national economy, the smooth implementation of the first five-year plan, and the development of the state-owned economic sector owned by the whole people, has created conditions for the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic.

The resolutions of the Second Party Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held in July 1952, clearly stipulated the construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic: "Due to the development of political and economic conditions, as well as the awareness of the working class and the majority of laborers, socialist construction has become the basic task of the German Democratic Republic."

Due to the division of a unified Germany, the German Democratic Republic has had to overcome the resulting imbalance in various economic sectors, first by developing its own metallurgical and machine-building industries, in order to consolidate its economic independence and ensure the smooth development of the entire national economy.

In recent years, the German Democratic Republic has made great achievements in developing heavy industry. By the end of 1954, the production level of heavy machinery manufacturing had increased to 214 percent of that in 1950, while the metallurgical industry had reached 230 percent. Efforts to expand the power and fuel base to meet the needs of industrial development have also achieved significant success. For example, the production of electricity and coal per capita has exceeded the level of West Germany. The German Democratic Republic is now able to manufacture metallurgical industry equipment, heavy machine tools, steam turbines with a power generation capacity of 50,000 kilowatts, ships with a displacement of 10,000 tons, and various other important industrial machines and equipment. At the same time, the chemical industry and precision machinery industry have also developed significantly.

The industrial development speed of the German Democratic Republic is unprecedented in old Germany. From 1929 to 1936, German industrial production increased by only 4.5 percent, and during the period of war preparations from 1936 to 1938, it increased by 11.5 percent. However, the industrial production of the German Democratic Republic has roughly doubled in the past five years.

While developing industry, agricultural production has also experienced tremendous growth. Due to the implementation of land reform, the high degree of mechanization of production, and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers, the yield per unit area of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic has continuously increased, increasing by one-fifth in 1954 compared to the pre-war period. This year, the agricultural production of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 17 percent compared to last year. A fundamentally significant event in agricultural development is the development of agricultural production cooperatives. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic has increased from more than 1,800 in 1952 to 5,980 in early September this year. At the same time, many agricultural production cooperatives are developing from lower stages to higher stages.

In various sectors of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic, socialist components have already occupied a great advantage. They account for about 86 percent in industry, about one-third in agriculture, and 91.3 percent in wholesale trade. The expansion of socialist production relations has promoted the economic development of the German Democratic Republic and made the basic economic laws of socialism play an increasingly important role.

The steady economic development has guaranteed the increase in the number of employees and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people. There is no unemployment in the German Democratic Republic now, while in West Germany, there are more than 1.8 million completely unemployed people. The real wages of workers in the German Democratic Republic have doubled in the past five years, and the income of farmers has also increased by 80 percent. The commodity price reduction and commodity circulation plan stipulated in the first five-year plan was completed and exceeded as early as 1953. The consumption volume of the people of the German Democratic Republic has rapidly increased. This year, the average consumption of meat per person will reach 50 kilograms, and butter will exceed 10 kilograms. Such a consumption level exceeds that of many major capitalist countries in the West. The cultural and educational undertakings of the German Democratic Republic have achieved tremendous development. For example, the number of students in universities and colleges has more than doubled compared to 1950, exceeding the total number in pre-war Germany.

Facts have powerfully proven that the road of peaceful and democratic development is the only correct road to guarantee the economic prosperity and happy life of the German people. Precisely because of this, the German Democratic Republic, which embodies and promotes the excellent traditions of the German nation and has achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction, is today not only loved by the working people of the Republic, but also a symbol of hope for the entire German people. The people of West Germany see the example of the future of the new Germany from the development of the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic has become a strong fortress for the peace and democratic forces of the entire Germany.

Establishing a peace-loving and unified Germany is the goal consistently pursued by the government and people of the German Democratic Republic for several years. The passage of the Paris Agreement has erected serious obstacles on the road to German unification, but the government of the German Democratic Republic is still making continuous efforts. The German Democratic Republic advocates achieving German unification through the rapprochement of the eastern and western parts of Germany and the establishment of an all-German committee. Just as in economic construction it receives the support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to strive for German unification have also received the firm support of all countries in the socialist camp. It is only due to the obstruction of the Western countries that German unification has not yet been achieved.

Due to their hatred of the freedom and liberation of the people, the Western countries and the West German government have so far been unwilling to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic. However, the German Democratic Republic is not only an objective existence, but is also prospering and growing stronger day by day, and its international prestige is constantly increasing. Closely united with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the government and people of the German Democratic Republic have actively struggled to safeguard European and world peace and promote international cooperation in recent years. The international connections of the German Democratic Republic are constantly expanding. By the end of 1954, the German Democratic Republic was already a member of more than 30 international organizations and 150 international social groups, and a participant in five international agreements. Representatives from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic have participated in 200 international conferences on different topics held around the world in 1954. In the economic field, the German Democratic Republic now maintains trade relations with 102 countries and has trade agreements with 22 capitalist countries.

The treaty on relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic signed in Moscow in September this year further affirms that the German Democratic Republic is a sovereign state enjoying complete freedom in internal and foreign affairs. Whether the imperialists and war forces like it or not, the German Democratic Republic is becoming more consolidated and stronger day by day. It has become an indispensable factor in the European and international situation. It is impossible to solve the German problem and the European problem without regard to the existence of the German Democratic Republic, which is an unchangeable fact, and without considering its opinions and rights.

    和平民主的新德国在成长壮大
    陈维
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应我国政府的邀请，将在今天到达北京，并在我国进行友好访问。对德意志民主共和国人民一向怀着深切的同情和友谊的中国人民，热烈地欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团的到来。毫无疑问，这次访问对于巩固和加强中德两国之间的团结合作与友好关系将起巨大作用。
    德意志民主共和国是第二次世界大战以后诞生的欧洲的新型国家之一。由于苏联反法西斯卫国战争的伟大胜利，德国的形势发生了根本的变化。在德国的东部彻底肃清了纳粹军国主义的残余以及大垄断资本和容克地主的势力，实行了民主的社会经济改革。这一切严重地削弱了曾经在本世纪两次挑起世界大战的德国侵略势力，并为德国的和平民主发展和德国民主力量的迅速成长创造了有利的条件。在德国东部的政治、经济和社会的深刻变化的基础上，六年以前成立了德意志民主共和国。新德国的诞生的重大意义在于：在德意志国家的历史上，和劳动农民结成联盟的德国工人阶级第一次掌握了政权；而在欧洲的历史上，则第一次出现了一个爱好和平的民主的德意志国家。德意志民主共和国的成立，是德国人民的一个伟大胜利，同时也是德国人民对人类和平进步事业的巨大贡献。随着民主德国的发展壮大，它正在对整个德国和欧洲局势的发展起着愈来愈大的影响。
    德意志民主共和国成立六年来，共和国人民在巩固国家、发展经济、文化和建设社会主义的事业中已经取得了伟大的成就。新的国家机器的建立和加强，统一的工人阶级政党——德国统一社会党的成立和各民主党派的团结一致，工人阶级领导地位的确立和工农联盟的巩固，——这一切，加上国民经济的恢复、第一个五年计划的顺利执行和属于全民所有的国营经济成分的发展，为德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业创造了条件。
    一九五二年七月举行的德国统一社会党第二次党代表会议的决议，为在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义作出了明确的规定：“由于政治及经济条件以及工人阶级与大多数劳动者的觉悟已有了那样的发展，使社会主义建设已经成为德意志民主共和国的基本任务。”
    由于统一的德国的分裂，德意志民主共和国曾经必须克服由此造成的经济各部门不够平衡的现象，首先是发展自己的冶金工业和机器制造工业，以便巩固本国的经济独立和保证整个国民经济的顺利发展。
    这些年来，德意志民主共和国在发展重工业方面已有了很大的成就。到一九五四年底为止，重型机器制造业的生产水平已增加到一九五○年的百分之二百一十四，而冶金工业则达到百分之二百三十。为了扩大电力和燃料基地以适应工业发展需要的努力，也获得了显著的成就。如按人口平均计算，电力和煤产量已经超过了西德的水平。现在德意志民主共和国能够制造冶金工业设备、重型机床、发电能力达五万瓩的汽轮机，排水量达一万吨的船舶和其他各种重要的工业机器与装备。同时，化学工业和精密机械工业也有了长足的发展。
    德意志民主共和国的工业发展速度是旧德国所没有过的。从一九二九到一九三六年，德国工业生产只增加了百分之四点五，在一九三六到一九三八年的备战期间，增加了百分之十一点五。但是德意志民主共和国的工业生产在近五年内就增加了一倍左右。
    与发展工业的同时，农业生产也有了巨大的增长。由于实行了土地改革，生产的高度机械化和广泛使用化学肥料，德意志民主共和国农业的单位面积产量不断提高，一九五四年比战前增加了五分之一。今年，德意志民主共和国的农业生产将比去年增加百分之十七。农业发展中具有根本意义的事情，是农业生产合作社的发展。现在德意志民主共和国的农业生产合作社已从一九五二年的一千八百多个增加到今年九月初的五千九百八十个。同时，许多农业生产合作社正在从低级阶段发展到高级阶段。
    在德意志民主共和国国民经济各部门中，社会主义成分已经占有很大的优势。它在工业中占百分之八十六左右，在农业中占三分之一左右，在批发贸易中占百分之九十一点三。社会主义生产关系的扩大促进了德意志民主共和国经济的发展，并使社会主义基本经济规律发生愈来愈大的作用。
    经济的稳步发展保证了就业人数的增加和劳动人民物质和文化生活水平的不断提高。现在德意志民主共和国已经没有失业的现象，而在西德，有着一百八十多万的完全失业者。德意志民主共和国工人的实际工资五年来已提高了一倍，农民的收入也增加了百分之八十。第一个五年计划所规定的商品减价和商品流转计划早在一九五三年就已完成和超过。德意志民主共和国人民的消费量有了迅速增加。今年，每人的肉类消费量将平均达到五十公斤，黄油超过十公斤。这样的消费水平是超过西方许多主要资本主义国家的。德意志民主共和国的文化教育事业获得了巨大的发展。例如，高等学校的学生人数已比一九五○年增加了一倍以上，超过了战前全德国的总数。
    事实已经有力地证明，和平与民主发展的道路，是保证德国人民经济繁荣和生活幸福的唯一正确的道路。正是因为这样，所以体现和发扬着德国民族的优良传统、在建设社会主义的事业上已经获得辉煌成就的德意志民主共和国，今天不但得到共和国劳动人民的热爱，而且成为全德国人民希望的象征。西德的人民从德意志民主共和国的发展看到新德国的未来的榜样。德意志民主共和国已成为全德国的和平民主力量的坚强堡垒。
    建立一个爱好和平的统一的德国，是德意志民主共和国政府和人民几年来所一贯追求的目标。巴黎协定的通过在德国统一的道路上树立了严重的障碍，但是德意志民主共和国政府仍然进行着不断的努力。德意志民主共和国主张通过德国东西两部分的接近和建立全德委员会的途径来实现德国统一。正如在经济建设方面得到苏联和各人民民主国家的支持一样，德意志民主共和国为争取德国统一的努力也受到了整个社会主义阵营各国的坚决支持。只是由于西方国家的阻挠，德国的统一现在还没有得到实现。
    由于仇视人民的自由和解放，西方国家和西德政府迄今不愿承认德意志民主共和国的存在。但是德意志民主共和国不仅是客观的存在，而且一天天繁荣壮大，它的国际威信在不断地增长。同苏联和人民民主国家紧密地团结一起，德意志民主共和国政府和人民这些年来积极地为维护欧洲与世界的和平、促进国际间的合作而斗争。德意志民主共和国的国际联系不断扩大。到一九五四年底为止，德意志民主共和国已经是三十多个国际组织、一百五十个国际社会团体的成员，是五个国际性协定的参加者。德意志民主共和国的各方面的代表人物一九五四年内曾经参加过在世界各地举行的两百个不同内容的国际性的会议。在经济方面，德意志民主共和国现在同一百零二个国家维持着贸易关系，并和二十二个资本主义国家订有贸易协定。
    今年九月间在莫斯科签订的苏联和德意志民主共和国关系条约，更肯定了德意志民主共和国是享有内政外交方面的完全自由的主权国家。不管帝国主义和战争势力喜欢不喜欢，德意志民主共和国还是一天比一天巩固和强大。它已经成为欧洲和国际局势中一个不容忽视的因素。不顾德意志民主共和国的存在这一不可改移的事实，不考虑它的意见和权利，就不可能解决德国问题和欧洲问题。
