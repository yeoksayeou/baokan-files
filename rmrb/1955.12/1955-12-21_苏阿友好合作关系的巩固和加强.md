    Consolidation and Strengthening of Soviet-Afghan Friendly Cooperative Relations

    After visiting India and Burma, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, visited Afghanistan, and held sincere and friendly talks with Afghan Prime Minister Daud Khan. On December 18, they issued a joint statement and a joint communique on economic relations between the two countries regarding the results of the talks. At the same time, plenipotentiary representatives of the Soviet and Afghan governments signed a protocol on extending the term of validity of the Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression concluded between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan on June 24, 1931.

    The visit of the Soviet government leaders to Afghanistan and the important achievements made by the two countries under the guidance of a peace-loving good-neighborly policy are a new and significant step in the development of the consistently friendly relations between the Soviet and Afghan peoples, and are a positive contribution to consolidating peace in Asia and the world, further easing international tensions, and promoting the Geneva spirit.

    The joint statement of the two countries correctly expresses the sincere desire for peace of the people of all countries in the world. It affirms the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, fully conforms to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and is a solid foundation for ensuring peace and mutual understanding between the people of all countries. The two governments believe that the Four-Power Summit Conference held in Geneva and the subsequent Foreign Ministers' Conference have produced positive results in easing international tensions and ensuring peace. Therefore, both parties expressed their hope that these countries will strive to convene similar meetings again to resolve differences between countries through consultation. At the same time, in order to stabilize world peace and promote understanding between countries, the two countries believe that universal disarmament and unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons are necessary. Atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes to promote the development of science and improve the living standards of mankind.

    In order to safeguard peace and security in the East, the Soviet-Afghan joint statement specifically pointed out that "the current situation and tensions in the East are a threat to world peace"; and unanimously agreed that all unresolved issues in the Far East must be resolved for the sake of peace; the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored; and issues related to China must be resolved with respect for the national rights of the Chinese people. This clear stand of the Soviet and Afghan countries in safeguarding peace is not only a support for the Chinese people's just struggle to defend their national sovereignty and strive for peace in Asia, but also an encouragement to the people of all countries in the East in their struggle for peace and independence. Because, the current tense situation in the East is entirely caused by the aggressive actions of Western colonial countries. They organize military aggression groups in the East, establish military bases, carry out various aggressive activities and grossly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, thereby seriously threatening the peace and independence of countries in the East.

    The strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan is a good example of peaceful cooperation between countries with different political systems. The signing of various important documents between the two countries on further developing friendly cooperative relations once again confirms the firm will of the Soviet and Afghan peoples to demand friendship, peace and cooperation. These documents reflect the determination of both parties to take various measures to develop and consolidate closer political, economic and cultural ties between the two countries. To achieve this lofty goal, the two governments agreed to continue to hold talks in the future to study forms of further mutually beneficial economic and technological cooperation. The Soviet Union agreed to provide Afghanistan with technical assistance and financial assistance in the form of loans in the work plan for developing the Afghan economy. The constantly expanding economic ties between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan are of great significance for the development of Afghanistan's peaceful economy; and the development of Afghanistan's peaceful economy is a reliable basis for maintaining and consolidating its national independence.

    The extension of the term of validity of the Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression concluded between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan on June 24, 1931, is a brilliant achievement of the two countries' peaceful cooperation and good-neighborly policy. This powerfully proves that as long as there is a desire for peaceful cooperation and mutual respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, countries can fully coexist peacefully. As everyone knows, there has long been a solid friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. As early as 1919, Afghanistan waged a heroic struggle against the colonialists and won its independence. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognize Afghan sovereignty and established normal diplomatic relations with it. In 1921, the Russian Federal Republic and Afghanistan signed a treaty of peace and friendly relations. This was the first equal treaty in the history of Afghanistan. The Treaty of Neutrality and Non-Aggression between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, signed in 1926 and revised in 1931, further consolidated the good-neighborly relations between the two countries. Now that the Soviet Union and Afghanistan have decided to extend the term of validity of this treaty, it will surely further promote the consolidation of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

    For many years, Western colonialists have brought heavy disasters to the Afghan people. Their domination has hindered the development of the Afghan economy and made the Afghan people live in poverty for a long time. But the great Soviet people treat the Afghan people with sympathy and equality, and help the Afghan people in all aspects. The warm reception and welcome received by the Soviet leaders during their visit to Afghanistan fully expressed the friendly feelings of the Afghan government and people towards their neighbor.

    The Soviet leaders have completed their historically significant visits to India, Burma and Afghanistan. The visit of the Soviet leaders was universally and warmly welcomed by the people of Asian countries, vividly demonstrating the deep friendship between the Soviet people and the people of Asian countries. The people of Asian countries express deep admiration for the Soviet people because the Soviet people have unprecedentedly overthrown the oppressive system and established the most advanced social system; the Soviet Union treats Asian countries on an equal footing, respects the sovereignty and independence of Asian countries, and helps Asian countries build their own economic foundations without attaching any political conditions, in order to get rid of long-term poverty and backwardness. The Asian people sincerely thank the Soviet people for their tireless efforts to strengthen world peace, consolidate and promote friendly cooperation and mutual understanding between countries. And the Asian people urgently need peace in order to develop their economies, improve living conditions, and consolidate the independence of their respective countries. In this way, the unity of the wishes and interests of the Soviet people and the people of Asian countries enables the Soviet people and the Asian people to unite closely and rapidly develop friendly cooperative relations with each other.

    The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has been warmly endorsed and supported by the people of Asian countries and welcomed by all progressive mankind, demonstrating the infinite power of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. This is a great victory for the idea of peaceful coexistence. The joint statements issued by the Soviet Union and the governments of India, Burma and Afghanistan and other agreements conducive to strengthening international cooperation will have a profound impact on the historical process of Asian rejuvenation, promote the development of peaceful cooperation between the people of Asia and the world, and powerfully crack down on colonialism's rule in Asia and its attempts to make a comeback.

    The visit of the Soviet government leaders to Asian countries is obviously not to the taste of Western colonial countries. Many bourgeois reactionary newspapers and politicians in the United States and Britain have continuously published various malicious comments, and even used fabrication and distortion to slander, in an attempt to sow discord between the great friendship between the people of Asian countries and the Soviet people, and to shake the confidence of the people of Asian countries in the principles of international cooperation. However, Western colonial countries have obviously underestimated the degree of awareness of the people of Asian countries. They cannot see or are unwilling to see the huge changes that have taken place in Asian history. Therefore, their various malicious comments cannot only deceive the people of Asian countries, but on the contrary, arouse angry condemnation among the people of various countries. Dulles's statement on supporting Portugal's occupation of Indian territory Goa, which has been fiercely opposed by the people of Asian countries, is an example. However, Western colonial countries will not automatically give up their aggression against Asia. They will also try to undermine the unity of Asian countries, especially to undermine the peaceful cooperation between the people of Asian countries and the Soviet people, in order to continue to enslave the people of Asian countries. The Asian people who love peace and resolutely safeguard their national sovereignty will surely raise their vigilance, cherish their friendship with the Soviet people, and further strengthen international cooperation.

### 苏阿友好合作关系的巩固和加强

    苏阿友好合作关系的巩固和加强
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫，在访问印度、缅甸之后，访问了阿富汗，同阿富汗首相达乌德汗进行了诚恳和友好的谈判，并在十二月十八日就谈判结果发表了联合声明和两国关于经济关系的联合公报。同时，苏阿两国政府全权代表签订了关于延长苏联和阿富汗两国在一九三一年六月二十四日缔结的中立和互不侵犯条约有效期限的议定书。
    苏联政府领袖的访问阿富汗，和两国在爱好和平的睦邻政策指导下所取得的这些重要成就，是在发展苏阿两国人民一贯友好关系中的一个新的巨大步骤，对于巩固亚洲和全世界的和平和进一步缓和国际局势和发扬日内瓦精神，都是一个积极的贡献。
    两国联合声明正确地表达了世界各国人民爱好和平的真诚愿望。它肯定和平共处的五项原则，完全符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，是保证和平和世界各国人民之间的相互谅解的坚实基础。两国政府认为，在日内瓦召开的四国政府首脑会议和随后举行的外长会议，对于缓和国际局势和保证和平产生了积极的结果。因此，双方表示希望这些国家努力争取再次召开类似的会议，以协商解决各国之间的分歧。同时，为稳定世界和平和促进各国之间的谅解，两国认为必须普遍裁军和无条件禁止原子武器，原子能只能用于和平目的，以促进科学的发展和提高人类的生活水平。
    为保障东方地区的和平和安全，苏阿联合声明特别指出：“东方地区目前的情况和紧张局势是对世界和平的一种威胁”；并一致认为，远东一切没有解决的问题，必须为了和平的利益而加以解决；中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位必须恢复；有关中国的问题必须在尊重中国人民的民族权利的情况下得到解决。苏阿两国这种维护和平的明确立场，不但是对中国人民保卫自己国家主权和争取亚洲和平的正义斗争的支持，而且是对东方地区各国人民争取和平和独立斗争的鼓舞。因为，目前东方地区的紧张局势，完全是西方殖民国家的侵略行动所造成的。它们在东方地区组织军事侵略集团，建立军事基地，进行各种侵略活动并粗暴地干涉别国内政，从而严重地威胁着东方地区国家的和平和独立。
    苏阿两国之间的友好关系的加强，是不同政治制度国家之间和平合作的良好榜样。两国关于进一步发展友好合作关系的各项重要文件的签订，再一次证实苏联和阿富汗人民要求友谊、和平和合作的坚决意志。这些文件反映了双方决心采取各种措施，以发展和巩固两国之间的政治、经济和文化方面的更加密切的联系。为实现这一崇高的目标，两国政府商定，今后将继续进行会谈，以便研究进一步进行互利的经济和技术合作的形式，苏联并同意在发展阿富汗经济的工作计划中，给予阿富汗技术援助和贷款形式的财政援助。苏联和阿富汗之间不断扩大的经济联系，对于发展阿富汗的和平经济具有重大的意义；而阿富汗和平经济的发展，是维护和巩固它的民族独立的可靠基础。
    苏联和阿富汗延长两国在一九三一年六月二十四日缔结的中立和互不侵犯条约的有效期限，是两国和平合作和睦邻政策的光辉成就。这有力地证明，只要互相都有和平合作的愿望，彼此尊重对方的独立和主权，各国之间是完全能够和睦相处的。大家知道，苏联和阿富汗之间早就存在着巩固的友好关系。远在一九一九年，阿富汗同殖民者进行了英勇的斗争，获得了自己的独立。苏联是第一个承认阿富汗主权的国家，并且同它建立了正常的外交关系。一九二一年，俄罗斯联邦共和国和阿富汗签订了和平友好关系的条约。这是阿富汗国家历史上的第一个平等条约。一九二六年签订、一九三一年重订的苏联和阿富汗之间关于中立和互不侵犯条约，进一步巩固了两国的睦邻关系。现在苏阿两国决定延长这个条约的有效期限，定将更加促进两国友好合作关系的巩固。
    多少年来，西方殖民者给阿富汗人民带来了惨重的灾害。它们的支配阻碍了阿富汗经济的发展，使阿富汗人民长期过着贫困的生活。但伟大的苏联人民以同情和平等的态度对待阿富汗人民，从各方面帮助阿富汗人民。这次苏联领袖访问阿富汗期间所受到的热烈接待和欢迎，充分地表达了阿富汗政府和人民对它邻邦的友好感情。
    苏联领袖已经完成了他们对印度、缅甸和阿富汗具有历史意义的访问。苏联领袖的这次访问，受到亚洲各国人民普遍的热烈欢迎，生动地表现了苏联人民和亚洲国家人民间的深厚友谊。亚洲各国人民对苏联人民表示深深地敬仰，因为苏联人民史无前例地推翻了压迫制度，建立了最先进的社会制度；苏联以平等地位对待亚洲国家，尊重亚洲国家的主权和独立，不附任何政治条件帮助亚洲国家建设自己的经济基础，以摆脱长期的贫困和落后。亚洲人民衷心地感激苏联人民不倦地努力加强世界和平，巩固和促进各国间的友好合作和互相谅解。而亚洲人民迫切地需要和平，以便发展自己的经济，改善生活条件，巩固各自国家的独立。这样，苏联人民和亚洲各国人民愿望和利益的一致，使苏联人民和亚洲人民能够紧紧地团结起来，并迅速发展相互间的友好合作关系。
    苏联和平外交政策，得到亚洲各国人民的热烈赞同和支持，受到全体进步人类的欢迎，显示了苏联外交政策的无限威力。这是和平共处思想的伟大胜利。苏联同印度、缅甸和阿富汗政府所分别发表的联合声明和其他有助于加强国际合作的各项协议，将对亚洲复兴的历史进程产生深远的影响，促进亚洲和世界各国人民间和平合作的发展，有力地打击殖民主义在亚洲的统治和卷土重来的企图。
    苏联政府领袖这次访问亚洲国家，显然不适合西方殖民国家的胃口。美国和英国许多资产阶级反动报纸和政界人士，不断发表各种各样恶毒的评论，甚至用捏造和歪曲来进行诋毁，企图挑拨离间亚洲国家人民和苏联人民的伟大友谊，动摇亚洲国家人民对国际合作原则的信心。但是，西方殖民国家显然低估了亚洲国家人民的觉悟程度，它们看不到或不愿意看到亚洲历史所发生的巨大变化。因此，它们的各种恶毒的评论，不仅欺骗不了亚洲各国人民，相反地在各国人民中激起了愤怒的斥责。杜勒斯关于支持葡萄牙侵占印度领土果阿的声明，在亚洲各国人民中受到激烈的反对，就是一个例子。但是，西方殖民国家对亚洲的侵略是不会自动放弃的，它们还会要来破坏亚洲各国之间的团结的，特别要破坏亚洲国家人民同苏联人民间的和平合作，以便于它们继续奴役亚洲国家人民。爱好和平和坚决维护自己国家主权的亚洲人民，一定会提高警惕，十分珍视他们和苏联人民的友谊，进一步加强国际合作。
