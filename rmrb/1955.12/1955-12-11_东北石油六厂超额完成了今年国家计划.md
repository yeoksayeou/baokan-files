To the Editor:

Our Northeast Petroleum Factory Six has already exceeded this year's national production plan. As of December 1st, crude oil production has reached 100.2% of the annual plan, an increase of 31.76% over last year's actual production; the labor productivity plan has been completed by 101.9%; single furnace efficiency has increased by 2.6%; oil yield has increased by 2.1%; production costs have been reduced by 13.26% compared to last year; and the profit delivery plan has also been completed.

Northeast Petroleum Factory Six is a coal-to-oil factory with very complex technical conditions and many problems in production. At the beginning of this year, our factory not only could not deliver profits, but also had to rely on state subsidies to maintain production. After studying the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, all employees realized that in order to build a beautiful socialist society, we must increase production, complete and exceed the national plan; and we must also practice strict economy and accumulate construction funds for the country. Therefore, all employees in the factory enthusiastically launched a labor competition, conscientiously promoted advanced experiences such as economic accounting for teams and groups, and carried out work to eliminate oil leakage and loss accidents. After this, the production and quality of oil have been significantly improved, and waste has been greatly reduced. For example, the hydrogen gas cylinder in Workshop Five was leaking, and with the efforts of Li Chengxi, a municipal model worker and section chief, the leak was finally plugged, saving the state more than 1,000 yuan per month. In the past, Workshop Two also had a serious problem of light oil leakage and loss. After the work to eliminate oil leakage and loss accidents was carried out, it recovered more than two tons of light oil per day compared to the past.

While solving key production problems, we also paid attention to improving labor conditions. In the past, the raw material section of the First Workshop had a high temperature and flying dust. Now, the equipment has been improved, and the workers have carefully adjusted the fire, stabilizing the furnace temperature and preventing coking, thus ensuring environmental hygiene and ensuring production.

During the competition, employees also formulated and revised competition conditions in a timely manner, and conducted regular evaluations. This constantly enriched the content of the competition and encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. As a result, young machinists Zheng Yi and Li Liangui completed the annual production plan more than three months ahead of schedule; and the entire machinist team completed ten months of production plan in nine months.

Now, all our employees are continuing to strive to exceed the plan to increase production by 100 tons of crude oil within the year!

### 东北石油六厂超额完成了今年国家计划

    东北石油六厂超额完成了今年国家计划编辑同志：
    我们东北石油六厂已经超额完成了今年国家的生产计划。到十二月一日，原油产量已经完成全年计划的百分之一百点二，比去年实际产量提高了百分之三十一点七六；劳动生产率计划完成了百分之一百零一点九；单炉效率提高了百分之二点六；出油率提高了百分之二点一；生产成本比去年降低了百分之十三点二六；上缴利润计划也完成了。
    东北石油六厂是个煤炼油工厂，技术条件非常复杂，生产中的问题很多。在今年年初，我们这个厂子不但不能上缴利润，而且还要依靠国家的补贴来维持生产。经过学习发展国民经济的第一个五年计划以后，全体职工认识到，为了建设美好的社会主义社会，我们必须增加生产，完成并超额完成国家计划；还要厉行节约，为国家积累建设资金。因此，全厂职工热烈地开展了劳动竞赛，认真推广了班、组经济核算等先进经验，开展了消灭漏油损油事故的工作。在这以后，石油的产量和质量就有了显著的提高，浪费现象也大大减少了。例如，五车间氢气大缸漏气，在市劳动模范、工段长李承喜的努力下，终于堵住了漏洞，每月给国家节约一千多元。二车间从前跑损轻油的现象也很严重，在消灭漏油损油事故的工作开展以后，每天就比过去多收回两吨多轻油。
    在解决生产上的关键问题的同时，我们也注意到改善劳动条件。第一车间原料工段过去温度很高，灰尘飞扬，现在改进了设备，再加上工人们认真地调火，使炉温稳定，防止了挂焦现象，因而就保证了环境卫生，保证了生产。
    在竞赛过程中，职工们还及时地制定和修改了竞赛条件，并且定期进行评比。这就不断地丰富了竞赛内容，鼓舞了职工们的劳动热情。青年车工郑义和李莲桂等因此都提前三个多月完成了全年生产计划；车工全班就用九个月的时间完成了十个月的生产计划。
    现在，我们全体职工正为在年内超额完成增产一百吨原油的计划而继续奋斗！
