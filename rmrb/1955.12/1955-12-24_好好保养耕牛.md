Since the beginning of winter, the number of draught cattle deaths in Guangdong has gradually increased. In Pingshi District, Lechang County, 109 draught cattle died in the past year, and in the ten days after the beginning of winter, 25 draught cattle died in succession. In Shuibei and Chaozhen Townships of Heping County, four draught cattle died in two days. It is worth noting that the phenomenon of draught cattle deaths mostly occurs within agricultural producers' cooperatives. For example, three of the four draught cattle that died in Chaozhen and Shuibei Townships belonged to agricultural producers' cooperatives.

The main reason for the deaths of draught cattle is the lack of proper care and management after the draught cattle joined the cooperatives. According to an inspection in Pingshi District, Lechang County, only four of the 25 draught cattle that died there froze to death due to the cold wave. The others died due to poor care, being accidentally killed, food poisoning, overwork, or being attacked by tigers.

Draught cattle are the main source of power in current agricultural production. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions should quickly establish a system for raising and managing draught cattle, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for raising draught cattle well.

    好好保养耕牛
    入冬以来，广东的耕牛死亡数量逐渐增加。乐昌县坪石区，在过去的一年中，死亡耕牛一百零九头，而立冬后的十天，就接连死亡耕牛二十五头。和平县的水背、超镇两乡，两天时间死亡耕牛四头。值得注意的是：耕牛死亡现象多发生在农业生产合作社内，像超镇、水背两乡死亡的四头耕牛，就有三头是农业生产合作社的。
    耕牛死亡的主要原因，是耕牛入社后缺乏妥善的保养管理。据乐昌县坪石区检查，他们那里死亡的二十五头耕牛中，因寒流来袭而冻死的只有四头，其他都是因为照料不好，或被摔死，或食物中毒而死，或累病而死，或被老虎咬死。
    耕牛，是当前农业生产中的主要动力。各地农业生产合作社，应该赶快建立起饲养管理耕牛的制度，设专人负责，把耕牛喂养好。
