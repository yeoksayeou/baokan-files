    Strange Business Practices

    The Heping Road Store of the Tianjin Municipal Department Store is the largest state-owned store in Tianjin. Every day, tens of thousands of customers want to go inside to buy things, but many people cannot buy what they want.

    Take buying woolen sweaters as an example. People with larger builds cannot find them. The colors of the sweaters are only bright red and blue. If you want to buy white, pale yellow, or lilac, they are not available.

    The Heping Road Store has also had such strange occurrences: some salespeople, fearing that having too many varieties of goods would make selling and settling accounts too troublesome, simply hid the goods and refused to sell them. For example, in October, a salesperson at the daily necessities counter on the second floor saw that white sewing thread and embroidery thread were not worth much money and did not have much impact on completing the sales target, so they hid these goods behind the counter and prevented customers from seeing them. If customers asked, they would answer "We don't have it!" Not only was it like this at the daily necessities counter, but it was also like this with the salespeople selling radios. In October, the counter selling "Worker-Peasant Friend" brand radios originally displayed radios with various different landscape paintings, but the salespeople, disliking customers picking and choosing patterns, found it troublesome for them to keep picking and choosing. So every day, they only sold one type of pattern.

    The store's salespeople are unwilling to stock more goods, believing that having only one type of the same commodity is enough. Seeing that the goods are sold out, they are still unwilling to quickly replenish them.

    In this light, it is not surprising that customers cannot buy what they want. Because the salespeople have forgotten that state-owned commercial workers must meet the needs of consumers to the greatest extent possible, and only focus on saving trouble. Can such business practices still be tolerated?

    奇怪的经营作风
    天津市百货公司和平路商店，是天津最大的国营商店。每天总有上万顾客要进去买东西，但是有很多人买不到称心货。
    拿买绒衣来说吧，身材大的就买不到。绒衣的颜色只有大红、蓝色的，要想买白色、鹅黄色、青莲色的就没有。
    在和平路商店还有过这样的怪事：有的售货员害怕商品品种多了，卖货、结账太麻烦，就索性把商品藏起来不卖。例如十月里中二楼的日用品柜上有一个售货员，看货柜里白轴线和绣花线不值几个钱，对完成推销计划关系不大，就把这些商品藏在货柜的后边，不让顾客看到。要是顾客询问，他就回答“没有！”不仅日用品柜如此，卖收音机的售货员也如此，十月份出卖“工农之友”牌收音机的货柜里本来陈列着有多种不同风景画的收音机，可是售货员嫌顾客挑选花色，挑来挑去麻烦，每天只卖一种花色的。
    这个商店的售货员不愿多提货，认为同样的商品有一种就行了。看到货销光了，还不愿赶快提货。
    这样看来，顾客买不到称心货也就不奇怪了。因为售货员已经忘了国营商业工作者必须最大限度地满足消费者的需要，而只贪图省事。这种经营作风难道还能容许吗？
