    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: The Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on December 27th opposing the South Vietnamese regime's preparations to hold unilateral elections.
    The statement said that after Ngo Dinh Diem, through a deceptive "referendum," proclaimed himself president, he is now preparing to stage a unilateral "election" farce to establish a so-called "National Assembly" of South Vietnam and formulate a so-called "Constitution of the Vietnamese State."
    The statement pointed out that this unilateral "election" farce is part of an American conspiracy, the conspiracy being to divide Vietnam for a long time, exclude France, and turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of American imperialism. The statement said that this unilateral "election" is in complete violation of the Geneva Accords.
    The Vietnam Fatherland Front declares that the unilateral "election" that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is preparing to implement in the South is illegal.
    The Vietnam Fatherland Front calls on the people of North and South Vietnam and overseas compatriots to unite closely, resolutely oppose the new conspiracy of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem, and resolutely oppose the unilateral "election" in the South.
    The Vietnam Fatherland Front appeals to the people of the world to actively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, so that the Geneva Agreements on Indochina can be thoroughly implemented and the peace of Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world can be consolidated.

    越南祖国战线发表声明反对南越片面选举
    新华社河内二十七日电　越南祖国战线十二月二十七日发表反对南越政权准备举行片面选举的声明。
    声明说，吴庭艳在进行欺骗的“公民投票”自封为总统以后，目前正在准备组织片面“选举”丑剧，以成立所谓越南南方的“国会”和制定所谓“越南国家宪法”。
    声明指出，这个片面“选举”丑剧是美国阴谋的一部分，美国的阴谋是长期分割越南，排挤法国，把越南南方变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。声明说，这个片面“选举”是完全违反日内瓦协定的。
    越南祖国战线声明，吴庭艳政权正在准备在南方实行的片面“选举”是非法的。
