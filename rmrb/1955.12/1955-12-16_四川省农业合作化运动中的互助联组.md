Mutual Aid and Cooperative Groups in Sichuan Province's Agricultural Cooperation Movement
Li Chao

This year, mutual aid and cooperative groups played a significant role in Sichuan Province's agricultural cooperation movement. Mutual aid and cooperative groups prepared favorable conditions for agricultural producers' cooperatives, ensuring the quality of newly established cooperatives. The more than 30,000 cooperatives established throughout the province (including Xikang) before spring plowing this year have been basically consolidated and have achieved increased production, generally by about 5 to 30 percent, largely because they were developed from mutual aid and cooperative groups. The average wheat yield of agricultural producers' cooperatives is more than 30 percent higher than the provincial average.

More than 25,000 new cooperatives were established throughout the province before and after this year's autumn harvest. These cooperatives were also mostly established on the basis of mutual aid and cooperative groups. Because they had the habit of working together and preliminary experience in management and administration, production was relatively easy to bring into normal order after the cooperatives were established. In Wenjiang Prefecture, the more than 2,700 new cooperatives established before autumn harvest divided production areas on the basis of the original mutual aid and cooperative group production teams (groups) after their establishment, and rushed to plant a season of late autumn crops, overfulfilling the production plan. Many cooperatives also did not find the initial production investment difficult because they had accumulated public property within the mutual aid and cooperative groups.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the enthusiasm of mutual aid and cooperative groups in Sichuan to actively establish cooperatives became even higher. Eighty percent of the province's mutual aid and cooperative groups applied to establish cooperatives. In Yibin Prefecture, many cooperative groups wrote applications on red paper, with the members writing their names, affixing their seals and fingerprints, expressing their determination to join the cooperative. More than 1,500 cooperative groups in Liangping County also bought popular books on running agricultural producers' cooperatives from the local Xinhua Bookstore for study. More than 450 cooperative groups in Pi County prepared candidates for the cooperative's leadership and accounting positions in order to establish cooperatives.

Within the mutual aid and cooperative groups, the enthusiasm for production was also particularly high in anticipation of establishing cooperatives. In Qingjiang District, Bazhong County, 95 cooperative groups manufactured 20,000 jin of granular fertilizer and shoveled 5,000 jin of turf to make green manure in seven days. In some cooperative groups in Jiangbei County, members planted the three large characters "Welcoming the Cooperative Pond" with liriope grass on the bank of the newly built pond. In order to learn from the experience of cooperative management and administration, many cooperative groups often visited cooperatives and "sought advice and friends" in the cooperatives.

In order to prepare for establishing cooperatives, many cooperative groups also made some material preparations. In Yanggong Township, Shuangliu County, the public property accumulated by 27 cooperative groups in August and September included 26 threshing machines, more than 130 drying mats, 191 pigs, and 18 head of draft cattle. In addition to making material preparations, Chen Youqian's cooperative group in Hancun Township, Gong County, also registered the number of mu of farmland. The members said: We are ready in every way, waiting only for the branch to approve the establishment of the cooperative.

The mutual aid and cooperative groups in Sichuan Province are formed by voluntarily uniting several surrounding mutual aid groups based on production needs, with a relatively good perennial mutual aid group as the core. This organizational form has been around for four years in Sichuan Province.

The Wuji Fa Mutual Aid Cooperative Group in Xiuchuan Village, Jintang County, was one of the earliest to appear. At that time, there were seven mutual aid groups in Xiuchuan Village. In addition to the perennial mutual aid group led by Wu Jifa, the other six temporary mutual aid groups lacked experience in mutual aid and cooperation and hoped to learn some methods from the perennial mutual aid group. However, there was little contact between the mutual aid groups at that time. Everyone then studied the method of holding joint group meetings to learn from each other and exchange experiences. Later, joint meetings of mutual aid group leaders were held regularly on the 5th and 10th of each month. Problems that could not be solved by each group were brought to the meeting for research and solution. At the same time, each group also uniformly allocated manpower, livestock, and farm tools according to production needs and the principle of voluntariness, uniting and helping each other to overcome difficulties in production and life. Each mutual aid group in this type of mutual aid cooperative group still operated independently, and it did not appear as a form of transition to an agricultural producers' cooperative. However, its advantage is that it is easily accepted by general mutual aid groups and can consolidate the original mutual aid groups with weak leadership.

From 1952, mutual aid and cooperative groups gradually developed. By the spring of 1954, after the general task of the state during the transition period was widely publicized in rural areas, mutual aid groups developed in large numbers. At this time, the leading organs summarized the advantages of mutual aid and cooperative groups and promoted them, and a large number of mutual aid and cooperative groups were generally developed in various places. By the end of the same year, there were more than 40,000 mutual aid and cooperative groups throughout the province. With the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, mutual aid and cooperative groups entered a new stage under the guidance of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

At this time, the mutual aid and cooperative group had actually become a large group, and the original mutual aid groups had become the production teams of the cooperative group. Many cooperative groups also tried out small-scale contracting and collective operation of public land, and individual cooperative groups also tried out a small amount of land shares. The phenomenon of accumulating public property was also more common within the cooperative group. At this time, the mutual aid and cooperative group had become a form of transition to an agricultural producers' cooperative.

Mutual aid and cooperative groups have more superior conditions than general mutual aid groups. Through the activities of the cooperative group, a foundation was laid for establishing cooperatives in all aspects.

First, mutual aid and cooperative groups are training classes for training key personnel for establishing cooperatives. In the mutual aid and cooperative groups, the key forces of each mutual aid group are concentrated. One or two stronger group leaders can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and effectively adjust and strengthen the leadership of the original mutual aid groups. At the same time, because the key personnel are concentrated and the scope of mutual aid is expanded, it is possible to carry out division of labor and increase new leading key personnel. Some cooperative groups have production committee members, sideline committee members, women's committee members, public security committee members, cultural and educational committee members, production team leaders, and recorders, which are produced to meet new needs. In this way, on the one hand, a cadre structure for establishing cooperatives is built in the cooperative group; at the same time, their management and administration capabilities are cultivated in practical work. Before autumn this year, most of the key personnel of the 94 new cooperatives established in Shuangliu County were cultivated in mutual aid and cooperative groups.

Second, mutual aid and cooperative groups can carry out basic construction such as farmland water conservancy, and enhance the group members' habit of collective production. Before the establishment of the Li Runan Mutual Aid Cooperative Group in Bazhong County, several mutual aid groups planned to install liberation-style waterwheels in 1952 to draw water from the Ba River for irrigation. However, at that time, each group had limited manpower and financial resources, and no one took the lead in setting up the project. Everyone was worried that disputes would occur between the groups due to water use, so it was delayed for a year and a half. After the establishment of the cooperative group in the spring of 1954, everyone discussed it and completed the installation in less than half a month. The group members further realized the benefits of collective production and actively strived to establish cooperatives as soon as possible.

Third, mutual aid and cooperative groups have accumulated some experience in management and administration. More than 13,000 mutual aid and cooperative groups in Wenjiang Prefecture have now implemented small-scale contracting and improved the scoring and recording methods. In the cooperative groups that lease public land, they also learn from the practice of cooperatives and have gained preliminary experience in investment, distribution, division of production areas, and allocation of labor. Therefore, after the transition to cooperatives, not only the cooperative director and team leader have certain management skills, but the members have also developed some habits of collective management.

Fourth, mutual aid and cooperative groups have established some public management undertakings and accumulated some public property. Because the cooperative group has relatively sufficient material and human resources, it can accumulate more public property than general mutual aid groups. The methods for cooperative groups to establish public management undertakings and accumulate public property are: leasing public land, processing and creating "high-yield fields"; collectively managing water mills; developing mulberry planting and silkworm breeding, fish farming, and other production according to local conditions; collectively reclaiming wasteland and filling in abandoned ditches to increase cultivated land area; and engaging in transportation and other sideline industries during the slack season. At present, most mutual aid and cooperative groups throughout the province have accumulated some public property, more or less.

At present, mutual aid groups and individual farmers still account for a large proportion in Sichuan Province. Due to the above-mentioned advantages of mutual aid and cooperative groups, the local party committees of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province have decided to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative groups and combine the development of mutual aid and cooperative groups with the overall plan for cooperation. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated an implementation plan for agricultural cooperation in the province for the next six months. Based on the plan to establish new cooperatives in the autumn of next year, it was decided that from December this year to May next year, more than 100,000 new mutual aid and cooperative groups will be developed throughout the province. And it is required that all localities conduct detailed planning on the consolidation, improvement, when to transfer to cooperatives, and how to transfer to cooperatives of mutual aid and cooperative groups. In this way, the leaders can have a clear understanding, and the masses can also have a clear goal to strive for.

    四川省农业合作化运动中的互助联组
    李朝
    今年，在四川省的农业合作化运动中，互助联组发挥了巨大的作用。互助联组为农业生产合作社准备了良好的条件，保证了新建社的质量。全省（包括西康在内）今年春耕前建立的三万多个社，由于大部分是由互助联组发展起来的，现在都基本上巩固下来，并且得到了增产，一般都增产百分之五到三十左右。农业生产合作社的小麦平均产量高出全省平均产量三成以上。
    全省今年秋收前后新建了二万五千多个社，这些社也大多是在互助联组的基础上建立的，由于有了共同劳动的习惯和初步经营管理的经验，社建立以后，生产就比较容易纳入正常秩序。温江专区秋前新建的二千七百多个社，建立以后，就在原有互助联组的生产队（组）基础上，划区生产，抢种了一季晚秋作物，超额完成了生产计划。许多社还由于在互助联组内积累了公共财产，头一年的生产底垫也不感到困难。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告公布后，四川各地互助联组积极办社的热情更加高涨。全省百分之八十的互助联组都申请建社。宜宾专区不少联组用红纸写申请书，组员们写上自己的姓名，按上图章、指纹，表示要求入社的决心。梁平县一千五百多个联组，还向当地新华书店买了办农业生产合作社的通俗书籍，进行学习。郫县四百五十多个联组为了建社，都准备好了社里的领导人员和会计的人选。
    互助联组内为迎接建社，生产劲头也特别高。巴中县清江区九十五个联组，在七天内就制造了两万斤颗粒肥料，铲了五千斤草皮沤制青肥。在江北县有的联组内，组员们在新修的大塘边，用麦冬草栽上“迎社塘”三个大字。不少联组为了学习合作社的经营管理经验，经常去参观访问合作社，到合作社内“投师访友”。
    为了迎接办社，许多联组还做了一些物质准备。双流县杨公乡二十七个联组，八、九两个月内积累的公共财产，就有打谷机二十六部，晒席一百三十多床，猪一百九十一只，耕牛十八头。珙县汉村乡陈友乾联组除了做好物质准备外，还把田土亩数也登记好了。组员们说：我们万事齐备，只等支部批准建社了。
    四川省的互助联组是以一个较好的常年互助组为核心，根据生产需要，自愿联合周围几个互助组而组成的。这种组织形式，在四川省已经有四年的历史。
    金堂县秀川村邬纪发互助联组，是最早出现的一个。当时秀川村共有七个互助组，除了邬纪发领导的常年互助组外，其余六个临时互助组都缺乏互助合作的经验，希望向常年互助组学些办法。可是当时互助组之间还很少联系。大家便研究出用召开联组会的办法，来互相学习，交流经验。后来每月逢五逢十的日子定期召开互助组组长联席会，各组有不能解决的问题，都拿到会上研究，加以解决。同时各组也根据生产需要和自愿原则，统一调配人力、畜力和农具，团结互助，共同克服生产、生活上的困难。这种互助联组内的各个互助组仍独立活动，它还不是作为过渡到农业生产合作社的形式而出现的。但是它的好处是容易为一般互助组所接受，并且能巩固原有领导薄弱的互助组。
    从一九五二年起，互助联组就逐步发展起来。到一九五四年春天，国家在过渡时期的总任务在农村中大张旗鼓宣传以后，互助组更有了大量发展。这时，领导机关总结了互助联组的好处，加以推广，各地就普遍发展了一批互助联组。同年年底前，全省互助联组已经达四万多个。随着农业合作化运动的发展，互助联组在农业生产合作社带动下进入了新的阶段。
    这时，互助联组实际上已经成为一个大组，原来的各个互助组都变成了联组的生产队。许多联组还试行了小包工、集体经营公田，个别的联组还试行了小量土地入股。积累公共财产的现象在联组内也较普遍。这时的互助联组已经成为过渡到农业生产合作社的一种形式。
    互助联组比一般互助组具备更多的优越条件，通过联组的活动，就在各方面为建社打下了基础。
    首先，互助联组是训练建社骨干的训练班。在互助联组内由于集中各互助组的骨干力量，其中有一两个较强的组长，就能取长补短，以强带弱，有效地调剂和加强原有互助组的领导力量。同时由于骨干集中，互助范围扩大，就有可能进行分工，增加新的领导骨干。有的联组内设有生产委员、副业委员、妇女委员、治安委员、文教委员和生产队长、记分员等，就是适应新的需要而产生的。这样，一方面在联组内搭好了建社的干部架子；同时在实际工作中培养了他们经营管理的能力。今年秋前，双流县新建九十四个社的主要骨干，大部分是互助联组中培养出来的。
    第二，互助联组能兴办农田水利等基本建设，增强组员集体生产的习惯。巴中县李如楠互助联组成立前的几个互助组，在一九五二年就打算安装解放式水车，从巴河车水灌田。但是那时各组人力、财力有限，又没人带头兴办，大家又顾虑组和组会因为用水发生争执，因此拖了一年半没做。一九五四年春天成立联组后，大家一合计，动工不到半月就安装好了。组员们进一步认识集体生产的好处，都积极争取早日建社。
    第三，互助联组积累了一些经营管理的经验。温江专区一万三千多个互助联组，目前大部推行了小包工，改进了评分记工办法。租种公田的联组内，还学习社的做法，在投资、分配、划区生产、调配劳动力等方面都取得初步经验。因此，转社后不仅社长、队长有一定的管理能力，社员们也已经有一些集体经营的习惯。
    第四，互助联组举办了一些公共经营事业，积累部分公共财产。由于联组内物力、人力比较充足，就能比一般互助组多积累公共财产。联组举办公共经营事业，积累公共财产的方法有：租种公田，加工创造“丰产田”；集体经营水碾、水磨；因地制宜发展植桑养蚕、养鱼等生产；集体开荒和填平废沟，增加耕地面积；在农闲期间进行运输等副业。目前，全省互助联组大都或多或少积累了一些公共财产。
    目前四川全省互助组和单干农民还占很大比重。由于互助联组具有上述的优点，中共四川省各地党委都决定加强对互助联组的领导，把互助联组的发展同合作化全面规划结合起来。最近，中共四川省委员会制定了全省今后半年的农业合作化实施方案中，就根据明年秋季新建社的计划，决定在今年十二月到明年五月期间，全省要新发展十几万个互助联组。并且要求各地对互助联组的巩固、提高、何时转社、怎样转社等问题都进行详细的规划。这样，可以使领导心中有数，也使群众摸底，有明确的奋斗目标。
