Czechoslovakian Prints
　　Lǐ Huá

The "Exhibition of Czechoslovakian Republic Fine Arts" featured over four hundred works. These artworks summarized the various historical stages of the development of Czechoslovakian fine arts from the 13th century until after liberation, encompassing genres like oil painting, sculpture, prints, cartoons, and propaganda posters. This is the first time such a comprehensive introduction of Czechoslovakian fine arts has come to China. It is a good opportunity for us to understand the overall picture of Czechoslovakian fine arts.

Here, I would like to discuss the print section of the exhibition.

In all the print works exhibited this time, some focus on depicting nature, filled with the artist's emotions and imagination, while others are closely connected to real life and struggle, truthfully reflecting society. Whether the former or the latter, they clearly show that the development direction of Czechoslovakian prints today is based on the original tradition of realism, advancing towards socialist realism by leaps and bounds.

Speaking of the older generation of printmakers, we should first introduce the eighty-two-year-old Švabinský. The Czechoslovak people deeply respect this old painter. In his long creative life, he created many excellent paintings for the people, ranging from murals to stamp designs. He is especially good at printmaking, such as etching, woodcut, lithograph, pen and ink, watercolor, etc., and what is most beloved is his portrait painting. He meticulously portrays progressive artists and scientists of the previous generation and contemporaries with sincere respect and noble feelings—such as the portraits of composer Smetana, poet Neruda, historian Palacký, and the founder of Czech painting in the nineteenth century, Jo. Manes, exhibited this time. He successfully expresses the characters of different figures perfectly and profoundly through image portrayal, possessing a high degree of artistry.

Poetry and imagination are one of the characteristics of Švabinský's single prints. Take "Midday in June," exhibited this time, as an example: In order to express the mood of people obtaining a happy life from a good harvest, the author does not make a superficial description of life but, through imagination, like a lyrical poem, paints a healthy and beautiful woman soaring over a vast field of wheat with heavy ears, holding a sickle in her right hand, her left arm shading her forehead, the dazzling sunlight cheerfully shining on the world, arousing boundless joy in the viewer. The woman, as a symbol of harvest, leads us to generate many rich associations with life significance. After seeing this painting, we truly feel like we are hearing a sweet song praising life. Švabinský's prints are not simple narratives of the reality of life, they are beautiful poems, such as "Morning Hunt" and "Illustrations for Viktor Dyk's Poems."

Poetry is also expressed in the landscape paintings of other authors, such as the many colorful etching prints with poetry by the four old printmakers in their seventies: Stroff, Mayer, Vondrouš, and Stroff-Šamberk. These landscape prints have an alluring power, not only truthfully portraying the face of nature but also conveying the feeling of the beauty of nature. Stroff-Šamberk's three snow scenes, through the depiction of wind and snow, make the ordinary chapel, skating rink, and castle scenery appear extraordinarily beautiful. Stroff's "Evening on the Vltava River in Prague" expresses the scenery of the Vltava River from dusk, especially moving the horizon very high, focusing on expressing the quiet river reflecting the evening glow, setting off the city of Prague as extraordinarily poetic and beautiful. Mayer's "Winter Village" uses the contrast between the gray sky and the white snow, as well as the image of people and horses shrinking back, to express the severe cold climate. These old printmakers are even more skilled at using different compositions to adapt to various themes and content. For example, in order to comprehensively express the activities of people in the square, Vondrouš adopted a bird's-eye view composition in "The Square of Turnov," while in another work, "The White Tower of Klatovy," in order to emphasize the tallness of the white tower building, he especially lowered the horizon on the vertically long screen. In order to correct the tendency of generalization of composition in our printmaking creation, we have the necessity to humbly learn composition skills from here.

We should also mention another old printmaker, Rambousek, whose woodcuts profoundly reflect the lives of the working people. "Football Fans" exhibited this time is a thought-provoking work, depicting ordinary citizens who are busy with life but love sports, standing on the fence, watching the game with relish. The stadium does not appear in the picture, but through the absorbed posture of these "football fans," the reader seems to see a wonderful game in tense progress. The author creatively handled this theme and successfully expressed the life of ordinary citizens in general. Another work, "Lumberjacks," is also a good work depicting the lives of working people.

The works of younger printmakers strongly express the life and struggle of the people. Hološník's lithographic series "Uprising" (six of the series were exhibited this time) powerfully depicts the great uprising of the Slovak people in the autumn of 1944. Although that popular uprising was not completely successful, it shook the reactionary rule of German fascism, gave great help to the Soviet Red Army, and became the foundation for the victory of Czechoslovakia's liberation in 1945. In these paintings, Hološník expresses the strength of the people in persevering in the battle in that great uprising, the spirit of fighting together and helping each other, and generous martyrdom, a lofty patriotic ideology, infecting every audience through these colorful and bold pictures. Hučíko's etching "Struggle for Freedom" is a powerful work with the same theme as "Uprising," with strong black and white contrast and rich tones, expressing the excited crowd, responding to the call of the Communist Party, gathering in the square to prepare for the uprising. Doubrava's woodcut "Uprising" is also a work depicting this great event.

Other woodcuts with the theme of the anti-fascist war include Klima's "Help for the Guerrillas," "Wounded," "Before the Battle," Balaš's "Battle on Hill 1062," and Štech's "Liberation of Southern Bohemia." Štech's woodcut uses meticulous and bold lines to portray the moving scene of the people presenting flowers to the Soviet Red Army that liberated Southern Bohemia.

Prints depicting the general life of the people include Rehaek's "Harvest in Peace Time," Král's "Girl from Bohoronice," Fiala's "Farmer's Home," Foldráška's "Farmer from Stare," and Smetana's "Picking Potatoes," which can all express the living characteristics of the Czechoslovak people, with a strong national style.

Among the young printmakers, there are also some landscape painters whose skills are no less than their predecessors, creating many excellent landscape paintings. For example, Šífko's "Landscape of Deštné" and Konoploc's "Pond in the Evening," etc., are all etching landscapes with a high degree of artistry. But we would like to see more prints reflecting the new life, because they will allow us to see the face of this era. We warmly hope to have the opportunity to see more such works.

    捷克斯洛伐克的版画　
    李桦
    “捷克斯洛伐克共和国造型艺术展览会”展出了四百多件作品。这些艺术品概括了从十三世纪直到解放后的捷克斯洛伐克造型艺术发展的各个历史阶段，而种类则包括了油画、雕塑、版画、漫画和宣传画等。像这样全面地介绍捷克斯洛伐克的造型艺术到中国来，这还是第一次。这是我们认识捷克斯洛伐克造型艺术全貌的一个好机会。
    在这里，我想谈谈展览会中的版画部分。
    在这次展出的全部版画作品中，有的以描写大自然为主，充满了艺术家的感情和想像，有的紧密地结合着现实的生活和斗争，真实地反映社会。不论前者或是后者，它们都清楚地显示出：今天捷克斯洛伐克版画的发展方向是以原有的现实主义的传统为基础，向着社会主义现实主义大踏步地前进。
    谈到老一辈的版画家，我们应当首先介绍八十二岁高龄的诗伐宾斯基。捷克斯洛伐克人民十分敬爱这位老画家。在他的长期创作生活中，他为人民创作了大至壁画、小至邮票设计的许多优秀的画幅。他更擅长版画，如腐蚀版画、木刻、石版画、钢笔画、水彩画等，而最使人喜爱的是他的肖像画。他用衷心的敬意和崇高的感情来细致刻划前一代的和同时代的进步艺术家和科学家们——如这次展出的作曲家斯美坦那、诗人聂鲁达、历史家巴拉斯基，十九世纪捷克绘画的奠基者约·马内斯等的肖像，都成功地通过形象的刻划，完美而深刻地表现出不同人物的性格，而具有高度的艺术性。
    富有诗意和想像力，是诗伐宾斯基单幅版画的特点之一。试举这次展出的“六月的中午”来作例证：为了表现人民由丰收而获得美满生活的意境，作者不作生活表面的描写，而通过想像，像一首抒情诗似的，画出一个在广阔的结穗累累的麦田上空翱翔着的健美的女性，右手拿着镰刀，左臂遮在额上，耀目的阳光正愉快地普照着人间，使观者生出无限欢欣的感情。那作为丰收象征的女性，引导我们产生许多丰富的具有生活意义的联想。看了这幅画，我们真像听到一首甘美的赞美生活的诗歌一样。诗伐宾斯基的版画，不是简单的生活现实的叙述，它是优美的诗，如“晨猎”、“维克多·意柯·巴卡斯诗的插画”等，都是这样。
    诗意也表现在其余作者的风景画中，例如斯特洛底、马叶尔、封德罗许和斯特洛底萨姆波尼这四位七十多岁的老版画家的许多画中有诗的彩色腐蚀版画。这些风景版画具有诱人的力量，不仅真实地刻划出大自然的面貌，而且传达出大自然美的感情。斯特洛底萨姆波尼的三幅雪景，通过对于风雪的描绘，使寻常的礼拜堂、溜冰场、城堡的风景显得格外美化了。斯特洛底的“晚上在布拉格伏尔达瓦河上”，从黄昏时候去表现伏尔达瓦河的风光，特别把视平线移得很高，着重地表现反映着晚霞的静静的河水，衬托出布拉格城格外富有诗意而美丽。马叶尔的“冬日的乡村”则运用灰色的天空同白色的雪地相对照以及人马畏缩的形象，表现出严寒的气候。这几位老版画家更善于运用不同的构图来适应各种主题内容，例如封德罗许为了全面地表现广场中人物的活动，在“杜尔诺夫城的广场”中采用了俯瞰的构图，而在另一幅“克拉多费城的白塔”中，为了强调白塔楼房的崇高，在竖长的画面上特别将视平线降得很低。为了纠正我们版画创作中构图一般化的倾向，我们有虚心地从这里学习构图技巧的必要。
    我们还要提到另一位老版画家拉姆波塞克，他的木刻深刻地反映了劳动人民的生活。这次展出的“球迷”是一幅令人寻味的作品，表现的是：忙于生活却热爱体育运动的普通市民，站在栅栏上，津津有味地看着球赛。球场并没有出现在画面中，我们通过这几个“球迷”出神的体态，却使读者好似亲眼看见正在紧张进行中的一场精彩的球赛。作者创造性地处理了这个题材，而且成功地表现了一般普通市民的生活。另一幅“伐木者”也是描写劳动人民生活的佳作。
    较年轻的版画家们的作品，强烈地表现出人民的生活和斗争。霍洛士尼克的石版组画“起义”（此次展出了组画中的六幅），有力地描写了一九四四年秋有名的斯洛伐克人民的伟大起义。那次人民起义，虽然没有完全成功，但是撼动了德国法西斯的反动统治，给予苏联红军以很大的帮助，成为一九四五年捷克斯洛伐克解放胜利的基础。霍洛士尼克在这些画幅中，表现了人民在那次伟大起义中坚持战斗的力量，奋战互助、慷慨就义的精神，一种崇高的爱国主义思想，通过这些颜色浓重、线条粗壮的各个画面感染着每一个观众。胡契柯的腐蚀版画“为自由而斗争”是和“起义”同一主题的力作，强烈的黑白对比和丰富的色调，表现了激动着的人群，正响应着共产党的号召，聚集广场作起义的斗争准备。杜白埃的木刻“起义”也是描写这次伟大事件的作品。
    其他以反法西斯战争为题材的木刻，还有克里马的“给游击队的帮助”、“负伤”、“战斗之前”，巴拉许的“在一○六二高地的战斗”，以及史得霍的“波希米亚南部的解放”等。史得霍这幅木刻用缜密而粗壮的线条刻划出人民向解放波希米亚南部的苏联红军献花的动人场面。
    描写一般人民生活的版画有雷海夫的“和平时候的收割”，克拉尔的“来自波何罗尼的姑娘”，非阿拉的“农民的家”，佛得拉许卡的“来自史达尔的农民”，斯美塔克的“拾洋芋”等，都能表现出捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活特点，具有强烈的民族风格。
    在青年版画家中，也有一些技术不亚于前辈的风景画家，创作了许多优秀的风景画。如希夫柯的
  “德什波尼的风景”，柯诺普洛胡的“傍晚的池沼”等腐蚀风景版画，都是具有高度艺术性的。但是我们却喜欢看到更多反映新生活的版画，因为它们会让我们看到这个时代的面貌。我们热烈希望能有机会更多地看到这样的作品。（附图片）球迷拉姆波塞克作起义　霍洛士尼克作
