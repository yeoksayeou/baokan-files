Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The State Council issued instructions on December 22nd regarding the pre-purchase of cotton for 1956. It requires the People's Committees of all cotton-producing provinces and cities to arrange the pre-purchase of cotton in conjunction with the upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement and the overall planning of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production.

The instructions pointed out: The pre-purchase of cotton in 1955 involved pre-purchasing all commodity cotton from cotton farmers based on the unified purchase task. The state not only provided farmers with deposits when signing pre-purchase contracts, but also offered preferential supplies of a certain amount of material goods. If cotton farmers overfulfilled their contracts, they could still receive preferential material supplies for the over-sold portion. Facts have proven that these measures are correct. They not only guided farmers to produce according to state plans, ensuring the completion of the state's unified purchase task, but also the advance payment of deposits and the preferential supply of materials effectively solved the difficulties of cotton farmers in production and life, and promoted the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. Therefore, the pre-purchase work is deeply welcomed by farmers. In addition, due to the late arrangement of the cotton pre-purchase work in 1955, some shortcomings were also produced in the pre-purchase work. This year, improvements should be made in the work.

The instructions require continued implementation of the unified purchase policy for cotton, promoting increased cotton production through pre-purchase methods, and ensuring the completion of the state's purchase tasks. All cotton produced in 1956, except for the cotton retained by cotton farmers for their own use and the agricultural tax in cotton collected by the state, will be subject to unified purchase by the state. Pre-purchase should be carried out in all concentrated cotton-producing areas.

The instructions stipulate that in order to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers in production and encourage cotton farmers to produce and sell cotton according to the state plan, deposits should be paid to cotton farmers when signing pre-purchase contracts. At the same time, for every dan (approximately 50 kg) of ginned cotton pre-sold by cotton farmers, in addition to the quota for unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton cloth, an additional 10 jin (approximately 5 kg) of grain and 10 chi (approximately 3.3 meters) of cotton cloth will be supplied, as well as 50 to 100 jin of oilseed cake fertilizer (1 jin of chemical fertilizer is equivalent to 2.5 jin of oilseed cake fertilizer). In addition, the supply of coal needed by cotton farmers should also be guaranteed as much as possible.

The instructions also pointed out that the pre-purchase contract should be reviewed at least once after the cotton seedlings emerge. The review of pre-purchase contracts plays a significant role in verifying cotton field area, helping cotton farmers strengthen field management, preventing pests and diseases, and improving contract procedures.

The instructions emphasized that in order to do a good job in the pre-purchase of cotton, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education among farmers regarding the state's unified cotton purchase policy and pre-purchase methods. Farmers should recognize the role of pre-purchase work in promoting increased production and completing state plans. At the same time, farmers should be educated to abide by the contract, ensuring the completion of the state's cotton production plan and pre-purchase task, and laying a good foundation for the unified purchase of cotton.

    国务院发布预购棉花工作的指示
    新华社二十二日讯　国务院在十二月二十二日发布了一九五六年预购棉花工作的指示。要求全国各产棉地区省市人民委员会在已经到来的农业合作化运动的高潮中，结合着农业合作化和农业生产的全面规划统一布置棉花预购工作。
    指示中指出：一九五五年预购棉花是根据统购任务预购棉农的全部商品棉；国家同棉农订立预购合同，不仅付给农民定金，而且优待供应一定数量的实物，棉农如果超额完成合同，其超售部分仍可得到物资供应优待。事实证明这些办法是正确的，既指导了农民按照国家计划进行生产，保证国家统购任务的完成；同时预付定金和优待供应的物资有效地解决了棉农在生产、生活上的困难，促进了农业合作化运动的发展。所以预购工作是深受农民欢迎的。另外，由于一九五五年度棉花预购工作布置较晚，也使预购工作产生了一些缺点。今年应该在工作中加以改进。
    指示中要求继续贯彻执行棉花统购政策，通过预购方法，促进棉花增产，保证国家收购任务的完成。一九五六年度生产的棉花除棉农留用棉和国家征收的赋棉以外，其余全部由国家统购，集中产棉区应该全部进行预购。
    指示中规定为了解决棉农生产上的困难，鼓励棉农按照国家计划生产和出售棉花，在订预购合同的时候付给棉农定金，同时，棉农每预售一担皮棉，在粮食、棉布统购统销的定额以外，增加供应粮食十斤，棉布十尺，并且供应五十到一百斤饼肥（化学肥料一斤折饼肥二斤半）。此外，对棉农所需要的煤炭也应该尽量保证供应。
    指示中还指出预购合同在棉苗出土后，至少要进行一次合同复查。预购合同复查对核实棉田面积，帮助棉农加强田间管理，防止病虫害和健全合同手续方面都有很大作用。
    指示中强调指出，为做好棉花预购工作必须把国家的棉花统购政策和预购办法向农民进行深入的宣传教育。使农民认识到预购工作对促进增产和完成国家计划的作用。同时应该对农民进行遵守合同的教育，保证完成国家的棉花生产计划和预购任务，为棉花统购奠定良好的基础。
