    New Record Set in Tunneling at Zhongliangshan Coalfield
    Workers opening the new adit in the southern coalfield of Zhongliangshan in Sichuan Province have set a new national record for adit tunneling with a daily progress of 9.2 meters.
    Construction of the new adit in the southern coalfield of Zhongliangshan began in September of this year. The average daily progress in September was only 3.28 meters. After mid-October, the workers improved their operating methods, changing from deep-hole operations to shallow-hole, multi-cycle operations, increasing the number of blasts per day from three to six, and ensuring that each blast completely cleared the rock, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of development. On October 27th and 28th, they successively set the highest records of 8.3 meters and 9.2 meters of daily progress (the highest national record last year was 7.95 meters). (You Kaiyuan)

    中梁山煤田出现掘进新纪录
    开拓四川省中梁山南部煤田新平洞的职工，创造了日进九点二公尺的全国平洞掘进的新纪录。
    中梁山南部煤田新平洞在今年九月开工建设。九月份平均日进尺只三点二八公尺。十月中旬以后，职工们改进了操作方法，将深眼作业的操作改为浅眼多循环作业，每天放炮次数由三次增加到六次，而且每炮都能把岩石全部炸掉，所以大大提高了开拓效率。在十月二十七、二十八两日连续创造日进八点三公尺和九点二公尺的最高纪录（去年全国最高纪录为七点九五公尺）。　　　（游开源）
