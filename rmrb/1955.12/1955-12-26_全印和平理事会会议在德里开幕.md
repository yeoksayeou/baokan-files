Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 24th. The All-India Peace Council meeting opened on the 23rd at the Constitution Club Hall in Delhi. The meeting was presided over by Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council.

Among those attending the meeting were prominent leaders and workers of the Indian peace movement such as Sundarlal, Sokhey, Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, Mulk Raj Anand, the famous writer and director Ahmed Abbas, the famous Punjab Congress leader Lala Duni Chand Ambalvi, the Indian peasant leader Indulal Yagnik, Indian Member of Parliament Renu Chakravartty, and others.

Kitchlew delivered the opening speech. He said that for every Indian, peace has become the most important thing, regardless of his political or other views. He attacked the policy of imperialist countries to establish military bases around India. He pointed out that the Manila Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact are "nothing more than a shackle to bind small Asian countries to the powerful Western imperialist countries, with the aim of dividing Asians, ruling Asians, exploiting Asians, and turning Asians into cannon fodder."

Kitchlew said amidst thunderous applause that the Geneva spirit cannot be destroyed. He called for redoubled efforts to fight against the vicious conspiracies of those who want to destroy the Bandung spirit and the Geneva spirit.

He said that this meeting will discuss various issues concerning Asia, first and foremost the issue of restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The meeting will also pay special attention to the issue of disarmament and will discuss launching the broadest movement on the issue of disarmament.

Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, Sokhey, Ahmed Abbas, Yagnik, and others also spoke at the meeting. Moro, a leader of the Australian peace movement, extended greetings to the meeting on behalf of peace-loving people in Australia.

Congratulatory messages from peace organizations of various countries, as well as from prominent peace fighters such as Pablo Neruda and Nazim Hikmet, were read out at the meeting.

The meeting began holding sessions in three committees—political, economic, and cultural—from the 24th. The plenary session will be held on December 25th.

    全印和平理事会会议在德里开幕
    新华社新德里二十四日电　全印和平理事会会议二十三日在德里宪法俱乐部大厅开幕。会议由全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁主持。
    出席会议的有印度和平运动的著名领袖和工作者森德拉尔，索克，拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人，穆尔克·拉志·阿南德，著名作家和导演艾哈迈德·阿巴斯，著名的旁遮普国大党领袖拉拉·杜尼·钱德·阿姆巴尔维，印度农民领袖印杜拉尔·雅尼克，印度国会议员雷努·查克拉瓦蒂和其他人士。
    克其鲁致开会词。他说，对于每一个印度人来说，和平已经成了最重要的一样东西，不论他的政治或其他见解如何。他抨击帝国主义国家在印度周围建立军事基地的政策。他指出，马尼拉条约组织、北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约都“不过是一种使亚洲的小国家被西方强大的帝国主义国家所束缚的枷锁，目的是想要分化亚洲人，统治亚洲人，剥削亚洲人和使亚洲人变成炮灰”。
    克其鲁在雷动的欢呼声中说，日内瓦精神是摧毁不了的。他号召加倍努力，以便同那些想摧毁万隆精神和日内瓦精神的人们的毒辣阴谋作斗争。
    他说，这次会议将讨论关于亚洲的各种问题，首先是恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位问题。会议还将特别注意裁军问题，并且将讨论就裁军问题展开最广泛的运动。
