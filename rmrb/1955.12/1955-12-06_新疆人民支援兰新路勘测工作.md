Xinjiang People Support the Surveying and Mapping Work of the Lanxin Railway

The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enthusiastically support the surveying and mapping work of the Lanxin Railway. When the Yuhai, Hahao, and Wua sections' surveying and design team moved to Hami and Urumqi, the local Party, government, and Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps provided topographical, geological, seismic, and meteorological data, and also solved the food and lodging problems for the surveying team.

The Lanxin Line, from Qiaowan west of Yumen to Yandun east of Hami, is 387 kilometers long. This area is a water-deficient zone, so finding water for locomotives and stations is an important task for the surveying team. The Hami Commissioner's Office introduced them to a Uygur farmer who had driven camels between Dunhuang and Hami fifteen years ago and was very familiar with the area. He led the water supply team to find water everywhere and discovered several water sources. The route selection work for the Hahao section was carried out in two lines, north and south. The southern line goes from Hami through the Turpan Basin, passes Dabancheng, and reaches Urumqi. The northern line goes from Hami through Qijiaojing, passes Qitai, and reaches Urumqi. Whether it is the southern line or the northern line, it is necessary to cross the Tianshan Mountains. Where the railway crosses the Tianshan Mountains is a key issue to be resolved in route selection. The head of the Mulei Kazakh Autonomous County is familiar with the terrain on the northern and southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains. He provided the surveying team members with a lot of information and introduced Kazakh herders who often traveled in this area to lead the surveying team members. The team members who surveyed the line from Urumqi to Alashankou on the Sino-Soviet border were warmly welcomed and treated by the farms and Mongolian and Kazakh herders along the way when passing through the Junggar Basin.

    新疆人民支援兰新路勘测工作
    新疆各族人民热情地支援兰新铁路的勘测工作。玉哈、哈乌和乌阿段勘测设计总队搬到哈密和乌鲁木齐，当地的党、政府和新疆军区生产建设部队提供了地形、地质、地震、气象等项资料，并且给勘测队人员解决了食宿问题。
    兰新线从玉门以西的桥湾到哈密以东的烟墩，全长三百八十七公里，这一带是缺水区，因此，寻找机车和车站的用水，是勘测队的重要任务。哈密专署给他们介绍了一个维族农民，这个农民在十五年前，曾赶过骆驼，来往敦煌和哈密，对这一带非常熟悉。他领着给水队的人四处找水，发现了几处水源。哈乌段的选线工作，分南北两路进行。南线由哈密经吐鲁番盆地，过达坂城到乌鲁木齐，北线由哈密经七角井，过奇台到乌鲁木齐，不论南线或北线，都要翻越天山。铁路在什么地方越过天山，是选线中要解决的关键问题。木垒哈萨克族自治县县长熟悉这一段天山南北麓的地形，他向勘测队员提供了许多情况，并且介绍经常来往这一带的哈萨克牧民给勘测队队员带路。踏勘乌鲁木齐到中苏国境线上阿拉山口的队员，经过准噶尔盆地时，受到沿途各农场和蒙族、哈萨克族牧民的热烈欢迎和款待。
