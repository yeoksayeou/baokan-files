    Soviet Leaders in India
    Soviet reporters Zhukov, Olestov, Skalkin
    Editor's Note: During the visit of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to India, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" continuously published dispatches from its special correspondents, Zhukov, Olestov, and Skalkin. We are now excerpting and publishing a portion of these dispatches. The general title is added by this newspaper, and the subheadings are the original titles. The date after each dispatch is the date it was published in "Pravda."

    "Indians and Russians are brothers!"
    "Hindi-Rusi bhai bhai!"
    "Indians and Russians are brothers!"

    Today, this sentence is being spread very warmly in Delhi. Students are chanting this sentence in rhythm. Young men and women wearing bright Indian costumes are loudly and neatly repeating this sentence. This sentence is also written in gold on the red banners hanging over the city streets.

    To welcome the Soviet guests, the city and suburban villages prepared all night. All the new archways were erected, flags and laurel wreaths were hung, stages were built for amateur orchestras to perform, and the facades of the houses were decorated with bright, colorful silks.

    On the roads leading to the capital, there were endless lines of farmers' carts decorated with Indian and Soviet flags. The most beautiful flowers were sent from Kashmir and Mysore, and these flowers were woven into huge garlands to be placed on the distinguished guests according to ancient Indian custom. Countless rose petals were piled up in the rose gardens, in order to scatter the petals on the guests when they entered the capital.

    The roads leading to the airport were extremely congested. No matter how enthusiastic the traffic controllers were (several thousand volunteers helped them), they could not get all the cars, carts, and camel, horse, and elephant riders through. We saw an elephant with several people holding large red flags on its back. On the elephant's clothing, the word "Swagatam," meaning "welcome," was written in Hindi in a dazzling manner.

    Not only were the roads from the airport to the city crowded with people, but the streets and squares through which the guests had to pass were also crowded. Among the welcoming crowds were 20,000 farmers from the suburbs and 200,000 workers from various enterprises in Delhi.

    The "Hindustan Times" wrote: "The day the Soviet leaders arrived in our capital has become a national holiday."

    The roar of engines was heard in the sky above the airport, and a twin-engine Soviet plane landed, escorted by four Indian jet fighters on each side.

    Over a distance of twenty kilometers, hundreds of thousands of people welcoming the distinguished guests looked like many dense walls.

    In Delhi's central square, the welcome was particularly moving and magnificent. Here, the residents had covered the entire road with a carpet of flowers, and every certain distance on the road had the word "Welcome!" spelled out with red carnations. The car moved slowly along this brightly colored carpet.
                            (November 19)

    In the Region of Five Rivers

    The government car for the Soviet guests began its journey across the country, driving north all night. At dawn, a beautiful landscape appeared outside the car window.

    This is Punjab, which in Russian means "the region of five rivers." Its most fertile land is irrigated by the waters of five rivers originating in the Himalayas—the Beas River, the Sutlej River, the Ravi River, the Chenab River, and the Jhelum River. The colonizers cruelly divided Punjab: its western part was assigned to the territory of Pakistan, while the eastern part was assigned to India.

    Agriculture began in these areas many centuries ago, and Punjab has always been India's granary. The wheat and cotton of the Five Rivers Basin play a huge role in the country's food and raw material balance.

    The guests got into the car and, accompanied by the governor and the leaders of the construction project, drove to a major construction project—the huge Bhakra Dam. Two hydroelectric power stations with ten hydraulic turbines each will be built here, each turbine with a generating capacity of 90,000 kilowatts.

    The guests were led to a tunnel, through which water will flow to the hydroelectric station's turbines. Khrushchev was very interested in the details of digging and repairing the tunnel. When Indian experts praised his profound technical knowledge in this regard, Khrushchev smiled and said, "I like huge construction projects. As for digging, I myself worked in a mine when I was young, so I am familiar with the mining industry."

    People asked Bulganin to talk about his impressions of the construction project. He happily replied:

    "Very good. The fact that people work with great enthusiasm as if it were for themselves has left the deepest impression on me. This reminds me of the situation during our first five-year plan, when we built our first powerful hydroelectric power stations."

    When Khrushchev talked with the leaders of the construction project, he emphasized the great significance of mastering advanced technical experience. "You should study, this is the main thing when you start such a huge undertaking," he said. "Sometimes it is even unpleasant to appear in the role of a student, but what can you do? You should be a student. And after you have learned, you will help others to learn. We did the same. As our proverb says: 'The devil is not as scary as people paint him.' There is also a proverb 'The pot was not fired by God.' All of this is done by people. You will not only learn to build such power stations, but also to build even more powerful power stations."
                          (November 23)

    The Conquered Jungle

    Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin, together with the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Sampurnanand, set off for the largest Tarai State Experimental Farm.

    When the Soviet guests walked to the farm's new standard small houses, an elderly man with a very tall figure and a thick black beard came out to greet them. This is the farm director, Sande Hong.

    The guests began to visit the poultry farm. Farm workers in blue shirts and camouflage shorts enthusiastically welcomed the guests along the way.

    "It's a very good farm," Khrushchev said approvingly.

    Bulganin picked up a chick and looked at it. American and British photographers, who had been following the Moscow guests all day, hurriedly captured this shot.

    Comrade Khrushchev smiled and said to them:

    "But remember, just don't add the explanation that the Bolsheviks are going to strangle Indian chicks."

    When this sentence was translated, everyone burst into laughter, because this sentence hit the nail on the head. In these days, many American and British newspapers were talking nonsense, and they were trying their best to make Indians believe that the visit of the Moscow guests harbored some kind of "danger" for them.

    Khrushchev and Bulganin continued to visit the farm.

    Of course, one must not avoid the fact that the vast majority of Indian farmers, even those living near Tarai, only have very small plots of land, and therefore cannot utilize the experience of similar large farms. Landless farmers and hired laborers cannot dream of tractors and combine harvesters. Therefore, what Indian farmers are primarily interested in is land reform that can help farmers get rid of the enslavement of landlords and usurers.

    Nevertheless, it can still be boldly said that even in this situation, the activities of the Tarai state farm are clearly serving the interests of developing the Indian economy. Both Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin spoke highly of the significance of the work being carried out by the farm staff in their conversations with the farm staff.
                          (November 24)

    Soviet Guests in Bombay

    Khrushchev and Bulganin visited a textile factory belonging to the "Tata" Concern. Tata is the name of a big capitalist in India. He established his first textile factory in 1887. Now, Tata's descendants not only own textile factories, but also many other enterprises.

    During the visit to the production process, Bulganin and Khrushchev pointed out the high skills of the Indian weavers. Bulganin asked where the dyes came from. The factory director explained that they came from the United States, Britain, and Sweden, and also used a small amount of Indian dyes.

    After visiting the textile factory, the guests visited the state-run dairy farm.

    The guests were led to a beautiful pavilion on a high mountain, and tall palm trees grew on the hillside. Kulej, the commissioner of the Bombay Municipal Government's Dairy Industry, talked about how the idea of establishing this dairy farm came about and how it was realized. He said:

    "It is not yet known to everyone that one-third of the world's cattle are in India. This is a very large number. But the bad thing is that the milk production of our dairy cows is generally very low."

    Khrushchev and Bulganin listened with great interest to the director's explanation and asked him a lot of questions. In particular, Khrushchev asked the director in detail how much Paraguay grass was harvested, how livestock feeding was arranged, how many times dairy cows were milked, and how much milk could be milked. It was learned that the average annual milk yield was about 2,000 kilograms, the fat content of Indian buffalo milk was 7.5 percent, and the fat content of general cow's milk was 5 percent.

    "The fat content is very good," Khrushchev said, "higher than many of our dairy farms. But your milk yield is not high. In the best farms operated by our country—we call them state farms—the average milk yield is 5,000 to 6,000 liters a year."

    "But how many years have you been breeding highly productive breeds?" the director said.

    "To some extent, you are right," Khrushchev said. "Breeding work has its importance. But in our opinion, the main thing is still the feeding of livestock. We believe that one-third of the milk yield depends on breeding, and two-thirds depends on feeding."

    The director agreed with this statement, but he also pointed out that India's establishment of its own dairy industry was actually only five or six years ago, that is, after it gained independence.

    "Please forgive me, I don't agree with this point," Khrushchev said with a smile, "Our people learned animal breeding from you. Your culture is much older than ours."

    "But in the era of British rule, everything was wiped out," Bombay State Chief Minister Desai joined the conversation. "In these two hundred years, we have almost become barbarians..."

    "Come to our country," Khrushchev said to the director, "we will introduce you to our best farms, tell you our experience, and help you."

    The director warmly thanked the invitation and invited the guests to start visiting the livestock farm.
                          (November 25)

    A Festival of Indo-Soviet Friendship

    Today, from the morning onwards, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited the Badgaon Agricultural Experimental Station and the Central Hydrodynamic Experimental Station near Pune.

    The following situation attracted the attention of the guests: a bull clumsily stepped on the mature rice bundles scattered on the threshing floor. This is how grain has been threshed here since ancient times. "We are familiar with this," Khrushchev said: "In the past, in Ukraine, this method was used to thresh grain—cattle dragged toothed rollers over the bundles of grain." Next to it, a farmer was winnowing the fallen grains of rice, slowly pouring them out of the winnowing fan. "We are also familiar with this," Khrushchev said: "In our old rural areas, we used shovels to winnow grain, just like this." He then told his interlocutor how this was done. "And now we have used machines to replace manual labor," he concluded.

    The guests visited the experimental plots for planting rice. One of the plots was being cultivated—a staff member was driving two Indian buffaloes with long horns painted red. In another plot, some female staff members were planting green rice seedlings. In the third plot, a staff member was cutting the mature rice with a sickle. Khrushchev smiled and said to him:

    "Hey, let's try it and see if I can compete with you." So he walked from the high ridge to the field, picked up the sickle and began to cut the rice with confident, rapid movements.

    This direct act of cutting rice gave a great impression to everyone present, and the farmers from the neighboring villages gathered on the other side of the field burst into applause.
                          (November 26)

    Invincible Strength

    Today, Khrushchev and Bulganin arrived in Calcutta after a long flight over East India.

    Approximately three million people gathered on the streets of Calcutta to welcome the Soviet guests. On both sides of the fifteen-kilometer road from Dum Dum Airport to the Governor's residence, there were huge crowds of people. Before long, the two streams of people merged into one, and the car had to move forward step by step.

    Tens of millions of hands stretched out from all directions to the open-top car in which Khrushchev and Bulganin were sitting. Applause and cheers rang out everywhere, and children released pigeons and colorful balloons into the sky. Flowers fell like rain all over the car. All the balconies and roofs of the five- and six-story buildings were crowded with people. From there, cries were heard: "Indians and Russians are brothers!", "Peace and Friendship!", "Long live Bulganin and Khrushchev!".

    Bengali reporters said that Calcutta had never seen such a warm and grand welcoming procession in its history.

    The whole city was decorated with lights and colors like a festival. Today and tomorrow, all enterprises and institutions are closed: due to the arrival of the Soviet guests, the local authorities announced a holiday.
                            (November 30)

    An Unforgettable Day in Calcutta

    ...This morning, representatives of the Indian authorities humorously said that due to the arrival of distinguished guests in Calcutta, the city's residents are increasing minute by minute. According to statistics, about 500 people come to the city every minute from all over Bengal—by train, by boat, by car, by farmer's cart, and even on foot. They are all filled with one wish—to see Khrushchev and Bulganin, to hear their speeches, and to express their enthusiasm to them.

    Calcutta, one of India's largest cities, is the administrative and cultural center of West Bengal. It has the country's largest port, through which more than nine million tons of cargo are transported annually, accounting for half of the total throughput of Indian ports.

    Early in the morning, N.S. Khrushchev and N.A. Bulganin went to the port, where a snow-white ship, the "Hooghly," was waiting for them.

    On both banks of the Hooghly River, docks for ocean-going vessels stretched out. Today, the docks were crowded with huge crowds of people. Bulganin and Khrushchev greeted the people of Calcutta from the captain's bridge. People responded with stormy cheers. The ship weighed anchor and sailed downstream. On the left and on the right, you could see the factory buildings and chimneys of many factories in industrial Calcutta. Workers crowded on the river bank constantly applauded and shouted welcoming slogans.

    The "Hooghly" docked, and the guests got into the car and went to the nearby area that produces jute and textiles. The streets were as crowded as yesterday. The sounds of warm welcomes were constantly heard. The car turned into the courtyard of a jute factory. Unlike other enterprises, this factory was working today, wanting to let the guests see the manufacture and production of jute products.

    As soon as the guests walked into the workshop, everything changed in an instant; the workers left their machines and ran to welcome the guests. Flower garlands and bouquets woven with fresh flowers immediately appeared from nowhere, and the workers presented them to Bulganin and Khrushchev. The administrative representatives of the factory presented gifts to the guests on behalf of the workers and staff—small silver tents, which were accurate replicas of the factory's products.

    The sound of cheers drowned out the sound of the machines that had not yet been turned off. Many workers tried their best to get close to the Soviet leaders in order to linger with them a little longer and shake hands with them. N.S. Khrushchev and N.A. Bulganin cordially greeted the workers with their palms placed in front of their chests in the traditional Indian "Namaste" gesture. This caused new stormy applause. The news that the guests from Moscow had come to the factory spread throughout the area with lightning speed, and on the way back, the car could only pass through the unimaginably increasing crowd with great difficulty.

专栏：

    苏联领袖在印度
    苏联  茹科夫、奥列斯托夫、斯卡尔金
    编者按：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫访问印度期间，苏联“真理报”连续发表了该报特派记者茹科夫、奥列斯托夫和斯卡尔金的通讯。现在我们把这些通讯的一部分摘译出来发表。总标题是本报所加，插题是原文的题目。每节通讯后面的日期是在“真理报”上发表的日期。“印度人和俄国人是兄弟！”
    “印地—露西巴伊巴伊！”
    “印度人和俄国人是兄弟！”
    今天在德里十分亲切地传扬着这句话。学生们有节拍地齐声喊着这句话。穿着鲜艳的印度服装的青年男女大声地整齐地重复着这句话。悬挂在城市大街上空的红色横幅上，也用金字写着这句话。
    为了欢迎苏联客人，城市和郊区的乡村准备了一整夜。搭起了所有新的牌楼，挂起了旗帜和用月桂树枝编的花环，建起了供业余管弦乐队演奏用的台子，房屋的正面也用鲜艳的五颜六色的绸布装饰起来了。
    在通向首都的大路上，绵延着用印度和苏联国旗装饰起来的望不到头的农民的大车行列。从克什米尔和卖索尔山区送来了最美丽的花朵，用这些花朵编了一些巨大的花环，以便按照印度古老的习惯给贵宾们戴上。玫瑰花坛里堆积着无数的玫瑰花瓣，为的是当客人们进入首都的时候把花瓣撒在他们身上。
    在通向机场的公路上，一直拥挤得水泄不通。不管指挥交通的人（有几千志愿者帮助他们）怎样热心，他们也无法使所有的汽车、大车和骑骆驼、马以及大象的人流通过。我们看到了一只象，在它的脊背上坐着几个拿着大幅红旗的人。在象衣上面鲜艳夺目地用印地文写着“斯瓦加塔姆”，就是“欢迎”的意思。
    不仅从机场通向城市的公路上挤满了人群，在客人们必须经过的大街和广场上也挤满了人。在欢迎的人群中有两万名近郊的农民，二十万名德里市各企业的工人。
    “印度斯坦时报”写道：“苏联领袖到达我们首都的日子变成了民族的节日。”
    在机场上空听见了马达的隆隆声，一架双引擎的苏联飞机在左右两面各有四架印度喷气式战斗机的护航下降落了。
    在足足二十公里长的距离中间，几十万欢迎贵宾的人们好像许多道密密的墙垣。
    在德里中央广场上，人们的欢迎特别动人和华丽。在这里，居民把整条马路都用鲜花的地毯铺上了，在马路上每隔一定的距离就有用红色石竹花铺成了的“欢迎！”字样。汽车沿着这条鲜艳的地毯缓慢地前进。
                            （十一月十九日）
    在五条河流的地区
    供苏联客人乘坐的政府专车，开始了它在国内的旅行，整夜地向北方行驶。当黎明的时候，在车窗外面现出了美丽的风景。
    这是旁遮普，俄文的意思是“五河之区”。它的最肥沃的土地用发源于喜马拉雅山的五条河流——比阿斯河、苏特里杰河、拉维河、奇那勃河和杰拉姆河——的河水灌溉着。殖民者残忍地分割了旁遮普：它的西部划归巴基斯坦的版图，而东部则划归印度。
    在许多世纪以前，在这些地区就开始了农业，旁遮普向来是印度的谷仓。五河流域的小麦和棉花在国家的粮食和原料平衡中起着巨大的作用。
    客人们坐上汽车，由省长和建筑工程领导人员陪同驶向一个主要的建筑工程——巨大的巴克拉水闸。这里将建成两座有十部水力涡轮机的水力发电站，每部涡轮机有九万瓩的发电能力。
    客人们被引到一条隧道来，水将沿着这条隧道流向水电站的涡轮机。赫鲁晓夫对于挖掘和修整隧道的细节很感兴趣。当印度专家们称赞他在这方面的高深的技术知识的时候，赫鲁晓夫微笑着说：“我喜欢巨大的建筑工程。至于说到挖掘，我自己在年青的时候曾在矿井中工作过，因此，采矿业我是熟悉的。”
    人们请布尔加宁谈一谈他对于建筑工程的印象。他乐意地回答说：
    “很好。人们像为自己那样以极大的热情而工作的事实留给了我最深的印象。这使我想起了我们第一个五年计划的情况，当时我们建立了自己第一批强大的水力发电站。”
    赫鲁晓夫同建筑工程领导人员谈话时，强调指出掌握先进技术经验的巨大意义。“应该学习，当你们开始这样巨大的事业的时候，这是主要的。”他说：“有时候以学生的角色出现甚至是不愉快的，然而，有什么办法呢？应该当学生。而在学成以后自己将帮助别人学习。我们也是这样做了的。像我们的谚语所说的：‘鬼并不像人们画的那样可怕。’还有一句谚语‘罐子不是上帝烧的。’这一切都是人做的。你们不仅学会建设这样的发电站，而且要学会建设更强大的发电站。”
                          （十一月二十三日）
    被征服了的丛林
    赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志和北方省首席部长萨姆普尔纳南德一起向最大的特拉伊国营实验农场出发。
    当苏联的客人们走到了农场的新的标准小房子的时候，出来迎接他们的是一个身材非常高大的、有着浓密黑胡子的上了年纪的人。这就是农场场长山德洪。
    客人们开始参观养禽场。穿蓝色衬衣和保护色的短裤的农场工人在沿路热烈地欢迎客人。
      “是一个很好的农场，”赫鲁晓夫赞许地说。
    布尔加宁拿起一只小鸡看了看。终日跟随着莫斯科的客人们的美国和英国的摄影记者急忙地摄取这个镜头。
    赫鲁晓夫同志微笑地向他们说：
    “可要记住，只是不要加上布尔什维克要扼死印度小鸡的说明啊。”
    当这句话翻译出来的时候，大家全都哈哈大笑起来，因为这句话正打中了要害。在这些天里，许多美国和英国的报纸在胡说八道，它们在千方百计地使印度人相信，好像是莫斯科的客人的访问对于他们孕育着某种“危险”。
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁继续参观农场。
    自然，绝不能回避这个事实：绝大多数的印度农民，甚至住在特拉伊附近的农民都只有极小片的土地，因而还不能利用类似大农场的经验。无地的农民和雇农是不能幻想拖拉机和联合收割机的。因此，首先使印度农民感到兴趣的是那能帮助农民摆脱地主和高利贷奴役的土地改革。
    尽管如此，仍可以大胆地说，甚至在这种情况下特拉伊的国营农场的活动显然仍是在为发展印度经济的利益服务。赫鲁晓夫同志或布尔加宁同志在同农场工作人员的谈话中，都对农场工作人员所进行的那种工作的意义估价很高。
                          （十一月二十四日）
    苏联客人在孟买
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁参观了一个属于“塔塔”康采恩的纺织工厂。塔塔是印度一个大资本家的名字。他在一八八七年就建立了自己第一个纺织工厂。现在，塔塔的后代不仅拥有纺织工厂，还拥有许多其他企业。
    在参观生产的时候，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫指出了印度织工的高度技巧。布尔加宁询问，颜料是从哪里来的。厂长解释说，是从美国、英国、瑞典来的，也用一小部分印度颜料。
    参观过纺织工厂以后，客人们访问了国营牛奶场。
    客人们被引到一个高山上的美丽的凉亭里，山坡上长着高高的棕榈树。孟买市政府牛奶业管理专员库罗吉谈到建立这个牛奶场的念头是怎样产生和怎样实现的。他说：
    “世界上三分之一的牛是在印度，这还不是人人都知道的事。这是一个很大的数字。但糟糕的是，我们的乳牛的产奶量一般都非常低。”
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁怀着浓厚的兴趣听了场长的说明，并向他提出大量问题。特别是赫鲁晓夫曾详细问场长，巴拉圭草的收割量如何，怎样安排牲畜饲养，对乳牛的挤奶次数是多少，以及能挤多少奶。结果知道，一年的平均挤奶量约近两千公斤，印度水牛的奶的含脂量是百分之七点五，一般乳牛的奶的含脂量是百分之五。
    “含脂量很好，”赫鲁晓夫说，“比我们许多牛奶场高。但是你们的挤奶量并不大。在我国国家经营的最好的农场——我们称为国营农场——里，平均挤奶量一年是五千到六千公升。”
    “可是你们培养有高度产品量的畜种已有多少年了啊？”场长说。
    “从某种程度来说，您是对的。”赫鲁晓夫说，“育种工作有它的重要意义。但是在我们看来，主要的还在于对牲畜的饲养。我们认为，三分之一的挤奶量是靠育种，三分之二靠饲养。”
    场长同意了这种说法，但是他也指出，印度建立自己的牛奶业实际上仅是在五、六年以前，即在它获得独立以后。
    “请你原谅，我不同意这点，”赫鲁晓夫笑着说，“我国人民繁殖牲畜是向你们学习的。你们的文化远比我们古老。”
    “但是在英国统治的年代，一切都化为乌有了。”孟买省首席部长德赛加入了谈话。“在这二百年中我们几乎变成了野蛮人……。”
    “到我们国家来吧，”赫鲁晓夫对场长说，“我们将介绍你们看我们最好的农场，把我们的经验告诉你们，帮助你们。”
    场长热烈地感谢这个邀请，并请客人们开始参观养畜场。
                          （十一月二十五日）
    印苏友好的节日
    今天从早晨起，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问了巴德加昂农业实验站和浦那附近的中央水力动力实验站。
    下面这个情况引起了客人们的注意：一头公牛在散布在打谷场上的成熟的稻束上拙笨地踩来踩去。这里自古以来就是这样打谷的。“我们是熟悉这个的。”赫鲁晓夫说：“从前的时候在乌克兰就是用这种方法打谷——牛拖着带棱齿的磙子在禾束上辗。”旁边有一个农民在簸打落的稻粒，慢慢地把它们从簸箕里倒出来。“我们也熟悉这个。”赫鲁晓夫说：“在我们旧日的农村里用铲子扬谷粒，就像这样。”他于是告诉他的谈话对方，这是怎样来进行的。“而现在我们已经用机器来代替手的劳动了。”他结束说。
    客人们参观栽种水稻的实验地段。其中的一个地段正在进行耕作——一个工作人员驾驭着两头有着涂红了的长角的印度水牛。另一个地段，一些女工作人员在插绿色的稻秧。第三个地段一个工作人员用镰刀割成熟的稻子。赫鲁晓夫微笑着向他说：
  “喂，让我们试一试，看看我同你是不是对手。”于是他从高的田埂走到田间，拿起镰刀开始用有把握的、迅速的动作割稻子。
    这种直接割稻的动作给所有在场者以巨大的印象，而聚集在田地的另一面的邻近村庄的农民们，暴风雨般地鼓起掌来。
                          （十一月二十六日）
    不可战胜的力量
    今天，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁经过了在东印度上空的长时间飞行，来到了加尔各答。
    大约有三百万人聚集在加尔各答的街道上欢迎苏联客人。在从都木——都木机场到省长官邸的十五公里长的道路两旁，人山人海。不一会，这两股人流合而为一，汽车不得不一步一步往前移动。
    千万只手从四面八方伸向赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁所坐的敞篷汽车。到处响起了掌声和欢呼声，孩子们把鸽子和五彩汽球放到天空中。花像雨点一般地落满了汽车。在五、六层大楼所有的阳台和屋顶上都挤满了人。从那里发出了呼声：“印度人和俄国人是兄弟！”，“和平和友谊！”，“布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫万岁！”。
    孟加拉的记者们说，加尔各答有史以来不曾有过这样热烈的、盛大的欢迎行列。
    全市像过节一样悬灯结彩。今天和明天，所有的企业和机关都休息：由于苏联客人的光临，地方当局宣布放假。
                            （十一月三十日）
    加尔各答的难忘的一天
    ……今天早晨，印度当局的代表们幽默地说，由于贵宾光临加尔各答，城市的居民每分钟每分钟地在增加着。据统计，每分钟从孟加拉各地——坐火车、搭轮船、乘汽车、坐农民的大车以至步行——来到城里的约有五百人。他们全都是满怀着一个愿望——看到赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁，听到他们的讲话，并且向他们表示自己的热情。
    印度的一个最大的城市加尔各答是西孟加拉省的行政和文化中心。这里有国内最大的港口，经过这个港口每年运输九百万吨以上的货物，达印度港口全部吞吐量的一半。
    一清早，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和尼·亚·布尔加宁到港口去，一艘雪白的“霍格里号”船在港口等候他们。
    在霍格里河的两岸伸展着为海洋轮船用的码头。今天码头上拥满了巨大的人群。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫从船长桥楼上向加尔各答人致意。人们报以暴风雨般的欢呼。船起了锚，顺流向下行驶。在左边和在右边可以看到工业的加尔各答许多工厂的厂房和烟囱。拥到河岸上的工人不断地鼓掌和高呼欢迎的口号。
    “霍格里号”靠岸了，客人们坐上汽车到附近的生产黄麻和纺织品的地区去。街道上和昨天一样挤满了人。不断地响着热烈欢迎的声音。汽车转弯驶进一个黄麻工厂的院子里。这个工厂和其他企业不同的是今天在工作，想让客人们看一看黄麻制品的制造和生产。
    客人们刚刚走进车间，顷刻间一切都变了；工人们离开自己的机床，跑来欢迎客人。不知从什么地方立即出现了用鲜花编的花环和花束，工人们把它们赠送给布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。工厂的行政代表代表工人和职员向客人们奉献礼物——银制的小帐篷，这是这个工厂产品的精确的仿制品。
    欢呼的声音压过了还没有关住的机器的声音。许多工人竭力挤近苏联的领导人，以便同他们更多盘桓一些时候，同他们握一握手。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和尼·亚·布尔加宁按印度传统的“合掌”姿势把手掌放在胸前亲切地向工人们致意。这引起新的暴风雨般的掌声。关于莫斯科的客人来到工厂的消息，以一种闪电般的速度在全区传布开来，而在回头的路上，汽车只能极其困难地穿过难以想像地不断增加的人群。
