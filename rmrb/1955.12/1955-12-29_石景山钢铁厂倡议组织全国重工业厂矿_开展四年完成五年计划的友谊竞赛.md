The meeting proposed a guarantee to complete the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and adopted a proposal to the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the All-China Federation of Heavy Industry Trade Unions to organize a friendship competition among national heavy industry plants and mines of the same type.

The proposal stated: Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the pace of socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce in our country has greatly accelerated. All employees of our factory are encouraged by this new situation and believe that accelerating socialist industrialization, especially giving play to the basic role of heavy industry enterprises, has become an urgent task. After enthusiastic discussions, the employees of our factory believe that the working class nationwide should, with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in building socialism, launch friendship competitions among the same types of work with a fighting attitude, so as to encourage each other, help each other, and improve together, to ensure that the Five-Year Plan is completed in four years. Therefore, we propose that heavy industry plants and mines nationwide be organized to carry out a friendship competition to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. The proposal also put forward their eight competition guarantee conditions, including guaranteeing to reach the total value of production target of 1957 in 1956, guaranteeing that the output of major products in 1956 will reach or exceed the target of 1957, and guaranteeing that the quality indicators of major products in 1956 will meet the requirements of 1957, etc.

    据新华社二十八日讯　石景山钢铁厂二十七日举行了职工代表会议。会上提出保证，提前一年完成第一个五年计划，并且通过了建议重工业部、中国重工业工会全国委员会组织全国重工业厂矿开展同工种友谊竞赛的倡议书。
    倡议书中说：在党中央和毛主席英明的领导下，我国对农业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的速度，已经大大加快。我厂全体职工为这个新的形势所鼓舞，认为加速社会主义工业化，特别是发挥重工业企业的基础作用，已经成为一个迫切的任务。我厂职工经过热烈的讨论，认为全国工人阶级都应该以主人翁的态度，发挥建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，以战斗姿态展开同工种友谊竞赛，以便互相鼓励，互相帮助，共同提高，以保证五年计划四年完成。因此，我们建议：把全国重工业厂矿组织起来，开展五年计划四年完成的友谊竞赛。倡议书中还提出了他们的八项竞赛保证条件，有保证在一九五六年达到一九五七年的生产总值指标，保证主要产品产量一九五六年达到或者超过一九五七年的指标，保证在一九五六年主要产品质量指标达到一九五七年的要求等。
