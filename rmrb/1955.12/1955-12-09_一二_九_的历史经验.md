    The historical experience of the "December 9th" Movement
    Yao Yilin

    "Integrating intellectual youth with workers and peasants" and "going to the countryside" were slogans put forward by the "December 9th" Movement. This was an important instruction given by the Chinese Communist Party to intellectual youth at that time.

    At the beginning of the "December 9th" Movement, the young students of Beiping, filled with enthusiasm, petitioned the Kuomintang reactionary government, demanding an end to the civil war and united resistance against Japan. However, this petition movement was subjected to the reactionary government's brutal suppression. The reactionary government's armed massacre further aroused the righteous indignation of the vast number of young students. Many young students who had not participated in the struggle during the "December 9th" petition joined the struggle against Japanese aggression and against the Kuomintang reactionary government, pushing the movement forward and leading to the "December 16th" demonstration, which was larger in scale than the "December 9th" petition. This demonstration was no longer, and could not be, a "peaceful" petition. From the beginning, it was characterized by direct conflict with the Kuomintang reactionary government's army and police, and many people shed blood in the struggle. The problem facing the young students of Beiping at that time was: in the face of such cruel suppression by the Kuomintang reactionary government, how could the students' movement for resisting Japanese aggression and saving the country be further advanced? Obviously, it was no longer possible to hold larger demonstrations. If they were forced to be held, they would only be met with greater suppression and massacres.

    At this time, the Chinese Communist Party instructed the students of Beiping in this way: relying solely on the student movement in Beiping alone is not enough. It is necessary to send representatives extensively to contact various parts of the country and to launch a widespread movement for resisting Japanese aggression and saving the nation throughout the country. Relying solely on the patriotic struggle of the student masses is not enough. It is necessary to further call on intellectual youth to integrate with workers and peasants, to go to factories and the countryside to spread the seeds of revolution, and at the same time, to educate and temper the intellectual youth themselves in the struggle of integrating with workers and peasants. Under the correct guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, the students of Beiping carried out these two tasks, thus promoting the more extensive development of the movement for resisting Japanese aggression and saving the nation throughout the country, and organizing and training an advanced force of intellectual youth—the National Liberation Vanguard of China—during the southward propaganda campaign. The rural propaganda movement of students in Peiping and Tianjin in January 1936 was the beginning of the integration of intellectual youth with workers and peasants in the era of the "December 9th" Movement. This integration was further developed and consolidated later in the forms of workers' night schools, peasants' night schools, rural elementary schools, and home visits, until after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the broad masses of intellectual youth participated in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines under the call of the Party, and achieved greater and more advanced development.

    The integration of intellectual youth with workers and peasants is a fundamental tempering and education for the intellectual youth themselves. In the era of the "December 9th" Movement and in the twenty years that followed, countless intellectual youth received this education under the leadership of the Party, tempered and transformed themselves, and became vanguard fighters in the ranks of the proletariat. Because the vast majority of these intellectual youth came from the families of exploiters or small property owners, their advantage was that many of them had feelings of dissatisfaction with the old society, felt that there was no way out for the future of the country and their own future, and held enthusiasm and hope for the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. Precisely because of this, many revolutionary intellectual youths were willing to dedicate themselves to the revolutionary struggle, accept the leadership of the working class, and improve and transform themselves in the struggle. But on the other hand, intellectual youth themselves also have many shortcomings. Their ideology is often severely eroded by the ideology of the exploiting classes. Their knowledge is often just a little something learned from books, lacking practical knowledge from real life. They often have arrogant and complacent feelings of self-importance and extraordinary ambitions, and many unrealistic fantasies, which seriously hinder their own learning and progress. Only in the struggle of integrating with workers and peasants, sincerely accepting the leadership of the working class, putting down their airs, humbly and earnestly learning from the workers and peasants, and constantly being vigilant and overcoming their own shortcomings and errors in ideology and methodology, is it possible to keep their revolutionary thinking evergreen, to prevent themselves from falling behind, and to gradually develop themselves into skilled revolutionaries. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The final distinction between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing to and do integrate with the workers and peasants." This great instruction should always be the motto of all revolutionaries who come from intellectuals.

    The era we are in now is fundamentally different from the era of the "December 9th" Movement. In the twenty years since the "December 9th" Movement, China's national and democratic revolution has been victorious, the People's Republic of China has been established, and China has entered a new revolutionary era—the era of socialist revolution. This revolution is more profound and greater than the previous democratic revolution. Through the country's socialist industrialization construction and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, we will victoriously build a great socialist country in the near future.

    Under the education and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party, the vast number of intellectual youths in New China have greatly improved their political consciousness compared with the intellectual youths in the era of the "December 9th" Movement. They enthusiastically support the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, support the socialist revolution, and are willing to fight for the complete victory of the socialist cause. However, there are also some intellectual youths who, influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes, look down on the workers and peasants, are unwilling to integrate with the workers and peasants, and are unwilling to serve the workers and peasants.

    Therefore, on this 20th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement, to once again put forward the slogan of "Integrating intellectual youth with workers and peasants" that was already put forward in the era of the "December 9th" Movement, still has practical significance for the current intellectual youth. This slogan will inspire all intellectual youth in New China to bravely advance on the correct path that the intellectual youth of the "December 9th" era have already traveled under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party—the path of integrating with workers and peasants—in the socialist cause.

    “一二·九”的历史经验
    姚依林
    “知识青年和工农相结合”，“到农村去”，是“一二·九”运动提出来的口号。这是当时中国共产党给予知识青年的重要的指示。
    在“一二·九”运动刚开始的时候，北平的青年学生抱着满腔的热忱，向国民党反动政府请愿，要求停止内战，一致抗日，但是这个请愿运动遭受了反动政府残酷的镇压。反动政府的武装屠杀，进一步激起了广大青年学生的义愤，许多在“一二·九”请愿中没有参加斗争的青年学生卷入了抗日和反对国民党反动政府的斗争，把运动向前推进了一步，爆发了比“一二·九”请愿规模更大的“一二·一六”示威游行。这次示威游行已经不是，也不可能再是“和平的”请愿了，它一开始就带着同国民党反动政府的军队和警察直接冲突的性质，许多人在斗争中流了血。当时摆在北平青年学生面前的问题是：在国民党反动政府这样残酷的镇压面前，如何把学生的抗日救国运动向前推进一步呢？显然地，已经不可能举行规模更大的示威游行了，如果要勉强举行的话，只会遭到更大的镇压和屠杀。
    这时，中国共产党这样地指示了北平学生：只靠北平一地的学生运动是不行的，必须广泛地派出代表到全国各地去进行联系，在全国各地掀起广泛的抗日救亡运动；只靠学生群众的爱国斗争是不行的，必须进一步号召知识青年和工农相结合，到工厂中、农村中去散播革命的种子，同时在和工农相结合的斗争中，教育和锻炼知识青年自己。在中国共产党的正确指示下，北平学生执行了这两项任务，因而促进了抗日救亡运动在全国范围内更广泛的开展，并在南下宣传中组织了和锻炼了知识青年的先进队伍——中华民族解放先锋队。一九三六年一月平津学生的下乡宣传运动，是“一二·九”时代的知识青年和工农群众相结合的开端，这种结合以后又以工人夜校、农民夜校、乡村小学、家庭访问等形式进一步发展和巩固起来，直到抗日战争开始以后，广大的知识青年在党的号召下参加了敌后的抗日游击战争，而获得了更大的和更高度的发展。
    知识青年和工农群众相结合，对知识青年本身，是一个根本的锻炼和教育。在“一二·九”时代和以后的二十年中，无数的知识青年在党的领导下受到了这种教育，锻炼了和改造了自己，成为无产阶级队伍中的先锋战士。因为这些知识青年绝大多数都出身于剥削者的家庭或小有产者的家庭，他们的优点是其中有很多人对旧社会有着不满的情绪，对国家的前途和自己的前途感到没有出路，对反帝反封建的革命怀抱着热情和希望。正因为这样，许多革命的知识青年甘愿献身于革命的斗争，接受工人阶级的领导，并在斗争中提高自己和改造自己。但是在另一方面，知识青年本身也有许多缺点，他们的思想意识往往受了剥削阶级思想的严重侵蚀，他们的知识往往只是从书本上学来的一点东西，缺乏现实生活中实际的知识，他们往往存在着自高自大、抱负不凡的骄傲自满情绪和许多不切实际的空想，严重地阻碍着自己的学习和进步。只有在和工农群众相结合的斗争中，诚恳地接受工人阶级的领导，放下自己的架子，虚心地、认真地向工农群众学习，不断地警惕和克服自己在思想意识上、思想方法上的缺点和错误，才有可能使自己的革命思想常青，使自己不会落伍，使自己逐步向一个熟练的革命者发展。毛泽东同志教导我们：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”这个伟大的指示，应当时刻成为一切从知识分子出身的革命者的座右铭。
    我们现在所处的时代，已经和“一二·九”的时代有根本的不同。在“一二·九”以后的二十年中，中国的民族、民主革命已经取得了胜利，中华人民共和国已经建立，中国已经进入了一个新的革命时代——社会主义革命时代。这个革命比以前的民主革命更加深刻，更加伟大，通过国家的社会主义工业化建设和对农业、手工业以及资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，我们在不久的将来，就要胜利地建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    新中国的广大知识青年，在中国共产党的教育和培养之下，他们的政治觉悟比起“一二·九”时代的知识青年来，已经有了很大的提高，他们热烈地拥护中国共产党和毛泽东同志，拥护社会主义革命，并愿意为社会主义事业的彻底胜利而奋斗。但是，也还有这样一些知识青年，由于受到了剥削阶级思想的影响，看不起工农群众，不愿意和工农群众相结合，不愿意为工农群众服务。
    因此，在这“一二·九”运动二十周年纪念的时候，再一次提出“一二·九”时代所已经提出的“知识青年和工农相结合”的口号，对于当前的知识青年来说，仍然有现实的意义。这个口号将鼓舞目前新中国的一切知识青年，踏着“一二·九”时代的知识青年们在中国共产党领导下所已经走过的正确道路——和工农群众相结合的道路，在社会主义事业中英勇地前进。
