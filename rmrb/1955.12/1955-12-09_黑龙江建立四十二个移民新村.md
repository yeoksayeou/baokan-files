Heilongjiang Province, in eighteen counties including Keshan, Mishan, Luobei, and Jixian, has recently established forty-two new immigrant villages. Around the new immigrant villages, more than 27,200 hectares of wasteland have already been reclaimed.

These forty-two new immigrant villages will all be built into advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. The houses that have already been built are mainly the residences of cooperative members, offices, and collective dormitories and canteens for young land reclamation team members. Suitable locations have also been reserved for sports fields, clubs, clinics, and busy-season nurseries, which cannot be built temporarily. Some have also developed plans for greening the new villages. The new villages that have been built all have wide streets and tidy houses. In Tailai County's Changfa Village (new immigrant village), more than 300 houses have been built, and each new house has a spacious courtyard for immigrants to plant flowers and trees and set up small livestock and poultry sheds.

At present, the immigrants and young land reclamation team members in these new villages are actively engaged in winter production and preparations for next year's production.

    黑龙江建立四十二个移民新村
    黑龙江省克山、密山、萝北、集贤等十八个县，最近建立了四十二个移民新村。在移民新村的周围，已经开垦荒地二万七千二百多垧。
    这四十二个移民新村都将建成高级的农业生产合作社。现在已经建筑的房屋主要是社员们的住宅、办公室和青年垦荒队员们的集体宿舍和食堂。暂时不能修建的体育场、俱乐部、诊疗所、农忙托儿所等，也都留出了适当的位置。有的还作出了绿化新村的计划。已建成的新村都是街道宽敞，房屋整齐。泰来县长发屯（移民新村）建筑了三百多间住宅，每栋新房屋都有宽敞的院子供移民种植花草树木和设置小型畜舍、禽舍。
    目前，这些新村的移民和青年垦荒队队员们都在积极地进行冬季生产和明年生产的准备工作。
