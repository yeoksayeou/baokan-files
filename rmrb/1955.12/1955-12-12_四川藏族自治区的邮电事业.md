    In the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region, numerous postal workers traverse snowy mountains and grasslands, crossing forests and streams daily, delivering batches of official documents, newspapers, magazines, letters, and parcels to cities, factories, mines, pastoral areas, and villages.

    To date, the autonomous region has over 9,100 li of postal routes and thirteen postal and telecommunications bureaus. Postal service offices or agencies have also been established in sparsely populated areas such as Tangke, Mowa, and Langtang grasslands, and in 55 districts and townships including Mao’ergai in Songpan County. From January to November this year, postal and telecommunications organizations at all levels throughout the region distributed more than 500,000 copies of newspapers and magazines and delivered more than 860,000 pieces of mail. Since the complete opening of the Chengdu-Aba highway, mail delivery in various locations has become even more convenient. Aba, located at the border of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, can now receive various newspapers and magazines published in Chengdu three days prior.

    Shuajing Temple, the seat of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, as well as Lixian, Wenchuan, Maoxian, and Markang, have also installed wired telephones, enabling calls to be made to Chengdu and other parts of the country.

    四川藏族自治区的邮电事业
    在四川省藏族自治区境内，每天都有许多邮递员通过雪山草地，越过森林溪流，把一批批的公文、报刊、信件和包裹，送往城市、厂矿、牧区和农村。
    到现在为止，自治区境内已经有了长达九千一百多里的邮路和十三个邮电局。在人烟稀少的唐克、墨洼、埌塘等草地和松潘县的毛儿盖等五十五个区和乡，也设立了邮政营业处或代办所。从今年一月到十一月，全区各级邮电机构发行了五十多万份报刊，投送了八十六万多件信。成（都）阿（坝）公路全线通车后，各地递送邮件更方便了。地处四川、甘肃、青海三省边境的阿坝，现在已经可以看到三天前成都出版的各种报刊。
    自治区人民委员会所在地刷经寺和理县、汶川、茂县、马尔康等地，还装设了有线电话，可以经过成都和全国各地通话。
