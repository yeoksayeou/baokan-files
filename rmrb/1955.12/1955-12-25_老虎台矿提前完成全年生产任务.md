    Tiger Platform Mine Completes Annual Production Task Ahead of Schedule
    To the Editor:
    The Fushun Mining Bureau's Tiger Platform Mine completed its annual production task on December 5th, twenty-five days and sixteen hours ahead of schedule, saving the state 1,030,000 yuan. Now, all the mine's workers are full of confidence and plan to produce an additional 200,000 tons of raw coal for the country by the end of the year, save 200,000 yuan, and prepare for the completion of the 1956 production task.
    The Tiger Platform Mine's various tasks were not completed well in the first half of this year, with a shortfall of 18,000 tons of raw coal and a cost overrun of 580,000 yuan. After all the mine's workers engaged in the increased production and conservation movement in July, this situation was reversed. Up to November, the mine recovered a total of 11,180+ cubic meters of pit props, with the pit prop recovery rate increasing from an average of 10 percent in the first half of the year to 16.15 percent. In the labor emulation drive, the mine promoted advanced experiences such as deep drilling and regular cycles. In November, eight working faces achieved the progress and output of regular cycles. The 80-meter working face of the Fourth Team of the Sixth District also created a new record of producing more than 18,000 tons per month and achieving 27 cycles. Due to the conscientious implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions on improving the recovery rate, the mine recovered an additional 54,880 tons of raw coal up to November, and the recovery rate increased from 72 percent in the first half of the year to 77.8 percent, basically overcoming the phenomenon of coal loss.
    Now, the Tiger Platform Mine is exchanging work experiences through grassroots cadre meetings, striving to produce more coal in the future to meet the needs of national construction!

    老虎台矿提前完成全年生产任务编辑同志：
    抚顺矿务局老虎台矿已经在十二月五日提前二十五天又十六个小时完成了全年生产任务，并且为国家节约了一百零三万元。现在，全矿职工正满怀信心地要在年底再为国家增产原煤二十万吨，节约二十万元，并且为完成一九五六年的生产任务做好准备工作。
    老虎台矿今年上半年各项任务完成得不好，原煤欠产一万八千吨，成本超支五十八万元。七月份，全矿职工投入了增产节约运动以后，就扭转了这个局面。到十一月为止，全矿共回收坑木一万一千一百八十多立方公尺，坑木回收率从上半年的平均百分之十提高到百分之十六点一五。在劳动竞赛中，全矿推广了深打眼和正规循环等先进经验，十一月份有八个掌子达到了正规循环的进度和产量。六区四班八十公尺的掌子面还创造了月产一万八千多吨和达到二十七个循环的新成绩。由于认真地贯彻执行了苏联专家关于提高回采率的建议，全矿到十一月份多回采了五万四千八百八十吨原煤，回采率由上半年的百分之七十二提高到百分之七十七点八，基本上克服了丢失煤的现象。
    现在老虎台矿正通过基层干部会议交流各项工作经验，争取在今后要增产更多的煤炭，来满足国家建设需要！舒陶荣地
