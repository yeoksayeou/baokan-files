    Distributing Share Funds According to Land Contributed to the Cooperative
    He Cheng
    Share funds are like the capital that farmers contribute when joining a cooperative. Without capital, there can be no production, no purchase of livestock, farm implements, and other means of production. Therefore, cooperative members should contribute appropriate share funds.
    In the past, some agricultural production cooperatives did not levy funds from their members, and had no capital at all. The production expenses needed each year, such as seeds and fodder, were borrowed from the members in the spring and returned to them in the fall (some with interest, some without), and then borrowed again the following spring. This made it difficult to arrange production, and the management committee often had to handle borrowing and repayment, which was very troublesome. This was detrimental to the cooperative's production and not beneficial to the members. In the past, there were also some agricultural production cooperatives that bought livestock and farm implements from their members, always using money from the total income of the cooperative, without levying anything from the members. After paying the money each year, the members received very little in distribution; some cooperatives, in order to distribute more to the members, did not pay the owners of livestock and farm implements on time, losing the cooperative's credibility.
    What are Share Funds?
    When a cooperative levies share funds from its members, it can solve the problems mentioned above. According to the draft model charter, there are two types of share funds: one is the production expense share fund, which is the commonly referred to production base; the other is the collectivized share fund, which is the payment used to purchase the members' livestock, farm implements, and other means of production. Share funds do not accrue interest, and are recorded under each member household. If a member wants to withdraw from the cooperative one day, they can clearly take their share with them.
    Some people feel that paying share funds is simply handing over their money and belongings to the "public" for nothing. They feel that with this money, it would be better to lend it out or deposit it in a bank or credit cooperative to earn interest. They also fear that if the cooperative is not run well, production decreases, or it collapses, wouldn't their money and belongings be "lost" or "wasted"? You must understand that whether a cooperative can be run well depends on whether each member loves the cooperative and whether everyone works together with one heart. In the past, when individual households operated independently, this money and these belongings were still indispensable. Why would they want to "save" these things after joining the cooperative? If every member household is calculating and unwilling to pay share funds for fear of "wasting" them, and the cooperative has no funds, how can it carry out production? If there is insufficient funds and production cannot be carried out well, wouldn't everyone suffer? If the cooperative borrows money, wouldn't the interest paid be distributed among each member household? If the cooperative has sufficient funds, everyone's income can increase, which is much better than earning interest on individual savings. Of course, it is even more wrong to lend money at high interest rates to exploit others. Of course, after paying share funds, if there is still money left over, it is best to deposit it in a bank or credit cooperative; you can also invest in the cooperative.
      How Much Share Funds Should Be Levied?
    An agricultural production cooperative should not levy too little share funds, as this would leave the cooperative without enough funds to carry out production; however, it should also not levy too much, as the members would not be able to afford it. To ensure that the levies are appropriate, the draft model charter stipulates the following principles: on the one hand, the levy should be based on the cooperative's production needs, and on the other hand, the majority of members should be able to afford it. Share funds do not have to be paid in full by members upon joining the cooperative. The production expense share fund is the value of seeds, fertilizers, fodder, etc., that the cooperative must use for production in a year. For the same piece of land, how much seed and fertilizer did local farmers generally use in the past year? Members should contribute that amount. What if some cooperatives have set production increase plans and need to use more seeds and fertilizers? If the members are willing to contribute more, of course they can; if everyone is unwilling, they can find other ways (such as mobilizing members to invest and the cooperative paying interest). Generally speaking, the production expense share fund should be paid in full upon joining the cooperative (if it is really unaffordable, in places where two or three crops are grown in a year, it can also be paid in two or three installments within a year). If the cooperative does not yet have publicly raised livestock, the fodder can be temporarily exempted, and paid later when there is publicly raised livestock. The collectivized share fund is used to purchase the members' livestock, farm implements, and other means of production. In principle, the members should contribute the total value of the livestock, farm implements, etc., that are valued when joining the cooperative. If the livestock and farm implements are not valued and collectivized for the time being, the collectivized share fund can also be temporarily exempted. When they are valued and collectivized, because the amount of money is large, the cooperative must repay the original owners in installments, and the collectivized share fund can also be paid in installments. The cooperative pays the original owners in full over several years, and the collectivized share fund can also be paid in full over several years. (Generally speaking, it is better to pay in full over three years, and no more than five years at most.) If there are many livestock and farm implements that are valued and collectivized, and the amount of money is too large, and many members cannot afford it, what should be done? The draft model charter stipulates that in this situation, not all of the price should be repaid with collectivized share funds. The share funds contributed by the members should only account for a large portion or a portion of the valuation; the amount that is not enough should be made up for with the cooperative's public accumulation fund. Some poor farmers, who in the past scraped together a living by farming on their own, were not only exploited, but also did not farm the land well. Now they really cannot afford to pay share funds, or can only pay a portion. What should be done? The draft model charter stipulates that in this situation, they can apply to the bank for a poor peasant cooperative fund loan to pay off the share funds upon joining the cooperative. The state allocates this loan specifically to help this group of poor farmers solve the problem of not being able to afford or fully pay the share funds upon joining the cooperative.
    How to Distribute Share Funds?
    How should the share funds be distributed among the member households? The draft model charter stipulates: "Share funds are generally distributed among the members according to the land contributed to the cooperative." Some members with more land ask: Why is it distributed this way? Isn't it unfair? It should be made clear that this distribution is reasonable. Generally speaking, before joining the cooperative, people with more land also used more seeds, fertilizers, livestock, farm implements, and so on. In the past, those who invested more and had higher actual yields have already been taken care of when assessing the yield of the land contributed to the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, the land remuneration obtained is calculated based on the yield contributed. Those with more land and higher yields, although they contribute more share funds, also receive more land remuneration! Originally, land can grow grains, cotton, and hemp because of people's labor; land itself existed before there were people, and was not created by anyone. In theory, everything produced should be distributed entirely according to labor. The fact that land is still distributed dividends is already taking care of people with more land. People with more land want to receive more land remuneration, and more land requires more seeds, fertilizers, livestock, farm implements, and so on. Why is it said that it is unfair to distribute share funds according to land?
    What if the land remuneration in some cooperatives is relatively low, and distributing share funds according to land is equivalent to having no land remuneration? The draft model charter stipulates that in this situation, a portion of the share funds can also be distributed according to labor. Some cooperatives have very low land remuneration, and some cooperatives have no land remuneration at all. How should the share funds be distributed? According to the draft model charter, it should be distributed entirely according to labor. Because, in this situation, the land is equal to or almost equal to being wholly owned by the cooperative, of course the original owners of the land cannot be asked to distribute share funds according to land. However, it is very wrong for some cooperatives to implement the method of distributing share funds entirely according to labor even though the land remuneration is not low. As mentioned earlier, since the land is distributed dividends, and the amount of dividends is not low, this is sufficient care for members with more land. Why distribute share funds according to labor? This practice, which harms members with less land and more labor, should be corrected in accordance with the provisions of the draft model charter. Some collectivized share funds are used in animal husbandry, forestry, or sideline occupations, which have little or no relationship with land, and other distribution methods can also be stipulated.
    Does collecting share funds only mean wanting money and not goods? The draft model charter stipulates: The cooperative should uniformly calculate it in terms of money. Because the amount of seeds, fertilizers, etc., and the quality of the items are different for each member household, and the amount of cash is also different; it is inconvenient for everyone to stipulate how much of various items to contribute, and it is also difficult for the cooperative to calculate. However, when members pay the production expense share fund, they can pay in cash, or they can use seeds, fertilizers, etc., to offset the payment. When members pay the collectivized share fund, members who have livestock, farm implements, etc., to sell to the cooperative can use the price they should receive to offset the share they should contribute. Any excess should be returned to them, and any shortfall should be made up by them.
    What if a member has excess fertilizer after paying the share fund in full? According to the draft model charter, the cooperative has the priority to buy this fertilizer; that is, if the cooperative needs this fertilizer, the member should sell it to the cooperative (the cooperative can pay after the harvest); if the cooperative does not need it, it can be sold or given to others.
    Invest in the Cooperative as Much as Possible
    Some people say that since a cooperative has been established, I want to rely on the cooperative; if the cooperative does not have money, it can rely on the state, and can take out loans from state banks. That's right, the state is going to issue agricultural loans; however, the amount of this loan has certain limits. At present, the state is concentrating its main efforts on building industry, and many large factories are being built, including factories that manufacture tractors, automobiles, various agricultural machines, and chemical fertilizers; building such large factories requires a lot of funds, so the state's loans to agricultural cooperatives must have a restriction on their use (for example, if the production of an agricultural production cooperative develops and needs to carry out some relatively large-scale construction, but lacks funds, it can take out a loan from a state bank). Furthermore, now the agricultural cooperativization movement is developing greatly, and hundreds of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives have been established across the country, and many new cooperatives will be established before the spring plowing next year; if they all have to take out loans from the state to solve the problem of production funds when they start their cooperatives, then the state will have to allocate a loan that is much larger than the current one, and if this is done, fewer large factories will be built. In fact, this is impossible. From another point of view, doing so is not beneficial to agricultural production cooperatives. Haven't many such things happened before: after the agricultural production cooperative harvested the crops, it calculated that the yield had indeed increased, and the members were all overjoyed; when it came to the distribution, they calculated in detail and found that because they had to repay too many loans and interest, the members' income did not increase, and in some cases even decreased, resulting in empty joy. It can be seen that simply relying on state loans is not a good method.
    The cooperative must increase production and expand production, but the share funds contributed by members are based on the past production level, which is not enough according to the expanded production plan, and the public accumulation fund is also not enough, or the cooperative has just been established and has no public accumulation fund, what should be done? The draft model charter stipulates: When such a situation is encountered, members should invest in the cooperative as much as they can. Investment is different from paying share funds. Share funds are fixed, and every member household must pay them; investment is made freely to the cooperative after the share funds have been paid in full. Those with more money can invest more, and those with less money can invest less. The cooperative does not pay interest on share funds, but generally pays interest on members' investments. Share funds can only be taken away when withdrawing from the cooperative, and investments must be returned to the investors within one to three years. It is beneficial to both the public and private interests for members to invest their surplus money and grain in the cooperative. If everyone invests more, the cooperative will have more production funds, which can be used to apply more fertilizer, engage in more sideline occupations, and strive for increased production. If the entire cooperative increases production, the income of each member will also increase. Moreover, there is interest to be earned on investments, and investing surplus money in the cooperative can turn dead money into active money.

    按照入社的土地分摊股份基金
    何成
    股份基金，好比农民入社的时候拿出来的本钱。没有本钱不能生产，不能购置牲畜、农具等生产资料，所以，社员应该分摊适当的股份基金。
    过去，有些农业生产合作社不向社员摊派基金，一点本钱也没有，每年需要的种籽、草料等生产费都是在春天向社员借，到秋天还给社员（有的出利息，有的不出），下一年春天再借。这样作，生产不好安排，管理委员会常常要办借和还的事情，非常麻烦。这对社里的生产不利，对社员也没有好处。过去，也有一些农业生产合作社，向社员收买牲畜、农具，总是在全社的收入当中出钱，也不向社员摊派一点。每年付了钱以后，社员分得的东西就很少了；有的合作社为了给社员多分一些，就不按时把价款还给牲口、农具的主人，丧失了合作社的信用。
    什么是股份基金
    合作社向社员摊派了股份基金，就能够解决上面说的这些问题了。按照示范章程草案的规定，股份基金分两种：一种是生产费股份基金，这就是平常所说的生产底垫；一种是公有化股份基金，这就是用来收买社员的牲口、农具等生产资料的价款。股份基金不行利息，分记在各户社员名下。万一有一天哪个社员要退社，他还可以一清二楚地把他自己的那一份带走。
    有些人觉得，交了股份基金，就是白白地把自己的钱和东西交给“公家”了。他们觉得，有这些钱，不如放出去或者存在银行、信用社里得利息。他们还害怕：交了股份基金，万一社办不好，减产了，垮台了，岂不是把这些钱和东西“赔”了、“瞎”了？要知道，社能不能办好，就看每一个社员是不是爱社，就看大家是不是同心合力。过去一家一户分散经营的时候，这些钱和东西也是非用不可的。为什么入了社就想把这些“省掉”呢？要是每户社员都在交股份基金上打算盘，怕把股金“瞎”了，不愿意交，社里没有资金，怎么搞生产呢？资金不足，生产搞不好，还不是大家都吃亏？如果让合作社去借钱，出的利息还不是要分摊在每户社员身上？社里资金充足了，大家的收入都能增加，这要比个人存钱得利息强得多。如果拿钱放高利贷，剥削别人，那就更不对了。当然，交了股份基金以后，如果还有钱，最好是存在银行、信用社里；也可以向社里投资。
      应该摊派多少股份基金
    农业生产合作社摊派股份基金，不能过少，过少了合作社没有足够的资金进行生产；但是，也不能过多，过多了社员出不起。为了摊派的很合适，示范章程草案上规定了这样的原则：一方面要根据社里生产的需要，一方面也要多数社员能出得起。股份基金并不是要社员在入社的时候一次完全交出来。生产费股份基金是社里一年生产上必须用的种籽、肥料和草料等等的价款。同样的土地，当地一般农民过去一年用多少种籽和肥料，社员就交多少。有些社里订了增产计划，需要多用一些种籽和肥料怎么办？社员都愿意多交一些，当然可以；大家不愿意，也可以另想办法（比如可以发动社员投资，由社里给出利息）。一般地说，生产费股份基金应该在入社的时候交清（如果实在交不起，在一年种两季三季的地方，也可以在一年内分两三次交清）。如果社里现在还没有公养的耕畜，草料就可以暂时不交，等以后有了公养的耕畜再交。公有化股份基金是用来收买社员的耕畜、农具等等生产资料的。原则上说，作价入社的耕畜、农具等等总共值多少钱，社员就分摊多少公有化股份基金。如果耕畜农具暂时还不折价入社，公有化股份基金也就可以暂时不交。折价入社的时候，因为价款很多，社里不能不分期偿还原主，公有化股份基金也可以分期交。社里分几年付清价款给原主，公有化股份基金也可以分几年交清。（一般地说，分三年交清比较好，至多不要超过五年。）如果折价入社的耕畜、农具很多，这笔钱数目太大，许多社员负担不起，怎么办呢？示范章程草案上规定，在这种情形下面，不能把全部价款都用公有化股份基金来还，社员分摊的股份基金，只能占折价的大部分或部分；不够的数目，用社里的公积金来补足。有些贫苦农民，过去自己种地是东挪西凑的，不但受人剥削，还没把地种好，现在实在拿不出股份基金，或者只能拿一部分，怎么办？示范章程草案规定，有了这种情形，可以向银行申请贫农合作基金贷款来交清。国家拨出这笔贷款，就是专门为了帮助这一部分贫苦农民解决交不起或者交不清入社股份基金的问题。
    怎样分摊股份基金
    各户社员怎样分摊股份基金呢？示范章程草案上规定：“股份基金一般地由社员按照入社的土地分摊。”有些土地多的社员问：为什么要这样摊呢？不大公平吧？应该弄清楚，这样分摊是合理的。一般地说，在入社以前，土地比较多的人用的种籽、肥料、耕畜、农具等等东西也比较多。过去投资多，实产量高的，在评定入社土地的产量的时候已经作了照顾。入社以后所得的土地报酬是根据入社产量来计算的，土地多、产量大的，虽然多摊股份基金，可是得的土地报酬也多呀！本来，土地上能生长五谷棉麻，是人们劳动的结果；土地本身是在还没有人的时候就有了的，不是任何人创造出来的。按道理讲，生产出来的东西完全归劳动力分配才对。现在土地还分红，已经是照顾了地多的人了。地多的人要多分土地报酬，地多就需要比较多的种籽、肥料、耕畜、农具等等东西，为什么说按土地分摊股份基金不公平呢？
    有些合作社的土地报酬比较低，按土地分摊股份基金就等于没有了土地报酬，怎么办？示范章程草案规定，在这种情形下面，股份基金也可以按劳动力分摊一部分。有的社土地报酬很低，有的社土地没有报酬，怎么分摊股份基金？按示范章程草案的规定应该完全由劳动力来分摊。因为，在这种情形下面，土地已经等于或者差不多等于全社公有的了，当然不能叫土地的原主按土地分摊股份基金。但是，有些合作社的土地报酬并不低，也实行全部按劳力分摊股金的办法，这就非常不对了。正像前面所说的，土地既然分红，分红的数量又不低，这就是对于土地多的社员作了足够的照顾，为什么还按劳力分摊股金呢？这种损害土地少、劳力多的社员的作法，应该按照示范章程草案的规定改过来。有些公有化股份基金是用在畜牧业、林业或者副业方面的，跟土地没关系或者关系比较少，也可以另外规定分摊办法。
    收股份基金是不是只要钱不要物件？示范章程草案规定：社里要统一按钱计算。因为每户社员的种籽、肥料等等东西的多少不同，质量不同，现钱的多少也不同；规定交各种实物多少，对大家来说不方便，对社里来说也不好算账。不过，社员交生产费股份基金的时候，可以交现钱，也可以拿种籽、肥料等等东西来抵交。社员交公有化股份基金的时候，有耕畜、农具等等东西卖给社里的社员，可以拿他应得的价款来抵交他应该摊的那一份，多余的要退给他，不够的要他补齐。
    社员交足股份基金以后，如果还有多余的肥料，怎么办？按示范章程草案的规定，社里有买这些肥料的优先权；也就是说，社里如果需要这些肥料，社员应该把它卖给社里（社里可以在收庄稼以后给钱）；社里不需要，才可以卖给别人或者送给别人。
    尽可能地向社里投资
    有人说，既然办了合作社，我就要靠合作社；合作社没有钱，可以靠国家，可以向国家银行贷款。不错，国家是要发放农业贷款的；但是，这项贷款的数量有一定的限度。眼前国家正在集中主要力量建设工业，要盖很多的大工厂，其中包括制造拖拉机、汽车、各种农业机械和化学肥料的工厂；建立这样的大工厂就得花费很多很多的资金，这样，国家对农业社的贷款在用途上就不能不有个限制
  （比如农业生产社的生产发展了，需要进行一些比较大的建设，可是资金缺乏，是可以向国家银行贷款的）。再说，现在农业合作化运动大发展了，全国各地又建立了几十万个农业生产合作社，到明年春耕以前还要建立许多新社；要是它们在开始办社的时候就都要向国家贷款来解决生产资金问题，那国家就非要再拨出一笔比现在多得多的贷款不可，要是这样办，就得少盖大工厂。事实上，这是办不到的。从另一方面来看，这样做对农业生产合作社也没有好处。不是曾经发生过不少这样的事情吗：农业生产合作社收了庄稼以后，算一算，产量确实是增加了，社员们个个欢天喜地；到分配的时候再一细算账，才发现因为要偿还过多的贷款和利息，社员的收益并没有增加，有的反倒减少了，结果是空欢喜了一场。可见单纯依靠国家贷款并不是好办法。
    社里必须增加生产、扩大生产，可是社员分摊股份基金是按过去的生产水平交的，按扩大生产的计划来说就不够用了，再加上公积金也不够，或者社刚办起来，还没有公积金，怎么办？示范章程草案上规定：遇到这样的情况，社员就应该尽自己的力量向社里投资。投资同交股份基金不一样。股份基金是有定数的，每户社员都要交；投资是在股份基金交足以后，自由向社里投的，钱多的可以多投，钱少的可以少投。社里对股份基金不给利息，对社员的投资一般地说要给利息。股份基金在退社的时候才可以带走，投资在一年到三年以内就要退给投资的人。社员有余钱、余粮向合作社投资，是对公对私都有利的事。大家多投资，合作社生产资金多了，就可以多下肥料、多搞副业，争取多增产，全社增产了，每个社员的收入也会增加。而且，投资还有利息可得，余钱投到社里，就能把死钱变活钱。
