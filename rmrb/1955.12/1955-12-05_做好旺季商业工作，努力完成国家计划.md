    Do a Good Job in Peak Season Commercial Work and Strive to Complete the National Plan
    Wang Lei, Vice Minister of Commerce

    In the past eleven months, state-owned commerce has basically guaranteed market needs and has actively purchased agricultural products. However, there is still much work to be done better in the current peak season of purchasing and sales to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's state-owned commercial plan.

    Regarding the sales plan, only 71.49 percent of the annual plan was completed from January to October this year (compared to 76.05 percent in the same period last year). The progress in completing the plans of department stores, cotton cloth companies, and several larger provinces and cities, which account for a large proportion of the sales plan, is very poor; many industrial products with sufficient supply, especially daily-use industrial products, have not completed the sales plan. In terms of procurement, the amount of cotton and tobacco leaves coming on the market after the autumn harvest is very large, and the quarterly plan can be overfulfilled; however, the situation for pig procurement is not good. Regarding profit delivery plans, only 60.83 percent of the annual plan was completed by the end of the third quarter. The implementation of capital and expense plans is also not good, mainly because the sales plan was completed so poorly and management was lagging behind.

    At present, we must further improve the supply work during the peak season and the procurement of agricultural products, make full use of favorable opportunities, and strive to overfulfill and comprehensively complete the fourth-quarter plan and better complete the annual plan, and prepare for the spring peak season. All staff in the state-owned commercial system must thoroughly implement the Central Committee's instructions on doing a good job in agricultural product procurement and industrial product supply during the autumn harvest peak season market.

    First, we should continue to raise the awareness of commercial staff at all levels, especially leading staff, about this year's peak season. The current situation of agricultural product listing fully confirms that, except for individual areas, major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds are having bumper harvests. According to preliminary estimates, the amount of grain and industrial raw materials purchased from rural areas since the autumn harvest has increased by more than one-third compared to last year, and a large portion of agricultural products will still be purchased in November and December. Due to the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, the number of grain sales in the rural market has greatly decreased compared to last year, and this part of the purchasing power will be transferred to the market for daily-use industrial products. This situation is not yet very obvious, because many agricultural production cooperatives have not yet settled accounts and distributed profits, and farmers in some areas are still worried about showing off their wealth, being accused of waste, and failing to join the cooperative when buying daily-use consumer goods. However, this part of purchasing power will eventually manifest itself. In short, the current arrival of the upsurge in agricultural cooperation, the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, and this year's agricultural bumper harvest have brought many new situations and problems to state-owned commerce, which should be carefully and promptly studied and resolved.

    Currently, many cadres do not recognize the new situation in rural areas, believing that this year's peak season will not be prosperous, and they are not paying close attention to the procurement of agricultural products, mistakenly believing that these commodities cannot run away and will be sold to the state sooner or later. In the work of organizing the source of goods, there is still a fear of stockpiling but not of being out of stock. These erroneous ideas are a major obstacle to doing a good job in the current purchasing and sales work and must be quickly and thoroughly corrected. At the same time, we must also educate grassroots cadres and the broad masses of farmers, so that they know that the state encourages farmers to save money and use it to purchase means of production in order to continue expanding reproduction; however, they should also know that improving people's living standards and improving people's lives on the basis of production development is one of the basic policies of the Party and the People's Government, and that it is completely legitimate and should be encouraged for farmers to purchase the necessary daily-use consumer goods.

    Second, we must continue to strengthen the supply of goods. How to quickly deliver goods to farmers is currently the focus of supply work. The sales plans for major daily-use industrial products, such as sugar, rubber shoes, towels, socks, general merchandise, and coal, were very poorly completed by state-owned commerce in the third quarter and October, while the inventory of these commodities is abundant, and the market also shows a shortage phenomenon. This is mainly because the commodities were not well distributed to grassroots cooperatives and distribution stores in conjunction with supply and marketing cooperatives, so that the broad masses of farmers could choose to purchase them in a timely manner. In order to reverse this situation, most provinces, cities, and special districts have already begun to take effective measures, some have established peak season commercial work offices, and some have organized hundreds of people to go deep into grassroots units to assist them in doing a good job in peak season supply work – mainly by holding internal exchange meetings in special districts and counties, holding small-scale material exchange meetings in primary markets, helping supply and marketing cooperatives increase the variety of goods, appropriately increasing inventory, and organizing peddlers to go to the countryside, so that goods can meet the broad masses of farmers. The state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Yucheng County, Shandong Province, held a joint meeting, clarified their thinking, and expanded their purchases, and the shortage situation in rural areas was basically reversed. In order to enable more commodities to meet farmers, allow farmers to choose and purchase, ensure supply to farmers, and expand sales, state-owned department stores can go deep into market towns to carry out wholesale business, and department stores can set up special counters for retail sales for commodities that supply and marketing cooperatives do not sell. It is worth noting that recently, when cooperatives began to purchase larger quantities from state-owned county stores, some local state-owned companies experienced shortages of goods and incomplete varieties. Therefore, state-owned companies should continue to strengthen the rational allocation of goods in conjunction with the market situation in the next two or three months, make the goods more suitable, make full use of the potential of inventory goods, and replenish goods appropriately according to plan. In terms of goods allocation, we must resolutely implement the policy of giving priority to supplying industrial products that are needed in both urban and rural areas to rural areas, helping cooperatives select colors and patterns; resolutely stop allocating commodities that are not needed in rural areas to rural areas, so as to avoid stockpiling.

    Third, we must continue to strengthen the procurement of agricultural products and strive to overfulfill this year's fourth-quarter plan. This year's agricultural products have had a bumper harvest, and farmers are selling them enthusiastically. In some areas, due to poor preparation for the initial procurement, there were phenomena of farmers lining up and squeezing to sell. This situation was quickly eliminated, and the procurement progress of most commodities has been faster than last year. At present, we must immediately overcome blind complacency and a slack mood. For example, although the cotton procurement plan for the fourth quarter can be overfulfilled, much work needs to be done to ensure the completion of the entire procurement plan, because many agricultural production cooperatives and farmers have pre-sold cotton in the fourth quarter that would have been sold next year. The more we go further in the procurement work, the more difficult it will be, it is very dangerous to be blindly complacent without seeing this, we must strive to complete more procurement plans in advance. The procurement plans for flue-cured tobacco and live pigs have not been completed well, and the procurement of oil crops has just begun, which requires us to work diligently. To do a good job in agricultural product procurement, we must also correctly implement the procurement policies for various agricultural products. For example, in cotton procurement, we must implement the preferential policies for cotton farmers to purchase grain and cloth, and implement the regulations on cotton clothing fraction rate; when procuring oil crops, we must implement the policy of more production, more gain, and more retention, processing oil for farmers; when procuring live pigs, we must implement the policies of assigning raising and purchasing and retaining meat and oil. In addition, we must quickly improve receiving, processing, transferring, and storage work, so as to meet the requirements of farmers who can sell agricultural products at any time. Actively organize seed cotton processing and eliminate the phenomenon of mold and rot caused by seed cotton stockpiling. Rationally adjust and arrange the annual oil processing and transportation plan. In storage and transportation work, we especially need to be vigilant and do a good job in preventing special agents, fire, and theft, and we cannot be negligent in any way.

    Fourth, while expanding sales and strengthening procurement, we must also strengthen the operation and management of enterprises to better complete the annual profit plan. Only 60 percent of the annual profit plan was completed in the first three quarters of this year, mainly because the sales plan was not completed, capital turnover was slow, expenses were overspent too much, and losses were large. From January to March, only because the expense level exceeded the annual plan by 1.3 percentage points, the country paid two hundred million yuan less in profits. In terms of capital utilization, the capital turnover period in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Anhui, and other provinces was within 100 days in the first half of this year; while it was between 150 and 170 days in Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces and regions; and it was between 170 and 190 days in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and other provinces, which is obviously unreasonable.

    Fifth, in order to do a good job in peak season commercial work and better complete the national plan, it is also necessary to replenish and adjust grassroots wholesale institutions and agricultural product procurement institutions, and replenish staff to adapt to the requirements of organizational downward extension and increased procurement tasks. At the same time, we must also help cooperatives to carry out wholesale and retail business in rural areas, and make arrangements and utilization of private commerce, and strengthen the leadership and supervision of private commerce.

    The time to complete the 1955 plan is pressing. All employees of the commercial departments should take active action, work diligently, pay attention to solving the above-mentioned problems, so as to do a good job in peak season commercial work, strive to complete this year's state-owned commercial plan, and prepare conditions for next year's work.

    做好旺季商业工作，努力完成国家计划
    商业部副部长　王磊
    在过去的十一个月中，国营商业基本上保证了市场需要，并且积极地采购了农产品。但是，目前旺季购销业务中还有许多工作需要做得更好，才能保证全面完成今年国营商业计划。
    在销售计划方面，今年一至十月份只完成了年度计划的百分之七一点四九（去年同期完成百分之七六点○五）。占销售计划比重较大的百货、纱布等公司和若干较大的省市计划完成的进度很差；很多货源充足的工业品，特别是日用工业品没有完成销售计划。在收购方面，棉花、烟叶秋后上市量很大，可以超额完成季度计划；生猪收购的情况则很不好。在利润上缴计划方面，到第三季末只完成年度计划的百分之六○点八三。资金和费用计划的执行情况也不好，主要原因是销售计划完成得太差和经营管理工作落后。
    当前必须进一步做好旺季供应工作和农产品的采购工作，充分利用有利时机，为超额地全面地完成第四季度计划和更好的完成年度计划而努力，并为明春旺季作好准备。国营商业系统全体工作人员，必须很好地贯彻执行中央关于做好秋收旺季市场农产品收购和工业品供应工作的指示。
    首先应该继续提高各级商业工作人员，特别是领导工作人员对今年旺季的认识。目前农产品上市情况完全证实了：除个别地区外，主要农产品粮食、棉花、油料等是丰收的。据初步估算，秋收以来，从农村采购的粮食和工业原料比去年增加三分之一以上，而且还有很大的一部分农产品要在十一、十二两个月采购。由于粮食“三定”政策的贯彻执行，农村市场的粮食销售数字较去年大大减少，这一部分购买力将会转移于日用工业品的市场。目前这个情况还没有很明显地表现出来，原因是许多农业生产合作社还没有算账分配，若干地区农民目前在购买日用消费品方面还有怕露富、怕说浪费、怕入不了社的顾虑。但是，这一部分购买力将来总是会表现出来的。总之，目前农业合作化的高潮到来，粮食“三定”政策的贯彻执行，以及今年农业丰收，给国营商业带来许多新的情况和问题，应该很好地及时地加以研究和解决。
    现在不少干部对当前农村新的情况没有认识，认为今年旺季旺不起来，对于农产品的采购也抓得不紧，错误地认为这些商品跑不了，迟早要卖给国家。在组织货源工作中，还有怕积压不怕脱销的思想。这些错误思想是做好当前购销工作的重大障碍，必须迅速彻底地加以纠正。同时，也要教育基层干部和广大农民，使他们知道国家是鼓励农民省吃俭用，鼓励农民把更多的钱购买生产资料，以便继续扩大再生产的；但是，也使他们知道在生产发展的基础上提高人民生活水平，改善人民生活，是党和人民政府的基本政策之一，农民购买必需的日用消费品是完全正当的和应该的。
    其次，要继续加强商品的供应工作。如何把商品迅速地送到农民手里，目前是供应工作的重点。国营商业第三季度和十月份，主要日用工业品，如糖、胶鞋、毛巾、袜子、百杂货、煤炭等销售计划完成得都很差，而这些商品的库存是充裕的，市场上也呈现脱销现象。这主要是没有很好地结合供销合作社把商品分配到基层社和分销店，以便广大农民及时选购。为了扭转这个局面，现在多数省、市、专区已经开始采取有效措施，有的成立了旺季商业工作办公室，有的组织了几百人深入基层单位，协助他们做好旺季的供应工作——主要是以专区和县为单位召开内部交流会，召开初级市场小型物资交流会，帮助供销合作社增加商品品种，适当地增加库存，组织货郎担下乡等，使货物能同广大农民见面。山东禹城县国营商业部门和供销合作社共同开了会，搞通了思想，扩大了进货，农村脱销情况就基本扭转了。为了能使更多的商品同农民见面，让农民选购，保证对农民的供应并扩大推销，国营百货公司可以深入到集镇开展批发业务，凡供销合作社不卖的商品，百货公司可以设专柜零售。值得注意的是，最近当合作社开始较大量地向国营县商店进货的时候，有的地方国营公司却又发生了货源不足、品种不全等现象。因此，国营公司应结合今后两三个月的市场情况，继续加强商品的合理调拨工作，使商品更加对路，充分运用库存商品的潜力，并且有计划地适当补货。在货源分配方面，必须坚决执行凡是城乡都需要的工业品优先供应农村的政策，帮助合作社挑选花色；凡是农村不需要的商品，坚决停止往农村调拨，以免造成积压。
    第三、要继续加强农产品的采购工作，争取超额完成今年第四季度计划。今年农产品丰收，农民出售踊跃。在某些地区，由于初期收购的准备工作做得不好，曾发生农民排队挤售现象。这种情况很快就被消除，多数商品的收购进度已经快过去年。目前，要立即克服盲目自满和松懈的情绪。例如，第四季度的棉花收购计划虽可以超额完成，但是要保证完成全部收购计划还要做许多工作，因为许多农业生产合作社和农民在第四季度提前出售了明年才出售的棉花，愈往后收购工作愈艰苦，看不到这一点而盲目自满是很危险的，必须争取提前完成更多的收购计划。烤烟、生猪的收购计划完成得不好，油料收购工作还刚开始，这更要求我们兢兢业业地工作。要做好农产品收购工作，还必须正确执行各种农产品的采购政策。例如，在收购棉花中，要执行棉农购买粮食和布匹的优待政策、执行棉花衣分率的规定；在收购油料作物的时候，要执行多产多得、增产多留的政策，代农民加工油料；在收购生猪的时候，要执行派养派购和留肉留油的政策。此外，要迅速改进接收、加工、调运和保管工作，做到满足目前农民随时可以出售农产品的要求。积极组织籽棉加工，消灭因籽棉积压而造成霉烂的现象。合理调整安排全年油料加工调运计划。在保管调运工作中，尤其需要提高警惕，做好防特、防火、防盗工作，不能有任何麻痹大意。
    第四、在扩大推销和加强收购工作的同时，还须加强企业的经营管理工作，更好地完成年度利润计划。今年前三个季度只完成年度利润计划的百分之六十，主要原因是销售计划没有完成，资金周转缓慢，费用超支过多，损失较大等。一至三季度仅因费用水平超过年度计划百分之一点三，全国即少上缴利润两亿元。在资金运用方面，今年上半年资金周转期，江苏、浙江、广东、安徽等省都在一百天以内；而广西、内蒙古、四川、云南等省区则在一百五十至一百七十天之间；黑龙江、吉林、辽宁等省则在一百七十至一百九十天之间，这显然是不合理的。
    第五、为了做好旺季商业工作，更好地完成国家计划，还要充实和调整基层批发机构和农产品采购机构，充实工作人员以适应机构下伸和收购任务增加的要求。同时还要帮助合作社开展农村的批发和零售业务，并且对私营商业加以安排利用，加强对私营商业的领导和监督。
    完成一九五五年计划的时间是紧迫的，全体商业部门的职工应该积极行动起来，兢兢业业，注意解决上述各种问题，以做好旺季商业工作，努力完成今年的国营商业计划，并为明年工作准备条件。
