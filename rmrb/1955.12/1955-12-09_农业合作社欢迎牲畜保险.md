    Agricultural Cooperatives Welcome Livestock Insurance
    Since last year, the People's Insurance Company of China has been focusing on handling rural livestock insurance in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, which has been welcomed by agricultural production cooperatives. According to the insurance company's recent statistics, by the first half of this year, 386 districts in 90 counties of the three provinces have carried out this business, insuring more than 200,000 head of livestock. In the 72 districts of Liaoning Province, 84.6 percent of agricultural production cooperatives have participated in livestock insurance.
    Over the past year, the People's Insurance Company of China has paid more than 670,000 yuan in compensation for dead livestock, timely compensating the farmers who participated in livestock insurance for the losses they suffered after the death of their livestock. While carrying out business work, the insurance company's staff also often cooperate with veterinarians to go to the countryside to inspect livestock disaster prevention work, carry out publicity and education on cherishing livestock, introduce disaster prevention knowledge to farmers, and help many agricultural cooperatives establish livestock feeding management and service systems.
    In order to cooperate with the agricultural cooperativization movement, the People's Insurance Company of China, in addition to continuing to handle livestock insurance in the northeastern provinces, plans to handle livestock insurance in the twelve provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guangxi, and Shaanxi this winter and next spring, with agricultural production cooperatives as the main target.

    农业合作社欢迎牲畜保险
    中国人民保险公司自去年以来在辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省有重点地办理农村牲畜保险，受到农业生产合作社的欢迎。据保险公司最近统计，到今年上半年止，三个省已经有九十个县的三百八十六个区开展了这项业务，共承保了牲畜二十多万头。辽宁省的七十二个区内，有百分之八十四点六的农业生产合作社参加了牲畜保险。
    一年多来，中国人民保险公司支付了死亡牲畜赔款六十七万多元，及时补偿了参加牲畜保险的农民在牲畜死亡后所遭受的损失。保险公司的工作人员在开展业务工作的时候，还经常配合兽医人员下乡检查牲畜防灾工作，进行爱护牲畜的宣传教育，向农民介绍防灾知识，并帮助不少农业社建立了牲畜饲养管理和使役制度。
    中国人民保险公司为了配合农业合作化运动，除了在东北各省继续办理牲畜保险外，准备今冬明春在河北、山西、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、江西、湖南、湖北、河南、广西、陕西十二省，以农业生产合作社为主要对象办理牲畜保险。
