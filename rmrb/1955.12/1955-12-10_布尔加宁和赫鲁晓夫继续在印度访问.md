He said that we know how bravely the people of Rajasthan are fighting against harsh natural conditions. We wish them to turn the arid areas of their state into lush fertile fields and gardens, into a source of people's well-being.

　　Bulganin pointed out that the friendship between the people of India and the Soviet Union is a significant and historically important victory. This friendship has arisen in the struggle of the peace-loving people of our two countries against war and for peace and security. The friendship between our two peoples is of great significance for further strengthening the forces of peace. He said that we advocate that the friendship and cooperation between India and the Soviet Union will grow and consolidate day by day, for the benefit of our two great countries and for the benefit of the cause of peace.
