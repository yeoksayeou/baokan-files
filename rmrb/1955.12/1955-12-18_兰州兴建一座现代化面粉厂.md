Lanzhou is building a modern flour processing plant - the Xinlan Flour Mill. This flour mill officially started construction on June 1st this year, and by November 30th, it had essentially completed the civil engineering construction of fourteen projects including the main factory building and auxiliary workshops. Currently, workers are installing machinery, and it is expected to be put into production in the second quarter of 1956.

With the rapid development of industrial construction, the population of Lanzhou has increased from more than 190,000 in 1949 to 510,000. The original flour mills in Lanzhou had outdated machinery and low production capacity, and could no longer meet the needs of the growing population. After this flour mill is officially put into production, the flour milling machines will all be powered by electricity, and it can produce 10,000 bags of flour per day, enough for 500,000 people to eat for one day.

    兰州兴建一座现代化面粉厂
    兰州市正在兴建一座现代化面粉加工厂——新兰面粉厂。这座面粉厂从今年六月一日正式开工兴建，到十一月三十日，已经基本完成了主要厂房和辅属车间等十四项工程的土木建筑。目前，工人们正在安装机器，预计在一九五六年第二季度即可投入生产。
    随着工业建设的迅速发展，兰州市人口从一九四九年到现在，已经由十九万多人增加到五十一万人。兰州市原有的面粉厂，机器设备陈旧，生产能力较低，已经不能满足人口日益增长的需要。这座面粉厂正式投入生产后，制粉机将全部由电力带动，每日可生产一万袋面粉，足够五十万人食用一天。
