    New Product Trial Production at Hangzhou General Machinery Factory
    By our reporter Fan Rongkang
    Over the past five years, the state-owned Hangzhou General Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced more than 100 new products, which are sold all over the country. They have made many non-standard equipment for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, supplied a large number of high-pressure air compressors, electric and hydraulic jacks and other lifting and transportation machinery, milk separators and other food industry machinery, and many other mechanical equipment to various departments. This year, the complete sets of refrigeration machinery successfully trial-produced by Hangzhou General Machinery Factory have also been shipped in large quantities. This kind of refrigeration machinery can make ice, refrigerate, and cool down, and has broad applications in the food industry, chemical industry, transportation industry, and civil construction. Currently, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory is trial-producing oxygen generators. After the successful trial production of this oxygen generator, it can provide a material guarantee for our country's steel industry to widely adopt the Soviet Union's advanced experience in oxygen steelmaking and increase steel production.
    By continuously expanding the production of new types of products, not only has the role of Hangzhou General Machinery Factory in developing the national economy been increasingly enhanced, but also the technological transformation of the enterprise has been promoted, and the enterprise's prospects have been opened up, so that this factory, which was just merged from several dilapidated small factories five years ago and could only engage in repair and assembly business and manufacture simple iron-wood mixed machines, has gradually developed into a mechanical factory with many mechanical equipment, a certain technical level, and the ability to manufacture independently.
    In order to improve the manufacturing level and fully utilize production capacity, China's machinery industry is developing towards specialization. The specialization direction of Hangzhou General Machinery Factory has also been generally determined. According to the direction of specialization, if we analyze the existing products of Hangzhou General Machinery Factory, the directional products only account for about 30% of the total number of varieties. That is to say, most of the products of Hangzhou General Machinery Factory will be handed over in the future. In addition, a large number of new professional direction products must be added, and gradually develop towards the direction of supplying complete sets of precision direction products. This is an extremely arduous and glorious task for Hangzhou General Machinery Factory under the new situation of accelerating the pace of industrial development. In order to meet this task, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory, under the supervision of the First Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the local Party committee, has conducted some inspections on the trial production of new products since the second half of this year, and proposed some measures to improve the trial production of new products, which is very necessary.
    Hangzhou General Machinery Factory believes that it is necessary to further improve the understanding of the trial production of new products, and regard the trial production of new products as an important measure to improve the technical level of China's machinery industry and accelerate socialist industrialization, instead of only considering the problem from the needs of the enterprise, so as to trial-produce and produce new types of products more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Hangzhou General Machinery Factory developed by manufacturing linen textile machinery for Zhejiang Linen Textile Factory. After the development, the linen textile machinery became unsalable, and the enterprise was often in a situation of insufficient tasks. When arranging the annual plan every year, there was a blank production task for more than a quarter, which needed to be supplemented by subsequent orders. This objective situation determines that Hangzhou General Machinery Factory must actively treat the trial production of new products. However, since Hangzhou General Machinery Factory often only considered this issue from the needs of the enterprise itself in the past, when the task was insufficient and eager to make up for it, the trial production of new products was often cancelled, the trial production procedures of new products were put aside, and regardless of whether the technical problems of the new products were resolved, they were eager to put them into mass production. In the second half of 1953, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory had insufficient tasks and put hydraulic jacks into mass production without seriously conducting sample trial production and small batch trial production. Many technical problems were concentrated in mass production, making the work passive. When the first batch of 1,500 hydraulic jacks were shipped to Shanghai for use, they either could not be lifted up or could not be lowered down after being lifted up, or they leaked oil, and all of them had to be returned for repair. At this time, it was discovered that there were more than 40 technical problems in the trial production of hydraulic jacks that had not been resolved, and almost every part had problems. Therefore, the material stress was recalculated, the material composition was tested, and the technical data was determined bit by bit before production was put on the right track, but the production cycle had been greatly delayed. In the fourth quarter of 1954, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory was not full again. At this time, a batch of tasks to trial-produce Soviet-style universal hoeing and cultivating machines came. In order to quickly fill the stomach, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory started trial production on the one hand, and could not wait to put them into mass production on the other hand. At that time, it was so hasty that whichever workshop had no task, the drawings of that part would be released first. When the forging workshop was idle, the design section rushed to draw the drawings of the hoe tooth handle, and when the casting workshop was idle, they rushed to draw the drawings of the control panel. The slogan of the design section was "Obey the needs of the factory and release the drawings quickly," and they were praised by the factory for rushing quickly. However, every part of every machine is interconnected, and the drawings of every part must be considered and reviewed from the whole. The drawings of the cultivator were released one by one, and there was no time to make such considerations and reviews, resulting in numerous errors. More than 400 pieces of the rack were processed, and it was found that there were errors in the drawings, and all of them were scrapped. Because the drawings of the hoe tooth handle were not reviewed according to the sub-assembly drawings, it was found that the size, shape, and perpendicularity were all problematic during assembly, and they had to be reprocessed and corrected.
    On the other hand, only organizing the trial production of new products from the needs of the enterprise itself, the production task is not a pressing matter, and the enthusiasm is small. Some staff members in the workshop compare the trial production of new products to gnawing bones, "It takes a lot of effort, but you don't get to eat a few bites of meat." This year, the plan to trial-produce milk separators at Hangzhou General Machinery Factory was delayed for two months. One important reason was that the forging workshop was busy rushing for other tasks and making up for the output value plan, and squeezed out the forging parts of the milk separator's tooling. Due to the influence of this view, in the work of the departments, as long as the factory director does not personally take charge and supervise day and night, the production technology preparation work will slack off. According to statistics from April to October this year, the average monthly production technology preparation plan of each department can only be completed by about 84%, and among them, the ones that are completed well are still the labor and wage departments and other departments with a small proportion of workload. Many important links in the production technology preparation have been repeatedly postponed.
    Hangzhou General Machinery Factory believes that due to the insufficient criticism of the local views of the enterprise in the past, new types of products cannot be trial-produced and produced more, faster, better, and more economically. First of all, the situation of overdue new product trial production plans is quite serious. This year, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory plans to complete the trial production of 25 new products. As of mid-November, 21 have been completed, many of which were completed overdue. Because new products cannot be put into mass production in time, or are barely put into mass production, but still cannot produce goods, it finally affects the completion of the output value plan. In February this year, it was planned to complete the trial production of two ammonia compressors, but in fact only one was completed in April, causing a deficit of 50,000 yuan in the total output value in February. In June this year, it was planned to produce 26 electric jacks with a lifting capacity of 25 tons, but because the trial production conclusion was not reached in time, they could not be put into production, reducing the total output value by more than 50,000 yuan, leaving more than 30% of the production capacity of the Third Machine Workshop idle.
    Secondly, the grasp of solving technical problems is not very high, and the scrap rate is relatively high. Some parts and components are trial-produced, and there is a lack of sufficient technical research in advance. They take it one step at a time, and if they are wrong, they start again, which actually becomes a simple experiment. Last year, in the trial production of nodular cast iron crankshafts for ammonia compressors, 18 castings were scrapped one after another, and finally it failed. This year, in the trial production of aluminum castings for the rotor of the blower, they did not seriously study it technically, and one furnace was bad, and another furnace came again. As a result, the scrap rate of the casting workshop reached 18% in October.
    Again, due to the frequent failure of the trial production plan, the inability to put it into production on schedule, and the high scrap rate, there is some waste in the trial production of new products. Last winter and this spring, the trial production of the cultivator at Hangzhou General Machinery Factory failed to succeed for a long time, and parts piled up like mountains in the workshop, but goods could not be produced. On the one hand, it affected the turnover of funds, and loans from banks were used to pay wages. On the other hand, it delayed orders and fined more than 30,000 yuan.
    In order to overcome local views, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory believes that it is necessary to overcome complacency. They feel that in the past, on the one hand, they did not have enough understanding of the complexity of the trial production of new products, and they did not know that any product, no matter how simple the structure, as long as it is a new product, there must be new technical problems for them that need to be seriously solved. When accepting the trial production task of five-ton hydraulic jacks, some workshop staff said: "Hydraulic jacks are not as big as thermos bottles, what's so difficult?" The leaders did not criticize it, and as a result, they suffered a setback. When accepting the trial production task of the cultivator, they said: "The cultivator has been made before, this time it is familiar," "Agricultural machinery, rough work," and as a result, they also suffered a setback. On the other hand, they feel that when accepting these lessons, they accepted more from the technical problems of processing and assembly, and less from the fundamental problems of the factory's leadership ideology and the understanding of the trial production of new products. Therefore, after the event, when certain technical problems of new products were solved, what the leaders saw was often only a "successful trial production of new products," "What could not be made in the past can now be made."
    Based on these understandings, Hangzhou General Machinery Factory is improving its work, the Party has repeatedly checked the complacency and arrogance, the administration has strengthened the production technology preparation work, and established a set of production technology preparation work system to meet the greater trial production of new products.

    杭州通用机器厂的新产品试制工作
    本报记者　范荣康
    国营杭州通用机器厂五年来试制成功了一百多种新产品，产品行销全国各地。他们为第一汽车制造厂制成了许多非标准设备，把大量高压空气压缩机、电动的和油压的千斤顶等起重运输机械、牛奶分离器等食品工业机械及其他许多机械设备供应了各个部门。今年，杭州通用机器厂试制成功的成套冷冻机械也已经大量出厂，这种冷冻机械可以制冰，可以冷藏，可以降温，在食品工业、化学工业、运输业和民用建筑中都有广阔的用途。现在，杭州通用机器厂正在试制制氧机，这种制氧机试制成功后，可以为我国钢铁工业广泛采用氧气炼钢的苏联先进经验，提高钢的产量提供物质上的保证。
    由于不断地扩大新种类产品的生产，不仅日益提高了杭州通用机器厂在发展国民经济中的作用，并且因此促进了企业的技术改造，开拓了企业的前途，使这个五年前刚由几个破烂的小厂合并起来的、只能经营修配业务和制造简单的铁木混合机器的工厂，逐渐发展成一个拥有很多机械设备，具有一定的技术水平，能够独立制造的机械工厂。
    为了提高制造水平，充分发挥生产能力，我国机械工业正朝专业化的方向发展。杭州通用机器厂的专业方向大体上也已经确定下来。根据专业化的方向来分析杭州通用机器厂现有的产品，那末，方向产品在品种总数中只占百分之三十左右。这就是说目前杭州通用机器厂的产品大部分在将来要交出去。另外要大量增加新的专业方向的产品，逐渐向供应成套精密的方向产品的方向发展。这是杭州通用机器厂在加快工业发展进度的新形势底下的一个极其繁重的、也是极其光荣的任务。为了迎接这个任务，杭州通用机器厂从今年下半年以来，在第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局和当地党委的督促下，对新产品试制工作作了一些检查，提出了一些改进新产品试制工作的措施，这是很必要的。
    杭州通用机器厂认为应该进一步提高对新产品试制工作的认识，把新产品试制工作看成是提高我国机械工业的技术水平、加速社会主义工业化的重要措施，而不是只从企业的需要来考虑问题，才能更多、更快、更好、更省地试制和生产新种类的产品。
    杭州通用机器厂是依靠为浙江麻纺织厂制造麻纺织机械而发展起来的，发展起来之后，麻纺织机械就滞销了，企业经常处在任务不足的情况下，每年安排年度计划的时候都有整整一个季度以上的生产任务是空白的，需要靠日后的订货来补充。这种客观情况决定了杭州通用机器厂必须积极对待新产品试制工作。但是，由于过去杭州通用机器厂往往只从企业本身的需要来考虑这个问题，当任务不足、急于弥补的时候，往往取消了新产品的试制工作，把新产品试制程序搁置在一旁，不管新产品的技术问题是不是都解决了，急于投入成批生产。一九五三年下半年，杭州通用机器厂任务不足，没有认真进行样品试制和小批试制就把油压千斤顶投入成批生产了。许多技术问题都集中到成批生产中来，使工作陷于被动。第一批出厂的一千五百台油压千斤顶运到上海使用的时候，不是顶不起来就是顶起来落不下去，再不然就是漏油，不得不全部退货返修。到这时候才发现油压千斤顶的试制中还有四十多个技术问题没有解决，几乎每一个零件都有毛病，于是重新着手计算材料应力，化验材料成份，一点一点地把技术资料定下来，生产才走上正轨，但是生产周期已经大大推迟了。一九五四年第四季度，杭州通用机器厂又吃不饱了。这时来了一批试制苏式万能锄草中耕机的任务。杭州通用机器厂为了迅速填肚子，就一面试制，一面迫不及待地投入成批生产。当时仓促到这样的程度：哪个车间没有任务就先出哪一部分图纸。锻工车间闲了，设计科就赶锄齿柄的图纸，铸工车间闲了，又赶操纵盘的图纸。设计科的口号是“服从厂的需要，赶快出图”，并且因为赶得快而受到厂里的表扬。可是，每一种机器的每一个零件都是相互联系的，每一个零件的图纸都必须从整体来考虑，来审核。中耕机的图纸是一张一张出去的，来不及作这样的考虑和审核，以致错误累累，齿条加工了四百多件，发现图纸有错，全部报废。锄齿柄的图纸因为没有按分装图来审核，到装配的时候发现尺寸、形状和垂直度都有问题，不得不重新加工纠正。
    另一方面，只从企业本身的需要来组织新产品试制工作，生产任务不足还不是燃眉之急，劲头就小了。有些车间里的工作人员把试制新产品譬喻为啃骨头，“费的劲不小，却没有吃上几口肉”。今年杭州通用机器厂试制牛奶分离器的计划脱期两个月，其中一个重要原因，就是锻工车间忙着赶别的任务，凑产值计划，而把牛奶分离器的工模具锻件挤掉了。由于这种观点的影响，在科室工作中，只要厂长不亲自抓、不日夜督促，生产技术准备工作就松懈下去。据今年四月至十月的统计，各个科室月度生产技术准备计划平均只能完成百分之八十四左右，而其中完成得好的，还是劳动工资科等工作量比例不大的科室。许多生产技术准备的重要环节都是再三推迟。
    杭州通用机器厂认为由于过去一个时期对企业的局部观点批判不够，不能更多、更快、更好、更省地试制和生产新种类的产品。首先是新产品试制计划脱期的情况相当严重，今年杭州通用机器厂计划完成二十五种新产品的试制工作，截至十一月中旬完成二十一种，其中很多都是脱期完成的。由于新产品不能及时投入成批生产，或勉强投入成批生产，但还是出不了商品，终于影响了产值计划的完成。今年二月计划完成两台氨压缩机的试制任务，实际上到四月才完成一台，使二月份的生产总值亏空五万元。今年六月计划出产二十六台举重二十五吨的电动千斤顶，但是因为没有及时得出试制结论，不能投入生产，减少生产总值五万多元，使第三机工车间百分之三十以上的生产能力闲下来。
    其次，技术问题的解决把握不大，废品率比较高。有些零件和原件的试制，事先缺乏充分的技术研究，边走边瞧，错了重来，实际上变成单纯的试验。去年为氨压缩机试制球墨铸铁曲轴，先后报废十八根铸件，最后还是失败。今年试制鼓风机上铝铸件的转子，没有从技术上认真研究，铸一炉坏一炉，坏一炉再来一炉，结果是十月份铸工车间的废品率达到百分之十八。
    再次，由于试制计划经常落空，不能按期投入生产和废品率高，新产品试制中有一些浪费。去冬今春，杭州通用机器厂试制中耕机迟迟不能成功，车间里零件堆积如山，却出不了商品，一方面影响资金周转，靠银行贷款发放工资，一方面耽误订货，罚款三万多元。
      为了克服局部观点，杭州通用机器厂认为必须克服自满情绪，他们觉得过去一方面对新产品试制工作的复杂性认识不足，不知道任何一种产品，不管构造多么简单，只要是新产品，就一定有对他们说来是新的技术问题，需要认真加以解决。接受五吨油压千斤顶试制任务的时候，有的车间工作人员说：“油压千斤顶还没热水瓶大，有什么难的？”领导上也没有加以批判，结果栽了跟斗。接受中耕机试制任务的时候，他们说：“中耕机早就造过，这回是驾轻就熟”、“农业机械，粗活”，结果也栽了跟斗。另一方面，他们觉得在接受这些教训的时候，从加工、装配等技术问题上来接受的多，从厂的领导思想，从对新产品试制工作的认识等根本问题上来接受的少。因而事过境迁，某些新产品的技术问题解决了，领导上所看到的往往只剩下一个“新产品试制成功”，“过去不会造的现在会造了”。
    根据这些认识，杭州通用机器厂正在改进自己的工作，党内一再检查了骄傲自满情绪，行政上加强了生产技术准备工作，建立了一套生产技术准备工作的制度，以迎接更大的新产品试制工作。
