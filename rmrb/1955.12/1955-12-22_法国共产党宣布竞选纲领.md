Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 21st (TASS) – "L'Humanité" published the French Communist Party's election platform on December 20th. The platform points out that the Communist Party believes it is necessary to increase wages, pensions, and allowances; eliminate regional wage differentials; increase paid leave; ensure equal pay for equal work for female workers, young workers, and North African workers; maintain the social insurance system; and expand housing construction.

    Regarding the laboring farmers, the Communist Party demands the abolition of high taxes on agricultural products and the provision of long-term loans to small farmers.

    The platform calls for increased spending on education and sports to enable young people to develop in an all-round way, and also calls for shortening the term of military service.

    The section of the platform on defending democracy includes the following: abolishing the state of emergency law, strictly observing republican legality, abolishing laws on subsidizing church schools, etc. The Communist Party calls for the implementation of proportional representation, the dissolution of the upper house of parliament—the Senate of the Republic, and granting the right to vote to all citizens over the age of eighteen.

    The Communist Party demands an end to the suppression of North African countries and negotiations with the plenipotentiary representatives of Algeria and Morocco.

    The final part of the platform, dealing with peace and international cooperation policy, states that France's foreign policy should be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and the settlement of all international disputes through negotiation. The Communist Party opposes the implementation of the Paris Accords on arming West Germany and advocates that France abolish this agreement. The platform calls on the French government to recognize the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, promote the establishment of a collective security system, advocate the prohibition of the production and use of atomic weapons, destroy existing atomic weapons, and use atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. The Communist Party calls for reducing military spending and armed forces, taking all measures to ease international tensions, expanding trade and cultural and scientific exchanges between France and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies, and exchanging travelers.
