    Do Not Forget the Rich Middle Peasants

    After seeing the poor and lower-middle peasants in their township joining cooperatives, and especially after hearing the sabotage rumors spread by bad elements, some rich middle peasants in Dayou Township, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, became very uneasy. Some rich middle peasants sighed all day long, saying, "My 'business' (referring to land and other property) was accumulated through diligence and thrift in the past." Some rich middle peasants, although unwilling to join the cooperative, went everywhere to find cadres and request to join. After discovering this situation, the township party branch mobilized propagandists to go door-to-door to conduct propaganda, set up "policy consultation offices" to answer various policy questions for rich middle peasants, and held various meetings such as township, village, piece, joint household, youth, and women's meetings to promote the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and expose the rumors of bad elements. After a series of propaganda efforts, the emotions of the rich middle peasants stabilized. Those who were preparing to cut down trees stopped cutting down trees, and those who wanted to do business stopped doing business. The production enthusiasm of the rich middle peasants was greatly improved. Feng Guosheng accumulated more than 10,000 catties of pond mud in a few days, and Wu Hongchuan also invested in buying cattle.

    The Dayou Township Party Branch did the right thing. While a township party branch should actively lead poor and lower-middle peasants to organize cooperatives, it should not neglect the leadership and assistance to rich middle peasants who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative. Only in this way can the rich middle peasants embark on the road of collectivization.

    不能忘记富裕中农
    广东省中山县大有乡的部分富裕中农在看到乡里的贫农和下中农参加合作社后，特别是听到坏分子的破坏谣言后，情绪就很不安定。有的富裕中农终日长嗟短叹道：“我的‘生意’（指田地等财产）都是过去勤俭积蓄起来的。”有的富裕中农虽然不愿入社，但到处找干部要求入社。这个乡的党支部发现这种情况后，就发动宣传员挨家挨户宣传，设立“政策问事处”，给富裕中农解答各种政策问题，召开乡、村、片、联家、青年、妇女等各种会议，宣传自愿互利政策，揭露坏分子的谣言。经过一系列的宣传以后，富裕中农的情绪就安定下来，准备砍树的不砍树了，想去做买卖的也不做买卖了。富裕中农的生产积极性大大提高，冯国胜几天就积了一万多斤塘泥，吴洪川也出资买牛。
    大有乡党支部做得很对，一个乡的党支部固然要积极地领导贫农和下中农组织合作社，但也不能忽视对暂时还不愿入社的富裕中农的领导和帮助。只有这样，富裕中农才能走上合作化的道路。
