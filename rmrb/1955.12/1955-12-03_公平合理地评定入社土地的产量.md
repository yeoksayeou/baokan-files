Currently, some new agricultural production cooperatives have not seriously assessed the yield of land entering the cooperative. According to an investigation by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, there is a general tendency throughout the province to underestimate the land yields of members. Similar situations have occurred in some areas of other provinces. Many new cooperatives assess land yields in a simple and crude way, resulting in unfair and unreasonable assessments, with some being too high and others too low. Some assess yields only based on soil quality, while others only assess yields based on actual production, failing to satisfy all members. Some cooperatives adopt an inappropriate approach to assessing land yields, failing to mobilize the broad masses of members and instead having a small number of people assess yields behind closed doors; as a result, members' concerns are not eliminated, opinions are divided, and no decision can be reached.

There are many reasons for these phenomena, one of the main reasons being that some staff members have overlooked the characteristics of the current agricultural collectivization movement in our country: general agricultural production cooperatives are still of a semi-socialist nature. Some staff members do not pay attention to this characteristic and blindly believe that since the masses' enthusiasm for joining the cooperative is high and land remuneration will be abolished sooner or later, why bother assessing land yields so carefully now, causing so much trouble? In fact, this kind of troublesome thing is very worthwhile to do. If land yield assessment is unreasonable, many members will be physically in the cooperative but mentally outside it, unable to unite and increase production.

How can land yields be assessed reasonably? The most important thing is to pay attention to mastering and publicizing the relevant specific policies. Facts have universally proven that the provisions of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the draft model charter of agricultural production cooperatives regarding the method of assessing the yield of land entering the cooperative are completely correct: it is necessary to base the assessment on the quality of the land and also on the normal annual actual yield of the land, and neither aspect can be neglected. The three new cooperatives established under the leadership of the Xinxu Township Branch in Deqing County, Guangdong, initially instructed that "land yield assessment should not be too high and should be based on the natural conditions of the land"; as a result, middle peasant members had many opinions and no result could be reached. Then, the branch instructed that "all assessments should be based on the normal annual actual yield"; as a result, poor peasant members firmly opposed it. After hitting two snags, the branch held a meeting to review and found that the problem was that they had not properly studied the specific policies for assessing the means of production. The branch committee led Party members and preparatory committee members to study the policies, and then thoroughly publicized the policies to all members; they also formulated a land yield assessment plan and submitted it to the members for discussion and revision, finally achieving everyone's satisfaction.

To make the land yield assessment reasonable, it is necessary to rely on the poor peasants and firmly unite with the middle peasants; special attention should be paid to educating the backbone members and poor peasant members on firmly uniting with the middle peasants. According to investigations in various places, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants generally account for about 80% of the members of the new cooperatives; the vast majority of leading backbone members of the new cooperatives are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. This is certainly a good phenomenon. The backbone members of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are generally more fair in handling various specific issues within the cooperative. However, because some areas have neglected to educate the backbone members and poor peasant members on firmly uniting with the middle peasants, they will naturally, for their own temporary interests, fail to pay attention to the normal annual actual yield of the middle peasants' land. A poor peasant backbone member in Shuangqiao Township, Wuming, Guangxi, said: "If the assessment takes into account the normal annual actual yield, how can we with little land and few fields achieve common prosperity in the future?" They should be made to fully understand that this is an incorrect understanding of "common prosperity." Doing so is not conducive to the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, and ultimately, it is not beneficial to the poor peasants either.

To do a good job in assessing the yield of land entering the cooperative, it is necessary to master the correct working method of the mass line. Some staff members only act on the subjective wishes of a few people, instead of relying on the masses; they isolate the assessment as a purely technical work, without closely combining it with political work. In some townships in Lianjiang County, Guangdong, the preparatory committee for the establishment of the cooperative simply calculated the yield of each household's land contributed as shares based on the roster of public grain collection, convened a members' meeting to announce it, or notified the members household by household, and that was it. In some new cooperatives in Rong County, Guangxi, the yield of land entering the cooperative was even uniformly assessed by discounting the grain "three fix" quota by 10%. Such "assessments" are, of course, inevitably somewhat unreasonable.

To do a good job in assessing the yield of land entering the cooperative, one should correctly understand the relationship between the grain "three fix" quota and the assessment of land entering the cooperative. According to the "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas," the quota is calculated based on the normal annual yield per unit area of grain fields attributed to each household; for grain fields with normal harvests in 1955, the normal annual yield per unit area should be assessed based on the actual yield. In order to make the figures for unified purchase and sale realistic, the assessment of land yields for farmers with poor management conditions should be slightly lower than the yield of land with the same natural conditions. In order to encourage increased production, generally speaking, the quota for land that originally had the same natural conditions but had a particularly high actual yield due to better management should also be slightly lower than the actual yield. This is not exactly the same as the standard for assessing land entering the cooperative. For land of the same quality entering the cooperative but with lower yields due to poor management conditions, the assessed yield should be slightly higher than the actual yield in order to take care of the legitimate interests of the land owners. For land with particularly high actual yields due to improved soil, added water conservancy facilities, etc., the assessed yield should also be slightly higher than the yield of land of the same quality. Of course, different specific situations should be distinguished here. If it is only because of the application of quick-acting fertilizers that a relatively high actual yield is obtained, and when the fertilizer has been exhausted and the land owner has already received the investment benefits, the assessment should not be higher than that of land of the same quality. If the fertility has not been exhausted but the soil quality cannot be fundamentally improved, the yield of this land should not be assessed particularly high either, but should be compensated in other ways. If the soil has been improved, water conservancy facilities have been built, the original sloping land has been terraced, or the original uneven land has been leveled, the yield must be appropriately increased. In short, the grain "three fix" quota and the assessment of land entering the cooperative should be distinguished, and simply discounting or adding a few percent to one as the other will inevitably be unreasonable. However, in order to make both realistic and avoid false reporting, it is very necessary for the two to be combined and cross-referenced. If either one was assessed first and an unreasonable phenomenon occurred due to false reporting, it should be allowed to be corrected.

To make the yield assessment of land entering the cooperative reasonable, we should also pay attention to correcting another incorrect view of some cooperative staff members and backbone members in the cooperative. In order to make the total output of the cooperative easy to exceed the assessed output and "show the superiority of the cooperative", they deliberately lowered the output. This situation was found in Suichuan County, Jiangxi and Wuming County, Guangxi. This kind of thinking and practice is of course unacceptable. This is just deceiving oneself and will not be of any benefit to the socialist cause, but will instead create many difficulties for the cooperative in formulating production plans and implementing year-round contracting.

According to estimates in various places, among the newly established cooperatives, those with relatively sound aspects account for 50% to 70%, those that are average account for 30% to 40%, and those with more problems left over from the establishment of the cooperative account for 10%. In cooperatives with relatively sound aspects in all aspects, the assessment of means of production is generally well done. The phenomenon of unreasonable land yield assessment mainly occurs in a small number of cooperatives with more problems left over from the establishment of the cooperative and in some average cooperatives. However, this does not mean that we do not need to pay close attention to this situation. Unreasonable land yield assessment will inevitably have very bad effects. In Meilian Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, a new cooperative generally assessed the yield of land too low; on the second day after the land yield assessment, four of the eight members who had assessed the land yield and had more land and less labor proposed to withdraw from the cooperative; sixteen households in the township withdrew from the cooperative because the land yield assessment was too low. After discovering this situation, the township branch led various new cooperatives to mobilize members to fully discuss and reassess reasonable yields, and these households rejoined the cooperative. This situation shows that the shortcomings and deviations that occur in the movement must be overcome and corrected in a timely manner, and it is not difficult to overcome and correct them. The only question is whether the Party committee and branch pay attention to grasping policies, strengthening specific leadership; whether they conduct timely inspections and provide timely assistance; and whether they go deep into the masses and rely on the masses.

### 公平合理地评定入社土地的产量

    公平合理地评定入社土地的产量
    目前，一部分新的农业生产合作社没有认真地评议入社土地的产量。据广东省委调查，全省各地农业生产合作社对于社员的土地产量的评定，有普遍压低的倾向。在别的省份的一些地区，也发生了类似的情形。有许多新社用简单粗糙的方式评定土地产量，结果就不能公平合理，有的偏高，有的偏低。有的只按土质评产，有的只按实产量评产，都不能使全体社员满意。有些合作社评议土地产量采用一种不妥当的做法，不发动广大社员群众，而由少数人关起门来评定；结果因为社员群众的顾虑没有消除，意见纷纭，不能定案。
    发生这些现象的原因很多，主要原因之一是一些工作人员忽视了目前我国农业合作化运动的特点：一般的农业生产合作社还是半社会主义性质的。有些工作人员不注意这个特点，而盲目地认为：既然群众入社情绪很高，而且早晚要取消土地报酬，现时对土地评产何必那末认真评长评短，多找麻烦呢？其实，这种麻烦事情很值得做。土地评产不合理，许多社员就将身在社里心在社外，不能团结一致增加生产。
    怎样才能把土地产量评定得合理？最重要的是要注意掌握和宣传有关的具体政策。事实已经普遍地证明了，中共七届六中全会的决议和农业生产合作社示范章程草案中关于入社土地产量评定办法的规定是完全正确的：要根据土地的质量，同时要根据土地的常年实际产量，两方面都不可偏废。广东德庆县新墟乡支部领导建立的三个新社，最初布置“土地评产不应评得太高，应该按土地的自然条件评定入社产量”；结果，中农社员意见很多，评不出结果来。于是，支部又布置“都按常年实产量评定”；结果，贫农社员坚决反对。碰了两次钉子以后，支部开会检查，才发现毛病就在于没有好好学习评议生产资料的具体政策。支委领导党员和建社筹备委员学习了政策，然后又向全体社员深入地宣传了政策；并且制定土地评产方案，又交给社员讨论修正，终于做到了大家满意。
    要把入社土地产量评得合理，必须依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农；特别应该注意对办社骨干分子和贫农社员进行巩固地团结中农的教育。据各地调查，在新社的社员当中，贫农和下中农一般占百分之八十左右；新社绝大部分的领导骨干是贫农和下中农。这当然是很好的现象。贫农和下中农的骨干分子，一般地说在处理社内各种具体问题的时候是比较公道的。可是，由于部分地区忽视了对贫农骨干分子和贫农社员进行巩固地团结中农的教育，他们很自然地会为了自己一时的利益而不注意照顾中农土地的常年实际产量。广西武鸣双桥乡的一个贫农骨干说：“如果评产要照顾常年实产量，我们田少地少，将来怎能共同富裕呢？”应当使他们充分了解：这是对于“共同富裕”的不正确的理解。照这样做，不利于农业生产合作社的发展和巩固，归根到底，对贫农也很不利。
    要把入社土地评产工作做好，必须掌握正确的群众路线的工作方法。有些工作人员只是凭少数人的主观愿望办事，而不是依靠群众办事；他们把评产这件事孤立起来当作一件纯技术性的工作来做，而没有把它同政治工作紧密地结合起来。广东廉江县有一些乡，只是由建社筹备委员会根据征收公粮的清册把各户入股土地的产量计算出来，召开社员大会宣布或者向社员逐户通知，就算了事。广西容县有的新社甚至一律按粮食“三定”到户的定产产量打九折作为入社土地产量。这样“评产”，当然难免有些不合理。
    要把入社土地评产工作做好，应该正确地了解粮食“三定”的定产同入社土地的评产的关系。按照农村粮食统购统销暂行办法的规定，定产是按粮田单位面积常年产量归户计算的；凡一九五五年收成正常的粮田，应该按实际产量评定单位面积常年产量。为了使统购统销的数字切合实际，对于经营条件较差农户的土地评产，应该按照同等自然条件的土地产量稍为减低一些。为了鼓励增产，一般地说，原来自然条件相同但因为经营较好而实产量特别高的土地，定产也稍低于实产量。这和入社土地的评产标准不完全相同。对于入社土地质量相同但因为经营条件不好而产量较低的，为了照顾这一部分土地所有者应有的利益，评定的产量应当比实产量略高。对于因为改良了土壤、增添了水利设施等而实际产量特别高的，评定的产量也应当比同等质量的土地的产量稍高。这里，当然应该区别各种不同的具体情况。如果只是因为增施速效肥料而得到比较高的实际产量的，当着肥力已经用尽，土地所有者已经得到了投资利益以后，就不应比同等质量的土地评产高。如果肥力还没有用尽但并不能根本改良土质，这种土地产量也不应该特别评高，而应当用别的办法给以补偿。如果是改良了土壤、修了水利、把原来的坡地修成了梯田、把原来不平的修成了平地，就必须把产量适当提高。总之，粮食“三定”的定产和入社土地的评产应当有所区别，按照其中的一种简单地一律打折扣或一律加几成作为另一种产量，必然会不合理。但是，为了使两者都切合实际，避免虚报，两者互相结合、互相参照，却很必要。如果其中哪一个是先评的，因为虚报而产生了不合理的现象，也应该允许改正。
    要把入社土地的产量评得合理，还要注意纠正一部分办社工作人员和社内骨干分子的另一种不正确的看法。他们为了使合作社的总产量容易超出评议的产量，“显示合作社的优越性”，就故意把产量压低。在江西遂川县、广西武鸣县都发现了这种情形。这种想法和做法当然要不得。这只不过是自己骗自己，对于社会主义事业不会有一点好处，反而会给合作社制定生产计划、实行常年包工招来很多困难。
    据各地估计，最近建立的新社，各方面比较健全的社约占百分之五十到七十，中等的社约占百分之三十到四十，建社中的遗留问题比较多的社约占百分之十。在各方面比较健全的社里，生产资料的评议工作一般是做好了的。土地评产不合理的现象，主要是发生在为数不多的建社中的遗留问题比较多的社和一部分中等的社。但是，这决不是说，对这个情况就不必密切地加以注意。土地评产不合理，必然要发生很不好的影响。广东省揭阳县梅联乡有一个新社把土地的产量普遍评得偏低；评产的第二天，已评过土地产量的八户社员中，就有四户土地较多劳力较少的社员提出要退社；全乡有十六户因为土地评产偏低退出了合作社。乡支部发现了这种情况以后，领导各个新社发动社员充分讨论，重新评定了合理的产量，这些户就都又参加了合作社。这种情况说明：在运动当中发生的缺点和偏向，必须及时克服和纠正，也不难克服和纠正，问题只在于党委和支部是不是注意掌握政策，加强具体领导；是不是及时检查，及时帮助；是不是深入群众，依靠群众。
