    Advanced Experience and Advanced Producer
    Material Worker Chu Yunde Saves Steel
    Lǚ Dài
    Although Chu Yunde, a material worker at Dalian Shipbuilding Company's hull workshop, is only a third-level technician, he has saved more than fifteen tons of steel for the country in the past two years due to his highly conscious spirit of thrift in his work, and has not had any quality accidents.
    Material work is the first process in hull workshop production, and the quality of the material work has a great impact on saving steel and ensuring quality. In order to control this process and avoid waste of steel, Chu Yunde always asks the section chief and group leader about the content and requirements of the work before material processing, and then carefully studies the drawings; he is careful in his calculations when processing materials, and never uses large materials for work that can be done with small materials; he never uses new materials for work that can be done with old materials. For example, once he had to process the insurance ship cover on the ship. The raw material ticket stipulated that six whole pieces of new steel plate were required. After studying the style of the insurance ship cover, he believed that it could be replaced by welding steel strips left over from the past. The leadership agreed with his approach. As a result, because it was troublesome to process small pieces of material, he completed slightly less than the quota and his income was also less, but he was very happy because he saved six new steel plates for the country, worth nearly 4,000 yuan.
    Chu Yunde believes: "Material work is like tailoring clothes. It is a waste to take enough material to make clothes and use it to mend socks." Therefore, he pays great attention to studying scientific cutting methods. Once, he received a batch of triangular board work for the large mast bucket. According to the general material processing method, the pieces are processed side by side on a steel plate. In this way, only three triangular boards can be processed on one steel plate, leaving a lot of irregular waste. He felt that this was too wasteful, so he repeatedly drew sketches on the ground with a stone pencil, not even hearing the dinner bell, and finally developed a "positive and negative reversal" cutting method. In this way, six triangular boards can be processed on the same steel plate, twice as many as before.
    Chu Yunde knows that compared with the cause of socialist construction, the achievements of individual thrift are only "a drop in the ocean." To build socialism, everyone must work together to turn countless drops of water into the ocean. Therefore, he not only pays attention to saving himself, but also often helps others to save. If he sees someone wasting, he immediately raises his opinion and tells the other party his experience. One day in the spring of this year, he came down from the ship and saw two workers from another group guarding two crooked old iron plates, worried about not being able to find the position of the template eye. Chu Yunde went over and studied with them for more than two hours, and finally found the position of the template eye. The two workers thanked him and said: "If it weren't for your help, not only would the large material process have to stop and wait for materials, but these iron plates would have become waste products." Another time, worker Li Weixun was processing the ship's wall panels of a certain ship. The shape of the panel was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, and the width of the top was three meters and one hundred and fifty millimeters, but Li Weixun processed two pieces side by side on a six-meter-long steel plate, and the upper corner of one piece was short by three hundred millimeters. When Chu Yunde saw it, he asked Li Weixun to use the "reverse and upside down" material processing method. As a result, four complete ship wall panels were processed on the same steel plate.
    Recently, Chu Yunde has put forward a proposal to all employees of the company to save every inch of steel, which has been valued and responded to by the majority of employees. Everyone has expressed that they will actively learn from Chu Yunde.

    先进经验和先进生产者
    号料工人初允德节约钢材
    吕岱
    大连造船公司船体车间号料工人初允德虽然只有三级技术，但是，由于在工作中发挥了高度的自觉的节约精神，两年来共为国家节约了十五吨多钢材，并且没有出过任何质量事故。
    号料是船体车间生产的第一道工序，号料工作做得好坏，对节约钢材、保证质量有很大关系。为了把住这一道关口，避免钢材的浪费，初允德号料前，总是先向工段长和小组长问清楚活的内容和要求，然后再仔细研究图纸；号料时做到精打细算，能用小材料的活决不用大材料；能用旧材料的活，决不用新材料。如有一次号船上的保险舰盖，原材料票上规定需要六整块新钢板，他研究了保险舰盖的式样以后，认为可以用过去剩下来的钢板条焊接起来代替，领导上同意他的做法。结果，由于号小块料费事，他完成的定额稍为少了一些，收入也少了一些，但是，他非常高兴，因为他给国家节省了六张新钢板，价值将近四千元。
    初允德认为：“号料像裁衣服一样，把够做衣服的料子拿去补袜子就是浪费。”因此，他非常注意研究科学的剪裁方法。有一次，他接到一批号大桅斗子的三角板活。按一般号料的操作方法，是在一张钢板上并排着号。这样，一张钢板就只能号三块三角板，剩下了许多不方不正的废料。他觉得这样太浪费了，就用石笔在地上反复画着草图，连吃饭的铃声都没有听见，终于研究出一种“反正颠倒”的剪裁方法。这样，用同样一张钢板就能号出六块三角板，比过去多了一倍。
    初允德知道，个人的节约成果跟社会主义建设事业比较起来，只不过是“沧海之一粟”罢了，要建设社会主义，必须大家动手，才能把无数的水滴变成沧海。所以，他不但自己注意节约，还经常帮助别人节约，看见别人有浪费，便立即提出意见，并把自己的经验告诉对方。今年春季的一天，他从船上走下来，看见别组的两个工人正在守着曲曲弯弯的两张旧铁板发愁，苦于找不到样板眼的位置。初允德就过去和他们研究了两个多钟头，终于把样板眼的位置找出来了。这两个工人感谢他说：“要不是你帮助，不仅大料工序要停工待料，这几张铁板也将成了废品。”还有一次，工人李维训号某船的船壁板，板的形状是上宽下窄，上面的宽径是三公尺一百五十公厘，可是李维训在一张六公尺长的钢板上并排地号了两块，还有一块的上角要差三百公厘。初允德看见了，就让李维训用“翻转颠倒”的号料法，结果在一张同样钢板上多号出了四块完整无缺的船壁板来。
    最近，初允德已向全公司职工提出了节约每寸钢材的倡议，得到了广大职工群众的重视和响应，大家纷纷表示：要积极向初允德学习。
