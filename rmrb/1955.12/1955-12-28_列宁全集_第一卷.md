    "Collected Works of Lenin," Volume 1
    He Kuang
    The Chinese version of "Collected Works of Lenin" is translated by the Compilation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China according to the Russian fourth edition of "Collected Works of Lenin," as decided by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Russian fourth edition of "Collected Works of Lenin" has a total of thirty-five volumes, and the Chinese version of each volume will be published successively in the coming years, starting in 1955.
    The works in the first volume of "Collected Works of Lenin" were written between 1893 and 1894, and there are four in total: "New Economic Developments in Peasant Life," "On the So-Called Market Question," "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats," and "The Economic Content of Narodism and Its Criticism in Mr. Struve’s Book." From the works in this first volume, we can see that Lenin, at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four, had already read, studied, and profoundly mastered the main works of Marx and Engels, and was good at using the working-class standpoint, the materialist viewpoint, and the dialectical method to analyze the reality of Russia and point out the road for the development of the Russian revolution. He had already used scientific criticism to thoroughly shatter the liberal Narodism and legal Marxism, which were harmful to the Russian revolutionary cause, in terms of thought.
    The theoretical work that Lenin engaged in during the initial period of revolutionary activity was mainly to use Marxist theory, based on rich practical materials, to scientifically analyze the reality of Russia, the path of Russia's economic development, and the various classes of Russian society. Correctly identifying the essence of Russia's socio-economic system and its laws of development was a fundamental problem that urgently needed to be solved in the Russian revolutionary movement at that time. The correct solution to this problem was the primary and decisive condition for correctly leading the revolution. Since the abolition of the serf system in 1861, this issue "became the main theoretical problem in the minds of Russian socialists, the most heated debates were concentrated on this issue, and the solution of the most important programmatic principles hinged on this issue." (Page 245) At that time, the Narodniks, who hindered the spread of Marxist theory in Russia, hindered the working class from understanding its historical mission, and hindered the establishment of a Russian working-class party, were precisely on this central issue, widely spreading subjective idealist views, the so-called unique theory of Russian development. Without fighting against the Narodniks and without shattering the Narodniks, the Russian revolutionary movement could not develop along the correct path; and without making an objective, comprehensive, profound, and scientific analysis of the socio-economic system in Russia at that time, it would be impossible to thoroughly shatter the fallacies of the Narodniks in terms of thought. Lenin's initial theoretical work precisely completed this great historical task that determined the fate of the Russian revolution. The subsequent socio-economic development of Russia and the entire Russian revolutionary process fully proved the correctness of Lenin's revolutionary theory.
    Lenin used the iron facts in Russia's economic situation, and the scientific analysis of these facts, to clarify the emergence and development of capitalism in Russia, and thoroughly shattered the fallacies of the Narodniks. In articles such as "New Economic Developments in Peasant Life" and "On the So-Called Market Question," Lenin studied the statistical materials of the peasant economy in several counties in southern Russia, proving that the peasants within and outside the village community had not only quantitative differences, differences in wealth, but also qualitative differences, differences in the nature of management. After analyzing the conditions of various types of peasants in detail, he concluded that the peasants were not a unified whole, but were differentiating into two poles, differentiating into the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Lenin used the statistical materials of several industries in several counties to analyze the conditions of handicrafts (that is, the so-called "people's" production of the Narodniks), proving that in industries such as brick-making and knife-making, what prevailed was large-scale family production. This large-scale family production was capitalist production relations, and the relationship of capital exploiting labor. At the same time, Lenin, starting from Marx's theory of social reproduction, based on facts and statistics, proved that the development of capitalism itself created a domestic market, and the differentiation of peasants was not a shrinking market, but an expanding market. The so-called theory of lacking a domestic market was completely a fabrication of the Narodniks. Based on all the above analysis, Lenin pointed out that the dominant economic system in Russia at that time was the capitalist system, and the development of capitalism was an inherent and inevitable trend in Russia's economic development.
    Based on the scientific understanding of the road of Russia's economic development, Lenin correctly pointed out the road of the Russian revolution and formulated the programmatic principles of the Russian revolution. He pointed out that the most advanced class in Russian society was the working class, which was the only and natural representative of all the exploited working masses in Russia. The task of Marxists was to promote the development of the Russian workers' movement, to transform it from the current state of attempting to carry out scattered and leaderless protests, "riots," and strikes, into an organized struggle of the entire Russian working class to overthrow the bourgeois system and expropriate the expropriators. Lenin put forward the idea of the leadership of the working class, the idea of a worker-peasant alliance, and the idea of transforming the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution; he predicted with genius: "When the advanced representatives of the working class understand the ideas of scientific socialism, understand the ideas about the historical mission of the Russian workers, when these ideas are widely disseminated and create among the workers a solid organization that transforms their current dispersed economic warfare into a conscious class struggle, the Russian workers will be able to lead all democrats to overthrow the autocratic system, and guide the Russian proletariat (alongside the proletariats of all countries) along the road of open political struggle towards the victorious communist revolution." (Pages 277-278)
    Narodism is a petty-bourgeois idealist ideological system that is hostile to Marxism. The Narodniks of the 1890s, that is, the liberal Narodniks, became the main ideological enemies of Marxism. They claimed that their theories, programs, and tactics were socialist, and called themselves "Friends of the People."
    The liberal Narodniks, headed by Mikhailovsky and others, launched a vicious attack on Marxism in the "Russian Wealth" magazine (the organ of the liberal Narodniks). They attacked Marxism with various methods of distortion, fabrication, and reversal of right and wrong. In his famous work "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats," Lenin defended and developed the theoretical foundation of Marxism—dialectical materialism and historical materialism—and thoroughly shattered the subjective idealist world view of the Narodniks.
    Lenin made profound expositions and analyses of Marxism, proving that Marx's great achievement lay in his abandoning discussions about what society in general is, formulating the concept of socio-economic formation, determining that the socio-economic base is the sum total of certain production relations, and determining that the development of socio-economic formations is a natural historical process that does not depend on people's consciousness or will, thereby creating a materialist view of history and turning sociology into a science. Lenin pointed out that after Marx specifically analyzed the capitalist economic formation and discovered the laws of the emergence, development, and demise of capitalism, after the publication of "Capital," the hypothesis of the materialist view of history had been scientifically demonstrated.
    While defending the theoretical foundation of Marxism, Lenin, through profound analysis and argumentation, pointed out that there was nothing socialist in the theoretical program and tactics of the Narodniks. The liberal Narodniks were representatives of the interests of the rich peasants.
    Lenin summarized the criticism of the liberal Narodniks by saying that the Narodniks, posing as "Friends of the People," were actually the deadly enemies of the people and the deadly enemies of the Social Democrats. In the article "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats?", Lenin defined the basic task of Russian Marxists, namely, to form a unified socialist workers' party. Lenin brilliantly pointed out the path of the working class's struggle, recognizing that the working class was the advanced revolutionary force in society, and recognizing that the peasants were the allies of the working class.
    In the struggle against the Narodniks, Lenin also unreservedly exposed the liberal bourgeois essence of the "Legal Marxists" represented by Struve. These "Legal Marxists" attempted to take advantage of the working-class party's lack of Marxist cultivation, lack of ideological unity, and lack of practical training, to disguise themselves as Marxists, to castrate the revolutionary content of Marxism, to turn Marxism into reformism, and to make the workers' movement subordinate to the interests of the bourgeoisie.
    The "Legal Marxists" also opposed the Narodniks, but they criticized Narodism not from a Marxist standpoint, but from a bourgeois liberal standpoint. Struve tried his best to avoid the class contradictions inherent in capitalism, limiting his task to proving the inevitability and progressiveness of the existence of capitalism. Lenin, in exposing Struve's one-sidedness, pointed out that the basis of his methodology was bourgeois objectivism. Lenin said that there was a difference between materialism and objectivism. "Objectivists talk about the inevitability of the existing historical process; materialists, on the other hand, accurately affirm the existing socio-economic formation and the antagonistic relations it produces. When objectivists prove the inevitability of an existing series of facts, they always unconsciously stand on the position of defending these facts; materialists, on the other hand, expose class contradictions, thereby determining their own position." "Materialism itself contains the so-called party spirit, requiring that in making any assessment of events, one must frankly and openly stand on the position of a certain social group." (Pages 378-379).
    At the same time, when examining Struve's views on a fundamental issue of Marxism, namely the issue of the state, Lenin exposed the bourgeois essence of the "Legal Marxists." Lenin pointed out that they wanted to regard the bourgeois state, the tool of class rule by the bourgeoisie, as a supra-class organization, in essence, to make the bourgeois state exist forever.
    Lenin's work "The Economic Content of Narodism and Its Criticism in Mr. Struve's Book" not only exposed the bourgeois essence of the Russian "Legal Marxists," but also had great significance for opposing the opportunism and revisionism of the right-wing social democrats.
    The works in the first volume of "Collected Works of Lenin," especially "What the 'Friends of the People' Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats?", are extremely important works in Marxist-Leninist literature. Lenin's elucidation and development of the theory of historical materialism, and his criticism of subjective idealism and bourgeois objectivism in these works, still have great practical significance today. We must learn from the works in the first volume of "Collected Works of Lenin" how to use the materialist method to scientifically analyze and solve new problems in the socio-economic development of our country's reality, how to wage an uncompromising struggle against the idealism manifested in various scientific fields and practical work, and how to have a high degree of class character and party spirit in observing and analyzing each problem, in order to promote China's socialist construction.

    “列宁全集”第一卷
    何匡
    “列宁全集”中文版是根据中国共产党中央委员会决定，由中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局依照“列宁全集”俄文第四版译出的。“列宁全集”俄文第四版共三十五卷，各卷的中文本从一九五五年开始在今后数年内陆续出版。
    “列宁全集”第一卷的著作，写于一八九三至一八九四年，共有四篇：“农民生活中新的经济变动”，“论所谓市场问题”，“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”，“民粹主义的经济内容及其在司徒卢威先生的书中受到的批评”。从这第一卷的著作中，我们可以看到，列宁还在二十三四岁的时候，就已阅读、研究和深刻地掌握了马克思和恩格斯的主要著作，就已善于用工人阶级立场、唯物主义观点和辩证方法，来分析俄国的现实和指出俄国革命发展的道路，就已用科学的批判从思想上彻底粉碎了危害俄国革命事业的自由民粹主义和合法马克思主义。
    列宁在革命活动初期所从事的理论工作，主要是用马克思主义理论，根据丰富的实际材料，科学地分析俄国的现实、俄国的经济发展道路，以及俄国社会的各个阶级。正确地判明俄国的社会经济制度的实质及其发展规律，是当时俄国革命运动中迫切需要解决的根本问题。这个问题的正确解决，是正确领导革命的首要的和决定的条件。自一八六一年农奴制度废除后，这个问题“成了俄国社会主义者心目中的主要理论问题，最热烈的争论都集中在这个问题上，最重要的纲领性原理的解决都以这个问题为转移。”（二四五页）当时阻碍马克思主义理论在俄国的传播、阻碍工人阶级了解自己的历史使命、阻碍俄国工人阶级政党的建立的民粹派，正是在这个中心问题上，广泛地散布着主观唯心主义的观点，即所谓俄国发展的独特论。不同民粹派作斗争，不粉碎民粹派，俄国革命运动便不能沿着正确的道路发展起来；而不对俄国当时的社会经济制度作客观、全面、深刻而科学的分析，要从思想上彻底粉碎民粹派的谬论也是不可能的。列宁初期的理论工作正是完成了这一决定俄国革命命运的伟大历史任务。以后俄国社会经济的发展和整个俄国革命进程，完全证明了列宁的革命理论的正确性。
    列宁用俄国经济状况中的铁的事实，用对这些事实所作的科学分析，阐明了俄国资本主义的发生及其发展，彻底粉碎了民粹派的谬论。列宁在“农民生活中新的经济变动”和“论所谓市场问题”等文章中研究了南俄几个县的农民经济统计材料，证明村社内和村社外的农民，不仅有量的差别，富裕程度上的差别，而且有质的差别，经营性质上的差别。他在详细地分析了各类农民的状况后，得出结论说，农民不是统一的整体，而是在向两极分化，分化为资产阶级和无产阶级。列宁用了几个县的几个行业的统计材料，分析了手工业（即民粹派的所谓“人民”生产）的状况，证明在烧砖业、制刀业等等手工业中，占优势的是家庭制大生产。这种家庭制大生产就是资本主义生产关系，就是资本剥削劳动的关系。同时列宁以马克思的社会再生产理论为出发点，根据事实和统计数字，证明资本主义的发展本身就造成国内市场，农民的分化不是市场缩小，而是市场扩大，所谓缺乏国内市场的理论，完全是民粹派的虚构。列宁根据上述一切分析，指出俄国当时占统治地位的经济制度是资本主义制度，资本主义的发展是俄国经济发展的内在的必然的趋势。
    列宁依据对俄国经济发展道路的科学认识，正确地指出了俄国革命的道路，制定了俄国革命的纲领性原理。他指出俄国社会中最先进的阶级是工人阶级，它是俄国全体被剥削的劳动群众的唯一的和天然的代表。马克思主义者的任务，是促进俄国工人运动的发展，使它脱离当前那种试图进行分散而缺乏领导思想的抗议、“骚动”和罢工的状态，而转变为整个俄国工人阶级的有组织的斗争，以推翻资产阶级制度，剥夺剥夺者。列宁提出了工人阶级领导权的思想、工农联盟的思想，以及由民主革命转变为社会主义革命的思想；他天才地预见到：“当工人阶级的先进代表领会了科学社会主义思想，领会了关于俄国工人的历史使命的思想时，当这些思想得到广泛的传播并在工人中造成一种把他们现时分散的经济战变为自觉的阶级斗争的坚固组织时，俄国工人就能率领一切民主分子去推翻专制制度，并引导俄国无产阶级（和世界各国无产阶级并排地）循着公开政治斗争的大道走向胜利的共产主义革命。”（二七七—二七八页）
    民粹主义是一种敌视马克思主义的小资产阶级的唯心主义思想体系。十九世纪九十年代的民粹派，即自由主义民粹派，成了马克思主义的主要思想敌人。他们把自己的理论、纲领和策略说成是社会主义的，把自己说成是“人民之友”。
    以米海洛夫斯基等为首的自由主义民粹派，在“俄国财富”杂志（自由主义民粹派的机关刊物）上展开了对马克思主义的恶毒攻击，他们用种种歪曲、捏造和颠倒是非的办法来攻击马克思主义。列宁在他的名著“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”中保卫和发展了马克思主义的理论基础——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，彻底粉碎了民粹派的主观唯心主义世界观。
    列宁对马克思主义作了精深的阐述和分析，证明马克思的伟大功绩在于他摒弃了关于一般社会是什么的议论，制定了社会经济形态这一概念，确定了社会经济基础是一定生产关系的总和，确定了社会经济形态的发展是不以人们的意识或意志为转移的自然历史过程，从而创立了唯物主义历史观，使社会学变成了科学。列宁指出，在马克思具体地分析了资本主义经济形态，发现了资本主义的产生、发展和灭亡的规律后，在“资本论”出版后，唯物主义历史观这一假设已经得到科学的论证。
    列宁在保卫马克思主义理论基础的同时，经过深刻的分析和论证，指出了在民粹主义者的理论纲领和策略中丝毫没有社会主义的东西。自由主义民粹派是富农利益的代表者。
    列宁总结对自由主义民粹派的批判说，民粹派以“人民之友”自居，其实他们都是人民的死敌，是社会民主主义者的死敌。列宁在“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”一文中确定了俄国马克思主义者的基本任务，即组成统一的社会主义工人政党。列宁英明地指出了工人阶级斗争的道路，认定工人阶级是社会上先进的革命力量，认定农民是工人阶级的同盟者。
    列宁在反对民粹派的斗争中，也毫不调和地揭露了以司徒卢威为代表的“合法马克思主义者”的自由资产阶级的本质。这些“合法马克思主义者”企图利用工人阶级政党缺乏马克思主义修养，缺乏思想上的团结，缺乏实际锻炼，把自己装成马克思主义者，阉割马克思主义的革命内容，把马克思主义变成改良主义，使工人运动服从资产阶级利益。
    “合法马克思主义者”也反对过民粹派，但他们不是从马克思主义立场上，而是从资产阶级自由主义立场上去批判民粹主义。司徒卢威极力回避资本主义所具有的阶级矛盾，把自己的任务只限于证明资本主义存在的不可避免性和进步性。列宁在揭露司徒卢威的片面性时，指出了他的方法论的基础就是资产阶级客观主义。列宁说，唯物主义和客观主义是有差别的。“客观主义者谈论现有历史过程的必然性；唯物主义者则是确切地肯定现有社会经济形态和它所产生的对抗关系。客观主义者证明现有一系列事实的必然性时，总是不自觉地站到为这些事实做辩护的立场上；唯物主义者则是揭露阶级矛盾，从而确定自己的立场。”“唯物主义本身包含有所谓党性，要求在对事变做任何估计时都必须直率而公开地站到一定社会集团的立场上。”（三七八—三七九页）。
    同时列宁在考察司徒卢威对马克思主义的一个根本问题即国家问题的意见时，揭露了“合法马克思主义者”的资产阶级本质。列宁指出，他们要把资产阶级国家这一资产阶级实行阶级统治的工具看做超阶级的组织，实质上是要使资产阶级国家永远存在下去。
    列宁的“民粹主义的经济内容及其在司徒卢威先生的书中受到的批评”这篇著作，不仅揭露了俄国“合法马克思主义者”的资产阶级本质，而且对反对右翼社会党人的机会主义和修正主义有很大的意义。
    “列宁全集”第一卷中的著作，特别是“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”，是马克思列宁主义文献中极重要的著作。列宁在这些著作中对历史唯物主义理论的阐明和发展，对主观唯心主义和资产阶级客观主义的批判，直到今天仍有极大的现实意义。我们要在列宁全集第一卷的著作中，学习如何用唯物主义的方法来科学地分析和解决我国现实社会经济发展中的新问题，如何同各种科学领域和实际工作中表现出来的唯心主义作不调和的斗争，如何在观察和分析每个问题时具有高度的阶级性和党性，来推进中国的社会主义建设。
