Khrushchev's Speech

Dear friends, respectable citizens of Rangoon:

We are very happy to be able to extend our greetings to you and, through you, to all the people of Burma. We are very happy to convey the friendly greetings of the Soviet people to the people of Burma and wish them further success in strengthening their national sovereignty and independence. (Stormy applause)

During our stay in your country, we visited some cities and historical sites. We received a warm and sincere reception everywhere. We are grateful to the Burmese people for this friendly expression towards the Soviet people. (Stormy applause)

Comrade Prime Minister U Nu recently paid a goodwill visit to the Soviet Union. The Soviet people gave him a warm and sincere welcome. Comrade U Nu and his entourage could see with their own eyes that the Soviet people also view the Burmese people with deep sympathy and friendship. (Applause)

The Soviet people have always spiritually supported the Burmese people's lofty struggle against colonial oppression and their struggle for freedom and national independence. During the Second World War, the Burmese people had to wage a fierce struggle against the Japanese imperialists, a struggle that ended with the expulsion of the interventionists. After the end of that war, the Burmese people resolutely resisted the colonialists' attempts to restore foreign rule in your country. They have achieved victory in the struggle for the national independence of their motherland. (Applause)

When the Burmese people shook off the shackles of colonialism, the Soviet Union was one of the first countries to recognize the political independence of the Union of Burma and establish friendly relations with your country. (Applause)

When Comrade U Nu was in Moscow, he and our leaders exchanged views extensively on issues of common concern to our two countries and on certain international issues. We continued this exchange of views during our stay in Burma. During these conversations, there was agreement on a number of important issues in current international relations, including the issue of maintaining and consolidating world peace. (Applause)

The method of consultation and agreement chosen by peace-loving countries clearly shows that this is the only correct path to ensure the true security of the people.

Significant changes have taken place in the world in recent years. The irresistible desire of oppressed peoples for independence and freedom has become the hallmark of our time. Despite the frantic efforts of the colonialists to maintain their rule in the countries they oppress, the colonial system is collapsing. The colonialists are unwilling to lose their position in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region, and they refuse to recognize the changes that have taken place in the lives of the people of countries that were once colonies and dependencies and have now embarked on the path of independent development. Their interference in the internal affairs of Korea and Indochina has brought bloody wars, making this part of the world a hotbed of a new world war.

Thanks to the joint efforts of peace-loving countries supported by world public opinion, hostilities in Korea and Indochina have been stopped. (Applause)

We are pleased to note that Burma has consistently advocated the cessation of war in these countries and the resolution of disputes through negotiation. The Burmese government, together with other peace-loving countries, has always opposed and continues to oppose joining the aggressive bloc of colonial countries - the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. (Applause) Burma's peaceful foreign policy has been endorsed by the world's progressive forces. (Applause)

The cessation of hostilities in the Pacific region is a great victory for the forces of peace. (Applause) However, many problems remain unresolved in this region, one of the most pressing of which is the Japanese problem. The Soviet Union seeks to resolve the Japanese problem, and it understands the difficulties that the Japanese people are now experiencing. At the same time, the Soviet people sympathize with the concerns of Japan's neighbors who suffered from Japanese militarism during the Second World War. Therefore, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries advocate that the Japanese problem should be resolved in such a way as to make it impossible for aggressive Japanese militarism to revive and for Japan to become a source of a new world war.

In Europe and other parts of the world, there are also many unresolved problems. These problems contribute to the deterioration of international relations. The Soviet government has recently taken a number of diplomatic actions known throughout the world to ease international tensions. (Applause)

All this has created favorable conditions for the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers, which has promoted the relaxation of international tensions.

Since the Geneva Conference of Heads of Government, we have not relaxed our efforts in this regard. As early as May of this year, the Soviet government formulated a plan for the reduction of armaments and armed forces and submitted it to the United Nations for discussion. The Soviet government has also put forward a plan for European collective security. In the spirit of Geneva, the Soviet government has reduced its armed forces by 640,000 men and has also removed its only naval base on foreign territory, giving up its rights to the Porkkala Peninsula base in Finland. (Applause)

The Soviet Union has always been firm and consistent in implementing a peaceful foreign policy. We have consistently advocated disarmament and the banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons. But we are unwilling to carry out unilateral disarmament while Western countries are constantly strengthening their armaments. It would be too foolish if we had no power in the face of aggressive forces, if we could not restrain the mad attempts of imperialists to start a new war. Therefore, we are forced not to relax our attention to the issue of our defense capabilities. (Applause)

The Soviet Union has proposed banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, Western governments have rejected this proposal, saying that they will continue to stockpile atomic bombs. Our scientists and engineers recently detonated a hydrogen bomb with enormous, unprecedented power for scientific research. However, this explosion was carried out at high altitude in order not to endanger the residents. But now, we once again propose a strict ban on the use of atomic weapons.

We do not intend to attack anyone or frighten anyone. We hope that everyone will recognize what war means and stand up resolutely to prevent war, to fight for disarmament in all countries, and to strictly ban atomic and hydrogen weapons. (Prolonged applause)

The Soviet government has firmly and consistently implemented, and will continue to implement, a policy of maintaining peace and promoting cooperation between the peoples of all countries. This policy, which was declared in the first decree of the Soviet regime in October 1917, is in the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities in the multi-ethnic alliance engaged in peaceful construction labor. In our country, everything is done to fully satisfy the material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. We formulate and implement five-year plans, build factories, and construct huge power stations and railways for these purposes. For the welfare of the people, our country is reclaiming wasteland, expanding the planting area of wheat, corn, vegetables, and industrial raw materials, and is struggling to increase the yield per unit area of land and to increase the productivity of animal husbandry. (Applause)

The Soviet state has made great progress in the thirty-eight years since its establishment. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet people, our once backward agricultural country has become a powerful socialist country with first-class industry and highly mechanized agriculture.

National oppression has been forever eliminated in the Soviet Union. (Stormy applause) Those of our country's nationalities that were once backward and oppressed have made great achievements in their economic and cultural development during the Soviet era, and now they have equal status in our country's great family of nationalities. (Stormy applause) The women of our country have truly been liberated and have become equal and active participants in the new life. (Stormy applause)

Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, a cultural revolution has been completed in the Soviet Union. Now the Soviet Union is a country where illiteracy has been eradicated. The Soviet Union is full of schools, other educational institutions, clubs and libraries. All scientific achievements and all cultural treasures can be enjoyed by millions of workers in urban and rural areas. Unemployment has long been eliminated in the Soviet Union. (Stormy applause)

As everyone knows, vast areas of our country were destroyed by the Hitlerite invaders during the Second World War. The people of our country had to spend a great deal of manpower and material resources to rebuild the cities, villages, factories, railways, and highways in these areas.

Although the Soviet people have had to overcome various difficulties, they have won in the struggle for the progress and prosperity of the country. (Applause)

Now our country has accumulated rich construction experience in various sectors of the economy, so it can introduce this experience and knowledge to other peace-loving countries. The Soviet Union is very willing to cooperate with other countries within the framework of the United Nations to provide technical and economic assistance to the people of backward countries. (Applause) The economic development of these backward countries has been hindered by the long-term colonial system.

The people who have been liberated from colonial oppression, including the Burmese people, all hope to achieve economic and cultural prosperity in their own countries and hope to implement social and economic measures that can improve the living conditions of the masses. We understand these aspirations. Therefore, we welcome the expansion of economic and cultural ties between our two countries. We also understand the deep and sincere desire for peace expressed by the Burmese people, because without a consolidated and lasting peace, there can be no economic and cultural progress. (Applause)

The current situation in the Pacific and Southeast Asian regions, the existence of friendly Pacific countries such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, proximity to peace-loving India, etc., have created favorable conditions for the Burmese people to consolidate the independence of their country. (Applause)

Your country is infested with Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who have committed all kinds of atrocities here. I think that without the help of some enemies of Burma, this gang would not have been able to survive for so long. But no matter how hard the colonialists try, they will not be able to stay where the people who have raised the banner of national independence have already driven them away. (Applause)

We know that Burma is an agricultural country. Its trade with other countries can now mainly develop on the basis of selling agricultural products. Because these products are surplus in some countries, some countries want to take advantage of this to force the Union of Burma to accept their conditions.

The Soviet Union has consistently condemned this policy. We hope to develop mutually beneficial trade with Burma. Although our country is not a major buyer of rice, we will do everything we can to buy more Burmese rice and other products exported by the Union of Burma. You can purchase our goods based on the amount of goods you export to us. (Applause)

This is trade that is mutually beneficial to both countries without any political obligations. This trade will help further develop our relations and consolidate our countries. (Applause)

We firmly believe that the Burmese people will never allow anyone to interfere in their internal affairs and will do everything they can to further develop their country independently.

Dear friends!

Tomorrow we will leave your hospitable country and return to your great neighbor, the Republic of India.

Our visits to India and Burma have given us a better understanding of the vital interests of your two countries. But some gentlemen do not like our visits to India and Burma, and they do not like our speeches and frank conversations. But we have always told the truth, and the truth is often not liked by everyone, just as the saying goes: faithful words are unpleasant to the ear. (Applause)

That is why my speeches with Bulganin in India aroused the anger of some British newspapers. What they particularly disliked was a sentence I said in one of my speeches: Some people indulged Hitler in launching the war against the Soviet Union.

This is, after all, a historical fact.

Indeed, if Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries had united to jointly confront Hitler, could he have launched the war?

If the rulers of Britain and France at that time had been willing to restrain Hitler and prevent him from launching the war, they would have stopped Hitler from annexing Austria and would not have concluded the shameful Munich Agreement.

As everyone knows, France had concluded a treaty of mutual assistance with Czechoslovakia. But when Hitler began to occupy Czechoslovakia, the French government refused to help Czechoslovakia, although it was clear that the Soviet Union was ready to immediately come out to help stop Hitler's aggression. The Soviet army was then fully prepared to jointly counter Hitler's aggression against Czechoslovakia with the French army, which was not a secret. But the French government refused to do so.

The history of the pre-war years convincingly proves that Western countries repeatedly made concessions to Hitler in order to drive him east to invade our country. However, things developed in the opposite direction. The running dog, which was raised by the ruling groups of Britain, France, and the United States as a watchdog to oppose the Soviet Union, broke free from its chains and turned to pounce on its master.

Then the question arises: If we study the measures taken towards present-day West Germany, can we also see some similarities with the pre-war period? Are not the same countries now acting in the same way in order to drive West Germany onto the road of aggression and new adventures?

They dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They are allocating funds to arm West Germany and giving it weapons. Many leaders in Western countries even feel it is unnecessary to conceal the fact that they are training West German troops to fight against the Soviet Union.

British journalists, why do you resent it when we recall one or two things from the past? (Lively atmosphere in the hall)

I would also like to say the following. Russia has never waged war against Britain, but whether in the past or in our Soviet era, Britain has invaded our country. It is worth mentioning examples such as the Sevastopol War. At that time, the Russians did not invite the British to come to Crimea to slaughter Russians on our Russian soil. We can also mention the British armed intervention in our motherland during the years of the domestic war. When the Soviet Republic had not yet been consolidated, British troops occupied Arkhangelsk. They came to us not as friends but as enemies, shedding the blood of us Soviet people on our Soviet soil until they were driven out of our country. (Stormy applause)

All these are also historical facts that cannot be escaped!

Finally, please recall Mr. Churchill's infamous instructions to his commanders in the European theater near the end of the Second World War. At that time, Churchill ordered the collection and preservation of the weapons discarded by the surrendered Hitler troops, and to keep these troops in a state of combat readiness, because they might be useful in the fight against the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union was Britain's ally.

We are accustomed to always telling the truth and honestly facing the truth, even if it is unpleasant. (Applause)

All our actions prove that we do not want to conflict with Western countries. We advocate genuine friendship with Britain, France, the United States, and other countries. We hope to be friendly with the people of all countries in the world. We not only have this hope, but we are also actively fighting for world peace and for cooperation in the affairs between all countries. (Stormy applause)

But, it is clear that some people do not very much like our current establishment of the most friendly relations with the people of countries such as India and Burma. Not to mention our great friend and brother - the People's Republic of China, with whom we have permanently formed the most solid, sincere, and selfless brotherly relationship.

Also, some people do not like our support for those countries that have overthrown colonial oppression and are now advancing along their respective paths. We have always supported the aspirations of the people of these countries to fight for their national liberation. What we sincerely feel happy about is that they have not only gained political freedom, but are also advancing along new paths, although this makes the gentlemen of Britain, France, and the United States feel unhappy.

Some newspapers do not like historical truths. I am sure they will not like today's truths either. But the truth is, after all, the truth, and I must speak it. For example: There is a question: Why do American troops occupy the island of Taiwan, a part of the legitimate territory of the People's Republic of China, and other islands near it? Why do they hinder the Chinese people from recovering their own territory?

But not a single bourgeois journalist dares to raise a voice against this action. In the British newspapers, there is also no serious protest against the atrocities of the Portuguese colonialists who illegally seized Goa, an indivisible part of India.

Obviously, the colonialists have not yet given up their plans and actions, although the era of their rule is gone forever. We speak openly and frankly in this way.

We can also cite the fact that the great country, the People's Republic of China, has been growing and strengthening for more than six years. However, some countries, contrary to common sense, are hindering the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Chiang Kai-shek's elements are trying to represent the Chinese people in the United Nations. This is an extremely unfair practice. But the British newspapers do not oppose this strange phenomenon, but only make some innocuous generalities about it.

People should not think that I intend to teach anyone a lesson. No, I am just citing facts. And facts speak louder than words!

I would also like to talk about the events of the Second World War again. As everyone knows, when Hitler's Germany perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union, when we were allies of France, Britain, and the United States in the struggle against Hitler's Germany, our country faithfully and earnestly fulfilled its obligations as an ally.

In this war, the Soviet people shed far more blood than all our allies combined, but we respect and praise the armies of Britain, France, the United States, and other countries that fought against Hitler's Germany and its vassal states. The struggle was harsh, but the armies of our allied countries achieved a great victory in the struggle for the bright future of mankind, for the freedom and independence of mankind, and against bloody Hitlerism.

This experience of joint struggle for a common cause is of great significance. The Second World War showed that the British, French, Americans, and Soviets can not only be excellent friends in peacetime, but also excellent friends in the years of the most severe and difficult tests. Since we were allies in the war, what can prevent us from becoming equally good friends in the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace?

We have said repeatedly that the Soviet people advocate lasting peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries. We not only say this, but we are also striving to develop and consolidate this friendship.

Frankly speaking, these are some of the things I wanted to say about the comments made by the British newspapers on my speeches and the speeches of Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin.

Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Burma, on my own behalf and on behalf of my friend Comrade Bulganin and all the friends who accompanied us on our visit to Burma, for your warm reception. (Stormy applause)

We would like to express special thanks to Comrade U Nu for his sincere attitude towards us and our country. (Stormy applause) Because he correctly understood and appreciated the friendly feelings of the people of all nationalities in our country towards the Burmese people, he did not hesitate to promote the approach of the Union of Burma to the Soviet Union and to develop and consolidate the friendship between our two peoples. (Stormy and prolonged applause) He did this for the benefit of his own country, and it also shows his broad vision. (Applause)

The Prime Minister of Burma called me and Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin comrades. Yes, we are comrades in the common struggle for peace and friendship. (Applause) This comradeship will grow and consolidate day by day on the most sincere basis. This relationship will develop between the politicians of our two countries and between our two countries, for the benefit of the people of our two countries. (Applause)

Please allow me to once again wish you, esteemed President Ba U, wish you, Comrade U Nu, wish you, friends who participated in this gathering, and wish all the Burmese people success in the cause of consolidating your country's independence! (Stormy and prolonged applause)

May the friendship between the people of Burma and the Soviet Union grow and flourish! (All stand up, emitting stormy cheers)

### 赫鲁晓夫的讲话

1955-12-08
第4版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫的讲话亲爱的朋友们，可敬的仰光市民们：
    我们很高兴能够向你们致意，并且通过你们向全体缅甸人民致意，我们很高兴能够向缅甸人民转达苏联人民的友好的致意，并且祝他们在加强他们的国家的主权和独立中取得进一步的成功。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们在你们的国家停留期间，访问了一些城市和古迹。我们到处都受到了热烈和诚挚的接待。我们对于缅甸人民对苏联人民的这种友好的表现表示感谢。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    缅甸总理吴努同志最近曾经到苏联进行了亲善访问。苏联人民曾经给予他热烈和诚挚的欢迎。吴努同志和他的一行人可以亲眼看到，苏联人民也是怀着深深的同情和友谊来看待缅甸人民的。（掌声）
    苏联人民一向在精神上支持缅甸人民反对殖民压迫的崇高的斗争，支持他们为争取自由和民族独立而进行的斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，缅甸人民不得不对日本帝国主义者进行激烈的斗争，这个斗争以干涉者的被驱逐出去而告终。在那次战争结束之后，缅甸人民坚决反抗殖民主义者想要在你们的国家恢复外国统治的企图。他们在争取他们的祖国的民族独立的斗争中已经取得了胜利。（掌声）
    当缅甸人民摆脱了殖民主义羁绊的时候，苏联是首先承认缅甸联邦的政治上的独立并且和你们的国家建立友好关系的国家之一。（掌声）
    当吴努同志在莫斯科的时候，他和我国领袖之间曾就我们两国共同有关的问题和某些国际问题广泛地交换了意见。我们在缅甸逗留期间又继续了这种意见的交换。在这些交谈中间，在一些目前国际关系的重要问题上有了一致的意见，其中包括维护和巩固世界和平的问题。（掌声）
    爱好和平的国家所选择的协商和协议的办法，明白地显示出这是确保人民的真正安全的唯一正确的道路。
    最近几年间，世界上发生了重大的变化。被压迫人民对独立和自由的不可遏止的愿望已经成了我们这个时代的标志。尽管殖民主义者疯狂地努力要维持他们在受他们压迫的国家内的统治，殖民制度还是在崩溃中。殖民主义者不甘心丧失他们在东南亚和太平洋地区的地位，他们不肯承认曾经一度是殖民地和附属国而现在已经走上了独立发展的道路的国家的人民的生活中所已经发生的变化。他们对朝鲜和印度支那的内政进行的干涉带来了血腥战争，这使世界的这个部分成了新的世界大战的温床。
    由于受到世界舆论支持的爱好和平国家的共同努力，朝鲜和印度支那的敌对行动才得以停止。
  （掌声）
    我们高兴地指出，缅甸一贯主张停止这些国家的战争，主张用谈判的方式解决争端。缅甸政府同其他爱好和平的国家一道过去和现在始终反对参加殖民国家的侵略集团——东南亚条约组织。（掌声）缅甸的和平外交政策得到世界进步力量的赞同。（掌声）
    太平洋地区敌对行动的停止，是和平力量的巨大胜利。（掌声）但是，在这个地区还有很多问题没有解决，其中最迫切的问题之一就是日本问题。苏联力求解决日本问题，它了解到日本人民现在所经受的困难。同时，苏联人民同情在第二次世界大战中曾经遭受日本军国主义祸害的日本邻国的担心。因此，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家都主张这样来解决日本问题，就是使复活侵略性的日本军国主义和变日本为新世界大战的策源地成为不可能。
    在欧洲和世界其他部分，也有很多没有解决的问题。这些问题促使国际关系恶化。苏联政府最近采取了一些全世界都知道的外交行动，来缓和国际紧张局势。（掌声）
    这一切都为四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的召开创造了有利条件，这个会议促进了国际紧张局势的缓和。
    政府首脑日内瓦会议以后，我们也没有放松在这方面的努力。早在今年五月苏联政府就拟定了一项裁减军备和武装部队的计划，并且把它提交联合国讨论。苏联政府还提出了一项欧洲集体安全计划。苏联政府本着日内瓦精神，把自己的武装部队裁减了六十四万人，而且还撤除了自己在外国领土上的唯一的一个海军基地，放弃了对芬兰波卡拉半岛基地的权利。（掌声）
    苏联始终是坚定地和一贯地执行着和平外交政策。我们一贯主张裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器。但是在西方国家不断加强自己的军备的时候，我们不愿意实行单方面的裁军。如果我们在侵略势力的面前没有力量，如果我们不能约束帝国主义者想发动新战争的疯狂企图，那就是太愚蠢了。因此，我们被迫不能放松对自己防御能力的问题的注意。（掌声）
    苏联曾经提议禁止原子武器和氢武器。然而西方国家政府拒绝这个建议，并且说他们将继续储备原子弹。我们的科学家和工程师为进行科学研究，不久以前曾爆炸了一颗有巨大的、空前的威力的氢弹。不过，这次爆炸是在高空进行的，为的是不使居民遭受到危害。但是现在，我们再一次提议严格禁止使用原子武器。
    我们并不打算进攻谁，不想吓唬谁。我们希望大家都能认识到战争意味着什么，并且起来坚决地为防止战争、为争取一切国家裁减军备、为严格地禁止原子武器和氢武器而斗争。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联政府坚定和一贯地执行了，并将继续执行维护和平和各国人民之间、一切国家之间实行合作的政策。一九一七年十月在苏维埃政权第一个命令中就宣布的这个政策是符合从事和平建设劳动的多民族联盟的各族人民的根本利益的。在我国，一切都是为了最充分地满足苏联人的物质和文化需要。我们制定和执行五年计划，建筑工厂，建设巨大的发电站和铁路，都是为了这些目的。为了人民的福利，我国在开垦荒地，扩大小麦、玉蜀黍、蔬菜、工业原料作物的播种面积，并且在为提高土地的单位面积产量，为提高畜牧业的产品生产率而斗争。
  （掌声）
    苏维埃国家建立三十八年以来有了巨大的发展。由于苏联人民的努力，我们这个过去落后的农业国变成了强大的、拥有头等工业和高度机械化的农业的社会主义国家。
    在苏联永远消灭了民族压迫。（暴风雨般的掌声）我国那些过去是落后的和受压迫的民族在苏维埃政权年代里在自己的经济和文化发展方面获得了巨大的成就，现在它们在我国各族人民大家庭中有着平等的地位。（暴风雨般的掌声）我国的妇女已经真正获得了解放，成了新生活的平等的和积极的参加者。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏维埃政权建立以来，在苏联完成了文化革命。现在苏联是一个文盲绝迹的国家。苏联布满了学校、其他教育机构、俱乐部和图书馆。所有科学成就和一切文化宝藏都能够为千千万万的城乡劳动者所享受。在苏联老早已经消灭了失业现象。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    大家知道，在第二次世界大战期间我国的广大地区曾经遭到希特勒侵略者的破坏。我国人民曾经不得不花费大量的人力物力来重新恢复这些地区的城市、乡村、工厂、铁路和公路。
    虽然苏联人民曾经不得不克服种种困难，但是他们在争取国家的进步和繁荣的斗争中取得了胜利。（掌声）
    现在我们的国家在经济各部门中积累了丰富的建设经验，所以它可以把这些经验和知识介绍给其他爱好和平的国家，苏联很愿意同其他国家在联合国给予落后国家的人民以技术和经济援助的范围内进行合作，（掌声）这些落后国家的经济发展曾经受到长期的殖民制度的阻挠。
    从殖民压迫下解放出来的人民、包括缅甸人民在内，都希望求得自己国家的经济和文化的繁荣，希望实行可以改善人民群众生活条件的社会和经济措施，这些愿望我们是理解的。因此，我们欢迎扩大我们两国之间的经济和文化联系。缅甸人民对和平所表示的深刻和恳切的愿望，我们也是理解的，因为，没有巩固的和持久的和平，就不能有经济和文化的进步。（掌声）
    太平洋和东南亚区域的目前形势，如苏联、中华人民共和国这样一些友好的太平洋国家的存在，越南民主共和国的成立，同爱好和平的印度的毗邻等等，替缅甸人民创造了巩固自己国家的独立的有利条件。（掌声）
    你们的国土上盘踞着蒋介石匪帮，这个匪帮在这里干下了种种暴行。我想，要不是缅甸的某些敌人的帮助，这个匪帮未必能维持这样长久。但是，不论殖民者花费多大气力，他们是不能够在高举民族独立旗帜的人民已经把他们赶走的地方留下来的。（掌声）
    我们知道，缅甸是一个农业国家。它同其他国家的贸易现在主要只能在出售农产品的基础上发展。因为在有些国家中这些产品过剩，所以某些国家就想利用这一点来硬使缅甸联邦接受自己的条件。
    苏联一贯谴责这种政策。我们希望同缅甸发展互利的贸易。虽然我们的国家不是大米的大买主，我们也要竭尽一切力量更多地向你们购买缅甸联邦输出的大米和其他产品。你们可以根据你们向我们输出的商品数额来购买我们的货物。（掌声）
    这就是没有任何政治义务的、对于两国互利的贸易。这种贸易将有助于我们的关系的进一步发展和我们的国家的巩固。（掌声）
    我们坚决相信，缅甸人民决不会让任何人来干涉自己的内政，并且将竭尽一切力量使自己国家得到进一步的独立发展。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    明天我们就要离开你们的好客的国家，回到你们伟大的邻国印度共和国去。
    我们访问过印度和缅甸之后，使我们对你们两个国家的切身利益更加了解了。但是，有些先生很不喜欢我们访问印度和缅甸，不喜欢我们的演说和坦率的谈话。但是，我们过去和现在始终讲真理，而真理往往并不是人人都喜欢的，正像俗语所说的：忠言逆耳。（掌声）
    这就是为什么我和布尔加宁同志在印度发表的演说引起了英国一些报纸的愤怒的缘故。它们特别不喜欢的是我在某次演说中讲的这样一句话：有些人放纵希特勒发动了对苏联的战争。
    这毕竟是历史事实。
    的确，如果英国、法国、苏联和其他国家联合起来共同对抗希特勒，难道他能发动战争吗？
    如果当时英国和法国的执政者愿意约束希特勒，不让他发动战争，他们就会去阻止希特勒并吞奥地利，就不会去缔结可耻的慕尼黑协定。
    大家知道，法国曾经同捷克斯洛伐克缔结过互助条约。但是，当希特勒开始占领捷克斯洛伐克的时候，法国政府却拒绝帮助捷克斯洛伐克，虽然它很清楚，苏联是准备立即出来帮助制止希特勒侵略的。苏联军队当时已经整装以待，准备同法国军队共同反击希特勒对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，这并不是秘密。但是法国政府拒绝这样做。
    战前年代的历史令人信服地证明，西方国家曾经一再向希特勒让步，为的是驱使他向东来侵犯我国。然而，事情朝着相反的方向发展，当时被英国、法国和美国的统治集团当作看门狗豢养的，以便用来反对苏联的走狗挣脱了锁链，转而扑向豢养它的主人。
    于是就产生了这样一个问题：如果我们研究一下对现在的西德所采取的措施，是不是也可以看出某些同战前时期类似的情况呢？为了驱使西德走上侵略和新冒险的道路，同样的那些国家现在不正在以同样的方法行事吗？
    它们把西德拖入了北大西洋公约组织。它们拨款武装西德，给它武器。西方国家的许多领导人甚至认为没有必要隐瞒他们在训练西德军队来反对苏联。
    英国记者先生，当我们回忆过去的一两件事情的时候，你们何必见怪呢？（场内活跃）
    我还想说下面这些话。俄国从来没有对英国发动过战争，但是不论在过去，不论在我们苏维埃时代，英国都侵犯过我们的国家。值得提一提像塞瓦斯托波尔战争这样的例子。当时俄国人并没有邀请英国人来到克里米亚在我们的俄国土地上屠杀俄国人。还可以提一提在国内战争年代中英国对我们的祖国进行的武装干涉。当苏维埃共和国还没有巩固的时候，英国军队占领了亚尔汉格尔。他们不是以朋友的身份而是作为敌人来到了我们那里，在我们的苏维埃国土上使我们苏联人流血，一直到他们从我们的国土上被赶出去为止。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    所有这一切也都是无法逃避的历史事实！
    最后请回忆回忆邱吉尔先生在第二次世界大战快要结束的时候向他在欧洲战场的司令官所发布的臭名远扬的指示。当时邱吉尔命令搜集和保藏已经投降的希特勒部队所丢下的武器，并且使这些军队保持战斗准备状态，因为它们可能在对苏联的战斗中有用，虽然苏联是英国的盟国。
    我们习惯于始终说真话和老老实实地正视真理，即使它是令人不愉快的。（掌声）
    我们的一切行动证明，我们不想同西方国家发生冲突。我们主张同英国、法国、美国和其他国家有真正的友谊。我们希望同全世界各国人民友好。我们不仅有这种希望，而且还积极地在为世界和平、为各国之间事务上的合作而奋斗。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    但是，很明显，有人不很喜欢我们现在同印度、缅甸等国家的人民结成最友好的关系。更不用说我们的伟大的朋友和兄弟——中华人民共和国了，我们已经同它永久地结成了最巩固、最真挚和无私的兄弟关系。
    还有，有人不喜欢我们支持那些已经推翻了殖民压迫、现在正沿着各自的道路前进的国家。我们始终支持这些国家的人民争取自己民族解放的愿望。我们所真诚地感到愉快的是，他们不仅得到了政治自由，而且还在沿着新的道路前进，虽然这使英国、法国和美国的先生们感到不愉快。
    某些报纸不喜欢历史真相。我确信，它们也不会喜欢今天的真相。但是，真相毕竟是真相，我必须讲。例如：有这样一个问题：为什么美国军队要占领中华人民共和国的合法领土的一部分台湾岛和它邻近的其他岛屿呢？为什么它们要阻挠中国人民收复自己的领土呢？
    但是，没有一个资产阶级新闻记者敢发出反对这种行动的呼声。在英国的报纸上，也不见有人认真抗议非法窃据印度不可分割的一部分果阿的葡萄牙殖民者的暴行。
    显然，殖民者还没有放弃自己的计划和行动，虽然他们的统治的时代已经是一去不复返了。我们公开和直率地这样讲。
    还可以举出这样一件事实：伟大的国家中华人民共和国的成长和壮大，至今已经有六年多了。但是，某些国家却违背常理地阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。蒋介石分子企图在联合国中代表中国人民。这是极其不公平的做法。但是，英国报纸并不反对这种怪现象，而只对它作些不得罪人的泛泛之谈。
    人们不要认为，我打算教训谁。不是，我只不过举出事实。而事实胜于雄辩！
    我还想再谈谈第二次世界大战时期的事件。大家知道，当希特勒德国背信弃义地进攻苏联的时候，当我们在反对希特勒德国的斗争中是法国、英国和美国的盟友的时候，我们的国家忠实地和认真地履行了盟友的义务。
    在这个战争中苏联人民所流的血比我们的所有盟友总共流的血都要多得多，但是我们尊重和赞扬同希特勒德国和它的仆从国作战的英国、法国、美国和其他国家的军队。斗争曾经是严酷的，但是我们同盟国军队在争取人类的光明前途、争取人类的自由和独立以及反对血腥的希特勒主义的斗争中取得了极其伟大的胜利。
    为了共同事业而联合斗争的这个经验是有重大意义的。第二次世界大战表明，英国人、法国人、美国人和苏联人不但在平时可以成为极好的朋友，而且在最严酷和艰苦的考验的年代中也可以作极好的朋友。既然我们在战争中曾经是盟友，那末什么东西能够阻碍我们在争取维护和巩固和平的斗争中成为同样的好朋友呢？
    我们再三说，苏联人民主张持久和平和各国人民之间的友谊。我们不但这样说，而且我们在尽力发展和巩固这种友谊。
    老实说，这就是我对英国报纸对我的讲话和尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁的讲话所作的某些评论要说的一些话。
    最后我想以我个人的名义并且代表我的朋友布尔加宁同志以及随同我们到缅甸访问的全体朋友向缅甸政府和人民表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们对我们的热情接待。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们要对吴努同志对待我们和我们国家的真挚的态度特别表示感谢。（暴风雨般的掌声）他由于正确地了解和估价我们国家各族人民对缅甸人民的友好感情，所以没有顾忌地促使缅甸联邦同苏联接近，没有顾忌地发展和巩固我们两国人民之间的友谊。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）他这样做是为了自己国家的利益，同时也说明他的眼光远大。（掌声）
    缅甸总理把我和尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁叫做同志。是的，我们是在争取和平和友谊的共同斗争中的同志。（掌声）这种同志的关系将在最真诚的基础上一天天地成长和巩固。这种关系将在我们两国政治家之间和我们两国之间得到发展，以有利于我们两国人民。（掌声）
    请允许我再一次祝你，敬爱的总统巴宇博士，祝你，吴努同志，祝你们，参加这次集会的朋友们，祝全体缅甸人民在巩固你们国家的独立的事业中获得成功！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    缅甸和苏联两国人民的友谊日益发展，日益昌盛！（全体起立，发出暴风雨般的欢呼）
