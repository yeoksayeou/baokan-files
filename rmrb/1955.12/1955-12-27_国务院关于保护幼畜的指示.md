    State Council Directive on the Protection of Young Livestock
    Currently, some agricultural production cooperatives are focusing solely on immediate interests, prioritizing strong draught animals while neglecting the care of young livestock, leading to an increase in the number of young animals on the market in some areas and a drop in prices. This short-sighted approach is undesirable and must be rectified immediately. It must be recognized that draught animals are a major driving force in agricultural production now and for a considerable period to come. Raising a young animal well now means strengthening our farming capacity that much more in two or three years. If we do not vigorously protect and breed young livestock now, the existing old and weak draught animals will soon be culled, and there will be no strong animals to replace them, which will cause enormous difficulties for agricultural production. To this end, the following instructions are hereby issued:
    1. Education should be conducted within agricultural production cooperatives in all areas. The cooperatives should, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning for all draught animals, and formulate practical and feasible measures to ensure that the young animals within the cooperative are well raised. All cooperatives that adopt the method of converting the value of draught animals into shares or the method of private ownership, public raising, and public use of draught animals, should, when absorbing livestock into the cooperative, absorb young animals at the same time as their mothers, and the cooperative should be responsible for raising them well. After the young animals have grown, the cooperative and the livestock owner should negotiate methods according to local customs to reasonably share the benefits, or the animals should belong entirely to the livestock owner, who pays the cooperative a feeding fee, or the animals should belong entirely to the cooperative, which pays the livestock owner a reasonable price. For young animals that members wish to keep for private raising, the cooperative should help the members solve the problem of fodder. Cooperatives that adopt the method of private ownership, private raising, and public use of draught animals should also help members solve the problem of feed and raise young animals well. The problem of fodder for the entire cooperative, village, and township should be resolved in accordance with the methods of unified arrangement and overall planning.
    Cooperatives should take active measures to breed young livestock. When cooperatives implement the conversion of the value of draught animals into shares or rent or hire members' draught animals, they must not exclude female animals, and should pay attention to protecting female animals during service to avoid reducing conception rates and preventing miscarriage in pregnant animals. Mutual aid teams and individual farmers should also earnestly do a good job in protecting and breeding young livestock. State-owned farms and ranches should do an even better job in protecting female animals and young livestock, and play an exemplary role.
    2. In the work of unified purchase and sale of grain in all areas, sufficient feed grain must be reserved for young and pregnant livestock. In order to encourage the breeding of draught animals, young animals may be allowed to retain grain according to the standard for general draught animals, and pregnant animals should be allowed to retain about one-fifth more than general draught animals in the local area. Specific standards shall be determined by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government.
    3. Farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers who raise young livestock should be given preferential treatment in the form of reduced agricultural taxes. Except for pastoral areas and provinces and regions where animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion, the following provisions can be roughly made in general agricultural areas: In areas where the tax amount is calculated based on rice, millet, and sorghum, deduct 20 jin of tax per head of young livestock; in areas where the tax amount is calculated based on wheat, rice, and millet, deduct 15 jin per head of young livestock. Specific calculation standards shall be determined by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government.
    4. When agricultural production cooperatives purchase, rent, or hire members' draught animals, they must adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, classify them according to quality, and offer fair prices or assess reasonable rents. The pricing should be based on the average price for one year as the standard, slightly higher than the market prices after autumn and winter. This is closely related to increasing the enthusiasm of farmers to breed young livestock.
    5. Commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments in each province and county must pay attention to the surplus and shortage of draught animals in their respective provinces and counties, do a good job in regulating strong animals and culling old animals, strengthen the management of the draught animal market, and appropriately increase the prices of draught animals to stimulate the enthusiasm of farmers to protect and breed young livestock. The work of regulating draught animals between provinces shall be the responsibility of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.
    6. Protecting young livestock is an important task for breeding draught animals and improving agricultural production. All areas should pay serious attention to this issue. After receiving this directive, they should immediately check the situation of young livestock protection in their respective areas and quickly communicate this directive to all counties, districts, and townships for earnest implementation.

### 国务院关于保护幼畜的指示

    国务院关于保护幼畜的指示
    现在有些农业生产合作社单纯从眼前利益打算，只要强壮的耕畜，不注意爱护幼畜，以致有些地方幼畜上市量增多，价格下跌。这种只顾目前不顾将来的现象，是不好的，必须立即纠正。应该认识：耕畜在目前和将来相当长的一个时期内，是农业生产的一项主要动力。现在多养好一头幼畜，就是为两三年后多增强一分耕作力量。如果现在不大力保护和繁殖幼畜，不久以后，现有的老弱耕畜淘汰了，壮畜接济不上，农业生产就会遭遇到极大的困难。为此，现作如下的指示：
    一、各地应该在农业生产合作社内进行教育，由合作社按照对所有耕畜全面统筹安排的精神，并且定出切实可行的办法，使社内的幼畜都能养好。凡是采取耕畜折价归社办法的合作社，和采取耕畜私有公养公用办法的合作社，在吸收牲畜入社的时候，对于幼畜，应该和母畜同时吸收，由社负责养好。幼畜长成以后，由合作社和畜主按照当地习惯，协商办法，合理分益，或者全归畜主，由畜主给合作社付出饲养的报酬，或者全归合作社，由社付给畜主以合理的代价。对于社员愿意留下私养的幼畜，合作社应该帮助社员解决草料的困难。采取耕畜私有私养公用办法的合作社，也应该帮助社员解决饲料的困难，养好幼畜。应按照统一安排，全面规划的方法，解决全社、全村、全乡的饲料问题。
    合作社对于繁殖幼畜应该采取积极措施。合作社实行耕畜折价归社或者租用、雇用社员耕畜的时候，不得排斥母畜，并且在役使中要注意保护母畜，以免减少受胎率，防止孕畜流产。互助组和个体农民也应该切实做好幼畜的保护繁殖工作。国营农场、牧场对于母畜和幼畜，更要做好保护工作，发挥示范作用。
    二、各地在粮食统购统销工作中，对于幼畜、孕畜必须留给充足的饲料粮。为鼓励繁殖耕畜，幼畜可以按一般耕畜的留粮标准留粮，孕畜应该比当地一般耕畜多留五分之一左右。具体标准由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会决定。
    三、对于饲养幼畜的农场、农业生产合作社和农户，应该给予减征农业税的优待。除了牧业区和牧业占较大比例的省区以外，在一般农业区可大体作如下规定：在按稻谷、粟谷、高粱计算税额的地区，每头幼畜扣除税额二十市斤；在按小麦、大米、小米计算税额的地区，每头幼畜扣除十五市斤。具体计算标准由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会决定。
    四、农业生产合作社收买、租用或雇用社员耕畜的时候，必须坚持自愿互利的原则，按质分等，公道作价，或者评定合理的租价，作价应该以一年的平均价格作标准，稍高于秋后和冬季的市场价格。这对于提高农民繁殖幼畜的积极性是有密切关系的。
    五、各省各县的商业和供销合作部门，必须注意本省、本县耕畜的余缺情况，做好壮畜调剂和老畜淘汰的工作，并且加强耕畜市场的管理，适当提高耕畜价格，刺激农民保护和繁殖幼畜的积极性。省与省之间的耕畜调剂工作，由全国供销合作总社负责。
    六、保护幼畜是繁殖耕畜、提高农业生产的一项重要工作。各地应该严重地注意这个问题，在接到这个指示以后，应该立即检查本地区内保护幼畜的情况，并且把这个指示迅速传达到各县、各区、各乡，切实贯彻执行。
                      总理周恩来
                        一九五五年十二月十七日
