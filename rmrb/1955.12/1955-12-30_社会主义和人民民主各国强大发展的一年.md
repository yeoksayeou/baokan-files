    A Year of Strong Development for Socialist and People's Democratic Countries
    Cheng Guangrui, Chen Wei
    History is about to step into 1956. In welcoming the New Year, the nine hundred million free and joyful people living in the socialist family are reviewing the path they have taken with excitement and inspecting the results of their hard work over the past year.
    1955 was a fruitful year for the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The people of these countries have achieved brilliant victories in the cause of safeguarding peace and building socialism and communism.
    The past year was a year of strong economic growth for the entire socialist camp.
    The Soviet Union had already completed the industrial targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule by May 1 this year, in four years and four months. The task of developing the national economy under the Fifth Five-Year Plan is being overfulfilled. According to preliminary statistics, the Soviet Union's total industrial output in 1955 increased by 12 percent compared to 1954. Now, the Soviet Union's industrial level has reached 318 percent of the pre-war level in 1940. In 1955, the Soviet Union's output of pig iron reached more than 33 million tons, steel 45 million tons, coal 390 million tons, and oil 70 million tons. The strong development of Soviet heavy industry has promoted the overall economic growth of the Soviet Union and strengthened its national defense capabilities.
    The rapid development of electrification is one of the important characteristics of the Soviet Union's communist construction. In 1955, the Soviet Union's electricity production will reach 166 billion kilowatt-hours. The electricity generated in one day now is equal to the electricity generated in the entire year of 1920, when the electrification plan was first formulated! This year, the Kakhovka Hydropower Station and the Gorky Hydropower Station and other hydropower stations have begun generating electricity, and the huge Kuibyshev Hydropower Station is also about to begin generating electricity. Preparations have begun for the construction of the world's largest hydraulic project, the Bratsk Hydropower Station. The power generation of this hydropower station is approximately equal to the sum of the power generation of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station.
    The achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy have opened up new and broad prospects for the rapid development of production.
    The speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union is unprecedented. In the past 25 years (excluding war years), Soviet industry has increased by an average of 18.2 percent per year, while the industrial level of the United States has only increased by 2.4 percent per year, the United Kingdom by 3.6 percent, and France by 2.1 percent during the same period.
    As a result of the Soviet people's efforts to implement the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on further developing agriculture, Soviet agriculture also made significant progress in 1955. The original task of reclaiming 30 million hectares of wasteland has been completed one year and two months ahead of schedule. The sown area has expanded by 27 percent compared to 1950. Although the climatic conditions were not good this year, the total grain harvest for the year was still higher than last year.
    1955 is the third year of China's First Five-Year Plan. Many industrial sectors have overfulfilled their production tasks and are drafting new plans to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The rapid growth of production marks the significant development of China's socialist industrialization. The total industrial output value of the country in 1955 will increase by about 62 percent compared to 1952, with an average annual increase of 17.5 percent in three years. The upsurge of the socialist mass movement in China's rural areas in 1955 is a major event of world significance. It can now be determined that the large-scale semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization, including 500 million people, can be realized within the next year. In 1955, China's national grain output reached more than 180 million tons, and cotton output reached more than 1.4 million tons, both of which created the highest records in China's history. The grand plan for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River heralds the bright future of China's electrification. The rapid growth of industry and agriculture in China illustrates how enormous the strength of the 600 million people is as they advance along the glorious road of socialism.
    1955 was also a year in which the European People's Democratic countries continued to make great strides on the road to building socialism. In this year, many exciting new reports were heard from the industrial production front of the Eastern European countries: Poland's steel production per capita was about three times higher than before the war, Czechoslovakia completed the world's pioneering achievement of directly smelting steel using poor iron ore, Hungary's largest Borsod Chemical Combine went into production, Romania's oil production exceeded 10 million tons, and Bulgaria built the country's first dry dock... On this land from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic coast, new factories, new mines, new cities, and tall dams appeared in 1955. The commissioning of a large number of new industrial enterprises has significantly increased the industrial production of the European People's Democratic countries compared to last year, and is equivalent to more than three and a half times that of the pre-war period. Due to the rapid development of industry, the proportion of industrial production of the European People's Democratic countries in the entire European economy has increased by about one time compared to 1948.
    Agriculture in the European People's Democratic countries also achieved new successes in 1955. The agricultural production harvests in various countries this year were unprecedented in the past decade. The cause of agricultural cooperativization has made new progress. Many new agricultural production cooperatives have been established, and the existing ones have also expanded their membership. Socialist components in agriculture generally account for about one-third of the country's cultivated land, while in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, they exceed 40 percent and 61 percent respectively.
    Asian People's Democratic countries have also made remarkable achievements in developing their economies and cultures. With the cooperation of the Soviet Union and fraternal People's Democratic countries, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have rapidly restored enterprises destroyed by the war and built new factories and mines. This year, industrial production has exceeded the pre-war level. Their efforts have strengthened the democratic base of Korea and are conducive to the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea. In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, people have lived and worked in peace and contentment. Coal mines, textile industries, and various handicrafts have resumed production, water conservancy is being widely developed, and agriculture has also achieved a bumper harvest. The stable development and great achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have attracted the attention of the broad masses of people in South Vietnam, strengthening the power of the Vietnamese people to strive for peaceful reunification. The Mongolian People's Republic has also made new achievements in developing its animal husbandry and industry.
    The soaring economic power of the socialist camp further strengthens the camp's strength. Every achievement of the countries in the socialist camp adds to the strength of the cause of world peace.
    In 1955, the Soviet Union spent its glorious 38th anniversary, and the European and Asian People's Democratic countries celebrated the anniversaries of their new births with new achievements. The People's Republic of China, which was born only six years ago, has developed into a powerful force in the cause of world peace and socialism. All these achievements prove the superiority of the socialist system. The socialist ideology, which represents the future of mankind, radiated even more brilliantly in 1955.
    1955 was a year in which the sincere cooperation and friendly unity among the countries of the socialist camp continued to increase. The signing of the Warsaw Treaty, the signing of the treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the visits of Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the Soviet Union, China, and the German Democratic Republic, the visit of Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, to China, Korea, and Mongolia, and the mutual visits of parliamentary delegations between the Soviet Union and various European People's Democratic countries, etc., were all major events in the past year that further strengthened the fraternal friendship and cooperation among the people of the socialist camp. At the same time, countries have also expanded their mutual trade relations, scientific and technological cooperation, and cultural exchanges, especially the Soviet Union's assistance to many People's Democratic countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, which is of great significance for promoting the common economic and cultural upswing of the countries in the socialist camp. In the new Five-Year Plan starting next year, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will further strengthen socialist international cooperation in order to better explore the economic potential of each country and accelerate the economic development of the entire socialist camp.
    The countries of the socialist camp have also made new and extremely important contributions in maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation.
    Thanks to the concerted efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, international tensions have eased significantly in 1955. New facts further prove that the powerful socialist camp is a decisive factor in the development of the international situation. It has repeatedly frustrated the plans of imperialist aggressive forces, blocked the road to new wars, and made the international situation develop in a direction favorable to peace.
    When we look back on the past, the people of our socialist camp countries can be completely proud. In the past year, every page torn from the calendar and every revolution of the clock has recorded new achievements for us. But here, life is always moving forward relentlessly, and the past records, no matter how great and amazing, will eventually be replaced and updated by future records. Today, we not only welcome the coming year, but also plan for even more magnificent visions for the years and decades to come. We believe that, as Comrade Khrushchev said, under the current conditions, in the peaceful competition between the capitalist system and the socialist system, we will win, and socialism will win.

    社会主义和人民民主各国强大发展的一年
    程光锐　陈维
    历史的脚步即将跨进一九五六年。在迎接新年的时候，生活在社会主义大家庭中间的九亿自由欢乐的人民，怀着兴奋的心情回顾走过的道路，检阅一年来辛劳工作的成果。
    一九五五年，对于和平民主社会主义阵营来说是果实累累的一年。这个阵营的各国人民在维护和平、建设社会主义和共产主义的事业中获得了辉煌的胜利。
    过去一年是整个社会主义阵营的经济力量强大高涨的一年。
    苏联已经以四年零四个月的时间在今年五月一日以前提前完成了第五个五年计划的工业指标。第五个五年计划发展国民经济生产的任务正在超额地完成。根据初步统计，一九五五年苏联工业总产值比一九五四年增加了百分之十二。现在，苏联工业水平已达到战前一九四○年的百分之三百一十八。一九五五年苏联的生铁产量已达三千三百万吨以上，钢为四千五百万吨，煤为三亿九千万吨，石油为七千万吨。苏联重工业的强大发展，促进了苏联整个国民经济的高涨并加强了苏联的国防力量。
    电气化的飞速发展是苏联共产主义建设的重要特征之一。一九五五年苏联的电力生产将达到一千六百六十亿度，现在一昼夜的发电量就等于开始制定电气化计划的一九二○年全年的发电量！今年卡霍夫卡水电站和高尔基水电站和其他一些水电站已开始发电了，巨大的古比雪夫水电站也即将开始发电。世界上最大的水力工程——布拉次克水电站的建设工程的准备工作已经开始。这个水电站的发电量约等于古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站的发电量的总和。
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面所获得的成就，为生产的迅速发展开辟了新的广阔远景。
    苏联工业发展的速度之快是史无前例的。在近二十五年中（战争年代除外），苏联工业每年平均增加百分之十八点二，而同一时期美国的工业水平每年只增加百分之二点四，英国为百分之三点六，法国为百分之二点一。
    由于苏联人民努力执行苏联共产党中央委员会进一步发展农业的决议的结果，一九五五年苏联农业也有了显著的发展。原定开垦三千万公顷荒地的任务，已经提前一年零两个月完成了。播种面积比一九五○年扩大了百分之二十七。今年虽然气候条件不好，然而全年谷物总收获量仍然比去年高。
    一九五五年是我国实行第一个五年计划的第三年。许多工业部门都超额完成了生产任务，并正在拟定新的计划，争取提前一年完成五年计划。生产的迅速增长标志了我国社会主义工业化事业的长足发展。一九五五年全国工业的总产值将比一九五二年增加百分之六十二左右，三年中每年平均递增百分之十七点五。一九五五年，我国农村中出现的社会主义群众运动的高潮，是具有世界意义的大事情。现在已经可以断定，包括五亿人口的巨大规模半社会主义性质的农业合作化，在明年以内就可以实现。一九五五年我国全国粮食的产量达到一亿八千多万吨，棉花的产量达到一百四十多万吨，都创造了我国历史上的最高纪录。黄河综合利用的宏伟的计划预示着我国电气化事业的光辉的前途。我国工农业的迅速增长说明，六亿人民沿着光荣的社会主义道路前进的力量是何等巨大。
    一九五五年也是欧洲人民民主国家在建设社会主义的道路上继续大踏步迈进的一年。在这一年里，从东欧各国的工业生产战线上传来了许多令人兴奋的新的喜讯：波兰产钢量按人口平均计算约比战前增加三倍，捷克斯洛伐克完成了利用贫铁矿直接炼钢的世界创举，匈牙利全国最大的包尔绍德化学联合工厂投入生产，罗马尼亚的石油产量超过了一千万吨，保加利亚建成了全国第一个干船坞……。在从波罗的海到亚得里亚海畔的这一片土地上，一九五五年内出现了烟突林立的新的工厂，新的矿井，新的城市和高大的水坝。大批新的工业企业的投入生产，使欧洲人民民主国家的工业生产量比去年又有显著的增长，而等于战前的三倍半以上。由于工业的迅速发展，欧洲人民民主国家在整个欧洲经济中的工业生产中的比重已比一九四八年时提高了大约一倍。
    欧洲人民民主国家的农业在一九五五年也获得了新的成就。今年各国农业生产收获的丰盛，为十年来所未有。农业合作化事业有了新的进展。许多新的农业生产合作社成立起来，原有的也扩大了自己的成员。农业中的社会主义成分一般占有全国耕地的三分之一左右，而在捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚则分别超过了百分之四十和六十一。
    亚洲人民民主国家在发展经济文化方面也是成效卓著。在苏联和兄弟人民民主国家的合作下，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民迅速地恢复被战争毁坏的企业并建设新的工厂和矿山，今年，工业生产量已经超过了战前的水平。他们的努力加强了朝鲜的民主基地，有利于争取朝鲜和平统一的事业。在越南民主共和国，人民已经安居乐业。煤矿和纺织工业和各种手工业都已恢复生产，水利正在广泛兴修，农业也获得了丰收。越南民主共和国的稳定发展和巨大成就，吸引着南越广大人民的注意，使越南人民争取和平统一的力量得到加强。蒙古人民共和国在发展自己的畜牧业和工业方面也获得了新的成就。
    社会主义阵营经济力量的高涨进一步加强了这个阵营的威力。社会主义阵营各国每一分成就都给世界和平事业增添一分力量。
    一九五五年，苏联度过了它的光荣的三十八周年，欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家都以新的成就欢庆自己新生的纪念日。诞生了仅仅六年多的中华人民共和国，已发展成为世界和平和社会主义事业的一支强大力量。这一切成就证明社会主义制度的优越性。代表人类未来的社会主义思想，在一九五五年放射出了更加灿烂的光芒。
    一九五五年是社会主义阵营各国之间真诚合作和友好团结继续增进的一年。华沙条约的签订，苏联和德意志民主共和国关系条约的签订，越南民主共和国主席胡志明的访问苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的访问中国、朝鲜和蒙古，以及苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家议会代表团的互相访问等等，都是过去一年内进一步加强社会主义阵营各国人民的兄弟般友谊和合作的重大事件。同时，各国还扩大了它们相互之间的贸易关系，科学技术合作和文化交流，特别是苏联对许多人民民主国家在和平利用原子能方面的帮助，对于促进社会主义阵营各国经济和文化的共同高涨具有重大意义。在从明年开始的新的五年计划中，苏联和各人民民主国家将更进一步加强社会主义的国际合作，以便更好地发掘每一个国家的经济潜力，加速整个社会主义阵营经济的发展。
    在维护世界和平和增进国际合作方面，社会主义阵营各国也作出了新的极其重要的贡献。
    由于苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的一致努力和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，国际紧张局势在一九五五年有了显著的缓和。新的事实进一步证明：强大的社会主义阵营是国际局势发展中的一个决定性的因素，它一次又一次地挫败着帝国主义侵略势力的计划，堵塞着新战争的道路，使得国际局势朝着有利于和平的方向发展。
    当回顾已往的时候，我们社会主义阵营各国人民是完全可以自豪的。在过去的一年里，日历每撕去一页，时针每转动一圈，都为我们记录下新的成就。可是在我们这里，生活是永远不息地前进的，过去的纪录无论是多么伟大惊人，也终将被未来的纪录所代替和更新。今天我们不仅迎接即将来临的一年，而且也在规划着几年和几十年以后的更加宏伟的远景。我们相信，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，在目前的条件下，在资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的和平竞赛中，我们将得到胜利，社会主义将得到胜利。
