    Promptly Expose Counter-Revolutionary Elements' Sabotage of the Cooperative Movement
    Shi Xin
    The current agricultural cooperative movement has become the focal point of class struggle in the countryside. In some areas, a folk song is circulating among the peasants: "Poor peasants are riding the high tide, prosperous middle peasants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, landlords and rich peasants are playing tricks, and bad elements are spreading rumors." This folk song vividly illustrates the different attitudes of various classes of peasants towards the cooperative movement and profoundly reveals the acuteness and complexity of the class struggle in the high tide of cooperation. Faced with this serious class struggle, the task of the newspapers is to promptly expose the sabotage of the cooperative movement by counter-revolutionary elements, and to help the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants firmly grasp the powerful weapon of revolutionary vigilance to resolutely strike at the enemy's conspiracies, so that the cooperative movement can be carried out smoothly.
    In its propaganda on agricultural cooperation, Yunnan Daily attaches great importance to educating cadres and the masses in revolutionary vigilance. After Yunnan Province launched a large-scale movement to establish cooperatives this autumn, the newspaper not only selected typical cases such as the sabotage of the famous Xiaozhai Agricultural Cooperative by counter-revolutionary elements throughout the province for relatively concentrated and prominent publicity, but also paid attention to promptly exposing the enemy's sabotage crimes against the current movement. When counties held training classes for activists in establishing cooperatives, it exposed the fact that counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements, totaling forty-two people, had infiltrated the training class of more than eight hundred people held in Qujing County. After the work of establishing cooperatives was launched in various counties, it also exposed the fact that counter-revolutionary elements in Shangsuan Township, Jinning County, disguised themselves as activists and colluded with politically impure elements to demand the establishment of cooperatives; Jing Huiyu, a reactionary rich peasant in Liu Zongqi Township, Yuxi County, used petty favors to buy off Liu Guozhong, a member of the Communist Youth League branch, to obstruct the work of establishing cooperatives, and so on. While exposing these facts, Yunnan Daily also focused on analyzing the characteristics of the enemy's sabotage activities in the current situation, and demanded that rural cadres and peasants pay special attention to preventing counter-revolutionary elements from infiltrating the cooperative to carry out sabotage. For example, the newspaper pointed out in its commentaries on the examination of cooperative members and the selection of cooperative accountants that these tasks should be done with a clear class struggle perspective, and that counter-revolutionary elements and exploiting class elements must not be allowed to infiltrate the cooperative and occupy important positions such as accountants. This not only clearly told people that the current cooperative movement is not all smooth sailing, that there is enemy sabotage, and that there is a sharp class struggle, but also reminded people to pay attention to fighting the enemy from which aspects and in which links. Like the peasants of Longtan'ao Village, Liji'an Township, Chuxiong County, after studying the relevant reports and commentaries in the newspaper during the establishment of cooperatives, their eyes became bright, and they cleared out four bad elements when examining cooperative members.
    Henan Daily, Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, and other newspapers have also paid attention to this aspect of propaganda and education, using convincing examples to eliminate people's right-leaning paralysis. In an editorial, Henan Daily cited the following examples: Not long ago, a counter-revolutionary element in Houhe Village, Fengqiu County, openly smashed the Party branch secretary to death with a rice pounding mallet and injured the chairman of the township women's federation; all twenty-seven head of livestock in the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Hehe Township, Xinxiang County, were poisoned to death by counter-revolutionary elements overnight on October 22. With such shocking facts, the newspaper powerfully criticized the dangerous view held by some people that the enemy would not dare to sabotage during the high tide of cooperation, or that seeing some landlords and rich peasant elements pretending to be active, they would sincerely "support" socialism.
    The sabotage facts of the counter-revolutionary elements revealed by these newspapers, as well as the right-leaning paralysis ideas criticized by them, are not individual phenomena in individual regions. Local newspapers have the responsibility to use local examples, especially typical examples, to illustrate the current class struggle situation and characteristics, to educate the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants to maintain a clear head in the heated cooperative movement, to be vigilant and watch out for any sabotage conspiracies of the enemy, and to resolutely strike at them at any time. However, not all newspapers are paying attention to this point. Some newspapers only focus on reflecting the different attitudes of various classes within the peasants towards the cooperative movement and the ideological struggle between them, and rarely expose the resistance from the antagonistic classes, which does not fully reveal the entire picture of the class struggle surrounding the cooperative movement. Although some newspapers have also reported some cases of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the cooperative movement, they talk more about the past and less about the present, or even none at all. In order to better defend the agricultural cooperative movement, these newspapers should overcome the shortcomings in revealing the current rural class struggle and hold the weapon of revolutionary vigilance higher!

### 及时揭露反革命分子对合作化运动的破坏

    及时揭露反革命分子对合作化运动的破坏
    湜辛
    当前的农业合作化运动已经成为农村中阶级斗争的焦点。在有的地区的农民中流行着这样一首歌谣：“贫农搞高潮，富裕中农走着瞧，地主富农玩门道，坏蛋分子乱造谣。”这首歌谣不但生动地说明了农民中的各个阶层对合作化运动的不同态度，而且深刻地道出了合作化高潮中阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。在这个严重的阶级斗争面前，报纸的任务就是要及时地揭露反革命分子对合作化运动的破坏，帮助广大农村干部和农民群众紧紧掌握革命警惕性这个有力的武器，来坚决打击敌人的阴谋活动，使得合作化运动能够顺利地开展。
    云南日报在农业合作化的宣传中，很重视向干部群众进行革命警惕性的教育。这个报纸在今年秋季云南省展开大规模的建社运动以后，不只是选择了反革命分子破坏全省有名的小寨农业合作社等典型案件进行了比较集中突出的宣传，而且注意及时地揭露敌人对当前运动的破坏罪行。当各县举办办社积极分子训练班的时候，它就揭露了曲靖县举办的八百多人的训练班中混进了反革命分子和其他坏分子四十二人的事实。当各县建社工作展开后，它又揭露了晋宁县上蒜乡有反革命分子伪装积极，串连政治上不纯的分子要求办社；玉溪县刘总旗乡反动富农景惠玉用小恩小惠收买青年团支部委员刘国忠，阻碍建社工作等事实。云南日报在揭露这些事实的同时，还着重地分析了在目前形势下敌人破坏活动的特点，要求农村干部和农民群众特别注意防止反革命分子钻入合作社内部来实行破坏。例如，报纸在关于审查社员和选拔合作社会计人员的评论中都曾指出，应当以明确的阶级斗争观点来做好这些工作，绝不能让反革命分子和剥削阶级分子混入合作社，让他们窃踞像会计这样重要的职位。这就不仅清楚地告诉了人们当前的合作化运动并不是一帆风顺的，还有敌人的破坏，还有尖锐的阶级斗争；而且提醒了人们注意从哪些方面、在哪些环节上同敌人作斗争。像楚雄县李家庵乡龙潭凹村的农民，在建社中学习了报纸上有关的报道和评论后，眼睛就明亮起来，他们在审查社员的时候便清查出四名坏分子。
    河南日报、江苏新华日报等也注意了这一方面的宣传教育，它们用富有说服力的事例，来消除人们的右倾麻痹思想。河南日报在一篇社论中就援引了这样的事例：不久以前封邱县后河村一个反革命分子公然用捣米锤砸死了党支部书记，又砸伤了乡妇联会主席；新乡县合河乡第四农业合作社的二十七头牲口，在十月二十二日一夜之间全部被反革命分子毒死。报纸用这样惊心动魄的事实，有力地批判了某些人认为在合作化高潮中敌人不敢破坏，或者看到有些地主富农分子伪装积极便以为他们真心“拥护”社会主义的危险看法。
    像这些报纸所揭露的反革命分子的破坏事实，以及它们所批判的某些人的右倾麻痹思想，并不是个别地区的个别现象。各地报纸都有责任运用当地的事例，特别是典型的事例来说明当前的阶级斗争形势和特点，教育广大农村干部和农民群众在热火朝天的合作化运动中经常保持清醒的头脑，警惕地注视着敌人的任何破坏阴谋，并随时给以坚决的打击。但是目前并不是所有的报纸都注意到这一点。有的报纸只注重反映农民内部各个阶层对合作化运动的不同态度以及他们之间的思想斗争，而很少揭露来自敌对阶级的抵抗，这就没有完整地揭示出围绕着合作化运动的阶级斗争的全貌。有的报纸虽然也报道了一些反革命分子破坏合作化运动的案件，但却是谈过去的多，谈现在的少，甚至没有。为了更好地保卫农业合作化运动，这些报纸应当克服在揭示当前农村阶级斗争方面的缺点，把革命警惕性的武器举得更高些！
