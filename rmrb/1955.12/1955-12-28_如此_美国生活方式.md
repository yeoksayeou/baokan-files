    Such is the "American Way of Life"
    A recent shocking case in the United States of a son murdering his mother illustrates the unbelievable depths to which humanity can sink in today's "money-is-everything" society in America.

    John Graham was a twenty-three-year-old young man from Denver, Colorado, in the United States. He lost his father at a young age, and his mother had devoted a great deal of effort to raising him. But this young man, deeply influenced by the "American way of life," had his own philosophy of life. In his own words: "Anything can be done for money." Therefore, he did not think it unreasonable to take someone else's life, even his own mother's, to exchange for a large sum of money.

    Graham knew that his mother had more than $100,000 in assets, which would belong to him upon her death; and he knew that, in addition to this, he could receive $38,000 in life insurance compensation. So, he used the wisdom that American movies, television, and crime novels, which are filled with detailed descriptions of murder and robbery, had taught him, and planned an inhumane murder. His mother was going to Alaska from Denver on November 1st of this year to visit his sister. Graham diligently packed her luggage and took care of her boarding the plane, arranging everything. Shortly after the plane took off, it exploded in the air, and none of the more than forty passengers and crew members survived. It turned out that Graham had placed a package of explosives with a time-bomb mechanism in the suitcase his mother was carrying. When asked if he felt sad about killing so many people, Graham just shrugged.

    Like many crime news stories, Graham's murder was described in the American bourgeois press as an amusing anecdote, and Graham was portrayed as someone with some "strange ideas." But in fact, this is not an isolated or accidental event in the United States. The "American way of life" is to turn people into cold-blooded animals who can abandon all conscience in order to get rich. American monopoly capital, in order to facilitate its rule and carry out external aggression, has done a large-scale job of poisoning the minds of young people, to make millions of American youths accustomed to violence, bestiality, and sudden death. The surge in crime has become a major component of the "American way of life." Every day in the United States, there are thousands upon thousands of Grahams engaged in all sorts of criminal activities. FBI Director Hoover admitted not long ago that crime in the United States has reached such a level that one in every seventeen families will be a victim....

    And the likes of Radford are recently clamoring to promote this "best way of life in the world today" to the whole world!

### 如此“美国生活方式”

    如此“美国生活方式”
    最近在美国发生的一件骇人听闻的儿子谋杀母亲案，说明了在美国今天的“金元至上”的社会里，人性可以堕落到怎样令人难以相信的地步。
    约翰·格拉哈姆是美国柯罗拉多州丹佛镇一个二十三岁的青年。他自幼丧父，他的母亲为了养育他费了很大心血。但是这个深受“美国生活方式”薰陶的青年却有自己的人生哲学。按他自己的说法：“为了金钱什么都可以干”。因此他认为拿别人的生命以至他自己的母亲的生命来换取一笔巨款并不是什么不合情理的事情。
    格拉哈姆知道他母亲有十万美元以上的财产，只要他母亲死去，这笔财产就属于他的了；而且他知道，除此以外，他还可以拿到三万八千美元的人寿保险赔偿费。于是他就运用那充满关于杀人越货勾当的详细描写的美国电影、电视和犯罪小说教给他的智慧，布置了一桩灭绝人性的谋杀案。他母亲今年十一月一日从丹佛到阿拉斯加去探望他的姊姊，格拉哈姆殷勤地替他母亲收拾行李，并且照顾她坐上飞机，安顿一切。飞机起飞后不久就在空中爆炸，乘客和飞行人员四十多人无一幸免。原来格拉哈姆在他母亲携带的衣箱里放进了一包装有定时爆炸机件的炸药。当别人问到他杀害了这么多人感不感到难过时，格拉哈姆只耸了一耸肩膀。
    像许多犯罪消息一样，格拉哈姆谋杀事件在美国资产阶级报刊上被作为一件趣闻加以描写，格拉哈姆被说成是一个有着一些“古怪念头”的人。但是事实上这在美国并不是个别和偶然的事情。“美国生活方式”就是要把人变成为冷酷无情的动物，为了发财致富，可以丧尽天良。美国垄断资本为了便利它的统治和对外进行侵略，作了规模巨大的工作来毒害青年的思想，要使千百万美国青年习惯于暴行，兽性和突然死亡。犯罪激增已成为“美国生活方式”的一个主要内容。每天在美国有着成千上万的格拉哈姆在干着各种各样犯罪的勾当。美国联邦调查局局长胡佛不久以前承认：美国犯罪已经达到这样的程度，以至每十七家人中就将有一家是受害者……。
    而雷德福之流最近却在叫嚷要把这种“当今世界中最好的一种生活方式”向全世界推广！
