Can Facts Be Obliterated?
Xiaobai Yushuang

I just returned to Beijing from a tour in the Xuanhua area, and I don't know much about the vigorous anti-rightist struggle in the capital. Moreover, I couldn't read the newspapers in time while I was away, so I didn't get to see many rightist opinions in time. Obviously, I'm a step behind my comrades in the anti-rightist struggle. When I saw those reactionary opinions in the newspaper for the first time, I was so angry that I couldn't sleep all night. I couldn't wait to rush to Beijing and settle accounts with these rightists who were talking against their conscience. Although I am not highly educated and cannot write articles, I still want to speak my mind and let them see whether achievements are the main thing or shortcomings are the main thing.

The rightists say: "The lives of Party cadres have improved, while the lives of the common people have declined compared to before liberation." Some people also say: "The Communist Party has messed things up." Then let's look at the living facts. This time, I performed at the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua and visited their construction site, sanatorium, and workers' dormitories, and had individual conversations with many workers. According to them: In the old society, not to mention the suffering of doing this kind of work, even life was difficult to guarantee. Most of the workers were forced to come with guns; they would die whether they worked or not. The factory did not care about the workers' lives. Due to the lack of necessary equipment in the tunnels, most of the workers suffered from occupational diseases (i.e., silicosis). Those who died in the tunnels were thrown into mass graves like dead dogs. "Thinking of those inhuman lives, I still feel terrified today. Let's look at the lives of our workers after liberation. Not only is life guaranteed, but social status and living standards have also greatly improved. We have become the masters of the country and can participate in national affairs. No one calls us 'black devils' anymore. The People's Government has improved production conditions for us. Before liberation, drilling holes with wind drills caused a lot of dust to fly into the workers' lungs. After liberation, the latest water pump drills were used, which reduced dust. There are sun lamps outside the cave, and ventilation devices inside. The occupational diseases that have been circulating for many years have been basically eliminated. Most of the more than forty old workers currently living in the sanatorium have diseases brought from the old society."

Let's look at their living conditions! In addition to their wages, each person receives two haircut coupons per month. This expense alone costs the entire mine 16,000 yuan per year. The factory built beautiful bathhouses for them, where they can take a bath every day after work, free of charge. "After taking a bath in this comfortable bathhouse, putting on our own material clothes, leather shoes, and wearing a watch, we look just like college students."

One worker said with a sad tone: "In the old society, our family had been workers for generations and didn't know a single word. Today, my child is actually in middle school, which was something I could never have dreamed of in the old society. I also want to tell you a few things. Our workers go down into the tunnels for four hours a day. When we come up to rest, we are given health pastries, and each person gets two cod liver oil pills a day. The labor protection fee for our factory alone is 833,999 yuan per year. Family subsidies are 100,000 yuan, and welfare expenses are 1,073,790 yuan. The mine has five movie projectors to show us movies. In addition, we have also organized our own amateur troupe, with Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Jin Opera..." The benefits are countless. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would we be today?"

Rightist elements who speak against their conscience! Open your eyes and take a look. Are these living facts as you said, that the Communist Party has messed things up? Are achievements secondary?

Now I want to talk about some issues related to drama. I feel that the rightist viewpoints and right-leaning thoughts in our drama circles cannot but arouse our vigilance. For example, in Wu Zuguang's article "On the Leadership of Drama Work" published in the 11th issue of Drama News, he said that drama work has not only not been done well in the years since liberation, but has been messed up. All of this is caused by the leadership of the Party. He said that few of the active and accomplished actors on the drama stage today were trained in the eight years since liberation. Let's not talk about others. Take myself, for example. Yes, I had some fame before liberation. But comparing the past me with the present me, there is a world of difference. In the old society, I couldn't read a few words, and even writing my own name looked like worms crawling. When performing, I sang many lines without understanding them, and I couldn't even talk about analyzing the characters. There was no director to rehearse the play. Two people talked about it and went on stage. If I forgot the words, I would randomly make up "water words" on stage. If the play was long, I could shorten it at will, which is called "Ma Qian Dian" (shortening before the horse). If the play was short, I could lengthen it at will, which is called "Ma Hou Dian" (lengthening after the horse). The artistic quality at that time can be imagined. In the eight years since liberation, I have had the opportunity to go to school, and now I am in junior high school and can write ordinary letters. My political consciousness has also improved. Therefore, I have the ability to analyze scripts and characters' thoughts, and I have a preliminary understanding of how to direct a play. We go to construction sites and the front lines to perform, and we have the opportunity to experience the lives of the people. We have a source of life in creating characters, so the artistic quality is greatly improved compared to before liberation. Take the play "Qin Xianglian" as an example. It has been performed for many years before liberation, passed down from generation to generation, always the same, with no improvement. But today, under the leadership of the Party, we are equipped with directors, writers, musicians, and artists, which allows us to learn a lot of new things. Aren't all these achievements obtained through the Party's vigorous cultivation and care after liberation? Furthermore, the training of an actor is not an easy task. I started performing on stage at the age of six or seven, and I have a history of more than twenty years before liberation. Even planting a tree cannot grow into a big tree in seven or eight years, let alone training an actor. How can you expect to train an actor like Mei Lanfang in seven or eight years?

Wu Zuguang's view on the repertoire is: "In recent years, the classical opera, which has tens of thousands of plays, has been squeezed to the point where only a few plays are struggling to survive on the stage. This kind of slashing and killing is really admirable. Failing to accomplish anything, but ruining everything, this is a true portrayal of these drama reform cadres."

I think this statement is extremely one-sided. Chinese opera has a long history and has left behind a large number of excellent repertoires. However, due to the lack of attention to the creativity of the people in the old society, many repertoires have been lost. After liberation, due to the Party's emphasis on national heritage and the call for a large number of literary and art cadres to help with drama reform work, more than 58,000 plays have been excavated in terms of repertoire. More than 1,000 excellent plays were discovered. More than 1,000 cadres participated in the reorganization of the repertoire. There are hundreds of repertoires that are popular among the masses. For example, Liu Qiao'er, Xianglin's Wife, Qin Xianglian, The Story of the West Chamber, Little Son-in-Law, Legend of the White Snake, Li Ersao's Remarriage, Yang Sanjie's Accusation, Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage... etc. Some have been performed more than 1,000 times. Also, some opera genres such as Kunqu Opera and Hebei Silk String Opera were almost lost, but, under the care of the Party, they have been reborn on the stage today and are loved by the people of the whole country. Aren't these amazing achievements relying on the leadership of the Party? Why does Wu Zuguang say that it is "failing to accomplish anything but ruining everything"?

He also said: "Today, the leaders of countless art groups just don't consider the needs of the people, and think that the masses are ignorant. They use countless rules and regulations to kill everything that the masses like, and 'stuff' the masses with things that the masses don't like as a way to educate the masses." Is this true? Let's look at the situation of the audience buying tickets! Some people carry quilts and queue up at night to buy two tickets. Is this something that the leaders stuffed them to watch? Whenever a new play is performed, the theater receives a large number of letters from the masses. The theater has always attached importance to the letters from the masses, and many good opinions from the masses have been adopted by the directors. Can it be said that the masses do not care about or like these repertoires? Can it be said that they are being forced to watch them? If Comrade Wu Zuguang could go deep into the masses and listen to their reactions, he would not be so subjective and one-sided.

In addition, Wu Zuguang also believes that the leaders of opera are all laymen, and laymen cannot lead professionals. He completely opposes the organization and the individual. Therefore, according to his statement, he is attempting to abolish the leadership of the Party. In the eight years since liberation, the drama industry has been developing vigorously. Is it possible without the leadership of the Party? Who has greatly increased the enthusiasm of artists? Who pointed out the direction of artistic development? Who told us to be one with the people and serve the people wholeheartedly? Who promoted the development of art? Take our China Ping Opera Theater as an example. Without the specific leadership of the Party in ideological, professional, and organizational aspects, if we were to do it entirely by ourselves, I really don't know what it would become. I firmly oppose the idea of reversing the car. If anyone wants to pull us back to the old road of private troupes in the old society, I would rather not do drama work. It was the Party that gave Ping Opera youth, and today the Ping Opera genre has developed into a national genre. Whoever wants to separate the drama industry from the leadership of the Party is a sinner of drama. No matter what kind of provocation, it cannot shake the hearts of our opera workers who rely on the organization. I don't know any theoretical criticism, I just wrote down my personal experiences to make a comparison between the new and old societies. Let those with rightist views think carefully about what the purpose of their erroneous remarks that distort and deny the Party is? What is the root of their thoughts? Now is the time to sincerely confess to the people, otherwise the people will never agree.

    事实抹杀得了吗？
    小白玉霜
    我刚从宣化一带巡回演出回到北京，对首都轰轰烈烈反右派斗争的情况不太了解，又加上在外不能及时看到报纸，许多右派言论没能及时看到，显然在反右派斗争中我比同志们落后了一步。当我在报上第一次看到那些反动言论时，气的我一夜也没有睡好，恨不得马上赶到北京和这些眜着良心说话的右派分子来算算账。我虽然文化不高，不会写文章，但我还是要把心里话说出来，让他们看看究竟成绩是主要的还是缺点是主要的。
    右派分子说：“党员干部的生活都提高了，而老百姓的生活比解放前降低了”。还有人说：“共产党把事情都搞糟了”。那就让我们看看活生生的事实吧。这次我在宣化龙烟铁矿演出，参观了他们的工地、疗养院、工人宿舍，并且和许多工人进行了个别谈话。据他们说：在旧社会里，干这一行工的受苦不说，就是连性命也难保。大多数的工人都是用枪杆子逼着来的，干也是死，不干也得亡。厂方不管工人的死活，由于坑道里缺乏应有的设备，大部分工人都得了职业病（即矽肺病）。死在坑道里把我们当死狗一样的扔到了万人坑。“想起这些不是人的生活，今天还觉得毛骨悚然。再看看解放后我们工人的生活。不但生命有了保障，社会地位和生活也大大提高了。我们做了国家的主人，可以参与国家大事，再也没有人叫我们‘黑鬼’了。人民政府为我们改进了生产条件，解放前用风钻钻洞，很多尘土都飞到工人的肺里。解放后换用最新式的水泵风钻，这样就可以减少尘土。洞的外面设有太阳灯，洞里有通风器。把过去多少年来流传着的职业病基本上消灭了。目前在疗养院住的四十多位老工人，他们的病大部分都是从旧社会带来的。”
    再看看他们的生活待遇吧！除了工资外，每人每月发理发票两张。仅这笔开支，全矿工人一年就需要一万六千元。厂里为他们修建了漂亮的洗澡室，每天工作完了都可以洗澡，而且不收费。“在这舒适的洗澡室中洗过澡换上了自己的料子衣服，大皮鞋一穿，手表一带，真好像大学生一样。”
    有一个工人同志带着心酸的口吻说：“在旧社会，我们一家几辈子都是传代工人，也不认识一个字，今天我的孩子居然上了中学，在旧社会里真是做梦也想不到的事。另外我还要说几件事给你们听听。我们工人每天下坑道四小时，上来休息的时候发给我们保健糕点，每人每日鱼肝油丸两粒。光我们这一个厂劳动保护费一年就用八十三万三千九百九十九元。家属补助费十万元，福利费一百零七万三千七百九十元。矿上有电影机五部为我们放电影。另外我们自己还组织业余剧团，有京戏、评戏、晋剧……”。这些好处真是数不胜数。要不是共产党、毛主席，我们那儿会有今天”。
    眜着良心说瞎话的右派分子！你们睁开眼看一看，这些活生生的事实，是像你们所说的共产党把事情搞糟了吗？成绩是次要的吗？
    下面我想谈谈有关戏剧方面的一些问题。我觉得，右派观点和右倾思想在我们戏剧界的表现，不能不引起我们的警惕。例如最近吴祖光在戏剧报11期发表的“谈戏剧工作的领导问题”一文，说解放几年来戏曲工作不但没有搞好，而是搞糟了。这一切都是党的领导造成的。他说目前戏剧舞台上那些活跃着的，有成就的演员，没有几个是解放八年培养出来的。且不谈别人。就拿我自己来说，不错，解放前我是已有了些名声。可是过去的我和今天的我相比较，那真是有天渊之别。在旧社会里，我识不得几个字，连写自己的名字都像虫爬似的。演戏时很多句词不懂就唱了，对人物分析就更谈不上啦。没有导演排戏，两人说说就上戏。忘了词就在台上乱编“水词”。戏长了可以随便减短，行话叫“马前点”。戏短了可以随便拉长叫做“马后点”。当时的艺术质量可想而知。解放八年来，我有机会上了学，现在已读初中，能写普通的信。政治觉悟也提高了。因此，也就有能力分析剧本和人物思想，初步懂得怎样排戏了。我们到工地、前线去演出，有机会体验人民的生活，在创造人物上有了生活的源泉，因此艺术质量比解放前大大提高了。就拿“秦香莲”一剧来说，解放前演了多少年，一代传一代，老是那样，没有什么提高。而今天在党的领导下，为我们配备了导演、文学家、音乐工作者、美术家，使我们学习了不少新东西。所有这些成绩，不都是解放后党的大力培养和关怀才获得的吗？再说，一个演员的培养，也不是那么容易的事。我从六、七岁就上台演戏，到解放前也有二十多年的历史了。就是栽一棵树吧，也不是七、八年就能长成大树的，何况是培养一个演员呢？怎能要求在七、八年内就培养出像梅兰芳那样的演员出来呢？
    吴祖光对剧目的看法是：“这些年来把拥有几万出戏的古典戏曲生生挤兑得只剩了寥寥几出戏在舞台上苟延残喘，这种大杀大砍的手段真是令人惊佩。成事不足，败事有余，真是这些戏改干部的写照”。
    我觉得这种说法真是片面性到了极点。我国戏曲有着悠久的历史，流传下了大量的优秀剧目。但由于在旧社会不重视人民的创造，很多剧目都失传了。解放后由于党重视民族遗产，号召大批文艺干部下团帮助戏改工作，就剧目来说，就挖掘了五万八千多个戏。发掘一千多个优秀剧目。参加剧目整理的干部有一千多人。受群众欢迎的剧目有几百出。如刘巧儿、祥林嫂、秦香莲、西厢记、小女婿、白蛇传、李二嫂改嫁、杨三姐告状、杨乃武与小白菜……等。有的演出多至一千多场。又如有些剧种如昆曲、河北丝弦等，几乎要失传了，但，在党的关怀下，今天在舞台上又新生了，并且受到全国人民的爱戴。这些惊人的成绩，难道不是依靠党的领导吗？为什么吴祖光却说是“成事不足败事有余”呢？
    他又说：“今天无数的艺术团体的领导，偏偏就从不估计人民群众的需要，认为群众浑噩无知。对群众喜爱的东西，用无数清规戒律斩尽杀绝，把群众不喜爱的东西‘塞’给群众作为对群众进行教育”。是这样吗？我们看看观众买票的情况吧！有的人为了买两张票抗着被子夜里去排队，这难道是领导上塞给他们去看的吗？每当演出一个新戏，都会接到群众大批来信，剧院对群众的来信从来都是重视的，群众有很多好的意见都被导演们采纳了，这能说群众不关心不喜爱这些剧目吗？能说是硬“塞”给观众看的吗？假使吴祖光同志能够深入群众听听他们的反映，也就不会如此的主观片面了。
    另外吴祖光还认为戏曲的领导都是些外行，外行不能领导内行。把组织和个人完全对立起来看。因此按他的说法，就是企图想取消党的领导。解放八年来，戏剧事业蓬蓬勃勃的发展，没有党的领导是可能的吗？是谁使得艺术家的工作积极性大大提高了？是谁指出了艺术的发展方向？是谁告诉我们要和人民打成一片，全心全意为人民服务？是谁推动了艺术的发展？就拿我们中国评剧院来说，如果没有党在思想方面、业务方面、组织方面的具体领导，完全是由我们自己来搞，那真不知要搞成什么样子。我坚决反对开倒车的思想，谁要是再把我们拉回旧社会的私营班社的老道路上去，我宁愿不干戏剧工作了。是党给了评剧以青春，今天评剧剧种已发展成了全国性的剧种。谁要想使戏剧事业脱离党的领导，谁就是戏剧的罪人。无论什么样的挑拨离间，也不能丝毫动摇我们戏曲工作者依靠组织的心。我不会什么理论批判，只是把我个人的亲身体会写出来作一新旧社会的对比。让那些有右派观点的人好好想想，他们提出的那些歪曲党否定党的错误言论究竟目的何在？他们的思想根源又是什么？现在是该诚心向人民交代的时候了，否则人民是绝对不会答应的。
