Rightist Listeners!
Farmers Will Not Be Fooled By You
Written Statement by Li You'an

I have listened to the reports of the responsible comrades at the conference and express my complete support. Now, I will report on the actual situation of the Shuangqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province.

Our cooperative has been established for six years. Since the end of 1951, it has been developed conditionally, following the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions, after being formed by merging seven mutual aid groups into a small cooperative of forty-three households. This year, it has become a large cooperative with more than five thousand households, and individual farmers within the scope of the large cooperative have joined the cooperative. "Taking the cooperative as home" is the common aspiration of the cooperative members.

Our cooperative is located in the Jiangnan region, a rice-producing area with mountains and rivers. Since liberation, due to the rapid change of the backwardness of the old countryside, especially the superiority of the new rural areas organized for agricultural production, grain output has increased year by year. Taking 1952 as an example, the small cooperative had 367 mu of rice fields, with an average annual output of 908 jin, an increase of more than 20% compared with the early days of liberation. After the large cooperative was established in 1956, although it suffered a series of natural disasters such as drought, floods, and typhoons, the annual rice output was still about 40% higher than that of the ten individual farmer households such as Gong Jingyuan. For example, in the Victory Small Embankment, when there was a flood in 1954, a total of 70,000 jin of grain was harvested. In 1956, the flood was even greater than in 1954, but more than 400,000 jin of grain was harvested.

The cooperative members know that these benefits come from the leadership and strong support of the Communist Party of China. To be more specific, for example, in terms of water conservancy construction, after the large cooperative was established, the government immediately invested in the establishment of a self-flowing irrigation station. At the same time, 57 culverts and sluices were newly built, the Shuangqiao Dam, which covers an area of about 50 li, was newly built, and a new river of 14 li and a flood discharge ditch of 14 li were opened. The cooperative members said, "The dam water flows in a winding path, and good rice grows on the flat land; the Communist Party has come, and the water is also benefiting us." Yes, since the completion of the self-flowing irrigation station in our cooperative, it has not only reduced the physical labor of the cooperative members, but also generated electricity, installed more than 2,000 light bulbs, and the entire cooperative is brightly lit at night. The cooperative members said, "Now we really don't need oil to light the lamps! Look! The good days are yet to come!"

In terms of production technology reform, the cooperative members are even more hardworking. In recent years, our cooperative has followed the spirit of "three reforms," referring to the local past experience in increasing production, and formulating annual production increase plans and practical production increase methods. Taking double-cropping rice as an example, although there was a major disaster last year, the annual yield of double-cropping rice was still more than 150 jin higher than that of single-cropping medium rice. This year, the entire cooperative plans to plant more than 15,000 mu of double-cropping rice. According to the current water conservancy conditions, it is certain that each mu of double-cropping rice will yield at least 200 jin more than single-cropping medium rice.

But strangely, there are still a small group of people who are talking nonsense with their eyes open, saying that "the farmers' emotions are depressed" and that "they don't want the leadership of the Communist Party." I don't understand what they mean? Can the cooperative be run well and production be improved without relying on the enthusiasm of the masses of farmers? As for the shortcomings in the work and the individual cadres' style is not good enough, these can be improved at any time, not as these people say that they cannot be seen. Although our farmers do not have a high level of education at present, we can still distinguish between right and wrong. However, these people do not want to really listen to our farmers' opinions. I want to tell these nonsense people that we farmers will not be deceived. We will resolutely fight against those who oppose the Communist Party and oppose us taking the bright road of socialism.

### 右派分子听者！  农民决不会受你们的骗  李有安的书面发言

    右派分子听者！
    农民决不会受你们的骗
    李有安的书面发言
    我听了大会上各位负责同志的报告，表示完全拥护。现在，就我们安徽省宣城县双桥农业社的实际情况，向大会汇报一下。
    我社建成已经六年了，自一九五一年底，由七个互助组合并组成四十三户的小社以后，并切实地遵照着党中央的指示精神，而有条件的进行了发展工作。今年已成为五千多户的大社，目前大社范围内的个体农民都参加了合作社。“以社为家”已是社员们的共同愿望。
    我社是地处江南、有山有水的产稻地区。自解放以来，由于很快的改变了旧农村的落后，特别是发挥了新农村组织起来进行农业生产的优越性，粮食产量年年都有增加。就拿一九五二年来说，小社有三百六十七亩水稻，每年平均产量九百零八斤，比解放初期增产二成多。一九五六年大社办成后，虽然一连串的遭受了旱、涝、洪水、台风等自然灾害，水稻每年产量仍比当地个体农民宫景元等十户，多产粮食在四成上下。又如胜利小圩，一九五四年闹水灾时，共收粮食七万斤，一九五六年水灾还大于一九五四年，而收粮食达四十万多斤。
    这些好处的由来，社员们都知道，这是在中国共产党的领导和大力支持下得来的。再具体一点说，例如：我社在兴修水利方面，自大社办成之后，紧接着即由政府投资，建立了自流灌溉站。同时，新建了五十七处涵闸，新造了约五十华里方圆的双桥大塘，开了十四华里的新河和十四华里长的排洪沟。社员们说：“坝水曲曲道，平地长好稻；共产党来了，水也为我们造福了。”是的，我社自从自流灌溉站建成后，不光是减轻了社员们的体力劳动，还发出了电，装上二千多个电灯头，晚上全社照的通亮。社员们说：“现在真的点灯不用油了，瞧吧！好日子还在后头呢！”
    在生产技术改革方面，社员们更是努力的。近几年来，我社即本着“三改”精神，参照本地过去的增产经验，逐年制订增产计划和切实可行的增产办法。就以双季稻来讲，去年虽有大灾，但每年双季稻比一季中稻还增产一百五十余斤。今年全社计划种双季稻一万五千余亩，按现在水利条件看，每亩双季稻比一季中稻最少增产二百多斤是有把握的。
    可是奇怪的很，现在还有一小伙人，在那里睁着眼说瞎话，说什么“农民情绪消沉了”，又是什么“不要共产党的领导了”。我不了解是指的什么？难道以上事实不是依靠了农民群众的积极性，就能把社办好吗？就能把生产搞好吗？至于说到工作中还有缺点，个别干部作风还不够好，这些都是能够随时改进的，不是像这些人说的那样不能见人。我们农民目前虽然文化还不高，是黑是白还是能分得清楚。可是，这些人就不想真正听听我们农民的意见。我要告诉这些胡说八道的人们，我们农民们是不会受骗的。那个反对共产党，反对我们走社会主义的光明大道，我们将和他进行坚决的斗争。
