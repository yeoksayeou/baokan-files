*Wenhui Bao* Beijing Office Exposes Pu Xixiu as a Double-Dealer Harboring Hostility

(Our report) The Beijing office of *Wenhui Bao* continued its meetings yesterday to expose the anti-socialist and anti-people words and deeds of rightist Pu Xixiu, as well as the role she played in the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Pu Xixiu harbored hostility towards the Party, and she also sowed discord between the Party and the masses in order to weaken the Party's prestige. Mei Duo said: Pu Xixiu slandered the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee in front of her comrades. She often said that the dogmatism of the Central Propaganda Department was the most serious. Some manuscripts were requested from the Central Propaganda Department, and before she had even read them carefully, she said that they were dogmatic and dry.

Ye Gang said: After the *People's Daily* editorial department criticized our newspaper, how did Pu Xixiu view this fact? She said that Xu Zhucheng should not have been the head of the delegation on this trip abroad, he was not humble enough, which caused the Party to be dissatisfied with *Wenhui Bao*. In her opinion, the Party was hypocritical in its dealings with people and things.

Yang Chongye said: Pu Xixiu had two completely different attitudes towards the Party and the League. In the Democratic League group meetings, she said that she loved the Democratic League very much, believing that it gave her great education and help; but she did not feel this way about the Party. She herself asked to join the Party, and when the Party organization asked her to write an autobiography, she declared to her comrades that the Party organization repeatedly asked her to join the Party, but she herself found writing an autobiography troublesome, saying "After joining the Party, there will be one more set of meetings." This is how Pu Xixiu played a double game.

At the meeting, comrades were very angry about the report that Zhang Bojun had confessed that Pu Xixiu had reported some business activities to Zhang Bojun. Everyone was furious and demanded that Pu Xixiu confess whether she had also reported some internal information obtained by reporters to the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Everyone angrily denounced Pu Xixiu for refusing to confess the details of her participation in the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy activities until today, only producing a few letters from Luo to her as a perfunctory gesture. She always said that she couldn't remember, and then asked others to help her remember, to give her clues, trying to muddle through.

Lü Derun revealed that Pu Xixiu once said that she had seen Luo Longji's speech on intellectuals at the CPPCC meeting being written four or five times, and she had also offered suggestions for revision. This alone can illustrate the relationship between them.

Xie Weiming revealed that around 1951, Luo once invited Zhang Dongsun and others to have a closed-door secret talk in Pu's room, which proves that Pu participated in Luo Longji's small group's political activities, but she has been resisting confessing.

Comrades talked about how rightists used *Wenhui Bao* as a tool against the Party, against the people, and against socialism, and that we were actually trapped in the rightists' net. Looking back today, we are extremely saddened, so everyone feels boundless hatred for the rightists.

### 文汇报北京办事处揭露  浦熙修是心怀敌意的两面派

    文汇报北京办事处揭露
    浦熙修是心怀敌意的两面派
    本报讯　文汇报北京办事处昨日继续开会揭露右派分子浦熙修反社会主义、反人民的言行，以及她在章罗联盟中所起的作用。
    浦熙修对党是怀着敌意的，她还挑拨党群关系，以削弱党的威信。梅朵说：浦熙修在同志们的面前诬蔑中宣部，她常说中宣部的教条主义最严重。有的从中宣部约来的稿子，她还没很好的看，就说这是教条主义的东西，枯燥乏味。
    叶冈说：人民日报编辑部对本报提出批评后，浦熙修怎样看待这个事实呢？她说，徐铸成这次出国不应该当团长，没有谦让，因此使得党对文汇报不满。在她看来，党对人对事都是虚伪的。
    杨重野说：浦熙修对党和对盟抱着两种截然不同的态度。她在民盟小组会上说，她非常爱民盟这个团体，认为给她很大教育和帮助；而她对党却不是这样，她自己要求入党，党组织要她写自传，她却向同志们宣称说，党组织一再拉她入党，而她自己是嫌写自传麻烦，“入党以后又多一套会议”。浦熙修就是这样耍两面手法。
    会上同志们对于报载章伯钧的交代中提到浦熙修曾把一些业务活动汇报给章伯钧了，大家非常愤怒，要浦熙修交代出她是否把记者采访到的一些内部情况也汇报给章罗联盟了。
    大家非常愤怒地指斥浦熙修一直到今天还不肯把她参与章罗联盟的阴谋活动交代出来，只拿出罗给她的几封信来搪塞，她总说想不起来，再就是要别人帮她想，提提线索，想蒙混过关。
    吕德润揭露，浦熙修曾经说过，罗隆基在政协会议上关于知识分子的发言，她见他写过四五次，她还提出过修改意见，这一点就可以说明他们之间的关系。
    谢蔚明揭露，大约1951年，有一次罗曾约张东荪等在浦的房间内关门秘谈，可证浦是参与罗隆基小集团的政治活动的，但她却一直抗拒不肯交代。
    同志们谈到右派分子利用文汇报作为反党、反人民、反社会主义的工具，而我们实际上陷在右派的网罗中，今天回过头来看，万分痛心，因此大家对右派分子更感到无比的痛恨。
