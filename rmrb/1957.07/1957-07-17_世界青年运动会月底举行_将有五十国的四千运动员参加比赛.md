　　Moscow, July 16th (from our correspondent) - The Third World Youth Friendship Games will be held in Moscow from July 29th to August 10th. On the 15th, the Chairman of the Soviet Olympic Committee, Andrianov, said at a press conference that the scale of the Third World Youth Friendship Games exceeds the previous two. To date, four thousand athletes from fifty countries will participate.

　　At this Games, there will be twenty-three men's competitions and fourteen women's competitions. Finland, France, Egypt, China, Bulgaria, Poland and other countries have sent large delegations. Britain will participate in twelve events, with a delegation of one hundred and thirty-seven people. Yugoslavia will send one hundred and twenty athletes to Moscow. The Soviet delegation has five hundred people, who will participate in twenty events.

　　Although the Third World Youth Friendship Games is held at the same time and place as the Sixth World Youth Festival, it is completely independent in its organization. When the decision was made to hold the Games, many international sports organizations expressed their support and agreement. Many leaders of international sports organizations accepted the invitation of the Organizing Committee of the Third World Youth Friendship Games, and one hundred and forty-five international referees will participate in the conference work, including the Chairman of the International Volleyball Federation, Mr. Liber (France), the Chairman of the Table Tennis Federation, Mr. Montagu (UK), and the Chairman of the Athletics Federation, Mr. Nabel (Finland), etc. Many international athletes and winners of the Sixteenth World Games will participate in the competition.

　　Now the preparations for the conference are ready. Foreign representatives will live in the dormitory of Moscow University on Lenin Hills, which has been freshly painted. The first batch of representatives has arrived in Moscow. More athletes could have participated in this Games, but some countries have obstructed athletes from participating, for example, the US State Department has banned athletes from leaving the country. Therefore, only one table tennis team currently in Europe from the United States is participating.

    世界青年运动会月底举行
    将有五十国的四千运动员参加比赛
    本报莫斯科16日电　第三届世界青年友谊运动会即将在7月29日到8月10日在莫斯科举行。15日苏联奥林匹克委员会主席安德里阿诺夫在记者招待会上说，这次第三届世界青年友谊运动会在规模上超过了前两次。到目前为止，有五十个国家的四千运动员将参加。
    在这次运动会上将举行二十三项男子比赛，十四项女子比赛。芬兰、法国、埃及、中国、保加利亚、波兰等国都派出了人数众多的代表团。英国将参加十二种比赛，代表团由一百三十七人组成。南斯拉夫将派出一百二十个运动员到莫斯科。苏联的代表团有五百人，他们将参加二十种比赛。
    这次第三届世界青年友谊运动会虽然与第六届世界青年联欢节在同时同地举行，但是在组织上它是完全独立的。在决定举行这次运动会时，许多国际体育组织都表示支持和同意。许多国际体育组织的领导人接受了第三届世界青年友谊运动会筹备委员会的邀请，有一百四十五位国际级裁判员将参加大会工作，其中包括国际排球联合会主席理伯（法国）、乒乓球联合会主席孟太鸠（英国）、田径赛联合会主席纳贝尔（芬兰）等。许多国际体育选手、十六届世界运动会得奖者将参加大会比赛。
    现在大会的准备工作已经就绪，外国代表将住在列宁山上莫斯科大学的宿舍里，那里已经粉刷一新。第一批代表已经来到了莫斯科。参加此次运动会的运动员本来可以更多一些，可是某些国家却阻挠运动员参加这次运动会，例如美国国务院就禁止运动员出境，因此美国只有一个现在欧洲的乒乓球队参加。
