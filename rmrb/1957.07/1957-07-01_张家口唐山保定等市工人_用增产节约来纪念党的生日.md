Baoding, July 30th (This newspaper) Workers in cities like Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Baoding are all celebrating the Party's birthday, "July 1st," with achievements in increased production and thrift. The machinery workshop of the Zhangjiakou Prospecting Plant had over a dozen B-type small Dongbei lathes, which often broke down in the past. Each repair would take at least twenty hours, seriously affecting the completion of the workshop's production tasks. Sun Honggen, a young member of the repair team, after much research, came up with the idea of adding a pulley sleeve to the joint, which allowed the lathe to be repaired in just two hours. The gift from the Kailuan Coal Mine workers to the Party's birthday was an extra 12,200 tons of coal produced from June 1st to 23rd by the entire mine. With this, the entire mine has completed the state plan for the first half of this year ahead of schedule. The plasterers at the Tangshan Power Plant workers' dormitory construction site changed their plastering methods, improved the quality of their work, and eliminated uneven surfaces. The Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, having fully completed its production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule on the 20th of this month, will repair six more locomotives, build three new passenger cars, and save more than 6,300 yuan in raw material costs. Workers at the First Construction Site of the Baoding Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau saved building materials worth more than 410 yuan in completing the task of laying more than 67,500 bricks in the four days from June 17th to 21st.

    张家口唐山保定等市工人
    用增产节约来纪念党的生日
    本报保定30日电　张家口、唐山、保定等市的工人们都拿增产节约的成绩来庆贺党的生日——“七一”。张家口市探矿厂机械车间原有十几台B型小东北车床，过去常出毛病，每次修理起码要用二十个小时，严重地影响着车间生产任务的完成。修理小组的青年孙洪根经过多方研究，想出了在联合器上作了一个皮带轮套，只用两小时就可以把车床修理好。开滦煤矿职工给党的生日的献礼是6月份1至23日全矿多产煤一万二千二百多吨。至此，全矿已提前完成了今年上半年的国家计划。唐山发电厂职工宿舍工地的抹灰工人们改变了抹灰的操作方法，提高了工作质量，消灭了高低不平的现象。唐山机车车辆修理厂于本月20日提前全面完成上半年生产计划后，还要再多修理六台机车、新制三辆客车，并要节约六千三百多元原材料费。保定市建筑工程局第一工地的工人们从6月17日至21日的四天中，在完成了六万七千五百多块的砌砖任务中就节约下价值四百一十多元的建筑材料。
