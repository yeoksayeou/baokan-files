Six Professors Somersault

　　The June breeze,
　　Tickles the heart, the six professors' meeting
　　Chose a good time. An emergency whistle like a muffled fart escapes from the trouser leg, secretly, secretly
　　Sneaked in Zeng, Qian, Fei, Tao, Wu, and Huang. The meeting, ah, was held very "well," seven mouths, ah, released a ping ping pang; Chapter "leader," ah, happy until his neck neck neck turned red, words and food and drink moved together in his mouth: "What is the situation?" "'May Fourth', the eve of the Hungarian incident!" "What to do?" "Decide to rebel and launch a major offensive!" While the Communist Party is still conducting "erroneous estimates" of the rectification campaign, while the masses' interest in making suggestions to the Party is at its peak, slap him with a string of labels: "The whole Party is divorced from the masses"…!!! Give him a heavy blow: "Guilty and without merit"…!!! Quickly instigate "students to take to the streets and unite with citizens," want to find a leader? We pat our chests! Matches, torches, kerosene, gunpowder are used together, light it! Burn it! Explode it! From north to south and west to east. The victory drumbeats of the meeting beat cha peng peng, hee hee! Step down!!! Heroes who have "overfulfilled their tasks"! We six professors, seven demons, and eight monsters want to ascend the stage and become dragons, hey! Hold on tight to old Luo! Zeng, Wu, ah, Fei Xiaotong! Happy! Happy! Beyond description, the crazy dream of the dozen days after the meeting; Not good, at the last minute, the workers and peasants are angry, students, intellectuals… follow, ouch! Where have our people gone? Where have they gone? Help! Gudu! Gudu! Gudu!…
