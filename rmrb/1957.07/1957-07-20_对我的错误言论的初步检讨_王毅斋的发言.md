I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao’s speech “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People” and Premier Zhou’s “Government Work Report.” I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am determined to work hard for the great socialist cause under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

As a People's Representative, I committed errors consciously and unconsciously from the very beginning of this rectification movement, and I feel deeply saddened and ashamed. Today, I would like to make a preliminary self-criticism with a responsible attitude towards the people, and I sincerely hope that all representatives will give me more criticism and help!

After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the instructions on rectification, I, like other people, studied the documents while participating in the symposiums held by the United Front Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Unexpectedly, I made many mistakes when I spoke for the first time at the first symposium. For example, I said that I had a position without power when I was at Henan University, and I also said that some party members didn't recognize their relatives; at another symposium, my speech on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries also showed a vague understanding, unstable position, and so on.

When I had already made these mistakes, I subjectively thought that I was sincerely helping the Party to rectify its work. At the same time, when my comrades criticized my speech, I thought I had been wronged. Later, with the in-depth development of the rectification, my horizons gradually broadened, and my ideological understanding gradually became clearer and improved. Especially after repeatedly studying and discussing the two reports of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, I realized that there were deviations and errors in my ideological viewpoints.

“Having a Position without Power” Problem

First of all, about the problem of "having a position without power": Before the "Three-Anti" ideological reform movement, when I was the Secretary-General of Henan University, I had long believed that I had a position without power, and I could also isolate some phenomena to "prove" it. In fact, what I said about having a position without power was roughly the same as the third situation pointed out by Premier Zhou in his Government Work Report. That is, mainly at that time, my thinking had not been transformed, I had not learned new working methods, and there were many problems in my ideology, awareness, and work style. In this way, I naturally could not fulfill my responsibilities. Under these circumstances, the Party's responsible comrades painstakingly took care of the overall situation, did complex work, and completed arduous tasks, which was worthy of admiration and learning. However, at that time, I didn't think that I should humbly learn from him and help him do what I could. Instead, I thought that he was the reason I had a position without power, and I was full of complaints and resistance. Even during this rectification, I was still brooding about it and it was easily triggered. Recalling the reason why I made this mistake back then, it was because I started from individualism and妄想 (妄想: in this context implies foolishly desiring) to use "my" powers to make a sensation and stand out. Furthermore, at that time, I still held the old society's wrong view of the meaning of so-called power, that is, a person could freely exercise his power within the scope of his duties. Because of this, in the old society, it became inevitable that "once power is in hand, orders are issued," and even "take whatever you want" and "act arbitrarily." How absurd this is! In the new society, it is very different. The power in our people's democratic system is set up to implement the country's policies, and anyone who exercises power must abide by the principle of collective leadership. Whether a person has a position and power, and whether he is dutiful and responsible, must be measured by the above two standards. Therefore, any isolated or split view of power, any individualistic or departmentalist ideas, are wrong. During the "Three-Anti" ideological reform, my erroneous thinking had already been criticized, and the problem of having a position without power had basically been resolved. However, during the rectification, I felt that there was still a phenomenon of having a position without power, so I raised this issue for the Party's reference. Only because I couldn't analyze the problem, I didn't have a clear division of the boundaries of having a position without power. Therefore, when speaking, I couldn't help but be general and vague, which would have a bad impact.

“Not Recognizing Relatives” Problem

Regarding the issue of not recognizing relatives: It must first be affirmed that this sentence was originally a slanderous statement made by the Kuomintang reactionaries for many years of anti-communist propaganda, and it was a malicious slander against Communist Party members. As a revolutionary cadre, I actually said such a thing. No matter what the motive or wording was, it was a serious mistake of losing my position. I now realize that in the great mass movements such as "Land Reform," "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries," "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries," if we don't distinguish between relatives and recognize all of them, then our movement cannot be carried out, and even if it is carried out, it will definitely not be carried out well. In the revolutionary struggle, the interests of the revolution are above all else. When violating the interests of the revolution, not only do we not recognize relatives, but we must also put righteousness before family! Furthermore, if the so-called relatives are landlords, rich peasants, or local tyrants and evil gentry, shouldn't a Communist Party member draw a clear line with these people? Sometimes, the so-called relatives are stubborn, have bad qualities, and have a bad reputation. Some Party members don't have a common language or common feelings with them, so they are alienated from them. This situation may exist, but the vast majority of Party members are standing on the correct position and educating and helping backward relatives. And those who cut themselves off from the Party, cut themselves off from the people, and are beyond redemption, eventually degenerate. Can you say that this is also Party members not recognizing their relatives? It can be seen that whether or not to recognize relatives is completely a matter of position, and saying such a thing is also a matter of position. Without analysis or consideration, I rashly said, "Some Party members even don't recognize their relatives." This sentence easily causes people to have a misconception, as if Communist Party members are so inhuman. In fact, it is not like that. Just like saying that Communist Party members are the most patriotic, Communist Party members are also the most loving of the people, the most human, and the most humane. We know that for decades, in the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, Party members have worked hard, sacrificed heroically, Party members have suffered before and enjoyed after, Party members are selfless and altruistic, and Party members have a high mass viewpoint, revolutionary humanitarianism, and a spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Party members respect the old, cherish the young, respect teachers, love students, and so on. The heroic model deeds made by Party members in these areas are countless. May I ask, is there anyone in the world who is more human and has more humanity than Communist Party members?!

Regarding the Issue of Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries

Regarding the issue of suppressing counterrevolutionaries: My understanding of suppressing counterrevolutionaries is only through studying documents. I have not participated in the struggle and been tempered, and my understanding is not deep enough. Therefore, when I come into contact with some people who reflect on the deviations that occurred in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, I blindly believe that this issue is quite serious. On this issue, I still committed the serious error of ideological confusion and unstable position. For example, a vice professor (member of the Democratic League) of Henan Agricultural College spoke on stage when students were holding a rally, saying that the mistakes made by a certain Party member comrade in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries were "violation of law and discipline." Afterwards, he said at a symposium within the League that his speech was approved by the League branch and asked the League's higher-level organization to support it. At that time, I blindly thought that I was right and said: "As long as you wholeheartedly love the Party and fight for justice, not only will the League support you, but our leading Party and the broad masses of people will support you." Obviously, treating attacks on the Party as "just struggles" is extremely absurd. But at that time, I didn't know what was wrong with my words and the ideological understanding expressed through my words. Later, when I saw the reactionary remarks and sinful actions of the rightists revealed across the country, I realized that my words were right-leaning and enough to fuel the arrogance of the rightists in opposing the Party and socialism. On this issue, the comrades criticized me for "ideological confusion and unstable position," which is pertinent and correct. I express my sincere acceptance and serious self-criticism.

I think the mistakes I made are by no means limited to this, and there may be even more serious ones. Fortunately, after the closing of the conference, I returned to the local area to participate in the rectification within the Democratic League and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth review, so I won't list them here.

Before coming to Beijing to attend the meeting, I did not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness and harm of my mistakes. Since coming to Beijing on the 16th of last month, I have seen the increasingly numerous criminal facts of the rightists in opposing the Party and socialism, and I have also participated in the ranks of the anti-rightist struggle. Especially after studying the reports of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, clarifying the six criteria for drawing a clear line between right and wrong, and finding ideological weapons for the struggle, I have become clearer in my mind, brighter in my eyes, and more courageous. Now I express to the Party and the people of the whole country: I have made up my mind to not only draw a clear line with the rightists, but also resolutely fight against the rightists. To be tempered in the struggle. For me, this anti-rightist struggle will be a serious test. If I don't wake up in time, raise my vigilance, distinguish between right and wrong, stand firm, and resolutely fight against the rightists and my own decadent thoughts, it is hard to say that there will be no danger of turning to the right in the future. Facts have proved that some people have indeed been captured by rightist ambitious elements. Speaking of this, I not only feel heartache for the mistakes I have made, but also feel scared, and at the same time, I am even more grateful to the comrades for their timely help, so that I will not fall into the quagmire of the rightists.

How did my mistakes arise? There are many reasons. First of all, it is because my theoretical level is not high, my political sense is not keen, and I don't have a deep and correct understanding of the spirit of helping the Party to rectify its work. Therefore, I have a great deal of blindness from the beginning. I hear some anti-Party remarks and fail to distinguish between right and wrong, and distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. In addition, I am not serious enough in politics on weekdays, and I don't consider the political impact when I speak. Therefore, I often make mistakes in words and actions: unclear boundaries, inaccurate measures, and unstable positions.

It is time to fundamentally eliminate bourgeois ideology

Secondly, the most fundamental reason for my mistakes is that my old intellectual's ideology has not been well transformed. In my thinking, in addition to the subjective thinking method, there is also individualism that cares about fame and status, and selfishness, as well as individual heroism that is arrogant and self-righteous. My saying things like "not recognizing relatives" shows that I still have some feudal consciousness left in my mind; being troubled and disheartened when criticized by comrades also exposes the weaknesses of bourgeois intellectuals—narrow-mindedness, love of face, sentimentality, fragility... In general, there is still a fairly serious bourgeois influence and the remnants of feudal consciousness in my thinking. I have been troubled by a lack of awareness of this erroneous ideological situation, and instead of strengthening my subjective efforts for self-reform, I have fostered a blind sense of complacency, feeling that my ideological reform is almost complete. Therefore, when this rectification movement encounters some storms, I immediately become confused and my position wavers. This shows that for intellectuals like me who come from such backgrounds, ideological reform is still a long and arduous task. Some rightists and those who follow the rightists in shouting against ideological reform are either ulterior motives or do not know their own limitations. From my personal experience, I deeply realize that this anti-rightist struggle is the most vivid Marxist-Leninist political lesson for me, and it has given me a profound tempering of revolutionary struggle. At present, our country's socialist revolution has basically been completed, and the social system has undergone fundamental changes. As Chairman Mao said: "Because our country's social system has changed, and the economic foundation of the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated, this makes the world outlook of a large number of intellectuals not only necessary but also possible to change." According to my personal experience, although the past ideological reform has achieved great results, that ideological reform focused on opposing pro-American, pro-American, and fearful-American thoughts, and the bourgeois world outlook of many old intellectuals has not been completely transformed. Now, the socialist economic base inevitably requires a socialist ideology that is compatible with it. Therefore, Chairman Mao instructed: "In order to fully meet the needs of the new society, in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook, and establish the proletarian communist world outlook."

Fellow representatives, these days have made me clearly realize that now is the time for me to fundamentally eliminate bourgeois ideology. I will definitely meet the new historical period with a new revolutionary attitude. I will definitely participate in the anti-rightist struggle, resolutely smash the attack of rightist ambitious elements, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, establish a proletarian communist world outlook, and unite closely with the workers and peasants around the Party and Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I will dedicate all my strength to building our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country!

    对我的错误言论的初步检讨
    王毅斋的发言
    我衷心拥护毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的演讲和周总理所作的“政府工作报告”，完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、董必武院长、张鼎丞检察长、彭真副委员长所作的各项报告，并坚决在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为伟大的社会主义事业而努力。
    我身为人民代表，在这次整风运动一开始就自觉不自觉地犯了错误，感到十分沉痛和惭愧。今天在这里谨以对人民负责的态度，作一次初步的自我检讨，恳切地希望各位代表对我多加批评和帮助！
    中共中央的整风指示公布之后，我和其他人士一样，一面学习文件，一面参加中共河南省委统战部召开的座谈会。不料在第一次座谈会上第一次发言时就犯了不少的错误，如我说：我在河南大学时有职无权，又说有些党员六亲不认；在另一次座谈会上，我关于肃反的发言，也表现了认识模糊、立场不稳等等。
    当我已经犯了这些错误的时候，自己在主观上还以为是诚心诚意地帮助党整风，同时，同志们批评了我的发言，我还以为受了委屈。后来随着整风深入的发展，眼界逐渐扩大，思想认识逐渐明确与提高，特别是在反复地学习、讨论毛主席和周总理的两个报告之后，才体会到自己在思想观点上是有偏差和错误的。
    “有职无权”问题
    首先说有职无权问题：“三反”思想改造运动以前，我在河南大学任秘书长时，长期认为自己是有职无权，而且也能孤立地摆出一些现象，以资“证明”。其实，我所说的有职无权，与周总理在政府工作报告中所指出的第三种情况大致相同。即主要是那时我的思想没有改造，没有学会新的工作方法，思想意识、工作作风都存在着许多问题，这样，自然无法尽到自己的职责。在这种情形之下，党的负责同志苦心孤诣地照顾全局，做好复杂的工作，完成艰巨的任务，这本是值得钦佩和学习的。然而，当时我没想到应当虚心向他学习，协助他做些自己所能做的事，反而认为是他使自己有职无权，满腹牢骚，情绪抵触，一直到这次整风时还耿耿于怀，一触即发。回忆我当年所以犯了这种错误，是由于我从个人主义出发，妄想借着行使“我的”职权，轰轰烈烈有所“建树”，来突出地表现自己。再者，我当时对于所谓职权的涵义，仍抱着旧社会的错误看法，就是一个人在自己的职权范围之内，可以自由行使自己的职权。正因为如此，所以在旧社会“一朝权在手，便把令来行”，甚至于“予取予求”、“作威作福”，就成为势所必至，理由固然了。这是多么的荒谬！在新社会里就大不相同了，我们的人民民主制度中的职权，是为了贯彻执行国家的方针政策而设的，任何人行使职权，都必须遵守集体领导的原则。一个人是否有职有权，是否尽职尽责，都是要用以上两个标准来衡量的。因而对于职权任何孤立的或分裂的看法，任何个人主义的或本位主义的想法，都是错误的。在“三反”思想改造时，我的这种错误思想已经受到批判，而有职无权问题，也已基本上得到解决。但是，在整风时，我觉得还存在着有职无权的现象，所以我把这问题提出来，供党参考。只因我对于问题不会分析，因而对于有职无权的界限，就没有相当明确的划分，从而在发言时，就不免笼统模糊，这样，就会有不良影响的。
    “六亲不认”问题
    关于六亲不认问题：必须首先肯定：这句话原来是国民党反动派多年反共宣传的一句谰言，是对共产党员一种恶毒的诬蔑。我作为一个革命干部，竟说出这样的话来，不管动机如何，不管措词如何，都是犯了丧失立场的严重错误。我现在认识到：在“土改”、“镇反”、“三反”、
  “五反”、“肃反”各种伟大的群众性运动中，如果对于六亲不加区别而都要认的话，那我们的运动就搞不起来，即使搞起来，也一定搞不好。在革命斗争中，革命的利益高于一切。当违反革命利益时，不但不认六亲，而且还要大义灭亲呢。再者，如果所谓六亲，或是地主富农，或是土豪劣绅，作为一个共产党员还不应该和这些人划清界线吗？有时所谓六亲，头脑顽固，品质恶劣，舆论甚坏，某些党员和他们没有共同的语言，没有共同的感情，因而和他们疏远的情况，容或有之，但是绝大多数的党员都是站在正确的立场上，对于落后的亲友进行教育、帮助，而某些自绝于党、自绝于人民、不堪救药的人，终至堕落下去，难道你能说这也是党员六亲不认吗？可见六亲认与不认，完全是一个立场问题，说这样的话，也是一个立场问题。而我不加分析和考虑，竟轻率地说：“有些党员甚至六亲不认”，这句话容易引起人们一种错觉，好像共产党员多么不近人情似的。其实不然，如同说共产党员最爱国的一样，共产党员也是最爱人民的，是最近人情、最有人情味的。我们知道，几十年来在中国革命和社会主义建设中，党员艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，党员吃苦在前、享乐在后，党员大公无私、舍己为人，党员有高度的群众观点，有革命的人道主义和全心全意为人民服务的精神，党员尊老、慈幼、敬师、爱徒等等，在这些方面党员所作出的英雄模范的事例是不胜枚举的。试问世界上还有那种人比共产党员更近人情、有更多的人情味！？
    关于肃反问题
    关于肃反问题：我对于肃反的了解，只是通过文件的学习，没有参加斗争受到锻炼，体会得不够深刻，所以一接触有些人反映肃反中发生偏差的情况，自己就盲目地认为这个问题相当严重。在这个问题上，我仍然犯了思想混乱、立场不稳的严重错误。例如河南农学院有一位副教授（盟员），正当学生开大会闹事之际，登台讲话，说什么在肃反中某党员同志所犯的错误是“违法乱纪”。事后他在盟内座谈会上说，他的讲稿是经盟支部通过的，并请盟上级组织给以支持。我当时盲目地自以为是地说：“只要一心热爱党，作正义的斗争，不但盟支持，我们的领导党和广大人民都支持。”很显然，这种把向党进攻当作“正义斗争”，是十分荒谬的。但在当时我还不知道我的话和通过我的话所表达的思想认识有什么错误，后来看见全国揭发出来的右派分子的反动言论和罪恶行动，才认识到我的话是右倾的，足以助长右派分子反党反社会主义的气焰。在这个问题上，同志们批评我“思想混乱，立场不稳”是中肯的、正确的，我表示诚恳接受，认真检讨。
    我想我犯的错误决不止此，可能还有更严重的。好在我在大会闭幕之后，即回地方投入盟内整风，进行全面深入的检查，这里就不多列举了。
    在来京开会以前，我对于自己错误的严重性和危害性是认识不足的。自上月十六日来京后，看到了揭发右派分子越来越多的反党反社会主义的罪恶事实，自己也参加了反右派斗争的行列，特别是自学习了毛主席、周总理的报告，明确了划清是非的六条标准，找到了斗争的思想武器，头脑清醒了，眼睛明亮了，勇气增加了。现在我向党和全国人民表示：我已下定决心，不但与右派分子划清界限，而且坚决向右派分子进行斗争。在斗争中受到锻炼。在这次反右派斗争中，对我来说，将是一个严重考验，如果我不及时地清醒过来，提高警惕，辨明是非，站稳立场，坚决与右派分子以及自己的腐朽思想作斗争，就很难说将来没有从向右看到向右转的危险。事实证明，确实有一些人已经作了右派野心分子的俘虏。说到这里，我对于自己所犯的错误，不仅感到痛心，也实在觉得可怕，同时，也更加感激同志们对我的及时帮助，使我不致陷于右派的泥坑。
    我的错误是怎样产生的呢？原因是多方面的。首先是因为自己的理论水平不高，政治嗅觉不灵，对帮助党整风的精神没有深刻而正确的了解，因此一开始就有很大的盲目性，听到一些反党言论，未能明辨是非，分清那是香花，那是毒草；加之自己平日在政治上不够严肃，说话不考虑政治影响，因而在言论行动上就往往犯着：界限不清、分寸不准、立场不稳的错误。
    是从根本上清除资产阶级思想的时候了
    其次，我犯错误最根本的原因，是我的旧知识分子的思想还没有得到很好的改造。在我的思想中，除了主观主义的思想方法而外，还有计较名位、自私自利的个人主义，自高自大、自以为是的个人英雄主义。我说“六亲不认”这一类的话，说明了我头脑中还遗留一些封建意识；受到同志们批评，而感到烦恼、灰心，这些也暴露了资产阶级知识分子的弱点——狭隘、爱面子、温情、脆弱……。总的说来，在我的思想中还有相当严重的资产阶级影响和封建意识残余。这种错误的思想状况，我平日苦于认识不足，对于自我改造，不但不加强主观的努力，反而滋长了盲目自满情绪，觉得自己的思想改造已经差不多了。所以这次整风运动，稍稍遇到些风浪，就马上认识模糊起来，立场动摇起来。由此可见，像我这种出身经历的知识分子，思想改造还是一个相当长时期的艰巨任务。某些右派分子和跟着右派分子叫喊反对思想改造的人，除了别有用心，就是不知自量。从我亲身经验中深深体会到，这次反右派斗争，是给我上了最生动的马列主义政治课，使我经受了一次深刻的革命斗争的锻炼。目前我国社会主义革命已基本完成，社会制度已发生了根本性的变化，正如毛主席所说：“由于我国社会制度已经起了变化，资产阶级的经济基础已经基本上消灭了，这就使大量知识分子的世界观不但有改造的必要而且有了改变的可能。”根据我个人的体会，过去的思想改造，虽然已取得了很大成绩，但那次思想改造着重反对崇美、亲美、恐美思想，而许多旧知识分子的资产阶级的世界观，并没有得到彻底改造。现在社会主义的经济基础，必然要求一个与它相适合的社会主义的意识形态。因此毛主席指示说：“为了充分适合新社会的需要，为了同工人、农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观，而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。”
    各位代表，这些日子使我确切地意识到，现在是我从根本上清除资产阶级思想的时候了。我一定以新的革命姿态迎接新的历史时期。我一定参加反右派斗争，坚决粉碎右派野心分子的进攻，努力学习马克思列宁主义，树立无产阶级的共产主义的世界观，和工人、农民一道紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，在党和毛主席的领导下，为把我们的祖国建设成为一个富强繁荣的社会主义国家而献出自己的一切力量！
