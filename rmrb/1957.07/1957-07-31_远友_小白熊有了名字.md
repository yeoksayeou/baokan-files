Far Away Friend

The Little White Bear Has a Name

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Moscow on the 30th) The little white bear that Soviet aviation personnel in the Arctic gave to the Chinese youth delegation participating in the festival is now waiting for its owner at the Moscow Zoo. It is snow-white all over and very lively. When it's hot, it takes a bath and plays with some other small animals. The cage is crowded with spectators every day.

After the Chinese delegation participating in the festival arrived in Moscow, they quickly sent representatives to see the little white bear. Li Zhiguo, a worker from the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Liu Ying, a combine harvester driver from the state-owned Friendship Farm, named it "Far Away Friend". This matter has become a popular story of the festival.

    远友
    小白熊有了名字
    本报莫斯科30日电  在北极的苏联航空人员送给参加联欢节的中国青年代表团的礼物——一只小白熊现在正在莫斯科动物园等待着自己的主人。它混身雪白，非常活泼，在天热的时候和其他一些小动物一块洗澡、玩耍。每天在这个笼子旁边挤满了观众。
    参加联欢节的中国代表团来到莫斯科以后很快就派了代表去看这只小白熊。长春第一汽车制造厂工人李治国和国营友谊农场联合收割机驾驶员刘瑛给它起了个名字叫做“远友”。这件事情成了联欢节的佳话。
