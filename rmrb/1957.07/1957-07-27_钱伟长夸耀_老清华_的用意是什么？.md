    What is Qian Weichang's Intention in Praising "Old Tsinghua"?
    Zhang Wei, Vice President of Tsinghua University
    Mr. Qian Weichang said to students at the student free forum on May 31st: "Old Tsinghua was not entirely copying the British and American system, but combined it with China's reality."
    Let's see if Old Tsinghua copied the British and American system and what Chinese reality it combined.
    First of all, Old Tsinghua was divided into several colleges of liberal arts, law, and science and engineering, and each college was further divided into several departments. There were no majors below that, let alone enrollment plans and teaching plans. Mr. Qian's class (Department of Physics) had thirteen students when they entered the school, and only seven graduated (ten graduated at the same time, and the other three stayed on from work), with an elimination rate of 46%.
    Old Tsinghua had no clear training objectives. Due to the credit system, students could freely choose courses to a large extent, allowing them to develop as they pleased (the School of Engineering was more restrictive). Taking Mr. Qian's often-praised classmates as an example, students A and B, who graduated in physics from the same class, are the best examples. Student A took six courses in the third and fourth grades: novels, literature, essays, family problems, rural sociology, and general geology. Student B took four courses in the fourth grade: Zuo Zhuan, abnormal psychology, family problems, and Chinese rural social problems. These courses accounted for one-third to one-quarter of their annual course selection. What kind of physics graduates are these? From the course schedules of these two students, we can fully see the blindness of students' learning and the irresponsibility of teachers towards students. May I ask, what is this unplanned, aimless, and spontaneity-praising education system if not copied from American and British capitalist countries? Is it socialist?
    Secondly, Mr. Qian said that Old Tsinghua combined Chinese reality. May I ask what reality it combined?
    The number of students in Old Tsinghua's colleges and departments was blind. The statistics for the four years of 1935, 1936, 1937 (representing the pre-war period) and 1947 (representing the pre-liberation period) show that liberal arts and law accounted for 48%. Mathematics graduated only two or three students each year. According to Mr. Zhuang Qianding's statistics: around 1930, among Chinese university graduates, liberal arts and law accounted for 41%, engineering 8-9%, and science 7-8%. We know that to transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, there is a greater need for science and engineering talents. Enrollment plans are the most fundamental aspect of talent cultivation. Isn't this emphasis on liberal arts and law and neglect of science and engineering in line with the requirements of imperialism ruling China? Isn't it a characteristic of a semi-colony? Is there anything to be proud of in this?
    Let us look again: what Chinese reality did the teaching content of Old Tsinghua combine? At that time, every student had to study the Kuomintang's "Party Principles." The law school had a course called "Dictatorial Politics." Many students from the political science and economics departments chose to take it. Such courses further exposed the reactionary nature of the education of Old Tsinghua and even old China's universities. Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek, the ruler of China at the time, implemented dictatorial rule over the Chinese people. Teaching dictatorial politics in the highest institution of learning was indeed combined with the "Chinese reality" at that time. But this does not represent the actual needs of the Chinese people. Eight years after liberation, Mr. Qian is praising the education of the Kuomintang era. What ideas does this represent? What are his intentions?
    At that time, all the textbooks were American books in English, and even the design specifications we used were the design specifications of New York City and the American railway bridge specifications. In order to ensure that American universities recognized our graduates as having the same academic ability as their graduates when they studied in the United States, Chinese engineering universities completely adopted American university textbooks. Teachers also tried their best to teach in English, and students were proud of it. Examination answers and reports were all written in English. This fully reflects the colonial and semi-colonial education of old China. Does Mr. Qian regard these reactionary educations, which the Chinese people are ashamed of, as the educational characteristics of old China, and think they are worth praising and promoting to college students in New China? Is this the patriotic education and communist education that Mr. Qian Weichang, the "respected educator and scientist," is conducting for young students?
    From these important aspects, we can see what Mr. Qian meant by Old Tsinghua's combination with Chinese reality. It was the colonial education that resulted from the combination of the university education system of the number one imperialist, the United States, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule in old China. Mr. Qian has obliterated the facts, not only indulging in the semi-colonial education system himself but also promoting it vigorously. As the vice president of Tsinghua University in New China, what is the purpose of educating young people in this way? It is hoped that Mr. Qian will expose the activities deep in his mind and let them see the light of day.
    Finally, let's talk about the quality of students in Old Tsinghua, which Mr. Qian praised.
    In his conversation with the students of Physics Class 8, Mr. Qian specifically mentioned that students in Old Tsinghua used to do graduation theses, but now students' abilities are very poor and they cannot do theses. The implication is that as a result of the educational reform after liberation, the quality has been greatly reduced. Let's take a look at what kind of graduation theses the students did before liberation. Taking Mr. Qian's physics department that year as an example: the so-called graduation thesis only accounted for four credits, about 180 hours of work. According to Mr. Wang Zunming (now a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Deputy Department Head), who was in the same class as Mr. Qian: his own graduation thesis at that time was about radio receiving equipment. One topic was done in cooperation by two students, but in reality, the teaching assistant mainly did it, and he assisted, while the other student did very little at all. Mr. Wang's graduation thesis grade was "S-", and Mr. Qian's grade was "N". (Note: At that time, the grades were divided into five levels: E, S, N, I, and F, and even the points were counted in English, which shows the serious degree of colonial education at that time.) Everyone can estimate how high the quality of such a small amount of work and such a graduation thesis could be.
    The above is the situation of the physics department at that time. Comparing the engineering school at that time with the current engineering majors, the engineering school at that time had so-called special reports or special research in the eighth semester, which were elective courses. The credits were generally three (and one credit for the Department of Electrical Engineering). At most, it accounted for one-seventh of a semester's study load, which is less than 100 hours, equivalent to the time for a medium-sized course design now. Its essence was a book report or a large design, and its quality was not as good as the current student research group or large course design. The Department of Electrical Engineering implemented a so-called graduation thesis for one year in 1937, but there was no major difference in essence. Arrangements like the current full-semester graduation design or graduation thesis were not available at that time. As for the methods of cultivating students' independent working ability through a series of course designs and production internships in various majors today, they were even more absent in Old Tsinghua. Therefore, the learning quality of the students at that time was definitely not as good as it is today. This is obvious to all. At that time, there was no current teaching guiding ideology at all, let alone cultivating students' independent working ability. If Mr. Qian is not closing his eyes to the facts, he should admit that it was after the 1952 educational reform that he learned from the Soviet Union's advanced teaching system that the idea of cultivating independent working ability was put forward as a guiding ideology. I don't know why Mr. Qian has also counted this achievement on Old Tsinghua in the Kuomintang era.
    Therefore, Mr. Qian said that Old Tsinghua did graduation theses without explaining what the actual graduation theses were at that time, and compared the quality of engineering students at that time with the current ones, and concluded that the current students are not as good as before. This is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also confuses the public. Mr. Qian cannot say that he does not know these facts. Why does he reverse right and wrong in front of young students? What is his intention?
    This is not the realistic attitude that a scientist should have. What's more, Mr. Qian claims to be an old Tsinghua with decades of experience and the main person in charge of academic affairs since the educational reform. What is the purpose of making such propaganda to students that does not conform to the actual situation? Isn't it actually negating the achievements of educational reform and attempting to make today's education go back to the old road of education in old China?
    Higher education is a part of socialist construction and the superstructure of the socialist economy. Today, higher education must be reformed from the colonial and semi-colonial education that served imperialism and a small number of ruling classes in old China. We must not deny the necessity and achievements of educational reform. We must resolutely expose and refute Mr. Qian's erroneous remarks with ulterior motives with facts.

### 钱伟长夸耀“老清华”的用意是什么？

    钱伟长夸耀“老清华”的用意是什么？
    清华大学副校长　张维
    钱伟长先生在5月31日学生自由论坛上对学生说：“老清华并不完全是照抄英美的一套，而是结合了中国的实际的。”
    让我们看看老清华是否照抄英美的一套和结合了什么中国实际。
    首先，老清华是分成文法理工几个院，每个院再分成几个系，再底下就没有什么专业了，更无所谓招生计划和教学计划。钱先生一班
  （物理系）入学时有十三人，毕业时只余下七人（同时毕业十人，另三人是上班留下来的），淘汰率达46％。
    老清华根本说不上什么培养目标，由于采用了学分制，学生可以在很大程度上自由选课，完全听任学生随便发展（工学院限制得比较严格些）。就拿钱先生经常夸耀的自己那一班同学来看，同班毕业的两个学物理的学生，甲和乙就是最好的例子。甲生在三四年级共选了：小说、文学、散曲、家庭问题、乡村社会学、地学通论等六门课。乙生在四年级一年就念了：左传、变态心理学、家庭问题、中国乡村社会问题等四门课。这些课占他们每年所选课的三分之一到四分之一。请看这是什么样的物理系毕业生？从这两个学生学习课程表可以充分地看出来学生学习的盲目性，和教师对于学生之不负责任。请问这种无计划、无明确培养目标，歌颂自发性的教育制度，不是从美英资本主义国家抄来的是什么？难道是社会主义的吗？
    其次，钱先生说，老清华是结合中国实际的。试问结合了什么实际？
    老清华院系学生数量是盲目的，1935，1936，1937（代表抗战前）和1947（代表解放前）四年的统计是文法占48％。数学每年只毕业二三人。据庄前鼎先生的统计：在1930年前后，我国大学毕业生中，文法科占41％，工科8—9％，理科7—8％。我们知道要使中国由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，理工人才的需要较多。招生计划是培养人才最根本的东西。这种重文法、轻理工不正是符合帝国主义统治中国的要求，不正是半殖民地的特点吗？这有什么值得自豪的呢？
    让我们再看：老清华教学内容结合了什么中国实际？那时每个学生全要念国民党的“党义”。法学院有门课叫“独裁政治”。政治系和经济系的学生选修它的大有人在。由这种课程更暴露出老清华乃至旧中国大学教育的反动性质。不错，中国当时的统治者蒋介石是对中国人民实行独裁统治。在最高学府里讲授独裁政治倒真是结合那时
  “中国的实际”。但这不是代表中国人民的中国实际需要。解放了八年，钱先生倒歌颂起国民党时代的教育来了，这不知是代表了什么思想？是何居心？
    那时的课本全是英文的美国书，连我们用的设计规范全是纽约城的设计规范和美国铁路桥梁规范。为了留美时得到美国大学承认我们毕业生与他们毕业生有同等学力，中国工科大学完全采用美国大学教本。先生上课也尽可能用英文讲授，学生们且以此自豪。考试答题和写报告无一不用英文。这充分反映了旧中国的殖民地和半殖民地的教育。难道钱先生竟以这些为中国人民所引以为耻的反动教育算做是旧中国的教育特色，认为是值得向新中国的大学生加以称赞宣扬的？难道这就是“可尊敬的教育家和科学家”钱伟长先生向青年学生所进行的爱国主义教育和共产主义教育吗？
    从这几个重要方面，我们可以看出钱先生所谓老清华的结合中国实际是什么实际。那是头号帝国主义美国的大学教育制度和蒋介石反动统治的旧中国结合所得出来的殖民地教育。钱先生抹杀了事实，非但自己留恋于半殖民地的一套教育而且还大事宣扬。身为新中国清华大学的副校长这样地教育青年，其目的是什么？希望钱先生将自己的思想深处的活动暴露出来，让它见见阳光。
    最后再谈谈钱先生所夸耀的老清华的学生质量。
    钱先生在向物八学生的谈话中特别提到，从前在老清华学生做毕业论文而现在学生能力很差，做不了论文。言外之意，解放后教学改革的结果，质量大大地降低了。让我们看看解放前学生做的是什么论文。以钱先生那年的物理系为例：所谓毕业论文只占四学分，约为一百八十小时工作。据钱先生同班王遵明先生（现机制系教授，兼副系主任）说：他自己当时毕业论文做的是无线电接收设备。一个题两个学生合作，而实际上主要是助教做，自己加以协助，另一学生则根本不大做。王先生毕业论文成绩是“S—”，钱先生的成绩是“N”。（按：当时评分，以E，S，N，I，F五级计，连计分数也用英文，可见当时殖民地教育习气严重的程度。）这样的分量和这样做出来的毕业论文其质量可能有多高，大家是可以估计得出的。
    以上是当时物理系情况。拿当时工学院与现在的工程专业比较，那时工学院在第八学期有所谓专题报告或专题研究，是选课。学分一般是三（也有一学分的如电机系）。占一个学期的学习分量最多是七分之一，也就是不到一百小时，相当于我们现在一个中型课程设计的时间，其实质是读书报告或大设计的性质，在质量上还不如现在学生科研小组或大课程设计。电机系1937年实行了一年所谓毕业论文，实质上也无大区别。像现在的全学期做毕业设计或毕业论文的安排当时是根本没有的。至于像今天各专业中还用一系列课程设计，生产实习等方式去培养学生独立工作能力的办法在老清华更是没有的了。所以那时的学生学习质量绝没有今天的好，这是有目共见的。那时根本没有今天的教学指导思想，当然也更谈不到培养学生独立工作能力。钱先生如果不是闭眼不看事实，就应当承认把培养独立工作能力作为指导思想提出来，还是1952年教学改革以后学习了苏联的先进教学制度的事。不知道钱先生为何倒将这件功绩也算在国民党时代的老清华身上了。
    因此，钱先生说老清华做毕业论文而不说明那时毕业论文实际是什么，并且就将那时工学院学生的质量与现在的加以比较，得出结论说现在学生不如从前好，不但不符合事实，而且混淆视听。钱先生自己不能说不知道这些事实，为什么又在青年学生的面前颠倒是非，其用心何在呢？
    这不是一个科学家所应有的实事求是的态度。何况钱先生自称是有几十年经验的老清华，又是教学改革以来教务工作的主要负责人，向学生做这样不符合实际情况的宣传，究竟是什么目的，难道不是实际上否定教育改革的成绩，企图使今天的教育走回到旧中国教育的老路上去吗？
    高等教育是社会主义建设的一部分，是社会主义经济的上层建筑。今天高等教育必须从旧中国为帝国主义和国内少数统治阶级服务的殖民地半殖民地教育中改革过来，一定不能否定教育改革的必要性与成绩。对于钱先生那种别有用心的错误言论，我们必须拿事实坚决予以揭露和驳斥。
