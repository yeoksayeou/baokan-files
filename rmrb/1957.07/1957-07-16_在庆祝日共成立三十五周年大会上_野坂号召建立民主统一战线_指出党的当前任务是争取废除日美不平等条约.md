Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 15th: At the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party held in Tokyo yesterday, Nosaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, called for strengthening the party's unity and solidarity, establishing a democratic united front centered on the working class, and struggling to defend peace, smash the San Francisco Treaty system, and abolish all unequal treaties between Japan and the United States.

　　Nosaka Sanzo delivered a speech entitled "The Path the Japanese Communist Party Should Take Currently" at the conference, which was attended by 2,500 people. He analyzed the current situation in Japan and pointed out the current tasks of the Japanese Communist Party. He said that Kishi Nobusuke's trip to the United States and the Japan-U.S. Joint Communiqué he signed in the United States had formed a new situation and presented the party with new tasks. He pointed out that the Japan-U.S. Joint Communiqué meant dragging Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system and opposing domestic progressive forces. The recent modernization of Japan's "defense capabilities" proves that some people intend to arm Japan's "defense capabilities" with nuclear weapons and turn Japan into a forward base for the U.S. atomic strategy. At the same time, the Japan-U.S. Joint Communiqué will isolate Japan among the peace-loving countries of the world, especially in Asia. The task of the Japanese people is to stand with all peace-loving countries.

　　Nosaka said that under this situation, the struggle to ease tensions, oppose the preparation of atomic warfare, ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, reduce armaments, and defend peace is of great significance.

　　Nosaka said that in order to win these struggles, it is necessary to struggle domestically to smash the San Francisco Treaty system and abolish all unequal treaties between Japan and the United States; at the same time, it is necessary to launch a courageous struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of suppression of the Japanese people. Nosaka also pointed out that Japan must establish normal diplomatic relations with countries with which it has not yet restored diplomatic relations. He emphasized that Japan must never ignore its powerful neighbor, China, which has a population of 600 million.

　　Nosaka finally said that in order to achieve the above goals, it is first necessary to overthrow the anti-people and traitorous Kishi Nobusuke reactionary cabinet. He called for strengthening the party's unity and solidarity and establishing a democratic united front centered on the working class.

　　Nosaka also called on members of the Japanese Communist Party to strive for the victory of the Japanese Communist Party's Seventh National Congress, which is scheduled to be held in August.

　　At the celebration, Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, delivered a speech, expressing his respect for the Japanese Communist Party's heroic struggle for Japan's independence, the people's happiness, and world peace under the reactionary forces' cruel suppression over the past thirty-five years. Representatives of many labor unions, peasant organizations, peace organizations, youth and women's organizations, and organizations opposing U.S. military bases also delivered congratulatory messages at the conference.

    在庆祝日共成立三十五周年大会上
    野坂号召建立民主统一战线
    指出党的当前任务是争取废除日美不平等条约
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本共产党第一书记野坂参三昨天在东京举行的庆祝日本共产党成立三十五周年的大会上，号召加强党的统一和团结，建立以工人阶级为中心的民主统一战线，为保卫和平，粉碎旧金山和约体制，废除日美两国间的一切不平等条约而斗争。
    野坂参三在这个共有两千五百人参加的大会上发表了题为“日本共产党当前应走的道路”的演讲。他分析了日本目前的形势，并且指出了日本共产党当前的任务。他说，岸信介的美国之行和他在美国签订的日美联合公报形成了一种新的局面，给党提出了新的任务。他指出，日美联合公报意味着把日本拉入美国的原子战略体系，并且反对国内的进步力量。最近出现的日本“国防力量”现代化的情况，证明了有人打算用核武器来武装日本的“国防力量”把日本变成美国原子战略的前哨基地。同时，日美联合公报将使日本在世界爱好和平的国家中间，特别是在亚洲处于孤立的地位。而日本人民的任务是同一切爱好和平的国家站在一起。
    野坂说，在这种形势下，缓和紧张局势、反对准备原子战争、禁止原子弹和氢弹、裁减军备以及保卫和平的斗争就具有十分重要的意义。
    野坂说，为了争取这些斗争的胜利，在日本国内必须为粉碎旧金山和约体制和废除日美间的一切不平等条约而斗争；同时必须展开勇敢的斗争，反对岸信介政府对于日本人民的镇压政策。野坂还指出，日本必须同没有恢复邦交的国家建立正常的外交关系。他强调说，日本绝对不能忽视拥有六亿人口的强大的邻国——中国。
    野坂最后说，为了实现上述目的，首先要打倒反人民的、卖国的岸信介反动内阁。他号召加强党的统一和团结，建立以工人阶级为中心的民主统一战线。
    野坂还号召日本共产党员为争取预定在8月举行的日本共产党的第七次全国代表大会的胜利而努力。
    在这次庆祝大会上，日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎致词，对于日本共产党三十五年来在反动派残酷的镇压下为日本的独立和人民的幸福以及世界和平而展开的英勇斗争，表示敬意。在大会上致贺词的还有许多工会、农民团体、和平团体、青年与妇女组织、反对美国军事基地的组织的代表。
