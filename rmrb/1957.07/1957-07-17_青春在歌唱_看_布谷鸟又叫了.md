    Youth Sings
    ——Watching "The Cuckoo Calls Again"
    Qiū Yáng
    I think the reason why spring is always regarded as a symbol of happiness and joy is not only because its scenery is pleasant and the breeze is gentle; more importantly, it is full of vigorous vitality, and the thousands of emerging seedlings grow strong, giving the universe a fresh and magnificent appearance; from this, people hear the sound of the fighting footsteps of young life striving upwards.
    "The Cuckoo Calls Again" brings people just such a feeling.
    Undoubtedly, youth itself is beautiful and happy; however, the ice and snow left over from the severe winter and the things undergoing transformation restrain the growth of youth. The most fascinating thing about youth is its unyielding fighting spirit, breaking through all shackles and bravely growing continuously towards a better and higher realm. Youth, that is power!
    People call the heroine in the play, Tóng Yànán, a cuckoo, which has profound meaning. The cuckoo is a symbol of the coming of spring, labor, and struggle. Tóng Yànán is also a banner for striving for happiness for more people. She loves and is loved, but she knows how to choose a soil suitable for the growth of love. The remnants of the old era: twin brothers of male chauvinism and jealousy, once tried to restrain her; brains full of production but forgetting people's minds once neglected her; people who wanted to arrange love with administrative orders once manipulated her; but she did not give in, because she knew how to maintain human dignity and the pride of youth, and she knew even better where to draw the power and support for the struggle. The people loved her and helped her, and therefore, after a period of silence, the cuckoo called again! Yes, spring will always come.
    This is a set of poems about love, labor, and happiness. The writer, director, and actors are all young people, so this is even more a symphony of life full of vitality! We have rarely seen such a rural comedy with a fresh style and vivid characters for a long time, but now we have it, and there will continue to be more in the future, because our life is in an eternal spring of struggle!
    The performance has a poetic and beautiful mood, and the scenery of the Jiangnan region in March is reflected through ingenious stage treatment, which, like the script, can also refresh people.
    May the cuckoo's call resound on the Beijing stage! May the audience in the capital listen to how our youth is singing aloud fluently, gently, but brightly!

    青春在歌唱
    ——看“布谷鸟又叫了”
    丘扬
    我想，春天之所以永远被人当做幸福和快乐的象征，不唯在于它的景物宜人，惠风和畅；更多地在于它充满着茁壮的生机，万千头角乍露的幼苗从而成长壮大，赋予宇宙以清新壮美的面貌；人们由之听到了年轻的生命在争取向上中的战斗脚步声。
    “布谷鸟又叫了”带给人们的恰恰就是这样一种感觉。
    无疑的，青春本身是美好的，幸福的；然而，严寒遗留下的冰雪、正在蜕变中的事物却又束缚着青春的生长，青春最迷人的地方就在于她不屈服的战斗气概，冲破一切羁绊，勇敢地向更美好、更向上的境界不停地生长。青春，这就是力量！
    人们把戏里的女主人公童亚男称做布谷鸟，是寓有深意的，布谷，是春天、劳动和战斗就要来临的象征，童亚男恰好也是一个为更多的人争取幸福的旗帜。她爱着人，也被爱着，但她懂得如何选择一片宜于爱情生长的土壤，旧时代的遗留物：孪生的大男子主义和妒忌，曾经企图束缚过她；一脑子都是生产但却遗忘了人的脑筋曾经冷淡过她；想用行政命令安排爱情的人曾经摆布过她；但她没有屈服，因为她懂得如何维护人的尊严、青春的骄傲，她更懂得从那里去汲取战斗的力量和支持，人民是爱她的，帮助她的，因之，一度无声之后，布谷鸟又叫了！是的，春天总是会来的。
    这是一首爱情、劳动、幸福的组诗。作家、导演、演员也都是年轻人，因而这更其是一首充满着生命力的战斗交响曲！我们久久罕见于这样风格清新、人物生动的农村喜剧了，但现在有了，将来还会继续多下去，因为我们的生活便是在一个永远的战斗的春天之中！
    演出的情调诗般优美，三月江南的景色通过别具匠心的舞台处理体现出来了，和剧本一样，同是可以一新耳目的。
    愿布谷鸟的叫声响彻北京舞台！愿首都的观众去听听我们的青春是如何地在流畅、婉转、但又明快地放声歌唱！
