    Can Double-Cropping Rice be Grown in the North?

    (Our dispatch) The early rice of the double-cropping rice being tested this year by the Tianjin Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Comprehensive Experiment Station has completed tillering in early July and is beginning to head. The double-cropping late rice seedlings being intercropped were transplanted in early July, and the double-cropping late rice being continuously cropped is currently being cultivated.

    The varieties used in the experiment are: for early rice: Aomori No. 5, Yuanzi No. 2, and Ishikari White Hair; for late rice: Suigen 85, Luyu, etc.

    According to people familiar with the situation, this experiment can now illustrate one point: If cultivation techniques are improved, the rice planting period in northern China can be advanced by twenty days to a month.

    北方能不能种双季稻？
    本报讯　天津农林水利综合试验站今年试种的双季稻的早稻，在7月初分蘖完了，开始孕穗。间作的双季晚稻秧苗在7月上旬插下，连作的双季晚稻正在育秧。
    试验用的品种，早稻是：青森五号、元子二号和石狩白毛；晚稻是：水源85、陆羽等。
    据熟悉这方面情况的人说，这个试验现在已能说明一点：如果改进栽培技术，北方地区的水稻可以提早插秧期二十多天到一个月。
