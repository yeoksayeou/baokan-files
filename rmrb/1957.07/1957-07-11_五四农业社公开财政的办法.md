The Five-Four Agricultural Cooperative's Method of Publicizing Finances

    (Our dispatch) The Five-Four Agricultural Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Beijing has been implementing a system of periodic financial disclosure since March. The method is as follows: the cooperative's management committee transfers the accounts of production income, production expenses, member advances, and member investments to each production station for their management. Each station holds a meeting of cooperative member representatives or production team leaders at the end of each month to announce the income, expenses, and member work points for that month. The cooperative member representatives or production team leaders then take this information back to their teams and groups to announce to the members. To ensure that all members are aware of their work points and advances, each member is also issued a work point record book, which is kept by the member after the work point recorder has recorded the work points. The work points are read aloud to the members every ten days. In addition, the cooperative has stipulated that members can review the cooperative's accounts at any time to understand the cooperative's income and expenditure.
    The Five-Four Agricultural Cooperative is a large cooperative with more than two thousand one hundred and seventy households. In the past year or so, due to the large number of people and complex matters, and the chaotic accounts, the cooperative had not announced its accounts to its members. Many members had many complaints and were not very motivated to produce, and the average attendance rate was only 60％—70％; last year, the number of overspending households in the cooperative reached 39.8％.
    Since the financial situation has been made public, the members have gained a clear understanding of the cooperative's financial situation, and everyone is relieved. The labor attendance rate has risen to more than 90％.

    五四农业社公开财政的办法
    本报讯　北京市东郊区五四农业社，从3月份以来实行定期公开财政，办法是：社管委会把生产收入、生产支出、社员借支、社员投资等账目移交给各生产站掌握。各站在每月月底召开一次社员代表大会或生产组长会议，公布当月的收入、支出、社员工分等账目，由社员代表或生产组长带回队、组向社员公布。为了使社员都能知道自己的工分、借支情况，每个社员还发有一本记分手册，记工员在记完工分后，交由社员保管，每十天向社员念一遍。另外，社里还规定了社员可以随时翻看社里账目，了解全社收支情况。
    五四农业社是一个大社，全社有二千一百七十多户。在过去的一年多的时间内，这个社由于人多事杂、账目混乱，没有向社员公布账目。许多社员意见很多，生产积极性不高，平均出勤率只达60％—70％；去年全社超支户达39.8％。
    自从财政公开后，社员摸清了社里的家底子，大家放了心，劳动出勤率已上升到90％以上。
