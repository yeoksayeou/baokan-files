Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 29th: Farmers in the drought-stricken areas of Hunan Province are fully engaged in fighting the drought to protect seedlings and strive for a good harvest of mid-season and late-season rice. According to preliminary statistics, the province is currently deploying more than 3 million laborers daily for drought relief, utilizing approximately 1.3 million pieces of water-lifting equipment. Through the tireless efforts of this labor force, 40% of the drought-stricken rice fields have been irrigated and saved.

In the drought relief effort, Party and government organizations at all levels have successively dispatched more than 5,000 cadres to the countryside to strengthen leadership. They share the hardships and work alongside the farmers, pumping water together to fight the drought. Many leading cadres have also gone to the countryside to direct the drought relief efforts. Song Changrong, First Secretary of the Hengnan County Party Committee, and Secretaries Han Cheng and Zhu Jingxuan went to Tanshan Township, Hongshan Township, and Chejiang Town, respectively, to lead the drought relief efforts, working alongside the farmers to pump water. Encouraged by the actions of the leading cadres, farmers in various places have overcome negative and pessimistic emotions, as well as the侥幸 (jiǎoxìng, lit. lucky) mentality of waiting for rain, and have been pumping water over mountains and ridges to irrigate their fields, persevering in the drought relief efforts to the end. Members of the Jiguan Mountain Agricultural Cooperative in Hengnan County used eighteen waterwheels to pump water continuously for three days and nights from a place several miles away, saving more than 200 mu of seedlings. Under the leadership of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, farmers in the Shaoyang area climbed rocks and drilled holes, opening up more than 50,000 water sources. In Hengyang County, more than 100,000 Communist Youth League members and youth formed drought relief shock teams, water conservation teams, and water source survey teams, and put forward the slogan: "Fight the drought until there is no drought, and don't let the seedlings suffer any losses."

To support farmers in fighting the drought, the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Department originally planned to install 147 pumping stations with a total of 3,000 horsepower in the countryside this winter and next spring, but is now rushing to transport them to various places for early installation and use.

    三百多万劳力日夜抢救
    湖南40％受旱稻田脱险
    新华社长沙29日电　湖南省受旱地区的农民全面展开抗旱保苗，争取中、晚稻丰收。据初步统计，目前全省每天投入抗旱的劳动力达三百多万个，出动各种提水工具约一百三十多万件。经过这批劳动大军夜以继日地奋勇抢救，受旱中的稻田已有40％得到灌溉而挽救出来。
    在抗旱斗争中，各地党、政机关先后抽调五千多名干部下乡，加强领导工作。他们都和农民同甘共苦，并肩车水抗旱。许多领导干部也下乡指挥抗旱斗争。中共衡南县委第一书记宋长荣、书记韩澄、副书记朱静轩分别到谭山乡、洪山乡和车江镇领导抗旱时，和农民一道车水。各地农民在领导干部的行动的鼓舞下，都克服了消极悲观情绪和等天落雨的侥幸思想，翻山越岭地车水灌田，坚持抗旱到底。衡南县鸡冠山农业社社员用十八条水车从几里以外的地方连续三昼夜车水，抢救了两百多亩禾苗。邵阳专区农民在共产党员、共青团员的带动下，爬岩钻洞，共开辟水源五万多处。衡阳县有十万多共青团员和青年组成抗旱突击队、水利节约队和水源勘察队，并提出“有旱抗到无旱止，不让禾苗受损失”。
    为支援农民抗旱，湖南省水利厅原计划今冬明春在农村中安装一百四十七台共三千马力的抽水机，现在正赶运各地提前安装使用。
