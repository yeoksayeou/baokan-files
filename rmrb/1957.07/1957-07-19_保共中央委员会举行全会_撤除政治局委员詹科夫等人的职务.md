Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 16th—The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session on July 11th and 12th. Members of the Central Auditing Commission also attended the meeting. The meeting discussed the issue of Comrade Georgi Chankov's anti-Party behavior. It also reviewed the anti-Party activities of Comrades Dobri Terpeshev and Yanko Panov.

The meeting communiqué stated: The plenary session unanimously agreed to remove Comrade Georgi Chankov from his positions as member of the Politburo of the Central Committee and member of the Central Committee because he engaged in sectarian activities, consistently undermined the unity and collective spirit in the work of the Central Committee Politburo, and implemented a policy line that opposed the Party.

The plenary session also unanimously agreed to remove Comrades Dobri Terpeshev and Yanko Panov from their positions as members of the Central Committee because, despite stern warnings, they continued to engage in activities against the Central Committee, against the Party's line, and against the Party's unity.

The communiqué announced that the plenary session promoted eight comrades, including alternate members of the Central Committee, Bao Vaptsarov and Liu Gerasimov, to full members of the Central Committee.

The plenary session also decided to increase the number of members of the Central Committee Politburo from nine to eleven and the number of alternate members of the Politburo from two to four.
