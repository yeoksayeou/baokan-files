    Rather Be Beheaded
  　Zhang Hua
    The Zhang-Luo alliance formulated ten "instructions" for attacking the Communist Party, the second of which was: "... We must do the work of removing hats. When we see someone wearing a hat that doesn't fit, we must help him take it off."
    When buying a hat at Shengxifu, you only need to try it on to see if it fits. To see if a political or ideological hat fits, it is a bit more complicated, but as long as you have ample materials to accurately measure the caliber of those political thoughts, it is not so difficult to put on a hat that fits. The large amount of revealed material shows that the Zhang-Luo group is a fierce and insidious right-wing alliance. Zhang Bojun has clearly admitted this fact, but Luo Longji, another leader of this alliance, stubbornly refuses to admit it and dares to say: "If there are small group activities, you can kill me." It seems he would rather be beheaded than wear a hat.
    Clearly, it is the most fitting hat, but he stubbornly refuses to wear it. Isn't this cutting himself off from the people? Then, who do they want to help remove hats? Isn't this also very clear!

    Their fourth "instruction" is "... We must do political insurance work. As long as this person is not a real counter-revolutionary, we must protect him politically."
    Everyone has a clear standard in their hearts for who are real counter-revolutionaries. For example, from the materials revealed from all sides, everyone recognizes that Hu Feng is not only a real counter-revolutionary but also a counter-revolutionary leader. However, Zhang Bojun believes that Hu is a "historical figure." That is to say, even if it is handled wrongly now, the case will always be overturned in history. Luo Longji also said that this case was handled wrongly.
    Everyone believes he is a real counter-revolutionary, but they believe he is not. Who do they want to "protect"? Isn't this very clear!

    宁愿杀头
  　张化
    章罗联盟订出十条向共产党进攻的“指示”，其中第二条是：“……要做摘帽子的工作，看见有人被戴上一顶不合头寸的帽子，要帮助他摘下来”。
    到盛锡福买帽子，看合不合头寸，只需戴上试一下，便知分晓。政治上思想上的帽子，要看合不合头寸，虽然复杂一些，但是只要有多方面的材料把那些政治思想的口径量得准，戴上合头寸的帽子也并不那么困难。已揭发的大量材料，都说明章罗集团是个凶狠阴险的右派联盟。章伯钧明明已经承认了这个事实，而这个联盟的另一个头子罗隆基却硬要抵赖，居然敢说：“如有小集团活动，可以杀我的头。”似乎他宁愿杀头，也不愿戴帽子。
    明明是最合头寸的帽子，却死不肯戴上，这岂不正是自绝于人民吗？那么，他们要帮助什么人摘帽子，这不也是很清楚的吗！
                        ＊　＊　＊
    他们的第四条“指示”是“……要作政治保险工作，只要这人不是真正的反革命分子，在政治上要保护他。”
    哪些人是真正的反革命分子，大家心里是有明确标准的。譬如，从各方面揭发的材料，谁都认得出胡风不仅是真正的反革命分子，而且是反革命头子。然而章伯钧认为胡是“历史人物”。那就是说，现在办错了，将来在历史上总会翻案的。罗隆基也说这案子搞错了。
    大家认为是真正的反革命，他们认为不是。他们要“保护”什么人，这不是很清楚的吗！
