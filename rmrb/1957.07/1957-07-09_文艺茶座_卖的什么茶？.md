What Kind of Tea Does the "Literary Tea House" Sell?
    Moxie
    The "Literary Gazette" has added a new column starting from the eighth issue - "Literary Tea House." The "Opening Remarks" is a doggerel: "Discuss literary circles' affairs, tear down walls and fill ditches, expose evil and promote good, report joy and report sorrow."

    Judging from the "Opening Remarks," this must be a very attractive column, but, like lighting a lamp – in reality, it is not. In this column, there is no humorous satire, no well-intentioned criticism, only a distorted criticism and personal attacks. Empty words are no proof, let's cite examples as evidence. The first issue has an article called "Fan-Shaped Zone," criticizing Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. It said that once when he was watching a movie, a fan-shaped zone in front of him was not allowed for others to sit. If such a phenomenon did exist, it should be criticized. However, what people do not understand is why the author adopted an exaggerated method of uglifying the other party to arouse people's disgust, and the implication is so obscure? An article in the same issue, "An Actor's Request to See," "imagined" even more wonderfully. "An Actor's Request to See" narrates that a film actor was treated coldly when he requested to see Chen Huangmei, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau. Of course, this phenomenon of not caring about actors should also be criticized. What people cannot agree with is that the author actually associated such a thing with Chen Huangmei's hobby of raising tropical fish, and took the opportunity to say: "As a leading comrade, his understanding of the actors' hearts does not seem to be as good as his understanding of the performance of tropical fish." This is a provocative association, clearly implying that this leader treats actors worse than his favorite little animals! Where is the good intention of this kind of criticism? Zhang Yousong's "Record of Being Silenced," published in the "Literary Tea House" of the eleventh issue of the "Literary Gazette," has an even worse attitude. This Mr. Zhang actually slandered the People's Literature Publishing House's understanding and care for his life – advance payment for manuscripts – as "silencing" his "mouth," and "firing sugar-coated bullets at an indestructible fortress"! I really don't know what Mr. Zhang Yousong's purpose was in writing this article! And what was the purpose of the "Literary Tea House" in publishing this article!

    In addition to this kind of named attacks, there is also a kind of anonymous attack. Saying it's anonymous is not entirely true, because the facts it lists are obvious to discerning people. An article titled "Tenfold Increase in Value" in the "Literary Tea House" of the twelfth issue of the "Literary Gazette" attacks a so-called writer who was "specially cultivated," saying "his works were praised in a report by Comrade Zhou Yang, so his reputation increased tenfold"; "holding several important positions inside and outside the Party in the Writers Association"; "his name is also listed before the old writers in the 'Harvest' editorial board list"; "of course, he is indispensable for overseas travels," etc. The author believes that "this phenomenon is amazing," but I don't understand what is so amazing about it. A writer has written excellent works and has been praised by the Party, so he has received social attention. Isn't this a very common thing in our society? I don't understand why this author is so surprised and attacks it with such hatred!

    Vulgarizing the serious weapon of criticism into personal attacks, drawing white spots on the nose of the criticized with exaggerated individual facts, is not helping the leaders rectify their work, but maliciously uglifying them in front of the masses, arousing people's contempt, and creating a bad impression.

    Of course, based on these facts alone, one cannot blame the editors of the "Literary Tea House," because it is difficult for any column in a publication to avoid publishing a few bad articles. However, the problem is that these articles represent the direction of the "Literary Tea House." It is said that not long ago, the editors of the "Literary Tea House" were still collecting individual words and deeds of certain literary leaders everywhere, checking records, collecting rumors, and extracting phrases as "evidence" for attacks. Therefore, until now, I still cannot understand what kind of tea the "Literary Tea House" is selling? What kind of role does this "tea house" want to play in the rectification campaign: is it to seriously help the Party rectify its work, or for something else!

### “文艺茶座”卖的什么茶？

    “文艺茶座”卖的什么茶？
    莫邪
    “文艺报”从第八期开始，增加了一个新的栏目——“文艺茶座”。“开场白”是一首打油诗：“议论文坛事，拆墙并填沟，揭恶亦扬善，报喜也报忧。”
    从“开场白”看来，这一定是一个非常吸引人的栏目，可是，电灯点火——其实不然，在这栏目里，并没有幽默的讽刺，善意的批评，有的只是一种被歪曲的批评和人身攻击。空口无凭，还是举例为证。第一期上有一篇“扇形地带”，批评文化部电影局局长王阑西同志。说他有一次看电影，在他面前展开的一块扇形地带，不准旁人坐。如果确有这种现象，是应该批评的。但是，使人不了解的是，作者为什么要采取丑化对方的夸张的手法，来引起人的恶感，而且寓意又那么隐晦呢？同期上的一篇“演员求见记”就“联想”得更妙了。“演员求见记”是叙述一个电影演员求见电影局副局长陈荒煤，受到了冷遇。当然这种不关心演员的现象，也同样是应该批评的。而使人不能同意的是，作者从这样一件事情居然联想到了陈荒煤喜欢养热带鱼的嗜好，并且借题发挥地说：“作为一位领导同志，他对演员的心，似乎还没有对热带鱼的性能那样了解。”这真是一种挑拨性的联想，分明是暗示人们：这个领导人对待演员还不如对待他喜欢的小动物哩！这种批评的善意在哪里呢？在十一期“文艺报”的“文艺茶座”上发表的张友松的“封嘴记”，态度就更加恶劣了。这位张先生把人民文学出版社对他生活的体谅和照顾——预支稿酬，竟污蔑为是“封”他的“嘴”，是在“向一座不可摧毁的堡垒放出糖衣炮弹”！真不知张友松先生写这篇文章的目的何在？“文艺茶座”发表这篇文章的目的又何在！
    除去这种点名的攻击，还有一种匿名的攻击。说它匿名，实际上并不完全如此，因为它所列举的事实，明眼人是一目了然的。十二期“文艺报”的“文艺茶座”上有一篇题名“身价十倍”的文章，攻击一个所谓被“重点培养”的作家，说“他的作品在周扬同志的一次报告中曾受到表扬，于是声价十倍”：“身兼作协党内外数要职”；“‘收获’编委名单中，其大名亦列于老作家之前”；“出国游历当然少不了他”等等，作者认为“这个现象是值得惊叹的”，但我却不明白这有什么可惊叹之处。一个作家写出了优秀的作品，受到了党的表扬，因而得到了社会的重视，这在我们的社会里，不是很普通的事情么？我不明白这位作者为什么要这样大惊小怪，这样深恶痛绝地加以攻击！
    把严肃的批评武器庸俗化到进行个人攻讦，用夸大了的个别事实给被批评者鼻子上画白点，这并不是帮助领导人整风，而是不怀好意地在群众面前丑化他，引起人们的鄙视，造成恶劣的印象。
    当然，仅仅根据这些事实，是不能责备“文艺茶座”的编者的，因为任何一个刊物的栏目，都很难避免发表几篇坏文章。但是，问题在于这些文章却正代表着“文艺茶座”的方向。据说不久以前，“文艺茶座”的编辑同志，还到处搜集有关某些文艺界领导同志的个别言行，查对记录，搜集传闻，摘录词句，以作为攻击的“根据”。因此，一直到现在，我还不能了解，“文艺茶座”究竟卖的是什么茶？这“茶座”究竟想在整风中起什么样的作用：是严肃地帮助党整风，还是为了其他的什么！
