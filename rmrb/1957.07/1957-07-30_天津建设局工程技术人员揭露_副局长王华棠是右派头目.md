Tianjin Construction Bureau Engineering Technicians Expose Deputy Director Wang Huatang as a Rightist Ringleader

    (Report) The People's Daily exposed on June 12th on its second page that Li Peiying, an engineer at the Tianjin Municipal Civil Architecture Design Institute, publicly made reactionary remarks such as "Revolution is worse than changing dynasties." According to a forum held by engineering technicians of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau and the temporary branch of the China Democratic League within the bureau, this rightist element dared to launch such a frenzied attack on socialism because he received encouragement and support from Wang Huatang, a member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Director of the Engineering Technology Work Committee, and Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau.

    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Wang Huatang held two symposiums to encourage engineering technicians to "fully air their views" and introduced the experience of "igniting the fire." At the League branch meeting presided over by Wang Huatang on May 24, he incited everyone to attack the Party, saying: Nanjing University is doing a good job, the big-character posters are very lively, and even the old professors who were unwilling to speak have spoken up, putting the Communist Party in a difficult position. He also said that Beijing is also very lively, with many problems exposed, and the students have all risen up.

    Members of the China Democratic League, such as Wang Lijin, revealed that after Wang Huatang participated in the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" inspection team of the Municipal People's Congress and the CPPCC to inspect Tianjin University, he repeatedly told them: There are many problems with the suppression of counterrevolutionaries at Tianjin University, and the problems are very big.

    After the launch of the anti-Rightist struggle, Wang Huatang pretended to be calm on the surface, did not confess his problems, and tried to prevent League members from participating in the anti-Rightist struggle. At the League branch meeting on June 17, some League members requested a discussion and criticism of the twenty-one issues summarized by the Construction Bureau Party Group based on the reactionary remarks of rightist elements within the bureau and the Tianjin Civil Architecture Design Institute. Wang Huatang said that these twenty-one issues were nothing to discuss. He also pointed out one fallacy made by League member Xue Gansheng (Xue Gansheng said: "Old cadres cannot lead enterprises and should go home to farm.") saying: "What's wrong with that? Some old cadres can go home to farm. What's wrong with that?" As a result, the meeting did not discuss these issues.

    At the forum on July 18, Wang Huatang made a two-hour empty "self-criticism," which immediately aroused everyone's anger, and they unanimously demanded that he must honestly confess.

    天津建设局工程技术人员揭露  副局长王华棠是右派头目
    本报讯　6月12日本报第二版揭露的天津市民用建筑设计院工程师栗培英公开发表“革命比改朝换代更坏”等反动言论，据天津市建设局工程技术人员和该局民盟临时支部的座谈会揭露，这个右派分子所以敢于这样向社会主义猖狂进攻，是得到了民盟天津市委员会委员、工程技术工作委员会主任委员、天津市建设局副局长王华棠的鼓励和支持的。
    在整风开始的时候，王华棠召开过两次座谈会，鼓励工程技术人员“大放大鸣”，并介绍“点火”经验。在5月24日王华棠主持的盟支部会上，他鼓动大家向党进攻说：南大放的好，大字报很热闹，不愿说话的老教授都说话了，将共产党军了。他还说北京搞的也很热闹，揭发的问题很多，同学们都起来了。
    民盟盟员王礼晋等揭露，王华棠参加市人民代表大会和政协“肃反”视察小组在天津大学视察后，回来一再对他们说：天津大学肃反问题很多，问题很大。
    王华棠在反右派斗争开展以后，表面假装镇静，不交代问题，并且多方阻止盟员参加反右派斗争。6月17日在民盟支部会上，有的盟员要求就建设局党组根据局内和天津民用建筑设计院右派分子的反动言论归纳出的二十一个问题进行讨论批判。王华棠说这二十一个问题没有什么可讨论的。他并且指出其中民盟盟员薛淦生发的一条谬论（薛淦生说：“老干部领导不了企业，应当回家去种地。”）说：“这有什么，有的老干部就是可以回家种地。这有什么不好？”结果那次会议就没有讨论这些问题。
    在7月18日的座谈会上，王华棠作了两小时空洞的“检讨”，立即引起大家的愤怒，一致要求他必须老实交代。
