    The "Heart-Winning Strategy" of the Oil Empire
    Xing Xiangchao
    The imperialists have really racked their brains to provoke relations between Arab countries. Not long ago, many articles appeared in British and American newspapers attacking Egyptians who served as teachers in other Arab countries. These articles maliciously smeared Egypt for "exporting teachers" to various Arab countries to carry out so-called "propaganda activities." For example, the British magazine "The Economist" published an editorial titled "The Builders of the Egyptian Empire," which wrote:
    "From Libya to Muscat, the lack of local teachers has required the presence of culturally superior Arabic-speaking Lebanese, Syrians, and Egyptians for many years, among whom the Egyptians have a higher level of teaching in the Arab world. Once Egypt is threatened or attacked, national self-esteem can easily turn these teachers into propagandists. The Egyptians are paid by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, while teaching their next generation that royal power and hereditary rule are outdated and that Westerners deserve ridicule. How much do the King of Saudi Arabia or the Emir of Kuwait understand about this situation?"
    After such a blatant provocation, "The Economist" proposed two solutions: the palliative is for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to follow Iraq's lead and squeeze out Egyptian teachers; the radical solution is to have "educational groups with great traditions (such as the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations) take charge and open a college in Beirut to cultivate talent to train Arab teachers. Because independent oil companies and Western countries are all related to the issue of widely recruiting teacher reserves in the Arab world."
    In the final analysis, "The Economist" finally revealed the colonial rule tail of the "Oil Empire." The Rockefellers, Fords, and their various lackeys have exhausted all means in the political and economic fields to打击打击Arab nationalism, isolate Egypt, and provoke the unity of the Arab world. Now they have thought of making longer-term plans, to seize the younger generation of the Arab nation, thinking that this can eliminate Arab nationalism. It seems that the imperialists are well aware of the importance of the "heart-winning strategy."
    However, today is no longer the era when Western countries could spread fallacies everywhere in the Middle East a hundred years ago. Abdul Asour Hussein, an official in the Ministry of Education of the Emirate of Kuwait, said well in a letter to "The Economist": "The Builders of the Egyptian Empire" is a memoir of con artists, and we have often heard this argument in the recent Middle East crisis. Hussein incisively questioned "The Economist," saying: You are making a big fuss about Egyptian teachers, "isn't it intentional to sow seeds of discord among Arab countries?"
    Western newspapers are enthusiastically calling on Arab countries to squeeze out Egyptian teachers, and may come up with other whimsical ideas in the future. However, all of this will ultimately be in vain. Between national independence and Arab unity, or colonialism and the rule of the oil empire, the younger generation of Arabs will make their own choice.

    石油帝国的“攻心术”
    邢象超
    帝国主义者们为了挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的关系，真是挖空了心思。不久以前，英、美报刊上出现了不少文章，攻击那些在其他阿拉伯国家中担任教员的埃及人。这些文章别有用心地诬蔑埃及在“输出教师”到各个阿拉伯国家去进行所谓“宣传活动”。例如，英国的“经济学家”杂志以社论地位发表的“埃及帝国的缔造者”这一篇文章写道：
    “从利比亚到马斯喀特的每个地方，多年来都因缺乏本地教员而需要文化较高的讲阿拉伯语的黎巴嫩人、叙利亚人和埃及人，其中埃及人的教学水平在阿拉伯世界中是较高的。一旦埃及受到威胁或攻击，民族自尊感就很容易使这些教员成为宣传人员。埃及人领沙特阿拉伯和科威特的工资，而教给他们下一代的却是王权和世袭统治已经过时了，西方人活该受到嘲弄，对于这种情况，沙特国王或科威特的酋长了解了多少呢？”
    在作了这样露骨的挑拨之后，“经济学家”提出了两个办法：治标的办法是沙特阿拉伯和科威特向伊拉克看齐，排挤埃及教师；另一个治本的办法是由“具有伟大传统的教育团体（如洛克菲勒和福特基金组织）主持其事，在贝鲁特开办一个学院，培养人材来训练阿拉伯教师。因为独立石油公司和西方国家对于在阿拉伯世界中广泛物色教师后备力量问题，都是有关系的”。
    万源归宗，“经济学家”最后还是现出了“石油帝国”的殖民统治这条尾巴来了。洛克菲勒、福特及其大小仆从们，在政治经济领域内用尽了一切办法来打击阿拉伯民族主义、孤立埃及和挑拨阿拉伯世界的团结。现在他们想到了要作更长远的打算，要把阿拉伯民族的青年一代都抓到自己手里，以为这样就可以消灭阿拉伯民族主义。看来，帝国主义者们是深知“攻心战略”的重要性。
    但是，今天毕竟不是百十年前西方国家可以在中东到处散布谬论的时代了。科威特酋长国教育部的官员阿卜杜尔·阿苏尔·侯赛因在一封给“经济学家”的信中说得好：“埃及帝国的缔造者”一文是一篇骗子手们的回忆录，在最近的中东危机中我们是经常听到这种论调的。侯赛因一针见血地责问“经济学家”说：你们在埃及教师身上大做文章，“难道不是有意在阿拉伯国家中间散布不和的种子么”？
    西方报纸热心地号召阿拉伯国家排挤埃及教员，将来也可能再异想天开地提出别的一些主意。可是，这一切，最后终将是徒劳的。民族独立和阿拉伯国家团结，或者是殖民主义和石油帝国的统治，在这两者之间，阿拉伯的青年一代将会自己作出选择。
