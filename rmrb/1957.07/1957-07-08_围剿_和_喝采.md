    "Encirclement" and "Cheers"
    Liubing
    Before acting, the rightists anticipated that "over ninety percent" of the people would help them and accomplish their great cause. The result, however, was that "over ninety percent" of the people opposed them. This exceeded the worst outcome they were prepared to accept, and they felt extremely heavy, shouting that this was an "encirclement." In fact, since it is a struggle for power, and the strength of the two sides is so disparate, the "encirclement" naturally forms. Is there any need to be so alarmed?
    As it stands, subduing the rightists is not a difficult task. However, what the Communist Party and the people want is persuasion, that is, to achieve unity through struggle. Unless the rightists completely isolate themselves from the people, the people are not willing to treat them as enemies and subdue them. To make these "heroes" who "don't shed tears until they see the coffin" suddenly repent, it will certainly take more effort, and it is not enough to simply persuade them with gentle words. First, they must be exposed in broad daylight; they must feel that they are universally betrayed and have nowhere to go, and then they may submit and convert, further cleanse their hearts and minds, and be reborn, to achieve genuine unity on the basis of socialism. In this way, persuasion also contains elements of forcing compliance, which is why the "heroes" feel "encircled." But this "encirclement" really stems from the desire for unity.
    However, the rightists' restlessness has received applause from another quarter. Some people are busy "remotely paying tribute to Chu Anping," "applauding" Ge Peiqi, praising "Chu Anping indeed has a trick up his sleeve," and even encouraging the "heroes" to "straighten their spines" and persevere. I don't know if the right-wing heroes are happy to hear this applause. But this should indeed give them pause. Why are the reactionary forces in Taiwan and the lackeys of American imperialism in Hong Kong so enthusiastically cheering and encouraging them? In the eyes of the enemy, the "heroes" who are blinded by greed have rolled themselves to the edge of the boundary. As long as they take the opportunity to pull them, they can make these heroes fall to their side. This is what the Chinese often call "picking up a sheep in passing." A Taiwanese monthly magazine said, "Once the mainland is restored, the intellectuals with the spirit of a fierce tiger, rescued from the red traps, will surely make a great contribution to clearing the red poison from the mainland youth and reviving the Republic of China." A Taiwanese news agency said that the actions of "Luo Longji and other members of the China Democratic League" were responding to their "call." Isn't it clear that someone is already there claiming to be the leader, and even before the throne is built, they are already preparing to be the emperor? Naturally, they regard the "heroes" as "sheep" with "the spirit of a fierce tiger." Such "sheep" are particularly useful to them: if they win, they can be used as tigers, driving them to eat other sheep for them; if they lose, they can be used as "sheep" to serve as sacrifices for their "revival of the Republic of China," without any damage to themselves. There is really nothing more cost-effective than this. The so-called "gratifying phenomenon" and "unignorable starting point" are precisely for this reason.
    However, those who applaud may not know that the strength of the Chinese people today is much greater than when they were driven away. And if the right-wing heroes are really "pulled" over by them, there will be no way out. The reason why they still want the right-wing heroes to brace themselves and "straighten their spines" is really "instigating a silly dog to bite a lion." Anyway, they won't feel sorry if the child they picked up is killed. This intention is really vicious enough.
    Whether the rightists can discern the deep affection of the "encirclement" and the maliciousness of the "cheers" is a basic prerequisite for whether they can be saved. This is something worth the heroes "closing the door" to "consider carefully."

    “围剿”和“喝采”
    流冰
    右派分子们在动手之前，预计会有“百分之九十”以上的人来帮助他们，成其大事。结果却是“百分之九十”以上的人来反对他们。这超乎他们准备接受的最坏的结果，于是乎感到沉重异常，大喊这是“围剿”。其实，既是争夺天下，双方力量又如此悬殊，“围剿”之势自然而成，这用得着大惊小怪吗？
    就现势看，要压服右派分子并非一件难事。可是，共产党和人民所要的是说服，即所谓通过斗争达到团结。倘非右派分子完全自绝于人民，人民还不忍心把他们当敌人去压服。要使这些“不见棺材不落泪”的“英雄”们憣然悔悟，当然要多费些事，而且，只靠婉言相劝是不行的。要先使他们在光天化日之下原形毕露，要使他们感到众叛亲离已无路可走，而后可能俯首皈依，进一步洗面革心，脱胎换骨，在社会主义的基础上，达成真正的团结。这样，说服中也含有迫使就范的因素，这也是“英雄”们有“围剿”之感的原因。但这“围剿”实在是从团结的愿望出发的。
    然而右派分子们的蠢动，却从另一方面获得了采声。有人忙着“遥向储安平致意”，替葛佩琦“鼓掌”，称赞“储安平的确有一手”，甚至鼓励“英雄”们“挺起脊梁”来，坚持下去。我不知道右派英雄们听到这采声是否高兴。不过这的确应该引起他们深思。台湾的反动势力和美帝国主义在香港的奴才这样热心的喝采和打气是为着什么？在敌人看来，利令智昏的“英雄”们已让自己滚到了界限的边缘上，只要趁机会拉一把，就可使这些英雄们倒向他们那边去，这就是中国人常说的“顺手牵羊”了。台湾一家月刊就说：“一旦大陆重光，有猛虎般精神的知识分子，从赤色槛阱中解救出来，相信他们对清除大陆青年的赤毒，和复兴中华民国，必然有极大的贡献”。而台湾的一家通讯社却说：“罗隆基等民盟人士”的行动是响应他们的“号召”。这不明明是已有人在那里以领导者自居，而且，宝座还没搭起，就已经准备来当皇帝了吗？自然，他们是把“英雄”们看作“有猛虎般精神”的“羊”的。这种“羊”对他们的用处也就特别大，胜可以作虎，驱之替他们食另外的羊；败可以作“羊”，以充他们“复兴中华民国”的牺牲，而他们可毫无一点损伤。真是没有比这再合算的事情了。所谓“可喜的现象”“不可忽视的起点”者，正为此也。
    不过，喝采的人却也未必不知道，今天中国人民的力量比赶走他们的时候要大得多。而右派英雄们真的要被他们“牵”过去了，就一定毫无出路。他们之所以还要右派英雄们硬着头皮“挺起脊梁”来，实在是“唆使傻狗咬狮子”，反正拾来的孩子摔死也不会心疼的。这用意实在是够恶毒的了。
    右派分子们能否体察出“围剿”的深情和“喝采”的恶意，是他们可否救药的一种起码的基础。这点是很值得英雄们“关起门来”好好“考虑考虑”的。
