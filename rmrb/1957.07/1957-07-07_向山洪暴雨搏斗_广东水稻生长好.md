    Fighting Mountain Torrents and Rainstorms
    Guangdong Rice Grows Well

    (Our report) Guangzhou – This year, Guangdong Province has suffered from mountain torrents and rainstorms unseen in decades, but after the hard work of the broad masses of farmers in fighting against them, rice is still growing well in most areas. Currently, farmers in various places have begun harvesting. The "Nante" early-maturing variety, recently harvested in the Pearl River Delta, generally increased production by 50 to 70 jin per mu. With the exception of Huizhou Prefecture, which suffered relatively severe disasters and experienced a decrease in production, the other seven prefectures have all seen varying degrees of increased production. At present, the threat of typhoons and insect pests to late-maturing rice is still significant, and various localities are paying close attention.

    向山洪暴雨搏斗
    广东水稻生长好
    本报讯　广东省今年遭受几十年来罕见的山洪暴雨，但经过广大农民奋力抗御以后，目前大部分地区水稻仍然生长良好。现在，各地农民已经纷纷开镰收割。珠江三角洲最近收割的“南特”早熟种，一般每亩增产五十斤到七十斤。除了受灾比较严重的惠阳专区减产以外，其他七个专区都有不同程度的增产，目前台风和虫害对迟熟水稻的威胁仍然很大，各地正在密切注意。　　　　　　　　（李少球）
