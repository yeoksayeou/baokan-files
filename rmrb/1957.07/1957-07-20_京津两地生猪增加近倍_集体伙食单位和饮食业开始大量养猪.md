Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The cumulative number of pigs raised in the suburbs of Beijing in the first half of this year is nearly 300,000, more than 60,000 more than the total number raised in 1956. By the end of June, the average number of pigs raised per farmer household had exceeded one and a half.

This is the initial result of the Beijing municipal Party and government leadership departments' efforts to cultivate the suburbs as a pig production base this year.

The number of pigs raised in the suburbs increased rapidly in the first half of the year. The actual number of pigs at the beginning of the year was only 130,000, but by the end of June it had reached 240,000, twice as many as in the same period last year. The number of sows increased by more than double since the beginning of the year, and it is expected that the suburbs will be able to fully supply the required piglets locally by next year.

In addition to the large number of pigs raised by agricultural cooperative members, the number of pigs raised collectively by collective mess halls and agricultural cooperatives is also increasing, reaching 41,000 by the end of June. Last year, mess halls rarely raised pigs, and the number of pigs collectively managed by agricultural cooperatives was also small.

This newspaper reports: Tianjin's pig production has developed rapidly. By mid-June, there were 69,490 pigs in pens, an increase of more than 34,000 from the beginning of this year. The number of pigs that died from disease was only about one-third of last year's. According to the Municipal Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, one of the important reasons for the low incidence of swine fever is that 80% of the pigs have pens.

The Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy will further mobilize agricultural cooperatives to raise pigs using wild feed. The Happiness Road Cooperative, led by national agricultural labor model Jiang Deyu, has begun collecting and storing pig feed. According to Zhang Caisan, the deputy director of the cooperative in charge of sideline production, there is a large amount of willow algae in the river pits near the cooperative, and they plan to harvest and dry hundreds of thousands of catties to feed the pigs.

Furthermore: The pig farms of the food service industries in the Hebei and Heping districts of Tianjin have been expanded. The expanded pig farms can raise 500 pigs. The pig farm currently has 143 pigs, double the number since its inception.

    京津两地生猪增加近倍
    集体伙食单位和饮食业开始大量养猪
    新华社17日讯  北京市郊区今年上半年的生猪累计饲养量将近三十万头，比1956年全年饲养量还多六万多头。到6月底，平均每个农户的养猪数量已超过一头半。
    这是北京市党政领导部门今年以来把郊区培养为生猪生产基地所取得的初步效果。
    上半年内，郊区养猪量是迅速增加的。年初生猪实存数只有十三万头，6月底达到二十四万头，比去年同期多了一倍。其中母猪头数比年初增加了一倍多，预计到明年，郊区所需要的仔猪就可以完全由本地供给。
    除了农业社社员大量养猪以外，集体伙食单位和农业社集体养猪的数量也在增加，到6月底达到了四万一千头。在去年，伙食单位是很少养猪的，农业社集体经营的生猪也不多。
    本报讯  天津市的生猪生产发展很快，到6月中旬，圈有猪六万九千四百九十头，比今年年初增加三万四千多头，因疫病而死的猪只有去年的三分之一左右。从市畜牧兽医站得悉，猪疫小的重要原因之一是80％的猪有了圈。
    天津市农林水利局将近一步发动各农业社利用野生饲料养猪。全国农业劳动模范姜德玉领导的幸福之路社，已开始收储猪饲料的工作。据这个社负责副业的张才三副主任说，社附近河坑里有大量的柳叶藻，他们准备打晒几十万斤留着喂猪。
    又讯：天津市河北、和平两区饮食业的养猪场已扩建好了。扩建后的猪场能养猪五百只。这个猪场现有猪一百四十三只，比创设初期增加了一倍。
