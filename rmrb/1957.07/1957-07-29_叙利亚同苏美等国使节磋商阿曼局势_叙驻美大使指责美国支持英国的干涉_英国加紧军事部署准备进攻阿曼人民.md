Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Damascus dispatch: The Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General met separately with the diplomatic representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries on July 27 to consult on the situation regarding British intervention in Oman.

After meeting with the Soviet Ambassador, Mr. Nemchina, Foreign Minister Bitar said that they exchanged views on the current situation in the Middle East, especially the liberation movement in Oman and its reactions around the world.

After talking with U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Shishuan, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Talaszi, told reporters that he told Mr. Shishuan that diplomatic efforts were needed to stop British intervention, "especially because Britain is using certain NATO weapons against the Omani insurgents."

Talaszi pointed out that Arab countries are consulting on "what is the best way to protect the independence of Oman" and "which qualified international organization should the Oman issue be submitted to."

Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Zein Eddine, also accused the United States of supporting British intervention in Oman and its position on other Arab issues. He said that the United States has recently "exposed its true anti-Arab intentions."

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Sharjah dispatch: Britain is stepping up its military deployments in the Persian Gulf region in preparation for launching an attack on the Omani insurgents.

Troops of the Sultan of Muscat, commanded by British officers, began to gather in Ibri on the 27th. Ibri is located next to the area controlled by the Omani insurgents. Half of the Sohar regiment of the Muscat Sultan's forces had already entered an area about eighty miles northwest of Nizwa on the evening of the 27th. Nizwa is the headquarters of the Omani insurgents.

The Trucial Oman Scouts, led by British Colonel Stewart Carters, have established an operational headquarters in the Buraimi Oasis and have begun sending patrols to patrol the rugged, sun-scorched roads leading to Ibri. Reinforcements for the Trucial Oman Scouts are gradually heading to the Buraimi Oasis. This force totals about one thousand men. Trucial Oman is a British protectorate on the Persian Gulf coast, adjacent to Muscat Oman and the Buraimi Oasis.

According to Agence France-Presse, quoting well-informed sources in London, the Royal Air Force will intensify its actions against the Omani insurgents because the British government is anxious to suppress the uprising before the end of this week. The report said that the British government believes that if the issue drags on, it may cause international disputes.

    据新华社28日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部部长和秘书长7月27日分别会见苏联、美国和其他一些国家的外交代表，就英国干涉阿曼的局势进行磋商。
    外交部长比塔尔在接见苏联大使?姆钦纳以后说，他们对目前的中东局势、特别对阿曼的解放运动和它在世界各地的反应交换了意见。
    外交部秘书长塔拉齐在和美国代办师曙安会谈以后告诉记者说，他告诉师曙安需要有外交上的努力来制止英国的干涉，“特别是因为英国正在使用北大西洋公约组织的某些武器来对付阿曼的起义者”。
    塔拉齐指出，阿拉伯国家正在磋商“什么是保护阿曼的独立的最好方式”，以及“应该把阿曼问题提交哪一个合格的国际机构”。
    叙利亚驻美国大使宰尼丁同一天指责美国支持英国干涉阿曼以及在其他阿拉伯问题上的立场。他说，美国最近已经“暴露了它的真正的反对阿拉伯的意图”。
    据新华社28日讯　沙贾消息：英国正在波斯湾地区加紧进行军事部署，准备对阿曼起义者发动进攻。
    由英国军官指挥的马斯喀特苏丹的部队27日开始在伊布里集结，伊布里紧靠着阿曼起义者所控制的地区。马斯喀特苏丹部队的索哈尔团有一半已经在27日晚上进入尼兹瓦西北约八十英里的地区。尼兹瓦是阿曼起义者的总部所在地。
    由英国的斯图瓦特·卡特斯上校率领的特鲁西尔阿曼侦察兵，在布赖米绿洲建立了作战总部，并且开始派遣巡逻队巡逻通往伊布里的高低不平、烈日当空的道路。特鲁西尔阿曼侦察兵的增援部队正在陆续开往布赖米绿洲。这支部队总共大约有一千人。特鲁西尔阿曼是英国在波斯湾沿岸的一个保护国，毗邻马斯喀特阿曼和布赖米绿洲。
    据法新社引用伦敦消息灵通人士的话说，英国皇家空军将加紧对阿曼起义者采取的行动，因为英国政府急于在本周末以前压平这次起义。消息说，英国政府认为，如果这个问题拖下去，可能造成国际纠纷。
