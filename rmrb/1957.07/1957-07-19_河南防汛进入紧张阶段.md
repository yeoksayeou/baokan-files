    Henan Flood Control Enters Tense Stage
    (Our Zhengzhou dispatch, July 18) On the afternoon of July 14th, the Funiu Mountain area and the eastern Henan plain in Henan Province experienced another round of heavy rain. Due to the large amount of rain over a wide area, some sections of the river embankments in the eastern Henan plain have collapsed. The cities of Zhoukou, Suixian, Qixian, Ningling, and more than four thousand eight hundred villages have been surrounded by water. The rain has not stopped, and the accumulated water is generally two to three *chi* deep, with the deepest reaching five to six *chi*. The masses and cadres in these areas are working day and night in the rain to carry out rescue efforts.
    Currently, flood control in Henan Province has entered a tense stage. The provincial Party and government leading organs are calling on all farmers and cadres in the province to display revolutionary heroism, bravely fight against the floods, and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn. On July 17th, provincial-level organizations dispatched a group of cadres led by responsible comrades to various locations to guide and assist in flood control work. On the same morning, airplanes were also used to airdrop seventy-six bundles of sacks from Zhengzhou City to Zhoukou City to support flood control efforts. In the afternoon, a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed in Zhengzhou City took off from Zhengzhou City and airdropped ten rubber boats into Suixian City at 5:30 p.m. to rescue trapped people. They also dropped letters of慰问 (wèi wèn - comfort and solicitude) from the CCP Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to workers, farmers, and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army participating in flood control and rescue. When the aircraft supporting flood control circled and dropped supplies over Suixian City and Zhoukou City, the masses cheered. With the care of the Party, government, and army, and the strong support of neighboring areas, the flood control teams are full of confidence to overcome the flood disaster.

    河南防汛进入紧张阶段
    本报郑州18日电  本月14日下午河南省伏牛山区及豫东平原又连降暴雨。由于雨大面宽，豫东平原部分地区河堤溃决。周口市、雎县、杞县、宁陵等县城和四千八百多个村庄被水包围。当前雨还未停，积水一般深达二至三市尺，最深的有五至六尺。这些地区群众和干部正在日夜冒雨抢救。
    目前，河南省防汛已经进入紧张阶段，省党政领导机关号召全省农民和全体干部发扬革命英雄主义，英勇地向洪水作斗争，力争秋季丰收。省直机关已于17日抽调一批干部由负责同志带领分赴各地指导与协助防汛工作。同日上午，又用飞机从郑州市起飞，装麻袋七十六捆空投周口市支援防汛斗争；下午，驻郑州市的中国人民解放军空军某部以飞机从郑州市起飞，五时三十分钟向雎县城内空投橡皮船十支，以抢救被困群众，还投下中共省委和省人民委员会对参加防汛抢险的工人、农民、人民解放军指战员的慰问信件等。当支援防汛飞机在雎县城、周口市上空盘旋投放时，群众欢声沸腾。防汛队伍将在党政军的关怀下以及友邻地区的大力支援下，信心百倍地战胜洪水灾害。
