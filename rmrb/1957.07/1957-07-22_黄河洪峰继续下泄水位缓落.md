Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st. After the Yellow River flood peak entered Shandong, the water level above Sunkou in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, and the water level of Dongping Lake are slowly receding, while the water level below Sunkou is rising. It is estimated that the flood peak will pass through Aishan in Dong'a County tomorrow morning.

Due to the large amount of rainfall in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and its tributaries, the total amount of this flood is large, the high water level has lasted for a long time, and the recession is slow. At 12:00 today, the flow rate of the Yellow River at Qinchang was still 6,850 cubic meters per second. The flow rate of the Wen River tributary at Daicun Dam dropped to 1,060 cubic meters per second at 8:00 today. The water level at Anshan Station in Dongping Lake has also dropped by 0.24 meters compared to the highest water level of this flood.

This flood peak passed through Gaocun, Dongming County, Henan Province at 21:00 on the 20th with a flow rate of 12,000 cubic meters per second, and then entered Shandong Province.

When the two flood peaks of the Yellow River appeared on the 19th and flowed downstream one after another, the river water below Dongbatou in Lankao County, Henan Province, overflowed the beach within the embankment. The water depth at the base of the embankment was one to two meters, and in some places it was more than three meters deep. Some sections of the embankment had been immersed in water for a long time, and some dangerous situations also occurred. However, due to strict defense, early detection and timely rescue, these dangerous situations have mostly been turned from danger to safety.

### 黄河洪峰继续下泄水位缓落

    黄河洪峰继续下泄水位缓落
    新华社郑州21日电　自黄河洪峰进入山东后，目前山东省寿张县孙口以上水位和东平湖水位缓落，孙口以下水位上涨。预计明天上午洪峰将通过东阿县艾山。
    由于黄河中游干支流地区雨量大，这次洪水总量大，高水位持续时间长，回落慢。今天十二时，黄河秦厂的流量还有六千八百五十秒公方。支流汶河戴村坝的流量，在今天八时降落到一千零六十秒公方。东平湖安山站的水位，也比这次洪水最高水位下降了零点二四公尺。
    这次洪峰是在20日二十一时以一万二千秒公方流量通过河南省东明县高村，然后进入山东省的。
    这次黄河在19日一天出现的两次洪峰接踵下泄时，河南省兰考县东坝头以下河水漫上了堤内的滩地。堤根水深一至二公尺，有的地方水深达三公尺多。有些地方堤线浸水较久，也发生了一些险象。但是，由于防守严密，及早发现及时抢护，这些险象多已转危为安。
