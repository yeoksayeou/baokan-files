Xinhua News Agency, 14th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Shikai reports) The China Peking Opera Theater has held four symposiums in recent days, exposing the conspiracy activities of bourgeois rightist elements such as Li Boqiu, under the personal command of Zhang Bojun, actively wooing actors to launch a frenzied attack on the national theater.

　　Some actors who had been misled by rightist elements, with the kind help of the Party and comrades, have sobered up and opened their eyes. At the symposium, they exposed the "arson" activities of rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu in Beijing's opera circles. This aroused great anger among the actors and all artistic cadres present, who expressed their determination to unite closely around the Communist Party and resolutely fight against rightist elements such as Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu to the end.

　　Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng (Zhang Bojun's wife), and others convened two symposiums for opera actors on June 5th and 13th at the CPPCC Cultural Club and the Beijing Hotel, inciting actors to attack the national theater. They also sent their confidants to visit some actors' homes in Zhang Bojun's car to develop organizations, attempting to seize the leadership of the China Peking Opera Theater. Zhang Bojun sent his confidant, Xing Wenxin, to run around and incite some actors to be dissatisfied with the Communist Party before the symposium was held. He also claimed that some actors were obviously hesitant in their speeches at the People's Daily symposium on May 12th and did not say what was in their hearts. It was even more difficult to speak out in the theater. Therefore, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party convened this symposium, hoping that the actors would say what they dared not say, and also indicated that this was instructed by Zhang Bojun. Xing Wenxin once said to an actor that the rectification campaign in the Peking Opera Theater lacked democracy walls, big-character posters, and large-scale struggle meetings, which meant there were problems with the leadership and it was an impregnable fortress. When Li Boqiu personally invited individual actors to dinner at the CPPCC Cultural Club, he said with ulterior motives, "The Communist Party will not be able to continue without a rectification campaign. It's like a volcano, and if you press it down hard, it will erupt, and it will become the Hungarian incident. Therefore, the fire must be sprayed out."

　　When Li Huifang, an actress, exposed the inside story of the symposium convened by Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng, and others at the symposium held by the China Peking Opera Theater, she said that when the old artists first spoke about the issue of art reform at the meeting, the rightist elements saw that it did not suit their wishes, so they passed notes to each other, signaling to shift the "ignition" to the Party's leadership of the China Peking Opera Theater. At that time, some people immediately vilified and attacked the Peking Opera Theater. Some said that the reason why the opera circles across the country were not doing well and there were many shortcomings was due to the China Peking Opera Theater, and the reason why the China Peking Opera Theater was not doing well was because the deputy director of the Party member, Ma Shaobo, was not leading well, which meant that the Communist Party was not leading well. Some even said that the Peking Opera circle could not flourish unless Ma Shaobo was overthrown. Li Boqiu shouted loudly, "Just speak out, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party will support you!" Some people even slandered and said, "The actors of the China Peking Opera Theater have not yet been liberated," "The China Peking Opera Theater is a concentration camp," and "Communist Party members are spies," etc. At that time, the rightist elements present constantly echoed and applauded, repeatedly applauding these "bold speeches."

　　Ye Shengchang, an actor who had been wooed by rightist elements, expressed his deep regret after exposing the various facts of the Zhang-Luo alliance's attack on the Peking Opera circle. He said that he did not know where a "demonic spirit" came from at that time, and all the speeches at the symposium hosted by Li Boqiu and others were distortions of the facts, and he also fabricated slanders such as the Peking Opera Theater having an "iron curtain" and Communist Party members beating people. He said that after that symposium, when Li Boqiu and others intentionally left some people behind for dinner, Zhang Bojun rushed over despite the pain after having a tooth extracted and bowed to everyone as soon as he entered the door, saying that they had worked hard. Li Jiansheng immediately reported the situation of the symposium to him, repeatedly saying that the meeting was a success.

　　Some actors also revealed that at that cocktail party, Li Boqiu thought that the speeches at the symposium that day were "enthusiastic," but unfortunately the number of people was still small, so he discussed on the spot the list of actors to invite to the next symposium, not only top actors, but also grassroots actors. Some actors said, "He who eats the king's food does the king's work," and we told them the names of some actors who were dissatisfied with the theater after eating their food and wine, as targets for the next invitation to the symposium.

　　The actors also successively exposed the situation in which Zhang Bojun commanded his confidants to use methods such as pulling and deceiving to develop organizations and establish strongholds in the China Peking Opera Theater, attempting to seize the leadership of the Communist Party. Zhang Bojun sent Xing Wenxin to visit Ye Shengchang, the lead actor of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," under the guise of learning "Fifteen Strings of Cash," and encouraged him to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Later, he said to him that it would not be effective for you to join alone, and a branch needed to be established. With branches in each troupe, a general branch could be established in the entire theater. Even if the leadership of the Peking Opera Theater could not be overthrown, at least it could be done with branch against branch (referring to the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party against the Communist Party), splitting the court and dividing the spoils equally. Therefore, it was necessary to continue to develop a group of main actors to be effective. He also said, "Old Zhang Bojun personally appointed the Ye brothers (Ye Shenglan, Ye Shengzhang, and Ye Shengchang) to join the organization." Xing Wenxin also clamored, "With Ye Shenglan's reputation, he can be a member of the Municipal Party Committee if he joins the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and he can also be elected to the Central Committee. At that time, Zhang Bojun can recommend Shenglan as the deputy director of the Peking Opera Theater by saying a word in the United Front Work Department." Zhang Bojun also sent his confidants to visit famous actors and old artists in small cars, carrying application forms for joining the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and their published tabloid "Advance News" to lobby and persuade actors to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party as soon as possible. When they were actively developing the organization, they advocated "opening the door to the backward," and included those who were dissatisfied with the theater's leadership in their development plan. They said to some people who had opinions about the Communist Party organization that with the organization, your speeches would be powerful. When the branch was established in the China Peking Opera Theater, you can tell your director that we are not a small group, but a large group, a legitimate political party. Xie Weihan, Zhang Bojun's confidant, also said to the actors that Xiao Changhua and Hao Shouchang were both targets for development. With Lao Xiao and Lao Hao in Beijing and Lao Gai in Shanghai, this meant that we had made achievements in the theater circle.

　　The rightist elements used sweet words and temptations such as awarding "official positions" to develop two party members among the actors of the China Peking Opera Theater. Xing Wenxin taught them some struggle tactics, saying, "You are members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and you should try to gain the trust of the CCP first, so that it will be easier to work in the future. Speaking should be skillful, and when speaking at the meeting, you should separate party members from the Party organization." After the anti-rightist struggle began, some actors realized that they had been fooled. The rightist elements persuaded them in many ways to stabilize them, telling them "not to shrink back in the heated struggle, stand firm and not be deserters," and prevented the actors who had been misled by the rightist elements from turning around and launching a struggle against the rightist elements.

　　The meeting also exposed the vicious conspiracy of the rightist elements to drag old artists into the water. Xing Wenxin went to Xiao Changhua's home twice to mobilize him to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and participate in the symposium they convened, but Xiao Changhua refused. Xiao Shengxuan, Xiao Changhua's son, said angrily about this issue: "The rightist elements saw that my father had prestige and his words had appeal, so they wanted to drag him into their trap. This ambition is vicious." Ye Shengchang also revealed that the reason why the rightist elements pulled Xiao Changhua and Hao Shouchang in was to control the two opera schools in Beijing. The rightist elements also deceived the actors by saying that Premier Zhou went to see Gai Jiaotian only after he joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. In fact, Gai Jiaotian did not join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, which was fabricated by the rightist elements. Zhang Jianming (Little Gai Jiaotian), Gai Jiaotian's son, was very angry after hearing this rumor and sternly refuted it at the meeting, saying: "Premier Zhou has seen my father more than once, which shows the respect of the Party and government leaders for the old artists. The rightist elements want to use my father as a call for them to develop the organization, which is absolutely not allowed. My father often said: My parents gave me life, and the Communist Party knows me. He never said it was the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party!"

　　At the symposium held by the China Peking Opera Theater, the actors rushed to speak. Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Li Shaochun, Ye Shengzhang, Ye Shenglan, Zhang Chunhua, Yun Yanming, Yan Huizhu, Zheng Yiqiu, Fan Junhong, and others also spoke at the meeting. Such meetings are still continuing, and those who participated in the meeting expressed their determination to pursue the rightist elements and sever the claws of right-wing ambitious individuals such as Zhang Bojun伸进戏剧界的魔爪 into the theater world.

    斩断章伯钧伸进戏剧界的魔爪
    中国京剧院揭发右派分子的阴谋活动
    新华社14日讯　新华社记者孙世恺报道：中国京剧院连日来举行四次座谈会，揭发了李伯球等资产阶级右派分子在章伯钧亲自指挥下，积极拉拢演员向国家剧院猖狂进攻的阴谋活动。
    曾被右派分子迷惑的某些演员，在党和同志们亲切的帮助下清醒过来，擦亮了眼睛，在座谈会上揭发了章伯钧、李伯球等右派分子在北京戏曲界“放火”的活动，引起到会的演员及所有艺术干部极大的愤怒，纷纷表示要紧紧团结在共产党的周围，坚决向章伯钧、李伯球等右派分子斗争到底。
    李伯球、李健生（章伯钧的妻子）等6月5日和13日在政协文化俱乐部和北京饭店召开了两次戏曲演员座谈会，煽动演员们向国家剧院进攻，又派出他们的亲信三番五次地坐了章伯钧的小汽车到一些演员家中去发展组织，企图夺取中国京剧院的领导权。章伯钧派出他的亲信邢文鑫在召开座谈会前就到处奔走，煽动一些演员对共产党不满；并宣称说，有些演员在5月12日人民日报的座谈会上发言显然有顾虑，没有把心里话说出来，在剧院内更不好说，所以农工民主党出来召开这个座谈会，希望演员们把不敢说的话都谈出来，还表明这是章伯钧指示的。邢文鑫曾对一位演员说，京剧院整风没有民主墙、大字报和开大会斗争是领导上有问题，是铜墙铁壁。李伯球亲自邀请个别演员到政协文化俱乐部吃饭时，别有用心地说，“共产党不整风不成了，像火山一样，硬按住就得爆发，那就成匈牙利事件，所以一定要把火喷出来。”
    演员李慧芳在中国京剧院举行的座谈会上揭发李伯球、李健生等召开戏曲演员座谈会的内幕时说，开会时老艺人先发言谈到艺术改革问题，右派分子眼看不合他们的心意，就相互递条子示意把“点火”的锋芒转到中国京剧院的党的领导方面。当时，有些人立即对京剧院进行了污蔑和攻击。有的说，全国戏曲界所以搞不好，存在许多缺点，是由于中国京剧院的关系，而中国京剧院没搞好是因为党员的副院长马少波领导不好，也就是共产党领导的不好。有人甚至说，不打倒马少波，京剧界不能大放光明。李伯球大声疾呼：“只管放，有农工民主党给你们作主！”有的人竟然诬蔑说：“中国京剧院的演员还没有解放”，“中国京剧院是集中营”，“共产党员是特务”等。当时，在座的右派分子不断地帮腔喝采，一再为这些“大胆的发言”鼓掌。
    曾经受到右派分子拉拢的演员叶盛长在揭发章罗联盟向京剧界进攻的种种事实后，表示十分痛心地说，我当时不知从哪儿来一股“邪气”，在李伯球等主持的座谈会上的讲话全部是歪曲事实，还无中生有地说出京剧院有“铁幕”，共产党员打人等诬蔑性言论。他说，在那次座谈会后，李伯球等人有意留下一些人请吃饭的时候，章伯钧刚拔完牙也不顾痛地匆忙赶去，一进门就向大家拱手道辛苦。李健生立即向他汇报座谈会的情况，一再表示会开得成功。
    有的演员也揭发说，在那次酒会上，李伯球认为当天的座谈会发言“热烈”，可惜人数还不多，当场就讨论下次座谈会邀请那些演员的名单，不仅要上层演员，也要请基层演员。有的演员说：“吃人嘴短，拿人手短”，我们吃了人家酒饭，也就把一些对剧院不满的演员的名字都告诉了他们，作为下次邀请座谈的对象。
    演员们还相继揭发出章伯钧指挥他的亲信用拉、骗等方法在中国京剧院发展组织建立据点，企图夺取共产党领导的情况。章伯钧派邢文鑫假借学“十五贯”的名义去拜访主演“十五贯”的演员叶盛长，怂恿他参加了农工民主党，以后又对他说，光你一人参加也不起什么作用，需要成立支部，各团有了支部，全院就可成立总支，即使推翻不了京剧院的领导，至少作到以支部对支部（指农工民主党对共产党），分庭抗礼，平分秋色。因此，必须继续发展一批主要演员才起作用。又说：“章伯老亲点叶氏三兄弟
  （即叶盛兰、叶盛章、叶盛长）参加组织。”邢文鑫还扬言说：“以叶盛兰的声望，参加了农工民主党就可当市委委员，又可选上中央委员，那时，章伯钧在统战部说句话就能推荐盛兰当京剧院副院长。”章伯钧又派出他的亲信乘小汽车登门拜访名演员和老艺术家，携带参加农工民主党的申请书和他们出版的小报“前进报”进行游说，劝演员赶快参加农工民主党。他们在积极活动发展组织时，主张“向落后开门”，把对剧院领导不满的人列入他们发展的计划中，他们向一些对共产党组织有意见的人说，有了组织，你们的发言才有力量。在中国京剧院成立支部的时候，可告诉你们的院长，我们不是小集团，是大集团，是合法的政党。章伯钧的亲信谢维汉也对演员们说，萧长华、郝寿臣都是发展的对象，北京有萧老、郝老，上海有盖老，这就是说在戏剧界这一环，我们作出成绩了。
    右派分子用花言巧语和封“官”等诱骗方法在中国京剧院演员中发展了两个党员。邢文鑫就向他们传授一些斗争的策略，他说，“你们是农工民主党党员，应当想法先取得中共的信任，将来工作就好做了。说话要有技巧，在会上发言要把党员和党组织分开。”在反右派斗争开始后，有的演员才觉到上了当。右派分子又多方面劝说安定他们，叫他们“不要在火热的斗争中退缩，站稳立场不能作逃兵”，阻止被右派分子迷惑的演员转过头来向右派分子展开斗争。
    在会上还揭发了右派分子企图拉老艺人下水的恶毒阴谋。邢文鑫曾两次到萧长华家中动员他加入农工民主党和参加他们召开的座谈会，都被萧长华拒绝了。萧长华的儿子萧盛萱谈到这个问题愤怒地说：
  “右派分子看到我父亲有声望，说话有号召力，就想拖下水上他们的圈套，这种野心是恶毒的。”叶盛长还揭发了右派分子所以拉萧长华、郝寿臣是为了控制北京的两个戏曲学校的阴谋。右派分子还哄骗演员说，盖叫天参加农工民主党后，周总理才去看他。事实上，盖叫天并没有参加农工民主党，是右派分子捏造的。盖叫天的儿子张剑鸣（小盖叫天）听到这个谰言后非常气愤，在会上严正地驳斥说：“周总理看我父亲不止一次，说明党和政府领导同志对老艺术家的尊敬，右派分子想利用我父亲作为他们发展组织的号召是决不容许的。我的父亲经常说：生我者父母，知我者是共产党，从没说过是农工民主党呀！”
    在中国京剧院召开的座谈会上，演员们都争先恐后地发言。在会上发言的还有田汉、梅兰芳、李少春、叶盛章、叶盛兰、张春华、云燕铭、言慧珠、郑亦秋、范钧宏等。这样的会还在继续进行，参加会的人都表示决心追击右派分子，斩断章伯钧等右派野心家伸进戏剧界的魔爪。
