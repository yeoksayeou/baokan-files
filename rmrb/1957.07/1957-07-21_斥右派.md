Denouncing the Rightists
Xiao Changhua

    Some time ago, when I heard the various anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of the right-wing elements, I felt very angry. Later, after listening to Premier Zhou's report on the government's work regarding the great achievements of socialist construction, I was so moved that I shed tears. I also want to speak my mind and refute the right-wing fallacies.

    I am eighty years old this year, and I started learning opera at the age of ten. I have sung "Su San Starts Her Journey" for decades. In this opera, I play Chong Gongdao, and every time I hear Su San sing, "My parents were too cruel, they shouldn't have sold their daughter into a brothel," I feel a pang of sadness in my heart. I have wondered, when did brothels begin? Later, someone told me about the Twenty-Four Histories, and I learned that during the time of the Warring States, Duke Huan of Qi dominated the other feudal lords and unified the world. He appointed Guan Zhong as his prime minister, and they established "guest wives and road prostitutes," setting up three hundred places for musical performers, "specially housing beautiful women, spending their days on makeup and rouge, striving to be seductive and charming, to entice merchants from various countries, and collect their 'nightly union' fees to enrich the state." From the Warring States period to the eve of liberation, for thousands of years, countless respectable women were harmed in the bitter sea of prostitution. Since the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, didn't every dynasty produce some great sages and virtuous men? Why did this morally corrupting and inhuman thing continue from generation to generation? The Communist Party came, and within a few years, prostitution was eliminated throughout the country. Isn't this a great act of kindness and virtue, an unprecedented feat in human history?!

    As everyone knows, in our "Peking Opera" profession, many people used to smoke opium. I want to talk about opium. We will never forget the Opium War in 1840, which led to the ceding of land and payment of indemnities. At that time, the Qing Dynasty was ruled by Emperor Daoguang, and the political situation was extremely dark and corrupt, the economy was depleted, and the people's lives were impoverished to the extreme. In order to satisfy its desire to obtain high profits, British imperialism adopted the method of armed opium smuggling to open the door to China, importing large quantities of opium into China, poisoning the Chinese people, and expanding its market in China. After opium was imported, Japan also imported "white powder," "heroin" and other drugs, making addicts look emaciated and ghost-like. Since liberation, opium has also disappeared. People with opium addiction have gradually become healthy. Take our Peking Opera profession as an example. In the past, many people in our profession died from opium addiction. If the Communist Party hadn't come, I'm afraid some famous actors would still be destitute and addicted to opium! This not only saved the artists, but also saved the art.

    Based on these two things alone, let me ask these right-wing elements, do you know about these things? Is this the Communist Party's merit? Who else but the Communist Party could have done it?

    I play the clown role. In the old society, the small painted face was looked down upon, especially when I reached my age, no one paid attention to me. After liberation, I have always been respected by the government and the people. I am now the vice president of the Chinese Opera School. Although I am the vice president, Principal Yan Yong and Vice Principal Shi Ruoxu still seek my opinion on many artistic matters. During a period when I was ill, they often came to my home to discuss the work of the school. The right-wing elements say in general terms that non-Party members have positions but no power, which is undermining the unity between the Party and non-Party members.

    From the article published in the People's Daily on the 10th of this month about how the right-wing elements were setting fires in the Peking Opera circles, I further realized the tricks of the right-wing elements. I hope that comrades in the Peking Opera circles will be vigilant and not be fooled by the right-wing elements. We must resolutely support the Communist Party, always follow Chairman Mao, and dedicate ourselves to the people's opera cause. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be nothing. We will never agree to anyone who tries to undermine our unity and cause.

    斥右派
    萧长华
    前些日子，当我听到右派分子的种种反党反社会主义谬论的时候，感到十分愤怒；以后听了周总理政府工作报告中关于社会主义建设的丰功伟绩，使我感动的落了眼泪。我也要把心里的话儿说出来，反驳右派谬论。
    我今年八十岁了，十岁就学戏，我唱了几十年“苏三起解”。在这出戏里，我饰崇公道，每逢听苏三唱到“爹娘作事心太狠，不该将女卖入娼门”的时候，心头止不住一阵酸痛。我曾想过，打从什么时候起有了妓院呢？以后有人给我讲二十四史，知道列国齐桓公霸诸侯一匡天下，用管仲为相，他们兴得客妻路妓，设立了三百处乐户，“专居美妇，日事颜华脂粉，务为妖淫娇媚，以迷各国之商贾，征其夜合之资，以足国用”。从列国到解放前夕，几千年间，在娼妓的苦海中不知伤害了多少良家妇女。从东周以来，那一朝代也出几位大圣大贤吧，为什么这种伤风败俗、惨绝人寰的事依然代代相继呢？共产党来了，几年之内，妓女在全国范围内取消了，这种大恩大德，不是人类史上的空前创举吗？！
    大家知道，咱们“梨园”行中，从前抽大烟的人是很多的。我想谈谈鸦片的事。公元1840年鸦片战争割地赔款的事，咱们都不会忘吧。当时是在清道光皇帝统治时期，这时在政治上非常黑暗腐败，经济上是财尽民穷，人民生活贫困达于极点，而英帝国主义为了满足其获得高额利润的欲望，便采取了鸦片武装走私的办法来打开中国的大门，大量向中国输入鸦片，毒害中国人民，扩大它在中国的市场。鸦片输入以后，日本又输入“白面”，“海洛英”等毒品，弄得成瘾的人面黄肌瘦，如鬼一般。自从解放后，鸦片也绝迹了。有烟瘾的人也逐渐健康起来了。就拿我们梨园行来说吧，过去死在鸦片瘾的人大有人在，如果不是共产党来了，恐怕还会有些名演员潦倒在烟瘾之中呢！这不但挽救了艺人，也挽救了艺术。
    就以上这两件事来问问这些右派分子，你们知道不知道？这是不是共产党的功德？除了共产党谁能办到？
    我是唱丑角的，在旧社会里，小花脸是被人瞧不起的，尤其到了我这般年纪，早就无人理睬了。解放后，我却一直受到政府与人民的尊敬。我现在是中国戏曲学校的副校长。我虽然是副校长，但有关艺术上的许多事情晏甬校长、史若虚副校长都要征求我的同意。在我患病的一个时期，他们还经常到我家里来研究学校的工作。右派分子笼统地说非党员有职无权，这是破坏党与非党的团结。
    从本月10日人民日报刊载右派分子怎样在京剧界放火一文，我进一步认识到右派分子的鬼把戏。希望京剧界的同志们警惕吧，不要上了右派分子的当。我们要坚决拥护共产党，永远跟着毛主席，为人民的戏曲事业鞠躬尽瘁。没有共产党领导就没有一切，谁要破坏我们的团结和事业，我们坚决不答应。
