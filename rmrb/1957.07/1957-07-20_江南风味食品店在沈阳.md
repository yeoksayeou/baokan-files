    A Southern Goods store was recently established at the southern end of Taiyuan Street, a bustling area of Shenyang. This store, filled with the flavor of Jiangnan, is stocked with a diverse array of foods: Shanghai pork floss, spiced broad beans, Nanjing salted duck, Zhenjiang vinegar, Hangzhou torreya nuts, walnuts, Guangzhou fermented bean curd, Jinhua ham, Zhejiang colored eggs, Shaoxing preserved vegetables, Sichuan white fungus, Hunan fermented soybeans, and more than 300 other varieties. The staff managing this store are mostly from the South.

    In recent years, with the development of economic and cultural construction in Shenyang, many senior intellectuals, engineers, technicians, and a large number of workers have been transferred from the South. The Northeastern style pastries and candies are not very suitable for their tastes. Now, in this store, they can taste the flavors of their long-missed hometown, which is a great pleasure. However, it is a pity that the variety is still somewhat limited. According to the feedback from these Southerners, they hope that in addition to running such Southern Goods stores, more restaurants, snack bars, and fashion stores that cater to Southern tastes should be established. If that could be done, it would be even more ideal.

### 江南风味食品店在沈阳

    江南风味食品店在沈阳
    在沈阳繁华的太原街的南头，不久前新建立了一座南货商店。这个充满江南风味的商店里，摆满着异味多样的食品：上海猪肉松、五香豆、南京板鸭、镇江陈醋、杭州香榧、小胡桃、广州腐乳、金华火腿、浙江彩蛋、绍兴霉干菜，四川银耳、湖南豆豉等三百多种。在这个商店经营南货的人员大部是南方人。
    沈阳这几年来，随着经济文化建设的开展，从南方调来了许多高级知识分子、工程技术人员和大批职工，东北的一些点心、糖果不很适合他们的口味，现在在这个商店里，就可以尝到别之已久的家乡味，这是一个很大的愉快，但可惜的是品种还嫌少些。据这些南方人的反映，他们希望除了办这样的南货商店外，还需多设一些适应南方口味的饭馆、小吃店、时装店等，如果能够这样那就更为理想了。
