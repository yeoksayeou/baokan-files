Concentrated Rainfall in the Yangtze and Huai River Basins
Waterlogged Areas are Being Drained

(Reported by this newspaper) In early July, rainfall was concentrated in some areas of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, causing river levels to rise. The Nihewa flood storage area of the Huai River has been opened for flood diversion.

From June 30th to July 4th, continuous heavy rain fell between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, south of the Yangtze River's main stream, and in northern Zhejiang Province, with high intensity. Southern Jiangsu generally received over 200 millimeters of rainfall, with Yixing in the Taihu Lake area receiving the most, at 540 millimeters. Northern Zhejiang received between 200 and 300 millimeters of rainfall. As a result, waterlogging occurred in southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, affecting over 5 million mu of farmland. These areas are working day and night to drain the water and protect the seedlings.

From July 2nd to 3rd, the heavy rain center in Anhui Province was in the Jiangnan mountainous area, around Jingxian and Xuancheng, with about 300 millimeters of rainfall. The Shuiyang, Langchuan, Qingyi, Qiupu, and Datong Rivers all saw their water levels rise sharply. Embankments in Langxi and Guichi counties breached, flooding over 90,000 mu of land.

In the Yangtze River basin, the Jialing River's Zhaohua station, the Fujiang River's Taihezhen station, and the Yangtze River's main stream at Qingxichang, Wushan, and Huarong all experienced flood peaks on the 6th and 7th, exceeding the warning water levels.

In the Huai River basin on the 6th, the highest water level at the Shahe River's Yexian station was 87.8 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 1.8 meters. The Hongru River's Xiangcheng water level was 81.7 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 2.11 meters. The Nihewa flood storage area was opened for flood diversion on the 7th, reducing the flood peak transmitted downstream to Luohe and Zhoukou, but it did not exceed the guaranteed water level. All stations upstream of the Yi and Shu Rivers also experienced flood peaks that exceeded the warning water levels. (Wu Baotong)

    本报讯　7月上旬长江、淮河局部地区雨量集中，河水上涨，淮河泥河洼蓄洪区已开闸分洪。
    6月30日起到7月4日止，江、淮之间、长江下游干流以南及浙江北部地区，连续下了暴雨，强度很大。江苏南部一般降雨二百多公厘，以太湖地区的宜兴降雨五百四十公厘为最大。浙江北部降雨二至三百公厘之间。因此，苏南、浙北发生了渍涝。渍涝的农田达五百多万亩。这些地区正在日夜排涝保苗。
    7月2日到3日，安徽省暴雨中心在江南山区，泾县、宣城一带，降雨三百公厘左右。水阳、郎川、青弋、秋浦、大通各河水位猛涨，郎溪、贵池两县决圩淹地九万多亩。
    长江流域的嘉陵江昭化站、涪江太和镇站及长江干流的清溪场、巫山、华容于6、7日出现洪峰，均超过警戒水位。
    淮河流域在6日，沙河叶县最高水位八十七点八公尺，超过保证水位一点八公尺。洪汝河项城水位八十一点七公尺，超过保证水位二点一一公尺。泥河洼蓄洪区7日开闸分洪，削减后的洪峰下传至漯河、周口，但未超过保证水位。沂沭河上游各站都出现洪峰也超过警戒水位。　（吴宝通）
