　　An Attack on Human Morality
　　Xu Nuo
    After reading the tragic news on the second page of the June 25th "People's Daily" about a township head in Guantao County, Shandong, whose entire family of seven was murdered by counter-revolutionaries, what were your thoughts when you turned to the third page and read the "What Words" column, which reprinted the lofty opinions of Wang Changfeng, an assistant instructor in the Department of Sanitary Engineering at Tongji University?

    According to Wang Changfeng's lofty opinions, "Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is an attack on human morality." Then, what should we consider the heinous and inhumane crimes of counter-revolutionaries like those in Guantao? Should we consider that a defense of human morality? If we don't eliminate such wicked counter-revolutionaries, what guarantee is there for the people's lives and property? How can the socialist revolution and socialist construction proceed smoothly? Wang Changfeng's argument is truly an attack on human morality.

    There's no need to trace back the more than thirty years of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese people's revolution, or the eight years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the many evil deeds done by internal and external counter-revolutionary forces in China, and how many good people they killed. People only need to smell the scent of the threatening letters that many people have received recently, listen to the explosions in the dormitory of the Party Committee Secretary of Beijing Medical College, and look at the knife skills of the counter-revolutionaries in Guantao (don't forget, these all happened after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries!), isn't the "moral" face of the counter-revolutionaries obviously ferocious? If someone wasn't standing on the same side as the counter-revolutionaries, who would defend their crimes and wantonly slander the people's just suppression movement!

    What is "human morality"? In a society where classes have not been completely eliminated, there is only morality that represents the interests of a certain class; there is no such thing as supra-class morality. What the enemies of the people consider moral behavior is precisely what the people consider immoral. The reverse is also true. Not only is this the case now, but even in the future when class differences are finally eliminated in the world, the banner of morality will never become a fig leaf and shield for bad people and bad deeds.

### 对人类道德的进攻

    对人类道德的进攻
  　许诺
    当你从6月25日的“人民日报”第二版上读过山东馆陶县一乡长全家被反革命分子杀害七口的惨讯后，再翻到第三版看了“什么话”一栏里转载的同济大学卫生工程系助教汪长风的高论时，作何感想？
    据汪长风的高论，“肃反是对人类道德的进攻”。那么，像馆陶反革命分子这样穷凶极恶、惨无人道的罪行，该算什么呢？难道这倒算是对人类道德的保卫吗？假如对这类无恶不作的反革命分子不加以肃清，人民的生命财产还有什么保障？社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业怎么能够顺利进行？汪长风这种议论，才真是对人类道德的进攻。
    用不着追溯中国共产党领导中国人民革命三十多年来，或者是中华人民共和国成立八年来，内外反革命势力在中国作了多少坏事，杀害了多少好人，人们只要嗅一嗅近来好些人接到的恐吓信的气味，听一听北京医学院党委书记宿舍里的爆炸声，看一看馆陶反革命分子的刀法（不要忘记，这都是发生在肃反运动以后的事呀！），反革命分子的“道德”面貌是何等的凶恶，不是昭然若揭了吗？要不是和反革命分子站在一个立场上的人，谁还能为他们的罪恶作辩护，对人民正义的肃反运动肆意诬蔑！
    什么叫“人类道德”？在阶级还没有最后消灭的社会里，只有代表一定阶级利益的道德，谈不到有什么超阶级的道德。人民的敌人认为道德的行为，就正是人民认为不道德的行为。反过来说，也是一样。不但现在如此，即使在将来世界上最后消灭了阶级的差别，道德的旗帜，也永远不会成为坏人坏事的遮羞布和挡箭牌。
