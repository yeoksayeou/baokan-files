    Singing of Lugou Bridge
    Tian Han
    Time flies so fast; it has been exactly twenty years from 1937 to this year. Young people in their twenties are living free and happy lives, slowly fading away and forgetting this not-so-distant story of national independence and bloody battles with the enemy. As a result, some people listen to the instigation of reactionaries, not knowing that without the Communist Party, there would be no true New China, and even believe that today is not as good as before. They really don't know what kind of lives people lived before!
    On July 3rd, we took half a day, along with the sick An'e, People's Daily comrade Zhu Shulan, Yue Opera actor Chen Peng, and others, to revisit Lugou Bridge, took a few photos, and came back to write three sets of five-character ancient poems. I don't know if this kind of poetry form can convey our feelings to some extent?

    I
    The car passes Mosquito Mountain, the scorching sun is still like a tiger. The mountainside breaks along the road, and the green trees dance in the wind. Remnant碉 stands tall among the abundant grass, with the graves of martyrs in between. It seems that twenty years ago, our army resisted the Japanese invaders: the mountain side was practicing, and enemy bullets suddenly rained down, wanting to enter Wanping again, using the excuse of searching for soldiers. The defenders refused to let them in, and the Japanese invaders actually used force, only thinking that with one cannon shot, "China" would surely submit, though the rulers were contemptible, the spirit of the people could not be insulted. Everyone forgot about life and death, regardless of whether weapons were good or bad. Our Party advocated resistance, uniting four hundred and fifty million people. The fire on Lugou Bridge spread like wildfire, eventually trapping the enemy, wanting to pull out but already reaching their bellies. To this day, the stone lions still stand proudly on the bridge pillars, their faces are mostly damaged, but their loyalty is eternal.

    II
    I still remember when the cannons roared, I was in Nanjing. Hearing that we were going to resist Japan, I was so happy that I forgot myself. Determined to write a play, I finished a hundred pages a day, with Bao Luo playing the main character, directed by Hong Shen. The effect was brilliant, pointing and moving like the firing of cannons. Those who fell before were followed by those who came after, killing the enemy regardless of death. The Dahua New Theater was like being on the Lugou River.
    Among the audience at that time, there were exactly the Seven Gentlemen. Mr. Heng stroked his long beard, his face full of joy at the play. He said that his lifelong desire was to resist Japan. Gong Pu also had a beautiful beard, and talked to me endlessly: "I love to sing the Volunteer March, as I did in prison." There was also Wang Zaoshi, and Zhang Naiqi, who were also generous at that time, quite like patriots, but how could it be that after twenty years, they have become so mean and flattering!

    III
    Driving to visit Cui Village, returning via Zhanggezhuang. Men use new farm tools, women wear colorful clothes. Crops are growing vigorously, and elm and willow trees form rows. Chickens and pigs gather behind the cooperative, and cattle and sheep walk in front of it. Children return from school, singing native tunes. Hands dance and feet stomp, schoolbags falling by the roadside. Who knows that twenty years ago, this place was a battlefield, iron hooves trampled on crops, cannons destroyed houses, brothers lost brothers, and children cried for their parents? And before liberation, the river water reached the roofs, with no harvest of grain and livestock suffering along with it. The Guanting Reservoir was built, becoming the natural king, storing and releasing at will, with no end to the happiness and leisure. Returning to Lugou Bridge, the motorcade stretches long. The Taihang Mountains are majestic, and the Lugou River flows mightily. In the past, people left Beijing, treading on the remaining frost under the moonlight. We commemorate the traces of war, with the setting sun shining through the car window, to wish the farmers, the past must not be forgotten, intensify production and create a paradise.

    歌芦沟桥
    田汉
    日子过得极快，从1937年到今年整整二十年了。二十来岁的青年人，过着自由幸福的生活，慢慢把这一为民族独立与敌人血肉相搏的不远的故事淡焉忘去了，以致还有一部分人听信反动派挑拨，不知道没有共产党就真正没有新中国，甚至以为今日反不及以前，他真不知以前的人过的是什么日子！
    7月3日我们抽出半天工夫跟病中的安娥，人民日报的朱树兰同志，越剧院陈鹏同志等，重访芦沟桥，拍了几张照片，回来写了三组五古，不知道这样的诗形，也多少传达了我们的感情没有？
    一
    车过蚊子山，骄阳尚如虎。山腰随路断，碧树因风舞。残碉矗丰草，中有烈士墓。仿佛廾年前，我军抗日虏：山边方演习，敌弹忽如雨，又要入宛平，托言搜卒伍。守者拒不纳，日寇竟动武，只道炮一响，“支那”首必俯，肉食者虽鄙，民气不可侮。人人忘死生，武器无良窳。我党主抗战，团结四亿五。芦沟桥上火，炎炎蔓全土，终使敌泥足，欲拔已及肚。至今石狮子，昂然据桥柱，面目多破损，忠烈自千古。
    二
    犹忆炮响时，我羁金陵市。听说要抗日，欢喜忘所以。决心写剧本，一日尽百纸，保罗演主角，导演洪深氏。效果黄粲华，指动炮火起。前仆后者继，杀敌不顾死。大华新剧场，如临芦沟水。
    当时观众中，恰有七君子。衡老抚长须，对剧色然喜。以谓平生心，抗日而已矣。公朴亦美髯，与我谈未已：“爱唱义勇曲，当我在狱里。”亦有王造时，以及章乃器，当时亦慷慨，颇类爱国士，奈何二十年，鄙佞竟至此！
    三
    驱车访崔村，归经张各庄。男使新农具，女着花衣裳。庄稼正茁壮，榆柳自成行。社后聚鸡豚，社前走牛羊。儿童放学归，口唱自来腔。手舞并足蹈，书包落道傍。哪知廾年前，此地是战场，铁蹄踏庄稼，炮火毁土房，哥哥失兄弟，儿女哭爹娘？还有解放前，河水齐屋梁，颗粒既无收，牲畜并遭殃，官厅水库成，乃作自然王。贮放随人意，康乐殊未央。重上芦沟桥，车队行列长。太行山峨峨，芦沟水汤汤。昔人辞京去，戴月踏残霜。我们吊战迹，车窗射夕阳，为祝庄稼人，前事不可忘，加紧搞生产，创造极乐乡。
