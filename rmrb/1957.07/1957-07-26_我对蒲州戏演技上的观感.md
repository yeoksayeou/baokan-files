Everyone knows that song, dance, recitation (dialogue), and instrumental music are the four major components of Chinese opera. "Poetry," "history," and "events" are also the three mixed elements of Chinese opera. Puzhou Opera (Puzhou Bangzi Tune), like other ancient opera genres, preserves its inherited traditional characteristics in this respect. In many plays, "song is used to express the meaning" and dance is used to represent the form," artistically exaggerating the depth of life that the characters should have, expressing it very beautifully and naturally. When performed at the climax, it gives people a sense of open-mindedness.

Indeed, Puzhou Bangzi Tune is a relatively ancient opera genre, preserving three or four hundred old plays and many older traditional performance techniques. All the "stroking the beard," "adjusting the crown," "raising the robe," "flicking the sleeves," as well as "feather work," "beard work," "whip work," "wing work," "step work," "stilt work," "flag work," "boot work" ...etc., are all transformed into very beautiful artistic dance forms in conjunction with their hand gestures, eyesight, body movements, after permeating a certain life emotion.

Let's take the main characters who came to Beijing for this performance as an example: "Stilt work" was the unique skill of the old artist Wang Cuncai, but unfortunately, he passed away before coming to Beijing. It is said that his stilt skills were no less than those of the old Thirteenth Dan (Hongdong Hou Junshan), who was "famous throughout the capital" in his early years. Comrade Yan Fengchun has improved the "hat wing work," and it has had new developments. In plays such as "Releasing the Meal," "Killing the Courier," and "Loyal and Righteous Knight," many "hat wing work" are interspersed, which is greatly appreciated by the audience. Comrade Wang Xiulan is a rising star in the Puzhou opera female roles. In the plays "Hiding the Boat," "Honeymoon Chamber," "Bright Moon Pearl," "Yan Yan," and "Hongniang," the characterizations are different in each play. In her performance, the "diction, emotion, sound waves" and "inner emotions" have many thought-provoking aspects. As for Comrade Zhang Qingkui, he became famous in the opera world at the age of thirteen and is often called "Thirteenth Red." He is indeed a very outstanding role. I think his performances in plays such as "Tearing Up the Letter," "Hanging the Belt at the Palace Gate," and "Three Family Store" seem to have approached the stage of artistic maturity, regardless of posture, action, or expression. In addition to Peking Opera, Yang Hushan can also be called an outstanding face role in local operas. "Jiujiang Estuary," "?Wax Temple," "Tongtian Rhinoceros," and "Gifting a Silk Robe" are his signature plays. Comrade Xiao Yuelai, although he is a young male role in Puzhou opera, he is also good at Guan Gong plays such as "Passing Five Passes."

According to some comrades who study the history of Chinese opera, since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Puzhou Bangzi Tune in Beijing has been called "Western Opera," "Western Tune," "Bangzi Tune," "Gou Tune," "Shanxi Bangzi," "Shanxi-Shaanxi Bangzi," etc., until after Guo Baochen (Yuan'er Hong) and Hou Junshan (Thirteenth Dan) (late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China), it gradually disappeared in the capital. The Bangzi Tune sung by Guo and Hou was "High-Pitched Puzhou Bangzi" (mixed with Yanbei sound, Zhangjiakou sound, and Zhili local tune), which of course has the difference of "different tunes with the same skill" from today's Puzhou Bangzi Tune.

Therefore, I feel that this opera genre is worth recommending. It may preserve many traditional excellent performance methods and techniques since the Yuan Dynasty, which can be appreciated and studied by the public, especially by comrades in the opera field.

    我对蒲州戏演技上的观感
    邓初民
    谁也知道，歌、舞、诵（道白）、奏，是中国戏曲的四大组成部分。是“诗”，是“史”，是“事”，也成为中国戏曲的三大混合要素。蒲州戏（蒲州梆子腔）和其他几个古老的剧种一样，在这点上是保存了它自己继承来的传统特色的。在许多戏中，都是“歌以称之”（称其意）舞以象之（象其形）的从剧中人应有之生活深度，予以艺术夸张，表现得非常美妙自然。演到筋节处，会使人有一种神情开阔的感受。
    的确，蒲州梆子腔是个比较古老的剧种，保存了三四百本古老的剧目，也保存了不少的较古老一些的传统表演技术。所有“捋须”、“弹冠”、“提袍”、“拂袖”，以及“翎子工”、“髯子工”、“鞭子工”、“翅子工”、“步工”、“跷工”、“幡工”、“靴子工”……等等，无一不是配合着他们的手式、眼力、身段，在渗透了一定的生活感情之后而变为很优美的艺术舞蹈形式的。
    就拿这次来京演出的几个主要角色谈吧：“跷工”，是老艺人王存才的绝技，可惜在未来京前就与世长辞了。据说他的跷技，并不在早年“名震京国”的老十三旦（洪洞侯俊山）以下。“帽翅工”经阎逢春同志改进又有了新的发展。“放饭”、“杀驿”、“忠义侠”等剧中，类多“帽翅工”参差其间，获得观众格外赞赏。王秀兰同志，系蒲剧旦角中后起之秀。她在“藏舟”、“洞房”、“明月珠”、“燕燕”与“红娘”几出戏中，对人物性格的刻划，每个戏各有不同。她在表演上“词情声浪”与“内心情感”有许多地方耐人寻味。至于张庆奎同志因十三岁名噪歌坛，艺名多呼之为“十三红”。他的确是个很优秀的角色。我认为他的“拆书”、“宫门挂带”和“三家店”等戏的演出，无论身架、动作、表情，似乎都已接近到艺术上熟透的阶段。花脸除京剧外，在地方剧中，杨虎山同志也称得起突出的一个，“九江口”、“?蜡庙”、“通天犀”、“赠绨袍”，都是他的拿手好戏。筱月来同志，虽然是个蒲剧小生，但他对“出五关”等关公戏也有所擅长。
    据某些研究中国戏曲史的同志们谈，明清以来，蒲州梆子腔在北京曾称之为“西部”、“西腔”、“梆子腔”、“勾腔”、“山西梆子”、“山陕梆子”等等，直至郭宝臣（元儿红）侯俊山（十三旦）以后（清末民国初）才渐次绝响于京师。郭与侯所唱的梆子腔，系“高调蒲州梆子”（参合雁北音、张家口音与直隶土调混合而成），当然与今天的蒲州梆子腔有“同工异曲”的差别。
    因此，我感到这个剧种是值得推荐的，它可能保存着自元曲以来的许多传统优秀表演手法与技巧，可供大众欣赏和研究，尤其是戏曲界同志们的欣赏和研究。
