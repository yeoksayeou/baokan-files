Scientific Undertakings Must Never Deviate from the Socialist Path
Chen Yuan

The rightists, based on subjective judgments and erroneous assessments of the situation, were presumptuously "designing" in their "political design institute." On June 9th, their "Opinions on Scientific System Issues" were published, and on June 10th, the "Suggestions on the Leadership System of Higher Education Institutions" "design" was completed. It is said that this "is just the beginning of this new way of working," and in the future, they will continue to "design" on "central issues related to national policies in each period or each stage," and then "from design to construction," gradually manage it to achieve their attempt to "replace" the leadership of the Party.

However, "once the lid is lifted," the truth is not difficult to see. The so-called several opinions on the scientific system are essentially aimed at fundamentally changing the socialist nature of our country's scientific work. I completely agree with President Guo Moruo's analysis of those opinions in "Refuting an Anti-Socialist Scientific Program." This is a scientific analysis and a powerful counterattack against the rightists' offensive in the scientific community.

A large proportion of the old intellectuals did not have the opportunity to come into contact with Marxism in the past. After liberation, they began to study Marxist theory, and through their specialized research, they gradually found the truth. They saw and personally participated in the socialist transformation and socialist construction. Faced with this great cause, their ideological understanding was greatly influenced, and they actively and consciously carried out self-transformation, gradually changing their old standpoints and accepting the ideology of the working class. Therefore, many friends in intellectual circles have criticized the purely technical viewpoint that ignores politics for several years, changed their past attitude of pursuing scholarship for the sake of scholarship and research for the sake of research, and have gradually abandoned the attitude of research that is divorced from reality and practice.

In the past, many scientists explored a very tortuous and arduous path on their own without leadership, direction, or planning. Sometimes the results were half as effective, sometimes they had to give up halfway, and sometimes because everyone was not connected, they researched the same topic, dispersing their strength and wasting their energy, while at the same time, there were many "gaps" that no one cared about. Today, not only is there unified academic leadership, pointing out a clear direction for scientists, but some people have also personally participated in the formulation of the national science plan, and then work together with everyone to carry out scientific research according to the plan.

In the past, the road was rugged and difficult to travel. Social pressure caused many scientists to encounter difficulties and obstacles, and they had no choice but to give up scientific research. Many patriotic intellectuals actively tried to do something beneficial for the country, hoping to contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood, but in fact, they often could not achieve their good wishes. At that time, the country had no real construction, so it was difficult to talk about meeting the needs of national construction.

Now, we not only have unified leadership, a correct direction, long-term plans, and good conditions, but scientists are also respected, cared for, and trusted by the Party and the government. They have transformed their thinking and corrected their research attitude. Our work and research are all adapted to the needs of national construction and linked to the interests of the whole people, serving socialist construction. This is what all patriotic scientists have long hoped for, what is not easily obtained, and what they are unwilling to change. Especially scientists who have long experienced the loose, individual, and anarchic state of scientific research cannot tolerate those "opinions" that change the socialist nature!

The rightist gentlemen want to drag us backward in scientific undertakings. Politically, they attempt to seize the Party's leadership over scientific work, and ideologically, they want to abolish Marxism. They are prepared to disrupt the science plan and guide scientists away from the socialist path. They advocate not having unified academic leadership, not having our "locomotive." This undoubtedly wants to guide scientific work onto the capitalist system track. They are not advocating not having a locomotive, but wanting to replace it with a bourgeois rightist locomotive, ready to drag the scientific undertaking backward. This is the question of whether we want socialism or not, and it concerns whether we want to advance or retreat. We cannot concede on such fundamental issues!

In order to achieve their conspiracy to abolish Marxism as a guiding ideology, the bourgeois rightists also put forward the opinion of "restoring" bourgeois social science. Social science has a clear class nature, and bourgeois social science serves the interests of the bourgeoisie. Their call to "restore" bourgeois social science is actually to negate Marxism and to replace the leadership of the working class with the leadership of the bourgeoisie. We are dialectical materialists, we want to take the socialist road, should we first develop idealism? Can we, who are taking the socialist road, accept the rampant spread of bourgeois idealist ideas?

We are not saying that we do not want sociology, political science, and law, but we want Marxist sociology, economics, and law. We want sociology, economics, and law that do not violate the laws of social development, do not hinder the progress of history, and serve the interests of the working people and the interests of the working class. Comrade Hu Sheng said it well: "Our attitude towards bourgeois social science is not simply to abolish it, but it must be negated in principle." Our "Hundred Flowers Bloom" is put forward on the basis of socialist society and is put forward because we recognize that various contradictions still exist in socialist society. Without the leadership of the Party and the socialist road, there is no way to talk about "Hundred Flowers Bloom." In fact, if the bourgeois rightists gain a ruling position, then there will be no freedom for Marxism at all, let alone free debate?

It should be said that among us, including myself, there are still some people who are not familiar with or are not good at using Marxism to do research work and handle and observe things. But we have always been fighting against various non-Marxist ideas under the guidance of Marxist thought. This time, we must resolutely draw a clear ideological line with the rightists, and at the same time, gradually eliminate the non-proletarian ideas in our own minds, strengthen ideological transformation, improve our Marxist level, and further develop Marxist social science in the struggle. Our scientific undertakings must never deviate from the socialist path.

    科学事业决不能离开社会主义道路
    陈垣
    右派分子们凭主观的论断，作出对形势的错误估计，在他们的“政治设计院”里狂妄地“设计”起来。6月9日他们的“科学体制问题”发表，6月10日“高等学校领导体制建议”“设计”完成。据说这“还只是这一新的工作方式方法的开端”，今后还要在“每一时期或每一阶段，就有关国家方针政策的中心问题”，继续“设计”，然后要“从设计到施工”，逐步的管理起来，以达其对党的领导“取而代之”的企图。
    但是“揭开盖子”，真象不难大白，所谓有关科学体制的几点意见，实质就是要从根本上改变我国科学工作的社会主义性质。我完全同意郭沫若院长在“驳斥一个反社会主义的科学纲领”中对那些意见的分析，这是一个科学的分析，是对右派在科学界进攻的有力回击。
    旧的知识分子，很大部分在过去是没有机会接触马克思主义的，解放后，开始学习了马克思主义的理论，他们通过自己所研究的专业，逐渐找到了真理。他们看到并亲手参加了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，在这伟大事业的面前，思想认识上受到非常巨大的影响，积极自觉的进行着自我改造，逐渐改变着旧的立场，接受了工人阶级的思想。因此许多知识界的朋友们，几年来都批判了不问政治的单纯技术观点，改变了过去为学术而学术，为研究而研究的态度，已经逐渐放弃了那种脱离现实、脱离实际的研究态度。
    过去很多科学家在没有领导、没有方向、没有计划的情况下，自己摸索着走过非常曲折艰苦的道路。有时是事倍功半，有时则不得不半途而废，有时因大家没有联系，同研究了一个题目，力量分散，精力浪费，而同时却又有不少“缺门”，无人过问。今天不但有了学术的统一领导，为科学家们指出明确的方向，而且有些人还亲自参加了国家的科学规划的制定，然后和大家一起共同按着规划进行科学研究。
    过去的道路崎岖难走，社会的压力使许多科学家遇到困难和阻碍，无可奈何地放弃了科学研究工作。而很多爱国的知识分子，积极努力的想为国家作些有益的事情，希望能有助于国计民生，而事实上往往不能达到自己善良的愿望，当时国家也无所谓真正的建设，自难谈到什么符合国家建设的需要。
    现在我们不但有了统一领导，有了正确方向，有了长远计划，有了良好条件，而且科学家们也都得到党和政府的尊重、爱护与信任，改造了思想，端正了研究态度。我们的工作和研究都是适应着国家建设需要，和全民的利益连系在一起，为社会主义建设服务的。这是一切爱国的科学家所长久希望着的，所不易得来的，所不愿改变的。尤其是长期经历过科学研究工作的散漫、单干、无政府状态的科学家们，对那些改变社会主义性质的“意见”更是不能容忍的！
    右派先生们在科学事业上，要拉着我们往后退。在政治上他们企图夺取党对科学工作的领导权，在思想上要取消马克思主义。他们准备打乱科学规划，引导科学家们离开社会主义的道路。他们主张不要统一的学术领导，不要我们的“火车头”，这无疑就是要想把科学工作引导到资本主义制度轨道上。他们不是主张不要火车头，而是想换上一个资产阶级右派分子的火车头，准备拖着科学事业开倒车。这是我们要不要社会主义的问题，这是关系着我们要前进还是后退的问题。这样根本性的问题，我们丝毫也不能让步！
    资产阶级右派分子为了达到他们取消马克思主义作指导思想的阴谋，他们还提出了“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的意见。社会科学是有鲜明的阶级性的，资产阶级社会科学是为资产阶级的利益服务的。他们要“恢复”资产阶级社会科学，实际上就是要否定马克思主义，是想用资产阶级的领导代替工人阶级领导。我们是辩证唯物论者，我们要走社会主义道路，难道我们反应当首先去发展唯心论吗？难道听任资产阶级唯心主义思想泛滥，是我们走社会主义道路的人所能够接受的吗？
    我们并不是不要社会学、政治学和法律学，但是我们要的是马克思主义的社会学、经济学、法律学，我们要的是不违背社会发展规律的、不阻碍历史前进的、为劳动人民利益、为工人阶级利益服务的社会学、经济学、法律学。胡绳同志说得好：“我们对待资产阶级社会科学的态度不是简单的取消，但一定要在原则上加以否定。”我们的“百家争鸣”是在社会主义社会的基础上提出来的，是由于承认社会主义社会仍然存在着各种矛盾才提出来的，离开了党的领导和社会主义道路，根本就谈不到“百家争鸣”。事实上，如果资产阶级右派争取到统治地位，那根本就不可能有马克思主义的自由了，还谈什么自由争论呢？
    应当说我们之中，包括我个人在内，还有一些人是不熟悉或还不善于运用马克思主义来作研究工作并处理、观察事物的。但我们却一直都是在马克思主义思想指导之下，与各种非马克思主义思想作斗争的。我们这次更要坚决与右派分子划清思想界限，同时在斗争中也逐渐清除自己思想中的非无产阶级思想，加强思想改造，提高马克思主义水平，更进一步发展马克思主义的社会科学。我们的科学事业是坚决不能离开社会主义道路的。
