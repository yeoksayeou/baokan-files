    A Serious Problem Demanding Urgent Solution
    --An Abstract of the Beijing Post Office’s Report to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Requesting Prompt Correction of Newspaper Publication Delays

    Since December of last year, thanks to the constant urging from the central authorities, public criticism, and the active efforts of various newspaper offices to improve their work, there had been significant improvements in the publication times of newspapers in this city. The post office also provided strong support in the distribution, transportation, and delivery stages. Before March of this year, readers in this city could generally see newspapers between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM daily, and newspapers sent to other cities could largely catch the various trains departing from Beijing. This won unanimous praise from the majority of readers, who said that the newspaper offices and the post office had changed their work style and improved their work. In the first quarter of this year, neither the newspaper offices nor the post office heard or received much feedback from readers complaining about late newspapers.

    However, since April, newspaper publication times have become increasingly late. Although the situation is roughly the same for all newspapers, the People's Daily and Beijing Daily have the most frequent delays. In April, the People's Daily delivered newspapers on time only eight times, with twenty-two delays; in May, up to the 23rd, newspapers were delivered on time only four times, with nineteen delays. In addition to delays within the city, for twenty-three days in April, the 101 train to Tianjin was missed, and for eighteen days, all or part of the newspapers missed the 7th train to Wuhan. The Beijing Daily only delivered newspapers on time seven times in April, with twenty-three delays. In May, for twenty-three days, the newspapers were not delivered on time at all. Whether it is the People's Daily or the Beijing Daily, newspapers are often published and delivered as late as 7:00 AM or later, with delays of one, two, or even three hours. Even newspapers like Ta Kung Pao and Guangming Daily, which have always maintained early publication, were not as good in April and May as they were before. This shows that the untimely publication of newspapers has become a serious problem demanding urgent solution.

    Since the delays in newspaper publication times began, our bureau has been constantly in contact with various newspaper offices, asking them to quickly improve and restore normal publication times. On May 15th, we also invited various newspaper offices to a meeting to discuss improvement measures, but no improvement has been seen so far. During this period, in order to get the newspapers to readers as early as possible, our bureau has taken all necessary measures within its power. Just in terms of additional transport vehicles dispatched, from April 1st to May 18th, there were as many as 112 vehicle trips. Despite this, because the newspapers are published too late, readers still cannot see the newspapers as promptly as they did before March. Recently, complaints from readers have increased again. In this extremely abnormal situation, our bureau's distribution, transportation, and delivery operations are also very difficult. We can only deliver whichever newspaper is published on time today in the first batch in the morning, along with some letters (generally delivered in the city between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM, slightly later outside the city); whichever newspaper is not published on time and is delayed can only be delivered in the second batch along with the remaining letters. As a result, after the delivery personnel return from the first batch around 8:00 AM, they immediately go out for the second batch. This not only wastes a great deal of manpower and resources for the post office and makes the work very difficult, but also readers cannot see the newspapers earlier. Therefore, we demand that newspapers must quickly restore normal publication times.

    一个急待解决的严重问题
    ——北京市邮局请求迅速纠正报纸出版时间
    延误情况向邮电部的报告摘要
    自去年12月份以来，由于中央的不断督促，社会上舆论的指责，加之各报社积极改进工作，本市各报出版时间曾有了很大的改进。邮局在分发、运输、投递各环节也作了有力的配合。本年3月以前本市读者基本上能在每日晨六点半至八点左右看到报纸，发往外埠的报纸也大都可以赶上由北京开出的各次列车，因而博得广大读者的一致好评，说报社、邮局改变了工作作风，改进了工作。在今年第一季内，不论报社和邮局，都很少听到或收到读者反映报晚的意见。
    但是从4月份以后，报纸出版时间越来越晚。各报情况虽大致相同，但以人民日报和北京日报迟误次数最多。4月份人民日报只按规定时间交来八次报纸，延误二十二次；5月份截至23日，只按时交来四次，延误十九次。除了本市内的报纸延误外，4月份有二十三天没有赶上发去天津的一○一次火车，十八天全部或部分未赶上发京汉七次火车。北京日报4月份只有七次按规定时间交来报纸，延误二十三次，5月份二十三天来全部未按时交报。不论人民日报或北京日报，常常有迟到七点或七点以后才出版交报的情况，一误就是一两个或两三个钟头。一向保持早出版的大公报、光明日报等报4、5月份也不如以前了。由此可见报纸不按时出版已成为当前刻不容缓急待解决的严重问题。
    自报纸出版时间发生延误后，我局曾不断与各报社联系，要求他们迅速改进，恢复正常出版时间。5月15日并邀各报社开会研讨改进办法，但迄未见好转。在此期间，为了使报纸尽可能地早送到读者手里，我局曾在力所能及的情况下，采取了各种必要措施。仅以加派运输车辆统计，自4月1日至5月18日即已达一百一十二辆次。尽管如此，但因报纸出版得太晚，仍不能使读者像在3月以前那样准时看到报纸。最近以来读者不满的意见又多起来了。在这种极不正常的情况下，我局的分发、运输、投递等一连串的工作也十分困难。只好哪种报纸今天按时出版，哪种报纸今天就在早晨第一班投送，并带投一部份信件（城内一般在六点半至八点左右可送到，城外略迟）；哪种报纸未按时出版迟误了，哪种报就只好连同另一部份信件在第二班再投送。因而投递员在第一班八点左右投完回来以后，又紧接着出第二班，这样做，不仅邮局浪费人力物力很大，工作很困难，而读者还不能提早看到报纸。因此我们要求报纸必须赶快恢复正常出版时间。
