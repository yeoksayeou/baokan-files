Art Workers Must Stand Firm on the Working Class Standpoint
Liu Kaiqu, Wu Zuoren's Joint Speech

We wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and we fully agree with all other reports. We recommend that the Congress approve them in their entirety.

Our country, in the eight years since liberation, has undergone the great victories of the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Reforms, entering an unprecedented and grand socialist economic construction phase. The beautiful life of the 600 million Chinese people is being realized day by day. Only the Chinese Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, worries about the people's worries, enjoys the people's joys, and is dedicated to its loyalty and hard work, can lead such a backward old China to the road of a strong, prosperous, happy, and free socialist society and undertake such a great historical task.

When the people of the whole country were rejoicing over the country's rapid changes and the rapid progress of construction, the right-wing elements of the Zhang-Luo alliance and others, with the conspiracy of "replacing it," came to "help" the Party's rectification campaign, vainly trying to seize the world of the working people of the whole country and usurp the leadership of the Communist Party. This is truly "throwing eggs against stones." The shameless Zhang, Luo, and a small group of profit-seeking intellectuals rebelled together, trying to put on the cloak of intellectuals, deceive society, and lure other intellectuals into a wrong path. However, intellectuals who have studied Marxism-Leninism for many years are mostly patriotic, willing to take the socialist road, willing to follow the Communist Party, and will not be deceived by right-wing elements such as Zhang and Luo. The insane and greedy Zhang, Luo, and other black gang criminals have all embarked on a dead end and are inevitably abandoned by the people. However, the people are magnanimous, as Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Government Work Report": The people do not close the door to those who repent. Right-wing elements, where will you go, you choose yourselves.

Chairman Mao, in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," taught us to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and told us six criteria, especially the two most important: the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party. We are art workers, we must be able to be engineers of the human soul, which requires us to be based on the six truths, stand firm on the proletariat's position, distinguish right from wrong, strengthen vigilance, and resolutely fight to the end against all anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-people reactionary remarks and reactionary actions, and completely defeat the right-wing elements' rampant attacks.

The Comparison of the Past and Present of the Fine Arts Undertaking Shows that the Rightists are Alarmist

Workers, peasants, and all sectors of the country have used the unprecedented great achievements in various construction projects since liberation to prove that the right-wing elements' saying "a total darkness" is completely a thorough slander and slander. As far as we know, the development and achievements in the fine arts undertaking in the past few years are also enough to completely smash the right-wing elements' nonsense. The art schools that train the next generation of artists are three times more than before liberation, and the number of students has increased many times more than before; in order to improve arts and crafts and promote the excellent traditions of Chinese painting, the Ministry of Culture has successively established the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts and the Chinese Painting Academy; in developing the popularization of fine arts, most provinces and cities have established art studios, opened mass art schools, museums, or cultural centers; Beijing and local art publishing houses have issued hundreds of millions of New Year pictures, and other various art picture albums; cultural departments and art groups have organized or helped national and group or individual exhibitions of works, which are often held in Beijing and various provinces and cities, and the ideological and artistic level of the works has been significantly improved; The status of artists in politics and society has never been as high and valued as it is today in Chinese history. The Party and the government have helped artists to deeply engage in various aspects of life, travel to famous mountains and rivers. The ancient art creation mentioned that "reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles" has been achieved for artists in New China; in terms of life, various kinds of care have also been carried out, and this kind of care is gradually improving; in terms of creation conditions, the same is gradually being resolved. For example, the relevant art proposals we made at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress are being gradually implemented whenever possible at present. For example, in terms of art supplies, those that could be made independently in the past but stopped production are now gradually being restored. Some of the things that originally depended on imports have now been successfully trial-produced, and for those supplies that cannot be made independently, the government also approved foreign exchange last year to allow imports. According to our understanding, the Party and the government, according to the country's economic development, are also preparing to do a lot of work in the art undertaking, and this work has never existed in old China. In the short few years after liberation, the development and achievements in the fine arts undertaking have far exceeded any era in old China. Before liberation, art school graduates in the reactionary ruling era were unemployed and changed careers as soon as they left school, artists were discriminated against by society, and their lives were precarious. The tragic situation of the entire art world is worlds apart from today. From the comparison of the past and present of the art undertaking, we can also see the alarmist talk of the right-wing elements. They confuse right and wrong, set fires everywhere, take advantage of the fire to rob, and want to push our country back to the capitalist road. This kind of malicious conspiracy is really infuriating. Only by taking the socialist road and moving towards communism can China have the prosperity, happiness, and freedom of the Chinese people, and Chinese culture and art can achieve unprecedented development and prosperity.

Seriously Study Chairman Mao's Report, the Ideological and Artistic Nature of Art Work Can Be Improved

We must correctly understand the "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" proposed by the Party, and only then can we contribute to the great cause of promoting the prosperity of socialist culture. Our art workers should deeply study Chairman Mao's brilliant classic works, so that the ideological and artistic nature of our art creation can be improved and can truly serve the people.

Art is a powerful weapon of visualized propaganda and education. It is a silent language full of thought. It is a never-ending film and drama, not limited by time. Artworks can constantly give every viewer a profound feeling from thousands of years ago to thousands of years later, from this nation to another nation. Large ones, such as statues in parks and squares, sculptures and murals on public buildings, and single-panel hanging paintings, and small ones, such as practical art in daily life, can all give people education and encouragement at any time, and even have the effect of cultivating temperament.

The old society did not value art, especially in the places where the broad masses were located, there were no art products established. However, in the future, with the development of socialist economic construction and the gradual improvement of cultural life, the people will inevitably need more and more art products. In order to publicize socialist and communist ideas and spirit, we must also use art as a powerful weapon. Like the current individual places that regard art as a waste, this should be considered.

The development and improvement of art, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, mainly lies in the strong efforts of the art workers themselves: stand firm on the proletarian position, settle down among the working people, and become one with the working people. Only by deeply engaging in life in this way can we be familiar with the working people, deeply reflect their thoughts and feelings, and serve them. Remember Chairman Mao's words: "Without a correct political point of view, it is tantamount to having no soul." This means that in addition to being proficient in business, we must also strive to study Marxism-Leninism and study current affairs and politics in order to become a red expert. In this fierce struggle against the right-wing, we must train ourselves, test ourselves, examine our own thoughts, and thoroughly and resolutely transform ourselves. Our national art workers, together with the national working people, will always unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will fight strongly and unremittingly for socialist construction and for moving towards communism!

### 美术工作者要站稳工人阶级立场  刘开渠、吴作人的联合发言

    美术工作者要站稳工人阶级立场
    刘开渠、吴作人的联合发言
    我们衷心赞成周总理的政府工作报告，也完全同意其他各种报告。我们建议大会予以全部通过。
    我们的国家，解放八年以来，经过了五大运动和三大改革的伟大胜利，进入史无前例的规模宏大的社会主义经济建设，六亿中国人民的美好生活逐日在实现。能把这样落后的旧中国引上富强、幸福、自由的社会主义道路，能这样竭尽忠诚，艰苦奋斗，担负起如此伟大历史任务的，只有全心全意为人民服务的，先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐的中国共产党。
    当全国人民为祖国的日新月异，突飞猛进的建设，而欢欣鼓舞的时候，狼子野心的章、罗联盟等右派分子，以“取而代之”的阴谋，来“帮助”党内整风，妄想夺取全国劳动人民的天下，妄想篡夺共产党的领导权。这真是“以卵投石”。无耻的章、罗和一小撮利欲熏心的知识分子一起造反，他们想披着知识分子的外衣，蒙蔽社会并引诱其他知识分子走入歧途。殊不知，经过多年学习马克思列宁主义的知识分子，绝大多数是爱国的，是愿意走社会主义道路的，是愿意跟共产党走的，是不会受章、罗等右派分子欺骗的。丧心病狂，利令智昏的章、罗等黑帮罪人都是走上了绝路，是不可避免地全被人民所抛弃。但是，人民是宽大的，正如周总理在“政府工作报告”中所指出：人民对憣然悔悟的人，是不关门的。右派分子们何去何从，你们自己选择罢。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话里，教导我们辨别香花和毒草，告诉我们六条标准，尤其是社会主义的道路和共产党的领导两条更重要。我们是美术工作者，是要能做人类的灵魂工程师的，这就更要根据六条真理，站稳无产阶级立场，明辨是非，加强警惕，坚决与一切反共、反社会主义、反人民的反动言论及反动行动斗争到底，彻底打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    美术事业今昔之比，可以看出右派是危言耸听
    工人农民和全国各界，已用解放后各种建设上所获得的空前伟大成绩，证明右派分子说的“一团漆黑”，完全是彻头彻尾的谰言诬蔑。就我们所知道的，这几年在美术事业上的发展和成绩，也足够彻底粉碎右派分子的胡说八道。培养后一代美术家的美术院校，比解放前多了三倍，学生比以前增多了好些倍；为了提高工艺美术和发扬中国画的优良传统，文化部先后创办了中央工艺美术学院及中国画院；在开展普及美术方面，多数省市设立了美术工作室，开办了群众艺术学校、博物馆或文化馆；北京和各地美术出版社发行了数以亿万的年画，和其他各种美术图片画册；文化部门和美术团体组织或帮助的全国性的及团体或个人作品的展览会，在北京和各省市更是经常的举行，作品的思想和艺术水平都有显著的提高；美术家在政治、社会上的地位，在中国历史上是从来没有像今天这样高，这样受到重视的。党和政府帮助美术家深入各种生活，游历名山大川，古代美术创作上所说的“读万卷书，行万里路”，到新中国才为美术家做到了；在生活方面，也进行了种种的照顾，而这种照顾还在逐渐改进；在创作条件上，同样也进行了逐步的解决，例如我们去年在一届人代大会三次会议上的有关美术提案，凡在目前有可能做到的，都在逐步付诸实施，像美术用品方面，在过去能自制而停止生产了的，现在正在逐渐恢复，原靠进口的东西，现在有的自己已试制成功，不能自制的用品，政府去年也批准外汇，允许进口。据我们了解，党和政府根据国家的经济发展，在美术事业上，还准备做许多工作，而这些工作是在旧中国中从来没有过的。在解放后短短的几年中，美术事业上的发展和成就，已远远超过了旧中国的任何时代。解放前反动统治时代的美术学校毕业生，一出校就失业改行，美术家被社会歧视，生活朝不保夕，整个美术界的悲惨境遇和今天相比，真是有天渊之别。从美术事业的今昔之比，也看出右派分子的危言耸听。他们混淆是非，到处点火，乘火打劫，想把我们的国家倒退向资本主义道路。这种恶毒的阴谋，真是令人发指。中国只有走社会主义的道路，走向共产主义，才有中国人民的富强、幸福、自由，中国文化艺术才能得到空前的发展与茂盛。
    认真学习毛主席报告，美术工作的思想性、艺术性才能提高
    必须正确地认识党所提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，我们才有可能在推动社会主义文化繁荣的伟大事业中作出贡献。我们美术工作者应该深入地学习毛主席的光辉的经典著作，使我们的美术创作的思想性、艺术性能有提高，能真正为人民服务。
    美术是一种形象化的宣传教育的有力武器，它是富有思想而无声的语言，它是不闭幕的电影和戏剧，不受时间的限制。美术品从千百年前到千百年后，从这个民族到另一个民族，都能不断地给每个观者以深刻的感受。大的如公园广场中的雕像，公共建筑物上的雕刻、壁画、独幅挂画，小的如日常生活中的实用美术，对人都能随时给以教育、鼓舞，以至有陶冶性情的作用。
    旧社会不重视美术，尤其是广大群众所在的地方，更没有美术品的建立。但今后，随着社会主义经济建设的发展，文化生活逐渐提高，人民必然更多地需要各种美术品。为了宣传社会主义和共产主义思想精神，我们也必须利用美术这一有力的武器。像目前有个别地方把美术当做一种浪费，这是应加考虑的。
    美术的发展、提高，在党和政府的领导和扶植下，更主要的还在于美术工作者自身的坚强努力：站稳无产阶级立场，去劳动人民中间落户，和劳动人民打成一片。只有这样深入生活，才可能熟悉劳动人民，才能深刻地反映他们的思想感情，才能为他们服务。记住毛主席的话：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”，这就是说精通业务之外，还必须同时努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习时事政治，才能成为一个红色专家。在这场反右派的激烈斗争中，我们要锻炼自己，考验自己，要检查自己的思想，彻底地、坚决地改造自己，我们全国美术工作者和全国劳动人民一起，永远紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在共产党的领导下，坚强不懈地为社会主义建设，为走向共产主义而奋斗！
