The National Economic Commission recently held a briefing session to examine the expanded use of crepe rubber in the rubber industry.

Following Mr. Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, proposing a suggestion at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference in February regarding the expanded use of crepe rubber in the rubber industry, the State Council instructed the National Economic Commission to study the matter in conjunction with relevant departments. The Shanghai Municipal Chemical Industry Bureau completed the first trial in March, and has now determined the varieties and quantities of crepe rubber to be used in production in 1957. The Tianjin Rubber Industry Research Institute conducted systematic experimental research on the basic properties of crepe rubber in April and May, and made several tires entirely from crepe rubber for rapid mileage testing on automobiles. The factory director conferences held by the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry in March and April formulated a plan for the use of crepe rubber in 1957 and corresponding technical measures. Currently, all state-owned rubber factories have determined the catalog of products and components that will use crepe rubber, as well as the proportion of crepe rubber to be mixed into various products and components. The Ministry of Foreign Trade has already ordered a batch of crepe rubber from abroad, which is currently arriving in batches.

Gu Mu, Vice Chairman of the National Economic Commission, spoke at the meeting. He said that the further expansion of the use of crepe rubber is of great significance for reducing the cost of rubber products and saving national foreign exchange. After the crepe rubber arrives at the factories, relevant departments should actively expand its use based on the experimental results, and at the same time continue to closely monitor the unfinished experimental work. Vice Chairman Gu Mu also pointed out that because production units have little experience in this area, it is necessary to adopt a policy of active and prudent, gradual promotion.

Mr. Chen Jiageng was invited to attend the meeting. At the meeting, he introduced the production situation of crepe rubber abroad and his own decades of experience in the rubber industry. He also put forward two specific suggestions at the meeting. He believes that relevant departments can consider using the method of launching inter-factory competitions to further promote the expanded use of crepe rubber in various factories. In terms of foreign orders for crepe rubber, it is necessary to change the method of placing orders centrally once a year and adopt the method of placing orders in batches and at any time according to the order list, in order to adapt to the actual situation of crepe rubber production and supply abroad. His suggestions were taken seriously by the relevant departments and will be studied separately.

### 国家经济委员会召开会议  检查在橡胶工业扩大使用绉胶的情况

    国家经济委员会召开会议
    检查在橡胶工业扩大使用绉胶的情况
    本报讯　国家经济委员会日前召开汇报会议，检查了在橡胶工业中扩大使用绉胶的情况。
    政协全国委员会副主席陈嘉庚今年2月间在最高国务会议扩大会议上提出关于在橡胶工业中扩大使用绉胶的建议以后，国务院即责成国家经济委员会会同各有关部门进行研究。上海市化工局在3月间完成第一次试验，现在已经确定了1957年在生产上使用绉胶的品种和数量计划。天津橡胶工业研究所在4、5月间对绉胶的基本性能作了系统的试验研究，并且全部用绉胶做出数条轮胎，装在汽车上做快速里程试验。3、4月间举行的化工部、轻工业部厂长会议，制定出了1957年使用绉胶的计划和相应的技术措施。现在，各国营橡胶厂都已经确定了使用绉胶的产品和部件的目录，以及各种产品和部件中掺用绉胶的比例。对外贸易部已经从国外订购到一批绉胶，目前正陆续到货。
    国家经济委员会谷牧副主任在会上讲了话。他说，绉胶的进一步扩大使用，对于降低橡胶产品的成本和节约国家外汇具有重要的意义。各有关部门在绉胶到厂以后，应该根据试验结果积极扩大使用，同时应对尚未完成的试验工作继续抓紧进行。谷牧副主任还提出，由于生产单位在这方面的经验不多，因此必须采取积极稳妥、逐步推广的方针。
    陈嘉庚先生应邀出席了这次会议。他在会上介绍了国外绉胶的生产情况和他自己几十年来从事橡胶工业的经验。他还在会上提出了两个具体的建议。他认为有关部门可以考虑用发动厂际竞赛的方法，进一步推动各厂扩大使用绉胶；在绉胶国外订货方面，需要改变每年集中一次订货的方式，采取分批的、根据货单随时订货的办法，以适应国外绉胶生产和供应的实际情况。他的建议受到各有关部门的重视，将分别加以研究。
