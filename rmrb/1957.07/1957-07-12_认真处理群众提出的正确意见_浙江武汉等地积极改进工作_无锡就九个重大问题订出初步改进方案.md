Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th - Leading organs of Zhejiang Province are accepting well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions from non-Party members and are actively taking measures to improve their work.

The Chinese Communist Party group of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, based on the criticisms of non-Party members Xu Danren and Yu Caiqing, reviewed past shortcomings in leading silkworm breeding and proposed specific measures to improve work. Xu Danren criticized Zhejiang Province's relevant leading departments in early May at the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference for "emphasizing silkworms but not mulberry trees" over the years, putting the cart before the horse. He pointed out that this was the root cause of the slow recovery of silkworm production in Zhejiang Province in recent years. The Party group of the Department of Agriculture believes that this criticism is correct. The newly established Silkworm Breeding Administration has decided to send responsible cadres to silkworm areas such as Wuxing County to conduct investigations and formulate plans to increase mulberry garden production. The Department of Agriculture has also specially allocated a large number of medicines and machinery to areas severely affected by mulberry aphids to protect existing mulberry gardens and increase the yield of mulberry leaves this autumn. Non-Party member Yu Caiqing, director of the Provincial Mulberry Seedling Breeding Institute, criticized provincial leaders for not paying attention to collecting and researching the original soil species raised by the masses, resulting in the extinction of many characteristic soil species. The Provincial Department of Agriculture accepted this criticism and recently collected twenty-five new varieties for research.

The work style of leaders in many departments and bureaus has also improved significantly. Several Party member directors of the Provincial Urban Construction Bureau now always consult with the chief engineer and relevant technical personnel when encountering technical problems. The Department of Industry has established a system for each director to contact factories and go deep into the grassroots. In the past month, Zhang Guang, the second secretary of the Party group and deputy director, has visited Jinhua twice to help with work. At the initiative of Zhai Xiwu, the Party group secretary, several non-Party deputy directors have also gone deep into the grassroots to inspect and help with the production work of enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th - The Party and government leading organs of Wuhan City are seriously handling the opinions raised by the masses in the previous stage of the rectification movement and are actively improving the shortcomings in their work.

The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee have stipulated that every Thursday and Friday are meeting-free days, and cadres at all levels use these two days to go deep into the grassroots to help solve problems in their work, or to work and live with the masses. The Municipal Health Bureau and the Handicraft Industry Administration have not paid much attention to the handling and reception of people's letters and visits in the past. Now, in addition to assigning cadres to handle various opinions from the people, the Health Bureau has also designated a director to contact organs and grassroots cadres from 7 to 9 pm every night.

Some unreasonable living benefits of responsible cadres have also begun to be corrected. Directors of units such as the Textile Industry Administration and the Handicraft Industry Administration have voluntarily given up surplus houses to lower-level cadres. A few cadres who received extra welfare benefits have also voluntarily returned them. Many enterprises and institutions, such as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau and the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China, have abolished the "special medical treatment system" originally formulated for cadres at the section level and above. Now these cadres receive medical treatment according to the outpatient procedures, just like ordinary cadres. The masses believe that the two cadre children's schools run by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have isolated cadre children from the broad masses for a long time. Now the Municipal Committee, taking this shortcoming into consideration, has decided to close these two schools.

Many units have also made explanations or interpretations for opinions and requirements that cannot be fulfilled for the time being or are too high due to insufficient understanding of the actual situation. The Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee are also conducting problem sorting, comprehensive analysis and research on some issues that are widely involved but should be resolved, so as to deal with them separately.

This newspaper reported that, according to Nanjing Xinhua Daily: The opinions for improving work put forward by the vast majority of people at the Second Session of the Second Municipal People's Congress and the plenary session of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference in Wuxi in June are being seriously dealt with by the relevant departments.

As soon as the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference ended, the Wuxi Municipal People's Committee sorted out the opinions raised at the meeting according to their nature. Then, it convened a meeting of responsible persons of various administrative and enterprise units in the city to specifically study and arrange how to handle the correct opinions of people from all walks of life in accordance with the spirit of checking and correcting at the same time.

After organizing special topic groups to cooperate with relevant departments for investigation and research, the Municipal People's Committee has formulated preliminary improvement plans for nine major issues, such as industrial and commercial management, public-private partnership, graduate placement, and housing adjustment, and some of them have been implemented. For example, regarding the housing adjustment issue, a housing adjustment committee for organs has been established. Moreover, cadres from units such as the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal People's Committee, the Military Service Bureau, and the Warehousing Company have vacated some houses for other organs and residents who lack housing by tightening up offices and dormitories. The Warehousing Company alone has provided more than 30 rooms for residents. Bao Houchang, the first secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Jiang Jian, the mayor, took the lead in giving up part of their housing. For another example, regarding the issue of graduate placement, a guidance working committee for middle and primary school graduates has also been established, and it has contacted relevant units such as some enterprises in the city and the Suzhou Prefecture to study the issue of graduates' career paths.

The various bureaus under the Municipal People's Committee generally also held bureau affairs meetings to study the handling methods for criticisms and suggestions, and immediately started to solve problems that could be solved immediately. For example, the Textile Industry Bureau used to delay the issuance of production plans, which affected the factories' ability to prepare specific plans in a timely manner. Recently, the bureau arranged the third-quarter plan in a timely manner, and carefully investigated and analyzed the new problems that may be encountered in production in the third quarter, and the plan is more in line with reality. Some responsible cadres of the Health Bureau did not go to the grassroots often in the past. Now, after accepting opinions, they often go to the grassroots units to understand the situation, and have decided to transfer a group of cadres to enrich the grassroots.

    认真处理群众提出的正确意见
    浙江武汉等地积极改进工作
    无锡就九个重大问题订出初步改进方案
    新华社杭州11日电　浙江省省级领导机关接受党外人士的善意批评和建议，正在积极采取措施改进工作。
    浙江省农业厅中共党组根据党外人士徐淡人和余采青的批评，检查了过去领导蚕桑方面的缺点，提出了改进工作的具体措施。徐淡人5月上旬在省政协会议上批评浙江省有关领导部门历年来“重蚕不重桑”，本末倒置，他指出这是浙江省几年来蚕桑生产恢复缓慢的病根。农业厅党组认为这个批评是正确的。新成立的蚕桑管理局已决定派负责干部到吴兴县等蚕区进行调查，制定提高桑园产量的方案。农业厅并专门调拨了大批药械到桑蟥为害严重地区，以保护现有桑园，提高今秋桑叶产量。党外人士、省桑苗培育所主任余采青批评省领导上不重视收集研究群众原来饲养土种的工作，以致使许多有特点的土种绝种。省农业厅接受了这个批评，最近已收集到二十五种新品种，准备进行研究。
    不少厅、局领导人员的作风也有了显著改进。省城市建设局的几位党员局长，现在遇到有关技术性的问题，总是请总工程师和有关技术人员共同商讨。工业厅订出了各厅长分工联系各工厂、深入下层的制度，一个多月来，党组第二书记、副厅长张光曾两次到金华帮助工作；几个非党员副厅长在党组书记翟翕武的倡议下，也深入基层，检查和帮助企业的生产工作。
    新华社武汉11日电　武汉市党和政府领导机关，对前一阶段整风运动中群众提出的意见，正在认真处理，积极改进工作中的缺点。
    中共武汉市委和市人民委员会已经规定每星期四、五为无会议日，各级机关的干部们利用这两天时间深入基层帮助解决工作中的问题；或者去同群众一起劳动、一起生活。市卫生局和手工业管理局过去一向不大重视人民来信和来访的处理、接待工作，现在这两个局除调配干部处理来自人民群众的各项意见外，卫生局还指定一位局长在每天晚上七点到九点同机关和基层干部进行接触。
    负责干部的某些不合理的生活待遇也已经开始着手纠正。纺织工业管理局、手工业管理局等单位的局长们主动把多余的屋子让给下级干部住；少数多领福利费的干部也自动地退了出来。武汉长江大桥工程局、中国人民银行武汉分行等不少企业和事业单位，将原来为科级以上干部制订的“特诊制度”已全部废除。现在这些干部和一般干部一样按门诊手续就医。群众认为中共武汉市委办的两所干部子弟学校使干部子弟长期同广大群众隔绝，现在市委考虑到这个缺点，已决定将这两所学校停办。
    很多单位还对一时不能办到或由于对实际情况不够了解而要求过高的意见和要求，作了交代或解释。有些牵涉面较广但又应该解决的问题，市委和市人民委员会也正在进行问题排队、综合分析研究，以便分别处理。
    本报讯　据南京新华日报报道：无锡市6月份召开的市二届人代大会第二次会议和市政协全体委员会议上，绝大多数人所提的改进工作的意见，正由有关部门作认真的处理。
    无锡市人民委员会在人代会、政协会一结束，就将会上所提的意见按性质排队整理。接着，召集全市各行政、企业单位负责人开会，专门研究和布置如何根据边查边改精神处理各界人士正确的意见。
    市人民委员会组织专题小组配合有关部门调查研究后，已就工商管理、公私共事、毕业生安排、房屋调整等九个重大问题订出初步的改进方案，有些并已着手实行。如房屋调整问题，已成立机关房屋调整委员会；并且已由中共市委、市人委、兵役局、仓储公司等单位干部用紧缩办公室和宿舍等方法让出一部分房屋给缺房子的其他机关和居民使用，单仓储公司一个单位让给居民用的房子就有三十多间。市委第一书记包厚昌和市长江坚等负责同志都带头让出了一部分住房。又如，毕业生安排问题，也已成立中、小学毕业生指导工作委员会，并和本市部分企业和苏州专署等有关单位联系，研究毕业生的出路问题。
    市人委所属各个局一般也召开了局务会议，研究了对批评和建议的处理办法，能马上解决的问题立即动手解决。如纺织工业局以前下达生产计划时往往拖拖拉拉，影响各厂不能及时编制具体计划；最近该局布置第三季度计划做到及时，并事先对第三季度生产上可能遇到的新问题作了仔细的调查分析，计划比较符合实际。卫生局一些负责干部以前不大下基层，现在接受意见经常往基层单位了解情况，并决定下放一批干部充实基层。
