    Little Li Ping
    Chen Jian
    In a bulldozer squadron at the Sanmenxia construction site, there was a female student worker who was called Little Li Ping because of her short stature.

    Little Li Ping was seventeen years old this year and was born in Tangshan City, Hebei Province. When she was fourteen years old, after graduating from elementary school, she dreamed of becoming a worker. Being a worker wasn't that simple; aside from other things, based on her small age and small stature alone, no factory would accept her. Some people said, "What could she do? Be a childcare worker? She would definitely cry along with the children." She told the head of the local police station about her wish and begged him to falsely add two years to her age in the household registration book. The station chief said, "That can't be done." She felt wronged and annoyed. Other girls looked forward to the New Year to wear fancy clothes and dress up beautifully. Little Li Ping said, "I look forward to the New Year so I can be a year older and get into a factory."

    In the morning, she stood on the street or at the factory gate, watching the workers going to work, and she was so envious that tears flowed. In the evening, she still stood there, welcoming those workers getting off work. The employees of Huaxin Textile Factory, Qixin Cement Factory, and Tangshan Iron and Steel Factory may never have noticed that this little girl often stood at the entrance of their factories, with a ruddy face, round eyes, and a gleam of supplication and longing.

    In July of last year, her wish came true. The Ministry of Water Resources recruited a group of female student workers in Tangshan, and she was accepted and happily accepted the assignment from the leadership—to learn to operate a bulldozer. In learning, Little Li Ping did not lack perseverance; only one thing troubled her: she was small, short, and lacked strength. Many people advised her, "Little Li Ping, give up! You'll disappear sitting in the bulldozer; how can you move the clutch?" Little Li Ping treated these words, which sounded like sarcasm and jokes, as if they were wind in her ears.

    When Little Li Ping arrived in Guanting, she was only a little over sixteen years old. Really, how she wished she could grow taller, even if it was just half an inch. To grow taller quickly, Little Li Ping decided to pay attention to her lifestyle and nutrition, and exercise more. From then on, Little Li Ping was often seen running around on the court. Those who didn't know the details thought she had become a football fan.

    The news of going to Sanmenxia made Little Li Ping very excited. She had heard a lot about the Sanmenxia project. But what she remembered most was a surprising number: seven thousand machines were serving it. Seven thousand! Could this be a joke? This time she was really going to open her eyes! When she arrived at Sanmenxia, she wasn't considered a student; she was an apprentice. An apprentice has to help the master do a lot of odd jobs. The master said, "Little Li Ping, fetch a bucket of water." She hurriedly walked down the steep hillside, filled the bucket, but couldn't lift it up. The master said, "Let two people carry it." That didn't work either; Little Li Ping was short, and the bucket always slid towards her side, splashing water all over her body and head. Little Li Ping insisted on exercising herself, starting with half a bucket, gradually filling the bucket. After filling several buckets in a row, her arms ached for a few days, but she finally trained herself. Wiping the machine was also not that simple. She was small and her arms were short. She had to get her whole body on it, and her work clothes became a wiping cloth. After the machine was wiped clean, she looked like she had rolled in putty. Others laughed at her, but Little Li Ping said, "It doesn't matter; my task is to wipe the machine clean."

    During the Spring Festival, all bulldozer apprentices had to take their first field test. The test content was starting the machine. If starting was passed, they would proceed to practical operation. It just so happened that Little Li Ping was sick at this time. How could she let go of this opportunity? She got out of bed and participated. Her face was pale, and her heart was pounding, but on the surface, she walked to the bulldozer calmly. She vigorously moved the crank, but it didn't start after two tries. The people below said in unison, "No good, it didn't move." She panicked for a moment, brushed the short hair covering her eyes behind her ears, and with all her strength, turned it sharply. The machine immediately made a Peng! Peng! Peng... sound. The crowd surged forward, reached out, helped her down from the vehicle, and all gave her a thumbs up, saying, "Little Li Ping! Good, the first shot was a hit."

    Recently, Little Li Ping accepted a glorious task: to use her bulldozer to pull an electric shovel with a capacity of three cubic meters from the railway station to the construction site for installation. She and her master sat side by side on the bulldozer seat, their eyes staring straight ahead. When they encountered steep slopes and narrow canyon paths, the master wanted to help her, but she stopped him: "I'll do it myself!" She drove boldly and steadily.

    小李萍

    三门峡工地一个推土机中队里，有个女学工，因为个子矮，大伙都喊她小李萍。
    小李萍今年十七岁，生在河北省唐山市。十四岁那年，她小学毕业，就梦想做一名工人。当工人可不那么简单，别的先不谈，就凭她那小小的年纪和小小的个儿，哪个工厂也不收。有人说：“要她做什么？当保育员吗？那一定会和孩子一块哭得不可开交。”她把心愿告诉了派出所的所长，央求他在户籍簿上把她的年龄虚加两岁。所长说：“那怎么能行。”她感到委屈和气恼。别的女孩子盼望新年，是为了穿花衣裳，打扮得漂漂亮亮。小李萍说：“我盼新年，是为了多长一岁好进工厂。”
    早晨，她站在大街上或工厂门口，望着上班的工人，竟羡慕得流出眼泪。傍晚，她还是这样的站着，迎接那些下班的工人。华新纺织厂、启新水泥厂和唐山钢铁厂的职工们，也许从来没有注意，在他们的工厂门口，经常站着这个小女孩，红朴朴的脸，圆圆的大眼睛，闪烁着乞求和渴望的光芒。
    去年7月，她的愿望实现了。水利部在唐山招考一批女学工，她考取了，并且愉快地接受了领导上的分配——学推土机。在学习上，小李萍不缺乏坚韧的毅力，只有一条使她苦恼：人小，个子矮，没力气。很多人劝她：“小李萍，算了吧！你坐在推土机里就失踪了，咋能搬动离合器？”对这些听来又像讽刺又像玩笑的话，小李萍只当做耳旁风。
    小李萍到官厅时，才十六岁多一些。真的，她多希望自己再长高一些呵，那怕是半寸也好。为了快点长高，小李萍就下决心注意生活规律和饮食营养，多运动。从此在球场上，经常看见小李萍跑来跑去，不知底细的，还以为她成了球迷。
    来三门峡的消息，使小李萍非常兴奋。关于三门峡工程，她听得真不少了。但她记得最牢的是一个惊人的数字：有七千台机械为它服务。七千台！这能是开玩笑吗？这回她真要开开眼界啦！到了三门峡，她不算学生，算徒工了。一个徒工，要帮助师傅做好多零活，师傅说：“小李萍，提一桶水来。”她慌忙走下陡削的山脚下，桶灌满了，提不上来，师傅说，两个人提吧。提也不行，小李萍个子矮，水桶老是滑向她那边，溅了她一身一头水。小李萍坚持自己锻炼，开始打半桶，逐渐打满桶，连连打了几个满桶后，两个胳臂酸疼了几天，终于锻炼出来了。擦机器也不那么简单，人小，胳臂短，整个人都上去了，工作服成了擦油布，机器擦完了，她自己就像在油灰里打了个滚。别人笑她，小李萍说：“没关系，我的任务是把机器擦干净。”
    春节时，所有推土机的徒工都要进行第一次实地测验。测验内容是发动机器。发动及格了，就要进行操作实习了。正巧这时小李萍病了。她那能放过这个机会，从床上爬起，也参加了。她脸色苍白，心里忽咚忽咚的乱跳，但表面却很从容地走上了推土机。她用力搬动摇把，一连两次，没有发动起来，下边的人异口同声地说：“不中，没有动。”她慌乱一下，把盖在眼前的短发撩到耳后去，用尽所有的力气，猛地转动了一下，机器马上发出呯！呯！呯……的响声。人群涌上去，伸出手，把她从车上接下来，都伸出大拇指说：“小李萍！中，第一炮就打响了。”
    最近，小李萍接受了一个光荣的任务：从火车站上，把三立方公尺容量的电铲用她的推土机拉到工地进行安装。她和师傅并排坐在推土机的座位上，眼睛直视着前方，遇到陡坡和峡谷小道时，师傅想帮助她，她阻止了：“我自己来！”大胆稳健地开了过去。
