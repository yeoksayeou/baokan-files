    We Must Never Allow Rightists to Usurp Leadership in Science and Culture
    Luo Changpei
    President Guo Moruo's speech at the National People's Congress has refuted the rightists' fallacies about scientific work from all aspects. Subsequently, I listened to the speeches of Minister Lu Dingyi and Comrade Pan Zinian. In recent days, the self-criticisms of Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and others at the scientists' symposium, and the righteous accusations of many scientists against some rightists in the scientific community, have made me feel even more that the "Several Opinions on the Relevant Scientific System of Our Country" put forward by the rightists in the name of the Provisional Group for Scientific Planning of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League is, from beginning to end, an attempt to seize leadership in scientific work and a conspiracy to lead scientists away from the socialist path. Now, based on my personal experiences over the past few decades, I would like to offer a few opinions on the fallacies in the social science section of this anti-socialist program.
    This "Opinions" document first puts forward the slogan of so-called "protecting scientists," which is a very malicious attempt to create the impression that Chinese scientists are threatened or persecuted and need to be "protected." Based on my personal experience, comparing before and after liberation, I can use facts to eloquently refute this fallacy of fabricating black and white. During the Anti-Japanese War, I was in Kunming. At that time, I very much wanted to use Yunnan, the golden land of linguistics, to conduct investigations and research on ethnic minority languages, but I could not get help from the Academia Sinica of the Kuomintang, nor from the Ministry of Education of the Kuomintang and the Southwest Associated University. Some of the ethnic minority language materials I painstakingly obtained were barely picked up by taking advantage of lectures and helping local governments compile county chronicles. Once, I sat on the driver's seat of a commercial truck, returning to Kunming alone from Dali, because this commercial vehicle was carrying smuggled goods and was inspected by the anti-smuggling vehicle. When they checked, I stood at the front of the car and was knocked down by two cars, almost breaking my back in two. At that time, not only did no one care, but there was even no talk of protection. Now, the Institute of Ethnic Minority Languages has expanded from a group in the Institute of Linguistics to a full institute. And when I had a physical examination in 1953, I was found to have hypertensive cardiovascular disease. The leadership showed great concern and allowed me to take long-term rest. Over the years, I have been treated by all the famous doctors in Beijing and used all kinds of advanced medical methods. Looking back on the past and present, I only feel ashamed and hate myself for not being able to fully recover my health and work hard sooner. Comparing the two societies before and after, isn't it very obvious which one can earnestly protect scientists?
    As for the time issue for scientific workers, since 1956, many real scientists have been able to guarantee six-fifths of their time for professional work. As for those who still cannot guarantee it, we must analyze the specific circumstances of individuals: one category is people like me who cannot fully recover their health and can only devote half of their time to work. The other category is people like Fei Xiaotong who hold multiple positions (as far as I can count, there are Vice President of the Central Institute for Nationalities, Deputy Director of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, Deputy Director of the Expert Bureau of the State Council, Deputy Director of the Institute of Nationalities of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the heads of the Survey Team for the History of Social Development of Nationalities...) and also did a lot of anti-Party and anti-people activities in the Zhang-Luo alliance. If such people still complain that they don't have enough time and no time to do scientific research, then it can be said in a Beijing dialect, it's simply "serves them right"! It's their own fault!
    Scientists need research assistants or administrative assistants to avoid affecting work efficiency, which is quite right. However, my personal view on assistants is completely different from Qian Weichang's view that assistants "belong" to a certain professor or scientist. For twenty years, I have also cultivated some young scientific workers, some of whom are also my collaborators, but now I don't have any well-matched assistants around me. This is not because I can't find suitable talents, but because I let them play a greater role in socialist construction. For example, I can select several capable collaborators from the seven ethnic minority language survey teams and the hundreds of people in the dialect survey team. But is it more important to let them help me personally write articles and books, or is it more important to let them collectively work hard for the socialist cultural cause under the cultivation of veteran scientists, and at the same time, to train themselves and improve themselves in helping veteran scientists? This is precisely the key to the difference between capitalist scholarship and socialist scholarship. In the past, Lao Tzu said: "Heaven and earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs." Later, some people ridiculed those who specialized in exploiting the labor of assistants and writing books and articles themselves, saying: "Professors are ruthless, treating teaching assistants as straw dogs!" I hope that Qian Weichang and those who think like Qian Weichang that assistants "belong" to professors or researchers should be deeply vigilant.
    The importance of data for scientific research, especially social science research, is recognized by scientific workers. However, after this rampant attack on the Party by the rightists, I believe that the proposition that "data of scientists and professors need not be kept confidential" still requires us to strengthen vigilance from a class analysis perspective. In fact, those who claim not to create academic monopolies and private ownership of results are themselves monopolizing academics. When I was teaching at Tsinghua University, I found that the Tsinghua University Library had many rare or unique books on linguistics. After Tsinghua was reorganized into a comprehensive engineering university, I personally suggested to Qian Weichang that this part of the books should be well utilized to give full play to its effectiveness. Qian Weichang said that temporary borrowing was possible, and that we would still like to keep this batch of books, preparing for exhibitions when capitalist countries come to visit in the future. Later, the Institute of Linguistics once borrowed a copy of Grierson's "Linguistic Survey of India" from Tsinghua, but the Tsinghua Library sent someone to retrieve it in less than a month, and declared that if it was not returned, the interlibrary loan rights would be immediately suspended. It is said that Professor Feng Zhi of Peking University also received the same treatment when he borrowed Goethe's Complete Works from them. I ask Qian Weichang, you want to turn Tsinghua University into an American Caltech, what is the use of monopolizing this part of linguistics and literature books for an engineering university, and what loss does this cause to the people? I would like to ask the Second Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Higher Education, and President Jiang Nanxiang of Tsinghua University to handle this fairly and reasonably.
    Social science has a clear class nature. The so-called social science of the bourgeoisie is a reflection of the bourgeois political and economic system and serves the interests of the bourgeoisie. The "Opinions" document put forward by the rightists of the China Democratic League first advocates "changing the attitude towards bourgeois social science" and "restoring" bourgeois social science in the field of social science, and does not mention Marxism or the Chinese Communist Party anywhere in the entire text. This is obviously against the guiding ideology of our philosophy and social science, and is obviously anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. According to their argument, in the field of law, the laws under the reactionary rule are completely confused with the laws that oppress the people and our laws that serve the people; they even make the absurd statement that "bourgeois law has the standpoint of the people," etc. In the field of economics, Professor Xu Yunan of Peking University studied Keynesian economics before liberation. After liberation, he deeply studied many Marxist classical works. Recently, after he translated Keynesian economics, he criticized it, and was mercilessly scolded by the rightists, who believed that he should only introduce it and not criticize it. Isn't it obvious that they completely want to restore bourgeois social science? We now warn the rightists: The people's philosophy and social science workers can study and criticize all sciences under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, but bourgeois social science will absolutely not be allowed to be restored, because this is completely the difference between two lines and the positions of two classes!
    For more than 30 years, the Chinese Communist Party has always emphasized the importance of investigation and research, and has consistently adhered to the truth that there is no right to speak without investigation and research. Chairman Mao's "Report on the Investigation of the Hunan Peasant Movement" and "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside" are typical works of investigation and research. In every revolutionary period, no policy or decree of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government has not been able to move from practice to victory without investigation and research, from the masses to the masses. The rightists said: "We believe that social science researchers should be encouraged to pay attention to investigation and research, and provide opinions on government policies and decrees based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Government departments should actively provide relevant materials to relevant social science researchers as much as possible and help them create conditions for research work. Only in this way can social science research be linked to practice and can overcome the current state of theory lagging behind practical needs." According to their argument, it seems that all Marxists and all those who have been tempered by class struggle do not understand investigation and research, and only those "masters" of "sociology" who have received bourgeois training understand investigation and research and can conduct investigation and research. In fact, this is not the case. The achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in investigation and research over the past 30 years, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the rapid progress in all aspects since the founding of the country have already been proven by facts, and I don't need to say more. But what are the academic achievements and contributions to the people of the social investigation institutions organized by the bourgeoisie in the past with the "Sino-American Cultural Fund," "British Boxer Indemnity," and "American Rockefeller Foundation," other than sending a few intelligence reports to its funders in English? According to Fei Xiaotong's confession of "confessing guilt to the people": "During the inspection in Jiangsu, I conducted a short-term rural survey. I raised questions and suggestions from the bourgeois standpoint and method, which in essence played a role in opposing and doubting socialism. In the reports I wrote, there was not only no class analysis, but also the achievements of the Party in rural work were covered up by emphasizing shortcomings. In some suggestions, it had an even worse effect of provoking the relationship between the Party and the peasants. I also tried to use these materials to write publicity works for foreign countries. If I had done so, the harm that might have been caused would have been even greater." Fortunately, he did not finally "use these materials to write publicity works for foreign countries," otherwise wouldn't he have done another espionage work for capitalist countries, like the work he did in Kuixing Pavilion in Chenggong, Yunnan? As for some of the investigation and research that some other "masters" who have received bourgeois training have done, investigating prostitutes without analyzing the social essence that produces this system, investigating genealogies without analyzing the class composition of the characters recorded, it will become purely subjective due to pure objectivity. Do we still want to allow this kind of bourgeois sociology to be restored now?
    Among the five people who originally submitted this anti-socialist science program to the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, I have worked with Zeng Zhaolun for the longest time and known him for the longest time, but no political connection has ever occurred. It was not until recently that Mr. Wu Youxun revealed that before the State Council announced Guo Moruo as the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he had long harbored the ambition to usurp the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which made me recall an incident. In May 1951, after the State Council announced my appointment as the Director of the Institute of Linguistics, he once gathered the other three professors of Peking University and tried his best to persuade me not to go to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and presumptuously used the mind of a petty person to entice me with other positions. Using this incident to verify the fact that he pulled away five researchers from the Institute of Chemistry, it can be seen that he has been deliberately undermining the Chinese Academy of Sciences and intentionally provoking the contradiction between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the higher education system for more than a day. Another comrade who participated in the school affairs of Peking University at that time told me that Zeng Zhaolun hesitated for several days before deciding to accept the position when he was announced as the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education. What he was dissatisfied with was that there was still a "vice" in the official title. How could a political ambitious person with such a pursuit of fame and position not collude with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji?
    People like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, who are ambitious, greedy, and ignorant street politicians, are not worth mentioning among scholars. Zhang Bojun advised people not to read Marxism-Leninism but to read the family letters of Zeng Guofan. Luo Longji mistakenly believed that Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi were people of the Yuan Dynasty in the lecture hall, which can also imagine the knowledge of this kind of "great intellectuals." Unfortunately, although the five signatories who put forward this anti-socialist science program may have different degrees of mastermind and coercion from Fei Xiaotong, some are willing to collude with Zhang and Luo, and some may have been induced by some other means, which makes us feel deeply disgusted and also feel pity and no joy. From this lesson, we scientists must keenly realize: Assuming that we are serious about being a people's scientist and a socialist intellectual, we must change the bourgeois standpoint and establish the world outlook of the working class, so that we will not betray and degenerate and cut ourselves off from the people!

    我们决不容许右派分子篡夺科学和文教的领导权
    罗常培
    郭沫若院长在全国人民代表大会上的发言已经从各方面驳斥了右派分子关于科学工作的谬论。随后我听了陆定一部长和潘梓年同志的发言。近几天来曾昭抡、钱伟长等人在科学家座谈会上的检讨和许多科学家们对于科学界中一些右派分子义正词严的指斥，使我更觉得右派分子用民盟中央科学规划临时小组的名义所提出的“对于有关我国科学体制的几点意见”彻头彻尾是企图夺取科学工作的领导权，并且阴谋引导科学家离开社会主义道路。我现在从几十年来个人的切身感受，对这个反社会主义纲领中关于社会科学部分的谬论提出几点意见。
    这个“意见书”中首先提出了所谓“保护科学家”的口号，这是很恶毒地企图造成一种印象：我国科学家受到威胁，或者迫害，需要加以“保护”。就我个人经验，拿解放前后来对比，就可以用事实很雄辩地驳斥了这种捏造黑白的谬论。抗日战争期间我在昆明，当时我很想利用云南这块语言学的黄金地进行少数民族语言的调查研究，但是既得不到国民党中央研究院的帮助，也得不到国民党教育部和西南联合大学的帮助；我辛辛苦苦所获得的一些少数民族语言材料是靠着讲演和替地方修县志的方便勉强捡来的。有一次我坐在一个商运卡车的司机台上，只身从大理回昆明，因为这辆商车装运私货，被缉私车检查。当他们检查时，我站在车头，被两辆车撞倒，几至腰断两截。这个时候不但没有人过问，更谈不到保护了。现在少数民族语言研究所已经从语言研究所的一个组扩充成为一个所了。而我自己在1953年检查身体时发现了高血压性的心脏血管病，领导上多方关怀，让我长期休养。这些年来，经过了北京所有名医的诊治，用尽了各种先进的医疗方法。抚今思昔，只有愧恨自己不能早日完全恢复我健康，努力工作。拿前后两个社会来对比，哪一个能够认真地保护科学家不是很显然的吗？
    至于科学工作者的时间问题，自从1956年起已经有不少真正的科学家能够保证六分之五的从事业务工作的时间。至于其中一部分还保证不了，那得分析个人的具体情况：其中一类是像我这样身体不能完全恢复健康，只能以一半时间从事工作的人。另一类是像费孝通那样身兼数职
  （据我数得过来的有中央民族学院副院长、中央民族事务委员会副主任、国务院专家局副局长、中国科学院民族研究所副所长、民族社会发展史调查队负责人之一……）另外还在章罗联盟里边做了许多反党反人民的勾当的人。像这样的人还要抱怨时间不够，没有时间做科学研究，那可以用一句北京话来说，简直是“活该”！是他自作自受！
    科学家需要研究助手或行政助手，以免影响工作效率，这话是相当对的。但是我个人对助手的看法和钱伟长认为助手是属于某个教授或科学家的看法完全不同。二十年来。我也曾经培植过一些青年科学工作者，其中也有一些是我的合作者，但是到现在我的身边反倒没有相得益彰的助手。这并不是找不到合适的人材，而是我让他们在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用去了。譬如我在七个少数民族语言调查队里和几百人的方言普查队里很可以选拔出好几个得力的合作人来。但是究竟是让他们帮助我个人写文章写书重要，还是让他们一方面在老科学家培植下集体地为社会主义文化事业努力，一方面在帮助老科学家工作中锻炼自己、提高自己更重要，这正是资本主义学术跟社会主义学术观点的关键所在。从前老子说：“天地不仁，以万物为刍狗。”后来有人讥讽专门剥削助手劳动，自己写书写文章的人们说：“教授不仁，以助教为刍狗！”我希望钱伟长以及和钱伟长同样认为助手是“属于”教授或研究员的人应该深自警惕。
    资料对于科学研究，尤其是社会科学研究的重要，是科学工作者所承认的。但是经过这次右派分子向党猖狂进攻之后，我认为“对于科学家、教授所有资料不必保密”的提法，我们仍旧不能不从阶级分析上加强警惕。其实扬言不要造成学术垄断、成果私有的人本身就是垄断学术的人。我在清华大学教书的时候发现清华大学图书馆里有许多关于语言学的善本书或孤本书。当清华已经改组成综合性的工科大学以后，我曾亲自向钱伟长提出这部分书籍应当很好地利用，以发挥它的效能。钱伟长说，暂时借是可以的，我们还愿保留这批书，准备将来有资本主义国家参观时可以展览。后来语言研究所曾经向清华借过一部葛立尔逊的“印度语言调查”，没出一月清华图书馆就派人索回，并且声明如若不还，立即停止馆际借书权。听说北京大学冯至教授向他们借用过歌德全集，也受到同样的待遇。试问钱伟长，你想把清华大学办成一个美国加省理工大学，这一部分语言文学的图书被你垄断起来，对于理工大学究竟有什么用处，这样做对于人民究竟造成了什么损失？这一点还请国务院第二办公室和高等教育部以及清华大学的蒋南翔校长作公平合理的处理。
    社会科学有鲜明的阶级性。资产阶级的所谓社会科学是资产阶级的政治制度和经济制度的反映，是为资产阶级利益服务的。民盟右派分子所提出的“意见书”在社会科学方面首先倡议“改变对待资产阶级社会科学的态度”和“恢复”资产阶级社会科学，而且全文中没有一个地方提到马克思主义，没有一个地方提到中国共产党。这很显然是反对我们的哲学社会科学的主导思想，显然是反党反人民反社会主义的。照他们的说法，在法学一方面，根本混淆了反动统治下的法律是压迫人民的，我们的法律是为人民服务的；甚至于说“资产阶级法律里具有人民的立场”等等谰言。在经济学一方面，像北京大学的徐毓楠教授在解放前是研究凯因斯经济学的，解放以后深入钻研了许多马克思主义古典著作，最近他把凯因斯的经济学翻译以后加以批判，就受到右派分子的无情的责骂，认为他只该介绍不该批判。这不显然可见他们完全想把资产阶级的社会科学复辟吗？我们现在正告右派分子：人民的哲学社会科学工作者在马克思列宁主义指导之下对于各门科学都可以研究并批判的，但是对于资产阶级的社会科学绝对不容许它复辟，因为这完全是两条路线的不同，两种阶级的立场！
    三十多年来，中国共产党一向强调调查研究的重要，一贯坚持没有调查研究就没有发言权这一真理。毛主席的 “湖南农民运动考察报告”和“中国农村的社会主义高潮”都是调查研究的典型著作。在各个革命时期，中国共产党和人民政府的一切政策法令没有不是经过调查研究，从群众中来再到群众中去，才能从实践走向胜利。右派分子说：“我们认为应该鼓励社会科学研究工作者重视调查研究工作，根据实事求是的精神，对政府的政策法令提供意见。政府部门应主动地将有关资料尽量供给有关的社会科学研究工作者。并帮助他们创造研究工作的条件。只有这样，社会科学研究工作才能与实际相联系。才能克服目前理论落后于实际需要的状态。”照他们的说法，好像一切马克思主义者、一切经过阶级斗争锻炼的人都不懂调查研究，只有那些受过资产阶级训练的“社会学”“大师”们才懂得调查研究、才会调查研究似的。其实并不如此。过去三十几年来中国共产党关于调查研究方面的成就，中华人民共和国的建立以及建国以后在各方面突飞猛进的成绩已经有事实可以证明，用不着我来多说。但是资产阶级过去用“中美文化基金”、“中英庚子赔款”和“美国洛克菲勒基金”所组织的社会调查机构，除了用英文向它的资助者寄出几分情报以外，学术上的成就在哪里？对人民的贡献在哪里？据费孝通“向人民伏罪”的自白里说：“在江苏视察时期，我进行了短期的农村调查，我从资产阶级立场和方法提出问题和建议，实质上起了反对和怀疑社会主义的作用。在所写的报道中，不但没有阶级分析，而且以强调缺点来掩盖党在农村工作中的成就。在某些建议中更起了挑拨党和农民关系的恶劣影响。我还企图用这些资料，另行写成对外宣传作品，如果这样做了，可能引起的危害性必然更大。”幸而他最后还没有“用这些资料，另行写成对外宣传作品”，否则岂不是又向资本主义国家做了一次谍报工作，像在云南呈贡魁星阁里所做的工作一样吗？至于其他一些受过资产阶级训练的“大师”们所曾经做过的一些调查研究，调查妓女而不分析所以产生这种制度的社会本质，调查家谱而不分析所记人物的阶级成分，那更会由于纯客观变成纯主观了。像这种资产阶级的社会学难道我们现在还要让它复辟吗？
    在原来向国务院科学规划委员会提出这个反社会主义科学纲领的五个人中，我和曾昭抡同事最久，认识的时候也较长，但是丝毫没发生过政治的联系。直到最近吴有训先生揭发他在前政务院发表郭沫若做科学院院长以前，他早就蓄有篡夺科学院领导权的野心，才让我回忆起一件事来。1951年5月间政务院发表我做语言研究所所长后，他有一天约集了北大的其他三位教授极力劝我不要到科学院去，并且妄以小人之心度君子地拿其他的地位来引诱我。用这件事情来印证他拉走化学所五位研究员的事实，可见他存心破坏科学院，有意挑拨科学院和高教系统的矛盾已经非止一日了。还有一位当时参与北大校务的同志告诉我说，曾昭抡在发表做高等教育部副部长的时候，踌躇了好几天才决定去就，他所不满意的就是在官衔上还有一个“副”字。像怀有这样追求名位的政治野心家怎能不会和章伯钧、罗隆基同流合污呢？
    像章伯钧、罗隆基一类的野心家，本来是利欲熏心、胸无点墨的马路政客，不足齿于学者之林的。章伯钧劝人不读马列主义而读曾国藩家书，罗隆基在讲堂上把程灏、程颐误认为元朝人，也可以想见这类“大知识分子”的知识了。可惜提出这份反社会主义科学纲领的五位署名人虽然和费孝通也许有主谋和胁从的不同，有的甘心和章罗同流合污，有的可能是受了其他的某种诱骗，使我们一方面觉得深恶痛绝，一方面觉得哀矜勿喜。从这个教训，使我们科学家要痛切地觉悟：假定我们认真地要做一个人民的科学家、社会主义的知识分子，必须改变资产阶级的立场，建立工人阶级的世界观，然后才不至于变节蜕化，自绝于人民！
