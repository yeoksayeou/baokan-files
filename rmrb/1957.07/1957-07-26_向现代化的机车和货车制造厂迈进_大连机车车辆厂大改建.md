Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, July 25th (Xinhua reporter Gu Tiefeng): The old Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is accelerating its pace towards becoming a modernized locomotive and freight car manufacturing plant.

The factory's dozens of old main workshops are undergoing major reconstruction.

In the past, the factory's buildings and equipment were laid out according to the nature of a repair factory; the ongoing major reconstruction project will fundamentally change this situation.

It is estimated that after the completion of the reconstruction next year, this factory will be able to manufacture 270 locomotives and 2,500 freight cars annually.

This factory was built successively between 1907 and 1911, originally serving the Japanese invaders in repairing locomotives and vehicles. After 1930, the factory produced a small number of locomotives, but the locomotive boilers, cylinders, and main frames were all shipped from Japan.

Since liberation, with the help of the Soviet Union, the factory has been independently manufacturing MK1 locomotives since 1954; this type of locomotive has recently undergone further modifications. The first modified, modernized MK1 locomotive is about to be successfully trial-produced. In addition, the factory also independently designed and manufactured a new type of locomotive – the Peace-type locomotive – last year.

    向现代化的机车和货车制造厂迈进
    大连机车车辆厂大改建
    据新华社大连25日电　新华社记者顾铁风报道：古老的大连机车车辆制造工厂正在加快脚步向现代化的机车和货车制造工厂迈进。
    工厂的几十个古老的主要车间，正在进行大改建。
    工厂的厂房和设备，过去都是按照修理性质的工厂而布置的；正在进行的大改建工程，将从根本上改变这种状况。
    预计这座工厂在明年完成改建以后，它每年能制造二百七十台机车，两千五百辆货车。
    这个工厂是在1907年到1911年间陆续建成的，它原是为日本侵略者修理机车和车辆服务的。1930年以后，厂里曾经出产过台数很少的机车，但是机车的锅炉、气缸和主车架等，都是从日本运来的。
    解放以后，这个厂在苏联的帮助下，从1954年起独立制造冖ㄎ一机车；这种机车，最近又作了进一步改造。第一台改造过的现代化冖ㄎ一机车快要试制成功了。此外，这个厂还在去年独立设计、制造成功了新型的机车——和平型机车。
