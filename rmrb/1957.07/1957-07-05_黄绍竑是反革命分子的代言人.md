Huang Shaohong is a Spokesperson for Counter-Revolutionaries

To the Editor:

Huang Shaohong has consistently pretended to be a defender of socialist legality. In fact, as Mr. Chen Qiyuan said, he is speaking for counter-revolutionaries everywhere.

In March of this year, at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Huang Shaohong made a speech in which he cited a so-called "wrongful" case of "being buried at the bottom of the sea" from Longguan County, Hebei Province. I am now writing down the real situation as I know it, so that everyone can see if this is really a "wrongful" case? Who exactly is Huang Shaohong "appealing" for?

The person arrested in the case Huang Shaohong is referring to is Han Guoping, a teacher at the cadre amateur school in Longguan County, Hebei. In 1946, when Han Guoping was studying at Taiyuan Industrial School, he joined the Kuomintang and successively served as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch and the secretary of the district party headquarters. He organized a propaganda team, with himself as the captain, and carried out anti-communist and anti-communist propaganda on the streets and in cinemas of Taiyuan. After entering Fu Jen Catholic University in 1947, Han Guoping colluded with special agents such as Xing Lianzhong to undermine student movements. Xing Lianzhong was the secretary of the "Second Team of the Underground Work of the North China Suppression General Headquarters Pacification Vanguard Team" under the leadership of international spy Lei Zhenyuan and Kuomintang secret agent Diao Huarren. At Fu Jen Catholic University, Han Guoping often threatened progressive students with "communist bandits" and "Eighth Route Army," and monitored the activities of progressive students. During the reorganization of the class committee, Han Guoping attempted to control the organization and interfere, but his conspiracy was seen through by the masses and did not succeed. However, Han Guoping and Xing Lianzhong, along with a group of reactionary elements, were not reconciled and used shameless means such as threatening students to withdraw from the class committee, writing letters to intimidate progressive students, and beating the chairman of the class committee to search dormitories, to undermine the progressive class committee organization.

After Fan Guangdou, a progressive student at Fu Jen Catholic University, was arrested by the Kuomintang reactionary government, Yang Guanglie and Lu Zhifang rescued him. Han Guoping and Xing Lianzhong investigated those who rescued Fan Guangdou. As a result, Yang and Lu had to leave the school. Han Guoping's evil deeds at Fu Jen Catholic University are now being reported by those who were persecuted by him at the time, and also exposed by those who carried out these reactionary activities with Han Guoping.

After liberation, Han Guoping worked at the Liberal Arts Institute of Peking University and also served as a teacher at a street adult night school. Because he continued to spread various reactionary remarks, he was expelled from his unit in 1951. After working in Longguan County, Hebei, he continued to spread reactionary remarks, slandering the Party and the government, and used hooligan tactics to play with female students, with extremely vile behavior. The People's Government arrested him in August 1955, and the Longguan People's Court sentenced him to eight years in prison. Han Guoping's family was not reconciled and sought "justice" from Huang Shaohong. Huang Shaohong did not ask about the situation and asked the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to urge Hebei Province to handle it. After repeated urging, the Hebei Higher People's Court revoked the original judgment of the Longguan County People's Court in 1957. The local people were extremely dissatisfied. Gao Deling, a democratic figure in Longguan County, said: "If such people are educated and released, who will report counter-revolutionaries in the future?" Huang Shaohong, however, said at the CPPCC meeting that this was a "wrongful case."

Now I want to ask Huang Shaohong, should such backbone members of reactionary parties and groups be arrested and sentenced? As a people's representative, why are you so concerned about counter-revolutionaries, but ignore the opinions of the people, and insist on saying that it is "buried at the bottom of the sea?"

### 黄绍竑是反革命分子的代言人

    黄绍竑是反革命分子的代言人编辑同志：
    黄绍竑一直装作社会主义法制的维护者。事实上，正如陈其瑗先生说的，他是处处在为反革命说话。
    今年3月，全国政协第三次会议上，黄绍竑有一篇发言，曾经举出河北省龙关县一件“冤沉海底”的所谓“冤”案。现把我知道的真实情况写出来，请大家看看这是不是“冤”案？黄绍竑究竟是在替什么人“鸣冤”？
    黄绍竑所说的这件案子的被捕者，是河北龙关县干部业余学校教员韩国屏。韩国屏1946年在太原工业学校读书的时候，就参加国民党，先后担任国民党区分部书记和区党部书记，组织宣传队，自任队长，在太原街头和电影院里进行反共灭共的宣传。1947年韩国屏进入辅仁大学后，同特务分子邢连仲等勾结在一起，破坏学生运动。邢连仲是国际间谍雷震远和军统特务刁化仁领导下的“华北剿总戡乱先锋队地下工作第二队”的书记。韩国屏在辅仁大学，经常以“共匪”、“八路”威胁进步同学，监视进步学生的活动。班会改选时，韩国屏企图掌握这个组织，进行干涉，他的阴谋被群众识破，没有达到目的。但是韩国屏和邢连仲等一群反动分子并不甘心，就用威胁同学退出班会、写信恐吓进步学生和殴打班会主席，搜查宿舍等无耻手段，破坏进步的班会组织。
    辅仁大学进步学生范光斗被国民党反动政府逮捕以后，杨光烈、陆志芳即进行营救。韩国屏、邢连仲就追查营救范光斗的人。这样，杨、陆两人不得不离开学校。韩国屏在辅仁大学的这些恶迹，现在有当时被他迫害的人的检举；也有同韩国屏一起进行这些反动活动的人的揭发。
    解放以后，韩国屏曾经在北京大学文科研究所工作，还兼任某街头成人夜校的教员，因为他继续散布各种反动言论，在1951年被他所在的单位开除。到河北龙关县工作后，还是不断散布反动言论，污蔑党和政府，并且耍流氓手段，玩弄女学生，行为极端恶劣。人民政府即于1955年8月予以逮捕，并由龙关人民法院判处徒刑八年。韩国屏家属不甘心就找黄绍竑申“冤”。黄绍竑不问情况，要全国人民代表大会常务委员会催促河北省处理。在再三催促之下，河北高级人民法院于1957年撤销龙关县人民法院的原判。当地人民群众极为不满，龙关县民主人士高德陵说：像这样的人都教育释放，以后谁还检举反革命？黄绍竑却在政协会议上说这是个“冤案”。
    现在要问问黄绍竑，像韩国屏这样的反动党团骨干分子，要不要逮捕，该不该判刑？你身为人民代表，对反革命如此关心，对人民群众的意见却不加理睬，偏要说“冤沉海底”是什么道理？
