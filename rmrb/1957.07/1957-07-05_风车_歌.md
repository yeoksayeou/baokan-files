Windmill · Song
Li Geng

    Windmill
    Late at night, the windmill by the river is still creaking and groaning, singing a song of life.
    It never tires of its own labor, just as it never tires of its monotonous song. Although it has painted a brightly colored picture on the arid fields, it has never praised itself, but is proud of the river's flowing water. If you don't believe me, listen to its song: "Creak! It's the river water's merit! Creak..."
    When the land has absorbed enough water,
    When the seeds we have sown have sprouted;
    Only then does it rest by the river. When the land needs it for irrigation, it starts spinning again with a "creak, creak."
    Windmill, I have never heard your song praising yourself, nor have I heard you complaining.

     Sound
    How many dawns have been brought to me by the crowing of the cock.
    Today! I hear resounding chimes ringing in the dawn of each day.
    The chimes resound in every corner of the village, echoing across the vast fields. This boundless land! Following the clear chimes, a magnificent symphony begins: Old farmers driving their oxen, like playing the loudest keys; the roar of tractors, louder than the biggest stringed instrument...
    I have never been so moved by such sounds. Besides rejoicing that my own singing is also woven into these beautiful sounds, I complain that I am a poor singer.

              Song
    I want to weave all the spring flowers of the earth into a wreath and hang it on your chest.
    I want to compose all the greenery of the earth into a beautiful song, constantly ringing in your ears.
    The wreath will make the earth more beautiful, and the song will add vigor to this world. Look, the mountains are already dressed in green finery; because of your beauty, even the ever-changing colorful clouds cannot help but reveal a color of shame.
    It is you! Spring! The magical dyer descending upon the earth.
    Besides waking up all the birds to sing for you, what else can I use to express my feelings! Because the wreath and the spring song are all bestowed upon us by you.

    风车·歌
    李耕
    风车
    深夜，河边的风车，还在咿咿呀呀地响着，它在唱着一只生命之歌。
    它从不厌烦自己的劳累，像从不厌烦自己单调的歌声一样。它虽然在干涸的田野描绘了一幅色采鲜丽的图画，但它从没有夸赞自己，而为小河的流水骄傲。不信，你听它唱的歌：“咿呀！是河水的功劳呀！咿呀……”
    当土地吸够了它需要的水分，
    当我们播下的种子已经抽芽；
    这时，它才憩息在小河的边上。当土地需要它灌溉的时候，它又“咿咿呀呀”地旋转了起来。
    风车，我从没有听见你的歌在颂扬自己，也没有听见怨艾自己的声音。
     声音
    多少个黎明，给我送来一声声鸡的啼鸣。
    今天哟！我却听见一阵阵洪亮的钟声敲响了每一天的黎明。
    钟声，响遍了村庄的每一个角落，响彻在辽阔的田野上。这无际的土地啊！追随着朗朗的钟声，奏起了一支壮伟的交响曲：老农?喝着耕牛，像弹动着最响亮的琴键；拖拉机的轰鸣，响过最大的弦琴。……
    我从没有被这样的声音激动过。除了庆幸自己的歌声也编织在这优美的声音之中，我埋怨自己是一个低能的歌唱者。
              歌
    我要把大地所有的春花，编成一个花圈，挂在你的胸前。
    我要把大地所有的绿色，谱成一只优美的歌曲，常响在你的耳边。
    花圈，会使大地更美丽，歌声将使这个世界增添蓬勃的气色。不看，群山已经披上了绿色的盛装；由于你的绮丽，就是经常变幻的彩云也不能不流露出羞惭的颜色。
    是你啊！春天呀！这降临大地的神奇的染匠。
    除了唤醒百鸟为你唱歌，我还能用别的什么来表示我的心意呢！因为花圈和春天的歌，都是你赐给我们的。
