Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 18th. The Changchun Passenger Car Factory has recently started construction. At the construction site, which has just been established in the suburbs, the first group of factory workers has appeared, and they are first building the factory's water supply project.

The passenger cars manufactured by the Changchun Passenger Car Factory in the future will be exactly the same as the new Soviet passenger cars currently running on the Beijing-Moscow route, both soft-berth sleeping cars and hard-berth sleeping cars. This kind of passenger car is sturdy, beautiful, and especially suitable for long-distance travel. Its car body is longer, and the carriages are spacious, consisting of symmetrical upper and lower two-story four berths forming a single room. Each carriage has a boiler for water supply, and each room has electrical devices to regulate the air, which can ensure the comfort of passengers during the journey. The exterior of the car body is painted with bright green paint, which is very beautiful.

This factory is very large. According to its designed capacity, it can produce a passenger car in less than five hours and will be China's first largest modern passenger car manufacturing plant. The passenger cars manufactured by this factory will be much cheaper than importing the same type of passenger cars.

The engineering design and production process design of this factory are undertaken by Chinese engineering and technical personnel with the help of Soviet experts. The design work implemented the policy of thrift, and the factory construction investment will be reduced by nearly 40 million yuan.

This factory is scheduled to be completed and put into production in 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 18th. The steel frames of the largest workshop in the Changchun Locomotive Repair Factory under construction – the joint workshop – are being assembled, and other auxiliary projects are also under construction at the same time.

The Changchun Locomotive Repair Factory will specialize in repairing the railway's freight locomotives with the largest traction capacity and passenger locomotives with the fastest speed. It can overhaul 300 of these two types of locomotives annually. Such a specialized factory with such a large repair capacity does not currently exist in China.

When this factory started construction in early 1956, the locomotive repair capacity in Northeast China was insufficient, and some locomotives had to be sent to Guannei (the area south of the Great Wall) for repair over long distances. Due to the railway workers' special attention to protecting locomotives and strengthening regular maintenance work, the time between major locomotive overhauls has been greatly extended, alleviating the tension in locomotive repair in Northeast China. Therefore, this factory will be completed two or three years later than originally planned, in 1959.

    长春客车制造厂五小时能出产一辆新式客车  长春机车修理厂每年可大拆大卸机车三百台
    新华社长春18日电  长春客车制造厂最近开始动工兴建。在市郊刚刚形成的工地，出现了第一批建厂工人，他们首先建筑工厂的供水工程。
    长春客车制造厂将来制造的客车，同目前行驶在北京—莫斯科旅途上的苏联新型客车一模一样，都是软席寝车和硬席寝车。这种客车坚固、美观，特别适合长途旅行。它的车体较长，车厢宽敞，由对称上下二层四个铺位组成一个单间。每节有开水炉供水，每间有电气装置调解空气，可以保证旅客旅途生活舒适。车体外表涂饰鲜绿油漆，十分漂亮。
    这个工厂规模很大，按照设计能力，不到五小时就能出产一辆客车，将是我国第一个最大的现代化客车制造厂。这个工厂制造的客车，比进口同样客车的价格要低得多。
    这个工厂的工程设计和生产工艺设计，是在苏联专家帮助下由我国工程技术人员承担的。设计工作贯彻了节约方针，建厂投资减少将近四千万元。
    这个工厂计划在1959年建成并投入生产。
    新华社长春18日电  兴建中的长春机车修理厂最大的车间——联合车间的厂房钢架，正在组合装配，另外一些辅助工程也在同时施工。
    长春机车修理厂将专门修理铁路上牵引量最大的货运机车和跑得最快的客运机车。它每年可以大拆大卸修理这两种机车三百台。修理能力这样大的专业工厂，在我国目前还是没有的。
    1956年初开始建设这个工厂的时候，东北地区机车修理能力不足，有些机车不得不远途送往关内去修理。由于铁路工人特别注意保护机车，加强经常性的检修工作，机车大修之间的时间大大延长，缓和了东北地区机车修理的紧张情况。因此，这个工厂较原计划推后二、三年，将在1959年建成。
