Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 21st: Hunan Province, a well-known grain-producing area, has successively begun harvesting its 12 million mu of early rice. Reports of bumper harvests are pouring in, and the 32 million mu of mid-season rice and many other crops are also growing well. At present, farmers in some drought-affected areas are working day and night to draw water and combat the drought, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

According to the Communist Party of China’s Changde Local Committee, the yield of early rice in various counties of the Dongting Lake area is generally more than 400 jin per mu, with some reaching 600 to 700 jin. It is estimated that the early rice yield of the entire special district will increase by more than 10% compared to last year. The Shaoyang Special District and the hilly areas of southwestern Hunan, which suffered severe drought last year, have initially overcome the drought this year due to the construction of more than 600,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. Early rice in these areas is also expected to have a good harvest.

In the first harvest season after Hunan Province achieved advanced agricultural cooperation, hundreds of vehicles, boats, and ships are busy day and night transporting agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other materials needed for summer harvesting and planting along the water and land transportation lines in the Xiangjiang River basin and the Dongting Lake area, the main double-cropping rice production areas. The boundless golden rice fields of Dongting Lake are undulating in the wind. Villages are busy repairing granaries and cleaning threshing grounds. The sound of threshing, "dong, dong," is becoming more and more frequent on the vast fertile fields.

This year, Hunan Province's cotton, hemp, and other crops are also expected to increase in production. Yuanjiang County, which accounts for about two-thirds of the province's ramie planting area, will have a total output exceeding last year's by about 40%, and the quality will be better than in any previous year. The cotton in the plains of Changde, Linli, and Lixian counties is also growing particularly luxuriantly.

### 湖南开镰割稻一片打谷声

    湖南开镰割稻一片打谷声
    据新华社长沙21日电　著名的粮食产区湖南省，一千二百多万亩早稻已陆续开镰收割，丰收捷报频传，三千二百多万亩中稻和其他许多农作物也生长良好。现在部分受旱地区农民正日夜车水抗旱，争取全面丰收。
    据中共常德地方委员会了解，洞庭湖区各县的早稻一般每亩产量都在四百斤以上，高的达六、七百斤，估计全专区早稻将比去年增产一成多。去年遭受严重旱灾的邵阳专区和湘西南等丘陵山区，今年因为兴修了六十多万处小型农田水利工程，初步战胜了旱灾，现在这些地区的早稻也可望丰收。
    在湖南省实现农业高级合作化后的第一个收获季节里，在双季稻主要产区湘江流域和洞庭湖滨地区一带水陆交通线上，成百上千的舟车轮船正日夜不停地忙着赶运夏收夏种所需的农具、肥料等物资。洞庭湖滨一望无垠的金黄色稻禾，迎风起伏。村落里到处在整修粮仓和打扫晒谷坪场。广阔的沃野上，“咚咚”鸣响的扮禾声，一天比一天多起来了。
    今年湖南省棉、麻和其他一些农作物也都可望增产。占全省种植面积约三分之二的沅江县的苎麻，总产量将超过去年百分之四十左右，质量胜过过去任何一年。常德、临澧和澧县平原上的棉花，也长得特别茂盛。
