    The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Small Group of the RCCK continued yesterday, Sunday, despite the hot weather. Zhu Yunshan presided over the meeting. Among the sixty-nine attendees, ten people including Xu Baoju, Huang Shaohong, Qu Wu, Li Shizhang, Chen Jianchen, Zhang Keming, Lu Yuwen, Su Congzhou, Nie Hong, and Gan Cisen spoke. The meeting focused on criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of rightists such as Long Yun and Huang Shaohong.
Tan Tiwu and Lin Xiling Formed a "Defensive Alliance"

    Although Huang Shaohong admitted in his self-criticism that his thinking was reactionary, the content of his self-criticism was empty and did not address specific facts. This cunning attitude of Huang Shaohong aroused dissatisfaction among the participants. Speakers at the meeting believed that Huang Shaohong was a two-faced schemer and sophist, and his empty self-criticism showed that he was trying to muddle through. In particular, his relationship with Tan Tiwu and Lin Xiling was not mentioned at all in his self-criticism, which made people even more suspicious of their conspiracies. Therefore, everyone unanimously demanded that Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu explain their political relationship with Lin Xiling. Huang Shaohong deliberately avoided answering this question, and Tan Tiwu claimed illness and did not attend the meeting. Xu Baoju revealed in writing the trick of forming a "defensive alliance" with Lin Xiling on the phone. She asked Lin Xiling to conduct a self-criticism according to her intentions, and told Lin Xiling to write down the questions raised by the RCCK when investigating their relationship in duplicate, one copy to be sent to Chairman Li Jishen personally, and one copy to be sent to Tan Tiwu herself. Tan Tiwu's sneaky behavior is worthy of attention.
Long Yun's Hostile Emotions and Anti-Soviet Remarks

    Xu Baoju criticized Long Yun, saying that Long Yun had repeatedly made erroneous and even reactionary remarks, which was not a matter of ideology, but a matter of standing on the position of big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Before liberation, Long Yun ruled the people of Yunnan and lived an extremely luxurious life by exploiting them. After liberation, his life changed significantly. The land no longer belonged to him, and he could no longer ride roughshod over the people. Therefore, he was dissatisfied with the Party and the socialist system. He hated land reform and the policy of agricultural collectivization, and interpreted the rectification as rectifying Communist Party members. It can be said that Long Yun viewed all the government's policies with the hostile emotions of a landlord class that had not been properly reformed.

    Xu Baoju believed that the concentrated expression of Long Yun's reactionary thinking was opposition to the Soviet Union. Long Yun wanted to settle accounts with the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union was not as generous as the United States, and said that this was out of his "patriotism," which was extremely absurd. Xu Baoju said that since the founding of our country, the Soviet Union has provided our country with enormous and selfless assistance in political, economic, cultural, and other fields. These facts are obvious to all and well-known. Why can't Long Yun see or hear them?
Tan Tiwu and Huang Shaohong Echoed Each Other

    Li Shizhang said that if Huang Shaohong only gave a general outline, then Tan Tiwu's speech concretized it for him. Huang Shaohong opposed the Party directly issuing calls and instructions. In addition to agreeing with this opinion, Tan Tiwu also proposed a method: that the Communist Party abolish all departments and establish various committees within the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), establish Party groups within the Standing Committee of the NPC, and absorb non-Party members to participate in the work. Huang Shaohong criticized the judiciary, procuratorate, and lawyers for not playing a role in mutual restraint at the CPPCC inspection work symposium. Tan Tiwu pointed out that in order to make these three play a role in mutual restraint, they cannot be led by a single Party committee. Huang Shaohong said, "Emphasizing achievements will cover up shortcomings," and Tan Tiwu scolded Lu Yuwen as "insincere" and "disloyal to the Party and the country." Huang Shaohong said, "I don't know how many people are displaced and their families are ruined across the country," and Tan Tiwu vividly cited two cases at the RCCK Central Committee Small Group symposium, attempting to prove that our society is even more gloomy and terrifying than Huang Shaohong said. Huang Shaohong criticized our judicial organs for wrongly or severely sentencing many cases, and Tan Tiwu simply said that our government is lawless, slandering the Communist Party for making laws but not abiding by them, and demanding that the CPC Central Committee check which policies are "unconstitutional." At first, I didn't understand why Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu were so consistent and sang so "well" together? Yesterday, after reading the news published in the People's Daily, I suddenly realized that when Lin Xiling lived in Tan Tiwu's house, Huang Shaohong had talked with her for four hours. I demand that Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu thoroughly explain their relationship with Lin Xiling, and thoroughly explain how you carried out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies together!
New Material on Huang Shaohong's Reactionary Remarks

    Saying that farmers want to rebel, saying that students welcome Ge Peiqi
    He believes that Lin Xiling's reactionary "bravery" is admirable

    Qu Wu said that he often heard people say that Huang Shaohong was a schemer and two-faced. For example, in his conversation with us at the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on June 8, in the presence of Shao Lizi and Li Shucheng, he made three remarks that can reveal his reactionary face.

    He said to Shao Lizi: "The world is not peaceful, it is not the intellectuals who are rebelling, the problem lies with the farmers." From this reactionary remark of his, it can be inferred that what he called the world being unpeaceful was not the rebellion of intellectuals, but the rebellion of farmers. But judging from the fact that farmers are living and working in peace and contentment today, in the past half century, has there ever been such peace? What he said about being unpeaceful is completely untrue and simply a rumor to confuse the public. Perhaps the farmers Huang Shaohong referred to were not real farmers. At that time, I asked him: Where is the proof that farmers are rebelling? He said it was from letters, but whose letters are these? It should also be explained.

    Li Shucheng pointed to the material exposing Ge Peiqi in the People's Daily on June 8 and said that Ge Peiqi would not be able to teach at Renmin University any longer. But Huang Shaohong said instead that the students welcomed Ge Peiqi because Ge Peiqi had a following among the students. Huang Shaohong was very vivid when he said this, and from his expression, he fully expressed his sympathy for Ge Peiqi's reactionary remarks.

    Secondly, he also said to the three of us: Lin Xiling, this young female student, looks unremarkable, but she speaks eloquently and is not afraid to openly oppose the leadership of the Party, which is admirable. Huang Shaohong admires Lin Xiling's courage to oppose the leadership of the Party and has boundless sympathy for her. Qu Wu once asked him where he met Lin Xiling? Huang Shaohong said that Lin Xiling came to visit him. But yesterday's newspaper said that Lin Xiling lived in Tan Tiwu's house, and Huang Shaohong had talked with her for four hours. This proves that Huang Shaohong is lying, and he has seen Lin Xiling more than once. But why doesn't he answer this question in his self-criticism today? How did Huang Shaohong encourage her courage, and how did he provide her with materials? What is the political relationship? Huang Shaohong should explain thoroughly. Qu Wu said that some people say that the rightists in the schools echo the rightists outside the schools. In fact, they are not only echoing each other, but also carrying out a planned conspiracy to oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party.
Huang Shaohong Specially Likes to Deal with Counter-Revolutionary Criminals, and Echoes Whatever Criminals Cry Out

    Nie Hong said that he could not agree with Huang Shaohong's so-called "self-criticism." He believed that Huang Shaohong's self-criticism was evading the important and dwelling on the trivial, empty and meaningless, and wearing a pile of hats, but he did not mention a word about the specific facts and activities of opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the Party. Then, Nie Hong made a new exposure of Huang Shaohong's willingness to serve counter-revolutionary elements.

    Nie Hong said that Huang Shaohong made the judiciary look completely dark when he inspected the judiciary, and made the education look completely dark when he inspected education. Huang Shaohong never approached the workers and peasants in his inspections, but specially liked to deal with counter-revolutionary criminals, and echoed whatever counter-revolutionary criminals cried out. Our prisons' humanitarian treatment of prisoners is recognized by people at home and abroad, but Huang Shaohong said that the prisoners here do not eat well and the prisoners there do not live well. May I ask what Huang Shaohong gave them to eat and how they lived in the prisons under his rule when Huang Shaohong was the puppet governor of Guangxi Province and the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province (not to mention who was imprisoned)? He questioned whether Huang Shaohong had expressed the slightest opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's bloody policy of "better to kill a thousand innocent people than to let one guilty person go"?

    Nie Hong questioned Huang Shaohong: Is the work of the RCCK to take in and cultivate counter-revolutionary criminals who have served their sentences?

    Nie Hong also revealed that Huang Shaohong said at a meeting of the RCCK Central Committee: "In my two years of inspecting judicial work, I found that 80% of the criminals are related to the Kuomintang... Many of them are middle-level and related to the old Kuomintang. They will be released after serving their sentences, and in a few years there will be a large number of them. I think the responsibility for helping them will fall on us." Huang Shaohong also openly asked the RCCK to defend the arrested members. Speaking of this, Nie Hong angrily questioned Huang Shaohong: Is the work of the RCCK to take in and cultivate counter-revolutionary criminals who have served their sentences? What kind of party do you want to turn the RCCK into, and where are you trying to lead the RCCK?

    Finally, Nie Hong demanded that Huang Shaohong thoroughly explain his underground activities that could not be seen in the light of day.

    Gan Cisen said that the late RCCK Vice Chairman Tan Pingshan had told him an anecdote about Huang Shaohong: In the winter of 1948, RCCK Chairman Li Jishen and some other RCCK members living in Hong Kong were going to the liberated areas to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference. Huang Shaohong specially rushed to Hong Kong to dissuade Li Jishen from going north and asked him to go to Wuhan, which was then occupied by Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, to "preside over the overall situation." This shows that he did not want to go to the liberated areas at that time. Later, because the overall situation was settled, he came to the liberated areas.
Another Example of Huang Shaohong Luring Young Students

    Gan Cisen said that Huang Shaohong lured young students and also revealed another example. Last autumn, when he went to Nanjing to pay homage to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Huang Shaohong also "smuggled" a female student from the Russian Language Institute, Zhang Xinrong, who went by train and plane, obviously adding a "VIP." This female student did not ask the school for leave when she went to Nanjing. The school wanted to expel her, but because Huang Shaohong supported her, she was not expelled. Since then, Zhang Xinrong's political image has become more and more suspicious. She boasted to others that Huang Shaohong trusted her and showed her all the documents, letting her help deal with letters from the people. During this rectification, Zhang Xinrong made seven political demands to the school, advocating that the school hold accusation meetings to allow those who were purged to accuse at the meetings, and to make all the archives public. Therefore, Gan Cisen asked Huang Shaohong why he was interested in these young female students, what exactly he had instigated them, and which students he had lured and incited, and should explain.

    民革中央小组扩大会议
    揭露黄绍竑的阴谋家嘴脸
    要求黄绍竑、谭惕吾交代同林希翎的政治关系
    本报讯　昨天是星期日，天气也很热，民革中央小组扩大会议还是继续举行。会议由朱蕴山主持。到会的六十九人中，有许宝驹、黄绍竑、屈武、李世璋、陈建晨、张克明、卢郁文、苏从周、聂轰、甘祠森等十人发言。会议集中批判龙云、黄绍竑等右派分子的反动言行。谭惕吾林希翎互订“攻守同盟”
    黄绍竑在检讨中，虽然承认了他的思想是反动的，但检讨的内容却空空洞洞，没有交代具体的事实。黄绍竑这种狡猾的态度引起了大家的不满，在会上发言的人都认为黄绍竑是一个心口不一致的阴谋家和诡辩家，从他的空洞检讨中，可以看出来他是想蒙混过关；特别是他和谭惕吾同林希翎的关系，在检讨中只字未提，使人对他们的阴谋诡计更加怀疑。因此，大家一致要求黄绍竑、谭惕吾交代他们同林希翎的政治关系。黄绍竑故意避开答复这个问题，谭惕吾称病没有出席这次会议。许宝骙在会上用书面揭发了她同林希翎在电话中订“攻守同盟”的诡计，她要林希翎按照她的意图进行检讨，并将民革向林希翎调查她们之间的关系的几个问题，告诉林希翎写成一式两份，一份寄给李济深主席亲启，一份寄给谭惕吾本人。谭惕吾这种鬼祟的作法，是值得引起人们注意的。龙云的仇恨情绪和反苏言论
    许宝驹对龙云提出批评。他说，龙云屡次发表错误的甚至反动的言论，不是思想问题，而是站在大地主、大资产阶级的立场问题，解放前，龙云一直统治着云南人民，靠着剥削云南人民，过着极度豪华的生活。解放后，他的生活起了显著变化，土地不再属于他所有，也不能骑在人民头上作威作福了。因而他就对党不满，对社会主义制度不满。他仇视土地改革，仇视农业集体化政策，把整风体会为整共产党员。可以说龙云是以一个没有改造好的地主阶级的仇恨情绪，来看待政府的一切方针政策的。
    许宝驹认为，龙云反动思想的集中表现是反对苏联。龙云要同苏联算账，说苏联没有美国慷慨，并且说这是出于他的“爱国心”，真是荒谬到极点。许宝驹说，自我国建国以来，苏联在政治、经济、文化等各个方面给予了我国巨大的无私的援助，这些事实是有目共睹的、尽人皆知的，为什么龙云竟会看不见听不到呢？谭惕吾和黄绍竑互相呼应
    李世璋说，如果说黄绍竑只是提纲挈领地说了一下，那么，谭惕吾的发言，便替他具体化了。黄绍竑反对党直接发号召发指示，谭惕吾除了同意这意见外，更提出一条办法：就是共产党取消各个部，在人大常委会内设立各种委员会，在人大常委会内设立党组，吸收非党人士参加工作。黄绍竑在政协视察工作座谈会上批评司法、检察、律师没有发挥互相制约的作用，谭惕吾指出要使这三者发挥互相制约的作用，就不能由一个党委领导。黄绍竑说，“强调成绩就会掩盖缺点”，谭惕吾就大骂卢郁文是“言不由衷”“对党不实，对国不忠。”黄绍竑说“全国范围内不知道有多少人流离失所，家破人亡”，谭惕吾就在民革中央小组座谈会上，绘声绘色地举出两个案件，企图证明我们的社会比黄绍竑所说的还更阴森可怕。黄绍竑批评我们的司法机关把许多案子判错、判重了，谭惕吾就干脆说我们的政府无法无天，污蔑共产党立法而不守法，要求中共中央检查那些政策“违宪”了。起初，我还不了解黄绍竑和谭惕吾两人为什么会这样一致，唱得这样“好”？昨天看了人民日报登载的消息，才恍然大悟，原来林希翎住在谭惕吾家的时候，黄绍竑曾去和她谈过四个小时。我要求黄绍竑和谭惕吾彻底交代同林希翎的关系，彻底交代你们怎样在一起进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动！
    黄绍竑反动言论的新材料
    说农民要造反，说学生欢迎葛佩琦
    他认为林希翎反动的“勇敢”值得钦佩
    屈武说，过去常听人说黄绍竑是一个阴谋家，心口不一致。如他在6月8日在人大常委会和我们的谈话，在座的有邵力子和李书城，他有三句话，可以看出他的反动面目。
    他对邵力子说过：“天下不太平了，并不是知识分子造反，问题是在农民。”从他这句反动的话里可以引证出来，他所谓的天下不太平，不是知识分子造反，当然是说农民造反了。可是从现在农民安居乐业来说，在近半个世纪以来，有没有今天的太平呢？他所说的不太平，完全不是事实，简直是谣言惑众。也许黄绍竑指的农民不是真正的农民。当时我就问过他：你说农民造反，从哪证明？他说是从来信中，可是这些来信，是谁的来信？也应当交代。
    李书城当时指着人民日报6月8日揭露葛佩琦的材料说，这一下葛佩琦在人民大学教不下去了。但黄绍竑反而说，学生欢迎葛佩琦，因为葛佩琦在学生中有群众。黄绍竑当时说这句话时绘声绘色，从他的表情看，完全表现他同情葛佩琦的反动言论。
    其次，他向我们三人还说过：林希翎这个年轻女学生，看上去其貌不扬，但是谈吐风生，公然反对党的领导并不害怕，值得钦佩。黄绍竑很佩服林希翎的反对党的领导的勇气，对她寄予无限的同情。屈武曾经问过他，在哪见到林希翎？黄绍竑说是林希翎来访问他的。但是昨天报上说林希翎住在谭惕吾的家里，黄绍竑曾和她谈过四小时。这就证明黄绍竑是说假话，他不只一次见过林希翎。但是在他的今天检讨中，为什么不答复这个问题？黄绍竑如何鼓励她的勇气，又如何供给她材料？在政治上是什么关系？黄绍竑应彻底交代。屈武说，有人说学校里的右派分子同校外的右派分子相互呼应，其实他们不仅是相互呼应，而且是有计划地进行反对社会主义和反对党的领导的阴谋。
    黄绍竑专门喜欢跟反革命罪犯打交道，一听罪犯喊冤就随声附和
    聂轰表示不能同意黄绍竑的所谓“检讨”。他认为黄绍竑的检讨是避重就轻、空洞无物，戴了一堆帽子，可是对反社会主义、反对党的领导的具体事实和活动却一字不提。接着，聂轰对黄绍竑勇于为反革命分子服务的情况作了新的揭发。
    聂轰说，黄绍竑视察司法就把司法说得漆黑一团，视察教育就把教育说得漆黑一团。黄绍竑在视察中从不接近工农群众，专门喜欢跟反革命罪犯打交道，一听见反革命罪犯喊冤就随声附和。我们的监狱对待犯人的人道主义待遇是中外人士所承认的，但黄绍竑却说这里的犯人吃得不好，那里的犯人住得不好，试问在黄绍竑做伪广西省主席和伪浙江省主席的时候，在他治下的监狱里
  （且不说关的是什么人），黄绍竑给他们吃的什么？住得怎样？他质问黄绍竑对蒋介石的“宁可错杀一千，不可放过一个”的血腥政策，是否表示过丝毫反对呢？
  聂轰质问黄绍竑：难道民革的工作就是收容培养服过刑的反革命罪犯吗？
    聂轰又揭露，黄绍竑在民革中央的一次会议上说：“我在二年的视察司法工作中，发现80％的罪犯同国民党有关……他们很多是中层，同旧国民党有关的，刑满后就要出来，过几年就有很大数量，这批人将来出来，我看帮助他们的责任就要落在我们身上。”黄绍竑还公开要民革要替被捕的成员进行辩护。说到这里，聂轰气愤地质问黄绍竑说：难道民革的工作就是收容、培养服过刑的反革命罪犯吗？你要把民革变成一个什么样子的党，企图把民革引向何处去？
    最后，聂轰要求黄绍竑把他在阴暗的角落积极进行的见不得天日的活动彻底交代。
    甘祠森说，已故的民革副主席谭平山曾对他讲过黄绍竑的一件往事：1948年冬，住在香港的民革主席李济深和其他一些民革成员要到解放区参加新政协，黄绍竑特地赶到香港劝阻李济深北上，要他到李宗仁、白祟禧当时占据的武汉去“主持大计”。由此可见，他当时并不想到解放区。后来因为大局已定，他才到了解放区。黄绍竑诱惑青年学生的又一个例子
    甘祠森说，黄绍竑诱惑青年学生，还揭露另一个例子，就是在去年的秋天到南京谒中山陵时，黄绍竑还“夹带”了一位俄语学院的女学生张新荣，火车来，飞机去，显然增加了一个“贵宾”。这位女学生去南京没向学校请假，学校要开除她，因为背后有黄绍竑撑腰，没有开除。从此以后，张新荣的政治面目就一天天可疑起来了。她向人自夸说黄绍竑信任她，什么文件都给她看，让她帮助处理人民来信。这次整风时，张新荣向学校提了七条政治要求，主张学校开控诉大会，让那些被肃反的对象到大会上去控诉，并要把全部档案公开出来。因此甘祠森问黄绍竑为什么对这些年轻女学生有兴趣，究竟对她们教唆了一些什么？还诱惑并煽动过那些学生，应当交代出来。
