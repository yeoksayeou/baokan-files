    The Betrayal of the Shanghai China Democratic League
    By Our Correspondents Ji Yin and Zhang Jing

    In its editorial, "The Bourgeois Orientation of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized," this newspaper pointed out: "The role played by the China Democratic League in the Hundred Flowers Campaign and the rectification process was particularly egregious. Organized, planned, with a program and a line, they were all alienated from the people, anti-Communist and anti-socialist."

    The situation of the Shanghai China Democratic League is precisely like this.

    As the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai gradually deepened and unfolded, people saw more and more clearly in the large amount of materials exposing the anti-Party activities of the Rightists, an important fact, that is, the leading organs of the Shanghai China Democratic League were a major command center, a Rightist base camp, in this attack by the Rightists against the Party. Many bullets that viciously shot at the Party were fired from this corner.

    People discovered from the leading members of the Shanghai China Democratic League that the leadership group of the Shanghai China Democratic League had in fact become a Rightist group, and the Rightists had seized the leading power of the Shanghai China Democratic League. It has now been ascertained that more than half of the leadership group of the Shanghai China Democratic League are Rightists. But the importance does not lie in the quantity, but in the fact that these half are all people who are responsible for actual leadership work. Chen Renbing is the deputy director and secretary-general who leads both the leading organs and the grass-roots work. Peng Wenyin is the deputy director who is in charge of education and women's work. The Rightist Sun Siming is the deputy secretary-general who is actually in charge of the work of the China Democratic League in the municipal party committee. They formed the actual leadership core of the Shanghai China Democratic League Municipal Committee, and in this great storm of the Party's rectification movement, they turned the political direction of the Shanghai China Democratic League onto a dangerous road of anti-Party and anti-socialism.

    Recruiting Troops and Buying Horses, Prepared Long Ago

    It has been ascertained that the Shanghai China Democratic League's rampant attack on the Party this time had been actively organized and prepared as early as a year ago, and the main thing was to desperately expand the ranks and strengthen the Rightist forces. A year ago, the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." Zhang Bojun, the Rightist leader of the China Democratic League, shouted in Beijing: "The China Democratic League has a lot to offer. The democratic parties should develop at least one or two million people..." This call received a positive response from the Shanghai China Democratic League, which was manipulated by the Rightists. Since then, they began to "develop greatly" at all costs. They tried their best to oppose the division of labor among the democratic parties in the development of targets, and put forward the slogan of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their magical powers." They urged the China Democratic League branch members in various literary and art groups to quickly recruit League members, saying that "if you recruit slowly, you will be recruited by other parties." They criticized the former literary and art district branch for being too "conservative" in developing the organization. Later, Chen Renbing and others simply went out themselves, abandoning the grass-roots organizations and going deep into various departments to conduct "personal contacts."

    The political ambitions hidden behind this "great development" of the Shanghai China Democratic League were fully exposed in their various despicable activities. They had two "focuses" or two main goals in this "great development." The first goal was to "attack famous brands" (in their terms, it was called "grabbing famous brands"). Chen Renbing often said: "As long as we win over those well-known people in unit ××, the situation will be ours." In order to grab famous brands, they can spare no expense and use all kinds of despicable means such as visiting, inviting to dinner, and picking up and dropping off by car. They even promised that they could not swear an oath, write an autobiography, or attend any meetings as conditions. Dong Ailin, a famous singer in Shanghai, was once identified as a development target. Chen Renbing first repeatedly invited her to participate in seminars through others' relationships, and invited her to dinner. Dong Ailin refused several times. Finally, Dong was forced to agree to his invitation once. He boasted at the banquet that he loved music, and then showed off to Dong Ailin that "we have Ding Shi'e in Shanghai opera, Qi Yaxian in Yue opera, and... in Beijing opera, but there are fewer League members in the music industry, especially in singing, so I hope you famous singers can also participate..." These words aroused Dong Ailin's strong disgust. She refused to join the China Democratic League at that time, but Chen Renbing did not give up. A week later, he ran to Dong Ailin's home to mobilize her to join the League. When Dong Ailin flatly refused, Chen Renbing still shamelessly said: "I hope this is not the final decision, please consider it again." Chen Renbing also used all his flattery skills on Beijing opera actors Yan Huizhu, Tong Zhiling, etc. In order to win over the famous painter Liu Haisu to join the League, they even included him in the municipal committee member before Liu joined the League, probably as a condition for joining the League.

    The second focus of the "great development" of the Shanghai China Democratic League was to "open the door to the backward." They went everywhere to find those who were dissatisfied with the Party, and consciously asked them to hold seminars, beautifying it as representing the "interests" of intellectuals, but in fact they were looking for development targets from them as capital to attack the Party. In December last year, at the "Shanghai Film Studio" five seminars presided over by Chen Renbing alone, there were two such things: Chen Renbing saw that Shu Xiuwen had not filmed any movies in recent years, and estimated that she must have opinions on the leaders of Shanghai Film Studio, so he deliberately invited her to participate in the seminar, taking the opportunity to win her over to join the League. Unexpectedly, Shu Xiuwen not only did not complain at the seminar, but said a few fair words for Shanghai Film Studio, believing that the achievements of Shanghai Film Studio in the past seven years could not be denied. This greatly disappointed Chen Renbing, and he never paid attention to Shu Xiuwen again. He told people that "developing Shu Xiuwen means that the League is to be separated from the masses." At those five seminars, another actor, Fang Shan, was very opposed to the leadership because she was dissatisfied with the rating, and said that the Communist Party had no democracy and only the China Democratic League had warmth, and expressed that she wanted to join the China Democratic League. Chen Renbing was very proud when he heard this, and immediately approved her to join the League. Someone in the League opposed his approach, but he said: "It is very beneficial for us to absorb such people." Around those five seminars, the League members of Shanghai Film Studio suddenly developed from seven to thirty-three. Some people call this kind of blitz development of the organization "joining the League on the front line." That is to say, these people have been "tested" in the battle with the Communist Party. They are reliable "comrades."

    In addition to large-scale development, the Rightists also paid attention to cultivating the League's backbone in various departments and setting up strongholds. Wu Yin of "Shanghai Film Studio" and Zhang Manping of "People's Art Theater" were all trusted aides reused by the Rightists. They all played the role of strongholds in this arson.

    Through these methods, the Shanghai China Democratic League organization expanded from 900 people to 3,400 people in just one year, an increase of more than three times. Among them, of course, there are many good people who joined the League with legitimate wishes, but in many grass-roots units, the China Democratic League group or branch has become a small group of backward elements and frustrated elements. Their organizational life is to complain, scold the leaders, and even carry out anti-Party activities. The task of ideological transformation has long been thrown to the clouds. More suspiciously, the Shanghai China Democratic League also absorbed some counter-revolutionaries and people with unclear histories into the League. In the Shanghai judicial department, two historical counter-revolutionaries who were convicted were developed into League members. This is undoubtedly the goal expected by the Shanghai China Democratic League Municipal Committee Rightist ambitious figures.

    Swearing-in Ceremony, Full of Murderous Intent

    In May of this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to launch a rectification movement and proposed that all democratic parties help the Party rectify itself. The Shanghai China Democratic League Rightists, with ulterior motives, thought that the world had changed drastically and that they could take the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Party. Therefore, on May 14, they convened a city-wide China Democratic League cadre meeting to instigate the China Democratic League organizations in all units to open fire on the Party. The meeting was presided over by the Rightist Peng Wenyin. As soon as he stepped onto the podium, he said: "Today is a swearing-in ceremony, a democratic march..." Swearing in to whom? Marching to whom? Needless to say, the target is of course the Party leaders at all levels. Shen Zhiyuan, who has always been upright and self-proclaimed as a "scholar," completely changed his murderous face at this meeting. He made a long and inflammatory report in an unprecedentedly "passionate" and "indignant" posture. The report almost exhausted all vicious words to carry out extremely blatant slander and injury to the Communist Party. He slandered the personnel department as "sneaky, closing the door, and monopolizing political work..." He exaggerated the division between the Party and non-Party members in some units into "thick walls of reinforced concrete" or "deep ditches that cannot be crossed" and "cannot communicate with each other." He viciously said under the general hat of "long-term rule of dogmatism" that "our academic ideas and free ideas have almost reached the fate of suffocation and death. Therefore, our academic circles have appeared very silent in the past eight years since liberation. There is no independent thinking, and there is no air of free debate. That is to say, our academic circles have no life and no vitality." He also exaggerated the phenomenon of non-Party members having positions but no power in a general and unanalyzed way, and then shouted a series of sensational slogans with ulterior motives: "We want to speak, we want to criticize these people, we want to oppose these people!" "We must demand that if we have a position, we must have a power suitable for this position, and at the same time demand trust suitable for this power!" "No one has the right to infringe on our responsibilities and our rights!" Not only that, he repeatedly emphasized in the report that it is necessary to "conduct a comprehensive inspection of the ideas, styles, measures, and systems of every department and every unit... etc. under the socialist system." He wanted everyone to "treat the previous systems, guidelines, and policies with a critical spirit, and don't be afraid of one-sidedness, just put them forward." He also said very definitely: "Those outdated, unreasonable, and inconsistent systems with the requirements of the current situation" must be "resolutely and thoroughly eliminated." Finally, he was still afraid that everyone would not have the courage to "dispatch" and "march," and repeatedly patted his chest to guarantee to support everyone. After this "mobilization" by Shen Zhiyuan, a raging fire was ignited in the hearts of the four hundred League member cadres. Those who originally had some opinions on the Party were provoked by him. Those who originally leaned towards the Party also had a layer of doubt in their hearts. When they took the "torches" taught by Shen Zhiyuan and returned to their units, a dark cloud of anti-Party and anti-socialism rolled in the sky over Shanghai.

    Full Mobilization, Five-way Offensive

    Just after this swearing-in ceremony, the Shanghai China Democratic League's organizations at all levels launched a full-scale attack on the Party. Among them, five aspects were the focus of their attack, namely the drama and music circles, the film industry, higher education, the judiciary, and the press. These aspects were directly responsible by the main personnel of the China Democratic League. Chen Renbing and Peng Wenyin took the lead in the literary and art departments. They set "fire" in Shanghai Film Studio, People's Art Theater, Beijing Opera Theater, Chinese Painting Academy, Quyi circles, and Pingtan circles. The fire in "Shanghai Film Studio" and "People's Art Theater" burned the earliest and the most fiercely. Zhang Lide, Zhang Manping and other Rightists in "People's Art Theater" forced the leaders to admit "sectarianism," instigated the actors to break up and form another theater troupe, and refused the leaders to start improving their work. The Rightists scolded the Chinese Painting Academy as "unspeakable, a mess, a mess," and proposed not to have the Chinese Painting Academy. The Pingtan and Quyi circles also set off a wave of salary and welfare troubles... Xu Jie, Dai Jiaxiang and Sun Dayu also took actions in the universities. Xu Jie, the person in charge of the China Democratic League East China Normal University branch, convened a meeting of the China Democratic League group in the Chinese Department. At the meeting, they insulted the Party General Branch Secretary of the Chinese Department as a "foreman" and proposed that the "Party should withdraw from the Chinese Department," "the Party Committee should be abolished in the school," and "the China Democratic League should enjoy the same status as the Party Committee." And led the students of the third grade of the Chinese Department where he was located to organize a so-called "Rectification Preparatory Committee," beautifying it as "helping the Party rectify itself," but did not allow the comrades of the Party General Branch to participate. They drew cartoons and posted big-character posters, scolding Party members as "secret agents" and "阎罗王," and even proposed that non-Party personnel should convene "rectification meetings" to lead the Party's rectification.

    Dai Jiaxiang, a China Democratic League member of the History Department of the same school, used the pseudonym "Chu Ge" and posted a "Letter to All Students," saying that "the three major isms are brothers born of the same mother, and this mother is the Communist Party's autocracy and centralization, which causes the people to have no freedom, no democracy, inequality between people, and no guarantee of personal survival..." He called on the students to "rise up" and "oppose the Communist Party's autocracy and centralization."

    In another corner, the sound of guns in the judicial work also sounded. The Shanghai China Democratic League Municipal Committee held a judicial work seminar on May 18 with more than 30 people participating. It maliciously launched a crazy slander, attack, and rumor that the Shanghai First Intermediate People's Court had wrongly judged 34% of the social suppression of counter-revolutionaries cases, saying that "the current judges can legislate at will and judge as they want," "there are still muddle-headed officials who disregard human life," and at the same time they pointed the attack at the judicial workers from worker and peasant backgrounds, satirizing them for "having no culture," "not even being able to write judgments," and provoking the relationship between the Party and intellectuals in the judicial department, saying that the Party's policy towards intellectuals in the judicial department was "utilization, restriction, and transformation." ... The China Democratic League Rightists were extremely satisfied with this attack, and greatly praised Li Guoji and Liu Heping for making slanderous remarks, asked Li Guoji to sign for souvenir, invited them to dinner, and said to Liu: "If anyone wants you to review, you can write a manuscript to the Organization Department of the Municipal Committee (of the China Democratic League)."

    On the news front, Shen Zhiyuan, Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, and Lu Yi all joined the battle.

    In this way, the Shanghai China Democratic League Rightists were stirring up trouble everywhere, issuing all the ugliest and most vicious curses, and not allowing others to come out to say a fair word or talk about the achievements of the work. In May, the wild fire that the Shanghai China Democratic League Rightists ignited was burning with black smoke everywhere, and the world changed color. The China Democratic League Rightists, who were overwhelmed by anti-communist frenzy, wrongly estimated the situation. Dai Jiaxiang, a China Democratic League Rightist, vividly expressed their mood at the time. One day, he ran excitedly to the student dormitory and said to a group of students: "Are there any Party members here? This time, the Communist Party is very panicked from the central government to the school. I am ready to give them a fatal blow!"

    In this way, the Shanghai China Democratic League launched a "fatal blow" to the Communist Party!

    Moving Stones and Seizing the Marshal's Seal

    "Moving stones" and "seizing the marshal's seal" are two action slogans put forward by Chen Renbing and Lu Yi, the Rightist backbone of the Shanghai China Democratic League. These two sentences most essentially express their ambitions and run through their entire actions. In this attack by the China Democratic League Rightists against the Party, there are almost these two parts. The first part is to scold everything and describe the work of the unit as "pitch black" and worthless. Immediately afterwards, they sang loudly to "move the stones," "the leaders should step down," "serious diseases should be treated with strong medicine," and "discipline should be seriously enforced." The most blatant thing was "Shanghai Film Studio." After Chen Renbing and Wu Yin convened five seminars at Shanghai Film Studio, they sent the meeting records filled with "darkness" to the Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee, but they did not send them to the Party organization of Shanghai Film Studio. Chen Renbing said his mind: "Our cards are laid out, let's see what they do." He repeatedly called on the film industry to "remove the big stones," provoking that "some people should have stepped down long ago, but they haven't stepped down. The Party pats its own children very lightly, but it's not like this to others." Later, Yuan Wenshu, the manager of "Shanghai Film Studio," reviewed the shortcomings of the leadership work at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference and put forward improvement measures. The masses all welcomed it, but Chen Renbing was still not reconciled and immediately wrote an article "Be More Humble, More Humble" and sent it to Wenhui Daily, attacking Yuan Wenshu's review as a "Shaoxing master-style argument for examining the heart," cursing "officials protecting each other," and demanding that the Party "ruthlessly do the work of undermining the foundation." Behind his back, Chen Renbing told people that this time he would not remove the leaders of "Shanghai Film Studio" and he would never be reconciled. Why is the China Democratic League Rightist so enthusiastic about "moving stones"? Wu Yin, a Rightist who was appreciated by Luo Longji and Shen Zhiyuan, has recently revealed the truth. It turns out that she had long intended to "take the stage" to be the director and director of the Art Committee of "Shanghai Film Studio."

    Many materials revealed recently reveal that the China Democratic League Rightists have a series of specific plans to "seize the marshal's seal." Some want to be bureau chiefs, some want to be principals, and some want to be directors. Each has its own goal. For example, Chen Renbing, who spared no effort to attack the work of the Cultural Bureau as "a mess," his goal is "Deputy Director of the Shanghai Cultural Bureau." Lu Yi's goal is "President and Editor-in-Chief of the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily)." Chen Renbing also said to Shen Zhiyuan: "The China Democratic League wants to strive for a Shanghai Deputy Mayor." Naturally, this is only the "initial goal" of these ambitious figures. Their ultimate goal is to "the Communist Party step down." Just in May, they once seized a small dispute in the Shanghai Xuhui District Political Consultative Conference and launched a big storm to drive Wang Jun, the Secretary of the Xuhui District Committee of the Communist Party of China, "off the stage" to "make a model for the whole country."

    "Taking the stage" and "stepping down" are the center of the struggle.

    Try Every Means to Seize the Newspaper

    The China Democratic League Rightists pay special attention to seizing the tools of public opinion. Many grass-roots organizations of the China Democratic League in Shanghai asked the Party to "hand over the blackboard newspaper to us to run" when the Party began rectification. The blackboard newspaper in many units became a position for the China Democratic League Rightists to attack the Party.

    Competing for the leadership of the newspaper is an important front for the Shanghai China Democratic League Rightists. Wenhui Daily has long been occupied by Xu Zhucheng, the director of the Shanghai China Democratic League Propaganda Department. A fierce battle took place in Xinwen Ribao. Lu Yi, the deputy director of the Shanghai China Democratic League Propaganda Department, challenged the Party organization of Xinwen Ribao in early May when the Party began rectification, and proposed that "small meetings are not enjoyable, we need to hold big meetings." At the first day's meeting, Lu Yi was the first to stand up and made a long and inflammatory speech that had been prepared for a long time, saying that the main contradiction of Xinwen Ribao was the Party's "serious sectarianism." He also arranged a series of speeches to instigate the masses who did not know the truth with many distorted examples. The more the meeting went on, the more radical it became. In the end, it developed to the point of scolding activists with their noses pointed at them as "the most shameless" and "covered with the blood of the people." Wall posters also appeared with articles that named and insulted the Party's responsible cadres as "coffin faces" and so on. Lu Yi and others launched intense activities inside and outside the meeting, making the internal atmosphere of Xinwen Ribao smoky.

    The Shanghai China Democratic League Municipal Committee invested the greatest strength in the battle to seize the newspaper. Shen Zhiyuan, who had never contacted the grass-roots level in the past, personally led the China Democratic League branch of Xinwen Ribao and supported Lu Yi. A long speech by Lu Yi at the Xinwen Ribao meeting was published in full in the Shanghai China Democratic League's organ publication "Mengxun" (League News). Later, when Shen went to Beijing to attend a meeting, he entrusted this important task to Chen Renbing, Shen's confidant, to take over.

    The Shanghai China Democratic League's Rightist generals rose up one after another and externally coordinated the battle to seize the "marshal's seal" of Xinwen Ribao. Peng Wenyin echoed the attack on the newspaper at the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference, following Lu Yi's speech. The Rightist Xu Zhucheng introduced his so-called "demolishing the wall experience" of driving away Communist Party members, and asked Lu Yi to "promote" it in Xinwen Ribao. Peng Wenyin also asked Lu Yi to strive to do the "night shift" before seizing the "marshal's seal," because the night shift can finally decide the selection of manuscripts and control the layout. During this period, some manuscripts of the Rightists were indeed published in the newspaper through Lu Yi's hands.

    Where Will the Shanghai China Democratic League Go?

    The big fire ignited by the ambitious figures of the Shanghai China Democratic League was extinguished in less than a month. The outcome of the matter was completely contrary to their original intentions. After the people exposed their conspiracy, it was not the Communist Party that was isolated, but themselves. The vast number of upright League members also left them. The League members who had been blinded and instigated by them in the past and blindly followed the arson also woke up and angrily launched a struggle against them. Zhao Rongyuan and other four League members from Fudan University recently revealed Shen Zhiyuan's reactionary words and deeds in an open letter to Shen Zhiyuan, and painfully examined themselves for once having ideological confusion due to Shen Zhiyuan's malicious propaganda and becoming the "torches" of the Rightists. The letter concluded: "Tell you, we are determined to take the socialist road, and we will never allow any ambitious figures to drag the China Democratic League to a reactionary direction!" This is the voice of the vast number of League members of the Shanghai China Democratic League. More and more Shanghai people are joining the struggle against the Rightists, and they will never allow the Shanghai China Democratic League to abandon the cause of people's democracy and embark on the anti-socialist road.

    Chen Renbing and Lu Yi, the Rightist ambitious figures of the Shanghai China Democratic League, have recently made preliminary confessions, confessing their anti-socialist conspiracy, but their confessions, especially Chen Renbing's confession, are still very dishonest. Other Rightist backbones such as Peng Wenyin, Sun Siming, and Han Ming are still stubbornly resisting in various ways and have not confessed their crimes to the people. Shen Zhiyuan, who is the Chairman of the Shanghai China Democratic League Municipal Committee, has been ambiguous in his attitude in this anti-Rightist struggle and has been criticized by the masses. People hope that the rectification leadership group of the Shanghai China Democratic League will truly harden its back and launch a ruthless struggle against the Rightists!

    Where will the Shanghai China Democratic League go? This is a serious struggle between two lines, and it is time to make an immediate choice!

    上海民盟的背叛
    本报记者  季音  张竞
    本报在“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”的社论中曾指出：“民盟在百家争鸣过程和整风过程中所起的作用特别恶劣。有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线，都是自外于人民的，是反共反社会主义的。”
    上海民盟的情况就是这样。
    上海反右派斗争逐步深入展开以后，人们在大量揭露出来的右派分子反党活动的材料中，愈来愈明显地看到了一个重要的事实，即上海民盟的领导机关，是这次右派分子向党进攻中的一个主要的指挥部，一个右派分子的大本营，许多恶毒地向党射击的子弹，都是从这个角落里发射出来的。
    人们从上海民盟的领导成员中，发现上海民盟的领导集团，实际上已经成为一个右派集团，右派分子已掌握了上海民盟的领导大权。上海民盟的领导集团，现在已查明有半数以上是右派分子。但重要的还不在数量上，重要的是这一半人都是担负了实际领导工作的人，陈仁炳是领导机关又领导基层工作的副主任兼秘书长，彭文应是分工领导教育和妇女工作的副主任，右派分子孙斯鸣则是坐镇市委实际掌管民盟工作的副秘书长。他们形成了上海民盟市委的实际领导核心，在这次党的整风运动的大风浪中，把上海民盟的政治方向，转到了反党反社会主义的危险道路上。
    招兵买马早有准备
    已经查明，上海民盟这次对党的猖狂进攻，早在一年前就进行了积极的组织准备，其中主要的就是拼命扩充队伍，增强右派力量。一年前，党提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，民盟右派首领章伯钧在北京叫喊：“民盟大有可为，民主党派至少应该发展一、二百万人……”这个号召得到了被右派分子操纵的上海民盟的积极响应，从此他们就开始了不顾一切的“大发展”，他们竭力反对各民主党派在发展对象上的分工，提出“八仙过海，各显神通”的口号，迫不及待地督促各文艺团体中的民盟支部委员，要他们赶快拉盟员，“拉慢了就会被别的党派拉走了”。责难前文艺区分部发展组织太“保守”，到后来，陈仁炳等人索兴亲自出马，抛开基层组织，深入到各部门进行“个人联系”。
    上海民盟隐藏在这个“大发展”背后的政治野心，在他们无所不用其极的各种卑鄙活动中，完全暴露了出来。他们在这次“大发展”中有两个“重点”，或者说是两个主要目标，第一个目标就是“向名牌进攻”（用他们的术语叫做“抓名牌”），陈仁炳常常说：“××单位只要那几个知名人士争取过来，局面就是我们的了。”为了抓名牌，可以不惜一切工本，千方百计地用登门拜访、请客吃饭、汽车接送等卑劣的手段，甚至答允可以不宣誓、不写自传、不参加任何会议为条件。上海名歌唱家董爱琳，曾被他们确定为发展对象，陈仁炳先通过别人的关系一再邀请她参加座谈会，请她吃饭，几次都被董爱琳拒绝了，最后董被逼得没法，勉强答应了他的一次邀请，他便在席间大吹其对音乐的爱好，接着又向董爱琳炫耀沪剧方面我们有丁是娥，越剧方面有戚雅仙，京剧方面有……，就是音乐界盟员较少，特别是歌唱方面更少，所以希望你们名歌唱家也能来参加……”这席话引起了董爱琳强烈的反感，当时就拒绝参加民盟，可是陈仁炳没有死心，一星期后，又跑到董爱琳家里动员她入盟，当董爱琳一口回绝后，陈仁炳还死皮赖脸地说：“希望这不是最后的决定，还请你再考虑。”对京剧演员言慧珠、童芷苓等陈仁炳也用尽了阿谀奉承的本领。为了争取名画家刘海粟入盟，他们甚至在刘未入盟前，就把他列入市委委员，大概是作为入盟的一个交换条件吧。
    上海民盟“大发展”的第二个重点是“向落后开门”。他们到处物色那些对党有不满情绪的人，有意识地找他们开座谈会，美其名为代表知识分子“利益”，实际上是从中物色发展对象，作为向党进攻的资本。在去年12月，由陈仁炳一手主持的“上影”五次座谈会上，就有这么两件事情：陈仁炳看到舒绣文几年来没有拍什么戏，估计她对上影厂领导一定会有意见，便有意邀请她参加座谈会，趁机争取她入盟。不料，舒绣文非但没有在座谈会上发牢骚，却为上影厂说了几句公道话，认为上影厂七年来的成绩不能否定。这使陈仁炳大失所望，以后就再也不理舒绣文了。并告人说：“发展舒绣文，盟要脱离群众的”。在那五次座谈会上，另一演员房珊，因对评级不满，与领导上的情绪很对立，并说共产党没有民主，只有民盟才有温暖，表示想参加民盟，陈仁炳一听大为得意，马上就批准她入盟。盟内有人反对他这种做法，但他却说：“吸收这样的人进来，对我们非常有利。”就在这五次座谈会前后，上影的盟员一下就由七人发展到三十三人。有人把这种突击式的发展组织称之为“火线入盟”。即是说，这些人是在与共产党的作战中经过了“考验”的。是可靠的“同志”。
    上海民盟除了大规模的发展外，右派分子同时还注意在各个部门培养盟的骨干，布设据点，像“上影”的吴茵，“人艺”的章曼萍，都是为右派分子重用的心腹。他们在这次放火中都起了据点的作用。
    通过这种种办法，上海民盟组织在短短一年内，竟由九百人扩大到三千四百几十人，增长了三倍多。这中间，当然有很多是抱了正当的愿望而入盟的好人，但是在不少的基层单位中，民盟小组或支部变成了落后分子、失意分子的小集团，他们的组织生活，就是发牢骚，骂领导，甚至进行反党的活动。所谓思想改造的任务，早已被抛到了九霄云外。更可疑的是上海民盟还把一些反革命分子和一些历史不明的人也吸收入盟，在上海司法部门中有两个定了案的历史反革命分子被发展为盟员。而这无疑正是上海民盟市委右派野心家所预期的目的。
    誓师大会杀气腾腾
    今年5月，中共中央发出了开展整风运动的指示，并提出要各民主党派帮助党整风的号召，心怀叵测的上海民盟右派分子满以为天下大变了，可以趁机向党大举进攻了，于是就在5月14日召开了一个全市民盟干部大会，策动全市各单位民盟组织向党开火。会议由右派分子彭文应主持，他一走上讲台，就说：“今天是誓师的大会，是民主进军的大会……”向谁誓师？向谁进军？不用说，目标当然是各级党的领导了。道貌岸然一向以“学者”自居的沈志远，在这次大会上，竟完全换了一付杀气腾腾的面孔，他以从来没有过的“慷慨激昂”、“义愤填膺”的姿态，做了一个长篇的煽动性的报告，报告中几乎用尽一切恶毒的言词，对共产党进行了极其露骨的污蔑和中伤。他污蔑人事部门是“鬼鬼祟祟，关起门来，包办政治工作……”他把某些单位党与非党之间的隔阂，夸大成“钢骨水泥的很厚的墙，”或者是“不可跨越的”“相互不能沟通”的深沟。他恶毒地在“教条主义长期统治”的大帽子下，说“我们的学术思想、自由思想几乎达到窒息而死的命运，因此解放八年来我们的学术界显得非常的沉寂。没有任何独立思考，听不见有什么自由辩论的空气。也就是说我们的学术界是没有生命，没有生气的。”他又笼统地不加分析地把党外人士有职无权的现象夸大起来，然后又别有用心地喊出一连串煽惑人心的口号：“我们要说话，我们要批评这些人，我们要反对这些人！”“我们一定要求有一分职，就要有一分适合于这个职位的权，同时要求有适合于这个职权的信任！”“任何人也没有权利来侵犯我们应当有的责任，我们应当有的权利！”不仅如此，他在报告里一再强调要“对社会主义制度下的每一个部门、每一个单位……等等的思想、作风、措施、制度进行全面的大检查。”要大家“用批判的精神来对待以前的制度、方针、政策，不要怕片面，提出来再说。”他还非常肯定地说：“那些过了时的、不合理的、不符合当前形势要求的制度”必须“坚决的，彻底的加以消除。”最后，他还唯恐大家没有勇气出“师”“进军”，一再拍胸脯保证给大家撑腰、支持。经过沈志远这一番“鼓动”，在四百个盟员干部的心里烧起了熊熊的烈火，本来对党有些意见的，被他挑得激愤起来了，原来靠拢党的也在心里蒙上了一层疑虑。当他们拿起沈志远所传授的“火把”回到各单位之后，一团反党反社会主义的黑云就在上海的天空翻滚起来了。全面发动，五路进攻
    就在这次誓师大会之后，上海民盟的各级组织向党发起了全面的进攻。其中有五个方面是他们进攻的重点，即戏剧音乐界、电影界、高等教学、司法、新闻，这几方面都由民盟的主要人员直接负责。陈仁炳、彭文应在文艺部门最先打响了，他们在上海电影制片厂、人民艺术剧院、京剧院、国画院、曲艺界、评弹界四处纵起“火”来。“上影”和“人艺”的火烧得最早也最猛，“人艺”的右派分子张立德、章曼萍等人逼着要领导承认“宗派主义”，鼓动演员们散伙另组剧团，拒绝领导上着手改进工作。右派分子骂国画院是“一言难尽，一塌糊涂，一团糟”，提出不要国画院；评弹界和曲艺界也掀起了闹工资福利的风潮……许杰、戴家祥和孙大雨，在高等学校里也分别行动起来了。民盟华东师大支部负责人许杰召开了中文系民盟小组会议，会上他们辱骂中文系的党总支书记是“监工”，提出要“中文系的党退出去”，“学校里撤销党委会”，“民盟要与党委享同样地位。”并且领导他所在的中文系三年级学生组织了什么“整风筹委会”，美其名要“帮助党整风”，但却不许党总支的同志参加。他们画漫画，出大字报，骂党员是“特务”，是“阎罗王”，甚至提出要由非党人员来召开“整风会议”，领导党的整风。
    同校历史系的民盟盟员戴家祥，化名“楚歌”，贴出了一封“告全体同学书”，说“三大主义是一母所生的难兄难弟，这个母体是共产党人的专制集权，因此造成人民没有自由，没有民主，人与人之间不平等，人身生存没有保障，……”他号召同学们“起来”，“反对共产党人的专制集权”。
    另一角里，司法工作方面的枪声也打响了，民盟上海市委在5月18日召开了一次三十多人参加的司法工作座谈会，别有用心地对司法工作展开了疯狂的污蔑，攻击，造谣说上海第一中级人民法院处理社会镇反案件有34％错判了，说什么“现在的审判员都可以随便立法，要怎样判就怎样判”，“现在还有草菅人命的昏官”，他们同时又把攻击矛头对着工农出身的司法工作者，讽刺他们“没有文化”，“连判决书也不会写，”挑拨司法部门中党和知识分子的关系，说什么党对司法部门的知识分子是“利用、限制、改造”的政策。……民盟右派分子对这次攻击异常满意，对发表污蔑言论的李国机、刘和平大加赞赏，请李国机签名留念，请他们吃饭，并且对刘说：“如果谁要你检讨，你就写稿到（民盟）市委组织部。”
    新闻战线上，沈志远、陈仁炳、彭文应、陆诒都投入了战斗。
    上海民盟右派分子就这样在四处掀风作浪，发出了一切最难听、最恶毒的咒骂声，不准别人出来说一句公道话，讲一点工作的成绩，5月的上海，被上海民盟右派分子烧起的这把漫天野火，烧得到处黑烟滚滚，天地为之变色。被反共狂热冲昏了头脑的民盟右派人物，错误地估计了形势。民盟右派分子戴家祥生动地道出了他们当时的心情。一天，他兴冲冲地跑到学生宿舍对一群学生说：“你们这里有党员吗？这次整风，共产党从中央到学校都很恐慌，我准备给以致命的打击！”
    上海的民盟正是这样地向共产党发起了一个“致命的打击！”
    搬石头与夺帅印
    “搬石头”，“夺帅印”，这是上海民盟右派骨干陈仁炳、陆诒提出的两句行动口号，这两句话最本质地道出了他们的野心，也贯穿在他们的整个行动中。这次民盟右派分子对党的进攻中，几乎都有这么两部曲，第一曲是骂倒一切，把所在单位的工作形容为“漆黑一团”，一无是处，紧接着就高唱要“搬石头”，领导人要“下台”，“重病要用重药医”，要“认真执行纪律”等。进行得最露骨的是“上影”，陈仁炳和吴茵在上影召开了五次座谈会之后，把记满了“黑暗”的会议记录分送给中央和上海市委，但就是不送给上影的党组织，陈仁炳说出了他的心意：“我们的底牌摊出来了，看他们怎么办。”他一再呼吁电影界“要搬开大石头”，挑拨说“有些人早应下台，就是没有下台，党对自己的儿女拍得很轻，对别人就不是这样。”以后，“上影”经理袁文殊在上海市委宣传工作会议上，检讨了领导工作的缺点，并提出了改进的办法，群众都表示欢迎，但陈仁炳仍不甘心，立即写了一篇“虚心些，再虚心些”的文章送到文汇报，攻击袁文殊的检讨是“绍兴师爷式的诛心之论”，咒骂“官官相护”，要求党“无情地做挖墙脚的工作”。背地里，陈仁炳对人说，这次他不搬掉“上影”的领导人，决不甘心。为什么民盟右派如此热心于“搬石头”？受到罗隆基和沈志远赏识的右派分子吴茵最近已说出真相，原来她早就蓄意想“上台”做“上影”的厂长和艺委会的主任。
    最近揭发出来的许多材料，透露出民盟右派是有一系列“夺帅印”的具体计划的，他们有的要做局长，有的要做校长，有的要做主任，各有各的目标，例如不遗余力攻击文化局工作“一团糟”的陈仁炳，他的目标是“上海文化局副局长”；陆诒的目标是“新闻日报社社长和总编辑”，陈仁炳还对沈志远说：“民盟要争取一个上海市副市长。”自然，这还只是这些野心分子的“初步目标”而已，他们最终是要“共产党下台”的。就在5月间，他们曾经抓住上海徐汇区政协的一次小纠纷，掀起了一场大风波，要把中共徐汇区党委书记王钧赶“下台”，“给全国做出一个典型。”
    “上台”与“下台”，这就是斗争的中心。千方百计夺取报纸
    民盟右派分子异常注意夺取舆论的工具。上海不少民盟基层组织，在党开始整风时，即要党“把黑板报交出来给我们办。”许多单位的黑板报成了民盟右派攻击党的一个阵地。
    争夺报纸的领导权，更是上海民盟右派的一条重要战线。文汇报是老早就被上海民盟宣传部主任徐铸成等人占领了。激烈的战斗发生在新闻日报。上海民盟宣传部副主任陆诒在5月初党开始整风时，就对新闻日报党组织挑战，提出“小会不过瘾，要搞大会。”第一天的大会上，陆诒第一个起立作了准备已久的长篇煽动性发言，说新闻日报的主要矛盾是党的“严重的宗派主义”。他还布置了一系列的发言，用许多歪曲事实的例子煽动不明真相的群众，大会越开越偏激，最后发展到点着鼻子骂积极分子是“无耻之尤”，“浑身涂满了人民的鲜血。”墙报上也出现了指名辱骂党的负责干部是“棺材脸孔”等等的文章。陆诒等人在会内会外展开了紧张的活动，新闻日报内部，弄得一片乌烟瘴气。
    上海民盟市委用最大的力量投入了争夺报纸的战斗，过去从不联系基层的沈志远，当时竟亲自出马直接领导新闻日报的民盟支部，为陆诒撑腰。陆诒在新闻日报大会上的一个长篇发言，被全文刊载在上海民盟的机关刊物“盟讯”上。以后，沈去北京开会，就把这个重任托付给沈的亲信陈仁炳来接管。
    上海民盟的右派大将们纷纷起来，从外部策应争夺新闻日报“帅印”的战斗。彭文应在市委宣传会议上，紧接陆诒的发言之后，也呼应地攻击报纸。右派分子徐铸成介绍了他赶走共产党员的所谓“拆墙经验”，要陆诒在新闻日报“推广”。彭文应并要陆诒在未夺得“帅印”之前，先争取做“夜班”，因为夜班可以最后决定稿件的取舍，控制版面。在这期间，确实有一些右派分子的稿件，经过陆诒的手登到报上去了。
    上海民盟何去何从
    上海民盟野心分子烧起的这把大火，延烧了不到一个月之后就被扑灭了。事情的结局与他们的初衷完全相反。当人民揭穿了他们的阴谋之后，被孤立的不是共产党，而是他们自己。广大正直的盟员也都离开了他们。过去受到他们蒙蔽、煽惑而盲目跟着放火的盟员，也清醒过来，愤怒地向他们展开了斗争。复旦大学盟员赵荣远等四人最近在给沈志远的一封公开信中，揭发了沈志远的反动言行，沉痛地检查自己由于沈志远的恶毒宣传，思想上一度发生混乱，做了右派分子的“火把”。这一封信的最后说：“告诉你，我们是坚决要走社会主义的道路的，我们绝不允许任何野心家把民盟拖到反动方向！”这是上海民盟广大盟员的呼声。愈来愈多的上海人民正在投入反右派分子的斗争，他们也决不允许上海民盟背弃人民民主事业，走上反社会主义道路。
    上海民盟右派野心家陈仁炳、陆诒等人最近都已作了初步交代，供认了反社会主义的阴谋，但他们的交代尤其是陈仁炳的交代还很不老实。其他如彭文应、孙斯鸣、韩鸣等右派骨干，还在用各种方式顽抗，没有向人民供出他们的罪行。身为民盟上海市委主任委员的沈志远在这次反右派斗争中态度暧昧，已经受到群众的指责。人们希望上海民盟的整风领导小组真正硬起腰干来，与右派分子无情地展开斗争！
    上海民盟将何去何从，这是一场严重的两条路线的斗争，是到了须要立即作出抉择的时候了！
