More Than Forty Secret Letters
By Our Correspondent Xiao Yan

Editor's Note: The reactionary clique of rightist Zhang Yousong has been completely dragged into the light of day under the exposure and criticism of teachers and students of Shandong Normal College. This is a reactionary group with extreme hatred for socialism, organized, with a program, discipline, and funding. The "commander" Zhang Yousong wrote more than forty secret letters to his followers in thirty-eight days. From these secret letters, everyone can see how this small group of rightists hated socialism, how they arranged their attacks, how they dealt with the people's counterattacks, and how they directed retreats in order to prepare for a "protracted war."

In the anti-rightist struggle, teachers and students of Shandong Normal College recently exposed an organized, programmatic, disciplined, and funded reactionary group. The currently revealed materials have shown that Zhang Yousong, who hangs the shingle of a translator in Beijing, is the direct commander of this reactionary group. This Zhang Yousong has translated some literary works by European and American writers. Recently, he took advantage of the rectification movement to launch a frantic attack on the Party. He successively published "I Raise My Head, Straighten My Chest, and Throw Myself into Battle!" and "Diary of Being Silenced" in Wenyi Bao, viciously attacking the leadership of the Party. Several main members of this group are teachers at Shandong Normal College: Zhuang Weishi, Li Jinsheng, and Dai Tianqing.

This reactionary group set fires everywhere in Shandong Normal College. After their words and deeds attacking the Party were exposed, they handed over some of the secret letters written by their leader, Zhang Yousong. In the thirty-eight days from May 22 to June 28, Zhang Yousong sent more than forty letters in succession, sometimes even sending three letters in one day. These secret letters were all numbered.

One "Commander," Three Lackeys, Two "Battlefields"

In this reactionary group, Zhang Yousong appointed himself "commander." In a letter dated May 26, Zhang Yousong wrote clearly: "I am commanding a team that has grown from nothing, and have opened up two battlefields one after another." The so-called two battlefields are one where Zhang Yousong used "Wenyi Bao" (with the support of Xiao Qian, the deputy editor of the newspaper) to viciously attack the People's Literature Publishing House and the Party's leadership, and the other battlefield is Shandong Normal College. Zhang Yousong wrote in a letter dated May 29: "I am full of energy here and can cooperate with you remotely in combat!" In a letter dated June 16, he wrote: "We are comrades-in-arms connected by flesh and blood, sharing life and death!"

Dai Tianqing was the "secretary" in charge of incoming and outgoing letters and propaganda materials. Li Jinsheng was the arsonist who came forward. Zhuang Weishi (who had the deepest relationship with Zhang Yousong) mostly planned behind the scenes. They held secret meetings at night, all at Zhuang Weishi's home.

This small group desperately tried to win over the masses and expand its ranks. Some students were even dragged into distributing propaganda for them. In a letter dated May 26, Zhang Yousong wrote: "We will organize thousands upon thousands of pure, kind, sympathetic, and righteous friends in this battle." They also used open letters to win over faculty and staff, calling themselves doing "united front work."

This reactionary group printed seven kinds of propaganda materials in Beijing (including Zhang Yousong's "Our War Song" and articles attacking the Shandong Normal College Party Committee, etc.), printing 100 to 300 copies of each, and distributing them to Shandong Normal College and all parts of the country.

This reactionary group, through Li Jinsheng (an old hand at intelligence gathering who served as a translator for a Frenchman named Harno in 1948, collecting our military and political intelligence in Beijing) and Zhuang Weishi, Dai Tianqing, etc., collected the names of relevant provincial and municipal leading organs stationed in Jinan, the names of leaders, the administrative organization of the Normal College, and the rectification situation of various organs, and reported them to Zhang Yousong. Even large-character posters of several thousand words posted by others were copied and given to Zhang Yousong.

This group had activity funds. Zhang Yousong wrote in a letter dated May 29: "Enclosed is 70 yuan for war expenses. Please use it sparingly, and I will provide more assistance later."

This reactionary group had discipline. When Zhang Yousong's orders were not well implemented, he became furious and wrote: "This commander enforces the law like a mountain, and those who disobey orders will be executed!!!" "If the opportunity for military action is delayed again (referring to delaying the distribution of propaganda materials - reporter), military law will be applied!!!"

Zhang believed that the great blooming and contending was "the stage of the Huaihai Campaign," and that once his "war song" was sent out, "it would be equivalent to the Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River."

From May 23, Zhang Yousong began to arrogantly sing a "war song." He wrote in a letter: "Comrades, comrades-in-arms, we must continue to fight with full confidence! Our team will grow stronger in battle, while the enemy's team will inevitably scatter like birds and beasts!"

In the third letter written on May 25, Zhang Yousong revealed his vicious intentions: "The three evils are our mortal enemies. If we are burned by fire, it will be 'Wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again.' We must continue our efforts with full confidence and deal with it to the end! If we are fire, it will be 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' No matter how rampant the enemy is, we must not lose confidence!" The "three evils" referred to by this reactionary group here are different from the subjectivism, dogmatism, and sectarianism that we want to oppose. They regard the existence of the Communist Party as the "three evils." Therefore, Zhang Yousong blatantly wrote: "If the battle situation is smooth, we will go straight to Huanglong and destroy the lair of the 'three evils'; if there is a temporary disparity between the enemy and us, we must have the determination to swear to coexist with the position of justice!" When Zhang Yousong saw that various rightists were clamoring and the people had not yet counterattacked, he wrote triumphantly in a letter dated May 26: "Those non-righteous people of all kinds have become 'fish in a cauldron'! Before the water is heated, these fish are still swimming as happily as if they were in the river! Who is burning the fire? Isn't it us 'stubborn' guys?" Unfortunately, these words are truly an unadulterated portrayal of this reactionary group today.

These murderous roars can certainly explain the problem very well. Now, let the readers see their arrogance. A leaflet printed and distributed by Zhang Yousong was entitled "Our War Song"; the subtitle was: "Written for launching a sacred struggle to eliminate the three evils of Shandong Normal College." The back was inscribed with thirty-two large characters: "Righteous indignation fills the chest, anger soars to the sky! Uphold justice, protect human rights!! Respond to the call, participate in rectification!!! Regardless of everything, move forward bravely!!!" In this leaflet written in the form of a poem, although there are not many words, it is filled with poisonous arrows for charging into battle: What: "Dark and sunless," "Party Committee Lords," "Confused bureaucrats lose their minds," "Blind masses support absurd courts," "Raise your head, straighten your chest, and throw yourself into battle!" "We have lit the torches of truth and justice and burst out angry sparks at the 'incarnation of the three evils'!" "We want to make angry accusations, beat loud war drums, and want the sparks to ignite a raging fire and rush to the sky!"

The letter on May 31 said: "I think it has now reached the 'Huaihai Campaign' stage, and as soon as I print and send out the second batch of documents (referring to the propaganda "Our War Song" - reporter's note), it will be equivalent to the Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River."

At this time, Zhang Yousong published the article "I Raise My Head, Straighten My Chest, and Throw Myself into Battle" in Wenyi Bao, and repeatedly boasted in letters to Li Jinsheng and others about his "victory" on this battlefield, asking Li Jinsheng and others to appreciate the poisonous weeds he released in Wenyi Bao, saying that carefully reading that article "will help to clarify ideological awareness."

After the anti-rightist struggle was launched, Zhang's secret letter said: "It is not a good warrior to be unable to fight when the enemy and our forces are very different! I order you to be strong!"

However, seeing that the people across the country launched a fierce counterattack against the rightists, some people in this reactionary group panicked. So the "commander" Zhang Yousong constantly cheered up his subordinates. On June 5, he said in a letter: "It is not a good warrior to be unable to fight when the enemy and our forces are very different! I advise - I simply order - you to be strong!" He also wrote: "We must not be timid because the newspapers have recently denounced Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, Zhang Naiqi, etc. Because we have nothing in common with those who hold reactionary remarks. The other party may slander us, but we must not be afraid!"

On June 12, Zhang Yousong mentioned in a letter: "Judging from the newspapers these days, the central government's attitude towards rectification has obviously changed greatly... The future of the country cannot but make people worried!..." "In this case, can we give up? I say no, we must be determined to fight a protracted war, be calm, have the confidence that truth will prevail, and never be timid in the face of the rising flames of rectification..." Zhang Yousong instructed again on the 13th: "Be careful and bold, be calm, and be brave. Too many concerns can easily ruin things. Remember, remember."

On June 16, perhaps Zhang Yousong's most tense day? On this day, he sent three letters to their small group in succession. In the first letter, he praised Li Jinsheng's so-called "Punitive Declaration Against Song" (Song refers to Comrade Song Ting, a member of the Shandong Normal College Party Committee - reporter) for being wonderful, believing that their reprinting and distribution of these documents "will have the power of thunder and can form an overwhelming force!" When he discovered from a letter that Dai Tianqing was still very panicked, he immediately rebuked him in the second letter of the day: "Your weakness, incompetence, and inability to distinguish the true situation are giving me a headache!" He told Dai to make a final struggle, "The more the other party counterattacks, the more it shows that they have reached the stage of dying struggle." "You should raise your head and straighten your chest!" "Even if I and Comrades Zhuang and Li die, leaving only you, do not surrender, calmly respond to the battle, and fight to the end."

The conspiracy of the small group was exposed, and three letters were sent in one day, continuously arranging "retreats" and preparing his subordinates for a "protracted war."

Zhang Yousong said in the letter: He can understand even Dai Tianqing's feeling of being angry enough to want to kill! He encouraged Dai to "be bold in his external activities and don't be afraid of showing his face!!!" The third letter was written at midnight that day. Probably a few hours after the previous letter was sent, Zhang Yousong felt that the situation was not good and was worried that his small group would be exposed. Therefore, he wrote another letter in the middle of the night, warning his subordinates, "Don't act rashly, prepare for a protracted war." Zhang Yousong even scolded Zhuang Weishi's nanny as a traitor (she told outsiders that Dai Tianqing had been hiding in Zhuang Weishi's house since he returned from Beijing, because Dai was afraid of showing his face, and even urinated at home during the day, asking her to pour the potty.) and said: "We must also give Li Jinsheng's nanny a preventive shot in advance, and everything must be proactive and always vigilant!"

In the last few letters, Zhang Yousong continuously arranged retreats, preparing his subordinates for a "protracted war." The letter on June 21 instructed Li Jinsheng to only admit to ideological ambiguity at the Democratic League rectification symposium, and to argue that their proposed "family world" had "no resonance" with Chu Anping's "party world." The letter on the 25th gave more specific instructions on how to make a false self-criticism: "In the first stage of our participation in this rectification, we were too aggressive and violated the spirit of 'gentle breeze and fine rain' and 'being kind to others,' so that the objective effect was far from the subjective desire..." "If you are criticized by others and you doubt that you have really committed a right-leaning mistake, I think that is too vulnerable to scrutiny!" "The mistake is only an ideological problem, and it must have nothing to do with the right-leaning group..." "Our ideas are not completely consistent... This statement to the students is beneficial to our struggle!"

This small group of anti-communist and anti-socialist rightists vainly attempt to retract their demonic hands attacking the Party and pretend to be good people, but that is impossible. Zhang Yousong's retreat arrangement is even more futile! Among the more than 3,000 teachers and students of Shandong Normal College, their ferocious faces have been exposed. This reactionary small group has begun to disintegrate. Li Jinsheng admitted his reactionary words and deeds that set fires in the Normal College, and admitted that the so-called divorce case was a cover for attacking the Party. A small number of students who had been deceived and won over also rose up to expose the criminal activities of this small group. All teachers and students of Shandong Normal College also solemnly warned Zhang Yousong, a rightist in Beijing, to thoroughly confess his crimes of engaging in anti-communist and anti-socialist activities!

    四十多封密信
    本报记者　萧彦
    编者按：右派分子张友松的反动集团，在山东师范学院师生们的揭发和批判下，已经完全被拉到光天化日之下来了。这是一个极端仇恨社会主义的有组织、有纲领、有纪律、有经费的反动集团。“主将”张友松在三十八天当中给他的喽啰写了四十几封密信，从这些密信里，大家可以看出这一小撮右派分子如何仇恨社会主义，如何布置进攻，如何对待人民的反击，如何指挥退却，以便准备进行“持久战”。
    山东师范学院师生在反右派斗争中，最近揭露出了一个有组织、有纲领、有纪律、有经费的反动集团。目前已揭发的材料已经表明，在北京的挂着翻译家招牌的张友松是这个反动集团的直接指挥者。这个张友松翻译过一些欧美作家的文学作品，最近乘整风的机会，向党进行了疯狂的进攻。他在文艺报连续发表了“我昂起头、挺起胸来，投入战斗！”和“封嘴记”，恶毒地攻击党的领导。这个集团的几个主要成员都是山东师范学院的教师——庄维石、李金声和戴天庆。
    这个反动集团在山东师范学院到处放火。向党进攻的言行被揭穿后，他们交出了他们的首领——张友松写的一部分密信。从5月22日到6月28日的三十八天中间，张友松接连寄出四十多封信，有一天竟然连寄三封。这些密信都编了号码。
    一个“主将”三个喽啰两个“战场”
    在这个反动集团里，张友松自任“主将”。5月26日张友松的信上写得明白：“我指挥着由无到有的队伍，先后开辟了两个战场。”所谓两个战场，一个是张友松利用“文艺报”（得到了该报副主编萧乾的支持）向人民文学出版社和党的领导恶毒进攻的“战场”，另一个战场就是山东师范学院。张友松5月29日的信中说：“我在此精神抖擞，尽可以与你们遥相呼应地配合作战！”6月16日的信中又写道：“我们是血肉相连、生死与共的战友啊！”
    戴天庆是专管来往信件和宣传品的“秘书”，李金声是出头露面的放火人，庄维石（他和张友松的关系最深）多在幕后策划。他们夜晚开秘密会，都是在庄维石家里。
    这个小集团拚命拉拢群众，扩大队伍。有些学生居然被拉去给他们散发宣传品。5月26日张友松的信中写道：“我们将在这场战斗中，组织千千万万的纯洁、善良、富有同情和正义感的朋友”。他们还用公开信的方式，向教职员进行拉拢，自称是做“统战工作”。
    这个反动集团在北京先后印刷了七种宣传品（其中有张友松的“我们的战歌”以及攻击山东师范学院党委等的文章），每种印一百份至三百份，散发到山东师范学院及全国各地。
    这个反动集团通过李金声（他是个搞情报的老手，曾于1948年给住在北京搜集我军、政情报的法国人哈尔诺当过翻译）和庄维石、戴天庆等搜集驻济南市的省、市有关领导机关名称、领导人姓名、师范学院行政组织，和各机关整风的情况，汇报给张友松，连别人贴出的几千字的大字报，都抄给了张友松。
    这个集团有活动经费。张友松5月29日来信说：“兹寄上战费七十元，请节省着用，以后再行接济。”
    这个反动集团有纪律。当张友松的命令没能很好贯彻时，他便大发雷霆，写道：“本帅执法如山，抗命者斩！！！”“倘再误戎机（指的延误了散发宣传品——记者）定以军法从事！！！”
    张认为大鸣大放是“到了淮海战役阶段”，他的“战歌”一发出去，“就等于解放大军渡江了”。
    从5月23日起，张友松就狂妄地唱起“战歌”来了。他在信中写道：“同志们，战友们，我们必须信心百倍地继续战斗！我们的队伍要在战斗中壮大起来的，而敌人的队伍却必然有鸟兽散的一天！”
    在5月25日写的第三封信里，道出了张友松狠毒的心肠：“三害是我们的死敌，如果说是火，我们被火烧，那就是‘野火烧不尽，春风吹又生’，我们要信心百倍地再接再厉，与它周旋到底！如果说我们是火，那就是‘星星之火，可以燎原’，无论敌人怎么猖狂，我们也不要失去信心！”这个反动集团在这里所说的“三害”，和我们要反对的主观主义、教条主义、宗派主义不同，他们是把共产党的存在看作“三害”。因此，张友松露骨地写道：“战局顺利，我们就要直捣黄龙，摧毁‘三害’的巢穴；万一暂时有敌我悬殊之势，我们就要拿出决心来，誓为正义的阵地共存亡！”张友松在看到各种右派分子大肆叫嚣，人民尚未加以反击的时候，5月26日的信中又得意忘形地写道：“那些形形色色的非正义的人们已经成了‘釜底游鱼’！在水还没有烧热的时候，这些鱼还是像在河里似的，游得多么得意呀！谁在烧火呢，不正是我们这些‘执迷不误’的家伙吗？”可惜的是，这些话倒真正是这个反动集团今天的不折不扣的写照。
    这些杀气腾腾的叫嚣，固然已经很能说明问题了，现在再请读者看看他们的气焰吧。张友松印刷散发的一份传单，正题叫“我们的战歌”；副题叫：“为发动铲除山东师范学院的三害的神圣斗争而作。”背面描上了三十二个大字：“义愤填膺，怒火冲天！维护正义，保障人权！！响应号召，参加整风！！！不顾一切，勇往直前！！！”在这份以诗的形式写的传单里，字数虽不多，却塞满了冲锋陷阵的毒箭：什么：“暗无天日”、“党委老爷”、“昏庸的官僚主义者丧失了理智”、“盲从的群众支持着荒谬的法庭”、“昂起头，挺起胸来，投入战斗！”、“我们点起了真理和正义的火把，向‘三害的化身’迸出愤怒的火花！”、“我们要提出愤怒的控诉，捶起响亮的战鼓，要叫星星之火，燃起熊熊的烈焰，冲向云霄！”
    5月31日的信上又说：“我认为现在已经到了‘淮海战役’阶段，只等我把第二批文件（即指宣传品“我们的战歌”——记者注）印就一发出去，就等于解放大军渡江了。”
    就在这个时候，张友松在文艺报上发表了“我昂起头、挺起胸来，投入战斗”的文章，并在给李金声等的信中数次吹嘘他在这个战场上的“胜利”，要求李金声等好好欣赏他在文艺报上放出的毒草。说细读了那篇文章“有助于思想意识的明确”。
    在反右派斗争开展以后，张的密信说：“敌我势力悬殊之下，就不能作战的，决不是好战士！我命令你们坚强起来！”
    但是，在看到全国人民对右派分子的进攻展开了猛烈的反击，这个反动集团里有些人便慌张起来。于是“主将”张友松就不断地给他的部下打气。6月5日他在信中说：“敌我势力悬殊之下，就不能作战的，决不是好战士！我奉劝——简直说是命令——你们坚强起来！”又写道：“近日报纸声讨葛佩琦、储安平、章乃器等，我们都不可因此而畏怯。因为我们与那些持反动言论的人，是毫无共同之处的。对方可能诋毁我们，但我们不要怕！”
    6月12日张友松在信中又提到：“从这几天的报纸看来，中央对整风的态度显然是大为改变了……今后国事，不免令人忧心忡忡（原信错写为：“忧心种种”）！……”、“在这种情况下，我们能罢休吗？我说不能，必须抱定决心作持久战，要沉着，要有真理必胜信心，万不可在整风高涨气焰面前胆怯……”。张友松13日再指示：“要细心大胆，要沉着，更要勇敢，顾虑太多，极易坏事，切记切记。”
    6月16日，也许是张友松最紧张的一天了吧？这一天，他向他们的小集团接连发出了三封信。头一封信，夸奖李金声的所谓“讨宋檄文”（宋指的是中共山东师范学院党委委员宋汀同志——记者）写得妙，认为他们重印散发了这些文件“就能有雷霆万钧之力，可以形成排山倒海之势了！”当他从来信发现了戴天庆还很慌张时，马上在当天的第二封信中指斥道：“你的懦弱无能和不善分辨真实形势，却使我大伤脑筋！”他叫戴作最后挣扎，“对方愈是反扑，愈是表示他们到了临终的挣扎阶段”。“应该昂起头，挺起胸来！”“即令我和庄、李等同志都死去了，只剩你一个人，也不要屈服，沉着应战，斗争到底。”
    小集团阴谋败露，一天连寄三信，连续布置“退却”，要他的部下作“持久战”的准备。
    张友松在信里说：连戴天庆气愤得想杀人的心情，他都能体会！他鼓动戴“大着胆子在外活动，千万不要怕露面！！！”第三封信是在当天的午夜写的。大概是在前信发出了几个钟头之后，张友松又感到形势不妙，耽心他的小集团会暴露出来，于是，他在深夜中又写了一封信，警告他的部下，“不要轻举妄动，作持久战的准备了”。张友松连庄维石的保姆也骂作奸细（她对外人讲出了戴天庆从北京回来就躲在庄维石家中的事，因为戴怕露面，白天小便也在家里，让她给倒便盆。）并说：“对李金声的保姆，也要预先打打防疫针，一切都要主动，要随时警惕！”
    在最后的几封信里，张友松连续布置退却，要他的部下做“持久战”的准备。6月21日的信指示李金声在民盟整风座谈会上，只承认是思想上的模糊，申辩他们提出的“家天下”与储安平说的“党天下”“毫无共鸣”。25日的信中对如何作假检讨更指示得具体了：“我们在这次参加整风的第一阶段中，火气太大，违犯‘和风细雨’和‘与人为善’精神，以致客观效果和主观愿望相差很远……”。“如果受了别人批评，居然怀疑自己是真的犯了右倾的毛病，我看那未免太经不起考验了！”“错误只是思想问题，与右倾集团，想必没有什么关系……”。“我们思想上不完全一致……向学生这一声明，对我们的斗争是有利的！”
    这一小撮反共反社会主义的右派分子，妄想把向党进攻的魔手缩回去装好人，那是办不到的。张友松的退却布置更是徒劳！在山东师范学院三千多师生中，他们的凶恶面目已经揭穿了。这个反动小集团已经开始瓦解了。李金声承认了他在师范学院点火的反动言行，并承认了所谓离婚案件是向党进攻的幌子。少数曾被欺骗拉拢的学生也起来揭发这个小集团的罪恶活动。山东师范学院的全体师生，还严正地警告在北京的右派分子张友松，要他彻底交代进行反共反社会主义的罪行！
