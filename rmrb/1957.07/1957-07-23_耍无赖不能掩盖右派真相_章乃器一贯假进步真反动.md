    Playing the Rogue Cannot Hide the Truth of the Rightists: Zhang Naiqi Has Always Been a Fake Progressive and a True Reactionary
    (Our Dispatch) The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) continued to hold a joint expanded meeting on the 22nd to expose and criticize the speeches and actions of the rightist Zhang Naiqi against the leadership of the Party and against socialism. Through this exposure and criticism, Zhang Naiqi's reactionary face has been exposed more clearly, tearing off his mask of extorting the industrial and commercial circles and his disguise of progressiveness. Before the national liberation, he had close contact with some reactionary figures and secret service agents of the Kuomintang with ulterior motives. After liberation, he consistently distorted the Party and the state's policies toward the national bourgeoisie, maliciously provoking the relationship between the Party and the government and the national bourgeoisie, and forming small cliques with some people whose political faces were unclear, frantically attacking the Party and socialism. Zhang Naiqi still refused to attend yesterday's meeting.
    Zhang Naiqi organizes reactionary cliques, attacks Communist Party members and activists, and attempts to seize the leadership of the CDNCA.
    Huang Liangchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the CDNCA Central Committee, exposed Zhang Naiqi's conspiracy to organize an anti-Party clique within the CDNCA. In the early days of liberation, he began to place his cronies within the association. In recent years, he has used methods such as promising official positions and favors to collect some people with political and historical problems to form a group to be loyal to him. The members of this group include Ding Guozhen, Xu Hansan, Yang Meizhen, Lin Difei, Ding Yuchang, and Dai Jiaying. Ding Guozhen was a secret agent, Lin Difei's political and historical problems have not yet been explained to the organization, and Xu Hansan and Ding Yuchang are also people who have registered with the public security organs. The political faces of these people are enough to explain the nature of this group.
    Zhang Naiqi used this group to create divisions within the association, exclude dissidents, and conspire to seize the leadership of the association. He once instigated Lin Difei and Ding Yuchang to write letters (some signed, some anonymous) to the United Front Work Department, saying that there were sectarian activities within the CDNCA, and that the cross-over Party members in the CDNCA supported these activities. He also slandered the United Front Work Department for "drawing circles" in the democratic parties, "participating in sectarian activities," and "supporting a certain faction and suppressing dissenting elements and factions." Zhang Naiqi also provoked the unity of the leadership of the CDNCA Central Committee. He once said to Li Zhuchen: "Shi Fuliang is preparing to expel you from the association after the Three-Anti Campaign." Later, it was proved that this was completely fabricated by Zhang Naiqi.
    Zhang Naiqi's clique also attacked Communist Party members and activists, attempting to squeeze Party members out of the CDNCA and separate the CDNCA from the leadership of the Party. Zhang Naiqi once said: "Although Nan Hanchen and Wang Jihua are Communist Party members, their qualities are not as good as mine." He also often scolded Communist Party members as "Party officials" and people who "see themselves as superior to others." He once said to his lackeys that Li Weihan was "biased," Xu Bing was a bureaucrat, and Xu Dixin was a dogmatist. Zhang Naiqi instructed Lin Difei, Ding Yuchang, and others to write letters to the United Front Work Department, demanding the withdrawal of cross-over Party members Wang Jihua and Chen Naichang. At that time, Zeng Zhongming, who was used by him, also asked the United Front Work Department to remove Party members above the section chief level from the CDNCA, saying that not doing so "would harm the organizational independence of the democratic parties." At the same time, Zhang Naiqi also personally went to the United Front Work Department to maliciously exaggerate the shortcomings of comrades Wang Jihua and others.
    Another activity of this clique was to use its legal status to control propaganda organs and spread anti-Party and anti-socialist toxins. In order to realize this conspiracy, Zhang Naiqi first used his position as the director of the Propaganda and Education Committee to place his cronies in the Propaganda and Education Department and the "Minxun" editorial department. Then, he carried out large-scale poisoning activities. He once instructed Lin Difei: Public representatives should be criticized, and articles criticizing the negativity of the bourgeoisie should not be written. He also instructed "Minxun" to publish his reactionary remarks on a large scale, but refused to publish articles criticizing him.
    Zhang Naiqi is a political ambitionist cultivated by financial groups and warlords, and has thousands of connections with warlords and secret agents; after liberation, he still sheltered and reused counter-revolutionaries.
    Wang Xinyuan, Standing Committee member of the CDNCA Central Committee, said: Zhang Naiqi is a political ambitionist raised by Zhejiang financial groups and warlords.
    In Shanghai, he was initially half-hearted about the work of resisting Japan and saving the country, playing tricks, colluding with Pan Gongzhan, a reactionary leader of the Kuomintang, engaging in political speculation with Trotskyist Wang Gongdu, and running the "National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Committee" for Song Ziwen. Within the National Salvation Association, he tried to attack and exclude Shen Henglao, Zou Taofen, and other comrades who were close to the Party and supported the Party, attempting to make the National Salvation Association get rid of the Party's leadership. When Chiang Kai-shek suppressed the national salvation movement, he was "wrongly arrested"! He then asked Zhao Zhiyao, a confidant of Chen Cheng, for help, boasting that he was a "financial expert" who could "contribute to Chiang Kai-shek." Sure enough, after being released from prison, he betrayed the National Salvation Association and published an article in Shenbao entitled "Less Calls, More Suggestions," openly supporting Chiang and opposing the Communist Party's leadership of the anti-Japanese national salvation movement.
    During the Wuhan period, he offered suggestions to Chen Cheng to engage in the Three People's Principles Youth League. Chen Cheng wanted him to serve as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Three People's Principles Youth League, but he demanded to be the Director-General. Later, he looked for Gui-based warlord Li Zongren. At that time, Shen Henglao and other comrades of the National Salvation Association in Wuhan still wanted to save him and tried to persuade him "not to become an official." He did not listen, but under the guise of "unity against Japan," he went to Anhui to become a department head.
    During the Anhui period, Zhang Naiqi increased taxes on finance, issued bank notes, and organized five armed teams of tax collectors, got on the path of financial magnate Kong Xiangxi, and actively supported the rule of the Gui-based warlords. The worst thing was that he organized armed tax collection teams, which later became the vanguard of "anti-communism."
    During the Chongqing period, he continued to communicate with Pan Gongzhan through his secret service agent nephew Ji Hao. Comrades of the National Salvation Association believed that he had repeatedly refused to mend his ways and was getting worse and worse, and expelled him from the National Salvation Association.
    Wang Xinyuan also revealed that Zhang Naiqi sheltered counter-revolutionary elements Ding Guozhen, Chen Xianchi, Chen Shaoen, etc. after liberation, and placed them in the CDNCA to work. He also introduced work to Tong Guozhong, a secret service agent who had done many evils. These counter-revolutionary elements and secret agents were later discovered and suppressed, but he never confessed to the organization.
    Xiang De, a member of the CDNCA Central Committee, said: In 1950, Zhang Naiqi wrote a letter to me in the name of the general association to introduce Tong Guozhong. At that time, this person opened a factory and asked me and another person to guarantee a loan of 1,000 yuan from the bank. Soon, it was discovered that Tong was a counter-revolutionary element and was suppressed; the other guarantor was also a counter-revolutionary element and was arrested. The borrowed money was compensated by me, which caused me great political losses.
    Hu Ziying, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: On September 1, 1937, after Zhang Naiqi came out of prison, he wrote an article entitled "Less Calls, More Suggestions." In his article, Zhang Naiqi described the Communist Party's political calls for opening up mass organizations as "unconventional" and "factional," and "consuming national strength." His involvement in neighborhood and vocational organizations not only opposed the Communist Party's call to mobilize the whole nation to resist Japan, but also did a good job in political appeasement in the rear of the Kuomintang. He so obviously opposed the Communist Party and defended the Kuomintang. Can he be said to be "a person who, in the dark ages, under the threat and temptation of the enemy in every possible way, refused to oppose the Communist Party?" At that time, the Kuomintang did not threaten him, but he automatically provided hints of "temptation."
    At the end of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Zhang Naiqi wrote an inaugural speech for the CDNCA's organ publication "Pingmin." In the article, he equated the Kuomintang's reactionary "suppression of the communists" with the Communist Party's revolutionary military struggle, calling it a "struggle for power and profit among gentlemen." The political line of the CDNCA touted by Zhang Naiqi in this inaugural speech was also the bourgeois line of "not leaning right, not leaning left." However, Zhang Naiqi said in his so-called self-criticism that he was "a person who pursued socialism in the quagmire of capitalist society." Isn't this lying with his eyes open?
    Tan Zhiqin, Deputy Secretary-General of the CDNCA Central Committee, also revealed that Zhang Naiqi had connections with the people of the reactionary publication "Guangchang" of Peking University. He once provided them with some confidential reports and materials through Xu Nanting, the son of Xu Hansan, and praised Tan Tianrong in front of people, saying: Such a young man is really amazing.
    Xiao Xinzhi, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Commercial Research Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, exposed that Zhang Naiqi consistently distorted the Party's theory and policy toward the national bourgeoisie by using the method of mixing fish eyes with pearls.
    Tang Diyi, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, refuted Zhang Naiqi's fallacy that "the work efficiency of joint state-private enterprises is not as good as that of private enterprises" with the situation of the Shanghai Gold Pen Industry Joint Venture where she works.
    Wang Dafu, Director of the Organization Department of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, revealed Zhang Naiqi's relationship with Wang Liwen, a female secret agent of the Kuomintang.
    Leng Yu, Standing Committee member of the CDNCA Central Committee, Wu Gengmei, Central Committee member, Guo Dihuo, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Shaoyan, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhu Jisheng, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, Song Zichun, Chairman of the Shanxi Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhou Shutao, Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Jiang Peilu, Chairman of the Dalian Federation of Industry and Commerce, He Emei, member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, Liu Guojun, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Federation of Industry and Commerce, Mo Yichang, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, Wei Ru, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wu Dakun, member of the CDNCA Central Committee, Wang Biao, Deputy Director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CDNCA, and Bai Xiusheng, Director of the Organization Department, also spoke at the meeting in a joint statement. Li Baohe, a member of the CDNCA Central Committee, did not attend the meeting, and his speech was read by his daughter. In their speeches, they all strongly refuted Zhang Naiqi's false self-criticism and exposed Zhang Naiqi's criminal words and deeds against the Party and against socialism. Sun Caiping, who was abandoned by Zhang Naiqi, attended yesterday's meeting and spoke to expose Zhang Naiqi's criminal activities such as seeking refuge in the Kuomintang before liberation, as well as his despicable bourgeois qualities.
    Hu Ziang, the host of the meeting, announced to everyone at the end of the meeting: The meeting in the past few days has been very fruitful. Through everyone's exposure and criticism, Zhang Naiqi's mask of extorting the industrial and commercial circles and his ugly image have been peeled off. At the same time, the people who participated in the meeting also received an education in breaking capitalism and establishing socialism. Hu Ziang suggested that the central and local organizations of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce continue to popularize and deepen the anti-rightist struggle, thoroughly expose and criticize the adverse effects and consequences of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary words and deeds in the industrial and commercial circles. Those who have been adversely affected and captured by Zhang Naiqi in the past should quickly wake up, actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle, and educate and transform themselves.

    耍无赖不能掩盖右派真相
    章乃器一贯假进步真反动
    本报讯　民建中央和全国工商联常委会，22日继续举行联席扩大会议，对右派分子章乃器反对党的领导和反对社会主义的言行进行揭发和批判。通过这次的揭发和批判，章乃器的反动面目暴露得更加明显，揭去了他讹诈工商界的假面具和伪装进步的外衣。全国解放前，他就抱着不可告人的目的，同国民党的一些反动要人和特务分子密切往来；解放后他又一贯地歪曲党和国家对民族资产阶级的政策，恶意地挑拨党和政府同民族资产阶级的关系，并且同一些政治面貌不清的分子结成小集团，猖狂地向党和向社会主义进攻。章乃器仍然拒绝出席昨天的会议。章乃器组织反动小集团，打击共产党员和积极分子，企图夺取民建会的领导权
    民建中央副秘书长黄凉尘，揭发了章乃器在民建会内组织反党小集团的阴谋活动。解放初期，他就开始在会内安插他的亲信。近几年来，他更用封官许愿、施小恩小惠等手段，搜罗一些在政治历史上有问题的人，组成集团，为他效忠。这个集团的成员有丁国祯、许汉三、杨美真、林涤非、丁裕长、戴家瀛等人。丁国祯是特务，林涤非的政治历史问题至今还没有向组织上交代，许汉三、丁裕长也都是向公安机关登记过的分子。这些人的政治面貌，足以说明这个集团的本质。
    章乃器利用这个集团在会内制造分裂、排斥异己，阴谋夺取会的领导权。他曾唆使林涤非、丁裕长写信（有具名的，也有匿名的）给统战部，说民建会内有宗派活动，民建会内的交叉党员支持这些活动。并且污蔑统战部在民主党派中
  “划圈子”，“参加宗派活动”，
  “扶植某一个派别，压服意见不同的分子和派别”。章乃器还挑拨民建中央领导层的团结。他曾对李烛尘说：“施复亮在三反后，准备开除你出会。”后来证明，这完全是章乃器捏造的。
    章乃器小集团还打击共产党员和积极分子，企图把党员挤出民建会，使民建会脱离党的领导。章乃器曾经说：“南汉宸、王纪华虽是共产党员，但他们的品质还不及我。”他还经常骂共产党员是“党老爷”，是“见人高一等”的人。他曾对他的喽啰们说，李维汉是“偏听偏信”，徐冰是官僚主义者，许涤新是教条主义者。章乃器指使林涤非、丁裕长等写信给统战部，要求撤回交叉党员王纪华和陈乃昌。当时被他利用的曾仲铭，还向统战部要求把科长以上的党员撤离民建会，说不这样“就是伤害民主党派的组织独立性”。与此同时，章乃器还亲自出马去统战部，恶意夸大王纪华等同志的缺点。
    这个小集团的另一活动，是利用合法地位，控制宣传机构、散布反党反社会主义的毒素。为了实现这个阴谋，章乃器首先利用他宣教委员会主任委员的身份，把他的亲信安插在宣教处和“民讯”编辑部。然后，就大规模地进行放毒活动。他曾指示林涤非：对于公方代表应该批评，不要写批评资产阶级消极性的文章。他还指示“民讯”要大登他的反动言论，但是拒绝刊登批评他的文章。章乃器是由财阀、军阀培养出来的政治野心家，与军阀、特务有着千丝万缕的联系；解放以后仍然包庇重用反革命分子
    民建中央常委王新元说：章乃器是由浙江财阀与军阀所豢养出来的一个政治野心家。
    在上海时期，他一开始就对抗日救亡工作三心二意，玩弄两面手法，同国民党反动头子潘公展相勾搭，和托派王公度搞政治投机，为宋子文办“救国公债劝募委员会”。在救国会内则设法打击排斥靠拢党拥护党的沈衡老、邹韬奋诸同志，企图使救国会摆脱党的领导。在蒋介石镇压救亡运动时，他被“错捕”了！他就转托陈诚的亲信赵志尧向陈诚求救，吹嘘他是“理财专家”，可以替蒋介石“贡献微末”。果然出狱以后，他就叛卖了救国会，在申报发表“少号召多建议”的文章，公开拥蒋，反对共产党对抗日救亡运动的领导。
    在武汉时期，他为陈诚献策，搞三青团。陈诚要他担任三青团中央干事会干事，而他要求作总干事。后来，他又找桂系军阀李宗仁，当时在武汉的沈衡老等救国会的同志们，还想挽救他，力劝他“不要做官”，他不听，而以“团结抗日”为幌子，到安徽去做了厅长。
    在安徽时期：章乃器在财政方面加捐加税，发行银行本票，组织五个稽征的武装队伍，钻上了财阀孔祥熙的门路，积极的支持了桂系军阀的统治。最坏的是他组织武装稽征队，以后变成了“反共”的先锋。
    在重庆时期，他通过他的特务外甥季灏的关系，继续和潘公展来往。救国会诸同志认为他屡劝不改，愈弄愈糟，开除了他的救国会的会籍。
    王新元还揭发章乃器在解放后包庇反革命分子丁国桢、陈咸池、陈绍恩等，并把他们安插在民建会工作，他还给作恶多端的特务童国忠介绍工作。这些反革命分子和特务后来都被发现和镇压了。但从未向组织上坦白交代。
    民建中央委员向德说：1950年章乃器以总会名义，写信向我介绍童国忠。当时，这个人开了一个工厂，要我和另一个人作保，向银行借款一千元。不久，就发现童是反革命分子，被镇压了；另一个作保的人也是反革命分子，被逮捕了。所借款项由我赔出，使我在政治上受到很大损失。
    上海市工商联副主委胡子婴说：1937年9月1日，章乃器从监狱中出来后，就写了一篇“少号召，多建议”的文章。章乃器在他的文章中，把共产党要求开放民众组织的政治号召说成是“标新立异”、
  “派别之见”，是“消耗国力”的。他去搞里弄组织和职业组织，不仅同共产党动员全民抗日的号召相对抗，而且为国民党的后方做好政治绥靖工作。他如此明显地反对共产党、维护国民党，能够说是“在黑暗时代里，在敌人千方百计的威胁利诱之下，都不肯反共的人”吗？当时的国民党并没有对他威胁，倒是他自动提供了“利诱”的暗示。
    1945年抗日战争结束，章乃器为民建的机关刊物“平民”写过一篇发刊词。他在文中把国民党的反动“剿共”和共产党的革命军事斗争等量齐观，说成是“大人先生们的争权夺利”。章乃器在这篇发刊词中所标榜的民建的政治路线，也是“不右倾，不左袒”的资产阶级路线，可是章乃器在他的所谓检讨中却说，他是“一个在资本主义社会的泥坑里就追求社会主义的人”，这不是睁着眼睛说谎是什么？
    民建中央副秘书长谭志清还揭露，章乃器同北京大学反动刊物
  “广场”的人有联系。他曾经通过许汉三的儿子许南亭，供给他们一些秘密报告和材料，并且当着人夸奖谭天荣说：这样的青年真了不起。
    民建北京市委会工商研究处副处长肖心之揭发章乃器一贯地用鱼目混珠的办法，歪曲党对民族资产阶级的理论和政策。
    上海市工商联副主任委员汤蒂因，以她所在的上海金笔业合营后的情况，驳斥了章乃器的“公私合营企业的工作效率反而不如私营时期”的谬论。
      全国工商联组织处长王达夫揭发章乃器同国民党女特务王立文的关系。
    在会上发言的还有民建中央常务委员冷遹、中央委员吴羹梅、上海市工商联副主委郭棣活、云南省工商联副主委王少岩、民建天津市主委朱继圣、山西省工商联主委宋子纯、全国工商联常务委员周叔弢、旅大市工商联主委姜培禄、上海市民建会委员何萼梅、江苏省工商联副主委刘国钧、北京市民建会副主委莫艺昌、上海市工商联副主委魏如、民建中央委员吴大琨，北京市民建宣教处副处长汪镳和组织处处长白秀生作了联合发言，民建中委李葆和没有出席会议，他的发言稿由他女儿代读。他们在发言中都对章乃器的假检讨作了有力驳斥，并揭发了章乃器反党反社会主义的罪恶言行。被章乃器遗弃的孙采苹列席了昨天的会议，并且发言揭发了章乃器在解放前投靠国民党等罪恶活动，以及他的卑劣的资产阶级的品质。
    会议的主持人胡子昂在散会时，向大家宣布：几天来的会议有很大收获，经过大家的揭露批判，把章乃器讹诈工商界的假面具和丑恶形象剥开了。同时参加会的人也接受了一次破资本主义，立社会主义的教育。胡子昂建议民建和工商联的中央和地方组织把反右派斗争继续普及和深入下去，彻底揭露并批判章乃器的反动言行在工商界中造成的不良影响和恶果。过去受过章乃器不良影响和俘虏的人，应赶快觉悟过来，积极参加反右派斗争，教育改造自己。
