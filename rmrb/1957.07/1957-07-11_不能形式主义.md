Cannot Be Formalistic
Li Huifu

In implementing the policy of democratic management of cooperatives, more than 90% of agricultural cooperatives in Shuangfeng County have disclosed their accounts to their members. After these cooperatives cleared and made public their accounts, they corrected many errors in accounting, resolved some outstanding issues, and greatly increased the labor enthusiasm of the members, which played a significant role in consolidating the agricultural cooperatives. Zhao Xisheng, a member of the Longqiao Cooperative in Yangliu Township, used to suspect the cooperative's accounts were unreliable, and often did not work diligently; after the accounts were disclosed, he earned nine hundred work points in three months. Sun Hansheng, a member of the Daqiao Cooperative, had twenty-five yuan transferred to him last year, but it was mistakenly written as two yuan and five jiao in the account, which was corrected during the disclosure of accounts. He was very satisfied. After the Bawan Cooperative in Guangchong Township disclosed its accounts, members invested 294 yuan in cash in May alone, more than the total cash invested in the previous half year.

However, there are still many problems in the work of publicizing financial revenues and expenditures. First, some agricultural cooperatives are formalistic in disclosing their accounts. Many agricultural cooperatives, when disclosing their accounts, simply have the accountant create a "capital balance sheet" and several "detailed statements," and hand them over to the team leader, considering the job done. Because they regard the disclosure of accounts as a routine "pro forma" task, the disclosed "accounts" are not seen by the masses, and although the accounts are disclosed at the top, the members are unaware. The accountant of the Shuangchong Cooperative in Yangliu Township disclosed the accounts three times, but even the custodian was unaware.

Second is the issue of the content of the disclosed accounts. Many cooperatives only create a "balance sheet of current amounts for general ledger accounts" according to the textbook, with only a few general ledger accounts, debit and credit amounts, and balances. Members cannot understand it, which is equivalent to not disclosing it. There are also some agricultural cooperatives that do not disclose accounts comprehensively or in a timely manner. According to statistics from 814 agricultural cooperatives, in May, 795 cooperatives disclosed work point accounts, 705 cooperatives disclosed investment accounts, and 690 cooperatives disclosed member transaction accounts; 147 cooperatives, accounting for 18% of the total, did not disclose or did not disclose in a timely manner. Particularly serious is that most agricultural cooperatives did not separately disclose cash receipts and payments, and product harvest and distribution accounts, which members are particularly concerned about. The existence of these problems prevents this important measure of democratic cooperative management, the disclosure of finances, from achieving its due effect in some agricultural cooperatives, thus hindering the consolidation and development of these agricultural cooperatives.

How can we do a good job in disclosing financial revenues and expenditures? First of all, leaders at all levels and all rural cadres must truly understand the importance of disclosing financial revenues and expenditures; at the same time, we must educate financial and accounting personnel to settle down and work, overcome the erroneous idea of being afraid of trouble, and help them solve some practical problems.

Secondly, the content of the disclosure should be easy to understand and tailored to the tastes of farmers; the method should be simple and easy to implement, and within the capacity of the accountant. From the past situation, what members are most concerned about are: the cooperative's cash receipts and expenditures, the harvest and distribution of products, individual work points, investments and transactions, the handling of state loans and relief funds, basic construction investments, work point subsidies for cooperative cadres, care for the "five guarantees" households and households in difficulty, and preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. We must promptly disclose these accounts according to these requirements of the members. In terms of the timing of disclosure, cash receipts and expenditures, and the three accounts of individual members, should be disclosed once a month, while other matters should be disclosed immediately after they occur. As for the cooperative's fixed assets (cattle, farm implements, etc.), miscellaneous items, members' share funds, and the "three guarantees" figures for each team, they can be disclosed once every six months, or once a year.

To oppose formalism in the disclosure of financial revenues and expenditures, we must educate cooperative management cadres and all financial and accounting personnel to frequently listen to the opinions of the masses and meet the demands of the masses. The disclosure of financial revenues and expenditures should be done in a way that everyone knows and everyone is happy.

    不能形式主义
    李惠夫
    在贯彻民主办社方针中，双峰县有90％以上的农业社向社员公布了账目。这些社清理、公开了社的账目以后，在账务上纠正了很多差错，解决了一些遗留问题，社员的劳动积极性大为提高，对巩固农业社起了很大作用。杨柳乡龙乔社社员赵喜生，过去怀疑社里的账目不可靠，经常不出工，懒心懒意；公布账目以后，三个月做了九百个工分。大乔社社员孙汉生，去年转过来二十五元，账上写错为两块五角钱，在公布账目中得到了纠正。他非常满意。光冲乡八湾社公布账目以后，5月份一个月内社员投入现金达二百九十四元，比前半年内投入的现金总数还要多。
    但是，在公开财政收支工作中还存在许多问题。首先是，有的农业社在公布账目中有形式主义。不少农业社在公布账目时，由会计员造出一个“资金平衡表”和几个“明细表”，向队长一交，就算万事大吉。因为他们把公布账目当成奉行公事的“照例文章”，所公布的“账目”没有与群众见面，上面公布了账目，社员还不知道有这回事。杨柳乡双冲社会计员公布了三次账目，连保管员也不知道。
    其次是，公布账目的内容问题。不少社公布的账目，只是按教材上的规定，造出一张“总账账户本期发生额对照表”，上面只有几个总账账户，借方、贷方金额以及余额。社员们看不懂，等于没有公布。还有一些农业社公布的账目不全面，不及时。据八百一十四个农业社的统计，5月份内，公布了工分账的七百九十五个社，公布了投资账的有七百零五个社，公布了社员往来账的有六百九十个社，没有公布和没有及时公布的还有一百四十七个社，占总数的18％。尤其严重的是，社员特别关心的现金收付、产品收获分配账，大部分农业社没有单独公布。这些问题的存在，使公开财政这一项民主办社的重要措施，在某些农业社不能收到应有的效果，因而阻碍了这些农业社的巩固和发展。
    怎样才能做好公开财政收支呢？首先，各级领导和全体农村干部，都要真正懂得公开财政收支的重要意义；同时，要教育财会人员安心工作，克服怕麻烦的错误思想，并帮助他们解决一些实际问题。
    其次，公布的内容应该通俗易懂，适合农民口味；方式应简单易行，为会计的力量所能及。从过去一段情况来看，社员最关心的是：社内现金的收支、产品的收获和分配，个人的工分、投资和往来，以及国家发放的贷款、救济款的处理，基本建设投资、社干工分补贴、五保户和困难户的照顾、烈军属的优待等。我们必须根据社员的这些要求，及时地把这些账目公布。在公布的时间上，现金收支，社员个人的三笔账，以一个月公布一次为宜，其他事项则应该在发生后马上公布。至于社内的固定资产（耕牛、农具等）、杂项物品、社员的股份基金、各队的“三包”数字等，可以半年公布一次，也可以全年公布一次。
    要反对公开财政收支中的形式主义，必须教育办社干部和全体财会人员，经常听取群众意见，满足群众要求。公开财政收支要求做到家喻户晓，大家欢喜。
