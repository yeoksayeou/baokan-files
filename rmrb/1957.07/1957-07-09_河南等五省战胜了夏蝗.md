Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: The 15.5 million mu of summer locusts in five provinces – Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui – and the suburban areas of Tianjin have been basically eliminated. Currently, various localities are capturing and controlling the remaining locusts.

This year, the area of summer locust occurrence and spread in the coastal, lakeside, and waterlogged areas of these five provinces and one city is the largest since liberation. The main reason for this situation is the larger area of summer locust occurrence and spread in the waterlogged areas of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. According to statistics, the summer locust area in the waterlogged areas of these three provinces accounts for more than half of the summer locust area in the five provinces and one city.

After discovering the locust situation, various localities began organizing large amounts of material and manpower to capture and control them, starting in late May. After a tense battle, by the end of June, the summer locusts in various locust areas were basically eliminated, and they did not take flight and cause disaster.

Currently, the remaining summer locusts have begun to mate and lay eggs. On the one hand, various localities must do a good job in sweeping up the remaining summer locusts; on the other hand, they must do a good job in preparing for the prevention and control of autumn locusts, so as to eliminate autumn locusts before the third instar.

    河南等五省战胜了夏蝗
    据新华社6日讯　河北、河南、山东、江苏、安徽五省和天津市郊区的一千五百五十万亩夏蝗，已经基本消灭，当前各地正在捕治残蝗。
    这五省一市的沿海滨湖和内涝地区，今年夏蝗发生和扩散的面积，是解放后最大的一年。造成这种情况的原因，主要是河北、河南、山东三省的内涝地区，今年夏蝗发生和扩散的面积较大。据统计：这三个省内涝地区的夏蝗面积，即占五省一市夏蝗面积一半以上。
    各地发现蝗情以后，从5月下旬开始先后组织大量物力、人力进行捕治。经过紧张的战斗，到6月底，各个蝗区的夏蝗即被基本消灭，没有起飞成灾。
    目前，夏蝗残蝗已经开始交尾产卵。各地一方面要做好夏蝗扫残工作；另方面要做好防治秋蝗的准备工作，以便把秋蝗消灭在三龄以前。
