We fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Chief Procurator Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. Now, we would like to express some opinions on the issue of actively developing China's shipbuilding industry.

In the years since liberation, China's shipbuilding industry has made great progress under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. The shipbuilding industry in old China was essentially a repair and assembly industry. So-called shipbuilding was merely assembly work done in China using foreign materials and foreign machinery. Now we are able to build complex naval vessels that we could not build before, and we have independently designed and are building a coastal oil tanker with a displacement of over 7,000 tons (i.e., a 4,500-ton oil tanker) at the Dalian Shipyard. We have also designed a coastal cargo ship with a displacement of 8,000 tons (i.e., a 5,000-ton cargo ship) and are preparing to design and build ocean-going cargo ships with a displacement of approximately 20,000 tons. The technological level of the shipbuilding industry has made leaps and bounds in recent years. Several new shipyards have been built, and the ranks of the shipbuilding industry have grown stronger than before, laying the foundation for further development. All these achievements should be affirmed.

However, compared with other socialist countries, China possesses three superior conditions: favorable climate, ports that do not freeze and have small water level differences between winter and summer, and a considerable number of skilled workers. At the same time, China has more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline, hundreds of thousands of kilometers of navigable waterways, and abundant materials available for transportation. However, the backward state of China's shipbuilding industry is not commensurate with these superior conditions, and these favorable conditions have not been fully utilized, which is an issue worthy of our attention.

We – as technical personnel in the shipbuilding industry – have the following opinions on the development of China's shipbuilding industry.

I. On the Issue of Shipbuilding Scientific Research

The main task of shipbuilding scientific research is to solve problems that ordinary personnel cannot solve. The Soviet Union and other countries attach great importance to shipbuilding scientific research. Research work is not only carried out in formal research institutions, but also involves planned coordination between various universities and factory laboratories. As a result, in the past twenty years, the economic efficiency of ship performance has improved by an average of one percent per year in terms of the hull and also in terms of the engine. This improvement in economic efficiency is the result of the attention and effort that countries have given to shipbuilding scientific research, and it is by no means accidental.

In China, in terms of shipbuilding scientific research, there is only one shipbuilding scientific research institute in Shanghai, and its scale is very small, which cannot meet the needs of the future development of the shipbuilding industry. Currently, the institute's main equipment is only a small test pool (Shanghai Shipbuilding College recently built a 100-meter-long pool, and all instruments will be shipped from abroad in the third quarter of this year for installation), which was built after liberation. Building such a small pool at that time was because of investment constraints, to accumulate experience and train personnel, which was not necessarily bad; but if we want to do more precise tests, such equipment is not sufficient. Because the pool is small, the ship model used is small, and the results obtained cannot be very accurate. The internationally recognized standard is a 6-meter ship model, and the length of the pool is approximately 50 to 60 times the length of the ship model. Therefore, the institute's pool should be expanded to 300 to 400 meters to meet future needs. At the same time, it should also be equipped with shallow water pools, seaworthiness pools, as well as research and testing equipment for ship structures, vibrations, mechanical devices, and shipbuilding materials. In order to improve the level of shipbuilding science and technology, enriching the equipment within the shipbuilding scientific research institute is an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. We and the research staff believe that the research and construction investment in the Second Five-Year Plan should be around 10 million yuan, which is a minimum figure, and we hope that the competent authorities will support it.

II. The Shipbuilding Industry Needs Collaboration and Support

The shipbuilding industry is the largest comprehensive industry, requiring the cooperation of various heavy industries. Based on our experience in shipbuilding work in recent years, the cooperation and support from other industries such as the metallurgical industry, the machinery industry, and the electrical industry are not sufficient. First, let's talk about the metallurgical industry. Currently, in addition to being able to produce some steel for inland river ships, the steel used for ocean-going ships is not produced in large quantities. Currently, the steel used for repairing and building ocean-going ships is imported. For example, when we repair Soviet ocean-going ships, the delivery deadline is often affected because the steel supply is not timely. This issue, whether from the perspective of the shipbuilding industry or from the perspective of saving foreign exchange, is worthy of our careful consideration and research to resolve. Secondly, the power engines installed on ships, the domestically produced ones are of small horsepower. In the past, the main engines of most civilian ships were manufactured by factories under the Shipbuilding Industry Bureau. Those ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 horsepower were reciprocating steam engines. A 2,400-horsepower uniflow steam engine is currently being test-manufactured but has not yet been completed. Diesel engines above 1,000 horsepower and larger marine turbines cannot be manufactured domestically. Recently, the Fourth Machinery Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building has prepared to design and manufacture large marine turbines, which will greatly advance the performance of China's marine main engines. At the same time, we also hope that the First Ministry of Machine Building will consider manufacturing low-speed diesel engines as soon as possible. Design data can be purchased from foreign countries to avoid detours. Attention should be paid to this when determining the development direction of the Second Five-Year Plan. If the manufacturing problems of turbines and diesel engines are solved, we will be able to cooperate with the needs of the transportation sector and design and manufacture several basic ship types needed during their Second and Third Five-Year Plans. Other industries such as the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, the paint industry, and the timber industry, we hope, can also consider the special needs of ships. Marine electrical machinery is diverse, requiring small size, light weight, and sometimes enclosed type; cables sometimes also have special requirements. Export ships must meet international standards. At present, materials such as paint and timber are often difficult to meet ideal standards. In recent years, when repairing and building Soviet ships, unnecessary disputes have often arisen because domestic equipment failed to meet Soviet specifications. In short, the special requirements we have put forward for marine equipment have generally not been accepted by all parties, making us very passive in our work. We hope that relevant departments can provide more cooperation and support to the shipbuilding industry. Moreover, the cooperation of large industrial enterprises alone is not enough. Conditions should also be created for the shipbuilding industry to have some necessary satellite factories, such as navigation instruments and non-standard marine products. These factories can take the form of direct operation by the shipbuilding industry department or fixed cooperative relationships. Without cooperation and support, the shipbuilding industry cannot perform a solo act.

III. The Shipbuilding Industry Should Be Valued and Placed in Its Proper Position

Every day, we can see foreign ships entering and leaving Shanghai ports, busily transporting foreign equipment and various industrial and agricultural products from China. If we calculate based on an annual cargo volume of 10 million tons (this figure is not large), with an average voyage of 10,000 nautical miles per ton of cargo, and approximately eight pounds of freight paid per ton of cargo, that would be 80 million pounds a year. If export goods account for half of that, the foreign exchange paid annually would be 40 million pounds, equivalent to approximately 300 million yuan. If a portion of the cargo is handled by our own ships, we can save a sum of foreign exchange.

We believe that the foreign trade and transportation departments do not have the determination to actively strive for self-provided ships and self-transportation of goods, and they have not loudly called for attention to this matter from relevant domestic parties early on. They are indifferent to the large amount of foreign exchange to be paid for freight each year, so that the industrial departments cannot well organize forces to solve the problem of self-construction of ocean-going ships. During the First Five-Year Plan, although China achieved some success in building small and medium-sized ships, the construction of large ships has hardly begun.

Ocean-going ships (with a load of around 10,000 tons) that bear the burden of ocean transportation entering and leaving Shanghai ports and other ports are the most widely used type of ships in the world today. Can China build them? We believe that building 10,000-ton ocean-going ships is not without some difficulties, but they can be overcome. With the existing foundation of China's shipbuilding industry and machinery industry in recent years, as long as it is well organized and some measures are taken, the production of 10,000-ton ocean-going ships can begin quickly. The first thing here is the issue of the base for building ocean-going ships. Building new factories takes a relatively long time, and the investment is also relatively large; however, renovating some old factories with a foundation can allow for production while renovating, especially shipyards that have experience in repairing and refitting large ships. The renovation work of these factories should be finalized as soon as possible and actively accelerated.

IV. Disagreeing with the "Waiting" Argument

There is now an opinion that we should wait for the metallurgical, machinery, electrical, and other industries to develop sufficiently before developing the shipbuilding industry. There is only a small amount of truth to this. Capitalist countries have had this situation in their natural development trend. However, this is not the case for all countries. Maritime countries such as Britain and Japan are prominent examples. Socialist construction is a proportional and balanced planned construction, and should be developed in a corresponding manner, without waiting for each other. If one link waits for another to wait, how can China's shipbuilding technology reach the world's advanced level in twelve years? As for some particularly difficult components in the shipbuilding industry that cannot be solved domestically at present, fraternal countries will still need to cooperate and help in a certain period, but we cannot abandon the development of the shipbuilding industry just because there are some difficulties.

V. Striving to Repair and Build Foreign Ships to Balance Foreign Exchange

Building our own ships and transporting our own materials can save some foreign exchange, which is a benefit of developing the shipbuilding industry. In addition, according to our understanding, the world shipbuilding industry has been unprecedentedly prosperous in recent years. The shipbuilding industries of countries such as Japan, Britain, and West Germany are extremely tight. Japan's shipbuilding tasks have been scheduled until 1960. It is not easy to order ships from them. In recent years, China has repaired and built some ships for the Soviet Union and other countries. Although the foreign exchange obtained is not much, the implementation of the Soviet ship inspection specifications has brought no small gains in improving the technical level of China's shipbuilding industry. At the same time, the work of repairing and building ships for the Soviet Union has solved the difficulties of insufficient production tasks and surplus labor in various factories, and has also solved part of the Soviet Union's Far East ship repair problems, playing a role in the Soviet Union's maritime transport. The quality of the ships that have been delivered also meets international standards and has been praised by the Soviet user units. Therefore, on this basis, we can further develop and strive for foreign new ship orders. A 5,000-ton ocean-going ship is worth about 6 to 7 million yuan, which is equivalent to the export of how many apples, oranges, and pork!

In order to export ships and earn foreign exchange, in recent years, it is worthwhile to import some foreign equipment for processing and construction before exporting, even if it involves importing foreign materials. China has abundant manpower and can engage in foreign trade in the form of "technical labor," which is much better than exporting agricultural products. Judging from the unprecedented prosperity of the world shipbuilding industry in recent years and China's technical level, striving for "technical labor" exports has a future. At the same time, we still hope that relevant departments will actively carry out the large-scale production of marine steel and the manufacture of large main engines, so as to gradually achieve the goal of building foreign ships with domestic equipment.

VI. What is the Key Issue?

In order for the shipbuilding industry to have further development during the Second Five-Year Plan, we believe that the following points should be grasped tightly at present:

1.  Organize ship orders as soon as possible, including domestic and foreign ones. The State Planning Commission should confirm the shipbuilding tasks in batches, determine the ship types, and immediately organize the design work. For domestic tasks, domestic self-manufacturing must be carried out where it is possible. If there are some difficulties in domestic self-manufacturing, we must also try our best to overcome the difficulties and strive to make it domestically. Due to the limitations of China's industrial and technological level, the ships built may not be ideal. The shipbuilding industry department should strive for excellence and strive to gradually improve. The user departments should also understand the situation and first seek to be able to build and use. As for foreign tasks, it is also necessary to use some foreign technical assistance and imported foreign equipment in recent years.

2.  Organize collaboration as soon as possible. As mentioned above, the shipbuilding industry department alone cannot perform a solo act. It must have the collaboration and support of other industries, especially the metallurgical, machinery, and electrical industries. The steel, main engines, and electrical appliances required for ships during the Second Five-Year Plan should be organized for trial manufacturing and production as soon as possible. In particular, solving the problem of new large ship engines is particularly urgent.

3.  During the First Five-Year Plan, some shipyards were newly built and renovated, laying some foundations; however, the efforts for building large ships are still not enough. The technological equipment for building large ships is still very backward. This situation must be reversed quickly, and some old factories with a foundation must be quickly renovated to meet the needs of the Second Five-Year Plan. In order to build large ships, the renovation work must be actively carried out, and there must be no more hesitation or waiting.

Finally, we would like to state our attitude here. Since liberation, we technical personnel have been conscientiously engaged in socialist construction under the leadership of the Party. However, some right-wing elements have taken advantage of the Party's rectification opportunity to carry out subversive activities, which we cannot tolerate. We are determined to draw a clear line with them and carry out a sharp struggle. At the same time, in this struggle, we will further improve our own political and ideological level, closely unite around the Party and the government, and contribute all our strength to further developing the shipbuilding industry.

### 进一步发展我国造船工业  杨俊生、萨本炘的联合发言

专栏：

    进一步发展我国造船工业
    杨俊生、萨本炘的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的报告。现在，我们对积极发展我国造船工业问题，发表一些意见。
    解放后几年来，我国造船工业在党和政府的正确领导下，已有很大的发展。旧中国的造船工业，实际上是修配工业；所谓造船，只是用外国材料，外国机器在中国作一些装配工作而已。现在我们已经能够建造以前不能造的复杂的舰艇，自行设计和正在大连造船厂建造的七千多吨排水量的沿海油轮（即四千五百吨装油量沿海油轮），已设计八千吨排水量的沿海货轮（即五千吨载货量沿海货轮），还准备设计和建造约二万吨排水量的远洋货轮。几年来造船工业的技术水平，有了飞跃的进步。兴建了好几个新型船厂，造船工业的队伍是较前壮大了，已经为进一步的发展打下了基础。所有这些成绩，都是应该肯定的。
    但是，我国与其他社会主义国家比较起来，具有天时、地利、人和三种优良条件。即温和的气候、不冻及冬夏季水位落差不大的港口、相当数量的技术工人。同时，我国又有一万二千余公里海岸线，数十万公里可通航的河道，丰富的物资可供运输等条件。而我国造船工业的落后状态，和这些优越条件是不相称的，这些有利条件还没有被充分的利用起来，这是值得我们重视的一个问题。
    我们——作为造船工业的技术人员来说，对于我国造船工业的发展问题，有下面几点意见。
    一、关于造船科学研究工作问题
    造船科学研究工作的主要任务是解决一般人员所不能解决的问题。苏联和其他国家对造船科学研究工作是很重视的，研究工作不仅在正规的研究机关内进行，而且还有计划的组织各高等学校和工厂的实验室密切地配合工作。因此，近二十年来世界上船舶性能的经济效能，在船体方面平均每年提高百分之一，在轮机方面也是如此。这种经济效能的提高，是各国对造船科学研究工作重视和努力的结果，绝不是偶然的事。
    我国在造船科学研究方面，仅在上海有一个造船科学研究所，而且规模很小，不能适应今后船舶工业发展的需要。现在该所主要的设备仅有一个小型试验水池（上海造船学院最近新建了一个长一百公尺的水池，所有仪器将于今年第三季度自国外陆续运到装置），是解放后兴建的，一九五四年开始做船模拖曳试验。当时兴建这样一个小的水池，是因为受投资限制，用以来积累经验和训练人员，尚未始不可；如要进一步做精密试验，这样的设备就太不够了。因为水池小，船模用得小，所得结果就不可能很准确。国际间公认的标准是六公尺的船模，水池长度大约为船模的五十到六十多倍。因此，该所水池要扩大到三百到四百公尺，才能适应今后需要。同时，还应配备浅水池，适航性水池以及船舶结构、振动、机械装置和造船材料等研究试验设备。为了提高造船科学技术水平，造船科学研究所内设备的充实，是一个迫切需要解决的问题，我们和研究工作人员考虑，认为在第二个五年计划研究建设投资希望应有一千万元左右，这是一个最低限度的数字，希望主管机关予以支持。
    二、造船工业需要协作和支持
    造船工业是最大的综合性工业，需要各种重工业的配合，根据我们几年来从事造船工作的体会，其他工业如冶金工业、机械工业、电机工业等和我们的协作以及对我们的支持是不够的。首先讲冶金工业。现在我国除能生产一部分内河船用钢材外，海轮用的钢材，还没有大量生产，现在修造海轮用钢材都是进口货，如我们修苏联海轮，因钢材供应不及时，往往影响交货期限。这一问题，不论是从船舶工业来说，从节用外汇来说，都是值得我们慎重考虑和研究解决的。其次，船上所装的动力机，国内所生产的是小马力的，过去绝大多数民用船舶的主机是船舶工业局所属各厂自己制造的，一千到二千马力的都是往复式蒸气机，现正试造二千四百马力单流式蒸气机，还未完成，一千马力以上的柴油机和较大马力的船用气轮机，国内还不能制造。最近第一机械工业部第四机械工业局已准备设计制造大型船用气旋机，将使我国船用主机的性能，大大地向前迈进一步。同时我们还希望一机部及早考虑制造低速柴油机，设计资料可向外国购买，免得多走弯路，在确定第二个五年计划发展方针时即宜注意及此。要是气旋机，柴油机制造问题都解决了，我们就能配合交通部门的需要，设计制造他们在第二个、第三个五年计划期间所需要的几种基本船型。其他如电机制造工业、油漆工业、木材工业等，都希望能考虑一下船舶的特殊需要。船上用电机是多种多样的，要求体积小、重量轻，有时要封闭式的；电缆有时也有特殊要求。出口船舶必须符合国际标准。目前油漆、木材等材料往往难得符合理想，近几年来修造苏联船舶，因国产器材未能达到苏方规格，往往引起不必要的争论。总之，对于船用器材，我们所提出的特殊要求，一般尚未为各方面所接受，使我们在工作中非常被动。我们希望有关部门对造船工业能更多的协作和支持。而且，仅是大的工业企业的协作是不够的，还应该为造船工业创造条件，使它能有一些必要的卫星工厂，如航行仪表、船用非标准的制品等，这些工厂可以采取造船工业部门直接经营或固定协作关系的形式。没有协作支持，船舶工业唱独角戏是唱不起来的。
    三、应该重视造船工业，把它摆到应有的位置上来
    我们每天可以看到进出上海港口的外国船只，繁忙地运来了国外的器材，运走了我国的各种工农业产品。假使以每年一千万吨的货运量来计算（这个数字是不大的），每吨货物平均一万海浬运程，每吨货物大约要付八个英镑的运费，一年就是八千万镑。如果出口物资占一半，一年要付外汇四千万英镑折合人民币约三亿多元。假使有一部分货运由我国自己的船舶来担当，就可以节省一笔外汇。
    我们认为：外贸和运输部门没有积极争取自备船舶、自运货物的决心，没有及早的把这件事大声疾呼地引起国内有关方面的注意，对每年要付大量外汇作运费不以为意，从而工业部门便不能很好的组织力量解决自行建造海洋船舶的问题。在第一个五年计划期间，我国在建造中小型船舶方面虽获得一点成绩，但大型船舶的建造工作几乎还没有开始。
    进出上海港和其他港口负担远洋运输的远洋船（载重万吨左右），是现在世界上使用最广泛的一种类型的船舶，我国是否能够建造呢？我们认为，要建造万吨远洋船，不是没有一些困难，但是可以克服的，以我国近年来造船工业和机械工业已有的基础，只要组织得好，采取一些措施，万吨远洋船可以很快的开工生产。这里首先是建造远洋船的基地问题，建设新厂时间是比较长的，投资也是比较大的；但改建一些有基础的老厂，可以边改建、边生产，特别是有修理和改装大型船舶的船厂，对于这些厂的改建工作，应该及早定案，积极地加速进行。
    四、不同意等待的论点
    现在有这样一种意见，认为要等待冶金、机械、电机等工业有了足够的发展，才能发展船舶工业。这只有一小部分道理，资本主义国家自然发展趋势曾有过这一情况。但是也不是所有国家都是如此，英国、日本等海运国就是显著的例子。社会主义建设是按比例平衡的有计划的建设，应当相应的配合发展，不能彼此等待。若一环等一环的等待下去，我国的造船技术在十二年内如何能够达到世界先进水平呢？至于造船工业中有一些特别困难的机件，目前国内不能解决，在一定时期内仍需兄弟国家协作帮助，但总不能因为有一些困难而就放弃造船工业的发展。五、争取修造外国船舶，平衡外汇
    自造船舶，自运物资，可以节省部分外汇，这是发展造船工业一个方面的好处。除此以外，据我们了解，最近几年世界造船工业空前景气，日本、英国、西德等国家造船业异常紧张，日本的造船任务已排至一九六○年。要向他们订购船只颇不容易。我国几年来曾为苏联及其他国家修造了一些船只，所获得的外汇虽不算多，但通过苏联验船规范的执行，对提高我国船舶工业技术水平，收获却不算少。同时，对苏修造船出口工作，解决了各厂生产任务不足、劳动力过剩等困难，也解决了苏方远东船舶的一部分修理问题，对苏方的海运起了一些作用。已经交出去的船舶质量，也都合乎国际标准，获得了苏方使用单位的赞扬。因此，在这个基础上，可以进一步发展，争取外国新船订货。一条五千吨海轮，约值人民币六、七百万元，要抵上多少苹果、桔子、猪肉的出口啊！
    为了造船出口，争取外汇，在最近几年，即使进口一些外国器材加工建造后再出口也是合算的。我国人力充足，能以“技术劳动”的形式对外贸易，比农产品出口优越得多。从近年世界造船工业的空前景气和我国的技术水平来说，争取“技术劳动”出口是有前途的。同时，对船用钢材的大量生产和大型主机的制造等，仍望有关部门积极进行，以期逐步做到用本国器材造外国船舶。
    六、关键问题是什么？
    为了使造船工业能在第二个五年计划期间有进一步的发展，我们认为当前应抓紧下列几点：
    1．从速组织船舶订货，包括国内的和国外的，由国家计委分批的把造船任务肯定下来，确定船型，并即组织设计工作。凡是国内任务，能国内自造的必须国内自造，在国内自造有些困难的，也要尽量设法克服困难在国内勉力自造。由于我国工业技术水平的限制，所造船舶可能不尽理想。造船工业部门应该精益求精，力求逐步提高；使用部门也要体谅情况，先求能造能用。至于国外任务，在近几年内需用些国外技术协助及进口的国外器材，也是必要的。
    2．从速组织协作。上面说过，光是造船工业部门，独角戏是唱不起来的，必须其他工业协作支持，特别是冶金、机械、电机等工业。第二个五年计划期间所需船用的钢材、主机、电器，应及早组织试造和生产。特别是解决新式大型船机问题，尤为迫切。
    3．在第一个五年计划期间新建、改建了一些船厂，打下了一些基础；但对于建造大型船舶还是努力不够的。造大船的工艺装备还很落后，必须迅速扭转这一情况，迅速改建一些有基础的老厂，以适应第二个五年计划的需要。为了建造大型船舶，改建工作必须积极进行，不能再犹豫、观望。
    最后，我们在这里表明我们的态度。解放以来，我们技术人员在党的领导下，兢兢业业，从事社会主义建设。而一些右派分子却利用党整风机会，进行颠覆活动，这是我们不能容忍的。我们坚决同他们划清界限，进行尖锐斗争。同时，在这个斗争中，进一步提高我们自己的政治思想水平，紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，为进一步发展船舶工业，贡献出我们的一切力量。
    以上各节，是否有当，请各位批评，指教。
