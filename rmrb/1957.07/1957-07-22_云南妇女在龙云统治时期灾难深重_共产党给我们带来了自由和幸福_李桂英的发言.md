I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report and other reports.

Recently, right-wing elements have been starting fires everywhere, spreading reactionary remarks. We, the women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, like the people of the whole country, are very resentful. Long Yun, who ruled Yunnan for eighteen years, has consistently been anti-Soviet, anti-Party, and anti-socialist. Recently, he thought "the time had come" and openly came to our ethnic minority areas to find a market and carry out his conspiracy activities. I am a woman of the Yi ethnic group in Yunnan and have a responsibility to represent the women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan in denouncing Long Yun's heinous crimes here.

As you may have heard, Yunnan under the Kuomintang-Long Yun rule had particularly heavy land rents, usurious loans, and countless exorbitant taxes and levies. Although women of all ethnic groups, along with men, worked diligently throughout the year, "one's heart aches when pounding rice, and tears flow when pounding rice." The grain earned from a year of hard work was emptied by the exploiters. As a result, "even a clever wife cannot cook without rice." The mistress of the house had to look for "wild vegetables and mountain herbs for thousands of families," shedding tears as she watched her hungry and freezing parents-in-law and children. There were also "Chiang's" troops and Long's troops, batch after batch of soldiers being conscripted, and spring famines and autumn famines, year after year of disasters. The poison of the "Opium Kingdom" could also lead to ruin. The reactionary ruling class would impose a crime on you and "confiscate your property and exterminate your family." As a result, you had to sell your sons and daughters, wives and children were separated, and you had to endure the pain of separation.

The Local Emperor Created Countless "White-Haired Girls"

Under the Kuomintang-Long Yun rule, women of all ethnic groups also suffered countless persecutions and humiliations. The troops and officials sent by Long Yun to conquer the ethnic minorities, on the pretext of "suppressing bandits," "quelling rebellions," and "eradicating opium," burned, killed, robbed, and raped women before killing them. The "Third Young Master Long" was notorious for his debauchery, murder, and arson. Countless women were kidnapped, raped, and persecuted by him, relying on his power. The local emperors and feudal ruling classes created countless "White-Haired Girls" who had no place to complain. The practice of raising child brides, forced marriages, arranged marriages, and even "bride snatching" and "wife grabbing" became a fashion in accordance with the "feudal royal law," and many women lost their lives as a result.

At that time, women had no status in society. Except for a few ruling class "female tigers" like "Aunt Long," working women had no rights. Not to mention "studying to become an official" or participating in politics, even saying a word or two in the village would be slandered as "the hen crowing instead of the rooster," regarded as inauspicious and lawless, and condemned. Even wearing their own ethnic costumes and holding ethnic youth festivals would be banned by the "Customs Reform Committee." The superintendent of Malipo and his patrol team used large sickles to tear women's skirts, cut women's braids, and suppress the singing and dancing of young men and women with weapons. Some ethnic minorities in Yunnan lived in high-altitude cold mountainous areas, while others lived in hot and miasmic areas. There were many endemic diseases, and coupled with poverty and backwardness, there were no sanitary conditions. Many pregnant women, new mothers, and infants suffered from diseases and had high mortality rates. Zhang Chen of Penglai Township, Yiliang, had eleven children, all of whom died before the age of one. However, Long Yun preferred to put the people's blood and sweat in his pocket and become a big depositor in the United States. He preferred to waste money and resources on building his "mansion," "villa," and ponds and gardens, completely ignoring the life and death of the people. Many ethnic minority women at that time did not know that there was such a thing as medical and health care.

Liberated Women, Trained Women

The women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, soaked in blood and tears, finally got liberated. No matter how angry Long Yun was about the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Yunnan, we had "broken through the dark clouds to see the sun." The shackles of the reactionary ruling class that oppressed us were shattered, and we gained freedom and equal rights in society, and we also had legal protection. Then, the land reform was victoriously completed, the peasants turned over, and women were also fundamentally liberated, eliminating the reactionary classes that oppressed women. No matter how Long Yun shouted that "land reform was messed up" and "counter-revolutionaries were wrongly suppressed," the "big stone slab" pressing on the people's heads was removed, and the unbreakable people's democratic dictatorship had been established in the countryside. Feudal rule could never be restored. Now, most ethnic minority areas have completed socialist transformation, and socialist construction is being carried out throughout the province. We have deeply realized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be socialism, and only by realizing socialism can we truly and thoroughly liberate the people of all ethnic groups, especially the women of all ethnic groups. Because only socialism can fundamentally get rid of poverty and backwardness and achieve unlimited prosperity and development. This belief is based on iron facts and should be openly answered to Long Yun: collectivization is very suitable and very good in our ethnic minority areas, the people's lives are constantly improving, and the masses are very satisfied!

The victory of the two revolutions liberated women and also trained women, practically improving the status of women. In Eshan Yi Autonomous County, Yi women serve as deputy secretaries of the county party committee, deputy county heads, district chiefs, and section chiefs. In Mile Yi Autonomous County, there are 211 women cadres in county and district government offices and 73 women township heads. In other places and among other ethnic groups, a large number of women cadres have been trained to participate in various tasks. A large number of women cooperative directors, production team leaders, and advanced producers have emerged in society. They have become role models for women. With their help, women are no longer "lowering" their heads and "obeying" like slaves. They have become masters of the country and society. The health conditions of women and children have been greatly improved. Not only have general health institutions been increased, but also special maternal and child health institutions have been established. Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has 27 institutions, four of which are specifically for maternal and child health. In addition, every township has a delivery station, and every village has a new-method midwife. Women's health knowledge has also been improved, and the maternal and child mortality rate has been significantly reduced. Many mothers who lost their children in the past said, "If we had been liberated a few years earlier, my children would have been saved." Many women in many areas have participated in literacy campaigns. In Yiliang Wuyi Cooperative, 81 of the 143 households have learned more than 200 characters. In the countryside, you can often see women commune members reading and writing in their spare time. Many women cadres in cooperatives have learned to record work points and production plans. More girls are entering primary school. Who dares to say that "a woman's virtue is to be without talent"? Women say, "We have turned over the most, and we have been liberated the most." That's the truth.

Made the Elderly Younger Too

We are fully aware that the superiority of the socialist system lies in its ability to continuously develop production and, on the basis of production development, continuously improve people's lives. It is precisely because of this that women of all ethnic groups regard collectivization as a guarantee of their complete liberation. In Yiliang Yongxin Cooperative, out of 844 households, due to continuous increases in production, the original 70% who lacked grain were reduced to only 21 households after the cooperative was established. In the past year alone, they bought 540 new cotton quilts. The masses said, "In the past, we ate wild vegetables and mountain herbs for half a year, but this year we are eating white rice with meat." Zhang Zhangshi said, "In the past, ribs hung on ribs, willow hung on willow, and eighteen-year-old girls had no pants to wear. I have lived for seventy-three years, and every year I just had a raincoat as a 'quilt.' I never thought I would be able to cover myself with a new quilt and wear new cotton clothes now." She felt that collectivization under the leadership of the Communist Party made the elderly younger too.

Because collectivization developed production and improved people's lives, a new atmosphere emerged in the countryside, and the role of women on the production front became more important. Women's enthusiasm for production also increased. Almost all cooperatives have women participating in cooperative affairs management and production management. In Yongxin Cooperative, the attendance rate of women's full labor force reached 97% of the standard requirements. In Lufeng County's water conservancy project with 180,000 workers, 100,000 were women, and a total of 500 small-scale water conservancy projects were built. In Yuxi Prefecture, 8,272 women learned to use threshing machines, and 13,646 learned to use double-wheeled plows. Women in Haiba Township, Fuyuan County, created a high-temperature steaming fertilization method. The women's director of Heping Cooperative in Jinping County took the lead in organizing women to collect 400,000 catties of fertilizer, changing the original habit of not accumulating fertilizer. Because many cooperatives have solved the problems of equal pay for equal work, reasonable arrangement of farm work, sideline occupations, and housework, and taking care of women's characteristics, women's enthusiasm has been continuously developed.

Overthrow the Tigers and Wolves, Eradicate the Poisonous Weeds

The women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan and the people of all ethnic groups are now launching a movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year with full confidence, working with one heart and one mind for a better tomorrow. Everyone is convinced that under the leadership of the Party, advancing along the road of socialism will lead to an increasingly brighter future!

However, delegates, there are still right-wing elements who are irreconcilable with the people. The more we rejoice, the more they hate; the more enthusiastically we work, the more frantic they become. The already dead classes still want to borrow a corpse to return their soul and struggle to the death. They are tigers and wolves who are used to eating sheep, poisonous snakes with protective coloring, and cunning careerists!

Do they still want us to return to the rule of the Kuomintang-Long Yun? Do they still want us to return to the bloody slaughterhouse to wait for death? Do they want us to throw away the fruits of victory and suffer again? I want to solemnly warn the right-wing careerists on behalf of the women of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, no, absolutely not!

Delegates, a finger cannot block the sky, and a loach cannot stir the Yangtze River. A few right-wing elements cannot violate the will of 600 million people. Let us unite, raise our hoes and sickles, clench our fists, and work together to overthrow the tigers and wolves, eradicate the poisonous weeds. Those ambitious elements who talk nonsense and act recklessly must be given the sanctions they deserve!

### 云南妇女在龙云统治时期灾难深重  共产党给我们带来了自由和幸福  李桂英的发言

    云南妇女在龙云统治时期灾难深重
    共产党给我们带来了自由和幸福
    李桂英的发言
    我衷心拥护周总理的报告以及其他的报告。
    最近右派分子到处点火，散布反动言论，我们云南各族妇女和全国人民一样，非常愤恨。曾经统治云南十八年的龙云，一贯反苏、反党、反社会主义，最近一段时期，他以为“时机到了”，公然来我们少数民族中间寻找市场，进行阴谋活动。我是一个云南彝族妇女，有责任代表云南各族妇女在这里控诉龙云的滔天罪行。
    大家也许听说过了，国民党——龙云统治下的云南，有特别苛重的地租高利贷，还有数不清的苛捐杂派。各族妇女虽然跟男子一道，常年辛勤地劳动，但是“不掼谷子心不酸，一掼谷子泪汪汪”，一年血汗换来的粮食，被剥削者搜刮得空空，结果是“巧媳妇难为无米之炊”，当家媳妇只得去找“山茅野菜千家饭”，望着挨饥受冻的公婆儿女掉眼泪，还有“蒋家”军队又龙家军队，一批又一批的抓兵，还有春荒又秋荒，一年又一年的灾荒；“鸦片王国”的毒害，还会使人倾家荡产；反动统治阶级给你安个罪名就“抄家灭门”；结果就要卖儿卖女，妻离子散，忍受着那骨肉分离的苦痛。
    土皇帝不知制造了多少“白毛女”
    在国民党——龙云统治下，各族妇女还受了说也说不完的迫害和凌辱。龙云派来征服少数民族的军队和官吏，借口“剿匪”，“平乱”，“铲烟”，来了就烧杀抢掳，抓住妇女就奸淫，而后杀害；“龙三公子”就是从荒淫无耻、杀人放火而臭名远扬的，被他仗着权势绑去强奸迫害的，不知有多少；土皇帝及封建统治阶级，不知制造了多少有苦无处诉的“白毛女”；蓄童养媳，强迫婚姻，买卖婚姻，乃至“抢婚”“劫妻”，成了合乎“封建王法”的风气，多少妇女因此而丧失了生命。
    在当时，妇女在社会上没有任何地位，除了“龙姑太”等少数统治阶级的“母老虎”外，劳动妇女是没有任何权利的。莫说“读书做官”，与闻政事，就是在村寨里说一两句话，也要诬蔑为“公鸡不叫母鸡叫”，当着不吉不利，无法无天而遭到斥责；甚至穿自己的民族服装，举办民族青年的节日，都要受到“风俗改良委员会”的取缔，麻粟坡督办及其巡缉队，就是用大镰刀撕破妇女的裙子，割妇女的辫子，武装弹压男女青年的歌舞；云南少数民族有的在高寒山区，有的在炎热瘴区，地方病很多，加上穷困落后，没有任何卫生条件，孕妇、产妇、婴儿的疾病很多，死亡率很大，宜良蓬莱乡张陈氏生了十一个孩子都在不满一岁的时候就死了，但是龙云宁可拿人民的血汗装腰包，去当美国的存款大老板，宁可劳民伤财，大修特修他的“公馆”，“别墅”和池沼园林，根本就不管人民的死活，许多少数民族妇女，在当时就不知道天下有一种医疗卫生。
    解放了妇女　锻炼了妇女
    泡在云南血泪里的云南各族妇女，好容易得到了解放，不管龙云怎样恼恨解放军进入云南，反正我们是“冲开乌云见太阳”了，反动统治阶级压迫我们的枷锁敲碎了，我们获得了自由和社会上的平等权利，而且有了法律的保障，接着土地改革胜利完成了，农民翻了身，妇女也从根本意义上得到了解放，把压迫妇女的反动阶级消灭了。不管龙云怎么叫喊“土改搞糟了”“镇反搞错了”，反正压在人民头上的“大石板”掀掉了，农村已建立了牢不可破的人民民主专政，封建统治是万万复辟不了的。现在大部分少数民族地区，已经完成了社会主义改造，全省范围内进行着社会主义建设，我们已经深刻体会到：只有共产党领导，才有社会主义，只有实现社会主义，才能真正地彻底地解放各族人民，特别是解放各族妇女。因为只有社会主义才能从根本上摆脱贫困和落后，才能无限量的富裕和发展。这个信念有铁的事实根据，应该公开回答给龙云：合作化在我们少数民族地区适合得很，好的很，人民的生活在不断地得到了提高，群众满意的很！
    两个革命的胜利，解放了妇女，也锻炼了妇女，从实际上提高了妇女的地位，峨山彝族自治县有彝族妇女担任县委副书记、副县长、区长、科长；弥勒彝族自治县，有县区机关妇女干部二百一十一人，女乡长七十三人。在其他地方，其他民族中，都培养了大批妇女干部参加各项工作，在社会上涌现了大量的女合作社社长、生产队长、先进生产者，她们成了妇女的表率，在她们的帮助下，妇女再不是“低”头“顺”耳的奴才相了，她们成了国家和社会的主人。妇女儿童的卫生条件，大大改善了，不但增加了一般卫生机构，还设立了专门的妇幼保健机构，西双版纳傣族自治州有二十七个机构，其中有四个是专门属于妇幼的，此外，每乡都有接生站，村村都有新法接生员，妇女的卫生常识也提高了，妇幼死亡率显著减少了，许多过去死了孩子的母亲，都说：“早解放几年就好了，那么我的小孩也会保住了。”许多地区的妇女参加了扫盲学习，宜良五一社一百四十三户中，就有八十一个妇女学会了二百个以上的生字，在农村里可以常常看到女社员在工余读书写字，许多合作社的女干部已经学会了记工分，记生产计划。进小学的女孩子也多了，谁还敢说“女子无才便是德”呢？妇女们说：“翻身翻得最大的是我们，解放得最多的是我们。”说实在话。
    使老年人也变年青了
    我们完全清楚，社会主义制度的优越，在于它能够不断发展生产，并在生产发展的基础上，不断改善人民生活。也正因为这一点，各族妇女才把合作化当作彻底解放自己的保证。宜良永新社，八百四十四户，由于连年增产，原来占百分之七十缺粮的，办社后，只有二十一户了，去年一年内就买了新棉被五百四十床。群众说：“过去山茅野菜半年粮，今年白米饭上加块肉。”张张氏说：“过去肋挂肋，柳挂柳，十八岁的大姑娘没裤子穿，我活了七十三岁，年年就是蓑衣‘处嘴被’，想不到现在倒还盖上了新被子穿上了新棉衣。”她感到共产党领导的合作化，使老年人也变年青了。
    正因为合作化发展了生产，改善了生活，农村呈现了一片新气象，妇女在生产战线上的作用显得重要了，妇女的生产积极性也提高了，差不多所有的社，都有妇女参加社务管理和生产管理，永新社女全劳动力的出勤达标准要求的百分之九十七，?麓县修水利十八万工，其中女工就有十万，一共修五百项小型水利工程。玉溪专区妇女学会用打谷机的有八千二百七十二人，学会用双铧犁的有一万三千六百四十六人；富源县海巴乡的妇女创造了高温蒸肥法；金平县和平社妇女主任带头组织妇女积了四十万斤肥，改变了原来不积肥的习惯。由于许多社都解决了同工同酬，合理安排农活、副业及家务，照顾妇女特点等问题，妇女积极性就不断发挥起来了。
    打倒虎狼　铲除毒草
    云南各族妇女和各族人民，现在正在满怀信心地展开争取今年农业大丰收的运动，万众一心地为了更美好的明天努力着，大家确信不疑：在党的领导下，沿着社会主义的道路前进，就会出现愈来愈美好的光景！
    但是，代表们，现在公然还有与人民水火不相容的右派分子，我们愈欢欣鼓舞，他们愈深恶痛绝；我们愈热火朝天，他们愈丧心病狂。已经死亡的阶级，还想借尸还魂，还想临死挣扎；他们是吃惯了羊的虎狼，他们是带着保护色的毒蛇，他们是诡计多端的野心家！
    难道还要我们回到国民党——龙云的统治下面吗？难道还再要我们回到血淋淋的屠场上等死吗？要叫我们丢开胜利的果实又去受苦受难吗？我要代表云南各民族的妇女，严正警告右派野心分子们，不，绝对不能！
    代表们，指头抵不了天，泥鳅搅不了长江水，少数右派分子违反不了六亿人民的意志，让我们团结起来，举起锄头、镰刀，握紧拳头，一齐动手，打倒虎狼、铲掉毒草，对于那些乱说乱动的野心分子一定要给予他们应得的制裁！
