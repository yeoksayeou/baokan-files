　　Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd, Havana News: The revolutionary movement in Cuba to overthrow the Batista dictatorship is growing daily. Now some upper-class figures and political party leaders are also joining this struggle.
　　Recently, Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban guerrillas who are carrying out armed struggle to overthrow the Batista regime, Chibas, leader of the opposition Cuban People's Party, and Pazos, son of the former General Manager of the National Bank of Cuba, jointly signed a joint statement demanding the dismissal of Batista and the establishment of a Cuban provisional government. The statement said that this is the "only way" to eliminate the Cuban political crisis.
　　The statement also called for the release of political prisoners, the democratization of domestic political life, and the holding of presidential elections. It also opposed foreign interference in Cuba's internal affairs and demanded that the United States stop supplying the Cuban government with arms.
　　The guerrillas led by Castro and the government troops have been fighting for more than seven months. Batista once clamored in early June to "completely eliminate" the guerrillas. However, the military strength and political influence of the guerrillas have continued to expand. It is reported that Castro now intends to occupy Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province, or other important cities, and prepare to establish a revolutionary government in order to unite the patriotic forces opposing the Batista regime around the revolutionary government.
　　The activities of workers, students and people of all strata against the Batista regime are also very active. They use methods such as strikes, sabotage, school strikes, and market strikes to fight Batista. The American "Nation" weekly said: "The resistance movement (against Batista) has swept through every village and every city in Cuba. The rural garrison, the national police, the secret police, and the army are powerless to prevent the explosion of bridges, trains, trucks, and buses, and powerless to prevent the destruction and elimination of Batista supporters' property with explosives."

    古巴人民的革命运动在壮大
    要求驱除巴蒂斯塔成立临时政府
    新华社22日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴国内推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的革命运动正在日益壮大。现在一些上层分子和政党领袖也加入这一斗争。
    最近，为推翻巴蒂斯塔政权而进行武装斗争的古巴游击队领导人菲德利亚·卡斯特罗和反对党古巴人民党领袖契巴斯以及古巴国家银行前总经理的儿子帕索斯共同签署了一项联合声明，要求把巴蒂斯塔革职，成立古巴临时政府。声明说，这是消除古巴政治危机的“唯一办法”。
    声明还要求释放政治犯，国内政治生活民主化和举行总统选举，并且反对外国干涉古巴内政，要求美国停止供应古巴政府军火。
    卡斯特罗领导的游击队和政府军队已经作战了七个多月。巴蒂斯塔在6月初曾经扬言要把游击队“完全消灭”。可是，游击队的军事力量和政治影响却反而不断扩大。有消息说，卡斯特罗现在打算占领奥连特省省城圣地亚哥或者其他重要城市，准备成立革命政府，以便把反对巴蒂斯塔政权的爱国力量团结在革命政府的周围。
    工人、学生和各阶层人民的反对巴蒂斯塔政权的活动也十分活跃，他们用怠工、破坏、罢课、罢市的方法同巴蒂斯塔斗争。美国“民族”周刊说：“抵抗（巴蒂斯塔的）运动已经席卷了古巴的每一个村庄和每一个城市，乡村警备队、国家警察、秘密警察和军队无力去防止桥梁、火车、载重汽车和公共汽车的爆炸，无力去防止用炸药炸毁和消灭巴蒂斯塔拥护者的财产。”（附图片）
