Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 10th entitled "Under the Unbreakable Banner." The editorial begins by stating: Our entire Party and all Soviet people unanimously support the CPSU Central Committee's resolution on the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov. The editorial describes the grassroots Party organization meetings and labor people's congresses held in factories, farms, troops, schools, and government offices in recent days, where the Soviet people supported the Party's Leninist general line, the Party's domestic and foreign policies reflecting the fundamental interests of the people, and condemned the anti-Party group.

The editorial points out that Party organizations at all levels and all Communist Party members have drawn the conclusion from the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it is necessary to further strengthen Party unity, to heighten political vigilance, and to never tolerate deviation from the Party's general line and from the Leninist norms and leadership principles of Party life. The current task is to more fully utilize the combat effectiveness of Party organizations at all levels, strengthen the ties between Party organizations at all levels and the masses, promote democracy within the Party, unfold criticism and self-criticism, and educate our cadres and all Communist Party members with a high sense of responsibility for the Party's cause and an untiring concern for the interests of the people.

The editorial says that our country is currently solving major and complex tasks in communist construction. Under these circumstances, our cadres and Communist Party members should unremittingly and creatively grasp Marxism-Leninism, and be good at using Marxism-Leninism as a guide for practical activities. We should resolutely oppose revisionist tendencies, scholasticism, and manifestations of dogmatism, oppose following old ways and sticking to conventions, and support all new and advanced things that arise from the life and creative initiatives of the millions of working masses.

    社论指出，各级党组织和全体共产党员从苏联共产党中央委员会六月全体会议的决议中得出结论，认为必需进一步加强党的团结，必需提高政治警惕性，绝不能容忍离开党的总路线，离开党内生活的列宁主义准则和领导原则。现在的任务是更充分地发挥各级党组织的战斗力，加强各级党组织同群众的联系，发扬党内的民主，展开批评和自我批评，用对党事业的高度责任感和不倦地关切人民利益的精神来教育我们的干部和全体共产党员。
