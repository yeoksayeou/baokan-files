    Welcome to the Beijing Performance of Puzhou Bangzi Opera
    Cheng Yanqiu
    In April and May of this year, I went to Shanxi to participate in the province's Second Drama Observation and Performance Meeting. I saw more than 100 plays performed by a dozen different opera genres. Indeed, each genre has its own characteristics, and each actor has their own meticulous masterpieces. What I saw and heard was truly dazzling, and it broadened my horizons, allowing us to learn a lot of new knowledge.
    This time, the Puzhou Bangzi troupes of Shanxi Province have gathered outstanding actors from seven troupes to perform in Beijing, bringing more than forty excellent traditional plays to meet with the capital's audience. This is something we should warmly welcome.
    Puzhou Bangzi, in the Shanxi Bangzi system, is one of the oldest genres. It has a rich repertoire and many special performance techniques. It has long enjoyed the reputation of "Flower of Southern Shanxi" in Shanxi Province. In the past hundred years, many famous artists have emerged in Puzhou Bangzi, creating very wonderful performing arts, which laid a solid foundation for its growth. Especially after the national liberation, thanks to the support and cultivation of the Party and the government for Puzhou Bangzi, many famous artists who had been displaced and left the stage for many years regained their stage life, and their superb performing arts met with the vast audience again. Therefore, in recent years, many lost plays of Puzhou Bangzi have successively appeared on the stage, and a large number of young outstanding actors have emerged in various Puzhou Bangzi troupes, which has led to the flourishing development of Puzhou Opera. The famous flower of Southern Shanxi is blooming more luxuriantly.
    I have seen many of the plays they are performing in Beijing this time in Shanxi, such as Mr. Yan Fengchun's "Killing the Courier," "Returning to the Clan," Mr. Yang Hushan's "Gifting a Silk Robe," Xue Gang in "Picking the Seal at Yanghe," Mr. Zhang Qingkui's "Three Family Inn," Mr. Li Xinhai's Huang Tianjian in "Predestined Marriage," Mr. Ren Hexin and other old gentlemen's "Dragon and Phoenix Flag," as well as Wang Xiulan's "Selling Water" (Mei Hu), and "Over the Wall" performed by her and Mr. Xiao Yuelai. From the several plays I have seen, I can see that each actor has mastered different talents. Through their serious and conscientious performance, it can be affirmed that they are responsible for the art of opera. Looking at every move and style of their stage performances, each movement is very focused, and the rhythm is also very clear. Like "Three Family Inn" and "Killing the Courier," which emphasize both singing and acting, the spirit is consistent from beginning to end, without any flaws. In addition, Puzhou Bangzi's various special skills in performance, such as "pheasant feather skills," "wing skills," "hair-whipping skills," and "beard skills," can all be combined with emotions. In my opinion, they are all used very skillfully. At the same time, they are not only closely combined with the plot and the ideological changes of the characters, but also this expression method can more prominently express the subtle and complex psychological activities of the characters. If an actor has not undergone painstaking research and continuous practice, it is impossible to express them.
    I heard that the "Killing the Dog" performed by Wang Xiulan this time was personally taught to her by the late famous artist Mr. Wang Cuncai. The characters in the play will perform many traditional stunts of Puzhou Opera. Unfortunately, I will soon have other tasks and will be going abroad, so I cannot watch all of them, which is a pity. I suggest that our Peking Opera colleagues take the time to watch them several times and exchange experiences with each other. Now I wish Puzhou Bangzi a successful completion of its performance mission in Beijing, so that the art of Puzhou Opera can become even richer and more colorful.

    欢迎蒲州梆子来京演出
    程砚秋
    今年四、五月间，我到山西参加该省第二届戏曲观摩会演，看到了十几个剧种演出的一百多个剧目。的确每个剧种有每个剧种的特点，每位演员有他们不同的精心杰作，所见所听真是琳琅满目，大开眼界，使我们学习到许多新的知识。
    这次山西省蒲州梆子集中了七个剧团的优秀演员来京演出，带来了四十多个优秀的传统剧目与首都观众见面，值得我们热烈的欢迎。
    蒲州梆子，在山西梆子系统中，是一个最古老的剧种，它的剧目丰富，表演上有许多特殊技巧，在山西省早已博得“晋南之花”的称誉。近百年来，蒲州梆子曾出现过许多有名的艺术家，创造出非常精采的表演艺术，给它的成长打下一个深厚的基础。特别在全国解放后，由于党和政府对蒲州梆子的支持与培养，过去颠沛流离脱离舞台多年的许多位名艺人又重新获得了舞台生命，他们的精湛表演艺术，又和广大观众见了面。因此，这几年来，蒲州梆子的许多失传剧目，陆续登上舞台，蒲剧各个剧团中，也涌现出大批的青年优秀演员，使蒲剧得到了欣欣向荣的发展，晋南名花，开得更茂盛起来了。
    他们这次来京演出的剧目，我在山西看过了许多出，像阎逢春先生的“杀驿”，“归宗图”，杨虎山先生的“赠绨袍”，“阳河摘印”的薛刚，张庆奎先生的“三家店”，李心海先生的“意中缘”的黄天监，任合心几位老先生的“龙凤旗”，还有王秀兰的“卖水”（郿鄠），以及她和筱月来先生合演的“墙头马上”等。从我所看到的几出戏中，看出每位演员全掌握了不同的才能，通过他们演出上的严肃、认真，可以肯定他们对戏曲艺术是负责的。再从他们舞台上表演动作的一招一式来看，每个动作都很集中，节奏也很鲜明，像“三家店”，“杀驿”等唱做并重的戏，也是自始至终精神贯串到底，丝毫没有败笔。此外，蒲州梆子表演上的多种特技，如“翎子功”、“翅子功”、“甩发功”、“髯口功”等，全能结合感情，在我看他们全运用得非常巧妙，同时不但与剧情、人物思想变化结合的很严紧，而且这种表现手法，更能突出的表达人物的微妙复杂心理活动，如果一个演员没经过苦心的钻研，不断的练习，是无法能够表现出来的。
    听说这次王秀兰演出的“杀狗”，是已故名艺术家王存才老先生亲自传给她的，剧中人物将表演出蒲剧许多传统的绝技。可惜我最近将有其他任务即将出国，不能全部观摩，倒是一件憾事，我建议我们京剧界的同志们抽暇多观摩几次，彼此交流经验。现在我预祝蒲州梆子来京演出胜利完成任务，使蒲剧的艺术更好的丰富多采起来。
