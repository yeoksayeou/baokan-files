Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhang Jiazhi and Yang Ying comment on the current situation of the anti-rightist struggle in Shanghai: The situation in Shanghai's struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements is undergoing rapid changes. On all fronts where right-wing elements have focused their attacks, such as universities, democratic parties, literary and art circles, the press, the judiciary, and industry and commerce, honest people have launched a comprehensive and powerful counterattack, and more and more people are joining this political struggle. In recent days, units have held thousands of large and small meetings to fight against right-wing elements, with the largest gatherings attended by thousands of people.

This struggle has received a wide response in society, with countless citizens writing or calling newspapers to denounce and expose right-wing elements. Shanghai's five newspapers devote more than half of their pages every day to news about the struggle against right-wing elements in various units and materials from the masses exposing and criticizing right-wing elements. Newspaper circulation has increased by more than 50,000 copies.

As early as May of this year, around the time the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a propaganda work conference, right-wing elements, with Peng Wenying, Chen Renbing, Wang Zaoshi, and Sun Dayu, core members of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance, as their main force, launched attacks on the Party in all areas. They engaged in conspiracies day and night, both inside and outside the meeting. Luo Longji – Pu Xixiu – Wenhui Daily editorial department was one line, and Lu Yi – Gu Zhizhong – Wang Zaoshi was another line. The two lines were interconnected, attempting to seize Shanghai's news front. Right-wing elements also usurped the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, openly putting forward policies contrary to the Party's rectification policy, and conspiring to disrupt the Party's rectification steps. Chen Renbing personally went to the Shanghai Film Studio five times to hold seminars, using all despicable means to incite the masses to oppose the leadership. Wang Zaoshi and Yang Zhaolong attacked the judicial front, falsely accusing our country of emphasizing rule by individuals and neglecting the rule of law, demanding that former Kuomintang judicial personnel "return to the team," attempting to tamper with the judicial line. Xu Jie and others directly ignited fires in universities, attacking the Party's higher education policies, while Sun Dayu adopted rogue tactics, arbitrarily labeling non-Party progressive people and Party members as counter-revolutionaries. However, public anger is difficult to suppress. Before long, this group of right-wing elements who attempted to carry out capitalist restoration had their anti-communist and anti-socialist faces exposed under the just denunciation and exposure of the masses. It turned out that this group were all people with a history of opposing the Communist Party and the people. Some were former Kuomintang county magistrates, some were followers of Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," some had offered advice to U.S. imperialist envoy John Leighton Stuart, and some were the chief prosecutors of the "Special Criminal Court" whose hands were stained with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. And their conspiracies had already begun before liberation.

The exposure of the ugly faces of the bourgeois right-wing elements gave the intellectual circles in Shanghai a most practical education. Some kind-hearted people originally thought that the problem of the right-wing elements was merely an ideological problem, or that they were simply deliberately making sensational statements, trying to show off personally, and did not think that this was a class struggle. Now, more and more of these people have stepped onto the front lines of the anti-rightist struggle. Tan Jiazhen, a professor of Fudan University and a geneticist, said with emotion at many meetings that he had been too bookish in the past and unwilling to interfere in politics, so he did not realize he was being used as political capital. Now, under his leadership, the Fudan University branch of the China Democratic League has played a very good role in the struggle. Biologist Wang Mingqi said that he could not concentrate on scientific research unless this struggle was completely victorious. Some people who previously believed that they had firmly stood on the working-class position proved in this political storm that they had overestimated their past awareness, and they said that they must work hard to train themselves in this struggle. At many anti-rightist struggle meetings in universities, reporters saw many old professors rushing to speak first, mercilessly exposing the reactionary words and deeds of right-wing elements. Many intellectuals eagerly hope to further transform themselves in this struggle.

In the anti-rightist struggle, the Shanghai press also received a profound education. The capitalist ideology existing in the minds of journalists has brought varying degrees of harm to the socialist news media. The editorial staff of Wenhui Daily has held large meetings for days to expose many facts about the Zhang-Luo alliance directing Wenhui Daily to attack the working class. Xinmin Evening News and Xinwen Daily also reviewed their mistakes. The Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "Learn a Lesson from the Mistakes of Wenhui Daily," pointing out that the People's Daily's criticism of Wenhui Daily has great significance for all journalists on how to run a socialist newspaper, how to improve their class awareness, and how to understand the current anti-rightist struggle from this class perspective.

The situation in Shanghai's struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements is still developing. Under the just denunciation of the masses, the right-wing group's formation has already faltered. After Lu Yi, the "military advisor" of the right-wing elements, exposed the group's conspiracy plan in his confession, it caused great shock in the right-wing camp. Some began to express their willingness to confess, some hesitated, expressing a vague acknowledgement of the exposed conspiracies, some made false self-criticisms everywhere, saying things that did not come from the heart, some asked to be hospitalized due to illness, and some right-wing elements were still stubbornly resisting. The angry masses have issued vows more than once: We will never stop fighting until we win complete victory!

### 上海人民全面反击右派集团阵脚动摇

    上海人民全面反击右派集团阵脚动摇
    新华社上海7日电　新华社记者张家炽、杨瑛评述上海目前反右派斗争的形势：上海反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争形势正在起急剧的变化。高等学校、民主党派、文艺界、新闻界、司法界、工商界等被右派分子作为进攻重点的各个战线上，正直的人们已经展开了全面的声势浩大的回击，投入这一政治斗争的人数愈来愈多。连日来各单位举行了千百次反右派分子的大小集会，最大的集会有成千人参加。
    这一斗争在社会上得到了广泛的反响，无数市民写信或打电话给报社声讨和揭露右派分子。上海五家报纸每天有二分之一以上的版面都刊登各单位反右派分子斗争的新闻和来自群众的揭露、批驳右派分子的材料。报纸发行量增长了五万多份。
    早在今年5月，中共上海市委召开宣传工作会议前后，以章伯钧、罗隆基联盟的骨干分子彭文应、陈仁炳、王造时、孙大雨等为主要力量的右派分子，即在各方面发动向党进攻。他们日夜在会场内外进行阴谋活动。罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部是一条线，陆诒——顾执中——王造时是另一条线，两条线一脉连通，企图夺取上海的新闻阵地。右派分子还窃取了民盟上海市委员会的领导权，公然提出和党的整风政策相反的方针，阴谋打乱党的整风步骤。陈仁炳更亲自出马，五次到上海电影制片厂去召开座谈会，用尽一切卑鄙的手段，煽动群众同领导对立。王造时、杨兆龙向司法战线进攻，诬蔑我国重人治，轻法治，要求国民党旧司法人员“归队”，企图篡改司法路线。许杰等直接在高等学校放火，攻击党的高教政策，孙大雨则采取无赖战术，到处给非党进步人士和党员戴反革命帽子。但是众怒难犯，曾几何时，这一批企图进行资本主义复辟的右派分子，在群众的正义声讨和揭露下，反共反社会主义的面目已经暴露无遗。原来这一批都是反共反人民有来历的人物。有的曾是国民党的县太爷，有的是蒋介石所著“中国之命运”的信徒，有的曾向美帝侵华使者司徒雷登献过策，有的还是手沾革命烈士鲜血的“特刑庭”首席检察官。而他们的阴谋活动，早已在解放以前就开始了。
    资产阶级右派分子丑恶面目的暴露，给了上海知识界一次最实际的教育。有些好心肠的人原来以为右派分子仅仅是思想问题，或只是故作惊人之语，贪图个人出风头，而不认为这是一场阶级斗争。现在，这些人已经越来越多地走上反右派斗争的前线。复旦大学教授、遗传学家谈家桢在好多次会上，都感慨地谈到过去书生气太重，不愿过问政治，因此被人当作政治资本还不自知。现在，在他领导下，民盟复旦大学支部已在斗争中发挥了很好的作用。生物学家王鸣岐说，这次斗争不获全胜，他不可能安心去研究科学。有些人过去自认为已站稳了工人阶级立场，但在这次政治斗争风浪中，证明过去对自己的觉悟估计过高了，他们表示一定要在这次斗争中好好锻炼自己。在高等学校多次反右派斗争大会上，记者亲眼看到许多老教授抢在前面发言，他们毫不容情地揭发了右派分子的反动言行。许多知识分子都热切地希望在这场斗争中进一步改造自己。
    在反右派斗争中，上海的新闻界也得到一次深刻的教育。在新闻工作者头脑中存在的资本主义思想意识已给社会主义新闻事业带来了不同程度的危害。文汇报的编辑部工作人员连日举行大会，揭发了许多章罗联盟指挥文汇报向工人阶级进攻的事实。新民报、新闻日报也检讨了自己的错误，解放日报发表了“从文汇报的错误中吸取教训”的社论，指出人民日报对文汇报的批评，对于所有的报人应该如何办好一张社会主义的报纸、如何提高自己的阶级觉悟，从这一阶级观点来认识当前的反右派斗争，都具有重大的意义。
    上海反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争形势还在发展，在群众的正义声讨下，右派集团的阵脚已经有了动摇。右派分子的“军师”陆诒在坦白中暴露了这个集团的阴谋计划后，在右派阵营中引起很大的震动。有的开始表示要交代，有的吞吞吐吐，对揭露的阴谋活动表示似有似无，有的到处作假检讨，言不由衷，有的托病要住医院，也有些右派分子尚在顽抗。愤怒的群众已不止一次发出誓言：不获全胜，决不收兵！
