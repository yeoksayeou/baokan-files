    Sightseeing in the Rose Valley
    Our Correspondent Li Cheng
    About forty kilometers east of Sofia, Mount Kiriliubets is shrouded in a light morning mist. Our car accelerated its climb to the summit. Zhuravsky, the Soviet Pravda correspondent in Bulgaria who was familiar with the area, said excitedly, "We're almost there! After we cross this mountain and then Mount Kosnitsa, we'll be in the famous Rose Valley."
    East of Mount Kosnitsa is a long, narrow strip of land stretching for dozens of kilometers, with the Balkan Mountains running across the north and the Sredna Mountains winding to the south, with the Stremna and Densa Rivers and countless streams flowing through it. The climate here is mild, the rainfall is plentiful, and the soil is fertile, making it an excellent place for roses to grow and multiply. Legend has it that roses began to grow and multiply here in the early 18th century. Every year from the end of May to mid-June, the roses compete in beauty and fragrance, attracting tourists from far and wide.
    The car took us into the intoxicating Rose Valley. The clock pointed to six forty-five.
    Amidst the red and white rose bushes, people were busy picking flowers. Accompanied by the fragrance of flowers, came the songs and laughter of the flower-picking girls. Trucks loaded with roses passed us from time to time, heading to nearby rose oil refineries. Obviously, the flower-picking girls had been working hard for some time. They had to pick all the open roses before the morning dew disappeared. It is said that the flowers picked during this time contain the most oil.
    There are more than 7,000 varieties of roses in the Rose Valley, but only four can be used to extract oil. The main varieties grown here are pink and white oil-bearing roses. There is a story circulating in the Rose Valley: Hundreds of years ago, a beautiful and outstanding noblewoman from Kashmir, India, was often troubled by the lack of fragrance on her body. There was no perfume at that time. She loved the fragrance of roses, and every time she took a bath, she had her servants put a lot of roses in the tub. Once, the roses put in the tub included oil-bearing flowers, and a layer of oil droplets floated on the warm water, and the rich fragrance lasted for a long time. From then on, people discovered oil-bearing roses and began to extract rose oil.
    In the Rose Valley, rose oil factories are built near the rose gardens to extract the oil from the flowers in a timely manner. We visited the Rossino rose oil refinery. The head of the factory's Party organization, Kirov, enthusiastically took us on a tour of the oil refining process. In the refining room, steam filled the air and fragrance permeated everything. Several workers were pouring roses into a two-person-high steaming pot. The technician told us that the basic method of extracting rose oil is steaming and boiling. On average, about 3,000 to 3,100 kilograms of roses are needed to extract one kilogram of rose oil. Currently, Bulgaria's rose oil refineries have both manual and automated operations. Bulgaria is already able to manufacture many of the machines and equipment.
    The Bulgarian Party and government are very concerned about the production of oil-bearing roses. An official from the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture in charge of this production once told reporters: As early as 1915, the working people here cultivated about 90,000 decares of roses. Later, due to the capitalists in the rose oil refineries lowering the purchase price of roses, coupled with the fact that on the eve of World War II, the Bulgarian fascist government, in order to help the German fascists prepare for the war of aggression, ordered farmers to destroy the rose gardens and grow food crops instead, by the time of liberation in 1944, the rose planting area here was only about 10,000 decares. After liberation, the Party and government took various measures to expand the cultivation of roses, such as exempting land planted with roses from the task of selling grain to the state, timely supplying the chemical fertilizers needed for cultivating roses, reducing the price of food supplied to rose growers, rewarding agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers who expanded the area of rose cultivation, and increasing the purchase price of roses. The purchase price of roses is now twice as high as it used to be. These measures have greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers to cultivate roses. The cultivated area of roses has now reached 30,000 decares. In another four or five years, it will be more than doubled, reaching about 62,000 decares.
    99% of the rose oil produced in Bulgaria is sold abroad, which is an important source of national income. In the world market, Bulgaria's rose oil exports account for more than 80%. It is said that one kilogram of rose oil is worth about three kilograms of gold. With the expansion of the rose planting area and the increase in the purchase price, the income of rose growers has also been increasing, and their lives have improved. We visited Rozovets village, which grows the most roses. The chairman of the agricultural production cooperative, Zvidanski, told us very happily: There are about 500 households in this village, with more than 12,000 decares of cultivated land, most of which has now joined the cooperative. In addition to food crops, the cooperative grows a total of 1,600 decares of oil-bearing roses, and the income from roses accounts for almost half of the cooperative's total income. Now, the lives of rose growers have greatly improved, and every household has a radio. The houses of one hundred households have been renovated and look brand new. More than 300 elderly people are enjoying state pensions. ...
    After returning to Sofia, the beautiful and happy Rose Valley left a pleasant impression on our hearts. (Attached photo)

    玫瑰谷见闻
    本报记者　李成
    索非亚东面约四十公里的基里别茨山，浴身在轻盈的晨雾里。我们的汽车加足马力向山顶爬行。熟悉这一带情况的苏联真理报驻保加利亚记者茹拉夫斯基兴奋地说：“快到啦！翻过这座山，再翻过科斯尼查山，就是有名的玫瑰谷了。”
    科斯尼查山的东面是一条绵长数十公里的狭长地带，巴尔干山横亘于北，斯列德那山蜿蜒于南，斯特列玛河和登萨河以及无数小溪穿流其间。这里气候温和，雨水充足，土壤肥沃，是玫瑰花生长繁殖的良好地方。相传十八世纪初，玫瑰花就在这里生长繁殖起来了。每年5月底到6月中旬，玫瑰花争奇斗艳，芳香扑鼻，吸引着远近游客。
    汽车把我们带进了令人陶醉的玫瑰谷。时针指着六点三刻。
    在红白相间的玫瑰丛里，人们正忙着采摘花朵。随着花香，传来了采花姑娘们的歌声笑语。满载玫瑰花的大卡车，不时从我们旁边驶过，开往附近的玫瑰油炼制场。显然，采花姑娘们已经辛勤工作了一段时间了。她们要在清晨露水消逝以前把所有开放的玫瑰花采下。据说，这段时间采下的花含油量最多。
    玫瑰谷的玫瑰花共有七千多种，但是能炼油的只有四种。这里种植的主要是粉红色和白色两种含油玫瑰花。玫瑰谷内流传着这样一个故事：数百年前，印度克什米尔一个娟美出众的贵妇人，常常因她身上没有香味而苦恼。那时还没有香水。她很喜爱玫瑰花的香味，每次洗澡时都让仆人往澡池里放很多玫瑰花。有一次，放入澡池的玫瑰花中有了含油的花，温热的水上漂浮着一层油点，浓郁的香气经久不散。从此，人们就发现了含油玫瑰花，开始炼取玫瑰油。
    在玫瑰谷，炼制玫瑰油的工场就建立在玫瑰园附近，以便及时提取花内的油分。我们访问了罗西诺玫瑰油炼制场。工场党组织负责人基洛夫热情地带我们参观了炼油过程。炼油间里，蒸气弥漫，香风四溢，几个工人正在把玫瑰花倒到两人来高的蒸锅里。技术员告诉我们，提炼玫瑰油的基本方法就是蒸和煮。平均约三千到三千一百公斤玫瑰花才能炼出一公斤玫瑰油。现在，保加利亚的玫瑰油炼制场，有人工操作的，也有自动化的。不少机器设备，保加利亚已能制造。
    保加利亚党和政府很关心含油玫瑰的生产。保加利亚农业部一位负责这项生产的同志曾对记者说：早在1915年，这里的劳动人民曾培植了约九万狄卡尔玫瑰。后来，由于玫瑰油炼制场资本家压价收购玫瑰花，加以第二次世界大战前夕，保加利亚法西斯政府为了帮助德国法西斯准备侵略战争，曾命令农民毁掉玫瑰园，改种粮食作物，到1944年解放前夕，这里的玫瑰种植面积只剩下一万狄卡尔左右了。解放后，党和政府采取了各种措施扩大培植玫瑰花的面积，如免除种植玫瑰的耕地向国家交售粮食的任务，及时供应培植玫瑰所需的化学肥料，减价供给玫瑰种植者以食粮，奖励扩大玫瑰培种面积的农业生产合作社和个体农民，提高玫瑰花收购价格等。现在玫瑰花的收购价格比过去提高了两倍。这些措施，大大提高了农民培植玫瑰的积极性。现在栽培玫瑰的耕地面积已达三万狄卡尔。再过四、五年将比现在扩大一倍多，达到六万二千狄卡尔左右。
    保加利亚生产的玫瑰油，99％运销国外，是一项重要的国民收入。在世界市场上，保加利亚玫瑰油的输出量占80％以上。据说，一公斤玫瑰油的价值相当于三公斤左右黄金。随着玫瑰种植面积的扩大和收购价格的提高，玫瑰培植者的收入也不断增加，生活得到了改善。我们访问了栽种玫瑰最多的罗佐维兹村。农业生产合作社主席兹维丹斯基非常愉快地对我们说：这个村子共有五百来户人家，一万二千多狄卡尔耕地，现今绝大部分已加入了合作社。除了粮食作物外，合作社共种了一千六百狄卡尔含油玫瑰，玫瑰花的收入几乎占合作社全部收入的一半。现在，玫瑰种植者的生活已大有改善，家家户户都有了收音机。一百来户的住房翻修得焕然一新。三百多个老人享受着国家的养老金。……
    回到索非亚以后，美丽、幸福的玫瑰谷给我们的愉快印象，一直留在我们的心中。（附图片）
