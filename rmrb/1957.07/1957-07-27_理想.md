    Ideals
    By Our Staff Reporter Jin Feng
    What are his ideals?
    In the summer of 1954, out of 371 graduating students from the Changli County No. 2 Middle School, 370 went on to further education or employment, leaving only one student to return to his hometown—this was Long Wanshun, the secretary of the school's Youth League branch, who could not participate in the entrance examinations for further education or employment due to illness.
    However, Long Wanshun did not return to the countryside with a feeling of grievance or depression.
    A page from his diary is his witness:
    "July 1, 1954... Our predecessors shed their blood on the land where our ancestors toiled, reclaiming and defending our land for us... We should inherit the cause of our fathers and brothers. We will make something that has not existed for thousands of years appear today—we will use our own labor, our own labor, to transform this backward place into something new."
    This was the oath Long Wanshun made to the Party on the Party's birthday, on the eve of the graduation examinations, and it was also his ideal. At that time, the eyes of the vast majority of his classmates were set on the large and medium-sized cities. But his, the son of a poor peasant, his heart turned to the yellow earth plains where he was born, the low, old mud houses, and the green fields of crops.
    Long Wanshun's ideal grew out of his class background and the Party's education. His grandfather died of poverty in Guandong, and his father worked as a hired hand all his life. Long Wanshun had to beg for food when he was six years old. At that time, his father was ill, and his mother had just given birth to his younger brother and was also sick in bed, having not eaten a bite of food for days. When little Long Wanshun held half a ladle of burnt and blackened sorghum paste, rushing to his mother's bedside, calling out happily, "Mom, this time we have something to eat!" his mother hugged his neck and cried out, "Begging for food at such a young age, what will become of you in the future!" He would never forget that scene. After the liberation, his father, who was given land, always told him not to forget his roots. He cared about and sympathized with the fate of people of his class. He saw that some poor households in the village still could not withstand the blows of natural disasters and human misfortunes, and some people had been mortgaging their houses and selling their land in recent years. He was anxious and worried. After entering school, he received the education of the Party and the League, and he knew the heroic history of the Chinese people's liberation cause. He yearned for the Red Army soldiers who advanced in the torrents of the Dadu River, he yearned for the anti-Japanese guerrillas who emerged from the green gauze tents to strike at the Japanese imperialists, and he also yearned for the Volunteer Army heroes who persisted in fighting the American aggressors in the tunnels of Shangganling. But, isn't changing the face of the motherland, so that the uncles and aunts who mortgage their houses and sell their land will never shed tears again, so that young men and women will all laugh, so that the happy life of Soviet collective farms will appear on the land of China, isn't this a heroic and grand cause? Let tractors sing in the fields, orchards appear everywhere in the barren mountain villages, flat highways are laid in the mountain gullies, electric lights illuminate the classrooms of children, this is also a world-shaking and great undertaking! Long Wanshun often thought: Our predecessors shed blood and sweat to overthrow the two great mountains of imperialism and feudalism, so we should not be afraid of hardship to overthrow the two great mountains of poverty and backwardness! He was determined to dedicate his life to the cause of rural transformation.
    However, at that time he was not very clear about the specific path to realizing his ideals. He also had some concerns about the peasants. Looking at the countryside with the eyes of the past, he always felt that the peasants were backward and scattered, and it was not easy for everyone to be of one mind. Their village had only eight poor peasant households running an agricultural cooperative before, and he often heard the peasants talking about it with an air of distrust.
    But what a scene he saw when he returned to his hometown! The agricultural cooperative run by eight poor peasant households had a bumper harvest, with yields 50 to 100 percent higher than those of ordinary households. The whole village was like a boiling pot, with every household discussing joining the cooperative. His father had already filled out an application form. The original agricultural cooperative expanded from eight households to sixty-eight households, and two new cooperatives were also established. Eighty or ninety percent of the farmers in the village wanted to take the road of collectivization.
    Long Wanshun's eyes lit up, and he saw the specific path to realizing his ideals. He forgot his illness and immediately threw himself into the work of collectivization. He helped the old cooperative settle accounts and compile statistical tables. He also ran from house to house, visiting, collecting opinions, and organizing farmers to discuss the articles of association and plans of the new cooperative. The Party branch secretary also formally talked to him, asking him to stay and help run the cooperative. They often discussed future plans under the kerosene lamp—unifying all the labor force in the village, connecting the fields into one piece, opening machine wells, applying more fertilizer, turning dry land into paddy fields, opening orchards and vineyards, tractors plowing the land... Several higher primary school graduates also stayed with Long Wanshun.
    At this time, the Education Section of the Funing County Government sent a notice asking him to become an elementary school teacher. But Long Wanshun had already decided to stay in the countryside. The first thing he asked when he arrived at the Education Section was, "Is it okay if I don't go?" He explained that he wanted to stay and participate in agricultural construction. The comrades in the Education Section praised his aspirations and encouraged him to stay in the countryside with peace of mind.

    Honestly and Steadfastly, Become a Peasant

    Long Wanshun knew that to transform the countryside, he had to be familiar with agricultural labor and integrate with the peasants. Therefore, although the cooperative wanted him to be an accountant, he declined. He wanted to honestly and steadfastly learn production and become a true farmer.
    Long Wanshun went to the fields to produce, and the masses looked at him with a special gaze, and there was always a constant whispering behind his back: "Who would have thought that such a smart and clever child would be so muddle-headed. There's no future in farming, all that studying was for nothing!" "Looks like he's destined to turn over dirt clods, can't expect him to amount to much!" Long Wanshun was mentally prepared for this. He still smiled and, along with several higher primary school graduates, was assigned to the production team, working with everyone.
    It was not easy to train in labor. Although Long Wanshun came from a farming family, he had only done some simple light work since he was a child. If he really wanted to be a farmer, he had to start from scratch. One day he and several young people went to the field to help the old cooperative pull cotton stalks for free. This was a strenuous task. The cotton stalks grew tall and thick, and everyone else bent over to pull them. Long Wanshun didn't know how to start, so he found the old farmer Yang Laohong: "Uncle, I'll pull with you!" Yang Laohong straightened his back, took a look at him, and said with a smile, "Pulling this requires real strength, if you pull falsely, you won't be able to pull it up. Grab it firmly with your hands and it will come down with a pull. If your hands are loose, you'll tear your skin." Long Wanshun agreed and started pulling. After pulling half a ridge, he felt his mouth dry and his tongue bitter, and he had no strength in his body. At that time, the ground was already frozen, but the sweat on his head was dripping down. He couldn't help but say to Yang Laohong, "Uncle, I can't do it, I can't hold on." Yang Laohong had been watching him for a long time, and at this time he said slowly, "Farming requires patience. If you can't train yourself the first time, you'll never have the guts!" Long Wanshun heard that this was right. No matter how tiring the work, you can't train yourself without doing it. He calmed down, bent over, and after pulling one ridge, he looked at his hands and saw that he had several blisters. He didn't say anything and kept working with everyone until dark.
    In this way, he gradually trained himself consciously. He was not afraid of tiredness, hardship, or dirt when working, and he did not care about the lightness, importance, or value of the work, or how many work points he earned. In the spring, he pulled a heavy stone roller in the field. The newly turned soil was loose and soft, and the stone roller became heavier and heavier as he pulled it. He was so dizzy from exhaustion, but he still persisted. In the summer, the manure smelled disgusting, and no one wanted to collect it. He and several young people took out the manure from each household's outhouse, and then concentrated it and mixed it with sand. From books he saw that urine fertilizer had a great effect, but the masses did not have the habit of collecting urine fertilizer. He first found Grandma Er, who lived opposite his house, and said to her, "Don't pour out the urine jar tomorrow, leave it for us..." Before he finished speaking, Grandma Er said strangely and amusedly, "What nonsense are you talking about, you young student? What do you want me to leave the urine jar for?" After several explanations, she still didn't believe him, and because he was in a hurry to notify each household, he had to say, "You're a grandmother, let me show you some respect, okay? I'll leave the urine jar and I'll pour it for you." Later, he organized several League members and went with him to pour urine jars from house to house. People joked with him, "It's still the middle school student who's promising, coming to pour urine jars for people." He also jokingly replied, "Consider yourselves lucky, a middle school student is pouring urine jars for you." When plowing the land, someone was needed to pull the livestock. This was a relatively simple agricultural task, and the work points were calculated less. In the past, it was done by children. Now that the children were all in school, it was impossible to find someone to pull the livestock. Long Wanshun volunteered to pull the livestock. While resting at the end of the field, someone poked fun at him again: "Wanshun, it's a pity, with your education as a middle school student, going home to pull livestock, why don't you go to the Public Security Bureau?" It turned out that the Public Security Bureau had come to recruit cadres the day before and had asked the cooperative director for him. Long Wanshun had already refused to go, and at this time he said with a smile, "If everyone goes to the Public Security Bureau, who will pull the livestock?"

    Ideals Initially Realized

    While learning production, Long Wanshun thought about using his knowledge to help production. In the spring of 1955, it was dry and the cotton seeds were difficult to sprout. He saw in the agricultural technology newsletter that soaking cotton seeds could make them sprout earlier. With the support of the cooperative director, he and several young people started soaking the seeds. When the masses touched the water, it was scalding hot, and they all said that the cotton seeds would be burned. Some people even said, "If this can sprout, I'll dig out my eyeballs and stomp them into smithereens!" Long Wanshun was really worried. If the ground was so dry, and the seeds didn't sprout, they would say that he had ruined the seeds. He went to the fields several times a day to see how they were doing. Some old farmers also cared a lot and went to see how they were doing. To everyone's delight, the cotton seeds sprouted in three or four days, and the tender buds emerged from the soil in five or six days. Everyone was surprised and said, "Normally, the seeds wouldn't sprout in twelve or thirteen days even if the ground wasn't dry. I've never seen them sprout so quickly. These young people are really capable! It seems that farming also requires knowledge and studying."
    In the spring of 1956, the six villages in Long Wanshun's hometown united to form an advanced cooperative with 1,114 households and 14,000 mu of land. The masses trusted Long Wanshun and elected him as the technical section chief of the large cooperative. The cooperative sent him to Tangshan to learn how to operate a boiler-tractor, and after returning, he organized a training class for boiler-tractor operators with nine people. He also started a technical spare-time school, with more than 300 agricultural cooperative cadres and farmers participating. He explained some technical measures needed for agricultural work at that time. He also learned well drilling techniques and led the young people in the village to drill a well.
    In the autumn, the tractor station was established. Four tractors roared into the cultivated land of the agricultural cooperative, plowing more than 10,000 mu of land. Just two years earlier, the land here was still divided into small pieces, and only the dozens of mu of land of eight poor peasant households were connected together like isolated islands in the sea. The seven-inch plow was still a rare advanced agricultural tool at that time. Now, tens of thousands of mu of land are connected into one piece, and tractors are roaring in the fields. The water from the machine well irrigates the paddy fields, ready to be drained, and the grape vines are being covered. Long Wanshun saw that the dreams of two years ago had become a reality, and the road ahead would become wider and wider!

    理想
    本报记者　金凤
    什么是他的理想？
    1954年的夏天，昌黎县二中毕业班三百七十一个学生有三百七十个都升学、就业去了，只有一个学生回到自己的家乡——这就是学校青年团的总支委员、因病不能参加升学和就业考试的龙万顺。
    但是，龙万顺并不是带着委屈苦闷的心情到农村去的。
    一叶日记是他的见证：
    “1954年7月1日……我们的先辈在我们祖先劳动的土地上为我们流尽了鲜血，给我们夺回并且保卫了我们的土地……我们应当继承父兄们的事业。几千年所没有的事我们今天让它出现——把这个落后的地方用我们自己的劳动、自己的劳动来改变成新的样子。”
    这是在毕业考试前夕，龙万顺在党的生日向党作的誓言，也是他的理想。那时候，绝大多数同班同学的眼光都投向大、中城市。而他，这个贫农的儿子，他的心却转向那出生他的黄土平原，那低矮陈旧的土房和绿油油的庄稼地上。
    龙万顺的理想，是从他的阶级出身和党的教育培育起来的。他爷爷穷死在关东，他父亲当了一辈子长工。龙万顺六岁的时候要过饭。那时他父亲有病，他母亲刚刚生了小弟弟，也病倒在炕上，几天没有进一口粮食。当小小的龙万顺捧着半瓢又焦又黑的高粱糊锅巴，奔到母亲炕前，满心喜欢地叫着：“妈，这回可有得吃的了！”他母亲一把搂住他的脖子，大哭起来：“这小小年纪就讨吃，将来如何得了呵！”这情景，他是一辈子也忘不了的。解放以后分到田地的父亲，也总是嘱咐他不要忘本。他关心和同情同阶级人的命运。他看到村里的一些贫困户还是抗不住天灾人祸的打击，这几年总有人典房卖地。他焦急，他发愁。进了学校，他接受了党团的教育，他知道中国人民解放事业的英勇历史。他向往那在大渡河急流中前进的红军勇士，他向往那出没在青纱帐打击日本帝国主义的抗日游击队员，他也向往那坚持在上甘岭坑道抗击美国强盗的志愿军英雄。但是，难道改变祖国大地的面貌，使典房卖地的伯伯叔叔们永远不再流眼泪，使青年男女个个欢笑，使苏联集体农庄的幸福生活出现在中国大地上，这不是英雄豪迈的事业？让拖拉机在田野歌唱，贫瘠的山庄到处出现果园，平坦的大马路在山沟里铺起来，电灯照亮孩子们的课堂，这也是翻天覆地的伟大事业！龙万顺常常这样想：我们的前辈流血流汗推倒了帝国主义和封建主义两座大山，我们就应当不怕艰苦，来推翻贫穷和落后这两座大山！他立志将自己的一生献给农村的改造事业。
    但是，那时候他还不大清楚实现理想的具体道路。他对于农民也还有些顾虑。用过去的眼光打量农村，他总觉得农民落后、分散，大伙不易齐心。他们村里以前只有八户贫农办了一个农业社，他就常常听到农民们用不信任的口气谈论它。
    但是，回到家乡，他看到的是怎样一副情景呵！八户贫农办的农业社丰收了，产量比一般农户高百分之五十到一百。全村像开了锅一样，家家户户都在讨论着入社。他的父亲早已填了申请书。原来的农业社由八户扩大到六十八户，还建立了两个新社。村里百分之八九十以上的农民要走合作化的道路。
    龙万顺的眼睛亮起来了，他看到了实现他的理想的具体道路。他忘了自己的病，立即投身到合作化的工作中去。他帮助老社结算帐目，统计表格。他又一家家去奔跑，访问，收集意见，组织农民讨论新社的章程和计划。党支部书记也正式和他谈话，要他留下来帮助办社。他们常常在煤油灯下讨论着未来的计划——全村劳力统一组织起来，田地连成一片，开机井，多施肥，变旱田为水田，开辟果木园和葡萄园，拖拉机翻耕土地……几个高小毕业生也和龙万顺一起留了下来。
    这时候，抚宁县政府教育科来了一个通知，要他去当小学教员。但是龙万顺已经决定留在农村了。他到教育科以后第一句话就问：“我不去行不行？”他说明他想留下来参加农业建设。教育科的同志称赞他的志愿，鼓励他安心留在农村。
    老老实实，当个农民
    龙万顺知道，要改造农村，就得熟悉农业劳动，和农民打成一片。因此，社里虽然让他当会计，他回绝了。他想老老实实，学会生产，做个真正的庄稼人。
    龙万顺下地生产了，群众都用一种特殊的眼光打量他，在他背后总不断有嘁嘁喳喳议论他的声音：“想不到这么个聪明伶俐孩子，心眼这么糊涂。种庄稼有啥出息，念的书都白念了！”“想来是翻土疙瘩的命，不能指望有多大出息！”对于这些，龙万顺早有思想准备。他还是笑嘻嘻的，和几个高小毕业生一起，编在生产队里，随着大伙一起劳动。
    在劳动中锻炼，也不是容易的事儿。龙万顺虽说是庄稼家庭出身，从小也只干过一些简单的轻活。真要当个庄稼人，还得从头学起。那一天他和几个青年一起到地里帮老社义务拔棉花秸。这是个费劲活儿。棉花秸长得又高又粗，别人都弯腰去拔了，龙万顺不知道怎样下手，就找到老农杨老洪：“大伯，我跟你拔！”杨老洪直起腰，一看是他，笑笑说：“拔这要使真劲，拉假，可拔不了。用手抓结实了，一拔就下来。手一稀松，肉皮子都会拉破。”龙万顺答应着，便跟着拔开了。拔了半垅，他就觉得口干舌苦，身上一点劲都没有。那时地已上冻，他头上的汗却一滴滴直掉下来。他忍不住和杨老洪说：“大伯，不中了，我顶不住了。”杨老洪早就看在眼里，这时便慢条斯理地说：“干庄稼活，得有耐心。头回炼不出来，以后就更没有胆啦！”龙万顺一听，这话说得对。多累的活，不干炼不出来。他沉住气弯下腰去，拔完一垅，到地头上一看，手上起了好几个血泡。他没有吭声，跟着大伙一直干到天黑。
    就这样，他一点点有意识地锻炼起来。他干活不怕累、不怕苦、不怕脏，不计较活的轻重贵贱，工分多少。春天，他拉着沉重的石滚在田里压过。新翻的土又松又软，石滚愈拉愈沉，他累得头昏脑胀，还是坚持下来。夏天，大粪熏得人恶心，没有人愿意去起大粪。他和几个青年，从一家家茅房掏出粪来，再集中起来和上沙子。从书本上他看到尿肥作用很大，但是群众没有积尿肥的习惯。他就先找了对门的二奶奶，对她说：“明天的尿罐别泼，给我们留着……”话还没有说完，二奶奶又奇怪又好笑的说，“你这洋学生胡说什么，把尿罐给你留着干什么？”经过几次解释，她还不信，他因为急着到各家通知，就只好说：“你是当奶奶的，我孝敬孝敬你还不行，留着尿罐我给你倒吧。”以后，他组织几个团员和他一块一家家去倒尿罐。人家和他开玩笑：“还是中学生有出息，给人倒尿罐来了。”他也开着玩笑回答：“算你们有福，中学生给你们倒尿罐来了。”犁地的时候要人拉牲口，这是比较简单的农活，工分算得少，过去都是孩子干的。现在孩子都上学了，找不到人拉。龙万顺自告奋勇去拉牲口。在地头休息时，又有人刺他：“万顺，可惜点儿，凭你一个中学生，回家拉牲口，为啥不到公安局去？”原来前一天公安局来招收干部，和社主任提出要他。龙万顺已经回绝不去，这时笑着说，“都上公安局去，谁来拉牲口？”
    理想初步实现了
    龙万顺一面学习生产，一面想着要把自己这点文化知识用到生产上去。1955年春天，天旱地干，棉花不易出芽。他在农业技术通讯上看到棉花浸种，可以早发芽。得到社主任的支持，他就和几个青年一起动手浸种。群众一摸水都烫手，都说要把棉籽烫坏了。还有人说：“这要能出芽，我把眼珠挖出来踩个炮！”龙万顺也真担心，地这么干，万一出不了芽，还说是把种籽浸坏了。他一天要到地头看几遍。一些老农也挺关心，都去看看到底出的咋样。真叫人高兴，三、四天，棉籽发芽了；五、六天，嫩芽拱土了。大伙惊奇得说：“平常地不干也得十二、三天出芽，没见过出得这么快的。这些年轻人真中！看来种地也需要文化、需要念书呐”。
    1956年的春天，龙万顺家乡六个村联合一起，一千一百十四户的高级合作社成立了，土地有一万四千亩。群众信任龙万顺，选他当了大社的技术股长。社里派他去唐山学习开锅驼机，回来以后他组织了一个九个人的锅驼机手训练班。他又举办了技术业余学校，有三百多农业社干部和农民参加，他给讲解当时农活上所需要的一些技术措施。他又学习了打机井技术，领导村里的青年打了一眼机井。
    秋天，拖拉机站建立起来。四部拖拉机轰隆隆地开进了农业社的耕地，翻耕了一万多亩土地。仅仅二年以前，这里的土地还被分割成一小块一小块的，只有八户贫农的几十亩土地像大海中的孤岛那样联结在一起。七寸步犁那时还是稀有的先进农具。现在，上万亩田地连成一片，拖拉机在田野轰鸣。机井灌溉的水田正要排水，葡萄蔓在压起来。龙万顺看到二年前的梦想已经成为现实，而前面的道路还会愈走愈宽愈广！
