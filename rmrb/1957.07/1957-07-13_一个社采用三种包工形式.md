    A Cooperative Adopts Three Types of Contract Work Systems
    (Our report) The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Jiang County, Shanxi Province, has implemented a system of contracting work and output. To strengthen cotton field management, the various production teams have adopted three different contracting methods: First, large-segment contracting. For example, the tenth production team divided tasks such as cotton seedling fixing, weeding three times, and removing the bracts of cotton seedlings into one large segment, implementing contracting work to individual households. In this way, each household manages the cotton fields very carefully. In the past, single men and members with many children were often deducted work points because they couldn't keep up with the unified labor time due to meals and housework. With household contracting, they can produce whenever they want. Second, small-segment temporary contracting. For example, the eleventh production team first determined different work points for the first management of cotton fields (such as weeding once or fixing seedlings) based on factors such as the size and type of weeds and how easy or difficult it was to weed. Members voluntarily formed temporary contracting groups to take on these tasks. After this segment of contracting was completed, the production team leader would inspect the work. Third, block-by-block temporary contracting. For example, the ninth and twelfth production teams inspected the cotton fields block by block, determined the different work points for each block based on the required processing degree and labor input, and then members voluntarily formed groups to take on the tasks. Generally, the standard was to complete the weeding of one block of land in one day. After the processing and management of a block of cotton field was completed, the group leader would lead the work assessment at the edge of the field, and after the team leader's inspection, work tickets would be issued. After each stage of farm work was completed, work points would be recorded according to the total number of work tickets.
    The implementation of the above three different cotton field management methods has greatly improved cotton field management and the organization of labor for cooperative members, and the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members has been unprecedentedly raised.

    一个社采用三种包工形式
    本报讯　山西省绛县东方红农业社实行包工包产以后，各个生产队采取了三种不同的包工办法来加强棉田管理：第一，实行大段包工。例如第十生产队，把棉花定苗、锄三遍以及棉苗脱裤等农活划分为一大段，实行包工到户。这样各户对棉田管理都很细致。过去单身汉和多子女的社员，经常因吃饭和家务事弄得赶不上大伙统一劳动的时间而被扣工分，以户包工后，啥时候生产都随便了。第二，实行小段临时包工。如第十一生产队把棉田的第一次管理（如锄一次或定苗），首先按草大草小、好锄难锄等情况，逐块确定不同工分，由社员自愿结合组织临时包工小组承包在这段包工结束后，由生产队长进行验收。第三，实行逐块临时包工。如第九生产队和第十二生产队把棉田逐块检查，按需要加工程度和用工情况，确定每块棉田的不同工分，然后由社员自愿结合组织小组承包，一般以一块地一天锄完为标准。在一块棉田加工管理结束后，由组长领导在地头评工，在队长验收后发给工票；每段农活结束后，按工票总数记工分。
    实行了以上三种不同的棉田管理办法，对棉田管理和社员劳动组织管理都有很大改进，社员劳动情绪空前提高。
