    Farmers in the Suburbs of Changchun Beat Drums and Gongs to Welcome New Cultured Commune Members
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Changchun) The first group of graduates from senior and junior high schools in Changchun City to participate in agricultural production totals eighty-five. They voluntarily went to the countryside to become glorious laborers.
    Today, people from all walks of life in Changchun City gathered to give a send-off to this group of graduates; farmers in the suburbs also beat drums and gongs to welcome their new commune members.
    Xu Shou Xuan, Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, spoke at the farewell meeting. He encouraged these outstanding young people to not be afraid of difficulties, to work hard, and to humbly learn from the old farmers. He also hoped that all senior and junior high school graduates in the province would learn from these classmates and break the old concept that "all other professions are base, only studying is noble."
    The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Changchun City has already arranged accommodation for these new commune members.

    本报长春电　长春市首批参加农业生产的本届高、初中毕业生共有八十五人。他们自愿到农村去做个光荣的劳动者。
