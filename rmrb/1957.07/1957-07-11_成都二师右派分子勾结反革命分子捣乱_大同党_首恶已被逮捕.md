Chengdu, July 9th (Reported by our correspondent Ji Xichen): On July 4th and 5th, all teachers and students of Chengdu Second Normal School held a conference to expose the conspiracies of rightists and counter-revolutionary cliques who colluded with each other to incite students to take to the streets, beat workers and police, and surround and harass the police station.

At Chengdu Second Normal School, due to weak political and ideological work, some students were afraid of hardship and believed that being a teacher had poor treatment and low status, and were not content with primary school education. Rightists and counter-revolutionaries took advantage of these weaknesses in students' thinking and their dissatisfaction with student grants, and, using the Wenhui Daily's June 2nd report about the beating of primary school teacher Chang Jinbai in Huaiyuan County, Anhui, seized the opportunity to incite students to stand against the Party. At the same time, they created chaos through big-character posters, slogans, and anonymous letters, putting forward slogans such as "Heads can be broken, blood can flow, but normal school is not to be read!" and inciting students to "fight against Communist Party members who have lost their humanity" and "drive Communist Party members out of educational work posts." These reactionary remarks were immediately opposed and refuted by the majority of students. Xu Changming, the chief culprit of the counter-revolutionary group, saw that the situation was not good and secretly held a meeting to study the situation. He believed that continuing to write anti-Party remarks was dangerous and decided to adopt "guerrilla warfare." He instructed "Datong Party" members Tong Wanli and Pei Yuanfu to, under the guise of supporting Chang Jinbai, demanding that the government increase student grants, and improve the treatment of primary school teachers, lead a small number of students to the streets to put up posters and provoke students to make trouble with the government.

On the evening of June 12th, when they went to the streets to put up posters, they were immediately stopped by workers from the Qianjin Iron Factory. The workers turned Tong and Pei over to the police station.

After the incident spread to the school, the rightist Peng Linrong saw an opportunity and immediately spread rumors that the police station had detained students and that workers had beaten students. As a result, more than a hundred students rushed out of the school one after another and surrounded the police station to make trouble. Peng also went to the scene in person to add fuel to the fire, making the students even more agitated, shouting slogans, randomly posting slogans and cartoons, and beating the chairman of the Qianjin Iron Factory's trade union, workers, and police. This erroneous action immediately angered the nearby masses. Thousands of citizens and passers-by flocked to reason with the students. A primary school teacher said to the students: After liberation, the lives of primary school teachers have greatly improved, and there is no need for you to call for it. A farmer carrying manure angrily said that the farmers save money to support you. You have food, clothing, and books to read, and you still want to make trouble! If you don't listen, we will use carrying poles. Many residents also criticized the students for not going to the streets to make trouble, and said that they have not graduated and are already arguing about treatment. How can this kind of thinking teach the next generation well? Under the righteous questioning of the masses, the students consciously felt that they were in the wrong and dispersed. In order to expand the situation, Peng Linrong returned to school and mobilized students to write a letter to the people of the city. When Peng's conspiracy was exposed, "Datong Party" members took the opportunity to spread rumors: "Director Peng has been arrested," attempting to provoke new dissatisfaction among the students.

In order to further persuade the students, the teachers successively invited student representatives to hold discussions. Some people's representatives, members of the CPPCC, and outstanding teachers also used their personal experiences to conduct comparative education for the students. At the same time, in order to expose the rumors and thoroughly clarify the truth about whether the workers beat the students, the Democratic Youth Federation, together with relevant parties, organized an investigation team to quickly confront the witnesses with the details of the incident, proving that the workers did not beat the students, but that the students beat the workers and the police. After the truth came to light, the students realized that they had been deceived and used by the rightists and counter-revolutionaries, and the incident subsided, and they admitted their mistake in taking to the streets to make trouble.

At the meeting, when everyone exposed the conspiracies of the rightists and counter-revolutionaries, they pointed out that the rightist Peng Linrong's father and two uncles were all local bullies and bandit leaders, and were suppressed after liberation. Therefore, he hated the Party very much, often cursed the Party and the government, and used double-dealing tactics to deceive and win over students, conspiring to cause a "major change." The counter-revolutionary Xu Changming, in April 1956, masqueraded as a Party member and infiltrated the school, wooing those who were dissatisfied with the Party. In March of this year, he formed a counter-revolutionary clique called "Datong Party," actively seeking out Kuomintang secret service organizations and planning for a "Datong Daily" and "Datong Army," expressing his "resolute opposition to the Communist Party to the end" and plotting to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship. After the public security organs discovered this, they, together with the school administration, warned and educated them and ordered them to disband; but they became more active and made a decision to "contact rightists" to start fires everywhere during the blooming.

The government, in accordance with the law, arrested Xu Changming, the chief culprit of the counter-revolutionary clique "Datong Party," and removed the rightist Peng Linrong from his post as deputy director of the teaching affairs office.

    成都二师右派分子勾结反革命分子捣乱
    “大同党”首恶已被逮捕
    本报成都9日电　记者纪希晨报道：7月4、5两日，成都第二师范全体师生举行大会，揭露了右派分子和反革命小集团相互勾结，煽动学生上街闹事，殴打工人、民警，包围哄闹派出所的阴谋活动。
    成都二师由于平时政治思想工作薄弱，部分学生怕艰苦，认为当教师待遇差，地位低，不安心小学教育事业。右派分子和反革命分子便利用学生思想上这些弱点和对助学金的不满情绪，并以6月2日文汇报关于安徽怀远县小学教师常金白被殴打的报道，乘机煽动学生起来与党对立。同时又用大字报、贴标语、写匿名信的方式，制造混乱，提出“头可断，血可流，师范学校不可读”的口号，煽动同学起来“向失掉人性的共产党员斗争”，把共产党员“赶出教育工作岗位”。这些反动言论当即遭到大多数学生的反对和驳斥。反革命集团首恶徐昌明见到风头不对，秘密开会研究形势，认为继续写反党言论有暴露危险，决定采取“游击战”，利用当时学生对助学金的不满，指示“大同党”分子童万里、裴元福打着声援常金白、要求政府增加助学金、提高小学教师待遇的幌子，带领少数学生上街张贴标语，挑拨学生和政府闹事。
    6月12日傍晚，当他们上街贴标语时，马上遭到前进铁工厂工人的劝阻。工人并将童裴二人扭送派出所。
    事情传到学校后，右派分子彭霖荣见有机可乘，马上造谣说派出所扣留了学生，工人打了学生。于是百多学生先后冲出学校，齐往包围派出所哄闹。彭并亲到现场，火上加油，学生更加冲动，高呼口号，乱贴标语、漫画，并殴打了前进铁工厂工会主席、工人和民警。这种错误行动立刻激怒了附近群众，成千的市民和过路行人纷纷涌来同学生讲理。一位小学教师向学生说：解放后，小学教师的生活大有改善，用不着你们呼吁。一个过路担粪的农民气愤地说，农民省吃俭用，供养你们。你们有吃有穿有书读，还要闹事！再不听招呼，我们要打扁担了。许多居民也纷纷斥责学生不应上街闹事，并说他们没有毕业就闹待遇，这种思想怎能教好下一代。在群众义正词严的责问下，学生们自觉理短，纷纷散去。彭霖荣为扩大事态，回校后，又发动学生写告全市人民书。当彭的阴谋败露时，“大同党”分子又借机造谣：“彭主任被逮捕了。”企图挑起学生们新的不满。
    为进一步说服学生，教师们先后邀请学生代表举行座谈。部分人民代表、政协委员、优秀教师也用亲身经历，向学生进行对比教育。同时，为揭露谣言，彻底弄清工人是否打了学生的真相，民主青联还会同有关方面，组织调查组，迅速将事情经过向目击者作了对证，证明工人并未殴打学生，而是学生打了工人和民警。真相大白后，学生始知受了右派和反革命的蒙蔽和利用，平息了事件，承认了上街闹事的错误。
    会上，大家揭发右派和反革命分子的阴谋时指出：右派彭霖荣的父亲及两个叔父都是恶霸匪首，解放后均被镇压。因此，对党十分仇恨，经常辱骂党和政府，并用两面派手法，欺骗拉拢学生，阴谋“大变动”。反革命徐昌明1956年4月冒充党员，混进学校，拉拢对党不满分子，在今年3月组成反革命小集团“大同党”，积极寻找国民党特务组织，并计划“大同报”“大同军”等，表示“坚决反共到底”，阴谋推翻人民民主专政。公安机关发现后，曾会同学校行政对他们进行警告、教育，命令他们解散；但他们却更积极活动，并作出在鸣放中要“联络右派分子”到处点火的决定。
    政府根据法令逮捕了反革命小集团“大同党”首恶徐昌明，撤销了右派分子彭霖荣教务办公室副主任的职务。
