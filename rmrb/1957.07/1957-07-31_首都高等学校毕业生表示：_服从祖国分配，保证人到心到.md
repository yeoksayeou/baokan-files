    Capital Universities and Colleges Graduates Declare:
    “Obey the Motherland's Assignment, Guaranteeing Body and Mind Arrive Together”
    (Our Newspaper) Since the State Council issued several regulations regarding the assignment of university and college graduates for the summer of 1957, graduating class students in many Beijing universities and colleges have been holding meetings to discuss them. Everyone unanimously supports the State Council's regulations and resolutely obeys the state's assignment, going to the regions and work posts needed by the motherland.
    Many schools' graduating class students have focused their discussions on the issue of obeying the motherland's assignment, and the vast majority of students have firmly expressed their obedience. Zheng Ning'er, from the Teacher Training and Translation Department of the Beijing Russian Language Institute, said: "I am a college student of New China. Wherever the motherland needs me to go, I will go. When personal aspirations conflict with the needs of the state, I will resolutely give up my personal aspirations, obey the needs of the state, and happily embark on my work post." The entire class of 2306 at Beijing Aviation Institute stated that they wanted to go to the most needed and most arduous places in the motherland to temper themselves. Chen Huiqin, from the Chinese Department of Peking University, said: "I plan to go to the Northwest. My body is quite strong, and I need to become even stronger while I am young." Students who previously had concerns about obeying the state's unified assignment have also begun to change their attitudes after studying the State Council's regulations for assigning graduates this year. One fourth-year class in the Law Department of the Renmin University of China, with thirty-four people, originally had 90% of its members requesting assignments in Beijing or Shanghai; now they all express their willingness to obey the state's assignment. Zhang Donglu, from the Power Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, previously only filled in the Beijing Thermal Power Plant as his preference, but now he also expresses his willingness to obey the state's assignment. Some students from the Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Medical College, and other schools have requested to revise their previously submitted preferences. Some people at Peking University and the Beijing Russian Language Institute who were previously unwilling to become middle school teachers now say that if the state needs them, they are willing to become middle school teachers.
    Overseas Chinese students also expressed their views after listening to Premier Zhou's report and seeing the State Council's instructions. Zheng Suimo, Chen Dasheng, and five other overseas Chinese students graduating from the Civil Engineering Department of Tsinghua University wrote a letter to Premier Zhou saying, "We returned to the motherland with a full of enthusiasm for building our country. Over the past few years, under the kind cultivation and education of the Party and the government, we have made great progress politically and academically. In the past, we lived a life of oppression and discrimination overseas, and we couldn't even talk about having any future or aspirations of our own. Now we have learned construction skills, and an infinitely bright future is unfolding before us. We deeply understand that this is what the Party has given us. Whether it is the borderlands of the motherland or the cities and villages, everywhere is our home. Wherever the motherland wants us to go, we will go. Every piece of land in the motherland is a place where we can work and live in peace. We guarantee that, together with our domestic classmates, we will resolutely and unconditionally obey the motherland's assignment, strive to go to the most difficult places, and dedicate our life's strength to the motherland's socialist construction."
    Graduates of various schools also refuted the fallacies of the right-wing elements regarding undermining unified assignment. Everyone believes that the right-wing elements' negation of the unified graduate assignment system is a way of taking the capitalist road, creating chaos, and undermining the country's planned socialist economic construction. Zhang Zhaoxiang, from the Translation Department of the Beijing Russian Language Institute, said, "We are college students cultivated by the people's blood and sweat, not commodities in the market, but cadres for building socialism. Engaging in a free market contradicts the country's construction plans, and the result will inevitably affect socialist construction, making it impossible for the places that need people most to get them." Many graduating students from the Chinese Department of Peking University said, "The 'free market' is actually engaging in capitalism, which is incompatible with our country's system."
    The graduating students of various schools also specially talked about the regulations regarding graduates participating in physical labor. Everyone believes that this is of extreme importance for raising graduates' political awareness, transforming themselves, and establishing a labor concept. Everyone also unanimously supports the measures taken by the State Council against right-wing elements among the graduates and those who disobey assignments and make trouble without reason. Zhang Zhenbin, from the Translation Department of the Beijing Russian Language Institute, said, "If we were to vote by raising our hands, the students in our class would all raise both hands in approval."
    Many graduates have said that the anti-Rightist struggle is a fierce class struggle. Everyone must resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate the influence of right-wing thought and arm themselves. We must not only graduate in professional studies, but we must also graduate politically. Everyone expressed that they must seriously and conscientiously do their political appraisal, obey the state's assignment, guarantee that both body and mind arrive, and add a brick to the motherland's socialist edifice.

    首都高等学校毕业生表示：
    “服从祖国分配，保证人到心到”
    本报讯　自从国务院发出关于高等学校1957年暑期毕业生分配工作的几项规定以后，北京高等学校许多毕业班学生，都纷纷开会讨论。大家一致拥护国务院的规定，坚决服从国家分配，到祖国需要的地区和工作岗位上去。
    许多学校的毕业班同学，都着重讨论了服从祖国分配的问题，绝大部分同学都坚决表示服从祖国分配。北京俄语学院师范翻译系郑宁儿说：“我是新中国的大学生，祖国需要我到那里去，我就到那里去。当个人的志愿与国家的需要发生矛盾的时候，我坚决放弃个人的志愿，服从国家的需要，愉快地走上工作岗位”。北京航空学院二三○六班全体同学表示，我们要到祖国最需要和最艰苦的地方去锻炼自己。北京大学中文系陈惠钦说：“我打算到西北去。我的身体挺棒，正需要在年青的时候锻炼得更坚强”。过去对服从国家统一分配有顾虑的同学，学习了国务院今年分配毕业生的几项规定以后，也都开始有了转变。中国人民大学法律系四年级一个班有三十四个人，原有90％的人要求分配在北京、上海工作；现在都表示愿意服从国家分配。清华大学动力系张东鲁，过去填志愿只填北京热电厂，现在他也表示愿意服从国家分配。北京矿业学院、北京医学院等学校都有部分同学，要求修改过去所填的志愿。北京大学和北京俄语学院有的人过去不愿当中学教员，现在表示，假如国家需要，也愿意去当中学教员。
    华侨同学在听了周总理的报告和看到国务院的指示后，也表示了他们的看法。清华大学土木工程系毕业的华侨同学郑燧模、陈达生等七个人写信给周总理说，我们怀着建设祖国的满腔热情，回到祖国来。几年来，我们在党和政府的亲切地培养和教育下，在政治上和学习上都有很大的提高。过去，我们在海外过着受压迫、受歧视的生活，谈不上自己有什么前途和志愿，现在我们已经学会了建设本领，在我们面前展开了无限美好的前途，我们深深地懂得这是党给予我们的。不论是祖国的边疆，还是城市和乡村，到处是我们的家。祖国要我们到那里去，我们就到那里去。祖国每一块土地上都是我们安心工作和生活的地方。我们保证和国内同学一起，坚决地、无条件地服从祖国分配，争取到最艰苦的地方去，把自己毕生的力量，贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    各校毕业生还驳斥了右派分子关于破坏统一分配的谬论。大家认为，右派分子否定毕业生统一分配制度，是要走资本主义的道路，造成混乱，以破坏国家的有计划的社会主义经济建设。北京俄语学院翻译专科张兆祥说，“我们是人民的血汗培养出来的大学生，不是市场上的商品，而是建设社会主义的干部。搞自由市场是和国家的建设计划有矛盾的，结果必然影响到社会主义的建设，使得最需要人的地方得不到人”。北京大学中文系许多毕业同学都说，“自由市场”实际上是搞资本主义，这是和我们国家的制度不相容的。
    各校毕业同学还特别谈到了关于毕业生参加体力劳动的规定，大家认为这对提高毕业生政治觉悟，改造自己，树立劳动观念，有极重要的意义。国务院对毕业生中的右派分子和对不服从分配、无理取闹的人，所采取的措施，大家也一致拥护。北京俄语学院翻译专科张振彬说，“如果要举手表决，我们班的同学都是双手赞成”。
    许多毕业生都说，反右派斗争是一场激烈的阶级斗争。大家要坚决彻底全部的清除右派的思想的影响，把自己武装起来。不仅要在业务学习上毕业，而且一定要在政治上毕业。大家表示，要严肃认真地做好自己的政治鉴定，服从国家分配，保证人到心到，为祖国的社会主义大厦砌上一块砖。
