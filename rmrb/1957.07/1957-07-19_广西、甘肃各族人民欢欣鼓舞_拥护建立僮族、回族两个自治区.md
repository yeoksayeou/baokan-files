Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 17th. The Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a symposium on the 16th. At the meeting, people of all ethnic groups warmly supported the resolution passed by the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. At the meeting, a telegram of respect was sent to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

At the symposium of the CPPCC Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, more than 30 representatives of seven ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Han, and Mulam, spoke. They also refuted the slanderous remarks of rightist Huang Shaohong, who tried to provoke friendly relations between ethnic groups in Guangxi.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 17th. After the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress passed the resolution on the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Hui people in vast areas of Gansu Province were overjoyed and unanimously expressed their warm support.

Ma Dunjing, Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, told reporters: The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a great happy event for all Hui people. This is a concrete manifestation of the respect and being masters of our own affairs. During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang did not regard us as a nation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have equal rights. Ma Fengtu, a member of the China Hui People's Cultural Association and a member of the Gansu Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission, and Wang Jinlu, Deputy Governor of the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture, both said: This is another demonstration of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's concern and love for our ethnic minorities. Our long-cherished wish has come true today.

On the morning of the 16th, when newspapers carrying the news of the decision to establish the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were delivered to Jincheng Pass, the Hui people's street in Lanzhou, dozens of Imams and Hui people were learning culture in the classroom. They immediately asked the teacher to read the newspaper first. Wei Zhaolin, an 84-year-old man who had lived through three dynasties and was a model student in the Lanzhou anti-illiteracy movement, said with great interest: "I spent 38 years in the Qing Dynasty and 38 years under the rule of the Kuomintang, but I have only been happy in the eight years since liberation. In the Qing Dynasty and under the Kuomintang, we were often hungry and could not get enough to eat. The Hui people had no status and could not learn culture, but today it has been decided to establish an autonomous region and let us be masters of our own affairs. How can we not be happy?" That afternoon, three to four hundred Hui people in Jincheng Pass held meetings in four mosques, where Imams conveyed the news of the decision to establish the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to the masses.

    拥护建立僮族、回族两个自治区
    新华社南宁17日电  广西省民族事务委员会和政协桂西僮族自治州委员会，于16日举行座谈会，会上各族人民热烈拥护第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议通过成立广西僮族自治区的决议。会上，并向全国人民代表大会常务委员会发了致敬电。
    在政协桂西僮族自治州的座谈会上，僮、汉、仫佬等七个民族的三十多名代表发了言。他们还驳斥了右派分子黄绍竑挑拨广西各民族之间友好关系的谰言。
    新华社兰州17日电  当全国人民代表大会第四次会议通过成立宁夏回族自治区的决议以后，甘肃省广大地区的回族人民，不胜欢欣鼓舞，一致表示热烈拥护。
    甘肃省政协副主席马惇靖向记者发表谈话说：宁夏回族自治区的成立，是全体回民的大喜事，这是回民受到尊重、当家作主的具体表现。在蒋介石统治时期，国民党不把我们当作一个民族。解放后，在共产党的领导下我们才有了平等权利。中国回民文化协进会委员、甘肃省民族事务委员会委员马凤图、固原回族自治州副州长王进禄等都表示：这是共产党和毛主席对我们少数民族又一次的关怀和爱戴，多年的愿望今天实现了。
    16日上午，当刊载着决定成立宁夏回族自治区消息的报纸，送到兰州的回民街——金城关的时候，几十个教长、阿訇和回民正在课堂上学文化，他们立刻要求教员先读报。身经三个朝代的八十四岁老人魏兆麟，是兰州市扫盲运动中的学习模范，他兴致勃勃地说：“我在清朝经过了三十八年，在国民党统治时期也经过了三十八年，但是解放后这八年我才得到了幸福。在清朝和国民党时代我们经常挨饿吃不饱，回族没有地位学不到文化，可是今天决定成立自治区，让我们当家作主，怎能不高兴。”这天下午，金城关的三四百名回民，分别在四个清真寺里开了会，教长和阿訇们向群众传达了决定成立宁夏回族自治区的消息。
