Xi'an, July 10th (Reporter Li Qian) - Tens of thousands of construction workers in the Xi'an area are working intensely on the construction sites of more than fifty new and renovated factories. These newly built factories include modern mechanical and electrical factories and power plants designed with Soviet assistance, an instrument factory designed with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic, and textile, printing and dyeing, and pesticide factories designed by our own country.

　　On the site of the Han Dynasty capital in the western suburbs, four electrical factories designed with Soviet assistance are under construction. Among them, the workshops of the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory have all been built, and the tool and machine repair workshops have been put into production; in some major workshops, installation workers are installing machinery. This factory will be officially put into production in the first quarter of next year. It is China's first factory to manufacture various power capacitors, and when it is officially put into production, it will be able to produce one million kilovolt-amperes of capacitors annually. The Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Rectifier Factory, Insulation Materials Factory, and High-Voltage Electrical Porcelain Factory are also the largest and most advanced factories of their type in China. In particular, the design of the Switch Rectifier Factory not only adopted the existing advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also implemented the latest research results. At present, some workshops have been built in these three factories. They are all planned to start production in 1960. After these factories are put into production, they will produce many products that could not be produced domestically in the past. High-voltage power transmission and distribution equipment and mercury rectifiers needed for the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station, electrified railways, and other aspects can be changed from imports to domestic supply.

　　To the east of the four electrical factories is the construction site of China's first modern thermal instrument factory - the Xi'an Instrument Factory. Construction workers have already built some buildings such as staff dormitories here, and are currently handling earthwork in the production area. This factory will be put into production in 1959. This factory, designed with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic, is a comprehensive instrument manufacturing factory. It can manufacture pressure gauges, vacuum gauges, temperature measuring instruments, electronic instruments, flowmeters, regulators, gas analyzers, automotive instruments, and various accessories for the chemical, petroleum, power, and metallurgical industries.

　　On the banks of the Chan River in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an, new-style factory buildings and buildings that cannot be seen at a glance have been filled. The Baqiao Textile Zone on the east bank of the Chan River is building the Northwest's first printing and dyeing factory with an annual output of more than three million pieces of printed and colored cloth, which is currently China's largest modern printing and dyeing factory. This factory was designed by our own country, and most of the machinery and equipment are also manufactured by our own country. Now, the prefabricated components of the factory buildings have been basically hoisted, and it is expected to be put into production next year. The Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, which is also being built in this textile zone, began trial production on July 1. This is the fourth modern cotton textile factory built by the state in the Xi'an area during the First Five-Year Plan period. After this factory with more than 94,000 spindles is put into production, the Baqiao Textile Zone will become a textile base with more than 320,000 spindles and 8,500 automatic looms.

　　On the east bank of the Chan River, there are also a large number of vehicles transporting building materials coming and going, and the motors of cranes and mixers are roaring day and night. Here, several mechanical factories are under construction.

    西安五十多个工厂紧张施工
    一批现代化的机械厂、电工厂两三年内可陆续建成
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：西安地区数万名建筑职工正在五十多个新建、改建的工厂工地上进行紧张的施工。这些新建的工厂有苏联帮助设计的现代化机械厂、电工厂和发电厂，有民主德国帮助设计的仪表厂，也有我国自己设计的纺织厂、印染厂和农药厂。
    在西郊汉代都城的遗址上，苏联帮助设计的四个电工厂正在加紧建设中。其中西安电力电容器厂的厂房已经全部建筑起来，工具和机修车间已经投入生产；在一些主要厂房里，安装工人正在紧张地安装机器。这个工厂在明年第一季度就可以正式投入生产。它是我国第一个制造各种电力电容器的工厂，正式投入生产以后，每年可以生产一百万仟乏尔的电容器。西安高压开关整流器厂、绝缘材料厂和高压电瓷厂也是我国同类型工厂中最大最先进的工厂。尤其是开关整流器厂的设计，不仅采用了苏联已有的先进经验，而且贯彻了最新研究的成果。目前，这三个工厂都已经建起了一部分厂房。它们都计划在1960年开工生产。这几个厂投入生产以后，将生产许多国内过去不能生产的产品。像三门峡水电站、电气化铁路以及其他方面需要的高压输电、配电设备和水银整流器等，都可以由进口改成国内供应了。
    在四个电工厂东边，是我国第一个现代化的热工仪表厂——西安仪表厂的工地。建筑工人们已经在这里建起了一些职工宿舍等建筑，目前正在生产工区处理土方。到1959年，这个厂即可投入生产。德意志民主共和国帮助我国设计的这个厂是一个综合性的仪表制造厂。它能够给化工、石油、电力、冶金等工业制造压力表、真空表、测温仪表、电子仪表、流量计、调节器、气体分析器、车用仪表和各种配件。
    在西安东郊的滻河沿岸，已经布满了一眼看不到边的新型的厂房和楼房。滻河东岸的灞桥纺织区正在修建一个年产三百多万匹花布、色布的西北第一印染厂，这是我国目前最大的现代化印染厂。这个厂是由我国自己设计的，机器设备也绝大部分是我国自己制造的。现在，这个工厂厂房的预制构件已经基本上吊装完毕，预计明年即可投入生产。也是建设在这个纺织区的西北国棉六厂已经在7月1日开始试生产。这是第一个五年计划期间国家在西安地区建设的第四个现代化棉纺织厂。这个拥有九万四千多枚纱锭的工厂投入生产以后，灞桥纺织区就变成一个拥有三十二万多纱锭和八千五百多台自动布机的纺织基地了。
    在滻河的东岸，也有大量运输建筑材料的车辆来往奔驰，起重机和搅拌机的马达声日夜在轰鸣。这里，几个机械厂正在建设中。
