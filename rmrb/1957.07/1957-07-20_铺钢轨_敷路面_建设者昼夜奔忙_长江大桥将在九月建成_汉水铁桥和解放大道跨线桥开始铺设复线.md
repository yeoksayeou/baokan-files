    Laying Rails, Paving Roads: Builders Work Day and Night
    Yangtze River Bridge to Be Completed in September
    Han River Railway Bridge and Jiefang Avenue Overpass Begin Laying Double Tracks
    (Our dispatch) According to the Changjiang Daily, the builders of the Yangtze River Bridge are working intensely on the finishing touches, and preparations for the inspection and acceptance work before the bridge is fully completed have also begun.
    Now, the steel rainbow spanning both sides of the Yangtze River has been completely fixed in place on the piers; the riveting work of the steel beams has been basically completed, and the builders are busy with the final inspection work. On the tall steel beams, paint workers climb high into the air, applying silver-gray paint to the steel beams. This is the third time people have put new clothes on the steel beams.
    Black anti-corrosion railroad ties from the Northeast and Hanyang Railroad Tie Anti-Corrosion Factory have been shipped to the construction site in large quantities, and the railway part of the Yangtze River Bridge has begun to lay rails. Workers on the steel beams are extending the heavy rails recently produced by Anshan Iron and Steel from the center of the bridge to both banks. The first layer of reinforced concrete bridge deck on the highway surface of the bridge can be completed recently. The railings of the approach bridges on both sides have been installed, and the wire mesh and sidewalk railings on both sides of the railway bridge are being installed. According to the person in charge of the Construction Technology Department of the Bridge Engineering Bureau, they are striving to complete the entire bridge before the end of September. These days, the workers have given up their weekend holidays and are working in two shifts day and night to ensure that the bridge is completed before the end of September.
    In addition, in order to cooperate with the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge and the future laying of double tracks on the Jinghan Railway, the Han River Railway Bridge and the Jiefang Avenue overpass have begun to lay double tracks. The project will be completed together with the Yangtze River Bridge.

    本报讯  据长江日报消息：长江大桥的建设者正在紧张地进行收尾工程，全桥竣工前的检查验收工作，也已开始筹备。
    现在，横跨长江两岸的钢铁长虹，它的位置已全部在桥墩上固定下来；钢梁铆合工作已基本结束，建设者正忙于最后的检查工作。在高大的钢梁上，油漆工人攀登在高空，把银灰色的油漆涂抹在钢梁上。这是人们第三遍为钢梁穿上新衣。
    来自东北和汉阳枕木防腐厂的黑色防腐枕木，已大批的运到了工地，长江大桥铁路部分开始铺设钢轨。工人们在钢梁上，正把鞍钢最近出品的重型钢轨从桥梁的中心地带向两岸伸去。大桥公路面第一层钢筋混凝土桥面板，最近可以铺设完竣。两岸引桥的栏杆已经安装好，铁路桥两边的铁丝网和人行道栏杆，正在安装。据大桥工程局施工技术处负责同志对记者说：他们争取全桥在9月底以前竣工。这几天，工人们已放弃了星期休假，日夜两班的加紧施工，保证大桥在9月底以前建成。
    又讯  为了配合长江大桥通车和将来京汉路铺双轨，汉水铁桥和解放大道跨线桥已经开始铺设复线。工程将和长江大桥一同完成。
