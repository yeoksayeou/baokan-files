    Workers Know How to Cherish Their Own Regime
    The Chinese working class has a broad mind, but we are not forgetful.
    Speech by Lin Qiangyun
    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of all the leaders. Now, as an old worker, I would like to express some opinions on this solemn platform.
    I left my hometown at the age of thirteen to become an apprentice in the city, and later became a seaman. Through long years, like workers across the country, I suffered discrimination, unemployment, hunger, exploitation, oppression, and a life worse than that of slaves and beasts of burden in the old society. Those who oppressed us seamen included imperialists, warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, foremen, and their henchmen. Under such layers of dark rule and oppression, we were left with no way out in our own country. Abroad, we couldn't even stand up straight, drifting in foreign lands, even ending up as food for the fishes. At that time, which official in the so-called government ever spoke half a word for us?
    The Soviet October Revolution pointed out a bright path for Chinese workers. Especially after the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, our eyes were opened, our consciousness was raised, and our courage was encouraged. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the seamen of Guangdong held the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike in 1922, paralyzing the British imperialist maritime transport in the Far East and turning Hong Kong into a stinking port. In 1925, all Hong Kong workers and Guangzhou workers held the Guangdong-Hong Kong Strike to support the Shanghai "May 30th" Movement, shaking the colonial rule of the American, British, Japanese, and French imperialists in the Far East. These struggles demonstrated the incomparably great power of the working class's unity.
    The Guangdong-Hong Kong workers' strike struggle continued for a long time. Under the close leadership of the Communist Party, it promoted the high tide of the First Domestic Revolution. The workers of Guangdong and the peasants of the whole province directly supported the victorious situation of the Northern Expedition. However, the counter-revolutionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek carried out a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Guangdong on April 15, 1927, usurping the fruits of the revolutionary victory and massacring Communists and worker-peasant masses. At that time, the rightists, under the slogan of "Rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go free," spared no one, from the gray-haired to the three-day-old infant. In places like Honghuagang, Yuexiu Mountain, and Nantian Stone in Guangzhou, the number of our martyred comrades who were massacred was more than tens of thousands! The famous Guangdong-Hong Kong strike was dissolved, the anti-imperialist movement was banned, and the revolutionary workers were massacred!
    In order to answer the Kuomintang counter-revolution's brutal slaughter, the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of Guangdong held the Guangzhou Uprising in December 1927, establishing a people's democratic regime led by workers, which pointed out the direction of the subsequent struggles of the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary red flag fluttered in Guangzhou for three days, which were three days when the people of Guangzhou themselves controlled the regime. Afterwards, counter-revolutionary armed forces counterattacked Guangzhou, and the streets of the city were filled with the corpses of massacred Communists, workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, and the blood stained the water of the Pearl River red. The blood of the Soviet consul in Guangzhou and the staff of the consulate also mingled with the blood of our martyrs on the streets of Guangzhou! Fellow delegates! As early as thirty years ago, for the cause of justice, the blood of the Soviet people flowed together with the blood of the Chinese people!
    From then on, our working class, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, under the leadership of the Communist Party, persisted in revolutionary struggles of unspeakable hardship, spending more than twenty long and dark years. In those dark days, we lived in hunger and cold, suffered unbearable persecution, with wives and children scattered, and families ruined. Recalling it now, this hatred is hard to dispel. Our predecessors threw countless heads and shed boundless blood, advancing wave upon wave, and finally achieved the victory of the revolution and established our current people's regime. We workers understand how precious and how much we should cherish our own regime.
    Since the liberation of the whole country, the working class and the people of the whole country have become the masters of the country. We know how to arrange our production and life. For more than eight years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the workers have exerted a high degree of labor enthusiasm to build our own motherland. In the past, our labor was to supply the exploitation of the bourgeoisie, but now our labor is for our own class and all the people. Our labor has been very successful. Taking our Guangdong as an example, compared with 1949, the total industrial output value in 1956 increased by 3.84 times, and the total handicraft output value increased by 1.77 times. On the basis of the development of production, the workers' lives have also been significantly improved. The average annual wage in 1949 was 322 yuan, while the average annual wage in 1956 was 532 yuan. More than 370,000 employees in the province enjoy national labor insurance benefits, solving the problems of birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability that workers worry about. Before liberation, workers were in danger of unemployment at any time, but now it will not happen again. We deeply realize that with the leadership of the Communist Party, there is everything for the working people, and with socialism, there is a happy life for the working people.
    Just as the socialist construction cause of the whole country is developing rapidly, and the people of the whole country are striving with full confidence to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and prepare to welcome the second five-year plan, the Party launched a rectification movement in order to better lead the people of the whole country in socialist construction and to overcome the shortcomings of the Party's work. However, the bourgeois rightists have once again come out and taken the opportunity to carry out their reactionary activities, using the excuse of helping the Party rectify its work to conspire to overthrow the leadership of the Party, overthrow the socialist system, usurp the leadership of the country, realize capitalist restoration, and drag the working class and the people of the whole country back to the tragic life of the past. I want to solemnly tell the rightists on this solemn platform: your shameful conspiracy has failed!
    The Chinese working class has a broad mind. But we workers are not forgetful. The betrayal of the Kuomintang rightists thirty years ago has already taught us not to be paralyzed and lose class vigilance. Some of the current rightists have hands stained with the blood of our revolutionary martyrs in the past. After liberation, they still held important positions in the country and have never expressed any repentance for their past behavior, which makes us feel uncomfortable. But we listen to the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, and in order to unite all the forces that can be united to build our lovable socialist motherland, we do not dwell on old grudges and do not remember past grievances, hoping that they will accept transformation, reform themselves, and start anew. We are also prepared that if they are blinded by greed and act recklessly, we workers fully understand and have the power to retaliate.
    I hope that the rightists will clear their minds and recognize that the Chinese working class is the pillar of the Chinese people's democratic regime. Whoever overestimates their strength and dares to undermine our regime will be battered and bleeding. We workers have long been determined that we must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate the people's democratic regime, establish a socialist society, and establish an unbreakable and permanent friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We will defend the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system with unparalleled courage.

    工人懂得如何爱护自己的政权
    中国工人阶级的胸怀是宽大的，但我们并不是健忘者。
    林锵云的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。现在我以一个老工人的身份，在这个庄严的讲台上，来发表一些意见。
    我从十三岁就离开家乡，到城市里去当学徒，以后就做海员工人。经过漫长的岁月，如全国工人一样，在旧社会里，备受歧视，失业、饥饿、剥削、压迫等等的痛苦，过着奴隶牛马不如的生活。压在我们海员工人头上的有帝国主义、军阀、官僚、买办、包工头及其爪牙。在这样层层黑暗的统治与压迫底下，我们处身国内，则走头无路，在国外更伸不直腰，流落异国，甚至葬身鱼腹。那时的所谓政府，有哪一个官吏，替我们讲过半句话？
    苏联十月革命，给中国工人指引出一条光明出路。尤其是中国共产党诞生后，擦亮了我们的眼睛，提高了我们的觉悟，鼓舞起我们的勇气。广东的海员工人，在中国共产党的领导下，一九二二年举行了香港海员大罢工，瘫痪了英帝国主义的远东海上运输，把香港变成臭港。一九二五年，全香港工人和广州工人为支援上海“五卅”斗争，举行省港大罢工，动摇了美、英、日、法帝国主义在远东的殖民统治。这些斗争显示着工人阶级团结的无比的伟大力量。
    省港工人的罢工斗争，长期持续着，它在共产党的紧密领导下，促进了第一次国内革命高涨。广东工人和全省农民直接支持了北伐战争的胜利局势。可是，当时以蒋介石为首的反革命集团，却于一九二七年四月十五日在广东实行叛变革命，篡夺革命胜利果实，大举屠杀共产党人和工农群众。那时的右派分子，在“宁可枉杀一千，不愿放纵一个”的口号下，上至白发苍苍，下至出生三天的小孩，也不能幸免，而遍及广州市的红花岗、越秀山、南石头等地方，我们被屠杀的烈士，何止数以万计！有名的省港罢工被解散了，反帝国主义运动也被禁止了，革命的工人被屠杀了！
    为了回答国民党反革命的残酷杀戮，广东工人、农民和革命知识分子，于一九二七年十二月举行了广州起义，建立以工人为领导的人民民主政权，它指示了以后革命群众的斗争方向。革命的红旗在广州飘扬了三天，这是广州人民自己掌握政权的三天。以后，反革命武装反扑入广州，全市街道上躺满了被杀害的共产党人、工人、农民、革命知识分子的尸体，鲜血染红了珠江的河水。在广州的苏联领事和领事馆的工作人员的鲜血，也和我们烈士的鲜血一同凝结在广州市的街道上！各位代表！早在三十年前，为了正义的事业，苏联人民的鲜血便和中国人民的鲜血流在一起了！
    从此，我们工人阶级、农民和革命的知识分子，在共产党领导下，坚持了难以言语形容的艰苦的革命斗争，度过漫长而黑暗的二十多年。在那黑暗的日子里，我们过着饥寒交迫的生活，受到忍无可忍的迫害，妻离子散，家破人亡。及今回忆，此恨难消。我们的先烈掷无数头颅，流无量鲜血，前仆后继，才最后取得了革命的胜利，建立起我们现在的人民政权。对于我们自己的政权，应如何地宝贵，应如何地爱护，我们工人是懂得的。
    自全国解放以后，工人阶级和全国人民已成为国家的主人。我们知道该怎样安排我们的生产和生活。八年多以来，工人们在党和人民政府的领导下，发挥了高度的劳动热忱，来建设我们自己的祖国。过去我们的劳动是为了供给资产阶级的剥削，现在我们的劳动是为了自己的阶级和全体人民。我们的劳动是很有成绩的。拿我们广东来说，和一九四九年相比，一九五六年工业总产值增加了三点八四倍，手工业总产值增加一点七七倍。在发展生产的基础上，工人的生活也显著地改善了。一九四九年的年平均工资为三百二十二元，一九五六年的年平均工资则为五百三十二元。全省职工享受国家劳保待遇的有三十七万多人，解决了工人所忧虑的生、老、病、死、伤、残的问题。在解放前，工人有随时失业的危险，现在不会有了。我们深切地体会到，有了共产党的领导，就有了劳动人民的一切，有了社会主义，就有了劳动人民的幸福生活。
    正当全国的社会主义建设事业飞速发展，全国人民都在满怀信心地争取提前完成第一个五年计划，并准备迎接第二个五年计划的时候，党为了更好地领导全国人民进行社会主义建设，为了克服党的工作缺点，发动了整风运动。但是，资产阶级右派分子却又钻了出来，乘机大肆其反动活动了，他们借口帮助党整风，阴谋推翻党的领导。推翻社会主义制度，篡夺国家的领导权，实现资本主义复辟，把工人阶级和全国人民，拖回到过去的悲惨生活中去。我要在这个庄严的讲台上，正告右派分子：你们的可耻的阴谋，已经失败了！
    中国工人阶级的胸怀是宽大的。但我们工人并不是健忘者。三十年前国民党右派分子的叛变，已经教会了我们不要再麻痹，失去阶级警惕。现在的右派分子，有些是过去便手上沾着我们的革命烈士的血的。解放后他们还位居国家要职，从未表示过对过去的行为有丝毫的忏悔，我们心里是不舒服的。但我们听党和毛主席的教导，为了团结一切可以团结的力量来建设我们可爱的社会主义的祖国，不念旧恶，不记前仇，希望他们接受改造，革面洗心，重新做人。我们也早已准备着，如果他们竟利令智昏，胡作非为，我们工人完全懂得而且有力量给以还击。
    我希望右派分子们，清醒一下脑筋，要认识中国工人阶级是中国人民民主政权的支柱，谁要不自量力，敢破坏我们的政权，谁就会碰得头破血流。我们工人早已确定：必须在中国共产党领导下，巩固人民民主政权，建立社会主义社会，建立中苏两国人民永久的牢不可破的友谊。我们要以无比的勇气，保卫中国共产党，保卫社会主义制度。
