In a Mountainous Area 1,600 Meters Above Sea Level
    “The People's Power is as Great as Heaven; Rocks and Barriers are Pierced Through;
    With the Communist Party's Good Leadership, Thousands of Mu of Barren Land Become Fertile Fields.”
    Joint Speech by Li Fangyao, Wu Tongming, and Lu Zhenfan
    We completely agree with Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report and the various reports of the大会, and suggest that the大会 approve and adopt them.
    Now, I will give a brief report to the大会 on the situation we observed in Changshi Township, Dading County, Guizhou Province.

        “Eating Sugar Cane Upside Down”
    Changshi Township (one township, one commune) is located on the edge of Guizhou, with the highest point being 1,600 meters above sea level. The transportation is dangerous, and it is a high-altitude, cold, barren mountainous area inhabited by various ethnic groups.
    Before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups here lived a subhuman life worse than that of cattle and horses. They worked all year round but couldn't get enough to eat, even eating fern roots and tree bark, and wearing coir clothing, paper clothing, and dog skin (those wearing coir clothing and paper clothing accounted for about 30 percent of the township's population, while the rest of the farmers wore linen). On average, about 25 percent of the people went out to escape famine or work, and when there were famine years, they were displaced and suffered unspeakable pain. There is a ballad here that vividly depicts the unspeakable tragic situation of the people at that time: "In the past, poor people had two knives over their heads: heavy rent and high interest; at that time, poor people only had three ways out: fleeing famine, hanging themselves, and going to jail." After the land reform, the Party and the government fully led the agricultural production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. Production increased year by year, and people's lives improved day by day. In 1955, the township's total grain output reached more than 3.77 million jin, exceeding 105 percent of that in 1952. At the beginning of 1956, on the basis of the township's 21 primary cooperatives, the Changshi Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative was established. There were 1,575 cooperative households, accounting for 97.52 percent of the township's total households. Among them, 1,130 were Han, accounting for 71.7 percent; and 445 were Yi, Miao, and Gelao, accounting for 28.3 percent. Although the first year of the cooperative suffered a rare drought in decades, thanks to the initiative and creativity of the vast number of cooperative members, they finally overcame the severe natural disaster and won a bumper harvest. Grain output increased by 18.7 percent compared to 1955, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the advanced cooperative. During the autumn harvest distribution, 92 percent of the cooperative members increased their income, and the average grain retention per person reached 595 jin, greatly exceeding the state-stipulated standard for unified purchase and retention. The Kong Dequan family, which earned the most, received 14,221 jin of grain and 69.29 yuan in cash. According to a typical survey of 35 households in the Hongshan team of the cooperative, the average income of the poor peasant class had already exceeded the level of the old middle peasants in the team in 1954. Now, all cooperative members are wearing cotton clothes. During festivals and market days, many people put on new clothes. In the past, they didn't have salt to eat, but now each person eats more than 9 jin of salt per year. After the autumn harvest distribution, people spread the word, saying, "The advanced cooperative is doing a good job. It has not only overcome the severe drought but also increased production and income." "Now life is like eating sugar cane upside down, the more you eat, the sweeter it gets." Last year, when other townships wanted to split up the cooperatives, the people here responded, "It's okay to split up when a family is living its own life, but our cooperative cannot be split up." The Changshi Advanced Cooperative has firmly taken root among the peasant masses. Cooperativization is guiding people to fundamentally get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity.

          Where Does the Sweetness Come From
    In this high-altitude and barren mountainous area, production has been rising year after year, mainly due to grasping the following key points:
      (1) Building water conservancy projects to expand the area of paddy rice cultivation. Here, it is either drought when it doesn't rain, and people have been living a painful life of water shortage and dry mountains for many years, and production and domestic water use are very difficult. However, this problem has never been solved in history. After the land reform, the masses were mobilized to solve the problem. At first, many people thought that this was "something that even the Heavenly Master could not do." Some said, "If you can build a waterway, you can fry eggs in the palm of your hand!" In view of the arduous project and the great concerns of the masses, through more than three months of repeated mobilization, and inspired by the model action of Xue Juming, secretary of the CPC District Committee, who risked his life to explore the source of water, tied himself with ropes, and went deep into the Yin River cave of "Guoquan Cave" for on-the-spot surveys, the concerns of the masses were dispelled. Using 170,000 workdays, the waterway, which was 24 li long, was dug through, and the water problem that had not been solved for thousands of years was solved once and for all. In the past few years, Changshi Commune has newly opened up 4,601 mu of paddy fields, exceeding more than six times the original paddy field area. The unit area yield of farmland has been doubled. People composed a folk song to sing the praises of the Communist Party and their new life. "The people's power is as great as heaven; rocks and barriers are pierced through; with the good leadership of the Communist Party, thousands of mu of barren land become fertile fields." The Party and the People's Government have established supreme prestige among the masses.
    (2) Comprehensively improve farming techniques, increase fertilizer application, improve soil, and expand the area of multiple cropping. The soil in Changshi is barren, and farming is extensive. The masses said, "There are places where even maggots don't grow when you defecate," and the unit area yield is extremely low. In the past few years, the people of Changshi have used the method of "typical experiments, gradually promoted" to promote methods such as repairing mountain ditches, changing sloping land into terraced fields and terraced land, and mixed forestry and grain production to maintain water and soil; promoted improved varieties, mud and salt water seed selection, new-style seedbeds, sowing seedlings in low places and transplanting them in high places, fast composting of manure piles for seedling cultivation, and advanced yield-increasing experiences such as corn hybridization, artificial pollination, and intercropping have achieved remarkable results. In terms of accumulating and producing fertilizer, the implementation of various methods of accumulating and producing fertilizer, such as tile urn composting and corn husk composting, has been effective. In 1956, an average of more than 5,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, exceeding ten times the amount of fertilizer applied in 1952. Soil improvement work has also been done very well. In the past few years, Changshi Commune has burned a total of 5.45 million jin of lime to improve 2,530 mu of acidic soil, and excavated 41,584,000 jin of pond mud to improve more than 2,000 mu of soil, which has played an active role in increasing the unit area yield of farmland. On the basis of improving soil and increasing fertilizer application, the multiple cropping area in 1956 rose to 51.5 percent of the total cultivated land area, an increase of 13.63 percent compared to 1955.
    (3) Reclaim wasteland to expand the cultivated land area. According to the characteristics of having a large population and little land, Changshi Township organized forces to carry out wasteland reclamation work in the neighboring Shanba Township. By the end of 1956, a total of more than 1,000 mu of wasteland had been reclaimed, and the Shanshui Fresh Livestock Farm had been set up. Not only did it increase income, but it also initially changed the face of Shanba. Farmers sang such folk songs: "Before liberation, wild beasts walked into the house with the fog in Shanba Plain, no grain grew, only grass grew, freezing people to death! Starving people to death!" "After liberation, the Communist Party is the great savior in Shanba Plain, the land is turned over and grain is produced, and sheep run on the grassland." This is another way for Changshi Commune to increase production year after year.
    (4) Vigorously develop diversified operations, opening up endless ways to increase production. They attach great importance to developing diversified operations. In forestry, a total of more than 560,000 tea trees, more than 190,000 tung trees, and more than 50,000 *juanzi* trees have been planted. This year, more than 16,000 seedlings of high-quality Guanggan oranges and apples were introduced from Sichuan, with a survival rate of about 95 percent. In animal husbandry, the commune has 612 sheep and 988 cattle raised publicly. And 32 breeders were trained, and there is also a veterinary organization, which enables animal husbandry to develop normally. They also operate more than 20 kinds of sideline production such as flour mills, papermaking, and brick and tile factories. It is estimated that by 1962, the proportion of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations will rise from 21 percent in 1957 to 57.7 percent, and by 1967, it will rise to 68 percent. This vividly illustrates that if mountainous areas only expect to develop agriculture, it is impossible to make farmers rich.
    The family sideline occupations of cooperative members have also developed greatly. At present, there are pig raising, chicken raising, palm rope making, and straw sandal making. As of April this year, cooperative members raised 1,368 pigs, including more than 110 sows, which can produce more than 1,000 piglets this year, with an average of more than two pigs per household; more than 16,300 chickens are raised, with an average of 10.4 chickens per household, and the most households raise 35 chickens.

          Moving Forward
    The Changshi Advanced Agricultural Cooperative is doing well, and it has accumulated a lot of experience in production and operation, but the following points should also be noted:
    Due to the emphasis on grain production, inappropriate land reclamation has been carried out. In the future, on the premise of ensuring grain production, a plan for the rational use of land should be made to solve the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in terms of land requirements, prevent soil erosion, and ensure agricultural production; while developing diversified operations, a balanced arrangement should be made in all aspects. Changshi Commune plans to invest 18,000 yuan this year (the government subsidy is 4,000 yuan) to build a 20-kilowatt hydropower station for lighting and rice milling. It is not very urgent at present, and if electricity is used for rice milling, the existing 13 water mills will inevitably be left unused; in dealing with the relationship between the commune and cooperative members, there are still some problems, such as the fact that the cooperative members' private plots are generally worse than those of the commune. In addition to the factor of cooperative members "snatching work points," it is inseparable from the fact that the commune is too strict. Some cadres are growing complacent, and they are less concerned about the difficulties of cooperative members than before, and the solutions to problems are slower than before; in the implementation of ethnic policies, the relationship between the various ethnic groups is united, but the ethnic minorities with small populations have not been properly arranged as commune cadres; in addition, the method of "remuneration according to the principle that sideline occupations are subordinate to agriculture, that is, the labor days engaged in agriculture, sideline occupations, or other specialties are all calculated according to the value of the labor days engaged in agriculture" also needs to be appropriately adjusted. We have reported the above issues to the province and county respectively, and they all attach great importance to them, and some issues have been corrected.
    The superiority of cooperativization is undeniable. It is inconceivable that Changshi Commune would have been able to overcome the severe drought unprecedented in decades and win increased production last year without the collective disaster resistance force of cooperativization. What about the situation in the entire Guizhou? The absurd remarks of the right-wing elements who clamor that "cooperativization has no superiority" and "the lives of farmers are more difficult than before cooperativization" cannot stand up to refutation and have nothing in common with the belief of the laboring farmers of all ethnic groups in loving the Communist Party and resolutely taking the road of cooperativization. In the high tide of the cooperativization movement, some shortcomings also occurred, but these were just some unavoidable defects in the road of progress, and they have been basically corrected through the rectification of the commune. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the achievements of the cooperativization movement will be consolidated and the cause of socialist construction will be victorious.
    Please criticize and correct any inappropriate remarks in the above speech.

    在海拔一千六百公尺的山区里
    “人民力量大如天，是岩是坎都打穿；
    共产党来领导好，千亩瘦土变良田。”
    李仿尧、吴通明、陆镇藩的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和大会各项报告，建议大会予以批准通过。
    现在，我将我们在贵州省大定县长石乡视察的情况，向大会作一简要的汇报。
        “倒吃甘蔗”
    长石乡（一乡一社）地处贵州边缘，最高地带海拔一千六百公尺，交通险阻，是一个高寒、贫瘠、多民族杂居的山区。
    解放前，这里的各族人民过的是牛马不如的非人生活，终年劳动，不得一饱，甚至吃蕨根、树皮，穿棕衣、纸衣和狗皮（穿棕衣、纸衣的约占全乡人口的百分之三十，其余农民穿的都是麻布）；平均每年约有百分之二十五左右的人外出逃荒或做工，遇到荒年则更是流离失所，痛苦莫名。这里流传着这样的歌谣：“过去穷人头上两把刀：租子重，利息高；那时穷人只有三条路：逃荒，上吊，坐监牢。”形象地描绘了当时人民遭受的不可言状的悲惨境遇。土改后，党和政府全力领导开展了以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动，生产逐年提高，人民生活日益改善。一九五五年，全乡粮食产量达三百七十七万余斤，超过一九五二年的百分之一百零五。一九五六年初，在全乡二十一个初级社的基础上，建成了长石高级农业生产合作社。入社农户一千五百七十五户，占全乡总农户的百分之九十七点五二。其中汉族一千一百三十户，占百分之七十一点七；彝、苗和?佬族等共四百四十五户，占百分之二十八点三。建社的第一年虽然遭受了数十年罕有的旱灾，由于发挥了广大社员的积极性和创造性，终于战胜了严重的自然灾害，赢得了丰产，粮食产量比一九五五年增加百分之十八点七，显示了高级社的无比优越性。秋收分配时，百分之九十二的社员增加了收入，每人平均留粮量达五百九十五斤，大大地超过了国家规定的统购留粮标准。收入最多的孔德全家，分得粮食一万四千二百二十一斤，现金六十九元二角九分。根据该社红山队三十五户的典型调查，贫农阶层的平均收入已经超过该队老上中农一九五四年的水平。现在，全体社员穿的都是棉布衣服，在过节、赶场的时候，很多人都穿上了新装；过去没有盐巴吃，现在每人每年要吃九斤多盐巴。在秋收分配结束后，人们奔走相告，都说：“高级社办的好，不仅战胜了严重的旱灾，而且增加了生产增加了收入。”“现在的生活是倒吃甘蔗，越吃越甜。”去年别的乡要分社时，这里的群众反映说：“一家人过日子还可以分，我们的社就是不能分。”长石高级社在农民群众中牢固地扎下了根基。合作化正引导着人们从根本上摆脱贫困，走向富裕的道路。
          甜从何来
    在这个高寒贫瘠的山区里，生产得以连年上升，主要是抓住了以下几个关键：
      （一）兴修水利，扩大水稻播种面积。这里不雨即旱，多年来一直过着缺水、干山的痛苦生活，生产和生活用水都很困难。但是，在历史上这个问题一直没有得到解决。土改后，发动群众解决了这个问题。一开始，好些人都认为这是“天师也办不到的事情”，有的说：“修得出条水来，手掌心都可以煎鸡蛋！”针对工程艰巨，群众顾虑大的情况，通过三个多月的反复发动，和中共区委书记薛巨明为了探明水源，以绳索系身，置生死于度外，深入“锅圈洞”的阴河洞穴实地勘测的模范行动的感召，破除了群众的顾虑。用去十七万个工，挖通了全长二十四华里的水道，千百年来没有解决的水的问题，一劳永逸地解决了。几年来，长石社新开稻田四千六百零一亩，超过原有稻田面积的六倍以上。农田单位面积产量得以倍计地增长。人们编了一首歌谣歌唱共产党，歌唱自己的新生活。“人民力量大如天，是岩是坎都打穿，共产党来领导好，千亩瘦土变良田。”党和人民政府在群众中树立了至高无上的威信。
    （二）全面改进耕作技术，增施肥料，改良土壤，扩大复种面积。长石土地贫瘠，耕作粗放，群众说：“有的地方屙屎都不生蛆”，单位面积产量极低。几年来，长石人民运用“典型试验，逐步推广”的办法，推行了修拦山沟，改坡土为梯田、梯土，林粮混作等办法以保持水土；推广了良种，泥、盐水选种，新式秧田、矮处撒秧高处栽，粪堆速成育秧以及玉米杂交、人工授粉和套作等先进增产经验取得了显著成绩。在积制肥料方面，推行了瓦瓮式积肥、玉米葫积肥等多种积制肥料的办法都获得成效。一九五六年平均每亩施肥五千斤以上，超过一九五二年施肥量的十倍。改良土壤工作也做得十分出色。几年来，长石社共烧制石灰五百四十五万斤，改良酸性土壤二千五百三十亩，挖取塘泥四万一千五百八十四万斤，改良土壤二千余亩，对提高农田单位面积产量起到了积极的作用。在改良土壤和增施肥料的基础上，一九五六年复种面积上升到全部耕地面积的百分之五十一点五，比一九五五年扩大百分之十三点六三。
    （三）开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。长石乡根据人多地少的特点，组织力量在近邻的山坝乡进行了垦荒工作。至一九五六年年底止，共开垦了一千多亩荒地，并设置了山水新鲜畜牧场。不仅增加了收入，而且也初步改变了山坝的面貌。农民唱着这样的歌谣：“解放前的山坝坪，野兽随雾走上门，不长粮食光长草，冷死人呀！饿死人！”“解放后的山坝坪，共产党是大救星，土地翻身出谷子，草原上面跑羊群。”这是长石社得以连年增产的又一个办法。
    （四）大力发展多种经营，开辟了无穷尽的增产门路。在开展多种经营方面，他们是非常重视的。在林业方面，前后共种植了茶叶树五十六万余窝，油桐十九万余棵，卷子五万余棵；今年并从四川引起良种广柑、苹果一万六千余株，成活率达百分之九十五左右。在畜牧业方面，全社公养羊六百一十二只，牛九百八十八头。并训练了三十二名饲养员，还有一个兽医组织，这就使畜牧业得以正常发展。他们还经营了粉坊、造纸、砖瓦等二十多种副业生产。预计到一九六二年，林、牧、副业的比重将由一九五七年的百分之二十一上升到百分之五十七点七，到一九六七年则将上升到百分之六十八。生动地说明了山区如果只指望发展农业，是不能够使农民富裕起来的。
    社员的家庭副业也有较大发展，现在搞起来的有养猪、养鸡、打棕绳、打草鞋等。迄至今年4月，社员养猪一千三百六十八头，其中母猪一百一十多头，本年可生千多头小猪，平均每户能养两头多一点；养鸡一万六千三百多只，平均每户十点四只，最多的户养三十五只。
          再进一步
    长石高级农业合作社是办得好的，在生产经营方面也积累了不少的经验，但尚应注意以下几点：
    由于强调粮食增产进行了不适当地开荒，今后应在保证粮食生产的前提下，作好合理利用土地的规划，以解决农、林、牧业相互间对土地要求的矛盾，制止水土流失，保障农业生产；在发展多种经营的同时，要作好各方面的平衡安排，长石社今年计划投资一万八千元（政府补助四千元），修建二十瓩水电站一所，用作照明和碾米之用，目前并不是十分迫切的，且碾米改用电力以后，现有十三座水碾势必被搁置不用；在处理社和社员的关系上，还存在着一些问题，如社员的自留地普遍比社的搞得差，除了社员“抢工分”这个因素外，与社里抓得过紧是分不开的，部分干部滋长着自满情绪，对于社员群众的困难过问的比以前少了，解决问题比以前迟缓了；执行民族政策上，各民族的关系是团结的，但对于有的人口少的民族未适当安排社干；此外，采用“副业服从农业的原则计酬，即无论是从事农业、副业或其他一项专业的劳动日，均以从事农业的劳动日所值计酬的办法，也有必要作适当的调整。以上这些问题，我们已分别向省、县作了汇报，他们都很重视，有的问题已经作了纠正。
    合作化的优越性是无可置辩的。不能设想，不是由于发挥了合作化的集体抗灾力量，长石社能够在去年战胜数十年来未有的严重旱灾，而赢得增产。整个贵州的情况又何尝不是如此呢？那些叫嚷“合作化没有优越性”，“农民生活比合作化以前还要苦”右派分子的荒谬言论，是经不起驳斥的，是与各族劳动农民爱戴共产党和坚决走合作化道路的信念没有任何共同之处的。在合作化运动的高潮中，也曾发生过一些缺点，这不过是前进道路中一些难以避免的缺陷，而且通过整社已基本得到纠正。我们深信，在中国共产党和毛主席正确领导下，合作化运动的成果一定能够得到巩固，社会主义建设事业一定能够取得胜利。
    以上发言如有不当之处，请批评指正。
