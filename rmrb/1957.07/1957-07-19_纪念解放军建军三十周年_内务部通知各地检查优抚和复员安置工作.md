Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Ministry of Internal Affairs recently issued a notice to civil affairs departments at all levels, requiring them to further strengthen preferential treatment and resettlement work as an important part of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The notice requires all regions to organize inspection teams from county and city governments above the county level to conduct a serious inspection of preferential treatment and resettlement work before and after "August 1st".

The notice points out that in terms of preferential treatment, rural areas should focus on checking the implementation of this year's preferential treatment labor day work. During the inspection, agricultural cooperatives should also be urged to properly arrange for the family members of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production activities that they are capable of, and help them engage in sideline production to increase their income.

The notice requires all regions to also conduct a serious inspection of the production and living conditions of the family members of martyrs and military personnel in urban areas. For the elderly and orphaned households of martyrs who have difficulties in life, regular and quantitative subsidies should be given to ensure their livelihoods.

In terms of the resettlement of demobilized soldiers, the notice requires all regions to mainly check whether the newly returned demobilized soldiers have been properly resettled, whether they have been consolidated in various production positions, and whether they have fully played an active role. At the same time, the difficulties in production and life of demobilized soldiers who have been resettled in rural areas in the past should also be checked, and they should be helped to solve them. At the same time, demobilized soldiers should also be educated to understand the current practical difficulties of the country, and they should be encouraged to continue to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army of hard struggle and close ties with the masses. In the spirit of building the country and managing the family with diligence and thrift, they should unite基层cadres and the masses, actively engage in labor production, and work together with all farmers to strive to make greater contributions to socialist construction.

In cities, factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions with a large number of demobilized soldiers should be helped to conduct necessary inspections on the training and education of demobilized soldiers, work arrangements, familiarizing themselves with business, mastering technology, and solving some of their living difficulties, in order to summarize experience and improve work. At the same time, demobilized soldiers should also be educated to abide by the work system and labor discipline of their units, play an exemplary role in the implementation of wage policies, and unite with workers to do a good job in production and strive to overfulfill the state's production tasks.

    纪念解放军建军三十周年
    内务部通知各地检查优抚和复员安置工作
    新华社18日讯  内务部最近向各级民政部门发布通知，要求以进一步加强优抚和复员安置工作作为纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年的重要内容。通知要求各地在“八一”前后，由县、市以上政府组织检查组，对优抚、复员安置工作进行一次认真的检查。
    通知指出，在优抚工作方面农村应着重检查今年优待劳动日工作的执行情况。在检查中还应当督促农业社妥善安排烈属、军属参加他们力能胜任的生产活路，帮助他们从事副业生产，以增加他们的收入。
    通知要求各地也对城市烈属、军属的生产、生活情况进行认真的检查，对于生活有困难的烈属孤老户，应该给以定期定量的补助使他们的生活有所保障。
    在复员军人安置方面，通知要求各地主要检查对新回乡的复员军人是否已进行了妥善的安置，是否已使他们在各个生产岗位上巩固下来，并是否充分发挥了积极作用。同时，对过去已经安置在农村的复员军人，也应检查他们在生产、生活上存在的困难，帮助他们加以解决。同时，也要教育复员军人体贴国家当前的实际困难，鼓励他们继续保持和发扬中国人民解放军艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的光荣传统，本着勤俭建国、勤俭治家的精神，团结基层干部和群众，积极劳动生产，同全体农民一道，争取在社会主义建设中作出更大的贡献。
    在城市中应帮助复员军人较多的厂矿、企业、事业单位在对复员军人的培养教育，工作安排，熟习业务，掌握技术，以及解决他们在生活方面的某些困难等进行必要的检查，借以总结经验，改进工作。同时，也要教育复员军人遵守所在单位的工作制度和劳动纪律，在执行工资政策等方面起模范作用，还要团结好职工搞好生产，为争取超额完成国家生产任务而努力。
