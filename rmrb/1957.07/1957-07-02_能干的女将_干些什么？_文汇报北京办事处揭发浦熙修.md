What Does a "Capable Female General" Do?
Wenhui Daily Beijing Office Exposes Pu Xixiu

(Reported by our newspaper) The editors, reporters, and staff of the Wenhui Daily Beijing Office held their third meeting yesterday, focusing on exposing Pu Xixiu's reactionary activities and demanding that she thoroughly explain her relationship with Luo Longji and others.

Ye Gang said that Pu Xixiu's guiding ideology in leading the work of the office came from the right-wing group within the China Democratic League Central Committee. On June 8th, the People's Daily began to counterattack the fallacies of the right-wing ambitious elements. On the afternoon of June 8th, she called Comrade Lu Dingyi, asking if the People's Daily was "收" (收 can mean "stopped", "withdrawn", or "ended") by doing this? She said that intellectuals would not dare to speak anymore, and defended Chu Anping in the phone call. That afternoon, she also spoke with Lou Bangyan, Fei Xiaotong, and others to discuss so-called rational articles criticizing Chu Anping. After the 10th, reporters from the office proactively suggested interviewing progressive figures in cultural and educational circles to publish talks refuting the anti-socialist and anti-communist fallacies of the right-wing elements, but Pu Xixiu was very passive, disagreed with doing so, and said that being a journalist was difficult, let's just write about zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting! Pu Xixiu had been resisting the anti-rightist struggle all along. It wasn't until the ambitious faces of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji were exposed, and Wenhui Daily put Zhang, Luo, and Chu together in the headlines, that she made a long-distance call to the Shanghai editorial department to express her disagreement.

Wu Wen said that in late May, the Shanghai editorial department instructed us to organize more "impartial opinions." On May 30th, based on the instructions of the editorial department, I brought back a speech manuscript by Chen Yuan from the United Front Department's symposium. At the time, I considered this speech manuscript to be impartial and prepared to send it to Shanghai via special telegram. However, Pu Xixiu said no and didn't send it. On June 1st, another reporter from our newspaper and I brought back Chu Anping's speech manuscript and reported to Pu Xixiu: "At today's meeting, Deng Chumin's speech was impartial and can also be sent via special telegram." Pu Xixiu asked to send Chu Anping's manuscript via special telegram, but refused to send Deng Chumin's speech manuscript.

Mei Duo said: When the "People's Daily" began to counterattack the right-wing elements, we repeatedly suggested to Pu Xixiu that we should immediately organize progressive figures in the cultural, educational, and scientific circles to publish talks counterattacking the right-wing elements. However, Pu Xixiu repeatedly expressed her disagreement, believing that the anti-rightist remarks in the newspapers were not convincing with reason and could not solve the problem. Instead, she insisted on finding Fei Xiaotong, Lou Bangyan, and others to write an article that "convinced with reason" from the perspective of the national system. Pu Xixiu's behavior was essentially an attempt to use "convincing with reason" as a guise, organizing Fei Xiaotong, Lou Bangyan, and others to write articles to cover up for Chu Anping.

Xie Weiming said that based on my impression of the Wenhui Daily Beijing Office over the past eight years, Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu had frequent contact. Pu consulted Luo on every important matter. In 1954, the All-China Journalists Association held a meeting to discuss the list of journalists for the National Committee of the CPPCC. Pu Xixiu was invited to participate. At the meeting, she proposed the name of Yan Baoli, the deputy director of Wenhui Daily. After the meeting, Pu Xixiu returned to the office and talked to me about the nomination process. Then, she called Luo Longji and talked about it. Luo scolded her, "You are too naive, why didn't you propose your own name!" That night, Pu Xixiu wrote a letter to the person in charge of the All-China Journalists Association. Although I don't know the content of the letter, Pu Xixiu really became a member of the CPPCC afterward. I think this was a tactic by Luo Longji to raise Pu Xixiu's political status. Later, Pu Xixiu was also elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, which may also be related to Luo Longji's activities.

Liu Guanghua said that I am new to journalism, and I am extremely heartbroken about the serious political errors committed by the newspaper and myself. The "Peking University Democracy Wall" newsletter was written by me based on a letter from a Peking University student, supplemented with some materials, as instructed by Pu Xixiu. This newsletter unilaterally exaggerated the abnormal emotions and the role of big-character posters among university students, causing chaos in universities across the country. She also sought Luo Longji's opinion after the manuscript was written. She showed far greater interest in this manuscript than other manuscripts. In addition to attaching a handwritten letter, she also made a long-distance call to strongly request the Shanghai editorial department to publish it.

Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu attended the meeting. The meeting will continue.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 1st. Today's Wenhui Daily published news of a staff meeting revealing some facts about how rightist Luo Longji colluded with Pu Xixiu, deputy editor-in-chief of the newspaper, to use Wenhui Daily to carry out anti-socialist activities.

Ye Gang revealed: After 12 o'clock on the night of May 10th, Luo Longji called the Beijing Office, blaming the newspaper's reporters for not writing about the United Front Department's symposium because Luo Longji was not satisfied with the稿子 (gaozi can mean "draft" or "copy") issued by Xinhua News Agency.

Yao Fangzao, a reporter from the Beijing Office, said: Luo Longji's exclusion of the leftists in the China Democratic League also affected our interview work. An obvious example is writing Pan Guangdan's interview notes. Originally, Pan Guangdan was a confidant of Luo Longji, so Pu Xixiu had a good relationship with Pan. Therefore, Pan's erroneous remarks were reported. Deng Chumin published an article in the newspaper entitled "My Understanding of the Spirit of Chairman Mao's Speech." After reading it, Pu Xixiu said it was dogmatic and wanted to organize articles to criticize him.

The staff revealed that Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu had held secret consultations before the Wenhui Daily was re-published. Editor Jiang Dingben said: When Wenhui Daily was re-published last year, there were two plans: one was to change the Teachers' Newspaper to Wenhui Daily, and the other was to separate the Teachers' Newspaper and Wenhui Daily, each publishing its own. Pu Xixiu agreed with the first plan, and Luo Longji was furious, scolding Pu Xixiu for being confused. Luo said, "Only changing the name, with the same old team, what role can it play?"

Photojournalist Chen Genbao said: As far as I know during my stay in Beijing, Pu Xixiu conveyed many policies, most of which came from the China Democratic League or Luo Longji himself. At the time of re-publication, Pu Xixiu drafted a list of contributors, which had been discussed with Luo. Zheng Yongxin, the leader of the reader's letters group, said: "When Pu Xixiu came to Shanghai this time, she talked to me once, saying that Luo Longji was wholeheartedly helping the Party rectify its work style and had no malice at all. She also said that Chu Anping was in seclusion and thinking about his mistakes, and that Chu didn't have any problems either."

    “能干的女将”干些什么？
    文汇报北京办事处揭发浦熙修
    本报讯　文汇报北京办事处编辑、记者及职工，昨天举行第三次会议，着重揭露浦熙修的反动活动，要求她彻底交代她与罗隆基等的关系。
    叶冈说，浦熙修领导办事处工作的主导思想是来自民盟中央的右派集团。6月8日人民日报开始反击右派野心分子的谬论。8日下午，她就打电话给陆定一同志，问人民日报这样做是不是“收”了？说这样做知识分子不敢再说话了，并且在电话中为储安平辩护。这天下午她又与楼邦彦、费孝通等通电话，商量所谓批评储安平的说理文章。10日以后，办事处记者主动提出要访问文教界进步人士发表谈话，驳斥右派分子的反社会主义反共谬论，但是浦熙修十分消极，不同意这样做，并且说，新闻记者难做，我们还是写些琴棋书画吧！浦熙修对反右派斗争是一直抗拒的，直到章伯钧、罗隆基的野心家面目被揭露，文汇报在标题上把章、罗、储并列，她还特地打长途电话到上海编辑部表示不能同意。
    吴闻说，5月下旬，上海编辑部指示我们，要多组织些“持平之论”。5月30日，我根据编辑部指示，从统战部座谈会上带回来一篇陈垣的发言稿，这篇发言稿我当时认为是持平之论，预备发专电到上海去。可是浦熙修说不要，没有发。6月1日，我和本报另一记者带回储安平的发言稿，并且向浦熙修汇报：“今天会上，邓初民的发言是持平之论，也可发专电。”浦熙修叫把储安平稿子用专电发出去，而对邓初民发言稿则拒绝发稿。
    梅朵说：当“人民日报”开始反击右派分子的时候，我们几次向浦熙修提出，应该立即组织文教科学界进步人士发表反击右派分子的谈话，而浦熙修却一再表示不同意，认为报纸上反击右派分子的言论都不是以理服人，不能解决问题，自己却坚持要找费孝通、楼邦彦等写一篇从国家体制出发的“以理服人”的文章。浦熙修这种行为，实质上是企图用“以理服人”作为幌子，组织费孝通、楼邦彦等写文章为储安平打掩护。
    谢蔚明说，根据我在文汇报北京办事处八年来的印象，罗隆基和浦熙修是接触频繁的，浦每逢重要事情，都向罗请示。1954年，中国新闻工作者联谊会开会，协商政协全国委员会新闻界委员的名单，浦熙修应邀参加，她在会上提出文汇报副社长严宝礼的名字；开完会，浦熙修回到办事处，把提名经过和我谈了。接着，她打电话给罗隆基，谈起这件事，罗责备她说：“你太幼稚了，为什么不提自己的名！”当天晚上，浦熙修写了一封信给新闻工作者联谊会负责同志，信里的内容我虽不了解，但以后真是浦熙修当了政协委员。我觉得，这是罗隆基抬高浦熙修政治地位的一种手法。后来，浦熙修又当选了民盟候补中央委员，可能也和罗隆基的活动有关。
    刘光华说，我从事新闻工作不久，对报社和自己所犯的这样严重的政治错误，是极其痛心的。“北大民主墙”这篇通讯，是浦熙修指示我根据一封北大学生来信，补充了一些材料写成的。这篇通讯，对大学生中的不正常情绪和大字报的作用加以片面渲染，在全国高等学校中引起混乱。她在稿子写好后还征求过罗隆基的意见。她对这篇稿子还表现了比别的稿子远为浓厚的兴趣，除亲笔附函外，并打长途电话坚决要求上海编辑部发表。
    徐铸成、浦熙修曾出席过会议。会议将继续举行。
    本报上海1日电　今天的文汇报发表了该报召开工作人员大会的消息，消息中揭露了右派分子罗隆基勾结该报副总编辑浦熙修，利用文汇报进行反社会主义活动的一些事实。
    叶冈揭露：5月10日夜十二时以后，罗隆基打电话给北京办事处，责备本报记者为什么不写统战部座谈会的消息，因为罗隆基不满意新华社发的稿子。
    北京办事处记者姚芳藻说：罗隆基排斥民盟左派，也影响到我们的采访工作。明显的例子如写潘光旦的访问记。原来潘光旦是罗隆基的亲信，因此浦熙修和潘关系也很好。所以潘的错误言论也就得以上报了。邓初民在本报发表了一篇“我对毛主席讲话精神的体会”，浦熙修看了说是教条主义，要组织文章批评他。
    工作人员们揭露罗隆基和浦熙修在文汇报复刊之前就进行了密商。编辑蒋定本说：去年文汇报复刊，有两个方案，一个是教师报改为文汇报，一个是教师报与文汇报分开，各出各的。浦熙修赞成第一个方案，罗隆基大怒，骂浦熙修糊涂。罗说，只改一个名字，还是原班人马，能起什么作用？
    摄影记者陈根宝说：就我留京一段时期所知，浦熙修传达许多政策，大半来自民盟或者就是罗隆基个人。复刊时，浦熙修拟了一张组稿名单，曾和罗商量过的。读者来信组组长郑永欣说：“这次浦熙修来上海曾和我谈过一次话，她说，罗隆基是一心一意帮助党整风，根本没有什么恶意。又说，储安平正在闭门思过，还说储也没有什么问题。”
