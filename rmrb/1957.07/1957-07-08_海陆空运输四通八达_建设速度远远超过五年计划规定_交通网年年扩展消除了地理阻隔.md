Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Chao reports: The construction speed of China's sea, land, and air transportation has far exceeded the targets set in the Five-Year Plan. By the end of June this year, China had newly laid more than 4,700 kilometers of railway, exceeding the Five-Year Plan target by more than 400 kilometers. The handling capacity of newly built and renovated docks reached over 6.8 million tons, with the handling capacity of seaports exceeding the Five-Year Plan target by 26%. Furthermore, 36 ocean routes, totaling 20,000 nautical miles, have been opened. Air transport routes have expanded to over 20,000 kilometers, exceeding the target set in the First Five-Year Plan by 2,000 kilometers. During the Five-Year Plan period, the central government invested in the construction of 10,100 kilometers of new highways, which was completed ahead of schedule by the end of last year. By the end of June this year, the total length of highways open to traffic had increased by nearly double compared to 1952.

After several years of construction, the face of China's old transportation system has undergone fundamental changes.

In terms of railways, the paralyzed state inherited from old China has been transformed. Old China's railways were all invested and built by British, German, French, Belgian, and Japanese imperialists. To facilitate their economic aggression, the lines were concentrated in coastal and plain areas. The southwest and northwest regions, which account for about 60% of the country's area, had only about 6% of the country's railways. The railway standards of the various imperialist countries were different, and these railways were managed by the imperialists, becoming their blood-sucking tubes. In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, China laid more than 4,000 kilometers of railways, averaging about 1,000 kilometers per year. From the construction of the first railway to the national liberation in 1949, under the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang governments, it took 71 years to build more than 20,000 kilometers of railways, averaging more than 280 kilometers per year. Comparing the annual railway construction mileage, the speed of railway construction in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan was more than three times faster than the speed of railway construction in old China. Moreover, most of the railways built in the first four years were built in rugged mountainous areas. The 2,000-meter-long Qinling Tunnel was built, completing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, allowing trains to enter the "Land of Abundance" - Sichuan; the Wushaoling Ridge was leveled, transforming a natural barrier into a thoroughfare, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, connected to the Longhai Railway, was partially opened to traffic, eliminating the geographical isolation between the Northwest and the motherland. The newly built Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is now passing through the large sand dunes in the eastern part of the famous Tengger Desert. The track-laying project in the northern section has crossed Xishan Zui, more than 100 kilometers away from Baotou. After the connection in Yinchuan next year, the two major industrial areas of Northwest and Inner Mongolia will be connected. While building new railways, the old railways were also renovated, and double tracks were laid in areas with many industries. Since 1953, China has added more than 500 domestically-made large locomotives on these railway lines, so the amount of goods transported now has increased by nearly double compared to 1953.

The changes in civil aviation are even more prominent. In 1953, China established its first professional flight team in history. Now, this professional flight team has exerted a huge impact on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production. Many important production and construction materials for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the First Automobile Factory, and the Yumen Oilfield were transported by aircraft. Prospecting aircraft have discovered more than 50 mineral deposits. Survey aircraft have measured water sources and terrain for irrigation in the Yellow River area. Locust-killing aircraft have wiped out more than 3 million mu of locusts for farmers in the past two years. This year, aircraft have also been used to transport silkworm eggs, saplings, and to eliminate mosquitoes and insects for residents. After the opening of air routes to Altay and Urumqi in Xinjiang last year, airplanes crossed the desert to transport fish, shrimp, and medicines to Altay. The fish and shrimp in Altay are no longer left to rot as fertilizer, and people's lives have also improved.

Although China had civil aviation transportation 28 years ago, it had always been controlled by imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists. At that time, aircraft were only used by reactionary rulers as tools for plundering people's wealth and engaging in speculative activities. On the eve of national liberation, even these scarce airplanes and airports were destroyed by them during their retreat. Not a single plane taken over by the people's regime could fly. But now, China has a vast air transport network. With Beijing as the center, 38 important industrial and mining cities, from Qiqihar in the north to Hainan Island in the south, from Xinjiang in the west to Shanghai in the east, have been connected. Two years ago, pilots successfully flew over the "Roof of the World" at an altitude of 7,000 meters. It takes more than a month to travel from Beijing to Lhasa by land, but now it only takes a few hours by plane. During the First Five-Year Plan, China also opened nine international routes, including China to Vietnam and China to Myanmar, and carried out joint transportation with these countries. In the past few years, the tonnage of newly added aircraft in China has increased by more than 80% compared to 1952.

In terms of water transport, China's powerful sea and river transportation industry has grown in struggle. At the time of national liberation, the major ports were severely damaged by the Kuomintang army. They also threw a large number of explosives and obstacles into the ports and looted ships totaling 600,000 tons. In the early days of liberation, the Chiang Kai-shek army continued to bomb, destroy, and blockade maritime transport with aircraft. However, a maritime transport network with Shanghai, Dalian, and Guangzhou as the centers, connecting Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and dozens of other ports, has now been formed. Seagoing ships can transport goods on 36 routes. Recently, direct river-sea routes have been opened from Dalian to Nanjing, Jiujiang, Ma'anshan, and other thirteen cities, greatly improving transportation efficiency. The coastal ports of Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and other seven major ports have been rebuilt and restored, and ships with a deadweight of 10,000 tons can enter the ports. Tianjin's Tanggu Port could not originally berth ships with a deadweight of 3,000 tons. After the expansion in 1953, ships from 16 countries with a deadweight of 10,000 tons could berth for loading and unloading.

During the First Five-Year Plan, China also built Zhanjiang Port, which is the first modern port built independently by China in history. After its completion, it can handle 4.6 million tons of goods annually. After the completion of the first phase of the main project last year, the deep-water port, which can simultaneously berth two giant ships with a deadweight of 10,000 tons, has been opened. The Yangtze River and other inland rivers have been dredged and the navigation marks have been reformed, increasing the total length of navigable inland waterways in the country by more than 8,000 kilometers compared to 1952. Night navigation has been fully implemented on the Sichuan River. Now, the deadweight tonnage of ships operating on the sea and river has increased by 80% compared to before 1953, and more than doubled compared to the early days of liberation.

The results of highway construction in the past few years have greatly changed the transportation situation in minority areas. In the early days of liberation, there were more than 70,000 kilometers of highways open to traffic. In minority areas, which account for 65% of China's area, there were very few highways, and even fewer automobiles. In the past three or four years, in addition to the newly built highways, China has also repaired and opened more than 100,000 kilometers of highways, which is equivalent to the mileage of highways open to traffic in the 35 years of Kuomintang rule. Many of these highways are in minority areas. After the opening of the huge Kangding-Tibet Highway and Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the political, cultural, and economic centers and material distribution centers of the minority areas in Sichuan, Tibet, and Qinghai have been closely connected, improving the lives of the people in these areas. In Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, before the highway was opened to traffic, packhorses and yaks had been the only means of transportation for generations. The transportation capacity was extremely low, and people could not eat salt whenever it rained, and industrial products were even scarcer. After the highway was opened to traffic, people here could buy Shanghai cotton blankets and Guangzhou rubber shoes. The special products produced in this area, such as tea, rice, and camphor, have been transported out of nearly 10 million jin in the few years after the highway was opened to traffic. Automobiles have also transported tractors, harvesters, and various industrial products to this area. Last year, the first mechanized farm and a comprehensive factory including power generation and winemaking were established in this area.

    海陆空运输四通八达
    建设速度远远超过五年计划规定
    交通网年年扩展消除了地理阻隔
    新华社7日讯　新华社记者张超报道：我国海陆空运输事业建设的速度远远超过五年计划的规定。到今年6月底为止，我国新铺的铁路长达四千七百多公里，超过五年计划指标四百多公里。新建和修复码头的吞吐能力六百八十余万吨，其中海港的吞吐能力超过五年计划指标26％，并且开辟了三十六条共长二万浬的海洋航线。空中运输航线发展到二万多公里，比第一个五年计划规定指标多二千公里。五年计划期间中央投资新修公路一万零一百公里，去年年底已提前完成。到今年6月底，公路通车里程比1952年增加了将近一倍。
    经过前几年的建设，我国旧有的交通运输事业的面貌已发生了根本变化。
    在铁路方面，旧中国遗留下来的半身不遂的状况已经改变。我国旧有铁路都是英、德、法、比和日本帝国主义投资修建的。为了便于他们的经济侵略，线路都集中在沿海和平原地区，面积约占全国60％左右的西南和西北地区，铁路只占全国的6％左右。各帝国主义国家的铁路标准都不一样，这些铁路过去被帝国主义分管着，成为它们的吸血管。在第一个五年计划的前四年里，我国已铺铁路四千多公里，平均每年一千公里左右。旧中国从修第一条铁路到1949年全国解放时止，经过满清和国民党两个政府，在七十一年里共修铁路两万多公里，平均每年修二百八十多公里铁路。以每年修路里程相比，五年计划前四年修铁路的速度，相当于旧中国修建铁路速度的三倍以上。而前四年的铁路大都修建在艰险的山区。曾打通二千公尺长的秦岭隧道，修成宝成铁路，让火车开进天府之国——四川；削平了乌鞘岭，变天堑为通途，和陇海铁路相接的兰新铁路部分通车，使西北和祖国消除了地理上的隔阂。今年新建的包兰铁路，现在穿过著名的腾格里沙漠东部的大沙山，北段的铺轨工程已越过离开包头一百多公里的西山咀，明年在银川接轨以后，西北和内蒙两大工业区就会连接起来。在新建的同时，还改建了旧有铁路，在工业多的地区铺设了复线。1953年以来，我国在这些铁路线上增添了五百多台自制大型机车，因而现在运送的货物量比1953年增长了将近一倍。
    民用航空事业方面的变化更为突出。1953年开始建立了我国有史以来的第一支专业飞行队伍。现在，这支专业飞行队伍，在工农业生产战线上已发生了巨大的威力。武汉长江大桥、第一汽车厂和玉门油矿有许多重要的生产建设材料，就是飞机运送的。探矿飞机曾经探出了五十多处矿藏。测量飞机测量了黄河地区水源灌溉的水源和地形。灭蝗飞机在前两年里曾为农民扑灭了三百多万亩的蝗虫。今年，还用飞机开始运送蚕种、树苗和为居民扑灭蚊虫等等。新疆阿勒泰和乌鲁木齐去年通航以后，飞机越过沙漠，到阿勒泰运鱼虾和药材，阿勒泰的鱼虾再不烂作肥料，人民生活也改善了。
    我国虽然二十八年前就有了民航运输，但一直都为帝国主义和官僚资本所操纵。那时候，飞机只是被反动统治者用作掠夺人民财物和从事投机活动的工具。在全国解放前夕，就是这些少得可怜的飞机和机场，也被他们溃逃时破坏了。人民政权接管的飞机没有一架可以飞行。而现在，我国已经有一个广大的空中运输网。以北京为中心，北到齐齐哈尔，南到海南岛，西到新疆，东到上海三十八个重要工矿城市都已接连起来。前年，飞行员们在拔海七千公尺高的“世界屋脊”上空飞行成功。从北京到拉萨陆上交通要走一个多月，现在只需飞行几个小时就到了。第一个五年计划里，我国还开辟了中国到越南，中国到缅甸等九条国际航线，并和这些国家进行了联运。前几年里，我国增加的飞机按载重吨位计算，比1952年增长了80％以上。
    在水运方面，我国强大的海河运输事业已在斗争中成长起来。在全国解放当时，各个主要港口，受到国民党军队的严重破坏。他们并在港口扔下了大量爆炸物和障碍物；劫走了达六十万吨的船舶。解放初期，蒋军还不断用飞机来轰炸，破坏和封锁海上运输。但是，现在以上海、大连、广州三港为中心，连接天津、秦皇岛、青岛等几十个港口的海上运输网已经形成。海船可以在三十六条航线上运送货物。最近还开辟了从大连到南京、九江、马鞍山等十三个江海直达航线，使运输效率空前提高。沿海大连、秦皇岛等七大港口进行了改建和恢复，载重万吨的船舶都可以进港。天津塘沽港原来三千吨载重的船也不能靠岸，1953年扩建以后，先后有十六个国家的载重万吨的轮船可以靠岸装卸。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国还新建了湛江港，这是我国有史以来第一次自己建设的近代化港口，它全部建成后，每年可以吞吐物资四百六十万吨。去年第一期主要工程完成后，可以同时停泊两艘载重万吨巨轮的深水港，已经开航。长江和其他内河进行了整治与航标改革，使全国内河通航里程比1952年增加八千多公里。川江已全线实行夜航。现在，行驶在海河船舶载重吨位，比1953年以前增加了80％，比解放初期增加了两倍多。
    前几年公路建设的结果，大大改变了少数民族地区的交通状况。解放初期，通车的公路有七万多公里，占中国面积65％的少数民族地区，公路极少，更没有汽车。最近三四年中，我国除了新修的公路外还修复通车公路十万多公里，相当于国民党统治的三十五年中通车的公路里程。这些公路中有不少是在少数民族地区。工程巨大的康藏公路、青藏公路通车以后，把四川、西藏、青海少数民族地区的政治、文化、经济中心和物资集散地，紧密地集合起来。使这些地区人民的生活得到了改善。云南西双版纳地区，在公路通车以前，祖祖代代驮马和牦牛是唯一的交通工具，运力极低，每逢雨天人们就吃不上盐，工业用品更缺乏。公路通车以后，这里的人可以买到上海棉毯、广州的胶鞋。这个地区产的茶叶、稻谷、樟脑等特产，在公路通车后的几年中，运出了近一千万斤。汽车还给这个地区运送了拖拉机、收割机和各种工业用品。这个地区去年建立了第一个机械农场和包括发电、酿酒的综合性工厂。
