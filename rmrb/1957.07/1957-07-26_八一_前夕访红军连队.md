    Visiting Red Army Companies on the Eve of "August 1st"
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Xuezeng
    On the eve of "August 1st," this reporter visited two Red Army companies on the green treasure island.
    These two companies, the First Company and the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are now stationed on Hainan Island in southern China. These are two companies with a glorious fighting history. The First Company participated in the Nanchang Uprising under the leadership of Marshal Zhu De; the Second Company was a company from the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao. They followed Chairman Mao and Marshal Zhu De to join forces in Jinggangshan and were incorporated into the First Company and Second Company of the First Battalion, Tenth Division, Twenty-eighth Regiment of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. It is said that these two companies were also the pilot units for Chairman Mao's formulation of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention."
    For thirty years, these two companies have fought side by side, supporting each other. They participated in the fierce battles to smash the Kuomintang's five encirclement and suppression campaigns. On the Long March of 25,000 li, they were the pioneers, known as the two sharp knives of the regiment. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation, they always stood side by side at the forefront of the struggle. They participated in the world-shaking Battle of Pingxingguan, and then fought for many years in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui and the border area of Jiangsu and Anhui, severely打击 (dǎ jī - hit hard/strike) the Japanese, puppet, and stubborn armies. After the Japanese surrender, they advanced into Northeast China side by side, fighting bravely on the Northeast battlefield for more than three years. Then, they followed the main force into the pass and fought all the way to the south of the motherland, guarding the motherland's coastline.
    For thirty years, they have often marched on the same road, camped in the same village, and jointly undertaken the same arduous combat tasks. Sometimes the First Company was the main attacker, and the Second Company cooperated; sometimes the Second Company opened a breakthrough, and the First Company followed behind. During the Long March, when crossing the Dadu River, the First Company cooperated with the Second Company in the attack. When attacking Lazikou, the First Company climbed the most dangerous cliff, defeated the enemy, and covered the successful passage of the Second Company and other fraternal units. In July 1939, the First Company and the Second Company were jointly attacked by the enemy and puppets in northeastern Anhui. The enemy deployed more than 4,000 people in the cornfields at night, as well as a Japanese rapid response unit, attempting to wipe out the First Company and the Second Company in one fell swoop. However, the First Company and the Second Company attacked from both sides respectively, engaging in fierce bayonet fighting with the enemy, and completely annihilated an entire Japanese company. In the end, the First Company and the Second Company all safely transferred. This was a significant victory at the time. The achievement of this victory was inseparable from the good cooperation between these two companies.
    For thirty years, the glorious title of Red Army Company has always encouraged these two companies to move forward bravely. During the war, as soon as it was mentioned that we were the Red Army Company from Jinggangshan, or that we were the company personally cultivated by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the soldiers were all in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. They could overcome any difficulty, and they would smash any enemy, no matter how tough. In the Chen Daokou battle in northern Jiangsu in 1941, the First Company was tasked with the assault mission. At that time, there were no explosives or artillery. Under the cover of machine guns and grenades, the soldiers used铡刀 (zhá dāo - a type of guillotine-like knife used for cutting straw) to cut through three barbed wire fences and advance bravely. A nineteen-year-old Communist Party member, with his intestines exposed, continued to fight while holding his stomach. Most of the cadres were wounded or killed, and the situation was very critical. At this time, someone said, "We are the Red First Company from Jinggangshan, we can't let Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu down." As a result, an invincible force was generated, and the soldiers automatically organized themselves to break through a bloody path, defeat the enemy, and achieve victory.
    In their decades of combat life, the First Company and the Second Company have made outstanding achievements and have been awarded heroic titles many times. A large number of combat heroes and meritorious models have emerged. Now, in their company clubs, the various award banners hanging, and the many pictures and articles introducing the deeds of heroes that are posted, are records of the combat paths they have experienced.
    Now, both companies live in newly built barracks nestled against the mountains and near the water, standing side by side. The barracks are surrounded by flowers, fruits, and vegetables. In front of the barracks are fish ponds and pigsties dug by the soldiers. The officers and soldiers cherish the honor of their companies very much. In the dormitories of the First Company and the Second Company, there is an empty bed, which is not slept in all year round, but on which are placed quilts, mattresses, and pillows, and mosquito nets are hung. People told me that the bed in the First Company is for Marshal Zhu De, and the bed in the Second Company is for Marshal Lin Biao, because Marshal Lin Biao once served as the company commander of the Second Company. In the roster of the First Company, the first name is Zhu De; in the roster of the Second Company, the first name is Lin Biao. When calling the roll, whenever these two people's names are called, the soldiers of the First Squad of the First Company will stand at attention and say, "Zhu De is away on official business." The soldiers of the First Squad of the Second Company will report, "Lin Biao has requested leave for something."
    When I walked into the station of these two companies, I saw the soldiers were engaged in intensive military training. In recent years, they have made amazing progress in tactics and technology and have become companies with modern warfare capabilities. In last year's military training alone, the First Company saw the emergence of seven excellent shooting squads and sixty-seven excellent shooters. The company's overall shooting evaluation and political test were also excellent, and they have been commended by higher authorities three times. The soldiers told me that they are studying and training diligently because defending the socialist construction of the motherland requires skills. The soldiers of the "Red First Company" cannot let Chairman Mao down.
    On the road to regularization and modernization, these two companies still maintain the fine traditions of the Red Army era. Soldiers respecting officers and officers caring for soldiers is a characteristic of the People's Army, and it is also a characteristic of these two companies. People remember very clearly that on the Northeast battlefield, where the temperature was forty degrees below zero, a soldier from the Eighth Squad of the Second Company fell ill. The officers and soldiers pulled him forward on a "爬犁 (pá lí - a type of sled)". In order to prevent the patient from being attacked by the severe cold, Company Commander Chen Kejia took off his cotton coat and put it on the patient, while he carried more things on his back and ran to keep warm. In peaceful days, Xiao Shi, the political instructor of the First Company, often used his salary to buy some delicious dishes for the sick soldiers, and personally drew water to bathe, wipe the backs, and change clothes for the seriously ill soldiers, which moved the soldiers to tears. The soldiers unanimously believe that the officers are not only their superiors in terms of职务 (zhí wù - post, job, position), their guides in politics, and their mentors in military affairs, but also their relatives who care for them more than their own brothers in life and emotion.
    The First Company and the Second Company are also consistently outstanding in their work of supporting the government and cherishing the people. The day I arrived was the day after they had finished helping the local agricultural production cooperative build water conservancy projects. The bamboo baskets they had woven themselves for carrying soil up the mountain were still piled in the square, and the iron shovels and picks were still placed at the corners of the barracks. They respect and care for the people everywhere. In the Red Army period, the Second Company was rewarded for its good relations with the military and civilians. On the eve of the liberation of Beijing, the First Company in Huangchangpu, south of Beijing, received from the residents of the garrison area a "万民伞 (wàn mín sǎn - literally 'ten thousand people umbrella,' a gift from the community to a highly respected official as a sign of their appreciation)" and a banner each with the words "Model of Observing Discipline" because of their strict adherence to mass discipline. This time, when helping the local people build water conservancy projects, no cadre or soldier was not an activist, so much so that the leadership could not find a particularly good person to commend, because everyone was very good.

    “八一”前夕访红军连队
    新华社记者　徐学增
    “八一”前夕，记者在绿色的宝岛上，访问了两个红军连队。
    这两个连队是中国人民解放军某部的第一连和第二连，现在守卫在祖国南方的海南岛上。这是两个具有光荣战斗历史的连队。一连在朱德元帅率领下参加过南昌起义；二连是毛主席领导的秋收暴动的一个连队。他们曾经分别跟随毛主席和朱德元帅会师井冈山，并且被编为中国工农红军第四军十师二十八团的一连和二连。据说，这两个连队还是毛主席制订“三大纪律、八项注意”的试点单位。
    三十年来，这两个连队一直并肩战斗，互相支援。他们参加过粉碎国民党五次围剿的严酷战斗。在两万五千里长征的道路上，他们是开路先锋，被称为团里的两把尖刀。在抗日战争和解放战争中，他们始终并肩站在斗争的前列。威震天下的平型关大战，他们参加了，而后，又在苏鲁豫皖四省和苏皖边区转战多年，沉重地打击过日、伪、顽军。日寇投降后，他们并肩挺进东北，在东北战场上奋战三年多，接着，又随大军入关，一直战斗到祖国的南边，守卫在祖国的海防线上。
    三十年来，他们经常在一条路上行军，在一个村里宿营，共同担负着同一个艰巨的战斗任务。有时一连担任主攻，二连配合；有时二连打开了突破口，一连在后面跟进。长征中渡大渡河时，一连配合二连攻击。攻打腊子口时，一连攀登上最险要的悬崖，打垮敌人，掩护着二连和其他兄弟部队胜利通过。1939年7月，一连和二连在皖东北遭到了敌伪联合进攻。敌人夜间在青纱帐布置下四千多人，还有一个日本快速连队，企图一举消灭一连和二连。但是，一连和二连分别从两侧出击，同敌人展开了激烈的白刃战，全歼日寇一个整连。最后，一连和二连还全部安全地转移了。这在当时是一个不小的胜利。这胜利的取得，是同这两个连队配合得好分不开的。
    三十年来，红军连队这个光荣称号一直鼓舞着这两个连队勇敢前进。在战争期间，只要一提到我们是井冈山上下来的红军连，或提到我们是毛主席和朱总司令亲手培养起来的连队，战士们一个个精神百倍，斗志高昂，有了天大的困难也能克服，遇着再硬的敌人也要把它砸垮。1941年，苏北陈道口战斗，一连担任突击任务。那时没有炸药，也没有炮，战士们就在机关枪和手榴弹掩护下，用铡刀砍断了三道铁丝网勇猛前进。一个十九岁的共产党员，肠子打出来了，抱着肚子继续战斗。干部大部伤亡了，情况十分危急。这时，有人说了句：“我们是井冈山上的红一连，不能给毛主席和朱总司令丢脸。”于是一种无敌的力量产生了，战士们自动组织起来冲开一条血路，打垮了敌人，取得了胜利。
    在几十年的战斗生涯中，一连和二连战功卓著，多次荣获英雄称号，涌现了大批的战斗英雄和功臣、模范。现在，在他们连队俱乐部里，挂着的种种奖旗，张贴着的许多介绍英雄的事迹的图片和文章，就是他们所经历过的战斗道路的记录。
    现在，这两个连队都住在并立的两座依山近水的新盖的营房里。营房周围种满了鲜花、瓜果和菜蔬，营房前面还有战士们修挖的鱼塘和猪圈。官兵们是十分珍惜自己连队的荣誉的。一连和二连的宿舍里，各有一个空床铺，终年没有人睡，但上面却放着被、褥、枕头，还挂着蚊帐。人们告诉我，一连那张床铺是朱德元帅的，二连那张床铺是林彪元帅的，因为林彪元帅曾在二连当过连长。在一连的花名册上，第一个名字是朱德；在二连的花名册上，第一个名字是林彪。点名的时候，每当叫到这两个人的名字时，一连一班的战士会立正说：“朱德因公外出。”二连一班的战士便报告说：“林彪有事请假。”
    我走进这两个连队的驻地时，见战士们正在进行紧张的军事训练。近几年来，他们在战术和技术上都有了惊人的进展，成为具有现代战争能力的连队了。单是一连在去年军事训练中就涌现出七个射击优胜班，六十七个优等射手。射击总评和政治测验全连也是优秀，先后受到上级三次嘉奖。战士们告诉我，他们勤学苦练的劲头很大，因为保卫祖国的社会主义建设需要本领呀，“红一连”的战士不能给毛主席丢人。
    在向正规化、现代化前进的道路上，这两个连队仍然保持着过去红军时代的优良传统。士兵尊重军官，军官爱护士兵是人民军队的特色，也是这两个连队的特色。人们记得很清楚，在零下四十度的东北战场上，二连八班有个战士生了病，官兵们用“爬犁”拉着他踏雪前进。为了不使病人受到严寒的侵袭，连长陈克家把自己身上的棉衣脱下来，盖在病人身上，自己却多背上一些东西奔跑御寒。在和平的日子里，一连政治指导员晓时也常用自己的薪金买一些可口的菜给病员吃，并且亲自打水给重病员洗澡、擦背、换衣服，感动得战士流了泪。战士们一致认为，军官们不仅在职务上是他们的上级，在政治上是他们的引路人，在军事上是他们的导师，而且在生活上、感情上还是他们比亲兄弟还关心他们的亲人。
    一连和二连在拥政爱民工作上也是一贯出色的好的连队。我到的这天，正是他们帮助当地农业生产合作社兴修水利完工的第二天。他们上山砍竹自编的挑土用的筐子还堆在广场上，铁锹、洋镐还放在营房墙角下。他们处处尊重和爱护人民。在红军时期，二连因军民关系好受过奖励。北京解放前夕，一连在北京城南黄厂铺因群众纪律严明，获得过驻地居民赠送的“万民伞”和“遵守纪律好榜样”锦旗各一面。这次帮助当地人民兴修水利没有一个干部和战士不是积极分子，甚至使得领导上无法找出一个特别好的人来进行表扬，因为大家都很好。
