To the Editor:

In the speech given by Lin Han Da, Vice Minister of Education, at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published on page 2 of the People's Daily on May 22nd, regarding the issue of eliminating illiteracy, he said: "The rash advance is mainly reflected in the planning. The task of completing in seven years was said to be completed in three or five years, which is actually armchair strategizing. By the time of spring plowing, the illiteracy elimination work was already declining, but the People's Daily still published an editorial to correct the blind rash advance. Where did the People's Daily editorial come from? Even the Minister of Education didn't know. Who can command the Ministry of Education?" We have a few questions that are not clear, namely, when was this People's Daily editorial published? What was the actual situation of the illiteracy elimination work at that time? What is the basis for the People's Daily's criticism? Do education-related editorials in the People's Daily have to be reviewed by the Minister of Education before they can be published? Please give us a reply.

Zhang Peng

Comrade Zhang Peng:

The People's Daily editorial mentioned by Lin Han Da, Vice Minister of Education, refers to the editorial "It is Necessary to Oppose Conservatism and Impatience" published on June 20, 1956. This editorial was mainly written to address a general trend of impatience and rash advance in various national undertakings after the upsurge of opposing right-leaning conservatism, especially in agriculture and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This editorial also touched on the problems in the rural illiteracy elimination work at that time. The editorial said: "The central government's requirement was to basically eliminate illiteracy among urban and rural residents in five to seven years, but in some provinces it became four or five years, and in some counties it became three years. The further down, the shorter the time was set. ... Individual places even set up literacy posts and roadside literacy stations, forcing the masses to learn to read."

The phenomenon of impatience and rash advance that once occurred in the illiteracy elimination work mentioned in the editorial did indeed exist at that time. According to the understanding of this newspaper's editorial department, at that time, the illiteracy elimination plans in many places were generally too high and too urgent, and some places even experienced coercion and commandism in the illiteracy elimination work. This situation was reflected in reports from various places and reports in local newspapers. It was absolutely necessary to criticize and correct this phenomenon.

The Teacher's Newspaper's editorial on June 8, 1956, entitled "Two Deviations in Illiteracy Elimination Work," stated: "Another deviation is impatience and greed for quick results, 'Illiteracy elimination first.'" Zhang Xi Ruo, Minister of Education, also said in his speech at the Third Session of the National People's Congress in June 1956: "Recently, varying degrees of impatience and rash advance have emerged in various places, which is particularly serious in the elimination of illiteracy." The Teacher's Newspaper's editorial and Minister Zhang Xi Ruo's speech also mentioned the phenomenon of shortening the years for illiteracy elimination plans at each level and coercion and commandism. The Teacher's Newspaper's editorial was twelve days earlier than this newspaper's editorial, and the date of Zhang Xi Ruo's speech at the National People's Congress was the same as the date of publication of this newspaper's editorial.

As for whether it is correct that "by the time of spring plowing, the illiteracy elimination work was already declining," and this newspaper's editorial still criticized the impatience and rash advance in the illiteracy elimination work? Our view is: at that time, on the one hand, the phenomenon of impatience and rash advance in the illiteracy elimination work from top to bottom was an objective fact. On the other hand, after the start of spring plowing and busy farming, it was necessary to put forward and correct this phenomenon, so that agricultural production and illiteracy elimination work could be well arranged, so as not to affect agricultural production, the rest and health of farmers due to emphasizing "illiteracy elimination first," and to prevent the phenomenon of coercion and commandism from developing further. Of course, since the start of spring plowing in 1956, illiteracy elimination work has indeed been somewhat relaxed in some areas, and the number of people participating in literacy learning has decreased compared with the winter of 1955, and it seems that illiteracy elimination work "was declining." However, this is a normal phenomenon after the start of busy farming. Illiteracy elimination work must adapt to this situation, implement the principle of "learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and stop learning when very busy" according to the different seasons of farming, and proceed on a positive, steady and reliable basis. This is the purpose of this newspaper's criticism.

Another point of Lin Han Da's opinion is that "the rash advance is mainly reflected in the planning. The task of completing in seven years was said to be completed in three or five years, which is actually armchair strategizing." Is this the case? In fact, some of the accelerated and enlarged illiteracy elimination plans at that time had already begun to be implemented, that is to say, it had already affected the actual work, and the phenomenon of coercion and commandism in illiteracy elimination work in some places was related to this. It is not in line with the actual situation to say that all the illiteracy elimination work plans in various places at that time had no impact on the actual work at all and were "armchair strategizing." Moreover, since it is an inappropriate plan, even before it is implemented or not fully implemented, it needs to be criticized and corrected in a timely manner, so as to reduce the losses in actual work.

Regarding the question of whether all editorials on education must be sent to the Minister of Education for review before they can be published, our answer is this: Some of our comments are sent to the responsible comrades of the competent departments for their opinions, and they have also given great help to the editorial department. However, this does not mean that all the comments published by the editorial department must be reviewed by the responsible comrades of the competent departments. If the newspaper editorial department deems it necessary, it can solicit the opinions of relevant parties, but it can also independently and responsibly publish comments on a certain aspect of work.

Finally, regarding the "9 million people who eliminated illiteracy in 1956" mentioned in Lin Han Da's speech, this newspaper did not mention this figure in this editorial.

### 关于林汉达对本报社论意见的说明

1957-07-27
第7版()
专栏：答读者问

    关于林汉达对本报社论意见的说明编辑同志：
    5月22日人民日报第二版刊登的教育部副部长林汉达在中共中央统战部召开的民主党派和无党派民主人士座谈会上的发言，其中谈到扫除文盲工作的问题时说：“冒进主要表现在规划上，把七年完成的任务说成三年五年，实际上是纸上谈兵。到春耕的时候扫盲工作本来已是在走下坡路了，人民日报还发表了一篇社论，纠正盲目冒进。人民日报社论那里来的？教育部的部长都不知道。谁能够指挥教育部呢？”这里，我们有几个问题不大清楚，即人民日报这篇社论是什么时候发表的？当时扫除文盲工作的实际状况是怎样的？人民日报的批评究竟有何根据？人民日报有关教育方面的社论是不是都要教育部部长看过以后，才能发表？请给我们一个答复。
    张鹏张鹏同志：
    教育部副部长林汉达在发言中提到的人民日报的社论，是指发表于1956年6月20日“要反对保守主义，也要反对急躁情绪”的社论。这篇社论主要是针对在反对右倾保守主义特别是农业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮到来以后，国家各项事业中普遍发生的一种急躁冒进偏向来写的。在这篇社论中，也谈到了当时农村扫除文盲工作中的问题。社论说：“中央的要求本来是要在五年至七年内基本上扫除城市和农村居民中的文盲，但到某些省里就成了四年和五年，到某些县里成了三年，愈到下面时间定得愈短。……个别的地方甚至设立识字岗、拦路识字站，强迫群众认字。”
    社论中提到扫除文盲工作一度发生的急躁冒进现象，当时确实是存在的。据本报编辑部的了解，当时许多地方扫除文盲规划一般都偏高偏急，有些地方在扫除文盲工作中并且发生了强迫命令现象。这种情况在各地的报告、地方报纸的报道当中，都有所反映。批评和纠正这种现象是完全必要的。
    教师报1956年6月8日以“扫盲工作中的两种偏向”为题的社论中就说：“另一种偏向是急躁贪快，‘扫盲第一’。”教育部部长张奚若在1956年6月在全国人民代表大会第三次会议的发言中也说：“最近以来，各地却又产生了程度不同的急躁冒进情绪，在扫除文盲工作方面表现得尤为严重。”教师报的社论和张奚若部长的发言，也都提到了各地计划扫除文盲的年限逐层短缩以及强迫命令等现象。教师报的社论早于本报的社论十二天，张奚若在全国人代大会的发言和本报社论发表的日期相同。
    至于说“到春耕的时候扫盲工作本来已是在走下坡路了”，本报社论还批评扫盲工作急躁冒进，这是否对呢？我们的看法是：当时一方面扫除文盲工作从上到下有急躁冒进的现象是客观存在的事实，另一方面春耕农忙开始之后，提出并纠正这种现象，使农业生产和扫除文盲工作很好的安排，不致因强调“扫盲第一”而影响农业生产，影响农民的休息和健康，不再让强迫命令的现象发展，也是需要的。当然，从1956年春耕开始之后，扫除文盲工作在有的地区确有所放松，参加识字学习的人数比1955年冬季有所下降，看来扫盲工作“是在走下坡路了”。但是，这正是农忙开始以后的一种通常现象。扫除文盲工作必须适应这种状况，根据农事闲忙不同的季节，贯彻“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙停学”的原则，在积极而稳妥可靠的基础上进行。本报批评的目的就在这里。
    林汉达的另一点意见说，“冒进主要表现在规划上，把七年完成的任务说成三年五年，实际上是纸上谈兵。”事实是不是这样呢？实际上当时有些地方加快加大了的扫盲计划已经开始付诸实行，也就是说，已对实际工作发生了影响，某些地方扫除文盲工作中所发生的强迫命令现象与此有关。把当时各地的扫除文盲工作计划一律说成完全没有对实际工作发生影响的“纸上谈兵”，是不符合实际情况的。而且，既然是不妥当的计划，即使在它未付诸实行或未完全付诸实行以前，也需要及时加以批评纠正，这样就可减少实际工作中的损失。
    关于教育方面的社论是否都送教育部长看过以后，才能发表的问题，我们的答复是这样的：我们有些评论是送主管部门的负责同志征求意见的，他们也曾给编辑部很大的帮助。但是，这并不是说，编辑部发表的一切评论都必须经过主管部门的负责同志看。报纸编辑部认为有必要，可以征求有关方面的意见，但是，也完全可以独立负责地发表关于某一方面工作的评论。
    最后，林汉达发言中所提到的“1956年扫除文盲九百万人”，本报在这篇社论中并没有提到这个数字。　本报编辑部
