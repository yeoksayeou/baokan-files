    ·Yuan Xing's Speech·
    In the past, opening the door meant seeing only barren mountains and rocks; now, it's a boundless expanse of trees and orchards. In the past, there wasn't even a road suitable for walking; now, we've opened up smooth roads that reach in all directions. In the past, neither people nor crops had water to drink; now, we can go without rain for years and it won't affect us. Whoever says farmers' lives haven't improved is just telling blatant lies.

    Recently, we farmers in the mountainous areas were shocked and angered to read the reactionary statements of the bourgeois rightists in the newspapers! In order to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, they dared to disregard the facts and maliciously fabricate rumors, saying that the current countryside is a complete mess, that agricultural cooperatives have no advantages, that farmers' lives are very hard, and not as good as before liberation, etc. As a farmer from the mountainous area, I want to talk about the tremendous changes that have taken place in the lives of farmers in our area under the leadership of the Communist Party, based on the facts I am familiar with, to compare with the rightists' remarks and see what they are really up to.

    My home is in Hei'nao Village, Shahe County, Hebei Province. Anyone who had been to our village before liberation will never forget the difficult situation we were in. Now there are a total of twenty-six households with ninety-four people in the village. The small village is located on steep mountain cliffs, surrounded by barren mountains and endless rocks. People say it's a "place where even rabbits don't shit," and there wasn't even a road suitable for people and livestock to walk on. The people who lived here had never had enough water to drink and never washed their faces clean for generations, because there was no water source and they only relied on drinking the accumulated rainwater. In times of drought, people's throats would practically catch fire, and a sip of water was worth more than an ounce of gold. At that time, everyone went to carry water from more than ten miles away in the mountains, and no one would drink more than a sip besides for meals. As for the crops, they had to rely on fate; without rain, they wouldn't see a drop of water. The village has a total of 310 mu of land, but most of it belonged to the landlords at the foot of the mountain. The life of the people in Hei'nao Village was like the bare mountain, with nothing. Every household relied on renting land from the landlords, and they lived a life worse than cattle and horses, with every drop of sweat and every tear. In times of famine, the whole village, in groups, with their children and families, went to other places to flee the famine. Some wandered away and were never heard from again, and some starved to death in other towns. During the famine in 1942, the whole village (33 households) starved to death more than 50 people, five families were wiped out, and two families fled the famine and never returned. In the past, the grain harvested from the fields, after paying rent to the landlord, was only some bran and a handful of vegetables. After eating this meal, they worried about the next. Before the incident, only four households could afford a catty of meat for the New Year, and the remaining 29 households couldn't even smell meat. There were no mats on the beds, the clothes on their bodies didn't cover them properly, a shoe weighed four or five catties, and four or five people had to share a quilt. The whole village had never raised a single sheep, nor had they ever raised a single pig. Mentioning the hardships suffered at that time, tears couldn't be stopped, and it could never be forgotten!

    But, this disaster-prone small mountain village has turned over, its luck has changed, and it has changed greatly.

    The great land reform liberated us from the oppression of the landlords, and we were transformed from slaves of the land into masters of the land. We worked diligently and produced hard on our own land, and our lives got better day by day. Of course, this was not a one-step ascent to heaven, but a step-by-step journey relying closely on the education and leadership of the Communist Party. In 1951, our village established a primary agricultural cooperative on the basis of mutual aid teams, and production took a big step forward. In 1953, we achieved a bumper year, and we sold 36,000 catties of surplus grain to the state alone. In 1955, we transformed into an advanced cooperative, and in 1956, we merged with two neighboring small villages to develop into the current advanced agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry diversified economy cooperative with 54 households and 185 people.

    Since the establishment of the cooperative, we have followed the Party's instructions to run the cooperative diligently and thriftily, develop a diversified economy, carry out water conservancy, and improve agricultural technology. In a very short period of time, we have completely changed our barren and poor mountain village, and the hard days are gone forever.

    In the past, what we saw when we opened the door was all barren mountains and rocks, but now, it is a boundless expanse of trees and orchards. In the past, there wasn't even a road suitable for walking, but now, relying on the collective strength, we have opened up smooth roads that reach in all directions from the mountains to the outside, from the top of the mountain to the bottom. There is a large cart road about fifteen miles long on the mountain ridge, which was completed by using spare time and spending three years.

    In the past, neither people nor crops had water to drink, but now we have built a large water storage pool with a circumference of 25 zhang, in addition to eight small reservoirs and forty-two wells. We won't be affected by a few years of no rain.

    In the past, the land on our mountain cliffs was in small patches, like a child's diaper. A big wind would blow it away, and a mountain flood would wash it away. Now, we have learned how to maintain water and soil, building stone dams, repairing water storage embankments, drainage ditches, controlling mountain gullies, planting trees...etc. Neat terraced fields are arranged layer by layer from the bottom of the mountain to the top.

    In the past, our whole village only had seven small livestock, but now we raise 68 livestock, and seven young livestock were born this year; in the past, we didn't have a single sheep, but now we raise 710 (including 270 lambs born this year); in the past, we couldn't afford to raise a pig, but now we have 132 (including piglets), with an average of more than two per household. The rightist Ge Peiqi said that farmers are unwilling to raise pigs, which is completely a blatant lie and a malicious distortion of the facts.

    Because more livestock are raised, more fertilizer is accumulated. In the past, each mu of land was only fertilized with ten dan of grass fertilizer, but now each mu can be fertilized with 150 dan; in the past, each mu of land could only harvest 90 jin of grain, but now the average yield per mu has reached 325 jin, which is more than three times higher than in the past. In 1956, the Hei'nao Village production team alone harvested 81,000 jin of grain. After deducting 11,000 jin sold to the state and 17,360 jin reserved for seed, feed, public welfare funds, etc., each person still received 560 jin.

    We have not only developed agriculture and animal husbandry, but also developed forestry based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, and cultivated fruit trees and Vitex. Since 1955, we have started planting trees and making forests, and cultivating Vitex slopes. Up to now, we have afforested 5,000 mu and planted more than 50,000 fruit trees. In 1956, we harvested 220,000 persimmons, 7,000 jin of apples, and 3,000 jin of jujubes. Together with walnuts and plums, the total income was more than 2,200 yuan. We harvested 40,000 jin of Vitex, with an income of more than 1,500 yuan. In addition, we also raised 35 boxes of bees (including 25 boxes added this year) and 40 silkworm mats, and the income is also very high.

    In order to increase the income of the cooperative members and solve the pocket money for the cooperative members, we also advocate operating family sideline occupations, stipulating that each year the cooperative members are left with one month of free production time to engage in family sideline occupations. In 1956, the sideline occupations such as fruit trees, silkworms, and bees operated by individual cooperative members totaled more than 3,770 yuan for the entire cooperative (including 54 households in Hei'nao, Sandao Ling, and Erdao Ling villages), with an average of about 70 yuan per household.

    Due to the development of a diversified economy, the income of the cooperative has increased, and the lives of the cooperative members have also been greatly improved accordingly. Comparing the current life with that of ten years ago, it can really be said that one is heaven and the other is earth, and the changes are really too great.

    In the old society, which farmer in Hei'nao Village didn't swallow chaff and eat vegetables every day? Where would people get a penny? But now, every family has surplus grain, and every household has savings. Taking last year as an example, the average income per household was 350 yuan and 18 fen (excluding the income from individual sideline occupations of cooperative members). Even Jia Fuxin, a "Five-Guarantee" household, is living a prosperous life and has also invested in the cooperative. In the past, people couldn't get pork to eat, but now, every New Year and festival, the cooperative must slaughter pigs and sheep. Last Spring Festival, we slaughtered four pigs and five sheep together; in the past, which young woman wore printed cloth? But now, no matter how many cloth tickets are issued, they are not enough, and no kind of printed cloth is beautiful enough; in the past, who in the mountain gully used thermos bottles, felt blankets, and rain boots? But now everyone buys them, every family has them, and no one finds them rare anymore. As for the bedding, you can no longer see the kind of shabby appearance of the past.

    Only we who have suffered can know better than anyone where this change came from. We can never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led us to turn over and pointed us to a bright and happy road; it was the Party and Chairman Mao who taught us to organize, complete cooperativization, develop production, and increase income; without the Party, we would not have today's life, without socialism.

    The rightists want to abolish the leadership of the Party, we will not allow it; they want to oppose socialism, we will not allow it; they want us to be slaves again, we will resolutely not agree!

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. The cooperative members of Hei'nao Village resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. We are full of confidence to strive for a bumper harvest this year; we will continue to develop agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production according to plan, and run our cooperative even better.

    多灾多难的小山村变成丰衣足食的安乐乡
    ·元兴的发言·
    过去，推开门看见的全是一片荒山乱石，现在是一眼望不到边的树木果林；过去，连一条便于行走的道路都没有，现在，开辟了四通八达的平坦的道路；过去，我们人和庄稼没有吃水的地方，现在几年不下雨也干不着我们了。谁说农民生活没改善，都是睁着眼说瞎话。
    近些日子，我们山区的农民，从报纸上看到资产阶级右派分子的反动言论，很吃惊，很气愤！他们为着反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，反对无产阶级专政，竟敢不顾事实，恶毒地捏造谣言，说现在的农村一团糟，农业社没有优越性，农民生活很苦，赶不上解放以前等等。我是山区的农民，我想根据我自己熟悉的事实，谈一谈我们那里的农民，在共产党领导下，生活上所发生的巨大变化，来对照一下右派分子的言论，看看他们到底是安的什么心思。
    我的家是河北省沙河县的黑碯村。凡是在解放前到过我们那里的人，都忘不了我们所处的那个困难景况。现在全村共有二十六户，九十四口人。小村子坐落在陡峭的山碯上，周围遍地是荒山，无边无际的石头，人们说这是“兔子不拉屎的地方”，连一条便于人行和牲口走的道也没有。住在这里的人，辈辈世世都没喝够水，没洗干净过脸，因为没有水源，只依靠吃积存下来的雨水。遇上干旱的时候，人们的嗓子里简直能冒出火来，一口水赛过一两黄金。那时候，大家都到十多里的山外去担水，除了吃饭以外，谁也不肯多喝一口水。至于庄稼，那只得听天由命，不下雨是见不到一滴水的。全村总共有三百一十亩土地，可是大部分属于山下的地主所有。黑碯村的人过的那日子，就像那光秃秃的荒山一样，什么也没有。家家户户靠着租种地主的土地，真是一滴汗，一滴眼泪，过着牛马不如的生活。赶上荒年，全村成群结队、拖儿带女，到外地去逃荒，有的流浪在外没有下落，有的活活饿死在外乡。1942年闹灾荒，全村（三十三户）饿死了五十多口人，有五家绝了户，二户逃荒始终没回来。过去地里打的粮食，除了给地主交租，剩下的也只是一点糠一把菜。吃完这一顿，就愁下一顿。事变以前，除了有四户过年能买得起一斤肉以外，其余二十九户谁也闻不到肉味儿。炕上没有席子铺，身上衣服不遮体，一只鞋有四、五斤重，一条被子要四、五口人合盖。全村从来没有养起一只羊，也从来没养起一口猪。提起那时候所遭受的磨难，真是止不住眼泪，永远也不能忘记呵！
    可是，就是这个多灾多难的小山村，它翻了身，交了运，大大地变了样了。
    伟大的土地改革，把我们从地主的压迫下解放出来，我们由土地的奴隶变成了土地的主人。我们在自己的土地上辛勤劳动，努力生产，生活一天一天地好起来。这自然不是一步登上了天，而是紧紧地依靠着共产党的教育和领导，一步一步地走了过来。一九五一年我们全村在互助组的基础上，成立了初级农业社，生产大大地提高了一步。一九五三年我们争取了个丰收年，光卖给国家的余粮就有三万六千斤。一九五五年转成高级社，一九五六年和邻近的两个小村合并，发展成现在的五十四户一百八十五口人的农林牧多种经济高级社。
    办社以来，我们按着党指示的：勤俭办社，发展多种经济，开展水利，改良农作技术等方针去做，在很短的时间内，就使我们那个荒凉穷困的山村，完全变了样，苦难的日子一去不复返了。
    过去，我们那里，推开门所看见的，全是一片荒山乱石，现在，却是一眼望不到边的树木果林。过去，连一条便于行走的道路都没有，现在我们靠着集体的力量，从山里到山外，从山上到山下，开辟了四通八达的平坦的道路，在山岭上有一条长约十五里的大车路，是利用了农闲时间，花了三年的工夫完成的。
    过去，我们人和庄稼没有吃水的地方，现在修成了一个圆周二十五丈的大型积水池，另外还有八个小水库，四十二眼井。几年不下雨也干不着我们了。
    过去，我们山碯上那些土地，东一小块，西一小块，像小孩的尿布，来阵大风就刮走了，来了山洪就冲没了。现在，我们学会了如何保持水土的办法，垒石堰，修蓄水埝，排水沟，闸山沟，植树……等，整齐的梯田，从山下到山上，一层层地排列着。
    过去，我们全村只有七头小牲口，现在，我们饲养着六十八头牲口，今年还生下了七头小牲口；过去，我们没有一只羊，现在却养着七百一十只（包括今年生小羊二百七十只）；过去我们养不起一口猪，现在却有一百三十二口（包括小猪），每户平均两口还多。右派分子葛佩琦说农民都不愿养猪，这完全是睁着眼说瞎话，恶毒地歪曲事实。
    由于牲畜养的多，积肥也就多起来。过去每亩地只上十担草肥，而现在每亩能上一百五十担；过去每亩地只能收成九十斤粮食，现在平均每亩产量达到三百二十五斤，比过去提高了三倍多。一九五六年仅黑碯村这一个生产队，就打下八万一千斤粮食，除去卖给国家一万一千斤和留粮种饲料公益积金等用粮一万七千三百六十斤以外，每人还分到五百六十斤。
    我们不单是发展了农业和畜牧业，还根据山区的特点发展了林业，培植了果树和荆条。从一九五五年起，我们就动手植树造林，培养荆条坡，到现在已造林五千亩，植果树五万多株，一九五六年我们收成了二十二万个柿子，七千斤苹果，三千斤酸枣，加上核桃、李子，总共收入二千二百多元。割荆条四万斤，收入一千五百多元。除此以外，我们还养了三十五箱蜂（包括今年增加的二十五箱）和四十席蚕，收入也很大。
    为了增加社员的收入，解决社员的零用钱，我们也提倡经营家庭副业，规定每年给社员留下一个月的自由生产时间，从事家庭副业。一九五六年社员个人经营的果树、蚕、蜂等副业，全社（包括黑碯、三道岭、二道岭三个村共五十四户）总共收三千七百七十多元，平均每户七十来元。
    由于发展了多种经济，社里的收入增加了，社员们的生活也相应地得到很大的提高，如拿现在的生活和十年前相比，那真可以说一是天上，一是地下，变化实在太大了。
    在旧社会，黑碯村的农民，哪一家哪一天不吞糠咽菜，人们到哪里去弄一文钱？可是现在，家家有余粮，户户都存款。以去年为例，每户平均收入三百五十元一角八分（社员个人副业收入不计在内），连五保户贾伏心生活上也是富裕的，还向社里投了资。过去人们捞不到猪肉吃，现在每逢过年过节，社里必定杀猪宰羊，去年春节我们就一起杀了四口猪、五只羊；过去年青的妇女谁穿上了花布？可是现在，布票发多少也不够用，什么样的花布也不漂亮了；过去生活在山沟里的人，谁用过暖壶、毛毡、雨鞋？可是现在人人买，家家有，再也不使人稀罕了。至于铺的盖的，再也看不到过去那种破烂样子了。
    只有我们受过苦的人，才比谁都清楚这个变化是怎么来的。我们永远也不能忘记共产党和毛主席，是党和毛主席领导我们翻了身，指给我们一条光明幸福的大路；是党和毛主席教给我们组织起来，完成合作化，发展了生产，增加了收入；没有党，我们就没有今天的生活，没有社会主义。
    右派分子想取消党的领导，我们不允许；他们想反对社会主义，我们不允许，想要我们再作奴隶，我们坚决不答应！
    我完全赞成周总理的政府工作报告。我们黑碯村的社员，坚决地在党领导下走社会主义的道路。我们满怀信心，争取今年大丰收；我们将按着计划，不断地发展农业、畜牧业和林业生产，把我们的社办得更好。
