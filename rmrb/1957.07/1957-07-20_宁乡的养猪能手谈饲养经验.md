    Ningxiang's Pig-Raising Experts Discuss Feeding Experiences
    Xie Juezai
    Several months ago, I went to Ningxiang for an inspection and happened to be there during the county's pig-raising conference. Ningxiang is a well-known county for producing piglets and meat pigs. Since the increase in purchase prices and the reduction in slaughter taxes, farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs has been greatly stimulated. In 1956, the county's pig population reached 500,000, a great achievement, but there were still many shortcomings, such as insufficient experience in collective pig raising, some losses, neglect of private raising by commune members, and some empty pigsties. In order to strengthen the leadership in pig raising, the county established a Pig Production Guidance Committee headed by County Head Zhang Runqing, with a Pig Production Office under it. In the townships, the second secretary or deputy secretary of the general branch was in charge, in the communes, the deputy director was in charge, and in the teams, the deputy captain was in charge, implementing dedicated responsibilities. The participants in this conference were the secretaries in charge of pig raising in each township and several pig-raising experts. They exchanged feeding experiences and formulated a development plan for 1957.
    Farmers are Enthusiastic about Raising Pigs
    At the end of 1956, the county's pig population was more than 227,000. In 1957, the county party committee originally planned to develop the population to 900,000, but the development figures proposed by each township (61 townships in the county) after discussion, totaled more than 1,102,000, with an ending stock of more than 455,000 at the end of the year. The original plan to purchase 50,000 pigs was revised to more than 67,000 at the meeting. The original plan was for an average of more than five jin of meat per person per year, which was revised to fifteen jin at the meeting. In 1956, the total value of live pig production was 12,610,000 yuan, accounting for 34% of the total value of rice production. The average income from pig raising was 62.7 yuan per household and 14.8 yuan per person. In 1957, the planned average income from pig raising was 122 yuan per household and 29.9 yuan per person. Fertilizer accumulation is not included in this calculation. A male or female pig can accumulate seven dan of manure per month, and a fat pig can accumulate five dan of manure per month. Assuming 20 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu, this can provide fertilizer for more than 800,000 mu of land, accounting for more than 65% of the total land area.
    Ningxiang is a place that produces good breeds of pigs, and piglets are sold within the province and even outside the province. The development numbers for pigs are the highest for piglets, reaching more than 789,000. They have accumulated rich experience in raising piglets. The first is breed selection. The standards for sows are: the head and face should be delicate, the temperament should be gentle, the ears should be thin and the mouth should be neat, the hair should be sparse and the skin should be thin, the back should be flat and the hind legs should be straight, the teats should be neat, the neck should be like a lion's, the belly should be like a copper gong, the four legs should have spread hooves, the front should be light and the rear should be heavy, the buttocks should be flat and neat, the tail should be like a loach's, and the teats should be like bamboo roots. There should be more than twelve teats, preferably T-shaped teats, and there should be no small teats (ghost teats), as small teats produce little milk, and piglets that eat from small teats are often starved to death. The standards for boars are: tall, majestic, with a large head, a neat mouth, straight and strong legs, a belly like a horse's, a flat and wide back and waist, and large and uniform testicles. Both boars and sows should be selected from the third to eighth litters.
    Mating is a key factor. It is important to grasp the estrus period of the sow. Generally, for old sows, it is two and a half to three days, and for new sows, it is three to three and a half days. Too early or too late is not good. According to experience, double mating can increase the litter rate, that is, mating twice with the same boar, with an interval of five to six hours, or mating twice with two boars, with an interval of five to fifteen minutes. Inbreeding is prohibited.
    Good Feeding Methods
    After a sow is pregnant, pay attention to its health and prevent it from jumping over fences to avoid injuring the piglets in its belly. Take good care of it when it gives birth. The bedding should be cut short to avoid strangling the piglets. The pigsty should have a suitable temperature and be quiet. Hold each piglet to suckle, which is called "fixing the teat." After fixing the teat, the piglet will always eat from this teat to avoid competition. The sow should be fed better after three months of pregnancy. After giving birth, she should eat soy milk or cooked beans to ensure sufficient milk. Piglets can be weaned at 20 to 25 days old. Feed them three or four times a day with porridge made from white rice or rice beans and wheat bran beans, or hairy tofu (tofu without removing the bean dregs), gradually adding some tender and fresh green vegetables. In this way, the piglets raised are plump, tender, and lively. They can weigh 20 to 30 jin at full moon. The reason why piglets from the Liusha River area are popular is that they are well raised and grow quickly. I saw piglets being transported to the Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Bairuopu, which were generally up to standard, but not of very good quality, and could be improved.
    The selection of meat pigs is generally the same as that of boars and sows. They should have a lion's head, a large frame, thick legs, and be good eaters.
    Feeding methods: When "hanging the frame," less concentrated feed can be given, but it cannot be completely omitted. At this time, bones and meat need to grow. If the feed is too poor, it will be difficult to fatten them later. Do not use too much concentrated feed, otherwise they will grow into "round pigs," hindering their development. Different feeds should be given according to their growth stage.
    "Raising pigs does not require capital, just chop the pig grass into powder"; "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, see if you can find them"; "There is no trick to raising pigs, just keep the sties clean and the swill full." This means that the pig grass should be chopped finely, cooked thoroughly, and mixed well, and the impurities that cannot be eaten should be removed by hand; the temperature should be suitable; the swill should be added while they eat, and the swill of the day should be fed on the same day, and the swill of the next day should be cooked again; pigs of different sizes should not be in the same trough.
    Feeding should be done on time, in quantity, and with quality. The pigsty should be sunny, have good air, be clean, and be whitewashed (with lime water). The pig manure should be separated from the place where the pigs sleep. The comrades who raise pigs say: Some of the things that pigs eat are consumed, and some grow into meat. If you don't know how to raise pigs, feeding them full one meal and starving them the next, and punishing the pigs to live in a water prison, then even if you feed a lot of concentrated feed, it will all be consumed and the pigs will not grow meat, and may even get sick.
    The conference collected old feeding experiences and new feeding experiences after collectivization. It was not just about displaying experiences, but also about studying some principles and improving the experiences. At the meeting, some people advocated feeding pigs with raw feed, which could save firewood, and cited some scientific principles, but it was not adopted by the people at the meeting because it was not in line with their habits.
    Great Potential for Feed
    Pigs must eat well and eat their fill. The development of live pig production must be adapted to the development of feed. Ningxiang has good soil and climate, and the potential for both green feed and concentrated feed is very great. They have conducted in-depth investigations and arrangements for feed. The private plots of commune members that were insufficient have been adjusted, with one fen of land per pig. Land reserved for collective pig raising has been planned for planting, such as the eleven pig farms of the Tanjia Mountain Commune, which divide the land of each pig farm into three cultivation areas: one for planting early Chinese cabbage, Fu Cai, sweet potatoes, etc., one for planting late Chinese cabbage, second-crop buckwheat, radish greens, etc., and one for planting cowpea vegetables, amaranth vegetables, etc. When this area is finished eating, the other area grows up, so that the green feed can be seamlessly connected. They have sent people to Guangdong to collect water hyacinth seeds (comrades from Hubei said: the water hyacinth planted in Hubei last year had a very good harvest.) Plans have also been made for aquatic plants and weeds such as Salvinia natans, water lilies, and water chestnuts. For concentrated feed, in addition to the feed retained by the commune members and the fine bran supplied by the public, sweet potatoes, bean sprouts, taro, potatoes, etc. should be planted as supplements.
    It is worth noting that Ningxiang's pig development this year has increased by 120% compared with last year, and the feed needs to be increased accordingly. Some of the methods of increasing the feed are new, such as planting water hyacinth. Even for advanced pig-raising communes like Tanjia Mountain, this year's plan for collective pig raising is three times larger than last year, with a total of 1,506 heads, including 426 frame pigs and 146 sows, while the reserved land is only 36 mu. Therefore, in addition to self-planting, there is still a shortage of more than 400,000 jin of feed. They will need to collect floating grass and water chestnut grass in Niucheba, Sanxinghu and other places, as well as the water hyacinth to be planted. The land for planting pig grass should be like the vegetable soil in the suburban areas, growing quickly and abundantly. More sweet potatoes and pumpkins should be planted. As long as there is plenty of fertilizer (the fertilizer still comes from the pigs), a mu of sweet potatoes should produce not thousands of jin but tens of thousands of jin. Sweet potato vines are also good green feed. Sweet potato flour is a specialty of Ningxiang, and is better than any bean-made vermicelli. The sweet potato residue after making flour is a good concentrated feed that can be stored for a long time without spoiling, and people can also eat it. Ningxiang also has hairy cowpea beans. According to comrades from Hubei, hairy cowpea beans do not take up land and can be planted by the walls and corners of houses. One plant can pick ten or so jin, and fertile soil can pick twenty or thirty jin. Pigs like to sleep after eating hairy cowpea beans, which is suitable for feeding meat pigs. The Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture bought more than 5,000 jin this year and gave them to farmers as seeds.
    Ningxiang has methods for developing green feed and concentrated feed for pig raising. It is just that at the beginning of the large-scale development, there is still insufficient fertilizer for planting feed, especially for collective pig raising. Due to the large scale, plans are prone to be incomplete and feed is lacking. Therefore, the county's Pig Production Office should pay close attention to feed production and prevent disconnections.
    Found the Experience of Collective Pig Raising
    Ningxiang's experience in collective pig raising was explored from failures. The collective pig raising of the Tanjia Mountain Commune and the Liusha River Commune, for example, both experienced failures and losses, but they were not deterred. They derived the rules for improvement: 1. The person leading the pig raising must be politically strong and care more about collective production than personal production; 2. The labor force must be strong. It is wrong to think that pig raising is light labor that old men and women can do; 3. There must be a series of feeding plans and labor remuneration plans. They selected strong people to be responsible for pig raising, and the commune's management committee regularly went to inspect and guide, and collective pig raising immediately improved. Taking Tanjia Mountain as an example, in addition to solving the feed problem locally and feeding the pigs on time, in quantity, and with quality, they also formulated management methods. They first promoted the "payment based on output system," and then formulated labor quotas, divided all pig-raising work into six categories, and each category was divided into several items, based on the quantity and standards that a medium-level labor force could achieve in one day of loyal work, and determined the work point remuneration for each work item. Some work items with unstable time and quantity, such as drying pigsty grass and finding boars for mating, are paid by the piece; some processes are connected with responsibilities and use comprehensive quotas. Their self-defined table is very detailed, and outsiders cannot understand it immediately. But their enthusiasm has been improved, and pig raising is making money. Commune members who did not previously approve of collective pig raising now say that collective raising is good because it can solve problems that individuals cannot solve and can make a lot of money. People who attended this pig raising conference went to Tanjia Mountain for a visit and said, "After seeing Tanjia Mountain, we have confidence in anything."
    In order to prevent rash advances, Ningxiang only plans to raise 250,000 pigs collectively this year, less than a quarter of the total.
    Pig raising is for growing meat. Sick pigs cannot grow meat, and dead pigs will lose money. Therefore, first, prevent diseases. The method is to pay attention to the hygiene of the pig's environment. The pigsty should have sunlight, ventilation, and be paved with bricks, stones, or wooden boards. Lime water and manure should be regularly sprinkled outside the pen; the feed should be washed clean, cooked thoroughly, and free of impurities. An old man said that his family has been raising sows for sixty years, and there are often dozens of pigs, large and small, and none have died. The reason lies in this. Second, prevent infectious diseases. Now there is a large flow of pigs, and pigs entering the country must be inspected; dead pork cannot be eaten, as there are many examples of pig diseases being transmitted by eating dead meat. Vaccination is necessary when necessary. Third, disseminate effective and easy-to-prepare old prescriptions for treating pig diseases.
    Fat Pigs Raised in the County Government
    "Pigs weigh 300 jin," but the big pigs I saw this time broke this old saying. These are the pigs raised by the Ningxiang County People's Committee, thirteen in total. Three of them are so big that they look like a wall when they stand up. I asked: Are they more than 400 jin of meat each? The comrade who is the messenger and feeder replied: No, but more than 300 jin. One that was slaughtered before the Spring Festival had 600 jin of meat and 110 jin of rendering fat. It seems that the frames of these three pigs are still loose and may grow so large. The pig breed is still local. The pigsty is very clean, with rice straw on the wooden boards, and the manure is in another place. The feeding trough is washed clean. The feeding comrade said: We didn't feed grain, only a little bran and swill from the county government kitchen. The green feed is self-grown.
    Why are some pigs so big, while the pigs supplied to the market are so small? I didn't see any large pork during my trip through Baoding, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha and other places. In Ningxiang, it has always been the practice not to slaughter and sell anything other than large pigs. This time, the purchased pigs I saw weighed only about 150-160 jin each. Some people say: The purchasing station urges them to be sent before the pigs grow up, and their task is to complete the purchase of a certain number of pigs, not a certain weight of meat. Others say: Farmers do not have enough feed and have to sell them before they grow up. Both statements are not sufficient. I think: One big pig is worth several half-grown piglets, with thick meat, more fat, and better taste. Our development of pigs should focus on the quantity of pigs, but also on the quality of pigs. I hope that the Ningxiang County Government's Pig Production Office will not close its doors and be a model for raising big pigs, but will promote the method of raising big pigs so that there are big pigs everywhere.
    Ningxiang's pig-raising conference has been over for more than three months. Recent news: "There is meat to eat in the countryside, and there is no problem with oil." If the average person eats fifteen jin of meat a year, it is equivalent to the past life of a rich peasant. Although hog cholera occurred in Liushahe, Batang, and Xieleqiao in April and May, it has been extinguished after injections of hog cholera serum. It is estimated that the hog plan can be completed. This will not only lay the foundation for the development of pigs next year, but also provide good conditions for agricultural harvest.

    宁乡的养猪能手谈饲养经验
    谢觉哉
    几个月前我到宁乡视察，正碰上开全县的养猪会议。宁乡是出子猪、肉猪有名的县。自收购价格提高、屠宰税降低，大大刺激了农民养猪的积极性。1956年全县养猪达到五十万头，成绩很大，但仍有不少缺点，如集体养猪的经验不够，有的折了本，及忽视社员私养，还有若干空栏户等。为着加强养猪领导，县里成立生猪生产指导委员会由张润清县长领导，下设生猪生产办公室；乡里由总支第二书记或副书记管，社里由副社长管，队里由副队长管，实行专职专责。这次会议的参加者是各乡专管养猪的书记和若干养猪能手，他们交流了饲养经验，制定1957年的发展计划。
    农民有养猪积极性
    1956年年底，全县存栏猪为二十二点七万多头。1957年县委原定发展数为九十万头，会议上各乡（全县六十一个乡）提出的发展数字，经过讨论，共为一百一十点二万多头，年底存栏数为四十五点五万多头。原定派购猪五万头，会议定为六点七万多头。原定全年每人吃肉平均五斤多，会议定为十五斤。1956年全年生猪总产值一千二百六十一万元，占稻谷总产值34％；养猪收入平均每户六十二点七元，每人平均十四点八元。1957年计划每户平均养猪收入一百二十二元，每人二十九点九元。积肥还不计算在内。一头公母猪，每月积七担粪，一头肥猪每月积五担粪，以每亩施肥二十担算，可供八十多万亩田的肥料，占总田亩65％以上。
    宁乡是出良种猪的地方，子猪销行省内至省外，猪的发展数字中以子猪为最多，共达七十八点九万多头。他们积有养子猪的丰富经验。首先是选种，母猪的标准：头面要清秀，性情要温和，耳薄嘴巴齐，稀毛又薄皮，背平后脚直，奶子要整齐，狮颈铜锣肚，四支要散蹄，前轻后重，屁股平齐，泥鳅尾，竹根奶等。奶子要有十二个以上，最好是丁字奶，不要有小奶子（鬼奶子），小奶子奶水少，吃小奶子的子猪常被饿死。公猪的标准是：高大、威武、头大、嘴齐、四支直而有劲、肚如马腹，背腰平宽、睾丸大而均匀。公母猪都要在三胎至八胎内挑选。
    交配是个关键，要掌握母猪的发情期，一般老母猪是两天半到三天，新母猪是三天到三天半，早了迟了都不好。依据经验，双重交配可以使产子率提高，即同一公猪交两次，相隔五—六小时，或两头公猪配两次，相隔五—十五分钟。禁止近亲交配。
    良好的饲养方法
    母猪怀孕后要注意它的健康，不可让它跳栏，免伤害肚内子猪。产子时要伺候得好，垫草要切短，免缠死小猪；猪栏要温度适宜，要安静，下一只捧一只去吃奶叫做“定奶”。定奶以后子猪即长吃这个奶，免得争。母猪怀孕三个月后就要喂得好些，产子后要吃豆浆或煮熟的豆子，使奶汁充足。子猪出生二十至二十五天便可开食，每天喂三次或四次用白米或饭豆、麦湾豆煮的粥，或毛豆腐（没有滤去豆渣的豆腐）逐渐加点嫩鲜青菜。这样，养出的子猪，肥嫩、活泼。满月时可有二十斤到三十斤重。流沙河一带的子猪之被欢迎就是因为它养得好、肯长。我在白箬铺看到运往苗族自治州的子猪，一般是合乎标准的，但还不是很好的质量，还可以提高。
    肉猪体格的选择，与公母猪大体相同，要狮子头、架子大、脚腿粗壮、会吃食等。
    饲养的方法：吊架子时可以少喂精饲料，但不可一点不喂，这时，要长骨架也要长肉，喂得太不好，以后就难长肥；也不要用精饲料太多，否则就长成“团团猪”，妨碍其发展。要根据其生长时期给以不同的饲料。
    “养猪不要本，猪草切成粉”；“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”；“养猪没巧、只要栏干潲饱”。这就是说猪草要斩得细、煮得烂、调得融、用手抓去不能吃的杂质；要凉热适宜；要边吃边添、当天的潲当天喂完，隔一天的要再煮；大小悬殊的猪不要同槽。
    喂食要做到定时、定量、定质。猪栏要向阳、要空气好，要干净、要白化猪栏（用石灰水刷）猪积肥要与猪睡处分开。养猪的同志说：猪吃的东西，一部分消耗了，一部分长成肉，不会养猪的，饱一顿饿一顿，罚猪住水牢，那末尽管喂了不少精饲料，都消耗光了不能长肉，甚至还要得病。
    会议收集了老的饲养经验和合作化以后新的饲养经验，也不只是摆经验，并研究出了一些道理把经验加以提高。会上有人主张用生饲料喂猪，可以节省柴火，并且举了一些科学上的道理，但因不合习惯，未被会议上的人采纳。
    饲料的潜力很大
    猪要吃得好，又要吃得饱；生猪生产的发展必须与饲料的发展相适应。宁乡土质好、气候好，不论青饲料精饲料的潜力都是很大。他们对于饲料作了深入的调查和布置。社员私留地不够的已作了调整，一头猪要有一分地。集体养猪留的地作了栽种计划，如潭佳山社十一个猪场，将每个猪场的地分作三个耕作区，一块种早白菜、伏菜、红薯等，一块种迟白菜、二道苦荞、萝卜菜等，一块种牛皮菜、洋苋菜等，这块吃完了那块又长起来，青饲料能相衔接。他们已派人去广东采水浮莲种，（湖北的同志谈：湖北去年种的水浮莲，收获很好。）对捞浮苹、水仙花、菱角等的水上植物和野草，也作了计划。对于精饲料，除留的饲料和公家供应的细糠外，要加种红薯、湾豆、芋头、洋芋等为补充。
    值得注意的是：宁乡今年猪的发展比去年增加120％，饲料需要随之增加，增加的方法，有的还是新的如种水浮莲。就是像潭佳山这样先进的养猪社，今年计划集体养猪比去年大三倍，共一千五百零六头，内有架子猪四百二十六头，母猪一百四十六头，而留的地只三十六亩，因此除自种外，还缺乏四十多万斤饲料，要在牛车坝、三星湖等处捞浪草菱角草等，以及待种的水浮莲。种猪草的地要做得像城郊区的菜土一样，长得快又长得多。要多种红薯、南瓜等，只要肥料多（肥料仍出在猪身上）像红薯这样作物一亩出红薯不是几千斤而应该是上万斤。红薯藤又是很好的青饲料。红薯粉是宁乡特产，比任何豆制的粉条好。出了粉的红薯渣，是好的精饲料，可以久藏不坏，人也可以吃。毛湾豆宁乡也有，据湖北同志说：毛湾豆不占地，墙边屋角都可栽，一兜可以摘十来斤，土肥的可以摘二三十斤。猪吃了毛湾豆喜睡，宜于喂肉猪。湖北农业厅今年买了五千多斤，送给农民做种。
    宁乡发展养猪的青饲料精饲料的办法是有的。只是在初次大发展时，种饲料的肥料还不足，特别是集体养猪由于摊子大，容易发生计划不周，饲料缺少。因此县的生猪生产办公室，要密切注意饲料的生产，防止脱节。找到了集体养猪的经验
    宁乡集体养猪的经验，是从失败中摸索出的。像潭佳山社流沙河社的集体养猪，都有失败、折本的一段，但是，他们没有被骇退。他们得出了改进的规律：1、领导养猪的人政治要强，对集体生产比个人生产还关心；2、劳动力要强。以为养猪是轻微劳动，老汉妇女可干得了，是错的；3、要有系列的饲养计划和劳动报酬计划。他们选了强的人去担任养猪，社的管委会经常去检查、指导，集体养猪就马上变好了。以潭佳山为例，除因地取材解决饲料、喂猪定时、定量、定质外，还制定了经营管理办法。开始推行“按产计酬制”、接着又制定劳动定额，把全部养猪工活摆出来分为六类，一类又分几项，按一个中等劳动力忠实劳动一天可能达到数量及应达到的标准，定出各项工活的工分报酬。有些工活时间与数量不稳定的，如晒猪栏草、找公猪配种等，按件计酬；有些工序与责任相连的用综合定额。他们自定的表很细，外行人不能马上看懂。但他们的积极性提高了，养猪赚钱了。以前不赞成集体养的社员现在都说集体养好，能解决个人不能解决的问题，能赚大钱。这次养猪会议的人去潭佳山参观，都说“看了潭佳山，任何事都心中有底了。”
    为防止冒进，宁乡今年只计划集体养二十五万头，不到总数的四分之一。
    养猪是为着长肉，猪病了不能长肉，死了更要赔本。因此，第一、要防止病，办法是注意猪的环境卫生。猪栏要有阳光，通空气，要用砖、石或木板铺地，经常洒石灰水、屎尿在栏外；食料要洗净、煮烂，没有杂东西。有一位老人说他家养母猪已六十年，经常有大小猪几十头，没有死过猪。原因即在于此。第二，要防止传染病。现在猪的流动大，入境的猪须经过检验；死猪肉不可吃，因吃死肉而传染猪病的，例子已是不少。必要时要打防疫针。第三，要传播有效的容易置办的治猪病的老方子。
    县府里喂养的大肥猪
    “猪大三百斤”，这次我看到的大猪，冲破了这个古话。这就是宁乡县人民委员会养的猪，养了一十三头，有三头大的，站起来像一堵墙。我问：有四百多斤肉一头吗？那位传达兼饲养员同志答：没有，不过三百多斤。春节前杀的一头，光肉有六百斤，水油板油有一百一十斤。看来，这三头猪架子还松，可能长得那样大。猪种仍是本地的。猪栏很清洁，木板上放稻草，屎尿在另一处。食槽洗得干净。饲养同志说：我们没有喂粮食，只喂得一点糠和县府厨房的潲水。青饲料是自种的。
    为什么有的猪这样大，市面供应的猪又这样小？我这次经过保定、郑州、武汉、长沙等处都看不到大猪肉。在宁乡，历来非大猪不杀卖，这回我看到的派购猪，都是活重一百五六十斤左右的。有人说：收购站不等猪长大就催送去，他们的任务是完成收购多少头猪而不是完成多少斤肉重。又有人说：农民饲料不够，不等长大就要卖掉。两说，道理都不充足。我想：一头大猪抵得几头半大子猪，肉厚、油多、好吃。我们发展猪要猪的数量，更要猪的质量。我希望宁乡县府生猪生产办公室，不要关起门做养大猪的模范，而要把养大猪的方法推广出去，使到处都有大猪。
    宁乡的养猪会议开过三个多月了。最近消息：农村里“肉有吃了、油也没问题了”。如达平均每人一年吃到十五斤肉，那就等于过去的富农生活了。4、5月间流沙河、坝塘、偕乐桥等虽然发生猪瘟，经过打猪瘟血清针，已被扑灭。估计生猪计划可以完成。那不仅为明年猪的发展奠定了基础，而且将为农业丰收提供良好条件。
