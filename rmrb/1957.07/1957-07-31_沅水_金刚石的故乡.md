    Yuan River – Hometown of Diamonds
    Ke Shanwen
    On both banks of the Yuan River, steep cliffs rise, and a line of green waves rolls. Standing on the peaks, people can see this majestic and beautiful scenery! Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li are the four famous rivers of Hunan. The Yuan River is over a thousand miles long, with raging waves and rapid currents, pouring into Dongting Lake. Unlike the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, which carry mud and sand, its bright, clear碧波 contains particles of gold and diamonds, scattered along the riverbanks.

    For thousands of years, the diamond sand washed down from the upper reaches of the Yuan River has been deeply buried in the underground of its riverbed. In 1957, the Yuan River Survey and Prospecting Team of the Ministry of Geology discovered diamond deposits of approximately 600,000 carats. The diamonds discovered so far are placer deposits, indicating that the primary ore deposits of diamonds growing in the upper reaches of the Yuan River have been eroded by floods over time and accumulated downstream with the flow of waves. Engineer Zhang of the Prospecting Team said that since we have discovered diamond placer deposits, "water has a source, and trees have roots," we will definitely be able to track down and find the primary ore deposits of diamonds. Recently, the Survey and Prospecting Team has sent two detachments to the upper reaches of the Yuan River and the border between Hunan and Guizhou for prospecting.

    One bright sunny morning in June, Comrade Cui of the Diamond Prospecting Team led me to visit various detachments to see how the "treasures" were dug up from the ground. On the simple highway leading to the field diamond washing area, brand-new Liberation trucks fully loaded with diamond sand sped by, and mountains of fine sand and stones dug up from the ground were piled up along the road. Looking at the large piles of sand dozens of meters high, and the workers with sweat-covered faces, they had to sift through hundreds of millions of sand grains to select a single diamond.

    We passed a small hill about 300 meters high, and looking north from here, we could see a faint line of shimmering silver light in the distance, which was the Yuan River.

    At the diamond washing site, rows of vertical shafts, twenty to thirty meters deep, were being dug. The workers hoisted the sand and stones from the ancient riverbed from the dark depths of the shafts to the surface, basket by basket. Once, when a full basket of sand and stones had just been lifted out of the well, a pure white light radiated from the basket of sand and stones! Ah! It turned out to be a rather large diamond! Such large diamonds are rare. A very small amount of extremely small diamond particles are contained in a large amount of sand and stones, often indistinguishable to the naked eye. Therefore, Comrade Cui also took me to see some of the mineral processing work. There are many mineral processing steps, and they are very complicated. I was particularly interested in two types of mineral processing methods: one is oil selection, which is to apply evenly mixed various types of engine oil on each level of the trapezoidal wooden board. The fine sand and stones are washed by water, rolling down the steps of the wooden frame. The fine-grained diamonds are heavier than the sand and stones, so they stick to the layers of wooden boards coated with engine oil. The other type of mineral processing method is like using X-rays for fluoroscopy in a hospital. The sand and stones are placed in a dark room and illuminated with fluorescent light. If the sand and stones contain diamonds, a faint blue and silvery white light can be seen shining in the sand and stones. That shining light is the diamond.

    沅水——金刚石的故乡
    柯善文
    沅水两岸峭岩耸立，一线青浪滚滚。人们站立在峰巅高处远眺，就能看到这雄伟秀丽的景色！湘、资、沅、澧，是湖南四大名水。沅水长千余里，狂浪急流，倾注于洞庭湖。它不像黄河、长江挟泥带沙；却在它那亮晶的、清彻的碧波里，含着黄金和金刚石的颗粒，散布到江的沿岸。
    千百年来沅水上游冲刷下来的金刚石砂，深深地埋藏在它的河床的地下。1957年，地质部沅水勘测普查队，已查获埋藏量约六十万克拉的金刚石。现在所发现的金刚石是砂矿床，说明生长在沅水上游的金刚石底原生矿床，它的金刚石日久受洪水的剥离，随浪流散到下游蓄积起来的。普查队的章工程师说，我们既然发现了金刚石底砂矿床，“水有源，树有根”，我们就一定能够跟踪追迹找到金刚石底原生矿床的。最近，勘测普查队已派了两个分队前往沅水上游和湘黔边境普查。
    6月里一个艳阳辉映的上午，金刚石普查队的崔同志领我去参观各个分队，看“宝贝”怎样从地下挖起来。在通往野外淘钻工区的简易公路上，崭新的解放牌汽车满满载着金刚石砂飞驶而过，路旁堆放着山一般的从地底淘掘上来的细砂石。我望着那十数公尺高的大砂堆，望着那汗珠满面的工人们，他们要在亿万颗砂粒中，才能淘选出一颗金刚石。
    我们行经一座约三百公尺高的小山头，从这里向北望去，远远地有一线隐隐约约的闪闪银光，那就是沅水。
    淘钻工地上，一排排开掘着二、三十公尺深的竖井。工人们就从那深黑的井底下一箩箩地把古河床的砂石吊运到地面上来。有一次，当一满箩砂石刚刚吊出井口时，只见那箩砂石之中，放射出一道洁白的亮光，啊！原来是一颗蛮大的金刚石哩！这样大的金刚石是少见的。在大量的砂石里，含着极少量极小粒的金刚石，往往是眼睛分辨不出来的。因此，崔同志又带着我去看选矿工作的部分。选矿工序很多，很复杂。我只对两种选矿办法特别感到兴趣：一是油选，那是用调配得均称的各类机油，涂抹在梯形的每级木板上，细砂石被水冲刷着，顺着木架的梯级滚滚而下，细颗粒的金刚石比砂石重，它就粘在涂有机油的各层木板上了。另外一种选矿法，就像我们在医院里用爱克斯光透视一样，把砂石放进漆黑的房间里，用萤光灯的光照射它，如果砂石里含有金刚石的话，就可以看见砂石里闪耀着一种淡蓝色的和银白色的闪光。那闪光的就是金刚石。
