    Warsaw Dispatch: The Central Secretariat of the Polish United Workers' Party recently issued instructions regarding theoretical study for the entire party. The instructions emphasized that study must be linked to the actual conditions of Poland. The instructions stressed the necessity of studying the documents of the Ninth Plenary Session, as this is one of the conditions for achieving party unity. The instructions pointed out: it is necessary to organize and improve the issue of long-term political study, and to oppose the view existing within the party that party study is unnecessary. In study, it is necessary to avoid rote learning, dogmatism, and simplistic methods of studying phenomena and processes. Attention should be paid to people's interests and the special needs of various departments during study, and the principle of voluntarism should be observed. Special attention should be paid to issues that people do not understand clearly.

    The basic purpose of the study should be to enable party members to understand: the essential characteristics and prospects of Poland's path to socialism, as well as the party's agricultural program and the party's leading role, etc. The study plan should include topics such as internationalism, consolidating the materialist worldview, and modern capitalism.

    The instructions concluded by pointing out that the basic form of party study is small groups studying current domestic and international policies. In addition, there can be economics groups, night schools for activists, and self-study groups.

    波兰党号召全党学习理论
    强调理论联系实际反对教条主义方法
    本报华沙5日电　波兰统一工人党中央书记处最近发出了关于全党进行理论学习的指示，指示强调学习必须联系波兰的实际。指示强调了学习九中全会文件的必要性，因为这是取得党的团结的条件之一。指示指出：应该组织和改进长期政治学习的问题、反对在党内存在这种看法：似乎党的学习是不必要的。学习中要避免死读书、教条主义和把现象和过程简单化的学习方法。学习时应注意到人们的兴趣和各部门的特别需要，并遵守自愿的原则，应特别注意人们了解不清的问题。
    学习的基本目的应使党员了解：波兰走向社会主义道路的实质特点及其前途，以及党的农业纲领和党的领导作用等。学习计划应包括国际主义、巩固唯物主义世界观、现代资本主义等题目。
    指示最后指出党的学习的基本形式是，学习当前国内外政策的小组。此外还可以有经济学小组，积极分子夜校和自修小组等形式。
