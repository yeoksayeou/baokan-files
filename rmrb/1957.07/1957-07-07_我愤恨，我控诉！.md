Beijing's China Democratic League organization, because it did not accept the instructions of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, has been like a little daughter-in-law in a feudal family for many years, never able to please these two wicked mother-in-laws who wanted to remarry.
Wu Han's Speech

I am a member of the China Democratic League, and since 1946 I have been responsible for the work of the Beijing Democratic League's local organization. I represent myself and the vast majority of members of the Beijing Democratic League in accusing Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji of their criminal anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities are consistent, organized, planned, deployed, strategic, and have an ultimate goal. Moreover, they are coordinated with anti-communist elements in various aspects, acting in different ways but achieving the same goals, echoing each other,妄想drilling through the cracks of the Party's rectification movement, seizing the Party's leadership, and turning today's people's world into a world of the Zhang-Luo alliance, transforming the socialist country led by the working class into a capitalist country ruled by the bourgeoisie where the working people are oppressed and exploited, actually a US-style country. Their words and actions violate the charter of the China Democratic League, violate the Constitution, oppose the people of the whole country, and also oppose the majority of members of the China Democratic League. I resent, I accuse.

The charter of the China Democratic League stipulates acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, and the preamble to the Constitution affirms the leadership of the Communist Party. The Beijing League's organization has always adhered to the basic principle that the League's organizations at all levels must accept the leadership of the Party at the same level. Zhang and Luo paid lip service to this principle, but in practice, they did the opposite. They unanimously, and for many years, maliciously attacked the Beijing League's organization. Although we have consistently implemented the instructions of the League Central Committee, we were accused of "only listening to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party" and not listening to them because we did not accept their conspiratorial anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-people instructions. They said that the Municipal Committee of the Democratic League was against leadership, undisciplined, and an independent kingdom. They said that our acceptance of the Party's leadership was "cutting the China Democratic League in half." We only accept the leadership of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League that conforms to the charter of the League and the interests of the people, but we will never accept the personal leadership of Zhang and Luo, who are anti-people and anti-socialist, and resolutely accept the leadership of the Party in accordance with the charter of the League and the Constitution. They were not reconciled and tried to drive a wedge in. In 1951, Luo Longji campaigned for Chen Xingui, a well-known right-wing general, to be elected to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, inviting Tsinghua League members and professors to dinner, asking them to vote for Chen Xingui. The dinner was eaten, but the vote was not cast, and it fell through. They also tried to pull people out of the Municipal Democratic League, inviting our three full-time cadres to dinner, saying that as long as the Beijing League cooperated with the Central Committee (Luo), the affairs of the Democratic League would be easy to handle. The dinner was eaten, and the three cadres came back and told the organization, and the clever plan fell through again. Zhang Bojun said to me at Tiananmen Square on May Day in 1951, "As long as the two of us cooperate, things will be easy to handle." I ignored it. In this way, they became more and more resentful and hostile to us, and whatever we did was always wrong. Because the Beijing League did not accept the leadership of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, who were anti-socialist and anti-people, it has been like a little daughter-in-law in a feudal family for many years, never able to please these two wicked mother-in-laws who wanted to remarry.

Zhang and Luo, two bosses of many years, became allies
Zhang and Luo were originally two bosses, vying for power and profit, scheming against each other, and not interfering with each other. In the past, there were irreconcilable contradictions between them, vying for positions in the League and arranging their respective cronies. Since the founding of the country, Zhang and Luo in the Central Committee of the Democratic League have never thought of doing anything good for the people except for personnel disputes. Suddenly, more than a year ago, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, after the Hungarian incident, after the anti-communist upsurge in various countries, and after the slogan of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, their assessment of the international and domestic situation was that the situation was about to change, the Communist Party would not last long, and the democratic parties had a lot to offer. Zhang and Luo, two bosses of many years, suddenly became the Zhang-Luo alliance, the two sang in harmony, spoke with one voice, and spoke in the same tone. It was not individual but united to attack us. This is specifically manifested in the fight for the academic journal "Zhengming" monthly magazine that we founded. This journal had been in preparation for more than half a year, and when it was about to be published, these two pulled a face and said to me, "You can't run it, you can only hand it over to the Central Committee of the Democratic League," that is, hand it over to them. Zhang said, "Academic is unreasonable, we should run a political one." Later, Luo also said this at the editorial board meeting. Now we are clear, what is the so-called political nature? It is to turn Zhengming into a bourgeois anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist mouthpiece of the Zhang-Luo alliance like the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, to peddle their private goods through this journal, to slander the Party and attack the Party through this journal; and to guide the entire League to take the Anglo-American capitalist road through this journal. The reason why this conspiracy was not realized was only because they could not find their own editors for a while. They seized it, but they could not change the nature of this journal.

After the rectification movement began, Zhang Bojun said that he wanted to establish a political design institute, and Luo Longji said that he wanted to establish a rehabilitation committee. The names were different, but the essence was the same. Both attempted to create another set outside our highest state power organ—the National People's Congress. The purpose was nothing more than to make our state power leave the leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party, and drag our country from the socialist road to the capitalist road. The anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist face was completely exposed at once. This hideous and ugly face shocked us. We originally thought that Zhang and Luo were just personally ambitious and morally depraved, but it turned out that they were a group of anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist people with ulterior motives who wanted to take the capitalist road and the American-style road in China. In this way, we recognized their previous faces and exposed our past lack of the political acumen that the people should have towards right-wing elements such as Zhang and Luo.

A line connects opposition to socialism
We figured out that the year before last, after a meeting, Zhang Bojun invited Luo Longji's people to dinner, arranging for Shen Zhiyuan in Shanghai that the Democratic League should develop to one or two million people, and a Senate should be established.

We also remembered that at the second congress of the Beijing League last summer, Zhang Bojun gave a speech, calling for great development and the development of youth. He said, "If we don't do this, how can we talk about long-term coexistence?" Today, comparing his words with what Luo said at the United Front Work Department symposium, weren't they printed from the same plate?

We also remembered what Luo said last year, "Today's contradiction is the contradiction between the petty-bourgeoisie, the great intellectuals, and the proletariat, the petty intellectuals." Now we understand the meaning of this sentence, that is, the Communist Party cannot lead the intellectuals, and should be led by great intellectuals such as Zhang and Luo. Comparing it with his speech, intellectuals should not join the Communist Party, but should join the Democratic League. Isn't it a consistent effort? Comparing it with his speech at the CPPCC, intellectuals should be visited three times, treated as national scholars, and treated with courtesy, and there should be no ideological transformation. Isn't it a line of development? Comparing it with the words and deeds of certain right-wing elements in the Democratic League in various universities, they said that most Communist Party members are country bumpkins, uncultured, and do not understand business. Laymen lead experts, making the school a mess, so they set fires everywhere to drive the Party organization out of the school. Isn't this Luo Longji's ideological system? Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, who oppose the people and oppose socialism, appear everywhere with the false mask of "speaking for intellectuals" and "protecting scientists," but they never talk about whether they are intellectuals who serve capitalism or intellectuals who serve socialism, whether they are bourgeois intellectuals or proletarian intellectuals, whether they are comprador and traitor intellectuals who are running dogs for imperialism or patriotic intellectuals who oppose all imperialism (including the so-called "free world" of Britain and the United States). When they talk about the Party, they never talk about whether it is a party that represents the interests of the people or a party that opposes the people. "Great intellectuals" like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji would never lack such common sense. Because when one analyzes intellectuals and parties in this way, it will reveal their original anti-people and anti-socialist form, and actually expose the ugly face of being a running dog and mouthpiece for the "free world" of Britain and the United States. Therefore, they are taciturn and cautious, hiding from the mirror that reveals the class essence.

Used false communication to light a fire to drive the Party committee out of the school
Starting from such a common foundation of Zhang and Luo being anti-Party and anti-socialist, at the propaganda work conference opened in April, they vigorously deployed anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, demanding that the Party committee withdraw from the school. The basis was to falsely convey a speech by Chairman Mao. The chairman said that the Party committee system in schools could be studied. When Zhang and Luo conveyed it, it became "Chairman Mao said, I suggest that the Party committee system in schools should be abolished first, and the Communist Party should not monopolize it." And this false communication was printed in the "Democratic League Central Committee Work Bulletin" No. 15 and sent to League organizations all over the country; some organizations also reprinted it and distributed it to various grassroots organizations. In this way, this fire was lit in all universities where Democratic League right-wing elements were active. They used this magic weapon to organize and mobilize anti-Party forces, attack the Party, slander the Party, and drive the Party organization out of the gate, "sweep it out the door." Not to mention other places, in Beijing alone, there were the "democratic school-running" plans of Tao Dayong and others at Beijing Normal University, where everything was managed by experts, that is, great intellectuals, professors had the right to make decisions, and the Party committee could only manage general affairs and ideological education. Pang Xunqin and his gang at the Academy of Arts and Design were even more prominent. The academy system organization chart they listed completely abolished the Party committee and designated the Communist Party's president and vice president to be driven away. If they didn't leave, they would use the method of "bombing" and designated the Party leader he supported.

Not only should the Party committee withdraw from the school, but it must also withdraw from the agency. It is said that the Party in schools and agencies forms a wall, which is the reason for more contradictions.

What is serious is that this kind of argument is not only in the Democratic League, but also in other parties. It is a chorus of octaves. For example, Huang Shaohong said that the Party should not directly issue orders to the people, and Tan Tiwu said that there should not be another set of Party systems outside the government, and also advocated abolishing the Communist Party's various departments and absorbing non-Party people to participate in the Party group's work; judicial, procuratorial, and other agencies should not be led by the Party committee, and so on. Chen Mingshu and Zhang Bojun wanted to abolish the school Party committee system and let the Democratic Party, which accounted for the majority, lead the school. The right-wing elements in the business community advocated that the Party in the joint state-private factories should withdraw, and even the Party in the state-owned factories should withdraw. From their confessions, isn't it "Sima Zhao's heart is known to everyone," and isn't their ugly original form of anti-socialism revealed clearly enough?

Zhang and Luo's "capital" for jointly running a black shop
Zhang Bojun's political design institute and his talks within the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, "I take the lead and advocate that China should have a bicameral system, turning the CPPCC into a Senate and the NPC into a House of Representatives. The CPPCC has the right to supervise and disagree (veto), and the NPC has the right to elect and legislate." The so-called right to supervise and disagree is essentially to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. He also said that many people have agreed with this proposal. We want to ask, who are the many people he mentioned, except for the bourgeois right-wing elements and a very small number of people who have been deceived by them? He also said, "A big party has big capital, and a small party has small capital. To be a politician, one must proceed from reality." This also explains why he advocated great development, and the scale of development is getting bigger and bigger, from one or two million to eight million. It also explains why he wants to drag the new China onto the capitalist road with his so-called big capital. But he forgot that Chiang Kai-shek also once had the largest party in China, but in the end, it did not save his shameful fate of failure. He forgot that all anti-people parties, no matter how big or small, are destined to be abandoned by the people, thrown into the garbage pit, and buried by the people.

He has capital, two parties, one the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, where he is the absolute leader, and one the Democratic League, where he is the first vice chairman. After allying with Luo Longji, he monopolized everything. There is also a newspaper, the Guangming Daily. But the capital is not big enough, and he can't drag 600 million people along. That's why he wants to develop eight million people.

Luo Longji's capital is even smaller than Zhang Bojun's. There is only a small group, which includes Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Zhihe, Ye Duyi, Pan Dakui, Liu Wang Liming, Zhou Jingwen, and others. Generally, a small group of American students who graduated from Tsinghua University and are unwilling to take the socialist road are the backbone. They are all "petty-bourgeoisie, great intellectuals." Although the number is small, Zhang Bojun does not think the weight is light. Among them, Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong also claim to be the most familiar with and understand intellectuals, and are spokespersons for the bourgeois intellectual right-wing. Because he does not have his own party, he has to engage in strongholds and seize the leadership of local organizations through his people. His strongholds are Pan Dakui in the Southwest, Wang Wenguang in Taiyuan, Jiang Zhenzhong in Zhejiang, Peng Wenyin and Chen Renbing in Shanghai, Du Maizhi in Hunan, and Ma Zhemin in Hubei. With this little capital, he can also form an alliance with Zhang Bojun, plan in secret rooms, light fires at the grassroots level, and echo each other in all directions.

Want to borrow "rehabilitation" to light another fire
Luo Longji cooperated with Zhang Bojun to light the fire of the Party committee system and also lit another fire, the fire of "rehabilitation." His goal is to win over intellectuals, and the method is to speak and write articles for those bourgeois intellectuals who feel that it is still "early spring weather, sometimes warm and sometimes cold." He wants to get something out of it. After his talk about the rehabilitation committee was published, he received more than 100 letters; his reply was "Please create public opinion in all aspects and suggest it to the United Front Work Department and the National Committee of the CPPCC." What kind of public opinion should be created? Obviously, it is public opinion against the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, public opinion against the people, and public opinion against the government. He estimated that if this kind of public opinion was created, "the world would be in chaos," wouldn't he be able to replace it and eventually achieve "great success"?

Another strategy for creating public opinion is to seize a newspaper. Through his female general Pu Xixiu, he seized the Wenhui Daily, forming a public opinion manufacturing department of Luo Longji-Pu Xixiu-Wenhui Daily Editorial Department. At the same time, he also created the public opinion of "Party world" through and at the instigation of Chu Anping. In this way, two parties went deep into the grassroots to light fires, and two newspapers, one in the north and one in the south, sent a large number of reporters to nine major cities and various universities to light fires everywhere. The flames were diffused, and the smoke and dust covered the eyes, making themselves dizzy. They thought that the Communist Party had "lost the hearts of the people," thinking that "the Communist Party can release but cannot收, it will take three million troops to收, but the hearts of the people are gone. This ship is going to sink." Where is the way out? As long as the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji of the Democratic Party come out and speak, "Now the Democratic Party's speech has power." Zhang Bojun's conclusion was "The Communist Party is now in a dilemma, it is not good to 收, and it is not good to release. Now our Democratic League has the responsibility to help the Party." He had the feeling of "cleaning up the mess, who else but me." This is the conclusion reached by the Scientific Planning Committee, one of the four committees organized by Zhang and Luo, at an emergency meeting convened by Zhang Bojun in Beijing on June 6 with six professors: Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Qian Weichang, Tao Dayong, Wu Jingchao, and Huang Yaomian. These six professors are mainly the secret room figures of the Luo group. This meeting was an action performance of the Zhang-Luo alliance and a climax after the Zhang-Luo alliance set fires everywhere, a climax of anti-communism and anti-socialism. They vainly attempted to create such an atmosphere to threaten the Party and carry out political blackmail. They wanted to take this opportunity to stand up and usurp power in the name of helping. Their remarks coordinated with the right-wing elements in various aspects, acting in different ways but achieving the same goals, echoing each other. They fantasized that the Hungarian incident would be repeated in the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tempered in a hundred battles. The result was that, starting from the smoke screen created by their own fire, they made a wrong estimate and committed sinful actions. They lit the fire, and the fire burned them. They holed the boat, and the entire right-wing elements went into the water, exposing that they are the enemies of the people.

They stole the name of the Democratic League
Representatives, I should point out that the vast majority of members of the Democratic League have never heard of the series of sinful activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance, let alone supported the sinful activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance. The four committees planned by Zhang and Luo were not approved by the Central Committee of the Democratic League, and even Chairman Shen Junru did not know about them. The Party committee system and the Scientific Planning Committee among these four committees carried out various despicable and shameless activities in Beijing without the approval of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League. They stole the name of the Democratic League, carried out illegal activities in the name of legal organizations, and carried out sinful activities of sabotaging the Party and overthrowing the Party in the name of helping the Party's rectification. This is absolutely not allowed by the members of the Democratic League and the people of the whole country. I am making an accusation against Zhang and Luo's sinful activities at this solemn meeting. I hope that they will honestly confess their various conspiratorial activities, thoroughly reform themselves, and not isolate themselves from the people and cut themselves off from the people. Only in this way can they have a way out. I am reporting to the representatives at this solemn meeting that our entire League has launched a rectification campaign and fully launched the struggle against the right-wing. We will never stop until we win a complete victory. I dare say that the China Democratic League, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has been, is, and will continue to be the most loyal ally of the Communist Party. We will always follow the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road. (Attached picture)

    我愤恨，我控诉！
    北京的民盟组织因为没有接受章伯钧、罗隆基的指使，多年来像是封建家庭的小媳妇，怎样也趁不了这两个要改嫁的恶婆婆的心。
    吴晗的发言
    我是中国民主同盟盟员，从一九四六年起就负责北京民盟地方组织的工作。我代表我自己和北京市绝大多数盟员，控诉章伯钧、罗隆基反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    章伯钧、罗隆基的反党反社会主义的活动是一贯的，有组织、有计划、有部署、有策略、有最终目的，并且，还和各方面的反共分子有配合，异曲同工，互相呼应，妄想钻帮助党整风的空子，夺取党的领导权，把今日人民的天下，变为章罗同盟的天下，把工人阶级领导的社会主义的国家，变成资产阶级专政的劳动人民受压迫、受剥削的资本主义的国家，实际是美国式的国家。他们的言论行动是破坏民盟盟章的，是违反宪法的，是反对全国人民的，也是反对民盟的多数盟员的。我愤恨，我控诉。
    民盟的盟章规定接受共产党的领导，宪法序言肯定了共产党的领导。北京盟的组织一向坚持盟的各级组织必须接受同级党的领导的基本原则。这个原则章罗在表面上敷衍，在实际行动上恰好相反。他们异口同声，多年来恶意攻击北京盟组织，虽然我们一贯执行盟中央的指示，但是却因为不接受他们阴谋反共、反社会主义、反人民的指示，就说我们“只听中共北京市委的话”，不听他们的话，说民盟市委反领导，无组织，无纪律，是独立王国。说我们接受党的领导，是“腰斩民盟”。我们只接受民盟中央符合盟章、符合人民利益的领导，却决不能接受章罗反人民反社会主义的个人领导，坚决地根据盟章和宪法，接受党的领导。他们不甘心，想法打一个楔子进来，一九五一年罗隆基替现在人所共知的右派健将陈新桂竞选民盟北京市委，请清华盟员教授吃饭，要他们投陈新桂的票，饭吃了，票没有投，落了空。又想法从市民盟拉人出去，请我们的三个脱产干部吃饭，说只要北京的盟和中央（罗）合作，民盟的事情就好办了，饭吃了，三个干部回来告诉了组织，妙计又落了空。章伯钧在一九五一年五一节，在天安门城楼上和我说，“只要我们两人合作，事情就好办”。我置之不理。这样，就越发仇视、敌视我们，无论我们作什么事，总是不对。北京的盟因为没有接受反社会主义反人民的章伯钧、罗隆基的领导，多年来像是封建家庭的小媳妇，怎样也趁不了这两个要改嫁的恶婆婆的心。
    章罗两个把头多年冤家变成联盟
    章罗两人原来是两个把头，争权夺利，勾心斗角，互不相干。过去，他们之间有不可调和的矛盾，在盟内争地位，争各自党羽的安排，建国以来，章罗在民盟中央，除了闹人事纠纷以外，从来也没有想到要替人民办点好事。突然一年多以前，在苏共二十次代表大会之后，在匈牙利事件之后，在世界各国反共高潮之后，在长期共存、互相监督的口号提出之后，他们对国际和国内形势的估计，以为要变天了，共产党站不长了，民主党派大有可为了。章罗两个多年冤家突然变成章罗同盟了，两个人此唱彼和一鼻孔出气了，一个腔调说话了。不是个别的而是联合一致的来打击我们了。具体表现在争夺我们创办的学术性刊物“争鸣”月刊上。这个刊物已经筹备了半年多，临到要出版了，这两人拉起面孔对我说，“你们不能办，只能交给民盟中央办”，就是交给他们办。章说，“学术性没有道理，要办个政治性的”。后来罗在编辑部会议上也这样说。现在我们清楚了，所谓政治性是什么呢，就是要把争鸣也变成像光明日报、文汇报那样的资产阶级的反共反人民反社会主义的章罗同盟的喉舌，通过这个刊物来贩卖他们的私货，通过这个刊物来诽谤党，攻击党；通过这个刊物来指导全盟走英美式的资本主义的道路。这个阴谋之所以没有实现，仅仅是因为他们一时还找不到他们自己的编辑，他们抓住了，却做不到使这个刊物变质。
    到了整风运动开始以后，章伯钧说要搞政治设计院，罗隆基说要搞平反委员会，名目不同，本质一样，都是企图在我们最高国家权力机关——全国人民代表大会以外，搞出另一套，目的不外是想使我们的国家政权离开工人阶级和它的先锋队——共产党的领导。把我们的国家从社会主义的道路拖到资本主义的道路上去。反党反人民反社会主义的面貌一下子完全暴露了，这个狰狞丑恶的面貌，使我们大吃一惊，原来以为只是有个人野心、品德卑劣的章罗，却原来是心怀叵测，想在中国走资本主义道路走美国式的道路的反共反人民反社会主义集团。这样，才连他们以前的那付嘴脸也辨认出来了，也暴露了我们过去对章罗等右派分子缺乏人民应有的政治嗅觉。
    一条线串起来反对社会主义
    我们弄清楚了，前年在一次会议之后，章伯钧请罗隆基的人吃饭，布置上海的沈志远，民盟要发展到一、二百万人，要搞个上议院。
    我们也想起了，去年夏天，北京盟的第二次代表大会上，章伯钧讲话，要大发展，要发展青年。说是“不如此，如何能谈到长期共存”。今天拿他的话和罗在统战部座谈会上说的一比，不是一个版子印出来的吗？
    我们也想起了，罗在去年说的话，“今天的矛盾是小资产阶级的大知识分子和无产阶级的小知识分子的矛盾”。现在明白这话的意思了，就是共产党不能领导知识分子，而应该由大知识分子如章罗者来领导。和他的发言一对比，知识分子不要参加共产党，应该参加民盟，不是一气呵成吗？再和他在政协的发言对照，对知识分子要三顾茅庐，要以国士待之，要礼贤下士，而不应该搞什么思想改造，不是一条线发展下来的吗？再和各个高等学校民盟某些右派分子的言行对比，他们说共产党员多是土包子，没有文化，不懂业务，以外行领导内行，搞得学校一团糟，因而到处放火，要把党组织赶出学校，这不就是罗隆基思想体系吗？反对人民反对社会主义的章伯钧、罗隆基到处以“代表知识分子说话”，“保护科学家”的假面具出现，但是他们从不讲是为资本主义服务的知识分子还是为社会主义服务的知识分子，是资产阶级的知识分子还是无产阶级的知识分子，是为帝国主义当走狗的买办的汉奸知识分子还是反对一切帝国主义（包括所谓“自由世界”的英美）的爱国知识分子，他们讲党的时候，从不讲这是代表人民利益的党还是反人民的党，以章伯钧、罗隆基这样的“大知识分子”决不会这样一点常识也没有，因为一这样去分析知识分子、分析党派的时候，就会揭露他们反人民反社会主义的原形，实际上为“自由世界”的英美作走卒、作喇叭的丑恶面目。因此，他们就讳莫如深小心翼翼地，躲着据以揭露阶级本质的照妖镜。
      用假传达点起一把火要把党委赶出学校
    从章罗这样一个反党反社会主义的共同基础出发，他们在4月开的宣传工作会议上，大张旗鼓地布置了反党反社会主义的活动，要党委退出学校。根据是假借传达毛主席的一次讲话，主席说学校党委制党可以研究。章罗传达时变成“毛主席说，我建议，首先撤销学校的党委制，不要由共产党包办。”并且把这个假传达印在“民盟中央工作简报”十五号上，发到全国各地盟组织；有些组织还翻印了发给各基层组织。这样，这把火就点到所有有民盟右派分子活动的高等学校里去了。他们拿这个法宝去组织动员反党力量，攻击党，诽谤党，要把党组织赶出大门，“扫地出门”。别的地方不说，光在北京，就有师范大学陶大镛等人的“民主办校”方案，什么事都归内行管，也就是大知识分子管，教授有决定权，党委只能管总务和思想教育工作。工艺美术学院的庞熏琴一帮更突出，他们所列出的学院系统组织表，根本取消了党委，指名要赶走共产党员的院长和副院长，如果不走，就要采用“轰”的办法，还指定了他所支持的党的负责人。
    不但党委要退出学校，还得退出机关，据说党在学校、机关是形成一堵墙，多一个矛盾的原因。
    严重的是，这种论调不只是民盟有，其他党派也有，是一个八音齐奏的合唱队。例如黄绍竑说党不应该直接向人民发号施令，谭惕吾说不应该在政权之外，再搞一套党的系统，还主张取消共产党的各个部，吸收党外人士参加党组工作；司法、检察等机关不应该受党委领导等等。陈铭枢、章伯钧要取消学校党委制，由占多数的民主党派来领导学校，工商界的右派分子则主张公私合营工厂的党应该退出，甚至国营工厂的党也要退出。从他们这些自招自供来看，难道还不是“司马昭之心路人皆知”，难道他们的反社会主义的丑恶原形显露得还不明白吗？
    章罗合伙经营黑店的“本钱”
    章伯钧的政治设计院和他在农工民主党内部的谈话，“我带头，主张中国搞两院制，把政协变成参议院，把人大变成众议院，政协有监督权和不同意权（否决权），人大有选举权和立法权。”所谓监督权和不同意权，实质上就是反对共产党的领导。他还说这个主张，已经有很多人同意。我们要问，他所谓很多人，除了资产阶级右派分子和受他们蒙蔽的极少数人之外，还有什么人呢？他还说“本钱大就是大党，本钱小就是小党，做一个政治家，就要从实际出发”，这也就说明了他为什么主张大发展，而且发展的规模越来越大，从一、二百万提高到八百万的缘故，也说明了他要拿这个他所谓大本钱把新中国拖上资本主义的道路，但是他忘记了当年蒋介石也曾经有一个中国最大的党，可是最后也没有拯救他可耻的失败的命运，他忘记了一切反人民的政党不管它大小，最后注定是要被人民抛弃，扔在垃圾坑和被人民埋葬的。
    他有本钱，有两个党，一个农工民主党，他是绝对党魁，一个民盟，他是第一副主席，和罗隆基同盟以后，包办一切。还有一个报纸，光明日报。但是本钱不够大，要拖六万万人上路，还拖不动，这就是他要发展八百万人的道理。
    罗隆基的本钱比章伯钧更小。只有一个小集团，这个小集团包括张东荪、曾昭抡、潘光旦、费孝通、吴景超、范朴斋、张志和、叶笃义、潘大逵、刘王立明、周鲸文等人。大体上以清华毕业一小撮不愿走社会主义道路的留美学生为骨干，都是“小资产阶级的大知识分子”，人数虽少，分量在章伯钧看来却不轻。其中罗隆基、费孝通又自命为最熟悉和了解知识分子的，是资产阶级知识分子右派的代言人。因为他没有一个自己的党，所以只好搞据点，通过他的人来夺取当地组织的领导权。他的据点在西南是潘大逵，在太原是王文光，在浙江是姜震中，在上海是彭文应、陈仁炳，在湖南是杜迈之，在湖北是马哲民。他有这点本钱，也就可以和章伯钧结成同盟，也就可以策划于密室，点火于基层，上下串连，八方呼应。
    想借“平反”点起另一把火
    罗隆基和章伯钧配合点党委制的火，还点另一把火，“平反”的火。他的目标是争取知识分子，办法是替那些到今天才感觉是“早春天气乍暖还寒”的资产阶级知识分子说话和写文章。想从中捞一把。在他的平反委员会谈话发表之后，收到一百多封信；他的回信是“请在各方面造成舆论，请向统战部和政协全国委员会建议”。造成什么舆论呢？很显然，是反对肃反的舆论，反人民、反政府的舆论。这种舆论造成了，他估计“天下大乱”了，不是就可以取而代之，终成“大业”了吗？
      被自己放的火烧昏了
    造成舆论另一策略是夺取一个报纸，通过他的女将浦熙修攫取了文汇报，构成了罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部这样一个制造舆论部。同时，他还通过和授意储安平，造成了“党天下”的舆论。这样，两个党派，深入到基层点火，两个报纸，一北一南，派出大批记者，到九大城市、到各个大学到处点火。火焰弥漫，烟尘蔽目，弄得他们自己也晕头转向了，以为共产党“失去人心”，以为“共产党能放不能收，要收得三百万军队，但人心是去了。这条船要沉了。”出路在哪里呢？只要民主党派的章伯钧、罗隆基等人出来说话就可以，“现在民主党派说话是有力量的”。章伯钧的结论是“共产党现在弄得进退失措，收不好，放也不好，现在我们民盟有责任帮助党。”大有“收拾残局，舍我其谁”之慨。这就是章罗所组织的四个委员会之一的科学规划委员会，六月六日由章伯钧召集北京曾昭抡、费孝通、钱伟长、陶大镛、吴景超、黄药眠等六教授举行紧急会议所得的结论，这六个教授主要是罗集团的密室人物，这次会议，是章罗同盟的一次行动表现，也是章罗同盟到处点火以后的高潮，反共反社会主义的高潮。他们妄图制造这样的气氛来威胁党，进行政治讹诈，他们要借此挺身而出，以帮助之名，行篡夺之实。他们的言论和各方面的右派分子配合，异曲同工，互相呼应。他们幻想匈牙利事件会重演于百炼成钢的中国共产党领导下的新中国，结果是从自己点火所造成的烟幕出发，错误的估计，罪恶的行动，点火，火烧了他们自己，凿船，整个右派分子下了水，暴露出他们是人民的敌人。
      他们盗窃了民盟的名义
    代表们，我应该指出，绝大部分的民盟成员从来没有与闻过章罗同盟的一系列罪恶活动，更从来没有支持过章罗同盟的罪恶活动。章罗所策划的四个委员会，是没有经过民盟中央同意的，连沈钧儒主席都不知道。这四个委员会之中的党委制和科学规划委员会在北京进行各种卑鄙无耻的活动，是没有经过民盟北京市委的。他们盗窃了民盟的名义，以合法的组织进行非法的活动，以帮助党整风的名义进行破坏党推翻党的罪恶的活动，这是民盟盟员和全国人民所绝对不能容许的。我在这个庄严的会场上提出对章罗的罪恶活动的控诉，我希望他们老老实实地交代自己的各种阴谋活动，革心洗面地痛改前非，不要自外于人民、自绝于人民，只有这样他们才有出路。我在这个庄严的会场上向代表们报告，我们全盟已经进行整风，全力展开反右派的斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵。我敢说中国民主同盟在共产党领导下，过去是、现在是、将来还是共产党最忠实的同盟者，我们永远跟着共产党走，坚决走社会主义的道路。（附图片）
