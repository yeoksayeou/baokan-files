    Where Can Gu Zhizhong Hide?
    Yu Zishui
    Gu Zhizhong incited members of the Jiusan Society to use methods of violent storms to rectify the Communist Party, to "enlarge the caliber of cannons," and to "launch long-range and short-range missiles" to throw the world into chaos. (See the People's Daily, July 5th) What do missiles actually look like? Gu Zhizhong and his ilk probably haven't even seen a shadow of one, yet he buzzes and clamors: "Launch long-range and short-range ones." Wall Street war-mongers have recruited a believer, which they can perhaps console themselves with; and Gu Zhizhong's hatred for the Communist Party is also vividly displayed on paper. People can truly imagine the grimacing face of this hypocrite, who started his career with boasting and deception, and hear the sound of his gnashing teeth.
    Extreme arrogance is also extreme stupidity. Real missiles cannot save the war-mongers of Wall Street, so how can imaginary missiles bring any benefit to the rightists?
    Lu Yi began to confess in Shanghai the conspiracy activities of Gu Zhizhong and Wang Zaoshi. This missile hero said: "I was betrayed by Lu Yi." Although it was actually Gu Zhizhong himself who betrayed Gu Zhizhong, Lu Yi's confession can also be regarded as a missile, neither far nor near. Let's see where Gu Zhizhong still wants to hide?

    顾执中往哪里躲
    庾子水
    顾执中煽动九三学社的社员要用狂风暴雨的方法整共产党，要“放大口径炮”，要“放远距离和近距离的导弹”，把天下搞乱。（见7月5日人民日报）导弹究竟是什么样子？顾执中之流恐怕连影子也未见过，然而他却嗡嗡然叫嚣着：“放远距离和近距离的”。华尔街战争贩子们招收了一名信奉者，大约可以自慰；而顾执中仇恨共产党的心情，也跃然纸上了。人们真可以想见这个以吹嘘和诈骗起家的伪君子的张牙舞爪的嘴脸，听得见他的咬碎牙齿的声音。
    绝顶的狂妄也就是绝顶的愚蠢。真的导弹尚且救不了华尔街的战争贩子，想像里的导弹又怎么能给右派分子带来什么好处？
    陆诒在上海开始交代了顾执中同王造时的阴谋活动，这位导弹英雄说：“我被陆诒出卖了。”尽管出卖顾执中的，其实还是他自己，但是陆诒的交代，也可以算是一颗不远不近的导弹，且看顾执中还想往哪里躲？
