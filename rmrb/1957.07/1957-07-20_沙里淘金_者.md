    "Gold Panner"
    Zou Difan
    The congress unfolds the struggle,
    Counterattacking the rightists' words and deeds.
    This comrade's attitude
    Is "calm" as if frozen.
    "Could it be that he is completely wrong?
    There should always be gold to be panned from the sand!"
    "He said let a hundred flowers bloom,
    Do not want the Party's leadership.
    Of course, this is wrong.
    He also wants the Party to be at ease, to tolerate,
    Advocating to speak out but not to contend.
    "He scolds personnel units
    As being equal to public security departments.
    Although the language is slanderous,
    It proves the opinion is in his heart.
    Scholars talk boastfully,
    Not distinguishing between flies and elephants."
    "Gold panning," how good it sounds,
    Like blue sky, blue waves, seagulls singing.
    The rightists want to drill through the bottom of the ship,
    If the ship sinks to the bottom, who will pan for gold?
    Who do the seagulls sing for above and below?
    Seagulls, seagulls,
    Originally do not have a heart that loves socialism,
    What about you, person who "pans for gold"?

    “沙里淘金”者
    邹荻帆
    大会展开斗争，
    反击右派言行。
    这位同志的态度
    “冷静”有如寒冰。
    “难道他全盘讲错，
    总该沙里淘金！
    “他说百花齐放，
    不要党的领导。
    当然这是错误。
    他也要党放心、容忍，
    主张鸣而不争。
    “他骂人事单位
    等于公安部门。
    虽然语言诬蔑，
    足证意见在心。
    文人夸夸其谈，
    苍蝇大象不分。”
    “沙里淘金”，多好听，
    好似蓝天碧波海鸥鸣。
    右派要凿穿海船底，
    船沉海底谁淘金？
    海鸥上下为谁唱，
    海鸥、海鸥，
    本来没有爱社会主义的心，
    你呢，“沙里淘金”的人？
