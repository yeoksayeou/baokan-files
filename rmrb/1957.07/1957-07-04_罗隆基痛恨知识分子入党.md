    Luo Longji Hated Intellectuals Joining the Party
    Finally, Qian Jiaju read a letter from Luo Longji's secretary, Shao Ciyun, to Shen Junru and the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. The letter said: Luo Longji's dissatisfaction with the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement had a long history. His plan to "rehabilitate" those labeled as counter-revolutionaries was not just a spur of the moment thing that began from the United Front Department's symposium. As early as last year, after he made a speech on the issue of intellectuals at the National People's Congress, he received many letters from so-called "victims of injustice" during the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement. When he went to Sichuan for inspection, he also attached great importance to this issue. He even met with Chen Kun, who was persecuted during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement at the Chengdu Institute of Technology, and took Chen's letter back. At the symposium of the CPPCC's Intellectuals Group this spring, which he chaired, he also emphasized the backward side of intellectuals, exaggerating the heavy concerns of intellectuals due to the "effect of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement." After the symposium of intellectuals, he collected 14 letters requesting so-called "appeals for justice" and submitted them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for processing. Luo Longji attached great importance to these people's letters. He wanted me to learn from Huang Shaohong's method of handling letters from "appellants," summarizing and organizing all the letters for him.
    The letter said: Regarding the issue of intellectuals joining the Party, Luo Longji's dissatisfaction was not only expressed in words, but also in actions. His attitude of suppressing my efforts to join the Party is a clear example. After I came to work at the Ministry of Forestry last year, he hoped that I would join the China Democratic League and always suppressed my desire to join the Party. He tempted me with the idea that it was easier for China Democratic League members to obtain high positions because there were fewer of them, and also ridiculed me by saying that not joining the China Democratic League meant being politically and ideologically backward. He also said that joining the China Democratic League would not hinder joining the Party. However, because his motives for persuading me to join the China Democratic League were impure, I felt repulsed. Therefore, the issue of joining the China Democratic League was put on hold. As for Luo Longji? He became angry and ashamed because his ministerial authority could not conquer a secretary, and gradually became dissatisfied with me. On March 2nd of this year, Luo Longji lost his temper with me in the office over a trivial matter. He scolded me, and when I tried to explain, he became furious and said, "You are quibbling, you are still not convinced, do you want to do this job or not?" He even went so far as to slam the table, throw his briefcase, and shout, "Go to the cipher room and get Shao Ciyun's file to check." Later, he nitpicked at my mistakes, often not answering my phone calls, and when I asked for instructions, he said that I had become his superior and that he had no obligation to report to me. When giving instructions, he would also stare and raise his eyebrows. When he couldn't find fault with my work, he would turn to my personal life. When I went to the hospital for a tooth problem and needed surgery, I called Secretary Sun and asked him to ask the Minister for leave for me, but it was not approved. He wrote in large letters on the calendar: "Shao is not at work, nor has he asked for leave." After I returned to work after the surgery, I was severely reprimanded. For the past two or three months, I have been treated almost inhumanly. If it weren't for the sympathy of my colleagues and the understanding of the organization, I don't know if I would still be here today? But the problem did not end there. In early May, when he learned from Zhao Wenbi's report that I was attending Party classes and had a desire to join the Party, he aggressively asked Zhao Wenbi, "Shao must be attending Party classes because of Sun Pingyi, I will definitely make sure he can't join the Party." Then, on the morning of May 6th, without announcing any reason, he checked my file with Secretary Sun Pingyi and closed the door to learn about my Party class attendance from Sun Pingyi. That afternoon, he scolded me in a stern voice: "You don't participate in the China Democratic League, your political ideology is backward, and you still want to join the Party? This is opportunistic behavior. You value the Party over the China Democratic League. I will make sure you can't join the Party in the Ministry." This proves that his statement that joining the China Democratic League does not hinder joining the Party was a lie.
    Immediately after checking my historical files, Luo Longji resolutely stopped the organization from solving my younger brother's employment problem (which I had requested from the Personnel Department after he agreed). He told his nurse to tell me that he wanted to fire me, and told Director Zhao Wenbi (a China Democratic League member and Deputy Director of the General Office of our ministry) to tell me that even if I asked to join the China Democratic League, he would not want me. In addition, he often closed the door in the office and talked with Zhao Wenbi and others, guarding against me like a "little secret agent." The situation developed to the point where he wouldn't talk to me, but instead had Zhao Wenbi convey messages, and even had the waiter tell me when giving work instructions. I really don't know if I was working as a secretary or as a "prisoner."
    Why did Luo Longji change from caring about me to hating me? After Zhao Wenbi's analysis, I suddenly understood. Zhao Wenbi said:
    1. Luo Longji believes that we are his people and should be close to him and listen to him. You must understand that you must be completely obedient to him, but you are not close to him, but instead are close to the Party organization.
    2. You are not active in joining the China Democratic League and want to join the Party, which Luo is not satisfied with. He is afraid that the Party will buy you off, and that after you join the Party, you will report the situation to the Party, and he himself has problems, so he cannot but have concerns.
    3. There are many contradictions between the China Democratic League and the Party. This is a political struggle. You are young, too naive, and easily believe what others say. You don't understand the complexity of officialdom.
    Zhao Wenbi warned me not to casually pass on messages when doing this kind of secretarial work.
    After that, Luo Longji's attitude towards me became even worse. He put blatant pressure on me with the force of Mount Tai. He even said: "Don't think I don't dare to fire you. I dare not dismiss you? If I, as a minister, cannot fire you, then I am a minister in name only." Until the eve of his trip to Ceylon, he left me with the instruction: "Your problem, I'll talk about it when I get back!"
    The letter said: Luo Longji's reactionary words and deeds are not accidental. Although he has received the greatest trust and the highest treatment from the Party and the people, he still has ulterior motives against the Party. This has long been revealed in his daily words and deeds. As early as before taking office as Minister of Forestry, he complained about his lack of success, saying: "People like us are just decorations. Of course, I can work in the foreign affairs department, but they won't trust me to do it. I'm just there to welcome and send off people, with my name on the report..." When he went to Sichuan in December last year to inspect forestry work, he was deeply moved by the relatively simple material life in the local area. He said to me: "The most ideal situation for a person in a communist country to be an official is to live in a capitalist country." According to Zhao Wenbi, Luo's thinking is that he is not satisfied with being the Minister of Forestry. He once told Zhao Wenbi: "The government gave me the Ministry of Forestry, but I don't understand the business. In fact, it would be more appropriate to let me run the Ministry of Justice." His views on the Zhang Dongsun incident also revealed his dissatisfaction. He said that Zhang Dongsun's giving the national budget to the United States in those years was wrong, because the budget was not public at that time, but what about now? The budget is published in the newspaper, and the implication is that he feels sorry for Zhang Dongsun, as if it wouldn't matter if Zhang Dongsun did this today.

### 罗隆基痛恨知识分子入党

    罗隆基痛恨知识分子入党
    最后，千家驹宣读了罗隆基的秘书邵慈云给沈钧儒和民盟中央的信，信中说：关于三反、肃反问题，罗隆基的不满由来已久，想为那些反革命分子“平反”的蓄谋也不是自统战部座谈开始。早在去年人民代表大会上，他作了有关知识分子问题的发言后，就收到不少三反、肃反中的所谓“冤屈者”的来信。去四川视察的时候，也很重视这个问题。并曾接见成都工学院肃反被斗者陈堃，将陈的信带回。今春在他主持下的政协知识分子小组座谈会上，也是强调知识分子落后的一面，夸大知识分子的顾虑重重是由于“肃反的作用”。知识分子座谈会后，他将所有要求所谓“申冤”的来信十四件集中送交人大常委会处理。罗隆基对这些人的来信是很重视的，他要我学习黄绍竑处理“申冤”者来信的办法处理，把所有的来信都摘要整理给他。
    信中说：关于知识分子入党问题，罗隆基的不满情绪，同样不仅表现在言论上，并已见诸了行动，他对待我争取入党问题所采取的打击态度，即是一个明显的例证。去年我来森工部工作后，他希望我入盟，并对我入党愿望一直给以压抑，他曾以盟员少入盟容易获得高位等对我诱惑，又以不入盟即是政治思想落后对我讽刺。也讲过入盟不妨碍入党的话，由于他劝我入盟的动机不纯，使我起反感，因此，入盟问题，便无形拖下来，而罗隆基呢？由于他的部长威严不能征服一个秘书而恼羞成怒，于是渐渐对我不满。本年3月2日，罗隆基为一点小事，在办公室里大发我的脾气，他骂我，我加以解释，他即大怒，说：“你狡辩，你还不服，你是不是想做这个工作？”甚至发展到拍桌子，摔皮包，大叫“到机要室去拿邵慈云的档案来查”。后来，他就吹毛求疵的找我的错处，往往是我打电话不接，请示工作则说我成了他的上司，他没有义务向我汇报，指示工作时也吹胡子瞪眼睛，当工作找不到岔子，就转向生活方面挑剔。我因牙病去医院，需开刀，我打电话给孙秘书，请代向部长给我请假，不准，并在日历牌上大书：“邵不上班，亦未请假”，等我开完刀上班后，又受到痛斥。二、三个月来，我几乎受着非人的待遇，假使不是同事们对我的同情以及组织上的了解，我真不知道今天是否还有我存在？但问题并未就此而止，5月初，当他从赵文璧汇报中，知道我在听党课并有了入党愿望后，竟气势凶凶地问赵文璧、“邵听党课一定是孙平毅搞的，我一定叫他入不了党”，随即在5月6日一上班，未宣布任何理由，即向孙平毅秘书查阅我的档案，并关上房门向孙平毅了解我听党课的情况，同日下午并声色俱厉地骂我：“你不参加民盟，你的政治思想落后，你还想入党，这是投机行为，你重党轻盟，我叫你在部入不了党。”这证明他说入盟不妨碍入党是假话。
    紧接着查我历史档案后，罗隆基一方面断然制止组织上给我弟弟解决工作问题（系他同意后，我才向人事司请求的），叫他的护士告诉我，他要开除我，叫赵文璧主任（盟员、我部办公厅副主任）告诉我即使我请求入盟他也不要我。另外还在办公室中经常关起房门来与赵文璧等人谈话，把我防得像个“小特务”一样。情况发展到他不和我讲话，倒要赵文璧作传达，甚至指示工作时叫服务员告诉我，我真不知道我在作秘书，还是在当“囚犯”。
    罗隆基对我为什么由关心变为痛恨呢，经过赵文璧的分析，才使我恍然大悟。赵文璧说：
    一、罗隆基认为我们是他的人，应该靠拢他，听他的话，你必须了解，对他百依百顺，而你不靠拢他，反向党组织靠拢。
    二、你对入盟不积极，又想入党，罗不满意。怕党收买你，怕你入党后，向党反映情况，而他自己有毛病，不能不有所顾虑。
    三、盟与党间矛盾很多，这是政治斗争，你年青，太天真，容易轻信别人的话，不懂官场上事情的复杂。
    赵文璧告诫我做这种秘书工作不能随便传话。
    此后，罗隆基对我的态度更为恶劣，他以泰山当顶的压力对我进行露骨的威胁，他甚至说：“你别以为我不敢开除你，我不敢撤你的职，我作部长不能开除你，我这部长算白当了”。直到去锡兰前夕还留给我一句指示是：“你的问题，我回来再说！”
    信中说：罗隆基的反动言行不是偶然的，虽然他是受到党和人民的最大信任和最高待遇，但他还对党有二心的，这在他平日的言行中早有流露，早在就任森工部长前，他对自己不得志即发过牢骚说：“我们这些人不过是陈设品，外交部门工作，我当然能做，但他们不会放心叫我做的，我只不过是送往迎来，名字上上报……”去年12月到四川视察森林工作时，他由于地方物质生活较简陋，而大发感慨，他对我说：“一个人在共产党国家作官，到资本主义国家生活最理想”。据赵文璧对我讲罗的思想中，对任森工部长是不满意的，他曾对赵文璧讲：“政府给我森工部，我也不懂业务，其实不如叫我搞司法部还恰当些”。他对张东荪事件的看法上，也显露出他的不满。他说张东荪当年把国家预算交给美国是错误，因当时预算未公开，而现在呢？预算是在报纸上公布，言下之意，颇有为张东荪抱屈，好像张东荪要是在今天这样做，就不要紧了。
