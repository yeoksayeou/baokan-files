Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 10th: Twenty-seven counties in Guangxi Province, including Yishan, Wuming, and Tiandong, are currently constructing thirty-nine small-scale manganese, lead, tungsten, antimony, and gold mines. These small mines, which were successively built starting in May and June, require little investment and simple equipment but yield quick results and high profits. For example, the thirteen mines, including the Tongzheng Lead-Zinc Mine in Fusui County, only required a total investment of 186,000 yuan, but are expected to generate an annual profit of more than 1,694,400 yuan, exceeding the investment by about eight times. The manganese mine in the whole county invested 10,000 yuan, and the profit recovered this year is equal to 30 times the investment. The Tiandong Antimony Mine and Tianyang Antimony Mine, with an investment of 25,000 yuan in both mines, can also generate a profit of 800,000 yuan annually, exceeding the investment by 31 times.

Guangxi Province has many types of minerals, and the distribution area is very wide; however, the reserves are generally not large, which is suitable for small-scale local mining.

    广西兴建三十九个小矿场
    据新华社南宁10日电　广西省宜山、武鸣、田东等二十七个县，目前正在建设三十九个小型的锰、铅、钨、锑、金矿。从5、6月份先后建设的这批小矿场，投资少，设备简单，但收效快，利润大。如扶绥县同正铅锌矿等十三个矿场，总共投资才一十八万六千元，预计每年可收利润一百六十九万四千多元，超过投资八倍左右。全县锰矿投资一万元，今年收回的利润就等于投资的三十倍。田东锑矿和田阳锑矿，两矿投资二万五千元，每年也可收入利润八十万元，超过投资的三十一倍。
    广西省矿种多，分布面积很广；但储量多是不大，宜于地方小规模开采。
