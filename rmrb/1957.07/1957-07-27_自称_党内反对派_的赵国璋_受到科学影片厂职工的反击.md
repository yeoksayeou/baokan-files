    Shanghai News: Employees of the Shanghai Science and Educational Film Studio, affiliated with the Shanghai Film Company, exposed the serious crimes of Zhao Guozhang, a rightist within the Party who has consistently taken pride in being anti-Party and anti-leadership. Many materials revealed at the meeting showed that Zhao Guozhang, as a Communist Party member, not only failed to fulfill his obligations as a Party member but, on the contrary, exaggerated shortcomings in his work to attack the Party in every possible way, openly declaring, "I am an opposition派 within the Party."
    Speakers pointed out that Zhao Guozhang's anti-Party activities were targeted and had slogans. Zhao's targets were Li Ziqing, the deputy director and secretary of the Party branch, and the head of the personnel section, among others. Zhao's slogans were: "Drive away Li Ziqing, remove Hu Jingyuan (chairman of the labor union), and re-elect the Party branch." Zhao wrote an article on the blackboard newspaper entitled "Who is the Defender?", falsely claiming that branch secretary Li Ziqing threatened him with a pistol, distorting Li Ziqing to be almost like a "Gestapo." The aim was "to ruin Director Li's reputation." Zhao also referred to the five Party branch committee members and two other responsible comrades in the factory as the "Five Tiger Generals and Two Warriors," and labeled all the activists as accomplices. Zhao Guozhang was not only opposing individual leaders but the entire Party organization and Party leadership. He once slandered the Science Film Studio's Party branch as being inferior to Catholic priests, saying, "Priests can make believers unconditionally confess to them, but the Science Film's Party branch cannot make Party members unconditionally expose their thoughts." He also said, "I don't trust the Party branch, so I have the right not to recognize it, and I can refuse to carry out its resolutions." When Lin Lin, secretary of the Shanghai Film Studio Party Committee, spoke to him, he was refused and replied with an ultimatum-like letter, indicating that he would see him in the Wenhui Daily.
    Speakers also exposed Zhao's anti-Party activities during the "blooming and contending" process. He incited the masses to make trouble everywhere, saying to some who were dissatisfied with the Party: "You have been persecuted in the past, now you can speak out, I support you." Regardless of the opposition from the Party and the masses, he repeatedly insisted on establishing a "counter-revolutionary suppression inspection group" and encouraged others who had opinions on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to fight for it, saying, "I am not afraid within the Party, but you are afraid." Even when the parties involved did not approve of this proposal, Zhao still insisted on it alone. In May of this year, Zhao Guozhang was "entrusted" by the Wenhui Daily to organize a symposium for Science Film Studio personnel. At the meeting, Zhao divided the cadres of the Science Film Studio into three types: "red people, white people, and black people." Red people were those who leaned towards the Party, white people were those who liked to offer opinions and stand up for justice and were therefore not valued by the leaders, and black people were those who were forgotten by the leaders, viciously provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses.
    Those present unanimously agreed that Zhao Guozhang had tarnished the title of Communist Party member and had become a rightist within the Party. His anti-Party words and deeds will continue to be exposed.

    自称“党内反对派”的赵国璋  受到科学影片厂职工的反击
    本报上海讯　23日下午，上海电影公司所属上海科学教育电影制片厂职工，揭发了一贯以反党反领导为荣的党内右派分子赵国璋的严重罪行。会上揭发的许多材料都说明身为共产党员的赵国璋，不但不能履行党员的义务，相反的无孔不入地夸大工作中的缺点向党攻击，公开地宣称“我是党内的反对派。”
    发言者指出，赵国璋的反党活动是有目标有口号的，赵的打击目标是副厂长兼党支部书记李资清和人事科长等人，赵的口号是：“赶跑李资清，搬掉胡景远（工会主席），改选党支部。”赵曾在黑板报上写过一篇“防者何人”，无中生有地说支部书记李资清用手枪威胁他。把李资清歪曲得简直和“盖世太保”差不多。目的是“要把李厂长搞臭”。赵还把厂内的五位党支委和另二位责负同志说成是“五虎二将”，并把所有的积极分子说成是为虎作伥。赵国璋不但是反对个别领导人，而是反对整个党的组织和党的领导，他曾污蔑科影厂的党支部不如天主教的神父，说：“神父可以使教徒无条件地向他忏悔，而科影的党支部却不能使党员无条件地暴露思想。”他还说：“我对党支部不信任，我就有权不承认它，它的决议我就可以不执行。”上海电影制片公司党委书记林琳同志找他谈话，也被拒绝，并回答了一封最后通牒式的信，表示要在文汇报上见。
    发言者又揭发了赵在“鸣、放”过程中的反党活动。他到处煽动群众闹事，向某些对党不满的人说：“过去你受过迫害，现在可以放了，我支持你。”他不顾党和群众的反对，一再坚持要成立“肃反检查小组”，并鼓励其他对肃反有意见的人力争，说“我在党内都不怕，你们倒怕起来了”。甚至连当事人都不赞成这个主张时，赵还独自坚持。今年5月间，赵国璋曾受文汇报的“委托”，组织过一次科影人员的座谈会，会上赵把科影的干部分做“红人、白人、黑人”三种，红人就是靠拢党的人，白人就是好提意见、爱打抱不平因而不受领导重视的人，黑人是被领导遗忘的人，恶毒地挑拨党和群众的关系。
    到会的人一致认为赵国璋已经玷污了共产党员的称号，成了党内的右派分子，对于他的反党言行，还将继续进行揭发。
