Rightists' Illusions About Disaster Areas Completely Shattered
    In his speech, Guan Wenwei said: Every socialist achievement is a disaster for rightists. This is the fundamental reason why they talk nonsense with their eyes closed.
    I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Chief Procurator Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng.
    From Premier Zhou's report, we can see that China's construction achievements in 1956 were enormous. Many important projects have exceeded the targets of the Five-Year Plan. This is the result of the hard work of the 600 million people of the country, and it should be highlighted and widely publicized. This is a great encouragement to the working people of the country. In the process of construction, we inevitably made some mistakes due to lack of experience. If we compare these shortcomings with the achievements, is the statement "the achievements are enormous and the shortcomings are very small" in line with the objective situation last year? It is entirely in line with it. The rightist gentlemen do not admit this, they say it is a so-called "dogma". Why do the rightists want to call this a "dogma"? This is because every socialist achievement is a disaster for them. This is the fundamental reason why they want to talk nonsense with their eyes closed.
    Last year's work achievements were great, which the rightist gentlemen cannot deny. This is true for the whole country, and it is also true for our Jiangsu. Without talking about other work, taking Jiangsu's production and disaster relief work as an example, this can fully prove this point.

    Last Year's Disaster in Jiangsu Was Very Serious
    Last year's disaster in Jiangsu was very serious. Since May, it has been continuously attacked by natural disasters such as torrential rain, strong typhoons, hail, and tornadoes, and the waterlogging situation was serious. The annual rainfall reached 1,288 millimeters, which is rare in decades. The rainfall from May to September alone reached 1,050 millimeters, exceeding the rainfall of 888 millimeters during the same period of the great flood in 1954 by 20%, and greatly exceeding the rainfall during the same period in 1931. Therefore, the losses suffered by summer and autumn crops were very large. Among the 83 counties and cities in the province, 52 counties and cities were affected by the disaster, and the affected area of 94 million mu of farmland reached more than 47 million mu, of which the disaster-stricken area of autumn crops was more than 30.23 million mu, exceeding 42% of the disaster-stricken farmland in 1954. More than 20 million people and cadres in the disaster-stricken areas fought against the storms day and night, temporarily digging 88,100 large and small drainage ditches, and reinforcing more than 23 million cubic meters of earth and stone for embankments. Many areas experienced three floods and three drainages, or four drainages and four sowings. Without the organized labor force after the collectivization, it would be difficult to overcome such a serious flood. Although we have made every effort to save more than 15.6 million mu of crops from losses, thus striving for a year of normal harvest, the reduced harvest caused by the flood is still quite serious. More than 5.4 million mu of farmland in the province suffered a reduction of more than 50% or no harvest, more than 27 million mu suffered varying degrees of reduction, and there were more than 9.46 million severely and lightly affected people.

    Right-Wingers Gloated Over the Disaster
    After the disaster formed, the bourgeois rightists in our province held a gloating attitude, thinking that the Communist Party and the People's Government had no way to deal with such a big disaster. They deliberately exaggerated the disaster situation and carried out distorted propaganda everywhere, intending to take advantage of the fire. We refuted their distorted propaganda with facts, and also told them with facts that we must have a way to overcome the disaster. Of course, last year's disaster was serious, which brought great difficulties to various tasks in our province. Overcoming natural disasters has become a major task that the party, government, army and people of the province must undertake. To this end, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee regarded doing a good job in production and disaster relief as the central task that overrides everything else last winter and this spring. Thanks to the strong support of the central government and the unity of the people of the province, after more than half a year of hard work, we have completely overcome this serious disaster. We have not failed the expectations of more than 9 million disaster victims. Now, the severe disaster has passed safely, the social order in the disaster areas has always been very stable, no one has starved to death, grain prices have not fluctuated, and the production enthusiasm of the disaster victims has always been very high. The rightists' expectations have all failed. They believe that after the disaster, the peasants must leave us, a chaotic situation must appear in the countryside, and even riots will occur. However, the facts are contrary to what the rightist gentlemen think.

    Overcoming Disaster Under the Strong Leadership of the Communist Party
    We were able to successfully overcome the disaster by relying on the strong leadership of the Communist Party. After the disaster formed, party and government organs at all levels went all out, transferred outstanding party members, cadres and non-party cadres, and organized people from all walks of life to go deep into the disaster areas to conduct widespread disaster investigation and condolences, and help lower levels solve specific difficulties in a timely manner. Provincial organs, headed by Comrade Liu Shunyuan, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Hui Yuyu, the governor of the province, led a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to inspect work and help solve specific difficulties when the disaster was severe. The Huaiyin area conducted three disaster investigations around the Spring Festival, with more than 10,000 cadres at the township level and above participating in each disaster investigation. Whenever it snowed, they braved the wind and snow to visit door to door to help solve difficulties. For example, Xue Zhizhong, secretary of the Libao District Committee of the Haian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, braved the heavy snow, carried 200 yuan of relief money, went deep into the townships and teams to visit each household, and solved the difficulties of 25 poor households who were about to run out of food and were not usually paid attention to. In Sireny District of Siyang County, 180 district and township cadres braved the snow to deliver grain and grass to the victims. In Chahe District of Huaian County, 24 township and commune cadres took out more than 1,200 jin of food they had saved, more than 8,000 jin of firewood, and more than 200 yuan in cash to solve the difficulties of 537 victims who lacked clothing, food, or grass. Such examples are not isolated in various places, but many. The selfless and caring behavior of party and government cadres, especially grassroots cadres, towards the disaster victims has been widely supported and praised by the people in the disaster areas. Counties and districts above the disaster areas have also generally transferred a large number of capable cadres to the countryside, adopting the method of assigning people to townships and communes to help the townships and communes in the disaster areas do a good job in production and disaster relief; cadres in townships and agricultural cooperatives have also implemented the method of subcontracting teams and households to directly lead the masses in production for self-salvation. These cadres can share weal and woe with the disaster victims and overcome the disaster together. Facts have proved that without the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the joint efforts of a large number of grassroots cadres who seem to have a low level of education but can still save others in any difficult situation, it would be unimaginable to overcome such a serious disaster. We have always had such experience: where the party's leadership is strong, the work is done well; where the party's leadership is poor, the work will be poor; if there is no party leadership there, it will become moldy and even rotten. Some of the shortcomings that occurred in our production and disaster relief work, such as insufficient understanding of the situation, unrealistic disaster relief plans, untimely distribution of disaster relief funds, and even malfeasance, are mainly due to the lack of strong party leadership there. The rightist gentlemen oppose the leadership of our party, and from the above examples, we can know what they are doing.

    The People in the Disaster Areas Were Moved to Tears by the Party
    We were able to successfully overcome the disaster, in addition to relying on the efforts of the people of the province, it is inseparable from the support of the central government and relevant business departments. From last summer to the end of May this year, the state allocated a total of 58.47 million yuan of disaster relief funds to our province, accounting for 52% of the total amount of 114.1 million yuan of disaster relief funds in the seven years after liberation, more than three times that of 1954. More than 200 million jin of wheat seeds were transferred from various places to four areas including Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, and Yangzhou; 1.95093 billion jin of grain, so that the victims can get about one jin of grain per person per day. Due to the timely supply of grain in the disaster areas, the grain prices are stable, which plays a great role in stabilizing people's hearts and supporting production. Without the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale, it would be impossible to transfer so much grain to the disaster areas. The rightists oppose the policy of unified purchase and sale, and from the above examples, we can know what they are saying. In order to help the victims overcome the difficulty of insufficient firewood, the state also transferred 210,000 tons of coal to supply the people in the disaster areas of the province when the coal supply was relatively tight. The state bank issued a total of 53 million yuan of production and living loans in the disaster areas. Commercial and supply and marketing departments invested 56.82 million yuan of pre-purchase deposits for agricultural products in the disaster areas, and timely supplied agricultural production materials and sideline production raw materials; appropriately adjusted the purchase prices of sideline products, so that the disaster victims increased their income by more than 3.57 million yuan. The financial department implemented tax reductions and exemptions for the sideline products operated by the disaster victims, so that the disaster victims increased their income by more than 1.2 million yuan. The transportation departments overcame difficulties such as rain, snow and freezing, and timely transferred and guaranteed the supply of grain, fuel and sideline production raw materials in the disaster areas. The Communist Party and relevant departments' tremendous help to the disaster victims cannot but make the people in the disaster areas grateful to tears. On behalf of the people in the disaster areas of Jiangsu, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the central government and relevant departments!

    Agricultural Cooperativization Played a Huge Role
    We were able to successfully overcome the disaster, and agricultural cooperativization also played a huge role. Relying on the great power of the masses organized, not only rescued 15.6 million mu of crops from waterlogging, but also had much better conditions for production and disaster relief after the disaster than in the past. Some work cannot be done by the small-scale peasant economy. For example, the Cangji Agricultural Cooperative in Siyang County went through three floods, three drainages, and four plantings, and finally achieved an average yield of 216 jin per mu of late autumn crops; the Xianjin No. 1 Cooperative in Donghai County had a low-lying area of more than 1,000 mu, which was usually not harvested for nine years out of ten. Last year, after two days and nights of collective drainage, the average harvest per mu was still more than 110 jin of wheat; there are many such examples. The Subei area has often suffered from natural disasters before and after liberation, and the peasants have a very deep understanding of the superiority of cooperativization from their actual life struggles. Through last year's disaster relief work, a large number of individual farmers in the disaster areas requested to transfer to agricultural cooperatives. The victims said: "Without cooperatives, it would be impossible to overcome last year's disaster." They recalled that during the great flood in 1931, the Subei Canal breached, and more than 100,000 people drowned and 70,000 to 80,000 people starved to death in Lixiahe; in 1921, during the great flood in Guoji Township, Tongshan County, more than 200 people starved to death in Taoyuan Village of the township; in 1931, during the great flood in the Heping No. 4 Cooperative of Lireny District, Huaiyin County, 61 people starved to death in two villages; as for tragic examples such as selling wives and daughters, they can be seen and heard almost everywhere. The severity of last year's disaster was much greater than in the past, but relying on the collective strength of the cooperatives, the tragic examples mentioned above did not happen at all. This was simply unimaginable in the old society. However, the rightist gentlemen turned a blind eye to the facts and said that the cooperatives were not good and the peasants did not welcome them. They seized on some shortcomings of the cooperatives and exaggerated these shortcomings, insisting that the cooperatives were "screwed up." What is this for? Naturally, they have their purposes.

    Rightists Are Bound to Be Crushed Under the Wheels of History
    Now, the disaster in our Jiangsu has been successfully overcome. The rightists estimated that after such a serious disaster occurred, a chaotic situation must appear in the countryside. This estimate has completely gone bankrupt, and the rightist gentlemen can only be disappointed. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, we have a clearer understanding of the bright future of our great motherland. We must build our country into a strong socialist industrial country in three Five-Year Plans or a longer period of time. We can overcome the current difficulties, and as long as we work hard, we will have a bright future.

    I want to warn the rightists: "You must know that the painful historical lessons of the past hundred years tell us that our motherland cannot achieve the victory of the revolution or be built into a strong industrial country without the leadership of the Communist Party. Your attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party is a crime against the people of the country."

    "The Communist Party of China has grown up in arduous struggles, and it has very rich leadership experience and work experience. With it, the motherland will not lose its direction; with it, the motherland will have no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The people of the country are united around it, which is the greatest interest of the people of the country."

    Our people's democratic regime is very consolidated, and you don't want to overthrow it. Your hope that a chaotic situation will appear in China is just a fantasy in your mind! If you want to pull the wheel of Chinese history backward, you are bound to be crushed under the wheels of history!

### 右派分子对灾区的幻想彻底破灭了

专栏：

    右派分子对灾区的幻想彻底破灭了
    管文蔚的发言中说：社会主义每一个成就，对右派分子都是灾难，这就是他们闭着眼睛瞎说一顿的根本原因。
    我完全同意周总理、李薄两副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的报告。
    从周总理的报告中可以看出，我国在一九五六年的建设成绩是巨大的。有许多重要的项目已经超过了五年计划的指标。这是全国六亿人民辛勤劳动的结果，应该大书而特书，应该广泛的宣传。这对全国劳动人民的鼓舞是很大的。在建设当中，我们也由于经验不足，不可避免的发生一些缺点。如果拿这些缺点和成绩比较起来，“成绩是巨大的，缺点是很小的”。这句话合不合乎去年的客观情况呢？是完全符合的。右派先生们不承认这句话，他们说这是一种所谓“教条”。右派先生为什么要把这句话说成是“教条”呢？这就是社会主义每一个成就，对他们都是灾难，这就是他们要闭着眼睛瞎说一顿的根本原因。
    去年一年的工作成绩是伟大的，右派先生是否认不了的，全国如此，我们江苏同样是如此。其他工作不讲，就拿江苏的生产救灾工作为例，就可以充分证明这一点。
    去年江苏灾情非常严重
    去年江苏的灾情是非常严重的。自五月份以后，连续遭到暴雨、强台风、冰雹、龙卷风等自然灾害的袭击，内涝情况严重。全年雨量达一千二百八十八公厘，为数十年来所罕见。其中五到九月份的雨量即高达一千零五十公厘，超过一九五四年大水年头同期雨量八百八十八公厘的百分之二十，更大大超过一九三一年同期的雨量。因而夏秋季作物遭受的损失是很大的。全省八十三个县、市中受灾的有五十二个县、市，九千四百万亩农田中受灾面积达到四千七百余万亩，其中秋季作物成灾面积就有三千零二十三万亩，超过一九五四年成灾田亩的百分之四十二。受灾地区的二千余万群众和干部，不分日夜的与狂风暴雨搏斗，临时挖掘大小排水沟八万八千一百多条，加固堤防土方二千三百多万公方。不少地区三涝三排或四排四种。如果没有合作化以后组织起来的劳动大军，要想战胜这样严重的水灾，是困难的。我们虽经过了一切努力，抢救出一千五百六十余万亩农作物不受损失，从而争取到一个平收的年成，但水灾所造成的歉收情况还是相当严重的。全省农田受灾减产五成以上和颗粒无收的五百四十多万亩，不同程度减产的二千七百余万亩，轻重灾民九百四十六万余人。
    右派分子幸灾乐祸
    在灾荒形成以后，我省的资产阶级右派分子抱着幸灾乐祸的态度，认为这样大的灾荒，共产党和人民政府是没有办法了。他们曾经故意把灾情夸大起来，到处进行歪曲宣传，意图趁火打劫。我们用事实驳斥了他们的歪曲宣传，也用事实告诉他们：我们是一定有办法战胜灾荒的。当然，去年的灾荒是严重的，给我省各项工作带来了极大的困难，战胜自然灾害就成为全省党政军民必须承担的一项重大任务。为此，中共江苏省委和江苏省人民委员会把做好生产救灾工作作为去冬今春压倒一切的中心任务。由于中央的大力支持和全省人民团结一致，经过半年以上的艰苦奋斗，我们已经完全战胜了这个严重的灾荒。我们没有辜负九百多万灾民对我们的期望。现在，严重的灾荒已经安渡过去了，灾区的社会秩序始终都是很平稳的，没有饿死一个人，粮价也没有波动，灾民的生产情绪始终都是很高的。右派分子的企望全部失败了。他们认为在灾荒以后农民一定要离开我们，农村一定要出现混乱状态，甚至要发生暴动事件。但是，事实和右派先生们的想法相反。
    在共产党的坚强领导下战胜灾荒
    我们能够胜利地渡过灾荒，是依靠了共产党的坚强领导。各级党政机关在灾荒形成以后，都全力以赴，抽调优秀的党员干部和非党干部，并组织各界人士，深入灾区，普遍进行查灾慰问工作，及时地帮助下级解决具体困难。省级机关以中共江苏省委书记刘顺元同志和省长惠浴宇等同志为首，都曾在灾情严重的时候，先后率领大批干部前往灾区检查工作和帮助解决具体困难。淮阴专区在春节前后即进行了三次查灾工作，每次参加查灾的乡以上干部都在万人以上。每当雨雪封门之际，他们都冒着雨雪，挨家挨户进行访问，帮助解决困难。如中共海安县李堡区委书记薛志忠冒着大雪，携带救济款二百元，深入乡、队挨家访问，解决了平时不注意的二十五个即将断炊的困难户的困难。泗阳县里仁区一百八十个区、乡干部冒雪为灾民送粮送草，淮安县岔河区有二十四个乡、社干部拿出自己节约的口粮一千二百多斤、火草八千多斤、现金二百余元，解决了五百三十七个灾民缺衣、缺粮或缺草的困难。各地像这样的事例不是个别的，而是很多的。党政干部特别是基层干部这种舍己为人、关心和爱护灾民的行为，得到了灾区人民的普遍拥护和赞扬。灾区各县、区以上机关还普遍抽调大批得力干部下乡，采取以人定乡、定社包干到底的办法，帮助灾区的乡、社做好生产救灾工作；乡和农业社的干部，也实行分工包队、包户的办法，直接领导群众进行生产自救。这些干部下去后都能和灾民同甘共苦，共渡灾荒。事实证明：没有共产党的坚强领导，没有大批这些看来文化很低，可是在任何艰苦困难情况下，还能舍己救人的基层干部的共同努力，要战胜这样严重的灾荒是不可想像的。我们从来就有这样的经验：那里党的领导坚强，那里的工作就做得好；党的领导差些，那里的工作就要差些；如果那里没有党的领导，那里就要发霉，甚至腐烂了。我们在生产救灾工作中发生的一些缺点，如对情况了解不够，救灾规划不切实际，救灾款的发放不及时，甚至有徇私舞弊等，主要原因就是那里缺少坚强的党的领导。右派先生们反对我们党的领导，从上述事例来看，就可以知道他们是在干什么。
    灾区人民对党感激涕零
    我们能够胜利地渡过灾荒，除了依靠全省人民的努力以外，是和中央及有关业务部门的支持分不开的。从去年夏季到今年五月底止，国家拨给我省的救灾款计五千八百四十七万元，相当解放后七年救灾款总数一亿一千一百四十万元的百分之五十二，超过一九五四年三倍。从各地调到徐州、淮阴、盐城、扬州等四个专区的麦种计两亿多斤；粮食十九亿五千零九十三万斤，使灾民每人每天可以得到一斤左右粮食的供应。由于灾区粮食供应及时，粮价平稳，对稳定人心和支持生产的作用是很大的。如果没有统购统销政策的执行，要调拨这样多粮食到灾区是不可能的。右派分子反对统购统销政策，从上述例子中，就可以知道他们在说什么。为了帮助灾民克服烧草不足的困难，国家在煤炭供应比较紧张的情况下，还调运煤二十一万吨供应本省灾区人民。国家银行在灾区发放的生产和生活贷款共达五千三百万元。商业与供销等部门在灾区投放了农产品预购定金计五千六百八十二万元，并及时供应了农业生产资料和副业生产原料；适当地调整了副业产品的收购价格，使灾民增加收入三百五十七万余元。财政部门对灾民经营的副业产品实行了减免税收，使灾民增加收入一百二十多万元。交通运输部门克服了雨雪封冻等困难，及时调运和保证了灾区的粮食、燃料和副业生产原料的供应。中共及有关部门对灾民这样巨大的帮助，不能不使灾区人民感激涕零，我谨代表江苏灾区人民向中央及有关部门致以衷心的感谢！
    农业合作化发挥了巨大作用
    我们能够胜利地渡过灾荒，农业合作化也发挥了巨大作用。依靠群众组织起来的伟大力量，不仅从水涝中抢救出一千五百六十万亩农作物不受损失，而且在成灾以后，进行生产救灾的条件也较过去好得多。有些工作，靠小农经济是万万做不到的。如泗阳县仓集农业社经过三涝、三排，四种，终于使一千八百多亩晚秋作物获得平均每亩二百十六斤的产量；东海县先进一社有一块一千多亩的洼地，十年九不收，去年经过了两昼夜的集体排水，结果每亩平均还收到小麦一百一十多斤；像这样的事例很多。苏北地区在解放前后是经常遭受自然灾害的，农民从实际生活斗争中对合作化优越性的体会极为深刻。通过去年的救灾工作，灾区就有大批的单干户要求转入农业合作社。灾民们说：“没有合作社就无法渡过去年的灾荒。”他们回忆一九三一年大水时苏北运河决堤，里下河淹死十多万人，饿死七、八万人；铜山县郭集乡在一九二一年大水时，该乡桃园村就饿死二百多人；淮阴县里仁区和平第四社在一九三一年大水时，两个村就饿死六十一人；至于卖妻鬻女等悲惨事例，几乎到处都可以见到、听到。去年灾情严重的程度，比过去大得多，但是依靠合作社的集体力量，类似上面所说的悲惨事例是完全没有发生。这在旧社会简直是不能想像的事。但是，右派先生们睁着眼睛不看事实，说合作社不好，农民不欢迎。他们抓住合作社一些缺点不放，并且夸大这些缺点，硬说合作社“搞糟”了，这为了什么呢，自然是有他们的目的。
    右派分子必然要在历史车轮下面粉碎
    现在，我们江苏的灾荒已经胜利渡过了。右派分子估计在这样严重的灾荒发生以后，农村一定要出现一个混乱局面，这个估计是彻底破产了，右派先生们只有失望了。我们在听取了周总理的报告以后，更清楚的看到了我们伟大祖国的光明前途。我们要在三个五年计划或者更长一些的时间内，把我们的国家建设成为一个强大的社会主义工业国。我们能够克服目前的各种困难，只要我们辛勤的劳动，我们就有着美好的未来。
    我要正告右派分子：“你们要知道，近百年来苦痛的历史教训告诉我们，我们的祖国没有共产党的领导就不可能取得革命的胜利，也不可能建设成一个强大的工业国。你们要把共产党的领导推翻，是一种对全国人民的犯罪行为。”
    “中国共产党是在艰难困苦的斗争中长大起来的，他有非常丰富的领导经验和工作经验。有了他，祖国就不会失去方向；有了他，祖国就没有克服不了的困难。全国人民团结在他的周围，是全国人民最大的利益。”
    我们的人民民主政权是很巩固的，你们休想把他推翻。你们希望在中国出现一个混乱局面，只是你们脑子里幻想吧！你们想把中国的历史车轮拉向倒退，你们必然要在历史的车轮下面粉碎！
