    Defend the Socialist Film Industry: Changying Employees Counterattack Rightist Words and Deeds

    (Our dispatch) According to Changchun Daily, all employees of the Changchun Film Studio have launched a counterattack against rightist words and deeds.

    In the previous period, various rightist fallacies emerged in the Changchun Film Studio's Orchestra, Drama Troupe, Editing Department, and Technical Department, such as "the socialist system is not suitable for film studios," "the Party Committee should only manage Party members and should not lead the enterprise or production," and "the current factory directors cannot lead the arts and should be replaced by artists to manage the factory." Reactionary activities also appeared in some units. The orchestra was one example. Fang Zhenxiang and others in the orchestra took the opportunity of "blooming and contending" to vigorously exclude and attack the Party branch, declaring, "The Party branch leading the rectification is like a corrupt official leading the anti-corruption campaign." They also secretly researched and established a so-called "Presidium" representing "public opinion," and Fang Zhenxiang and others became members of the "Presidium." During the "blooming and contending," they not only maliciously incited the masses to attack the leadership of the Party but also used the name of the "Presidium" to exclude the leadership of the Party and the administration.

    Since the anti-rightist struggle began nationwide, the broad masses of Changying employees have also launched a wave of anti-rightist struggle. Blackboards such as "Group Voice," "Youth Friend," "Propaganda Network," and "Actor's Voice" were filled with articles refuting rightist words and deeds, lining the corridors. All the Communist Youth League members and youth of the drama troupe wrote an open letter to Fang Zhenxiang and others in the orchestra, demanding that they "thoroughly confess all the activities of the 'Presidium.'" Immediately afterward, the entire factory held three or four consecutive rallies to denounce right-wing elements. At the denunciation rallies, the masses vehemently criticized various fallacies.

    The Editing Department also held consecutive meetings to criticize and expose Duan Hongxian's reactionary words and deeds. During the "blooming and contending," Duan Hongxian spread fallacies such as "only Party members are valued, and non-Party members do not have good jobs," sowing discord between the Party and the masses. In order to attack factory leaders, he also fabricated rumors about things he thought people were not familiar with. After criticism and confrontation, Duan Hongxian admitted, "Since leaving the Party, I have always hated the Party. My anti-Party sentiment has also been consistent."

    Currently, the factory's Drama Troupe, Administrative Office, Editing Department, Production Department, Film Processing Workshop, and other units are holding separate meetings to criticize and expose rightist words and deeds.

    保卫社会主义电影事业  长影职工反击右派言行
    本报讯　据长春日报消息：长春电影制片厂全厂职工向右派言行展开了反击。
    在前一个时期，长春电影制片厂的乐团、剧团、编辑处、技术处等单位，曾出现了形形色色的右派谬论，如“社会主义制度不适合于电影制片厂”、“党委应当只管党员，不应当领导企业，领导生产”、“现在的这些厂长，不能领导艺术，应当艺术家治厂”。反动活动也在一些单位出现了。乐团就是一例。乐团的方振翔等人，借“鸣”“放”的机会，大肆进行排斥、攻击党支部的活动，他们声言：“党支部领导整风，等于贪污犯领导反贪污。”他们还经过秘密研究，成立了所谓代表“民意”的“主席团”，方振翔等人变成了“主席团”的成员。在“鸣”“放”当中，他们不仅恶毒地煽惑群众攻击了党的领导，还以“主席团”的名义排斥了党和行政的领导。
    反右派斗争在全国范围内开展以来，长影广大职工也掀起了反右派斗争的浪潮。“群声”、“青年之友”、“宣传网”、“演员呼声”等黑板报，写满了驳斥右派言行的文章摆满走廊。剧团的全体共青团员和青年，给乐团方振翔等写了一封公开信，要求他们：“把‘主席团’的一切活动彻底的坦白出来。”紧接着，全厂又连续召开了三、四次声讨右派分子大会。在声讨大会上，群众痛斥了各种谬论。
    编辑处也连续召开会议，批判、揭发了段洪先的反动言行。段洪先在“鸣”“放”时散布所谓“只有党员才被重用，非党人士没有好工作做”等谬论，挑拨党和群众的关系。为了攻击厂领导，他还挑一些他以为大家不太熟悉的事情进行造谣。经过批判、对证，段洪先承认了“自从脱党以后，一直对党仇恨。反对党的情绪，也是一贯的。”
    现在，该厂的剧团、行政处、编辑处、生产处、洗印车间等单位，正在分别召开会议，批判、揭发右派言行。
