Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 25th. The first batch of projects in the Baotou Steel Plant area, including the machine repair areas of eleven factories such as casting iron, casting steel, machine repair, forging, and metal structures, officially started construction today.

More than 5,000 employees building the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise held a groundbreaking ceremony this morning in the Baotou Steel Plant area south of the Yin Mountains and north of the Yellow River.

The machine repair area, included in the first batch of construction plans for Baotou Steel, covers an area of more than 500,000 square meters. Currently, the entire plant area is still a green grassland. In a year or two, rows of factory buildings will first appear in the machine repair area, becoming an important part of the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise. After these factories are put into production one after another, they can produce tens of thousands of kinds of castings, forgings, and machine parts made of various types of steel, undertaking all the machine maintenance and repair tasks of the entire production system from refractory materials and coking to ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling. After the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise is put into production, more than 20 kinds of heavy metal parts, such as steel ingot molds weighing more than 20 tons and large charging bells with a diameter of 5 meters, which are consumed in large quantities every year, will also be manufactured entirely by factories in this area.

Following the start of the machine repair area project, the refractory material, coking, ironmaking, and steelmaking systems of Baotou Steel will be successively constructed starting next year.

After the six factories that started construction this year in the machine repair area's eleven factories are completed ahead of schedule, in addition to serving the various production systems in the future, they will also first serve Baotou Steel's larger-scale infrastructure construction projects.

At the groundbreaking ceremony venue today, colorful flags were waving in the breeze on the grassland. Many employees who had won the title of advanced unit in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel held up the pennants they had won in Anshan to participate in the meeting.

Yang Wei, General Manager of Baotou Steel, announced at the meeting that the Baotou Steel Plant construction project had officially begun. Subsequently, Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Zaitian, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Li Zhi, Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Baotou, Xu Ke, Deputy Chief Engineer of the General Institute of Black Metallurgical Design of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, He Huiyan, the head of the troops building the Baolan Railway, and Soviet expert Zakharov all spoke at the meeting, congratulating the workers on the construction of Baotou Steel.

After the meeting, Wang Zaitian cut the ribbon and broke ground on the site of the metal structure factory that started construction today.

    社会主义工业化的重要进展
    包钢建厂工程正式动工
    新华社包头25日电　包钢厂区的第一批工程，包括铸铁、铸钢、机修、锻造、金属结构等十一个工厂的机修区，今天正式动工兴建。
    建设包头钢铁联合企业的五千多名职工，今天上午在阴山以南黄河北岸的包钢厂区，举行了建厂工程开工典礼大会。
    列入包钢首批开工计划的机修区，占地达五十多万平方公尺。目前，整个厂区还是一片绿色的草原。一、两年以后，机修区里将首先出现林立的厂房，成为包头钢铁联合企业的一个重要组成部分。这些工厂陆续投入生产以后，每年可以生产数万种铸造的、锻制的和用各种类型钢材制的机件，担当起从耐火、焦化到炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等生产系统全部的机器检修和修配任务。包头钢铁联合企业投入生产以后，每年大量消耗的重达二十多吨的钢锭模、直径五公尺的大料钟等二十多种重型的金属部件，也将全部由这个区域的工厂来制造。
    继机修区工程开工以后，包钢的耐火材料、焦化、炼铁、炼钢等系统，将从明年开始陆续施工。
    机修区十一个工厂中今年开工的六个工厂提前完工以后，除了为将来各生产系统服务以外，还将首先为包钢规模更大的基本建设工程服务。
    在今天开工典礼大会会场草地上，彩旗招展。许多曾经在鞍钢建设中荣获先进单位称号的职工们，举着他们在鞍山获得的锦旗，来参加大会。
    包钢总经理杨维在大会上宣布了包钢建厂工程正式开始。接着，中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记苏谦益，内蒙古自治区副主席王再天，中共包头市委员会书记、包头市市长李质，冶金工业部黑色冶金设计总院副总工程师徐克，以及修筑包兰铁路的部队首长何辉燕和苏联专家扎哈洛夫等都在大会上讲话，向建设包钢的职工表示祝贺。
    大会结束后，王再天在今天开工的金属结构工厂基地上，剪彩破土。
