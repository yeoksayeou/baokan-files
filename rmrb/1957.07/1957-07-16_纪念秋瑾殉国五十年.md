    Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of Qiu Jin's Martyrdom
    A Ying
    In these days of the anti-Rightist struggle, commemorating the revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin, who sacrificed herself for the country fifty years ago (July 15, 1907), I cannot help but first recall the two seven-character律诗 poems she wrote while in Japan, "Thoughts on a Boat on the Yellow Sea." The second poem reads:
      I hear of the battlefield of yesteryear,
      Where bloodstains still remain.
      Riding horses, I dreamed of a central plain,
      But shattered lands shame my homeland.
      No power over territorial waters brings sorrow,
      Sharpening my blade for vengeance.
      A cold wind blows across my face,
      Ten thousand clouds and mists beneath my eyes.
    This poem, published in the first issue of "Chinese Women's News" which she founded in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (1906), not only succinctly reflects the reality of China after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion of 1900, but also expresses the patriotic feelings common among the Chinese people at that time. Qiu Jin believed that the country must be saved: "Who can salvage the sinking, perilous situation? Do not lean alone on the railing in the east wind!" She would not "bear to see the colors fade from paintings, how could I let the rivers and mountains be reduced to ashes?" Therefore, she was determined: "To sacrifice this body for my compatriots," to "risk the blood of ten thousand heads, and use all my strength to turn back the universe." Such sentiments similarly reflect the common grief and patriotic feelings of Chinese patriotic poets and the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, from the First Opium War in 1840 to the nationwide liberation in 1949. We can easily cite thousands of such poems. However, this great wish, which the ancestors and martyrs expected with the sacrifice of countless heads over a long period, only began to be realized after the Chinese Communist Party led the revolution to success. The dark rule has been overthrown, and the era of such sorrowful and indignant mourning will never exist again.
    We have realized the great wish that the Chinese people had expected for a long time, sacrificing countless heads, and developed the wishes of the martyrs and ancestors to achieve a more beautiful realm—a socialist society. How should we praise the Chinese Communist Party and support socialism? However, the insane Rightist elements shouted "Communists do nothing but evil," "Communists should be killed," and "Socialism is undesirable!" Is this the voice of the patriotic people, or the insincere words of ambitious careerists with ulterior motives? Qiu Jin's poem says: "To save the perilous situation from the earth, first tell my compatriots to love the group," "loving the group" means "unity." Is this despicable behavior "loving the group" or "harming the group"? If Qiu Jin had a spirit after death, I think she would angrily raise the short sword in her hand and cut off the heads of these counter-revolutionaries!
    In the lies of the Rightist elements who deceive the people, the new China is said to be full of darkness. This reminds me of Qiu Jin's "Inaugural Statement of the Chinese Women's News." She explained the so-called "darkness":
    ...The most tragic and dangerous two
    words in the world are "darkness." Darkness
    means no right or wrong,
    no hearing or seeing, no thoughts
    or behaviors that should exist in the human world, etc. ...
    Therefore, she demanded that Chinese women have a direction, leadership, and revolution, saying, "I fear that without a direction, we will sink and drown in the huge waves and whirlpools." She opposed people who studied in the East and the West "to become translators and compradors," and opposed those who studied in the East and the West "taking Japan as a shortcut to success, and taking schools as an improved imperial examination" for the sake of profit and wealth. She believed that such methods of cultivating lackeys of the ruling class and running dogs of imperialism were not progress, but regression. Such leadership is wrong, and such a direction is also wrong. She believed that these were "darkness."
    At that time, the "National Daily" also had a short article on the "Dark Present Situation." The author pointed out that the so-called dark reality was: "Inciting flames with the wind, the weak insulting the strong, millions of gold, transferred to foreign countries, this is the darkness of the cabinet.... Drilling for loopholes, acting like dogs and flies, grinding teeth and sucking blood, tigers and wolves eating people, this is the darkness of the officialdom.... Working hard all their lives, unable to relax day and night, selling wives and children to provide for official documents, this is the darkness of the fields.... Offering marrow by peeling bones, like a fishbone stuck in the throat, foxes in power, customs officials reaping huge harvests, this is the darkness of merchants." Saying that these were "what everyone gritted their teeth and felt pained about."
    Such darkness extended all the way to the Kuomintang rule, and the depth of the darkness even increased. This was the most painful, unspeakable tragic feeling of the people at that time. However, what was the situation after liberation? These "tragic" situations have been swept away. Hunger, poverty, and unemployment have been eliminated, landlords have been eliminated, and corruption and exploitation have been eliminated. The dark situation that Qiu Jin referred to as "no right or wrong, no hearing or seeing, no thoughts or behaviors that should exist in the human world, etc.," and the lamented lackeys of the ruling class and running dogs of imperialism, have also disappeared. If China today is really as dark as the Rightist elements say, could it have created such unprecedented and earth-shattering achievements?
    Let us compare this so-called dark reality of fifty years ago with the social life of the new China! Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, what could have been achieved?
    From the social reaction after Qiu Jin was killed in Shaoxing, from the situation in which the Rightist elements have aroused the anger of the people across the country and have been met with head-on blows, and from countless historical events, we can draw a conclusion and find a law, that is, truth is always on the side of the people. Any conspiracy that violates the will of the people, even if it can deceive a few people for a while, will eventually be met with the angry and painful blows of the vast majority of people and will eventually be destroyed.
    After Qiu Jin's execution, the corrupt Qing government was immediately subjected to fierce criticism from the people across the country. Newspapers and writers across the country used great firepower to bombard the decaying and traitorous ruling fortress. The magnificent momentum even made the stubborn rulers tremble. This situation can be seen from the countless elegiac poems:
    Heartbroken seven-character poems mourn the soul, and ten thousand mouths scold the government officials.
    After all, the party leader should be punished, why does the whole country shout loudly?
    Fortunately, public opinion in eastern Zhejiang is present, and everyone cries in unison at Xuanting Market.
    The matter concerns the dangerous future of the academic world, and the whole country is shocked by the tragic death in Xuanting.
    The same head, why does the death of the gentleman cause such pain throughout the country?
    And Pei Wei's "Eulogy to Ms. Qiu Xuanqing" further explained the influence of Qiu Jin's sacrifice: "Although, since your death, I know that the development of civilized thought in the women's world of our country is flourishing like a mound, and the degree of its advancement is immeasurable. Why? Because only the unjust death of the gentleman, the pain of the gentleman's death, the more we interpret the gentleman's words, respect the gentleman's actions, the gentleman's subtle words and special actions will unknowingly occupy the minds of 200 million sisters and cannot be removed, the more evolved and advanced, the longer and more energetic, the great light of the silent women's world, its future should not be far away." Sure enough, the revolution at that time expanded its influence and accelerated its progress, and soon overthrew the Qing government.
    The reflection in literary works at that time, with poems and essays compiled into special volumes, was at least a dozen volumes. Such as "Qiu Jin" (edited by an anonymous person), "Jianhu Female Knight Qiu Jin" (edited by an anonymous person), "Tomb Inscription of Qiu Jin, the Female Knight of Jianhu" (written by Xu Zihua), "Autumn Wind and Autumn Rain" (edited by Huang Min, two volumes), "Yue Hate" (edited by Xiang Lingzi), "Qiu Jin's Poems" (edited by Wang Zhifu), "June Frost" (novel, written by Jing Guanzhi, two volumes), "Resurrection of Xuanting" (novel, written by Wusheng), "Xuanting Hate" (novel, written by Ai Min), "Legend of June Frost" (written by Ying Zongji Nu), "Legend of Xuanting Injustice" (written by Xiang Lingzi), "Legend of Xuanting Blood" (written by Xiao Lu), "Xueting Autumn Miscellaneous Drama" (written by Wu Mei), "Emerald Blood Tablet Miscellaneous Drama" (written by Long Chan Jushi), "Autumn Begonia Miscellaneous Drama" (written by Beiqiu Sanren), etc. These works all praised Qiu Jin and opposed the dark rulers, attacking the corrupt Qing government in a way that left it completely scarred. Even after the Xinhai Revolution, it was still being reflected.
    From these situations, saying that we are criticizing the Rightists who oppose socialism is excessive, it can be said that we have no position at all. Compared with the "Qiu Case" fifty years ago, it can only be said that it is far from enough. The Rightist elements already want to kill us, want to eliminate our Party, want to overthrow our socialist country, what warmth can we still have? And our literary and art circles, through concrete works, to reflect and to fight, in terms of today's actual strength, it cannot be said that it is already enough, we still need to have greater attention and more effort.
    Before Qiu Jin's execution, she wrote her last famous line: "Autumn wind and autumn rain sadden people!" The autumn atmosphere of autumn wind and autumn rain does not exist now. Such ambitions and conspiracies of Rightist elements are just a piece of "shadow" in the clear sky of today's China, but even if it is just a piece of "shadow," if it is not resolutely eliminated, it will bring us endless disasters!
    Author's note: I am unable to write due to illness, but to commemorate the Xinhai revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin, I勉成 wrote three random thoughts. My thoughts are chaotic, my emotions are difficult to calm, and I cannot speak eloquently, I hope readers will understand. (Attached picture)

### 纪念秋瑾殉国五十年

    纪念秋瑾殉国五十年
    阿英
    在反右派斗争的日子里，来纪念五十年前（1907）的7月15日为国牺牲的辛亥革命先烈秋瑾，不由我首先想起她到日本时，在“黄海舟中感怀”的两首七律。第二首道：
      闻道当年鏖战地
      至今犹带血痕流
      驰驱戎马中原梦
      破碎河山故国羞
      领海无权悲索寞
      磨刀有日快恩仇
      天风吹面冷然过
      十万云烟眼底收
    这首于光绪三十二年（1906）发表在她创办的“中国女报”第一期里的诗，不仅概括地反映了甲午中日战争（1894）、庚子八国联军战役（1900）以后的中国现实情况，也表现了当时中国人民普遍的爱国情感。秋瑾认为国必须救：“陆沉危局凭谁挽？莫向东风独倚栏？”她不“忍看图画移颜色，肯使江山付劫灰？”因而她决心：“此身拚为同胞死”，要“拚将十万头颅血，须把乾坤力挽回”。这样的情感，同样的反映了从1840年第一次鸦片战争，到1949年全国解放，一百多年来的中国爱国诗人、中国人民共通的悲愤的爱国心情。像这样的诗篇，我们不难举出千万首。可是先民们、先烈们所期待的这个伟大的愿望，直到中国共产党领导革命成功，才开始得到实现。黑暗的统治推翻了，那样悲愤哀吟的时代永不再有了。
    实现了中国人民的在长时期内不惜牺牲无数头颅以期待的伟大愿望，而且发展了先烈、先民们的愿望，达到更美好的境地——社会主义社会，我们该怎样歌颂中国共产党、拥护社会主义呢？然而，丧心病狂的右派分子，却高叫“共产党员无恶不作”“共产党该杀”“社会主义要不得！”这究竟是爱国的人民之声，还是别有用心的野心家违心之论？秋瑾诗云：“欲从大地拯危局，先向同胞说爱群”，“爱群”就是“团结”，这样卑劣的行为，是“爱群”呢，还是“害群”呢？秋瑾死而有灵，我想她是会愤怒的举起手中短剑，砍掉这些反革命脑袋的！
    在右派分子欺骗人民的谎言中，把新中国说得是到处黑暗。这又使我想起秋瑾的“中国女报发刊词”。她解释所谓“黑暗”道：
    ……世间有最凄惨、最危险之二
    字，曰“黑暗”。黑暗则无是非，
    无闻见，无一切人间世应有之思想
    行为等等。……
    因此，她要求中国女界要有方针，有领导，要革命，说“吾恐无方针之行驶，将旋于巨浪盘涡中以沈溺也”。她反对学习东西洋，“养成譒译、买办之材料”的人，反对学习东西洋，“以东瀛为终南捷径，以学堂为改良之科举”，目的在利禄的人。她认为这样培养统治阶级奴才，帝国主义走狗的办法，不是进步，而是退步。这样的领导是错误的，这样的方针也是错误的。她认为这些就是“黑暗”。
    当时的“国民日日报”，也有一篇论“黑暗现状”的短文。论者指出所谓黑暗的现实是：“因风煽焰，弱侮强拜，亿万黄金，输诚域外，为枢府之黑暗。……钻头觅缝，狗苟蝇营，磨牙吮血，虎狼食人，官场之黑暗也。……终身力作，日夕不舒，卖妻鬻子，以供官符，田野之黑暗也。……献剥骨髓，如鲠在喉，狐狸当道，关吏丰收，商旅之黑暗也”。说这些都是“人人所切齿痛心者也。”
    这样的黑暗，是一直延长到国民党统治时期，黑暗的深度，甚至有加无已。这是当时人民痛苦哀号的、最沉痛的、无可告诉的悲剧心情。然而，解放后的情况怎样呢？这些“悲哉”的情况，已经一扫而空。消灭了饥饿、贫困和失业，消灭了地主，消灭了贪污剥削。秋瑾所谓“无是非，无闻见，无一切人间世应有之思想行为等等”的黑暗现状，所慨叹的统治阶级奴才，帝国主义走狗，也同样一去不返。如果今天的中国，真像右派分子所说的那样漆黑一团，能够创造这样亘古未有，石破天惊的伟绩吗？
    我们就用这所谓五十年前的黑暗现实，来和新中国的社会生活对照对照吧！没有中国共产党的领导，能做出什么来呢？
    从秋瑾在绍兴被害后的社会反映上，从现在右派分子激起全国人民愤怒遭到迎头痛击的情况中，从无数的历史事件里，我们都可以得到一个结论，找到一种规律，那就是真理永远在人民方面。违反人民意愿的任何阴谋，纵能使少数人被蒙混于一时，最后必然要遭到广大人民的愤怒痛击，终至于灭亡。
    秋瑾就义以后，腐败的清政府，立刻就遭到全国人民的猛烈抨击。全国的报刊、作家以很大的火力，轰击腐朽卖国的统治堡垒。声势的雄伟，连顽强的统治者，也禁不住颤抖起来。就从无数哀悼诗篇的断句里，都可以看到这种情况：
    伤心七字了吟魂，万口同声骂官府。
    毕竟党魁应受罪，缘何举国大声号？
    幸得浙东公论在，轩亭市口哭同声。
    事关学界前途险，惨死轩亭通国惊。
    一样头颅，君死如何举国痛？
    而佩韦的“吊秋璇卿女士文”，更说明了秋瑾牺牲的影响：“虽然，自君之死，吾知吾国女界文明思想之发达，勃勃如圻甲，其程度之增进，不可思量矣。何者？盖惟冤君之死，痛君之死，愈益绎君之言，尊君之行，君之微言特行，将不知不觉盘踞于二万万姊妹之脑筋而莫之或去，愈演愈进，愈久愈奋，沈沈女界之大放光明，其期当不远也。”果然，当时的革命，因而扩大了影响，加速了行进，不久就把清政府推翻了。
    当时在文艺作品方面的反映，诗文辑印成专册的，至少有十数册之多。如“秋瑾”（佚名编）、“鉴湖女侠秋瑾”（佚名编）、“鉴湖女侠秋君墓表”（徐自华撰）、“秋风秋雨”（黄民编，二册）、“越恨”（湘灵子编）、“秋瑾诗词”（王芷馥编）、“六月霜”（小说，静观子撰，二册），“轩亭复活记”（小说、无生撰）、“轩亭恨”（小说、哀民撰）、“六月霜传奇”（嬴宗季女撰）、“轩亭冤传奇”（湘灵子撰）、“轩亭血传奇”（啸庐撰）、“轩亭秋杂剧”（吴梅撰）、“碧血碑杂剧”（龙禅居士撰）、“秋海棠杂剧”（悲秋散人撰）等。这些作品，都是歌颂秋瑾，反对黑暗统治者之作，把腐朽的清政府，攻击得体无完肤。一直到辛亥革命以后，犹在继续在反映。
    从这些情况看，说我们抨击反社会主义正义的右派过重，可以说完全没有立场。与五十年前“秋案”对比，只能说是大大的不够。右派分子已经要杀我们的头，要消灭我们的党，要推翻我们社会主义国家，我们还能有什么温情可言呢？而我们文艺界，通过具体作品，来反映、来战斗，以今天的实际力量论，也还不能说已经够了，我们还需要有更大的重视，更多的努力。
    秋瑾就义前，曾经写下她最后的名句：“秋风秋雨愁煞人！”秋风秋雨，这样的秋气现在是不存在了。像右派分子的这样野心阴谋，在今天的中国，不过是青空的一片“阴翳”而已，但尽管只是一片“阴翳”，如果不坚决的加以扫除，它是会带给我们以无穷灾害的！
    作者附记：病中不能写作，为纪念辛亥革命先烈秋瑾，勉成随感三则。思绪凌乱，情绪难平，不能言文，愿读者谅之。（附图片）
