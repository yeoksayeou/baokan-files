    A battle cry echoes in my ears.
    It is the voice of our worker comrades. It is the voice of our peasant comrades. It is the voice of our vigorously spirited young comrades…
    This voice, born from the realities of life, from a sincere passion for loving the Party and loving socialism, lashes and whips at the right-wingers and ambitious individuals like a steel whip, showing no mercy, magnificent like a heart-stirring poem.

    Poets, in the struggle against the right-wingers, let us enthusiastically speak out with fiery poetic verses!

    Poetry is beautiful and pleasing to the ear. It is beautiful because it is the embodiment of all beautiful things; it is pleasing to the ear because it sings of the beautiful and is forever incompatible with the ugly!

    When we see the socialist motherland, which we have used beautiful poetic sentiments to praise, being slandered, spat upon with foul-smelling saliva, and smeared beyond recognition by sinful language, poets, can we tolerate it?

    When we hear that the Party – the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party – which has led 600 million people in struggle for 36 years and finally brought happiness to the people, is being attacked, insulted, and declared to be dragged down from its leading position, poets, I think, will certainly be angered by such arrogant words and deeds.

    We are sitting on the socialist train, speeding towards a beautiful and happy tomorrow. We are laboring, we are singing. But ambitious individuals dream of pulling this train back onto the old tracks of capitalism.

    They dream of staging a Hungarian event in China.

    They dream of the scenario of a third world war. Amidst the ashes, they would emerge to pick up the pieces and individually dominate as kings among millions of skeletons.

    What an absurd and shameful Midsummer Night’s Dream.

    Poets, stand up, stand at the forefront of the struggle. Any indifference, objectivity, or lack of concern is incompatible with the title of poet.

    Our new poetry has grown and strengthened in struggle.

    In the May Fourth era, it charged against the darkness and coldness of feudal society; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it became the bugle call for national liberation; in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek’s reactionary regime, satirical poetry boosted the morale of the broad masses of the people.

    In every movement since liberation, poets have used poetry as a weapon to participate in the battle.

    In this struggle against the right-wingers, poetry should sound without even needing to be summoned, shouldn't it?

    Political enthusiasm is the soul of a poet. Seeing beautiful things being defiled, seeing ugly faces scheming and clamoring, out of love and also out of hatred, can you not jump to your feet?

    Hearing the war drums makes one think of brave generals. Hearing the sound of struggle makes me think of my poet comrades.

    Political satirical poems are increasing. Such poems are like the drumbeats of battle, inspiring people.

    The struggle is proceeding fiercely; let the drumbeats be louder!

    The struggle is proceeding fiercely; let satirical poems come in greater numbers and with greater force!

    让我们用火辣的诗句来发言吧
    臧克家
    耳边响着一片战斗的声音。
    这是工人同志们的声音。这是农民同志们的声音。这是火力旺盛的青年同志们的声音……
    这声音，从生活的实感里发出来，从爱护党，爱护社会主义的真挚热情里发出来，它钢鞭一样向右派分子、野心家们呵斥、抽打，毫不容情，壮丽有如一首激动心腑的诗。
    诗人们，在反右派斗争中，让我们踊跃地用火辣的诗句来发言吧。
    诗歌在人耳目中是美丽动听的。她美丽，因为她就是一切美丽事物的化身；她动听，因为她歌颂了美好的，永远和丑恶不相容！
    当我们看到，我们用了优美诗情去歌颂的社会主义祖国被污蔑，被吐上腥臭的唾液，被罪恶的语言涂抹得一塌糊涂，诗人们，我们能够容忍吗？
    当我们听到，领导六亿人民斗争了三十六年终于使人民得到了幸福的今天的党——伟大、光荣、正确的共产党，被攻击，被辱骂，被声言要从领导的位子上拖下来，诗人们，我想，一定会被这种狂妄的言行所激怒的。
    我们坐在社会主义的列车上，向着美丽幸福的明天奔驶。我们在劳动，我们在歌唱。野心家们却梦想把这列车，拉到资本主义的老轨道上去。
    他们梦想着在中国演出匈牙利事件。
    他们梦想着第三次世界大战的情景。在一片灰烬中，出来收拾残局，在千万架骷髅里个人称霸作王。
    这是多么荒唐可耻的一场仲夏夜之梦。
    诗人们，站起来，站到斗争的前列上来。任何冷淡，客观，不关痛痒，都和诗人的称号不相称。
    我们的新诗，是在斗争里成长壮大起来的。
    “五四”时代，它向封建社会的黑暗冷酷冲锋；抗日战争时期，它成为民族解放的号角；在反抗蒋介石反动政权的斗争中，讽刺诗鼓舞了广大人民的斗志。
    在解放后的每一次运动里，诗人们都是用诗作武器参加了战斗的。
    在这次反右派的斗争里，诗歌，应该用不到号召自己就会响起来的吧？
    政治热情是诗人的灵魂。看到美好的东西被玷污，看到丑恶的嘴脸在阴谋叫嚣，由于爱，也由于憎，你能不一跃而起？
    闻鼙鼓而思猛将。听到斗争的声音我想起了诗人同志们。
    政治讽刺诗多起来了。这样的诗，像战斗的鼓点，令人振奋。
    斗争在猛烈的进行，鼓点敲得再响些吧。
    斗争在猛烈的进行，讽刺诗来得更多些，更有力些吧！
