At this meeting, we studied Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of several vice premiers, as well as the work reports of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Supreme Procuratorate and the Supreme Court. I fully agree with these reports, and I firmly believe that if we earnestly follow Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people and conscientiously study and implement the work requirements put forward in these reports, we will further enhance the unity of all ethnic groups, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and continuously achieve victories in socialist construction.

    The Face of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Has Undergone Fundamental Changes

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, in the past short decade, the Inner Mongolia ethnic group has achieved unified regional autonomy throughout Inner Mongolia, thoroughly completed democratic reform, developed the economic and cultural construction of the autonomous region, and the material and cultural life of all ethnic groups has been significantly improved and enhanced. For example, comparing the situation ten years before and after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, grain production has increased by 1.5 times, the number of livestock has increased by more than 2 times. In 1946, each herdsman had an average of 13 livestock, now it has increased to 37. In 1945, there were only 47 old and dilapidated small factories in the entire region, while in 1956, there were 823 factories of various types, including more than 200 larger modern state-owned factories. The total industrial output value has increased by 27 times, the forestry industry has produced 8.98 million cubic meters of timber in the past ten years, supplying it to all parts of the country, the number of various types of schools has increased by 4.7 times, the number of students has increased by 5.5 times, of which the number of Mongolian primary school students has increased by more than 10 times, and the number of secondary school students has increased by 20 times. The number of health and medical institutions has increased by 37 times, the Mongolian population has increased by 200,000, and the people's purchasing power has increased by 4 times compared with 1950. Last year, we also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation. Farmers who have joined agricultural cooperatives account for 96% of the total number of farm households, of which 86% of farm households have joined advanced cooperatives. 83% of herdsmen have joined various types of mutual aid organizations for livestock production, of which 24% of herding households have joined livestock production cooperatives. Individual handicraftsmen have all been organized into various types of handicraft production cooperatives, and capitalist industry and commerce have all been transformed into joint state-private ownership. In short, the socialist system has been basically established. On the basis of the victory of socialist transformation, socialist construction has seen an unprecedented and tremendous upsurge. Industrial and agricultural production, basic construction, transportation, and commerce have all overfulfilled the 1956 plan and reached or exceeded the 1957 plan level. Now the face of the autonomous region has undergone fundamental changes.

    The Construction Achievements of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Cannot Be Denied

Building socialism is the common goal of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Only socialism can make the country prosperous and strong and the people happy. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like other parts of the country, achieved the basic victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce last year, and socialist construction has made great progress. This is precisely the result of the successful implementation of the Party's ethnic policies and other policies over the past few years, and it is also proof that the Mongolian people and the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are actively yearning for socialism. All these facts show that the minority ethnic groups in China can only be liberated, achieve ethnic equality and unity, and become masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the economic and cultural development of the ethnic groups can be fully developed.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are all jubilant for the great achievements they have achieved in socialist transformation and socialist construction, but some ulterior motives Rightists, like the Rightists in other parts of the country, under the guise of "helping the Party rectify its work style," launched a frenzied attack on the socialist cause that the Party, the people, and our people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly support. In order to achieve their sinister goal of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, the Rightists denied the achievements of the construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, saying that the construction achievements of Inner Mongolia in the past ten years are "bullshit, saying that achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are secondary, this kind of view is stereotyped"; some Rightists exaggerated some of our shortcomings in ethnic work and spread nationalism in an attempt to undermine the close unity of the people of all ethnic groups. All this clearly shows that the Rightists—whether they are from Beijing, Shanghai, or Inner Mongolia—their words are the same, and their purpose is to oppose the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the criminal activities of the Rightists in opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, and we must carry the struggle against the Rightists through to the end.

    Grain Production Increased and Animal Husbandry Developed Greatly in the First Year of Cooperation

Next, I would like to talk about the agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation and agricultural and animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

In 1956, the first year of cooperation in our region, our grain production increased by 1.3 million tons, not only completing the annual plan but also overfulfilling the 1957 target set by the first five-year plan by more than 5%. The unit area yield of grain exceeded the average yield of the highest year in history. Calculated by the rural population, each person averaged 1,340 jin of grain. 80% of the members of the agricultural production cooperatives increased their income, about 10% of the members' income was equivalent to the previous year's level, and only about 10% of the members reduced their income due to various natural disasters and other reasons, but their difficulties in life were also properly resolved with the help of the agricultural cooperatives.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an ethnic region. In the process of cooperation, we have formed a large number of agricultural production cooperatives that are solely or jointly organized by Mongolians and other ethnic groups. These types of cooperatives account for about 40% of the total number of cooperatives in the region. In the ethnic joint cooperatives, we not only conscientiously implemented the general principles of cooperation but also fully took care of the ethnic characteristics, that is, took care of the different production and living habits and requirements of the ethnic groups, so that the ethnic groups can help each other, learn from each other, and develop together in the process of common labor and production, so that the vast majority of members increase their income and their lives are improved. Practice has proved that running ethnic joint cooperatives well enables the ethnic groups to cooperate economically, help each other, and develop together, thereby promoting closer political unity among the ethnic groups.

In 1956, the animal husbandry production in our region had a great development. The total number of livestock reached 24.4 million, an increase of 1.61 million over 1955. The socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas has also made great progress. Livestock production cooperatives have shown great superiority in production. According to the statistics of 346 cooperatives last year, 93% of them increased production and 80% to 90% of the members increased their income.

Our socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas is based on the characteristics of animal husbandry and the conditions of pastoral society, the consciousness and voluntariness of herdsmen, and resolutely implemented the policy of "relying on working herdsmen, uniting all forces that can be united (including livestock owners), and gradually carrying out socialist transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production." The transformation of livestock owners is also based on the above-mentioned guiding principles and policies, and various forms are adopted for peaceful transformation. Practice has proved that the Party's policy on the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of herdsmen.

    Some Problems in the Process of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Cooperation

The achievements of the development of agricultural and animal husbandry cooperation and agricultural and animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are great and should be affirmed. Of course, there are shortcomings and errors in our work. For example, in the process of agricultural cooperation, we did not proceed from the characteristics of the Inner Mongolia region in handling the issue of livestock entering the cooperatives in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Therefore, we neglected that it is also necessary to resolutely implement the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and carrying out transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production. As a result, the error of forcing members to evaluate all livestock and return them to the cooperatives occurred in some areas, resulting in a phenomenon that some people sold and slaughtered livestock in large quantities and livestock were seriously damaged due to poor care.

Secondly, in the western Inner Mongolia region, in order to adjust ethnic relations and unite Mongolian and Han farmers to jointly eliminate the landlord class during the land reform, it was necessary to allocate one or two more portions of land to Mongolians when distributing land. However, when turning to advanced cooperation, different guiding principles and specific measures were not adopted according to the local specific situation, and a unified method of canceling land remuneration was implemented, which resulted in a reduction in income for some Mongolians. At the same time, in the management policy of cooperation, the policy of diversified management was not well implemented. The prominent problem is that agriculture was emphasized and sideline occupations were neglected. As a result, sideline income generally decreased in various places last year.

The socialist transformation of pastoral areas has not yet had major deviations in guiding principles and policies, but some deviations and errors have also occurred in individual areas, which have affected production to a certain extent. At the same time, the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is a new topic, and there are still many specific issues that need to be studied and resolved well. The construction problems in pastoral areas, such as settlement, well drilling, the establishment of feed bases, and livestock veterinary stations, cannot keep up with the needs of the development of pastoral areas. Some problems such as livestock prices and material supply in pastoral areas still need to be carefully studied and resolved.

The reason why the above problems occurred in our work, in addition to the lack of experience and methods of the cadres, is mainly related to the bureaucratic and subjective style of leadership. Some deviations and errors were checked and corrected after they were discovered, and some are planned to be further checked and improved in conjunction with the current Party rectification movement.

    Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry This Year and Give Full Play to the Superiority of Cooperation

The task of economic construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1957 is very arduous, and striving for a bumper harvest of agriculture and animal husbandry is the decisive link in striving for a comprehensive upsurge in the economy of the autonomous region. This year's grain production is required to increase by 3.4% over last year's planned production, soybeans by 11.3% over last year, sugar beets by 14.9%, and livestock is required to increase by 7.8% net. In order to strive to achieve a bumper harvest of agriculture and animal husbandry this year, the most important issue is to continue to give play to the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, give full play to the superiority of cooperation, try every means to overcome difficulties, and absorb last year's experience and lessons to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. Since this spring, we have conducted a general publicity and education on the rectification of the society and the superiority of cooperation by checking and summarizing production experience, handling the problems of the transfer of cooperatives to advanced societies last year and the distribution after the autumn, which has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members and society cadres for production and work. According to the characteristics of Inner Mongolia having a vast agricultural area and pastoral area, and many farmers in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas having a history and habit of managing livestock, as well as the superior conditions for developing agricultural and animal husbandry production on a large scale, the policy for the development of production in rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and diversified management, that is, agricultural areas vigorously develop agriculture while developing animal husbandry and various sideline occupations, and pastoral areas vigorously develop animal husbandry while gradually establishing feed bases and developing various sideline occupations, and specifically stipulate the implementation of the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and diversified management in agricultural areas; In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the policy of overall planning, focusing on animal husbandry, taking care of agriculture, protecting pastures, prohibiting wasteland reclamation, and planning to develop agricultural and animal husbandry economy is implemented. Cooperatives are required to not only develop public animal husbandry but also develop the private animal husbandry of members, so that the production of cooperatives can truly achieve the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and diversified management, in order to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for managing animal husbandry. Specific handling methods have been stipulated for the deviations that occurred in some places when transferring livestock to the cooperatives at a forced price during the transfer to advanced societies last year, and the issue of the cancellation of land remuneration when transferring to advanced societies in western Inner Mongolia, which reduced the income of some Mongolians, and have been basically corrected.

In order to implement the policy of running the society diligently and frugally and running the society democratically, according to the three regulations issued by the Central Committee, such as announcing the financial expenditures of the cooperatives on time, discussing the issues decided by the societies and teams with the masses, and participating in production by the society cadres, the cooperatives in various places in our region have generally implemented them, which has been supported by the broad masses of members and greatly improved the relationship between the society cadres and the masses of members. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of agriculture, various production increase measures have been promoted in accordance with local conditions, overcoming the subjective and unrealistic errors and deviations in this regard, continuing to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy projects, actively mobilizing farmers to excavate fertilizer sources, expand the fertilizer application area, strengthen the supply of materials for spring plowing production, and transfer a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to strengthen the leadership of the grassroots level. Although there are many difficulties in agricultural production in our region this spring, and drought has occurred in some areas, the task of spring plowing and sowing has been basically completed through the efforts of leaders at all levels and the cadres and members of the broad masses of cooperatives. The seedlings in most areas are growing well. If there are no major disasters in the future, we are confident of striving for a bumper harvest of agriculture.

Serious snowstorms occurred in pastoral areas last winter and this spring. Thanks to the fact that Party and government departments at all levels sent a large number of cadres to the pastoral areas to mobilize the broad masses of herdsmen to actively carry out disaster resistance and livestock protection. The role of livestock cooperatives and mutual aid groups was given full play in the work of disaster resistance and livestock protection. A large number of feeds were also transferred from agricultural areas and a part of the pastures were regulated to support the pastoral areas. Although the snowstorms were very large and lasted for a long time, the loss of livestock was greatly reduced compared with the past under the same circumstances.

In order to strive for an increase in animal husbandry production this year, we are comprehensively carrying out the movement to increase and protect livestock, vigorously rectifying and consolidating the existing livestock production cooperatives, improving management and improving production technology, continuing to establish feed bases, strengthening water conservancy construction in pastoral areas and the prevention and control of livestock diseases, and striving to increase the number of livestock while paying attention to improving the quality of livestock.

The current central task of leadership in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is: In order to strive for a bumper harvest of agriculture, we will fully carry out the movement to increase production and save resources. According to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we have made comprehensive arrangements, and the movement to increase production and save resources has been generally carried out in the whole region. Now we are following the above instructions and the instruction issued by the State Council on June 10 to earnestly strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, and combining the rectification movement, we are taking various effective measures to conduct a general inspection, and truly combining the rectification movement with the movement to increase production and save resources, improving while rectifying, solving problems immediately, using the actual results of increasing production and saving resources to inspect the achievements of the rectification movement, and further deepening and persevering the movement to increase production and save resources to strive for a bumper harvest of agriculture and animal husbandry, and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the task of the first five-year plan for national economic development.

    从内蒙古的情况看党的民族政策的胜利
    奎璧的发言
    这次会议上我们学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告和几位副总理的报告以及人大常委和最高检察院、最高法院的工作报告，对这些报告我完全同意，并且深信我们今后只要认真遵循毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，切实研究执行几个报告中提出的工作要求，必然会更加增强各民族人民的团结，巩固人民民主专政，不断地取得社会主义建设的胜利。
    内蒙古自治区的面貌发生了根本性的变化
    内蒙古民族在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在过去短短的十年，实现了全内蒙古统一的区域自治，彻底完成了民主改革，发展了自治区的经济文化建设事业，各族人民的物质文化生活得到显著的改善和提高，如以内蒙古自治区成立十年前后的情况相比较，粮食的产量增加了一点五倍，牲畜头数增加二倍多，一九四六年每个牧民平均有十三头牲畜，现在增加到三十七头，一九四五年全区只有四十七座陈旧破烂的小工厂，而一九五六年全区已有八百二十三座各种类型的工厂，其中较大的现代化的国营工厂即有二百多个，工业总产值增加二十七倍，森林工业十年来生产了八百九十八万立方米木材，供应全国各地，各类学校增加四点七倍，学生增加五点五倍，其中蒙古族小学校学生增加十倍多，中等学校学生增加了二十倍，卫生医疗机构增加三十七倍，蒙古族人口增加二十万，人民购买力比一九五○年增加了四倍。去年又取得了社会主义改造的决定性的胜利，加入农业合作社的农民已占总农户的百分之九十六，其中参加高级社的农户占百分之八十六，有百分之八十三的牧民加入了各种类型的牧业生产互助组织，其中参加牧业生产合作社的牧户已占总牧户的百分之二十四，个体手工业者，已全部组织到各种类型的手工业生产合作社，资本主义工商业亦已全部改造为公私合营。总之，社会主义制度已基本建立起来，在社会主义改造胜利的基础上，社会主义建设出现了空前的巨大高涨，工农业生产、基本建设、交通运输、商业都超额完成了一九五六年的计划，并达到或超过一九五七年的计划水平，现在自治区的面貌，已发生了根本性的变化。
    内蒙古自治区的建设成就是否定不了的
    建设社会主义是我国各民族人民共同奋斗的目标。唯有社会主义才能使国家繁荣富强和人民幸福。内蒙古自治区在去年，与全国各地一样，取得了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的基本胜利，社会主义建设有了巨大的发展，这正是由于过去几年来党的民族政策和其他各项政策胜利实施的结果，同时也是蒙古族人民及自治区各族人民积极向往社会主义的证明。这一切事实说明，中国的少数民族只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能得到解放，才能实现民族平等团结，当家作主，民族的经济文化才能得到充分的发展。
    内蒙古自治区各族人民都为自己在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中所获得的伟大成绩而欢欣鼓舞，但是一些别有用心的右派分子，也同全国其他地区的右派分子一样，假借“帮助党整风”向党、向人民、向我们各族人民所衷心拥护的社会主义事业，展开了猖狂的进攻。右派分子为了达到他们反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶目的，他们否认内蒙古自治区建设的成就，说什么内蒙古十年的建设成就是“扯淡的，说成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，这样看法是八股”；有的右派分子把我们在民族工作上的某些缺点加以扩大化，散布民族主义，企图破坏各民族人民的亲密团结。这一切很明显的看得出右派分子——不论他们是北京、上海的，还是内蒙古地区的，他们的话，都是一样的，他们的目的，都是为了反对共产党、反对社会主义、反对全国各民族人民的。因此，我们要坚决反对右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动，要把反对右派分子的斗争坚持进行到底。
    实现了合作化的第一年粮食增产畜牧业大发展
    下面我想说一说内蒙古自治区农牧业合作化和农牧业生产情况。
    一九五六年，是我区实现了合作化的第一年，我们的粮食产量即增加了一百三十万吨，不仅完成了年度计划，而且还超额完成了第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年指标百分之五多，粮食的单位面积产量超过了历史上最高年的平均产量，按农村人口计算，每一人平均粮食为一千三百四十斤。农业生产合作社百分之八十的社员增加了收入，百分之十左右的社员收入相当于上年的水平，只有百分之十左右的社员，因各种自然灾害及其他原因，减少了收入，但他们生活上的困难，在农业社的帮助下，也都得到了适当解决。
    内蒙古自治区是民族地区，我们在合作化的过程中，组成了大批的蒙古族及其他各民族单一的或联合组织的农业生产合作社，这类社大约占全区合作社的百分之四十左右，我们在各民族联社里，不仅认真贯彻执行了合作化的一般原则，而且充分照顾了民族特点，即照顾各民族不同的生产和生活的习惯、要求，使各民族在共同劳动生产的过程中，互相帮助，互相学习，共同发展，使绝大多数社员增加了收入，生活有所改善。实践证明办好民族联合社，它使各民族由于经济上的合作，互相帮助，共同发展，从而促使各民族间政治上更加亲密团结。
    一九五六年，我区畜牧生产有了巨大的发展，牲畜总头数达到二千四百四十万头，比一九五五年增加一百六十一万头。牧区畜牧业的社会主义改造也获得了很大进展，牧业生产合作社在生产上表现了极大的优越性，根据去年三百四十六个社的统计，其中百分之九十三的社增加了生产，百分之八十至九十的社员增加了收入。
    我们对牧区畜牧业的社会主义改造，是根据畜牧业的特点与牧区社会的条件、牧民的觉悟和自愿，坚决贯彻执行了“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量
  （包括牧主在内），在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步进行社会主义改造”的方针，对于牧主的改造也是根据上述这个方针政策，采取了多种多样的形式，进行和平改造。实践证明：党对畜牧业的社会主义改造的方针，是为广大牧民群众所热诚拥护的。
    农牧业合作化过程中的一些问题
    内蒙古自治区农牧业合作化和农牧业生产的发展成绩是巨大的，应该加以肯定。当然，在我们的工作中，并不是没有缺点和错误。如我们在农业合作化的过程中，对于处理农业区和半农半牧区牲畜入社问题，没有从内蒙古地区的特点出发，因而忽视了农业社会主义改造中也必须坚决贯彻执行保护发展畜牧业，并在稳定发展生产的基础上，进行改造的方针，因而在部分地区发生了强迫社员把牲畜一律作价归社的错误，致一度发生一些群众大批出卖、宰杀牲畜和牲畜因照料的不好而严重损失的现象。
    其次，对于内蒙古西部地区在土改时为了调整民族关系，团结蒙、汉农民共同消灭地主阶级，在分配土地时多分给蒙民一份到两份土地，这一措施是必要的。但在转为高级合作化时，没有根据当地具体情况出发，采取不同的方针政策和具体措施，实行了一律取消土地报酬的办法，因而造成了一部分蒙民减少收入。同时，在合作化的经营的方针上，没有很好的贯彻执行多种经营的方针，突出的问题是重视了农业，忽视了副业，因而去年各地副业收入一般都有减少。
    牧区的社会主义改造，还没有发生较大的方针政策性的偏差，但个别地区也发生过一些偏差和错误，在一定程度上影响了生产，同时牧业的社会主义改造是一个新的课题，还有许多具体问题需要很好研究解决。牧区建设问题，如定居、打井、建立饲料基地、畜牧兽医站等工作，赶不上牧区发展的需要，牧区的牲畜价格，物资供应等一些问题，还须认真研究解决。
    我们工作中所以发生以上问题，除了干部缺乏经验和办法以外，主要的是与领导作风存在着官僚主义、主观主义有关的。有些偏差错误发现后即作了检查纠正，有的结合这次全党整风拟进一步检查改进。
    争取今年农牧业大丰收  充分发挥合作化优越性
    一九五七年内蒙古自治区经济建设任务是十分艰巨的，而争取农牧业的大丰收是争取自治区经济全面高涨的决定性的环节。今年的粮食产量要求比去年的计划产量增长百分之三点四，大豆比去年增长百分之十一点三，甜菜增长百分之十四点九，牲畜要求净增百分之七点八。为了争取实现今年农牧业大丰收，最主要的问题，是继续发挥广大群众的社会主义积极性，充分发挥合作化的优越性，想尽一切办法，克服困难，并吸收去年的经验教训，加强对农业生产的领导。我们从今年春季起，即通过检查总结生产经验，处理合作社去年转高级社和秋后分配中的问题，普遍进行了一次整社和合作化优越性的宣传教育，进一步鼓舞了广大社员和社干部生产和工作的积极性。根据内蒙古有广大农业区、畜牧区，而农业区和半农半牧区很多农民有经营牧畜的历史和习惯的特点以及大量发展农牧业生产的优越条件，内蒙古自治区农村牧区发展生产的方针是农牧结合，多种经营，即农业区大力发展农业的同时，发展畜牧业和各种副业，牧业区大力发展畜牧业的同时，要逐步地建立饲料基地，发展各种副业，并具体规定在农业区实行农牧结合，多种经营的方针；在半农半牧地区实行全面规划以牧为主，照顾农业，保护牧场，禁止开荒，有计划发展农牧业经济的方针。要求合作社既要发展公有的畜牧业，又要发展社员的私有畜牧业，使合作社的生产真正作到农牧结合，多种经营，以鼓励农民经营畜牧业的积极性。对去年转高级社时一些地方所发生的对牲畜强迫作价入社的偏差，和内蒙古西部地区转高级社时，取消了土地报酬，使一部分蒙民减少收入问题，都规定了具体处理办法，基本作了纠正。
    为了贯彻执行勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，根据中央指示的按时公布合作社财政开支、社队决定问题要和群众商量、社干参加生产等三项规定，我区各地合作社已较普遍地执行起来，得到了广大社员的拥护，大大的改进了社干和社员群众的关系。为了争取农业大丰收，因地制宜地推行了各项增产措施，克服在这方面主观主义脱离实际的错误偏差，继续大力兴修小型水利，积极发动农民挖掘肥源，扩大施肥面积，加强了春耕生产的物资供应，抽调大批干部派到基层，加强了基层的领导。我区今春农业生产中虽有不少困难，部分地区发生干旱，经过各级领导与广大合作社干部与社员的努力，已基本完成了春耕播种任务，大部地区苗出的较好，今后如无特大灾害，争取农业丰收我们是有信心的。
    牧区去冬今春曾发生了严重风雪灾害，由于各级党政派出了大批干部深入牧区，发动广大牧民积极进行抗灾保畜。在抗灾保畜工作中充分发挥了牧业合作社和互助组的作用，并从农业区调运了大批饲料和调剂了一部分牧场，支援了牧区，虽然风雪灾害很大，延续时间长，但牲畜的损失较之过去同样情况下大为减少。
    我们为了力争今年畜牧业的增产，正全面地开展增畜保畜运动，大力整顿巩固现有的牧业生产合作社，改善经营管理，改进生产技术，继续建立饲料基地，加强牧区水利建设和牲畜疫病的防治工作，在努力增加牲畜数量的同时并注重提高牲畜的质量。
    内蒙古自治区，当前领导的中心任务是：为了争取农收业大丰收，全力开展增产节约运动。我们根据中共中央和国务院的指示，已经作了全面的布置，增产节约运动已经在全区普遍的开展起来，现在我们正按照上述指示和国务院六月十日发出的切实加强农业生产领导的指示，结合整风运动，采取各种有效措施，进行普遍检查，真正把整风运动同增产节约运动紧密结合起来，边整边改进，有问题马上解决，以增产节约的实际效果来检查整风运动的成就，把增产节约运动进一步深入持久地开展起来，争取农牧业大丰收，为争取全面完成和超额完成第一个五年国民经济计划任务而奋斗。
