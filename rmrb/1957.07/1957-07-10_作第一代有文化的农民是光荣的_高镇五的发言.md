I fully endorse the work reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, President Dong of the Supreme People's Court, and Procurator-General Zhang of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and I will resolutely implement them in my future work. Now I will talk about how Henan Province will arrange for middle and primary school graduates to participate in production this year and vigorously implement the mass education policy.

It's a Good Phenomenon, Not a Bad One

With the development of national economic construction and the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of people, the number of children of working people entering schools in Henan Province, like other provinces across the country, has been increasing in recent years. Currently, there are nearly 4.9 million primary school students (3.5 times that of 1949) and more than 310,000 middle school students (7.6 times that of 1949). Among the middle and primary school graduates over the years, more than 800,000 have participated in production. The achievements are great. However, the development of school education still cannot meet the people's growing cultural needs. This contradiction is manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, among the 530,000 middle and primary school graduates this year, about 400,000 will not be able to continue their studies; on the other hand, there are currently 1.6 million school-age children in the province (34% of school-age children) who cannot attend school. How to properly arrange for middle and primary school graduates to participate in production and vigorously implement the mass education policy is a more prominent issue in resolving the current internal contradictions among the people in our province. We believe that to correctly resolve this contradiction, we must first correctly analyze this contradiction, so that our understanding can accurately reflect the objective reality, and then take appropriate measures based on actual possibilities to properly handle it, so that our work can move forward further. Our understanding of this contradiction should first affirm that the development speed of middle and primary school education in our province has been very fast in the past. The fact that more middle and primary school graduates cannot all continue their studies this year is the result of the development of middle and primary school education in recent years, not an error in our work, and even less should it negate the great achievements of the development of education. Judging from the figures listed in Vice Premier Li's report on the 1956 national final accounts and the 1957 national budget, the state has already done its best to meet the people's growing cultural needs. If we demand that the state provide more funds to completely cover the enrollment of all school-age children and the further education of middle and primary school graduates, it not only violates the policy of mobilizing and organizing middle and primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production, but is also detrimental to national industrialization. Secondly, it should also be affirmed that the fact that more middle and primary school graduates cannot continue their studies this year, compared with the past situation where most or all of them continued their studies, should be said to be a good phenomenon, not a bad one. This is because more middle and primary school graduates have been arranged to participate in production this year, especially agricultural production, which has created extremely favorable conditions for the development of production. At the same time, due to the increase in high school graduates and the appropriate reduction in the number of students enrolled in universities this year, a relatively solid foundation has been laid for improving the quality of education in universities in the future. Therefore, properly arranging for middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to participate in production and vigorously implementing the mass education policy are in line with the current demands of the masses and the needs of national construction. Of course, there are many difficulties in achieving the above policies. As long as we can conduct necessary political education for the masses based on the actual situation and take appropriate measures, the difficulties can be overcome.

The Socialist Countryside is Calling

Now, let's first talk about properly arranging for middle and primary school graduates to participate in production.

The fact that not all middle and primary school graduates can continue their studies is not only the case today, but will remain so for a relatively long period in the future. This is a normal phenomenon in the development of general education. In the future, before junior high school becomes universal education, the proportion of those who cannot continue their studies should be: larger for primary school, smaller for junior high school, and even smaller for senior high school, forming a pyramid-like shape. The current situation in our province is in line with this objective law of educational development. Properly arranging for middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to participate in production is extremely beneficial to promoting the rapid development of the national economy. At present, the social sources of middle and primary school students in our province are mostly peasant children from rural areas, accounting for more than 95% of the total number of students. If peasant children, once they study, all permanently leave agricultural production, it will be very detrimental to promoting the development of agricultural production. According to a survey of the Fogang and Shilipu agricultural cooperatives in the Zhengzhou suburbs, with a total population of 2,553 people, there are 545 full and semi-laborers, including 320 young people, accounting for more than 58.7% of the total number of laborers; among the young people, 151 are studying in middle and primary schools (including current graduates), accounting for more than 47.1% of the total number of young people; there are 62 current middle and primary school graduates, accounting for 19.4% of the total number of young people. If these young students do not return to participate in agricultural production after graduation, the first to be affected is that these two cooperatives will inevitably be affected in their production due to insufficient labor force. The labor burden of these two cooperatives averages about 12 to 15 mu per laborer, the management is very rough, and last year the average yield per mu was only 110 jin for wheat and 250 jin for corn. It is obvious that the potential of the land has not been fully utilized. Secondly, judging from the current cultural level of the cooperative cadres in the two cooperatives, among the 15 accountants, only one is a junior high school dropout, four have the equivalent of primary school education, and the remaining ten are peasants who are barely literate and can barely do abacus calculations; among the three technicians, two only have primary school education, and the other is illiterate; there are 280 people in the people's schools, and the teachers who regularly give lectures are only graduates of senior primary schools. If they are not arranged to participate in production in the countryside, the improvement of the management level and technical level of the two cooperatives will be seriously affected.

Examples of Young Students in Agricultural Production

In addition, based on the current situation of middle and primary school graduates who have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, they have not only become the glorious first generation of cultured farmers, but have also played a significant and important role in agricultural production. For example, among the 385 graduates of Lianchi Primary School in Shenqiu in 1955 and 1956, 228 participated in agricultural production (59.2% of the total number of graduates). Among them, 138 served as cooperative cadres, accounting for 60.5% (1 cooperative director, 8 production team leaders, 45 accountants, 36 work recorders, 12 technicians, 31 teachers, and 5 youth league cadres); in politics, 46 joined the Communist Youth League and 2 joined the Communist Party. After Zhang Guangyou, a graduate of Dakou Township Middle School in Yanshi County, became the production team leader, because he was able to pay attention to promptly solving the difficulties in mutual aid production, unite the team members, and drive the various production teams, he promoted the work in all aspects of this village. There are many similar model cases in various counties, too numerous to mention. Regarding the issue of urban middle and primary school graduates participating in production, according to statistics from Zhengzhou City, in addition to preparing to arrange the 6,835 (3,973 in the urban area) middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies this year to participate in production in production organizations in handicrafts and service industries, and preparing to adopt methods such as self-study groups, cooperative schools, and private schools to enable them to continue their studies, the city also plans to vigorously mobilize and organize urban youth to go to the countryside to participate in production. According to preliminary exploration, in addition to ideological obstacles, there are still many concrete difficulties, such as accommodation, meals, production shares, and agricultural tools. However, today the countryside has already achieved advanced cooperativization, and the members of the cooperative are different from the individual farmers who were bound to a few acres of land in the past. This has a certain attraction for young students, and there are also a large number of cadres taking the lead in participating in labor production. We believe that as long as our work is arduous, in-depth, and specifically helpful, this policy will definitely be implemented.

Give Play to the Enthusiasm of the Masses in Running Schools

Secondly, let's talk about how to implement the mass education policy.

Regarding mobilizing the masses to run schools, the masses in our province have a good tradition of running schools in the past. Before 1952, most of the primary schools and some of the middle schools in our province were developed by local people in various forms. Over the years, because our ideological understanding of the policy of popularizing education has not been clear enough, and we have stipulated some requirements and restrictions that are not conducive to unfettered development, we have overemphasized standardization, especially after the basic completion of agricultural cooperativization, we have mistakenly taken over most of the people-run primary schools by the state, which has affected the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools to a certain extent. At present, there are 3 middle schools run by factories, mines, enterprises, and organizations in the province, with 2,907 students; 33 primary schools, with 1,321 students; 1,443 primary schools run jointly by the masses, with 125,961 students; 1 junior high school class, with 59 students. The above figures account for 2.6% of the total number of students in the province. In addition, there are 6 private primary schools with 755 students. After the Provincial People's Committee announced the interim measures for mass education this year, in the past two months, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng cities alone have established and are in the process of establishing a total of 57 cooperative middle school classes run by organizations, groups, and individuals, which can absorb 2,800 students; they can solve the problems of school buildings, funding, and teachers themselves. These facts show that, in addition to the educational undertakings that the state can run, relying on social and mass forces and adopting various forms to run schools to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools can appropriately meet the learning requirements of school-age children and middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies and cannot participate in production for the time being, which should be vigorously promoted. In short, according to our province's experience, as long as the leadership takes appropriate measures and gives full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, it will quickly develop.

The Idea of Underestimating Labor Should Be Criticized

Fellow representatives: Our understanding of this policy has been constantly improved through practice. Our work is also constantly advancing with the improvement of our understanding. Our main task at present is to continue to strengthen political and ideological education, criticize the erroneous ideas of "scholarship leads to officialdom" and "only studying is noble" that underestimate physical labor among young students, parents, and social opinions, and improve their socialist consciousness. At the same time, we must also, under the unified leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, closely cooperate in all aspects, and thoroughly understand the employment needs of all parties to prepare for the implementation of the policy of "overall consideration and appropriate arrangement". As for the past tendencies in teaching work to not consistently implement the policy of labor education and to be detached from politics and reality to a certain extent, as well as overemphasizing standardization in the work of popularizing education, we are prepared to seriously examine and overcome these erroneous views in this rectification movement.

    作第一代有文化的农民是光荣的
    高镇五的发言
    我完全拥护周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、全国人民代表大会常务委员会彭副委员长、最高人民法院董院长和最高人民检察院张检察长的工作报告，并且要在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我来谈谈河南省今年如何安排中、小学毕业生参加生产和大力贯彻执行群众办学的方针问题。
    是好现象而不是坏现象
    随着国家经济建设的发展和广大人民生活水平的提高，几年来，我们河南省和全国各省一样，劳动人民子弟入学人数已日益增多，目前小学生人数近四百九十万人（为一九四九年的三倍半），中学生人数三十一万多人（为一九四九年的七点六倍）。在历年的中、小学毕业生中，参加生产的人数已有八十余万。成绩是很大的。但目前学校教育的发展仍然不能满足人民日益增长的文化要求。这一矛盾，表现在两个方面：一方面表现在今年毕业的中、小学生总数五十三万人中，将有四十万左右不能继续升学；另一方面表现在全省目前尚有适龄儿童一百六十万人（占适龄儿童的百分之三十四）不能入学。今后如何妥善安排中、小学毕业生参加生产和大力贯彻执行群众办学的方针，是解决我省当前人民内部矛盾的一个较为突出的问题。我们认为要正确的解决这个矛盾，首先要正确的分析这个矛盾，使我们的认识能够正确的反映客观实际，然后根据实际可能，采取适当的措施，妥善处理，才能使我们的工作更加前进一步。我们对于这一矛盾的认识，首先应该肯定：我省已往的中、小学教育的发展速度是很快的，今年有较多的中、小学毕业生不能全部升学，是几年来中、小学校教育发展的结果，不是工作中的错误，更不能因此否认教育事业发展的伟大成就。我们从李副总理关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告中所列数字来看，国家已经尽了最大力量来满足人民日益增长的文化要求，如果要求国家拿出更多经费把全部适龄儿童的入学问题和中、小学毕业生升学问题完全包起来，不仅违反了动员组织中、小学毕业生参加农业生产的方针，对国家工业化也是不利的。其次，还应该肯定今年有较多的中、小学毕业生不能升学，与过去大部分升学和全部升学的情况相比，应该说是一个好的现象，而不是一个坏的现象，这是由于今年较多的安排中、小学毕业生参加了生产，特别是农业生产，为发展生产创造了极为有利的条件。同时还由于高中毕业生的增多和大专学校今年的招生数适当的收缩，这就为今后提高大专学校的教育质量打下了比较稳固的基础，因此，妥善安排不能升学的中、小学毕业生参加生产和大力贯彻执行群众办学的方针，是适合当前的群众要求和国家建设需要的。当然实现上述方针，是存在着许多困难的，只要能够根据实际情况，对群众进行必要的政治教育和采取适当的措施，困难是可以克服的。
    社会主义农村在召唤
    现在首先谈谈妥善安排中、小学毕业生参加生产问题。
    中、小学毕业生不能全部升学不仅今天如此，今后在一个较长的时期内仍然如此，这是普通教育发展的正常现象，今后在初中还未成为普及教育以前，不能升学的比例，应该是：小学较大，初中较小，高中更小，形成像宝塔式的形状。目前我省的实际情况，是符合于教育事业发展的这个客观规律的。妥善安排不能升学的中、小学毕业生参加生产，对促进国民经济的迅速发展是极为有利的。目前我省的中、小学生的社会来源，绝大多数是从农村来的农民子弟，他们占学生总数的百分之九十五以上，如果农民子弟一经读书，就全部永久的脱离农业生产，对促进农业生产的发展，是很不利的。从郑州郊区佛岗、十里铺两个农业社的调查，共有人口二千五百五十三人，内有五百四十五个全劳动力和半劳动力，其中青年三百二十人，占劳动力总人数的百分之五十八点七强；在青年中，正在中、小学读书的（应届毕业生在内）一百五十一人，占青年总人数的百分之四十七点一强；应届毕业的中、小学生六十二人，占青年总数的百分之十九点四。如果这些青年学生毕业后都不回去参加农业生产，首先受到影响的是这两个社必然因劳动力不足而影响生产，这两个社在劳动负担上每个劳动力平均负担约为十二亩到十五亩，经营很粗糙，去年每亩平均产量小麦只一百一十斤，玉米二百五十斤，很显然土地的潜力还远远没有得到充分的发挥；其次就两个社的社干现有文化水平来看，两个社现有的十五个会计中，仅有一个是初中肄业学生，四个相当小学文化水平，其余十人都是识字不多勉强会打珠算的农民；在现有三个技术员中，有两个仅具有初小文化程度，另一个是文盲；民校二百八十人，经常讲课的教员仅是高小毕业生；如果不安排他们到农村参加生产，两社的社务管理水平和技术水平的提高是要受到严重影响的。青年学生在农业生产中的范例
    另就已经回乡参加农业生产的中、小学毕业生的目前情况来考察，他们不仅已经成为光荣的第一代有文化的农民，而且在农业生产上已经起到明显的重要作用。如沈丘莲池小学一九五五和一九五六两年毕业生三百八十五人中，有二百二十八人参加了农业生产（占毕业总人数的百分之五十九点二），他们在社里担任社干的有一百三十八人，占百分之六十点五（社长一人，生产队长八人，会计四十五人，记工员三十六人，技术员十二人，教员三十一人，团干五人）；在政治上有四十六人加入了共青团，两人参加了共产党。偃师县大口乡中学毕业生张光友担任生产组长后，由于他能够注意及时解决互助生产中的困难问题，团结组员，带动了各个生产组，把这个村庄各方面的工作都推动起来，各县类似这样的模范事例很多，不胜枚举。关于城市的中、小学毕业生参加生产问题，据郑州市统计，该市除了准备将今年的六千八百三十五个（市区三千九百七十三人）不能继续升学的中、小学毕业生安排到手工业和服务性行业的生产组织中参加生产和准备采用自学小组、合作学校和私立学校等办法，使之继续学习外，还打算大力动员组织城市青年去农村参加生产，根据初步摸索的结果，除思想障碍外，具体困难也还不少，如住宿、吃饭、生产股金、农具等，但今天农村已经高级合作化了，参加合作社的社员，不同于过去束缚在几亩土地上的个体农民，这一点对青年学生具有一定的吸引力，并且还有广大干部带头参加劳动生产，我们相信，只要我们工作艰苦深入具体帮助，这个方针是一定能够贯彻实现的。
    发挥群众办学的积极性
    其次，谈谈如何贯彻执行群众办学的问题。
    关于发动群众办学，我省群众过去是有兴办学校的优良传统的。在一九五二年以前，我省绝大部分小学和一部分中学，都是由地方群众采用多种形式发展起来的。历年来，由于我们对普及教育的方针政策在思想认识上不够明确，并且曾经规定了若干不利于放手发展的要求和限制，过分强调正规化，特别是在农业合作化基本完成以后，又错误地把大部分的民办小学由国家接办过来，使群众办学的积极性受到一定的影响。目前全省由厂矿、企业、机关团体举办的中学已有三所，学生二千九百零七人；小学三十三所，学生一千三百二十一人；群众合作举办的小学一千四百四十三所，学生十二万五千九百六十一人；初中班一处，学生五十九人。以上数字占全省学生总数的百分之二点六。此外还有私立小学六所，学生七百五十五人。今年省人委公布群众办学暂行办法以后，两个月来，仅郑州、开封两市已经举办和正在举办的机关、团体及私人举办的合作中学共五十七班，可以吸收学生两千八百人；校舍、经费、师资等问题，他们都能自己解决。这些事实说明，在国家可能举办的教育事业以外，依靠社会和群众力量，采用多种形式举办学校，以发挥群众办学的积极性，是可以适当地满足适龄儿童和暂时不能升学又不能参加生产的中、小学毕业生的学习要求的，应该大力提倡推动。总之，根据我省经验，只要领导上采取适当措施，充分发挥群众的积极性，就会很快地开展起来。
  轻视劳动的思想应受批判
    诸位代表：我们对这个方针的认识是通过实践不断提高的。我们的工作也是随着认识的提高不断前进的。我们当前的主要任务是继续加强政治思想教育，批判青年学生、家长和社会舆论方面轻视体力劳动的“学而优则仕”、“唯有读书高”等错误思想，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，同时还必须在各级党委和人民政府统一领导下，各方面密切配合，深入了解各方面需要用人的情况，为贯彻执行“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针，做好准备。至于过去在教学工作中对贯彻执行劳动教育的方针不够经常和在一定程度上的脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向，以及在普及教育工作中过分强调正规化等错误观点，我们准备在这次整风中认真的加以检查和克服。
