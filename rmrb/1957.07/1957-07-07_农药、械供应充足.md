To support agricultural cooperatives in vigorously eliminating pests and diseases and striving for a bumper harvest this year, supply and marketing cooperatives have strengthened the supply of pesticides and agricultural machinery.

By June 20, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country had organized 270,000 tons of pesticides such as "666," "DDT," and "1605," and 2,114,000 units of agricultural machinery such as sprayers, accounting for more than 90% of the annual sales plan, more than double the actual sales volume of the same period last year.

In order to realize the slogan "Where there are pests, there are pesticides and machinery," supply and marketing cooperatives have strengthened the distribution, transportation, and regional adjustment of pesticides and agricultural machinery. The wholesale station of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has successively allocated more than 10,000 tons of "666" pesticides to the main locust areas in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, and plans to transfer the pesticides needed by the three provinces in August and September in advance in July.

In order to deliver pesticides and agricultural machinery to farmers quickly, many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have adopted sales methods such as "delivering goods to the countryside" and "night market transactions." The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in the nine districts of Sui County, Hubei Province, drew more than 500 cadres to form more than 100 delivery teams to deliver goods to agricultural cooperatives, which was welcomed by farmers.

    农药、械供应充足
    本报讯　为了支援各地农业社大力扑灭病虫害，争取今年农业的大丰收，供销合作社加强了农药、农械的供应工作。
    到6月20日，全国各地供销社先后组织到“六六六”、“滴滴涕”、“一六○五”等农药二十七万吨，喷雾器等农械二百一十一万四千架，占全年销售计划的90％以上，比去年同期实销量增加一倍以上。
    为了实现“哪里有虫，哪里有药有械”的口号，供销社已经加强了农药、农械的分配、调运和地区间调剂工作。供销合作总社批发站先后已给河北、河南、山东三省主要蝗区，增拨“六六六”农药一万多吨，并计划将该三省8、9月份要的农药提前在7月份内调去。
    许多基层供销社为了把农药、农械很快地送到农民手里，采取了“送货下乡”、“夜市交易”等销货方法。湖北随县九个区的基层供销社抽调了五百多干部，组成一百多个送货小组，把货送给农业社，受到农民欢迎。　　　　　　（林）
