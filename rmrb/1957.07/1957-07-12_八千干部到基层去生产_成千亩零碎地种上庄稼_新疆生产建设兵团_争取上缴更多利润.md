The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, based on the spirit of "running farms diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily," is comprehensively launching a long-term campaign to increase production and practice economy.

In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the large and overlapping non-direct production organizations were resolutely reduced, merging those that should be merged and abolishing those that needed to be abolished, so that the existing organizations could better adapt to the needs of developing production. While streamlining the organizations, more than 8,000 cadres and students were sent down to the grassroots production units of more than 40 farms, ranches, and other enterprises in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains to engage in direct production. According to statistics from the Production Corps' Thrift Committee, enterprises in Urumqi alone, such as cooperatives, transportation, and engineering construction, can increase revenue by more than 7.2 million yuan this year, in addition to completing the original production plan, through measures to increase production and practice economy. Increased production and economy have accumulated construction funds, which has promoted the expansion of reproduction. Due to insufficient funds, the large-scale water conservancy projects and farms that were not originally planned to be built and opened this year have been decided to start construction ahead of schedule this year. The Mushroom Lake Reservoir, the largest reservoir in Xinjiang with a storage capacity of 150 million cubic meters, which is currently under construction, and the Yuqunweng Farm, which is being opened in the Ili reclamation area with more than 100,000 mu of land, were decided to be constructed after the investment problem was solved after the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched.

In terms of agricultural management, in order to strive for a bumper harvest and hand over more profits to the state, the farms generally adopted new agricultural technology measures, correctly utilized land, and implemented diversified operations. For example, in response to the shortcomings of excessive post-frost cotton flowers causing losses in previous years, the cotton farms generally adopted measures to leave more seedlings and fewer peaches per plant, controlling the maturity period and increasing pre-frost flowers to improve the economic value of cotton.

This year, the farms attached great importance to the utilization of land. Scattered small plots of land such as land near residences, the edges and corners of fields, channels, field ridges, and open spaces in forest belts were all utilized. It is understood that each farm has increased the planting of crops on these scattered plots of land by between 1,500 and 2,000 mu. According to the growth characteristics of corn and pumpkin, the farms in the Urumqi reclamation area implemented intercropping of pumpkin and corn, and in each mu of pumpkin land, in addition to harvesting a large amount of pumpkin, 100 to 125 kilograms of corn can also be harvested. In addition, after the harvest of 710,000 mu of summer crops this year, the farms generally carried out replanting to improve land utilization.

This year, in addition to vigorously developing agriculture, the farms also actively developed animal husbandry, mainly pig and cattle raising. Many farms operated wineries, oil mills, cotton gins, leather workshops, and other workshops according to their needs. Farms in Ili, Yanqi, and other reclamation areas also operated fisheries and beekeeping production. Farms near cities operated large-scale vegetables and vegetable gardens to supply the living needs of urban people.

    八千干部到基层去生产  成千亩零碎地种上庄稼
    新疆生产建设兵团  争取上缴更多利润
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团本着“勤俭办农场，勤俭办企业”的精神，全面开展长期性的增产节约运动。
    在增产节约运动中，首先对非直接生产的庞大重叠的机构坚决进行了缩减，该合并的合并了，需撤销的撤销了，使现存机构更适应于发展生产的需要。在精减机构的同时，把八千多名干部、学生下放到天山南北的四十多个农、牧场和其它企业的基层生产单位，从事直接生产。据生产兵团节约委员会统计，仅乌鲁木齐市的合作、运输、工程建筑等项企业，通过增产节约措施，今年除完成原订生产计划外，还可增加收入七百二十万余元。由于增产节约积累了建设资金，对扩大再生产起了推动作用。因为资金不足，原来不准备在今年兴建的大型水利工程和开辟的农场，已决定在今年提前动工。现在正在施工的蓄水一亿五千万立方的新疆最大水库——蘑菇湖水库，和正在伊犁垦区开辟的拥有十万余亩地的渔群翁农场，都是在开展增产节约运动以后，解决了投资问题才决定施工的。
    在农业的经营方面，为了争取农业大丰收，上缴国家更多利润，各农场普遍采用新的农业技术措施、正确利用土地和实行多种经营。如各植棉农场针对往年棉花霜后花多造成损失的缺点，普遍采用了多留苗、单株少留桃的措施，控制成熟期，增加霜前花，以提高棉花的经济价值。
    今年各农场很重视利用土地。宅旁地、地边地角、渠道、田埂和林带空地等零星小块土地，都利用起来了。据了解，每个农场仅利用这些零星土地增种的作物就在一千五百至二千亩之间。乌鲁木齐垦区各农场根据玉米和南瓜生长特点，实行南瓜与玉米间作，在每亩南瓜地里除收获大量的南瓜外，还可收到一百至一百二十五公斤玉米。此外，今年在七十一万亩夏收作物收获后，各农场都普遍进行了复播，以提高土地利用率。
    今年各农场除大力发展农业外，还积极发展以养猪、养牛为主的养畜业。许多农场根据需要经营了酿酒、榨油、轧花、皮革等作坊。伊犁、焉耆等垦区的农场还经营了渔业和养蜂业生产。邻近城市的农场大量经营蔬菜和菜园，供给城市人民的生活需要。
