Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 22nd: Northern Vietnam's summer rice harvest has been completed. According to the head of the Planting Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Northern Vietnam has achieved another bumper harvest of summer rice this year, with total output approaching the level of more than 1.59 million tons last year.

Areas in Northern Vietnam that used to suffer from waterlogging, drought, and seawater intrusion, resulting in poor harvests in previous years, have all achieved bumper harvests this year. In the Hong Quang and Hai Phong regions, which used to be frequently affected by seawater intrusion, the yield per hectare of summer rice this year exceeded the original plan by 200 to 400 kilograms. In the Henan, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, Shanxi, and Hedong provinces, the more than 70,000 Vietnamese acres (one Vietnamese acre equals five Chinese acres) of low-lying paddy fields that frequently suffered from poor harvests in previous years have increased production by an average of 15% to 20% compared to last year. The summer rice harvests in other regions are also very good.

According to relevant sources, the state plan stipulates a 2.6% increase in rice production this year. Agricultural departments in various regions are vigorously mobilizing farmers to cultivate autumn rice well. Supply and marketing cooperatives and trading companies in various provinces and cities are also actively preparing sufficient agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers for farmers in order to strive to complete this production increase task.

    越南北方夏稻又喜丰收
    产量接近去年一百五十九万吨水平
    新华社河内22日电　越南北方的夏稻已经收割完毕。据农林部种植司的负责人说，今年越南北方夏稻又获丰收，总产量接近去年的一百五十九万多吨的水平。
    越南北方往年经常遭受水涝，干旱和海水侵袭而歉收的地区，今年都获得丰收。在鸿广和海防往年经常遭海水侵袭的地区，今年夏稻的每公顷产量超过原订计划二百到四百公斤。河南、南定、宁平、山西、河东等省往年经常歉收的七万多越亩（一越亩合五市亩）低地稻田的，平均比去年增产15％到20％。其他一些地区的夏稻收成也很好。
    据有关方面人士指出，今年国家计划规定要增产稻谷2.6％。各地农业部门正在大力动员农民种好秋稻，各省、市供销合作社和贸易公司也在积极为农民准备充分的农具和化学肥料，以争取完成这项增产任务。
