A Scientific Worker's Suggestions for Developing Cement Industry Production
Wang Tao's Speech

I completely agree with Premier Zhou and other government leaders' reports, and have been inspired by them. Undeniable facts powerfully refute the fallacies of the right-wing elements, further exposing their reactionary conspiracies. I advise those who still persist in their errors to turn back as soon as possible, or they will isolate themselves from the people and head towards self-destruction.

Cement Production in the Last Five Years Equals Twice That of the Previous Fifty Years

Now I would like to express some opinions on the development of the cement industry. Although China's cement industry has a history of over fifty years, its true development has only begun in the last five or six years. The highest historical cement production was over 2.2 million tons in 1942. In 1952, we caught up with this level, and in 1956, we reached over 6.3 million tons, exceeding the target of the First Five-Year Plan. In other words, the production growth in the last five years is equivalent to twice that of the previous fifty years. In terms of varieties, we have learned advanced achievements, mainly from the Soviet Union, in recent years, and have successfully trial-produced 21 new types of cement, basically mastering the production technology of major international varieties. Some of these have been put into mass production, meeting most of the requirements of user departments and creating favorable conditions for expanding production, improving quality, and reducing costs. In terms of infrastructure, with the help of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, we have initially learned a set of skills from exploration and design to construction, and have established our own infrastructure teams, reversing the past situation of completely relying on foreigners to build factories. In restoring and renovating old factories and building new factories, this team has been strengthened and improved, basically adapting to the needs of the country. All cement industry workers are immensely excited and pleased by the brilliant achievements they have obtained through their hard work. Here, we want to thank the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries for their selfless help. We are even more grateful to the Communist Party of China and the People's Government for their wise leadership. Therefore, we resolutely oppose any attempt by a few right-wing elements to manipulate facts and distort the truth in order to achieve their personal political ambitions. Of course, it should be admitted that there are still some problems and shortcomings in our work. Now I would like to express my personal opinions on this aspect.

The Application Range of Cement is Becoming Wider and Wider

Cement is one of the most important building materials. Due to the recent development of cement product technology, especially the achievements in prestressed reinforced concrete, its application range has been further expanded. Cement products can replace steel and wood to a greater extent, which has not only been proven technically possible, but also economically reasonable under certain conditions. For example, replacing wooden railway sleepers with prestressed concrete sleepers, calculated at 4 million pieces, is equivalent to replacing 666,000 cubic meters of wooden sleepers with 200,000 tons of cement and 34,000 tons of steel, and its service life is four times longer than that of wooden sleepers. Replacing steel towers with reinforced concrete poles on transmission lines can not only save a lot of steel but also reduce investment. If we can replace one-third of the pit props used in coal mines with reinforced concrete poles, we can save more than 900,000 cubic meters of wood every year. Asbestos cement pipes and prestressed reinforced concrete pipes have proven that they can replace cast iron pipes in high-pressure water supply systems. Its cost is also relatively low. Internationally, asbestos cement pipes have been used to replace steel pipes in high-pressure oil pipelines and gas pipelines. All these achievements are even more important in China's current situation of tight steel and wood supply. Domestic departments concerned have done a lot of experimental research work in learning these advanced achievements, and some have even carried out small-scale production. Preliminary results show that they are largely suitable for domestic conditions. Therefore, how to further organize trial production or put them into production is worthy of our attention. In order to save investment and speed up construction, cement product workshops should be added to cement factories where conditions are suitable. In this way, the scale can grow from small to large, the cost of cement packaging can be saved during production, and it can also play a certain regulatory role in cement supply and marketing. Of course, cement product factories and user units with suitable conditions can also add workshops or factories according to the situation.

New Cement Plants Should Strive to Use Domestic Equipment

At present, China's cement manufacturing equipment basically relies on imports, and sometimes equipment acquisition conflicts with the progress of plant construction. On the other hand, because cement manufacturing equipment is bulky, transportation and miscellaneous expenses from abroad can sometimes reach 32% of the original price of the equipment. According to the preliminary inspection of the newly built Datong Cement Plant, if domestic equipment can be used and the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift is implemented, modifying the design can save 25% of the total investment. This is a large figure. Judging from China's current machine manufacturing level and conditions, this work should be possible. In fact, individual machines and certain parts have already been manufactured. As long as we can pay more attention to combining them with China's current situation and not excessively pursue the largest or most advanced, this problem should not be difficult to solve. I heard that the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry are cooperating to solve this problem. I sincerely hope to see it realized soon.

We Must Pay Attention to Small and Medium-Sized Factories and Existing Factories

The distribution of cement factories left over from the old society is very unreasonable today. In 1956, cement was transported from factories to construction sites, averaging 916 kilometers. This increased the burden on user departments and further exacerbated the tense transportation situation. China has a vast area. When choosing factory sites in the future, we should pay more attention to being close to the user areas. When choosing factory scale, we especially need to give due attention to small and medium-sized factories according to the situation. The previous idea of overemphasizing large factories is not comprehensive enough. Utilizing existing factories for renovation and expansion is much more cost-effective and faster than building new factories, both in terms of investment and speed. Under the premise of not affecting reasonable layout, it should be fully considered.

More Effective Use of Natural Resources and Industrial Waste

The issue of resources is a relatively weak link in the current development of the cement industry. On the one hand, the exploration force cannot fully meet the requirements of industrial development. On the other hand, many useful natural resources and industrial waste in China cannot be fully utilized. Asbestos is the main raw material for asbestos cement products and is also needed by other industries. According to preliminary investigations, more than a dozen provinces in China have asbestos resources. The ones that have been mined are Shimen County in Sichuan, Laiyuan County in Hebei, and Jin County in Liaoning. Among them, Sichuan has large reserves and good quality, and is more popular in domestic and foreign markets. These mines are operated by local governments. Due to unclear mineral deposits and backward production technology, the current production cannot meet the needs of domestic industry and foreign trade. The local authorities hope that the central government can provide assistance, especially in investment. Using blast furnace slag to manufacture cement can greatly save infrastructure investment and reduce production costs. Some advanced industrial countries have a slag utilization rate of 80%, while 70% of our current slag is not utilized, which is a great loss. With the development of the metallurgical industry, how to more effectively utilize slag can play a great role in the development of the cement industry. It is recommended that relevant departments can cooperate and coordinate more effectively and work together to improve this work.

Under the Leadership of the Party, Science Will Surely Develop Further

As a scientific research worker, I am excited to see that Vice Premier Bo's report regards scientific research work as a component of the national economic plan. In order to make scientific research work better serve our economic construction, I believe that both long-term planning and annual plans are necessary. This is precisely the embodiment of the Party's leadership over scientific work. With the further attention and care of the Party and the government for scientific work, it will surely be further developed.

China's cement industry is advancing rapidly in coordination with the national construction cause. In our work, we have encountered many difficulties and there are some shortcomings. But our goals are very clear, and our confidence is unprecedentedly firm. Let us better transform ourselves under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, more effectively exert all our strength, and continue to move forward for the common goal!

Whether it is appropriate or not, please correct me.

    一个科学工作者对发展水泥工业生产的建议
    王涛的发言
    我完全同意周总理和其他政府首长的报告，并且通过这些报告得到了启发。无可分辩的事实有力地驳斥了右派分子的谬论，进一步揭穿了他们的反动阴谋。奉劝一些至今仍然坚持错误的人们，如不及早回头，将会自绝于人民，自取灭亡的道路。
    水泥近五年产量增长数等于已往五十年的两倍
    现在我就水泥工业的发展发表一点意见。我国水泥工业，虽已有五十多年历史，但真正的发展在最近五、六年内才开始。历史上最高水泥产量为一九四二年的二百二十多万吨。一九五二年赶上了这个水准，一九五六年达到六百三十多万吨，超过了第一个五年计划的指标。也就是说，最近五年内产量增长数字相当于已往五十年的两倍。在品种方面，几年来学习了以苏联为主的先进成就，先后试制成功了二十一种新品种水泥，基本上掌握了国际间主要品种的生产技术。其中部分已大量投入生产，满足了使用部门的大部分要求，并为扩大生产、改善质量、降低成本创造了有利条件。基建方面，在苏联和兄弟国家的帮助下，初步学会了一套从勘探设计到施工的本领，建立了自己的基建队伍，扭转了过去完全依靠外国人来建厂的局面。在恢复改建旧厂及建设新厂中，这个队伍得到了壮大和提高，基本上适应了国家的要求。所有从事水泥工业的职工都为自己辛勤劳动所得到的辉煌成果而感到无比兴奋和愉快。在这里，我们要感谢苏联和其它兄弟国家的无私帮助。我们更要感谢中国共产党和人民政府的英明领导。为此，我们坚决反对少数右派分子玩弄手法歪曲事实，以便达到个人政治野心的任何企图。当然，应该承认，在我们的工作中也还存在着一些问题和缺点。现就这方面发表个人的意见。
    水泥的应用范围越来越大了
    水泥是重要建筑材料之一。由于近来水泥制品工艺上的发展，特别在预引力钢筋混凝土方面的成就，更加扩大了它的应用范围。水泥制品在更大程度上可以代替钢铁和木材，不仅在技术上证明了它的可能性，而且在一定条件下经济上也是合理的。例如：用预引力混凝土制成的铁道轨枕代替枕木，如以四百万根计算，就等于用二十万吨水泥和三万四千吨钢材代替六十六万六千立方公尺的枕木木材，并且它的使用年限要比枕木大四倍。在输电路线上用钢筋混凝土电柱代替钢塔，不仅可以节省大量钢材，并且可以降低投资。我们如能把三分之一的煤矿用的坑木用钢筋混凝土杆子代替，就可以每年替出九十多万立方公尺的木材。石棉水泥管及预引力钢筋混凝土管已经证明可以代替铸铁管用在高压上水道中。它的成本也比较低。国际间已经有用石棉水泥管代替钢管用在高压输油管及煤气管等地方。所有这些成就，在我国当前钢材木材相当紧张的情况下，其意义就更加重要。国内有关部门在学习这些先进成就方面已经做了不少试验研究工作，有的还进行了小规模的生产。初步结果证明在很大程度上是适合国内情况的。因此如何进一步组织试生产或投入生产是值得我们重视的。为了节约投资加快速度建设，在条件适合的水泥工厂中加设水泥制品车间。这样做，在规模方面可以由小而大，在生产时可以节约水泥包装成本，而且还可以对水泥供销起一定调节作用。当然，在有条件的水泥制品工厂以及使用单位，也可以根据情况添设车间或工厂。
    新建水泥厂应力求采用国产设备
    目前我国水泥制造设备基本上依靠进口，有时设备取得和建厂进度发生矛盾。另一方面，由于水泥制造设备体积庞大，从国外进口运杂费一项有时就可达设备原价的百分之三十二。根据对新建大同水泥厂的初步检查，如能采用国产设备同时贯彻勤俭建国方针，修正设计就可节约总投资的百分之二十五。这是一个很大的数字。就我国目前机器制造水平及条件来说应当可以承担这个工作的。事实上，个别机器及某些部件已在制造，只要我们能够多注意结合我国当前情况，不要过分的追求最大的或最先进的，这个问题应该不难解决。听说第一机械工业部及建筑材料工业部正在合作解决这个问题。衷心希望能早日见到实现。
    要重视中小型工厂和现有工厂
    旧社会遗留下来的水泥工厂分布情况，就今天来说，是非常不合理的。一九五六年水泥从工厂运到工地，平均要走九百一十六公里的路。这样就增加了使用部门的负担，而且更加促成运输的紧张局面。我国地区广大，今后在选择厂址时，固应更重视接近使用区域，选择工厂规模时，尤其需要根据情况对中小型工厂予以应有的重视。已往过分强调大型工厂的想法是不够全面的。利用现有工厂进行改建、扩建，无论从投资上或速度上都比新建厂合算得多，在不影响合理布局下，似应充分考虑。
    更有效地利用天然资源和工业废料
    资源问题在当前水泥工业的发展中是一个比较薄弱的环节。一方面勘探力量尚不能完全满足工业发展要求，另一方面国内不少有用天然资源及工业废料尚不能得到充分利用。石棉是石棉水泥制品的主要原料，也为其它工业所需要。据初步调查，我国有十多个省蕴藏石棉资源，已开采的有四川石棉县、河北涞源县及辽宁金县等，其中四川的藏量大、质量好，更受到国内外市场的欢迎。这些矿均由地方经营，由于矿藏不清、生产技术落后，目前生产量远不能满足国内工业和对外贸易需要。地方主管部门希望中央予以帮助，特别在投资方面能够得到适当安排。利用高炉矿渣制造水泥可以大量节约基建投资及降低生产成本。有些先进工业国家的矿渣利用率达到百分之八十，而我们目前百分之七十的矿渣尚未利用，这是一个很大的损失。随着冶金工业的发展，如何更有效的利用矿渣，对水泥工业的发展可起很大作用。建议有关部门能够更有效的配合协作，共同努力改进这方面工作。
    在党领导下科学必将更进一步发展
    作为一个科学研究工作者，我兴奋的看到薄副总理报告中把科学研究工作作为国家国民经济计划的一个组成部分。为了使科学研究工作更好的服务于我们的经济建设，我认为长远规划和年度计划都是必要的。这正是体现着党对科学工作的领导。随着党和政府对科学工作进一步的重视和关怀，它必将更进一步的得到发展。
    我国水泥工业正在配合着全国建设事业飞跃的前进。在工作中也遭遇到了不少困难和存在一些缺点。但我们的目标非常明确，我们的信心空前坚定。让我们在中国共产党领导下更好的改造自己，更有效的发挥一切力量，为了共同的目的继续前进吧！
    是否有当，请指正。
