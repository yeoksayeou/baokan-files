Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The Ministry of Agriculture today issued a notice to all regions regarding strengthening the prevention and control of summer and autumn crop diseases and pests.

    The notice pointed out that the rice stem borer damage in early rice paddies in the south this year is generally mild. However, the first generation of stem borer moths laying eggs in the fields is relatively common, increasing the difficulty of prevention and control. Although the aphid infestation period in the northern cotton areas has been delayed, it is currently increasing rapidly, and cotton seedling leaf curling is quite serious. The area and density of summer locusts occurring in coastal and lakeside locust areas are smaller than last year. In the waterlogged locust areas bordering Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, the locusts are very serious due to late detection, wide spread, and high density. However, after vigorous elimination by various regions, the summer locusts have been basically eliminated. Currently, work is underway to eliminate remaining locusts and prepare for the prevention and control of autumn locusts.

    Based on the current disease and pest occurrence situation and the complex forecast of summer and autumn weather changes, it is estimated that other various diseases and pests may develop and cause greater harm. In particular, the rice leaf folder, rice planthopper, leafhopper, rice gall midge, and rice blast in the southern rice areas; the armyworm, corn borer, and potato late blight in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and North China; the cotton bollworm and pink bollworm in the cotton areas; as well as the apple codling moth, pear scab, and citrus scab, etc. As for disaster areas, more vigilance should be exercised against the possible concentrated harm caused by rats.

    The notice stated that earnestly doing a good job in the prevention and control of summer and autumn crop diseases and pests and striving for a great agricultural harvest this year is of great significance. The notice specifically put forward the following suggestions:

    1. Provinces in locust areas should continue to strengthen the work of eliminating remaining summer locusts, delineate the area for autumn locust prevention and control, and prepare the necessary pesticides, machinery, and manpower for the prevention and control of autumn locusts. Other regions should seize favorable opportunities to eliminate pests, targeting different diseases and pests and using various methods. 2. During the busy summer and autumn seasons, all regions should take local conditions into consideration, make overall plans, and properly arrange the use of labor. 3. This year, supply and marketing departments have prepared relatively sufficient pesticides and machinery. For agricultural cooperatives with financial difficulties or serious disasters, solutions can be found through loans or short-term credit sales. In the use of highly toxic pesticides, strict adherence to operating procedures is required. It is imperative to continue to prevent the occurrence of poisoning accidents involving humans and animals. It is absolutely forbidden to use highly toxic pesticides on fruit trees approaching harvest. 4. All regions must make full use of disease and pest information to guide prevention and control in a timely manner.

### 夏秋气候变化无常　多种病虫容易发展  农业部通知加强防治农作物病虫害

    夏秋气候变化无常　多种病虫容易发展
    农业部通知加强防治农作物病虫害
    据新华社5日讯　农业部今天向各地发出关于加强夏秋农作物病虫害防治的通知。
    通知指出，今年南方早稻秧田螟害一般轻微。但第一代螟蛾在本田产卵比较普遍，增加了防治上的困难；北部棉区棉蚜为害时期虽有推迟，而目前增殖很快，棉苗卷叶现象相当严重；沿海、滨湖蝗区夏蝗发生的面积和密度均比去年小；河北、河南、山东三省毗连的内涝蝗区，因发现迟，扩散面积广，密度高，蝗虫十分严重，但经过各地大力除治，夏蝗已基本消灭。目前正开展扫残及准备防治秋蝗的工作。
    根据当前病虫发生情况及夏秋气象变化复杂的预报，估计其他多种病虫有发展与造成较大危害的可能。特别是南方稻区的稻苞虫、稻飞虱、浮尘子、稻瘿蝇及稻瘟病；东北、内蒙古、华北等地的粘虫、玉米螟和马铃薯晚疫病；棉区的棉铃虫及红铃虫；以及苹果食心虫、梨黑星病和柑桔疮痂病等。至于水灾地区，更应警惕可能形成的鼠类集中为害现象。
    通知提出，认真做好夏秋农作物病虫害防治工作，争取今年农业大丰收是有极大意义的。通知中特提出以下几项意见：
    一、蝗区各省应继续加强对夏蝗的扫残工作，划出秋蝗防治面积，做好防治秋蝗的药械和人力准备工作；其他各地，应针对不同病虫，抓紧有利时机。使用各种方法，加以消灭虫害。二、夏秋季节农事较忙，各地应根据地方情况，统筹兼顾，妥善安排劳动力的使用。三、今年供销部门药械准备比较充足，对资金困难或灾情严重的农业社，可通过贷款或短期赊销等办法来解决。在使用剧毒性的农药中，要严格按照操作规程办事。必须切实作到防治人、畜中毒事故的继续发生。凡接近收获期的果树，要绝对禁止使用剧毒性农药。四、各地必须充分利用病虫情报，及时指导防治。
