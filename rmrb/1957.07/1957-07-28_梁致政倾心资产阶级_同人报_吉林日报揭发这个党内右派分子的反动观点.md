    Liang Zhizheng Inclined Towards Bourgeois "Clique Newspapers"
    Jilin Daily Exposes the Reactionary Views of This Rightist Element Within the Party
    (Our dispatch from Changchun, July 25) Jilin Daily and Changchun Daily have held meetings of all staff members in recent days to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Liang Zhizheng, editor of the Jilin Daily's literary section and a rightist element within the Party.
    At a forum held by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China for the press and publishing circles, Liang Zhizheng viciously attacked the Party's leadership over newspapers. He openly proposed that newspapers should be composed of an editorial board of people with expertise and talent, elected by all members of the newspaper. This absurd proposition of his, made with ulterior motives, was severely refuted. Many people at the meeting pointed out that his so-called democratically elected editorial board was, in reality, a rejection of the Party's leadership and an attempt to turn Party-led newspapers into bourgeois clique newspapers.
    Everyone pointed out that in Liang Zhizheng's mind, he admired Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily, which had once moved in a bourgeois direction, and praised their talent for starting fires everywhere and attacking the Party. When Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily were rampantly attacking the Party, he applauded loudly. He hoped that Jilin Daily would also be like Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, starting fires everywhere and opposing the Party's leadership. He encouraged individuals who were dissatisfied with the Party to "speak out boldly" and not be "cowards." He reviled Party activists as "thugs," "teachers," and "sycophants." Jilin Daily and Changchun Daily are continuing to refute these reactionary remarks and are also beginning to expose some rightist remarks similar to those of Liang Zhizheng.

    梁致政倾心资产阶级“同人报”
    吉林日报揭发这个党内右派分子的反动观点
    本报长春25日电  吉林日报、长春日报连日来分别举行全体工作人员会议，揭露和批判吉林日报文艺组编辑、党内右派分子梁致政的反动言行。
    梁致政在中共吉林省委召开的新闻出版界座谈会上，曾经恶毒地攻击党对于报纸的领导，他公然提出报纸应当以有专长有才能的一些人来组成报社的编委会，并由全社人员选举产生。他这种别有用心的荒谬主张，遭到了严厉的驳斥。许多人在会议上指出他主张的所谓民选编委会，实际上就是不要党的领导，就是企图把党领导的报纸变成资产阶级的同人报。
    大家指出：在梁致政的心目中，羡慕的是一度走向资产阶级方向的文汇报、光明日报，赞赏的是那种到处点火、对党进攻的才干。当文汇报、光明日报猖狂地向党进攻的时候，他拍案叫绝。他希望吉林日报也要像光明日报、文汇报那样去到处点火，反对党的领导。他鼓动个别对党不满的人“大胆放”、不当“胆小鬼”。他谩骂党的积极分子是“打手”“教师爷”“献媚者”。吉林日报、长春日报正在继续批驳他这些反动言论，同时也开始揭露一些类似梁致政的右派言行。
