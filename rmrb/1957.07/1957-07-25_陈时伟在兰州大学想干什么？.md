Chen Shiwei and his Anti-Party Group at Lanzhou University

By Our Correspondent Gu Lei

Teachers and students at Lanzhou University have launched a struggle against the anti-Communist group led by Vice President Chen Shiwei, beginning to expose the conspiracy of right-wing ambitious Chen Shiwei to drive the Communist Party out of Lanzhou University and seize leadership.

From the day Lanzhou was liberated in 1949, he deliberately opposed the Party and wanted to stir up trouble.

In August 1949, when our military representatives took over Lanzhou University, they organized teachers and students close to the Party to form a takeover committee to carry out various inventory tasks. At that time, Chen Shiwei was the Dean of the School of Science at Lanzhou University. He secretly slandered the military representatives as "country bumpkins" who did not know how to run a university, inciting students to resist the takeover. Then, a wall poster was posted, insulting the Communist Party. In a painting, several animal-like creatures were drawn fighting over excrement, using this to compare the Communist Party and those who helped the Party carry out the takeover. Another painting satirized Professor Xu Hefu, the director of the takeover committee, for "saying nice things and doing bad things."

At the same time as the takeover of Lanzhou University, the People's Liberation Army was advancing into Qinghai. Due to the lack of medicine for the troops, the military control committee decided to transfer some medicines from the affiliated hospital of Lanzhou University to support the westward advance. At this time, Chen Shiwei actually condoned and supported a group of students to stop the cars carrying the medicines. Afterwards, Chen told others that the medicines in the affiliated hospital were not enough for their own use! In fact, some medicines were enough for many years.

Chen Shiwei also incited students of the School of Science to establish the "Science and Engineering Society," control the student union, and propose that Party and League members should not be elected as members of the student union. Soon, the Lanzhou branch of the People's Revolutionary University moved to Lanzhou University. Chen Shiwei was very dissatisfied with this, saying that the students of the Revolutionary University were spreading communist air and that the Revolutionary University did not look like a university. Then, the "Science and Engineering Society" controlled by Chen launched a signature campaign, proposing to "arm themselves to drive away the Revolutionary University."

During the summer vacation of 1950, a strike led by Chen Shiwei and Zuo Zongzhen (head of the Chemistry Department) and several other teachers occurred at Lanzhou University, attempting to prevent the school from starting classes, incite students' dissatisfaction with the Party, and try to use this threatening means to get a bigger "official" position.

Using the Jiusan Society as a tool to organize right-wing groups, using his position to expand his "wings."

As a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Chairman of the Lanzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society, Chen Shiwei has always regarded the Jiusan Society as a tool for organizing right-wing groups. Among the five people who Chen Shiwei initially initiated to organize the "Jiusan Society," three were his confidants, who later became the main generals in attacking the Party. In order to win over members, he said, "Joining Jiusan can solve any problem and everything is guaranteed." He often pulled those who were dissatisfied with the Party into the society.

Chen Shiwei also used his position as vice president to expand his own power. He gave these people salary increases, promotions, and official positions, and seized positions. A certain professor was a bureaucrat before liberation, but after liberation, he became a professor under Chen's "care." After Chen became vice president, he saw that among the four departments of the School of Science, only the head of the Mathematics Department was not one of his own. He pulled Liu Gujie, who had a special relationship with him, from other places to Lanzhou University and placed him in the Mathematics Department in order to seize the position of head of the department. Chen also conspired to appoint Hong Chuanjing as the dean of the Law School. Hong was a restoration element and a major general instructor at the pseudo-Central Military Academy. Chen was promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel at the military academy with Hong's promotion. Therefore, a saying was popular in Lanzhou University: Once you enter Chen's door, you become an expert!

Chen Shiwei called professors who were not his confidants and close to the Party "lackeys" and looked for opportunities to attack them at all times. In the early days of liberation, he tried his best to oppose teachers such as Liu Rangyan, Liu Jiazen, Luo Xiufeng, Li Yeqian, and Feng Shengwu who actively participated in the takeover. After the ideological remolding movement, Chen Shiwei again attacked teachers such as Ge Fuxiang, Zhao Congxian, Zhao Jiyou, Shu Lianjing, and Li Duanyan who actively participated in ideological remolding, and opposed giving these people suitable jobs and reasonable remuneration. Even worse, he obstructed Professor Ge Fuxiang's research on thorium refining and squeezed out Xiao Shixun and others.

Chen Shiwei often used double-dealing tactics to attack Party responsible comrades in the school. When Comrade Qu Zheng was the first president, Chen Shiwei initially expressed "welcome," but soon secretly scolded Qu as a sectarian, saying that Qu Zheng had studied in Germany and Japan and must have fascist ideas. When Comrade Lin Disheng was the president, he also initially expressed "welcome," but soon secretly scolded Lin Disheng as a "confused sectarian," saying that Lin Disheng "didn't know how to run a university and never studied how to run the school well." Comrade Lu Runlin, the deputy director of academic affairs, had been scolded for several years. In short, all Party responsible comrades were pointed out by Chen Shiwei as unlearned people in order to incite teachers and students to oppose the Party and weaken the Party's prestige in the school.

When the rectification movement began, he thought that the time to overthrow the Party had come, so he launched a fierce offensive.

In Chen Shiwei's view, "helping the Party rectify its work style" was a good opportunity to seize leadership. Therefore, after the Zhang-Luo anti-Party clique launched an attack on the Party, Chen Shiwei's anti-Communist group quickly responded in Lanzhou University.

They used symposiums and radio speeches to attack the Party. Chen Shiwei said: "Individual Party responsible comrades in colleges and universities do not understand the arduousness of academic work, do not understand the role of scientists in socialist construction, deliberately increase the trouble of scientific workers, and even attack and exclude scientists." Zuo Zongzhen added notes to Chen's words, saying that the main problem in Lanzhou University was that Party leading cadres did not trust non-Party people, which was serious sectarianism. The current deputy director of academic affairs, Lu Runlin (a Party member), was the founder and host, and President Lin was the protector. Liu Gujie, Chen's general, also bitingly asserted that the Party负责人负责人 in Lanzhou University cultivated personal forces, carried out wooing and suppression, and excluded good professors. Zuo Zongzhen said: "There are not many experts in the school Party committee, and if there is a deviation, it is easy to cause a comprehensive error." Chen Shiwei said that Lanzhou University was "slow in progress, lifeless, demoralized, and the academic atmosphere was thin" to confirm that Zuo's words were correct. After this group of people described the work of Lanzhou University as very bad and described the Party members of Lanzhou University as worthless, they then openly proposed to establish a school affairs committee mainly composed of professors as the highest authority of the school and elect the president.

Under the instigation of Chen Shiwei and others, some naive students at Lanzhou University echoed and posted big-character posters everywhere, scolding the Party responsible comrades as sectarianists, saying that Lanzhou University was "shaky and in imminent danger." Each department and class established a "Great Blooming and Contending Committee" and sent representatives to request the establishment of a school-wide blooming and contending committee to "save" Lanzhou University. In order to widely listen to everyone's criticisms, the school Party committee agreed to establish a school-wide blooming and contending committee. When the members were elected as chairman, Chen Shiwei had already matured in advance and seized the title of chairman. When discussing the work guidelines and plans of the blooming and contending committee, committee member Li Tingtao openly proposed that he should not be led by the school Party committee, and Chen Shiwei expressed "complete agreement." Then, big-character posters appeared in the school, demanding that "League Secretary Liu Zhongyu (a Party member) get out of the Blooming and Contending Committee!" Chen Shiwei also remained silent.

He wanted to force Party President Lin Disheng to resign and instigated people to propose a list of reorganized Lanzhou University leaders.

Chen Shiwei knew that if he wanted to drive away the school Party committee, he could not do it without opening a knife to the Party responsible comrades in the school. Therefore, he seized the issue of teachers that students were most concerned about, and at a blooming and contending conference in the Chemistry Department that did not allow Communist Party members to participate, he groundlessly attacked President Lin Disheng to more than 1,000 students. He said that Lin Disheng did not welcome good professors, sometimes refused to hire them, and sometimes ignored them, thinking that good professors were not easy to lead; he also said that Lin Disheng did not take care of the conditions for teachers' teaching and scientific research, and sometimes even deliberately made things difficult for him. This fire was very successful, pushing the anti-communist countercurrent in Lanzhou University to a climax. After the meeting, big-character posters appeared everywhere saying "Lin Disheng should resign automatically", "Revoke all positions of Lu Runlin", "No slander, slander or smear against Vice President Chen", "Vice President Chen is innocent". Xu Changkun, a teaching assistant in the Chemistry Department, who was controlled by Chen Shiwei, Zuo Zongzhen, etc., also clamored to beat Comrade Lu Runlin. At the same time, a list of reorganized Lanzhou University leaders circulated in the school, including Chen Shiwei but not Lin Disheng and Lu Runlin. After investigation, this list came from several young teaching assistants who were close to Chen Shiwei. At this time, Chen Shiwei's arrogance was very strong, and he constantly received student representatives, completely ignoring the Party committee, and only waited to drink to victory!

Inciting students to petition in Beijing

After Chen Shiwei set fire at the Chemistry Department conference, the deceived students wanted to send representatives to Beijing to petition, demanding to solve the problems of teachers and funding at Lanzhou University. The school Party committee and President Lin Disheng repeatedly dissuaded them, but Chen Shiwei actively supported them. At the meeting of the Blooming and Contending Committee, he did not listen to the Party committee's advice, and did not mention the reactionary remarks that appeared in the school, but was enthusiastic about discussing how to send a delegation. Before the student delegation set off, Xiao Fan, an activist in the delegation, went to Chen Shiwei's house to play. Chen praised Xiao Fan for being young and capable, and said that he would definitely stay in school to teach when Xiao graduated, encouraging Xiao to actively participate in the activities of the delegation. He also told representative Zhou Yongning to make a "name" for himself if he wanted to make trouble. Before the departure of some students of the delegation, they visited Chen and asked him how the problems of Lanzhou University could be solved. Chen implied that it would be difficult for Lin Disheng and Lu Runlin not to leave, and gave the delegation a hint of the purpose of the petition. This coincided with another incident. On June 11, the school wrote a rectification report to the Ministry of Higher Education, in which there was a sentence "Some people think that Deputy Director of Academic Affairs Lu is the founder of sectarianism in Lanzhou University", Chen Shiwei actually added the word "人" to "一" and changed it to "大".

Now is the time to pay the debt.

In the past 20 days, teachers and students of Lanzhou University have held conferences and small meetings to criticize Chen Shiwei's anti-Party group.

Students who were deceived and expressed dissatisfaction with the Party in the past have also become aware of it and actively participated in the struggle. Student representatives who were incited by Chen Shiwei to petition in Beijing accused Chen Shiwei of leading them astray, and said that they were sorry for the Party and the country, and were willing to transform themselves in the struggle and be good students.

The members of Chen Shiwei's anti-Party group have also begun to differentiate, and two of them are writing materials to expose the inside story of the group. The entire Lanzhou University is full of voices struggling against the rightists.

In the process of the anti-rightist struggle, Chen Shiwei has always adopted a resistant attitude. For example, he once slandered President Lin Disheng for excluding scientists. At a criticism meeting, someone asked Chen to give an example to illustrate this. He thought about it and only gave one thing, saying that Zuo Zongzhen bought a few locks and the school did not reimburse him. In fact, Lin Disheng did not know about this at first. After knowing about it, he not only reimbursed him, but also criticized the relevant personnel. Faced with this fact, Chen Shiwei still refused to admit his mistake. He launched a new challenge to the Party. For example, when he was criticized by the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, he said: "You are not the personnel department or the public security bureau, and you cannot fabricate facts."

    陈时伟在兰州大学想干什么？
    本报记者　顾雷
    兰州大学的教师和学生，连日向副校长陈时伟反共集团展开了斗争，开始揭破了右派野心家陈时伟要把共产党赶出兰大、夺取兰大领导权的阴谋。
    从1949年兰州解放那天起，他就蓄意反对党，唯恐天下不乱
    1949年8月，兰州解放。我军事代表接管兰州大学时，曾组织学校中靠近党的教师、学生，组成接管委员会，进行各项清点工作。当时，陈时伟是兰大理学院院长，他暗地里诽谤军事代表是“土包子”，不懂得如何办大学，煽动学生抗拒接管。接着贴出来一张辱骂共产党的壁报。在一幅画上，画着几个似人似狗的动物抢屎吃，以此比喻共产党和帮助党进行接管工作的人。另有一幅画，讽刺接管委员会主任徐褐夫教授“好话说尽，坏事做完”。
    接管兰大的同时，人民解放军正进军青海。因部队医药不足，军管会决定从兰大附设医院调出部分药品，支援西进的部队。这时，陈时伟竟纵容、支持一群学生拦住拉药品的汽车。事后，陈告诉别人说，附设医院的药品还不够自己用的呢！实际上有些药够用很多年。
    陈时伟还煽动理学院的学生成立“理工学会”，把持学生会，提出党、团员不得当选为学生会委员。不久，人民革命大学兰州分校迁到兰大。陈时伟对此事很不满意，说革大学生是散布共产主义空气的，说革大不像个大学的样子。接着，被陈掌握的“理工学会”就发起了签名运动，提出“武装赶走革大”。
    1950年暑假时，兰大发生了以陈时伟、左宗?（化学系主任）为首的几个教师出走的罢教事件，企图使学校开不成课，煽起学生对党的不满，并想用这种威胁手段闹个大一点的“官”做。
    把九三学社当作组织右派集团的工具，利用职权扩展他的“羽翼”
    作为九三学社中央委员、九三学社兰州分社主任委员的陈时伟，一直把九三学社当作组织右派集团的工具。在陈时伟开始发起组织“九三学社”的五个人中，有三个是他的心腹，后来都成为向党进攻的主将。他为了拉拢社员，说什么“参加九三，什么问题都能解决，一切都有保障。”他常常拉那些对党不满的人入社。
    陈时伟还利用副校长的职权，扩展自己的羽翼。他为这些人加薪晋级、提拔封官，抢夺阵地。某教授解放前是官僚，解放后竟在陈的“关怀”下变成了教授。陈任副校长后，看到理学院的四个系中，只有数学系主任不是自己人，便从外地拉一个和自己有特殊关系的刘古杰到兰大，安插到数学系，以便夺取系主任的职务。陈还曾阴谋派洪传经担任法学院院长。洪是复兴分子，是伪中央军官学校的少将教官，陈在军官学校是得到洪的提携才由中校升为上校的。因此，在兰大里流行一句话：一登陈门便成专家了！
    对不是自己亲信、靠近党的教授，陈时伟则称作“奴才”，时刻寻找打击的机会。解放初期，他极力反对积极参加接管的刘让言、刘嘉曾、骆秀峰、李叶乾、冯绳武等教师。思想改造运动以后，陈时伟又打击积极参加思想改造的戈福祥、赵从显、赵继游、舒连景、李端严等教师，反对给这些人以合适的工作岗位和合理劳动报酬。更恶劣的是他竟阻难戈福祥教授进行提炼钍的研究，并挤走萧士恂等人。
    陈时伟常用两面手法攻击学校里的党员负责同志。曲正同志任第一任校长时，陈时伟开始时表示“欢迎”，不久就背地里骂曲正是宗派主义者，说曲正留学德国、日本，一定有法西斯思想。林迪生同志任校长时，开始时他也表示“欢迎”，不久就背地骂林迪生是“糊里糊涂的宗派主义者”，说林迪生“不懂如何办大学，从来不研究如何办好学校”。副教务长陆润林同志，一直被骂了几年。总之所有党员负责同志，都被陈时伟指为不学无术的人，以煽动师生与党员对立，削弱党在学校中的威信。
    整风运动开始，他认为推翻党的时机到来了，于是发动了猛烈的攻势
      在陈时伟看来，“帮助党整风”是夺取领导权的良机。所以当章、罗反党集团向党展开进攻后，陈时伟反共集团迅速在兰大呼应起来。
    他们利用座谈会和广播讲话，向党进行攻击。陈时伟说：“个别高等学校党员负责同志不了解学术工作的艰巨性，不了解科学家在社会主义建设中的作用，有意识增加科学工作者的麻烦，甚至打击排挤科学家。”左宗?便给陈的话加注，说兰大存在的问题主要是党员领导干部不信任党外人士，是严重的宗派主义，现任副教务长陆润林（党员）是奠基者和主持者，林校长是保护者。陈的大将刘古杰也跟着一口咬定兰大的党员负责人培植私人势力，进行拉拢打击，排挤好教授。左宗?说：“学校党委中内行不多，一有偏差就容易造成全面错误。”陈时伟便说兰大“进步迟缓、生气消沉、人心涣散、学术空气稀薄”，以证实左的话不错。这一批人把兰州大学的工作说得非常糟，把兰大的党员形容得一个钱不值以后，接着公开提出了以教授为主成立校务委员会，作为学校的最高权力机关，选举校长。
    在陈时伟等人的煽惑下，兰大一部分幼稚的学生随声附和，到处张贴大字报，骂党员负责同志是宗派主义者，说兰大是“摇摇欲坠、千钧一发”。各系、班级成立了大鸣大放委员会，并派代表要求成立全校的鸣放委员会，以“挽救”兰大。学校党委为了广泛地听取大家的批评，同意成立校的鸣放委员会。在委员们推举主任委员时，陈时伟早已事前酝酿成熟，抓住了主任委员的头衔。在讨论鸣放委员会工作方针、计划时，委员李廷涛公开提出不受学校党委的领导，陈时伟表示“完全同意。”接着，校内出现了大字报，要“团委记书刘众语（党员）滚出鸣放委员会去！”陈时伟也默不作声。
    他要逼迫党员校长林迪生辞职，并唆使人提出一个改组兰大领导人员的名单
    陈时伟知道，想赶走学校党委，不向学校的党员负责同志开刀是不行的。因此，他抓住学生最关心的师资问题，在一次不让共产党员参加的化学系的鸣放大会上，向一千多名学生无中生有地攻击了校长林迪生同志。他说林迪生不欢迎好教授，有时拒绝聘请，有时置之不理，认为好教授不好领导；还说林迪生对教师们教学和科学研究的条件不照顾，有时竟跟他有意为难。这把火放得很成功，把兰大的反共逆流推向了高潮。会后，到处出现了“林迪生应自动辞职”、“撤消陆润林一切职务”、“不许向陈副校长进行任何造谣、中伤、诬蔑”，“陈副校长无罪”，等大字报。被陈时伟、左宗?等掌握的化学系助教徐长昆等，还扬言要打陆润林同志。同时，在学校里流行了一张改组兰大领导人员的名单，其中有陈时伟而没有林迪生、陆润林了。后经调查，这个名单出自同陈时伟相近的几个青年助教之手。这时候的陈时伟气焰很盛，不断接见学生代表，全不把党委放在眼里，只等着为胜利干杯了！
    煽动学生到北京请愿
    陈时伟在化学系大会上点火之后，被蒙蔽的学生要派代表赴北京请愿，要求解决兰大的师资、经费等问题。学校党委和校长林迪生，一再劝阻，但陈时伟却积极加以支持，他在鸣放委员会会议上，不听党委劝告，对学校中出现的反动言论只字不提，只是热心于讨论如何派出代表团的事。学生代表团动身前，代表团的积极分子肖藩到陈时伟家里玩，陈夸奖肖藩年青、能干，并说等肖毕业时一定留校作教学工作，鼓励肖积极参加代表团的活动。并告诉代表周永宁，要闹就闹出个“名堂”。代表团一部分学生动身前去访陈，问他兰大问题怎样才能得到解决，陈暗示林迪生、陆润林不走很困难，给代表团提示请愿的目的。这正和另一件事相映。6月11日，校学给高教部写了一份整风报告，其中有一句“一部分人认为陆副教务长是兰大宗派主义的奠基者”，陈时伟竟将“一”字上添个“人”字，变成了“大”字。
    现在是还债的时候了
    最近二十天来，兰州大学的师生，连续召开大会、小会，批判陈时伟反党集团。
    过去被陈时伟等欺骗蒙蔽而对党表示不满的学生，也都觉悟了，积极起来参加斗争。曾被陈时伟煽动赴北京请愿的学生代表都控诉陈时伟把他们引入歧路的罪行，并表示自己对不起党，对不起国家，愿意在斗争中改造自己，做一个好学生。
    陈时伟反党集团中的分子也开始分化，有两个人正在写材料揭发这个集团的内幕。整个兰州大学，到处响着斗争右派的声音。
    在反右派斗争过程中，陈时伟一直采取抗拒态度。例如，他曾诽谤校长林迪生排挤科学家。在一次批判会上，有人要陈举例说明，他想来想去只举出一件事，说左宗?有次买了几把锁，学校未予报销。事实上，林迪生开始并不知道此事，事后知道了不但给报销了，而且还批评了有关人员。面对这个事实，陈时伟仍不认错。向党进行新的挑战。例如，当他受到九三学社中央的批评的时候，他竟说：“你们不是人事处、公安局，不能捏造事实。”
