    Dulles Closes the Door on Disarmament
    Commentator of this newspaper

    On the 22nd, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on the issue of disarmament. In this lengthy speech, Dulles went to great lengths to defend the West's delaying tactics in disarmament negotiations and closed the door on several major substantive issues.

    First, Dulles once again harped on the old tune of the U.S.'s "position of strength policy" and vigorously spread an atmosphere of international mistrust, groundlessly slandering the Soviet Union. Under the cover of this "Cold War" fanfare, Dulles announced three major "impossibilities." First, relying solely on promises is unworkable. Therefore, the United States "will never change its military position by completely trusting paper promises." Second, guaranteeing the abolition of nuclear weapons is unworkable. Therefore, "in formulating plans, we must assume that these weapons will be used in war." Third, accurately calculating the military strength of both sides is unworkable. Therefore, proportional reduction of armaments is impossible.

    As everyone knows, disarmament negotiations are originally intended to seek gradual agreements, eliminate international mistrust, thereby easing international tensions, ending the arms race, and achieving complete disarmament and the complete prohibition of all nuclear weapons. However, the basic attitude of the United States, as expressed by Dulles, is tantamount to a complete denial of the basis for conducting disarmament negotiations. According to his words, all agreements are merely empty words on paper, the U.S.'s military policy cannot be changed, nuclear weapons must never be abolished and must be allowed to be used, and proportional disarmament is absolutely impossible.

    Then, what else is there to talk about? Then, isn't the United States hypocritically participating in disarmament negotiations simply playing a trick?

    In fact, what the United States is playing is not just a trick; it also has other ulterior motives.

    Dulles divides the issues in disarmament negotiations into two categories: On the fundamental issues that must be resolved for genuine disarmament, as mentioned above, he closes the door. But on the other hand, there are some things that he says are "possible to do."

    What are these things on this other side? Dulles listed a total of seven items. In summary, they can be divided into two types: One is superficial concessions that do not affect the U.S.'s continued development of nuclear weapons and preparation for war. For example, temporarily stopping nuclear weapons tests, but the duration of the stop can only be "about ten months," because this is "a period that would not disrupt our (U.S.) existing arrangement of scientific personnel." The other is a deliberate trick aimed at gaining military advantages for the United States in the name of disarmament. For example, he demands supervision of the manufacture of long-range missiles that can launch nuclear weapons, and specifically mentions intercontinental missiles. The meaning is very clear. The United States has established a string of military bases around the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union has not established similar offensive bases around the United States. Thus, prohibiting long-range weapons would be very beneficial to the United States. It can launch aggression at will without worrying about retaliation on its homeland. On the issue of inspection, Dulles proposed to start in the Arctic Circle region, which would include a large and important area of the Soviet Union, while the U.S. homeland and its main military bases surrounding socialist countries would be completely outside. As for the European inspection zone that everyone is concerned about, he said that it would take a much longer time to formulate.

    Dulles's speech further illustrates that the United States has no intention of reaching an agreement in the disarmament negotiations. Since the start of the London negotiations in March of this year, due to the efforts of the Soviet Union and the pressure of world public opinion, the U.S. representative was once forced to pretend to be seriously negotiating. However, the closer it gets to the crucial moment, the more the United States equivocates and evades agreements.

    "It puts forward all sorts of astonishing, but completely unworkable, proposals, trying to make itself look like a 'peace lover.'" This is a sentence that Dulles uses to slander the Soviet Union. In fact, this is the most pertinent self-portrait.

    The people of the world are becoming increasingly impatient with the slow progress of disarmament negotiations. They are also becoming increasingly clear from the specific process of the negotiations who is sincerely seeking an agreement and who is deliberately delaying. A series of pertinent and practical proposals put forward by the Soviet Union have laid a good foundation for a preliminary disarmament agreement, and the eyes of the public are focused on the West. Thus, people see that after colluding with the United States to delay the agreement in various ways, Britain suddenly published a white paper on disarmament a few days ago, touting that the negotiations had made "great progress." Following this, Dulles also delivered this pretentious speech. What is the intention? It is nothing more than wanting to deceive public opinion and shirk responsibility. But the public can see clearly that the real obstacle to disarmament is the closed-door attitude of the West on the key issues of abolishing nuclear weapons, stopping nuclear tests, and reducing armaments, as reflected in Dulles's speech.

    杜勒斯在裁军问题上关门
    本报评论员
    22日，美国国务卿杜勒斯就裁军问题发表了一篇演说。在这篇冗长的演说里，杜勒斯极力为西方在裁军谈判中的拖延策略辩护，并且在几个主要的实质问题上关上了大门。
    首先，杜勒斯再一次重弹美国的“实力地位政策”的老调，并且大肆散布国际不信任的气氛，毫无根据地诬蔑苏联。在这种“冷战”锣鼓的掩护下，杜勒斯宣布了三大“行不通”。第一，仅仅信赖诺言行不通。所以美国“决不完全信赖纸上的诺言而改变我们的军事地位”。第二，保证废止核武器行不通。所以“在制定方案的时候必须假定在战争中将会使用这些武器”。第三，准确地计算双方军力行不通。所以成比例裁减军备不可能。
    大家知道，举行裁军谈判，本来是为了谋求逐步地达成协议，消除国际间的不信任，从而缓和国际紧张局势，结束军备竞赛，实现全面裁军和彻底禁止一切核武器。但是，杜勒斯所表示的美国的基本态度，却等于是一口否定了进行裁军谈判的基础。照他的话说来，一切协议都不过是纸上空文，美国的军备政策不能改变，核武器决不能废除而且要容许使用，成比例裁军绝对办不到。
    那末，还有什么可谈的呢？那末，美国还假惺惺地参加裁军谈判，岂不是在玩弄骗局么？
    其实，美国玩的不仅只是骗局而已，它还另有不可告人的目的。
    杜勒斯把裁军谈判中的问题分为两类：在上述的那些为了真正裁军而必须解决的根本性问题上，他关起了大门。但是另一面也有一些他说是“可能做到的事”。
    这一方面的是那些问题呢？杜勒斯一共列举了七项。归纳起来可以分为两种：一种是不影响美国继续发展核武器和准备战争的表面让步。例如暂时停止核武器试验，但是停止期限只能是“十个月左右”，因为这是“不至于打乱我们（美国）现有的科学人员布置的一段时间”。另一种是以裁军为名，企图使美国取得军事上的利益的别有用心的诡计。例如，他要求监督可以投射核武器的远射程导弹的制造，而且特别提出洲际导弹。这含义很明显。美国在苏联周围建立有成串的军事基地，而苏联并没有到美国周围去同样建立进攻基地。这样禁止了远射程武器，对美国将大有好处。它可以放手发动侵略，而不必担心本土遭到反击。在视察问题上，杜勒斯提出要在北极圈地区开始，这将包括苏联的一大片重要地区，而美国本土和它包围社会主义国家的主要军事基地完全在外。至于大家关心的欧洲视察区，他就说需要长得多的时间来拟订了。
    杜勒斯这一篇谈话，进一步地说明了美国在裁军谈判中是毫无取得协议的意愿的。从今年3月伦敦谈判开始以来，由于苏联的努力和世界舆论的压力，美国代表曾经被迫装出认真谈判的姿态。但是，越到紧要关头，美国就越闪烁其辞，规避协议。
    “它提出各种惊人的、然而却是完全行不通的建议，力图把自己装成一副‘爱好和平’的样子。”这是杜勒斯用来污蔑苏联的一句话。实际上，这是最中肯不过的自我写照。
    全世界的人民对于裁军谈判进展之慢已愈来愈感到不耐烦了。他们从谈判的具体进程中也愈来愈看清楚谁是在真诚谋求协议，而谁又是在故意进行拖延。苏联方面提出的一系列中肯而又切实的建议，已经为裁军的初步协议奠定了良好的基础，公众的目光都注视着西方。于是，人们看到，在同美国勾结一气多方拖延协议之后，英国前几天忽然发表裁军问题白皮书，鼓吹谈判已取得“巨大的进展”。跟着杜勒斯也发表了这篇装腔作势的演说。其用意何在呢？不外是想欺骗舆论，推托责任。但是公众能够看得清楚，裁军的真正障碍，就是杜勒斯的演说所反映的西方在废除核武器、停止核试验和裁减军备这些关键问题上的关门态度。
