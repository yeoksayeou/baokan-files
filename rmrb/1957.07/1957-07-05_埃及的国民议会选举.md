Elections for the National Assembly of Egypt

The first elections for the National Assembly of Egypt were held on July 3rd. This is a major event in the political life of the Egyptian people.

After overthrowing the Farouk dynasty in 1952 and achieving revolutionary victory, Egypt entered a three-year "transitional period" in 1953. During the transitional period, the "Revolutionary Command Council" exercised the functions of parliament. In January of last year, the Egyptian government announced a draft of the new constitution, which was approved by a national referendum held on June 23rd. The new constitution came into effect on that date, and the "transitional period" was declared over.

The new Egyptian constitution stipulates that the National Assembly should be elected by universal suffrage to establish a democratic life. The elections for the National Assembly were originally scheduled for October of last year, but were postponed to this year due to the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion war.

Campaign activities for the National Assembly began in March of this year. According to the election law, any Egyptian citizen who is at least thirty years old, literate, and pays a deposit can participate in the election. However, former members of the royal family, former members of parliament convicted by the 1954 Revolutionary Court, those placed under administrative control by the Ministry of Interior according to the Revolutionary Committee's June 1956 resolution, and those dismissed from government agencies for dishonesty who have not passed five years are not allowed to participate in the election. Those who wish to participate in the election must be reviewed and nominated by the "National Union."

A total of one thousand one hundred and sixty candidates participated in this election. Approximately six million voters, a quarter of the Egyptian population, elected three hundred and fifty members from these candidates by secret ballot.

A feature of this Egyptian election is that women have obtained the right to vote and be elected for the first time in history. Sixteen women applied to participate in the election, five of whom were approved.

According to the constitution, the Egyptian National Assembly adopts a unicameral system. It is the highest national legislative body in Egypt and is re-elected every five years. Every law of the country must be passed by the National Assembly before it takes effect. If the parliament votes no confidence in any minister of the government, the minister should resign immediately. Members of parliament may be appointed as ministers or deputy ministers.

The Egyptian constitution stipulates that the President of the Republic is nominated by the National Assembly and elected by a national vote for a term of six years. Executive power belongs to the President, who has the power to dissolve the National Assembly and hold new parliamentary elections within sixty days. The President has the power to propose, promulgate, or veto laws. However, if the National Assembly passes a law with a two-thirds majority to uphold the original proposal after the President vetoes it, the law will also become law. The National Assembly has the right to impeach the President for violating laws or dereliction of duty upon the proposal of one-third of the members and with the approval of more than two-thirds of the members. During the period of impeachment, the President's duties are performed by the Speaker of the National Assembly.

### 埃及的国民议会选举

    埃及的国民议会选举
    埃及第一届国民议会选举已经在7月3日举行。这是埃及人民政治生活中的一件大事。
    埃及在1952年推翻法鲁克王朝，取得革命胜利后，于1953年起进入为期三年的“过渡时期”。在过渡时期内，由“革命指导委员会”代行议会职权。去年1月埃及政府公布了新宪法草案，并于6月23日举行的全民投票中获得通过。新宪法于是日起生效，“过渡时期”遂宣告结束。
    埃及新宪法规定要由普选产生国民议会，建立民主生活。国民议会的选举原定去年10月间举行，由于英法以发动侵略战争，因而推迟到今年举行。
    国民议会的竞选活动，在今年3月间就开始了。根据选举法规定，凡年满三十岁、能读能写并缴纳保证金的埃及公民都可以参加竞选。但前皇族成员、经1954年革命法庭判决罪行的前议员、根据革命委员会1956年6月决议被内政部置于行政管制的人以及因不诚实遭政府机关开除而未过五年的人都不得参加竞选。要求参加竞选的人，须经过“民族联盟”审查提名。
    这次参加竞选的候选人共一千一百六十人。占埃及人口四分之一的大约六百万选民从这些候选人中以秘密投票方式选出三百五十名议员。
    埃及这次选举的一个特点，是妇女在历史上第一次获得了选举权和被选举权。有十六位妇女申请参加竞选，其中五位获得批准。
    根据宪法规定，埃及国民议会实行一院制，它是埃及最高的国家立法机关，五年改选一次。国家的每一条法律都必须经国民议会通过以后才生效。议会对政府的任何部长投不信任票后，该部长应即辞职。议员得被任命为部长或副部长。
    埃及宪法规定，共和国总统由国民议会提名，经全国选民投票选出，任期六年。行政权属于总统，总统有权解散国民议会，并在六十天内举行新的议会选举。总统有权建议、颁布或否决法律。但总统在否决一法案后，如国民议会三分之二的多数通过维持原案，则该法案亦将成为法律。国民议会经三分之一议员提议，并经三分之二以上议员赞成，有权弹劾违法失职的总统。在被弹劾期间，总统职务由国民议会议长代行。
