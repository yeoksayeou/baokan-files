Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee said that agricultural production cooperatives across the country have achieved further success in the past six months. Agricultural cooperatives are more consolidated than before, and their superiority has been further developed.

As a result of the further development of the agricultural cooperative movement this spring, the number of farmer households participating in advanced cooperatives now accounts for 93.3% of the total number of farmer households, and the number of farmer households participating in elementary cooperatives accounts for 3.7%. Combined, the total number of farmer households participating in cooperatives nationwide has reached 97%. These participating farmer households have formed a total of 752,113 cooperatives, of which 668,081 are advanced cooperatives. Averaging both advanced and elementary cooperatives, each cooperative has 158.1 households.

Looking back, the agricultural cooperative movement has progressed rapidly. Since the movement entered its climax in the second half of 1955, elementary cooperation was achieved nationwide in early 1956, followed by the realization of advanced cooperation in most provinces and regions. This spring, the remaining provinces and regions also achieved advanced cooperation. Last winter and this spring, cooperatives in various regions also carried out rectification based on the principles of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, and solved some problems to varying degrees. During this period, some farmers in various places withdrew from the cooperatives due to reduced income last year or other reasons. Most of them were upper-middle peasants who had higher incomes before joining the cooperatives, as well as some poor and lower-middle peasants with fewer laborers and more children, and non-agricultural laborers. However, after the agricultural cooperatives were rectified and various unreasonable phenomena were corrected, many farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperatives voluntarily rejoined, and many individual farmers, seeing the undeniable superiority of agricultural cooperatives in increasing production, joined one after another. Last winter and this spring, a very small number of farmers across the country did withdraw from the cooperatives, but the number of new members was even greater. The percentage of farmer households participating in cooperatives nationwide rose from a little less than 92% last spring to 97% this spring. This shows the success of the cooperative movement and the widespread trust of farmers in agricultural cooperatives.

In the past six months, the main progress of the agricultural cooperative movement has been primarily manifested in the preliminary implementation of the principle of democratic management of cooperatives. The erroneous practices of cadres not consulting with the masses and not absorbing the experience of experienced farmers in production arrangements, technological improvements, etc., have been greatly changed. The shortcomings of not being able to disclose financial information on time are also being gradually improved. Cadres who had been detached from production labor have generally returned to production labor, thereby strengthening the relationship between cooperative cadres and members and promoting democracy. Secondly, there have been many mass initiatives and accumulated experiences in the work of running cooperatives in various places, enabling the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives to begin to get on track. A major advance in operation and management is the relatively sound system of contracting production to teams and groups. The advanced experience of "contracting production to teams, contracting labor to groups, and contracting field management to households" has been promoted in many places. In this way, the production responsibility system (including collective responsibility system and individual responsibility system), which is indispensable to the collective economy, has become relatively sound. Under the unified planning and arrangement of the cooperative, the flexibility of production teams has been increased, the role of production teams in production has been further developed, and errors of detachment from reality have been reduced; the implementation of the method of setting production targets slightly lower than planned targets has greatly increased the enthusiasm of production teams and members. In this way, the agricultural cooperative has found the correct direction for organizing production and labor, which is "unified management, decentralized management, clear division of labor, and individual responsibility," which can further improve labor efficiency, enable greater use of auxiliary labor, and further develop the advantages of rational land use and the promotion of advanced technology. In addition, some excessively large cooperatives have been appropriately reduced in size, and draft animals that do not have the conditions for centralized feeding have also been distributed to households for feeding, which has played a positive role in consolidating the cooperatives.

The person in charge pointed out that comprehensively developing production, meeting the needs of all aspects of the national economy as much as possible, and ensuring that the majority of farmers increase their income are the basic tasks of agricultural cooperatives and where the superiority of the cooperatives lies. This year, the area planted with early rice in the south has slightly increased compared to last year, and generally, it is growing well; the autumn harvest crops in the north and various cash crops across the country are also growing well. Currently, cooperative members are strengthening field management and actively fighting against natural disasters to strive for a bumper harvest; the more than 370 million mu of wheat across the country has been basically harvested. According to reports from various places, the estimated total output will increase by 700 million jin compared to last year. At the same time, sideline production and diversified operations in various places have also developed accordingly. Increased income from sideline occupations is a relatively common phenomenon in agricultural cooperatives across the country. One of the main sideline occupations in China's rural areas - pig raising - has developed rapidly. According to statistics, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the total number of pigs raised nationwide had reached 97 million, and in June it had already exceeded 100 million. In addition, farmers in disaster areas in Henan Province have not only planted crops in a timely manner but have also carried out various sideline production activities. Last winter and this spring, the province's total sideline income reached more than 100 million yuan, and 30% of the disaster victims relied on sideline income to overcome their living difficulties.

During the high tide of the cooperative movement last year, grain production developed, but due to such rapid and fierce production reorganization and shortcomings in the work, the development of certain sideline production activities was once affected last spring. Attention began to be paid to the development of sideline occupations in the second half of last year, and now sideline occupations in agricultural cooperatives across the country have gradually developed in an all-round way, especially the rapid development of pig raising. This fully proves that as long as the new socialist system becomes consolidated, the speed of production development will quickly surpass that of the individual economy era.

The person in charge of the Rural Work Department also said that the further consolidation of cooperatives and the further development of their superiority in production do not mean that there are no problems. Rather, it means that past problems can be solved, and as long as we continue to accumulate experience, further implement the principle of democratic management of cooperatives on the existing basis, further improve operation and management, and further resolve various contradictions between the state and cooperatives, within cooperatives, and between cooperatives, the cooperatives will be fundamentally consolidated in five years or a little longer, and will fully demonstrate their superiority in all aspects.

    赏给右派分子的又一记响亮“耳光”
    农业社更巩固  优越性更发挥
    中共中央农村工作部负责人综述半年来合作化的成绩
    据新华社4日讯　中共中央农村工作部负责人说，半年来全国农业生产合作社进一步取得了成绩。农业社比前巩固了，优越性发挥得更多了。
    今年春天农业合作化运动进一步发展的结果，现在全国参加高级社的农户已占总农户的93.3％，参加初级社的农户占3.7％。两项合计，全国入社农户已达97％。这些入社的农户，共计组成了七十五万二千一百一十三个社，其中高级社有六十六万八千零八十一个。高、初级两类合作社平均，每社有一百五十八点一户。
    回顾一下，农业合作化运动的前进是很快的。从1955年下半年运动进入高潮以来，1956年初全国就实现了初级合作化，接着多数省区实现了高级合作化。今春其余的省区又实现了高级合作化。去冬今春，各地的合作社还根据勤俭办社和民主办社的方针进行了整顿，程度不同地解决了一些问题。这中间，各地都有一些农民因去年减少了收入或其他原因退社，他们大多数是入社前收入较高的上中农，也有一部分劳力少子女多的贫农下中农和非农业劳动者。但在农业社经过整顿，纠正各种不够合理的现象之后，许多退社农民又自动回了社，还有许多单干农民见农业社确有增产的优越性，纷纷参加。去冬今春，全国确实有极少数农民退社，但是新加入的更多。全国入社农户的百分比，去年春天是92％弱，今年春天上升到97％。这说明：合作化运动的成功，广大农民对农业社的信任。
    半年来，农业合作化运动的主要进展，首先表现在民主办社方针的已初步贯彻，干部对生产布置、技术改进等等，不同群众商量，不吸收老农经验的错误做法已经有很大的改变；财务不能按时公开的缺点也正在逐步改进中。脱离生产劳动的社干部普遍回到了生产劳动中去，从而社干部和社员关系密切了，民主发扬了。其次，各地办社工作中间都有许多群众性的创造，积累了许多经验，使农业社的经营管理开始走上了轨道。经营管理上的一个重大进展，就是包工包产的制度比较健全了。“产包到队，工包到组，田间管理包到户”这一类的先进经验在许多地方推广了。这样，集体经济所不可缺少的生产责任制（包括集体责任制和个人责任制）就比较健全起来了。在合作社的统一计划和安排下，生产队的机动权力加大了，生产队在生产上的作用进一步发挥了，脱离实际的错误减少了；实行包产指标略低于计划指标的办法，又大大提高了生产队和社员的积极性。这样，农业社就找到了“统一经营、分级管理、明确分工、个人负责”这样一个组织生产和组织劳动的正确方向，劳动效率能够进一步提高，辅助劳力也能够更多的利用，同时更进一步发挥了合理利用土地和推广先进技术的优越性。此外，某些规模过大的合作社适当地划小了，耕畜没有条件集中喂养的也分散到户喂养了，这对合作社的巩固都起了积极的作用。
    这位负责人指出，全面发展生产，尽可能地满足国民经济各方面的需要，保证大多数农民增加收入，这是农业社的基本任务，也是合作社优越性所在。今年，南方种植的早稻面积，比去年略有增加，目前一般生长还好；北方的秋收作物和全国的各种经济作物也长的不错，当前社员们正在加强田间管理，积极同自然灾害作斗争，争取丰收；全国三亿七千多万亩小麦已经基本收完，据各地报告，预计总产量比去年增加七亿斤。同时，各地的副业生产和多种经营，也有了相应的发展，副业收入增加是全国农业社比较普遍的现象。我国农村的一项主要副业——养猪业就发展得很快，据统计，今年第一季度末，全国养猪总头数已达九千七百万头，6月间已经突破一亿头。另外河南省灾区农民，不仅适时地种上了地，还开展了多种副业生产，去冬今春全省副业收入共达一亿多元，有30％的灾民依靠副业收入克服了生活困难。
    去年合作化运动高潮中，粮食生产发展了，但由于这样迅速和猛烈的生产改组，由于工作上的缺点，某些副业生产的发展在去春曾一度受到影响。去年下半年开始注意发展副业，现在全国农业社的副业已逐渐全面发展，特别是养猪业的迅速发展，这就充分证明了，只要新的社会主义制度走向巩固，生产发展的速度便很快超过了个体经济时代。
    农村工作部负责人还说，合作社更趋巩固和生产上的优越性有了进一步的发挥，并不是说没有问题了。而是说，过去的问题既能解决，今后只要继续积累经验，在现有的基础上进一步贯彻民主办社的方针，进一步改进经营管理，进一步解决国家同合作社、合作社内部、社和社之间的各种矛盾，在五年之后或者更长一点的时间，合作社一定会从根本上巩固下来，充分发挥它在各方面的优越性。
