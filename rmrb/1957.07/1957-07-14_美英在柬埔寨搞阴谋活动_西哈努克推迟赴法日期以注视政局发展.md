Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 13th: According to a report in the "Cambodia Current Situation" weekly today, Prince Sihanouk, who resigned from his position as Prime Minister on June 21st, has decided to postpone his trip to France in order to monitor the development of the domestic political situation. Sihanouk was originally scheduled to go to France for medical treatment after July 15th.

The "Cambodia Current Situation" weekly stated that certain foreign countries are supporting some people in Cambodia who are pursuing power and money. The conspiracy activities carried out by these countries to undermine Cambodia's peaceful and neutral policy are the real cause of the current cabinet crisis in Cambodia.

Cambodian newspapers have recently repeatedly accused the United States and the United Kingdom of doing their utmost to attack Sihanouk in order to undermine his policy of peace and neutrality.

    美英在柬埔寨搞阴谋活动
    西哈努克推迟赴法日期以注视政局发展
    据新华社金边13日电　据“柬埔寨现状”周刊今天报道，在6月21日辞去首相职务的西哈努克亲王已经决定推迟前往法国的日期，以注视国内政治局势的发展。西哈努克原定在7月15日以后前往法国就医。
    “柬埔寨现状”周刊说，某些外国支持柬埔寨的一些追求权位和金钱的人士。这些国家为破坏柬埔寨的和平中立政策所进行的阴谋活动，是柬埔寨目前内阁危机的真正原因。
    柬埔寨报纸最近曾经不断指责美国和英国竭力攻击西哈努克以破坏他所奉行的和平中立政策。
