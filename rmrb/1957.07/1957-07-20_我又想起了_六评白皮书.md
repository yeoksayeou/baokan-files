I Remember the "Six Commentaries on the White Paper" Again
Xiang Chong, Associate Professor, Renmin University of China

When Situ Lei Deng (Stuart) hurriedly left Nanjing and had not yet arrived in Washington after the national liberation in 1949, the U.S. State Department published a notorious White Paper that reversed the facts of more than 100 years of U.S. imperialist aggression against China and wantonly slandered the Chinese people and the great War of Liberation.

At that time, I was in Shanghai. I remember studying the "Six Commentaries on the White Paper" published by Xinhua News Agency with my comrades, and I also participated in one or two discussion meetings. During the study process, what impressed me most was that after being forced to admit that the Communist Party had won the support of the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism had to pin its hopes on China's "democratic individualists" and encourage them to carry out all activities aimed at overthrowing the new China.

Eight years have passed swiftly, and I have gained some knowledge from eight years of study. Through the education and help of the Party, participation in a series of political movements such as land reform, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, and the systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory, most intellectuals have preliminarily changed their positions and viewpoints to varying degrees. Especially after the policy on intellectuals and the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" were put forward, everyone's excitement and encouragement were self-evident. We are willing to contribute a little to the great socialist construction process, we are willing to use our limited level of Marxist-Leninist theory to analyze and criticize what we learned in the past, and we are willing to exert our potential as much as possible in the march towards science.

After the Party's rectification campaign was launched on the basis of correctly handling contradictions among the people, the opinions put forward by the vast majority of intellectuals to the Party organization were sincere and well-intentioned. Although some places may not be correct, it is understandable that the general public is more likely to examine problems from a partial situation and current interests and find it difficult to understand the entire situation and all the difficulties. In the process of making suggestions to the Party, for many people, it is indeed a process of ideological training to "speak out freely and exhaustively" from the habits of "not being willing to meddle in other people's business" and "being embarrassed" that were instilled in the old society. Many comrades are happy to help the Party "eliminate the three evils" and hope that the rectification campaign can enable the schools they serve to overcome shortcomings and move forward.

This method of open-door rectification, which inspires the masses to "say everything they know and say it without reservation," is precisely where the greatness of the Party lies. The Party dares to face up to its shortcomings and is determined to correct them, which also shows that a political party that serves the people wholeheartedly is selfless.

However, in the process of rectification, a countercurrent of anti-Party and anti-socialist road also appeared. This countercurrent came from all directions, and after reactionary remarks appeared in the unit I served, I felt harsh, but I did not immediately come forward to counterattack. My concern was: Would the counterattack hinder the enthusiasm of the masses for making suggestions? Would the anti-criticism hinder the normal progress of "eliminating the three evils"? It was not until I saw in the newspaper that some people had received anonymous threatening letters because they had different opinions from others that I realized that the situation at that time was not simple. When our great enemy is in front of us, we should rise up in response. We are diligently helping the Party to rectify the style of work in order to build the socialist cause better and faster, but if someone openly expresses that they want to "kill the communists," and someone uses flowery words to overthrow the leadership of the Party or weaken the leadership of the Party, then what is our hard work for?

With the exposure of a series of reactionary words and deeds by right-wing ambitious elements such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, I actively participated in the ranks of the anti-Rightist struggle with a very angry mood. These people were originally politicians and bureaucrats of the old society. If they had "ambitions" in politics, their "ambitions" were for bourgeois democracy rather than the socialist road. Since liberation, the Party and the government have given them important responsibilities, and in any respect, it can be said that they have done everything they can, but they are still full of complaints and have consistently expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Party. After the policy on intellectuals was put forward, they hoped to use intellectuals as their political capital; after the principles of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools contend," and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" were put forward, they became ambitious, thinking that from then on, there was much to be done. The occurrence of the Hungarian incident last year strengthened their illusions; the conduct of the Party organization's rectification campaign this year made those who called themselves opportunists think that the best "opportunity" had arrived, and they launched a frenzied attack on the socialist system and the leadership of the Party in various open and hidden ways. No wonder that on June 6, at the symposium held in the name of Zhang Bojun at the Cultural Club, Zhang Bojun even blushed and waved his fists, thinking that their "good times" were coming.

What does all this illustrate? Old memories are still fresh, and the "Six Commentaries on the White Paper" that I studied eight years ago can't help but come to my mind again! The materials at hand have been scattered, and after seeing a passage from Xinhua News Agency's analysis of Chapter 6 of the White Paper, I was even more shocked. The original text of this passage is as follows:

"On August 19, 1947, Stuart made a conclusion on the policy toward China. He wrote: 'To establish the 'capable political leadership' of Nationalist China, so that this anti-people government 'can regain control of intellectuals and the masses.' Stuart... openly called for the organization of a new party, to appear as a third party, and attempted to organize an anti-communist faction within the Chinese democratic camp."

"Those close to us are saddened, and those who hate us are pleased," these are by no means two ordinary old sayings. The fact is: what we hate today is exactly what our enemies expect. For many years, imperialist countries have run schools and "cultivated" overseas students in China, with the aim of training a group of "democratic individualists," vainly attempting to "transform the world according to the image of the Western bourgeoisie" through them. Although the new China has stood up and shattered the illusions of imperialism, and although most of the intellectuals who were once "democratic individualists" have united around the Communist Party, as long as the imperialists exist for a day, their hearts will never die. It is hateful that even after eight years since liberation, a very small number of intellectual scum still want to go backwards, and still want to go against the wishes of the people to cater to the intentions of imperialism.

The subjective wish of right-wing ambitious elements to go backwards did not arise in the face of today's situation, but has its own historical origin. Zhang Bojun, regarding Marshall's statement that China's "demise" would not be "due to" the Communist Party but "due to" the China Democratic League, proudly added an annotation saying: "...The Democratic League at that time gave the United States the illusion that China's third force could take the capitalist democratic road and would not follow in the footsteps of the Soviet Union. Because of this illusion, the United States relaxed its supply of military power, and as a result, it was greatly fooled, and Chiang Kai-shek quickly collapsed." Luo Longji even claimed that the United States "would have been much better off giving one-tenth of the money given to Chiang Kai-shek to the Democratic League." Don't these words echo the imperialist elements?

In recent years, I have devoted myself to teaching and research with great interest, and spent less time on social activities, so my political sensitivity has been very slow, and it is difficult for me to distinguish between right and wrong in the false and true, true and false statements of the rightists, and in some places, I have even lost my way. After reading the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao for dividing the line between us and the words and deeds of the rightists, I feel that this is a ideological weapon to guide us in the right direction. However, the correct direction requires us to move forward with conscious effort, and weapons must be applied through participation in extremely complex and extremely sharp ideological and political struggles, otherwise, the workers have spoken, the peasants have spoken, where is my "knowledge"?

I feel that the death knell of the capitalist system is capital, and the "knowledge" of intellectuals who have not been reformed well is a high wall. But this does not mean that the high wall is the death knell. If we can stand out from the warm flower room and resolutely draw a line with the rightists, and temper ourselves in the environment of struggle, we have a bright future. And the imperialist elements on the other side of the Atlantic can never use the "corpse" of a few right-wing ambitious elements to return their "soul"!

I feel even more that this anti-Rightist struggle is a profound lesson for me. I, who have been educated by the bourgeoisie for a long time, should never subjectively judge that the ideological reform of intellectuals has made great achievements, and therefore, my position has been firmly established, but I should continue to strengthen the transformation continuously. I must sincerely thank the Party for giving me a heavy pat on the shoulder, so that I can realize that the struggle against the Rightists is a struggle between two roads, so that I will not blindly go into a "dead end."

I feel even more that opening the door from the narrow study, although a little dizzy, after taking a closer look, this is really not the season of "sudden warm and cold, the most difficult to rest," but a sunny day of great spring!

### 我又想起了“六评白皮书”

    我又想起了“六评白皮书”
    中国人民大学副教授  项冲
    当1949年全国解放后不久，司徒雷登狼狈离开南京而还未到达华盛顿的时候，美国国务院曾经发表一篇臭名昭著的白皮书，把一百多年来美帝国主义侵略中国的史实颠倒黑白地加以叙述，同时肆意诬蔑中国人民和伟大的解放战争。
    那时我在上海。我还记得当时对新华社发表的“六评白皮书”和同志们一块儿学习过，并且参加过一、二次座谈会。在学习过程中，对我印象特别深刻的，便是美帝国主义在被迫承认共产党获得中国人民的拥护之余，不得不把希望寄托于中国的“民主的个人主义者”身上，并且要鼓励他们进行推翻新中国为目的的一切活动。
    八年来的流光如矢，八年来学习的收获也多少有一些。通过党的教育和帮助，参加了一系列土改、三反和肃反等政治运动，以及有系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论，大部分的知识分子都在不同程度上初步改变了立场和观点。尤其是知识分子政策和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出来以后，大家的兴奋鼓舞是不言而喻的。我们愿意在伟大的社会主义建设过程中尽一点小小的力量，我们愿意用有限的马列主义理论水平来分析和批判旧日所学习的东西，我们也愿意在向科学进军声中尽可能发挥自己的潜力。
    在正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针的基础上展开党的整风以后，绝大部分知识分子对党组织所提的意见是诚恳而出于善意的。尽管有些地方不见得正确，但是由于一般群众所处的地位，比较容易从局部情况和当前利益去考察问题而难于了解全部情况和全部困难，不确切和错误之处应当可以理解。而在向党提意见过程中，对不少人来说，从平素不大愿意管“闲事”和旧社会所熏染下的“不好意思”的习惯来“鸣”和“放”，确实也是思想锻炼的过程。许多同志们都乐于帮助党“除三害”，希望通过整风能够使所服务的学校克服缺点并向前推进一步。
    这种启发群众“知无不言、言无不尽”的开门整风方法，正是党的伟大之处。党是敢于正视缺点而有决心改正缺点，而这也正表示全心全意为人民服务的政党是大公无私的。
    然而，在整风过程中也出现了一股反党、反社会主义道路的逆流。这股逆流是来自四面八方的，而在我所服务的单位中出现了反动言论以后，我虽则感到刺耳，但是没有立刻出面反击。我的顾虑是：反击会不会引起群众提意见的积极性受到阻碍？反批评会不会有碍于“除三害”的正常进行？直到报上发表某些人因为与别人有不同的意见而收到匿名恐吓信时，我才觉悟到当时的情况并不简单。我们的大敌临前，就应当应声而起。我们勤勤恳恳地帮助党整风是为了更好更快地建设社会主义事业，而有人明目张胆地表示要“杀共产党人”，有人花言巧语地要推翻党的领导或削弱党的领导，那末我们的辛勤劳动，究竟是为了什么？
    随着章伯钧和罗隆基等右派野心分子一系列的反动言行揭开以后，我以十分愤怒的心情积极地参加了反右派斗争的行列。这些人原是旧社会的政客和官僚。如果说他们在政治上有“抱负”的话，他们的“抱负”是资产阶级的民主而不是社会主义的道路。解放以来，党和政府给予他们以重任，在任何一方面来讲可以说都已经仁至义尽，可是他们还是满腹牢骚，一贯地对党表示极端不满。知识分子政策提出来以后，他们希望利用知识分子来作他们的政治资本；“百花齐放、百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出来以后，他们就野心勃勃，认为从此以后，大有可为了。去年匈牙利事件的发生加强了他们的幻想；今年党组织整风的进行更使自称为机会主义者的分子认为最好的“机会”已经到来，用种种公开的和隐藏的方式向社会主义制度和党的领导作猖狂的进攻。这难怪在6月6日那一天，以章伯钧个人名义在文化俱乐部所召开的谈话会上，章伯钧竟至胀红了脸，挥动拳头，以为他们的“好时光”就要到来了。
    这一切说明了什么？旧忆犹新，八年前所学习的“六评白皮书”不禁又涌上我的心头！手头的材料已经东抛西失，在看到新华社对白皮书第六章的解剖中的一段话以后，更使我触目惊心。这一段话的原文如下：
    “1947年8月19日司徒雷登作出了对华政策的结论。他写着：要建立国民党中国的‘有能力的政治领导’，使这个反人民政府‘能恢复把握住知识分子和群众’。司徒雷登……公开号召组织新党，以第三者的面目出现，并妄图在中国民主阵营内部组织反共派别。”
    “亲者所痛，仇者所快”，这决不是两句平常的老话。事实就是如此：我们在今天所痛恨的，正是我们的敌人所期望的。多少年来，帝国主义国家在中国开办学校和“培养”留学生，目的就在于训练出一批“民主的个人主义”者，妄想通过他们按照“西方资产阶级自己的面貌来改造世界”。尽管新中国站起来以后粉碎了帝国主义的幻想，尽管大部分曾经是“民主的个人主义者”的知识分子已团结在共产党的周围，可是只要帝国主义者存在着一天，他们的心永远是不死的。可恨的是：解放后已经八年，却有一极小部分的知识分子败类还要走回头路，还要去违背人民的愿望来迎合帝国主义的意图。
    右派野心分子走回头路的主观愿望不是面临着今天的形势才发生的，而自有它的历史上的渊源。章伯钧对于马歇尔所说中国之“亡”不“亡”于共产党而“亡”于中国民主同盟一句话，得意忘形地自加注疏说道：“……民盟在当时给美国一种错觉，中国的第三种力量可以走资本主义的民主道路，不会步苏联后尘。由于这种错觉，美国就放松了军事力量的补充，结果上了大当，弄得蒋介石很快垮台。”罗隆基更声称美国“如果把给蒋介石的钱的十分之一拿给民盟会要好得多”。这种话，难道不和帝国主义分子同声相应么？
    年来自己致力于教学与研究的兴趣很浓，而从事于社会活动的时间较少，因此对于政治的敏感性，就显得十分迟钝，对于右派分子虚虚实实、实实虚虚的言论，就难以明辨是非，有的地方甚至使自己迷失了方向。读了毛主席所提出和右派言行划分界限的六条标准以后，觉得这是引导我们走入正确方向的思想武器。但是，正确方向要我们用自觉的努力往前走，而武器必须通过参加极复杂而极尖锐的思想和政治斗争才能应用，不然的话，工人说话了，农民说话了，我的“知识”又在哪里呢？
    我觉得：资本主义制度的丧钟就是资本，而未经改造好的知识分子的“知识”却是一座高墙。但这决不是说：高墙就是丧钟。如果我们能够从温暖的花室站出来，坚决地和右派分子划分界限，从斗争的环境中锻炼自己，我们是有一片锦绣前程的。而大西洋彼岸的帝国主义分子们决不可能借少数右派野心分子的“尸”来还他们的“魂”！
    我更觉得：这次反右派斗争对我来说是一番深刻的教训，长期受过资产阶级教育的我，决不应该主观地判断知识分子的思想改造已经获得很大的成绩，因而，立场已经站稳了，而应当继续不断加强改造。我得衷心感谢党对我重重地拍了一下肩膀，使我体会到对右派的斗争就是两条道路的斗争，使我不会迷惘地走入“死胡同”。
    我更觉得：从狭隘的书房里开了房门，尽管有些眼花缭乱，定神一看，这真不是“乍暖还寒，最难将息”的时节，而是一个大好春光的艳阳天！
