Is Britain Retreading the Old Path of "Appeasement Policy"?
    Hu Ping

    Western news agencies recently revealed a secret plan being drafted by Britain and West Germany. According to this plan, Britain and West Germany will conduct "close cooperation" in military science research, jointly develop and manufacture missiles, rockets and other long-range weapons. In addition, West Germany will order a large amount of munitions from Britain. The matter has been proceeding quietly for several months. The defense ministers of the two countries reached an agreement in principle on "cooperation" in May, and subsequently formed several committees of experts to conduct specific planning. Now, the two countries are preparing to hold high-level meetings to finalize the plan and establish a joint guidance body.

    Britain's collusion with West Germany is another risky step taken by the Conservative government since the Suez crisis, and will seriously affect Britain's fate.

    Since the implementation of the Paris Agreements, West German militarist forces have become increasingly rampant. With the support of the United States, it is stepping up the reconstruction of the Hitler Wehrmacht, expanding military production, and even demanding to possess atomic weapons. It also stubbornly refuses to restore German unity through consultations between the people of East and West Germany, and acts as a henchman for the United States on the issue of disarmament. Some West German fascist groups even openly clamor for war, claiming that they will use force to change the post-war borders of Europe. These facts show that the revived West German militarist forces pose an increasing threat to peace and security in Europe and the world.

    As one of the signatories of the Potsdam Agreement, Britain has a responsibility, together with other relevant countries, to ensure the elimination of West German militarist forces and to make Germany a peaceful, democratic and unified country. However, for its own ulterior motives, Britain has taken the opposite path. Now, Britain is further planning to cooperate with West Germany in a way that suits its tastes, which will add wings to West German militarists.

    The danger involved in this approach is illustrated by precedent. In the 1930s, Britain vigorously supported Hitler in an attempt to make him a pioneer of the anti-Soviet war, but the result was Dunkirk. In the years after the war, Britain's policy of following the United States in supporting West Germany has created a situation very unfavorable to Britain. Britain's international trade is being squeezed, and its position in Western Europe is being seriously challenged by West Germany.

    However, the British Conservative government seems to have a very unrealistic plan to once again use compromise to ease contradictions, and to use British-West German "cooperation" to enhance Britain's position. According to 10 Downing Street's wishful thinking, through this "cooperation," Britain can both use West Germany's technological strength, intervene in some of West Germany's important military production, and find a way out for Britain's arms industry. At the same time, it is also a way to weaken the "Washington-Bonn axis." However, on the Adenauer group's side, it is only because it is still in its infancy, eager to expand its military, and facing the difficult September election, so it is very happy to receive this support from Britain. Once West Germany's strength grows, then Britain will undoubtedly be one of its main targets.

    The current British government's policy toward West Germany is essentially no different from Chamberlain's "appeasement" policy toward the Nazis in the past, but it contains far more serious dangers. "Lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet" - the old play is being repeated.

    英国要重走“绥靖政策”的老道吗？
    胡平
    西方通讯社最近透露了英国和西德正在拟订的一个秘密计划。根据这个计划，英国和西德将在军事科学研究方面进行“紧密合作”，共同发展和制造导弹、火箭和其他远射程武器，另外西德还将向英国订购大宗的军火。事情已经不声不响地进行几个月了。两国的国防部长在5月间就在“合作”的原则上达成了协议，随后又组成了几个专家委员会进行具体的策划。现在，两国已在准备举行较高级的会议来确定计划，并且建立联合指导机构。
    英国对西德这一勾结，是保守党政府从苏伊士事件以来所采取的又一个冒险步骤，将严重地影响英国的命运。
    自从巴黎协定付诸实施以来，西德军国主义势力日益嚣张。它在美国扶助下加紧重建希特勒国防军，扩大军事生产，甚至要求拥有原子武器。它又横蛮地拒绝通过东西德人民的协商来恢复德国的统一，并在裁军问题上充当美国的打手。一些西德的法西斯团体甚至公开叫喊战争，声称要用武力来改变战后欧洲的疆界。这些事实说明了，复活起来的西德军国主义势力对于欧洲以至世界和平和安全的威胁日益增加。
    英国作为波茨坦协定的签字国之一，它本来有责任同其他有关国家一道，保证肃清西德的军国主义势力，使德国成为一个和平民主的统一的国家。可是，为了它的不可告人的目的，英国却走了一条相反的道路。现在，英国又进一步地策划和西德进行投其所好的合作，这将更为西德的军国主义分子添翼了。
    这种做法所包含的危险，是有先例可以说明的。在三十年代，英国曾经大力扶植希特勒，企图要他充当反苏战争的先锋，然而结果是敦克尔克。战后这些年，英国追随美国扶植西德的政策，已经造成了对英国很不利的局面。英国的国际贸易受到排挤，它在西欧的地位受到西德的严重挑战。
    但是，英国的保守党政府似乎有一种非常不现实的打算，想再一次用妥协来缓和矛盾，并利用英国和西德的“合作”，来增强英国的地位。按照唐宁街十号的如意算盘，通过这种“合作”，英国既可以利用西德的技术力量，又可以干预西德的一部分重要的军事生产，并且为英国的军火工业找一点出路。这同时也是一种削弱“华盛顿—波恩轴心”的方法。但是在阿登纳集团方面，它不过是因为自己羽毛未丰、而扩军心切，并且面临着9月选举难关，所以也十分乐于得到英国的这种支持。一旦西德力量长大，那时候，英国无疑会是它的一个主要打击目标。
    英国现政府对西德的这种政策，同过去张伯伦对纳粹的“绥靖”政策，在实质上是毫无二致的，却包含远为严重的危险。“搬起石头打自己的脚”——老戏又在重演了。
