Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: Under pressure from the American press, Secretary of State Dulles stated on the 18th that he would agree to allow a "limited number" of American journalists to visit China for a six-month "trial" period, but he did not agree to completely lift the ban on American journalists visiting China.

Dulles made this statement during a meeting with five representatives of the American press. The participants included Dwight, Chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, Herlihy, President of the Radio and Television News Directors Association, Wiggins, Vice President of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Copple, President of the Radio and Television News Directors Association, and Luce, Editor-in-Chief of "Life" magazine.

Prior to this, the 35th annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, held in San Francisco, had passed a "Declaration of Principles" on July 12, demanding the freedom to report news without government obstruction. According to a survey conducted by the "San Francisco News" among the participants, 92% of them advocated that the State Department lift the ban on journalists visiting China. After the annual meeting passed the above-mentioned "Declaration of Principles," the State Department was forced to issue an invitation to hold this meeting on the same day.

Dulles did not specify exactly how many journalists he meant by "limited number." He explained why he was unwilling to completely lift the ban, saying that he feared that doing so would cause "everyone to flood into China."

Dwight said that the American press opposed restricting the number of journalists or news organizations going to China, and they demanded a complete lifting of the ban. Herlihy said that all the American press representatives present reiterated this position, that American journalists should enjoy complete freedom to go to China.

Because Dulles's views on this issue differed from those of the American press, the State Department said it would further study the issue.

### 杜勒斯把铁幕揭开一条小缝  同意让“数量有限”记者访华

    杜勒斯把铁幕揭开一条小缝
    同意让“数量有限”记者访华
    新华社19日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在美国新闻界的压力下在18日表示，他同意让一批“数量有限”的美国记者到中国作为期六个月的“试行”采访，但是不同意完全取消不让美国记者访问中国的禁令。
    杜勒斯是在同美国报界五名代表举行会议时表示这个态度的。参加会议的有美国报纸出版商协会主席德怀特、美国电台和电视记者协会主席赫尔莱、美国报纸编辑协会副主席维金斯、广播台和电视台新闻部主任协会主席科普和“生活”杂志总编辑卢斯。
    在这以前，在旧金山举行的美国报纸编辑协会第三十五届年会曾经在7月12日通过一项“原则宣言”，要求有不受政府阻挠而采访新闻的自由。据“旧金山新闻”向与会者征询意见的结果，92％的人都主张国务院取消阻挠记者访华的禁令。在年会通过上述“原则宣言”后，国务院在当天就被迫发出了举行这次会议的邀请。
    杜勒斯没有具体说明所谓“数量有限”的记者到底是多少人。他在解释为什么他不肯完全取消禁令时说，这是因为他害怕这样做将会使“所有的人都涌到中国去”。
    德怀特说，美国报界反对限制到中国去的记者人数或者新闻机构，它们要求完全取消禁令。赫尔莱说，所有到会的美国报界代表都重申这个态度，就是美国记者应该享有到中国去的完全自由。
    由于杜勒斯在这个问题上的意见同美国报界有分歧，国务院说要进一步研究这个问题。
