I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and all other reports of the conference.

Now I would like to express some opinions on agricultural cooperativization and the living conditions of farmers. Recently, I saw in the newspapers that some people, under the guise of helping the Party with rectification, launched a frenzied attack on the Party, saying that "agricultural cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale system have messed things up" and "farmers are living too hard," etc. I don't know what position these people are taking or what their basis is. I think it would be best to ask them to look at the facts in the countryside and see the changes that have taken place in the countryside in recent years. I am a farmer. Before liberation, we lived a life worse than cattle. Natural disasters and man-made calamities were too numerous to recount. After a year of hard work, the little grain we harvested was not enough to pay rent to the landlord. If we couldn't pay the rent, we had to work for him for free, carrying water, cooking, carrying sedan chairs, and everything else. Whether it was the busy or slack season, we couldn't get away from the Kuomintang's military service. Once gone, we would be away for days and nights. Many people couldn't bear it and pretended to be cripples, tricking them into beating them into cripples so they could go back. The Baojia chief assigned funds specifically to poor people, and conscripting husbands and catching soldiers was a matter of constant worry. Chen Dongcheng from Huanggang County fled to our Xishui County to avoid conscription, but was still caught. He ran back to Huanggang County secretly after the Japanese surrendered, but not long after, the Kuomintang fought the civil war and wanted to draft him again. He was so scared that he secretly ran back to Huanggang County again. His mother went around saying he was dead, held a Buddhist service for him, and cried for more than half a year. Two years later, he didn't escape until liberation. "No matter how hard life is, not sending military service, not getting angry, living a peaceful life is a blessing," "People love rich men, dogs bite ragged people," this is the bitter life we lived before liberation.

After liberation, the peaceful life that farmers had hoped for generations came. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the landlords and despots were overthrown, and the land was distributed. Even though farmers had land, they were both happy and worried. They were happy because they had land, but worried because they lacked oxen and farm tools and had difficulties in production. In 1952, the Party led us to organize primary cooperatives, and production became better and better. Last year, we switched to advanced cooperatives, and the enthusiasm of the members became even greater. The Party and the government gave us great support and led us to implement technological reforms. Therefore, in the first year of advanced cooperativization, we won a great victory. Compared with 1955, the total annual income of the cooperative increased by 42.68%, rice production increased by 52.6%, wheat production increased by 333%, cotton production increased by 38.6%, rapeseed production increased by 35.4%, and pigs have reached 1.1 per household, an increase of 50% compared to 1955. The superiority of the cooperative educated every member. The members said that things that could not be done in the past can now be done in the cooperative. Improved varieties and technological reforms were known to be good before, but no one dared to do them. It was said, "The moon in the pond can be seen, but cannot be taken out." Now it is different. Last year alone, the change from indica rice to japonica rice increased the yield per mu from 600 jin to 897 jin. In the past, raising fish in ponds yielded no more than 50 jin per mu. Last year, after cooperativization, the yield reached 300 to 400 jin by implementing mixed stocking and artificial feeding. The cooperative's production increased, and the members' net income also increased greatly. On average, the entire cooperative increased by 33.3% compared to 1955, from 69 yuan per person in 1955 to 92 yuan. 96% of the members in the entire cooperative increased their income, and everyone was beaming with joy. In the past, if anyone wore a piece of silk fabric, it was called "putting an embroidered ball on a thatched roof." Now everyone has new clothes. In the past, the poor peasant Wan Dengen covered himself with straw in winter and had never seen a quilt. He had never seen a mosquito net in summer, and only had one pair of pants. Now he has cotton clothes and quilts, and several new clothes. In the past, he was most afraid of getting sick when transplanting rice and harvesting grain. If he got sick, a year's life would be over. Farmers said that they don't want to get rich, they just want to be free from pain and illness. Now they don't have to worry about it anymore. The unified purchase and sale of grain is really a reassuring pill. With stable prices, farmers no longer have to worry about hoarding and speculation or low grain prices hurting farmers. Last year, the unified purchase left 620 jin of grain per person, and there were no households lacking grain. In the past, when girls married, it was hard to find someone who had grain to eat after wheat, and wheat to eat after grain. Now everyone is like that. The poor peasants said that the success of the cooperative is our victory. At the beginning of the cooperative, some people worried and said, "Three brothers and four younger brothers want to divide the family, and seven wives and eight old people can't survive three summers." This year, no one says that anymore. The poor peasant Tao Zhaoxian lost money every year before joining the cooperative. He sighed, "Half a liter of life, no matter how early you get up; one and a half liters of life, no matter how late you sleep." The whole year is like digging lotus roots, digging one drain and filling another, and in the end it is still a drain. After joining the cooperative, he became the production team leader. Last year he had money left over and is building a new house this winter. The whole family is wearing new clothes. He said, "Only the cooperative can solve difficulties." This is what our farmers are thinking today.

Of course, because the cooperative is newly established, we still have many shortcomings. The management of the cooperative is not good, and there is still some idleness in some places. The principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily is not fully implemented, and there is some waste in financial expenditures. There is also a lot of subjectivism in our work. Last year, when we promoted medium japonica rice, it caused a reduction in production because it was not tested. However, we believe that in a few years, the cooperative will become more and more experienced, production will increase more and more, and life will definitely continue to improve. "Drink water, never forget the well-digger; farmers never forget the Communist Party." Looking at the present and thinking about the past, the farmers will always follow the Communist Party. Those gentlemen who speak sweet words and "speak for the farmers," please show us, calculate the accounts, and compare. What have you done for the farmers? We farmers only look at the facts and do not listen to empty words. You want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. You say that farmers' lives are hard. What is your basis? The farmers ask, if we don't want the leadership of the Communist Party, who should lead us? The Kuomintang or who? What are your intentions when you say these words?

### 喝水不忘挖井人，农民不忘共产党  饶兴礼的发言

    喝水不忘挖井人，农民不忘共产党
    饶兴礼的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。
    现在我就农业合作化和农民的生活情况发表一点意见，最近从报上看到有些人以帮助党整风为名，向党进行了疯狂的进攻，说“农业合作化和统购统销搞糟了”“农民生活太苦了”等等，不知道这些人说话是站在什么立场上，根据是什么？我想最好还是请他们看看农村里的事实，看看农村这几年发生的变化，我是个农民，解放前我们过着牛马不如的生活，天灾加人祸一言难尽，辛辛苦苦一年到头收点粮食不够给地主交租，交不起租还得给他白做活，挑水、做饭、抬轿子什么都得干。不管农忙农闲送不完国民党的军差，一出就是几天几夜，很多人忍受不了就假装跛子，骗他打成拐子回去。保甲长派款专找穷人出，派夫抓丁提心吊胆，黄冈县陈东成躲壮丁跑到我们浠水县结果还是捉去了，日本投降跑回来不久，国民党打内战又要抽他，他吓的又偷偷跑回黄冈县，他妈妈到处说他死了，给他做了斋哭了大半年，两年以后直到解放才躲过去了。“不管日子怎样苦，不送军差，不呕气，过个安圆日子就是福”“人爱有钱汉，狗咬破衣人”这就是解放前我们过的辛酸生活。
    解放后，农民世世代代盼望的安圆日子来到了，在毛主席共产党的领导下，打倒了地主恶霸，分了田有了田农民还是又喜又愁，喜是分了田，愁是缺少耕牛农具生产困难。一九五二年党又领导我们组织了初级社，生产就越搞越好了，去年转了高级社，社员们劲头更大了，党和政府又给了我们大力支援，领导我们实行了技术改革，因此在高级化的第一年就打了一个大胜仗，和一九五五年比较，社的全年总收入增加了百分之四十二点六八，稻谷增产百分之五十二点六，小麦增产百分之三百三十三，棉花增产百分之三十八点六，油菜增产百分之三十五点四，猪已经达到每户一点一头，比一九五五年增加百分之五十，合作社的优越性教育了每个社员，社员说过去不能办的事情现在合作社都能办到了，改良品种、技术改革以前也知道好，但是谁也不敢搞，叫“塘里的月亮看得到，拿不起来”，现在不同了，仅去年籼稻改粳稻，每亩产量就由六百斤提高到八百九十七斤，塘里养鱼过去每亩不过五十斤，去年合作化后实行了混合放养人工喂食产量达到三、四百斤，社里增产、社员们的纯收入也大大增加了，平均全社比一九五五年增加百分之三十三点三，每人由一九五五年的六十九元提高到九十二元，全社有百分之九十六的社员增加了收入，个个喜笑颜开，过去有谁穿件府绸衣服，叫“茅屋头上安绣球”，现在每个人都有了新衣服，贫农万登安过去冬天盖稻草从来未见过被子，夏天没见过蚊帐，裤子只有一腰，现在有棉衣棉被，还有几件新衣服，以前在插秧割谷时最怕害病，病了一年的生活就完了，农民说不想发财没痛没病就要得，现在用不着担心了，粮食统购统销真是个定心丸，物价稳定农民再也不担心囤积居奇谷贱伤农了。去年统购每人留粮六百二十斤缺粮户一个都没有了，以前姑娘嫁人找个谷接麦，麦接谷的找不到，现在都是这样的了，贫农说合作社办好了就是我们的胜利，办社初有的耽心说“三兄四弟要分家，七娘八老子的人过不了三个夏”，今年谁也不说了。贫农陶兆先入社前年年亏，自叹“命上半升那怕你起五更，命上一升半那怕你睡到几大暗”，一年到底像挖藕一样，挖个淌，填个淌，最后还是个淌。入社后当了生产队长，去年剩下钱今年冬天要盖新房子，全家都穿上了新衣服，他说“困难只有合作社才能解决”，这就是今天我们农民的心里话。
    当然由于合作社新办，我们还有不少缺点，社的管理不善，某些地方还有窝工现象，勤俭办社方针贯彻不够财务开支上有些浪费，在工作中还有不少的主观主义，去年推广中粳时，因为没有经过试验，曾造成减产，但是我们相信再过几年社就越办越有经验了，生产会越来越增加，生活也一定会不断得到改善，“喝水不忘挖井人，农民不忘共产党”，看看现在想想过去，农民永远跟着共产党。甜言蜜语“替农民说话”的那些先生们请摆一摆看，算算账对比一下，你们替农民做了些什么事，我们农民是只看事实，不听空话的。你们要取消共产党的领导，你们说农民生活苦，你们的根据是什么？农民问不要共产党领导要谁来领导，要国民党还是要那个来，你们说这些话究竟是居心何在？
