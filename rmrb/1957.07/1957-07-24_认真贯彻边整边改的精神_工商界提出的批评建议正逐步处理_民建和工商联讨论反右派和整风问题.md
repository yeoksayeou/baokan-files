The issue of paying female industrialists and businesswomen their wages during maternity leave has also been determined and issued. Regarding the handling of account books from the period of private operation of enterprises, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and other departments have drafted measures and will publish them soon. There are also some important issues involving a wide range of aspects, such as the system of public-private joint management and the removal of the "capitalist" label for small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen. Relevant departments are repeatedly studying them, preparing to formulate regulations and gradually solve them.
　　Xu Dixing said that the government attaches importance to the opinions raised by everyone and is seriously implementing the spirit of rectification while correcting. He hopes that everyone will continue to offer opinions on various tasks.
