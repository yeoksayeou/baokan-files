Xinhua News Agency, July 5th—The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued its group discussions this morning.

	Representatives from Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Hebei, Henan, Guangdong, Overseas Chinese, Fujian, Guizhou, and other groups continued to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois rightists in their discussions.

	Today, at the Jiangxi Province representative group meeting, Luo Longji made a self-criticism, but he still argued that he and Zhang Bojun "only had an ideological alliance, not a political alliance." Starting from this point, Luo Longji first talked about his relationship with Zhang Bojun.

	He said that it was a fact that he had cooperated with Zhang Bojun for the past year. He regarded Zhang Bojun as a "left-wing progressive," and they "hit it off" well in their conversations. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, there were many anti-Soviet remarks in British and American magazines. After reading them, he developed "doubts" about communism. After the Polish and Hungarian events, British and American magazines promoted the idea that tens of thousands of intellectuals had fled to the West, and he felt that "the communist system had problems." He said that this was a commonality in thought between him and Zhang Bojun. So, they sought out professors and intellectuals from various schools to reflect their opinions and asked them what their sufferings were. He said that after they collected these opinions, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a week-long meeting to specifically analyze and study the situation of intellectuals. He and Zhang Bojun proposed the discussion of the intellectuals issue at the CPPCC meeting this year. He said he suggested establishing an intellectuals committee in the CPPCC. He sympathized with intellectuals and appealed for their treatment.

	Luo Longji said that his cooperation with Zhang Bojun began within the League. At the China Democratic League work conference in April this year, Zhang Bojun proposed making “blooming and contending” the central task of the China Democratic League, and he supported him. Their common ground was to cater to intellectuals, win over intellectuals, develop the organization, and elevate themselves.

	Luo Longji said that after the China Democratic League work conference, four groups were formed within the League. Zhang Bojun had already talked about this, but he did not reveal the conspiracy of organizing the four groups. He said that he understood Zhang Bojun's conspiracy was that the establishment of the group to abolish the system of Party committees in universities, indeed wanted to achieve the goal of abolishing the system of Party committees in universities. Zhang told him: "This matter should be done in a big way, send people to collect opinions from various places to see the trend; the system of Party committees will definitely be eliminated." As for the establishment of the group with positions but no power, it was intended to develop forces to "compete with" the Communist Party; the establishment of the group for "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was intended to participate in the highest decision-making meetings. He said that Zhang Bojun's establishment of four groups was not only to ignite the fire in Beijing but also to send people to ignite the fire in various places.

	Luo Longji said that the so-called organization was to utilize the China Democratic League. He said that he and Zhang Bojun were allies in thought, both dissatisfied with the Party and suspicious of communism, so their actions were also consistent. He argued that he had wrong views on the leadership of the Party, but he did not want to overthrow the Communist Party.

	When talking about his relationship with Chu Anping, Luo Longji flatly denied that he had seen Chu Anping's speech beforehand, but he said that he had talked with Chu Anping. He completely agreed with Chu Anping's set of ideas and supported Chu Anping in writing articles.

	When talking about his relationship with Wenhui Daily, Luo Longji admitted that he brought many unhealthy right-wing ideas to Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu. He believed that Wenhui Daily should not be the same as People's Daily, and should not completely stand on the Party's position. He also told Xu Zhucheng "not to trust the newspaper's Party committee and to discuss things more with Beijing." But Luo Longji evaded explaining his true intentions in manipulating Wenhui Daily.

	Jiangxi representatives were very dissatisfied with Luo Longji's dishonest and incomplete "self-criticism," pointing out that he did not talk about specific facts on the important issue of the Zhang-Luo alliance and attempted to muddle through. The representatives also raised many questions, demanding that he thoroughly confess.

	Huang Xianfan, a representative from Guangxi Province, exposed Huang Shaohong's support and shielding of counter-revolutionary elements and the reactionary behavior of Xie Xin, a female student at Beijing Normal University. The counter-revolutionary element Xie Xin had close ties with the secret agent leader Wang Tiaoxun before liberation and infiltrated Beijing Normal University after liberation. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, she wrote reactionary slogans and bought a kitchen knife to plot the assassination of Party cadres and was immediately arrested by the government. In 1956, the government released her based on the lenient policy. After returning to school, she did not repent and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, such as spreading rumors everywhere, inciting the masses to slander government policies, and secretly tearing up school announcements. In this rectification, she took the opportunity to stir up trouble, maliciously "accuse" and incite activities. More seriously, she fabricated rumors and slandered the new China in front of reporters from imperialist countries. Huang Xianfan went on to say that Xie Xin's series of destructive activities received the support of Huang Shaohong. Huang Shaohong did not seriously investigate the case during his inspection, but said that the Xie Xin case had been wrongly handled by the government. He also maliciously attacked the Communist Party in his speeches at some meetings, based on the Xie Xin case, which he believed was wrong. Huang Shaohong also repeatedly found the counter-revolutionary Xie Xin to talk to him secretly at his home, and often clamored that he would personally go to Beijing Normal University to "seek justice" for Xie Xin. After Huang Xianfan, a representative, exposed Huang Shaohong's reactionary facts, he asked Huang Shaohong to explain what he and Xie Xin were up to? Many representatives questioned Huang Shaohong as to why he gave such great sympathy and support to counter-revolutionary elements and demanded a thorough explanation.

	Representatives from the Zhejiang Province group today exposed Huang Shaohong's anti-communist and anti-people crimes when he served as chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government twice before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Qiu Qinghua, a representative who had been arrested and imprisoned by Huang Shaohong's reactionary armed forces, said that in Pingyang County alone, more than 1,500 revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses were brutally killed by Huang Shaohong, and more than 600 houses were burned down. Huang Shaohong also murdered Liu Ying, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in 1942. In his speech, Qiu Qinghua also exposed Huang Shaohong's shielding of Zhang Shaowu, a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts. The representatives said that Huang Shaohong's crimes were extremely serious. If he does not seriously explain his current anti-Party and anti-socialist activities and repent and confess his sins, he will not be forgiven by the people.

	Huang Qixiang, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, repeatedly stated in his speech of more than two hours at the Guangdong Province representative group meeting that he "did not" have anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, emphasized that Zhang Bojun's anti-communist activities "had not" been discussed with him, and said that the inspection team of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, headed by him, "did not" intend to shield Zhang Bojun. After Huang Qixiang's speech, many representatives pointed out that Huang Qixiang's attitude was not honest and asked him to explain in detail.

	Today, representative groups from Sichuan, Guizhou, Fujian, and other provinces continued to discuss various aspects of the government's work.

    人民代表继续追击右派集团
    罗隆基吞吞吐吐承认章罗联盟
    广西浙江代表揭露黄绍竑包庇反革命分子
    据新华社5日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午继续分组讨论。
    广西、浙江、江西、湖南、江苏、上海、河北、河南、广东、华侨、福建、贵州等代表小组，在讨论中继续揭露和批判了资产阶级右派分子的反动言行。
    罗隆基今天在江西省代表小组会上作了检讨，但是，他仍然狡赖说他同章伯钧“只有思想联盟，没有政治联盟”。从这一点出发，罗隆基首先谈到他同章伯钧的关系。
    他说，一年来他同章伯钧合作是事实。他把章伯钧看成是一个“左派进步分子”，他们谈话“很投机”。在苏共二十次代表大会以后，英美杂志上有许多反苏言论，他看了以后对共产主义发生了“怀疑”。在波匈事件以后，英美杂志宣扬有成千上万的知识分子逃到西方，他觉得“共产主义制度有毛病”，他说这是同章伯钧思想共同的地方。于是他们找各学校的教授、知识分子反映意见，问他们有什么痛苦。他说，他们把意见搜集以后，民盟中委开了一周会议，专门对知识分子的情况进行分析研究。这一年在政协会议上讨论知识分子问题是他和章伯钧提出的。他说他建议在政协设立知识分子委员会。他同情知识分子，为他们的待遇呼吁。
    罗隆基说，他同章伯钧的合作，首先是在盟内。今年4月民盟工作会议，章伯钧提议把“鸣”“放”作为民盟中心工作，他支持他。他们共同之点就是迎合知识分子，拉拢知识分子，发展组织，提高自己。
    罗隆基说，民盟工作会议以后，在盟内搞了四个小组，章伯钧已经谈过，但章伯钧没有谈出组织四个小组的阴谋。他说他了解章伯钧的阴谋是，成立取消高等学校党委制小组，的确想达到取消高等学校党委制的目的。章对他说：“这事要大搞一下，派人到各地搜集意见，看趋势，党委制一定会消灭”。至于成立有职无权小组，是想发展力量同共产党“分庭抗礼”；成立“长期共存、互相监督”小组，是想参加最高决策会议。他说，章伯钧成立四个小组不仅是在北京点火，还要派人到各地点火。
    罗隆基说，所谓有组织，就是利用民盟。他说他和章伯钧是思想上的联盟，都对党不满，对共产主义怀疑，所以行动上也一致了。他狡赖说他对党的领导，有错误的看法，但不是想推翻共产党。
    谈到他和储安平的关系时，罗隆基矢口否认他事先曾看过储安平的发言稿，不过他说曾同储安平谈过话。他对储安平的一套思想完全同意，并支持储安平写文章。
    谈到他和文汇报的关系时，罗隆基承认，他通过浦熙修带了许多不健康的右派思想给文汇报。他认为文汇报不要和人民日报一样，不要完全站在党的立场，他也曾要徐铸成“不要相信报社党委，有事多到北京商量商量”。但罗隆基回避交代他操纵文汇报的真实企图。
    江西代表们对罗隆基的不老实不彻底的“检讨”很不满意，指出他在章罗联盟的重要问题上没有谈具体事实，企图蒙混过去，代表们并提出了许多问题要他彻底交代。
    广西省代表黄现璠揭露了黄绍竑支持和包庇反革命分子、北京师范大学女学生谢昕的反动行为，反革命分子谢昕在解放前和特务头子王调勋有密切关系，解放后混入北京师范大学。在肃反中，她写反动标语，并买菜刀图谋杀害党员干部，当即被政府逮捕。1956年，政府根据宽大政策把她释放。她回校后仍不悔改，继续进行反革命活动，如她到处造谣，煽动群众污蔑政府政策，暗自撕毁校方布告等。在这次整风中，她又乘机兴风作浪，恶意进行“控诉”和煽动活动。更严重的是她在帝国主义国家记者的面前，造谣污蔑新中国。黄现璠接着说，谢昕的一连串的破坏活动，得到了黄绍竑的支持。黄绍竑在视察中没有认真调查案情，反说谢昕案件被政府弄错了。他并在一些会议上的发言中，以他自己认为错了的谢昕案件为根据，恶意地向共产党进攻。黄绍竑还多次把反革命分子谢昕找到他的家里秘密谈话，还常扬言要亲自到北京师范大学为谢昕“申冤”。黄现璠代表揭露黄绍竑的反动事实后，要黄绍竑交代他和谢昕搞什么勾当？许多代表们都质问黄绍竑为什么对反革命分子给以这么大的同情和支持？要彻底交代。
    浙江省小组的代表今天揭露了黄绍竑在抗日战争以前两度任浙江省政府主席时的反共反人民罪行。曾经遭到黄绍竑反动武装逮捕监禁的丘清华代表说，单平阳一县被黄绍竑残杀的革命干部和革命群众就有一千五百多人，烧毁的房子达六百多座。黄绍竑在1942年还谋害了中共浙江省委书记刘英。丘清华在发言中，还揭露了黄绍竑包庇血债累累的反革命分子张韶舞。代表们说，黄绍竑的罪恶是极为深重的，如果他对现在的反党反社会主义的活动再不认真交代，悔过认罪，他将得不到人民的饶恕。
    中国农工民主党副主席兼秘书长黄琪翔，今天在广东省代表小组会上两个多小时的发言中再三表明他“没有”反党反社会主义的言行，强调章伯钧的反对共产党的活动“没有”与他商量过，并且说农工民主党中央以他为首的检查小组“没有”包庇章伯钧过关的意图。在黄琪翔发言后，许多代表指出黄琪翔的态度不老实，要他详细交代。
    今天，四川、贵州、福建等代表小组继续就政府各方面的工作进行讨论。
