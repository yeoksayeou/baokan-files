Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 25th: The Egyptian government distributed a total of over 20,000 acres of land to 6,000 landless or land-poor farming households in thirteen agricultural areas on the 24th. This is a portion of the 800,000 acres of land to be distributed to landless or land-poor farmers according to the Egyptian land reform law. In the past few years, over 280,000 acres of land have already been distributed to over 68,000 farming households.

　　On this day, a celebration rally for land distribution was held in a village near Mansoura, the capital of Dakahlia Province. This rally was one of the events in Egypt's nationwide celebration of the fifth anniversary of the revolution these days. The Egyptian Minister of State for Land Reform, Sayyid Marei, attended the rally on behalf of Egyptian President Nasser.

　　On the same day, the Egyptian government also distributed 900 standard houses to impoverished farmers. These houses were built by the government, and the residents are to repay the government for the cost of the houses within twenty years.

　　Egypt's land reform law stipulates that the land occupied by general landlords shall not exceed 200 feddans (one feddan equals 6.3 mu) plus 100 feddans for their children. All surplus land shall be purchased by the state and distributed to farmers, or sold by the landlords to farmers at market prices. Farmers who receive land distributed by the government must also repay the government for the land price, which is equivalent to the price paid by the government to the landlords plus a 15% handling fee. Farmers must pay off the land price within thirty years, with an annual interest rate of 3%.

　　Egyptian Minister of State for Land Reform Sayyid Marei told reporters on the 24th that before the land reform in Egypt, approximately 1,600 large landlords owned 35% of the total arable land in Egypt, while the vast number of small farmers owned only about 15% of the total arable land in the country. Now, the land owned by large landlords accounts for only 6% of the total arable land in the country, and the land owned by the vast number of small farmers accounts for 50% of the total arable land.

    埃及政府分地给农民
    在三十年内收回土地价格
    据新华社开罗25日电　埃及政府24日在十三个农业地区把总共二万多英亩土地分配给了六千家无地或少地的农户。这是按照埃及土地改革法规定要分配给无地或少地农户的八十万英亩土地中的一部分。过去几年中，已经有二十八万多英亩的土地分配给了六万八千多家农户。
    这一天，在达卡利亚省省会曼苏拉附近的村庄里举行了一个分配土地的庆祝大会。这个大会是这几天埃及全国庆祝革命五周年纪念活动中的一个项目。埃及负责土地改革的国务部长赛义德·马雷代表埃及总统纳赛尔出席了大会。
    同一天，埃及政府还把九百所标准房屋分配给贫困农户。这些房屋是政府建造的，住户要在二十年内偿还政府房屋造价。
    埃及的土地改革法规定，一般地主占有的土地不得超过二百费丹（一费丹合六点三市亩）另留给子女一百费丹，所有多余土地一律由国家征购后分配给农民或由地主按市价自行出卖给农民。得到政府分配土地的农民也要向政府偿付地价，这价格相当于政府向地主征购的价格加15％的手续费。农民要在三十年内付清地价，并付年息3％。
    埃及负责土地改革的国务部长赛义德·马雷24日对新闻记者说，在埃及土地改革以前，大约有一千六百个大地主占有了埃及可耕地总面积的35％，广大小农户所有耕地只占全国耕地总面积的15％左右。现在，大地主所有土地只占全国耕地总面积的6％，广大小农户所有土地占耕地总面积的50％。
