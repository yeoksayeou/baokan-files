    Birds of a Feather Flock Together
    What Did Luo Longji Like and Dislike During His Inspection?

Editor:

    Luo Longji said that he had not engaged in any anti-communist or anti-socialist activities after liberation, which is not true. Here is a revelation of one of his anti-communist and anti-socialist facts.

    Luo Longji is from Anfu County, Jiangxi Province. In early June 1955, he came to Anfu County as a representative of the National People's Congress for an inspection. At that time, in order to facilitate the introduction of rural conditions, with the introduction of the leadership, and with the consent of Luo Longji himself, we went to Anfu County with him to assist him in his inspection work. Although Luo Longji's inspection work in Anfu County lasted only three days, he did not give up his anti-people and anti-socialist activities.

    Luo Longji attempted to undermine the Party's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain by taking advantage of the relatively tight grain supply in some areas at that time. When he heard his landlord relatives say that they had no rice to eat, he immediately sympathized and said, "If you raise your opinions and they are not resolved, write to me in Beijing later." However, when he heard some other people say that there was enough grain to eat, he expressed doubt. Zhou X, a poor peasant from the same village as Luo Longji, told him, "The lack of grain is an individual phenomenon." But he sarcastically said, "Are you an activist!" He went to the home of the deputy township head of Fengtian Township to understand the grain supply situation. The deputy township head said, "The grain is generally enough to eat, and very few people don't have enough." He said, "Don't give me bureaucratic talk." When several responsible cadres of Fengtian Township reported to him on the grain work situation, saying, "The policy is good, and the leadership of the Party at the higher level is also correct. The reason why there are some problems in the work now is mainly because the unified purchase and sale of grain is a new task, and the cadres lack experience and have not studied the policy enough, so the work in some places is not good enough." He said, "What's good about the policy? It has made the people quarrel." Then he said irresponsibly, "Chairman Mao personally went to the countryside to investigate for seventeen days, and returned to Beijing and said: For 90% of the people in the countryside, there is no problem with grain, but the situation I found out is that 90% of the people are complaining."

    When Luo Longji inspected the countryside, he liked to contact some disreputable people. For example, landlords, Kuomintang members, and his "good relatives" and "old friends," etc. Luo Longji had long talks with these people. When he talked with them, Luo Longji drove us out of the door and did not allow us to enter. At that time, on the one hand, we were suspicious of his sneaky actions, and on the other hand, we felt that Luo Longji was a representative of the National People's Congress, so in order to show respect for the people's representatives, we had to obey him. Now it seems that there are many problems here. What exactly did Luo Longji say to these people, and what did he do? We hope that Luo Longji himself will make a public explanation.

    When Luo Longji left Anfu, he said to his nephew Luo Yigao (middle peasant): "You want to work. I have dozens of guards there, and I need to add more people. You can go, more than one hundred points a month. Kui Wu can't come, he is a Communist Party member."

    During his inspection in the Ji'an area, Luo Longji tried everywhere to expand his influence, thoroughly exposing his bourgeois essence. When Luo Longji talked to others, he had to brag: "There was a phone call from Beijing, very short time"; "Going back to open the National Congress of the China Democratic League"; "Going abroad in July to participate in the World Congress for Peace"; "After returning to China, the National People's Congress will be opened"; "I brought three guards," etc., and even told others everywhere, "These people (referring to our accompanying staff) are all my servants." He treated the accompanying state staff as his "servants."

    Luo Longji's lifestyle during his inspection in Anfu was very special. For example, he disliked the poor food in the organs, went to restaurants, and ate and drank extravagantly. The impact on cadres and farmers was very bad.

### 物以类聚气味相投  罗隆基在视察中喜恶什么？

    物以类聚气味相投
    罗隆基在视察中喜恶什么？编辑同志：
    罗隆基说他在解放以后，没有进行过反共反社会主义活动，这不是事实。这里就来揭露他一件反共反社会主义的事实。
    罗隆基是江西安福县人。1955年6月初旬，他以全国人民代表大会代表的身份来安福县视察。当时，为了便利介绍农村情况，经过领导上的介绍，并且经过罗隆基本人同意，我们随同前去安福县，协助他进行视察工作。罗隆基在安福县视察工作的时间虽然只有三天，但他不放弃他的反人民反社会主义活动。
    罗隆基利用当时某些地方粮食供应比较紧张的情况，企图达到破坏党的粮食统购统销政策。他听到他的地主亲属说，没有米吃，立即同情地说：“提意见，不解决，以后写信到北京来找我。”但是，当他听到另外一些人反映粮食够吃时，就表示怀疑。和罗隆基同村的贫农周?生告诉他“粮食不够吃，是个别的现象。”他却恶毒地讽刺说：“你是积极分子吧！”他到枫田乡副乡长家里了解粮食供应情况。副乡长说：“粮食一般够吃，不够吃的很少。”他就说，“你们不要打官腔。”枫田乡几位负责干部向他汇报粮食工作情况时，说：“政策是好的，上级党的领导也是正确的。现在工作中之所以存在一些问题，主要是由于粮食统购统销是一项新的工作，干部缺乏经验和对政策学习不够，所以有的地方的工作还做的不够好。”他就说：“政策好什么？搞得老百姓都吵起来了。”接着他信口开河地说：“毛主席亲自下乡摸了十七天，回到北京说：粮食在农村是90％的人没有问题，而我下来摸的情况是90％的人叫起来。”
    罗隆基在乡下视察的时候，喜欢和一些不三不四的人接触。例如地主、国民党员，和他的“好亲戚”“老朋友”等人。罗隆基和这些人进行了长时间的谈话。在和他们谈话的时候，罗隆基把我们赶到门外，不准我们入内。当时我们一方面对他这种鬼鬼祟祟的行动感到怀疑，另一方面又觉得罗隆基是一个全国人民代表，为了表示对于人民代表的尊敬，我们只好听从他摆布。现在看起来这里面是有很多问题的。罗隆基和这些人究竟说了些什么话，干了一些什么事？希望罗隆基本人公开交代。
    罗隆基在离开安福时，曾经对他的侄子罗谊高（中农）说：“你要工作，我那里有几十个警卫，还要增加人，你可以去，一月一百多分。奎五来不行，他是共产党员。”
    罗隆基在吉安地区视察工作期间，处处为自己扩大影响，彻头彻尾地露出了他的资产阶级的本质。罗隆基与别人谈话时，都要吹嘘一番：“北京来电话，时间很短”；“回去要开民盟全国代表会”；“7月出国参加世界和大会议”；“回国后要开全国人民代表大会”；“我带了三个警卫员”，等话，甚至还到处对别人说“这些人（指我们随行人员）都是我的佣人。”把随行的国家工作人员当作他的“佣人”看待。
    罗隆基在安福视察期间的生活作风，非常特殊。例如，他嫌机关伙食差，到饭馆去，大吃大喝。在干部和农民中的影响很坏。
