*XinHua Daily* of Nanjing Publishes Editorial: Counterattacking the Rightists Requires No Sentimentalism

　　(Our dispatch) Nanjing *XinHua Daily* published an editorial on July 6 entitled "Counterattacking the Rightists Requires No Sentimentalism." The editorial stated that in the struggle against the Rightists, there is an important problem: being soft-handed and unable to strike down effectively. This is because some of these Rightists were old friends or old colleagues; some were scholars or experts. The editorial said that it is common for people to feel pity and cherish talent, but can we stand idly by and watch friends go astray? As for people with specialized skills and knowledge who have taken the wrong path, it is even more regrettable and should be rectified. Our struggle against them is precisely our attempt to salvage them. The further they stray, the more forceful our help and struggle must be, otherwise, their chances of turning back will be even smaller. This is only from a personal perspective. From the perspective of the overall national interest, the people's interest, and the entire future of mankind, we must not sacrifice the greater good for the lesser, nor can we, because of sentimentalism towards individual Rightists, plunge the entire country and the people into misery. If we always maintain this sentimentalism, it is to love individuals and not the masses, to cherish small talents and not great talents, small sentimentalism and great inhumanity, which is not what a benevolent person should do. Some people say, "Struggle is fine, but it should be done gently and gradually to make them turn back." Yes, if gentle methods can make the Rightists turn back, that would be the best thing. But this is just wishful thinking. What they are doing is a major matter of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and opposing the socialist future. They are resolute and have their eyes set on becoming enemies of the people. If we do not wage a resolute and large-scale struggle against them, they will not only not change their minds but will also think that the people are weak and can be deceived! Especially those backbone elements and representatives among the Rightists, our criticisms of their mistakes have always been gentle, but have they stopped at the edge of the precipice because of this? Have their reactionary words and deeds not become even more rampant? Attempting to clarify the problems of these Rightists with gentle methods is a bookish view. Don't you see that Zhang Naiqi is still stubbornly unrepentant, and Zhang Bojun is still squeezing out information like toothpaste, revealing a little bit at a time? If the Rightists do not truly surrender, we must unleash an even greater mass-based storm. The more the Rightists resist, the more intense the storm should be. This should become a direct correlation. Some people say that the counterattack against the Rightists should not involve naming names or publishing in the newspapers, because once they are published in the newspapers, they will be disgraced. The fact is that the Rightists themselves are smelly, and some old Rightists were originally very smelly. The people were originally magnanimous and wanted to help them wash away some of the stench, but they did not cherish themselves too much and went against the people, only becoming more and more smelly. For these people, being named and published in the newspapers is smelly, and not being named and published in the newspapers is also smelly. Anyway, they are destined to be smelly. Being smelly also has its benefits: people will no longer be fooled by them, their reactionary fallacies will have no market, and they will not be able to poison people. Isn't this a great thing? Naturally, some Rightists who usually disguise themselves cleverly, emit a stench and insist that others emitted it, or say that it is merely "resonance"; they even put on the airs of scholars and experts, saying, "Politics is dirty, and I will definitely resign in the future." They pretend to be pure. Is politics dirty? Politics that serves the people is originally clean and pure, only when it attempts to conspire for the restoration of the bourgeoisie does it become dirty and smelly. This cannot be blamed on politics itself but only on those who "change." For such hypocrites, naming names and publishing in the newspapers seems even more necessary. Because this is nothing more than letting everyone see these hypocrites, so that people can recognize their true faces, making them lose all support and become completely isolated, so that they cannot carry out their dirty political activities, and so that people will not be fooled again. Isn't this a great good deed that benefits society and the people? Some people say, "Struggle is fine, but we shouldn't put on big hats." Randomly labeling people is of course not good, but perhaps not labeling people is not acceptable either. Everyone with a head should wear a hat; the question is whether it is appropriate. Those who are Rightists must wear the hat of Rightists, those who are Rightist backbone elements must wear the hat of Rightist backbone elements, and those who are neither should not be made to wear one. If they do, it is a mistake and should be taken off for them. What's wrong with that? Some people also say, "Doesn't this just kill them with one blow? Doesn't it contradict the principle of being kind to others?" We say that we are kind to others, but the struggle against the Rightists belongs to the scope of class struggle. The people are irreconcilable with the Rightists' conspiracy to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. Do we not need to kill such a conspiracy? Of course, for the Rightists themselves, as long as they can stop at the edge of the precipice and turn back, we can not kill them, we can be kind to them, we can keep them for continued transformation. As long as they can be reborn, their future is still bright. The fact is that they are not kind to us. It is not a question of whether we want to be kind. We are now using methods of resolving non-antagonistic contradictions to deal with this antagonistic contradiction. Isn't this generous enough, isn't this being benevolent and doing everything possible?
　　The editorial said that, in short, people's soft-handedness in fighting the Rightists is due to the great role played by sentimentalism. People's underestimation of the nature and seriousness of the anti-Rightist struggle is the main root of sentimentalism, and people's small benevolence and righteousness reduce their great benevolence and righteousness, that is, the courage and determination to fight the Rightists. These are extremely detrimental to the anti-Rightist struggle and to the great cause of our 600 million people building socialism. This is already obvious. Now we are writing this editorial to help well-meaning people make progress and actively and bravely engage in the struggle. Of course, these words are addressed to good people, to people who are wholeheartedly committed to building socialism, and even to people who are half-heartedly committed. For those Rightists who outwardly support the leadership of the Communist Party and support socialist construction, but in essence conspire to sabotage it, for those Rightists who falsely surrender to the people, and for those Rightists who are two-hearted with the people, it is a completely different matter. They must honestly confess to the people, lay down their butcher knives, and turn back to the shore. As long as they do not cut themselves off from the people, the people will be magnanimous and not cut off their path to survival. Do not think that disguising and changing can muddle through. No matter how much effort you make, no matter how many tricks you play, you cannot escape the palm of the people, the Tathagata Buddha.

    南京新华日报发表社论
    反击右派不能温情主义
  　本报讯　7月6日南京新华日报以“反击右派不能温情主义”为题发表了一篇社论。社论说，在反右派的斗争中，有一个重要问题，就是手软，打不下去。因为这些右派分子有的原是老朋友，老同事；有的是学者，专家。社论说，人们怜情惜才，原是常情，可是，朋友误入歧途，我们能视死不救吗？至于有专才实学的人走错了道路，则更为可惜，更应该挽救。人们对他们的斗争，正是对他们的挽救。他们走得越远，给他们的帮助和斗争愈要有力，否则他们回头的可能就愈小。这仅是从个人角度说的。从整个国家利益、人民利益和人类整个前途来说，我们更不能为小失大，更不能因为对个别右派分子的温情，而陷整个国家、人民于水火之中。如果始终保有这个温情，那就是怜个人而不爱大众，惜小才而不惜大才，小温情而大不人道，是为仁者所不应取。有些人说，斗就斗吧，但要和风细雨，使他回头。是的，如果和风细雨，右派分子能够回头，是最好也没有的事。但是这仅仅是好心的设想。他们干的是要推翻共产党领导，反掉社会主义前途的大事，他们是横了心的，是红了眼睛要与人民为敌的，我们不和他们作坚决的大规模的斗争，他们不但不会回心转意，而且还会以为人民是软弱，是可欺！特别是那些右派中的骨干分子、代表人物，我们向来对他们错误的批判就是和风细雨的，他们是否因此就悬崖勒马了呢？他们的反动言行不是更加猖狂了吗？企图用和风细雨的方法搞清楚这些右派分子的问题，是一种书生之见。君不见，章乃器至今仍顽固不化，章伯钧仍是挤牙膏一样，挤一下，交代一点吗？如果右派分子不真的缴械投降，我们就必须刮起更大的群众性的暴风骤雨。右派分子越顽抗，风雨就越要猛烈。这应该成为一个正比例。有人说，反右派分子不要点名、登报，登了报就臭了。事实是，右派分子本身就是臭的，而且，有些老右派分子原来就是很臭的。人民原来宽大为怀，想替他们洗洗刷刷，看能否减少一点臭气，可是他们太不自爱了，自己和人民背道而驰，只有臭上加臭。对这些人而言，点名登报也是臭，不点名登报也是臭。反正他们是臭定了。臭了也有好处，人们不会再上他们的当，他们的反动谬论就会没有市场，毒害不倒人，这岂不是大大的好事？自然，有些平常伪装得很巧妙的右派分子，自己放了一个臭气，硬赖着说是别人放的，或者说仅仅是“共鸣”；甚至还摆出一副学者专家的面目，说：“政治是龌龊的，将来一定辞职不干了。”装出自己一身香似的。政治是龌龊的吗？为人民服务的政治本来是清白的，香的，只有企图阴谋为资产阶级复辟，那就变成龌龊的了，变臭了，这不能怪政治本身而只能埋怨那种“变”的人。对于这样的伪君子，点名登报看来更为必要。因为这无非是让大家见识见识这些伪君子，使人们认清他们的本来面目，使他们众叛亲离，完全孤立起来，使他们想进行的龌龊政治勾当而无所施其伎俩，使人们不致再大上其当，这难道不是功在社会、泽及众人的大大好事吗？有人说，斗可以，不能扣大帽子。乱戴帽子当然不好，不戴帽子恐怕也不成。有头都要戴帽子，问题在乎是否合适。是右派分子就须戴右派分子的帽子，是右派骨干分子就戴右派骨干分子的帽子，都不是就不作兴戴，戴了就是戴错了，就应当替他摘下来。这又有什么不好呢？还有人说，这样子不就一棍子打死了吗？不是和与人为善的原则不相符合吗？我们说，我们是与人为善的，但和右派分子的斗争，是属于阶级斗争范围，人民对于右派分子反对共产党领导和反对社会主义的阴谋是不共戴天的，对于这种阴谋难道不需要打死吗？当然，对于右派分子本身，只要他能够悬崖勒马，回头是岸，我们是可以不打死他的，是可以与他为善的，是可以留下来继续改造的，只要他能脱胎换骨，他们的前途仍然是光明的。事实是他们不与我们为善，不是我们想不想为善的问题，我们现在对于这种对抗性矛盾用解决非对抗性矛盾的方法来处理，难道这还不够雅量，还不够仁至义尽吗？
    社论说，总而言之，人们斗争右派的手软，这是由于温情主义起了很大的作用。人们对反右派斗争的性质和严重性估计不足又是温情主义的主要根源，人们的一些小仁小义的观点也减少了人们的大仁大义，即对右派分子的斗争勇气和决心。这些，对反右派斗争极其不利，对我国六亿人民建设社会主义的伟大事业极其不利，这已经是显而易见的事了。现在我们写这篇社论，目的是帮助好心的人们能有所进步，积极勇敢的投入斗争。当然，这些话是对好人说的，是对建设社会主义事业采取一条心的人、甚至对半条心的人说的。对那些表面拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义建设，实质上阴谋破坏的右派分子，对那些向人民假投降的右派分子，和人民采取两条心的右派分子，则根本是另外一回事。他们要老老实实的向人民交代，放下屠刀，回头是岸。只要他们不自绝于人民，人民也就宽大为怀，不绝他们的生路。不要还以为伪装善变，可以蒙混过关，任你使出全身解数，耍尽花招，休想逃出人民这个如来佛的手掌心。
