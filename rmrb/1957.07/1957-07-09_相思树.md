    Acacia Tree
    Wen Shan

    Silently standing on the mountaintop, your lush green dress, evokes the thoughts of travelers. Who are you thinking of in the still night? You shed lonely tears. The blood-like red beans in the green grass tell me you never sleep.

    Last autumn, I returned to my long-missed hometown – a small coastal county in the South. I received a letter from a friend in Beijing when stopping halfway, asking me to bring back two red beans for him, and saying, "They must be big, very big!"

    However, although "red beans grow in the South," they are not everywhere in the South. This beautiful and sentimental seed is rare; it is not a commodity in shop windows. If you want red beans, you can only find them under the acacia tree. But this kind of tree is also hard to find. In my hometown, I only knew that there were two or three acacia trees on a small mountain thirty miles away from the county town. Every time I think of these trees, many memories of my youth are evoked.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, the middle school I attended was bombed by the Japanese devils, so we had to move from the city to the countryside to attend classes. At that time, life was hard. We lived in a leaky earth temple. The rice we ate contained wax because the kitchen cook was ruthless and put wax in the rice when it was cooked, so people ate less; most of the students got stomach problems. At that time, the roads were all dug into small ponds, so every time we went home for vacation, or returned to school after vacation, we had to walk, rain or shine, wearing "Thoroughbreds" made of two pieces of car tires, walking more than ninety miles a day. This road passed by the small mountain with acacia trees.

    In the great heat of southern Guangdong, the subtropical sun burned people's noses and mouths, and their eyes burned with fire, as if they were being steamed in a waterless steamer. As we walked, no one wanted to talk, and the road seemed particularly long. But as we approached the small mountain with acacia trees, we seemed to feel a cool breeze in our hearts because everyone rested under the dense shade of the acacia trees every time we passed. Under the trees was soft green grass; lying on the grass, the graceful acacia trees spread out their light green dresses, gently shielding us from the sun. Walking from the scorching sun into this cool green shade, one could not help but thank the owner who let you rest. After resting, everyone carefully parted the green grass and searched for the red beans that had fallen from the trees next to the roots of the grass...

    In our countryside, people call red beans "acacia beans." These small, exquisite seeds are crystal clear and dazzling, like a drop of blood condensed on glass, or a small, chaste heart; their bright red color never changes, like the longing burning in the hearts of rarely seen lovers. It is probably for this reason that some extremely clever person called this beautiful seed acacia bean and this gentle tree acacia tree?

    When people think of red beans, they often recall love; but in my memory, red beans do not carry the taste of longing, they only make me miss the hardships of the past, evoking distant and unforgettable feelings of unease – at that time, I had not yet seen the light of communism, and my steps were still very hesitant. Late at night, I read under the weak kerosene lamp, the light only shining a foot away. The lamp was made of glass, and I put dozens of red beans in the lamp, and through the kerosene and the crystal of the glass, the red beans were particularly bright red, which was almost the only decoration I had in the difficult war life. For this, I also have to thank the acacia trees on the small mountain.

    These are all very, very distant things, but they seem very close.

    The winds and clouds of history have swept through several centuries in more than ten years, and I finally returned to my hometown with a myriad of emotions. But this time, I did not have the opportunity to go to the acacia trees. I just climbed onto a drilling tower dozens of meters high in the newly discovered mining area, and looked out at the small mountain with acacia trees tens of miles away... I knew they were there, they must be more abundant than they were more than ten years ago, and the green grass under the trees must be denser and greener, and more happy children and young people will come to pick up red beans. But I couldn't see that small mountain, it was hiding in the clouds! The wind in the air ruffled my hair, and thousands of hectares of green rice fields spread out before my eyes; red and white flags of the exploration team were planted all over the vast mountains and fields. This land, which had been plagued by bandits and soldiers for so many years, had a completely new look. The drilling towers standing in the midst of the green, like a few invisible giant hands, holding iron pens, were writing a new history for my hometown in the annals of the earth...

    Looking at the distant mountains shrouded in clouds, the memories of the past hard years surged into my heart, and I wrote the little poem above to commemorate the acacia trees that silently share happiness with others.

    相思树
    闻山默默地站在山巅，葱绿的衣裙，牵引着行人的想念。是静夜里想着谁？你掉下了孤独的泪。青草里鲜血似的红豆，告诉我你从没有睡。
    去年秋天，我回到久别的故乡——南国海滨的一个小县城。在半路停留时，接到北京友人的一封信，要我给他带回两颗红豆，而且说：“要大的，要大大的！”
    可是，虽然“红豆生南国”，但并不是南国到处都有红豆。这美丽多情的种子，是稀罕的，它不是商店窗橱中的货物。你想要红豆，只有到相思树下去找。但这种树也难得看见。在我的家乡，我也只知道在离县城三十里的一个小山上，有两三株相思树。每想起这几棵树，便勾起我许多年少时的记忆。
    抗日战争中，我念书的那个中学被日本鬼子炸了，只好从城里搬到乡下去上课。那时候，生活是苦的。住的是漏雨的土地庙。吃的饭里面有蜡，因为厨房伙头狠心，米下锅时放了蜡，人就吃得少；学生大半得了胃病。那时，公路全被挖成了一个个小池塘，因此每逢假期回家，或者假期满了返学，不管晴天下雨，都得步行，脚上穿着用两块汽车轮胎做的“千里马”，一天步行九十多里地。这条路，就从长着相思树的小山旁边经过。
    广东南部的大暑天，亚热带的太阳晒得人口鼻发烧，两眼冒火，人就像在个没有水的蒸笼里干蒸。走着走着，谁都不愿讲话了，路也就显得特别长。但行近了长着相思树的小山，心里便好像感到一阵清凉，因为每次经过，大家都在相思树的浓荫下歇息。树下，是软软的青草；躺在草上，亭亭玉立的相思树，展开她浅绿色的衣裳，温柔地为我们遮挡阳光。从暴烈的太阳下走进这一片清凉的绿荫，是不能不感谢留你歇息的主人的。到休息过来了，大家便仔细地拨开青草，在草根旁寻找从树上落下的红豆……
    在我们乡下，人们都叫红豆做相思豆。这小小的精致的种子，晶莹夺目，像凝聚在玻璃上的一滴鲜血，又像一颗小小的贞洁的心儿；它鲜红的颜色永不改变，又像难得相见的恋人们心中燃烧着的想念。大概就是因为这个缘故，所以不知道哪个绝顶聪明的人，才把这美丽的种子叫做相思豆，把这温柔的树叫做相思树的吧？
    人们想起红豆，往往忆起爱情；但在我的记忆中，红豆并不带着相思的滋味，它只使我怀念过去生活的艰辛，勾起遥远而又难以忘怀的不安的心绪——那时我还未看见共产主义的光芒，我的脚步还十分犹豫。深夜里，我在微弱的火油灯下读书，灯光只照一尺多远。灯盏是玻璃造的，我把几十颗红豆，放在灯盏里，透过火油和玻璃的晶体，红豆红得分外鲜明，这几乎是我在艰难的战争生活中难得的装饰。为此我也得感谢小山上的相思树。
    这都是很远很远的事了，但想来似乎又都很近。
    历史的风云在十多年间涌过了几个世纪，我终于带着万种感慨回到故乡。但这次回乡，却没有机会到相思树下去。我只是在新发现的矿区，爬上了几十公尺高的钻塔，向数十里外那长着相思树的小山眺望……我知道她们就在那里，她们一定比十多年前长得更丰盛，树下的青草也一定更浓更青，有更多快乐的孩子和年青人来拣拾红豆。但是我却看不见那座小山，它躲在云雾里了！空中的风，拂乱了我的头发，千万顷绿色的稻田，在眼底铺开；点点红白色的勘探队的旗子，插遍了辽阔的山野。这多少年代来兵匪如毛的土地，已经面目全新了。耸立在万绿丛中的钻塔，就像几只无形的巨手，提着一枝枝铁笔，在大地的史册上，为我的家乡编写着新的历史……
    眺望云雾迷蒙的远山，过去艰辛的年月的记忆，都涌上心头，我写下前面这首小诗，记念那默默地将快乐分给别人的相思树。
