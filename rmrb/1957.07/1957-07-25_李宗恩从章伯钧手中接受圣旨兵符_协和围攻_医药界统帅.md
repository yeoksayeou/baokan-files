    This newspaper reports: On the 22nd, the Rectification Leading Group of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Xiehe Medical College Branch to invite professors, associate professors, and relevant personnel from the college to expose and criticize the anti-socialist words and deeds of Li Zong'en, the president of Xiehe Medical College, director of the Xiehe Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and a rightist.

    Professor Hu Mao-hua, Director of the Department of Radiology, pointed out in his speech that Li Zong'en's organized and planned attack on the Party had historical roots. He came from a bureaucratic landlord family, received an education in British imperialism, and after returning to China, he threw himself into the arms of the Kuomintang and American imperialist elements. Before and after liberation, Li Zong'en did his utmost to preserve Xiehe as a stronghold for American imperialism, resisted the takeover by the People's Government, and even after the outbreak of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, Li Zong'en wrote to the American imperialist element Loucks, welcoming them back to China. He was so loyal to American imperialism, but he resisted the various social reforms and educational decrees of the People's Government. Before the People's Government took over Xiehe, he undermined the trade union, persecuted workers, expelled progressive elements, and shielded special agent students. From this, it can be seen that Zhang Bojun's appreciation of Li Zong'en was not accidental; they were like-minded and hit it off immediately. After Li Zong'en joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun wanted Li Zong'en to take command and usurp the leadership of the medical and health field. They made Li Zong'en a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party; even before he formally became one, Li attended meetings of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and participated in the Central Policy Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Due to Zhang Bojun's recommendation, Li Zong'en also served as a member of the Chinese People's Support Egypt Committee and a member of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission, and even attempted to become a vice minister of the Central Ministry of Health, working with Zhang Bojun to formulate an anti-socialist scientific program.

    Zhang Huilan, a teacher at the Xiehe Nursing School who was recruited into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party by Li Zong'en, revealed that after Xiehe started the rectification campaign, the Party Committee held a symposium for various democratic parties. The day before, Li Jian-sheng personally came to preside over the hasty establishment of the Xiehe Branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. At the founding meeting, some people suggested that if Party members and members of the Communist Youth League were group leaders in their rectification groups, everyone would be apprehensive about speaking out. Li Zong'en used this as an opportunity to demand that the Party Committee dismiss the Party member and CYL member group leaders, attempting to abolish the Party's leadership over the rectification movement. During the rectification campaign, Li Zong'en actively looked for opportunities to stir up trouble. When many symposiums were held on campus and everyone offered opinions, he still asked us to go separately to find out who else had concerns and had not fully expressed their opinions, attempting to add fuel to the fire and create emotions of dissatisfaction with the Party.

    Professor Li Hongjiong, Director of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, focused on exposing Li Zong'en's ugly activities in recruiting people for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He said: I myself was one of those who was recruited, but I was not pulled in. Their methods of recruiting people were extremely bad, using both soft and hard tactics. The soft method was to invite people to dinner and say that as long as they signed their names to join, they didn't have to come to meetings. If the soft approach didn't work, they would threaten, saying, "The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is the Communist Party's peripheral organization; joining it means you are progressive." The implication was that if you didn't join, you were reactionary. In order to achieve their goal of recruiting people, they even used deceptive means, telling Zhang San that Li Si had joined, and telling Li Si that Zhang San had joined. Li Hongjiong also said that Li Zong'en's recruitment area was also very wide, ranging from Guangdong in the south to Northeast China in the north.

    Professor Zhang Zuogan of the Department of Anatomy and Associate Professor Zhang Zhifen of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology both refuted Li Zong'en's fallacy of "having the title but no power." Zhang Zhifen said that when Li Zong'en was the president of Guiyang Medical College before liberation, he dared not touch personnel matters, could not move money, and the business was a mess. In the old Xiehe, he could not even talk about having the so-called three powers, but at that time, Li Zong'en was not heard to say that he had the title but no power; on the contrary, he worked very actively. After the government took over Xiehe, Li Zong'en remained in his original position as president with his original salary, responsible for teaching, medical treatment, scientific research, and administrative material supply. All budgets were compiled under his instructions, and all college expenses had to be approved by him before they could be spent. Departments had to obtain his approval for ordering books and instruments from abroad. Can this be said to be lacking financial power? Li Zong'en also had the power to preside over or participate in administrative meetings, academic meetings, teaching meetings, and medical meetings. Can this be said to be lacking personnel power and business power? But he adopted a negative attitude towards his work and was irresponsible. One of Xiehe's central tasks was scientific research. Li Zong'en was the director of Xiehe's Academic Committee, but he never put forward any suggestions for promoting academic research. The college's 1956 research work cards were sent to Li Zong'en for review, but he did not offer a single word of modification. No wonder Professor Lin Qiaozhi said: "If we want to examine bureaucracy, I think that in the entire college, President Li is the most detached from the masses. For several years, he has never consulted with us professors about the work of the school."

    Xiong Shiqi, a secretary in the Medical College Office, exposed Li Zong'en's two-faced tactics and his conspiracy to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, at a joint office meeting, Li Zong'en agreed not to give subsidies to intern students, but when the students raised objections, he pretended to be compassionate in front of the students, supporting the students' demands for subsidies, thereby sowing discord. Professor Deng Jiadong of the Department of Internal Medicine exposed that the essence of Li Zong'en's opposition to the takeover was opposition to the Party's leadership. He pointed out that Li Zong'en resisted the takeover by the Military Control Commission's Health Department and also opposed the leadership of the Central Ministry of Health. Some time ago, the central government proposed that Xiehe and the Academy of Medical Sciences and other units should adjust each other, and Li Zong'en is still passively resisting this to this day.

### 李宗恩从章伯钧手中接受圣旨兵符  协和围攻“医药界统帅”

    李宗恩从章伯钧手中接受圣旨兵符
    协和围攻“医药界统帅”
    本报讯　22日，农工民主党北京市委员会整风领导小组召开协和医学院支部扩大会议，邀请该院教授、副教授及有关人员参加，揭发和批判协和医学院院长、农工民主党协和支部主任委员、右派分子李宗恩的反社会主义言行。
    放射科主任胡懋华教授在发言中指出，李宗恩有组织、有计划地向党进攻，是有历史根源的。他出身于官僚地主家庭，受的是英帝国主义的教育，回国后又投靠了国民党和美帝国主义分子。解放前后，李宗恩极力为美帝国主义保存协和这个据点，抗拒人民政府的接管，一直到美帝国主义侵朝战争爆发，李宗恩还给美帝国主义分子娄克斯写信，欢迎他们重来中国。他对美帝国主义是这样的忠心，可是他对人民政府的各项社会改革、教育法令等却都有抵触情绪。人民政府接管协和前，他破坏工会，迫害工人，开除进步分子，包庇特务学生。由此看来，章伯钧所以器重李宗恩也不是偶然的，他们是志同道合，一拍即着。李宗恩加入农工民主党以后，章伯钧要李宗恩挂帅，篡夺医药卫生界的领导权。他们让李宗恩当农工民主党的中央委员，在没有正式当上以前，李就列席了农工中央执行局会议，并参加了农工中央政策委员会。由于章伯钧的推荐，李宗恩还担任了中国人民支援埃及委员会委员和国务院科学规划委员会委员，还企图当中央卫生部副部长，与章伯钧一起制定反社会主义的科学纲领。
    曾被李宗恩拉入农工民主党的协和护士学校教员张惠兰揭发李宗恩在协和开始整风以后，在党委召开各民主党派座谈会的前一天，李健生又亲自来主持，匆匆成立了农工党协和支部。在成立会上，有人提出他们整风小组里由党团员当小组长，大家发言有顾虑，李宗恩就借此要求党委撤销党团员小组长，企图取消党对整风运动的领导。李宗恩在整风期间积极地找机会点火，当校内开了很多座谈会，大家都提了意见的时候，他还要叫我们分头去找还有哪些人有顾虑没充分提意见，企图火上加油，制造对党不满的情绪。
    皮肤花柳科主任李洪?教授，着重地揭发了李宗恩为农工民主党拉人的丑恶活动。他说：我自己也是被拉的一个，但我没被拉进去。他们拉人的手段极其恶劣，软拉硬泡，软拉的办法是请人吃饭，并说只要签个字参加了，不来开会也行。软的不行，他们就进行威胁，说：“农工是共产党的外围组织，加入了就都是进步的”。言外之意，不加入你就是反动的。他们为了达到拉人的目的，甚至采用欺骗手段，拉张三时说：李四参加了，拉李四时又说：张三参加了；李洪?还说：李宗恩拉人的地区也很广泛，南起广东，北到东北。
    解剖科教授张作干和妇产科副教授张茞芬都驳斥了李宗恩“有职无权”的谬论。张茞芬说，解放前李宗恩在贵阳医学院当院长时，人事不敢碰，钱财不能动，业务搞得一塌糊涂。在旧协和的时候，他更谈不到有所谓三权，但是那时候没有听到李宗恩说过有职无权，反而工作得很积极。政府接管协和以后，李宗恩原职原薪当院长，负责教学、医疗、科学研究、行政物资供应等工作，一切预算都是在他的指示下编造的，全院经费要经过他批准后才能开支，各科系向国外订购图书仪器也要经他批准，这能说是没有财政权吗？李宗恩还有权主持或参加行政会议、学术会议、教学会议、医务会议等，这能说是没有人事权和事业权吗？但是他对工作却采取了消极的态度，不负责任。协和的中心任务之一是科学研究工作，李宗恩是协和学术委员会的主任委员，但是他对学术研究工作从没有提过任何推进工作的意见。全院1956年研究工作的卡片，送给李宗恩审阅，他没有提出只字的修改意见，难怪林巧稚教授说：“要检查官僚主义，我认为在全院中李院长是最脱离群众的。他几年来从没有找我们教授们商量商量学校的工作。”
    医学院办公室秘书熊士琦揭发了李宗恩以两面派的手法，借机挑拨党群关系的阴谋手段。如李宗恩在联合办公会上，同意不给实习学生发补助费，但当学生提出意见后，他又在学生面前装出一副悲天悯人的样子，支持学生要求补助，从中挑拨。内科教授邓家栋揭露了李宗恩反对接管的实质是反对党的领导。他指出，李宗恩反抗军委卫生部的接管，也反对中央卫生部领导。前些时中央提出协和与医学科学院等单位互相调整，李宗恩直到现在还在消极抵抗。
