Who are the True Inheritors of the "May Fourth" Spirit?
Wang Zisong, Associate Professor, Peking University

    Many comrades at Peking University have systematically exposed and criticized the right-wing elements centered around the reactionary small group "Plaza." Everyone can now clearly see their anti-communist and anti-socialist faces, their reactionary organizational activities, and their so-called strategies and theories.

    These right-wing elements describe their anti-socialist activities as inheriting the so-called democratic movement of the May Fourth Movement. They said: "This democratic movement is primarily a political movement of the masses, under the premise of supporting socialism, striving from the bottom up to expand socialist democracy." Now let's see what history has proven in these two months.

    First of all, it must be pointed out that the right-wing elements, under the banner of caring for the Party and helping the Party rectify its work style, claimed that they were active members in helping the Party rectify its work style, and that their activities were a "democratic movement" to help the Party rectify its work style. However, everyone still remembers that since the start of the rectification campaign at Peking University, starting in early May, the Party Committee convened expanded cadre meetings, and many veteran professors enthusiastically offered opinions to the Party. Among the students, since May 19th, although the first few big-character posters were put up by right-wing elements, in the two months since then, not only have there been various big-character posters numbering in the thousands among the students, but also various debates, report meetings, and ideological criticism meetings, and many publications and magazines have been published, starting a heated movement of ideological struggle. During these two months, various opinions can be divided into three categories according to their nature: 1. Offering opinions to the Party actively and in good faith to help the Party rectify its work style; 2. Right-wing elements rampantly attacking the Party; 3. Resolutely protecting the Party and socialism, and counterattacking the right-wing elements. Now let us analyze: The first category, these were the opinions expressed by the vast majority of students through big-character posters and forums at the beginning of the movement. Their attitude was well-intentioned, and the vast majority of their opinions were correct. Even if some of them were not completely in line with the facts, or even had some extreme emotions, their attitude was well-intentioned. The Party thanks them for their opinions, and will certainly listen humbly and improve the Party's work based on the correct opinions among them. This is the opinion of the vast majority of students, and this is part of the rectification movement. The second category is a small handful of right-wing elements who used the opportunity of the Party's rectification campaign to attack the Party. They pretended to be helping the Party rectify its work style, but in essence, they wanted to oppose the Party and undermine the Party's leadership. They used various slanders to smear the Party, saying that the Party's rule was worse than the Kuomintang's secret service organization, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and described the Party Central Committee as a completely dark and conservative group. They said that all Party members were elements of the "three evils," and were officials riding on the heads of the people, and that the active elements close to the Party were spies, opportunists, and people without conscience. Is this a sign of caring for the Party? In the inaugural issue of "Plaza," they themselves admitted that their activities had far exceeded the scope of the Party's internal rectification. Originally, their goal was to overthrow the Party and socialism. It was only because the Party and socialism were so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in our country that, under normal circumstances, this small handful of people could not openly spread such anti-communist and anti-socialist reactionary remarks. Therefore, they used the rectification movement to muddy the waters and achieve their reactionary goals. The third category mentioned above, after the Party put forward the need to counterattack the right-wing's anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks, the vast majority of students actively responded to the Party's call and counterattacked the right-wing. In this month, thanks to the active efforts of the broad masses of students, preliminary and great victories have been achieved.

    Right-wing elements attempted to use the rectification movement to achieve their anti-communist and anti-socialist goals. They are only a small handful of people, but they vainly attempted to include the activities of our vast number of students in their activities, to create confusion between good and bad, right and wrong. But we see very clearly that the vast majority of our students have stood on the side of the Party from beginning to end. At the beginning, they responded to the Party's call and helped the Party rectify its work style in good faith. Later, they actively responded to the Party's call and participated in the struggle to counterattack the right-wing. Therefore, the vast majority of our students stand on the side of loving the Party and loving socialism, which is in stark contrast to the anti-Party and anti-socialist attitude of this small handful of right-wing elements. We must resolutely distinguish and draw a clear line between ourselves and their reactionary anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

    Almost every right-wing element says that their own goal is to "fight for democracy," as if our new society, our Chinese Communist Party, does not give democracy to the people, so this small handful of people must come out to "fight for democracy," as if only they know more about democracy and love democracy more than the Communist Party and the broad masses of people. They dress themselves up as "democratic fighters" and heroes fighting for democracy. But what is the reality?

    We all remember that before liberation, in our country, only imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic comprador capitalists had democratic rights and freedom. At that time, the broad working class suffered oppression and exploitation and had no democracy or freedom; hundreds of millions of peasants suffered the cruel exploitation of landlords for life and death, and of course had no democracy; at that time, patriotic intellectuals also had no democracy, and the poet Wen Yiduo was assassinated by the Kuomintang reactionaries for fighting for democracy. At that time, young students had no democracy or freedom. As long as you advocated the truth, you were in danger of being followed by secret agents and disappearing. Concentration camps tortured our young students with cruel corporal punishment. Female students at Peking University could be arbitrarily raped by American soldiers, and the vast number of students often struggled on the verge of starvation and were in constant danger of dropping out of school. Therefore, we were forced to raise the banner of fighting for democracy and opposing persecution again and again to fight against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Countless young students shed sweat and blood. At that time, due to the collusion and oppression of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, even the patriotic national bourgeoisie had no democracy. Therefore, at that time, only a small handful of reactionaries had democracy and freedom, while the broad masses of people had no democracy or freedom. After the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people in more than 30 years of revolutionary struggle and achieved victory, the Chinese people truly stood up and gained true democratic freedom. Now the situation has completely changed. Hundreds of millions of peasants have broken free from thousands of years of oppression, the working class has thrown off the mountains on their backs, and has gained true freedom. All patriotic intellectuals and democrats have also gained true freedom, and young students are learning and living freely and happily. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a people's democratic system has been established, and 600 million people have truly stood up as masters of their own destiny.

    Of course, there are some people to whom we cannot give democracy. These are counter-revolutionaries, the overthrown landlord class, and other reactionary elements. We cannot give them "democracy." There are also some people who have anti-socialist remarks and actions, and we cannot give them "democracy" either, because this is contrary to the interests of the broad masses of people. If we give them "democracy," that is to give the broad masses of people undemocratic treatment. This principle is very clear. Therefore, in our society, the vast majority of the people enjoy true democracy and freedom, and only a small number of reactionary elements have no "democracy." This is very clear and completely reasonable.

    But this small handful of right-wing elements keep saying that our new society is undemocratic, and that this society suppresses their democracy. Why is this? Originally, this small handful of right-wing elements mostly came from landlord, Kuomintang bureaucrat warlord, and capitalist families. Some are reactionary classes that have already been eliminated, and some are declining classes that are being eliminated. Many of their close relatives, their fathers, brothers, and relatives, have been suppressed, criticized, and struggled against in previous social reform movements. Many of them have had consistent reactionary remarks and behaviors since liberation, and they have always harbored hatred towards socialism. Is it any wonder that such people feel that this society is undemocratic? Why should we give such people full democracy?

    From the class origins and past history of these right-wing elements among the students of Peking University, and more importantly, from their current thoughts, feelings, remarks, and actions, it can be seen that they are standing on the position of the landlords, reactionaries, and all the declining classes that are being eliminated, and have a deep hatred for the Party and socialism. The democracy they want to fight for is nothing more than fighting for democracy for these declining and dying classes against us. That is why they think this society is not democratic enough and that they are being suffocated. This is the essence of their so-called "democratic movement."

    Of course, the exploiting classes, especially the classes that have already died out, never dare to make their own views public. They always use various masks to disguise themselves. But the fox's tail cannot be hidden after all.

    The right-wing element Long Yinghua said that landlords should be given the right to vote. It turns out that he is fighting for democracy for the landlords. He also said that as long as capitalists are stripped of their labels, socialist democracy will be expanded. It turns out that Long Yinghua's demand for expanding democracy is simply to count capitalists who are still receiving fixed interest, that is, still exploiting workers, as non-exploiters. Liu Qidi described the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng as a "loyal minister" and a "virtuous person." He wants to speak up for him. It turns out that what they are fighting for is to give counter-revolutionaries freedom and democracy. Tan Tianrong said that our current struggle against right-wingers is "an attack by elements of the 'three evils' on democrats." It turns out that the "democrats" they are talking about are these right-wing elements inside and outside the school. No wonder Yan Zhongqiang wants to describe the right-wing as the "left" wing. From a revolutionary standpoint, revolution is the left wing and reaction is the right wing. From a reactionary standpoint, revolution is the right wing and reaction is the left wing. It is not surprising that the anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements are seen as democrats in their eyes.

    We can now see very clearly that the democracy that this small handful of people wants to fight for is to fight for democracy for the landlord class that has already died, to fight for democracy for the reactionary faction of the bourgeoisie that is being eliminated, to fight for democracy for the counter-revolutionaries, to fight for democracy for imperialism against us, and to fight for democracy for their reactionary thoughts and reactionary remarks. Because they are colluding with right-wing elements in society and are being used by those people, we can see that they are also fighting for democracy for the reactionary right-wing elements Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Shaohong, and Tan Tiwu, and fighting for their leadership. This is the democracy they want to fight for, this is the reactionary, declining class's anti-communist, anti-socialist democracy. In this way, we can see that the class essence of the democracy that the right-wing elements centered around "Plaza" want to fight for is such.

    Due to the difference between their class position and ours, in their view, capitalist countries are more democratic than us. Jiang Xingren said: "The democracy in the United States and Britain has full discussion and competition, and debates and votes of no confidence are true democracy," while slandering our democracy as "formalistic democracy." They even sing the tune that our socialism is economically democratic but politically undemocratic. We know that this is a clichéd tune that has been sung for decades. From the reactionary Hu Shi to those who took the third road before liberation, like the current right-wing elements Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and Qian Duansheng, they have all sung this tune, and they have all gone bankrupt in front of the Chinese people. Do the American people really have democracy? The broad masses of the American people demanded an end to hydrogen bomb tests, and the broad masses of the American people opposed Dulles's policy towards China. Have these people's wills been realized? Do the British people have democracy? When Eden dragged them into the war of aggression against Egypt, although the British people opposed it, was their will realized? Our Party and government widely solicit the opinions of the people and obtain their consent when deciding on every major policy. Which one is formal democracy? Which one is fake democracy, and which one is true democracy?

    Declining classes always try to disguise their true purposes in various ways. One of the most confusing methods of the right-wing elements centered around "Plaza" is that they say that there is not enough democracy now and that it needs to be expanded into so-called "true democracy," that is, so-called absolute democracy. According to them, in such a democracy, everyone's personality can be freely developed without restraint. Anyone can do whatever they want without any restrictions.

    In a society, when people live and work together, they must make some of the individual's interests subordinate to the collective's interests, and there must inevitably be a relationship of leadership and being led, and it is inevitable to be restricted. This will certainly be the case in a society where classes have been completely eliminated in the future, let alone when classes have not been completely eliminated now, it is even more impossible to have such "democracy." This is a petty-bourgeois anarchist utopia. Because it caters to the psychology of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, it can confuse some young students who have no practical experience in struggle. Therefore, all revisionists use the slogan of absolute democracy. They oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, oppose democracy with centralized leadership, and oppose democracy that is dictatorial towards the enemy. The reactionary nature of this revisionism is very obvious.

    Do these people who demand the liberation of individuality and demand that everyone have full democratic freedom really advocate such democracy? This can be known by looking at their actions in the past two months. Actions are the best proof of whether a person is lying. Let us give a few examples. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, they shouted loudly and scolded everyone who had different opinions as dogmatism. Tan Tianrong scolded everyone else as idiots. When they start a debate, if they are in charge of the meeting, they will never let people who disagree with them speak, and even let their own people sit in front of the stage and withhold the slips of paper of others who want to speak, in order to control the meeting. When it is their turn to speak, they do not abide by any rules, scold people at will, prolong the time, and disrupt the meeting. When they are finished speaking, they immediately leave the meeting when others criticize them. Is there any democratic style here? They demand democracy, but their own actions are not democratic. As for beating people, scolding people, stealing, obstructing public order, etc., everyone knows. What kind of democracy is this? Is this the behavior of a so-called "democratic fighter"? Can we smell any democratic atmosphere here?

    A person's behavior is the best judgment of him. These people are really the true enemies of democracy. They are the scum of society and the dregs of youth.

    From this, it can be seen that although some young students have been fooled by them, thinking that their motives are good and that they are fighting for a better social system. When everyone sees through it, it is nothing more than a deceptive trick for them. The absolute democracy they talk about is nothing more than a trick to confuse people by using the petty-bourgeois psychology of young students. Isn't it clear? What they want to fight for is, as mentioned above, the democracy of counter-revolutionaries, landlords, capitalists, and arrogant and ambitious individualists, the anti-communist and anti-socialist democracy. How can he fight for democracy for the broad masses of the people?

    This is the true face of their so-called "democratic movement."

    The right-wing elements say that they are inheriting the May Fourth spirit. This is the most shameless slander of the May Fourth Movement.

    Everyone knows that the May Fourth Movement was a revolutionary movement to transform the poor and backward old China into a prosperous and strong new China, a revolutionary enlightenment movement. Although the May Fourth Movement was initiated by intellectuals and young students, later facts have proven that only by accepting Marxism, integrating with the workers and peasants, using proletarian ideology to transform themselves, and taking the socialist road can intellectuals achieve the goal of saving China. This is the spirit and tradition of the May Fourth Movement. In the forty years since the May Fourth Movement, generations of young students have struggled for this goal and shed blood and sweat. Now we have teachers of various ages in our school who have participated in student movements in various periods, but the common conclusion we have come to is only one: only by following the Communist Party can we build a new China. This is the only broad road.

    I finally tell these right-wing elements that in China, the bourgeoisie has never led a democratic movement. The banner of the democratic movement has always been held high by the Chinese working class represented by the Chinese Communist Party. Anyone who wants to usurp this banner will inevitably only be battered and bruised and perish.

    Dear young students, only young people who love socialism and love the Chinese Communist Party are the true inheritors of the May Fourth spirit. In this struggle to counterattack the right-wing, the vast majority of our young students can stand firm, resolutely defend our Party and our socialist cause, and resolutely fight against these anti-communist and anti-socialist right-wing elements. The facts have proven that the vast majority of our young students can withstand the test of class struggle. They are worthy of their predecessors and worthy of the predecessors of student movements in various periods! Therefore, only they are the true inheritors of the May Fourth spirit.

    The struggle against the right-wing has only achieved preliminary victory, and we must continue to move forward! Right-wing elements are not democratic fighters, but enemies of democracy. In the past two months, we have seen very clearly: who is hindering the smooth progress of our Party's rectification movement, and who is hindering the continued expansion of our democratic life? It is no one else but these right-wing elements, precisely the remarks and actions of these anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements. For the sake of democracy and our socialist cause, let us continue to struggle and continue to move forward! Let us resolutely unite around the Party and move forward!

    谁是“五四”精神的真正继承者？
    北京大学副教授　汪子嵩
    北京大学许多同志对以反动小集团“广场”为中心的右派分子进行了系统的揭发和批判，大家已经可以看清楚他们的反共反社会主义的面目，他们的反动组织活动，以及他们的所谓策略和理论。
    这些右派分子把他们的反社会主义的活动说成是继承五四运动的所谓民主运动。他们说：“这次民主运动，主要是一次群众在拥护社会主义的前提下，自下而上地争取扩大社会主义民主的政治运动。”我们现在来看看，经过这两个月时间，历史究竟证明了些什么东西呢？
    首先要指出，右派分子打着爱护党、帮助党整风的旗子，说他们自己是帮助党整风的积极分子，说他们的活动是帮助党整风的“民主运动”。然而，大家都还记得，北京大学从整风开始以来，5月初起党委会召开扩大干部会，许多老教授热烈地对党提出意见。在同学里面，从5月19日开始，最初的几张大字报虽然是右派分子贴的，但从此以后，这两个月来，在同学里面，不但有各种各样数以千百计的大字报，也举行了各种各样的辩论会、报告会与思想批判会，也出版了许多刊物杂志，开始了一个热烈的思想斗争的运动。在这两个月里，各种意见按其性质可以分为三种：一、积极善意对党提出意见，帮助党整风；二、右派分子猖狂向党进攻；三、坚决保护党和社会主义，向右派反击。现在我们分析一下：第一类，这是运动开始时极大多数同学通过大字报与座谈会所发表的意见。他们的态度是善意的，他们的意见极大多数是正确的，纵然有一些不完全符合事实，甚或有些偏激情绪，但他们的态度是善意的，党感谢他们提出的意见，一定虚心听取，并且根据其中正确的意见来改进党的工作。这是极大多数同学的意见，这是整风运动的一部分。第二类，是一小撮右派分子利用党整风的机会，向党进攻。他们表面上说是帮助党整风，实质上却是想反对党，搞垮党的领导。他们用各种谩骂污蔑党，说党统治得比国民党特务机关中美合作所还坏，把党中央描写成漆黑一团，变成保守分子把持的集团。他们把党员都说成是三害分子，是骑在人民头上的老爷，把靠近党的积极分子说成是特务、投机分子，没有良心的人。这难道是爱护党的表示吗？他们在“广场”发刊辞上自己也承认他们的活动已远远超出了党内整风的范围。原来他们的目的是要推翻党和社会主义。只是因为党和社会主义在我们国家里如此深入人心，在平时，他们这一小撮人是不能公开来散布这种反共反社会主义的反动言论的，因此他们利用整风运动来混水摸鱼，达到他们的反动目的。上面所说的第三类，那是在党提出了向右派反共反社会主义言论进行反击之后，极大多数同学积极响应党的号召，反击右派，在这一个多月的时间里，由于广大同学积极努力，已经取得了初步的伟大的胜利。
    右派分子企图利用整风运动来达到他们反共反社会主义的目的。他们只是一小撮人，但是他们却妄想将我们广大同学的活动都包括到他们的活动里面去，来一个好的坏的混淆不清，是非不明。但是我们看得很清楚，我们极大多数同学自始至终站在党的一边，开始时响应党的号召，善意地帮助党整风，后来又积极响应党的号召，参加反击右派的斗争，所以我们极大多数同学都站在热爱党热爱社会主义的一边，与他们这一小撮右派分子反党反社会主义的态度正是截然相反的。我们必须与他们反党反社会主义的反动活动坚决区别开来，划清界限。
    几乎每一个右派分子都说他们自己的目的是为了“争取民主”，好像我们的新社会，我们的中国共产党并不给人民民主，所以要他们这一小撮人出来“争取民主”，好像只有他们才比共产党，比广大的人民群众更懂得民主，更热爱民主。他们把自己打扮成为“民主战士”，争民主的英雄。可是事实究竟是怎么样呢？
    我们大家都还记得，解放以前，在我们的国家里，只有帝国主义、封建地主和官僚买办阶级，是有民主权利的，是有自由的。那时候广大的工人阶级受尽压迫与剥削，没有民主和自由；几万万农民生生死死受着地主的残酷剥削，当然没有民主；那时候，爱国的知识分子也没有民主，诗人闻一多就是为了争取民主，而被国民党反动派所暗杀。那时候的青年学生没有一点民主与自由，只要你主张真理，你就有被特务跟踪，就有失踪的危险，集中营里用残酷肉刑折磨着我们青年同学，北大女同学可以被美国兵任意强奸，广大的同学经常挣扎在饥饿线上，时时有失学的危险，因此我们被迫一次又一次地举起争民主、反迫害的旗子来与国民党反动派斗争，无数青年同学流了汗，流了血。那时候，由于美帝国主义与蒋介石反动派勾结压迫，甚至连爱国的民族资产阶级也没有民主。所以那时候，只有一小撮反动分子有民主有自由，而广大的人民群众没有民主，没有
  自由。经过中国共产党领导中国人民进行了三十多年的革命斗争，取得胜利，中国人民才真正翻了身，才取得真正的民主自由，现在情况已经完全改变过来。几亿农民挣脱了几千年的压迫，工人阶级摆脱了压在身上的几座大山，取得了真正的自由，一切爱国的知识分子与民主人士也才取得真正的自由，青年学生自由地、幸福地学习和生活着。在中国共产党领导之下，建立了人民民主制度，六亿人民真正翻身作了主人。
    当然，对于有一些人，我们不能给他们民主。这就是反革命分子，被打倒的地主阶级和其他反动分子，我们不能给他们“民主”，还有些人有反对社会主义的言论与行动，我们也不能给他们“民主”，因为这是和广大的人民利益相违背的，如果给他们以“民主”，那就是给广大的人民群众以不民主，这道理是很清楚的。所以在我们的社会里，极大多数人民享受了真正的民主与自由，只有少数反动分子没有“民主”，这原是很清楚的，也是完全合理的。
    但是这一小撮右派分子，却口口声声说我们的新社会是不民主的，说这个社会压制了他们的民主。这又是为什么呢？原来这一小撮右派分子，他们大都出身于地主、国民党官僚军阀、资本家家庭，有些是已经被消灭了的反动阶级，有些是正在被消灭的没落阶级，他们的许多近亲，他们的父亲、哥哥和亲属，在历次社会改革运动中被镇压、被批判、被斗争过，他们自己，很多在解放以来都有一贯的反动言论和行为，他们对社会主义原来是一直心怀仇恨。这样的人，他们感到这个社会不民主，这又有什么奇怪呢？我们为什么要给这样的人以充分民主呢？
    从北京大学学生中，这些右派分子的阶级出身、过去历史，更主要的是他们现在的思想、感情、言论与行动，可以看出他们是站在地主、反动派以及正在被消灭的一切没落阶级的立场上，对党与社会主义有深切的仇恨，他们所谓要争的民主，不过是要为这些没落的、死亡的阶级来向我们争民主，所以他们才会想到这个社会民主不够，他们被窒息了。这就是他们所谓“民主运动”的实质。
    当然，剥削阶级，特别是已经死亡的阶级，从来不敢把他们自己的观点公开出来。他们总是用各种各样的假面具来掩饰着。但是狐狸尾巴终究是藏不住的。
    右派分子龙英华说，要给地主以选举权，原来他是为地主争民主。他又说，只要给资本家摘掉帽子，那么社会主义民主就扩大了。原来只要将现在还在拿定息即还在剥削工人的资本家算作不是剥削，就是龙英华所要求的扩大民主。刘奇弟把反革命分子胡风说成是“忠臣”，是“贤良”，他要为他喊冤，原来他们所争取的就是给反革命分子以自由以民主。谭天荣说，我们现在的反右派斗争是“三害分子向民主分子的进攻”，原来他们所说的“民主分子”就是校内外这些右派分子。怪不得严仲强要把右派说成“左”派。站在革命的立场上看，革命是左派，反动是右派，站到反动的立场上看，革命就是右派，反动反是左派，反党反社会主义的右派分子，在他们看来就是民主分子，这又有什么奇怪呢？
    我们现在可以看得很清楚，原来这一小撮人所要争取的民主，是为已经死亡的地主阶级争民主，是为正在消灭的资产阶级反动派争民主，是为反革命争民主，是为帝国主义向我们争民主，是为他们的反动思想，反动言论争民主。因为他们是与社会上右派分子有所勾结，并且为那些人所利用的，所以我们可以看到，原来他们还在为反动的右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑、谭惕吾之流争民主，为他们争领导权。这就是他们所要争取的民主，这就是反动、没落阶级反共、反社会主义的民主。这样我们可以看到：以“广场”为中心的右派分子所要争取的民主的阶级实质就是如此。
    由于他们的阶级立场和我们的不同，在他们看来，资本主义国家比我们更民主。蒋兴仁说：“美国、英国民主有充分讨论竞争，有辩论与不信任票是真民主”，而污蔑我们的民主是“形式主义的民主”。他们甚至也唱起，我们的社会主义是经济上民主，而政治上不民主这样的调子。我们知道这是早已唱了几十年的陈词滥调，从反动派胡适起一直到解放前走第三条道路的人，像现在的右派分子罗隆基、储安平、钱端升都早已唱过这调子，在中国人民面前也都早已破产了。美国人民真的有民主么？广大的美国人民要求停止氢弹试验，广大的美国人民反对杜勒斯的对华政策，这些人民的意志实现了没有？英国人民有民主吗？当艾登将他们拖向侵略埃及的战争时，尽管英国人民反对，可是他们的意志实现了没有？我们的党和政府在决定每一个重大的政策时，都广泛地征求人民的意见，取得人民同意的。究竟那一个是形式的民主？那一个是假民主，那一个才是真民主呢？
    没落阶级总是多方设法掩饰他们的真正目的的。以“广场”为中心的右派分子一个最迷惑人的手法，就是他们说现在民主不够，要扩大成为所谓“真正的民主”，也就是所谓绝对的民主。照他们说来，在那样的民主里，任何人的个性都可以自由发展，不受拘束。任何人想做什么就可以做什么，丝毫不受限制。
    在一个社会里，人与人共同生活，共同劳作，就一定要让个人的一些利益服从集体的利益，就一定免不了有领导与被领导的关系，就免不了要受限制。在将来阶级完全消灭了的社会里，也一定如此，更何况现在阶级还没有完全消灭的时候，更不可能有这样的“民主”。这是小资产阶级无政府主义的空想。因为它投合小资产阶级知识分子的心理，所以能迷惑一部分没有实际斗争经验的青年学生，所以一切修正主义者都运用绝对民主的口号，他们反对无产阶级专政，反对有集中领导的民主，反对对敌人专政的民主。这种修正主义的反动性是很明显的。
    这些口口声声要求个性解放，要求每个人都有充分民主自由的人，究竟是不是主张真的这样的民主？这只要看他们这两个月来的行动就可以知道，一个人是否说谎话，行动是最好的证明。我们举几个例子，整风开始，他们大喊大叫，凡是与他们有不同意见的，一概骂为教条主义，谭天荣把别人都骂成白痴。开起辩论会来，如果由他们主持会议，他们就决不让与他们意见不同的人发言，甚至让自己的人坐在台前，扣留别人要求发言的条子，以此来控制会场。轮到他们发言时，什么规则都不遵守，随便骂人，拉长时间，捣乱会场。自己说完话，别人提出批评时，他们马上退出会场。这里有丝毫民主作风吗？他们要求民主，而他们自己的行动，却并不民主。至于打人骂人，偷窃、妨碍公共秩序等，都是大家知道的。这是什么民主啊？这是所谓“民主战士”的行为吗？从这里我们能嗅得出一些民主气息吗？
    一个人的行为是对于他最好的判断。他们这些人实在才是真正的民主的敌人。他们是社会上的渣滓，是青年中的败类。
    由此可见，虽然有些青年同学上了他们的当，以为他们的动机是好的，是为了争取更美好的社会制度。大家说穿了，还不过是他们骗人的幌子。他们所说的绝对民主，不过是利用青年同学小资产阶级心理来迷惑人的幌子，难道还不清楚吗？他们所要争取的不过是像上面所说，是反革命、地主、资本家以及狂妄自大的个人主义野心家的民主，是反共反社会主义的民主，他那里是为广大人民群众争民主呢？
    这就是他们所谓“民主运动”的真正面目。
    右派分子们说，他们是继承五四精神的，这是对于五四运动最无耻的污蔑。
    谁都知道，五四运动是一次革命运动，是要将贫穷落后的旧中国转变为康乐富强的新中国的一次革命的启蒙运动。五四运动虽然是知识分子、青年学生发起的，但后来的事实证明了，知识分子只有接受马克思主义，与工农大众相结合，用无产阶级思想来改造自己，走社会主义的道路，才能达到救中国的目的。这就是五四的精神与传统。五四以后四十年来，一代代青年学生都为这个目标而奋斗，流过血与汗。现在我们学校里有各个不同年龄的教师，他们参加过各个不同时期的学生运动，但是我们摸索出来的共同结论只有一条：只有跟着共产党走，才能建设新中国。这是一条唯一的康庄大道。
    我最后告诉这些右派分子们，在中国，资产阶级从来没有领导过民主运动，民主运动大旗是一直由以中国共产党为代表的中国工人阶级高举着的，谁要想来篡夺这面大旗，必然只能是碰得头破血流，自取灭亡。
    亲爱的青年同学们，只有热爱社会主义和热爱中国共产党的青年，才是五四精神真正的继承者。在这次反击右派的斗争中，我们极大多数青年同学，都能站稳立场，坚决保卫我们的党和我们的社会主义事业，坚决与这些反共反社会主义的右派分子作斗争，事实证明了我们极大多数的青年同学是经得起阶级斗争的考验的。他们无愧于他们的前辈，无愧于历次学生运动的前辈！所以只有他们才是五四精神的真正继承者。
    反右派斗争还只取得了初步胜利，我们还要继续前进！右派分子不但不是民主的战士，而是民主的敌人。这两个月来，我们看得很清楚：是谁阻碍了我们党的整风运动顺利前进，是谁阻碍了我们民主生活继续扩大？不是别人，正就是这些右派分子，正就是这些反党反社会主义的右派分子的言论与行动。为了民主，为了我们的社会主义事业，让我们继续奋斗，继续前进吧！让我们坚决地团结在党的周围，迈步前进！
