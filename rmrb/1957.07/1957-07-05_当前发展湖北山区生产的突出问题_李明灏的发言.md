I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports of the conference.

Last winter and this spring, in April and May, I visited more than a dozen counties in the mountainous areas of northwestern and western Hubei to inspect work and had more contact with cadres and people in the mountainous areas. I personally felt that I had increased a lot of knowledge and benefited a lot. Now I would like to express some opinions on what I have seen and heard in the mountainous areas of Hubei and what I have personally thought about.

  Life is Much Better Than Before Liberation
  But Still Much Worse Than in Plain Areas

In the past few years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, Hubei Province has made achievements in its work in mountainous areas. Through a series of great mass movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, all kinds of reactionary forces that had long been pressing down on the people in the mountainous areas were completely overthrown. The people were liberated, production developed, and their lives were greatly improved. Now, agricultural cooperativization has been realized in the mountainous areas, and agricultural cooperatives are generally doing well. After a period of efforts, I believe they can be done even better. On the basis of agricultural cooperativization, the development of production and the improvement of people's lives in mountainous areas will have even more reliance. 1956 was the first year of agricultural cooperativization. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas increased production. In the eight counties of Enshi Prefecture, grain production in 1956 increased by 17% compared with 1955, and the income of the vast majority of cooperative members increased. In Zhushan County, Xiangyang Prefecture, the average grain per person in 1952 was 434 jin, and in 1956 it was 558 jin, an increase of 28%.

The lives of people in mountainous areas have indeed improved greatly compared with before liberation. Before liberation, the people in mountainous areas lived a life worse than cattle and horses. They couldn't get enough to eat or wear. Many farmers lacked food, and they relied on digging bracken roots and wild vegetables for several months every year. "Chili peppers as salt, and 'huo zha' (rotten tofu in some places) for the New Year." This was indeed the actual life situation of the people in mountainous areas at that time. Now, the vast majority of people have grain to eat, and very few people eat bracken roots and wild vegetables. In the past, most farmers in mountainous areas did not have cotton clothes or quilts. When winter came, they could only sit indoors and warm themselves by the fire. Because of the high mountains, cold weather, and lack of food and clothing, many farmers suffered from asthma (severe bronchitis). A few people didn't even have a single piece of clothing. It was not uncommon for big girls of seventeen or eighteen to have no pants to wear. Now this situation has changed greatly. Every family has quilts to cover themselves, and only a small number of people in the large mountainous areas have no cotton clothes to wear. The sales volume of cloth increased from an average of eight chi per person per year in 1952 to twenty-six chi per person in 1956. Most farmers slaughtered New Year pigs. The people in mountainous areas are satisfied with these aspects. When I held a discussion with old farmers in Laifeng County, several old farmers mentioned that they had been captured as soldiers, forced laborers, imprisoned, and even beheaded by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the past, which caused his son to not return home until now, making them cry and unable to speak. Some even cried several times, which moved me very much.

Although the lives of people in mountainous areas have improved greatly in the past few years, they are still far behind the plain areas. At present, the lives of people in mountainous areas are still relatively hard, and the living standards are still low. Especially in large mountainous areas, there are still many difficulties that cannot be solved for a while. It is understood that the average income per farmer in the entire Enshi Prefecture in 1956 was only about 40 yuan. In many large high mountains, the average annual income per person was less than 30 yuan, which is more than half lower than that in the plain areas. Therefore, we must make the greatest efforts to lead and help the people in mountainous areas to vigorously develop production and gradually change this poor and backward situation.

How to develop production and improve the lives of people in mountainous areas? Based on my personal observation and understanding, I believe that we must pay attention to gradually solving the following problems:

  Prioritize Grain Production
  Develop Diversified Economy

The fundamental way to change the face of mountainous areas is to develop production. Not long ago, the People's Daily published an editorial on "Overall Planning and Construction of Mountainous Areas," and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a special conference on work in mountainous areas in December last year to study the principles for developing production in mountainous areas. I believe these are very important and timely. Based on my personal experience, the most prominent issue in developing production in mountainous areas is how to comprehensively and rationally arrange grain production and the development of a diversified economy. The output and potential for increasing production of various economic crops in the mountainous areas of Hubei, such as tea, hemp, tung oil, lacquer, medicinal materials, fruit trees, and forestry, are very large. We must strengthen leadership and vigorously develop them. However, based on the current economic characteristics of mountainous areas, I believe that the development of a diversified economy must be closely combined with grain production. Without the growth of grain production, the development of a diversified economy will have no reliable foundation and guarantee. At present, the grain situation in mountainous areas is relatively tight in some areas, and there is a phenomenon of neglecting grain production in individual places. With the growth of population, the increase in people's consumption, and the development of animal husbandry, it can be affirmed that grain will still be a very important issue in mountainous areas for a considerable period of time. Therefore, in mountainous areas, we must resolutely implement the policy of prioritizing the development of grain production. On the premise of ensuring that there is enough grain to eat and surplus, we must comprehensively plan and vigorously develop a diversified economy. As far as I know, in the arrangement of grain and a diversified economy, the phenomenon of neglecting one or the other often occurs in many places, which affects production. Of course, in implementing this policy, we must also prevent the bias of subjectivism and not proceeding from objective circumstances and not taking into account regional characteristics. In the specific policies such as closing mountains for afforestation, soil and water conservation, and handling rotation land, we must adapt to local conditions and not mechanically copy.

There are many favorable conditions for developing agricultural production in mountainous areas, but there are also many difficulties, especially the difficulty of insufficient labor force is more prominent. Secondly, there are also many natural disasters, including water, drought, insects, hail, and beasts. In particular, the threat of beasts is very large, and sometimes even endangers human lives. Farmers circulated a ballad: "Planting crops every year, beasts spoil them all. If it's good, there is half, if it's bad, nothing is seen." It can be seen how great the harm is. With the development of afforestation in mountainous areas, the threat of wild animals to the production and life of people in mountainous areas will increase day by day. Therefore, we must pay attention to relying on the strength of the masses, summarizing the experience of the masses in capturing and preventing them, and hope that relevant departments will provide support in the research and supply of gunpowder and tools.

  Gradually Build Highways Between Towns
  Build the Sichuan-Han Railway as Soon as Possible

The biggest difficulty for people in mountainous areas is inconvenient transportation. The transportation problem is one of the key issues in developing production and improving the lives of people in mountainous areas. Facts have proved that where roads are built, the economic situation changes immediately. Jiantianba Township in Enshi County is a timber production area. In the past, timber was worthless due to the lack of roads. It was left to fend for itself. In 1955, when the road was built, timber became valuable. Last year, one cooperative in the township earned more than 30,000 yuan from timber alone, accounting for more than 50% of the total income of the entire cooperative. The income of the masses has increased, and the enthusiasm for afforestation has also greatly increased. The mountainous areas of Hubei have a large number of various material resources such as timber, coal, iron, sulfur, tung oil, raw lacquer, tea, ramie, animal products, and medicinal materials. Due to transportation difficulties, they cannot be transported out, which is a great loss to the country and the people.

Solving the transportation problem in mountainous areas is a very urgent and arduous task, and it must be solved in a planned, gradual, and active manner. I personally believe that first, we must organize and lead the full use of the potential of various folk transportation tools in mountainous areas, and gradually build various sidewalks and mule trails in a planned manner. In particular, we must emphasize the development of animal power transportation. The masses already have experience, and it can be opened up as long as it is organized and promoted.

Secondly, we must gradually build highways between important towns and major material distribution centers, first building simple roads and gradually improving them after traffic is open. We must make full use of all available rivers and waterways and renovate and dredge them. This task is very arduous, and it is very difficult to rely solely on local forces. It is recommended that relevant departments of the Central Government provide necessary support to local areas for transportation issues in mountainous areas. In addition, according to surveys, the Enshi area of ​​Hubei has a large number of coal and iron deposits (preliminary surveys show that the reserves of Jian'shi iron ore are more than 600 million tons) and forest resources (the accumulated volume of mature forests is about 12 million cubic meters), and the number of various local specialties is also very large. It is recommended that the Central Government build the Sichuan-Han Railway as soon as possible, and pass through Enshi and enter Sichuan.

Third, in the past few years, medical and health services in mountainous areas have made great progress, but there is still a great distance compared with the demands of the masses. Due to economic and cultural backwardness, many people in mountainous areas suffer from infectious diseases, such as syphilis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, asthma, and eye diseases, which pose a great threat to people's health and agricultural production. Judging from the current situation, local medical institutions do not have enough strength to treat these diseases, and there are not many methods. We should study how to strengthen the work in this area.

  Adjust Purchase Prices of Grain and Timber
  Establish Tujia Autonomous Region

From the mountainous areas I have visited, commercial work is generally done very well. In particular, the increase in the purchase price of tung oil and lacquer last year and the reduction in the price of low-grade industrial products and edible salt have played a great role in developing production and improving people's lives in mountainous areas. At present, the problem is that the purchase price of grain and timber is a bit low. It is understood that before the Anti-Japanese War, one hundred jin of rice could be exchanged for twenty-four chi of white fine cloth, but now it can only be exchanged for fourteen chi and nine inches; the price of fir wood is six yuan to six yuan and five jiao per cubic meter, and the price of pine wood is four yuan per cubic meter. If it is split into firewood for sale, it can be sold for twelve yuan. Therefore, forest farmers reported that it is even lower than the price of firewood. Secondly, there is the problem of price arrangements between provinces, which has not been well resolved in the past few years. For example, gallnuts are 21 yuan and 6 jiao per dan in Laifeng County, but only a river away in Longshan, Hunan, they are priced at 26 yuan and 5 jiao per dan. Raw lacquer is 146 yuan and 2 jiao per dan in Laifeng County, but 185 yuan per dan in Longshan. The masses have great opinions. In Laifeng County, 46 out of 75 commodities are higher than the prices in Sichuan, 7 are lower than the prices in Sichuan, and only 22 are basically the same. These problems need to be studied by our province and relevant departments of the Central Government and dealt with as soon as possible.

There are more than 150,000 ethnic minorities in Hubei Province, and there are a considerable number of ethnic minority settlements in some mountainous areas. For example, the Tujia people in Laifeng and Hefeng counties are estimated to be more than 100,000 people. In the past, we did not do enough work in this area. I myself was in charge of this work, but I did not understand the situation enough and did not grasp the work tightly enough. I should bear the main responsibility. We should strengthen the work of ethnic minorities in this area. First of all, we should pay attention to training cadres and paying attention to providing ethnic minorities with care and assistance in political, economic, and cultural aspects. After a period of work, the ethnic minority autonomous region will be established. Hubei Province has now sent special personnel to conduct investigations and research, and on the basis of investigations and research, formulate an ethnic minority autonomous region plan to strengthen the work of ethnic minorities. In this regard, I also hope that the Central Government will give us more help and support.

The above are some of the main problems I have seen in the work of mountainous areas in Hubei. I think that some of the situations and problems may also exist in other areas. I have briefly raised them for the reference of the Central Government and all representatives and hope for criticism and correction.

    当前发展湖北山区生产的突出问题
    李明灏的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。
    去年冬季和今春四、五月间，我曾经先后到过鄂西北和鄂西山区的十几个县视察工作，与山区干部和人民有了较多的接触，个人感到增加了不少的见识，受益非浅。现在我仅就我在湖北山区所见所闻和个人所想到的一些问题，发表一点意见。
  生活比解放前有很大提高
  但比平原地区仍差很远
    解放几年来，在中央和毛主席的正确领导下，湖北省在山区工作方面是有成绩的。经过剿匪、反霸、土地改革和镇压反革命一系列的伟大的群众运动，长期压在山区人民头上的各种反动势力被彻底地打倒了，人民翻了身，生产发展了，生活也有了很大的改善。现在山区已经实现了农业合作化，农业合作社一般都办得不错，再经过一段时间的努力，我相信可以办得更好。在农业合作化的基础上，山区生产的发展和人民生活的改善，也就更加有了依靠。一九五六年是农业合作化的第一年，山区绝大多数的农业社都增了产，恩施专区八个县，一九五六年粮食生产比一九五五年增加了17％，绝大多数的社员的收入都有所增加。襄阳专区竹山县一九五二年粮食平均每人四百三十四斤，一九五六年平均每人五百五十八斤，增加百分之二十八。
    山区人民生活与解放前比较确实有了很大改善。解放以前，山区人民是过着牛马不如的生活，吃不饱，穿不暖，许多农民缺粮吃，每年总有几个月靠挖蕨根和野菜度日，“辣椒当盐，活渣（有的地方叫烂豆腐）过年。”这确是当时山区人民的实际生活情况。现在绝大多数人都有粮食吃了，吃蕨根和野菜的人已经很少了。过去山区多数农民都没有棉衣穿、没有被子盖，冬天一到，就只有坐到屋里烤火，山高天寒和缺少衣食，农民得气喘病（严重的支气管炎）的很多。有少数人甚至连一件单衣服都没有，十七、八岁的大姑娘没有裤子穿，并不是稀罕事。现在这种情况已经有了很大改变，家家都有了被子盖，没有棉衣穿的只是大山区的少数人了。布匹的销售量一九五二年是每人每年平均八尺，一九五六年已经上升到每人二十六尺，多数农民杀了年猪。对这些方面山区人民群众是满意的。我在来凤县和老农开座谈会，农民提起这些情形和解放前比较，就有几个老农谈到过去被蒋匪帮抓兵、抓伕、坐牢、杀头等等，以致他的儿子至今还未归家哭得说不出话来，甚至还有哭泣几次的，使我非常感动。
    几年来，山区人民生活虽然有了很大提高，但是和平原地区比较，那就还差的很远。现在山区人民的生活还是比较苦的，生活水平还是低下的，尤其是大山区还有很多困难一时不能解决。据了解恩施专区全区农民一九五六年每人平均收入只有四十元左右，有许多大高山每人每年平均收入还不到三十元，这比平原区一般还要低一倍以上。因此，必须用最大的努力来领导和帮助山区人民大力发展生产，逐步地改变这种穷困落后的状况。
    如何发展山区生产、改善山区人民生活呢？就我个人的观察和了解，我认为必须注意逐步解决如下几个问题：
        优先生产粮食
        发展多种经济
    改变山区面貌的根本办法是发展山区生产。不久以前人民日报曾经发表过“全面规划，建设山区”的社论，中共湖北省委也曾在去年十二月专门召开过山区工作会议，研究了发展山区生产的方针等问题，我认为这些都是非常重要和适时的。根据我个人的体会，当前发展山区生产中最突出的问题，就是粮食生产和多种经济的发展如何全面加以合理安排的问题。湖北山区各种经济作物如茶、麻、桐、漆、药材、果树、林业等的产量和增产潜力都是很大的。必须加强领导，大力发展。但是根据当前山区的经济特点，我认为发展多种经济又必须与粮食生产紧密结合，没有粮食生产的增长，多种经济的发展就没有可靠的基础和保证。目前山区粮食情况，部分地区是比较紧张的，个别地方出现忽视粮食生产的现象。随着人口的增长，人民消费量的提高，畜牧业的发展，可以肯定在一个相当长的时间内，山区的粮食还是一个十分重要的问题。因此，在山区必须坚决贯彻执行优先发展粮食生产的方针，在保证粮食够吃有余的前提下，全面规划，大力发展多种经济。据我所知，在粮食和多种经济的安排上，不少地方常发生顾此失彼的现象，以致影响生产。当然在贯彻执行这个方针时，还要防止不从客观情况出发，不照顾地区特点，主观主义办事的偏向发生。在封山育林，水土保持，处理轮荒地等具体政策上必须因地制宜，不能机械的生搬硬套。
    山区发展农业生产上的有利条件是很多的，但困难也不少，特别是劳动力不足的困难较为突出，其次各种自然灾害也较多，水、旱、虫、雹、兽各种灾害都有，特别是兽灾威胁很大，有时还伤及人命。农民流传着一首歌谣：“年年种庄稼，野兽光糟塌，好了有一半，不好不见面。”可见其为害之大。随之山区造林事业的发展，野兽对山区人民的生产和生活的威胁将日益增加。因此，必须注意依靠群众力量，总结群众的捕打预防经验，希望有关部门在火药、工具的研究供应上给予支援。
      逐步修通城镇公路
      尽早修建川汉铁路
    山区人民最大的困难就是交通不便运输困难。交通运输问题是发展山区生产、改善山区人民生活的关键性问题之一。事实证明，那里修了公路，那里的经济情况马上就起变化。恩施县见天坝乡是木材产区，过去不通公路木材不值钱，任其自生自灭。一九五五年公路修通了，木材值钱了，去年该乡有一个社仅木材一项就收入了三万多元，占全社总收入的百分之五十以上。群众收入增加了，造林积极性也大大提高。湖北山区有大量的木材、煤、铁、硫黄、桐油、生漆、茶叶、苎麻、畜产品、药材等各种物资资源，由于交通运输困难运不出来，对国家对人民都是很大损失。
    解决山区交通问题是个十分迫切而又艰巨的任务，一定要有计划地、逐步地、积极地加以解决，我个人认为首先必须有组织有领导的充分发挥山区各种民间运输工具的潜力，有计划地逐步修建各种人行道和骡马道，特别要强调畜力运输业的发展，群众已有经验，只要加以组织推广就可以搞开。
    其次要逐步修通各重要城镇间和主要物资集中地的公路，先修简易路面，通车后再逐步改善。要充分利用一切可以利用的河道，加以整修疏浚。这项任务十分艰巨，光靠地方力量困难很大，建议中央有关部门对山区交通问题给地方以必要的支持。另外根据勘察湖北恩施地区有大量的煤、铁矿藏（初步勘察建始铁蕴藏量在六亿吨以上）和森林资源（成材林蓄积量约一千二百万立方公尺），各种土特产数量也很大，建议中央能尽早兴修川汉铁路，而且通过恩施，进入四川。
    第三，几年来，山区的医疗卫生事业虽已有了很大的发展，但是和群众要求相比，还有很大距离。由于经济和文化落后，山区人民群众患传染病的很多，以梅毒、麻疯、血丝虫病、气喘病、眼疾等，对人民健康和农业生产威胁很大。从当前情况来看，当地医疗机构对这些病的治疗力量不足，办法不多，应该研究如何加强这方面的工作。
  调整粮食木材收购价格
    建立土家族区域自治
    从我到过的这些山区看，商业工作一般是做的很好的，特别是去年调高了桐、漆等收购价，降低了低档工业品和食盐价格，对发展山区生产，改善人民生活起了很大的作用。目前问题是粮食和木材的收购价格有点偏低，据了解抗战前一百斤稻谷可换白细布二十四尺，目前只能换十四尺九寸；杉木价每立方公尺六元到六元五角，松木每立方公尺四元，如劈成烧柴卖可卖十二元，因之林农反映比烧柴价还低。其次是省与省的价格安排问题，几年来还没有很好地解决。如五棓子，来凤县二十一元六角一担，湖南龙山只有一水之隔，就挂价二十六元五角一担，生漆，来凤县一百四十六元二角一担，龙山则是一百八十五元一担，群众意见很大。来凤县在七十五种商品中，有四十六种高于四川价格，有七种低于四川价格，只有二十二种基本相同。这些问题，需要我们省里和中央有关部门加以研究，早做处理。
    湖北省兄弟民族有十五万多人，在部分山区有相当数量的兄弟民族聚居区。如来凤、鹤峰等县的土家族，据初步了解就有十多万人。过去我们对这方面的工作做的不够，我自己分管这一工作，而对情况了解不够，工作抓的不紧，应负主要责任。我们应当加强这一地区兄弟民族的工作，首先应当注意培养干部，注意政治、经济、文化各方面给兄弟民族以照顾和帮助。经过一段工作后，把民族区域自治建立起来。现在湖北省已派出专人，进行调查研究，并在调查研究的基础上，制订民族区域自治方案，加强兄弟民族的工作。在这方面也希望中央多多给予我们以帮助和支持。
    以上是我所见到湖北山区工作中的几个主要问题，我想其中有部分情况和问题其他地区可能也存在，特简要提出供中央和各位代表参考并望批评指正。
