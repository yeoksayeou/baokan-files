    Imperialist Economic Pressure Bankrupted Egypt
    Si Wen
    On July 26th of last year, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company. This event shook the world, not only because of the importance of the Suez Canal itself, but also because it showed how turbulent the tide of national independence movements in the Middle East was, marking a further disintegration of the imperialist colonial system in Asia and Africa.
    Imperialists understood the great significance of the Suez Canal's nationalization for the national independence movements in Asia and Africa. Therefore, they used all means to strike and suppress Egypt. In addition to launching a military attack on Egypt at the end of October last year, imperialist countries have also carried out extensive and sustained economic offensives against Egypt over the past year.
    Boycott of the Suez Canal Failed
    Western countries first used the method of boycotting the canal to force Egypt to submit. Shortly after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Britain and France suddenly withdrew their pilots, attempting to paralyze canal shipping. But this trick did not succeed.
    The aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt interrupted the canal's navigation. After the failure of the British and French aggression, and after Egypt cleared the canal to restore navigation, the United States, Britain, and France repeated the old tune of "internationalizing the canal." But this clamor had already been sternly refuted. Britain, the United States, and France knew that "internationalization" was untenable, so they brought out the issues of "free navigation" and canal usage fees. They advocated that half of the canal usage fee income be placed in international banks and not handed over to Egypt until the canal issue was "thoroughly resolved." This proposal contained two conspiracies: (1) to essentially deny Egypt's sovereignty over the canal, because if the sovereignty of the canal belonged to Egypt, why should the usage fees not be controlled by Egypt? (2) The annual income from canal usage fees is approximately 30 million Egyptian pounds, of which approximately half is used to pay for various management and maintenance costs. Withholding half of the usage fees is equivalent to only allowing Egypt to manage the canal without allowing it to receive income from it. Moreover, Egypt urgently needs foreign exchange, and Western countries can use the withholding of half of the usage fees as bargaining chips in negotiations with Egypt.
    Egypt sternly refuted the absurd demands of Western countries. On March 19th and April 24th of this year, the Egyptian government successively issued two documents, reiterating its adherence to the Constantinople Convention, guaranteeing free navigation of the canal, and declaring that all usage fees must be paid to the Egyptian canal management agency in accordance with Egyptian regulations. Thereupon, the United States, Britain, and France announced that they would continue to boycott the canal.
    However, the fierce competition between capitalist countries destined the attempts of Britain, the United States, and France to fail.
    Asia, Australia, and the Middle East are a vast market and an important source of raw materials. After World War II, Britain, the United States, and France had an advantage in this market. However, in recent years, other Western European countries have actively expanded into this region, and they have all suffered from the oil shortage during the canal's interruption. Therefore, they are unwilling to follow Britain, the United States, and France. Ships from countries such as West Germany, Italy, Finland, Greece, and Japan paid all the usage fees to Egypt and passed through the canal after it reopened. The United States also played a double-dealing trick. On the one hand, it put forward a plan with Britain and France to only pay 50% of the usage fees to Egypt. On the other hand, its ships had already passed through the canal on Egyptian terms as early as April. The "Suez Canal Users Association" established by Britain, the United States, and France had, by this point, become a mere shell.
    In this situation, it was impossible for Britain and France to boycott the canal alone. Because:
    (1) The oil problem could not be solved. In the first half of 1956, Britain imported approximately 19.9 million tons of oil, and France imported 13 million tons, of which 67% and 53% respectively were imported through the canal. After the Suez Canal was cut off, Britain and France faced serious oil shortages. Purchasing from the United States was not only small in quantity and high in price, but also required a huge amount of foreign exchange. During the interruption, Britain had to pay $30 million per month for oil, and the oil was far from sufficient. As a result, Britain and France both suffered from oil shortages that affected industrial production and foreign exchange reserves.
    Before the reopening of the Suez Canal, the only consolation for Britain and France was that the entire Western Europe was similarly affected by the oil shortage. After the canal reopened, if Britain and France boycotted the canal alone, then only Britain and France would suffer from the oil shortage. In the context of increasingly acute competition for European economic leadership, this was clearly extremely unfavorable to Britain and France.
    (2) It seriously affected the trade of Britain and France with Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. In 1956, Britain's exports to the above-mentioned regions accounted for approximately 30% of Britain's total exports, and imports accounted for 29%; France's exports accounted for 9%, and imports accounted for 20%.
    For European trade with the above-mentioned regions, the Suez Canal is the shortest and cheapest route. During the interruption of the Suez Canal, the trade of Britain and France with this region was unfavorable compared with Japan, but compared with Europe, the situation was exactly the same. After the Suez Canal reopened, if Britain and France continued to boycott the canal, then Britain and France would be at a disadvantage in competition with the entire Europe, and the goods of Britain and France would be difficult to compete with due to high freight rates.
    More seriously, in the past two or three years, Britain has adopted the method of lowering domestic purchasing power to squeeze out some export sources, reduce imports, and attempt to improve the balance of payments. As a result, in 1956, approximately 700 million pounds of production capacity was not utilized. This year, with more factories putting into production, it is estimated that the remaining production capacity is even greater. France's balance of payments problem is extremely serious. Therefore, Britain and France are both urgently in need of expanding exports. The weakening of the trade position in Asia, Australia, and the Middle East is a major threat to Britain and France.
    (3) The problem of the way out for British and French merchant ships. The maritime income of Britain and France is an important part of their invisible income. After the reopening of the Suez Canal, the charter market in the capitalist world is not so tight. If British and French ships detour around the Cape of Good Hope, the freight rate will be far higher than taking the Suez Canal. In this way, what customers would be willing to charter their ships?
    In the face of ruthless reality, Britain and France had no choice but to submit. On May 13th of this year, Britain announced that it would resume using the canal. France continued to struggle for a month, but had to announce on June 13th that it would stop boycotting the canal. Britain and France, which had been rampant for more than a hundred years, had to bow their heads to Egypt, which they had always looked down upon.
    Economic Blockade Ineffective
    Simultaneous with the boycott of the Suez Canal, the United States, Britain, and France also conducted a wide range of economic blockades against Egypt.
    Due to the long-term oppression and exploitation by imperialism and the feudal dynasty, Egypt's industry is underdeveloped, and many necessities of life, industrial equipment, and raw materials depend on imports, while 80% of exports are concentrated in cotton. The annual foreign trade deficit is approximately 40 million Egyptian pounds (one Egyptian pound equals 2.872 US dollars), which is mainly made up by using existing foreign exchange reserves, and these foreign exchange reserves are mostly deposited in Britain and the United States. The imperialists saw this and, two days after Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Britain froze all of Egypt's sterling deposits of 114.9 million Egyptian pounds, and the United States followed suit by freezing approximately 50 million US dollars of Egyptian foreign exchange. At that time, Egypt's total foreign exchange reserves (excluding gold) were only 140 to 150 million Egyptian pounds. The Egyptian foreign exchange frozen by Britain and the United States accounted for more than 85% of Egypt's total foreign exchange. Britain and the United States attempted to paralyze Egypt's imports by freezing Egyptian foreign exchange, thereby causing chaos in the entire Egyptian economy.
    In addition, Egypt's wheat production decreased in 1955, and 500,000 tons needed to be imported in 1956. After the United States froze Egyptian foreign exchange, Egypt requested to purchase US wheat with Egyptian pounds. The United States has always been able to accept payment in the currency of the purchasing country when selling surplus agricultural products abroad. But this time it rejected Egypt's request, insisting on using US dollars for purchase. President Nasser pointed out that the United States' purpose was to threaten Egypt with starvation and force Egypt to submit. However, the imperialists were wrong, and their economic blockade failed. Many countries that supported the just struggle of the Egyptian people extended a friendly hand to Egypt and provided various assistance. Our country made an advance payment of 20 million Swiss francs to Egypt (and then donated 20 million francs free of charge after the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt); India provided a loan of 20 million Indian rupees; Saudi Arabia sold 15 million US dollars; Egypt also obtained an emergency loan of 15 million US dollars from the International Monetary Fund according to its own rights (and borrowed another 15 million US dollars after the outbreak of the war). In this way, Egypt had a considerable amount of foreign exchange to purchase necessary imported goods.
    In terms of material supply, the Soviet Union sold 400,000 tons of wheat to Egypt at a price lower than the international market price, solving Egypt's food problem for one year. The Soviet Union, Romania, and Saudi Arabia all supplied Egypt with a large amount of oil, guaranteeing Egypt's fuel supply. Our country supplies a wide variety of commodities such as frozen meat, cottonseed oil, chemical raw materials, tin, and steel. India also adjusted its payment method with Egypt, no longer using the payment method of 60% sterling and 40% Indian rupees, but changing it all to Indian rupees, making it easier for Egypt to obtain supplies of tea and jute products. The Egyptian government also adopted methods such as barter trade and triangular trade to import goods, while strictly controlling imports to ensure the normal supply of necessities.
    As a result, contrary to the expectations of the imperialists, although the Egyptian economy also encountered some difficulties, it was generally stable.
    In the struggle against imperialist economic pressure, the Egyptian people achieved a complete victory. The losers were the imperialists themselves, who lost Egypt, a vast market.
    After achieving a complete victory in the Suez Canal issue, Egypt has begun to negotiate various economic issues with Britain and France. Britain has agreed to unfreeze 6 million pounds of Egyptian deposits. As for the issue of unfreezing the remaining funds and compensating for the losses in Port Said, it seems that Britain cannot but make concessions. France has also recently been exploring the restoration of Egyptian-French trade and is willing to purchase Egyptian cotton in US dollars. It can be asserted that the economic blockade of Britain and France will soon completely disintegrate. Egypt's foreign trade is gradually returning to normal and developing in a healthy direction.
    In January 1957, Egypt announced the decree on the Egyptianization of foreign banks, insurance companies, and import agents. British and French banks, insurance companies, and import agents, which have always manipulated Egypt's finance and trade, can no longer stir up trouble. The Egyptian people can now use their own banks and insurance companies to serve the construction of their motherland.
    In terms of industrial construction, Egypt has recently formulated a five-year plan to build a series of light and heavy industries, including machine tool industry, timber industry, building materials industry, pharmaceutical industry, and other industries urgently needed domestically. The Aswan High Dam is also considering changing the plan so that it can be completed with less capital and shorter time, without relying on foreign funds.
    Having freed themselves from and overcome the imperialists, the Egyptian people are building an independent and prosperous Egypt. We believe that the Egyptian people, who have experienced arduous struggles, will surely victoriously realize their ideals.

    帝国主义对埃及的经济压力破产了
    思文
    去年7月26日，埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有。这件事轰动了全世界，这不单因为苏伊士运河本身的重要性，而且因为它显示出中东国家的民族独立运动的怒潮如何汹涌澎湃，标志着帝国主义在亚非地区的殖民体系进一步的瓦解。
    帝国主义者了解到苏伊士运河国有化对亚非民族独立运动的重大意义，因此它们运用了一切手段来打击和压制埃及。除了在去年10月底发动了对埃及的军事进攻外，一年来，帝国主义国家还对埃及进行了广泛的和持续的经济进攻。
    抵制苏伊士运河失败
    西方国家首先用抵制运河的办法来迫使埃及屈服。苏伊士运河公司国有化不久，英法就突然撤退了两国的引水员，企图借此瘫痪运河航运。但是这一招没有成功。
    英、法、以色列对埃及的侵略，中断了运河的通航。在英、法侵略失败，埃及清理运河使它恢复通航以后，美、英、法又重弹“运河国际化”的老调。可是这叫嚣早就受到了严正的驳斥。英、美、法自知“国际化”站不住脚，于是又捧出“自由航行”和运河使用费问题。它们主张把运河使用费收入的一半放在国际银行，在运河问题未“彻底解决”以前不交给埃及。这个主张包含两个阴谋：（1）在实质上否定埃及对运河的主权，因为如果运河主权属于埃及，使用费为什么可以不受埃及支配？（2）运河使用费每年收入约三千万埃镑，其中约有一半用来支付各种管理维持费用。把使用费的一半扣留起来，等于只让埃及管理而不让它从运河得到收入。而且，埃及急需外汇，西方国家扣留一半的使用费，在同埃及谈判中可以作为讨价还价的本钱。
    埃及严正地驳斥了西方国家的荒谬主张。今年3月19日和4月24日，埃及政府先后发表了两项文件，重申遵守君士坦丁堡公约，保证运河自由通航，并声明全部使用费必须按照埃及的规定，缴给埃及的运河管理机构。于是美、英、法宣布继续对运河进行抵制。
    可是资本主义国家之间的激烈竞争，命定了英、美、法的企图必然落空。
    亚洲、澳洲和中东是一个广大的市场，也是重要的原料供应地。二次大战后，英、美、法在这市场上占着优势。但是近年来，西欧其他国家积极向这个地区扩张，而且在运河断航期间，它们都吃尽了石油荒的苦头，因此他们都不愿跟着英美法跑。西德、意大利、芬兰、希腊、日本等国的船只，在运河复航后就把全部使用费交给埃及而通过了运河。美国也耍两面派手法，一方面和英法一道提出只交50％的使用费给埃及的方案，另一方面它的船只早在4月就按埃及的条件通过了运河。英、美、法一手搞起的“运河使用国协会”至此已名存实亡。
    在这种情况下，英、法不可能单独抵制运河。因为：
    （1）石油问题不能解决。1956年上半年，英国进口石油约一千九百九十万吨，法国进口一千三百万吨，其中经过运河输入的各占67％和53％。苏伊士运河断航后，英法都面临严重的石油荒。从美国购买，不但数量少，价格高，而且要付出巨量的外汇。在断航期间，英国每月要为石油付出三千万美元、石油还远不敷应用。结果，英法都因石油荒而影响工业生产和外汇储备。
    在苏伊士运河复航前，英、法唯一可以自慰的是整个西欧都同样受到石油荒的影响。在运河复航后，如果英法单独抵制运河，那么，遭到石油荒的就只有英、法。在争夺欧洲经济领导权日益尖锐的情况下，这对英、法显然是极为不利的。
    （2）严重影响英、法对亚洲、澳洲和中东的贸易。1956年，英国对上述地区的出口占英国出口总值30％左右，进口占29％；法国出口占9％，进口占20％。
    欧洲对上述地区贸易，经苏伊士运河是路程最短、费用最低的路线。在苏伊士运河断航期间，英、法对这地区的贸易，与日本比较是不利的，但和欧洲比较，则处境完全一样。苏伊士运河复航后，英、法如果继续抵制运河，那么英法在和整个欧洲的竞争上都处在不利的地位，英法的货物将因运费高昂而难以竞争。
    更严重的是，近两三年来，英国采取了降低国内购买力的办法来挤出一部分出口货源，减少进口，企图改善国际收支。结果，在1956年大约有七亿英镑的生产能力没有利用。本年因为有更多的工厂投入生产，估计剩余的生产能力更大。法国的国际收支问题极其严重。因此英、法都迫切需要扩大出口。在亚、澳和中东贸易地位的削弱，对英、法是一个大威胁。
    （3）英、法商船的出路问题。英法的海运收入是它们无形收入中重要的一项。苏伊士运河复航后，资本主义世界租船市场已不那么紧张。如果英法船只绕道好望角，运费就远高于取道苏伊士运河。这样，还有什么顾客愿意租用它们的船只？
    在无情的现实面前，英法除了屈服外，再也别无出路。本年5月13日，英国宣布恢复使用运河。法国继续挣扎了一个月，也不得不在6月13日宣布停止抵制运河。横行了百余年的英法，不得不对自己一向瞧不起的埃及低头了。
    经济封锁不起作用
    和抵制苏伊士运河同时，美、英、法三国还对埃及进行了广泛的经济封锁。
    埃及由于长期受到帝国主义和封建王朝的压迫剥削，工业不发达，许多生活必需品、工业设备和原料都仰赖进口，而出口则有80％集中在棉花一项商品。每年对外贸易大约有四千万埃镑（一埃镑合二点八七二美元）的逆差，主要靠动用现存的外汇储备来弥补，而这些外汇储备又大多存放在英国和美国。帝国主义者看准了这一点，在埃及宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化后两天，英国冻结了埃及全部英镑存款一亿一千四百九十万埃镑，美国接着也冻结了大约五千万美元的埃及外汇。当时埃及全部外汇储备（不包括黄金）也不过一亿四、五千万埃镑。英美冻结的埃及外汇，占埃及全部外汇的85％以上。英、美企图用冻结埃及外汇的办法来使埃及的进口陷于瘫痪，从而引起埃及整个经济的混乱。
    另外，1955年埃及小麦减产，1956年需要进口五十万吨。在美国冻结埃及外汇后，埃及曾经要求用埃镑购买美国小麦。美国对外倾销剩余农产品，一向可以用购买国的货币付款的。但这次它却拒绝埃及的要求，坚持非用美元购买不可。纳赛尔总统指出，美国的目的，是企图用饥饿来威胁埃及，使埃及屈服。但是，帝国主义者想错了，它们的经济封锁失败了。许多支持埃及人民的正义斗争的国家，都向埃及伸出了友谊之手，提供了各种援助。我国向埃及预付了货款二千万瑞士法郎（英、法、以侵埃后又无偿赠予二千万法郎）；印度提供了二千万印度卢比的贷款；沙特阿拉伯售予一千五百万美元；埃及也根据自己的权利，向国际货币基金取得了一千五百万美元紧急贷款（战事发生以后，又借到一千五百万美元）。这样，埃及就有了相当数量的外汇来购买必需的进口商品。
    在物资供应方面，苏联以低于国际市场价格卖给埃及四十万吨小麦，解决了埃及一年内的粮食问题。苏联、罗马尼亚和沙特阿拉伯都供应埃及大量石油，保证了埃及的燃料供应。我国供应冻肉、棉籽油、化工原料、锡、钢等种类繁多的商品。印度也调整了和埃及的支付办法，不再用60％英镑、40％印度卢比的支付办法，全部改用印度卢比，使埃及容易得到茶叶、黄麻制品的供应。埃及政府也采用易货、三角贸易等方式进口，同时严格管制进口，保证必需品的正常供应。
    结果，和帝国主义的预期相反，埃及经济虽然也遇到一些困难，但一般来说仍然是稳定的。
    在反帝国主义经济压力的斗争中，埃及人民彻底胜利了。受到损失的是帝国主义者自己，它们失去了埃及这个广大的市场。
    在苏伊士运河问题获得全胜后，埃及已经开始和英、法谈判各项经济问题。英国已同意解冻六百万英镑的埃及存款，至于解冻其余款项以及赔偿塞得港损失的问题，看来英国也不能不让步；法国最近也在试探恢复埃、法贸易，并且愿意用美元购买埃棉。可以断言，英、法的经济封锁，很快就要完全瓦解。埃及的对外贸易，正在逐渐恢复正常并向健康的道路发展。
    埃及在1957年1月宣布了外国银行、保险公司和进口代理商埃及化的法令，一向操纵埃及金融、贸易的英、法银行、保险公司和进口代理商再也不能兴风作浪。埃及人民从此可以利用自己的银行、保险公司为祖国建设服务。
    在工业建设方面，埃及在最近已拟订好五年计划，要兴建一系列的轻、重工业，其中包括工作母机工业、木材工业、建筑材料工业、制药业等国内急需的各项工业。阿斯旺高水坝也在考虑改变计划，可以用较少资金和较短时间建成，不必依赖国外的资金。
    摆脱并战胜了帝国主义的埃及人民，正在建设一个独立富强的埃及。我们相信，经历了艰苦斗争的埃及人民，一定能胜利地实现他们的理想。
