Visiting the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant
By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

It was early summer in June when I took the train on the Binzhou (Harbin-Manzhouli) Railway from Harbin, passing through the northern Manchurian grasslands, to visit the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant on the banks of the Nen River.

Fularji was originally an ordinary pasture for the Daur ethnic group in the northern part of Heilongjiang Province, but in recent years, it has become known throughout the country. This is not because any famous scenic spots or historical sites have been newly discovered here, but because the scale and importance of the heavy machinery plant built here have been widely spread and known by the people. This plant was designed with the technical essence of more than 30 years of heavy machinery industrial construction in the Soviet Union, needless to say how superb and advanced its technology is; in terms of scale, it can also be compared with many large heavy machinery plants in the world. After the completion of this plant, it will manufacture the latest large-scale primary rolling mills, rail and bridge rolling mills, seamless steel pipe rolling mills, steel plate rolling mills, 500-ton capacity open-hearth furnaces, and 1,500-cubic-meter capacity open-hearth furnaces that China could not manufacture in the past. Some equipment is even more advanced than the newly built equipment in Anshan Iron and Steel in recent years. Equipment for producing medium and heavy steel plates and large seamless steel pipes can be manufactured here. This plant will also supply various large forged shafts and other large castings and forgings needed by China's motor factories, turbine factories, and large machinery factories.

The internal equipment of this plant will be highly mechanized and automated. Because the layout is advanced, it requires very strict quality of construction, otherwise it will affect the normal operation of these equipment.

The employees of the Construction Engineering Department directly affiliated Engineering Company and several other installation enterprises, who had built the Changchun First Automobile Factory, undertook the task of building this complex and arduous project. Starting in 1955, they came to the construction site one after another, spent two rare cold winters on the northern Manchurian grasslands, braved the sandstorms of tens of thousands of feet blown by the Mongolian wind in the spring, and built some residential and office buildings. Now, rows of residential buildings have been built; two milky-yellow office buildings have been completed, and four factory buildings such as metal structure, auxiliary, and model, which started construction last year, and more than a dozen large buildings such as warehouses and substations have also been erected.

This year is the peak year of the construction engineering construction of the heavy machinery plant. All of the main factory buildings of the plant have been started. On the construction ground of more than 100 hectares on the bank of the Nen River, piling machines with towering iron towers are making loud noises, and the roar of thousands of machines forms a magnificent construction symphony, breaking the loneliness of the Great Northern Wilderness grassland. Hundreds of thousands of builders are working towards one goal.

The soil in the Fularji area was originally relatively hard, but the hard soil here seems unusually soft when building this giant factory. Therefore, it is necessary to drive reinforced concrete pile groups under the foundation projects of the main factory buildings and equipment to increase the bearing capacity of the soil. This is one of the most difficult projects of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant. In principle, foundation piling is not unfamiliar to construction companies. However, each pile here is 12 to 16 meters high, one foot two inches square, and weighs more than 10,000 kilograms. To drive these piles more than one zhang deep from the ground, a total of more than 11,000 piles must be driven. This is something that many construction workers have not experienced. The employees of the Shanghai Foundation Engineering Company, who had personally built China's tallest building—the Shanghai International Hotel—and the famous Qiantang River Bridge and other complex foundation projects, deeply felt the arduousness of the project. Now, Chinese and Soviet foundation experts and all the employees of the Construction Engineering Department directly affiliated Engineering Company and Shanghai Foundation Company are taking all effective measures to solve these problems.

Underground in the heat treatment workshop, an artificial lake with a depth of 26 meters and an area of about 800 square meters is to be excavated. In this lake, a reinforced concrete "caisson" equivalent to an eight-story building and weighing three million kilograms will be sunk underground. In the future, heat-processed parts weighing several tons to dozens of tons will have to be quenched here; then transported out for cold processing. Now, this project has already started. Four huge excavators stretched their giant arms, quickly and accurately swallowed the full bucket of soil, and turned to dump the soil into the truck boxes of dump trucks. Dump trucks, one after another, were filled with soil and sped away like shooting stars. The engineer in charge of the construction of this project told me: After digging to a depth of eight meters to the water layer (water outlet), we erected formwork on the "lake" and manufactured reinforced concrete "caissons" according to the design standards. At that time, 20 air compressors were used to compress the atmospheric pressure, evacuate the water in the caisson, and the workers went down from the specially made wellbore to dig the soil under great air pressure. The caisson sank as it was dug, relying on its own weight, until it sank to the design elevation. Now, the construction unit is selecting a group of strong young people for construction technical training, training them to live in pressurized, airtight rooms, so that they gradually adapt and get used to this living condition in order to carry out smooth construction underground.

Most of the 16 main production factory buildings and workshops in the plant are steel structures. Among them, the largest steel casting and hydraulic press joint operation workshop is a large building as high as a 14-story building. In this building, there are 82-ton steel columns, 47-ton crane beams, and 175-ton and dozens of tons of cranes, which will run on two layers, upper and lower. Their load exceeds that of railway bridges. How to stably place such heavy columns and crane beams on the steel frame is indeed a complicated matter! In order to solve the construction problems of this project, the country has already ordered a 70-meter-high tower crane from the German Democratic Republic, which will be shipped soon. Even with such a crane, it still needs to be assembled three times, and many unexpected difficulties will be encountered during installation. This requires the builders to overcome difficulties and create miracles. (Attached picture)

    访富拉尔基重型机器厂
    本报记者　康伟中
    正是初夏6月天，我乘坐滨（哈尔滨）洲（满洲里）铁路的火车，从哈尔滨出发，穿过北满草原，去访问了嫩江河畔的富拉尔基重型机器厂。
    富拉尔基原是黑龙江省北部地区达呼尔族一个普通的牧场，近几年，它却闻名全国了。这倒不是这个地方新发现了什么名胜和古迹，而是因为这里兴建的重型机器厂的规模和它的重要性已为广大人民所传诵和熟知了。这个厂，是苏联集中三十多年建设重型机器工业的技术精华设计出来的，不消说它的技术是多么高超和先进；就其规模而言，也可以和世界上许多大的重型机器厂相媲美。这个厂建成以后，将制造我国过去不能制造的最新式的大型初轧机、钢轨桥梁轧机、无缝钢管轧机、钢板轧机、五百吨容量的大平炉和一千五百立方公尺容量的大平炉，有些设备比鞍钢近几年来新建的设备还要先进，生产中厚钢板、粗大的无缝钢管等设备都可以由这里制造出来。这个厂还将供给我国电机厂、汽轮机厂、大型机器厂需要的各种大型锻轴和其他大型铸锻件。
    这个厂内部的设备将是高度机械化和自动化的。由于设置是先进的，它要求建筑施工的质量也是非常严格的，否则就会影响这些设备的正常运转。
    曾经建设过长春第一汽车厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司和其他几个安装企业的职工们，担任了修建这项复杂而艰巨的工程任务。从1955年开始，他们陆续来到了工地，渡过了北满草原上两个少有的寒冬，冒着春季蒙古风刮起的万丈风沙，修建了一些住宅和办公大楼，现在，一幢幢的住宅楼房建成了；两座乳黄色的办公大楼已经完工，去年动工建设的金属结构、辅助、模型等四个厂房和仓库、变电所等十几个大建筑物也都矗立起来了。
    今年是重型机器厂建筑工程施工高潮的一年，全厂十几个主要厂房工程全部开工了。嫩江河畔一百余公顷的建筑地面上，铁塔林立的打桩机，发出咚咚的巨响，上千台机器的轰鸣声组成雄壮的建设交响乐，划破了北大荒草原的寂寞。成千上万的建设者向着一个目标工作着。
    富拉尔基地区的土质本来是比较坚硬的，但是，修建这座巨型工厂，这里的坚硬土质却显得异常松软了。因此就必须在主要厂房和设备的基础工程的下面，打入钢筋混凝土桩群，以增加土壤的承载力。这是富拉尔基重型机器厂最难做的工程之一。按理说，基础打桩，对建筑企业来说并不是陌生的事。但是，这里每根桩子就有十二公尺至十六公尺高、一尺二寸见方、一万多斤重，要把这些桩子打进离地面一丈多深的地方，一共要打一万一千多根。这是许多建筑工人没有经历过的事情。曾经亲手建设过中国最高楼房——上海国际饭店和出名的钱塘江大桥等复杂基础工程的上海基础工程公司的职工们，深深地感到工程的艰巨。现在，中苏两国基础专家和建筑工程部直属工程公司和上海基础公司的全体职工们，正在采取一切有效措施解决这些问题。
    在热处理车间的地下，要开挖深二十六公尺，占地约八百平方公尺的人造湖。就在这个湖里，要把一个相当于八层楼房高、重三百万公斤的钢筋混凝土“沉箱”沉入地下。将来几吨到几十吨重的热加工部件，都得经过这里淬火；然后运转出去，进行冷加工。现在，这个工程已经开始施工了，四台巨大的挖土机，伸长了巨臂，迅速而准确地吞下满斗槽的泥土，转身把土倾倒在自卸汽车的车箱里。自卸汽车一辆一辆载满了土，像流星似的飞驰而去。负责这项工程施工的工程师告诉我：在挖到八公尺深到了水层（出水）后，我们就在“湖”上架起了模型板，按照设计标准，制造钢筋混凝土“沉箱”。那时，用二十台空气压缩机压进大气压，排除沉箱内的水，工人们从特制井筒下去，在很大的气压下挖土。沉箱就借着自重的力量，边挖边沉，直沉到设计标高。现在，建筑单位正在挑选一部分身体强壮的青年，进行施工技术的训练，训练他们在加大气压、密不透气的房间里生活，使之逐步适应和习惯这种生活条件，以便在地下顺利施工。
    全厂十六个主要生产厂房和车间，绝大部分是钢结构的。其中最大的铸钢和水压机联合作业车间，是十四层楼房高的大建筑物。在这个建筑物里，有八十二吨的钢柱、四十七吨的行车梁，还有一百七十五吨和几十吨的吊车，将分上下两层运行，它们的负荷量超过了铁路桥梁。对这样重的柱子和行车梁，如何平稳地安放在钢架上，这的确是一件复杂的事啊！国家为了解决这个工程的施工问题，早已和德意志民主共和国订购了一台七十公尺高的塔式起重机，不久就可运到。即使用了这样的起重机，也还得分三次装配，而且在安装中也会遇到许多意想不到的困难，这就需要建设者们克服困难，创造奇迹。（附图片）
