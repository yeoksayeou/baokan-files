The International Geophysical Year's observation work officially began on July 1st. Scientists from various countries participating in the Geophysical Year's measurement work have gathered at their designated observation stations on time to conduct comprehensive observations and research on many issues in geophysics, and to exchange all scientific data obtained.

The Earth itself and the atmosphere surrounding it are a whole in the universe. To understand its physical phenomena, it is necessary to have a comprehensive observation of it, and then analyze the observed data, and then draw a more comprehensive summary.

The holding of the International Geophysical Year has its objective reasons and historical background. At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, humans gradually realized through accidental experience and discoveries that there were many special natural phenomena near the Earth's poles that needed to be understood. Driven by curiosity, many expeditions went to the Arctic region at that time. Their main purpose of exploration at that time was for material gains, such as fur, oil, and fish; at the same time, people also took pride in discovering new islands and naming them. They regarded the observation of natural phenomena and scientific research as secondary purposes. At that time, there was no contact or cooperation between the expeditions of various countries, so although a lot of manpower and material resources were spent, the scientific gains were not commensurate. In order to enable the expedition teams to obtain scientific results, Austrian Lieutenant Captain Weyprecht suggested at the forty-eighth meeting of German Natural Scientists and Physiologists in 1875 that an international expedition team should be organized, and proposed that the expedition team should take the observation of natural phenomena and scientific research as its primary purpose. Weyprecht's opinion was gradually accepted by the scientists at that time. Later, Weyprecht drafted a plan and presented it at the Meteorological Society meeting held in Rome in 1879. On October 1 of the same year, the first International Polar Year Conference was held in Hamburg, Germany (because the area to be observed at the meeting was limited to the Arctic, it was called the International Polar Year Conference). The meeting decided that the International Polar Year would be from autumn 1881 to autumn 1882. In order to enable more countries to participate in the observation work of the International Polar Year, and to allow everyone to have sufficient preparation time before the observation, the Second International Polar Year Conference held in August 1880 decided to postpone the date of the International Polar Year to August 1, 1882, to September 1, 1883. It was also stipulated that continuous measurements should be taken all day on the 1st and 15th of each month. The research projects included: some simple problems in meteorology, such as air temperature, humidity, wind, cloud, rain, and snow; geomagnetic measurement; the shape, color, and height of the aurora, etc.

In the decades after the first International Polar Year, all sciences have developed significantly, especially in the first two or thirty years of the twentieth century, the theory of relativity, quantum theory, atomic physics, radio physics, and other important disciplines have emerged successively. Therefore, scientists felt it necessary to repeat some of the measurement work in the first International Polar Year. On the one hand, they wanted to know whether the observed phenomena had changed with the passage of time; on the other hand, they would obtain more precise data with improved instruments and methods; and they could also commemorate the first International Polar Year. In 1929, at the suggestion of the German Dominik, the International Meteorological Society organized the Second International Polar Year. In the same year, this suggestion was sponsored by the International Association of Geodesy and Geophysics, and it was resolved that the Second International Polar Year would be held from 1932 to 1933. In this polar year, in addition to repeating some of the observation work of the first polar year, several new observation projects were added. The number of participating countries has also increased slightly. At the same time, airplanes and balloons were used to measure the upper atmosphere, and the observation range was no longer limited to the ground. However, the observation area was still limited to the polar regions, and no comprehensive observation was made of the entire Earth. Therefore, the results obtained were only partial scientific data.

In the spring of 1950, scientists from various countries suggested that the Third International Polar Year be held from 1957 to 1958 for two reasons: (1) The study of the activity of sunspots has an important relationship with geophysical phenomena. From 1957 to 1958 was the year when sunspots were most active, and the cycle of sunspot activity is about eleven years. If this International Polar Year is not held in 1957, it will inevitably be postponed to eleven years later. (2) In recent years, especially after the Second World War, the progress in science and engineering technology has been unusually rapid. The development of scientific research in radio physics and rockets has provided people with good tools for high-altitude measurement. Using these new achievements to observe the Earth will yield greater results. This suggestion was supported by scientists from various countries. Therefore, in 1951, the International Association of Geodesy and Geophysics formally suggested that the International Council of Scientific Unions approve and launch it. The international scientific organizations participating in this Geophysical Year also include the International Astronomical Union, the Association of Theoretical and Applied Physics, the Geographical Society, the Biological Society, the Radio Science Association, and the International Radio Consultative Committee.

In May 1952, a special committee was established under the International Council of Scientific Unions to comprehensively plan and organize this work, in order to achieve international unity and cooperation. At the same time, it was stipulated that the areas for observation and measurement would not be limited to the Earth's Arctic, and some other important areas near the Antarctic equator along 70 degrees west longitude, 10 degrees east longitude, and 140 degrees east longitude were also included in the observation range. In October of the same year, it was also decided to change the name of the International Polar Year to the International Geophysical Year, and finally the time was determined to be from July 1, 1957, to the end of December 1958, a total of eighteen months. It was also stipulated that there would be an average of five "World Days" per month, three of which were pre-designated "Regular World Days." Two of the three regular world days were around the first day of each lunar month; the other was around the seventh day of each month. The remaining two "World Days" were called "Special World Days" and were temporarily determined by designated agencies based on the activity of sunspots, whether it would lead to magnetic storms, auroras, and other special physical phenomena. These phenomena cannot be predicted in advance, and can only be known a dozen hours before they occur and then notified to the measurement agencies or observation stations by radio. In addition, for the convenience of meteorological observation, it was also stipulated that for ten days every three months, continuous and concentrated measurements should be made on problems in meteorology. The study of changes in seasons such as the vernal equinox, autumnal equinox, winter solstice, and summer solstice are all included in these ten-day periods. Four principles were laid down for the arrangement of work and observation stations: (1) Priority should be given to problems that need to be observed simultaneously in various places; (2) Attention should be paid to geophysical problems that can only be solved with a large amount of data; (3) Attention should be paid to areas that have not been measured before; (4) Attention should be paid to slowly changing physical phenomena, so that they can be compared with future measurements.

The task of the International Geophysical Year is to understand the objective laws and various natural phenomena in geophysics through friendly cooperation, so that human beings can live more happily and beautifully on the Earth. In this Geophysical Year, radio technology will be widely used, whether it is transmitting signals or data, or remote control and measurement, as well as many of the instruments used. At the same time, in addition to using airplanes and balloons to make measurements at altitudes of tens of kilometers, rockets with complex instruments will also be used to make measurements at altitudes of hundreds of kilometers.

What is most interesting and of great significance is the trial production and utilization of artificial satellites. Artificial satellites can not only be launched to altitudes of 500 kilometers above the ground, but also continue to orbit the Earth at high altitudes for several days or even dozens of days according to a predetermined orbit. It will become a laboratory for scientists in the high altitude. It carries various applied scientific instruments and makes long-term observations in the high altitude, and transmits the results and data to ground observation stations by radio. In addition to making many observations of geophysical phenomena, artificial satellites can also help us verify the theories in general relativity with experimental data.

The projects to be observed and studied in this International Geophysical Year are very extensive, including roughly the following:

Observation of sunspot activity. The number of sunspots is constantly changing. Sometimes there are protruding parts or ejected flames on the sun, which also emit a large number of high-energy particles. Because hydrogen ions collide violently with each other at high temperatures, a large number of interfering electromagnetic waves are also generated, emitted from different depths of the sun. These all have a significant impact on physical phenomena on Earth. Observatories and observation stations will monitor the sun at all times. Because some of the light emitted from the sun is absorbed by the air on the ground and cannot reach the ground, it is necessary to use a spectrometer to take pictures of the sun's spectrum at high altitudes. Observe the interfering electromagnetic waves emitted from the sun by radio, so as to know the situation of the disturbances on the sun, and transmit the observation results to the relevant agencies or stations in a short time.

Observation of aurora and airglow. The aurora is the light in the sky near the Earth's north and south polar regions, and is often seen in high-latitude regions. Its color, shape, and brightness are constantly changing. For example, the aurora in February 1872 was colorful, exceptionally bright, and could be seen as far away as India. This year, many places in the Soviet Union have seen pale green arched auroras, with crimson spots on both sides. Airglow is the faint light in the sky on moonless nights. It is also constantly changing. Winter nights are different from summer nights; tonight is different from last night. Both auroras and airglow are related to sunspots. During observation, we will use a spectrometer to record their spectra; and we will pay special attention to observing the spectral lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and other molecules or atoms. In addition, the Størmer method will be used to measure the position and height of the aurora.

Observation of geomagnetism. The magnetic field on the ground can be assumed to be generated by the Earth itself as a magnet. Some people believe that there are vortex-like currents inside the Earth, which makes the Earth exhibit magnetic phenomena. Although the intensity of the magnetic field on the ground usually changes slightly, it is not drastic. However, when there are disturbances in sunspots, the magnetic field changes sharply, which is called a magnetic storm. The physical process of magnetic storms is not yet fully understood, and more data are needed to verify the existing theories. Therefore, we need to continuously measure the daily changes in geomagnetism this year, when sunspot activity is at its peak, and pay attention to its relationship with sunspots.

Observation of cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that fly from outside the sky to the ground. Some particles have energies far exceeding the energy that the world's largest accelerator can obtain. Their penetration is extremely strong and can penetrate several meters of steel plates. Although we have a preliminary understanding of the properties of cosmic rays, their origin is still an unsolved mystery. Some people believe that they come from nebulae in remote places, and are therefore isotropic in the universe; but others believe that they belong to the Milky Way. Therefore, we need more experimental data to verify different theories. We need to measure in different places and at different altitudes in order to deduce the effects of geomagnetism and the ionosphere.

Observation of earthquakes. Earthquakes often bring losses of life and property to mankind. The cause of earthquakes may be volcanic eruptions, faulting or collapse of the strata, which causes large-amplitude vibrations of the Earth's crust, which propagate in the form of waves in all directions. If an alarm can be issued before an earthquake, it will reduce its harm. But how to correctly predict the occurrence of earthquakes is also the object of research in the Geophysical Year.

Observation of the ocean. In ocean physics, we will seek the causes of deep-water circulation in the ocean, the relationship between long-period and short-period sea level rise and fall and wind and atmospheric pressure, and analyze the spectrum of ocean waves, so as to study its physical process of generation and the influence of wind. How to use meteorological data to predict the size and condition of sea waves is not only related to the safety of coastal residents, but also very important for national defense. The temperature of the sea surface can be accurately measured with a heat-sensitive semiconductor carried on an airplane, which will help to understand the problem of heat exchange.

Observation of cosmic dust and meteorites. There is a lot of cosmic dust in space, which is a clue to the study of the origin of the universe; like meteorites, they all have an impact on the flight of artificial satellites. We can use microphones carried on artificial satellites to measure how much and how big they are.

The above is only a part of the research projects of the Geophysical Year. There are many other scientific projects to be studied, such as glaciers, ionosphere, latitude and longitude, meteorology, topography, and gravity.

In short, there are many projects to be studied in this International Geophysical Year, and the scale of research is also very large. This work will leave an important page in the history of science. Scientists all over the world are now confidently looking forward to a scientific harvest.

Our country officially participated in the observation work of the International Geophysical Year in 1955. In addition to the establishment of the People's Republic of China National Committee for the International Geophysical Year to lead this work, it also sent representatives to attend conferences related to the Geophysical Year held in Belgium, the Soviet Union, and Spain. In our country, many meteorological stations and observation stations have been established according to longitude and latitude distribution, and preparations are being made to measure the seven scientific projects that our country participates in (namely geomagnetism, earthquakes, sunspot activity, cosmic rays, ionosphere, latitude and longitude measurement, and meteorology).

But it is regrettable that the Executive Bureau of the Special Committee for the International Geophysical Year has unreasonably recognized the so-called "Taipei Academia Sinica" as the China International Geophysical Year Committee (Taipei). This matter has aroused the indignation of the vast number of scientists. Zhu Kezhen, chairman of the National Committee for the International Geophysical Year of our country, has sent a telegram to Chapman, chairman of the Special Committee for the International Geophysical Year, to lodge a serious protest.

    国际地球物理年的历史和它的任务
    杜连耀
    国际地球物理年的观测工作，已于7月1日正式开始。参加地球物理年各项测量工作的各国科学工作者，均已按时集中到预定的观测台站，对地球物理中的许多问题进行全面观测和研究，并交换一切获得的科学资料。
    地球本身和包围着它的大气，是宇宙间的一个整体。要了解它的物理现象，必须对它有全面观测，并将观测得到的资料再进行分析，然后才能得出较为全面的总结。
    国际地球物理年的举行，是有它的客观原因和历史背景的。十八世纪末和十九世纪初，人类根据偶然的经验和发现，逐渐体会到靠近地球两极的地区，有许多特殊的自然现象需要了解。受着好奇心的驱使，当时曾有许多探险队到北极地区探险。那时他们探险的主要目的，是为了物质上的收获，如皮毛油鱼等；同时人们也以发现新的岛屿并以给岛屿命名为荣。他们把对自然现象的观测和科学研究，作为次要目的。那时各国探险队之间既无联系又无合作，所以虽然花费了很大的人力物力，但在科学上并没有得到应有的收获。为了使探险队能得到科学上的成果，奥国的中尉队长威普瑞士，于1875年在德国的自然科学与生理学第四十八次会议中，建议组织国际探险队，并提出探险队应以观测自然现象和科学研究为首要目的。威普瑞士的意见逐渐为当时的科学家所接受。后来威普瑞士又拟定了一个计划，于1879年在罗马召开的气象学会上提出。同年10月1日，在德国的汉堡举行了第一次国际极年会议（因会上提出要观测的地区，只限于北极，故称为国际极年会议）。会上决定从1881年秋到1882年秋为国际极年。为了使更多的国家能参加国际极年的观测工作，并使大家能在观测前有充分的准备时间，在1880年8月召开的第二次国际极年会议上，又决定把国际极年的日期推迟至1882年8月1日到1883年9月1日举行。并规定每月1日和15日全日连续测量。研究的项目有：气象学中的一些简单问题，如空气的温度、湿度和风云雨雪等；地磁的测量；极光的形状颜色和高度等。
    第一个国际极年后的几十年中，各门科学都有了显著的发展，尤其是二十世纪最初的二三十年内，相对论、量子论、原子物理、无线电物理等重要学科相继出现。因此，科学工作者觉得有必要重复第一个国际极年内的一些测量工作。一方面想知道已观测过的现象有否随时间的消逝而有所改变；另外用改良了的仪器和方法，将会得到比较精密的数据；又可以借此纪念第一个国际极年。1929年，在德国人杜米尼克的建议下，国际气象学会又组织了第二次国际极年。同年这个建议得到国际大地测量和地理学会的赞助，并议决第二次国际极年在1932到1933年举行。在这次极年中，除了重复第一次极年时的一些观测工作外，还增添了几项新的观测项目。参加的国家也略有增加。同时更采用了飞机和气球等进行对高空大气的测量，观测范围已经不限于地面。唯观测地区，仍限于两极地带，对整个地球未作全面的观测。因此，取得结果只是局部的科学资料。
    1950年春，各国科学家们又建议于1957到1958年举行第三次国际极年，理由有二：（一）研究太阳上黑斑的活动对地球物理现象有重要的关系，从1957年到1958年是太阳上黑斑最活动的一年，而太阳上黑斑活动的周期是十一年左右，如果这次国际极年不在1957年举行，势必推迟到十一年以后。（二）近年来，特别是二次大战后，科学和工程技术上的进步异常迅速，无线电物理和火箭方面科学研究工作的发展，使得人们对高空测量有了很好的工具。利用这方面的新成就对地球进行观测，将会取得更大的成果。这个建议得到了各国科学工作者的支持。遂于1951年由国际大地测量和地球物理学协会正式建议经国际科学协会理事会赞同而发起。参加这次地球物理年的国际科学组织还有国际天文学协会，理论与应用物理学协会，地理学协会，生物学协会，无线电学协会和无线电咨询委员会等。
    1952年5月，在国际科学协会下建立了一个特别委员会，负责全面规划并组织这项工作，以求得国际间的统一和合作。同时，规定出进行观察和测量的地区，将不限于地球的北极，把南极赤道附近沿西经七十度、东经十度和一百四十度的一些其他重要地区，也列入观测范围以内。同年10月又决定把国际极年的名称改为国际地球物理年，最后把时间确定为从1957年7月1日到1958年12月底，共十八个月。又规定每月平均有五个“世界日”，其中三个是预先指定的“正规世界日”。在三个正规世界日中又有两个在阴历每月的初一前后；另一个则在每月初七左右，剩下的两个“世界日”，称为“特殊世界日”，是临时由指定的机关看太阳上黑斑活动的情况，是否有导致磁暴、极光和其他特殊物理现象而定。这些现象还不能预先推断，只能在发生前十几个小时察知后再用无线电告诉各测量机关或观测站。此外，为了气象学上观测的方便，还规定了每三个月中有十天对气象学中的问题作连续和集中的测量，春分、秋分、冬至、夏至等节令变化的研究，都包括在这些以十天为期的日子里。对工作和观测台站的安排作了四个原则性的规定：（一）需要在各地同时观测的问题，尽先观测；（二）注意需要大量资料方能解决的地球物理问题；（三）注意以前没有测量过的地区；（四）注意变化缓慢的物理现象，以便与以后的测量相比较。
    国际地球物理年的任务是要通过友好合作的方法，来了解地球物理中的客观规律和各种自然现象，使人类在地球上生活更幸福、美好。在这次地球物理年中，不论是传递信号或数据，或远程控制及测量以及许多使用的仪器，都将广泛地采用无线电技术。同时，除了用飞机和气球到几十公里的高空作测量外，还要采用带有复杂仪器的火箭，射到数百公里的高空进行测量。
    令人最感兴趣并具有重大意义的是人造卫星的试制和利用。人造卫星不仅能投射到距地面五百公里的高空，还能按预定的轨道继续在高空中绕地球飞行数日以至数十日。它将成为科学工作者在高空中的实验室。它携带着各种应用的科学仪器，在高空中作长时间的观测，将观测的结果和数据用无线电传送到地面上的观测站。人造卫星除了能作许多地球物理现象的观测外，还能帮助我们以实验的数据验证普通相对论中的理论。
    本届国际地球物理年所要观测和研究的项目，非常广泛，其中大致包括以下各项：
    对太阳黑斑活动的观测。太阳上黑斑的数目是时常改变的，有时太阳上还有突出的部分或喷起的火焰，同时发出大量的高能量的粒子。因为氢离子在高温下猛烈相互碰撞，也产生了大量的干扰电磁波，从太阳上不同的深度处发出。这些都对地球上的物理现象有重大影响。天文台和观测站将时刻监视着太阳。因为从太阳发出来的光线有一部分被地面上的空气吸收，不能到达地面，所以必须用光谱仪到高空去拍摄太阳的光谱。用无线电的方法观测从太阳上发出的干扰电磁波，借以知道太阳上扰动的情况，并将观测的结果在短时间内传达给有关的机关或台站。
    对极光和气辉的观测。极光是靠近地球南北极地区上空中的光亮，在纬度高的地区时常见到。它的颜色形状和亮度，时常变换不定，例如1872年2月的极光，彩色艳丽，光亮异常，远在印度还可以看见。今年在苏联的许多地方都看到了淡绿色拱门式的极光，两边还配有绛红色的斑点。气辉是在没有月亮的夜间，天空中所呈现的微弱的光亮。它也是时常改变的。冬夜的和夏夜的不一样；今夜的和昨夜的也不一样。极光和气辉都和太阳上的黑斑有关，观测时我们将要用光谱仪记录它们的光谱；并将特别注意观测氧、氮和其他分子或元子的谱线。此外，还要用斯托莫方法测量极光的位置和高度。
    对地磁的观测。地面上的磁场，可假想为地球本身是一个磁石而产生的。有人认为地球内部有旋涡式的电流，遂使地球呈现磁的现象。在地面上磁场的强度平时虽稍有改变，但不剧烈。可是当太阳上的黑斑有扰动时，磁场就急剧地改变，称为磁暴。磁暴发生的物理过程还不十分清楚，需要有更多的数据来验证已有的理论。因此，我们需要在太阳上黑斑活动最大的今年，连续测量地磁每日的改变，并注意它和日斑的关系。
    对宇宙射线的观测。宇宙射线是从天外飞到地面上来的具有高能量的粒子，有些粒子所具有的能量远远超过世界上最大加速器所能获得的能量。它们的穿透力极强，可以贯穿几公尺厚的钢板。我们对宇宙射线的性能虽有初步认识，但对它们的来源，仍是一个没有猜着的谜。有人认为它们是从遥远地方的星云来的，因而在宇宙内是各向同性的；但也有人认为它们属于银河系。因此，我们需要更多的实验数据来验证不同的理论。我们需要在不同的地方和不同的高度进行测量，借以推导地磁和离子层所生的影响。
    对地震的观测。地震常常给人类带来生命和财产的损失。地震的原因可能是火山的爆发，地层的断裂或陷落，因而产生大振幅的地壳振动，以波动形式向各方传播。如能在地震前发出警报，将可以减少它的为害。但如何正确地预告地震的发生，也是地球物理年中研究的对象。
    对海洋的观测。在海洋物理中，我们将寻求海洋中深水环流的原因、长周期和短周期水平面的升降和风及大气压力的关系，分析海浪的频谱，从而研究它生成的物理过程和风的影响。如何利用气象中的数据预报海浪的大小和状况，这不只是对沿海居民的安危有关，对国防也十分重要。海面上的温度可以用飞机上携带的热敏半导体精确的测得，这将有助于了解热量的交换问题。
    对宇宙间的微尘及陨石的观测。空间有许多微尘，它们是研究宇宙来源的线索；和陨石一样，它们都对人造卫星的飞行有影响。我们可以用人造卫星上携带的微音器测量它们的多少和大小。
    以上，所提到的只是地球物理年研究项目的一部分，其他要研究的科学项目还有很多，如冰川、离子层、经纬度、气象、地形和重力等等。
    总之，在这次国际地球物理年中，所要研究的项目很多，研究规模也很大。这项工作，将在科学史上留下重要的一页。全世界科学工作者，现在正满怀信心地期待着科学上的丰收。
    我国已于1955年正式参加了国际地球物理年中的观测工作。除已经组成了国际地球物理年中华人民共和国国家委员会领导这项工作外，还派代表出席了在比利时、苏联和西班牙举行的有关地球物理年的会议。在我国已按经纬度分布，建立了许多气象站和观测站，准备对我国参加的七个学科项目（即地磁、地震、太阳黑斑的活动、宇宙射线、离子层、经纬度测量及气象学）进行测量。
    但令人遗憾的是，国际地球物理年专门委员会执行局，无理的又承认了所谓“台北中国科学院”作为中国国际地球物理年委员会（台北）。此事已引起广大科学工作者的愤慨。我国国际地球物理年国家委员会主席竺可桢已打电报给国际地球物理年专门委员会主席查普曼提出严重抗议。
