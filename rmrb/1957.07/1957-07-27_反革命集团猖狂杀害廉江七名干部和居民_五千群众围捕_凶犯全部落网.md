Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26th - Xinhua News Agency reporter He Xing reports: A serious counter-revolutionary murder case occurred in Yatang Market, Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province, in which seven state organ cadres, their family members, and residents were brutally murdered.

The incident occurred on July 12th. This day was the market day in Yatang. The principal culprits, Luo Jirun and Li Shaohan, led other murderers to act violently at 4:00 PM, while some state cadres at the market were having dinner. One murderer ran into the grain station and first cut the telephone line with a knife, then stabbed a cadre present to death. Grain station accountant Guo Furu was shot by a murderer, but struggled to run out to organize people to fight back. However, he was brutally murdered by the counter-revolutionaries, dying after being stabbed seventeen times all over his body. Grain station director Dai Yixing was also wounded and fought with the murderers, but was eventually killed. Luo Xiuying, a family member of a tax station cadre, was eating with a child when a murderer stabbed her in the abdomen. Bleeding profusely, she struggled to feed the crying child, and the murderer cruelly killed the mother with a knife. Another female worker at a restaurant who was tidying up was also killed. Two cadres from the food company and the supply and marketing cooperative were also killed at the same time.

After committing the murders, this group of counter-revolutionaries also robbed some RMB, government bonds, and grain coupons on the spot.

At that time, militiamen from Mishan Village near Yatang Market discovered this counter-revolutionary murder case. They immediately assembled urgently to pursue the counter-revolutionaries. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the criminals fled in disarray. The masses from nearby villages also surrounded the scene from all directions after hearing the news. The militiamen of Mishan Village bravely tracked and pursued this group of criminals, and soon captured three murderers. A farmer carrying two empty baskets met a murderer head-on. Hearing a group of people behind the murderer shouting "Catch the bandits," he put down the bamboo baskets, picked up a carrying pole, and shouted, catching a murderer. Wherever the murderers ran, they encountered angry masses who besieged them. The masses of Yantang Village, an old revolutionary base area, turned out in full force, climbing mountains and wading through water to pursue and arrest them. Liao Fazhen, the secretary of the CCP branch, fought the murderers hand-to-hand with the masses and captured six murderers on the spot. According to estimates by relevant authorities in Lianjiang County, as many as five thousand people pursued the counter-revolutionary murderers that afternoon. By the 13th, all the counter-revolutionary murderers had been arrested, with no one escaping.

The Lianjiang County public security organs and relevant departments are now interrogating this counter-revolutionary group regarding the murder case.

    反革命集团猖狂杀害廉江七名干部和居民
    五千群众围捕　凶犯全部落网
    新华社广州26日电　新华社记者何星报道：广东省廉江县雅塘墟发生一件严重的反革命凶杀案件，国家机关干部和家属、居民七人惨遭杀害。
    事情发生在7月12日。这一天是雅塘的墟期（赶集日）。主犯罗纪润、李绍汉率领其他凶手，在下午四时乘墟上一些国家干部正在吃晚饭的时候，突然行凶。一个凶犯跑进粮站内，先用刀切断电话线，跟着就刺死了在场的一个干部。粮站会计郭福如被凶犯枪伤后，还挣扎着跑出去准备组织人来反击，但他遭到了反革命分子的凶杀，他全身被刺十七刀后死去。粮站主任戴义兴负伤后也和凶犯们搏斗，最后被杀害。税站干部家属罗秀英正带一个小孩在吃饭，凶犯向她腹部刺了一刀，鲜血直流，她还挣扎着给啼哭的小孩吃奶，凶犯残酷地再用刀杀害了这个母亲。另一个正在收拾物件的饭店女工也被杀死。同时被杀害的还有食品公司和供销社的两个干部。
    这一批反革命分子杀人后还就地抢去了一些人民币和公债券、粮票等。
    当时，雅塘墟附近?山村的民兵发觉了这一反革命杀人案件，他们立即紧急集合，追击这批反革命分子。凶犯们看到情势不好，便狼狈溃逃。附近村庄的群众闻讯后也从四面八方向出事地点围了上来。?山村民兵勇敢地跟踪追击这伙凶犯，不久捕获了三个凶手。一个农民挑着两个空箩和一个凶犯迎面相遇。他听到凶犯后面一群人喊“捉土匪”的声音，放下竹箩，拿起扁担一喝，就捉住了一个凶犯。凶犯们跑到那里，都遇到了愤怒的群众围攻。革命老根据地烟塘村的群众倾村出动，爬山涉水进行追捕，中共支部书记廖发珍和群众一道同凶犯们徒手搏斗，当场捉住了六个凶犯。据廉江县有关机关估计，当天下午追捕反革命凶犯的群众达五千人。到13日，全部反革命杀人犯都被逮捕，无一漏网。
    现在廉江县公安机关和有关部门，正在审讯这个反革命集团的凶杀案件。
