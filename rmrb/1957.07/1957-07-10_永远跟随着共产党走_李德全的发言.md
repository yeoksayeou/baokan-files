In the eight years since liberation, our country has undergone earth-shaking changes. Before liberation, workers lived lives worse than cattle and horses. After liberation, the working class became the leaders of the People's Republic of China, not only changing their own lives but also changing the face of the entire China. The speed of China's industrial development is such that even the enemy cannot deny that China is number one in the world. Since the European industrial revolution, our country has been an oppressed and exploited semi-colonial and semi-feudal underdeveloped agricultural country. Eight years ago today, we had almost nothing in terms of industry; at that time, we would not even have dreamed that we would achieve such brilliant results in socialist industrialization today. The working class has not only displayed the attitude of masters in the economic field, but has also played the most pioneering role in every great political movement in New China. This struggle against the rightists also began with the broad masses of the working class.

Thanks to the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance and the leadership of the working class, the broad masses of peasants have not only experienced fundamental changes in their lives, but especially after the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, they have gradually transformed socialism into their real lives.

The broad masses of intellectuals have received education in Marxism-Leninism in every great movement, especially in the ideological remolding movement. Under the leadership of the Party, our country's scientific and cultural undertakings have reached unprecedented prosperity. The intellectuals themselves are also undergoing profound changes, transforming from bourgeois intellectuals into intellectuals of the working class and laboring people. With the great achievements of economic and cultural construction, our country's international prestige is increasing day by day. All of this shows that with the leadership of the Communist Party and the goal of heading towards socialism, the law of development in our country's life will forever move from victory to victory. Achievements are always the main thing in all areas of our national life. Isn't this a miracle? Who can deny this ironclad fact?

This point has been vividly and powerfully illustrated by the reports of Premier Zhou and other responsible comrades of government departments. The people of the whole country are jubilant and proud of our achievements, but the insane right-wing ambitious schemers, not only turn a blind eye to our achievements, but also harbor unparalleled hatred and viciously slander the leadership of the Communist Party as a "Party-run world," claiming that the "three evils" are produced by the proletarian dictatorship, etc., clamoring for the Communist Party to step down and to replace the socialist system with a bourgeois system. This rampant attack on the Party and the people has aroused immense anger among the people of the whole country.

The hearts of the Chinese people are linked with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Since the beginning of history, no political party has united the broadest masses of the people and correctly pointed out the goal of struggle like the Communist Party. No members of any other party have such a high degree of class consciousness, selflessness, self-sacrifice, and dedication to serving the people like the Communist Party members. They are connected with the broad masses, care about the suffering of the masses, and are willing to accept criticism and correct mistakes. This noble quality cannot be measured by the moral standards of any class society.

Since its establishment, the Chinese Communist Party has suffered cruel suppression from powerful enemies at home and abroad in the dark ruling years of the past. No one knows how many arduous struggles it has experienced, how many revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed themselves, and how they have carried the sacred torch of revolution to the whole country, finally winning national victory. Today, the great unity of the Chinese people and our prosperous and happy life are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Our Party is not satisfied with such great achievements and continues to strengthen its struggle for socialism and communism. Therefore, it is even more necessary to rectify and purify the Party's ranks to meet this more arduous and more onerous glorious task. May I ask, which political party can have such a broad mind and be so loyal to the people's cause as the Communist Party? Precisely because we have such a Party and leader, our friends are all over the world, and progressives and fraternal communist parties around the world respect the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao with unparalleled feelings. Chairman Mao's article on the contradictions among the people has become an important ideological weapon for the Chinese people to build socialism. The Chinese people have the leadership of such a glorious and great Communist Party and such a brilliant leader as Chairman Mao. This is our infinite glory and happiness, and it is also the unprecedented glory and happiness of the Chinese people. How can we not cherish our Party and protect our Party as we cherish our lives?

This rectification movement is a serious test for the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country, especially the workers and peasants, have shown their infinite loyalty and love for the Party. Only a very few ambitious schemers with ulterior motives have exposed their true colors and are spurned by the broad masses of the people. Rightists! I want to warn you: "Rein in at the precipice, turn back to the shore, lay down the butcher knife, and become a Buddha on the spot." You should wake up in time and not isolate yourselves from the people. Those who are not firm in their positions in the rectification, and who were temporarily misled by the rightists, should deeply accept this lesson, actively participate in the struggle against the rightists, thoroughly transform themselves, firm their positions, and resolutely take the socialist road. This vigorous anti-rightist struggle has given each of us an extremely profound class education. Passing the socialist test is a process that every Chinese person must go through. At this critical juncture, we must not fall down, nor are we allowed to carry the baggage of the bourgeoisie into socialist society. The wheel of history cannot be resisted by any force. If we want to keep up with the times, we can only sincerely support the Communist Party and always follow the Party.

    永远跟随着共产党走
    李德全的发言
    解放八年来，我们国家已经起了天翻地覆的改变。工人们在解放前过着牛马不如的生活，解放后，工人阶级成了中华人民共和国领导者，不仅是改变了自己的生活，而且改变了整个中国的面貌。中国工业发展的速度连敌人也不能不承认中国是全世界的第一位。自从欧洲工业革命以来，我国一直是受压迫、受剥削的半殖民地半封建的农业不发达的国家。八年前的今天，在工业方面我们几乎是一无所有，当时连梦也不会想到今天在社会主义的工业化上取得了这样辉煌的成绩。工人阶级不只在经济方面发挥了主人翁的态度，在新中国历次的伟大政治运动中都起最先锋的带头作用。这次反右派的斗争，也是从广大工人阶级群众开始的。
    广大农民由于有工农联盟的基础和工人阶级的领导，不只生活上有了根本的改变，尤其在农业合作化运动高潮后，已经逐渐地把社会主义变成了他们现实的生活。
    广大的知识分子在历次伟大的运动中，特别是在思想改造的运动中受到了马列主义的教育，在党的领导下，使我国的科学文化事业达到空前的繁荣。知识分子本身也正在经历着深刻的变化，由资产阶级知识分子转变为工农劳动人民的知识分子。随着经济文化建设的伟大成就，使我国的国际威望与日俱增。所有这一切说明了我们的事业有了共产党的领导，有了奔向社会主义的目标，我国生活发展的规律将永远是从胜利走向胜利。成绩在我们国家生活的一切领域里永远是主要的东西，这难道不是奇迹么？谁能否认这个铁一般的事实呢？
    从周总理和其他政府部门负责同志的报告中都生动有力的说明了这一点。全国人民都为我们的成绩欢欣鼓舞，感到自豪，但是丧心病狂的右派野心家，不但对我们的成绩熟视无睹，反而怀着无比的仇恨，并且恶毒地污蔑共产党的领导是“党天下”，“三害”是由于无产阶级专政产生的等等狂言乱语，主张要共产党下台，要拿资产阶级制度代替社会主义制度，这种向党和人民的猖狂进攻已经引起了全国人民无比的愤怒。
    中国人民的心是和共产党和毛主席联在一起的。自有史以来，没有任何政党像共产党这样团结了最广大的人民正确地指出奋斗的目标，也没有任何党派的成员像共产党员那样高度的阶级觉悟，大公无私，自我牺牲，全心全意为人民服务的精神。他们联系着广大群众，关心群众的疾苦，并且勇于接受批评，改正错误。这种高贵的品质是任何阶级社会的道德标准所不能衡量的。
    中国共产党从成立以来在过去黑暗统治的年代里受着内外强大敌人的残酷镇压，不知经历了多少艰苦奋斗，牺牲了多少革命先烈，前仆后继把神圣革命的火炬高举到全国，终于获得了全国的胜利。今天我们中国人民的大团结，我们的繁荣幸福生活都是与共产党和毛主席的领导分不开的。我们的党并没有为这样大的成绩而满足，还在继续加强为社会主义、为共产主义而奋斗。因此更要整刷纯洁党的队伍来迎接这个更艰苦、更繁重的光荣任务。请问有那一个政党能够像共产党这样的胸怀远大，忠于人民的事业呢？正因为我们有这样的党和领袖，我们的朋友遍于全世界，全世界的进步人士们和兄弟国家共产党，都以无比的心情尊重中国共产党和毛主席。毛主席论人民内部矛盾的文章已经成为全中国人民建设社会主义的重要思想武器。中国人民有这样光荣伟大的共产党的领导，有这样英明的领袖毛主席，这是我们无限的光荣和幸福，也是中国人民有史以来没有的光荣和幸福。我们怎能不像爱护我们的生命一样来爱护我们的党，保护我们的党呢？
    在这次整风运动中对全国人民来说都是一次严重的考验。全国人民，首先是工人和农民表现出对党的无限忠诚和热爱，只有极少数别有用心的野心家暴露了他们的原形而为广大人民所唾弃。右派分子们！我要警告你们：“悬崖勒马，回头是岸，放下屠刀，立地成佛。”你们应该及时猛醒，不要自绝于人民。在整风中有些立场不坚定的人，一时受了右派分子的迷惑，更应该深刻接受这次的教训，积极投入反右派的斗争中，彻底改造自己，坚定自己的立场，坚决走社会主义的道路。这次轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，使我们每个人都受到一次极为深刻的阶级教育。过社会主义这一关是每一个中国人必须经历的过程，在这个紧要的关口上，既不能倒下来，又不允许背着资产阶级的包袱到社会主义社会里去，历史的车轮是任何力量所不能抗拒的，如果要跟上时代，只有真心诚意地拥护共产党，永远跟着党走。
