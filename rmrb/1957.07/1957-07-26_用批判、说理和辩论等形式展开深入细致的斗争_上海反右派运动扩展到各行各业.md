    Expanding the Anti-Rightist Movement to All Sectors Through In-Depth and Detailed Struggle in the Form of Criticism, Reasoning, and Debate
    Shanghai's Anti-Rightist Movement Expands to All Trades and Professions
    (Our Shanghai dispatch, July 25) Our reporter Ji Yin, summarizing the situation of the anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai, says:
    The Shanghai people's struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements has been going on for a month and a half. This unprecedentedly intense and complex political struggle, provoked by right-wing elements, is now being promoted more and more widely and deeply into all walks of life. In this city, which was once the most developed in China in terms of capitalism, more and more people are rising to defend the hard-won fruits of socialism and repelling the attacks of bourgeois right-wing elements.
    Since the counterattack against the Rightists began in Shanghai in early June, the main force has been directed at the Shanghai Rightist clique and other key Rightist elements linked to the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Beijing. There are about thirty such key elements, and although they are small in number, they have done great harm. The anti-socialist backlash that swept through Shanghai in May was created by them. After a month and a half of struggle, people now see these figures more clearly in terms of their identities and origins. Most of these Rightists in Shanghai have existed for a long time, and they generally fall into three categories: one is the right-wing elements in the democratic parties during the democratic revolution. Historically, they have always played the role of anti-communist and anti-people counter-revolutionaries, with intricate ties to imperialism and the Kuomintang. For example, Rao Jiangchen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, Wang Zaoshi, Sun Dayu and others, who are Shanghai Rightists, belong to this category. Another type is the power-holders during the Kuomintang rule in the past, such as Lu Mang, Yang Zhaolong, and Xu Zhongnian. They held high positions and were prominent in the reactionary years before liberation. Anti-communism and anti-people were even more their profession. The third type is those who have stains in their history, who have been criticized and struggled against by the masses in ideological remolding, counter-revolutionary suppression, and other political movements, but they have not repented at all, but instead harbor resentment. Or they are deeply poisoned by bourgeois ideas, and their personal status and desire for ambition cannot be satisfied, and finally they develop political dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. Some of these three types of people combine several of these characteristics, being both right-wing politicians and personal careerists. Among the three types, the first type often plays a leading, organizing, and inciting role. In recent years, they have actually become the spokespersons of capitalism, and have never stopped their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. When encountering major political movements, political events, or important meetings, they take the opportunity to spread reactionary fallacies and stir up evil winds. After the Hungarian incident, they were nervous for a while, hoping to sweep the storm on the streets of Budapest to Shanghai, but the Party promptly strengthened political and ideological education to the masses and refuted the fallacies of the Rightists, crushing their attempts.
    The Party has repeatedly given these Rightists advice, pointing out the danger of their mistakes, and advising them to turn over a new leaf and correct their mistakes. Even when the Rightist Sun Dayu frantically attacked the Party's leadership and viciously slandered dozens of Party cadres as "counter-revolutionaries" at the Shanghai CPPCC meeting last year, the responsible comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee repeatedly talked to him, explaining the righteousness, hoping that he would withdraw his erroneous speech and apologize to the comrades he had slandered. The Party also adopted the method of persuasion and education for other Rightists, hoping to solve the problem by resolving the contradictions among the people, but they were perfunctory on the surface and had no intention of repenting in their hearts. And now it has been found that some of the Rightists secretly combined as early as last summer and carried out activities in a planned way, either using legal forums such as local CPPCC meetings to pick on the Party's work and stir up trouble, or conducting "arson" at the grassroots level in the name of democratic parties.
    After the launch of the rectification movement by the Shanghai Party organization, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee successively held symposiums with people from all walks of life, humbly listened to the opinions of all strata, and at the same time began to improve its work. Democratic life was active, the masses were in high spirits, and everything was normal. But in the later stage, the rightists, blinded by profit, started an anti-Party wildfire. They completely ignored the principles repeatedly put forward by the Party regarding rectification and handling contradictions among the people, and forced the rectification to deviate from the right track, causing fluctuations in many universities, institutions, groups and factories. At this time, the Party had to free up its hands to deal with them. The Rightists mistakenly assessed the situation and finally went from a full-scale offensive to a full-scale exposure. These gentlemen who attempted to trap the Communists in " besieged from all sides" unexpectedly quickly fell into the encirclement of the masses.
    The Shanghai working masses, who are rich in class struggle experience, fully demonstrated in this struggle that they are the most conscious class. They were the first to rise up to counterattack the Rightists' offensive, and at the same time sounded the alarm for the people of the city. Many middle-of-the-road masses initially felt confused and unprepared for this struggle. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee separately held dozens of symposiums and report meetings, repeatedly consulting with tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, especially intellectuals, explaining the differences between the Communists and the Rightists and the necessity of carrying out this struggle, and gradually attracting them into the struggle. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always regarded uniting and winning over the middle masses as one of the most important tasks. The Municipal Party Committee organized responsible Party members from various departments to conduct extensive individual visits to the middle masses to listen to their opinions.
    Because the exposure of the Rightists in Shanghai's anti-Rightist struggle was relatively thorough, the political and ideological criticism was relatively thorough, and the mobilization of the middle masses was relatively good, the Rightists were forced to bow their heads and confess their guilt to the people. On the 1st of this month, Lu Yi, the "military advisor" of the Shanghai Rightist clique, was the first to be broken through, initially revealing the dark inside story of the Rightist clique, and confessing many facts of the Rightists' planned, organized, and division-of-labor offensive against the Party. The publication of a large number of shocking materials educated the people, boosted morale, and also shook the Rightists. Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, Wang Zaoshi and other key Rightists initially pretended to be calm, thinking that the Communist Party was just "a gust of wind", and after dodging this gust of wind, the world would still be theirs, but in the end they had to bow their heads one by one in the face of the facts. Their prestige has been defeated and they have been isolated among the masses.
    The anti-Rightist struggle in Shanghai has now entered a new stage of deeper development on the basis of the past. The characteristics of this new stage are: the struggle is being further extended from the initial concentration of the main force to counterattack key Rightist elements to many aspects such as news, publishing, music, art, literature, government agencies, and mass organizations, and at the same time, the struggle is being carried out in depth. The form of the struggle is also changing from the initial vigorous counterattack to a more in-depth and detailed criticism, reasoning, and debate. The form of debate is being adopted by various departments, and in universities such as Fudan University, face-to-face debates are being held with the Rightists' certain reactionary arguments, with good results. With the deepening of the struggle, the number of Rightists has also increased. From outside the Party to inside the Party, some new Rightist figures have been exposed, and many anti-Party arguments with various trademarks have been discovered. More and more masses are joining this great socialist revolutionary movement.
    Looking back at the development of the entire struggle in Shanghai over the past month and a half, it still appears unbalanced, and the exposure of the Rightists is also unbalanced. In addition to objective reasons, the main reason is that the Party leaders in some units did not dare to let the poisonous weeds come out when "airing views", and they did not fully understand the fundamental fact that more than 90% of the masses are good people, and exaggerated the harm of the poisonous weeds, thus hindering the growth of the poisonous weeds. The struggle in these units is now lukewarm, and these comrades now regret it very much. The facts show that the Rightists' remarks do not have much confusing effect on the masses, their capital is very limited, and they cannot withstand the criticism of the masses. These units are now taking remedial measures to launch the movement.

    用批判、说理和辩论等形式展开深入细致的斗争
    上海反右派运动扩展到各行各业
    本报上海25日电　本报记者季音综述上海反右派斗争的形势说：
    上海人民反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争，已进行了一个半月了。这场由右派分子挑动起来的空前激烈、复杂的政治斗争，现在正愈来愈广泛、深入地推广到各行各业。在这座曾是我国资本主义最发达的城市里，越来越多的人民正在起来保卫已得的社会主义的胜利果实，击退资产阶级右派分子的进攻。
    上海从6月上旬反击右派以来，首先以主要力量反击了与北京章罗联盟有联系的上海右派集团及其他右派骨干分子，这类骨干分子大约有三十名左右，他们数量虽少，但为害甚大。5月间上海卷起的一股反社会主义的逆流，就是他们一手制造出来的。经过一个半月来的斗争，现在人们对这些人物的面目和来历，已看得更清楚了。上海的这些右派分子多数存在已久，他们大致上有这么三种类型，一种是民主革命时期民主党派中的右翼分子，他们在历史上就一直是扮演反共反人民的反派角色的，与帝国主义和国民党之间有千丝万缕的关系，例如上海右派的饶将陈仁炳、彭文应、王造时、孙大雨等人，就属于这一类。另一种是过去国民党统治时期的当权派，如鲁莽、杨兆龙、徐仲年等人，他们在解放前的反动年代中都身居高位，声势显赫，反共反人民更是他们的本行。第三种是历史上有污点、在思想改造、肃反等政治运动中被群众批评和斗争过，但他们毫不改悔，反而怀恨在心。或者资产阶级思想中毒很深，个人地位欲望的野心不能满足，最后发展到从政治上对党对政府不满。这三种人中，有些人兼而有之，既是右翼政客，又是个人野心家。三种人中，第一类人往往起着领导、组织和煽动的作用。几年来，他们实际上成了资本主义的代言人，始终没有停止过反党反社会主义的活动，在遇到重大政治运动、政治事件或重要会议时，便乘隙活动，散布反动谬论，掀起一股歪风。匈牙利事件发生后，他们曾经紧张了一阵，希图把布达佩斯街头的风暴刮到上海来，但党及时地对群众加强了政治思想教育，对右派分子的谬论进行了驳斥，粉碎了他们的企图。
    党曾经一再地对这些右派分子提出过忠告，指出他们错误的危险性，奉劝他们洗心革面，改正错误。甚至像右派分子孙大雨在去年上海政协会议上疯狂地攻击党的领导，恶毒地诬蔑数十个党的干部为“反革命分子”的时候，上海市委负责同志还一再找他谈话，晓以大义，希望他收回错误的发言，向受到他诬蔑的同志道歉。对其他右派分子，党也采取了说服教育的办法，希望能用解决人民内部矛盾的方法来解决，但是他们表面上敷衍，内心则毫无悔改之意。而现在已查明，右派中的一部分人远在去年夏天已秘密结合起来，有计划地展开活动，或则利用地方政协会议等合法讲坛，挑党的工作中的毛病，掀风作浪，或则以民主党派的名义在基层进行“纵火”。
    上海党组织的整风运动展开后，上海市委连续召开各界座谈会，虚心听取各阶层的意见，同时着手改进工作，民主生活活跃，群众情绪很高，一切都很正常。但是到后期，利令智昏的右派野心分子烧起了一把反党野火，他们完全不顾党一再提出的关于整风和处理人民内部矛盾的原则，强使整风离开了正当的轨道，使许多高等学校、机关团体和工厂都受到波动，这时候，党不得不腾出手来对付他们。右派分子们错误地估计了形势，终于由全面进攻而全面暴露了。这些企图陷共产党人以“四面楚歌”的先生们，出乎意外地很快就落进了人民群众的包围之中。
    富有阶级斗争经验的上海工人群众，在这次斗争中充分表现了他们是最有觉悟的阶级，他们最先起来回击右派的进攻，同时也给全市人民敲响了警钟。许多中间群众最初对这个斗争曾感到迷惑与缺乏准备，上海市委分别召开了数十次各种座谈会和报告会，与数以万计的各阶层，尤其是知识界的人士反复商量，说明共产党人和右派分子的分歧，和开展这个斗争的必要，逐步把他们吸引到斗争中来。中共上海市委始终把团结与争取中间群众列为最重要的工作之一，市委曾组织了各部门党员负责人广泛地向中间群众进行个别访问，倾听意见。
    上海反右派分子的斗争，由于对右派的揭露比较充分，从政治上、思想上的批判比较彻底，中间群众的发动比较好，迫使右派分子不得不向人民低头伏罪。本月1日，上海右派集团的“军师”陆诒，第一个被突破，初步揭开了右派集团的黑暗内幕，交代了右派分子有计划、有组织、有分工地向党进攻的许多事实，大量触目惊心的材料的公布，教育了人民，鼓舞了斗志，也动摇了右派分子，陈仁炳、彭文应、王造时等右派骨干最初都强作镇定，以为共产党就是“一阵风”，躲过这阵风，还是他的天下，但是最后都不得不一个个在事实面前低头，他们的威风已经打垮，在群众中已经孤立。
    上海反右派斗争现在已在过去的基础上进入一个更深入发展的新阶段，这个新阶段的特点是：斗争正由初期的集中主要力量反击右派骨干分子，而进一步扩展到新闻、出版、音乐、美术、文学、政府机关、群众团体等许多方面，同时地把斗争深入开展起来。斗争的方式也正由运动初期声势浩大的反击，进入到更深入、细致的批判、说理，辩论会的形式正在被各部门所采用，复旦大学等高等学校里以辩论会的形式，与右派分子的若干反动论点展开面对面的论争，成效很好。随着斗争的深入，右派分子的数量也有增加，从党外到党内，都揭发出了一些新的右派人物，发现了许多贴着各式商标的反党论点。愈来愈多的群众，正在投入这个伟大的社会主义革命运动。
    回顾上海一个半月来，整个斗争的发展还显得不平衡，右派分子暴露得也不平衡。这除了客观上的原因外，主要是有些单位党的领导人在“鸣放”时不敢放手让毒草出笼，他们对百分之九十以上的群众是好人这个根本事实认识不足，夸大了毒草的危害性，因而阻碍了毒草的生长，这些单位现在斗争也就冷冷清清，这些同志现在都很后悔。事实说明，右派言论对群众的迷惑作用并不大，他们的本钱很有限，是经不起群众的批驳的。现在这些单位正在采取补课办法，把运动开展起来。
