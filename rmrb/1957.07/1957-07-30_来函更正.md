    Letter of Correction
    Comrade Su Yu writes: My original article "Fragments Before and After the Nanchang Uprising" was written for the "PLA's Thirty Years of徵文 [征文 means solicit article]" campaign. Its main content is to reflect, through the situation of the 24th Division's Training Corps before and after the Nanchang Uprising, that young students must undergo a long period of revolutionary training in order to gradually overcome the weakness of relying solely on enthusiasm while lacking a strong revolutionary fighting spirit, thereby establishing a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people, becoming staunch revolutionary fighters, shedding the casualness of liberalism, and becoming members of an organized and disciplined revolutionary team. Therefore, the initial title was "The 24th Division's Training Corps Before and After the Nanchang Uprising." Later, at the suggestion of comrades, some content was added, and it was written as "Fragments Before and After the Nanchang Uprising." When your newspaper published it on July 25, the title was changed to "Before and After the Nanchang Uprising," omitting the most important word "Fragments." This not only does not conform to the content of the article, but also easily leads readers to mistakenly believe that the Nanchang Uprising was that simple, etc. Therefore, please make a correction, and I hope that this letter will be published at the same time, so as to help readers understand the original intention of the article.

    来函更正
    粟裕大将来信：我原来写的“南昌起义前后片断”一文，是为“解放军三十年征文”而作。其主要内容是通过当时的二十四师教导队在南昌起义前后的情况，反映出青年学生，必须经过长时期的革命锻炼，才能逐渐克服单凭一股热情而缺乏坚强的革命斗志的弱点，从而确立为人民服务的革命人生观，成为意志坚定的革命战士，去掉散漫的自由主义，成为有组织、有纪律的革命队伍中的成员。所以初拟的题目是“南昌起义前后的二十四师教导队”，后经同志们的提议，又增加了一些内容，才写成“南昌起义前后片断”。贵报7月25日发表时，改为“南昌起义前后”，将最重要的“片断”二字删掉，这样不仅与本文内容不符，且易引起读者以为南昌起义即如此简单等等误会。因此，请予更正，并盼将此信同时刊登，以便有助于读者们了解本文的原意。
