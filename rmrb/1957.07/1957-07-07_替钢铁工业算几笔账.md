Calculating Accounts for the Steel Industry
　　Fan Rongkang
The steel industry is often regarded as a measuring tool to gauge the level of a country's entire industry. When rightist elements clamor that China's industrialization is "messed up" and slander that "achievements are primary" is "new stereotyped writing," we are willing to calculate a few accounts for the steel industry to measure whether our country's industrialization is "messed up" or done well, and whether the achievements are indeed primary?
　　　　Speed
First, let's calculate the development speed.
The history of China's modern steel industry began in 1890 with Zhang Zhidong's creation of the Hanyang Iron Works. 1943 was the year with the highest steel industry output in old China's history, with a total steel output of over 900,000 tons. From 1890 to 1943, over fifty years, more than 900,000 tons of annual output—this is the development speed of the old Chinese steel industry and the level it reached.
Over fifty years, more than 900,000 tons of annual output is already pathetic enough. But even this figure is an illusion because eight or nine out of ten of these 900,000 tons of annual output came from Japanese enterprises in China. As for China's own steel industry, whether it was government-run or privately owned, it had been languishing for a long time.
Here, some specific materials can be cited to illustrate the situation in the past.
In 1935, the book "China's Industrial Self-Sufficiency Plan" published by the China Book Company, listed and introduced the situation of various steel plants at that time. This table listed six factories. Hanyang Iron Works of Hanyeping Company was "suspended for many years and has not resumed work," Shanghai Hexing Steel Factory was also "suspended for many years and has not resumed work," Shanghai Steel Factory was "now suspended," Hanyang Arsenal was "although steel furnaces have been built for many years, they have not been smelted," Taiyuan Yucai Steel Factory was "suspended," and the last column was Shenyang Arsenal, "after the Northeast Incident, it is no longer ours." The author's conclusion is: "Looking at the above factories' production capacity of steel ingots, it is about 110,000 tons per year, but they are all suspended, and there are no domestically produced steel products that can be purchased on the market."
In 1946, the article "China's Steel Industry in the Past Eight Years of the War of Resistance" published in the first and second combined issues of the "Resources Committee Quarterly" introduced the situation of various steel plants during the War of Resistance. Hanyang and Daye factories of Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company "have been suspended for a long time due to economic difficulties and loan burdens," the Shijingshan Iron Plant "never started production after its blast furnace and auxiliary equipment were completed," and the Northwest Industrial Company's steel plant, although "close to success, failed to produce due to the sudden incident." As for the Central Iron and Steel Plant, which the Kuomintang boasted about, it "was attacked before the plant was built." According to the author, only some small factories were maintaining production at that time, with an annual output of pig iron of about 20,000 tons and an annual output of steel of about 40,000 tons, while "the two factories in Anshan and Benxi in the Northeast, although they have a large amount of steel production, are all seized by the Japanese and cannot be used by our Chinese nation." After describing some small steel enterprises established in the southwestern provinces during the War of Resistance, the author wrote with great emotion: "The simplicity of our country's steel industry equipment, the small output, and the lack of resources are far behind Europe and the United States, and even compared with Japan, it is far behind."
By the eve of liberation, the steel industry was like a flickering candle. In 1947, the national pig iron output was only 144,000 tons, and the steel output was only 70,000 tons.
During the three-year period of national economic recovery, we restored the production of the steel industry on the ruins of almost nothing. In 1952, the last year of the economic recovery period, the annual steel output reached 1.35 million tons, exceeding the historical peak of more than 900,000 tons of steel reached after more than fifty years before liberation by 46%. In the fourth year of the First Five-Year Plan, the steel output reached 4.465 million tons, an increase of more than 3 million tons compared with 1952, which is more than doubled. The speed of development of the steel industry in the three years of recovery and four years of construction is vastly different from that of the old China for more than fifty years.
　　　　Self-Sufficiency Rate
Let's look at the self-sufficiency rate of steel. "Self-sufficiency" is a symbol of economic independence. For many years, the Chinese people have been dreaming of industrial self-sufficiency. The book "China's Industrial Self-Sufficiency Plan" published by the China Book Company concentrates some Chinese people's hopes for the self-sufficiency of various industrial products and their proposed "plans." According to this book, at that time, China "consumed about 600,000 tons of steel raw materials every year," and an annual consumption of 600,000 tons was originally insignificant, but "90% of it had to be supplied by foreigners." The statistics of imported steel materials from the false customs quoted in the book paint us a picture of a colony. In 1928 and 1929, the imported steel materials were more than 600,000 tons, and in 1930 and 1931, the imported steel materials were also more than 500,000 tons. These included common small steel, iron wire, tinplate, screws, small nails, etc. At that time, foreign steel rails were laid on our land, foreign steel was erected on our bridges, foreign spindles were turning in our textile factories, and even in our people's homes, the stoves for heating in winter were fitted with chimneys made of foreign thin steel plates...
In the past few years, New China has been carrying out large-scale economic construction, and the consumption of steel has been increasing day by day, and 600,000 tons can no longer solve the problem. However, our country's steel self-sufficiency rate has been increasing year by year. In 1952, the self-sufficiency rate of steel was 60.7%, and in 1956, it had increased to 85%. We used our own produced steel to lay thousands of kilometers of railways, erected the eye-catching Yangtze River Bridge, erected ultra-high-voltage power transmission line towers extending hundreds of kilometers, built many new factories, and produced many new equipment. Comparing the past with the present, isn't it a thorough slander to say that industrialization is "messed up"?
　　　　Variety
The ability to produce how many types of steel and steel products is also a standard for evaluating the level of the steel industry. There is no way to find out how many types of steel and steel products old China could produce. In 1952, we could produce more than 180 types of steel, and in 1956, we could produce more than 300 types of steel. Corresponding to the increase in steel types, by 1956, we could produce more than 3,700 specifications of steel products. Aircraft steel and automobile steel are particularly complex, as many people know. By 1956, domestic production could solve 58% of aircraft steel and 69% of automobile steel.
In 1955, we already had our own produced silicon steel sheets, and in 1956, we successfully trial-produced two high-grade silicon steel sheets. The history of complete reliance on imports of silicon steel sheets has ended.
　　Technical Equipment
A comparison of technical equipment can also show the level of the steel industry. In the old Chinese steel industry, a large proportion of blast furnaces were below 70 cubic meters, open-hearth furnaces were below 50 tons, electric furnaces and converters were below 3 tons, and rolling mills were mostly manual and medium and small-sized, and even steam-powered. Chongqing D渡口 Steel Factory was the "largest" steel enterprise that the Kuomintang often boasted about. In fact, this factory only had two ten-ton open-hearth furnaces, one hundred-ton blast furnace, and one twenty-ton blast furnace. The steel industry operated by the Japanese in the Northeast had better technical equipment, but it was only some general mechanized blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, and the largest billet mill in the rolling mill had an annual processing capacity of only 1.2 million tons of steel ingots.
In developing the steel industry, we not only utilized the original medium-sized and small-sized equipment and fully exerted their efficiency, but also built some new and more powerful equipment. We have five automated blast furnaces, automated large rolling mills, seamless steel pipe plants, and a large billet mill with an annual processing capacity of more than 3 million tons of steel ingots. These large metallurgical equipment were things that Chinese metallurgical engineers and technicians did not dare to imagine in the past.
　　　　×　×　×
With these four accounts, it is enough to illustrate the problem.
The development speed of my country's steel industry in just seven years far exceeds that of old China for more than fifty years. This is an ironclad fact. We do not boast about these. We know very well that although the development speed of my country's steel industry is among the best in the world, the output is still very small. It will take a long time to catch up with the level of the United States in terms of steel output per capita in my country. But we will never agree to anyone obliterating the amazing achievements of my country's steel industry and obliterating the hard work of thousands of metallurgical workers and engineering technicians.

    替钢铁工业算几笔账
    范荣康
    钢铁工业，常常被人们当作测量表，来衡量一个国家整个工业的水平。当右派分子叫嚣中国的工业化“搞糟了”，污蔑说“成绩是主要的”是“新八股”的时候，我们愿意替钢铁工业算几笔账，来测量一下我国的工业化究竟是“搞糟了”，还是搞好了，成绩究竟是不是主要的？
          速　　度
    先算发展速度。
    中国近代钢铁工业的历史，是从1890年张之洞创建汉阳铁厂开始的。1943年是旧中国历史上钢铁工业产量最高的一年，那一年的钢产量共九十多万吨。从1890年到1943年，五十多年时间，九十多万吨年产量，这就是旧中国钢铁工业的发展速度和它所达到的水平。
    五十多年时间，九十多万吨年产量，已经是够可怜的了。但就是这个数字也还是一种假象。因为这九十多万吨年产量十之八九产自日本的在华企业。至于中国自己的钢铁工业，不论是官办的也好，是民营的也好，长期以来都是奄奄一息的。
    这里，可以引用一些具体材料来说明过去的情况。
    1935年，中华书局出版的“中国工业自给计划”一书，曾经列表对当时各炼钢厂的情况作了介绍。这份表上列了六个工厂。汉冶萍公司汉阳铁厂是“停工多年尚未复工”，上海和兴钢铁厂也是“停工多年尚未复工”，上海炼钢厂是“现已停顿”，汉阳兵工厂是“钢炉虽建设有年并未开炼”，太原育才钢厂是“停工”，最后一栏是沈阳兵工厂，“东北事变之后，已非我有”。作者的结论是：“综观上述各厂制产钢锭能力，每年约十一万余吨，但现皆停顿，在市场上并无国产钢材可以购买”。
    1946年，“资源委员会季刊”第一、二期合刊所载“抗战八年来之我国钢铁工业”一文，对抗战期间各钢铁厂的情况作了介绍。汉冶萍煤铁公司之汉阳大冶二厂，“以经济困难，贷款拖累，早已停工”，石景山铁厂“其炼铁炉及附属设备完成之后，终未开工”，西北实业公司之钢铁厂，虽然“为山九仞，亦以事变仓卒，未能生产”，至于国民党大吹大擂的中央钢铁厂，则“尚未建厂，即遭事变”。据作者介绍，当时维持生产的，只有一些小厂，生铁年产量约二万多吨，钢的年产量约四万多吨，而“东北之鞍山及本溪两厂，虽有大量之钢铁生产，但俱为日人攫有，非我华夏所能运用”。作者在分述了抗战期间西南诸省建立的一些小型钢铁企业之后，感慨万分地写道：“我国钢铁工业设备之简陋，产量之微小及资源之贫乏，较之欧美，固望尘莫及，即与日本相比，也瞠乎其后。”
    到解放前夕，钢铁工业更如风烛残年。1947年，全国生铁产量才十四万四千吨，钢的产量不过七万吨。
    在三年国民经济恢复时期，我们在几乎是一无所有的废墟上，恢复钢铁工业的生产。1952年，经济恢复时期的最后一年，钢的年产量达到一百三十五万吨，较解放前经过五十多年的时间，达到九十多万吨钢的历史最高水平，超过46％，第一个五年计划的第四年，钢的产量达到四百四十六万五千吨，又较1952年增加了三百多万吨，即增加了两倍多。三年恢复和四年建设中钢铁工业发展的速度，同旧中国五十多年相比，真有天壤之别。
        自　给　率
    再看钢材自给率。“自给”，是经济独立的标志。多少年来中国人都做着工业品自给的美梦。上述中华书局出版的“中国工业自给计划”一书，就集中表现了一些中国人对各种工业品自给的希望和他们所拟定的“计划”。据这本书介绍，当时中国“每年消耗钢铁原料总在六十万吨左右”，一年六十万吨的消耗量本来是微乎其微的，然而“其十分之九且须仰给于外人”。书中引用的伪海关钢铁材料进口的统计数字，更给我们绘出一幅殖民地的图画。1928年和1929年，进口的钢铁材料都在六十万吨以上，1930年和1931年，进口的钢铁材料也有五十多万吨。其中包括常见的小型钢材、铁丝、洋铁皮、螺丝钉、小钉等等。那时候，我国的土地上铺设着外国的钢轨，我国的桥梁上架设着外国的钢材，我国的纺织厂转动着外国的纱锭，连我国人民的家庭里，冬天取暖的火炉上也安着外国薄钢板作成的烟囱……
    新中国几年来进行着大规模的经济建设，钢铁的消耗量与日俱增，早已不是六十万吨能够解决问题的了。可是，我国的钢材自给率却是逐年提高的。1952年钢材的自给率是60.7％，1956年已提高为85％。我们用自己生产的钢材，铺设了数千公里铁路，架起了中外瞩目的长江大桥，竖起了绵延几百公里的超高压送电线铁塔，建设了许多新的工厂，生产了许多新的设备。今昔对比，说工业化“搞糟了”，岂不是彻头彻尾的污蔑吗？
          品　　种
    能生产多少种钢和钢材，也是考核钢铁工业水平的标准。旧中国能生产多少种钢和钢材，这个资料还没有办法找到。1952年，我们能生产一百八十多种钢，1956年，我们已能生产三百多种钢。同钢种的增加相应的，是到1956年已能生产三千七百多种规格的钢材。飞机用钢和汽车用钢特别复杂，这是很多人都知道的。到1956年，飞机用钢国内已能解决58％，汽车用钢已能解决69％。
    1955年，我们已经有了自己生产的矽钢片，1956年又试制成功两种高级的矽钢片。矽钢片全部依靠进口的历史从此结束了。
        技术装备
    从技术装备的比较，也可以看出钢铁工业的水平。旧中国的钢铁工业，很大一部分高炉在七十立方公尺以下，平炉在五十吨以下，电炉和转炉都在三吨以下，轧钢机也大都是手工操作的和中、小型的，甚至还有用蒸汽机传动的。重庆大渡口钢铁厂是国民党常常吹嘘的“规模最大”的钢铁企业。其实这个厂里只有两座十吨平炉、一座一百吨高炉和一座二十吨高炉。日本人在东北经营的钢铁工业，技术装备比较好一些，但也只是些一般的机械化的高炉和平炉，轧钢厂最大的开胚机全年处理钢锭的能力也不过一百二十万吨。
    我们在发展钢铁工业中，不仅把那些原有的中型的和小型的设备利用起来，充分发挥了它们的效率，而且建设了一些新的，威力更强大的设备。我们有了五座自动化的高炉，有了自动化的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂，有了全年能处理钢锭三百多万吨的大型开胚机。这些大型的冶金设备，是中国的冶金工程技术人员过去不敢妄想的。
             ×　×　×
    有了这四笔账，也就足够说明问题了。
    我国钢铁工业在短短七年内的发展速度，远远超过旧中国的五十多年。这是铁一般的事实。对于这些，我们并不自吹自擂。我们深知，尽管我国钢铁工业的发展速度在世界上都是数一数二的，但是产量还是很小的，我国按人口计算的钢产量要赶上美国的水平，还需要长期努力，但是谁要抹煞我国钢铁工业的惊人成就，抹煞千千万万冶金工人和工程技术人员的辛勤劳动，我们决不答应。
