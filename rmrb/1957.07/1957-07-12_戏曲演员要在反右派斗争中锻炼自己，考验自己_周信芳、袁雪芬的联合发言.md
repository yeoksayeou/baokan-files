We wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This speech is the most accurate guide for us in the struggle of socialist construction. We agree with the government work report and various reports from responsible comrades of the government made by Premier Zhou at this meeting. These reports forcefully refuted the anti-Party remarks of the rightists and demonstrated the leap-forward progress and great achievements of the socialist cause under the leadership of the Party.

Facing the rightists' acts of distorting the facts and spreading evil words, we comrades in the opera circles have an unshirkable duty to say a few words.

Let's Settle an Account First

Rightist gentlemen want to "settle old scores" with the Party. We are very "grateful" to them, as this sentence cannot help but evoke our memories of the painful past and remind us of the profound kindness and righteousness that the Party has brought to the opera circles over the past eight years. Looking back on the past and comparing it with the present, anyone with a sense of justice and conscience can clearly calculate this "account."

Each of us suffered from oppression, exploitation, and humiliation in the old society. We couldn't say what we wanted to say, and we couldn't perform the plays we wanted to perform. Take the two of us as an example: the Peking Opera "Emperors Huizong and Qinzong" was banned by Japanese secret agents in collusion with the "Public Works Department," and the Yue Opera "Love of Mountains and Rivers" was "ordered to be suspended" and subjected to various persecutions by the reactionaries. The Kuomintang Gendarmerie Headquarters summoned Zhou Xinfang because he was close to progressive artists, and Yuan Xuefen was splashed with excrement by special agents and gangsters for not succumbing to the Kuomintang's coercion to perform "suppression of rebellion" plays. We are just two of the thousands of people who have been insulted and persecuted.

What about art? Under the rule of the reactionaries, opera art was in decline. Compared with the truly good plays and good performing arts, the popular yellow operas and erotic performances were truly dwarfed. On the stage and in society, demons and monsters, murders and obscenities, and colonial culture tainted the motherland's brilliant opera culture.

Our lives were not guaranteed, and our art was not guaranteed—this is an account, an old account of more than 20 years of Kuomintang reactionary rule.

Let's Settle Another Account

Each of us, together with the working people, turned over as a result of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution led by the Party. From the most basic levels of people's power in streets, villages, and towns to the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, there are representatives from the opera circles. We are no longer "actors" who are discriminated against. We are participants in the political power, masters of the country, and we are literary and art workers who have been educated by the Communist Party to have Marxist-Leninist ideological awareness and noble character.

The Party pointed out the direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We personally saw the noble qualities of the working people in performances for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which educated and transformed many actors, including ourselves. The Party and Chairman Mao first proposed the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" for opera work. This policy has made opera art flourish by leaps and bounds, and the opera stage has presented a scene of colorful flowers.

The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" has given youth to the ancient opera art. The establishment of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater not long ago fully illustrates this point. Kunqu Opera was already on its last breath after liberation. The Party and Chairman Mao were very concerned about its development. After the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Chairman Mao talked with the comrades of the Kunsu Opera Troupe for an hour or two. Last year, Shanghai held the North-South Kunqu Opera Joint Performance, and recently, the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater was established. Without the Party, could Kunqu Opera, which began to decline at the end of the Qing Dynasty, be revitalized? Recently, someone watched Mr. Mei Lanfang's play and said that his art is still developing. This is indeed the case. Our art has undergone new development after liberation. The saying "Old trees sprout new branches" can be applied to many ancient operas and many famous old artists. Comrade Chen Bohua, a Han opera actress, silently retired for seventeen years in the old society. After liberation, she restarted her artistic life. There are many similar examples. Isn't this the glory of the Party warming the hearts of these devastated opera actors! Hasn't Comrade Chen Shufang sitting here achieved new achievements in art after liberation! Didn't the old Sichuan opera artists say, "In the past, we learned with tears, but today we teach with joy!" Isn't Comrade Lang Xianfen sitting here an actress who has grown up after liberation! Isn't Luju opera a type of opera that has grown after liberation!

Chinese opera has not only become an art loved by audiences in China, but it has also been competing in the world's art scene, from Moscow to Santiago, from Paris to Hanoi, from London to Cairo, from Berlin to New Zealand, from Belgrade to Tokyo... Chinese opera actors have traveled all over the five continents. The French "L'Humanité" said "Paris cheers for Beijing." Can we say that the cheers of the people of the world for Chinese opera are not the victory of "Let a hundred flowers bloom!" Isn't it the admiration of the people of all countries for the wisdom and genius of the Chinese people and for the socialist victory of the great Chinese people!

Not only has the ancient opera gained youthful vitality, but many submerged operas and plays have been continuously discovered, and new operas and new actors have grown up in "Let a hundred flowers bloom." In the 1952 National Opera Performance, the statistics of opera types were more than 100, in 1955 it was more than 200, and the latest statistics are already 311. Almost forgotten and lost traditional plays have been excavated more than 55,000 to date. Shanghai alone has more than 10,000, and the eight operas in Shanghai have excavated more than 7,000 traditional plays. Hasn't the cultural life of the working people been greatly enriched! Hasn't opera art continued to prosper! Isn't this a great achievement in the past year! Recently, the Ministry of Culture accepted the opinions of the opera circles when implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and opened up more than 20 banned plays from the early days of liberation, once again demonstrating the Party and the government's full trust in opera actors. At present, there is a very gratifying scene of prosperity on the stage. Of course, some bad things have also been "released." As actors who are "engineers of the soul," we should pay attention to our social and moral responsibilities. We should not perform some plays that are irresponsible to society and fail to live up to the trust of the Party and the people in us!

As everyone knows, the State Council issued instructions last year to exempt entertainment tax for two years and reduce entertainment tax. Last year, it allocated 5 million yuan to help impoverished artists. Just when the country was carrying out large-scale economic construction, the country exempted and reduced taxes and allocated funds to support the opera cause and improve the lives of artists. Which ruling class in history has ever cared for artists like this? This is the first time in Chinese history. This is the Party and the government's deepest care for the opera circles. When the funds for helping artists were allocated to Shanghai, the artists were sincerely moved to tears, cheering for the Party's wisdom and grateful for the Party's care. What would we become without the Chinese Communist Party? Opera actors know this best.

The Party's leadership has brought prosperity to the opera cause and happiness to opera actors. The Party is leading us to complete a cause that our predecessors could not have done! This is another account, a new account of the Communist Party's leadership over the past eight years.

Comparing the two accounts, people with conscience can easily draw a fair conclusion. Of course, new causes cannot be without any shortcomings. Helping the Party in rectification is completely different from "carrying" the "sedan chair" for anti-communist and anti-socialist elements.

There are Shortcomings

In recent years, there have been some shortcomings and problems waiting to be solved in the drama work. In our drama team, one is a folk professional troupe operated by the artists themselves, and the other is a national troupe directly operated by the state. How should we treat these two brotherly teams that also serve socialism and the people? Some people mistakenly believe that folk professional troupes operated by the artists themselves, like private industrial and commercial enterprises, belong to the category of capitalist economy. Therefore, in the socialist transformation in 1956, all folk professional troupes were "transformed" into "state-owned." This is the case in Shanghai. Thus, there are "new state-owned" troupes and "old state-owned" troupes.

The comrades of the "new state-owned" troupes in Shanghai are right. This is just "wearing a state-owned hat." The cultural authorities still have little actual leadership as before. Of course, there are also shortcomings in the leadership of the "old state-owned" troupes. The main reason is that the cultural authorities are not good at leading the opera troupes according to their special laws, especially using the methods of the organs and groups and rigidly moving them into the work of the troupes, making the troupes institutionalized, with various sections and offices, bloated personnel, and working hours. The cultural authorities did not arrange performance tasks according to the characteristics of the opera types, the principles of the troupes, and the objective reality, but arranged them more according to the financial department's differences, which affected the normal development of artistic creation activities and would inevitably manage certain things too much, too rigidly, and too specifically. There are differences between new and old state-owned troupes in the drama team, and there are various types among the new and old. The cultural authorities did not study this complex situation well, and made specific arrangements according to different situations, different levels, and objective needs, but generally treated them in the same way, which obviously cannot promote the artistic progress of different opera types and different troupes, but instead promotes the idea of absolute egalitarianism among some comrades.

We believe that the work of the Central Ministry of Culture has shortcomings, and the Ministry of Culture's supervision of local cultural departments is not enough. We also know that the local cultural departments lead many undertakings and have limited strength. The Ministry of Culture does not go deep into the grassroots level, understand the reality, listen to the opinions of all parties, especially the artists, and solve problems in a timely manner in important work links, which makes it impossible to solve the problems and shortcomings in the grassroots work at any time.

Shortcomings Can Be Corrected

In the past few years, the national troupes have completed the tasks given by the state, and many performances have played a demonstrative role. We do not agree with the view that "national troupes have made mistakes and should be abolished." This kind of left-leaning and right-leaning approach will bring losses to the drama cause. We fully agree with Premier Zhou's point in the government work report that "the state can only centrally run a few exemplary literary and sports undertakings and guide them towards self-sufficiency. For a large number of various cultural and art undertakings, we should advocate that cultural and art workers operate independently. Experience has proved that the idea and method of completely taking over by the state in the past is not appropriate. More importantly, we should widely carry out amateur literary and sports activities among the broad masses of people. The teams of state-run, self-operated, and mass amateur literary and sports activities should learn from each other and improve through practice to gradually meet the people's needs for cultural life." The phenomenon of troupe institutionalization should be eliminated. Economically, the national troupes should gradually become self-sufficient on the premise of ensuring artistic quality, and should not be taken over by the state and become a burden on the state. Artistically, the demonstration should not be separated from the reality of the entire opera circle. Folk professional troupes and national troupes are both serving the people. The cultural authorities should strengthen the leadership of national troupes and also strengthen the leadership of folk professional troupes. Do not just wear a hat without leadership. The Ministry of Culture and the cultural authorities in various places will be able to lead the drama work to a more prosperous road in the future if they better arrange their work and rely more closely on the masses.

"Distance Tests a Horse's Strength"

There is an old Chinese saying that "Distance tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart." For the Chinese Communist Party, it has only been eight years since liberation. This is not a long time, but opera actors have long seen the Party's wisdom and greatness. For the rightists, eight years is not a short time. The people have seen the Party's greatness, but the rightist gentlemen are still clamoring for "Party world," "Please the Communist Party to step down," "Kill Communists," "The Party cannot lead science and culture." Will the people agree? The people have launched a struggle against the rightists and to defend socialism. It is still time to rein in at the precipice. Please do not cut yourselves off from the people, rightist gentlemen.

Here we want to raise a special issue, that is, since last autumn, the rightists have carried out a series of organized anti-communist and anti-socialist activities in the opera circles through the democratic parties such as the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. This activity reached its climax after April this year. In Shanghai, Shen Zhiyuan, Chen Renbing, Lu Yi and others used the opportunity of airing their views to massively develop organizations in the opera circles on the one hand, and on the other hand, they set fires everywhere to carry out anti-Party and anti-government activities. In Beijing, as the newspapers have already revealed, the person in charge of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party used ugly methods such as picking up and dropping off cars, banquets, and promising official positions to develop organizations and spread anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks in the opera circles. This conspiracy has begun to be exposed and will continue to be thoroughly exposed. However, we believe that the more worthy of our vigilance is the question of why these rightists chose the opera circles as the target of their massive development of organizations? The matter is very clear. This is because for a long time, our political and ideological work in the opera circles has been very poor, and there are still serious liberalism and residual sectarianism among opera artists and cadres, especially a lack of understanding of the basic nature of ideological remolding. Until today, we have not completely transformed from one class to another. Therefore, the rightists use our political naivety to confuse the public and win people's hearts. Now, at the time of opposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the rightists, we deeply feel that this complex struggle is a test and exercise for opera actors. We must invest ourselves in this battle to temper ourselves and test ourselves, so that we can improve our ideological understanding of Marxism-Leninism in this battle, learn to distinguish right from wrong, analyze things, and distinguish between true Marxism and false Marxism, and distinguish between true revolution and false revolution from Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and this political struggle. We know that anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists are ultimately in the minority among the people, but among intellectuals and literary and art workers, due to our background, experience, and exposure to capitalist ideological education, right-leaning thoughts are more or less common among us. Then, we should transform ourselves, improve ourselves, overcome our individualism, and criticize our right-leaning sentiments in this struggle.

Li Yu, a dramatist in the Qing Dynasty, said that when he talked about his ideals, he hoped that opera actors would "change their singing from mouth to heart" and "transform singers into literati." The ideals that our predecessors were unable to realize for more than two hundred years have been realized by opera actors in New China in the eight years of the Party's leadership! How should we calculate this account? We will teach it to you rightist gentlemen.

### 戏曲演员要在反右派斗争中锻炼自己，考验自己  周信芳、袁雪芬的联合发言

    戏曲演员要在反右派斗争中锻炼自己，考验自己
    周信芳、袁雪芬的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，这篇讲演，是我们在社会主义建设的斗争中，最准确的指南针。我们同意周总理在这次会议上所作的政府工作报告和政府负责同志的各项报告，这些报告有力地驳斥了右派分子的反党言论，说明了党所领导的社会主义事业的飞跃进步和巨大成就。
    我们戏曲界的同志，面对着右派分子颠倒黑白的恶言恶行，我们义不容辞要说几句话。
    先算一笔账
    右派先生们要和党“算旧账”。非常“感谢”他们，这一句话不禁使我们触起了对以往沉痛岁月的回忆，想起了八年来党给我们戏曲界带来的深恩厚义。抚今忆昔，有正义良心的人，可以清楚地算出这笔“账”。
    我们每个人在旧社会饱受了压迫、剥削、侮辱的苦难，想讲的话不能讲，想演的戏不能演。就拿我们两个人来说，京剧“徽钦二帝”被日本特务勾结“工部局”下令禁演，越剧“山河恋”的演出遭到反动派的“勒令停演”和种种迫害；国民党警备司令部传讯周信芳是因为他接近进步艺人，袁雪芬没有屈从国民党的要挟去演“戡乱”戏而被特务流氓抛粪。我们不过是千百个被侮辱被迫害的两个罢了。
    艺术又怎样呢？在反动派统治下，戏曲艺术在衰退，真正的好戏、好的表演艺术和流行的黄色戏曲、色情表演比较之下，真是相形见拙。舞台上和社会上一样，牛鬼蛇神、凶杀淫猥，殖民地文化玷污了祖国灿烂的戏曲文化。
    我们的生活没有保障，我们的艺术也没有保障——这是一笔账，一笔国民党反动派统治了二十多年的旧账。
    再算一笔账
    我们每个人和劳动人民一起，随着党所领导的中国人民革命的胜利而翻了身。从人民政权的最基层的街道、村镇直到全国人民代表大会，以及全国政协，都有戏曲界的代表，我们不再是受人歧视的“戏子”，我们是政权的参予者、国家的主人，我们是共产党教养我们成为具有马列主义思想觉悟和高尚品德的文艺工作者。
    党给我们指出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，我们亲身在为工农兵演出中看到了劳动人民的崇高品质，使许多演员、包括我们自己在内得到了教育和改造。党和毛主席给戏曲工作首先提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针。这个方针，使戏曲艺术一日千里地欣欣向荣，使戏曲舞台上呈现了万紫千红的景象。
    “百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，使古老的戏曲艺术获得了青春。前不久，北方昆曲剧院的成立充分说明了这一点。昆曲在解放后已经是奄奄一息了，党和毛主席很关心它的发展，“十五贯”演出后，毛主席和昆苏剧团同志详谈了一两个小时，去年上海南北昆曲会演，直到最近成立北方昆曲剧院，没有党，从清末就开始衰落的昆曲能振兴吗？最近，有人看了梅兰芳先生的戏，说他的艺术还在发展，确是这样，我们大家的艺术在解放后有了新的发展。“老树发新枝”这句话，既能加在许多古老剧种的身上，又可以加在许多成名的老艺人身上。汉剧演员陈伯华同志，在旧社会无声无臭地息影了十七年，解放后重新开始了她的艺术生活。同样的例子还有很多，这难道不是党的光辉温暖了这些被摧残了的戏曲演员的心吗！在座的陈书舫同志不是解放后在艺术上取得了新的成就吗！川剧老艺人不是说“过去是哭哭啼啼学了来，今天是欢欢喜喜教出来”吗！在座的郎咸芬同志不是解放后成长起来的演员吗！吕剧不是解放后壮大起来的剧种吗！
    中国戏曲不仅在国内成为观众所热爱的艺术，而且它已经在世界艺术的花坛里争妍斗艳，从莫斯科到圣地亚哥，从巴黎到河内，从伦敦到开罗，从柏林到新西兰，从贝尔格莱德到东京……，中国戏曲演员走遍了五大洲。法国“人道报”说“巴黎欢呼北京”，我们能说世界人民对中国戏曲的欢呼不是“百花齐放”的胜利吗！不是各国人民对中国人民的智慧和天才、对伟大中国人民的社会主义胜利的敬羡吗！
    不单古老的戏曲剧种获得了青春的活力，而且许多被淹没的剧种、剧目不断被发掘出来，新的剧种、新的演员在“百花齐放”中成长起来。一九五二年全国戏曲会演，戏曲剧种的统计是一百余种，一九五五年是二百余种，最近的统计已经是三百一十一种了。几乎被遗忘丢失的传统剧目，到现在为止已经挖掘了五万五千余出，上海的就有一万余出，单是上海八个剧种就挖掘了七千多出传统剧目。劳动人民的文化生活不是大大丰富了吗！戏曲艺术不是不断的繁荣了吗！这难道不是一年以来的巨大成绩吗！最近文化部在贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针时接受了戏曲界的意见，开放了解放初期的二十几出禁戏，再一次说明了党和政府对戏曲演员的充分信任。目前舞台上出现了非常可喜的繁荣景象，当然，也“放”了一些不好的东西，作为“灵魂工程师”的演员，应该注意自己的社会责任和道德责任，我们不应当演一些对社会不负责任的戏，辜负党和人民对我们的信任！
    大家都知道，国务院去年颁布了免征娱乐税两年和减征娱乐税的指示，去年又拨款五百万元救济贫苦艺人，正当国家大规模进行经济建设的时候，国家免税减税、拨款来扶植戏曲事业、改善艺人生活，历史上那一个统治阶级这样关怀过艺人？这是中国历史上第一次，这是党和政府对戏曲界最深切的关爱。当救济艺人款项拨到上海的时候，艺人们由衷地感动得热泪夺眶而出，欢呼党的英明，感激党的关怀。我们离开了中国共产党会变成什么样子，戏曲演员是最清楚的了。
    党的领导，带给戏曲事业繁荣，带给戏曲演员幸福，党领导我们在完成前人不可能做的事业！——这又是一笔账，一笔共产党领导八年来的新账。
    两笔账对比一下，有良心的人不难得出公正的结论。当然，新的事业不可能一点缺点也没有。帮助党整风，和“抬”反共反社会主义的“轿子”完全是两回事。
    缺点是有的
    近年来，戏剧工作是存在一些缺点和等待解决的问题的。在我们戏剧队伍里，一种是艺人自己经营的民间职业剧团，一种是国家直接经营的国家剧团。应该怎样对待这两支同样是为社会主义服务、为人民服务的兄弟联队呢？有人误以为艺人自己经营的民间职业剧团同私人工商业一样，是属于资本主义经济范畴的，于是在一九五六年社会主义改造中，把所有民间职业剧团都“改造”成为“国营”。上海就是如此。于是出现了“新国营”剧团和“老国营”剧团之分。
    上海的“新国营”剧团的同志们说得对，这只是“戴了一顶国营帽子”，文化主管部门仍然像以往那样，很少有实际的领导。当然，对“老国营”剧团的领导也是存在缺点的，主要是文化主管部门还不善于根据戏曲团体的特殊规律来进行领导，特别是用机关团体的办法硬搬到剧团工作中来，使剧团机关化，各科各室，人员臃肿，上班下班；文化主管部门并没有根据剧种的特点、剧团的方针、客观的实际来安排演出任务，而是更多地根据财政部门的差额来安排，这就影响了艺术创造活动的正常开展，必然会对某些事管得太多、太呆板、太具体。戏剧队伍里有新老国营之分，新老之中又有各种各样类型，文化主管部门并没有很好地研究这种复杂情况，根据不同情况、不同水平、客观需要加以具体安排，而是一般化的千篇一律的“平均”对待，这显然不能很好地推动不同剧种、不同剧团在艺术上的进步，反而助长了某些同志的绝对平均主义思想。
    我们认为，中央文化部的工作是有缺点的，文化部对各地文化部门督促不够。我们也知道，各地文化部门所领导的事业多，力量又有限，文化部不在重要的工作环节上深入下层，了解实际，听取各方面、特别是艺人群众的意见，及时解决问题，这就使下层工作中的问题和缺点，不能随时得到解决。
    缺点是能改正的
    几年来，国家剧团完成了国家给予的任务，有许多演出是起了示范作用的。我们不同意“国家剧团搞错了、取消国家剧团”的看法，这种忽左忽右的作法，是会给戏剧事业带来损失的。我们完全同意周总理在政府工作报告中指出的“国家只能集中地举办少数的示范性的文艺和体育事业，并且引导他们走向自给。对于大量的各种文化艺术事业，应该提倡文化艺术工作者自力经营。经验证明，过去完全由国家包下来的想法和办法是不妥当的。更重要的是在广大群众中广泛地开展业余的文艺和体育活动。国家举办、自力经营、群众业余这三个方面的文艺和体育活动队伍，应该通过实践相互学习和提高，以逐步满足人民对于文化生活的需要。”应该消除剧团机关化的现象，经济上国家剧团在保证艺术质量的前提下要逐步自给自足，不应该让国家包下来成为国家的包袱；在艺术上的示范，应该不脱离整个戏曲界的实际。民间职业剧团和国家剧团同样是为人民服务，文化主管部门应该加强对国家剧团的领导，也应该加强对民间职业剧团的领导，不要只戴帽子而没有领导。文化部和各地的文化主管部门今后更好地安排工作，更紧密地依靠群众是完全能够把戏剧工作引向更繁盛的道路。
    “路遥知马力”
    中国有句老话叫“路遥知马力，日久见人心”，这句话对中国共产党来说，解放才八年，这是一个不长的时间，可是戏曲演员早已经看出了党的英明伟大；这句话对右派分子说，八年又是一个不短的时间，人民已经看出了党的伟大，可是右派先生们还在叫嚣“党天下”“请共产党下台”“杀共产党人”“党不能领导科学文化”这些疯言狂语，人民答应不答应？人民已经展开了反右派、保卫社会主义的斗争，悬崖勒马还是时机，请右派先生们不要自绝于人民。
    在这里我们要特别提出一个问题，就是从去秋以来，右派分子通过民盟、农工民主党等民主党派，对戏曲界进行了一系列反共反社会主义的有组织活动，这种活动在今年4月以后，达到高潮，在上海，沈志远、陈仁炳、陆诒等人利用鸣放机会，一面大量在戏曲界发展组织，另一方面是四处点火，进行反党反政府的活动，在北京，正如报上已经揭发的一样，农工民主党负责人用汽车接送、宴会，封官许愿等丑恶办法，在戏曲界发展组织和散布反党反社会主义的言论。这种阴谋已经开始揭露，并将继续地彻底揭露，但是，我们以为更值得我们警惕的问题是为什么这些右派分子选择了戏曲界作为他们大量发展组织的对象？事情很明白的。这就是因为长期以来，我们戏曲界的政治思想工作做得很差，戏曲艺人和干部还存在着严重的自由主义和残余的宗派主义情绪，特别是对思想改造这一带有基本性质的问题认识不足，直到今天还没有彻底地从一个阶级转变到另一个阶级。所以右派分子利用我们 政治上的幼稚，来混淆视听，笼络人心。如今在反对右派分子的反党反社会主义言行的时际，我们深切感到这场复杂的斗争，对戏曲演员来说是一场考验和锻炼，我们一定要投入这场战斗，来锻炼自己、考验自己，使自己在这场战斗里提高马克思列宁主义的思想认识，从毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和这场政治斗争中，学会辨别是非、分析事物，分清真马克思主义和假马克思主义，分清真革命和假革命。我们知道，在人们中间反党反社会主义的右派分子到底是极少数，但是在知识分子和文艺工作者中间，由于我们的出身、经历，以及受到资本主义的思想教育，右倾思想在我们这些人中间或多或少是普遍存在的，那么，我们就应该在这场斗争里，改造自己，提高自己，克服自己身上的个人主义思想，批判自己思想上的右倾情绪。
    清代戏剧家李渔说到他的理想时，他希望戏曲演员“变口唱为心唱”“化歌者为文人”。前人两百多年来没有能够实现的理想，可是在党领导的八年中，新中国的戏曲演员实现了！这笔账如何算呢？我们就教于右派的诸位先生们。
