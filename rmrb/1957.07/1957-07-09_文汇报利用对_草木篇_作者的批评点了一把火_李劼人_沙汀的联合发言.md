*Wenhui Bao* Uses Criticism of "Grass and Trees" Author to Fan the Flames
Li Jieren and Sha Ting's Joint Statement

We are prepared to talk to the conference about the "Grass and Trees" issue.

"Grass and Trees" is a set of prose poems using objects to express emotions written by Liu Shahe (original name Yu Xuntan, currently 25 years old), a cadre of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and a member of the Communist Youth League. After this set of poems was published, it caused heated debate in Sichuan's literary and art circles. Most articles sharply exposed the serious errors in the ideological content of the work, believing that it spread dissatisfaction and hostile emotions towards the real society, and promoted an individualistic ideology that despised the masses and was aloof and arrogant. Therefore, in essence, it is an anti-socialist bad work.

It should be affirmed that it was completely correct and necessary for Sichuan's literary and art circles to launch a criticism of such a work. Among them, many articles were reasoned and made convincing analyses of the work. A few articles used relatively simple or crude methods of criticism. However, the author, Liu Shahe, insisted that this was an organized "encirclement and suppression," and we cannot agree with this statement. As far as we know, most of the articles published in newspapers and periodicals were contributions from the masses. The masses felt that there were poisonous ideas in "Grass and Trees," and they were unwilling to remain silent and actively participated in this debate, isn't this very natural? We believe that if the masses did not actively participate in this debate and allowed the poisonous weeds to spread, that would be an abnormal thing.

From the objective effect, this criticism was also good, as it greatly reduced the market for the erroneous ideas spread by "Grass and Trees." Professor Liu Junhui of Sichuan Normal College cited an example, saying that some students initially appreciated "Grass and Trees," but after reading the critical articles, they all said their eyes were opened. Although Liu Shahe's speech at the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' theoretical criticism group discussion on February 12 still lacked a deep understanding of the errors in his work and his thinking had not truly resolved the problem, he had already expressed agreement with some of the opinions in the criticism, and he was no longer shouting and scolding as he did at the beginning of the criticism, that is to say, his attitude began to show a preliminary improvement.

*Wenhui Bao*'s reporter's visit to Liu Shahe suddenly made Liu Shahe's attitude worse

However, the development of the matter later changed again, that is, when a few right-wing elements of the Sichuan Democratic League took the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work in early May and set fires everywhere, especially after the *Wenhui Bao* reporter visited Liu Shahe, Liu Shahe's attitude suddenly became worse. In his conversation with the *Wenhui Bao* reporter, he deliberately confused the criticism of "Grass and Trees," which involved issues of literary and artistic policy, with the criticism of his certain violations of the Communist Youth League's organizational principles and serious erroneous ideological words and deeds by the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Youth League organization, fabricated facts, saying that he wrote "Grass and Trees" and was not only criticized in newspapers and periodicals, but also subjected to "repression" within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' organization, "repressed" to the point where "even the freedom of communication guaranteed by the Constitution was hindered," and "his actions were noticed by certain people." In a word, he lost his freedom of communication and personal freedom! Zhang Mosheng, a member of the Democratic League who had direct contact with Pan Dakui, a core member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, immediately expressed his full support for Liu Shahe's speech and completely negated the criticism of "Grass and Trees."

However, all nonsense cannot stand refutation. Regarding the so-called "political persecution" issue, Li Lei, the director of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Creation Department and secretary of the Party branch, has already exposed Liu Shahe's lies with verified facts. Liu Shahe himself later told the leading comrades of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles that he basically agreed with what Li Lei said about him. Here we only want to talk about why the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Youth League organization criticized Liu Shahe, which may help everyone understand his character and the ideological background of his writing "Grass and Trees." Within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' organization, Liu Shahe has always expressed dissatisfaction with the Party's various policies. Especially after the Hungarian incident broke out last year, his dissatisfaction became more blatant. At the Youth League group meetings, he openly attacked the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals, saying that he was "ashamed of the weakness of Chinese intellectuals"; he also did not think much of the anti-revolutionary policy, saying that "half of it is class struggle, and half of it is a joke"! He believed that our country's system was not democratic at all, and openly declared: "I really want to go to a capitalist country to live a poor but free life."

Why is Liu Shahe so dissatisfied with the real society and exhibits so many erroneous ideological words and deeds? This is by no means accidental. Liu Shahe started working at the end of 1950, but according to recent materials from farmers in his hometown of Jintang County, Sichuan Daily, his father was accused by farmers of causing excessive public outrage, and was suppressed according to law during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951. This may be the fundamental reason why he is dissatisfied with the real society! But he is also a member of the Communist Youth League, and from the perspective of the Youth League's organizational principles, the Youth League has the responsibility and obligation to help and educate him to make progress. Therefore, as many fair-minded writers pointed out during the discussion of the Liu Shahe issue, the shortcomings in the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' organizational work are mainly that for such a young cadre, especially a comrade with hatred and errors in his thinking, it is even more necessary to conduct meticulous and principled class education; however, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' leadership only saw the superficial aspect of his cleverness, and blindly accommodated and took care of him. For example, the decision to nominate Liu Shahe to participate in the National Youth Writers' Representative Conference in 1956 was made by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Party organization against the opposition of some cadres. And the facts have proved that excessive care not only did not help him change his ideological stance and satisfy his demands, but also further increased his dissatisfaction with the Youth League's organizational life and the real social system. Regarding this issue, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Party organization has publicly stated that it will conduct a serious examination during this rectification.

*Wenhui Bao* reporter greatly exaggerated the slander of so-called "political persecution"

Finally, we would like to talk about the *Wenhui Bao*'s publication of that inflammatory report: "Liu Shahe Talks About 'Grass and Trees.'" This report was written by Fan Yan, the *Wenhui Bao*'s reporter stationed in Sichuan, on the eve of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' meeting in mid-May to discuss the merits and demerits of the criticism of "Grass and Trees." After Liu Shahe made a speech at the symposium on May 17 that was largely consistent with the content of the report, reporter Fan Yan of the newspaper sent another special dispatch similar to a daily record, reporting Liu Shahe's mood after his great airing of views. This shows how much attention *Wenhui Bao* paid to "Grass and Trees" and its author. But what is most infuriating is that since Liu Shahe raised the so-called "political persecution" issue in his conversation, the *Wenhui Bao* reporter not only did not verify the facts at all, but also deliberately exaggerated Liu Shahe's emotions of feeling suppressed and harmed, fearing that its deceptive and inflammatory nature was not great enough!

We believe that the approach of Fan Yan, the *Wenhui Bao*'s reporter stationed in Sichuan, is inseparable from the *Wenhui Bao*'s criminal activities in resolutely implementing the capitalist line of the Zhang-Luo anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist alliance and frantically attacking the proletariat in recent months. The *Wenhui Bao*'s assessment of the "airing of views" in Sichuan has always been that "the spring chill has not gone away" and "there is no sign of thawing." Since it believes that there is no "thawing," it must be loyal to setting fires everywhere. Therefore, reporter Fan Yan of the newspaper clung to Liu Shahe as soon as he arrived in Chengdu, and as a result, wrote the report "Liu Shahe Talks About 'Grass and Trees.'" And this report, which distorts the facts and is full of malicious attacks, is exactly the fire that *Wenhui Bao* wants to set in Chengdu's literary and art circles!

*Wenhui Bao* says it wants to "examine shortcomings and correct mistakes," but then publishes reports that do not distinguish between right and wrong

Comrade Li Lei exposed Liu Shahe's lies at the symposium on June 13, and two or three other cadres of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles unanimously believed that Li Lei's speech was in accordance with the facts, and they all stated that they were close to Liu Shahe on weekdays, but how did *Wenhui Bao* reporter Fan Yan report this symposium? Regardless of the title or content, this report tried to give people the impression that Li Lei's speech was nothing more than a one-sided statement and should not be lightly believed! And what is most noteworthy is that the day before *Wenhui Bao* published this report, on June 14, it published an editorial, stating that it would "examine shortcomings and correct mistakes," and that it was deeply convinced that it "could withstand the test." But only one day later, this report really "tested" *Wenhui Bao*!

From this, it can be seen that to truly "clarify the direction" and turn around from the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist track, it is impossible to do so with a mere feint. But the facts are already clear: the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Party organization and Li Lei did not carry out the so-called "political persecution" of Liu Shahe, but the *Wenhui Bao*'s report, which distorts the facts and is inflammatory, constitutes a political persecution of Li Lei and a political slander of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Party organization! Because after this report was published, it once caused ordinary people inside and outside Sichuan Province who were unaware of the truth to demand the dismissal and investigation of Li Lei, and even demand that Li Lei be sent to judicial organs for handling.

Recently, through constant criticism and exposure from all sides, *Wenhui Bao* has paid attention to this issue on July 3rd and 4th, and has made some explanations and some self-criticism. This is welcome, but it is far from enough. Because if it immediately tries to exonerate Fan Yan and disguise a person who directly carried out the task of setting fires as Liu Shahe's "prisoner," it will not be helpful to helping Fan Yan correct his mistakes; it will not be helpful to *Wenhui Bao* thoroughly eliminating its bourgeois ideas of running a newspaper; and it will not be helpful to Xu Zhucheng, the person in charge of *Wenhui Bao*, thoroughly drawing a line between himself and the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

We hope that *Wenhui Bao* can have a better explanation and a better self-criticism.

### 文汇报利用对“草木篇”作者的批评点了一把火  李劼人　沙汀的联合发言

    文汇报利用对“草木篇”作者的批评点了一把火
    李劼人　沙汀的联合发言
    我们准备向大会谈一谈有关“草木篇”的问题。
      “草木篇”是四川省文联一个干部，共青团员流沙河（原名余勋坦，现年二十五岁）写的一组托物抒情的散文诗。这组诗发表后，在四川文艺界引起了热烈的论争。大部分文章都尖锐地揭露了作品思想内容上的严重错误，认为它散布了对现实社会的不满和敌对情绪，宣扬了鄙视群众、孤高自大的个人主义。因而按其实质，它是一篇反社会主义的坏作品。
    应当肯定，四川文艺界对于这样一篇作品展开一次批评，是完全正确的、必要的。其中，不少文章是说理的，对作品进行了令人信服的分析。也有少数文章的批评方法是比较简单或粗暴的。可是作者流沙河却硬说这是一次有组织的“围剿”，我们不能同意这种说法。据我们了解，报刊上发表的大部分文章都是群众的来稿。群众感觉到了“草木篇”中存在着有毒的思想，不愿默不作声，积极的参加了这场论争，这不是很自然吗？我们认为，如果群众不积极参加这一论争，听任毒草蔓延，那倒是一件反常的事情。
    这一次的批评，从客观效果说，也是好的，它大大缩小了“草木篇”所散布的错误思想的市场。四川师范学院刘君惠教授曾举例说，有些学生，开始很欣赏“草木篇”，看了批评文章以后，都说眼睛亮了。作者流沙河在2月12日四川省文联理论批评组座谈会上的发言，虽然对作品的错误仍缺乏深刻的认识，思想上并未真正解决问题，但是他已表示同意批评中的一部分意见，而且不再像批评开始时那样叫嚣和谩骂了，即是说他的态度开始有了初步的好转。
    文汇报记者访问流沙河以后，流沙河的态度忽然变得更坏了
    但是事情的发展后来又发生变化，那就是当5月初旬，四川民盟少数右派分子借口帮助党整风，到处点火的时候，特别是文汇报记者访问流沙河以后，流沙河的态度忽然变得更加坏了。他在对文汇报记者的谈话时，有意混淆了报刊上对“草木篇”这一带文艺方针性质的批评，和四川省文联团组织对他某些违反团组织原则和严重错误思想言行的批评，捏造事实，说他写了“草木篇”，不仅在报刊上受到批评，还受到文联机关内部的“压制”，“压制”到“连宪法上所给予的通讯自由都受到了阻碍”，“行动受到了某些人的注意”。一句话，他失去了通讯自由和人身自由！而四川大学中文系主任，同章罗联盟的骨干分子潘大逵有着直接联系的民盟盟员张默生，立刻表示全力支持流沙河的发言，对“草木篇”的批评全部加以否定。
    但是，一切胡言乱语总是经不住驳斥的，关于所谓“政治陷害”的问题，四川省文联创作部长兼党支部书记李累同志，已经用经过查对的事实揭穿了流沙河的谎言。流沙河本人后来也向文联领导同志表示，李累所谈的有关他的情况，他基本上同意。这里我们只想谈一谈文联的团组织为甚么对流沙河进行批评，这对大家了解他的为人，他写作“草木篇”的思想背景，可能有些帮助。在文联机关内，流沙河一向就对党的各项方针政策表示不满。特别是去年匈牙利事件爆发后，他的不满更露骨了。在团小组会上，他公开攻击党对知识分子的思想改造政策，说他“为中国知识分子的软弱，感到耻辱”；对于肃反政策，他也不以为是，说“一半是阶级斗争，一半是开玩笑”！他认为我们国家的制度根本就不民主，并公开宣称：“我真愿意到资本主义国家去过一种贫困而自由的生活。”
    流沙河为什么会对现实社会如此不满，而且表现出许多错误的思想言行呢？这绝不是偶然的。流沙河于1950年底参加工作，但据最近四川日报来自他的家乡金堂县农民所揭露的材料，他的父亲因民愤过大被农民控告，于1951年镇反时，依法被镇压了。这或者就是他不满现实社会的根本原因吧！但他又是一个共青团员，从团的组织原则讲，团是有责任和义务帮助和教育他进步的。因此，正如在讨论流沙河问题时不少公正作家所指出的那样，省文联组织工作上的缺点，主要是对这样一个年轻干部，特别是思想上有了仇恨和错误的同志，更是需要细致而有原则的进行阶级教育的；而文联平日的领导，却只从表面看到他有些小聪明的一面，一味的迁就照顾。比如，1956年提名流沙河参加全国青年作者代表会议的决定，就是文联党组织在一部分干部的反对下作出的。而事实证明，过多的照顾不但没有帮助他改变思想立场，满足他的要求，反而更加助长了他对于团的组织生活和现实社会制度的不满。对此问题，文联党组织已经公开表示要在这次整风中认真进行检查。
    文汇报记者对所谓“政治陷害”的污蔑竟大加渲染
    最后，我们想谈一谈文汇报发表那篇煽动性的报导：“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”。这篇报导是在5月中旬文联开会讨论“草木篇”批评的是非问题的前夕，文汇报驻川记者范琰写的。5月17日流沙河在座谈会上作了与报导内容大体一致的发言后，该报记者范琰又拍发了一个类似起居注的专电，报导流沙河大鸣大放后的心情。由此可见，文汇报对“草木篇”及其作者给予了多么大的注意。但最令人愤慨的，流沙河在谈话中既然提出了所谓“政治陷害”问题，文汇报记者不仅不对事实进行任何查对，还故意把流沙河自以为受了压抑、受了损害的情绪渲染了一通，惟恐它的欺骗性煽动性不够大！
    我们认为文汇报驻四川记者范琰的这种作法，是同文汇报几个月来坚决执行章罗反共、反人民、反社会主义的资本主义路线，猖狂向无产阶级进攻这一罪恶活动分不开的。文汇报对四川“鸣”“放”的估计一直是“春寒未去”，“毫无解冻之意”。既是认为没有“解冻”，当然就要衷于到处点火了。因而该报记者范琰一到成都就缠住流沙河不放，结果写出了那篇“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”的报导。而这篇歪曲事实，充满恶意攻击的报导，正是文汇报想在成都文艺界点一把火！
    文汇报说要“检查缺点，改正错误”，但随着又刊登出不辨明是非的报道
    李累同志在6月13日的座谈会上揭露了流沙河的诳言，文联其他两三个干部一致认为李累的发言符合事实，而且他们都说明自己平日同流沙河是接近的，可是文汇报记者范琰是怎样报导这个座谈的呢？不管标题、内容，这篇报导都力图给人这样一种印象：李累的发言无非一面之辞，不可轻信！而最值得注意的是，文汇报发表这篇报导的前一天，在6月14日发表了社论，表示要“检查缺点，改正错误”，而且深信自己“经得起考验”。但是事隔一天，这篇报导真的就“考验”了“文汇报”！
    由此可见，要真正“明确方向”，从反党、反人民、反社会主义的轨道上扭转来，绝非虚晃一枪办得到的。但是事实早已明明白白，四川省文联党组织和李累并没有对流沙河进行所谓“政治陷害”，而文汇报那篇歪曲事实，带有煽动性的报导，却构成了对李累的政治陷害和对四川省文联党组织的政治诬蔑！因为这篇报导发表以后，曾经引起四川省内外一般不明真相的人，要求撤职查办李累，甚至要求将李累送司法机关处理。
    最近，经各方面不断的批评、揭发，文汇报在7月3日、4日，已经重视这一问题，并有所交代，有所检查。这是值得欢迎的，但还很不够。因为如果一来就为范琰开脱，把一个直接执行放火任务的人化装成流沙河的“俘虏”，这对帮助范琰改正错误没有好处；对文汇报彻底清除其资产阶级办报思想没有好处；对文汇报的负责人徐铸成彻底同章罗联盟划清界限，更是没有好处。
    我们希望文汇报能有更好的交代，更好的检查。
