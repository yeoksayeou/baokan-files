The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League Should No Longer Be Weak and Ineffective; The Struggle Against Wang Dachuan Should Be Strengthened

    (Our Dispatch) Since late June, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and its affiliated organizations have successively exposed Wang Dachuan, the agent of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Tianjin and a standing committee member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Wang Dachuan has been starting fires everywhere, instigating and organizing certain people with anti-Party sentiments to viciously attack the Communist Party.

    According to preliminary materials, after the rectification campaign began in May, rightist Wang Dachuan, through rightist Li Baozhen, whom he had placed as the deputy director of the China Democratic League branch at Nankai University, organized some people with anti-Party sentiments in the Economics Department of Nankai University to hold forums, where they railed, "Nankai University is under dark rule, and Communist Party members are poisonous snakes," and so on. Subsequently, Wang Dachuan promoted the "advanced experience" of the Nankai University China Democratic League branch in attacking the Party without the approval of the university Party committee to the China Democratic League branches at Tianjin University and Tianjin Normal College. Wang Dachuan repeatedly incited the Liaison Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League to organize the social figures it contacted to "speak out freely," and Wang Dachuan and his confidant Zheng Weishi also personally planned for the China Democratic League group of the Tianjin Civil Architecture Design Institute to launch a massive attack on the Party.

    At a cadre meeting of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Wang Dachuan raised some provocative and inflammatory questions for people to discuss. For example, he said, "Junliangcheng is a grain-producing area, and the granaries are piled high with grain, but the peasants have no grain to eat. What is going on?" When Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks were criticized, he asked, "Why does it give people the impression that the working class only transforms the bourgeoisie and not themselves?"

    Many members of the China Democratic League and the municipal committee of the League repeatedly asked Wang Dachuan to seriously confess his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions and to confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo Alliance. However, Wang Dachuan evaded the issue and did not provide a concrete account.

    Some members believe that the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League has been weak and ineffective in leading the anti-rightist struggle during the past period, and this is even more so in the struggle against the rightist Wang Dachuan. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League has held a series of meetings recently to conduct self-criticism and has decided to strengthen leadership and mobilize members throughout the city to continue to expose and criticize the remarks and actions of rightists.

    民盟天津市委不应再软弱无力了
    应该加强对王大川的斗争
    本报讯　6月下旬以来，民盟天津市委及其所属组织，陆续揭露了章罗联盟在天津的代理人、民盟天津市委常务委员王大川到处点火，煽动和组织某些有反党情绪的人恶毒地攻击共产党。
    据初步的材料揭露：5月间，整风开始后，右派分子王大川通过他安插在南开大学民盟支部担任副主任委员的右派分子李宝震，组织了南开大学经济系一些有反党情绪的人开座谈会，大骂“南开大学是黑暗统治，共产党员是毒蛇”等等。接着，王大川向天津大学和天津师范学院等处的民盟支部推广南开大学民盟支部不通过学校党委召开座谈会向党进攻的“先进经验”。王大川曾经一再煽动民盟天津市委联络委员会组织所联系的社会人士“大鸣大放”，王大川及其亲信郑纬世还亲自策划天津民用建筑设计院民盟小组大肆向党进攻。
    在民盟天津市委机关的干部会上，王大川提出一些带挑拨性和煽动性的问题，要人们讨论。例如他说：“军粮城是产粮区，粮仓中粮食堆集如山，而农民们却没有粮食吃，这是怎么回事？”在章乃器的反动言论受到批判时，他提出：“为什么会给人一种印象，认为工人阶级不改造自己只改造资产阶级？”
    民盟天津市委机关许多盟员和盟市委曾多次提出，要王大川认真交代他反党反社会主义的言论和行动，要他交代与章罗联盟的关系。但王大川躲躲闪闪，并没有作具体交代。
    有些盟员认为，民盟天津市委在过去这一段期间内，对反右派斗争的领导软弱无力，对右派分子王大川的斗争更是这样。民盟天津市委近日连续举行了一些会议作了检查，并决定加强领导，动员全市盟员继续揭露和批判右派分子的言论和行动。
