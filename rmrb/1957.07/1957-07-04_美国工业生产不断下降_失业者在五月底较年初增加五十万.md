Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch from TASS: American newspapers, in commenting on the American economic situation in the first half of this year, point out that American industry has experienced serious difficulties this year that have caused unease in the business community. The newspapers point out that American industrial production has been continuously declining since the beginning of this year. According to statistics from the Federal Reserve System Authority, the industrial production index in December of last year was 147 (with the 1947-1949 level as 100), while the index for May has already dropped to 143.

The decline in production is particularly significant in heavy industry. From December of last year to May of this year, the non-ferrous metal production index fell from 146 to 134; metal products fell from 141 to 135; machinery and equipment fell from 176 to 169; and transportation equipment fell from 223 to 213.

Steel production has fallen sharply. In December of last year, the operating rate of the steel industry was 99.9%, while in the second half of June this year it was 85%.

Contrary to optimistic forecasts, the automotive industry encountered many difficulties in the first half of the year. Automobile companies are constantly reducing production and laying off workers. According to the "Commercial Daily," automobile production will be further reduced in early July.

Production in the machine tool manufacturing industry has also declined significantly. Machine tool orders in May of this year decreased by 52% compared to May 1956. This is the lowest level in the past two and a half years.

In the past six months, the real wages of American workers have been continuously decreasing. According to the Department of Labor, the weekly wages of American workers have decreased by almost 3% in six months, while the cost of living in the United States has increased by about 4% in the past year.

Due to the reduction in production in many industrial sectors, the phenomenon of laying off workers is becoming more and more common. The Department of Labor announced that the number of unemployed workers in the United States at the end of May increased by 500,000 compared to the beginning of this year.

    美国工业生产不断下降
    失业者在五月底较年初增加五十万
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：美国报刊在评论美国今年上半年的经济状况时指出，美国工业在今年发生了引起商界不安的严重困难。报纸指出，美国的工业生产今年一开始就不断下降。据联邦储备系统管理局统计，去年12月工业生产指数是一百四十七（1947—1949年的水平为一百），而5月份的指数已经下降到一百四十三。
    生产下降在重工业中特别显著。从去年12月到今年5月，有色金属生产指数由一百四十六降到一百三十四；金属制品由一百四十一降到一百三十五；机器设备由一百七十六降到一百六十九；交通设备由二百二十三降到二百一十三。
    钢的产量急骤下降。去年12月炼钢工业的开工率是99.9％，而今年6月下半月是85％。
    和乐观的预测相反，汽车工业在上半年中遭到了许多困难。汽车康采恩正在不断缩减生产和解雇工人。据“商务日报”报道，在7月初汽车生产还要进一步缩减。
    机床制造工业的生产也大大下降。今年5月份机床订货比1956年5月减少了52％。这是最近两年半以来最低的水平。
    在过去的半年中，美国劳动人民的实际工资不断降低。据劳工部宣布，美国工人的周薪在半年中几乎降低了3％，而在过去一年中，美国的生活费用大约增加了4％。
    由于许多工业部门缩减生产，解雇工人的现象越来越多了。劳工部公布，美国的失业工人在5月底比今年年初增加了五十万人。
