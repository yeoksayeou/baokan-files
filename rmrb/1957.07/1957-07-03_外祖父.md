Maternal Grandfather
Sun Wei Shi

I received a phone call early in the morning saying that my maternal grandfather's condition was serious, and I rushed to the hospital. On the way, my heart pounded, and the kind smile of the old man floated before my eyes: how he traveled from thousands of miles away to see us when my father sacrificed his life, how he took me to visit my mother's grave after she passed away... He was originally a successful candidate in the imperial examinations during the Qing dynasty; because he made revolution, the Qing government revoked his honor and ordered his arrest. He held an umbrella and jumped from the city wall, fleeing to another place. During the Kuomintang's rule, he did a lot of work for the Communist Party. Even in his seventies, he was arrested and imprisoned by the reactionaries. He had been through a lot in his life, experiencing many changes in personnel and enduring human suffering. After national liberation and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, he became younger and happier. Every time he came to Beijing for meetings, he would bring us dates and candies from his hometown. He actively participated in the local CPPCC's inspection work every year. Every time I saw him, I felt an indescribable sense of kinship and joy. He was eighty-nine years old this year. This time he was suffering from gastric bleeding turning into pneumonia. I understood the seriousness of this disease for him. When I walked into the hospital, I felt a chill in my heart, and my hands couldn't stop trembling. I put on a white coat and hurried upstairs, gently pushing open the door of the ward. The room was quiet, without a sound. The curtains were drawn, and the room was a bit dark. I walked to the bedside and called out "Grandpa!" Tears had hardened my throat. My maternal grandfather opened his eyes and said intermittently, "You're here, child! ... I'm fine..." He was much thinner, and his withered fingers pointed to a chair for me to sit down. I sat next to him, my heart filled with thousands of words, not knowing where to start. After a while, he spoke, his voice so soft that it was barely audible:

"I originally wanted to walk with you to socialism, but now I can't. I'm so old. I'm satisfied enough to see the new China..." He coughed, gasped for a moment, and then continued, "My funeral should be handled simply and frugally..." His eyes closed, and my tears welled up. Suddenly he opened his eyes and asked:

"How is the struggle against the right-wingers going?"

I held back my tears and quickly replied, "The fallacies of the right-wingers have aroused the anger of the people, and the struggle against them is now unfolding." His eyes shone brightly as he looked at me and said, "That's very good!" After a pause, he said, "We have shortcomings, and we must correct them. The Communist Party is carrying out rectification precisely to improve its work!" He slapped the bed with his hand and then said, "What nonsense! Without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the Party's leadership, would we have today? 'Kill the Communists...' 'Political Design Institute...' Ge Peiqi, Chu Anping, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji... What kind of people are they? What kind of hearts do they have? We can't just let these people with ulterior motives talk nonsense. The people should speak, the people should be allowed to speak!" Because of anger, his face flushed, and I quickly held his hand tightly. Yes, the people must speak, the people cannot remain silent any longer, they should rise up to defend the fruits of our revolution, they should defend our beloved Party! We must wage a resolute struggle against these right-wingers with ulterior motives! I held my maternal grandfather's hand, feeling the warmth of his hand, feeling the infinite vitality in him. He will live on! He will definitely live on!

    外祖父
    孙维世
    清晨得到电话，说外祖父的病情严重，我忙向医院赶去。一路上心中突突地直跳，老人慈祥的笑容浮在我的眼前：父亲牺牲时，他怎样从千里外赶来看我们，母亲去世后，他怎样带着我去上坟……他原是前清的举人；因为闹革命，被清朝政府革掉功名，下令通缉，他撑着一把雨伞从城墙上跳了下来亡命他乡。国民党统治时期，他替共产党作了许多工作，七十余岁的高龄还被反动派逮捕囚押。他一生奔波，经历了许多人事的变迁，饱受了人间的辛酸。全国解放后，中华人民共和国成立，他变得年轻愉快了，每次来北京开会时，他都给我们带些家乡的枣子和糖果，每年地方政协的视察工作，他都积极地参加。我每次见到他，心中都感到说不出的亲切和喜悦。他今年已经八十九岁了。这次害的病是胃出血转肺炎，我懂得这病对他的严重，走进病院时，我的心中有些发冷，手止不住地战栗起来。我换上了白色的外衣，匆匆地奔上楼去，轻轻地推开了病房的门，屋子里静悄悄地一点声音也没有，窗帘放了下来，屋子里有些暗，我走近床前，叫了一声“老爷！”泪水已把喉咙硬住了。外祖父睁开了眼睛，断断续续地说：“你来了，孩子！……我不要紧……”他瘦多了，枯槁的手指着椅子让我坐，我挨着他坐了下来，心中千言万语，不知从何说起。过了一会儿，他说话了，声音轻得仅仅刚能听见：
      “我原想和你们一起走到社会主义，现在不行了，年纪这么大，能看到新中国，我也够满意了……”他咳嗽起来，喘息了一会儿，接着说：“我的后事要办得精简节约……”他的眼睛闭上了，我的眼泪涌了出来，忽然他睁开了眼问道：
      “反右派分子的斗争进行得怎么样了？”
    我噙着眼泪，连忙回答说：“右派分子的谬论已经引起了人民的愤怒，现在正在展开和他们的斗争。”他的两眼炯炯有神地望着我说：“这样很好！”停了一会，他说：“我们有缺点，一定要改正，共产党正是为改进工作才要整风的呀！”他把手在床上一拍，接着说：“什么话，不要共产党的领导，不要党的领导难道会有今天吗？‘杀共产党……’‘政治设计院……’葛佩琦，储安平，章伯钧，罗隆基……他们到底是什么人？他们长的是什么心肝？不能光让这些别有用心的人胡说八道，人民应该说话，应该让人民说话！”由于愤怒，他的脸红了，我连忙紧紧地握住他的手。是的，人民要说话，人民是不能再沉默了，应该起来保卫我们革命的胜利果实，应该保卫我们亲爱的党！要和这些别有用心的右派分子进行坚决的斗争！我握住外祖父的手，感到他手的温暖，感到他身上还有无穷的生命力，他会活下去的！一定会活下去！
