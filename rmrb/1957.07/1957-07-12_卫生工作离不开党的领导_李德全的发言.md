    I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government and all other reports of the conference. Now I will give a brief report to the conference on some situations and problems in health work.

    Great Development of Health Undertakings
    Since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, China's health undertakings have greatly developed. The construction of health undertakings is reflected in: the number of health and epidemic prevention stations has increased from 61 in 1950 to more than 1,260 in 1956, an increase of nearly 20 times. The number of various disease specialized prevention and treatment centers (stations) (such as plague, schistosomiasis, malaria, kala-azar, etc.) has increased from 30 in 1950 to more than 600 in 1956, an increase of nearly 20 times. The number of maternal and child health stations (centers) has increased from 349 in 1950 to more than 4,560 in 1956, an increase of 12 times. The number of hospital and sanatorium beds nationwide has increased from 100,600 in 1950 to 328,000 by the end of 1956, an increase of more than two times. All counties (banners) across the country have established health centers or hospitals. The number of district health clinics has increased from 759 in 1950 to more than 13,000 in 1956, an increase of nearly 17 times. In addition, mass-run health institutions have also developed rapidly. The number of joint clinics has increased from 803 in 1950 to more than 51,000 in 1956. More than 600 joint maternal and child health stations have been established, and agricultural production cooperatives have established approximately 10,000 health stations, with approximately 100,000 practicing medical personnel. The health workforce has also expanded rapidly. In 1950, there were more than 41,000 Western-style physicians and pharmacists nationwide, increasing to more than 75,000 in 1956; 500,000 practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to strengthen the training of health cadres, 38 new and expanded higher medical colleges and 176 secondary medical and health schools were established, and training programs were gradually implemented for existing cadres. The number of students enrolled in higher medical colleges in the 1956-1957 academic year was 46,218, an increase of nearly three times compared to the highest number of students enrolled before liberation (11,855 in the 1947-1948 academic year).

    The above situation shows that the development of China's health undertakings is rapid; newly emerging specialized disease prevention organizations are gradually increasing; the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, mass-run health undertakings, and practicing doctors are all significant forces in the work.

    The basic task of China's health work is to prevent and treat diseases and gradually improve the health level of the people. In recent years, under the guidance of the principle of "prevention first," by organizing disease prevention and treatment forces, mobilizing the masses to carry out health campaigns, and implementing certain preventive health supervision and new midwifery methods, active prevention and treatment work has been carried out for various diseases, especially those that seriously endanger the health of the people. After the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft), prevention and treatment work has been newly improved and achieved certain results. Since the founding of the country, cholera has never occurred in China. Except for a very small number of cases in individual areas, smallpox has not occurred in most areas. In the future, universal vaccination should continue to eliminate the harm of this disease. Regarding plague, the occurrence of human plague has been basically controlled due to the implementation of preventive measures such as rat and flea extermination and vaccination. However, comprehensive preventive measures must continue to be strengthened to prevent plague from endangering the health of the Chinese people. Large-scale prevention and treatment work has been carried out for schistosomiasis, which seriously endangers the health of people in more than a dozen provinces and cities along the Yangtze River and to the south. According to incomplete statistics, in 1956 alone, the area where snails were eliminated reached more than 700 million square meters. At the same time, preventive measures such as fecal management and water source protection were implemented in epidemic areas, and more than 400,000 patients were treated. Effective experiences have been accumulated in both prevention and treatment work. For malaria, the epidemic situation has been clarified, prevention and treatment plans have been formulated, and prevention and treatment work has been carried out. The incidence rate has gradually decreased, and no outbreaks occurred in 1956. Regarding kala-azar, prevention work to eliminate sandflies has been carried out. In recent years, 600,000 patients have been treated, and the incidence rate in epidemic areas has also been significantly reduced. For the prevention and treatment of hookworm disease, preventive measures such as fecal management have been carried out in epidemic areas. In Sichuan Province, where the epidemic is more serious, approximately 4 million patients have been treated. Regarding tuberculosis, prevention and treatment work has been carried out with factories and mines as the focus; BCG vaccination has been carried out for children, reducing the harm of this disease. The mortality rate of measles in children has also decreased due to the strengthening of prevention and treatment work. In addition, some investigations, research, and prevention and treatment have also been carried out for epidemic encephalitis B, venereal diseases, leprosy, Kashin-Beck disease, Keshan disease, goiter, and occupational diseases in factories and mines (such as lead and benzene poisoning, silicosis, and heatstroke).

    In other major business areas, in implementing the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, in 1956, Western-style doctors were organized to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and two-year full-time study classes were opened, with more than 300 people participating in the study. Some cities organized six-month full-time study classes, and many more Western-style doctors participated in on-the-job learning. Some Western-style medical experts also began to study traditional Chinese medicine and medicinal herbs in conjunction with their own businesses. Various medical institutions have absorbed approximately 29,000 practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to participate in the work (21,000 in the health department and approximately 8,000 in other departments). The number of traditional Chinese medicine hospitals has developed, reaching more than 140. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have taken on more than 44,000 apprentices, and four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine have been established. Due to the implementation of the traditional Chinese medicine policy, the business of traditional Chinese medicine has been carried out, strengthening the force for the prevention and treatment of diseases; the political status of traditional Chinese medicine has been improved, and its enthusiasm has been brought into play, actively participating in disease prevention and treatment and contributing a large number of secret prescriptions and proven remedies. Western-style medical personnel have a further understanding of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to coordinate the supply and demand relationship of traditional Chinese medicine and gradually solve the problem of out-of-stock varieties in the supply of Chinese medicinal materials, the business of Chinese medicinal materials was transferred to the management of the health department in April 1957, and a professional meeting was held to arrange the production and supply of Chinese medicinal materials.

    In the work of medical scientific research, a long-term plan for national medical scientific research and scientific research topics for 1957 were formulated. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to "march towards science" and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the research enthusiasm of medical scientific researchers has generally increased. Scientists from medical colleges, hospitals, disease prevention, maternal and child health institutions, and biological products units in various regions actively carry out research work, and go deep into the field to guide the practical work of disease prevention and treatment. In the past year, new progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, research on antibiotics, and research in the prevention, basic, and clinical medicine aspects. Recently, under the leadership of the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, coordination and adjustment have been carried out for medical scientific research institutions and research forces, creating favorable conditions for carrying out research work with emphasis.

    In maternal and child health work, new midwifery methods have been vigorously carried out. With the cooperation of the Women's Federation and relevant units, nearly 500,000 midwives have been trained by the end of 1956. New midwifery methods have been basically implemented in cities; new midwifery methods in rural areas have been further improved, playing a great role in protecting the health of infants and mothers. The business leadership of children's health care institutions has been strengthened, and the incidence of infant diseases has decreased significantly. Regarding family planning, publicity of contraception knowledge has been carried out, technical guidance for contraception has been organized, and relevant departments have been assisted in the supply of contraceptive drugs and devices.

    In medical prevention work, district-based medical services have been piloted with preliminary experience. Medical and preventive institutions in urban and rural areas are mostly treating patients day and night, and are carrying out arduous and persistent labor to maintain the health of patients.

    In pharmaceutical administration work, in conjunction with relevant departments, the production and sales of medicines and equipment were planned and arranged, spot checks and supervision of medicines and equipment were strengthened to improve product quality, the revision of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia was actively carried out, the specifications and standards of medicines other than the Pharmacopoeia were drafted, and the specifications of medical devices were compiled.

    Health Work Needs Continuous Improvement
    However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in our work, such as the implementation of the "prevention first" policy is not comprehensive enough, the strength of epidemic prevention institutions is weak and the quality is very low; the preventive measures of medical institutions are insufficient; the Ministry of Health does not grasp the patriotic health movement tightly enough, and there is a problem of being tight sometimes and loose sometimes; preventive health supervision measures have not been well carried out. The mass line is not fully implemented in the work, the medical system is not perfect, and there are still serious shortcomings in the management of public medical care and sanatoriums, forming a serious waste phenomenon. Although the situation of discrimination against traditional Chinese medicine has changed somewhat, there is still a lack of proper measures and specific guidance in carrying forward the medical heritage of the motherland and developing the strength of traditional Chinese medicine. Not enough attention has been paid to uniting and bringing into play the role of Chinese and Western medical experts, and their opinions have not been well listened to. A good summary has not yet been made of the work of training cadres, and improvement plans that are in line with China's actual situation have not been formulated, and so on.

    We firmly believe that these shortcomings and problems can be gradually overcome by taking appropriate measures under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government.

    However, some people believe that China's health work has not fundamentally implemented the "prevention first" policy. We believe that this understanding is not in line with the actual situation. For example, the patriotic health movement, the elimination of diseases, the new midwifery methods for preventing neonatal tetanus in maternal and child health, the gradual implementation of preventive health supervision work in industrial hygiene, and the determination at this year's national health department director meeting that health grass-roots organizations must participate in health and epidemic prevention work, etc., are all carried out in accordance with the principle of "prevention first." However, the implementation of the "prevention first" policy is multifaceted and a long-term task. It is objectively impossible to complete these tasks in a very short period of time.

    In the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, great achievements have been made in recent years, and there are also some shortcomings. But some people only see the shortcomings and doubt the correctness of learning from the Soviet Union. This is obviously wrong. The shortcomings in learning from the Soviet Union are mainly manifested in the fact that when absorbing certain advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, we have not combined them well with China's actual situation. This is mainly a shortcoming in our work, and cannot be blamed on the Soviet experience. Learning from the Soviet Union will still be our direction in the future.

    To solve the problems existing in our work, we must conscientiously improve our work in accordance with the instructions given by Premier Zhou in his report. In April of this year, we convened a national health department director meeting, which determined that this year's work should follow the principles of consolidation, consolidation, improving quality, and running undertakings diligently and thriftily, so that this year's health work can be consolidated and developed, and preparations can be made for the implementation of the second five-year plan. In the work of disease prevention and treatment, we must conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention first" and the combination of health work and mass movements, adhere to the work method of the mass line, earnestly implement "prevention first" in all aspects of medical and health work, strengthen existing epidemic prevention institutions, actively carry out health supervision work, and further carry out the patriotic health movement.

    In 1957, the focus will still be on the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, plague, and malaria. Regarding plague, the epidemic of human plague has been basically controlled, and we must continue to strengthen prevention and treatment work to prevent the occurrence of this virulent infectious disease. Each province and city should formulate plans based on the Ministry of Health's plan, combined with the specific conditions of each place, distinguishing between major and secondary, urgent and less urgent, actively carry out prevention and treatment. Strive to achieve greater results this year.

    Regarding strengthening the leadership of grass-roots health organizations, in order to give full play to the role of grass-roots organizations based on the characteristics of the development of China's health undertakings, it is necessary to appropriately arrange and closely combine the grass-roots health organizations run by the state and the masses, as well as individual practicing doctors, so that they can each find their place. The construction of grass-roots health organizations must clarify the principles of relying on the masses, implementing the mass line, and "prevention first," and encourage the masses to run health undertakings. According to past experience, mass health organizations should not be too large or too concentrated, and should implement the principles of being conducive to production, simple and easy to implement, democratic management, and running undertakings diligently and thriftily. Organizational forms can be adapted to local conditions and be diverse, and attention should be paid to mass experience and creation. Based on the above spirit, existing grass-roots health organizations should be rectified and consolidated in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    Further implement the traditional Chinese medicine policy and improve the work of traditional Chinese medicine. Implementing the traditional Chinese medicine policy and inheriting and carrying forward China's medical heritage are related to the various tasks of the health department and the path of China's health work. It is necessary to strengthen ideological education work, gradually overcome various sectarian ideas, strengthen the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, and take proper measures to move forward steadily. Western-style doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine should continue to implement the principle of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, and sorting out and improvement." That is, systematically learn the theoretical system and clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine, and comprehensively grasp the reasonable and unreasonable parts of traditional Chinese medicine before they can be distinguished, so as to sort out and study, remove the dross and select the essence, and achieve the purpose of inheritance and promotion. However, this principle is the general principle and requirement for Western-style doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine, not a specific requirement for everyone participating in the study. Different objectives and requirements can be determined according to different objects, so that teaching talents and research talents can be cultivated through learning, and treatment talents can also be cultivated. The methods and methods of learning can also be diverse, so as to better realize this principle. Learning materials should start with classic works, then modern works, or modern works first and then classic works. In accordance with this spirit, full-time study classes and on-the-job study classes should be rectified. On-the-job learning can start with the theory or clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine. Appropriate encouragement and organization should be given to a small number of Western-style medical experts with a better theoretical foundation and rich clinical experience to learn and study traditional Chinese medicine. For the participation of traditional Chinese medicine in hospital work, appropriate rectification and careful summary of experience should be carried out, and earnest improvements should be made. For traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking on apprentices, assistance should be given to teachers and apprentices to make improvements in accordance with the principle of ensuring quality. Attention should also be paid to improving the academic level of existing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, overcoming difficulties, creating experience, and gradually running the existing four colleges of traditional Chinese medicine well according to the teaching characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine.

    Regarding improving the current medical system, district-based medical services should be implemented in cities with conditions to change the situation that some medical institutions only pay attention to medical treatment and not prevention, so that medical treatment and prevention are combined, hospital management is improved, ideological education is strengthened, the system is improved, and the level of medical care is improved. At the same time, the masses and patients should also be appropriately educated to cherish their medical institutions and correct certain phenomena that do not respect medical personnel. Actively seek ways to improve the public medical care system, strengthen the management of sanatoriums, give full play to the potential of sanatorium institutions, and overcome wasteful phenomena.

    Strengthen industrial hygiene work. Health departments and industrial departments should carry out work with mutual support and close cooperation. Local health departments at all levels should lead the various medical and health businesses of factories and mines, focusing on the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases, common diseases, and industrial injuries. They should urge factory and mine health agencies to formulate practical and feasible prevention and treatment plans, and gradually improve the unreasonable distribution and use of medical personnel. They should organize all medical personnel and rely on the broad masses of workers to do a good job in prevention and treatment. The funding, basic construction, and administrative leadership of factory and mine medical and health institutions, as well as the improvement of workers' working conditions, are still the responsibility of the industrial departments, and they should assist the health departments in doing a good job in business leadership.

    Regarding birth control, propaganda work should continue to be widely carried out, contraception should be actively promoted, technical guidance and drug and device research should be strengthened, and more convenient and effective methods should be sought.

    Medical education work should conscientiously summarize experience, study and determine the length of schooling, professional settings, training objectives, and plans of China's secondary and higher medical education according to China's specific conditions, the needs of national construction, and the development of medical science. Resolutely solve the internship bases for secondary and higher medical education, organize the compilation of teaching materials, and carry out scientific research in medical and pharmaceutical colleges and universities. Vigorously cultivate teachers and improve the quality of cadre training. At the same time, attention should be paid to the training of health cadres of ethnic minorities, and the improvement and advanced training of existing cadres at all levels should be strengthened.

    In pharmaceutical administration work, to solve the current serious shortage of varieties or quantities of traditional Chinese medicine to meet the needs of traditional Chinese medical business, the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials should be actively restored and developed, purchases should be carried out in a planned manner, the socialist transformation of pharmaceutical merchants should be continued, the leadership of the free market should be strengthened, the quality of supply should be improved, and business management should be improved, and out-of-stock varieties should be gradually reduced and resolved, under the principle of close integration of medicine, so as to better serve the people's health care cause. For Western medicines and equipment, attention should also be paid to solving the problem of variety shortages, improving product quality, and further strengthening inspection and supervision work. The pharmacy work of medical institutions should also be improved.

    Finally, we must clearly realize that the tremendous achievements of China's health undertakings, like other undertakings, are the result of closely relying on the leadership of the Communist Party and implementing the Party's policies. The work of the past few years fully proves that only under the leadership of the Party and the government, and resolutely implementing the Party's policies, can the people's health cause be advanced; any weakening or separation from the Party's leadership will bring damage to health work. The Party can lead scientific work and can lead health work, which is an unquestionable truth. Premier Zhou has made a brilliant criticism of the erroneous idea that the Party cannot lead scientific work in his report. However, there are indeed some people on the health work front who mistakenly believe that the Communist Party does not understand health science and technology and cannot lead this work. This erroneous idea is essentially an attack by right-wing elements on the Party and the people's health cause. We must resolutely fight against those who oppose the leadership of the Party and various right-wing elements, defeat the attack of right-wing elements, safeguard the leadership of the Party, and develop China's health undertakings. At present, our national health workers should actively participate in this struggle, and we will never give up until we win complete victory.

    卫生工作离不开党的领导
    李德全的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告和大会的其他各项报告。现在我就卫生工作的一些情况和问题向大会作简要的报告。
    卫生事业大发展
    建国以来，我国卫生事业在中国共产党和人民政府领导下有了很大的发展，卫生事业建设表现在：卫生防疫站由一九五○年的六十一个增至一九五六年的一千二百六十余个，增长了近二十倍。各种疾病的专业防治所（站）（如鼠疫、血吸虫病、疟疾、黑热病等）由一九五○年的三十所增至一九五六年的六百余所，增长了近二十倍。妇幼保健站（所）由一九五○年的三百四十九个增加到一九五六年的四千五百六十余个，即增长了十二倍。全国医院、疗养院床位由一九五○年的十万零六千张增加到一九五六年底的三十二万八千张，即增长两倍以上。全国各县（旗）都设立了卫生院或医院。区卫生所从一九五○年的七百五十九所增加到一九五六年的一万三千余所，即增长近十七倍。此外，群众举办的卫生机构也有了迅速的发展，联合诊所由一九五○年的八百零三所增至一九五六年的五万一千余所，联合妇幼保健站建立了六百余个，农业生产合作社约建立了一万个保健站，开业医务人员约十余万人。卫生队伍也迅速的扩大了，一九五○年全国有西医师、药师四万一千多人，一九五六年增至七万五千多人；中医五十万人。为了加强卫生干部的培养，充实和新建了三十八个高级医学院校，一百七十六个中级医药卫生学校，并逐步进行了对现有干部的培养训练。高级医学院校一九五六至一九五七学年在校学生为四万六千二百一十八人，较解放前最高年份（一九四七至一九四八学年）在校学生一万一千八百五十五人，增长了近三倍。
    以上情况说明：我国卫生事业的发展是迅速的；新兴的预防疾病的专业组织在逐步地增加；中医力量和群众举办的卫生事业以及开业医生均是重大的工作力量。
    我国卫生工作的基本任务是防治疾病，逐步提高人民的健康水平。几年来在预防为主方针的指导下，通过组织防治疾病力量，发动群众开展卫生运动和某些预防性的卫生监督、新法接生等，对于各种疾病，特别是危害人民健康最严重的疾病，进行了积极的防治工作。“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）公布后，防治工作有了新的改进，取得了一定的成绩。建国以来霍乱病在我国从未发生。天花病除个别地区发生极少数病例外，绝大部分地区均未发生，今后仍须继续普遍进行牛痘接种，以消灭这一疾病的危害。对鼠疫，由于开展了灭鼠、灭蚤和疫苗接种等预防工作，已基本上控制了人间鼠疫的发生，但仍须继续加强综合性的预防措施。不再使鼠疫危害我国人民的健康。对严重危害长江两岸及以南十多个省市人民健康的血吸虫病，开展了大规模防治工作。据不完全统计，在一九五六年内，消灭钉螺的面积达七亿余万平方公尺，同时在流行地区实行了粪便管理和水源保护等预防措施，治疗病人达四十余万人。在预防和治疗工作上都积累了一些有效的经验。对于疟疾，已摸清了流行情况，制定了防治规划，并进行了防治工作，发病率已逐步下降，一九五六年未发生暴发流行。对黑热病，开展了消灭白蛉的预防工作，几年来治疗患者达六十万人，病区的发病率也显著降低。对钩虫病的防治，在流行地区开展了粪便管理等预防措施，流行较重的四川省，治疗患者约四百万人。对结核病，以厂矿企业为重点，进行了防治工作；对儿童开展了卡介苗接种，减轻了这一疾病的危害。小儿麻疹也由于防治工作的加强，病死率有所降低。此外对流行性乙型脑炎、性病、麻风病、大骨节病、克山病、甲状腺肿，以及厂矿职业病（如铅苯中毒、矽肺、中暑等）也进行了一些调查研究和防治。
    其他几项主要业务工作方面，在贯彻执行中医政策上，一九五六年组织西医学习中医，开办了二年的脱产学习班，参加学习的三百余人，有些城市组织了六个月的脱产学习班，更有不少西医参加了在职学习，有的西医专家也结合本身业务，开始了对中医中药的研究工作。各医疗机构吸收中医参加工作约二万九千余人（其中卫生部门二万一千人，其他部门约八千人）。中医医院有了发展，已达一百四十余所。中医带徒弟四万四千余人，并举办了四个中医学院。由于中医政策的贯彻，中医业务有了开展，壮大了防治疾病的力量；中医的政治地位有了提高，积极性有了发挥，积极参加了疾病的防治工作和供献了大量的秘方验方。西医人员对中医有了进一步的认识。为了协调中医药的供求关系，逐步解决中药供应上的脱销品种等问题，中药业务已于一九五七年四月交由卫生部门管理，并召开了专业会议，对中药材生产供应作了安排。
    在医学科学研究工作上，制定了全国医学科学研究的远景规划和一九五七年的科学研究题目。自从中共中央提出向“科学进军”的号召和百家争鸣的方针后，医学科学工作人员研究热情普遍提高，各地区的医学院校，医疗、预防、妇幼卫生机构和生物制品等单位的科学家积极进行研究工作，并不辞辛苦深入现场，指导防治疾病的实际工作。一年来在防治血吸虫病，抗生素研究，以及预防、基础、临床医学各方面的研究工作，都有了新的进展。最近在国务院科学规划委员会领导下对于医学科学研究机构和研究力量进行了协调与调整，为有重点的开展研究工作，创造了有利条件。
    在妇幼卫生工作上，大力开展了新法接生，在妇联和有关单位配合下，到一九五六年底培训了接生员近五十万人。在城市基本上实行了新法接生；农村的新法接生，有了进一步的提高，对保护婴儿和产妇健康起了很大的作用。对儿童保健机关加强了业务领导，婴幼儿的发病率显著下降。关于节育工作，进行了避孕知识的宣传，组织进行了节育的技术指导，并协助有关部门进行了避孕药品和用具的供应工作。
    在医疗预防工作上，重点试行了划区医疗服务，取得了初步经验。城乡医疗预防机关，多是夜以继日的治病救人，为维护病人健康，进行着辛勤坚韧的劳动。
    在药政工作上，会同有关部门，计划安排药品器材的产销，对药品器材加强了抽验和监督，借以提高产品质量，积极进行了中国药典的修订工作，拟订了药典以外的药品规格标准和编辑了医疗器械的规范。
    卫生工作需要不断改进
    但是我们工作上也还存在着不少缺点和问题的，如预防为主的方针的贯彻不够全面，防疫机构力量薄弱、质量很低；医疗机构的预防措施不够；卫生部对爱国卫生运动抓得不紧，出现时紧时松的毛病，预防性卫生监督的措施，未能很好地开展。工作中贯彻群众路线不够，医疗制度不够完善，在公费医疗和疗养院的管理上还存在着严重的缺点，形成严重的浪费现象。歧视中医的情况虽有所改变，但在发扬祖国医学遗产，发扬中医力量上还缺乏妥善的措施和具体指导。对于团结和发挥中西医专家的作用重视不够，未能很好地听取他们的意见。培养干部工作上尚未作出很好的总结，并且制定切合于我国实际的改进方案等等。
    这些缺点和问题，我们坚信在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，采取适当措施，是完全可以逐步克服的。
    但是有人认为我国卫生工作根本没有贯彻预防为主的方针，我们认为这种认识是不符合实际的，如开展爱国卫生运动，消灭疾病，妇幼卫生中的预防新生儿破伤风而开展的新法接生，工业卫生中逐步开展预防性卫生监督工作，参加城市建设规划，今年全国卫生厅局长会议上又确定卫生基层组织，必须参加卫生防疫工作等等，都是按照预防为主的方针进行的。但贯彻预防为主的方针，是多方面的，而且是长期的工作，要想在很短的时间内就做完这些工作，客观上也是不可能的。
    在学习苏联问题上，几年来取得很大的成绩，也存在着一些缺点。但有的人却只看到缺点，而怀疑学习苏联的正确性。这显然是错误的。学习苏联中的缺点，主要表现在吸取苏联某些先进经验时，没有很好结合我国的实际情况，这主要是我们工作中的缺点，而不能怪苏联经验，今后学习苏联仍是我们的方向。
    解决工作中存在的问题，我们一定遵照周总理在报告中所指示的，切实改进我们的工作。今年四月间我们召开了全国卫生厅局长会议，确定了今年的工作应遵照整顿巩固提高质量和勤俭办事业的方针，使今年的卫生工作得以巩固的发展，为第二个五年计划的实施作好准备。在防治疾病工作上，必须切实贯彻预防为主和卫生工作与群众运动相结合的原则，坚持群众路线的工作方法，把预防为主认真贯彻到医药卫生工作的各项业务中去，加强现有的防疫机构，积极开展卫生监督工作，并进一步开展爱国卫生运动。
    一九五七年仍以防治血吸虫病、鼠疫和疟疾为重点。对于鼠疫，已达到基本上控制人间鼠疫的流行，还须继续加强防治工作，以防止这一烈性传染病的发生。各省市应分别主要次要、轻重缓急，根据卫生部规划，结合各地具体情况制定规划，积极进行防治。争取今年内取得更大的成绩。
    关于加强基层卫生组织的领导，根据我国卫生事业发展的特点，充分发挥基层组织的作用，必须把国家举办的和群众举办的基层卫生组织以及个体开业医生，适当地加以安排，密切结合，使之各得其所。基层卫生组织建设，必须明确依靠群众、贯彻群众路线和预防为主的原则，并鼓励群众办卫生事业。根据以往经验，群众性卫生组织不宜过大或过于集中，应贯彻有利于生产，简便易行，民主管理、勤俭办事业的方针。组织形式可因地制宜，多种多样，并重视群众经验和创造。依据以上精神，有计划有步骤地对现有基层卫生组织进行整顿和巩固工作。
    进一步贯彻中医政策，改进中医中药工作。贯彻中医政策，继承与发扬我国医学遗产关系到卫生部门各项工作和我国卫生工作的道路问题。必须加强思想教育工作，逐步克服各种各样的宗派主义思想，加强中西医的团结，并采取妥善措施，稳步前进。西医学习中医应继续贯彻“系统学习、全面掌握、整理提高”的方针。就是要系统地学习中医理论体系和临床经验，在中医的合理和不合理部分未能区分之前，应全面加以掌握，以便整理研究，去粗取精，达到继承和发扬的目的。但这一方针是西医学习中医的总的方针和要求，并不是对参加学习的每一个人的具体要求，可根据不同对象确定不同的目的和要求，既可通过学习培养教学人才和研究人才，亦可培养治疗人才。学习的方式和方法亦可多种多样，以便使这一方针更好地实现。学习教材，先由经典著作学起，再学近代著作，或先学近代著作再学经典著作均可。根据这一精神对脱产学习班和在职学习班加以整顿。在职学习，先从中医理论或临床经验学习均可。要适当地鼓励与组织少数理论基础较好、临床经验丰富的西医专家学习和研究中医。对于中医参加医院工作，应进行适当的整顿和认真总结经验，切实加以改进。中医带徒弟，应根据保证质量的原则，协助师徒加以改进。并注意提高现有中医的学术水平，根据中医教学特点，克服困难，创造经验，逐步办好现有四个中医学院。
    关于改进现行医疗制度，在有条件的城市实行划区医疗服务，改变某些医疗机关只重视医疗不重视预防的情况，使医疗与预防结合起来，改进医院管理工作，加强思想教育，改善制度，提高医疗水平。同时也应适当的教育群众和病人，爱护自己的医疗机关，改正某些不尊重医务人员的现象。积极设法改进公费医疗办法，加强疗养院的管理，发挥疗养机构的潜力，克服浪费现象。
    加强工业卫生工作，卫生部门和工业部门应在互相支持和密切配合下进行工作，各级地方卫生部门应把厂矿各项医疗卫生业务领导起来，以防治职业病、多发病和工业性外伤为重点，督促厂矿卫生机关制定切实可行的防治规划，并逐步改善医务人员的分配和使用不合理的情况，组织全体医务人员，依靠广大职工群众，作好防治工作。厂矿医疗卫生机构的经费、基本建设、行政领导，以及职工劳动条件的改善，仍由工业部门负责，并协助卫生部门作好业务领导工作。
    关于节制生育，应继续广泛开展宣传工作，积极提倡避孕，加强技术指导和药物用具研究，寻求更为方便而有效的办法。
    医学教育工作应认真总结经验，根据我国具体情况、国家建设的需要及医学科学的发展，研究确定我国高中级医学教育的学制、专业设置、培养目标和规划等问题。切实解决高中级医学教育的实习基地，组织编写教材，并开展医药学院校的科学研究工作。大力培养师资，提高培养干部的质量。同时应重视少数民族卫生干部的培养，加强各级在职干部的提高和进修工作。
    在药政工作上，解决当前中药的品种或数量上的严重脱销，以适应中医医疗业务的需要，应当积极恢复和发展中药材的生产，有计划地进行收购，继续完成药商的社会主义改造，加强自由市场的领导，提高供应质量，改善经营管理，逐步缩小和解决脱销品种，在医药密切结合的原则下，以便更好地为人民保健事业服务。对于西医药器材，也应注意解决品种脱销问题，并提高产品质量，进一步加强检验和监督工作。对医疗机关的药房工作亦应加以改进。
    最后，我们必须清楚的认识到我国卫生事业所以能够取得巨大的成就，也和其他各项事业一样，是紧密依靠共产党的领导，贯彻执行党的方针政策的结果。几年来的工作充分证明，只有在党和政府的领导下，坚决执行党的方针政策，才能把人民卫生事业推向前进；任何削弱或脱离党的领导，就会给卫生工作带来损害。党能领导科学工作，能领导卫生工作，是勿庸置疑的真理。对于认为党不能领导科学工作的错误思想，周总理在报告中已作了精辟的批驳。但在卫生工作战线上也确有些人错误地认为共产党不懂卫生科学技术，不能领导这一工作。这种错误思想实质是右派分子向党和人民卫生事业的进攻。我们必须坚决地与反对党的领导的以及各种各样的右派分子作斗争，击败右派分子的进攻，维护党的领导，发展我国卫生事业。当前，我们全国卫生工作人员应当积极地参加这一斗争，不获全胜，绝不罢休。
