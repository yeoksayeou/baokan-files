    Groups Contract Plots, Households Contract Ridges - Every Piece of Land Has Someone in Charge
    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the Beixianxian Village Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, implemented the method of field management with groups contracting fixed plots and households contracting fixed ridges in April, it has reversed the chaotic situation of disorganized agricultural work during the summer harvest and planting seasons of the past few years, and various agricultural tasks have been completed quickly and well.
    The cooperative's four production teams are divided into four economic crop zones. After each production team contracted work and output, it assigned various crops to groups based on the labor and technical conditions of each group. Within the groups, farming, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and pest control were done collectively, while weeding, pruning, and side-shoot removal were assigned to each household by ridge, with each household responsible to the end. For example, all tasks for cotton, from seedling cultivation after sowing to flower picking, such as weeding, thinning, pruning, and side-shoot removal, were the responsibility of the contracting household. When assigning agricultural work to households by ridge, in order to accommodate the labor convenience of members, balance work attendance, and avoid affecting production in the event of changing natural conditions, each household was assigned good land, bad land, near land, and far land. If the contracting members had other reasons for not being able to complete the contracted work, it could be adjusted and resolved by the group or the team.
    Since the cooperative implemented the method of groups contracting plots and households contracting ridges, the responsibilities have been clear, and members have a clear idea of how many points they earn for doing each type of agricultural work. There is no need to wait for the team leader to assign tasks or to score and calculate work points every day, which overcomes the long-standing problem of wasted work. Members go to the fields before the bell rings, and labor efficiency has increased by one-third. After the members have completed their plans on time and with quality, they are free to use their time as they wish. Wives and children can also go to the fields to help in the morning and evening. More than fifty elderly people, women, and children in the village who had never participated in labor in the cooperative have all投入 themselves into field production.
    Since household contracting of ridges facilitates members' own arrangement of production time, household sideline occupations have developed better than in the past, which has solved the problem of a lack of pocket money. The cooperative's leaders are also less busy than in the past. In the past, four full-time cadres were busy day and night, but since the implementation of this method, the number of full-time cadres has been reduced to two, and they can also participate in field labor.

### 组包片，户包垅  每块土地有人管

    组包片，户包垅  每块土地有人管
    本报讯　河北省邢台县北先贤村农业社从4月份推行组包片、户包垅固定地段的田间管理方法以后，扭转了几年来夏收夏种期间农活支配不开的混乱局面，各种农活完成得又快又好。
    这个社四个生产队，分四个经济作物区，各生产队在包工包产后，根据各组劳力和技术条件，把各种作物固定到组。在小组里，耕地、播种、收割、打场、除虫等农活是集体作的，锄地、整枝、打杈等农活则分垅包到各户，由各户负责到底。如棉花从播种后到摘花期间的锄苗、定苗、整枝、打杈等全由包工的户负责。在把农活分垅包到户时，为照顾社员劳动方便、出工平衡以及在自然条件变化情况下不影响生产，每户都分有好地、坏地、近地和远地。包工的社员如果有别的原因不能完成包工的活，还可由本组或本队调剂解决。
    这个社实行组包片户包垅的办法后，由于责任分明，作哪种农活挣多少分，社员心中有底，每天不用等组长派活，也不用评分计工，克服了长期以来的窝工浪费现象，社员不等打钟就下地了，劳动效率提高三分之一。社员们在按时按质完成计划后，就可以自由支配时间。早晨晚上老婆孩子还可以下地帮忙。全村有五十多个从来没在社内参加过劳动的老头、妇女和小孩，都投入了田间生产。
    由于户包垅后便于社员自己安排生产时间，家庭副业开展的比过去好，解决了缺少零花钱问题。社的领导干部也不像过去那样忙乱了。过去四个脱产干部日夜不闲还忙不过来，自从实行这个办法后，脱产干部减到了两个，他们还能参加田间劳动。
