Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 14th. Shanghai's news and publishing circles have recently held forums to comprehensively counterattack bourgeois rightists.

Many participants in these two forums exposed the facts of how Xu Junyuan, the deputy director of the First Editorial Office of Shanghai Culture Publishing House, who styled himself as an "old newspaperman," launched a frenzied attack on the people's news and publishing cause. During the rectification campaign, Xu Junyuan published an article in Wenhui Daily entitled "Should Newspapers Continue Like This?", attacking the Party newspaper for "only preaching" and "putting on a Communist Party member's face"; he also said, "Everyone is 'tearing down walls,' and the Party newspaper still wants to build a fortified village." Under the guise of "freedom of the press" and "relaxing news standards," he opposed the Party spirit of newspapers and incited newspapers to serve as fire starters for the rightists. Xu Junyuan also opposed the public side sending people to participate in joint public-private publishing houses. During the blooming and contending period, he used the Culture Publishing House's discussion on the system to encourage the original private personnel within the publishing house to restore private publishing houses such as "Guangyi," "Beixin," and "Guoguang," thereby undermining the Culture Publishing House. He shouted that he wanted to run "cooperative newspapers" and "cooperative publishing houses" that were not led by the Party.

At the meeting, many people exposed Xu Junyuan's reactionary history of serving as the deputy editor-in-chief of the Kuomintang's Central Daily News and the personal secretary of the anti-communist ringleader Yu Bin, rising to prominence through anti-communism and pro-Americanism, as well as his series of words and deeds that provoked the relationship between the Party and non-Party masses.

Shi Xiaochong and Wu Liexun of Academic Monthly exposed the absurd remarks of Shang Ding, a standing member of the Academic Monthly editorial board. Shang Ding was a student of Gu Zhizhong and Lu Yi. During the blooming and contending period, he feared that the world would not be in chaos and advocated the "theory that poisonous weeds must be cultivated," even advocating that Academic Monthly be run as a publication specializing in publishing poisonous weeds.

At the news forum, Liu Huozi, deputy editor-in-chief of Wenhui Daily, and others exposed some of Xu Zhucheng's remarks and actions against the leadership of the Communist Party. After the anti-rightist struggle began, Xu Zhucheng said with ulterior motives, "Those who are now speaking positively are all people who had problems in the past; those who are now speaking negatively are all progressive figures in the past." Wenhui Daily reporter and rightist Lu Wen made a vicious speech against the leadership of the Communist Party at a propaganda meeting convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Wenhui Daily editorial department considered it problematic and did not publish it in full. Xu Zhucheng was very dissatisfied and repeatedly said, "It should be published." Xu Zhucheng opposed Wenhui Daily's promotion of Marxist-Leninist theory, insisting that the theoretical propaganda in Wenhui Daily's "Social University" column was "dogmatism" and deliberately limited its space.

The news forum also exposed some anti-socialist remarks and actions by Wenhui Daily reporter Fan Yan and News Daily reporter Chen Weisi. Fan Yan, under the mission of the Zhang-Luo alliance, went to Hunan, Sichuan, and other places to start fires and reverse the verdict on Liu Shahe's "Grass and Trees." Chen Weisi used the Party's rectification movement to organize a discussion on "Why Have China's Important Codes, Criminal and Civil Law, Not Been Promulgated Yet," which slandered the government's political and legal work, touted the reactionary legal theories of rightists Wang Zaoshi and Yang Zhaolong, and started fires in the industrial and commercial circles three times, provoking the relationship between public and private sectors.

    上海新闻出版界全面开展反右派斗争
    揭露编辑记者中的败类
    新华社上海14日电　上海新闻、出版界连日来分别举行座谈会，开始全面反击资产阶级右派分子。
    参加这两个座谈会的许多人都揭发了以“老报人”自居的上海文化出版社第一编辑室副主任许君远向人民新闻出版事业猖狂进攻的事实。整风期间，许君远以“报纸应当这样干下去吗？”为题，在文汇报上发表文章，攻击党报“只顾说教”“摆着一付党员面孔”；并说“大家都在‘拆墙’，党报还想筑寨自固”。他借口“新闻自由”、“放宽新闻尺度”反对报纸的党性，煽动报纸为右派放火服务。许君远还反对公方派人参加公私合营出版社。他在鸣放中利用文化出版社对体制问题的讨论，怂恿这个出版社内的原私方人员恢复“广益”、“北新”、“国光”等私营出版社，借此搞垮文化出版社。他高喊要办不要党领导的“同人报社”、“同人出版社”。
    会上许多人揭发了许君远曾任国民党中央日报副总编辑、反共头子于斌的私人秘书，以反共亲美起家的反动历史和他挑拨党同非党群众关系的一系列言行。
    学术月刊的石啸冲、邬烈勋揭发了学术月刊常务编委尚丁的荒谬言论。尚丁是顾执中、陆诒的学生。在鸣放期间，他唯恐天下不乱，鼓吹“毒草必须培养论”，甚至主张把学术月刊办成专门刊登毒草的刊物。
    新闻界座谈会上，文汇报副总编辑刘火子等揭露了徐铸成等人的一些反对共产党领导的言行。反右派斗争开始后，徐铸成别有用心地说，“凡是现在说正面话的，都是过去有问题的人；凡是现在说反话的，却都是过去的进步人物。”文汇报记者、右派分子吕文在中共上海市委召开的宣传会议上作了反对共产党领导的恶毒发言，文汇报编辑部认为有问题，没有全文发表，徐铸成大为不满，屡次说“应该登”。徐铸成反对文汇报宣传马克思列宁主义理论，硬说文汇报“社会大学”一栏的理论宣传是“教条主义”，并蓄意限制它的版面。
    新闻界座谈会上还揭发了文汇报记者范琰和新闻日报记者陈伟斯的一些反社会主义言行。范琰受章罗联盟的使命，到湖南、四川等地放火，为流沙河的“草木篇”翻案。陈伟斯利用党的整风运动，组织污蔑政府政法工作的“我国重要法典、刑民法为何迟不颁布”的讨论，吹嘘右派分子王造时、杨兆龙的反动法学理论，并在工商界三次放火，挑拨公私关系。
