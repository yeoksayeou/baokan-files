    Maliciously Inciting Discord Between the Party and Non-Party Members
    Zhang Bojun Lit a Fire at the Railway Institute

    (Report from our newspaper) On May 18th, the rightist Zhang Bojun, in his capacity as Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, came to the Beijing Railway Institute and gave a report to the League members in the institute, lighting a fire.

    On June 21st, the China Democratic League branch of the Railway Institute held a branch meeting to make a preliminary exposure of Zhang Bojun's fire-lighting activities. On the 24th, 25th, and 26th, a series of symposiums were held to further expose Zhang Bojun's activities at the Railway Institute and to criticize rightists within the institute, such as Liu Jingxiang. The anti-rightist struggle is now being carried out in depth.

    Zhang Bojun provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses and between the Party and the democratic parties. Xiao Jiakui, an associate professor in the Economics Department, revealed that Zhang Bojun said at the meeting that day, "There are very few barbershops now, just this one in Wangfujing (referring to the Communist Party), but the requirements of this one are very high, requiring young people and those without problems on their heads. But people have to get their hair cut, so okay, let's have a few more barbershops, so that men, women, old, and young, and those with scars on their heads can all get their hair cut. Therefore, in addition to the CCP, there are also the Jiusan Society, the China Democratic League, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and other parties." Many people pointed out that this was a provocative statement against the relationship between the Party and the masses. Hu Xuchang, a staff member of the Infrastructure Office, and Qiao Run, a lecturer in the Economics Department, revealed that Zhang Bojun emphasized that there are three major things in life: material life, spiritual democracy, and freedom. He incited people by saying, "You eat well, live well, and wear suits, but if you put you in the western suburbs park, are you happy?" Zhang Bojun had ulterior motives in provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses, especially the relationship between the Party and senior intellectuals. Zhang Jianfei, a professor in the Russian language teaching and research section, exposed a very vicious statement by Zhang Bojun. He said: Zhang Bojun intentionally slandered and extremely maliciously distorted the leading relationship between the Party and the democratic parties, saying, "When I was the Minister of Communications, my relationship with my guard was: in terms of me being the Minister of Communications, I led him; but in terms of Party relations, he led me."

    Zhang Bojun organized and incited the masses to attack the Party at the meeting. Jiang Zongyan, a lecturer in the Telecommunications Department, said that at the symposium, someone said that this rectification campaign by the Communist Party was gentle and mild, and Zhang Bojun said, "I'm afraid it's not gentle and mild, it's a typhoon!" Hu Xuchang, a staff member of the Infrastructure Office, pointed out that Zhang Bojun had said something like this: "I am not afraid to make suggestions, I have no concerns. Since the start of the rectification campaign, the masses have made so many suggestions that Chairman Mao was not mentally prepared, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party was not mentally prepared." Yuan Xiutao, a staff member of the Infrastructure Office, said that Zhang Bojun mentioned in this conversation that Chairman Mao did not know about the implementation of the Party committee system in universities. Niu Zequan, a professor in the Transportation Department, said that Zhang Bojun's words had a great impact, making us think that Chairman Mao did not know about the implementation of the Party committee system in universities, which may not be appropriate. No wonder some people in universities have proposed that the Party committee withdraw from the school. Zhang Bojun's statement is alienating us from the Party! Niu Zequan said that Zhang Bojun's speech at the symposium was very vicious! He remembered that when Zhao Hua, a professor in the Architecture Department, said that he had concerns about helping the Party in the rectification campaign, Zhang Bojun then said, "You are not a self-employed person now, you have an organization, and the organization will support you!" Wang Zhongwu, a professor in the Economics Department, said that Zhang Bojun's report at the school was lively and vivid, and there were many praises after the report, proving that many people were poisoned. Wang Zhongwu, a professor in the Economics Department, went on to say that Zhang Bojun said aggressively: "Someone in the Ministry of Communications asked, what should we do if there are problems with the blooming? I support it. Someone at the Railway Institute also asked, what should we do if there are problems with the blooming at the Railway Institute? I also support it!" When he said these words, Zhang Bojun really looked like Cao Cao, as described in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, reciting poetry with a spear across his saddle.

    Why did Zhang Bojun come to the Beijing Railway Institute to set fire? Because the Beijing Railway Institute has Zhang Bojun's minions—the rightist Liu Jingxiang. Liu Jingxiang is the chairman of the China Democratic League Beijing Railway Institute branch and a professor in the Economics Department. After Zhang Bojun lit the fire, Liu Jingxiang also took the opportunity to rob.

    Under the command of Liu Jingxiang, the rightists actively took action. These rightists negated all the achievements of the past eight years, slandered the Party, slandered personnel work, and deliberately provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses and the dissatisfaction of the masses with the government.

    Many teachers exposed the ugly faces of rightists such as Liu Jingxiang. Now, the giant wave of defending socialism at the Beijing Railway Institute has overwhelmed the rampant rightist remarks. Although the rightist Liu Jingxiang said: "I myself have made serious mistakes, and it is not wrong to call me a rightist." However, he also tried to find excuses to quibble and refused to confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun.

    恶意挑拨党与非党的关系
    章伯钧在铁道学院点过一把火
    本报讯　5月18日，右派分子章伯钧以民盟副主席的身份，来到北京铁道学院，向院里盟员做报告，点了一把火。
    6月21日，民盟铁道学院支部召开了支部大会，对章伯钧的点火活动作了初步揭发，24日、25日、26日接连召开了座谈会，进一步揭发章伯钧在铁道学院的活动，并对院内右派分子刘景向等进行批判。现在反右派斗争正在深入开展。
    章伯钧挑拨党群关系和党与民主党派的关系。经济系副教授萧嘉魁揭发章伯钧那天在会上说“现在的理发店很少，只是王府井这一家（指共产党），但这家的要求又很高，要年轻的，又要头上没有毛病的。但是人又不能不理发，那好吧，我们就多来几家理发店，这样，就男女老少和头上有癞痢疤的都能理到发了。因此，除了中共之外，又产生了九三、民盟、农工民主党、民革、民建等各家”。许多人指出这是挑拨党群关系的言论。基建办公室职员胡序昌、经济系讲师乔润等揭发说，章伯钧强调了人生有三件大事：物质生活及精神的民主和自由，他进行煽动说“你们吃得好，住得好，穿上西装，但把你们放在西郊公园里，你们高兴吗？”章伯钧就是这样别有用心，挑拨党群关系，特别是党和高级知识分子的关系。俄文教研室教授张剑非揭露章伯钧一段十分恶毒的话。他说：章伯钧有意中伤和极端恶劣地歪曲了党和民主党派的领导关系，他说：“我作交通部长，我和我的警卫员的关系是：就我是交通部长说，我是领导他的；但是就党的关系来说，他却领导我了”。
    章伯钧在会上组织和煽动群众向党进攻。电讯系讲师姜宗琰说，在座谈会上，有人说这次共产党整风是和风细雨，章伯钧说：“恐怕不是和风细雨吧，是个台风！”基建办公室职员胡序昌指出章伯钧说过这样的话：“提意见我不怕，我没有顾虑。整风开始以来，群众提了这么多意见，毛主席没有思想准备，中共中央也没有思想准备”。基建办公室职员袁秀涛说，章伯钧在这次谈话中谈到高等学校实行党委制，毛主席还不知道。车务系教授钮泽全说，章伯钧这句话影响很大，使我们想到高等学校实行党委制，毛主席还不知道，这就未必妥当吧。难怪高等学校有人提出要党委退出学校了。章伯钧这种说法是使我们对党产生了离心作用！钮泽全说，章伯钧在座谈会上的发言是很恶毒的！记得当建筑系教授赵华说到帮助党整风，自己有顾虑，章伯钧就接着说，“你现在又不是单干户，你有组织啦，组织上会支持你啦！”经济系教授王仲武说，章伯钧来校报告，谈笑风生，有声有色，报告后赞声很多，证明有很多人中了毒。经济系教授王仲武接着说，章伯钧气势汹汹地谈到：“交通部有人问，鸣放出问题怎么办？我支持。铁道学院也有人问，铁道学院鸣放出问题怎么办？我也支持！”说这些话时，章伯钧真有点像三国演义上描写的曹操横槊赋诗时的神气。
    章伯钧为什么会到北京铁道学院来放火呢？因为北京铁道学院有章伯钧的小喽啰——右派分子刘景向。刘景向是民盟北京铁道学院支部主任委员、经济系教授。在章伯钧点火后，刘景向也好趁火打劫。
    在刘景向指挥之下，右派分子积极地行动起来了，这些右派分子否定过去八年的一切成绩，污蔑党，污蔑人事工作，有意挑拨党群关系和群众对政府的不满。
    许多教师揭露了刘景向等右派分子的丑恶面目。现在，北京铁道学院保卫社会主义的巨浪压倒了猖狂一时的右派分子的言论。右派分子刘景向虽然说：“我自己犯了严重的错误，把我称作右派分子，这一点也不冤枉”。但是，他又企图寻找借口进行狡辩，拒绝交代与章伯钧的关系。
