Bai Xiqing said: The Party and the government's concern for the people's lives and the superiority of the socialist system can be seen from the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis alone. Schistosomiasis has long threatened the vast population of twelve provinces and cities, but successive dynasties and the Kuomintang government have always ignored it. The Communist Party, however, began prevention and treatment work in 1950, and last year further proposed the policy of eliminating schistosomiasis. Under the personal leadership of the Party committee secretaries in various places, various methods have been adopted and significant achievements have been made.

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports at the conference. These reports use ironclad facts to illustrate the brilliant achievements of our motherland's socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the past few years. As a doctor, while cheering for these great achievements, please allow me to use an example from health work to illustrate the superiority of the socialist system and the infinite concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the people's health. This example is the Party and the government's strong leadership in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is the most serious disease endangering the health of our people and agricultural production. It is prevalent in 350 counties (cities) in twelve provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Basin and south of it, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shanghai. About 10 million people are infected, and about 100 million people are threatened. People suffering from this disease experience reduced labor capacity in mild cases, and complete inability to work in severe cases, leading to death. Children suffering from the disease often stop developing, and even after reaching adulthood (after the age of 20 or 30) they remain as short as teenagers. Women suffering from the disease often cannot have children in severe cases. Therefore, the population decreases, production declines, and even farmland becomes barren and villages are destroyed. Gengtou Village in Baifu Township, Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, was once a prosperous village with more than 1,000 households a century ago. By 1945, only two people remained in the entire village, with more than 90% of the deaths caused by schistosomiasis. In Xia Hongtang and Yang Village in She County, Anhui Province, 30 years ago, there were more than 100 households in each village, but due to the long-term prevalence of schistosomiasis, by the time of liberation, they had become desolate scenes with houses but no residents, and land but no farmers.

Schistosomiasis has a long history of prevalence in our country, but during the reigns of successive feudal dynasties and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this serious disease was allowed to develop without any prevention and treatment measures taken. After liberation, in order to protect the people's health and develop production, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government established specialized prevention and treatment institutions in key epidemic areas and carried out prevention and treatment work, achieving certain results and experience, starting in 1950. At the end of 1955, Chairman Mao made important instructions on the elimination of schistosomiasis. In 1956, the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also included the elimination of schistosomiasis in the plan. A nine-member group for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis was established under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the policy of eliminating schistosomiasis was put forward. Party committees at the provincial, municipal, special district, county, township, and cooperative levels also established leading groups for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, and administrative bodies also established prevention and treatment committees at all levels. At the same time, a series of meetings were held from the central to the provincial and municipal levels to formulate specific plans. More prevention and treatment institutions were established and prevention and treatment forces were strengthened. At present, 309 counties and cities have comprehensively carried out prevention and treatment work, establishing a total of 19 prevention and treatment centers, 236 prevention and treatment stations, and 1,346 prevention and treatment groups, and training more than 17,000 professional prevention and treatment cadres.

As of the end of March this year, 760,000 patients have been treated nationwide. The number of people treated has increased year by year. Most of the patients who have been treated have recovered their health and rejoined production. Some women who could not have children due to schistosomiasis have also given birth, and children who were not developing have developed. For example, in the Suzhou Special District, a follow-up examination of 40 farmer patients more than four months after treatment showed that 34 people had significantly recovered their labor capacity, accounting for 85%. One patient, Gao A Jin, often had bloody stools and could not work before treatment. The masses called him "Big Belly A Jin." Less than 10 months after treatment, his weight increased from 80 jin to 110 jin, his height increased by 7 cun (about 9 inches), and he could carry 100 jin while walking, equivalent to a full labor force. Another patient, Zhang Jinchun, 47 years old, from Kunshan County, cultivated 4.9 mu of land. In the past, he could not do heavy work due to schistosomiasis, often had to hire workers to help, and had difficulty in life, sometimes having to borrow money. After treatment, he recovered his health and labor capacity. He could do the production himself, and harvested 2,800 jin of rice in the autumn, becoming a surplus grain household, and his life greatly improved. In order to improve treatment efficiency, since the second half of 1956, mobile treatment in communes has been widely promoted, solving the contradiction between treatment and production. Since 1957, a three-day short-term treatment method (the original course was 20 days) has been promoted, saving farmers' hospitalization time. At the same time, outpatient treatment has also been carried out as a priority, making it convenient for people with light physical labor to avoid hospitalization.

Not only that, the Party and the government are leading the people in epidemic areas, the vast number of prevention and treatment cadres, and scientists, with full confidence, to take the following measures to move towards the great goal of eliminating schistosomiasis.

1.  Eliminate the intermediate host of schistosomiasis – Oncomelania hupensis. Many areas have taken advantage of the winter slack season to mobilize the masses to adopt various methods to carry out a concentrated campaign to eliminate snails. In 1956 alone, snail elimination work was carried out on an area of 700 million square meters. In 1957, the scope of snail elimination was further expanded. From January to March in the spring alone, snail elimination work was carried out on an area of 1 billion square meters. The quality of snail elimination is also constantly improving. In 1956, there were six snail-free townships in the country, and in the first quarter of this year, there were 145 snail-free townships (basically eliminating Oncomelania hupensis). In other areas where snail elimination has been carried out, the density of Oncomelania hupensis has been greatly reduced, reducing transmission.

2.  Manage feces to eliminate parasite eggs in patients' feces, eliminate the source of infection, and combine with the rural production and fertilizer accumulation campaign. This work has been widely promoted in various places. Implementing the practice of valuing feces as investment into cooperatives, unified storage and use, establishing field toilets, collecting wild manure, managing livestock manure, etc. In Jiangsu Province alone, 1,366 townships managed feces in the first half of 1956, and most of the feces of farmers and boatmen in the suburbs of Shanghai have also been managed, and management experience has been gained. This is currently being promoted in various places.

3.  Promote personal prevention to prevent infection. Various places have actively created some methods to enable the masses to avoid infection when going into the water to cultivate land, cut grass, and fish. New developments have emerged in this area this year. For example, in the spring of 1957 in Hunan Province, 210,000 farmers went to the lake to cut grass. Due to the adoption of personal preventive measures, it was ensured that large-scale infections did not occur. In Hubei Province and Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, protective measures were taken by mobilizing the masses in fishing and cutting lake grass this year, and no infection occurred, achieving the goal of ensuring safe production.

4.  Strengthen scientific research. A research committee for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis has been formed. In recent years, due to the Party's leadership in research work, scientists have embarked on the correct research path, going deep into the field, combining theory with practice, facing the masses, facing production, and seeking truth from facts, giving full play to the collective wisdom between scientists and the masses, thereby enabling research work to develop rapidly. For example, in terms of treatment, treatment methods have been improved through research, a three-day treatment plan has been proposed, and it has been promoted in various places; at the same time, large-scale research work has been organized on traditional Chinese medicine, and a number of effective prescriptions for treating schistosomiasis with traditional Chinese medicine have been proposed and promoted; certain clues have also been obtained in exploring new therapeutic drugs. In terms of prevention, a set of methods for managing feces and eliminating parasite eggs has been found in recent years, and various effective molluscicides have been discovered and tested, and water gas molluscicide, soil burial molluscicide, composting molluscicide, and the method of combining water conservancy construction and land reclamation for snail elimination in lake and swamp areas have been invented.

In December 1956, the Central Committee's Nine-Member Group also held the Third National Conference on the Prevention and Treatment of Schistosomiasis in Shanghai. After the meeting, the Central Committee approved and transmitted the key points of the 1957 prevention and treatment work drafted by the Nine-Member Group; the State Council issued instructions on the elimination of schistosomiasis; the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice on ensuring the implementation of the State Council's instructions on the elimination of schistosomiasis, instructing Party committees at all levels in schistosomiasis epidemic areas that those that have not yet established leading groups for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis should be established quickly, and their leaders should be a secretary of the Party organization, etc. According to this notice, Party committees at all levels further adjusted their organizations, with Party committee secretaries personally taking charge and going to the front line to supervise the battle, greatly strengthening the leadership of the prevention and treatment work, thereby further encouraging the fighting confidence and courage of the broad masses, prevention and treatment cadres, and scientists.

At present, although there are still many difficulties and shortcomings in this work, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, these difficulties and shortcomings will surely be overcome and improved on the road of advancement. We firmly believe that this work will surely achieve greater and more brilliant victories, like other socialist construction projects.

These achievements are great and were only made under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, something that could not be done during the reactionary rule.

However, since the Chinese Communist Party launched the rectification campaign, a group of bourgeois right-wing elements have emerged in society. They have taken advantage of the Party's call for the people to help the Party rectify its work, launching vicious slanders and smears against the Party, denying achievements, exaggerating shortcomings, distorting facts, confusing right and wrong, and setting fires everywhere in an organized, planned, programmed, and strategic way, provoking the relationship between the people and the Party, attempting to create chaos, and taking the opportunity to overthrow the socialist system, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and overthrow the Party's leadership, in order to achieve the restoration of the bourgeoisie. This conspiracy to betray the interests of the people cannot deceive the bright eyes of the masses. The broad masses have realized from their own experiences that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no great socialist construction, and they would once again be in a position of being exploited and oppressed, suffering from poverty and disease, and living in misery. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses have obtained the right to life, the right to health, and the right to happiness, and can embark on the bright future of socialism for generations to come. Right-wing elements! Your wishful thinking is wrong. The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have established an inseparable relationship, and in order to safeguard the Party's leadership and their own interests, the broad masses will surely resolutely repel the right-wing elements' rampant attacks and will not give up until the right-wing elements raise their hands and surrender, admit their guilt, and confess defeat.

    党和政府对人民健康无限关怀
    白希清说：从防治血吸虫病这一件事就可以看出党和政府对人民生活的关怀和社会主义制度的优越。血吸虫病长期威胁着十二个省市的广大人民，但是，历代王朝和国民党政府一直听之任之。而共产党从1950年就开始了防治工作，去年又进一步提出消灭血吸虫病的方针。这个方针在各地党委书记亲自领导下，采取多种办法，已经获得了显著的成绩。
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告以及大会上的其它几项报告。这些报告以铁的事实说明了几年来在中国共产党的领导下，我们祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉成就。作为一个医生，我在为这些伟大成就欢欣鼓舞的同时，请允许我以卫生工作中的一个实例来说明社会主义制度的优越性和中国共产党与人民政府对于人民健康的无限关怀。这个实例就是党和政府有力的领导了血吸虫病的防治工作。血吸虫病是危害我国人民健康和农业生产最严重的疾病。流行于长江流域及其以南的江苏、浙江、安徽、福建、湖南、湖北、江西、广东、广西、云南、四川和上海市等十二个省市的三百五十个县（市）内。患者约有一千万人，受威胁的人口约有一亿左右。凡患这种病的人，轻的劳动力减退，重的完全不能劳动，以致死亡。少年儿童患病后往往停止发育，达到成人年龄的（二、三十岁后）仍然像十几岁的儿童一样矮小。妇女患病后，严重的往往不能生育。因此，流行地区人口减少，生产下降，甚而田园荒芜，村舍毁废。江西丰城县白富乡的埂头村，百年前是一个一千余户，人口兴旺的村庄，至一九四五年全村就只剩下两个人，其中死亡于血吸虫病的达百分之九十以上。安徽省歙县的下洪塘、杨村等地三十年前均为一百余户以上的村屯，由于长期流行血吸虫病，解放时已变成有房无人住，有地无人种的凄凉景象。
    血吸虫病在我国的流行已有长久的历史，但在历代封建王朝和国民党反动统治时期，对于这一严重疾病是听其发展，未采取任何防治措施。解放后，中国共产党和人民政府为了保障人民健康和发展生产，自一九五○年开始，先后在重点流行地区建立了专业防治机构，开展了防治工作，取得了一定成绩和经验。一九五五年底毛主席对消灭血吸虫病作了重要指示。一九五六年中国共产党中央政治局提出的农业发展纲要（草案）又将消灭血吸虫病列入了规划。并且成立了中共中央领导的防治血吸虫病的九人小组，提出了消灭血吸虫病的方针。各省、市、专、县、乡、社也相继成立了党内防治血吸虫病的领导小组，行政上也成立了各级防治委员会。同时从中央到省市召开了一系列的会议，制定了具体规划。建立了更多的防治机构，加强了防治力量。目前已有三百零九个县市全面开展了防治工作，共建立了十九个防治所，二百三十六个防治站，一千三百四十六个防治组，培训了专业防治干部一万七千多名。
    到今年三月底止，全国已治疗患者七十六万人。治疗的人数逐年增加。凡经过治疗的病人，大部分恢复了健康，重新参加了生产，有些因患血吸虫病不能生育的妇女也生育了，不发育的儿童发育了。例如在苏州专区对治疗后四个月以上的四十个农民患者复查结果，劳动力显著恢复的有三十四人，占百分之八十五。其中有一患者叫高阿金，治疗前经常便血，不能劳动，群众叫他大肚皮阿金，治疗后不到十个月体重由八十斤增加到一百一十斤，身长增加七寸，并且能挑一百斤重走路，抵上一个整劳动力。另一患者叫张金春，四十七岁，昆山县人，种田四亩九分，过去因患血吸虫病不能做重活，常请人帮工，生活困难有时要借债，治疗后恢复了健康，恢复了劳动力，生产可以自己做，秋收得了二千八百斤谷子，成了余粮户，生活大大的改善了。为了提高治疗效率，自一九五六年下半年起，普遍推行了巡回驻社治疗，解决了治疗同生产的矛盾。从一九五七年起又推行了三日短程疗法（原疗程二十天），节省了农民住院的时间。同时还重点开展了门诊治疗，便利于体力劳动量轻的人，可以不必住院。
    不只如此，党和政府正在领导流行地区人民、广大的防治干部和科学家们，信心百倍的采取以下各项措施向消灭血吸虫病这一伟大的目标迈进。
    ⒈消灭血吸虫病的中间宿主——钉螺，很多地区都利用冬季农闲季节，动员群众采用各种方法，开展了突击灭螺运动。光一九五六年就在七亿平方公尺面积上进行了灭螺工作，一九五七年更进一步扩大了灭螺范围，仅仅春季一至三月就在十亿平方公尺面积上进行了灭螺工作。灭螺质量也在不断提高，一九五六年全国出现了六个无螺乡，而今年第一季度全国就出现了一百四十五个无螺乡（基本上消灭了钉螺），其余凡经过灭螺的地区，钉螺密度都大大的下降，减少了传染。
    ⒉管理粪便消灭病人粪内虫卵，消灭感染的来源，结合着农村的生产积肥运动，各地都普遍推行了这一工作。实行粪便折价入社，统一贮存、使用，建立田间厕所，收集野粪，管理家畜粪便等等。仅江苏省一九五六年上半年就有一千三百六十六个乡管理了粪便，上海市郊区农户及船户粪便也已大部管理起来了，并且取得了管理经验，目前各地正在推广。
    ⒊推行个人预防，防止感染，各地积极的创造出一些办法。使群众下水耕作、割草、打鱼时避免感染。今年在这方面已经出现了新形势，如湖南省一九五七年春季，二十一万农民下湖割草，由于采取了个人预防措施，保证了未发生大量感染。湖北省和江苏省高邮县在今年打鱼秧割湖草中发动群众采取了防护措施，也未发生感染，达到了保证安全生产的目的。
    ⒋加强科学研究工作，组成了防治血吸虫病研究委员会。几年来，由于党对研究工作的领导，使科学家们走上了正确的研究道路，深入现场，结合实际，面向群众，面向生产，实事求是的发挥了科学家和群众之间的集体智慧，从而使研究工作有了迅速的发展。例如在治疗方面，经过研究改进了治疗方法，提出了三日疗法的治疗方案，并已在各地径用推行；同时对中医中药也组织了大规模研究工作，提出和推广了一批中医治疗血吸虫病的有效方剂；在探索新的治疗药物方面也取得了一定线索。在预防方面，几年来找出了一套管理粪便和消灭虫卵的方法，发现和试验了多种有效的灭螺药物，发明了水煤气灭螺法、土埋灭螺法、堆肥灭螺法，以及湖沼地区结合兴修水利垦植灭螺法等等。
    一九五六年十二月中共中央九人小组又在上海召开了第三次全国防治血吸虫病会议。会后中央批转了九人小组拟定的一九五七年防治工作要点；国务院发布了关于消灭血吸虫病的指示；中共中央又下达了关于保证执行国务院关于消灭血吸虫病指示的通知，指示血吸虫病流行地区各级党委，凡是尚未建立防治血吸虫病领导小组的，均应迅速建立起来，其组长均由党组织的一位书记担任等。根据这一通知，各级党委又进一步进行了组织上的调整，党委书记亲自挂帅出马，赴现场督战，大大加强了对防治工作的领导，从而更加鼓舞了广大群众、防治干部和科学家们的斗争信心和勇气。
    目前在这一工作中，虽然还存在着许多困难和缺点，但是在中国共产党的领导下，这些困难和缺点一定会在前进的道路上得到克服和改进。我们深信这一工作必然会同其他各项社会主义建设一样，取得更大更光辉的胜利。
    这些成绩是伟大的，是在中国共产党的领导下，才作出了在反动统治时期所不能作到的事业。
    但是，自从中国共产党开展整风以来，在社会上却出现了一批资产阶级右派分子，他们利用党号召人民群众帮助党整风的机会，对党进行恶毒的诽谤和污蔑，否定成绩，夸大缺点，歪曲事实，混淆是非，有组织、有计划、有纲领、有策略的到处点火，挑拨人民群众和党的关系，企图制造混乱，乘机推翻社会主义制度，推翻人民民主专政，推翻党的领导，达到资产阶级复辟的目的。这种背叛人民利益的阴谋谲计是蒙蔽不了群众的明亮的眼睛的。广大人民从切身的体验认识到没有共产党的领导，就没有伟大的社会主义建设，就会再受到被剥削、被压迫的地位，就会贫病交加，民不聊生。在共产党领导之下，广大群众就取得了生活的权利、健康的权利、幸福的权利，才能走子孙万代的社会主义的光明前途。右派分子们！你们的如意算盘打错了，中国人民同中国共产党已经建立起来血肉不能分离的关系，广大人民为了维护党的领导，为了自己的利益，一定坚决击退右派分子的猖狂进攻，不到右派分子们举起双手缴械投降，认罪负输，决不罢休。
