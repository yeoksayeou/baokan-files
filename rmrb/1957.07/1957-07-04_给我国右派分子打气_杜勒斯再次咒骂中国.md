Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Washington News: Dulles reiterated his hostile remarks against China made on June 28 at a press conference held on July 2nd. This is the second time he has slandered China in just four days.

Dulles said that the United States has a "basic belief" and a "convenient working hypothesis" that the people's democratic dictatorship in China "will go bankrupt," and the United States executes its foreign policy based on this "hypothesis."

However, Dulles himself "doesn't know what the outcome will be" of his own "hypothesis." He said that the "evolution" taking place in China "may be" a so-called "revolutionary" one. Dulles is clearly encouraging the rightists in China here. But he admitted that this "seems impossible."

The U.S. Secretary of State said that he made that hostile speech against China on June 28 because he thought "the time has come to reaffirm this policy." He said that if the United States continued to remain silent, it would lead people to believe that its basic views had changed, and he said that the actual situation was not like this.

Dulles admitted that "some (allies) disagree" with the U.S. policy toward China. He said, "This clearly means that the U.S. policy is not as effective as everyone agrees it is."

A reporter asked Dulles how the U.S. policy of hostility toward China could be reconciled with the disarmament agreement being negotiated. Dulles, on the one hand, hopes to reach a disarmament agreement that excludes this big country with a population of 600 million, and on the other hand, hopes to "get assurances from China that may be possible."

Dulles also talked about the Korean issue, the issue of "aid" to Jordan, and the establishment of a so-called aerial inspection zone in Europe. When talking about the Korean issue, Dulles expressed his unwillingness to hold an international conference to discuss the reunification of Korea, and reiterated that "free elections" should be held under the auspices of the so-called United Nations.

When talking about the Okinawa issue, Dulles once again exposed the colonial ambitions of the United States. He expressed the hope that the American flag would "fly forever on that base." However, considering other opinions, the best solution is to "leave the residual sovereignty to the Japanese" and "give the United States the control and administrative power for a period of time that it deems appropriate." The so-called "appropriate length of time" is to be judged by the United States.

    给我国右派分子打气
    杜勒斯再次咒骂中国
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：杜勒斯在7月2日举行的记者招待会上重申他在6月28日发表的敌视中国的言论。这是他在短短的四天以内第二次诬蔑中国。
    杜勒斯说，相信中国的人民民主专政“将要破产”，是美国的一个“基本的信念”，也是一个“便于工作的假设”，美国就是根据这个“假设”来执行它的外交政策的。
    可是，杜勒斯对他自己的这个“假设”也“不知道结果会如何”。他说，在中国发生的“演变”“可能是”所谓“革命性的”。杜勒斯在这里显然是给中国的右派分子打气。但是，他又承认，这“看来是不可能的”。
    美国国务卿说，他在6月28日发表那篇敌视中国的演说，是因为他认为“重申这项政策的时候已经到了”。他说，美国如果继续保持沉默，就会使人认为它的基本观点已经在改变了，他说实际情况并不是这样。
    杜勒斯承认，“有些（盟国）不同意”美国的对华政策。他说，“这显然意味着美国的政策不像每个人都同意它那样有效”。
    有记者问杜勒斯，美国敌视中国的政策和正在谈判的裁军协定如何协调。杜勒斯一方面希望达成一个把这个六亿人口的大国排斥在外的裁军协议，另一方面又希望“从中国得到保证也许可能”。
    杜勒斯还谈到朝鲜问题、对约旦“援助”问题和在欧洲建立所谓空中视察区问题。在谈到朝鲜问题时，杜勒斯表示不愿举行国际会议讨论朝鲜统一问题，而重申要在所谓联合国主持下举行“自由选举”。
    杜勒斯在谈到冲绳问题时再一次暴露了美国的殖民野心。他表示希望美国的国旗“在那个据点上永远飘扬”。但是，考虑到其他意见，最好的解决办法是“把残缺的主权留给日本人”，而“给予美国以它认为适当长短时间内的控制和行政权”。所谓“适当长短时间”要由美国来判断。
