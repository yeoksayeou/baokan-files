Speaking as a publishing worker, I want to discuss the problems in the current publishing industry.

The publishing industry involves a wide range of aspects and many contradictions. There are different views on its nature and basic tasks, not only in society as a whole but also within the publishing industry itself. Due to time constraints, I will not discuss these broad issues but will focus on some specific problems.

I. Achievements of the Publishing Industry

Since the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai pointed out the problems of book shortages and poor quality last year, and after the right-wing elements exaggerated the situation, a fairly widespread common feeling arose among intellectuals: it seemed as if the publishing industry after liberation had only shortcomings and no achievements. In fact, the achievements are still the main aspect. I will briefly discuss the achievements of the publishing industry in the past eight years from the perspectives of transformation and construction.

The modern publishing industry run by the Chinese people themselves began with the Commercial Press in 1897 (the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty). In the sixty years since then, although there have been hundreds of publishing houses of various sizes, most of them, except for a few progressive bookstores, engaged in internal competition and even speculation under the banner of "cultural undertakings." At the same time, under the limitations of the objective conditions of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society in the past, both in terms of writing and publishing, they were inherently deficient, and the publications could not meet the needs of the people. Moreover, with the infiltration of speculative merchants, many harmful books were promoted to the hands of the broad masses of people. Most of the publishing houses before, with very few exceptions, did not have editorial staff. After the mainland's liberation in 1949, the socio-economic foundation changed, and the old business methods became unsuitable. As a result, most of the publishing houses at that time could not survive on their own. In the autumn of 1950, the People's Government convened a national publishing conference. In October of the same year, the Government Administration Council issued ten instructions based on the principles of "overall planning and comprehensive consideration, division of labor and cooperation" decided by the national publishing conference. The Publication Administration, based on the division of labor in publishing, distribution, and printing, and the principles of publishing specialization, carried out the transformation of the old publishing industry, strengthened the leadership of Xinhua Bookstore, and accelerated the construction of new publishing houses.

Since the National Publishing Conference in 1950, the publishing administrative departments have promoted the professional division of labor between private and public sectors in publishing. In distribution, Xinhua Bookstore was the main force, specializing in distribution work, allowing publishing houses with the conditions to continue operating. For those publishing houses without the conditions to publish, unified arrangements were made, merging those with similar characteristics and employing all personnel under a unified plan. After 1951, the publishing industry gradually embarked on an organized and planned path. By 1956, all legitimate private publishing houses nationwide had been merged into nineteen joint state-private publishing houses, and private publishing houses became a historical term. As a result, the number of books and periodicals suitable for the needs of the people increased year by year, and harmful publications gradually disappeared. Moreover, through the unified distribution of Xinhua Bookstore and the postal service's distribution of newspapers and periodicals, the circulation of books and periodicals greatly increased. People in any remote area of the country could buy publications and newspapers from various publishing houses at almost the same time, without paying extra for "regional price differences." This is the achievement of the transformation in the publishing industry.

In terms of construction, in addition to the establishment of several specialized publishing houses by many departments of state organs, there are also publishing houses in various localities (a total of 101 nationwide). In the past eight years, not only have various specialized books and local and popular publications increased year by year, and book prices have been reduced by 50%, but also the quality has improved year by year. The following is a comparison of the book publishing situation from 1950 to 1956 with that of 1936 (the year with the highest number of publications before liberation) to demonstrate the achievements of China's publishing industry after liberation.

Annual Book Publication Statistics

Year | Number of Titles | Number of Copies (thousands)
------- | -------- | --------
1936 | 9,438 | 178,000
1950 | 12,153 | 274,633
1951 | 18,300 | 703,304
1952 | 13,970 | 788,744
1953 | 18,384 | 754,519
1954 | 19,177 | 939,962
1955 | 22,538 | 1,079,574
1956 | 30,196 | 1,786,435

Notes:
1. The number of titles for each year includes both first editions and reprints.
2. The figures for 1956 are preliminary statistics.
3. The numbers in the table all include textbooks.

From the above figures, it can be seen that in 1956, the number of books published in China was more than three times that of 1936, and the number of copies was more than ten times that of 1936. From 1950 to 1956, a total of 241 works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were published, with more than 27 million copies. The right-wing elements now say that the shortcomings of various undertakings in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party are the main aspect. I hope they will look at the above facts and then slap themselves hard in the face!

II. Major Problems in the Publishing Industry

Now let's talk about the main problems in the publishing industry:

1.  The Problem of Book Shortages: Last autumn, some popular books were heavily overstocked, as reported in many newspapers, and many people attributed it to the poor system of Xinhua Bookstore. However, according to my understanding, the so-called "overstocking" was largely related to the rashness in the leadership of the Ministry of Culture at that time and cannot be solely blamed on Xinhua Bookstore. The problem of "overstocking" is now a thing of the past. The most important problem is "shortage." Since last autumn, with the separation of Chinese language and literature in middle schools, most teachers and students cannot even buy old textbooks like "Three Hundred Tang Poems," nor are there new dictionaries and reference books suitable for primary and middle school students. For several years, everyone has wanted to study Lu Xun, but it has been difficult to buy the "Complete Works of Lu Xun." Many valuable rare books, fine editions, and posthumous works have not been heard of being collected and published in a planned way. The larger publishing projects edited by the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company in the past, such as the Ciyuan and Cihai dictionaries, the Sibu Congkan and Sibu Beiyao series, and the Twenty-Five Histories published by the Kaiming Bookstore, have not been heard of being planned by any publishing houses. This type of work is the heavy industry of the publishing business, which cannot be completed without eight to ten years of time and a lot of manpower and resources. If we do not catch up now, and publishing houses do not recruit talents, collect materials, enrich libraries, and carry out planned operations, after the "older generation passes away" and materials and books are lost, there will be no one to sort out and print ancient books, and there will be few books to rely on, which will cause irreparable damage to culture. Another reason for the shortage of books is the inappropriate distribution of books by the distribution department. Xinhua Bookstore's distribution system can distribute books published nationwide to all regions in a short period of time, and its organization is suitable for the needs of socialist construction. After liberation, the circulation of books has increased more than tenfold compared to 1936, which is inseparable from the efforts of Xinhua Bookstore's distribution system and its staff. However, due to shortcomings in their work, they cannot better grasp the needs of readers. Many reference books necessary for academic research cannot reach the readers who need them. At the same time, the number of specialized books needed is not large, and Xinhua Bookstore often focuses on business considerations and is unwilling to reprint them, resulting in a shortage of some books that could be supplied.

2. Raw Materials for Publications: There are some problems with paper, ink, platemaking equipment, etc., related to publishing, but the most important is the lack of domestic handmade paper. Now let's briefly talk about this issue.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai publishing industry needed a lot of handmade paper such as Lian Shi, Mao Bian, and Xuan paper for printing ancient thread-bound books. The source was to order from workshops in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces that specialized in making native paper. Shanghai's paper mills also made machine-made Lian Shi and machine-made Mao Bian, but their quality was not as good as handmade paper and was prone to weathering and deterioration. With the start of the Anti-Japanese War, thread-bound books were greatly reduced, and Chinese-style account books and students' calligraphy practice books were also not used or greatly reduced. As a result, the production of handmade paper was greatly reduced. Some technicians who originally manufactured native paper gradually changed careers, and the production of machine-made Lian Shi and Mao Bian has basically stopped. In the past one or two years, due to the gradual increase in demand, handmade paper has gradually recovered, but the produced Mao Bian paper is thicker and not suitable for thread-bound books. Lian Shi paper is also limited in production because it is not easy to obtain bleaching powder in rural areas. Last year, handmade paper was listed as a national unified procurement material, and after the supply and marketing cooperatives unified procurement and supply, the quantity and quality of handmade paper needed by the publishing industry could not be supplied. In the first half of this year, several publishing houses in Shanghai that needed handmade paper sent people to Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places to investigate the production of native paper, intending to establish contact with handicraft paper workshops, but because the supply and marketing cooperatives were not responsible for supplying cultural paper, there were no results. The Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and Classical Literature Publishing House also only obtained a portion of the native paper needed for printing ancient books. In the future, the amount of paper used for books published with handmade paper will become larger and larger. Therefore, if this problem is not resolved, it will greatly affect the future work of publishing ancient books.

3. Cadre Problems: Although China has had a modern publishing industry for sixty years, there has never been a specialized organization to train cadres. All publishing workers have learned from experience in their work, so there are not many publishing professionals, especially editing professionals, left over from the old society. As of 1956, the staff of the 101 publishing houses nationwide, according to incomplete statistics, totaled approximately 9,690 people, of whom approximately 3,730 were editors (6,540 in central-level publishing houses, of whom 2,680 were editors, and 3,150 in local-level publishing houses, of whom 1,050 were editors). The ratio of non-editorial staff to editors in publishing houses is approximately three to one (five to one in Shanghai). From this figure, it can be seen that there is a lack of editorial staff and the proportion of non-editorial staff is too large. This ratio of non-productive to productive personnel is not in line with the operating methods of socialist cultural undertakings, and it also shows that it is necessary to step up the training of editorial cadres.

Because publishing workers have always been intellectuals who started on their own, some people in society believe that all intellectuals can do publishing work, so they do not pay attention to training. In fact, a university graduate can teach or do scientific research work after a short period of professional training, but it is difficult for them to work as an editor in a publishing house. Although there are now more than 3,000 editors, less than one-fifth can work independently, and there are even fewer professional editors specializing in Chinese ancient books. Although there are many publishing administrative staff, their quality is generally not as good as that of the editorial staff. Xinhua Bookstore has 3,450 branches, outlets, and bookstores, with 33,999 employees, but their general education level is that of a senior primary school graduate, and a small portion are middle school graduates. There are very few university graduates, and even fewer university graduates.

Some of the current shortcomings in publishing and distribution, in addition to objective circumstances and the dogmatic regulations of the leadership, are also largely due to the low quality of the editorial, publishing, and distribution cadres. As China's economic construction becomes increasingly prosperous, the people's demand for cultural life will inevitably increase. The quality of the current editorial, publishing, and distribution cadres must be improved, and the number must also be increased. The state must formulate a long-term training plan as soon as possible.

4. Organizational Leadership Problems: On October 28, 1950, the Government Administration Council issued ten instructions "On Improving and Developing the National Publishing Industry," one of which was that state administrative departments and local and people's organizations should establish publishing houses or editorial departments as much as possible. At the same time, starting from the People's Publishing House, the internal organization of each publishing house discarded most of the technologies and experiences that could be adopted from the old Chinese publishing industry. Insufficient consideration was given to the material conditions in China's publishing work, such as the characteristics of the writing structure and typesetting methods, and how to organize and manage China's publishing industry under the current level of productivity to ensure publishing production and maximize its power. And also, the number of high-level intellectuals in China is only 100,000 (the Soviet Union has 6 million experts with secondary education or above), the question of how many publishing houses can afford the source of manuscripts, these problems were not considered comprehensively. After 1951, many departments of central state organs, as well as localities and organizations, had the organization of specialized publishing houses. However, the development is uneven. For example, the construction department has the China Building Industry Press and China Building Materials Press, but no agricultural publishing house. The leadership is also very divided: the publishing houses of various professional departments are led by the national institutions of various professions, and the music publishing house, youth publishing house, etc. are led by the Chinese Musicians Association and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, etc. The local publishing houses are led by the local administrative organs.

Although the Publication Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has overall responsibility for the business of central-level publishing houses, it only manages their publishing plans and publishing systems for publishing houses directly under various departments of the People's Government and people's organizations. The editorial business, topic selection plans, and cadres are managed by their direct superiors. As a result, in terms of division of labor, the phenomenon often occurs that publishing houses are soliciting manuscripts on one hand, and on the other hand, there are manuscripts but no publishing houses to publish them. There are also many places where publishing house administrative organizations and cadres are wasted. This is one aspect of the organizational leadership problem.

Secondly, there is the leadership ideology of the publishing administrative departments. After liberation, the publishing administrative departments have made great achievements in the transformation and construction of the publishing industry, as I have already mentioned. However, the leaders do not pay enough attention to and do not grasp the essence and characteristics of the publishing industry, and there is a tendency in their thinking to regard the publishing industry as a purely enterprise. Although their management of publishing houses has regulations for supervising publishing houses to implement the Party and state's policies and tasks and improve the quality of publications, in practice, they often focus on the number of words, titles, copies, paper usage, and pricing of publishing houses, and increase tasks for distribution departments every year according to proportions. Therefore, in order to complete the numerical targets, publishing houses sometimes have to publish books that are divorced from the needs of readers, and they dare not make long-term plans and edit and print large books, but only focus on short-term pamphlets. In order to complete the sales targets, the distribution departments sometimes have to use methods of apportionment to complete their tasks. Secondly, publishing is a tool of class struggle and an academic enterprise. Its task of enterprise management is only meaningful when it is completed under the condition of implementing the national cultural and educational policies and meeting the requirements of readers. The payment of profits should not be listed as the main purpose. In 1956, the Shanghai People's Publishing House paid 2.09 million yuan in profits, and the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House paid 2.65 million yuan, with the two companies paying a total of 4.94 million yuan. The First Industrial Bureau, a real industrial department, only paid 3.6 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the cultivation of publishing cadres, the enrichment of book materials, and the editing and printing of large books are conditional on the internal economy of the publishing department. Furthermore, in terms of editorial work, the editorial work system stipulated by the Publication Administration in July 1952 overly emphasized the three-review system and the political responsibility for manuscripts, making it difficult for editors to meet authors, let alone make friends. On the one hand, editors are required to review the manuscripts of experts and assume responsibility for all errors in publications, but their treatment is far from commensurate with their work. For example, the Shanghai People's Publishing House has published many specialized books, but to this day, not a single one has the treatment of a senior intellectual. In addition, since 1950, a national publishing conference has not been held again, nor does the publishing worker have his own organization. This is another aspect of the organizational leadership problem.

5. Woodblock Printing Plates: China's woodblock printing plates originated in the Five Dynasties. There is still the Diamond Sutra published during the Xian Tong period of the Tang Dynasty, which is a work of art left over from the 9th century AD. The fine editions of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, when opened, seem to have a spirit coming to greet people. They not only preserve many cultural heritages of the motherland, but also preserve many carving arts. If we do not pay attention to these printing plates now, after a while, these printing plates will gradually disappear due to mold, rot, and insect erosion, and it will be too late to regret it in the future.

The Ancient Books Publishing House once hired experts to investigate the situation of woodblocks in Hangzhou, Nanxun, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Wuchang, Nanjing, and other places, and has seen approximately 500,000 woodblocks, many of which are rare editions, such as the "Secret History of the Mongols" stored in Changzhou and the "Hanxuetang Series" stored in Yangzhou. According to reports, the printing plates in various places are generally stored by the local cultural bureaus in dilapidated houses, carefully guarding the keys to prevent theft, but they do not care whether they are damaged by moisture or insect erosion. As for cleaning, they think that firstly, there are no empty houses, and secondly, there are no funds. In terms of manpower, it is not the main difficulty, because the staff of the local cultural and historical museums are willing to volunteer (the Guangzhou Cultural and Historical Museum has undergone a large-scale expansion in the past year, and the staff are around 30 years old. They have the distress of having nothing to do). In some places, the leadership does not pay enough attention, and the handling of the printing plate problem is improper. For example, in Guangzhou, four cadres and more than 20 family members live in the houses where the printing plates are stored, and it is difficult to guarantee that the printing plates are not damaged. The printing plates of the Nanjing Official Bookstore have all disappeared. The former Cultural and Education Department of the Central South Administrative Region once conducted a survey and statistics on the existing printing plates in various places in the Central South Region, but now even the archives cannot be found. The two kinds of printing plates of the "Sequel to the Remains of Changzhou Philosophers" and "Yuzhai's Extant Manuscripts" from the collection of Sheng Xuanhuai's family were taken away by the Shanghai Housing Management Bureau when it received Sheng Pinchen's furniture in September and October 1952, along with 108 frames of printing plates and dozens of boxes of Yuzhai's official documents. At that time, some of them were sent to auction houses for auction, and some were placed in the warehouse of the Housing Management Bureau, and there is no news of them later. There are also a few privately-owned printing plates for sale, but no one buys them. Some people are willing to donate the printing plates, but they cannot find an organization to accept the donation.

The above is only a part of the report. From this, it can also be seen that the wood carving printing plates, one of China's important cultural heritages, are at a critical juncture of "life and death." The state needs to carry out planned rescue work as soon as possible.

III. Several Suggestions

1. Hold a National Publishing Conference to solve problems related to various parties: The publishing industry involves a wide range of aspects. In addition to the relationship between authors, readers, and publishing, editing, printing, and distribution, it also involves issues related to paper, ink, photographic equipment, hardware supplies, machine manufacturing, etc. Although the publishing business is managed by the Ministry of Culture, and the editing, topic selection, and other plans are led by professional departments, the Ministry of Culture and various professional departments cannot completely solve the problems in all aspects of publishing, especially the problems of handmade paper and foreign trade, and even less can they solve the problem of social understanding of the publishing industry. Therefore, it is suggested that the Ministry of Culture first organize the materials on publishing issues exposed by various newspapers last year and the propaganda conferences and rectification movements this year into several questions, and then invite relevant personnel to discuss them. After summarizing some of the main problems, a national publishing conference should be held regularly. In addition to personnel related to publishing, editing, printing, and distribution (including postal services), people from various types of authors, various types of readers (the staff of various types of libraries can be the main representatives of readers), and relevant departments such as the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and supply and marketing cooperatives should also be invited to participate in the conference. This conference should solve some problems. My preliminary opinions are: ① Determine the future policy and tasks of the publishing industry. ② Obtain a roughly similar understanding of the nature of the publishing industry and its basic tasks. ③ Solve the main contradictions between publishing, distribution, and printing, such as the decision-making power of publishing and distribution over the number of books printed and the economic responsibilities of both parties, and how printing can improve quality and better serve publishing. ④ Should the publishing houses of various departments and localities be comprehensively adjusted, and how should they be adjusted. ⑤ How to adjust the system, and how to summarize and utilize the publishing experience of old China (now many people advocate restoring the "three-in-one" system of publishing, printing, and distribution of the former Commercial Press, etc. I think that some publishing houses with special conditions or special needs, such as the Zhonghua Book Company having a printing factory, and the Science Publishing House needing a professional printing factory, can set up their own printing factories. Except for the Postal and Telecommunications Publishing House, which has the conditions to set up distribution offices in the post and telecommunications bureaus, it is not appropriate to regard the old "three-in-one" system as the system of publishing houses today: because Xinhua Bookstore's distribution system can already supply the whole country, if publishing houses want to set up a separate distribution organization, they must set up another set of transportation, warehousing, and management systems, which is the biggest waste, and the effect can be determined to be not as good as Xinhua's; printing factories are mechanical industries, and machines often need to have certain tasks. Publishing books is a mental work, and it is difficult to arrange work like machines. If publishing houses have printing houses, they have to run around printing parts for it every day. Publishing houses do not need to set up printing factories unless there are special needs or special conditions, which will waste state funds. Therefore, I do not advocate restoring the old publishing system). ⑥ The relationship between authors and publishing houses and their mutual responsibilities, especially the long-unresolved issue of royalties. ⑦ How to improve distribution work so that various books and periodicals can reach the readers who need them more promptly. ⑧ Should publishing workers have their own organizations, how to organize them, so that everyone can use this organization to strengthen learning and improve their political and professional level. ⑨ Cadre training methods. ⑩ Others. This conference should be held as soon as possible, because there are many problems in the publishing industry that must be solved, but there must be sufficient preparation, and it should not be done hastily for the sake of speed, which would be equivalent to not holding it.

2. Use various methods to train cadres: At present, the quantity and quality of editorial cadres are not high, and the quantity of publishing administrative and distribution cadres is sufficient, but the quality is not high. Their professional ideas are not very solid, and it will take a considerable amount of time to train them. The specific methods are: ① Use the method of apprenticeship to train young people in their work by older professional workers; the editorial department recruits university graduates, and the publishing affairs and distribution departments recruit high school graduates, first conduct short-term basic training in business, and then train and gradually improve them to be able to work independently; special attention should be paid to training leading cadres with professional knowledge and good at political activities and academic activities. ② The publishing houses and distribution agencies set up their own short-term training classes to gather on-the-job cadres for rotation learning. To implement the above two methods, firstly, it is necessary to carry out ideological education for young people to study hard, secondly, to purchase sufficient books and materials for them to use, thirdly, to have a certain system of mentors, and fourthly, to not make the staffing too tight, so that teachers and students have time to teach and learn. ③ The state sets up publishing professional schools, or comprehensive universities set up publishing, editing, and book trade departments to train publishing, editing, and distribution professional cadres. ④ The state dispatches some science and literature experts to publishing houses to undertake editing and review work and provide professional discipline business guidance to on-the-job editorial cadres. ⑤ Contact senior experts from all walks of life, mainly senior librarians of cultural and historical museums, and send people to learn individually from them, learning their expertise in culture.

3. Sort out and reprint books to preserve ancient book woodblocks: China's cultural heritage is vast and boundless, and the state should carry out planned and systematic sorting and reprinting, and collect and preserve ancient book woodblocks. It is suggested that a special agency be established under the Science and Technology Planning Commission of the State Council, and experts from all over the country be invited to open lists of ancient books that should be sorted out, reprinted, and compiled (such as compilations of local chronicles) in their respective professions, and organize publishing houses to formulate long-term plans and gradually publish them. For ancient book woodblocks, the State Council should issue an order to the people's committees of all provinces and cities to conduct investigations, clean up, repair, and properly preserve them, and select valuable books to be printed in suitable places. In addition to the woodblocks stored in public institutions, the trend of private book engraving was very popular in the past, and some woodblocks are still preserved by private individuals. They should also be investigated and sorted out. Those who are willing to sell them should be purchased by the state at a price. Those who are willing to donate them should be accepted and rewarded by the state to encourage the sale or donation of privately-owned book woodblocks to the state (another proposal will be discussed in detail).

4. Develop and store handmade paper for printing ancient books: In recent years, the production of handmade paper has been low and the supply has been tight. In addition to objective reasons, the supply and marketing cooperatives do not include cultural paper in the supply plan, resulting in some places using handmade paper for other unnecessary purposes: such as the Nanjing Supply and Marketing Cooperative selling a large amount of "Mao Tai Paper" (used for repairing old books) for civilian use, and the Dinghu Mountain City Government in Guangdong using high-quality Mao Bian paper as "letter paper." At the same time, the purchase price is also unreasonable. Comparing 1956 with 1934, the price of machine-made newsprint is close to six times that of 1934, while the price of handmade Lian Shi paper has only increased by 2%, and the price of machine-made Lian Shi paper has increased by less than one and a half times. In fact, the price of handmade paper is only one-quarter of the price of machine-made newsprint. Therefore, there is no profit to be made from handmade paper, and it may even lose money, so production has decreased. It is suggested that: ① Appropriately change the current unified purchase and supply method, and allow the state to directly contact some handmade paper workshops with better paper quality, organize their production, purchase and supply, or the Ministry of Culture should uniformly purchase and supply various publishing houses. ② The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Light Industry should unify the specifications for publishing handmade paper, increase the purchase price, and conduct in-depth investigations into the production technology of high-quality domestic paper in the past, continue to promote it, and ask relevant departments to provide help and solutions for raw material difficulties, and improve operating techniques and try to produce new products to continue to improve the quality of handmade paper. ③ The production process of handmade paper is relatively slow and seasonal, and it cannot be supplied to publishing houses in a balanced manner. It is suggested that the Ministry of Culture can purchase a batch of handmade paper as a national reserve, and at the same time allow publishing houses to properly store handmade paper for use in printing large-scale ancient books when temporary purchases are not available. ④ The paper mills in Shanghai that produced machine-made Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper in the past with better quality, should be assigned a certain amount of machine-made Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper tasks every year.

5. Establish a national editing department to edit the Chinese Encyclopedia: China's socialist cause is developing day by day, and the cultural cause must follow suit. It is recommended that a national translation and compilation agency be established under the leadership of the Science and Technology Planning Commission of the State Council, organize experts, establish a translation and compilation committee, and plan and edit the Chinese Encyclopedia separately, and complete and publish it within a certain period of time (the Soviet Union established the Great Soviet Encyclopedia Editorial Office in 1923, and the publication time of the first edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia lasted for 32 years; in 1948, the Central Committee decided to newly establish the Main Editorial Office of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and by 1956, 43 volumes had been published in the second edition. And a Great Soviet Encyclopedia Publishing House directly under the editorial department was set up, and the president was led by the editor-in-chief). The editing and printing of the encyclopedia is a huge project, which takes a considerable amount of time to complete, and also requires a lot of experts from all fields. Now the country has the conditions to make long-term plans in culture, and both domestic and international demand "Chinese Encyclopedia", so it is suggested that the Chinese Encyclopedia Editorial Department be included in the plan in the near future and gradually carried out.

6. Strengthen Key Leadership: After liberation, the publishing administrative departments have made great achievements in the socialist transformation and construction of the publishing industry. However, in specific leadership work, there is a bias towards business management and grasping specific numerical indicators. It is recommended that the focus of leadership be placed on: ① Political and ideological leadership, supervising publishing houses to implement the Party and state policies and guidelines; ② Planning and promoting national large-scale plans for the publishing industry, and constantly urging, inspecting, and helping various publishing houses to carry out their work; ③ Studying specific methods to improve the quality of various publications.

The above are my personal opinions on the current publishing industry. As for the contradictions between the publishing industry and various aspects of society, and the basic issues such as its nature and tasks, I will write a separate article on this and will not discuss it here.

From the past achievements, I firmly believe that the future publishing industry will have even greater and more brilliant achievements under the correct and strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government! Let the right-wing elements open their eyes and watch!

    关于目前出版事业的问题
    舒新城的发言
    我以出版工作者的身份，谈谈当前出版事业的问题。
    出版事业牵涉的面很广，矛盾很多，它的性质怎样，它的基本任务怎样，社会各方面以至出版工作者内部，都有不同的看法，因时间的限制暂且不谈，只谈一些具体的问题。
    一、出版事业的成绩
    从去年北京、上海各报指出书籍又缺又滥的问题，经过右派分子渲染以后，知识分子中有一个相当广泛的共同感觉：好像解放后的出版事业只有缺点没有成绩。事实上成绩仍然是主要的。我从改造、建设两方面略讲八年来出版事业的成就。
    中国人民自办的新式出版事业，以一八九七年（清光绪二十三年）的商务印书馆为始，六十年来，虽有大小出版社几百个，但除去少数的进步书店而外，最大多数的书店都在挂着“文化事业”的招牌下，实行同行倾轧，以至投机倒把。同时在过去半封建、半殖民地客观条件的限制下，不论在著作和出版方面都是先天不足，出版物不能满足人民的要求；而投机商人渗入其中，有许多有害的书籍反而推广到广大人民的手中。以前的出版社除极少数外，大部分都没有编辑人员。这些书店从一九四九年大陆解放后，社会经济基础改变，旧的经营方式不适用了，因而当时最大部分的出版社都无法自存。人民政府于一九五○年秋召开全国出版会议，同年十月政务院根据全国出版会议决定的“统筹兼顾、分工合作”的原则发出十项指示，由出版总署依据出版、发行、印刷分工，出版专业的方针，对旧出版业进行改造，对新华书店加强领导，对新出版社加速建设。
    从一九五○年全国出版会议以后，出版行政部门在出版方面使私营、公营进行专业分工，在发行方面则以新华书店为主，专任发行工作，使有条件出版的出版社能继续维持；对于那些无条件出版的出版社也统筹安排，把性质相近的合并，人员则全部包下，统一安排。一九五一年后，出版业即逐步走上有组织有计划的道路，全国正当的私营出版社，到一九五六年合并为公私合营出版社十九家，私营出版社已成为历史上的名词。因而适合于人民需要的书刊逐年加多，有害的出版物逐步绝迹；而通过新华书店的统一发行，书籍和邮局的代发报刊，书刊的发行量大大增加，全国任何边远地方的人民都可以在差不多相同的时期买到各出版社的出版物和报刊，而且不要多费一文“地区差价”。这是出版事业中改造的成绩。
    在建设方面，除国家机关的很多部门设立若干专业出版社，各地方也有出版社（全国总共一百零一家），八年来，不独各种专门书籍和地方性、通俗性的出版物逐年增加，书价逐年降低达百分之五十，就是质量也逐年有所提高。兹举一九五○到一九五六年与一九三六年（解放前出版物数字最高的一年）图书出版情况，以证我国在解放后出版事业的成绩。
    历年图书出版情况
    年别　种　数　册数（千册，千份）
    1936　9，438　178，000
    1950　12，153　274，633
    1951　18，300　703，304
    1952　13，970　788，744
    1953　18，384　754，519
    1954　19，177　939，962
    1955　22，538　1，079，574
    1956　30，196　1，786，435
    注：1、历年的种数均包括初版、重版图书的种数。
        2、一九五六年系初步统计数字。
        3、表列数字均包括教科书。
    从上列数字可以看出一九五六年我国的出书种数为一九三六年三倍多，册数为一九三六年的十倍多。一九五○年至一九五六年共出版马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作二百四十一种，二千七百余万册。现在的右派分子说共产党领导下的新中国的各种事业的缺点是主要的，我希望他们把上面的事实看看，再向自己打一个响亮的耳光！
    二、出版事业中的主要问题
    现在谈谈出版事业中的主要问题：
    ⒈缺书问题：去年秋季一部分通俗书曾有大量积压，各报纸记载不少，而且很多人归咎于新华书店的制度不善。但据我的了解，所谓“滥”，是与当时文化部领导上的冒进思想有很大的关系，不能专责新华书店。现在“滥”的问题已成过去，最主要的问题是“缺”。去年秋季以来，中学汉语文学分科，大多数的教师和学生连“唐诗三百首”那种旧日家塾读的书都买不到，也没有适合中小学生用的新的字典、词典。几年来大家要研究鲁迅，但“鲁迅全集”便很难买到。许多有价值的孤本、善本、遗著，更没有听说有计划地搜集印行。就是商务印书馆、中华书局过去编辑的辞源和辞海、印行的四部丛刊和四部备要，开明书店印行的二十五史等较大的出版工作，也没有听到有那些出版社在计划进行。而这类工作是出版事业中的重工业，非有十年八年的时间，很多的人力物力不能完成。现在若不急起直追，由出版社网罗人才、搜集资料、充实图书馆，作有计划的进行，等到“老成雕谢”、资料图书散失之后，要整理、校印古籍，也将无人去干、少书可据，对文化的损失是无可补偿的。缺书的另一原因，是发行部门分配图书不适当的问题。新华书店一套发行制度能使全国出版的书籍在短期内发行到全国各地区，它的组织是适合于社会主义建设的需要的。解放后，书籍的发行量比一九三六年超过十倍，是与新华书店的发行制度及其工作人员的努力分不开的。但因工作上的缺点，不能更好地掌握读者的需要，有许多学术研究上必需的参考书，送不到必需这些书的读者手里；同时专门书籍需要的数量不大，新华书店往往从营业观点着眼而不愿重版，以致有一些可以供应的图书也缺乏。
    ⒉出版物的原材料问题：目前有关出版的纸张、油墨、制版器材等都存在一些问题，但最主要的是国产手工纸的缺乏。现在略谈这个问题。
    抗战前，上海出版方面印古籍的线装书，需要连史、毛边、宣纸等手工纸很多，其来源是向福建、浙江、安徽、江西等省专造土纸的作坊订购，上海的造纸厂也造机制连史和机制毛边，不过其质量不如手工制的，容易风化变质。抗日战争开始，线装书大减，中式账簿和学生习字练习簿也不用或大量减少，因此手工纸大量减产。有些原来制造土纸的技工陆续改业，机制连史与毛边则已基本停止。最近一二年，因需要逐渐增加，手工纸渐有恢复，但生产出来的毛边纸较厚，不适合线装书之用；连史纸则因农村不易得到漂白粉，产量亦很有限。去年手工纸列为国家统一收购物资，由供销合作社统一收购、供应后，出版方面需要的手工纸的数量、质量均不能供应。今年上半年上海几家需用手工纸的出版社，曾派专人到福建、浙江等地，调查土纸生产情况，打算与手工业纸作坊建立联系，但因为供销社不负责供文化用纸，没有结果。商务印书馆、中华书局、古典文学出版社等要印古籍图书需用土纸，也只得到一部分。此后，书籍用手工纸出版的用纸量会越来越大。因此，这一问题不解决，对今后古籍出版工作是很有影响的。
    ⒊干部问题：我国有新式出版事业虽有六十年，但从来没有培养干部的专门组织，所有出版社工作者都是由知识分子在工作中摸索经验，所以旧社会遗留下来的出版专业尤其是编辑专业人员不多。到一九五六年为止，全国一百零一所出版社的工作人员，据不完全的统计，共约九千六百九十人，其中编辑人员约三千七百三十人（中央级出版社六千五百四十人，其中编辑人员二千六百八十人，地方级出版社三千一百五十人，编辑一千零五十人），出版社非编辑人员与编辑的比例，约为三比一（上海为五比一）。从这个数字可以看出编辑人员的缺乏，非编辑人员的比例过大。这种非生产与生产人员的比率是不合社会主义文化事业的经营方式，也说明编辑干部有加紧培养的必要。
    因为出版工作者历来都是由于知识分子自己干起来的，因而社会中一部分人便以为出版工作是一切知识分子可以干得了的，所以不重视培养。实则一个大学毕业生，经过短期的专业训练可以教书或作科学研究工作，但却很难在出版社担任编辑。现在编辑工作者虽有三千余人，但能独立工作者不足五分之一，而关于中国古籍之专业编辑尤少。出版事务工作人员虽多，但质量一般还不及编辑人员。新华书店有分支店、门市部、书店三千四百五十处，职工三万三千九百九十九人，但文化水平一般为高小毕业程度，小部分为中学毕业程度，大学程度者很少，大学毕业生尤少。
  目前出版和发行中的一些缺点，除去客观形势及领导上教条主义的清规戒律原因而外，编辑、出版、发行干部的质量不高也是重大原因。我国经济建设日趋繁荣，人民对文化生活的要求必日益增长，现在的编辑、出版、发行干部在质量上固要提高，在数量上也要增加。国家实有及早订立长期培养计划之必要。
    ⒋组织领导问题：一九五○年十月二十八日政务院发布“关于改进和发展全国出版事业”的十项指示，其中有一项要国家行政部门和地方及人民团体尽可能设出版社或编辑部，同时从人民出版社起，各出版社的内部组织把中国旧出版业中一些可以采用的技术和经验也最大部分摒弃不用。对于中国在出版工作中的物质条件如文字结构、排字铸字方法的特点，和中国出版业在目前生产力水平下应如何组织、管理方能保证出版生产、发挥其最大力量的诸问题，以及中国只有十万高级知识分子（苏联有中等以上专家六百万人），能负担多少出版社的稿源诸问题都考虑不够周到。一九五一年后，中央国家机关的许多部门以及地方与团体很多有专业出版社的组织。但发展不平衡，如建筑部门有建筑工程出版社、建筑材料工业出版社，而无农业出版社。领导也很分歧：各专业部门的出版社由各专业的国家机构领导，音乐出版社、青年出版社等由中国音乐家协会及中国共产主义青年团中央委员会等领导；地方出版社由各地方行政机关领导。
    文化部的出版事业管理局虽然统管中央一级出版社的业务，但对直属人民政府各部门和人民团体的出版社则只管理它们的出版计划和出版制度，编辑业务、选题计划、干部等则由它们的直接上级领导机关管理。因而在分工上往往发生各出版社一面拉稿、一面有稿无出版社出版的现象；出版社的行政组织和干部也有许多浪费的地方。这是组织领导问题的一方面。
    其次是出版行政部门的领导思想问题。解放后，出版行政部门对出版事业改造和建设有很大的成就，前面已经讲过。但领导者对于出版事业的本质和特性重视不够，把握不足，在思想上有把出版事业看作单纯的企业的倾向。他们对出版社的管理。虽然有监督出版社贯彻党和国家的方针任务和提高出版物质量的规定，但实际上则经常抓出版社的出版字数、种数、册数、用纸、定价等数字指标，对发行部门每年按比例增加任务，于是出版社为要完成数字指标的任务，有时便不能不脱离读者的需要出书，更不敢定长远计划，编印大部书，只专心致志于“一年生草”的小册子；发行部门有时为要完成销售数字任务，便不得不利用摊派方法以完成任务。其次，出版是一种阶级斗争的工具，是一种学术性的企业，它的企业经营的任务只有在贯彻国家文教政策、满足读者要求的条件下完成方有意义，利润的上缴不应列作主要的目的。一九五六年上海人民出版社上缴利润二百零九万元，上海人民美术出版社上缴二百六十五万元，两社共缴四百九十四万元。而真正工业部门的第一工业局只缴三百六十万元。由此可见出版干部的培养、图书资料的充实、大部书籍的编印在出版部门内部的经济上是有条件的。又其次在编辑工作方面，一九五二年七月由出版总署规定编辑工作制度，过于强调了三审制和对书稿的政治责任，使编辑与作者难于见面，更难讲作朋友。对编辑一面要他们审阅专家的书稿，担任出版物的一切错误的责任，而待遇却远不能与他们的工作相称。如上海人民出版社出过不少专门书籍，但至今却没有一个高级知识分子的待遇。此外，一九五○年后不曾再开过一次全国出版会议，也没有出版工作者自己的组织。这是组织领导问题的又一方面。
    ⒌木刻书版问题：我国木刻书版创始于五代，现在尚有唐咸通刊行的金刚经，是公元九世纪留下来的一件艺术品，宋、元、明、清各代的精本刊，开卷时好像有一股精气迎人而来。它们不仅保存了祖国的许多文化遗产，也保存了许多雕刻的艺术。我们现在若不重视这些书版，时间稍长，这些书版将因霉烂、蛀蚀而逐渐消亡，将来后悔也来不及。
    古籍出版社曾经聘请专家，到杭州、南浔、苏州、广州、武昌、南京等地调查木版情形，已看过木版约五十万块，其中有很多难得的版本，如存在常州的“蒙兀儿史记”，存在扬州的“汉学堂丛书”等。据报告：各地的书版一般是由当地文化局存放在破旧的房屋里，谨守钥匙，防止偷盗，但是否因潮湿或虫蛀而损坏则不过问。至于清理，他们以为第一没有空的房屋，第二没有经费；在人力方面还不是主要的困难，因为各地方的文史馆员都愿自告奋勇（广州文史馆经过去年的大量发展，馆员年岁有三十岁左右的，他们有无事可干的苦闷）。有些地方则以领导上重视不够，对书版问题的处理不当，如广州存放书版的房屋，有四位干部及家属二十余人住在里面，书版难保没有损毁；南京官书局的书版则全部失踪；前中南行政区文教部曾对中南区各地现存的书版，作过一次调查统计，但现在连档案也找不着。盛宣怀家藏的“常州先哲遗书续集”及“愚斋存稿”的两种书版，一九五二年九、十月间，由上海房管局接收盛苹臣家具的时候，把书版连架一百零八只和愚斋的公文稿件数十箱拿去，当时有一部分送拍卖行拍卖，一部分放房管局仓库，以后不知下文。也有少数私家藏版要出卖，但无人收购，也有人愿意将书版捐献，但找不到接受捐献的机关。
    以上只是报告的一部分。由此也可说明我国重要文化遗产之一的木雕书版是处在“存亡之秋”的紧要关头。国家需要赶快作有计划的抢救。
    三、几项建议
    ⒈召开全国出版会议解决与各方面有关的问题：出版事业牵涉的面很广，除作者、读者和出版、编辑、印刷、发行各方面的关系外，还要牵涉到纸张、油墨、照像器材、五金用品、机器制造等等方面的问题。出版业务虽由文化部管理，编辑、选题等计划由专业部门领导，但文化部和各专业部门不能完全解决出版中各方面的问题，尤其是解决不了手工纸、外贸的问题，更不能解决社会对出版事业的认识问题。因此，建议文化部先把去年各报纸及今年各地宣传会议和整风运动所揭露出来关于出版问题的资料，整理成若干问题，再邀请有关方面的人员讨论，总结出一些主要问题后定期召开一次全国出版会议。参加会议的除与出版业务有关的出版、编辑、印刷、发行（包括邮局）等人员外，并要请各类作者、各类读者（可以各类图书馆的工作人员为读者的主要代表）和有关部门如轻工业部、外贸部、供销合作社等参加。在这个会议中要解决一些问题，我的初步意见：①确定今后出版事业的方针任务。②取得大家对于出版事业性质及其基本任务的大致相同的认识。③解决出版、发行、印刷之间的主要矛盾，如出版与发行对于书籍印数的决定权与双方的经济责任关系，印刷如何改进质量，更好地为出版服务。④各部门各地方的出版社应否统筹调整，如何调整。⑤体制如何调整，旧中国的出版经验如何总结利用（现在很有人主张恢复以前商务印书馆等出版、印刷、发行的“三位一体”制，我以为某些有特殊条件或有特殊需要的出版社如中华书局有印刷厂，科学出版社需要专业印刷厂，可以自设印刷厂，邮电出版社有条件在邮电局设发行所外，要把旧日的“三位一体”制当作出版社的制度，在今天讲是不合时宜的：因为新华书店的发行制度已能供应全国，如出版社要单独搞一套发行组织，必需另设一套运输、仓库和管理制度，实在是最大的浪费，而效果可以断定不如新华；印刷厂是机械的工业，机器经常需要有一定的任务，而出版书籍为脑力工作，绝难像机器一般地安排工作，出版社有了印刷所，便得天天为它奔走印件，无特殊需要或有特殊条件者不必设印刷厂，多耗国家资金。所以我不主张恢复旧的出版体制）。⑥作者与出版社的关系及其相互责任，尤其是久悬不决的稿酬问题。⑦发行工作如何改进，使各项书刊能更及时地达到需要的读者手里。⑧出版工作者应否有其自己的组织、如何组织，使大家能利用这种组织加强学习，提高政治与业务水平。⑨干部培养办法。⑩其他。这个会议应当尽速举行，因为出版界的问题多而必须解决，但必须有充分的准备，不可为赶快而草率从事，开了等于不开。
    ⒉利用各种方法培养干部：现在编辑干部数量质量均不高，出版事务与发行干部量够而质不高，专业思想都不很巩固，培养起来需要相当长的时间。具体的办法：①用带徒弟的办法由老年专业工作者在工作中培养青年；编辑部门招收大学毕业生，出版事务及发行部门招收高中毕业生，先进行短期的业务上的基本训练，再在工作中锻炼、逐步提高到能独立工作为止；尤其要注意培养有专业知识和长于政治活动、学术活动的领导干部。②由出版社及发行机关自设短期训练班，调集在职干部轮流学习。实行以上两种办法，首先要对青年进行艰苦自学的思想教育，其次要购备充分的图书资料供他们使用，第三要有一定的导师指导制度，第四编制不要过紧，使教者学者有时间教导和学习。③由国家设出版专业学校，或由综合大学设出版、编辑、图书贸易系，培养出版、编辑、发行专业干部。④由国家调派一部分科学、文艺专家到出版社负担编审工作，对在职编辑干部进行专业学科的业务辅导。⑤联络社会各方面的老年专家，主要是文史馆老年馆员，派人个别从师，学其在文化上的专长。
    ⒊整理重印书籍保存古书木版：我国文化遗产浩如烟海，要由国家为有计划、有系统的整理、重印，并将古书木版收集保存。建议在国务院科学规划委员会之下设专设机构，约集全国专家各就其专业开具应整理、应翻印、辑印（如地方志汇编）的古籍书目，组织出版社制定长期计划，逐步印行。对于古书木版由国务院通令各省市人民委员会进行调查、清理、整补，善为保存，并择有价值的书籍在适宜的地方印刷。除公共机关所存的木版外，以前私人刻书的风气很盛，有若干书版尚由私人保藏，也要调查整理，如愿出售者，国家备价收购，有自愿捐献者，国家应接受并予奖励，鼓励私藏书版出售或捐献于国家（另有提案详说）。
    ⒋发展储备手工纸供印行古书之用：近年来手工纸生产少、供应紧张，除去客观的原因外，供销社不把文化用纸列入供应计划之内，以致有些地方以手工纸作他项不必要的用途：如南京供销合作社将“毛太纸”（补旧书用的）大量出售作民间用纸，广东鼎湖山市府用上等毛边纸作“便纸”。同时收购价格也不合理，以一九五六年和一九三四年比较，机制新闻纸的价格接近一九三四年的六倍，手工连史纸只增加百分之二，机制连史纸增加一倍半不到。实际上手工纸的价格仅及机制新闻纸价格的四分之一。因而手工纸无利可图，甚至要亏本，所以生产减少。建议：①适当改变目前的统一收购的供应办法，由国家允许将一部分纸质较好的手工纸作坊由出版社直接联系，组织其生产，收购供应，或由文化部统一收购供应各出版社。②由文化部、轻工业部对出版手工用纸统一规格，提高收购价格，并深入调查历来国产优质纸的生产技术，继续发扬，原料有困难的请有关部门给予帮助、解决，并改进操作技术，试制新产品，继续提高手工纸质量。③手工纸的生产过程比较迟缓，且有季节性，不能平衡供应出版社使用。建议文化部能收购一批手工纸作为国家储备，同时允许出版社适当储备手工纸，以供印制规模巨大的古籍因临时采购不到的使用。④上海过去生产机制连史纸毛边纸的质量较好的造纸厂，每年分配一定数量的机制连史纸毛边纸的任务。
    ⒌设立国家编辑部门编辑中国百科全书：我国社会主义事业日益发展，文化事业必须跟着发展。建议由国务院科学规划委员会领导设立国家编译机关，组织专家，成立编译委员会，分别计划、编辑中国百科全书，在一定的时期内完成、出版（苏联于一九二三年即成立大百科全书编辑室，苏联百科全书第一版出版时间前后达三十二年；一九四八年由中央决定新成立大百科全书总编辑部，到一九五六年，第二版出过四十三卷。并在编辑部下设一个直属的大百科全书出版社，社长受总编辑室领导）。百科全书的编印工程浩大，需要相当长的时间方能完成，而且需要各方面专家的力量很大。现在国家有条件在文化上作长期的打算，国内和国际也都要求“中国百科全书”，故建议在最近期间把中国百科全书编辑部列入规划之中，逐步进行。
    ⒍加强重点领导：解放后出版行政部门对于出版事业的社会主义改造与建设上，有很大的成就。但在具体领导工作上有偏重于业务经营及抓具体数字指标的情形。建议今后把领导重点放在：①政治思想领导，监督出版社对于党和国家政策方针的贯彻；②计划推进出版事业全国性的大规划，经常督促、检查、帮助各出版社进行工作；③研究具体办法提高各种出版物的质量。
    以上是个人对于目前出版事业的意见。至于出版事业与社会各方面的矛盾及其性质和任务等基本问题，将另写专文，这里不谈了。
    从以往的成绩，我深信今后的出版事业在中国共产党和人民政府正确、坚强的领导下，将有更大的辉煌的成就！右派分子且睁眼看着吧！
