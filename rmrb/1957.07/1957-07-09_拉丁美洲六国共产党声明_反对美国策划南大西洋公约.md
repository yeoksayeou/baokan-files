    新华社8日讯　据乌拉圭“人民报”报道，阿根廷、玻利维亚、智利、巴西、巴拉圭和乌拉圭六国共产党发表声明，反对南大西洋公约。
    声明强调指出，南大西洋公约是“美国用来诱惑我们这些国家去实现它的侵略战争政策的那种同盟和协定锁链中的又一环节。”
    声明号召一切渴望和平、自由和独立的人们起来斗争，反对建立侵略性军事集团，反对美国在别国领土上建立军事基地，争取停止试验原子武器和禁止原子武器，争取签订裁军协定，争取建立集体安全体系，争取同世界各国，特别是同社会主义国家发展和平合作。
    今年5月中旬到5月底，阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭和巴拉圭四国军事代表曾经举行过一次预备性的会议，讨论建立美国策划的南大西洋军事集团问题。
