Our country's electrical machinery manufacturing industry has become an independent, modernized industry.
This year's national planned total output value is equivalent to forty times that of 1949.
Speech by Chu Ying-huang

I fully agree with and sincerely support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and other reports.

Recently, bourgeois right-wing elements, taking advantage of the Party's proposal to correctly handle contradictions among the people and launch the rectification movement, launched a frenzied attack on the socialist cause of our people. They are hostile to the socialist cause and deliberately obliterate the brilliant achievements of the Party's leadership of the people over the past few years. They describe the tremendous achievements of socialist transformation and socialist construction that our people have already achieved as "the Five-Year Plan has gone bankrupt" and "China's industrialization has been messed up." They attempted to use the vicious method of negating achievements and exaggerating shortcomings to depict the new China under the leadership of the working class as pitch black, and frantically launched malicious attacks on the Party. They, in an organized, planned, and strategically deployed manner, from words to actions, vainly attempted to usurp the leadership of the Party; to transform our country from a socialist country led by the working class into a capitalist country under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and then to oppress and exploit our working people again. Their words and actions are anti-Party and anti-socialist, and violate the Constitution. The people of the whole country must unite and actively and deeply engage in the struggle to counterattack these bourgeois right-wing elements.

As a scientific and technical worker in the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, I am extremely excited to see that since liberation, our country's electrical machinery manufacturing industry has developed from a repair-based industry into an independent, modernized industry. Now I will briefly talk about the achievements in production technology development of the electrical machinery manufacturing industry in the past few years, and use ironclad facts to refute the fallacy of bourgeois right-wing elements clamoring that "China's industrialization has been messed up."

This year, the planned total output value of the national electrical machinery manufacturing industry will be 2.9 times that of 1952, equivalent to 40 times that of 1949. Before liberation, although China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry had more than 30 years of history, its foundation was very weak. The vast majority were small repair-based factories with simple equipment, small product capacity, chaotic types, and inconsistent technical standards. Before liberation, the largest generator produced was less than 200 kilowatts, the largest motor was less than 300 horsepower, and the transformer was only 2,000 kilovolt-amperes; the voltage of high-voltage electrical appliances was rarely higher than 10,000 volts, and many power equipment such as hydro-turbine generator sets, power cables, and lightning arresters could not be manufactured. Before liberation, China's medium-sized power stations and metallurgical mining equipment, including electrical equipment, completely relied on foreign imports. In short, old China did not have a truly independent electrical machinery manufacturing industry.

The construction of the First Five-Year Plan greatly changed the face of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry. The Party led the planning and construction and expansion of 12 electrical machinery manufacturing factories, including new enterprises such as wire and cable factories, power capacitor factories, electrical instrument factories, and brush factories that were fully designed and equipped with Soviet assistance. Their technologies are all first-rate. There are also large-scale hydro-turbine power equipment factories, transformer factories, turbo-generator workshops, high-voltage switch factories, and low-voltage switch factories designed and built by China under the guidance of Soviet and Czech experts. They basically adopted new technical equipment. Except for a few, the newly built and expanded factories have been put into production. There are currently seven modern electrical machinery manufacturing factories under construction or expansion.

In December 1952, the Party correctly proposed and implemented the technical development policy of "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promoting Soviet technical standards," and organized all engineering and technical personnel in state-owned enterprises to combine ideological remolding, criticize pro-American views, and comprehensively carry out the learning of advanced technology in the Soviet electrical machinery manufacturing industry. With the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, referring to the technical data and physical products provided by the Soviet Union, imitation was carried out. Within five years, more than 2,500 new products of Soviet-style models were successfully trial-produced in more than 30 state-owned enterprises, unifying the types and technical standards of electrical products nationwide, and mastering a series of advanced methods for electrical product design and advanced processes for electrical manufacturing.

Today, China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry has successfully manufactured 15,000-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator sets, 12,000-kilowatt turbo-generators, 40,500-kilovolt-ampere transformers, 110,000-volt high-voltage circuit breakers, 35,000-volt power cables, kilowatt-hour meters, and automatic recording electricity meters, etc. China's motor and low-voltage switch factories can now fully produce direct current motors below 6,250 horsepower and complete sets of automatic control electrical equipment on which large-scale metallurgical mining equipment relies.

New products that will be trial-produced and prepared for trial production this year include 72,500-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator sets (including automation), 25,000-kilowatt turbo-generators, 220,000-volt, 20,000-kilovolt-ampere power transformers, 80-ton industrial and mining electric locomotives, complete sets of electrical transmission equipment for 700 mm rolling mills, and automatic submerged arc welding equipment, etc. It can be affirmed that by the end of 1957, the technical capabilities of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry will be able to fully manufacture medium-sized hydroelectric power stations, medium-sized thermal power stations, 110,000-volt high-voltage power grids (excluding 110,000-volt high-voltage power cables), and power equipment for large-scale metallurgical mining and metal processing enterprises.

China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry has basically been established in just seven years. The scale of development and the improvement of technical level in the past year far exceed the achievements of the old China in more than 30 years. This is an unprecedented miracle. This is a miracle created by the hard work of all electrical machinery manufacturing workers and engineering and technical personnel under the correct leadership of the Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This powerfully proves that only the Party can lead China's engineering technology. The vast number of engineering and technical personnel in the electrical machinery manufacturing sector have been trusted by the Party and the vast majority have been arranged in appropriate jobs, with responsibilities and authority, and are playing their role. Intellectuals engaged in the electrical machinery manufacturing industry realize from their own experience that only under the leadership of the Party can the industrial construction of the motherland develop forward at such a high speed, and our knowledge and experience can have the opportunity to make certain contributions and be further enriched in practice. Seeing the above brilliant achievements, we are even more confident to move forward along the socialist road.

The great achievements made by China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry in the First Five-Year Plan are inseparable from the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union. Many modern electrical machinery manufacturing factories newly built or expanded during the First Five-Year Plan have received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in everything from surveying, design, construction, equipment supply to mastering production. The Soviet government sent a large number of experts to guide us in various stages of work, accelerating the construction of China's electrical machinery industry. Bourgeois right-wing elements attempt to obliterate the sincere assistance of the Soviet government and people to our country, maliciously provoke the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and undermine international solidarity, thereby undermining China's socialist construction. We must resolutely refute them.

In the past few years, the achievements in various aspects of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry have been great, and the achievements are the main ones.

Now, please allow me to offer some opinions on the technical development of the electrical machinery manufacturing industry.

(1) Accelerate the construction of backbone enterprises in China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry to ensure the balanced improvement of the technical level of power equipment.

The electrical machinery manufacturing industry is the industry that provides equipment for national electrification, and it must first ensure the needs of power system development. The main material basis of the power system is power generation equipment and high-voltage power equipment that constitutes the high-voltage power grid—power transformers, high-voltage circuit breakers, high-voltage power cables, high-voltage porcelain insulators, lightning arresters, etc., collectively referred to as power equipment. The technical development of power equipment requires the early production of large hydro-turbine generator sets and turbo-generators with a unit capacity of 100,000 kilowatts and above, and high-voltage power equipment of 220,000 volts and above. From the perspective of the future development of China's power industry, its main body should be the construction of relatively large-scale hydroelectric power stations, thermal power stations, and large-scale power grids; only in this way can the construction speed of the power industry be guaranteed. Therefore, mastering the production technology of the above-mentioned large-scale power equipment is the main key to ensuring the huge development of China's power industry. The problem is that a group of backbone enterprises that can manufacture these huge power equipment must be built first, and it will take several years to master the complex and difficult technology of manufacturing these equipment.

The enterprises that the electrical machinery manufacturing department has already built and is building during the First Five-Year Plan only include a part of the above-mentioned backbone enterprises. The projects that should be added during the Second Five-Year Plan include: a giant transformer factory that can produce 100,000 to 200,000 kilovolt-amperes, a high-voltage all-aluminum power cable factory, etc. These types of enterprises must be built early.

The types of power equipment are complex, and the technology is still developing. In order to quickly master and develop the theory of large-scale power equipment and comprehensive advanced production experience, a large amount of scientific research work is needed. High-voltage engineering and high-current experimental stations are an integral part of the production base of high-voltage power equipment. Using it to carry out experimental research work can ensure the technical reliability of high-voltage power equipment and further improve the technical level. Today we are still blank. The Soviet Union has more than 30 years of history in scientific research on high-voltage engineering and high current, and has achieved great achievements; the 20th Congress of the CPSU also emphasized in its instructions on the Sixth Five-Year Plan that "organize scientific research work experimental stations to trial-produce AC electrical equipment with a voltage of 400 kilovolts and above." The Soviet Party and government's emphasis on scientific research on high-voltage power equipment is worthy of our learning. Now some people advocate postponing the construction of the high-voltage high-current experimental station designed and completed with Soviet assistance. This view is extremely incorrect and will seriously hinder the development of high-voltage power equipment manufacturing.

We believe that the electrical machinery manufacturing industry must build a complete set of backbone enterprises that can comprehensively undertake the production of large-scale power generation equipment and high-voltage power equipment during the Second Five-Year Plan, and strive to complete it during the Second Five-Year Plan, so as to ensure that it can comprehensively supply the equipment needed for the construction of large-scale power systems during the Third Five-Year Plan. It is recommended that the State Planning Commission consider quickly building high-voltage engineering high-current experimental stations, accelerating the construction of the Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Factory and High-Voltage Porcelain Factory, and designing and building giant transformer factories and high-voltage cable factories in advance. If the state has difficulties in investing in transformer and cable factories, it can consider building them in stages: first ensure the completion of the main production workshop and testing equipment, and adopt the method of cooperation between new and old enterprises to master the production technology of high-voltage power equipment in advance. Taking the above measures, it will still be necessary to wait until the middle of the Third Five-Year Plan before it is possible to comprehensively supply large-scale power equipment.

(2) Organize forces to conduct comprehensive planning for the technical development of power equipment.

In the past few years, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, comprehensively adopted the basic technical standards of the Soviet Union, and imitated a large number of Soviet-style specifications of power equipment to serve the construction of the power industry. However, due to our lack of experience and the relatively urgent objective needs, the scientific research work of the electrical industry department has not had time to cooperate in a timely manner. Therefore, in our learning of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have learned more by rote and not enough in combination with China's specific conditions. Since 1955, the scientific research institutions and related factories of power stations and electrical machinery manufacturing in the Soviet Union have jointly carried out a large amount of scientific research work, and have continuously developed new types of power equipment; the insulation level of high-voltage power equipment has been reduced, the weight of most products has been reduced, and the technical and economic indicators have been improved. The original electrical technical standards are also being revised. This is in line with the new trend in the development of world electrical technology. Faced with such new situations, the problems of type selection and design of power equipment in our country and the formulation of technical standards have become prominent contradictions. I believe that the technical development policy of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry should be based on seriously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and also absorb all countries' experiences that are beneficial to us, and develop new products that are suitable for China's use and manufacturing conditions in combination with China's specific conditions. China's resource and environmental conditions have many characteristics: for example, the topographic conditions of China's hydropower resources are favorable, and the water heads of hydropower stations under exploration and planning are relatively high, and the water volume is large, so it is possible to install units with smaller volume and larger unit capacity; also, China's southern region is located in the subtropical region, with high air temperature, high rainfall, and high humidity, as well as mold and insects that corrode electrical materials. It is precisely because of these characteristics that the structural design and technical standards of China's power equipment should not completely copy the ready-made experience of the Soviet Union or other countries.

I believe that the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing should quickly establish a scientific research base, transfer product design forces and experimental research forces, learn to master the latest technical achievements of the Soviet Union, combine with China's actual situation, carry out scientific research work, and move towards independent design. In order to coordinate the unity of needs and possibilities in the new situation, it is recommended that the Ministry of Power Industry and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing jointly formulate a ten-year long-term technical development plan for China's power system and a corresponding technical development plan for power equipment under the leadership of the National Technology Commission; urge both parties to work closely together in product type selection and the formulation of technical standards, and in scientific research work.

(3) On the supply of new electrical materials

The decisive key to the technological progress of the electrical machinery manufacturing industry depends on the technical level of electrical materials. The use of new electrical materials can greatly reduce the weight, volume, and extend the life of power machines. The use of high-permeability cold-rolled silicon steel sheets for large transformers can reduce the total weight by more than 30% and reduce the volume. This is a major key to the technological development of large transformers; the use of silicone organic insulating varnish and glass fiber and other new heat-resistant insulating materials for generators and motors can increase the output by more than 30% with the same weight and volume, and extend the life by several times; advanced insulating paper is the key insulating material for manufacturing ultra-high voltage power transformers and power capacitors. Solving the supply problem of the above-mentioned major new types of electrical materials can guide the electrical machinery manufacturing industry to accelerate technological progress and move towards greater savings. China's metallurgical, chemical, and paper industries have been too slow in the scientific research and production arrangements for the above-mentioned new types of electrical materials, especially the scientific research work on cold-rolled silicon steel sheets has not yet started, and the scientific research work on insulating paper also lacks deployment. It is understood that the Soviet electrical machinery manufacturing industry, due to the failure to obtain a sufficient supply of cold-rolled silicon steel sheets and silicone organic insulators in time, has resulted in the technical and economic indicators of certain power equipment being behind the world level. This should arouse our attention. It is recommended that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry build and renovate a factory specializing in the production of cold-rolled silicon steel sheets at the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, and start to supply high-permeability cold-rolled silicon steel sheets in rolls in large quantities in 1960; the Ministry of Chemical Industry should build an intermediate factory for manufacturing silicone organic insulators and start to supply them in batches in 1959; the metallurgical, chemical, and paper industry departments should immediately strengthen scientific research work on related electrical materials.

(4) On the complete supply of electrical equipment.

Everyone is concerned about the complete supply of electrical equipment, especially how to ensure timely complete delivery and not delay basic construction when large-scale metallurgical equipment or substations involve complex electrical systems. During the First Five-Year Plan, large-scale complete sets of equipment in industrial basic construction basically relied on Soviet supply, so the above problems were not prominent. In the future, we should use our own manufactured equipment, and we must solve the corresponding complete supply problem of electrical equipment, thereby accelerating the speed of China's industrial basic construction.

The design work of electrical systems is complex. On the one hand, the design unit must use the new achievements of scientific research to guide the design, and on the other hand, it must combine with China's production reality and put forward requirements. The complete supply of electrical equipment is a very complex organizational work, because it involves the cooperation of many factories, especially when certain major new products are encountered in the electrical system that need to be trial-produced, it will affect the time of complete supply. It is generally estimated that it often takes more than a year from system design to organizing complete supply. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Power Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgy, etc. start to formulate long-term demand plans for related large-scale equipment and corresponding complete sets of electrical equipment, and put forward and determine the complete sets of equipment needed in a few years in advance, so as to facilitate the manufacturing department to organize complete design, trial production and production arrangements in advance. This is an important condition for solving the problem of China manufacturing its own large-scale machinery equipment and corresponding complete sets of electrical equipment. I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to it.

The above opinions are put forward for the reference of the representatives and please give criticism and corrections.

Finally, I fully agree with and resolutely abide by the oath of President Guo Moruo on behalf of Chinese scientists: "Our Chinese scientists must adhere to the ideological remolding of voluntary and conscious for a long time, and further improve their political and ideological level in the resolute struggle against right-wing elements, and unite more closely around the Party and the government, and continue to move forward along the socialist road."

    我国电机制造业已成为独立的近代化的工业
    今年全国的计划总产值相当于一九四九年的四十倍
    褚应璜的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。
    最近一个时期，资产阶级右派分子，利用党提出正确处理人民内部矛盾和开展整风运动的机会，发动了对我国人民的社会主义事业的猖狂进攻，他们敌视社会主义事业，故意抹煞党领导全国人民几年来辛勤劳动的辉煌成果，把我国人民已经取得的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的巨大成就说成“五年计划破产了”，“中国的工业化搞糟了”。他们企图用否定成绩夸大缺点的恶毒手法，把工人阶级领导下的新中国描写成漆黑一团，猖狂地向党进行恶意的攻击，他们有组织、有计划、有部署、有策略地从言论到行动，妄想篡夺党的领导；把我国从工人阶级领导的社会主义国家变成资产阶级专政的资本主义国家，再来压迫剥削我们劳动人民。他们的言论和行动是反党反社会主义的，是违反宪法的，全国人民必须一致起来，积极地、深入地投入反击这些资产阶级右派分子的斗争。
    作为一个电机制造工业的科学技术工作者，看到解放以来我国电机制造工业从修配式的工业发展成为独立的近代化的工业，感到无比兴奋。现在我简单地讲一讲电机制造工业几年来生产技术发展的成就，用铁一般的事实来驳斥资产阶级右派分子叫嚣“中国的工业化搞糟了”的谬论。
    今年全国电机制造工业的计划总产值将为一九五二年的二点九倍，相当于一九四九年的四十倍。旧中国的电机制造工业直到解放前虽然已经有三十多年的历史，但基础十分薄弱，极大多数是修配式的小工厂，设备简陋，产品容量小，型式混乱，技术标准不统一。解放前生产过的发电机，最大不到二百瓩，电动机最大不到三百马力，变压器不过二千千伏安；高压电器的电压很少高出一万伏，很多电力装备如水轮发电机组、电力电缆、避雷器等都不能制造。旧中国的中型电站和冶金采矿装备包括电气设备，完全依靠外国进口。总括一句，旧中国没有真正独立的电机制造工业。
    第一个五年计划的建设，大大地改变了我国电机制造工业的面貌。党领导规划并且新建和扩建完成十二个电机制造工厂，其中有苏联全面帮助设计并装备起来的电线电缆厂，电力电容器厂，电工仪表厂和电刷厂等全新企业，它们的技术都是头等的；也有在苏联和捷克专家指导下由我国自行设计建设的大型水轮发电设备厂，变压器厂，汽轮发电机车间，高压开关厂，低压开关厂等，它们基本上都采用了新的技术装备。新建和扩建工厂除个别外都已经投入生产。目前正在建设中的新建和扩建的现代化电机制造工厂有七个。
    一九五二年十二月，党正确地提出了并且贯彻执行了“学习苏联先进经验，推行苏联技术标准”的技术发展方针，组织国营企业内全体工程技术人员，结合思想改造，批判崇美观点，全面开展学习苏联电机制造工业的先进技术。在苏联专家的无私帮助下，参考苏联供给的技术资料和实物产品，进行仿制。五年之内，先后在三十多个国营企业中试制成功仿苏型式的新产品二千五百多种，统一了全国电器产品的型式与技术标准，掌握了一系列的电机产品设计的先进方法和电机制造的先进工艺。
    今天，我国电机制造工业已经制造成功一万五千瓩的水轮发电机组，一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机，四万零五百千伏安的变压器，十一万伏的高压断路器，三万五千伏的电力电缆，瓩时计及自动记录电表等。我国的电动机和低压开关工厂现在能够全面生产大型冶金采矿装备所赖以运转的六千二百五十马力以下的直流电动机和自动控制的全套电气设备。
    今年开始试制和准备试制的新产品有七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机组（包括自动化部分），二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，二十二万伏、二万千伏安的电力变压器，八十吨工矿电机车，七百公厘轧钢机的成套电气传动设备和自动化熔渣电焊设备等。可以肯定，到一九五七年底，我国电机制造工业的技术能力，就能够全面地自己制造中型水力发电站、中型火电发电站、十一万伏的高压电力网（不包括十一万伏的高压电力电缆）以及大型冶金采矿与金属加工企业的电力装备了。
    我国电机制造工业在短短七年内已经基本上建立起来了。一年来的发展规模和技术水平的提高，远远超过旧中国三十多年来的成就，这是史无前例的奇迹。这是在党的正确领导下，在苏联的无私帮助下，全体电机制造工人和工程技术人员辛勤劳动创造的奇迹，显示了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。这有力地证明了只有党才能够领导我国的工程技术。在电机制造部门的广大工程技术人员，得到党的信任而且极大多数安排在适当的工作岗位上，有职有权，发挥着他们的作用。我们从事于电机制造工业的知识分子，从自身的体会，认识到只有在党的领导下，祖国的工业建设才可能有这样高的速度向前发展，我们的学识与经验，才能有机会作出一定的贡献，并且在实践中更加丰富起来。看到上述的辉煌成就，更使我们信心百倍地沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    我国电机制造工业在第一个五年计划中所取得的巨大成就是同苏联的真诚援助分不开的。在第一个五年计划中新建或扩建的许多现代化的电机制造工厂，从勘察、设计、施工、供应设备到掌握生产，都得到苏联的无私帮助。苏联政府派遣大批专家指导我们进行各个阶段的工作，加速了我国电机工业的建设。资产阶级右派分子企图抹煞苏联政府和人民对我国的真诚援助，恶意地挑拨中苏人民的友谊，破坏国际团结，从而破坏我国的社会主义建设，我们必须坚决予以驳斥。
    几年来我国电机制造工业各方面的成就是巨大的，成绩是主要的。
    现在请允许我就有关电机制造工业的技术发展问题，提出一些意见。
    （1）加快建设我国电机制造工业的骨干企业，保证电力装备技术水平的平衡提高。
    电机制造工业是为国家电气化提供装备的工业，它必须首先保证电力系统发展的需要。电力系统主要的物质基础是发电设备与组成高压电力网的高压电力装备——电力变压器，高压断路器，高压电力电缆，高压电瓷，避雷器等，总称为电力装备。电力装备的技术发展，要求及早生产单位容量为十万瓩及以上的大型水轮发电机组与汽轮发电机，二十二万伏及以上的高压电力装备。从我国今后电力工业的发展着想，其主体应该是建设比较大型的水电站、火电站和大型电力网；只有这样，才能够保证电力工业的建设速度。因此，掌握上述大型电力装备的生产技术是保证我国电力工业巨大发展的主要关键。问题在于先要建设一批能够制造这些巨大电力装备的骨干企业，还要花几年的时间来掌握制造这些装备的复杂而困难的技术。
    电机制造部门在第一个五年计划时期已经建设完成和在建设中的企业，仅包括了上述骨干企业的一部分。在第二个五年计划时期应该补充的项目还有：能够生产十至二十万千伏安的巨型变压器厂、高压全铝电力电缆工厂等。这类企业必须提早建设。
    电力装备的品种复杂，技术还在向前发展。为了迅速掌握并发展大型电力装备的理论和综合先进的生产经验，需要进行大量的科学研究工作。高压工程与强电流实验站是高压电力装备生产基地的组成部分，利用它来进行试验研究工作，才能够保证高压电力装备技术上的可靠性并且进一步提高技术水平，今天我们还是空白的。苏联在高压工程和强电流的科学研究工作方面，已有三十多年的历史，取得了巨大的成就；苏共二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示中，还着重提出了“组织科学研究工作试验站，来试制电压为四百千伏以上的交流电气设备”。苏联党和政府这样重视高压电力装备的科学研究工作，是值得我们学习的。现在有人主张把苏联帮助设计完成的高压强电流实验站推迟建设，这种意见是极不正确的，是会严重阻碍高压电力装备制造的发展的。
    我们认为电机制造工业在第二个五年计划期间，必须建设一整套能够全面担负大型发电设备与高压电力装备生产的骨干企业，争取在第二个五年计划期内建成，从而保证在第三个五年计划期间能够全面供应建设大型电力系统所需要的装备。建议国家计划委员会考虑迅速建设高压工程强电流实验站，加速建设西安高压开关厂和高压电瓷厂，提前设计并建设巨型变压器厂和高压电缆厂。如果国家对变压器及电缆工厂投资确有困难，可以考虑分期建设的办法：首先保证建成主要生产车间和试验设备，采用新旧企业协作的方式，提前掌握高压电力装备的生产技术。采取如上的措施，也仍然要等到第三个五年计划的中期，才有可能全面供应大型电力装备。
    （2）组织力量，进行电力装备技术发展的全面规划。
    几年来电机制造工业学习苏联先进经验，全面采用了苏联的基本技术标准，仿造了大量苏联型式规格的电力装备，为电力工业的建设服务。但是由于我们的经验不够，客观需要比较迫切，电机工业部门的科学研究工作还没有来得及及时配合，因而我们在学习苏联先进经验中，照学的多而结合我国具体情况是很不够的。苏联自从一九五五年以后，电站和电机制造的科学研究机构及有关的工厂，共同进行了大量的科学研究工作，不断发展新型电力装备；高压电力装备的绝缘水平降低了，大部分产品的重量减轻，技术经济指标提高了，原来的电工技术标准也在修订之中，这是符合于世界电工技术发展的新趋势的。面临这样新的情况，我国电力装备的选型和设计问题以及制订技术标准问题，就成为突出的矛盾了。我认为我国电机制造工业的技术发展方针，应该以认真学习苏联先进经验为主，也吸取一切国家的对我们有益的经验，结合我国具体情况，发展适合于我国使用和制造条件的新产品。我国的资源与环境条件，有很多特点：例如我国水力资源的地形条件有利，勘察规划中的水电站水头都比较高，水量较大，可以安装体积较小而单位容量很大的机组；又如我国南部处在亚热带地区，空气温度高，雨量多，湿度也很高，还有侵蚀电工器材的霉菌与昆虫。正是由于这些特点，我国电力装备的结构设计和技术标准，就不应该完全照搬苏联或其他国家的现成经验。
    我认为电机制造部应该迅速建立科学研究基地，抽调产品设计力量和试验研究力量，学会掌握苏联最新技术成就，结合我国实际，开展科学研究工作，走向独立设计。为了在新的情况下协调需要与可能的统一，建议在国家技术委员会领导下组织电力工业部与电机制造工业部，共同制订我国电力系统十年远景技术发展规划以及相应的电力装备技术发展规划；督促双方在产品选型与技术标准的制订上，在科学研究工作上的密切协作。
    （3）关于新型电工材料的供应问题
    电机制造工业技术进步的决定关键，取决于电工材料的技术水平。采用新的电工材料可使电力机器大大减轻重量，减小体积与延长寿命。大型变压器采用了高导磁冷压矽钢片就能减轻总重量百分之三十以上，缩小了体积，这是大型变压器技术发展的重大关键；发电机与电动机采用了矽有机绝缘漆和玻璃纤维等新的耐热绝缘材料，以同样的重量和体积，就能提高出力百分之三十以上，延长寿命好几倍；高级绝缘纸是制造超高压电力变压器和电力容器的关键绝缘材料。解决了上述的一些主要的新型电工材料的供应问题，就能引导电机制造工业加速技术进步，并且走向更大的节约。我国冶金、化学和造纸工业，对于上述新型电工材料的科学研究与生产安排工作，有过于迟缓的现象，特别是冷压矽钢片的科学研究工作，还没有开始，绝缘纸的科学研究工作，也缺乏布置。据了解，苏联电机制造工业，由于不能及时得到冷压矽钢片与矽有机绝缘体的足够供应，使得某些电力装备的技术经济指标还落后于世界水平，这应该引起我们的注意。建议冶金工业部在第二个五年计划初新建和改建一个专门生产冷压矽钢片的工厂，于一九六○年开始大量供应成卷的高导磁冷压矽钢片；化学工业部新建一个制造矽有机绝缘体的中间工厂，于一九五九年开始成批供应；冶金、化工和造纸工业部门都应该立即加强有关电工材料的科学研究工作。
    （4）关于电气设备的成套供应问题。
    大家都很关心电气设备的成套供应问题，特别是关于大型冶金装备或者变电所牵涉到复杂的电气系统时，怎样能保证及时成套交货，不耽误基本建设。第一个五年计划时期，工业基本建设中的大型成套设备，基本上依靠苏联供应，因而上述的问题并不突出。今后我们应该采用自己制造的设备，就必须解决相应的电气设备成套供应问题，从而加快我国工业基本建设的速度。
    电气系统的设计工作是复杂的，设计单位一方面必须采用科学研究的新成就来指导设计，一方面也必须结合我国生产实际，提出要求。电气设备的成套供应，是很复杂的组织工作，因为它牵涉到许多工厂的协作，尤其是在电气系统中遇到某些重大新产品需要试制时，将会影响成套供应的时间。一般估计，从系统设计到组织成套供应，往往会超过一年以上的时间。因此，我建议电力、冶金等部着手制订有关大型设备及相应的成套电气设备的长远需要规划，把几年后需要的成套设备早些提出来，定下来，以便于制造部门提前组织成套性的设计、试制与生产安排。这是解决我国自己制造大型机器设备与相应的成套电气设备的重要条件，希望得到有关部门的重视。
    以上几点意见，提出来供代表们的参考并请予批评指正。
    最后，我完全同意并且坚决遵守郭沫若院长代表中国科学家的宣誓：“我们中国科学家要长远地坚持自愿自觉的思想改造，在对右派分子进行坚决斗争中，进一步提高自己的政治思想水平，更加紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，沿着社会主义的道路，继续前进”。
