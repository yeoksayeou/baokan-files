(Report from our correspondent in Budapest) What kind of dirty tricks is the U.S. Embassy in Hungary up to? What role did the American diplomats play in the Hungarian October incident? A recent issue of the Hungarian youth weekly magazine quoted a lot of materials to expose it.

The U.S. Embassy in Hungary is located at 12 Freedom Square in Budapest. This embassy has a large organization, with twenty-one diplomats, thirteen administrative staff, plus one hundred and twenty Hungarian employees. In theory, so many people can play a positive role in promoting relations between Hungary and the United States. However, the facts are completely contrary to this.

Mr. Wellesz, the American Chargé d'Affaires to Hungary, has been slow to present his credentials to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic after arriving in Hungary (it should be said that this is rare in diplomatic history), and after staying in Budapest for some time, he handed over the work of the embassy to Counselor Bernays and returned to his country. Bernays joined the U.S. Embassy in Hungary in 1955. His wife is a White Russian. The diplomatic activities carried out by the American Embassy under the leadership of this Counselor are really incomprehensible. For example, not only did he not attend the reception held by the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic for the New Year this year, the Hungarian National Day reception on April 4, and the May 1st celebration, he did not even attend the wreath-laying ceremony held by the Hungarian people for the American soldiers who sacrificed for the liberation of Hungary. Even if he occasionally attended some receptions, he adopted an extremely indifferent attitude after attending.

So, what are the other diplomats in the U.S. Embassy busy with?

It turns out that they are not at all interested in normal diplomatic activities, their interest is entirely in other areas. For example, First Secretary Rogers, who has stayed in Budapest for the longest time and can already speak fluent Hungarian, had very ambiguous relations with many suspects during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots. He also personally participated in the discussions of the Petőfi Club, and appeared in the parade on Bem Square on the afternoon of October 23.

Second Secretary Nilges, who was born in Hungary, has close ties with right-wing elements in the Hungarian scientific and artistic circles. He also participated in the discussions and demonstrations of the Petőfi Club.

The former military attaché came to Budapest in 1955 and had previously worked in intelligence in West Germany. He has now been expelled from Hungary by the Hungarian government for engaging in espionage activities in Hungary.

The facts show that the likes and dislikes of the U.S. Embassy are clear. What they hate are Hungarian communists and patriotic people, and what they love are Hungarian traitors, a small group of Hungarians who oppose the socialist system. To this day, Cardinal Mindszenty is still protected by the U.S. Embassy, and most of the one hundred and twenty Hungarians employed by the U.S. Embassy are old Hungarian aristocrats and countesses. These remnants of the reactionary classes regard the U.S. Embassy as a hiding place.

    美驻匈使节干的什么勾当？
    不办外交  干涉内政  收集情报  庇护叛徒
    本报布达佩斯讯  美国驻匈牙利使馆在匈牙利干些什么勾当？美国的外交人员在匈牙利十月事件中扮演了些什么角色？不久以前出版的一期匈牙利青年周刊上曾经引用许多材料进行了揭露。
    美国驻匈使馆设在布达佩斯自由广场十二号。这个使馆有着一个庞大的机构，有二十一名外交官，十三名行政人员，外加一百二十名匈牙利雇员。照理，这样多的人是可以在促进匈美两国关系上起积极作用的。但是，事实却完全与此相反。
    美国驻匈牙利公使韦尔兹先生来匈后迟迟不向匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席呈递国书，（应该说，这在外交史上是少见的），而在布达佩斯耽了一些时候就把使馆的工作交给参赞贝尔乃斯，自己回国去了。贝尔乃斯是1955年参加美国驻匈牙利使馆工作的。他的妻子是一个白俄。在这位参赞领导下的美国公使馆所进行的外交活动，实在是难以理解的。譬如，他不但没有参加匈牙利人民共和国主席团在今年新年所举行的招待会，4月4日匈牙利国庆招待会和5月1日的庆祝会，甚至于匈牙利人民为解放匈牙利而牺牲的一些美国战士所举行的献花圈仪式也没有出席。即使他偶而出席了一些招待会，也在到会以后采取了极其冷淡的态度。
    那么，美国使馆里的另外一些外交官们又在忙些什么呢？
    原来他们对那些正常的外交活动是丝毫也不感兴趣的，他们的兴趣完全在另外一方面。举例来说，曾在布达佩斯耽的时间最长，已经能操一口流利匈牙利语的一等秘书罗吉斯，在匈牙利反革命暴乱期间同许多嫌疑分子勾勾搭搭，关系非常暧昧。他还曾亲自参加过裴多菲俱乐部的讨论，并且在10月23日下午还出现在贝姆将军广场的游行队伍里。
    出生在匈牙利的二等秘书尼尔格斯同匈牙利科学艺术界的右派分子有着密切联系，他也参加了裴多菲俱乐部的讨论和游行示威。
    前任武官是1955年来布达佩斯的，过去曾在西德干过情报工作。由于他在匈牙利进行间谍活动，现在已被匈牙利政府驱逐出境。
    事实说明美国使馆的憎爱是分明的。他们所憎恨的是匈牙利共产党人、爱国志士，他们所爱的是匈牙利的叛徒、一小撮反对社会主义制度的匈牙利人。至今红衣主教明曾蒂还受着美国使馆的庇护，美国公使馆所雇用的一百二十名匈牙利人多半是旧匈牙利的贵族和伯爵夫人。这些反动阶级的残余分子把美国使馆当作了藏身之所。
