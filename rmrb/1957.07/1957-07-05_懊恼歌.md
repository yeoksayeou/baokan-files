    Ballad of Regret
    Yuan Shuipai
    It's clearly a sunny day with beautiful spring scenery, but they say it's just a brief warming spell before more snow;
    It's clearly a broad and straight road, but they say it's a narrow and winding path full of potholes;
    It's clearly the locomotive of the new China roaring forward, but they say the socialist train is about to stall;
    It's clear that thousands of new railways and highways have been built through mountains and valleys, but they say:
    To give an example, the road in front of my house is thawing and muddy!
    I regret that the spring dream was just wishful thinking,
    I blame the devil for clouding my mind,
    I'm angry that everyone has abandoned me and shown no loyalty,
    I hate my bad luck for stumbling and falling,
    I regret blurting out my opinions rashly,
    I sigh that I've always been clever and resourceful, but this time I bet on the wrong horse!

    懊恼歌
    袁水拍明明是艳阳天气春光好，却道是乍暖还寒雪未消；明明是康庄大道直苗苗，却道是羊肠小径多坑凹；明明是新中国的火车头轰隆隆前进，却道是社会主义的列车快要抛锚；明明是穿山越岭铁路公路新修千百条，却道是：举个例，本宅门口的马路翻浆了！恼只恼春梦一场天方晓，怪只怪鬼使神差迷心窍，气只气众叛亲离无情义，恨只恨流年不利栽一交，悔只悔冒冒失失放大炮，叹只叹一向神机妙算，这回压错了宝！
