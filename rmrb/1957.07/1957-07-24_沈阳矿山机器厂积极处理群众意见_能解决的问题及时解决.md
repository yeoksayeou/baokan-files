(Liaoning Daily) Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant actively handles the well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions put forward by its employees. The Party Committee's Rectification Office organized and summarized the opinions put forward by the employees three times. To ensure that everyone's opinions were handled seriously and carefully, the Rectification Office also investigated and supplemented some unclear opinions by consulting the individuals who raised them. The Party Committee divided these organized opinions into eleven categories according to their nature and assigned relevant departments to form groups of leading Party member cadres to handle them specifically.

Some problems that could be solved immediately have now been resolved. In the past, some leading Party member cadres occupied too many houses; now they have vacated them. Someone once suggested that the Deputy Section Chief of the Forging and Metallurgy Section was not skilled enough and unable to lead the work of the section, which was detrimental to the work. After the leadership studied the matter, they felt this opinion was correct and transferred the deputy section chief to another unit and appointed a new section chief. Someone suggested that the leading cadres of the Workers' Technical School were weak and that the political and ideological education of the students was poor. After the leadership studied this opinion and the situation of the school, they newly appointed a vice principal and a Party branch secretary. In terms of management, someone suggested that the organizational structure was too large, the responsibilities were unclear, and there were many instances of buck-passing. The factory then organized a special group to study the organizational structure. Now the organizational design has been completed, and some departments have been merged and adjusted. This will not only reduce the phenomenon of buck-passing but also free up more than one hundred cadres. In terms of the reward system, in the past, bonuses for cadres above the section level were too high. Now it has been decided to abolish the bonuses for factory-level leading cadres. Some Party member cadres had a bad work style in the past. After criticism from the masses and education from the Party Committee, many people began to overcome shortcomings such as a lack of in-depth work and bureaucracy.

The employees were very touched by the factory Party Committee's serious and earnest attitude towards the opinions of the masses. Some employees said: The rectification movement is so great. The Party never shies away from shortcomings and resolutely corrects them when there are shortcomings. We must be more active in protecting the Party and resisting the right-wingers' attack on the Party and socialism.

    沈阳矿山机器厂积极处理群众意见
    能解决的问题及时解决
    本报讯　辽宁日报消息：沈阳矿山机器厂积极处理职工群众提出来的善意的批评和建议。党委整风办公室把职工们提出来的意见，进行了三次整理和归纳；为了使大家提的意见都能做到认真严肃的处理，整风办公室还把一些提得不清楚不明确的意见，找本人做了调查和补充。党委把这些经过整理的意见按性质分成十一类，责成各有关部门的党员领导干部组成小组进行专门处理。
    一些马上可以解决的问题现在已经解决了。过去有的党员领导干部占用房子过多，现在已经把房子让出来了。有人曾经提出锻冶科党员副科长水平太低，领导不起科里的工作，对工作没有好处，领导方面研究后觉得这个意见是对的，便把这个副科长调到其他单位，配备了新的科长。有人提出工人技术学校领导干部弱，对学生的政治思想教育差，领导方面研究了这个意见和学校的情况以后，新配备了一个副校长和一个党支部书记。在管理方面，有人提出组织机构庞大，职责不清，扯皮问题很多。工厂便专门组织了一个小组对组织机构进行了研究，现在组织设计已经搞完，有些科室作了合并调整。这样不但可以减少扯皮现象，还可以抽调出一百多名干部。在奖励制度方面，过去科级以上干部奖金偏高，现在已经决定取消厂一级领导干部的奖金。有的党员干部过去作风不好，经群众批评、党委教育以后，不少人都开始克服了工作不深入、官僚主义等缺点。
    职工们对工厂党委严肃认真地对待群众意见的态度，都很感动。有些职工说：整风运动太伟大了，党决不讳避缺点，有缺点就坚决改正。我们一定要更加积极起来保护党，反击右派分子向党、向社会主义的进攻。
