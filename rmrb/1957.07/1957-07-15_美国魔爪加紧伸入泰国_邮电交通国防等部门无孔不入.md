Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, July 14th: According to a report in the "Free Communications Daily" on the 10th, the United States is expanding the scope of its "aid" to Thailand. The U.S. agency responsible for foreign aid has decided to allocate a large amount of funds and send a large number of "technical personnel" to "assist" Thailand in improving its postal, telecommunications, and transportation services.

The Thai Minister of Transportation, Nai Warin, confirmed to reporters from the "Free Communications Daily" on the 9th that the United States has made this proposal to Thailand, and the Thai authorities have agreed in principle.

Currently, personnel from various U.S. "aid" agencies have infiltrated many departments of the Thai government. For example, personnel from the "U.S. Military Advisory Group" have infiltrated every department and bureau of the Thai Ministry of Defense. A U.S. intelligence agency called the "Maritime Supply Agency" is operating under the guise of "doing business," recently smuggling a batch of weapons and materials to the Thai Ministry of Interior and helping to arm and train the Thai police. This agency also provides extensive "assistance" to the Policy Investigation Department of the Thai State Council (i.e., the intelligence bureau).

In addition, so-called "aid" personnel from the United States have infiltrated the Thai Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, and other government departments.

    美国魔爪加紧伸入泰国
    邮电交通国防等部门无孔不入
    据新华社14日讯　曼谷消息：据“自由通讯报”10日报道，美国正在扩大对泰国的“援助”范围。美国负责援外事务的机构已经决定拨出大量款项和派遣大批“技术人员”来“援助”泰国改进邮电交通事业。
    泰国交通部长乃挽若9日向“自由通讯报”记者证实，美国已经向泰国提出这个建议，泰国当局已经在原则上表示接受。
    目前，美国各种“援助”机构的人员渗入了泰国政府的许多部门。例如，“美国军事顾问团”的人员渗入泰国国防部的每一个厅局。美国的一个叫作“海上供应署”的情报机构以“做生意”为名进行活动，最近私运了一批武器和物资供给泰国内政部，并且帮助武装和训练泰国警察。这个机构还多方“援助”泰国国务院政务调查厅（按即情报局）。
    此外，在泰国农业部、财政部、教育部以及其他政府部门中，都同样渗入了美国的所谓“援助”人员。
