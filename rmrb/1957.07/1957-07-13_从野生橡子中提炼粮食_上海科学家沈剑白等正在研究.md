Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th: Some university professors and scientific workers in Shanghai, entrusted by the government, are assisting an old scientist, Shen Jianbai, in researching the extraction and manufacture of grain from various inedible wild acorns. In the laboratory built with government funding, the old scientist and his assistants have extracted pure white starch like flour and a grayish-yellow glucose from a type of acorn from Zhejiang. Currently, they are conducting experiments to see if this starch can replace flour used for sizing and further simplifying the operation procedures for extracting starch, accumulating research data in order to introduce these methods to places where acorns are abundant.

Acorns and the chestnuts that people often eat are both fruits of trees belonging to the Fagaceae family. These trees are found throughout the cold, temperate, and tropical zones of our country, and their fruits, like chestnuts, contain a large amount of starch. Because acorn kernels, in addition to starch, also contain bitter tannins and saponins, they have never been used as food. Tens of thousands of dan of acorns are used as firewood or fertilizer in the mountains.

Shen Jianbai's research work is to remove the tannins and saponins from the acorns. Over the past few years, based on domestic folk experience and foreign materials, he has found many methods for removing tannins and saponins, such as water immersion, freezing, adding alkali and heating, and fermentation.

    从野生橡子中提炼粮食
    上海科学家沈剑白等正在研究
    新华社上海12日电　上海一些大学教授和科学工作者，接受政府的委托，协助一位老科学家沈剑白，研究从野生的不能食用的各种橡子里，提炼和制造粮食。在政府拨款筹建起来的实验室里，这位老科学家和他的助手，已从一种来自浙江的橡子里，提炼出洁白如面的淀粉和一种灰黄色的葡萄糖。目前，他们正在作这种淀粉能否代替浆纱用的面粉等试验和进一步简化提炼淀粉的操作手续，积累研究资料，以便将这些方法介绍给盛产橡子的地方。
    橡子同人们常吃的栗子都是属于壳斗科一类树木的果实。这种树木遍布于我国寒、温、热三带，它所结的果实和栗子一样含有大量淀粉。因为橡子的果仁里，除淀粉外还含有苦涩的单宁和皂素，所以历来不作食用。成千上万担橡子在山里作为柴薪或肥料。
    沈剑白的研究工作就是把橡子里的单宁和皂素提净。几年来他根据国内流传在民间的经验和国外资料，找到了水浸、冰冻、加碱加温和发酵等许多去除单宁和皂素的方法。
