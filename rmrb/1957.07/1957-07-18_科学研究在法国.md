Scientific research in France is conducted under the leadership of three entities. First, universities under the Ministry of Education, the forty research institutes affiliated with the National Center for Scientific Research, and the National Technical Research Association. Second, more than thirty industrial consortium research institutions funded by the industrial sector. Third, there are some private organizations, such as the Pasteur Institute and research departments of some private companies.

After World War II, nuclear energy research in France was developed quite slowly. It was not until 1955 that G. Palewski formulated a plan, which enabled the Atomic Energy Commission to obtain a fund equivalent to 100 million pounds for use between 1955 and 1958, mainly in industrial construction. Now, France has about 1,800 technicians engaged in atomic energy research, but this is still quite behind compared to the 5,000 in the United Kingdom and the 15,000 in the United States. Its first nuclear power plant was built in Marcoule, near Avignon (a city in southern France), on a small scale. The second nuclear power plant is scheduled to start generating electricity in the last quarter of this year. The third is expected to be completed in 1958. By then, the entire French electrical system will obtain 50,000 kilowatts of electricity from nuclear energy sources. The 200 pounds of plutonium produced annually from the three reactors in Marcoule will be used for industrial purposes and is not intended for making atomic bombs. However, the use of nuclear energy to build engines for warships and submarines is also being researched and designed.

Due to the disruption of the education organization system after the war, France's lack of talent in science is quite serious. Of the 151,000 students who entered university in 1954, only 29,000 were engaged in scientific or engineering studies, and only 3,900 of them reached a level where they could graduate, and 650 could become graduate students.

The recently established Landucci Science Humanpower Research Committee has recommended that the number of science and engineering students should be doubled in the next ten years, and that scholarships should be increased for advanced studies. In addition, the Higher Scientific Research and Technical Improvement Committee has also conducted a detailed survey of France's existing technical resources. It has made statistics on the potential of French scientific research in terms of personnel and materials, thereby determining some research goals and funding methods. Now this committee is still continuing to investigate the current situation of scientific personnel training and the industrial use of inventions. It has also inspected the mutual cooperation and exchange of information between research institutions.

### 科学研究在法国

    科学研究在法国
    科学研究在法国是由三个方面领导进行的。第一，在教育部领导下的有各大学、国立科学研究院所属的四十个研究所以及国立技术研究协会。第二，由实业界出资设立的三十多个工业组合研究机构。第三，还有一些私人组织，如巴斯德研究所和一些私营公司的研究部门。
    第二次世界大战以后，核子能研究在法国开展得颇为迟缓。到了1955年才由帕留斯基（G．Palew-ski）制订了一项计划，从而为原子能委员会获得一笔相当于一亿英镑的基金，供1955—58年间使用，主要是在工业建造方面。现在法国已经约有一千八百名技术人员从事原子能的研究工作，但同英国的五千人和美国的一万五千人比较起来还是相当落后的。它的第一个核子发电站建立在邻近亚威农（Avignon，法国南部的一个城市）的马寇尔
  （Marcoule）地方，规模不大。第二个核子发电站计划在今年末季开始发电。第三个预计在1958年建成。到那时，全法国电气系统将从核子能来源方面获得五万启罗瓦特的电力。每年从马寇尔的三个反应堆生产出来的二百磅钚将用于工业方面，而不打算制造原子弹。但是，利用核子能制造军舰和潜水艇的发动机也正在研究设计中。
    由于战后教育组织系统的紊乱，法国在科学方面的人才缺乏的情况颇为严重。在1954年考入大学的十五万一千名学生中，只有二万九千人从事科学或工程学的专业学习，而其中仅有三千九百人达到可以毕业的水平，六百五十人可以转为研究生。
    最近成立的兰杜西（Landu-cci）科学人力研究委员会建议，在未来十年内科学和工程学的学生数目应增加一倍，并且为进修学习增加助学基金。此外，高等科学研究及技术改进委员会也把法国现有的技术资源作了详细调查。它对法国科学研究在人员和物质方面的潜力进行了统计，从而确定了一些研究的目标和拨款办法。现在这个委员会仍在继续调查目前科学人员训练的情况和发明在工业上利用的情况。它还对各研究机关的互相配合和交换资料方面进行了检查。
