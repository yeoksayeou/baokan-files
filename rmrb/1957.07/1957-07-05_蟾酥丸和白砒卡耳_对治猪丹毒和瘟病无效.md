    Toad Venom Pills and White Arsenic Cakes
    Ineffective Against Swine Erysipelas and Swine Fever
    (Our Dispatch) The widely circulated folk remedies in rural areas for treating swine erysipelas, swine pleuropneumonia, and swine fever—Toad Venom Pills and White Arsenic Cakes—have recently been proven ineffective through multiple scientific tests.
    These two remedies were proposed by Sun Liangchen, a traditional Chinese veterinary doctor from Sichuan Province. In 1951, at a symposium on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine in Sichuan Province, these remedies were introduced as experiences and were subsequently promoted and disseminated throughout Sichuan. Later, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture also introduced these two remedies in the People's Daily (see page 2 of this newspaper, February 28, 1954). After trial use in various regions, some believed they could be applied, while others found them of little use. In this situation, the Ministry of Agriculture designated the Veterinary Biological Products Inspection Institute to conduct scientific experiments in June 1954. Based on Sun Liangchen's remedies, the institute commissioned the Beijing Tongrentang Pharmacy to prepare Toad Venom Pills and White Arsenic Pills, which were then used in experiments on pigs suffering from swine erysipelas, swine fever, and swine pleuropneumonia. The results of the experiments demonstrated minimal therapeutic effect. Two more experiments were conducted from January to March this year, with results consistent with the 1954 experiments. Dr. Sun Liangchen, who originally proposed the remedies, also participated in the experiments.
    Scientific workers believe that, to date, the relatively effective methods are using anti-swine fever serum to treat swine fever, anti-swine erysipelas serum or penicillin to treat swine erysipelas, and anti-swine pleuropneumonia serum or sulfonamide drugs to treat swine pleuropneumonia. For prevention, the use of swine fever crystal violet vaccine and rabbit-adapted swine fever attenuated vaccine for preventing swine fever, swine erysipelas aluminum hydroxide vaccine for preventing swine erysipelas, and swine pleuropneumonia aluminum hydroxide vaccine for preventing swine pleuropneumonia all have good results.

### 蟾酥丸和白砒卡耳  对治猪丹毒和瘟病无效

    蟾酥丸和白砒卡耳
    对治猪丹毒和瘟病无效
    本报讯　在全国农村中流传很广的医治猪丹毒、猪肺疫和猪瘟的验方——蟾酥丸和白砒卡耳，最近经过多次科学试验证明无效。
    这两个验方是四川省中兽医孙良臣提出来的。1951年在四川省中兽医座谈会上，将这验方作为经验介绍后，就在四川各地宣传、推广了。后来农业部畜牧兽医总局又将这两个验方在人民日报上介绍了（见1954年2月28日本报二版）。各地试用后，有的认为可以应用，有的认为效用不大。在这种情况下，农业部曾于1954年6月指定兽医生物药品监察所作科学试验。该所根据孙良臣验方，请北京同仁堂药店配成蟾酥丸及白砒丸，分别对患猪丹毒、猪瘟、猪肺疫的猪进行了试验。试验的结果证明疗效极小。今年1月到3月，又作了两次试验，和1954年试验结果相同。原来提出验方的孙良臣医师也参加了试验。
    科学工作者认为：迄今为止，用抗猪瘟血清治疗猪瘟、抗猪丹毒血清或盘尼西林治疗猪丹毒、抗猪肺疫血清或磺胺类药物治疗猪肺疫是比较有效的办法。在预防上，采用猪瘟结晶紫疫苗及兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗预防猪瘟、猪丹毒氢氧化铝菌苗预防猪丹毒和猪肺疫氢氧化铝菌苗预防猪肺疫都有良好的效果。
