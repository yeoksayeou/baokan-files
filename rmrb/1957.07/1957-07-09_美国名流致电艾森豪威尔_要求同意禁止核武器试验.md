Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th July: Eighty-three prominent figures in American political, trade union, religious, and scientific circles jointly telegraphed Eisenhower on July 7th, demanding that the U.S. government reach an agreement with relevant countries to ban all nuclear weapons testing. They said that the proposals put forward by the United States in this regard should "not be subject to unnecessary conditions."

They pointed out that if the current London Disarmament Conference fails, "it will have an extremely adverse impact on future disarmament negotiations and will greatly damage the prestige of the United States among world citizens."

The initiators of the telegram included: Norman Thomas, leader of the Socialist Party of America, Robert Nathan, Chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, Charles Price, former president of the Federation of American Scientists, and Raymond Wilson, Executive Secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation.

Signatories to the telegram included: Paul Doty, President of the Federation of American Scientists, Dr. David Inglis, a renowned physicist, Walter Reuther, President of the United Automobile Workers, and Reverend Reinhold Niebuhr.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th July: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on July 7th: U.S. Representative Porter recently introduced a bill to the House of Representatives demanding that the United States halt nuclear weapons testing. He said that the danger of nuclear explosions is "the most significant issue facing the U.S. Congress."

Other members of the House of Representatives, such as Coffin Nattsson and Edwin May, also protested against continued atomic and hydrogen bomb testing. Edwin May said that many voters in his district in Connecticut felt "very alarmed" by the testing of such weapons. He said: "I think that, given the widespread global interest in disarmament issues, it would be beneficial to discuss this matter at this time."

In newspapers, there are also more and more opinions advocating for an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing. The "Times", published in Hartford, Connecticut, said that stopping testing is "the most important goal now." The "Alamo Chronicle" wrote: "Testing should stop immediately." It pointed out that many readers had written or visited the newspaper to express their support for this proposition.

A reader of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" wrote that a group of citizens in San Diego, California, had established an association to strive for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    美国名流致电艾森豪威尔
    要求同意禁止核武器试验
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国有社会声望的政治、工会、宗教和科学界人士八十三人7日联名致电艾森豪威尔，要求美国政府同有关国家达成协议，禁止一切核武器试验。他们说，美国在这方面提出的提案应当“不附带不必要条件”。
    他们指出，万一目前的伦敦裁军会议失败，“那就会对未来的裁军谈判产生极其不利的影响，而且会大大损害美国在世界人士间的威信”。
    电报的发起人包括：美国社会党领袖诺曼·托马斯、美国人民主行动协会主席罗伯特·纳山、前美国科学工作者协会主席查尔斯·普赖斯和公谊会全国立法委员会执行秘书雷蒙·威尔逊。
    在电报上签名的人有：美国科学工作者协会主席保罗·多蒂、著名物理学家戴维·英格利斯博士、联合汽车工人工会主席华尔特·路德和莱霍德·尼布尔牧师等。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：美国众议员波特尔最近向众议院提出了要求美国停止核武器试验的法案。他说，核爆炸的危险是“美国国会所面临的最重大的问题”。
    抗议继续试验原子弹和氢弹的还有众议院的其他一些议员，如科·纳特逊和埃德温·梅。埃德温·梅说，康?狄格州他的选区的许多选民对试验这种武器感到“十分惊惶”。他说：“我认为，由于全世界对裁军问题普遍感到兴趣，在目前讨论这个问题是很有好处的。”
    在报刊上，主张立刻停止核武器试验的言论也愈来愈多了。在康?狄格州哈特福德出版的“时报”说，停止试验是“现在最重要的目标”。“阿拉莫纪事报”写道：“试验应当即刻停止。”它指出，有许多读者来信或是亲自到报社来，表示响应这个主张。
    “圣路易邮报”上有一位读者投书说，加利福尼亚州的圣地亚哥有一批市民已经建立了一个争取停止核武器试验协会。
