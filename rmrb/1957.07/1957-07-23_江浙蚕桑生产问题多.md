Sericulture has a history of thousands of years in our country. The development of sericulture is related to the vitality of the rural economy, the development of foreign trade, and the lives of tens of thousands of silk workers. This can be seen from the situation in Jiangsu Province: Jiangsu Province has 500,000 mu of mulberry fields, and the income from silkworm cocoons is equivalent to 800,000 dan of rice, which can support 10,000 people. It plays a role in adjusting production funds and living materials in rural areas during the lean season. At the same time, these silkworm cocoons can provide employment for 24,000 people in the silk industry. If each employee has three family members, it will solve the livelihood of 96,000 people. In 1956, the silk industry in the province handed over 5.3 million yuan to the state (excluding 1 million yuan for capital construction investment), which is equivalent to 40% of the fixed asset output value of the entire silk industry. This is indeed an industry with little investment and great returns.

Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the main silk-producing areas in the country. Since liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the government, sericulture production has been maintained and developed, and silk production has increased. Taking Jiangsu as an example, the estimated output of raw silk in 1957 is seven times that of 1950, and the estimated output of silk is nine times that of 1950. The quality of silk has exceeded the pre-war level in our country.

Silkworm cocoon production declines year by year

However, in recent years, there have been significant problems in silkworm cocoon production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Silkworm and mulberry production has seriously declined, and silkworm cocoon production cannot keep up with the needs of the silk industry. The amount of spring cocoons collected in Jiangsu has been declining year by year: 191,800 dan in 1953, 180,000 dan in 1954, 174,080 dan in 1955, only 168,000 dan in 1956, and an estimated 143,800 dan this year. Silkworm cocoon production has not only been small in quantity over the years, but also of poor quality. This can be seen from historical data in Jiangsu:

In 1953, an average cocoon could produce 569 meters of silk, but in 1956, it could only produce 459 meters of silk; the silk reeling length rate per cocoon also decreased from 69% in 1953 to 52%; the cocoon silk fineness (thickness) range, according to a survey of raw materials in 168 regions of the province in 1956, raw materials in 49.4 regions were not suitable for fixed-particle reeling in the silk reeling industry, and the cocoon silk fineness (thickness) difference was about one to four times. 20% of the year's raw materials are sub-cocoons or scraps, which is a figure that deserves attention.

Why has silkworm cocoon production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, especially Jiangsu Province, formed this situation in recent years?

Mulberry field management urgently needs to be strengthened

The raw material of silk is raw silk, the raw material of raw silk is silkworm cocoons, and the raw material of silkworm cocoons is mulberry leaves. In the two provinces' silk-producing areas, mulberry trees are generally old, there are many missing trees, the amount of fertilizer applied to mulberry gardens is small, and in some places, other crops are planted in mulberry gardens, coupled with poor management of mulberry gardens, resulting in a decline in mulberry field production. Although some areas have developed new mulberry fields, the survival rate of mulberry seedlings planted is very low due to poor technical handling. According to relevant materials: the highest survival rate is 90%, and the lowest is only 50%. Moreover, mulberry trees are perennial plants, and mulberry leaves can only be used to feed silkworms three to five years after planting. While new mulberry trees are being cultivated, old mulberry trees are declining year by year due to improper management, which affects the cocoon production of the entire region. If we do not strengthen the management of old mulberry trees and urgently strive to apply summer fertilizer immediately, the unit yield per mu of mulberry fields next year will be lower, and the phenomenon of "inverted silkworms" (poor silk production) will be more serious. Strengthening the management of mulberry forests or mulberry fields is the fundamental problem of silkworm cocoon production.

Silkworm varieties need to be improved

Secondly, we should urgently find ways to research and improve silkworm varieties. The varieties currently promoted in our country are still improved silkworm varieties from more than ten years ago, with a total silk length of only 850-1,000 meters per cocoon. However, in some more advanced silk countries, the total silk length per cocoon is 1,100-1,200 meters. In addition, in order to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for silkworm breeding, the state's purchase price of silkworm cocoons, as well as the work points for agriculture and silkworm breeding as stipulated, should be reasonable.

The phenomenon of decentralized leadership should be changed

There are also problems in the organizational leadership of sericulture production. From mulberry to silk, it is managed by five departments. From the perspective of Jiangsu Province, mulberry forests belong to the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, silkworm breeding belongs to the Sericulture Administration Bureau, silk production belongs to the Silk Industry Bureau, the sale of raw silk belongs to the Silk Company, and the purchase of silkworm cocoon raw materials belongs to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. With more departments, the relationship in dealing with problems becomes complicated. Due to such decentralized leadership, the phenomenon of buck-passing and each doing their own thing has been very serious in recent years. The final reflection of the quantity and quality of silkworm cocoon raw materials is the silk reeling industry department, but the industrial department has the idea of a supply system, doing what they have, and doing as much as they have, without actively reporting to relevant departments to promote the improvement of the quantity and quality of silkworm cocoons. This current leadership method should be changed urgently. At least two of the five leading departments can be cut. Silkworms and mulberries are originally an organic combination. Why should two departments manage them? From the current relationship between industry and commerce, the Silk Company should be responsible for the supply and sale of raw materials and finished products, but why does it entrust the supply and marketing department to intervene in the purchase of raw materials? The decline in sericulture production in recent years is inseparable from the leadership of the above-mentioned organizational form and should be changed urgently. Establish a unified organization to study measures to save sericulture production and change the status quo.

In the vast silkworm cocoon producing areas, the state reward system should be implemented, the work points for mulberry field management and silkworm feeding should be adjusted, and reasonable silkworm cocoon prices should be studied. Sericulture production should be protected from the aspects of organization, system, and policy. In this way, the sericulture production of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will soon show a new look.

    江浙蚕桑生产问题多
    沈正祺
    蚕丝事业在我国已有几千年历史。蚕丝事业的发展，关系着农村经济的活跃，对外贸易的发展，以及几万丝绸工人的生活。这从江苏省的情况就可以看出：江苏省有五十万亩桑田，蚕茧收入约折合八十万担大米，可养活一万人，对全省农村起着青黄不接时调剂生产资金和生活资料的作用；同时，这些蚕茧可以安排丝绸在业人员二万四千人，若每个职工有三个家属，则解决了九万六千人的生活问题。1956年全省丝绸工业给国家上缴了五百三十万元（除掉基建投资一百万元），等于全丝绸行业固定资产产值的40％。这确是一个投资少，收效大的行业。
    江苏、浙江是全国主要产蚕区。解放几年来，在党和政府的大力支持下，蚕丝生产是得到了维持与发展，丝绸的产量提高了。仍以江苏为例，1957年生丝预计产量为1950年七倍，丝绸预计产量为九倍。丝绸的质量已经超过我国战前水平。
    蚕茧生产逐年下降
    但近几年来，江、浙二省蚕茧生产存在很大问题。蚕桑产量严重下降，蚕茧生产跟不上丝绸工业需要。江苏春茧的收茧量是逐年下降的：1953年收茧十九万一千八百市担，1954年为十八万市担，1955年再减为十七万四千零八十市担，1956年只收十六万八千市担，预计今年收十四万三千八百市担。蚕茧生产历年来不但量少，而且质差。这从江苏的历史资料可以看出：
    1953年一颗茧平均可缫丝五百六十九公尺，1956年只能缫丝四百五十九公尺；每颗茧缫丝长率也由1953年的69％降为52％；茧丝纤度
  （粗细）幅度，从1956年全省一百六十八个地区原料的调查，有四十九点四个地区原料不合缫丝工业的定粒缫丝，茧丝纤度（粗细）开差约有一——四倍左右。全年原料中有20％是次茧或下脚茧，这是一个值得引起注意的数目字。
    为什么江、浙二省，特别是江苏省近几年来蚕茧生产会形成这一局面呢？
    桑田管理急待加强
    丝绸的原料是生丝，生丝的原料是蚕茧，蚕茧的原料是桑叶。而该二省蚕区普遍是桑树老、缺株多，桑园的施肥量少，有些地方又在桑园内作了其他作物，加上对桑园经营管理差，因此桑田产量下降。个别地区虽开拓了新区桑田，但种植的桑苗由于技术处理差，成活率很低。据有关材料：成活率，最高的是90％，最低竟达50％。且桑树是多年生植物，种植后要三到五年后桑叶才能喂蚕。新区桑树在培植中，老区桑树因管理不当，逐年衰退着，以致影响到整个地区的产茧量。若再不加强对老区的桑树管理，急速争取立即施加夏肥，明年每亩桑田的单位产量将更低，倒蚕现象将更严重。加强桑林或桑田管理，是蚕茧生产的根本问题。
        蚕种需要改良
    其次应急速设法研究改良蚕种。我国目前所推行的品种还是十多年以前的改良蚕种，每颗茧的全丝长只有八百五十——一千公尺左右。但一些较先进的蚕丝国家，每颗茧全丝长有一千一百——一千二百公尺。此外，为了鼓励农民养蚕的积极性，国家收购蚕茧的价格，以及农业和所规定的养蚕的工分均应合理。
  分散领导的现象应该改变
    在蚕丝生产的组织领导上亦存在问题。从桑到丝由五个部门管理，从江苏省情况看桑林属农林厅，养蚕属蚕管局，蚕丝生产属丝绸工业局，生丝的销售属丝绸公司，蚕茧原料的收购又属供销合作社。部门多，处理问题的关系就复杂。由于这样的分散领导，几年来扯皮现象，各自为政现象很严重。蚕茧原料量与质的最终反映是缫丝工业部门，但工业部门存在供给制思想，有什么做什么；有多少做多少，没有积极向有关部门反映，促使蚕茧量与质的改进。目前这种领导方式应急速改变，五个领导部门起码可以砍掉二个，蚕与桑本来是有机结合体，为什么要二个部门去管呢？从目前的工商关系看，丝绸公司应当负责原料与成品的供应、销售，但其中在原料的收购上又委托了供销部门从中插一手呢？几年来蚕丝生产逐年下降是与上面这种组织形式的领导分不开的，应急速改变。成立统一机构，研究挽救蚕丝生产措施，改变现状。
    在广大产蚕茧区应实行国家奖励制度，调整桑田管理及饲育养蚕的工分，研究合理的蚕茧价格，从组织上、制度上，政策上来保护蚕茧生产，这样，江浙二省的蚕茧生产不久将出现一个新面貌。
