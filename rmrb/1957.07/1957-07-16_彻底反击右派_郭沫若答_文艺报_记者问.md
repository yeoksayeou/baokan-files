Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The fifteenth issue of "Literary Gazette," published on the 14th, featured Guo Moruo's answers to four questions posed by a "Literary Gazette" reporter, the question being "Thoroughly Repulse the Rightists." The full text is as follows:

    1. How should we strengthen our fight to achieve a complete victory in the anti-rightist struggle? How can we achieve the expected results of rectification? What is the relationship between the anti-rightist struggle and rectification?

    Answer: The current anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists must be thoroughly repulsed without any relaxation. Of course, the weapons for the counterattack are truth and facts, and we must also expose the hypocrisy and ugliness of the rightists and deprive them of their weapons. This will not only strike at the rightists but also educate non-rightists.

    Rightists, like poisonous weeds, are not easily eradicated. In the future, all intellectuals must constantly engage in self-political education and ideological education to prevent the emergence of right-leaning thoughts in order to achieve "complete victory." No one can ignore ideological remolding, and no one can leave the weapons of criticism and self-criticism for a moment.

    In the struggle against rightists, distinguishing right from wrong and standing firm are helpful for rectification. Rectification must "correct mistakes whenever they are discovered" and must not avoid treatment for fear of illness. Sincere and sharp criticisms should be accepted sincerely and should not be confused with the attacks of rightists.

    The anti-rightist struggle is a class struggle in politics and ideology, and rectification is the adjustment of contradictions among the people. Although they are carried out simultaneously, their natures are different.

    However, the effects of the two are intertwined. Resolute struggle against the rightists can help rectification, and serious and earnest rectification can draw a line between us and the rightists and increase our fighting spirit.

    The rampant attacks of the rightists have promoted our vigilance, strengthened our unity, and improved our work style. From this point of view, poisonous weeds, when turned over with their roots, do indeed become fertilizer.

    2. Some people say that since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, our works have been formulaic and conceptual, and their ideological and artistic qualities are not high. How should we refute this absurd argument? What kind of assessment should be made of the achievements of our socialist literary and artistic cause?

    Answer: In recent years, I have seen very few literary works, and it is difficult for me to give a comprehensive critique of them. But one thing I can say with certainty is that after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, creative practice received clear guidance, and the ideological content of literature and art has been improved.

    The level of artistry depends on what is used as the standard. If we take the general works before liberation as the standard, then from the new works I have come into contact with, I feel that they have generally improved, not declined. Of course, works that are worthy of the great era and that shock the past and the present do not seem to have been produced yet. But such works did not exist before liberation either.

    The tendency to be formulaic and conceptual may exist, but to say that all works are formulaic and conceptual is an unreasonable and slanderous overall negation.

    Our socialist literary and artistic cause, with the progress of socialist construction, with the increasing accumulation of writers' life experiences, and with the increasing refinement of their thoughts and skills, will inevitably develop more vigorously. New national forms and unprecedented great creations will inevitably emerge, and there is no doubt about this.

    3. Some people say that the Party cannot lead literature and art, that "laymen cannot lead experts." At the same time, they attempt to abolish the Party's ideological and organizational leadership over literary and artistic work by taking advantage of the labor characteristics of writers and the shortcomings of certain administrative methods of literary and artistic leadership. How should we smash this fallacy?

    Answer: "The Party cannot lead X" is a formula for bourgeois rightists to attack the Party and socialism. This X can be replaced by "literature and art," "science," "education," or even "politics." The rightists' theory is the opposite of ours. Therefore, the correctness of the proposition should be understood from the opposite perspective. The formula "The Party cannot lead X" only needs to have the word "cannot" removed, and everything will be fine.

    The Party is capable of leading literature and art. The direction, people's character, and Party spirit of literature and art cannot be achieved without the leadership of the Party. The cultivation, organization, and encouragement of artists cannot be separated from the leadership of the Party.

    Why can the Party lead everything? Because the Party is the Party of Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism conducts concrete analysis and provides concrete leadership based on specific situations.

    I once compared the Party's leadership to the nervous system, which leads all physiological functions. Of course, the nervous system does not directly replace the circulatory system, digestive system, respiratory system, muscular system, etc.

    Those who clamor that "laymen cannot lead experts" are also clamoring for "artists to return to the team" or "scientists to return to the team." They do not hesitate to contradict themselves. In my opinion, all cultural activities under the socialist system need "laymen" who have mastered Marxism-Leninism to lead. If there are shortcomings in leadership, it is because individual "laymen" have not yet mastered Marxism-Leninism well enough.

    4. How should the Party improve and strengthen its leadership over literary and artistic work?

    Answer: Flexibly grasp the six political criteria, resolutely implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, and the leadership of literary and artistic work will be better and stronger.

    In terms of promoting creative prosperity, Chairman Mao's instruction to "dismount and observe the flowers" should be implemented and promoted in an organized and planned manner. Without raw materials, soul engineers cannot produce any finished products.

    We must grasp the work of literary and artistic criticism. There are currently many literary and artistic publications, and one person does not have enough time to read them all. I think the Writers Association and local branches can organize criticism groups to conduct criticism on a monthly basis according to their division of labor. Excellent works should be especially encouraged, and they can be reprinted in central publications or published in special collections.

    We must grasp the work of translation. Translations must be especially processed. For example, the translation work in the Soviet Union goes through multiple procedures: a person who is proficient in foreign languages translates the first draft, and a writer or poet refines it. This method is worth learning from us. Reading translations is often a driving force for inspiring creation.

    I very much hope that there will be a "Selected Collection of Chinese Poetry and Prose Throughout the Ages," which should be selected very carefully and not be too much or too bad. Regardless of genre or style, add some appropriate explanations. This is enlightening for literary and artistic work, but it seems that no one is willing to start doing it yet. This probably also requires the establishment of a team to carry it out in order to be easily achieved.

### 彻底反击右派  郭沫若答“文艺报”记者问

    彻底反击右派
    郭沫若答“文艺报”记者问
    新华社15日讯　14日出版的第十五期“文艺报”发表了郭沫若答
  “文艺报”记者提出的四个问题，问题是“彻底反击右派”。全文如下：
    一、我们应该怎样加强战斗，才能取得反右派斗争的完全胜利？如何取得整风的预期效果？反右派斗争和整风的关系如何？
    答：目前反党、反社会主义的右派分子必须予以彻底的反击，丝毫不可放松。当然，反击的武器是真理和事实，同时也要揭露右派分子的虚伪和丑恶，剥夺他们的武器。这样，既打击了右派分子，也教育了非右派人士。
    右派和毒草一样，是不容易锄尽的。今后一切知识分子必须经常进行自我的政治教育和思想教育，以防止右倾思想的产生，才能获得
  “完全胜利”。任何人对于思想改造不能忽视，一刻也不能离开批评与自我批评的武器。
    在反击右派分子中，明辨是非、坚定立场，对于整风是有帮助的。整风必须“有错必纠”，不可讳疾忌医。善意的尖锐的批评应该诚恳地接受，不能与右派分子的进攻混同。
    反右派斗争是政治上和思想上的阶级斗争，整风是人民内部矛盾的调整，虽然同时在进行，但性质不同。
    但两者的作用是相互错综的。通过反击右派的坚决斗争可以帮助整风，通过严肃认真的整风可以和右派分子划清界限、增加我们的斗志。　
    右派分子的猖狂进攻，促进了我们提高警惕、加强团结、改进作风。从这一点来说，毒草和根翻过来，的确也就变成肥料了。
    二、有人说，自延安文艺座谈会后，我们的作品都是公式化、概念化的，思想性、艺术性都是不高的。应当怎样来驳斥这种荒谬论调？对我国社会主义文艺事业的成绩，你认为应当作怎样的估计？
    答：近年来我对于文艺作品看得很少，对于作品的全面性批评我很难回答。但有一点可以肯定地说，延安文艺座谈会后，创作实践得到了明确的指标，文学艺术的思想性是提高了。
    艺术性的高低，要看拿什么作为标准。如果是以解放前一般作品为标准，就我所接触到的新作品看来，我是觉得一般地是提高了，而非降低了。当然，足以和伟大时代相称的震烁古今的作品似乎还没有产生。但这样的作品解放前也没有。
    公式化、概念化的倾向可能是有的，但要说所有的作品都是公式化、概念化，那样的全面否定是不近情理的谰言。
    我们的社会主义文艺事业，随着社会主义建设的进展，随着作家生活经验日益积累、思想和技巧的日益精进，必然会日益磅礴发展。新的民族形式、前无古人的伟大创作必然会产生出来，这是毫无疑问的。
    三、有人说，党不能领导文艺，“外行不能领导内行”，同时，借作家的劳动特点和反对文艺领导的某些行政方式的缺点，而企图取消党对文艺工作的思想领导和组织领导。应当怎样粉碎这种谬论？
    答：“党不能领导X”，这是资产阶级右派分子向党和社会主义进攻的一个公式。这个X可以置换为“文艺”，可以置换为“科学”，可以置换为“教育”，甚至可以置换为“政治”。右派的理论和我们是正相反对的。因此，命题的正确性应该从反面去了解。“党不能领导X”这个公式，只消把“不”字删去，便一切都不成问题了。
    党是能领导文艺的。文艺的方向性、人民性、党性，没有党的领导是不行的。文艺家的培养、组织、鼓舞也都不能离开党的领导。
    为什么党能领导一切？就因为党是马克思列宁主义的党。马克思列宁主义是就具体情况进行具体分析而作具体领导的。
    我曾经把党的领导比作神经系统，一切生理机能都要受它的领导。当然，神经系统并不直接代替循环系统、消化系统、呼吸系统、筋肉系统等。
    叫嚷“外行不能领导内行”的人，同时又在叫嚷“文艺家归队”或“科学家归队”。他们是不惜自相矛盾的。在我看来，在社会主义制度下的一切文化活动都需要掌握了马克思列宁主义的“外行”来领导。如果领导上有缺点，那是个别“外行”还没有把马克思列宁主义掌握得好。
    四、党应该如何改善和加强对文艺工作的领导？
    答：灵活掌握六条政治标准，坚决贯彻“百花齐放”方针，文艺工作的领导便会更好、更强。
    从繁荣创作上来说，毛主席“下马观花”的指示是应该有组织有计划地来执行、推动的。没有原料，灵魂工程师们生产不出什么成品来。
    要抓紧文艺批评工作。目前文艺刊物很多，一个人没有那么多时间来看。我认为可由作家协会和各地分会组织批评小组，分工按月进行批评。对于优秀作品特别加以鼓励，可由中央刊物加以转载，或专出选集。
    要抓紧翻译工作。译文要特别加工，例如苏联的翻译工作是要经过多道手续的：由通外文者译出初稿，由作家或诗人来润色。这办法值得我们学习。读译文，每每是启发创作的动力。
    我很希望有一部“中国历代诗文选集”，要选得很精，不要太多太滥。不分体裁，不分文白，适当加些说明。这对于文艺工作是有启发作用的，目前似乎还没有人肯着手做。这恐怕也要成立一个小组来进行，才容易期成。
