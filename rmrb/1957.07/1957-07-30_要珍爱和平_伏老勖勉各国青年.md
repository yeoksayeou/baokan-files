Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th. Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, addressed the 30,000 young representatives from 122 countries at the opening ceremony of the Sixth World Youth Festival on July 28th, saying:

    Cherish peace. Unite your youthful strength to defend peace, strengthen friendship and mutual understanding among peoples, and strive for a bright future for all mankind!

    Voroshilov said: The great event of the festival has aroused special concern and great attention from the public around the world. This is easy to understand, because the purpose and content of the festival are lofty and bright, and it can be said that all kind people will feel close to it. You have come to participate in the festival and further strengthen brotherly friendship and mutual understanding through friendly meetings and exchanges of views. This will enable the youth of all countries to unite more closely. Therefore, you are making the most valuable contribution to the common noble cause of the people of all countries—consolidating world peace and friendship.

    Your decorations, your national costumes, your lively and cheerful faces have turned the Moscow stadium into a beautiful and colorful bouquet. At the sight of you, one wants to say: That beautiful spring has come to our ancient Moscow, to our land, for the second time this year.

    Voroshilov also spoke about the Soviet government and the Soviet people's love of peace. He said: Our great socialist country is engaged in constructive peaceful labor in order to further develop the national economy and culture and improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, the Soviet Union is willing to live in peace and friendship with all countries and peoples.

    You have come to participate in the festival from countries with different social systems, different beliefs, different religions, and different views. We welcome you equally. We believe that every nation has the right to arrange its own life according to its own wishes.

    We have never forced anyone, nor are we prepared to force anyone to accept our ideas and views. If the great socialist ideology has won in the course of historical development, and more and more countries and nations have embarked on the road of socialist development, the problem is certainly not in propaganda. This is the law of social and historical development, because socialism is the most progressive social system and the most in line with the needs and aspirations of the people of all countries.

    要珍爱和平
    伏老勖勉各国青年
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫7月28日在第六届世界青年联欢节开幕式上向一百二十二个国家的三万名青年代表致欢迎词说：
    要珍爱和平。为了保卫和平和加强各国人民的友谊和相互了解，把你们青年的力量团结起来，为全人类美好的未来而奋斗！
    伏罗希洛夫说：联欢节这个伟大事件引起了全世界公众特别的关切和很大的注意。这是很容易理解的。因为联欢节的目的和内容是崇高而光明的，可以说所有善良的人都会感到亲切的。你们来参加联欢节，通过友好的会见和互相交换意见的办法来进一步加强兄弟友谊和相互了解。这样就能够使世界各国的青年更紧密地团结在一起。因此，你们对各国人民共同的崇高事业——巩固世界和平和友谊的事业做出了最有价值的贡献。
    你们的装饰打扮，你们的民族服装，你们的活泼愉快的面容把莫斯科运动场变成了美丽鲜艳的花束。一看见你们就想要说：那美好的春天今年第二度降临了我们古老的莫斯科，降临了我们的大地。
    伏罗希洛夫还谈到了苏联政府和苏联人民对和平的热爱。他说：我们伟大的社会主义国家正在从事建设性的和平劳动，以求进一步发展国民经济和文化，提高人民的生活水平。因此，苏联愿意同各个国家和各国人民和平友好地相处。
    你们从具有不同社会制度、不同信仰、不同宗教和观点的国家前来参加联欢节。我们一视同仁地欢迎你们。我们认为，每个民族都有权按照自己的愿望安排自己的生活。
    我们从来没有强迫过谁，而且也不准备强迫谁接受我们的思想和观点。如果说，在历史发展过程中伟大的社会主义思想获得了胜利，越来越多的国家和民族走上了社会主义发展道路，问题当然不在于宣传。这是社会历史发展的规律，因为社会主义是最进步的社会制度，是最符合各国人民的需要和愿望的。（附图片）
