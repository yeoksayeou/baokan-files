Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 16th. President Mirza of Pakistan issued an order on the 15th to end the presidential rule over West Pakistan, and the Republican Party government of that province has resumed its functions.

The direct presidential rule over West Pakistan began on March 21st of this year. At that time, the opposition Muslim League tried its best to overthrow the Republican Party government in West Pakistan, which caused political turmoil.

It is reported that the West Pakistan Republican Party government will be reorganized soon. This government must face the provincial legislative assembly within two months. The Muslim League is concentrating its efforts to defeat the Republican Party when the legislative assembly meets.

The political situation in East Pakistan is also changing. Many leaders of the East Pakistan People's League have withdrawn from the party because they are dissatisfied with the East Pakistan People's League Committee's resolution supporting Suhrawardy's pro-Western foreign policy. They expressed their support for Maulana Bhashani's meeting in Dhaka on July 24th to discuss the possibility of forming a new All-Pakistan political party.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 17th. The results of Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to the United States have not caused a warm reaction here.

The "Karachi Times" editorial on the 16th stated that the US-Pakistan joint communique was "very disappointing." "What is noteworthy about this communique is its empty content."

Suhrawardy's visit came at a time when Pakistan is facing two serious problems: economic difficulties and political instability. Pakistan has always hoped to obtain more US aid and US support on the Kashmir issue and the river water dispute with India. However, politicians here have noticed that Suhrawardy did not reach any specific agreements with the US government in the United States.

A "Pakistan Times" editorial stated, "The Prime Minister's efforts to please his Western friends will inevitably not improve his position among his own people; unless he can show in the near future that Pakistan can expect to obtain definite political benefits as a reward for the government's pro-Western stance, the people will reject this policy and abandon those who implement this policy with extreme enthusiasm."

    东西巴基斯坦政局在变动中
    巴舆论对美巴会谈结果感到失望
    新华社卡拉奇16日电  巴基斯坦总统米尔扎15日下令结束对西巴基斯坦的总统统治，这个省的共和党政府已经恢复了职权。
    对西巴基斯坦实行总统的直接统治是在今年3月21日开始的。当时由于在野的穆斯林联盟竭力要推翻西巴基斯坦的共和党政府而造成了政治上的混乱局面。
    据报道，西巴基斯坦共和党政府将在最近改组。这个政府必须在两个月内面对省立法会议。穆斯林联盟正在集中力量，准备在立法会议开会时击败共和党。
    东巴基斯坦的政局也在变化中。东巴基斯坦人民联盟许多领袖已经退党，因为他们不满东巴基斯坦人民联盟委员会支持苏拉瓦底的亲西方外交政策的决议。他们表示支持大毛拉巴沙尼在7月24日在达卡召开会议，讨论组织一个新的全巴基斯坦政党的可能性问题。
    新华社卡拉奇17日电  巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底访问美国的结果没有在这里引起热烈的反应。
    “卡拉奇时报”16日的社论说，美巴联合公报“非常令人失望”。“关于这个公报值得注意的是它的空洞的内容。”
    苏拉瓦底的访问正是在巴基斯坦面临着经济困难和政治不稳定两个严重的问题的时候。巴基斯坦一直希望得到更多的美国援助，并且在克什米尔问题和同印度的河道用水争端上得到美国的支持。但是，这里的政界人士注意到，苏拉瓦底在美国并没有和美国政府达成任何具体的协议。
    “巴基斯坦时报”一篇社论说，“总理卖力讨好他的西方朋友，在他自己的人民中间必然不会提高他的地位；除非他能够在不久的将来显示出巴基斯坦可望得到确定的政治上的利益，作为对政府站在亲西方一边的报答，否则人民将拒绝这种政策，并且会抛弃那些极为狂热地执行这种政策的人。”
