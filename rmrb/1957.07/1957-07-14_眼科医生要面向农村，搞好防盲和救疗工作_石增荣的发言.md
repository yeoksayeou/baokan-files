From learning about the Soviet Union's experience in preventing blindness, I learned that before the October Socialist Revolution, there were about twenty blind people per 10,000 residents in the Soviet Union, and in the forty years since, this has been reduced to three.

Although the ophthalmological facilities in our country's big cities are acceptable, the vast rural areas lack ophthalmologists, resulting in a high prevalence of trachoma among farmers, and other eye diseases are also left untreated, leading to many double-blind people unable to engage in production. According to our recent survey in Heilongjiang Province, which involved a household-by-household investigation of 200,000 residents in eighteen counties: there are about 41 to 516 blind people per 10,000 people. If we use the average of 100, then our province's 10 million farmers have 100,000 double-blind people, of which more than half can be treated, and most of them are middle-aged and young people who can return to the production front after treatment. This work is not difficult. Over the past eight years, our province has used the medical organizations of various counties to transfer some doctors or medical assistants for training, organizing a total of eleven blindness prevention training classes and refresher courses, training more than 300 people, and establishing ENT or ophthalmology departments in more than 40 of the province's 60+ counties. Since the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1956, the Provincial Health Department has incorporated blindness prevention work into administrative planning, shifting from local pilot projects to a comprehensive approach, combining investigation, treatment, and personnel training, while establishing a blindness prevention organization network in various counties, and training doctors in district health centers and health workers in cooperatives. Therefore, our blindness prevention work has begun to move onto a new track. At least, we plan to first eliminate severe trachoma and liberate treatable blind eye diseases in our province's rural areas during the transition period, laying a favorable foundation for further prevention and treatment of trachoma and changing the overall face of eye diseases in the future.

Nationally, Xiangtan People's Hospital in Hunan Province has also conducted in-depth investigations and treatments in rural areas, finding that in a certain mountainous area with poverty and water shortage, there were about 500 blind people per 10,000 residents, while in the county's suburban areas with convenient transportation and better living conditions, there were 230. From this, we can infer that most rural residents have not been able to connect with medical institutions in large cities and play their due role. If we calculate based on the standard of Heilongjiang Province for the 500 million rural laborers nationwide, there are 5 million blind people. If we use the standard of suburban Xiangtan County, there are more than 10 million. The rural people are unable to afford treatment in big cities, both in terms of knowledge and economics. Although the government has called for the prevention and treatment of trachoma today, it cannot completely provide free treatment, nor can it be forced upon them. Therefore, only under the conditions of combining need and possibility can we liberate more blind people, turning consumers into grain producers for the country. Moreover, due to the effects of regaining sight, the rural people are happy to accept health propaganda. According to the feedback from the rural people heard by the staff who actually participated in the work: Only in today's China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will doctors go to the countryside. Therefore, I hope that ophthalmologists across the country will bravely participate and devote some of their efforts to go deep into the countryside and strive to do a good job in the blindness prevention work competition!

Next, let's talk about treatment work: Blindness examination must be combined with treatment; otherwise, the rural people will not welcome it. All propaganda methods are, of course, necessary, but the most effective is still the treatment effect. Quick and significant surgeries such as cataract and trichiasis are most necessary. Over the past eight years, Harbin Medical University has taken advantage of the slack farming season during winter and summer vacations to go to the countryside, performing a total of 8,000 surgeries, plus about 20,000 surgeries performed by various counties themselves. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 people have regained their sight. It is estimated that in the next eleven years, there will be approximately 50,000 treatable blind people in our province, most of whom will be rescued. As a result of prevention and treatment, the overall picture of blind eye diseases will change. According to the records of the Soviet scholar Grovin, blindness caused by trachoma corneal softening, cataracts, and smallpox is 100% preventable and treatable, while eye trauma, glaucoma, pterygium, syphilis, etc., account for about one-third. According to his calculation method, about 80% of China's blind eye diseases can be included in the category of preventable and treatable. Therefore, it is necessary for us to first do a good job in this basic work, that is, to improve on the basis of popularization, and then to popularize on the basis of improvement.

We must mobilize all positive factors and try our best to turn negative factors into positive factors. Although all counties across the country have medical facilities, they are limited to internal medicine and surgery, while ENT is still a blank space. We have a responsibility to help establish ENT or ophthalmology departments by means of transferring and giving refresher courses, holding centralized training classes, or conducting on-the-spot blindness examination and treatment while training personnel, so that they can become specialists, and we can stipulate that they carry out one to two blindness prevention month work every year, go to the countryside for mobile diagnosis and treatment during the busy farming season, and train doctors in outer districts and health workers in cooperatives. Ophthalmology clinics in large cities should also be mobilized to assist factory and school medical staff in carrying out the prevention and treatment of trachoma and injury prevention, and provide rural people with good, economical, fast, and planned treatment work.

Since the call to march towards science was issued, will more doctors and students be envious of the idea of staying in big cities and leaving their posts to engage in research (associate doctorate)? See how the Chinese Medical Association favors large cities in absorbing members, emphasizing the level of scientific research, and restricting membership qualifications, while neglecting the popularization and improvement of good work in various outer cities and counties. In the past few years, the number of medical and health facilities in factories, mines, and rural areas has indeed greatly increased, but the only flaw is that the effect of playing a role has not yet caught up with the requirements. In fact, for this aspect of work, such as eliminating the most common and endemic diseases that are most harmful to the people, it is both urgently needed by the people and conducive to increasing production. In the future, more attention should be paid to popularizing and improving the quality of work, which is really urgent. The Central Ministry of Health and the Chinese Medical Association have a responsibility to face up to these tasks! For example, medical colleges and schools in various provinces should cooperate well with practical teaching work, place emphasis on the collaborative system when marching towards science, lay a solid foundation for students' internship bases, make good contact with the introduction of patients with teaching significance, lay a good foundation for collective scientific research, earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's upper-level hospitals to help lower-level hospitals to cultivate work, and devote some efforts to make up for deficiencies and engage in refresher courses. Various provinces should establish local medical associations or expand local organizations of the Chinese Medical Association to facilitate the popularization and improvement of work.

Finally, let's talk about learning Chairman Mao's correct handling of contradictions among the people. My experience is that when learning from the advanced experience of various countries, especially the Soviet Union, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Think about it when you learn, learn those things that are suitable for our country's conditions, that is, absorb experience that is beneficial to us," which is very necessary. We must know that we are a poor country with a population of 600 million and a backward economy. To make it prosperous, we must follow the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, and it will take decades of hard work to achieve it. Therefore, we cannot ask for too much.

Scientific workers should implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, but they must profoundly understand Chairman Mao's six criteria, especially the two most important items: taking the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. We non-Party members should not only improve our understanding and draw a clear line with the Rightists, and make a resolute struggle, but also automatically participate in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, especially like us intellectuals in leading positions. If we don't do this, we may suppress new forces and reasonable suggestions in socialist construction, which is still common. Even if it is not due to intentional suppression, but simply due to unclear discrimination, it will hinder the growth of new things. Therefore, we should maintain a cautious attitude in science, advocate free discussion, and not make conclusions rashly. Such an attitude can help science develop smoothly.

Learning Premier Zhou's instructions, we have clarified that the basic task of scientific and technological research is to develop production and fight against nature, not to conduct research for the sake of research, not to prioritize trivial matters over urgent ones, not to engage in a single set, but to implement the principles of collaboration, increasing production and saving resources.

### 眼科医生要面向农村，搞好防盲和救疗工作  石增荣的发言

    眼科医生要面向农村，搞好防盲和救疗工作
    石增荣的发言
    我从学习苏联防治盲人工作的经验中，得知苏联在十月社会主义革命前，一万名居民中约有二十名盲人，迄今四十年来已减少到三名。
    我们国家大城市眼科设施虽尚可，但广大农村因为没有眼科医生，农民砂眼特多，及其他各种眼病亦均未受治疗，以致有很多不能从事生产的双目盲人。据我们黑龙江省最近在十八个县二十万多居民中按人逐户调查的结果：每万人中约有四十一至五百一十六名之多，如以其平均概数为一百计算，则我省一千万农民即有十万双目盲人，此中约半数以上可救治，且其中大部分系中壮年人，救治后可重上生产战线。这一工作并不如何之难，我省八年来曾利用各县的医疗组织抽调部分医师或医士加以训练，共组织防盲训练班及进修班十一次，培训了三百余人次，给省内六十多个县中之四十多个县建立了五官科或眼科。省卫生厅自一九五六年农业合作化高潮以来，将防盲工作纳入行政规划，由局部试点工作开始转入全面，边调查、边治疗、边培干，同时建立各县防盲机构网，培养区卫生所医生及合作社卫生员等。所以说我们的防盲工作至此已开始走上新的轨道，至少计划在过渡期间在我省农村先消灭重砂眼，解放可救治的盲眼病症，给今后进一步的防治砂眼、改变眼症全体面貌打下有利基础。
    全国方面，如湖南湘潭人民医院也曾深入农村调查治疗，发现在贫困缺水之某一山区居民，万人中约五百名，而于该县之交通便利、生活较好的郊区则为二百三十名，由此可推测大多数地区的老乡们还未能与大城市医疗机构起到联系，发挥应有的作用。全国五亿农村劳动人民，如以黑龙江省之标准计算，则有五百万盲人，以湘潭县郊区为标准，则为一千余万。老乡们无论在知识和经济方面多是无力到大城市医治的。今天政府虽已号召防治砂眼，但是既不能完全免费治疗，也不能强迫命令，所以只有在需要与可能相结合的条件下，多多解放盲人，给国家变消费者为增产粮食的生产者，并且由于复明效果，老乡们乐于接受卫生宣传。据各位实地参加工作的人员听到老乡们反映：只有在共产党和毛主席领导的今天，医生才会下乡。因此，希望全国各地的眼科同道们，奋勇参加，抽出部分力量深入农村，为搞好防盲工作竞赛而努力吧！
    次谈救疗工作：检盲必须配合治疗，否则老乡是不会欢迎的。一切的宣传方法当然是必须的，但最有效的还是在于治疗效果。如白内障、倒睫等，生效快而显著的手术最为必要。八年来哈尔滨医学院每年利用冬暑假教学不忙之农闲期下乡，共施手术八千来次，加上各县自己所作的约计两万多次。据不完全统计，约复明万名以上。预计今后十一年内我省约计五万名可救治的盲人，其中之大部分将有被救治出来的可能。由于防治的结果，盲眼病症的全貌，将会因之发生改变。如据苏联葛罗汶氏记述，由于砂眼角膜软化症、白内障、天然痘而盲的是百分之百可防治的，眼外伤、青光眼、翼状胬肉、梅毒等也约在三分之一以上。按他的计算法，我国的盲眼病症约有百分之八十可列入可预防、可救治之内的，所以说我们有必要先将这一基本工作搞好，即在普及基础之上来提高，然后再在提高的基础之上再普及。
    我们要调动一切积极因素，并且尽可能地将消极因素变为积极因素。全国各县虽已有了医疗设施，但是止于内外科而已，五官科尚属空白，我们有责任用抽调进修、集中开训练班或者就地检盲治盲同时培干的办法，帮助建立五官科或眼科，使之成为专科医生，并可规定每年开展一至二次防盲月工作，在农忙时期下乡巡回诊疗，并培养外区医生及合作社卫生员工作。大城市各眼科诊疗单位也要一齐动员起来，协助厂、校医务人员开展防治砂眼及防伤工作，并为老乡们作到好、省、快有计划性的治疗工作。
    自从向科学进军的号召发布以来，是否会有更多的医生和学员们羡慕留在大城市离开岗位生产工作专搞研究（副博士）的想法呢？看中华医学会偏重大城市吸收会员，强调科学研究水平，限制会员资格，而忽视了各外市、县的普及提高搞好岗位工作。几年来医药卫生设施无论在工厂、矿山、农村数量上确实有了巨大发展，不过美中不足，对于发挥作用上还远未能赶上要求而已。其实对于这一方面的工作，如消灭对国民危害最大的多发病、地方病，既属人民迫切需要，又利于增产。今后多注意普及提高质量工作，实属刻不容缓。中央卫生部和中华医学会有责任正视这些工作！例如各省医学院、校为了很好的配合实际作好教学工作，向科学进军应置于重协作制度，给学员的实习基地打好基础，给介绍有教学意义的病人作好联系，给集体科学研究打好基础，认真学习苏联上级医院帮助下级医院作培养工作，拿出部分力量作补修及进修工作，各省成立地方医学会或扩大中华医学会地方组织，便于作好普及提高工作。
    最后谈谈学习毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。我的体会在学习各国先进经验尤其是苏联经验时，我们必须按照毛主席指出的：“学习的时候用脑筋想一下，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西，即吸取对我们有益的经验”，这是十分必要的，须知我们是有六亿人口经济落后的穷国，要使之富强起来，必须本着勤俭建国的方针，经过几十年艰苦奋斗的时间才能作到，因此不能要求过高。
    科学工作者们应该执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，但必须深刻体会毛主席的指示六条标准，尤其最重要的是走社会主义道路和党的领导两项。我们党外人士不但要提高认识与右派划清界线，作坚决的斗争，并应该自动参加反对主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义，尤其像我们身居领导地位的知识分子，不这样作我们很可能在社会主义建设中，压抑新生力量，压抑合理的建议，这仍然是常有的事。即使不是由于有意压抑，只是由于鉴别不清，也会妨碍新生事物的成长。因此在科学上应当保持慎重态度，提倡自由讨论，不要轻率的作结论，这样的态度是可以帮助科学得到顺利发展的。
    学习周总理的指示，明确了科学技术研究工作的基本任务是为了发展生产，同自然界作斗争，不是为研究而研究，不分轻重缓急，不是单搞一套，而是要贯彻协作、增产节约的原则。
