Where Should Intellectuals Go in the Storm of Struggle?
Yang Dongchun's Speech

I would like to discuss the ideological remolding of intellectuals in connection with the anti-Rightist struggle.

The broad and profound anti-Rightist struggle that has unfolded over the past month or so is a class struggle of right and wrong between bourgeois Rightists and the entire people; it is a class struggle unfolding simultaneously on the political and ideological fronts. The contradiction composed of this major right and wrong has two aspects: it has an antagonistic aspect, and also a non-antagonistic aspect. If it is not handled appropriately, or if vigilance is lost, and there is numbness and carelessness, antagonism may occur. This is because this major right and wrong involves a significant and wide-ranging political topic: whether or not to have the leadership of the Communist Party and whether or not to have socialism. This issue is related to the fate of our country and the entire nation, and to the personal interests of everyone, including every intellectual. Therefore, everyone must clearly express their attitude in this struggle and test their position in the storm of struggle.

Some Kind People Have Lost Control of Their Souls

It should be said that the revolutionary, patriotic, and leftist intellectuals have performed well in this struggle; they breathe the same air and share the same fate with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and they have risen up with righteous indignation to counterattack the bourgeois Rightists. But it is worth noting that a considerable number of intellectuals, including many kind and upright people, have adopted a non-active attitude towards this struggle: their solemn attitude is quite different from that of the broad masses of workers and peasants; some of them are indifferent to the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds of the bourgeois Rightists, believing that this struggle has nothing to do with them; some of them resonate with and sympathize with the Rightists' remarks; when the "People's Daily" wrote editorials supporting the workers, peasants, and leftists in their counterattack against the Rightists, the workers, peasants, and leftists cheered and applauded, while some of them said that "the editorials were published too early," and even said that "the editorials were too harsh in their criticism of the Rightists"; some of them were vague and evasive in this struggle; some of them had a feeling of bewilderment, and their souls lost control, as if they were suspended by a thin thread in the high altitude; some of them adopted a reserved, wait-and-see, or even resistant attitude towards this struggle. These situations have changed somewhat with the deepening of the anti-Rightist struggle and the further exposure of the shocking words and actions of the Rightists against communism and socialism. Many people have recognized the nature of this struggle and its serious political consequences, and have therefore risen up and joined the battle. However, in any case, the before and after of this struggle have fully exposed the ideological confusion in intellectual circles. We live and work in intellectual circles, and I myself am considered an intellectual, and I cannot but feel heavy-hearted about this situation, and I cannot but explore the root causes of this situation.

Why Were They Intoxicated by the Rightists' Soup of Confusion? The Reason Must Be Found in the Weaknesses of the Intellectuals Themselves

It should be said that in the past seven years, under the guidance of the Party's policy of "unity, education, and transformation," relying on the leadership, care, and help of Party organizations at all levels, and relying on the intellectuals' own subjective and conscious efforts, the ideological level of intellectuals has been improved. They have distinguished between the enemy and ourselves and stood on the side of the people; they have contributed their own intelligence and wisdom to our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction; some of them, through hard study and practical exercise, have gradually mastered the Marxist-Leninist worldview, and have basically adapted to the change in their social and political status, and have become members of the working class vanguard - glorious Communist Party members. We believe that this progress of intellectuals should be sufficiently estimated, and the progress of intellectual circles should not be dismissed and completely denied because of the ideological confusion that has appeared in this anti-Rightist struggle. However, sufficient estimation should mean a realistic estimation, and should not be embellishing the intellectuals with embellishments. The problem now is that many intellectuals overestimate their progress. In the socialist revolution, the issue of clearly stating one's position has not been well resolved, but some people have been ill-intentioned in pleasing and flattering intellectuals, advocating that "the ideological remolding of intellectuals has now entered the issue of detailed viewpoints and methods" (Fei Xiaotong: "Before and After Early Spring"). Clearly, many intellectuals still lack a full sense of ownership of our country's affairs, but some people are harboring ulterior motives in encouraging intellectuals not to be "Mao Sui who stands out," but to be "Zhuge Liang waiting to be visited in Longzhong" (Luo Longji: speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Second CPPCC National Committee). Clearly, intellectuals have not yet well understood the relationship between the individual and the collective, and have not well understood the truth that a drop of water can only never dry up if it is placed in the vast ocean, but some people are viciously encouraging the megalomania of intellectuals, saying that "ten university professors can be worth 100,000 masses" (Luo Longji). These remarks by intellectuals with ulterior motives who are cocky towards the Party and the people have spread widely and deeply poisoned the intellectual circles, so that many people have been poured into a soup of confusion by them, mistakenly believing that ideological remolding is almost complete, the demand for "a room, two books" has come out, and the strange theory that "Marxism-Leninism is not working" has also come out. Naturally, it is still not comprehensive to blame these wolf-hearted intellectuals, external causes can only play a role through internal causes, therefore, the phenomenon of intellectual circles overestimating ideological progress should also be sought and explored from the weaknesses of the intellectuals themselves. In recent years, I have been working in universities and studying with many senior intellectuals, and I have become accustomed to hearing a saying of "taking a step forward." That is to say, whenever a study movement is about to end, people always like to say when writing study summaries or talking about study experiences (or are obsessed with overestimating their achievements and say without thinking), "Through this study, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward." For example: "Through the study of the land reform documents, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward"; "Through the study of the documents of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward"; "Through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries movement, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward"; "Through the ideological remolding movement, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward"; "Through the study of the general line documents, the Constitution documents, the documents of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, 'The Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,' the 'Eighth National Congress' documents, 'On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Again,' the transmission of the Ten Major Relationships report, my understanding and thinking have taken a step forward," and so on. It should be said that people have indeed made some progress through such a series of studies; it should also be said that the improvement of people's ideological understanding is indeed to be taken step by step and gradually. However, strangely enough, taking a step forward and then taking a step forward, when it comes to the anti-Rightist struggle, the result is equivalent to being hit by a "sap," even the six political criteria are not bottomed out in the heart, and they fall heavily from the high place, plummeting, and turning back to complain that "the speaker is innocent," complaining that the Party did not give a prior notice and reveal the six political criteria (this refers to the well-meaning intellectuals, the Rightists are not included). In addition to overestimating the achievements of ideological remolding, overestimating the improvement of one's own ideological understanding, and not deeply combining one's own flesh and blood in each study, can any other explanation be found? In short, the ideological confusion in intellectual circles revealed by this anti-Rightist struggle suggests to us that the ideological remolding of intellectuals has achievements, but the intellectuals themselves overestimate these achievements, so that they cannot but accept a great and painful lesson in the face of reality!

The Party Has Always Had a Fair Estimate and Clear Instructions on Intellectuals

So, what does the Party think about this issue?

As early as January of last year, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in the "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals": "The face of intellectual circles in our country has undergone fundamental changes in the past six years." But the "Report" then went on to point out: "The ideological state of intellectuals is not fully adapted to the changes in their political and social status." "In our enterprises, schools, organs, and in society, there are still such intellectuals: they do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and between the Chinese people and imperialism; they are not satisfied with the policies and measures of the Party and the People's Government, and are nostalgic for capitalism or even feudalism; they oppose the Soviet Union and are unwilling to learn from the Soviet Union; they refuse to study Marxism-Leninism and slander Marxism-Leninism; they despise labor, despise the working people, despise the cadres from the working people, and are unwilling to approach the workers and peasants and the worker-peasant cadres; they are unwilling to see the growth of new forces, and think that the progressive elements are speculators; they not only often create disputes and oppositions between intellectuals and the Party, but also create disputes and oppositions among intellectuals; they are arrogant, think they are the best in the world, and cannot accept the leadership and criticism of anyone; they deny the interests of the people and the interests of society, and look at all issues from the perspective of personal interests, and approve what is in their own interests and oppose what is not in their own interests." Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai said in the "Report": "Continuing to help intellectuals carry out self-transformation is one of the important political tasks of the Party in the transition period." From Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Issue of Intellectuals," it can be clearly seen that the Party has sufficient estimates of the progress of intellectuals, the Party has a clear understanding of the existing shortcomings and weaknesses of intellectuals, and the Party also has clear instructions on the task of ideological remolding of intellectuals in the future. The Party's view is realistic and fair and appropriate. Comparing the words and deeds of the bourgeois Rightists and the ideological confusion of general intellectuals today, we feel on the one hand the foresight of the Party's leadership and the correctness of the Party's policies; on the other hand, we also feel that our intellectuals have failed to live up to the Party's ardent expectations, "still as before," have not made much progress, and we should report to the Party with a guilty conscience.

Why Has the Ideological Remolding of Intellectuals Not Been As Good As Expected? The Most Fundamental Reason Is That They Have Not Undergone Severe Tests in the Fiery Mass Struggle

Now we should ask: Why has the ideological remolding of our intellectuals not been as good as expected? Why have our positions not been changed? Why is the ideology of intellectual circles so confused in the anti-Rightist struggle?

I think the most fundamental reason is that our intellectuals have not undergone practical training, and have not withstood severe tests in the fiery mass struggle. Although the ideological remolding movement in 1952 was somewhat intense, the political situation at that time gave the purpose of the ideological remolding movement only to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and to stand on the side of the people. In the socialist revolution stage, the social and political situation requires the intellectuals to have not the general position of the people, but the socialist, working-class position. In the socialist revolution, we adopted a peaceful transformation, a non-bloody approach. The great changes in the relations of production and the great changes in people's material and cultural lives have caused strong and far-reaching shocks in the minds and lifestyles of the broad masses of people, but the impact on intellectual circles seems to be smaller. A smaller impact is not necessarily a good phenomenon, because this will affect the change in the position of intellectual circles to a certain extent. Intellectual circles that have not experienced wind, frost, rain, and snow, that have not undergone profound shocks, and that have not changed their positions, once they are thrown into the turbulent new life, cannot but feel unaccustomed, uncoordinated, unfamiliar, and unadapted at all times and everywhere.

Why Did the Stinking Speeches of Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong Resonate With Many Intellectuals? No Other Reason, They Share the Same Smell, Sound the Same, and Have Similar Positions

It is precisely because the intellectual circles have relaxed ideological remolding in the fiery struggle and relaxed the change of position in the socialist revolution stage that the Zhang-Luo alliance extended its clutches into this "fertile land" and cultivated poisonous seedlings and poisonous weeds on this "fertile land." That is to say, taking intellectual circles as a "stepping stone" and as their dreamed "political capital" and "mass base" to carry out the evil activities of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism.

It is precisely because the intellectual circles have relaxed ideological remolding in the fiery struggle and relaxed the change of position in the socialist revolution stage, their immunity is not strong, and their resistance is not strong, that the stinking articles of Luo Longji, Fei Xiaotong, and others have actually resonated with some people in the intellectual circles. Luo Longji shamelessly regarded himself as the "spokesperson" of intellectuals, and his speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Second CPPCC National Committee was essentially an anti-Party, challenging "ultimatum" to the Party. It is easy for discerning people to find the meaning of this speech, that is: on the one hand, to coerce the Party, on the other hand, to win over some backward intellectuals, to ask them to be content with backwardness, not to care about the fate of the motherland, not to care about the fate of socialism, and not to have any sense of ownership for the national economy and the people's livelihood, only to wait for the Communist Party to "respect the virtuous and condescend to the wise" and "visit the thatched cottage three times." Fei Xiaotong's "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" and "Before and After Early Spring" are two articles with hidden malicious intentions, burying chicken bones in every word and sentence, and mixing arsenic in every line and paragraph. On the one hand, he poured out his decadent emotions of the end of the bourgeois century, talking about his own adaptation to the relationship between "physique" and "climate," in order to infect those intellectuals who still have a sense of loneliness in the great era; on the other hand, he unscrupulously incited people to uncover the lid: first uncover the lid of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and then uncover the lid of "mutual supervision." He does not advocate "to uncover or not to uncover," but advocates "it is better to uncover early than to uncover late, it is better to uncover a little than to uncover a lot, it is better to uncover it than to break it open." If people compare his call in "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" for intellectuals to "give full play to their political enthusiasm" in the season of "spring warmth and flowers blooming," and the imposing posture in "Before and After Early Spring" that he wants to "break open" the "lid," with the fact that the core backbone of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightists set fires everywhere and attacked the Party, it can be seen that Fei Xiaotong's intentions are sinister. A speech and two articles appeared on the eve of the anti-Rightist struggle. Originally, through the paper, people can see the faces of the Rightists; by carefully examining their words and writings, people can also smell some of the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist smell of the Rightists. However, intellectuals did not do so, and many intellectuals were cheering for Luo Longji's sour and moldy speech of "buying people's hearts," and many intellectuals were cheering for Fei Xiaotong's two "miscellaneous essays" that specialize in singing the opposite tune. Why? No other reason, they share the same smell, sound the same, and have similar positions. After people have exposed the ferocious faces of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other Rightists, how should those intellectuals who cheered and applauded place themselves? Besides strengthening their own ideological remolding, exercising their own positions, and improving their own revolutionary sense of smell and revolutionary vigilance, what other way can there be?

After the Ugly Faces of the Zhang-Luo Alliance Are Exposed, What Should Those "Well-Meaning" Intellectuals Do? It Is Impossible to See the Path Clearly Without Removing the Veil of Sentimentality

Now, people should have reason to ask further: After the ugly faces of the Zhang-Luo alliance are exposed, what should those "well-meaning" intellectuals do?

I think the best way is to roll up your sleeves, resolutely tear up their dirty faces, and resolutely smash their stinking shelves, so that people can see: what kind of stuff is this after all! Some people say that their hands are soft, and they can't do it. Why are your hands soft? Why can't you do it? One is because people are familiar with each other, everyone has been together for many years, and faces are in the way; one is because these people have some "talent," don't make it too difficult for them, and you have to leave some room for them to make amends to the people after they repent. What a face of sentimentality! You are familiar with Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc., and you have friendship with them. If you don't fight them, they are anti-communist and anti-socialist. Where do you put the 600 million people? You have deep feelings for this group of people and few feelings for the 600 million people. What is this position? Qian Weichang, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, and other small handful of arrogant anti-Party and anti-socialist British and American students do have "talent" and "learning," and they are indeed high, deep, and broad, but they have different ambitions, and it is useless to the people for their great "talent" and wide "learning." If you resolutely fight them as Rightists, if they can change their minds, wash their hearts, face the people, and work for the people, then they will be considered friends, and they will be righteous, and it will be beneficial to the people. Otherwise, such sentimentality, reflected in politics, can only be a kind of liberalism without right or wrong. I often think about some issues in the battle to join the anti-Rightist struggle. When I discovered that Fei Xiaotong, this "scholar," was also using the guise of "sentimentality" to cover up the reactionary words and deeds of the Zhang-Luo alliance and its core small group, I suddenly realized: It turns out that "sentimentality" has such a wide range of "uses"! This makes me vigilant and deeply realize that the wolf whose wildness is difficult to tame will always eat people, and raising wolves will cause trouble; if the Rightists are not hit hard and resolutely, the harm is also endless. Without removing the veil of sentimentality, what kind of political position do you use to participate in this anti-Rightist struggle?

To sum up: From the ideological confusion revealed by intellectuals in the anti-Rightist struggle, from the current situation where intellectuals overestimate their progress, from the Party's analysis of the shortcomings of intellectuals, from the possibility that intellectuals may be used as "stepping stones" by political careerists, from the sentimentality shown by intellectuals in the anti-Rightist struggle, etc., all fundamentally illustrate a problem: All progressive, kind, upright, patriotic, and revolutionary intellectuals must learn from Lu Xun, make the determination of a strong man to break his wrist, ruthlessly dissect themselves, and under the leadership of the Party, in the mass struggle against the Rightists, strengthen ideological remolding, and change their position and worldview. For intellectuals, the great exposure of ideological confusion in intellectual circles in the anti-Rightist struggle is indeed a very painful lesson. If you can feel this pain, learn from the lesson, continue to move forward, and strengthen ideological remolding, you can feel the joy of being reborn, otherwise, if you fall behind one step, you will not be able to keep up with a hundred steps.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, and gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian, communist worldview. The change in worldview is a fundamental change, and most intellectuals cannot yet say that they have completed this change. We hope that the intellectuals in our country will continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist worldview in the process of their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually become one with the workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone regress backward, and there is no way out for backward."

Chairman Mao's words are earnest! We should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely implement the Party's instructions. Follow Chairman Mao and follow the Party. Only by actively participating in the anti-Rightist struggle, actively transforming our own thinking, and fundamentally solving the issue of position, can we wholeheartedly serve the people better.

专栏：

    知识分子在斗争风暴中何去何从？
    杨东莼的发言
    我想联系反右派斗争，谈谈知识分子的思想改造问题。
    一个多月来展开的广泛深刻的反右派斗争，是资产阶级右派分子和全体人民之间的一种大是大非的阶级斗争，是在政治战线上和思想战线上同时展开的阶级斗争。这种大是非组成的矛盾是有两面性的，它既有对抗性的一面，也有非对抗性的一面，如果处理得不适当，或者失去警觉，麻痹大意，也可能发生对抗。其所以如此，是因为这个大是非，牵涉到一个性质重大、范围广泛的政治题目，即：要不要共产党的领导和要不要社会主义的问题。这个问题关联到我们国家和全民族的命运，关联到每一个人，包括每一个知识分子的切身利益。因此，每一个人都必须在这场斗争中鲜明地表示态度，在斗争的风暴中检验自己的立场。
    有些善良的人神魂失去了主宰
    应该说，革命的、爱国的左派知识分子，在这一场斗争中是表现得好的，他们和广大工农群众同呼吸、共命运，义愤填膺地起来反击资产阶级右派。但值得注意的是，知识分子里边相当大的一部分人，其中包括许多善良正直的人，对这场斗争却采取了不是积极的态度：他们和广大工农群众所表示的严正态度有相当大的距离；他们当中有些人对资产阶级右派反共、反人民、反社会主义的言行无动于衷，认为这场斗争与自己无关；他们当中有些人对右派的言论起共鸣，表同情；当“人民日报”撰写社论支持工农群众和左派反击右派的时候，工农群众和左派人士无不拍手称快，而他们当中有些人却说“社论发表得太早了”，甚至说“社论对右派的反批评太过火了”；他们当中有些人在这场斗争中含含糊糊、躲躲闪闪；他们当中有些人有一种迷惘的感觉，神魂失去了主宰，似乎自己被一条纤细的丝线吊悬在万仞高空；他们当中有些人对这场斗争采取保留、观望甚至抵触的态度。这些情况，随着反右派斗争的深入开展，随着右派分子反共、反社会主义的怵目惊心的言论行动的进一步揭露，已经有所扭转。许多人已经认识这场斗争的性质和它的严重的政治后果，因而振臂奋起，投入战斗。但是，不管怎样，这次斗争的前前后后，已经充分暴露了知识界思想上的混乱情况。我们生活和工作在知识界中，我自己也算一个知识分子，不能不为这种情况而感到心情沉重，也不能不探索一下导致这种情况的根本原因。
    为什么被右派分子灌了迷汤？要从知识分子本身的弱点寻找原因
    应该说，七年来，在党的“团结、教育、改造”的方针的指导下，依靠各级党组织的领导、关怀和帮助，依靠知识分子自己主观的自觉的努力，知识分子的思想水平是有所提高的。他们划清了敌我界限，站到人民的立场上来；他们为我们国家的社会主义改造和社会主义建设，贡献出了自己的一定的聪明才智；他们当中的一些人，经过刻苦学习和实际锻炼，已经逐步掌握了马克思列宁主义的世界观，并且基本上适应自己社会政治地位的转变，成为工人阶级先锋队的一员——光荣的共产党员。我们认为，对于知识分子的这种进步应当有足够的估计，不能因为在这次反右派斗争中所出现的思想上的混乱情况而把知识界的进步一笔抹煞，全盘否定。但是，足够的估计应当意味着实事求是的估计，而不应当是添枝加叶地为知识分子抹粉擦脂。现在的问题是，许多知识分子对自己的进步估计过高。在社会主义革命中，明明白白立场问题没有很好解决，但却有人不怀好心地向知识分子讨好献媚，倡言“现在知识分子的思想改造已进入了细致的观点和方法问题”（费孝通：“早春前后”）。明明白白许多知识分子对我们的国家事务还缺乏充分的主人翁感觉，但却有人心怀叵测地鼓励知识分子不要做“脱颖而出的毛遂”，要做“隆中待访的诸葛亮”（罗隆基：政协第二届第三次全体会议上的发言）。明明白白知识分子还没有很好地理解个人与集体的关系，没有很好地理解一滴水只能放在浩瀚汪洋的大海中才能永不干涸的道理，但却有人恶毒地鼓励知识分子的自大狂，说“十个大学教授可以抵得上十万群众”（罗隆基）。这些别有用心的、对党、对人民翘尾巴的知识分子的言论，在知识界里面播毒甚广，流毒甚深，以致有不少人被他们灌了迷汤，误认为思想改造已经差不多了，“一间房、两本书”的要求出来了，“马列主义不行时”的怪论也出来了。自然，尽责怪这些狼子野心的知识分子也还是不全面的，外因要通过内因才能起作用，因此，知识界对思想进步估计过高的现象，还应当从知识分子本身的弱点去寻找、去发掘。这些年来，我在高等学校里边工作，和许多高级知识分子在一起学习，习以为常地听到一种“提高一步”的说法。就是说，每次学习运动将届结束，人们在写学习总结或谈到学习心得的时候，总喜欢说（或者是醉心于过高地估计成绩，不假思索地说），“通过这次学习，我的认识和思想提高一步。”例如：“通过土地改革文件的学习，我的认识和思想提高一步”；“通过抗美援朝运动文件的学习，我的认识和思想提高一步”；“通过镇反、肃反运动，我的认识和思想提高一步”；“通过思想改造运动，我的认识和思想提高一步”；“通过总路线文件、宪法文件、苏共二十次党代表大会文件、‘关于无产阶级专政的历史经验’、‘八大’文件、‘再论无产阶级专政的历史经验’的学习以及十大关系报告的传达，我的认识和思想提高一步”，等等。应该说，人们通过这样一系列的学习，的确是有所提高的；也应该说，人们思想认识的提高，的确是要一步一步、循序渐进的。但是，奇怪得很，提高一步又提高一步，临到反右派斗争的时候，结果却等于挨了一记“闷棍”，连六项政治标准也心中无底，从高处往低处狠狠地摔了一跤，一落千丈，回过头来还在抱屈地叫嚷“言者无罪”，抱怨地责怪党为什么早先不打个招呼，把六项政治标准揭示出来（这是指好心的知识分子而言，右派分子不在内）。这种情况，除了把思想改造的成就估计过高、把自己思想认识的提高估计过大、而在每次学习中没有深刻地结合自己的血肉骨髓外，还能够找到其它任何别的解释吗？总之，这次反右派斗争所暴露出来的知识界的思想混乱情况，向我们提示：知识分子的思想改造有成绩，但知识分子自己把这些成绩估计过高，才在现实面前不能不接受一次大大的惨痛的教训！
    党对知识分子早有公允的估计和明确的指示
    那么，党对这个问题怎么看法呢？
    还在去年一月间的时候，周恩来总理就在“关于知识分子问题的报告”中指出：“我国的知识界的面貌在过去六年来已经发生了根本的变化。”但“报告”又接着指出：“知识分子的思想状态，同他们在政治和社会地位上的变化并不是完全相适应的。”“在我们的企业、学校、机关里，在社会上，都还有这样的知识分子：他们在共产党和国民党之间、中国人民和帝国主义之间不分敌我；他们不满意党和人民政府的政策和措施，留恋资本主义甚至留恋封建主义；他们反对苏联，不愿意学习苏联；他们拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，并且诋毁马克思列宁主义；他们轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，轻视劳动人民出身的干部，不愿意同工人农民和工农干部接近；他们不愿意看见新生力量的生长，认为进步分子是投机；他们不但常常在知识分子和党之间制造纠纷和对立，而且也在知识分子中间制造纠纷和对立；他们妄自尊大，自以为天下第一，不能接受任何人的领导和任何人的批评；他们否认人民的利益、社会的利益，看一切问题都从个人的利益出发，合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对。”因此，周恩来总理在“报告”中说：“继续帮助知识分子进行自我改造，是党在过渡时期的重要的政治任务之一。”从周恩来总理“关于知识分子问题的报告”中可以明白：党对知识分子的进步有着足够的估计，党对知识分子现存的缺点和弱点有着清醒的认识，党对知识分子今后进行思想改造的任务也有着明确的指示。党的看法是实事求是的，是公平恰当的。对照今天资产阶级右派的言行和一般知识分子的思想混乱情况，我们一方面感到党的领导的预见性和党的政策的正确性；另一方面也感到我们知识分子辜负了党的殷殷期望，“依然故我”，长进不大，我们应该是怀着负罪的心情来向党汇报的。
    知识分子思想改造为什么未能尽如人意？最根本的原因是没有在火热的群众斗争中承受严峻的考验
    现在应该问：为什么我们知识分子在思想改造方面未能尽如人意？为什么我们的立场未能改变过来？为什么在反右派斗争中知识界的思想如此混乱？
    我认为，最根本的原因，是我们知识分子没有经过实际的锻炼，没有在火热的群众斗争中承受严峻的考验。一九五二年的思想改造运动虽然猛烈一些，但当时的政治形势赋予思想改造运动的目的，只是要知识分子划清敌我界限，站到人民的立场上来。到社会主义革命阶段，社会政治形势要求知识分子的已不是一般的人民立场，而是社会主义的、工人阶级的立场。社会主义革命，我们采取的是和平改造的、不流血的办法，生产关系的大变革和人们物质生活和文化生活的大变化，在广大人民群众的思想上和生活方式上引起了强烈深远的震动，但对于知识界的冲击却显得小一些。冲击小一些并不见得是好现象，因为这会在一定程度上影响到知识界在立场方面的转变。未经过风霜雨雪的、未经过深刻冲激的、未改变立场的知识界，一经投入波浪翻滚的沸腾的新生活当中，就不能不时时、处处感到不习惯、不协调、不熟习、不适应了。
    为什么罗隆基费孝通的臭气熏天的言论在不少知识分子中引起共鸣？无他，臭味相投、声气相通、立场相近而已
    正是由于知识界放松了在火热斗争中的思想改造，放松了在社会主义革命阶段中进行立场的转变，所以章罗联盟就把魔爪伸入这片“沃土”，在这片“沃土”上培育毒苗毒草。也就是说，以知识界为“垫脚石”，作为他们梦想的“政治资本”和
  “群众基础”，来进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    正是由于知识界放松了在火热斗争中的思想改造，放松了在社会主义革命阶段中进行立场的转变，免疫力不强，抵抗力不旺，所以罗隆基、费孝通之流的臭气熏天的文章，居然会在知识界的一部分人当中引起共鸣。罗隆基恬不知耻地以知识分子的“代言人”自居，在政协第二届第三次全体会议上的发言，实质上是一篇反党的、向党挑战的“通牒”。明眼人易于发现这篇发言的意旨，即：一方面向党要挟，另一方面笼络一部分落后的知识分子，要他们自甘落后，对祖国的命运不关心，对社会主义的命运不关心，对国计民生，丝毫用不着有什么主人翁的责任感，只有静待共产党来“礼贤下士”、“三顾茅庐”。费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”和“早春前后”，则是两篇包藏祸心的文章，字字句句埋了鸡骨头，行行段段搀杂了砒霜。他一方面倾泻了自己的资产阶级的世纪末的颓废的感情，大谈其自己的“体质”与“气候”的适应关系，以便来感染那些在伟大时代仍然有落寞之感的知识分子；另一方面他不怀好意地煽惑人们去揭盖子：先揭“百家争鸣”的盖子，后揭“互相监督”的盖子。他不主张“欲揭还罢”，而主张“迟揭不如早揭，小揭不如大揭，揭开了比冲开为妙”。如果人们把他在“知识分子的早春天气”一文中对知识分子在“春暖花开”时节“发挥政治积极性”的号召，把他在“早春前后”一文中要“冲开”“盖子”的那种气势逼人的姿态，再和章罗联盟的核心骨干以及其他右派分子到处点火、向党进攻的事实两相对照，就可以看出费孝通用心之险恶了。一篇发言和两篇文章，出现在反右派斗争的前夕，本来，透过纸背，人们可以看出右派分子的嘴脸；细审他们的用语行文，人们也可以嗅到一些右派分子的反共、反人民、反社会主义的气味。但是，知识分子没有这么作，有不少的知识分子在为罗隆基这篇酸臭发霉、“收买人心”的发言喝采，也有不少的知识分子在为费孝通这两篇专门唱反调的“杂文”叫好。为什么？无他，臭味相投、声气相通、立场相近而已。当人们揭穿了章罗联盟等右派分子的狰狞面貌以后，那些喝采叫好的知识分子究竟应当如何自处呢？除了加强自己的思想改造，锻炼自己的立场，提高自己的革命嗅觉和革命警惕，还能有别的什么办法么？
    章罗联盟的丑恶嘴脸揭露以后，那些“好心”的知识分子该怎么办？不去掉温情主义的面纱是看不清楚路途的
    现在，人们应该有理由进一步问：当章罗联盟的丑恶嘴脸揭露以后，那些“好心”的知识分子应当怎么办呢？
    我认为，最好的办法，是挽起袖子，坚决撕破他们的肮脏面子，坚决搞垮他们的臭架子，让人们看看：这究竟是一流什么样的货色！有人说，手软，下不了手。为什么手软？为什么下不了手？一因人熟面熟，大家相处多年，脸面相碍；一因这些人有些“才”，不要过分使他难堪，还得留点回旋余地，以便他们能在悔罪后有所报效于人民。好一副温情主义者的面孔！你和章伯钧、罗隆基等等人面熟，有交情，你不打他，他反共、反社会主义，你置六亿人民于何地？你对这批人情深谊厚，对六亿人民情寡义薄，这又是什么立场？钱伟长、曾昭抡、费孝通等那么一小撮自高自大的反党反社会主义的英美留学生的确有“才”有“学”，的确够高深渊博的，但他们心怀贰志，“才”大“学”广，于人民又有何益？你坚决作为右派打他们，如果他们能回心转意，洗心革面，朝向人民，为人民做事，这才算够朋友，讲义气，对人民也才会有好处。否则，这样的温情主义，反映到政治上来，只能是一种毫无是非的自由主义而已。我在投入反右派斗争的战斗中经常思索一些问题，待到我发现费孝通这位“学者”也在用“温情主义”的幌子来掩盖章罗联盟及其核心小集团的反动言行时，我才恍然大悟：原来“温情主义”有如此广泛的“用途”！这就使我警惕，深深地认识到：野性难驯的狼总归是要吃人的，养狼是要贻患的；对右派分子打击得不狠，不坚决，祸害也是无穷的。不去掉温情主义的面纱，自己究竟是以一个什么样的政治立场来参加这场反右派的斗争呢？
    总起来说：从知识分子在反右派斗争中所暴露出来的思想混乱情况来看，从知识分子对自己进步估计过高的现状来看，从党对知识分子的缺点的分析来看，从知识分子可能作为政治野心家的“垫脚石”来看，从知识分子在反右派斗争中所表现出来的温情主义来看，等等，都从根本上说明一个问题：一切追求进步的、善良正直的、爱国的、革命的知识分子，都必须学习鲁迅，下壮士断腕的决心，无情地解剖自己，在党的领导下，在反右派的群众斗争中，加强思想改造，改变自己的立场和世界观。对知识分子来说，反右派斗争中知识界思想混乱情况的大暴露，的确是一次十分惨痛的教训。能感到这份痛苦，能吸取教训，继续前进，加强思想改造，就能感到脱胎换骨的愉快，否则，一步掉队，百步就跟不上了。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话中指出：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”
    毛主席的话是语重心长的！我们应当坚决执行毛主席的指示，坚决执行党的指示。跟着毛主席走，跟着党走。只有积极地投入反右派的斗争，积极地改造自己的思想，从基本上解决了立场问题，才能死心塌地地更好地为人民服务。
