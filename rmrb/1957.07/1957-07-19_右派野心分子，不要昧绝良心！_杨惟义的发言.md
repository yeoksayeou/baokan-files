I completely agree with and support all the reports in this conference.

In Premier Zhou's report, he affirmed the achievements, criticized the shortcomings, and clearly distinguished right from wrong. It is pragmatic and appropriate. This is not only a government work report but also a rich political and ideological education textbook. I suggest that this report, together with Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," should be combined for an in-depth campaign across the country, and everyone should study them seriously.

In recent months, some right-wing elements with ambitions, in an organized, planned, step-by-step manner, with programs and lines, have carried out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities, abandoning their conscience, reversing black and white, insisting that everything in the country has been messed up, the leadership of the Communist Party is bad, the people's democratic dictatorship and democratic centralism are no good, and the socialist road is wrong, etc. Not only are there malicious remarks, but also people are sent to various places to create adverse public opinion in many ways, setting fires everywhere, trying to create chaos in the country, forcing the Communist Party to step down, and letting them take over. I am extremely indignant at their words and deeds and conspiracies and cannot but condemn them severely.

Before Liberation, the bad things were endless; after Liberation, the good things are inexhaustible.

These ambitious elements completely obliterate the facts: What was the situation in China before liberation? The bad things were endless. What is the situation after liberation? The good things are inexhaustible. Comparing today with the past, it's like heaven and earth. The facts are there, right before our eyes. Can they not admit it? Now, in the country, everything is flourishing, and everything is advancing. Whether it is politics, economy, finance, military affairs, industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, health, culture, education, science, social atmosphere, people's lives, or international status, I ask, which item has not progressed? It is not very bad, but very good, unprecedented in history.

The people of the whole country, seeing their motherland, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, getting better and better every day, and appearing in the world with a strong posture, are all jubilant and proud, and have more confidence and courage to work together to carry out our great socialist construction. But these self-proclaimed great intellectuals, with abnormal psychology, actually feel very unhappy, which is really strange. They do not recognize the progress of society, do not see the development of the cause, and talk nonsense. If their eyes have not lost their function, then their sensitivity is too slow, and they are too ignorant. How can they be worthy of being called great intellectuals? They are simply muddleheaded fools who cannot tell good from bad and big bags of grass who do not know the times.

After liberation, I worked in Jiangxi, and I am more familiar with the situation. I have personally seen the vigorous development of various undertakings in Jiangxi Province, just like other provinces, and the achievements are very great. I can briefly list the facts to refute the nonsense of the right-wing ambitionists.

First, let me talk about the grain issue. Jiangxi has always been known as the land of fish and rice, but before liberation, the reactionary government only cared about exploitation and did not care about agricultural affairs. Water, drought, and insect disasters came one after another, with poor harvests two out of three years, and there were often famines. However, since liberation, because the Party and government have attached importance to agricultural affairs, vigorously built water conservancy projects, called for accumulating fertilizer, preventing and controlling pests, and improving other agricultural technologies, grain production has continued to grow. For example, when Jiangxi was initially liberated in 1949, the total grain output of the province was only about 8 billion catties; in 1950, it increased to 8.6 billion catties; in 1951, it was 8.4 billion catties; from 1952 to 1954, the total output each year was at the level of 11.5 billion catties; in 1955, it was 12.3 billion catties; in 1956, it increased to 13 billion catties. Compared with the total grain output at the beginning of liberation in 1949, it increased by 5 billion catties. In percentage terms, the increase reached 77 percent. Is this not an achievement, but a mess?

Especially in 1954, the Yangtze River Basin encountered a major flood unseen in a century, and Jiangxi was of course one of the severely affected areas. If it were in the era of the reactionary government, what would have happened! I don't know how many people would have starved to death, and I don't know what kind of tragic scene would have unfolded. However, under the constant care of the People's Government, a large number of people were organized to go to the disaster areas to provide vigorous assistance, enabling the victims to have a place to return to, clothes to wear, food to eat, and the sick to be treated, so that they would not suffer from cold, hunger, and disease without anyone to turn to. A large amount of production funds were also invested to help them resume production and save themselves, and the following year, there was a bumper harvest. Many disaster victims were able to quickly restore their pre-disaster lives, and they were all extremely grateful. In the eyes of the right-wing ambitionists, this is another very wrong thing to do, right?

Because of the continuous increase in production year after year, farmers have continuously increased their income and can continuously improve their lives. Therefore, it is now very difficult to see the past suffering of being poorly clothed and tattered in various parts of Jiangxi. Especially young women, many of them wear colorful clothes while working in the fields. From this point, it can be seen that the lives of ordinary farmers are gradually improving. Listening to the reports of other farmer representatives, it is even more believable that this is indeed the case. The right-wing elements insist on distorting the facts and saying the nonsense that the lives of farmers are getting harder and harder, which can be refuted without any attack.

How can one hand cover the eyes of the world?

Furthermore, taking the achievements of Jiangxi in 1956 as an example, they were as great as those of all provinces in the country. In the province's rural areas, advanced agricultural cooperativization has been basically realized, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production has soared to an unprecedented level. Therefore, the province's total grain output last year suddenly increased to 13 billion catties, far exceeding the pre-war historical record of just over 10 billion catties, which further demonstrates the superiority of agricultural cooperativization. The province's handicrafts and individual fishermen have basically realized cooperativization. As for the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, it has also been successfully completed, and everyone can find their place. These three major reforms have historically significant major victories, which can show that the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the history of thousands of years of class exploitation has basically ended, and the socialist system has been basically established. From then on, we can vigorously and powerfully promote the rapid development of various construction undertakings in the province. The people of the whole province are extremely happy about this, and they celebrate these victories with great fanfare, drumming and gongs. What do the right-wing elements think? Don't they think these are the greatest miracles in history?

Other undertakings such as industry, mining, transportation, culture, and education have also made great progress in Jiangxi. There is no way to describe them in detail. In short, Jiangxi today is a Jiangxi with a new look, not a Jiangxi that has been ravaged by war, reactionary governments, and the Japanese army, resulting in a dilapidated state. Jiangxi is like this, and so are other places, all advancing by leaps and bounds. This is what I have personally seen during my inspections in various places in recent years, and it is also what the people of the whole country have seen. The right-wing elements deny the facts. How can one hand cover the eyes of the world?

Right-wing politicians want to lead science and universities, which is really overestimating themselves.

A few ambitious right-wing elements, neither knowing their own limitations nor feeling ashamed, advocate that the Communist Party cannot lead science and that they should lead it; they want the Party committee to withdraw from universities and let them develop their organizations. This is really absurd! Everyone has long seen through these idle politicians in the old society. What skills do they have to lead science and universities? Who will invite them to lead? I am a scientific worker and also a higher education worker. I have been dealing with scientists and university teachers for a long time, and of course I am not more unfamiliar with their situation than these ambitious people. As far as I know, the vast majority of scientists and university teachers are very patriotic. Seeing that the Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country to carry out the revolution and has done such a good job of the motherland in recent years, they all support and love it as their leader. They will not welcome these ambitious people to join the scientific ranks and universities to engage in reactionary activities. Only a very small number of people with unstable positions and unclear minds will be dragged into the quagmire by their sweet words. Their private goods do not have much of a market, but we must always be vigilant.

We probably won't forget, will we? What kind of life did the people live before liberation? It was really unspeakable suffering. Anyone with patriotic ideas, seeing the daily decline of the country, often had the worry that the country would perish soon, and their spirits were under solemn pressure, fearing that they would inevitably become slaves of a foreign country. After liberation, the situation changed greatly. Heaven and earth were reversed, weakness was turned into strength, and danger was turned into safety. The people all have their own livelihoods, can stand up straight, and can raise their eyebrows and exhale. And the worry in our minds about being slaves of a foreign country has also been washed away, never to return. This alone can make us sincerely admire and be endlessly grateful to the Communist Party and be willing to follow the Communist Party for life. The right-wing elements are really heartless. They don't feel comfortable living such a good life, but they still want to stir up trouble, destroy the constitution, and want to kill the Communists, overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and let them rule the world, pulling the wheel of progress onto the dead road of capitalism, wanting us to live the same difficult and frowning life as before. We firmly do not agree!

Right-wing ambitionists, don't think that the people can be deceived.

Right-wing ambitionists, be sensible and don't think that the people are all Adou and can be deceived and cheated. You must know that the eyes of the people are sharp. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, the people will know about any illegal actions you take. Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all. The masses have long suspected your ambitions. Moreover, there are Chairman Mao's six criteria for distinguishing right from wrong. This is a very scientific demon-revealing mirror. No matter how eloquently and sophistically you argue, using this standard to measure, any demons and ghosts will show their true colors under this scientific demon-revealing mirror. Your ghostly words and deeds have been exposed from all sides. It's not just the fox's tail that has been revealed, but the ugly state is completely exposed. The general workers and peasants are very angry when they hear about these crazy things you have done. Some workers said, "I want to raise my hammer and smash the heads of these guys." Some farmers said, "I want to dig out their dog hearts with a hoe." It can be seen that your private goods will not be welcomed. Only some intellectuals with unstable positions and enemies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the British and American capitalist countries will greatly praise you. Isn't this very strange? It's not strange. I remember when I read The Biography of Yue Fei, when Yue Fei resisted the Jin people and his momentum was like a broken bamboo, he fought to Zhuxian Town, and he was about to send troops to launch a long-distance expedition to directly attack Huanglong and drink heartily, the people's hearts were thus uplifted, and everyone praised him. Only Qin Hui was unhappy, and at this time, he advocated peace talks, which the people hated, and the Jin people were very welcome. Now the words and deeds of the right-wing elements are greatly appreciated by the enemy and angered by the people of the country. Isn't the reason easy to understand? Right-wing ambitionists, you can stop. You must know that your words and deeds are extremely harmful to the motherland and have committed the great mistake of cutting yourselves off from the people of the country. You must immediately repent, and all the things you have done that you are sorry for the motherland and the people should be honestly, frankly, and completely confessed to the people of the whole country for forgiveness. Otherwise, if you are obsessed and try to quibble and deny it, you will not be able to deny it. If your ambitions do not die and you still want to seize the opportunity to rise again and carry out sabotage, the country has its own laws that will give you the punishment you deserve. These words can be said to be a warning to the right-wing ambitionists, and also a serious warning!

### 右派野心分子，不要昧绝良心！  杨惟义的发言

专栏：

    右派野心分子，不要昧绝良心！
    杨惟义的发言
    我完全同意并拥护这次大会中的各项报告。
    在周总理的报告中，肯定了成绩，批评了缺点，明辨出是非，都是实事求是，恰如其分的。这不仅是政府的工作报告，而是一个很有丰富内容的政治思想教育课本。我建议应把这个报告和毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，结合起来，在全国各地，展开一次深入的宣传，人人都应当认真去学习。
    近几个月来，有些胸怀野心的右派分子，有组织、有计划、有步骤、有纲领、有路线地进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的活动，昧绝良心，颠倒黑白，硬说国内样样事体都搞糟了，共产党领导坏了，人民民主专政和民主集中制都不好，社会主义的道路走错了等等。不但是有恶意的言论，并且还派人到各地去，从多方面造成不良舆论，到处点火，想把国内搞得大乱，迫使共产党下台，让他们取而代之。我对于他们的言行和阴谋，极端愤慨，不能不予以痛斥。
    解放前坏处说不尽，解放后好处谈不完
    这些野心分子，完全抹煞事实：解放以前，中国的情形是怎么样？坏处是说不尽的。解放以后，情形是怎么样？好处是谈不完的。以今比昔，判若天壤，事实俱在，摆在眼前，能不承认么？现在国内，百废俱兴，事事挺进，不论是政治、经济、财政、军事、工农商业、交通、卫生、文化、教育、科学、社会风气、人民生活和国际地位等，试问那项，没有进步？不是坏得很，而是好得很，为千古所未有。
    全国人民，看到自己的祖国，在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，一天一天的好起来了，而以强盛的姿态出现于世界，无不欢欣鼓舞，引为自豪，更有信心和勇气，来共同努力进行我们社会主义的伟大建设。但是这些自命是了不起的大知识分子，心理反常，竟感到很不痛快，真太奇怪。他们不去认识社会的进步，看不到事业的发展，信口瞎说。如果不是他们的双目失掉作用，那便是他们的敏感性太迟钝，太无见识，怎能配得上称为大知识分子？简直是不识好歹的糊涂虫和不识时务的大草包。
    解放以后，我在江西工作，情形更为熟悉，亲眼看到江西境内各项事业的蓬勃发展，和其他各省一样，成绩是很巨大的。可以略举事实，反驳右派野心分子的一派胡说。
    首先我来谈谈粮食问题，江西向来称为鱼米之乡，可是在解放以前，反动政府，只管剥削，不问农事，水、旱、虫灾相迭而至，三年两歉，常有饥荒。然自解放以后，因为党政重视农事，大力兴修水利，号召积肥，防治害虫，并改进其他各种农业技术等，粮食产量，得以不断增长。如在一九四九年初解放时，全省粮食总产量，只有八十亿斤左右；一九五○年增至八十六亿斤；一九五一年为八十四亿斤；一九五二至一九五四年，每年的总产量都在一百一十五亿斤的水平；一九五五年为一百二十三亿斤；一九五六年增至一百三十亿斤。比一九四九年初解放时的粮食总产量，增加五十亿斤。按百分数即是增产达百分之七十七。这难道不是成绩，而是搞糟了么？
    尤其是在一九五四年，长江流域遇到百年未有的大水灾，江西当然亦是一个重灾区之一。如果在反动政府时代，那怎样得了呀！不知道要饿死多少人，不知会演成何种惨象。但在人民政府的旦夕关怀下，组织大批人员，分赴灾区，大力援救，能使灾民各有所归，各有所衣，各有所食，病者亦有所医治，不致遭受到冻饿疾病时而无所告。并投以大宗的生产资金，帮助他们生产自救，次年便有丰收，许多灾民能很快地恢复灾前的生活，无不感激莫名。照右派野心分子看来，这又是做得很不对的事体吧？
    因为年年不断的增产，农民不断地增加收入而能不断地改善生活，所以现在江西各地的农民是很不容易看到有以前那样衣不被体，褴褛不堪的苦况了。尤其是青年妇女，很多都是穿上花花绿绿的衣服而在田间工作。由这一点，即可看出，一般农民的生活，是逐渐在改善了。再听其他农民代表的报告，更可相信这是的确的事实。右派分子，硬要歪曲事实，偏说农民生活越来越苦的鬼话，可以不攻自破。
    怎能以一手掩天下之目
    再拿一九五六年江西方面的成就来说，亦是和全国各省一样，非常巨大的。全省农村中，已经基本上实现高级农业合作化，农民生产积极性空前高涨，因此全省粮食总产量，去年就突增到一百三十亿斤，超过战前历史最高记录仅为一百多亿斤的产量甚远，愈能显出农业合作化的优越性。全省手工业和个体渔民，都已经基本上实现合作化了。至于私营工商业的社会主义改造，也已顺利完成，而能各得其所。这些三大改革，都有历史意义的重大胜利，可以表明，社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，几千年的阶级剥削制度的历史，已经基本结束，社会主义的制度已经基本建立起来了。从此可以浩浩荡荡、更有力地来推动全省各项建设事业的迅速发展。全省人民莫不为此而高兴无比，热热闹闹，打鼓敲锣，来庆祝这些胜利。右派分子，感想如何？认为这些不是历史上最伟大的奇迹么？
    其他如工矿、交通、文化、教育等事业，在江西方面，都相应地有很大的进步，这又无法再细说的。总之，现在的江西，是一片新气象的江西，而不是如同以前那样久经战争、被反动政府和日本军队蹂躏不堪而造成破破烂烂的江西了。江西如此，他处亦同，都是大踏步地正在前进中，这是近年来我到各地视察所亲眼看到的，也是全国人民所共见的。右派分子，否定事实，怎能以一手掩天下之目？
    右派政客想领导科学和高等学校，真太不自量了
    少数野心勃勃的右派分子，既不自量，又不害臊，倡言共产党不能领导科学，要让他们来领导才行；要党委退出高等学校，让他们来发展组织，这真是岂有此理！他们这些旧社会中的无聊政客，大家早已看穿了，凭什么本领来领导科学和高等学校？谁来请他们领导？我是一个科学工作者，又是高等教育工作者，长期与科学界和高等学校的教师打交道，对于他们的情况，当然不会比这些野心家更生疏。据我所知，绝大多数的科学家和高等学校的教师，都是很爱国的，看到中国共产党领导全国人民进行革命，几年来能把祖国搞得这样好，都是很拥护而爱戴它做领导的，不会欢迎这些野心家到科学队伍中和高等学校中去做领导，来搞反动勾当的。只有极少数立场不稳和头脑不清的人，才会被他们花言巧语，拖下泥坑。他们的私货是没有多大市场的，然而亦须时常提高警惕。
    大概我们不会忘记吧？解放以前，人民过的是什么生活？真是苦不堪言。凡有爱国思想的人，看到国势日危，常有国亡无日的可虑，精神上无不受到郑重的压力，恐怕难免不致于做亡国奴。解放以后，情形大变，旋乾转坤，变弱为强，转危为安，人民各有生业，可以挺直胸膛，扬眉吐气。而我们脑子中怕做亡国奴的忧虑，亦已洗清干净，一去不复返了。即此一点，就可使我们心悦诚服，感激共产党不尽而愿毕生跟着共产党跑。右派分子，真是太无心肝，这样好的日子，过得不自在，还要兴风作浪，破坏宪法，并想杀死共产党人，推翻共产党领导，由他们来坐天下，把进步车轮拉到资本主义的死亡道路上去，要我们再过以前那样困苦不堪、愁眉不展的生活，我们是坚决不答应的！
    右派野心分子不要以为人民是可欺的
    右派野心分子，要识相一点，不要以为人民都是阿斗而可欺可骗的。要知道人民的眼睛都是雪亮的，在万目睽睽的注视下，你们有一点不法的行动，人民都会知道的。司马昭之心，路人皆知，你们的野心，群众老早就在怀疑了。况且现有毛主席六条标准，可以辨别是非，这是很科学的照妖镜，任凭你们花言巧语，强词夺理的狡辩，用这个标准去衡量，任何妖魔鬼怪，在这个科学的照妖镜下，都要现出原形。你们的鬼秘言行，已经是从各方面揭露出来了，不只是现出了狐狸尾巴，而是丑态毕露。一般工农同志，听到你们干出这些疯狂的事，都很愤恨。有的工人同志说：“我要举起铁锤，打破这些家伙的脑袋。”有的农民同志说：“我要用锄头挖出他们的狗心肝。”可见你们的私货是不会受人欢迎的。只有一些立场不稳定的知识分子和台湾、香港以及英美资本主义国家中的敌人，才会大大地捧起你们。这不是很奇怪么？并不奇怪，我记得以前读岳飞传时，当岳飞抵抗金人，势如破竹，打到朱仙镇，并即出兵，长驱远征，要直捣黄龙而痛饮，人心因此振奋，无不称快。只有秦桧独不高兴，即于此时，大唱和议，国人痛恨，而金人非常欢迎。现在右派分子的言行，大为敌人所赞赏而为国人所愤怒，道理不是很容易懂么？右派野心分子，可以休矣，你们要知道，你们的言行，对于祖国是极有危害的，犯了自绝于国人的极大错误。你们必须立即痛改前非，把以前所做一切对不起祖国、对不起人民的事，都应老老实实、坦坦白白、完全交代出来，向全国人民请罪，尚可得到人民的宽恕。否则执迷不悟，徒逞狡辩，要想抵赖，那是抵赖不过去的。如果野心不死，还想伺机再起，进行捣乱，国家自有法律，会给你们以应得的处分。这些言词，对于右派野心家，可以说是一个忠告，亦是一个严肃的警告！
