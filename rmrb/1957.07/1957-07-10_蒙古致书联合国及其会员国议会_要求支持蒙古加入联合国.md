Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 9th July - The first session of the Third Great People's Hural of Mongolia passed an appeal on July 8th to the United Nations and the parliaments of its member states, calling on the parliaments of all countries to support Mongolia's entry into the United Nations.

The appeal stated that the Mongolian people demand that their motherland, the Mongolian People's Republic, enjoy its legitimate status within the United Nations, conduct broader cooperation with UN member states, and contribute to the cause of peace.

The appeal stated that Mongolia applied to join the United Nations as early as 1946, and has submitted applications three times since then, but due to the unjust policies adopted by certain member states in the United Nations, Mongolia is still outside the United Nations.

The appeal stated that Mongolia is a peace-loving and independent country, and has established diplomatic relations with countries that account for more than half of the world's population. The policies it pursues are fully in line with the principles of the United Nations. The illegal activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which cannot represent anyone, not only hinder the legitimate rights of the Mongolian People's Republic, but also seriously damage the prestige of the United Nations and its member states. Mongolia will apply to join the United Nations again before the convening of the 12th UN General Assembly.

    蒙古致书联合国及其会员国议会
    要求支持蒙古加入联合国
    新华社乌兰巴托9日电　蒙古第三届大人民呼拉尔第一次会议7月8日通过了给联合国和它的会员国议会的呼吁书，呼吁各国议会支持蒙古进入联合国。
    呼吁书说，蒙古人民要求自己的祖国——蒙古人民共和国在联合国内享有它的合法地位，同联合国会员国进行更加广泛的合作，为和平事业作出贡献。
    呼吁书说，蒙古早在1946年就申请加入联合国，以后又曾经三次提出申请，但是由于联合国中某些会员国采取不公正的政策，蒙古现在仍然处于联合国之外。
    呼吁书说，蒙古是一个爱好和平的独立国家，已经同占世界人口总数一半以上的国家建立了外交关系。它所奉行的政策完全符合联合国的原则。不能代表任何人的蒋介石分子的非法活动，不仅阻挠了蒙古人民共和国的合法权利，并且严重地破坏了联合国及其会员国的威信。在联合国第十二届大会召开以前，蒙古将再次申请加入联合国。
