Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: The news workers' symposium continued on the 18th and 19th.

At the meeting on the 19th, Pu Xixiu continued to confess the Zhang-Luo alliance, Luo Longji's reactionary words and deeds, and the situation of Luo Longji—Pu Xixiu—Wen Hui Bao editorial department.

Pu Xixiu said: The Zhang-Luo alliance had a long period of brewing. Since the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League last year, Luo had stopped scolding Zhang Bojun. Zhang Bojun's work report at that congress, "Everything for Socialism," emphasized studying professional work under the guise of "for socialism," replacing ideological remolding, and Luo expressed his full support. Luo also said to Pu: "Zhang Bojun straddles two parties, and my strength is less than a quarter of Zhang's." "I am a staff talent, good at making wedding dresses for others, and Zhang's temperament is greater than mine." Therefore, he was willing to be subordinate to Zhang Bojun. In August last year, the Zhang-Luo alliance further developed. They planned to unite the rightists, win over the middle, isolate the leftists, and usurp the leadership of the China Democratic League. At the National Work Conference of the China Democratic League in April this year, Zhang and Luo proposed the policy of great development, with free airing of views as the main policy. Luo Longji also proposed with ulterior motives "the contradiction between the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and the bourgeois intellectuals" to provoke the relationship between the Party and the intellectuals. Pu Xixiu said: Although the anti-socialist scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance was only published this year, it had actually been brewing for a long time. In February this year, Zeng Zhaolun raised this issue, and under Luo Longji's instructions, the "Striving for Truth" magazine editorial department invited many scientists to hold a symposium on scientific system issues. The May issue of "Striving for Truth" also published the records of this symposium.

Luo Longji's Small Clique Activities

Regarding the activities of Luo Longji's small clique, Pu Xixiu continued to confess the following situations. In the early days of liberation, Luo Longji had close contacts with Zhang Dongsun, and also with Zeng Zhaolun. Zeng Zhaolun consulted Luo Longji on his confidential matters. Zeng Zhaolun once said in front of Luo and Pu: Dialectical materialism is like the switch of a hub. The Communist Party grabs this switch, and can turn it on or off at will, and we outsiders can't figure it out. Zeng Zhaolun believed that the Party's work arrangements for him were inappropriate, and said to Pu: Before liberation, you and Zigang were very active, why are you silent after liberation? Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun's relationship was very secretive from the beginning. Once, the Premier's Office asked Luo Longji to attend a meeting, but Luo could not be found anywhere. Later, Pu discovered that Luo and Zhang Dongsun were at Liu Wangliming's house, doing something unknown. In 1952, when Luo Longji invited Zhang Dongsun to dinner at Pu Xixiu's house, Luo Longji planned for Zhang Dongsun to seize Yanjing University, Pan Guangdan to seize Tsinghua University, and Zhang Qiaoshi and Huang Daneng to conduct activities in their respective grassroots organizations. With Tsinghua University as the focus, Luo planned to personally conduct activities at Tsinghua University. Pu Xixiu said: After the Zhang Dongsun incident, the activities of Luo Longji's small clique became hidden and dispersed. Luo's activities turned to senior intellectuals. At this time, a small clique with Zeng Zhaolun as its head, and with Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao and others participating, formed around Luo. Luo Longji spent a lot of effort to place Pan Guangdan in the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and nominated Wu Jingchao as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, asking Wu Jingchao to be responsible for the chairman of the China Democratic League branch of Renmin University. Luo also pulled Wu Jingchao to be a standing committee member of the "Striving for Truth" magazine editorial department. Therefore, Wu was extremely grateful to Luo. After the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held this year, Luo Longji invited Wang Zhaoshi to dinner at Quanjude, and after dinner, Luo pulled Wang Zhaoshi and Pan Dakui to his home for secret talks.

Pu Xixiu also revealed Luo Longji's ambiguous relationship with some other people: 1. After Zhang Dongsun's incident was exposed, Ye Duyi talked about some situations of Zhang Dongsun at the Seventh Plenary Session of the China Democratic League Central Committee. Luo Longji said that Ye Duyi was a speculator, saying that Zhang Dongsun colluding with an American third-rate agent was not worth it. Pu said: Whether Luo and Zhang Dongsun had secret contacts is worthy of investigation. 2. According to Luo Longji, a small radio on his bedside was given by the wife of the traitor Zhou Fohai. Luo's relationship with this agent is also worth studying. 3. Luo Longji and Yang Hu are sworn brothers. After liberation, Luo invited Yang Hu to Beijing, and they had frequent contacts. 4. In the early days of liberation, Luo Longji's introduction of Yan Jinwen, the head of Yang Hu's secret service, to the League failed. Later, he placed Yan in a rubber company in Tianjin as an administrator. They had close contacts in the early days of liberation. This spring, Pu also heard Yan calling at Luo's house to find Luo. 5. Pu Xixiu said: After Yu Shangyuan was released, Yu's wife's younger brother's wife called Luo Longji to thank him. What kind of relationship is this, Luo should also explain. 6. Luo Longji once had a very close relationship with his goddaughter Liang Wenqian (Liang Shiqiu's daughter). 7. Luo often went to the Beijing People's Art Theater to dance with actresses. Now the newspaper revealed that Luo had personally borrowed a fire extinguisher at the Beijing People's Art Theater, whether it was these relationships.

Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji's anti-Party and anti-people essence is consistent. Luo often said: Communists are also human beings, and all human beings have desires for fame and fortune, and there are many problems within the Party. Luo regarded the Gao Rao incident and the Hu Feng issue as "factionalism within the Party." Luo also said that the reason why socialism constantly needs to engage in labor competitions is not to encourage people's enthusiasm from fame and fortune. What is the difference between competition and rivalry, I can't see it. Everyone wants to climb up. Luo Longji also said that he wanted to write a tragedy based on Liang Shuming as the central figure, and said that after his above-mentioned tragedy was written, it would definitely "shake the world." Luo Longji often said: Shouting "Long live the Communist Party, long live Chairman Mao" is the most nauseating thing. After the Hungarian incident, Luo's most prominent opinion was that the Soviet Union's sending troops to Hungary was "interference in internal affairs," believing that it was better to lose Hungary than to send troops to Hungary. Last year, during the Egyptian War of Resistance, Luo once said to Pu that he doubted whether Nasser could survive. Luo also admired Eisenhower's approach to the Egyptian issue. Luo said: This time, the United States did a good job, both gaining popularity and seizing profits.

When Pu Xixiu confessed the relationship between Luo Longji—Pu Xixiu—Wen Hui Bao editorial department, she said that the serious mistakes she committed in Wen Hui Bao were: (1) Unconditionally accepting all the instructions of the China Democratic League Central Committee controlled by the Zhang-Luo alliance and distorting them, as the guiding ideology of the office. After Luo Longji's confidant Liu Guanghua came to work at the Beijing office of Wen Hui Bao, even when Pu was not in Beijing, Liu Guanghua also brought the opinions of the China Democratic League Central Committee or Luo Longji to the office. Pu said that she also spread Luo Longji's views on people and things in the Beijing office of Wen Hui Bao at any time and any place. (2) After the Zhang-Luo alliance began to brew the anti-socialist scientific program in February and March this year, Pu immediately implemented the opinions in this program into her work, arranging reporters to interview Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Qian Weichang, Wu Jingchao and others, or soliciting contributions from them, writing a series of articles on reactionary sociology, scientific system, population issues, etc. Pu also regretted not being able to publish Fei Xiaotong's "Early Spring Weather" in Wen Hui Bao. After the China Democratic League Scientific Planning Group put forward the anti-socialist scientific program, Wen Hui Bao also published it at the same time as Guangming Daily. (3) Published Liu Guanghua's manuscript on the "Democracy Wall" of Peking University, and later asked Liu Guanghua to write a manuscript affirming the experience of big-character posters. (4) In order to "find out the bottom of factionalism within the Party in the literary and art circles," Pu Xixiu personally went out to interview Yao Yunzao, and asked: "Does factionalism within the Party hinder the airing of views in the literary and art circles?" Pu also issued Yao Yunzao's article "Whispering in the Literary and Art Circles" which provoked the relationship between the literary and art circles and the Party (Wen Hui Bao did not publish it). (5) Regarding some articles that Wen Hui Bao's Beijing office issued to ignite fires in the literary and art circles, Pu Xixiu said that as the person in charge of the office, the overall responsibility should be borne by her, but she and Mei Duo had a division of labor. Generally, literary and art manuscripts were responsible by Mei Duo, and she hoped that Mei Duo would confess. Pu Xixiu also raised two other mistakes: organizing Lou Bangyan to write manuscripts and asking Liu Guanghua to visit Ge Peiqi. But she said that she had proposed that Lou pay attention to "some engineers want to solve such a problem: whether Party members are used in the government, or above the government," hoping that Lou Bangyan would refer to this when "criticizing" Chu Anping's point of view. She also said that the purpose of asking Liu Guanghua to visit Ge Peiqi was to "further criticize" Ge.

After Pu Xixiu confessed, Lu Xiliang and others from the Central People's Broadcasting Station spoke, saying that it was good for Pu Xixiu to confess and reveal some things today, but they expressed great dissatisfaction with Pu Xixiu's emphasis in today's review that she did not have much connection with Luo Longji's small clique after 1952. They said that Pu Xixiu's relationship with Luo Longji did not become estranged after 1952. What exactly did she do for Luo Longji's small clique, she must continue to confess honestly.

How did the Zhang-Luo alliance cultivate Wen Hui Bao?

Xu Zhucheng confessed on the 18th. Xu Zhucheng said: In May 1948, I met Luo Longji for the first time at the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai. I talked to him about preparing to run Wen Hui Bao in Hong Kong. He tried his best to encourage me to adhere to a "neutral" position in running the newspaper. The rightist Peng Wenying was also present at the time. In June 1949, I saw him for the second time in Shanghai. He told me in detail about his "escape" experience, saying that he relied entirely on the help of Yang Hu and Lu Dagong (Yang Hu's cronies). I said that we were preparing to invite Pu Xixiu to join Wen Hui Bao, and he said that he would definitely encourage Pu Xixiu to join. In September 1949, I participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, and hosted a banquet for democratic figures to talk about the issue of Wen Hui Bao. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji both spoke, expressing their willingness to support Wen Hui Bao. In 1950, I went to Beijing to participate in the first news work conference. Luo Longji asked me to dinner through Pu Xixiu. Wu Jingchao, Pan Guangdan, Qian Duansheng, Fei Xiaotong, etc. were present, and they spoke ill of Wu Han. Xu Zhucheng talked about his four meetings with Luo Longji last year. The first time was in April last year. As soon as Luo Longji met, he talked about Wen Hui Bao not publishing an article he wrote on the constitution and his letter to me for this article. He said, "You are too superstitious about the People's Daily. The People's Daily's editorial on the political system of the People's Republic of China is completely wrong. Not to mention anything else, I am an expert on the constitution, and the Party Central Committee also knows this. When drafting the constitution, many places were revised according to my opinions." The fourth time was in July last year. We had already talked with Comrade Zhang Jichun of the Central Propaganda Department about the Wen Hui Bao's resumption plan, but the location was not decided. Pu Xixiu firmly advocated being in Beijing, and said that Luo Longji also thought Beijing was good. So we went to Luo Longji again, and sent him the editorial policy we were preparing to submit to the Central Propaganda Department to read. He said to us: "The contention of a hundred schools of thought can also discuss specific work issues in newspapers, such as the issue of writing reform can be brought up for discussion first. The opinions within the Party on this issue are also very inconsistent, and many people oppose this reform." Luo Longji also said, "If there are problems with the newspaper, come to Beijing to report, and I will do my best to help you."

Xu Zhucheng said: In 1950, I went to Beijing and saw Zhang Bojun. He once said to me that he loved to read the People's Daily. Last year, he criticized the People's Daily as worthless to me, which shows that he was playing a double-dealing trick. In June last year, when Zhang Bojun invited me, Chu Anping, and Xiao Qian to dinner, he told me that non-Party newspapers should have unique insights, should publish more news from capitalist countries, and local news should not be the same as Party newspapers, and should reflect the depression of intellectuals. He also said that non-Party newspapers could adopt a consistent attitude on the issue of distribution and paper. This conversation gave me a deep impression. In addition to his relationship with Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun, Xu Zhucheng also admitted that Wen Hui Bao has a rightist system of the China Democratic League, and he wanted to use the organization of the China Democratic League in Wen Hui Bao to confront the Party organization, but he did not talk about specific activities. He also talked about his important positions in the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League with Chen Renbing and others, as well as his leadership in the establishment and development of the China Democratic League organization in the Shanghai press, but he also said that he did not do any specific work.

Yu You, a member of the China Democratic League and Guangming Daily, believes that Xu Zhucheng's confession about the situation of the rightists in the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the activities of the rightists in the Shanghai press is unsatisfactory.

Liu Guanghua, a reporter arranged by Luo Longji to work at Wen Hui Bao, confessed at the meeting on the 18th, admitting that he had committed serious political mistakes and had done many things that violated socialist interests under the instructions of Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu. Liu Guanghua said that he had known Luo Longji since he was thirteen or fourteen years old. In 1950, shortly after Liu graduated from university, Luo Longji transferred Liu to work at the China People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. Liu Guanghua admitted that he entered Wen Hui Bao because of Luo Longji's personal relationship. Liu Guanghua said that after he entered Wen Hui Bao, Pu Xixiu originally said that she wanted him to be a sports reporter, but soon after, because of Luo Longji's relationship, she let him run from economics, politics, and social sciences all the way to diplomacy, and repeatedly praised him in public, praising him. Pu Xixiu directly arranged for Liu Guanghua to interview several times, asking him to interview Wu Jingchao, Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan and others on "sociology" and "population issues", and asked him to report on the "Democracy Wall" of Peking University. Pu also said that she had studied the matter of writing about the Democracy Wall of Peking University with Luo Longji. After Pu Xixiu went to Heilongjiang, Liu Guanghua once brought Luo Longji's so-called opinions on the airing of views back to the Wen Hui Bao office in the name of interviewing. Luo Longji said that policy issues such as land reform and wage issues can also be discussed, and Wen Hui Bao should not follow the People's Daily. He said that Luo Longji also wanted Wen Hui Bao to publish his opinions on the airing of views in the form of "Luo Longji answers reporters' questions".

Lin Mengxi, of the Institute of International Studies, who was incited by Liu Guanghua and fiercely attacked the Party during the rectification, said at the meeting that Liu Guanghua repeatedly expressed his fear of chaos during the rectification. Lin Mengxi said that Liu Guanghua often spread some seemingly right but actually wrong "news" and peddled rightist remarks and rumors. Lin Mengxi asked Liu Guanghua to confess which of these remarks came from Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu.

The symposium also criticized Xinhua News Agency's Zou Zhen's reactionary words and deeds. Zou Zhen admitted at the meeting that the vicious attacks he had made on Xinhua News Agency, the Party newspapers, and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the first symposium were deliberate. He said that he was willing to confess his crimes to the people today. Zou Zhen said that his thinking was originally very reactionary. During the Kuomintang rule, he climbed to the position of editor-in-chief of the Nanjing Yishi Daily run by the reactionary head Yu Bin, and frantically opposed the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. Since the great "airing of views," he thought the opportunity to oppose the Party had come, and actively demanded to participate in the press symposium, wanting to set a fire in the press. Zou Zhen said that his speech was made from the position of the editor-in-chief of the Yishi Daily back then. What he shouted for the Central Propaganda Department to open a "green light" to the newspapers was actually to allow the newspapers to scold and attack the Party freely; the so-called democratic newspaper management and democratic agency management was to want the Party to give up the press position and let the right-wing elements occupy it; he described the manuscripts of Xinhua News Agency as a mess, wanting to encourage the newspapers not to use Xinhua News Agency's manuscripts, creating difficulties for Xinhua News Agency, so that he could set a second fire in the agency. Zou Zhen also confessed some of his reactionary words and deeds within Xinhua News Agency, and expressed his willingness to repent.

Tian Lin and Yuan Mu of Xinhua News Agency revealed and criticized Zou Zhen's reactionary words and deeds. Tian Lin said that Zou Zhen's actions had his purpose. Zou Zhen's maximum program was to usurp the Party's leadership over the press under the guise of "democratic newspaper management" and "democratic agency management" together with other right-wing elements; his minimum program was to hope that some so-called democratic parties and private newspapers and news agencies would appear to sing against the Party-led newspapers and news agencies.

    在新闻工作者座谈会上
    浦熙修徐铸成继续吐露罗隆基的阴谋活动
    据新华社19日讯  新闻工作者座谈会18、19两日继续举行。
    浦熙修在19日的会上继续交代了章罗联盟、罗隆基的反动言行和罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部的情形。
    浦熙修说：章罗联盟有着长期的酝酿，从去年民盟第二次全国代表大会起，罗就不再骂章伯钧了。章伯钧在那次大会上作的“一切为了社会主义”工作报告，是在“为了社会主义”的幌子下强调钻研业务，代替思想改造，罗表示完全支持。罗并对浦说过：“章伯钧跨着两个党，我的力量不及章的四分之一。”“我是参谋人才，善于为人作嫁，章的气魄比我大。”因此他甘心屈居章伯钧之下。去年8月，章罗联盟有了进一步发展，他们策划团结右派、争取中间、孤立左派，篡夺民盟领导权。今年4月民盟全国工作会议时，章罗提出大发展的方针，以鸣放为主的方针，罗隆基还别有用意地提出“无产阶级小知识分子和资产阶级大知识分子之间的矛盾”，来挑拨党和知识分子的关系。浦熙修说：章罗联盟的反社会主义科学纲领，虽然今年才发表，实际上也是酝酿已久。今年2月曾昭抡就提出这个问题，在罗隆基指使下，争鸣月刊编辑部就邀请了许多科学家举行科学体制问题的座谈会，争鸣月刊5月号还发表了这次座谈会的记录。
    罗隆基的小集团活动
    关于罗隆基小集团的活动，浦熙修继续交代了以下一些情形。罗隆基在解放初期除了和张东荪来往密切外，和曾昭抡的往来也很密切。曾昭抡的心腹事都要和罗隆基商量。曾昭抡曾经在罗、浦面前说：唯物辩证法好像枢纽的开关一样，共产党抓住这个开关，要开就开，要关就关，我们外人是摸不到底的。曾昭抡曾认为党对他的工作安排得不妥当，并且对浦说：解放前你和子冈都很活跃，为什么解放后没有声息了。浦熙修说：罗隆基和张东荪的关系一开始就很诡秘。有一次总理办公室找罗隆基开会，到处找不到罗，以后浦才发现罗和张东荪在刘王立明家里不知干什么。1952年罗隆基约张东荪在浦熙修家里吃饭时，罗隆基策划张东荪抓燕大、潘光旦抓清华，张乔石、黄大能各在其所属基层组织中活动。并以清华为重点，罗准备亲自到清华活动。浦熙修说：张东荪事件后，罗隆基小集团的活动隐蔽了，分散了，罗的活动方向转向高级知识分子，这时在罗的周围又形成一个以曾昭抡为首、有潘光旦、费孝通、吴景超等人参加的小集团。罗隆基曾费了九牛二虎之力把潘光旦安插在民盟北京市委，又把吴景超提名为全国政协委员，要吴景超负责人民大学民盟支部主委。罗还拉吴景超任争鸣月刊编辑部常委。因此吴对罗感恩不尽。今年全国政协开会后，罗隆基在全聚德请王造时吃饭，饭后罗拉王造时、潘大逵到他家里密谈。
    浦熙修还揭发了罗隆基和另一些人的暧昧关系：一、张东荪的事件暴露后，叶笃义在民盟七中全会上谈到张东荪的一些情况，罗隆基说叶笃义是投机，说张东荪勾结了一个美国三等特务真不值得。浦说：罗是否和张东荪暗中还有来往，值得追究。二、据罗隆基说，他床头上的一个小无线电收音机，是汉奸特务周佛海的老婆送的，罗和这个特务的关系也值得研究。三、罗隆基和杨虎是拜把兄弟，解放后罗把杨虎邀到北京后，时有往来。四、解放初期罗隆基介绍杨虎手下的特务头子阎锦文入盟未成，后来又把阎安插在天津一家橡胶公司当管理员。解放初期他们往来密切。今年春天浦在罗家里还听到阎打电话来要找罗。五、浦熙修说：余上沅被释后，余的妻弟的老婆曾打电话向罗隆基道谢。这是什么关系，罗也应交代。六、罗隆基曾一度和他的干女儿梁文茜（梁实秋的女儿）来往很密切。七、罗经常到北京人民艺术剧院找女演员跳舞，现在报纸上揭露罗曾亲自到北京人艺借便放火，是否就是这些关系。
    浦熙修说：罗隆基的反党反人民的本质是一贯的。罗常说：共产党员一样是人，凡人就有名利欲望，党内的问题也多得很。罗把高饶事件、胡风问题都看做是“党内的宗派主义”。罗又说，社会主义所以不断地要搞劳动竞赛，还不是从名利上来鼓励人的积极性。竞赛与竞争有什么区别，我看不出来。每个人都是想往上爬的。罗隆基还说，他想写一个以梁漱溟为中心人物的悲剧本，并且说今天为什么只有工农兵方向呢，在他的上述悲剧写出后，一定会“惊天动地”。罗隆基常说：喊共产党万岁、毛主席万岁是最肉麻不过的事。匈牙利事件后，罗最突出的意见是苏联出兵匈牙利是“干涉内政”，认为宁可失掉匈牙利也比苏联出兵好。去年埃及抗战时，罗曾对浦说过他对于纳赛尔是否能支持下去是怀疑的。罗还很欣赏艾森豪威尔在埃及问题上的作法。罗说：这次美国做得漂亮，既得了人心，又攫取了利润。
    浦熙修交代罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部的关系时说，她在文汇报所犯的严重错误是：（一）无条件地接受章罗联盟所把持的民盟中央的一切指示和歪曲传达，作为办事处的指导思想。罗隆基的亲信刘光华到文汇报北京办事处来工作后，即使浦不在北京的时候，刘光华也把民盟中央或罗隆基的意见带到了办事处。浦说她还随时随地把罗隆基对人对事的看法在文汇报北京办事处散播。（二）今年2、3月间章罗联盟开始酝酿反社会主义科学纲领后，浦即把这个纲领中的意见贯彻到她的工作中去，安排记者访问曾昭抡、费孝通、钱伟长、吴景超等人或向他们约稿，写出一系列有关反动的社会学、科学体制、人口问题等文章，浦还懊悔没有争取到费孝通的“早春天气”在文汇报发表。民盟科学规划小组提出反社会主义科学纲领后，文汇报也和光明日报同时发表了。（三）发出了刘光华写的北大民主墙的稿件，以后又要刘光华写肯定大字报经验的稿子。（四）为了“摸文艺界党内宗派主义的底”，浦熙修曾亲自和姚芸藻出去访问，并且提出：“党内的宗派主义是否阻碍了文艺界的鸣放？”等问题，浦还发出姚芸藻挑拨文艺界和党的关系的“文艺界窃窃私语”一文（文汇报未刊出）。（五）关于文汇报北京办事处所发的一些在文艺界点火的文章，浦熙修说她作为办事处的负责人，总的责任应当由她负，但她和梅朵有分工，一般文艺界稿件由梅朵负责，她希望梅朵交代。浦熙修还提出其他两个错误是组织楼邦彦写稿和叫刘光华去访问葛佩琦。但她说她曾经提出要楼注意“有些工程师要解决这样一个问题：党员运用于政府之中，还是在政府之上”，希望楼邦彦在“批判”储安平论点时参考。她又说，叫刘光华去访问葛佩琦的目的是为了对葛“作进一步的批驳”。
    浦熙修交代后，中央人民广播电台的鲁西良等人发言说，浦熙修今天又交代和揭露了一些东西是好的，但他们对浦熙修今天在检讨中强调她在1952年以后同罗隆基小集团没多大关联一点，表示十分不满。他们说，浦熙修在1952年后和罗隆基的关系并未疏远，到底为罗隆基小集团做了些什么事，必须继续老实交代。
    章罗联盟如何培植文汇报？
    徐铸成在18日作了交代。徐铸成说：1948年5月我和罗隆基第一次见面，地点在上海虹桥疗养院。我向他谈起准备到香港办文汇报，他竭力鼓励我办报要坚持“中立”立场，当时在座的还有右派分子彭文应。1949年6月，我在上海第二次见到他，他详细地对我谈了“脱险”经过，说全靠杨虎和陆大公
  （杨虎的党羽）的帮助。我说我们准备请浦熙修参加文汇报，他说他一定鼓励浦熙修参加。1949年9月我在北京参加人民政协，曾宴请民主人士谈文汇报的问题，章伯钧、罗隆基都说了话，表示愿意支持文汇报。1950年我到北京参加第一次新闻工作会议，罗隆基曾通过浦熙修请我吃饭，在座的有吴景超、潘光旦、钱端升、费孝通等，他们曾大说吴晗的坏话。徐铸成谈到他去年和罗隆基四次见面的情形。第一次是去年4月，罗隆基一见面就谈起文汇报没有发表他写的一篇关于宪法的文章和他为这篇文章写信给我的事，他说“你太迷信人民日报，人民日报那篇论中华人民共和国政体的社论根本是错的。别的不讲，宪法我是内行，党中央也是知道的，起草宪法时，很多地方是根据我的意见修改的。”第四次是去年7月，我们已和中宣部张际春同志谈好了文汇报复刊计划，就是地点没有决定。浦熙修坚决主张在北京，并说罗隆基也认为北京好。我们就又去找罗隆基，并且把准备向中宣部提出的编辑方针送给他看。他对我们说：“百家争鸣在报纸上也可以讨论具体工作问题，比如文字改革问题就可以首先提出来讨论，党内对这问题的意见也很不统一，很多人反对这样改革。”罗隆基还说“报纸有问题到北京来反映，我尽力帮你们的忙。”
    徐铸成说：1950年我到北京，见到章伯钧，他曾对我说，他爱看人民日报，去年他又对我把人民日报批评得一钱不值，这说明他是在耍两面派手法。去年6月，章伯钧请我和储安平、萧乾吃饭时，他向我说党外报纸应该有独特的见解，应该多登资本主义国家的新闻，本市新闻也不要和党报一样，并且要多反映知识分子的苦闷。他还说各非党报在发行和纸张问题可采取一致的态度。他这次谈话给了我很深的影响。除他和罗隆基、章伯钧的关系之外，徐铸成还承认文汇报有民盟右派系统，他是想利用文汇报民盟的组织和党组织对抗的，但他没有谈具体活动。他也谈到了他在上海市民盟组织和陈仁炳等一同担任重要职位以及他领导上海新闻界民盟组织的建立和发展的事情，但他又说他没有作什么具体的工作。
    民盟盟员、光明日报的于友认为，徐铸成关于民盟上海市委右派的情况、民盟右派在上海新闻界的活动的交代是不能令人满意的。
    被罗隆基安排在文汇报作记者的刘光华18日在会上作交代，承认自己犯了严重的政治错误，受罗隆基、浦熙修的指示，作了许多违反社会主义利益的事。刘光华说，他十三四岁就认得罗隆基。1950年刘在大学毕业不久，罗隆基就把刘调到中国人民保卫世界和平委员会工作。刘光华承认他是因为罗隆基的私人关系进文汇报的。刘光华说，他进文汇报后，浦熙修原说要他做体育记者，但不久后因罗隆基的关系就让他从经济、政治、社会科学一直跑到外交，并且一再当众称赞他，表扬他。浦熙修几次直接布置刘光华采访，要他向吴景超、费孝通、潘光旦等采访“社会学”“人口问题”，要他作关于“北大民主墙”的报道。浦并说采写北大民主墙事她曾和罗隆基研究过。浦熙修到黑龙江去了后，刘光华曾借采访之名，把罗隆基的所谓对鸣放的意见带回文汇报办事处，罗隆基说，关于政策问题如土改、工资问题也可以鸣放，又要文汇报不要跟着人民日报走。他说罗隆基还曾要文汇报以“罗隆基答记者问”的形式发表自己对鸣放的意见。
    受到刘光华煽动、在整风中猛烈攻击党的国际问题研究所林孟熹在会上发言说，刘光华在整风期间一再表示唯恐天下不乱的情绪。林孟熹说，刘光华经常散布一些似是而非的“消息”，贩卖右派言论和谣言。林孟熹要刘光华交代这些言论中哪些是从罗隆基、浦熙修那里来的。
    座谈会还批判了新华社邹震的反动言行。邹震在会上承认他在第一次座谈会上向新华社、党报、中共中央宣传部所作的恶毒攻击是别有用心的，他说今天愿意向人民认罪。邹震说他的思想原来就是非常反动的。他在国民党统治时期爬上过反动头子于斌办的南京益世报总编辑的位置，疯狂地反对过苏联和中国共产党。大“鸣”大“放”以来，他以为反党的机会到了，积极要求参加新闻界座谈会，想在新闻界放一把火。邹震说他那次发言是站在当年益世报总编辑那个立场上说话的。他所叫喊的要中宣部对报纸开放“绿灯”，实际上要报纸对党随便谩骂，自由攻击；所谓民主办报、民主办社，就是想要党让出新闻阵地，由右派分子来占领；他把新华社的稿件描绘得一团糟，是想鼓励报纸不用新华社稿件，给新华社制造困难，以便他在社里放第二把火。邹震还交代了他在新华社内部的一些反动言行，并表示愿意悔改。
    新华社田林、袁木对邹震的反动言行作了揭发和批判。田林说，邹震的所作所为有他的目的，邹震的最高纲领是想在“民主办报”、“民主办社”的幌子下，与其他右派分子篡夺党对新闻事业的领导；他的最低纲领是希望出现一些所谓民主党派和民营的报纸和通讯社，以便与党领导的报纸和通讯社唱对台戏。
