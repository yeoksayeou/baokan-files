    Serving Whom?
  　Liu Lanshan
    In their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist arson, right-wingers often raise the question of "serving whom?" as one of the matches in their box of fire starters. Wang Chongwen's "Whom Does the People's Literature Publishing House Serve?" in the tenth issue of Wenyi Bao is a perfect example.
    Wang Chongwen tried to deceive everyone, starting with a self-posed and self-answered question: "Whom does the People's Literature Publishing House serve? The answer is simple. It mainly serves their own people and those related to them." What's the proof? The evidence is that the deputy director of the publishing house, Comrade Lou Shiyi, has published six books there. Thinking that this fire would surely burn down the publishing house, he smugly revealed their wishful thinking: "Hoping to end this unified situation of monopolizing everything and taking over the selection of topics from now on" (should be read as "Hoping to end the Party's leadership over literary publishing from now on").
      "Sima Zhao's heart is known to all." This is truly "very simple," so simple that it is a self-confession. This right-wing element reveals their intentions completely. It is so simple that no detailed criticism is needed, and this right-wing element's argument falls apart. Therefore, since the question is so simple, I would simply like Wang Chongwen to use his own match to light a lamp and illuminate their dark room, and simply answer: Whom do you serve?

### 为谁服务？

    为谁服务？
  　刘岚山
    右派分子在反党反人民反社会主义的点火中，常常提出“为谁服务”的问题作为他们的满盒火柴中的一根火柴。文艺报第十期王崇文的“人民文学出版社为谁服务？”就是一个绝好的例子。
    王崇文一手遮尽天下人耳目，一开始就自问自答道：“人民文学出版社为谁服务？回答很简单。主要是为他们自己人和跟他们有关系的人服务的。”有何为证？证据是副社长楼适夷同志在该社出版过六本书。他以为这一把火一定能够把这个出版社烧毁了，得意之下，便轻轻拨出他们的如意算盘：“希望从此结束了这一个垄断一切和包办选题的大一统的局面”（应读作“从此结束党对文学出版事业的领导”）。
      “司马昭之心，路人皆见。”这真是“很简单”，简单到不打自招，这个右派分子便把他们的心迹和盘托出了；简单到不需要详细批驳，这个右派分子的论据便破产了。因此，问题既如此简单，我在这里也就简单地希望王崇文利用自己的火柴点起灯来，把他们的暗室照亮，简单地回答一下：你为谁服务？
