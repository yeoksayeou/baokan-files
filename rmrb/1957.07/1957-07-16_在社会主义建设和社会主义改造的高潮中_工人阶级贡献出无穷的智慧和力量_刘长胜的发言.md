I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo, as well as the reports of Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

From the Third Session of the First National People's Congress held last year to this Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, a full year has passed. In this year, tremendous changes have taken place in our country: the three major socialist transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce have achieved great victories, and socialist construction has also achieved tremendous achievements. These victories and achievements are obvious to the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of its own party, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class has contributed its infinite wisdom and strength in the upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and tens of thousands of advanced producers have emerged. Their heroic and exemplary deeds of selfless labor have written a glorious page in the annals of the country's socialist construction.

However, the bourgeois rightists, with their eyes closed, stubbornly insist that national construction last year was an all-round "rash advance," and this year there is an all-round "retreat." In short, in their view, everything is chaotic and terrible. They further come to the conclusion that "the Communist Party does not understand technology and cannot lead national construction," and "the working class has no culture and cannot accomplish great things." They want to obliterate the country's brilliant achievements over the past year, obliterate the correct leadership of the Communist Party, and obliterate the fact that the working class is a powerful force in national construction. I would like to express some opinions on this issue.

Last year, the vast number of employees put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals, creating huge wealth for the country.

Under the slogan of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Chinese working class launched the advanced producer movement, further organizing the labor enthusiasm of the employees and guiding it to a new upsurge. Last year, 1,119,619 employees put forward rationalization proposals for improving production, including 942,880 workers and 168,786 engineers and technicians, totaling 1,831,212 proposals. By the end of 1956, 919,196 proposals had been adopted; 200,645 of those realized and with calculable value could create a wealth of 241,197,743 yuan for the country. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen industries including the First Machine Industry, Second Machine Industry, Textile Industry, and Coal Mining, 5,600 pieces of advanced experience were summarized and promoted last year. The technical mutual assistance movement, in which employees learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and improve together, is very active. Advanced workers help backward workers, old workers lead new workers, experienced workers teach inexperienced workers, and master workers teach apprentices. There are brother contracts, sister contracts, master-apprentice contracts, one-learn-multiple-teach contracts (one person learns the specialties of several people), and one-teach-multiple-learn contracts (one person teaches many people). There is not only individual mutual assistance and mutual learning, but also mutual assistance and mutual learning between groups, workshops, and factories. The technical and professional personnel in the departments and offices, who were very weak in the past competitions, have also been mobilized. In Shanghai alone, more than 200,000 office personnel participated in the competition, and in Shenyang, more than 1,000 office units participated in the competition. Many private sector employees also participated in the competition. Inter-factory competitions have developed greatly. Almost every industry has organized inter-factory competitions. In the textile system alone, 218 units participated in national inter-factory competitions, and 519 units participated in regional inter-factory competitions. The employees fully exerted their initiative and creativity in the advanced producer movement and socialist competition, and solved many major key production problems. For example:

Automobile transportation employees launched the "100,000 kilometers of safe and economical driving without major repairs" movement. Under the circumstances of large transportation volume and insufficient transportation capacity, the volume of freight and passenger transport, the turnover of freight and passenger transport all exceeded the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule by one year. There were 4,984 drivers nationwide who had driven safely for more than 100,000 kilometers, and 3,210 vehicles that had been driven for more than 100,000 kilometers without major repairs. In 1956, the estimated savings in fuel consumption for automobiles compared with the actual consumption in 1955 was 28,435,000 liters, and the average mileage of each tire was extended by 9,774 kilometers compared with 1955.

In the metallurgical industry's Iron and Steel Bureau system, 112,000 tons of steel were produced in 1956 due to the promotion of advanced experience. After the implementation of the rapid combustion method for hot blast stoves, 89% of the blast furnaces increased by an average of 100 degrees compared with 1955, saving 96,000 tons of coke and increasing pig iron production by 44,000 tons throughout the year.

The Sandaogou Bridge Work Zone of the Tumen Engineering Section of the Jilin Railway Administration experienced a situation in which two-fifths of the bridge pier was washed away by river water the year before last, slowing down the speed of trains to North Korea, preventing the completion of transportation tasks to North Korea, and creating a very unsafe situation. At this time, the bridge work zone needed to repair the bridge in a timely manner under the condition of minus 20 degrees Celsius. At that time, six of the eight workers fell ill and could not complete the repair task. For this reason, the masses were mobilized to carry out a rationalization proposal movement. The masses put forward thirteen rationalization proposals and created several tools for repairing bridge piers, such as underwater excavators, underwater stone retrieval devices, underwater detectors, wooden water pumps, etc., solving twelve major key problems in bridge pier repair. Originally, the leadership planned to complete the repair of only four bridge piers last year, but as a result, twenty-four were completed, exceeding the national plan by five times, and completing the 1957 plan ahead of schedule, creating more than 20,000 yuan of wealth for the country. After the promotion of this experience, the bridge repair task of the Jilin Railway Administration has completed the workload of 1959 in one year last year.

After the promotion of the one-shift coal mining method in the coal mining system, the coal mining efficiency was generally increased by 20%, and the highest reached 50%.

The people of the whole country cheered for the rapid development of industrial production last year.

Last year, the total industrial output value increased by 31% compared with 1955, which was the fastest year for industrial production growth in recent years, achieving the great achievement of completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 9.5%. Last year was a year of leaping development in China's socialist construction. This is the result of the efforts of the vast number of workers. Without them, the country's construction is unimaginable. Last year, 842,025 advanced workers and 416,951 model workers were selected nationwide, totaling 1,258,976 people; a total of 114,161 advanced units were selected, including 12,488 advanced workshops, 4,405 advanced work sections, 81,105 advanced groups, and 16,163 advanced functional units.

The above facts show that the advanced producer movement achieved great results last year, and the people of the whole country were overjoyed. At the same time, we must also see that the great development of construction last year, some indicators were a little too large, affecting the supply of raw materials this year. In response to this situation, the Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee brilliantly issued a call to carry out a campaign to increase production and practice economy. The 24 million employees and the working people of the whole country enthusiastically responded to this call and continued to carry out the advanced producer movement to achieve the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy.

The total output value of key enterprises in the first quarter of this year exceeded the plan again.

Since the beginning of this year, a large-scale, in-depth, and extensive ideological and political education work of "building the country diligently and thriftily," "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," and "taking the factory as home" has been launched among employees. At the same time, under the leadership of the enterprise party, the grass-roots trade unions, together with the administrative and youth league organizations, have organized inspection teams to go deep into the masses and the actual production, investigate the waste phenomenon in enterprises, and find out the potential for increasing production and practicing economy, thereby clarifying the conservative and complacent ideas that hinder the increase in production and practice economy, such as "old-fashioned," "flash in the pan," "great development last year, no profit this year." Many grass-roots units convened employee representative conferences, and enterprise leaders explained the enterprise's production situation to the masses, fully promoting democracy, exposing enterprise waste loopholes, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and mobilizing employees to find ways to increase production and practice economy in every possible way. The wisdom of the masses is abundant, and they have put forward methods for increasing production and practicing economy from many aspects, such as modifying product design, processing technology, compressing material consumption quotas, adopting substitute materials, utilizing waste materials, reducing defective products, reducing reserves, communicating with brother factories to exchange raw materials, and improving the material distribution system. The Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory was short of 50% of its raw materials this year. The employees found sources of materials from many aspects, established mutually beneficial relationships with brother factories, exchanged needed materials with each other, collected and purchased waste materials in rural areas and markets, and made full use of substitute materials, looking for recyclable materials in the waste product warehouse, and revitalizing waste products and refurbishing old tools without affecting quality. In this way, in the first four months of this year alone, 63 kinds of substitute materials were found, 39 tons of materials needed were exchanged, 161 tons of stagnant materials were disposed of, and 130 tons of steel were saved, overcoming the shortage of raw materials, and the national plan was overfulfilled by 8.39% in the first quarter.

The Shanghai Boiler Factory put forward the slogan of saving and increasing production of ten boilers this year, and comprehensively carried out savings in every process and every product part, carefully calculating. The masses put forward more than 600 suggestions for saving raw materials, and it is estimated that the materials used for every twenty boilers can save the materials for one boiler. There is a full guarantee for saving ten boilers this year. Calculated by steel alone, 377 tons can be saved this year. Calculating each boiler at 250,000 yuan, the country can save 2.5 million yuan throughout the year. The furnace baking team of the Jiamusi Railway Sub-bureau's Locomotive Depot used waste materials to make more than 8,000 finished products, and a suggestion from Qian Limin, a young technician at the Nanshan Mine of the Hegang Coal Mine, could mine 270,000 tons more coal in the old coalfield.

Similar cases are too numerous to mention. Due to the efforts of employees across the country, in the first quarter of this year, the total output value plan of key enterprises across the country was completed by 104%, breaking the previous practice of failing to complete the national plan in the first quarter of the year.

The above facts eloquently show that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is wise and correct, and the power of the Chinese working class in the movement to increase production and practice economy and on all fronts of national construction is great, and no one is allowed to ignore it.

Bourgeois rightists, please be honest.

The bourgeois rightists shouted loudly that there was an all-round rash advance last year, and there is an all-round retreat this year. Please, gentlemen, look at the facts! Industrial growth of 31% last year, what's wrong with that? Completion of the plan by 104% in the first quarter of this year, what's wrong with that? Under the encouragement of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the working people of the whole country demanded to speed up their pace, complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and support the three major socialist transformations. This was entirely necessary. Under the circumstances of walking a little faster in some aspects last year, it is also necessary to slow down the pace this year. The occurrence of a little turbulence and some difficulties from last year to this year is due to our lack of construction experience and insufficient estimation of the new development situation. We must realize that these are shortcomings in development and difficulties in progress. As long as we accept the lessons of experience, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses, difficulties can be overcome. The preliminary victory already achieved in the movement to increase production and practice economy this year is enough to prove this. Our workers across the country have the confidence to better complete the national construction plan and lay a solid foundation for the second Five-Year Plan.

The emergence of a little turbulence in our large-scale construction is not worth making a fuss about. Compared with the Kuomintang, we are not terrible at all, but very good. The Kuomintang's decades of construction amounted to only tens of thousands of tons of steel. Including the construction of the Northeast by the Japanese, the highest was only 900,000 tons. We have only been liberated for seven or eight years, and we already have more than 4 million tons of steel. There was no machine manufacturing industry in our country's history, let alone our own cars and airplanes. Now we have them all. Haven't we built well? On the other hand, our national leaders have always attached importance to the shortcomings in construction, do not conceal the shortcomings, and are striving to make progress by constantly correcting the shortcomings.

We, the people of the whole country, have the responsibility to build a socialist motherland and help the government build the country well. We will never allow those rightists to stand outside the national construction, point fingers, and destructively blame and sabotage socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our working class across the country is full of confidence in the struggle to build a prosperous and happy socialist motherland. We want to warn those rightists that whoever dares to sabotage the construction of the motherland, we will resolutely strike at them to defend the great socialist cause of the people of the whole country and move forward victoriously!

    在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮中
    工人阶级贡献出无穷的智慧和力量
    刘长胜的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理和薄一波副总理的报告以及张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。
    从去年召开的一届三次人民代表大会到这次一届四次人民代表大会，整整的过去一年了。在这一年时间里，我国发生了巨大的变化：农业、手工业和资本主义工商业三大社会主义改造取得了伟大的胜利，社会主义建设也取得了巨大成就。这些胜利和成就是全国人民有目共睹的。中国工人阶级在自己的政党——中国共产党领导下，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮里，贡献出自己的无穷智慧和力量，涌现出千万个先进生产者，他们忘我劳动的英雄模范事迹，在国家的社会主义建设的史册上，写下了光辉的一页。
    但是资产阶级右派分子，他们闭着眼睛硬说去年国家建设全面冒进了，今年又来个全面冒退，总之在他们看来一切都闹得很乱很糟。又进一步得出这样的结论：“共产党不懂技术，不能领导国家建设”，“工人阶级没有文化，办不成大事”。他们想抹煞一年来国家的辉煌成就，抹煞共产党的正确领导，抹煞工人阶级是国家建设的强大力量。我想就这个问题发表一些意见。
    去年广大职工提出成千上万的合理化建议，为国家创造了巨大的财富
    在提前完成五年计划的口号下，中国工人阶级开展了先进生产者运动，把职工群众劳动热情进一步组织起来，引向新的高涨。去年有一百一十九万一千六百一十九个职工同志提出改进生产的合理化建议，其中工人九十四万二千八百八十人，工程技术人员十六万八千七百八十六人，共提出建议达一百八十三万一千二百一十二件，到一九五六年底已采纳九十一万九千一百九十六件；实现的并可计算价值的二十万零六百四十五件，就可为国家创造财富二亿四千一百九十七万七千六百四十三元。又据第一机械、第二机械、纺织、煤矿等十四个产业的不完全统计，去年总结推广了五千六百件先进经验；职工群众互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的技术互助运动很为活跃，先进工人帮助落后工人，老工人带新工人，上手带下手，熟手带生手，出现了兄弟合同、姐妹合同、师徒合同、一学多教合同（一个人学习几个人的特长）和一教多学合同（一个人教许多人），不但有了个人互助互学，并且有了小组与小组、车间与车间、工厂与工厂之间的互助互学。过去竞赛中十分薄弱的科室技职人员也发动起来了，仅上海市有二十多万科室人员参加了竞赛，沈阳市有一千多个科室单位参加了竞赛，不少私方实职人员也参加了竞赛。厂际竞赛有很大发展，几乎各个产业都组织了厂际竞赛，仅纺织系统参加全国厂际竞赛的就有二百一十八个单位，参加地区性厂际竞赛的有五百一十九个单位。职工群众在先进生产者运动和社会主义竞赛中充分发挥了积极性创造性，解决了很多的重大生产关键问题。如：
    汽车运输职工开展了安全节约十万公里无大修运动，在运量大而运力不足的情况下，货运量和客运量、货运周转量和客运周转量都提前一年超额完成了第一个五年计划。全国安全行驶十万公里以上的驾驶工人有四千九百八十四人，十万公里以上无大修的汽车有三千二百一十辆。一九五六年汽车用油比一九五五年实际消耗，估计节约二千八百四十三万五千公升，每条轮胎平均行驶里程比一九五五年延长了九千七百七十四公里。
    冶金工业部钢铁局系统，一九五六年由于推广了先进经验，生产钢铁十一万二千吨，其中推行了热风炉快速燃烧法以后，有百分之八十九的高炉比一九五五年平均提高了一百度，全年节约了焦炭九万六千吨，增加生铁产量四万四千吨。
    吉林铁路管理局图们工务段三道沟桥梁工区，前年发生了桥墩被河水冲袭了五分之二的情况，使往朝鲜的列车放慢了速度，到朝鲜的运输任务不能完成，并且很不安全，这时需桥梁工区在零下二十度的条件下及时检修桥梁，当时八个工人就病倒了六个，不能完成检修任务，为此发动了群众开展合理化建议运动，群众提出了十三件合理化建议，创造了好几件抢修桥墩的工具，如水中挖土器、水中捞石器、水中探测器、木制抽水机等，解决了桥墩检修中十二个大的关键问题。原来领导上计划去年只完成四个桥墩的检修任务，结果完成了二十四个，超过国家计划五倍，提前完成了一九五七年的计划，给国家创造了二万多元的财富。这个经验推广后，吉林铁路管理局的桥梁检修任务，去年一年已完成一九五九年的工作量。
    煤矿系统推广了一班采煤法以后，一般提高了采煤效率百分之二十，最高达到百分之五十。
    全国人民都为去年工业生产的迅速发展而欢呼
    去年工业总值比一九五五年增长了百分之三十一，是近年来工业生产增长速度最快的一年，取得提前一年并且超额百分之九点五完成了五年计划的巨大成就。去年是我国社会主义建设跃进发展的一年，这是广大工人群众努力的成果，离开了他们，我国的建设是不可想像的。去年全国范围内评选出先进工作者八十四万二千零二十五人，先进工作者四十一万六千九百五十一人，共一百二十五万八千九百七十六人；先进单位共十一万四千一百六十一个，其中先进车间一万二千四百八十八个，先进工段四千四百零五个，先进小组八万一千一百零五个，先进职能单位一万六千一百六十三个。
    以上事实说明了，去年先进生产者运动取得了很大成绩，全国人民无不额手称庆。同时，我们也要看到，去年建设的大发展，某些指标大了一点，影响今年的原材料供应，党中央二中全会针对这一情况，英明的发出了开展增产节约运动的号召。全国二千四百万职工和全国劳动人民一起热烈的响应这个号召，以继续开展先进生产者运动来实现增产节约的目的。
    今年第一季度重点企业的总产值又超额完成了计划
    今年以来，在职工群众中展开了规模宏大的深入广泛的“勤俭建国”、“勤俭办企业”、“以厂为家”的思想政治教育工作，同时基层工会在企业党的领导下，协同行政、青年团组织检查组，深入群众、深入生产实际，调查企业浪费现象，摸清增产节约的潜力，从而澄清了认为增产节约“老一套”、“一阵风”、“去年大发展、今年无油水”等保守自满阻碍增产节约的思想。不少基层召开职工代表大会，企业领导将企业生产情况向群众摊牌交底，充分发扬民主，揭发企业浪费漏洞，开展批评自我批评，动员职工群众千方百计的寻找增产节约的途径。群众智慧是丰富的，纷纷从修改产品设计、加工工艺、压缩材料消耗定额、采用代用材料、利用废旧料、减少废品、减少储备量、与兄弟厂互通有无交换原材料、改善发料制度等方面提出增产节约的办法。西安农业机械厂今年原材料缺少百分之五十，职工群众多方面寻找材料来源，与兄弟厂建立互通有无的关系，互相交换需要的材料，到农村和市场上收集购买废旧料，充分利用代用料，在废品库中寻找可以回用的材料，在不影响质量前提下，把废品复活、旧工具翻新，这样仅今年前四个月找到代用料六十三种，交换了需用的材料三十九吨，处理呆料一百六十一吨，节约钢材一百三十吨，克服了原材料紧张局面，第一季超额百分之八点三九完成了国家计划。
    上海锅炉厂今年提出节约增产十台锅炉的口号，每道工序每个产品零件精打细算的全面进行节约，群众提出节约原材料建议六百多条，估计每二十台锅炉用料可节约出一台锅炉的材料，今年节约十台锅炉有了充分保证。仅钢材一项计算，今年可节约三百七十七吨，每台锅炉以二十五万元计算，全年可为国家节约二百五十万元。佳木斯铁路分局机务段烘炉组利用废料制作八千多件成品，鹤岗煤矿南山矿青年技术员钱立民一项建议在旧煤田里可多采二十七万吨煤。
    类似上述事例是不胜枚举的，由于全国职工的努力，今年第一季度，全国重点企业总产值计划完成了百分之一百零四，打破了以往历年第一季度完不成国家计划的惯例。
    以上事实雄辩地说明了，中国共产党领导是英明的、正确的，中国工人阶级在增产节约运动中、在国家建设的各个战线上的力量的伟大，不允许任何人漠视的。
    资产阶级右派先生们还是老实些吧
    资产阶级右派分子大嚷大叫去年全面冒进了，今年全面冒退了，请这些先生们看看事实吧！去年工业增长了百分之三十一，有什么不好？今年第一季度完成计划百分之一百零四，又有什么不好？去年全国劳动人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的鼓舞下要求放快一些脚步，提前完成五年计划，支持三大社会主义改造是完全必要的，在去年某些方面走快一点的情况下，今年把脚步放慢一点，也是必要的。去年到今年发生了一点小的波折，产生了一些困难，这是由于我们的建设经验不足和对新的发展情况估计不足所造成的。我们要认识到，这是发展中的缺点，前进中的困难，只要我们接受经验教训，依靠群众，发动群众，困难是可以克服的，今年增产节约运动已经取得初步胜利就足以证明。我们全国工人群众有信心更好地完成国家建设计划，为第二个五年计划打下坚强基础。
    我国大规模的建设中，出现一点小的波折，本来不值得大惊小怪，比起国民党来，我们不是糟得很，而是好得很。国民党几十年的建设不过几万吨钢，把东北日本人建设的包括在内，最高不过九十万吨，我们解放仅是七、八年，已有四百多万吨钢了。我国历史上没有机器制造业，更没有自己的汽车、飞机，现在都有了，难道我们没有建设好？另一方面，我们国家领导人从来重视建设中的缺点，不隐讳缺点，并且在努力不断改正缺点中求前进。
    建设社会主义祖国，我们全国人民有责任，帮助政府把国家建设好，决不允许那些右派分子站在国家建设之外，指手划脚，一味消极责难来破坏社会主义建设。
    我们全国工人阶级，在中国共产党领导下，满怀信心地为繁荣幸福的社会主义祖国建设奋斗，我们要警告那些右派分子，谁敢于破坏祖国建设，我们要给以坚决打击，来保卫全国人民伟大的社会主义事业，胜利前进！
