    Farmers Should Correctly Approach Grain Retention Standards

    On July 19th, the New Hunan Daily published an editorial entitled "Talking to Farmers About the Current Grain Situation." The editorial criticized erroneous arguments such as "farmers' grain retention standards are too low" and "only considering personal needs."

    The editorial stated that in Hunan Province last year, grain sales in rural areas were higher than in 1954, which was a year of severe flooding, yet many farmers were complaining about insufficient grain. Some people said: The current grain retention standards are too low, and it should be closer to 700 or 800 *jin* per person. Some individuals even said: This year, we will sell grain to the state only after we have used and eaten enough ourselves. This kind of argument already involves the question of whether or not the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is necessary.

    "The current grain retention standards are too low." The editorial believes that this statement depends on how it is said. Because our country has been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for a long time, our productivity is still relatively backward today, so the average ration standard per person is indeed not high. But if it is said that the ration standard after liberation is lower than before liberation, that is not correct. According to a survey by the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 1936 before liberation was the year with the highest consumption of living materials in history. In that year, the average grain consumption per farmer in our province was 476 *jin*, while 1956 after liberation was a year of unprecedented drought in nearly a century, and the average grain consumption per farmer in our province was 565 *jin*. How can it be said to be lower than before liberation? Of course, the significant increase in grain consumption mentioned here refers to the vast majority of farmers, especially poor farmers. As for the grain consumption of landlords and rich peasants, compared with their situation before liberation, it is, and should be, reduced.

    "Each person retaining 700 or 800 *jin* is about right." If this sentence is regarded as a wish of farmers to develop production and improve their lives, it is of course understandable. However, we must proceed from reality. What is the actual situation in our country? Taking grain production as an example, production has been gradually developing in the years since liberation. According to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, the national grain output has increased by more than 70% in the past seven years. In 1949, the total national grain output (excluding soybeans) was 216.2 billion *jin*, with an average of only 408 *jin* of grain per person nationwide. In 1956, the total national grain output (excluding soybeans) was about 365 billion *jin*, with an average of 584 *jin* per person nationwide. Of course, this includes rations, seeds, feed, industrial grain, export grain, and so on. This calculation shows that the current grain production situation in our country is still not abundant. In terms of average grain consumption per person, Hunan farmers' grain consumption has long been close to, or even exceeded, this level. Based on the current grain production situation, it should be satisfactory to be able to reach this standard of consumption. The editorial pointed out that to improve life and eat more grain, it can only come slowly with the development of production. It is impossible to "become a big fat person with one bite."

    "After we have eaten and used enough ourselves, we will sell grain to the state." This sentence is completely wrong. People who say this are also rejecting the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Just think, if the state cannot control grain, what will it use for construction? What will it use to support the people in cities and industrial and mining areas? What will it use to support farmers in disaster-stricken areas? In a word, what will it use to build socialism? If a socialist society cannot be built, how can the people's lives be fundamentally improved? In fact, this is also a question of whether or not to have socialism. Every farmer should think carefully about it. The purpose of the state's implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy of grain is to make a reasonable distribution in the case of insufficient grain. If this is not done, it will inevitably lead to some people eating their fill while others go hungry; some eating more when there is a good harvest this year and starving next year when there is a disaster; people in rural areas having enough to eat while people in cities and industrial and mining areas have nothing to eat; ... In the final analysis, it is soaring prices, chaos in the world, and people living in misery, let alone any construction. Recalling those painful days before liberation, you will not say those words of "forgetting the pain once the scar is healed."

    The editorial demanded that those people with "eyes like rats, seeing only an inch" should not only see the present, only see their own family, and not see the future, and not care about the major affairs of the country.

### 农民要正确对待留粮标准

    农民要正确对待留粮标准
    7月19日新湖南报以“和农民谈谈当前粮食情况”为题发表社论。社论就“农民留粮标准太低”以及“只管个人需要”等错误论点作了批判。
    社论说，湖南省去年，农村的粮食销售量比遭受大水灾的1954年还要多，但农民中叫喊粮食不够的却为数不少。有些人说：现在的留粮标准太低了，每人留七、八百斤还差不多。个别的人甚至说：今年要等我们自己用够了、吃够了，再把粮食卖给国家。这种论调已经牵涉到粮食的统购统销政策要不要的问题。
    “现在的留粮标准太低了。”社论认为，这句话要看怎样说。由于我们国家被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期压迫和剥削，以致今天我们的生产力还相当落后，所以现在每人平均的口粮标准的确不高。但如果说，解放以后口粮标准比解放前低了，那是不对的。据湖南省统计局的调查，解放前的1936年是历史上生活资料消费量最高的一年，那一年我省农民平均每人消费的粮食是四百七十六斤，而解放后的1956年是遭受了近百年来未有的旱灾的一年，我省农民平均每人消费的粮食却是五百六十五斤。这怎么能够说比解放前还低呢？当然，这里所说的用粮数量显著提高的，是指广大的农民特别是贫农，至于地主、富农的用粮数量，与他们解放前的情况相比，自然是、也应该是降低了。
    “每人留七、八百斤还差不多。”这句话如果把它当作农民要求发展生产、改善生活的一种愿望，那当然是可以理解的。但是，我们必须从实际出发。我们国家的实际情况是怎么样呢？拿粮食生产来说，解放几年来生产是在逐步发展的，据国家统计局的材料，七年来全国粮食产量增长了70％以上。1949年全国粮食总产量（除去大豆）是二千一百六十二亿斤，全国平均每人只有粮食四百零八斤。1956年全国粮食总产量（除去大豆）约三千六百五十亿斤，全国平均每人有五百八十四斤。当然，这都是连同口粮、种子、饲料、工业用粮、出口粮等等在内的。这笔账一算，说明我国目前的粮食生产情况还是不宽裕的；从每人平均用粮数量来说，湖南农民的用粮早已经接近于有的甚至超过了这个水平，根据目前粮食生产情况，消费能够达到这个标准是应该满意了。社论指出要改善生活，多吃粮食，只有随着生产的发展慢慢地来，“一口吃成个大胖子”是办不到的。
    “等我们自己吃够了用够了，再把粮食卖给国家。”这句话是完全错误的。说这种话的人，也就是不要粮食统购统销政策了。试想想，国家不能掌握粮食，拿什么去搞建设呢？拿什么去支援城市、工矿区的人民呢？拿什么去支援受灾区的农民呢？总的一句话，拿什么去建设社会主义，不能建设社会主义社会，又怎么能从根本上改善人民的生活呢？实际上，这也就是要不要社会主义的问题。每个农民都要好好想一想。国家实行了粮食的统购统销政策的目的，是在粮食还不宽裕的情况下，作合理的分配。不这样必然会使有的人吃得很饱，有的人饿着肚子；有的今年丰收吃得多，明年遭灾就饿饭；农村里的人有吃，城市里、工矿区的人没有吃；……归根结底，是物价飞涨，天下大乱，民不聊生，当然更谈不上什么建设。回忆一下解放前那种痛苦的日子，就不会讲那些“好了疮疤忘了痛”的话了。
    社论要求那些“老鼠眼睛一寸光”的人，不要只看到眼前，只看到自己一家人，看不到将来，不去管国家的大事。
