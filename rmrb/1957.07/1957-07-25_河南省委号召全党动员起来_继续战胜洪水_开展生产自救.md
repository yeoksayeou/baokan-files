    Henan Provincial Party Committee Calls on the Entire Party to Mobilize
    Continue to Overcome Floods　Carry Out Production for Self-Relief
    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, July 24th) The Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the morning of the 23rd to study production and disaster relief issues. The meeting believed that the characteristic of this year's disaster situation in Henan Province is that the summer famine has not yet passed, and the autumn disaster has already arrived, and now the flood season has just begun, and there is still the possibility of various disasters in the future. To this end, the meeting decided that the central task of the province at present is: on the one hand, to unremittingly continue to fight to overcome floods; on the other hand, to promptly lead the masses in the disaster areas to vigorously carry out production for self-relief, and at the same time, to lead the masses in non-disaster areas to overfulfill the agricultural production increase plan to ensure a bumper autumn harvest. The meeting called on the entire Party to mobilize urgently, seize the opportunity, and quickly launch a province-wide production self-relief movement. In addition to deciding that economic departments should vigorously support disaster areas, the meeting also called on non-disaster area residents to save food, store cattle grass, and support disaster areas.
    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, July 24th) From the 21st to 10:00 am on the 24th of this month, there was basically no rain in other areas of Henan Province except for some areas of Xinxiang and Anyang special districts on the evening of the 24th. At the same time, the water levels of the main rivers such as the Sha, Hong, and Ru rivers all tended to fall. Taking advantage of the interval between rain stopping and water receding, all localities are vigorously rushing to block breaches and repair dangerous works; on the other hand, they are vigorously rescuing and rushing to plant and replant late autumn crops. In order to support the farmers in the flood-stricken areas to rush to plant and replant, the Henan Provincial People's Committee has allocated more than 24 million jin of various late autumn and vegetable seeds on the 21st of this month, and allocated 1.3 million yuan of loans to the disaster areas the next day.

    河南省委号召全党动员起来
    继续战胜洪水　开展生产自救
    本报郑州24日电　中共河南省委常委于23日上午开会研究生产和救灾问题。会议认为今年河南省的灾情特点是夏荒未过，秋灾又来，而现在汛期刚才开始，今后仍有出现各种灾害的可能。为此，会议决定目前全省的中心任务是：一方面坚持不懈地继续为战胜洪水而斗争；另一方面及时领导灾区群众大力进行生产自救，同时，领导非灾区群众超额完成农业增产计划，保证秋季大丰收。会议要求全党紧急动员起来，抓紧时机，迅速开展全省规模的生产自救运动。会议除决定经济部门要大力支援灾区外，还号召非灾区群众节约粮食，储备牛草，支援灾区。
    本报郑州24日电　本月21日至24日上午十时，河南省除新乡、安阳专区部分地区24日晚有雨外，其它专区基本无雨。同时沙、洪、汝等主要河道水位均趋下落。趁雨停水落间隙，各地一面大力抢堵决口，整修险工；一面大力抢救和抢种、补种晚秋。河南省人民委员会为了支援遭受水灾地区农民的抢种补种，已于本月21日拨发各种晚秋和蔬菜种籽二千四百多万斤，并于次日拨发灾区贷款一百三十万元。
