	Since July, some areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Henan, and Liaoning provinces have suffered from heavy rain and flooding, submerging most of the seedlings. The cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province have also suffered from severe insect pests. To support disaster areas in draining floodwater, replanting crops, and controlling insect pests, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has increased the allocation of 40,500 tons of chemical fertilizer from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places to the aforementioned areas.
	The Ministry of Communications, in order to transport chemical fertilizer in a timely manner, has issued instructions to the Shanghai Port, which is currently congested with loading and unloading, to prioritize the unloading of chemical fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer transported by rail and sea has also been given priority for loading. With the strong support of the transportation departments, 15,000 tons of chemical fertilizer have already been continuously transported to the disaster areas. The remaining 25,500 tons are being actively expedited.

    运肥料
    7月以来，江苏、浙江、山东、河南、辽宁等省部分地区，暴雨成灾，大部禾苗被淹。山西省棉产区亦遭受严重虫害。为支援灾区排水抢种和扑虫害，供销合作总社已从上海、天津、沈阳、大连等地增调化学肥料四万零五百吨到上述地区去。
    中央交通部为了及时调运化肥，已对目前装卸拥塞的上海港发出了优先抢卸化学肥料的指示。经铁路、海路运输的化学肥料，亦已得到优先装运的照顾。在交通部门大力支持下，目前已有一万五千吨化学肥料源源运往灾区。尚有二万五千五百吨正在积极赶运中。
