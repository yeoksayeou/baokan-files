    Why are cement paper bags brittle?
    Recently, we have received many letters from the public reflecting that the current cement packaging paper bags are brittle, and the damage is severe during handling, resulting in waste of cement. These comrades requested a rapid improvement in the quality of paper bags and an increase in the number of paper bag layers. At the same time, they also proposed using substitutes such as burlap sacks, cloth bags, straw bags, and rush mats, as well as recycling old bags. We thank these comrades for their valuable suggestions and have notified the relevant enterprises to find ways to improve.
    The reasons for the damage to cement packaging are, firstly, poor operating methods for pasting and sewing paper bags, and failure to properly clean vehicles before loading. Secondly, due to insufficient raw materials, the number of paper bag layers had to be changed from four to three, and the quality of the paper is also low, so it is easily damaged. In the first and second quarters of this year, we only met 72% of the cement bag paper we needed. We have asked the Ministry of Light Industry to increase production and improve the quality of the paper.
    In order to solve the shortage of raw materials for cement packaging paper, we have formulated a draft method for recycling old paper bags, which is being submitted to the State Council for approval. The State Council is organizing relevant departments to actively promote bulk cement transportation and collective container transportation methods. Regarding the use of substitutes, in view of the shortage of cloth and burlap sacks, or limited to the production equipment of enterprises, it is difficult to achieve. We hope that units using cement will pay attention to the handling and unpacking of cement, so that old paper bags can be reused. We also hope that the relevant transportation departments, especially the loading and unloading workers at water-land intermodal transport and railway transfer stations, will handle and transport cement gently to minimize damage to cement paper bags.

### 水泥纸袋为什么发脆？

    水泥纸袋为什么发脆？
    最近我们接到许多人民来信，反映目前水泥包装纸袋发脆，在搬运过程中破损严重，造成水泥的浪费。这些同志要求迅速改进纸袋质量，增加纸袋层数。同时，还提出使用麻袋、布袋、草袋、蒲包等代用品和旧袋回收等建议。我们感谢这些同志们提出的宝贵意见，已通知各企业设法改进。
    水泥包装破损的原因，首先是糊制、缝制纸袋的操作方法不好，装车前的车辆清扫工作没作好。其次，由于原料不足，纸袋层数不得不由四层改为三层，加之纸的质量低，所以容易破损。今年第一、二季度我们所需要的水泥袋纸，仅满足了72％。我们已经要求轻工业部增加产量和提高纸的质量。
    为了解决水泥包装用纸原料的不足，我们已制定了旧纸袋回收办法草案，正报请国务院审批中。国务院正在组织有关部门积极推行散装水泥运输和集体装箱运输的办法。关于使用代用品的问题，鉴于布、麻袋也紧张，或限于企业的生产设备，所以都难以实现。我们希望使用水泥的单位，注意水泥的搬运和拆袋工作，使旧纸袋能够再次利用。还希望有关运输部门，特别是水陆联运和铁路中转车站的装卸职工同志们，在装卸和搬运水泥工作中轻拿轻放，尽量减少水泥纸袋的破损。
