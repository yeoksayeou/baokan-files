In the rectification campaign, "Drama Gazette" examines errors of intentionally exaggerating shortcomings and erasing achievements

Beijing News. Under the leadership of the Party organization of the Chinese Dramatists Association, the editorial department of the "Drama Gazette" recently held three general staff meetings to examine the main errors made by the journal since the start of the rectification movement.

During this period, the errors of the "Drama Gazette" were, first of all, the one-sided exaggeration of the contradictions and shortcomings of state-owned theater troupes, erasing achievements, and losing the balance of praise and criticism. For example, "What contradictions exist in the China Peking Opera Theater?" and two articles criticizing the China Peking Opera Theater in the same period, the former was only the opinion of a few actors at a symposium, but it was generalized as the opinion of all the actors of the entire Peking Opera Theater. Another example is the article "The General Political Department Drama Troupe Exposes Contradictions," the reporter made an objectivist report based on some speeches with personal emotions at a symposium, distorting the General Political Department Drama Troupe as a group with "three dissatisfactions" among the troops, the masses, and the actors. Also, the article "Opinions of Shanghai Opera Actors" made an exaggerated description of the contradictions between the old and new state-owned theater troupes in Shanghai, which was also detrimental to the unity of the Shanghai opera circles.

Secondly, it only cared about sensationalism regardless of the truth. For example, "Spring thunder rumbled in Tianjin's drama circles," "Quju needs sunshine and rain," "Appeals of folk Pingju artists," etc. were all objectivist reports with extreme one-sidedness. Another example is the article "The Dilemma of Stage Art Workers" written by Zhao Senlin and others, which did not proceed from the desire for unity, and the criticism of the leadership was not only inconsistent with the facts, but some were even fabricated.

In addition to the above reports, the tenth issue also published an editorial entitled "Boldly Expose Contradictions, Implement the Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." When talking about the issue of fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, it made a wrong explanation, such as saying: "Now we should use more effort to irrigate our garden and support all kinds of flowers, instead of rushing to find those few poisonous weeds, let alone hastily uprooting them." When mentioning the existing problems in the current drama work, the editorial said that "the most prominent problem is in the national grand theater," obliterating the many significant achievements of the national theater troupe in carrying out national tasks, improving art, and reforming the thinking of artists, and also exaggerating the contradictions between actors and leaders, and between private theater troupes and state-owned theater troupes. The editorial also said that "we have a blank in the field of drama theory," which unfairly negated the many activities and achievements in drama theory criticism in recent years.

During this period, the editorial department of the "Drama Gazette" intentionally released a few poisonous weeds, such as Wu Zuguang's "On the Leadership of Drama Work," etc., but did not recognize the seriousness of its errors, nor did it organize criticism in a timely manner, which caused ideological confusion in the drama circles to a certain extent. In the twelfth issue, it also published an article "My Opinion on Hebei Bangzi Killing the Son to Avenge," wrongly saying that this play was a play with a "general tendency that is not bad" and "anti-anti-humanity," and regarded poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers.

In this serious struggle, the reason why the "Drama Gazette" made these mistakes is that the bourgeois editorial thinking and style that has long existed in some editors and reporters of the editorial department has not been deeply transformed; some people who originally had right-wing ideas even took the opportunity of the bourgeois rightists' rampant attack on the Party to stir up trouble, looking for "dark sides" everywhere, and creating contradictions. The three old artists' interview notes written by the journal's reporter Tang Shi (pen name Yang He) were written under such erroneous ideological emotions.

The editorial department of the "Drama Gazette" is currently conducting a sharp struggle against right-wing thoughts within the editorial department under the leadership of the Party organization of the Theatrical Association.

### 在整风中有意夸大缺点抹杀成绩  “戏剧报”检查错误

    在整风中有意夸大缺点抹杀成绩
    “戏剧报”检查错误
    本报讯　戏剧报编辑部在中国戏剧家协会党组织的领导下，最近举行了三次全体工作人员大会，检查该刊自整风运动开始以来所犯的主要错误。
    在这一时期里，戏剧报的错误，首先是片面地夸大国营剧团的矛盾和缺点，抹煞成绩，失去褒贬的权衡。如“中国京剧院有哪些矛盾？”和同期的两篇批评中国京剧院的文章，前者仅仅是一次座谈会上少数演员的意见，却概括为整个京剧院演员的意见。又如“总政话剧团揭露矛盾”一文，记者根据座谈会上一些带有个人情绪的发言，作了客观主义的报道，歪曲地把总政话剧团描写成部队、群众、演员“三不满”的团体。还有“上海戏曲演员的意见”一文，对上海新老国营剧团之间的矛盾作了夸大的描写，也是不利于上海戏曲界的团结的。
    其次是只顾耸人听闻不顾真实，如“天津戏剧界响起了春雷”，“曲剧需要阳光雨露”“民间评剧艺人的申述”等等都是有极大片面性的客观主义的报道。又如赵森林等写的“舞台美术工作者的苦衷”一文，不从团结愿望出发，对领导进行的批评，不但有不少与事实不符，有的更是出于捏造。
    除了上述报道外，在第十期上还刊登了题为“大胆揭露矛盾，贯彻百家争鸣”的社论。在谈到香花毒草的问题时，作了错误的解释，如说：“现在应该用更多的力量去灌溉我们的园地，扶植百花，而不要忙着去找那几棵毒草，更不用慌忙去拔掉它。”提到当前戏剧工作存在的问题时，社论说“最突出的问题是在国家大剧院中”，抹煞国家剧团在执行国家任务，改进艺术，改造艺人思想上许多重大成绩，也夸大了演员对领导，民营剧团对国营剧团的矛盾。社论又说“在戏剧理论方面我们是一片空白”，极不公正地否定了几年来戏剧理论批评上的许多活动和成就。
    在这一时期，戏剧报编辑部虽有意放出了几棵毒草，如吴祖光的“谈戏剧工作的领导问题”等，但没有认识它的错误的严重性，也没有及时组织批评，在一定程度上引起了戏剧界的思想混乱。在第十二期上，还发表了一篇“我看河北梆子杀子报”，错误地把这出戏说成是“反反人性”的“总的倾向并不是坏的”戏，把毒草也看成香花了。
    在这次严重的斗争中，戏剧报之所以犯这些错误，是因为编辑部一部分编辑记者中，长期存在的资产阶级的编辑思想和作风没有得到深刻改造；某些原来就有右派思想的人，甚至趁资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的机会，兴风作浪，到处找寻“黑暗面”，制造矛盾。该刊记者唐湜（笔名杨和）所写的三篇老艺人访问记就是在这样的错误思想情绪下写成的。
    戏剧报编辑部目前正在剧协党组织的领导下，向编辑部内的右派思想进行尖锐的斗争。
