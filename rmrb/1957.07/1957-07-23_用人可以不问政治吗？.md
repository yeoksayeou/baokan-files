Since the beginning of the rectification campaign, many people have offered numerous suggestions and criticisms regarding the cadre policy of the Party and the People's Government, and the personnel work of certain organizations, schools, enterprises, and groups. These suggestions and criticisms fall into two categories. In one case, the opinions are correct, or basically correct. These opinions point out that certain departments do have serious shortcomings and urgent problems to be solved in the examination, appointment, and treatment of cadres, in the methods and means of cadre management, in the selection of personnel work cadres, and in the sectarian tendencies and accommodationist inclinations towards non-Party cadres. These opinions should be listened to, studied, and adopted earnestly. Such opinions will actively promote the improvement of personnel work. In the other case, the opinions are wrong. These opinions negate the principles of the cadre policy of the Party and the People's Government and the achievements of personnel work. According to these opinions, things seem to have been messed up, most of the responsible cadres, especially the middle and lower-level cadres, seem to be incompetent, everything seems to have been ruined by the personnel system, and everything seems to have been ruined by emphasizing the political situation of the cadres, resulting in "valuing virtue over talent," not "appointing people according to their abilities," and not "recruiting talents in various ways." This is the opinion of the bourgeois rightists, and this opinion must be resolutely rejected and refuted.

The consistent standard for selecting cadres by the Party and the People's Government has been to consider both virtue and talent, or to emphasize both political situation and professional ability. Cadres are supposed to do work, so of course professional ability should be emphasized. But people are not machines. Machines can serve whoever holds them, but people's actions are governed by their own thoughts. When classes still exist in the human world, a person's class stand plays a decisive role in their political behavior. Even if a landlord is highly educated and knows everything about poetry, songs, calligraphy, and painting, they cannot lead land reform, nor can they lead agricultural cooperatives. Similarly, no matter how efficient a capitalist is, they cannot lead the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, nor can they lead the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Only the advanced elements of the working class, the working peasants, and the revolutionary intellectuals who are combined with workers and peasants, can form the backbone of the proletarian dictatorship. Only those who ideologically support or at least sympathize with socialism can faithfully serve the cause of socialism. Therefore, the cadre policy and personnel work of the Party and the People's Government are not ordinary administrative affairs, but principled issues that concern the fate of the country and affect the nature of the state power. During the revolutionary period, this issue is particularly important. The success or failure of the revolution depends on which class has obtained and controlled the state power, and which political forces have formed the government. All those who oppose the cadre policy of the Party and the People's Government, and oppose the emphasis on the political situation when employing people, have precisely forgotten or deliberately "forgotten" this point.

Any state power in history is based on a certain class and a certain political force. If socialist countries differ from capitalist countries on this issue, it is that socialist countries openly point this out, while capitalist countries often try to disguise themselves as "national" states. As early as 1848, Marx and Engels pointed out in the Communist Manifesto: "The first step in the workers' revolution is to raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class to win the battle of democracy." After the experience of the Paris Commune in 1871, Marx further pointed out that "the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes." That is to say, the working class must replace the old state machinery with new people, new organizations, and new methods. Lenin greatly developed the Marxist theory of the state in theory and practice, and under his leadership, the world's first state led by the working class was established. The People's Republic of China is also such a state led by the working class. Even before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Summing up our experience and focusing it on one point, it is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Article 1 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China also clearly states: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." There is no ambiguity here. The personnel work of the People's Government, of course, has the responsibility to select cadres according to the political standards of the working class, and of course has the responsibility to ensure that the composition of our state organs truly conforms to the provisions of the Constitution, is led by the working class, and is based on the alliance of workers and peasants.

In "State and Revolution," Lenin once described the essence of the proletarian dictatorship in this way: "Marx's doctrine of the class struggle, when applied by him to the question of the state and of the socialist revolution, leads inevitably to the recognition of the political rule of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e., of power shared with none and relying directly upon the armed force of the masses. The overthrow of the bourgeoisie is possible only through the proletariat being transformed into the ruling class, capable of crushing the inevitable desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organising all the toiling and exploited masses for the new economic system." Of course, what is said here about not sharing power with anyone does not mean that the proletariat does not unite with the broad masses of non-proletarians in state power, nor does it mean that the proletariat does not need to make full use of all the experts and technicians who were educated in the old society but are willing to build socialism with the working people in economic and cultural work, but rather that it does not share the leadership of power with anyone. In our country, due to specific historical conditions, not only the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary intellectuals participate in the power led by the proletariat, but also bourgeois elements and bourgeois political activists. In this case, the task of the People's Government in selecting cadres is particularly heavy and complex. For the sake of the socialist cause, in order to ensure that the proletariat's leadership over the entire state power is not shaken, it is necessary to understand the political history, political tendencies, and political qualities of cadres from different backgrounds and experiences, and to make appropriate arrangements based on the political situation and professional ability of the cadres. Isn't this necessity very clear? If not, if we use cadres in a muddle-headed way as some people advocate, without a personnel system, so that important responsibilities are entrusted to some people with unclear political faces and ulterior motives, then the socialist cause will be in danger, and the people's democratic regime will be in danger. Isn't this principle also very clear?

Those who oppose emphasizing the political situation of cadres often describe the so-called "virtue" as something abstract, or make it mysterious and unpredictable, or describe it as the embodiment of sectarianism that excludes dissidents. This is of course a distortion. In fact, as mentioned earlier, in our state organs (not to mention economic and cultural organizations), according to the united front policy, the policy of "embracing" the old personnel, and the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, a large number of people who had little connection with the revolution in the past or even stood on the opposite side have been accommodated, as everyone knows. However, the socialist state led by the working class cannot but put forward certain political requirements for its staff. Although the past history is very different, it is necessary to review it clearly; although past political views may be reserved, it is necessary to accept socialism and the people's democratic system now.

Article 18 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "All personnel of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and the law, and strive to serve the people." This stipulates the minimum "virtue" that our country requires of all staff. The state must strictly abide by this standard when selecting and evaluating staff, and must also strictly abide by this standard when training and educating staff. Those who oppose emphasizing the political situation of cadres also oppose conducting political education in schools, and oppose paying attention to political conditions when enrolling students in universities and sending students to study abroad. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that some comrades in the Ministry of Higher Education seem to think that the criticism of "emphasizing politics and neglecting professional work" is correct, and seem to think that it is possible to send students to study abroad without asking about politics, and to treat everyone "equally" (see the first page of this newspaper on May 29). It is of course wrong to neglect professional work, but what is wrong with emphasizing politics? Sending students to study abroad, as well as recruiting and training students in universities, and assigning graduates from universities, are all of great importance to the cause of the people. How can we not pay attention to politics? In fact, any regime in the world has political standards in selecting and training talents. The only difference is that each has specific content, and there are differences between supporting the interests of the working people and opposing the interests of the working people. There is no country in the world that truly ignores the political situation of cadres. Those arguments that demand so-called appointment of people according to their abilities and demand that personnel appointments disregard the political situation from the Party and the People's Government are either due to opposition to the socialist cause and the proletarian dictatorship, or due to political ignorance.

Rightist elements viciously attack the personnel work departments of the Party and the People's Government, calling them "dens of sectarianism" and "halls of hell." Their hatred of personnel work departments shows how important personnel work is in the class struggle. It is true that some staff in the personnel work departments lack sufficient knowledge and experience, and their methods and means of work must have many important improvements. They have also made some errors, large or small, in the selection and promotion of cadres, which must be corrected in a practical way. However, in general, the line implemented by the personnel work departments is in line with the interests of the people, and their arduous work in the eight years since the founding of the country has achieved great success. This is an undeniable fact. The Party and the People's Government have promoted a large number of outstanding figures from workers, peasants, women, youth, "petty intellectuals," "those who wear broken shoes," and various others who were insulted and harmed in the old society, to the political stage of our country and to important positions on various fronts, making them the backbone of our country. Was this wrong? If it were not for their hard work and their close connection with the broad masses of the people, could our country have so thoroughly completed democratic reforms, achieved national unity and national solidarity, and carried out the socialist revolution so smoothly? If it were not for their unyielding efforts together with the people, could our country have so effectively overcome serious difficulties in all aspects, and could our construction cause have progressed so rapidly? Although the bureaucratic organs of the old era were full of "talented people," they could never escape from the ugly phenomena of embezzlement, appointment of relatives, corruption, fraud, and oppression of the masses. Hasn't this phenomenon been basically eliminated in our state organs? We have already formed a new type of state organ that serves the working people. This basic fact proves that the cadre policy of the Party and the People's Government is correct and successful. Of course, it should be pointed out that all the achievements of our construction cause, including the labor achievements of technical experts in various fields, include the labor achievements of civil servants who came from the old society but are truly loyal to the new society. But they have all gained the opportunity to serve the motherland. Doesn't this fact prove that our personnel work departments have not excluded staff from non-working people backgrounds, and have not implemented a sectarian line of "appointing people based on their Party affiliation"?

There are sectarian tendencies in our personnel work. One of the tasks of the Party's rectification movement is to fight against this harmful, non-working-class, non-socialist tendency. But opposing sectarianism does not mean that personnel appointments can disregard politics. On the contrary, while opposing sectarianism, we must also fight against the tendency inside and outside the Party that believes that personnel appointments can disregard politics. Only in this way can we implement the principle of considering both virtue and talent, and can we achieve the goals of the rectification movement on the issue of personnel work. Abolishing the political standards of loyalty to the people, loyalty to people's democracy, and loyalty to socialism will inevitably lead to another political standard that only benefits a few people. That is not only a political standard of thorough sectarianism, but also, according to the objective laws of history, it must be a reactionary, anti-people, and anti-socialist political standard.

### 用人可以不问政治吗？

    用人可以不问政治吗？
    从整风运动开始以来，许多人对于党和人民政府的干部政策，对于某些机关、学校、企业和团体的人事工作，提出了不少的建议和批评。这些建议和批评有两种情况。一种情况，意见是正确的，或者基本上是正确的。这些意见指出了某些部门在干部的考察、任用和待遇上，在干部管理的方法方式和人事工作干部的人选上，在对待非党干部的宗派主义倾向和迁就主义倾向上，确实有严重的缺点和急待解决的问题。对于这种意见应当认真地倾听、研究和采纳。这种意见将积极促进人事工作的改善。另一种情况，意见是错误的。这种意见否定了党和人民政府的干部政策的原则和人事工作的成绩。按照这种意见，似乎事情都搞糟了，似乎大多数负责干部特别是中下级干部都不称职，似乎事情都坏在有了人事制度，都坏在重视了干部的政治情况，因而弄得“重德不重才”，没有“任人唯才”，没有“不拘一格用人才”。这是资产阶级右派的意见，对于这种意见必须加以坚决的拒绝和驳斥。
    党和人民政府历来的选择干部的标准就是德才兼顾，或者说既重视政治情况，又重视业务能力。干部是要做工作的，当然应当注重业务能力。但是人不是机器。机器可以掌握在谁的手里就为谁服务，人的一举一动都受着自己的思想所支配。在人类世界还存在着阶级的时候，人的阶级立场对于人的政治行为具有决定的作用。地主纵然文化很高，诗词歌赋琴棋书画可以无所不晓，但是决不能领导土地改革，也决不能领导农业合作社。同样，资本家办事无论如何有效率，决不能领导“三反”和“五反”，决不能领导社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业。只有工人、劳动农民以及同工农相结合的革命知识分子中的经过考验的先进分子，才能组成无产阶级专政的骨干。只有在思想上拥护或者至少同情社会主义的人，才能忠实地为社会主义事业服务。因此，党和人民政府的干部政策和人事工作，不是普通的行政事务问题，而是关系国家命运、影响国家政权性质的原则问题。在革命时期，这个问题尤其具有特别重大的意义。革命的成功或者失败，正是决定于什么阶级取得了和掌握了政权，什么政治力量组成了政权。一切反对党和人民政府的干部政策的人，反对用人应当重视政治情况的人，恰恰忘记了或者故意“忘记”了这一点。
    历史上的任何国家政权都是以一定的阶级、一定的政治力量为基础组成的。社会主义的国家同资本主义的国家在这个问题上如果有什么不同，那就是社会主义的国家公开地指明这一点，而资本主义的国家却往往竭力把自己伪装成为“全民”的国家。早在1848年，马克思和恩格斯就在共产党宣言中指出：“工人革命中的第一步是无产阶级变成为统治阶级，争得民主。”在1871年的巴黎公社的经验之后，马克思进一步指出，“工人阶级绝不能简单地握取现成的国家机器，并运用它来达到自己的目的。”这就是说，工人阶级必须用新的人、新的组织、新的方法来代替旧的国家机器。列宁在理论上和实践上大大地发展了马克思主义的国家理论，在他的领导下，世界上第一个工人阶级领导的国家建立起来了。中华人民共和国也就是这样的一个工人阶级领导的国家。还在中华人民共和国成立以前，毛泽东同志就在“论人民民主专政”一文中写道：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级
  （经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。”中华人民共和国宪法的第一条也明白地写着：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”在这里，没有也不能有丝毫含糊的地方。人民政府的人事工作，当然有责任按照工人阶级的政治标准来挑选干部，当然有责任使我们的国家机关的构成确实符合于宪法的规定，由工人阶级领导，以工农联盟为基础。
    列宁在“国家与革命”一文中曾经这样来描写无产阶级专政的实质：“马克思所运用到国家和社会主义革命问题上的阶级斗争学说，必然要归结于承认无产阶级的政治统治，无产阶级专政，即不与任何人分掌而直接凭借群众武装力量的政权。为要实现推倒资产阶级，就只有使无产阶级变为统治阶级，变为能够镇压资产阶级所必然进行的拚命反抗，并能够组织一切被剥削劳动群众来建设新经济制度的这样的统治阶级，才能够做到。”当然，这里所说的不与任何人分掌政权，并不是说无产阶级在国家政权中不与广大的非无产阶级群众联合，并不是说无产阶级不需要在经济文化工作中充分地使用一切在旧社会受教育的、但是愿意同劳动人民一道建设社会主义的专家和技术人员，而是说不与任何人分掌政权的领导。在我国，由于具体的历史条件，参加无产阶级领导的政权的，不仅有广大的农民和革命知识分子，而且有资产阶级分子和资产阶级的政治活动家。在这种情况下，人民政府挑选干部的任务就显得格外繁重而复杂。为了社会主义事业的利益，为了保证无产阶级对于整个国家政权的领导不受动摇，对于各种出身不同、经历不同的干部的政治历史、政治倾向和政治品质进行了解，根据干部的政治情况和业务能力作适当的安排，这种必要不是很清楚的吗？如果不是这样，如果照某些人所主张的那样，不要人事制度，糊里糊涂地使用干部，以致把重要的职责委托给一些政治面目不清的别有用心的人，那么，社会主义事业就会陷入危险的境地，人民民主的政权就会陷入危险的境地，这个道理不也是很清楚的吗？
    反对重视干部政治情况的人，常把所谓“德”说成一种抽象的东西，或者把它说得神秘莫测，或者把它说成是排斥异己的宗派主义的化身。这当然是一种歪曲。实际上，如前所说，在我们的国家机关（更不必说经济文化组织）中间，根据统一战线政策、对旧人员“包下来”的政策和对知识分子的团结教育改造政策，容纳了大量的在过去历史上同革命绝少姻缘甚至是站在敌对方面的人物，这是大家所知道的。但是工人阶级领导的社会主义的国家对于自己的工作人员，当然不能不提出一定的政治上的要求。过去的历史尽管千差万别，但是审查清楚是必要的；过去的政治主张尽管存而不论，但是在现在接受社会主义和人民民主制度是必要的。
    中华人民共和国宪法第十八条规定：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”这里规定的就是我们的国家要求于全体工作人员的起码的“德”。国家在选拔和考核工作人员的时候，固然必须严格遵守这个标准，而且在培养和教育工作人员的时候，也必须严格遵守这个标准。反对重视干部政治情况的人，也反对在学校中进行政治教育，反对在高等学校招生和选派留学生的时候注意政治条件。这本来没有什么可怪。可怪的是高等教育部的一些同志们在改进选派留学生办法的时候，似乎也认为“重政治、轻业务”的批评是正确的，似乎也认为选派留学生可以不问政治，“一视同仁”，（见5月29日本报第一版）。轻业务当然不对，但是重政治有什么不对呢？选派留学生，以至招收和培养高等学校的学生，分配高等学校的毕业生，同人民的事业都有重大的关系，怎么可以不重视政治呢？其实，世界上的任何一种政权在选用人才和培养人才方面都是有政治标准的，所不同的只是各有具体内容，有拥护劳动人民利益和反对劳动人民利益的区别罢了。真正不管干部的政治情况的国家，在世界上是没有的。那些向党和人民政府要求所谓任人唯才、要求用人不问政治情况的议论，如果不是由于反对社会主义事业和无产阶级专政，就是由于在政治上无知。
    右派分子恶毒地攻击党和人民政府的人事工作部门，把它说成是“宗派的窝子”，说成是“阎王殿”。他们如此仇恨人事工作部门，可见人事工作在阶级斗争中的地位是怎样重要了。诚然，人事工作部门的一部分工作人员还缺少足够的知识和经验，他们的工作的方法方式必须有许多重要的改进，他们在干部的选择和提升方面也犯了一些或大或小的错误，必须加以切实的纠正。但是，从总的方面说来，人事工作部门所执行的路线是符合于人民利益的，他们在建国八年来的繁重的工作是有巨大成就的，这是不能推翻的事实。党和人民政府提拔了大批的工人、农民、妇女、青年、“小知识分子”、“穿破鞋的”、种种在旧社会被侮辱和损害的优秀人物到我国的政治舞台上来，到各个战线的重要岗位上来，让他们成为我们国家的脊骨，这难道做错了吗？如果不是依靠他们的埋头苦干，依靠他们同广大人民群众的密切联系，难道我们的国家能够这样彻底地完成民主改革，实现国家统一和民族团结，并且这样顺利地进行社会主义革命吗？如果不是依靠他们同人民群众一道不屈不挠地努力，难道我们的国家能够这样有效地战胜各方面的严重困难，我们的建设事业能够这样地突飞猛进吗？旧时代官僚机关里尽管充满了“才俊之士”，却从来不能脱离假公济私、任用私人、贪污诈骗、压迫群众等等丑恶现象，这种现象在我们的国家机关中不是基本上消灭了吗？我们已经组成了新型的为劳动人民服务的国家机关，这个基本事实就证明了党和人民政府的干部政策是正确的，成功的。当然，应该指出，我国建设事业的一切成就，包含各方面的技术专家的劳动成果在内，包含从旧社会来而真正效忠于新社会的公务人员的劳动成果在内。但是他们都获得了为祖国服务的机会，这个事实不正是证明了我们的人事工作部门并没有排斥非劳动人民出身的工作人员，并没有实行“任人唯党”的宗派主义路线吗？
    在我们的人事工作中，宗派主义的倾向是有的，党的整风运动的任务之一，正是要同这种有害的、非工人阶级的、非社会主义的倾向作斗争。但是反对宗派主义，决不是说用人可以不问政治。恰恰相反，在反对宗派主义的同时，我们还必须同党内外的那种认为用人可以不问政治的倾向作斗争。只有这样，才能贯彻德才兼顾的原则，才能在人事工作问题上达到整风运动的目的。取消效忠于人民群众、效忠于人民民主、效忠于社会主义的政治标准，势必出现另一种只有利于少数人的政治标准。那不但是彻底的宗派主义的政治标准，而且根据历史的客观规律，那必然是一种反动的、反人民的、反社会主义的政治标准。
