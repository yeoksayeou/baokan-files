    Overcoming Drought to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    The Hubei Daily published an editorial on the 27th, entitled "Emergency Mobilization to Overcome Drought and Ensure an All-Round Bumper Harvest," regarding the drought that has occurred throughout the province.

    The editorial stated that striving for victory in the fight against drought is not only about ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, preventing losses to approximately six billion jin of grain and four million dan of cotton, and laying a material foundation for reliably guaranteeing and improving the people's livelihood; it is also of particularly great significance for achieving brilliant results in agricultural production in the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, exceeding the targets for agricultural development in the First Five-Year Plan, consolidating socialist agricultural production cooperatives, supporting disaster areas in other provinces, and supporting the country's socialist construction.

    We have accumulated years of experience in leading the masses in the fight against drought, the cooperative system has superior advantages, our province has many available water sources, and we have achieved much in water conservancy construction over the past eight years since liberation. These are all favorable conditions for fighting drought. The current issue is that farmers in drought-stricken areas must be urgently mobilized, under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, to ensure victory in the fight against drought. There should be no doubt about that.

    The editorial stated that over 90% of our province's agricultural cooperatives have achieved a bumper harvest of wheat this year, and early rice has also had a comprehensive bumper harvest. A bumper harvest of intermediate rice is in sight, and other crops are generally growing well. However, the grain we have actually received is only a small portion of the annual harvest. Under these circumstances, any passive, waiting-for-rain mentality, any paralysis, complacency, or pessimistic despair regarding the current fight against drought is unacceptable. At the same time, we must also overcome and prevent pessimistic sentiments of losing confidence in the fight against drought. Due to the persistence and development of the drought, especially in those areas where the drought is more severe, the fight against drought will be very arduous. But as long as we are good at relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, difficulties will be overcome, and the struggle will surely be victorious.

    The editorial pointed out that the masses are the source of wisdom and the source of strength. As long as we are good at relying on and mobilizing the masses, the power of the masses will be displayed endlessly. Of course, mobilizing the masses must be done by patiently conducting persuasion and education and mutual consultation. In the fight against drought, some people may have complacency and pessimism, and their mentality of waiting for rain may be even more serious. However, thanks to the leadership and education of the Party, the awareness of the masses is improving day by day, and drought resistance and increased production are also the people's own needs. As long as we patiently educate the masses, the broad masses will actively take action. Dabangdian Township in Yingshan County is actively fighting the drought under the education of the Party and the government. At present, the entire township has an average of more than 1,500 laborers engaged in drought relief every day, rescuing more than 2,700 mu of rice seedlings. In the fight against drought, we must also strictly prevent bad elements from using superstitious ideas to sabotage the fight against drought.

### 战胜旱灾确保丰收

    战胜旱灾确保丰收
    湖北日报27日就全省已发生的旱情，发表了“紧急动员起来战胜干旱确保全面丰收”的社论。
    社论说，全力争取抗旱斗争的胜利，不仅在于确保今年农业生产全面丰收，使约六十亿斤粮食和四百万担棉花不受灾害损失，为确实保证和必要的改善人民生活奠定了物质基础；而且对于在第一个五年计划的最后一年取得农业生产上的辉煌成就，超额完成第一个五年计划发展农业的任务；对于巩固社会主义制度的农业生产合作社；对于支援外省灾区，支援国家的社会主义建设，都具有特殊重大的意义。
    由于我们积累了多年的领导群众抗旱斗争的经验，由于合作社制度的优越作用，由于我省有着很多可供利用的水源，由于解放八年来水利建设的成就，这些都是抗旱的有利条件；目前的问题在于受旱地区农民紧急动员起来，在党和人民政府的领导和支持下，保证抗旱斗争胜利应该是无可怀疑的。
    社论说，今年我们的90％以上的农业社小麦获得了丰收，早稻也全面丰收了，中稻丰收在望，其他作物也一般生长良好。但是，我们真正收到手的粮食，还只占全年收获中的一小部分。在这种情况下，对于当前抗旱斗争任何消极等待的侥幸心理，任何麻痹自满或悲观失望的思想情绪，都是不应该的。同时，我们还必须克服和防止在抗旱斗争中丧失信心的悲观情绪。由于旱象的持续和发展，特别是在那些旱情比较严重的地区，抗旱斗争将会是非常艰巨的。但是只要我们善于依靠群众，发动群众，困难会被克服，斗争必定胜利。
    社论指出，群众是智慧的泉源，是力量的所在。只要我们善于依靠发动群众，群众的力量就会无穷尽的显示出来，当然发动群众必须是耐心地进行说服教育和互相商量。在抗旱斗争中，有些群众可能存在着麻痹思想和悲观情绪，他们中间侥幸等待天下雨的思想可能更严重。但由于在党的领导教育下，群众的觉悟一天天在提高，加之抗旱增产又是群众切身的要求，只要我们耐心的去教育群众，广大群众就会积极的行动起来。应山县大帮店乡就是在党和政府的教育下，积极进行抗旱斗争。目前，全乡投入抗旱的劳力平均每天达到一千五百多人，抢救稻苞二千七百多亩。抗旱斗争中还要严防坏分子利用迷信思想破坏抗旱斗争。
