Han Wangchen said: It wasn't most of us in the industrial and commercial sectors who were "shocked" to hear that the bourgeoisie still had a dual nature, but Zhang Naiqi himself.
I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Li, Bo, and Wu, as well as President Dong and Procurator-General Zhang and Vice Chairman Peng, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them.
What particularly excited me was that on the day before the preparatory meeting of this conference, Chairman Mao's speech at the 11th Enlarged Meeting of the Supreme State Conference was published. This speech gave us a powerful ideological weapon to distinguish between right and wrong, and between "fragrant flowers" and "poisonous weeds." With it, people became more clear-headed and saw things more clearly in the anti-rightist struggle.
The Party, in this rectification movement, called on non-Party members to offer their opinions to the Party. This sincere, humble, and realistic democratic style is unprecedented in the world. It is indeed an exciting thing. The Party is doing this precisely to eliminate "three isms" and correct shortcomings in its work, and to lead the people of the whole country to further improve the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. I fully believe that the Party is determined and will carry out the rectification well.
How hateful are the rightists, who took advantage of the rectification movement to spread their ideas. People like Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, and Ge Peiqi, under the guise of opposing dogmatism, used revisionism to attack Marxism-Leninism and peddled reactionary bourgeois political views. Some slandered the Party's leadership as a "Party world"; some clamored that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism"; some even arrogantly proposed "rotation of power among political parties"; and so on. These anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of theirs are not only intolerable to the working class and the broad masses of working people, but also absolutely unacceptable to the vast majority of us industrialists and businessmen. Who doesn't know that the lives of the people across the country are a hundred times happier than before liberation; China's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level; we non-Party members did not even have the freedom to be patriotic before liberation, and many were brutally murdered. What is the situation today? Many people have been elected as members of the CPPCC and people's representatives at all levels, and many have also participated in the leading work of government agencies at all levels. The Party and Chairman Mao have also put forward the policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." This precisely shows that there is true and broad democracy only in a socialist country. Without the leadership of the working class, without the Communist Party as the core of this leadership, could there be today? People say: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." This is absolutely true, this is the unanimous sentiment of the 600 million people of the whole country. Article 1 of the General Program of the Constitution clearly stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." The rightists' clamor for no Party leadership has not only been shattered in the face of objective reality, but is also a serious violation of the Constitution. In his "Government Work Report," Premier Zhou conducted a systematic and serious criticism of the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and actions of the bourgeois rightists. I have received a great education from this. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, who can say that achievements are not the main thing! Who can say that the rightists' conspiracies are not insidious! Through factual comparisons, we have a clearer understanding of the reactionary face of the rightists, and we have strengthened our courage and determination to struggle against the rightists.
My work is mainly in the industrial and commercial sectors, and Zhang Naiqi's repeated release of toxins to the industrial and commercial sectors is really intolerable. I want to expose his conspiracies and tricks.
What is Zhang Naiqi's intention in saying that the bourgeoisie has no dual nature? After the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry, the positive side of industrialists and businessmen has been constantly growing along with socialist transformation, which is a fact, but how can it be said that there is no dual nature? Taking our Shaanxi Province as an example, after the joint venture, some people's thoughts fluctuated, they were worried about gains and losses, and they were reluctant to take on more responsibilities; even a very small number of people envied the free market and demanded to withdraw from factories and stores; some were passive and slack at work for socialism during the day, and at night they were capitalists, undertaking private work everywhere; in Xi'an, Xianyang, Maweipo and other places, there were still a small number of private households engaged in black market speculation in medicinal materials, and the transaction prices were sometimes one to five times higher than the listed prices. Chen Yuhai, a transaction员 at the Maweipo Chinese medicinal materials market, had verifiable commission income of more than 6,500 yuan from June of last year to January 20 of this year alone. As for illegal acts such as adulteration, the sale of inferior goods as superior goods, and speculation, they have not been completely eliminated among private households. For example, since November of last year, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Medicinal Materials Management Office and relevant departments have discovered and dealt with more than 200 taels of fake musk; Dong Tingjian, a merchant in Xi'an, frequently engaged in reselling state-controlled materials to obtain exorbitant profits and lived extravagantly. Even more serious is that some leaders of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce once attempted to ask capable private personnel in joint venture enterprises to withdraw from the enterprises and engage in underground factories. May I ask, what is this if not negativity? What is this if not a dual nature? Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that China's national bourgeoisie has a dual nature. Zhang Naiqi could not get away with it, so he said: "Every class has a dual nature, and the working class also has it." What kind of talk is this! Let me ask: In the working class, who has proposed something like Li Kangnian's fixed interest rate for twenty years? Some industrialists and businessmen in our Xi'an, on the one hand, shouted that they wanted to give up fixed interest, and on the other hand, they were unwilling to use fixed interest income to purchase public bonds. The working class would never have this kind of situation. This is not only a deliberate slander of the working class, but also an attempt to put rouge on the bourgeoisie and incite the industrial and commercial sectors to oppose the leadership of the working class, resist transformation, and pull us back from the advanced socialist road to follow him down the capitalist dead end. It is really too hateful! Too rampant! I hereby warn Zhang Naiqi that your calculations are completely wrong. Under the education and help of the Party, after several years of study and practice, everyone's understanding has been improved. Except for individual stubborn elements, no one will be fooled by you. Zhang Naiqi once said: "When dogmatists still vaguely and without analysis, put forward that the national bourgeoisie still has a dual nature, industrialists and businessmen are shocked and cannot accept it, which is also not in line with the policy of mobilizing their enthusiasm." Let me tell you that the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen in our Shaanxi Province admit the dual nature. What is the result of admitting it? As of the end of March this year, according to incomplete statistics from 43 counties and cities including Xi'an and Baoji, 72.37 percent of private personnel have participated in socialist competitions, of which 7,621 have been rated as advanced producers or advanced workers and have received material rewards, accounting for 27.44 percent of the participants. These ironclad facts refute his heresies. The people who are shocked are definitely not our industrial and commercial sectors, but Zhang Naiqi, a double-dealer who "looks at the political situation and calculates economic gains"!
Zhang Naiqi insisted that "fixed interest is not exploitation" but a kind of "unearned income." I think this is his deliberate "mystification" there. This is a distortion of the Party and government's peaceful "redemption" policy, blurring the vision of the industrial and commercial sectors, and spreading capitalist toxins; otherwise, when the socialist transformation of our industrialists and businessmen is in the stage of "the melon is about to ripen and the canal is about to be completed," why is Zhang Naiqi in such a hurry to "pick unripe melons and destroy canals that are about to be completed"? I ask Zhang Naiqi one sentence, you say that you support socialism, but where can one smell the slightest socialist flavor in your slander that drags the industrial and commercial sectors back? Isn't this "selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head"?
Zhang Naiqi said, "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." This is even more nonsense. Capitalism is a social system, and bureaucracy is only a style of work, and it is a product of class social systems. They are two things of completely different nature. Things of different nature cannot be compared. His comparison seems to imply that there is no bureaucracy in capitalist society. History tells us that bureaucracy is precisely inherited from class society. The Communist Party proposes bureaucracy to eliminate it, not to preserve it. How can a bad style of work be said to be "more dangerous" than capitalism? His statement is the most blatant manifestation of anti-socialism! We must not be careless. It should be pointed out that only the working class party—the Chinese Communist Party—dares to and is able to overthrow bureaucracy. Capitalism cannot compare with this. No matter how eloquent the rightists are, it is all in vain.
In short, the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists are by no means accidental. Zhang Naiqi has consistently peddled capitalist toxins, hoping for a capitalist restoration. Moreover, he is the organizer and planner of this restoration. I once again warn these rightists that you should deeply appreciate Premier Zhou's earnest and sincere advice, repent sincerely, and immediately confess your serious mistakes and reactionary behavior to the people. The door to socialist transformation is open to you; if you dare to persist in your reactionary stance and resist transformation, you will be cutting yourself off from the people, and the people will not forgive you.
This anti-rightist struggle has been a great education for me, making me more aware that when we correctly handle contradictions among the people, we must not ignore the existence of classes and class struggle, nor can we ignore the existence of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Our industrialists and businessmen must further raise our vigilance, distinguish between right and wrong, stand firm on the socialist position, resolutely follow the Communist Party, resolutely draw a clear line with the rightists and fight to the end; and under the correct leadership and help of the Party, continue to strengthen self-transformation in learning and work practice, and strive to serve the people; at the same time, our industrialists and businessmen must take enterprises as the base of transformation, implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises, vigorously increase production and practice economy, launch socialist competitions, on the one hand, transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers; on the other hand, accumulate funds for socialism; and strive to eliminate all poverty, ignorance, and disasters of mankind, and move from socialism to communism!

    章乃器是妄图复辟资本主义的组织者和策划者
    韩望尘说：听到说资产阶级还有两面性的时候“惊心动魄”的不是我们大部分工商界人士，而是章乃器自己。
    我完全同意周总理和李、薄、乌三位副总理以及董院长、张检察长和彭副委员长的报告，并保证坚决贯彻执行。
    首先使我特别兴奋的是，当这次大会的预备会的先一天，毛主席在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上的讲话发表了。这个讲话给了我们一个明辨是非、区别“香花”和“毒草”的强大的思想武器。人们在反右派斗争中，有了它，头脑更加清醒，眼睛擦得越亮了。
    党在这次整风运动中，号召党外人士向党提意见，这种诚恳虚心和实事求是的民主作风，在世界上是史无前例的。确是一件令人兴奋的事。党这样做，正是为了清除“三个主义”和纠正工作中的缺点，领导全国人民进一步做好国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。我完全相信，党一定有决心，会把风整得很好。
    可恨右派分子，竟钻整风的空子，像章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、葛佩琦等人，他们趁鸣放的机会，在反对教条主义的幌子下，以修正主义攻击马列主义，贩运资产阶级反动的政治观点。有的污蔑党的领导是“党天下”；有的叫嚣“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”；有的甚至狂妄地提出“各党派轮流执政”；等等。他们这种反党、反社会主义的谬论，不但工人阶级和广大的劳动人民不容许，就是我们绝大多数工商业者，也绝对不能答应的。谁不知道，全国人民的生活，比解放前幸福百倍；我国的国际地位空前提高；我们党外人士，解放前连爱国的自由都没有，不知有多少人被惨杀。今天是什么情况？许多人士被选为各级政协委员和人民代表，还有不少的人，参加了各级政府机关的领导工作。党和毛主席又提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“长期共存、互相监督”的方针。这正说明了只有在社会主义的国家里，才有真正的广泛的民主。如果没有工人阶级的领导，如果没有共产党做这个领导的核心，还能有今天吗？人们说：“没有共产党就没有新中国。”这是千真万确的，这是全国六亿人民一致的心意。宪法总纲第一条明确规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”右派分子叫嚣不要党的领导，不但在客观实际面前，已经碰得头破血流，而且也是严重违反宪法的行为。周总理在“政府工作报告”中，对于资产阶级右派分子反党、反社会主义的言论和行动，进行了有系统的严正的批判。使我受到很大的教育。听了总理的报告，谁说成绩不是主要的！谁说右派分子的阴谋不是毒辣的！通过事实对比，使我们更加清楚地认识了右派分子的反动面目，增强了我们对右派分子进行斗争的勇气和决心。
    我的工作，主要在工商界方面，而章乃器一再对工商界施放毒素，实在不能容忍，我要揭发他的阴谋诡计。
    章乃器说资产阶级没有两面性。究竟居心何在？全行业公私合营后，工商业者随着社会主义改造，积极的一面不断增长，这是事实，但怎么能说没有两面性呢？就以我们陕西省来说，合营后，有的人思想动荡，患得患失，遇事缩手缩脚，不愿多负责任；甚至还有极少数人，羡慕自由市场，要求退出厂店；有的白天对社会主义消极怠工，晚上又是资本主义，到处承揽私活；西安、咸阳、马嵬坡等地还有少数私营户进行药材黑市投机活动，成交价格有的高出牌价一至五倍。马嵬坡中药材市场交易员陈玉海从去年六月至今年一月二十日仅手续费收入有据可查的就是六千五百多元。至于掺杂掺假、以劣充优、投机倒把的违法行为，在私营户中，也并没有完全消灭。如省供销社药材经营管理处和有关部门自去年十一月以来已经发现和处理的假麝香就有二百多两；西安市商贩董廷建经常从事捣贩国家统购物资，获取暴利，生活奢华。更严重的是，西安市工商联领导人中，曾有人企图叫合营企业里有能力的私方人员，退出企业搞地下工厂。试问这不是消极性是什么？不是两面性是什么？毛主席明确指出：我国民族资产阶级有两面性。章乃器混不过去了又说：“那个阶级都有两面性，工人阶级也有。”这是什么话！我来问：在工人阶级中，有谁提出就像李康年定息二十年一类的话呢？我们西安市有的工商业者，一面高喊要放弃定息，一面又不愿以定息收入购买公债。这种情况，工人阶级根本就不会有的，这不但是对工人阶级有意的污蔑，是对资产阶级擦胭抹粉，而且企图以此煽动工商界，反对工人阶级领导，抗拒改造，把我们从先进社会主义的道路上拉回去跟他走向资本主义的死路。实在是太可恶了！太猖狂了！我在这里正告章乃器，你的算盘完全打错了，工商业者在党的教育帮助下，经过几年的学习和实践，大家的认识都提高了，除了个别的顽固分子外，是不会上你的当的。章乃器曾说过：“当教条主义者仍然笼统地不加分析，提出民族资产阶级还有两面性的时候，工商业家是惊心动魄的，是不能接受的，这和调动他们的积极性的方针也是不符合的。”让我告诉大家，我们陕西省绝大多数的工商业者，都是承认两面性的。承认的结果又如何呢？截至今年三月底，据西安、宝鸡等四十三县市的私方人员不完全的统计，已有百分之七十二点三七参加了社会主义竞赛，其中有七千六百二十一人被评为先进生产者或先进工作者和获得物质奖励，占参加人数百分之二十七点四四。这些铁的事实驳斥了他的邪说，惊心动魄的人，决不是我们工商界，而是“看看政治行情，打打经济算盘”的两面派分子章乃器！
    章乃器硬说“定息不是剥削”，是一种“不劳而获的收入”。我认为这是他别有用心的在那里“故弄玄虚”。这是对党和政府的和平“赎买”政策的歪曲，模糊工商界的视听，散布资本主义毒素；要不然的话，我们工商业者的社会主义改造，正处在“瓜将熟、渠将成”的时候，章乃器何苦赶忙来“摘未熟之瓜，毁将成之渠”呢？我问章乃器一句，你口口声声说拥护社会主义，但你这种拖工商界后腿的谰调，那里能嗅出丝毫的社会主义气味？！这不是“挂羊头卖狗肉”是什么？
    章乃器说，“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”。更是胡说八道。资本主义是一种社会制度，官僚主义只是一种工作作风，而且是阶级社会制度下的产物。是性质完全不同的两种东西。不同性质的东西，是不能对比的。经他这样一比，就好像意味着资本主义社会没有官僚主义。历史告诉我们，官僚主义正是从阶级社会里遗留下来的，共产党提出官僚主义，是要清除它，而不是保存它。一种不好的工作作风，怎能说它比资本主义“更危险”呢？他这种说法，是反社会主义最露骨的表现！我们千万不能麻痹大意。应该指出，只有工人阶级的政党——中国共产党，才敢于而且也能够反掉官僚主义，这是资本主义无法比拟的。不管右派分子怎样花言巧语，都是枉费心机。
    总而言之，右派分子的反动言行，决不是偶然的。章乃器是一贯地贩运资本主义毒素，希望资本主义复辟的。而且，是这个复辟的组织者和策划者。我再警告这些右派分子，你们应该深切体会周总理语重心长的恳切劝告，憣然悔悟，立即向人民交代自己的严重错误和反动行为，社会主义改造的大门是对你们开着的；如果你们胆敢坚持反动立场，抗拒改造，那就是自绝于人民，人民不会宽恕你们。
    通过这次反右派的斗争，对我是一个很大的教育，使我更加明白了当我们正确处理人民内部矛盾的时候，绝不能无视还有阶级和阶级斗争的存在，也不能无视还有敌我矛盾的存在。我们工商业者一定要更进一步地提高警惕，明辨是非，站稳社会主义立场，坚决跟着共产党走，坚决与右派分子划清界限斗争到底；并在党的正确领导帮助下，继续在学习、工作实践中，加强自我改造，努力为人民服务；同时我们工商业者要以企业为改造基地，贯彻勤俭办企业的精神，厉行增产节约，展开社会主义竞赛，一方面把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者；一方面为社会主义积累资金；为消灭人类一切贫困、愚昧、灾难，从社会主义走向共产主义而奋斗！
