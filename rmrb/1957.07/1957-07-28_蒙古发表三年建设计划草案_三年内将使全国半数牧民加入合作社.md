The draft plan will be submitted to the 13th National Congress of the Party for discussion and adoption after being discussed by the people of the whole country.

    The draft points out that developing agriculture and animal husbandry is one of the main tasks of the three-year plan. By 1960, the total number of livestock in the country will increase by 5.6% compared to 1957; the area of agricultural sowing will increase by 2.3 times compared to the present, reaching more than 224,000 hectares; and within three years, the breeds of three million sheep and 70,000 cattle will be improved using fine breeds of livestock from the Soviet Union.

    The draft stipulates that 50% of individual herdsmen should join production cooperatives within three years, and they should be gradually helped to settle down. The draft also stipulates the tasks of developing veterinary stations and developing water conservancy.

    According to the draft, by 1960, the total industrial output value of the country will increase by 39% compared to 1957. The proportion of state-owned industry in all industries will increase from 83% in 1957 to 85%.

    By 1960, the oil factory in Mongolia's East Gobi Province will supply half of the country's annual oil consumption.

    The draft stipulates that within three years, some industrial enterprises will be expanded with the assistance of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and Czechoslovakia. Light industry, transportation, and postal and telecommunications industries will continue to develop. Each province and the capital will have civil aviation planes to travel to and from. A radio station will be built in Ulaanbaatar.

    The draft points out that by 1960, the retail sales of goods will increase by 29% compared to 1957, reaching 800 million tugriks. Foreign trade will also be further developed, and the export volume in 1960 will increase by 19% compared to 1957.

    The draft stipulates that the central task of people's education in these three years is to ensure that school-age children in rural areas universally receive primary education; children in towns receive seven years of education. By 1960, the number of primary and secondary school students will increase to more than 100,000.

    In these three years, the number of employees nationwide will increase by 13%. From 1958, the income tax of employees will be reduced by 30%, and the income of employees will therefore increase by 15 million to 20 million tugriks.

    The total investment in the three-year construction plan is 700 million tugriks, an increase of 19% compared to the total investment in the Second Five-Year Plan.
