Hechuan County Yunmen Township Farmers Expose
Zhang Naiqi's Protection of Landlords During Land Reform
(Our Chengdu dispatch, July 17th) Some agricultural cooperative members in Yunmen Township, Hechuan County, Sichuan, held a meeting on the 11th to expose Zhang Naiqi's reactionary stance during land reform in the township in 1951. Tang Shizhong and others revealed Zhang's conspiracy to support the landlords behind the scenes. When Zhang held meetings with the landlords, he often sent peasant militia members to stand guard far away and secretly talked with the landlords. The landlords also often secretly went to Zhang for confidential talks, which made them even more arrogant. Tang Shizhong said that once when he went to pursue the property that the landlord Huang Xuran should hand over, Huang said, "Commander Zhang (Zhang was the head of the land reform visiting delegation) said that if you have it, hand it over, if you don't have it, forget about it. You don't dare to do anything. Commander Zhang is working for us." The landlord Wang Zhongwen also said to me: "Commander Zhang said that the fruits you have received are not yet secure." At that time, my awareness was not high, and I thought that Zhang was from the central government and said it was not secure, so I returned the millstone and waterwheel I had received to Wang Zhongping.

Tan Shaocheng said that during the land reform, the landlord's son, Wang Zuozhou, saw me carrying a gun and said, "You are so vicious to the landlords, Commander Zhang said it does not conform to the policy, you probably won't be able to carry your guns securely, maybe they will be turned around one day."

Zhang everywhere protected the landlords during land reform. Chen Bojun said, fighting the landlords was like digging out a piece of Zhang's heart, he always used the policy to scare us and suppress the farmers' fighting spirit. At that time, the farmers secretly scolded him as the landlord's boss behind the scenes.

Zhang even more protected landlords who were also industrialists and businessmen. Zhao Chonggui said that the landlord Zheng Chongwen was very cunning. When we pointed our fingers at him and argued with him, Zhang scolded me and said that I was violating the policy. Seeing that Zhang was protecting the landlords everywhere, many farmers said that with Zhang Naiqi, the landlord class could not be defeated.

    合川县云门乡农民揭露
    章乃器土改时袒护地主
    本报成都17日电  四川合川县云门乡部分农业社员于11日集会揭发1951年在该乡参加土地改革的章乃器的反动立场。汤士忠等揭发章暗地给地主撑腰的阴谋活动。章在开地主会时常把农民武装队员派到远处站岗，偷偷地和地主谈话。地主们也常悄悄去找章密谈，因而使得地主们更加嚣张。汤士忠说有次我去追地主黄绪然应交出的财产，他说“章团长（章是土改参观团团长）说过有就交没有就算了，你们不敢怎样，章团长是给我们办事的”。地主王仲文还对我说：“章团长说你们分到的果实还不稳当”。我那时觉悟不高，以为章是中央来的还说不稳当，就把分到手的磨子水车送还了王仲平。
    谭绍成说，土改时地主的儿子王作舟见我背着枪，就说“你们对地主这么毒辣，章团长说不符合政策，你们枪杆恐怕背不稳当，说不定二天要掉过来。”
    章在土改中处处袒护地主。陈伯均说，我们斗地主就像挖了章的心头肉一样，他处处拿政策吓唬我们，打击农民斗争情绪。当时农民都背地骂他是地主后台老板。
    章对工商业兼地主更加袒护。赵崇贵说，地主郑崇文很狡猾，我们用手指着同他斗争说理，章就训我一顿，说我违反政策。农民们见章对地主处处包庇，很多农民说，有了章乃器地主阶级打不垮。
