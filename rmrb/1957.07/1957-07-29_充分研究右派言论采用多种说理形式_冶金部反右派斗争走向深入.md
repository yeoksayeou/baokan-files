    Fully Research Rightist Statements, Adopt Various Forms of Reasoning
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's Anti-Rightist Struggle Moves Towards Depth
    (Our dispatch) The anti-Rightist struggle in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has begun to move in depth. Because this ministry has fully analyzed and studied the statements of the Rightists in the anti-Rightist struggle, and has adopted various forms of reasoning struggle, the class consciousness and fighting enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff have rapidly increased. A team of activists has been formed and gained experience and training in the struggle; middle-of-the-roaders have turned to the Party one after another; those who were once confused by the Rightists' statements have also begun to shake off the influence of the Rightists and firmly expressed their determination to draw a clear line with the Rightists. The Rightists have been isolated.
    When the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was conducting a reasoning struggle with the Rightist Yan Shaoxi, the ministry's material research group specifically collected and sorted out Yan Shaoxi's published statements, and found that the Rightist Yan Shaoxi's anti-Party and anti-socialist statements were mainly concentrated in the following aspects: 1. Negating construction achievements; 2. Abolishing the leadership of the Party; 3. Demanding that veteran cadres step down; 4. Vilifying Party members and inciting discord between the Party and the masses; 5. Completely negating the achievements of learning from the Soviet Union, and negating the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements. The material research group then divided into five groups according to these arguments to conduct special criticism and wrote outlines for speeches, which were handed over to the study groups of sections and divisions for discussion and supplementation. This not only made the reasoning struggle more systematic and profound, and effectively refuted the Rightists, but also through this series of preparatory work, raised the political understanding of the workers and staff. A few people who were temporarily confused by the Rightists' statements nodded in agreement after hearing the well-reasoned refutations of the masses and asked to speak at the meeting.
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also adopted various forms of reasoning struggle against the Rightists. There were debates, criticism meetings, confrontation meetings, ideological meetings, individual talks, and big-character posters. Experience has proved that adopting a variety of forms of struggle is beneficial to adhering to reasoning struggle. In the early stage of the anti-Rightist struggle, small-scale debates played a very important role. After the struggle entered a climax, they adopted the form of criticism meetings or confrontation meetings, on the one hand, exposing their ugly behaviors, and on the other hand, conducting systematic and thorough criticism of reactionary fallacies. At present, the big-character poster has become an important tool in the anti-Rightist struggle in this ministry. Whether in terms of the number of big-character posters or the number of signatures, its momentum far exceeds the period when the Rightists attacked the Party. The Rightists of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute were the most rampant. During the period of full airing of views, a total of 300 big-character posters were posted in the whole institute. Now, in just a few days, more than 500 have been posted. The various departments of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry posted 100 big-character posters during the period of full airing of views, and more than 400 have been posted in this counterattack against the Rightists, which is truly an unprecedented event.
    At present, 12,000 cadres in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have participated in this anti-Rightist struggle. In order to thoroughly refute the Rightists' statements, they are summing up the work of the previous stage, drawing on past experiences, and further advancing the anti-Rightist struggle in depth.

    充分研究右派言论采用多种说理形式
    冶金部反右派斗争走向深入
    本报讯　冶金工业部的反右派斗争已经开始走向深入。这个部由于在反右派斗争中对于右派分子的言论做了充分的分析研究，同时又采取了多种形式的说理斗争的方式，广大职工的阶级觉悟和斗争热情迅速提高。积极分子的队伍已经形成，并在斗争中获得了经验和锻炼；中间分子纷纷向党靠拢；曾经为右派分子的言论所迷惑的人员，也开始摆脱右派分子的影响，坚决表示和右派划清界限。右派分子已经孤立了。
    冶金部设计局在和右派分子阎绍玺进行说理斗争的时候，这个部的材料研究小组，专门对阎绍玺发表过的言论，进行搜集整理，发现右派分子阎绍玺反党反社会主义的言论主要集中在以下几个方面：一、否定建设成绩；二、取消党的领导；三、要老干部下台；四、丑化党员，挑拨党群关系；五、全盘否定学习苏联的成就，否定肃反、三反、五反的成就。材料研究组即根据这些论点，分成五个小组进行专题批判，写成发言提纲，交给科、处整风学习小组去讨论补充。这样做，不仅使说理斗争更加系统深刻，有力地驳斥右派分子，而且通过这一系列的准备工作，把职工群众的政治认识提高一步。少数一时为右派言论所迷惑的人，听到群众的批驳有理有据，也点头称是，要求在大会发言。
    冶金工业部对右派说理斗争的形式也是多种多样的。有辩论会、批判会、对证会、思想见面、个别谈话及大字报等形式。经验证明，采取多种多样的斗争形式，对坚持说理斗争来说是有好处的。在反右派斗争初期，小型辩论会很起作用，斗争进入高潮以后，他们又采用批判会或是对证会的形式，一面揭露其丑恶行为，另一面对反动谬论进行系统彻底的批判。目前，这个部的大字报已成为反右派斗争的重要工具了。无论就大字报的张数和签名的人数来说，其声势远远超过了右派分子向党进攻的时期。黑色冶金设计院右派分子最猖狂，大放时期，全院共贴出大字报三百张。现在，几天中，就贴出了五百多张。冶金部各司，大鸣大放时，贴出了一百张，这次反击右派已贴出了四百多张，真是盛况空前。
    目前冶金工业部已有一万二千名干部参加了这次反右派斗争。为了彻底驳斥右派分子的言论，他们在总结上一阶段工作的基础上，吸取过去的经验，把反右派斗争进一步向深入方面推进。
