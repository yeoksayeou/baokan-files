In the First Year of the Second Five-Year Plan
    India's Industrial and Agricultural Production Has Made Considerable Progress

    (Reported by Indian News Service) During the first year of India's Second Five-Year Plan (April 1956 to April 1957), significant achievements were made in industrial and agricultural production.

    In agriculture, the original estimate was an increase in grain production of about 2.5 million tons, but the actual increase is estimated to be about 1.4 million tons. During 1956-1957, cotton production reached 4.8 million bales, an increase of about 800,000 bales compared to 1955-1956. Jute production also increased to over 4.2 million bales.

    In terms of irrigation and electricity, approximately 90 large and medium-sized projects were completed during 1956-1957. Additionally, about 1.5 million acres of land were irrigated through large and medium-sized irrigation projects, and another 1.6 million acres were irrigated through small-scale irrigation projects. During this year, India's electricity supply increased by approximately 260,000 kilowatts. Two thousand cities and villages received new electricity supplies.

    In industry, the production of radio receivers increased by 86%, while the production of bicycles, automobiles, electric motors, and transformers increased by 33% to 60%. Other industries, such as cement, sugar, and diesel engine industries, saw production increases of 10% to 25%. Coal production was originally estimated to increase by 2 million tons, but the actual increase was only 1.2 million tons. Steel production increased by about 4%.

    Rural and small-scale industries also made considerable progress in production. For example, the production of handloom cloth increased by 68 million yards.

    In transportation, approximately 87 miles of new railway lines have been opened to traffic.

    However, the first year of India's Second Five-Year Plan also faced considerable difficulties, primarily a lack of funds and foreign exchange, and a shortage of essential construction materials such as iron and cement.

    According to the Indian News Service, the reduced expenditure for the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan amounted to 7.61 billion rupees, but the total domestic budgetary resources were approximately 4.27 billion rupees. Even with foreign aid, the financial shortfall still reached 2.7 billion rupees.

    在第二个五年计划的头一年
    印度工农业生产有相当进展
    本报讯　据印度新闻处消息：印度在第二个五年计划的第一年（1956年4月到1957年4月）期间，工农业生产得到了相当大的成就。
    在农业方面，原来预计可以增产粮食约二百五十万吨，据估计实际增加了约一百四十万吨。1956年到1957年期间，棉花的收成是四百八十万包，比1955到1956年期间约增加了八十万包。黄麻的产量也增加到四百二十多万包。
    在灌溉和电力方面，在1956年到1957年期间，大约有九十个大、中工程可以完工。另外大约有一百五十万英亩的土地通过大、中型的灌溉工程得到灌溉，还有一百六十万英亩的土地通过小型灌溉工程得到灌溉。在这一年期间，印度的电力供应大约增加了二十六万瓩。有二千个城市和乡村得到新的电力供应。
    在工业方面，无线电收音机的生产提高了86％，自行车、汽车、电马达和变压器的生产增加了33％到60％不等。其它工业，如水泥工业、制糖工业和柴油机工业的产量增加了10％到25％不等。煤的生产原来估计要增加二百万吨，而实际只增加了一百二十万吨，制成钢的生产增加了约4％。
    乡村的和小规模的工业，生产也有了相当的进展。如用手织机织出来的布增加了六千八百万码。
    在交通方面，约有八十七英里的新铁路线已开始通车。
    但是，在印度第二个五年计划的第一年中，也存在着相当的困难，主要是缺乏资金和外汇，缺乏铁、水泥等重要建设物资。
    据印度新闻处说，第二个五年计划第一年经过削减的经费数目为七十六亿一千万卢比，但国内预算上的财源总数约四十二亿七千万卢比，加上外援，财源差额仍达二十七亿卢比。
