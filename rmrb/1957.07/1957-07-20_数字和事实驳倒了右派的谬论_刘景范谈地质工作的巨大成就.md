I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng.

The anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist criminal activities of the rightists are manifested in all aspects. In geological work, they say that the Communist Party cannot lead geological work, that geological work has no achievements, and that 1956 was a complete mess with no accomplishments whatsoever. I am engaged in geological work, and I would like to express some opinions on whether or not there have been achievements in geological work.

The geological work in 1956 was carried out in the context of the upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction. All staff and scientific and technical personnel responded to the call of the Central Committee and engaged in intense and arduous labor, greatly advancing geological work and making it entirely possible for us to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan for geological work ahead of schedule.

Last year's geological exploration work greatly exceeded the total of the previous three years.

In 1956, the geological exploration work of the Ministry of Geology, in terms of the scale and speed of development, greatly exceeded the first three years of the Five-Year Plan. The amount of exploration work and the reserves of many minerals exceeded the total of the previous three years, and the mineral reserve tasks in the Five-Year Plan were basically completed within four years. Geological surveying and scientific research work have been greatly developed and strengthened. I will now use some figures and facts to illustrate this:

In 1956, the Ministry of Geology organized 126 exploration teams to explore 25 kinds of minerals. The amount of drilling work, which is the main means of exploring mineral deposits, was 1.26 million meters, which is 137 percent of the total amount of drilling work in the previous three years. The cumulative total for four years was 2.18 million meters, which is 86 percent of the Five-Year Plan. It is expected that the targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan will be greatly exceeded in 1957. In addition, 260,000 meters of work such as vertical shafts, inclined shafts, horizontal tunnels, and shallow wells, and 1.98 million cubic meters of trench exploration were completed.

As a result of completing these work volumes in 1956, the growth rate of various mineral reserves has been greatly increased. In terms of the 25 kinds of minerals explored in 1956, the reserves of 15 of them, compared with the previous three years, have exceeded the cumulative total of the previous three years for nine kinds. That is, manganese exceeded by 3 percent, lead and zinc exceeded by 70 percent, aluminum exceeded by 192 percent, vanadium exceeded by 501 percent, chromium exceeded by 900 percent, and diamonds exceeded by 41 percent. Phosphorus exceeded by 153 percent, piezoelectric quartz (single crystal block) exceeded by 149 percent, and refractory clay exceeded by 75 percent. Four kinds are equivalent to more than 30 percent of the cumulative reserves of the previous three years. That is, iron is equivalent to 43 percent, titanium is equivalent to 46 percent, pyrite is equivalent to 33 percent, and coal is equivalent to 92 percent. Only the reserves of copper and tin are less than 30 percent. Other ten kinds of minerals that were not explored in the previous three years, such as molybdenum, nickel, mercury, asbestos, mica, alum, magnesite, and molding sand, also had considerable reserves explored in 1956.

The rapid growth of mineral reserves is sufficient to guarantee the needs of industrialization.

Due to the rapid growth of these mineral reserves in 1956, we basically completed the Five-Year Plan within four years. The completion status of the twelve mineral reserves undertaken by the Ministry of Geology in the Five-Year Plan, excluding tungsten ore reserves which have been transferred to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for exploration, is as follows for the remaining eleven: iron completed 129 percent, manganese completed 158 percent, chromium completed 26 percent, copper completed 106 percent, lead and zinc completed 148 percent, aluminum completed 209 percent, tin completed 98 percent, molybdenum completed 964 percent, coal completed 121 percent, phosphorus completed 324 percent, and pyrite completed 258 percent. At the same time, more than 20 kinds of mineral reserves not stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, such as titanium, vanadium, nickel, mercury, magnesite, diamonds, asbestos, mica, piezoelectric quartz, alum, auxiliary raw materials for ferrous metallurgy, and oil shale, have also been explored. These achievements are only a part of China's geological work. The Ministries of Metallurgy, Coal, Chemical Industry, Petroleum, and Building Materials have also carried out a lot of surveying and exploration work. Adding together the reserves obtained nationwide, the needs of large-scale enterprises in ferrous metallurgy, non-ferrous metallurgy, fuel, and some non-metals (such as phosphorus and sulfur) in the first and second Five-Year Plans are basically guaranteed. Taking coal and iron as examples, from 1953 to 1956, the national proven coal reserves were 20.1 billion tons, which can meet the needs of more than 170 pairs of newly built, expanded, and restored mine shafts with a total design capacity of nearly 100 million tons, solving the coking coal base for steel plants in Baotou, Wuhan, Anshan, Taiyuan, Shijingshan, Chongqing, and Ma'anshan, and also basically guaranteeing the coal consumption of national industry and transportation. After surveying and prediction, it is estimated that the total coal reserves in the country may be more than 1.2 trillion tons. Before liberation, the total iron ore reserves in the country were estimated to be 3 billion tons. After several years of work, based on the prediction of dozens of known major mining areas, it is estimated that the total reserves are more than 11 billion tons. By 1956, the national proven reserves were 3.6 billion tons. The resources of the three steel plants in Anshan, Benxi, and Baotou have been fully guaranteed and there are sufficient reserves. Wuhan, Northwest, Southwest, Taiyuan, and Shijingshan have been able to guarantee the first phase of construction or expansion. The resources required by small and medium-sized steel plants such as Longyan, Yangquan, D渡口 (D渡口), Fujian, Guangdong, and Xinjiang have also been basically guaranteed. The iron ore in Hainan Island, Shandong, and Wutai Mountain in Shanxi can also be used flexibly. In short, after several years of work, it has been further proved that China has abundant mineral resources. It is not only a country rich in tungsten, tin, antimony, coal, iron, copper, lead, and zinc, but also a country rich in molybdenum ore, which has recently been confirmed. These mineral resources are sufficient to guarantee the needs of China's socialist industrialization.

Don't the rightist gentlemen even have this common sense?

China's large-scale geological exploration work started in 1952. In just four years, by 1956, so many mineral resources were explored. This is a huge achievement unprecedented in Chinese history. Although China's geological work has a history of more than 30 years, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, they did not need geological personnel to engage in mineral exploration, allowing China's rich mineral resources to be plundered and destroyed by imperialism, or to be buried underground forever, unable to create happiness for the people. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, a large number of mineral resources have been explored in China and have been used for industrial construction, which has been closely related to the material life of the broad masses of the people. This is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party and the concrete manifestation of the superiority of socialism. These facts are recognized by the people of the whole country. Do the rightist gentlemen, who call themselves "big intellectuals," not even have this common sense? Obviously, this is not the case, but they are hostile to these achievements. Therefore, they deliberately obliterate the achievements, exaggerate the shortcomings, reverse right and wrong, and create chaos in order to carry out their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities.

Of course, we are not satisfied with these achievements. We ourselves know that there are still some shortcomings and errors in our work. For example, there are still many things we have not done well enough, and the types of minerals that have been explored in the past cannot fully meet the needs of the country. The degree of guarantee for some minerals needed by the country is still very poor. Although some deposits of chromium, nickel, mica, asbestos, and piezoelectric quartz have been found and some reserves have been explored, the reserves are still very small. Although the reserves of some minerals are quite large, the grade is not high enough, which also affects the scale of construction. For example, rich open-hearth furnace iron ore is still extremely insufficient. Although the reserves of some large copper and lead-zinc mines are large, the scale of construction is limited due to the slightly lower grade and the small mining area. The distribution of some minerals is unbalanced. Manganese and phosphorus reserves are mostly concentrated in the south, coal is mostly concentrated in the north, and the production areas of sulfur and phosphorus are not well matched. In the past, we paid attention to meeting the needs of building large-scale enterprises and focused on finding and exploring some large deposits to ensure the resources of the national backbone enterprises. This is of course necessary, but we have not paid enough attention to the resources needed for building small and medium-sized enterprises and local enterprises, and we cannot meet them at present. We have done even less work on rare metals and dispersed elements.

The physical workload in the Ministry of Geology's annual plan for 1956 was not fully completed. The mineral reserves of sixteen kinds were completed and overfulfilled, while seven kinds were poorly completed. The main reason for not fully completing the plan was that the plan was set too high. Insufficient technical strength and untimely supply of equipment. Some deposits have become smaller and poorer during exploration. In addition, the changes in the organization during a certain period have affected production to some extent. The excessively high labor plan and the lax control in implementation have led to the recruitment and reception of a batch of students and employees, which has also increased some difficulties in the work. Some of the reasons for these shortcomings are due to the limitations of geological conditions, which cannot be overcome by manpower; some are due to lack of experience; and some are due to bureaucracy and subjectivism in our work. Some of these shortcomings have been corrected in our work in 1957, and some are being continuously checked and corrected in the rectification movement.

The backward situation of surveying work has been improved.

Some people say that since liberation, we have only engaged in reserve exploration and not in surveying and scientific research, which is a mistake in policy. This statement is incorrect. During the period when China began construction, the demand for mineral resources in the heavy industry sector was very urgent, and old China did not leave us any proven mineral resources. In order to solve the resource problem, we adopted the policy of concentrating manpower and material resources on key exploration to solve this urgent problem. This policy is correct. According to this policy, we actively worked hard, and when the several major mineral resources were basically guaranteed, we gradually strengthened geological surveying and scientific research work. Taking 1956 as an example, we organized 128 surveying teams, including 19 large surveying and inspection teams with Soviet technical assistance. As a result of the surveying and inspection of hundreds of ore deposits, more than 40 mineral producing areas have industrial value. Among them, the larger ones are copper mines in Jiangxi, copper and copper-nickel mines in Gansu, molybdenum mines in Shaanxi, rich iron ore in Guangdong and Fujian, iron ore in western Hubei, lead-zinc mines in Guizhou, phosphorus mines in Hubei and Hunan, and piezoelectric quartz and lead-zinc mines in Qinghai. The backward situation of surveying work has been improved. We organized 12 petroleum surveying teams and conducted surveying and mapping work in Xinjiang, Qaidam, the North China Plain, the Songliao Plain, the Sichuan Basin, the Ordos Platform, Guizhou, Guangxi and other regions for more than 400,000 square kilometers. We also discovered a batch of structures that may contain oil, which improved the situation where petroleum surveying lagged behind exploration. We organized four regional geological mapping teams, which, with the assistance of Soviet technical experts, are carrying out regular 1:200,000 regional geological mapping in the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Qinling Mountains, the Nanling Mountains, and the Altai Mountains. We also organized 19 hydrogeological and engineering geological teams to conduct hydrogeological surveys in the coastal areas of Shandong, the Qaidam area of Qinghai, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, and the Hohhot area of Inner Mongolia; groundwater exploration in key cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, Zhanjiang, and Baotou; and engineering geological work for the Yangtze River Three Gorges, Chongqing, Yibin, Yiluo, Danjiang, Sanmenxia, Xin'anjiang and other reservoir dam sites and the Yangtze River Bridge. In addition, we also organized 317 geophysical prospecting instrument teams and used magnetic, electrical, gravity, and seismic methods for prospecting. Aeromagnetic surveys have been used on a large scale in several petroleum surveying areas and magnetic metal mining areas. Electrical logging methods in coalfield exploration are also commonly used. With Soviet technical assistance, geodetic and aerial surveys were conducted in the Qilian Mountains, Xining-Qaidam, and Ordos regions. In 1956, we established seven research institutes (offices) for geology and mineral resources, mineral raw materials, geophysical prospecting, hydrogeology and engineering geology, exploration technology, and geomechanics, and began to systematically summarize the new experiences in science and technology in recent years. Who says that geological scientific research has been interrupted?

Some people say that geological scientific research has been interrupted or is not as good as before liberation. This is not in line with the facts. Of course, this does not mean that we deny the achievements of some geological workers before liberation. On the contrary, we believe that many geological workers in China have made achievements before liberation. For example, they conducted many geological surveys, compiled the 1:3,000,000 geological map of the country and a part of the 1:1,000,000 geological map, and conducted scientific research on paleontology, stratigraphy, and geotectonics. However, under the restrictions of the reactionary regime, they were limited to these research works and could not give full play to their role.

Since liberation, our scientific research work has been combined with production, serves production, and serves socialism. Our exploration of various ore deposits has undergone investigation, research, and scientific analysis and inference; and it has been carried out under the guidance of scientific theory. In the process of exploring these ore deposits, the experience of geological workers and the theory of geological science have been continuously enriched. This makes scientific research and production a unified process. Some people do not understand that the process of surveying and exploration is the process of geological scientific research, and the reserves obtained from exploration are the concentrated expression of the unification of scientific research and production. Therefore, they oppose production to scientific research. The erroneous idea that scientific research does not care about production and production is not scientific research, that is, research for the sake of research, has arisen.

The level of geological science and technology has been significantly improved compared with before liberation.

Since liberation, the number of geological science and technology cadres has increased significantly, and geological undertakings have developed rapidly, thereby obtaining extremely rich geological data and proposing many new scientific research topics. Therefore, the level of geological science and technology has been significantly improved in terms of both breadth and depth compared with before liberation. For example, Minister Li Siguang used the viewpoint of geomechanics to explain the theory of China's geotectonic features, which has been further developed based on many new data, and has been praised by many Chinese geologists and Soviet geologists. For example, Chinese geological scientists, in carrying out surveying, exploration, and regional geological mapping work, have gained a further understanding of those areas that were poorly studied or not studied in the past, such as the Junggar Basin, the Tarim Basin, the Altai region, the Qaidam Basin, the Qilian Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains, the Lhasa-Chamdo-Rikaze region, the Ordos Platform and the Alxa Block, the North China Plain, and the Songliao Plain. As for the development in ore deposit science and the achievements in surveying and exploration theory and technology methods, they are even more prominent. For example, the understanding of the classification of many ore deposit types and the rules of genesis and their distribution has been improved. The scientific and technological professional conferences we have held over the years have summarized many experiences in this area and published a batch of scientific and technological works. This has greatly improved the theoretical level of geological scientists in China. As for exploration methods, we did not know much about them in the past, but now we can master them. Many new technologies that were not used or rarely used in the past, such as aerial geological surveying, aerial topographic surveying, and methods such as heavy sand and metal content measurement, are now widely used. The Geological Institute of the Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Paleontology, the geological departments of various regions, and the research institutions of various ministries have done a lot of work in the above-mentioned areas. Therefore, we can definitely say that geological science and technology work in China has now stepped out of a narrow field and entered a comprehensive and comprehensive development stage.

Overcome shortcomings and errors and push geological work a step further.

Of course, this does not mean that our surveying and scientific research work has been done well enough, and the level of science and technology is already very high. On the contrary, our surveying work is still backward. Although we felt this problem in 1954 and gradually strengthened the proportion of surveying work year by year, it still cannot keep up with the needs of exploration. Now it seems that surveying work is not easy, the cadres we have equipped are not strong enough, and there are many shortcomings and errors in the work. There are many problems with regional geological mapping, and the quality of individual regions is not high enough. Our scientific and technological level is still not high. A large amount of practical data obtained over the years has not yet been systematically studied and sorted out, and the theoretical work of summarizing practical experience is not enough. The strength of stratigraphy and paleontology has developed less, which is far from meeting the current needs of the work. There are still many problems in the cooperation and coordination between the scientific research work of the Ministry of Geology and various aspects. Our scientific research institutions were also established late, and at present they are limited by the conditions of instruments and equipment. Scientific research work can only be gradually strengthened, with emphasis and step by step. It will take long-term and arduous efforts to catch up with the world level in comprehensive geological science and technology.

The above facts show that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government can geological work develop rapidly and comprehensively, and only under the socialist system can geological work be combined with the interests of the broad masses of the people. These facts completely shattered the absurd remarks of the rightists.

I believe that as long as we resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, consolidate the achievements we have made, and constantly overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work, China's geological undertakings will be further developed, and the mineral data needed for China's socialist construction will be more fully guaranteed.

    数字和事实驳倒了右派的谬论
    刘景范谈地质工作的巨大成就
    我完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长的各项报告。
    右派分子的反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动在各方面都有所表现。在地质工作方面他们说共产党领导不了地质工作，地质工作没有成绩，一九五六年更是一团糟，毫无成绩。我是做地质工作的，就地质工作有无成绩发表一些意见。
    一九五六年的地质工作，是在社会主义改造和社会主义建设高潮的形势下进行的。全体职工和科学技术人员，响应了中央的号召，以高度的社会主义积极性，进行了紧张的、艰苦的劳动，把地质工作又大大地向前推进了一步，使我们完全有可能提前和超额完成地质工作的第一个五年计划。
    去年的地质勘探工作大大超过前三年的总和
    一九五六年，地质部所属的地质勘探工作，在发展的规模和速度上，都大大地超过五年计划的前三年，勘探工作量和许多矿种的储量，超过了前三年的总和，四年之内基本上完成了五年计划中的矿产储量任务。地质普查和科学研究工作，都有了很大的发展和加强，我现在就一些数字和事实说明如下：
    一九五六年，地质部组织了一百二十六个勘探队，勘探了二十五种矿产。作为探明矿产的主要手段的钻探工作量，完成了一百二十六万公尺，为前三年钻探工作量总和的百分之一百三十七。四年累计完成了二百一十八万公尺，为五年计划的百分之八十六，预计一九五七年即将大大的超过五年计划规定的指标，另外还完成了竖井、斜井、平巷、浅井等工作量二十六万公尺，槽探一百九十八万立方公尺。
    由于一九五六年完成了这些工作量的结果，使各种矿产储量的增长速度大大的提高了，就一九五六年勘探的二十五种矿产来说，其中有十五种矿产所得的储量与前三年比较，有九种超过了前三年累计储量的总和。即是，锰超过百分之三，铅锌超过百分之七十，铝超过百分之一百九十二，钒超过百分之五百零一，铬超过百分之九百，金刚石超过百分之四十一。磷超过百分之一百五十三，压电石英（单晶块）超过百分之一百四十九，耐火粘土超过百分之七十五。有四种相当于前三年累计储量的百分之三十以上。即是，铁相当于百分之四十三，钛相当于百分之四十六，黄铁矿相当于百分之三十三，煤相当于百分之九十二，只有铜和锡两种储量低于百分之三十。其他前三年没有勘探的十种矿产如钼、镍、汞、石棉、云母、明矾、菱镁矿、型砂等，一九五六年也探明了相当的储量。
    矿产储量的迅速增长足以保证工业化需要
    由于一九五六年这些矿产储量的迅速增长，就使我们在四年之内基本上完成了五年计划。五年计划中地质部担负的十二种矿产储量。除钨矿储量已移交冶金部勘探外，其余十一种完成的情况是：铁完成百分之一百二十九，锰完成百分之一百五十八，铬完成百分之二十六，铜完成百分之一百零六，铅锌完成百分之一百四十八，铝完成百分之二百零九，锡完成百分之九十八，钼完成百分之九百六十四，煤完成百分之一百二十一，磷完成百分之三百二十四，黄铁矿完成百分之二百五十八。同时，还探明了钛、钒、镍、汞、菱镁矿、金刚石、石棉、云母、压电石英、明矾、黑色冶金辅助原料，油页岩等二十多种五年计划中没有规定的矿产储量。这些成果，只是我国地质工作的一部分，冶金、煤炭、化工、石油、建筑材料等部，也进行了很多普查勘探工作。把全国获得储量加在一起，就基本上保证了黑色冶金、有色冶金、燃料和部分非金属（如磷、硫）等大型企业在第一和第二个五年建设的需要。以煤、铁为例，从一九五三年到一九五六年为止，全国已探明了煤的储量二百零一亿吨，可以满足新建、扩建和恢复的矿井一百七十余对总设计能力近一亿吨的需要，解决了包头、武汉、鞍山、太原、石景山、重庆、马鞍山等钢铁厂的炼焦煤基地，同时也基本上保证了国家工业和交通的用煤。经过普查和预测，估计全国煤的总储量可能在一万二千亿吨以上。铁矿，解放前估计全国总储量三十亿吨。经过几年的工作，从已知的几十个主要矿区的预测，估计其总储量在一百一十亿吨以上。到一九五六年为止，全国已探明储量三十六亿吨。鞍山、本溪、包头三个钢铁厂资源已完全保证并有充足的后备。武汉、西北、西南、太原、石景山已能够保证第一期的建设或扩建。龙烟、阳泉、大渡口、福建、广东、新疆等中小型的钢铁厂所需的资源，也有了基本的保证。海南岛、山东、山西五台的铁矿还可以机动使用。总之，经过几年的工作，进一步证明了我国拥有丰富的矿产资源，它不仅是一个富产钨、锡、锑、煤、铁、铜、铅锌的国家，而且新近证实了还是一个富有钼矿的国家。这些矿产资源足以保证我国社会主义工业化的需要。
    右派先生们连这点常识都没有吗？
    我国大规模的地质勘探工作，是由一九五二年开始的，到一九五六年只有四年时间，探明这样多的矿物资源，这是中国历史上空前未有的巨大成绩。我国地质工作虽有三十多年的历史，但是在国民党反动政府的统治时期，他们不需要地质人员搞矿产勘探工作的，把我国丰富的矿物资源或者让帝国主义掠夺破坏，或者使它永远埋藏在地下，不能为人民创造幸福。解放以来，我国地质工作在共产党和人民政府领导下，勘探出大量的矿物资源，已经用于工业建设，已经和广大人民的物质生活发生了密切联系。这就是共产党领导的结果和社会主义优越性的具体表现。这些事实是全国人民所公认的，难道自称为“大知识分子”的右派先生们连这点常识都没有吗？显然不是这样，而是他们敌视这些成绩。因此，故意抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，颠倒是非，制造混乱，以便他们进行反党、反人民、反社会主义的勾当。
    当然，我们并不满足于这些成绩，我们自己知道我们的工作还有一些缺点和错误。比如：我们还有许多做得不够的地方，过去所勘探的矿种还不能全面地满足国家的需要。有些矿种对国家需要保证程度还很差，如铬、镍、云母、石棉、压电石英等虽然都找到了一些矿床，探明一部分储量，但储量还是很少的。有些矿种的储量，虽然数量不少，但由于品位不够高，也影响了建设的规模。如铁矿中的平炉富矿仍然极感不足。有些大型铜矿和铅锌矿的储量虽多，但由于品位稍低，开采面积小，限制了建设的规模。有的矿种分布不平衡，锰、磷的储量多集中于南方，煤多集中于北方，硫和磷的产地多配合不上。我们过去注意了满足建设大型企业的需要，着重找寻和勘探一些大的矿床，保证国家骨干企业的资源，这当然是必要的，但对建设中小型企业和地方企业需要的资源，注意不够，目前还不能满足。在稀有金属和分散元素方面，我们所做的工作就更少了。
    地质部一九五六年的年度计划中的实物工作量没有全面完成。矿产储量，有十六种完成和超额完成了，有七种完成得较差。没有全面完成计划的主要原因是计划订得偏高了一些。技术力量不足和设备供应不及时。有些矿床在勘探中变小了变贫了。加上一个时期由于机构的变动，使生产受了一些影响。劳动计划的偏高和执行中控制不严，多招收和接收了一批学生和职工，也增加了工作中一些困难。发生这些缺点的原因，有些是由于地质条件的限制，人力无法克服的；有些是由于经验不足；有些是我们工作中有官僚主义和主观主义的原因，这些缺点，有些我们已经在一九五七年的工作中纠正了，有些在整风运动中继续检查和纠正。
    普查工作的落后状况已有改进
    有人说，解放以后，我们只搞储量勘探，不搞普查和科学研究，是方针上的错误，这种说法是不正确的。在我国开始建设的时期，重工业部门对矿物资源的需要十分迫切，旧中国又没有给我们遗留下探明的矿产资源，为了解决资源问题，我们采取集中人力、物力进行重点勘探的方针，来解决这个急需解决的问题。这个方针是正确的。我们根据这个方针，积极努力，在几种主要矿产资源有了基本保证的时候，便逐渐加强了地质普查和科学研究工作。以一九五六年为例，我们组织了一百二十八个普查队，其中有十九个是苏联技术援助的普查检查大队。在几百个矿点中普查检查的结果，有四十多个矿物产地具有工业价值。其中规模较大的有江西的铜矿、甘肃的铜矿和铜镍矿，陕西的钼矿、广东和福建的富铁矿、鄂西的铁矿、贵州的铅锌矿、湖北和湖南的磷矿、青海压电石英和铅锌矿等。使普查工作的落后状况有了改善。我们组织了十二个石油普查大队，在新疆、柴达木、华北平原、松辽平原、四川盆地、鄂尔多斯地台、贵州、广西等地区进行了四十余万平方公里的普查测量工作，又发现了一批可能储油的构造，改善了石油普查落后于勘探的局面。我们组织了四个区域地质测量大队，在苏联技术专家的援助下，在大兴安岭、秦岭、南岭、阿尔泰地区进行着正规的一比二十万的区域地质测量。我们还组织了十九个水文地质和工程地质大队，在山东滨海区、青海柴达木地区、甘肃河西走廊、内蒙呼和浩特等地区进行水文地质调查；在北京、西安、湛江、包头等重点城市的地下水勘探；在长江三峡、重庆、宜宾、伊洛、丹江、三门峡、新安江等水库坝址及长江大桥的工程地质工作。此外，我们还组织了三百一十七个地球物理探矿仪器队，采用磁法、电法、重力、地震等方法进行探矿。航空磁测已在若干石油普查区和有磁性的金属矿区大规模的运用。煤田勘探中的电测井方法也普遍运用。在苏联技术援助下，进行了祁连山、西宁—柴达木、鄂尔多斯等地区的大地测量及航空测量工作。我们在一九五六年内，建立了地质矿产、矿物原料、地球物理探矿、水文地质和工程地质、勘探技术、地质力学等七个研究所（室），着手系统地总结几年来科学技术上的新经验。谁说地质科学研究中断了？
    有人说，解放以后的地质科学研究中断了，或者不如解放以前了，这是不符合事实的。当然，这并不是说我们否认解放以前一些地质工作者的成绩。相反，我们认为在解放以前，我国许多地质工作者的工作是有成绩的。比如：他们进行了许多地质调查工作，编制了全国三百万分之一的地质图和一部分一百万分之一的地质图，进行了古生物、地层和大地构造等科学研究工作。但是，在反动政权的限制之下，他们也就仅仅限于这些研究工作，而不能充分发挥他们的作用。
    解放以后，我们的科学研究工作是和生产相结合的，是为生产服务的，是为社会主义服务的。我们对各种矿床的勘探，都经过了调查研究和科学的分析推断；并在科学理论的指导下进行的。在这些矿床的勘探过程中，又不断的丰富了地质工作者的经验，丰富了地质科学的理论。这就使科学研究与生产形成一个统一的过程。有些人不了解普查和勘探的过程，就是地质科学研究的过程，勘探所得的储量，就是科学研究与生产统一起来的集中表现。因此，他们就把生产和科学研究对立起来。产生了科学研究不管生产，生产不是科学研究，也就是为研究而研究的错误思想。
    地质科学技术水平比解放前有显著提高
    解放以来，地质科学技术干部有了大量增长，地质事业突飞猛进，从而取得了极其丰富的地质资料，提出了许多科学研究的新课题。因此，地质科学技术水平不论在宽度和深度方面比解放以前都有显著的提高。比如：李四光部长用地质力学的观点，阐明我国大地构造特征的学说，根据许多新的资料又有新的发展，并得到了许多中国地质学者及苏联地质学家的赞扬。又如我国地质科学人员，在进行普查勘探和区域地质测量工作中，对于那些过去研究程度很差的或没有研究过的地区，如对准噶尔盆地、塔里木盆地、阿尔泰地区、柴达木盆地、祁连山和昆仑山地区、拉萨—昌都—日喀则地区、鄂尔多斯地台和阿拉善地块、华北平原、松辽平原都有了进一步的了解。至于在矿床学上的发展和普查勘探理论与技术方法上的成就那就更突出了。比如对许多矿床类型的划分和生成规律及其分布规律的认识，都有所提高。历年来我们所召开的科学技术性的专业会议，总结了这方面的许多经验，出版了一批科学技术的论著。这就大大提高了我国地质科学工作者的理论水平。至于勘探方法，过去我们是不大会的，现在可以掌握了。许多过去没有采用过或很少采用的新技术如航空地质测量、航空地形测量，以及重砂、金属量测量等等方法，现在已经广泛的采用了。在上述各个方面，科学院的地质研究所、古生物研究所、各地质院系和各部的研究机构都作了不少的工作。因此，我们可以肯定的说，现在我国地质科学技术工作已经走出了狭小的领域而进入了一个全面的综合的发展阶段。
    克服缺点和错误，把地质工作推进一步
    当然，这并不是说我们的普查和科学研究工作已经做得很够了，科学技术水平已经很高了。相反，我们的普查工作还是落后的，虽然我们在一九五四年就感到了这个问题，并逐年加强了普查工作的比重，但直到现在还是赶不上勘探的需要。现在看来普查工作是不容易的，我们所配备的干部还不够强，工作中的缺点错误也很多。区域地质测量的问题很多，个别地区的质量也不够高。我们的科学技术水平还是不高的，几年来获得的大批实际资料还没来得及系统的研究与整理，概括实践经验的理论工作做得很不够，地层、古生物的力量发展较小，远不能适应当前工作的需要。地质部的科学研究工作，与各方面的配合协作还有很多问题，我们的科学研究机构也设立得迟了一些，目前又限于仪器设备的条件，科学研究工作只能逐步加强，有重点的有步骤的进行。要在全面的地质科学技术上赶上世界水平，还要作长期的艰巨的努力。
    由以上的事实说明，只有在共产党和人民政府的领导之下，地质工作才有可能迅速地全面地发展，只有在社会主义制度之下，地质工作才有可能与广大人民的利益结合起来。这些事实彻底粉碎了右派分子的荒谬言论。
    我相信，只要我们坚决的服从党的领导，巩固已得的成绩，不断的克服工作中的缺点和错误，我国的地质事业就会得到更进一步的发展，我国社会主义建设所需要的矿产资料就会得到更全面的保证。
