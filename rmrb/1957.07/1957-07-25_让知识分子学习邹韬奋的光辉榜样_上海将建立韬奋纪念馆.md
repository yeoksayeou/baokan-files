Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: The 24th is the thirteenth anniversary of the death of Zou Taofen, a prominent modern political commentator, journalist, and publisher. The Ministry of Culture has decided to establish the Taofen Memorial Hall in Wanyi Lane, Chongqing South Road, Shanghai, where Taofen lived. The preparatory committee has been established and is striving to establish it preliminarily by the end of October this year. The address of this memorial hall is where Taofen and progressive cultural figures carried out revolutionary activities at that time. The memorial hall will include an exhibition room and a former residence. Taofen's former residence will be arranged exactly as it was during his lifetime.

Taofen's wife, Shen Cuizhen, told reporters that Taofen's life of struggle is a shining example of an intellectual embarking on the revolutionary road. Today, Taofen's ideals of twenty years ago have all been realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I really didn't expect that Zhang Naiqi and Wang Zaoshi, who were arrested with Taofen as part of the Seven Gentlemen incident, would still oppose socialism and the Communist Party today, which makes me extremely indignant!

    让知识分子学习邹韬奋的光辉榜样
    上海将建立韬奋纪念馆
    据新华社上海23日电　24日是中国近代杰出的政论家、新闻记者、出版家邹韬奋逝世十三周年纪念日。文化部决定在上海韬奋生前居住的地方——重庆南路万宜坊建立韬奋纪念馆。筹备委员会已经成立，争取在今年10月底初步建立起来。这个纪念馆的地址是韬奋和进步文化人士当时进行革命活动的地方。纪念馆将包括陈列室和故居两部分。韬奋故居将完全按照他生前的陈设布置。
    韬奋夫人沈粹缜对记者说，韬奋一生奋斗的经历，是一个知识分子走上革命道路的光辉榜样。今天，韬奋二十年前的理想在中国共产党领导下已全部实现了。真想不到当年与韬奋一道被捕的七君子中章乃器、王造时到现在还要反对社会主义，反对共产党，这使我万分愤慨！
