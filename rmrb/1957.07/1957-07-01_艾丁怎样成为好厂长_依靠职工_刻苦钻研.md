Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. Ai Ding, the factory director of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and a Communist Party member with nineteen years of party membership, is praised by the non-Party technical and management personnel of the factory. This factory was formerly an agricultural tool repair shop. Now, it is a large-scale precision machine tool factory in the country with the most types of machine tools produced. All the targets of the Five-Year Plan were reached ahead of schedule in October last year. At present, the factory can produce more than 1,700 precision grinding machines of 25 models a year, and the output has increased by more than two times compared with 1953. The management level is also relatively high among the machine tool factories in the country. In 1955 and 1956, it won the first place in the national inter-factory competition of machine tool factories for two consecutive times.

Li Gen, the chief engineer of the factory, said that because Factory Director Ai is willing to study diligently, he has mastered some basic rules of managing a machine tool factory and leads such a complex production factory very well. Fan Wufei, the head of the planning section, and Tao Long, the head of the capital construction section and an engineer, all mentioned unanimously that Ai Ding is good at relying on the masses in his work. In 1953, when Ai Ding first became the factory director, the production order in the factory was very chaotic, the parts produced were not complete, and the production plan could not be completed. At that time, Ai Ding led everyone to study relevant books and documents, and at the same time, they discussed the steps and methods for implementing planned management in the factory, so that the production order gradually became normal. They also said that in 1954, the factory's products were heavily stockpiled because of the small variety and outdated styles, while the products needed domestically could not be manufactured. The higher authorities required the machine tool factory to quickly trial-produce new products to meet the needs of construction. However, the technical strength in the factory was insufficient. At this time, Factory Director Ai mobilized everyone to discuss solutions and decided to greatly promote excellent workers to take up leadership positions at all levels. At the same time, he transferred 30 to 40 technical personnel from various departments of the factory to enrich the design and process systems, and copied Soviet-style grinding machines according to Soviet technical data. In this way, the variety of products in the factory increased rapidly. Before 1953, only one new product could be trial-produced in a year. In 1954, seven were trial-produced. Since the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, 26 new products have been successfully trial-produced, exceeding the four stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. At present, the technical personnel in the factory are transitioning from imitating Soviet products to self-design.

They believe that Factory Director Ai's hard work and the working style of consulting with everyone in case of trouble are very valuable qualities of the old Communist Party cadres. Who can say that the Communist Party does not understand technology and cannot lead industrial production!

Ai Ding went to Yan'an from his hometown in Sichuan in 1937. Since then, he has worked in the Party committee organs for a long time and has never engaged in industry. He only transferred to the industrial front after liberation. (Picture attached)

    艾丁怎样成为好厂长
    依靠职工　刻苦钻研
    新华社上海30日电　上海机床厂厂长、有着十九年党龄的共产党员艾丁，受到这个厂非党技术人员和管理人员的称赞。这个厂过去是个农具修配厂，现在是全国规模较大、生产的机床种类最多的精密机床工厂，五年计划的各项指标已在去年10月提前达到。目前，全厂一年能够生产二十五种型号的精密磨床一千七百多台，产量比1953年增加了两倍多，管理水平也是全国机床工厂中较高的。1955年和1956年曾经连续两次获得全国机床厂厂际竞赛第一名。
    这个厂的总工程师李艮说，由于艾厂长肯刻苦钻研和学习，他已经掌握了管理机床工厂的一些基本规律，把这样一个生产很复杂的工厂领导得很好。计划科长范悟飞和基本建设科长、工程师陶龙等，都一致谈到艾丁在工作中善于依靠群众。1953年，艾丁初任厂长时，厂内生产秩序很乱，零件出产不成套，生产计划不能完成。当时，艾丁就率领大家学习有关这方面的书籍和文件，同时一起讨论在厂内实施计划管理的步骤方法，使生产秩序逐步正常起来。他们又说：1954年，厂里产品因为品种少、式样老，曾经大批积压；国内需要的产品又制造不出来。上级部门要求机床厂迅速试制新产品，满足建设需要。但是，厂内技术力量不足。这时，艾厂长就发动大家讨论办法，决定一面大量提拔优秀职工担任各级领导，同时从全厂各个部门抽调技术人员三、四十人充实设计、工艺系统，根据苏联技术资料，仿造苏式磨床。就这样，厂里的品种迅速增加了，1953年以前还只能一年试制一种新产品，1954年就试制了七种；第一个五年计划开始以来试制成功的新产品已经有二十六种，超过了五年计划的规定四种。目前，厂内的技术人员又在从仿造苏联产品向自行设计的方向过渡。
    他们认为：艾厂长的这种刻苦学习，遇事同大家商量的工作作风，正是共产党老干部非常可贵的品质。谁能说共产党不懂技术不能领导工业生产呢！
