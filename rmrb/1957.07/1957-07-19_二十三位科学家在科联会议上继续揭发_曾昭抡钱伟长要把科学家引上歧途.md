Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Scientists participating in the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (CAST) today continued to refute the anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership statements and actions of rightists Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang. The scientists present expressed their firm support for the Communist Party's leadership over scientific work and their wholehearted dedication to serving socialist construction.

Twenty-three scientists, representatives from various specialized academic societies, and local CAST branches spoke at today's meeting.

Standing Committee member of the National Committee, Bing Zhi, said that he and Zeng Zhaolun were colleagues more than thirty years ago. Zeng gradually left the laboratory later on, got involved with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and steadily declined. Today, more than thirty years later, Zeng has fallen into the rightist mire, and this is not accidental. Bing Zhi demanded that Zeng and Qian not gloss over their mistakes but make a thorough confession.

National Committee member Tao Shuceng said that when Qian Weichang passed through Wuhan in March this year, he gave a report at the Wuhan Science Popularization Association. Qian Weichang began his report with a map and launched into a tirade, saying that today's scientific work was full of shortcomings and errors in all aspects. At the time, I felt that Qian Weichang's words did not sound like those of a scientist. Looking at it in retrospect, Qian Weichang was also conducting anti-Party propaganda on this chance occasion, and it is deceptive to say that his opposition to the Party and socialism was unplanned.

Tao Shuceng then cited his personal experiences in his work to refute the fallacies of rightists who say "laymen cannot lead experts" and "the Communist Party cannot lead science and technology." Tao Shuceng said that, taking Wuhan's flood control work in 1954 as an example, this was a very complex scientific and technical undertaking. At that time, I served as the chief engineer of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters and often worked with Wang Renzhong, the mayor of Wuhan at the time and now the First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the CPC. Wang Renzhong did not understand water conservancy technology, but because he had a Marxist-Leninist worldview, a scientific way of thinking, rich work experience, and a strong mass perspective, the summaries he made and the technical measures he decided on at each flood control meeting were very correct, meeting both the requirements of science and technology and the specific realities of the time. Therefore, under his leadership, the flood control work achieved a great victory. Although I was the chief engineer, I admit that I was not as good as him in this regard. This shows that Communist Party members are capable of leading science and technology.

Vice President of the Chinese Medical Association, Fang Shishan, used the achievements made by the Chinese Medical Association in the past eight years under the leadership of the Party to refute the fallacies of the rightists at the meeting. He said that the Chinese Medical Association was very disorganized before liberation, and academic activities were extremely limited. After liberation, it united under the leadership of the Party, and academic activities have increased day by day. These achievements are inseparable from the Party's correct leadership over science. Scientists are enjoying unprecedented respect, care, and trust. The rightists' attempt to make the thriving country led by the Party deviate from the socialist path and to lure scientists onto a wrong and lost path is absolutely impossible.

Zhang Wei emphasized at today's meeting that Qian Weichang has consistently advocated taking the capitalist road in education. He denied the achievements of teaching reform, believing that the Party brought dogmatism. Regarding the issue of training objectives, Qian believed that engineering disciplines should not take "engineers" as the training direction and opposed students learning specialized courses. Zhang Wei said that Qian Weichang's advocacy is essentially to cultivate "generalists," believing that "if you study mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you can go anywhere without fear," attempting to take the old road of old higher education before liberation. Qian also spread rumors in front of Zhang Wei that the Harbin Institute of Technology had canceled graduation design this year, attempting to achieve his goal of opposing graduation design by spreading rumors.

Yue Jieheng of the Xi'an CAST said that Qian Weichang calls himself an all-powerful scientist and says that even if the Communist Party invites him, he will not join the Party. These two points prove that he is a charlatan and dishonest person. Science is a down-to-earth discipline, and scientists are down-to-earth people. The more truly talented scientific workers are, the more specialized and profound their attainments are. The so-called all-powerful scientist that Qian Weichang talks about is deceptive. He said that in the current anti-rightist struggle, I deeply feel the importance of ideological remolding of intellectuals. We should actively participate in the current anti-rightist struggle and consciously strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism in order to serve the people more effectively.

Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee, Tu Changwang, said that judging from the revealed materials, the conspiratorial activities of Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang were planned, organized, had a program, and were carried out step by step. Tu Changwang pointed out that this anti-socialist scientific program, as Zeng Zhaolun confessed, was not only a so-called "taking the lead," but can be said to be a program for inciting scientists to oppose the leadership of the Party. Tu Changwang said that on the issue of scientific planning, Zeng and Qian played a worse role than Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

National Committee member Mao Yisheng pointed out at the meeting that Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang's opposition to the Party's leadership of science was part of the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance. They attempted to seize intellectuals as political capital to open a gap in science.

National Committee member Cheng Xiaogang cited Luo Longji's confession at the National People's Congress, pointing out that the rightists had a kind of liaison meeting to quickly expand their influence, but Zeng and Qian have not yet confessed. He asked Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang: How many people did you collude with? Zeng said in his confession that the group was only established on May 13, but he also said that the reactionary program sought extensive opinions. If it were not a meticulous plan, how could this short period of time be arranged?

Standing Committee member of the National Committee, Hua Luogeng, exposed Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang for using conspiracies and tricks to drag him into anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. He questioned Zeng Zhaolun: Why was this reactionary scientific program published without seeking everyone's agreement? He said that when Zeng Zhaolun and I went to the United States to investigate national defense science, he introduced Yu Dawei to me, saying, "Yu Dawei is not a member of the Kuomintang but has risen to his position through his own abilities." He also said: "The Kuomintang is not good, old Chiang is not good, Chen Cheng is still okay." Hua Luogeng said that Zeng Zhaolun was then hedging his bets, one on Chen Cheng's faction and the other on the China Democratic League. He may have been using the China Democratic League as a cover to take the dangerous route of Chen Cheng through Yu Dawei. He said that soon after I returned to China, Zeng Zhaolun provoked my relationship with the Academy of Sciences. He asked me if I had been to the Academy of Sciences? I said no. He said, "It's better not to go." Hua Luogeng also exposed Qian Weichang's consistent practice of playing both sides and creating rumors. After he returned to China, Qian Weichang visited him with a reporter, but Qian arranged for the reporter to wait outside while he first told Hua Luogeng that the Academy of Sciences had decided not to let him enter the Academy of Sciences. Hua Luogeng said that when colleges and universities were considering the adjustment of departments, he wrote an article entitled "We Should Only Have One Tradition - The Tradition of Serving the People," but Qian Weichang said: "Be careful when firing, don't hit your own people." It turned out that he had already come up with a plan to adjust departments to confront the Party. Hua Luogeng said that after the rectification movement began this time, Qian Weichang repeatedly mobilized him to "speak out" and "air views." Hua Luogeng wrote an article entitled "Is Science Closer to Engineering? Or Closer to Liberal Arts?" He took it and posted it at the entrance of the Science Museum of Tsinghua University, asking people to sign it, and distorted it, telling others that Hua Luogeng expressed his opinion because he wanted to be the director of the Mathematics Department of Tsinghua University, but he told Hua Luogeng that Tsinghua could build a building for the Mathematics Research Institute and invite him to be the director of the Mathematics Department.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Wang Junkui, representative of the Aeronautical Engineering Society, Yan Kaiyuan of the Shanxi CAST, Li Zongen, Standing Committee member of the National Committee, Yang Shixian, Chen Yide, Zhao Zukang, Hua Shujia of the Harbin CAST, Shen Jiarui, representative of the Zoological Society, Zhou Ren of the Metal Society, Wu Juenong of the Agricultural Society, Hou Xianglin of the Chemical Industry Society, and Yang Zhongjian of the Paleontological Society, etc.

Qian Weichang confessed at today's meeting his relationship with Chu Anping, as well as his activities on June 5th and 6th. He said that he met Chu Anping at a meeting in 1952 through Jing Fuxiao's introduction. He said that he and Chu Anping hit it off because both of them were quite arrogant. Qian said that on May 26, Chu Anping went to Peking University because he had something to do, and took the opportunity to see him at 2:30 in the afternoon, and the two chatted for an hour. Upon review, the content of the chat was political. Chu told Qian that he was going to take over Guangming Daily and asked Qian to write articles. Qian said at the time that Guangming Daily should not only invite university professors to write articles, but also invite engineers and primary and secondary school teachers to write articles. Qian said that he later learned that Chu did plan to organize a forum for engineers and primary and secondary school teachers after that conversation. Qian said that they also talked about the issue of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and Chu mentioned the number of teachers who were criticized at the Northeast Institute of Technology, etc. Qian asked him where he got the material, but Chu did not answer. They also talked about the boundaries of "speaking out" and "airing views." Chu told Qian that he was preparing to publish reports on the "Peking University Democracy Wall" in Guangming Daily, but the Guangming Daily Party group disagreed, and he wanted to continue the "struggle." Chu also said that he wanted to learn from Wenhui Daily. Qian said that Chu also asked him what was the most serious problem at Tsinghua University, and he replied at the time that it was sectarianism. Chu then said, "Sects are everywhere, sects rule the world." Now it seems that this is Chu's "Party rules the world" argument.

Qian Weichang said that the emergency meeting convened by Zhang Bojun on June 6 was promoted by him. He said that the reason he promoted this meeting was that since the rectification campaign, he had been in opposition to the school's Party committee, believing that the Tsinghua University Party committee had "sectarianism" and had been searching for facts to prove his point. He also believed that Tsinghua University's "sectarianism" could only be resolved by the central government. Qian said that his activities and speeches on June 5th and 6th were aimed at encouraging the China Democratic League to go to the central government. Qian said that this was entirely due to his own erroneous thinking, and by this time he had completely relied on Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Qian said that this time the Party saved him, and the counterattack against the rightists gave him a blow to the head. If he had gone on for another ten or twenty days, he did not know what great crimes he would have committed. He expressed his sincere acceptance of criticism and his complete confession.

Zeng Zhaolun said today that he was willing to bow his head and plead guilty to the people, but he still did not make any specific confession.

    二十三位科学家在科联会议上继续揭发
    曾昭抡钱伟长要把科学家引上歧途
    据新华社18日讯  参加全国科联全国委员会扩大会议的科学家们，今天继续驳斥右派分子曾昭抡、钱伟长的反社会主义反对党的领导的言行。到会科学家表示坚决拥护共产党对科学工作的领导，一心一意为社会主义建设服务。
    今天在会上发言的有二十三位科学家、各专门学会和各地科联分会的代表。
    全国委员会常务委员秉志说，他和曾昭抡是三十多年前的同事。曾后来慢慢地离开实验室，和章罗搞在一起，每况愈下。三十多年后的今天，曾掉入了右派泥坑，这不是偶然的。秉志要求曾、钱不要蒙混过关，要彻底交代。
    全国委员会委员陶述曾说，钱伟长今年3月路过武汉时，在武汉科普作了一次报告。钱伟长在报告中从一张地图说起，大骂一通，说今天的科学工作各方面都是缺点和错误。当时我就感到钱伟长说出这样的话，不像一位科学家。现在联系起来看，钱伟长在这一个偶然的机会里也在进行反党宣传，要说他反党反社会主义是没有计划的，那是骗人的。
    陶述曾接着举出他在工作中的亲身体验，驳斥右派分子所说的“外行不能领导内行”“共产党不能领导科学技术”的谬论。陶述曾说，以1954年武汉市的防汛工作来说，这是一项很复杂的科学技术工作。那时，我担任武汉防汛指挥部的总工程师，经常和武汉市市长现任中共湖北省委第一书记王任重一起工作。王任重是不懂水利技术的，但是由于他有马列主义的世界观，有科学的思想方法，有丰富的工作经验和强烈的群众观点，因此，他在每次防汛会议上所作的总结和所决定的每项技术措施，都是非常正确的，既符合科学技术的要求，又切合当时的具体实际。因此，在他的领导下，防汛工作取得了伟大的胜利。我虽然是总工程师，但是我自认在这方面就不如他。这说明共产党员是能够领导科学技术的。
    中华医学会副会长方石珊在会上以中华医学会八年来在党的领导下取得的成就来驳斥右派分子的谬论。他说，中华医学会解放前很涣散，学术活动极有限，解放后在党的领导下团结起来了，学术活动日益增加。这些成就和党对科学的正确领导是分不开的。科学家正享受着从所未有的尊重、爱护和信任。右派分子妄想使党所领导的欣欣向荣的国家背离社会主义道路，企图引诱科学家走上错误的迷途，是绝对办不到的。
    张维在今天的会上着重指出钱伟长在教育工作上一贯主张走资本主义路线。他否定教学改革的成就，认为是党带来了教条。关于培养目标的问题，钱认为工科可以不以“工程师”为培养方向，反对学生学专业课。张维说，钱伟长的主张实质上是培养“通才”，认为“学了数理化，走遍天下都不怕”，企图走解放前旧高等教育的老路。钱还在张维面前造谣说哈尔滨工业大学今年取消了毕业设计，企图以造谣来达到他反对毕业设计的目的。
    西安科联岳劼恒说，钱伟长自命为万能的科学家，并说什么共产党来请他，他也不参加党，从这两点就可以证明他是招摇撞骗，毫不老实的人。科学是老老实实的学问，科学家是老老实实的人。越是有真才实学的科学工作者，造诣越专而深。钱伟长所说的万能科学家，那是骗人的。他说，在当前的反右派斗争中，我深深感到知识分子思想改造的重要。我们应该积极参加当前的反右派斗争，自觉地加强马列主义的学习，以便更有效地为人民服务。
    全国委员会副秘书长涂长望说，从已经揭露的材料看，曾昭抡、钱伟长的阴谋活动是有计划、有组织、有纲领和有步骤的。涂长望指出这个反社会主义的科学纲领不仅如曾昭抡交代的所谓“抢先一步”，可以说是煽动科学家起来反对党的领导的行动的纲领。涂长望说，在科学规划这个问题上，曾、钱所起的坏作用比章、罗还要大。
    全国委员会委员茅以升在会上指出，曾昭抡、钱伟长反对党对科学的领导是章罗联盟反党反社会主义阴谋活动的一部分，他们企图抓知识分子作政治资本来在科学方面打开一个缺口。
    全国委员会委员程孝刚引用罗隆基在人代会交代的材料，指出右派分子有一种串连会，很快扩大他们的影响，但曾、钱现在还没有交代。他问曾昭抡、钱伟长：到底串连了多少人。曾在交代中说小组是5月13日才成立的，但又说反动纲领征求了广泛的意见，如果不是周密的计划，这短短的时间如何安排？
    全国委员会常务委员华罗庚揭发曾昭抡、钱伟长使用阴谋诡计，拖他做反党反社会主义的事情。他质问曾昭抡：这个反动科学纲领的稿子为什么没有征求大家同意就拿出去发表。他说，曾昭抡和我到美国去考察国防科学时，他向我介绍俞大维说，“俞大维不是国民党员而是靠自己本事起家的”。他还说：“国民党不好，老蒋不好，陈诚还好”。华罗庚说，曾昭抡当时是脚踏两条船，一条是陈诚派，一条是民盟。他可能是以民盟做幌子，而通过俞大维走陈诚门路的危险人物。他说，我回国不久，曾昭抡就挑拨我和科学院的关系，他问我到过科学院没有？我说没有。他说，“不去也好”。华罗庚还揭发钱伟长一贯玩弄两面手法造谣生事的恶劣作风，他回国后，钱伟长就同一位记者访问他，但钱却把记者安顿在门外，自己先告诉华罗庚说，科学院已决定不让他进科学院。华罗庚说，高等学校酝酿院系调整时，他写了一篇题为“我们只应当有一个传统——为人民服务的传统”的文章，而钱伟长却说：“开炮的小心点，不要打了自己人。”原来他当时已搞出一个和党对抗的院系调整方案。华罗庚说，这次整风运动开始以后，钱伟长就三番五次动员他“鸣”“放”。华罗庚曾写了一篇“理与工接近呢？还是与文法接近呢？”的文章，他就拿去贴在清华大学科学馆门口，请人签名，并加以歪曲，对别人说华罗庚发表意见是想做清华大学数学系主任，而对他又说清华可以给数学研究所盖一所房子，请他作数学系主任。
    在今天会上发言的，还有航空工程学会代表王俊奎、山西科联严开元、全国委员会常务委员李宗恩、委员杨石先、陈一得、赵祖康、哈尔滨科联华树嘉、动物学会代表沈嘉瑞、金属学会周仁、农学会吴觉农、化工学会侯祥麟、古生物学会杨钟健等。
    钱伟长在今天的会上，交代了他和储安平的关系，以及6月5日、6日两天的活动情况。他说，他是在1952年的一个会上经费孝通的介绍认识储安平的。他说他和储安平气味相投，因为两人都是相当自高自大的。钱说，5月26日，储安平因有事到北京大学，在下午二时半趁便去看了他，两人闲聊了一小时。现在检查起来，闲聊的内容是政治性的。储告诉钱，他要接办光明日报，约钱写稿。钱当时说，光明日报不要只请大学教授写稿，应该也请些工程师和中、小学教师写稿。钱说，后来知道那次谈话后储确实打算组织工程师和中小学教师的座谈会。钱说，那次还谈到肃反问题，储说了东北工学院被斗争的教师的数目等等，钱问他那里来的材料，储没有回答。他们还谈到“鸣”“放”的界线问题。储告诉钱准备在光明日报登“北大民主墙”的报道，光明日报党组不同意，他要继续“斗争”。储还说要向文汇报学习。钱说，储还问他清华大学什么问题最严重，当时他回答说是宗派主义。储就说，“到处是宗派，宗派皆天下”。现在看来就是储的“党天下”的论调。
    钱伟长说，6月6日章伯钧召集的紧急会议是由他推动的。他说，他推动这次会议的原因是整风以来，他一直和学校的党委对立，认为清华大学的党委有“宗派”，并且四出找寻事实来证明自己的看法。他还认为清华大学的“宗派”，非由中央来解决不可。钱将6月5日、6日的活动和言论，说是想鼓励民盟去找中央。钱说，这完全是由于自己的错误思想，发展到这时候已经完全投靠到章罗的门下了。钱说，这次是党挽救了他，反击右派给他当头一棒，如果再过十天二十天，他不知要犯下多大的罪行，他表示诚心诚意地接受批判，作彻底交代。
    曾昭抡今天表示愿意向人民低头请罪，但仍然没有作什么具体交代。
