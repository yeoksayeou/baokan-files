Firmly Stand One's Ground, Draw a Clear Line of Demarcation
Li Shaochun

I am angry! I am very angry! The right-wing elements dared to take advantage of our Party's call for rectification to employ their monstrous tricks, wildly attacking the Party, and attempting to usurp the Party's leadership. Their vile and shameless methods, whether in the scientific community, the literary and art circles, the industrial and commercial circles... in every corner, they stop at nothing. They are colluding with and exploiting some muddle-headed people, acting as accomplices, with utter disregard for conscience, wantonly slandering the Party's leadership, thoroughly anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. This is a major event that we cannot and will not tolerate. We should firmly stand our ground, draw a clear line of demarcation, and throw ourselves into this class struggle on the political front and the class struggle on the ideological front.

Normally, we often hear some people say: "I have received the Party's education, the Party's cultivation, the Party's grace, and the Party's warmth. I must resolutely follow the Communist Party!" Although these words are said, the most important thing is to prove your words with actions. Now, at this critical juncture, it should be like the ancient saying: "Strong grass is known in a high wind." Just as this fierce and evil wind is attacking our Party, some people, while claiming to have been confusedly exploited by the right-wing elements, have actually become people who "fan the flames." I think: When they examine themselves, simply saying "I will definitely stand firm, draw a clear line of demarcation, and fight the right-wing elements to the end" is empty and useless. They should boldly, bravely, and honestly expose the premeditated conspiracies of the right-wing elements. Only in this way can they show "strong grass" in the "high wind."

What is heartbreaking and infuriating is that the right-wing elements' actions of setting fires in the literary and art circles have specifically extended into our China Peking Opera Theatre. The facts exposed in the newspapers on the 15th are obvious to all. This vicious conspiracy is clearly aimed at destroying our opera cause, dragging those actors who have been gradually improved by the Party's education after liberation back to the old society, to achieve their delusional dream of capitalist restoration! Friends! Who doesn't have a heart? Who doesn't have a conscience! Let us think carefully: What kind of life did we artists live in the past? What was our status in the old society? Although we had some achievements in performing skills, how did those jackals and ghosts in the old society view you? The recent past is not far away, the old dreams are still warm, looking at the present and recalling the past, how can we not be awe-stricken! As the saying goes, talking about tigers makes you pale, and pain after reflection, we should have a clear understanding. Personally speaking: It is true that the name Li Shaochun was known to some people in the past. But the reason why Li Shaochun was known was only for the sake of "eating." Even the simple problem of eating was not so simple. In order to support a family of dozens of people to fill their stomachs, I had to go on stage no matter what the environment. I remember one summer, I was performing "Striking the Golden Brick" when suddenly I got cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, and after emergency treatment, I barely recovered. But I had to perform, mainly not because the theater disagreed, but because I had to eat and wait for the rice to be cooked, so it was impossible not to perform while sick. I think fellow performers would have the same feeling! Today, after liberation, such things are absolutely gone. The Party's care for us is truly meticulous. It takes care of us in life, respects us in status, promotes us in art, and encourages us in our careers. We live a happy life, truly pursuing art. In recent years, our status at home and abroad has truly been "a hundred-foot pole, moving upward day by day." Anyone with a conscience, how can they not love our Party intimately; respect our Party's leadership; and sincerely defend our Party's leadership? Recently, my throat has been bothering me a bit. The organization not only introduced me to a hospital for examination and treatment, but also told me to rest more. During the rest period, they arranged appropriate learning opportunities for me. I think: This is not only for me alone, but for all comrades. The Party's leadership is truly great! Warm! With iron-like facts here, what reason is there to extinguish conscience and slander the Party without distinguishing right from wrong? However, now there are some people who have already approached the edge of the right-wing elements and have publicly done some things for the right-wing elements. How can this not make people angry! Very angry!

After all, the Party is wise! The people's eyes are sharp! They can see that although you have approached the edge of the right-wing elements, you are actually being drawn in and exploited. You should be grateful to the Party and the people for extending a benevolent hand to help you out of the mire! I think: Anyone with a conscience should feel this, turn back immediately, truly stand firm, draw a clear line of demarcation, and expose the despicable and filthy conspiracies of the right-wing elements as much as possible.

    站稳立场，划清界限
    李少春
    我愤怒！我非常愤怒！右派分子们，竟敢乘着我们党号召整风的时候，施展其魍魉伎俩，猖狂地向党进攻，妄想篡夺党的领导。他们那卑鄙无耻的手段，不论在科学界、文艺界、工商界……每个角落里，无所不用其极。拉拢利用些头脑不清楚的人，为虎作伥，丧尽天良的肆意诬蔑党的领导，彻头彻尾的反党，反人民，反社会主义。这是我们不能容忍而且不可容忍的大事，我们应当坚决的站稳立场，划清界限，投入这政治战线上的阶级斗争，思想战线上的阶级斗争。
    平日，常常听到有些人说：“我如何如何的受到党的教育，党的培养，党的恩惠，党的温暖，我一定要坚决的跟着共产党走！”话尽管是这样说了，最重要的，应当用行动来证明自己的话。到了现在这个紧要关头，那就应着古人那句话：“疾风知劲草”了。就在这阵子疾戾的邪风进攻我们党的时候，就有些人口称是糊里糊涂的受了右派分子的利用，而实际上已然作了“迎风放火”的人。我想：在他们检查自己的时候，空说什么“我一定站稳立场，划清界限，和右派分子斗争到底。”是空洞的，无用的。应当大胆地，勇敢地，老实地揭露出右派分子预期的阴谋。只有这样，才能在“疾风”中显出“劲草”来。
    痛心的而又使人愤怒的，是右派分子在文艺界放火的行动，已经具体地伸入我们的中国京剧院，15日报端揭露的事实，有目共睹。这种毒辣的阴谋，很明白是要摧毁我们的戏曲事业，把那些在解放后受到党的教育而逐步提高的演员，拉回旧社会去，达到他那妄想资本主义复辟的幻梦！朋友们！谁没有一颗心？谁没有一颗良心！我们仔细的想一想：在过去我们艺人过的是什么生活？在旧社会里是什么地位？虽然我们在演剧技能上，有些成就，而旧社会里那些豺狼鬼怪，是怎样的看待你？前尘不远，旧梦犹温，抚今追昔，能不凛然！所谓谈虎色变，痛定思痛，我们应当有明确的认识了。以我个人来说：不错，李少春三个字，过去是有些人知道的。但是李少春所以叫人知道，那只是为了生活“吃饭”。就是单纯的一个吃饭问题，也并不那样简单。为了赡养一家几十人吃饱了肚子，不论在什么环境，也要上台。记得有一个夏天，我贴了“打金砖”，忽然我得了霍乱，上吐下泻，急诊之下，勉强好了。可是我不能不演，主要倒不是戏院不同意，而是我为了吃饭，等米下锅，不可能不带病上场。像这样的事，我想同行们都会有此同感吧！解放后的今天，这样的事绝对没有了。党对我们的爱护，真是无微不至。在生活上照顾我们，在地位上推崇我们，在艺术上策进我们，在事业上鼓励我们。我们过的是幸福生活，真正的追求艺术，几年来，我们在国内国外的地位，真是“百尺竿头，指日而上”。但凡一个有良心的人，怎能不亲亲切切爱护我们的党；敬爱我们的党的领导；诚诚恳恳的保卫我们的党的领导呢？最近，我嗓子闹了点毛病，组织上不但替我介绍医院去检查诊治，还叫我多多休养，在休养期间，给我安排了适当的学习机会。我想：不止对我一人如此，对待同志们都是如此。党的领导真是伟大的！温暖的！铁一般的事实在此，有什么理由，能够灭却良心，不辨是非的向党诬蔑呢？但是，现在就有些人，已然接近了右派分子的边缘，公然给右派分子作了些事，这怎能不使人愤怒！非常的愤怒呢！
    毕竟党是英明的！人民的眼睛是雪亮的！看得出来：你们虽然接近了右派分子的边缘，而实际上是被拉拢的，利用的。你们应当感激党，感激人民，从泥潭里援以仁慈之手！我想：凡是一个有良心的人，都应当感念及此，立刻回头，真正的站稳立场，划清界限，尽量的揭露出右派分子鄙卑龌龊的阴谋。
