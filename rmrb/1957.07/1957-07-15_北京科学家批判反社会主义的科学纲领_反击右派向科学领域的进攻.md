Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a symposium today in Beijing, attended by over a hundred scientists, to criticize the anti-socialist scientific program proposed by bourgeois rightists and to counterattack the rightists' attack on socialism and the leadership of the Party.

The symposium was chaired by President Guo Moruo and Vice President Wu Youxun in the morning and afternoon, respectively.

Guo Moruo said at the meeting that the "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System" put forward by the Provisional Research Group on "Scientific Planning Issues" of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League was a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program. When this program was published in Guangming Daily, which was then controlled by Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping, Guangming Daily also published a commentary stating that it "opened up a new path for mutual supervision," proving that the Zhang-Luo alliance attached great importance to it. Guo Moruo questioned Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, asking what their intentions were, as members of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to be so concerned that the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences would fall into a state of anarchy. He called on scientists to take this matter seriously, stand firm, actively participate in the struggle to counterattack the rightists, and learn from it, absorb lessons, and conduct collective self-education.

Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang confessed at the meeting to the general process of drafting the China Democratic League's opinion paper.

Zeng Zhaolun admitted that he suggested at the China Democratic League's working conference at the end of March and early April that the China Democratic League convene people from the cultural, educational, and scientific fields to study the scientific system and the education system. He said that because Qian Weichang was working on part of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission, he had asked Qian to "get a feel" for the scientific system issue in the Scientific Planning Commission. Zeng Zhaolun said that the reason he was so enthusiastic about initiating discussions on the scientific system issue was mainly to allow the China Democratic League to "take the lead" and that "the idea of competing with the Communist Party" was at play. His idea of competing with the party re-emerged after the 20th Congress of the CPSU and after the Party put forward the policies of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

Qian Weichang confessed that he had attended a meeting convened by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League for members of the League attending the Chinese Academy of Sciences academic division meeting on May 14th. At that time, the meeting was divided into two groups, and he participated in the engineering, mathematics, physics, and chemistry group and spoke at the group meeting. Qian Weichang did not mention the specific content of this meeting. Qian Weichang also said that the third plan on scientific system issues proposed at the temporary research group meeting on June 5th was different from the second plan and added the issues of data and "returning to the ranks." He said that Zeng Zhaolun said at the time that these two issues were very important for social sciences.

Qian Weichang said that his mistake was mainly due to "personal ambition." For more than a decade, he had planned to build a university of science and technology in China like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, a school that would "play a leading role in all aspects," and a school that would "focus on scientific research and supplement it with teaching." Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, he came up with a plan that was in opposition to the Party's policy of adjusting departments and faculties in institutions of higher learning at the time. He said: "I used the blooming and contending to agitate everywhere and carried out activities to merge science and engineering schools among students." He said that he attempted to use the power of the China Democratic League to achieve his goal of seizing leadership of the school. On the issue of scientific planning, Qian Weichang said that he "wanted to be a double-dealer." For personal ambition, he did not agree to concentrate scientific research in the Academy of Sciences, but he lied in the Scientific Planning Commission, only saying that the Ministry of Higher Education did not pay attention to scientific research.

Qian Jiaju questioned Zeng Zhaolun in his speech about whether there were ulterior motives for engaging in the scientific system issue. He said that the China Democratic League's "Scientific Planning Issues" temporary research group was part of the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy. However, he, Tong Dizhou, and Hua Luogeng were not clear about how this group was formed. Zeng Zhaolun usually did not manage the work of the China Democratic League much, but he was very enthusiastic about this matter. He said that the drafter of the "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System" proposed by this group was Wu Chunxuan, a staff member of the China Democratic League. Qian Jiaju asked: Under whose instructions did he draft it? Qian Jiaju read a letter from Wu Chunxuan to the rectification office of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League at the meeting. This letter revealed and confessed the circumstances of drafting the opinion paper and the activities of the China Democratic League's "Scientific Planning Issues" temporary research group. The letter said that the wording of "protecting scientists" in the opinion paper was proposed by Qian Weichang, and Qian wanted to put this issue first. Qian also suggested at a symposium of scientists among NPC deputies and CPPCC members invited by the Bureau of Experts that the Bureau of Experts should draw up a "protection list." The letter said that the issue of cultivating new forces should be "treated equally." Fei Xiaotong said that he was "speaking for the young people." Fei's draft was: "In the past, there was a one-sided emphasis on political conditions in enrollment, promotion, selection of graduate students, and students studying abroad. We believe that this should be corrected in the future. There should be no privileges in opportunities for cultivation within the people..." Later, Zeng Zhaolun revised it to "People should be treated equally in opportunities for cultivation within the people."

Li Da pointed out at the meeting: In the China Democratic League's opinion paper, "the issue of social sciences" is the most important part. Social sciences are the sciences with the strongest class nature and party spirit. The common point of the old sociology, political science, economics, and law that the bourgeois rightists attempted to restore is that they are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist. They are using bourgeois social sciences to compete with Marxism-Leninism for leadership. They are using bourgeois social sciences as weapons to attack Marxism-Leninism on the one hand and attempting to abolish the Party committee system in schools and seize leadership in scientific and artistic work on the other hand. Can we tolerate this?

At the meeting, scientists were dissatisfied with Zeng Zhaolun's and Qian Weichang's confessions and sternly refuted their anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and activities. Wang Yanan said at the meeting that the country is currently in a period of socialist construction, and it is strange that a scientific program that does not mention the leadership of the Party or Marxism-Leninism would appear. This program is in fact anti-Party and anti-Marxist-Leninist and is part of the right-wing group's conspiracy. Wang Yanan analyzed the characteristics of Chinese intellectuals and explained the necessity of intellectuals' transformation.

In his speech today, Tong Dizhou talked about his participation in the China Democratic League's "Scientific Planning Issues" temporary research group and then said that the previous period's debate on the system between institutions of higher learning and research institutions of the Academy of Sciences caused great ideological confusion in the scientific and higher education circles. Is it man-made, is it natural, or is there a conspiracy? It is worth noting.

Hua Luogeng said at the meeting: My sense of smell is very bad. I made a mistake and let the people down. I must take it as a lesson and work hard to study Marxism-Leninism in the future, stand firm, and distinguish right from wrong. He also used his personal experience to explain that with the leadership of the Party today, the working conditions of scientists have improved countless times compared to before liberation, and the rightists have proposed the slogan of "protecting scientists," which is a slanderous accusation.

Mao Yisheng, Du Guoxiang, He Zuolin, and other scientists also criticized the anti-socialist scientific program at today's symposium.

The symposium is scheduled to continue on the 16th.

    北京科学家批判反社会主义的科学纲领
    反击右派向科学领域的进攻
    新华社14日讯　中国科学院今天召集在北京的科学家一百多人举行座谈会，批判资产阶级右派分子提出的反社会主义的科学纲领，反击右派分子向社会主义向党的领导的进攻。
    座谈会上下午分别由郭沫若院长和吴有训副院长主持。
    郭沫若在会上说，民盟中央
  “科学规划问题”临时研究组提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，是一个彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的科学纲领。这个纲领在当时章伯钧、储安平控制下的光明日报发表时，光明日报还发表了一篇评论，认为是“为互相监督开辟了新路”，证明章罗联盟十分重视。郭沫若质问曾昭抡、钱伟长说，你们身为科学院学部委员，唯恐中国科学院工作不陷于无政府状态，是何居心？他号召科学家严肃对待这件大事，站稳立场，积极参加反击右派的斗争，并从中得到锻炼，吸收教训，进行集体的自我教育。
    曾昭抡、钱伟长在会上交代了起草民盟意见书的一般过程。
    曾昭抡承认他是在3月底4月初民盟工作会议上建议民盟召集文教科学界人士研究科学体制问题和学制问题的。他说，因为钱伟长在国务院科学规划委员会担任一部分工作，他曾经要钱在科学规划委员会对科学体制问题“摸摸底”。曾昭抡说，他为什么一再热心发起对于科学体制问题的讨论呢？主要是想让民盟“抢先一步走”，是“与共产党分庭抗礼”的思想在作怪。他的分庭抗礼的思想是在苏共二十次代表大会以后，以及党提出“长期共存、互相监督”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策以后重新抬头的。
    钱伟长交代了他曾经在5月14日参加过一次民盟中央召集出席中国科学院学部会议的盟员举行的会议。当时分两个小组开会，他参加的是工程数理化小组，并在小组会上发了言。钱伟长没有谈到这次会议的具体内容。钱伟长还说，在6月5日的临时研究组会议上提出的有关科学体制问题的第三个方案同第二个方案不同了，增加了资料问题和“归队”问题。他说，曾昭抡在当时说这两个问题对于社会科学很重要。
    钱伟长说，他的错误主要是出于“个人野心”，他十几年来打算在中国办一所像美国马萨诸塞理工学院一样的理工大学，这所学校“在各方面都起领导作用”，这个学校“以科学研究为主，教学为辅”。他在“三反”以前搞了一个方案，同当时党的高等学校院系调整方针闹对立。他说：“我利用鸣放，四处煽动，在同学中进行了理工合校的活动。”他说，他企图利用民盟的力量来达到他的夺取学校领导权的目的。在科学规划问题上，钱伟长说，他是“要两面派”。为了个人野心，他不同意把科学研究集中到科学院去，但他在科学规划委员会说了谎话，只说高等教育部不重视科学研究。
    千家驹在发言中质问曾昭抡搞科学体制问题是否有不可告人的动机。他说，民盟“科学规划问题”临时研究组是章罗联盟阴谋的一部分。但是怎么成立这小组的，他和童第周、华罗庚三人是不清楚的。曾昭抡平时对民盟的工作管得并不多，但是对这件事却非常热心。他说，这个小组提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”的起草者是民盟的一个工作人员吴春选，千家驹问：他是在什么人的指示下起草的？千家驹在会上念了吴春选给民盟中央整风办公室的一封信，这封信中揭发交代了草拟意见书的情况以及民盟“科学规划问题”临时研究组的活动经过。信中说：意见书中“保护科学家”的提法是钱伟长提出的，而且钱要把这个问题列在首位。钱在一次专家局邀请人大代表、政协委员中的科学家座谈时，还提出希望专家局拟订一个“保护名单”。信中说，关于培养新生力量应“一视同仁”的问题的提出，费孝通说是“替年青人讲几句话”。费起草的语句是：“过去在升学、升级、选拔研究生、留学生时有片面强调政治条件的偏向，我们认为今后应当注意纠正。人民内部在培养机会上不应有任何特权……”后来，曾昭抡把他修改为“人民内部在培养机会上应一视同仁”。
    李达在会上指出：民盟中央的意见书中，“关于社会科学的问题”是最重要的一部分，社会科学是阶级性党性最强的科学，资产阶级右派分子企图恢复的旧社会学、政治学、经济学、法律学的共同之点，就是反共反人民反社会主义。他们是用资产阶级社会科学来同马克思列宁主义争夺领导权。他们一方面用资产阶级社会科学作武器向马克思列宁主义进攻，一方面企图在学校取消党委制，在科学、文艺工作中争夺领导权，这难道是我们所能容许的吗？
    会上，科学家们对曾昭抡、钱伟长的交代感到不满，并对他们的反党反社会主义的言论和活动进行了严正的驳斥。王亚南在会上说，目前国家正处在社会主义建设时期，居然会出现一个没有提到党的领导、没有提到马克思列宁主义字样的科学纲领，这是令人奇怪的事情。这个纲领事实上是反党反马克思列宁主义的，是右派集团阴谋的一部分。王亚南分析了中国知识分子的特点，说明知识分子进行改造的必要。
    童第周在今天的发言中谈到他参与民盟“科学规划问题”临时研究组的经过以后说，前一个时期，高等学校和科学院的研究机构关于体制的争论，在科学界和高等教育界造成很大的思想混乱，是人为的，是自然存在的，还是有阴谋活动？值得注意。
    华罗庚在会上说：我嗅觉十分不灵，犯了错误，对不起人民，要作为教训，今后下功夫学习马克思列宁主义，站稳立场，明辨是非。他并从他的亲身经历说明今天有了党的领导，科学家的工作条件，比解放前不知要提高了多少倍，而右派分子竟提出要“保护科学家”的口号，是一种血口喷人的诬蔑。
    茅以升、杜国庠、何作霖等科学家在今天的座谈会上也对反社会主义的科学纲领进行了批判。
    座谈会定16日继续举行。
