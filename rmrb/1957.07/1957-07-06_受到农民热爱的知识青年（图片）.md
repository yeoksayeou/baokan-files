    Long Wanshun, a young intellectual (junior high school graduate) from Fengtai Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, has been participating in agricultural production for three years. After three years of agricultural labor and training, he is now capable of handling any farm work, and often organizes everyone to learn new knowledge and promote new technologies. This year, he was selected as a representative to attend the Hebei Provincial Congress of Knowledgeable Youth Activists for Building a Socialist New Countryside.
