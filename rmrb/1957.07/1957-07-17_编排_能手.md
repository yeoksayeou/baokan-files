    "Expert" at Layout
  　Guo Min
    Gu Zhizhong said that news editing has no class character, but the fact is definitely not so. Chu Anping was an "expert" skilled in using the political nature of layout to capture readers. During the Liberation War, the "Observer" magazine edited by Chu Anping strongly demonstrated this. In recent days, the poor layout of the "Guangming Daily" under his control is even more self-evident.
    In the "Observer" magazine, Vol. 3, No. 18, published on December 27, 1947, two "reader letters" were published under the general title "Whipped from the Left and Beaten from the Right." The first letter quoted a dispatch from the Hong Kong "Hua Shang Bao," saying that the left wing whipped it, and the second quoted an essay from the Nanjing "Central Weekly," saying that the right wing beat it. The editor added this concise four-character Song typeface title to these two letters and published them, intending to show that this magazine was neither left nor right, fair and impartial. This is a means of attracting readers. Chu Anping wanted to use this to arouse readers' sympathy, making people feel that Chu Anping and his ilk were being whipped from the left and right because of their impartiality.
    However, what were the facts? Chu Anping only pushed the Kuomintang lightly while kicking the Communist Party heavily, seemingly impartial.
    This can be verified by magazines. We only need to flip through the "Observer" to see a large number of anti-communist remarks by Zhang Dongsun and his ilk, right?
    Chu Anping's "Whipped from the Left and Beaten from the Right" title is politically strong, skillfully handled, and vicious, demonstrating a deep understanding of the essence of political editing.

    编排“能手”
  　郭敏
    顾执中说，新闻的编辑没有阶级性，事实当然决非如此。储安平就是一位擅于运用编排的政治性来俘虏读者的“能手”。在解放战争时期储安平主编的“观察”就曾强烈的表现出来。前些日子在他掌握下的“光明日报”版面编排的恶劣自更不必说了。
    1947年12月27日出版第3卷第18期的“观察”上发表了两封“读者投书”，总标题是“左鞭右打”，第一封引用了香港“华商报”的通讯，说左派鞭它，第二封引用了南京“中央周刊”的论文，说右派打它。编者给这两封信加上这么一个寥寥四个仿宋体的标题登出来，其意在于显出这本杂志的不左不右，公正无偏。这正是一种拉拢读者的手段。储安平想借此引起读者的同情，使人感觉到储安平之流因为公正而遭到左右的鞭打。
    然而事实是怎样呢，储安平只是貌似公正地对国民党轻轻地推一把，对共产党重重地踢一脚。
    这是有杂志可查的，我们只要翻一翻“观察”不是就可以看到大量张东荪之流的反共言论吗？
    储安平的“左鞭右打”的标题的政治性之强，手法之巧妙、毒辣，可谓深明编辑政治性之三昧矣。
