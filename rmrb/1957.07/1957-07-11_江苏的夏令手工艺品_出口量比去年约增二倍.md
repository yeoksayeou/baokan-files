    Jiangsu's Summer Handicrafts
    Exports Increase Approximately Twofold Compared to Last Year
    With the arrival of summer, Jiangsu's Jiading yellow grass woven products and Suzhou sandalwood fans are selling well in the international market.

    Yellow grass woven products, especially grass handbags, are lightweight and durable, and have always been popular with overseas Chinese housewives. Currently, 120,000 of them have met consumers in markets in Southeast Asian countries such as Burma and Indonesia. Grass slippers produced in Jiading County are also very popular in the Southeast Asian market, with 180,000 pairs currently shipped to these countries. The planned export volume of these two commodities this year will exceed twice the export volume of last year. Suzhou sandalwood fans, whose ribs have a natural fragrance and can relieve sweat stains, have shipped 120,000 units, with a full-year export plan of 350,000 units, 110,000 more than last year, mainly sold to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries. According to foreign trade contracts, the volume of Changshu lace sold to capitalist countries such as Britain and West Germany this year will be equal to one and a half times the actual sales volume of last year.

    The quality, specifications, and variety of colors and designs of Jiangsu's export commodities this year are also more in line with the needs of foreign consumers. The variety of handicrafts and industrial art products exported from the province has increased from more than 80 last year to more than 150, and the planned total export value is more than 60% higher than last year. ·Xinhua News Agency·

    江苏的夏令手工艺品
    出口量比去年约增二倍
    盛夏来临，江苏嘉定黄草织品、苏州檀香扇等已在国际市场畅销。
    黄草织品草提包轻便、耐用，历来受华侨家庭主妇欢迎。现在已有十二万只在缅甸、印度尼西亚等东南亚国家市场上和消费者见面。嘉定县出产的草拖鞋在东南亚国家市场上也很行销，目前运到这些国家的有十八万双。这两种商品今年计划出口量超过去年出口量的两倍。扇骨上有天然香味，能解除汗污的苏州檀香扇运出了十二万把，全年外销计划三十五万把，比去年多十一万把，主要销苏联和东欧人民民主国家。按照对外贸易合约，今年售给英国、西德等资本主义国家的常熟花边，将等于去年实销量的一倍半。
    江苏今年出口商品质量、规格和花色品种也更合乎国外消费者需要。全省出口手工艺品和手工业品品种由去年的八十多种增加到一百五十多种，计划出口总值比去年多60％以上。　　　·新华社·
