    We fully agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at this meeting.
    We are here to talk about our experiences in studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" regarding the need to strengthen ideological and political work among intellectuals and young students.
    In order to better lead the people of the whole country in socialist transformation and socialist construction, the Party began a rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism nationwide in late April, to improve the Party's Marxist ideological level and improve its work style. This rectification movement of the Party has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people across the country who love the Party and love socialism, and they are willing to help the Party rectify its work style and help the Party improve its shortcomings and mistakes. Therefore, when Party organizations in various places called on non-Party members to offer suggestions to the Party, the vast majority of the masses, in the spirit of caring for the Party, offered many criticisms and opinions to the best of their knowledge, even though some were one-sided or incorrect, they were still sincere.
    Only by thoroughly defeating the political conspiracy of the rightists can we guarantee our socialist cause
    However, in this serious rectification movement, a perverse trend emerged. A small handful of bourgeois rightists, standing on the anti-Party and anti-socialist position, thought they had an opportunity to take advantage of, and vainly tried to fish in troubled waters, usurp the leadership of the Party, and take the capitalist road. From Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi in the central government to rightists in various localities, they spread fallacies, reversed black and white, confused right and wrong, exaggerated shortcomings, negated achievements, and frantically attacked the Party. In the past seven or eight years, under the wise leadership of the Party, China's socialist transformation and socialist construction have developed rapidly, and the achievements are brilliant, which is obvious to all. The rightists, standing on the reactionary position, insisted on closing their eyes and talking nonsense, saying that "shortcomings are the main thing." The socialist road was won by the people of the whole country through decades of bloody struggle under the leadership of the Party, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we be guided to take the correct socialist road. However, the rightists openly or covertly spread absurd remarks, not wanting the leadership of the Party, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship, and opposing socialism. In the name of helping the Party rectify its work style, they actually vainly tried to bring down the Party. This is resolutely not allowed by the broad masses of people who support the Party and support socialism. We must give these reactionary, anti-Party, and anti-socialist rightists a merciless blow, thoroughly smash their erroneous remarks, and defeat their political conspiracy. Only in this way can we guarantee our socialist cause. This is the unanimous demand of our broad masses of people. This is a complex class struggle on the political front and the ideological front. Through this struggle against the rightists, the broad masses of people, especially intellectuals and young students, have received a profound education and training in class struggle.
    The struggle against the rightists is a test of our class stand for intellectuals
    We are both educators in institutions of higher learning. In this movement, institutions of higher learning are the most active places for rightists, and also the market where anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks are most widely sold, and therefore also the place where the struggle is the most acute. This movement is a test of the class stand for our intellectuals and young students, and it also gave us a very practical and vivid political lesson.
    In this movement in institutions of higher learning, the rightists' conspiracy activities are extremely vicious, exaggerating and distorting the shortcomings of individual Party members as much as possible, even fabricating things out of thin air, negating the advantages, as if the vast majority of Party members are a mess, not as good as non-Party members. The leadership of the Party organizations in the schools is also useless, and it seems that the Party's leadership in the schools in recent years has not made any achievements, at least the shortcomings are the main thing. The rightists' position is clear, they want to oppose socialism and take the capitalist road. They are also very clear that to oppose socialism, they must oppose the leadership of the Party. Therefore, the rightists in institutions of higher learning, in coordination with the nationwide rightists' frantic attack on the Party, tried their best to attack the prestige of Party members in the schools, vainly trying to abolish the Party's leadership in the schools.
    In institutions of higher learning, the rightists, whether among faculty and staff or among young students, are in the extreme minority. How can they stir up big waves?
    The vast majority of our intellectuals and young students support the Party and support socialism. However, in this storm, some people could not withstand the test, were blurred by the hidden or distorted remarks of the rightists, echoed them, could not stand firm, could not distinguish between right and wrong, and even a very small number completely stood on the anti-Party and anti-socialist position, and a very small number of Communist Youth League members also did not stand firm. This is how the rightists caused considerable chaos in institutions of higher learning in this movement in a short period.
    For example, the issue of the Party committee system in institutions of higher learning is originally to implement the Party's leadership system in institutions of higher learning, it is the system of Party committee leadership with division of labor and responsibility, it is the division of labor between the Party and the government. From our Southwest Normal College, Sichuan University, and from the several institutions of higher learning that we have more contact with, such as Chongqing University, Southwest Agricultural College, Sichuan Medical College, and Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering, we have not felt that the Party is replacing the government, and the non-Party leaders of these schools do not have positions without power. Now the leadership in the schools, just like other units, is to have collective leadership, and no leader is allowed to act arbitrarily. Non-Party leaders cannot do this, and Party leaders cannot do this either. If a leader thinks that he has no power because he cannot act arbitrarily, that is a wrong idea. If a leader wants to lead the school to take the anti-socialist road, of course he cannot be given this power. The rightists attacked the implementation of the Party committee system in schools, saying that this system will inevitably produce Party replacing the government, non-Party leaders will inevitably have positions without power, and it is also said that the active role of veteran teachers cannot be brought into play, and therefore they put forward such things as "professors running the school" and "the school affairs committee leading the school." From our personal experience, the Party committee system in schools does not have these insurmountable shortcomings in the system itself, but rather the shortcomings of the Party committee leadership in individual schools. The rightists' argument is essentially to abolish the Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning. However, these hidden and distorted fallacies have a certain market among intellectuals and young students, and they are also echoed by some people who usually support the Party and support socialism.
    In this movement in institutions of higher learning, there are many fallacies that are essentially anti-Party and anti-socialist, but they do not openly shout anti-Party and anti-socialist, which often makes some people confused. For example, a student severely criticized those openly anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks in the student forum, but he could not distinguish the reactionary nature of the "Party's world" fallacy at that time. From this, it can be seen that our solemn refutation of the rightists' fallacies is very necessary.
    Strengthening ideological and political work for youth is a key issue in institutions of higher learning at present
    We have studied Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." In the speech, it is pointed out that "In intellectuals and young students, ideological and political work has been weakened in recent times, and some deviations have occurred." "In view of this situation, it is now necessary to strengthen ideological and political work." From this movement, we further realize that Chairman Mao's instruction is a key issue in our institutions of higher learning at present.
    In the past seven or eight years since liberation, our intellectuals have indeed made considerable progress under the education of the Party, and the vast majority support the Party and support socialism. However, recently there has been some complacency, and our own progress has been overestimated, thinking that ideological transformation is almost complete, and non-political tendencies are developing.
    Ideological and political work for young students has also not been grasped tightly recently, and non-political tendencies are also developing. A considerable number of students only value their professional courses, and do not value political courses and necessary social activities. In higher normal schools, there is also a tendency to despise education subjects. Regarding the work assignment of graduates and the selection of students to study abroad, treating political conditions as one of the review conditions is also considered to be the Party's sectarianism, which is incorrect, and this is also a manifestation of non-political tendencies.
    Young students are less infected by the old society, relatively simple, easy to accept the truth, and easy to progress. But it is also because they are simple, have little social experience, and the vast majority have neither been tempered by revolutionary struggle nor experienced the dark life under the rule of the reactionary regime. The flowers cultivated in the greenhouse are very fragile and cannot withstand storms. At present, most of the students in institutions of higher learning are from families of the exploiting classes, and are easily influenced by bourgeois ideology. In addition, in recent years, institutions of higher learning have relaxed ideological and political work for students. This has made some young students blurred by the reactionary fallacies of the bourgeois rightists in this movement and lost their direction. In the recent struggle against the rightists, the vast majority of confused students have awakened and resolutely drawn a clear line between themselves and the rightists. This struggle has tempered the broad masses of young students in a complex class struggle and given them a vaccination.
    We must learn from the workers and peasants their firm stand in the face of great storms
    The talents we train in institutions of higher learning must be suitable for the needs of socialist construction, and they must also be talents who are loyal to socialism, wholeheartedly serve the people, and master highly scientific and cultural knowledge. This struggle has sounded a loud alarm for our higher education workers and young students. If we do not strengthen ideological and political work, from the perspective of loyalty to socialism, a considerable number of students are substandard, and a very small number are waste products. Should this not arouse deep vigilance among our educators and young students?
    From this movement, we should see that the reactionary remarks of the rightists only have the widest market among our intellectuals. In this great storm, the position of many intellectuals is wavering. Because we still have more or less bourgeois ideological consciousness, and many are not firmly standing on the socialist position. Some may be supporting socialism because it is the general trend, and they still have some taste for the bourgeois arguments of the rightists, and they still resonate in our minds, so it is easy to leave the socialist position and be captured by the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the rightists. Can we still say that our ideological transformation is almost complete? Can we still be complacent? We really cannot. We must continue to earnestly transform ourselves. "Educators must be educated." We must strengthen our study of Marxism, study current affairs and politics, and "gradually integrate with the workers and peasants" and learn from them. In this movement, I occasionally talked to the bricklayers working in the school. They were very angry at the anti-Party and anti-socialist blackboards and big-character posters that the rightists stirred up in the school. They scolded these students for eating the people's food and doing things against the people. We intellectuals should not think that we have more scientific and cultural knowledge than workers and peasants, and look down on them. In the face of great storms, we are often not as firm as they are. There are too many examples of this. "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." If we do not strengthen our transformation, we will not be able to fulfill the glorious task of human soul engineers, and it will be impossible for us to train qualified socialist construction talents for our country.

### 必须对青年加强思想政治工作  谢立惠、柯召的联合发言

专栏：

    必须对青年加强思想政治工作
    谢立惠、柯召的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长在这次会议上所作的报告。
    我们在这里是要谈谈在学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中知识分子和青年学生需要加强思想政治工作的体会。
    党为着更好地领导全国人民进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，四月底在全国范围内开始进行反官僚主义、反宗派主义、反主观主义的整风运动，来提高全党的马克思主义思想水平，改进作风。党的这次整风运动，是全国热爱党、热爱社会主义的广大人民群众所热烈欢迎的，愿意帮助党整风，帮助党改进缺点和错误。所以在各地党组织号召党外人士给党提意见时，广大群众大多数本着爱护党的精神，知无不言、言无不尽地提出许多批评和意见，尽管有一些是片面的或不正确的，却还是诚恳的。
    要彻底打垮右派的政治阴谋才能保障我们的社会主义事业
    但是就在这严肃的整风运动中，出现了一股歪风。那些站在反党反社会主义立场上的一小撮资产阶级右派分子，以为有机可乘，妄想混水摸鱼，篡夺党的领导权，走资本主义道路。从中央到地方，从章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等到各地的右派分子，大放谬论，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，夸大缺点，否定成绩，疯狂地向党进攻。七八年来在党的英明领导下，我国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设是飞跃发展的，成绩是辉煌的，这是人所共见的。站在反动立场上的右派分子，他们偏要闭着眼睛瞎说，“缺点是主要的”。社会主义道路是全国人民几十年来在党的领导下用血肉斗争换来的，亦只有在共产党领导下，才能引导我们走正确的社会主义道路。右派分子却公开的或隐蔽的散布荒谬言论，不要党的领导，反对人民民主专政，反对社会主义。借帮助党整风之名，实际上是妄想把党整垮。这是全国拥护党、拥护社会主义的广大人民所坚决不允许的。我们必须给这些反动的反党反社会主义的右派分子以无情的打击，彻底粉碎他们的错误言论，打垮他们的政治阴谋，只有这样才能保障我们的社会主义事业，这是我们广大人民一致的要求。这是一场复杂的政治战线上和思想战线上的阶级斗争。通过这次反击右派分子的斗争，亦使广大人民，特别是知识分子和青年学生，受到了一场深刻的阶级斗争教育和锻炼。
    反右派斗争是一次对我们知识分子阶级立场的考验
    我们都是高等学校教育工作者。在这次运动中，高等学校是右派分子最活跃的地方，亦是反党反社会主义言论销路最广泛的市场，因而亦是斗争最尖锐的场所。这次运动是对我们知识分子和青年学生一次阶级立场的考验，亦使我们上了一堂极实际的生动的政治课。
    高等学校在这次运动中，右派分子阴谋活动是极恶毒的，尽可能夸大歪曲个别党员的一些缺点，甚至于无中生有，否定优点，好像党员绝大多数都是一团糟，都不如非党员好。学校党组织的领导亦是一无是处，几年来党在学校中的领导，好像毫无成绩，至少缺点是主要的。右派分子的立场是明确的，他们就是要反对社会主义，要走资本主义道路。他们亦非常明了，要反对社会主义，必须反对党的领导。因此在高等学校的右派分子，配合全国右派分子向党的猖狂进攻，极力打击学校中党员的威信，妄想取消党在学校的领导。
    在高等学校的右派分子，无论在教职员中、在青年学生中，都是极少数，他们怎样能掀起大波大浪呢？
    我们知识分子和青年学生绝大多数是拥护党、拥护社会主义的。不过在这次风波中，却有部分人经不起考验，被右派分子隐蔽的或歪曲的言论所模糊，随声附和，站不稳立场，分不清是非，甚至有极少数是完全站在反党反社会主义立场上，极少数的共青团员亦没有站稳立场。这样才使右派分子在高等学校的这次运动中造成短时期相当大的混乱。
    例如高等学校党委制问题，这本是贯彻党在高等学校的领导制度，是党委领导分工负责制，是党政分工的。从我们所在的西南师范学院、四川大学，从我们所接触较多的几个高等学校如重庆大学、西南农学院、四川医学院、重庆建筑工程学院等，都未感觉到是以党代政，这些学校的非党员领导人，亦不是有职无权。现在学校里的领导，正像其他单位一样，就是要集体领导，任何领导人不允许独断独行，非党员领导人不能这样做，党员领导人亦不能这样做。如果领导人因为不能独断独行就意味着无权，那是错误的想法。如果领导人要想领导学校走反社会主义道路，当然不能让他有这种权。右派分子攻击学校实行党委制，说这种制度必定产生以党代政，非党员领导人必定有职无权，并且说亦不能发挥老教师的积极作用，因而提出什么“教授治校”，“校务委员会领导学校”等。从我们的切身体会，学校党委制，并不从制度本身存在这些不可克服的缺点，而是个别学校党委领导的缺点。右派分子这种论调，实质上是要在高等学校取消党的领导。但是他们这些隐蔽的歪曲的谬论，在知识分子和青年学生中就有一定的市场，并且还得到部分平时是拥护党、拥护社会主义的人的附和。
    在高等学校这次运动中，有很多的实质上是反党反社会主义的谬论，但是未公开喊出反党反社会主义，常使得一部分人受到迷惑。例如有一个学生在学生论坛上严厉地批驳那些公开反党反社会主义言论，但是他当时却不能辨别“党天下”谬论的反动性。由此可见我们对于右派分子谬论的严正驳斥是非常必要的。
    加强对青年的思想政治工作是目前高等学校一个关键问题
    我们学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，在讲演里指出“在知识分子和青年学生中，最近一个时期，思想政治工作减弱了，出现了一些偏向”。“针对着这种情况，现在需要加强思想政治工作”。我们从这次运动中，进一步体会毛主席这个指示，是目前在我们高等学校中一个关键问题。
    解放后七八年来，我们知识分子在党的教育下，的确有相当大的进步，绝大多数是拥护党、拥护社会主义的。但是最近一个时期有些自满情绪，对我们自己的进步有些估计过高，以为思想改造差不多了，非政治倾向在发展。
    对青年学生的思想政治工作最近亦抓得不紧，非政治倾向亦在发展。相当多的学生只重视专业课，不重视政治课和必要的社会活动。在高等师范学校里还出现轻视教育学科的偏向。对毕业生工作分配和选派留学生等，把政治条件当作审查条件之一，亦认为是党的宗派主义，这是不正确的，这亦是非政治倾向的一种表现。
    青年学生受旧社会的感染少，比较单纯，容易接受真理，容易进步。但亦就因为他们单纯，社会经验少，绝大多数既未受到革命斗争的锻炼，又没有在反动政权统治下黑暗生活的体验，在温室里培养出来的花朵，非常脆弱，经不起风波。现在高等学校的学生，还大多数出身于剥削阶级家庭，容易受资产阶级思想意识的影响。加之近年来高等学校，对学生的思想政治工作又放松了。这样就使得在这次运动中。部分青年学生被资产阶级右派分子的反动谬论所模糊，迷失方向。在最近反右派分子斗争中，绝大多数被迷惑的学生觉醒了，坚决同右派分子划清界限。这次斗争使广大青年学生受到一次复杂的阶级斗争的锻炼，打了一次防疫针。
    要学习工人农民在大风浪中的坚定的立场
    我们高等学校培养出来的人才，是要适合于社会主义建设的需要，亦就必需是忠诚于社会主义的、全心全意为人民服务的、掌握有高度科学文化知识的人才。这次斗争对我们高等教育工作者和青年学生都敲了响亮的警钟。假如不加强思想政治工作，从忠诚于社会主义的要求来衡量，有相当一部分学生是次品，还有极小部分是废品，这在我们教育工作者和青年学生还不要引起深刻的警惕吗。
    从这次运动中，我们应当看到右派分子的反动言论只有在我们知识分子中有最广泛的市场。在这次大风波中，有不少知识分子的立场是摇摆的。因为我们还存在着或多或少的资产阶级思想意识，还有不少不是坚定的站在社会主义立场，有些在拥护社会主义，可能还是大势所趋，对右派分子的资产阶级论调，还有些合口味，还在我们思想中起共鸣，亦就容易离开社会主义立场而被右派分子的反党反社会主义言论所俘虏。对我们的思想改造，还能说差不多吗？还能自满吗？实在不能。我们必须继续认真地改造自己。“教育者必需受教育。”我们必需加强学习马克思主义，学习时事政治，要“逐步地同工人农民打成一片”，向他们学习。在这次运动中，曾偶尔同在学校里工作的瓦工谈心，他们对右派分子在学校里煽动起来的那些反党反社会主义的黑板报大字报非常愤恨，他们骂这些学生吃人民的饭，干反人民的事。我们知识分子不要以为我们比工人农民多有些科学文化知识，了不起，轻视他们。在大风浪中，我们常不如他们立场坚定，这种例子太多了。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。我们不加强改造自己，就不能胜任人类灵魂工程师的光荣任务，亦就不可能为我们国家培养出合格的社会主义建设人才。
