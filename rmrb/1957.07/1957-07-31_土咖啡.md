    "Earthen Coffee"
    The Taizhou Flour Mill in Jiangsu Province originally provided workers in the workshop with a refreshing drink – "earthen soda." Later, due to the shortage of citric acid, one of the raw materials, they could no longer produce it. The workers suggested using the roasted barley tea that is commonly drunk in the countryside during summer as a substitute. This method is very simple: after sifting the barley clean, roast it in a pot over a moderate heat until it is charred, then sift it again. After it cools, wrap it in gauze and soak it in boiling water (to prevent any remaining awns). One and a half jin of charred barley can be used to brew six dan of boiling water. Then add an appropriate amount of saccharin, and it can be drunk after it cools (hot or cold). The workers love it and call it "earthen coffee."

    土咖啡
    江苏省泰州面粉厂原来供给车间工人一种清凉饮料——土汽水，后因内中原料之一柠檬酸脱销，无法再制，工人们便建议用农村夏天饮用的焦大麦茶代替。这个方法很简单：将大麦筛净后，在锅内用匀火炒焦，再筛一次，等冷后，用纱布包好泡开水
  （防止有少数麦芒），一斤半焦大麦可泡六担开水，再加适量糖精，等冷后即可饮用（冷热均可）。工人们很爱吃，称它是“土咖啡”。
