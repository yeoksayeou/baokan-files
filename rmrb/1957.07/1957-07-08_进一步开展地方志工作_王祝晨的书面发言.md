    Further Develop Local Gazetteers Work
    Wang Zhuchen's Written Statement
    Last June, at the Third Plenary Session of this committee, I proposed "Starting Early to Edit Local Gazetteers," which aroused enthusiastic responses across the country. Major newspapers and periodicals in Beijing and Shanghai successively published several papers on local gazetteer issues in response. Some provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and even Xiamen City, have already started work separately.

    Our Shandong established the "Shandong Provincial Local Gazetteers Material Collection Committee" in February 1957 and began collecting provincial gazetteer materials. In the past few months, it has received enthusiastic support from the masses inside and outside the province, and has received more than one hundred submissions in various styles, totaling more than 200,000 words. At the same time, some veteran revolutionary comrades have put forward many specific and valuable opinions on how to compile a good Shandong Provincial Local Gazetteer. On May 24 this year, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued a notice to the People's Committees of all special districts, cities, and counties in our province, all departments directly under the province, democratic parties, and people's organizations, requesting all counties to establish collection groups to widely carry out the work. It was also decided to publish an internal publication "Shandong Provincial Gazetteer Materials" as a tool for soliciting public opinions, publishing exemplary manuscripts, guiding work, exchanging experiences, and promoting this work. We hope that this preliminary experience will receive the support and assistance of gentlemen across the country who are concerned about local gazetteer issues.

    In March this year, at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meeting, Mr. Shen Zhaonian of the Hubei Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History introduced the situation of local gazetteer work in Hubei Province at the conference. Mr. Gu Jiegang, Mr. Li Peiji, and Mr. Ye Gongchuo jointly proposed eight implementation guidelines on the issue of continuing to compile local gazetteers, and we fully agree with them. In order to carry out the publicity and preparation work on local gazetteer issues throughout Shandong Province, Vice Governor Yu Xiu published a call on April 1st in the "Dazhong Daily" entitled "Why Conduct Local Gazetteer Material Collection Work," and I also published a short article entitled "Preliminary Methods for Editing Shandong Local Gazetteers." In order to draw everyone's attention throughout the province, we compiled the literature materials on local gazetteer issues published in major newspapers and periodicals across the country since last year into a "Collection of Local Gazetteer Papers," which was distributed to the participants at the Third Plenary Session of the Shandong Provincial CPPCC and the Provincial Archives Work Conference, and recently distributed to relevant departments in various cities and counties for everyone to study and reference.

    Now I would like to put forward several suggestions on further developing local gazetteer work:

    First, a national leading body should be established to be responsible for guiding and planning this long-term and arduous scientific research work. It would be best if relevant departments centered on the Chinese Academy of Sciences could undertake this glorious task. Because the first of their basic tasks is to "face the whole country and strengthen academic leadership." Moreover, they have the most specific scientific research materials and various specialized talents, which can reduce the duplication and waste of human and material resources, deepen the connection between scientific research work and the masses, and also do a good job in academic exchanges and communication between the central government and local areas.

    Second, relevant departments of the Central People's Government should convene a national "Local Gazetteers Work Conference" in a timely manner, in order to uniformly plan specific programs for further developing local gazetteer work nationwide.

    Third, local gazetteer work is an important part of China's ongoing communist cultural construction, and this work should be formally included in the national basic construction plan and budget. I think that all provinces and cities can establish specialized working bodies. All regions with comprehensive universities or teachers colleges can appropriately absorb and mobilize their strength to participate in this work. For example, the teachers and students of the geography, history, biology, and Chinese departments of Shandong Normal College are willing to cooperate with us to respectively undertake the writing of "Shandong Geography Gazetteer," "Shandong Biology Gazetteer," and the modern revolutionary history of Shandong. Shandong University and Qingdao City are also actively participating in this work. In the local areas, elderly intellectuals, teachers and students of secondary schools, and primary school teachers can also be fully mobilized to participate in this extremely broad mass work.

    Fourth, local gazetteers include two parts: history and geography. In my speech "Start Early to Edit Local Gazetteers," I said: "It is extremely necessary to edit local geography today, but the central government has more materials, so it should be edited by the central government." That was because the Ministry of Internal Affairs replied to my opinion in the Inner Household Group (54) No. 569 letter in November 1954, mentioning "confidentiality," so I said that. Nearly three years have passed, and local geography has not yet been published. The Ministry of Education is calling on normal colleges in various provinces to undertake this work. However, when normal colleges solicit materials from various departments, they are still rejected by various departments on the grounds of "confidentiality." Shandong was investigated extremely thoroughly by Germany, especially Japan. We do not know how many books and newspapers they published and secret materials they preserved. We hope that the central government will determine the standards and scope of confidentiality as soon as possible to ensure the smooth progress of scientific research work. Otherwise, the editing of local geography will be impossible to complete. Primary and secondary school textbooks should have nationally unified textbooks, and should also have local special textbooks (including language, history, geography, and others). The former should be compiled by the central government, and the latter should be compiled by the local governments, on the one hand to cultivate a sense of love for the hometown and the country, and on the other hand to cultivate knowledge and skills to adapt to the environment. If local textbooks cannot be compiled in various places, it cannot be regarded as a major defect in education. This is something that the central government should pay attention to.

    进一步开展地方志工作
    王祝晨的书面发言
    去年六月我在本会第三次全体会议上提出“早早动手编辑地方志”的倡议，曾引起全国各地的热烈反应。北京、上海的各大报刊先后发表了若干有关地方志问题的论文加以响应。有些省份如湖南、湖北、陕西、山西、云南、四川乃至厦门市等处，业已分别着手进行中。
    我们山东已于一九五七年二月成立了“山东省地方志资料集征委员会”，开始进行省志资料的征集工作。数月以来得到省内省外广大群众的热情支持，并已收到各种体裁的来稿一百多件，共计有二十多万字。同时有些老革命同志，对于如何编好山东省地方志问题，提出许多具体而宝贵的意见。山东省人民委员会已在今年五月二十四日向我省各专署、市、县人民委员会，省直各部门，民主党派，人民团体发出了关于进行地方志资料的通知，要求各县建立征集组，广泛地展开工作。并决定编印一种内部刊物“山东省志资料”，作为征询群众意见，发表示范性文稿，指导工作交流经验和推动这一工作的工具。我们这一项初步经验希望得到全国各地关心地方志问题先生们的支持和援助。
    今年三月全国政协开会时，湖北省文史馆的沈肇年先生在大会上介绍了湖北省方志工作的情况。顾颉刚、李培基、叶恭绰三位先生又就继续编纂地方志问题，联合提出八项实行纲要，我们完全同意。为了在山东全省范围内展开地方志问题的宣传酝酿工作，余修副省长本年四月一日在“大众日报”上发表了“为什么要进行地方志资料征集工作”的号召，我又发表了“编辑山东地方志的初步办法”的短文。为了在全省范围内引起大家的重视起见，并把去年以来全国各大报刊所发表的有关地方志问题的文献材料，编印成“地方志论文集”一种，在山东省政协第三次全体会议及全省档案工作会议上发给与会人员，最近又发到各市、县有关部门，供大家学习参考。
    现在我想就进一步开展地方志工作，提出几项建议：
    第一，要设立一个全国性的领导机构，负责指导规划这一长期的、艰巨的科学研究工作。最好能以中国科学院为中心的有关部门承担这一光荣的任务。因为他们的基本任务中第一条就是“面向全国，加强学术领导”。而且他们掌握了最具体的科学研究材料和各种专门人材，既可减少人力物力的重复浪费，又可把科学研究工作深入地联系群众，还可以作好中央与地方在学术工作上的交流与沟通。
    第二，中央人民政府有关部门应该及时地召开一次全国性的“地方志工作会议”，以便统一规划出如何进一步在全国范围内，展开地方志工作的具体方案。
    第三，地方志工作是我国正在进行的共产主义文化建设的一个重要组成部分，这一项工作应该正式列入国家基本建设的计划与预算之内。我以为各省市都可以成立专门性的工作机构。凡设有综合性大学或有师范学院的地区，都可以适当地吸收并动员他们的力量参加这一工作。像山东师范学院的地理、历史、生物、中文各系的师生们，就都愿意和我们合作分别承担“山东地理志”、“山东生物志”和山东近代革命历史的撰写工作。山东大学和青岛市同样积极参加这一工作。在地方上也可以充分地动员老年知识分子、中等学校的师生和小学教师们参加到这一具有极其广泛的群众性工作中来。
    第四，地方志包括历史和地理两部分，我在“早早动手编辑地方志”的发言中曾说：“在今日编辑地方地理，极为需要，但中央掌握材料较多，应由中央编辑。”那是，因为一九五四年十一月内务部内户群（54）字第伍陆玖号函复我的意见中提到“保密性质”，我才那样说的。距今将近三年，地方地理仍未出书，教育部乃号召各省师范学院担任这一工作。惟师范学院向各部门征集材料时，仍被各部门以“保密性质”拒绝供给。山东经德国尤其日本调查的极其详细，由它们发表了的书报和保藏起来的秘密资料不知多少。我们盼望中央早日确定保密的标准与范围，保证科学研究工作的顺利进行，否则地方地理的编辑，将无法完成。中小学教材应有全国统一的教材，亦应有地方特殊的教材（包括语文史地及其他）。前者应由中央主编，后者应由地方自编，一方面培养爱乡爱国的心理，一方面培养适应环境的知识技能。如各地方乡土教材无法编辑，在教育上不能不算一大缺陷。这是中央应该加以注意的。
