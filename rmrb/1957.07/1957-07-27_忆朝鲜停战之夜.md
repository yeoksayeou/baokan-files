    Remembering the Night of the Korean Armistice
    Xia Mansu

    Four years ago today was an extraordinary day. At that time, I was a volunteer soldier, guarding the front line of the Imjin River in Korea. Around six o'clock in the afternoon, the order to cease fire from zero hour on this night was transmitted from the division headquarters. This delightful news immediately spread throughout the position. Everyone said, "The Korean people can now live a peaceful life!" "This is good news for peace-loving people all over the world!" Little Devil Wang Linsen proudly pointed to their榴弹炮 (I have no idea how to translate this) gun, which had collectively been awarded a third-class merit, and said, "You won't be reasonable until you're beaten! The enemy is afraid of this guy!" His Hunan dialect made everyone laugh. I seemed to see the land I was standing on, scorched by the flames of war, beginning to sprout new green seedlings. In factories, in the fields, people were freely engaged in peaceful labor, mothers were peacefully feeding the children in their arms, students were carrying their schoolbags, happily walking towards school... a scene of joy.

    The sacred moment of zero hour was approaching, but the enemy did not relax its destruction of the people's lives and property in the slightest. The roar of airplanes never stopped for a second – it had never been so crazy in the past, and they had never dared to be, probably taking advantage of this "loophole". In the dark night sky, incendiary bombs, heavy bombs, machine-gun strafing... and the flames from various shells fired from the enemy's front-line positions, rose and fell one after another. The only remaining dilapidated thatched shed of Grandpa Jin near our station was also subjected to the poison of the American aggressors, falling into the raging flames. Innocent people were being killed and wounded again, and we really couldn't bear it any longer. Comrades all jumped into the fortifications, and the flames of revenge burned in our hearts. We were all silently chanting: Send down the order quickly, and beat them hard!

    The order finally came down, boom boom boom! ... Our dense and fierce artillery fire was like thousands of fire dragons, accurately flying towards the enemy's position. The enemy's position immediately became a sea of fire, and the enemy's artillery fire was suppressed. The anti-aircraft guns of the neighboring units also launched an air battle, densely packed sparks surrounded the enemy planes, chasing the enemy planes, and the enemy planes fled in panic. The position began to calm down.

    I looked at the watch on my hand from time to time, hoping that the time would come quickly. However, in the distance, the enemy planes' bombing had not completely stopped. Thatched sheds, small bridges, farmland, road intersections... all became their targets.

    Did the enemy think peace was terrible? "Yes, we love peace, but they are so hostile to peace and keen on war!" I wrote these words in a small notebook in my arms at the time.

    Four years have passed in the blink of an eye. Over the past four years, the people of North Korea have been building their homes in tense and joyful ways. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement, and have made many major efforts to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, for four years, the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique have continuously undermined the Armistice Agreement, especially recently, the American aggressors have unilaterally cancelled the main clauses of the Armistice Agreement and transported a batch of new weapons into South Korea. The American aggressors have also openly announced that they will transport various weapons, including those with atomic warheads, into South Korea. Everyone understands that this is the American aggressors' attempt to turn Korea into an atomic base, further threatening peace in Asia and the world. This is a very despicable conspiracy! We are watching closely. We want to warn the American aggressors that the people of the world want peace, and whoever dares to launch a war will be burned by the flames of war!

    忆朝鲜停战之夜
    夏曼苏
    四年前的今天，是一个不平凡的日子。那时，我是一个志愿军战士，守卫在朝鲜的临津江前线。下午六点钟光景，从师部传来了今夜二十四时零分起开始停战的命令。这个令人愉快的消息，立刻在阵地上传开了。大家纷纷说，“朝鲜人民从此可以过和平的生活了！”“这是全世界爱好和平人民的喜讯呵！”小鬼王林森骄傲地指着他们那门集体立过三等功的榴弹炮说：“不打不识相！敌人是怕这个家伙呀！”他满口湘西土话，把大伙都逗笑了。我仿佛看到自己脚下踏着的被战火灼伤了的土地，又开始生出新绿的嫩苗来。工厂里，田野上，人们在自由地进行着和平的劳动，母亲们在安详地喂着怀抱中的孩子，学生们提着书包，愉快地走向学校……一片欢乐的景象。
    二十四时零分这个神圣的时刻快要到了，可是敌人一丝也不放松对人民生命财产的毁灭。飞机的轰隆声，一秒钟也没有停止——过去从来没有、也从来不敢这样疯狂的，大约是瞅了我们这个“空子”吧。黑越越的夜空里，烧夷弹、重磅炸弹、机枪扫射……还有从敌人前沿阵地发射过来的各种炮弹所迸射出的火光，此起彼落。我们驻地附近仅存的金老大爷的那间破茅棚，也遭到美国侵略者的毒手，落在熊熊的火光里了。无辜的人民又在遭受杀伤，我们实在无法忍耐了。同志们都跳进了工事，复仇的火焰在我们心里燃烧。我们都在默默的叨念：快下命令，狠狠的揍呀！
    命令终于下来了，通通通通！……我们密集而猛烈的炮火，像千百条火龙。准确地飞向敌人的阵地。敌人的阵地立刻成为一片火海，敌人的炮火被压制住了。友邻部队的高射炮，也展开了对空战，密密麻麻的火星包围着敌机，追赶着敌机，敌机仓皇逃遁。阵地开始平静下来。
    我不时地望着手上的表，希望时间快点到来。然而在远处，敌机的轰炸还没有完全停止。茅棚、小桥、庄稼地、公路交叉口……都成了它们袭击的目标。
    敌人认为和平是可怕的吗？“是的，我们热爱和平，它们却这样敌视和平，热中于战争！”当时我在怀里的一个小本上写了这些话。
    转眼又四年了。四年来，北朝鲜的人民在紧张而愉快地建设着自己的家园。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军严格地遵守着停战协定，并且为了促成朝鲜问题的和平解决，作了许多重大的努力。可是，四年以来美国侵略者和李承晚集团不断破坏停战协定，特别是最近美国侵略者竟片面取消停战协定的主要条款，把一批新型的武器运进了南朝鲜。美国侵略者还公开宣布要把包括装有原子弹头的各种武器运进南朝鲜。谁都明白，这是美国侵略者要把朝鲜变成原子基地，进一步威胁亚洲和世界和平。这是一个十分卑劣的阴谋！我们密切地注视着。我们要警告美国侵略者，全世界人民要和平，谁敢发动战争，谁就要被战火烧毁！
