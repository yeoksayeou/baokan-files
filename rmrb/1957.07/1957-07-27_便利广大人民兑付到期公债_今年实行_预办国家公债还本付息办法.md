To Facilitate the Vast People to Cash Expired Government Bonds
This Year Implement the "Pre-Handling Method for National Government Bond Principal and Interest Payment"

    (Our Newspaper) Since the founding of the country, the state has successively issued five tranches of national bonds. Each tranche stipulates that starting one year after issuance, a portion of the principal will be repaid annually by lottery, and all due interest will be paid. Adopting this form of interest-bearing government bonds and the method of repaying principal and interest once a year has played a significant role in eliminating the adverse effects of old government bonds left over from the old society by the people, and in establishing and consolidating the credit of new government bonds. However, due to the annual issuance of government bonds, the number of tranches for repaying principal and interest each year and the amount of money involved have increased. According to the repayment pattern of the past few years, the amount of repayment within ten days from September 30th to October 10th accounts for more than 70% of the total amount due for the entire period, and even more than 80% in some large cities. This has resulted in a high concentration of government bond tranches, repayment dates, and repayment amounts, as well as a high degree of pressure on bank operations. At the same time, the vast people are dissatisfied with the queuing and crowding to cash government bond principal and interest.
    In order to improve the current queuing and crowding situation for government bond principal and interest payment, the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China have formulated the "Pre-Handling Method for National Government Bond Principal and Interest Payment." The main approach of this method is: two months before the government bond principal and interest payment, the bank will widely use social forces to entrust agencies, troops, enterprises, organizations, schools, and credit cooperatives to handle the matter on their behalf; scattered and large numbers of bonds will be concentrated as much as possible through various units on a voluntary basis by the bondholders, and the procedures for accepting and inspecting winning bonds and cutting due interest coupons will be completed in advance before payment. Then, the bank will take the method of making appointments for dates and paying in batches, according to the order of pre-handling, 15 days in advance (that is, starting from September 15th). The advantages are: the payment date and amount can be actively arranged to make it balanced and prevent excessive concentration; government bond holders can cash out according to the appointment date, eliminating the queuing and crowding phenomenon. Although the repayment date is earlier than originally stipulated, the pre-handling procedures allow for planned and step-by-step arrangement of government bond principal and interest repayment work within a certain period of time, which has no impact on the entire national fiscal budget.

    便利广大人民兑付到期公债
    今年实行“预办国家公债还本付息办法”
    本报讯　建国以来，国家已陆续发行了五期全国性公债，每期公债都规定于发行后一年起，逐年按比例抽签偿还一部分本金并付给全部到期利息。采取这种有息公债形式和每年还本付息一次的办法，对消除人民从旧社会遗留过来对旧公债的不良影响，树立与巩固新公债的信誉起了很大作用。但由于逐年发行公债，每年还本付息的期次和金额也就愈大。根据几年来的兑付规律，在9月30日到10月10日的十天内，兑付金额占全期应兑总数70％以上，个别大城市甚至达到80％以上。这就形成了公债期次、兑付日期与兑付量的高度集中以及银行工作的高度突击，同时广大人民对兑付公债本息的排队拥挤现象也是不满意的。
    为了改进目前公债还本付息的排队拥挤情况，财政部和人民银行制定了“预办国家公债还本付息办法”。这个办法的主要做法是：在公债还本付息两个月前，由银行广泛运用社会力量，委托机关、部队、企业、团体、学校及信用合作社等单位代办；将分散的、大量的债券，在公债持有人自愿的基础上，尽可能通过各单位集中起来，在兑付前预先办妥验收中签债券及裁剪到期息票的手续，然后，由银行根据预办先后次序，提前于十五天内（即9月15日开始兑付）采取预约日期、分批兑付的办法。它的好处是：可以将兑付日期和数量主动安排，使之均衡，防止过度集中；公债持有人可以按照预约日期兑取，消除排队拥挤现象。虽然兑付日期较原规定提前，但由于经过预办手续，可以有计划、有步骤的在一定时间内安排公债还本付息工作，对整个国家财政预算并无影响。
