Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 28th: The socialist education movement is being widely unfolded in Changzhi, Yuci and southern Shanxi areas, and is currently gradually penetrating into remote mountain villages. Party secretaries of the Communist Party in various regions are personally leading this movement, and have dispatched a large number of responsible cadres to go deep into the countryside to assist in the work.

In this movement, the rural areas of Shanxi generally linked to practical situations and discussed major issues such as whether or not the Communist Party's leadership is needed, whether or not the people's democratic dictatorship is needed, whether socialism is good, and whether the lives of peasants have improved. Many rural areas put up fresh blackboards and agitation posters that gave affirmative answers to these questions. Similar debates also unfolded in rural reading groups and clubs. Elderly farmers who had not paid much attention to national affairs in the past also took the stage to give speeches, using their personal experiences to educate young people to distinguish right from wrong, and explaining that peasants had been liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party, and that socialism is the road supported by the peasants. Many cadres and peasants who originally had incorrect understandings of the Communist Party and the country also took the initiative to examine their thinking and draw clear class lines.

This movement began in June of this year. In Pingshun, Jincheng, Licheng, Qin County and other places, the peasants first rose up to counterattack the bourgeois rightists. In Jincheng County, more than 300,000 peasants universally compared the old and new societies in the struggle, and compiled many vivid and lively facts into clappers and doggerels as a powerful basis for refuting the rightists and educating themselves.

In the southern and central Shanxi plains, peasants in various counties have also successively joined the struggle.

    晋中南农民的斗争讲坛
    读报组  俱乐部  黑板报  鼓动牌
    新华社太原28日电　社会主义教育运动，在长治、榆次和晋南地区广泛展开，目前正在逐步深入到偏僻山庄。中共各地党委书记亲自领导这个运动，并且派出大批负责干部，深入农村协助工作。
    山西各地农村在这个运动中，一般都联系实际讨论了要不要共产党领导，要不要人民民主专政，社会主义好不好，农民生活有没有改善等重大问题。许多农村挂出内容新鲜的黑板报、鼓动牌，对这些问题作了肯定的回答。在农村读报组和俱乐部里，也展开同样的辩论。过去不多过问国家大事的老年农民，这次也登台演讲，以亲身经历教育青年明辨是非，说明农民是在共产党领导下翻身的，社会主义是农民拥护的道路。许多原来对共产党对国家有错误认识的干部和农民，这次也主动地检查思想，划清阶级界限。
    这个运动是从今年6月开始的。在平顺、晋城、黎城、沁县等地，农民们首先起来回击资产阶级右派分子。晋城县有三十多万农民在斗争中，普遍作了新旧社会的对比，并且把许多鲜明生动的事实对比，编成快板和顺口溜，作为驳斥右派，教育自己的有力根据。
    在晋南、晋中平原，各县农民也相继投入斗争。
