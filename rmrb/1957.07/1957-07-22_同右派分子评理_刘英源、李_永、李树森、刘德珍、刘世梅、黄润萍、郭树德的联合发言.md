We fully agree with and enthusiastically support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

After listening to the reports, we are very happy and pleased. From the reports, we learned that the country's construction in all aspects is advancing rapidly, the people's living standards are steadily rising, and the future of socialism is bright. At the same time, the reports correctly estimate the shortcomings and difficulties in our work, point out the goals for our efforts, and instead of making us blindly optimistic, increase our confidence and courage, and strengthen our sense of responsibility.

On the other hand, we also noticed the conspiracies of the rightists. They want to overthrow the people's democratic regime and restore capitalist society. They want to set fire to our happy home so that they can loot while we are distracted and drag us back to the dark ages of the past. This audacious and shameless behavior fills us with indignation. We want to warn the rightists that the new China is the revolutionary achievement created by the countless blood and sweat of our workers and peasants. Anyone who wants to destroy it or devour it, we, the 600 million people of the country, will raise our hammers and wave our hoes and beat them until their heads are covered in blood.

Our Achievements Must Not Be Erased

We are all workers. Let's talk about production first. In terms of railway transportation, in the twenty-two years of the Kuomintang era, only 2,600 kilometers of railways were built throughout the country. In the short eight years since liberation, more than 8,500 kilometers have been built. The movie "Moving Mountains and Filling the Sea" that the delegates watched this time is part of the arduous project of the Yingxia Railway. There are many mountains and rivers here, and the terrain is dangerous. In order to shorten the route, we blasted away some mountain peaks and filled several miles of sea bay to pave the Yingxia Road. Such a project is rare even in industrialized capitalist countries, let alone in the Kuomintang era.

Representative Li Yong, an old worker who has worked on the railway for more than 40 years, had never seen a Chinese-made locomotive before liberation. In the short period after liberation, there was a self-made 1-5-1 type locomotive. This type of locomotive has a much higher traction speed than the old locomotives. The traction tonnage can reach more than 3,000 tons. People cherished the forty-year-old wish for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This time the Chengdu-Chongqing Road was opened to traffic. Some people personally touched the rails and listened to the sound of the train whistle, and were so moved that they couldn't speak. The slope of the Qinling section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was too steep. In the past, engineers from capitalist countries said that a railway could not be built, but now we have built it.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the workers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. Some have overfulfilled their tasks, and some have created new records. For example, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot where Representative Guo Shude is located, the traction tonnage of the locomotives in the depot was 1,800 tons in 1949, and it has reached 2,700 tons in 1956. Most of the locomotives have safely traveled hundreds of thousands of kilometers. Among them, one locomotive team has not had any accidents in the past ten years. Their safe driving has been nearly one million kilometers, and they have also saved coal and materials. In order to care for the workers, the government also invests in transforming old locomotives and parts to reduce the workers' physical labor, such as changing the MK locomotive to a coal grinder, automatic oiling, etc. Compared with 1949, the output of locomotive repairs and steel castings in the Changxindian Locomotive Repair Factory where Representative Li Shusen is located has increased three times. Not only has the quantity increased greatly, but the quality has also been greatly improved. For example, the mileage of overhaul locomotives in the past was 300,000 kilometers. Due to the improvement of quality and the maintenance of the crew, it has now been increased to 500,000 kilometers.

The Beijing Repair Factory of the Ministry of Electric Power where Representative Liu Yingyuan is located, fully completed its production tasks for the first time in 1956. The total annual output value was originally planned to be 8,744,400 yuan, and the task was completed by 113.4%; the commodity output value was originally planned to be 8,784,400 yuan, and the task was completed by 119.2%; the labor productivity was originally planned to be 8 million yuan, and the task was completed by 115.8%; the profit turned over to the state was originally planned to be 253,000 yuan, and the task was completed by 360%.

The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory where Representative Huang Runping is located was just a repair shop with less than 100 people before liberation. After liberation, it was transformed into a factory manufacturing agricultural tools. It started to manufacture small agricultural tools such as horse-drawn plows and weeding hoes. Later, it produced rocker harvesters. Since this year, it has learned to manufacture new Soviet agricultural tools, the Stalin No. 6 combine harvester, which is suitable for large-scale cultivated land in Northeast and North China. More than 100 units have now been manufactured. In these short few years, we have developed from a simple repair shop with less than 100 people into an agricultural machinery factory with more than 1,500 people that can produce complex large-scale machinery! Is this change a small matter!

The Xi'an High-Pressure and High-Temperature Thermal Power Plant where Representative Liu Dezhen is located will be put into trial operation on August 1st this year. The difficulty of this plant is that there is no foundation, and the staff has no basic construction experience. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the brave enthusiasm of the workers, everyone is united from top to bottom, and everyone is conscientiously learning technology and studying business with the determination to overcome difficulties. As a result, the national standards were finally achieved, the plan was completed, and more than 2 million yuan of funds were saved for the country in the increase in production and conservation. The Qinghe Woolen Mill where Representative Liu Shimei is located was a very small factory before liberation and could only produce one product. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, a worsted spinning mill was expanded in 1951, and a plush mill was expanded in 1954. Now, not only can it produce a variety of products, but it can also produce high-grade wool fabrics. The workers are actively trying to meet the needs of the people for the cause of socialist construction.

Fellow delegates: The rightists say that we only report good news and not bad news. We don't understand. The hard work of the working brothers and the successful undertakings for the benefit of the people are originally happy events for the country and the people. Why shouldn't we report them to the people of the motherland?

Under the correct leadership of the great Communist Party, we have done things that could not be done for a long time in the past in a short period of time. At the same time, we have saved funds and materials, the products meet standards and specifications, and we continue to improve quality and reduce costs. We have also cultivated a batch of valuable technical forces in our work, laying a solid foundation for the continued development of our undertakings. Why can't the rightists see all these good omens for building a family and starting a business? They are not ignorant children either. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi are all ministers, great intellectuals, and senior national cadres. Why do they lie against their conscience? Why do they erase the achievements of our working class?

We Never Evade Shortcomings and Difficulties

Yes, we never deny that there are still many shortcomings and difficulties in our production that need to be improved and resolved. But this is different from what the rightists think. The rightists want to exaggerate our shortcomings, gloat over our misfortunes, and profit from them, so they always deliberately find fault. We believe that exposing shortcomings, overcoming difficulties, and resolving contradictions is the best way for us to make progress, so we do not avoid them. Our first shortcoming is that the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift has not been universally implemented. There are still phenomena of waste and backlog of manpower, funds, and materials. The approval and issuance of plans are slow, and construction often starts loosely and ends tightly. At the end of the year, construction is carried out in winter, and overtime work is done during surprise attacks, which affects quality. Also, some factories have too many non-production personnel, and the allocation of technical forces is not reasonable enough. Some units still have departmentalism. For example, some factories have excessive technical forces and are unwilling to support other factories, fearing that it will weaken their own strength. For example, in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, the newly built thermal power plant is short of coal and water. Farmers rely on water from the mountains to grow crops. The thermal power plant needs to sign a contract with the local area for water use. The water source must first meet the needs of farmers for watering the land, and then be supplied to the power plant. This creates many difficulties in the use of water sources for the power plant and also affects the development prospects of the plant. This is related to investigation and research and design. Piece-rate wages are good, but in the implementation, there are still shortcomings in pursuing quantity and neglecting quality.

In terms of the system, the following issues need to be researched and improved: production planning, wages and welfare, training and upgrading of apprentices, and how to strengthen the political and ideological education of employees, etc. Our work has difficulties and shortcomings, and perhaps more than these, but we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve victory, and not like the rightists say that we have no way. It is probably the rightists who really have no way. Confessing the conspiracy is dirty and smelly, and cannot be seen by people; it is despised by the people of the whole country and cannot be tolerated by social justice. Wearing a mask and playing rogue, under the demon mirror, the original shape is vividly revealed, and you cannot escape the eyes of the masses. What to do in the end? Let us all watch the rightists!

Our Lives Are Rising Day by Day

Now let's talk about our lives. We resolutely oppose the rightists' sowing discord and talking nonsense, saying that the lives of workers and peasants are bitter. Regarding the lives of farmers, many farmer representatives have already said that the lives of farmers are rising. Regarding workers, take the Shijingshan Power Plant as an example. During the period of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang, the workers worked all day long and were exhausted, but they still couldn't get enough to eat and couldn't support their wives and children. Representative Liu Dezhen, for example, started farming at the age of eight or nine and became a handyman at the age of thirteen. She was often hungry and skinny. After liberation, her life greatly improved. She had enough to eat and wear, and she grew up red and fat. Not only did she improve her education, but her children also went to middle school. Most workers in general factories have bought bicycles, radios, and sewing machines, and some have watches. Most workers eat rice and white flour. In terms of clothing, most people's clothes used to have patches, but now everyone has one or two sets of new clothes. Before liberation, the workers' children carried broken baskets to pick up coal, but now they are rarely seen. What we see now are mostly children with schoolbags on their backs! In the past, we workers were called "stinky workers," and laborers were regarded as inferior. Now labor has become a glorious title, the working class is the leading force, and workers are generally learning culture. In industrial and mining enterprises, many workers are doing leadership work. Factories that did not recruit female workers in the past now recruit many female workers. These changes are huge and fundamental. These changes are particularly profound and kind to us workers who have suffered. Especially the female workers, who suffered particularly heavy oppression in the old society, so they also resolutely oppose the rightists dragging the happy socialist life back into the capitalist quagmire. We deeply feel that such precious revolutionary achievements are hard-won. No matter who dares to destroy it even a little bit, we will use all our strength to protect it. The iron facts show that our lives are rising day by day. Of course, we are not saying that the lives of workers do not need to be improved further. We cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We will use more labor and wisdom to produce more and better things for the motherland, and further improve the living standards of the people throughout the country on the basis of improving production. At the same time, we will work harder to produce and build our motherland better to fight back against the attacks of the rightists.

Intelligence and Knowledge Cannot Be Separated from the Purpose of Serving the People

The rightists' lies have gone bankrupt, and the excuses used to attack the people's regime to restore capitalism have also collapsed. Judging from your attitude in confessing your problems these days, you are still blinded by blood and your ambitions are still unfulfilled. You still want to take the opportunity to get something out of it. We must take out the demon mirror to see how long your tails are. You think you are "great intellectuals," extremely clever, and think that the people are all fools, but why can't your conspiracy activities escape in front of fools? Where has your knowledge gone? Why did the fools uncover the evil lid of the clever people and reveal your true colors? You are wrong. Intelligence and knowledge cannot be separated from the purpose of serving the people. Once separated from this purpose, it has no value at all. To be honest, the masses are very clear about you. In the past, they did not settle accounts with you because of the working class's tolerance. You yourselves should also know how much debt you owe the people, and how much of it is blood debt. You, a small group of right-wing ambitious elements, when the counter-revolutionary forces were in power, you colluded with each other, some riding on the heads of the people, acting as bullies; when the revolution was in difficulty, you shook your heads and wagged your tails, gloating; when the revolution was approaching victory, you were opportunistic, straddling two boats; when the revolution succeeded, you pointed fingers and reaped the benefits. You are still not satisfied, and you are still hypocritical, wolf-hearted and dog-lunged, and you are planning to usurp the leadership of the working class all day long. We say that the right-wing ambitious elements are too overconfident. We can tell you: In Beijing's factories and workshops, workers are holding meetings every day. They are eager to roll up their sleeves and reason with you. They want you to go to the factories and workshops, to the mines and mine shafts, to the railway lines, and to the construction sites. There are thousands of workers there waiting for you in anger. They want to settle the general accounts with you to see who is right.

    同右派分子评理
    刘英源、李　永、李树森、刘德珍、刘世梅、黄润萍、郭树德的联合发言
    我们完全同意并热烈拥护周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。
    听了报告，我们非常高兴和愉快，从报告中了解到国家各方面的建设飞快前进，人民的生活稳步上升，社会主义的前途光芒万丈，同时也正确估计了工作中的缺点和困难，给我们指出了努力的目标，使我们不是盲目乐观，而是增加了信心和勇气，加强了自己的责任。
    另一方面，我们也注意到右派分子的阴谋，他们想推翻人民民主政权，恢复资本主义社会，他们想点火烧毁我们幸福的家园，以便趁火打劫，把我们拖回到过去黑暗的时代，这种大胆妄为，无耻勾当，使我们气愤填胸。我们要警告右派分子，新中国是我们工人和农民流了无数血汗创造出来的革命成果，谁要想破坏它，或者吃掉它，我们全国六亿人民会举起铁锤、扬起锄头，打得他头破血流。
    不允许抹杀我们的成绩
    我们都是工人，先说生产：在铁路交通方面，国民党时代的二十二年中，全国铁路仅仅修建了二千六百公里，解放后短短的八年内，已经修建了八千五百多公里。代表们这次看的“移山填海”的电影，就是鹰厦铁路艰巨工程的一部分。这里多山多水，地势险陡，为了缩短线路，我们炸毁了一部分山峰，填平了几华里海湾，使鹰厦路铺平起来，这样的工程，不用说国民党时代，就是在工业发达的资本主义国家里也是很少见的。
    在铁路上工作四十多年的老工人李永代表，在解放前，从来没有看见过中国自己制造的机车，解放后，短短时期就有了自制的1—5—1型机车，这种机车比旧机车牵引的速度高得多。牵引吨数可达三千多吨。人们对成渝铁路怀着四十年的愿望，这次成渝路通了车，有人亲自抚摸了铁轨，听了火车汽笛声，感动得话都说不出来了。宝成铁路秦岭一段坡度太陡，过去资本主义国家的工程师说：不能修火车道，而现在我们已修成了。
    在党和政府的正确领导下，工人的生产热情普遍高涨，有的超额完成任务，有的创造新纪录，例如郭树德代表所在的丰台机务段，该段机车牵引吨数，一九四九年的规定是一千八百吨，一九五六年已经达到二千七百吨，大部分机车都安全行走了几十万公里，其中有一个机车组十年来未出过责任事故，他们的安全行车，已经将近一百万公里，而且省煤、省材料。政府为了爱护工人，也投资改造旧的机车、机件，以减轻工人的体力劳动，例如冖ㄎㄧ型机车改为绞煤机，自动走油等。李树森代表所在的长辛店机车修理厂比起一九四九年来修理机车的产量和铸钢的产量都提高了三倍，不但数量有很大增加，而且，质量上也大大提高了，例如大修机车的走行公里，过去是三十万公里，由于质量的提高和乘务员的保养，现在已提高到五十万公里。
    刘英源代表所在的电力部北京修造厂一九五六年首次全面完成了生产任务。计：全年总产值原计划数是八百七十四万四千元，完成任务百分之一百一十三点四；商品产值原计划数八百七十八万四千元，完成任务百分之一百一十九点二；劳动生产率原计划八百万元，完成任务百分之一百一十五点八；上缴利润原计划二十五万三千元，完成任务百分之三百六十。
    黄润萍代表所在的北京农业机械厂，解放前只不过是一个不到一百人的修械所，解放后就改成制造农具的工厂，开始制造马拉犁、耘锄等小型农具，后来生产了摇背收割机；今年以来，学习制造苏联新式农具，适用于我国东北、华北等地大面积耕地的斯大林6号康拜因，现在已经造出了一百多部。在这短短的几年里，我们从一个不到一百人的简陋的修械所，发展成为一千五百多人的能生产复杂的大型机械的农业机械厂了！这个变化难道是小事情么！
    刘德珍代表所在的西安高压高温热电厂，今年八一就要试运行了，这个厂的困难是没有基础，工作人员没有基本建设经验，由于党的领导和职工群众的勇敢热情，上下团结一致，人人都兢兢业业的抱着克服困难的决心学技术，钻业务，结果终于达到了国家的标准，完成了计划，并在增产节约中为国家节约二百多万元的资金。刘世梅代表所在的清河制呢厂，在解放前是一个很小的工厂，只能生产一种产品。解放后，在党和政府的领导下，在一九五一年扩建了一个精纺厂，在一九五四年又扩建了一个长毛绒厂。现在不但能生产多种产品，而且也能生产高级的呢绒，工人们为了社会主义的建设事业，正在积极想办法来满足人民的需要。
    各位代表：右派分子说我们报喜不报忧，我们不明白，工人弟兄的辛勤创造，为人民谋福利的成功事业，本来是国家和人民的喜事，为什么不应该向祖国人民汇报呢？
    我们在伟大的共产党的正确领导下，短短期间做了过去长期做不到的事情，同时节约资金、材料，产品合乎标准、规格，还不断提高质量，降低成本，在工作中还培养了一批宝贵的技术力量，为继续发展事业，打下了有力的基础。这一切兴家立业的好气象，右派分子们为什么看不见呢？他们也不是不懂事的小孩子，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器都是部长，大知识分子，国家高级干部，为什么昧着良心说胡话呢？为什么抹煞我们工人阶级的成绩呢？
    我们从不回避缺点和困难
    是的，我们从来不否认在我们的生产中，还存在着不少的缺点和困难，极需改善和解决，但这和右派的想法不同，右派想夸大我们的缺点，幸灾乐祸，从中取利，所以总是故意找碴。而我们认为暴露缺点，克服困难，解决矛盾，是我们进步的最好方法，所以我们不躲避。我们的缺点首先是贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针还没有普遍做到，人力、资金、器材还有浪费、积压现象，计划批准下达迟缓，施工往往先松后紧，年终就冬季施工，突击就加班加点，这样又影响到质量。还有些厂非生产人员过多，技术力量配备还不够合理，有些单位还有本位主义，如有的厂技术力量过剩，不愿支援别厂，怕减弱自己的力量。又如陕西鄠县，新建的热电厂，在那里是缺煤、少水，农民种地靠山上下来的水，热电厂用水要与当地订合同，水源须先满足农民浇地的需要，其次才供电厂用，这就造成电厂水源使用上的很多困难，并对该厂发展前途也受到影响，这和调查研究、设计是有关系的。计件工资是好的，但在执行时，还有追求数量，忽视质量的缺点。
    在制度方面，极需研究和改善的有：关于生产计划问题、工资福利问题、学徒工培养升级的问题，以及如何加强对职工的政治思想教育等问题，等等。我们的工作是有困难和缺点的，也许还不止这些，但是我们一定能够克服困难，取得胜利。而不是像右派说的我们没办法。真正没有办法的，恐怕是右派，交代阴谋吧，又脏又臭，见不得人；为全国人民所不齿，为社会正义所不容。蒙着假面具，耍无赖吧，照妖镜下，活现原形，逃不脱群众的眼睛。倒底怎么办？让我们大家来看右派分子吧！
    我们的生活日益上升
    现在谈谈我们的生活。我们坚决反对右派分子挑拨离间，胡说八道，说什么工农生活苦。关于农民生活，许多农民代表已经说过了，农民弟兄的生活是上升的。关于工人，拿石景山发电厂来说，工人们在敌伪和国民党时期，一天到晚工作，累得够呛，还是吃不饱，养不活老婆孩子，像刘德珍代表，八、九岁就种地，十三岁当小工，常常挨饿，瘦得不像人样，解放后，生活大大改善，有吃有穿，长得又红又胖，不但自己提高了文化，子女也念上了中学。一般工厂里的工人，有的买了自行车，有的买了收音机，有的有了缝纫机，有的带上了手表。大部分工人吃上了大米白面。穿的方面过去多数人的衣服都有补钉，现在人人都有一、二套新衣了。解放前工人的孩子们背着拣煤核的破筐子，现在很少见了，而现在见到的，多是背上书包了！过去我们工人被叫做“臭工人”，劳动者被看作低人一等，现在劳动成了光荣的称号，工人阶级是领导力量，工人普遍的学文化，在工矿企业中，有很多工人作了领导工作。过去不招收女工的厂子，现在招收了很多女工。这些变化是巨大的，是带着根本性的，这些变化对于我们曾经受过痛苦的工人们，得到的感受特别深刻，特别亲切。尤其是女工们，在旧社会里受到的压迫特别重，因而她们也坚决反对右派分子把社会主义的幸福生活，再拖回到资本主义泥坑中去。我们深深感觉到这样宝贵的革命成果得来不易，无论谁，只要他胆敢有一点点破坏，我们就要用一切力量来保护它。铁的事实说明了我们的生活是日益上升的。自然，我们不是说工人的生活就不需要再提高了，我们还不能满足现状，我们将用更多的劳动和智慧为祖国生产更多更好的东西，在生产提高的基础上，进一步地提高全国人民的生活水平。同时我们更加努力生产，把祖国建设得更好，来回击右派分子的进攻。
    聪明和知识是离不开为人民服务的目的的
    右派分子们的谎言是破产了，用以攻击人民政权恢复资本主义的借口也垮台了。这几天从你们交代问题的态度来看，还是血迷心窍，野心不死，还想乘机捞一把，我们要拿出照妖镜来，照照你们的尾巴有多长。你们自以为是“大知识分子”，聪明绝顶，以为人民群众都是傻瓜，可是为什么你们这种阴谋活动在傻瓜面前逃不脱呢？你们的知识那里去了，傻瓜为什么会掀开了聪敏人罪恶的盖子，而且照出了你们的原形呢？你们错了，聪敏和知识是离不开为人民群众服务的目的的，一离开这个目的，就丝毫没有价值了。老实说，群众对你们很清楚，过去不和你们算账，是工人阶级的宽大，你们自己也应当知道，欠过人民的多少债，其中有多少是血债。你们这一小伙右派野心分子，当反革命势力当权的时候，你们勾勾搭搭，有的骑在人民头上，作威作福；当革命困难的时候，你们摇头摆尾，幸灾乐祸；当革命接近胜利的时候，你们投机取巧，脚踏两只船；当革命成功的时候，你们指手划脚，坐享其成。这样还不满足，还口是心非，狼心狗肺，整天策划着篡夺工人阶级的领导权，我们说右派野心分子也太不量力了，我们可以告诉你们：北京市各个工厂工段上每天都有工人们在开会，他们摩拳擦掌要和你们评评理，要你们到工厂和车间去，到矿山矿井里去，到铁道线路上去，到建筑工地上去，那里有数以千百计的职工在怒气冲天地等候着你们，他们要和你们算算总账，看看到底谁有理。
