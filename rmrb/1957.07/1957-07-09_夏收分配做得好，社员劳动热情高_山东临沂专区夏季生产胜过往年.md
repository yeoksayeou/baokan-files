Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 8th – The summer distribution and summer production of nearly ten thousand agricultural cooperatives in Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, are progressing very well.

The members of the agricultural cooperatives in Linyi Prefecture all praise this year's summer pre-distribution as both reasonable and timely. As early as March, the agricultural cooperatives began to formulate summer pre-distribution plans one after another. Due to the rectification of the communes in the spring, the concept of democratic commune management by the commune cadres has been greatly strengthened, and the phenomenon of a few commune cadres monopolizing the formulation of plans has been basically eliminated, so that opinions from commune members are widely solicited, and the plans are formulated reasonably. After the wheat matured, the agricultural cooperatives followed the principle of harvesting, threshing, and distributing simultaneously. Therefore, the order of summer harvest and distribution is particularly good. Now, only half a month has passed since the wheat was harvested, and the summer pre-distribution of the agricultural cooperatives in the entire prefecture has ended, generally more than half a month earlier than last year.

The bumper wheat harvest and the reasonable and timely summer pre-distribution have encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the commune members. Moreover, this year, 90% of the communes in the entire prefecture have promoted the contract labor system to the grassroots units and implemented appropriate decentralization of power between the commune and the team. Therefore, summer production is also better than in previous years. More than a thousand agricultural cooperatives in Rizhao County rationally allocated labor during the summer harvest, achieving the goal of harvesting one mu and planting one mu. When more than 400,000 mu of wheat fields were harvested, summer planting was also basically completed. Some time ago, this prefecture experienced drought, and the members of the agricultural cooperatives implemented drought resistance and rushed to plant. Zhulu District in Junan County used all water sources and water lifting tools to plant summer fields in a few days and also watered nearly 3,000 mu of corn. According to statistics from eight counties, in the past week, more than 120,000 mu of various crops have been watered and rushed to plant. The agricultural cooperatives in various places also accepted the lessons learned from the severe grass and weed infestation of last year's autumn harvest crops, and after the summer harvest, they drew a part of the labor force to carry out a concentrated summer hoeing campaign. Now, the first hoeing of more than five million mu of early autumn crops in the entire prefecture has been completed after the wheat harvest, and a total of four hoeings have been carried out including before the wheat, one more hoeing than last year. In several counties in the south where summer planting was earlier, half of the late autumn crops have also been hoeed once. Now, the autumn harvest crops in this prefecture are growing very well, and the members of the agricultural cooperatives are carrying out topdressing, pest control, and other activities, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn.

### 夏收分配做得好，社员劳动热情高  山东临沂专区夏季生产胜过往年

    夏收分配做得好，社员劳动热情高
    山东临沂专区夏季生产胜过往年
    新华社临沂8日电　山东省临沂专区近万个农业社的夏季分配和夏季生产搞得很好。
    临沂专区的农业社社员们都称赞今年的夏季预分是既合理，又及时。早在3月间，各农业社就陆续开始制定夏季预分方案。由于经过春季整社，社干部民主办社的观念大大加强，基本上消除了少数社干部包办制定方案的现象，做到了广泛征求社员意见，使方案订得合理。小麦成熟后，各农业社又随收、随打、随分。因此，夏收和分配的秩序特别好。现在，离小麦登场还只不过半个多月，全专区各农业社的夏季预分已经结束，普遍比去年提早了半个月以上。
    小麦丰收和夏季预分合理及时，鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。并且，今年全专区有90％的社把包工制推行到了基层单位和实行了社、队适当分权。因此，夏季生产也比往年好。日照县一千多个农业社在夏收中合理调配劳动力，做到收一亩、种一亩；等四十多万亩麦田收完，夏种也随着基本上完成了。前些时候，这个专区发生旱象，农业社社员们就实行抗旱抢种。莒南县朱芦区把所有水源和提水工具都利用起来，几天内就种完了夏田，还水浇了近三千亩玉米。据八个县的统计，在最近一周中，共浇水抢种各种作物十二万多亩。各地农业社还接受去年秋收作物草荒严重的教训，在夏收结束后就抽出一部分劳动力突击夏锄。现在全专区五百多万亩早秋作物已经锄完麦后第一遍地，连同麦前共锄了四遍，比去年多锄一遍。南部夏种较早的几个县，还已经有半数晚秋作物锄过一遍。现在，这个专区的秋收作物长得很好，农业社社员们正在开展追肥、除虫等活动，争取秋季全面丰收。
