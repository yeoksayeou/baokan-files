    Communist Youth League Members in the Wheat Harvest

    During the wheat harvest season, we came to the Red Star Collective Farm in the southern suburbs of Beijing. We heard many people praising the Communist Youth League members, so we conducted interviews about this.

    The youth production team, with the Communist Youth League members as its backbone, had already finished harvesting the wheat first. We asked the captain of the youth production team, "We heard that there are combine harvesters that can harvest for you. Why do you harvest it yourselves?" They said, "Using combine harvesters requires paying harvesting fees! Harvesting ourselves can save expenses." We then asked, "When harvesting yourselves, you could use sickles, why do you pull it by hand?" "Pulling it by hand can uproot the wheat, which can increase firewood." "Pulling, can your hands withstand it?" They said, "Of course, our hands can withstand it. Many people's hands are swollen, but we ultimately pulled all the wheat." The Party Branch Secretary added from the side: "After our Sihaizhuang Production Brigade started pulling wheat for a day, many people felt the task was arduous and were intimidated, suggesting using combine harvesters. But our youth production team insisted on pulling by hand. Other production teams were encouraged by their spirit of not fearing hardship and their remarkable results, and they also continued to pull by hand. The wheat pulling task was successfully completed. Although the youth production team has few people, the average area of wheat pulled per person is several acres more than that of other team members."

    One scorching morning, the Ruihezhuang Production Brigade was pulling wheat in a vast wheat field. The tide of people engulfed the wheat waves. Several vanguards appeared in the tide of people, the foremost being Zhao Shuying, a eighteen-year-old girl, a Communist Youth League member. The Communist Youth League members of Ruihezhuang are not only good at production, but especially cherish public property. A few days ago, it was discovered that the seven or eight thousand catties of wheat in the bags were heating up, with the risk of mold and rot, but the sky was still overcast and threatening rain, so we dared not spread it out to dry. The only way was to mix it with the wheat with chaff, allowing it to gradually cool down. The Communist Youth League members and youths took on this burden, working tirelessly, busy all night, mixing all the wheat well, and requesting that no work points be recorded.

    Not only in the above two villages, but the Communist Youth League members throughout the Red Star Collective Farm are outstanding in protecting public property and in production.

    At the third crowing of the rooster, the earth barely opened its sleepy eyes. At this time, there were shadows of people wriggling at the head of each village—the Communist Youth League members and villagers began to go to the fields to harvest wheat.

    During the day, except for butterflies leisurely flying along the fence or flowers, everything seemed to be busy. After the Communist Youth League members and villagers finished pulling the wheat, they busied themselves picking up the missed wheat, letting the scorching sun bake them, regardless of sweating backs, striving to bring every grain home. Some Communist Youth League members also used the time after lunch to pick up wheat in the fields and hand it over to the farm, without recording work points.

    When night fell, some people sat in front of their doors, puffing on their pipes, listening to operas, crosstalk, and news broadcast from the loudspeaker; some people sat together discussing this year's crops, harvest, and national affairs; children gathered around the elderly to listen to stories of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, the Monkey King wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Palace, and the stories of the elderly's past of fleeing famine and enduring hunger. But among these crowds, it is difficult to find a Communist Youth League member. Where have they all gone? They are all in the wheat field guarding the wheat!

    Late at night, people went to dreamland to eliminate the fatigue of the day. The fields were silent except for a few frog croaks and cuckoo calls. At this time, one or two figures often appeared from the small paths or wheat clumps, it turned out to be Communist Youth League members (occasionally youths) guarding the wheat.

                      Our reporter Li Baichao and Zhang Guanghua wrote and photographed (with pictures)
    In the early morning, the youth production team went to the fields to pull wheat.
    Pulling wheat is the most tiring work, but it is nothing in the face of the Communist Youth League members. When Zhao Shuying, a Communist Youth League member of the Ruihezhuang Production Team, was pulling wheat, although the sun was scorching, she always rushed ahead of others.
    Because the Communist Youth League members led the masses to actively respond to the call to return every grain to the household, more than 18,000 catties of wheat were added to the harvest in this wheat harvest. This is a youth production team member gathering ears of wheat.
    There are also two old farmers in the youth production team—Liu Fuwen and Cao Jitang. They impart their experience and skills to the young men anytime and anywhere and are often referred to as "advisors." Look, how clean the old farmer is winnowing!
    During the busy farming season, although literacy classes are temporarily suspended, the Communist Youth League members have not relaxed their literacy work. League member Dun Guangqin (second from the right) uses the break time on the wheat field to test the literacy class students on new characters.
    Zuo Lianjun fell ill during this busy farming season, but he did not listen to others' dissuasion and still ran around on the wheat field. Unity and mutual assistance are also the fine qualities of the League members.
    During the distribution, they took the initiative to help the family members of martyrs, military families, and the elderly move wheat home. This is military family member Lu Quande (left) happily watching Han Zhaoxiang carry the heavy wheat for him.

### 麦收中的共青团员

    麦收中的共青团员
    麦收时节，我们来到了北京南郊红星集体农庄。听到很多人都赞扬共青团员，我们就此进行了访问。
    以共青团员为骨干的青年生产队，已先将麦子收完了。我们问青年生产队的队长：“听说有联合收割机可以替你们收割，你们为什么要自己收呢？”他们说：“用联合收割机要付收割费呀！自己收可以节省开支。”我们又问：“自己收可用镰刀割，为什么你们要用手拔呢？”“用手可将麦子连根拔掉，能增加柴禾。”“拔，手能受得住吗？”他们说：“当然，手是够受的，许多人的手都肿了，但是我们终归是把麦子拔完了。”党支部书记在旁补充道：“我们四海庄生产大队开始拔了一天麦子之后，很多人都觉得任务艰巨，吓住了，建议用收割机收。但是我们的青年生产队却坚持用手拔，别的生产队被他们不怕艰苦的精神和显著的效果所鼓舞，也都继续用手拔了，拔麦任务胜利完成。青年生产队人虽少，但平均每人拔麦的面积却比其他队队员多几亩。”
    一个烈日当空的上午，瑞合庄生产大队在一片宽广的麦地里拔麦子。人潮吞卷着麦浪。人潮中出现几个前锋，最前的一个就是共青团员赵淑英，一位十八岁的姑娘。瑞合庄的共青团员不仅生产好，尤其爱惜公共财物。前几天，发现袋子里装的七、八千斤麦子发热了，有霉烂的危险，但天仍然是阴沉欲雨，不敢摊出晾晒，唯一的办法就是将它和带糠的麦子混搅在一起，让它逐渐冷却。共青团员和青年们挑起了这个担子，不辞劳苦，忙了一个通宵，将这些麦子全部混合好了，并要求不记工分。
    不但上述两个村子，整个红星集体农庄的共青团员在爱护公共财产和生产上都很出色。
    雄鸡三唱，大地那惺忪的眼睛才睁开一缝。这时，各个村头有幢幢的人影在蠕动——共青团员和庄员们开始下地收麦了。
    白天，除了蝴蝶悠闲地沿着篱笆或花草飞舞以外，好像什么都是忙的。共青团员和庄员们拔完麦子以后，又忙着拾漏下的麦子，任凭烈日蒸烤，不管汗流浃背，也要争取颗粒还家。有些共青团员，还利用午饭后的一段时间，到地里拾麦子，交农庄，不记工分。
    夜幕垂下，有的人坐在门前，噙着烟袋，听大喇叭播送出来的戏曲、相声和新闻；有些人围坐在一起谈论着今年的庄稼、收成和国家大事；孩子们围着老人家听讲牛郎织女、孙猴子大闹天宫及老人们过去逃荒挨饿的故事。但这些人群中你很难找到一个共青团员，那他（她）们都到哪儿去了？他们都在麦场上看护麦子呢！
    深夜，人们都走进梦乡消除一天的疲劳。田野里除了几声蛙鸣和鹃啼以外，是一片静寂。这时，从小道上或麦丛中常常会出现一两个人影，原来是共青团员（间或有青年）在看守麦子。

    清早，青年生产队下地去拔麦。
    拔麦子是最累的活儿，可是在共青团员的面前却算不了什么。瑞合庄生产队的共青团员赵淑英在拔麦子的时候，虽是烈日当头，但她总是抢在别人的前面。
    由于共青团员们带动群众积极响应颗粒还家的号召，所以在这次麦收中增加了一万八千多斤小麦的收获。这是青年生产队队员在拾穗。
    青年生产队里还有两位老农——刘辅文和曹济堂，他俩随时随地把经验、技术传授给青年小伙子们，常被人家称为“顾问”。看，老农扬得多净！
    在农忙季节里，虽然识字班暂时停了课，可是共青团员们对扫盲工作并没放松。团员顿广琴（右起第二人）利用麦场上歇息的时候，向识字班的学员考问生字。
    左连军在农忙这个时候病了，可是他没听旁人的劝阻，仍然奔跑在麦场上。团结、互助也是团员们的优良品德。
    在分配的时候，他们主动地替烈属、军属和老年人往家搬麦子。这是军属卢全德（左）高兴地看着韩兆祥替他扛起那沉重的麦子。
