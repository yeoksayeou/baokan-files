Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, representatives comprehensively counterattacked the bourgeois rightists who were launching frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism from various fronts.

    Universities and colleges were once the places where rightists fought most fiercely with the people. At the meeting, the representatives focused on criticizing and exposing the reactionary words and deeds of rightist elements such as Qian Weichang, Zeng Zhaolun, Tan Tiwu, Huang Yaomian, and Tao Dayong, who incited trouble in universities and colleges. Representatives such as Chen Shihua, Liang Sicheng, and Li Youshan systematically exposed the true face of the rightist Qian Weichang, who boasted of "following the revolution for twenty years" and being an "omnipotent scientist." They also revealed Qian Weichang's conspiracy to create and peddle a bourgeois education program, as well as his despicable history of consistently playing double-dealing tricks. Liang Sicheng and others pointed out that Qian Weichang was a "nouveau riche" who took advantage of the Party's policy on intellectuals, fished in troubled waters, and made a fortune in education and science. He was a major general in the Zhang-Luo alliance, and blinded by greed, he妄想(妄想 - presumptuous attempt/vainly wish) attempted to open a gap in education and science, dragging us back to capitalist society. Representative Shen Yifan pointed out that Zeng Zhaolun had consistently been anti-communist and anti-people since the War of Resistance Against Japan. He was actually the chief of staff of the Zhang-Luo alliance, so the "anti-socialist scientific program" drafted by Zeng Zhaolun and others and the vicious remarks on June 6 were not accidental. Representative Hu Xikui said that there were several lines of attack by bourgeois rightist elements on Beijing universities and colleges, and Tan Tiwu and Huang Shaohong were an important line. Hu Xikui read aloud a secret letter received by rightist Lin Xiling, in which Lin Xiling was told "not to be a surrendered general" and not to mention anything related to Tan Tiwu and Huang Shaohong. Hu Xikui pointed out that this proves that Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu were carrying out a conspiracy in Beijing universities and colleges. Hu Xikui also systematically revealed that the purpose of bourgeois rightist elements first igniting trouble in universities and colleges when attacking the Party and socialism was to attempt to turn universities and colleges into bases for capitalist restoration. Representative He Xilin systematically exposed the reactionary words and deeds of rightist elements Fu Zhongsun, Tao Dayong, Huang Yaomian, and Zhong Jingwen of Beijing Normal University. He pointed out that the common characteristics of these rightist elements' attacks on the Party were: attacking the Party's leadership, demanding "democratic school management"; opposing the Party's policy on intellectuals, opposing ideological remolding; and opposing the people's democratic dictatorship. In their speeches, the representatives also exposed the evil activities of rightist elements such as Li Zongen, president of Peking Union Medical College, Liu Jingfang, professor of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Liu Jingxiang and Liu Chijing, professors of Beijing Railway Institute, in universities and colleges.

    In their speeches, the representatives pointed out that these rightist elements who ignited trouble in universities and colleges are still unwilling to thoroughly confess. Rightist Tan Tiwu even said in a group discussion that "her vigilance was not high, she lost her position, and was used by Lin Xiling." When the representatives exposed her ugly history, she also耍无赖(Shuǎ lài - acted shamelessly) and骂(mà - cursed) the representatives for "talking nonsense." The representatives solemnly pointed out that the people have seen through the conspiracy of the rightist elements, and their dream of sneaking through will never be agreed to by the workers, peasants, and five million intellectuals of the country. If they want to pass, they must thoroughly confess and thoroughly criticize their ugly intentions.

    In their speeches, the representatives pointed out that many Beijing organizations of democratic parties took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch attacks on the Communist Party and socialism. "During the period when the Zhang-Luo alliance stole the leadership of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, the Democratic League was the command headquarters for rightists to oppose the Party and oppose socialism." This was pointed out by Wu Han, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, in his speech. Wu Han went on to point out that an important conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance was to attempt to steal the leadership of the local organizations of the China Democratic League. They tried every possible means to seize the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and when they failed, they changed their tactics and directly reached out to the grassroots organizations of the Beijing Democratic League, using rightist elements within the League to carry out anti-Party and anti-people activities. Wu Han pointed out that the purpose of their evil actions was, on the one hand, to drive the Party organization out of schools and state organs, and on the other hand, to summon souls and appeal for grievances for counter-revolutionaries,妄想(wàngxiǎng - presumptuous attempts) attempting to turn the people's world into the world of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Many representatives exposed the evil deeds of rightist elements such as Li Boqiu, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Li Jiansheng, vice chairman, in carrying out activities in the medical and health circles. Representative Zhao Bingnan said that Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng, and others unscrupulously developed the organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and cultivated rightist forces, attempting to turn the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital into their stronghold for opposing the Party and opposing socialism. Zhao Peimou, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing Municipal Health Workers Association, also exposed Li Jiansheng's conspiracy activities in the medical field in his capacity as deputy director of the Public Health Bureau. The representatives also criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of Xue Yu, chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society and director of the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College. The representatives pointed out that Xue Yu, on the one hand, spread rumors and slandered that the pharmaceutical industry was discriminated against, and he "called on" pharmaceutical workers to stand up and "pour out their bitterness," and on the other hand, he greatly attacked the leadership of the Ministry of Health, saying that the leadership of the Ministry of Health "neither understands medicine nor can listen to the opinions of experts," and openly advocated that "the Ministry of Health should remove a few deputy ministers who do not understand the business and add a few deputy ministers who understand the business." Representative Ye Gongshao said: We want to question Xue Yu, what is the purpose of doing this?

    At the meeting, the representatives also exposed and criticized the words and deeds of rightist elements in the industrial and commercial circles, the medical and health circles, and the engineering and technical circles. Representative Yang Bin also exposed the activities of rightist elements in middle schools.

    At every meeting, representatives from factories, rural areas, schools, and government agencies used their own experiences to illustrate the rapid development of various aspects of work and the continuous improvement of people's living standards since liberation, refuting the fallacies of rightist elements who slandered the Party and slandered the socialist cause.

    This meeting opened on July 23 and will continue.

    在北京市人民代表大会的讲坛上
    来自各界的代表全面反击右派
    本报讯　新华社专稿：在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上，代表们对从各个战线上向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的资产阶级右派分子，进行了全面反击。
    高等学校曾是右派分子同人民博斗得十分激烈的场所。会上代表们着重批判和揭露了在高等学校点火煽动的钱伟长、曾昭抡、谭惕吾、黄药眠、陶大镛等右派分子的反动言行。陈士骅、梁思成、李酉山等代表在会上系统地揭露了右派分子钱伟长自吹“跟随革命二十年”、“万能科学家”的面目，还揭穿了钱伟长制造和贩卖资产阶级教育纲领的阴谋，以及一贯耍两面派手法的卑劣事实。梁思成等人指出：钱伟长是一个钻了党的知识分子政策的空子，混水摸鱼，发了教育科学财的“暴发户”。他是章罗联盟中的一员大将，他利令智昏妄想从教育科学方面打开缺口，把我们拖回资本主义社会去。沈一帆代表指出：曾昭抡从抗战以来就一贯是反共反人民的，他实际是章罗联盟集团的参谋长，所以曾昭抡等所起草的“反社会主义科学纲领”和6月6日的恶毒言论并不是偶然的。胡锡奎代表说：资产阶级右派分子向北京高等学校进攻是有几条线的，而谭惕吾、黄绍竑是条重要的线。胡锡奎当场读了右派分子林希翎收到的一封密信，密信里要林希翎“不要做投降将军”，不要说与谭惕吾、黄绍竑有关的事情。胡锡奎指出：由此证明黄绍竑、谭惕吾在北京高等学校中进行一种阴谋活动。胡锡奎还系统地揭露了资产阶级右派分子向党向社会主义进攻时，首先在高等学校点火的目的，是企图把高等学校变成资本主义复辟的根据地。何锡麟代表在会上系统地揭发了北京师范大学右派分子傅钟孙、陶大镛、黄药眠、钟敬文等人的反动言行。他指出这些右派分子向党进攻的共同特点是：攻击党的领导，要“民主治校”；反对党的知识分子政策，反对思想改造；反对人民民主专政制度。在发言中代表们还揭露了协和医学院院长李宗恩、北京钢铁学院教授刘景芳、北京铁道学院教授刘景向、刘炽晶等右派分子在高等学校里的罪恶活动。
    代表们在发言中指出这些在高等学校点火煽动的右派分子们，现在还不肯彻底交代。右派分子谭惕吾在小组发言中还说“自己警惕性不高，丧失立场，被林希翎利用了”。当代表们在揭露她的丑恶历史的时候，她还耍无赖谩骂代表是“胡说八道”。代表们严正指出：人民已识破右派分子的阴谋，他们梦想蒙混过关，全国的工人、农民和五百万知识分子是决不答应的，要过关就必须把丑恶的意图全部彻底交代、彻底批判。
    在发言中代表们指出了许多民主党派北京市组织利用共产党整风时机向共产党向社会主义发起了进攻。“民主同盟在章罗联盟盗窃民盟中央领导权的一段时期内，是右派反党反社会主义的指挥部。”这是民盟北京市主任委员吴晗在会上发言指出的。吴晗接着指出：章罗联盟的一个重要阴谋就是企图窃取民盟地方组织的领导权。他们千方百计企图夺取民盟北京市委领导权，不得逞后，就改变手法直接伸手到北京民盟基层组织，利用盟内的右派分子进行反党反人民的活动。吴晗指出：他们进行罪恶的行动目的是一方面要把党组织赶出学校和国家机关，一方面又替反革命分子招魂申冤，要求翻案。妄想以此把人民天下变成章罗联盟的天下。许多代表揭露了农工民主党北京市委主任委员李伯球、副主委李健生等右派分子在医药卫生界进行活动的罪恶行为。赵炳南代表说：李伯球、李健生等在中医医院不择手段大肆发展农工民主党组织，培植右派力量。企图把中医院作为他们反党反社会主义的据点。北京市卫生工作者协会副秘书长赵培谋也揭发了李健生以公共卫生局副局长的身份在医务界进行阴谋活动的情形。代表们并且批判了九三学社北京市分社主任委员、北京医学院药学系主任薛愚的反党反社会主义的言论。代表们指出薛愚一面造谣污蔑说药学事业被歧视，他“号召”药工人员起来“吐尽苦水”，一面又大肆攻击卫生部领导，说卫生部的领导“既不懂药，又不能听内行人的意见”，公开主张“卫生部应该去掉几个不懂业务的副部长，要添几个懂业务的副部长”。叶恭绍代表说：我们要责问薛愚这样做的目的何在？
    会议上代表们还揭露批判了工商界、医药卫生界、工程技术界等方面的右派分子言行。杨滨代表并且揭露了右派分子在中学里活动的情形。
    在每天会议上都有来自工厂、农村、学校、机关的代表，用切身经历的事实，说明解放以后各方面工作飞跃发展，人民生活水平不断上升的情形，驳斥右派分子污蔑党污蔑社会主义事业的谬论。
    此次会议是在7月23日开幕的，会议将继续进行。
