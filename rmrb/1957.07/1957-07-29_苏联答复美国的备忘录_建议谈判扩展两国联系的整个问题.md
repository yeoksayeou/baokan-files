    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 28th: In a memorandum submitted to the U.S. State Department on July 26th, the Soviet Foreign Ministry stated that, considering the undoubted promotion of improved Soviet-U.S. relations through the development of broad ties and contacts between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet Foreign Ministry proposed that the two governments conduct negotiations on the entire issue of developing contacts and ties between the two countries, including the exchange of radio and television programs, so that Soviet-U.S. ties and contacts could develop on a solid foundation.
    This memorandum is a response to the memorandum submitted by the U.S. State Department to the Soviet government on June 24th. In its memorandum, the U.S. State Department suggested that the two governments reach an agreement as soon as possible on the principles of regularly exchanging uninspected radio and television programs in order to promote a freer exchange of information and views on major international events. In its memorandum, the Soviet Foreign Ministry pointed out that in recent years, the Soviet Union has made a series of specific proposals to the United States regarding the development of various ties between the Soviet Union and the United States. Unfortunately, the attitude held by the U.S. government has prevented the contacts between the two countries from achieving the due development until now.

    苏联答复美国的备忘录
    建议谈判扩展两国联系的整个问题
    据新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部在7月26日提交给美国国务院的一份备忘录中说，考虑到发展苏美两国人民之间的广泛联系和接触无疑地会促进苏美联系的改善，苏联外交部建议两国政府就发展两国之间的接触和联系的整个问题进行谈判，其中包括交换无线电和电视广播节目的问题，以便使苏美之间的联系和接触在巩固的基础上发展。
    这份备忘录是答复美国国务院在6月24日提交给苏联政府的备忘录的。美国国务院在备忘录中，曾经建议两国政府尽快地就关于定期交换不经检查的无线电和电视广播节目的原则达成协议，以便促使更自由地交换有关重大国际事件的情报和看法。苏联外交部在备忘录中指出，在最近几年中，苏联曾经向美国提出过一系列关于发展苏美两国之间各种联系的具体建议。令人遗憾的是，美国政府所抱的态度使两国之间的接触直到现在还没有获得应有的发展。
