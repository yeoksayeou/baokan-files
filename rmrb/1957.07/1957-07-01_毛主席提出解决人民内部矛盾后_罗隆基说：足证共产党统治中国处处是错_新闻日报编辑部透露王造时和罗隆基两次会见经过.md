Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th - A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the News Daily editorial department that after rightist Wang Zaoshi returned to Shanghai from attending the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March of this year, he conveyed to Lu Yi, deputy editor-in-chief of the News Daily, the details of two meetings with Luo Longji in Beijing.

Wang Zaoshi told Lu Yi, "Nu Sheng (Luo Longji) has also been very distressed in the central government these past few years. He became the Minister of Forestry, but in reality, there is nothing much to do in that ministry. He does aspire to engage in diplomatic activities." After listening to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, Luo Longji said, "To raise the issue of contradictions among the people now proves that the Communist Party's rule of China has been wrong in every way these past few years." Luo Longji and Wang Zaoshi exchanged views on the international situation, believing that "the situation is still very tense," and "it seems that the international situation may not be as Premier Zhou said, with the general trend moving towards relaxation." They believed that "there is no hope for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan." They also exchanged opinions on the domestic situation. Seeing that there were disturbances in some parts of the country, Luo Longji and Wang Zaoshi believed that saying China would not become a second Hungary was "very doubtful." Luo Longji also told Wang Zaoshi, "The more the country is in trouble, the more we must step up and take responsibility." He advised Wang Zaoshi to come out and speak more. Luo Longji said, "Recently, I spoke for the interests of intellectuals, and the intellectuals supported me. To win over the masses, you rely on writing articles and giving speeches." Luo Longji told Wang Zaoshi that he had major conflicts with Shen Junru and Shi Liang, but was very close to Zhang Bojun. Luo Longji also praised Wenhui Bao for "playing a significant role nationwide" and told Wang Zaoshi to write more articles for Wenhui Bao.

After Wang Zaoshi returned to Shanghai, he also conveyed Luo Longji's instructions to rightists in Shanghai such as Peng Wenying and Sun Dayu. When Lu Yi conveyed to Sun Dayu that Gu Zhizhong wanted Sun Dayu to speak "more tactfully," Sun Dayu smiled and said, "Isn't it now proposed to help the Communist Party eliminate the three isms? Why not come out and speak at this time?" Lu Yi also admitted that this was indeed an opportunity to attack the Party.

    毛主席提出解决人民内部矛盾后
    罗隆基说：足证共产党统治中国处处是错
    新闻日报编辑部透露王造时和罗隆基两次会见经过
    新华社上海30日电　新华社记者从新闻日报编辑部获悉：右派分子王造时在今年3月参加政协全国委员会会议回上海后，曾向新闻日报副总编辑陆诒传达了在北京同罗隆基两次会见的经过。
    王造时告诉陆诒说：“努生（罗隆基）这几年在中央也苦闷得很，当上森林工业部部长，实际上这个部是没有什么事可做的。他倒有志于搞外交活动。”在听了毛主席在最高国务会议的报告以后，罗隆基说：“到现在再来提人民内部矛盾问题，足证共产党统治中国这几年到处都是错误。”罗隆基和王造时交换了对国际局势的看法，认为“局势还是很紧张的”，“看起来国际局势未必就像周总理说的总的趋势是走向缓和。”他们认为“和平解放台湾，那是没有希望的”。他们对国内局势也交换了意见，罗隆基和王造时看到国内有些地方有人闹事，就认为说中国不会闹成匈牙利第二“很可怀疑”。罗隆基还告诉王造时说：“越是在国家多事的时候，我们越要起来担当责任。”他劝王造时也出来多讲些话。罗隆基说：“最近我为知识分子利益说话，知识分子就拥护我了。争取群众，就靠写文章和讲话。”罗隆基告诉王造时，他和沈钧儒、史良矛盾很大，和章伯钧倒是很接近。罗隆基还赞扬文汇报“在全国起了很大作用”，要王造时多给文汇报写文章。
    王造时回到上海后，还把罗隆基的指示向上海的右派分子彭文应、孙大雨等作了传达。在陆诒向孙大雨传达顾执中要孙大雨说话“策略一点”的时候，孙大雨笑着说：“现在不是提出要帮助共产党整掉三个主义吗？为什么这个时候不起来说话？”陆诒也就承认这确实是向党进攻的时机了。
