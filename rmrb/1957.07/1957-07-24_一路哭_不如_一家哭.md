"Crying All the Way" Is Not as Good as "One Family Cries"
　　Ke Yue
　　Currently, many rightists are using various methods to evade, disguise, and seek sympathy when they are attacked and besieged. Some rightists even have their whole families weeping bitterly, attempting to gain people's sympathy. Some soft-hearted people are unable to distinguish this clearly, and show pity, feeling that the struggle against the rightists can be stopped appropriately, and suspecting that the movement has gone too far.

　　One should think about it, if the rightists' conspiracy succeeds: the Communist Party steps down, the socialist system is overthrown. Then, among the Communist Party members, cadres, and millions of working people, countless heads will fall, and that is "crying all the way."

　　As the old saying goes: "One family crying is better than crying all the way." Meaning: compared to crying all the way, one family crying is really nothing. The "one family crying" of some rightists may not be real, and even if it is a real "one family crying," before they have truly bowed their heads to the people or confessed their crimes to the people, in order to prevent the restoration of the capitalist system, which would cause millions of working people to "cry all the way," then we should still thoroughly expose their anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities, and let them "one family cry"! In fact, as long as the rightists repent sincerely, they will no longer cry, and will even laugh in the future. If the rightists stubbornly resist to the end and violate criminal law, they will not be forgiven by the people. At that time, they will keep crying. Since they insist on doing so, there is nothing to be done. So we still believe that "crying all the way is not as good as one family crying," and "one family crying is better than crying all the way."

    “一路哭”不如“一家哭”
  　克约
    目前，不少右派分子在遭到反击和围攻时，用各种各样的方法逃避，伪装，争取同情。甚至有的右派分子阖家痛哭，企图博取人们的同情。一些软心肠的人们对此分辨不清，寄予怜悯，觉得反右派的斗争可以适可而止了，怀疑运动是否过火了。
    应该想一想，如果右派分子的阴谋得逞：共产党下台，社会主义制度被推翻。那么，共产党员、干部、千百万劳动人民中就不知有多少人头落地，这就是“一路哭”。
    古语说得好：“一家哭何如一路哭”。意思是说：比起一路哭来，一家哭实在算不得什么。某些右派分子的“一家哭”不一定是真的，就是真的“一家哭”，当他还未真正向人民低头或向人民伏罪之前，为了不让资本主义制度复活，而造成千百万劳动人民“一路哭”，那就还是彻底地揭露他们反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，让他们“一家哭”吧！其实，只要右派分子憣然悔悟，就不会再哭，将来还会笑的。如果右派分子顽抗到底，触犯刑律，就得不到人民的宽恕。那时，他们是会一直哭下去的。既然他们硬要这样，也就没有法子。就这我们还是认为“一路哭不如一家哭”，“一家哭胜似一路哭”。
