　　Egypt's Three Major Festivals

　　The Egyptian government announced in mid-July that July 22nd would be designated as "National Assembly Day," July 23rd as "Army Day," and July 26th as "People's Day." These three dates all hold significant meaning in Egyptian history.

　　National Assembly Day

　　July 22nd marks the day the first National Assembly after the Egyptian Revolution held its opening ceremony.

　　The National Assembly, elected by universal suffrage according to the new Egyptian constitution, is the highest legislative body in Egypt. Elections for the National Assembly began on July 3rd. After two rounds of voting on July 3rd and July 14th, the Egyptian National Assembly was born. The victory of the election and the opening of the National Assembly represent an important achievement for Egypt in developing democratic life and consolidating its political system.

　　Egypt's "Army Day"

　　July 23rd is Egypt's "Army Day." Five years ago on this day, a group of Egyptian officers led by Nasser launched a revolution that overthrew the Farouk feudal dynasty.

　　As early as World War II, patriotic Egyptian officers organized an underground organization against British imperialism, namely the "Free Officers Movement" led by Nasser. After the war, the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle flourished. In 1948, Egypt was dragged into the Palestine War by the imperialists and suffered a crushing defeat. This made the patriotic officers even more clearly see the corruption and incompetence of the Egyptian feudal dynasty, and realize that in order to seek national independence, it was necessary to first overthrow the feudal dynasty that colluded with imperialism. In 1950, the "Free Officers Movement" established an executive committee and carried out activities more actively. By 1952, its secret organizations had spread to all branches of the military. Under the vigorous development of the national liberation movement, the executive committee of the "Free Officers Movement" launched a revolution on July 23, 1952. The army occupied the headquarters in Kubba and many military facilities overnight, and surrounded Farouk's summer palace in Alexandria. As a result, the reactionary Farouk dynasty was overthrown, and the Egyptian national independence struggle was further developed.

　　After the victory of the revolution, in order to consolidate the regime and oppose foreign aggression, the strength of the Egyptian armed forces has been continuously strengthened. Now Egypt has a modern armed force. Last year, when Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt, the Egyptian armed forces cooperated with the Egyptian National Liberation Army (National Guard) in combat, inflicting heavy blows on the invaders and defending the sovereignty and independence of the Egyptian people.

　　Egypt's "People's Day"

　　July 26th is Egypt's "People's Day." The Egyptian people will celebrate two major events:

　　Five years ago on this day (July 26, 1952), Egypt's last king, Farouk, was deposed by the revolutionary regime and forced to leave Egypt by ship from Alexandria. Subsequently, the Egyptian "Revolutionary Command Council" confiscated the vast estates of the palace clique, abolished social ranks and noble titles, and abolished the 1923 constitution that maintained the interests of the feudal monarch and imperialism. On June 18, 1953, the "Revolutionary Command Council" announced the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Arab Republic of Egypt.

　　One year ago on this day, July 26, 1956, Egyptian President Nasser solemnly announced to the people of the country that the Suez Canal Company, the last powerful stronghold of imperialism in Egypt, would be nationalized. This was a major victory for the Egyptian people in their struggle to consolidate independence and safeguard sovereignty.

### 埃及的三大节日

    埃及的三大节日
    埃及政府在本月中旬宣布，把7月22日定为“国民议会节”，7月23日为“陆军节”，7月26日为“人民节”。这三个日子在埃及的历史上都具有重大的意义。
    国民议会节
    7月22日是埃及革命后第一届国民议会举行开幕式的日子。
    根据埃及新宪法由普选而产生的国民议会，是埃及的最高立法机关。国民议会的选举是从7月3日开始进行的。经过7月3日和7月14日的两次投票，埃及国民议会诞生了。选举的胜利和国民议会的开幕，是埃及在发展民主生活和巩固政权制度中获得的重要成就。
    埃及“陆军节”
    7月23日是埃及的“陆军节”。五年前的这一天，以纳赛尔为首的一批埃及军官发动了推翻法鲁克封建王朝的革命。
    早在第二次世界大战期间，埃及的爱国军官就组织了反对英帝国主义的地下组织，即以纳赛尔为首的“自由军官组织”。战后，埃及人民反帝斗争蓬勃发展。1948年，埃及被帝国主义者拖入巴勒斯坦战争，遭到惨败。这更使爱国的军官们清楚地看到埃及封建王朝的腐化无能，认识到要谋求民族独立就必须首先推翻与帝国主义相勾结的封建王朝。1950年“自由军官组织”成立了执行委员会，更加积极地进行活动。到1952年，它的秘密组织已遍及各兵种，在全国民族解放运动蓬勃发展下，“自由军官组织”执行委员会在1952年7月23日发动了革命，军队在一夜之间就占领了库巴的司令部和许多军事设施，并且把法鲁克在亚历山大港的夏宫也包围了。结果，反动的法鲁克王朝被推翻了，埃及民族独立斗争得到了进一步的发展。
    在革命胜利后，为了巩固政权和反对外国的侵略，埃及武装部队力量不断地加强了。现在埃及已拥有一支现代化的武装部队。去年在英、法、以侵略埃及的时候，埃及武装部队与埃及民族解放军（国民警卫队）配合作战，给侵略者沉重的打击，捍卫了埃及人民的主权与独立。
    埃及“人民节”
    7月26日是埃及“人民节”。埃及人民将庆祝两桩重大的事件：
    五年前的这一天（1952年7月26日），埃及最后一个国王法鲁克被革命政权废黜，被迫从亚历山大港搭船离开埃及。接着，埃及“革命指导委员会”没收了宫廷集团的庞大地产，取消社会等级和贵族称号，废除了1923年维护封建君主及帝国主义利益的宪法。1953年6月18日，“革命指导委员会”宣布废除帝制，建立埃及共和国。
    一年前的这一天，1956年7月26日，埃及总统纳赛尔向全国人民庄严宣布，把帝国主义在埃及的最后强大堡垒苏伊士运河公司收归国有。这是埃及人民在巩固独立和维护主权的斗争中的重大胜利。
