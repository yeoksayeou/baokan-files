    The Old Boatman of Anshunchang
    Jin Fan
    A lone wooden boat,
    Anchored on the bank of the Anshunchang River;
    The Dadu River churns with whirlpools,
    Roaring and raising giant waves,
    Crashing against the craggy high mountains on both banks.
    The old boatman stands on the shore,
    Pointing to the churning waves below:
    "Back then, it was with such a wooden boat,
    That I carried seventeen warriors,
    Dashed to the opposite bank like an arrow.
    "The enemy's shells fell into the river,
    Stirring up towering waterspouts;
    Seventeen warriors passed through the gunfire,
    Leapt onto the rocks at Taozi Bay on the opposite side,
    Wiped out the enemy and captured the peak.
    "After the Red Army left, the White Army, with executioners,
    Came everywhere to capture us boatmen;
    We fled into the deep mountains and dense forests,
    Not daring to go home for many years,
    Living with wild beasts at night.
    "Twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye,
    The Dadu River still roars with waves,
    Although mountain floods have washed away the river beach of that year,
    Washed away the gun emplacements on the beach of that year—
    The people on the shore will forever cherish the Red Army.
    "We transported them to the opposite bank,
    They removed the heavy mountain from our heads;
    For thousands of generations, our descendants
    When they see boats on the Dadu River,
    Their faces will also light up with glory.”

    安顺场的老船夫
    金帆
    一支孤独的木船，
    停泊在安顺场河畔；
    大渡河翻滚着漩涡，
    轰隆隆地举起巨大的浪花，
    拍打着两岸巉岩的高山。
    老船夫站在岸上，
    指着下面的惊涛骇浪：
    “当年就是用这样的木船，
    载着十七位勇士，
    冲到对岸像箭一样。
    “敌人的炮弹落到河中，
    激起了高大的水柱；
    十七位勇士穿过炮火，
    在对面的桃子湾飞上岩石，
    扑灭了敌人，占领了高峰。
    “红军走后，白军带着刽子手，
    到处来抓我们船夫；
    我们逃到深山密林，
    好几年不敢回家，
    晚上就跟野兽一齐居住。
    “二十年的时间转眼过去，
    大渡河一样浪花滚滚，
    虽然山洪冲垮了当年的河滩，
    冲垮了当年滩上的炮台——
    岸上的人民永远怀念着红军。
    “我们将他们运到对岸，
    他们替我们搬掉头上的大山；
    千秋万代，我们的子孙
    望见大渡河上的船只，
    脸上也会露出光彩。”
