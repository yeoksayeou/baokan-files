　　Editor's Note: In order to help readers understand our brotherly nations, we have opened up this small area and plan to meet with readers several times a month, using short articles and pictures to introduce the scenery, products, and customs of Eastern European brother countries. Readers, especially comrades who have been to Eastern Europe, are welcome to send manuscripts, pictures, and materials to us.

　　Karlovy Vary (see picture above), where the Tenth International Film Festival was recently held, is an unforgettable place. I visited it once last year.

　　Karlovy Vary is about 120 kilometers from Prague and is located in the long and narrow valley on both sides of the Teplá River (translated as Warm River). Driving along the asphalt road at the foot of the mountain, you can see tall and dense beeches and chestnut trees everywhere.

　　This city, famous as a spa resort, has a population of only about 25,000, and no more than 40,000 including the industrial area. However, every spring and summer, tourists are like clouds, and even the Czechoslovak friends who accompanied us on the tour could not tell how many tourists there were.

　　It is said that the mineral springs here have been serving human health for more than 600 years. There is a legend: a long time ago, King Charles IV of Bohemia was hunting in the Teplá River Valley. A deer that was being chased jumped off a cliff and died in the hot spring water, thus discovering the hot spring. The original Czech meaning of "Karlovy Vary" is "Charles' Hot Water Stove," and the image of the jumping deer has become the symbol of the city.

　　Before starting the tour, the host gave each person a flat, round porcelain cup. The porcelain cup is very delicate, with blue ground and gold patterns, and a spout. Exquisite porcelain and carved glassware are also famous products here. They shine like jewels in the windows of many shops. There is a porcelain manufacturing enterprise not far from the city. There is also a permanent exhibition introducing the development of local porcelain over the past 150 years.

　　Everyone who comes here for the first time must buy a porcelain cup and taste the mineral water. We walked slowly along the river bank with the cups given to us by the host. The river water was clear and shallow. There is a semi-circular shelf by the river, with steam coming out of the gaps, which feels very warm. This is the mineral spring. The water temperature of this spring eye is as high as 73 degrees Fahrenheit. The spring water, which is sprayed up from 1,800 meters underground, forms a water column of more than ten meters on the ground, and then scatters into countless water flowers. People use porcelain cups to collect water to drink next to a faucet.

　　All twelve mineral springs in Karlovy Vary can spray more than 2,000 liters of spring water per minute. Drinking mineral water can cure internal organ diseases such as gallbladder, liver, intestines, and stomach, and mineral water baths can improve health. The spring water contains a large amount of minerals. Flowers immersed in this spring water for a year will turn into stone flowers. Local shops sell these stone flowers.

　　The city's buildings are built against the mountains and rivers, with varying heights. Statues and monuments are everywhere, telling people that Peter the Great, Marx, Goethe, Gogol, Turgenev, Schiller, Chopin... have all been guests here. We visited the statue of Beethoven under the shade of towering trees. The great musician's burly body leaned forward slightly, bowing his head in contemplation, as if listening to the gurgling of the water.

　　It was already dark when we left Karlovy Vary. On the way to Maria's Spa, we saw the lights connecting the countryside and the city. The host pointed and told us: there is a newly built iron and steel plant, there is a cement plant, an automobile factory...

    疗养胜地卡罗维发利
    丘述德
    编者按：为了帮助读者了解兄弟之邦，我们开辟了这个小小园地，准备每月同读者见面数次，用短文和图片介绍东欧兄弟国家的风光、物产和习俗。欢迎读者，特别是到过东欧的同志，惠寄这方面的稿件、图片和资料给我们。
    最近举行了第十届国际电影节的卡罗维发利（见上图），是一个令人难忘的地方，去年我曾到那里去过一次。
    卡罗维发利距布拉格约一百二十公里，座落在捷普拉河（意译为暖河）两岸狭长的谷地上。驱车顺着山脚下的柏油路行驶，到处可以看到高大茂密的山毛榉和栗子树。
    这个以疗养胜地闻名于世的城市，人口只有二万五千左右，加上工业区也不过四万人。但是，每年春夏，游客如云，连陪我们游览的捷克斯洛伐克朋友也说不清游览者究竟有多少。
    据说，这里的矿泉为人类的健康服务，已有六百多年历史了。有一个传说：很久以前，波希米亚国王查理四世在捷普拉河谷打猎，一只被追赶的小鹿跳下悬崖，在泉水里烫死了，于是发现了温泉。“卡罗维发利”的捷克文原意就是“查理的开水炉子”，而跳鹿的形象就成了这个城市的标志。
    在开始游览之前，主人赠送给每人一个扁圆形的瓷杯。瓷杯做得很精致，蓝地金纹，还有一个嘴。精制瓷器和雕花玻璃器皿也是这里的名产，它们在许多商店的橱窗里闪着宝石般的光彩。离城不远就有瓷器制造企业。还有一个常设的展览会，介绍了当地瓷器一百五十年来的发展情况。
    每个初到这里的人，都要买个瓷杯，尝一尝矿泉水。我们带着主人给我们的杯子，沿着河岸缓步而行。河水清浅见底。河边有个半圆形的高架子，空隙里冒着蒸气，走进去感到非常暖热。这就是矿泉。这个泉眼，水温高达华氏七十三度。从一千八百公尺地下喷上来的泉水，在地面形成十几公尺的水柱，然后散作无数水花。人们在一个水龙头旁用瓷杯接水喝。
    卡罗维发利全部十二个矿泉，每分钟可以喷出二千多公升泉水。饮矿泉水可以治胆、肝、肠、胃等内脏病，做矿水浴能增进身体健康。泉水含有大量的矿物质。花朵在这种泉水中浸上一年，就会变成石花。当地的商店里就有这种石花出售。
    城市的建筑物依山傍水，高低参差。雕像和纪念碑到处皆是，它们告诉人们，彼得大帝、马克思、歌德、果戈理、屠格涅夫、席勒、萧邦……都曾到这里来作客。我们在浓荫蔽天的大树下拜谒了贝多芬雕像。伟大音乐家魁梧的身躯微向前倾，俯首沉思，好像在倾听潺潺的水声。
    离开卡罗维发利的时候天已擦黑。在到玛丽亚温泉去的路上，我们看到灯光把乡村和城市连成一片。主人指点着告诉我们：那里是新建起来的炼铁厂，那里是水泥厂、汽车厂……
