    Make Members Understand Publicized Accounts
    Zhang Zenbao
    Since 1955, the Da’geng Agricultural Cooperative in Yutou Township, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, has been publicizing the cooperative's accounts to its members. However, the publicized accounts were incomprehensible to the members, so naturally, they couldn't see any problems. The general sentiment was: "Publicizing the accounts like this is no different from not publicizing them at all."
    This year, the cooperative's accountants, Mao Honggao and Ye Wenyou, proactively sought opinions from the members regarding the publicized accounts. These opinions were:
    1. Due to the large number of households and the dispersed areas, it was requested that the accounts be publicized by group.
    2. It was requested that all cash receipts and payments be publicized item by item, broken down by subject and by physical object.
    3. It was requested that "Arabic numerals" be changed to Chinese characters in upper and lower case, that decimal points not be used, and that yuan, jiao, and fen be used instead.
    4. It was requested that the accounts be publicized once a month.
    Based on these requests from the members, the accounting comrades first conducted an inventory check indoors, reviewed the ledger, and verified receipts. Then, they brought the accounts and vouchers to the members at their homes and in the fields to reconcile each payment item by item, broken down by subject. In accordance with the members' requests, they also compiled detailed lists of work points, investments, advance payments from share funds, member dividends, seeds retained by the cooperative, grain deliveries, agricultural loan repayments, cash inventory, physical inventory, and income and expenditure from agriculture and sideline occupations, item by item and broken down by project. These lists were printed and distributed to each group for further review by the members. Arabic numerals were also changed to Chinese characters in upper case; the unit of calculation was changed to yuan, jiao, and fen; and it was established as a system that accounts be publicized once a month.
    Such accounts are both easy to understand and accurate, so that ordinary members can understand them. Therefore, after the accounts were printed and distributed to each group, everyone made a serious inspection and reconciliation. They showed greater concern for the cooperative's affairs, and the rumors and gossip of the past were no longer heard.

    让社员看懂公布的账目
    张增宝
    浙江江山县淤头乡达埂农业社，从1955年以来，就开始把社内账目向社员公开。但是公布的账目社员们看不懂，当然看不出有什么问题。大家普遍反映：“这样公布账目和不公布账目没有两样。”
    今年，社里的会计毛洪高和叶文有主动地征求社员对公布账目的意见。这些意见是：
    一、由于社大户多、地区分散，要求以小组为单位公布账目。
    二、要求分科目、分实物、现金收付逐笔逐项公布。
    三、要求将“阿拉伯字”改为大写、小写的中文，不要用小数点，要改用元、角、分。
    四、要求每月公布一次。
    根据社员的这些要求，会计同志首先在室内进行清查库存，翻账面，对单据，然后带账、带凭证下家、下田坂向社员作支、付的逐笔逐项分科目校对；又根据社员的要求把工分、投资、预支股份基金、社员分红、社里留的种籽、交粮、还农贷、现金库存、实物库存、农副业收支等逐笔分项目进行开列清单，印发公布各小组，进一步让社员审查；阿拉伯字也改用中文大写；计算单位改用元、角、分；账目每月公布一次订为制度。
    这样的账目既通俗易懂，又正确清楚，一般社员都能看得懂了。因此账目印发各组后，大家都作了认真的检查校对，对社里的事表现得更为关切，过去风言风语的话也听不见了。
