Doing Ideological Work

During the summer harvest distribution in Shahe Township, Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, it was discovered that the cooperative members generally lacked a correct understanding of national interests and the superiority of collectivization. For example, some members felt the grain retention standard was too low and advocated for distributing more, deducting less, and selling less surplus grain; some well-to-do middle peasants, seeing the shortcomings of the cooperative, began to waver in their commitment to joining; and a few peasants, forgetting the suffering of the old society, made excessive demands on the new society, even failing to see the benefits of the new society. In response to these ideological ailments, the Party branch organized a propaganda team of more than 160 people, holding discussion meetings everywhere and visiting homes to educate the members on "three observations" and "six comparisons."

What are the "three observations"?

First, observe the working class's support for the peasants. They organized peasants to attend discussions from nearby to far away, witnessing the facts of workers supporting peasants. The Fourth Team of the Democratic Cooperative, with 26 households, consumed more than 1,100 jin of salt last year, bought 37 zhang of foreign cloth, and purchased 113 pieces of sickles and hoes, as well as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Everyone also pointed out that the cars running on the Xizhen road and the telephones installed in the township were all things workers provided to support the peasants. Originally, some people said, "If peasants don't produce, workers will starve." Now the saying has changed: "We are short-sighted, only seeing our own role and not seeing the greatness of the working-class elder brothers."

Second, observe the state's assistance to the peasants. The Democratic Cooperative calculated during the discussions that this year alone, state loans, relief funds, and other funds amounted to more than 1,700 yuan, equivalent to more than 35,700 jin of rice. However, the summer grain purchase task was only 15,000 jin. After this calculation, the members said, "The state helps us so much!"

Third, observe the superiority of collectivization. Is leaving the cooperative better than joining? The cooperatives also affirmed this question in the discussions. After the Democratic Cooperative transitioned to a higher-level cooperative last year, manpower, materials, and financial resources were concentrated. They repaired seven ponds and expanded the irrigation area by more than 120 mu, increasing grain production by more than 84,000 jin from this alone. With increased production, the members all increased their income, and the helpless also received "five guarantees." Everyone talked about these facts, and no one was hesitant anymore.

What are the "six comparisons"? Compare the social system, compare the quality of production, compare the quality of life, compare the increase in population, the improvement of people's consumption, and the inability of production to keep up with needs, compare culture and education, and compare the work style of cadres. These "six comparisons" are all comparisons with before liberation and with the previous few years. During the process of comparison, through their own vivid and specific facts, everyone further recognized the relationship between the country and their own happy lives. Poor peasant Song Huaizhen said, "The old society was one evil, two bullies, three extortionists, four beaters, five conscriptors, six forced laborers, and exorbitant taxes, forcing people to have no way to survive." Talking about the present, everyone summarized it as "five haves"—the people have freedom, production has land to cultivate, society has order, everyone has clothes to wear, and everyone has food to eat; "six no's"—no exploitation, no bandits, no opium addicts, no gambling, no exorbitant taxes, and no starvation; "seven goods"—good cooperation, good production, good life, good price stability, good cadres, good Party policies, and good socialism.

After the education of "three observations" and "six comparisons," the situation in the whole township completely changed. Whether it was those dissatisfied with the cooperative or those who wanted to retain more and sell less grain, they all corrected their understanding of the country and the cooperative. The whole township's 50,000 jin grain purchase task was pledged by all cooperatives to be fully completed. (Reprinted from Shaanxi Daily)

    做思想工作
    陕西省西乡县沙河乡在夏收分配中，发现社员对国家利益和合作化的优越性，普遍缺乏正确的认识。例如一些社员嫌留粮标准低，主张多分少扣少卖余粮；一些富裕中农看到社里的缺点，便对入社也动摇了；少数农民忘记旧社会的痛苦，对新社会要求过高，甚至看不到新社会的好处。党支部针对这种思想病症，组织了一百六十多人的一支宣传队伍，到处召开座谈会，登门访问，向社员作“三看”、“六比”的教育。
    什么是“三看”呢？
    一看工人阶级对农民的支援。他们组织农民由近到远的座谈，看到了工人支援农民的事实。民主社第四队二十六户，去年吃盐一千一百多斤，扯洋布三十七丈，买镰刀、锄头一百一十三件，还有化肥、农药等。大家还指出西镇路上跑的汽车，乡上装的电话，都是工人支援农民的东西。原来有人说：“没有农民生产，工人就得饿着肚子”。现在说法变啦：“我们是些近视眼，只看见自己的作用，看不见工人老大哥的伟大。”
    二看国家对农民的帮助。民主社在座谈中算了一笔账，今年光国家贷款、救济等款就有一千七百多元，折合稻谷三万五千七百多斤。可是，夏季征购粮任务，才有一万五千斤。这么一算，社员们说：“国家对我们帮助多大啊！”
    三看合作化的优越性。是不是入社不如出社呢？各社在座谈中也肯定了这个问题。民主社去年转成高级社后，人力物力财力集中了，他们补修起七口塘，扩大灌溉面积一百二十多亩，光这一项就增产八万四千多斤粮。增产多，社员们都增加了收入，无依无靠的人也得到“五保”。大家谈到这些事实，谁也不再三心二意了。
    什么是“六比”呢？一比社会制度，二比生产好坏，三比生活好坏，四比人口增加、人民消费的提高和生产赶不上需要，五比文化教育，六比干部作风。这“六比”都是跟解放前比，跟前几年比较。大家在比的过程中，通过自己的生动具体事实，进一步认清国家和自己幸福生活的关系。贫农宋怀珍说：“旧社会是一恶、二霸、三敲、四打、五拉兵、六支夫、苛捐杂税，逼得人没活路。”谈到现在，大家总结起来说，“五有”——人民有自由，生产有地种，社会有秩序，人人有衣穿，人人有饭吃；“六没”——没剥削，没土匪，没烟鬼，没赌博，没苛捐杂税，没饿死人；“七好”——合作好，生产好，生活好，物价稳定好，干部好，党的政策好，社会主义好。
    经过“三看”、“六比”教育，全乡的情况完全变啦。不论是对社不满的人，或想多留少卖粮的人，都端正了对国家和社的认识。全乡五万斤征购粮食任务，各社表示要全部完成。（转载陕西日报）
