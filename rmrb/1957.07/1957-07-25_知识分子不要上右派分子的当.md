Intellectuals, Don't Be Fooled by Right-Wingers
Gao Chengzhuang, Associate Professor, Sichuan College of Finance and Economics

I.

Intellectuals are not a class. As far as the current situation in China is concerned, intellectuals can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is the intellectuals of the working class, and the other part is the intellectuals of the bourgeoisie. The former is currently a minority, while the latter accounts for the vast majority of Chinese intellectuals. Therefore, the issue of Chinese intellectuals at present is mainly the issue of bourgeois intellectuals (or old intellectuals). It is a matter of how the Chinese Communist Party unites, educates, and transforms these intellectuals so that the vast number of Chinese old intellectuals can better adapt to the needs of the new society and better serve the construction of our socialist society.

There are different views on this issue at present. A few right-wingers with ulterior motives, in order to seize the leadership of intellectuals from the working class and the Communist Party, and in order to confuse and use intellectuals, have distorted the essence of the current issue of Chinese intellectuals. For example, Luo Longji said: The current issue of Chinese intellectuals is the issue of petty-bourgeois small intellectuals versus petty-bourgeois big intellectuals. This is a vicious distortion and instigation by right-wing ambitious people on the issue of intellectuals. Luo Longji tried to create a misperception among intellectuals, and I think his main intentions are twofold:

1. He described the Communist Party's leadership of intellectuals as a matter of intellectuals leading intellectuals, and the Communist Party's leadership of intellectuals, mainly political and ideological leadership, as if it were only a matter of professional leadership, thereby attempting to conceal or obliterate the historical task of intellectuals today—to serve workers and peasants.
2. He described the Communist Party's leadership of intellectuals as the leadership of small intellectuals over large intellectuals, thereby attempting to prove that the Communist Party cannot lead intellectuals, in order to achieve the sinister goal of right-wing elements to overthrow the Party's leadership.

Apart from right-wing ambitious people, the vast majority of intellectuals are willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and support the Communist Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals.

Many people like to talk about the characteristics of intellectuals. I think that in a class society, under the conditions of the separation of manual and mental labor, intellectuals have their own characteristics compared to workers, peasants, and other manual laborers. At present, Chinese old intellectuals, in terms of their education, ideology, worldview, and class attributes, basically belong to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. However, I also admit that Chinese old intellectuals who came from semi-colonial and semi-feudal society are deeply influenced by Chinese feudal society. From this point of view, Chinese old intellectuals are not exactly the same as intellectuals in more developed capitalist countries (such as Britain and the United States). It is not impossible to say that they have some characteristics. If we say that Chinese old intellectuals have such a situation, that they simultaneously possess feudal (still relatively deep in some people), comprador, bourgeois, as well as patriotic and socialist ideas, therefore, the Party should, when implementing the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, start from the specific situation and existing level of intellectuals, be good at enlightening, guiding, patiently helping, and appropriately encouraging the progress of intellectuals, I admit it. As far as the overall situation is concerned, the Party's past practices towards intellectuals have been basically like this. However, from the perspective of Chinese old intellectuals themselves, what we call some characteristics are still our own weaknesses and shortcomings, and not advantages as some people say. Right-wing elements exaggerate these so-called characteristics for ulterior motives. These are exactly what we should strive to get rid of rather than strive to preserve. Because it is precisely these so-called characteristics of intellectuals that hinder our progress and prevent us from transforming ourselves faster and better to adapt to the needs of the new society.

II.

Some people say: One of the characteristics of Chinese old intellectuals is: aloof and retiring, unwilling to be obsequious. In the past, what they demanded of emperors was to "treat scholars with courtesy" and "visit the thatched cottage three times," and they were unwilling to "recommend themselves like Mao Sui."

To put it more clearly, they believe that Chinese old intellectuals are not so keen on becoming officials. If the rulers want them to come out and become officials, they must invite them with a certain amount of politeness, otherwise they will not go. If they "perform actively," like Mao Sui, recommending themselves, they should be ashamed of it. Not only that, if they are promoted but recommend the wrong person, such as Shang Yang seeking an audience with Duke Xiao of Qin through Jing Jian (eunuch), and Sima Xiangru being known to Emperor Wu of Han through the recommendation of a fellow villager who worked as a "dog supervisor" (an official in charge of the emperor's hunting dogs), it is shameful. This is the so-called way of entering and leaving officialdom for old intellectuals. Old intellectuals often boast about this, thinking it is the "aloofness" of intellectuals.

Generally speaking, in feudal society, Chinese old intellectuals were the intellectuals of the feudal landlord class, serving the rule of the feudal dynasty. Their basic path to serving the ruling class was the system of raising scholars by princes in the Warring States period, the policies, recommendations of filial piety and integrity, and entering the Imperial College in the Han Dynasty, the recommendation of erudite and broad-minded scholars in the Tang Dynasty, and the imperial examination system in the Song Dynasty and below, and so on. The vast majority of intellectuals became officials through these systems. Although the story of visiting the thatched cottage three times has been praised in Chinese history, after all, only Zhuge Liang received such treatment. For example, Liu Xiu also had a similar situation of condescending to ask for advice from Yan Guang, but this situation was always in the minority. The vast number of old Chinese intellectuals, in the thousands of years of Chinese history, did not feel alienated from the monarch because they were not "visited in the thatched cottage three times," and did not serve the feudal dynasty. This situation, I think, compared with Shang Yang who was seen by Jing Jian, Sima Xiangru who was promoted by the dog supervisor, and Mao Sui who recommended himself (by the way, Lord Pingyuan Zhao Sheng raised thousands of scholars, but in the end only Mao Sui was somewhat useful), their "aloofness" is also extremely limited. This is the basic path of Chinese old intellectuals in feudal society, and it can also be said to be a tradition, because the vast majority of them did so in fact. Although many people were singing the tune of "aloofness" while being officials, this is self-deception and is not worthy of emulation. Naturally, there were also some hermits in Chinese history, either because they were squeezed out and could not be used greatly, or because they were not known and appreciated, or because they were fishing for fame, or because they were protecting themselves, etc., and did not directly serve the ruling class, but they all had the conditions to enjoy the pastoral life and live an exploitative parasitic life.

Since old China was reduced to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, some "people with lofty ideals" who "cherished the great ambition of saving the country and the people" appeared among intellectuals, and many revolutionary intellectuals also appeared, but the vast majority of old intellectuals served imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism.

After the founding of New China, workers and peasants became the ruling class for the first time in Chinese history. Some old intellectuals could not turn their minds around for a while, and were unwilling to "condescend" to today's ruling class and its cadres and political parties, and demanded that others "condescend." In this rectification movement, some people called those who actively approached the Communist Party "opportunists," as if it were "aloof" not to be willing to approach the people and not to be willing to take an active supporting attitude towards the people's cause. What is especially strange is that some people who were officials in the old society are now talking about their "aloofness and retirement" in front of the people, unwilling to "associate with" the Communist Party.

I think that serving workers and peasants today, and approaching workers and peasants is the most aloof thing, which is fundamentally different from the "opportunism" of serving the reactionary ruling class and approaching the reactionary ruling class in the past. This is not only because this cause is just, but also because this relationship is new and revolutionary. Therefore, as the People's Daily editorial said, today it should be said that it is the intellectuals who should visit the thatched cottage three times, and the people should be Zhuge Liang ("On the Question of Standpoint Again").

Some people say: One of the characteristics of Chinese old intellectuals is: scholars can be killed but not humiliated. Because they have a strong sense of self-esteem, "reputation" is "more important than life" to them.

It should be admitted that intellectuals in old China had a considerable status. In the era of feudal dynasties, intellectuals in the court were naturally famous and prominent, both rich and noble, and even those who retired to the countryside were respected in one area. Even the "students" who were still studying also had a certain influence. For example, the imperial edict of the tenth year of Shunzhi in the Qing Dynasty wrote: "Recently, I heard that some students in various prefectures and counties are illiterate, ... even going in and out of government offices, colluding with officials, seizing land, and arbitrarily deciding on township advancements. The place where the country raises scholars is filled with the hiding and harboring of dirt for such people..." Naturally, we cannot say that all intellectuals in feudal society were so rampant and domineering, oppressing the countryside. There were also some who were relatively clean and self-preserving, but the special social and political status of the feudal landlord class was the fundamental reason why their intellectuals were respected. In feudal society, who said that the working people could not be humiliated? There was no such saying. "Scholars" could not be humiliated, which was cultivated for thousands of years. But seriously speaking, the scholar-official class in feudal society was not inviolable either. In the past, feudal emperors treated their own servants with great courtesy on the one hand, and on the other hand, they would humiliate them if they were slightly dissatisfied. It was not just Liu Bang who "took off his hat and urinated in it" (Records of the Historian, Biography of Li Sheng and Lu Jia: "Duke Pei did not like Confucianism. When guests came wearing Confucian hats, Duke Pei would take off their hats and urinate in them."). From Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty onwards, the punishment of court rods was established, and even ministers could not avoid flogging and humiliation, and some even died on the spot (such as Xia Xiang, Minister of Public Works), which is a relatively prominent example. Other dynasties also humiliated their servants quite severely in terms of criminal law (such as castration) and court etiquette.

After liberation, although Chinese intellectuals lost their special status in the past, they were also liberated from their humiliating status for the first time and, together with the working people, truly gained human dignity. Today, it can be said that any upright citizen cannot be humiliated. It is undeniable that a few people do not see it that way. Some people think that ideological reform is humiliating, and some people think that being investigated in the anti-rightist movement is humiliating. That is why some people put forward the saying "scholars can be killed but not humiliated." I think this needs to be analyzed specifically. If we say that ideological reform and the anti-rightist movement have exposed the bottom line of old intellectuals (whether ideological or political history) in front of a small number of people, and they feel very uncomfortable, this is understandable for general intellectuals, but it is wrong to regard this as a kind of humiliation. Ideological reform is a necessary means to resolve contradictions among the people through criticism and self-criticism, and it is an important method to help people establish their own correct worldview and outlook on life. This was not only necessary in the past, but will also be necessary in the future. Publicly criticizing and abandoning one's own erroneous thoughts in front of the masses is precisely the way to be an upright person. Can this be said to be a kind of humiliation? If you think that being investigated in the anti-rightist movement is a distrust of yourself, and therefore think it is an insult to yourself, this is also wrong. The anti-rightist movement is a serious class struggle and political struggle. It is entirely necessary for the consolidation of one's own country, the political purity of the revolutionary camp, and to put oneself and the country in a normal relationship. What is humiliating about clarifying one's own problems, and gaining the trust of the Party and the people as a result of struggle and investigation?

Some people say: One of the characteristics of Chinese old intellectuals is: scholars are used by those who know them, or even die for those who know them.

I think that if "scholars die for those who know them" is completely devoid of class analysis, regardless of right and wrong content, and purely looks at the issue from the perspective of personal gratitude, it is not worthy of emulation.

Today, the Chinese people's demand for Chinese intellectuals to serve socialism not only puts Chinese old intellectuals on the right path for the first time, but also can be said to be the first time that Chinese old intellectuals have met true "confidants." Because of our country's arduous socialist construction cause, which requires as many intellectuals as possible to serve it, the Party and the people trust intellectuals who are truly willing to serve the socialist cause, help them solve various necessary problems, so that they can actively exert their talents. Chinese intellectuals have never been so known and appreciated by the people as they are today, which should be a source of joy and encouragement for intellectuals.

Intellectuals who are accustomed to looking at problems from a personal perspective often feel that they are not known and appreciated because some of their personal wishes have not been achieved, which I think is wrong. This should be reflected upon oneself. Today, the ideological state and professional level of old intellectuals are not commensurate with the social and political status of intellectuals. If we demand that the Party and the people solve problems not according to the interests of the revolution but according to their own interests, not according to the wishes of 600 million people but according to their own wishes, and think that this is the "confidant" of intellectuals, then that is wrong and impossible to achieve.

III.

In this rectification movement, a few right-wing ambitious people openly or relatively covertly published a series of anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and at the same time carried out various organized, planned, and strategic conspiracy activities. Now it seems that the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements have a certain market among intellectuals, and some intellectuals have participated in the conspiracy activities of right-wing elements to varying degrees. Some people say: Chinese intellectuals are "choosing the good and adhering to it." I want to ask now: Where has the sense of right and wrong of the intellectuals who "choose the good and adhere to it" gone? When the right-wingers were frantically attacking the Party, the facts proved that the ability of some intellectuals to distinguish between right and wrong on major issues related to the fate of the country was not high, and some were obviously wavering. From this, it can be seen that if Chinese old intellectuals do not strengthen ideological reform and clearly shift their stand, it is impossible to "choose the good and adhere to it" so easily.

Right-wing elements used various means to confuse intellectuals for their despicable political ambitions. They used flowery words to praise intellectuals, saying how many advantages (or characteristics) intellectuals have. It is now very clear that they are pouring poison and releasing rotten medicine to intellectuals. Their real intention is to pull intellectuals back so that they can be used as their pawns to achieve their sinister goal of restoring capitalism in China. Many people have now woken up. We intellectuals should have a correct estimate of ourselves. Overestimating or underestimating ourselves will bring harm to our own progress and the cause of socialist construction.

I think that our old intellectuals should deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings to us, strengthen our self-transformation, continue to move forward, and not stop halfway, let alone retreat backwards, because there is no way out for retreating.

    知识分子不要上右派分子的当
    四川财经学院副教授　高成庄
    一
    知识分子不是一个阶级。就目前中国的情况来说，知识分子大体可以分为两部分：一部分是工人阶级的知识分子，一部分是资产阶级的知识分子。前一部分在目前是少数，而后一部分在目前中国知识分子中则占绝大多数。因此，中国知识分子问题，在目前，主要是资产阶级知识分子（或称旧知识分子）的问题，是中国共产党如何团结、教育、改造这些知识分子，以便使广大的中国旧知识分子能够更好地适应新社会的需要、更好地为建设我国社会主义社会服务的问题。
    对于这样一个问题，在目前有不同的看法。少数别有用心的右派，为了从工人阶级、共产党手中夺取对知识分子的领导权，为了迷惑和利用知识分子，把目前中国知识分子问题的实质歪曲了。例如罗隆基就这样说过：目前中国知识分子的问题是无产阶级小知识分子对小资产阶级大知识分子的问题。这是右派野心家在知识分子问题上恶毒的歪曲和挑拨离间。罗隆基企图在知识分子当中造成错觉，我以为其主要用意有二：
    1．他把共产党领导知识分子的问题说成是知识分子领导知识分子的问题，把共产党对知识分子的领导主要是政治、思想领导关系说成似乎只是业务领导关系，从而想掩盖或抹掉知识分子今天的历史任务——为工人、农民服务。
    2．他把共产党对知识分子的领导说成是小知识分子对大知识分子的领导，从而企图证明共产党不能领导知识分子，以达到右派分子推翻党的领导的罪恶目的。
    除开右派野心家以外，在知识分子中绝大多数人都是愿意接受共产党领导的，都是拥护共产党对知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策的。
    许多人喜欢谈知识分子的特点。我以为，在阶级社会，在体力劳动和脑力劳动分离的社会条件下，知识分子，对工人、农民及其他体力劳动者来说，是有其特点的。目前中国旧知识分子，从其所受教育、思想意识、世界观，以及阶级属性来说，基本上属于资产阶级知识分子的范畴。但是，我也承认，从半殖民地半封建社会来的中国旧知识分子受中国封建社会的影响较深。从这一方面来看，中国旧知识分子和比较发达的资本主义国家（例如英、美）的知识分子不完全相同，说它有一些特点，也未尝不可。如果说，中国旧知识分子有这样一些情况，在他们的身上同时具有封建的（在某些人的身上还比较深）、买办的、资产阶级的以及爱国主义的、社会主义的思想，因此，党在执行团结、教育、改造知识分子政策的时候，应该从知识分子的具体情况、现有水平出发，对知识分子的进步善于启发、诱导、耐心帮助和适当的鼓励，我是承认的。就整个情况来讲，过去党对知识分子的作法，基本上也是如此的。但是，从中国旧知识分子自己来说，我们所谓的一些特点，也还是我们自己的弱点、缺点，而不是如有些人所说的是优点。右派分子为了不可告人的目的，还特别夸大这些所谓特点。这些正是我们应该努力去掉而不是应该努力保存起来的。因为正是这些所谓知识分子的特点阻碍了我们的进步，妨碍我们更快、更好地改造自己来适应新社会的需要。
    二
    有人说：中国旧知识分子的特点之一是：清高恬退，不愿逢迎。他们过去要求于帝王的是要“礼贤下士”，“三顾茅庐”，而不愿意“毛遂自荐”。
    说清楚一点就是，他们认为，中国旧知识分子并不是那末热中于做官的，如果统治者要他们出来做官，必须有一定的礼貌来邀请才去，否则是不去的。如果自己“表现积极”，像毛遂那样，自己推荐自己，是应该引以为耻的。不仅如此，如果进身而推荐不得其人，如商鞅因景监（宦官）以求见孝公（秦），司马相如因一个作“狗监”（为皇帝主管猎犬之官）的同乡人的推荐而得知于汉武帝，都是可耻的。这是旧知识分子所谓的出处之道。旧知识分子往往以此夸耀，认为这是知识分子的“清高”。
    总的说来，在封建社会，中国旧知识分子是封建地主阶级的知识分子，是为封建王朝统治服务的。他们为统治阶级服务的基本道路，在战国时代是王公的养士制度，在汉是对策、举孝廉方正、入太学，在唐是举博学宏词，在宋以下是科举制度等等。绝大多数的知识分子是通过这样一些制度做官的。三顾茅庐的故事虽然在中国历史上传为美谈，受过这样待遇的毕竟只有一个诸葛亮。如刘秀对于严光也有类似移尊就教情况，但这种情况总是少数。广大的旧中国知识分子，在中国历史上几千年来，并没有因为自己没有被“三顾臣于草庐之中”而见外于君王，而不为封建王朝服务。这种情况，我以为比之因景监见的商鞅，因狗监进的司马相如和自荐的毛遂（顺便说一句，平原君赵胜养士数千人，到头来还是只有毛遂一人中用些），其“清高”也是极其有限的。这是中国旧知识分子在封建社会的基本道路，也可以说是一种传统，因为他们中的绝大多数人在事实上是这样做了的。尽管许多人一边在做官，一边在唱“清高”调子，这是自欺欺人，是不足为训的。自然，在中国历史上也有一些隐逸之士，或是因为受到排挤，不得大用，或是因为不受知遇，或是因为钓名取誉，或是因为明哲保身等等，没有直接为统治阶级服务，但是他们大家都是有条件乐享田园，过着剥削寄生生活的。
    自旧中国沦为半殖民地半封建社会以来，在知识分子中出现了一些“怀抱救国救民之大志”的“志士仁人”，也出现了许多革命的知识分子，但绝大多数旧知识分子则是为帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义服务的。
    新中国成立以后，工人、农民在中国历史上第一次成为统治阶级。一部分旧知识分子思想上一时转不过来，对今天的统治阶级及其干部和政党，不愿自己“屈尊”，而要求别人“俯就”。在这次整风运动中，有人对积极靠拢共产党的人称为“趋炎附势之徒”，好像自己不愿和人民靠拢，对人民的事业不愿采取积极支持的态度才算“清高”似的。尤其可怪的是，一些在旧社会作过官吏的人，今天在人民面前却大谈其“清高恬退”，不愿和共产党“同流合污”了。
    我以为，今天为工人、农民服务，和工人、农民靠拢是最清高不过的，这和过去向反动统治阶级服务，向反动统治阶级靠拢的“趋炎附势”是有原则区别的。这不仅是因为这一事业是正义的，而且这一关系也是新的、革命的关系。因此，诚如人民日报社论所说，在今天更应该说三顾茅庐的是知识分子，而人民更应该是诸葛亮才对（“再论立场问题”）。
    有人说：中国旧知识分子的特点之一是：士可杀而不可辱。因为他们有强烈的自尊心，“名誉”对于他们，是“重于生命”的。
    应该承认，知识分子在旧中国是颇有地位的。在封建王朝时代，在朝的知识分子固然是扬名显亲，既富且贵，即退而在野也是望重一方，受人尊敬的。甚至还在读书的“生员”，也有一定的势力。例如清顺治十年上谕写道：“比闻各州府县生员有不通文义，……甚者出入衙门，交结官府，霸占土地，武断乡进，国家养士之地，充为此辈藏垢纳污之所。……”自然，我们不能说，在封建社会，所有的知识分子都如此横行霸道，鱼肉乡里，其中也有一些比较洁身自好之士，但是封建地主阶级的特殊社会地位和政治地位是他们的知识分子受人尊敬的根本原因。在封建社会，有谁说过，劳动人民是侮辱不得的么？这种说法是没有的“士”是侮辱不得的，这是几千年培养起来的。但认真说来，在封建社会的士大夫阶级也并不是不可以侮辱的。过去封建帝王对他自己的臣仆一方面是优礼有加，另一方面也是稍不合意就要加以侮辱的，岂仅一个“取其冠而溲之”的刘邦而已（史记郦生陆贾列传：“沛公不好儒，诸客冠儒冠来者，沛公辄解其冠，溲溺其中。”）。明朝从太祖始，设廷林之刑，虽大臣不免笞辱，甚者立毙杖下（如工部尚书夏祥），是比较突出的例子。其他王朝对其臣仆在刑法（如宫刑）和朝仪上，侮辱得也是够厉害的。
    解放以后，中国的知识分子虽然丧失了过去的特殊地位，但是也第一次从屈辱的地位中解放出来，和劳动人民一道，真正地取得了人的尊严。在今天，才可以说，任何正直的公民，都是不可以侮辱的。不可否认，有少数人并不如此看法。有人认为思想改造是屈辱，也有人认为在肃反运动中被审查是屈辱。因此才有人提出“士可杀而不可辱”的说法。我以为，这须要具体分析。如果说，思想改造和肃反运动把旧知识分子的底子（不管是思想的或政治历史的）在一小部分人的面前揭开了，感到很不习惯，这在一般知识分子来说都是可以理解的，但如果把这看作是一种屈辱就不对了。思想改造是通过批评与自我批评来解决人民内部矛盾的必要手段，是帮助人们树立自己正确的世界观和人生观的重要方法。这不仅过去是必要的，在今后也还是必要的。在群众面前把自己的错误思想公开批判并加以抛弃，正是光明磊落的作人之道。这难道能说是一种侮辱么？如果认为自己在肃反运动中被审查，是对自己的不信任，因而认为是对自己的侮辱，这也是不对的。肃反，是严肃的阶级斗争和政治斗争。为了自己祖国的巩固，革命阵营在政治上的纯洁，以及把自己和祖国放在正常的关系上，这完全是必要的。斗争和审查的结果，把自己的问题搞清楚了，得到党和人民的信任，何辱之有？
    有人说：中国旧知识分子的特点之一是：士为知己者用，甚或士为知己者死。
    我认为“士为知己者死”如果完全不从阶级分析着眼，不管是非内容，纯粹从个人报恩观点来看问题，是不足为法的。
    今天中国人民要求中国知识分子为社会主义服务，不仅使中国旧知识分子第一次走上正确的道路，而且也可以说是中国旧知识分子第一次遇到了真正的“知己”。由于我国艰巨的社会主义建设事业，需要尽可能多的知识分子为它服务，所以，党和人民对凡是真正愿意为社会主义事业服务的知识分子给予信任，帮助他们解决各种必须解决的问题，使他们得以积极地发挥他们的才能。中国知识分子从来也没有像今天这样受知于人民，这对知识分子来说，是应该感觉欢欣鼓舞的。
    习惯于从个人角度看问题的知识分子，往往因为一些个人的愿望没有达到，而感到自己不受知遇，我以为是不应该的。这应该反求诸己。在今天，旧知识分子的思想状态和业务水平，对知识分子的社会地位和政治地位来说是不相称的。如果要求党和人民不是按照革命的利益而是按照自己的利益来解决问题，不是按照六亿人民的愿望而是按照自己的愿望来解决问题，认为这样才是知识分子的知己，那就是不应该，也是不可能办到的。
    三
    在这次整风运动中，少数右派野心家公开地或比较隐蔽地发表了一系列的反党、反社会主义的言论，同时还进行了有组织、有计划、有策略的各种阴谋活动。现在看来，右派分子的反动言论在知识分子中是有一定市场的，右派分子的阴谋活动一部分知识分子还在不同程度上参加了的。有人说：中国知识分子是“择善而固执”的。我现在要问：“择善而固执”的知识分子的是非观念到那里去了？当右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，事实证明一部分知识分子对关系国家命运的大是大非的辨别能力是不高的，有些是显然动摇的，由此可见，中国旧知识分子如果不加强思想改造，明确地把立场转变过来，是不可能那么容易地“择善而固执”的。
    右派分子为了可鄙的政治野心，使用了各种手段来迷惑知识分子。他们用花言巧语来捧知识分子，说知识分子有多少多少优点（或特点）。现在已经十分明白，他们是在向知识分子灌毒酒、放烂药。他们的真正用意是在想把知识分子拉向后退，以便作为他们的爪牙，来达到他们把资本主义在中国复辟的罪恶目的。目前许多人已经醒悟过来了。我们知识分子应该对自己有正确的估计，过高或过低估计自己，都将给我们自己的进步和社会主义建设事业带来害处。
    我以为，我们旧知识分子应该深入体会毛主席对我们的教导，加强改造自己，继续前进，不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。　（原载7月9日四川日报）
