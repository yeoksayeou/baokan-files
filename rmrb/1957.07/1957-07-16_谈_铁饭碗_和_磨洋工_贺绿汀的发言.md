Talking about "Iron Rice Bowl" and "Goldbricking"
He Luting's Speech

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country have united and worked together to build our new country. After eight years, there has been astonishing development in all aspects of economy and culture, and the lives of the people of the whole country have also been greatly improved. Everyone deeply feels from the bottom of their hearts that socialism is really good. But what exactly is the true meaning of socialism? I think a considerable number of people are not very clear about it. I have found that many people have a wrong idea about socialism, thinking that socialism is merely everyone having food to eat.

Many People in Government Organizations and Groups are "Goldbricking" While Relying on Socialism

The purpose of socialism should be to ensure that everyone has food to eat. This statement is not wrong. Our government always tries its best to provide relief for labor employment, the widowed and lonely, natural disasters, etc. It takes special care of those who have contributed to the revolution and various aspects of social, economic, and cultural development, especially senior intellectuals. Until recently, Chairman Mao was still telling us: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people, and we must never forget this."

But in order to achieve everyone having food to eat, all of us must work hard to produce. To encourage production, we must pay according to labor. People with labor power should not be allowed to gain without working. This is the basic principle of socialism.

It should be admitted that the current rural areas and factories basically pay according to labor. In advanced agricultural cooperatives in rural areas, you cannot get work points without working. In factories, wages are also deducted if you don't work (labor discipline is still not good in some factories). However, in the vast government organizations, groups, and some schools, it is not so strict. On the one hand, the vast majority of people work hard, but on the other hand, some people do not work hard. Of course, there are also cases where the allocation of work is inappropriate, or work is not well arranged. But there are also those who are unwilling to work, or even lie on socialism and gain without working.

Sun Dayu, a rightist in Shanghai, receives a monthly salary of more than 300 yuan, lives in a first-class apartment on the eighteenth floor for free, specializes in scolding people, falsely accuses good people of being counter-revolutionaries, specializes in opposing the Communist Party, and does bad things, and it seems that no one can do anything about him. This is the most typical example.

Luo Longji is unwilling to manage wood and wants to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The wood for 600 million people is no small matter. The table and chairs he uses in his own house cannot be separated from wood. The people entrusted him with the fate of the wood related to 600 million people, but he looks down on it. He must show his face and enter and exit diplomatic occasions to feel invigorated. I think the people are not fools. Entrusting the fate of the new China, which was exchanged for the blood of thousands of martyrs, to such an American-made so-called "diplomat" will lead to the loss of thousands of lives again in the future.

The ministers of socialist countries are supposed to do things, not to be officials. Luo Longji is unwilling to manage wood, and we can also be sure that he has never managed wood, but has been busy forming the Zhang-Luo Alliance and doing many unspeakable things.

These rightists are not just lying on socialism, but are engaged in conspiracies to overthrow socialism. But it cannot be said that the thoughts of those who lie on socialism have no connection with these rightists. Officials have high and low positions, and positions have large and small sizes. The exploitative ideology of being unwilling to serve the people but trying to stand above the people and gain without working is the same.

The current situation has some things that deserve our attention. The old system has been abolished, and the new system has not been completely established. Personnel in any school, government organization, or group can only enter but not leave, so there are still loopholes to exploit. Work depends entirely on one's own political consciousness to guarantee. No one can force those who are unwilling to work hard. A person works very well during the three-month probationary period, but as soon as they are officially employed, they slack off, reach out for housing, subsidies, and ask for this and that, and make trouble; this is not an isolated case. As a result, the heads of schools, groups, and Party committees are busy with these administrative tasks, busy with persuasion and education, and resolving personnel disputes. But they still cannot persuade these people to fully exert their work enthusiasm. The general situation is that the higher the treatment, the better, and the less work, the better. Therefore, in order to ensure work, they have to increase personnel, which is followed by the continuous expansion and bloating of institutions and the continuous reduction of work efficiency. In order to overcome this vicious expansion, the government has to order a personnel freeze. Then, some people who urgently need to come in cannot come in, while those who are not suitable for the work of the unit cannot leave. As a result, much of the work is in a state of paralysis. The most important purpose of schools, groups, and government organizations is to do things for the people. If things are not done well, it will bring the most serious losses to the country and the people. I believe that it is irresponsible to the people to take care of individual backwardness and let these people who lie on socialism "goldbrick" every day without dealing with them.

In our society, the vast majority of people are working solemnly for our beautiful future, but there are also a few people who are not enthusiastic, and some who gain without working, and of course, there are also rightists. These negative factors that exist in our great era can be found everywhere. I think we should study their roots and overcome them.

Premier Zhou said in the Government Work Report: "Our various systems and organizational forms must be constantly improved with the objective situation, otherwise, they will not be adapted to the economic base, will not serve the economic base, and may even hinder economic development." At present, in government organizations, groups, and schools, we think very carefully about meeting the needs of all aspects of life. Some foreign guests said after visiting: "In your unit, except for the court, you have everything." However, to ensure the completion of work tasks, there is no mandatory method other than persuasion and education. This is the root cause of lying on socialism. It doesn't matter whether you work or not, it's an "iron rice bowl" anyway.

Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In order to carry out production and study effectively and to live in an orderly way, the people require their government, the leaders of production, and the leaders of cultural and educational institutions to issue various appropriate mandatory administrative orders. Without such administrative orders, social order cannot be maintained, which is understood by common sense. This is a complementary aspect to using the method of persuasion and education to resolve contradictions among the people."

I think this passage has extremely important significance for how to establish a new socialist work system. We lack strict systems to ensure work efficiency, and we often cannot correctly grasp the formula of unity-struggle-unity in persuasion and education. Especially after the policy on senior intellectuals came, the formula itself changed to unity, unity, and unity, without struggle. Things become even more difficult to handle.

We Need Both Persuasion and Education and Various Sound Work Systems

Establishing a new system is certainly not easy, nor is it a task that can be accomplished overnight, but it has reached a point of urgent need. I don't think the current "iron rice bowl" system is a good method. Whether it is a government organization, group, or school, it is a combat unit for building socialism, not a mere welfare institution. Appropriate people must be placed in appropriate units to make the best use of their talents. People who are not suitable for certain jobs or are incompetent should not be permanently frozen there. Therefore, the person in charge of a unit should have a certain degree of discretion in personnel management in order to ensure the completion of work tasks.

Before liberation, school teachers were all bound by contracts. If they did not teach well, the school had the right not to renew their contracts after the term expired. Therefore, teachers worked responsibly. In the Soviet Union, university teachers have a comprehensive assessment every four years, and only those who pass can continue to work. And there are certain systems for teacher promotion and scientific research.

Therefore, in order to ensure the improvement of work efficiency in all government organizations, groups, and schools, there must be certain labor discipline, and appropriate consideration should be given to adopting methods such as employment contracts, or taking a periodic comprehensive assessment system like the Soviet Union.

There should be a certain attendance system, rewards for good work, and disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for those who do not work well and refuse to correct their behavior after repeated warnings. There is no difference to the overall social labor and employment problem if a person who does not work well loses their job and is replaced by another unemployed person who does good work. On the contrary, it educates everyone that they cannot joke about their profession and can only work hard. A person who does not work well temporarily experiencing the pain of unemployment is often more effective than heartfelt persuasion and education. At the same time, those who are not suitable for work in place A are suitable for place B; this can also prevent talents from being over-concentrated and unable to fully发挥their role.

In order to ensure that everyone's work ability is fully exerted to build our country, setting certain systems and labor discipline does not mean that we do not need social relief and due care. This is precisely one of the important attributes of socialism. We must find ways to provide relief for natural disasters and people who have lost their labor power, and we should take care of those who have contributed to the revolution and social, cultural, and scientific undertakings. However, work and relief or care should be separated; at the same time, relief or care should preferably have a certain clear system. Mixing them with work will inevitably affect each other.

This issue is more complex and involves a wide range of aspects, and has a great relationship with our socialist economic and cultural construction. Therefore, I suggest that our Party and government leaders and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress carefully consider this issue, refer to the practices of fraternal countries, and formulate preliminary plans. At the same time, socialist labor ideology education should be carried out nationwide, so that everyone realizes that lying on socialism and gaining without working is an exploitative ideology and a shameful behavior. We must rely on the labor and creativity of the people of the whole country to build our beautiful socialist motherland.

My opinions may be one-sided or incorrect. I hope the delegates will correct me.

### 谈“铁饭碗”和“磨洋工”  贺绿汀的发言

    谈“铁饭碗”和“磨洋工”
    贺绿汀的发言
    解放以来，在党的正确领导下，全国人民大团结，共同努力建设我们的新国家，八年后的今天，无论在经济、文化各方面，都有了惊人的发展，全国人民的生活也大大的改善了，大家都从心里深深地感觉到社会主义实在好。但是社会主义的真正意义究竟是什么？我看还有相当多数的人不是很明白的，我发现有许多人存在一种对社会主义的错误的观念，认为社会主义仅仅就是大家有饭吃。
    机关团体中有不少人躺在社会主义身上“磨洋工”
    社会主义的目的应该使大家有饭吃，这句话并不算错。我们政府对于劳动就业、鳏寡孤独、自然灾害等等，总是想尽办法救济。而对那些对革命对社会经济文化各方面有过贡献的人特别对高级知识分子照顾得很周到。一直到最近，毛主席还在对我们说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”
    但是我们为了要达到大家有饭吃，就必须所有的人都努力生产，为了鼓励生产，必须按劳取酬，不应该让有劳动力的人不劳而获，这是社会主义的基本原则。
    应该承认目前的农村、工厂基本上是按劳取酬，在农村高级合作社中不劳动是得不到工分的，在工厂不劳动也要扣工资的（有些工厂劳动纪律还不好）。但是在广大的机关团体及一部分学校中就没有那样严格。一方面绝大多数人努力工作，但另一方面也有些人，工作不努力。当然也有分配工作不适当的，或没有很好安排工作的。但是也有不愿意工作的，或甚至躺在社会主义身上，不劳而获。
    上海的右派分子孙大雨，每月三百余元的薪水，白住在居住条件第一等的十八层楼上，专门骂人，诬指好人为反革命，专门反对共产党，作坏事情，似乎没有人可以奈何他。这就是最典型的事例。
    罗隆基不愿意管木头，要当外交部长。六亿人口的木头不是一件小事情，他自己住的房子用的桌子凳子那一样都离不了木头，人民把关系六亿人口的木头的命运交给他，他瞧不起。一定要抛头露面，出入外交场合，才算带劲。我想人民不是傻瓜，把千万先烈的血换来的新中国的命运交给这样一个美国造的所谓“外交家”，将来又会是千万人头落地。
    社会主义国家的部长是要作事情的，不是作官。罗隆基不愿意管木头，我们也可以肯定他没有管过木头，而是专门在那里搞章罗联盟，作了许多不可告人的事情。
    这些右派分子已经不仅是躺在社会主义身上的问题，而是搞阴谋组织要想推翻社会主义。但是也不能说躺在社会主义身上的人与这些右派分子的思想毫无联系。官有高低，位置有大小，不愿意为人民办事而企图站在人民头上、不劳而获的剥削思想是相同的。
    目前情况有些是值得我们注意的，旧制度取消了，新制度没有完全建立起来，任何学校机关团体的人员只有进没有出，因此就还都有空子可钻，工作全凭自己的政治觉悟来保证，不愿意好好工作的人，任何人都无法强制他，一个人在三个月试用期内工作得很不错，一到正式任用就松了劲，伸手要房子、要补贴，要这要那，闹情绪；这样的情况不是个别的。于是学校、团体负责人及党委忙于这些事务工作，忙于说服教育及解决人事纠纷。但仍旧不能说服这些人充分发挥他们的工作积极性，一般情况总是待遇愈高愈好，工作愈少愈好，因而为了保证工作，不得不增加人员，接着来的就是机构不断庞大臃肿，工作效率不断降低。政府为了克服这种恶性膨胀，不得不下令人事冻结，然后一些迫切需要的要进来的人进不来，而那些不适宜于该单位工作的人要出去的也出不去，于是许多的工作都处在瘫痪状态。学校、团体、机关最主要的目的是要为人民办事情，事情办不好，就会给国家人民带来最严重的损失。为了照顾个人落后，而让这些躺在社会主义身上的人天天“磨洋工”，不加以处理，我认为是对人民不负责任的行为。
    在我们的社会里，绝大多数的人民为我们美好的将来庄严地工作着，但也有少数人不带劲的，也有不劳而获的，当然还有右派分子。在我们伟大的时代中所存在的这些消极因素，到处都可以发现的，我认为应该研究其根源加以克服。
    周总理在政府工作报告中说：“我们各方面的制度和组织形式必须随着客观情况而不断改进，否则，就不能同经济基础相适应，不能为经济基础服务，甚至起阻碍经济发展的作用。”目前我们在机关、团体、学校中，对满足各方面生活上的需要想得很周到，有些地方外宾参观了之后说：“在你们这个单位里除了法院之外，什么都有了”，而对于完成工作任务的保证，则除了说服教育之外，没有任何带强制性的办法，这是产生躺在社会主义身上的根源，干不干都没有关系，反正是“铁饭碗”了。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“人民为了有效地进行生产、进行学习和有秩序地过生活，要求自己的政府、生产的领导者、文化教育机关的领导者发布各种适当的带强制性的行政命令。没有这种行政命令，社会秩序就无法维持，这是人们的常识所了解的。这同用说服教育的方法去解决人民内部的矛盾，是相辅相成的两个方面。”
    我认为这一段话对于如何建立新的社会主义工作制度有极其重要的意义。我们在保证工作效率方面既缺少严格的制度，而在说服教育方面往往不能正确掌握团结——斗争——团结的公式。特别是高级知识分子政策一来，公式本身一变而为团结、团结、团结，没有斗争。事情就更难办了。
    既要说服教育更要有各种健全的工作制度
    建立一个新的制度当然不是很容易的，也不是一朝一夕之功，但是已经到了迫切需要的时候了。我认为目前这种“铁饭碗”制度不是好办法。无论机关、团体、学校都是建设社会主义的战斗单位，而不是单纯的照顾机关。必须把适当的人放在适当的单位，方能人尽其才，不应该把不适宜于某种工作的人，或不称职的人永远冻结在那里不动，因此一个单位的负责人为了保证工作任务的完成，对人事的处理应有一定的取舍权。
    在解放以前，学校教师都有聘书约束的，教得不好，期满之后，学校有权可以不续聘。因此教师工作没有不认真负责的。在苏联，大学教师每四年有一次全面考查，合格的方能继续工作。并且在教师的升级及科学研究各方面都有一定的制度。
    因此，为了保证所有机关、团体、学校工作效率的提高，必须有一定的劳动纪律，适当考虑采用聘约合同等等办法，或者像苏联一样采取定期全面考查制度等等。
    应该有一定的考勤制度，好的奖励，对工作不好的人员屡戒不改的可以处分，一直至开除为止。一个工作不好的人失了业，再补上另一个工作好的失业者，对整个的社会劳动就业问题上讲，没有什么差别的，相反地，教育了所有的人，不能向自己的职业开玩笑，只能努力工作。一个工作不好的人暂时尝尝失业的痛苦，往往比苦口婆心的说服教育要灵验得多。同时，不适宜于甲处工作的，适宜于乙处；这样也可以使人才不致于过分集中以至积压不能更充分发挥作用。
    为了保证充分发挥每个人的工作能力来建设我们的国家，定出一定的制度与劳动纪律，不等于不要社会救济与应有的照顾，这恰恰是社会主义重要属性之一。我们对于自然灾害与失去劳动力的人，必须设法救济，对于那些对革命及社会文化科学事业有贡献有成就的人应该照顾。但是工作与救济或照顾应该分开来；同时救济或照顾最好也要有一定的明确的制度。与工作混在一起，必致互相影响。
    这个问题是较复杂的，牵涉方面很广，对我们社会主义经济文化建设关系很大。因此我建议我们的党、政领导和人大常委妥善考虑这个问题，参考兄弟国家的办法，定出初步的方案来。同时应该在全国范围进行社会主义的劳动思想教育，要使所有的人认识到躺在社会主义身上不劳而获就是剥削思想，是一种可耻的行为。要依靠全国人民的劳动创造才能建设我们美好的社会主义的祖国。
    我的意见可能片面或不正确，希望代表们指正。
