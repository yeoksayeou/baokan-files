Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 4th: The Indonesian Nationalist Party held a grand celebration in Bandung on the evening of July 3rd to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of its founding.

President Sukarno, one of the founders of the party, delivered a speech at the meeting, asking members of the Nationalist Party to recall the party's original purpose when it was founded thirty years ago, namely, to realize a just and prosperous society, achieve national independence, and launch a revolutionary mass movement. He said that Indonesia must continue to work to eliminate imperialism and colonialism. President Sukarno said that the goal of realizing a just and prosperous society is constant, and to achieve this goal, a bridge is needed, which is the realization of national independence.

Chairman Suwirjo of the Nationalist Party described the history of the Nationalist Party in his speech. He said that populism has always been the doctrine of the Nationalist Party. He believes that Indonesia's construction is progressing slowly because populism has been squeezed out by liberalism.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party was founded on July 3, 1927. It was dissolved in 1931 due to persecution by the Dutch colonial government. In January 1946, several nationalist parties merged to become the current Indonesian Nationalist Party.

    印度尼西亚国民党成立三十周年
    苏加诺要求实现民族独立
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚国民党成立三十周年纪念会3日晚上在万隆隆重举行。
    这个党的创办人之一苏加诺总统在会上发表了演说，要求国民党人回忆三十年前党成立时的宗旨，即实现公正繁荣的社会、实现民族独立和发动革命的群众运动。他说，在印度尼西亚还要继续努力消灭帝国主义和殖民主义。苏加诺总统说，实现公正繁荣的社会这个宗旨是始终不变的，为了实现这个宗旨，需要有一个桥梁，那就是实现民族独立。
    国民党总主席苏维约在讲话中叙述了国民党的历史。他说，平民主义一直是国民党的学说。他认为印度尼西亚的建设进行得很缓慢，是因为平民主义受到了自由主义的排挤。
    印度尼西亚国民党是在1927年7月3日成立的。在1931年由于荷兰殖民政府的迫害，曾经一度解散。在1946年1月，若干民族主义政党又实行合并，成为今天的印度尼西亚国民党。
