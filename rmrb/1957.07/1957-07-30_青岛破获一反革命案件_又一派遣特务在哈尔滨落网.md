Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 29th: The Qingdao Public Security organs recently cracked a "Chinese Freedom Party" counter-revolutionary case.

Lu Jianbao and Tang Fangquan were both employees of the Taixi District Company of the Qingdao Vegetable Company. In May of this year, they secretly organized the "Chinese Freedom Party" counter-revolutionary organization. Lu Jianbao served as the Secretary-General of the "Central Committee of the Chinese Freedom Party," and Tang Fangquan served as a Central Committee Member of the "Chinese Freedom Party" and concurrently as the "Foreign Minister of the Chinese Freedom Party" government,妄想打倒中国共产党，推翻人民民主政权。Lu Jianbao and Tang Fangquan also secretly developed party members in other places and in Qingdao, attempting to establish strongholds in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and other places. They also wanted to steal across the border, abscond overseas,投靠美帝国主义，出卖我军事机密, and attempt to recruit counter-revolutionaries who had fled abroad and reactionary elements among overseas Chinese to establish counter-revolutionary armed forces.

This group of counter-revolutionary elements took advantage of the opportunity of the right-wingers' rampant attacks on the Party and unscrupulously carried out activities, writing a reactionary proclamation titled "Letter to the Compatriots of the Whole Country" in the name of the "Central Committee of the Chinese Freedom Party, the Joint Command of the Freedom Party Central Government Army," preparing to print and distribute it throughout the country. On the night of June 15, just as they were printing the counter-revolutionary proclamation, they were captured by the public security organs, and all their evidence of crimes was seized on the spot.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 29th: The Harbin Public Security Bureau announced today that Zhu Shaoxiang, the leader of the Harbin intelligence group of the "Second Group of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang" sent by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who had been lurking in the library of the Harbin Institute of Technology, has been arrested according to law. In the bedroom of this special agent, evidence of crimes such as secret writing tools and letters to the Hong Kong special agent agency were found. The case is under interrogation.

Zhu Shaoxiang initially confessed that before his arrest, he had used various means to collect a large amount of intelligence on military, political, and economic aspects, and secretly reported it to the Hong Kong special agent agency. Because of his "active" work, he was repeatedly commended by the Hong Kong special agent agency, and he was given supplementary special agent funds.

This special agent, in August 1956, disguised himself as participating in the construction of the motherland and sneaked into Harbin from Hong Kong. He was introduced by the labor department to work in the library of the Harbin Institute of Technology.

    青岛破获一反革命案件
    又一派遣特务在哈尔滨落网
    据新华社济南29日电　青岛市公安机关最近破获了一起“中国自由党”反革命案件。
    吕建保和唐方全都是青岛市蔬菜公司台西区公司的职员，今年5月份他们秘密组织了“中国自由党”反革命组织，吕建保任“中国自由党中央委员会”总书记，唐方全任“中国自由党”中央委员兼“中国自由党”政府外交部长，妄想打倒中国共产党，推翻人民民主政权。吕建保、唐方全还分别在外地和青岛市秘密发展党员，企图在北京、上海、香港等地建立据点。他们还想偷越国境，潜逃海外，投靠美帝国主义，出卖我军事机密，并企图网罗逃往国外的反革命分子和华侨中的反动分子，建立反革命武装。
    这伙反革命分子趁右派分子向党发动猖狂进攻的机会肆无忌惮地活动起来，以“中国自由党中央委员会、自由党中央政府联军司令部”的名义编写了“告全国同胞书”的反动文告，准备印刷向全国各地散发。6月15日夜，正当他们印刷反革命文告的时候，即被公安机关捕获，并当场缴获了他们的全部罪证。
    据新华社哈尔滨29日电　哈尔滨市公安局今天宣布，潜伏在哈尔滨工业大学图书馆的蒋介石集团的派遣特务“国民党中央执行委员会二组”哈尔滨情报组长朱少翔已经依法逮捕。在这个特务分子的卧室中，搜查出了密写用具和香港特务机关联系的信件等罪证。这个案件正在审讯中。
    朱少翔初步供认：在被捕以前，以各种手段搜集了许多军事、政治和经济方面的情报，密告香港的特务机关。因为他工作“积极”，曾多次受到香港特务机关的嘉勉，并给他补充了特务经费。
    这个特务分子在1956年8月，伪装成参加祖国建设的面目，从香港混进哈尔滨，经劳动部门介绍到哈尔滨工业大学图书馆工作的。
