Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th: The U.S. Senate decided on the 16th, by a vote of seventy-one to eighteen, to include the civil rights bill proposed by the Eisenhower administration on the Senate's agenda.

    All eighteen dissenting votes were cast by Democratic senators from Southern states.

    Washington sources believe that this is the first preliminary victory for civil rights legislation in the Senate in eleven years.

    It is reported that Southern senators are attempting to obstruct the civil rights bill by using tactics of indefinite delay in discussion. In view of the opposition from Southern senators, the government will adopt a compromise attitude to dilute the content of the bill.

    According to the current proposal, the main content of this bill is: (1) Authorizing the federal government to seek injunctions or other orders from federal courts to prevent the deprivation of black people's right to vote or other civil rights. Violations of such orders will be treated as criminal cases, and federal judges will conduct trials without a jury, which is usually composed of white people; (2) Prohibit private individuals and officials from interfering with or attempting to interfere with black people's right to vote; (3) Establish a bipartisan committee to investigate complaints about discrimination against black people.

    If this bill can be passed and effectively implemented, it will greatly affect the politics of the Southern states in the United States, because for more than eighty years, due to the deprivation of voting rights of black voters in the South, the racists of the Southern Democratic Party have been able to control the politics of the South.

    It is reported that the reason the Republican government proposed this bill is to win votes in next year's congressional elections and regain control of Congress, which is currently in the hands of the Democratic Party.

    共和党想打击民主党在南方的势力
    美参院决定讨论民权法案
    新华社17日讯  华盛顿消息：美国参议院16日以七十一票对十八票决定把艾森豪威尔政府提出的民权法案列入参议院的议程。
    十八票反对票都是南方各州的民主党参议员投的。
    华盛顿人士认为这是十一年来民权立法第一次在参议院取得初步胜利。
    有消息说，南方参议员企图使用无限期拖延讨论的办法来阻挠民权法案。而政府方面鉴于南方参议员的反对，将采取妥协态度，冲淡法案的内容。
    按照目前的提案，这个法案的主要内容是：（一）授权联邦政府设法使联邦法院颁布禁令或者其他命令，防止剥夺黑人投票权或者其他民权的行为。违反这样的命令的事情将作为违法案件，由联邦法官在没有通常由白人组成的陪审团的情况下进行审判；（二）禁止私人和官员干涉或者企图干涉黑人的投票权；（三）设立一个两党委员会来调查关于歧视黑人问题的申诉。
    如果这个法案能够获得通过而且切实执行，它将大大影响美国南方各州的政治，因为八十多年以来，由于南方黑人选民的选举权遭受剥夺，南方民主党的种族主义分子一直得以控制着南方的政治。
    有消息说，共和党政府所以提出这个法案，是想在明年的国会选举中争取选票，夺回目前操在民主党手里的对国会的控制权。
