    An Old Crow Can't Dress Up as a Dove
    Dulles Goes to London to Interfere with Disarmament Talks
    (Our correspondent in London, 30th dispatch) The London disarmament talks, which began in March, were originally scheduled to end in late July. The Disarmament Subcommittee was already preparing to draft a report to the United Nations.
    At this moment, the United States suddenly took two dramatic actions. One was to request that the negotiations continue, supposedly because the United States' new proposals on disarmament have not yet been fully presented. The second was that Eisenhower suddenly sent Dulles to London to discuss disarmament and Middle East issues with Macmillan and Lloyd.
    Why such affectation? Over the past four months, the United States' delaying tactics at the negotiating table have been too blatant. The U.S. representative dragged on for nine weeks just to present one proposal, and still refuses to put forward all of them straightforwardly. And the so-called proposals that have been put forward link problems that are easy to solve one after another. For example, the cessation of hydrogen bomb testing must be linked to the reduction of conventional armaments, and the reduction of conventional armaments must be linked to the "resolution of political issues." In this way, the serious disarmament issue has become an endless wrangle and empty talk.
    The whole world is already impatient with this approach of the United States. Therefore, Dulles took the opportunity to flaunt himself in the disarmament negotiations in order to show the world a gesture: how much the United States values the disarmament issue! The Secretary of State has personally taken the field...! Unfortunately, Dulles' reputation is not very good, but very bad. Even the British Conservative Party newspapers said not to regard this "ill-omened bird" as a "messenger of good news" ("Daily Telegraph"). Because everyone remembers that as late as the 22nd, Dulles was still ranting, expressing his die-hard attitude on the disarmament issue. There is no way for Dulles to transform himself into a "peace messenger" overnight.
    It is revealed that a specific plan for Dulles' visit to London is to try to "persuade" Britain, France, and other North Atlantic group countries to reach a consensus on certain issues (such as the area and scope of aerial inspection) so that the United States and Western countries will be in an advantageous position when the negotiations end: shifting the responsibility for not reaching an agreement to the Soviet Union. Dulles and some of his colleagues will eventually find that their plan to make the Soviet Union carry the burden will not succeed.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in London on July 29th to participate in the disarmament talks that have been going on for more than four months.
    Although some newspapers are hyping Dulles' trip, no one really expects Dulles to propose any substantive new disarmament proposals. Dulles has already stated at London Airport that his greatest concern about disarmament is the establishment of "aerial inspection." He even threatened that if no agreement could be reached in another month, the disarmament issue would become more complicated.
    Due to Dulles' arrival, the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting originally scheduled for July 30 has been postponed to July 31.

### 老乌鸦装扮不了和平鸽  杜勒斯到伦敦干预裁军谈判

    老乌鸦装扮不了和平鸽
    杜勒斯到伦敦干预裁军谈判
    本报伦敦30日电　从3月开始的伦敦裁军谈判，原定在7月底告一段落。裁军小组委员会已在准备起草给联合国的报告了。
    正在这个时候，美国忽然采取了两个戏剧性的行动。一是要求谈判继续进行，据说美国对裁军问题的新建议，直到现在为止，还没有来得及全部端出来。二是艾森豪威尔突然派杜勒斯来到伦敦，同麦克米伦和劳埃德等商谈裁军问题和中东问题。
    为什么要如此做作呢？过去四个多月中，美国在谈判桌上的拖延手段做得太露骨了。美国代表仅仅为了提一个方案就拖了九个星期，至今还不肯痛痛快快地全部端出来。而拿出来了的所谓建议，又是把本来容易解决的问题，偏要一环又一环地扣起来。例如，停止试验氢弹必须同裁减常规军备联系起来，裁减常规军备又要同
  “解决政治问题”联系起来。这样，便把严肃的裁军问题，变成了无休止的扯皮和清谈。
    全世界对美国的这一套都已感到不耐烦了，因此，杜勒斯就借便到裁军谈判中去张扬一番，以便向全世界表示一个姿态：美国多么重视裁军问题啊！国务卿都亲自出马了……！可惜的是，杜勒斯的声名，不是香得很，而是臭得很。连英国保守党的报纸都说，不要把这只“不祥之鸟”看成“报喜讯的使者”（“每日电讯报”）。因为谁都记得，直到22日，杜勒斯还在大放厥词，表示他在裁军问题上的死硬态度。杜勒斯是没有办法在一夕之间把自己摇身一变为“和平使者”的。
    据透露，杜勒斯来伦敦的一个具体打算是设法“说服”英法和其他的北大西洋集团国家，在某些问题（例如空中视察的地区和范围）上取得一致意见，以便在谈判结束时使美国和西方国家处于有利的地位：把不能达成协议的责任推给苏联。杜勒斯和他的一些同道们，到头来总会发现：他们想使苏联背包袱的打算是不会成功的。
    据新华社伦敦30日电　美国国务卿杜勒斯7月29日到达伦敦，前来参预已经举行了四个多月的裁军谈判。
    尽管有些报纸对杜勒斯此行大吹大擂，但是没有人真正预计杜勒斯会提出任何实质上的裁军新建议。杜勒斯在伦敦机场上已经声明，他对裁军最关心的是建立“空中视察”问题。他甚至威胁说，如果再过一个月不能达成协议，裁军问题就会复杂化。
    由于杜勒斯的到达，原订在7月30日举行的裁军小组委员会会议已经决定延期到7月31日举行。
