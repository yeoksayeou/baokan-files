　　Introducing Souvanna Phouma

　　Prince Souvanna Phouma, who was newly appointed to form a cabinet in the Kingdom of Laos, was born in 1905 and is fifty-two years old this year. He was born into the Luang Prabang royal family, and is a nephew of the current King Sisavang Vong of the Kingdom of Laos. Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, is his half-brother.

　　Prince Phouma studied in France in his youth, attending the École Spéciale des Travaux Publics, du Bâtiment et de l'Industrie and the Institut d'électrotechnique de Grenoble. After completing his studies and returning to his country, he worked as an engineer in Vientiane from 1939 to 1945. In the Provisional Resistance Government established in October 1945, he served as Minister of Transportation and Engineering. After French colonialists returned to Laos in 1946, he was forced into exile in Thailand. In July 1949, after France and Laos signed the "Franco-Laotian Agreement" agreeing to Laotian independence, Prince Phouma returned to Laos.

　　In November 1951, Prince Phouma first served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom, concurrently holding the positions of Minister of Engineering, Posts and Telecommunications, and Planning. In October 1953, he went to Paris to sign the "Franco-Laotian Treaty of Friendship and Association" with the French government, which stipulated that France recognized Laos as completely independent within the French Union. In March 1954, the Laotian royal cabinet was reorganized, and Prince Phouma continued to serve as Prime Minister of the Kingdom. In October 1954, Prince Phouma resigned from the position of Prime Minister, and served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense in the succeeding Katay Don Sasorith cabinet.

　　In March 1956, Prince Phouma once again served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom, concurrently holding the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Information. In his policy program, he emphasized peaceful negotiations to resolve the Laotian issue and supported the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In August of the same year, he held talks with Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, in Vientiane, and reached a principled agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Laotian issue. In late August of last year, Prince Phouma led a delegation from the Royal Laotian Government on a ten-day friendly visit to our country and issued a joint statement with our government, reaffirming Laos's firm commitment to implementing a policy of peace and neutrality.

　　At the end of December 1956, Prince Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, issued a joint communiqué on the establishment of a coalition government before the by-elections for members of the National Assembly. On May 30 this year, Prince Phouma resigned from the position of Prime Minister. Katay Don Sasorith and Phoui Sananikone were successively mandated to form a cabinet, but neither obtained authorization from the National Assembly.
