Education and academic circles should open the doors to the national heritage and to world scholarship for young people, and help them develop their originality on the basis of studying Marxism well.

Zhou Gucheng's Speech

I have already spoken a lot in the Hunan group meeting. Now I still want to express some opinions on education and academic issues here for your reference. The budget for higher education in the 1957 budget is higher than in 1956, and the funding for scientific research has increased even more. This is because the motherland is progressing and can afford to develop education and academics, which is exciting. What is especially exciting is the unprecedented new era of academic development. There have been two major eras of academic development in history: one was ancient times. Ancient China, India, and Greece all had highly developed academics, but they were monopolized by the exploiting classes and declined in the Middle Ages. The other was modern times. Academics in modern capitalist countries also had a high degree of development, but they were also monopolized by the exploiting classes. In the era of imperialism, development was also restricted by class and could not fully serve mankind. Today, we are different. We have entered the socialist era, an unprecedented golden era of academic development. Our academics will not be monopolized by the exploiting classes, but will only serve all the Chinese people and can develop infinitely, which is particularly exciting.

In this unprecedented golden era, people in education and academic circles should open two doors for young people: one is the door to the national heritage. The motherland's cultural heritage, such as science, philosophy, literature, and art, is very rich. It's just a pity that it hasn't been modernized yet. For example, economic historical materials in official histories are not compiled together, there are no chapters or sections, no content summaries, and no modern punctuation. They are completely in their original state, making it difficult for young people to access them. At the same time, the level of young people is very low. They are completely unfamiliar with the motherland's cultural heritage, just like foreigners. We must quickly modernize the motherland's cultural heritage; at the same time, we must help young people improve their reading ability, comprehension ability, and analytical and critical ability, so as to promote and develop the motherland's cultural heritage. Secondly, we must open a door to world scholarship for young people. World scholarship is changing rapidly, especially the rapid development of scholarship in socialist countries. For example, the Soviet Union's scholarship has surpassed capitalist countries in many aspects. At present, college students are not very concerned about world scholarship. To catch up with the world's academic level in a short period of time, we must enable young people to understand the basics of world scholarship. Therefore, we must help them quickly improve their reading ability, comprehension ability, and analytical and critical ability, and learn the world's knowledge and experience. As Premier Zhou instructed: "Learn earnestly from the Soviet Union and from all socialist countries. Of course, we should also learn all knowledge and experience from other countries that are beneficial to the people, as long as it is possible."

We help students open two doors, not just to have them stand at the door, but to hope that they will develop their creative spirit on the basis of the national heritage and world scholarship and make contributions to the construction of the motherland. Decades ago, anarchists often said: If the Communist Party comes to power, human personality and originality will be eliminated. Now some people in the country are spreading this kind of nonsense. Rightist Zhang Bojun is like this. But they are completely wrong. What the Communist Party wants to eliminate is exploitation and poverty, not personality and originality; eliminating exploitation and poverty will truly help cultivate personality and develop originality. To help young people develop their originality, we must help them study Marxism well. In the past few years, people in education and academic circles have often criticized themselves, saying: We can only forcibly put some Marxism in the introduction and conclusion of each subject, but we cannot put it in the main text. I think the reason why it is not put in the main text may be that the theory is explained thoroughly and it is in line with Marxism. If we explicitly put some in the introduction and conclusion, so that young people are familiar with it and can use it skillfully, it will only be beneficial and not harmful. In recent years, some college students often criticize teachers, saying: This subject also puts in some Marxism, and that subject also puts in some Marxism, which is repetitious and annoying. They think they have learned too much, but in fact they have learned too little. European and American capitalist countries have been studying capitalism for hundreds of years under the premise of upholding private ownership, and they still feel it is not enough; there is also civic training in schools to uphold private ownership. We have been studying Marxism for less than eight years under the premise of negating thousands of years of private ownership. Is that enough? Absolutely not enough. We cannot cater to the wrong ideas of students. We must quickly improve ourselves and help them study Marxism well so that they can contribute to socialist construction.

The rightist Zhang Bojun mentioned above is the leader of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and once led the entire party to accept the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party takes Marxism as its guiding ideology and wants to build a socialist society; he doesn't not know this. Secondly, the constitution clearly stipulates that the People's Republic of China is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, and the people's democratic system wants to build a socialist society; he personally participated in the formulation of this constitution. However, today, he is blinded by self-interest and has launched an anti-Party and anti-socialist campaign, put forward the absurd proposition of a political design institute, and attempted to undermine the constitution and socialist construction; this is absolutely intolerable. I am a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and will never recognize Zhang Bojun's leadership. I believe that all members who are loyal to the leadership of the Communist Party and loyal to the constitution will also never recognize his leadership. We firmly follow the Communist Party and firmly strive to build a socialist society.

    发展学术的大好时代
    教育学术界同人应为青年打开通往祖国遗产之门和通往世界学术之门，帮助青年在学好马克思主义的基础上发挥独创精神。
    周谷城的发言
    我在湖南小组会上已经讲过许多话，现在仍想在这里就教育学术问题发表些意见，供大家参考。1957年预算表上高等教育经费比1956年有增加，科学研究的经费增加更多，这是由于祖国在进步，拿得出钱来发展教育学术，令人兴奋。尤其特别令人兴奋的是空前未有的发展学术的新时代。学术的发展，在历史上有过两个大时代：一为古代。古代中国、印度、希腊学术都有高度的发展，但为剥削阶级所垄断，到中世纪就衰落了。另一为近代。近代资本主义国家的学术又有一次高度发展，但也为剥削阶级所垄断，到帝国主义时代，发展也受了阶级的限制，不能充分为人类服务。我们今日则不然，我们进入了社会主义时代，进入了发展学术的空前未有的大好时代，我们的学术不会有剥削阶级来垄断，只会为全中国人民服务，可以无限发展，这特别令人兴奋。
    在这个空前未有的大好时代里，教育学术界的同人应为青年打开两张门：一为通往祖国遗产之门。祖国文化遗产如科学、哲学、文学、艺术等都很丰富。只可惜都还未经过现代化。例如正史里面的经济史料没有编在一块，没有篇章节目，没有内容提要，没有新式标点，完全停在原始状态中，不易为青年所接触。同时青年的水准很低，对祖国文化遗产，如同外国人一样，完全陌生。我们必须赶快对祖国文化遗产作一番现代化的工作；同时必须帮助青年提高阅读能力、理解能力以及分析批判能力，以便在祖国文化遗产上作发扬光大的工夫。其次我们要为青年打开一张通往世界学术之门。世界学术，日新月异，尤其社会主义国家学术发展之速，一日千里。例如苏联的学术有好多方面超过了资本主义国家。目前大学生，对世界学术不甚关心。我们要在短时期内赶上世界学术水平，必须使青年能摸摸世界学术水平的底。因此，须帮助他们赶快提高阅读能力、理解能力以及分析批判能力，学习世界的知识和经验。如周总理所指示：“认真向苏联学习，向一切社会主义国家学习。当然，其他国家一切对人民有益的知识和经验，只要有可能，我们也都要加以学习。”
    我们帮助学生打开两张门，并非只要他们站在门口，而是要希望他们在祖国遗产和世界学术的基础上，发挥创造精神，对祖国的建设作出贡献。几十年前，无政府党人常说：共产党若当了权，人类的个性和独创都会消灭。现在国内也有人发这种谰言。右派分子章伯钧就是这样。但他们完全错了，共产党所要消灭的是剥削和贫困，不是个性和独创；消灭剥削和贫困，才真正有助于个性的培养和独创精神的发挥。要青年发挥独创精神，便须帮助他们好好学习马克思主义。几年以来，教育学术界的同人常作自我批评曰：我们只能在每门学问的导论和结论里硬装些马克思主义，正文中就不会装了。我想正文中没有装，可能是学理讲透了，符合了马克思主义。若导论和结论里，明确地装进些，使青年熟而能生巧，也只有好处，没有坏处。这几年来，有些大学生常批评先生曰：这科也装些马克思主义，那科也装些马克思主义，重复讨厌。他们以为学的太多了，其实是太少了。欧美资本主义国家在拥护私有的前提下学习资本主义，已几百年，还嫌不够；学校里还有拥护私有制的公民训练。我们在否定几千年私有制的前提下学习马克思主义，还不到八年，难道就够了吗？绝对不会够的。我们不能迎合学生的错误思想，我们一定要赶快提高自己，帮助他们学好马克思主义，使能于社会主义的建设作出贡献。
    以上所说的右派分子章伯钧是农工民主党的领导人，曾领导着全党接受共产党的领导。共产党是以马克思主义为指导思想的，是要建设社会主义社会的；他不是不晓得。其次宪法明白规定中华人民共和国是以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政的国家，人民民主制度要建设社会主义社会；这宪法更是他亲自参加制定的。然而今天，他竟利令智昏，发动反党反社会主义，提出政治设计院的荒谬主张，企图破坏宪法，破坏社会主义建设；这是绝对不能容忍的。我是农工民主党的成员，决不承认章伯钧的领导。我相信所有忠于共产党领导，忠于宪法的一切成员，也决不承认他的领导。我们坚决同共产党走。坚决为建设社会主义社会而努力。
