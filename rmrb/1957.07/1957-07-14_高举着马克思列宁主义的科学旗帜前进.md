    Advance Holding High the Scientific Banner of Marxism-Leninism
    Wang Yanan

    Since the Party called on everyone to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy and to engage in free discussion in the field of scientific research, a lively and healthy atmosphere of free debate has emerged in our academic circles, especially in social science forums and on lecture platforms. This atmosphere is in line with the general trend of our great social transformation and great construction in the economic and cultural fields over the past year. However, every issue has its opposite side. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the country, and the working people of the country, support our great social transformation and great construction, there are always a small number of people who dislike it. Thus, there is always an even smaller group of intellectuals, politicians, and even so-called experts and scholars with ambitions and class resentments, who attempt to use the opportunity of the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, especially the opportunity of the Party's rectification campaign encouraging everyone to offer opinions, to slander and attack socialism, the Party, and Marxism-Leninism. However, since directly and frankly opposing socialism and the Party cannot be done without reservation, just as openly supporting capitalism cannot be done without reservation, they use the guise of academic freedom to, on the negative side, wantonly discredit Marxism-Leninism and belittle its scientific value, and on the positive side, emphasize the restoration and respect of the bourgeoisie's philosophy, sociology, and related doctrines.

    How do they discredit Marxism-Leninism? A brief review of the explicit or implicit opinions against Marxism-Leninism in academic forums over the past year reveals nothing more than the following three points:

    1. The "Only One" Theory. Based on their own narrow viewpoints, they believe that Marxism-Leninism is absolutely exclusive, and that our academic circles after liberation only allow Marxism-Leninism to have a voice. When they make this accusation, they are also accustomed to citing how the founders of Marxism absorbed the rational insights of classical bourgeois scholars and utopian socialists. In fact, doesn't this precisely disprove that Marxism-Leninism is not exclusive, but opens the door to all truths? According to Marxism-Leninism, whether a theory conforms to the facts is the criterion for its approval or opposition. If it is correct, even if it comes from a hostile bourgeois scholar, it should be critically absorbed; if it is wrong, even if it comes from a Marxist, it should be severely criticized.

    2. The "Just One of Many" Theory. Since Marxists may also have erroneous views that need to be corrected, and bourgeois scholars may have correct opinions worth adopting, isn't this evidence that bourgeois doctrines and Marxist-Leninist doctrines should be placed on the same scale for measurement? They repeatedly state: before the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, Marxism-Leninism was just "one of many" viewpoints, and without political support, its academically superior position could not be maintained. Is this really the case? They fundamentally do not understand what kind of doctrine Marxism-Leninism is. It is a dialectical materialist worldview, and the social science of historical change of all human society established under the guidance of that worldview. How can it be considered "just one of many" when compared with the various branch theories formed by bourgeois scholars based on idealist and metaphysical viewpoints? How can you not distinguish between completely wrong and correct starting points, and between individual arguments that are right and wrong?

    3. The "Outdated Dogma" Theory. Precisely because they fundamentally do not understand, or deliberately fail to understand, what kind of doctrine Marxism-Leninism is, and what kind of science it is, they constantly talk glibly about how the theories published by Marx and Engels nearly a hundred years ago, and the views put forward by Lenin decades ago, have become outdated due to changes in circumstances. Here, they seem to regard themselves as "dialectical materialists." But is the dialectical materialist worldview of Marxism-Leninism outdated? Are its social science principles relating to the historical changes of mankind outdated? And are the new theories constantly put forward based on its worldview and social revolution principles (including Chairman Mao's recently published "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") also considered "outdated dogmas"?

    There is no doubt that their anti-Marxist-Leninist arguments contain active intentions, that is, their wishful thinking, which they did not conceal and clearly expressed in their anti-socialist scientific program until the Great Blooming and Great Contending: to restore and respect bourgeois social science.

    The facts must be so. When they advocate the restoration of capitalism, they have their reasons for doing so. We support socialism, and we must advance holding high the scientific banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    高举着马克思列宁主义的科学旗帜前进
    王亚南
    自党号召大家在科学研究领域内贯彻百家争鸣方针、展开自由讨论以后，我们的学术界，特别是社会科学的论坛和讲坛上，已经出现了活跃而健康的自由论争气氛。这气氛，是符合于我们一年来的社会大改造和经济文化上的大建设的总趋势的。然而问题总有它的反面。我们社会的那种大改造大建设，尽管全国绝大多数人，尽管全国的劳动人民是拥护的，但毕竟总有那么一小部分人不喜欢，从而，总有代表这一小部分人的意见的更小一撮知识分子、政客乃至有野心有阶级宿怨的所谓专家学者之流，企图利用争鸣的机会，特别是利用党整风鼓励大家提意见的机会，来对社会主义、对党、对马克思列宁主义横加诬蔑与攻击。但因直接而直率地反社会主义反党毕竟不能毫无顾忌，正如同明目张胆地拥护资本主义毕竟不能毫无顾忌一样，于是，他们就在学术自由的幌子下，在消极方面，尽情诋毁马克思列宁主义，贬低它的科学价值，而在积极方面，则强调恢复和尊重资产阶级的那一套哲学社会学及其有关的学说。
    他们是怎样诋毁马克思列宁主义的呢？简单回顾一下一年来学术论坛上的或明或暗地反对马克思列宁主义的意见，不外以下三点：
    1．“只此一家”论。他们根据他们自己的狭隘观点出发，以为马克思列宁主义是绝对排他的，以为我们解放后的学术界只允许马克思列宁主义有发言权。当他们作这种非难的时候，又惯于引证马克思主义创建者如何吸收了古典资产阶级学者和空想社会主义者的合理见解。其实这么说，不正好反证马克思列宁主义不是排他的，而是为一切真理敞开大门的么？根据马克思列宁主义，理论是否符合于事实，就是它赞成或反对的准绳。是对的，那怕是出于对敌的资产阶级学者，也要批判吸收；是错误的，就是出于马克思主义者，也要受到严厉的抨击。
    2．“不过是一家之言”论。既然马克思主义者也可能有需要予以评正的错误见解，资产阶级学者也可能有值得采取的正确意见，这不是应当把资产阶级学说和马克思列宁主义学说，放在同一个天秤上来加以衡量的证据么？他们不惮再三表示：在百家争鸣之前，马克思列宁主义学说也不过“一家之言”，没有政治上的撑腰，它的学术上的优越地位是保持不了的。真是这样的么？他们根本不了解，马克思列宁主义学说，是怎样一种学说，它是一种辩证唯物主义的世界观，以及在那个世界观指导下建立起来的关系全人类社会历史变革的社会科学。那和资产阶级学者依据唯心主义形而上学的观点所形成的这样那样的枝节理论较量起来，只能算是“一家之言”么？出发点完全错了和对了，个别论点有对有不对，怎好不加辨别呢？
    3．“过了时的教条”论。唯其他们根本不懂得，或故意不去了解马克思列宁主义究是怎样一种学说，怎样一门科学，他们就动不动高谈阔论地说马克思恩格斯在将近一百年前发表的理论，列宁在几十年前提出的见解，事过境变，已经变得不合时宜了。在这里，他们像以“辩证唯物论者”自居了。但马列主义的辩证唯物主义世界观过时了么？它那关系人类历史变革的社会科学原理过时了么？而根据它的世界观和社会革命原理不断提出的新学说（包括毛主席最近发表的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的见解），也算是“过了时的教条”么？
    他们如此这般的反马克思列宁主义的论调，毫无疑问地包含有积极的意图，那就是他们直到大放大鸣时才毫不隐讳地并明确地表白在他们反社会主义的科学纲领中的如意打算：恢复并尊重资产阶级的社会科学。
    事实必须如此。当他们赞成资本主义复辟的时候，他们是有理由这样做的。我们拥护社会主义，我们就必须高举着马克思列宁主义的科学旗帜向前迈进。
