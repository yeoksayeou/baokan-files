I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and other responsible comrades, and I suggest that the congress approve them.

I am a representative elected from Zhejiang Province, and I have been working in Zhejiang since 1952. I served as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. I was also the Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League. Recently, in Zhejiang, I, in my capacity as the Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, initiated the convening of symposiums, calling for full and frank airing of views. Subsequently, I also expressed my opinions multiple times at symposiums held by the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee. Due to my years of consistent arrogance and complacency, and my relaxation of study, some of the relatively progressive thoughts I originally had were completely squeezed out by bourgeois ideology. I did not have correct political views, I lost my position, and I lost my way. During the period of airing views, some of my words and actions sided with the right wing. In Zhejiang, I called on everyone to raise more shortcomings of the Party, saying that "the more acute the opinions are, the faster the wall will be torn down." I used the opportunity of airing views to exaggerate some of the Party's shortcomings, using them to damage the prestige of the leading comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, saying that the leading comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee did not understand literature and art and had always despised literary and artistic work. At the same time, I published articles in the "Xinmin Bao" attacking the Party's leading comrades in Zhejiang. For a time, I acted as the leader of the airing of views in Zhejiang, believing that it should only be released and not restrained, and that the more shortcomings exposed, the better. I thought that the exposure in the Zhejiang Daily was not enough, and even wrote a letter to Xu Zhucheng, the president of the "Wenhui Bao," asking him to send reporters to Hangzhou to collect materials for airing views and to expose a large amount of information. At a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, I also openly expressed my disagreement with the People's Daily editorial "What is the Reason for This," believing that this editorial was hindering the airing of views; I openly said that I disagreed with Comrade Wang Kunlun's criticism of Zhang Bojun, and actually defended Zhang Bojun. My words and actions during this period were detrimental to socialist construction and detrimental to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party. It is impossible for me to list the facts here and conduct a detailed review. Fortunately, the comrades of the China Democratic League in Zhejiang are doing their best to expose my various wrong words and actions. I will return to conduct a factual self-criticism, and I believe that the people will give me the fairest judgment. I have committed many principled and political errors. I have failed the Party's cultivation, education, and trust in me over the years. I have failed the trust and honor the people have given me. I want to confess my guilt to the people here.

Why do I still dare to speak here today? Because I have completely recognized my mistakes, I hate myself, I am ashamed; but I am determined not to cut myself off from the people. I am determined to stand up and fight against my wrong thoughts, and more importantly, to draw a clear ideological line with the rightists, resolutely expose the various evil conspiracies of the rightists, fight against the rightists, and also save myself. After suffering this painful lesson, I will definitely follow the Communist Party, strengthen my study of Marxism-Leninism, gradually change my world outlook, be a sober-minded and firm person, cherish my limited future years, and contribute all my strength to participating in socialist construction. Now I am preliminarily digging into the ideological roots of my mistakes: I am an intellectual who came from the old society. During the period of the bourgeois democratic revolution, I demanded democracy and freedom. At that time, I resolutely opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries, worked as the Communist Party's periphery, and worked seamlessly with many Party members. My words and actions were indeed on the progressive side. However, in the period of socialist revolution, my thinking could not keep up with the times and lagged far behind. In this period, the meaning of democracy and freedom was fundamentally different from before: not only is democracy relative to centralism, and freedom is relative to discipline, but more importantly, democracy and freedom serve socialism. But I have not been able to deeply understand this point. I yearned for the leisurely and comfortable life of the literati in the past, and was unwilling to use socialist discipline to restrain myself. Therefore, I felt unaccustomed to the new social system and even had a resistant attitude. I also relied on a little bit of cultural and historical knowledge to boast about myself and belittle others. I said that I wanted to study Marxism-Leninism, and I also read some books on Marxism-Leninism, but in reality, because my thoughts, viewpoints, and positions had not changed, I always resisted Marxism-Leninism and could not learn it. Therefore, I looked at all problems from the perspective of personal interests; for the current new things, I often only saw the shortcomings. Even if I saw the advantages, I thought it should be so and was not worth praising, and once I saw the shortcomings, I exaggerated them excessively. How could a person with my kind of thoughts, viewpoints, and positions not fall into the mud pit of the rightists in the current era of great social change in China?

Fellow representatives, at the rectification symposium held by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League a few days ago, someone has already exposed that there is a "base" of Luo Longji in Zhejiang. I am the Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League. Although I do not know the inside story of this "base," I feel that there are many signs that the Zhejiang China Democratic League is a "base" of Luo Longji. When I return to Zhejiang, I must first put forward my wrong words and actions, dig out the roots of my thoughts, let everyone criticize me, and let the people give me the punishment I deserve. At the same time, I must resolutely devote myself to the struggle against the rightists. We must break through Luo Longji's Zhejiang "base" and remove this "base."

I express to everyone on this solemn platform: I have awakened and am willing to accept transformation. I want to use action to transform myself and atone for my sins!

### 我辜负了人民给我的信任和荣誉  宋云彬的发言

    我辜负了人民给我的信任和荣誉
    宋云彬的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理，李先念、薄一波两位副总理和其他几位负责同志的报告，并建议大会予以通过。
    我是浙江省选出来的代表，一九五二年起一直在浙江工作。我做了浙江省人民委员会的委员，政协浙江省委员会的副主席，浙江省文联的主席。我又是民盟浙江省委员会的副主任委员。最近在浙江，我是以省文联主席的身分，开头来召开座谈会，号召大放大鸣的。随后我又在省委统战部召开的座谈会上多次发表意见。由于我多年来一贯骄傲自满，放松了学习，我脑子里原来有的一些比较进步的思想全给资产阶级思想挤掉了，我没有正确的政治观点，我丧失了立场，迷失了方向，在鸣放期间我的一些言论和行动，都站到右派方面去了。我在浙江号召大家多提党的缺点，说什么“意见提得越尖锐，墙就拆得越快”。我利用鸣放机会，竟对党的一些缺点加以夸大，用来损害浙江省委领导同志的威信，说浙江省委领导同志不懂文艺，一贯轻视文艺工作，同时又在“新民报”发表攻击浙江省党领导同志的文章。我一时竟以领导浙江鸣放者自居，认为只能放，不能收，缺点愈暴露得多愈好，认为浙江日报上暴露得还不够，居然写信给“文汇报”社长徐铸成，叫他派记者到杭州来收集鸣放材料，大量揭露。我在浙江省委统战部召开的座谈会上还公开表示不同意人民日报“这是为什么”的社论，认为这篇社论是阻碍鸣放的；公开说不同意王昆仑同志对章伯钧的批评，实际是为章伯钧作了辩解。我在这一个时期的种种言行，都是不利于社会主义建设、不利于巩固共产党的领导的。我不可能在这里列举事实，详细检讨，好在浙江的民盟同志正在尽量揭发我的种种错误言行，我回去要作实事求是的自我检讨，我相信人民会给我以最公正的裁判的。我犯下了许多原则性的、政治性的错误，我辜负了几年来党对我的培养、教育和信任，我辜负了人民给我的信任和荣誉。我要在这里向人民认罪。
    我为什么今天还敢在这里发言呢？因为我已经彻底认识了自己的错误，我痛恨，我惭愧；但我决不愿自绝于人民，我有决心站起来跟自己的错误思想作斗争，而更主要的是要同右派分子划清思想界线，坚决地揭露右派分子的种种罪恶阴谋，跟右派分子作斗争，同时也救出我自己。我受了这一次惨痛的教训以后，我一定跟着共产党走，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，逐渐改变我的世界观，做一个头脑清醒、立场坚定的人，珍惜我有限的未来的岁月，为参加社会主义建设而贡献出我的一切力量。我现在初步地把我犯错误的思想根源挖一挖：我是一个从旧社会来的知识分子。在资产阶级民主革命时期，我要求民主和自由，那时候，我坚决反对国民党反动派，做共产党的外围，跟许多党员同志契合无间地一道工作，我的言论和行动确是站在进步一面的。可是到了社会主义革命时期，我的思想跟不上时代，远远地落后了。在这个时期，民主和自由的含义根本跟以前不同了：不仅民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言，更重要的是民主和自由是为社会主义服务的。但是我没有能够深切地了解到这一点。我向往于过去的悠闲自适的士大夫生活，不愿意用社会主义的纪律来约束自己，因此对于新的社会制度感到不习惯，甚至有抵触情绪。又凭借了一点点的文化和历史知识，夸耀自己，轻薄别人。口头说要学习马克思列宁主义，而且也看了一些马克思列宁主义的书，实际上却因为自己的思想、观点和立场没有改变过来，对马克思列宁主义总是抗拒的，学不进去的。因此，看一切问题都从个人利益出发；对于目前种种新事物，往往只看到缺点，即使看到了优点，也认为应该如此，不足歌颂，而一看到缺点，就过分加以夸大。像具有我那种思想、观点和立场的人，在目前中国社会大变革的时代，怎么会不掉进右派分子的泥坑里去呢？
    各位代表，前几天民盟中央召开的整风座谈会上已经有人揭发浙江有罗隆基的“据点”。我是民盟浙江省委员会的副主委，我虽然不知道这个“据点”的内幕情况，我却觉得浙江民盟作为罗隆基的一个“据点”是大有迹象可寻的。我回浙江去，首先要把自己的错误言行摆出来，把自己的思想根源挖出来，让大家批判，让人民给我应得的惩处。同时我要坚决地投入反右派的斗争。我们要攻破罗隆基的浙江“据点”，拔掉这个“据点”。
    我在这个庄严的讲坛上向大家表示：我已经幡然悔悟，愿意接受改造。我要用行动来改造自己，将功赎罪！
