Xinhua News Agency, July 24th Dispatch from Paris: The strike struggle of the French working class to prevent further deterioration of living conditions is continuing to expand.

　　The nationwide strike of bank clerks has entered its third week. The labor-management arbitration committee meeting held on the evening of the 22nd failed to reach an agreement. The capitalists only agreed to increase wages by 3%. The National Committee of Bank Clerks Strike announced that they would never resume work until the demand for a 12% wage increase is met. Bank clerks in major cities across the country have also held rallies and demonstrations to support their demands. Paris police arrested more than thirty demonstrators.

　　The nationwide strike of prison wardens demanding increased wages has also entered its second week. The authorities' attempts at "conciliation" have not been successful.

　　The rotating strike of customs officers demanding increased wages, which began on the 19th, is continuing.

　　Reports indicate that employees in the state-run gas and electricity industries have also put forward demands for wage increases. If their demands are not met, they will hold a general strike within days. Last week, gas and electricity workers had already organized partial strikes.

　　In addition, approximately five thousand workers in the Nord and Isère provinces are currently on strike, demanding increased wages. All tugboat crews in the port of Le Havre also launched a strike recently, demanding that the port authorities pay overtime and holiday wages.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd Dispatch from London: The nationwide strike of 100,000 workers at private bus companies in Britain is still ongoing. This strike is the largest strike by bus workers in thirty years.

　　The strikers are receiving support from other transportation workers. Transportation workers in Coventry held a conference and decided to support the strikers morally and financially. Automobile transportation workers in Southend, near London, supported the strikers with action, striking for one day to demand increased wages. Municipal bus transportation workers in cities in the Mersey River basin also temporarily stopped work. Mass meetings of miners in Lancashire and the West Riding Trades Council have all passed resolutions supporting the striking masses.
