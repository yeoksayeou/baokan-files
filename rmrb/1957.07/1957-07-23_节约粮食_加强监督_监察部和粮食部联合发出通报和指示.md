Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: The Ministry of Supervision and the Ministry of Food jointly issued a circular on July 20th regarding problems found in the inspection of grain supply in cities and towns in Henan and other provinces and regions, demanding that all localities pay attention to saving grain.

The circular pointed out that many provinces and regions have achieved great success in the grain supply work in cities and towns. However, some areas and units have not conscientiously implemented the above instructions, and there are still some undesirable phenomena such as falsely reporting and fraudulently claiming, repeatedly purchasing grain, and wasting grain, especially in some collective catering units and industrial and commercial grain-using units such as government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, and schools.

The circular listed the problems revealed by the inspection of the supervision and grain departments in Henan and other provinces and regions, and pointed out that such phenomena of falsely reporting and fraudulently claiming and wasting grain are not allowed. If they are not thoroughly inspected, exposed, and quickly corrected, they will not only add many difficulties to the current grain work, but also cause extremely adverse effects politically. Therefore, it is required that grain departments at all levels conduct an inspection of the current urban grain supply business system and, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, cooperate with relevant departments to conduct regular publicity and education on saving grain and national grain policies for urban residents, especially units such as government agencies, organizations, schools, and industrial and mining enterprises, so that every resident can consciously save grain and fight against phenomena of wasting grain and violating national grain policies.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: The Ministry of Supervision and the Ministry of Food jointly issued instructions to local grain and supervision departments on July 19th, requiring them to continue to strengthen supervision and inspection of grain work in the second half of this year in accordance with the principle of rectification and improvement of work, so as to continuously improve grain work.

The instructions stated that the present time is the most arduous period for grain storage work. Local grain and supervision departments must continue to strengthen the inspection of grain safety, urge business departments to take active measures, strengthen temperature and quality inspections, and timely deal with insect-infested grain and "dangerous grain," especially to do a good job in flood and rain prevention to ensure the safe passage of grain through the summer.

The instructions required that local grain and supervision departments must conduct thorough inspections before the summer and autumn grain enter the warehouse to see whether the grain warehouses have done a good job in cleaning and disinfection, warehouse repairs, grain arrangement, and all necessary organizational work for sending grain into the warehouse. After the new grain enters the warehouse, in addition to organizing forces for key inspections, it is also necessary to promote grain departments to carry out self-inspections and take timely measures to prevent grain from becoming infested with insects and mildew.

The instructions required checking the implementation of the policy of pricing according to quality in the unified purchase of grain; in the unified sales work, the grain supply policy and the implementation of the supply plan should continue to be inspected in a focused and in-depth manner.

    节约粮食　加强监督
    监察部和粮食部联合发出通报和指示
    据新华社21日讯　监察部和粮食部20日联合发出关于河南等省、区检查市镇粮食供应中存在的问题的通报，要求各地重视节约粮食。
  通报指出，许多省、区的市镇粮食供应工作取得了很大的成绩。但是，还有一些地区和单位未认真贯彻上述指示，依然存在一定程度的虚　报冒领、重复购粮、浪费粮食等不良现象，特别是有些机关、团体、工矿企业、学校等集体伙食单位和工商行业用粮单位较为严重。
    通报中列举了河南等省、区监察、粮食部门检查揭露出来的问题，并指出，这种虚报冒领，浪费粮食的现象是不能容许的，如不加以深入检查揭露，迅速纠正，不仅给当前粮食工作上增加很多困难，而且在政治上会造成极不良的影响。因此，要求各级粮食部门对当前市镇供应业务制度进行一次检查，并在当地党、政机关领导下，配合有关部门，对市镇居民，特别是机关、团体、学校、工矿企业等单位，进行经常的节约粮食和国家粮食政策的宣传教育，使每个居民都能自觉地节约粮食，与浪费粮食、违反国家粮食政策的现象作斗争。
    据新华社20日讯　监察部、粮食部19日联合向各地粮食、监察部门发出指示，要求根据整风和工作两不误的原则，在今年下半年继续加强对粮食工作的监督和检查，以便不断地改进粮食工作。
    指示说，目前是粮食保管工作最艰巨的时候。各地粮食、监察部门必须继续加强检查粮食安全情况，督促业务部门采取积极措施，加强检温、检质，及时处理虫害粮和“危险粮”，尤其是要做好防汛、防雨的准备工作，以保证粮食安全度夏。
    指示要求各地粮食、监察部门在夏粮、秋粮入库之前，都必须深入检查粮食仓库是否做好清仓消毒、仓房修缮、粮食摆布以及送粮入仓的各项必要的组织工作。新粮入库以后，除应组织力量进行重点检查以外，并推动粮食部门开展自查，及时采取措施，防止粮食生虫、霉变。
    指示要求检查粮食统购工作中依质论价政策的贯彻执行情况；在统销工作上，应继续有重点地深入检查粮食供应政策和供应计划执行的情况。
