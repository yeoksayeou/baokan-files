Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 8th—The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries from the 2nd to the 5th, focusing on reviewing and studying various issues related to striving for a bumper autumn harvest in agriculture.

According to reports from various regions, since the start of spring plowing this year, all parts of the province have used great effort to lead and help agricultural cooperatives overcome the various difficulties following last year's disasters, rectify the organization and systems of the cooperatives, and resolve many problems in the production and management of the cooperatives, ensuring the timely sowing of spring crops. Currently, spring seedlings are generally growing well, and summer planting after the wheat harvest has also been largely timely, creating favorable conditions for striving for a bumper autumn harvest. However, in some areas with poor wheat harvests, areas continuously affected by disasters, and areas with weak political and ideological work, the production morale of cadres and farmers has somewhat slackened, and confidence in striving for a bumper autumn harvest is insufficient. Some agricultural cooperatives have not yet seriously implemented the system of contracting work to groups and households, or there are still unreasonable phenomena, the organization of labor is not yet rational enough, financial accounts have not been cleared in a timely manner, and the work style of some cooperative cadres is not democratic enough. In terms of production, some agricultural cooperatives still face serious difficulties; the most important of these are: livestock are weak, fertilizer is insufficient, and cultivation is extensive, especially in areas that have suffered from disasters for years and where land cannot be plowed for several years. Currently, it is also the most intense season for fighting against water, drought, and insect pests. Therefore, the meeting believes that it is necessary to concentrate leadership strength, adopt effective measures, stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, strengthen confidence in a bumper harvest, overcome difficulties, conquer disasters, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

In response to the above situation, the meeting decided that in July, August, and September, measures should first be taken to help agricultural cooperatives improve production, carry out small-scale competitions in various production activities such as pest control, flood prevention, fertilizer accumulation and topdressing, and intensive cultivation, and conduct timely evaluations. Second, concentrate efforts to help agricultural cooperatives improve production management, especially the production management of teams and groups. It is necessary to earnestly check the implementation of contracting work to teams and groups by the cooperatives, specifically help teams and groups solve unreasonable problems in contracting work, overcome waste and idleness, and improve the quality of labor. The various prefectural committees should assign special personnel to study and summarize the typical experiences of teams and groups in adopting longer-term fixed contracts. According to the feedback from farmers in various regions, there have been too many changes in production in the past, and they do not feel confident in their work, and they request stability. This request is worth noting. It is very necessary to adjust and determine the scale of cooperatives and teams, the division of cultivated areas, the contracting of work to groups and households, the use and maintenance of livestock and farm tools, the financial system, the production plan, the planting plan, and the labor and distribution system, one by one, in a planned and phased manner, according to the different conditions of each cooperative, and not to change them for a relatively long period of time, in order to stabilize the production morale of farmers, clarify their goals, and make long-term plans. It is necessary to earnestly help agricultural cooperatives conduct research and planning, and determine the longer-term plans of the cooperatives. For example, what main measures should be taken for grain-deficient cooperatives to become self-sufficient cooperatives within a few years, and for self-sufficient cooperatives to become surplus-grain cooperatives within a few years, etc. Each township, county, and special district, all the way up to the province, should make long-term plans on the basis of the annual plan. It is necessary to immediately start helping agricultural cooperatives formulate mass-based small-scale water conservancy development plans, finalize them before the autumn harvest, and launch a large-scale mass-based small-scale water conservancy construction campaign after the autumn harvest until next spring. In addition, effective measures should also be studied and resolved for livestock feeding management and fertilizer issues.

The meeting also focused on studying several policy issues related to rewarding production. Further clarified regulations were made regarding the continued implementation of the "three fixed" policy for grain, labor-based distribution within cooperatives, rewards for surplus production units and individuals, rewards for planting various types of potatoes, protection and development of livestock, increasing production by utilizing idle wasteland, and private plots for cooperative members to raise pigs. When further implementing these policies, more flexibility should be given to various regions in accordance with the principles of benefiting increased production and benefiting the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, so as to maximize the role of these established policies in encouraging enthusiasm for production.

The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the party's political and ideological work in conjunction with production. In addition to strengthening the work of the party branches, various regions can carry out publicity campaigns in connection with local real people and real events, vigorously publicize policies, sweep away evil influences, dispel farmers' ideological concerns, and stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production.

In addition, the meeting discussed measures such as doing a good job in current grain work and production and disaster relief work.

    中共河北省地委书记会议号召全省农民
    克服困难　战胜灾害　力争秋季丰收
    新华社保定8日电　中共河北省委员会2日到5日召开地委书记会议，集中地检查和研究了有关争取秋季农业丰收的各项问题。
    从各地汇报的情况来看，自今年春耕开始到现在，全省各地都以极大的力量领导和帮助农业社克服了去年灾后的种种困难，整顿了社的组织和制度，解决了社的生产和经营管理上的许多问题，保证了春季作物的适时播种。现在一般春苗生长良好，麦收后夏种又大部比较适时，给争取秋季丰收造成了有利条件。但是，在某些麦季歉收地区、连续受灾地区和政治思想工作薄弱地区，干部和农民生产情绪有些松懈，对争取秋季丰收信心不足。有些农业社包工包产制还没有认真推行或还有不合理的现象，劳动组织还不够合理，财务账目还没有及时结清，有些社干部作风还不够民主。在生产上，有些农业社还存在着严重的困难；最主要的如：牲口瘦弱，肥料不足，耕作粗放，尤其是连年受灾地区的土地几年不能翻耕。当前又正处在向水、旱、虫灾害斗争的最紧张的季节。因此会议认为，必须集中领导力量，采取有效措施，激发农民的增产积极性，坚定丰收信心，克服困难，战胜灾害，争取秋季丰收。
    针对上述情况，会议确定在七、八、九三个月内，首先要采取措施帮助各农业社把生产搞好，在灭虫、防汛、积肥追肥、精耕细作等各项生产活动上，开展小型竞赛，及时评比。第二，集中力量帮助农业社改善生产管理，特别是队、组的生产管理。要切实检查社向队、组包工包产的实行情况，具体帮助队、组解决包工包产中的不合理问题，克服浪费和窝工现象，提高劳动质量。各地委要抽出专人研究和总结队、组包工包产采取较长期固定的典型经验。据各地农民反映，过去生产上变动太多，干活心里没底，要求稳定下来。这种要求是值得注意的。把社、队的规模、耕作区划、包工包产、牲畜农具的使用保养、财务制度、生产规划、种植计划以及劳动、分配制度等，经过调整，根据各社不同情况，积极地有步骤地一项项定下来，较长期间不再变动，对于稳定农民生产情绪，明确奔头，作长远打算，是很必要的。要切实帮助农业社进行研究规划，定出社的较长远规划。例如缺粮社几年内达到自给社，自给社几年内达到余粮社，采取什么主要措施等等。各乡、各县、各专区直到省，都要在年度计划基础上作出长远规划。要立即着手帮助各农业社制定群众性小型水利发展规划，秋收前定案，秋收后直到明年春季开展一个规模巨大的群众性小型水利建设运动。此外，牲畜喂养管理、肥料问题等，也都要研究出有效措施加以解决。
    会议还着重研究了有关奖励生产的几项政策问题。对于继续贯彻粮食“三定”政策、社内按劳分配、奖励超产单位和个人、奖励多种薯类、保护和发展牲畜、利用闲散荒地增产、社员养猪自留地等，都作了进一步明确的规定。在进一步贯彻执行这些政策时，要根据有利增产和有利农业社巩固的原则，更多地给各地以灵活机动的余地，以便高度地发挥这些既定政策的鼓励生产积极性的作用。
    会议强调提出，必须结合生产，加强党的政治思想工作。各地除加强党的支部工作以外，可以结合当地实人实事开展宣传运动，大力宣传政策，扫清邪气，解除农民思想上的顾虑，激发农民增产积极性。
    此外，会议对作好当前粮食工作、生产救灾工作等措施，进行了讨论。
