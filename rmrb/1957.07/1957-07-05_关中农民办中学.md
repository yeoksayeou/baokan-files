Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Telegram: In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, agricultural cooperatives in Chang'an, Hua County, and other places are preparing to establish more than fifty privately run junior middle school classes. The plans for establishing these junior middle school classes in various locations are as follows: Tuition fees will be borne by the students themselves; the problem of school buildings will be solved with the assistance of the agricultural cooperatives, such as utilizing temples, public halls, or constructing houses by members contributing labor and materials; the school's equipment will be temporarily borrowed from farmers' homes, such as tables, stools, and utensils, or manufactured by the farmers themselves through fundraising. In order to facilitate students' commuting, the schools will be located in areas where students are relatively concentrated. The sources of teachers will mainly be high school graduates who did not pass the university entrance examinations, or the local government will be asked to assist. Where conditions permit, efforts will be made to add courses in agricultural production technology.

    关中农民办中学
    据新华社西安电　陕西省关中地区长安、华县等地农业社正在筹办五十多处民办初中班。各地筹设这些初中班的方案是：学费由学生自己负担；校舍问题由各农业社协助解决，如利用庙宇、公堂或者由社员献工献料修建房屋等；学校的设备，暂借用农民家里的桌凳、用具，或由农民集资自造。为了便于学生走读方便，学校的校址将设在学生比较集中的地方。教师的来源，主要聘请没有考上高等学校的高中毕业生，或者请当地政府加以协助。在条件许可的情况下，争取加授农业生产技术课。
