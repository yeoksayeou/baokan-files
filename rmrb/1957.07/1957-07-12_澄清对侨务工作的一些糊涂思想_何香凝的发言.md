I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, and the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Ulanhu.

Chairman Mao Zedong's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government put forward the fundamental principles of governing the country, elucidated the great achievements our country has made in the socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past eight years, and explained the increasingly consolidated people's democratic dictatorship and the gradual improvement of people's lives in our country. They gave a powerful rebuttal to the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements in the recent period.

In my speech at the forum of democratic personages convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, I mentioned: I believe that every progressive person in the democratic parties should strive to be a leftist; those who yearn for capitalism should not be content to be rightists for a long time, but should constantly transform themselves, so that they can have a bright future. Now, in the anti-rightist struggle, the people of the whole country have once again shown their determination to fight for socialism to the end. However, up to now, rightists such as Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Huang Shaohong are still stubbornly resisting, or procrastinating and refusing to repent. Do these rightists really want to cut themselves off from the people?

In the past eight years, overseas Chinese affairs work has made great progress. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for the transition period, the overseas Chinese affairs departments assisted the Party and government leading organs in mobilizing overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the five major movements and the three major transformations, and to participate in socialist construction; uniting and educating overseas Chinese to support the democratic and socialist transformation movement, and to support and assist the socialist construction of the motherland. However, overseas Chinese affairs work is also a relatively complex task in the work of our government. In the course of eight years of work, there have been many shortcomings and errors, which we have constantly checked and overcome in our work practice; at the same time, we have also constantly corrected various incorrect understandings of overseas Chinese affairs work, and constantly overcome incorrect estimations of the achievements and shortcomings of overseas Chinese affairs work. Even now, we still hear some incorrect, confused, and even erroneous opinions, which must be clarified. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about my personal views and ask for your corrections.

Overseas Chinese love their motherland. Some people say that various reform movements should not be carried out in domestic overseas Chinese areas, believing that overseas Chinese are dissatisfied with the motherland because of these reform movements. These statements are not in accordance with the facts and do not conform to the wishes of overseas Chinese.

First, the vast majority of overseas Chinese love their motherland. It is the hope of overseas Chinese for generations that the motherland will become prosperous and strong. Our country's construction achievements have made the long-cherished wishes of overseas Chinese a reality. Socialist construction and socialist transformation are two aspects of our country's path to socialism. Some people say that because overseas Chinese have special characteristics, various reform movements should not be carried out in domestic overseas Chinese areas, so as not to affect the unity of overseas Chinese abroad. Some people even blame "overseas Chinese for being deeply dissatisfied with the motherland because of these movements and reforms." These statements are not in accordance with the facts, nor do they conform to the wishes of overseas Chinese.

In the successive social reform movements, the government mobilized overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese together with the people of the whole country, and formulated special measures to implement these policies in overseas Chinese areas according to the special circumstances of overseas Chinese, guiding overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the social reform movement together with the people of the whole country, liberating the productive forces in overseas Chinese areas, making the social order in overseas Chinese areas peaceful, and creating a new atmosphere of diligence and thrift, changing the face of overseas Chinese hometowns. We know that socialist transformation is a necessary measure for the motherland to become strong. A strong country enhances our country's international status, thereby improving the situation of overseas Chinese abroad; overseas Chinese love the construction of their hometowns, and the new atmosphere of prosperity and peace in overseas Chinese hometowns after the reform is what overseas Chinese want. This is the most basic aspect of the consistency between the interests of the country and the interests of overseas Chinese, which is also the reason why the patriotism and love for hometown of overseas Chinese have been increasing in the past eight years. Overseas Chinese have lived abroad for a long time. In the early days of liberation, they did not know enough about the situation in the new China. Coupled with the influence of enemy rumors and slanders, a few people had doubts and dissatisfaction with certain reform measures in the motherland. However, after they learned about the true situation in the motherland and knew that we were constantly improving our work, they loved the motherland even more, thus the patriotism and unity of overseas Chinese became more expanded and consolidated. The facts reflected by the overseas Chinese who returned to the country to visit relatives and returned to their places of residence in recent years are like this.

Those who have the above-mentioned wrong ideas are attempting to use the fact that a few overseas Chinese once had doubts about the motherland due to lack of understanding, to negate the necessity and achievements of the five major movements and the three major transformations; they are attempting to use the special circumstances of overseas Chinese to deviate from the basic direction of the general line. It is also a manifestation of insufficient estimation of the patriotic and progressive aspects of overseas Chinese relatives. We know that without the five major movements, there would be no three major transformations; without the three major transformations, there would be no socialism. And more than 10 million overseas Chinese abroad support socialism, and more than 10 million overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese in the country want to take the socialist road. This has been proved by the facts of the past eight years, so overseas Chinese relatives will never agree with this statement.

Most overseas Chinese relatives have increased their income after agricultural collectivization. Some people say that the lives of overseas Chinese relatives have declined, which is not in line with the actual situation in general.

Second, 1956 was a year of high tide in agricultural collectivization, and it was also a year of great victory for the vast number of overseas Chinese relatives who actively participated in the rural socialist transformation. The number of overseas Chinese relatives participating in agricultural production has increased year by year, and their lives have been reliably guaranteed. During the Kuomintang rule, the living conditions of some overseas Chinese households without remittances were destitute and unable to survive. Today, there are also some overseas Chinese households without remittances, but they can still maintain the necessary living standards in agricultural production cooperatives. In the overseas Chinese areas of Guangdong and Fujian, due to the small amount of land and large population, and the fact that cash crops and sideline occupations have not yet been largely restored, coupled with the weak labor force of overseas Chinese relatives, the number of households with reduced income is higher than that of farmers, but the number of households with increased income has also reached about 65% to 70%. In cooperatives that are not well run, the number of households with increased income may not reach 70%, while in cooperatives that are well run, the proportion of overseas Chinese relatives with increased income is higher. For example, in the Wusi Advanced Cooperative in Jinli Township, Chenghai County, there are 126 overseas Chinese households, of which 93 households have increased income, accounting for 73.8% of the total number of overseas Chinese relatives; 2 households have no increase or decrease, accounting for 1.6%; and 31 households have decreased income, accounting for 24.6% of the total number of overseas Chinese households. The decrease in income is only a small part of the overseas Chinese households. Most of them used to live by renting out land without labor or unable to work. For overseas Chinese households with little or weak labor force and without remittances, the government has adopted the method of giving appropriate land remuneration and properly arranging labor to solve their living difficulties. In general, most overseas Chinese relatives have increased their income and improved their lives after agricultural collectivization. Some people say that the lives of overseas Chinese relatives have declined after liberation, which is not in line with the actual situation in general.

Overseas Chinese relatives generally have more income due to their participation in production, plus they have regular or irregular remittance income, so their lives are generally more affluent and their demand for materials is higher. The government has taken certain care measures for this special situation. After the implementation of unified purchase and sales, overseas Chinese relatives can still buy many other commodities in the market besides the several commodities that are purchased according to quota. As for some overseas Chinese relatives who have extravagant habits in the past and cannot be satisfied with certain materials today, this is also a normal phenomenon. Because today the government advocates building the country diligently and thriftily, running the family diligently and thriftily, and the people of the whole country are living a simple life, the urban and rural areas are transforming old customs and habits, and the decadent lifestyle of capitalism is bound to be gradually eliminated. Overseas Chinese relatives should also gradually change their lives in this new era of changing customs and habits. Therefore, some people think that the lives of overseas Chinese relatives have declined because they see that some overseas Chinese relatives are not satisfied with the supply of certain materials, which is incorrect. It must be recognized that due to our country's large population and the backwardness of its productive forces, the supply of materials to overseas Chinese relatives can only be solved on the basis of the development of production and the improvement of the lives of the people of the whole country. Within a certain period of time, the government will appropriately take care of the special circumstances of overseas Chinese hometowns, such as taking care of the regional allocation of materials according to the living conditions of overseas Chinese hometowns, which is reasonable. However, it is more important to start from the 600 million people and solve the problem under the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangement. It is also wrong to overemphasize the special care of a few people and affect the overall measures of the whole country.

Some people think that the reason why more overseas Chinese relatives went out in a certain period or in a certain area is the result of the overseas Chinese affairs work failing to implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy. This is due to a lack of comprehensive consideration and specific analysis of the issue of overseas Chinese relatives entering and leaving the country.

Third, frequent entry and exit of overseas Chinese relatives is a historical habit of overseas Chinese and a matter of their vital interests. After the founding of New China, many overseas Chinese returned to the country to visit relatives, sightsee, study, and work because they loved the motherland and missed their hometowns; domestic overseas Chinese relatives also went abroad to reunite with their parents, brothers, and relatives, visit, inherit property, and manage stores. The government has adopted the policy of giving as much convenience as possible to the entry and exit of overseas Chinese relatives, and the relevant authorities have formulated and promulgated some management measures to give them convenience and care, which has strengthened the connection between overseas Chinese and their domestic families, and thus strengthened the connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland. Therefore, the policies and measures taken by the government in this regard are necessary and correct.

In the past few years, the situation of overseas Chinese relatives entering and leaving the country is fundamentally different from that of old China. From 1950 to 1955, the number of people returning to the country each year exceeded the number of people leaving the country. For example, in 1953, the number of people returning to the country was 251.68% of the number of people leaving the country, and in 1954 it was 223.53%. After 1955, the government relaxed the examination and approval of overseas Chinese relatives entering and leaving the country, so the number of people leaving the country increased compared with the number of people returning to the country.

Analyzing the reasons why returned overseas Chinese relatives go to Hong Kong, we can also see that this is legitimate and reasonable. Among the returned overseas Chinese relatives who went abroad over the years, the vast majority are overseas Chinese relatives. This is because their relatives cannot return to the country for various reasons, and they must go out to reunite with their relatives. The vast majority of them will return to the country after living abroad (or in Hong Kong) for a short period of time. According to the statistics of 36 counties in Guangdong Province from January to November 1956, the overseas Chinese relatives who went abroad accounted for about 80% of the total number of returned overseas Chinese relatives who went abroad; among these overseas Chinese relatives, those who went to visit relatives and reunite accounted for 77%, and the rest were mostly returned overseas Chinese who went back to visit relatives and then went out again. Among the overseas Chinese relatives who went abroad, a small number were still not used to the socialist life in the motherland and yearned for the capitalist lifestyle abroad, so they applied to go abroad. Of course, in this regard, our some grass-roots work has shortcomings, such as improper arrangements for labor and production, but more importantly, in September 1956, the British authorities in Hong Kong implemented the unreasonable measure of "balanced entry and exit," which made it very difficult for returned overseas Chinese relatives to go to Hong Kong. They were afraid that it would be more difficult to go out in the future, so more people applied to go to Hong Kong, and even people who did not need to go out also asked to go through the procedures for going abroad. For a period of time, a few areas in Guangdong Province experienced a relatively tense situation in applying to go to Hong Kong. After education, persuasion, and proper arrangements by the relevant parties, this situation has been greatly changed. However, before the unreasonable measure of "balanced entry and exit" implemented by the Hong Kong authorities is cancelled, it will be difficult to improve the situation of overseas Chinese relatives entering and leaving the country.

Some people think that the reason why more overseas Chinese relatives went out in a certain period or in a certain area is the result of the overseas Chinese affairs work failing to implement the overseas Chinese affairs policy. This is obviously wrong to deny the achievements of the entire lower-level overseas Chinese affairs work with a partial situation without comprehensive consideration and specific analysis of the issue of overseas Chinese relatives entering and leaving the country. Moreover, it is also good for overseas Chinese to go to Hong Kong to meet their relatives, which can help overseas relatives understand the situation of the motherland and their hometowns, and it is also good for uniting overseas Chinese. It is also wrong to regard overseas Chinese going to Hong Kong as a bad thing.

We cannot measure the quality of our education work by the number of overseas Chinese returning to the country to study.

Fourth, regarding the issue of overseas Chinese students studying. In addition to actively encouraging overseas Chinese to raise funds for schools in their places of residence to solve the education problems of their children locally, the country also attaches great importance to assisting overseas Chinese children in returning to the country to study. The government has successively established three secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Fujian Jimei, and stipulated some preferential measures for overseas Chinese students to enter school. In recent years, great achievements have been made in the education of overseas Chinese children, helping nearly 40,000 returned overseas Chinese students enter schools at all levels in the country, of which about 20% have entered universities, and nearly 2,000 returned overseas Chinese students have graduated from universities one after another and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland.

Some people say that the decrease in the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country to study is due to the motherland's failure to strive for overseas Chinese students to return to the country to study, which is also not in line with the facts. From liberation to 1955, the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country to study increased year by year. In 1955, it increased more than ten times compared with 1949. Although the number of people returning to the country in 1956 decreased slightly, it has increased again this year. At the same time, although our educational policy for overseas Chinese students is to welcome and actively assist them in entering school, it is more important to encourage overseas Chinese to run schools abroad so that overseas Chinese students can receive appropriate education in their places of residence. This will not only enable them to be taken care of and educated by their parents and relatives nearby, but also learn the culture and economy of the country of residence, get along well with the people of the country of residence, and live there for a long time. It can be seen from this that it is not comprehensive to measure the quality of our education work by the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country to study, not to mention that the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country to study is not actually decreasing!

Overseas Chinese investment in the country is increasing year by year; the statement that the government's insufficient care has affected the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to transfer funds back to the country is unfounded.

Fifth, the government's policy of assisting overseas Chinese to invest in the country is based on the needs of the national economic plan, taking into account the wishes of investors, with state-run investment companies as the main body, and can also take the form of cooperative management or joint state-private ownership, and allow sole proprietorship in individual cases, so that overseas Chinese can choose a way that suits their wishes. In recent years, overseas Chinese have played a certain role in participating in local industrial and agricultural construction. In 1956, the shares absorbed by the Guangdong and Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Companies accounted for one-tenth of the local industrial investment in the two provinces; by 1956, there were 44 factories and enterprises established by overseas Chinese investment in the two provinces.

However, some people say that the government does not take enough care of overseas Chinese investment in the country, which has affected the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to invest in the country. Therefore, they suggested in order to encourage the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese investment: (1) to require continued dividends in addition to the 8% interest guarantee; (2) to allow overseas Chinese investors to pay foreign exchange interest unconditionally; (3) to allow holders of foreign exchange investment stocks to mortgage or overdraw in overseas Bank of China; (4) when returning the capital, to calculate in RMB and settle in foreign exchange according to the exchange rate at that time. This is not the case. And the above four points are inappropriate and cannot be accommodated. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the number of overseas Chinese investing in the country has been increasing year by year. Looking at the situation of the Guangdong and Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Companies absorbing funds, taking 1952 as 100, it was 305 in 1955, and 487 in 1956 plus the funds absorbed by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Investment Company. This shows that overseas Chinese investment in the country is active and increasing year by year. The statement that the government's insufficient care has affected the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to transfer funds back to the country is unfounded.

Regarding the issue of continuing to distribute dividends, we cannot agree. Because the Overseas Chinese Investment Company is a state-run overseas Chinese trust enterprise, and it has a relationship of principal and interest guarantee with investors. Investors are not responsible for the profits and losses of the enterprise. If dividends are distributed, the state-owned investment company will inevitably become a state capitalist economy that is responsible for its own profits and losses. This is contrary to the requirements of my country's socialist economy.

Regarding the issue of requiring the payment of foreign exchange interest, we have already started to solve it. The "Preferential Measures for Overseas Chinese Investment" passed by the State Council not long ago and will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates that, with the approval of the foreign exchange management agency, investors can be paid foreign exchange not exceeding 50% of the annual interest, which is roughly equal to the profit of industrial stocks in general capitalist countries at present. It can meet the requirements of investors to pay interest in foreign exchange. It is obviously incorrect to demand unconditional payment of foreign exchange interest, as it is an excessive demand on the country.

Regarding the issue of mortgaging or overdrawing stocks invested in foreign exchange overseas. As everyone knows, the dividend of the investment company is 8%, while the mortgage overdraft of the Bank of China in Hong Kong and other areas is 6-8% per year. It can be seen that there is still a certain difference in interest. Therefore, it can be said that this requirement is essentially a selfish plan, because the state has stipulated that the funds invested in the Overseas Chinese Investment Company will still be owned by the investors after socialism is built. If the stocks are used as collateral or overdraft in relevant banks overseas, investors may obtain more profits than investment with a small amount of capital, which is built on the basis of the country's banks reserving more collateral and overdraft funds, which damages the interests of the socialist economy. At the same time, stocks are securities, and according to national laws and regulations, they are not allowed to be taken out of the country. From the perspective of overseas Chinese themselves, it is also unfavorable to carry securities to foreign countries due to environmental factors. Therefore, I think we should not harm the interests of the country and the majority of people only from the perspective of a few people.

Judging from the fact that my country's RMB currency value is stable and the inevitable law of currency devaluation in capitalist system countries, requiring calculation in RMB and settlement in foreign exchange at the exchange rate at the time of repayment is actually hedging the currency of capitalist countries. If we do that, the country must reserve foreign exchange exceeding the original investment amount to pay for this equity, which will inevitably affect the accumulation of the country's foreign exchange funds. The state absorbs overseas Chinese funds under the guidance of planned economy and uses them for various production and construction undertakings. The accumulation of production funds is not equal to the accumulation of foreign exchange. The method of repayment and settlement of foreign exchange calculated in RMB will not only affect the state's foreign exchange fund utilization plan, but also affect the expansion of socialist reproduction. Therefore, this wrong plan does not conform to the original intention of many overseas Chinese who are enthusiastic about the socialist construction of the country.

It can be seen from this that these requirements are: to obtain 8% interest in the country, and to obtain about 70% of the original capital amount in the overseas Bank of China; to ensure that the foreign currency amount can be maintained, and to ensure that the funds are not affected by the devaluation of capitalist currency. By doing so, the credit relationship between investors and the country is actually turned into a capitalist transaction relationship, which is incompatible with my country's socialist economic relations. From the perspective of overseas Chinese investors themselves, in addition to building the motherland and their hometowns, investing can guarantee principal and fixed interest, which guarantees their future retirement, and the education and living support of their children in the country. This is the requirement of the vast majority of overseas Chinese investors, and only a very few people have the above-mentioned wrong requirements. Therefore, the state cannot adopt this requirement.

From the above several issues, the achievements of overseas Chinese affairs work under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the cooperation of various relevant departments are affirmative, proving that the various overseas Chinese affairs policies are correct. Of course, there are still many shortcomings and errors in overseas Chinese affairs work, and there are also quite serious bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian styles in the overseas Chinese affairs departments, which must be resolutely overcome. However, every one of us Chinese must treat the achievements and shortcomings of all the work of the Party and the state with the spirit of being the master, distinguish the right and wrong of things with a positive and realistic attitude, and we have the responsibility to safeguard the interests of the country for those who deliberately attack the socialist system or those who make demands from the perspective of a few people and disregard the interests of the country.

    澄清对侨务工作的一些糊涂思想
    何香凝的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，和李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长、乌兰夫副总理所作的报告。
    毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话和周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，提出了治国的根本方针，阐明了我国八年来在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面所取得的伟大成就，说明了我国人民民主专政日益巩固和人民生活逐年得到改善的状况，对最近一个时期右派分子的反动言论，给予了有力的驳斥。
    我在中共中央统战部召开的民主人士座谈会上的发言中就提到：我认为民主党派中每一个愿意进步的人士，都要努力争取做一个左派；对于心里向往资本主义的人，不应该甘心长久做右派，要不断改造自己，这样他们才能有光明前途。现在全国人民在反右派斗争中，再一次地显示了为社会主义奋斗到底的决心。但是直到现在为止，章乃器、章伯钧、罗隆基、黄绍竑等右派分子，有些还在顽强抵抗，有些还在撒赖拖延，拒不悔悟。难道这些右派分子真要自绝于人民吗？
    八年来，侨务工作是有很大开展的。在国家过渡时期总路线光辉的照耀下，侨务部门协助党政领导机关发动侨眷归侨参加了全国的五大运动和三大改造，参加了社会主义建设；团结教育国外华侨拥护民主的、社会主义的改造运动，拥护和支援祖国社会主义建设。但是，侨务工作也是我国政府工作中一项较复杂的工作。在八年的工作过程中，有过不少缺点和错误，我们在工作实践中，不断地加以检查克服；同时我们也曾不断地纠正各种对侨务工作的不正确认识，不断地克服对侨务工作的成绩和缺点的不正确估计。现在也还听到一些不正确的糊涂的甚至是错误的意见，这是必须澄清的。我想趁此机会谈谈个人的看法，请大家指正。
    华侨是热爱祖国的。有人说，不应在国内侨区进行各项改革运动，认为国外侨胞因这些改革运动而对祖国不满。这些说法是不符合事实、不符合华侨的愿望的。
    第一，绝大多数华侨是热爱祖国的。祖国走向富强繁荣，是华侨世世代代的期望。我国的建设成就，使华侨梦寐以求的愿望成为现实。社会主义建设和社会主义改造是我国走向社会主义道路的两个方面。有人说，因为华侨有特殊性，不应在国内侨区进行各项改革运动，以免影响团结国外华侨。甚至还有人怪责“国外侨胞因这些运动和改革，而对祖国深怀不满”。这些说法都是不符合事实的，也不符合华侨的愿望的。
    在历次的社会改革运动中，政府对侨眷归侨和全国人民一齐发动，并根据华侨的特殊情况，制定了在侨区贯彻这些政策的特殊措施，引导侨眷归侨和全国人民一道参加社会改革运动，解放了侨区的生产力，使侨乡社会秩序安宁，出现了勤俭劳动的新风气，改变了侨乡的面貌。我们知道：社会主义改造是为求祖国强大的必要措施，国家强大就提高我国的国际地位，从而改进华侨在国外的处境；华侨热爱家乡建设，侨乡在改革后出现了繁荣安宁的新气象，就是华侨所愿望的。这是国家利益和华侨利益一致的最基本一面，也即是八年来华侨爱国爱乡热情日益高涨的道理。华侨长期远居国外，在解放初期，对新中国的情况不够了解，加之敌人造谣诬蔑的影响，有少数人对祖国的某些改革措施产生过怀疑和不满，但是当他们了解到祖国的真实情况和知道我们不断在改进工作之后，他们就倍加热爱祖国，从而华侨的爱国团结就更扩大、更加巩固了。数年来，回国观光省亲的华侨，在进入国门之前和返回侨居地之后所反映的事实，就是这样的。
    有上述错误想法的人，是企图利用少数华侨因对祖国尚不了解而曾经有过怀疑这一点，来否定五大运动和三大改造的必要和成绩；是企图利用华侨的特殊情况以脱离总路线的基本方向的谬论，也是对华侨侨眷的爱国进步方面估计不足的表现。我们知道，没有五大运动，便没有三大改造；没有三大改造，便没有社会主义。而国外一千多万华侨是拥护社会主义的，国内一千多万侨眷归侨是要走社会主义道路的。这是八年来的事实所证明了的，所以华侨侨眷也绝不会同意这种说法。
    大部分侨眷在农业合作化后增加了收入。有些人说侨眷生活下降了，从总的方面说是不符合实际情况的。
    第二，一九五六年是农业合作化高潮的一年，也是广大侨眷积极参加农村社会主义改造得到巨大胜利的一年。侨眷参加农业生产的逐年增加，生活得到可靠的保证。在国民党统治时期，有部分断汇侨户的生活处境是饥寒交迫、不能度日的。今天也有部分断汇侨户，但在农业生产合作社内还能保持必要的生活水平。在广东、福建的侨区，由于地少人多，以及经济作物、副业尚未大量恢复，加上侨眷劳动力弱，减少收入的户数虽比农民多，但增加收入户数也达到百分之六十五到百分之七十左右，办不好的合作社，增加收入的户数可能达不到百分之七十，办得好的合作社，侨眷增加收入的比例则高些。如澄海县锦里乡五四高级社一百二十六侨户，其中增加收入的九十三户，占侨眷总数的百分之七十三点八；不增不减的二户，占百分之一点六；减少的三十一户，占总侨户百分之二十四点六。减少收入的仅是侨户中的小部分。他们多是过去不劳动或不能劳动而靠出租土地生活的。对于劳动力少而弱又断汇的侨户，政府采取了给予适当的土地报酬和妥善安排劳动的办法，以解决他们的生活困难。总的说来，大部分侨眷在农业合作化后增加了收入，生活也有了改善。有些人说侨眷生活在解放后下降了，从总的方面来说，是不符合实际情况的。
    侨眷由于有参加生产的收入，加上又有经常的或不经常的侨汇收入，生活一般比较富裕，对物质的需求较高。政府对这种特殊情况已采取了一定的照顾措施。实行统购统销后，侨眷除了统销的几种商品按定量购买以外，其他许多种商品，侨眷仍然在市场上可以买到。至于某些侨眷因为过去有奢侈的习惯，今天在某些物资上不能得到满足，这也是一种正常的现象。因为今天政府提倡勤俭建国、勤俭治家，全国人民都过着朴素的生活，城乡正在改造旧习俗、旧风气，资本主义糜烂的生活方式逐步被淘汰是势所必趋的。侨眷也要在这种移风易俗的新时代逐渐改变自己的生活。所以，有些人因为看到一些侨眷对某些物资供应上的不满足，就认为侨眷生活下降了，这是不正确的。必须认识，由于我国人口众多，生产力还很落后，对侨眷的物资供应也只能在生产发展的基础上和全国人民生活提高的同时，加以解决。在一定时期内，政府对侨乡的特殊情况加以适当地照顾处理，如根据侨乡的生活情况，在地区性的物资调配上加以照顾，这是合理的。但是，更重要的是要从六亿人民出发，在统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针下加以解决，过分强调少数人的特殊照顾而影响全国性的整个措施，也是不对的。
    有的人因为某一时期、某一地区侨眷出去多了一些，便认为这是侨务工作没有贯彻侨务政策的结果。这是由于对侨眷出入国问题缺乏全面考虑和具体分析。
    第三，华侨侨眷经常出入国境，是华侨的一种历史习惯，也是他们的切身利益问题。新中国成立后，很多华侨由于热爱祖国，怀念家乡，相继回国探亲、观光、求学、就业；国内侨眷也因父兄亲人远居国外，出国团聚、探访、承继产业、料理店务的也不少。政府对华侨侨眷出入国境，采取了尽量给以便利的方针，有关机关曾制定和公布了一些管理办法，给以方便和照顾，密切了华侨与其国内家属的联系，因而也就加强了侨胞与祖国的联系。所以政府在这方面所采取的方针与措施是必要的，也是正确的。
    几年来，华侨侨眷出入国的情况，与旧中国根本不同。一九五○年至一九五五年历年回国的人数都超过出国的人数。例如，一九五三年回国人数为出国的百分之二百五十一点六八，一九五四年是百分之二百二十三点五三。一九五五年以后，政府对华侨侨眷出入国境审批方面有所放宽，因而出国人数较之回国人数有了增加。
    从归侨侨眷出国去香港的原因来分析，也可看出这是正当合理的。历年出国的归侨侨眷中，绝大部分是侨眷。这是因为他们的亲人由于种种原因不能回国，他们必须出去与亲人团聚。她们当中的绝大部分又都是在国外（或香港）短期居住就要回到国内来的。据一九五六年一月到十一月广东省三十六个县的统计，出国的侨眷，即约占出国的侨眷归侨总数的百分之八十；在这些侨眷中属于会亲、团聚的即占百分之七十七，其余的大部分多是回国观光、探亲然后再出去的归侨。在出国的侨眷中也有一小部分是由于对祖国的社会主义生活一时还不大习惯，贪恋国外资本主义生活方式，因而不安乡居而申请出国的。当然，在这方面，我们的有些基层工作是有缺点的，如安排劳动和安排生产不当等，但是更重要的情况，就是在一九五六年九月间，香港英国当局又实行“平衡出入”的无理措施，使归侨侨眷去港遭遇到很大的困难。他们害怕将来更不易出去，于是申请去港的多了，甚至没有必要出去的人也要求要办理出国的手续。曾经在一段时间里，广东省的少数地区，出现过申请去港的比较紧张的情况。经过了有关方面的教育说服和妥善安排，这种情况得到很大的改变。但是，在香港当局实行的“平衡出入”的无理措施未取消之前，要使侨眷出入国境的情况得到更好的改善，也有一定困难的。
    有的人因为某一时期、某一地区侨眷出去多了一些，便认为这是侨区工作没有贯彻侨务政策的结果。这是对侨眷出入国问题不加全面考虑，不加具体分析，而以局部情况来否定整个下层侨务工作的成绩，显然是错误的。而且侨眷出国去港会见亲人，可以帮助国外亲人了解祖国和家乡情况，对团结国外华侨也有好处，把侨眷出国赴港都视为是不好的事情，也是不对的。
    不能以华侨回国升学的人数的多少来衡量我们教育工作的好坏。
    第四，关于华侨学生就学问题。国家除了积极鼓励华侨在侨居地集资办学，就地解决子女教育问题外，对辅导华侨子女回国升学也是非常重视的。政府先后在北京、广州、福建集美三地创办了三所归国华侨学生中等补习学校，规定了一些优待华侨学生入学办法。几年来对华侨子女的教育取得了很大的成绩，帮助将近四万多归国华侨学生进入国内各级学校学习，其中已有约百分之二十进入了高等学校，还有将近二千名归国华侨学生先后从高等学校毕业，参加了祖国社会主义建设事业。
    有人说，华侨学生回国升学减少，是祖国对争取华侨学生回国升学不力，这也是不符合事实的。从解放到一九五五年华侨学生回国升学是逐年增多的，一九五五年比一九四九年增多十几倍，一九五六年回国人数虽略减，但今年又增多了。同时，我们对华侨学生的教育方针，虽是对回国升学的表示欢迎，积极辅导入学；但更重要的还是鼓励华侨在国外办学，使华侨学生在侨居地就能够受到适当的教育，这样就不仅能得到父母亲人就近照顾、教育，同时，也可以学习侨居国的文化、经济，与侨居国人民友好相处，长期生存。由此可见，以华侨学生回国升学的人数多少来衡量我们教育工作的好坏，是不全面的，何况实际上华侨学生回国升学的人数也不是在减少呢！
    华侨回国投资是逐年上升的；说政府照顾不够而影响了华侨调资回国的积极性的说法是没有根据的。
    第五，政府辅导华侨回国投资政策，是根据国家经济计划的需要，照顾到投资人的愿望，以国家经营的投资公司为主，也可以采取合作经营或公私合营的形式，并在个别情况下允许独资经营，以便华侨选择适合他们意愿的方式。几年来，华侨参加地方工农业建设起了一定的作用。一九五六年广东、福建华侨投资公司吸收的股金，各占两省地方工业投资的十分之一；至一九五六年，两省华侨投资创建的工厂和企业就有四十四个。
    但是，有人说，政府对华侨回国投资照顾得不够，影响了华侨回国投资的热情。因此，他们建议为了鼓励华侨投资的积极性：（1）要求在保息八厘之外，还继续分红；（2）允许华侨投资人无条件地支付外汇利息；（3）外汇投资的股票应准持有人在海外中国银行抵押或透支；（4）还本时，以人民币为计算单位，照当时外汇牌价，以外汇还本。事实不是这样的。而且上述四点都是不妥的，不可能予以迁就的。建国以来，华侨回国投资数字是逐年上升的。以广东、福建两省的华侨投资公司吸收资金的情况看，以一九五二年为一百，到一九五五年就为三百零五，一九五六年加上上海华侨投资公司吸收的资金为四百八十七。这就说明华侨回国投资是积极的、逐年上升的，那种说政府照顾不够而影响了华侨调资回国的积极性的说法，是没有根据的。
    关于继续分红的问题，我们不能同意。因为华侨投资公司是国家经营的侨资信托企业，它和投资人之间是保本保息的关系，投资人对企业不负盈亏责任。如果进行分红，势必将国营经济的投资公司变成自负盈亏的国家资本主义经济。这是和我国社会主义经济的要求背道而驰的。
    关于要求支付外汇利息问题，目前已着手解决。国务院不久前通过的并将提请人代常委会审议的“华侨投资优待办法”中规定，经过外汇主管机关批准后，可付给投资人以不超过年利息百分之五十的外汇，这与目前一般资本主义国家工业股票的利润大致相等，是可以满足投资人以外汇支付利息的要求。而要求无条件支付外汇利息，则是对国家过分的要求，显然是不正确的。
    关于以外汇投资股票在海外作抵押或透支问题。大家知道，投资公司的股息是八厘，而香港及国外其他地区中国银行的抵押透支，年利是六到八厘。可见利息当中也还有若干差额可得。因此可以说这种要求实质上是自私的打算，因国家对华侨投资已有投资于华侨投资公司的股金到社会主义建成后仍为投资人所有的规定，若再以股票在海外有关银行用作抵押或透支，投资人就可能以小额资本获得比投资更多的利润，这种利润是建筑在国家银行储备更多的抵押和透支的基金上的，这是损害社会主义经济利益的。同时，股票是有价证券，按国家法令规定是不得携出国境的，从华侨本身来说，有价证券携至国外，由于环境关系，也是不利的。所以，我认为不应该只从少数人着想而损害国家和大多数人的利益。
    根据我国人民币币值稳定的事实和资本主义体系国家货币贬值的必然规律来看，要求以人民币为计算单位，按还本时牌价结汇，实际上是替资本主义国家的货币保值。若是那样做，国家必须储备超过原投资数额的外汇来支付这项股本，这必定影响国家外汇基金的积累。国家吸收华侨资金是在计划经济指导下，用于各项生产建设事业的，生产资金的积累，并不等于外汇的积累，以人民币为计算单位的还本结汇的办法，不仅会影响国家外汇基金的使用计划，同时也会影响社会主义的扩大再生产。所以这种错误打算是不符合许多华侨热心国家社会主义建设的初衷的。
    由此可见，这些要求就是：既要在国内获得八厘利息，又要在国外中国银行取得保持原资本额百分之七十左右的活动能力；既要求能保住外币金额，又要求资金不受资本主义货币贬值的影响。这样做，实际是把投资人和国家的信用关系变成资本主义性质的交易关系，这是与我国社会主义经济关系所不相容的。再从华侨投资人本身来说，他们投资除为建设祖国和家乡外，因为投资能保本定息，对于他们将来的养老，对于现在国内子女的就学和生活赡养，都是有保证的。这是绝大多数华侨投资人的要求，有上述错误要求的仅是绝少数人。所以，国家不能采纳这种要求。
    从上面几个问题来看，侨务工作在中国共产党的领导下，在各有关部门的配合下，取得的成绩是肯定的，证明了各项侨务方针政策是正确的。当然，侨务工作中还存在不少缺点和错误，侨务部门也存在相当严重的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的作风，这些都必须坚决克服。但是，我们每一个中国人，都要以主人翁的精神，来对待党和国家一切工作的成绩和缺点，以积极的实事求是的态度来分辨事物的是非曲直，对于那些有意向社会主义制度进攻的言论和行为，或是从少数人出发而不顾国家利益的要求，我们有维护国家利益的责任。（附图片）
