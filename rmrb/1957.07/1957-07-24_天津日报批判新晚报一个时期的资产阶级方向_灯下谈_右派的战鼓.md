    Tianjin Daily Criticizes the New Evening News's Bourgeois Orientation During a Certain Period
    "Evening Chats"—Rightists' War Drums

    (Report from our newspaper) On July 22nd, the Tianjin Daily published articles by Ye Ying, Xiang Xian, and Xin Zhi, criticizing the bourgeois orientation of the Tianjin New Evening News during May and June, and the right-wing statements of Sun Zhaoyan, the director of the newspaper's editorial office.

    Ye Ying, in his article "War Drums Shielding the Rightists' Offensive," said: The "Evening Chats" in the New Evening News published many articles some time ago. The majority of them were stirring up trouble, lighting fires everywhere, fearing nothing more than a peaceful world. For example, "Evening Chats" on May 14th said: "Regarding airing views, it is still just beginning, and there is a sense of dullness. The low 'pressure' is indeed felt." (Qi Tian: "Break the Doldrums") "Evening Chats" on May 24th said: "Many non-Party people are still watching the climate, wanting to speak but holding back, ... worrying about retaliation; and more people urgently demand airing views, feeling choked but unable to express themselves." (Duan Di—Sun Zhaoyan: "Wishing the Airing Views Garden a Brilliant Radiance") By June 5th, "Evening Chats" again said: "Here, even in the summer when sandstorms obscure the vision, rain is still lacking. In the airing views garden, it is still not a season of favorable weather." (Duan Di: "Welcome Rain") During this period, it was the high tide of rightists taking advantage of the opportunity of the great blooming and contending to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the people. However, the New Evening News pretended to be "afraid of airing views," clamoring that the great blooming and contending were insufficient, saying that the Party's leading cadres "have been dodging and concealing, lacking the courage to open up the situation" (Sun Zhaoyan's words), accusing them of not allowing airing views at the grassroots level, saying that they "want to take it back." They attempted to use this statement to seal the people's mouths, so they could do whatever they wanted, and violating the steps of the rectification campaign, openly advocated airing views in middle schools and other grassroots units (see "Evening Chats" on May 14th and 17th). Using this tactic, they repeatedly "sought people" for the rightists, frequently urged on the war drums, shielded their attacks, and cheered them on!

    Xiang Xian, in his article "'Are There Still Many'?" pointed out: The rightist Sun Zhaoyan of the New Evening News once said: "'Evening Chats,' let me be responsible for the writing, I can write, but I can't write if I stand on the Party's position." If he can't write when standing on the Party's position, on what position can he write? When we read his two articles in "Evening Chats" under the pseudonym Duan Di, "Revisiting 'Seeking People'" (New Evening News, May 22nd) and "If Qu Yuan Lived Today" (New Evening News, June 2nd), we found the answer to this question, that is, when Sun Zhaoyan stands on the anti-Party, anti-socialist position, he can write articles. In these two articles, Sun Zhaoyan viciously distorted the current situation of China's intellectual circles and slandered the Party's policy toward intellectuals. He said that intellectuals' "just pursuits cannot be realized" and "full enthusiasm cannot be displayed," so today there are still "Qu Yuans" with "worried and sad hearts," still "Tao Yuanmings" who "retreat to the mountains and forests," and even some people who "hide their words in their hearts," "never saying them until they die," maintaining a "stubborn silence." He also "sought" some people who were "suppressed." Among them were those with "slightly haggard faces," those who "bitterly smiled," those who "fainted on the ground when the conversation reached a sad point"... He said that there were "still many" such people. In short, he depicted the face of China's intellectual circles today as a gray and gloomy one, and described the Party's policy toward intellectuals as "suppression." Here, he not only viciously attacked the Party, but also provoked the dissatisfaction of some backward intellectuals.

    天津日报批判新晚报一个时期的资产阶级方向
    “灯下谈”——右派的战鼓
    本报讯　7月22日的天津日报发表了夜莺、项贤和新之三人的文章，批判天津新晚报在5、6月间的资产阶级方向和该报总编辑室主任孙肇延的右派言论。
    夜莺在“掩护右派进攻的‘战鼓’”一文中说：新晚报“灯下谈”在前些日子发表了许多文章。其中大多数都是呼风唤雨，到处点火，惟恐天下不乱。例如5月14日的“灯下谈”说：“在鸣放上，还处于刚刚开始，而且有着一种沉闷。‘气压’之低，确是感到了的。”（启天：“打破沉闷”）5月24日的“灯下谈”说：“不少党外人士，还是在观望气候，欲吐又止，……耽心报复；而更多的人是迫切要求鸣放，如鲠在喉，却无从吐诉。”（短笛——孙肇延：“祝鸣放园地光辉耀目”）到了6月5日，“灯下谈”又说：“在我们这里，直到风沙迷目的夏天，雨水还是缺少。在鸣放园地里，也还不是风调雨顺。”（短笛：“喜雨”）在此期间，正是右派分子趁大鸣大放的机会，向党、向人民猖狂进攻的高潮。可是新晚报却装成“不敢鸣放”的样子，叫嚷大鸣大放不够，说什么党的领导干部“一直在躲闪掩盖，缺少勇气打开局面”（孙肇延语），指责不让在基层鸣放，说“要收了”。他们企图用这种说法封住人民的嘴，好任他们为所欲为，并且违反整风的步骤，公然主张中学等基层单位鸣放（见5月14日、17日“灯下谈”）。他们用这种手法，给右派分子一再“寻人”，频催战鼓，掩护他们进攻，给他们助威打气！
    项贤在“‘还有很多’吗？”一文中指出：新晚报的右派分子孙肇延曾说：“‘灯下谈’，让我文责自负，可以写，如站在党的立场上我写不了。”站在党的立场上写不了，站在什么立场上写得了呢？当我们读了他在“灯下谈”里以短笛为笔名所写的“再谈‘寻人’”（5月22日新晚报）、“假如屈原活在今天”（6月2日新晚报）两篇文章后，我们就找到了这一问题的答案，那就是当孙肇延站在反党、反社会主义的立场上的时候，他才能写出文章来。孙肇延在这两篇文章中，恶毒地歪曲了我国知识界的现状，诬蔑了党对知识分子的政策。他说现在知识分子的“正义追求无从实现”、“满腔热诚无从施展”，因而今天还有“忧怀愁伤”的“屈原”、还有“遁迹山林”的“陶渊明”，甚至还有人把“话藏在心里”，“直到老死也不说”，保持着“顽强的沉默”。他还“寻”到了一些被“压抑”的人。其中有“面容略见憔悴”的、有“苦笑”的、有“话到伤心处晕倒在地”的……。他说这样的人“还有很多哩”。总之，他把今日中国知识界的面貌描绘成一片灰暗、阴郁，把党对知识分子的政策说成是“压抑”。这里，他既恶毒地攻击了党，又挑拨了某些落后的知识分子的不满情绪。
