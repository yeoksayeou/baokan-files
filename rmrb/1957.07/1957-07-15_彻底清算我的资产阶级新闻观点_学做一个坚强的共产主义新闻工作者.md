Thoroughly Liquidate My Bourgeois Journalistic Views Learn to Be a Staunch Communist Journalist
Zhang Liqun, Editor-in-Chief of China Youth Daily

(I)

At the first news work symposium on May 16, I made a speech. This speech was full of bourgeois journalistic viewpoints. At the time of my speech, I was facing domestic rightists who were trying to usurp our party's leadership over the news media and maliciously attack the Party and the socialist system. By making such a speech, I objectively fired a shot at the Party, lost the proletarian stand, and committed a serious political error.

(II)

My speech at the first news work symposium was divided into five issues. Where did the errors lie?

The first issue was the question of to whom the newspaper should be responsible. As a proletarian newspaper, there is no doubt that it should be responsible to the socialist cause. Specifically, it should be responsible to the leading organs and the masses. Under our socialist system, the interests of the leading organs are consistent with the interests of the masses, so being responsible to the leading organs and being responsible to the masses are also consistent. However, in my speech, I actually set the two against each other. And under the one-sided reason of being responsible to the masses, I demanded that the newspaper have greater autonomy and independence.

In my speech, I said that when a meeting comes along, when you open the newspaper, what catches your eye is all documents, instructions, speeches, etc., published at great length, and the newspaper becomes a bulletin board. Should our newspapers publish meeting reports that are closely related to the interests of the broad masses and are of close concern to the broad masses? There is no doubt that they should be published, they must be published. If there is a problem here, it is only how to publish them better, and more loved by the masses. But in my speech, I treated this issue with a complaining, weary, and negating attitude, saying that the newspaper became a "bulletin board."

In my speech, I said that the newspaper editorial department often receives such and such accusations, saying that your doing this makes our work passive and causes trouble. If the newspaper causes trouble for practical work, even causing trouble, should it be blamed by everyone? There is no doubt that it should. One of the fundamental differences between our proletarian newspapers and all bourgeois newspapers is that every piece of publicity in our newspapers must be strictly responsible to the socialist cause, to our leading organs and the masses. We do not allow our newspapers to cause trouble and set fires irresponsibly. But in my speech, I wanted to shirk this responsibility, saying that the newspaper bears the responsibility of "stirring up trouble," which is obviously a bit wronged. The newspaper is just a propaganda organ. Can our people want this kind of irresponsible propaganda organ? Obviously, I was actually pursuing running an irresponsible bourgeois newspaper.

At the symposium, I said that our newspapers are too enthusiastic about imitation. For fear of making mistakes, the titles, wording, and writing of articles all try to imitate the tone of instructions and documents, the more similar the better. The newspaper seems to have become a gramophone and a reprint book. Can our newspapers publicize the intentions of the leading organs more vividly? Of course, it is possible, and it should be. When did our Party stipulate that every sentence of every article in our newspaper must be exactly the same as the instructions? However, in my speech, I obviously confused the content (thought) of newspaper publicity with the techniques of publicity. In terms of content, what is wrong with our newspapers becoming gramophones and reprint books of Marxist-Leninist thought and Party policies? Leaving aside Marxism-Leninism and Party policies, what else should we publicize? Without first affirming this principle, and one-sidedly pursuing vividness and innovation, it will inevitably fall into the quagmire of bourgeois newspapers.

I also said that the subordination of current news work and news workers is relatively large. This is also an extremely ambiguous statement. If this subordination refers to the subordination to the leading organs, what is wrong with that? The reason why our newspaper has a high prestige among the broad masses is precisely because it is a newspaper under the leadership of the Communist Party leading organs, which has a high mass prestige, rather than a liberal newspaper run by just a few intellectuals as "members." In order to run the newspaper well, every news worker should give full play to his creativity and spirit of independent responsibility. However, without affirming the prerequisite of guaranteeing the Party's leadership, and advocating creativity and independence, it will inevitably embark on the road of weakening the Party's leadership, and may even develop to the point of negating the Party's leadership.

Guaranteeing the Party's leadership over the newspaper is the unshakable and most important principle of our proletarian newspaper. But in my speech, I clearly showed wavering in this principle. Under the so-called "responsible to whom" statement, I was actually intentionally or unintentionally pursuing running a newspaper that does not need such strong Party leadership.

The second issue is about criticism. In this section of my speech, I mentioned the scope of criticism of the youth newspaper. On this issue, our newspaper did encounter some specific problems that needed to be solved, but I exaggerated this problem to the question of "can we criticize" i.e. the freedom of criticism, which is obviously a serious distortion and misunderstanding of the Party's news policy.

Our Party has always been the commander, supporter, and organizer of leading the people to fight against various shortcomings. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly made resolutions on criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. Criticism in newspapers is one of the ways for the Party to lead the people to fight against shortcomings and mistakes in order to improve work, but I one-sidedly exaggerated the role of criticism in newspapers. Under the one-sided ideological guidance of expanding the scope of criticism and increasing the amount of criticism, our newspapers also made some mistakes in criticism that did not ask about timing, effects, and inaccuracy. It neglected to guide young people on how to conduct criticism correctly, and overcome their biased, one-sided, and all-negating attitude towards shortcomings and mistakes. And I did not learn the lessons I should have learned from this, and mistakenly regarded the correct counter-criticism of the newspaper as a restriction on the newspaper's criticism.

The Communist Youth League's newspaper and the Party's newspaper are different in the scope and amount of criticism. As a newspaper led by the Communist Youth League, it should be in line with the position of the Communist Youth League in the entire national political life. But I believe that the organ newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is both a newspaper of a youth work department and a propaganda organ, emphasizing that it is completely the same as any newspaper in this propaganda organ. Therefore, the wider the scope of criticism, the better. This is exceeding the identity of the youth newspaper, as if some of our newspaper's criticisms can be detached from the constraints of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and independent of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

The third issue is about preempting. In this section of my speech, I said that news should pay attention to time, and should not be slow, so I proposed to advocate preempting. Should our news pay attention to timeliness? Of course, it should. The current phenomenon of undue delays in certain news reports should also be improved. But in my speech, I exaggerated the time factor of news, and even described it as the first principle of news. This is wrong. In a society and world where classes still exist, all news reports have class nature. What to report and when to report it cannot but be related to the interests of a certain class. Our proletarian news reports must take into account a major prerequisite, that is, all reports, whether criticism or praise, worry or joy, must be conducive to the socialist cause. This is the first principle of our news. On the premise of being conducive to the socialist cause, we should strive for speed in certain news reports. On the premise of being conducive to the socialist cause, we should also delay the publication time of certain news reports. Leaving aside the premise that we must follow the Party's policies and be conducive to the socialist cause to advocate preempting, this is obviously a bourgeois slogan. Under the guidance of this slogan, it will inevitably create chaos and create disadvantages to our cause. For example, we preemptively revealed the news that this year's apprentices would be delayed in becoming regular workers when the local government was still lacking preparation, which once caused chaos in Shanghai and other places. But I did not learn a lesson from it, improve my shortcomings, but still one-sidedly emphasized that I could preempt, which is obviously very inappropriate.

The fourth issue is about interviews. My speech emphasized the need to demand that various government departments and leading organs provide convenience in interviews, and also groundlessly exaggerated the difficulties in interviews for China Youth Daily reporters. Secondly, our news interviews have full freedom, and many of our agencies and organizations attach great importance to news reports. The problem is that reporters must also abide by certain disciplines during interviews, the interview targets of various newspapers must also pay attention to the division of labor, and the scope of interviews should also be different. However, I generally emphasized "treating everyone equally" and denied all boundaries, which is of course wrong.

The fifth issue is the issue of the artistic propaganda of newspapers, that is, the skills of layout and writing. There is no doubt that our proletarian newspapers also need to pay attention to layout skills. At present, our newspapers are still not doing a satisfactory job in this regard. Therefore, in the future, we need to continue to work hard to improve the layout and writing skills of the newspaper. But in my speech, I left aside the class viewpoint and political content, and talked about the art of layout and the form of propaganda in isolation. I talked a lot about the so-called mass psychology, saying that the masses like novelty, stimulation, difference, strangeness, speculation, etc. In fact, this is to run our proletarian newspaper into a newspaper that caters to the low-level interests of the petty bourgeoisie, and be the tail of their interests. In this part, I completely trafficked the stuff of bourgeois journalism.

From the above points, it can be seen that my bourgeois journalistic viewpoint has developed into a very serious one. The newspaper is an important tool for the Party and the state to guide the people to carry out the struggle. We need to work hard to improve the work of the newspaper. Following the development of the entire socialist cause, we should actively solve the various new problems that continue to arise in our work. After our country has entered the period of socialist construction, newspapers also have many important issues that we need to study and solve. We will never be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we will never stick to the rules. But all of this must solve a prerequisite, that is, from what stand, viewpoint, and principle to improve our newspapers, and to solve the various problems we encounter. My speech at the first news work symposium revealed that I did not clarify this prerequisite. Obviously, I was not exploring and solving the problems I encountered from the proletarian stand, from the proletarian journalistic viewpoint and principles. On the contrary, I was consciously or unconsciously expressing doubts and wavering about some major and basic principles of the proletarian journalistic viewpoint; and I was trying to find some good stuff from the warehouse of bourgeois newspapers without criticism and analysis. In this way, I was not aware that I had actually fallen into the quagmire of bourgeois journalistic viewpoints, until recently, with the help of leaders and comrades, I woke up.

(III)

The mistake I made this time also made me deeply feel that although I have received the Party's long-term education, the bourgeois thoughts that have entrenched themselves in the depths of my soul have not been completely cleared. Especially in recent years, I have developed a sense of pride and complacency. Under the control of this emotion, I overestimated too much and too highly the role that the China Youth Daily should play, and mistakenly believed that the reason why the China Youth Daily did not play its role enough was due to the restrictions of external factors; and I did not realize that the most fundamental reason why the China Youth Daily is not run as well as people would like is precisely because our political and theoretical level is low and our professional skills are poor. Also under the control of this proud and complacent mood, I became imprudent and lost my vigilance against bourgeois thoughts, so I made a serious mistake in the great storm of class struggle. For a cadre like me who has been nurtured by the Party for a long time, it is extremely inappropriate to make such a serious political mistake, and I should be subjected to the organization's due punishment. After this mistake occurred, the leading comrades of the Party and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the editorial board of the newspaper, and comrades from all aspects gave me strict but also full of expectations for criticism and help, which gave me a profound education, and also stimulated my determination and confidence to face the mistake and correct it in practical work. After the pain, I will definitely learn profound lessons from this mistake, thoroughly liquidate my bourgeois journalistic viewpoint, strengthen learning, transform my thoughts, and strive to be a staunch proletarian news fighter, and unite all the comrades of the newspaper to contribute to further running the China Youth Daily well.

专栏：

    彻底清算我的资产阶级新闻观点  学做一个坚强的共产主义新闻工作者
    中国青年报总编辑　张黎群
    （一）
    我在5月16日的第一次新闻工作座谈会上，曾有过一个发言。这个发言充满了资产阶级新闻观点。在我发言的时候，正面临着国内右派分子对我党新闻事业领导权进行篡夺，并对党和社会主义制度进行恶意进攻的时候。我作了这么一个发言，在客观上是向党放了一枪，失掉了无产阶级的立场，犯了严重的政治错误。
   （二）
  　我在第一次新闻工作座谈会上的发言，共分五个问题。它的错误在哪里呢？
    第一个是报纸应该对谁负责的问题。作为无产阶级的报纸，毫无疑问应该向社会主义事业负责。具体来说，也就是要向领导机关和群众负责。在我们社会主义制度下，领导机关的利益与群众的利益是一致的，因此向领导机关负责和向群众负责也是一致的。可是在我的发言中，在实际上却把两者对立起来了。并且在片面的向群众负责的理由下，要求报纸有更大的自主和独立。
    我在发言中说，一个什么会议一来，打开报纸一看，映入眼帘的全是文件、指示、发言等等，连篇累牍地发，报纸成了布告牌。我们的报纸应该不应该刊登与广大群众利益有密切关系，并且为广大群众所密切关心的会议情况呢？毫无疑问，应该刊登，必须刊登。如果说这里存在着问题，那只是如何刊登得更好，更为群众所爱看。可是在我的发言中，却以一种抱怨，厌烦和否定的情绪来对待这个问题，说报纸成“布告牌”。
    我在发言中说，报纸编辑部常常受到这样或那样的责难，说，你们这样一弄，使得我们的工作被动了，闯了乱子了。如果报纸给实际工作造成了麻烦，甚至闯了乱子，应该不应该受到大家的责难呢？毫无疑问，是应该的。我们无产阶级报纸与一切资产阶级报纸的根本区别之一，就在于我们报纸的每一个宣传都是要严格地向社会主义事业，向我们领导机关和群众负责的。我们不容许我们的报纸可以不负责地闯祸、放火。但是在我的发言中，却想推卸这种责任，说报纸担负着“惹是生非”的责任，这显然是有点冤枉。报纸只是一个舆论机关。难道我们的人民群众能要这种不负责任的舆论机关吗？显然，这是我实际上在追求去办一个不负责任的资产阶级报纸了。
    我在座谈会上说，我们报纸太热衷于模仿，为了生怕出错，标题、用语、写文章都尽量模仿指示、文件的语气，越像越好，报纸仿佛成了留声机和翻版书。我们的报纸可以不可以把领导机关的意图宣传得更生动一些呢？当然可以，也是应该的。我们的党什么时候规定过我们报纸每一篇文章的每一句话都要跟指示一模一样呢？但是，在我的发言中显然把报纸宣传的内容（思想）跟宣传的技巧混为一谈了。从内容上说，我们报纸成了马克思列宁主义思想、党的政策的留声机和翻版书有什么不好呢？难道离开了马克思列宁主义和党的政策，我们还应该宣传什么东西吗？不首先肯定这个原则，片面地去追求生动，标新立异，就必然会掉进资产阶级报纸的泥坑里去。
    我又说，目前新闻工作和新闻工作人员的从属性较大。这也是一句极为含混的话。如果说，这个从属性是指对领导机关的从属性，那有什么不对呢？我们的报纸所以在广大群众中有很高的威信，正是由于它是在具有很高群众威信的共产党领导机关领导下的报纸，而不是一张只是几个知识分子“同人”办的自由主义的报纸。为了办好报，每一个新闻工作人员，都应该充分发挥他的创造性和独立负责的精神。但是不肯定必须保证党的领导的前提，而去提倡什么创造性、独立性，在实际上就必然会走上削弱党的领导，甚至会发展到否定党的领导的道路。
    保证党对报纸的领导，是我们无产阶级报纸的不可动摇的最重要的原则。可是在我的发言中，却明显地表现了对这个原则的动摇。在所谓“向谁负责”的说法下，我实际上是有意无意地去追求办一张不需要党那么坚强领导的报纸。
    第二个问题是关于批评问题。在这一段发言中，我提到了作为青年报纸批评的范围问题，在这个问题上我们报纸确实碰到过一些具体问题需要解决，但是我却把这个问题夸大为“能不能批评”即批评自由的问题，这显然是对党的新闻政策的一个严重歪曲和误解。
    我们的党从来就是领导人民群众和各种缺点作斗争的指挥者、支持者和组织者，关于在报纸上的批评与自我批评，党中央曾经多次作出决议。报纸上的批评是党领导人民群众向缺点和错误作斗争以改进工作的方式之一，而我却片面地夸大了报纸上的批评的作用。在要扩大批评范围、增加批评分量的片面的思想指导下，我们报纸在批评方面也犯了一些不问时机、效果和不准确的错误。忽视了引导青年如何正确地进行批评，克服他们对待缺点、错误所采取的偏激、片面和否定一切的态度。而我没有从这当中吸取应有的教训，错误地把对报纸正确的反批评，看作是对报纸批评的限制。
    共青团的报纸和党的报纸在批评的范围上、分量上是有所不同的。作为共青团领导的报纸应该和共青团在整个国家政治生活中的位置相适应。而我却认为共青团中央的机关报既是一个青年工作部门的报纸，又是一个舆论机关，强调在舆论机关这一点上和任何报纸完全一样。因此，在批评的范围上越广越好，这是超越了青年报的身份，仿佛我们报纸的某些批评可以脱离团中央领导的约束，独立于团中央的领导之外似的。
    第三个问题是关于抢先问题。我在这一段讲话中说，新闻要注意时间，不要慢吞吞，因此提出要主张抢先。我们的新闻应该不应该注意时间性呢？当然应该。目前某些新闻报道上不应该的迟缓现象，也应该改进。但是在我的发言中却夸大了新闻的时间因素，甚至把它说成是新闻的第一原则。这就错误了。在尚存在阶级的社会和世界里，一切的新闻报道都是有阶级性的，报道什么，什么时间去报道都不能不关系到一定阶级的利益。我们无产阶级的新闻报道，就必须要考虑到一个大前提，就是一切报道，不论是批评或是歌颂，忧或是喜，都必须要有利于社会主义事业。这就是我们新闻的第一个原则。在有利于社会主义事业的前提下，我们对于某些新闻报道要力求迅速。在为了有利于社会主义事业的前提下，我们对于某些新闻报道也应该把发表的时间延迟一些。离开了必须按照党的政策、有利于社会主义事业的前提，来提倡抢先，这显然是一种资产阶级的口号。在这种口号的指导下，也就必然会制造混乱，对我们的事业制造不利。例如，我们曾在地方政府还缺乏准备的情况下，抢先透露了今年徒工要延迟转正的消息，就在上海等地一度造成混乱。可是我却没有从中记取教训，改进缺点，却仍旧片面地强调可以抢先，这显然很不应该的。
    第四个问题，关于采访问题。我的发言中强调了要求政府各部门和领导机关给予采访上的便利，并且还没有根据地夸大了青年报记者采访中的困难。其次，我们的新闻采访有充分的自由的，我们许多机关团体对新闻报道也都是十分重视的。问题是记者采访也必须遵守一定的纪律，各报采访的对象也要注意分工，采访范围也应该有所区别。我却笼统地强调要“一视同仁”，否认一切界限，这当然是错误的。
    第五个问题是报纸的宣传艺术问题，也就是编排和写作的技巧问题。毫无疑问，我们无产阶级的报纸也是要讲究编排技巧的。现在我们报纸在这方面还是做得不能令人满意的。因此今后还需要继续努力去改进报纸的编排和写作技巧。可是在我的发言中，却离开了阶级观点和政治内容，孤立地去讲编排艺术和宣传形式。大谈所谓群众心理，说群众喜欢新鲜、刺激、差别、奇异、猜揣等等。这实际上是想把我们无产阶级报纸办成一张迎合小市民低级兴趣的报纸，做他们趣味的尾巴。在这一部分里，我完全是贩运了资产阶级的新闻学的货色。
    从以上的各点中可以看出，我的资产阶级新闻观点，是已经发展成为十分严重的了。报纸是党和国家引导人民进行斗争的一个重要工具，我们需要努力改进报纸工作。跟着整个社会主义事业的发展，我们应该积极地去解决工作中不断出现的各种各样的新的问题。在我们的国家转入社会主义建设时期之后，报纸也有许多重要的问题需要我们去研究和解决。我们决不满足于已有的成绩，决不墨守成规。但是这一切，又必须解决一个前提，就是从什么立场、观点和原则去改进我们的报纸，去解决我们遇到的各种问题。我在第一次新闻工作座谈会上的发言，暴露了我并没有弄清这个前提。我显然不是从无产阶级的立场，从无产阶级的新闻观点和原则去探讨和解决所遇到的问题。相反的，我却是自觉或不自觉地对无产阶级的新闻观点的一些重大的、基本的原则，表示怀疑和动摇；又不加批判和分析地企图从资产阶级报纸的仓库里，找寻什么好的货色。这样，当我实际上已经掉进资产阶级新闻观点的泥坑里，还不自觉，直到最近在领导和同志们的帮助下，我才清醒过来。
    （三）
    这次所犯的错误，也使我痛切地感到，虽然我受过党的长期教育，但是盘据在我灵魂深处的资产阶级思想，却并没有得到彻底清除。特别是近年来，我滋长了骄傲自满的情绪。在这种情绪的支配下，过多和过高地估计了青年报应该发挥的作用，误认为青年报作用发挥得不够的原因，是由于外在因素的限制；而没有认识到青年报之所以办得还不能尽人之意，最根本的原因正是我们的政治理论水平低和业务本领差。也在这种骄傲自满情绪的支配下，我就不谨慎了，对资产阶级思想失去了警惕，于是在阶级斗争的大风浪中，犯了严重的错误。对于像我这样一个受党长期培养的干部来说，发生这样严重政治错误是极不应该的，是应该受到组织应有的处分。这一次错误发生后，党和团中央的领导同志，报社编委会和各方面的同志，给了我严格的而又充满期望的批评与帮助，使我受到了深刻的教育，也激发了我正视错误，在实际工作中改正错误的决心和信心。痛定思痛，我一定在这次错误中记取深刻的教训，彻底清算我的资产阶级新闻观点，加强学习，改造思想，努力做一个坚强的无产阶级新闻战士，并且团结报社全体同志，为进一步办好中国青年报而贡献出力量。（原载中国青年报）
