I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng.

Before the convocation of this Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, the Chinese Communist Party launched a rectification movement, combined with the upsurge of free airing of views, requesting people from all walks of life outside the Party, based on the principle of saying all they know and saying it without reservation, to offer more opinions and suggestions to help the Party's rectification. We, all 600 million people of the country, wholeheartedly support and are extremely excited about this spirit of continuous self-improvement and humility. Some right-wing elements, in broad daylight, actually launched attacks on the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country with programs, organizations, and plans, brazenly declaring that they wanted to break away from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This is really a strange thing beyond reason.

Firmly Fight to the End with All Right-Wing Elements

Now, these kinds of evil winds and fallacies have been severely refuted by righteous people from all walks of life, and they no longer have the opportunity to steal and are gradually dying down, but we must be more vigilant. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have built this solemn and splendid motherland with the blood and sweat of 600 million people. Our Constitution expresses the will of every one of our 600 million people. The Constitution stipulates that our state system is based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance. We unanimously request the Chinese Communist Party to lead us to gradually complete the socialist revolution and gradually complete socialist construction. With the reactionary thoughts of a small handful of right-wing elements, attempting to shake the foundation of our country and disrupt our peace, we cannot but express the greatest anger and contempt.

The Soviet Union is doing its utmost and faithfully and selflessly supporting our revolution and our construction. The whole world sees this. The Soviet Union helped us defeat Japanese imperialism, helped us overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang supported by American imperialism, and helped us build a great socialist cause. During the first five-year plan, it helped design and supply equipment for a total of 156 construction projects, provided us with a large amount of long-term preferential loans, and sent a large number of technical experts to help carry out various construction tasks. Isn't this worthy of gratitude? But some people would have the heart to obliterate everything, to doubt the Soviet Union, and even to utter the absurd and reactionary fallacy that the Soviet Union is not as good as the United States, to sow discord between the two great socialist brotherly countries of China and the Soviet Union, and attempt to weaken the strength of our socialist peace camp. What are their intentions?

Among our industrialists and businessmen, a few people unconsciously revealed their long-hidden resistance to reform and their selfish and self-interested essence during this free airing of views. Some people advocated extending the fixed interest rate to twenty years, some wanted to pay off the twenty-year dividends in one lump sum, some boasted that the bourgeoisie no longer had a dual character and were even more clever than the working class, and some even openly demanded that the public representatives withdraw from the joint state-private enterprises. Among these people, some pretended to be unbiased and said that it might be possible to try to withdraw the public representatives and let the private sector be solely responsible for a period of time, saying that if a scholar is employed by someone who appreciates him, the private sector will definitely go all out. It is really distressing to hear these absurd and outrageous fallacies even after eight years of national liberation. This is just as Premier Zhou said: it is all due to the profit-seeking and insatiable exploitation thinking of the bourgeoisie at work, all to cover up the attempt to restore capitalism. Advocating the withdrawal of public representatives from joint state-private enterprises is a blatant manifestation of rejecting socialist transformation.

The Chinese Communist Party, with its indomitable will, has led us out of the cruel oppression of feudalism and imperialism. Our 600 million people across the country and the Chinese Communist Party have long been fused into an inseparable whole. Our 600 million people across the country are determined to follow the bright road of socialism under the Chinese Communist Party. No instigation can shake our belief. We must wage a merciless struggle against these kinds of absurd and reactionary remarks, and against those who make such remarks and persist in their mistakes without repentance.

Be Good at Turning Labor into Wealth

The achievements of our motherland's construction and the improvement of people's lives in recent years are accurately illustrated by various statistics, which cannot be denied. Due to population growth, no matter how quickly industrial and agricultural production recovers and develops, it still cannot meet the needs and expectations of the vast majority of the people. This is an objective condition. Our country has a large population and abundant labor resources, but it is precisely because of the large population and rapid reproduction that we feel the lack of natural conditions. According to humanity's creation of wealth and seeking welfare for the masses, the materials taken are nothing more than three sources: one is what grows on the ground, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, etc.; the second is what is buried underground, such as minerals and oil; and the third is what is created by human labor, then all agricultural and mining production depends on human labor to control. Our motherland is vast and rich in resources. What grows on the ground and what is buried underground are very abundant, and human resources are especially abundant. We must make good use of these huge labor resources and turn them into wealth to serve the vast number of people at home and abroad. Regarding agriculture, I have made some suggestions to the government about reclaiming wasteland, building water conservancy projects, and manufacturing artificial fertilizers to make up for the lack of cultivated land area. The government is also focusing on considering and promoting these suggestions. According to Premier Zhou's report, a total of 36 million mu of wasteland was reclaimed in the first three years, and 29 million mu was reclaimed in 1956 alone; the irrigated area expanded by a total of more than 41 million mu in the first three years, and more than 100 million mu was expanded in 1956 alone. I was extremely excited to hear this.

Several Suggestions

Regarding industry and mining, the state focuses on developing heavy industry, which is a wise and essential measure. Hearing Premier Zhou's report on the outstanding achievements of our country's first five-year plan, we have a more correct understanding of the greatness of socialism. Regarding light industry and handicrafts, our country's development in recent years has been balanced and healthy. In order to more universally utilize labor resources and more universally and deeply explore the potential capabilities of the broad masses of people, I would like to make several suggestions to the conference today:

Strengthen the Task of Handicrafts

1. Strengthen the task of handicrafts to increase employment opportunities for the people. In Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Implementation Results of the 1956 National Economic Plan and the Draft of the 1957 National Economic Plan," it was mentioned that there are currently surpluses of employees in our country's factories and mines, and that industry can only develop gradually and cannot recruit a large number of employees every year. Therefore, in the future, labor employment should focus more on agriculture, agricultural and sideline industries, and handicrafts. This is a correct development that is in line with current objective conditions. As far as I know, agricultural cooperatives in various places are promoting the guidance and care of employed students as a key task, which shows that the government is implementing this good policy. This is in terms of agriculture and agricultural and sideline industries. As for handicrafts, because of the development of machine industry in recent years, the operating area of handicrafts is becoming narrower and narrower, and it is difficult to talk about utilizing labor resources and exploring potential strength. A considerable plan is still needed.

In the era of capitalist operation, handicrafts compete with machine industry and will be squeezed out and eliminated; however, we are living in the era of socialist construction today, and this calculation is not necessary. The state controls all human and material resources to seek welfare for the people, not what is profitable or loss-making. Labor employment cannot focus on industry, and agriculture and agricultural and sideline industries cannot place too much expectation on the area of cultivated land. In the transitional period when the machine industry has not been fully developed, the state should make appropriate arrangements to expand labor employment opportunities in handicrafts and increase production, which is indeed a measure that is appropriate for the times. I think this should be done in two steps:

First, try to restore and improve the existing handicrafts in the country, provide assistance and rewards to enable them to survive and engage in development. Our country's handicrafts have always been very developed, and the progress of skills often has unique features. Those that are mass-produced, such as ramie cloth from Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangdong, are sold well throughout the country and reach as far as North Korea and Japan; silk fabrics from Shandong and Henan are sold throughout Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and Singapore, and men use Shandong silk clothes instead of formal attire; there are also native cloth from northern Jiangsu and Shandong, and hand-woven towels from various places. In recent years, it seems that they have been affected by the machine weaving industry or restricted by raw materials, and many have been unable to operate and are seeking to change careers, resulting in daily decline. The silk from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Hubei is famous all over the world. During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese warlords intended to monopolize the silk market and systematically destroyed it. Mulberry trees in urban and rural areas were almost completely cut down, and they have gradually been replanted recently, but the vitality has been severely damaged and it is not easy to recover. There are also special crafts produced in various places that have always been sold abroad, earning huge amounts of foreign exchange for the country. In recent years, they also seem to be dying out due to the lack of large-scale promotion. All these different sideline occupations and handicrafts should be sorted out and supported by the state industry by industry, urging them to improve, so that they will not feel threatened by the mass production of the machine industry, and attention should be paid to their raw material supply to prevent the danger of production stagnation. If this part of handicrafts is sorted out properly, it can accommodate a lot of labor and create more wealth for the country.

Second, transfer some tasks from the machine industry to handicrafts to complete, so as to expand the working surface, so as to make the best use of people's talents and prevent the waste of labor. Many products of the machine industry can be completed by handicrafts. For example, the weaving of cloth and silk fabrics, domestic wood machines have always been used. If the state coordinates uniformly and solves the problem from the perspective of the people's livelihood, it seems that machine weaving factories can allocate part of the tasks to handicrafts to complete, so as to accommodate labor and free up the power of machine weaving factories to manufacture fine fabrics for sale in the international market, which is of great benefit to the country's economy, and handicraft workers are also taken care of and can support themselves. Hand-made cloth may be slightly rough, but it is quite strong and durable, which is in line with the spirit of diligence and thrift. In order to promote socialist construction, call on the people of the whole country to use it widely to support it, and it will certainly be easy to get a response. Also, the gauze for medical use is rough in quality and texture, and it seems that it can also be assigned to handicrafts for manufacturing, so as to adjust the production forces and make the best use of each. There should be many other similar situations.

Processed Commodities Should Pay More Attention to the International Market

2. The commodities processed by the machine industry should pay more attention to the international market to increase turnover. After a part of the textile industry's products are allocated to handicrafts for processing, a lot of power will be freed up to process fine fabrics. In order to promote international sales, attention should be paid to the habits and preferences of various places. The yarn count, width, color, and pattern of the fabrics need to be flexibly changed at any time in order to widely open up sales, easily obtain foreign exchange, and help socialist construction.

Promote Foreign Processing Tasks

3. Promote foreign processing tasks to make up for the lack of domestic raw materials. Industrial countries in the world, due to the small land area or suffering from insufficient raw materials, mostly absorb foreign agricultural and mineral products, make them into commodities, and then transport them to foreign countries for sale. In fact, it is an international processing behavior. For example, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Belgium in Europe have quite large annual production volumes of this type, which are constantly circulating, and the country and the people benefit greatly. Our country has a vast territory and abundant mineral resources, and there are still many wastelands that can be reclaimed, so there should be no shortage. However, our heavy industry construction is just beginning, and the people's lives cannot be improved quickly. In this period of transition, we should do our best to seek development. The production methods of the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and other countries mentioned above can be emulated by us. It is difficult to focus on other industries for a while, but in the textile industry, if we re-allocate tasks and handicrafts undertake part of it, and our cotton production cannot be increased proportionally for a while, the machine power will definitely be excessive. It seems that we can think about it internationally, and sign mutual assistance agreements to provide us with raw cotton, which we process into yarn or weave into cloth, and transport it back for sale. Since our country's liberation eight years ago, our international reputation has been high, and countries are expecting to expand trade with us, so it should be easy to cooperate. As for the direction of development, it seems that Pakistan, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Egypt can be the first targets. In addition to raw cotton, rice, rubber, and other commodities can be exchanged, which is also beneficial to us.

The above are for your criticism and correction.

### 更普遍地利用劳动资源  李国伟的发言

专栏：

    更普遍地利用劳动资源
    李国伟的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，和李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的报告。
    在这次第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议召集以前，中国共产党展开了整风运动，结合着鸣放的高潮，要求党外各界人士，本着知无不言言无不尽的道理，多提意见，多作建议，来帮助党内整风。这种自强不息虚怀若谷的精神，我们全国六万万人没有一个不是衷心拥护，而感到极度兴奋的。有些右派分子，居然在光天化日之下，有纲领、有组织、有计划的向中国共产党，向全国人民进攻，昌言无忌地说，要脱离中国共产党的领导，这实在是出乎情理之外的怪事。
    同一切右派分子坚决斗争到底
    现在这类歪风和谬论，遭到各界正义人士的严厉驳斥，已没有了窃发的机会而逐渐偃息，可是我们更要提高警惕。我们在中国共产党领导之下，以六万万人的血和汗来建造了这个庄严灿烂的祖国。我们的宪法，表达了我们六万万民众每一个人的意志，宪法规定，我们的国体是由工人阶级领导工农联盟为基础，我们一致要求中国共产党来领导我们，逐步完成社会主义革命，逐步完成社会主义建设。凭着一小撮右派分子的反动思想，妄图动摇我们的国本，扰乱我们的安宁，不容我们不表示最大的愤怒和鄙弃。
    苏联对于我们尽着极大的力量，忠实无私地来支援我们革命，支援我们建设，全世界众目共睹。苏联帮助我们战胜了日本帝国主义，帮助我们推翻了美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动统治，帮助我们建设伟大的社会主义事业，在第一个五年计划期间，帮助设计和供应设备的共有一百五十六个建设项目，给我们提供了大量长期的优惠贷款，并且派遣了大批的技术专家，来帮助进行各项建设工作，这还不值得感谢么？可是居然有人会忍心抹煞一切，来怀疑苏联，甚至发出苏联还不如美国的荒谬反动论调，来挑拨离间中苏两国伟大社会主义兄弟国家之间的情感，企图削弱我们社会主义和平阵营的实力，更不知是什么居心？
    我们工商界人士，有少数的人在这次鸣放之中，不自觉的露出了他们个人一向隐藏着的抗拒改造的内心，和自私自利的本质。有人主张把定息延长到二十年，有人想要把二十年的股息一次付清，有人夸说资产阶级没有两面性了，比工人阶级还要高明，甚至有人公然要求公方代表退出公私合营企业，其中包括着一些人，故作毫无成见的样子，说不妨试行撤出公方代表，由私方独立负责一个时期，士为知己者用，私方一定会出其死力的。这些荒谬不经的怪论，在全国解放八年之后，居然还能听到，实在使人痛心。这正如周总理所说：都是由于资产阶级的唯利是图贪得无厌的剥削思想的一面在作祟，都是为资本主义复辟的企图打掩护，主张公方代表退出公私合营企业，更是拒绝社会主义改造的一种露骨表现。
    中国共产党以百折不挠的坚强意志，领导我们，从封建主义和帝国主义的惨酷压迫之中，解放出来，我们全国六万万人民与中国共产党早已熔合成为一个不可分离的整体，我们全国六万万人民坚决要跟着中国共产党走社会主义的光明道路，任何挑拨离间，都不能动摇我们的信念。我们要与这一类荒谬反动的言论，和发出这种言论而坚持错误不肯悔改的人作无情的斗争。
    要善于把人力化作财富
    我们祖国这些年来建设的成绩，和人民生活的提高，有各种统计数字准确说明，是不容否定的；因为人口繁殖的关系，工农业生产尽管恢复和发展的如何快速，总还不能适应广大人民的需要和期望，这是客观的条件。我国人口众多，劳动资源是丰富的，但正是由于人口的众多，繁殖的迅速，而感觉到天赋条件的缺乏。按人类创造财富，为群众谋福利，其所取材，不外乎三个来源：一为地面所生长，如农、林、渔、牧等的生产；二为地下所蕴藏，如矿产石油等；三为人力所创造，则举凡一切农矿业生产，都依赖人力来掌握。我们祖国地大物博，地面生长和地下蕴藏都很丰裕，而人力尤为充沛，我们拥有这样巨大的劳动资源，必须善为利用，将它化作财富，为国内和国外广大人民服务。对于农业方面，我曾向政府提出关于开垦荒地，兴修水利，和制造人工肥料以补耕地面积不足的一些建议，政府也已在重点考虑，从事推进。按周总理报告，前三年共开垦荒地三千六百万亩，而一九五六年就开垦了二千九百万亩；前三年扩大的灌溉面积共四千一百多万亩，而一九五六年就扩大了一亿多亩，我听了感到无上的兴奋。
    几项建议
    关于工矿业方面，国家重点地向着重工业发展，这是贤明而扼要的措施，听到周总理报告，我国第一个五年计划的卓越成就，更使我们正确地认识到社会主义的伟大。关于轻工业和手工业，我国近年来的发展，是平衡而健康的。为了更普遍地利用劳动资源，更普遍而深入地发掘广大人民的潜在能力，我今向大会提出几项建议：
    加强手工业的任务
    一、加强手工业的任务，使人民增加就业机会。薄一波副总理“关于一九五六年度国民经济计划执行结果和一九五七年度国民经济计划草案的报告”中，提到目前我国厂矿企业的职工已有多余，而工业又只能逐步地发展，不可能每年都大量招收职工，因此今后劳动就业，要更多地在农业、农副业和手工业方面打主意，这是正确而切合于目前客观条件的发展。以我所知道，各地农业合作社对于就业学生的指导和照顾，作为重点任务而推进着，这说明政府正在贯彻执行这一个好的政策。这是在农业和农副业一方面。至于讲到手工业，则因近年机器工业发达，手工业的经营面日见窄狭，恐谈不到利用劳动富源和发掘潜在力量，尚须另作相当计划。
    在资本主义经营的时代，手工业与机器工业竞争，是要受排挤而归于淘汰的；可是，我们今天生活在社会主义建设时代，这算盘便用不着这样打。国家掌握着全部人力物力，为人民谋福利，不是什么盈亏赔赚的事，劳动就业既不能在工业方面打主意，农业和农副业则以耕地面积的关系，也不能寄托太多的期望。在机器工业尚未能充分发展的过渡时期，由国家适当安排，在手工业方面扩大劳动就业机会，增加生产，确不失为因时制宜的办法。我想这事应该分作两个步骤来做：
    第一，尽量恢复和改进国内旧有的手工业，予以扶助和奖励，俾得生存而从事发展。我国手工业，一向非常发达，技巧的进步，也往往有独到之处。其大量生产的，如江西、湖南、四川、广东的夏布，畅销全国，远届朝鲜、日本；山东、河南的茧绸，销路遍于南洋、印尼、新加坡一带，男子有以山东绸衣代替礼服的；还有苏北、山东的土布，及各地手工织造的毛巾，近年似乎都受着机织工业的影响，或者原料方面的限制，颇多无法经营，竞求转业，以致日就雕落。江、浙、川、鄂的蚕丝，驰誉全世界，对日抗战期间，日本军阀意图独占蚕丝市场，有计划的摧毁，城乡桑树被砍伐殆尽，近方逐渐补种，而元气伤斫过甚，未易恢复。还有各地出产的特种工艺品，一向外销，为国家换取巨额外汇，近亦似乎因无大规模的提倡而奄奄一息。凡此种种不同的副业和手工业，应该由国家逐行逐业予以整理和扶持，督促他们改进，使他们不要因机器工业的大量生产而感到威胁，并须注意他们的原料供应，勿使生产有停顿的危险。这一部分的手工业，如整理得法，可以容纳很多的劳动力，为国家创造更多的财富。
    第二，从机器工业拨出一部分任务，交手工业来完成，俾可扩大工作面，以期人尽其用，劳动力不致虚耗。有很多机制工业的制品，可由手工业来完成。有如布匹绸缎的织造，国内一向使用木机，若由国家统一调度，从人民生计出发，来解决问题，似乎可由机织厂划出一部分任务，交手工业来完成，俾可容纳劳动力，匀出机织厂的力量来制造精细的织品，为行销国际市场之用，于国家经济方面有很大的好处，而手工业者亦得到照顾，可以自食其力。手工制布，或者稍粗，然颇结实耐用，正合乎勤俭节约的精神，为了社会主义建设，号召全国人民广泛使用，以作支援，一定容易获得响应的。还有医药用的纱布，质理粗疏，似亦可划归手工业来制造，以求调节生产力量，各得其用。其他类似这种情形的当甚繁多。
    加工商品应多注重国际市场
    二、机制工业加工的商品，应多注重国际市场，以裕周转。纺织工业制品一部分拨归手工业加工之后，匀出许多力量来加工精细织品，为了推广国际销路，应重点注意各地的习惯爱好，织品用纱支数，幅度宽狭，颜色花纹，需要随时灵活转变，以求广泛打开销路，易取外汇，以裕资金的周转，为社会主义建设的帮助。
    推广国外加工任务
    三、推广国外加工任务，以补救国内原料的缺乏。世界工业国家由于国土隘小，或苦于原料不足，多有吸取外国农矿产品，制成商品，再运往国外行销者，实际是一个国际间的加工行为，如欧洲的捷克、瑞士、比利时，每年此类生产数量颇巨，循环不已，于国家人民获益甚大。我国幅员广大，矿产丰富，可开垦的荒地亦尚多，原可不虞匮乏，不过我们重工业建设方在开始，人民生活还不能很快的提高，在这青黄不接的时期，我们应该尽其可能，求取发展，则以上所举捷克、瑞士等国的生产方式，我们大可效法。别的工业一时当难着力，而在纺织工业一项，倘使我们重行分配任务，由手工业担任了一部分，而我们的棉花产量一时不能比例增高，机器力量一定会有过剩，似乎可在国际间想法，订立互助协约，供给我们原棉，由我加工纺成纱支或织就布匹，运回行销。我国解放八年以来，国际声誉隆高，各国对我正在期望扩大贸易，想必易于合拍。至于发展方向，似可先以巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸和埃及等国为对象，原棉之外，或以米谷橡胶等为交换品，于我亦是有利的。
    以上各节，请诸位代表批评指正。
