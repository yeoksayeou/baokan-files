Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 25th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on July 24th that President Nasser's remarks regarding the proposed Egyptian-Syrian union have resonated widely in the hearts of Syrian Arabs.

Bitar made these remarks while commenting on Nasser's speech to the Egyptian National Assembly on the 22nd. Nasser said that Egypt would respond to Syria's desire to form an alliance with Egypt.

Bitar said: "We should strive to promote the movement for unity between the two countries. This partial Arab unity, once completed, may lead to the unity of the entire Arab world."

After quoting Nasser's statement that the imperialist offensive in Syria is an attack on Arab nationalism itself, Bitar pointed out that Arab national unity is the only basis for any Arab country to preserve its independence.

Commenting on Nasser's speech, Damascus Radio said that the Syrian Parliament had a very positive reaction to Egyptian-Syrian unity. The radio pointed out that the unity of Syria and Egypt is a support for Arab nationalism and a heavy blow to imperialism.

    叙外长主张努力促进埃叙联盟
    两国团结是对帝国主义的沉重打击
    新华社大马士革25日电　叙利亚外交部长比塔尔7月24日说，纳赛尔总统提到拟议中的叙埃联盟的话在叙利亚的阿拉伯人心中引起了广泛的共鸣。
    比塔尔是在评论纳赛尔22日在埃及国民议会的演说时这样说的。纳赛尔说，埃及将响应叙利亚所主张的同埃及结成联盟的愿望。
    比塔尔说：“我们应该努力促进两国团结的运动。这种部分的阿拉伯团结在完成之后，可能会导致整个阿拉伯的团结。”
    比塔尔在引用了纳赛尔所说的帝国主义在叙利亚的进攻是对阿拉伯民族主义本身的进攻这番话以后指出，阿拉伯的民族团结是任何阿拉伯国家保全独立的唯一基础。
  大马士革电台在评论纳赛尔的演说时说，叙利亚议会对于埃叙团结有非常好的反应。电台指出，叙利亚和埃及的团结是对阿拉伯民族主义的支持，是对帝国主义的沉重打击。
