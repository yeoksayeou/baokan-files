Hawthorn, a very common fruit in northern China, is produced in large quantities and is easy to grow, so it is sold at a low price. The nutrients it contains, such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, carotene (which can be converted into vitamin A), thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), are more abundant than in grapes, oranges, apples, and pears (of which only the protein content is less than oranges, and thiamine is less than grapes and oranges).

    The state-owned Qingdao Meikou Winery has successfully trial-produced a new product—hawthorn sweet wine—using hawthorn. This wine has the special aroma of hawthorn and the mellow flavor of wine. According to calculations, the nutritional components (calculated by calorie content) contained in every tenth of a liter of hawthorn sweet wine are equivalent to four eggs or 1.3 *jin* of milk. Moderate consumption of this wine is very beneficial to health.

    红果酒
    红果（山楂），是我国北方的一种极为普通的水果，产量大，又易于种植，因此售价低廉。它所含的营养成分如蛋白质、脂肪、炭水化合物、钙、磷、铁、胡萝卜素（可转变为维生素甲）硫胺素、（维生素乙1）、核黄素（维生素乙2）、尼克酸、抗坏血酸（维生素丙）等，都比葡萄、橘子、苹果、梨为多（其中仅蛋白质含量比橘子少、硫胺素比葡萄、橘子少）。
    国营青岛美口酒厂用红果试制成功了一种新产品——红果甜酒。这种酒具有红果的特殊芳香和葡萄酒那样的醇厚风味。根据计算，每十分之一公升红果甜酒所含营养成分（以含热量计算）相当于四个鸡蛋或1.3市斤牛奶。适量饮用这种酒，很有助于身体健康。
