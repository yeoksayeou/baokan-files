    Flourishing Cats and Dogs in Britain
    Currently, British households own a total of eight million cats and dogs (2.5 million dogs and 5.5 million cats). This number has doubled in the past five years, with annual feed consumption reaching approximately £10 million. Cat food costs an average of two pence per week, while dog food increased from four shillings and seven pence in 1952 to five shillings in 1956. Feed manufacturers spent £500,000 on newspaper advertisements and £92,000 on television advertisements last year.
