Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 27th: The Indonesian Army and Youth Cooperation Organization was solemnly inaugurated at the State Palace in Jakarta on the evening of the 26th, and a swearing-in ceremony was held.

President Sukarno spoke at the inauguration ceremony, believing that the establishment of this organization demonstrated the national unity established among youths of different factions. He said that the contradiction of different ideological systems is currently a factor hindering Indonesian national unity. He mentioned again that China's method of "unity-criticism-unity" is worth emulating.

The Army and Youth Cooperation Organization is divided into an Executive Committee and a Review Committee. Lieutenant Colonel Pamurahardjo serves concurrently as the chairman of these two committees. The vice-chairmen of the Executive Committee are representatives from four youth organizations influenced by the four major parties. In addition, the Review Committee is composed of one representative from each of the 125 national youth and student organizations, and its task is to provide recommendations to the Executive Committee.

It was previously reported that the establishment of this organization was to facilitate youth assisting the military in implementing martial law to overcome current difficulties. The Army Chief of Staff has ordered the establishment of similar organizations in various regions.

    印度尼西亚民族团结的象征
    陆军和青年合作组织成立
    据新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚陆军和青年合作组织26日晚上在雅加达国家宫隆重宣告成立，并且举行了宣誓仪式。
    苏加诺总统在成立典礼上讲话，他认为这个组织的成立表明在不同派别的青年当中建立了民族团结。他说，目前不同的思想体系的矛盾是阻碍印度尼西亚民族团结的一个因素。他再次提到中国的“团结—批评—团结”的方式是可以效法的。
    陆军和青年合作组织下分执行委员会和评议委员会。由帕穆腊哈若中校兼任这两个委员会的主席。执行委员会副主席由受四大党影响的四个青年组织的代表担任。另外由全国一百二十五个青年学生组织各派代表一人组成评议委员会，它的任务是向执行委员会提出建议。
    以前曾经报道，成立这个组织是为了便于青年协助军方实施军事戒严令，以克服目前困难。陆军参谋长已命令各地成立同样的组织。
