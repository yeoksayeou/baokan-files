    Letter of Correction
    In the news item "Toad Cake Pills and White Arsenic Card Are Ineffective in Treating Swine Erysipelas and Pestilence" on page 3 of your newspaper on July 5, there is a sentence: "Dr. Sun Liangchen, who originally proposed the prescription, also participated in the experiment," which is inconsistent with the facts. Because Dr. Sun Liangchen participated in another matter from October last year to January 12th and 13th this year. He did not participate in the Veterinary Biological Products Supervision Institute's experiment from January to March this year. We hope you will make a correction.

    来函更正
    你报7月5日3版“蟾酥丸和白砒卡耳对治猪丹毒和瘟病无效”的消息中有一句话：“原来提出验方的孙良臣医师也参加了试验”，与事实不符。因为孙良臣医师于去年10月到今年1月12、13日参加试验的是另外一回事。他没有参加兽医生物药品监察所今年1月到3月的试验。希予更正。
