Confiscate the Traitor Dai Feng's "Dagger"
Sichuan Medical College Denounces Rightists

This newspaper reports that Dai Feng, a student probationary party member at Sichuan Medical College, betrayed the Party during the rectification campaign, becoming a "dagger" for attacking the Party.

In a poem, he shouted menacingly, "Dagger, sharpen quickly, dagger, don't hide, the blade will aim at the Party's chest!" and declared that he had "sharpened the dagger" and stepped forward. He also organized the "Torch News" to publish a large number of anti-Party reports, deliberately inciting teachers and students' dissatisfaction with the Party. He described the Party's call for the rectification movement as a spontaneous movement of the masses, scolding the Party committee for "only making rigid decisions, regardless of the voices below," and also scolding the Party's leadership as "tasting delicacies and fine wine alone, sleeping in high beds day and night," being a thoroughly corrupt "bureaucratic king." And he called on all members of the Communist Youth League in the college to reorganize the "Speaking Out Office". He also, on behalf of a group of people, protested "with angry feelings" against the Party newspaper's failure to publish news about students' speaking out.

The teachers and students of the medical college have recently begun to conduct a forceful rebuttal and resolute struggle against this rightist within the Party.

    缴下叛徒戴凤的“短刃”
    四川医学院怒斥右派分子
    本报讯　四川医学院学生预备党员戴凤，在整风中叛党，成为向党进攻的“短刃”。
    他在一首诗中杀气腾腾的狂叫“短刃啊，快擦亮，短刃啊，别收藏，刀锋就要瞄准党的胸膛！”并宣布自己已“擦亮短刃”挺身跃进，他并组织了“火炬报”大量刊出反党的报道，有意煽动师生对党的不满。他把党号召的整风运动说成是群众自发的运动，骂党委“只知作出僵死般的决定，不管下面的呼声”，又骂党的领导是“珍肴美酒独自尝，日日夜夜卧高床”，是腐朽透顶的“官僚王”。并呼吁全院共青团员重新组织“鸣放办公室”。他还代表一群人“以愤怒的心情”抗议党报不登大学生鸣放消息。
    医学院师生最近已开始对这个党内右派分子进行有力的驳斥和坚决的斗争。
