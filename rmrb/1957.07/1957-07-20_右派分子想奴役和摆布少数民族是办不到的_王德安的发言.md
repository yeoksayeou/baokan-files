Rightists Want to Enslave and Manipulate Ethnic Minorities, But They Will Not Succeed
Wang De'an's Speech

I fully support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and all the reports of the conference. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the production issues in the Qian Dongnan area.

The Great Development of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture

Under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our Qian Dongnan area established the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in July of last year. In the years since liberation, Qian Dongnan has completed land reform, launched the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and production has greatly developed. Last year, the entire prefecture achieved agricultural collectivization. Now, 95.8% of the farmers in the prefecture have joined cooperatives, of which 87.3% have joined advanced cooperatives. Due to the implementation of agricultural collectivization, despite severe drought in some areas last year, agricultural production still achieved a bumper harvest. Grain production increased by more than 7%. Now, grain production has increased by 48.6% compared to 1950. According to the results of the autumn harvest distribution last year, about 86% of the cooperative members in the prefecture increased their income. According to a survey in Wende Township, Zhenyuan County, the average income per person in the township reached 73.29 yuan in 1956, and various consumption levels increased significantly: cooking oil averaged 8 jin per person in 1955 and 9 jin in 1956; pork averaged 13 jin per person in 1955 and 19 jin in 1956; salt averaged 9 jin per person in 1955 and 11 jin in 1956. Longli Township, Jinping County, is a remote mountain area. Before liberation, more than 80% of households in the Xinzhong Advanced Cooperative in the township lacked grain, with a shortage of 150,000 jin in 1953. The situation fundamentally changed after the implementation of agricultural collectivization. In 1955, they sold more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain. Farmers' incomes have greatly increased, with the average income per person increasing from about 24 yuan in 1949 to 50.94 yuan in 1956, more than doubling. The first year of collectivization fully demonstrated its unparalleled superiority, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been further improved. With the development of production, the cultural education of the autonomous prefecture has also greatly developed. In 1956, the number of minority students in primary and secondary schools throughout the prefecture reached more than 130,000, accounting for 63% of the total number of students in the prefecture. The situation where minority children could not afford to go to school or were unable to study has greatly changed. For example, in Jiuyang Township, Jianhe County, only one person out of 2,043 households in the entire township was literate before liberation, and they only went to primary school with the help of others. The situation has changed greatly now, with 1,410 primary and secondary school students in the entire township. In the past, most counties in the Qian Dongnan area did not have hospitals. Now, not only does every county have a health center, but every district has a health station, and the people's health conditions have been greatly improved. Facts have proven that those rightists with ulterior motives who clamor that "people's lives have not improved" and "collectivization has messed things up" are completely reversing black and white with their anti-Party and anti-socialist absurd remarks. Lies cannot cover up the facts, and the rightists' conspiracy has completely failed in the face of the facts. Our Qian Dongnan Autonomous Prefecture has implemented the Party and state's ethnic policies, implemented ethnic regional autonomy, the ethnic minorities have become masters of their own affairs, production has greatly developed, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been greatly improved. Of course, there are still shortcomings in our work. During the upsurge of the collectivization movement, because we were busy organizing cooperatives and focused our attention on grain production, we once relaxed the arrangement of sideline production, which had a certain impact on the development of rural sideline production. After discovering this, corrections have been made. Currently, some areas are not doing well in the breeding, management, and reproduction of draft cattle, resulting in thin and dead cattle. In the implementation of ethnic policies, some areas have one-sidedly emphasized respecting the "eating cattle entrails" customs of ethnic minorities, without paying attention to educating the ethnic minority masses to slaughter fewer draft cattle when "eating cattle entrails," resulting in the slaughter of more draft cattle, which has affected production. These shortcomings must be seriously overcome. We must conscientiously examine the bureaucracy in our work during the rectification movement, promptly correct shortcomings and errors, and do our work better.

Plan to Develop Forestry Production in Qian Dongnan Area

Next, I would like to talk about the forestry production of the autonomous prefecture.

The Qian Dongnan area is rich in timber, with a forest area of about 480,000 hectares, a forest stock volume of more than 27 million cubic meters, and a harvestable volume of more than 14 million cubic meters, of which Chinese fir accounts for more than half. The characteristics of Chinese fir are: tall trunk, large accumulation of material, straight wood grain, rapid growth, light and soft wood, and resistance to corrosion. It is an important material for construction, shipbuilding, and electric poles. The masses in the forest areas, especially the ethnic minority masses, have a long history of experience in operating forestry production, such as small seedling afforestation, intercropping trees with grain, and so on. The artificial Chinese fir forests they have created can reach a diameter at breast height of 24.7 cm in 15 years, and can be cut down and used in 18 years. They can grow into large timber in 20 to 30 years, known as "Eighteen Fir." Its growth rate is understood to be twice as fast as larch in North China and four times as fast as red pine in Northeast China. In recent years, the prefecture has provided more than 1.1 million cubic meters of construction timber to the state, supporting national construction and increasing farmers' incomes. From 1953 to the first half of 1956 alone, the timber payments directly invested in farmers' hands reached more than 15 million yuan. Adding the income from forest by-products and timber processing and transportation, the actual income of farmers is even greater. According to a survey in the fourth district of Tianzhu County, in 1955, the income of farmers in the district from forestry production exceeded the total income from agriculture and sideline production, accounting for 50.74% of the total annual income. Forestry production occupies a very important position in the economic life of the people of Qian Dongnan. In the years since liberation, we have done a lot of work in afforestation, forest protection, and rational development and utilization of forest resources, creating more than 1.5 million mu of timber forests and economic forests. We have carried out mass forest fire prevention work, and forest fires have been greatly reduced. However, due to the lack of technical guidance, the survival rate of afforestation is very low. Last year, the average survival rate of afforestation in the prefecture was only about 60%. The phenomenon of indiscriminate logging and waste of timber continues to occur, and the Chinese fir trees near the Qingshui River, Duyang River, and Duliu River have been almost completely cut down. The work of the forestry department and the forest industry department is disconnected, and they do not cooperate well. The regeneration of forest land has not been done well, and the logging task has been increasing year by year. Therefore, more is cut down than is planted. If this situation is not changed in time, and if the logging task of 350,000 cubic meters this year (excluding timber for mass use) continues, in another ten years or so, the existing forest resources in the Qian Dongnan area will be cut down, which will cause great losses to the timber resources urgently needed for national construction. In the future, we must comprehensively carry out production planning, help cooperatives combine forestry with agriculture, coordinate production, mobilize the masses to plant and protect forests, save timber, and rationally utilize forest resources. The forestry department and the forest industry department must cooperate closely, carry out reasonable logging, and do a good job in the artificial and natural regeneration of forest land to ensure the continuous growth of forest resources. In addition, we hope that the Ministry of Forestry will appropriately expand state-owned afforestation based on the superior conditions of high-quality Chinese fir planting in the Qian Dongnan area, combine the advanced technology of state-owned afforestation with the mass experience of local artificial Chinese fir afforestation, carry out afforestation work, and send more technical personnel to the Qian Dongnan area to strengthen technical guidance. We hope that the Ministry of Forest Industry will build forest roads in the forest area, regulate the rivers in the forest area, implement the policy of deep mining and long-distance procurement, and rationally utilize forest resources. We also suggest that relevant industrial departments of the Central Government establish a machine-made paper mill in the Qian Dongnan area to fully utilize the waste materials and non-timber forests from logging and processing to increase paper production. As long as the above methods are adopted, forestry production can be rapidly developed, forest resources can be rationally utilized, and the needs of national construction for timber can be continuously supplied.

Wholeheartedly Support Our Savior, the Communist Party

Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, our ethnic minorities have gained equal status in the big family of the motherland, realized ethnic regional autonomy, and achieved rapid development in politics, economy, and culture. Our ethnic minorities have been able to get rid of the life of cattle and horses lived under the oppressive rule of the evil reactionaries for thousands of years. This is what we ethnic minorities have deeply realized. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought us ethnic minorities infinite happiness and light. We wholeheartedly thank the Party and wholeheartedly support our savior, the Communist Party of China. Those anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists are harboring ulterior motives. They are trying to alienate the relationship between our ethnic minorities and the Party, and want to drag our ethnic minorities back to the dark and tragic life before liberation, and be enslaved and manipulated by them again. We will never allow it. We are determined to join hands with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country to resolutely repel the rampant attacks of the rightists. We will always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely take the socialist road, and fight to the end for our great socialist cause.

    右派分子想奴役和摆布少数民族是办不到的
    王德安的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和大会的各项报告。现在，我就黔东南地区生产问题发表一点意见。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州的大发展
    我们黔东南地区，在党中央和国务院的领导和关怀下，于去年七月建立了黔东南苗族侗族自治州。黔东南地区解放几年来，完成了土地改革，开展了互助合作运动，生产得到很大发展。去年全州已实现了农业合作化，现在全州百分之九十五点八的农户参加了合作社，其中百分之八十七点三的农户加入了高级合作社。由于实现了农业合作化，去年虽有部分地区遭受了严重旱灾，农业生产仍然获得了丰收。粮食增产百分之七以上，现在粮食产量与一九五○年相比增长了百分之四十八点六。去年秋收分配的结果，全州有百分之八十六左右的社员增加了收入。根据镇远县文德乡的调查，一九五六年该乡每人平均收入达七十三点二九元，各种消费有了显著增加：食油一九五五年每人合八斤，一九五六年合九斤；猪肉一九五五年每人合十三斤，一九五六年合十九斤；食盐一九五五年每人合九斤，一九五六年合十一斤。锦屏县隆里乡是边沿山区，该乡新中高级社解放前缺粮户占百分之八十以上，一九五三年缺粮十五万斤，实现农业合作化后情况根本改变了，一九五五年就出卖余粮四万多斤；农民收入有很大增加，一九四九年每人平均收入约二十四元，一九五六年每人平均达五十点九四元，增加了一倍多。实现合作化的第一年就充分显示了它无比的优越性，各族人民的生活进一步得到了改善。随着生产的发展，自治州的文化教育亦有很大发展，一九五六年全州少数民族中、小学在校学生已达十三万多人，占全州学生总数的百分之六十三，少数民族子弟进不起学、读不上书的情况大大改变了。如剑河县久仰乡全乡二千零四十三户人中，在解放前仅有一人粗识文字，还是别人帮助才上小学读书的，现在的情况大变了，全乡的高初小学生就有一千四百一十人。过去黔东南地区大部分县没有医院，现在不仅县县有卫生院，而且区区有卫生所，人民的卫生条件得到很大改善。事实证明，那些别有用心的右派分子，叫喊“人民生活没有改善”、“合作化搞糟了”，完全是颠倒黑白的反党、反社会主义的荒谬言论。谎言是掩盖不住事实的，右派分子的阴谋在事实面前彻底的破产了。我们黔东南自治州贯彻执行了党和国家的民族政策，实行了民族区域自治，少数民族当家作主了，生产大大发展了，各族人民的生活大大提高了。当然，我们工作中还是有缺点的，在合作化运动高潮中，由于我们忙于组织合作社，并且把注意力集中在粮食生产方面，曾一度放松了副业生产的安排，因而农村副业生产的发展受到一定的影响，发现以后已作了纠正。现在，有的地区对耕牛饲养、管理和繁殖工作作得还不好，造成了耕牛瘦弱死亡的现象；在贯彻执行民族政策中，有的地区片面地强调了尊重少数民族“吃牯脏”的风俗习惯，而没有注意教育少数民族群众在“吃牯脏”时少宰杀耕牛，结果多宰杀了一些耕牛，影响了生产。这些缺点必须认真克服，我们要在整风运动中，认真地检查工作中的官僚主义，及时纠正缺点和错误，把工作作得更好。
    要有计划地发展黔东南地区的林业生产
    下面我想再谈一下自治州的林业生产问题。
    黔东南地区盛产木材，林地面积约四十八万公顷，森林蓄积量二千七百余万立方公尺，可伐量一千四百余万立方公尺，其中杉木占半数以上。杉木的特点是：树干高大、积材量多、木理通直、生长迅速，木质轻软、耐腐，是建筑、造船和电柱的重要用材。林区群众，特别是少数民族群众具有悠久的经营林业生产的经验，如小苗造林、林粮混作等等。他们营造的人工杉林，十五年胸高直径可达二十四点七公分，十八年即可砍伐使用，二、三十年即可长成大材，有“十八杉”之称。其生长速度，据了解要比华北的落叶松快两倍，比东北的红松快四倍。几年来，全州共为国家提供了一百一十余万立方公尺的建筑用材，支援了国家建设，增加了农民收入。单是一九五三年至一九五六年上半年，直接投入农民手中的木材价款即达一千五百余万元，加上林副产品和木材加工、流送的收入，农民的实际收入更大。据天柱县第四区的调查，一九五五年该区农民从事林业生产的收入，超过农、副业收入的总和，占全年总收入的百分之五十点七四。林业生产在黔东南人民经济生活中占很重要的地位。解放几年来，我们在造林、护林与合理开发利用森林资源方面做了不少工作，营造了用材林和经济林木一百五十余万亩；开展了群众性的护林防火工作，森林火灾大大减轻。但是由于缺乏技术指导，造林成活率很低，去年全州造林成活率平均只达百分之六十左右；乱砍乱伐和浪费木材的现象不断发生，清水江、?阳河、都柳江两岸附近的杉木几乎成片地砍光了。林业部门与森工部门工作脱节，互相配合不好，林场迹地更新工作没有作好，采伐任务又逐年增大，因此，造成伐的多、造得少，这种情况如不及时改变，就按照今年三十五万立方公尺的采伐任务（不包括群众用材）继续下去，再过十几年，黔东南地区现有的森林资源就将有被砍完的可能，对于国家建设迫切需要的木材资源将会造成很大损失。今后，我们必须全面进行生产规划，帮助合作社把林业与农业结合起来，统筹安排生产，发动群众造林、护林，节约用材，合理利用森林资源；林业部门与森工部门必须密切配合，进行合理采伐，作好林场的人工更新和天然更新工作，保证森林资源不断增长。此外，我们希望中央林业部根据黔东南地区宜植优质杉的优越条件，适当扩大国营造林，把国营造林的先进技术与当地人工营造杉林的群众经验结合起来，开展造林工作，并给黔东南地区增派一些技术人才，加强技术指导。希望中央森工部在林区兴建森林公路，整治林区河道，贯彻深采远购的方针，合理利用森林资源。我们并建议中央有关工业部门在黔东南地区建立机制纸厂，将采伐、加工的废料和不成材的林木等充分利用起来，增加纸的生产。只要采取上述办法，林业生产就可以得到很快发展，森林资源就可以得到合理利用，国家建设对木材的需要就可以源源不断的供应。
    衷心拥护我们的救星共产党
    由于党中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导，我们少数民族才在祖国的大家庭里获得了平等的地位，实现了民族区域自治，在政治、经济和文化各方面得到迅速发展，我们少数民族才得以摆脱千百年来在罪恶的反动统治压迫下过的牛马生活。这对于我们少数民族来说，是体会得最深了，共产党和毛主席给我们少数民族带来了无限的幸福和光明，我们衷心地感谢党，衷心地拥护我们的救星中国共产党。那些反党、反社会主义的右派分子，是别有用心的，他们企图离间我们少数民族和党的关系，想把我们少数民族拖回到解放前那种黑暗的悲惨生活中去，重新受他们的奴役和摆布。我们绝不容许，我们决心和全国各兄弟民族一道，坚决打退右派分子的猖狂进攻。我们永远跟着共产党、毛主席走，坚决走社会主义的道路，为我们伟大的社会主义事业奋斗到底。
