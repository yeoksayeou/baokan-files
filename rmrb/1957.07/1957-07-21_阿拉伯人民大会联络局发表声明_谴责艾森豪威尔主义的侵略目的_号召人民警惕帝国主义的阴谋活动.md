Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 20th -- According to reports in the newspapers here, the Liaison Bureau of the Arab People's Congress issued a statement on the 18th saying that the Eisenhower Doctrine is tantamount to a new form of oppression for Arab countries.

The Arab People's Congress held a meeting in Damascus from the 16th to the 18th. The statement issued after the meeting said, "Since the Arab struggle has entered a new stage, with some Arab countries gaining complete liberation from different foreign rules and their territories breaking free from the clutches of the aggressors, the oppressive imperialists are still making efforts to stop the Arab movement for freedom, sovereignty, and unity."

The Arab People's Congress was established in September 1956. At that time, representatives of national parties from most Arab countries held a meeting in Damascus and established a liaison bureau to supervise and implement the resolutions of the congress.

The statement, in condemning the Eisenhower Doctrine, said that this doctrine "forces Arab countries to submit to its will, demanding that they remain loyal and submissive, so as to hand over all their resources and wealth to the enemies who are plotting against them." The statement also condemned all measures and plans taken by the United States against Arab countries, as well as the United States' support for Israel in the Gulf of Aqaba issue.

The statement pointed out that although imperialism has successfully used various methods to open some gaps in our countries, the Arab people have proven that they are working hard to make their countries a great fortress, so that imperialism cannot invade from the outside by force, nor carry out conspiracies from within.

The statement continued, saying that the Arab people are ready to fight all imperialist forces in order to achieve all Arab goals, and will never give up until they reach their aims. The statement called on the Arab people to pay attention to all the attempts of imperialism, to be vigilant about what imperialism is planning for them with the help of certain traitors, and to oppose imperialism strengthening Israel on Arab land.

    阿拉伯人民大会联络局发表声明
    谴责艾森豪威尔主义的侵略目的
    号召人民警惕帝国主义的阴谋活动
    新华社大马士革20日电　据这里的报纸报道，阿拉伯人民大会联络局18日发表声明说，艾森豪威尔主义无异于对阿拉伯国家的一种新的压迫。
    阿拉伯人民大会从16日到18日在大马士革举行了会议。会后发表的这篇声明说，“自从阿拉伯的斗争进入了新的阶段，一些阿拉伯国家从不同的外国统治下完全获得解放以及它们的国土脱离了侵略者的魔爪以来，压迫成性的帝国主义仍然在进行努力，企图制止阿拉伯争取自由、主权和团结的运动”。
    阿拉伯人民大会是在1956年9月成立的。那时，大多数阿拉伯国家的全国性政党的代表在大马士革举行了会议，并且成立了联络局来监督和执行大会的决议。
    声明在谴责艾森豪威尔主义时说，这个主义“强迫阿拉伯国家屈从它的意志，要它们仍然忠诚和屈服，以便把它们的所有资源和财富交给在暗算它们的敌人”。声明也谴责了美国反对阿拉伯国家的一切措施和计划，以及美国在亚喀巴湾问题上支持以色列的行为。
    声明指出，虽然帝国主义成功地使用了各种方法在我们国家中打开了一些缺口，但是阿拉伯人民已证明他们在努力坚持使他们的国家成为巨大的堡垒，使帝国主义既不能用武力从外部侵入，也不能从内部实行阴谋。
    声明继续说，阿拉伯人民准备同所有帝国主义势力进行斗争，以便实现阿拉伯的所有目的，不达目的，誓不罢休。声明要求阿拉伯人留意帝国主义的所有企图，警惕帝国主义在某些卖国贼的帮助下究竟在他们身上打什么算盘，并且反对帝国主义在阿拉伯土地上加强以色列。
