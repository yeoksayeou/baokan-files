I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, as well as Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. In accordance with the national policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, and increasing production and practicing economy, I will talk about the development and existing problems of the rubber industry.

Our nation's productivity is developing vigorously, and the rubber industry is also in its ranks. Not only has the output and variety greatly increased, but the quality of products has also improved. Taking the quality of automobile tires as an example, the average mileage in 1952 was 17,000 kilometers, the national target for 1954 was 20,000 kilometers, and the target for 1955 was 25,000 kilometers. Now the average mileage has reached more than 32,000 kilometers. Thus, the average mileage of products in 1955 was 88.2 percent higher than in 1952, and it can continue to improve in the future. Such rapid development of national productivity is due to the correct leadership of the government, the technical guidance of Soviet experts, and the efforts of the workers. With the correct leadership of the government in production, something that did not exist before liberation now exists; with Soviet experts assisting in production technology with fraternal friendship, something that did not exist before liberation now exists; with workers engaging in production as masters of their own affairs, something that did not exist before liberation now exists. This fully demonstrates that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system can we achieve such great achievements in economic construction in just a few years, which is the most powerful proof.

Now I would like to talk about how to incorporate the rubber industry into the country's policy of increasing production and practicing economy:

I. Raw Materials

The application of raw materials of appropriate quality is the material foundation for improving product quality. The rubber industry uses many raw materials. Now I will use several major ones to illustrate the problem. There are also many rubber products, taking tires and rubber shoes as examples:

1. Carbon Black

Carbon black can improve the performance of rubber products, so it is an indispensable main raw material in the rubber industry. The largest consumers of raw rubber and the largest users of raw materials in China's rubber industry are tires and rubber shoes. Therefore, how to expand the use of high-quality carbon black in these two products to improve product performance and achieve maximum savings is a very important matter.

After liberation, the United States imperialists imposed an embargo on several materials to China, including carbon black. This shows that carbon black is an international strategic material. In order to be self-reliant, we began to produce it ourselves and also imported some from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries. The carbon black initially produced was of very poor quality, which affected the wear resistance of tires and resulted in low mileage. Although the quality and output are still far from meeting the requirements, they have gradually improved, and thus the quality of tires has significantly improved. Increased mileage is equivalent to a corresponding reduction in tire production, so the amount of carbon black used can also be reduced. For example, if one million 7.50-20 tires are taken, with the total mileage obtained from an average of 17,000 kilometers for 1952 products as the base, then the tires produced in 1955, due to an average mileage of 32,000 kilometers, can save 1,234 tons of carbon black, equivalent to 8,019,375 yuan.

In the production of rubber shoes, because general users habitually prefer white soles, carbon black has not been used. Although the development of microporous soles is very good in the future, it is now limited by equipment conditions, so it is recommended that carbon black of appropriate quality can also be used in large quantities on rubber shoes in the future. This will definitely greatly improve the quality of rubber shoes, extend their service life, and reduce the amount of raw rubber used in the entire rubber shoe production. On this basis, it is also possible to consider appropriately thinning the soles for even greater savings. As for the color problem, rubber shoe factories can find ways to use white rubber paste on the bottom edges of the soles to maintain the aesthetic appearance and meet the requirements of the users.

It can be seen from this that carbon black can play a role in extending the service life of both tires and rubber shoes, achieving reasonable savings.

Judging from the importance of carbon black in the rubber industry, the carbon black industry must be actively developed. China has carbon black raw material resources, which is a very good natural condition. In addition, establishing carbon black factories requires less investment and yields quick results. At the same time, China has accumulated certain production technical experience in the past few years. With so many favorable conditions, why should we not develop our own carbon black industry and instead spend a lot of foreign exchange every year to import it? In order to avoid waste, this unreasonable phenomenon should be changed. Why not develop and comprehensively plan in a timely manner?

2. Rubber

Rubber is divided into two categories: natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Synthetic rubber has various special properties, such as oil resistance and chemical resistance. With the development of science, synthetic rubber with properties similar to natural rubber can now be made. Therefore, whether from the perspective of science and technology or the needs of national defense industry, synthetic rubber must be one of the main long-term development directions in China.

China has abundant resources, including natural rubber, and has the natural conditions to develop natural rubber. The rubber used in China is mainly natural rubber, and it must continue to be developed in the future. We should study how to improve the performance of the raw materials themselves. For example, cotton fiber has been studied and can be treated with chemical drugs to improve its performance and become a very good rayon. Then, why can't natural rubber be changed to have better performance? Therefore, these tasks are hoped to be researched by Chinese scientists.

Natural rubber is divided into latex, smoked sheet rubber, and crepe rubber. Latex is gradually becoming more widely used, especially suitable for manufacturing film products and medical supplies. Using latex to impregnate tire cords can result in high product adhesion and prevent delamination. Smoked sheet rubber is used in large quantities. If it can be used reasonably, using good smoked sheet rubber in products with high-performance requirements, such as high-strength and high-wear resistance, can improve the service life. According to the above example of one million 7.50-20 tires, with the total mileage obtained from an average mileage of 17,000 kilometers for 1952 products as the base, then the average mileage of 1955 products reaching 32,000 kilometers can save 7,425 tons of raw rubber, equivalent to 43,733,250 yuan. In addition to its higher performance, smoked sheet rubber also has the advantage of being suitable for storage due to smoking, which is suitable for China's situation of still importing a large amount. Crepe rubber is divided into white crepe and brown crepe. Brown crepe rubber is generally of poorer quality, but it is cheaper. Therefore, it is economically worthwhile to use this rubber for many products with less demanding performance requirements.

There are many types of rubber, and the quality varies greatly. Therefore, selecting the appropriate rubber to use is a very important task. Various rubbers should be used rationally according to the performance requirements of various products. In this way, avoiding using high-quality materials for low-quality purposes and vice versa can overcome waste and achieve true savings.

3. Fiber

Fiber is very important in tires. It plays the role of a skeleton. The cotton cord used in tires in the early days of liberation was of poor quality. The strength of the cotton cord was only 5-6.5 kg/root, and the tires made were also not good and easily burst when driving. In recent years, the quality of cotton cord has been greatly improved, fully meeting the requirements of national quality standards, and the strength has reached 9.5 kg/root, so the phenomenon of tire bursting has been greatly reduced. This is also a major factor in improving product quality and extending service life. For example, for one million 7.50-20 tires, with the total mileage obtained from an average mileage of 17,000 kilometers for 1952 products as the base, then the average mileage of 1955 products reaching 32,000 kilometers can save 2,522.5 tons of cotton cord, worth 27,747,500 yuan. However, with the development of science and technology, in recent years, many countries have been using high-quality and inexpensive rayon and synthetic fibers in tires in large quantities. Because this fiber has high strength, fewer cord layers can be used in tires than with cotton fiber. Reducing the number of cord layers reduces the consumption of various raw materials accordingly. Taking only raw rubber as an example, reducing two layers can save 760 tons of raw rubber for one million tires, equivalent to 4,476,400 yuan.

After reducing layers, the tire becomes thinner and has better heat dissipation performance, which will improve mileage and retreading rate, so the actual savings will be even greater. At the same time, with this fiber, some high-performance aircraft tires can also be produced ourselves. China has now begun to study synthetic fibers and rayon. It is hoped that they will be successful as soon as possible, which is of great significance to national defense and economy.

There are many types of raw materials used in rubber products. From the perspective of the entire tire product, taking one million 7.50-20 tires as an example, with the total mileage obtained from an average mileage of 17,000 kilometers for 1952 products as the base, then the average mileage of 1955 products increased to 32,000 kilometers, which can save the country 134,134,000 yuan per year, and the savings will be even greater in the future.

The raw materials used in the rubber industry should pay attention to China's specific conditions and combine economy and national defense into a whole to look at the problem. Only in this way can raw materials be used comprehensively and rationally for various different products. At the same time, we should actively organize the production of raw materials that can be produced but have not yet been produced.

II. Collaboration

Every production organization must not engage in production alone or engage in work based on departmentalism. It must be the case that various departments cooperate and organically achieve close collaboration. This is the superiority of socialism in production. There are many collaboration issues. Only one or two are mentioned to illustrate:

1. Production and Experimental Research

Experimental research work is to guide production. This is a very important department. However, because China's rubber industry was mostly controlled by imperialism before liberation, they used our cheap labor to exploit us. They did not care about product quality and experimental research work. Now it has become the people's industry, of course we attach importance to this work. Because it has just begun to be established, the technical level, human resources, and other aspects are not sufficient. It is hoped that we can get more support and help so that experimental research work can truly move to the forefront of production, lead production, and be able to catch up with the world's advanced science and technology level within twelve years.

2. Commercial Profits and Industrial Profits

Two examples are given to illustrate:

(1) The allocation price of domestic carbon black is too high. Judging from the raw material sources of carbon black in China, the price of carbon black should be very cheap. The purpose of using carbon black is to improve quality on the one hand, and to reduce costs and save raw rubber on the other hand. Comparing the prices of carbon black and raw rubber, taking the United States as an example, carbon black is 16.8% of the price of No. 1 raw rubber, while in China it is 107%, and it used to be as high as 164.5%. It is very unreasonable for carbon black to be so much more expensive than raw rubber. This directly affects the mass use of production plants and the improvement of product quality, and it is not possible to save raw rubber and reduce foreign exchange.

(2) Contraception to control fertility, using rubber contraceptives is an appropriate method. The cost of this product is very low. In view of China's current situation, it is very unreasonable for the price to be high and the profit to be so large, because the vast people in rural areas cannot afford to buy it, which makes this industry unable to serve the people. This is indeed a big problem. It is understood that prices have been reduced again, which is very good, but it is still necessary to consider whether it is completely reasonable.

Regarding unreasonable prices, I think there must be many similar situations. Therefore, for this problem, I hope that all departments should look at the problem comprehensively and not simply consider the profits of their own unit.

Production is improving and the scope is expanding. In the process of development, various contradictions or problems in collaboration will occur. There are more or less such cases within each production organization itself or between various departments. If collaboration is not done well, it will become a stumbling block to the progress of production and also a wall and ditch that hinders mutual unity between various departments. The spirit of "rectification" and gentle and common discussions should be used to solve the existing contradictions and problems in collaboration. It is best to handle it within the scope of "rectification," which will greatly improve China's productivity and continue to develop vigorously.

    橡胶工业的发展与存在的问题
    林文彪的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李先念和薄一波副总理，以及张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的报告，我根据国家勤俭建国、增产节约的方针，谈一下橡胶工业的发展与存在的问题。
    我国的生产力蓬勃地向前发展，橡胶工业也在其行列中，不仅产量和品种有很大的增长，而产品质量有所提高。以汽车轮胎质量为例，一九五二年平均行驶里程为一万七千公里，一九五四年国家指标为二万公里，一九五五年指标为二万五千公里，现在平均行驶里程已达到三万二千公里以上。这样到一九五五年产品平均里程比一九五二年提高百分之八十八点二，将来还可以继续提高。整个国家生产力如此迅速发展，皆赖政府之正确领导，同时与苏联专家的技术指导及职工工作的努力都分不开的。有政府正确领导生产，解放以前没有而现在有了，有苏联专家以兄弟般友谊协助生产技术，解放以前没有而现在有了，有职工以当家作主来搞生产，解放以前没有而现在有了。足见有共产党的领导与社会主义的制度，才能在短短几年内得到经济建设现在这样的伟大成就，便是最有力的证明。
    如何将橡胶工业纳入国家的增产节约政策的问题，现在我想谈谈：
    一、原料
    应用质量适当的原材料，是产品质量提高的物质基础。橡胶工业所用的原材料很多，现在用几种主要的来说明问题。橡胶产品也很多，以轮胎与胶鞋为举例：
    ⒈炭黑
    炭黑能够改善橡胶制品的性能，所以它是橡胶工业中不可缺少的主要原料。我国橡胶工业每年消耗生胶量最大、使用原材料最多的是轮胎和胶鞋，所以如何在这两种产品中扩大使用品质优良的炭黑，以提高产品性能，达到最大的节约，是一件非常重要的事情。
    解放后美帝国主义对我国实行的禁运几项物资中就包括有炭黑，由此可知炭黑是一种国际战略物资，我们为了自力更生开始自己生产，并还从苏联及兄弟国家进口一部分。最初制造出来的炭黑质量很不好，影响轮胎不耐磨，行驶里程很低，现在虽然质量与产量还远远不能满足要求，但是已经逐步有了改进，因而轮胎质量有了显著提高，里程提高就等于相应地减少轮胎的产量，这样炭黑的使用量也可以减少。如将一百万条7.50—20轮胎，以一九五二年产品平均一万七千公里所得的总里程作为基数，则一九五五年产的轮胎因平均行驶里程提高为三万二千公里，故可以节省炭黑一千二百三十四吨，折合金额八百零一万九千三百七十五元。
    在胶鞋的生产上，因为一般用户在习惯上喜欢白颜色的鞋底，所以一直没有用炭黑，虽然将来发展用微孔鞋底很好，但因现在限于设备条件，所以建议今后在胶鞋上也能大量使用具有适当质量的炭黑。这样肯定能大大提高胶鞋质量，延长穿用寿命，整个的胶鞋生产能够减少生胶用量。在这样的基础上还可以考虑适当的将鞋底减薄，更能节约。至于颜色的问题，胶鞋厂可以从工艺上设法，利用白色胶浆涂在鞋底底边上，这样可以保持色泽美观，满足穿用者的要求。
    由此可以看出，炭黑无论是在轮胎中还是在胶鞋中都能够起到延长使用寿命的作用，达到合理的节约。
    根据炭黑在橡胶工业中的重要性来看，炭黑工业必须要积极发展。我国因为具有炭黑原料资源，这是一个很好的天然条件，再加上建立炭黑厂投资少、收效快，同时我国在过去几年里已经积累了一定的生产技术经验。有了这么多的有利条件，我们为什么不发展本国的炭黑工业而要每年再花费很多的外汇进口呢？为了避免浪费，应该改变这种不合理的现象，为什么不及时发展和全面规划呢？
    ⒉橡胶
    橡胶有天然橡胶与合成橡胶两大类。合成橡胶因为具有各种特殊性能，如耐油、耐化学药品等，随着科学的发展，已能制出在性能上与天然橡胶相近的合成胶，因此合成橡胶在我国无论是从科学技术还是从国防工业需要上来看，都必然要以合成橡胶作为今后发展的主要长远方向之一。
    我国有着丰富的资源，其中也包括有天然橡胶，具备着发展天然胶的自然条件。我国使用的橡胶是以天然胶为主，今后还必须继续发展，我们应该研究提高原料本身的性能，如棉纤维已经研究出来，可以经过化学药品处理后提高性能变成很好的人造丝，那么天然胶为什么不可以改变成更好的性能呢？所以这些工作希望我国科学家进行研究。
    天然橡胶中又分胶乳、烟片胶、绉片胶三类。胶乳在用途上逐渐广泛，特别适合于制造薄膜制品和医疗用品。在轮胎上使用胶乳浸渍帘线，因为浸透性好，所以产品附着力高，可避免脱层的现象。烟片胶用量很大，如果能够合理使用，将好的烟片胶用在性能要求高如高强力、高耐磨的产品中，可以提高寿命。按照上面的例子一百万条7.50—20轮胎，以一九五二年产品平均里程一万七千公里所得的总里程为基数，则一九五五年产品平均行驶到三万二千公里，可节约生胶七千四百二十五吨，折合金额四千三百七十三万三千二百五十元。烟片胶除了性能比较高以外，还因为经过烟熏，有适合于储藏的优点，适合我国还大量进口的情况。绉片胶又有白绉片及褐绉片两种，褐绉胶一般说来质量比较差，但是价格便宜，所以很多性能要求不太高的制品使用这种胶对经济是合算的。
    橡胶的种类很多，质量差别很大，所以选用适当的胶来使用是一种非常重要的工作，应该根据各种制品的性能要求合理使用各种橡胶，这样避免大材小用，小材大用，才能克服浪费，真正节约。
    ⒊纤维
    纤维在轮胎中是非常重要的，它起着骨骼的作用。轮胎中用的棉帘线解放初期因质量不好，棉帘线的强力仅有5—6.5公斤／根，制造出来的轮胎也不好，行驶时容易爆破。这几年棉帘线质量大大改进，完全符合国家质量指标的要求，强力已达到9.5公斤／根，所以轮胎爆破的现象大大减少，这也是产品质量提高、延长使用寿命的主要因素之一。如一百万条7.50—20轮胎，以一九五二年产品平均行驶里程一万七千公里所得的总里程作为基数，则一九五五年产品平均行驶里程到三万二千公里，可节约棉帘布二千五百二十二点五吨，价值二千七百七十四万七千五百元。但是随着科学技术的发展，近年来许多国家在轮胎中已经大量采用质量高而价格又便宜的人造纤维和合成纤维。因为这种纤维强力高，所以在轮胎中使用可以比用棉纤维的帘线层数少，帘线层数减少，各种原材料的消耗相应的就降低，只以生胶来计算，减少两层，一百万条轮胎即能节约生胶七百六十吨，折合金额四百四十七万六千四百元。
    轮胎减层后变薄，散热性能好，这样行驶里程和翻修率还会提高，这样实际节约还要多，同时有了这种纤维对有一部分性能要求高的飞机轮胎也可以自己生产了。我国现在已开始研究合成纤维与人造纤维，希望能及早成功，这在国防和经济上都有很大的意义。
    橡胶制品用的原材料种类很多，从整个轮胎产品来看，以一百万条7.50—20轮胎为例，将一九五二年产品的平均行驶里程一万七千公里所得的总里程作为基数，则到一九五五年产品平均行驶里程提高到三万二千公里，每年可为国家节约一亿三千四百一十三万四千元，将来里程继续提高，节约还要多。
    对橡胶工业用原材料应该注意我国具体情况，结合经济与国防成为一个整体来看问题，这样才能够全面、合理地将原材料使用于各种不同的产品上，同时对于可以生产而还未生产的原材料应该积极的组织生产。
    二、协作
    每一个生产机构断不可以单干来搞生产，或以本位主义来搞工作，一定要各部门分工合作，有机体地做到紧密协作的联系，这是社会主义搞生产的优越性。协作问题很多，仅提一、二来说明：
    ⒈生产与试验研究
    试验研究工作是指导生产的，这是一个非常重要的部门，但是我国橡胶工业在解放前因多受帝国主义掌握，他们利用我们便宜的劳动力进行剥削，产品质量与试验研究工作，他们是不放在心目中的。现在已成为人民的工业，当然我们重视这项工作，由于刚刚开始建立，技术水平、人力等各方面都显得很不够，希望能够多多支持帮助，使试验研究工作真正走到生产的前面，领导生产，能够在十二年内赶上世界先进科学技术水平。
    ⒉商业利润与工业利润
    现举两个例子说明：
    ①国产炭黑的调拨价格太高。从我国炭黑的原料来源各方面的情况来看，炭黑的价格是应该非常便宜的，使用炭黑的目的一方面是为了提高质量，而另一方面也是为了降低成本，节约生胶。炭黑与生胶价格比较，以美国为例，炭黑为一号生胶价格的百分之十六点八，而我国现在则为百分之一百零七，过去曾高到百分之一百六十四点五。炭黑比生胶价格高出这样多是非常不合理的，这就直接影响生产厂大量使用和改进产品质量，不能够节约生胶，减少外汇。
    ②现在避孕节制生育，以用橡胶避孕用具为一个适当的方法。这种产品成本很低，在我国目前情况来看，价格高利润这样大是非常不合理的，因为农村中的广大人民无力购买，因而使这种工业形成不能为人民服务，这确实是一个很大的问题。据了解现在又减价这是很好的，是否已经完全合理还需要考虑。
    关于价格上的不合理，我想类似这种情况一定很多，因此对于这个问题我希望各个部门都应该全面的看问题，而不要单纯的考虑本单位的利润。
    生产提高，范围放大，在发展过程中会发生各色各样协作上的矛盾或问题，每个生产机构本身或各部门之间都存在或多或少这种事例，搞不好协作将成为生产前进的绊脚石，也是阻碍各部门之间相互团结的墙和沟，应以“整风”的精神和风细雨的共同讨论来解决协作上存在的矛盾与问题，最好放在“整风”范畴内来处理更为有效，将使我国的生产力大大地提高一步，继续蓬勃地向前发展。
