Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles Pursues Rightists Inside and Outside the Party
The Reactionary Faces of Shi Baiwu, Zhang Mingquan, Sun Yuchun, Kao Cheng, and Others Are Exposed

(Our Newspaper News) The rightist elements Shi Baiwu, Sun Yuchun, and Kao Cheng of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the rightist element Zhang Mingquan inside the Party, launched vicious attacks against the Party during the rectification campaign. After being exposed and struggled against by the masses, their reactionary faces have been completely exposed.

At a forum on rectification in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Shi Baiwu shouted that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries went wrong!" and fabricated facts, saying, "Almost 100% of the people in the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles were targeted by Tian Jia (Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, one of the heads of the Five-Person Group for the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries)." He also falsely claimed that "Tian Jia was sent by the Municipal Party Committee to target people," in order to incite the masses. He shamelessly whitewashed his own reactionary activities over the past twenty years as "a revolutionary fellow traveler for the past twenty years." He stamped his feet, beat his chest, cried, and made a scene at the meeting, shouting, "Are there any traps here for us?" Communist Party member Deng Youmei replied, "Yes!" Then he shouted, "Are there any hidden arrows?" The rightist element Kao Cheng said, "Yes." The rightist elements then became deliriously happy, thinking they had an army of thousands. Shi then declared that he was determined this time to "walk on nails, go all out." Sun Yuchun also claimed to be "participating in the rectification campaign with a vengeful heart." At the meeting, she incited the masses to "attack the Party from top to bottom, inside and out," and called on responsible Party member cadres by name to speak out and "expose internal situations," inciting those whose histories had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to "take revenge," and scolding those who refused to do so as "losing their integrity."

The rightist elements also engaged in extensive activities outside the meetings. Shi Baiwu saw that Communist Party member Deng Youmei had helped him attack the Party vigorously at the meeting, so he went to him to praise him greatly, and further provoked him by saying, "Be careful they'll target you!" Sun Yuchun drafted big-character posters, mobilizing Party members to sign them, and insulted "Party members who refused to sign." She falsely accused the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles of the "three evils" being rooted in the Municipal Party Committee, inciting people to direct their anger at the Municipal Party Committee. She maliciously slandered, saying, "In what way is the Communist Party better than the Kuomintang?" Kao Cheng slandered the national suppression of counter-revolutionaries as a "dragnet," and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles as "sectarianism." He spread the word that Hu Feng was not a counter-revolutionary, and fabricated facts to say that the Communist Party oppressed intellectuals in the same way as the Kuomintang. When he saw in the newspaper that Ge Peiqi had scolded Party members and Youth League members for playing the "role of plainclothes police," he called on Youth League members to listen to him recite it, and repeatedly said, "I agree completely."

In the face of the attacks by the rightist elements, some Communist Party members lost their stance. Zhao Jian, Ge Cuilin, and others who had worked in the original Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Group openly exposed the materials of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to the rightist elements. After the rightist elements had incited some of the masses and Party members, they further seized the leadership of the rectification movement, demanding "democratic elections for the research group" to supervise the work of the leading group.

The rightist element Zhang Mingquan within the Party (member of the Creation Committee, member of the Rectification Leadership Group), proposed at the beginning of the rectification to "win over the middle masses" from the Party. He incited Party members and the masses to refuse to carry out the Municipal Party Committee's instructions on rectification. When the attacks of rightist elements such as Shi Baiwu unfolded, he openly stood with them. Zhang Mingquan mobilized Party members to sign in support of the rightist elements' demands to seize leadership of the rectification movement. After Shi Baiwu cursed the Party in a hysterical manner at the meeting, the chairman announced the adjournment, but Zhang Mingquan stopped the masses and incited them, saying, "This meeting was good! I am very excited! Very saddened! And also very happy! I also have many opinions to express!" creating a more tense atmosphere. He also supported the slander of the non-Party rightist elements, saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a concentrated expression of sectarianism within the Party," advocating the publication of all the records of the Five-Person Group. When the masses, under the leadership of the Party, launched a struggle against the rightist elements, Zhang Mingquan repeatedly emphasized "gentle breeze and fine rain," and "do not strike too hard," to obstruct the development of the struggle.

Now Zhang Mingquan's position in the leadership group has been removed, and the masses have risen up to launch a further struggle against the rightist elements inside and outside the Party.

    北京市文联追击党内外右派分子
    施白芜、张明权、孙毓椿、考诚等的反动面目暴露了
    本报讯　北京市文联的右派分子施白芜、孙毓椿、考诚，党内右派分子张明权，在整风中向党恶毒进攻。经过群众的揭发斗争，他们的反动面目已完全暴露。
    施白芜在文联整风座谈会上大叫“肃反运动搞糟了”，并捏造事实说：“市文联几乎百分之百的人都挨了田家（市文联秘书长、肃反五人小组负责人之一）的整。”并诬称：“田家是市委派来整人的”等话来煽动群众。他厚颜无耻的把自己二十多年的反动活动粉饰成为“是二十多年来革命的同路人”。在会上跌足捶胸大哭大闹，高喊：“我们这儿有没有陷阱？”共产党员邓友梅答应说“有！”又喊“有没有暗箭？”右派分子考诚说“有。”右派分子们便得意忘形的以为已有了千军万马。施便宣称这次他是下定了“滚钉板、豁出去”了。孙毓椿也自称是“抱着复仇的心情参加整风”。她在会上煽动群众对党“上下内外齐攻”，并点名要党员负责干部发言“揭露内部情况”，煽动在肃反中被查过历史的人起来“报仇”，辱骂拒绝这样作的人是“失掉气节”。
    右派分子们也在会外大肆活动。施白芜看见共产党员邓友梅在会上曾帮助他大力攻击党，就找他去大加称赞，进一步挑拨说：“你可小心人家整你！”孙毓椿起草大字报，动员党员在上面签名，并辱骂“拒绝签名的党员。她诬蔑说文联“三害”的根子在市委，煽动人们把火点到市委去。她恶毒地诬蔑说“共产党哪点比国民党强？”考诚在群众中诬蔑全国肃反运动是“瓜蔓抄”，文联的肃反运动是“宗派主义”，他向人们宣传胡风不是反革命，并捏造事实说共产党同国民党一样压迫知识分子。他看到报纸上葛佩琦骂党团员起了“便衣警察作用”时，就喊共青团员来听他朗诵，并连声说：“我太同意”。
    在右派分子们的进攻面前，有些共产党员丧失了立场。原肃反小组的工作人员赵坚、葛翠琳等人公开向右派分子们暴露肃反的材料。右派分子们煽惑了部分群众和党员之后，便进一步夺取整风运动的领导权，要求“民主选举研究小组”，监督领导小组的工作。
    党内的右派分子张明权（创作委员会委员、整风领导小组成员之一），在整风一开始就提出要同党“争取中间群众”。他煽动党员和群众拒绝执行市委关于整风的指示。等到施白芜等右派分子的进攻一展开，他就公开同他们站在一起。张明权动员党员签名支持右派分子们夺取整风领导权的要求。当施白芜在会上抢天呼地地叫骂党后，主席宣布散会，张明权又把群众拦住煽动说：“这个会开得好！我很激动！很痛心！也很高兴！也有很多意见要讲！”制造更紧张的空气。他也支持党外右派分子的诬蔑说，“肃反是党内宗派主义的集中表现”，主张公布五人小组的全部记录。当群众在党的领导下对右派分子进行斗争时，张明权又一再强调“和风细雨”，“不要打得太狠”来阻挠斗争的展开。
    现在张明权的领导小组职务已被撤销，群众已经起来对党内外右派分子展开进一步的斗争。
