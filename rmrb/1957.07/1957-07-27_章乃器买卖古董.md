Zhang Naiqi Buys and Sells Antiques
Lin Jian

Beijing is arguably the place with the highest concentration of antiques and cultural relics. Since liberation, Minister of Food Zhang Naiqi has been the leading big spender in Beijing's antique market, often seen arriving and departing in his car from antique markets like "Dong'an Market" and "Liulichang." On weekends, antique dealers frequently visited this minister's residence, where they would appraise and negotiate prices in his living room, which was filled with thousands of antiques. Add to this the several rooms packed full of antique "warehouses," and this "residence" resembled an antique exchange.

According to antique dealers, Zhang Naiqi has acquired five to six thousand antiques, large and small, worth more than 50,000 yuan since liberation. Why does Zhang Naiqi buy so many antiques? Does this minister have a special love for our country's ancient cultural relics? Zhang Naiqi himself answered this question, saying that he wanted to "see the political situation and make economic calculations." As analyzed by Zi Yaohua, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Zhang Naiqi believed that the People's Government's situation was unreliable. If the Renminbi became worthless, his property and antiques would still retain their value.

Zhang Naiqi's hoarding of antiques began in the early days of liberation. At that time, the Beijing market was sluggish, and antique prices were very low. Zhang Naiqi often bought antiques in the market for as little as 1,000 yuan (old currency). Therefore, antique dealers secretly called him "Zhang One Thousand," meaning that Zhang Naiqi specialized in buying cheap goods to take advantage and make big money. Antique dealers also told a story: One Sunday, Fei Shunshan, the antique dealer who traded the most with Zhang Naiqi, went to "Zhang's residence" and saw another antique dealer in the reception room holding a small bronze antique. It was very good, so he offered five yuan (new currency) to buy it. Later, when Zhang Naiqi found out about this, he was furious. He questioned Fei Shunshan: How could you be greedy for cheap goods in my house? Bring it to me immediately! Awed by Zhang Naiqi's power, Pei Shunshan had to give the small antique to Zhang Naiqi. Zhang Naiqi did not pay a penny and took Pei Shunshan for five yuan.

Zhang Naiqi is not only a big spender in buying antiques, but also a profiteer in selling them. Last year, he sold more than 300 pieces of porcelain and bronze ware, worth more than 1,400 yuan, to antique dealer Pei Shunshan in three batches. He also sent someone to the tax authorities to falsely claim that these three transactions were "private sales of used goods," evading more than 120 yuan in taxes.

As a minister, Zhang Naiqi's monthly salary is only a few hundred yuan. How can he buy and sell antiques worth tens of thousands of yuan? It turns out that the money he used to buy antiques was also acquired by swallowing up other people's funds, and its origins were unclear. As everyone knows, Zhang Naiqi started by blackmailing people before liberation. He used the money he obtained through blackmail to absorb some shares and organize an Upper Sichuan Enterprise Company. After liberation, this company had business activities in Shanghai and Beijing. In 1948, before liberation, he also invested some of the funds of the Upper Sichuan Enterprise Company and another enterprise to jointly establish the Hong Kong and Kowloon Real Estate Company in Hong Kong. Zhang Naiqi served as the general manager, with a monthly salary of as much as HK$1,000. This salary was still received monthly from Hong Kong until May 1950, when Zhang Naiqi had already served as a member of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council and other important positions. The rent from the real estate company's rental of houses was about more than 1,000 yuan per month, and it was also remitted to the country every month and went into Zhang Naiqi's pocket. In addition, when the Hong Kong office of the Upper Sichuan Enterprise Company closed, there was a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan, which was also remitted to him. These incomes were originally the property of the Upper Sichuan Enterprise Company, but Zhang Naiqi took them as his own and used them to purchase a large number of antiques.

People can easily see the true face of this hypocrite, who calls himself noble and claims to "not be in the same boat," from Zhang Naiqi's buying and selling of antiques alone.

    章乃器买卖古董
    林建
    北京要算是古董文物最集中的地方了，而粮食部长章乃器是解放后北京古董市场上独占鳌头的大主顾，他经常坐着小汽车出入于“东安市场”、“琉璃厂”等古玩市场。星期假日，还常常有些古玩商人来到这位部长的公馆，在那琳琅满目地陈列着上千件古玩的客厅里，看货论价；再加上那几间堆得满满的古董“仓库”，使这个“公馆”仿佛变成了古玩交易所。
    据古董商们计算，解放以来章乃器收买的大小古董有五、六千件，价值五万多元。章乃器为什么买这么多古董？是这位部长对我国古代文物有特殊爱好吗？章乃器自己的话回答了这个问题，他说要“看看政治行情，打打经济算盘”。正如民建中央委员资耀华的分析，章乃器是以为人民政府的行情靠不住的，万一人民币成了废纸，他的财产和古董还是完整值钱的。
    章乃器的囤积古董，从解放初期就开始了。当时北京市场萧条，古董价格很低，章乃器就常常以一千元（旧币）的低价在市场上收买古董，所以古董商人背地里都叫他“章一千”，意思是说，章乃器专买便宜货取巧赚大钱。古董商们还谈到一个故事，有一个星期天，同章乃器交易最多的古董商斐顺山到“章公馆”去，在传达室里看到另一个古董商拿了一件小铜器古董，很好，就出五元（新币）买下了。后来，这件事被章乃器知道了，大怒，他质问斐顺山：怎么能在我家里贪便宜货，快给我拿来！裴顺山慑于章乃器的威风，不得不把这件小古董拿给了章乃器。章乃器分文未给白白地敲了裴顺山五元竹杠。
    章乃器不仅是买古董的大主顾，而且也是抛售古董的奸商。去年他就把价值一千四百多元的瓷器、铜器共三百多件分三批卖给了古董商人裴顺山，还派人到税务机关去谎称这三笔买卖是“私人卖旧货”，偷漏了税款一百二十多元。
    章乃器作为一个部长，一个月也不过几百元的工资，怎么能成千上万元地买卖古董呢？原来他买古董的钱也是吞并别人的资金，来得不清不白的。众所周知，章乃器在解放前就是以敲诈起家的，他以敲诈的钱再吸收一部分股份组织了一个上川企业公司，解放后，这个公司在上海、北京都有业务活动。在解放前的1948年他还以上川企业公司的一部分资金和另一个企业共同投资在香港设立港九地产公司，章乃器担任总经理，每月薪金高达港币一千元，这笔薪金，直到1950年5月章乃器已经担任了中央人民政府政务院委员等要职后，依然每月由香港领取；这个地产公司出租房屋的租金，每月约一千多元，也按月汇入国内，上了章乃器的腰包；再加上上川企业公司的香港办事处结束时，还有余款一万多元，也汇给了他。这些收入本来都是上川企业公司的财产，但章乃器却占为私有，用来购置大批古董。
    人们仅仅从章乃器买卖古董的这件事情上，就不难看出这个自命清高，自称“不同流合污”的伪君子的真面目了。
