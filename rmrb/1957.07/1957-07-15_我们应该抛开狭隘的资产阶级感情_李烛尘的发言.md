I fully agree with Premier Zhou's work report and other reports.

(I)

As a representative of the National People's Congress, and as the Executive Vice Chairman of both the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I have a responsibility to denounce the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi to this assembly.

Zhang Naiqi used the opportunity of the Party's rectification campaign to spread absurd arguments time and again. These arguments caused ideological confusion among some in the industrial and commercial sectors, and brought significant losses to the socialist transformation of industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private parties in joint ventures. Examining the effect of Zhang Naiqi's motives, it is safe to say that he committed a serious crime of opposing socialist transformation.

Zhang Naiqi consistently used two-faced tactics. In his articles and speeches, he used these tactics unscrupulously to achieve the goal of inciting the industrial and commercial sectors to oppose socialist transformation. He paid lip service to doing everything possible to bring into play the initiative of industrialists and businessmen, but in reality, he was pulling them backward. He attacked dogmatism with all his might. In his article "On the Two-Sidedness of the Chinese National Bourgeoisie," the term "dogmatist" appeared as many as twenty-five times. But upon close reading, anyone would discover that the "dogmatism" he was attacking was Marxism-Leninism, the Party's basic theories on the socialist transformation of industry and commerce. Zhang Naiqi superficially portrayed bureaucracy as extremely dangerous, but in essence, he was attacking socialism and praising capitalism. In dealing with class relations, Zhang Naiqi used the tactic of beautifying the bourgeoisie (such as deliberately creating titles like "Red Bourgeoisie" and "Emerging Industrialists") to deny the leadership of the working class. I once confronted Zhang Naiqi at a joint meeting of the Standing Committees of the China Democratic National Construction Assocation and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, stating that he superficially supported Chairman Mao, but in essence opposed the Communist Party. I believe this is the most accurate criticism of Zhang Naiqi.

According to recent revelations from various sources, Zhang Naiqi used various tricks, exerted every effort to attack and win over people, and engaged in dark "small clique" activities against the Party and socialism, attempting to achieve the goal of capitalist restoration. He even shamelessly claimed that he was a "leftist," which is truly the height of shamelessness!

(II)

Now, let us take a look at the harm that the poison spread by right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi has caused to the industrial and commercial sectors and their despicable motives!

1.  Right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi do not want the industrial and commercial sectors to accept transformation.

Chairman Mao instructed us in his great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The transformation of exploiters and the transformation of laborers are two different kinds of transformation and should not be confused." But what did Zhang Naiqi say? He said: "Chairman Mao used the Marxist method, combining the dialectical nature of a series of objective things to explain the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie. Industrialists and businessmen understand (it was *he* who understood) that since every class and every person has two sides and needs to be transformed, the national bourgeoisie of course has two sides and of course needs to be transformed even more." From this, it can be seen that he was using Chairman Mao's banner to distort Chairman Mao's words in order to spread his own poison. This kind of insidious tactic is despicable. We know that the working class also transforms itself in the process of transforming society. What needs to be transformed is non-working class thinking. The task of transformation is to maintain the purity of the class essence. The transformation of the bourgeoisie is the transformation of exploiters. What needs to be transformed is the essence of the bourgeoisie, that is, the transformation of the exploiting bad roots. Zhang Naiqi deliberately said that the bourgeoisie and the working class are the same, both have two sides, and both need to be transformed. This is to confuse class boundaries, deny the essence and task of the transformation of bourgeois elements, that is, to deny continued transformation. Zhang Naiqi used this kind of argument to incite industrialists and businessmen to resist transformation and to create dissatisfaction with the Party and the government, and his intention was extremely malicious.

He also said: "What is the concept of two-sidedness that industrialists and businessmen are familiar with? That is the two-sidedness of political revolution and non-revolution, even counter-revolution, and the two-sidedness of an active side that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and a negative, five-poison side that is detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood." Who said that after the high tide, the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie was still "political revolution and counter-revolution, economic benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood and the five poisons"! In fact, this came from Zhang Naiqi's own mouth. They are using this kind of divisive tactic with ulterior motives to deny the existence of two-sidedness and deny the significance of transformation.

Two-sidedness is not immutable. Its face and content change with the changes in the national political and economic situation. Before liberation, it was manifested on the one hand in agreeing with the revolution, and on the other hand in vacillating and compromising. After liberation, on the one hand, it supported the Common Program and the Constitution, accepted the leadership of the working class, and on the other hand, it had a strong desire to develop capitalism. After the high tide, on the one hand, it became a laboring people in work, and on the other hand, it still had the identity of a capitalist, and still had fixed interest. Its economic foundation was still different from that of the laboring people. Its standpoints, views, thoughts, feelings, habits, and work style were still distant from those of the laboring people. That is to say, it has a socialist side, but at the same time it has a capitalist side. Even if there is no fixed interest, there is still the ideological imprint determined by the long-term economic status. In dealing with the socialist cause, it is not loved so deeply and so sincerely. When it encounters conflicts with personal interests, it is easy to vacillate and hesitate. The absurd arguments put forward by right-wing elements such as fixed interest for twenty years, withdrawal of public representatives, fixed interest is not exploitation, no need for transformation, etc., are considered by some to represent the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial sectors, and to speak for the industrial and commercial sectors. Is this the case? No. This is a violation of socialist principles, and it is a full explanation of two-sidedness.

What we want to transform is precisely these essential things, things that are not in line with the breathing and pulse of the working class. Isn't this a transformation of rebirth? We can only face reality and admit our shortcomings in order to transform ourselves better. Right-wing elements deny the existence of two-sidedness and deny the transformation of essence. They are bewitching us not to transform ourselves. They are spreading a big lie!

2.  Right-wing elements teach the industrial and commercial sectors to deny the leadership of the working class.

Zhang Naiqi said: "The difference between leaders and those who are led in history can only be the difference between the advanced and the backward." "The Chinese national bourgeoisie welcomes socialism! This is indeed a major event in human history." "The working class simply does not exploit and opposes exploitation." Bi Mingqi said: "Today, capitalists can no longer possess products, nor can they control products. From these two aspects, there is no difference between the status of capitalists and workers in the social production system today. The only difference is that workers have no fixed interest, and capitalists have fixed interest." On the one hand, they deny the existence of class, deny the noble qualities of the working class, and on the other hand, they beautify the bourgeoisie, as Zhang Naiqi said: "Red bourgeoisie." Bi Mingqi said: "The Chinese national bourgeoisie is great!" Zhang Naiqi also said: "The high tide is a declaration by the Chinese national bourgeoisie to the world capitalism of betraying its own class." Bi Mingqi also said: "Capitalists jumped into socialism like agile carp leaping over the dragon gate, without realizing that this class hat was still being worn"... and other fallacies. In this way, one cannot help but think: Who is this advanced class? In the minds of right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi, naturally only the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the analysis of class relations by right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi, regardless of whether they openly oppose the leadership of the working class, the only conclusion that their theory can lead to is that the working class should be led by the bourgeoisie.

Industrialists and businessmen should realize that the formation of the high tide is due to various reasons, both internal and external. Due to the education of the Party, the Chinese national bourgeoisie realized that taking the socialist road is the greatest interest of the Chinese people (including themselves), and there is no other way to go, so they accepted the transformation. This is the internal cause. On the other hand, the formation of the high tide is due to the great victory of the Five-Anti Campaign, the strength of the working class, the establishment of the leading position of the state-owned economy, the improvement of international prestige, the strong unity of the socialist camp, and a series of national economic measures, cutting off the possibility of the spread and growth of capitalism. All this made the Chinese national bourgeoisie realize that the general trend is irresistible and the people's hearts are in favor of it, and that the only way is to bring enterprises into the track of joint public-private ownership—this is the external cause. The Eighth National Congress document mentioned "accepted the transformation not too reluctantly," which means that they still accepted it with some reluctance. Is this not a fact? But regardless of internal and external causes, they were all achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, that is, the working class. Capitalism will not spontaneously enter socialism. Without the leadership of the Party, it is unthinkable!

3.  Right-wing elements teach the industrial and commercial sectors to deny exploitation.

Zhang Naiqi said: "Fixed interest is unearned income." He denies that it is exploitation. Since it is unearned, then someone is not earning or earning less. What is it if it is not exploitation?

Fixed interest is a kind of material, created by labor. It embodies the state's redemption of the means of production of the capitalists. We should realize that regardless of the means of production handed over or the fixed interest, they all belong to the workers, not something that we are entitled to share. The government gives us fixed interest in order to take care of us so that we can work, study, and transform ourselves with peace of mind. We in the industrial and commercial sectors should not think that this is a matter of course, but should work better, study better, and strive for self-transformation, in order to more smoothly eliminate capitalist ownership and eliminate fixed interest in the future.

Right-wing elements deliberately create a theory for industrialists and businessmen, saying that fixed interest is not exploitation, so it can be accepted with a clear conscience, can be taken for another thirty or fifty years, and can be taken forever. This not only destroys our confidence in demanding transformation, but also makes it impossible for our children and grandchildren to become the glorious and great working class that we dream of day and night. This is something that the working class will never allow, and it is also something that our bourgeoisie cannot allow!

4.  Right-wing elements sow discord between the industrial and commercial sectors and the Party and the government, want us to oppose the leadership of the Party, and want us to abandon the socialist road.

Right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi are accustomed to using "dogmatists" and "coercion" to slander the Party's teachings to us. The dogmatists they are referring to are those who reason with us and who resolutely fight back against their anti-socialist remarks. Right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi are selling revisionism under the guise of anti-dogmatism and distorting the truth of Marxism-Leninism. Zhang Naiqi said: "Marxists-Leninists never deify or demonize a person or a class." He believes that the Party is demonizing the bourgeoisie. Right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi said: "The Five-Anti Campaign made the bourgeoisie feel inferior." Bi Mingqi said: "The sense of inferiority is caused by class relations." He believes that the contradiction between workers and capitalists is caused by the Communist Party. Therefore, he said that the only way to solve it is: "The one who tied the bell must untie it." The sense of inferiority exists in some industrialists and businessmen, but this is precisely a manifestation of the backward side of clinging to capitalism. Is it not because of clinging to the past emotions of "I have the final say," "occupying the mountain as king," and "the present is not as good as the past"? The only way to overcome the sense of inferiority is to strengthen the sense of responsibility for the socialist cause and earnestly accept transformation. When socialist thought occupies a major position in our minds, the sense of inferiority will disappear. Right-wing elements are alarmist. Their most central purpose is to make us oppose the leadership of the Party.

Right-wing element Zhang Naiqi has always been good at hiding his tail, but this time he has exposed a lot, such as saying: "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." Bureaucracy is a bad work style, and capitalism is a social system. The two are fundamentally different in nature. How can they be compared? The purpose of his comparison is nothing else. The bureaucracy he is referring to is socialism, and what he is praising is capitalism. Why does he have to say this? Isn't it very obvious? He said: "At present, the ideological education for industrialists and businessmen should be to fully eliminate their sense of inferiority and vigorously inspire their initiative." "In addition to seeking profit, capitalists also have a kind of entrepreneurial spirit." Connecting it with what he said earlier, what he wants to bring into play is the exploitative talent of capitalists, the profit-seeking initiative of capitalism, not the initiative of socialism. What he wants to bring into play are precisely those negative things. Their only purpose is to revive the dead capitalism in China and return to the historical stage! In other words, they want to transform the world with their bourgeois ideas!

(III)

The facts are very obvious: Everything that the right-wing elements deny is exactly everything that we have already obtained, or are striving to obtain soon. They are destroying our future. They have taken advantage of the characteristics of the negative side of the industrial and commercial sectors and some legitimate dissatisfaction with the work, exaggerated and poisoned them, sowed discord and incited us to take the old road. We should shout loudly: Right-wing elements, give up! The great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the people of the whole country in socialist construction and socialist transformation over the years are supported by any patriotic industrialist or businessman. We in the industrial and commercial sectors are satisfied and convinced by the Communist Party's policy toward the Chinese national bourgeoisie. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism; without the Communist Party, it would be even more impossible for the Chinese national bourgeoisie to achieve peaceful transformation. Today, our industrial and commercial sectors have formed an inseparable relationship with the Communist Party and the socialist cause. This relationship will only become stronger and stronger. It is impossible to pull us away from the Communist Party and take the old road!

Comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors, we should abandon our narrow-minded bourgeois sentiments. We should learn the working class's standpoints, viewpoints, methods, ideology, habits, work style, breathing and pulse, what to love and what to hate... We should be good at distinguishing who is the enemy and who is the friend. Right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi have consistently opposed the Party and opposed socialism. The industrial and commercial sectors are severely criticizing and exposing their anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions. From the preliminary revealed materials, they represent the negative and ugly side of the bourgeoisie in a concentrated way, and are running counter to our socialist road. Comrades in the industrial and commercial sectors, this movement is a serious test for us. Let us resolutely smash the reactionary activities of the right-wing elements and advance rapidly on the socialist road!

Finally, I want to warn Zhang Naiqi again. Chairman Mao said in his report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, how should we judge the right and wrong of our words and actions in the political life of our people? …The most important of these six criteria are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. Zhang Naiqi today is no longer a question of being beneficial to socialist transformation and consolidating the leadership of the Party, but opposing socialism and opposing the leadership of the Party, and has become a matter of not dealing with contradictions among the people!

Zhang Naiqi usually claims to be a theorist and a Marxist. How can he not know the socialist road and the leadership of the Party? It is hateful that he deliberately made the above-mentioned divisive, provocative, incitive, and slanderous remarks and actions. During the period of helping the Party rectify the style of work, he dared to talk nonsense in front of the clear eyes of the masses, so naturally his ugly face was exposed. However, in the anti-rightist struggle, regardless of the large or small meetings, after the masses exposed him, Zhang Naiqi remained stubbornly unmoved, stubbornly arrogant, and refused to confess his crimes. The two standing committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have already given him the punishment of suspension of duties for review, but he has ignored it so far. Zhang Naiqi can be said to be the most rogue and shameless among all the right-wing elements. Even the newspapers reported Zhang Naiqi's ugly words and deeds. After reading the newspapers, everyone can understand what kind of thing he is! The two standing committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will continue to wage a relentless struggle against Zhang Naiqi. We will never give up until he honestly takes off his pants and fully confesses his crimes. There are two ways to struggle: one is to persuade, and the other is to coerce. If Zhang Naiqi is incorrigible and refuses to confess, of course we are not willing to coerce you. The two standing committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will request the government to thoroughly investigate and punish you according to law. The decision is up to you.

### 我们应该抛开狭隘的资产阶级感情  李烛尘的发言

专栏：

    我们应该抛开狭隘的资产阶级感情
    李烛尘的发言
    我完全同意周总理的工作报告和其他各项报告。
    （一）
    作为全国人民代表大会的代表，作为中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会的常务副主任委员，我有责任要向大会控诉章乃器等右派分子的反党反社会主义的言行。
    章乃器利用党整风的机会，一次又一次地散播荒谬论调，这些论调曾经造成一部分工商界的思想混乱，给工商业者的社会主义改造和合营企业中的公私共事关系带来了重大的损失，从效果检查章乃器的动机，肯定的说：他是犯了严重地反社会主义改造的罪行。
    章乃器一贯地使用两面派的手法，在文章和发言中，他肆无忌惮地使用这种手法来达到鼓动工商界反对社会主义改造的目的。他口口声声说为了千方百计地发挥工商业者的积极性，但实际上是拉着他们走回头路。他用全力攻击教条主义，在“关于中国民族资产阶级的两面性问题”一文中，“教条主义者”这个名词竟出现了二十五次之多，但细细阅读时，谁都会发现他所攻击的“教条主义”，就是马列主义，就是党的有关工商业社会主义改造的基本理论。章乃器在表面上把官僚主义说得如何如何危险，但实质上是在攻击社会主义，颂扬资本主义。章乃器在对待阶级关系上是用美化资产阶级的手法（如故意制造出“红色资产阶级”“新兴工业家”等称号）来否认工人阶级的领导。我有一次在民建和工商联的常委联席会议上曾经面斥章乃器表面上拥护毛主席，实质上反对共产党，我认为这是对章乃器的最确切的批评。
    根据最近各方面人士的揭发，章乃器使用各种伎俩，极尽打击拉拢的能事，阴暗的在搞反党反社会主义的“小集团”活动，企图达到资本主义复辟的目的。他还恬不知耻的说他是“左派”，真是无耻已极！
    （二）
    现在，请大家来看看章乃器等右派分子散播的毒素对工商界的危害性和他们的卑鄙目的吧！
    一、章乃器等右派分子不要工商界接受改造
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这篇伟大的著作中指示我们：“剥削者的改造和劳动者的改造是两种不同性质的改造，不能混为一谈。”但章乃器如何说呢？他说：“毛主席所用的是马克思主义的方法，是结合着一系列的客观事物的辩证性质来说明民族资产阶级的两面性的。工商业家理解到：（是他理解到）既然什么阶级什么人都有两面性，都需要改造，民族资产阶级当然有两面性，当然更需要改造。”由此可见，他打着毛主席的旗号，歪曲毛主席的言论，以便于传播自己的毒素，这种用心阴险的手法是卑鄙的。我们知道工人阶级在改造社会中也改造自己，所要改造的是非工人阶级思想，改造的任务是保持阶级本质的纯洁，资产阶级的改造是剥削者的改造，它所要改造的是资产阶级本质的东西，即剥削劣根性的改造。章乃器故意说资产阶级同工人阶级一样，都有两面性，都需要改造，是混淆阶级界限，是否认资产阶级分子改造的实质与任务，也就是否认继续改造。章乃器就是以这种论调来煽动工商界抗拒改造及对党、政府的不满情绪，用意是十分恶毒的。
    他又说：“工商业家所熟知的两面性的概念是什么？那是政治上革命与不革命甚至反革命的两面性，和经济上有利于国计民生的积极一面与不利于国计民生的消极五毒一面的两面性。”谁说过高潮后民族资产阶级两面性还仍然是“政治上的革命与反革命，经济上的有利于国计民生和五毒”！实际上这是出于章乃器自己之口。他们是别有用心的用这种挑拨的手法来达到否认两面性的存在，否认改造的意义。
    两面性不是一成不变的，它的面貌内容都是随着国家政治经济形势的变化而变化的。表现在解放前一方面赞同革命，一方面又动摇妥协，解放后一方面拥护共同纲领、宪法、接受工人阶级领导，一方面又有强烈的发展资本主义的愿望；高潮后，一方面在工作上成为劳动人民，一方面又具有资本家的身份，还有定息，与劳动人民的经济基础还不一样，立场观点，思想感情，生活习惯，工作作风与劳动人民还有距离，既是说有社会主义的一面，同时还有资本主义的一面。即使没有了定息，也还有长期以来的经济地位所决定的思想烙印，在对待社会主义事业上不是爱之那么深那么切，遇到同个人利益发生矛盾时，容易发生动摇犹豫。右派分子提出的定息二十年，撤退公股代表，定息不是剥削，不要改造了等等的荒谬言论，有人认为是代表工商界的合法利益，是替工商界说话，是这样子吗？不是的。这是违反社会主义原则的，也正是两面性的十足说明。
    我们所要改造的正是这些本质的东西，既与工人阶级呼吸、脉搏不一致的东西，难道这不是脱胎换骨的改造吗？我们只有正视现实，承认缺点，才能更好地改造。右派分子否认两面性存在，否认本质的改造，是在蛊惑我们不要改造，是在撒弥天大谎！
    二、右派分子教工商界否认工人阶级的领导
    章乃器说：“历史上的领导者与被领导者的区别，都只能是先进与落后的区别。”“中国民族资产阶级却反而欢迎社会主义！这的确是人类历史上一件大事。”
  “工人阶级只是不剥削和反剥削。”毕鸣岐说：“今天资本家也不能占有产品了，也不能支配产品了，从这两个方面来看，资本家和工人今天在社会生产体系中的地位是没有什么区别的，唯一的区别就是工人没有定息，资本家有定息。”他们一方面否认阶级存在，否认工人阶级的高贵品质，一方面美化资产阶级，如章乃器说：
  “红色资产阶级。”毕鸣岐说：“中国民族资产阶级是伟大的！”章乃器又说：“高潮是中国民族资产阶级向世界资本主义宣告背叛自己阶级的起义。”毕鸣岐又说：
  “资本家们以矫健的鲤鱼跳龙门式跳入社会主义，没有想到这顶阶级帽子还带着”……等等谬论。这样一来，使人不能不想到：这个先进的阶级到底是谁呢？在章乃器等右派分子的心目中，自然只有资产阶级了。所以，章乃器等右派分子对阶级关系的分析，不管他们有没有明目张胆地反对工人阶级领导，但他们的理论所能得出的唯一的结论，就是应当由资产阶级来领导工人阶级。
    工商业者应当认识：高潮的形成是由于各方面的原因，有内因也有外因。由于党的教育，中国民族资产阶级认识到走社会主义道路是中国人民（包括自己在内）的最大利益，别的也没路可走，因而接受了改造。这是内因。另一方面高潮的形成是由于五大运动的巨大胜利，工人阶级力量的强大，国营经济的领导地位的确立，国际威望的提高，社会主义阵营的坚强团结以及国家一系列的经济措施，割断了资本主义蔓延滋长的可能，这一切使得中国民族资产阶级认识到大势所趋，人心所向，只有把企业纳入公私合营的轨道——这是外因。八大文件提到“不太勉强的接受了改造”即是说还带有一些勉强的接受，难道不是事实吗？但是不论内因和外因都是在中国共产党即工人阶级的领导下取得的，资本主义是不会自发的走入社会主义的，没有党的领导是不堪设想的！
    三、右派分子教工商界否认剥削
    章乃器说：“定息是不劳而获的收入”，他否认是剥削，既是不劳而获，就有人劳而不获或劳而少获，不是剥削又是什么呢？
    定息是一种物质，是劳动创造的，它体现着国家对资本家生产资料的赎买。我们应该认识不管交出的生产资料也罢，定息也罢，都是属于工人的，不是理所当然享之有份的。政府所以给我们定息，是为了照顾我们能够有条件安心工作，安心学习，安心改造。我们工商界不应该认为这是理所当然，而应该更加工作得好，学习得好，努力自我改造，为了将来更顺利的消灭资本家所有制，消灭定息。
    右派分子故意给工商业者制造一种理论，说定息不是剥削，这样可以受之无愧，可以再拿三十年、五十年，可以永远的拿下去。这样不但断送了我们要求改造的信心，连我们的子孙也永无成为我们日夜想望的光荣的伟大的工人阶级的一天，这是工人阶级绝不容许，也是我们资产阶级不能容许的！
    四、右派分子挑拨离间工商界与党和政府的关系，要我们反对党的领导，要我们放弃走社会主义的道路
    章乃器等右派分子惯用“教条主义者”“压服”来诬蔑党对我们的教导，他们所指的教条主义者是指的向我们讲道理的人，是坚决回击他们这些反社会主义言论的人。章乃器等右派分子在打着反教条主义的幌子进行着修正主义的贩卖，在歪曲着马列主义的真理。章乃器说：“马列主义者绝不神化或魔化一个人或一个阶级”，他认为党在魔化资产阶级。章乃器等右派分子说：“五反使资产阶级产生了自卑感”。毕鸣岐说：“自卑感是阶级关系造成的”，他认为：工人和资本家的矛盾是共产党造成的，因此他说解决的办法只有：“解铃还得系铃人”。自卑感在部分工商业者中是存在的，但这正是留恋资本主义的落后的一面的表现，难道不是因为留恋过去“我说了算”“占山为王”“今不如昔”等情绪的流露吗？克服自卑感的办法只有加强对社会主义事业的责任感，认真接受改造，当社会主义思想在我们头脑中占了主要地位的时候，自卑感即不存在了。右派分子危言耸听，他们最中心的目的，是要我们反对党的领导。
    右派分子章乃器一向善于隐蔽自己的尾巴的，但这次却暴露得很多，如他说：“官僚主义比之资本主义是更危险的敌人。”官僚主义是一种坏的工作作风，资本主义是一种社会制度，两者性质根本不同，怎么可以相比呢？他用以比较的目的不是别的，他所指的官僚主义即是社会主义，他所赞扬的是资本主义，他为什么硬要这样说，这不是很明显的吗？他说：“目前对工商业家的思想教育，应该是充分消除他们的自卑感，大力启发他们的积极性。”“资本家除了图利之外，还有一种企业心。”与他前边所讲的联系起来，他所要发挥的是资本家的剥削才能，是资本主义唯利是图的积极性，不是社会主义的积极性，他所要发挥的正是那些消极的东西。他们的唯一目的是让已死亡的资本主义在中国复活，重新登上历史舞台！也就是想用他们的资产阶级的思想来改造世界！
    （三）
    事实非常明显：右派分子所否定的一切正是我们所已得到的一切，或努力即将得到的一切，他们在毁灭着我们的前途，他们利用了工商界消极一面的特点和工商界对工作上的某些正当的不满，加以渲染毒化，离间挑拨，让我们走回头路。应当大喝一声：右派分子死心吧！几年以来中国共产党领导全国人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业上所获得的伟大成绩，任何一个爱国的工商业者都拥护的，共产党对中国民族资产阶级的政策，我们工商界是满意的、信服的。没有共产党，就没有新中国；没有共产党也没有社会主义；没有共产党，中国民族资产阶级更不可能得到和平改造。我们工商界今天已经同共产党、同社会主义事业结成分不开的关系，这种关系只有愈来愈巩固。想拉我们离开共产党走回头路是不可能的！
    工商界的同志们，我们应该抛开狭隘的资产阶级感情，应该学习工人阶级的立场、观点、方法、思想意识、生活习惯、工作作风，呼吸脉搏，爱什么恨什么……。我们应该善于分辨何者为敌、何者为友，像章乃器、毕鸣岐等右派分子一贯反对党、反对社会主义，对于他们反党反社会主义的言行，工商界正在进行严厉的斥责与揭发，从初步揭发的材料看，他们集中的代表了资产阶级消极丑恶的一面，同我们走社会主义道路是背道而驰的。工商界的同志们，这次运动对我们是一个严重的考验，让我们坚决粉碎右派分子的反动活动，在社会主义大道上迅速前进吧！
    最后，我要再一次警告章乃器，毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题报告中说，在我国人民政治生活中应当怎样来判断我们的言论和行动是非呢？……这六条标准中最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导。章乃器今天已经不是有利于社会主义改造和有利于巩固党的领导问题，而是反对社会主义、反对党的领导，且已经成为不是处理人民内部问题了！
    章乃器平日自命为理论家和马克思主义者，社会主义道路和党的领导何尝不知，明知之而故意作出上述种种挑拨离间煽惑诬蔑言论和行动，可恨之处就在这里。在帮助党整风期间，也是天夺其魄，敢于在群众雪亮的眼睛前胡说八道，那自然就你的丑恶面貌自行暴露了。但在反右派斗争中，无论大会小会经过群众的揭发，章乃器竟悍然无动于中，顽强骄横拒不交代。民建和工商联两常委会对他均已作了停职检讨的处分，但他迄今尚置之不理。章乃器在各右派分子中可谓无赖之尤，无耻之极。连日报载章乃器丑恶言行，大家看报后可了解他是一个什么东西！民建、工商联两常委会还要继续和章乃器作无情斗争。他不老老实实脱下裤子尽情交代，绝不罢休。斗争的方式有两种，一是说服，一是压服。章乃器如不可理喻拒不交代，我们当然不愿压服你，民建、工商联两常委会，将要求政府彻底检查依法制裁。何去何从待你自决。
