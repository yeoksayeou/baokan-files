Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: Here, on July 21st, a celebration was held for Poland's National Day (the thirteenth anniversary of the publication of the Polish Committee of National Liberation's manifesto). Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, leaders and representatives from all walks of life in Poland, as well as Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who is currently visiting Poland, and his entourage, attended the celebration.

　　The meeting began with a speech by Gomulka. He said that thirteen years ago, fundamental changes took place in our country, and power was transferred to the people led by the working class, and a new socialist chapter began in the history of the Polish state. In the past thirteen years, we have come a long way. Despite the mistakes made along the way, despite the current difficulties, the people's regime, the working class, and all working people still have every right to be proud of the path they have taken and the achievements they have made in the past period. The Polish United Workers' Party, as the leading party, has led the great cause of transforming our lives according to the lofty ideals of socialism and will continue to lead this cause in the future. On the National Day of People's Poland, our party has the right to say that it has honorably fulfilled its basic obligations to the working class, to all working people, to the Polish people, and to the principles of proletarian internationalism with a high sense of responsibility.

　　Gomulka said that for a long time, how many enemies of socialism have been hoping that the people's regime in Poland would collapse under the pressure of economic difficulties, but it did not collapse in the past, and it will not collapse now. Those who once hoped, and still hope today, that the past will return have forgotten the development of history. Poland is moving forward more and more steadily and confidently, and Poland will move towards socialism more and more rapidly.

　　Gomulka said that as we enter the fourteenth year of People's Poland, we understand the difficult tasks we face. We understand what methods should be adopted to continue to advance victoriously along the road of building socialism. We have already formulated this method at the Eighth and Ninth Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and we can also say with satisfaction that the vast majority of the people of the country agree with this method and agree with the path we have planned.

　　Next, Cyrankiewicz made a report commemorating Poland's National Day. He said that the declaration issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation thirteen years ago was the program for building the people's regime. We are perseveringly implementing this program. He also said that the declaration emphasized the need to strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union, and we have adhered to this principle. Our relations with our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, are based on the principles of equality and friendship, and this relationship is constantly consolidated and developed.

　　When talking about Poland's foreign policy, Cyrankiewicz pointed out that this policy is a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp. He said that this is a policy of peace. This policy guarantees our sovereignty, our borders, and our continuous progress.

　　President Ho Chi Minh also spoke at the meeting. He said that during these thirteen years, the Polish people have overcome many difficulties on the road of building socialism. This is not only a great victory for the Polish people, but also a victory for the Vietnamese people, the socialist camp, and the victory for the camp of peace and democracy. Ho Chi Minh concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people are convinced that the Polish people, under the wise leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, will continue to carry forward their heroic traditions and achieve even more magnificent victories in the future.

　　From July 19th, celebrations for National Day have been held throughout Poland. Polish party and government leaders have gone to various places to participate in the celebrations.

　　On July 21st, representatives of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the State Council, and various parties and organizations also laid wreaths at the cemetery of Soviet soldiers.

    波兰全国欢度国庆节
    哥穆尔卡指出波兰将加速走向社会主义
    西伦凯维兹强调坚持同苏联友好的原则
    据新华社华沙22日电　这里在7月21日举行了波兰国庆节（波兰民族解放委员会发表宣言十三周年）的庆祝会。哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、波兰各界的领袖和代表，以及正在波兰访问的越南民主共和国主席胡志明和他的随行人员都参加了这次庆祝会。
    会议首先由哥穆尔卡讲话。他说，十三年以前，我们国家里发生了根本变化，政权转移到工人阶级领导的人民手中，在波兰国家的历史中新的社会主义的一章开始了。在过去十三年里，我们走了很长一段路。尽管在这条路上犯过错误，尽管目前还存在着困难，人民政权、工人阶级和全体劳动人民仍旧有充分的权利为过去一个时期所走过的路程和取得的成就感到自豪。作为领导党的波兰统一工人党，领导了根据社会主义崇高理想改造我们生活的伟大事业，今后将继续领导这一事业。在人民波兰的国庆纪念日，我们的党有权利说，它已经怀着高度责任感光荣地履行了它对工人阶级、对全体劳动人民、对波兰全国人民和对无产阶级国际主义原则所应尽的基本义务。
    哥穆尔卡说，长期以来，有多少社会主义的敌人一直希望着波兰的人民政权会在经济困难的压力下崩溃瓦解，但是，过去它没有崩溃，现在更不会崩溃。那些曾经希望、而且今天仍旧希望着过去会重来的那些人是忘记了历史的发展。波兰正越来越稳步而有信心地向前迈进，波兰将越来越迅速地向社会主义迈进。
    哥穆尔卡说，在进入人民波兰的第十四年的时候，我们了解我们所面临的困难任务。我们了解应该采取什么方法继续沿着建设社会主义的道路胜利前进。我们已经在波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八、第九两次全体会议上制订了这种方法，我们也能够满意地说，全国人民绝大多数同意这种方法，同意我们所策划出来的道路。
    接着，西伦凯维兹作了纪念波兰国庆节的报告。他说，十三年前波兰民族解放委员会发表的宣言是建设人民政权的纲领。我们正在坚忍不拔地实现这个纲领。他又说，宣言强调必须加强同苏联的友好，我们坚持了这个原则。我们同伟大邻邦苏联的关系是建立在平等和友好的原则之上的，这种关系在不断巩固，不断发展。
    在谈到波兰的外交政策的时候，西伦凯维兹指出，这个政策是同苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国友好的政策。他说，这是和平的政策。这个政策保障着我们的主权，我们的边界，我们的不断进步。
    胡志明主席也在会上讲了话。他说，在这十三年的期间，波兰人民在建设社会主义的道路上克服了许多困难。这不仅是波兰人民的伟大胜利，而且也是越南人民的胜利，社会主义阵营和和平民主阵线的胜利。胡志明最后说，越南人民确信，波兰全国人民在波兰统一工人党的英明领导下，将继续发扬他们英勇的传统，在今后取得更加宏伟的胜利。
    从7月19日起，波兰全国各地都在举行庆祝国庆的集会。波兰党政领导人员分别到各地去参加庆祝活动。
    波兰统一工人党中央、国务委员会以及各党派团体的代表7月21日还曾到苏军战士墓前献了花圈。
