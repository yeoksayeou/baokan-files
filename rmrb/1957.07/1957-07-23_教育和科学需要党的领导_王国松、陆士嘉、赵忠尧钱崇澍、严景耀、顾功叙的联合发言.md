We wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and we fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports.

Our country is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and it unswervingly follows the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Just as the socialist revolution has achieved basic victory and socialist construction has also achieved great results, the bourgeois right-wing elements have taken the opportunity of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign to issue various anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies, and even take actions that are detrimental to the socialist cause, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and sabotage the socialist cause. This is what we firmly oppose.

Now we will talk about the following two issues:

I. The Issue of Party Leadership in Education and Science

Since the readjustment of departments in universities, strengthening the leadership of the Party, strengthening political and ideological education, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and carrying out teaching reforms have changed the face of the old China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial education. Many new majors have been added, and a large number of construction talents have been trained to meet the needs of national construction and the rapid development of the national economy. The achievements are definite. This is inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Of course, in the teaching reform, due to our lack of experience, some deviations have also occurred, such as when learning from the Soviet Union, the combination with China's actual situation was not enough, pursuing quantity and neglecting quality, etc. The right-wing elements took the opportunity to weaken the Party's leadership, restore the bourgeois education of the old China's British and American style, guide young students to develop individualistic ideas, and one-sidedly emphasize studying professional work, detaching from politics. This is completely wrong. How can students trained in this way wholeheartedly serve the people and cooperate with the needs of national socialist construction? We believe that in the current work of improving teaching and improving teaching quality, the leadership of the Party is needed. Especially from the situation exposed in the recent rectification movement, we must strengthen political and ideological education work, and therefore, it is even more necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party.

In the past eight years, China's scientific undertaking has developed rapidly under the leadership of the Party. The Party Central Committee's call to "march towards science" has given scientific workers great encouragement. The formulation of the 1956-1967 Scientific Development Long-Range Plan pointed out the general outline and path for the development of China's scientific undertaking, and solved the scientific and technological problems in production. The Party and the government have continuously strived to prepare conditions for scientific workers, and scientific workers are striving to complete this plan. Some people believe that China's scientific undertaking has regressed since liberation and that it is necessary to make up for the past twelve years. Such a statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. Let us not mention that since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, a large number of scientific cadres have been trained, many scientific institutions have been established, and research equipment has been enriched. Even from the scientific works that can represent scientific research achievements, the specialized scientific journals before liberation often lacked sources of manuscripts, and most of them published theoretical works. Now the situation is different. Various journals can choose to publish due to sufficient sources of manuscripts, and the content is much richer than before. This shows that China's scientific research work has made great progress both in quantity and quality compared with before. Not only that, but on the basis of new talents and equipment, the bright prospects of China's scientific research undertaking have been seen. The days of hoping to make science take root in the land of China are coming soon. Some people say that the Party cannot lead science, and propose that "outsiders" cannot lead "insiders." This statement is even more wrong. The Scientific Development Long-Range Plan is a typical example of scientists cooperating under the leadership of the Party and the government. To cooperate with the national economic development plan, a scientific plan is needed. Without a scientific development long-range plan, it is impossible to make China's science approach or catch up with the advanced international level. We believe that the Party can lead science, and science needs the leadership of the Party. Political ideology, policies, guidelines, and plans all need the leadership of the Party and the government.

II. On the Issue of the Transformation of Intellectuals

At the beginning of this rectification movement, our intellectuals' political sense was too insensitive. When the evil wind rose, many intellectuals felt that something was wrong, but they could not see that this was an anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy, and immediately stood up to fight. Some of us viewed the right-wing elements with our "good intentions." This "good intention" is actually low political consciousness. It was not until the workers and peasants came out to speak that they saw the reactionary nature of the words and deeds of the right-wing elements, and then they joined the battle, drew a clear line with the right-wing elements, tempered themselves in the battle, and improved themselves. We have seen that some intellectuals are willing to be used by the right-wing elements without realizing it, some are used unconsciously, and some intellectuals have a strong bourgeois ideology and become a market for the right-wing to spread fallacies.

In this struggle against the right-wing, we intellectuals increasingly feel that we have already entered socialism, but our thinking has not yet entered socialism. We have made progress in past ideological transformations, but our study of Marxism-Leninism has mostly stayed in books and has not been well integrated with practice, and we have rarely been tempered in practice. Chairman Mao timely gave us intellectuals an instruction, saying that in order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society and to unite with workers and peasants, intellectuals must transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian and communist world outlook.

Educating young people and imparting knowledge is the glorious task of our scientific workers and educators. In the process of educating young people and imparting knowledge, we inevitably impart our style, habits, and views to young people. Therefore, school teachers have the glorious title of soul engineers for cultivating the next generation. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without correct political views, it is equivalent to having no soul." If we teachers cannot master the proletarian ideological weapon, cannot stand firm in the storms of class struggle, and cannot distinguish right from wrong, then we have no soul; if we have no soul ourselves, how can we be qualified to be "soul engineers"! At present, we all demand to strengthen political and ideological education for young people. On the one hand, we must improve the teaching materials and methods of political education to avoid detaching from reality, but more importantly, teachers must strive to master correct political views, strengthen their labor views, gradually integrate with workers and peasants, and improve socialist consciousness. Only in this way can young students, in the process of subtle education, become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness.

In this struggle against the right-wing, we deeply realize that the ideological transformation of intellectuals is not only very necessary, but also a long-term, meticulous, and regular task. Only by grasping ideological transformation and constantly striving can we intellectuals complete the transformation of our world outlook, align our steps, stand firm, and, under the strong leadership of the Party, play our due strength in the tenacious struggle to build socialism.

    教育和科学需要党的领导
    王国松、陆士嘉、赵忠尧钱崇澍、严景耀、顾功叙的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告，并完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，坚定不移地在中国共产党领导下走社会主义道路。正当社会主义革命取得了基本胜利、社会主义建设也获得了巨大成绩的时候，资产阶级右派分子却乘中国共产党整风的机会，发出种种反党反社会主义的谬论，甚至采取不利于社会主义事业的行动，企图推翻中国共产党的领导，破坏社会主义事业。这是我们所坚决反对的。
    现在我们来谈谈以下两个问题：
    一、党领导教育和科学的问题
    高等学校自院系调整后，加强党的领导，加强政治思想教育，学习苏联先进经验，进行教学改革，改变了旧中国半封建半殖民地教育的面貌，增加了许多新的专业，培养出大量建设人才，以适应国家建设及国民经济迅速发展的需要，成绩是肯定的。这与党的领导是分不开的。当然，在教学改革中，由于我们的经验不够，也发生过若干偏差，如学习苏联的时候，结合中国实际情形不够，追求数量忽视质量等等。右派分子却乘机想削弱党的领导，恢复旧中国英美式的资产阶级的一套教育，引导青年学生发展个人主义思想，片面强调钻研业务，脱离了政治。这是完全错误的。这样培养出来的学生，怎样能全心全意为人民服务、配合国家社会主义建设的需要呢？我们认为在目前改进教学、提高教学质量工作中，需要党的领导。特别从最近整风运动暴露出来的情况来看，我们必须加强政治思想教育工作，因此，更有加强党的领导的必要。
    八年来，中国科学事业在党的领导下有了迅速的发展，党中央提出“向科学进军”的号召给科学工作者以莫大的鼓舞。1956—1967年科学发展远景规划的制订指出我国科学事业发展大体的轮廓和途径，解决生产上科学技术的问题。党和政府不断努力为科学工作者准备条件，科学工作者正在为完成这个计划而奋斗。有人认为解放以来中国科学事业反而退步了，需要补过去十二年的课。这样的说法是完全不符事实的。我们姑且不说解放以来在党和政府的领导下，已经培养了大批科学干部，建立了不少科学机构，充实了研究设备，就是从可以代表科学研究成绩的科学著作来看，解放以前专门的科学期刊，经常稿源不足，登载的大都是理论性的著作，现在情况就不同了，各种期刊由于稿源充足，可以选择登载，内容也比以前充实得多。这就可说明我国的科学研究工作无论在数量上或质量上都比以前大有进步。不但如此，在新的人才与设备基础上，我国科学研究事业的光明前景，已经见到，过去所想望的要使科学在中国土地上生根子的日子，即将到来。有人说党不能领导科学，提出“外行”不能领导“内行”，这种说法更是错误的，科学发展远景规划就是科学家在党和政府领导下合作的一个典型范例。配合国民经济发展计划，需要一个科学规划，没有一个科学发展远景规划，要使我国科学接近或赶上国际先进水平是不可能的。我们认为党能领导科学，科学需要党的领导，政治思想、政策、方针、计划等方面更需要党和政府的领导。
    二、关于知识分子的改造问题
    在这次整风运动开始的时候，我们知识分子的政治嗅觉太不敏感了，当歪风起来的时候，许多知识分子虽然觉得不对头，但还看不出这是反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，而立刻起来斗争。我们有些人以自己的“好心肠”去看待右派分子，这种“好心肠”实际上就是政治觉悟低。等到工人农民出来说话了，才看清了右派分子言行的反动性，才投入了战斗，与右派分子划清界限，在战斗中锻炼了自己，提高了自己。我们看到有些知识分子是甘心被右派分子利用而还不觉悟，有些则在不知不觉中被利用了，而有些知识分子有浓厚的资产阶级思想，变为右派散布谬论的市场。
    在这次反右派的斗争中，我们知识分子越来越感觉到，我们人已经进入社会主义，而思想却还没有进入社会主义。我们在过去思想改造中是有进步的，但是学习马克思列宁主义，多停留在书本上，没有很好地与实际结合，很少在实践中锻炼。毛主席及时地向我们知识分子提出了指示说，为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。
    教育青年，传授知识，是我们科学工作者和教育工作者的光荣任务。我们在教育青年传授知识的过程中，也就把我们的作风、习气、看法不可避免地传授给青年了。所以学校教师有培养下一代的灵魂工程师的光荣称号。毛主席指出说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。倘若我们教师们自己不能掌握无产阶级的思想武器，不能够在阶级斗争的风浪中站稳立场，明辨是非，那就没有灵魂；自己没有灵魂，如何有资格来做“灵魂工程师”！目前我们大家要求加强对青年的政治思想教育，一面固然要改进政治教育的教材和方法，以免脱离实际，但是更重要的是教师们努力掌握正确的政治观点，加强自己的劳动观点，逐步地同工农打成一片，提高社会主义觉悟。这样才能使青年学生在潜移默化的教育过程中，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    我们在这次反右派的斗争中，深深体会到知识分子的思想改造，不但非常必要，而且是长期的细致的经常性的工作。我们知识分子只有抓紧思想改造，不断努力，才能完成世界观的转变，才能整齐步伐坚定立场，在党的坚强领导下，在建设社会主义的顽强斗争中，能发挥应有的力量。
