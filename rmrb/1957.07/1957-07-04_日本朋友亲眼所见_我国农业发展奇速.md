    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 2nd. Dr. Matsuura Hajime, head of the Japanese Michurin Society delegation to China, said in Hong Kong today that in the past few years, China has achieved "rapid progress" in developing agriculture. He was deeply impressed by China's system of agricultural collectivization. He believes that China's agricultural progress is due to agricultural collectivization and improved technology.

    Matsuura Hajime is a professor in the Faculty of Science at Hokkaido University in Japan. He said that although China's current level of agricultural development is not yet as high as Japan's, China will catch up with or even surpass Japan's level within two or three years.

    Matsuura Hajime, who led the delegation, arrived in Hong Kong today on his way back to Japan after a visit of more than a month to China. He said that the delegation members had given reports on various agricultural issues in eight cities in China and had also inspected some agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    我国农业发展奇速
    新华社香港2日电　日本米丘林会访华代表团团长松蒲一博士今天在香港说，在过去的几年间，中国在发展农业方面获得“飞速的进步”。他对中国实行农业合作化的制度有深刻的印象。他认为，中国农业的进步是由于农业合作化和改进技术。
    松蒲一是日本北海道大学理学部教授。他说，中国目前的农业发展水平虽然还没有日本高，但是在两三年的时间内，中国将会赶上或者甚至超过日本的水平。
    松蒲一所率领的这个代表团在中国作了一个多月的访问后，今天在回国途中到达香港。他说，代表团团员们曾经在中国八个城市作过各种农业问题的报告，并且考察了一些农业生产合作社。
