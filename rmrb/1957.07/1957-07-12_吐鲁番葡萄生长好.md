Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi – This year, the grapes in Turpan are growing luxuriantly, with large and plentiful bunches of fruit.

In order to strive for an even greater harvest, agricultural cooperatives and farms in the Turpan Basin have generally applied base fertilizer before the grapevines were unearthed in the spring. More supplemental fertilizer was also applied before and after the grape blossoms than in previous years, and management techniques have also been improved.
