    Resolutely Strive to Maintain Peace in Korea

    Today is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. As American imperialism is brazenly undermining the armistice agreement and creating tensions in Korea and even throughout Asia, it is of practical significance to review how the Korean armistice was achieved and the struggle between two lines in the implementation of the armistice agreement over the past four years.

    The realization of the Korean armistice was the result of the complete failure of the American plot to invade Korea and use Korea as a base to invade China. The flames of war ignited by the United States in Korea posed a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. The people of Korea and China, in order to defend their motherlands and world peace, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, drove them back to the place where they launched the aggression, and forced them to sit down and negotiate.

    Of course, American imperialism was not reconciled to this disastrous defeat. During the long armistice negotiations at Panmunjom, the United States bargained at the negotiating table, trying to obtain what it could not obtain through military aggression. On the other hand, it constantly launched offensives on the battlefield, trying to support its position in the negotiations. However, both of these tricks failed. Even on the eve of the signing of the armistice agreement, the United States launched a major offensive in the Kim Sung area along the Korean central front. This offensive was met with a strong counterattack from the Korean and Chinese sides. The positions of four American divisions collapsed completely, with more than 40,000 casualties. The American aggressors were then forced to sign the armistice agreement.

    From this, it can be seen that the Korean Armistice Agreement was obtained by the people of Korea and China at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice in order to safeguard the security of Korea and China and peace in Asia. The people of Korea and China, of course, advocate strict adherence to the various provisions of this agreement and that this agreement be fully implemented. As for the United States, it was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. It has not abandoned its ambitions for aggression. Therefore, it has attempted to undermine the armistice agreement at any time, especially those clauses related to ensuring the stability of the Korean armistice and promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    The completely opposite positions of the Korean and Chinese sides and the American side on the Korean Armistice Agreement have determined the struggle between the two lines in the implementation of the armistice agreement in the four years since the Korean armistice.

    For the past four years, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently strictly abided by the various provisions of the armistice agreement and have made tremendous efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The numerous reports of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as well as the Geneva Conference in 1954 and the many proposals and measures put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea over the past four years, are the best proof. In complete contrast to the attitude of the Korean and Chinese sides, the United States has been trying its best to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement since the time of the armistice. It started with violating the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war, encroaching on the neutral zone and the areas controlled by the Korean and Chinese sides, and then expanded the Syngman Rhee army, smuggling reinforcing weapons and equipment into South Korea, and expelling the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea. Recently, the United States has gone even further, openly unilaterally abolishing Article 13(d) of the armistice agreement, shipping new weapons into South Korea, and attempting to turn South Korea into an American atomic base. While violating and undermining the armistice agreement, the United States has deliberately put forward absurd conditions to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and has strengthened its control over the Syngman Rhee clique.

    Obviously, the purpose of the United States is to undermine the stability of the Korean armistice and create tensions in Korea, in order to cooperate with its conspiracy to prepare for a war of aggression planned in Asia and around the world.

    However, the American aggressors should see that today the forces of the Korean and Chinese people to defend peace are stronger, and that the people of all countries in the world, including the American people, are uniting more and more closely under the banner of defending peace. Since the people of Korea and China and the peace-loving people of the world have the power to force the United States to sign the armistice agreement, they also have the power and determination to defend this fruit of peace. The Korean Armistice Agreement is a guarantee of peace in Korea, and we will never allow the United States to undermine it. The people of Korea and China will resolutely strive to maintain peace in Korea.

### 坚决为维护朝鲜和平而努力

    坚决为维护朝鲜和平而努力
    今天是朝鲜停战协定签订四周年的日子。当美帝国主义正在悍然破坏停战协定，在朝鲜以至整个亚洲制造紧张局势的时候，回顾一下如何实现朝鲜停战，以及停战四年来在实施停战协定方面两条路线的斗争，是具有现实的意义的。
    朝鲜停战的实现，是美国侵略朝鲜、并以朝鲜为基地进犯中国的阴谋彻底失败的结果。美国在朝鲜煽起的战争火焰，造成了对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁。朝中两国人民为了保卫祖国和世界和平，在世界爱好和平人民的支持下，给了侵略者以沉重的打击，把它赶回到发动侵略的地方，并且迫使它不得不坐下来谈判。
    当然，美帝国主义对于这场惨败是并不甘心的。在板门店的漫长的停战谈判过程中，美国一方面在谈判桌上讨价还价，企图取得它用军事侵略不能取得的东西，另一方面在战场上不断发动攻势，企图支持它在谈判中的地位。但是，这两套伎俩都遭到了失败。直到停战协定签订前夕，美国还在朝鲜中线金城地区发动了一次大攻势。这次攻势遭到了朝中方面的坚强反击。美国方面四个师的阵地全线崩溃，损失四万多人。美国侵略者才被迫签订了停战协定。
    由此可见，朝鲜停战协定是朝中两国人民为了保卫朝中两国的安全和亚洲的和平，用流血牺牲的代价得来的。朝中人民当然主张严格遵守这个协定，并且使这个协定彻底付诸实施。而对于美国来说，它是被迫在朝鲜停战协定上签字的。它并没有放弃它的侵略野心。因此，它企图随时破坏停战协定，特别是其中那些有关保证朝鲜停战稳定和促进朝鲜和平统一的条款。
    朝中方面和美国方面对于朝鲜停战协定的这两种完全相反的立场，决定了朝鲜停战四年以来在实施停战协定方面的两条路线的斗争。
    四年以来，朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定的各项条款，并且为朝鲜的和平统一作了巨大的努力。中立国监察委员会的多次报告，以及1954年日内瓦会议和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府四年来所提出的许多建议和措施，便是最好的证明。和朝中方面这种态度完全相反，美国从停战的时候起就竭力破坏停战协定的实施。它从违反关于战俘问题的协议、侵犯中立区和朝中方面控制地区开始，进而扩大李承晚军队，偷运增援性武器装备进入南朝鲜，驱逐在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会的视察小组。最近美国更变本加厉，公然片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，向南朝鲜运入新式武器，企图把南朝鲜变成美国的原子基地。与违反和破坏停战协定同时，美国又故意提出荒谬的条件，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并且加强对李承晚集团的控制。
    很明显，美国的目的是要破坏朝鲜停战的稳定，在朝鲜制造紧张局势，以配合它在亚洲和全世界所策划的准备侵略战争的阴谋。
    但是，美国侵略者应当看到，今天朝中人民保卫和平的力量更加强大了，而且，包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民，在保卫和平的旗帜下日益紧密地团结起来了。朝中人民和世界爱好和平人民既然有力量迫使美国在停战协定上签字，也就有力量有决心保卫这个和平果实。朝鲜停战协定是朝鲜和平的保证，我们决不容许美国破坏。朝中两国人民将坚决地为维护朝鲜和平而努力。
