Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Liang reported: It was learned from the State Planning Commission that from 1953 to date, twenty-nine large-scale newly built and rebuilt machine manufacturing plants have been completed and put into production in our country. There are currently more than forty huge machine manufacturing plants under construction. It is estimated that this year, the total output value of China's machine manufacturing industry will increase three times compared to 1952, the year before the First Five-Year Plan, and twenty-eight times compared to 1949.

Our country's modern machine industry has a history of more than eighty years, starting from the establishment of the Shanghai Arsenal by Li Hongzhang in the first year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, which is 1862 AD, until the liberation in 1949. However, the foundation of the machine industry in old China was very weak. Before liberation, almost all machines in our country were imported from foreign countries. Old China only had repair and parts industries serving foreign machines, and there was no truly independent machine manufacturing industry.

The construction of the First Five-Year Plan changed this situation.

Metallurgical, Mining, and Power Generation Equipment Can Mostly Be Manufactured Domestically

In the field of large-scale equipment such as metallurgy and mining, which was completely blank in the past, our country is now able to manufacture equipment such as blast furnaces with a volume of 1,000 cubic meters, steelmaking furnaces of 150 tons, coal mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons, and coal preparation plants with 1 million tons.

In the thermal power plants of old China, all the power generation equipment was of foreign origin; the equipment of hydropower stations could only produce a few hundred kilowatts. Now, the rapidly developing Chinese electric motor manufacturing plants and power machinery manufacturing plants are manufacturing thermal power generation equipment with a power of 25,000 kilowatts and hydropower generation equipment with a design power of 72,500 kilowatts for newly built power stations.

The Number of Machine Tools Produced After Liberation
Exceeds the Total Number Equipped in Old China

The machine tool and tool manufacturing industry, which is the foundation of the machine manufacturing industry, has also made great progress in the past few years. This year, our country will produce about 200 types of machine tools, many of which are new, precision, automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. In 1952, only more than 40 types of mostly old-fashioned machine tools could be produced. In the few years since liberation, the number of machine tools produced in our country has exceeded the number of machine tools equipped in the entire machine industry of old China. After the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which is under construction, is completed, our country will be able to manufacture giant machine tools needed by the shipbuilding industry, locomotive manufacturing industry, and heavy machinery manufacturing industry.

The machinery needed for people's lives and light industry manufactured by our country itself are of thousands of types. Large ones include paper machines with a daily output of 50 tons, and complete sets of equipment for sugar factories that can process 2,000 tons of sugarcane per day; small ones include watches, sewing machines, typewriters, and other equipment such as movie projectors, many of which can be manufactured in our country.

Automobile and Aircraft Industries Lay the Foundation; Instrument Products Reach Modern Levels

People have long known that our country is already able to manufacture trucks and jet aircraft. The modern First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and other aircraft factories that have been built have laid a preliminary foundation for our country's emerging automobile manufacturing industry and aircraft industry.

The instrument industry is an important link in the development of modern industry and technology. Our country's instrument industry, which has only developed since liberation, is already able to manufacture hundreds of types of instruments and meters for industrial, automotive, and scientific research use. Among them, electronic instruments such as ultrasonic depth sounders and cadmium sulfide photoconductive tubes, various automatic control thermal instruments, vertical optical comparators, various medical and industrial X-ray machines, and various optical instruments are all products with modern levels.

After the Completion of the First Tractor Plant, Domestic Tractors Can Be Supplied in Large Quantities

Our country's machinery industry has manufactured many types of mechanized farming tools such as combine harvesters, seeders, disc harrows, etc. In order to adapt to the situation of agriculture in our country and the needs after agricultural cooperativization, many machinery factories in various places have also produced a large number of animal-powered farm implements. After the Luoyang First Tractor Plant is completed during the Second Five-Year Plan, it will be able to supply domestic tractors in large quantities.

In 1956, the total output value and many major products of our country's machine manufacturing industry have completed or overfulfilled the targets of the First Five-Year Plan.

The Regional Distribution of the Mechanical Industry is Being Rationally Adjusted

The unreasonable regional distribution of the machinery industry has also begun to change. In addition to the original and expanded centers of machine manufacturing such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Dalian, new centers of machine manufacturing such as Harbin, Qiqihar, Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou are gradually growing.

These achievements of our country's machine manufacturing industry are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. Many large-scale machine manufacturing plants built during the First Five-Year Plan have received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries from surveying, design, and construction to putting them into production.

### 机械工业发展壮大  二十九个规模巨大的机器制造厂投入生产  今年总产值将比1949年增长二十八倍

    机械工业发展壮大
    二十九个规模巨大的机器制造厂投入生产
    今年总产值将比1949年增长二十八倍
    据新华社30日讯　新华社记者王良报道：从国家计划委员会获悉，1953年到目前为止，我国已经有二十九个规模巨大的新建和改建的机器制造厂建成并投入生产。目前正在施工的巨大的机器制造厂还有四十多个。预计，今年中国机器制造工业的总产值将比第一个五年计划的前一年——1952年增长三倍，比1949年增长二十八倍。
    我国从清朝同治元年即公元1862年李鸿章在上海创办制炮局开始，一直到1949年解放时止，近代机器工业已有八十多年的历史。但是旧中国机器工业的基础是十分薄弱的。解放前，我国几乎所有的机器都是从外国进口的。旧中国只有为外国机器服务的修配工业，没有真正独立的机器制造工业。
    第一个五年计划的建设，改变了这种情况。
    冶金、采矿、发电设备许多都能自己制造
    在过去完全是空白的冶金和采矿等大型设备方面，我国现在已经能够制造容积一千立方公尺的炼铁炉，一百五十吨的炼钢炉，年产六十万吨煤的矿井和一百万吨的选煤厂等设备。
    旧中国的火力电站里，完全装置外国的发电设备；水力电站的设备，也只能生产到几百瓩的。现在飞跃发展的中国电机制造工厂和动力机器制造工厂，正在为新建的电站制造功率为二万五千瓩的火力发电设备和设计功率为七万二千五百瓩的水力发电设备。
      解放后生产的机床
  超过旧中国装备的总数
    作为机器制造业基础的机床和工具制造工业，在过去几年中也有了很大的发展。今年我国生产的各式机床将达到二百种左右，这些机床有许多都是新型的精密度很高的自动和半自动机床。而1952年只能生产四十多种多数是老式的机床。解放几年来，我国生产的机床已经超过旧中国整个机器工业所装备的机床的数量。正在加紧建设的武汉重型机床厂建成后，我国就可以制造造船业、机车制造业和重型机器制造业所需要的巨型机床。
    我国自己制造的人民生活和轻工业所需要的机械，种类成千上万。大的如日产五十吨的造纸机、每日可以处理二千吨甘蔗的制糖厂的全套设备，小的如钟表、缝纫机、打字机以及其他像电影放映机等许多设备，我国都可以制造。
    汽车、飞机工业奠定基础仪表产品达到现代水平
    人们早已知道我国已经能够制造载重汽车和喷气式飞机。已经建成的现代化的第一汽车制造厂和其他的飞机工厂，为我国新兴的汽车制造业和飞机工业奠定了初步的基础。
    仪表工业是现代工业和技术发展的重要环节。解放后才发展起来的我国仪表工业已经能够制造好几百种包括工业、汽车和科学研究等使用的各种仪表和仪器。其中像超声波测深仪、硫化镉光导管等电子仪器，各种自动控制的热工仪表，立式光学比较仪，各种医药和工业用X光机以及各种光学仪器等等，都是具有近代化水平的产品。
    第一拖拉机厂建成后可大批供应国产拖拉机
    我国机械工业已经制造了许多型式的机耕农具如联合收割机、播种机、圆盘耙等等。为了适应我国农业的情况和农业合作化以后的需要，各地的许多机械工厂还生产了大量的畜力农具。洛阳第一拖拉机厂在第二个五年计划期间建成以后，就可以大批供应国产的拖拉机。
    1956年，我国机器制造业的总产值和许多主要产品，已经完成或者超额完成了第一个五年计划的指标。
    机械工业的地区分布正在合理调整中
    机械工业地区分布不合理的情况，也开始有了转变。除了原有的并且是扩大了的机器制造业的中心如上海、天津、沈阳和大连等地方外，新的机器制造业的中心如哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、洛阳、西安和兰州，正在逐步地成长。
    我国机器制造工业的这些成就，是同苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私帮助分不开的。第一个五年计划中兴建的许多规模巨大的机器制造工厂，从勘测、设计、施工到投入生产，都获得苏联等兄弟国家的无私帮助。
