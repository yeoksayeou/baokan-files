Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 5th: According to a report in today's "People's Daily" in Jakarta, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party began on July 4th in Jakarta. "People's Daily" stated that this plenary session will summarize the experience of the past ten months and formulate a political line that conforms to the new situation.

At the meeting on the 4th, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, on behalf of the Central Political Bureau, delivered a general report entitled "Change the Balance of Forces, Realize President Sukarno's Plan 100%." Aidit's report was divided into four parts: the political situation, the Sukarno Plan, mass work, and the first three-year plan for organization and education work.

When analyzing the international and domestic situation, Aidit pointed out that the characteristic of the period since the Fourth Plenary Session in August last year is the development of the democratic movement, the strengthening of the unity of progressive forces, and the increasing isolation of reactionary elements.

Aidit pointed out that the widespread support of the people and state organs for President Sukarno's plan is a victory for progressive forces. At the same time, he called on the entire party to maintain vigilance against reactionary forces at home and abroad.

Aidit reminded the current cabinet to pay attention to solving financial and economic problems, and to pay special attention to abolishing the Round Table Conference Agreement.

Aidit finally called for strengthening party unity, saying that party unity is an effective weapon for changing the balance of forces and an indispensable condition for realizing the Sukarno Plan.

Because Aidit went to Bandung to attend the 30th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, his report was read by another member of the Central Political Bureau.

At the meeting on the 4th, four Central Committee members and alternate members spoke on the general report, and four Central Political Bureau members made supplementary speeches on the general report: Lukman's speech on local parliamentary elections; Yudo's speech on the education and work of intellectuals; Sutisman's speech on the education of women; and Sakirman's speech on the work of the Constitutional Assembly.

At the meeting on the 5th, other Central Committee members will continue to speak on the general report. The meeting will close on the 6th.

    新华社雅加达5日电　据雅加达“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第五届全体会议7月4日在雅加达开始举行。“人民日报”说，这次全会将总结最近十个月来的经验，并且规定符合新情况的政治路线。
    在4日的会议上，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地代表中央政治局作了题为“改变力量对比，百分之百地实现苏加诺总统方案”的总报告。艾地的报告分为四个部分：政治局势、苏加诺方案、群众工作、关于组织和教育工作的第一个三年计划。
    艾地在分析国际国内形势的时候指出，去年8月的四中全会以来这段时期的特点是民主运动的发展，进步力量的团结的增强和反动分子的日益孤立。
    艾地指出，人民群众和国家机构广泛支持苏加诺总统方案，这是进步力量的胜利。他同时号召全党对国内外反动势力保持警惕。
    艾地提醒现内阁注意解决财政经济问题，并且特别注意废除圆桌会议协定。
    艾地最后号召加强党内团结，他说，党内团结是改变力量对比的有效武器和实现苏加诺方案的必不可缺的条件。
    由于艾地去万隆出席印度尼西亚国民党成立三十周年纪念会，他的报告由另一位中央政治局委员代读。
    在4日的会议中，有四位中央委员和候补委员就总报告作了发言，此外还有四位中央政治局委员对总报告作了补充性的发言，即：鲁克曼关于地方议会选举的发言；约多关于知识分子的教育和工作的发言；苏蒂斯曼关于妇女群众的教育的发言和萨基尔曼关于制宪议会工作的发言。
