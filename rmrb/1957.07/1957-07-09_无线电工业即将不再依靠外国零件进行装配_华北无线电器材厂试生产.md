Xinhua News Agency, July 7th – The factory buildings of China's first modern comprehensive radio equipment manufacturing plant, the North China Radio Equipment Factory, have been completed in Beijing. Most of the equipment has also been installed and is undergoing trial production, scheduled to go into operation in October this year.

This factory is one of the basic enterprises of China's radio industry, manufacturing general components used in radio applications, excluding electron tubes. In the past, most of these components relied on imports. Once this factory is put into production, together with the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, which has already started production, it will fundamentally change the situation in which China's radio industry relies on foreign parts for domestic assembly. The factory's main products include selenium rectifiers, various measuring meters, various paper-dielectric capacitors and carbon film resistors that can withstand the highest temperatures, humidity, and vibration, various ceramic-dielectric capacitors with small size, large capacity, and stable performance, and various ferrite materials used in televisions and electronic computers, etc. The output of this factory's products will basically meet the current needs of the domestic market, and some products can also be exported.

This factory is a combined factory, with its own thermal power station and gas station in addition to several production plants. The factory's equipment is modern, the process is advanced, and it has many automated and semi-automated machines. The factory's industrial hygiene requirements are very high. Some production workshops do not even open windows to ensure clean air in the workshop, and air conditioning equipment is used to control the indoor temperature and humidity.

This factory is being built with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic. Most of the factory's machinery and equipment are manufactured by factories in the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic has also sent excellent experts to the factory for technical guidance.

    无线电工业即将不再依靠外国零件进行装配
    华北无线电器材厂试生产
    新华社7日讯　我国第一座现代化综合性的制造无线电器材的工厂——华北无线电器材厂的厂房已经在北京建成，绝大部分设备也已经安装好，正进行试生产，预定在今年10月投入生产。
    这个厂是我国无线电工业基础企业之一，制造除电子管以外的无线电方面应用的一般原件。这些原件在过去绝大部分依靠国外进口。这个厂投入生产以后，将同已经投入生产的北京电子管厂一起，基本上改变我国无线电工业依靠外国零件由国内装配的状况。这个厂的主要产品，有硒整流器，各种测量电表，能耐最高温湿度和震动的各种纸介电容器、炭膜电阻，体积小容量大、性能稳定的各种瓷介电容器，电视机和电子计算机上用的各种铁淦氧材料等等。这个工厂产品的产量将基本上满足目前国内市场的需要，有些产品还可以出口。
    这个厂是一个联合工厂，除几个生产分厂以外，还有自己的热电站、煤气站。这个厂设备是现代化的，工艺过程先进，拥有许多自动化、半自动化的机器。工厂的工业卫生要求很高，有的生产车间的窗户都不打开，保证车间空气清洁，并用空气调节设备控制室内温湿度。
    这个厂是由德意志民主共和国帮助我国建设的。这个厂绝大部分的机器设备是由民主德国工厂制造的。德意志民主共和国还派遣优秀的专家来厂进行技术指导。
