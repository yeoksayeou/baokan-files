    The Person Who Wore Broken Shoes
    Wang Jian
    I used to wear broken shoes.
    Twenty-four years ago, when I was in elementary school, my mother patched the holes in my black cloth shoes with two blue cloth patches. The children of wealthy people at the next table would shout and yell, calling everyone to come and see the "flowered shoes" I was wearing. I was so ashamed that I hid my feet under the table, afraid to move.
    Seventeen years ago, during the Hundred Regiments Offensive, I had already joined the revolutionary work and was responsible for mobilizing stretcher bearers to transport the wounded. After three months of hard fighting, my shoes were so broken that they were beyond recognition. When I was about to set off again with the militiamen's stretcher team in Xiazhuang, Liaoxian County, the village office's communications officer, Cripple Lao Xie, stopped me again. "Stop nagging, you want to carry a stretcher? Someone will have to carry you!" This was the third time I had refused him. He didn't say anything, just took off the shallow-mouthed shoes he was wearing and placed them next to my bare feet. His sad nose dripped water all over his white mustache, and my heart ached, but I put on those shallow-mouthed shoes. I do remember that those shoes were also broken.
    In the winter of 1950, when I was being carried to the hospital on a stretcher in Sachang-ri, Korea, I discovered that the communications squad leader had crawled out of the fortifications onto the snow barefoot to see me off. I asked the stretcher bearers to take off my shoes and ordered the communications squad leader to put them on. These shoes were also torn by the enemy's barbed wire, but they were still wearable. (This time it wasn't that we were issued too few, but that the main luggage hadn't caught up with the pursuing troops.)
    After I was demobilized, I now have leather shoes, cloth shoes, and even perforated ones. Only one of my leather shoes has a small round patch, which doesn't detract much. Sir, do you think I am still considered "someone who used to wear broken shoes"?
    In Ge Peiqi's view, only those who wore woolen clothes in the past will be able to wear woolen clothes in the future; those who wore broken shoes in the past will only ever wear broken shoes. Like an owl longing for darkness, Ge Peiqi hopes for an era when most people wear broken shoes.

    穿过破鞋的人
    王俭
    我过去是穿破鞋的。
    二十四年前，读小学时，娘把我的黑布鞋的破洞上加补了两块蓝布补钉，邻桌有钱人的孩子，就大叫大嚷，叫别的人都来看我穿的“花鞋”，我羞得把脚伸在桌底下，说啥也不敢走动。
    十七年前百团大战时，我早参加了革命工作，当时担任动员担架运送伤员，三个月的苦战，我的鞋破的连影子都没了；当我在辽县下庄带着民兵担架队又出发的时候，村公所通讯员拐子老谢又拖住了我，“你别再啰嗦，你去抬担架？还要人抬你呢？”这是我第三次拒绝他去，他没说什么，只是脱下了他脚上的那双浅口鞋，放在我赤着的两只脚边，他伤心的鼻子水直流到花白的口髭上，我心里也直发酸，但我穿上了那双浅口鞋，我确记得，那双鞋也是破了的。
    1950年冬在朝鲜社仓里我坐上担架送医院时，发觉通讯班长赤着脚从工事里爬到雪地上来送我，我请担架员脱下我的鞋并命令通讯班长穿上，这双鞋也被敌人乱铁丝网扯破了两道口子，不过还可穿。（这次不是发的少，而是大行李未跟上追击部队）
    我转业后，现在有皮鞋、有布鞋，还有透孔的，只有一只皮鞋上补了一个很小的圆补钉，不碍大雅，先生，你看我现在还算不算“过去穿破鞋的”。
    在葛佩琦看来，大约只有过去穿上呢子服的，今后也才能穿呢子服；过去穿破鞋的人，今后也只有永远穿破鞋的份儿。夜猫子盼天黑，葛佩琦盼的就是使大多数人穿破鞋的年代。
