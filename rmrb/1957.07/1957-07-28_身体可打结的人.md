    Person Who Can Tie Their Body in Knots
    In France, there is a folk artist named Percy Creape, whose body seems to have no bones. He can fold himself like a pocketknife or tie himself into a knot like a ribbon. Creape began learning his craft at the age of six and has been doing it for thirty-two years. Wherever he goes, people are attracted by his extraordinary skills.
