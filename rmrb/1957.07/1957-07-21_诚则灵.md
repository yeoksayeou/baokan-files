Few people oppose collaboration, at least few oppose it publicly; however, when collaboration is mentioned, after expressing agreement, many shake their heads repeatedly, indicating that it is difficult to implement. Taking the collaboration between enterprises in construction as an example, the People's Daily has published editorials criticizing some enterprises for being unwilling to share auxiliary workshops and laboratories that could be shared, demanding the rejection of the "self-reliance in everything" "go-it-alone" mentality. It has also published articles reporting on the waste caused by each of the enterprises in Lanzhou building its own repair workshop. Yesterday, it reported on the lessons learned by some factories in Xi'an from not paying attention to collaboration. Comrades in many industrial departments say that the raising of this issue is "very important and timely," but when it comes to how to organize collaboration in future construction, they look embarrassed, feeling that things are not simple and may not work.

This is a bit puzzling. "Things are not simple" is indeed the truth. Taking the centralized use of repair workshops as an example, which types of work can be centralized, which types of work cannot be centralized, and how to centralize them all require further study. However, since it is generally recognized that "going it alone" is wasteful and organizing collaboration saves money, even though specific work still needs to be studied, why is it that people always shake their heads repeatedly, feeling that it is "difficult to implement" and doubting that it "may not work"?

This puzzling question has finally been solved. A comrade from the Fifth Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building Design Bureau reported an incident: when they were doing the overall design for two new factories under the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industry, they planned to merge the canteens and boiler rooms of the two factories into one design. The two factories are adjacent to each other and are not large in scale, so it should not be a problem to share a canteen and boiler room. However, the factory opposed it, and the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industry also opposed it, on the grounds that "the wage standards of the two factories may be different." This is truly unwillingness to collaborate finding any excuse! How can different wage standards affect sharing a canteen and boiler room?

Canteens and boiler rooms are different from repair workshops. One is a non-production building, and the other is a production building. If the shared use of production buildings such as repair workshops is indeed "not simple" and there are still some specific issues to be studied, then the centralized use of non-production buildings such as canteens and boiler rooms is the simplest thing. Even such a simple collaboration cannot be implemented, and it is so difficult to handle, which shows that the reason why collaboration is "difficult to implement" and "may not work" does not lie in the simplicity or complexity of the matter itself, but in whether there is sincerity.

Worshipping Buddha, "sincerity brings efficacy," is deceptive. In the matter of collaboration, it is truly "sincerity brings efficacy." If there is sincerity, even the most complicated collaboration problems can be implemented; if there is no sincerity, even the simplest collaboration problems like canteens and boiler rooms are difficult to handle.

The specific problems in collaboration must be carefully studied, and simplified methods should not be adopted. However, the most important thing is to have sincerity. The sincerity of collaboration is the overall concept and the national concept. Without destruction, there can be no construction; to establish the overall concept and the national concept, we must first break down departmentalism and local perspectives.

    诚则灵
    吴滤
    反对协作的人不多，至少公开反对的人不多；但是谈起协作，赞同之余，连连摇头，表示难办的，却常常可以见到。拿建设中组织企业之间的协作来说，人民日报发表过社论，批判过有些企业不愿意同别的企业共同使用完全可以共同使用的辅助车间和实验室，要求“万事不求人”的“单干”思想；也发表过文章，报道了兰州的一些企业各建一个修理车间造成浪费的情况；昨天，又报道了西安的一些工厂没有注意协作所得的教训。这个问题的提出，许多工业部门的同志都说是“很重要，很及时”的，然而，具体到今后的建设中怎样组织协作，却又面有难色，觉得事情并不简单，未必行得通了。
    这就有点令人难解了。“事情并不简单”，倒是实情。拿集中使用修理车间来说，哪些工种的活可以集中，哪些工种的活不能集中，以及怎样集中，都还需要研究。可是，既然“单干”浪费，组织协作节省资金是大家公认了的，尽管具体工作还有待于研究，又何至于总是连连摇头，觉得“难办”，怀疑“未必行得通”呢？
    这难解的问题也终于解开了。第一机械工业部设计总局第五设计分局一位同志反映了一件事情：他们给天津市机电局所属的两个新建工厂作总体设计时，准备把这两个厂的食堂和锅炉房合并设计。这两个厂紧相毗邻，规模都不大，合用一个食堂和锅炉房，照理是不成问题的。然而，厂方反对，天津市机电局也反对，理由是“两个厂的工资标准可能不一样”。这真是不愿协作，何患无辞！工资标准不一样，怎么会影响到共用一个食堂和锅炉房呢？
    食堂和锅炉房同修理车间不一样。一个是非生产性建筑，一个是生产性建筑，如果说修理车间等生产性建筑的共同使用，确实“事情并不简单”，还有一些具体问题尚待研究的话，那么，食堂和锅炉房等非生产性建筑的集中使用，是再简单不过的事情了。连这样最简单的协作都行不通，都这么难办，可见协作之所以“难办”，“未必行得通”，问题并不在于事情本身的简单和不简单，而在于有没有诚意。
    拜菩萨，“诚则灵”，那是骗人的。在协作问题上，倒是真正“诚则灵”的。若有诚意，多么不简单的协作问题也可以行得通；若无诚意，连食堂和锅炉房这种最简单的协作问题也很难办。
    协作中的具体问题是要认真研究的，不可采取简单化的方法。但是，最重要的，还是要有诚意。协作的诚意，就是整体观念，国家观念。不破不立，立整体观念，国家观念，非先破本位主义、局部观点不可。
