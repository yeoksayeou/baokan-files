Nie Guoqing's speech said: I am a man nearing eighty years old. In April and May of this year, I went to Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, to inspect work. I visited several counties and went to many agricultural cooperatives for in-depth investigations. I heard a lot and saw a lot, and I deeply felt the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in the countryside in the past year. The improvement of farmers' lives did not fall from the sky; the grassroots cadres of the Party have done a great deal of meticulous and hard work in helping the people improve their living standards and have established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. The lies of the rightists can only prove that they themselves are complacent ambitious individuals.

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports of the congress.

In 1956, China basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in terms of means of production, and the countryside is undergoing a profound transformation from poverty to prosperity.

In April and May of this year, I went to Xiangyang Prefecture in northwestern Hubei Province to inspect work, focusing on understanding the changes in farmers' lives after agricultural cooperation. During this period, I visited several counties including Sui County, Zaoyang, Xiangyang, Guanghua, and Gucheng, listened to reports from local party and government leaders, and also went to many agricultural cooperatives for in-depth investigations. I heard a lot and saw a lot, and I deeply felt the earth-shaking changes that have indeed taken place in the countryside in the past year, making me feel as if I had fallen behind by several years. I saw that under the encouragement of agricultural cooperation, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers was unprecedentedly high. The implementation of various measures to increase production, such as building farmland water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, improving farm tools, and seeds, resulted in an unprecedented bumper harvest in the first year of agricultural cooperation, and farmers' lives were correspondingly improved, and the face of the countryside has been completely renewed. By the time my inspection was nearing its end, the wheat had already been harvested. What made me particularly happy was that this year's wheat broke the unprecedented record again, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest in five counties, with an average yield of more than 300 catties per mu. Agricultural bumper harvests and the improvement of farmers' lives did not fall from the sky, but were achieved through our hard work. From the places I have visited, the local party and government leaders and all rural cadres, in addition to going all out to lead farmers in carrying out large-scale agricultural production campaigns, they also paid special attention to the arrangement of production and life for households in difficulty in the leadership of agricultural production from top to bottom, and have achieved great results. The multifaceted and active assistance provided by the Shouyi Cooperative branch of Liangshui Township, Sui County, to arrange production and life for households in difficulty is just one example of the countless meticulous work done in this regard that I have seen. From the ordinary activities of this ordinary grassroots organization of the Chinese Communist Party in the countryside, we can see how absurd and shameless the rightists' attacks on our beloved Party and socialist cause are.

I would like to give the representatives a brief report on the changes in the lives of the members of the Shouyi Cooperative in Liangshui Township after agricultural cooperation and how they helped households in difficulty to arrange production and life.

The Shouyi Cooperative was upgraded from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955. Due to the advantages of the collective economic organization, like all other agricultural cooperatives, it achieved a bumper harvest in the first year of cooperation. The average yield of wheat per mu was 208 catties, an increase of 85% over the previous year; the yield of indica rice converted to japonica rice increased from 421 catties per mu to 502 catties, an increase of 19%; the yield of ginned cotton per mu was 59 catties, an increase of 156% over the previous year. During the distribution last year, 98% of the 284 households in the cooperative increased their income. The average income per person in 1955 was 48 yuan, which increased to 67 yuan last year, an increase of 40%.

Although the cooperative increased production and most members increased their income and their lives improved, there were still 37 members in the cooperative living a life of "barely enough" (enough to eat, enough to wear, enough to use) (this does not include the families of revolutionary martyrs and the "five guarantees" households, whose lives had already been well arranged by the cooperative according to government regulations). Among them, 16 households had greater difficulties, with an average income of only 40 yuan in 1956, which was nearly half the living standard of upper-middle peasants. According to the survey, there are three reasons for the difficulties: first, long-term sores and diseases; second, thin family resources and excessive debts; and third, large families with many mouths and few laborers. The cumulative debt is 1,460 yuan, and several households owe more than 100 yuan. The main problems at present are the lack of clothing and small farm tools. Yang Zhengqi, a poor peasant, has only one quilt for his five family members and shares clothes with his wife for washing. Six households lack hoes and shovels, which affects attendance and reduces work points. Although the lives of households in difficulty have also changed to varying degrees after cooperation, their long-term poverty cannot be changed overnight. Cai Huaqi, a large family with seven members and five children, only has himself and his wife as laborers. Their income is low, their burden is heavy, and their enthusiasm for production is not high. Some say, "It is good to have laborers, and those without laborers have the 'five guarantees,' but it is not good to have few laborers and many people." Some even completely lost confidence in production, did not work hard, and asked the cooperative for money, saying, "Anyway, the cooperative will not starve people to death," etc. Obviously, if this problem is not solved, it will inevitably affect the consolidation of the cooperative and the development of production. The party branch of this cooperative attached great importance to this issue. Since last winter, the branch has often held meetings to study their problems and adopted the method of providing loans from the credit cooperative for those with small difficulties and subsidizing them from the cooperative's public welfare fund for those with greater difficulties. The cooperative provided a total of 312 yuan in loans and 210 yuan in public welfare subsidies, and made 77 cotton-padded clothes for those who lacked clothes. After a period of efforts, the tense situation of arranging for households in difficulty has eased somewhat, but the branch still believes that this is only a temporary measure to treat the symptoms rather than the root cause. To solve the problems of households in difficulty, it is necessary to carry out long-term arrangements and take concrete measures to fundamentally solve them. After several studies by the branch, the understanding was unified, and household visits were conducted in sections to understand the different ideological situations and causes of difficulties of each household. Then, a comprehensive plan and concrete measures were formulated to help households in difficulty change from poverty to prosperity. Their methods are:

First, arrange work according to individual circumstances and make labor plans. According to their characteristics of having many semi-laborers, auxiliary laborers, and weak laborers, 15 households with experience in feeding cattle were arranged to feed cattle. Each cow can provide 120 working days a year, which can offset the income of more than half a laborer. A carpenter was arranged to specialize in carpentry work within the cooperative.

Second, provide assistance in household sideline occupations, mainly raising pigs. The method of raising ordinary pigs for general households in difficulty and raising sows for households with greater difficulties was adopted. The funds are provided by the cooperative, and the plan is to reach one or two pigs per person by the end of this year. Each household should raise ten chickens.

Third, under the principle of not excessively increasing the burden on members and with the consent of the members, appropriate subsidies are provided from the public welfare fund. Deng Congliang's family of four has two children. He has been ill for more than a year, and only his wife is working. The cooperative decided to subsidize him 100 yuan per year from the public welfare fund until his illness is cured. For the four households that currently lack farm tools and clothing, 12 cotton-padded clothes were made and 8 farm tools were purchased for them from the public welfare fund, and the difficulties were basically resolved.

These methods were all proposed by the branch after careful consideration and approved by the members' congress before being implemented as resolutions. According to this plan, of the 16 households with greater difficulties in this cooperative, 8 households can reach the living standard of upper-middle peasants this year, and 8 households can reach the general living standard. By 1958, 15 households can reach the living standard of upper-middle peasants, and only one household will remain at the general living standard.

The practice of agricultural cooperation in the past year has proved that the phenomenon of polarization between the rich and the poor in rural areas has gone forever, and farmers have truly embarked on the road to common prosperity. In 1956, before the transition to advanced cooperatives, only 14.5% of the households in this cooperative lived a life of "more than enough," that is, at the upper-middle peasant living standard. Last year, it had already risen to 62%. The proportion of those with "just enough" was 40.8% in 1955 and 25% last year. The proportion of those with "not enough" was 44.7% in 1955, which dropped to 13% last year. I fully believe that with another one or two years of effort, the impoverished face of this cooperative can be basically changed.

Vivid facts have educated every farmer, and their determination to take the socialist road has become more firm, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. In the past, three middle-peasant households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, but now they say, "I will not withdraw even if I die." Xu Mingzhi, a middle peasant who works individually, said, "If the cooperative doesn't accept me, I will赖 also赖 to the cooperative."

This is the situation of this cooperative. I would like to reiterate that this is just one of the countless examples I have seen. When I went to other counties, they also paid very systematic and specific attention to the leadership of this work. The county magistrate of Gucheng County told me, "I am treating this matter as an important political task to complete." Cai Yitian, a national people's congress representative, special-class agricultural labor model, director of the New Life Cooperative of Gucheng County, and a communist party member, had a list of households in difficulty posted in his house, with the specific arrangement plan for each household and the party branch's division of responsibilities for each household. Comrade Cai Yitian checks the implementation status once a month. Their actions, like those of the vast number of rural cadres and communist party members, embody their noble qualities of caring about the suffering of the masses, and therefore they are also sincerely loved by the people.

Recently, since the development of the party's rectification movement, China's political life has appeared particularly active. Out of the desire to care for the party and the socialist cause, the people have sincerely put forward many criticisms and constructive opinions to the party, which will undoubtedly play a beneficial role in helping the party overcome and prevent shortcomings and mistakes in its progress, and in the country's socialist construction cause. However, the rightists used double-dealing tactics, under the guise of helping the party to rectify, and launched a frenzied attack on the party's leadership and the socialist cause. They clamored, "The shortcomings of the work in the past eight years are the main ones," "pitch black," "the people's lives have declined," "everything has been messed up," and they want to engage in "political design institutes" and "rehabilitation committees," oppose "the party's world," and eliminate the "root cause" of the "three evils" - the dictatorship of the proletariat, etc. These complacent ambitious individuals attempted to turn the gentle breeze and drizzle of the rectification movement into a wild storm that would overthrow the party's leadership and ruin the socialist cause.

The reactionary remarks of the rightists cannot stand up to scrutiny. The practice of life in the past few years has been an extremely profound education for every Chinese person. The situation I reported to the representatives above shows that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese countryside has overthrown the landlords, bullies, and other reactionary forces riding on the heads of the people, realized agricultural cooperation in a very short period of time, developed production, improved the people's lives, and the households in difficulty will disappear in a few years. Are these called "terrible"? The vast number of cadres and millions of communist party members share weal and woe with the people and have established a flesh-and-blood relationship, such as Comrade Cai Yitian posting the list of households in difficulty in his house. Is this called "communist party members are separated from the masses of the people" and "do all kinds of evil"? I am a man nearing eighty years old. I not only support the leadership of the Communist Party and support socialism with my own knowledge and experience, but also feel infinitely honored and proud as a Chinese. Eight years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese people overthrew the oppression of imperialism against us, overthrew the reactionary rule that rode on the heads of the people and acted arbitrarily, and the people themselves truly became the masters of the country for the first time in history. In the past few years, we have also experienced earth-shaking changes. We have done work that the old China could not complete in decades or hundreds of years, and we are also doing an extremely glorious and great cause that no one has ever done before. Our people are rapidly changing the face of the country with their own labor. Could these achievements have been achieved without the leadership of the Communist Party? The Communist Party, which is loved by the people, will never be blown down by a gust of evil wind.

The rightists still have their market. We cannot be tolerant of all kinds of rightists. Any tolerance towards them, allowing those reactionary remarks to go unrefuted, is irresponsible to the people's cause. We must stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and draw a clear line under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, expose the ugly faces of the rightists to the people, and defend our revolutionary achievements and our socialist cause.

### 我所见的共产党的一个普通农村支部

    我所见的共产党的一个普通农村支部
    聂国青的发言说：　我是个年近八十岁的人，今年四五月间去湖北省的襄阳专区视察工作，走了若干个县，也到了不少农业社作了深入考察。我听了很多，看的也很多，深刻感到一年来农村确实发生了惊天动地的变化。农民生活的改善不是天上掉下来的；党的基层干部在帮助人民提高生活水平上细致地辛勤地做了许多工作，同群众建立了血肉相连的关系。右派分子的谎言，只能证明他们自己是得意忘形的野心家。
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。
    一九五六年我国对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业在生产资料方面的社会主义改造基本完成，农村正处在由贫困变富裕的深刻转化中。
    今年四、五月间，我去湖北省西北部的襄阳专区视察工作，着重了解了农业合作化后农民生活的变化情况。在这期间我到过随县、枣阳、襄阳、光化、谷城等若干个县，听了地方党政领导同志的汇报，并且也到了不少的农业社作了深入考察，我听了很多，看的也很多，我深刻感到一年来农村里确实发生了惊天动地的变化，使我大有落后了几年之感。我看到在农业合作化的鼓舞下，广大农民生产积极性空前高涨，兴修农田水利、积肥造肥、改良农具、种子等各项增产措施的实施，在农业合作化的第一年就获得了空前的丰收，农民生活也得到相应的改善，农村面貌已焕然一新。在我视察快结束的时候，小麦已经收割完毕。使我特别感到高兴的是，今年小麦又打破了前所未有的记录，取得了五个县的大面积丰收，每亩平均产量都达到三百多斤以上。农业丰收，农民生活的改善不是天上掉下来的，而是靠我们的辛勤努力取得的。从我所到过的这些地方，当地党政领导和全体农村干部，他们除了正在全力以赴的领导农民开展规模宏大的农业生产运动外，他们自上而下在农业生产的领导上，还特别注意了对困难户的生产和生活的安排工作，并且已经取得了很大的成绩。中共随县两水乡首义社分支部多方面的积极帮助困难户安排生产和生活，就是我所看到的在这方面所做的无数细致工作中的一例。从这个普通的中国共产党农村的基层组织的平凡活动中，我们可以看到右派分子对我们可爱的党和社会主义事业的攻击是何等的荒谬和无耻。
    两水乡首义社在农业合作化后社员的生活变化情况和他们是怎样帮助困难户安排生产和生活的，我想向代表们作个简要汇报。
    首义社是一九五五年冬由初级社升为高级社的，由于发挥了集体经济组织的优越性，和其他所有的农业社一样，合作化的头一年就获得了丰收，小麦平均亩产二百零八斤，比前一年增产百分之八十五；籼稻改粳稻由亩产四百二十一斤提高到五百零二斤，增产百分之十九；亩产皮棉五十九斤，比前一年增产百分之一百五十六。去年分配时，全社二百八十四户有百分之九十八的户增加了收入，一九五五年每人平均收入四十八元，增加到去年的六十七元，增长百分之四十。
    合作社虽然增了产，大部分社员增加收入，生活有了改善，但是社内仍有三十七户社员过着三够（够吃、够穿、够用）不足的生活（这里不包括烈军属和五保户，他们的生活根据政府的规定，合作社早就已经做了很好的安排），其中困难较大的是十六户，一九五六年的平均收入只四十元，比上中农生活水平低近一倍。据调查，困难原因有三：一是长期生疮害病的，二是原来家底薄，积债过多的，三是家大口阔人多劳动力少的。累计欠债一千四百六十元，其中有若干户欠债都在一百元以上，目前的主要问题是缺衣穿和缺少小农具，贫农杨正启五口人只有一床被子，与妻子共衣换洗，有六户没有挖锄、锹影响出勤，少做了工分。困难户的生活合作化后，虽然也有不同程度的改变，但是他们长期的贫困生活确不是一时可以改变过来的，家大口阔户蔡华启七口人五个小孩，只有自己和妻子两个劳动力，收入少、负担重，生产情绪不高，有的说：“有劳力的好，无劳力的有五保，就是劳动力少人口多的不好搞。”有的甚至生产完全失去信心，不好好劳动，没有钱找社里支款，并说：“反正合作社不会饿死人”等等，显然这个问题，不得到解决就必然影响到合作社的巩固，影响到生产的发展。这个社的党支部对此引起了充分的重视，从去年冬天起支部就经常开会研究他们的问题，并采取困难小的由信用社贷款，困难大的从社的公益金中补助的办法，全社共贷款三百一十二元，公益金补助二百一十元，做了七十七件棉衣给少衣服的穿。经过一段的努力，安排困难户的紧张情况缓和了一些，但支部仍然认为这只是头痛医头、脚痛医脚的临时办法，要解决困难户的问题，必须进行长期安置，采取具体措施根本解决。经过支部多次研究后，统一了认识，分片进行挨户访问，摸清每户不同的思想情况和困难原因，然后订出帮助困难户由贫困变富裕的全面规划和具体措施。他们的办法是：
    第一，因人制宜进行活路安排，作出劳动规划，根据他们半劳动力、辅助劳动力多和劳动力弱的特点，把喂牛有经验的十五户安置喂牛，每头牛一年一百二十个劳动日可以抵大半个劳动力的收入，一户木匠安排专做社内木活。
    第二，从家庭副业上进行扶助，主要是养猪，采取一般困难户喂糙猪，困难较大户喂母猪的办法，资金由社内解决，计划今年底达到一人一头，或一人二头。喂鸡每户达到十只。
    第三，在不过分加重社员负担，经过社员同意的原则下，从公益金中适当给予补助，邓从亮四口人两个小孩，本人生病一年多只妻子一人劳动，社里决定他的病未好前，每年从公益金中补助他一百元。对目前缺少农具、衣服的四户从公益金中支出做了十二件棉衣、买了农具八件给他们，困难都基本得到解决。
    这些办法都是支部慎重提出，经过社员大会讨论通过后作为决议执行的。根据这个规划，这个社十六户较大的困难户，今年有八户可以达到上中农的生活水平，八户可以达到一般的生活水平，到一九五八年有十五户可以达到上中农的生活水平，只一户仍维持在一般的生活水平上。
    一年来农业合作化的实践证明，农村中的贫富两极分化现象已经一去不复返了，农民真正走上了共同富裕的道路。一九五六年在转高级社以前，这个社过着三够有余即上中农生活水平的只占百分之十四点五，去年就已经上升到百分之六十二，三够的一九五五年是百分之四十点八，去年是百分之二十五。三够不足的，一九五五年是百分之四十四点七，去年就下降到百分之十三。我完全相信再经过一两年的努力，这个社的贫困面貌就可基本得到改变。
    生动的事实教育了每个农民，他们走社会主义道路的决心更加坚定了，生产积极性更加高涨了，以前有三户中农想退社，现在说：“我死也不退了”，单干的中农许明志说：“合作社不收我，赖我也是要赖到合作社的。”
    这个社的情况就是这样。我再一次说明，这只是我所看到的无数事例中的一个。我到其他县，他们也都非常系统具体的注意了对这一工作的领导。谷城县长对我说：“我是把这件事当成个重要政治任务去完成的。”出席这次会议的全国人大代表、特等农业劳动模范、谷城县新生活社主任、共产党员蔡以田同志的住房里就贴着一张困难户的名单，名单上有每一个困难户的具体安排规划和党支部对每户的分工负责人。蔡以田同志每月检查一次执行情况，他们的行动和广大农村工作干部、共产党员一样体现了他们关心群众疾苦的高贵品质，因而他们也受到人民群众的衷心爱戴。
    最近一个时期，在党的整风运动开展以后，我国的政治生活显得特别活跃，人民群众从爱护党、爱护社会主义事业的愿望出发，善意的向党提出了不少的批评和建设性的意见，这对于帮助党克服和防止前进中的缺点和错误，对于国家的社会主义建设事业无疑地将起到有益的作用。但是右派分子却用两面派的手法，在帮助党整风的幌子下，对党的领导、对社会主义事业展开了猖狂的进攻，他们叫嚷：“八年来的工作缺点是主要的”，“漆黑一团”，“人民生活下降了”，“什么事情都搞糟了”，他们要搞“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”，反对“党天下”，铲除“三害”的“根源”——无产阶级专政等等，他们这些得意忘形的野心家，企图把和风细雨的整风运动变成一股推翻党的领导、搞垮社会主义事业的狂风暴雨。
    右派分子的反动言论是经不起一驳的，几年来的生活实践对每一个中国人民都是极为深刻的教育。上面我向各位代表汇报的那些情况，中国农村在共产党的领导下打倒了骑在人民头上的地主恶霸及其他各种反动势力，在很短的时间内实现了农业合作化，发展了生产，改善了人民生活，困难户再过几年就不见了，难道这些叫“糟得很”吗？广大干部和千百万共产党员与人民群众同甘共苦建立了血肉相连的关系，如像蔡以田同志一样把困难户的名单贴在房子里，这就叫“共产党员脱离了人民群众”，“无恶不作”吗？我是个年近八十岁的人，我不但以自己的认识和经历拥护共产党的领导、拥护社会主义，作为一个中国人我自己感到无限光荣和自豪。八年前我们中国人民在中国共产党的领导下推翻了帝国主义对我们的压迫，推翻了骑在人民头上的作威作福的反动统治，人民自己在历史上第一次真正做了国家的主人，几年来我们又经历了天翻地覆的变革，我们已经做了旧中国几十年几百年所不能完成的工作，我们也正在做前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业，我国人民正在用自己的劳动迅速地改变着国家的面貌，难道这些是离开了共产党的领导所能够取得的吗？受人民爱戴的共产党绝不是一阵邪风就能够吹倒的。
    右派分子还有他们的市场，我们不能对各种形形色色的右派分子宽容，对他们的任何宽容，听任那些反动言论不加驳斥，就是对人民事业不负责任。我们必须在中国共产党的领导下站稳立场、明辨是非，划清界限，把右派分子的丑恶面目在人民群众的面前揭露无遗，保卫我们的革命成果，保卫我们的社会主义事业。
