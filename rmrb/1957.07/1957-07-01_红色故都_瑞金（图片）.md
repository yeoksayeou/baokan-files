	Red Capital—Ruijin
	Ruijin White Pagoda
	"The White Pagoda stands tall and majestic, the Mian River flows eastward, red sons and daughters advance wave upon wave, defying the bloody storms, the people of the red zone will always look towards Mao Zedong!" This is a poem written by the guerrilla fighters who persisted in the struggle in Ruijin after the Red Army's Long March. The picture above shows the White Pagoda standing on the banks of the Mian River described in the poem.

    红色故都—瑞金
    瑞金白塔
    “白塔巍峨矗立，绵江长流向东，红色儿女前仆后继，任凭血雨腥风，红区人民永远向着毛泽东！”这是红军长征以后，在瑞金坚持斗争的游击队员们写的一首诗。上图就是诗中所描写的矗立在绵江河畔的白塔。
