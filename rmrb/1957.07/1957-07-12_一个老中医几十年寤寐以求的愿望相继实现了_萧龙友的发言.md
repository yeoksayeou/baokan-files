A Few Words from an Old Practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xiao Longyou

Because I am ill, I am still unable to attend this meeting. I am making a written statement:

The Chinese Communist Party, in order to improve its work and eliminate the "three evils," is conducting a rectification movement and inviting non-Party members to offer criticisms and suggestions regarding the shortcomings and errors in the Party's work, in order to help the Party's internal rectification. It has opened up channels of communication widely and is receptive to advice, which is welcomed by everyone. Unexpectedly, in this movement, a few right-wing elements have taken this opportunity to launch malicious attacks against the Party and the People's Government, publishing many absurd statements that confuse black and white, distort right and wrong, and oppose the Party and socialism. They negate all the existing brilliant achievements, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party. But the facts are all there; how can petty people be allowed to quibble? Although I am old and have been ill for many years, upon hearing this, I feel indignant and compelled to speak out.

For a hundred years, our country has suffered from internal troubles and foreign invasions, and the country has been weak and the people poor. A great country with thousands of years of glorious culture was almost reduced to a colony, causing patriotic people to feel anxious and worried. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been working hard to govern the country, carrying out great construction and great revolution, and the country's destiny is becoming more prosperous and the people's livelihood is becoming richer. Not only are the 600 million people of the whole country rejoicing and encouraged, but also the world's attention has been shaken. This is a fact that everyone can see and hear. How can we allow people with ulterior motives to arbitrarily抹煞(erase)? Premier Zhou, in his government work report, spoke in detail about the great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction since the founding of the country, and refuted the fallacies of the right-wing elements without any remainder. I deeply feel that the Premier's report is exhaustive in its reasoning, righteous in its words, and I express my heartfelt support. I am an old TCM doctor and would like to say a few words based on my personal experience in TCM work. I have said several times that in the old society, TCM was discriminated against, and TCM doctors were squeezed out. The legacy of our national medicine was gradually facing the danger of being lost. After the establishment of the New China, under the correct leadership and vigorous call of the Party and the government, TCM has been widely valued, and the legacy of our national medicine is being excavated and reorganized. TCM doctors are playing their role in the people's health care to varying degrees, and everything is thriving. For example, the "Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine," "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine," and "Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital" are things that I have dreamed of for decades, and that I and many TCM colleagues have been striving for all our lives but have failed to realize. Recently, they have been established one after another, which is truly exciting! This alone can be representative of everything else. This is exactly what Chairman Mao has instructed: the Party and the government proceed from the 600 million people in handling affairs. Anything that is beneficial to the people and within our capabilities will definitely be done; conversely, anything that is unfavorable or harmful to the people will definitely be abolished and reformed. Many examples can prove this point. Is it only TCM?

Premier Zhou instructed in his report: "Among medical and health workers, there are still phenomena of disunity, lack of cooperation, and mutual disrespect. In the future, we should resolutely overcome these shortcomings, resolutely implement the mass line, thoroughly improve health and medical work, better发挥(bring into play) the strength of TCM, and strengthen the unity of medical and health personnel, so as to ensure further improvement of the people's health." I hope that colleagues in the medical field will well understand Premier Zhou's instruction, strengthen unity in the spirit of mutual learning, mutual assistance, and mutual respect, exert their strength, and make their due contributions to the great socialist construction cause of the motherland.

### 一个老中医几十年寤寐以求的愿望相继实现了  萧龙友的发言

    一个老中医几十年寤寐以求的愿望相继实现了
    萧龙友的发言
    我因有病，这次会议，仍不能出席，特作书面发言：
  中国共产党为了改进工作，清除“三害”进行整风运动，并邀请党外人士对党在工作中的缺点和错误，提出批评和建议，以帮助党内整风，广开言路，虚怀若谷，闻者莫不欣然。乃不意在运动中竟有少数右派分子，趁此机会对党和人民政府进行恶意攻击，发表许多混淆黑白，颠倒是非的反党和反社会主义的荒谬言论，否定一切已有的灿烂光辉的成绩，企图推翻党的领导，然事实俱在，岂容宵小置喙。余虽衰病经年，闻听之余，愤然于衷，实觉不能已于言。
    百年来，我国内忧外患，国弱民贫，有数千年悠久文化的大国几将沦为殖民地的惨境，爱国人士孰不惄焉心忧。解放后，在共产党和毛主席英明领导下，励精图治，大兴大革，国运日昌，民生日裕，不独全国六亿人民欢欣鼓舞，即世界视听亦为之震动，此乃有目共睹，有耳共闻的事实，岂容别有用心之人任意抹煞。周总理在政府工作报告中对于开国以来在社会主义改造和社会主义建设各方面的伟大成就，已言之綦详，对右派分子谰言驳斥无余。我深感总理的报告是尽情尽理，义正词严，衷心表示拥护。我是老中医，愿就个人在中医工作的体会略致数语。我曾几次讲过，在旧社会中，中医学是被歧视的，中医师是受排挤的，祖国医学遗产浸浸将不免于湮灭了。新中国建立后，在党和政府的正确领导和大力号召下，中医学已广泛受到重视，祖国医学遗产正在被发掘整理，中医师在不同程度上在人民保健事业中发挥着自己的作用，一切欣欣向荣。比如“中医研究院”，“中医学院”，“中医医院”，是我几十年来寤寐以求，毕生与许多中医同道共同争取而未能实现的事，近来都已相继成立起来了，能不令人兴奋！即此可概其余。这正是毛主席所指示的，党和政府办事是从六亿人民出发的。凡是有利于人民而又为力所能及的，一定办；反之，凡不利或有害于人民的，一定废革。许多事例，都能证明这一点。岂独中医学？
    周总理在报告中指示：“在医药、卫生工作人员中间，还存在着不团结合作和彼此不尊重的现象，今后应该坚决克服上述这些缺点，坚决贯彻群众路线，彻底改善卫生医药工作，更好地发挥中医的力量，加强医药卫生人员的团结，以保证进一步提高人民的健康水平。”我希望医界中同人很好地体会周总理这一指示，本着相互学习，相互帮助，相互尊重的精神，加强团结，发挥力量，在祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业中作出自己应有的贡献。
