Xinhua News Agency, 29th - According to TASS reports: Dr. Klobov, head of the Sino-Soviet comprehensive expedition team, recently told TASS reporters that the Amur (Heilongjiang) River has the hydropower capacity to generate 30 million kilowatts. Utilizing these hydropower resources, dozens of large-scale power stations can be built to serve the national economies of China and the Soviet Union.

Klobov said that dozens of locations suitable for building hydropower engineering hubs on the Amur River and its tributaries have been inspected. A series of hydroelectric and thermal power stations built in the Amur River basin will create conditions for establishing a unified power grid in the Soviet Far East and make it possible to connect the Soviet Far East power grid with the power grid of Northeast China. At the same time, the dams of these hydroelectric power stations can also regulate the water flow, preventing the Amur River and its tributaries from flooding during high water periods.

The expedition leader also emphasized the significance of the Amur River's hydropower for the development of industry in the Soviet Far East. He said that scholars have investigated the water and fuel resources of the Khabarovsk Territory. They believe that the Soviet Far East should become a major production base for the Soviet Union's energy-intensive chemical industries, especially light and rare metal industries, in the shortest possible time. The large hydroelectric power stations built on the Amur River and its tributaries will supply these industries with a large amount of cheap electricity, and their electricity costs will be much cheaper than the electricity produced by the hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River.

He also said that the new industrial sectors established in the Far East will help expand trade with People's China.

    让黑龙江为中苏人民服务
    中苏考察队查明水力可发电三千万瓩
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社报道：中苏综合考察队队长克洛波夫博士最近对塔斯社记者说，阿穆尔（黑龙江）河的水力具有三千万瓩的发电能力。利用这些水力资源可以建设几十个规模宏大的发电站。为中苏两国的国民经济服务。
    克洛波夫说，对阿穆尔河和它的支流的几十处适合于兴建水力工程枢纽的标线已经视察完毕。在阿穆尔河流域兴建的一连串水电站和热电站，将为建立苏联远东地区统一电力网创造条件，并且使得苏联的远东电力网有可能同中国东北的电力网连接起来。同时，这些水电站的水坝还可以调节水的流量，使阿穆尔和它的支流在涨水时不致于泛滥成灾。
    这位考察队长还着重谈到了阿穆尔河的水力对发展苏联远东地区的工业的意义。他说，学者们调查了伯力边疆区的水力和燃料资源。他们认为，苏联远东地区应该在最短时期内成为苏联的耗电量大的化学工业，特别是轻金属和稀有金属工业的生产大基地。在阿穆尔河和它的支流上建设的大水电站，就将为这些工业大量供应廉价的电力，它们的电力成本要比伏尔加河上的水电站生产的电力便宜得多。
    他还说，在远东地区建立起来的新的工业部门将有助于扩大同人民中国之间的商品交换。
