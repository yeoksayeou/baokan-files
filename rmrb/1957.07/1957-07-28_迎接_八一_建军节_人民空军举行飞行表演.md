Xinhua News Agency, July 27th -- This morning, in the skies over the southern suburbs of Beijing, several "silver swallows" rolled and flipped, performing many thrilling maneuvers, drawing cheers from thousands of people and attracting the attention of pedestrians. This was a flight demonstration held by the People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed in the capital to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. Two thousand five hundred people, including cadres, workers, young students, and Young Pioneers, attended today's air force flight demonstration.

	The flight demonstration began at 8:00 AM. Thousands of eyes watched as two jet fighters took off nimbly, and then disappeared into the clouds. After a while, two black dots appeared in the distant sky, but before people could identify them, they flashed over their heads like lightning. Particularly exciting for the audience was the complex and advanced aerobatic performance by Air Force Captain Zhang Qingxi, an Air Force commander, piloting a domestically produced 1956-type jet fighter. This aircraft rolled upwards like a gyroscope, and then somersaulted from high altitude and descended sharply. The silver aircraft circled, rose, and fell in the air like a ribbon. The excellent performance of China's domestically produced aircraft and the superb and skillful flying techniques of the Air Force pilots constantly aroused cheers from the audience.

	After the flight demonstration, at the audience's request, the pilots disembarked and met with the audience, and received red scarves presented by the Young Pioneers.

	Accompanied by Air Force cadres and soldiers, the audience visited the jet fighters and jet light bombers on the airfield, as well as the photo exhibition of the Air Force's growth and the specialized training rooms for auxiliary forces. In the evening, a gala was held, and the military education film "Air Combat Competition" was watched.

    迎接“八一”建军节
    人民空军举行飞行表演
    新华社27日讯　今天早晨，北京南郊上空，几架“银燕”横滚翻飞，表演了许多惊险动作，引起了上千人的欢呼和路上行人的注意。这是中国人民解放军空军驻首都部队为迎接“八一”建军节三十周年而举行的一次飞行表演。参观今天空军飞行表演的有干部、工人、青年学生和少先队员共二千五百人。
    飞行表演在八时开始。千百双眼睛注视着两架喷气歼击机矫捷起飞，随后它们就消逝在云空中。一会，远空中出现了两个黑点，但是当人们还未辨清的时候，它们已经闪电一样掠过人们头上。特别振奋观众的是由空军指挥员张清牺空军大尉驾驶我国自产1956年式喷气歼击机所作的复杂高级特技表演。这架飞机一会儿陀螺一样横滚上升，一会儿又从高空翻筋斗急降，银色的飞机像一根绸带一样在空中打圈，上下翻飞。我国国产飞机的优良性能和空军飞行员高超纯熟的飞行技术，不断引起观众们的欢呼。
    飞行表演结束后，飞行员们应观众的要求下机和观众见了面，并且接受了少先队员赠给的红领巾。
    观众们在空军干部、战士陪同下，参观了机场上的喷气歼击机和喷气轻轰炸机以及空军成长的图片展览和辅助部队训练的专修室等。晚间举行了联欢晚会，观看了“空中比武”军事教育片等。
