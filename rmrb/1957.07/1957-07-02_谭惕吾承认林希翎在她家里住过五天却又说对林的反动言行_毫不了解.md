Under the urging of the Hunan Province representatives, Tan Tiwu attended today's group meeting. In her speech, she disclaimed that she had "no knowledge" of Lin Xiling's activities in spreading reactionary remarks in several universities. She admitted that Lin Xiling had stayed in her home for five days some time ago. She did not explain her other relationships with Lin Xiling.

Today, many representative groups, in discussing Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state budget and final accounts, unanimously agreed with the report. In the Beijing Municipality representative group, many representatives discussed the issue of market prices. The representatives believed that market prices were basically stable last year, guaranteeing the lives of the broad masses of the people.

In the discussion of this report by representative groups from Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces, some representatives also criticized certain wasteful phenomena in construction projects, and demanded that the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country diligently and thriftily, be further implemented in the execution of the 1957 state budget. Some representatives from the Jiangxi Province group criticized the situation of some production units neglecting product quality. Representative Wu Youxun criticized the bad habit of some agencies, enterprises, and schools putting on airs. He hoped that the state would use appropriate methods to restrict the extravagant and wasteful phenomenon of putting on airs. Some representatives from the Hubei Province representative group believed that the work of increasing production and practicing economy should not only be carried out in industrial enterprises and other departments, but also in the vast countryside. Heilongjiang Province representative Ren Guodong criticized the serious waste in the reclamation of wasteland in the Mishan area by the Ministry of Land Reclamation. He said that the Ministry of Land Reclamation had already spent tens of millions of yuan in the Mishan area, but so far no farm has been established. He suggested that the central government organize an inspection team to inspect the Mishan area and correct this waste.

    谭惕吾在湖南省代表的督促下，出席了今天的小组会。她在发言中推托说她对林希翎在几个大学内散播反动言论的活动“毫不了解”。她承认林希翎在前些日子曾在她家里住了五天。她对于同林希翎的其他关系没有交代。
    今天许多代表小组在讨论李先念副总理关于国家预算决算报告中，一致同意这个报告。在北京市代表小组，许多代表谈了市场物价问题。代表们认为去年的市场物价基本上是稳定的，保证了广大人民的生活。
    青海、黑龙江、江西、湖北等省代表小组在讨论这个报告中，有些代表还批评了建设事业中的某些浪费现象，要求在执行1957年国家预算中，进一步贯彻执行增产节约，勤俭建国的方针。江西省小组有些代表批评了有些生产单位忽视产品质量的情况。代表吴有训批评了有些机关、企业、学校讲排场的不良风气。他希望国家用适当方法对讲排场的铺张浪费现象给予限制。湖北省代表小组有些代表认为，增产节约工作不仅要在工业企业等部门开展，同时也需要在广大农村开展。黑龙江省代表任国栋批评了农垦部在密山地区开垦荒地当中的严重浪费情况。他说，农垦部在密山地区已经花掉了几千万元，但是目前还没有一个农场固定下来。他建议中央组织检查组到密山地区检查，纠正这种浪费情况。
