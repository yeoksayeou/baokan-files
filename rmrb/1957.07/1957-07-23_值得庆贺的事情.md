Things Worth Celebrating
    By the People's Daily Commentator

    Recently, both Egypt and Syria have successively uncovered conspiracies by imperialist agents to assassinate national leaders and carry out subversive activities. The cracking of these conspiracies has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists who attempted to subvert the governments of Egypt and Syria. This is something worth celebrating.
    From the list of people whom the exposed conspirators intended to assassinate, it can be seen that the imperialists' purpose was to eliminate the patriotic people of Egypt and Syria who resolutely opposed colonialism, so that the pro-imperialist forces in these two countries could seize power, and then open the door to imperialism, causing the people of Egypt and Syria to once again fall under the dark colonial rule. Obviously, in order to extinguish the flames of the Egyptian and Syrian people in maintaining independence and opposing colonialism, and to establish their own colonial rule over the entire Middle East, the imperialists have become so frantic as to resort to any means. The imperialists once妄想wàngxiǎng tried to use economic pressure to force Egypt and Syria to submit, but this conspiracy failed. Egypt and Syria, relying on the help and support of many selfless friends, broke through the economic pressure of imperialism. The imperialists also attempted to create political turmoil in these two countries, but this conspiracy was also thwarted. So they resorted to the despicable means of assassination. And from the conspiracy case uncovered in Syria, it can be seen that the behind-the-scenes masterminds of these assassination plots are none other than the number one enemy of the Middle Eastern people today—American imperialism.
    The bankruptcy of the imperialist assassination plots in Egypt and Syria shows that the awareness and vigilance of the people of these two countries and the people of the Middle East have greatly increased. After World War II, the imperialists in the Middle East once used assassination as a major means to achieve their aggressive goals, and achieved some success. But today their conspiracy has repeatedly failed.
    Of course, the imperialists are not willing to give up. Now, they are eyeing these two countries that insist on independence, especially Syria. They will also use all means, including assassination, to deal with the anti-colonial forces in the Middle East. The British "Daily Mail" said that according to "authoritative sources" in London, the conspiracy to subvert the Egyptian government is still ongoing. This statement is not accidental.
    However, the cracking of the imperialist conspiracy case will undoubtedly further raise the vigilance of the Egyptian and Syrian people. They will more clearly recognize the imperialists' conspiratorial purposes, and more closely unite around the patriotic leaders of these two countries who resolutely oppose colonialism. This is the most powerful weapon for the people of the Middle East to defend their independence and smash any conspiracy of imperialism.
    Today is the day when the Egyptian people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution. While expressing our heartfelt congratulations to the Egyptian people, we also congratulate them on the victory they have achieved in opposing the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. We believe that the Egyptian people and the Syrian people will defend their hard-won independence like protecting their own eyes, and continue to smash any conspiracy of imperialism.

    值得庆贺的事情
    本报评论员
    最近，埃及和叙利亚都先后破获了帝国主义的代理人企图暗杀国家领导人、进行颠覆活动的阴谋案。这些阴谋案的破获，给了企图颠覆埃及和叙利亚政府的帝国主义者以沉重的打击。这是值得庆贺的事情。
    从已经揭露的阴谋分子打算加以暗杀的人的名单可以看出，帝国主义者的目的是要消灭埃及和叙利亚的坚决反对殖民主义的爱国人士们，以便这两个国家里的亲帝国主义势力夺取政权，然后向帝国主义敞开大门，使埃及和叙利亚人民再次沦于暗无天日的殖民统治之下。显然，帝国主义者为了扑灭埃及和叙利亚人民维护独立、反对殖民主义的火焰，建立自己对整个中东的殖民统治，已经疯狂到了不择手段的地步。帝国主义者曾经妄想用经济压力来迫使埃及和叙利亚屈服，可是这个阴谋失败了。埃及和叙利亚依靠着许多无私的朋友们的帮助和支持，冲破了帝国主义的经济压力。帝国主义者也曾经企图在这两个国家里制造政治动乱，可是这个阴谋也遭到了挫败。于是它就乞灵于卑鄙的暗杀手段。而从叙利亚所破获的阴谋案可以看出，这些暗杀阴谋的幕后主持人，正是中东人民当前的头号敌人——美帝国主义。
    帝国主义在埃及和叙利亚的暗杀阴谋的破产，说明这两个国家的人民和中东人民的觉悟和警惕已经大大提高。在二次大战以后，帝国主义者们在中东曾经用暗杀作为达到侵略目的的主要手段，并且取得了某些成功。但是今天他们的这种阴谋却一再地失败了。
    当然，帝国主义者们是不肯就此罢休的。现在，他们正在虎视眈眈地窥伺着这两个坚持独立的国家，特别是对叙利亚。他们还将使用一切手段，包括暗杀在内，来对付中东的反殖民主义力量。英国的“每日邮报”说，根据伦敦得到的“权威方面消息”，颠覆埃及政府的阴谋活动仍在继续中。这种说法并不是偶然的。
    但是，现在帝国主义的阴谋案的破获，无疑将更进一步提高埃及和叙利亚人民的警惕。他们将更清楚地认识到帝国主义的阴谋目的，更加紧密地团结在这两个国家的坚决反对殖民主义的爱国的领导人的周围。这是中东人民捍卫独立、粉碎帝国主义的任何阴谋的最有力的武器。
    今天是埃及人民庆祝埃及革命五周年的日子。我们在向埃及人民表示衷心的祝贺的同时，更祝贺他们在反对帝国主义的侵略阴谋中所取得的胜利。我们相信，埃及人民和叙利亚人民将像保护他们的眼珠一样保卫他们的得来不易的独立，继续粉碎帝国主义的任何阴谋。
