Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 29th: Hubei Province's first large-scale all-purpose printing and dyeing factory partially commenced production on the 27th. This factory can produce printed fabrics with six different colors and various colored fabrics, with an annual output of 1.8 million bolts. Its printed fabrics can meet the needs of the entire province.

The factory's main equipment and personnel were relocated from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Wuyi Printing and Dyeing Factory. The Wuyi Printing and Dyeing Factory originally could only produce more than 900,000 bolts of various colored fabrics annually. After relocating to Wuhan, due to the expansion of factory buildings, improved designs, and full utilization of the original equipment capacity, as well as the addition of a small number of machines, not only has the output increased by nearly one time, it is also expected that production costs will be greatly reduced.

In the past, fabrics produced in Hubei Province had to be transported to Shanghai for processing and dyeing. Now, with an all-purpose printing and dyeing factory, they can be processed and sold locally, saving the state a large amount of round-trip transportation costs.

    湖北省的全能印染厂
    新华社武汉29日电　湖北省第一座全能的大型印染厂在27日局部投入生产。这个厂可以生产套有六种不同颜色的印花布和各种色布，年产量达一百八十万匹。它所生产的印花布可以满足全省的需要。
    这个厂的主要设备和人员，都是从上海市公私合营无一印染厂迁来的。无一印染厂原来只能年产各色布匹九十多万匹；迁来武汉以后，由于扩大厂房，改进设计，充分利用了原有设备能力，同时增添了少部分机器，不但产量提高将近一倍，预计生产成本也将大大降低。
    湖北省生产的布匹过去必须运到上海去加工印染；现在有了全能印染厂，就可以就地加工、就地销售，使国家省去一大笔来往运输的费用。
