    Xinmin Daily News Examines Bourgeois Journalistic Viewpoints
    Seriously Corrects Two Erroneous Reports

    (Reported by this newspaper) The editorial department of Shanghai's Xinmin Daily News is, based on the newspaper's commentary "Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Direction for a Period," examining its propaganda work during this period and has already conducted self-criticism of two notably erroneous reports. On June 24th, Xinmin Daily News published news of the Shanghai judicial workers' symposium, exposing and criticizing the anti-socialist fallacies voiced at the Democratic League judicial symposium reported by the newspaper on May 19th. On the 25th, the newspaper published news of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee leading the "blooming and contending," correcting and criticizing the erroneous reports made by the newspaper on May 20th and 21st regarding the situation of "blooming and contending" in Zhejiang's literary and art circles. On the 25th, the newspaper also published an editorial titled "Firmly Establish Our Stance, Eradicate Errors," which made a preliminary self-criticism of the bourgeois journalistic viewpoints manifested in the newspaper's propaganda work.

    The report published by the newspaper on May 19th regarding the Democratic League judicial symposium exaggerated and sensationalized the remarks of the rightists, reporting many fabricated facts. The actual effect of this report was an attempt to completely negate the achievements of judicial work and viciously attack the worker-peasant cadres in judicial work positions.

    The reports published by the newspaper on May 20th and 21st regarding the "blooming and contending" in Zhejiang's literary and art circles were based solely on one-sided and unverified materials, and focused only on shortcomings in the work. Some of the individuals selected for interviews by the newspaper's reporter were elements who harbored dissatisfaction with the Party or even opposed the Party. The reporter believed these people's information without any analysis, and therefore the purpose of this report seriously distorted the true situation.

    The newspaper's news reports on the 24th and 25th made self-criticisms of the above-mentioned shortcomings. The newspaper's editorial "Firmly Establish Our Stance, Eradicate Errors" analyzed and criticized the ideological roots of these errors. The editorial pointed out:

    "What we are now exposing are merely two reports with conspicuously serious errors discovered by our editorial department during a preliminary examination of the pages after the People's Daily published the newspaper commentary 'Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Direction for a Period.' The editorial department's examination work is continuing to deepen. With the help of colleagues in the news industry and the broad masses of readers, and on the basis of our actively participating in the struggle against the rightists and gradually enhancing our understanding, we must also investigate and correct the shortcomings and errors in the remaining news reports, headlines, and articles."

    The editorial also pointed out: "After the Party launched the rectification movement, due to our one-sided understanding of 'blooming and contending,' we displayed an unstable stance and a lack of clarity between right and wrong, and adopted a liberal attitude towards certain erroneous remarks and criticisms that did not conform to the facts. As a result, articles that 'express bourgeois viewpoints without preparing to criticize them and sensational reports' have appeared more than once in the newspaper. What we are now exposing are merely two of the more serious ones, and even this examination is not very thorough. In the current fierce struggle against the rightists, the discovery of these errors has further deepened our sense of guilt towards the Party and the people. We are eager to make our preliminary self-criticism public to our readers, to express our sincerity and determination to eradicate errors.

    "The full text of Chairman Mao's speech 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People' has enlightened us and increased our ability to distinguish between right and wrong, while also strengthening our sense of political responsibility for the socialist cause. Based on our own painful experiences and lessons, we deeply feel that eradicating bourgeois journalistic viewpoints is a prerequisite for running a socialist newspaper well. Faced with a real life filled with ideological and political struggles, we must more urgently tackle this task well. We are prepared to study Chairman Mao's speech in depth and participate more actively in the struggle, 'learning, struggling, examining, and improving simultaneously,' exposing the errors and shortcomings in our work, criticizing bourgeois journalistic viewpoints, tempering ourselves in the struggle, firmly establishing a socialist stance, and running the people's newspaper well."

    新民报检查资产阶级新闻观点
    对两则错误报道进行了认真的纠正
    本报讯　上海新民报编辑部，正根据本报评论“文汇报在一个时间内的资产阶级方向”一文，检查这一时期的宣传工作，已对两篇错误显著的报道作了检讨。6月24日，新民报刊登了上海司法工作者座谈会的新闻，揭发和批评了5月19日该报报道的民盟司法座谈会上反社会主义的谬论。25日，该报又刊登了浙江省委领导鸣放的新闻，纠正和批评了该报5月20日和21日所作的关于浙江文艺界鸣放情况的错误报道。25日，该报还发表了以“站稳立场根除错误”为题的社论，初步检讨了该报宣传工作中所表现出的资产阶级新闻观点。
    该报5月19日刊登的关于民盟司法座谈会的报道，对于右派的言论夸大渲染，报道了很多捏造的事实。这一报道所起的实际作用，是企图完全否定司法工作的成绩，恶毒地打击司法工作岗位上的工农干部。
    该报5月20日和21日关于浙江省文艺界鸣放的报道，只根据片面的未加核实材料，又只着眼于工作中的缺点。该报记者所选择访问的某些对象，都是对党心怀不满甚至与党对抗的分子，记者对这些人所提供的情况不加分析一味相信，因而这一报道的目的，就严重地歪曲了真实情况。
    该报24日、25日的新闻，对上述缺点作了检讨。该报“站稳立场根除错误”的社论，分析批判了这些错误的思想根源。社论指出：
    “我们现在所揭露的，只是在人民日报发表报纸评论‘文汇报在一个时间内的资产阶级方向’后，我们编辑部初步检查版面时发现的两篇错误显著严重的报道。目前编辑部的检查工作正在继续深入进行，在新闻同业和广大读者的帮助下，在我们积极参加反对右派的斗争、逐步提高认识的基础上，我们一定要把其余一些新闻、标题、文章中的缺点和错误，也清查出来，予以纠正。”
    社论还指出：“在党开展整风运动以后，由于我们片面理解鸣放，表现了立场不稳，是非不明，对某些错误言论和不符事实的批评采取自由主义的态度，因而在报纸上不止一回的出现了‘表现资产阶级观点而并不准备批判的文章和带煽动性的报道’。现在所揭露的，不过是其中较严重的两篇，这里的检查也是很不深刻的。在当前激烈的反右派斗争中，发现了这些错误，更加重了我们对党和人民负疚的心情，我们迫不及待的要把初步的检查先公之于读者面前，表示我们根除错误的诚意和决心。
    “毛主席‘关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题’讲话全文发表，使我们的眼睛亮了一点，增加了辨别是非的能力，同时也加强了我们对社会主义事业的政治责任心。我们根据自己的痛切经验教训，深深觉得根除资产阶级新闻观点，是把社会主义报纸办好的先决条件，面对着充满思想斗争和政治斗争的现实生活，我们更须迫切做好这个课题。我们预备深入学习毛主席的讲话，更加积极地参加斗争，‘边学习，边斗争，边检查改进’，揭露自己工作中的错误和缺点，批判资产阶级新闻观点，在斗争中锻炼自己，站稳社会主义立场，办好人民的报纸。”
