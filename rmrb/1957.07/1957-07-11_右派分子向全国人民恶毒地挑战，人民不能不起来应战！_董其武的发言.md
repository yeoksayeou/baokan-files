This People's Congress is of great historical significance. It marks that our great socialist construction cause, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is advancing step by step from victory to victory. Before the meeting, we studied and discussed Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Although it was a preliminary study, I realized that Chairman Mao's important and brilliant instruction will not only have a profound and far-reaching impact on raising the political consciousness of the Chinese people and promoting the victorious development of China's socialist cause, but also provide a creative example of applying Marxism-Leninism in the international arena.

During the meeting, I listened to Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report." This report used irrefutable facts to illustrate the tremendous achievements of China's socialist transformation and socialist construction, and also used equally irrefutable facts to give a powerful counterattack to the bourgeois rightists. Therefore, I sincerely and wholeheartedly support it. I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen.

In recent times, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life across the country have been launching a powerful criticism of the reactionary remarks of the rightists. I think this is absolutely necessary. Originally, the Chinese Communist Party, based on Chairman Mao's instruction "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," launched a rectification movement throughout the Party, and sincerely hoped that non-Party members would offer criticisms and opinions to help the Party rectify its work. This fully demonstrates the Chinese Communist Party's high sense of responsibility to serve the people and the proletariat's selfless and open-mindedness. Every conscientious Chinese should, with a heart that loves the Party and loves the socialist cause, realistically examine our work, correctly estimate our achievements, and seriously and earnestly put forward constructive opinions, thereby helping the Party educate cadres, helping the Party correct the shortcomings and errors of some Party members, improve work, further strengthen the unity of the people across the country, and further advance China's socialist cause. However, the rightists, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work, fabricated rumors, distorted facts, and attempted to undermine the healthy development of the rectification movement and shake the foundation of our country. This means that the rightists have deliberately challenged the Party and the people of the whole country, and have done so frantically and viciously. Therefore, the people cannot but rise to fight back. Once the fight begins, it must be fought to the end, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory.

Great Achievements Are Encouraging

The great achievements China has made under the leadership of the Communist Party in the past eight years are deeply engraved in everyone's heart and cannot be denied by anyone. Premier Zhou has already listed many moving figures in his report. Comparing the planned figure of China's total industrial output value in 1957 with the actual figure in 1952, it increased by 1.2 times, that is, an increase of 33.3 billion yuan. In terms of steel production, the total output in the first five-year plan will reach 16.3 million tons, while in old China (including Northeast China during the Japanese occupation), from 1900 to 1948, the total steel output in 49 years was only 7.6 million tons. During the period of the first five-year plan, the more than 800 industrial enterprises above the limit, many water conservancy projects and railway projects, and the Yangtze River Bridge project, etc., that we started to build were all relatively large in scale and technologically new. Among them, the 156 construction projects designed and equipped by the Soviet Union are all top-notch in technology. During the first five-year plan period, 8,500 kilometers of new railways were built, while the Kuomintang government built only more than 2,600 kilometers during its 22 years of rule. During the first five-year plan period, the number of graduates from universities and colleges reached 280,000, while in old China, from 1912 to 1947, the total in 36 years was only more than 210,000. In terms of agricultural production, taking grain and cotton as examples, the total actual output in the five years from 1952 to 1956 was 1,658 billion catties of grain and 130 million dan of cotton. In old China, from 1932 to 1936, the five years were years with relatively good agricultural harvests before our liberation, and the total grain output was only 1,300 billion catties, and the total cotton output was only 60.5 million dan. From the perspective of total agricultural output value, it has been increasing year by year since liberation. In 1949, the total national agricultural output value was 32.6 billion yuan, and in 1956 it rose to 58.3 billion yuan, an increase of 79 percent compared with 1949. With the growth of total agricultural output value, the purchasing power of farmers has also greatly increased: in 1950, the purchasing power of the people across the country was 8.1 billion yuan, and in 1956 it rose to 19.1 billion yuan, an increase of 136 percent compared with 1950. These are all sharply contrasting figures, encouraging figures, and true and accurate facts. The rightists insist on denying everything, remain silent about achievements, and say that "achievements are primary and shortcomings are secondary" is a dogmatic formula. This is not about formula or not, this is an attempt to discredit the leadership of the Communist Party and the fundamental system of our country by negating achievements and exaggerating shortcomings. What exactly are their intentions? May I ask: Without the leadership of the Communist Party, could we have driven the imperialist forces that had invaded our country for a century out of mainland China so cleanly and thoroughly? Could we have overthrown the bureaucratic capital and feudal forces that were riding on the people's heads? Could we have achieved the true unification of the country? Could we have made all ethnic groups in the country unite like a family with equality, friendship, and love? Could we have opened up a bright and happy socialist future for us? Could we have such a lofty international status as we have now? It can be said with certainty that without the leadership of the Communist Party, none of this would have been possible; without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Therefore, the people of the whole country have unanimously expressed infinite excitement and sincere support for the Party's leadership, for the great achievements of the motherland's construction in recent years, and for the beautiful future of socialism. However, the rightists have a completely different view and a completely different language. This shows that the rightists are opposed to the people of the whole country on the fundamental issue of stand. If this fundamental stand is not changed, they will never have the feelings and language of the people, and the people will never be able to regard them as their own.

Facts Speak Louder Than Words; Fallacies Cannot Deceive the People

The rightists say that more than 90 percent of Communist Party members are bad. What kind of talk is this? This is truly a shameless slander against outstanding Communist Party members. In the past few years, I have worked with many Communist Party members in the army and have contacted many Communist Party members in the local areas. My personal experience is that the vast majority of Communist Party members serve the people wholeheartedly, are not afraid of difficulties, do not hesitate to sacrifice, and fight loyally for the revolutionary cause. May I ask: Without such iron-willed Communist Party members selflessly implementing policies, could we have achieved such great achievements today in the establishment of New China and socialist construction? Of course, the democratic parties and the broad masses of patriotic people have also played an active role in their work, and the broad masses of workers and peasants are the basic forces that directly create wealth. However, Communist Party members always stand at the forefront of various struggles, endure hardship first, lead by example, and lead the masses forward. Taking the fact that Hebei Province suffered from floods last year as an example, local cadres from the provincial level to the county, district, and township levels, as well as the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the local area, all joined the people in the intense flood prevention and drainage struggle. Party member cadres all showed the most active and courageous performance in the struggle. There is an old saying in China, "One year of disaster, three years of suffering." If it were not for the care and rescue of the People's Government after a serious flood like the one in Hebei last year, I don't know how many people would have been displaced, selling their wives and children, and even starving to death. In New China, thanks to the Party and the government allocating a large amount of grain to the disaster areas, and with Party member cadres leading the people in production for self-salvation by setting an example, not only did no one starve to death, but many disaster-stricken areas created conditions for the next year's bumper harvest. How can it be said that more than 90 percent of Communist Party members are bad? People who say such things can truly be said to be too unconscionable. There are also very few Party members who, due to insufficient study, have been infected with bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism; but this is precisely the reason why the Communist Party has proposed rectification. After rectification and education, these shortcomings can be corrected.

The rightists say that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, Three-Anti, and Five-Anti movements were messed up. This is also exaggerating shortcomings and negating achievements. In the uprising troops where I was located, just like in society, a series of transformation work was carried out through the democratic movement and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries, Three-Anti, and other movements. I believe that the various movements as a whole are healthy. If we had not gone through these transformations, it would have been impossible to abandon old ideas, accept new ideas, and truly stand on the people's stand. From the perspective of the various reform movements in society, if we had not gone through the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement, the broad masses of oppressed working people would not have been able to raise their heads. Could we have such good social order today? Could we guarantee the smooth progress of our socialist construction? If we had not gone through the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, could we have transformed capitalist industry and commerce so smoothly? We can also ask: Were these great movements for the consolidation of our regime? Were they for the highest interests of the broad masses of the people? If the answers to these questions are all affirmative, then the achievements of the various movements must be great. Are there also some shortcomings? It is impossible to demand that such a large-scale mass movement have no shortcomings at all. The question is how to view these shortcomings. Before the start of the movement and during the movement, the Party Central Committee and Party organizations paid attention to preventing deviations and preventing shortcomings in all aspects. According to Chairman Mao's principle of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected," we must not only eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, but also not wrong a single good person. In the various movements in the troops where I was located, there were also very few individuals and individual events that were not handled properly because the materials and historical situation were not clear at the time, or were handled inappropriately after being demobilized and returning to their hometowns because the situation was not well understood. However, as soon as they were discovered, they were immediately investigated and studied, and handled realistically. Even now, my unit still has more than a dozen cadres organized to continue the investigation and handling. From my experience, the Communist Party never covers up shortcomings, nor does it insist on mistakes, but is courageous in exposing shortcomings and correcting mistakes. Because the Communist Party has no selfishness, they are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice for the cause of the Party and the people. Are they still afraid of correcting some shortcomings and mistakes? The rightists seize on some individual and local shortcomings in the work, and exaggerate and clamor, and no explanation can be obtained other than ulterior motives.

Open Your Eyes and Strive for the Socialist Construction of the Motherland

I came from the army. When we heard the anti-socialist remarks of the rightists in the garrison, all the commanders and fighters expressed great indignation. This is completely natural, because the rightists are attempting to destroy the revolutionary achievements that countless martyrs exchanged for blood and sacrifice, and attempting to undermine our great socialist construction. Commanders and fighters with a high degree of political consciousness will of course be indignant and will of course fight back. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to launch a thorough criticism of the rightists. Doing so can not only make the rightists clear-headed, but also educate the people of the whole country. As a loyal people's soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I personally must study hard, improve my awareness, open my eyes, and hold my weapon tightly, and under the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend the sacred and inviolable national defense of the motherland. Any domestic and foreign reactionary forces that dare to undermine the people's revolutionary cause will be resolutely struck down by us.

### 右派分子向全国人民恶毒地挑战，人民不能不起来应战！  董其武的发言

    右派分子向全国人民恶毒地挑战，人民不能不起来应战！
    董其武的发言
    这次的人民代表大会是具有重大历史意义的。它标志着我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，在中国共产党的领导下正在一步一步地由胜利走向胜利。在会议前，我们学习和讨论了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，虽然是初步的学习，但我体会到毛主席这一重大的英明的指示，不但对提高我国人民的政治觉悟、推进我国社会主义事业的胜利发展，将发生极其深刻和久远的影响，而且在国际上又一次提供了创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的范例。
    在会议中听了周总理的“政府工作报告”，这个报告以无可辩驳的事实说明我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的巨大成就，也同样以无可辩驳的事实给资产阶级右派分子以有力地回击，所以我是出于至诚的表示，衷心的拥护。对李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和张鼎丞检察长、董必武最高人民法院院长及彭真副委员长兼秘书长的各项报告，我完全同意。
    在最近一时期中，全国各地广大工人、农民群众和各方面人士，正在对右派分子的反动言论，展开有力的批判，我认为这是完全必要的。本来，中国共产党根据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，在全党展开整风运动，并热诚地希望党外人士提出批评和意见，来帮助党整风，这充分表现了中国共产党为人民服务的高度负责精神及工人阶级先锋队大公无私的坦荡胸怀，每一个有良心的中国人，都应该以热爱党、热爱社会主义事业的心情，实事求是地检查我们的工作，正确地估计成绩，严肃认真地提出建设性的意见，从而帮助党教育干部，帮助党纠正某些党员的缺点和错误，改进工作，进一步加强全国人民的团结，进一步把我国社会主义事业推向前进。而右派分子竟有借帮助党整风的幌子，捏造谣言，抹煞事实，妄想破坏整风运动的健康发展，妄想动摇我们国家的根本。这就是说右派分子已经有意地向党和全国人民挑战了，而且是疯狂地恶毒地挑战，所以人们是不能不起来应战的。一经应战，一定要打到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    伟大的成绩令人鼓舞
    我国在共产党领导下，八年来所取得的伟大成绩是深深地刻在每个人的心坎中，是任何人也抹煞不了的。周总理在报告中已经列举出许多动人心弦的数字。我国的工业总产值，以一九五七年的计划数字同一九五二年的实际数字作比较，增长一点二倍，即增加三百三十三亿元。以钢的产量来讲，第一个五年合计，将达到一千六百三十万吨，而旧中国（包括日本侵占时候的东北在内）从一九○○年到一九四八年，四十九年合计钢的产量不过七百六十万吨。在第一个五年计划期内，我们开工建设的八百多个限额以上的工业企业，许多水利工程和铁路工程以及长江大桥工程等等，规模都比较大，技术都比较新，其中由苏联帮助设计和供应设备的一百五十六项建设工程，在技术上都是头等的。第一个五年计划期间，新建铁路八千五百公里，而国民党政府在二十二年的统治期间只修建了二千六百多公里。第一个五年计划期间高等学校的毕业生达到二十八万人，而旧中国从一九一二年到一九四七年，三十六年合计还不过二十一万人。在农业生产方面，以粮食和棉花来讲，一九五二年到一九五六年，五年间的实际产量合计，粮食为一万六千五百八十亿斤，棉花为一亿三千万担，而旧中国从一九三二年到一九三六年五年间是我国解放前农业收成比较好的年份，粮食产量合计只有一万三千亿斤，棉花产量合计只有六千零五十万担，从农业总产值上看，解放以来一直是逐年上升的，一九四九年全国农业总产值是三百二十六亿元，一九五六年上升到五百八十三亿元，比一九四九年增加了百分之七十九。随着农业总产值的增长，农民的购买力也大大提高了：一九五○年全国人民的购买力是八十一亿元，一九五六年上升到一百九十一亿元，比一九五○年增长了百分之一百三十六。这些都是对比鲜明的数字，令人欢欣鼓舞的数字，而又是千真万确的事实。右派分子偏偏要一笔抹煞，缄口不谈成绩，并且说什么：“成绩是主要的、缺点是次要的”是教条主义的公式。这不是什么公式不公式，这是企图用否定成绩夸大缺点的办法诋毁共产党的领导，诋毁我们国家的根本制度。究竟是何居心？试问：没有共产党的领导，我们能把百年来侵略我国的帝国主义势力这样干净彻底地赶出中国大陆吗？能把骑在人民头上的官僚资本和封建势力推翻吗？能实现全国的真正统一吗？能使全国各民族像一家人一样地平等友爱地团结起来吗？能给我们开辟了光明的幸福的社会主义前途吗？能有现在这样崇高的国际地位吗？可以肯定讲：没有共产党的领导，就不可能有这一切，没有共产党就没有新中国。因而全国人民对党的领导、对几年来祖国建设的巨大成就、对社会主义的美好前途，一致表示无限兴奋，竭诚的拥护。而右派分子偏偏是另外一种看法，另外一种语言，这就说明在根本的立场问题上右派分子和全国人民是对立的。这个根本立场不改变，他们就永远不能有人民的感情、人民的语言，人民也永远不能把他们当作自己人看待。
    事实胜于雄辩  谬论骗不了人民
    右派分子说：共产党员百分之九十以上是坏的。这是什么话？这真是对优秀的共产党员无耻的诬蔑；这几年来我在部队中和许多共产党员在一起工作，在地方上接触了许多共产党员，我的亲身体验是绝大多数的共产党员都是全心全意为人民服务的，不怕困难、不惜牺牲，忠心耿耿地为革命事业奋斗。试问：新中国的建立和社会主义的建设，如果没有这样坚如铁石的共产党员奋身忘我地执行政策，我们能取得今天这样巨大的成绩吗？当然，各民主党派和广大爱国人士也在工作中起了积极的作用，广大工农群众是直接创造财富的基本力量，但共产党员总是站在各种斗争的最前列，吃苦在前，以身作则，带领群众前进。就以河北省去年遭受水灾的事实为例，地方上从省级到县、区、乡级干部，人民解放军驻在当地的指战员都和人民群众一起投入紧张的防洪排涝斗争，党员干部在斗争中都表现得最积极、最勇敢。旧中国有句话，叫“一年遭灾，三年受害”。像河北去年那样严重的水灾，要不是在人民政府的关怀救护下，不知道要有多少人颠沛流离，鬻妻卖子，甚至于饿死。在新中国，由于党和政府大量向灾区调拨粮食，而又以党员干部以身作则地领导人民生产自救，不但没有饿死人，而且有不少遭灾地区为下一年的丰产创造了条件。这怎能说共产党员百分之九十以上都是坏的呢？说这样话的人真可说是太没良心了。也有极个别的党员，由于学习不够，沾染了官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的毛病；但这也正是共产党提出整风的原因。经过整风教育，这些缺点是可以改正的。
    右派分子讲：肃反、三反、五反等运动搞糟了，这也是夸大缺点、抹煞成绩。在我所在的起义部队中也同社会上一样，经过了民主运动和肃反、三反等一系列改造工作。我认为各种运动整个的讲是健康的，如果不经过这些改造，就不可能抛弃旧思想、接受新思想，就不可能真正站到人民立场上来。从社会上历次改革运动讲，如果不经过肃反运动，广大的被压迫的劳动人民就抬不起头来，能有今天这样良好的社会秩序吗？能保证我们社会主义建设的顺利进行吗？如果不经过三反、五反运动，我们能对资本主义工商业改造的这样顺利吗？我们还可以问：这几次伟大的运动是不是为了我们的政权巩固？是不是为了广大人民群众的最高利益？如果这些问题的答案都是肯定的，那么历次运动的成绩肯定是伟大的。是不是也有些缺点呢？这样大的群众性运动，要求一点缺点也没有是不可能的，问题是如何看待这些缺点。在运动开始前和运动进行中，党中央和党组织都从各方面注意了防止偏差，防止缺点。根据毛主席“有反必肃、有错必纠”的原则，我们既要肃清一切反革命，也要不冤枉一个好人。在我所在的部队历次运动中，也有极个别的人、个别的事，因为材料和历史情况当时搞不清楚，处理的不够适当，或者复员还乡后，因为情况了解不够，处理的有些不当，但只要一经发觉，就立刻进行调查和研究，实事求是地加以处理，直到现在我部还组织有十几个干部继续在调查处理中。以我的体会，共产党从来不掩盖缺点，也从来不坚持错误，而是勇于揭发缺点、改正错误的。因为共产党没有私，他们为了党和人民的事业流血牺牲都不怕，难道还怕改正一些缺点和错误吗？右派分子抓住工作中一些个别的局部的缺点，就夸大其词，乱叫乱嚷，除了别有用心以外，再也得不到任何解释。
    擦亮眼睛，为祖国社会主义建设而奋斗
    我是从部队里来的，当我们在驻地听到了右派分子反社会主义的言论时，全体指战员都表示非常愤慨，这是完全自然的，因为右派分子正是企图毁坏他们无数先烈流血牺牲所换来的革命成果，企图破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设，有高度政治觉悟的指战员，当然要愤慨，当然要反击。所以对右派分子展开彻底的批判是十分必要的，这样做不但可以使右派分子头脑清醒，而且也可以使全国人民受到教育。我个人作为人民解放军的一个忠实的人民战士，一定要努力学习，提高觉悟，擦亮眼睛，握紧武器，在伟大的共产党、毛主席的领导下，来保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫祖国神圣不可侵犯的国防，任何敢于破坏人民革命事业的国内外反动势力，都将遭到我们坚决的打击。
