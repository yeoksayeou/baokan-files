I fully support Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports. Now I will express some opinions on the purge work in Sichuan Province.

Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou's report's summary conclusions on China's purge movement, as seen from the purge work in Sichuan, are completely correct and consistent with the actual situation.

**The Purge Work Greatly Purified the Revolutionary Organization, and the Achievements Are Enormous**

Since the autumn of 1955, Sichuan launched a large-scale movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries throughout the province. The development of the struggle was basically normal and healthy, and great achievements were obtained. Where are our huge achievements in the purge mainly reflected? First of all, a large number of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements were found. As of April 1957, a total of more than 5,300 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements had been investigated and finalized in the province. At the same time, in the political offensive launched last year, as of the end of December, according to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 counter-revolutionaries and other criminals surrendered themselves in the province. Among the large number of counter-revolutionaries found, some were deeply hidden, owed blood debts, and were extremely guilty and unpopular. For example, Xia Huizhong, a professional spy found in the Chongqing shipping department, was the "Xia District Captain" of the "Shangrao Concentration Camp" with blood on his hands. Lu Gang, found in Chengdu, was a bandit "Commander of the Yunnan-Guizhou Column of the Chinese Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Allied Army" who had been wanted for a long time in Pan County, Guizhou. A major counter-revolutionary element lurking in the Pingwu County Hospital was the "Pacification Commander" of Qinghai appointed by Chiang Kai-shek, and was only found this time. It is particularly worth noting that among the counter-revolutionaries seized, some had infiltrated the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, and some had even usurped leadership positions. For example, Lei Pirong, who had served as the Chief Procurator of the Jianyang County People's Procuratorate, a member of the Jianyang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee, was originally a habitual bandit who had murdered peasants in 1937. Another example is Li Huifang, who was appointed Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Rong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1952. It was found that he was a traitor and traitor who had sold out five party members and collected information about our Eighth Route Army for the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Through the purge movement, this large group of vicious and hidden enemies was identified, greatly purifying the revolutionary organization, and at the same time educating the broad masses, improving their socialist awareness and political vigilance, and distinguishing the enemy from ourselves. This not only further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, but also greatly promoted the development of the socialist revolution.

The large-scale purge movement launched in the autumn of 1955 was carried out under what circumstances? It was carried out on the eve of the victory of the Five-Anti Movement and the coming of the socialist revolution climax. That is to say, although the past Five-Anti Movement, especially the past social suppression of counter-revolutionaries, had directly given serious blows to counter-revolutionaries, many deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries had slipped through the net. And this group of counter-revolutionaries, seeing that the Chinese revolution was about to enter the climax of the socialist revolution, tried to carry out crazy sabotage from all aspects in order to carry out their deathbed struggle. Therefore, the situation at that time was facing such a topic, that is, it was necessary to completely resolve the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, crack down on and crush the enemy's sabotage activities, pave the way for the three major transformations, and lay the foundation for the smooth advancement and completion of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, the purge movement launched in the autumn of 1955 actually began with crushing the rampant attack of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, thereby launching a movement throughout the country to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries. This was a serious class struggle to resolve the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. The movement ended with the people winning a great victory and the main forces of the counter-revolutionaries being basically purged.

As mentioned above, the purge movement in Sichuan, like other provinces and regions in the country, achieved great results, but also had some shortcomings and deviations. These are mainly reflected in the following two aspects: on the one hand, there were individual cases of excessive struggle, that is, some who could be arrested or not arrested, or those who should not be arrested at all were arrested; on the other hand, there were those who should have been arrested, sentenced, and imprisoned but were not arrested, sentenced, and imprisoned. It must be pointed out that although the occurrence of the above-mentioned shortcomings and deviations is a loss in the strict sense of the requirements of the purge work, generally speaking, the achievements are very great. Moreover, with regard to the former type of shortcomings and deviations, some have been corrected in time after being discovered, especially after the major inspection last year, most of the cases with existing problems have been dealt with, or are continuing to be reviewed and dealt with. As for the latter type of shortcomings and deviations, as long as we are not complacent, some counter-revolutionaries who have slipped through the net will eventually escape the net of the people. Generally speaking, the achievements are the main and huge ones. This fact is beyond doubt and undeniable. However, can we reach a consensus on this realistic conclusion that the achievements of China's purge movement are the main and basic ones with a few right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and their agents in Sichuan, Pan Dakui? From the past, especially from the thoughts and actions of the right-wingers exposed in Sichuan in the past month or so, two completely opposite views and opposite conclusions have been drawn. Where are these different views and different conclusions reflected?

**Pan Dakui and Other Rightists in Sichuan Want to "Rehabilitate" Those Who Have Been "Wronged" in Previous Movements, Attack Active Elements in Past Purge Movements, Form So-Called Public Opinion Pressure, and Attempt to Isolate the Party and Damage the Party's Prestige Among the Masses**

First of all, we believe that our purge achievements in the past few years are the main and huge ones, while Pan Dakui and other rightists believe that they have been messed up and wrong, and do not know how many people have been wrongly arrested, imprisoned, and killed. Therefore, they believe that the errors and deviations in the purge work are the main ones, and are nationwide. For example, Luo Longji said to Pan Dakui, Fan Puzhai and others during his inspection in Chengdu, "The Hu Feng case was wrong, Hu Feng is not a counter-revolutionary," and so on. Luo Longji's view was agreed by Pan Dakui, Fan Puzhai and others. Han Wenwei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Democratic League, also accused and slandered many of our practices in the purge work as "violating" the constitution. For example, he said that previous movements were based on the "bold suspicion" and "arbitrary identification" of some powerful people, and that they arbitrarily detained and insulted "citizens they did not believe in" (including counter-revolutionaries), infringing on personal freedom. "Only a few people with special powers who can suspect others without being suspected can be spared from this fear." Therefore, they demanded that the achievements of the purge movement "should be re-evaluated."

Secondly, we believe that the reason why the purge movement was relatively thorough and able to achieve great results was mainly because we adopted the mass line of combining the business departments such as public security, procuratorate, and courts with mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses under the unified leadership of the Party and the government. And the reason why this line is relatively correct and less prone to deviations in the development of the movement is not because the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are particularly clever, but mainly because it has summarized and developed the anti-purge experience in the revolutionary struggle in China in recent decades. However, Pan Dakui and other rightists believe that the Party's leadership of the purge work is illegal, and they also oppose the mass line in the purge movement and purge work. Moreover, some people believe that the reason why the purge work is prone to deviations and errors is mainly due to the "ignorance" of the masses (meaning they do not have legal knowledge, and some people believe that "cadres do not have a considerable cultural foundation and cannot distinguish between good people and bad people") and the ease of "extremism." And their so-called deviations and errors not only believe that some mass struggles are "excessive" and "exaggerated," but also regard mass small-group reasoning criticisms and small-group ideological reviews as "private trials," or regard the mass's benevolent temporary co-residence for those who are criticized in order to prevent accidents as "private prisons." The purpose of this kind of vicious slander and rumor-mongering is not only to try to make the purge movement leave the reliance of the masses and the leadership of the Party, making it difficult for the movement to unfold and the struggle powerless, unable to accurately and powerfully strike at the enemy, but also to slander the masses, slander the Party, and attempt to provoke the normal relationship between the Party and the masses, the Party and the government, and so on. The rightists' intentions are very sinister, and we must not be fooled.

Thirdly, we have repeatedly affirmed that certain shortcomings and deviations in the purge work should be reviewed and corrected, and in fact, we have completely adhered to the Party and government's policy of "all counter-revolutionaries must be purged, and all mistakes must be corrected," and have been constantly inspected and corrected by relevant departments. In particular, after a comprehensive inspection of the purge work was carried out last year, the problems that existed in the past purge work have been basically resolved. But what is the rightists' view on this issue? They are completely in the position of vicious opponents. Not only do they not believe that the Party and the government can "correct all mistakes," but they also recognize that the shortcomings and deviations in the purge work are the main ones, then their other conspiracy, that is, the issue of organizing a "rehabilitation committee," will inevitably be put forward. Pan Dakui, a rightist in Sichuan, reproduced Luo Longji's "rehabilitation committee" in Sichuan, and even more creatively expanded the scope of "rehabilitation." He not only advocated "rehabilitating" those who were "wronged" in the 1955 purge work in the organs, but also advocated "rehabilitating" those who were "wronged," attacked, and struggled in the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti" and previous movements; he not only advocated "rehabilitating" the living, but also "rehabilitating" the dead; not only "rehabilitating" those who were suppressed, but also "rehabilitating" those who committed suicide for fear of punishment. In order to achieve their goal of negating achievements and promoting the realization of the organization of the "rehabilitation committee," Pan Dakui greatly admired and praised Huang Shaohong's method of negating achievements and exaggerating shortcomings in Zhejiang's inspection of the purge work, and was determined to follow his example and also inspect and find serious errors related to the purge work in Sichuan. In particular, Pan Dakui and others believe that the time for negating the achievements of the purge is ripe, so they took the opportunity of the Party calling on non-Party people to help the Party rectify its work and spoke freely, using the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people as an excuse to cover up their opposition to the various measures we took in the past to resolve the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. Under this attempt, they arranged a set of slogans such as "removing hats," "relieving the siege," and "insurance"; and adopted methods such as individual visits, inviting people to dinner, and holding forums to specifically mobilize people who have opinions on the Party and the government to speak freely, and collected and spread their dissatisfaction; at the same time, they mobilized these people to stir up trouble, and used various means to isolate and attack active elements in the past purge movement, forming so-called social public opinion pressure, in an attempt to isolate the Party and damage the Party's prestige among the masses, and achieve Pan Dakui's goal of "the rehabilitation agency must be established." Some confidants of Luo Longji in the Sichuan Democratic League specifically collected more than 100 "accusations" and "complaints" of this kind in major colleges and universities, which is part of the basis for his proposal to organize a "rehabilitation committee" at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. And the materials of Zhao Yiming, Shu Jun, and Li Kang and other anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wingers in the Sichuan Democratic League that have been exposed recently are based on this intention of Luo Longji, Pan Dakui and others to deploy and carry out work.

**The Purpose of the Rightists Is to Protect the Class Interests Represented by a Few Rightists, to Oppose the People's Democratic Dictatorship, and to Attempt to Replace It With Bourgeois Democracy and Dictatorship**

The above are some completely different and opposing views between the rightists in Sichuan and us on the issue of the purge. Why are there these two different views? At the same time, what are the purposes and intentions of the rightists' attempts to obliterate the facts, exaggerate the shortcomings, negate the achievements, oppose the Party's leadership and the mass line in the purge movement, and advocate the establishment of a "rehabilitation committee"? Obviously, any thought, proposition, and action are reflections of a certain class stand and class viewpoint. The reason why the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen, and all patriotic people in the country actively support and uphold the policy of the Party and the government to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, and truthfully admit the huge achievements of the purge, is mainly because they have long been severely squeezed, devastated, and persecuted by landlords, bureaucrats, and special agent counter-revolutionary elements in the past, so they can clearly stand firmly on the position of the proletariat and the people, and fight against all thoughts and actions that violate the interests of the people. The purpose of the struggle is also very clear, that is, mainly to defend the fruits of the people's revolution, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and defend the interests of socialist construction. The reason why the bourgeois rightists want to negate the achievements of the purge, exaggerate the shortcomings, and "speak out for injustice" for all those who have been so-called "wronged" and "struggled," although they put on a hypocritical face of "compassion," the class stand hidden behind them, that is, the reactionary class nature of representing the interests of the rightist group to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, has actually been completely exposed. It is precisely because the reactionary class stand of the rightists is very firm, so they actually take an extremely hostile attitude towards the victory of the Party, the government, and the people's purge policy. They know very well that the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the elimination of all remaining counter-revolutionary elements actually means the destruction of the social foundation for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, we can say that the main purpose of the rightists' attempt to negate the achievements of the purge and advocate a comprehensive "rehabilitation" is to protect the class interests represented by a few rightists to oppose the Party, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, and attempt to replace it with bourgeois democracy and bourgeois dictatorship. Therefore, we cannot look at the rightists' attempt to negate the achievements of the purge and propose the "rehabilitation committee" in isolation. In fact, it is also one of the many absurd proposals in the political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance, such as the "political design institute" and the so-called "bicameral system," the rotation of power by various democratic parties, and the abolition of the school party committee system.

**The Main Tendency in Our Thinking at Present Is Not That We Have Struck Too Much Against the Enemy, but That We Have Not Struck Enough Against the Enemy Due to Laxity and Complacency**

Finally, I would also like to briefly talk about the current situation of enemy activities. Sichuan is the same as other parts of the country. Although the three major transformations have been basically completed and the exploitation system has been basically eliminated, all remaining counter-revolutionary elements, after several purge movements, although the estimate that his main force has been basically eliminated is correct, this does not mean that there are no counter-revolutionaries. According to the recent situation in various regions, whether in urban or rural areas, the enemy's sabotage activities are still constantly occurring. For example, in Lidong Township, Muchuan County, not long after the purge movement last year, several counter-revolutionary elements colluded with more than ten people to organize the "Big Knife Society," launched a riot, invaded the Wumapin Farm, killed two cadres, and killed and wounded more than 30 cadres and masses and burned dozens of houses in Lidong Township. Tao Fazhao, a counter-revolutionary element in Wushan County, colluded with his brother and beat Tao Huida's family of four to death. This spring, Jinlong Township, Zitong County, also cracked a case in which counter-revolutionary element Tu Nanting colluded with more than 400 people to conspire to organize a riot,妄想打到北京来当“皇帝”案 [plotting to attack Beijing to become "emperor"]. At present, some areas have also discovered the restoration activities of reactionary secret societies, criminal activities have also increased, and special agents and newly emerging counter-revolutionary elements have also been discovered. In particular, since the rectification movement, counter-revolutionary elements who have survived the purge in various places, as well as some landlords and rich peasants who have not been reformed, are also using the opportunity of speaking freely to carry out rumors and sabotage, and in rural areas, individual reactionary landlords have begun to settle accounts with the peasants and attempt to recover the distributed land. In view of the above-mentioned activities of the enemy, it not only proves that the past purge movement was completely necessary, but also proves that since the completion of the three major transformations last year, although the contradictions among the people have become prominent, we must never lose vigilance against the enemy's activities and sabotage because of this. The main tendency in our thinking at present is not that we have struck enough against the enemy, but that we have not struck enough against the enemy due to laxity and complacency. According to the above situation, I believe that in the current purge work, we must seriously pay attention to solving the following two aspects of the problem: first, the principle of "all counter-revolutionaries must be purged" must be adhered to and implemented, and we must never relax our struggle against the enemy because we want to deal with the contradictions among the people, especially some extremely cunning enemies who use the contradictions among the people to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, we must be good at distinguishing them and accurately strike at them. Second, in order to better consolidate the achievements of the purge movement, through the rectification and inspection work, in particular, we must respond to and implement Chairman Mao's instructions in his speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Council on February 27, that the purge work should be carried out once every one or two years. A major inspection. Thoroughly exposing some of the shortcomings and deviations in our work through major inspections is beneficial to better implement the principle of "all mistakes must be corrected," and we must resolutely implement it.

Fellow delegates, the victory of the Five-Anti Movement paved the way for the three major transformations. The purge movement is a major component of the socialist revolution. It is inconceivable that without the great victory of the purge movement, the three major transformations could be smoothly completed and socialist construction could be carried out. The rightists today are using the purge issue to attack the Party and the people, attempting to achieve their goal of shaking the achievements of the revolutionary movement, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship, and opposing the socialist revolution and socialist construction. This is absolutely impossible. At present, the rightists' conspiracies against the Party, the people, and socialism have been fully exposed, and the people of the whole country are united as one to resolutely fight against the rightists. We must take advantage of the victory and pursue the enemy, and we will never withdraw our troops until we win a complete victory. I believe that victory belongs to the people. Thoroughly smashing the rightists' conspiracies and clearing these obstacles on the road ahead, socialist construction will advance more vigorously!

    不许右派推翻肃反成果
    谷志标谈四川省的肃反工作
    周总理的政府工作报告及其他几项报告我完全拥护。我现在就四川省的肃反工作发表一些意见。
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话及周总理报告中对我国肃反运动所作出的总结性的论断，从四川的肃反工作看，是完全正确而符合于实际情况的。
    肃反工作大大纯洁了革命组织，成绩是巨大的
    自一九五五年秋开始，四川在全省范围内开展了大规模的肃清反革命分子运动，斗争的发展基本上是正常的、健康的，获得了巨大的成绩。我们肃反的巨大成绩主要表现在什么地方呢？首先是查出了一大批反革命分子和其他坏分子。截至一九五七年四月止，全省清查出来已经最后定案的反革命分子和坏分子共五千三百多名。同时，在去年开展的政治攻势中，至十二月底，据不完全统计，全省投案自首的反革命分子和其他刑事犯罪分子有一万多人。在查出的一大批反革命分子中，有一批是隐藏较深，血债累累，罪恶和民愤极大的。如在重庆航运部门中查出来的职业特务夏惠中，是双手沾满鲜血的“上饶集中营”的“夏区队长”。成都查出的陆刚，是贵州盘县长期通缉在案的匪“中国反共抗俄同盟军滇桂黔纵队”大队长。平武县卫生院潜藏着的一个重大反革命分子，是蒋匪委任的青海“绥靖司令”，这次才被查了出来。特别值得注意的是在查获的这批反革命分子中，有些已混入共产党内或共青团内，有的且已窃据了领导职位。如曾任简阳县人民检察院检察长、中共简阳县委委员、监委书记等职的雷丕荣，原来是一个在一九三七年即残杀过农民的惯匪。又如一九五二年即任中共荣县县委组织部副部长的李会坊，这次查清了原来是一个在抗日战争时期曾出卖了五个党员、为日寇搜集我八路军情报的叛徒、汉奸。经过肃反运动，把这一大批穷凶极恶的暗藏的敌人清查出来，大大纯洁了革命组织，同时教育了广大群众，提高了他们的社会主义觉悟与政治警惕，划清了敌我界限。这不仅进一步巩固了人民民主专政，而且大大推进了社会主义革命事业的发展。
    一九五五年秋开展的大规模的肃反运动是在什么样的情况下来进行的呢？它是在五大运动取得胜利、社会主义革命高潮即将到来的前夕的情况下进行的。即是说，过去的五大运动，特别是过去的社会镇反运动，虽然曾经直接给了反革命分子以严重打击，但不少隐藏较深的反革命分子是漏了网的。而这一批反革命分子眼看中国革命就快进入社会主义革命高潮的时候，他们为着进行其垂死前的挣扎，于是从各方面来进行疯狂破坏。因此，当时的情况是面临着这样的一种课题，就是必须彻底解决敌我矛盾，打击和粉碎敌人的破坏活动，为三大改造铺平道路，为顺利地推进和完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设奠定基础。因此，一九五五年秋开展起来的肃反运动，实际是以粉碎胡风反革命集团的猖狂进攻为开端，从而在全国范围内开展了一次肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的运动。这是一场严重的解决敌我矛盾的阶级斗争。运动是以人民获得了巨大胜利，反革命分子的主要力量被基本肃清而结束。
    如上所述，四川的肃反运动和全国其他省区一样，获得了巨大成绩，但也发生了一些缺点和偏差。主要表现在以下两个方面：一方面是有个别斗争过火的情况，即是捕了某些可捕可不捕或完全不应该捕的；另方面，也有应捕应判应关而却未捕未判未关的。必须指出：以上这种缺点和偏差的发生，虽然严格地从肃反工作要求讲是有损失的，但总的说来，成绩是非常巨大的。而且关于前一种性质的缺点和偏差，有的在发现后即已及时作了纠正，特别是经过去年的大检查，绝大多数存在问题的案件都已作了处理，或继续在复查处理。后一种性质的缺点和偏差，只要我们不麻痹大意，一些漏网的反革命分子，终究是逃不出人民法网的。总的说来，成绩是主要的、巨大的。这一事实是无容置疑和无容否认的。可是，我们对于中国肃反运动成绩是主要的、基本的这一实事求是的结论，是否能与少数右派分子如章伯钧、罗隆基及其在四川的代理人潘大逵等在看法上取得一致呢？从过去，特别是从最近一个多月来，在四川所揭发出来的右派分子的思想言行看，却得出了两种完全相反的看法和相反的结论。这种不同的看法和不同的结论表现在那些地方呢？
    以潘大逵为首的四川右派分子要为历次运动中受“冤屈”的人“平反”，打击过去肃反运动中的积极分子，形成所谓社会舆论压力，企图孤立党和损害党在群众中的威信
    首先是我们认为我们几年来的肃反成绩是主要的、巨大的，而潘大逵等右派分子们则认为搞糟了、搞错了，不知错捕、错关、错杀了多少人，因而他们认为肃反工作中的错误与偏差是主要的，而且是带全国性的。如罗隆基在成都视察工作时即曾对潘大逵、范朴斋等说过“胡风案件搞错了，胡风并不是反革命”等话。罗隆基这样的看法，潘大逵、范朴斋等是同意的。四川省民盟常务委员韩文畦同样在指责和诬蔑我们肃反工作的许多作法是“违反”宪法的。如他说历次运动都是凭一部分有权力者的“大胆怀疑”、“随心认定”，而对
  “自己不相信的公民”（包括反革命在内）擅行扣押、侮辱，侵犯人身自由。“只有一部分拥有特殊权力、可以疑人而不受疑的人，才能免于这种惶恐”。因此，他们要求对肃反运动的成绩“应作重新估计”。
    其次是我们认为肃反运动之所以搞得比较彻底和能够获得巨大的成绩，主要是采取了在党和政府的统一领导下，将公安、检察、法院等业务部门同发动群众、依靠群众的群众路线相结合。而这一路线之所以比较正确，在运动发展中少发生偏差，这不是中国共产党和中国人民的特别聪明，而主要是他总结和发展了中国近几十年来革命斗争中的肃反经验。但潘大逵等右派分子，则认为党领导肃反工作是不合法的，对肃反运动和肃反工作中的群众路线，他们也是反对的。而且有的人认为肃反工作之所以容易发生偏差和错误，主要是由于群众“无知”（意指没有法律知识，有的人认为“干部没有相当文化基础，不能分别好人坏人”）和易于发生“偏激”的情况所造成的。而他们的所谓偏差和错误，不仅是认为某些群众性的斗争“过火”了，“扩大化”了，而且把群众性的小组说理批判、小组思想检讨等看成是“私设公堂”，或把群众为了防止发生意外，对于被批判的人进行善意的临时性的陪同居住叫做是“私设监狱”。这种种恶毒的诽谤和造谣的目的，不仅在于企图使肃反运动离开群众的依靠和党的领导，使运动展开困难，斗争无力，不能准确、有力地打击敌人，而且也在诬蔑群众，诬蔑党，并企图挑拨党与群众、党和政府等三者互相之间的正常关系。右派分子这种用意是十分险恶的，我们决不要上当。
    再次是对于肃反工作中的某些缺点和偏差，我们曾经是一再的肯定要进行复查纠正，而事实上也是完全本着党和政府“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，并通过有关部门进行不断的检查和纠正的。而且特别是经过去年对肃反工作进行了全面大检查之后，过去肃反工作中所存在的问题，已经基本上获得解决。但右派分子对于这一问题的看法怎样呢？他们是完全处于恶毒反对者的地位。他们不但不相信党和政府能“有错必纠”，而且他们既认定肃反工作中的缺点和偏差是主要的，那么他们的另一个阴谋诡计，即关于组织“平反委员会”的问题，就必然要随着提出来。四川右派分子潘大逵把罗隆基所设计的“平反委员会”在四川翻版，而且更有创造性地把“平反”的范围扩大了，他不仅主张要为一九五五年在机关肃反工作中所谓被“冤屈”了的人“平反”，而且主张对于在“三反”、“五反”及历次运动中所谓被“冤屈”、被打击和被斗争错了的人都要“平反”；他不仅主张对活的人要“平反”，而且对于死了的也要“平反”；不仅对于被镇压者要“平反”，而且对于畏罪自杀者也要“平反”。以潘大逵为首的四川民盟中的右派分子们，为着要达到其否定成绩，并促其“平反委员会”组织的实现，潘大逵是非常羡慕和称赞黄绍竑在浙江检查肃反工作中否定成绩、扩大缺点的办法，而且决心要效法他，也要在四川检查出有关肃反工作的严重错误来。特别是潘大逵等认为否定肃反成绩的时机已经成熟，于是他们就趁着党号召党外人士帮助党整风的机会大放厥词，以正确处理人民内部矛盾问题为借口，来掩盖他们反对过去我们解决敌我矛盾的种种措施。在这个企图下，他们布置了一套所谓“摘帽子”“解围”“保险”等口号；并采取个别访问、请客吃饭和召开座谈会等方式来专门发动对党对政府有意见的人进行大鸣大放，并把他们不满的意见汇集起来，传扬出去；同时发动这些人起哄，用种种手段孤立、打击过去肃反运动中的积极分子，形成所谓社会舆论的压力，来企图孤立党和损害党在群众中的威信，并达到潘大逵所谓“平反机构一定要成立”的目的。罗隆基在四川民盟中的一些心腹，专门在各大专学校收集了这一类性质的“检举”和“控告”信一百多件，这就是他在党中央统战部座谈会上所提出来的组织“平反委员会”的依据的一部分。而在最近所揭发出来的四川民盟右派分子的赵一明、舒军和李康等人反党反社会主义的材料，就是根据罗隆基、潘大逵等这种意图来部署工作和进行工作的。
    右派分子的目的是保护少数右派分子所代表的阶级利益，来反对人民民主专政，企图代之以资产阶级的民主和专政
    以上种种，就是四川右派分子同我们对于肃反问题的一些完全不同和对立的看法。为什么有这两种不同的看法呢？同时右派分子企图抹煞事实，夸大缺点，否定成绩，反对肃反运动中党的领导和群众路线，以及主张成立“平反委员会”的目的和意图又是些什么呢？很显然，任何思想、主张与言行，都是一定阶级立场和阶级观点的反映。全国广大工人、农民、知识分子、工商业者和一切爱国人士之所以积极赞成和拥护党与政府肃清一切反革命分子的政策，并实事求是地承认肃反成绩的巨大，主要是因为他们过去曾经长期受过地主、官僚和特务反革命分子的严重压榨摧残与迫害，所以他们能够明确地站稳无产阶级和人民的立场，同一切违反人民利益的思想言行作斗争。斗争的目的也是非常明确的，即主要是为了保卫人民革命的果实，巩固人民民主专政和保卫社会主义建设的利益。资产阶级右派分子之所以要否定肃反成绩，夸大缺点，并要为所有所谓被“冤屈”被“斗争”的人“鸣不平”，虽然他们在表面上装起一付“悲天悯人”的伪君子面貌，但是他们背后所隐藏的阶级立场，即代表右派集团利益来进行反党反人民和反社会主义的反动阶级本质，实际上已经完全暴露出来了。正是由于右派分子们的反动的阶级立场是站得非常稳的，因而他们对于党、政府和人民的肃反政策的胜利，实际是采取极端仇视的态度的。他们很清楚地知道人民民主专政的日益巩固和一切残余反革命分子的被肃清，实际是意味着资本主义复辟的社会基础的被毁灭。因此我们可以这样说，右派分子们的企图否定肃反成绩，并主张进行全面“平反”的目的，主要在于保护少数右派分子所代表的阶级利益来反对党、反对人民民主专政，企图代之以资产阶级的民主和资产阶级的专政。因此我们对于右派分子企图否定肃反成绩和提出“平反委员会”的主张，不能把它孤立起来看，实际也就是章罗联盟的政治纲领中所提出的“政治设计院”以及所谓“两院制”、各民主党派轮流执政和取消学校党委制等的许多荒谬主张的组成部分之一。
    目前我们思想上存在的主要倾向，不是对于敌人打击得多了，而是由于松懈麻痹，对敌人打击得不够
    最后，我还要简单谈一谈目前敌人活动的情况。我们四川也同全国各地一样，三大改造虽然已经基本完成，剥削制度已经基本消灭，所有残余反革命分子，在经过几次肃反运动之后，虽然他的主要力量已经基本被肃清的估计是正确的，但是这不等于没有反革命了。根据最近各个地区的情况看，无论在城市或农村，敌人的破坏活动仍是在不断发生着。如去年沐川县利店乡在肃反运动后不久，就有几个反革命分子纠合十余人组织“大刀会”，发动暴乱，侵入五马坪农场，杀死两个干部，并在利店乡杀死杀伤干部、群众三十多人，烧毁房屋数十间。巫山县反革命分子陶发藻伙同其弟，把检举过他的陶惠达全家四口活活打死。今年春天梓潼县金龙乡还破获了反革命分子涂南亭纠合四百余人阴谋组织暴乱，妄想打到北京来当“皇帝”案。目前有些地区又发现反动会道门的复辟活动，刑事犯罪活动亦有增加，派遣特务和新出现的反革命分子也有所发现。特别是自整风运动以来，各地漏网残存的反革命分子，以及部分未获得改造的地主富农分子，也在利用大鸣大放的机会来进行造谣破坏，农村中且有个别反动地主开始向农民进行倒算和企图收回已分的土地。鉴于敌人以上的种种活动，不仅证明了过去的肃反运动完全是必要的，而且也证明了自去年三大改造完成之后，虽然人民内部矛盾突出来了，但是绝不能因此而对敌人的活动与破坏丧失警惕。目前在我们思想上存在的主要倾向，不是对于敌人打击得够了，而是由于松懈麻痹，对敌人打击得不够。根据以上情况，我认为在目前肃反工作中，必须认真地注意解决以下两方面的问题：第一是“有反必肃”的方针必须坚持与贯彻，绝不能因为要处理人民内部矛盾而放松了对敌人的斗争，特别是某些利用人民内部矛盾出现，而实际是进行反革命活动的极其狡猾的敌人，更要善于区别，而加以准确的打击。第二是为了更好地巩固肃反运动的成绩，通过整风检查工作，特别是我们必须响应和执行毛主席二月二十七日在最高国务会议关于正确处理人民内部矛盾讲话中有关肃反工作，应在一、二年内进行一次大检查的指示。通过大检查深入一步地揭露我们工作中的一些缺点和偏差，这对于更好地贯彻“有错必纠”的方针是有利的，我们必须坚决地加以贯彻的。
    各位代表，五大运动的胜利，为三大改造铺平了道路。肃反运动是社会主义革命的一个主要组成部分。不能设想，没有肃反运动的巨大胜利而能够顺利完成三大改造和进行社会主义建设。右派分子今天利用肃反问题来向党向人民进行攻击，企图达到他们动摇革命运动成果、反对人民民主专政、反对社会主义革命和社会主义建设的目的，这是绝不可能的。目前，右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋已经大暴露，全国人民同仇敌忾，坚决向右派分子进行斗争，我们必须乘胜追击，不获全胜决不收兵。我相信，胜利是属于人民的。彻底粉碎了右派分子的阴谋，扫清这些前进道路上的障碍，社会主义建设就将更加大踏步的前进！
