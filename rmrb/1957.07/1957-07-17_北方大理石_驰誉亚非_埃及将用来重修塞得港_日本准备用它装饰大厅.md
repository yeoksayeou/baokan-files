    "Northern Marble" Famous in Asia and Africa
    Egypt to Use it to Rebuild Port Said
    Japan to Use it to Decorate Hall
    (Our Newspaper News) The Liaoning Daily reports: Egypt will use "Northern Marble" produced in Liaoning and Hebei provinces to rebuild Port Said and Cairo. The China Minerals Company has decided to sell more than 8,000 square meters of marble to Egypt starting in the third quarter. More than 600 square meters will be loaded for export in July.
    In addition to Dali County in Yunnan Province, which produces famous marble, Liaoning and Hebei provinces also produce this stone, which is called "Northern Marble." It has the same beautiful, smooth, and solid characteristics as Yunnan marble, and it is also larger in size than Yunnan marble. It can be used to make wall panels, floors, columns, and stair steps for large buildings. It is a noble building material. The "Northern Marble" produced in Liaoning Province comes in two types: one is "Northeast Green" produced in the suburbs of Benxi City, which was used to decorate the large columns in the Soviet Exhibition Hall in Beijing; the other is "Northeast Red" produced in Jin County.
    Now, this "Northern Marble" has aroused the interest of many Asian and African countries. In addition to Egypt, Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan is preparing to use "Northeast Green" to decorate the hall of a building it claims will be "unprecedented" in Tokyo. Shinyei Kaisha of Japan has already purchased a batch of "Sunset Glow" marble produced in Hebei Province, which will be loaded for export in July. Singapore Forest Co., Ltd. has signed an agreement with China Minerals Company and is willing to act as a distributor for China's marble.

    “北方大理石”驰誉亚非
    埃及将用来重修塞得港
    日本准备用它装饰大厅
    本报讯　辽宁日报消息：埃及将用我国辽宁、河北两省出产的“北方大理石”重修塞得港和开罗。中国矿产公司决定从第三季度起，先将八千多平方公尺大理石销往埃及，7月份就可装船出口六百多平方公尺。
    我国除云南省的大理县出产著名的大理石以外，在辽宁、河北两省也出产这种石头，人们称为“北方大理石”。它具有云南大理石同样的美观、滑润、坚固的特点，而且比云南大理石块大，可以做大建筑物的墙板、地板、圆柱和楼梯台阶，是一种高贵的建筑材料。辽宁省出产的“北方大理石”有两种，一种是本溪市郊所产的“东北绿”，曾用来装饰北京苏联展览馆中的大圆柱；另一种是金县出产的“东北红”。
    现在，这种“北方大理石”已经引起许多亚非国家的兴趣。除埃及外，日本三菱商事株式会社要在东京建筑一所自称为“空前未有”的大楼，也准备用“东北绿”装饰大厅。日本神荣生丝株式会社已买妥了一批河北省出产的晚霞大理石，在7月份就可装船出口。新加坡森林有限公司已经同中国矿产公司签订协议，愿意代销我国大理石。
