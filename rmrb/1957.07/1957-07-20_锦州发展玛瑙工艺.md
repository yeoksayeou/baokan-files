Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 18th: Jinzhou agate, famous throughout the country, will be developed to its highest level of two hundred years ago within five years. The Jinzhou Municipal Handicraft Management Department has already made a plan for the development of agate craftsmanship.

In the Jinzhou Agate Production Cooperative, the reporter saw all kinds of hard, round, crystal clear and lovely agate products - cigarette holders, phonograph needles, fountain pen nibs, umbrella handles, clothing buttons, watch chains, grapes, pomegranates, etc. Usually, people's impression of pearls and agate is that they are valuable works of art for appreciation. They did not expect that the artists would use agate to make daily necessities and cultural products such as phonograph needles, carbon paper nibs, and fountain pen nibs. The director of the cooperative told reporters that they also made "yarn clearer boards" used on textile machines, "burnishing stones" used in the leather industry, and "knife edges" used on balances. The yarn clearer boards used by the Jinzhou Textile Factory in the past were made of glass and had to be replaced every week, and often caused yarn breakage. The yarn clearer board made of agate has been in good condition for four months and does not break the yarn, improving product quality.

    锦州发展玛瑙工艺
    据新华社锦州18日讯  驰名全国的锦州玛瑙，五年内将发展到二百年前的最高水平。锦州市手工业管理部门已作出了发展玛瑙工艺的规划。
    在锦州玛瑙生产合作社里，记者看到了各种坚硬、圆润、晶莹可爱的玛瑙制品——烟嘴、唱针、自来水笔尖、伞把、衣扣、表链、葡萄、石榴等。平时人们对珍珠、玛瑙的印象是供欣赏的贵重艺术品，没有想到艺人们却用玛瑙制作了像唱针、复写笔尖、自来水笔尖等日用品和文化用品。社主任对记者说，他们还制作了纺织机上用的“清纱板”，制革工业上用的“赶光石”和天平上用的“称刀”等。锦州纺织厂过去使用的清纱板是玻璃做的，每周要换一次，而且经常造成断纱现象。用玛瑙制作的清纱板使用了四个月还完好如初，并且不断纱，提高了产品质量。
