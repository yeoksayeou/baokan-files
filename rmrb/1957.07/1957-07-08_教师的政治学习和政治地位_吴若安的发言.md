Teachers' Political Study and Political Status
    Wu Ruo'an's Speech
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report the great achievements our country has made in promoting literacy and universal education since liberation: the number of primary school students in school has increased from more than 24 million in 1949 to more than 63 million in 1956; from 1949 to 1956, more than 22 million people across the country were freed from illiteracy; and from 1951 to 1957, the state invested nearly 4.9 billion yuan in popular education, accounting for more than 24 percent of all cultural and educational expenditures and more than 54 percent of all ordinary education expenditures. In just seven or eight years since liberation, the rapid development of popular education and ordinary education in our country has greatly improved the cultural life of the people throughout the country. This is unprecedented in the history of Chinese education, and this is an earth-shaking change in Chinese history. Looking back at the old China before liberation, what was the state of popular education under decades of reactionary rule? Wasn't it just natural disasters and man-made calamities, with people struggling to survive, let alone talk about popular education? Even if there were some primary and secondary schools, they were all monopolized by the reactionary ruling class, used to train the children of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and cultivate talents to serve the reactionary ruling class. It was an education of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature. This is completely different from the popular education after liberation, where the people are masters of their own affairs, education serves the workers and peasants, and the children of the working people are trained to become laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and healthy bodies. Not only is the class nature of education completely different, but also the development of education is something that old China could not have dreamed of in decades, even hundreds or thousands of years. The brilliant achievements of popular education in our country in recent years precisely illustrate the great superiority of the socialist system. This is entirely due to the correct and wise leadership of the working class and the great Communist Party of China. The bourgeois right-wingers and all right-wing elements groundlessly slander and denigrate the great achievements of our country in recent years, arbitrarily distorting and exaggerating the new China's education into being "terrible" and "chaotic," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. They even attempt to weaken the leadership of the Party and are deliberately trying to drag the new China back to the old China. We absolutely cannot tolerate this and must resolutely criticize and strike back. We do not deny that there are some shortcomings and deviations in education work, but these are unavoidable difficulties in the process of great socialist construction. We must first affirm that achievements are the main thing, affirm the great achievements that our ancestors have not made, and then, in order to achieve even greater achievements in the future, we must resolutely overcome the existing shortcomings. Therefore, we must sincerely and realistically help the Party in its rectification campaign to strengthen the Party's leadership, consolidate the unity between the Party and the people, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and further build the great cause of socialism even better. We should recognize that only the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party of China can enable the motherland to continuously produce historical miracles. No other class or party will be able to do this, nor is it possible to do so. Only the Communist Party of China can lead the people of the whole country to march towards the road of socialism and communism!
    Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held 20 to 30 forums in a row, inviting administrative cadres and teachers from primary and secondary schools, normal schools, spare-time education, kindergartens, schools for the deaf and mute, and literacy education units to give their opinions on the above-mentioned educational work. After the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference was held, the Education Bureau invited teachers who participated in the Propaganda Work Conference to hold a forum. The teacher comrades actively put forward their opinions and criticisms, most of which were sincere and well-intentioned, and were of great help to the Education Bureau in improving its work and considering future measures. In the spirit of learning, releasing, and rectifying at the same time, the Education Bureau has conducted preliminary research based on the opinions and criticisms put forward by the teachers, and has proposed several improvement plans, including: the issue of middle school affairs committees, the issue of teacher training, the issue of school personnel establishment and overcoming busyness, the issue of spare-time schools, and the issue of employee welfare. At present, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is inviting people from all walks of life to conduct group discussions and research in order to make these plans more perfect, more practical, and better able to give play to the enthusiasm of school staff, in order to promote the cause of people's education.
    Intellectuals must undergo a complete transformation and thoroughly reform their ideology
    Here, I would like to talk about my personal opinions on two issues:
    First, on the issue of teachers' political study. After studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and comparing it with the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies that have emerged in the recent month of blooming and contending, I deeply realize that the ideological remolding of intellectuals is still a very urgent and important task in this period of great change. In the seven years since liberation, Chinese intellectuals have made some progress through various movements and studies. They have personally experienced the superiority of the socialist system, thereby supporting the Party and willing to serve the socialist cause. However, I deeply feel that it is a rather arduous task for intellectuals to change their world outlook and fundamentally establish a proletarian stand. Many intellectuals, although they support the Party and approve of socialism in their basic attitude, on the other hand, they cannot forget the bourgeois old democratic ideas, and cannot forget the various demands of bourgeois individualism and fame and status. Because of this, the important issue of "how to adapt to the needs of the new society" arises, as Chairman Mao pointed out in his report. Chairman Mao taught us: "Although there has been progress, we should not be complacent because of this." I understand that this is because our intellectuals have not yet established a new world outlook, so their thoughts and feelings cannot be combined with the workers and peasants, and cannot fully meet the requirements of socialism. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen ideological remolding, we must exercise in practice, and we must put in a complete transformation, which cannot be done simply by reading a few theoretical books. Some comrades among us do not have a sufficient understanding of this point, so they relax their political study and the tempering of their thoughts and feelings. Such comrades often lack a spirit of revolutionary optimism and the confidence to overcome difficulties and forge ahead in their work. This is still in the normal state. If they encounter huge changes and sharp struggles, such as the current struggle against right-wing ambitious elements, some people's understanding becomes blurred, ideological confusion arises, and even their positions waver, not knowing where to go. Such a situation is certainly not in the minority among intellectuals, but it is no exception among primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai. This places a certain responsibility on me personally, as one of the persons in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. In the past few years, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has done some work in conducting political and ideological education for teachers, but it has not done enough, especially the regular and systematic political theory education work has not been done enough. In the past year or two, this aspect has been relatively relaxed, and only business has been unilaterally emphasized, and it has not been noticed that business cannot be done well if it is separated from political ideology. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul." He also pointed out that "ideological and political work should be the responsibility of all departments." This is a great education for me personally, so I think that in the future, in addition to strengthening political study and ideological remolding personally, I should also fulfill my responsibilities in my work and do a good job in the political study and ideological work of teachers in Shanghai.
    Strengthen social propaganda to change the phenomenon of belittling teachers
    Second, on the issue of the social status of primary and secondary school teachers. Primary and secondary school teachers shoulder the important task of cultivating the next generation of the motherland. It is entirely appropriate to compare them to the "soul engineers" of the motherland. However, only seven or eight years have passed since liberation, and the phenomenon of belittling teachers left over from the old society has already changed greatly. Although the Party and the government have repeatedly publicized to society and have actually given teachers great care and respect, some people in society have not completely changed their attitude of belittling teachers. In Shanghai, there have been incidents of parents scolding teachers and even beating teachers. Of course, beating teachers is a very individual example, but the phenomenon of belittling teachers to varying degrees still exists. In this "blooming" and "contending," many teachers, especially primary school teachers, have mentioned the issue of teachers' social status, believing that some people in society have not yet well understood the Party and the government's attention and care for teachers, and therefore have not created a social atmosphere of respecting teachers. This requires further strengthening social propaganda work in order to completely change the phenomenon of belittling teachers in society, otherwise it will be detrimental to the development of education; at the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the professional ideological education of in-service teachers and normal school students in order to encourage young people to actively apply for normal schools and normal colleges in the future.
    I have talked about this issue many times in my speeches to teachers and students in Shanghai, especially students in normal schools. Now I raise this issue again, the purpose is to hope that people from all walks of life can publicize it more to society. The Party and the government have already done a lot of work in this regard, and of course they will continue to do so in the future. If we can get assistance from people from all walks of life to do some publicity work for the government and create a new atmosphere of respecting teachers in society, then it will be of great help to the socialist education construction of the motherland.
    Finally, I express that in order to safeguard the socialist cause of the motherland, support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and strengthen the unity of the people throughout the country, we must actively participate in the struggle against the right-wingers and resolutely give the right-wing elements a merciless blow, so that our great cause of socialism can move forward more smoothly!

    教师的政治学习和政治地位
    吴若安的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。周总理在报告中指出了我国解放以来在推行扫盲和普及教育的伟大成就：在校小学生已从一九四九年的二千四百多万人增加到一九五六年的六千三百多万人，从一九四九年到一九五六年全国扫除文盲二千二百多万人，从一九五一年到一九五七年国家用于普及教育的经费将近四十九亿元，占全部文教经费的百分之二十四强，占全部普通教育经费的百分之五十四强。解放以来，不过七、八年，我国人民普及教育、普通教育发展这样迅速，使全国人民文化生活有了很大的改善，这是中国教育史上所没有的，这是中国历史上天翻地复的变化。回顾解放以前的旧中国几十年在反动统治下的普及教育是怎样的呢？那还不是天灾人祸，民不聊生，人民救死尚且不暇，何况谈到普及教育。即使有一些中小学，也尽是为反动统治阶级所垄断，作为训练地主、资产阶级的子弟，培养为反动统治阶级服务的人才，是一种半封建半殖民地性质的教育。这和解放以后人民当家作主的普及教育，把教育来为工农服务，把劳动人民子弟培养成有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者的教育，是完全不可同日而语的。不但教育的阶级性质完全不同，而且在教育事业的发展上，也是旧中国几十年乃至于几百年、几千年所梦想不到的。几年来我国普及教育所以能得到这样辉煌的成就，这正说明社会主义制度的莫大优越性。这完全是由于工人阶级和伟大的中国共产党的正确而英明的领导。资产阶级右派野心家及一切右派分子，无端诽谤诬蔑我国几年来的伟大成就，把新中国教育事业任意歪曲夸大成为“糟得很”、“乱得很”是完全不符合事实的。甚至企图削弱党的领导，别有用心地想把新中国拖到旧中国的老路上去。我们完全不能容忍，必须坚决的给予批驳和痛击。我们不否认在教育工作上有某些缺点和偏差，但这是在伟大的社会主义建设的进程中不可避免的困难。我们首先要肯定成绩是主要的，肯定我们祖先没有做过的伟大成就，然后为了要使今后获得更大的成绩，就要坚决克服存在的缺点。因此就要诚心诚意、实事求是地帮助党整风，以求加强党的领导，巩固党和人民的团结，巩固人民民主专政，进一步把社会主义伟大事业建设得更好。我们应该认识，只有工人阶级和中国共产党的领导，才能使祖国不断产生历史奇迹。任何阶级和政党都不会做到，也不可能做到。只有中国共产党才能领导全国人民向社会主义、共产主义的道路迈进！
    上一个月，我们上海市教育局连续召开二、三十次座谈会，邀请了中小学、师范、业余进修、幼儿、聋哑、扫盲教育等单位的行政干部和教师们就以上各种教育工作提意见。在上海宣传工作会议召开以后，教育局又邀请了参加宣传工作会议的教师们举行座谈。教师同志们积极地提出了意见和批评，绝大多数都是诚恳的、善意的，对教育局改进工作和考虑今后措施是有很大帮助的。教育局本着边学、边放、边改的精神，已经根据教师们提出的意见和批评，进行了初步研究，提出了几个改进方案，包括：中学校务委员会问题，教师进修问题，学校人事编制与克服忙乱问题，业余学校问题，教职员福利问题。目前上海市教育局正在邀请各方面人士分组进行讨论研究，以便使这些方案订得更完善、更切合实际、更能发挥学校工作人员的积极性，以求有利于人民教育事业的推进。
    知识分子要下个脱胎换骨的工夫，彻底进行思想改造
    这里我想就两个问题谈谈个人的意见：
    第一，关于教师的政治学习问题。学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲演，对照一下近一月来在鸣放中出现的反党、反社会主义的谬论，我深切地体会到，知识分子的思想改造，在这一个大变动的时期中还是一项十分迫切重要的工作。解放七年多来，我国知识分子经过各种运动和学习，他们大多数都有了一些进步，切身地体会到社会主义制度的优越性，从而拥护党、愿意为社会主义事业服务。可是，我深深地感觉到，知识分子要改变世界观从根本上确立无产阶级立场，却是一件相当艰巨的事。许多知识分子，虽然在基本态度上是拥护党、赞成社会主义的，但另一方面，他们还不能忘情于资产阶级旧民主主义思想，不能忘怀于资产阶级个人主义名位观念的种种要求，因为这样，就发生了如毛主席在报告中所指出的，“如何适应新社会的需要”的重要问题。毛主席教导我们：“虽然已经有了进步，但是不应当因此自满”。我体会，这就是因为我们知识分子还没有确立新的世界观，所以思想感情还不能和工人农民结合起来，还不能完全符合社会主义的要求。因此我们要继续加强思想改造，要在实践中锻炼，更要下一个脱胎换骨的工夫，而不仅仅是读了几本理论书籍就能办到。我们当中有些同志对这一点没有足够的认识，所以就放松了自己的政治学习和思想感情的锻炼，这样的同志在工作中就往往缺乏一种革命乐观主义精神和战胜困难、勇往直前的信心。这还是就平常状态而言，如果就碰到巨大的变革，尖锐的斗争，例如当前所开展的反右派野心分子的斗争，有些人的认识就模糊起来，也产生了思想混乱，甚至连立场也动摇起来，不知何去何从？这样的情况，在知识分子当中当然还不是少数，但在上海中小学教师当中也并不例外。这对我个人，作为上海市教育局的负责人之一，更要负一定的责任。几年来，上海市教育局在对教师进行政治思想教育方面，虽然也做了一些工作，但做得十分不够，特别是经常的、系统的政治理论教育工作做得很不够。近一两年来，这方面比较放松，只是片面地强调了业务，没有注意到业务脱离了政治思想那就连业务也不可能搞好。毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”又指出，“思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。”这对我个人是很大的教育，因而我想到，今后除了个人应当加强政治学习、加强思想改造之外，还应当在工作岗位上克尽职责，把上海的教师的政治学习和思想工作做好。
    加强社会宣传改变轻视教师的现象
    第二，关于中小学教师的社会地位问题。中小学教师担负着培养祖国下一代的重要任务。把他们比喻为祖国的“灵魂工程师”是完全恰当的。但是解放才不过七、八年，旧社会遗留下来的轻视教师的现象，虽然已经有了很大的改变，党和政府虽然一再向社会宣传并在实际上给予教师以极大的关怀和尊重，但社会上还有些人没有彻底改变轻视教师的态度。在上海曾经发生过家长辱骂教师，甚至殴打教师的事情。殴打教师当然是极个别的例子，但不同程度的轻视教师的现象，还是存在的。在这一次“鸣”“放”中，不少教师特别是小学教师提到了教师的社会地位问题，认为社会上有些人对党和政府重视和关怀教师的实际还没有很好体会，因而还没有造成尊重教师的社会风气。这就要求需要进一步加强社会宣传工作，以便彻底改变社会上轻视教师的现象，否则对教育事业的发展是不利的；同时也要加强在职教师和在校师范生的专业思想教育，以求今后升学青年踊跃愿意投考师范学校和师范学院。
    我在上海对教师和学生、特别是师范院校的学生讲话中，多次谈过这个问题，现在我再一次提出这个问题，目的在于希望各方面人士能多向社会宣传。党和政府在这方面已经做了不少工作，今后当然还继续做，如果获得各方面社会人士多方协助政府做些宣传工作，造成社会上尊重教师的新风气，那么，对于祖国社会主义教育建设就有很大帮助。
    最后，我表示为了维护祖国社会主义事业，拥护中国共产党的领导，加强全国人民的团结，必须积极地投入反右派的斗争，坚决地给予右派分子以无情痛击，才可使我们社会主义的伟大事业更顺利地前进！
