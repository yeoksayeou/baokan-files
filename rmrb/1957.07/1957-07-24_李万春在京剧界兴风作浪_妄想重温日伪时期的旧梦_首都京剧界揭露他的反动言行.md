Li Wanchun stirs up trouble in the Peking Opera circle
妄想重温日伪时期的旧梦
The capital's Peking Opera circles expose his reactionary words and deeds
    (Our newspaper's report) Peking Opera figures in the capital held a forum on the 22nd and 23rd to expose the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities of Li Wanchun, a scoundrel and rightist in the Peking Opera circle, in the opera circle.
    People in the pear garden trade all know Li Wanchun's ugly history. During the period of the Japanese puppet regime, he colluded with military police, traitors, and secret agents, acted lawlessly, and oppressed his colleagues. He was the godson of female spy Kawashima Yoshiko. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he colluded with Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Eleventh War Zone of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and acted recklessly in the opera circle, taking advantage of his power to seize the Kai Ming Theater (now the Democratic Theater) for himself. After liberation, he was afraid of punishment and did not dare to come north. It was the People's Government that brought him back from the south. However, over the years, he has never known how to repent and has consistently opposed the Party and the government. This time, the rightists took a fancy to him and used him to open a breach. When the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Li Wanchun "joined the Party on the front line" and joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.
    Li Wanchun, following the instructions of Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu, launched a frenzied attack on the Party. The first step was to develop the organization. He drove around in a car, treating people to restaurants and visiting them at their homes. Li Wanchun admitted that they attempted to recruit all the famous actors and well-known veteran artists in the Beijing Peking Opera, Ping Opera, and ballad singing circles into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Someone reported that in order to achieve this evil purpose, Li Wanchun did not hesitate to slander the Communist Party. He promoted to people: "The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is better than the Communist Party, more democratic than the Communist Party; the Communist Party only represents the workers, while the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party represents the peasants and workers." When mobilizing people to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Li Wanchun also said: "The Communist Party is in trouble, it's about to end, if you miss this village, there will be no such shop, if you don't join (the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), you will regret it one day."
    The rightists developed the organization on the one hand and lit the fire on the other. On June 5th, Ye Gongchuo, Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng, and Li Wanchun came forward. This meeting was controlled by the rightists and was chaotic. Some people described the opera undertaking led by the Party after liberation as a complete darkness. Li Wanchun admitted that he felt really happy when he heard these words. He constantly cheered and applauded these slanders at the meeting, interjecting some inflammatory remarks, and pouring tea and water for the speakers!
    Undermining the China Peking Opera Theater is an important aspect of Li Wanchun's conspiracy activities. He spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Peking Opera Theater was poaching people from his troupe. During the "great blooming and contending," he wrote articles in the Beijing Daily attacking the Party's leadership and the China Peking Opera Theater. He also declared triumphantly: "This time, I'm going to settle the score with Ma Shaobo, ask him for people, and ask for costumes!" Mao Shilai, Li Shengzao, Mao Qinglai, Gao Yuanfeng and other actors who had been in Li Wanchun's troupe spoke out to expose that many actors had left Li Wanchun over the years because Li Wanchun implemented a tyrannical rule in the troupe, and the actors could not bear the inhuman treatment. Some of these actors who left his troupe organized their own troupes, and some joined other private professional troupes, and only a few joined the China Peking Opera Theater. Some actors who were squeezed out by Li Wanchun are still wandering outside.
    Even after the anti-rightist struggle began, Li Wanchun continued to carry out activities to disintegrate the Peking Opera Theater. He clamored that Shanghai had opened a "free market," and the actors of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater were all coming out to freely pick classes, and the lay party cadres were all being withdrawn, and Beijing would soon be the same! He also privately instigated individual actors to leave the Peking Opera Theater, and then said: "Some actors in the China Peking Opera Theater are unwilling to do it, the Peking Opera Theater does not give them warmth, we must give them warmth!"
    Li Wanchun also openly clamored in the troupe that he wanted to hang up the signboard of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 led by him, and that he would get rid of the leadership of the Cultural Bureau in the future. Wang Jingbo revealed at the meeting that Li Wanchun also attempted to control the Beijing Peking Opera Workers' Union and the Art Enterprise Company in order to achieve the evil purpose of controlling the actors and theaters in the Peking Opera circle. He also wanted to restore the old system of the "Peking Opera Guild" of the Jinglian in the past,妄想恢复他在日伪时期的“势力”. All of these were denounced by the speakers in unison.
    The forum to expose Li Wanchun has just begun. More than 100 people from the Peking Opera circle participated in this forum, including famous Peking Opera actors Ma Lianliang, Xun Huisheng, Yu Lianquan, Tan Fuying, Li Shaochun, Xi Xiaobo, Qiu Shengrong, Li Shengzao, Ye Shengzhang, Zhang Junqiu, Mao Shilai, Zhao Yanxia, and Li Yuanchun.

    李万春在京剧界兴风作浪
    妄想重温日伪时期的旧梦
    首都京剧界揭露他的反动言行
    本报讯　首都京剧界人士在22、23日举行座谈会，揭露京剧界败类、右派分子李万春在戏曲界进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动。
    梨园行中的人，都知道李万春的丑史。日伪时期，他曾勾结宪兵、汉奸、特务，横行不法，欺压同行。他是女间谍川岛芳子的干儿子。日寇投降后，他又与蒋匪十一战区司令孙连仲勾结，在戏曲界胡作非为，仗势将开明戏院（现在的民主剧场）占为己有。解放以后，他畏罪不敢北来，是人民政府把他从南方接了回来的。然而这些年来，他始终不知改悔，一贯同党和政府对立。这一次，右派分子看中了他，就从他身上来打开缺口。在右派分子向党发动猖狂进攻的时候，李万春“火线入党”，参加了农工民主党。
    李万春秉承章伯钧、李伯球的指示，向党猖狂进攻。第一步是发展组织。他坐了小汽车四出活动，请客上馆子、登门拜访。李万春承认，他们企图将北京市京、评、曲艺界所有的名演员和著名老艺人，网罗入农工民主党。有人检举：为了达到这个罪恶目的，李万春不惜污蔑共产党。他向人宣传说：“农工民主党比共产党好，比共产党民主；共产党只代表工人，农工民主党则代表农民和工人。”李万春在动员人参加农工民主党时还说：“共产党够呛，快完了，过了这村就没有这店了，不入（农工民主党）总有后悔的一天。”
    右派分子一面发展组织，一面点火。6月5日，由叶恭绰、李伯球、李健生、李万春出面，这次会被右派分子所控制，开得乌烟瘴气，有的人把解放后党领导的戏曲事业形容为一团漆黑。李万春承认，他听了这些话，心中真痛快。他在会上不断地为这些谰言喝采和鼓掌，插进去一些煽动性的插话，为发言者倒茶送水！
    搞垮中国京剧院是李万春阴谋活动的一个重要方面。他到处散布谣言，说京剧院从他的剧团拉人。“大放大鸣”期间，他在北京日报上写文章攻击党的领导，攻击中国京剧院。他还得意忘形地宣称：“这回，我可要向马少波算账了，要向他要人，要行头！”曾经在李万春剧团的演员毛世来、李盛藻、毛庆来、高元峰等发言揭露说，这些年来许多演员离开李万春，是由于李万春在剧团实行恶霸式统治，演员们不堪忍受非人的待遇的结果。这些离开了他的剧团的演员，有的自己组织了剧团，有的参加了别的民间职业剧团，只有少数参加了中国京剧院。有些被李万春排挤出来的演员，至今还在外流落。
    直到反右派斗争开展以后，李万春还继续进行瓦解京剧院的活动。他扬言说：上海已开放“自由市场”了，上海京剧院的演员都出来自由挑班了，外行的党员干部都撤下来了，北京也快了！他并且私下里鼓动个别演员脱离京剧院，然后又说：“中国京剧院有的演员不愿干了，京剧院不给他们温暖，我们要给他们温暖！”
    李万春还公开在剧团内扬言：要在他领导的京剧一团挂起农工民主党的牌子，今后要摆脱文化局的领导。王静波在会上揭发，李万春还企图控制北京市京剧工作者联合会和艺术企业公司，以达到控制京剧界演员及各剧场的罪恶目的。他并且要使京联恢复从前的“京剧公会”的旧制度，妄想恢复他在日伪时期的“势力”。所有这些，受到了发言者的同声斥责。
    揭露李万春的座谈会刚刚开始。参加这个座谈会的有京剧界著名演员马连良、荀慧生、于连泉、谭富英、李少春、奚啸伯、裘盛戎、李盛藻、叶盛长、张君秋、毛世来、赵燕侠、李元春等一百余人。
