We farmers know how to defend the fruits of the revolution.
Luo Xianggen sternly warns the rightists:
If you are determined to go down the old road without repentance, then please think about it, are the carrying poles and hoes in our farmers' hands "vegetarian and abstinent"?
I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and other work reports.

The members of our cooperative are very angry when they see the reactionary speeches against the Party and socialism published in the newspapers by the rightists. When I set off to attend the meeting, the members asked me to speak out in Beijing as well. I am a farmer and not good at theory, so I can only talk about my own experiences.

Our cooperative is called the Wudongzha Agricultural Production Cooperative, in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, and mainly grows cotton. It has been more than five years since it was established in 1952. In these five years, the number of members has expanded from fourteen households to one thousand four hundred and sixty-two households, and the cotton yield has increased from an average of 160 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1952 to 324 jin in 1955. The income of the members has improved year by year, from an average of 275 yuan per household in 1952 to 692 yuan in 1955, and life has become better year after year.

In 1956, our cooperative planned to produce 380 jin of cotton per mu. Based on the growth conditions before the disaster, it was completely certain that we could complete the plan. However, just when the cotton was blooming and bearing fruit, and a bumper harvest was imminent, four typhoons came in succession. After the first typhoon of level 12 or above, the cotton was also afflicted with angular leaf spot disease, which was very serious. This caused great losses to our entire cooperative. The cotton yield was only 92 jin of seed cotton per mu, a decrease of more than 70% compared to 1955. Including the losses of other crops, the total loss was more than 1.07 million yuan. At the same time, 450 houses of members and the cooperative were destroyed by the typhoon. After such a major disaster, the members' thoughts were once confused. Some members said that agricultural production was not as good as industrial production and were not willing to engage in agriculture. Some questioned the superiority of cooperation and blamed the typhoon losses on cooperation. Some were passive and afraid of difficulties, fearing that they would not be able to survive and wanted to rely solely on government relief. A few members requested to withdraw from the cooperative, and some even started farming individually.

At that time, we quickly focused on production to overcome the famine and strengthened ideological education for the members. We held many meetings and repeatedly explained the reasons to the members, especially emphasizing that although such a major disaster could not be completely overcome, with the correct leadership and strong support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the collective strength of the cooperative, our losses would be much smaller than those of individual farmers. Our cotton yield was still 92 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the two wealthy farmers who farmed individually only harvested 45 jin of seed cotton per mu. Moreover, we rebuilt all the members' houses in nine days, which reassured the members to focus on production. Doesn't this prove the superiority of being organized? After such a comparison, those with confused thoughts understood that if they did not participate in the cooperative and farmed individually, the losses would be even greater. Therefore, some people said that it is good to keep two individual farming households for comparison. At the same time, we implemented the policy of self-reliance in production and thrift to overcome the famine, and mobilized the members to discuss and formulate plans to increase agricultural and sideline production and measures to save and overcome the famine. In addition to formulating a winter planting plan with an active and reliable spirit, we also adopted the following methods to overcome the famine: (1) Actively carry out various sideline productions (catching fish, chopping firewood, peeling cotton stalks, doing odd jobs), planning to earn 50,000 yuan; (2) Vigorously plant vegetables to overcome the famine, requiring an average of 300 jin per person; (3) Call on members to save. All members unanimously believed that these plans could be realized. At the same time, in order to take care of our difficulties, the state approved the postponement of the repayment of the 170,000 yuan cotton pre-purchase payment, and issued more than 4,000 yuan of social relief funds. In addition, the Shanghai workers' delegation came to our cooperative to offer condolences and also sent sprayers and fertilizer. The members deeply felt the care and support of the state and the workers, and their confidence in overcoming the disaster was even higher. Everyone proposed the slogan of striving for full rice jars, vegetable jars, and firewood sheds during the six-and-a-half-month famine period. This made the members see the superior conditions of the cooperative, and everyone was relieved to focus on production. The members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative at the beginning no longer withdrew.

This year's spring crops have achieved an unprecedented harvest, and sideline production has also completed the plan. When I set off to Beijing to attend the meeting, the spring crops had not yet been fully harvested. The day before yesterday, I received a letter from the cooperative's accountant, saying that the average yield of broad beans was 207 jin per mu, the average yield of rapeseed was 167.3 jin per mu, and although barley was somewhat affected by the heavy rain in April when it was flowering, the average yield was still 320 jin per mu. The bumper harvest of spring crops and the realization of the sideline plan have greatly helped to overcome the difficulties brought about by last year's natural disaster, and at the same time laid a favorable foundation for striving for a bumper harvest this year and ensuring an increase in members' income. Since the spring plowing this year, we have implemented the three directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on running cooperatives democratically. Previously, the main cooperative cadres in our cooperative did not participate in field labor, which was a shortcoming. Now they all personally go to the fields. And we make sure to discuss matters with the members, and the accounts of the cooperative are also disclosed to the members in a timely manner, which the members are very happy about. Now everyone has great enthusiasm for production and is confident in completing and overfulfilling this year's production plan.

We have personally experienced that without the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, without the strong support of the state and the collective strength of the cooperative, we farmers would have embarked on the road of poverty and bankruptcy after the 1956 disaster. We think about the past: the 1926 disaster was not as serious as last year's, but more than 20% of the farmers fled the famine and begged for food, many sold their children, and many went bankrupt and became hired laborers for landlords and rich peasants. Member Wang Mengzhang went bankrupt due to the famine and became a long-term laborer for the landlord until liberation. There are particularly many in our cooperative who have worked as long-term laborers; half of the members have worked as long-term laborers. However, in the face of such a major natural disaster in 1956, no one in our cooperative fled the famine and begged for food, and no one sold their children. We will never suffer the hardships of the famine years again. Therefore, everyone in our cooperative is extremely grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

The kindness of the Communist Party and the benefits of the cooperative are there for all to see. But strangely enough, the rightists oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that "cooperation has been messed up," and that "farmers are sallow and emaciated, and complaints are everywhere." The rightists are shouting so loudly, as if they are "representing" the farmers, but we farmers are not "wooden people," and we can see what kind of stuff you are! I think that if Shen Songpei, the blood-debt-ridden local tyrant landlord and pseudo-township head who was shot in our town's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, were still alive, he would definitely applaud and welcome your words. But we farmers are very angry. Our members say that these people are telling ghost stories in broad daylight. Let them come to our cooperative and see! Although the living standards of our members are not yet high, they are much better than before liberation. Before liberation, the peasants lived a life of cattle and horses. What about now? Every member is well-fed and clothed, and many people also wear woolen sweaters. More than 150 new houses have been built since liberation. The whole cooperative is equipped with twenty-two wired radios, has a people's school, and also has a basketball court. Members have the opportunity to learn culture, play basketball, and listen to the radio during rest. As the saying goes, "It is difficult for gods to determine the price of grain." In last year's famine, the state guaranteed the supply of grain, and the price of grain was stable. Everyone could eat white rice to overcome the famine. Are these not the benefits of the Communist Party leading us on the socialist road? Did they fall from the sky? The rightists also say that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries were terrible. Mr. Huang Shaohong shouted particularly loudly on this issue, repeatedly calling for the maintenance of the rule of law, as if he were a "just and upright official." Speaking of Mr. Huang Shaohong, we people in Zhejiang are very familiar with him. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the enemy was at hand, how many anti-communist "suppressions" were carried out under his rule, and how many communist party members and working people were killed! This account should also be recalled. During Huang Shaohong's tenure as the pseudo-chairman of Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China suffered two major destructions. Comrade Liu Ying, the former secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, was tragically arrested and killed in 1942 under Huang Shaohong's rule. Mr. Huang Shaohong had a "model" county magistrate, Zhang Shaowu, the pseudo-county magistrate of Pingyang County, who killed many people there. In 1943, he even brought the heads of the people he killed to hold a "head exhibition" to intimidate the people. After liberation, Huang Shaohong actually introduced Zhang Shaowu, a heinous murderer, to study at the Political Research Institute of the China Revolutionary University in Beijing. Later, the old people of southern Zhejiang successively requested that Zhang Shaowu be brought to justice, and only then was he escorted back to Zhejiang and sentenced to death. In the eyes of Huang Shaohong and Zhang Shaowu, how could the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries not be "terrible"? But we farmers say that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries are very good. The elderly say, "Killing the extremely evil counter-revolutionaries is truly meritorious."

The rightists are anti-Party and anti-socialist, and are conspiring to drag us back to the old road of the old China colony. But we have traveled enough of that old road for three generations, and we have suffered enough hardships, and we are no longer willing to go. If you rightists are determined to go down the old road without repentance, then please think about it, are the carrying poles and hoes in our farmers' hands "vegetarian and abstinent"? I tell you, we farmers know how to defend our revolutionary fruits. We will always listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party!

    我们农民知道怎样保卫革命果实
    罗祥根正告右派分子：
    你们死不回头，一定要走老路，那么请你们想想看，我们农民手里的扁担锄头是“受戒吃素”的吗？
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告及其他各项工作报告。
    我们社里的社员，看到报纸上登出的右派分子反党、反社会主义的反动言论，大家都很气愤。我动身来开会时，社员们要我到北京也来鸣放一下。我是一个农民，理论讲勿来，只能讲讲自己的体会。
    我们的社叫五洞闸农业生产合作社，在浙江慈溪县，主要是种棉花的。一九五二年成立到现在五年多了。在这五年内，社员由十四户扩大到一千四百六十二户，棉花产量一九五二年每亩平均产籽棉一百六十斤，一九五五年提高到三百二十四斤，社员收入一九五二年每户平均二百七十五元，到一九五五年达到六百九十二元，生活一年好如一年。
    一九五六年我们社里棉花计划产量每亩三百八十斤，根据灾前生长情况完成计划是完全有把握的，但正在开花结铃快要大丰收的时候，谁知连续来了四次台风，在第一次十二级以上大台风以后，棉花又害了角斑病，十分严重。这使我们全社受到了很大的损失，棉花每亩只收籽棉九十二斤，比一九五五年减产七成多，加上其他作物的损失，总计共损失一百零七万多元，同时社员与合作社的房子被台风打垮四百五十多间。在这样大的灾害后，社员思想曾一度混乱，有的社员说农业生产没有工业生产好，不安心搞农业，有的怀疑合作化的优越性，把台风损失归罪于合作化，有的人消极畏难，怕生活过不下去，想单纯依赖政府来救济，少数社员要求退社，个别甚至自动单干起来。
    当时我们迅速抓紧生产度荒工作与加强对社员的思想教育，我们开了不少会，反复向社员讲通道理，特别着重地向社员说明，虽然这样大的灾害不能全部战胜，但是有了共产党与人民政府的正确领导与大力支持，有了合作社的集体力量，我们的损失比起单干户来，却要小得多，我们棉花每亩平均也收到籽棉九十二斤，而两户单干的富裕农民每亩只收到籽棉四十五斤，并且我们九天内把社员的房子全部修建好，使社员安心生产，这些不是正可以说明组织起来的优越性吗？经过这样一对比，那些思想糊涂的人也就明白了，如果不参加合作社，自己单干，损失不是更大吗？所以有人说，留两户单干户比较比较也是好的。同时我们贯彻了生产自救节约度荒的方针，发动社员讨论订出农业副业增产计划和节约度荒的措施，除了以积极可靠的精神拟订好冬种计划外，还采取以下办法度荒：（一）积极进行各种副业生产（捉鱼、砍柴、剥棉秆皮、做小工），计划收入五万元；（二）大力种植青菜度荒，要求每人平均达到三百斤；（三）号召社员节约。全体社员一致认为这些计划能够实现。同时，国家为了照顾我们的困难，十七万元棉花预购款准予缓还，并发了四千多元社会救济款，再加上海工人慰问团到我们社里慰问，还送了喷雾器与肥田粉。社员深深感到国家与工人老大哥对于我们的关怀与支持，战胜灾荒的信心就更高了。大家提出在六个半月度荒期中争取米缸、菜缸、柴仓三满的口号。这样使社员看到合作社的优越条件，大家都安心生产，当初要退社的社员也不退社了。
    今年春花得到了空前的丰收，副业生产也完成了计划，我动身来北京开会时，春花还未全部收割好，前天接到社里会计来信，说蚕豆每亩平均收二百零七斤，油菜每亩平均收一百六十七点三斤，大麦虽然因四月份正在开花时多雨受些影响，但每亩平均仍收三百二十斤。春花丰收和副业计划实现，大大有利于克服去年自然灾害带来的困难，同时对争取今年大丰收、保证社员增加收入打下有利基础。今年春耕以来，我们贯彻了中共中央与国务院关于民主办社的三项指示，以前我们社里主要社干都不参加田间劳动，这是一个缺点，现在统统亲自下田了。并且做到有事与社员商量，社内账目也及时向社员公布，社员反映很好。现在大家生产劲头很大，有信心完成与超额完成今年的生产计划。
    我们亲身体会到，一九五六年的灾害如果没有共产党和毛主席的正确领导，如果没有国家的大力支持与合作社的集体力量，那么我们农民就要走上贫困破产的道路。我们想想过去：一九二六年的灾害还没有去年那样严重，但却有百分之二十以上的农民逃荒讨饭，很多人出卖儿女，许多人破了产给地主富农当雇工，社员王梦章，就因为荒年破了产，给地主当长工，一直当到解放为止。我们这个社当过长工的特别多，有一半社员是当过长工的。但是一九五六年这样大的自然灾害，我们社里没有一个人逃荒讨饭，更没有一个人出卖儿女。从前荒年的苦头现在不会再吃了。因此，我们社里大家都万分感谢共产党，感谢毛主席！
    共产党的恩情，合作社的好处，事实摆在那里，明明白白。但奇怪得很，右派分子竟反对共产党领导，说“合作化搞糟了”，说什么“农民面黄肌瘦，怨声载道”。右派分子这样大叫大喊，好像他们是“代表”农民说话，但是，我们农民不是“木头人”，我们看得清你们是什么货色！你们的话，我想如果我们那里镇反中被枪毙的血债累累的恶霸地主、伪乡长沈松培还在世，一定鼓掌欢迎。但是我们农民很气愤，我们社员说，这些人开着眼青天白日讲鬼话，叫他们来我们社看看吧！我们社员生活水平虽然还不算高，但比解放前好得多了，解放前农民过的是牛马生活。现在呢？社员个个吃饱穿暖，许多人还穿上绒线衣，解放以后盖了一百五十多间新房子。全社装二十二只有线广播机，有民校，还有篮球场，社员休息时都有机会学文化、打篮球、听广播。俗话说“神仙难定谷米价”，去年那样的荒年，国家保证了粮食供应，粮价平稳，大家能吃白米度荒，这些不是共产党领导我们走社会主义道路的好处吗？难道是天上掉下来的吗？右派分子还说什么镇反、肃反糟得很，黄绍竑先生在这个问题上叫得特别响，口口声声要维护法制，好像他是一位“青天大老爷”。说起黄绍竑先生，我们浙江人都很熟悉。抗日期间大敌当前，在他统治下，进行过多少次反共“清剿”，杀了多少共产党员与劳动人民！这笔账也该去回忆回忆，在黄绍竑先生任伪浙江省主席期间，中共浙江省委曾两次遭受大破坏，中共前浙江省委书记刘英同志，就是一九四二年在黄绍竑统治下惨遭逮捕杀害的。黄绍竑先生手下有一个“模范”县长，就是平阳县伪县长张韶舞，在那里杀人极多，一九四三年竟将杀人的人头拿来开“人头展览会”，借以镇慑人民，解放后黄绍竑竟将罪恶滔天的杀人凶犯张韶舞介绍到北京革大政治研究院学习，后来浙南老百姓纷纷要求法办张韶舞，这才解回浙江，判处死刑。在黄绍竑与张韶舞看来，镇反、肃反怎么不“糟得很”呢？但是我们农民说镇反、肃反好得很，年老人说“杀了罪大恶极的反革命分子，真是功德无量”。
    右派分子反党、反社会主义，阴谋将我们拉回到旧中国殖民地的老路上去，但是那条老路我们祖宗三代走够了，苦头吃尽了，再也不愿意走了。如果右派分子们死不回头，一定要走老路，那么请你们想想看，我们农民手里的扁担锄头是“受戒吃素”的吗？告诉你们，我们农民是知道怎样保卫自己革命果实，我们将永远听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走！
