    Japanese Youth Reluctant to Enlist, Military Authorities Extremely Embarrassed
    (By Our Newspaper) According to Japanese newspapers, the trend of Japanese youth being unwilling to enlist has created difficulties for the Japanese government's plan to strengthen the "Self-Defense Forces."
    From April to June this year, the Japanese Defense Agency recruited 9,800 new soldiers for the Army, Navy, and Air Force nationwide for the first term of the year. However, by the deadline of June 10th, only 5,970 people had applied for the Army, whereas the original plan was to recruit 7,700 for the Army. Therefore, the Defense Agency had to extend the deadline to the end of June and convene a meeting of the heads of local liaison departments in all prefectures to decide on large-scale publicity using films, radio propaganda vehicles, and so on.
    However, the situation did not improve as a result. Statistics from "Hokkaido Shimbun" show that the number of applicants last year or the year before was more than three times the number of recruits, but this year the number of applicants for new soldiers has decreased significantly. The Japanese Defense Agency believes that in order to ensure that the quality of new soldiers can reach the minimum standard, at least one person must be selected from among three applicants. The current situation in which Japanese youth are unwilling to enlist has caused great anxiety to the Japanese Defense Agency. (Attached image)
    In the new soldier examination of the Japanese "Nerima Unit" held on July 1st, although there was a great deal of publicity beforehand, there were very few applicants, and only a handful of dozens of people were in the deserted examination hall.

    日本青年不愿当兵  军事当局非常狼狈
    本报讯  据日本报纸报道：日本青年不愿当兵的风气，已经给日本政府加强“自卫队”的计划带来了困难。
    日本防卫厅今年4月至6月在全国招募本年度第一期陆、海、空军新兵九千八百人，可是到截止期6月10日止，报名应募陆军的只有五千九百七十人，而原计划招募陆军七千七百人。因此，防卫厅只好将截止期延长到6月底，并且召集全国各都、道、府、县的地方联络部的负责人举行会议，决定利用电影、广播宣传车等等大规模地展开宣传。
    然而结果情况并未好转。“北海道新闻”的统计数字表明，去年或前年的报名应募人数都为招募名额的三倍以上，今年应募新兵的报名人数显著减少。日本防卫厅认为，要使新兵的质量能够达到最低水准，至少也得在三个报名应募者之中挑选一人。目前日本青年不愿当兵的情况已经引起了日本防卫厅极大的不安。（附图片）
    在7月1日举行的日本“练马部队”的新兵考试中，虽然事前大吹大擂地宣传，可是报名者极少，冷落的考场中只有屈指可数的几十个人。
