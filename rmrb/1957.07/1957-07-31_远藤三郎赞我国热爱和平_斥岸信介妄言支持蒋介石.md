Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th. Endo Saburo, head of the former Japanese military personnel delegation to China, told Xinhua reporters here today that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's remarks in Taiwan supporting Chiang Kai-shek's "recovery of the mainland" were "obviously wrong." He believes that the Japanese people will never have Kishi Nobusuke's view.

Endo Saburo also expressed disbelief in the Japanese government's claim of 35,000 so-called "missing" Japanese people. He believes this is "unimaginable."

Endo Saburo, who led the 19-member delegation, arrived in Hong Kong after visiting the mainland for more than a month. When talking about his impression of New China, Endo Saburo said: "China has a high position in Asia, and China is a strong and peace-loving country."

Endo Saburo also said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army "is a strong army with 100% good discipline."

The former Lieutenant General Staff Officer of the Japanese Military Command and Director-General of the Air Force Armaments Bureau said: "The Chinese army is used to defend its own motherland, and we have indeed seen that China will never invade others."

    远藤三郎赞我国热爱和平  斥岸信介妄言支持蒋介石
    据新华社香港30日电　日本前军人访华团团长远藤三郎今天在这里对新华社记者说，日本首相岸信介在台湾发表支持蒋介石“收复大陆”的谈话“显然是错误的”。他认为，日本人民决不会有岸信介的这种看法。
    远藤三郎还表示不相信日本政府提出的有三万五千名所谓“下落不明”的日本人一事。他认为这是“不可想像的”。
    远藤三郎率领的这个十九人的代表团是在大陆访问了一个多月后来到香港的。在谈到对新中国的印象的时候，远藤三郎说：“中国在亚洲的地位很高，中国是一个强大而又热爱和平的国家。”
    远藤三郎还说，中国人民解放军“是一支强大的、有百分之百良好纪律的军队”。
    这位前日本军令部中将参谋、航空兵器总局长官说：“中国军队是用来保卫自己祖国的，我们确实看到中国决不会侵略别人。”
