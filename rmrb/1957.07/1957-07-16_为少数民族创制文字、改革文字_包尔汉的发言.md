I fully agree with and support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen. These reports summarize the tremendous achievements we have made in socialist transformation and socialist construction in recent years, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of our national system and socio-economic system. Therefore, these reports use ironclad facts to strongly refute the reactionary statements of the right-wing elements who oppose the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the people's democratic dictatorship.

Our great motherland has more than forty ethnic minorities, whose total number is less than forty million, but the area they inhabit accounts for about sixty percent of our country's land area.

Before liberation, the reactionary government not only did not help develop their economy and culture, but also created artificial hatred and carried out massacres among them, leaving them in an even more backward state. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, they have all become members of the People's Republic of China's friendly and cooperative family, enjoying full and equal rights. In order to eliminate the de facto inequality left over by the reactionary government and to achieve genuine equality in economic and cultural aspects, all ethnic minorities, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, with the help of the great Han people, have done a lot of work and are still actively participating in the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction together with the Han people. However, the level of cultural development of these ethnic groups is not uniform. Some ethnic groups do not yet have writing systems that represent their own languages, and even those that do have writing systems are incomplete and cannot meet current needs. Therefore, the development of education, the elimination of illiteracy, the establishment of factories, and the development of agricultural cooperatives in minority areas are all subject to certain limitations and face many difficulties. Therefore, the Central People's Government, in its proposals for the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, put forward the task of creating writing systems (alphabets) for ethnic minorities and helping to reform existing writing systems.

Beginning in 1950, the Chinese Academy of Sciences successively sent linguists and ethnic language workers to many minority areas to investigate ethnic languages, dialects, and writing systems. They studied the languages and writing systems of ethnic groups that already had writing systems and formulated reform plans. In February 1956, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Southwest Institute for Nationalities, and the Central South Institute for Nationalities, established language investigation training classes in Beijing and Chengdu, comprising approximately five hundred people. Starting in April of the same year, together with relevant agencies, they organized seven ethnic minority language investigation teams of approximately seven hundred people, and went to the minority areas of Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Qinghai, Gansu, Heilongjiang provinces, and the Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions, under the leadership of local Party and government leaders, to conduct investigations and research on the dialects and original writing systems of Zhuang, Buyi, Nong, Sha, Li, Dong, Shui, Miao, Yao, Dai, Jingpo (Zaiwa), Lahu, Naxi, Hani, Lisu, Kawa, Yi, Tujia (Hunan), Mongolian, Dongxiang, Tu, Bonan, Daur, Uygur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Xibe, Salar, Yugur, Tibetan, and Qiang ethnic groups. In order to better carry out this work in various ethnic areas, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, Yunnan Province, Guizhou Province, Sichuan Province, and relevant ethnic autonomous prefectures also established language research or language work institutions. In order to study important issues such as whether the original writing systems of various ethnic groups need to be reformed and how to reform them, and in order for scientists and ethnic language workers from the work teams to report the results of language investigation and research to representatives and intellectuals of various ethnic groups, scientific discussions on Mongolian language family languages and Daur language work conferences have been held in Hohhot; Xinjiang ethnic language scientific discussions have been held in Urumqi; Miao language and writing problem scientific discussions, Buyi language and writing problem scientific discussions, and alphabet form problem discussions have been held in Guiyang; Yi language scientific discussions have been held in Chengdu; Li language scientific discussions have been held in Hainan Island, and Yunnan ethnic minority language scientific discussions have been held in Kunming, from May 1956 to the present. Twenty writing system schemes have been designed for fifteen ethnic groups.

The language and writing system issues of ethnic minorities in our country are very complex. In the past few years, under the leadership and concern of the Party and the People's Government, thanks to the efforts of relevant comrades and intellectuals of various ethnic groups, the support of the masses of all ethnic groups, and especially the brotherly assistance given by the great Soviet linguistics experts in the spirit of internationalism, we have achieved many successes and accumulated experiences in ethnic language work. We cannot but express our gratitude to the Soviet experts for their academic assistance.

We still need to study many issues in depth in the future, the most important of which is the issue of alphabet form, that is, what kind of alphabet form should be adopted when creating writing systems for ethnic minorities. The "Report on Helping Ethnic Groups Without Writing Systems Create Writing Systems," which was discussed and approved at the 217th meeting of the former Government Administration Council, pointed out: "In view of the fact that the adoption of the Latin alphabet is more convenient than the current Chinese phonetic alphabet for the alphabet form of the newly created writing systems of various ethnic groups, the Latin alphabet can be basically used as a trial alphabet or phonetic symbol before the Chinese phonetic writing system scheme is announced, and changes will be considered in the future. Some ethnic groups may also use Russian alphabets according to their own wishes because they are adjacent to the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic." At present, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has not yet been officially approved and promulgated, although this is the case, it is still necessary for the leaders and intellectuals of various ethnic groups to conduct in-depth research on which form of alphabet should be adopted by various ethnic groups distributed in various regions.

As mentioned above, we have designed twenty writing system schemes for fifteen ethnic groups. Now we should try them out and further improve them. The experimental promotion of the new writing systems requires a large number of personnel. How to use this writing system in literacy work and at all levels of schools in various ethnic groups, and how to train cadres, are all very important issues. Therefore, I believe that the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, and other relevant departments need to include the language work of ethnic minorities in the work plans of their respective departments. At the same time, scientific research and translation work in various regions also require a certain amount of manpower and various equipment. These should be prepared early. In order to do a good job in creating and reforming writing systems for ethnic minorities, in March 1956, the State Council specially issued a notice on the approval procedures for writing system schemes and the division of labor during experimental promotion after approval. Generally speaking, relevant departments at all levels have earnestly implemented the division of labor method in this notice. However, some departments still do not pay enough attention, and various departments still need to strengthen cooperation and joint research.

As mentioned above, we have achieved great success in ethnic minority language investigation work and in the work of creating new writing systems in a short period of several years. This is a glorious victory for the Chinese Communist Party's great ethnic policy. In order to further meet the needs of various ethnic minorities and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the Central People's Government, we hope that Party and government departments at all levels and relevant comrades will pay more attention to and support this work. We believe that the ethnic language work of our great motherland will achieve greater development.

Fellow delegates: In recent days, the activities of the representatives of bourgeois ideology—the right-wing elements—in opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism have been exposed. We ethnic minorities, who have suffered oppression, humiliation, and grievances from reactionary governments for hundreds of years, express great anger and hatred towards the various reactionary activities of the right-wing elements. Historical and personal experience have made it clear to us that in bourgeois society, not only is it impossible to have equal, friendly, and cooperative relations between ethnic groups, but also ethnic hatred and massacres occur. We are also clearly aware that only in a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party can ethnic problems be completely resolved, and only then can truly loving and cooperative relations of a new socialist type be established between ethnic groups. If there were no Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong's ethnic policy, would we be able to see the achievements mentioned above today? This is very obvious, of course not. Marx once said a hundred years ago: "As class antagonism within nations vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end." Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, ethnic oppression and inequality have been declared over, our great motherland has become a large family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and the antagonism between ethnic groups has also come to an end, thus starting a new socialist ethnic relationship, which is developing and consolidating day by day. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups love and support the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao Zedong. They will always complete the cause of building a great socialist society together with the Han working people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. They will wage a resolute and merciless struggle against those who oppose this cause and attempt to harm the fruits of the people's struggle, and will never allow them to carry out reactionary activities.

    为少数民族创制文字、改革文字
    包尔汉的发言
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长兼秘书长所作的报告。这些报告总结性的指出了我们几年来在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成绩，充分地说明了我们国家制度和社会经济制度具有无比的优越性。因此，这些报告以钢铁般的事实对那些反对共产党、反对社会主义、反对人民民主专政的右派分子的反动言论给予了有力的驳斥。
    我们伟大的祖国有四十多个少数民族，它们的总数虽然不到四千万人，但是分布的地区却占我国土地面积约百分之六十。
    解放前，反动政府不但不帮助发展它们的经济与文化，而且在它们之间制造人为的仇恨和进行了屠杀，使它们处于更加落后的状态。中华人民共和国成立后，它们都已成为中华人民共和国友爱合作大家庭的拥有充分平等权利的成员。为了消除反动政府遗留下来的事实上的不平等，使之在经济、文化各方面达到真正的平等，各少数民族在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在伟大的汉族人民帮助下，已经做了许多工作，并且还在继续和汉族人民一道积极地参加着社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大事业。但是，这些民族的文化发展程度都不一致。有些民族还没有代表它们本民族语言的文字，就是有文字的民族有些文字也不完全，不能适应现在的需要。因此，在少数民族地区发展教育、扫除文盲、建立工厂和发展农业合作社的事业中都受到一定的限制和存在许多困难。因此，中央人民政府在第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划发展国民经济的建议中提出了为少数民族创制文字（字母）和帮助改革文字的任务。
    一九五○年开始，中国科学院相继派遣语言学家和民族语文工作者前往许多少数民族地区调查民族语言、方言和文字。对于已经有文字的民族的语文进行了研究，拟定了改革的方案。一九五六年二月间，中国科学院和中央民族学院、西南民族学院、中南民族学院等合作在北京和成都成立了大约包括五百人的语言调查训练班。当年四月起并和有关机关共同组织了约七百人的七个少数民族语言调查工作队，分别到广西、广东、云南、四川、贵州、湖南、湖北、青海、甘肃、黑龙江等省的少数民族地区和西藏、内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区，在各地党政领导下，对僮、布依、侬、沙、黎、侗、水家、苗、瑶、傣、景颇（载佤）、拉祜、纳西、哈尼、傈僳、佧佤、彝、土家（湖南）、蒙古、东乡、土、保安、达呼尔、维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克、锡伯、撒拉、裕固、藏、羌等民族语言的方言和原有文字进行调查研究。为了使这一工作在各民族地区更好地开展起来，内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、广西省、云南省、贵州省、四川省和有关的民族自治州也成立了语文研究或语文工作机构。为了研究各民族原有文字是不是需要改革、怎样改革等重要问题，和为了使工作队的科学家及民族语文工作者向各民族的代表人物和知识分子报告语言调查研究的成果，从一九五六年五月到现在已分别在呼和浩特召开了蒙古语族语言科学讨论会和达呼尔语文工作会议；在乌鲁木齐召开了新疆民族语文科学讨论会；在贵阳召开了苗族语言文字问题科学讨论会、布依族语言文字问题科学讨论会和字母形式问题讨论会；在成都召开了彝族语文科学讨论会；在海南岛召开了黎族语文科学讨论会，在昆明召开了云南少数民族语文科学讨论会。已经为十五个民族设计了二十种文字方案。
    我国少数民族的语言文字问题是很复杂的，几年来，在党和人民政府的领导和关怀下，由于有关同志和各民族知识分子的努力，各族群众的支持，特别是伟大的苏联语言学专家们以国际主义精神所给予的兄弟般的帮助，使我们在民族语文工作方面获得了不少的成绩和经验。我们对苏联专家给予我们的学术帮助不能不表示感谢。
    我们今后还需要深入研究许多问题，其中最重要的是字母形式问题，也就是说为各少数民族创立文字的时候，应该采取那一种字母形式的问题。在前政务院二百一十七次会议上讨论批准的“关于帮助尚无文字的民族创立文字问题的报告”中指出：“各民族新制文字的字母形式，鉴于采用拉丁字母较现行汉语注音字母有若干便利，在汉语拼音文字方案公布之前，目前基本上可以拉丁字母作为试行字母或记音符号，将来再考虑改变。某些民族因邻近苏联和蒙古人民共和国，也可依其自愿使用俄文字母。”目前汉语拼音方案尚未正式批准公布，虽然这样，分布在各地区的各个民族应采用那种形式的字母，还需要各民族的领袖人物和知识分子们进行深入地研究。
    上面说过，我们已经为十五个民族设计了二十种文字方案。现在应该试行和进一步改善它了。新文字的实验推行工作，需要大批人力。各民族的扫盲工作和各级学校如何使用这种文字，以及如何培养干部等，都是一些非常重要的问题。因此，我认为教育部、文化部等有关部门需要把少数民族的语文工作列入本部门的工作计划内。同时，各地的科学研究和编译工作，也需要一定的人力和各种设备。这些，都应该早作准备。为了作好为少数民族创立和改革文字的工作，在一九五六年三月，国务院特就文字方案的批准程序和批准以后在实验推行时候的分工问题发出了通知。一般说来，各级有关部门对这个通知的分工办法是认真执行的。但是，也有些部门还重视不足，各部门也还需要加强在互相配合，共同研究方面的工作。
    如上所说，我们在短短的几年内，在少数民族语言调查工作中和创立新文字的工作中，已获得了巨大的成绩。这是中国共产党伟大的民族政策的光辉胜利。为了进一步满足各少数民族的需要，完成党和中央人民政府交给我们的任务，希望各级党政及有关部门和有关同志们更加关怀和支持这方面的工作。我们相信，我们伟大祖国的民族语文工作将会得到更大的发展。
    各位代表：在最近的日子里，资产阶级思想的代表——右派分子反对共产党、反对社会主义的活动已经暴露出来了。过去几百年来饱尝反动政府的压迫、侮辱和委屈的我们少数民族，对右派分子的各种反动活动表示极大的愤怒和痛恨。历史的和切身的经验都使我们清楚地看到，在资产阶级的社会里，民族之间不但不可能有平等、友好、合作的关系，而且还发生着民族仇恨和屠杀的现象。我们也清楚地认识到，只有在共产党领导下的社会主义社会，民族问题才能得到彻底解决，民族之间才可能建立起新的社会主义的真正友爱合作的关系。倘若没有中国共产党和毛泽东民族政策的话，试问我们今天还能够见到以上所说的成就吗？这是非常明显的，当然不可能。马克思在一百年以前曾经说过：“民族内部的阶级对抗一消灭，民族间的敌视关系也就会跟着消灭。”自从中华人民共和国成立后，民族压迫和不平等就宣告结束，我们的伟大祖国就成了各民族友爱合作的大家庭，民族间的对抗也宣告结束，从而开始了新的社会主义民族关系，这种关系正在一天比一天发展和巩固着。因此，各民族人民热爱并拥护中国共产党和各民族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，他们将永远在中国共产党的领导下和汉族劳动人民在一起，完成建设伟大的社会主义社会的事业。他们要和反对这一事业，企图损害人民斗争果实的人作坚决无情的斗争，绝对不容许他们进行反动活动。
