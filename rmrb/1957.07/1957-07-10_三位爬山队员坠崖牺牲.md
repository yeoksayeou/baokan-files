Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced today that three members of the ACFTU mountaineering team, Shi Xiu, Guo Decun, and Peng Zhongmu, unfortunately fell to their deaths while returning to base camp from the main peak of Mount Gongga.

On June 13, six members of the ACFTU mountaineering team who conquered the main peak were struck by a blizzard while descending the ridge at an altitude of 6,800 meters. At that time, clouds and fog filled the air, accompanied by thunder and lightning. Although the team members were roped together and descending a steep slope of hard ice and snow, they sometimes had to release their ice axes and proceed slowly to avoid being struck by lightning. At that time, team members Peng Zhongmu, Shi Xiu, and Guo Decun suddenly slipped on the ice slope in the heavy fog and quickly fell to their deaths from a cliff more than 2,000 meters high.

Shi Xiu, Guo Decun, Peng Zhongmu, and others were outstanding mountaineers in our country. They had climbed Europe's highest peak, Mount Elbrus. Last year, they also participated in the Sino-Soviet joint mountaineering team and climbed Mount Muztag Ata, the "Father of Ice Mountains."

Shi Xiu was from Henan and one of China's earliest mountaineers. Peng Zhongmu was a forest worker exiled from Sichuan. Guo Decun was a public security officer from the Manzhouli Railway.

    三位爬山队员坠崖牺牲
    新华社8日讯　中华全国总工会今天宣布：全总爬山队队员师秀、国德存、彭仲穆三人，在从贡嘎山主峰返回大本营途中，不幸坠崖牺牲。
    6月13日，全总爬山队征服主峰的六位队员在从主峰回到拔海六千八百公尺处山脊时，突然遇到暴风雪袭击。那时，云雾迷漫，雷电交加。队员们虽然正从冰雪坚硬的陡坡结组下山，为了避免电击，有时只得放开冰镐，缓步前进。当时，队员彭仲穆、师秀、国德存三人在大雾中突然从冰坡上滑倒，迅速坠下二千多公尺高的断崖身亡。
    师秀、国德存、彭仲穆等三人是我国优秀的爬山运动员。他们曾登上欧洲最高峰——厄尔布鲁士峰。去年，他们还参加过中、苏混合爬山队，登上了“冰山之父”慕士塔格山。
    师秀是河南人，我国最早的爬山运动员之一。彭仲穆是四川的森林流放工人。国德存是满洲里铁路的公安人员。
