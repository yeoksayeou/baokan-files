    The American tobacco company is selling a cigarette washed with a special solution. It is said that this cigarette is less harmful. Recently, the widely circulated "Reader's Digest" magazine published an article expressing doubts about the safety of this cigarette, which aroused dissatisfaction from the tobacco company. As a result, the magazine received a notice from an advertising company, asking it to find another avenue for advertising. According to the person in charge of the advertising company: "We believe this is a conflict of interest, and we must maintain our biggest client." It turns out that the advertising company's biggest client is the tobacco company, from which it can receive $15 million in advertising revenue each year, while it only receives $2 million from "Reader's Digest."

    广告公司的最后通牒
    美国烟草公司正在推销一种用特制的溶液洗过的香烟。据说，这种香烟的危害性较少。最近，销路很大的“读者文摘”杂志登了一篇对这种香烟的安全程度表示怀疑的文章，引起了烟草公司的不满。结果，这家杂志便接到某广告公司的通知，要它另找门路。据这家广告公司的负责人说：“我们认为这是一件利害冲突的事，而我们必需保持我们最大的主顾”。原来，这家广告公司最大的主顾是烟草公司，每年从它那里可收入一千五百万美元的广告费，而从“读者文摘”那里只收到二百万元。
