    A Night on Miao Mountain (A Diary Entry from November 2, 1934)
    Xie Fumin
    After crossing Little Miao Mountain, the sun was swallowed by an unnamed mountain to the west, and the sky slowly darkened. At exactly eight o'clock, we arrived at the campsite, Da Miao Chuan (a very large river valley, so we just call it Da Miao Chuan). After entering the valley, we could see countless torches all over the mountain, lighting the way for people to find their quarters. Around nine o'clock, the torches gradually thinned out.

    Around nine o'clock, each unit reported to the Political Department: not a single civilian could be found in the entire valley. What would the troops eat for breakfast tomorrow? At that time, Division Political Commissar Zhong Chibing and Division Political Department Director Tang Tianji were also convening several section chiefs from our Political Department to discuss this matter. Commissar Zhong said, "Tell each unit not to worry. Let each unit cook supper and go to sleep. This is a minority area, and it is forbidden to touch anything. Each unit must strictly manage and inspect." At the meeting, it was decided that the only way to solve the problem was to bring the masses back first.

    The masses, how to find them? The staff of the Political Department prepared torches while worrying. I and Yang Dachang, the head of the Enemy Work Section, were also sitting in the room, worrying. Just then, Little Jin from the Propaganda Team pushed open the door and came in: "Reporting to the section chief, a villager has brought us a small, fat pig." When I heard that there was a villager, I was overjoyed and quickly said, "Great, please ask him to come in and talk."

    The villager was about sixty years old, very strong, and holding a small, fat pig. As soon as he entered the door, he knelt down. We didn't know what to do and quickly helped him up. The old man rattled off a long string of words that I couldn't understand at all. Just as we were in a difficult situation, Little Jin spoke fluently: "This old man is the owner of this house, his surname is Wei. He says he has nothing, only this little fat pig. Just now, comrades from the Special Agent Company wanted to buy it, but he wouldn't sell it. Now he is bringing this pig to give to the 'officials.'" After listening, I asked strangely, "How do you understand what the old man is saying?" Little Jin smiled and replied, "Maybe I'm from the same ethnic group as the people here!" I pulled Little Jin over, pulled the old man over, shook his hand, and said, "Thank you, old man, we don't want your little fat pig. You take it back and fatten it up to sell for money." Then I explained to him, "We are the Red Army led by the Communist Party, the workers', peasants', and all nationalities' own army, and we will never take a single needle or thread from the people." After Little Jin translated for him, the old man immediately burst into tears.

    At that moment, I thought: to get the masses back, we have to ask this old man to find a way. I talked about this matter, and the old man sighed and said, "Everyone doesn't know that the troops are so good, so they all ran up the mountain." He also said with certainty: "It can be called back, but there's no way to call tonight." Little Jin was quick to say, "Don't worry, we'll go with you to call."

    I immediately called Li, the leader of the Propaganda Team, brought ten propagandists, fully armed, and went myself with them.

    At 9:10, led by Grandpa Wei, we began to climb the mountain along a small path. Under the illumination of five torches, after an hour, we walked about eight li and stopped. Grandpa Wei shouted loudly in the Miao language. He shouted a few times, but no one responded. Everyone was anxious. Just then, another mountain not far away boomed—it was the sound of a flintlock. Everyone was a little nervous. Team Leader Li told everyone to sit down and lower the torches.

    At this time, Grandpa Wei shouted for a while, then stopped. In less than ten minutes, there was a creaking sound of branches not far to our left. Grandpa Wei shouted twice, and someone responded from the left front. Then three people appeared, one holding a gun and two holding machetes. At first, they were a little scared. After Grandpa Wei and Little Jin spoke for a while, they shook hands with us.

    I asked Little Jin to tell them the purpose of our coming to the mountains. After they listened, they nodded, and a young man immediately blew a cow horn.

    People from all directions ran towards our torches. In less than ten minutes, we were surrounded by no less than a hundred people. Each of them held a weapon (guns, knives, spears). Grandpa Wei spoke, Little Jin also said a few words, and I also said a few words.

    Because the troops had to eat and march early the next morning, we couldn't stay on the mountain for long, so we hurried down the mountain. Seventy-five villagers came back with us, and another twenty or so were assigned to go to various places to call the villagers back. Soon after we returned to the village, bright torches lit up all over the mountains, and the masses returned home from all the mountains.

    It was already twelve o'clock at night. Political work cadres from each unit were busy: holding forums and get-togethers with the masses. After some mobilization, the masses took out grain, chickens, ducks, fish, eggs, dried vegetables, etc., and sent them to the troops living in their houses. Then the troops had to do some work: politely refusing these things. The villagers all said in unison: "We didn't know what kind of army you were, so we ran up the mountain. We're really sorry. Now that we're back, you're being so polite." When they heard that the troops needed grain, they all took out grain to sell. We bought it at six silver dollars per hundred catties. In less than an hour, each unit had bought grain. But when buying grain, another problem arose: all the grain bought was glutinous rice. Some units said that their legs would become weak after eating glutinous rice and they couldn't walk. After understanding, it turned out that only glutinous rice was produced here. Everyone had to say, "Okay, let's just treat it as celebrating the New Year!"

    The next day, the troops set off at seven o'clock. The Miao compatriots also got up early and waved goodbye at each intersection and roadside. The Propaganda Team was again assigned to each landlord's house to check discipline. When asked at each house, each house said, "Our own troops are too good, there's nothing to say. We wish you a safe journey!"

    苗山一夜（1934年11月2日的一页日记）
    谢扶民
    翻过小苗山，太阳已被西面的一个无名大山吞没了，天慢吞吞地黑下来。八时整，到了宿营地大苗川（这里是很大的一条川，我们就叫它大苗川）。入川后，远远看去，满山川都是点点的火把，这是照着去找自己的宿舍的。约莫九点钟，火把才渐渐地少了。
    九点钟左右，各单位都到政治部来报告：全川一个老百姓都找不到，部队明早没有粮食怎么办？当时师政委钟赤兵同志和师政治部主任唐天际同志也正在召集我们政治部几个科长商量此事。钟政委说，告诉各单位不要着急，让各单位煮夜饭吃了睡觉。此地是少数民族地区，不准乱动一点东西，各单位要严格管理、检查。在会议上研究，认为只有先把群众找回来，才有办法。
    群众，怎么去找呢？政治部的工作人员一面准备火把，一面发愁。我和敌工科长杨大昌同志也坐在屋里发愁。正在这时，宣传队的小金推开房门进来了：“报告科长同志，有一个老乡给我们送来了一只小肥猪。”我听说有了老乡，不由得心里一喜，忙说：“很好，请他进来谈谈。”
    那老乡约有六十来岁，身体很壮，怀里抱只小肥猪。他一进门就跪下了。弄得我俩不知所措，连忙扶他起来。这位老大爷叽哩咕噜地说了一大串，我一句也听不懂。正在为难时，小金却滔滔不绝地说：“这位老大爷就是这栋房子的主人，他姓韦。他说他什么也没有，只有这只小肥猪，刚才特务连的同志来要买它，他不卖，现在他就将这只猪拿来送给‘长官’大人。”听完了，我奇怪地问：“你怎么懂这位老大爷的话？”小金笑了笑回答：“大概我和这里人是同族吧！”我把小金拉过来，又把那位老大爷拉过来，握了握他的手，说：“谢谢你，老大爷，你的小肥猪我们不要，你把它拿回去，喂大了好卖钱。”接着我又向他解释：“我们是共产党领导的红军，是工人农民及各民族自己的队伍，决不乱拿老百姓的一针一线。”小金给他翻译以后，老大爷登时流下了眼泪。
    这时我想：要找群众回来，就得请这位老大爷设法。我谈起这件事，老大爷叹了一口长气说：“大家不知道队伍这么好，所以都跑上山了。”他又肯定地说：“可以叫回来，但夜里没法去叫。”小金嘴快，马上说：“不怕，我们同你一路去叫。”
    我当即叫宣传队李队长来，带上十个宣传员，全副武装，由我自己带着去。
    九点十分，由韦大爷带路，我们开始沿着一条小道爬山。在五支火把的照耀下，经过一个钟头，走了约莫八里路，就停下来，由韦大爷大声地用苗语叫喊。叫了几声没有人应，大家都急了，正在这时候，不远处另一个山头轰?地响了一声，这是火药枪的声音。大家都有些紧张。李队长叫大家坐下，把照明火把也放低了。
    这时，韦大爷喊叫了一阵，又停下来。不到十分钟，在我们左前方不远处有树枝嘎嘎吱吱作响。韦大爷又叫了两声，左前方有人应声了。接着出现了三个人，一个手执着枪，两个手握着马刀。开始他们有些害怕，经韦大爷和小金说了一阵后，他们就跟我们拉起手来。
    我要小金给他们说说我们到山里来的目的，他们听后点了点头，一个小伙子立即吹起牛角。
    四面八方的人都向我们的火把跑来了，不到十分钟，我们身边就挤满了不下一百人。他们每人手里都拿一件家伙（枪、刀、长矛）。韦大爷讲了讲，小金也说了几句，我也讲了几句话。
    因为明天一早部队还得吃饭、行军，我们不能在山上久待，便赶着下山了。跟我们回来的老乡有七十五人，另有二十多人分到各地去叫老乡们回来。我们回村子不久，四方八面的山头上燃起一片片明亮的火把，群众都从各个山头上回家了。
    这时已是夜间十二点钟了。各单位的政治工作干部都忙起来：与群众一起开座谈会、联欢会……。经过一番动员，群众都纷纷将粮食、鸡、鸭、鱼、鸡蛋、菜干等拿出来，送给住在自己房子的部队。于是部队又得作一番工作：把这些东西婉言谢绝了。老乡都异口同声地说：“我们不懂得你们是什么军队，就跑上了山，实在对不起；现在我们回来了，你们倒客气起来了。”他们听说部队需要的是粮食，就都把粮食拿出来卖。我们按六块大洋一百斤购买。不到一个钟头，各单位的粮食都买到了。但是在买粮食时又发生了一个问题：买到的都是糯米，有的单位说是吃了糯米脚发软，走不动路。经过了解。原来这里只产糯米。大家只好说：“好吧，就算过一个年节吧！”
    第二天，部队七点钟出发。苗族同胞们也早起，在各道口、路旁招手欢送。宣传队又被分派到各房东家去检查纪律。到每家问，每家都说：“自己的队伍，太好了，没啥说的。祝你们一路平安！”
