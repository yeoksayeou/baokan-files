    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 25th. The anti-Rightist struggle within Shanghai's democratic parties has greatly developed and achieved preliminary victory in just one month. Most of the bourgeois rightists who engaged in conspiratorial activities have been exposed and subjected to appropriate criticism and struggle, and these rightists have been isolated among the masses. The leaders of the Shanghai local organizations of the democratic parties affirmed this achievement at a joint meeting held on the evening of the 23rd.
    This joint meeting was held by the democratic parties to study how to further carry out the anti-Rightist struggle. The meeting also pointed out that the anti-Rightist struggle has only just begun to deepen, and the development of the anti-Rightist struggle within the various parties is extremely uneven. The masses have not been mobilized deeply or widely enough, and the core forces of the anti-Rightist campaign and rectification have not been well organized. Especially among the leadership, there is still more or less a lack of understanding of this movement, as well as subjective weaknesses such as indecision and sentimentalism. Therefore, the organizational work has not been correspondingly changed to adapt to the needs of the movement, and some parties have not yet made clear action plans. The heads of the democratic parties unanimously agreed at the meeting that the rectification leadership groups should be established as soon as possible, and those that have already been established should be enriched and strengthened.
    At the meeting, representatives of the democratic parties pointed out that some rightists are still resisting stubbornly, some are "waiting for work," preparing to drag out the struggle, some are feigning surrender, and some are pulling in people with minor problems to make joint self-criticisms in an attempt to muddle through. Therefore, everyone believes that it is necessary to further mobilize the masses, fully collect facts, study and analyze the rightists' arguments, and thoroughly expose and refute them.
    The leaders of the Shanghai local organizations of the democratic parties also unanimously agreed that on the basis of thoroughly defeating the rightists, it is necessary to carry out long-term and arduous ideological work through rectification to educate the members of their own parties.
    At the meeting, Liu Shuzhou, head of the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, explained the principles and policies of the anti-Rightist struggle.
    Wang Kunlun, Sun Xiaocun, Min Ganghou, Ge Zhicheng, Fang Liang, and other central leaders of the democratic parties who recently came to Shanghai to assist the local organizations in carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle also attended the meeting.
    The meeting also decided that during the anti-Rightist struggle, such joint meetings would be held once a week to exchange information and experience, so as to facilitate joint operations against the rightists.

    在反右派斗争取得初步胜利的基础上
    上海各民主党派整顿斗争队伍
    新华社上海25日电　上海市各民主党派内部的反右派斗争在短短的一个月中有了很大的发展，取得了斗争的初步胜利。大部分进行阴谋活动的资产阶级右派分子已被揭露出来，并且进行了适当的批判和斗争，这些右派分子在群众中已经孤立。各民主党派上海市地方组织领导人在23日晚上举行的联席会议上肯定了这个成绩。
    这一次联席会议是各民主党派为了研究如何进一步开展反右派斗争而举行的。会上同时指出：反右派斗争还只是开始深入，各党派内部反右派斗争的发展还极不平衡，群众发动得还不深不广，反右派和整风的核心力量还没有很好地组织起来。特别在领导层中间，还或多或少地存在着对这个运动认识不足以及优柔寡断、温情主义等主观上的弱点。因而在组织工作上还没有为适应运动的需要而作相应的改变，部分党派也还没有作出明确的行动方案。各民主党派负责人在会上一致同意应该尽快地把整风领导小组建立起来，已经成立整风领导小组的应该充实、加强。
    会上各民主党派代表指出，目前有些右派分子还在顽抗，有的“以逸待劳”，准备把斗争拖下去，有的假投降，有的拉问题不大的人做联合检讨，企图蒙混过关。因此大家认为，必须进一步发动群众，充分搜集事实，研究分析右派分子的论点，彻底加以揭露和批驳。
    各民主党派上海市地方组织领导人还一致认为，在彻底打垮右派的基础上，需要通过整风进行较长期的和艰巨的思想工作，教育自己党派的成员。
    会上，中共上海市委统战部部长刘述周就反右派斗争的方针和政策作了解释。
    最近前来上海协助地方组织进行反右派斗争的各民主党派中央领导人员王昆仑、孙晓村、闵刚侯、葛志成、方亮等也参加了会议。
    会议还决定在反右派斗争期间，这样的联席会议每周举行一次，以交流情况、经验，便于对右派分子联合作战。
