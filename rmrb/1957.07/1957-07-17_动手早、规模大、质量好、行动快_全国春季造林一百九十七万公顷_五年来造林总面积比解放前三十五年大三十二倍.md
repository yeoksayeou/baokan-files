Xinhua News Agency dispatch by reporter Yang Yi: This year, China's planned afforestation area is equal to twice the forest area of the British mainland; spring afforestation alone has completed more than 65% of this plan. According to incomplete statistics from twenty provinces and cities, the total spring afforestation area is approximately 1.97 million hectares. The amount of afforestation in the first half of the year exceeded the average of the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan. The quality of afforestation has also significantly improved this year. It is understood that nationwide, spring afforestation generally meets national quality standards in 80% of cases, with the highest areas reaching 95%.

In the years since liberation, especially after the call to green the motherland in twelve years, the nationwide large-scale afforestation movement has been unprecedented. According to statistics, from 1953 to the present, the national afforestation area in the past five years accounts for about 1% of the national land area, with an absolute figure more than thirty-three times greater than the total afforestation area in the thirty-five years before liberation. The total forest area in China now exceeds that of India, and ranks only after the Soviet Union, Indonesia, the United States, and Canada among the world's major countries. Of course, due to China's vast territory and large population, the existing forest area is still very small compared to the land and population, lagging behind many countries.

This year's spring afforestation has five major characteristics: First, Party committees and governments at all levels have strengthened their leadership over afforestation work, and many leading cadres have led the masses to plant trees themselves. Second, the northern regions have changed the past practice of decentralized afforestation this year, adopting a method of concentrated, contiguous, and furrowed planting, resulting in greater effectiveness. Third, this year's spring afforestation in various places generally started early, was large in scale, high in quality, and quick in action. For example, in Henan Province, where climatic conditions are very complex, spring afforestation began at the end of February and was basically completed in just one month. Fourth, this year's afforestation efforts in various places have paid great attention to combining the current interests of the masses with long-term interests, and have focused on mobilizing the masses to develop mountain forest sideline production and develop economic forests with fast and long-term returns. For example, the experience of intercropping miscellaneous grains in forests in Jinbei Daquan Mountain, Shanxi, was promoted in the north, and the technology of intercropping forests and grains was promoted in the south. Fifth, young people played a significant role in this year's spring afforestation, and their afforestation work was generally praised for being "well-informed, enthusiastic, confident, tenacious, and unafraid of difficulties."

The brilliant achievements in this year's spring afforestation are due to the greening plan last year, which encouraged the broad masses of cadres and the masses; last year also conducted afforestation work inspections, and various places have made some technical preparations for this year's afforestation. All localities have established or improved specialized afforestation agencies, and this year they have convened specialized afforestation meetings. While carrying out forestry publicity, forestry departments in various places have also generally trained foresters for agricultural cooperatives. Various localities have also rectified the forestry organizations of agricultural cooperatives; reasonably resolved the issue of afforestation remuneration for cooperative members; and generally implemented measures for contracting planting to ensure survival and contracting for tending.

There are still some shortcomings in the current afforestation work that need to be overcome, and the achievements in various places are uneven. For example, the afforestation inspection carried out last year, due to insufficient assessment of achievements, once affected the afforestation enthusiasm of some grassroots cadres and the masses. Some places have also underestimated the favorable conditions brought about by agricultural cooperation for afforestation and have not fully relied on agricultural cooperatives to actively afforest. The progress of afforestation in these areas is slow and uneven. Some grassroots cadres emphasize the current interests of the masses, are willing to cut down trees, and are unwilling to plant trees. There are also problems of uneven surplus and shortage of seedlings between regions.

### 动手早、规模大、质量好、行动快  全国春季造林一百九十七万公顷  五年来造林总面积比解放前三十五年大三十二倍

    动手早、规模大、质量好、行动快
    全国春季造林一百九十七万公顷
    五年来造林总面积比解放前三十五年大三十二倍
    新华社讯　新华社记者杨义报道：今年我国造林的计划面积等于英国本土森林面积的二倍；春季造林就完成了这个计划的65％以上。据二十个省、市的不完全统计，春季造林共约一百九十七万公顷。全国上半年的造林数量，超过了第一个五年计划头四年的平均数。造林质量今年也有显著提高。据了解，在全国范围内春季造林一般有80％合乎国家规定的质量规格，最高的地区达到了95％。
    解放后几年来，特别是十二年绿化祖国的号召提出后，全国声势浩大的造林运动是空前的。据统计，从1953年开始到目前为止，五年来全国造林面积大约占到了全国土地的1％，绝对数字达到了解放前三十五年造林总面积的三十三倍多。现在我国的森林总面积已经超过了印度，而在世界几个主要国家中仅次于苏联、印度尼西亚、美国和加拿大。当然，由于我国国土广大，人口众多，现有森林面积和国土、人口比仍然很小，落在许多国家的后面。
    今年春季造林有五大特点：一、今年各地党和政府对造林工作的领导加强了，不少领导干部领导群众亲手造林。二、北方地区今年改变了过去分散造林的作法，采取了集中、成片、成沟地营造的办法，因而收效大。三、今年各地春季造林，一般动手早、规模大、质量高、行动快，如气候条件非常复杂的河南省，2月底开始春季造林，仅一个月时间就基本完成了。四、今年造林各地很注意使群众的目前利益和长远利益结合起来，注意了发动群众开展山林副业生产，发展收益快、收益期长的经济林。如北方推广了山西晋北大泉山林中种杂粮经验，南方推广了林、粮间作技术。五、今年春季造林中青年人的作用很大，他们的造林工作普遍获得：“认识好，劲头大，信心足，顽强坚韧不怕困难”的好评。
    今年春季造林工作成绩辉煌，是由于去年的绿化规划鼓励了广大干部和群众；去年又开展过造林工作检查，各地对今年造林都作了些技术上的准备。各地都建立或健全了造林的专门机构，今年都召开过造林专业会议。各地林业部门在开展林业宣传的同时，还普遍为农业社训练了林业员。各地还整顿了农业社的林业组织；合理解决了社员的造林报酬问题；一般实行了包栽保活、包抚育的措施。
    当前造林工作中仍然有一些缺点须注意克服，而且各地的成绩是不平衡的。如去年开展的造林检查，由于对成就估计不够，曾经影响了一些基层干部和群众的造林积极性。有些地方还对农业合作化为造林工作带来的有利条件估计不够因而未充分依靠农业社积极造林。这些地区造林进度迟缓、不平衡。有些基层干部强调群众目前利益，愿意砍伐，不愿造林。地区之间还有种苗余缺不均等问题。
