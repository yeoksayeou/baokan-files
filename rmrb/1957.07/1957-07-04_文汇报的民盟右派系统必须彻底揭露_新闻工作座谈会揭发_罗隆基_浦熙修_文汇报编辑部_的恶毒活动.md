Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. At today's continued news work forum, news workers from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places listed many facts, exposing the reactionary Zhang-Luo alliance's vicious activities of using Pu Xixiu and Wenhui Daily to oppose the Party, the people, and socialism.

Today, about 400 people attended the forum. Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng attended the meeting and spoke. However, everyone was extremely dissatisfied with their speeches, especially Pu Xixiu's. Many people wrote notes to the meeting's host, requesting Pu Xixiu and others to continue to make profound self-criticisms and confessions.

Zhang-Luo Alliance Has Long Used Wenhui Daily as an Anti-Party Tool

Zhang Shuren, a Communist Party member who was squeezed out of Wenhui Daily by Xu Zhucheng and others and now works at the Teachers' Newspaper, revealed that the Zhang-Luo alliance and Pu Xixiu had long used Wenhui Daily as an anti-Party tool. Zhang Shuren said: During the discussion of the draft constitution, Pu Xixiu gave the newspaper a manuscript written by Luo Longji, boasting that he was China's constitutional authority. We raised different opinions and asked them to reconsider, but Luo Longji did not consider them at all and even scolded us and the People's Daily. Last year, Pu Xixiu inspected Shanxi as a member of the CPPCC. The secretary of the Taiyuan Machine Factory Party Committee introduced her to the work of intellectuals, mentioning the erroneous ideas of individual cadres, such as "those who fought for the country do not sit, and those who sit for the country do not fight," and said that this idea had been criticized and corrected by the Party organization. However, Pu Xixiu provided this "material" to Luo Longji. Luo then made a wild speech at the National People's Congress last year, using this "material" to attack the Party and win over intellectuals. Zhang Shuren also mentioned that Yan Baoli, the deputy editor of Wenhui Daily, had a close relationship with Zhang Bojun and had boasted about this relationship to many people. He demanded that Yan Baoli honestly confess his relationship with Zhang Bojun. In his speech, Zhang Shuren demanded that Xu Zhucheng thoroughly examine his behavior of opposing the Party's leadership and squeezing out Communist Party members, and further confess his relationship with Luo Longji.

Tang Hai of Wenhui Daily said at the meeting that since the Wenhui Daily resumed publication in October last year, the persons in charge, Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu, had followed the line of Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun. During the period of great blooming and contending, Wenhui Daily implemented the reactionary policy of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. Since mid-May, Xu Zhucheng had acted arbitrarily in the newspaper, ignoring the opinions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party organization within the newspaper, and refused to publish the newspaper's editorials on rectification with a gentle breeze and drizzle written by Party members within the newspaper. He believed that criticism should not talk about achievements, there should be no counter-criticism during the blooming and contending period, there was no need to talk about the transformation of intellectuals, and he removed articles in this regard. Tang Hai also mentioned that many reports from the Beijing Office of Wenhui Daily, led by Pu Xixiu, were intended to come from the Zhang-Luo reactionary group of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. For example, regarding the issue of intellectuals, Pu Xixiu believed that only Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong were familiar with intellectuals. She sent many of Luo Longji's speeches on intellectuals at the CPPCC and repeatedly asked reporters to write interviews with Fei Xiaotong. Pu Xixiu often explained some issues by saying, "This is Mr. Luo's view." Sometimes, when Pu Xixiu was not in Beijing, Luo Longji would directly call to direct the reporters. He said that Pu Xixiu still did not have enough understanding of such serious mistakes, and although she had been helped by her colleagues in the newspaper many times, she had not yet confessed the main issues. Tang Hai said that the majority of Wenhui Daily staff resolutely supported yesterday's editorial in the People's Daily, were prepared to thoroughly criticize the mistakes of Wenhui Daily in the past, and actively participate in the struggle against the rightists.

Qin Ming, a teacher in the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, read an open letter he wrote to Xu Zhucheng at the meeting, pointing out that Xu Zhucheng's remarks of hating and insulting Communists had been applauded and resonated by the enemies in Taiwan. He also narrated the help and support that the Communist Party had given to Wenhui Daily and Xu Zhucheng from before liberation until now, and questioned why Xu Zhucheng was so ungrateful, repaying kindness with hatred, and using Wenhui Daily to engage in anti-people activities. He also said that Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and Wenhui Daily had at least eight or nine years of relationship. If Xu Zhucheng was still willing to return to the people's socialist stance, he should thoroughly expose these relationships.

Xia Jingfan of the People's Daily criticized Wenhui Daily for implementing the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist line of the Zhang-Luo alliance, based on the materials of Wenhui Daily's previous speeches, news reports, and layout aspects. Xia Jingfan said that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the rectification instructions, requiring to carry it out in a guided, planned, and focused manner, but Wenhui Daily advocated pushing the blooming and contending immediately to primary and secondary schools, setting fires everywhere, wishing to burn the fire all at once, fearing that the world would not be chaotic. Wenhui Daily endlessly exaggerated the shortcomings of work, obliterating achievements. Such as some news titles "Waste of youth, buried talent", "High walls, deep ditches and mountains away", and so on. Xia Jingfan said: What kind of newspaper is this? Some people said, "Is this published in Taiwan?". Xia Jingfan also revealed that Wenhui Daily was also preparing to report on Hu Feng's recent situation. Xia Jingfan said: They are using the method of dealing with the enemy to deal with the people.

Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu Spoke at the Meeting, But Did Not Confess the Main Issues

Then, Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu spoke. Xu Zhucheng said that after reading the People's Daily's July 1 editorial, he "more clearly recognized the viciousness of the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy, and also understood more clearly the seriousness of the mistakes he had committed against the Party and the people by being exploited." Xu Zhucheng said: Although the Beijing Office of Wenhui Daily had an editorial board, Pu Xixiu did not consult the editorial board when something happened, but consulted Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun. When Wenhui Daily was preparing to resume publication last year, the relationship with the Teachers' Newspaper was very bad. Luo Longji first said to us that Wenhui Daily's resumption of publication should seize the time, otherwise it would not work. Later, he said to us through Pu Xixiu that the Teachers' Newspaper could not find cadres and deliberately wanted to drag you to next year, you must strive to take the initiative. Last year, when Wenhui Daily was preparing the most intensely, Pu Xixiu went to Beidaihe for more than a week, saying that she had made an appointment with Luo Longji. Everyone knows that the Zhang-Luo anti-Party alliance was formed during that trip to Beidaihe. Xu Zhucheng said that he examined the reasons why Wenhui Daily was exploited by Zhang and Luo, and he believed that the root cause was his "position problem" and his "attitude towards the Party". Xu Zhucheng said that before liberation, the Party cared for and supported Wenhui Daily, but he had always kept a distance from the Party members. The reason was that he was "enthusiastic about running Wenhui Daily as a 'detached' private newspaper." After liberation, he "was still dreaming of running a private newspaper." Due to the position of "running a private newspaper", Xu Zhucheng was "bewitched by Luo Longji and others" around the time of the "founding of Hong Kong Wenhui Daily" and excluded Communist Party members from Wenhui Daily. After the intellectual ideological transformation study, "the leadership of the Party committee was strengthened, and he felt that there was no work to do, and his mood tended to be depressed; once he was active in work, he wanted to override the Party committee and act arbitrarily." Xu Zhucheng admitted that after the Communist Party's rectification movement began, Wenhui Daily incited anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment. He said that Wenhui Daily played a role of "setting fires everywhere and responding in all directions" when the rightists frantically attacked the people.

Pu Xixiu said in her speech that she wanted to "expose Luo Longji's political conspiracy." She read some excerpts from "three letters Luo Longji gave her in 1950, 1954 and May of this year. Pu Xixiu said that in August and September 1950, she was hesitant to join Mr. Shen Junru's Northwest visiting group or accept Yan Baoli's invitation to work at Shanghai Wenhui Daily. Luo Longji wrote to her asking her to go to Wenhui Daily, saying: "I very much hope that they (referring to Xu Zhucheng and Yan Baoli) can unite and run Wenhui Daily well. This matter is worth their efforts, and I will absolutely stand in a helping position." Luo Longji always wanted to run a publication to promote his views. He once asked me to find a secretary of a capitalist in Hong Kong, wanting this capitalist to pay for a bourgeois magazine. In 1954, when she was in Shanghai, Luo sent her a letter saying: "On the surface, I am always full of energy. Who knows the contradictions in my heart? Everyone says I am active, but only I know that this 'active' is not related to 'creation'." In April of this year, when she was inspecting Heilongjiang, she received a letter from Luo Longji from Beijing saying that a Wenhui Daily reporter interviewed him for his views on the Hundred Schools of Thought. He believed that Wenhui Daily should not chase after the People's Daily. Wenhui Daily originally had its own set of practices, such as film forums, which had already set a trend. Today, it should still think of its own ways; don't do what others do. In the same letter, Luo Longji also said: "I think all the supporting actors (referring to the Communist Party leaders) should change shifts, then thank God. Being as busy as I am, there is absolutely no time to do what I want to do, and I am really unwilling."

Pu Xixiu said that these letters were not all of Luo Longji's letters to her, but "could not be found for a while," and she would continue to "look for" them and hand them over to the rectification group of the China Democratic League. Today is a preliminary expose.

Pu Xixiu said that she thanked the People's Daily for pointing out the formula of "Luo Longji - Pu Xixiu - Wenhui Daily Editorial Department," because "this is indeed an objective fact." However, she did not explain the "facts" of how she took "command" between Luo Longji and the Wenhui Daily Editorial Department.

After Pu Xixiu's speech, Xu Yian of Guangming Daily raised a question: Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng had successively denied at the news work forum that Wenhui Daily accepted Luo Longji's instructions. But according to Wenhui Daily reporter Zhu Jiashu's revelation, Xu Zhucheng admitted this fact in front of many people at a forum of the China Democratic League. Why did Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng avoid talking about what instructions Luo Longji had given them at today's meeting? After the People's Daily published the editorial "Why Is This?" on June 8, Chu Anping immediately resigned from Zhang Bojun. No one else knew about this, how did Pu Xixiu quickly get this news, call Gao Tian of Guangming Daily to ask what the reaction was, and send two reporters to Guangming Daily to watch the wind? Xu Yian said that at a forum of the China Democratic League, Pu Xixiu had expressed to Zhang Bojun that there were a group of old journalists who had not yet been placed, and she was prepared to open a list for Zhang Bojun to use. He asked Pu Xixiu why she did not confess her relationship with Zhang Bojun?

At this time, there were still many people at the meeting who asked to speak to criticize Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng, and a group of people wrote notes to the person in charge of the meeting, asking Pu Xixiu to hand over all the letters that the rightist Luo Longji had given her.

Zhao Chaogou, the president of Shanghai Xinmin Daily, also made a review at today's meeting. He said that the mistakes committed by Xinmin Daily this time were serious, political mistakes, not ordinary ideological mistakes. Some of these mistakes have been confessed, and the newspaper is conducting an in-depth examination. He said: The main lesson learned from this mistake is that the working class's position is unstable, and it cannot distinguish between love and hate. It does not love what the working class loves, and it is not angry with what the working class is angry with, thus making the bourgeois newspaper-running ideology that was once criticized revive in the mind. This bourgeois newspaper-running ideology is manifested in valuing technology and neglecting politics. His main energy this year has been in technical work, with little concern for political ideology. He only seeks to be lively and lively, ignoring the content of the newspaper. Emphasizing the characteristics of the newspaper, weakened the basic direction of the newspaper. He said that although he had the concept of the newspaper being a weapon of class struggle, he did not pay attention to how to use the weapon of class struggle politically. A paralysis gave the bourgeois rightists an opportunity to exploit. Zhao Chaogou also analyzed his erroneous viewpoint of "dogmatism must be opposed, and opportunism is more dangerous." He said that the two should not be mentioned together, but only oppose dogmatism under the premise of opposing opportunism. Dogmatism is a well-intentioned person who does things badly, while opportunism is a matter of position. Zhao Chaogou talked about an important lesson learned from this mistake, which is the issue of accepting the Party's leadership and self-transformation. He expressed that he would accept the Party's leadership ideologically, arm himself with the Party's ideology, and accelerate his own transformation.

Zhang Liqun, the president and editor-in-chief of China Youth Daily, also reviewed his revisionist errors in his speech at the forum on June 5 today. Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The news work forum continued today.

Pu Xixiu Is Playing Two-Faced Tricks

Ye Fu of Teachers' Newspaper was the first to speak. He questioned Pu Xixiu's speech yesterday. Ye Fu said: Under the guidance of Pu Xixiu, the Beijing Office of Wenhui Daily visited Dong Chuncai, the Party Group Secretary of the Ministry of Education, and raised some unreasonable and provocative questions about the current education work, asking Dong Chuncai to answer. And it was planned that Dong Chuncai's answer would be published, and if he did not answer, it would also be published, saying that the Deputy Minister of Education refused to answer. He asked Pu Xixiu what the purpose of this approach was. Ye Fu asked Pu Xixiu, under her leadership, the Beijing Office of Wenhui Daily put forward the slogan "Not afraid of being extreme, not afraid of being one-sided" in organizing manuscripts, what was the intention? Pu Xixiu read some of Luo Longji's letters to her yesterday, but what did Luo Longji talk to her face-to-face? What instructions did he give before going out?

Xu Yian of Guangming Daily exposed Pu Xixiu's two-faced tricks in the anti-rightist struggle at the meeting. Xu Yian said: The Beijing Office of Wenhui Daily has always emphasized using its own special dispatches, but in the anti-rightist struggle, it only sent two special dispatches from the central meeting of the Jiusan Society, and even in these two special dispatches, it did not report the speeches of some people at the meeting who criticized Chu Anping for being anti-Party and anti-socialist. Xu said: The focus of this anti-rightist struggle is the China Democratic League, and Pu is the Deputy Secretary-General and Alternate Central Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, but there is not a single special dispatch reporting the situation of the China Democratic League's anti-rightist struggle. Is this negligence? Absolutely not. What position do Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng occupy in the Zhang-Luo alliance? They should seriously examine whether they are "working together for big things"?

Wang Yunsheng, the president of Dagong Daily, in his speech titled "Educated in the Mistakes Committed by Wenhui Daily," first talked about Zhang Bojun's attempt to control non-Party newspapers and his plan to talk to him. He said: "Zhang Bojun is a monster, really powerful. How did he know that I had opinions on the newspaper's distribution quota and paper supply, and he wanted to use this gap to seize me." Wang Yunsheng said: "Zhang Bojun didn't find me later, probably because he thought I was unreliable!" Then, Wang Yunsheng expressed dissatisfaction with Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu's speeches at yesterday's forum. He said that Xu and Pu were both exposing others, but the responsibility they themselves should bear for Wenhui Daily being used as a tool for the Zhang-Luo alliance to engage in anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities was not thoroughly examined. What position do they occupy in the Zhang-Luo alliance? They should seriously examine whether they are "working together for big things"? He said that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao cherish Wenhui Daily. The Chinese News Workers' Delegation to the Soviet Union also elected Xu Zhucheng as the head of the delegation. How should Xu Zhucheng be inspired to work hard to repay the Party and the people, but he gave the Zhang-Luo alliance a communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist assault and charge warrior. Wang Yunsheng said that Wenhui Daily's layout is usually fancy, with stars all over the sky, sometimes colorful, sometimes smiling, sometimes showing its teeth and claws, but the layout on June 8 was like a widow's face. This is because it felt that the climate was about to change, unwilling to change suddenly, and pretended to be dead for a day. Doesn't this indicate Wenhui Daily's position during this period? Is Xu Zhucheng deceiving people or deceiving God? Wang Yunsheng said that Party cadre Qin Benli went to Wenhui Daily as deputy editor-in-chief, but he had the position but no power. Xu Zhucheng said that he had the position but no power, now it is the Party that has the position but no power in Wenhui Daily. Wang Yunsheng said: "Where the Communist Party's leadership is missing or weakened, there will be a bourgeois orientation."

Wang Yunsheng criticized Xu Zhucheng for putting on the airs of an old journalist, praising himself and showing off his thirty years of newspaper-running experience. Wang Yunsheng used his thirty years of news work experience to deny the so-called old journalist's newspaper-running experience. He said: "What old journalist, old tradition? In the face of truth and great knowledge, there should be a total negation." He believed that the remaining things were only some scattered techniques, which were of course useful. Xu Zhucheng came from Dagong Daily, and his praised "literati running newspapers" came from Zhang Jiluan's "literati discussing politics." Wang Yunsheng said that the "literati discussing politics" at that time was engaged in rotten politics in a rotten China. Who are "literati running newspapers" running newspapers for today? Wang Yunsheng said that he had worked with Zhang Jiluan for many years, and Zhang only told him his heartfelt words at the end: "You write editorials every day, remember this sentence: I have friendship with Mr. Jiang, as long as you support Mr. Jiang, anyone can be criticized." Therefore, during Wang Yunsheng's tenure as the head of Dagong Daily's commentary, he dared to scold anyone, but he did not dare to scold Chiang Kai-shek.

The Two Lines of Rightists Are Connected

One line is: Lu Yi - Gu Zhizhong - Wang Zaoshi One line is: Luo Longji - Pu Xixiu - Wenhui Daily Editorial Department

Zou Fanyang of Shanghai Xinwen Daily, who came to Beijing from Shanghai, revealed the collusion between Lu Yi and Xu Zhucheng, Pu Xixiu, Gu Zhizhong, and others. Lu Yi vigorously promoted Xu Zhucheng's "dismantling the wall" experience of squeezing out Communist Party members in Xinwen Daily, and based on this experience, he drafted a "dismantling the wall" list for Xinwen Daily, including the Party Group Secretary, the General Branch Secretary, the Party member editor, and a non-Party deputy editor-in-chief who was close to the Party. As soon as Xu Zhucheng returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, he cooperated with Lu Yi to attack Jin Zhonghua, the president of Xinwen Daily, saying that Jin Zhonghua's fair remarks at the Shanghai Propaganda Conference were unfair, and blamed Wenhui Daily for not publishing Jin's speech. He himself introduced the "dismantling the wall" experience at the Propaganda Conference. Before speaking, Xu Zhucheng said to Lu outside the conference hall: "Wenhui Daily's experience is an inspiration to Xinwen Daily." Yan Baoli, the deputy editor of Wenhui Daily, also said at the time: "There is no other way to dismantle the wall, only to transfer some Party members away." After Xu Zhucheng spoke, Yan Baoli and Cai Ping of Wenhui Daily took Lu Yi to Tian'ege in a car to discuss how to "dismantle the wall" in Xinwen Daily. Lu Wen, a reporter from Wenhui Daily, spoke at the Shanghai Propaganda Conference to take the lead for Lu Yi, saying, "Please ask our old senior Lu Yi to come out and speak for our reporters." Lu's speech had been read by Lu Yi in advance, and this sentence was also added by Lu Yi. Zou Fanyang said that when the rightists in Shanghai held blooming and contending meetings in various units, they always waited for the Wenhui Daily reporter to arrive before starting the meeting, and they always had to submit the speech to Wenhui Daily for publication. Zou Fanyang also revealed that Lu Yi's activities with the right-wing group in Shanghai were all related to Gu Zhizhong. For example, Lu Yi's relationship with Sun Dayu, Wang Zaoshi, Xu Jie, Chen Zizhan, etc., were all drawn by Gu Zhizhong. During the rectification, Gu Zhizhong also wrote a letter to Lu Yi saying: "I fired a shot in Beijing, and I can hear the shot you fired in Shanghai in Beijing. How is the blooming and contending in Shanghai, have Dayu, Zaoshi, and Wenyin spoken?" He also asked Lu Yi and others to find Shen Yinmo to write articles against the reform of writing. Gu Zhizhong should confess these activities. Zou Fanyang also revealed that Lu Yi sent a reporter to Beijing, instructing the reporter to take the path of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and asked the reporter to "find Teacher Gu (referring to Gu Zhizhong) and Sister Pu (referring to Pu Xixiu), and ask them for advice, and learn about the political climate from them."

Jin Zhonghua, the president of Xinwen Daily, then spoke. He said that the anti-rightist struggle in the news industry is a sharp and fierce political struggle. The rightists took Beijing and Shanghai as their main bases and wanted to seize the propaganda position. Lu Yi became the Shanghai right-wing military adviser. Lu Yi - Gu Zhizhong - Wang Zaoshi is one line, Luo Longji - Pu Xixiu - Wenhui Daily Editorial Department is one line, and these two lines are connected. When Xinwen Daily reporters came to Beijing, Lu Yi always told them to learn from Pu Xixiu. Jin Zhonghua asked Pu Xixiu to thoroughly expose the situation in the middle.

Peng Zigang, who claimed to be a twenty-year old friend of Pu Xixiu, said at the meeting the fact that Pu Xixiu has become more and more anti-Party in recent years. She said that until last week when Pu Xixiu came to her home to ask her to help analyze her mistakes, she had been covering up for Luo Longji, portraying Luo as a person who focused on literary creation in the study. Peng Zigang said: After Chu Anping spoke at the United Front Work Department, Pu Xixiu called Peng Zigang and said that she wanted to ask someone to write an article to analyze Chu Anping's speech. Peng Zigang asked her to find a Party member, and Pu said: "Looking for a Party member, isn't that the same as in the newspaper." Peng Zigang hoped that Pu Xixiu would thoroughly expose Zhang and Luo's attempt to promote a Hungarian-style incident in China and their attempt to restore capitalism. After Peng Zigang spoke, Liu Guanwen of Renmin University, Wang Shanchun of China Youth Daily, and others successively expressed dissatisfaction with her speech, believing that she had not revealed her entire relationship with Pu Xixiu. Gu Zhizhong's Ugly History: Cheating Money, Praising Warlords

Hu Xingyuan, a reporter from Xinwen Daily who once studied and taught at the Minzhi News College, revealed at the meeting that the so-called "old journalist" and "news educator" Gu Zhizhong had close ties with the warlords of Sichuan, Xikang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Gu took a lot of money from these warlords, and then recruited a group of reporters to travel to these places to praise them. The Sichuan warlord also gave him a considerable sum of money to help him go to Europe for "inspection." In the late stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Gu Zhizhong cheated money in the name of restoring "Minzhi New College" on the one hand, and served in the overseas department of the Kuomintang on the other hand, and maintained frequent contact with Chen Bulei and Pan Gongzhan, and was valued by them. Later, he was appointed as the president and editor-in-chief of the Kuomintang India Daily. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he often went to the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang in Chongqing to carry out activities, and once attempted to represent the Kuomintang to take over Shanghai Xinwen Daily. Hu Xingyuan said: Everyone believes that "Minzhi New College" appeared with a progressive face, but this progress only existed when the Party sent Comrade Chen Hanbo to serve as the dean of academic affairs. At this time, in order to please the Kuomintang, Gu Zhizhong also invited Huang Xiangshan, the director of the Kuomintang News Inspection Bureau, to the school to talk about "the role, significance, and necessity of news inspection," and so on.

Neither Pu Xixiu nor Gu Zhizhong attended today's meeting. When the meeting staff accepted everyone's request to call them to attend the meeting, Pu Xixiu said that she was writing materials to be submitted to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. When Gu Zhizhong received a call in the morning, he said that his organizational relationship was in the Jiusan Society, and he had to explain to the Jiusan Society.

    文汇报的民盟右派系统必须彻底揭露
    新闻工作座谈会揭发“罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部”的恶毒活动
    新华社2日讯　在今天继续举行的新闻工作座谈会上，北京、上海等地的新闻工作者列举很多事实，揭露了章罗反动联盟通过浦熙修利用文汇报进行反党、反人民、反社会主义的恶毒活动。
    今天，参加座谈会的约有四百多人，浦熙修、徐铸成出席了会议，并在会上发言。但大家都对他们的发言尤其对浦熙修的发言极为不满，许多人纷纷写条子给主持会的人，要求浦熙修等继续作深刻的检查和交代。
    章罗联盟利用文汇报作为反党工具由来已久
    被徐铸成等从文汇报排挤出来，现在在教师报工作的共产党员张树人揭露章罗同盟和浦熙修把文汇报作为反党工具是由来已久的。张树人说：在宪法草案讨论时，浦熙修交给报社一篇罗隆基写的稿子，并吹嘘他是我国的宪法权威。我们提了不同的意见请他们再考虑，结果罗隆基毫不考虑，还大骂我们和人民日报。去年浦熙修以政协委员名义到山西视察，太原机器厂党委书记向她介绍关于知识分子工作的情况，说到个别干部的错误思想，如说“打天下的不坐，坐天下的不打”，并说这种思想已受到党组织的批评和纠正。但浦熙修把这“材料”供给罗隆基。罗就在去年的全国人民代表大会会议上大放厥词，利用这个“材料”对党进攻和拉拢知识分子。张树人还说到文汇报副社长严宝礼和章伯钧的关系密切，曾向不少人夸耀这关系。他要求严宝礼老老实实交代和章伯钧的关系。张树人在发言中要求徐铸成彻底检查自己反对党的领导、排挤共产党员的行为，进一步交代同罗隆基的关系。
    文汇报的唐海在会上说，文汇报去年10月复刊以来，负责人徐铸成、浦熙修就走罗隆基、章伯钧的路线。在大鸣大放期间，文汇报执行了民盟中央的反动方针。5月中旬以来，徐铸成在报社独断专行，不听中共上海市委的意见，不听报社内党组织的意见，不发表报社内党员写的整风要和风细雨的社论。他认为批评不必谈成绩，鸣放期间不能反批评，不必谈知识分子的改造并抽掉了这方面的文章。唐海还谈到浦熙修所领导的文汇报北京办事处很多报道意图来自民盟中央的章罗反动集团。例如关于知识分子的问题，浦熙修认为熟悉知识分子的只有罗隆基和费孝通两人，罗隆基在政协有关知识分子的发言，她发了很多，并一再要记者写费孝通访问记。浦熙修还常常对一些问题说明“这是罗先生的看法”。有时候，浦熙修不在北京，罗隆基就直接打电话指挥记者。他说，浦熙修直到现在，对于这样严重的错误还没有足够的认识，虽然经报社的同人多次帮助，她还没有把主要问题交代出来。唐海说，文汇报的大多数工作人员都坚决拥护人民日报昨天的社论，准备彻底批判过去一个时候文汇报的错误，并积极参加反右派的斗争。
    中国人民大学新闻系的教员秦明在会上念了他给徐铸成的一封公开信，指出徐铸成的仇视共产党、辱骂共产党员的言论，已经得到台湾敌人的喝采和共鸣。他还叙述了解放前直到现在共产党给文汇报和徐铸成的帮助和支持，质问徐铸成为什么这样忘恩负义、恩将仇报，用文汇报进行反人民的活动。他又说，罗隆基、章伯钧和文汇报至少有八、九年的关系，如果徐铸成还愿意回到人民的社会主义的立场上来，就应该对这些作彻底的揭发。
    人民日报的夏景凡根据文汇报前一个时期的言论、新闻报道和编排方面的材料，批判文汇报执行章罗同盟的反党反人民反社会主义的方针。夏景凡说，中共中央公布整风指示，是要有领导有计划有重点地进行，但文汇报却主张把鸣放立即推向中小学，到处点火，恨不得一下子把火烧起来，唯恐天下不乱。文汇报无休止的夸大工作的缺点，一笔抹杀成绩。如一些新闻标题“浪费青春，埋没人才”，“墙高沟深还隔山”等等。夏景凡说：这是一张什么报纸？有人说，“这是在台湾出版的吧”。夏景凡还揭露文汇报还准备报道胡风的近况。夏景凡说：他们是用对敌人的作法来对付人民。
    徐铸成、浦熙修在会上发言但没有把主要问题交代出来
    接着，徐铸成、浦熙修发言。徐铸成说他读了人民日报7月1日的社论后，“更加清楚认识了章罗同盟反党反社会主义阴谋的毒辣，也更加明白自己被利用对党对人民所犯错误的严重。”徐铸成说：文汇报北京办事处虽然有个编委会，但浦熙修有事不找编委商量，而找罗隆基、章伯钧。文汇报去年筹备复刊时，和教师报的关系搞得很不好，罗隆基首先对我们说，文汇报复刊要抓紧时间，否则就不行了。后来又通过浦熙修对我们说，教师报找不到干部，成心要把你们拖到明年，你们一定要争取主动。去年筹备文汇报最紧张的时候，浦熙修到北戴河去了一个多星期，说是和罗隆基约好了的。大家知道，章罗反党联盟就是那次去北戴河搞起来的。徐铸成说，他检查了文汇报为何会被章、罗利用的原因，他认为根子是他的“立场问题”、是他“对党的态度问题”。徐铸成说，在解放前，党就关怀和支持文汇报，但他和党员之间一直保持距离。原因是他“热心于把文汇报办成‘超然’的民间报”，解放后他“还在做办民间报的迷梦”。由于“办民间报”的立场，徐铸成在“香港文汇报创刊前后”就“受了罗隆基等的蛊惑”，排斥在文汇报的共产党员。在知识分子思想改造学习以后，“党委领导加强了，就感觉没有工作可做，情绪趋于消沉；一旦工作积极了，就想凌驾党委上面而独断独行。”徐铸成承认在共产党整风运动开始后，文汇报煽动反党反社会主义情绪。他说文汇报在右派分子猖狂地向人民进攻的时候，起了“到处点火，八方呼应的作用”。
    浦熙修发言时说要“揭发罗隆基的政治阴谋”。她在会上念了“罗隆基在1950年、1954年和今年5月间给她的三封信中的一些片断。浦熙修说，1950年8、9月间，她正在迟疑于随沈钧儒老先生参加西北访问团还是应严宝礼的邀约到上海文汇报工作，罗隆基来信要她去文汇报，并说：“我十分希望他们（指徐铸成、严宝礼）能够团结，能够把文汇报搞好，这事值得他们努力，我绝对站在帮忙的地位”。罗隆基始终想办个刊物来宣传他的主张，他曾经要我去找一个在香港的资本家的秘书，想要这个资本家出钱来办一个资产阶级的杂志。1954年她在上海时，罗给她去信说：“表面上我总是一股子劲，谁又知道我心窝里的矛盾呢？逢人都说我积极，只有我自己知道，这‘积极’与‘创造’是不相干的。”今年4月间她在黑龙江视察，接到罗隆基自北京的来信说，文汇报的记者采访他对百家争鸣的意见，他认为文汇报不要在人民日报后面追赶。文汇报原来有自己一套做法，例如电影座谈等等，已开风气之先。今天还应自想办法；不要别人做什么，你们亦做什么。同信中罗隆基还说：“我以为所有跑龙套人（指共产党的领导人）都换换班，那就谢天谢地。像我这样无事忙，绝对没有时间做一点自己想做的事，真不甘心。”
    浦熙修说，这些信不是罗隆基给她的信的全部，但“一时还找不出来”，她将继续“寻找”，交给盟中央整风小组，今天是初步揭发。
    浦熙修说，她感谢人民日报指出了“罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部”的公式，因为“这确是一个客观事实”。但她并没有交代她在罗隆基和文汇报编辑部之间如何挂“帅”的“事实”。
    光明日报徐亦安在浦熙修发言以后提出质问：浦熙修和徐铸成曾先后在新闻工作座谈会否认文汇报接受罗隆基的指示。但据文汇报记者朱嘉树揭露，徐铸成在民盟一个座谈会上，当着许多人的面承认了这个事实，为什么浦熙修和徐铸成在今天的会上对罗隆基究竟作了什么指示却避而不谈？6月8日人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论以后，储安平即向章伯钧辞职。这件事别人都不知道，浦熙修怎么很快就得到这个消息，打电话问光明日报的高天有什么反映，并派两个记者到光明日报观看风色。徐亦安说，浦熙修在民盟一个座谈会上，曾向章伯钧表示，有一批老报人还没有安置，她准备开一个名单请章伯钧使用。他问浦熙修为什么不交代她和章伯钧的关系？
    这时候，会场还有很多人要求发言批判浦熙修、徐铸成，并有一群人写条子给主持会的人要求浦熙修把右派分子罗隆基给她的信全部交出来。
    上海新民报社长赵超构也在今天的会上作了检讨。他说，新民报这次所犯的错误是严重的，是政治性的错误，不是平常的思想错误。这些错误一部分已作交代，报社正在深入检查。他说：从这次错误中所获得的教训，主要是工人阶级立场不稳，爱憎不分明，不是喜工人阶级之所喜，怒工人阶级之所怒，因而使得一度批判过的资产阶级办报思想在脑子里复辟。这种资产阶级办报思想表现为重技术轻政治。他一年来主要力量在搞技术工作，对政治思想关心很少，只求生动活泼，忽视报纸内容。强调报纸特点，削弱了报纸基本方向。他说，对报纸是阶级斗争的武器，虽然有过概念，但没有重视怎样从政治上发挥阶级斗争武器的作用。一麻痹就为资产阶级右派分子钻了空子。赵超构还分析了他的“教条主义要反，机会主义更危险”的错误论点。他说，两者不能并提，只能在反机会主义的前提下反教条，教条主义是好心人把事办坏了，机会主义则是立场问题。赵超构谈到从这次错误中接受的一个重要教训是接受党的领导和自我改造问题。他表示要从思想上接受党的领导，并且用党的思想武装自己，加紧改造自己。
    中国青年报社长兼总编辑张黎群，今天也在会上检讨了他在6月5日的座谈会上发言中修正主义的错误。新华社3日讯　新闻工作座谈会今天继续举行。
    浦熙修在玩弄两面手法
    教师报的叶夫第一个发言，他对浦熙修昨天的发言提出质问。叶夫话：文汇报北京办事处在浦熙修指导下访问了教育部党组书记董纯才，对当前教育工作提出一些无理的挑拨性的问题，请董纯才答复。并且打算董纯才答复也见报，不答复也见报，说教育部副部长拒绝答复。他问浦熙修这种做法的目的何在。叶夫问浦熙修，在她领导下的文汇报北京办事处在组织稿件中提出“不怕偏激，不怕片面”的口号，居心何在？浦熙修昨天读了罗隆基给她的部分信件，但罗隆基和她面谈了些什么？出门前作了些什么指示？
    光明日报徐亦安在会上揭发了浦熙修在反右派斗争中所玩弄的两面手法。徐亦安说：文汇报北京办事处向来是强调用自己专电的，但在反右派的斗争中它只发了九三学社中央开会的两条专电，而且就是在这两条专电里，也没有把会上有人批判储安平反党反社会主义的发言报道出来。徐说：这次反右派斗争的重点是民盟，浦是民盟北京市委员会副秘书长和候补中委，但对民盟反右派斗争的情形却没有一个专电报道，这是疏忽吗？决不是的。浦熙修、徐铸成在章罗联盟里究竟处在什么地位？应该认真检查
    大公报社长王芸生在题为“在文汇报所犯的错误中受教育”的发言中，首先谈到章伯钧企图控制党外报纸，打算找他谈谈。他说：“章伯钧是一个妖怪，真厉害。他怎么知道我对报纸发行定额和纸张供应有意见，他就想利用这个缺口来抓住我。”王芸生说：“章伯钧后来没有找我，大概是认为我不可靠吧！”接着，王芸生对徐铸成、浦熙修在昨天座谈会上的发言，表示不满。他说，徐、浦发言都在揭露别人，但对文汇报被用为章罗联盟进行反党反人民反社会主义的工具他们自己应负的责任检查很不够。他们在章罗联盟里究竟处在什么地位？应该认真检查，是不是“同心共大事”呢？他说，共产党、毛主席是爱护文汇报的。中国新闻工作者访苏代表团又推徐铸成为团长。徐铸成应当怎样感奋努力，报答党报答人民，但他却给章罗联盟作反共反人民反社会主义冲锋陷阵的战士。王芸生说，文汇报平日版面花巧，搞得满天星斗，有时花枝招展，有时眉开眼笑，有时张牙舞爪，而6月8日的版面却是一付寡妇面孔。这是预感到气候要变了，不甘心突变，且装一天死，难道这不表示文汇报在这一时期的立场吗？徐铸成是在欺人乎，欺天乎。王芸生说，党员干部钦本立到文汇报担任副总编辑，但有职无权。徐铸成说自己有职无权，现在是党在文汇报有职无权了。王芸生说：“哪里没有了或削弱了共产党的领导，那里就闹资产阶级方向”。
    王芸生在会上批判了徐铸成摆老报人的架子，自赞自叹地卖弄三十年办报经验。王芸生以自己三十年出头的新闻工作经验，来否定所谓老报人的办报经验。他说：“什么老报人、旧传统？在真理和大学问面前，应该作总的否定。”他认为剩下的一些东西，只是些零零碎碎的技术，这当然也是有用的。徐铸成出身于大公报，他所称道的“文人办报”，出典于张季鸾的“文人论政”。王芸生说，那时的“文人论政”是在烂中国里搞烂政治。今天“文人办报”是给谁办报？王芸生说，他和张季鸾共事多年，到最后张才向他说知心话：“你天天写社论，要记住这句话：我跟蒋先生有交情，只要拥护蒋先生，任何人都可以批评。”所以王芸生主持大公报言论时期，什么人都敢骂，就是不敢骂蒋介石。
    右派分子两条线脉络相通
    一条线是：陆诒——顾执中——王造时一条线是：罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部
    从上海来北京的新闻日报的邹凡扬，揭露了陆诒和徐铸成、浦熙修、顾执中等人之间的串连关系。陆诒在新闻日报大肆宣传徐铸成排挤共产党员的“拆墙”经验，并根据这种经验拟出了新闻日报的“拆墙”名单，其中包括党组书记、总支书记、党员编委和一个靠拢党的非党副总编辑。徐铸成一从苏联访问回来，就配合陆诒攻击新闻日报社长金仲华，说金仲华在上海宣传会议上的持平之论为不公道，责备文汇报不该发金的发言。他自己又在宣传会议上介绍“拆墙”经验。发言前，徐铸成在会场门外曾对陆说：“文汇报的经验，对新闻日报是一种启发。”文汇报副社长严宝礼当时也说：“拆墙没有旁的办法，只有把一些党员调开。”徐铸成发言后，严宝礼和文汇报的蔡平又用小汽车接陆诒到天鹅阁吃饭，商量在新闻日报如何“拆墙”。文汇报记者吕文在上海宣传会议上发言替陆诒打先锋，说“请我们的老前辈陆诒出来为我们记者讲话”。吕的发言陆诒事先看过，并且这句话也是陆诒加的。邹凡扬说，上海的右派分子们在各单位搞鸣放大会时，总要等文汇报记者到场再开会，并且总是要把发言稿交文汇报发表。邹凡扬还揭露陆诒在上海和右派集团的活动都和顾执中有关，如陆诒和孙大雨、王造时、许杰、陈子展等的关系，就都是顾执中拉拢的。整风中顾执中还写信给陆诒说：“我在北京放了一炮，你在上海放的炮我在北京也听得见。上海鸣放如何，大雨、造时、文应等发言没有？”他还要陆诒等找沈尹默写文章反对文字改革。顾执中应该交代这些活动。邹凡扬还揭露陆诒派一个记者到北京来，指示这个记者要走章伯钧、罗隆基的门路，并要这记者“找顾老师（指顾执中）、浦二姐（指浦熙修），多向他们讨教，从他们那里了解政治气候。
    新闻日报社长金仲华接着发言。他说，新闻界反右派斗争是一场尖锐剧烈的政治斗争。右派分子以北京、上海为主要基地，想夺取宣传阵地。陆诒成为上海右派军师。陆诒—顾执中—王造时是一条线，罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部是一条线，这两条线脉络相通。新闻日报有记者到北京来的时候，陆诒总是叫他们要向浦熙修学习。金仲华要浦熙修彻底揭发这中间的情形。
    自称和浦熙修曾经是二十年老朋友的彭子冈在会上说浦熙修最近几年越来越走向反党立场的事实。她说直到上星期浦熙修到她家里找她帮助分析自己的错误时，还一直在为罗隆基打掩护，把罗描写成一个专心在书斋里搞文艺创作的人。彭子冈说：当储安平在统战部发言后，浦熙修给彭子冈打电话说要约人写文章分析储安平的发言。彭子冈让她找一个党员，浦说：“找党员，那还不和报纸上一样。”彭子冈希望浦熙修好好揭露章罗妄想在中国促成匈牙利性质的事件、妄想复辟资本主义的企图。彭子冈发言后，人民大学刘贯文、中国青年报王善淳等相继对她的发言表示不满，认为她没有把她和浦熙修的全部关系揭露出来。顾执中的丑史：骗诈钱财，为军阀吹嘘
    曾经在民治新闻专科学校学习和担任教员的新闻日报记者胡星源，在会上揭发了所谓“老报人”、“新闻教育家”的顾执中，在抗日战争以前曾与四川、西康、广东、广西等省的军阀有密切联系。顾拿过这些军阀不少的钱，然后拉拢一批记者到这些地方旅行，替他们吹嘘。四川军阀还给他一笔数目可观的钱资助他到欧洲去“考察”。抗日战争后期，顾执中一面借恢复“民治新专”为名骗诈钱财，一面在国民党海外部担任职务，和陈布雷、潘公展经常保持联系，并且得到他们的重视，后来被任命为国民党印度日报社社长兼总编辑。抗战结束后，他在重庆时经常到国民党中央宣传部活动，并曾企图代表国民党去接收上海新闻报。胡星源说：大家都认为“民治新专”是以进步面貌出现的，但这种进步仅仅是在党派了陈翰伯同志去任教务长的时候才有的，就在这个时候，顾执中为了讨好国民党，还请了国民党新闻检查局的处长黄香山到学校讲“新闻检查的作用、意义和必要”等。
    浦熙修、顾执中都没有出席今天的会议，当会议工作人员接受大家要求打电话叫他们来参加会时，浦熙修说她正在写向民盟中央交代的材料。顾执中在上午接到电话时说，他的组织关系在九三学社，要向九三学社去交代。
