Lessons from "Going It Alone" and "Seeking Completeness"
By Our Correspondent Lǐ Qiàn

    Xi'an, an ancient city with a brilliant cultural history, has been transformed into a new industrial city after the construction during the First Five-Year Plan. In the vicinity of this city, there have emerged thirty to forty modern factories, including large machinery plants, electrical factories, instrument factories, textile mills, printing and dyeing plants, as well as metal structure factories and large permanent prefabrication plants serving as construction bases. People who come to Xi'an cannot help but be encouraged by this rapidly developing industrial construction. However, due to a lack of construction experience in the past, the relevant departments did not conduct unified planning for these enterprises, and some leaders, greedy for the convenience of their own units and departments, blindly sought completeness and were happy to "go it alone," failing to effectively implement the spirit of collaboration in construction. Many factories were doing their own thing, resulting in a waste of national funds and some unreasonable phenomena in production.

    Insufficient attention to collaboration in industrial construction is first manifested between state-owned factories and local factories, as well as between factories under different ministries. When we visited some wood processing factories in the Xi'an area, we often heard factory leaders say that there were insufficient production tasks and low utilization rates of machinery and equipment. What was the reason? It turned out that the wood processing capacity in the Xi'an area was too large. The two wood processing plants under the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Xi'an Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau alone had an annual sawing capacity of over 240,000 cubic meters and a door and window production capacity of approximately 390,000 cubic meters; in addition, various construction companies had eight carpentry workshops. These wood processing plants were frequently "underfed." For example, the Northwest Engineering Bureau's processing plant had an annual sawing capacity of 180,000 cubic meters, but even in the busiest year last year, it only had 80,000 cubic meters of production tasks, and this year's task is only 20,000 cubic meters. These wood processing plants already have a large amount of idle labor, but some newly built state-owned factories have almost all built their own carpentry workshops separately. These newly built carpentry workshops have also created a large amount of idle labor. This is not only the case in wood processing, but also in ferrous metal castings and other areas.

    The shortcomings of insufficient attention to collaboration also seriously exist between factories under the same ministry. The eleven factories of the Second Ministry of Machine Building in Xi'an are generally not far from each other, with several factories only a few hundred meters apart, which is a good condition for mutual cooperation in production. However, almost every factory now has a woodworking workshop, a machine repair workshop, an oxygen station, a fire truck garage, a dedicated railway line, and a tool workshop. At present, ten woodworking workshops have been built, with a total area of more than 37,000 square meters, one of which has a construction area of more than 11,000 square meters. These woodworking workshops are not only large in construction area, but also highly mechanized; even the removal of shavings and sawdust is done by machines from underground. The construction of such woodworking workshops by each factory naturally creates a backlog of manpower and equipment.

    Within a factory, there are also problems with collaboration between workshops in some factories. Some newly built machinery factories originally had machine repair workshops, but each production workshop also had a machine repair section, and there was also a machine repair section in the machine repair workshop, for the purpose of repairing the machinery in the machine repair workshop. The Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Factory originally had two large, factory-wide laboratories, but each workshop also had laboratories, with one workshop having as many as eighteen laboratories of various sizes. In fact, many laboratories are of the same or similar nature and could be merged.

    The result of building these state-owned factories as "all-around" factories is that many unreasonable phenomena have emerged in production. One of the more prominent problems is the low utilization rate of equipment. In the machine repair workshops of the newly built machinery factories and electrical factories in Xi'an, there are several of every piece of machinery and equipment that might be used; some large and precision machine tools are rarely used once or twice a year, and some have a utilization rate as low as 3% or 4%. The head of one machinery factory told us that the machine repair workshop in this factory was designed with the workload of major repairs as the highest processing capacity of the machine repair workshop. Now all the machines have been installed, but the factory has just been built, and the machines in the production workshops are also new, so not only will major repair equipment not be used for two or three years, but even medium repair equipment will not be used much, so the equipment has to sit idle.

    Due to the lack of collaborative construction, the accumulation and waste of manpower is quite serious. A machinery factory built its own dedicated railway line and equipped it with a set of railway transportation personnel, including a stationmaster, train drivers, dispatchers, repair workers, and coupling workers, a total of more than twenty people. The transportation volume of this factory is not large; even after it is officially put into production, it will only have ten truckloads of transportation per day. Because these railway personnel have nothing to do, many people are not at ease in their work. This factory also has its own forty-plus firefighters, who also have nothing to do except for fire drill exercises. Several nearby newly built machinery factories also have their own dedicated railway lines and firefighters, some with even larger establishments than this factory.

    Due to the low utilization rate of machinery and the large staffing, it is bound to lead to the shortcomings of low labor productivity and high product costs. At the same time, due to the large staffing, the factory's dormitories and other welfare facilities will also have to be increased accordingly. Therefore, it not only increases the state's investment, but also affects the factory's ability to create more wealth for the country.

    Not long ago, the State Construction Commission, the State Economic Commission, and the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry, and other units sent leaders to Xi'an to inspect the factory construction work in the Xi'an area during the First Five-Year Plan, and together with the leaders of these factories, studied how to organize collaborative factory construction in accordance with the spirit of diligence and thrift in building the country. They believe that all auxiliary workshops, laboratories, and other facilities that can be used jointly by several factories should be used jointly as much as possible. Now, some machinery factories have decided to use a woodworking workshop jointly by two factories or three or four factories; they have decided to stop building non-ferrous metal casting workshops in several factories and entrust the production tasks to already-built brother factories. Those auxiliary workshops that are not needed will be converted for use as other workshops, and the equipment that is not needed will be used to support other factories.

    At present, many factories in the Xi'an area have begun to pay attention to collaborative factory construction, but there are still many problems in collaboration.

    The first is how to organize the collaborative work between factories belonging to different industrial ministries, between state-owned factories and local factories? This problem has not been well resolved. Recently, the Xi'an Municipal Construction Commission and Planning Commission have begun to pay attention to the work of organizing collaborative factory construction, and have successively convened some newly built factories to study the collaborative problems of ferrous metal castings, non-ferrous metal castings, and oxygen stations. However, because these problems involve a wide range, and some factories excessively emphasize the particularity of their own production and are unwilling to collaborate with other factories, and because the Xi'an Municipal Construction Commission itself cannot fully grasp the production situation of various state-owned factories, the problem has not been resolved after several meetings.

    Another problem in collaboration is that some factory leaders have not yet sufficiently recognized the important significance of collaborative factory construction for saving national construction funds and improving production efficiency, and therefore excessively emphasize the difficulties of collaboration and still want to do everything on their own. For example, there are four or five cotton textile mills and a printing and dyeing plant built together in Xi'an, and several factories are under the leadership of the same industrial ministry and have the same production nature, so there are many favorable conditions for organizing collaboration. However, the construction of these factories is completely separate. These factories, which are only a wall apart, each have their own boilers, machine repair workshops, fire equipment, and firefighters, and therefore also have idle labor and waste. However, no one has raised the issue of collaboration until now. Even some factories have surplus steam and water and can completely supply them to neighboring factories, but one factory thinks the calculated price is too high, and the other factory is afraid of trouble, so they still do their own thing.

    The "going it alone" and "seeking completeness" of some newly built factories in Xi'an, and the lack of attention to collaborative factory construction, have already provided many painful lessons. Now is the time to learn from these lessons and earnestly do a good job in collaborative work!

    “单干”“求全”的教训
    本报记者  李茜
    有着灿烂文化历史的古城西安，经过第一个五年计划期间的建设，已经变成了新的工业城市。在这个城市的近郊，已经出现了三、四十个现代化的工厂，其中有大型机械厂、电工厂、仪表厂、纺织厂、印染厂，也有作为建筑基地的金属结构厂和永久性的大型预制厂。来到西安的人们，没有不被这迅速发展的工业建设所鼓舞的。但是，由于过去缺乏建设经验，有关部门对这些企业没有很好地进行统一规划，再加上某些领导人员贪图本单位、本部门的方便，盲目求全，乐意“单干”，因而在建设中没有很好地贯彻协作的精神。许多厂都是各搞一套，结果浪费了国家不少资金，同时造成了生产中的一些不合理的现象。
    工业建设中注意协作不够，首先表现在国营工厂和地方工厂之间，以及这个部所属的工厂和那个部所属的工厂之间。当我们访问西安地区一些木材加工厂的时候，常常听到厂里领导人员说生产任务不足，机械设备利用率不高。原因何在呢？原来西安地区的木材加工能力过大了。仅建筑工程部西北工程管理总局和西安市建筑工程局所属的两个木材加工厂，每年锯材能力就有二十四万多立方公尺，门窗制作能力约三十九万立方公尺；另外各建筑公司还有八个木工车间。这些木材加工厂都经常“吃不饱”。例如，西北工程总局的加工厂每年的锯材能力是十八万立方公尺，去年是生产任务最紧张的一年，也只有八万立方公尺的生产任务，今年的任务才只有两万立方公尺。这些木材加工厂已是大量窝工，但是新建的一些国营工厂却差不多都另外建筑了自己的木工车间。这些新建成的木工车间，又形成了大量窝工的现象。不仅木材加工方面如此，黑色金属铸件等方面也有类似情况。
    注意协作不够的缺点，在同一个部所属各厂之间也严重存在。第二机械工业部在西安的十一个厂，厂址距离一般都不远，有几个厂相距只有几百公尺，这本来是生产中互相协作的好条件。但是，现在几乎每个厂都设计有木工车间、机修车间、氧气站、消防车库、铁路专用线和工具车间。目前，仅木工车间就已经建成了十个，总面积达三万七千多平方公尺，其中有一个厂的木工车间建筑面积有一万一千多平方公尺。这些木工车间不但建筑面积大，机械化程度也非常高，连清除刨花和锯末等废料，也是用机器从地下抽出去。各厂都建了这样的木工车间，自然形成人力和设备的积压。
    在一个工厂内部，车间与车间的协作，有些厂里也存在问题。有些新建的机械工厂本来都有机修车间，但是每个生产车间又都设有机修工段，而且在机修车间内也有一个机修工段，为的是修理机修车间的机械。西安高压开关厂本来已经有两个全厂性的大实验室，可是每个厂房内又都设有实验室，其中一个厂房竟有大小十八个实验室。实际上，不少实验室的性质是相同的或相类似的，完全可以合并起来建设。
    这些国营工厂按照“全能”厂进行建设的结果，使生产中出现了许多不合理的现象。其中比较突出的一个问题，是设备利用率低。西安新建的各个机械厂和电工厂的机修车间里，凡是可能用到的机械设备就都有几台；有些大型精密的机床一年不准用上一两次，有的利用率低到3％、4％。有一个机械厂的负责人告诉我们说，这个厂的机修车间里把大修时的工作量当作机修车间最高加工能力进行设计的，现在全部机器都安装起来了，但是工厂刚刚建成，生产车间的机器也都是新的，两三年内不仅用不到大修设备，连中修设备用到的也不多，所以设备只好闲着。
    由于没有协作建厂，人力的积压和浪费相当严重。有个机械厂自己单独建设了铁路专用线，配备了一套铁路运输人员，其中有车站站长、火车司机、调度人员、修理工人和挂钩工人等，共二十多名。这个厂的运输量并不大，正式投入生产以后，每天也不过有十个车皮的运输量。这些铁路人员因为无事可作，不少人都不安心工作。这个厂还自己配备了四十多名消防人员，这些人平常除了作救火练习以外，也是无事可作。附近几个新建的机械厂，也同样设有自己的铁路专用线和消防人员，有的编制比这个厂还要大。
    由于机械利用率低和人员编制大，势必就造成劳动生产率低和产品成本高等缺点。同时，由于人员编制大，工厂的宿舍和其他福利设施也要随着增加。因此，既增加了国家的投资，也影响了工厂为国家创造更多的财富。
    不久以前，国家建设委员会、国家经济委员会和第二机械工业部、电机工业部等单位派领导人员来西安，检查了第一个五年计划期间在西安地区的建厂工作，并且同这些厂的领导人员一起，研究了如何按照勤俭建国的精神组织协作建厂。他们认为，凡是能够几个厂共同使用的辅助车间、实验室和其他设施，都应该尽量共同使用。现在，有些机械工厂已经决定两个厂或者三、四个厂合用一个木工车间；决定停建几个厂有色金属铸造车间，把生产任务交由已建成的兄弟厂承担。那些用不上的辅助车间，将改作其他车间使用，用不着的设备将支援其他工厂。
    目前，西安地区有不少工厂已经开始注意协作建厂，但是在协作中还存在着不少问题。
    首先是属于不同工业部的工厂之间、国营工厂与地方工厂之间的协作工作如何组织？这个问题还没有很好地解决。最近西安市建委、计委都开始注意了组织协作建厂的工作，并且先后召集一些新建厂研究了黑色金属铸件、有色金属铸件以及氧气站的协作问题。但是，由于这些问题牵扯面广，有的厂又过分强调自己生产的特殊性，不愿同其他厂协作，再加上西安市建委本身又不能完全掌握各国营厂的生产情况，因此，开过几次会，问题还不能解决。
    协作中另外一个问题，是有一些厂的领导人员还没有足够地认识到协作建厂对节约国家建设资金和提高生产效率的重要意义，因而过分地强调协作的困难，还想事事都各搞一套。例如，西安有四、五个棉纺织厂和一个印染厂建设在一起，几个厂都是属于同一个工业部领导，生产性质又相同，组织协作本来有很多便利条件。但是，这几个厂的建设完全是各搞一套。这几个只有一墙之隔的工厂，各自都有锅炉、机修车间、消防设备和消防人员，因而也都有窝工浪费现象。但是，直到现在也还没有人提出协作的问题。甚至有的厂蒸汽和水有富余，完全可以供给邻厂使用，但是一个厂嫌计算的价钱高，另一个厂也怕麻烦，结果还是各搞各的。
    西安一些新建工厂“单干”“求全”，不注意协作建厂，已有不少沉重的教训。现在是吸取这些教训，认真搞好协作工作的时候了！
