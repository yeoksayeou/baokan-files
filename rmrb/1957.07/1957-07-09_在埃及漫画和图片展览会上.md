At the Exhibition of Egyptian Cartoons and Pictures
    Feng Zhidan
    For those who have not had the opportunity to visit Egypt but wish to further understand the fighting Egypt, a visit to the Exhibition of Egyptian Resistance Cartoons and Pictures held at the Beijing Library will be rewarding. This exhibition is jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association and officially opened on July 5.
    On the morning of July 5, Egyptian Ambassador to China Hassan Ragab and his wife, as well as peace representatives from Arab countries attending the Colombo World Peace Council meeting visiting China, visited the exhibition. They met many students from Peking University, staff members from government organizations, artists, and journalists there.
    Accompanied by Cai Tingkai, a member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Ambassador Ragab carefully viewed the pictures. Of course, Ambassador Ragab is very familiar with his motherland; he seemed to be receiving Chinese friends in his own country. As he looked, he explained to everyone, as if truly leading the visitors to Egypt, this beautiful country.
    On the Nile, the scenery is picturesque: the shadows of trees are reflected in the tranquil water, and a white sail is gently sailing into the distance. The night view of the Ismailia Bridge seen from the Semiramis Hotel, with beautiful fireworks scattered from the sky. Cairo, this magnificent and beautiful city, is presented before everyone's eyes: the fountain in Liberation Square spraying golden water in the sunlight; the bustling 26th of July Street, the grand Cairo University, Farouk's Abdin Palace, the domed mosques... It is truly a dazzling array. Egyptian athletes compete in sports fields, the Egyptian army marches majestically, and people work busily on the Suez Canal. Ambassador Ragab particularly pointed out to everyone that the building with the dome is the headquarters of the Suez Canal Company.
    Looking at the rural life of Egypt, it is also full of fighting scenes. Wheat is harvested, sugarcane is reaped. Male farmers carry hoes, and female farmers carry water jars on their heads. An old farmer with a wrinkled face grabs a handful of soil in the field, his eyes filled with love for his hometown and land, as if saying: "How fragrant and fertile is the soil of our motherland!" Another farmer carries a hoe; this is a copperplate painting created by the famous Egyptian painter Hassan. This Egyptian farmer swears with the fire in his eyes: "I will defend my motherland!"
    Many of the works by Egyptian cartoonists displayed at the exhibition are very meaningful. They show that the Egyptian people love peace and hate imperialist warmongers. One cartoon is:
  "Uncle Sam's Hobby." An American is playing a strange game of marbles, but he is using bombs to hit the Earth. A cartoon titled "Jordan's New Policy" and another titled "Mossadegh in Prison" are of profound significance for countries striving for and safeguarding their national independence. The former depicts a Jordanian man wrapped in a headscarf, glaring angrily at Egypt across the sea, but the American imperialist bayonet stabs this Jordanian man from behind. This shows that the new Jordanian government has mistaken its enemy, and its attitude unfavorable to Arab unity can only give the United States an opportunity to invade Jordan. The latter depicts former Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh imprisoned in a prison built of dollars and pounds, deeply contemplating. Because he did not have enough vigilance against imperialist conspiracies, his nationalist regime was overthrown by American agents. However, the Egyptian people vigilantly defend the peace and security of their motherland. One painting is: a giant representing the Egyptian people is fighting against the imperialist demons. Another painting is: Egyptian President Nasser is leading the Egyptian people together on the road to peace and national independence.
    In the gallery of this exhibition hall, you can also see Port Said, disfigured by the burning of the Anglo-French invading forces, and you can also see the Egyptian people who bravely resisted the Anglo-French invaders. We lingered in this gallery as if we were on the land of Egypt, breathing the air breathed by the Egyptians, and drinking the water of the Nile with them.
    On the morning of July 5, the gallery of this exhibition was also filled with the vivid friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people. Here are displayed the Arabic translations of Chairman Mao Zedong's works on guerrilla warfare and his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, as well as "Memories of Lu Xun" written by Arab writers. What attracts the most attention is the Chinese painting: Chrysanthemums, painted by the wife of the Egyptian Ambassador, Sinabo.
    In this gallery of friendship, the Egyptian painter Hassan and the Chinese painter Wu Zuoren talked to each other. They were discussing Hassan's copperplate painting "I Want to Defend My Motherland" and took a group photo together. In addition, Oumonam, an Egyptian student studying Chinese at Peking University, also talked cordially with students majoring in Arabic at Peking University about everything in Egypt. Oumonam has only been in China for more than half a year, but he can already speak some Chinese with difficulty. He enthusiastically told reporters that he aspires to engage in the translation of Chinese and Arabic literary works.
    Ambassador Ragab was very satisfied with the exhibition. He told reporters: "This exhibition is extremely well organized. It conveys the modern spirit of the Egyptian people. No matter how insidious the imperialists are, the Egyptian people will resolutely unite around President Nasser and move towards a bright future!" (Attached picture)

### 在埃及漫画和图片展览会上

    在埃及漫画和图片展览会上
    冯之丹
    没有机会到埃及去进行访问的人，如果想对战斗着的埃及有进一步的了解，那么请到北京图书馆去参观一下在那里举行的埃及抗战漫画与图片展览会，是会有收获的。这个展览会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中埃友好协会联合主办的，已于7月5日正式揭幕。
    7月5日上午，埃及驻华大使哈桑·拉加卜和夫人，以及来中国访问的出席科伦坡世界和平理事会会议的阿拉伯国家和平代表都参观了这个展览会。他们在那里遇到了许多北京大学的学生、机关工作人员、艺术家、新闻记者。
    拉加卜大使在中国人民保卫世界和平委员会委员蔡廷锴的陪同下，很仔细地参观这些图片。当然，拉加卜大使很熟悉他的祖国，他好像是在自己的国家接待着中国朋友。他一面看，一面向大家讲解，仿佛把参观者真的引到了埃及，这个美丽的国家。
    尼罗河上，风景如画：树影翳翳地倒映在宁静的水中，一片白帆正在轻轻地驶向远方。从赛米拉密斯大旅馆望见伊斯迈耶尔桥上的夜景，美丽的焰火从高空散落下来。开罗，这座雄伟而美丽的城市展现在大家的眼前了：解放广场上的喷泉在阳光下喷出金光闪闪的水花；繁华的7月26日大街，宏大的开罗大学，法鲁克的阿勃丁宫，圆堡式的清真寺……真是琳琅满目。埃及的男女健儿在运动场上竞赛，埃及军队在威武地行进，苏伊士运河上人们在繁忙地工作着。拉加卜大使特别向大家指出，那座带有圆堡的建筑，就是苏伊士运河公司的总部。
    看一看埃及的农村生活，同样充满着战斗的情景。小麦丰收了，甘蔗收割了。男农民扛着锄头，农妇的头上顶着水坛。一个满脸皱纹的老农在田野间抓起一把泥土，他的眼睛里充满着对家乡和土地的热爱，他仿佛是在说：“我们祖国的泥土是多么芳香而肥沃！”另一个农民扛着锄头，这是埃及著名画家哈森创作的一幅铜版画。这个埃及农民用眼睛里的怒火宣誓：“我要保卫我的祖国！”
    展览会上陈列着的许多埃及漫画家的作品，都是很有意义的。它们表明，埃及人民是爱好和平和憎恨帝国主义战争贩子的。有一张漫画是：
  “山姆大叔的嗜好”。美国人在打着一种奇怪的弹子球，原来他是用炸弹去打地球的。有一幅题为“约旦的新政策”和另一幅题为“监狱中的摩萨台”的漫画，对于正在争取和维护自己民族独立的国家富有深刻意义。前一幅画着一个裹着头巾的约旦人，他隔海而怒视着埃及，但美国帝国主义的刺刀却从背后刺向这个约旦人。这说明，约旦新政府把敌人找错了，它的不利于阿拉伯国家团结的态度，只能使美国得到侵入约旦的机会。后一幅画着伊朗前首相摩萨台被囚禁在美元和英镑筑成的牢狱里，他在深沉地思索。由于他对于帝国主义的阴谋没有足够的警惕，因而他的民族主义政权被美国代理人推翻了。但是，埃及人民警惕地捍卫着自己祖国的和平与安全。有一幅画是：一个巨人代表着埃及人民正在向帝国主义的魔鬼进行着搏斗。另一幅画是：埃及纳赛尔总统领导着埃及人民共同走上和平与民族独立的大道。
    在这个展览室的画廊上，你还可以看到被英法侵略军焚毁的面目全非的塞得港，也可以看到英勇地抗击英法侵略者的埃及人民。我们在这个画廊上逗留，犹如在埃及的土地上，呼吸着埃及人所呼吸的空气，与他们同饮着尼罗河的流水。
    7月5日上午，在这个展览会的画廊上还充溢着中埃两国人民的生动的友谊。这里陈列着毛泽东主席论述游击战争的著作和在延安文艺座谈会上讲话的阿拉伯文译本，以及阿拉伯作家所著的“鲁迅回忆”。最吸引人们注意的是，埃及大使夫人西娜波所画的中国画：菊花。
    在这个友谊的画廊上，埃及画家哈森和我国画家吴作人交谈起来，他们在谈论哈森所创作的一幅“我要保卫我的祖国”的铜版画，并且在一起合影留念。另外，在北京大学学习中文的埃及学生欧梦南，也同北京大学阿拉伯文专业的学生在一起亲切地谈论着埃及的一切。欧梦南到中国才半年多，但已经能够勉强地用中国话说一些话了。他热情地对记者说，他有志于从事中国和阿拉伯文学作品的翻译工作。
    拉加卜大使对展览会感到十分满意。他向记者说：“这个展览会组织得好极了。它传达了埃及人民的现代精神，无论帝国主义者怎样阴险，埃及人民将坚决地团结在纳赛尔总统的周围，走向美好的未来！”（附图片）
