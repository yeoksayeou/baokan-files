Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 3rd: Xinhua News Agency and "Southern Daily" reporters report: In Xingning County, Guangdong Province, the hometown of Luo Yiqun, a representative figure of the bourgeois right-wing in Guangdong Province, about 50,000 people held a rally and parade on July 1st, publicly denouncing Luo Yiqun's heinous acts of going to the countryside to incite the masses against the Communist Party.

Luo Yiqun is the Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Councilors' Office. He used the opportunity of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend to issue the fallacy that "Guangdong farmers are close to the verge of starvation." After being repeatedly refuted by all parties, he took advantage of the "inspection" to go to his hometown of Xingning County and Pingyuan, Jiaoling, and other counties to frantically incite students and farmers to oppose the Communist Party. His behavior aroused great indignation among the local people.

The preparatory committee for the Xingning County People from All Walks of Life Counterattacking the Right-Wingers Rally initially estimated that only about 15,000 people would participate in the rally, but many workers, students, especially farmers, came to participate voluntarily, resulting in 50,000 people. The farmers'队伍大约有三万人，他们高举着旗帜，许多人还拿着自己写的标语和画的漫画，喊着口号，敲着震天响的大鼓，从四面八方涌进兴宁城来参加大会。contingent numbered about 30,000, waving flags, many holding self-written slogans and drawn cartoons, shouting slogans, and beating deafening drums, pouring into Xingning City from all directions to participate in the rally.

The大会在下午一时开始。在大会主席团中，有兴宁县各界代表，还有省人民代表大会代表、省政协委员视察组的成员姚雨平等。罗翼群一人孤零零、灰溜溜地坐在主席台前的一角里。罗翼群的家乡燕塘乡的青年农民代表罗用生首先在大会上发言。他说，论辈数，我叫你罗翼群叔父，但看到你这一时期发出的反动言论，我不能这样叫你了。我应该和你划清界限。罗用生在揭露了罗翼群如何布置对党不满的分子帮他收集所谓“饿死人”例子的事实以后说，我们燕塘社三百零三户，每家社员现在每天都能吃到两餐饭一餐粥，怎能说到了“饿死的边缘”？你罗翼群为什么不看看这个全社全村的事实，昧着良心说我们燕塘乡农民到了“饿死的边缘”？rally began at 1 p.m. In the presidium of the rally were representatives from all walks of life in Xingning County, as well as Yao Yiping and others, members of the inspection group of the Provincial People's Congress representatives and the Provincial CPPCC members. Luo Yiqun sat alone and dejectedly in a corner in front of the rostrum. Luo Yongsheng, a young farmer representative from Yantang Township, Luo Yiqun's hometown, was the first to speak at the rally. He said, "According to seniority, I call you Uncle Luo Yiqun, but seeing the reactionary remarks you have made during this period, I can't call you that anymore. I should draw a clear line between you and me." After Luo Yongsheng exposed the fact that Luo Yiqun had arranged for elements dissatisfied with the Party to help him collect so-called examples of "people starving to death," he said, "Our Yantang Cooperative has 303 households, and each member of the cooperative can now eat two meals and one porridge a day. How can it be said that they are on the 'verge of starvation'? Why don't you, Luo Yiqun, look at the facts of the entire cooperative and the entire village, and say with a clear conscience that the farmers in our Yantang Township are on the 'verge of starvation'?"

黄陂乡农民叶锦禄在发言中，指出了罗翼群6月16日在黄陂乡煽动农民反对共产党所引起的恶果。他说，罗翼群这样做，使反革命分子和地主马上活跃起来了，反革命分子造谣说，国民党在汕头登陆了，又说国民党把广州炸烂了。地主作诗来嘲笑贫雇农，他们还说：少数群众也受了罗翼群的欺骗，无理向干部要米要粮，打社主任，为难党委副书记，弄得邪气上升，正气下降。说到这里，他严厉地质问罗翼群：你来兴宁究竟是视察还是破坏？你对党对我们农民究竟安的什么心眼？Ye Jinlu, a farmer from Huangpi Township, pointed out in his speech the evil consequences of Luo Yiqun's incitement of farmers against the Communist Party in Huangpi Township on June 16. He said that Luo Yiqun's actions immediately activated counter-revolutionaries and landlords. Counter-revolutionaries spread rumors that the Kuomintang had landed in Shantou and that the Kuomintang had bombed Guangzhou to ruins. Landlords wrote poems to mock poor and hired peasants. They also said that a small number of people were deceived by Luo Yiqun, unreasonably demanded rice and grain from cadres, beat the cooperative director, and made things difficult for the deputy secretary of the Party committee, causing evil to rise and righteousness to decline. Speaking here, he sternly questioned Luo Yiqun: "Did you come to Xingning for inspection or sabotage? What kind of intentions do you have towards the Party and our farmers?"

兴宁城工人代表陈幼智在讲话中说，罗翼群来兴宁根本不是视察，而是放毒。罗翼群到过哪里，哪里的犯罪分子就胆大起来，敢于进行造谣破坏。陈幼智说，我们坚决跟着共产党走，死也不会跟着你们右派分子走。他向罗翼群说，我今天警告你：你如能回头跟着人民走，我们也许还会原谅你；不然，我们工人决不饶恕你。Chen Youzhi, a worker representative from Xingning City, said in his speech that Luo Yiqun did not come to Xingning for inspection at all, but to spread poison. Wherever Luo Yiqun went, the criminals there became bolder and dared to carry out rumors and sabotage. Chen Youzhi said, "We will resolutely follow the Communist Party, and we will never follow you right-wingers even to death." He said to Luo Yiqun, "I warn you today: If you can turn back and follow the people, we may still forgive you; otherwise, our workers will never forgive you."

龙田中学教师何则文也举出了罗翼群在该校进行挑拨破坏的事实。他希望罗翼群改正错误，不然将自取灭亡。He Zewen, a teacher at Longtian Middle School, also cited the facts of Luo Yiqun's instigation and sabotage at the school. He hoped that Luo Yiqun would correct his mistakes, otherwise he would bring destruction upon himself.

中山大学教授丘琳代表省人民代表大会代表、省政协委员视察小组也在大会上讲话。他说，我们小组同志坚决站在人民这一边，向右派分子进行斗争。丘琳和所有农民、工人、教师代表的讲话，都受到台下几万人的欢呼。Qiu Lin, a professor at Zhongshan University, also spoke at the rally on behalf of the inspection group of the Provincial People's Congress representatives and the Provincial CPPCC members. He said, "Our group comrades resolutely stand on the side of the people and fight against the right-wingers." Qiu Lin's speech and the speeches of all the farmer, worker, and teacher representatives were cheered by tens of thousands of people off the stage.

大会最后通过了“兴宁县各界人民控诉声讨右派分子罗翼群”的电文。电文举出了大量的事实揭露和驳斥了罗翼群的反动言行。电文说：罗翼群到兴宁以后，热情接待地主、富农和被管制的坏分子，布置他们收集所谓“饿死边缘”的证据和书写反对肃反的喊冤信。他到处说“解放后的农民吃不饱，穿不暖”，却不看农民的口粮逐年增多的事实和我们争取农业大丰收的成绩。他说：“现在的学生毕业就等于失业”，他就不看看现在升学的人和就业的人比过去任何一个时期都多的事实。他说“共产党只顾国计，不顾民生”，他就瞎眼看不见灌溉三十多万亩土地的东沟、西沟和合水大水库等水利工程是谁领导我们修起来的，学校和各项文教卫生事业是从什么时候多起来的，他看不见我县二十多个连年重灾乡的农民生活是谁使它安定下来的，是谁使他们赎回过去卖出的子女的。电文最后说，我们感谢共产党拯救我们跳出火坑，我们感谢毛主席引导我们走上社会主义的光明大道，我们热爱自己的人民政府，如果谁敢进行反对共产党、反对人民政府的任何活动，我们就一定挥出铁拳把它捶得粉碎。The rally finally passed a telegram entitled "Xingning County People from All Walks of Life Accusing and Denouncing the Right-Wing Element Luo Yiqun." The telegram cited a large number of facts to expose and refute Luo Yiqun's reactionary words and deeds. The telegram stated: "After Luo Yiqun arrived in Xingning, he warmly received landlords, rich peasants, and controlled bad elements, arranging for them to collect so-called evidence of the 'verge of starvation' and to write letters of grievance against the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He said everywhere that 'farmers after liberation cannot eat enough or dress warmly,' but he does not look at the fact that farmers' rations are increasing year by year and our achievements in striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture. He said, 'Graduating students now are equivalent to being unemployed,' but he does not look at the fact that the number of people entering school and getting employed now is more than in any previous period. He said, 'The Communist Party only cares about the national economy and neglects the people's livelihood,' but he blindly ignores who led us to build the Donggou, Xigou, and Heshui large reservoirs and other water conservancy projects that irrigate more than 300,000 mu of land, when schools and various cultural, educational, and health undertakings increased, who stabilized the lives of farmers in more than 20 severely disaster-stricken townships in our county for years, and who enabled them to redeem their children who had been sold in the past." The telegram finally stated, "We thank the Communist Party for saving us from jumping out of the fire pit, we thank Chairman Mao for guiding us onto the bright road of socialism, we love our People's Government, and if anyone dares to carry out any activities against the Communist Party or against the People's Government, we will definitely smash it to pieces with our iron fists."

    罗翼群是广东省参事室副主任。他利用大鸣大放机会发出所谓“广东农民接近饿死边缘”的谬论，接连受到各方面的驳斥以后，他竟借“视察”名义，到他的家乡兴宁县以及平远、蕉岭等县疯狂地煽动学生、农民反对共产党。他的这种行为引起了当地人民的极大愤慨。
