Without the Communist Party, China Would Perish

Ding Guitang said: I worked in the Customs of old China for 34 years, and continued to work in the Customs after liberation. My own experience tells me: "Without the Communist Party, China would perish."

I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made to this conference by Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li, Bo, and Ulanhu, President Dong, Procurator-General Zhang, and Secretary-General Peng. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our new China has achieved tremendous success every year on all fronts of socialist transformation and socialist construction. The achievements made in the past year have been unprecedented. Even the United Nations acknowledges that our country's industrial growth rate last year was the highest in the world. Can any conscientious Chinese person not wholeheartedly support such a great party and government? However, the right-wing elements, taking advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style, have planned and systematically provoked and incited, issuing fallacies against the Party, the people, and socialism, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. They insisted that shortcomings are the main aspect of the work of the state, and achievements are secondary. They vainly attempt to usurp the leadership of the Party, attempt to restore capitalism, and even spout fallacies such as "Even if the Communist Party perishes, China will not perish; without the Communist Party, others will not sell the country." Premier Zhou has given these fallacies the most severe and correct criticism, and given the right-wing elements a head-on blow, which is very necessary. The people of the whole country who support the Party, love the country, and follow the Communist Party on the socialist road must draw a clear line between themselves and these right-wing elements, and give them a resolute and merciless blow.

I am a Customs worker. I worked in the Customs of old China for 34 years, and continued to work in the Customs after liberation for nearly eight years. Comparing the two stages, the feelings and education given to me are very profound. The right-wing elements say: "Even if the Communist Party perishes, China will not perish." I can say with certainty that without the Communist Party, China would perish. In the past, without the Communist Party, it would have been impossible for the Chinese people to be liberated from the rule of imperialism and feudalism. Today, without the Communist Party, the Chinese people would once again be subjected to the enslavement of imperialism and reactionaries, let alone socialist construction. The history of China in the past century has proven this point. Without the leadership of the working class, the revolutionary struggle can never achieve complete victory. Taking the Customs as an example, which I have personally experienced and have a deep understanding of, without the Communist Party, there would be no people's Customs, and the Customs would forever be in the hands of imperialism.

The Old Customs Was a Tool for Imperialist Aggression Against China

As everyone knows, the Customs guards the economic gate of a country. Therefore, the management right of a country's Customs has a significant impact on whether the country's economy can develop. The management right of the Customs of old China was usurped by imperialism from 1853 until the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in 1949, for nearly a hundred years. The old Chinese Customs was always ruled by the agents of British and American imperialism, the so-called Inspector General of Customs. The main positions in Customs across the country have always been occupied by thousands of foreigners. All the regulations and laws of the old Chinese Customs were formulated according to the unequal treaties and the terms favorable to imperialist aggression. In addition to the unequal treaty terms, the imperialist agents also formulated special measures at any time to facilitate foreign merchants and assist them in their economic aggression against our country. All the laws and decrees of the reactionary government could not be implemented in the old Customs without the consent of the so-called diplomatic corps and the foreign Inspector General of Customs. All Customs tax revenues were withheld as collateral for foreign debt reparations. The reactionary government could not use a single penny without the consent of the Inspector General of Customs. The old Chinese Customs was not bound by the laws and decrees of the reactionary government. It was virtually an independent kingdom in old China. However, the reactionary government did not regard the loss of Customs sovereignty as a disgrace. Imperialism and the rulers of the reactionary government were consistent and closely cooperated in exploiting the Chinese people and opposing the Chinese people's revolution. In order to consolidate their ruling position, the reactionary government did not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty. The unequal treaties and agreements they signed with imperialism fully prove this point. In addition to controlling the financial and economic lifeline of old China, the Inspector General of Customs often directly and indirectly interfered in the political and diplomatic affairs of old China on behalf of imperialism. Therefore, the Chinese Customs after the Opium War has always been a direct tool for imperialism to carry out economic and political aggression against the Chinese people.

The fact that imperialism used the old Customs as a tool for aggression against China is also reflected in the lack of autonomy in Chinese tariffs. The Customs tariff of each country should be formulated according to the needs of domestic production development. All independent and autonomous countries have the right to tariff autonomy, so that they can freely adjust Customs tariff rates at any time to protect domestic production and adapt to the needs of foreign trade. However, the right to tariff autonomy of old China was abolished by imperialism from 1843. For a long period of 106 years before the liberation of the mainland in 1949, the Customs tariff of old China was always restricted and bound by imperialism and could not be independent and autonomous. All tariff rates did not protect domestic production, but facilitated imperialist dumping of goods and acquisition of raw materials. The same import tax was levied on production equipment and consumer goods, and even the import tax rate on some production materials was higher than that on consumer goods. This is a specific manifestation of imperialist colonial policy.

For many years, imperialism relied on the privileges of unequal treaties and various preferential conveniences, and used the very low Customs tariff rates of the old Chinese Customs to import a large number of commodities into our country, mainly consumer goods, and absorb our country's cheap raw materials to carry out economic aggression against our country. In the 73 years before liberation, the import and export trade of old China had a large trade deficit every year until the new China reversed this deficit in 1950. Imperialism also used the so-called mechanism of foreign goods exemption from tax privileges and our country's cheap labor to set up factories in our country to manufacture consumer goods, such as cigarettes, matches, cotton cloth, flour, soap, etc., and dumped them in the market to resist Chinese self-made products, so that China's fragile light industry was strangled to death.

The Customs has the responsibility of cracking down on smuggling, but under the control of imperialism in the old China, not only did it not crack down on smuggling, but it also facilitated smuggling everywhere. Since 1931, although the old Chinese Customs had established anti-smuggling agencies and a large number of land and sea armed forces on the surface, that was imperialism using the name of anti-smuggling to cover up their own smuggling and attempt to control our national defense. At the same time, it was used to deal with the Chinese people, so that imperialism and the bureaucratic capital of old China could not only monopolize foreign trade, but also cover up their smuggling.

Imperialism carried out cruel economic plunder and political oppression through the old Customs for a long time, which not only destroyed the very weak industry of old China, but also defeated the combination of agriculture and handicrafts inherent in our country's social economy, and accelerated our country's fall into a semi-colonial country. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the situation became increasingly worse. American imperialist commodities were smuggled into various places on a larger scale in various covert and open ways. In addition to the dumping of so-called "surplus materials" and "relief materials," the already dying industry and commerce of old China suffered more severe damage. According to incomplete statistics, in August 1948, in Guangzhou, the weaving, rubber, cigarette, match, battery, hardware and other industries were forced to close down by as much as 70% to 80%. As much as 80% of the Shanghai machinery manufacturing industry was forced to close down. Other industries such as leather making, wool weaving, sock making, matches, paper making, food, cigarettes, new medicines, and cement were all heavily hit by the dumping of American goods. The industry and commerce in other parts of the country were also mostly struggling and reduced or stopped production. Workers lost their jobs, the countryside went bankrupt, the national economy was on the verge of collapse, and the fate of the country was at stake. Therefore, the history of the old Chinese Customs is inseparable from the history of the Chinese people being invaded, oppressed, and plundered for a hundred years before liberation.

After Liberation, the Customs Truly Became the Customs of China

In order to recover the management right of the Customs and tariff autonomy, the Chinese people have carried out many struggles, but they have failed to fundamentally achieve their goals. Only the victory of the great People's Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in 1949 drove away imperialism and overthrew the rule of imperialism and the feudal class. The Chinese Customs became the people's Customs and truly grasped the key to China's gate. Without the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people's revolution, it would be fundamentally impossible to obtain the management right of the Customs and tariff autonomy, and it would be even more impossible to save China from destruction.

The Customs is like this, and so is the economy and politics of the entire country. To overthrow the rule of imperialism and reactionaries, and to build socialism, there must be the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party. Without this leadership, it is impossible to win the victory of the revolution, to protect the fruits of the revolutionary victory, and to ensure that imperialism, capitalism, and reactionaries do not re-enslave the Chinese people. Facing these historical iron facts, can the right-wing elements still say that without the Chinese Communist Party, China would not perish? Without the Chinese Communist Party, others would not sell the country?

The rectification movement of the Chinese Communist Party is an extremely great event in the history of our country. The vast majority of the masses not only expressed warm welcome to the Party's wise, great, humble, and sincere measures, but also directly received profound education and encouragement. We firmly believe that through this rectification, the Party will become more pure and stronger, and under the leadership of the Party, China's socialist construction will move forward at a faster pace.

In order to help the Party rectify its work style, many non-Party members have given the Party their opinions without reservation. Although some opinions, including my own, exaggerate shortcomings or criticize inappropriately due to subjective and one-sided views, different personal views, and different feelings, they all start from unity, and the Party welcomes these opinions.

No Leniency Should Be Shown to Right-Wing Elements

Right-wing elements are different. They have always been dissatisfied with the Party, slandering the Party everywhere, attacking the Party everywhere, launching open attacks and concealed attacks, and engaging in cold ridicule and sarcasm, doing everything possible to provoke discord between the Party and the masses. Whether they openly attack the Party or use two-faced tactics to secretly engage in ulterior motives, they all have one thing in common: they want to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and undermine socialist construction. Their conspiracy is to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, oppose the leadership of the Party, and oppose socialism. Their hearts have always yearned for capitalist restoration. Therefore, as soon as the rectification movement began, this kind of people thought they had encountered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and could use the excuse of giving the Party opinions to set fires everywhere, attack the Party and socialism, exaggerate shortcomings, distort facts, publish absurd remarks, organize attack groups, and plan activities in an attempt to overthrow the Party in order to achieve their ambitious goals. The people must not show any leniency to such right-wing elements. The principle of "no crime for those who speak" is not applicable to such people. We must completely smash their conspiracy and thoroughly criticize their absurd remarks. We must resolutely draw a clear line with them, fight against them, and never stop fighting until complete victory is achieved. Right-wing elements, now is the time for you to quickly turn back and make a thorough confession. The gate of socialism is still open to you. If you insist on a reactionary stand and resist a thorough confession to confess to the people, then the people will never be able to forgive you.

专栏：

    没有共产党，中国就会亡
    丁贵堂说：我在旧中国海关工作了三十四年，解放后继续留在海关工作。我亲身经历的例子告诉我：“没有共产党，中国就会亡”。
    我完全同意并衷心热烈地拥护周总理、李、薄、乌三位副总理、董院长、张检察长和彭秘书长向这次大会所作的报告。我们的新中国在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确的领导下，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的各个战线上每年都获得了巨大的成就，在最近一年所获得的成绩更是空前的。就是联合国也承认去年我国工业增长速度是举世第一的。凡是有良心的中国人，对这样伟大的党和政府还能不衷心热烈地拥护吗？而右派分子竟借帮助党整风的机会，有计划、有纲领地挑拨煽动，发出反党、反人民、反社会主义的谬论，向党猖狂进攻，并硬说在国家工作中缺点是主要的，成绩是次要的。他们妄想篡夺党的领导，企图搞资本主义复辟，甚至有“共产党亡了，中国不会亡，没有共产党，人家也不会卖国”等的谬论。周总理已给了这些谬论以最严厉的正确的批判，给了右派分子以当头棒喝，这是非常必要的。我们拥护党，爱护国家，跟着共产党走社会主义道路的全国人民必须与这些右派分子划清界限，并给予他们坚决的毫不留情的痛击。
    我是一个海关工作者，在旧中国海关工作了三十四年，解放后继续留在海关工作，现在将近八年，前后两个阶段对比一下，给予我的感受和教育是非常深刻的。右派分子说：“共产党亡了，中国不会亡”，我十分肯定地说没有共产党，中国就会亡。过去如果没有共产党，中国人民就不可能从帝国主义和封建主义的统治下得到解放，今天如果没有共产党，中国人民就会再一次遭到帝国主义和反动派的奴役，更不必谈什么社会主义建设了。中国近百年来的历史证明了这一点，没有工人阶级的领导，革命斗争总是不能达到彻底的胜利。就拿我亲身经历比较深刻的海关的例子来说，没有共产党也就没有人民的海关，海关就要永远掌握在帝国主义的手里。
    旧海关是帝国主义侵略中国的工具
    大家都知道，海关是把守国家经济大门的，因之一个国家海关的管理权，对那个国家的经济能否发展有着重大的作用。旧中国海关的管理权从一八五三年起就被帝国主义篡夺了，一直到一九四九年中国共产党和毛主席领导的中国人民革命胜利为止，将近一百年的时间，旧中国海关始终由英美帝国主义的代理人，所谓海关总税务司所统治。全国各地海关主要职位，也一向由上千的外国人盘据着。所有旧中国海关的章则法令都是根据不平等条约中有利于帝国主义侵略的条款而制定的。除不平等的条约条款外，帝国主义代理人，又随时为便利洋商任意制定特别办法，以辅助他们对我国的经济侵略。所有反动政府的法律、法令未得所谓外交团和外国人担任的总税务司的同意，不能在旧海关中实行。所有海关的税收都被扣留作为外债赔款的担保，没有总税务司的同意，反动政府不能提用一文。旧中国海关并不受反动政府法律法令的约束，它在旧中国俨然是一个独立王国。但是反动政府并不以丧失海关主权为辱，在剥削中国人民和反对中国人民革命上，帝国主义与反动政府统治者是一致的，而且是密切合作的。反动政府为了巩固他们的统治地位，是不惜出卖国家的主权的。他们与帝国主义历来签订的不平等条约协定完全证明了这点。除掌握旧中国财政经济命脉外，总税务司对于旧中国的政治外交亦常代表帝国主义直接和间接进行干涉。因此，中国海关在鸦片战争后一直是帝国主义对中国人民进行经济和政治侵略的直接工具。
    帝国主义利用旧海关作为侵略中国的工具，还表现在中国关税的不自主上。每个国家的海关税则应该是按照国内生产的发展需要来制定的，凡是独立自主的国家都有关税自主权，以便随时自由地调整海关税率，以保护国内生产而适应对外贸易的需要。但是旧中国的关税自主权从一八四三年起就被帝国主义取消了，在一九四九年全国大陆解放前一百零六年的长时期中，旧中国海关税则始终受帝国主义的限制和束缚，不能独立自主。所有税率不是保护国内生产的，而是便利帝国主义倾销物资、收购原料。生产器材与消费资料征收了同样的进口税，甚至有些生产资料比消费资料的进口税率还高。这就是帝国主义殖民政策的具体表现之一。
    帝国主义多年凭借不平等条约的特权和种种的优惠便利，并利用旧中国海关的很低的关税税率，向我国大量地输入商品，其中主要的是消费品，并吸收我国的廉价的原料，以进行对我国的经济侵略。在解放前七十三年的时间，旧中国的进出口贸易每年都是大量的入超，直到一九五○年新中国才将这个逆差扭转过来。帝国主义又利用所谓机制洋货免税的特权和我国廉价的劳动力又在我国设立工厂制造消费品，如卷烟、火柴、棉布、面粉、肥皂等等，并且在市场上倾销，以抵制中国自制产品，使中国脆弱的轻工业被绞杀殆尽。
    海关本有缉私的责任，而旧中国海关在帝国主义把持下，不但不缉私，而且处处便利走私。从一九三一年起，旧中国海关表面上虽设有查私机构及大批陆海武装力量，但是那是帝国主义借缉私之名以掩护他们自己的私运和企图控制我国国防。同时，并用来对付我国人民，使帝国主义及旧中国的官僚资本既能垄断对外贸易，又能掩护他们的走私。
    帝国主义通过旧海关长期进行残酷的经济掠夺和政治压迫，不但摧毁了旧中国非常薄弱的工业，并且打垮了我国社会经济所固有的农业与手工业的结合，更使我国加速地沦为半殖民地的国家。在抗日战争结束后，情况益趋恶劣。美帝国主义的商品更大规模地用各种隐蔽和公开的方式由各地走私进口。加上所谓“剩余物资”和“救济物资”的倾销，使旧中国的已经奄奄一息的工商业受到更严重的摧残。根据不完全的统计，在一九四八年八月间，广州织布、橡胶、卷烟、火柴、电池、五金等行业，被迫停业的竟达百分之七十到八十，上海机器制造业被迫歇业的竟达百分之八十，其他如制革、毛织、制袜、火柴、造纸、食品、纸烟、新药、水泥等业都因美帝商品的倾销，受到沉重的打击，国内其他地方工商业也大半朝不保夕，纷纷减产或停止生产。工人失业，农村破产，全国经济濒于绝境，国家的命运已岌岌不可终日。因此，旧中国海关的历史与在解放前百年来中国人民被侵略、被压迫、被掠夺的历史是分不开的。
    解放后海关才真正变成了中国的海关
    为了收回海关管理权和关税自主权，中国人民曾经进行过多次斗争，但未能根本达到目的。只有在一九四九年中国共产党和毛主席领导的伟大的人民革命胜利了才赶走了帝国主义，推翻了帝国主义和封建阶级相结合的统治，中国海关才变成了人民的海关，才真正掌握了中国大门的钥匙。没有中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民革命，要想取得海关管理权和关税自主权是根本不可能的，要挽救中国于灭亡，更是不可能的。
    海关是这样，整个国家的经济、政治也都是这样。要推翻帝国主义和反动派的统治，要建设社会主义，就必须有工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党的领导，没有这种领导就不能获得革命的胜利，也不能保护革命胜利的果实，不能保证不让帝国主义、资本主义和反动派重新奴役中国人民。面对这些历史的铁的事实，右派分子还能说没有中国共产党，中国也不会亡吗？没有中国共产党，人家也不会卖国吗？
    中国共产党的整风运动是我国历史上一个极伟大的事件，对党的这种英明、伟大、谦虚和诚恳的措施，广大群众不但表示热烈欢迎，而且直接受到了深刻的教育和鼓舞。我们深信，通过这次整风，党将变得更加纯洁，更加壮健，在党的领导下，中国社会主义建设就将以更快的步伐向前迈进。
    为了帮助党整风，很多非党人士毫无保留地给党提出了意见。虽然有些意见，包括我个人的在内，由于看问题主观片面，个人的观点不同，感觉不同，把缺点夸大或批评得不恰当，但都是从团结出发的，党是欢迎这些意见的。
    对右派分子不应当留情
    右派分子就不然了。他们对党一贯不满，到处说党的坏话，到处攻击党，放明枪、射暗箭，冷嘲热讽，在党群之间极尽挑拨离间的能事。他们不论是明目张胆向党进攻的也好，使用两面手法暗地里干着不可告人的勾当也好，他们都有一个共同点，就是要推翻共产党的领导，破坏社会主义建设，他们的阴谋是反对无产阶级专政，反对党的领导，反对社会主义，他们的内心一直就是向往着资本主义复辟。因此，整风运动一开始，这种人就认为是遇到了千载难逢的好机会，可以借口给党提意见而到处放火，攻击党和社会主义，夸大缺点，歪曲事实，发表荒谬的言论，组织进攻集团，策划活动，企图把党整垮，以便达到他们野心家的目的。对于这种右派分子，人民决不应当稍有留情的，对于这种人“言者无罪”是不适用的。我们必须完全粉碎他们的阴谋，彻底批判掉他们的荒谬言论。我们必须坚决地和他们划清界线，和他们作斗争，不获全胜决不休兵。右派分子们，现在是你们赶快回头，彻底交代的时候了，社会主义的大门对你们还是开着的，如果坚持反动立场，抗拒彻底交代向人民认罪，那么人民必将决不能饶恕你们。
