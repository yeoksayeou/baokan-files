Talking about "Beating to Death with One Blow"
Piāorán

"The firepower in the struggle against the rightists is too fierce, it will commit the error of 'beating to death with one blow'!"—Some people say this.

One must be clear about what is being said. If what is being beaten to death is a person, then we are "treating the illness to save the person." The editorials in the newspapers, the speeches of the National People's Congress representatives, and the criticisms from institutions, schools, workers, and peasants are all aimed at making rightists and those who have committed right-leaning errors "repent sincerely and accept transformation," pulling them back from the brink of death. Here, the question of one blow or multiple blows does not arise.

If what is being beaten to death are the rightists' words and actions, that is, anti-Party, anti-socialist words and actions that attempt to strangle socialism and restore capitalism in a liberated People's China, then what is wrong with "beating to death with one blow"? Why should we "show mercy"? Clearly, the question here is not whether one should beat to death with one blow, but whether one can beat to death with one blow.

We are good at fighting enemies with guns, and we must also be good at fighting enemies without guns or those with only reactionary thoughts. In this struggle against the rightists, some fighters' blows can drag the rightists out from the distant past, from the depths of their thoughts, and from the various specific links of their words, actions, and organizations, exposing their true colors, leaving them nowhere to hide; their crimes are obvious, and everyone shouts to beat them; they have no other choice but to bow their heads, confess their crimes, and accept transformation. Whether these elements have been "beaten alive" with one blow depends on whether they have truly awakened. But the blows are well-aimed, worthy of being called "striking snow on the head above and digging out old roots below."

However, some institutions and schools are not energetic enough in fighting the rightists. They are not good at discovering and analyzing the ugliness of the rightists, and they are not good at grasping sufficient facts and choosing powerful arguments to strike. As a result, some strike inaccurately, some strike weakly, and the rightists not only do not bow their heads, but some even bite back, taking advantage of our incompetence; some temporarily hide, waiting for an opportunity to rise again.

We must not only join the battle, but also practice tactics, we must thoroughly defeat the enemy, and we must temper ourselves in the battle.

The Water Margin relates: Lin Chong and Hong Jiaotou were comparing their skills with sticks in Chai Jin's village. Hong Jiaotou held the stick horizontally, making a posture called "setting fire to the sky"; Lin Chong also held the stick horizontally, making a posture called "parting the grass to find the snake." The core members of the rightists learned Hong Jiaotou's stick technique. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, they divided their forces and sent their generals to set fires everywhere, shouting and cheering, and in some places, a cloud of black smoke appeared. But to try to use a fire to burn the sky led by the Communist Party, which the people loyally support, to burn the sky of socialist construction, is overestimation of their capabilities. Naturally, they can only fall to the ground like Hong Jiaotou. As for the people's blows against the rightists, they use Lin Chong's "parting the grass to find the snake" posture. The snake is a dark thing, it uses grass as a cover, one cannot startle it by beating the grass, one can only part the grass to find it, that is, strip away its disguise, expose its true colors and essence. Once the snake is found, that is, the rightist elements or those with rightist thoughts are found, it is necessary to analyze the size of its body, the severity of its poison, and the impact of its spread, and then determine the content of the beating, the technique of the beating, and the steps of the beating. In short, the strike must be accurate, so that its dodging tricks have nowhere to be used; the strike must be ruthless, so that it does not "revive from the ashes."

As for our shortcomings and errors in our work, whether they are self-examined, examined by non-Party members, or even shouted out by rightists, as long as they should be corrected, they should also be "beaten to death with one blow." Rectification is for this purpose. Do we still cherish the three major styles of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality?

Beating the disease to death with one blow means saving the person with one blow. The commonly said "head-on blow" refers to this.

    谈“一棍子打死”
    飘然
    “斗右派分子火力太猛了，要犯‘一棍子打死’的错误！”——有人这样说。
    话得分清楚。如果说被打死的是人，那我们是“治病救人”，报上的社论、全国人民代表大会代表的发言、机关、学校、工人、农民的批判，都是要右派分子和犯有右倾错误的人“憣然悔悟、接受改造”，把他们从死的边缘救活过来。这里，并不发生一棍子和多棍子的问题。
    如果说，被打死者是右派的言论和行动，即反党反社会主义、企图在解放了的人民中国扼杀社会主义恢复资本主义的言论和行动，那末，“一棍子打死”有何不好？为甚么要“棍下留情”？很显然，这里没有应不应该一棍子打死的问题，只有能不能一棍子打死的问题。
    我们善于和持枪的敌人作战，也要善于和不持枪的敌人或仅有反动思想的人作战。这次反右派分子的斗争，有些斗士的棍子，能够把右派分子从历史的远处、从思想的深处、从言论行动组织等各个具体事实的环节里拖出来，使他们原形毕露，无可躲闪；罪恶昭彰，人人喊打；除低头伏罪、接受改造外，没有其他的路可走。虽然这些分子是否已一棍子被“打活”，要看他们已否真的觉悟。但棍子是使得好的，够得上称“上打雪花盖顶，下打枯树盘根”。
    但也有些机关、学校对右派分子斗得不起劲，他们不善于发现和分析右派分子的丑恶，不善于抓住充分的事实，选择有力的论点去打。因而有的打得不中，有的打得不狠，右派分子不仅不低头，而且有的欺我们无能，反咬一口；有的暂时敛迹，等待时机再起。
    我们不仅要投入战斗，而且练习战术，必须彻底打败敌人，且要在战斗中锻炼自己。
    水浒传载：林冲和洪教头在柴进的庄子里比棍子，洪教头横着棍，使个门户，唤做“把火烧天势”；林冲也横着棍，使个门户，唤做“拨草寻蛇势”。右派的骨干分子学了洪教头的棍，乘着党整风的时候，分兵遣将，到处点火，呐喊助威，在某些地方也出了一股黑烟，但妄想以一把火，来烧人民所忠诚拥护的共产党领导的天，来烧社会主义建设的天，多见其不自量也。自然只能像洪教头一样：扑地倒了。至于人民打右派分子的棍子，是用林冲的“拨草寻蛇”势的，蛇是阴暗的东西，它以草为掩护，不能打草去惊，只能拨草去寻，即剥夺去它的外衣，暴露出它的原形、本质。蛇发现了，即右派分子或有右派思想的分子发现了，要分析它体的大小、毒的轻重、及其传播的影响，然后定出打的内容，打的技术和打的步骤。总而言之，要打得准，使其躲闪的伎俩无所施；要打得狠，不要让它“死灰”还可“复燃”。
    至于我们工作上的缺点和错误，不论是自己检查出来的，是党外人士检查出来的，甚至是右派分子叫嚷出来的，只要是应该改的，也应该“一棍子打死”。整风就是为这个。难道我们对于脱离群众脱离实际的三大主义，还有所爱惜吗？
    一棍子打死了病，即一棍子救活了人。平常说的“当头一棒”就是指此。
