We fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou's report fully illustrates the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, realistically examines the shortcomings in the government's work, and powerfully and sternly criticizes the fallacies of the current right-wing elements. This report is a profound political and ideological education for the people of the whole country, and it also fills us with great excitement and encouragement. Currently, right-wing ambitious elements completely disregard the facts, negate the achievements, and exaggerate the shortcomings. Their intention is to weaken the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and restore capitalism in China. We absolutely cannot tolerate these fallacies. We must adhere to the leadership of the Party and the socialist line, stand firm, distinguish between right and wrong, draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements, and wage a resolute struggle against them.

Now we would like to make the following statement and suggestions based on what we have learned from our recent inspection of higher education, basic construction, and urban planning work in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi'an:

Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi'an are several of the largest cities in the Northwest and Southwest regions, rich in materials, with a concentrated population, and convenient land and water transportation, possessing the conditions for industrial construction. In order to adapt to the requirements of the objective situation, new plans have also been made for urban construction. These situations fully demonstrate the great power of the people and further strengthen our confidence in socialist construction.

Problems Existing in Higher Education

We have focused on inspecting several comprehensive universities and industrial colleges. These institutions have achieved certain results in teaching work by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms, providing many construction cadres for the motherland and accelerating the progress of socialist construction. But on the other hand, the rapid development of higher education has also brought some difficulties to teaching work. With the exception of a very few schools, the lack of teachers (especially older teachers) and the inadequacy of teaching equipment are almost universal phenomena. For example, the Department of Architecture of Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering lacks teachers. In addition to only three professional professors, the rest are young teachers, and most of them only graduated after 1949. Due to the lack of older teachers, young teachers have to take on the work of guiding graduate design, which affects the improvement of teaching quality, and students have many complaints. Another example is Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, which was established last year. The basic equipment is very inadequate, which seriously affects the progress of teaching experiments. We suggest that the relevant departments must pay attention to these problems and try to study solutions.

The readjustment of departments is correct because it creates favorable conditions for large-scale training of construction cadres. If teaching reforms had not been carried out after liberation and advanced Soviet experience had not been learned, it would have been impossible to supply so many technical cadres. But it is undeniable that because the scope of the readjustment of departments was too large and some majors were divided too finely, it has also brought more or less difficulties to teaching and graduate assignment work. Some colleges and universities with a long history and high teaching quality have not been able to maintain their past fine traditions due to the readjustment of departments, which is also a loss. Also, the frequent readjustment of departments in individual institutions of higher learning has affected the normal progress of teaching work. For example, Northwest Institute of Technology was established in 1938 and originally had nine departments including civil engineering, mining and metallurgy, machinery, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, textile, aviation, hydraulic engineering, and industrial management, as a multi-disciplinary institute of technology. After 1952, several readjustments of departments successively transferred out departments or majors such as aviation, telecommunications, mining, industrial and civil construction, and hydraulic construction. The Department of Industrial Management was canceled, and 30 professors, 10 associate professors, 51 lecturers, and 75 teaching assistants, a total of 166 people, were transferred out, and a lot of teaching equipment was also transferred out. The final decision on the current professional settings has not yet been made. When we inspected the institute, all the teachers showed anxiety and raised many complaints, which cannot but affect the current teaching plan and future development prospects of the institute. We believe that in the next few years, higher education institutions in various places should focus on stability. If the objective situation develops in the future and there is a need to readjust departments again, it should also be carried out steadily according to the actual situation. Any rash advances will not have good results. We suggest that the relevant departments must quickly and reasonably resolve the pressing problems currently existing in these institutions.

A Good Example of Diligent and Frugal Factory Construction - Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory

In terms of basic construction, we have inspected several factories, and their construction situations are not the same. Some have been completed well, and they have adhered to the principle of running enterprises diligently and frugally. Some, however, are poorly managed, prolonging the progress and wasting and stockpiling a lot of national construction funds. For example, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory was originally scheduled to start construction in 1958, but construction was started ahead of schedule due to needs. Because the factory leadership was correct, and the factory director, the Party committee, and all staff were able to implement the spirit of running enterprises diligently and frugally and give play to their enthusiasm, they initially considered how to achieve both good and fast results. Therefore, it was decided to reuse the design drawings of the same factory in Harbin, without redesigning them. Construction started in May last year, and most of it has now been completed. At the same time, the factory decided on the principle of "production first, welfare second," so several workshops were completed ahead of schedule. Most of them have now been put into production. In terms of investment, it saved one-third compared to the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory; in terms of time, it shortened it by two and a half years; in terms of labor productivity, it increased by 30%. Moreover, the factory broke the old rules of factory construction and boldly adopted the method of "production first, welfare second, main factory buildings first, and general auxiliary buildings second," carefully calculating and rationally using investment. This year, it reduced investment by 42.3% and can still complete the construction of urgently needed production buildings. On the other hand, this example shows that using reused old drawings can achieve the goals of good, fast, and economical. From our short time of inspection, this factory can be used as a good example of diligent and frugal factory construction. We also inspected the 847 Factory in Xi'an. This factory building was designed by the Soviet Union. The factory building project started in September 1955, using rapid construction methods. Most of them are prefabricated components. All of them were completed in October 1956. Currently, tools have been put into production. We inspected several workshops and saw that most of the machines have been installed, and 80% of all the mechanical equipment is made in China. The workers are satisfied with the results, which shows the progress and rapid development of China's machinery manufacturing industry in the past few years, and we are proud of it. We believe that this factory was completed in just one year and one month from the start of construction. The design, construction, and leadership have made significant achievements. This is a good side.

The Capital Construction Work of Xi'an Electric Factory Put the Cart Before the Horse

On the other hand, the planned scale of the Xi'an Electric Factory is quite large, with the entire factory covering an area of 890,000 square meters. According to the original plan, construction started in 1953 and will not be fully completed until 1960. Currently, some factory buildings are nearing completion and have been partially put into production; some factory buildings are still laying the foundation, and a large part is still waiting for drawings. One factory building started construction in May last year, and the drawings have not been fully completed yet. Some factory buildings and workshops have been built, but the roads and underground pipelines have not been built at all. There is no distinction between priorities, and the cart is put before the horse. Therefore, the overall progress is quite slow, and there is no sign of any tension. This is a bad side. We suggest that the Ministry of Construction should establish an organization to conduct regular comprehensive inspections and supervision to ensure that basic construction work can be completed according to plan and ensure project quality.

Criticizing the Idea of Pursuing Excessive Scale in Urban Construction is Completely Correct

Regarding urban construction, several cities have made many achievements, with Chongqing being more prominent. For example, Chongqing has built many roads since liberation. In the early days of liberation, there were only ten buses. Now there are 199, and trolley buses have been built, and citizens feel that transportation is more convenient. The construction of water supply and drainage systems has also made outstanding achievements. For example, 113.2 kilometers of sewers have been built, and rats and mosquitoes have gradually been eliminated. In this regard, we feel that there has been great improvement in urban transportation and hygiene.

The performance of urban planning work is poor. For example, Chongqing City started urban planning work in 1953. At that time, there were only four staff members. In 1955, it increased to ten people. Now the planning section only has one engineer and several technicians. For such a large and very complex mountain city with a large population, the current urban situation and basic surveys have not yet been completed. Only one or two preliminary planning diagrams have been made, but they are still not in line with reality and have not achieved planning based on local conditions. We believe that there are too few planning staff, the organization is unsound, and the strength is not suitable for the task. At the same time, the administrative leaders have not given due attention to urban planning work.

Regarding the urban planning of Xi'an, we believe that the scale is too large. Xi'an has built a new urban area of 52 square kilometers outside the old urban area of 23 square kilometers. The buildings are scattered in piles here and there, the layout is chaotic and dispersed, and the land waste is very large. According to the city's development scale, the urban population is set at 1.2 million people, and the land use area is calculated at 76 square meters per person, and the city total is 131 square kilometers. The living area per person is calculated at 9 square meters. These quotas are not compatible with the current economic foundation. How was the excessive planned development scale of Xi'an formed, and too much land occupied? It is understood that it was mainly formed under the guidance of doctrinaire and formalistic thinking. In the early stage of construction, the basic indicators of various construction units were set too high, blindly pursuing large scale and magnificent momentum. The planning department designed the overall layout plan for each unit, not from the purpose of seeking truth from facts, but completely to meet the intentions of the construction unit for planning. The construction units then used the highest land use standards in the long-term plan to requisition land, resulting in large areas of fertile land being completely abandoned, hindering farmers' production. In the new urban area's residential building groups, some have formed one street block after another. Some of these blocks are close to factories, and some are far from factories. It is understood that except for the more compact construction in the western suburbs, the others are several kilometers away from the old urban area. In such a scattered situation, all municipal construction investment will increase, such as the roads, sewers, power grids, and other pipelines, as well as public transportation lines throughout the entire area will also need to be lengthened accordingly, resulting in a great waste. Recently, relevant central departments have carried out large-scale inspections, criticized the idea of pursuing excessive scale, and reversed the trend of not seeking reality. We believe that this approach is completely correct.

In general, urban planning is an important and arduous task, and it is necessary to equip it with sufficient technical personnel and cadres so that the strength and tasks are balanced. At the same time, we must adhere to the principles of building the country diligently and frugally, seeking truth from facts, being realistic, adapting to local conditions, adapting to the times, paying attention to short-term planning, and not ignoring long-term planning, so that the work can be done well. This has always been worthy of attention by urban administrative leaders.

Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please criticize and correct them.

### 我们视察的印象和建议  罗明燏、林克明的联合发言

专栏：

    我们视察的印象和建议
    罗明燏、林克明的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理，李先念、薄一波两位副总理，张鼎丞检察长，董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。周总理的报告充分说明了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就，实事求是地检查了政府工作中的缺点，极为有力地和严正地批判了当前右派分子的谬论。这个报告对全国人民是一个深刻的政治思想教育，同时也使我们感到极大的兴奋和鼓舞。目前右派野心分子完全漠视事实，否定成绩，夸大缺点，其用心是想削弱共产党的领导，和反对社会主义，使资本主义在中国复辟。我们对这些谬论是绝对不能容忍的。我们必须坚持党的领导和社会主义路线，站稳立场，分清是非，与右派分子划清界线，向他们作坚决的斗争。
    现在我们想就最近视察重庆、成都、西安的高等教育，基本建设和城市规划工作中所了解的情况作如下的发言和建议：
    重庆、成都、西安是西北、西南地区几个最大的城市，物资富饶，人口集中，水陆交通方便，具备工业建设条件。为了适应客观形势的要求，城市建设也做出了新的规划。这些情况充分显示人民的伟大力量，更加坚定我们对社会主义建设的信心。
    高等教育中存在的问题
    我们曾重点的视察了几个综合大学和工业学院。这些院校由于学习苏联先进经验，进行了教学改革，教学工作取得一定成绩，给祖国提供许多建设干部，加速了社会主义建设事业的进行。但在另一方面，高等学校由于发展过快，也给教学工作带来若干困难。除极少数学校以外，师资缺乏（特别是老教师），教学设备不足，几乎是普遍的现象。如重庆建筑工程学院建筑系师资缺乏，除只有三位专业教授外，其余都是青年教师，而且多数是一九四九年以后才毕业的，由于老教师缺乏，指导毕业生设计工作，不能不由青年教师担任，因而影响教学质量的提高，学生反映意见甚多。又如成都电讯工程学院是去年成立的，基本设备很不充实，严重的影响教学实验的进行。我们建议这些问题有关部门必须予以重视，设法研究解决。
    院系调整为大规模培养建设干部创造有利条件才是正确的，解放后如果不进行教学改革，学习苏联先进经验，不可能供给那么多的技术干部。但无可否认，由于院系调整的幅度太大，有些专业分得太细，也给教学和毕业生分配工作带来或多或少的困难。一些历史较长教学质量较高的院校因院系调整关系，而不能保持他们过去的优良传统，这也是一个损失。又个别高等学校因院系调整次数较多，也影响教学工作的正常进行。如西北工学院在一九三八年成立，原有土木、矿冶、机械、电工、化学、纺织、航空、水工、工业管理等九个系，为一个多科性的工学院。一九五二年以后，几次院系调整，先后调出航空、电讯、采矿、工业与民用建筑、水工建筑等系或专业，工业管理系取消，调出教授三十人，副教授十人，讲师五十一人，助教七十五人，共一百六十六人，教学设备也调出不少。目前专业设置还没有作出最后决定。我们到该院视察时全体教师们表现情绪不安，提出很多不满意见，这不能不影响该院的当前教学规划和将来的发展前途。我们认为在今后几年内各地高等学校应该以安定为主，将来如客观形势发展，有再行院系调整必要时，也应该根据实际情况，稳步地进行，任何急躁冒进，都不会有良好效果的。我们建议有关部门对这些院校目前存在那些迫切需要解决的问题，必须迅速予以合理解决。
    勤俭建厂的好榜样——成都量具刃具厂
    在基本建设方面，我们曾视察过好几个工厂，它们的建设情况都不是一样。有的完成得较好，而且做到勤俭办企业的原则。有些却管理不善，拖长了进度，浪费和积压国家的许多建设资金。如成都量具刃具厂，原定一九五八年开始建厂，后因需要关系提前筹建。由于该厂领导正确，从厂长党委和全体工作人员都能贯彻勤俭办企业的精神，发挥积极性，最初考虑如何能达到又好又快，所以决定以哈尔滨同样工厂的设计图纸重复使用，不另从新设计，从去年五月开始施工，现在已大部分完成。同时厂方决定先生产后福利的原则，所以几个车间提前完成。现在大部分已投入生产。从投资方面来说，比哈尔滨量具刃具厂节省了三分之一；从时间上说，缩短了两年半；从劳动生产率来说，提高了百分之三十。又该厂打破了建厂的老规矩，大胆采用了“先生产后福利，先主要厂房后一般辅助性建筑”的办法，精打细算，合理使用投资，今年削减投资百分之四十二点三，仍然可以完成了急需生产的厂房建设。另一方面，从这个例子可以说明利用重复使用旧图纸，可以达到好、快、省的目的。在我们短短时间视察的体会，该厂可以作为勤俭建厂的好榜样。我们又曾视察西安的八四七厂。这个厂房是苏联设计的，厂房工程从一九五五年九月开始，用快速施工法进行，大部分是预制构件，一九五六年十月已全部完成，目前工具已投入生产。我们视察了几个车间，大部分机器已安装完毕，并看到全部机械设备中有百分之八十是国产机器，使用结果工人认为满意，这可以看到我国几年来机械制造工业的进步和迅速发展，我们是引为自豪的。我们认为这个厂从开工到完成，仅仅一年零一个月，从设计施工和领导方面都有显著成绩，这是好的一方面。
    西安电工厂的基建工作轻重倒置
    另一方面像西安电工厂，计划规模相当庞大，全厂占地八十九万平方公尺，按照原定计划由一九五三年开始建厂，要到一九六○年才能全部完成。目前有些厂房已将近完成，并已部分投入生产；有些厂房正搞基础，而很大部分还等待图纸，有一个厂房从去年五月开工到现在，图纸还没有全部完成，并有些厂房车间已建成而道路和地下管道完全没有建设，先后不分，轻重倒置，因此，总的进度相当缓慢，看不出有任何紧张的现象。这是不好的一面，我们建议中建部应成立一种机构经常进行全面检查和监督，使基建工作能按计划完成和保证工程质量。
    批判城市建设追求规模过大的思想，是完全正确的
    关于城市建设方面，几个城市都有不少成绩，以重庆较为显著，如重庆自解放后修了不少道路；解放初期公共汽车只有十辆，现已有一百九十九辆，另修了无轨电车，市民感到交通比较便利；上下水道的建设也有特出的成绩；如下水道方面共修建了一百一十三点二公里，老鼠、蚊子逐渐消灭。这方面我们感到对城市交通和卫生都有很大的改进。
    关于城市规划工作成绩较差，如重庆市从一九五三年开始进行城市规划工作，当时工作人员仅四人；一九五五年增至十人，现在规划科只有一个工程师几个技术员。以这样庞大和情况非常复杂的山城，人口不少，城市现状和基本调查到现在还没有做出，只做过一两个初步规划示意图，但还是不符合实际，未做到因地制宜的规划。我们认为规划工作人员太少，组织不健全，力量与任务不相适宜，同时行政领导对城市规划工作没有给予应有的重视。
    关于西安的城市规划，我们认为规模偏大。西安市在周围二十三平方公里的旧城区以外，建设了一个面积达五十二平方公里的新市区。建筑物东一堆西一堆，布局凌乱而分散，土地浪费很大。根据该市发展规模，城市人口定为一百二十万人，用地面积每人七十六平方公尺计算，全市合计为一百三十一平方公里，每人住居面积按九平方公尺计算。这些定额在目前的经济基础上是不相适应的。西安市预定发展规模过大，占用土地过多，是怎样形成的呢？据了解主要是在教条主义和形式主义思想指导下形成的。在建设初期各建设单位把基本的指标定得太高，盲目追求规模宏大，气魄雄厚。规划部门替各单位设计总平面图，也不是从实事求是的目的出发，完全为满足建设单位的意图而进行规划。而建设单位又按远景规划采取最高用地标准来征用土地，以致把大片的肥沃土地，完全荒置，妨碍了农民生产。在新市区的住宅建筑群，有些已形成一个一个的街坊。这些街坊有的靠近工厂，有的距离工厂很远。据了解除西郊修建的比较紧凑外，其他都是距离旧市区几公里。这样分散的情况，一切市政建设投资都要增大，如整个区域的道路，上下水道，电力网及其他管线以及公共交通线等也要相应的加长。因此造成很大的浪费。最近中央有关部门已进行大规模检查，批判追求规模过大的思想，扭转了不求实际的趋向，我们认为这样处理是完全正确的。
    总的来讲，城市规划是一个重要而艰巨的工作，必须配备足够的技术人员和干部，使力量与任务取得平衡。同时必须按照勤俭建国，实事求是，切合实际，因地制宜，因时制宜，注意近期规划，也不能忽视远期规划的方针，工作才能做好。这一直值得各城市行政领导人加以重视。
    以上意见，是否有当，请代表们批评指正。
