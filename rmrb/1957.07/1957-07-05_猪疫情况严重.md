　　Swine Fever Situation Serious
　　(Our Dispatch) Our reporter Li Gendi reports: In the first half of this year, the number of swine deaths due to swine fever nationwide has increased compared to last year. According to incomplete statistics from eleven provinces and cities, 1.18 million pigs have died. In areas with severe swine fever, such as Henan Province, the number of pig deaths from January to May already accounts for 5% of the total number of live pigs; in Hebei Province, 300,000 pigs died last year, and as of early June this year, according to statistics from eighty counties, the number of pig deaths has reached 268,000.
　　The reasons for the pig deaths are relatively complex. The main ones are as follows: First, the pig-raising industry has developed rapidly this year, and the transfer of piglets is frequent, but quarantine and hygiene work is poor, leading to piglet deaths. For example, Guangxi transferred 6,000 pigs from Hunan this year, and 80% of them died en route. Second, preventive measures have not kept up with the rapid development of pig production. In many places, insufficient attention was paid to spring epidemic prevention work at the beginning, and rural epidemic prevention organizations are incomplete and understaffed. Some areas underestimated the potential epidemics this year, and preventive activities lagged behind the epidemic. Third, the excessive reduction of epidemic prevention funds in many places has also affected epidemic prevention work. According to statistics from the four serum factories in Nanjing, Lanzhou, Henan, and Jiangxi, the pre-purchase volume of swine erysipelas and swine fever vaccines this year has decreased by 59% to 71% compared to last year due to lack of funds in various provinces.
　　Currently, the overall trend is that swine fever is declining. With the assistance of relevant central departments, epidemic prevention funds have been largely resolved; vaccine inoculation work is gradually being carried out; quarantine and hygiene work during transportation has also attracted attention; and many areas are vigorously fighting swine fever. However, to completely solve the problem of swine fever nationwide, the relevant departments still need to pay attention and make efforts.

    猪疫情况严重
    本报讯　记者李根蒂报道：今年上半年，全国疫猪死亡较去年有发展。据十一个省、市不完全统计，死猪一百一十八万头。猪疫严重的地区，如河南省，1月到5月死猪量已占生猪头数的5％；河北省去年死猪三十万头，今年截至6月上旬，据八十个县的统计，死猪已达二十六万八千头。
    死猪的原因比较复杂。主要的有以下几个：第一，今年养猪事业发展快，仔猪调运频繁，但检疫卫生工作较差，引起仔猪死亡。如广西今年从湖南调运六千头猪，途中就死亡了80％。其次，在生猪大发展中，防疫措施没有跟上。不少地方对春季防疫工作开始重视不足，农村防疫机构不健全，人员少。有的地区对今年可能发生的疫情估计不足，防疫活动落到疫情后边。第三，不少地方的防疫费用削减过大，也影响了防疫工作。据南京、兰州、河南、江西四个血清厂的统计，各省因无钱购买，今年猪丹毒、猪肺疫疫苗的预购量比去年减少了59％到71％。
    目前，就总的趋势看，猪疫已在下降。经中央有关部门协助，防疫经费大体上已经解决；疫苗预防注射工作，正在逐步开展；贩运中的检疫卫生工作，也已引起注意；不少地区正在大力扑灭猪疫。但是，要在全国范围彻底解决猪疫问题，还需有关部门重视和努力。
