    *Sanghuang* (桑蟥)

    *Sanghuang* belongs to the order Lepidoptera, family Bombycidae, and is a common mulberry tree pest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong and other provinces in China. This pest is particularly rampant in the mulberry areas along the Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, often causing disastrous damage. *Sanghuang* breeds one to three generations a year, and the larvae feed on mulberry leaves. The affected mulberry leaves are covered with boreholes, resulting in a sharp decline in production and a drop in quality.

    名辞解释
    桑蟥
    桑蟥属鳞翅目，家蚕蛾科，是我国江苏、浙江、安徽、湖北、广东等省常见的桑树害虫。这种害虫在江苏、浙江的太湖沿岸桑区尤其猖獗，常常为害成灾。桑蟥每年繁殖一到三代不等，幼虫以桑叶为食料。被害的桑叶满布蛀孔，因此产量大减，质量下降。
