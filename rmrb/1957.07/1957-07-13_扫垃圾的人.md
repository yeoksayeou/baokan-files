The Garbage Collector
Zhang Wei

I. Marriage

When Feng Mingqing recalled his marriage prospects, he still remembered the unpleasant stories. They happened shortly after he became a street cleaner.

One day in 1953, Feng Mingqing quickly finished sweeping the garbage on the street, tidied himself up, and went to meet his prospective partner. After they met, they chatted happily about their ages and family situations. Suddenly, the girl asked him, "Where do you work?" He said, "Wuchang Cleaning Team." "What does the Cleaning Team do?" He gestured with his hand: "It's the people who sweep up the garbage on the streets!" The girl's face turned red instantly, and she lowered her head without saying another word. Feng Mingqing was stunned for a moment and understood what was happening. Without saying a word, he went out and left. He felt very upset along the way.

His mother asked someone to introduce Feng Mingqing to another potential partner. He went to see her. Like the previous girl, she was also a girl who had attended junior high school. Xiao Feng carefully talked to her. Finally, she asked him: "Where do you work?" This time, he did not describe his job so specifically but said vaguely: "In the Sanitation Department." The girl smiled softly. The matter was settled. Two weeks later, the girl suddenly heard from a neighbor: "Feng Mingqing is a garbage collector!" She was dubious and inquired about the area where Feng Mingqing swept garbage, determined to see for herself. That day, she took a public bus to the Shuili Street area of Wuchang. Sure enough, she saw Feng Mingqing wearing old and dirty clothes, busy sweeping the garbage on the street with others. This girl, who valued her appearance, didn't look at the garbage collector again and walked away. She did not keep her appointment with Feng Mingqing that Sunday. She ignored him from then on.

Feng Mingqing felt indescribably troubled. He said roughly to his mother: "Don't you ever mind my marriage affairs again!" However, his mother was very anxious because his marriage prospects had failed once or twice. She asked someone to introduce him to another girl. This time, as soon as he entered the door, he said to the girl: "I am a garbage collector. If you don't mind, we can talk; if you do, let's just forget about it."

Like the previous girls, this girl also looked down on him for being a garbage collector.

II. Leaving the Team

From then on, he often grumbled, made strange remarks, cursed his job for being unpromising and too shameful. When he went to work every day, he was afraid of being seen by acquaintances, so he wore a mask that almost covered his eyes. When he was pulling the garbage cart on the street, he would get angry and argue loudly with anyone who called him "garbage puller." Sometimes, he was too lazy to pull the cart, so he would coax a child to pull it for him, while he just rang the bell on the side. The nearby residents shook their heads when they mentioned him, saying: "That young man named Feng in the cleaning team is the most mischievous."

He was determined not to be a cleaner anymore. He submitted three resignation applications in a row. The organization and comrades all advised him not to resign.

In the first half of 1955, he finally left the cleaning team privately.

He drove a horse-drawn carriage outside for three days. Team leader Tao from the team came to Feng Mingqing's home to persuade him to return to the team: "Driving a horse-drawn carriage is not a permanent job. There is nothing shameful about being a cleaner. As long as you do a good job and have a good service attitude, the masses will love you, and that is the future." Feng Mingqing couldn't listen to him and argued with Team Leader Tao in a huff. Team Leader Tao became a little anxious and said seriously: "In any case, the cleaning team is still an organization. If you have difficulties, the organization will help you solve them. Have you forgotten about your illness that time? Without the organization, would you still be here, Feng Mingqing?..." Hearing this, Feng Mingqing suddenly fell silent.

Team Leader Tao's words brought his thoughts back to the beginning of 1952. It was just before the Spring Festival, and he had a high fever, talking nonsense; it was difficult to find a doctor, and there was no money for treatment. His father and mother were restless with anxiety. After finally enduring until the third day of the new year, his illness showed no signs of improvement. His father had no choice but to go to the cleaning team to ask the team for help. The team immediately informed the sanitation section of the situation, and the sanitation section immediately sent someone to take Feng Mingqing to the best Xiehe Hospital in Hankou for treatment. He stayed in the hospital for more than a month. The public paid for more than 170 yuan in medical expenses, and he only paid 18 yuan for food. After he was discharged from the hospital, the team also allowed him to rest for more than a month, with his salary still paid. ... Thinking of this, his throat seemed choked, and he couldn't speak for a moment. At this time, his father was also persuading him: "All jobs are the same kind of labor, you should go back to the team!"

Feng Mingqing returned to the cleaning team again.

III. Elected as a Model Worker

After returning to the team, the organization continued to educate Feng Mingqing and taught him how to improve his work. The comrades also often encouraged him.

The labor competition began.

"How can I do a good job? How can I improve work efficiency?" Feng Mingqing pondered this question day and night. There were four people in their group. The quota was an average of six carts of garbage swept and transported per person per day. In reality, they could complete the task ahead of schedule, and they still had plenty of time. He suggested to the team leader to reduce one person. This suggestion was supported by the leadership, and each group reduced one person. After their group reduced one person, sometimes one person could sweep and transport ten carts of garbage a day, and residents reflected that their cleaning work was done well.

Last year, it was during the hot summer. One day, when Feng Mingqing passed by an open space on Zhongying Street, he saw a garbage heap that was four or five feet high. It was dirty and smelly, with swarms of flies. He wanted to clear this pile of garbage. However, if he relied on himself alone to clear it in his spare time, it would take at least a month. He went to the residents' committee for help. The health committee member of the residents' committee agreed to mobilize the youth shock team among the residents to work with him. They used the time before Feng Mingqing went to work on two mornings and hauled away four or five carts of garbage, and then they cleaned up the pile of garbage.

The nearby residents praised the young man from the cleaning team for doing a good thing for them. After they found out the young man's name, they beat gongs and drums and went to the cleaning team to send a commendation. Feng Mingqing was pushed out, and he explained shyly that he had not done anything remarkable.

On this day, Feng Mingqing's mood could not calm down no matter what.

"I unintentionally did this little thing, and the masses respect me so much! Really, being a cleaner is not lowly! From now on, I will do a better job of cleaning!"

He happily pulled the garbage cart out every day. When he saw old women, children, and pregnant women coming out to take out the garbage, he hurried up to take it from them; in winter, when the cold wind was howling, and the ground was covered with ice and snow, he knew that people didn't want to come out to take out the garbage, so he walked to the residents' doorsteps and took the garbage basket by basket and brought it back, and then sent the basket back.

Once, an old woman's house was being renovated, and there was a pile of broken bricks and messy grass left over, which she had no way to transport away, so she found Feng Mingqing, who was sweeping and transporting garbage, and said: "Comrade, can you help me get rid of it?" At that time, the cleaning team had three "no's": they didn't haul construction waste; they didn't haul garbage swept up on residents' sanitation day; and they didn't haul rice straw. He didn't dare to agree at the time. After returning to the team, he discussed it with his group. They said: "Don't delay the main work for it, and we don't have extra time, so let's not go." Feng Mingqing thought to himself: "The old woman is so old, how can she get rid of this pile of garbage? I might as well use the one-hour break at noon to do it myself."

At noon, he pulled the cart, braving the scorching sun, and cleaned up the pile of broken bricks and messy grass. The old woman was so grateful that she didn't know what to do, and she was busy pouring him tea and asking him all sorts of questions. Feng Mingqing suddenly had a feeling of happiness, and the fatigue and heat were forgotten.

Now, the nearby residents all love him very much, and everyone affectionately calls him Little Feng. The old women often call him into their houses to eat candy and drink tea.

This year, Feng Mingqing was elected as a model worker and attended the Wuhan City Labor Model Conference. His name and his deeds have been widely publicized by the newspapers and praised by the masses. Many people said: "In the new society, no matter what kind of work you do, it is honorable!"

As for Feng Mingqing's marriage, everyone must be very concerned, right? Now, he has married a girl from a working people's family, and they already have a lovely fat baby.

    扫垃圾的人
    张碨
    一、亲事
    冯明清提起自己的亲事，直到现在，他还记得那一些不顺心的故事。那是从他当上街道清洁工以后不久接连发生的。
    1953年的一天，冯明清迅速拖完了街道上的垃圾，混身收拾得干干净净，去看对象了。见面以后，两人愉快地交谈着年龄和家庭情况。忽然，姑娘问他：“你在哪里工作呀？”他说：“武昌清洁队。”“清洁队是干什么的？”他用手一比划：“就是街上扫渣子（垃圾）的！”姑娘的脸刷地红了，她低下头再没吭声。冯明清楞了一下，心里明白了是怎么回事。他二话没说，就出门走了。一路上，他心里很不是味儿。
    母亲托人给冯明清又说了一门亲事。他又去看对象了。和前一个姑娘一样，这也是个读过高小的姑娘。小冯小心地同她谈着。终于她问他了：“你在哪里工作呀？”这次，他没有把工作说得那么具体，只含糊地说：“在卫生科。”姑娘轻声笑了笑。事情谈妥了。两个星期之后，姑娘忽然听街坊说：“冯明清是个扫渣子的！”她半信半疑地向人家打听了冯明清扫垃圾的地区，决心自己去看一看。这天，她搭上公共汽车，到了武昌水陆街一带，果然，她看见冯明清穿了一身又旧又脏的衣服，正同别人一起忙着打扫街道上的垃圾。这个爱面子的姑娘没有再多看这扫垃圾的人一眼，就走开了。这个星期天，她没有赴冯明清的约会。她再也不理他了。
    冯明清的心里说不出的烦恼。他粗声粗气地对母亲说：“以后，你们再不要管我的亲事了！”可是，母亲看他的亲事一次两次说不成，很是心焦。她又托人给他说了一门亲事。这次，他一进门，就对姑娘说：“我是个扫渣子的，你不嫌弃，咱就谈下去；不行，干脆就算了。”
    这个姑娘和以前的姑娘一样，也看不起他这个扫垃圾的人。
    二、离队
    从此以后，他常常发牢骚、说怪话，咒骂自己的工作没出息，太丢人。每天出工的时候，他怕熟人看到，把口罩戴得差点连眼睛都遮住了。在街道上拖垃圾车的时候，听见谁叫他“拖渣子的”，他就恼火，大声地和人家吵。有时候，他懒得拖车子，就哄个小孩子替他拖，自己只在一边摇铃。附近的居民提起他就摇头，说：“清洁队那个姓冯的年轻人最挑皮。”
    他下决心不干清洁工了。他接连呈送了三次退职申请书。组织上和同志们都劝他不要退职。
    1955年上半年，他终于私自离开了清洁队。
    他在外边赶了三天马车。队里的陶队长到冯明清家里来劝他回队去：“赶马车总不是固定的工作。当清洁工没有什么不光彩，只要你作好工作，服务态度好，群众就会喜爱你，这就是前途。”冯明清听不下去，他气鼓鼓地和陶队长顶嘴。陶队长有点急了，严肃地说：“不管怎样，清洁队还是个组织。你有困难组织上会帮助你解决，难道你忘记了你那次生病的事情了？不是组织上，现在那还有你冯明清这个人？……”听到这里，冯明清突然不作声了。
    陶队长的话把他的思想引回到1952年初去。那时候正是春节前夕，他发高烧，烧得直说胡话；找医生不好找，治病也没有钱。他父亲、母亲急的坐卧不安。好容易挨到年初三，他的病一点也不见轻。父亲只得到清洁队去，请求队里想办法。队里立即把情况告诉了卫生科，卫生科马上派人把冯明清送到汉口最好的协和医院去治病。他在医院住了一个多月。住院的一百七十多元医药费由公家代出，自己只出了十八元的伙食费。出院以后，队里还让他休息了一个多月，工资照发。……想到这里，他的喉头像哽住了一样，一时说不出话来。这时，父亲也在旁边劝他：“什么工作都是一样劳动，还是回队去吧！”
   冯明清又回到清洁队里来了。
    三、当选劳动模范
    回队以后，组织上继续对冯明清进行教育，并且教他怎样改进工作。同志们也常常鼓励他。
    劳动竞赛开始了。
    “怎样才能搞好工作呢？怎样才能提高工作效率呢？”冯明清日夜思考着这个问题。他们小组一共有四个人，定额是平均每人每天打扫并拖运六车垃圾，实际上他们能提前完成任务，时间还很宽裕。他就向组长建议减少一个人。这个意见得到领导上支持，每个组都减少了一个人。他们组里减少一个人以后，有时候一人一天能打扫和拖运十车垃圾，居民反映他们的清洁工作做得不错。
    去年，正是炎热的夏天。有一天，冯明清路过中营街一块空地的时候，看见了一个有四五尺高的垃圾堆。又脏又臭，苍蝇成堆。他想清除这堆垃圾。可是，光靠他一个人在工余的时间来清除它，起码得一个月。他去找居民委员会帮忙。居民委员会的卫生委员答应发动居民中的青年突击队来同他一起干。他们利用了冯明清两个早上出工以前的时间，拖走了四、五车渣滓，便把这堆垃圾清扫干净了。
  附近的居民都称赞清洁队那个年轻人为他们作了好事。他们打听出这个年轻人的名姓以后，就敲打着锣鼓到清洁队送表扬喜报。冯明清被人拥出来，他不好意思地向人解释着自己并没有作什么了不起的事情。
    这一天，冯明清的心绪怎样也平静不下来。
    “我无意间作了这一点小事，群众就这样尊敬我！真的，清洁工并不下贱呀！今后，我要把清洁工作做得更好啊！”
    他每天愉快地拖着垃圾车出去。看见老婆婆、小孩和孕妇出来倒垃圾，他赶忙上去接过来；冬天，外面寒风呼啸，冰天雪地，他知道人们不好出来倒垃圾，便走到居民们的屋门口，把一簸箕一簸箕的垃圾接过来倒了，又把簸箕送回去。
    一次，有个老婆婆家里修了房子，剩下一堆碎砖乱草，没有办法运走，便找到正在扫运垃圾的冯明清说：“同志，你能不能帮忙把它弄走？”那时候，清洁队有三不拉：修房子的垃圾不拉；居民卫生日打扫的垃圾不拉；稻草不拉。他当时没敢答应。回队以后，他和同组的人商量。他们说：“不要为它耽误了正事，又没有多余的时间，还是不去吧。”冯明清心里想：“老婆婆那么大年纪，怎么弄走这堆垃圾呢？干脆利用中午一个来钟头的休息时间，自己去干了它算了。”
    中午，他拉着车子，冒着酷热的阳光，把这堆碎砖乱草打扫干净了。老婆婆感激得不知怎么好，又是忙着给他倒茶，又是拉着他问长问短。冯明清突然有一阵幸福的感觉，累和热被遗忘了。
    现在，附近居民都很喜爱他，大家亲切地喊他小冯。老婆婆们还常把他叫到屋子里吃糖，喝茶。
    今年，冯明清被选为劳动模范，出席了武汉市的劳动模范大会。他的名字和他的事迹，通过报纸的宣传，被广大群众传颂着。不少人说：“在新社会里，不论做什么工作，都是光荣的啊！”
    至于冯明清的亲事，大家一定很关心吧？现在，他已经同一个劳动人民家庭出身的姑娘结了婚，而且已经生了一个可爱的胖娃娃。
