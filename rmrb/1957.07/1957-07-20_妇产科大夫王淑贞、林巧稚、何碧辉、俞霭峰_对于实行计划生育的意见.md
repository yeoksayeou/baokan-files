    Opinions on Implementing Family Planning
    We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and other reports of the conference. Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the government, the living standards of the Chinese people have improved, and medical and health work has been improved, and the mortality rate of newborns has been reduced unprecedentedly. This fact powerfully refutes the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies put forward by right-wing elements that people's living standards have been reduced and health services have not developed.
    Children are our second generation and successors to the socialist cause, and we love them. However, if there are too many or too closely spaced births, from an individual point of view, it will affect the health of mothers and children, hinder the mother's production or work, and increase the difficulty for parents to raise and educate their children; from the perspective of the country, too rapid population growth will increase consumption, affect the accumulation of construction funds, and hinder further improvement of people's living standards. Therefore, family planning is an important task related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and it is necessary to attract the attention of leaders at all levels and all the people. We obstetricians and gynecologists would like to put forward the following suggestions on family planning.
    Contraception is an Important Measure
    Is there a way to implement family planning? There is a way. Contraception is an important and specific measure to achieve family planning. Contraception will not only not affect the health of couples or mothers and children, but it is also beneficial to the health of mothers and children. Proper spacing of births and the mother's good health are important conditions for the normal development and growth of the fetus and infant. At the same time, contraception is also reliable; if done well, it is more than 90% effective. Therefore, we should have confidence in promoting contraception.
    In the past two years, although we have also done some work on contraception, the effect is not satisfactory. What is the reason for this? According to our analysis, there are the following aspects:
    1. First of all, it should be pointed out that there are shortcomings in the contraception propaganda work: In the past few years, our propaganda on contraception has not been universal enough or in-depth enough. In addition, there are still certain shortcomings in the propaganda methods. This is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the significance of contraception propaganda work. Taking medical staff as an example, the promotion of this work in the past was not enthusiastic or active enough, and some people even believed that contraception was not a scientific and technical issue, so there was no need for senior medical staff to do it. Young medical staff, due to lack of guidance and education, also do not pay enough attention to this work. Other relevant parties have never regarded contraception as a key issue for propaganda.
    We believe that, according to the current needs, the content of propaganda should mainly include ideological mobilization and method introduction.
    Conduct Universal and In-depth Ideological Mobilization
    1. Ideological mobilization is still an important step in promoting contraception at this stage. This is mainly because many people still have incorrect views on contraception in their minds. Some people, although they have the need for contraception, are embarrassed to propose it under the influence of feudal and conservative ideas. Some people, due to lack of hygiene knowledge, mistakenly believe that contraception is not in line with the laws of nature, thus generating various concerns and lacking sincerity and confidence in contraception; they cannot master the methods of contraception well; even if they master it, they cannot persist and give up halfway; they do not use it once or twice and become pregnant again, so they complain about the unreliability of contraception methods and lose confidence in it.
    Some male comrades mistakenly believe that raising children is a matter for women, and the state bears the burden of children's illness and education, which has little to do with themselves. Therefore, they cannot correctly understand the adverse effects of excessive or closely spaced births on the health of mothers and children and on socialist construction, and they are not active or proactive enough about contraception, indifferent or even resistant. They only see the inconvenience and lack of freedom of contraception, but they cannot see the positive significance of contraception in family planning and in accelerating socialist construction.
    The above ideological situations are what we have learned in our medical work. These ideological situations are undoubtedly a major obstacle to the promotion of contraception and must be corrected through vigorous, universal, and in-depth propaganda. In addition to our medical staff making further efforts in propaganda work, we also hope that trade unions, women's federations, youth federations, and other relevant parties will give strong support and assistance, and carry out ideological mobilization through various effective propaganda methods, creating an atmosphere of contraception among the masses, especially among married men and women, so that everyone can ideologically realize the great significance of contraception to personal and national interests.
    Introduce Contraception Methods Comprehensively and Systematically
    2. Introduction of contraception methods. This work is the responsibility of all medical staff. In the past, it was not comprehensive or systematic enough. At the same time, there are still shortcomings in the propaganda materials, such as not being popular enough and not being practical enough. In order to vigorously promote contraception, every obstetrician, gynecologist, and urologist must first master the relevant theoretical knowledge and technical operations of contraception. Medical and health institutions at all levels, including hospitals, clinics, factory health stations, and rural medical stations, must set up contraception technology guidance clinics so that contraception propaganda and technical guidance can be carried out in institutions at all levels.
    Because contraception methods have not yet been sufficiently trusted by the people, we must be particularly cautious when introducing methods. Only some practical, reliable, and harmless contraception methods should be introduced. Some methods whose effects have not yet been determined or have been scientifically proven to be harmful should not be introduced rashly.
    In the past few months of promoting contraception, we have found an abnormal phenomenon. Some department store windows and streets have displayed some models and diagrams related to contraception, and explanations of contraception methods have also appeared on the screens of children's cinemas. We believe that this kind of propaganda that does not distinguish between old and young, occasions, or forms is inappropriate, because it may have a bad influence on children's minds; the target of propaganda is best limited to married men and women.
    2. There are shortcomings in the supply of contraceptive drugs and equipment, such as poor quality, insufficient quantity, and not many varieties. Although the supply situation has improved recently, there are still many problems in quality. At present, there is no contraceptive product appraisal agency in my country. We believe that it is necessary to train relevant technical personnel and establish appraisal agencies to ensure the quality of contraceptive products and improve the supply. Only in this way can the effect of contraception work be materially guaranteed.
    Strengthen Scientific Research on Contraception
    3. In the past, scientific research on contraception was very inadequate. Although the existing contraception methods are effective, they are not simple enough. These problems urgently need to be studied vigorously in order to gradually find solutions. Recently, the Science Committee has included contraception research in the medical science research plan, which shows the high attention paid by the Party and the government to contraception and the unparalleled concern for the people's health. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this work, we also hope that all relevant parties will give strong assistance in terms of manpower and material resources; not only obstetricians, gynecologists, and urologists, but also all medical staff and scientific workers in related departments such as medicine, physiology, and chemistry are expected to participate in this important research. In the scientific research on contraception, our past experience is insufficient and the foundation is also very poor. In the future, the direction of research should mainly be: conducting appropriate research on new methods that other countries consider effective in order to quickly gain experience. At the same time, we should also actively research the medicines and ancient prescriptions that traditional Chinese medicine considers effective, and scientifically verify their effects in order to better promote them.
    Here, we would also like to mention a few other issues related to family planning:
    Induced Abortion is Not a Contraception Method
    1. Induced abortion: First of all, it should be affirmed that induced abortion is not a contraception method. On the contrary, it will hinder the promotion of contraception. According to actual investigations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places, since the announcement of the relaxation of the limits of induced abortion, the number of people in contraception clinics has decreased significantly. In addition, some people have even abandoned their original contraception methods, thinking that they can use induced abortion to solve the problem after pregnancy. This is a very bad phenomenon. After all, induced abortion is a surgery. During the surgery, there may be dangers such as uterine perforation, massive bleeding, and infection and inflammation; because it is a surgery that violates natural development, symptoms caused by neurological and endocrine dysfunction may remain after the surgery. We often see women who have had induced abortions in the past have chronic symptoms such as excessive vaginal discharge, back pain, and backache in our diagnosis and treatment work. These adverse effects of induced abortion are well known to medical scientists at home and abroad, and are the main reasons why medical staff are unwilling to easily perform induced abortions. Recent investigations and research on this issue in various places have also confirmed this point. Although we are very unwilling to see these complications and are making our best efforts to prevent them, we have not yet found a way to eliminate these complications, especially sequelae. We really want to advise patients not to have induced abortions, but we are unwilling to tell patients the above-mentioned risks and sequelae without reservation, because we know that doing so will only increase their mental burden, which is not in line with the principle of protective medical care.
    Permanent Contraception Methods Cannot be Adopted Casually
    2. Permanent contraception: Tubal ligation or vasectomy can be appropriately chosen for couples with too many children or women with poor health, but these surgeries are permanent contraception methods, so they cannot be adopted casually regardless of the situation.
    Young People Should Not Get Married Too Early
    3. Marriage age: My country has a habit of early marriage. After liberation, due to the improvement of living standards, the situation of early marriage has increased among many young students, workers, and farmers. These young people often have continuous births after marriage, which seriously affects their studies, work, life, and health, and they cannot fulfill their responsibility to educate their children. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to establish a trend among young people not to get married too early.
    Regarding the promotion of family planning, although the Central Ministry of Health made arrangements in the past, the results were not ideal due to the lack of necessary supervision and inspection. In the future, we hope that the Party and the government will strengthen their leadership over this work. We also hope that all representatives will give strong assistance in propaganda and promotion so that family planning can be realized as soon as possible, accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, and enable the people's lives to continue to improve.
    Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please correct them.

### 妇产科大夫王淑贞、林巧稚、何碧辉、俞霭峰  对于实行计划生育的意见

专栏：

    妇产科大夫王淑贞、林巧稚、何碧辉、俞霭峰
    对于实行计划生育的意见
    我们完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。解放以来，在共产党和政府的正确领导下，我国人民生活得到提高，医药卫生工作有了改进，新生儿死亡率空前的降低。这一个事实，有力的驳斥了右派分子所提出的人民生活降低、卫生事业没有发展的反党、反社会主义的谬论。
    儿童是我们的第二代，是社会主义事业的接班人，我们爱他们。但是，如果生育得过多过密，从个人方面说，会影响母子的健康，妨碍母亲的生产或工作，增加父、母抚养和培育子女的困难；从国家方面说，人口增加过快就要增加消费，影响建设资金的积累，妨碍人民生活进一步的提高。因此，计划生育是一项有关国计民生的重要工作，有引起各级领导部门和全体人民重视的必要。我们几位妇产科大夫愿就计划生育问题提出下面的意见。
    避孕是一项重要措施
    计划生育有没有办法呢？是有办法的。避孕就是实现计划生育的一项重要而具体的措施。避孕不仅不会影响夫妇或母子的健康，而且是有益于母子健康的。生育的间隔适当，母亲的身体健康，是使胎婴儿正常发育成长的重要条件。同时，避孕也是可靠的；如果做得好，百分之九十以上是有效的。因此我们对推行避孕工作应抱有信心。
    二年来，我们在避孕问题上，虽然也作了一些工作，但是效果是不够令人满意的。这是什么原因呢？根据我们的分析，有以下的几方面：
    一、首先应该指出的是避孕宣传工作中的缺点：几年来，我们对避孕问题的宣传是不够普遍、不够深入的。此外，在宣传方法上也还存在着一定的缺点。这主要是由于人们对避孕宣传工作的意义认识不足。就拿医务人员来讲，对此项工作的宣传，过去也是不够热情、不够积极的，甚至还有人认为避孕并不是科学技术性的问题，因此，不需要高级医务人员来作。年青的医务人员由于缺乏指导和教育，对这工作也是不够重视的。其他有关方面也从没有将避孕问题当作重点来进行宣传。
    我们认为，根据目前的需要，宣传内容主要应该包括思想动员及方法介绍二个方面。
    普遍、深入地进行思想动员
    1．思想动员，在现阶段，仍然是推行避孕工作中的一个重要步骤。这主要是因为许多人在思想中还存在着对避孕不正确的看法。有些人虽然有避孕的要求，但是在封建保守思想的影响下，不好意思提出。有些人，由于缺乏卫生常识，错误地认为避孕是不合乎自然规律的，因而产生了种种顾虑，并对避孕缺乏诚意和信心；不能很好的掌握避孕的方法；即使掌握了也不能坚持，半途而废；一、二次不用，又怀上了孕，于是就埋怨避孕方法的不可靠，对它丧失信心。
    有些男同志错误地认为养儿育女是妇女的事，孩子生病、教养等问题都有国家负担，和自己的关系不大，因此，不能正确的体会到生育过多过密对母子健康以及对社会主义建设上的不良影响，也就对避孕问题表现的不够积极，不够主动，漠不关心或甚至有抵触情绪。他们只是看到了避孕的不方便、不自由的一面，而却看不出避孕在计划生育、在加速社会主义建设上的积极意义。
    以上这些思想情况是我们在医疗工作中所了解到的。这些思想情况无疑的是推行避孕工作中的一大障碍，必须通过大力、普遍而深入的宣传加以纠正。除了我们医务人员应在宣传工作上作更进一步的努力外，更希望工会、妇联、青联及各有关方面给予大力支持和协助，并通过各种有效的宣传方式进行思想动员，在群众中，特别是在已婚男女中造成避孕的气氛，使每人都能从思想上认识到避孕对于个人利益及国家利益上的重大意义。
    全面、系统地介绍避孕方法
    2．避孕方法的介绍。这项工作是全体医务人员的责任。过去作的是不够全面、不够系统的。同时，在宣传资料上也还存在着不够通俗、不切合实际的缺点。为要大力推广避孕，每个妇产科及泌尿科医师必须首先掌握有关避孕的理论知识和技术操作。各级医疗保健机构，包括医院、诊所、工厂保健站、农村医疗站等处，必须设立避孕技术指导门诊，以便在各级机构都能进行避孕的宣传及技术指导。
    正因避孕方法目前尚未得到人民群众的足够信任，我们在介绍方法时必须特别慎重。只能介绍一些切实可行、可靠而又无害的避孕方法。对一些效果尚未确定或在科学上已经证明为有害的方法是不应轻率的加以介绍的。
    在过去几个月的宣传避孕的过程中，我们发现一种不正常的现象，有些百货公司的橱窗里、街头上都陈列了一些有关避孕的模型和图样，儿童电影院的影幕上也出现了有关避孕方法的说明。我们认为这样不分老少、不分场合、不拘形式的宣传是不妥当的，因为它可能在儿童思想中发生不良的影响；宣传的对象最好仅限于已婚男女。
    二、避孕药品、器材的供应上存在着质量差、数量不足、品种不多等缺点。最近供应情况虽已有了改善，但在质量上，还存在很多问题。目前我国还没有避孕用品鉴定的机构，我们认为需要培养有关的技术人员，成立鉴定机构，保证避孕用品的质量，改进供应。只有这样才能使避孕工作的效果得到物质保证。
    加强对于避孕的科学研究工作
    三、过去避孕的科学研究工作做得是很不够的。现有的避孕方法虽然有效，但是尚不够简便。这些问题都急需大力研究，才能逐步求得解决。最近科学委员会已将避孕的研究列入医学科学研究规划，说明党和政府对避孕问题的高度重视和对人民保健事业的无比关怀。为了保证这项工作的顺利进行，我们还希望各有关方面在人力、物力上大力的给予协助；不仅妇产科、泌尿科医师，而且希望全体医务人员以及药物、生理、化学等有关部门的科学工作人员也参加这项重要研究。在避孕的科学研究工作上，过去我们的经验是不够的，基础也是很差的。今后研究的方向，主要应该是：对其他国家认为有效的新方法进行适当的研究，以迅速取得经验。同时，对中医认为有效的药剂及古方等也应积极进行研究，从科学上证实其效果，以便更好的推广。
    在这里，我们还要提一提有关计划生育的其他几个问题：
    人工流产不是避孕方法
    1．人工流产问题：首先应该肯定的是人工流产不是避孕的方法，相反的，它还会妨碍避孕的推广。根据上海、南京、天津、北京、广州、武汉等地的实际调查，自从公布放宽人工流产的限度以后，避孕门诊的人数显见减少，此外甚至还有人放弃了原用的避孕方法，以为怀孕后反正可以用人工流产来解决问题。这是一个很不好的现象。人工流产毕竟是一个手术，施行手术时可能发生子宫穿通、大出血、感染发炎等危险；因为它是一个违反自然发展的手术，所以手术后，还可能留下因神经及内分泌功能紊乱所引起的症状。我们在诊疗工作中常见到过去作过人工流产的妇女有白带多、腰酸、背痛等慢性症状。这些人工流产的不良影响，是国内外医学家们所共知的，也就是医务人员所以不愿轻易施行人工流产的主要原因。最近各地在这问题上的调查研究也证实了这一点。虽然，我们很不愿意看到这些合并症，并在尽最大努力对它们进行预防，但到目前为止，尚未能找到杜绝这些合并症，特别是后遗症的方法。我们很想劝病人不要作人工流产，但又不愿将上述的危险性及后遗症毫无保留的告诉病人，因为知道这样作，只会增加他们的精神负担，是不合乎保护性医疗制的原则的。
    不能草率采用永久性避孕方法
    2．永久性避孕问题：结扎输卵管或结扎输精管手术，在子女过多的夫妇中或身体不健康的妇女中是可以适当选择应用的，但是这种手术是永久性的避孕方法，因此就不能不分情况草率采用。
    青年不要过早结婚
    3．结婚年龄问题：我国有早婚习惯。解放后，由于生活的改善，在许多青年学生、工人、农民中，早婚情况有增加趋势。这些青年，在婚后往往连续生育，严重地影响了学习、工作、生活及健康，而且对子女也不能尽到教养的责任。因此我们认为有必要在青年中树立不要过早结婚的风气。
    关于推行计划生育的这项工作，过去中央卫生部虽然作了布置，但因缺乏应有的督促和检查，收效是不够理想的。今后，我们希望党和政府加强对这一工作的领导。并希望各位代表在宣传及推广上，大力给予协助，以便早日实现计划生育，加速祖国的社会主义建设，使人民生活能继续不断的提高。
    上述意见，是否妥当，请各位代表指正。
