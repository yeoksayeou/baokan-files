Facts Are the Most Powerful Refutation of Rightists
Chen Yinnan's Written Statement Discusses the First Year of the Establishment of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative

Last year, our Anhui Province, like the rest of the country, achieved agricultural collectivization. The superiority of collectivization has been proven by countless, absolutely true facts. Now, I will only talk about some specific materials from the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs of Hefei City, which I am in contact with.

The Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative has 688 households, more than 3,100 people, and more than 6,300 mu of land. It was transformed from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative in the winter of 1955. Before this, the cooperative was very difficult due to the thin soil and continuous disasters. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, it still lacked production funds, and felt the lack of agricultural tools, fertilizers, and seeds. Some members also had difficulties in their lives. In response to the above situation, the leading cadres of the cooperative first strengthened ideological work to educate the members to overcome difficulties and run the cooperative diligently and frugally. With the consent of the members, the compensation for draft animals and farm tools due to be returned to the members in the first year was temporarily not returned; and private houses were used as warehouses as much as possible, fewer houses were built, and expenses were reduced. Therefore, a lot of expenses were saved, and many difficulties were overcome. In production, production reforms were actively promoted based on local soil quality and water conservancy conditions, superior varieties were selected to increase the yield per unit area. For example, the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato, which was changed to be planted, yielded 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, which was two to three times higher than the local sweet potato; the 31,960 mu of double-cropping rice cultivated yielded an average of more than 400 jin per mu, which was also much higher than single-cropping rice. In addition, sideline production such as pig raising, fish farming, duck raising, chicken raising, and flour making was also carried out. The whole cooperative raised more than 100 sows, and the piglets born were distributed to the members to raise, with an average of three pigs per household, which increased the income of the members. According to the final accounting last year, the whole cooperative harvested a total of 2.8 million jin of grain, an increase of 700,000 jin compared with 1955. The members received more than 600 jin of food grain per person, and each labor force received an average of 202 yuan, with an average of 85 yuan per person. The middle peasants in the cooperative (accounting for about half of the total number of households) all increased their income except for three households whose income decreased; the hired poor peasants all increased their income, and their lives were greatly improved. Here are a few examples:

The hired farmhand Zhao Yuhai, before liberation, his family of three went out begging, with Zhao working as a hired laborer and his wife taking the children to beg for food. After liberation, two more children were added, and 9.5 mu of land were distributed during the land reform, but there was a shortage of plowing cattle, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizer. The annual income was still not enough to cover expenses, and there was a shortage of more than 1,000 jin of food grain, and debts had to be borrowed. In 1953, part of the land was also mortgaged. Last year, he did 6,500 work points in the cooperative, and earned a net income of 201 yuan in addition to food grain. The eldest child entered middle school, and the second child also entered elementary school. Another example is the poor peasant Li Changfu, a family of eight with four laborers, who used to lack food and clothing, and several people shared a tattered cotton quilt. Last year, in addition to the food grain distributed in the cooperative, he also received 596 yuan, and he also raised three pigs, earning a total of 150 yuan, with a total income of 746 yuan. In addition to repairing houses and farm tools, repaying 90 yuan of debt, and making a set of cotton clothes and single clothes for each person during the New Year, and buying a pair of rubber shoes, sneakers, and a thermos bottle, there was still surplus money, and 180 yuan was deposited in the credit cooperative. Another example is Grandma Liu, an 80-year-old blind woman with no children. Now, the cooperative implements the "five guarantees," sending grain and straw monthly, and giving oil and salt. In May, she fell ill, and the members took turns taking care of her for more than 40 days. Usually, everything is done by the cooperative. Another example is the Xiong Yongsheng brothers, a pair of orphans who lost their parents, the older one being 11 years old and the younger one only 9 years old. Now they are both supported by the cooperative, and the older one has also entered school. During the Spring Festival this year, the cooperative made a set of new cotton clothes for each of them and bought a pair of sneakers. The cooperative is their warm family. There are many similar examples in the cooperative.

The above facts show that if collectivization had not been implemented, it would have been fundamentally impossible to develop production so rapidly, improve the lives of farmers, and achieve "the old being cared for and the young being raised." Some rightists in our province maliciously say that "cooperatives are in a mess," "the three reforms have made things worse," and "farmers are living too hard," etc., denying the superiority of agricultural collectivization, denying the great achievements of production reform, and denying the improvement of farmers' lives. This is without any basis. The fact that the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved increased production and income in the first year of its establishment is a powerful refutation of the rightists' reactionary fallacies.

    事实是对右派分子最有力的驳斥
    陈荫南的书面发言谈丰收农业社建社第一年的情况
    去年我们安徽省和全国一样实现了农业合作化。合作化的优越性已经为无数千真万确的事实所证明，现在我只谈谈我所联系的合肥市西郊区丰收农业生产合作社的一些具体材料。
    丰收农业生产合作社共有六百八十八户，三千一百多人，六千三百多亩土地，是一九五五年冬由初级社转为高级社的。在这以前，由于土地瘦薄，加上连年受灾，该社是很困难的。成立高级社后，也还是缺乏生产资金，农具、肥料、种子均感不足，有些社员的生活上也有困难。针对以上情况，社的领导干部首先加强了思想工作，教育社员克服困难，勤俭办社。在社员同意下，将第一年应归还社员的耕畜、农具折价款暂不归还；并尽量借用私人房子作仓库，少盖房子，减少开支。因而就节省了不少费用，克服了很多的困难。在生产上，积极的根据当地土质、水利情况，推行了生产改革，选用优良品种，增加单位面积产量。如改种的“胜利百号”山芋，每亩收二、三千斤，比本地山芋增产两三倍；栽培的三万一千九百六十亩双季稻，每亩平均产量达四百多斤，也比单季稻增产不少。另外，还开展了养猪、养鱼、养鸭、养鸡、做粉等副业生产，全社共养母猪一百多头，生下的小猪分给社员喂养，平均每户养猪达到三头，增加了社员的收入。据去年决分算账，全社共收粮食二百八十万斤，比一九五五年增产七十万斤，社员每人分得口粮六百多斤，每个劳动力平均分得二百零二元，每人平均得八十五元。该社中农（约占全社户数的一半左右）除三户收入有所下降外，大多数都增加了收入；雇贫农则都增加了收入，生活有了很大的改善。这里略举几户为例：
    雇农赵余海，解放前一家三口，赵去帮工，老婆带着孩子讨饭。解放后又添了两个孩子，土改时分田九亩五分，但缺耕牛、农具、种子，肥料也不足，每年收入仍不够支出，缺口粮一千多斤，还要借债，一九五三年并押了一部分田。去年在社里做了六千五百个工分，除口粮外净得二百零一元，大孩子进了中学，二孩子也进了小学。再如贫农李长福，一家八口，四个劳动力，过去缺吃少穿，几个人共盖一床破棉絮，去年在社里除分得的口粮外还分得五百九十六元，自己又养猪三头共得一百五十元，合计收入七百四十六元。除了修理房子、农具，归还九十元的债，过年时每人各做一套棉衣、单衣，并买一双胶鞋、球鞋和热水瓶等开支以外，还有余钱，在信用社存款一百八十元。又如刘老奶奶，是一个八十多岁的瞎子，无儿无女，现在由社实行“五保”，按月送粮、草，给油、盐，五月间她生了病，社员还轮流看顾四十多天，平时什么事也都是社里包做。又如熊永生兄弟，是一对丧失父母的孤儿，大的十一岁，小的才九岁，现在都由社包养，大的还进了学校读书，今年春节时社里给他们每人做了一套新棉衣，买了一双球鞋，社就是他们的温暖的家庭。类似以上事例，在该社还很多。
    以上事实说明，如果不是实行了合作化，要想这样迅速的发展生产，改善农民的生活，做到“老有所安，少有所养”，显然是根本不可能的。我省也有些右派分子心怀恶意的说“合作社搞糟了”、“三改，改坏了”、“农民生活太苦”等等，否认农业合作化的优越性，否认生产改革的巨大成绩，否认农民生活的改善，这是没有任何根据的。上述丰收农业生产合作社在办社头一年就取得增产、增收的事实，就是对右派分子反动谬论的有力驳斥。
