    The People of Xicheng
    Passing through the hot subtropical region of Kaiyuan, crossing the clouds on Huangmao Mountain, what suddenly appears before people's eyes is a large expanse of water among the mountains. This water easily reminds one of the Heavenly Pool on Changbai Mountain, but it is even more beautiful and moving than the Heavenly Pool. This is Gejiu Lake, which the people of Gejiu are proud of. There was no wind that day, and Gejiu Lake was so calm that there wasn't even a ripple. I stood by a small bridge, watching the speeding trucks, the crowds coming and going, and the calm lake. The lake reflected the Yinshan Malage mining area, the pine and cypress trees by the lake, the milky white buildings of the workers on the mountainside, and the chimneys of the factories spewing thick smoke. On this clean lake surface, the red rocks of Yinshan appeared even redder, and the white clouds in the sky appeared even whiter. Ducks floated on the lake, and fish jumped out of the water from time to time, creating ripples. The dark green lotus leaves made the beautiful lake even more beautiful. Whether it is the lake water and the ducks, or the fish and the lotus flowers, they are not surprising in many parts of our country, but the people of Gejiu never dreamed of these things for generations.
    Water, in the past days of the people of Gejiu, how precious it must have been! It was very difficult to get drinking water during the dry season, and a lot of water was also needed for production. Every ton of tin produced required twenty-five tons of water; every meter of drilling required many tons of water. In the past, water was as precious as gold. Before 1954, Gejiu Tin Mine once proposed not to waste a drop of water in order to produce more tin, but some production units still had to stop production during the dry season. In the summer of 1954, mountain floods brought a major flood to Gejiu. In order to completely solve the water problem for the people's lives and production in Gejiu, Soviet experts suggested building an artificial lake. This suggestion was adopted. The people of Gejiu actively participated in the construction of this artificial lake. Now, Gejiu Tin Mine will no longer have to stop production due to water shortage; the people of Gejiu will no longer have to not wash their faces or take baths due to water shortage.
    Those who come to Gejiu, if they go to the bottom of the tin mine to take a look, will truly feel the happiness of the miners' lives. As soon as I arrived in the mine, the first thing I heard was the workers humming the tune of "Lanhua Hua." This tune, mixed with the sound of the electric cars pulling ore and the sound of the flowing water in the mine, made it sound particularly beautiful. We walked along the tunnel illuminated by electric lights, heading towards the farthest part of the mining area, constantly encountering electric cars and horse-drawn carts loaded with ore along the way. Water flowed gurgling in the small ditches by the roadside. Sometimes we encountered houses for repairing tools and medical clinics for temporary treatment. The electric lights in these small houses were particularly bright. Every worker was happily busy striving to overfulfill the production tasks. It was difficult to find some time for them. We talked to several workers during their blasting breaks. One worker said, "Look at our mine, you can grab a handful of soil here and it can be exchanged for five handfuls of rice." Another worker said, "But our Second District has never completed the mining task in the past, and accidents often occurred. In the past few months, we have overfulfilled the task every month." Speaking of this, a worker pointed to a worker next to me and said, "Since Li Zilin came, this backward label has been removed." Before Li Zilin came, the task of their Second District was 250 carts per day, but they couldn't even complete 100 carts. Li Zilin, as the district chief, was different from the original district chief. He ran in the tunnels with the workers every day. When the workers had no way to solve the problem, he personally helped the workers. At that time, Li Zilin saw that the organization of the Second District was chaotic, and the workers were afraid of accidents and dared not mine boldly, because the mined areas were not filled with stone slag. However, the stones mined in the Second District had to be transported to a very far place. Li Zilin discussed with the workers in the Second District and drilled a hole between the mining team and the prospecting team, so that the mining team had stones to fill. After the filling problem was solved, collapse accidents still occurred frequently. Li Zilin discussed with the workers and put some heart-piercing sticks in the places where it was easy to collapse. Since then, collapse accidents have been reduced, and this month their Second District completed the task four days ahead of schedule. The second month, the third month... until now they can complete the production tasks well. A worker said, "Old man, say something!" Li Zilin didn't say a word, just stared at me with wide eyes. He didn't have the usual joy and laughter, he just said, "Comrade, go up and take a look at the cableway. This cableway was designed by ourselves and installed by our own machines." Speaking of this, he smiled slightly. Then I and they walked through the pit caves like city streets and took the elevator to the ground.
    On the ground is another tense scene. The ore is transported from hundreds of meters below the mountain, across several peaks, to the concentrator. This section of transportation is done by cableway, which the employees call the throat to complete the task. The iron buckets carry the ore quickly through the air to the concentrator. It runs automatically in the air regardless of wind or rain. It rings day and night. It and the sound of the underground electric car make up a song of tense labor. Here, the flying buckets are evenly transported one after another to the other side of the mountain. On this long cableway, the wisdom and perseverance of the tin miners are displayed. Originally, it was difficult to meet the state's requirements for producing large amounts of tin because of the lack of transportation tools, but the employees here racked their brains to transport the ore to the concentrator as soon as possible and to save the country's funds on transportation. In this way, a unprecedented long cableway would be built in Chinese history. When the cableway was completed, it brought new difficulties to the employees here. The biggest difficulty was that there were many accidents. The steel cable broke today, and it broke again tomorrow. The time of work was less than the time of accidents. The people who repaired the cableway ran along the cableway on the mountain day and night, regardless of rain or hail. The heads of the steel cables were connected more and more, and the accidents were more and more. What should be done? Finally, the workers used the method of leaving hemp cores when connecting the heads, which greatly reduced the number of accidents.
    At that time, those who worked in the driver's room of the aerial cableway were all novices. Most of them were young people who had just put down their hoes from the countryside and were not familiar with the operation. However, these young people learned quickly. Take Pu Zifa, a young Yi man, for example. When he first came to the driver's room, he didn't know how to operate the machine, let alone how to make a phone call. During those days of many accidents, Pu Zifa stood by the teacher day and night, and he checked the machine whenever it stopped. In order to master the technology, he turned his face yellow and his eyes red. Now, he hasn't had an accident for more than thirty months.
    It's so interesting to watch by the cableway! The flying buckets on the cableway automatically fly past the ups and downs of the mountain, carrying the ore to the concentrator.
    That enthusiastic sound from the foot of Yinshan that never stops all night is the concentrator. The ore from the cableway from the other side of the mountain is washed out of tin with water here. In the multi-story machine room, the shaking tables are shaking, the iron mills are rolling, and clear water is evenly poured on the ore. On the shaking table, you can clearly see a layer of glittering spots, which is tin. Because the employees launched a competition, even the slightest bit of experience was summed up. As early as last year, the production volume of the large mill was twice that of before liberation.
    In the place where the chimneys are towering at the foot of Yangshan, the flames of the smelting furnace are burning fiercely. Here, you can see the dazzling tin being smelted. By the smelting furnace, the workers are turning the flames with long fire sticks. The eye-stabbing flames are constantly喷喷ing out of the furnace door. You will feel the heat by the furnace, the heat of our workers. Li Peiran, that little old man, has been by the furnace for more than ten years. He was originally a No. 4 furnace worker, but no matter what problem there was with that furnace, he would take the initiative to run over to solve it. Last year, there was a problem with the use of hot air in No. 3 furnace, which often damaged the furnace. This made Li Peiran unable to sleep for several nights. At night, his old partner brought him pot after pot of tea, and he smoked one cigarette after another, or else he walked four square steps in the yard. Four or five days later, he suddenly jumped up happily. He thought of installing a baffle in the air duct to adjust the air volume, and the problem of using hot air could be solved. He asked his old partner to buy some wine and meat, had a good meal, and went to the factory. He experimented on No. 3 furnace for a day, and the smelting time was shortened by three hours, and half a ton of coal could be saved per hour. Li Peiran said, "What else do I want in today's society? My mind is just thinking about the furnace, just thinking about smelting more tin and saving more coal." In this old worker, you will feel that his enthusiasm for socialist construction is even hotter than the heat of that thousand-degree furnace.

    锡城的人们
    穿过炎热的开远亚热带地区，穿过黄茅山上的云，突然出现人们眼前的是那群山之间的一大片水，这片水，很容易使人想起长白山上的天池，可是它却比天池更优美，更动人。这就是个旧的人们引为骄傲的个旧湖。这天没有风，个旧湖水平静得连点波纹都没有。我在一个小桥边看着疾驰而过的载重卡车，看着来来往往的人群，看着平静的湖水。那湖水里，映照着阴山上马拉格矿区的倒影，湖边的松树和柏树，山腰间乳白色的职工的楼房和那工厂里吐着浓烟的烟囱，在这洁净的湖面上，阴山的红岩显得更红，天上的白云显得更白。鸭群在湖面上飘游，鱼儿不时的从水里跳出来，掀起点浪花。深绿的荷叶使这美丽的湖面显得更美。不管是湖水和鸭群，也不管是鱼儿和荷花，在我们国家的很多地方并不足为奇，但是个旧的人们世世代代做梦也不曾想到过这些东西。
    水，在个旧人们过去的日子里，该是多么的可贵呀！在干旱的季节里吃水就很困难，生产上也要用许多水。每生产一吨锡就要二十五吨水；每钻探一公尺也要好多吨水。在过去真是水贵如金。1954年以前，个旧锡矿为了生产更多的锡，曾经提出过不浪费一滴水，可是有的生产单位在枯水季节里还是不得不停止了生产。1954年的夏天，山洪给个旧带来了大水灾。苏联专家为了彻底解决个旧人民生活和生产的用水，提议建造一个人工湖。这个建议被采纳了。个旧市的人民积极参加了这座人工湖的建设。现在，个旧锡矿再也不会因为缺水而停止生产了；个旧的人们再也不会因为缺水而不洗脸、不洗澡了。
    到个旧的人，如果到锡矿的底层看看，那才会真正地感到矿工生活的快乐。我一到矿坑里最先听到的就是工人哼哼蓝花花的曲子。这曲子混和在拉矿砂的电动车的声音里，混和在矿下的流水声里，使人觉得特别动听。我们沿着电灯照亮的坑道走着，向着那矿区最远的地方走去，沿途不断的和满载着矿砂的电动车、马拉车相遇。水在路边的小沟沟里哗哗的流着。有时碰到修配工具的房子和实行临时治疗的医疗所。这些小房子里电灯特别光亮。每个工人都在愉快地忙着争取超额完成生产任务。叫他们找出点时间是困难的，我们在他们放炮休息的时候找了几个工人谈了话。一个工人说：“看看咱们这个矿吧，你随便在我们这里抓一把土，它就可换回五把米来。”另一个工人说：“可是我们二区过去从来就没完成过采矿任务，还老出事故。这几个月来，月月超额”。说到这里，有个工人指了指我旁边的一个工人说：“从李自林来后，这个落后帽子就摘掉了。”李自林没有来以前，他们二区的任务是每天二百五十车，可是他们连一百车也完不成。李自林当区长和原来的区长不一样，他和工人一样天天在坑道里跑。当工人没办法的时候他就亲自帮助工人干。那时，李自林看着二区的组织紊乱，工人怕出事故不敢大胆的采矿，原因就是采了的地方没有石碴充填。可是，在二区探矿打出来的石头却要运到很远的地方去。李自林和二区的工人商量，在采矿组和探矿组间打了个洞洞，就使采矿组有石头充填了。充填的问题解决了，蹋方的事故还经常出现。李自林和工人商量，在容易塌的地方打些穿心棍子，从此以后塌方事故少了，这个月他们二区提前四天完成了任务。第二个月，第三个月……直到现在他们都能很好地完成生产任务。有个工人说：“老头说说吧！”李自林没吱声，只是圆睁着眼睛看着我。他没有平常人的喜笑，他只是说：“同志，你到上面看看索道吧，这索道是我们自己设计，又是我们自己的机器装置起来的。”说到这里他才微微的笑了笑。然后我和他们一块儿穿过像城市街道般的坑洞，乘升降机到地面上来。
    在地面是另一个紧张的场面。矿砂从几百公尺的山下运出来，经过几个山峰运到选矿厂。这段运输用的就是索道，职工们称它为完成任务的咽喉。铁兜从空中把矿砂飞快地运到选矿厂去，不管刮风和下雨它都自动地在空中飞跑着。它黑天白日的在响。它和地下电车的响声凑成一个紧张劳动的曲子。在这里，飞兜均匀的一个接着一个运到山的那边。就在这条绵长的索道上，显示了锡矿工人的智慧和毅力。原先因为运输工具不够，很难完成国家生产大锡的要求，可是这里的职工们绞尽了脑汁，要把矿砂尽快地运到选矿厂去，并且要在运输上给国家节省资金。这样就要在中国历史上建造一条空前的长索道。当索道建成以后，随着又给这里的职工带来了新的困难。最大的困难是事故多。钢索今天断了，明天又断了，工作的时间没有出事故的时间多。修理索道的人们，黑夜白天沿着索道在山上跑，不管是下雨，也不管是下冰雹。钢索的头儿越接越多，事故也越来越多。到底该怎么办呢？最后，工人们在接头时用留麻心的办法使事故大大减少了。
    那时，在驾空索道司机室工作的，都是些新手，他们多数是刚从农村放下锄头的小青年，不熟悉操作。然而，这些小青年学得很快。就拿彝族小青年普自发来说吧，他刚来驾驶室时，别说开机器，就是连电话也不知怎么打。普自发在那事故多的日子里，日日夜夜地站在老师的旁边，机器一停，他就检查。为了掌握技术，他把脸儿熬黄了，眼睛熬红了。现在，他已经三十多个月没发生事故。
    你在索道旁看看该是多么有趣味呀！索道上飞兜唰唰的沿着山峰的高低自动地飞过去，把矿砂运到选矿厂。
    那来自阴山麓彻夜不停的热烈的声音就是选矿厂。从山的那边由索道来的矿砂都经这里用水把锡洗出来。在那数层高的机器房里，摇床在摇动着，铁磨在滚动着，清水均匀地浇着矿砂。在摇床上你可以清楚地看到一层闪着光芒的点点，那就是锡。由于职工们展开了竞赛，那怕是点滴的经验都总结出来，早在去年大磨生产量比解放前提高了两倍。
    在阳山麓那烟囱高耸的地方，炼炉的烈焰正在熊熊地燃烧着。在这里，你可以看到耀人眼睛的锡被炼出来。在炼炉旁，工人们拿着长长的火棍翻弄着烈火。那刺人眼睛的火舌不断地从炉门中喷出来，你在炉火旁站会感到那股热力，我们工人的热力。李沛然那个小老头在炉火旁已经十几年了。他本是四号烧炉工人，可是不管那个炉子上有了问题，他都会主动地跑过去解决，去年三号炉子上使用热风有问题，常把炉子烧坏。这使李沛然几夜睡不着觉。夜里，他的老伴给他提一壶茶又一壶茶，他是一支烟又一支烟的接着抽，再不然就是在院子里走四方步。四五天后，他突然高兴得跳起来了，他想到在风管里按个插板来调剂风量，热风的使用问题就可解决。他叫老伴买了点酒、肉，痛痛快快的吃了一顿就到工厂里去了。他在三号炉试验了一天，冶炼的时间缩短了三个小时，并且每小时可节约半吨煤。李沛然说：“现在的社会我还想什么呢，我的脑子里就是想炉子，就是想法多炼锡，多节省煤。”在这个老工人的身上你会感到，他对社会主义的建设热情，真比那一千度的炉火的热力还热。
