Rightists' Fabrication of False Letters to Incite Trouble Thoroughly Exposed by Guangzhou No. 1 Middle School Teachers and Students

(Our Dispatch) Recently, several middle schools in Guangzhou discovered that some rightists, fearing that the world was not in chaos, took advantage of the relatively tense situation of this year's entrance examinations to distribute reactionary letters and incite students to make trouble. The rightists' conspiracy activities have been closely watched and resolutely countered by students and educational workers.

Guangzhou No. 1 Middle School's Senior 3 class received a letter signed "All Senior 3 Students of Suzhou No. 1 Middle School." The letter stated: "...The Ministry of Higher Education has decided that graduates of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools who have a score of four or more can be admitted to universities without examination, which means that some people enjoy privileges." The letter also said, "We should pay great attention to this issue, and we should and must take unified action."

This letter caused ideological confusion among some students, but some people suspected the authenticity of the news and immediately handed the letter over to the school. After investigation, it was found that this was actually a conspiracy by rightists to incite students to make trouble. This Suzhou letter, which claimed to be "reliable news and facts," was originally fabricated by two rightist elements from Tongji University in Shanghai: Sheng Jianru, an assistant teacher in the Department of Architectural Engineering, and Chi Wenxin, a student in the Department of Railway Engineering. In fact, the education departments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangzhou have all decided that graduates of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools will not be recommended this year.

After the truth was revealed, the students felt greatly educated by this incident. Some students said: We almost fell for the rightists' trick!

    右派分子捏造假信煽动闹事被广州一中师生彻底揭穿
    本报讯　最近广州市几所中学先后发现有唯恐天下不乱的右派分子利用今年升学问题比较紧张的机会，散发反动信件，煽动学生闹事。右派分子这种阴谋活动，已严密注意并遭到学生和教育工作者的坚决回击。
    广州第一中学高三班曾收到一封署名“苏州市第一中学全体高三同学”的信，信中说：“……高教部决定工农速成中学毕业生，凡成绩满四分以上者，可免试送入高等学校，它意味着某些人享受特权”，信中还说“应该对这个问题加以极大注意，我们应该而且有必要采取一致的行动”。
    这封信曾引起一些学生思想上的混乱，但也有人怀疑这消息的真实性，当即把这封信交给学校。后经查明，实际是右派分子煽动学生闹事的一个阴谋。这封自称是“可靠消息和事实”的苏州来信，原是上海同济大学两个右派分子——建筑工业系助教盛剑如、铁道系学生迟文信捏造的。而事实上，上海、江苏、广州的教育部门都已决定，各工农速成中学毕业生今年一律不保送。
    真相大白之后，同学们都觉得从这件事中受到很大教育，有些同学说：差一点上了右派分子的当！
