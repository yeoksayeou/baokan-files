    Liberation Daily Editorial: Deepen the Debate on the Issue of Newspaper Management Line
    How to run a socialist news undertaking well? This question has not been completely resolved in Shanghai's journalistic circles. The bourgeois ideology of running newspapers still has a deep-rooted influence among a considerable portion of news workers in Shanghai. At the slightest sign of trouble, there's immediate reaction. Therefore, when bourgeois right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on Shanghai's news undertakings, Wenhui Daily, for a period, transformed into a bourgeois political direction. Furthermore, some newspapers and journalism departments in universities, although not toppled by the wild winds of bourgeois newspaper management ideology like Wenhui Daily, were also blinded by flying sand and stones. This was not accidental; it was precisely because Shanghai's journalistic circles not only had an external environment suitable for the right-wing elements' frenzied attacks but also possessed internal conditions that allowed poisonous bacteria to breed. Consequently, some people in Shanghai's journalistic circles, for a period, completely lost their ability to distinguish right from wrong, even following the tide, regarding poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers, and becoming prisoners of the right-wing elements' anti-socialist newspaper management program. This lesson is extremely painful. Therefore, the ongoing great debate in Shanghai's journalistic circles is not only necessary to repel the right-wing's frenzied attacks but even more necessary for the continued transformation of the majority of good people in the journalistic circles. Shanghai's news workers should, through this struggle, sharpen their eyes, learn from the lessons, thoroughly transform themselves, and only in this way can they shatter the bourgeois right-wing elements' ambition to stage a comeback and firmly establish their position in wholeheartedly striving to run socialist news undertakings well.
    In recent months, bourgeois right-wing elements, in order to seize the people's news front, have spread a large number of bourgeois reactionary newspaper management ideologies. Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, they have desperately vilified the Party's newspapers and the people's newspapers, slanderously claiming that the people's newspapers have "the face of a Party member," "teach with a stern face," and are "a voice of dogmatism," insisting that readers can only "meekly agree" with the Party's newspapers, and that "a high wall has been built between the newspaper and the readers," and so on. Under the banner of anti-dogmatism, the right-wing elements further vilified the Party and the government's leadership over the news undertaking as dogmatic leadership. They cursed that the Party had caused some newspapers to "almost be ruined by dogmatism," and that some newspapers were run "half-dead and lifeless." What was the ultimate purpose of the right-wing elements' fierce attacks on "dogmatism"? Now the truth is out. Originally, their attack on "dogmatism" was just an excuse; their purpose was to negate the historically proven fact that the news undertaking is a tool of class struggle, to oppose the socialist news undertaking's responsibility to serve the defense and consolidation of the socialist foundation, and to overthrow Lenin's assertion that the newspaper is "not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator but also a collective organizer." In the final analysis, it was to abolish the function of newspapers in publicizing Marxism-Leninism and socialism in order to pave the way for the widespread dissemination of bourgeois ideology.
    Right-wing elements are most adept at sophistry. They might say: It is a matter of course that newspapers serve politics and that newspapers publicize socialism, and we have never opposed it. We only oppose preaching with a stern face, only oppose talking about guidance all the time, and only oppose dogmatism that is divorced from the masses. How can you say that we negate the news undertaking as a tool of class struggle? It is true that they have never openly said such things, and they will never say these "stupid things" before they have seized political leadership. They do not say it, but they know it in their hearts, because what they are doing is a conspiracy. However, conspiracies can be seen through, the cloven hoof will always be revealed, and no amount of sophistry can deny it. For example, at the Central Propaganda Conference, it was clearly proposed to oppose both dogmatism that affirms everything and revisionism that negates everything, but Xu Zhucheng, Lu Yi, Xu Junyuan, and the like only attacked "dogmatism" on all occasions and never mentioned opposing revisionism; the Central Propaganda Conference clearly proposed the importance of strengthening political and ideological work and criticized the current weakness of political work among intellectuals, but they only desperately attacked preaching with a stern face and never said how newspapers should improve and strengthen the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and how they should strengthen the struggle against bourgeois ideology; their opposition to "dogmatism" is completely different from our opposition to dogmatism. We oppose dogmatism in order to do a better job of publicizing Marxism-Leninism, and they oppose "dogmatism" in order to abolish the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism. We oppose dogmatism in news work in order to more vividly and powerfully publicize the earth-shattering socialist transformation and socialist construction that the people of the whole country are carrying out, and they oppose "dogmatism" in news work in order to oppose singing the praises of socialism, for the sake of the restoration of capitalism and the revival of bourgeois freedom of the press. Hasn't Xu Junyuan already clearly exposed his true colors? He said that the Dagongbao, which served the reactionaries before liberation, was a friend of the readers, while the People's Daily after liberation is not a friend of the readers. If it is not a friend of the readers, then what is it? The word "enemy" is just unspoken. Since they regard the people's newspapers as enemies, then why would they oppose dogmatism in order to better publicize Marxism-Leninism? Why would they be wholeheartedly thinking that the great plan is near, and therefore, blinded by greed, they would do their utmost to usurp and utilize newspapers for the bourgeois right-wing elements?
    The right-wing elements' attack on the people's news undertaking always incessantly boasts about how important the tradition of the news undertaking is and attacks the "dogmatists" for ignoring tradition. Isn't ignoring tradition a great crime? They talk about tradition in flowery language, making it sound beautiful. What exactly are the traditions of China's modern news undertaking? They have never made it clear. The tradition they talk about is "literati running newspapers," what "interestingness," etc. All of these, when exposed, are using the name of tradition to promote their set of bourgeois news viewpoints. In order to refute the right-wing's fallacies, we should study what traditions China's modern news undertaking actually has. How should we treat these traditions? This work awaits the future efforts of news workers. But in its most important point, China's modern news undertaking, in the democratic revolution period, was an important tool in the struggle between the democrats and the reactionaries. From the end of the Qing Dynasty, all newspapers run by democrats were for the purpose of advocating national revolution and democratic revolution, among which the newspapers run by revolutionary democrats vigorously advocated the new democratic revolution under the leadership of the working class and sang praises for the socialist future; all the royalist party and reactionaries also ran many newspapers, but all were for the purpose of opposing the people's democratic revolution and propagating the deceptive "gospel" of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Why do the right-wing elements confuse the distinction between these two types of newspapers with completely opposite natures that existed in history and speak of tradition in general terms? Their purpose is to have us accept the tradition of reactionary newspapers. Xu Zhucheng's praise of "literati running newspapers" is a praise of the Dagongbao run by Zhang Jiluan, who was valued by the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek and who called himself a national hero; Xu Junyuan also praises this reactionary newspaper, which was more vicious than the Kuomintang's Central Daily News during the Chinese democratic revolution period. Can the Chinese people accept this tradition? No, we cannot accept it. We should first thoroughly negate the tradition of bourgeois newspapers, and on the basis of thorough negation, carefully study and select some technical things that are beneficial to the people's news undertaking. Without a thorough negation, one cannot absorb the nutrients that are truly beneficial to the people. We know that among the newspapers with glorious revolutionary traditions in the democratic revolution period, there is a distinction between the revolutionary newspapers run by the Communist Party and the progressive newspapers run by non-Communists. The newspapers run by the Communist Party have extremely important and extremely rich experiences and traditions, which are high ideological character, combativeness, truthfulness, and mass character, as well as the character and style of revolutionary news workers who, through serious self-transformation, have established the spirit of diligently serving the people. Because the history of the working class running newspapers is not very long, and the people running newspapers are restricted by various historical conditions in terms of mastering cultural and scientific knowledge, and their knowledge is not rich enough, the Party's newspapers are not lively enough and lack vigor, and the newspapers still have the defect of being dry. These shortcomings must be corrected by the Party's newspapers in the future. However, the tradition of the Party's newspapers is the tradition that must first be learned when running socialist newspapers today. The bourgeois right-wing elements completely obliterate these traditions and call them all "dogmatism," which is their class instinct at work. The good experiences of non-Party democratic newspapers should be absorbed, and the advantages of their newspapers being run more lively and vigorously should be learned. But it also has bad things that should be discarded. It cannot be affirmed in general terms, nor can it be negated in general terms. The best tradition of non-Party democratic newspapers is to accept the leadership of the Party and the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Precisely because they accepted the leadership of the Party, they were able to stand on the side of the people, stand on the side of justice, and fight vigorously against all reactionary forces and reactionary ideas; it is commendable that some non-Party news workers have the backbone of being unyielding in the face of power and wealth, and some even gave their lives for the people's cause. However, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has its vacillation, and so do the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Some democratic newspapers often show weakness and hesitation in accepting the leadership of the Party at major historical junctures, and even lose the line between right and wrong and fall into the wrong quagmire when the reactionary forces are once rampant. This can only be accepted as a negative lesson. If we do not have an analytical attitude towards the tradition of the news undertaking, we will not be able to accept the true tradition, and we will not be able to see through the right-wing elements' conspiracy to talk about tradition.
    The most fundamental condition for distinguishing between socialist news undertakings and bourgeois news undertakings lies in what ideas it publicizes, what it opposes, and what it supports. Although this is not equal to the whole of the newspaper, it is the soul of the newspaper. The second is to see who leads it, whether it is led by the working class through the Communist Party or by other classes. Although the right-wing elements in the journalistic circles once pretended to say that the newspaper should be led by the Party; in fact, they do not want the leadership of the Party. They want to negate the leadership of the Party with the mass character of the newspaper. They said: If there is leadership in mind, the newspaper will not be run well; if there are masses, it will be run lively and vigorously. Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University, had maliciously attacked the Party spirit of the newspaper. He said that the Party spirit of the newspaper is "the Party committee spirit" or "the Party committee secretary spirit." They repeatedly demanded to run "fellow newspapers." What is a "fellow newspaper"? It is to squeeze out Party member news workers. Therefore, Xu Zhucheng, who chanted the slogan of "fellow newspapers," wanted to promote expelling Party members as an experience of demolishing walls. They also repeatedly insisted that news workers now have no freedom and wanted to restore the authority of news reporters as "uncrowned kings." Aren't these words and deeds enough to prove that their so-called sincerity for the Party's leadership is completely hypocritical?
    The faces of the right-wing elements in the journalistic circles who usurped the leadership of the news undertaking and changed the political direction of the newspaper have been successively exposed; the countless evils committed by the right-wing elements in the journalistic circles have been exposed in large numbers; their frenzied attack has failed, and the anti-rightist struggle in the journalistic circles has achieved initial victory. However, the debate between the two roads in the news undertaking is only just beginning, and the bourgeois newspaper management viewpoint must be seriously and thoroughly criticized. With the right-wing as a negative teacher and with countless facts and lessons, we believe that every serious news worker can benefit from this debate.

    解放日报社论：深入开展办报路线问题的辩论
    如何办好社会主义的新闻事业？这个问题在上海新闻界并未完全解决。资产阶级的办报思想，在上海相当大的一部分新闻工作者中，还有根深蒂固的影响。一有风吹，就有草动。所以，当资产阶级右派分子对上海新闻事业展开猖狂进攻的时候，文汇报就在一个时期内变为资产阶级的政治方向。此外，尚有一些报纸和大学中新闻系，虽然不像文汇报那样被资产阶级办报思想的狂风所刮倒，但是也被飞沙走石迷了眼睛。这不是偶然的事情，正是因为上海新闻界不仅有一个适应于右派分子猖狂进攻的外部环境，也同时具备了一个使毒菌能够繁殖的内部条件。因此，上海新闻界有一些人在一个时期，完全失去辨别能力，甚至随波逐流，把毒草看成香花，做了右派分子的反社会主义的办报纲领的俘虏。这个教训是十分惨重的。那末，可见上海新闻界正在进行的这场大辩论，就打退右派的猖狂进攻来说固然有其必要，而对新闻界大多数好人继续进行改造来说更有必要。上海的新闻工作者，应该通过这场斗争，擦亮眼睛，吸取教训，彻底改造自己，只有这样，才能粉碎资产阶级右派分子卷土重来的野心，才能坚定全心全意为办好社会主义新闻事业而奋斗的立场。
    最近几个月来，资产阶级右派分子为了夺取人民的新闻阵地，散布了大量资产阶级的反动办报思想。他们在反对教条主义的旗帜的掩盖之下，拚命丑化党报和人民的报纸，污蔑人民的报纸是“一副党员面孔”，是“板着面孔说教”，是“一片教条主义的声音”，硬说读者对着党报只能“唯唯诺诺”，“报纸与读者之间筑了一堵高墙”等等。右派分子在反教条主义的大纛之下，进一步污蔑党和政府对新闻事业的领导是教条主义的领导。他们咒骂党使一些报纸“几乎被教条主义害得家破人亡”，使一些报纸办得“奄奄一息毫无生气”。右派分子这样猛烈攻击“教条主义”，究竟为了什么目的？现在真相大白了。原来他们攻击“教条主义”不过是一种借口，其目的是要否定新闻事业是阶级斗争工具这一久经历史证明的事实，是要反对掉社会主义的新闻事业应为保卫与巩固社会主义的基础服务这一职责，是要推翻列宁所说的报纸“不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且是集体的组织者”的作用。归根结蒂是要取消报纸宣传马克思列宁主义、宣传社会主义的功能，以便替大量散布资产阶级思想开辟道路。
    右派分子最会狡赖。他们会说：报纸为政治服务，报纸要宣传社会主义，是天经地义的，早已不在话下，我们从来没有反对过，我们只是反对板起面孔说教，只是反对天天谈指导性，只是反对脱离群众的教条主义而已，怎么可以说我们否定新闻事业是阶级斗争工具呢？一点不错，他们确实没有公开讲过这类话，他们在政治上的领导权未曾取到手以前，永远也不会讲这些“蠢话”的。他们口里不讲，心里有数，因为他们干的是阴谋。不过阴谋也是可以识破的，马脚总是要露出来的，一味狡赖也赖不掉。例如：在中央宣传会议上，明明提出既要反对肯定一切的教条主义，又要反对否定一切的修正主义，但是徐铸成、陆诒、许君远之流在所有场合只是攻击“教条主义”，绝口不谈反对修正主义；中央宣传会议明明提出加强政治思想工作的重要性，批判了目前知识分子中政治工作的薄弱状态，然而他们只是拚命攻击板着面孔说教，从来不说报纸应该如何改善和加强马克思列宁主义思想的宣传，应该如何加强与资产阶级思想作斗争；他们反“教条主义”与我们反教条主义是完全不同的。我们反对教条主义，是为了把马克思列宁主义的宣传工作做得更好，他们反对“教条主义”，是为了取消马克思列宁主义的宣传。我们反对新闻工作中的教条主义，是为了更生动有力地宣传全国人民正在进行的社会主义改造及社会主义建设这件震古铄今的大事业，他们反对新闻工作的“教条主义”，是为了反对歌社会主义之德，是为了资本主义的复辟以及资产阶级新闻自由的复活。许君远不是已经清清楚楚把他的面貌暴露了吗？他说解放以前为反动派御用的大公报是读者的朋友，解放以后的人民日报不是读者的朋友。不是读者的朋友又是什么？“敌人”两字不过是未说出口而已。既然视人民的报纸为敌，那末，他们反教条主义，哪里是为了更好地宣传马列主义呢？哪里是为了使新闻事业更好为社会主义建设与改造服务呢？不过是一心一意以为鸿鹄将至，因此利令智昏地来为资产阶级右派分子篡夺和利用报纸大卖其力罢了。
    右派分子对人民新闻事业的进攻，总是呶呶不休地夸说新闻事业的传统如何重要，攻击“教条主义”者如何忽视传统。忽视传统岂不是一个大罪名吗？他们把传统讲得天花乱坠，美不胜收。究竟中国近代新闻事业有些什么传统，他们从来没有讲清楚过。他们讲的传统是什么“文人办报”，什么“趣味性”等等，所有这些，拆穿了说，是借传统之名，行宣传他们那套资产阶级的新闻观点之实。为了批驳右派的谬论，我们应该研究一下中国近代新闻事业到底有些什么传统。我们究竟应该如何来对待这些传统。这个工作有待于新闻工作者今后的努力。可是就其最重要之点而谈，中国近代新闻事业，在民主革命时期，是民主派和反动派斗争的重要工具。从清朝末年起，一切民主派办的报纸，都是为的鼓吹民族革命、民主革命，其中革命民主主义者办的报纸极力鼓吹在工人阶级领导之下的新民主主义革命，并为社会主义的远景而讴歌；一切保皇党、反动派也办了许多报纸，但都是为了反对人民民主革命，宣传帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的那套骗人“福音”。右派分子为什么混淆历史上存在过的这两种性质完全相反的报纸的区别，笼统地说传统呢？他们的目的，是要我们去接受反动报纸的传统。徐铸成歌颂的“文人办报”，就是歌颂为帝国主义、蒋介石所赏识的、自称为国士无双的张季鸾所办的大公报；许君远所歌颂的也是这张在中国民主革命时期比国民党的中央日报还要恶毒的反动报纸。中国人民能接受这份传统吗？不能接受。我们对资产阶级的报纸的传统首先应该加以彻底否定，在彻底否定的基础上，再来慎重地加以研究、挑选，吸取一些技术性质的有益于人民新闻事业的东西。不抱彻底否定的态度是吸取不到真正有益于人民的营养的。我们知道，在民主革命时期具有光辉革命传统的报纸中，又有共产党办的革命报纸和非共产党办的进步报纸之别。共产党办的报纸有极其重要的极其丰富的经验和传统，这就是高度的思想性、战斗性、真实性和群众性，以及革命新闻工作者由于经过严重的自我改造因而树立的那种勤勤恳恳的为人民服务的品格与作风。由于工人阶级办报的历史还不很长，办报的人在掌握文化科学知识方面还受到各种历史条件的限制，知识不够丰富，因而党报办得不生动，欠活泼，报纸还存在枯燥的毛病，这些缺点，是党报今后必须努力加以改正的。但是，党报的传统是今天办社会主义报纸时首先须要学习的传统，资产阶级右派分子一笔抹煞这些传统，统统称之为“教条主义”，这是他们的阶级本能在作怪。非党的民主报纸的好经验，应该吸收，它们报纸办得比较生动活泼的优点应该学习。但是它也有不好的东西，应该抛弃。既不能笼统肯定，也不能笼统否定。非党的民主报纸最好的传统是接受党的领导、马克思列宁主义的领导。正由于接受了党的领导，它们就能够站在人民这一边，站在正义这一边，有声有色地与一切反动势力、反动思想作斗争；令人可感的是，有一些非党的新闻工作者那种威武不能屈、富贵不能淫的骨气，有的人甚至为了人民事业献出了自己的生命。但是，中国民族资产阶级是有其动摇性的，资产阶级及小资产阶级的知识分子也是如此，有一些民主报纸在重大的历史关头，对接受党的领导常常表现出软弱与彷徨，甚至在反动势力一度嚣张的时候，失去是非界线，跌落到错误的泥坑中去。这只能作为反面的教训来接受。如果我们对待新闻事业的传统不抱一个分析的态度，就接受不到真正的传统，也就不能识破右派分子讲传统的阴谋诡计。
    区别社会主义新闻事业和资产阶级新闻事业的最基本条件，在于它宣传的是什么思想，反对什么，拥护什么。尽管这不等于报纸的全部，但这是报纸的灵魂。其次是看由谁来领导，是工人阶级通过共产党来领导，还是由别的阶级领导。新闻界的右派分子虽然曾经假意地说报纸要有党来领导；其实，他们是不要党的领导的。他们想用报纸的群众性来否定党的领导。他们说：心目中一有了领导，报纸就办不好；一有了群众，就办得生动活泼。复旦大学新闻系主任王中曾对报纸的党性进行过恶毒的攻击。他说报纸的党性就是“党委性”或者是“党委书记性”。他们一再要求办“同人报”。何谓“同人报”？就是把党员新闻工作者排挤出去。所以高唱“同人报”的徐铸成要把排挤党员作为拆墙经验来加以推广。他们还一再硬说现在的新闻工作者没有自由，并要恢复新闻记者“无冕之王”的威权。这些言行，难道还不足以证明他们口中的所谓要有党的领导的全盘虚伪吗？
    篡夺新闻事业的领导权、改变报纸政治方向的新闻界右派分子的面貌，已经陆续被揭露了；右派分子在新闻界所制造的无数恶行，已经大量地被揭发出来了；他们的猖狂进攻已经失败，新闻界反右派斗争已经获得初步胜利。但是新闻事业中两条道路的争论，现在还仅仅是开始，对于资产阶级办报观点，还必须予以严肃彻底的批判。我们面前有了右派这个反面的老师，有了无数的事实教训，我们相信每一个严肃的新闻工作者，都能在这场争辩中得到教益。
