The season for the famous Jinhua ham, both domestically and internationally, is here. Newly produced hams are being continuously transported and sold to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Guizhou and other places. This year, over 320,000 hams are on the market, a threefold increase compared to last year. Among these, more than 100,000 hams will be sold abroad.

The variety of Jinhua ham on the market this year is greater than last year. The "Xuefang Jiang Ham" and "Bamboo Leaf Smoked Ham," which had been out of production for many years, and the long-lost "Sweet Ham" with a sweet taste, have all resumed production. More than 10,000 of these famous products have been produced this year.

    金华火腿品种增多
    国内外著名的金华火腿上市的季节到了，新制的火腿正在陆续运销杭州、上海、北京、沈阳、西安、广州、贵州等地。今年上市的火腿共有三十二万多只，比去年增产三倍。其中有十万多只火腿将运销国外。
    今年上市的金华火腿品种比去年多。停产多年的“雪舫蒋腿”和“竹叶熏腿”和失传已久的带有甜味的“甜腿”，都已恢复生产。这些名产今年共生产了一万多只。
