Urumqi Electric Report: Nearly ten million mu of wheat in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are mostly ripe, and local farmers are working hard to harvest them.

Since the beginning of spring this year, the weather in Xinjiang has been fluctuating, and the snow on the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains has melted very little, and the drought has seriously threatened the development of wheat. Leading cadres in various places mobilized farmers to fight drought. Through a series of measures such as finding water sources, digging wells, strengthening water conservancy management, and improving irrigation methods, not only was the smooth growth of wheat ensured, but also the yield of wheat was increased. It is estimated that the total output of wheat in Xinjiang this year will increase compared with last year. The more than 1.9 million mu of wheat in Kashgar Prefecture may increase production by more than 37 million jin compared with last year. Shanshan, Toksun and Turpan counties in the Turpan Basin, which have always had low yields, also have an average yield of about 200 jin per mu this year, an increase of about 60 to 70 jin compared with last year.

This year, the summer harvest preparations in various parts of Xinjiang have generally been more detailed and timely than in previous years. Most agricultural cooperatives have prepared summer harvest tools before harvesting, and have rationally allocated manpower and animal power. In order to successfully complete the summer harvest task, the responsible comrades of the party and government in various regions (autonomous prefectures) and counties personally went to the countryside to help with the harvesting. It is expected that by around the 25th, most areas of Xinjiang, except for a small portion of spring wheat in northern Xinjiang, will be harvested.

    加强水利管理　抗住干旱威胁
    天山南北一千万亩小麦丰收
    本报乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北近一千万亩小麦已大部黄熟，当地农民正紧张地进行收割。
    今年入春以来，新疆天气乍寒乍暖，天山、昆仑山的积雪融化得很少，干旱现象严重地威胁着小麦的发育。各地领导干部发动农民起来进行了抗旱斗争。通过找水源、挖泉井、加强水利管理、改进灌溉方法等一系列的措施。不但保证了小麦的顺利成长，而且提高了小麦的产量。据估计，今年新疆小麦的总产量比去年将有所增加。喀什专区的一百九十多万亩小麦，可比去年增产三千七百多万斤。过去一贯产量较低的吐鲁番盆地的鄯善、托克逊和吐鲁番三县，今年每亩平均产量也达二百斤左右，比去年约增产六、七十斤。
    今年新疆各地的夏收准备工作，一般都比往年做得细致及时。大部分农业社都在收割前将夏收用具准备停当，并合理地调配了人力和畜力。为了胜利完成夏收任务，各专区（自治州）、县的党、政负责同志都亲自下乡帮助抢收。预计到25日前后，新疆小麦除北疆一少部分春麦外，绝大部分地区即可收割完毕。
