I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and other reports of the conference. Please allow me to talk about the education issues in Shandong Province.

Recently, I inspected six middle schools, three normal schools, five primary schools, and two cultural supplementary schools in the Jinan, Qingdao, and Laiyang areas of Shandong Province. During the inspection, I held about eight座谈meetings with principals, teachers, and students. Ordinary education and normal education in Shandong Province have developed quite rapidly in the past few years, but there are many problems. Today, I will provide some suggestions on a few of the more prominent issues for reference:

I.  Bureaucracy exists to varying degrees in the work of education administrative organs at all levels.

Shandong Province has a population of 50 million and is only a nine-hour train ride from Beijing, but in the past few years, the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education have rarely visited, and the responsible comrades of the Education Department have not visited the provincial cities or special districts many times. Furthermore, education administrative organs at all levels do not have a sound inspection system, so they do not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation, nor do they have a comprehensive grasp of the materials. The Ministry of Education issues orders in Beijing, and they change quite rapidly; the Education Department acts as a bridge, and the grass-roots education bureaus and sections follow orders to assign work to schools; the schools find it difficult to implement some instructions and methods that are not very practical. During my inspection, some schools reflected: "It is difficult to understand the intentions of the Ministry of Education. Just when we manage to grasp something, it changes again. The school follows the tasks, and the students say the principal is like a conjurer." Some schools believe: "Education administrative organs must strengthen the inspection of schools, strengthen specific assistance to schools, strengthen investigation and research, and pay attention to summarizing experience. Systems should not be established blindly, nor should they be easily abolished." Some schools hope: "Responsible comrades of education administrative organs at all levels should step out of their offices and experience life in schools for a period of time." These are all voices from the schools. The tense situation that sometimes appears in ordinary education and normal education in Shandong Province is caused by a lack of communication between higher and lower levels and bureaucracy. In this regard, the Ministry of Education should first change its style of leadership. The responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education recently said that in order to strengthen local administrative management and give play to local initiative, the Ministry of Education will change its past practice of grasping everything and allow localities to adapt to local conditions, which is completely correct. However, adapting to local conditions is not simple. The Education Department must deeply understand the situation and prepare well. Some grass-roots education bureaus and sections that directly lead schools currently have very weak cadre forces and must be strengthened. In the future, education administrative organs at all levels should also establish a sound inspection system, and responsible comrades should go down to contact reality at any time.

II. There is no fixed system for the allocation of principals and teachers.

Some principals are transferred to do temporary work and do not return for a long time; some principals have relatively low cultural standards and lack experience, and they encounter difficulties in their work. The allocation of teachers is even more chaotic. Because education in Shandong developed rapidly last year, better primary school teachers were promoted to junior high schools, and better junior high school teachers were promoted to senior high schools. For example, in one middle school, half of the twenty senior high school teachers were transferred from junior high schools. In another example, one primary school transferred in and out as many as twenty teachers in one year and three months. In addition, the time of transfer is not necessarily after the end of the semester, and the teachers who are sent to replace them do not arrive in time, so the schools are very passive and the teaching work is affected. Furthermore, regarding the selection of principals and teachers, the education administrative organs do not conduct a strict enough review. Sometimes, people who cannot be placed in the province and city are stuffed into the education departments, so some principals and teachers are not competent. They themselves suffer, and the students also have many opinions. In short, there should be a system for the allocation of principals and teachers in the future. Principals should have a considerable cultural level and work experience, and the morality, talent, and intelligence of teachers should be subject to a relatively strict review. There should be a fixed method for transfers in and out, and the education administrative organs should also develop specific methods for the training of school leaders and the further education of teachers.

III. The situation of textbooks being divorced from reality is very serious.

I listened to twenty-nine lessons in Shandong this time and felt that some textbooks, such as those for literature, history, geography, and physics in middle schools and normal schools, and those for language, history, and geography in primary schools, are either too deep or too numerous. Because the textbooks are too deep, some teachers themselves do not understand them very well, and they rigidly instill them in the classroom. Students have no choice but to memorize them by rote. Because there are too many textbooks, teachers are "galloping" in the classroom, afraid that they will not be able to finish teaching, and students cannot accept them, resulting in numerous difficulties. In addition, there are also some problems with the systematicness and ideological nature of the textbooks. The Ministry of Education should combine theory with practice and quickly streamline and revise the textbooks, and it should also carefully re-compile the teaching syllabus.

IV. The burden on teachers and students is too heavy, affecting their health.

According to the materials I have, middle school and normal school teachers who are also class teachers work an average of about ten hours a day. Primary school teachers who are also class teachers work an average of eleven or twelve hours a day, and some even work thirteen or fourteen hours. Their health is not very good. A prominent example is that in one middle school, eight out of ninety teachers suffer from lung disease, eleven suffer from high blood pressure and heart failure, and twenty suffer from other chronic diseases. Another example is that in one primary school, eleven out of thirty-eight teachers are long-term sick leave. Teachers' lives are generally quite difficult. It is hoped that education departments and relevant party and government organs will provide more assistance to teachers politically, especially to primary school teachers, and provide more care in their lives. The general public should also respect them more. In the past, this has not been done enough. The staffing of primary and secondary school teachers, especially primary school teachers, seems to be too tight. Appropriately relaxing it, even if it increases the state's financial burden, is still necessary. Furthermore, regarding the burden and health of students, because there are many class hours, many subjects, and many and deep textbooks, they always feel that there is not enough time to complete written assignments and review their lessons. Therefore, they also study on Sundays without resting, and they have to burn the midnight oil when there are exams. In addition, their nutrition is poor, the environmental hygiene is not good enough, and they do not pay much attention to personal hygiene, so their health is affected. Their eyesight declines, trachoma is common, and in some schools, students with decreased vision reach 40%, and trachoma is present in more than 50%. Individual students even suffer from neurasthenia. These situations should be improved immediately. Education administrative organs at all levels must strengthen their leadership in this area, and they should actively improve from planning work to inspection and supervision work, and they should also take effective measures in schools.

V. It is imperative to strengthen political and ideological work.

The political atmosphere in schools is relatively weak, and the political and ideological level of teachers and students has not been improved as it should be. The purely technical viewpoint of teachers is rising again, and some teachers are beginning to not ask about politics. In a current affairs test given to seventy primary school teachers, the failure rate was as high as 90% on seven relatively simple questions. On the student side, some students lack a correct understanding of the relationship between democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, and individuals and collectives. Discipline is somewhat lax, and the phenomenon of being late and absent is relatively serious in some schools. To correct these phenomena, education administrative organs should first take responsibility. The addition of political courses, the training of political teachers, the strengthening of political work cadres, the compilation of political textbooks, and the strengthening of extracurricular political and ideological education are all urgent matters.

VI. Imbue labor education into the textbooks and everyday life.

In the spring of 1955, when I returned from an inspection in Shandong, I discussed the issue of labor education and the issue of employment after graduation for primary and secondary school graduates with the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education in detail, and I also emphasized this point in the report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. However, labor education was actually relaxed in 1955 and 1956. Only when a tense situation arose in the employment of primary and secondary school graduates this year did the education administrative organs start to dig a well only when they were thirsty. Labor education in schools is extremely abnormal. Students say: "Labor education comes and goes with the seasons." Labor education's seasonal nature has been criticized in the past few years, but criticism is criticism, and labor education still comes and goes with the seasons. When carrying out labor education, it is generally done in the form of social movements, and only the graduating classes do it. It seems that other grades have little to do with it. How can this be universal? How can it be in-depth? How can it play its due role? Labor education is a major issue in China's education work. The mentality that only studying is good is deeply rooted in society, and the idea of ​​despising physical labor still exists among students. To reverse this, long-term and meticulous work is needed. First of all, labor education must be regularized and concretized, imbued into the textbooks and everyday life. Schools, families, and all sectors of society must work separately. Labor education must not remain at the stage of general appeals and empty talk. It must systematically organize students to participate in after-school labor and systematically organize them to participate in productive labor during vacations, according to the students' age and physical strength. It is hoped that education administrative organs at all levels will strengthen their leadership in this area and summarize and promote experience at any time.

The above are some of the more prominent problems in education in Shandong Province. These problems may also exist in other provinces. I believe that the leading staff and teachers of education administrative organs at all levels and all schools will pay attention to these problems and be able to, as a People's Daily editorial once said: "Use full communist sunshine and rain to cultivate the seedlings and flowers of the younger generation and enable them to grow up healthily."

    山东省教育工作中的几个问题
    钱昌照的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告，请允许我谈一谈山东省的教育问题。
    最近我在山东省济南、青岛、莱阳三个地区视察了六所中学、三所师范、五所小学、两所文化补习学校。在视察期间，先后约同校长、教师、学生座谈八次。山东省普通教育、师范教育过去几年发展相当快，可是问题很多，今天把几个比较突出的问题提供参考：
    一、各级教育行政机关工作上存在着或多或少的官僚主义。
    山东省人口已达五千万，离开北京只有九小时的火车行程，但过去几年，教育部的负责同志就很少去过，教育厅的负责同志到省辖市或专区去的次数也不多，各级教育行政机关又没有健全的视导制度，因此对实际情况了解不够，掌握材料也不够全面。教育部在北京发号施令，而且变动得相当快；教育厅承上启下，基层的教育局、科遵命向学校布置工作；学校方面对有些不甚切合实际的指示和办法感到执行困难。我在视察中，有的学校反映：“教育部的意图，很难领会，好容易摸到一点边，又变了，学校跟着任务走，学生把校长说成变把戏的。”有的学校认为：“教育行政机关必须加强对学校的视导，加强对学校的具体帮助，加强对工作的调查研究，注意总结经验。制度不要盲目建立，也不要轻易废止。”有的学校希望：“各级教育行政机关的负责同志走出办公室，到学校去体验一个时期的生活。”这些都是学校方面的呼声。山东省普通教育、师范教育有时出现紧张状态，就是由于上下不大通气，官僚主义造成的。在这方面，教育部应该首先改变领导作风。教育部负责同志最近曾经说过，为了加强地方行政管理，发挥地方积极性，教育部将一变过去什么都抓的作风，要让地方能够因地制宜，乃是完全正确的。但因地制宜，并不简单，教育厅方面就得深入了解情况，做好准备工作，有些直接领导学校的基层教育局、科，目前干部力量非常薄弱，更须予以充实，今后各级教育行政机关还应该建立健全的视导制度，负责同志们也应该随时下去，接触实际。
    二、校长、教师的调配没有一定的制度。
    有些校长被调出去做临时工作，久假不归；有些校长文化水准比较低，经验比较缺乏，在工作中，发生困难。教师的调配更为忙乱，由于去年山东教育发展较快，小学较好的教师调升到初中，初中较好的教师调升到高中。例如有一所中学，二十个高中教师中，就有一半是从初中调来的。又如有一所小学在一年零三个月内调进调出的教师多至二十人。加之调出去的时间，不一定在学期终了以后，派来接替的教师，不一定及时到达，学校方面十分被动，并且影响了教学工作。再说校长、教师的人选问题，教育行政机关审查得不够严格，省市无法安置的人员，有时又向教育部门塞，因此有些校长、教师并不胜任，他们自己苦，学生意见也很多。总之，今后校长、教师的调配应该有个制度，做校长的要有相当文化水准和工作经验，教师的德、才、智要经过比较严格的审查。调进调出要有一定的办法，同时教育行政机关对学校领导干部的培养，教师的进修，也应该定出具体办法来。
    三、教材脱离实际的情况非常严重。
    我此次在山东一起听了二十九节课，觉得有些教材，例如：中学、师范的文学、历史、地理、物理等，小学的语文、历史、地理等，或是太深，或是太多。由于教材太深，有些教师自己也不甚了解，上课时生硬灌输，学生也只好死记硬背。由于教材太多，教师在课堂上，“万马奔腾”惟恐讲不完，学生更接受不了，困难重重，此外教材的系统性和思想性也有些问题。教育部应该结合实际，从速精简和修改教材，同时对教学大纲也应该慎重地重新编制。
      四、教师和学生的负担太重，影响身体健康。
    就我所掌握的材料，中学、师范教师兼班主任的平均每天工作十小时左右。小学教师兼班主任的平均每天工作十一、二小时，有多至十三、四小时的，他们的健康情况不甚好，突出的例子如有一所中学，在九十名教师中患肺病的八人，患高血压和心脏衰弱症的十一人，患其他慢性病的二十人。又如有一所小学三十八名教师中，长期病号就有十一个。教师生活一般都相当艰苦。希望今后教育部门和有关党政机关对教师，特别对小学教师政治上多多予以帮助，生活上多多予以照顾，一般社会也应该更加尊重他们，过去做得都不够。中小学教师的编制，特别是小学教师的编制，似乎太紧了，适当放宽一些，纵然增加国家财政负担，但还是必要的。再说学生的负担和健康情况，由于上课时间多，课目多，教材多而且深，完成书面作业，和复习功课总觉得时间不够，因此星期日也啃书，不休息，遇到考试还要开夜车，加之营养较差，环境卫生不够好，个人卫生也不甚注意，结果身体健康受到影响。视力减退，砂眼普遍，有些学校，视力减退的学生达到百分之四十，砂眼在百分之五十以上，个别学生甚至患神经衰弱症。这些情况应即设法改善。各级教育行政机关必须加强对这方面的领导，从计划工作到视导检查工作都应该积极改进，并且要在学校里采取有效措施。
    五、加强政治思想工作，刻不容缓。
    学校政治空气比较淡薄，教师和学生的政治思想水平未能得到应有的提高。教师方面单纯技术观点又在抬头，有些教师开始不问政治，在一次七十个小学教师时事测验中，出了七个比较简单的题目，不及格的达到百分之九十。学生方面，有些学生对民主和集中，自由和纪律，个人和集体的关系缺乏正确见解，纪律有些松弛，迟到和旷课的现象，在若干学校中比较严重的存在着。要纠正这些现象，教育行政机关首先应该负起责任来。政治课的添设，政治教师的培养，政治工作干部的充实，政治教材的编制，课外政治思想教育的加强，都是刻不容缓的事。
      六、寓劳动教育于教材之中，寓劳动教育于日常生活之中。
    一九五五年春季我从山东视察回来，就把劳动教育问题、中小学毕业生升学就业问题和教育部负责同志详细谈过，写给人大常委会的报告上也着重提出这一点，但一九五五、一九五六两年劳动教育实际上是放松了。今年中小学毕业生升学就业出现紧张状态，教育行政机关才来临渴掘井。学校的劳动教育极不正常。学生说：“劳动教育，春来秋去，”过去几年也曾批判过劳动教育的春来秋去，但批判是批判，春来秋去还是春来秋去。在进行劳动教育的时候，一般用搞社会运动的方式，而且只做毕业班的工作，其他年级好像没有多大关系。这样又如何能普遍？如何能深入？如何能发挥应有的作用？劳动教育是我国教育工作中的一个重大问题，社会上唯有读书高的心理，根深蒂固，学生中轻视体力劳动的思想，依然存在，要想扭过来，需要长期、细致的工作，首先要使劳动教育经常化，具体化，寓劳动教育于教材之中，寓劳动教育于日常生活之中，学校、家庭、社会各方面都得分头努力。劳动教育决不能停留在一般号召和空洞地讲道理的阶段上，必须根据学生年龄的大小，身体的强弱，有系统地组织他们参加课余劳动，有系统地组织他们在假期内参加生产劳动。希望各级教育行政机关加强对这方面的领导，随时总结经验，推广经验。
    以上是山东省教育中几个比较突出的问题，这些问题别省可能也有。相信各级教育行政机关以及所有学校的领导工作人员和教师定将注意这些问题，真能如有一次人民日报社论所说：“用充分的共产主义的阳光和雨露去培养年青一代的禾苗花卉，使他们健康地成长。”
