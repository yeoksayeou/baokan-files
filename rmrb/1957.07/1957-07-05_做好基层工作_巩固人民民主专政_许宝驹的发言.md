Title: Do a Good Job in Basic-Level Work and Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship: Xu Baoju's Speech

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1956 and the state budget for 1957, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan for 1957. Now I would like to express some opinions on the work of basic-level government and the work of local basic-level organizations.

I inspected Hangzhou in May of last year, Nanjing in November, and Nanchang and Fuzhou in April and May of this year (on the way back to Beijing from Fuzhou, I passed through Hangzhou and convened a symposium with the district heads of Hangzhou). The main purpose of my inspection was to understand: 1. The work of basic-level government, that is, the election of district people's representatives, the connection between the district people's representatives and the voters, the connection with the district people's committees, and whether the representatives can represent the opinions of the voters and play a role. 2. The work of local basic-level organizations, that is, the work of district people's committees, street offices, and residents' committees, and the problems that exist.

I. Regarding the work of basic-level government, it can be said that it is very good and there has been progress. Judging from the district-level elections in the autumn of last year, the average number of voters participating in the election in each district of Nanjing was 97.03% of all voters, the number of participants in Nanchang was 96.028%, and the number of participants in Fuzhou was 95.02%, all of which exceeded the proportion of participants in the general election in 1955. The representatives elected in each district are more broadly composed than in the past, and the number of women representatives and representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democrats has generally increased. The universality of electoral rights has also been further developed, and the number of people deprived of rights has been greatly reduced compared with the general election in 1953.

The basic-level election work in the autumn of last year was done relatively thoroughly and carefully. A lot of effort was put into publicity, investigation, deliberation, and consultation beforehand, and various methods were used to facilitate voters during voting. Voters were enthusiastic (there are too many examples to cite) and serious about the election. Despite the repeated deliberation and consultation beforehand, many of the preliminary lists of candidates for representatives were still sent back by the masses (for example, the preliminary list of candidates for representatives jointly nominated by the Yanzi矶 District of Nanjing was replaced by 41 people after being identified and discussed by the voters, accounting for 9% of the total number of representatives). This shows that the people attach great importance to elections and have raised their belief in being masters of their own affairs.

In the past year or so, the connection between district people's representatives and voters and the connection between district people's committees and district people's representatives have made significant progress. District people's representatives have adopted methods such as dividing up and fixing contacts with certain voters, holding various forms of voter symposiums regularly or irregularly, setting up voter reception stations in different areas, or individually visiting voters to carry out contact work. The district people's committee has also established a system for contacting representatives, with the district head regularly receiving visits from representatives and holding representative symposiums. Thanks to these systems and a series of measures, the people's democratic life has been gradually expanded, and the role of the people's representatives and the power of the people have gradually been demonstrated.

Of course, there are still shortcomings in the work, and efforts must be made to improve it. I will now only raise the following questions: (1) The demands and opinions raised by the masses to the representatives are more often related to employment, followed by welfare issues in the area (such as road repair, ditch repair, and installation of public street lights). Representatives cannot solve these two types of things. The unemployment problem is a rather large one, which I will not discuss here for the time being. As for the welfare problems in residential areas, since the District People's Committee itself does not have any funds, even if it wants to do a little bit of welfare work, which requires very little money, it must also ask the Municipal People's Committee for approval and funding, which takes a long time and may even come to nothing. This situation, repeated too often, disheartens the masses and loses their faith in the representatives, making them unwilling to raise any more opinions. This is a contradiction that needs to be resolved. (2) Some units (including agencies, schools, factories, enterprises, etc.) do not pay enough attention to basic-level government. The work of deliberating on candidates for representatives is extremely perfunctory. Some units do not even go through the process of deliberation and consultation within the unit, and hastily submit the list. They are also not enthusiastic about participating in the election voting (for example, a bank in Cangshan District, Fuzhou, put 26 election tickets in an envelope and sent someone to the polling station, saying: "Because we are busy with work, we cannot come to vote." A personnel cadre from a printing factory in Gulou District forgot to distribute the election tickets that were in his pocket. On the evening of the voting day, they went to another factory to participate in a party, and after the Municipal Election Committee learned about it, it sent a car to send the ballot box to the entrance of the factory and asked them to come out to vote. After waiting for a long time, they still voted sparsely. A drama troupe claimed that they had a performance at night and needed to sleep during the day, so they did not have time to vote. As a result, after the Provincial Organ Party Committee called twice to urge them, they reluctantly voted). Often, the areas where agencies are concentrated are also the electoral districts with the lowest proportion of participants. After all the district people's representatives are elected, the representatives elected by the residents are generally very enthusiastic and active. Representatives from agencies rarely contact voters, and some representatives have not even met with voters to this day! Therefore, voters have opinions, and residents' representatives also have opinions. I admit that the work of agencies is indeed busy, and the representatives do have their difficulties, but this problem still exists, and this contradiction must also be resolved.

II. Regarding the work of local basic-level organizations: The District People's Committee is the executive organ of the local state power organs and the basic-level organization of the state administrative organs. The street office is an agency dispatched by the District People's Committee and the most basic work organization. The residents' committee is a residents' organization of a self-governing nature, and its work is guided by the street office (and some work is guided by the public security police station), and it is even more closely linked with the daily life of the residents. Although the nature of the above three institutions is different, they are all local basic-level organizations. How to implement the state's policies, laws, decrees, and the decisions of higher levels depends to a large extent on the above three basic-level organizations. At the same time, the opinions of the masses and various problems in the daily life of residents must be collected, reflected, and dealt with in a timely manner. Their work can be said to encompass everything, both large and small, and the tasks are very arduous and complex.

I will not elaborate on the specific situation of the above three institutions in carrying out their work. In general, the work has made great achievements, and shortcomings can be improved at any time. In particular, the vast majority of basic-level cadres are able to endure hardship and work hard and actively serve the people, which is very commendable! (We must not forget that the cadres of the residents' committees are all doing voluntary work.) Now I will only raise some of the problems existing in these three institutions. From these problems, we can also see their work and the contradictions that need to be resolved.

(1) Regarding the District People's Committee: I will only raise a more important issue, which is what I have already said above, that the District People's Committee itself does not have any funds. Even if it wants to do a little bit of welfare work, it must also ask the Municipal People's Committee for approval and funding, but there are too many things to be done in the whole city. Once this kind of small thing is lined up at the Municipal People's Committee, I don't know how long it will take to line up! (For example, the toilet at Yue Fei's tomb in Hangzhou is too small and does not separate men and women. Residents have raised opinions for several years without a solution. Another example is that a ditch on Weiqian Street in Fuzhou must be dredged, requiring 200 yuan. It was submitted to the Municipal People's Representatives and handed over to the Municipal Construction Bureau for handling, but it has not been resolved for four years.) This not only, as I said above, causes the masses to lose faith in the district people's representatives, but also easily loses faith in the District People's Committee. The Municipal People's Committee manages the lower levels too much and too rigidly. A lot of work is concentrated in the city. Some cities cannot manage it, and the districts do not have the ability to manage it. This is the issue of decentralization of powers. I think it should be decentralized. How much should be decentralized? It needs to be studied.

(2) Regarding the two institutions of street offices and residents' committees, some issues are common and interrelated. Therefore, I will not try to separate them forcibly, but will raise the following issues in order:

1.  Residents have a good relationship with the street offices and residents' committees and cherish these two institutions very much. However, there are also many people in society (according to the residents' committees, these people are mostly cadres from agencies and enterprises) who do not pay enough attention to these two institutions and often treat them rudely, looking down on these two organizations and thinking that they are the most basic agencies and should listen to anyone's command. Many basic-level cadres of the residents' committees said: "We eat our own meals and do things for others, and we still get scolded and treated unfairly. It's really too unfair!" We must pay attention to the positive emotions of basic-level cadres, which are very important and very valuable, and we must not let them decline!

The reason why some people do not pay attention to the street offices and residents' committees is because they do not understand the nature and tasks of these two institutions and rashly ask them to do things for themselves. The street office is an agency dispatched by the District People's Committee, and the residents' committee is a self-governing residents' organization, each with its own different nature and certain tasks, and their status should be respected. I think we should strengthen publicity and explanation in all aspects to make the society have a correct understanding of these two institutions.

2.  The area under the jurisdiction of the street office is quite large (many areas have tens of thousands of residents), and the number of staff is small (according to the organizational regulations, there should be three to seven full-time cadres, but now there are generally four or five), and the tasks are numerous (according to my rough estimate, such as labor allocation, social relief, market management, support for the army and preferential treatment of their families, elimination of illiteracy, mediation of disputes, promotion of public bonds, grain work, repair of dilapidated houses, conscription, private schools, savings, insurance, collection of real estate tax, issuance of various certificates, all the way to the promotion of theater tickets and movie tickets, there are about 40 tasks). The work is often carried out outside, and only one person can be left in the office. Both inside and outside are too busy. Therefore, they can only grab basic-level cadres from the residents' committees to use at any time. The work is easy to be rough and messy. The cadres are too busy, they do not have time to study, and it is not easy to improve their level, and the cadres are also very uneasy. This matter needs to be resolved. I think: (1) The area under the jurisdiction of the street office can be reduced to facilitate the work (but the area under the jurisdiction of the street office is now the same as the area under the jurisdiction of the public security police station. If it is reduced, it remains to be studied whether there will be any inconvenience). (2) The number of full-time cadres must be appropriately increased, and some of the surplus personnel from various agencies can be arranged to go down.

3.  The residents' committee was originally a residents' organization of a mass self-governing nature, and its main tasks were to "handle matters related to the public welfare of the residents" and "mobilize residents to respond to the government's call and abide by the law." But now its nature has changed and become a semi-administrative agency. Many things that should be done by the business departments themselves are also handed over to the residents' committee. For example, collecting real estate tax and promoting newspapers and periodicals, the residents' committee not only mobilizes and calls on the residents, but also has to complete the task of collecting money. There are many such things, so there is no need to list them. There is already a lot of work that the residents' committee itself should do, and adding some administrative work will naturally make it feel more busy and chaotic. "Separation is beautiful for both, and combination hurts both." I think the business departments should do their own business, and it is still necessary for the residents' committee to fully restore the nature and tasks of its original organization. But this matter is also inseparable from the organization of the street office. If there are too few staff members in the street office and they are too busy with their own work, they will inevitably grab the backbone of the residents' committee, and things will still easily become chaotic. Therefore, a series of adjustments should also be made in terms of personnel and work arrangements.

4.  There are contradictions between agency cadres, cadres' families, and the residents' committee and residents. The residents' committee said that they have a "superior" mentality, do not abide by the residents' convention, and many things are not easy to handle. For example, a cadre of the Weiqian Street Residents' Committee in Fuzhou said: "When the backbone checked the household registration at the home of the director of a certain engineering office, his wife asked the backbone: 'What are you? What qualifications do you have to check our household registration?' However, when disinfecting drinking water, if they have not been to their home, they will immediately criticize them." Another example is that the deputy director of a street office in Gulou District, Fuzhou, said: "There are 'three difficulties' in residents' work, namely: agency families, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperatives. They always do not attend residents' meetings. When checking hygiene, they claim that production is busy, and even threaten: 'You are hindering production', 'If you want to make comments, please submit them to our superiors!'" The Water Conservancy Bureau of Xiannan Road built a toilet next to the road, which hindered public health, but residents' opinions were not resolved. Yang Shengong, a model military属属 of Ruziting Street in Nanchang, said: "Nanchang City established a system of responsibility for each section to rectify the city appearance, but the hygiene of staff dormitories and agency dormitories is always not good. Some even throw garbage outside. The Gaojiajing Food Company once threw all the documents into the street." There are many examples in various places, so I will not list them. Combining the opinions of the residents' committee and the residents on these matters with the opinions on not paying attention to the election mentioned above, there seems to be a ditch between agency cadres, cadres' families, and the residents' committee and residents. This needs to be filled in. The above-mentioned need to make everyone recognize the nature and tasks of the street offices and residents' committees and to enable these two institutions to receive the respect they deserve may be of some help in filling the ditch.

5.  Regarding the employment of residents' cadres (including literacy teachers). They generally hope to strive for employment through work. At present, it is not easy to solve the employment problem due to the streamlining of agencies, which inevitably affects work enthusiasm. Taking Fuzhou as an example, some basic-level cadres believe that they are "August 17th cadres" (Fuzhou was liberated on August 17, 1949), and they have not received any benefits after working until now, and many people have become negative. A solution to this problem must be found. Another issue somewhat related to this matter: There is no evaluation and reward for residents' work now. In the past, there were evaluations for five-good, hygiene work, and public security work, but there was no evaluation for the work of the director of the residents' committee; at the same time, the evaluations are not unified, and one is evaluated when one comes (such as hygiene, public security, etc.). It seems that we should consider unified arrangements and set out regulations and standards so that residents' work can also be evaluated and rewarded. This can also improve the enthusiasm for work.

There are also other issues: the issue of replenishment and training of backbones; the issue of living allowances for members of the residents' committee; the issue of how street offices and residents' committees can uniformly arrange work; the issue of too many street organizations (such as mediation committees, hygiene supervision teams, tax collection groups, literacy associations, Red Cross, etc.) and too many cadres holding multiple positions (the main cadres of the residents' committee hold four positions, and some hold nine positions); the issue of contradictions between street offices and public security police stations, etc. I will not describe them one by one here.

The above-mentioned situation of basic-level government work and the work of local basic-level work agencies, in general, has made great achievements and progress in the past few years, but there are still many areas where it is not done well enough, and there are also many contradictions. I earnestly hope that all representatives will pay attention to this aspect of things at any time (we can all contact the work of the streets at any time), and put forward opinions at any time to promote its continuous improvement. At the same time, I suggest that the central competent departments issue a notice to the local people's governments across the country: systematically collect materials and suggestions for improvement on the work of basic-level government and local basic-level work agencies, and report to the central government. The central government can analyze and study the materials and opinions from all aspects, and make necessary adjustments to the work arrangements and personnel arrangements to solve various contradictions of different nature. The organizational regulations of street offices and residents' committees were formulated at the end of 1954. After two and a half years, it should also be checked whether there are any clauses that need to be revised.

We must strengthen the leadership of the working class and consolidate the system of people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, we must do a better job in basic-level government and local basic-level organizations. I have raised some of the above issues and opinions. Whether they are correct or not, I hope that all representatives will criticize and correct them.

    做好基层工作
    巩固人民民主专政
    许宝驹的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五七年度国民经济计划的报告。现在我仅就基层政权工作和地方基层组织的工作中的若干问题发表一点意见。
    我于去年五月视察了杭州市，十一月视察了南京市，今年四、五两月视察了南昌市和福州市（由福州回北京路过杭州，又召集了杭州市各区区长座谈会）。我视察的主要目的是要了解：一、基层政权的工作情况，即区人民代表选举情况，区人民代表与选民的联系，与区人民委员会的联系情况，代表能否代表选民的意见发挥作用等问题。二、地方基层组织的工作情况，即区人民委员会、街道办事处和居民委员会的工作情况和存在着的问题。
    一、关于基层政权的工作情况，可说是很好的、有进步的。从去年秋间区级选举情形来看，南京市各区选举，选民参加投票的平均数字占全体选民的百分之九十七点零三，南昌市的参选人数占百分之九十六点零二八，福州市参选人数占百分之九十五点零二，都超过一九五五年普选时参选人数的比例。各区选出的代表，在成份上较过去更为广泛了，妇女代表、各民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表名额一般都有增加。选举权利的普遍性也有进一步的发展，被剥夺权利的人数，比一九五三年普选时降低了很多。
    去年秋间的基层选举工作是做得比较深入、仔细的。事前对于宣传、调查、酝酿、协商等工作都用了很多的力量，投票时又采用各种方式以便利选民。选民对于选举是热烈的（事例太多了，举不胜举）、认真的。代表候选人的初步名单，尽管事前经过多次酝酿、协商，但提出去被群众打回头的还是不少（例如南京市燕子矶区联合提名提出的代表候选人初步名单，经过选民的鉴别、讨论，更换了四十一名，占代表总数的百分之九）。这都说明了人民非常重视选举，提高了当家作主的信念。
    近一年多以来，区人民代表对选民的联系，区人民委员会对区人民代表的联系，都有显著的进步。区人民代表都采用了分工固定联系一定的选民、定期或不定期召开选民各种形式的座谈会、分地区设立选民接待站或个别访问选民等办法以进行联系工作。区人民委员会也建立了联系代表的制度，由区长定期接见代表来访，举行代表座谈会等。由于有了这些制度和一系列的办法，遂能逐步扩大了人民民主生活，逐渐显示出人民代表的作用和人民的力量。
    工作中当然还有缺点，还须力求改进。我现在只提出以下几个问题：（一）群众对代表所提的要求和反映的意见，比较多的是要求就业，其次就是关于本地区的福利问题（如修路、修沟、装置公用路灯之类）。这两类事代表皆无法解决。失业问题是件相当大的事，这里姑且不谈。居民区的福利问题，因区人委会本身并未掌握任何款项，即欲办一点小小福利事业，需用极少数的钱，亦须请示市人委会核准拨款，这样就旷日持久，甚至于没有下文。这种情形一多，群众便灰了心，对代表也失了信仰，不愿再提什么意见了。这是一个矛盾，需要解决。（二）有一些单位（包括机关、学校、工厂、企业等等）对基层政权不够重视。酝酿代表候选人时工作极为草率，有的并未经过本单位的酝酿、协商，匆匆便把名单提出来了。参加选举投票时亦不热心（例如福州市仓山区某银行将二十六张选举票套在一个信封，派一个人送到投票站说：因为工作忙，不能来投票。鼓楼区某印刷厂一个人事干部，将选举票放在自己口袋里忘记发给大家。当投票那一天的晚上，他们集体到别的工厂参加晚会，市选举委员会得悉后，派一部汽车将投票箱送到该厂门口，请他们出来投票，等了很久，还是很零落地走出投了票。某话剧团在投票的那一天，推说我们晚上演戏，白天要睡觉，没有空去投票，结果经省机关党委打两次电话催请，才勉强投了票）。往往机关单位集中的地区，也就是参选人数比例最少的选区。在区人民代表全数选出以后，居民所选的代表一般都很热心、积极。机关单位的代表就很少联系选民，有些代表至今还没有和选民见过面！因此，选民有意见，居民代表也有意见。我承认机关单位工作确是忙，代表确是有他的困难情形，但这个问题还始终是存在着的，这一个矛盾，也须待解决。
    二、关于地方基层组织的工作情况：区人民委员会是地方国家权力机关的执行机关，是国家行政机关的基层组织。街道办事处是区人委会的派出机关，是最基层的工作机构。居民委员会是自治性质的居民组织，在工作上受街道办事处的指导（部分工作并受公安派出所的指导），更是与居民群众日常生活紧密地连结在一起的。以上三个机构的性质虽各有不同，但都是地方基层组织。国家一切政策、法律、法令和上级的决议等等，如何贯彻执行，很大部分要依靠以上三个基层组织去做。同时，群众的意见和居民日常生活中的各种问题，均须及时搜集、反映、处理。它们的工作可以说是巨细无所不包，任务是非常繁重而复杂的。
    以上三个机构执行工作的具体情况，我现在不加陈述了。总的说来，工作是有很大成绩的，有缺点亦能随时改进。尤其是基层干部同志绝大多数都能吃苦耐劳，积极为人民服务，这是非常值得赞扬的！
  （我们不要忘记，居民委员会的干部同志们都是义务职。）现在我只提出这三个机构存在着的若干问题，从这些问题中也可以看出它们的工作和须待解决的矛盾。
      （一）关于区人民委员会的：我只提一件比较重要的问题，就是上面已经说到的，区人委会本身没有掌握任何款项，即欲办一点小小福利事业，亦须请示市人委会核准拨款，而全市待办的事业太多了，这种小事到了市人委会一排队，就不知排到何年何月！（例如杭州市岳坟的一个厕所太小，而且男女不分，居民提意见，提了几年都未解决。又如福州市卫前街有一条沟必须疏通，需款二百元，经向市人民代表提出，交市建设局办理，迄今四年之久，也未得到解决。）这不但如上面所说的使群众对区人民代表失掉信仰，同样对区人委会也容易失掉信仰。市人委会对下级管理的过多、过死，很多工作都集中在市，有的市管不了，而区又无能力去管，这是职权下放问题。我认为应该下放，下放多少？须研究。
    （二）关于街道办事处和居民委员会这两个机构，有些问题是共同的，互相关联着的，因此，我就不把它勉强分开，顺序地提出下列一些问题：
    1．居民对于街办处和居委会的关系是好的，是很爱护这两个机构的。但社会上也有不少的人（据居委会反映：这些人以机关、企业中的干部较多），对这两个机构不够重视，往往以粗暴的态度对待它们，看不起这两个组织，以为这是起码的机关，应该听任何人的指挥。很多的居委会的基层干部说：“我们吃自己的饭，替别人做事，还要挨骂受气，真太冤了！”我们必须注意，基层干部们的工作积极情绪是非常重要，非常可宝贵的，万不能使他低落下来的！
    不重视街办处和居委会的原因，是因为那些人不了解这两个机构的性质与任务，很轻率地叫它们替自己办事。街办处是区人民委员会的派出机关，居委会是自治性质的居民组织，各有其不同的性质和一定的任务，它们的地位是应当受到尊重的。我以为应从各方面加强宣传、说明，使社会上对这两个机构都有正确的认识。
    2．街办处管辖的区域相当的大（很多的地区居民有一万几千人），而工作人员少（按组织条例规定，设专职干部三人至七人，现在一般都是四人或五人），任务繁多（据我约略统计，如劳力调配、社会救济、市场管理、拥军优属、扫除文盲、调解纠纷、推销公债、粮食工作、修理危屋、兵役、私塾、储蓄、保险、征收房地产税、签发各种证明，一直到推销戏票电影票等，约有四十多种任务），经常工作都是在外面活动，办事处里只能留一个人，内外都忙不过来。因而只能随时向居委会抓基层干部使用，工作容易粗糙，容易搞乱。干部们太忙了，没有学习的时间，水准亦不易提高，干部们心情亦很不安。这事须要解决。我以为：（1）街办处所辖区域似可缩小，以便利工作（但现在街办处所辖区域，是与公安派出所的管辖区域相同的，如果缩小，有无不便，尚须研究）。（2）专职干部须适当增加，可将此次各机关编余人员安排一部分下去。
    3．居委会原是群众自治性质的居民组织，它的主要任务是“办理有关居民的公共福利事项”，“动员居民响应政府号召并遵守法律”等事项。但现在它的性质已经变了，变成半行政机关的性质了。有许多的事应该由业务部门自己去做的，也都交居委会去办。例如收房地产税、推销报刊等，居委会不仅是向居民动员号召，而且要完成收款的任务。这类的事甚多，不必列举。居委会本身应做的工作已经不少，再加上一部分行政工作，自然更觉忙乱。“离之双美，合之两伤”，我以为业务部门的事应该由业务机关自己去办，居委会仍有完全恢复它原来组织的性质、任务的必要。但这件事也是与街办处组织分不开的，街办处的工作人员太少，自己的工作忙不过来，就必然要抓居委会的基干，事情仍易搞乱，所以在人事和工作的安排上还应作一系列的调整。
    4．机关干部、干部家属与居委会、居民之间是存在着矛盾的。居委会说他们有“高人一等”的思想，不遵守居民公约，很多事不容易办通。例如福州市卫前街居委会干部说：“基干核对户口到某工程处处长家里，他的爱人问基干说：‘你们是什么，有什么资格检查我们的户口’。可是，饮水消毒时，如果没有到过他们家里，他们就立刻提出批评。”又福州市鼓楼区某街办处副主任说：“居民工作有‘三难搞’，即：机关家属、公私合营企业、合作社。居民开会，他们总是不到。检查卫生，则推说生产忙，甚至威胁：‘你们妨碍生产’，‘你们要提意见，请向我们上级去提吧！’贤南路水利局把厕所建在路旁，有碍公共卫生，居民提意见，也无结果。”南昌市孺子亭街军属模范杨圣恭说：“南昌市整顿市容成立了分段负责制，但对职工宿舍、机关宿舍卫生总搞不好，有的还把垃圾往外倒。高家井食品公司有一次把文件都丢到街上来了。”各地方的事例甚多，不列举。把居委会、居民对这些事的意见与上面所说的对不重视选举的意见结合起来看，在机关干部、干部家属与居委会、居民之间似乎存在着一条沟。这是需要填平的。我上面曾提出的要使大家认清街办处、居委会的性质与任务，使这两个机构得到应有的尊重，于填沟可能有些帮助的。
    5．关于居民干部就业问题（包括扫盲教师在内）。他们一般都希望通过工作争取就业，目前机关精简，就业问题不易解决，不免影响工作积极性。就福州市来说，有些基层干部认为自己是“八一七干部”（福州是一九四九年八月十七日解放的），干到现在还没有得到什么好处，很多人都消极下去了。这个问题总须求得一个解决的办法。与此事有些关联的另一问题：居民工作现在还没有评比奖励。过去五好、卫生工作、治安工作等都有评比，而居委会主任工作没有评比；同时评比不统一，来一个评一个，都专属于条条的（如卫生、治安等），似应考虑统一布置，定出条例和标准，使居民工作也有评比奖励。这样也可以提高工作的积极性。
    其余还有：基干的补充与培养教育问题；居委会委员的生活补贴问题；街办处、居委会如何统一布置工作问题；街办处、居委会所属的街道组织（如调解委员会、卫生督导队、税收小组、扫盲协会、红十字会等）过多与干部兼职过多问题（居委会主要干部是身兼四职，有的身兼九职）；街办处与公安派出所之间的矛盾问题等。我在这里就不一一叙述了。
    以上所述基层政权工作情况和地方基层工作机构的工作情况，总的说来，几年以来，都有很大的成绩和进步，但做得不够的地方还很多，存在着的矛盾也不少。我恳切希望各位代表随时注意这一方面的事（街道的工作我们每个人随时都可以接触到的），随时提出意见，促其不断改进。同时我建议中央主管部门可向全国地方人民政府发出通知：有系统地搜集关于基层政权工作和地方基层工作机关的材料和改进的意见，汇报中央。中央可根据各方面的材料、意见，加以分析、研究，对工作布置和人事安排作出必要的调整，以解决各种不同性质的矛盾。街办处和居委会的组织条例是一九五四年年底制定的，经过了两年半的时间，条文是否有需修改之处，也应检查一下。
    我们必须加强工人阶级的领导，必须巩固人民民主专政制度，因此也就必须把基层政权工作、地方基层组织工作做得更好。我提出了上列一些问题和意见，是否正确，还希望各位代表予以批评和指正。
