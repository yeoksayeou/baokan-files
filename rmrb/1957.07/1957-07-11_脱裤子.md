Taking Off Your Pants

Piāorán

“We hope that, through external forces, life experiences, and their own awakening, rightists can suddenly awaken and repent, and accept transformation.” In other words, they must confess their problems, "take off their pants."

“Taking off your pants” is a good thing. Exposing one's own ugliness allows one to abandon and change that ugliness.

Mí Héng, at Cáo Cāo's grand banquet, "publicly took off his old, tattered clothes, stood naked, exposing his entire body"; then "slowly put on his pants, his expression unchanged." Mí Héng was able to do this, as he himself said: "I expose the form given by my parents to show my pure and innocent body." Rightists are impure and innocent, and have lost the original form given to them by their parents, so they are very reluctant to take off their pants.

However, the people will not let them go without taking off their pants for long. Those who cherish them also clearly see that if they do not take off their pants, "they will cut themselves off from the people"; if they take off their pants, "the door to socialist transformation is open to them." Thus, they are given "external impetus" – small group meetings, large meetings, symposiums, writing articles in newspapers, criticism, and exposure to promote their "sudden awakening and repentance, and acceptance of transformation." However, whether they can "suddenly awaken" still depends on themselves.

Many facts tell us that it is not easy for those deeply mired rightists to "suddenly awaken." "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." This characteristic should be taken into account. Some rightists may admit to taking off their pants, but taking off their pants is for the sake of getting through the ordeal. Once they get through, they put their pants back on. But that doesn't matter. Taking off your pants once leaves a mark. In the old days, government offices would remove the pants of the people they beat, and the resulting scars were called "bamboo patterns." "The bamboo patterns are still there" is the judgment for the next heavy beating. Moreover, the traces of taking off your pants now (publicly confessing problems) cannot be concealed by simply putting your pants back on. Some rightists may have learned tricks from the clowns on stage. They wear many pairs of pants. If you press them, they take off one pair. If you press them again, they take off another pair. After taking off the last pair, they say, please everyone see clearly, I am indeed completely naked. In fact, there is still a layer of silk pants the same color as the skin, covering up their great ugliness. For example: Our thoughts are consistent, but there is no political connection; the effect of my remarks is very bad, but my motive is patriotic, etc. This requires us to keep our eyes open and not be deceived by their hypocrisy. There is also a kind of die-hard rightist who says he has nothing to take off, that his inside and outside are consistent. They even say: "You can't find anything anti-Party or anti-socialist even if you burn my bones to ashes." Yes, now it is popular in the countryside to use bone ash to fertilize fields, and it is impossible to find out which is socialist bone ash and which is anti-socialist bone ash. But your pants are really full of the dirty bourgeois things that are anti-Party and anti-socialist. If you don't take them off, the people will make you take them off. If you don't take them off today, you will have to take them off tomorrow.

Taking off your pants is a good thing. If you think the phrase "taking off your pants" is too crude, then changing it to what Premier Zhou said, "suddenly awaken and repent, and accept transformation," or what is said in meetings and newspapers: "thoroughly confess your problems," is the same thing.

### 脱裤子
飘然

    脱裤子
    飘然
    “我们希望，经过外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能憣然悔悟，接受改造”。换句话说，就是要他们交代问题，“脱裤子”。
    “脱裤子”是一件好事，自己揭露自己的丑恶，因而可以抛弃与改变自己的丑恶。
    祢衡在曹操的大宴会上，“当面脱下旧破衣服、裸体而立，浑身尽露”；然后又“徐徐着裤，颜色不变”。祢衡所以能这样，正如祢衡自己说的：“吾露父母之形，以显清白之体耳”。右派分子体不清白，失去了父母给他们的原来形态，所以很不愿意脱裤子。
    然而人民不让他们久不脱裤子，爱惜他们的人也看得清楚，不脱裤子“他们就将自绝于人民”；脱了裤子，“社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的”。于是给他们以“外力推动”，小组会、大会、座谈会、报上写文章，批评揭发，促进他们“憣然悔悟，接受改造”。但是，能不能“憣然”，仍在于他们自己。
    许多事实告诉我们，要那些陷溺已深的右派分子“憣然”，是不容易的，“江山易改，本性难移”。应该估计到他们这个特点。可能有的右派分子承认脱裤子了，但脱裤子是为着过关，过了关又把裤子穿起。但这不要紧，脱过一次裤子就留下一次痕迹，从前官衙门打老百姓的屁股要脱裤子的，打过的伤痕叫“板花”，“板花犹在”，是下次挨重板子的断语。何况现在脱裤子（当众交代问题）的痕迹，已不是再把裤子穿起所能掩饰。也可能有的右派分子向舞台的丑角学来了乖，他穿有很多条裤子，逼一下，脱一条，再逼，又脱一条，脱到最后，他说，请大家看清楚，我确实脱光了。其实，还有一层和肌肤一样颜色的丝织裤子，遮住他大的丑恶。比如说：我们的思想是一致的，但政治上没有联系；我的言论的效果是很坏的，但我的动机是爱国的等。这就要我们睁着眼睛，不受他们假惺惺的骗。还有一种死硬的右派分子，说他没有可脱的，裤子里和裤子外是一致的。甚至说：“把我的骨头烧成灰也找不出反党反社会主义”。是的，现在农村盛行以骨灰肥田，哪是拥护社会主义骨灰，哪是反对社会主义骨灰，是无法找出的。但是你的裤子里实实在在装满了反党反社会主义的资产阶级的肮脏东西。你不脱，人民要你脱，今天不脱明天还得脱。
    脱裤子是件好事。如果你嫌“脱裤子”的话太粗了，那末，改为如周总理说的“憣然悔悟，接受改造”，或者如会上、报上说的：“彻底交代问题”，也是一样。
