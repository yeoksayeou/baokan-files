MSG to Promote Intellectual Development

    The scientific name of MSG is sodium glutamate. Adding a little MSG to soup will create a very delicious meat flavor, which can enhance people's appetite. Glutamic acid can also promote the metabolism of the human brain and central nervous system. According to experiments, eight mentally retarded patients were given eight to ten grams of glutamic acid every day. After a period of time, seven of them showed a significant increase in brain activity. Appropriate consumption of MSG is also beneficial for the treatment of epilepsy and intellectual retardation in children.

    This extremely valuable substance is made from wheat gluten and soybeans. Many countries, such as Italy, the United States, and Japan, are now using waste products from the sugar industry to produce MSG. This can save a lot of grain.

    促进智力发展的味精
    味精的学名叫做谷氨酸的钠盐。汤里放一点味精，就会有一种非常鲜美的肉香味，可以增进人的食欲。谷氨酸也能促进人脑和中枢神经系的新陈代谢。据试验，有八个智力迟钝的病人，每天吃八到十克氨酸，过一个时期，就有七人显著地增强了脑的活动力。适当食用味精，对于治疗羊癎风和儿童智力迟钝的病症也有好处。
    这种极有价值的东西，是用小麦的面筋和大豆来做的。现在已经有很多国家如意大利、美国和日本利用制糖工业的废品来生产味精了。这样可以节约很多粮食。
