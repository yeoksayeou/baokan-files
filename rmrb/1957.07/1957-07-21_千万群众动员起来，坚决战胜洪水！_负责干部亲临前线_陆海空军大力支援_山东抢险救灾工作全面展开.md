    Leading Cadres Go to the Front Lines, Army, Navy and Air Force Provide Strong Support
    Shandong Flood Relief Work Fully Underway
    Allocate Large Quantities of Financial Resources and Materials to Help Disaster Victims Overcome Difficulties
    Jinan, July 20th (Reporter Xiao Yan) - The flood situation in Shandong Province has worsened. From July 16th to 19th, the southern region received 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall. From July 2nd to 19th, some areas in Shandong Province experienced rainfall of up to 1,000 millimeters. More than 16.4 million mu of land have been flooded throughout the province, with 557 deaths and over 2,000 injuries. Thousands of villages, encompassing approximately one million people, have been surrounded by water. It is said that the disaster in the Lunan area is the worst in the past fifty or sixty years.
    To ensure the safety of Yanzhou and protect the Beijing-Pukou Railway, the Shandong Provincial Flood Control Headquarters implemented emergency flood diversion measures in the Si River basin on the 19th. Flood relief work is also fully underway in the disaster areas. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to dispatch more than ten leading cadres, including vice governors, members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, and deputy directors, to personally lead working groups to the disaster areas and key flood control areas of the Yellow River, Wei Canal, and Jiao-Lai River to assist in flood relief and express condolences to the victims. The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong Province are actively engaged in the flood fighting struggle. Xie Linzhang, director of finance of a certain detachment stationed in Linyi, and Lei Daxia, deputy platoon leader, gloriously sacrificed themselves while heroically protecting the dikes and rescuing disaster victims. The troops stationed in the disaster areas also vacated some barracks for the temporary accommodation of disaster victims, and officers and soldiers voluntarily initiated donations to support the disaster victims. The financial and trade departments of Shandong Province have airdropped and allocated thousands of tons of financial and food materials, as well as cooked food. The Provincial People's Committee has allocated an additional 400,000 yuan in relief funds (bringing the total relief funds allocated since the 9th to 830,000 yuan). The People's Bank has decided to allocate an additional 2.7 million yuan in loans to support the disaster areas in overcoming difficulties. In addition to allocating 300,000 jin of grain from Jinan and Qingdao to be processed into cooked food and transported to Jining and other severely affected areas to promptly supply the food needs of the disaster victims, the Provincial Grain Bureau has also instructed various localities to immediately supply grain to food-deficient disaster victims in accordance with the third-quarter grain unified sales quotas. If the quotas are insufficient, they can be reported in a timely manner for additional allocation. In emergency situations, supply can be provided first and then filed for record. The Grain Bureau has also allocated 200,000 sacks to support flood control efforts in various localities. To rescue disaster victims from danger, the Provincial Department of Transportation has allocated 13 steamships, and the Provincial Transportation Electric Equipment Company and Jinan City Company have jointly provided 18,900 automobile inner tubes and 1,500 air tubes for lifesaving purposes.
    In the flood relief efforts in Shandong Province, not only has it received strong support from the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but it has also received human and material support from all over the country. Hundreds of rubber boats, as well as steamships, amphibious vehicles, lifeboats, life jackets, sacks, straw bags, and lead wire, have been transported from Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and other places.
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of the Standing Committee on the 20th to specifically examine and study the current flood control and relief work. In addition to deciding to urgently allocate various ships to rush to the disaster areas to rescue and relocate disaster victims, livestock, and grain, it also decided to mobilize and organize a working team of five to six hundred cadres from provincial-level organs and the Jinan garrison to participate in flood relief work in the disaster areas. It is necessary to especially strengthen flood control work on the Yellow River, Wei Canal, and other rivers, and prepare to cope with the arrival of extraordinary flood peaks. In addition, the Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee is responsible for formulating specific plans for production and disaster relief, and priority should be given to helping areas where water has receded to replant late autumn crops. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee will also issue instructions, calling on the people of the entire province to mobilize and launch a conservation movement to support the disaster areas in overcoming difficulties.

    千万群众动员起来，坚决战胜洪水！
    负责干部亲临前线　陆海空军大力支援
    山东抢险救灾工作全面展开
    调拨大量财粮物资帮助灾民度过困难
    本报济南20日电　记者肖彦报道：山东省水涝灾情又有发展。本月16日到19日南部地区落雨五十到一百公厘，从7月2日到19日，山东省内有些地区下雨达一千公厘。全省被淹土地已超过一千六百四十多万亩，淹死的五百五十七人，伤两千多人。数千村庄约一百万人被水包围。据说鲁南地区灾情是近五六十年所没有的。
    为了确保兗州、保卫京浦铁路安全，山东省防汛指挥部于19日在泗河流域采取了紧急分洪的措施。灾区抢险救灾工作也在全面开展中。中共山东省委和省人民委员会决定派出副省长、省委常委、副厅长以上的负责干部十余人，亲自率领工作组到灾区以及黄河、卫运河、胶莱河的防汛重点地区，协助抢险救灾，慰问灾民。中国人民解放军驻山东部队的广大官兵积极投入抢险斗争，驻临沂的某支队财务主任谢林章和副排长雷达夏在英勇护堤抢险和抢救灾民中，光荣牺牲。灾区驻军还让出部分营房给灾民暂住，官兵主动发起捐款支援灾民。山东省财贸部门空投和拨运数千吨财粮物资，还有熟食品。省人民委员会已增拨四十万元救济款（连同9日以来，共拨出救济款八十三万元），人民银行决定增拨二百七十万元贷款，支援灾区克服困难。省粮食厅除从济南、青岛两地拨出三十万斤粮食，加工制成熟食，运往济宁等重灾区及时供应灾民食需外，同时指示各地立即按照第三季度的粮食统销指标，对缺粮灾胞及时供应，如指标不足，可及时上报追加，情况紧急，可先供应后备案。粮食厅还拨出麻袋二十万条，支援各地防汛。为救济灾民脱险，省交通厅拨出汽船十三艘，省交通电工器材公司和济南市公司共支援作救生用的汽车内胎一万八千九百条，气管子一千五百支。
    山东省在抢险救灾当中，不仅得到了中国人民解放军陆海空军的大力支援，而且得到了来自全国各地人力和物力的支援。北京、天津、沈阳、上海、南京、徐州等地运来了数百只橡皮船以及汽船、水陆两用汽车、救生船、救生衣、麻袋、草包、铅丝等大批物资。
    中共山东省委于20日召开常委会议，专门检查和研究了当前的防汛和救灾工作，除了决定紧急调拨各种船只赶赴灾区抢救和转移灾民、牲畜、粮食外，并决定动员组织省直属机关和济南市驻军干部五、六百人的工作队到灾区参加抢险救灾工作，要特别加强黄河、卫运等河防汛工作，准备应付特大洪峰到来。另外责成省生产救灾委员会，拟定生产救灾具体方案，首先要帮助退水地区抢种晚秋作物。中共山东省委和省人民委员会还要发布指示，号召全省人民动员起来开展节约运动，支援灾区度过困难。（附图片）
