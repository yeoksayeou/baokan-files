Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 14th - Indian Prime Minister Nehru refuted the claim of a so-called "Communist invasion" threat in the Middle East at a press conference in Khartoum on the evening of the 13th, before returning here. He said that some countries are using this "threat," but "I have not seen any signs of a Communist invasion."

Nehru said that both Britain and Egypt hope to restore their relations; Britain hopes to restore this relationship immediately.

Regarding the issue of permitting Israeli ships to use the Suez Canal, Nehru said that the canal is an international waterway. There are differences in interpreting the 1888 Convention. However, Egypt has expressed its readiness to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice.

Speaking about the African conference proposed by Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah, he said it was a "good idea." He said that mutual understanding is an important matter.

When asked whether India would accept American aid "to fight communism," Nehru replied that India would not accept such aid because they rely on themselves and their own methods to solve problems. However, India would accept economic aid as before to develop its country.

Regarding the Eisenhower Doctrine, Nehru said that he did not approve of this kind of aid bound by military considerations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 14th - Indian Prime Minister Nehru left Cairo this morning to return to India.

After returning to Cairo from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on the evening of the 13th, Prime Minister Nehru attended a banquet held in his honor by President Nasser. Subsequently, they continued their talks until late at night.

No communique was issued after the talks.
