At the Socialist Academy Anti-Rightist Struggle Conference
Gu Zhizhong Begins to Confess Facts of Conspiracy Activities

    This newspaper reports: On July 6th, the Socialist Academy held a conference to criticize Gu Zhizhong's reactionary words and deeds. Under the questioning and accusations of the masses, Gu Zhizhong began to stammeringly confess some of his activities with right-wing elements Wang Zaoshi, Lu Yi, and others to conspire to organize a reactionary political party.
    Gu Zhizhong admitted: In March of this year, when Wang Zaoshi came to Beijing to participate in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he met with Wang Zaoshi five times, and the main topic of discussion was the restoration of the "National Salvation Association." Gu Zhizhong said that their active attempt to restore the "National Salvation Association" was based on Wang Zaoshi's assessment that the world situation was not yet optimistic, a third world war was about to occur, and imperialism might directly attack China. They wanted to "seize the opportunity" when this situation arose. The masses questioned him: What was the purpose of seizing the opportunity? Gu Zhizhong said: It was to oppose socialism and oppose the leadership of the Party. Gu Zhizhong said: The steps of their conspiracy activities were: he and Wang Zaoshi would first discuss with some people in Beijing and Shanghai separately to restore the "National Salvation Association." Gu Zhizhong looked for Pan Dakui, Zhang Dingfu, and Zhang Naiqi in Beijing. Wang Zaoshi looked for Lu Yi, Peng Wenyin, Sun Dayu, Chen Renbing, and Liu Liangmo in Shanghai. They not only prepared to find the old members of the original National Salvation Association, but also prepared to develop new members. During his studies at the Socialist Academy, Gu Zhizhong actively recruited students to join the Jiusan Society. Gu Zhizhong believed that absorbing these people to participate in the Jiusan Society today would allow them to become members of the "National Salvation Association" in the future. Their second step was to take advantage of the Party's rectification movement to set fires everywhere. Wang Zaoshi and others set fires in Shanghai, and he set fires in Beijing. Wang Zaoshi attacked the Party on legal issues, and he attacked the Party on constitutional issues in Beijing, cooperating with each other and responding to each other. He said: Their method of opposing socialism and opposing the Party's leadership in the rectification movement was to speak everywhere, write articles in newspapers, and undermine the Party. Gu Zhizhong admitted: Their attempt to restore the "National Salvation Association" to carry out anti-socialism and oppose socialism was organized, had a division of labor, and had activities.
    The masses questioned Gu Zhizhong about what exactly they intended to do when imperialism attacked China, what they wanted to achieve by setting fires everywhere in the rectification movement, and who else was involved in their conspiracy activities. Gu Zhizhong evaded and did not explain clearly.
    At yesterday's conference, the masses also revealed that Gu Zhizhong, when the grassroots organization of the Jiusan Society of the Higher Education Publishing House was holding a meeting, had highly praised the absurd remarks of the Shanghai right-wing element Sun Dayu, who falsely accused more than sixty democratic figures and Communist Party members of being counter-revolutionaries, saying that Sun Dayu was very brave, and this shot was fired well, to see if this shot would make a sound, in an attempt to confuse the masses. Gu Zhizhong also incited some backward elements to attack the Party's leadership at the Higher Education Publishing House, asking them to bombard with various calibers of artillery, collect materials, and go outside to accuse.
    The struggle of the Socialist Academy against the right-wing element Gu Zhizhong will continue, and the masses unanimously expressed that they will never give up until complete victory.

    在社会主义学院反右派斗争大会上
    顾执中开始交代阴谋活动事实
    本报讯　7月6日，社会主义学院举行大会，批判顾执中的反动言行。在大家的质问和指责下，顾执中开始吞吞吐吐地交代了一些他与右派分子王造时、陆诒等阴谋组织反动政党的活动。
    顾执中承认：今年3月间，王造时来北京参加全国政协会议时，他和王造时见面谈过五次，谈的主要都是恢复“救国会”的问题。顾执中说，他们积极企图恢复“救国会”的目的，是根据王造时的估计，世界形势还未可乐观，第三次世界大战还要发生，帝国主义还可能直接进攻中国，他们要在这种形势来到的时候，“乘机而起”。大家追问他：乘机而起的目的是什么？顾执中说：是要反对社会主义、反对党的领导。顾执中说：他们阴谋活动的步骤是：他和王造时先分别跟北京、上海的一部分人商量，把“救国会”恢复起来。顾执中在北京找潘大逵、张定甫、章乃器。王造时在上海找陆诒、彭文应、孙大雨、陈仁炳、刘良模，他们不但准备要找原来救国会的老人，还准备发展新人。顾执中在社会主义学院学习期间，积极拉拢学员参加九三学社。顾执中认为，吸收这些人今天是参加九三学社，将来就可以成为“救国会”的会员。他们的第二个步骤，就是要趁党整风的机会，到处放火。王造时等在上海放火，他在北京放火，王造时就法律问题向党进攻，他在北京也就宪法问题向党进攻，彼此配合，互相呼应。他说：他们在整风中反社会主义、反对党的领导的方法，就是要到处讲话，在报纸上写文章，破坏党。顾执中承认：他们企图恢复“救国会”进行反社会主义，反对社会主义是有组织、有分工、有活动的。
    群众质问顾执中，他们究竟企图在帝国主义进攻中国时想干些甚么，他们在整风运动中到处放火想达到什么目的，在他们的阴谋活动里面还有那一些人的时候，顾执中躲躲闪闪，没有交代清楚。
    在昨天的大会上，群众还揭发了顾执中在高等教育出版社的九三学社的基层组织开会时，曾经十分赞扬上海的右派分子孙大雨诬蔑六十几位民主人士和共产党员为反革命分子的荒谬言论，说是孙大雨很勇敢，这一炮开得很好，要看这一炮响不响，企图迷惑群众的视听。顾执中在高等教育出版社还煽动一些落后分子向党的领导进攻，要他们用各种口径的炮轰，要他们收集材料，到外面去控告。
    社会主义学院对右派分子顾执中的斗争，还将继续进行，群众一致表示，不获全胜，决不罢休。
