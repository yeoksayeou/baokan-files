Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. The National Supervisory Organs' Work Conference on Handling Citizens' Complaints, held from the 15th to the 20th, decided that handling citizens' complaints should be one of the basic tasks of supervisory organs at all levels, and is an important aspect of supervisory organs relying on the masses to carry out supervisory work.

The conference was convened by the Ministry of Supervision. Materials at the conference showed that since Chairman Mao made a speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the Chinese Communist Party launched the rectification movement, the number of complaints and appeals received by supervisory organs at all levels has generally increased by one to three times compared with the same period last year. In addition to some of these cases being appeals by the masses regarding related cases, many are revelations and criticisms made by the people who are concerned about national construction, regarding certain shortcomings and errors in the work of state organs. The meeting believes that timely and correct handling of these issues by the state supervisory organs has an important role in correctly resolving contradictions among the people.

The meeting affirmed that the work of handling citizens' complaints by state supervisory organs at all levels has made great achievements in recent years. According to incomplete statistics, national supervisory organs received a total of more than 320,000 letters and received more than 87,000 visitors in 1955 and 1956. Among them, more than 190,000 cases of citizens' complaints fell within the scope of the supervisory organs' authority. Supervisory organs at all levels generally accounted for or dealt with these cases. According to incomplete statistics in 1956, state supervisory organs at all levels directly investigated and handled more than 30,000 cases of citizens' complaints, accounting for 34% of the total number of cases accepted in 1956. For example, Ma Jichuan, director of the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Culture, cursed and beat service personnel while eating at a restaurant in Lanzhou on September 6, 1956, arousing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The Gansu Provincial Department of Supervision investigated the case and, after reporting to the State Council for review, decided to give Ma Jichuan the punishment of dismissal. As another example, the National Bureau of Supervision for the Food Industry, based on citizens' complaints, inspected the state-owned Tianjin Winery and found that there were serious bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles in the leadership of the factory, such as three incidents of "diao pai" accidents, resulting in the loss of more than 660,000 jin of liquor. Through inspection, the problem of "diao pai" in production was solved, enabling the factory to complete its production plan ahead of schedule and the product quality to meet national standards. Supervision and inspection by supervisory organs at all levels on the handling of people's letters and visits by state administrative organs, enterprises, and institutions have also been strengthened.

The meeting pointed out that there are still shortcomings and errors such as bureaucracy and subjectivism in the work of handling citizens' complaints in the supervisory organs. Some supervisory organs delay and procrastinate in handling cases. Some supervisory organs simply forward cases without conducting direct investigations. Some supervisory organs do not investigate cases thoroughly and cannot solve problems. Some supervisory organs have a small number of cadres who manage citizens' complaints work with low quality, etc. The meeting decided that in the future, the supervision departments and bureaus of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality, and each national supervision bureau, must have a department or bureau director responsible for managing this work, and other supervisory organs should also have a leader in charge of this work. Leaders of supervisory organs at all levels should regularly receive the masses in person and handle and inspect cases, and include the leadership of handling citizens' complaints as an important part of leadership activities; the institutions and cadres responsible for handling this work should also be strengthened. At the same time, it is also necessary to implement a combination of specialized institutions, dedicated personnel, and everyone's participation to strengthen this work.

    监察工作体现了人民民主制度的优越性
    处理公民控诉的工作成绩巨大
    全国监察机关两年内收到人民来信三十二万多件，接见人民来访
    八万七千多人次；其中受理案件十九万多件，一般都作了交代和处理
    新华社23日讯　15日到20日举行的全国监察机关处理公民控诉工作会议，决定把处理公民的控诉作为各级监察机关的基本任务之一，是监察机关依靠群众进行监察工作的一个重要的方面。
    这次会议是由监察部召开的。会议上的材料说明，自从毛主席作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演以及中国共产党开展整风运动以来，各级监察机关接到的公民控告和申诉案件一般都较去年同期增加了一倍到三倍。这些案件中除了有一部分是群众对有关的案件的申诉外，有许多是人民群众由于关心国家建设，而对国家机关工作中的某些缺点、错误所作的揭发与批评。会议认为，国家监察机关及时、正确地处理这些问题，对正确解决人民内部矛盾问题有着重要的作用。
    会议肯定几年来各级国家监察机关处理公民控诉的工作有很大的成绩。据不完全统计，全国监察机关1955年和1956年两年内共收到来信三十二万多件，接见来访群众八万七千多人次。其中属于监察机关职权范围的公民控诉案件共十九万多件。各级监察机关对这些案件一般都作了交代或处理，据1956年的不完全统计，各级国家监察机关直接检查处理的公民控诉案件就有三万多件，占1956年受理案件总数的34％。例如甘肃省文化局局长马济川，1956年9月6日在兰州一家饭店吃饭的时候，谩骂和殴打服务人员，引起群众的极大不满。甘肃省监察厅对这一案件进行了检查，经报国务院审查，决定给予马济川以撤职处分。又如食品工业国家监察局根据公民控告，对国营天津酿酒厂进行了检查，发现该厂领导上存在着严重的官僚主义和主观主义的作风，如曾经发生三次掉排事故，损失白酒六十六万余斤。通过检查，解决了生产掉排问题，使这个厂提前完成了生产计划，产品质量达到了国家标准。各级监察机关对国家行政机关、企业、事业单位处理人民来信、来访工作的监督和检查也已经加强。
    会议指出，目前监察机关对处理公民控诉的工作中还存在官僚主义、主观主义等缺点和错误。有的监察机关处理案件拖延、迟缓。有的监察机关处理案件抄抄转转，很少直接检查。有的监察机关查案不深不透，不能解决问题。有的监察机关管理公民控诉工作的干部量少质弱等。会议决定今后各省、自治区、直辖市监察厅、局和各国家监察局必须有一个厅、局长负责管理这项工作，其他监察机关也应该有一个领导人主管这项工作。各级监察机关的领导人应该经常亲自接见群众和处理、检查案件，并把对于处理公民控诉工作的领导列为领导活动的重要内容；对处理这一项工作的机构和干部也要加强。同时还要实行专门机构、专人负责与大家动手相结合的办法来加强这一项工作。
