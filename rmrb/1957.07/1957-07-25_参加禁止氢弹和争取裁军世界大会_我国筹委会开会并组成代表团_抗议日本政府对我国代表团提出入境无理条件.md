Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: The Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held a meeting today to select the members of the Chinese delegation to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament. The meeting also adopted a statement severely protesting the unreasonable entry conditions imposed by the Japanese government on the Chinese delegation (statement attached).

The members of the Chinese delegation to the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament selected at the meeting are: Head of the delegation, Cai Tingkai; Deputy Head, Zhao Puchu; Secretary-General, Zheng Senyu; Members, Chen Yongwen, Zhu Hongyuan, Shi Ruzhang; in addition, there will be three staff members and two Xinhua News Agency reporters accompanying the delegation.

The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament will be held in Tokyo, Japan, starting on August 6 this year. This conference was initiated by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and has received broad support from the Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: Statement of the Chinese Preparatory Committee Regarding the Unreasonable Entry Conditions Imposed on the Chinese Delegation by the Japanese Government

The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, initiated by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and widely supported by peace-loving people around the world, will be held in Tokyo, Japan, starting on August 6, 1957. The Chinese people warmly support the holding of this conference. The Chinese people have already sent their representatives to participate in the international preparatory organization and established a Chinese Preparatory Committee on July 2nd, deciding to send a delegation to participate in this conference.

However, it is extremely regrettable that the Chinese Preparatory Committee recently received from the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs the Japanese government's application form for entry visas for the Chinese delegation, requiring Chinese representatives to fill it out and send it back. The Japanese government has put forward unreasonable conditions on the application form: (1) Must notify the Japanese Minister of Justice in writing of any changes of address at any time; (2) When traveling in Japan, the itinerary must be notified to the Japanese Minister of Justice forty-eight hours in advance; (3) Must not engage in any activities other than the purpose of entry. The application form also stipulates that representatives attending the conference must swear to guarantee compliance with the above conditions, otherwise they will be deported.

The Japanese people have suffered severely from atomic bombs. After the war, the Japanese people have made positive efforts to defend peace and oppose war, winning the warm sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and people. As is well known, the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan to attend this conference represents the 600 million peace-loving Chinese people, working together with the Japanese people and the people of all countries to ban nuclear weapons and strive for disarmament, and will express condolences to the Japanese people who have suffered from atomic weapons. This purpose is very clear. At the same time, there is no doubt that the itinerary of the Chinese delegation after arriving in Japan will be arranged by the preparatory organization of the conference. However, the Japanese government has put forward extremely unreasonable conditions and requires representatives to swear an oath. This is one of a series of extremely unfriendly and hostile actions taken by the Japanese government towards our country recently, with the aim of hindering the Chinese delegation from participating in the conference. This practice by the Japanese government violates the lofty aspirations of the Japanese people and the people of all countries to oppose nuclear weapons. The Chinese delegation absolutely cannot fill out this application form with unreasonable and insulting conditions.

We warmly hope to meet with representatives of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in Tokyo to exchange views on the issue of banning nuclear weapons, which is related to world peace and human happiness. If the Chinese delegation's schedule is affected or even unable to attend the conference due to the obstruction of the Japanese government, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for this.

    参加禁止氢弹和争取裁军世界大会
    我国筹委会开会并组成代表团
    抗议日本政府对我国代表团提出入境无理条件
    据新华社24日讯　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国筹备委员会今天举行会议，推选出席第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国代表团的组成人员。会议还通过一项声明，对日本政府向中国代表团提出的十分无理的入境条件表示严重抗议（声明附后）。
    会议推选的出席第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国代表团组成人员是：团长蔡廷锴，副团长赵朴初，秘书长郑森禹，团员有陈用文、朱洪元、施如璋，另外还有工作人员三人，随行新华社记者二人。
    第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会将在今年8月6日起在日本的东京举行。这次大会是由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会倡议，并且得到中国人民和世界爱好和平人民广泛的支持。

    新华社24日讯　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国筹备委员会关于日本政府向中国代表团提出入境无理条件的声明
    由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会倡议，并且得到世界爱好和平的人民广泛支持的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，将于1957年8月6日起在日本东京举行，中国人民热烈支持这次大会的召开。中国人民已经派出了自己的代表参加国际筹备机构，并且于7月2日成立了中国筹备委员会，决定派遣代表团参加这次大会。
    但是非常遗憾，中国筹备委员会最近收到了日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会寄来日本政府所制定的关于中国代表团入境签证的申请书，要中国代表先填写寄去。日本政府在申请书上提出了无理的条件：（一）须随时用书面把住址的改变情况通知日本法务大臣；（二）在日本旅行的时候，需在四十八小时前将行程通知日本法务大臣；
  （三）不作入境目的以外的任何其他活动。申请书上还规定要出席大会的代表宣誓保证遵守上述条件，否则将被驱逐出境。
    日本人民曾经遭受过原子弹的严重灾害，战后日本人民为保卫和平、反对战争作了积极的努力，获得了一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈的同情和支持。如所周知，中国代表团到日本参加这个大会，是代表着六亿热爱和平的中国人民，同日本人民和世界各国人民一起，为禁止原子核武器和争取裁军而共同努力，并且，将向日本遭受原子武器灾害的人民表示慰问。这个目的是十分明白的。同时，中国代表团到达日本以后的日程，当由大会的筹备机构安排，也是没有疑问的。然而日本政府却提出了十分无理的条件，并且要代表宣誓。这是日本政府近来对我国极不友好的带敌视性的一系列行为之一，其目的是想阻挠中国代表团参加大会。日本政府这种作法是违反日本人民和各国人民反对原子核武器的崇高意旨的。中国代表团绝不能填写这种无理的和带有侮辱性条件的申请书。
    我们热烈地希望同日本人民和世界各国人民的代表在东京相聚一堂，就关系世界和平和人类幸福的禁止原子核武器问题交换意见。如果由于日本政府的阻挠，中国代表团的行期受到影响，甚至无法出席大会，这应该由日本政府负完全的责任。　1957年7月24日
