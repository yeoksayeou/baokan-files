Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 30th. The International Students' Club of the World Youth Festival opened on the evening of the 29th at the State Moscow University on Lenin Hills.

Several thousand students from various countries spent a pleasant evening together for the first time here. Mexican students wearing red hats, black African students, philosophy students with long beards, and students from other famous universities gathered together. Some were engaged in lively discussions in the coffee room, while others were making new acquaintances. Black Africans and Finnish girls danced to the rhythm of a fast waltz. The sounds of voices and laughter filled every corner of the club.

In the hall, the Moscow University Student Choir sang old Russian student songs for their friends, and Egyptian girls performed the beautiful dance "On the Banks of the Nile." Until late at night, the club was filled with music, and groups of students were reluctant to leave.

The International Students' Club is an innovation of this Youth Festival. It is specifically designed as a venue for students participating in the festival to hold gatherings, cultural activities, and debates. Students will hold twenty meetings here to discuss various issues such as philosophy, atomic energy, and literature.

    倾心畅谈　尽情歌舞
    国际学生俱乐部开幕
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　世界青年联欢节的国际学生俱乐部29日晚上，在列宁山上的国立莫斯科大学开幕。
    来自各国的几千名学生第一次在这里共同度过了一个愉快的夜晚。带着红帽子的墨西哥学生、非洲的黑人学生、留着长胡子的哲学系大学生和其他各国著名大学的学生们欢聚在一起，有的在咖啡间高谈阔论，有的在结识新交。非洲的黑人和芬兰姑娘按着急促的圆舞曲跳着舞。人语喧哗声和欢笑声充塞到俱乐部的每一个角落。
    在大厅里，莫斯科大学的学生合唱团在为朋友们演唱古老的俄国学生歌曲，埃及姑娘在跳优美的舞蹈“在尼罗河岸上”。直到夜阑人静，俱乐部里仍然弦歌不绝，成群的学生依依不肯离去。
    国际学生俱乐部是本届青年联欢节的创举。它是专门作为参加联欢节的学生举行聚会、文艺活动和辩论的场所。学生们要在这里举行二十次会见，讨论哲学、原子能、文学等各种问题。
