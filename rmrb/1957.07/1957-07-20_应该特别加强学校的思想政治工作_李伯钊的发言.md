    I agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report and other reports.
    In Premier Zhou Enlai's report, it was mentioned that judging from the situation revealed by the recent rectification movement, we should particularly strengthen ideological and political work in schools. I realize the profound significance of this issue, so I would like to talk about it for the benefit of all the representatives.
    On April 12th this year, I departed from Beijing to inspect the Sichuan electoral district. In Chengdu and Chongqing, I inspected six higher education institutions, including Sichuan Medical College, Sichuan University, Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, Southwest Conservatory of Music, and Southwest Academy of Fine Arts. Some institutions I visited for a day, some for two, and some for only half a day. Generally speaking, the work of Sichuan's higher education institutions, under the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education and the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee, has been remarkable, and the development has been rapid. For example, the school buildings of various institutions are beautiful and practical, the environment is beautiful, and the scenery is pleasant. No wonder Soviet friends praised, "The school buildings of Sichuan's higher education institutions are like a large garden." The teaching equipment of various institutions has a certain scale, and the teaching staff is relatively strong, with many well-known scientists and artists teaching at the schools. Since liberation, they have cultivated many talents for the motherland. If you ask whether there are any shortcomings in the work of these institutions? There are some. The weakness of ideological and political work in schools is a relatively common and fundamental problem. When I participated in various symposiums at several schools, many teachers and student representatives said in unison: "Our school's ideological and political work is weak, and there are many ideological problems among teachers and students." The following are some more typical examples of the ideological situation of students and teachers before the rectification movement, as reflected by them: Graduates of normal colleges are unwilling to become middle school teachers. According to Zhang Furong, a professor in the Department of Education at Southwest Normal College, and Wang Xiuquan, the acting director of the Department of Mathematics, students at the school generally do not want to become middle school teachers, but are enthusiastic about scientific research. Therefore, in their studies, they only emphasize how important professional learning is and are unwilling to study pedagogy and teaching methods. Huang Shu, an assistant in the Department of Mathematics at Sichuan University, said: The Department of Mathematics has more than eighty undergraduate graduates this year, and more than 80% of them are willing to work as teaching assistants in higher education institutions, to march towards science, declaring that they are unwilling to work in factories and mines. They believe that working in factories and mines leads to slow advancement and promotion. Only one or two people are willing to become people's teachers in middle schools after graduation. Some college students are not at ease with their chosen major and lack confidence in establishing professional ideals. Student representatives from the Department of History at Sichuan University said: 30% of the students are not at ease with studying history, believing that studying history is a dead end and has no future. It is most difficult for lower-grade students to establish professional ideals. It is common in schools that students do not respect teachers and teaching assistants, and students look down on administrative staff, disrespect the labor of administrative staff, and belittle them. Among teachers, the phenomenon of negating everything is not isolated. When summarizing the teaching reform work of the past few years, some people in various schools, after examining the shortcomings of dogmatism in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, completely negated the achievements of learning from the Soviet Union's experience. They have an unclear understanding of some major political issues in the country. For example, there are errors in the understanding of democracy and freedom among some teachers. According to Jiang Xiushang, the acting director of Chongqing University, a few teachers believe that the combination of democracy and centralism will hinder "letting go." They think that once personal opinions are centralized, they disappear. A few teachers also believe that strengthening political and ideological education is contradictory to "letting go." They say: Since we want to let go, everyone should be completely free and not be restricted. Many students in various schools lack a correct understanding of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and some students mistakenly use this policy to oppose collective activities. The situation where teachers in some schools only teach books and do not teach people is relatively serious. How can we talk about teaching students in accordance with their aptitude? Many teachers and students mostly only meet in the classroom and rarely interact after class.
    From the above examples, it can be seen that some teachers and students in these schools have complex ideological situations. There are contradictions between individual interests and collective interests among students. There are contradictions between students and teachers and administrative staff. Senior students are more ideologically complex than junior students, and teachers are more ideologically complex than students. Regarding the explanation of democracy; democratic centralism; and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," everyone has their own understanding, everyone has their own主張, right and wrong are unclear, and the understanding is not clear. The study of the country's basic system and current affairs policies seems insufficient. There are misunderstandings about political and ideological work, and so on. Students are, after all, educated, while teachers are the teachers of students, the people who lead the way. Young people's political interests and living habits often take teachers as examples, and should be paid more attention to. Further investigation reveals that there are two major gaps in the political and ideological work of schools: first, party members and League members can generally conduct some education for party members and League members through party and League organizations. The general student masses are the majority of colleges and universities. Their ideological education has become a major gap. Second, over-age League members. At present, major colleges and universities have not resolved the work of over-age League members among young teachers. They are no longer ordinary young people, so it is no longer appropriate to carry out work on them using the methods of ideological education for young people. However, they are not party members either. In fact, the Party and the League do not care much about them. Over-age League members account for a significant number among lecturers and assistants in various higher education institutions. How to care for and help them progress, and fill this gap? All need to be studied and resolved. It can be seen from this that the ideological and political education work of schools must be strengthened, and this is still the situation under normal circumstances.
    In Beijing, during the upsurge of the Zhang-Luo alliance frantically attacking the Party, releasing large amounts of poison, and letting loose wildly, the reflection in the schools was also a fierce struggle, which was thousands of times more complex than the usual school situation. Taking the example of the Central Academy of Drama's big blooming and big contending, one cannot help but be surprised. It can be said that whatever exists in society exists in the academy. Of course, the majority of teachers and students in the academy are still enthusiastic about helping the Party with rectification. Among them, there were also those who were impassioned, said the wrong things, and went too far. There is no need to mention this. On the same day that the People's Daily published Ge Peiqi's article, a big-character poster named "Katyusha" was reproduced in the academy, and the most reactionary words were printed in large red letters the size of bowls, for fear that readers would skip over them. Immediately, there appeared supporters, opponents, and those who neither supported nor opposed, and the struggle immediately unfolded. The fire was lit. As society saw threatening letters sent to Lu Yuwen, in the academy, under the instigation of a teacher, a student issued an ultimatum to the academy's leadership.
    When the Guangming Daily published Chu Anping's reactionary remarks about "the Party's world," Chen Tingsha, a teaching assistant and Communist Youth League member in the Department of Dramatic Theory, wrote "I Am the Party" to spread poison for Chu Anping. Immediately afterward, he wrote anti-poems on the door of the Party's general branch. He unconditionally became an echo of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.
    As there were right-wing professors in society frantically attacking the Party, in the academy, Sun Jiaxiu, a member of the All-China Women's Federation and a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, cried out in a piece entitled "Disillusioned and Hoping" after a denunciation meeting held by the Democratic League branch. The original text of this article is excerpted as follows:
    "...Thank Marxism-Leninism for teaching me to look at problems dialectically. I understand that it is the Party's truth that teaches me to see the shortcomings of Party members...But your Three Great Doctrines, and all other behaviors, are depriving and destroying people's ideals, suffocating people's ambition, blocking the vitality of young people, and deceiving students' beliefs. Is this not a crime? Should this not be condemned by all?................
    I cannot but use Shakespeare's words to show you the mirror.
    Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, —
    As, to behold desert a beggar born,
    And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,
    And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
    And gilded honour shamefully misplac’d,
    And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
    And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
    And strength by limping sway disabled,
    And art made tongue-tied by authority,
    And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
    And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,
    And captive good attending captain ill:
    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
    The dark world of three hundred years ago was like this. Do we have to endure suffering again? We have long surpassed Shakespeare. We live in an era that people before Shakespeare yearned for. It is not that I want to destroy socialism and drag people back to three hundred years ago, but you are dragging us back."
    Professor Sun Jiaxiu is attacking the Party by wearing the banner of Marxism-Leninism, draped in Shakespeare's gauze, and disguised as an upright professor. The Central Academy of Drama was described by her as a hell on earth, a place of darkness. The most vicious thing is that she used Shakespeare's tragic poems, which cursed the dark and autocratic dynasty three hundred years ago, to attack the Party, attack the new social system, and shamelessly said: "It is not that I want to destroy socialism and drag people back to three hundred years ago, but you are dragging us back." Dear professor, we usually respect her, admire her, because she is knowledgeable and has some research on Shakespeare's poems, hoping that she will use them to teach young people and guide students to accept the precious treasures of human culture. We Marxists believe that Shakespeare, the pinnacle of world art, should be treated fairly. Do not, like the decadent European and American bourgeoisie, pull him back to the distant past, or excessively modernize the characters in Shakespeare's works, dressing "Hamlet" in a tuxedo, but truly promote the immortal original things in his works. Shakespeare's tragedy is a product of a specific historical era. In Shakespeare's time, some people and some social forces were the pioneers of the era; there were also some social forces that were the ancestors of our enemies. In the poet's eyes, who is the enemy and who is the friend is clear. Why should his works be ruined, confusing right and wrong, and using his poems to attack the new society. Is the professor trying to drag the youth to the distant past, or are we forcibly dragging the professor back three hundred years? Which side is right, isn't it very clear? The professor is wrong. We welcome the professor to turn back. Doesn't the professor still have the phrase "hoping"?
    Finally, a member of the Democratic League came out from the academy, using the Katyusha newspaper to organize a free forum, publicly clamoring: demanding that the Communist Party withdraw from the academy, and so on. So that's it. This is exactly the same as the program of the Zhang-Luo alliance rightists, no different. We cannot but pay attention to the direction of certain members of the Democratic League. How exactly are they serving the right-wing group?
    The Academy of Drama is a young institution of higher learning, from scratch. Before liberation, where could you find an academy offering majors in acting, directing, stage art, and dramatic literature? Recalling the establishment of the academy to date, under the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Culture, the achievements are still the main thing. There are many errors and shortcomings, and they are relatively serious, but it is by no means a complete mess. We are improving our work with full confidence.
    The academy is launching a large-scale counterattack against the rightists. The teachers and students of the whole academy are rising up to draw a line ideologically with the rightists. We will not withdraw our troops until we win. In the struggle, comrades who have made mistakes, and some comrades who have lost their way, are conducting self-criticism.
    Indeed, in this short period of rectification, we have seen more things than in the usual few years. Without rectification, how would we know the depth and level of our work? We have seen many things clearly, and we have seen many people clearly. We have learned a truth: The academy is ultimately a microcosm of society. The class struggle in society, in which rightists attack the Party, is reflected in schools in such a dramatic way. From this, we understand that not only does bourgeois ideology, which is in contradiction with socialism, exist in schools, but there are also conspiracies and activities of rightists. We can only blame ourselves for being too numb in the past. As the class struggle in society is fierce, the class struggle in the academy is also not simple. Another serious lesson: Running an academy cannot be divorced from politics.
    In short, no matter from the major issues revealed under normal circumstances or under the circumstances of big blooming and big contending; it shows that ideological and political work in schools should be particularly strengthened.
    Premier Zhou Enlai's suggestion that schools should strengthen ideological and political work is very timely. The purpose of strengthening ideological and political work in schools is to constantly criticize bourgeois idealism and establish a proletarian dialectical materialist worldview among teachers and students through teaching, academic discussions, scientific research, and ideological education of the Party and League. Ideological and political work is a construction task of a hundred-year plan for schools. Chairman Mao said: All departments should be responsible for ideological and political work. The Communist Party should take charge, the Communist Youth League should take charge, the government's competent departments should take charge, and the principals and teachers of schools should take even more charge. It is hoped that the State Council and the Second Office will instruct the Ministry of Higher Education to expressly stipulate that the ideological and political work of schools should be personally led by the principals and presidents. It is suggested that the State Council convene regular meetings every year to check the ideological and political education work of teachers and students in schools, just like checking the implementation of teaching plans and checking scientific research and academic discussions.
    1. We demand the strengthening of the Party committee system in schools. We resolutely oppose the nonsense of rightists in schools who want to abolish the Party committee system. The ideological and political work of the several Sichuan higher education institutions I have inspected and the school where I work is not too strong, but too weak. We should vigorously strengthen the leadership of the Party committee in schools and equip them with cadres of a certain quality.
    In addition to directly leading the Communist Youth League, the Party committee in schools should also strengthen the Party's leadership over mass organizations such as the trade union and student union. It should designate special personnel to be responsible for this and regularly discuss the work of the trade union and student union.
    In order to strengthen the education of over-age League members, it is recommended that the Party committee and the Communist Youth League organize them, strengthen education under the leadership of the Party committee, and help them better transform themselves and create conditions for joining the Party faster.
    The full-time cadres of the Party, League, and trade union, in addition to especially strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and ideological transformation, should fully utilize the characteristics and laws of school work, self-study or take a few basic professional courses each year, step by step, and gradually become familiar with the school's main teaching business. In order to make ideological education work more thorough and detailed.
    2. We demand the strengthening of the work of the Marxism-Leninism teaching and research office in schools. The teachers of political courses in schools should become the ideological and theoretical work force of the school's Party committee. They have played, are playing, and will play a greater role in the ideological work of the school. They should insist on the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism among teachers and students, and wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism. Many of them are young teachers, whose advantage is that they are energetic, and whose shortcoming is that they lack practice and are divorced from reality. The current requirement is to further overcome the problem of dogmatism. However, we must distinguish between our anti-dogmatism and the nonsense of the rightists' anti-dogmatism. Their anti-dogmatism is to abolish Marxism-Leninism. Our anti-dogmatism is to improve the combat effectiveness of Marxism-Leninism. Teachers of political theory courses should actively participate in the school's ideological and political work. We oppose the past view that participating in ideological and political work hinders theoretical research.
    3. We demand the strengthening of the study of current affairs and policies in schools. Party newspapers are good teachers for teachers and students to study current affairs and policies. A newspaper is like a vivid encyclopedia, and teachers and students should not be without it for a day. The school Party committee, Communist Youth League, and trade union should organize and lead the study of current affairs and policies of all teachers and students in the college, and create conditions to make the study frequent and in-depth.
    If the work in the above aspects can be achieved, the ideological and political work of colleges and universities will be greatly strengthened. Only then can we achieve what Premier Zhou said in his report: "Educational departments and school teachers at all levels should strengthen the education of students in light of their ideological situation, and cultivate them into hard-working, simple, and talented people who are loyal to the cause of socialism and who combine physical labor and mental labor in the construction of the country."
    We must remember Chairman Mao's words: "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul." Intellectuals urgently need to continue to transform themselves. If they do not transform themselves, they will fall behind. We should strive to study Marxism. I hope that our teachers and students in our schools will never be soulless people.
    Please give your comments, fellow representatives.

### 应该特别加强学校的思想政治工作  李伯钊的发言

专栏：

    应该特别加强学校的思想政治工作
    李伯钊的发言
    我同意周恩来总理和其他各项报告。
    在周恩来总理的报告里提到：从最近整风运动暴露出来的情况看来，我们应该特别加强学校的思想政治工作。我体会到这个问题的深刻意义，所以我想讲一讲这个问题，就教于各位代表。
    今年四月十二日，我从北京动身到四川选区视察，在成都和重庆两地视察了四川医学院、四川大学、重庆大学、西南师范学院、西南音专、西南美专等六所高等院校。有的院校看一天，有的看两天，也有只看半天的。总的说来，四川高等院校的工作，在高教部和四川省委、省人民委员会领导下，成绩是显著的，发展是较快的。诸如各院校的校舍建筑，美观适用；环境优美；风景宜人。难怪苏联朋友夸奖说：“四川高等学校的校舍好像一座大花园。”各院校教学设备均有一定的规模，师资力量比较充实，有许多国内外有数的科学家，艺术家，在学校任教。解放以来，为祖国培养了许多人材。如果要问问这些院校工作中也有缺点么？也是有的。就是学校中思想政治工作的薄弱是较为普遍而颇带有根本性的毛病。在我参加几个学校各种座谈的时候，许多教员和学生代表也异口同声的说：“我们学校思想政治工作薄弱，教师和学生思想上存在许多问题。”下面就是他们所反映的整风前同学和教师的一些较为典型的思想情况的事例：师范学院的学生毕了业，不愿意当中学教师。据西南师范学院教育系教授张敷荣和数学系代主任王秀泉反映：该校同学一般不愿作中学教师，却热中于搞科学研究。因此，在学习上，只强调专业学习如何如何重要，不愿学教育学和教学法。又四川大学数学系助理黄枢说：数学系今年本科毕业生共有八十多人，他们中有百分之八十以上的人愿作高等学校的助教工作，要向科学进军，申明不愿意到厂矿工作。认为到厂矿工作，提高、升级慢。其中仅有一两个人毕业后愿意到中学作人民教师。大学生中部分人不安心所学专业，对树立专业思想缺乏信心。四川大学历史系的同学代表说：有百分之三十的学生不安心历史专业的学习，认为学历史专业是末路，没出息。低年级同学树立专业思想最困难。学校中较普遍存在着：学生不尊重老师、教学辅助人员，同学瞧不起行政职工，不尊重行政工作人员的劳动，小看他们。在教师中，否定一切的现象不是个别的。各学校，在总结几年来的教学改革工作时，都有一些人在检查学习苏联的先进经验有教条主义的缺点后，全部否定了学习苏联经验的成绩。对当前国家重大政治生活中的若干问题认识不清。例如：对民主与自由，在部分教师中认识有错误。据重庆大学姜修尚代理系主任反映：有少数教师认为民主与集中相结合就会妨碍“放”。以为个人意见一经集中就没有了。也有少数教师认为加强政治思想教育与“放”有矛盾。他们说：既然要放，就应该让大家完全自由，不应加以束缚。各学校有不少同学由于对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针政策缺乏正确理解，有些同学竟错误的运用这个方针来反对集体活动。有的学校的教师只教书，不教人的情形较为严重，那里谈得上因材施教呢？许多教师与学生大多只在课堂上见面，课余很少接触。
    从上述事例，可以看出这几个学校的某些老师和学生都存在着复杂的思想情况。学生中个人的志趣与集体利益之间有矛盾。学生与老师和行政职工之间有矛盾。高年级学生比低年级学生思想复杂些，老师比同学的思想更复杂些。有关民主的解说；民主集中制；“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策，各有各的理解，各有各的主张，是非不明，认识不清。对国家的基本制度、时事政策的学习，似嫌不够。对政治思想工作有误解等等。学生毕竟是受教育者，而老师则是学生的先生，引路的人。青年人的政治兴趣、生活习惯，常常拿先生作样子，更应当重视。进一步的考查，又发现学校政治思想工作中，还有两大空白：一是党团员一般尚能通过党团组织，进行一些党员团员的教育。一般学生群众，是大专学校的多数。他们的思想教育却成了大空白。二是超龄团员。目前各大专学校对青年教师中超龄团员的工作悬而未决。他们已经不是一般的青年人，因而用对青年进行思想教育的方式方法对他们进行工作早已不适合了。可是他们又不是党员。实际上，党和团对他们都不大管。超龄团员在各高等学校的讲师和助教中占着不小的数字，如何关心和帮助他们的进步，填补这一空白点呢？都需要研究解决。由此可见，学校的思想政治教育工作必须加强，这还是通常情况下的情形。
    在北京，当章罗联盟猖狂向党进攻、大量放毒、乱鸣乱放的高潮中，反映到学校里也是一场剧烈的斗争，比通常学校情况复杂何只千倍、万倍。即以中央戏剧学院大鸣大放中实例来看，不能不令人吃惊。可以说社会上有什么，学院就有什么。当然，学院大多数老师学生仍是满腔热情，帮助党整风。其中也有慷慨激昂，说错话，说过头的。这不用去提起。当人民日报发表葛佩琦文章的当天，学院就有卡萩莎命名的大字报转载出来，且将其中最反动的词句用碗大的红字刊出，惟恐读者略过。立刻出现了有拥护派、反对派和不赞成也不反对派，斗争马上展开。火点着了。社会上出现了给卢郁文的恐吓信，在学院就有在教师的煽动下，一学生向学院领导提出的最后通牒。
    当光明日报发表了储安平的“党天下”反动言论，学院里就有戏剧理论教研室助教共青团员陈汀沙写的“朕即是党”替储安平传播毒素。紧接着，他又在党分总支门上题反诗。他无条件的作了章伯钧罗隆基的应声虫。
    在社会上有右派的教授向党猖狂进攻，在学院就有民盟中央妇女委员会委员、北京市民盟委员孙家琇教授在民盟支部召开的控诉会后，哭述一篇“幻灭了的和希望着的”文章来，这篇文章的原文摘录如下：
    “……感谢马列主义教会我辩证的看问题，我明白这是党的真理教会我看见党员的缺陷，……但是你们的三大主义，以及种种其他行为，在剥夺摧毁人的理想，窒息了人们的事业心，堵塞了青年人的朝气，欺骗了学生们的信仰，这是不是罪恶？这该不该群起而诛之？…………………
    我不能不用莎士比亚的话给你们照照镜子。
    对这些都倦了，我哭求安息的死——
    譬如，见到才能注定要做乞丐，
    空虚的无物倒打扮得漂漂亮亮？
    最纯洁的信仰被不幸地破坏，
    灿烂的荣誉被可耻的放错了地位，
    处女般的贞洁遭到强奸，
    邪恶，不法地侮辱了正义的完美，
    艺术，被权威捆住了口舌，
    愚蠢（俨如博士）控制着学术，
    单纯的真理被唤作呆笨，
    被俘的‘善’侍候着‘恶’将军，
    对这些都倦了，我要离开人间，
    只是，我死了，要使我爱人孤单。
    三百年前的黑暗世界是这个样子，难道我们要重复忍受痛苦？我们早就超过了莎士比亚，我们活在莎士比亚前人们所向往的时代里，不是我要破坏社会主义，把人们拉回到三百年前去，而是你们正在把我们拉回去。”
    孙家琇教授是头顶着马列主义招牌，身披着莎士比亚的纱衣，装扮成一位正直教授，向党进攻的。中央戏剧学院被她形容成了人间地狱，暗无天日。最狠毒的是她用莎士比亚三百年前诅咒当时黑暗专制王朝悲剧性的时代的诗篇来攻击党，攻击新社会制度，反无耻的说：“不是我要破坏社会主义，把人们拉回到三百年前去，而是你们正在把我们拉回去。”亲爱的教授，我们平常尊敬她，敬仰她，因为她有学问，对莎士比亚的诗篇有些研究，只望她用以教导青年，引导同学接受人类文化宝贵的珍宝。我们马克思主义者认为对待莎士比亚这世界艺术的高峰，应该公平对待。不要像欧美资产阶级败类那样，把他拉回到遥远的古代去，或者，把莎士比亚作品中的人物过分的摩登化替“汉姆莱特”穿上燕尾服，而要真实的发扬他作品中不朽的本来的事物。莎士比亚悲剧是特定历史时代的产物，在莎士比亚时代，有一些人，有一些社会力量，是时代的先驱者；也有一些社会力量是我们敌人的祖先。在诗人眼中谁是敌人，谁是朋友，是清楚的。为什么要糟蹋他的作品，混淆是非，拿他的诗篇进攻新社会。是教授想把青年拉到遥远的古代去，还是我们硬把教授拉回三百年呢？道理在那一边，不是很清楚吗？教授错了。我们欢迎教授回头，教授不是还有希望着的那句话吗？
    最后学院出来一位盟员，利用卡萩莎报社组织自由论坛，公开叫嚣：要求共产党退出学院云云。原来如此。这和章罗联盟右派的纲领如出一辙，没有两样。我们不能不注视民盟某些盟员的方向了。倒底他们为右派集团怎么效劳的？
    戏剧学院是一所年青的高等院校，从无到有，解放以前那有学院开设演员、导演、舞台美术、戏剧文学等专业呢？实事求是的回顾一下建院迄今，在高教部文化部领导下成绩仍是主要的。有许多错误缺点，而且比较严重，但绝不是一团漆黑，我们正在满怀信心的改进工作。
    学院正在向右派分子大举反扑，如火如荼全院师生起来和右派分子在思想上划清界线，不胜利，不收兵。斗争中以上犯过错误的同志，某些迷失了方向的同志，正在进行检查。
    真的，在这短短的整风时期中，我们看到的事情，比平常几年还多。不经过整风，那里晓得工作的深浅、高低。我们看清楚了许多事，看清楚了许多人。懂得了一条真理：学院终究是社会的缩影。社会上右派分子向党进攻的阶级斗争，反映到学校竟是如此剧烈。从此，我们懂得原来学校中不仅存在着与社会主义矛盾的资产阶级思想，并且还有右派分子的阴谋活动。只怪平素脑筋太麻痹了。社会上阶级斗争剧烈，学院里阶级斗争也不简单。又一次严重的教训：办学院不能脱离政治。
    总之，无论从通常情况下，和大鸣大放情况下揭发出来的大是大非看；都说明特别应该加强学校的思想政治工作。
    周恩来总理提出：学校应当加强思想政治工作的意见是非常适时的。学校应该特别加强思想政治工作的目的，就是通过教学、学术讨论、科学研究、党团思想教育，在教师和学生中经常批判资产阶级唯心主义，树立无产阶级辩证唯物主义的世界观。思想政治工作是学校百年大计的建设工作。毛主席说：思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。共产党应该管，青年团应该管，政府主管部门应该管，学校的校长教师更应该管。希望国务院和二办责成高教部明文规定：学校的思想政治工作应由校院长亲自负责领导。建议国务院每年定期召开会议，检查学校师生思想政治教育工作。如像检查教学计划执行情况，检查科学研究、学术讨论情况一样。
    一、我们要求加强学校的党委制。坚决反对右派分子在学校取消党委制的谰言。我所视察过的几所四川高等学校和我自己工作的学校思想政治工作不是太强了，而是弱了。应该大力加强学校党委领导，配备一定质量的干部。
    学校中党委除了直接领导共青团还应该加强党对工会、学生会这些群众组织的领导，应该指定专人负责，定期讨论工会和学生会的工作。
    为了加强对超龄团员的教育，建议党委和共青团把他们组织起来，由党委领导，加强教育，帮助他们更好的改造自己，更快的创造入党条件。
    专职的党、团、工会的干部除了应特别加强马列主义学习，思想改造，应该充分运用学校工作的特点与规律，逐年自修，或选修几门专业基础课程，循序渐进，逐步熟习学校的主要教学业务。以便将思想教育工作作得更深入细致。
    二、我们要求加强学校马列主义教研室的工作。学校政治课的教师应当成为学校党委思想理论工作的队伍。他们过去、现在、将来对学校的思想工作都能发挥较大作用。要在师生中坚持马克思列宁主义辩证唯物主义的宣传，同修正主义作不妥协的斗争。他们中有不少的青年教师，优点是有朝气，不足的地方是缺少实践、脱离实际。目前的要求是进一步的克服教条主义的毛病。但是我们反教条主义和右派分子的反教条主义的谰言，必须区别开来。他们反教条主义就是取消马列主义。我们反教条主义，是为了提高马列主义的战斗力。政治理论课的教员要积极的参加学校的思想政治工作。一反过去认为参加思想政治工作妨害理论研究的提法。
    三、我们要求加强学校时事政策的学习。党报是老师和学生学习时事政策良好的教师。一张报纸，有如一本生动活泼的百科全书，老师和学生，不可一日不读。学校党委、共青团、工会应该组织领导全院师生的时事政策学习，创造条件使学习经常并深入。
    若能作到上述各个方面的工作，大专学校的思想政治工作将大大加强。也才能作到如周总理报告中所说：“各级教育部门和学校教师要针对着学生的思想情况加强对学生的教育，培养他们成为忠实于社会主义事业的勤劳、朴素的，体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的国家建设人才。”
    我们要记住毛主席的话：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”知识分子迫切需要继续改造，不改造就要落后，我们应该努力学习马克思主义。我希望我们学校的老师和学生，绝不作一个没有灵魂的人。
    请各位代表指教。
