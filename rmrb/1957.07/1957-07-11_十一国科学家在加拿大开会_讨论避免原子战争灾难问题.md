Eleven-Nation Scientists Meet in Canada
Discussing the Issue of Avoiding the Disaster of Atomic War

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 10th: Twenty-four scientists from eleven countries convened a meeting in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Canada, on the 8th, to discuss the issue of avoiding an atomic disaster. Chinese scientist Zhou Peiyuan attended the meeting. Representatives from countries including the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and Japan participated in the meeting.

Lord Russell, the 85-year-old British philosopher and the main organizer of the meeting, was unable to attend in person due to health reasons. He sent Professor Rotblat as his representative. The meeting listened to a recorded speech by Russell. In his speech, Russell said: If war breaks out now, it will inevitably become a nuclear war, and nuclear war will inevitably become an "incalculable disaster."

Russell said: "The meeting must consider, as a matter of unavoidable duty, the old problem of abolishing war. Our generation faces the task of either solving this problem or witnessing the destruction of everything finest that mankind's highest wisdom, perseverance, and resources have created over the millennia."

Japanese scientist Hideki Yukawa brought a petition from a Japanese "World Peace Committee" calling for a ban on hydrogen bomb and atomic bomb testing.

Hideki Yukawa said, "Our first goal is to temporarily halt testing for several months, and let scientists determine whether such tests are safe. If the tests are proven to be harmful, we will recommend a complete and permanent ban."

He said, "We are in favor of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but we oppose its use for making weapons."

The meeting is scheduled to conclude on the 10th.

    十一国科学家在加拿大开会
    讨论避免原子战争灾难问题
    新华社10日讯　渥太华消息：来自十一个国家的二十四位科学家8日在加拿大诺法斯科细亚省浦华希举行会议，讨论避免原子灾难问题。中国科学家周培源出席了这个会议。参加会议的有苏联、英、美、日本等国的代表。
    这次会议的主要筹备人、八十五岁的英国哲学家罗素因健康关系未能亲自参加会议，他派了罗特布拉特教授作他的代表。会议听取了罗素的一篇录音发言。罗素在发言中说：如果现在发生战争，它无可避免地会成为一次核战争，而核战争势将成为一种“无法估计的灾难”。
    罗素说：“会议必须义不容辞地考虑废除战争这个老问题。我们这一代面临着这样一种任务：或者是解决这个问题，或者是目睹数千年来人类的最高智慧、毅力和资源所创造的一切最美好的东西横遭毁灭”。
    日本科学家汤川秀树带来了日本的一个“世界和平委员会”的呼吁书，要求禁止氢弹和原子弹试验。
    汤川秀树说，“我们的第一个目标是暂时停止试验若干月，而由科学家来决定这种试验是不是安全。如果证明试验是有害的，我们将建议全面和永久禁止。”
    他说，“我们赞成核能用于和平，但是反对把它用来制作武器。”
    会议预定在10日结束。
