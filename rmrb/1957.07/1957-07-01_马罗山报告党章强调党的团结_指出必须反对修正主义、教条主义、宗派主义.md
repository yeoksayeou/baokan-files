Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 30th. Marosán delivered a report on the Party Constitution at the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party National Congress, which opened on June 27th.

Marosán first pointed out that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is the successor to the revolutionary cause of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Hungarian Working People's Party, the inheritor of the traditions of the workers' movement before the establishment of the Hungarian Communist Party, and the inheritor of the unity of workers embodied by the establishment of the Hungarian Working People's Party. The name of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party also embodies the unity established by the Hungarian Working People's Party. The Party should pay attention to maintaining a relationship of mutual trust with former members of the Labor People's Party, including former Social Democratic comrades, who have not yet joined the Party.

Marosán said that the Central Committee clearly saw the sectarian and dogmatic errors made by the past leadership and their consequences, and fought to correct these errors. However, the Central Committee recognizes the great achievements of the Labor People's Party's twelve years of work, opposes the enemies and slanderers of socialism, and defends these achievements.

When discussing the Party's leading role, Marosán pointed out that the Party's leading role has been misunderstood and distorted in many places. The correct principle that the Party's leading role and political-ideological leadership need to be realized through communists working in state organs, economic and social organizations has been neglected, and the Party's leadership has often been limited to issuing instructions and orders. This has damaged the Party's prestige and weakened the masses' trust in the Party.

The draft Party Constitution stipulates that the Socialist Workers' Party is the vanguard of the working class and the party of the working people. It unites the most progressive forces of the Hungarian people, uniting the best people among the working class, working peasants, and intellectuals. Our Party will not be as large as the Labor People's Party, but it will be more distinctly class-based and more united.

Marosán talked about the importance of Party unity and consolidation. He said that the Party can only carry out a victorious struggle if it is ideologically, politically, and organizationally united. However, this unity is by no means unprincipled. We once paid a great price for allowing revisionists to lay the foundation for counter-revolution within the Party. The October events require every party member not only to be more vigilant, but also to actively engage in the struggle to expose the enemy.

The draft Party Constitution states that the Party can only accomplish its tasks by resolutely opposing all deviations and defending Party unity. The Party must oppose revisionism, dogmatism, and sectarianism. No factional activities are allowed within the Party. One of the most important links in Party unity is the unity of Party leadership.

Next, he talked about the obligations of leaders. He said that the issue of Party unity is closely related to the implementation of the principle of democratic centralism. Revisionist interpretations of democratic centralism are the worst, because they undermine the conscious discipline of the proletariat and the authority of the central leading organs and Party resolutions. Democratic centralism is the organizational principle of the Party. At present, while defending democracy, it is necessary to strengthen centralism.

    马罗山报告党章强调党的团结
    指出必须反对修正主义、教条主义、宗派主义
    据新华社布达佩斯30日电　马罗山在6月27日开幕的匈牙利社会主义工人党全国代表会议上作了关于党章的报告。
    马罗山首先指出，匈牙利社会主义工人党是匈牙利共产党和匈牙利劳动人民党革命事业的继承者，是匈牙利共产党成立以前工人运动传统的继承者，是由劳动人民党的成立而体现出来的工人团结的继承者。匈牙利社会主义工人党这一名称同样体现了匈牙利劳动人民党所建立起来的团结。党应该注意同现在尚未入党的前劳动人民党党员，包括前社会民主党同志们保持互相信任的关系。
    马罗山说，中央委员会清楚地看到过去领导所犯的宗派主义和教条主义的错误及其后果，并且为纠正这些错误而斗争。但是中央委员会承认劳动人民党十二年工作的伟大成就，反对社会主义的敌人和诽谤者，保卫这些成就。
    马罗山在谈到党的领导作用时指出，党的领导作用在很多地方被误解了和歪曲了，党的领导作用、政治思想上的领导需要通过在国家机关、经济和社会组织中工作的共产党员来实现这一正确的原则被忽视了，常常把党的领导限制在指示和发布命令上。这就损害了党的威信，削弱了群众对党的信任。
    党章草案规定，社会主义工人党是工人阶级的先锋队，是劳动人民的党。它团结了匈牙利人民中最进步的力量，团结了工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子中的最优秀人物。我们的党员不会像劳动人民党那样多，但是阶级性更显著，更团结。
    马罗山谈到党的团结和巩固的重要性。他说，党只有在思想、政治和组织上团结一致，党才能进行胜利的斗争。但是，这种团结决不是无原则的。我们曾经因为让修正主义者在党内为反革命打下基础而付出了很大的代价。十月事件要求每个党员不仅要提高警惕性，并且要积极投入揭露敌人的斗争。
    党章草案说，党只有在坚决反对一切偏向的斗争和保卫党的团结中，才能完成自己的任务。党必需反对修正主义、教条主义、宗派主义。党内不容许任何派别活动。党内团结的一个最重要的环节是党的领导的团结。
    接着，他谈到领导者的义务。他说，党的团结的问题与实现民主集中制原则是密切相关的。对民主集中制进行修正主义的解释是最坏不过的，因为它破坏无产阶级的自觉纪律，破坏中央领导机构和党的决议的威信。民主集中制是党的组织原则。目前在保卫民主的同时，必需加强集中。
