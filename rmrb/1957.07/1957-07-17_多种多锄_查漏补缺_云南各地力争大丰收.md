Kunming Dispatch: Agricultural cooperatives in Yunnan Province have entered the stage of mid-season plowing and summer hoeing. During this process, various regions are exploring ways to increase production and striving for a bumper harvest. In Chuxiong, Yuxi, Qujing, Mengzi, Dali, and other places, many agricultural cooperatives are utilizing idle land, waste land, and field edges for planting, and reclaiming small plots of wasteland to increase yields. Yuxi region has proposed a campaign to promote multiple planting, intensive cultivation, checking for omissions, and filling gaps. The region estimates that intercropping, relay planting, and planting of minor grains, oilseeds, and fodder crops on field bunds alone will increase grain production by more than five million jin. In Xiangyun County, more than 18 types of early-maturing crops are intercropped on more than 130,000 mu of land, which is expected to increase the county's production by more than 9,000 jin of minor grains and tubers. To ensure a bumper harvest, Heping Township in Suijiang County conducted a major field inspection after transplanting seedlings to check the seedlings, check the planting holes, check the field edges and corners, and check crop growth. They calculated accounts while checking, and mobilized the commune members to immediately fill the loopholes. More than 60 agricultural cooperatives in Lijiang County conducted detailed surveys and tests on all the land, and applied fertilizers with different properties according to the results of the soil tests. Agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas with water shortages and sandy loam soils have developed plans to increase the number of cultivations to maintain soil moisture, changing the past practice of blindly applying fertilizer and blindly improving the soil. Staff members of agricultural technology promotion stations in Zhaotong, Huize, Simao, Yiliang, and other counties have gone deep into the fields to help agricultural cooperatives summarize and promote advanced production experiences. Some agricultural technology promotion stations have also transferred some staff members to high and cold mountainous areas to help agricultural cooperatives improve agricultural technology and strive for a bumper harvest.

    多种多锄　查漏补缺
    云南各地力争大丰收
    本报昆明电　云南省各地农业社的生产活动已进入中耕夏锄阶段。在中耕夏锄中，各地都在千方百计地寻找增产窍门，争取农业大丰收。楚雄、玉溪、曲靖、蒙自、大理等地很多农业社利用闲田废地、田边地角进行种植，开垦小片荒地增加产量。玉溪地区各县提出开展多栽多种、查漏补缺运动。全区仅间种、套种及田埂地角种植小杂粮、小油料、饲料一项，预计将增产杂粮五百多万斤。祥云县在十三万多亩地里分别间种十八种早熟作物，预计全县能多增产九千多斤小杂粮和薯类。绥江县和平乡为保证农业大丰收，在栽插结束后开展了田间大检查：查苗、查窝、查田边地角、查作物成长情况等。他们边查边算账，动员社员立即弥补漏洞。丽江县六十多个农业社把所有的土地进行了详细的调查和化验，按照土壤化验结果，分别加施不同性能的肥料。在山区水源缺乏和多砂壤土地区的农业社，订出了增加中耕次数保持土壤水份的计划，改变了过去盲目施肥、盲目改良土壤的现象。昭通、会泽、思茅、宜良等县农业技术推广站的工作人员，已经深入田间，帮助农业社总结、推广先进生进经验。有些农业技术推广站还抽调部分工作人员深入高寒山区，帮助农业社提高农业技术，争取丰收。
