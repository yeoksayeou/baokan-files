We fully support the various reports made by Premier Zhou and the responsible comrades at the conference. Premier Zhou's report made us deeply appreciate the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party. The remarkable achievements of the People's Government in the past period are unprecedented. The first Five-Year Plan for national economic development, under the wise leadership of the Party and the Government and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, has definitely been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, and has laid a favorable foundation for the second Five-Year Plan. What an exciting thing this is! The various figures eloquently show that our country's achievements in industrial and agricultural production are the main aspect. The development of industrial production has initially changed the backward agricultural country's face and guaranteed the industrial equipment and technical force needed for national economic construction. Although agricultural production suffered from severe natural disasters last year, thanks to the great achievements of agricultural cooperativization, the production level of major crops was still maintained, and the farmers were helped to overcome the disasters. This confirms the superiority of the socialist system. Only by following the socialist road can our country's productive forces achieve unprecedented development, thereby creating a favorable prerequisite for improving the material and cultural life of the people of the whole country. Shortcomings are only minor and easily overcome. We will never allow anyone to use the Party's rectification campaign as an opportunity to spread poison and engage in shameless anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. We resolutely draw a clear line between them in politics and ideology. Their reactionary remarks and behaviors are poisonous weeds, and they are not worth mentioning in front of the people. The Chinese people who have stood up have sharp eyes and can recognize what is a flower and what is a poisonous weed. After everyone recognized the reactionary features of the Rightists, how indignant they were! They expressed irreconcilable hatred for their harmfulness. We hope that they will turn back as soon as possible, seriously examine and correct their mistakes, and not cut themselves off from the people. We will never allow capitalism to be restored in our country, and we will never allow our country to go back to the miserable road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. We industrialists and businessmen, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the Rightists and fight them to the end.

    Denounce Zhang Naiqi

    In the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Rightists, Zhang Naiqi has consistently distorted the Party's policies and used the methods of uglifying the working class and beautifying the bourgeoisie to cater to the negativity existing in the industrial and commercial circles. The poison he spreads is very harmful to the industrial and commercial circles. For example, the students of the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Short-Term Training Class were influenced by his fallacies and echoed the denial of the duality of the bourgeoisie, the denial of the essential difference between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and the denial that fixed interest is exploitation, etc., thereby relaxing the self-transformation of the industrialists and businessmen and their enthusiasm for active work. Some people even unilaterally demanded labor protection, welfare benefits, and living standards. His series of absurd remarks are clearly an attempt to oppose the leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, and to oppose our people's construction of socialism and taking the socialist road. We believe that this is by no means a question of ideology and speech, but a question of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The industrialists and businessmen in Beijing have gradually recognized Zhang Naiqi's true reactionary features through the struggle against the Rightists and condemned his attempt to drag us back to the capitalist road. At present, Zhang Naiqi still insists on his mistakes, which is really infuriating. We demand that Zhang Naiqi's mistakes be dealt with seriously, and that he quickly correct his mistakes and not cut himself off from the people.

    Since the beginning of the struggle against the Rightists, we have further exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the Rightists Yan Shaoqing, Wu Jincui, and Zhang Huanyao in the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing. From their self-criticisms, it can also be clearly seen that their reactionary words and deeds have their own historical and ideological roots. Their reactionary remarks also have their harmfulness in the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing, and they were also influenced by Zhang Naiqi's fallacies, which is why they are so arrogant. From everyone's exposure, it was also said that Zhang Huanyao attempted to pull Wu Jincui and Yan Shaoqing to talk to Zhang Naiqi. We have already asked Zhang Huanyao to explain his relationship with Zhang Naiqi, and we must also ask Zhang Naiqi to examine himself.

    Our two local organizations, the Beijing Municipal Democratic National Construction Association (Minjian) and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, under the leadership of the Party, are carrying out the work of fighting against all Rightists together with the city's industrialists and businessmen. We also invited Comrade Sun Xiaocun to give a report to the short-term training class. After listening to the report, some students expressed indignation at the poison they had been subjected to by the Rightists in the past. For example, one student said: "After listening to Zhang Naiqi's words, I almost forgot all the gains I had made in the two months of study. Fortunately, Teacher Sun's report saved me!" Some study groups wrote letters jointly in the name of the whole group, stating that they had been poisoned by Zhang Naiqi in the past, and today they want to draw a clear ideological line with him and resolutely follow the bright road of socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the struggle against the Rightists, the industrialists and businessmen in Beijing have improved their thinking and their political sense of smell has also become sharper. Everyone said: All Rightists are harmful vixens, and we must oppose them to the end and never allow them to sow discord between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and never allow capitalism to be restored in our country! They resolutely and unanimously said that they want to listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the bright and happy socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, so that the industrialists and businessmen can smoothly pass through the transition period and change themselves into self-reliant laborers. Therefore, on behalf of all private personnel in industry and commerce in Beijing, we fully support Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on February 27 and Premier Zhou's government work report. We must strengthen our study, strengthen our self-transformation, improve our thinking, and launch a resolute struggle against the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists!

    Denounce Bi Mingqi
    Industrial and commercial representatives:

    We firmly disagree with the self-criticism made by the Rightist Bi Mingqi at the conference this morning. We believe that the vicious influence of the series of anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies he has published in the industrial and commercial circles is as serious as that of Zhang Naiqi.

    Today, at the solemn conference, he still holds a dishonest attitude, lightly and briefly pretends to self-criticize, and attempts to muddle through, which we can never allow.

    We want to warn Bi Mingqi that only by thoroughly confessing the two-faced tactics you have consistently used since the founding of the country, pretending to be positive on the one hand, and using despicable means such as instigation and distortion on the other hand, to carry out all anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies, and the facts of your actions that have been detrimental to the industrial and commercial circles accepting socialist transformation, can you thoroughly repent and not cut yourself off from the people.

    The Issue of Traditional Chinese Medicine

    I would now like to express some personal opinions on the issue of traditional Chinese medicine:

    At present, the supply of traditional Chinese medicine in the market is insufficient, and some medicinal materials are often out of stock. What is the reason for this? I believe that the first reason is that the living standards of the people in both urban and rural areas have improved after liberation. In the past, people did not have the conditions to see doctors and take medicine, but now they can afford to take medicine, so the demand for medicinal materials has been increasing year by year. Taking Beijing as an example, according to the statistics of the Municipal Pharmaceutical Company, in the first quarter of 1957, the total turnover of the traditional Chinese medicine industry in the city reached more than 6.22 million yuan (including 2.43 million yuan for state-owned households and 3.29 million yuan for joint state-private households), an increase of 55.5% over the same period in 1956. At present, the production of Chinese medicinal materials is still far from meeting the demand. At the same time, most medicinal materials are agricultural crops, and production is affected by some natural conditions. Some production areas have encountered floods and typhoons, which will inevitably lead to reduced production, thus presenting a situation of supply falling short of demand.

    Secondly, I believe that some departments have not paid enough attention to the production and purchase of medicinal materials. The purchase prices of some medicinal materials are too low, and some medicinal materials are not priced according to quality during purchase, which affects the enthusiasm of farmers for production. At the same time, it is also because the nature of medicinal materials is relatively complex, the types are numerous, the production areas are vast, and the production of medicinal materials is related to industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and commerce. However, the leadership relationship of the institutions operating medicinal materials has changed frequently in recent years, pushing back and forth, and handing over back and forth, which has also affected the normal development of the medicinal material business. In less than three years from 1955 to the present, the leadership relationship of the pharmaceutical companies has changed three times. In early 1955, pharmaceutical companies at all levels were established one after another in various places, under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce, changing the past situation of decentralized operation by supply and marketing cooperatives, native products, and trade companies. However, after the National Pharmaceutical Materials Professional Conference in 1955, it was transferred from the Ministry of Commerce to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives. In less than a year, after the Second National Pharmaceutical Materials Professional Conference in 1956, it was transferred from the cooperatives to the commercial departments for leadership. In less than a year, at the National Pharmaceutical Materials System Managers Conference held in April this year, it was decided to transfer the Chinese medicinal materials institutions from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Health. In this way, the pharmaceutical companies are constantly handling handovers, and business operations are inevitably affected. I think this cannot be considered one of the reasons for the problem.

    In order to solve the current supply problem of medicinal materials, I suggest:

    (1) Appropriately adjust the purchase prices of some medicinal materials and price them according to quality. In particular, for medicinal materials that are in short supply, farmers should be encouraged to produce them.

    (2) Strengthen the leadership of the medicinal material business. Pharmaceutical companies should still be under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Commerce and should not be assigned to the Ministry of Health. However, the Ministry of Health should supervise the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

    (3) Improve the work of medicinal material reserves and appropriately increase some necessary equipment. Some medicinal materials should maintain a certain reserve volume to meet emergency needs.

### 一切右派分子都是害人的狐狸精  乐松生、浦洁修代表的联合发言

    一切右派分子都是害人的狐狸精
    乐松生、浦洁修代表的联合发言
    我们完全拥护周总理和各位负责同志在大会上所作的各项报告。周总理的报告，使我们深深体会到中国共产党的伟大。人民政府在过去一段工作中的卓越成就，是史无前例的。国民经济第一个五年计划，在党和政府英明领导下全国人民的共同努力，已经可以肯定提前和超额完成了，并为第二个五年计划打下有利的基础，这是多么令人兴奋的事情啊！从各项数字中，雄辩地说明了我国的工农业生产的成绩是主要的，工业生产的发展已经初步改变了过去落后的农业国的面貌，保证了国家经济建设所需要的工业设备和技术力量，农业生产虽然遭受到去年严重的自然灾害，但是由于农业合作化的伟大成就，仍然保持主要农作物的生产水平，帮助了农民度过了灾荒，这证实了社会主义制度的优越性。只有遵循着社会主义的道路，才能使我国的生产力获得空前未有的发展，从而为改善全国人民的物质和文化生活创造有利的前提。缺点只是微乎其微，也是容易克服的。我们绝不允许任何人借着党整风的机会，散播毒素，进行反党反社会主义的无耻勾当，我们坚决和他们划清在政治上和思想上的界限，他们的反动言论和行为，就是毒草，在人民面前是不值一击的，站起来的中国人民眼睛是雪亮的，能够认识到什么是鲜花，什么是毒草，大家在认识到右派分子的反动面貌以后，是多么愤慨呀！对他们的危害性，表示不共戴天之仇。我们希望他们及早回头，认真检讨和改正他们的错误，不要自绝于人民。我们绝不允许资本主义在我国复辟，绝不允许我们国家再走回到半封建半殖民地的悲惨道路上去，我们工商业者和全国人民一道坚决反对右派分子，和他们进行斗争到底。
    斥章乃器
    在右派分子反党反社会主义的言行中，章乃器一贯地歪曲党的政策，并以丑化工人阶级、美化资产阶级的手法，来迎合工商界中存在的消极性，他所散播的毒素，对于工商界来说，是有很大危害性的。如北京市工商界短期讲习班的学员，就受了他的谬论的影响，随声附和地否定资产阶级的两面性，否定工人阶级和资产阶级本质上的区别，否认定息是剥削等等，从而放松了工商业者的自我改造和积极工作的热情，甚至有少数人片面地要求劳保福利和生活待遇等。他的一系列的荒谬言论，显然是企图反对工人阶级和中国共产党的领导，反对我国人民建设社会主义、走社会主义道路。我们认为这绝不是什么思想上和言论上的问题，而是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路斗争的问题。北京市工商业者经过反右派分子的斗争，已逐步认清了章乃器的真实反动面貌，斥责他企图把我们拖回到资本主义道路的阴谋。目前章乃器仍然坚持错误，真是令人气愤，我们要求对章乃器的错误加以严肃处理，要求他迅速改正错误，不要自绝于人民。
    自从反右派分子斗争开始后，我们进一步揭发了北京市工商界中阎少青、吴金萃、张焕尧等右派分子的反党反社会主义的言论。从他们的检讨中，也可以清楚地看到，他们的反动言行有他们自己的历史根源和思想根源，他们的反动言论，同样在北京市工商界中有它的危害性，同时受到了章乃器谬论的影响，他们才是这样嚣张的。从大家的揭发中，还说出了张焕尧企图拉着吴金萃、阎少青和章乃器谈话，我们已经要求张焕尧交代他和章乃器的关系，我们也一定要章乃器自己检查一下。
    我们北京市民建和工商联两个地方组织，在党的领导下，和全市工商业者一道正展开与一切右派分子进行斗争的工作，我们也曾请孙晓村同志给短期讲习班作了报告。有的学员听了报告以后，对过去受右派分子的毒素，表示愤慨，如有的学员说：“听了章乃器的话，几乎把两个月的学习收获都忘干净了，幸而孙老师的报告，挽救了我！”有的学习小组全组联名写了信，表明他们过去中了章乃器的毒素，今天要与他划清思想界限，坚决跟着中国共产党走社会主义的光明大道。我们北京市工商业者在反右派斗争中，大家的思想有所提高，政治嗅觉也开始锐敏起来，大家说：一切右派分子都是害人的狐狸精，我们一定要反对他们到底，绝不允许他们挑拨工人阶级和资产阶级的关系，绝不允许资本主义在我国复辟！他们坚决地异口同声地说，要听毛主席的话，跟着中国共产党走光明幸福的社会主义道路，这样才可以使得工商业者平平稳稳地走过过渡时期的道路，改变自己成为一个自食其力的劳动者。因此，我们代表北京市工商业的全体私方人员，完全拥护毛主席二月二十七日在最高国务会议上的讲演和周总理的政府工作报告。我们一定要加强学习，加强自我改造，提高思想，对右派分子的反动言行展开坚决斗争！
    斥毕鸣岐工商业者代表们：
    我们坚决不同意右派分子毕鸣岐今早在大会上所作的检讨。我们认为他过去所发表的一系列反党反社会主义的谬论，在工商界中所起的恶毒影响，与章乃器一样有严重的危害性。
    今天他在庄严的大会上，还抱着不老实态度，避重就轻地假检讨一番，企图蒙混过关，我们是决不能允许的。
    我们要警告毕鸣岐，只有彻底交代你从开国以来一贯利用的两面派手法，一方面假积极；另一方面利用挑拨、歪曲等卑鄙手段，进行反党反社会主义的一切阴谋诡计，和你的行动所造成的不利于工商界接受社会主义改造的事实，才能痛改前非，不自绝于人民。
    国药问题
    我现在仅代表我个人就国药问题再发表点意见：
    目前市场上国药供应不足，部分药材经常脱销，这究竟是什么原因呢？我认为首先是由于解放后城乡人民生活提高，过去没有条件看病吃药的，现在也有能力吃药了，因而药材需要量逐年都在增加。以北京市为例，据市药材公司统计，一九五七年第一季度，全市国药业营业额即达到六百二十二万余元（其中国营户二百四十三万元，公私合营户三百二十九万元），比一九五六年同一时期增加了百分之五十五点五，而目前中药材的生产距离需要还差得多，同时药材大部是农作物，生产受到自然条件的一些影响，有的产区遇到水灾、风灾，势必就会减产，这样就呈现出供不应求的现象。
    其次，我认为是由于有的部门在药材生产和收购问题上注意得还不够，有一部分药材收购价格偏低，有的药材在收购时没有很好地按质论价，影响了农民生产的积极性。同时，还由于药材的性质比较复杂，种类繁多，产地广阔，生产药材和工业、农业、手工业、商业都有些联系，而几年来经营药材机构的领导关系却变动频繁，推来推去，往返交接，也影响了药材经营业务的正常开展。从一九五五年到现在还不到三年的时间，药材公司的领导关系就改变了三次。在一九五五年初，各地先后成立了各级药材公司，由商业部统一领导，改变了过去由供销社、土产、贸易等公司分散经营的状况。可是在一九五五年全国药材专业会议以后，又由商业部移交给全国供销合作总社。过了不到一年的时间，一九五六年第二次全国药材专业会议以后，又由合作社划归商业部门领导。又过了不到一年的时间，今年四月召开的全国药材系统经理会议上，又决定把中药材机构由商业部移交卫生部。就这样，药材公司常年在办理交接，在业务经营上难免受到了影响。我认为这不能不算问题的原因之一。
    为了解决当前药材供应问题，我建议：
    （1）适当调整部分药材的收购价格，按质论价。特别是货源不足的药材，应鼓励农民生产。
    （2）加强药材经营业务的领导。药材公司仍应由商业部统一领导，不应划归卫生部。但卫生部对药剂制造，应该进行监督。
    （3）改善药材储备工作，适当增加一些必要设备，有的药材应该保持一定的储备量，以应急需。
