    Pride Leads to Backwardness
    Leadership Has Taken Measures to Make Up for Lost Time
    Leaders of many basic construction units in Baotou felt that "this year we have great strength and small tasks, we can complete them without much effort," so they became lax and procrastinated, resulting in only 25% of the annual basic construction plan being completed in the first half of the year, creating a wasteful and passive situation of "idleness in spring, rush work in autumn, and crash work in winter."
    Special dispatch from our newspaper, Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, July 27th: Leaders of many basic construction units in Baotou have a relaxed attitude towards this year's basic construction plan. The consequence of this thinking is that only 25% of Baotou's basic construction plan was completed in the first half of the year. The situation of "idleness in spring, rush work in autumn, and crash work in winter" has become a certainty.
    Although there are some objective reasons for the poor completion of Baotou's basic construction plan in the first half of this year, such as the plan being finalized about three months later than in 1956 and design changes not keeping up with construction, the most important reason is the relaxed attitude of the leaders of the basic construction units. Many leaders of the city's relevant leading organs and construction and engineering units believe that this year the construction force is strong and the tasks are small, so they can be completed without much effort. The construction units also believe that the engineering units "are not fully occupied" this year, and the tasks can be completed earlier or later, so they are not actively helping the engineering units create construction conditions. The Baotou First, Second, and Third Engineering Companies only signed construction contracts with twenty-eight construction units by June. However, this year's plan is to contract out construction tasks to these three engineering companies from one hundred and thirty construction units. After the start of the rectification campaign, some units relaxed their leadership over basic construction work even more. For example, the North China Baotou Engineering Corporation was originally the best-performing construction unit in Baotou this year, completing its plan in the first five months, but after the rectification campaign began in June, the task was not completed.
    The Baotou leadership has now decided to take the following measures to reverse the slow progress of basic construction projects:
    (1) In conjunction with conveying the spirit of the National Design Conference, conduct a general and profound education on "building the country diligently and thriftily" among the workers. Leaders at all levels must take action themselves, go deep down, and thoroughly inspect the current construction situation and the preparations for welcoming the construction upsurge, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.
    (2) Construction units and engineering units should cooperate closely to overcome the current situation of slow project progress. Design projects that are urgently needed for construction should not be changed unless they involve significant waste; standard drawings should be used as much as possible for civil buildings; any wrangling that is unfavorable to construction should be resolved promptly by leaders through consultation; both parties should establish a certain system to strengthen communication.
  　(3) In terms of building materials, all units should resolutely overcome departmentalism, share resources, and make mutual adjustments.

    骄傲使人落后
    领导方面已采取措施  努力弥补失去的时间
    包头许多基本建设单位的领导人觉得“今年力量大、任务小，不用费劲也能完成”，于是松松懈懈，拖拖沓沓，结果上半年只完成全年基本建设计划的25％，造成了“春天窝工、秋天赶工、冬天抢工”的浪费、被动局面。
    本报特约新华社包头27日电  包头许多基本建设单位的领导人员对待今年的基本建设计划有松劲情绪。这种思想情绪所带来的后果是：今年包头市基本建设计划上半年只完成了25％。“春季窝工，秋季赶工，冬季抢工”已成定局。
    今年上半年包头市基本建设计划完成得不好，虽然有一些客观原因，如计划确定得比1956年晚三个月左右；设计多变，赶不上施工。但是，最主要的原因是基本建设单位领导人员有松劲情绪。市的有关领导机关和建筑、施工单位的许多领导人员都认为，今年施工力量大，任务小，不用费劲也可以完成。建设单位也认为，今年施工单位“吃不饱”，任务提早提迟都可以完成，因而不积极帮助施工单位创造施工条件。包头市第一、第二、第三工程公司，到6月份才只同二十八个建设单位订了施工合同；但是，今年计划把施工任务包给这三个工程公司的建设单位，有一百三十个。整风运动开始以后，有些单位更加放松了对基本建设工作的领导。例如，华北包头工程总公司原是今年包头市施工单位中完成计划最好的一个，1至5月份都完成了计划，但在6月份开展整风运动以后，任务反而没有完成。
    包头市领导方面现在已经决定采取以下措施，来扭转基本建设工程进度迟缓的状况。
    （一）结合传达全国设计会议精神，在职工中进行一次普遍、深刻的“勤俭建国”的教育。各级领导人员都要亲自动手，深入下去，切实检查目前的施工情况和迎接施工高潮的准备工作，发现问题，及时解决。
    （二）建设单位和施工单位应密切合作，共同克服目前工程进度迟缓的状况。急等施工的设计项目，只要不是浪费很大就不再改变；民用建筑尽量采用标准图纸；凡对施工不利的扯皮事情，应由领导人员出面及时协商解决；双方应建立一定制度，加强联系。
  　（三）在建筑材料方面，各单位应坚决克服本位主义，互通有无，互相调剂。
