    Oman Office in Cairo Says
    Oman Uprising Seeks Independence
    Britain Deploys Troops to Suppress It; United States Closely Watching
    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from Cairo: The Oman Office in Cairo issued a communique on the 21st stating that the Omani people's uprising is a "liberation revolution seeking independence."
    The communique stated that Oman's independence was officially recognized before 1955. In 1955, the Sultan of Muscat's troops, under the protection of imperialist forces, attacked this territory.
    The communique said: "The Omani liberals, who have declared war on British imperialism and its agents, recognize that only revolution can guarantee their freedom, and they are willing to exchange their lives for independence."
    On the same day, Mohammed al-Kharsah, the Imam of Oman's representative in Cairo, said that 20% of the British-backed Sultan of Muscat's army were British, and the Sultan's troops in the Oman region were stationed in seven military centers, with British officers.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch from London: Britain is dispatching troops to Shayqa in Oman, preparing to suppress the armed uprising of tribal people in the Nizwa region of Oman.
    A company of British troops has already been transferred from Bahrain to Shayqa. Some British troops currently in Kenya are said to be airlifted there to join them. Venom jet fighters based in Aden have been deployed to Shayqa. Two British warships are on standby off the northeast coast of Oman.
    A British Foreign Office spokesman said on July 21 that the government is monitoring the development of the situation in Oman day and night. It is reported that British figures believe that Saudi Arabia, which is leaning towards the United States, wants to use the current events in Oman to force Britain to make concessions on the Buraimi Oasis dispute. The United States supports Saudi Arabia in this dispute. For several years, US and British oil monopolies have been vying for the oil deposits in the Buraimi Oasis.
    News from Washington states that the US State Department is also closely watching the situation in Oman. According to Reuters, US State Department officials said they hoped to use the events unfolding in Oman to bring up the Buraimi Oasis issue, which is being disputed between Britain and Saudi Arabia. On this issue, Britain has repeatedly refused to negotiate with Saudi Arabia.

    阿曼驻开罗办事处说
    阿曼起义是谋求独立
    英国调兵镇压　美国密切注视
    据新华社22日讯　开罗消息：阿曼驻开罗办事处21日发表公报说，阿曼人民的起义是“谋求独立的解放革命”。
    公报说，阿曼的独立在1955年以前是受到正式承认的，1955年，马斯喀特苏丹的部队在帝国主义势力的庇护下进攻了这片领土。
    公报说：“已经向英帝国主义和它的代理人宣战的阿曼自由主义者认识到，只有革命才能保证他们的自由，他们愿意以他们的生命来换取独立。”
    同一天，阿曼教长驻开罗的代表穆罕默德·哈尔赛说，英国支持的马斯喀特苏丹的军队有20％是英国人，苏丹在阿曼地区的军队分驻在七个军事中心，军官都是英国人。
    据新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：英国正在调派军队去阿曼的沙雅，准备前去镇压阿曼尼兹瓦地区的部落人民武装起义。
    一连英国军队已经由巴林开往沙雅。目前在怯尼亚的一些英国军队据说也将空运到那里来会合。以亚丁为基地的英国毒液式喷气战斗机已经被派到沙雅。两艘英国军舰正在阿曼东北部沿海待命。
    英国外交部发言人7月21日说，政府正在日夜注视阿曼局势的发展。据报道，英国人士认为，靠拢美国的沙特阿拉伯要利用阿曼目前事件，来迫使英国在布赖米绿洲争执上让步。美国在这个争执上是支持沙特阿拉伯的。几年来，美英石油垄断资本一直在争夺着布赖米绿洲的石油矿藏。
    华盛顿的消息说，美国国务院也在密切注视阿曼的形势。据路透社报道，美国国务院官员说，他们希望通过阿曼爆发的事件把英国和沙特阿拉伯争执着的布赖米绿洲问题重新提出来。在这个问题上，英国曾一再拒绝跟沙特阿拉伯进行谈判。
