Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 26th -- The Democratic Parties Congress convened by Maulana Bhashani in Dhaka announced on the 25th its decision to organize a new party on an all-Pakistan basis, to be named the National People's Party.

    The congress opened on the 25th. All attendees unanimously passed a resolution on the same day stating that the new party will strive to unify the people of Pakistan into a strong, independent nation free from imperialist constraints.

    The congress appointed a committee of fifty-five members to take steps in this direction. The committee is chaired by Maulana Bhashani.

    This proposal, which was originally intended to be submitted later, was presented to the congress at the end of the morning session. According to the organizers of the congress, this was because they feared that the meeting might be forced to be interrupted due to the enforcement of Article 144 as a result of any unfortunate incident. Article 144 prohibits all public gatherings. Shortly after the start of the congress, a group of demonstrators shouting slogans against Bhashani blocked the entrance to an old cinema being used as the venue. The demonstrators prevented National Party leader Mian Iftikharuddin from entering the venue and injured him. The driver was also injured and the car was destroyed.

    National Party leader Wu Mu Said, speaking at the congress about the demonstration, accused the use of such fascist tactics. He believes that the ruling party wants to find an excuse to implement Article 144 in order to obstruct the congress.

    Maulana Bhashani made a long speech at the meeting. He condemned the Awami League government for failing to solve the various problems facing the country, including the food problem and the flood problem. He also attacked the leaders of the Awami League for forgetting the promises they made to the people in the elections.

    Speaking of foreign policy, Bhashani said that the central government of the Awami League recognized the foreign treaties and alliances concluded by the Muslim League, thereby increasing the danger to our sovereignty. He said that the United States and Britain have always been hostile to Muslim interests.

    He is not opposed to accepting economic aid. But he asked: "Who can give an example to show that conditional dollar aid from the United States has helped the development of any country?"

    He added: "We have been receiving economic aid from the United States since 1954, but our economic situation is still deteriorating. The people are living half-starved and half-fed, without food and clothing."

    He said that the military alliance between Pakistan and the United States "is undermining the country's economic and political independence." He expressed regret that although the Awami League opposed this military alliance, Suhrawardy "began to deliberately break the above promises within a few days of his rule, and openly praised the policies formulated by the Muslim League."

    Many leaders from East Pakistan and West Pakistan spoke at the meeting, expressing full support for the congress. Nearly a thousand delegates from various regions of East Pakistan and about eighty delegates from West Pakistan attended the congress. This is the first time that so many political leaders and political workers from East and West Pakistan have gathered together to discuss some of the problems facing Pakistan.

### 巴基斯坦民主党派代表大会  决定成立民族人民党  促使国家不受帝国主义约束

    巴基斯坦民主党派代表大会
    决定成立民族人民党
    促使国家不受帝国主义约束
    新华社卡拉奇26日电　由大毛拉巴沙尼在达卡召集的民主党派代表大会25日宣布，它决定在全巴基斯坦的基础上组织一个新政党，并且定名为民族人民党。
    大会是在25日开幕的。全体到会者在当天一致通过决议说，这个新政党将努力使巴基斯坦人民统一为一个不受帝国主义约束的强大的独立国家。
    大会任命了一个由五十五个委员组成的委员会来在这方面采取步骤。委员会由大毛拉巴沙尼担任主席。
    这项本来打算在以后提出的提案，是在上午会议结束时向大会提出的。据大会组织者说，这是因为他们担心可能由于发生任何不幸事件而会实行第一百四十四条法令使会议被迫中断。第一百四十四条法令禁止一切公众集会。在大会开始以后不久，一群喊着反对巴沙尼的口号的示威者堵住了作为会场的一家古老的电影院的入口处。示威者阻止民族党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁进入会场，并且把他打伤了。司机也被打伤，汽车被捣毁。
    民族党领袖吴·穆·赛义德在大会上谈到示威时，指责使用这种法西斯手段。他认为，执政党为了阻挠大会的进行想寻找借口实行第一百四十四条法令。
    大毛拉巴沙尼在会上作了长篇发言。他谴责人民联盟政府未能解决这个国家所面临的各种问题，其中包括粮食问题和水灾问题。他还攻击人民联盟的领袖们忘记了他们在选举中对人民所作的诺言。
    巴沙尼谈到外交政策时说，人民联盟的中央政府承认了穆斯林联盟所缔结的外国条约和联盟，从而增加了对我们主权的危险。他说，美国和英国一向是敌视穆斯林利益的。
    他不反对接受经济援助。但是他问道：“什么人能举个例子说明美国的有条件的美元援助帮助了任何一个国家的发展？”
    他又说：“我们从1954年起一直接受美国的经济援助，但是，我们的经济情况仍然在恶化中。人民正在半饥半饱、无食无衣中度日。”
    他说，巴基斯坦和美国的军事联盟“正在破坏国家的经济上和政治上的独立”。他表示遗憾的是，尽管人民联盟反对这一军事联盟，苏拉瓦底却“在他执政的几天之内开始执意地破坏上述诺言，并公开赞扬穆斯林联盟所制定的政策。”
    来自东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦的许多领袖在会上发言表示完全支持大会。出席大会的有来自东巴基斯坦各个地区的近一千名代表和来自西巴基斯坦的约八十名代表。这是第一次有这么多来自东西巴基斯坦的政治领袖和政治工作者聚在一起讨论巴基斯坦所面临着的一些问题。
