    Notice on Strengthening the Management of the Cotton Cloth Market
    The Central Administration of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently jointly issued a notice on strictly prohibiting the buying and selling of cloth coupons and strengthening the management of the native cloth market. The notice stated that in many areas, small vendors are illegally buying and selling cloth coupons to purchase cotton cloth at inflated prices for resale. Private vendors are actively transporting and selling native cloth without coupons at high prices. Furthermore, free markets have been discovered in various places where cotton cloth and cloth products are sold without requiring cloth coupons.
    The notice pointed out that cotton cloth is a commodity subject to state monopoly purchase and sales, and the above-mentioned situations affect the implementation of state policy. For this reason, local industrial and commercial administrative departments and relevant units are required to pay attention to the following two points:
    (1) Strictly prohibit the buying and selling of cloth coupons and speculative activities such as raising prices and purchasing cotton cloth and cloth products through improper means. Except for state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private commercial enterprises, as well as licensed small vendors who should supply goods according to regulations with proper documentation, no other vendors are allowed to deal in cotton cloth and cloth products.
    (2) If there is native cloth trading in free markets, management should be strengthened. In addition to allowing small-scale exchanges between producers and consumers, the remaining portion of the native cloth on the market should be purchased by local state-owned companies or supply and marketing cooperatives, and supplied to the market with coupons. The native cloth purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives, in addition to being sold locally, the remaining portion should be regulated to other regions by state-owned companies; vendors are prohibited from transporting and selling it.

    加强棉布市场管理的通知
    中央工商行政管理局、商业部、全国供销合作总社最近联合发出关于严格禁止买卖布票和加强土布市场管理的通知。通知说，目前不少地区小商贩有买卖布票套购棉布高价出售的违法现象；私营商贩贩运土布免票高价出售的情况很活跃；各地还发现贩卖棉布及布制品不收布票的自由市场。
    通知指出，棉布是国家统购统销商品，上述情况影响了国家政策的贯彻。为此要求各地工商行政部门及有关单位注意以下两点：
    （一）严格禁止布票买卖和对棉布与布制品的抬价套购投机；除国营、合作社、公私合营商业以及有执照小商贩应按规定凭证供应外，其他任何商贩不得捣卖棉布及布制品。
    （二）自由市场上如有土布交易，应加强管理。上市土布除允许生产与消费者可小量互通有无外，其余部分应由当地国营公司或供销社负责收购，凭票供应市场。供销社收购的土布，除当地销售外，其剩余部分统由国营公司负责调剂外区，禁止商贩贩运。
