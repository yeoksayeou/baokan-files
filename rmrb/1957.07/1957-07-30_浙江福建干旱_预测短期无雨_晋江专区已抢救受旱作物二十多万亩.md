Zhejiang and Fujian Drought; Short-Term Forecast of No Rain
    Jinjiang Prefecture Rescues More Than 200,000 Mu of Drought-Stricken Crops
    30,000 People Participate in Drought Resistance in Changxing County, Zhejiang Every Day
    (Report from this newspaper) According to statistics from the Zhejiang Provincial Flood and Drought Control Headquarters, as of July 4th, more than 3.35 million mu of farmland in the province had been affected by drought. Prediction: Due to the control of the Pacific high pressure, it will be difficult to have substantial rainfall in the short term, and the drought situation will continue to develop. Currently, it is also the water requirement period for middle rice heading and grouting, and late rice and late autumn crops transplanting and sowing.
    The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee jointly issued an instruction on the 26th, requiring all farmers in the province to urgently mobilize and fully prevent and combat drought to ensure a bumper harvest. The instruction stated that leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government and all staff must recognize the serious threat of this year's drought and must take the urgent harvesting, planting, and drought prevention as the overriding central tasks in rural areas. The instruction also put forward five specific requirements: (1) Actively store water, conserve water, develop water sources, and save water, and give full play to the role of various water-lifting tools; (2) Take various measures to fight drought, rush to plant, and protect seedlings; (3) Unify the arrangement of labor and reasonably solve labor remuneration to give full play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members; (4) Actively resolve water conservancy disputes, prevent superstitious activities, and be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries spreading rumors and sabotaging; (5) Party and government organs at all levels, people's organizations, and economic enterprises should urgently mobilize to assist in drought resistance.
    At present, the struggle against drought in Jiaxing Prefecture has been widely launched. In Changxing County alone, 30,000 people participate in drought resistance every day, and 150 water pumps and thousands of waterwheels rotate day and night to irrigate water. The Zhuji County Party Committee has transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead the masses in drought resistance and rush harvesting and planting. Farmers in Sidu Township, Jiangshan County, also put forward the slogan "Resist one mu is one mu, resist one fen is one fen," expressing their determination to fight the drought.
    (Report from this newspaper) According to the Fujian Daily, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee recently issued an emergency notice instructing all localities to strengthen leadership in drought resistance and prevention.
    The notice explained that the current drought situation in the province is extremely serious, and pointed out that this year's grain production increase mainly relies on autumn crops. Therefore, it is required that areas where drought has occurred should actively mobilize the masses, focusing on drought resistance and seedling protection; areas where drought has not occurred should prepare for drought resistance. Leading organs at all levels should also transfer cadres to the countryside to lead drought resistance based on the drought situation, especially agriculture, water conservancy, health, and economic departments should provide specific guidance and assistance to the drought resistance struggle.
    Jinjiang Prefecture in Fujian Province is currently carrying out activities for drought resistance and prevention, and has rescued more than 270,000 mu of drought-stricken crops. According to statistics from Nan'an, Fuqing, and Putian counties, more than 154,000 people participate in drought resistance every day, and tens of thousands of waterwheels, buckets, and scoops irrigate the fields day and night.

    浙江福建干旱　预测短期无雨
    晋江专区已抢救受旱作物二十多万亩
    浙江长兴县每天有三万人参加抗旱
    本报讯　据浙江省防汛防旱指挥部统计，至7月4日止，全省有三百三十五万多亩农田受旱。预测：由于受太平洋高气压的控制，短期内很难大量降雨，旱情势将继续发展。而目前又正是中稻抽穗灌浆、晚稻和晚秋作物插秧下种需水时期。
    中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会于26日发出联合指示，要求全省农民紧急动员起来，全力防旱抗旱保证农业丰收。指示说，各级党政领导干部和全体工作人员必须认清今年干旱的严重威胁，要把抢收抢种和防旱抗旱作为当前农村压倒一切的中心任务。指示还提出了五项具体要求：（一）要积极蓄水、保水、开辟水源和节约用水，充分发挥各种戽水工具的作用；（二）采取各种措施，抗旱抢种保苗；（三）统一安排劳动力，合理解决劳动报酬，以发挥广大社员的积极性；（四）主动解决水利纠纷，防止迷信活动，警惕反革命分子造谣破坏；（五）各级党政机关、人民团体以及经济企业单位紧急动员起来协助抗旱。
    目前，嘉兴专区抗旱斗争已普遍展开。仅长兴县每天有三万人参加抗旱，一百五十台抽水机和几千架水车日夜转动灌水。诸暨县委已抽调大批干部下乡领导群众抗旱和进行抢收抢种。江山县四都乡农民还提出了“抗一亩是一亩，抗一分是一分”的响亮口号，表示与干旱进行坚决的斗争。
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：中共福建省委最近发出紧急通知，指示各地加强抗旱、防旱的领导。
    通知说明了目前全省旱情极为严重，并指出今年粮食的增产任务又主要依靠秋季作物。因此，要求已发生旱情地区要积极发动群众，以抗旱保苗为中心；尚未发生旱情地区要作好抗旱的准备工作。各级领导机关还要根据旱情抽调干部下乡领导抗旱，特别是农业、水利、卫生和经济部门要具体指导和协助抗旱斗争。
    福建晋江专区目前普遍开展抗旱防旱的活动，已抢救受旱作物有二十七万多亩。据南安、福清、莆田三县统计，每天参加抗旱的有十五万四千多人，数以万计的水车、吊桶、戽桶日夜灌田。
