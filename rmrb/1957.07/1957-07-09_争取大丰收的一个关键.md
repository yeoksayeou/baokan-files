A Key to Strive for a Bumper Harvest

Whether or not a bumper agricultural harvest can be achieved this year is closely related to the quality of field management in the next two to three months.

In many regions this year, wheat yields have not reached planned targets due to uneven rainfall. Therefore, to complete the annual grain production plan, efforts must be made to increase the production of autumn grains. At the same time, to complete this year's production plans for cotton and certain oilseed crops and cash crops, we must do our utmost to cultivate these crops well and strive for a significant increase in their yields per unit area.

As the saying goes, "Planting depends on the plow, harvesting depends on the hoe." Since the implementation of cooperativization, Chinese farmers have gained many new experiences in strengthening summer field management. Under the leadership of the CPC Xin Zhou County Committee in Hubei Province, 100,000 mu of cotton fields were top-dressed with foliar fertilizer (phosphate fertilizer) once to four times last year, over 80,000 mu of cotton fields underwent topping and pruning, and more than 20,000 people launched a large-scale pest control campaign. The agricultural cooperatives in various townships applied more fertilizer, weeded more diligently, and intensified pest control, which helped many weak cotton seedlings grow strong. In the later stages of cotton field management, the townships universally launched a "three guarantees" campaign to "guarantee buds, guarantee flowers, and guarantee bolls." This series of efforts ensured a bumper harvest of 65 jin of ginned cotton per mu on 277,700 mu of cotton fields throughout the county. In Shan County and Lingbao County in Henan Province, well-known cotton-producing areas, large-scale cotton harvests were also achieved last year due to the promotion of early and mid-cultivation, early fertilization, fine pruning, and pest and disease control in field management and other aspects. In Jingxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, the promotion of artificial detasseling and pollination of corn and other advanced production experiences last year resulted in an average yield of 325 jin per mu for over 340,000 mu of early corn, an increase of 53% compared to 1955.

From these facts, it can be seen that as long as field management is strengthened, there is hope for increased agricultural production. In the past, some areas either relaxed leadership over field management due to emergency disaster relief, flood prevention, or road construction work, or, in the process of implementing technical measures, focused too much on aspects such as land preparation, sowing, fertilization, and close planting, while neglecting to grasp the crucial link of field management in summer production, resulting in significant losses in agricultural production. In 1956, varying degrees of seedling shortages occurred in several regions of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Northeast China. This mistake must be avoided this year.

At present, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have a common demand: to promptly organize forces to carry out field management work. Taking mid-season cultivation and weeding as an example, because major autumn crops are constantly fighting weeds throughout their growth and development, it is difficult for crops to defeat weeds if they are not properly nurtured in a timely manner. If topdressing, irrigation, and pest and disease control are not carried out in a timely manner, it will certainly be difficult to achieve the desired results. Field management not only requires timeliness but also good quality. For example, thinning and setting seedlings need to be meticulous, and mid-season cultivation, weeding, and pest and disease control need to be clean and thorough, and cannot simply focus on speed and superficiality. Every agricultural cooperative should educate its members to pay close attention to these two points.

This year, because of the low temperatures in the spring in northern regions, the sowing period for spring-sown crops was delayed compared to ordinary years, and the growth and development of seedlings are slow, which makes field management work even more arduous. In the south, intermediate rice, which has a large planting area, is not growing well due to late transplanting. Double-season late rice requires immediate transplanting of seedlings after the early rice harvest, and field management must follow up. Some provinces expanded their wheat fields last winter, and the area of replanting has also increased accordingly this year. The Northeast region has expanded a lot of paddy fields this year, and the amount of labor required in the summer will also increase, while animal power is relatively scarce. These are the practical difficulties in this year's summer field management, and we must try every possible means to overcome them.

This year, most agricultural cooperatives in various regions are implementing the "three guarantees" method of contracting for work, output, and costs, which is a favorable condition for strengthening field management. However, this does not mean that there are no problems in field management. Some cooperatives have not set reasonable labor quotas for summer weeding. In these cooperatives, production teams are often afraid of exceeding the quota for labor and reduce the work points of members, or even reduce the operation procedures and ignore the operation quality. Members are also competing to do light work because they are afraid of earning fewer work points. In order to solve these contradictions and ensure good field management, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should check and adjust the contracted work quotas at any time. At the same time, some flexible methods can be adopted in addition to contracting work to adapt to new situations in field management. For example, if the number of workdays for pest control is not specified in the contracted work, temporary forces should be organized to control pests when pests occur, and reasonable work points should be temporarily stipulated. This year, some cooperatives have increased the members' private plots. In this tense summer production season, the cooperative's fields are in urgent need of labor, and the members' private plots also need to be cultivated, which easily leads to a conflict between the collective fields and the members' private plots competing for labor. Only by helping the cooperative to take into account the overall situation and make proper arrangements can losses be avoided.

To do a good job in the intense summer field management, it is necessary to give full play to the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of members and improve labor efficiency. In this regard, in addition to conducting in-depth ideological education for the members and strengthening labor discipline, it is necessary to effectively organize and arrange the labor force. The most important thing here is to formulate detailed and feasible labor plans and small-section labor plans. This labor plan should include labor for the cooperative's fields, labor for the members' private plots, necessary sideline labor, basic construction, and disaster relief labor, so as to take care of both the collective agricultural production of the cooperative and the sideline production and personal production of the members, and not to relax field management due to sudden attacks of natural disasters.

Strengthening summer field management is a key to striving for a bumper harvest this year. Time is running out, comrades working in rural areas across the country, comrades of agricultural cooperatives across the country, get to work quickly!

### 争取大丰收的一个关键

    争取大丰收的一个关键
    今年农业大丰收能不能实现，同今后两三个月的田间管理工作的好坏有密切关系。
    今年有不少地区由于雨水不调匀，小麦产量没有达到原定计划。因此，要完成全年粮食生产计划，就需要力争秋粮的增产。同时，要完成今年棉花和某些油料作物、经济作物的生产计划，也必须竭尽全力把这些庄稼培育好，争取它们的单位面积产量有较大的提高。
    农谚说得好：“种在犁上，收在锄上。”我国农民在实行合作化以后，在加强夏季的田间管理方面已经有了许多新的经验。湖北省新洲县在中共县委的领导下，去年有十万亩棉田进行了一次到四次的根外追肥（磷肥），有八万多亩棉田进行了摘心整枝，有两万多人开展了大规模的防治虫害运动。各乡农业社多施肥料、多薅草和加紧防治虫害的办法，促使许多瘦弱的棉苗茁壮起来。在棉田后期管理上，各乡普遍开展了“保蕾、保花、保桃”的“三保”运动。这一系列的努力，保证了全县二十七万七千多亩棉田亩产六十五斤皮棉的大丰收。河南省著名棉区陕县、灵宝县等地，去年由于在田间管理和其他方面推广了早中耕、早施肥、精细整枝和防治病虫害等措施，也获得了棉花的大面积丰收。广西省桂西僮族自治州靖西县推广了玉米人工去雄授粉和其他先进生产经验，去年全县三十四万多亩早玉米每亩平均产量达到三百二十五斤，比1955年增加53％。
    从这些事实中，可以看到，只要加强田间管理，农业的增产就有希望。过去有些地区或者因为突击抗灾、防汛、修路等工作而放松对田间管理的领导，或者因为在推行技术措施当中偏重于整地、播种、施肥、密植等方面，而不注意抓住田间管理这个夏季生产的关键性环节，使农业生产遭受不小的损失。1956年，河北、山东、河南、江苏和东北的若干地区，都发生过不同程度的苗荒现象。这个错误，今年必须竭力避免。
    各地农业社目前有一个共同的要求，就是要及时地组织力量进行田间管理工作。拿中耕锄草来说，因为大秋作物在整个生长发育期中，无时不在与杂草作斗争，如果不及时加以很好的培育，庄稼是很难战胜杂草的。追肥、灌溉、防治病虫害等工作如果不及时进行，当然也很难收到预期的效果。田间管理不但要求及时，而且要求质量好。比如间苗定苗需要细致，中耕锄草、防治病虫害需要干净彻底，不能光是图快，图表面。这两点，每一个农业合作社都应该教育自己的社员切实加以注意。
    今年北方地区因为春季气温低，春播作物的播种期较一般年份延迟了时间，庄稼苗生长发育缓慢，这就使得田间管理的工作更加艰巨。在南方，种植面积很大的中稻，因为插秧较迟，生长情况也不太好。双季晚稻在早稻收了以后立即移栽秧苗，田间管理就得跟上去。有的省去冬扩大了麦田，今年复种面积也相应地增加。东北地区今年扩大了很多稻田，夏季的用工量也要增加，而畜力却相对地缺乏。这些都是今年夏季田间管理中的实际困难，必须想尽千方百计加以克服。
    今年各地多数农业社实行包工、包产、包成本的“三包”办法，这是加强田间管理的一个有利条件。但这并不是说，在田间管理中就没有问题了。有些合作社的夏锄用工定额订得不够合理。在这些合作社中，生产队往往怕用工超出定额，而压缩社员的工分，甚至减少作业程序，忽视作业质量。社员因为怕少挣工分，也争作轻活。为了解决这些矛盾，保证做好田间管理，各地农业合作社应该随时检查和调整包工定额。同时在包工之外还可以采取一些机动办法，以适应田间管理中发生的新情况。比如包工中如果没有规定治虫用工数，遇有虫害发生就应该临时组织力量治虫，临时规定合理的工分。今年有些合作社增加了社员自留地，在这个生产紧张的夏季，社里的田地急需劳力，社员的自留地也需要加工，这就容易发生大片田地和社员自留地争工的矛盾。只有帮助合作社统筹兼顾，妥善安排，才能避免损失。
    要做好紧张的夏季田间管理，必须发挥广大社员的劳动积极性，提高劳动效率。在这方面，除了要向社员深入地进行思想教育，加强劳动纪律以外，必须切实做好劳动力的组织和安排。这里最重要的是制定周密的、切实可行的用工计划和小段用工计划。这种用工计划要包括社里田地用工、社员自留地用工、必要的副业用工、基本建设以及抗灾用工，这样才能既照顾到社的集体的农业生产，也照顾到副业生产和社员个人生产，而且不至于因为应付自然灾害的突然袭击，而放松了田间管理。
    加强夏季的田间管理是争取今年大丰收的一个关键。时间不多了，全国农村工作的同志们，全国农业合作社的同志们，赶快动手干啊！
