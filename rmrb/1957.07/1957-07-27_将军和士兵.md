    The manager's cap doesn't have a military emblem,
    The manager's shoulders don't have gold stars,
    But whenever he comes to the construction site,
    The construction workers still call him General.
    Once the manager jokingly pouted,
    Pointing to his work permit to declare to everyone:
    "The motherland changed my profession long ago,
    You all are no longer soldiers!"
    A cement worker came before the manager,
    Holding his mixing rod in a salute like a rifle:
    "Construction and fighting are the same,
    We are still soldiers of the motherland!"
    The "General" and the "soldiers",
    Were all said to burst into loud laughter,
    Causing the shining military medals,
    To chime incessantly on their chests.

    将军和士兵
    权正
    经理帽上没有军徽，
    经理肩上没有金星，
    可是，每当他来到工地，
    建筑工人们仍然叫他将军。
    有一次经理假意鼓起嘴，
    指着工作证向大伙申明：
    “祖国早把我改了行，
    你们也早已不是士兵！”
    水泥工来到经理面前，
    拿着搅杆行持枪礼：
    “建设和战斗都是一个样，
    我们仍然是祖国的士兵！”
    “将军”和“士兵”们，
    都被说得纵声大笑，
    引起闪亮的军功章，
    在他们胸前叮当不停。
