    Chu Anping Makes Confession at Jiusan Society Symposium
    "Party Rule" Speech Was Discussed with Luo Longji

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Central Committee of the Jiusan Society continued to hold a rectification symposium last night, demanding that Chu Anping honestly confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance. Chu Anping confessed some of his relationships with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, saying that the content of his "Party Rule" speech had been discussed with Luo Longji and was put forward under his influence and support. He also said that in the past few days, he had held the attitude of "taking responsibility for the mistakes himself and not wanting to push them on others," but now he wanted to clarify this issue.

    In his confession, Chu Anping first talked about his historical relationship with Luo Longji. He said that he and Luo Longji had known each other for a long time, but their relationship was not good. Then, he talked about his situation after working at the Guangming Daily. He said, on April 16, I went to work at the "Guangming Daily." I felt that since the "Guangming Daily" was a newspaper of the democratic parties, I had seen some comrades in charge of publicity for the democratic parties. On May 19, I saw Luo Longji once, arriving at 9:45 am and leaving at 11:00 am, which was the first time I had seen him in twenty years. The main purpose of my visit was to talk about how the "Guangming Daily" could get more help from the democratic parties. Chu Anping said that he and Luo Longji talked about the issue of reforming the "Guangming Daily" layout and adjusting the news. He asked me: Is there a management organization? I said: There is a social affairs committee, composed of various democratic parties, which is the highest authority, and major policies are decided by it. However, it has not yet been convened. Zhang Bojun originally scheduled it to be held on May 5, but it was delayed. In addition, we talked about the issues at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. I said that Zhang Bojun had mentioned organizing an "advisory group" for the "Guangming Daily." Luo Longji thought this was a good idea. He said: Zhang Bojun's strength is his boldness, but his shortcoming is that he is careless. I am afraid relying on him won't work, you still have to rely on yourself. I said: I am not enough, I need to rely on the publicity departments of the democratic parties and have more comrades engaged in editing write articles. He said: Very good.

    Chu Anping also said that he and Luo Longji also talked about the principles of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thoughts contend," and how to embody them in the Guangming Daily. Chu Anping said that Luo Longji said that he could give some opinions to the "old monks." Chu Anping said, I was influenced by his words. Chu Anping also said that Luo Longji told him that he hoped everyone would give some opinions to Chairman Mao. Chu Anping said that he did not send his speech draft to him. I should take responsibility for the mistakes myself, but I was influenced by him. When he talked about this issue, I immediately thought about the issue that none of the twelve vice premiers of the State Council were non-Party members. And asked him if it could be raised. He said: It can be raised. This also had an impact on my speech. Because it is not easy to give opinions to Chairman Mao, I raised the opinion about the twelve vice premiers.

    Chu Anping said, I also asked him, what is the content of this "People's Congress"? He said: It is estimated that the "People's Congress" will discuss the political system. And he thought that it might be discussed for some time. Because talking about the "People's Congress" also honestly exposed my thoughts, that is, I saw some shortcomings in the "anti-espionage" work in the newspapers. I wondered if this issue could be jointly inspected by the Standing Committee of the "People's Congress" and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; at the same time, the anti-espionage targets who were wrongly criticized could also directly write to the Standing Committee of the "People's Congress" for inspection. I also wanted to speak at the "People's Congress" meeting, and talk about this issue in my speech. I told Luo Longji that if the "People's Congress" meeting was held, I would talk about this issue. Luo Longji said: You can talk about it. However, he also said: The preamble to the constitution can also be discussed. He said: For example, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was completed ahead of schedule, which was not estimated before the constitution was formulated, which shows that the constitution is different from the current situation. I am interested in the issue of personal freedom, and he is interested in talking about the preamble to the constitution. Does his intention to talk about the preamble to the constitution mean that he intends to amend the constitution?

    Finally, I said: There are no conditions for this yet. The newspaper office is very weak in manpower and has few people. Luo Longji immediately said: Chen Xingui has twice requested to work at the "Guangming Daily." I asked, has Chen Xingui done news work before? He said: Chen Xingui and he ran the "Democracy Daily" in Sichuan, and his theory is high among the cadres of the China Democratic League.

    储安平在九三学社座谈会上进行交代
    “党天下”的发言是先和罗隆基商谈过
    本报讯　九三学社中央于昨天晚上继续举行整风座谈会，要求储安平老老实实地交代他同章、罗联盟的关系。储安平交代了一些他和章伯钧、罗隆基的关系，说他的“党天下”的发言内容是和罗隆基商量过的，是在他的影响和支持下提出的。他还说，他前几天还抱着这样的态度，“错误由自己负责，不愿推在别人身上”，现在表示要澄清这个问题。
    储安平在交代中首先讲到他和罗隆基在历史上的关系，他说他和罗隆基认识得很早，但关系并不好。接着，他谈到他到光明日报工作以后的情况。他说，4月16日，我到“光明日报”工作。我觉得“光明日报”既为民主党派的报纸，所以，看过各民主党派一些负责宣传的同志。5月19日，我看过罗隆基一次，去时上午九时三刻，出来时上午十一时，这是二十年来第一次去看他。我去看他的主要目的是谈谈“光明日报”如何得到民主党派更大的帮助。储安平说，我和他谈到改革“光明日报”版面问题和调整新闻问题。他问我：是否有管理机构？我说：有社务委员会，由各民主党派组成，它是最高权力机构，大政方针由它决定。不过，直至现在尚未召开。章伯钧原定5月5日召开，但又拖下去未开。另外，又说到中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上的问题，我说章伯钧讲过为“光明日报”组织“顾问团”这句话。罗隆基认为这个办法很好。他说：章伯钧长处是气魄大，短处是粗枝大叶，恐怕要靠他不行，还得靠你自己。我说：我不够，要依靠民主党派宣传部，搞编辑的同志多写文章。他说：很好。
    储安平又说，他还和罗隆基谈到了“长期共存、互相监督”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针，到底如何在光明日报上体现出来。储安平说，罗隆基说可以给“老和尚”提些意见。储安平说，我受他这话的影响。储安平又说，罗隆基告诉他，希望大家对毛主席提些意见。储安平说，我的发言稿没有送他看。错误应由我自己负责，但是受了他的影响。他讲到这个问题时，我立刻想到国务院十二个副总理没有一个党外人士的问题。并问他是否可以提。他说：可以提。这对我发言也有影响。因为对毛主席不容易提出意见，所以就提了有关十二个副总理的意见。
    储安平说，我又问他，此次“人大”内容如何？他说：估计“人大”会对政治制度进行讨论。并且认为可能要讨论一个时候。因为谈到“人大”，也老实暴露一下我的思想，就是我在报纸上看到关于“肃反”工作有些缺点。我想这个问题是否由“人大”常委会和全国政协联合起来检查一下；同时被斗错的肃反对象也可以直接函请“人大”常委会检查。我还想在“人大”开会发言，发言则谈谈这个问题。我向罗隆基讲如果“人大”开会，我就谈这个问题。罗隆基说：可以谈。不过，他又说：宪法的前言也可以谈。他说：比如资本主义工商业社会主义改造提前完成，在制定宪法前是没有估计到的，这就说明宪法与目前情况不同了。我对人身自由问题有兴趣，而他对谈宪法前言有兴趣。他要谈宪法前言问题，是否有修改宪法的意思呢？
    最后，我说：目前还没有这个条件，报馆人力甚弱，而且人少。罗隆基即说：陈新桂曾两次要求到“光明日报”工作。我问，陈新桂作过新闻工作否？他说：陈新桂曾在四川同他办过“民主报”，在民盟干部中，他的理论是高的。
