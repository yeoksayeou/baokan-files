    Mourning the Italian Famous Writer Malaparte
    Xiao San

    Our good friend, the famous Italian writer Curzio Malaparte, passed away in Rome on the 19th of this month at the age of fifty-nine. We feel very saddened!

    Malaparte came to China last October. As soon as he got off the plane, he expressed his strong interest in visiting China and his infinite admiration for China. He believed that the achievements made by People's China in just seven short years since its establishment were astonishing.

    What an enthusiastic and righteous person Malaparte was! Due to his rich knowledge and keen insight, and because he avidly read everything he could find about China—books, historical and geographical materials, classical and modern literature and art—before coming to China, he was no stranger to China. After attending the memorial meetings for Lu Xun and Sun Yat-sen, touring various parts of China, and staying for some time, Malaparte became the best friend who loved our country and people—in his own words, China was his second homeland (motherland), and he himself was already half Chinese.

    We expressed a warm welcome to this upright foreign friend!

    Malaparte strongly opposed the view of China held by his compatriot Marco Polo, who was the first to come to China, because Marco Polo once said that China was a barbaric country.

    On the contrary, Malaparte greatly praised the Chinese people's diligence, bravery, and simplicity. He talked about his best impressions of China not just once, nor just to one person. He often said that the Chinese people, men, women, old, and young, are the most lovable, and the Chinese are the noblest nation in the world.

    (After attending the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, he told people that the Chinese people cared very much about cultural life, which was rare in Europe.)

    After visiting the Lu Xun Memorial Hall, Malaparte wrote in the memorial book: "After the visit, my heart is very agitated (confused). I am dissatisfied with my previous work." After writing this, he reiterated to the people accompanying him his admiration for Lu Xun, believing that Lu Xun worked for the people all his life, and every work had profound meaning. Many other writers only pursue the beauty of words, but the content is meaningless. Although he himself had written some meaningful works in the past, they were far inferior to Lu Xun's works. He also said that he was very moved by Lu Xun's spirit of caring for young people. From this, we can also see the humility of this Italian writer.

    In 1931, Malaparte wrote a book against Hitler, which was the first anti-fascist book in Europe. For this, Mussolini imprisoned and exiled him for five years.

    During World War II, he wrote an article for "Time" magazine every week. He also wrote articles and correspondence for the Italian Communist Party's weekly "New Life."

    Malaparte had been to the Soviet Union and wrote many articles about the first socialist country. After the Hungarian incident, some intellectuals in the West wavered, and a counter-current of anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment arose in the capitalist world. It was at this time that Malaparte published his own words praising the Soviet Union.

    Malaparte's views on literature and art were quite insightful. He frankly criticized some of the dramas and films he saw in China. He suggested that our literary and art circles work harder to produce some works with international influence. He repeatedly suggested to us to make a film about the "Long March."

    After watching "The Blessing", Malaparte praised it greatly, saying that the content was good, the technique was high, and the protagonist Bai Yang also performed very well... but in some aspects of the director, it was still not mature enough. He was referring to the fact that the expression on Xiang Lin's wife's face when she was stimulated was too strong. He said that this technique of using facial expressions to express strong reactions was outdated...

    Malaparte held talks with the Chinese theater circles on some issues related to "Thunderstorm." He believed that the level of the actors was very high, comparable to that of the actors in Paris. The director's level was also very high. He was also surprised to see such a fully equipped theater in China. He said that our spoken drama is progressing very quickly, but foreigners do not know it, because we only introduce classical art to foreign countries, and rarely introduce new things. He suggested that we hold a theater festival once a year and invite famous foreign playwrights and actors to observe...

    Malaparte's own writing range is quite wide, writing essays, sketches, correspondence, novels, and scripts. He once wrote a book called "Biography of Lenin." A script he wrote, "Das Kapital," depicting Marx's life in London, was staged more than ninety times in Paris in 1949, despite various obstacles and opposition from the bourgeoisie.

    What moved Malaparte the most was China's prisons. Originally, when the Chinese art troupe performed in Italy, some ill-intentioned reporters in Italy wrote in the newspapers: "Don't show us Peking Opera, let us see China's prisons!" It was for this reason that Malaparte specifically visited Beijing's prisons. His first impression surprised him was that there were no iron bars, etc., in the prison, and it was very clean inside. Furthermore, prisoners could move around in the prison without restrictions. He said that the treatment of prisoners in Chinese prisons is truly humanitarian. He said that the general criminal law is suppression and punishment; but in China it is education. This is the biggest feature. Malaparte cited his own experience in prison, saying that ordinary prisons only allow prisoners to "get some air" for one hour a day, but he saw prisoners in Beijing prisons coming and going in the prison, and they could work, study, participate in sports, cultural activities, and so on. This situation does not exist in Europe and other countries. There, criminals are locked in their rooms all day long, and are often tortured. Therefore, he said, from here it is even more obvious that the relationship between people in China is dignified.

    He also said that the Chinese people respect their own labor, which can be seen from the preservation of ancient relics and places of interest. Here, the relationship between people is very kind and polite. He had been in China for many days and had traveled to many places, and had never seen people fighting, arguing, or scolding in the streets.

    On the eve of the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, Malaparte was honored to be received by Chairman Mao and had a long conversation. This made him so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He said that his minor illness that day was completely cured! Afterwards, he told everyone he met that Chairman Mao was a perfect person, very ordinary and very great. After the meeting, he wrote more than a dozen pages of correspondence and sent it to "Time" magazine. "New Life" and "Time" both telegraphed him, saying that they had received several articles he had written since arriving in China, and praised his writing as wonderful. (The title of the first article was: "From Moscow to Beijing", which was published in "New Life".)

    Malaparte toured various parts of China. In Chongqing, his old illness relapsed, and he returned to Beijing and was treated at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. When we went to visit him in the hospital, he always said that he wanted to stay in China and finish his book about China, which he had already written two hundred pages of. When he felt that he had to return to his country, he cried several times, and when he boarded the plane, he hugged and cried with the people who saw him off. ...

    After he returned to his country, the Italian government gave him a special bonus to commend his contribution to literature and journalism. After returning to Rome, he continued to receive medical treatment. People from all walks of life in Italy, including government ministers and his friends, and Comrade Togliatti, the leader of the Italian Communist Party, went to the hospital to visit him. When a government minister, who was also a lifelong friend of Malaparte, went to see him, he scolded the ministers for their ignorance of China and the current Italian government's execution of other countries' policies of not recognizing People's China... (It is said that he angrily told the visitor to "get out!").

    Malaparte deeply regretted that he was unable to complete his book about all aspects of Chinese life in China. But he said that he would definitely write it after returning home. We also earnestly hoped to read this book of great significance. But unfortunately, the disease finally took away such a great and glorious life. What a misfortune this is for Italy and for all of us! How can this not cause the same profound grief among the Chinese and Italian people?!

    Malaparte's famous works include: "Kaputt," "The Skin," and "Maledetti Toscani" (Note: The Italian language spoken by the Tuscans is considered the most beautiful).

    Writing this, I can't help but think: a foreign, non-Party intellectual did not stay in China for a long time, but loved everything about us so enthusiastically, loved our Party, our people, and socialist society, and became our best friend; everyone knows that today we have thousands and hundreds of such international friends all over the world, which will not be listed one by one here; but some of our bourgeois rightists, including so-called great intellectuals, were born in China, grew up in China, but blackened their conscience and wantonly slandered and cursed, opposed the leadership of our Party, opposed our people and socialism, standing before Malaparte's spirit, can you not feel ashamed to die???!!!

    哀悼意大利名作家马拉帕尔特
    萧三
    本月19日中国人民的好朋友，意大利著名作家枯尔秋·马拉帕尔特在罗马去世了，享年五十九岁，我们觉得非常哀恸！
    马拉帕尔特去年10月来到中国他一下飞机就表示他来中国访问的浓厚兴趣和对中国的无限景慕。他认为人民中国成立后只短短七年就取得了这样的成绩是惊人的。
    马拉帕尔特是一个多么热情和富有正义感的人呵！由于他的知识丰富，眼光锐敏；由于他在来到中国之前贪读了一切他所能找到的关于中国的书刊，历史和地理的、古典和现代文学艺术的，他对于中国已不陌生。在出席了鲁迅和孙中山纪念大会、游览了中国各地并逗留了一些日子之后，马拉帕尔特成了热爱我们国家和人民的最好的朋友——用他自己的话来说，中国是他的第二故乡（祖国），他自己已经是半个中国人了。
    我们对这位正直的外国的新的最好朋友曾经表示了热烈的欢迎！
    马拉帕尔特非常反对他本国第一个来到中国的前人马可波罗对中国的看法，因为马可波罗曾经说，中国是个野蛮的国家。
    相反，马拉帕尔特非常称赞中国人民的勤劳、勇敢、朴实。他不只一次也不只向一个人谈述他对于中国最好的印象。他经常说，中国人民男男女女老老少少都是最可爱的，中国人是世上最高尚的民族。
    （他出席了鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念大会之后对人说，中国人民很关心文化生活，这种情况在欧洲却是稀有的。）
    在参观了鲁迅纪念馆之后，马拉帕尔特在纪念册上写道：“参观后我心中非常激动（混乱）。我对自己以前的工作感到不满”。写好之后又对陪同去的人申述他对鲁迅的敬仰，认为鲁迅一生是为人民而工作，每一篇作品都有深刻的意义。许多别的作家只求文字美，而内容毫无意义。自己过去虽写了些较有意义的作品，但和鲁迅的作品相比则差的远。他又说，对鲁迅爱护青年的精神也很感动。从这也可见这位意大利作家的谦虚。
    1931年马拉帕尔特写了一本书反对希特勒，这是欧洲第一本反法西斯的书。墨索里尼为了这，监禁并放逐他五年。
    第二次世界大战期间他每星期都给“时代”周刊写一篇文章。他也为意大利共产党的周刊“新生活”写文章和通讯。
    马拉帕尔特去过苏联，写了许多关于第一个社会主义国家的文章。匈牙利事件后，西方某些知识分子中间曾发生动摇，资本主义世界滚起一股反苏反共的逆流。正在这个时候马拉帕尔特发表自己的赞美苏联的文字。
    马拉帕尔特对于文学艺术的见解是颇为高明的。他直率地批评在中国所看见的一些戏剧、电影。他建议我国文艺界多努力产生一些具有国际影响的作品。他几次向我们提议制出一部关于“长征”的影片。
    看了“祝福”之后马拉帕尔特大为称赞说，内容好，技术高，主角白扬也演的很好……但在导演的某些方面还嫌不大成熟。他说的是祥林嫂受到刺激时脸上的表情过于强烈，他说，用面部表情来表达强烈反应的这种技巧已经过时了……
    马拉帕尔特和我国戏剧界会谈有关“雷雨”的一些问题。他认为演员的水平很高，可和巴黎的演员相比。导演水平也很高。在中国能看见这样设备完全的剧院也使他惊奇。他说我们的话剧进步很快，但外国不知道，因为我们只向外国介绍古典艺术，新的东西则介绍的很少。他建议我们每年举行一次戏剧节，请外国有名的戏剧家和演员来观摩……
    马拉帕尔特自己的写作面颇宽，写论文、速写、通信、小说、剧本。他曾写过“列宁传”一本书。他写的一个剧本“资本论”，描写马克思在伦敦的生活情况的，于1949年在巴黎曾上演九十多场，尽管资产阶级多方阻挠、反对。
    最使马拉帕尔特感动的是中国的监狱。原来，当中国艺术团在意大利演出的时候，意大利某些不怀好意的记者在报上写道：“不要给我们看京戏，让我们 看看中国的监狱吧！”也正是这个原因，马拉帕尔特特别去参观了北京的监狱。第一个印象使他惊奇的是监狱里没有铁栏杆等等，里面非常清洁。再则是犯人们可以在狱中来往走动，不受限制。他说，中国监狱对犯人的待遇是真正人道主义的。他说一般的刑法都是镇压，是惩办；但在中国是教育。这就是最大的特点。马拉帕尔特举他自己住过监狱的经验说，平常的监狱每天只允许犯人“放风”一小时，但他看见北京监狱里的犯人可以在狱中来来往往，并且可以作工、学习、参加体育、文化等等活动。这种情况在欧洲及其它各国是不存在的。那里的罪犯整天被关在屋子里，而且常受拷打。因此他说，从这里更加明显地看到了，在中国人与人之间的关系是庄严的。
    他又说过，中国人都尊重自己的劳动，这单从保存古物名胜一点就也可以看得出来。这里人与人之间的关系都很和善有礼。他在中国许多日子，走过许多地方，就没有见过一次人们打架、吵嘴、骂街的事情。
    在纪念孙中山九十冥寿的前夕，马拉帕尔特荣幸地受到了毛主席的接见并交谈了许久。这使得他当夜兴奋得睡不着。他说，他当天的小病也完全好了！事后他逢人便说，毛主席是完人，他很平常，很伟大。会见之后他写了十几页的通讯，寄给了“时代”杂志。“新生活”、“时代”都给他拍来电报说，已经收到他到中国以后所写的几篇文章，并称赞他写的精彩。（第一篇的题目是：“从莫斯科到北京”，在“新生活”上发表了。）
    马拉帕尔特游览了中国各地。在重庆旧病复发，回到北京即入协和医院治疗。我们去医院探视的时候，他总是说，要留在中国，要写完他那本已经写了二百页的关于中国的书。到他觉得非回国去不可的时候，他几次哭了，临上飞机的时候也和送他的人们拥抱而且流泪了。……
    他回国之后，意大利政府为了表扬他对文学新闻事业的贡献，给予他特别奖金。回到罗马之后他继续进行医疗。意大利各界人士，包括政府部长和他的朋友，意大利共产党领袖陶里亚蒂同志，都去医院探病访问。一位政府部长，也是马拉帕尔特生平的朋友，去看他时，他盛气责备部长们对中国的无知和意大利现政府执行别国政策不承认人民中国……（据说，他生气地叫那位来访者“滚出去！”）。
    马拉帕尔特深为自己未能在中国完成那部关于中国各方面生活的书而觉得歉仄。但他说，回国后一定也写成。我们也殷切地希望能读到这部有重大意义的书。但是不幸，病魔终于夺去了这样一个巨大的、光辉的生命。这对意大利和我们大家是多么不幸！这怎能不引起我们中国人和意大利人同样深刻的悲恸？！
    马拉帕尔特遗著有名的为：“坏了”，“皮肤”，“托司康尼人咒骂”（注：托司康尼人所说的意大利语被认为是最美的）。
    写到这里，我不禁想起：一个外国的非党的大知识分子在中国逗留的时间并不长久，却如此热情地爱我们的一切，爱我们的党，我们的人民和社会主义社会，成为了我们最好的朋友；谁都知道，今天在全世界我们有成千成百的这样的国际朋友，在这里不一个个例举了；可是我们这里的一些资产阶级右派，内中也有所谓大知识分子，生于中国，长于中国，而竟黑了良心，肆意诋毁谩骂，反对我们党的领导，反对我们人民和社会主义，你们站在马拉帕尔特的灵前，能不愧死么？？？！！！
