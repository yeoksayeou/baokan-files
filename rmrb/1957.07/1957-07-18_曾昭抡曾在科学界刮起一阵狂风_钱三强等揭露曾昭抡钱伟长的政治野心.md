    Zeng Zhaolun Once Stirred Up a Whirlwind in the Scientific Community
    Qian Sanqiang and Others Expose Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang's Political Ambitions
    At the afternoon meeting, Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang first made confessions to the scientists present. Zeng Zhaolun was the vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联), and Qian Weichang was a standing committee member. In their confessions, they expressed their willingness to bow their heads and admit their guilt to the people and would make a thorough explanation to the organization regarding their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. However, they only repeated some of the content that had already been revealed in the newspapers regarding their crimes.
    Many scientists requested to speak at the meeting. The scientists expressed their indignation at Zeng and Qian's confessions today and solemnly demanded that they make thorough confessions and not cut themselves off from the people.
    Qian Sanqiang pointed out at the meeting that the anti-socialist scientific program proposed by the right-wing elements should not be simply regarded as a matter of the scientific community, but as the first shot of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's attempt to seize our national power and attack socialism. Qian Sanqiang said that Zeng Zhaolun said in his confession that he did not participate in the conspiracy. Who is Zeng Zhaolun? Zeng Zhaolun has always been a right-wing element of the China Democratic League. Before liberation, he was a figure in Yu Dawei's group of the Kuomintang. Yu Dawei sent him to the United States for research, preparing him to return to China to work for the Kuomintang's National Defense Science Research Institute. He still has relations with the right-wing element Zhang Dongsun to this day. Zeng Zhaolun actually said that he fell into the mud pit in a muddle-headed way, which is completely a lie. Qian Sanqiang said: Just after liberation, when the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had not yet been established, Zeng Zhaolun came to Beijing first and summoned some of the academicians of the former Academia Sinica, pointing fingers and acting as if he were the president of the academy. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, when Guo Moruo was appointed as the president of the academy, he undermined the academy. At that time, the central government's policy was to break the situation of feudal separatism in the scientific community and adjust it. Zeng Zhaolun pulled away five researchers from the Institute of Chemistry, attempting to bring down the Institute of Chemistry. When his bossy style failed to achieve his goals, he tried to sabotage. He is not a simple scientific worker. Qian Sanqiang said that this spring, a whirlwind swept through the scientific community, with the so-called "people's hearts toward the academy" and the so-called "seizing scientific leadership," causing great confusion in the scientific and higher education communities. There are now clues to be found regarding this matter. After Zeng Zhaolun's visit to the Soviet Union, he said that the Soviet Union's current proposal to place the center of scientific research in the Academy of Sciences was wrong, and that the Soviet Union now wanted to make universities the center of scientific research. According to reports from students studying in the Soviet Union, after Zeng Zhaolun arrived in the Soviet Union, he asked everywhere about the shortcomings and problems in the work, and summarized these individual shortcomings, attempting to use them to overthrow the achievements of our country's teaching reform, cancel the socialist path, and take the capitalist path. After Zeng Zhaolun returned to China, he first released rumors among a small number of people, and then spread them widely, saying that it would be best to merge the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education. Zeng Zhaolun's goal was to take charge of everything after the merger. Qian Sanqiang pointed out that some of the distorted facts discussed at the six-professor meeting convened by the right-wing elements were actually the conditions they attempted to use to politically blackmail the Party Central Committee.
    Qian Sanqiang also emphasized that Qian Weichang's confession was not honest, describing his conspiratorial activities as "wanting to run a university of science and engineering." He asked Qian Weichang: What do running a university of science and engineering and your true ambition have in common? He said that Qian Weichang has not "taken off his pants" yet, and demanded that he thoroughly confess his dirty and ugly things in order to be forgiven by the people.
    Wu Youxun revealed that Zeng Zhaolun said in 1949 that he wanted to be the president of the Academy of Sciences and asked him to examine and confess. Wu Youxun said that the Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联) are one family, but Zeng Zhaolun was afraid that the Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联) would have a relationship. What kind of thinking is this, and he must also examine it. Wu Youxun pointed out that Qian Weichang's so-called "personal ambition" to run an industrial university in China like the California Institute of Technology is simply a joke. Tsinghua University is many times larger than the California Institute of Technology. What kind of "ambition" is this?
    Yan Jici said that he attended the symposium of the Academy of Sciences on the 14th and believed that Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang's confessions today did not have anything new and were very unsatisfactory.
    Yan Jici said that Qian Weichang kept talking about unified leadership of scientific research work, but his eyes were not on the Academy of Sciences or the Science Planning Commission, but on the China Democratic League.
    Yan Jici also wanted Qian Weichang to confess his relationship with Chu Anping. He said that Chu mentioned at a symposium of the Jiusan Society that Chu had given Qian four letters from late May to early June and had been to Tsinghua University once or twice. What did they talk about?
    Hou Debang said that the right-wing elements said that the Communist Party cannot lead science. The All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联) is a vivid example: the Party's leadership of the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联) gives us the original impetus. With the leadership and help of the Party and the Science Planning Commission, our future work can enter a new stage, and we have the confidence and conditions to advance towards the great scientific advance.
    More than 100 people attended the meeting, including members of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies (科联), heads of various specialized societies, and heads of branch societies in various provinces and cities. The meeting is scheduled to last four days and end on the 20th.

### 曾昭抡曾在科学界刮起一阵狂风  钱三强等揭露曾昭抡钱伟长的政治野心

    曾昭抡曾在科学界刮起一阵狂风
    钱三强等揭露曾昭抡钱伟长的政治野心
    下午的会上，首先由曾昭抡、钱伟长向到会科学家作交代。曾昭抡是科联副主席，钱伟长是常务委员。他们在交代中表示愿意向人民低头认罪，并将向组织彻底交代他们的反党反社会主义的言行。但是他们对自己的罪行只重复了报纸上已经揭露过的一些内容。
    很多科学家要求在会上发言。科学家们对曾、钱今天的交代表示愤慨，严正地要求他们作彻底交代，不要自绝于人民。
    钱三强在会上指出，右派分子提出的反社会主义科学纲领不能简单地看成科学界的事，而是章罗联盟窃取我们国家政权向社会主义进攻的第一炮。钱三强说，曾昭抡在交代中说他没有参加预谋。我们问曾昭抡是什么人？曾昭抡一直是民盟右派，他在解放前是国民党俞大维集团的人物，由俞大维派到美国研究，准备回国以后搞国民党国防科学研究所的工作。他同右派分子张东荪一直到现在还有关系。曾昭抡居然说是糊里糊涂掉在泥坑里，完全是骗人。钱三强说：刚刚解放，中华人民共和国中央人民政府还没有成立的时候，曾昭抡先来到北京，召集前中央研究院的一部分院士，指手划脚，俨然以科学院院长自居。中央人民政府成立后，任命郭沫若为科学院院长，他就破坏科学院。当时中央的政策就是把科学界封建割据的局面打破，加以调整，曾昭抡就拉走化学研究所的五位研究员，企图搞垮化学所。他的把头作风达不到目的时，就设法拆台。他不是一个简简单单的科学工作者。钱三强说，今年春天，科学界刮起了一阵狂风，所谓“人心向院”，所谓“抢科学领导权”，造成科学界和高等教育界很大混乱。这件事现在已有线索可寻。曾昭抡访苏回国以后，说苏联现在提出把科学研究的中心放在科学院是错了，苏联现在要以大学为科学研究中心。据留苏学生的报告，曾昭抡到苏联以后，到处问工作中的缺点和问题，并把这些个别的缺点作成总结，企图用以推翻我国教学改革的成绩，取消走社会主义道路，而走资本主义道路。曾昭抡回国以后，先在少数人中放空气，然后扩大传播，说最好科学院和高教部合一。曾昭抡的目的就是合一后他一起抓。钱三强指出，右派分子召集的六教授会议所谈的一些歪曲事实的情况，实际上是他们企图作为向党中央进行政治讹诈的条件。
    钱三强还着重指出钱伟长交代不老实，把他的阴谋活动说成是“想办一所理工大学”，他问钱伟长：办理工大学与你的真正野心有何共同之处？他说，钱伟长到现在还没有“脱裤子”，要求他把那肮脏的丑恶的东西彻底交代出来，才能得到人民的宽恕。
    吴有训揭发曾昭抡1949年曾说想做科学院院长，要他检查交代。吴有训说，科学院和科联是一家，但曾昭抡唯恐科学院和科联发生了关系，这是什么思想，也要检查。吴有训指出，钱伟长交代的所谓“个人野心”是要在中国办一个像美国加里福尼亚理工学院一样的工业大学，简直是笑话，清华大学不知要比加里福尼亚理工学院大多少倍，这算是什么“野心”？
    严济慈说，他参加了14日科学院的座谈会，认为曾昭抡、钱伟长今天的交代没有一点新东西，非常不满意。
    严济慈说，钱伟长口口声声要科学研究工作的统一领导，他的心目中不是科学院、不是科学规划委员会，而是民盟。
    严济慈还要钱伟长交代和储安平的关系。他说，储在九三学社的一次座谈会上谈到：在5月下旬到6月初，储曾给钱四封信，并到清华大学去过一到两次，都谈了些什么内容？
    侯德榜说，右派分子说共产党不能领导科学。科联就是生动的事例：党领导科联就给我们原动力。我们得到党和科学规划委员会的领导和帮助，今后的工作可以进入新的阶段，我们有信心有条件向科学大进军。
    出席这次会议的有科联全国委员会委员、各专门学会负责人、各省市分会负责人等一百多人。会议预定举行四天，二十日结束。
