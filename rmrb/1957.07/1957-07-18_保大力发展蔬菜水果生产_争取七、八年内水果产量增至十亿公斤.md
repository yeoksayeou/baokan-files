    Bulgaria Vigorously Develops Vegetable and Fruit Production
    Striving to Increase Fruit Production to One Billion Kilograms Within Seven or Eight Years
    This newspaper reports: Bulgaria is vigorously developing specialized crops – vegetables, grapes, and fruits. In the coming years, Bulgaria will expand the area of greenhouses for vegetable production on a large scale, expand the area of grape and fruit orchards, and strive to increase fruit production from 190 million kilograms in 1955 to 1 billion kilograms within seven or eight years.
    Bulgaria is a mountainous country with many slopes and relatively infertile soil, unsuitable for growing grains and cotton, but suitable for developing grape and fruit orchard industries. Bulgaria is a well-known vegetable and fruit producing country in Europe, with a long tradition and rich experience in this regard, and has always been valued by European countries. At the International Vegetable Conference held in Moscow in August 1956, delegates from participating countries unanimously emphasized the tremendous achievements Bulgaria had made in horticulture.
    Since liberation, the Bulgarian government has paid great attention to planting vegetables and fruits. Vegetable production in 1948 had already doubled that of the pre-war period, and by the last year of the First Five-Year Plan (1952) it had increased fivefold. The area of small greenhouses in 1951 was thirty times more than in 1939. In the past decade, ten million fruit trees have been planted on 51,200 hectares of land across the country. This year, Bulgaria's early-ripening field tomato planting area will increase from 3,200 hectares last year to 4,100 hectares, and exports will increase from 50 million kilograms last year to 80 million kilograms; the early-ripening small greenhouse cucumber planting area will increase from 50 hectares to 110 hectares, and exports will increase to 4 million kilograms. The area of vineyards and orchards will also increase significantly.
    The production of vegetables and fruits is of great significance to Bulgaria's national economy. They rank second only to tobacco in Bulgaria's export trade. In 1956, the export volume of fresh tomatoes reached more than 50 million kilograms, and the export volume of fresh peppers reached more than 2.4 million kilograms.

    保大力发展蔬菜水果生产
    争取七、八年内水果产量增至十亿公斤
    本报讯  保加利亚正在大力发展精耕作物——蔬菜、葡萄、水果。在今后几年内，保加利亚将大规模地扩充生产蔬菜的温室面积，扩大葡萄和果园的面积，并争取水果的产量在七、八年内从1955年的一亿九千万公斤增加到十亿公斤。
    保加利亚是个多山的国家，坡地很多，土壤比较贫瘠，不适于种植谷物和棉花，而适于发展葡萄和果园业。保加利亚在欧洲是一个有名的出产蔬菜和水果的国家，在这方面有悠久的传统和丰富的经验，并且一向为欧洲各国所重视。1956年8月在莫斯科举行的国际蔬菜会议上，与会各国代表曾一致强调指出了保加利亚在园艺方面所取得的巨大成就。
    解放后，保加利亚政府对种植蔬菜和水果十分注意。1948年的蔬菜生产量就已增为战前的两倍，而到第一个五年计划的最后一年（1952年）已增为战前的五倍。1951年小温室的面积比1939年多三十倍。最近十年来，已在全国五万一千二百公顷土地上种了一千万株果树。今年，保加利亚的早熟田间番茄种植面积将由去年的三千二百公顷增加为四千一百公顷，出口量将由去年的五千万公斤增加为八千万公斤；早熟小温室黄瓜种植面积将由五十公顷增加为一百一十公顷，出口量将增为四百万公斤。葡萄园和果园面积也要增加很多。
    蔬菜和水果的生产对保加利亚的国民经济有很大的意义，它们在保加利亚的出口贸易中仅次于烟草而占第二位。1956年鲜番茄出口量达到五千万公斤以上，鲜椒出口量达到二百四十万公斤以上。
