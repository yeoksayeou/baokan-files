    U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem's Military Conspiracy in South Vietnam
    Vietnam Guo Ping
    U.S. imperialism has long plotted to replace France in Vietnam. However, the active realization of this conspiracy occurred after the U.S. sent Ngo Dinh Diem back to South Vietnam to take charge of the government. Since then, especially in the past year, the U.S. has penetrated deeper into South Vietnam, and U.S. influence has expanded in all aspects.
    Politically, American advisors have virtually taken control of all administrative power in various departments of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. They can take various measures related to reorganizing institutions and training cadres. The American "advisory group" headed by Walter M. Goode, sent to South Vietnam in early 1956, helped Ngo Dinh Diem draft a plan to reorganize administrative institutions and redraw provincial boundaries. At the same time, they expelled all pro-French elements from the government, established a military rule system in various provinces and counties, and appointed officers from Ngo Dinh Diem's army to take control of local governments. In order to eliminate the various opposing religious sects, they concentrated their efforts on large-scale sweeps; they also used all means to buy off, win over, and divide the ranks of the sects, arresting or killing their key figures. In order to suppress the South Vietnamese people's movement for unification and to create excuses for massacres of those who participated in the war of resistance and supported peace and unification, they frantically carried out the so-called "Communist eradication campaign" as a "national policy." In addition, they have been vigorously developing various reactionary parties, sending out henchmen to establish various yellow trade unions, attempting to disrupt the struggle direction of the South Vietnamese workers' movement...
    Economically, U.S. capital is increasingly penetrating South Vietnam. Under the guise of "aid," U.S. capital controls the economy of South Vietnam, turning it into a market for dumping U.S. surplus goods. At the same time, they have begun to gradually implement plans to invest in South Vietnam, to encompass the rich resources of half of Vietnam. Since January 1955, the U.S. has directly provided "U.S. aid" to Ngo Dinh Diem, which is controlled by the "U.S. Public Representative Group." By inspecting the use of "U.S. aid," this delegation directly signed contracts with some U.S. and Japanese companies to build some small projects such as road construction, the establishment of transportation systems, etc. In terms of foreign trade, this delegation has the full authority to decide on the types and prices of import and export goods. Through these measures, the proportion of goods imported into South Vietnam from the U.S. and Japan rose from 22.5% of South Vietnam's total imports in 1955 to 51.5% in the first eleven months of 1956. As for direct investment, although only a few U.S. companies are currently making small-scale investments, according to the treasonous treaties recently signed by Ngo Dinh Diem in Washington and the United States, U.S. investment will increase even more in the near future.
    However, the U.S. attaches greater importance to the military aspect. As is well known, the U.S. has placed South Vietnam under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (also known as the U.S.) through the Southeast Asia Aggression Treaty. The number of "Military Assistance Advisory Group" and military training group personnel stationed in South Vietnam has increased from 391 in September 1955 to 1,200 in May 1956. From central agencies to military schools and divisions, there are organizational systems of American "advisors." In each military region and division unit, there is an agency called the "Research and Training Committee," including five to seven American officers from the rank of major to colonel, who control guidance on army building, combat, and administrative management. Even in some independent units or logistics units, there are also American "advisors." The overall authority to control the training and command of the South Vietnamese army rests with the past "Military Training, Reorganization, and Inspection Group" and the current "Combat Troop Training Group" organizations.
    The U.S. plans to build Ngo Dinh Diem's army into a modern regular army, making it a capable tool of aggression in the future. Last year, the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem advocated vigorously consolidating the rear and completing the construction of military strength, mainly the army. In terms of organization and establishment, the U.S. plans to establish ten divisions, or 155,000 regular troops, for Ngo Dinh Diem. In the future, this number may increase to 170,000, and they intend to organize them into army corps. In order to realize this expansion plan, Ngo Dinh Diem has issued a decree implementing a "military service" system. They plan to enlist young people aged 20 to 21 into the army before August this year to be used as cannon fodder for them. While developing the army, they are also paying attention to further developing the air force and navy, separating the air force and navy commands from the General Staff Department. The U.S. has revealed that the navy is not only important to Ngo Dinh Diem but also plays a role in the future plans of the Southeast Asia Aggression Group. In addition to the regular army, the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem are also paying special attention to developing local armed forces, increasing them from 45,000 to 75,000. They believe that this is a necessary force for "pacifying" local areas, suppressing mass movements, and allowing the main forces to build with a free hand; it is also an important reserve force for the future development of the regular army. In addition, they are also working hard to organize local "Civil Defense Groups" to patrol, guard, and serve as secret agents and spies in the countryside. At the same time, they can cooperate with the regular army and local armed forces to suppress mass struggle movements and clear out opposing factions.
    In terms of military training, it must be emphasized that the issue of cadre training is something that the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem pay special attention to. In addition to running some short-term military training courses at various training centers in the country, Ngo Dinh Diem also sent many officers to the United States, the Philippines, and Hawaii for training in accordance with U.S. orders. While implementing military training, the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem also instilled reactionary political education in the army, organizing the so-called "Labor Personalist Party" and "National Revolutionary Movement Party" among the officers.
    While establishing and training the army, they also expanded various military bases and rebuilt the transportation system in South Vietnam. They have begun to build and expand air force bases such as U Cape, Bien Hoa, Nha Trang, and Phu Bai, so that light jet fighters can land in these places. Dozens of other airports have also been built. In terms of naval bases, they rebuilt the ports of Saigon, Tourane, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Ba Vi. On the other hand, they spent 20 million U.S. dollars to rebuild the important strategic highways that were destroyed during the War of Resistance.
    While building the South Vietnamese army, the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem are also vigorously launching espionage activities against North Vietnam, attempting to undermine the peaceful construction of the Northern people.
    The U.S. has a comprehensive plan to control the military power of South Vietnam, because they believe this is an extremely important issue. In the $300 million annual "aid" that the U.S. gives to Ngo Dinh Diem, military "aid" in the form of weapons and equipment accounts for more than $200 million, and another part called economic and technical "aid" is actually also military "aid," which is not included. This part is mostly used to build highways, seaports, and airports. This "aid" accounts for 46% of Ngo Dinh Diem's entire fiscal budget, 90% of his military expenditure in 1956, and 85.5% of his military expenditure in 1957.
    The U.S.'s conspiracy to control South Vietnam, turn South Vietnam into a military base, and prepare to invade North Vietnam is becoming increasingly clear. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime is becoming increasingly fascist, accumulating many sharp contradictions. The economy of South Vietnam is declining. The dissatisfaction of the people of all strata with the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is growing day by day. Although their struggle movement has encountered many difficulties, it is still developing continuously, and the confrontational activities of the various religious sects are still likely to be prolonged. Within the Ngo Dinh Diem army, war-weariness and dissatisfaction with American officers are also increasing daily, and the phenomenon of desertion is quite common. Within the Ngo Dinh Diem group, incidents of mutual struggle for power and profit are also increasingly exposed. These are the inevitable consequences of the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of war preparation, and these consequences will bring them insurmountable difficulties.

    美国和吴庭艳在南越的军事阴谋
    越南  国平
    美帝国主义老早就阴谋要取代法国在越南的地位。但是这种阴谋的积极实现，则是在美国把吴庭艳送回南越去执掌政权以后。从那个时候以来，特别是在去年，美国已更加深入南越，美国的势力在各方面都日益扩张。
    政治方面，在吴庭艳政权的各个部门中，美国顾问已实际掌握了一切行政权力，他们可以采取有关改组机构和培养干部的各项措施。1956年初被派来南越的以瓦尔特·莫德为首的美国“顾问团”，曾帮助吴庭艳起草了改组行政机构和重新划分省界的计划，同时，把所有亲法分子都从政权中排挤出去，在各省、县建立起军事统治制度，委派吴庭艳军队中的军官去掌握地方政权。为了消灭各个对立的教派，他们集中力量进行了大规模的扫荡；他们还用尽各种手段来收买、拉拢和分化各教派的队伍，逮捕或杀害其首要人物。为了镇压南越人民的统一斗争运动并为大批杀害那些参加过抗战和拥护和平、统一的人制造借口，他们疯狂地进行所谓“肃共战役”把它当成一项“国策”。此外，他们还极力发展各个反动党派，派遣爪牙出来成立各种黄色工会，企图打乱南越工人运动的斗争方向……。
    经济方面，美国资本正日益深入地侵入南越。在“援助”的幌子下面，美国资本控制了南越的经济，把南越变成倾销美国剩余商品的市场。同时，他们还开始逐步实现向南越投资的计划。以囊括半个越南的丰富资源。从1955年1月起，美国已把“美援”直接交给吴庭艳，这些“援助”是由“美国公务代表团”这一机构支配的。通过检查“美援”的使用情况，这个代表团直接和美国、日本的一些公司签订合同，修建一些小型工程如筑路、建立交通系统等等。对外贸易方面，这个代表团全权决定了关于出入口货的种类和价格。通过这些措施，就使美国和日本输入南越的商品从1955年占南越入口总值的22.5％上升到1956年头十一个月内的51.5％。至于直接投资经营方面，虽然目前只有几家美国公司在进行小规模的投资，但根据最近吴庭艳在华盛顿和美国所签订的卖国条约，不久以后，美国的投资将更加多起来。
    但是，美国更重视的是军事方面。如所周知，美国曾经通过东南亚侵略条约把南越置于东南亚侵略集团（也即美国）的“保护”之下。美国驻南越的“军事援助顾问团”和军事训练团的人数已经从1955年9月的三百九十一名增加到1956年5月的一千二百名。从中央机关到各军事学校、各师团，都有美国“顾问”的组织系统。在各军区和各师团单位中，都设有一个名为“研训委员会”的机构，包括有五名到七名自少校至上校的美国军官，他们掌握着关于建军、作战和行政管理等指导权。甚至在一些独立单位或后勤单位也都设有美国“顾问”。至于总的掌握南越军队的训练和指挥权限的，则是过去的“军事训练、整编、视察团”和目前的“战斗部队训练团”机构。
    美国计划把吴庭艳的军队建立成一支现代化的正规军，使它成为它将来得力的侵略工具。去年，美国、吴庭艳的主张是极力巩固后方，完成军事力量的建设，主要是陆军。组织编制方面，美国计划为吴庭艳建立十个师团即十五万五千人的正规军。将来，这个数目可能增加到十七万人，他们打算组织成兵团。为了实现这个扩军的计划，吴庭艳已经颁令实行“兵役”制，他们打算在今年8月以前征召二十岁至二十一岁的青年入伍，去为他们作炮灰。在发展陆军的同时，他们也注意进一步发展空军和海军，把空军和海军指挥部从总参谋部分出来。美国曾经透露说，海军不仅对吴庭艳来说是重要的，而且对今后东南亚侵略集团的计划也有作用。在正规军之外，美国、吴庭艳也特别注意发展地方武装力量，他们把它从四万五千人发展到七万五千人。他们认为这是为了“平定”地方、镇压群众运动、让主力部队得以放手建设的必不可少的力量；同时也是今后正规军发展的重要后备力量。此外，他们也努力组织地方“民卫团”，借以在乡村间进行巡逻、放哨和担任密探、间谍，同时还可配合正规军和地方武装，镇压群众的斗争运动，清剿各对立的派系。
    军事训练方面，必须强调指出的是培养干部问题，这是美国、吴庭艳所特别注意的问题。他们除了在国内的各个训练中心开办一些速成军训班之外，吴庭艳还遵照美国的命令输送许多军官到美国、菲律宾、夏威夷去受训。在施行军事训练的同时，美国、吴庭艳还对军队灌输反动的政治教育，在军官中组织所谓“勤劳人为党”和“国家革命运动党”。
    在建立和训练军队的同时，他们还扩建各个军事基地和重修南越的交通系统。他们已开始修筑和扩建乌岬、边和、芽庄、府牌等空军基地，使轻型的喷气战斗机能够在这些地方降落。还有其他成十个机场也都被修建起来。海军基地方面，他们重修了西贡、土伦、归仁、芽庄、巴巍各海港。另方面，他们又花了二千万美元来修建那些抗战时期被破坏的重要的战略公路。
    在建立南越军队的同时，美国、吴庭艳还极力对越南北方展开间谍活动，企图破坏北方人民的和平建设。
    美国有着一个控制南越军事力量的全面计划，因为他们认为这是极端重要的问题。在美国给吴庭艳的三亿美元的年度“援助”中，武器、装备部分的军事“援助”即占到二亿美元以上，而另外一部分名为经济、技术“援助”实则也是军事“援助”的项目还未计算在内。这一部分大多用于修建公路、海港和机场。这笔“援助”款项占吴庭艳整个财政预算的46％，占其1956年军事费用的90％，占1957年军事费用的85.5％。
    美国控制南越，变南越为军事基地并准备侵略越南北方的阴谋，已日益昭著。吴庭艳政权已日益法西斯化，积累着许多尖锐的矛盾。南越的经济日趋没落。各阶层人民对吴庭艳政权的不满与日俱增。他们的斗争运动虽遇到许多困难，但仍不断发展，各教派的对抗活动仍有可能延长。在吴庭艳军队中，厌战情绪和对美国军官的不满也日有增加，开小差的现象已相当普遍。在吴庭艳集团内部，互相争权夺利的事件也日益露骨地暴露出来。这是美国、吴庭艳备战政策的必然后果，这种后果将给他们带来难以克服的困难。
