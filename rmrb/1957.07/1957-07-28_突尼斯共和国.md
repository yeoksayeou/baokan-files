Republic of Tunisia

The Republic of Tunisia, proclaimed on the 25th of this month, is located on the North African coast. It borders the Mediterranean Sea to the north, across from the Italian island of Sicily. It is bordered by Libya to the east and Algeria to the west. The Sahara Desert lies to the south. Its residents are primarily of Arab ethnicity. The population is approximately 3.8 million. The area is 155,800 square kilometers.

Tunisia is rich in resources. The main mineral product is phosphate, and there are also abundant reserves of zinc, lead, petroleum, coal, iron, non-ferrous metals, and uranium. The main agricultural products are grains, wines, cork, and olives, and it also produces agricultural specialties such as henna, pistachios, and pomelos.

Tunisia is an ancient civilization. The ruins of Carthage, the famous ancient state that rivaled Rome in world history, are still visible in Tunisia. The Romans later cultivated it into a fertile granary. Arabs settled here in the seventh century AD, bringing Islamic culture and the Arabic language.

In the eighth century AD, Tunisia became an independent kingdom. In the eighteenth century, it was occupied by Turkey. The claws of French colonialists reached into Tunisia in the nineteenth century, forcing the King of Tunisia to sign the Treaty of Bardo, turning Tunisia into its protectorate.

The Tunisian people are brave and patriotic, and they have resolutely launched a struggle for national independence against French imperialists, without interruption for more than seventy years. After World War II, the scale of the struggle became even larger, including large-scale strikes, market boycotts, and armed struggle. In March 1956, French colonialists were finally forced to announce the abolition of the Treaty of Bardo, recognizing the independence of the Kingdom of Tunisia. Peace-loving people around the world have warmly congratulated the Tunisian people on their major victory in the struggle for national independence.

French colonialists ruled Tunisia for seventy-five years, carrying out ruthless exploitation, arousing popular anger and resentment. Tunisia is mainly agricultural, but French landlords occupied four-fifths of the most fertile land in the country. They established large capitalist farms, hired a large number of agricultural workers, and controlled the entire agricultural economy of Tunisia. The three major French banks of Rothschild, Mirabaud, and Mallet controlled Tunisia's financial plans. France occupies a major position in Tunisia's foreign trade. At present, France still has 50,000 troops stationed in Tunisia and refuses to withdraw. Many French colonialists still occupy important positions in the Tunisian government and police departments.

American imperialism took advantage of the situation during World War II to launch activities in Tunisia. The United States once built naval and air force bases in Tunisia. American economic power is mainly concentrated in oil. The United States also supports and, through French colonialists, jointly sucks the fat from the Tunisian people.

Due to the exploitation of the imperialists, the Tunisian people are very poor. 65% of the people suffer from long-term malnutrition, and more than eight out of ten are illiterate. The Tunisian people are gradually changing the dark consequences left over from the colonial era. The government has decided to invest one trillion francs in the next ten years to develop the national economy, increase wages, and nationalize church property.

    突尼斯共和国
    本月25日宣告成立的突尼斯共和国位于非洲北岸。北濒地中海，与意大利的西西里岛隔海相望。东邻利比亚。西接阿尔及利亚。南部是撒哈拉沙漠。它的居民基本上是阿拉伯民族。人口约三百八十万。面积十五万五千八百平方公里。
    突尼斯物产丰富。矿产品主要是磷酸盐，此外还蕴藏丰富的锌、铅、石油、煤、铁、有色金属和铀矿。农产品以谷物、酒类、软木和橄榄为大宗，还出产指甲花、阿丹浑子和朱栾等农业特产。
    突尼斯是一个文明古国。世界历史上同罗马争衡的有名的古国迦太基的遗迹，至今在突尼斯境内历历可见。罗马人后来曾经把这里培植成肥沃的谷仓。阿拉伯人又在纪元后七世纪来此定居，他们带来了伊斯兰文化和阿拉伯的语言文字。
    纪元八世纪，突尼斯成为独立王国。十八世纪，被土耳其占领。法国殖民者的魔爪在十九世纪伸入突尼斯，强迫突尼斯王订立巴尔杜条约，变突尼斯为它的保护国。
    突尼斯人民是勇敢而爱国的，他们坚决向法国帝国主义者展开争取民族独立的斗争，七十余年从无间断。第二次世界大战以后，斗争的规模更形浩大，包括大规模的罢工、罢市和武装斗争。1956年3月，法国殖民者终于被迫宣布废除巴尔杜条约，承认突尼斯王国独立。世界爱好和平的人民都曾热烈祝贺突尼斯人民争取民族独立斗争中的重大胜利。
    法国殖民者统治突尼斯七十五年，肆行压榨，天怒民愤。突尼斯以农业为主，而法国地主就占据了全国最肥沃的土地的五分之四，他们建立资本主义大农场，雇佣大量农业工人，控制突尼斯整个农业经济。法国的洛希尔、米拉波和马雷三家大银行，掌握着突尼斯的金融大计。法国在突尼斯的对外贸易中占主要地位。目前，法国在突尼斯仍有驻军五万人，不肯撤退。不少法国殖民者还占据着突尼斯政府和警察部门中的重要职位。
    美国帝国主义从二次世界大战期间起，乘虚而入，在突尼斯展开活动。美国曾经在突尼斯构筑海军和空军基地。美国的经济势力主要集中在石油方面。美国还支持和通过法国殖民者，共同吮吸突尼斯人民的脂膏。
    由于帝国主义者的剥削，突尼斯人民十分贫困。65％的人民长期营养不良，十分之八以上的人是文盲。突尼斯人民正在逐步改变殖民者统治时代遗留下来的黑暗后果，政府决定在今后十年内投资一万亿法郎来发展国民经济，提高工资，并将使教会财产国有化。
