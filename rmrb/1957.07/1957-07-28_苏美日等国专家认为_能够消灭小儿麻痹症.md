Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Washington Dispatch: According to statistics released on the 26th by the United States Public Health authorities, the incidence of poliomyelitis (i.e. infantile paralysis) in the United States this year is more than half lower than in the same period last year. It is said that this may be the result of using the Salk vaccine.

Another Geneva dispatch: Recently, poliomyelitis experts from twelve countries, including the Soviet Union and Japan, who attended the World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, predicted that in the future, new live virus vaccines might be used to completely eliminate malignant poliomyelitis, while the Salk vaccine, which uses dead viruses, cannot achieve this goal. They called for large-scale trials of live virus vaccines. This vaccine can be taken orally instead of by injection.

    苏美日等国专家认为
    能够消灭小儿麻痹症
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国公共卫生机关26日公布的统计材料，美国今年小儿麻痹症（即脊髓灰白质炎）的发病率，比去年同期减少了一半以上。据称这可能是采用索耳克疫苗的结果。
    另据日内瓦消息：最近在日内瓦参加世界卫生组织会议的苏联、日本等十二个国家的脊髓灰白质炎专家预言，将来可能用新的活的病毒疫苗来完全消灭恶性小儿麻痹症，而利用死的病毒的索耳克疫苗是不能达到这目的的。他们要求大规模试用活的病毒疫苗。这种疫苗可以口服而不用注射。
