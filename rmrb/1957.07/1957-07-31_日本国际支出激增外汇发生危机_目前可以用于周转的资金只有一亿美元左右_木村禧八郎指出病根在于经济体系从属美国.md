Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: The Japanese Ministry of Finance estimates that Japan's state-owned foreign exchange reserves, which had already decreased to 873 million US dollars by the end of June, will decrease by approximately 90 million US dollars in July. Currently, the Japanese government has only around 100 million US dollars in funds actually available for foreign exchange circulation.

Japanese renowned economic commentator Kihachiro Kimura published an article in the August issue of "Sekai" magazine, pointing out that the domestic reasons for Japan's foreign exchange crisis are the fundamental situation and economic system of Japan's unsound economy. The subordination of the Japanese economy to the United States is also a fundamental reason.

He explained the latter reason by saying that the economic burden Japan bears due to the Japan-US "Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," and "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" is a major factor in the formation of Japan's foreign exchange crisis. For example, Japan's "defense expenditure" (direct military expenditure) of 141.1 billion yen in the 1957 fiscal year is a non-productive expense equivalent to 400 million US dollars. As a result of the negotiations between Nobusuke Kishi and the United States, this burden on Japan will be further increased. In addition, Japanese fisheries and agriculture suffer considerable losses due to the establishment of military bases by the United States on the sea and land. The restrictions on Japan's exports to China and the Soviet Union and the forced purchase of raw materials at high prices from the United States and other countries are also important reasons for the foreign exchange crisis.

This economist criticized Nobusuke Kishi's measures to borrow from the International Monetary Fund, the US Export-Import Bank, and the World Bank to cope with the foreign exchange crisis. He said that this kind of coping method will not only increasingly increase international expenditures, but will also further deepen the subordination of the Japanese economy to the United States.

In his article entitled "The Increasingly Deepening Economic Crisis," Kimura pointed out that if measures are not taken to address the two fundamental causes of Japan's economic system and its subordination to the United States, the Japanese economy will either be threatened by a foreign exchange crisis or by inflation in the future. He said that the measures currently taken by the Japanese government to cope with the foreign exchange crisis and inflation, such as restricting loans and investments, saving consumption, and strengthening savings campaigns, are measures to sacrifice small and medium-sized enterprises, workers, and farmers to rescue large monopoly capital groups.

At the same time, the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" also published an editorial today, pointing out that the Japanese government's deflationary policy is a policy that sacrifices small and medium-sized enterprises.

### 日本国际支出激增外汇发生危机  目前可以用于周转的资金只有一亿美元左右  木村禧八郎指出病根在于经济体系从属美国

    日本国际支出激增外汇发生危机
    目前可以用于周转的资金只有一亿美元左右
    木村禧八郎指出病根在于经济体系从属美国
    据新华社30日讯　日本大藏省估计，6月底已经减少到八亿七千三百万美元的日本国有外汇储备，7月间还要减少九千万美元左右。目前，日本政府实际可以用于外汇周转的资金只有一亿美元左右。
    日本著名经济评论家木村禧八郎在8月号“世界”杂志上发表文章指出，日本发生外汇危机的国内原因是日本经济不健全的这种基本情况和经济制度。日本经济对美国的从属性也是一个基本原因。
    他解释后面一个原因说，这就是说，日本由于日美“安全条约”、“行政协定”、“共同防御援助协定”而承担的经济负担，是形成日本外汇危机的重大因素。例如，1957年度的日本“防卫费”（直接军费）一千四百一十一亿日元就是一笔相当于四亿美元的非生产费用。这次岸信介同美国谈判的结果，日本的这种负担将会进一步加重。另外，由于美国在海面上和陆地上建立军事基地，日本的渔业和农业等所蒙受的损失也不少。日本对中国和苏联的出口受到了限制，被迫从美国和其他国家高价购买原料也是造成外汇危机的重要原因。
    这位经济学者指责岸信介为了应付外汇危机而向国际货币基金组织、美国进出口银行、世界银行借款的措施。他说，这种应付办法不仅会越来越增加国际支出，而且将进一步加深日本经济对美国的从属性。
    木村在他这篇题为“日益深刻的经济危机”的文章中指出，如果不针对日本的经济体制和对美国的从属性这两个基本原因采取措施的话，日本经济今后不是受到外汇危机的威胁，就要受到通货膨胀的威胁。他说，现在日本政府为了应付外汇危机和通货膨胀而采取的限制贷款和投资、节约消费、加强储蓄运动等措施，是牺牲中小企业者、工人和农民来援救大垄断资本集团的措施。
    同时，日本“每日新闻”今天也发表社论指出，日本政府的通货紧缩政策是牺牲中小企业的政策。
