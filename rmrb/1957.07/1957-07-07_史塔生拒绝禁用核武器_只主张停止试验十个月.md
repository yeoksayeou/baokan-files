Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th dispatch: U.S. representative to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, Stassen, refused on the 5th the Soviet proposal to completely ban the use of atomic weapons.

The Soviet representative, Zorin, had requested that in the first stage of disarmament, all countries cease testing atomic weapons and solemnly pledge not to use these weapons; in the second stage of disarmament, all countries guarantee not to use these weapons, and cease production and destroy these weapons. In presenting his counter-proposal, Stassen said that the United States was not prepared to undertake the obligation, along with other countries, to ban the use of atomic weapons. The United States only advocates stopping atomic weapon testing for ten months, followed by a cessation of atomic weapon production and the transfer of a portion of nuclear military reserves to peaceful uses under international supervision.

Stassen said that as for how much fissile material should be taken from military reserves, countries could decide through international agreements, for example, the United States would contribute 53% and the Soviet Union 47%.

Stassen admitted that the method he proposed for transferring military-use fissile material to peaceful uses would, in effect, still allow relevant countries to control a significant amount of nuclear weapons and would allow those countries that had already begun to manufacture atomic weapons to complete these weapons. He also stated that even if everyone agreed to stop producing atomic weapons, the United States would retain the right to improve these weapons. At the same time, this proposal does not preclude the United States from training the troops of other countries to use atomic weapons and stationing atomic weapons in those countries.

The British and Canadian representatives supported Stassen's speech. Zorin said he would study the American proposal.

    史塔生拒绝禁用核武器
    只主张停止试验十个月
    据新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：出席联合国裁军小组委员会会议的美国代表史塔生5日拒绝苏联要求完全禁止使用原子武器的建议。
    苏联代表佐林曾经要求，在裁军的第一阶段，各国停止试验原子武器和郑重保证不使用这些武器；在裁军的第二阶段，各国保证不使用这些武器，并且停止生产以及毁销这些武器。史塔生在提出他的反建议时说，美国不准备同其他国家一道承担禁止使用原子武器的义务。美国只主张停止试验原子武器十个月，接着在国际监督下停止原子武器的生产和把一部分的原子核军事储备转用于和平用途。
    史塔生说，至于要从军事储备的裂变物质中拿出多少来，各国可以通过国际协定来决定，例如美国拿出53％，苏联拿出47％。
    史塔生承认，他提出的把军事用的裂变物质转用于和平用途的办法实际上仍允许有关国家掌握相当数量的核武器，并且允许那些已经开始制造原子武器的国家完成这些武器。他还表示，即使大家同意停止生产原子武器，美国也要保留改进这些武器的权利。同时，这个建议也不排斥美国去训练其他国家的部队使用原子武器和在这些国家安置原子武器。
    英国和加拿大代表支持史塔生的发言。佐林说，他将研究美国建议。
