    The Conspiracy of the Rightists Must Be Crushed
    Xu Guangping
    The recently concluded Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress was an extraordinary meeting. Under the intense light of the people's representatives' angry exposure and denunciation, those anti-Party, anti-socialist rightists were washed out of their dark corners one after another. The mighty momentum of the people's counterattack against the rightists formed a powerful torrent like a hundred rivers rushing to the sea. Some time ago, this small group of rightists was so arrogant, self-satisfied, and invincible! Now, under the glaring eyes of the public, they have become pathetic "rats scurrying across the street." This situation once again marks the decisive victory of China's socialist revolution, demonstrating that socialism has firmly taken root in China. Anyone who attempts to shake the foundation of socialism will only suffer a crushing defeat.
    Recalling the period before the Congress, especially before June 8th, as the People's Daily pointed out, the rightists had been "stirring up trouble, agitating the masses, plotting in secret chambers, igniting fires at the grassroots, colluding from top to bottom, echoing from all directions, estimating the situation with the aim of creating chaos, seizing power, implementing their plans step by step, and ultimately achieving their grand ambition." Their arrogance was extreme. However, the rightists' wishful thinking did not come true. After the Congress began, the representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, progressive intellectuals, youth, women, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese across the country unanimously expressed their indignation and relentlessly attacked the rightists, either citing examples, arguing based on reason, or denouncing them and exposing their ugliness. Here, the unanimous language was to fiercely strike the rightists, the unanimous feeling was to trust the Party even more, and the unanimous goal was to defend socialism. After more than twenty days of small and large meetings, the erroneous words and deeds of the rightists were exposed and refuted thoroughly. On the closing day, several key rightist elements began to surrender to the people.
    The utter defeat of the rightists was inevitable. Someone once analyzed their basic ranks, pointing out that they were nothing more than "stubborn bourgeois elements and their spokespersons who were unwilling to accept socialist transformation, such as Zhang Naiqi; political careerists who could turn their hands into clouds or rain, such as Zhang Bojun; shameless few senior intellectuals, such as Luo Longji; and the evil offspring who had split from the ranks of feudal landlords and warlord bureaucrats, such as Long Yun and Huang Shaohong." (Words of Mr. Cheng Qian) With the strength of this small group of people, they dared to provoke more than 90% of the people across the country, which was truly like an ant trying to shake a big tree. How could they not suffer a crushing defeat?
    As for the strategies and tactics adopted by the rightists, although they had organizations, plans, programs, and lines, the methods they used, apart from distortion, sophistry, rumor-mongering, deception, defamation, slander, incitement, and arson, despite fabricating thousands of reasons, none of them could stand on their own two feet in broad daylight. Therefore, they only aroused the unanimous indignant refutation of the people's representatives. For example, a worker representative said: "If anyone wants to oppose the Communist Party and socialism, then we workers will pick up our hammers and fight them." A peasant representative said: "Whoever dares to oppose socialism, we will break his spine." Another peasant representative warned the rightists: "If you stubbornly refuse to turn back and insist on taking the old road, then please think about it, are the carrying poles and hoes in the hands of us peasants 'vegetarian'?" Nineteen representatives of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers jointly stated: "If anyone dares to undermine our sacred socialist cause, we will, like we did in the past to deal with all counter-revolutionaries, together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly defeat it and eliminate it!" The speaker also read a letter on behalf of an excellent machine gun shooter, vividly and powerfully answering the anti-communist clamor of Wang Dezhou and his ilk. The letter said: "Mr. Wang Dezhou, I am an excellent machine gun shooter. When the time comes, I will definitely aim at those anti-Party, anti-people, and destructive socialist guys, not too high, not too low, not too left, not too right, and accurately hit their clever but confused heads!" In this way, in the face of the powerful force of the people, no rightist dared to come out and be presumptuous, reverse right and wrong, or talk nonsense at the meeting, but began to stammer and reluctantly confess their crimes to the people. Of course, this is just a beginning, and the people will not be satisfied with it simply. We must continue to thoroughly and completely make them turn over their secrets, clean out the stinking vat completely. We will never call off the troops until it is thoroughly and cleanly done.
    Now that the rightists' conspiracy has been exposed and the truth has been revealed, some people still harbor a strong sense of sentimentalism and dare not criticize the rightists, feeling that they are all old acquaintances and are embarrassed to take action out of consideration for their feelings. We must recognize that rightists are careerists who have infiltrated our revolutionary ranks. They harbor ulterior motives and are determined to restore capitalism. There is a fundamental difference in goals between them and us. We see that Zhang Bojun, under the pretext of "demanding democracy" from the Party and the people, actually wants the Party and the people to follow the path he has prescribed; Luo Longji wants the Party and the people to "visit his thatched cottage thrice," actually he wants to treat the people as fools; as for the absurdities of "free elections," "alternating in power," etc., even the American and Chiang enemies are saying that these are their "'anti-communist offensive' mainland bases," which are the rightists' wanting us to "self-promote collapse," don't all of us intellectuals who have a patriotic heart, a sense of justice, and have received several years of Party education after liberation see this? Therefore, we must relentlessly expose and refute the rightists. On all matters of principle, we must dare to engage in struggle, and we must not be timid in the face of major issues of right and wrong. This is a fundamental issue concerning the survival of our country, and there is no room for compromise. If we still wear the mask of sentimentalism, do not draw a clear line with the rightists on the principles of major issues of right and wrong, do not sever the myriad connections with our old class, and do not stand firmly on the position of the working people, even if the slogans we shout are earth-shattering, our souls will never be at peace, which will not only be detrimental to the cause of the 600 million people, but also make it difficult to guarantee that we will not suffer a major fall one day. Therefore, earnestly and resolutely engaging in the anti-rightist struggle is also a process of self-tempering and self-transformation.
    Now it seems that the basic ranks of the rightists have collapsed, and their battle plan has been disrupted by us. However, our task of counterattacking the rightists has not yet been completed. Because the rightists have not completely surrendered to the people. For example, some are still pretending to be confused, saying that the anti-rightist struggle "gave me a blow on the head, and I began to wake up" (Zhang Yunchuan), some used to publicly clamor, asking others to "help the Party rectify its work" with the attitude of "the Party likes what I like, and the Party hates what I hate," but now they want to exonerate themselves, saying that they "have in fact been captured by the ideas of Zhang and Luo" (Ma Zhemin), some are still playing tricks, saying that "with the leadership of the Communist Party, we can definitely distinguish right from wrong" (Zhang Naiqi), and even the heads of the Zhang-Luo alliance are still denying it, saying that he and Zhang Bojun "only have an ideological alliance, not an organizational alliance." In particular, if we compare the large amount of materials exposed by the masses with the so-called "self-criticisms" of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Naiqi, Chen Mingshu and others, we will easily find that they have not completely confessed their private goods to the people. We must pursue it to the end. We will never give up until the rightists have completely surrendered all their weapons!
    From this anti-rightist struggle, our people across the country have once again gained a firm belief, that is, the Chinese Communist Party is forever our guiding light, and our people across the country cannot leave her for a moment. As long as we follow this strong leadership, we will defeat all reactionary forces and their schemes step by step victoriously. In the future, we must unite more closely around the Party and strive for greater victories. The conspiracy of the rightists must be crushed, and the people's socialist cause must be victorious!

    右派分子的阴谋一定粉碎
    许广平
    刚才闭幕的全国人民代表大会第一届第四次会议，是一次不平常的大会。在人民代表们愤怒的揭发和声讨的万丈光芒下，那些反党、反社会主义的右派分子纷纷从阴暗的角落里给冲刷出来了。人民反击右派的浩荡声势，像百川奔腾似地形成了强大的巨流。前些时候，这一小撮右派分子是多么飞扬跋扈，得意忘形，不可一世啊！现在却在众目睽睽的怒视下，成了灰溜溜的“过街老鼠”了。这一情况，又一次标志着我国社会主义革命决定性的胜利，说明了社会主义在中国已经结实地扎了根，谁要妄想动摇社会主义的基础，谁只有碰得头破血流。
    回忆在大会之前，特别是6月8日以前，正如人民日报所指出的，右派分子曾经“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，或策划于密室，或点火于基层，上下串连，八方呼应，以天下大乱、取而代之、逐步实行、终成大业为时局估计和最终目的”。气焰非常嚣张。但是右派分子的如意算盘，并不如意。大会开始以后，代表全国工人、农民、战士、进步知识分子、青年、妇女以及少数民族和华侨的代表们，一致义愤填膺，对右派分子绝不宽容地加以讨伐，或举实例，据理说法，或加申斥，揭露丑恶。这里，大家一致的语言是痛击右派，一致的感情是更加信赖党，一致的目标是捍卫社会主义。经过二十几天的小会、大会，右派错误的言行被揭发、驳斥得体无完肤，闭幕之日，若干右派骨干分子开始向人民投降了。
    右派分子的遭到惨败是必然的。有人曾经分析过他们的基本队伍，指出他们不过是一些“对社会主义改造死不甘心的顽固的资产阶级分子和他们的代言人，如章乃器之流；翻手为云、复手为雨的政治野心家，如章伯钧之流；恬不知耻的少数高级知识分子，如罗隆基之流；从封建地主和军阀官僚营垒里分化出来的孽障，如龙云、黄绍竑之流。”（程潜先生语）以他们这一小撮人的力量，竟敢对百分之九十以上的全国人民挑衅，真如蚍蜉撼大树，不遭到惨败难道是可能的吗？
    至于从右派分子采用的战略战术来看，尽管他们也有组织，有计划，有纲领，有路线，但其所运用的方法，除了歪曲、诡辩、造谣、欺骗、诋毁、诬蔑、煽动、放火之外，尽管伪托千万个理由，但没有一条能在光天化日之下站得住脚，因此，只有引起人民代表同声愤慨的驳斥。例如一位工人代表说：“如果谁要反对共产党和社会主义，那我们工人就要拿起铁锤和他们拚”。一位农民代表说：“谁要敢反对社会主义，我们就要打碎他的脊骨”。又一位农民代表正告右派分子说：“你们如果死不回头，一定要走老路，那末，请你们想想看，我们农民手里的扁担锄头是‘受戒吃素’的吗”？十九位解放军和志愿军代表联合发言说：“如果有人胆敢破坏我们神圣的社会主义事业，我们将和过去对付一切反革命一样，同全国人民一道在党的领导下，彻底打垮它，消灭它”！这位发言者还代表一个优秀的机枪射手宣读了一封信，生动有力地回答了王德周之流的反共叫嚣，信里说：“王德周先生，我是个优等机枪射手，到时候我一定会对准那些反党、反人民、破坏社会主义的家伙，不高不低、不左不右，准准确确地打中他那聪明而又糊涂的脑袋瓜”！就这样，在人民强大力量的面前，会上再也没有一个右派分子敢于出来放肆，颠倒是非，胡言乱语，而开始吞吞吐吐、扭扭捏捏地向人民伏罪了。当然，这不过只是一个开始，人民不会简单到以此满意。还必须继续彻底全部的要他们把底子翻过来，把臭缸倒得干干净净，不搞得透彻、干净，决不收兵。
    现在，右派阴谋已经揭露、真相业已大白之后，有些人还存有浓厚的温情主义，不敢对右派进行批判，觉得都是过去的熟人，碍于情面，不好下手。必须认识：右派分子是混入我们革命队伍中的野心家，他们心怀贰志，一心想要恢复资本主义，他们和我们之间，有着根本不同的目标。我们看：章伯钧借口向党和人民“要求民主”，实际上是要党和人民按照他规定的路子走；罗隆基要党和人民对他“三顾茅庐”，实际上是他要把人民当作阿斗来看待；至于什么“自由选举”，“轮流执政”等等滥调，连美蒋敌人也在说这是他们“‘反共进攻’的大陆基地”，是右派分子要我们“自促垮台”，难道我们一切有爱国心、有正义感，并且在解放后受了几年党的教育的知识分子还看不出来吗？因此，我们必须毫不容情的揭发和驳斥右派分子。在一切原则问题上，我们必须勇于投入斗争，在大是大非的斗争中不能缩手缩脚。这是关系着我们国家存亡的根本问题，丝毫没有妥协的余地。如果我们还蒙着温情主义的面纱，不从大是大非的原则上和右派分子划清界限，不和自己的旧阶级斩断千丝万缕的连系，不站稳劳动人民的立场，尽管口号喊得震天价响，而自己的魂魄就永无所安，不但于六万万人民的事业不利，而且也难保证自己有一天会不摔大跤的。因此，认真坚决投入反右派的斗争，也正是自我锻炼、自我改造的过程。
    现在看来，右派的基本队伍已经溃败了，他们的作战计划也被我们打乱了。但是，我们反击右派的任务，却还没有完成。因为右派分子还没有彻底向人民投降。比如有的还在假装糊涂，说什么反右派的斗争“给了我当头一棒，我才开始清醒过来”（张云川），有的过去公开叫嚣，要别人以“党所好恶之，党所恶好之”的态度来“帮助党整风”，现在却想为自己开脱罪行，说什么他“已在事实上做了章、罗思想的俘虏”（马哲民），有的还在玩弄花招，说什么“有了共产党的领导，一定可以明是非”（章乃器），甚至如章、罗联盟的首脑也还在矢口抵赖，说什么他和章伯钧“只有思想上的联盟，没有组织上的联盟”。特别是，如果我们把群众所揭露的大批材料，和章伯钧、罗隆基、龙云、黄绍竑、章乃器、陈铭枢等人的所谓“检讨”加以对照，我们就不难发现他们并没有把自己的私货向人民全部交代出来，我们必须追究到底，右派分子不最后全部缴械，我们决不罢休！
    从这次反右派斗争当中，我们全国人民再一次地得到一个坚定的信念，这就是中国共产党永远是我们指路的明灯，我们全国人民一时一刻也不能离开她。只要遵循这坚强的领导，我们就能一步一个胜利地打败一切反动势力和他们的勾当，今后，我们要更加紧密地团结在党的周围，为争取更大的胜利而斗争，右派分子的阴谋一定粉碎，人民的社会主义事业一定胜利！
