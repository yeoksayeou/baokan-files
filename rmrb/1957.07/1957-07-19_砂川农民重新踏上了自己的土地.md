    Sand River Farmers Step Back onto Their Land
    Lán Hǎi
    In the Sand River farmland, separated from the white runway of the Tachikawa U.S. Air Force Base by only a fence, sweet potato vines are spreading luxuriantly, and lush dry rice is growing vigorously. No matter how furiously Tachikawa Air Force Base Commander Chametz rages, and no matter how faithfully Nobusuke Kishi keeps the promises he made to Eisenhower and Dulles in Washington, the crops in the fields continue to grow freely. This shows that the U.S. Air Force base's "designated expansion area" is ultimately just a plan on paper. The noise of American planes flying in the sky can never drown out the angry roar of healthy farmers. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese nation—members of the Sand River Youth Patriotic Association—sing loudly as they work in the fields. The majestic songs of the "National Independence Action Team" cross the fence, making the American soldiers in the base tremble with fear.
    From Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, a bus ride of one and a half hours will take you to the Sand River "Solidarity Station" on the Goichi Street and Mian Street that run through Sand River Town. This place has become a well-known vanguard of the national independence struggle for the Japanese people. The "Solidarity Station" is a hastily built structure of rough wooden planks. On the wall facing the street are several vivid enlarged photographs documenting the tense struggle in Sand River last year. Now, several new and even more moving photographs have been added to the wall, reflecting the new struggles and new victories between late June and mid-July of this year.
    In the autumn of the past two years, thousands of farmers, workers, and students shed blood to defend the fields outside the base fence. This year, the Japanese people have pushed the struggle inside the fence, preventing the U.S. military from surveying the land within the base and demanding the return of the runway currently used by the U.S. military.
    The base fence was torn down on June 27 when the surveying team conducted a "preparatory survey." For the first time in eleven years since the war, the people of Sand River Town crossed the fence and stepped onto the land passed down by their ancestors. They excitedly shouted: "This is our land!" "Our feet are on our own land again!"
    On July 7—the day before the official survey date announced by the Japanese government—workers, students, and cultural figures flocked from Tokyo to Goichi Street by bus. Whenever the bus arrived at the "Solidarity Station," cheers erupted. In front of the homes of Sand River Town farmers across from Goichi Street, rows of red flags shone brightly among the green trees. These red flags marked the gathering places for representatives of labor unions, students, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other groups. Representatives from bases across the country, including Soma-Hara in Gunma Prefecture, Hyakuri-Hara in Ibaraki, the airport in Niigata Prefecture, and the Komaki Base in Aichi Prefecture, also gathered at the scene.
    At one o'clock that afternoon, in the Sand River Town office building near the base, writer Tomoe Abe presided over an emergency meeting attended by professors from Gakushuin University, the University of Education, Hitotsubashi University, Waseda University, and other cultural figures, totaling sixty people. The meeting issued a joint statement: "Resolutely defend Sand River" and "Do not let the United States occupy an inch of land."
    That night, bonfires burned all night near the airport runway. This was to prevent the surveying team from secretly surveying the land like thieves.
    At 8:00 AM on July 8, dozens of armored vehicles and trucks of the Japanese police mobile unit drove from the U.S. military base to the vicinity of the runway. More than a thousand armed police got out of the vehicles and laid down spiral barbed wire within the one-kilometer-long fence, confronting more than three thousand workers, farmers, and cultural figures surrounding the fence. Under the cover of the police, the Japanese government's surveying team secretly began surveying.
    "Traitors, stop surveying!" The sea-like roar from the people's ranks terrified the police. The barbed wire fence was pushed and pressed everywhere. The spiral barbed wire hastily set up by the police was pushed into the base by one meter, two meters, three meters. The feet of the Sand River farmers stepped onto their own land within the base once again. Inside the base, the police force preventing "intrusion" and the masses of people engaged in a chaotic struggle, and the surveying team announced "survey completed" like a monkey show, then fled.
    At one o'clock in the afternoon, the three thousand people withdrew in a dignified manner and gathered at the shrine to hold a protest meeting, passing a letter of protest to the U.S. government. The letter of protest accused the U.S. Far East military policy of threatening peace and warned the U.S. government that the Japanese people would never allow the expansion of the base and would carry the struggle against military bases to the end.
    The next day, at noon on July 9, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo was surrounded by a delegation of protesters consisting of farmers, workers, and students from Sand River Town. The police authorities dispatched more than six hundred police officers, cut off traffic, and "defended" the U.S. Embassy. U.S. Embassy First Secretary Snyder, with a pale face, tremblingly accepted the letter of protest to Eisenhower from Aoki, the leader of the protest delegation and action team.
    "As long as there is one American soldier left in Sand River, the struggle in Sand River Town will not stop." This is the voice of the people of Sand River Town. In the past two years, the farmers of Sand River have all become heroes in the struggle for national independence. The heroic posture of the farmers can be seen in various civic meetings and actions. The struggle reports and speeches by the farmer representatives always inspire people. The farmers of Sand River, members of the Youth Patriotic Association, send representatives to bases across the country, giving people great encouragement. Sand River Town has become the center of the nationwide joint struggle against military bases.
    National workers, farmers, and student groups constantly send representatives to Sand River to learn from their struggle experience. International friends visiting Japan also go to Sand River Town to shake hands with the farmers, expressing their condolences and support.
    Since February of this year, the "Sand River Struggle University" has held weekly study sessions, where university professors such as Kitaro Shimizu and Satoshi Nakamura have in-depth conversations with the farmers, explaining major events at home and abroad. Kitaro Shimizu is a professor at Japan's Gakushuin University and is proud to serve as the president of the "Sand River Struggle University."
    The heroic struggle of Sand River Town has set an example for the people of Japan and has received the support of the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world. The national independence struggle of Sand River Town will eventually triumph, and the war policy of the U.S. military authorities will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in Sand River Town.

    On July 8, residents of Sand River Town erected several eleven-meter-high flagpoles outside the barbed wire fence of the Tachikawa U.S. Air Force Base runway, with flags bearing the words "Anti-Sand River Base Alliance," the flag of the Student Federation, and the Japanese flag flying on them. These aerial obstructions prevented American planes from taking off and landing on this day.
    On July 8, residents of Sand River Town, Japan, and workers and students who came to support them, engaged in a fierce struggle with armed police sent by the Japanese government. The picture shows the masses breaking through the barbed wire fence and entering the base.

    砂川农民重新踏上了自己的土地
    蓝海
    和立川美国空军基地白色飞机跑道仅有一道栅栏相隔的砂川农田中，白薯的秧蔓在茂盛地伸展，绿油油的旱稻在蓬勃地生长。不管立川空军基地司令官沙姆兹怎样暴跳如雷，也不管岸信介如何忠实于他在华盛顿向艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯许下的诺言，田地里的禾苗仍然是自由地生长，这就表明：美国空军基地的“预定扩充地区”始终不过是个纸面计划而已。天空中飞着的美国飞机的噪音，永远也压盖不了健壮农民的愤怒吼声。日本民族的优秀儿女——砂川青年爱乡会的会员们，在田野里一面干活一面高歌。“民族独立行动队”的雄壮歌声越过了栅栏，使基地里的美国兵胆战心寒。
    从东京新宿车站坐公共汽车，一个半小时后就可以到达纵贯砂川町的五日市街和面街的砂川“团结站”，这儿已经成为日本人人皆知的民族独立斗争的前哨。“团结站”是用粗糙木板匆忙搭盖起来的，它的面街的墙上，贴着几张画面生动的放大照片，这些照片记录了去年砂川的紧张斗争。如今这墙上又增加了几张新的、场面更加动人的照片，它们反映了今年6月下旬到7月中旬之间的新斗争和新胜利。
    前年和去年的秋天，数千名农民、工人和学生，流血保卫了基地栅栏以外的田地。今年，日本人民把斗争推进栅栏以内，阻止美军测量基地内的土地，并且要求归还美军现在使用着的飞机跑道。
    基地栅栏是在6月27日测量队进行“预备测量”时被砂川的抗议队伍冲倒的。战后十一年来，砂川町的人民第一次越过栅栏，踏上了自己的祖辈留传的土地。他们兴奋地高呼：“这是我们的土地！”“我们的脚又踏在自己的土地上了！”
    7月7日——日本政府宣布的正式测量日期的前一天，工人、学生、文化界人士乘着公共汽车络绎不绝地从东京涌向了五日市街。每当汽车开到“团结站”时，立即响起了一片欢呼声。在五日市街对面的砂川町农民的门前，一排排的红旗在绿树丛中发出耀眼的红光。这些红旗标示着工会、学生、社会党、共产党等团体代表的集合地点。从遥远地区赶来的群马县的相马原、茨城的百里原、新澙县的飞机场以及爱知县的小牧基地等全国各基地代表也齐集现场。
    当天下午一点，在临近基地的砂川町公所楼上，由作家阿部知工主持召开了有学习院大学、教育大学、一桥大学、早稻田大学的教授和文化界人士共六十人参加的紧急会议。会议发出了“坚决守住砂川”、“不让美国占去一寸土”的共同声明。
    这天晚上，在机场飞机跑道附近，彻夜燃烧着熊熊的篝火。这是为了防止测量队像贼似的偷着测量土地。
    7月8日晨8时，日本警察的几十辆装甲车、卡车的机动部队，从美军基地开到飞机跑道附近，一千多名武装警察一下车就在长达一千公尺的栅栏内布下了螺旋铁丝网，并且和包围栅栏的三千多名工人、农民、文化界人士对峙起来。在警察队的掩护下，日本政府的测量队偷偷地开始进行测量。
    “卖国贼，停止测量！”人民队伍发出海潮般的怒吼，使警察胆寒。铁丝网栅栏到处被推压，由警察匆忙设置的螺旋铁丝网，一公尺、二公尺、三公尺地被推进基地。砂川农民的脚，再一次踏上基地内的自己的土地。在基地内，防止“侵入”的警察队和人民群众展开乱斗之中，测量队像耍猴戏似的宣布“测量完成”，而后就逃之夭夭了。
    午后一时，三千名的人民队伍堂堂撤退，并且齐集在神社内举行了抗议大会，通过了给美国政府的抗议书。抗议书指责美国远东军事政策威胁着和平，并警告美国政府：日本国民绝对不许扩充基地，一定要把反对军事基地的斗争进行到底。
    第二天，7月9日正午，东京美国大使馆被砂川町的农民、工人和学生的抗议代表团包围。警察当局出动了六百多名警察，断绝了交通，对美国大使馆进行“防卫”。美国大使馆一等秘书斯纳德面色发青，颤抖抖地从抗议团代表、行动队长青木手中接受了给艾森豪威尔的抗议书。
    “只要有一个美国兵留在砂川，砂川町的斗争就不罢休。”这是砂川町人民的心声。在最近两年间，砂川的农民在民族独立的斗争中，一个个都变成了英雄。在各市民大会上和行动中，都可以看到农民的英雄姿态。农民代表的斗争报告和演说，总是振奋人心。砂川的农民，青年爱乡会的会员们，向全国各基地派出代表，给人们以很大的鼓励。砂川町已成为全国反对军事基地联合斗争的中心。
    全国工人、农民和学生团体不断向砂川派出代表，去学习斗争经验。去日本访问的国际友人也到砂川町去，和农民紧紧握手，表示慰问和支持。
    今年2月以来，“砂川斗争大学”每周举行一次学习会，清水几太郎、中村哲等大学教授和农民们促膝恳谈，给他们讲解国内外的大事。清水几太郎是日本学习院大学教授，他为兼任“砂川斗争大学”校长而自豪。
    砂川町的英勇斗争给日本全国人民作出了榜样，同时得到了全国人民以及世界爱好和平人民的支持。砂川町的民族独立斗争终将胜利，美军当局的战争政策一定要在砂川町遭到可耻的失败。（附图片）
    7月8日，砂川町居民在立川美军基地飞机跑道的铁丝网外面，竖起了数根高达十一公尺的旗竿，上面飘扬着写着“反对砂川基地同盟”的大旗、学生联合会的旗子和日本国旗。这些高空的障碍物使得美国飞机在这一天无法起落。
    7月8日，日本砂川町居民和前来支援的工人、学生，同日本政府派来的武装警察发生了激烈斗争。图为群众冲破铁丝网进入基地的情形。
