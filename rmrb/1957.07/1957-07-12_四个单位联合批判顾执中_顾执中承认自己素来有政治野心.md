Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: The All-China Journalists Association, the Socialist Academy, the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, and the Higher Education Publishing House jointly held a meeting today to expose and criticize Gu Zhizhong's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    Zou Fanyang of the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily), based on materials provided by Lu Yi, exposed Gu Zhizhong's reactionary remarks during this year's National Propaganda Work Conference.

    One evening before Lu Yi left Beijing, Gu Zhizhong again invited Lu Yi for coffee. He instructed Lu Yi to become active in the future, first to establish a good mass base within the Xinwen Ribao, and then to truly achieve "being the masters of our own house." Gu Zhizhong further analyzed that Jin Zhonghua was merely nominally going to become an official, and the number of Party members in the Xinwen Ribao was not large, so Lu Yi should first grasp the work of the China Democratic League branch, and actively work during the blooming and contending. He should seek out Wang Zaoshi more often, saying Wang Zaoshi was "experienced," and also urged Lu Yi to talk to Peng Wenyin more often.

    Wu Keqing, a student at the Socialist Academy and Standing Committee member of the Guangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference, exposed Gu Zhizhong's reactionary words and deeds. He said that Gu Zhizhong slandered the Party for undermining the Constitution. He fabricated many facts, saying that after the Constitution was passed in 1954, some of its articles were completely destroyed, and some were merely nominal. Wu Keqing said that Gu Zhizhong was waving the banner of "protecting the Constitution" to incite the people to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    Liu Bingji (member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association), who studied in the same group as Gu Zhizhong at the Socialist Academy, cited Gu Zhizhong's recent behavior to illustrate that Gu Zhizhong still stubbornly adheres to his reactionary stance. Liu Bingji said that when the Shanghai rightists' conspiracy activities had already begun to be exposed, and comrades asked him to explain his relationship with Wang Zaoshi, Lu Yi, and others, and his reactionary activities, he said that he had no relationship with Wang Zaoshi, Lu Yi, and others at all. Later, under the questioning of comrades, he said that Wang Zaoshi and Lu Yi deliberately pulled him out, and said that Lu Yi betrayed him. Liu Bingji asked: If you and Wang Zaoshi, Lu Yi, and others had no definite relationship, why did you say that they betrayed you?

    Hu Xingyuan of the Xinwen Ribao said that Gu Zhizhong has political ambitions. In order to realize his ambitions, for many years he wanted to master two tools: one was to run a newspaper, and the other was to run a school. With a newspaper, he could swindle and deceive; with a school, he could cultivate a private clique, recruit talent, squeeze onto the political stage, and get promoted and make a fortune.

    Li Yi, a member of the Jiusan Society and the Socialist Academy, revealed that around 1947, Gu Zhizhong, Wang Zaoshi, Peng Wenyin, and others organized a small organization in Shanghai called the "Democratic Comrades Association." He hoped that Gu Zhizhong would explain whether this organization continued to operate after liberation. In his speech at the Socialist Academy, Gu Zhizhong asked: Is it permissible for new political parties to emerge? He also said that the existing democratic parties were not working, and advocated the establishment of new political parties.

    Yang Muzhi, a member of the Jiusan Society and an editor at the Higher Education Publishing House, revealed that Gu Zhizhong attempted to use the Jiusan Society organization within the Higher Education Publishing House to "set fires" in the company. Yang Muzhi said: Gu Zhizhong incited members of the Jiusan Society and other democratic parties within the Higher Education Publishing House to hold joint meetings and automatically create blackboards (bulletin boards). At the joint meeting, Gu Zhizhong slandered the democratic parties for being useless in the Higher Education Publishing House and having been nominal all along. He shouted with ambition: "Comrades, unity is strength!" He ambitiously attempted to use the rectification campaign to oppose the leadership of the Party and to create a situation where the democratic parties and the Communist Party would stand on equal footing in the Higher Education Publishing House.

    Under the accusations of those present, Gu Zhizhong expressed his willingness to confess his problems at the meeting. However, most of his confessions were materials that had already been exposed. He admitted that he had always had ambitions for political activity. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had gathered students from the Minzhi Journalism School in Chongqing to organize the "Minzhi Society." In January of this year, he wrote to his friends in Shanghai, proposing the organization of a "League of Marxists." In March, he conspired with right-wing elements Wang Zaoshi, Lu Yi, and others to take advantage of the opportunity of the Great Blooming and Contending to restore the "National Salvation Association." He said, "We have a division of labor, carrying out activities separately in Shanghai and Beijing," "Our words and deeds in the two places are mostly echoing each other."

    四个单位联合批判顾执中
    顾执中承认自己素来有政治野心
    据新华社11日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会、社会主义学院、九三学社北京市分社和高等教育出版社今天联合举行大会，揭露和批判顾执中的反党反社会主义言论和行动。
    新闻日报邹凡扬根据陆诒交代的材料，揭发了顾执中在今年全国宣传工作会议期间的反动言论。
    在陆诒离开北京前的一个晚上，顾执中又约陆诒去吃咖啡。他指示陆诒今后要积极起来，先在新闻日报内部搞好群众基础，然后真的作到“当家作主”。顾执中又分析说，金仲华不过是挂挂名去当官的，新闻日报的党员人数又不多，要陆诒先抓民盟支部这一环节工作，要在鸣放中积极干。有事多找王造时，说王造时“经验丰富”，又叮嘱陆诒多找彭文应谈谈。
    社会主义学院学员、政协广西省常委吴克清揭露了顾执中的反动言行。他说，顾执中污蔑党破坏宪法。他捏造了许多事实，说宪法在1954年通过后，有的条文被彻底破坏了，有的有名无实。吴克清说，顾执中是在打着“护法运动”的旗帜，来煽动人民反对共产党和人民政府。
    同顾执中在社会主义学院一个小组学习的刘丙吉（中国民主建国会中央委员），举出顾执中最近的表现，说明顾执中到现在为止，仍然死硬地坚持他的反动立场。刘丙吉说，当上海的右派阴谋活动已经开始暴露，同志们要他交代他与王造时、陆诒等的关系与反动活动时，他却说他与王造时、陆诒等根本没有什么关系。后来在同志们的质问下，他却说，王造时、陆诒故意把他拉出来，并且说，陆诒出卖了他。刘丙吉问：如果你和王造时、陆诒等没有一定的关系，为什么又说人家出卖你呢？
    新闻日报胡星原说，顾执中在政治上是有野心的，他为了实现自己的野心，多少年来就想掌握两个工具，一是办报纸，一是办学校。有了报纸，他可以招摇撞骗，有了学校，他可以培植私党，搜罗人才，挤上政治舞台，升官发财。
    社会主义学院学员、九三学社中央委员李毅揭露，1947年前后，顾执中和王造时、彭文应等在上海搞了一个小组织叫“民主同志会”。他希望顾执中交代这个组织在解放后是否继续活动。顾执中在社会主义学院发言中曾问：可不可以再有新的党派出现？他又说，现有的民主党派都不起作用了，主张成立新的政党。
    九三学社成员、高等教育出版社编辑杨慕之揭露，顾执中企图利用高等教育出版社内九三学社的组织在该社“放火”。杨慕之说：顾执中鼓动高等教育出版社内九三学社的成员和其他民主党派的成员举行联席会议，自动搞黑板报。联席会上，顾执中污蔑民主党派在高等教育出版社毫无作为，一向有名无实，他振臂喊叫：“同志们，团结就是力量呵！”野心勃勃地企图利用整风，反对党的领导，要高等教育出版社民主党派和共产党分庭抗礼。
    顾执中在到会者的指责下，曾在会上表示要交代问题。但是，他的交代大多是已经被揭发出来的材料。他承认他素有政治活动的野心，抗日战争时期，他曾在重庆纠合民治新闻专科学校的学生组织“民治学社”；今年1月，他写信给他在上海的朋友，倡议组织“马克思主义者同盟”，3月，又和右派分子王造时、陆诒等，图谋乘大鸣大放的机会，恢复“救国会”。他说，“我们有分工，在上海、北京分头进行”，“我们在两地的言行，多是呼应的”。
