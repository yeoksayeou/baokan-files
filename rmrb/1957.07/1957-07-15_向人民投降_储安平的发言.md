Surrendering to the People
Chu Anping's Speech

My speech at the United Front Work Department's symposium on June 1st, as well as my work at the Guangming Daily, committed serious anti-Party and anti-socialist errors. After the criticism from the people of the whole country, I now recognize my mistakes and sincerely bow my head and confess my guilt to the people of the whole country.

My statement about the "Party's World" is absolutely wrong. First of all, my saying that today is a monochromatic situation of the Party's sole rule is completely inconsistent with the facts. Since liberation, the people, under the leadership of the Party, have turned themselves into masters. Today's world belongs to the people, and the tremendous power of the people is flourishing everywhere. The Party leads, educates, and unites the people with a sincere spirit of selfless devotion to the public good. Take the People's Congress system we are currently implementing as an example. This People's Congress, which has become the organ of power at the national and all local levels, is a political power organization with the broadest democratic foundation. The National and local Political Consultative Conferences are even more able to embody the Party's united front policy of uniting non-Party members. Whether in government organs, schools, factories, or people's organizations, a large number of non-Party members shoulder important leadership positions. The Party strives to unite all forces that can be united, and consults with non-Party members on everything, soliciting everyone's opinions. Taking my own experience as an example, in the summer of 1954, my plane ticket to Xinjiang was already booked, but because it was necessary to consult on the list of People's Congress representatives, the government hoped that I would temporarily cancel the plane ticket and wait for the consultation to be completed before leaving Beijing. This shows how much importance and seriousness the Party attaches to uniting non-Party members. However, in my speech at the United Front Work Department's symposium, I insisted that "no matter how big or small a unit is, a Party member must be arranged to be the head, and nothing counts unless the Party member nods." What I said was, as the worker comrades criticized me, telling lies with my eyes open, confusing right and wrong, blurring the understanding of some of the people, and sowing discord between the Party and the people. Secondly, our constitution affirms the Party's leading position in the country's political life. The Party's policies and guidelines must first be implemented by Party members. The Party's assignment of Party members to work in various places and departments is a necessary measure for the Party to implement its policies and fulfill its historical tasks to the country and the people. Facts tell us that wherever there is no Party leadership (through Party members), the Party's policies cannot be correctly implemented, and errors are prone to occur in the work. Therefore, in our country, Party members participating in work in various places and departments is an extremely normal, reasonable, and necessary phenomenon. Not only does the constitution affirm the Party's leading position in the country's political life, but in the minds and feelings of the people of the whole country, the Party is regarded as the greatest wealth in our country, and the leading force and core force in the national socialist construction and socialist transformation. The existence and strength of the Party are a strong guarantee for defending the fruits of the people's democratic revolution, building a strong socialist new China, and guiding the people into a happy and beautiful life. The Chinese people unanimously recognize that the Party has done countless good things for the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country are cheering and proud of all the great achievements completed under the leadership of the Party, and are grateful to the Party from the bottom of their hearts. Because of this, people are clamoring for the Party to send Party members to lead them in their studies and work. The Party's responsibility and the people's interests are consistent. But I described these situations as the "Party's World," wanting to use such a label to oppose the Party's leadership. Not only that, but I further mistakenly described the Party as a sectarian organization, attempting to split the relationship between the Party and the people. The Party admits that some Party members have some shortcomings in their ideology, style of work, and certain aspects of their work. In order to overcome these shortcomings and better enhance and strengthen the Party's strength, the Party decided to conduct rectification with a serious attitude. But I described the shortcomings of certain individual Party members as the shortcomings of the Party. This fully exposed my true purpose of directly attacking the Party, thereby weakening the Party's prestige and weakening the Party's leadership. But my reactionary remarks could not withstand refutation. Once exposed by the people, it completely revealed the ugly face of me, a bourgeois rightist, as being anti-Party and anti-socialist.

I not only slandered the Party in the fallacy of the "Party's World," but I also did many things in the Guangming Daily that were detrimental to the Party and the people. During the two months or so that I served as editor-in-chief, Guangming Daily published many malicious, one-sided, and destructive reports, attacking the Party's leadership and damaging the Party's prestige. I also sent a number of reporters to nine cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Changchun, and Qingdao, to hold symposiums, specifically looking for those who were dissatisfied with the Party and dared to attack the Party to speak, attempting to damage the Party's prestige through such a concentrated form. I also published erroneous reports on the big-character posters of Peking University students, superficially to scoop the news, but in essence to add fuel to the fire. I did not approve of publishing more editorials praising the Party. When I heard the rumor from the Zhang-Luo alliance that the Party was going to withdraw from the universities, I was particularly interested and even published the unsubstantiated news that Fudan University had abolished the Party committee system. I also sent out more than 100 letters soliciting contributions, encouraging everyone to speak in conjunction with "mutual supervision." I used a bourgeois democratic point of view to understand the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and did not distinguish between erroneous reports and remarks and correct reports and remarks. I also used the same erroneous point of view to understand "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," vainly trying to use the newspaper to supervise the Party, and the purpose of supervision was essentially to weaken the Party's leadership. Under my bourgeois reactionary ideology, Guangming Daily once lost its political direction and deviated from the socialist road. As a result of setting fires everywhere, it first burned my own mind, causing me to utter the fallacy of the "Party's World" at the United Front Work Department's symposium on June 1st.

The harmfulness caused by my erroneous remarks and actions is extremely great. It caused ideological confusion among some relatively backward masses, making some people unclear about the truth of the facts in a very short period of time; it made some people who had some dissatisfaction with the Party especially increase their dissatisfaction with the Party; it damaged the Party's prestige among the masses and incited people to attack the Party. The mistakes I committed essentially served the anti-Party activities of the bourgeois rightists with the Zhang-Luo alliance as the core. According to the recent revelations in the newspapers, everyone now clearly recognizes that the Zhang-Luo alliance is an insidious political collusion, and their purpose is to expand their own strength and contend with the Party. Gradually usurp leadership. My fallacy of the "Party's World" essentially became a banner for their anti-Party conspiracy, and the point raised in that fallacy that there was not a single non-Party member among the twelve vice-premiers was actually equivalent to opening the mouth for Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji to demand the position of vice-premier. I went to see Luo Longji once on May 19th. From the perspective of my own thoughts, my visit to Luo Longji was essentially to collude with him politically. But I hadn't yet colluded with him, but he, this "death-hook ghost," used me severely. Luo Longji had already used me to directly attack the Party once. Luo Longji also wanted to use me to speak at this conference on the issue of purging counter-revolutionaries, and use me to launch discussions and attacks on the construction of the Five-Year Plan in Guangming Daily against my country's current political system. Fortunately, the Party led the people to launch the struggle against the rightists early, and the Party saved me, so I avoided making bigger and more mistakes. Zhang Bojun repeatedly instructed Guangming Daily to publish more news about people, and he obviously wanted to use Guangming Daily to strengthen the publicity for his personal activities in order to increase his political capital. Zhang Bojun also repeatedly instructed Guangming Daily to publish more news about capitalist countries, and to pay more attention to the introduction and reporting of political parties in neutral countries and left-wing parties in capitalist countries. From this point of view, Zhang Bojun not only had ambitions in domestic politics, but he also had ambitions in international politics, attempting to find imperialist bosses through some international activities. His request that Guangming Daily strengthen reporting in this area was to create conditions for his further international activities. And my set of bourgeois newspaper management policies, coupled with my own resistance to the Party's leadership, meant that my set of practices in Guangming Daily completely met the requirements of the Zhang-Luo alliance and conformed to their political ambitions.

Abroad, my erroneous remarks were also used by the American and Chiang Kai-shek enemies, leading them to mistakenly believe that there were many intellectuals in China who opposed the Party and opposed the government. They thought that some kind of turmoil they had dreamed of day and night had appeared on the mainland, so they stirred up trouble, provoked discord, and even said they wanted to "pay their respects from afar" to me, which was actually nothing more than spreading rumors and sowing dissension. Although my erroneous remarks were used by them, their hope was just a dream. In today's China, even those who have made mistakes, under the Party's generous policy of curing the disease to save the patient, still firmly demand to correct their mistakes, start anew, and strive to closely unite around the Party to serve the socialist cause of the motherland. To think that there are still some "democratic individualists" in China for the American imperialists to use is just a fantasy of the Dulles and his ilk.

The mistakes I made this time were not sudden, but had a certain historical origin. I received many years of British and American bourgeois education, and blindly worshiped corrupt bourgeois democracy. Before liberation, I opposed the Kuomintang on the one hand and the Communist Party on the other. I promoted bourgeois "liberalism" in my thoughts, and advocated taking the middle road in politics. I advocated that "free-thinking elements" should unite, which was actually telling people not to follow the Communist Party. Because I only saw a very small part of the so-called "democracy and freedom" of the bourgeoisie, and did not see the real and greater democracy and freedom of the broad working people, I mistakenly believed that "under the rule of the Kuomintang, this 'freedom' is still a question of 'more' or 'less,' if the Communist Party is in power, this 'freedom' will become a question of 'having' or 'not having'." (March 8, 1947, "Observation," page 6) When "Observation" was relaunched (November 1949), I made a preliminary self-criticism, negated my past position, and expressed my willingness to transform myself under the leadership of the Party. But in reality, at that time, I only stated my position politically, and my own position and thoughts had not really changed. Therefore, in the past few years after liberation, I superficially accepted the leadership of the Party and supported the Party, but in essence, I still had anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts. Therefore, whenever there was an opportunity, I revealed my anti-Party and anti-socialist tail. When I first made a mistake, I did not correctly recognize my mistake. For more than a month, after the criticism from the people of the whole country and the People's Daily, after the help of the comrades of the Jiusan Society, the comrades of the Guangming Daily, and the representatives of the Jiangsu group of the People's Congress, I gradually realized the seriousness of the anti-Party and anti-socialist mistakes I had committed. I realized that this anti-Party and anti-socialist activity with the Zhang-Luo alliance as the core was a frantic attack by the bourgeois rightists on the Party and the people. The current struggle is a serious class struggle. And in this class struggle, I myself played a shameful and painful reactionary role. When the whole country severely criticized me and I began to see my own mistakes, I felt extremely grief-stricken and ashamed. Every day, when the postman comrades delivered newspapers and letters to my door, I myself was too ashamed to go to the door to pick them up. The week before last, when I went to see a doctor because of illness, I didn't dare to say that my surname was Chu, fearing that the doctor would suspect that I was that rightist Chu Anping. The severe criticism of me by the people of the whole country made me seriously realize that if I didn't make up my mind and fundamentally transform my thinking and change my position, I would have no future. I especially realized that if I didn't honestly follow the Party, I would take the wrong path personally, and my work would make mistakes. The mistakes I made in Guangming Daily this time gave me the greatest education. I must bravely operate on myself, peel off my own "bourgeois rightist" skin, and resolutely stand on the side of the 600 million people. I am determined to draw a clear line between myself and the Zhang-Luo alliance ideologically and politically. And while criticizing my own mistakes, I will actively participate in the national anti-rightist struggle. My understanding of my mistakes is only preliminary, and I should continue to deeply examine the roots of my thoughts. Continue to deeply criticize my erroneous remarks. Today, in this solemn venue, and through the conference, I sincerely admit my mistakes to the people of the whole country, ask the people for forgiveness, and surrender to the people. I regard surrendering to the people as a sign of my determination to completely transform myself. I will definitely accept the leadership of the Party honestly from now on, and wholeheartedly take the socialist road.

### 向人民投降  储安平的发言

    向人民投降
    储安平的发言
    我六月一日在统战部座谈会上的发言以及我在光明日报的工作都犯了反党反社会主义的严重错误。经过全国人民对我的批判，我现在认识到自己的错误，真心诚意地向全国人民低头认罪。
    我的关于“党天下”的发言是绝对错误的。首先，我说今天是党一家天下的清一色局面，和事实完全不符。解放以后，人民在党的领导下翻身作了主人。今天的天下是人民的天下，到处蓬勃着巨大的人民力量。党以真诚的大公无私的精神领导人民、教育人民、团结人民。就以我们现在实行的人民代表大会制度来说，这一个成为全国和各级地方权力机关的人民代表大会，就是一个民主基础最广泛的政权组织。全国和各地的政治协商会议，更是最能体现党团结党外人士的统一战线政策的。无论在政府机关、学校、工厂或人民团体，都有大批的党外人士负担着主要的领导职位。党努力团结一切可以团结的力量，遇事和党外人士协商，征求大家的意见。就以我自己的经验来说，一九五四年夏天我去新疆的飞机票都定了，但是因为要协商人大代表的名单，政府希望我临时把飞机票退去，等协商有了结果再离开北京，这就说明党对团结党外人士是如何的重视和认真。然而我在统战部座谈会上的发言中，硬说“不论大小单位都要安排一个党员做头儿，事无巨细都要党员点了头才算数”。我这样说，正如工人同志批判我的，是睁着眼睛说瞎话，是混淆是非，模糊一部分人民的认识，挑拨党和人民关系。其次，我们的宪法肯定了党在国家政治生活中的领导地位。党的政策方针首先要由党员来执行。党指派党员在各个地方，各个部门工作，是党贯彻党的政策和履行党对国家对人民的历史任务的必要措施。事实告诉我们，凡是没有党领导的地方（通过党员），党的政策便不能正确执行，工作便容易发生错误。因之，在我们的国家里，党员在各个地方，各个部门参加工作，是一个极其正常的、合理的、而且是必要的现象。不仅宪法里肯定了党在国家政治生活中的领导地位，就是在全国人民的思想感情里，也都把党看成是我们国家中的最大的财富，是全国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的领导力量和核心力量。党的存在和党的强大是保卫人民民主革命胜利果实、建设强大的社会主义新中国、引导人民进入幸福美好生活的有力保证。中国人民都一致承认党给全国人民办了数也数不清的好事。全国人民正为在党的领导下而完成的一切伟大的成就而欢呼、自豪，从心底里感激着党。正因为这样，人们纷纷要求党选派党员去领导他们学习、领导他们工作。党的责任和人民的利益是一致的。但是我却把这些情况说成是“党天下”，想用这样一顶帽子来反对党的领导。不仅如此，我还进一步错误地把党说成是一个宗派组织，企图分裂党和人民的关系。党承认有些党员在思想作风上以及某些工作上有些缺点，为了克服这些缺点，更好地提高和加强党的力量，党决定用严肃的态度进行整风。可是我却把某些个别党员的缺点说成是党的缺点。这充分暴露了我的真正目的是要直接对党进行攻击，从而削弱党的威信，削弱党的领导。但是我这种反动的言论经不起驳斥，一经人民揭发，就完全露出了我这资产阶级右派分子反党反社会主义的丑恶面目。
    我不仅在“党天下”的谬论中诽谤了党，而且我在光明日报的工作中，也做了许多不利于党和人民的事情。在我担任总编辑的两个多月内，光明日报刊登了许多恶意的、片面的、破坏性的报导，攻击党的领导，损害党的威信。我还派了好些记者到上海、南京、武汉、广州、西安、兰州、沈阳、长春、青岛等九个城市去开座谈会，专门找那些对党不满的、勇于攻击党的人发言，企图通过这样集中的形式来损害党的威信。我又发表了北大学生大字报的错误报导，表面上是抢新闻，实质上是点火。我不赞成多发表歌颂党的社论。我听到章罗联盟造谣的党要在大学撤退的消息，特别感到兴趣，并且还刊登了复旦大学取消党委制的不符事实的新闻。我还发了一百多封征稿的信件，鼓励大家结合“互相监督”发言。我用一种资产阶级民主的观点来理解“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对于错误的报导和言论和正确的报导和言论不加区别。我又以同样错误的观点来理解“长期共存、互相监督”，妄想利用报纸来监督党，而监督的目的实质上就是要削弱党的领导。在我这种资产阶级的反动思想下，一度使光明日报迷失了政治方向，离开了社会主义的道路。而处处放火的结果首先是烧昏了我自己的头脑，使我六月一日在统战部座谈会上发出了那篇“党天下”的谬论。
    我这些错误的言论和行为所造成的危害性是极大的。它在一些比较落后的群众中间造成了思想混乱，使有些人在一个极短的时间里不明事实的真象；它使某些对党有些不满情绪的人格外增加了他们对党的不满；它损害了党在群众中的威信，并鼓动人们向党进攻。我所犯的错误，实质上又为章罗联盟为核心的资产阶级右派分子的反党活动而服务。根据最近报纸的揭发，现在大家很明显的认清，章罗联盟是一个阴险的政治勾结，他们的目的是想通过扩大自己的力量，和党分庭抗礼。逐步篡夺领导。我的“党天下”的谬论实质上成为替他们的反党阴谋摇旗呐喊，而在那篇谬论中提出十二个副总理中没有一个党外人士这一点，实际上也等于在替章伯钧、罗隆基开口要求副总理的职位。我在五月十九日去看罗隆基一次。从我自己的思想上来检查，我去看罗隆基，实质上是想在政治上和他勾搭。可是我还没有勾搭上他，倒给他这个“勾死鬼”狠狠地利用了一场。罗隆基已经利用我直接向党进攻了一次。罗隆基还想利用我在这个大会上为肃反问题发言，利用我在光明日报上展开反对我国现行政治制度的讨论和攻击五年计划的建设。幸而党领导人民对右派分子的斗争发动得早，党救了我，使我避免犯更大更多的错误。章伯钧一再指示光明日报多登人的新闻，他显然想利用光明日报来加强对他个人活动的宣传，以增加他的政治资本。章伯钧又一再指示要光明日报多登资本主义国家的电讯，多注意中立国家政党和资本主义国家左派政党的介绍和报导，从这一点看来，章伯钧不仅对国内政治有野心，而且他对国际政治也有野心，企图通过一些国际活动来找寻帝国主义老板。他要求光明日报加强这方面的报导是要为他作进一步的国际活动创造条件。而我的一套资产阶级办报方针再加上我自己对党的领导有抵触情绪，这样，我在光明日报的一套做法就完全符合章罗联盟的要求，符合于他们的政治野心。
    在国外，我的错误言论还为美蒋敌人所利用，使他们错觉地以为中国有很多知识分子反对党、反对政府。他们以为在大陆上出现了什么为他们日夜梦想的变乱，于是兴风作浪、进行挑拨，还说要向我“遥致敬意”，实际上无非想造谣生非，挑拨离间。我的错误的言论虽然为他们所利用，然而他们的希望只是一个梦想。在今天的中国，即使犯了错误的人，在党的宽大的治病救人的政策下，仍然坚决要求改正自己的错误，从新做人，争取紧密地团结在党的周围，为祖国的社会主义事业效力。以为中国还有什么“民主个人主义者”可供美帝利用，那只是杜勒斯之流的幻想而已。
    我这次犯的错误，并不是突如其来的事情，而是有它一定的历史根源的。我受过多年的英美资产阶级教育，盲目崇拜腐朽的资产阶级民主。在解放以前，我一方面反对国民党，一方面反对共产党。我在思想上宣传资产阶级的“自由主义”，在政治上标榜走中间路线。我鼓吹“自由思想分子”团结起来，实际上就是不要人们跟共产党走。由于我只看到资产阶级一个阶级很小一部分所谓“民主自由”，看不到广大劳动人民的真正的、更大的民主自由，因而便错误地认为“在国民党统治下，这个‘自由’还是一个‘多’‘少’问题，假如共产党执政了，这个‘自由’便变成‘有’‘无’问题了”。（一九四七年三月八日“观察”第六页）我在“观察”复刊的时候，（一九四九年十一月）初步地作了自我批评，否定了过去的立场，表示愿意在党的领导下改造自己。但实际上，那时只是在政治上表明了一下态度，我自己的立场和思想并没有真正改变过来，因而解放后这几年来，表面上是接受党的领导，拥护党，而在实质上，仍然存在着反党反社会主义的思想，因而一有机会，我就露出了反党反社会主义的尾巴。当我初犯错误的时候，我没有正确地认识我的错误。一个多月以来，经过全国人民和人民日报的批判，经过九三学社同志、光明日报同志以及人大江苏小组各位代表的帮助，才使我逐步认识到自己所犯的反党反社会主义错误的严重。我认识到这次以章罗联盟为核心的反党反社会主义活动是资产阶级右派分子对党对人民的一次猖狂进攻。当前的斗争是一场严肃的阶级斗争。而在这场阶级斗争中，我自己扮演了一个可耻的令人痛心的反动的角色。当全国对我进行严厉的批判、我开始看到我自己的错误的时候，我内心感到无比沉痛，感到无地自容。每天邮差同志送报纸信件到我门口，我自己都没有脸到门口去拿。上上星期我因病去看医生的时候，我都不敢说我姓储，深恐医生怀疑我就是那个右派分子储安平。全国人民对我的严厉批判，使我严肃地认识到，假如我不痛下决心，从根本上改造自己的思想，改变自己的立场，我就没有前途。我特别认识到，假如不是老老实实跟党走，个人就要走错路，工作就要犯错误。这次我在光明日报所犯的错误，就使我受到一次最大的教育。我必须勇敢地向自己开刀，剥去我自己的“资产阶级右派分子”的皮，坚决地站到六亿人民的一边来。我决心在思想上政治上和章罗联盟划清界限。并在批判我自己的错误的同时，积极参加全国反右派的斗争。我对我的错误还只是一个初步的认识，我应当继续深入检查自己的思想根源。继续深入批判自己的错误言论。我今天在这个庄严的会场上，并通过大会向全国人民真诚地承认我的错误，向人民请罪，向人民投降。我把向人民投降作为我自己决心彻底改造自己的一个标志。我以后一定老老实实接受党的领导，全心全意走社会主义的道路。
