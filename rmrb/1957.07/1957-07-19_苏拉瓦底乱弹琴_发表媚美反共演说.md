Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Pakistan's Prime Minister Suhrawardy delivered a speech in Los Angeles on the 17th, which was the most blatant anti-communist speech during his visit to the United States. According to a United Press International report, Suhrawardy said that Pakistan and the United States were "bound by a common destiny." Pakistan believes that world peace "depends on the leadership of the United States and Britain," and Pakistan is "very seriously concerned about communist control, infiltration, and aggression." Pakistan has no difficulty "cooperating with Western countries to help rid the world of communist aggression."

Suhrawardy said that he "absolutely cannot understand" how there could be communists in the United States.

Suhrawardy attacked the policies of India and Egypt in not participating in military blocs, and insisted that India and Egypt "despise" the United Nations. He said, "Egypt, India, and Russia are in the same boat."

    苏拉瓦底乱弹琴
    发表媚美反共演说
    据新华社18日讯  巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底17日在洛杉矶发表了一篇在他访美期间最露骨的反共演说。据合众社的消息：苏拉瓦底说，巴基斯坦和美国是“共命运”的。巴基斯坦认为，世界和平“取决于美国和英国的领导”，巴基斯坦“非常严重地担心共产党的控制、渗入和侵略”。巴基斯坦并不难于同西方国家“合作，以帮助使这个世界免受共产党的侵略”。
    苏拉瓦底说，他“绝不能理解”在美国怎么会有共产党人。
    苏拉瓦底攻击印度和埃及不参加军事集团的政策，并且硬说印度和埃及“藐视”联合国，他说，“埃及、印度和俄国是同舟共济的。”
