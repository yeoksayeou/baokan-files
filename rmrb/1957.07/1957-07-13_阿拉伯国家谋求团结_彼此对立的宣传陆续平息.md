Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, July 12th: According to a France-Presse report from Beirut on July 11th, activities are underway in the capitals of various Arab countries to restore unity.

France-Presse said that newspaper and radio propaganda, which had pitted Egypt against Iraq and Lebanon, and Syria against Jordan and Saudi Arabia, is gradually subsiding. Egyptian newspapers are about to re-enter Lebanese territory. Egyptian tourists may be allowed to spend their summers in the mountains of Lebanon.

France-Presse also said that Egyptian President Nasser dispatched General Amer, Commander-in-Chief and Minister of Defense of the Egyptian Armed Forces, to Saudi Arabia, thereby taking the initiative to re-establish rapprochement. There are also some signs of reconciliation between Syria and Saudi Arabia.

France-Presse believes that if these efforts are successful, it may be possible to convene a summit of Arab heads of state or a meeting of the Arab League in the near future.

    阿拉伯国家谋求团结
    彼此对立的宣传陆续平息
    新华社12日讯　据法新社7月11日贝鲁特消息，各个阿拉伯国家的首都正展开活动以便恢复团结。
    法新社说，使埃及同伊拉克和黎巴嫩、叙利亚同约旦和沙特阿拉伯彼此对立的报纸和电台宣传陆续平息下来了。埃及的报纸即将重新进入黎巴嫩境内。埃及的游客们也许将被允许在黎巴嫩的山中避暑。
    法新社还说，埃及总统纳赛尔派遣了埃及武装部队总司令兼国防部长阿密尔将军到沙特阿拉伯去，从而采取了彼此重新接近的主动。在叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯之间，也有部分和解的迹象。
    法新社认为，如果这些努力成功的话，那么就有可能在最近召开阿拉伯各国首脑会议，或者是召开阿拉伯联盟会议。
