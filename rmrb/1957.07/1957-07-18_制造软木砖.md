    Manufacturing Cork Bricks
    The newly built state-owned Shaanxi Cork Factory in Xi'an has recently been officially put into production. Among the existing cork factories in the country, it has the largest production scale and the newest equipment. It can produce 6,000 cubic meters of cork bricks annually. This kind of cork brick has the properties of insulation, sound insulation, pressure resistance, impermeability to water and gas. It is an important raw material for building refrigeration equipment in ships, trains, and food warehouses, and can also be used to make various bottle stoppers. Currently, most of the products produced by the Shaanxi Cork Factory are exported, with only a small portion sold domestically. This year, the factory has already accepted an order from the Soviet Union to supply 1,000 cubic meters of cork bricks.
    The raw material for making cork is called cork oak bark, also known as ear tree or flower oak. This is a tree that grows abundantly in the Qinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi and the northern slope of the Ba Mountains.

    制造软木砖
    在西安新建成的国营陕西软木厂，已经在最近正式投入生产。在全国已有的软木厂中，它的生产规模最大，它的设备最新。它每年可以制出六千立方公尺的软木砖。这种软木砖有绝热、隔音、耐压、不透水和气的性能，是在轮船、火车、食品库中建造冷藏设备的重要原料，同时也可以用它制成各种瓶塞子。陕西软木厂目前生产的产品除小部分内销外，大部分出口。这座工厂今年已经接受苏联订货，供应一千立方公尺软木砖。
    制软木的原料叫栓树皮，也称耳树或花栎树。这是陕西南部秦岭山脉和巴山北坡盛产的林木。
