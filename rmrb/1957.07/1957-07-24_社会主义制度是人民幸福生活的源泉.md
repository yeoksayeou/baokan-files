The Socialist System is the Source of the People's Happy Life
Cheng Guangrui

Vigorous Development of Productive Forces Guarantees the Growth of People's Welfare

Comrade Khrushchev once said during his visit to Finland: To resolve the dispute of which political system, which system is better, we should not use war, nor should we use atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, but we should guarantee the development of our economy and improve the living standards of our people. As everyone knows, capitalism has been developing for more than a hundred years, while socialism, from the birth of the Soviet Union, is only forty years old, and other socialist countries have only ten years or seven or eight years of history. However, since the socialist system appeared in the world with a brand-new attitude, it has proved with more and more facts its unparalleled superiority to the capitalist system, proving that it is the best guarantee for the working people to get rid of poverty and hunger, and an inexhaustible source of the happy life of the working people.

In the socialist countries that have freed themselves from the shackles of capitalism, the working people have grasped political power, eliminated the exploiting classes, and eliminated unemployment in cities and poverty in rural areas. In these countries, the capitalist mode of production that hindered the development of productive forces has been eliminated. Under the new social system, social productive forces are developing vigorously.

The national economy of socialist countries is developing at an unprecedented speed in history. The current total industrial output of the Soviet Union has increased approximately thirty times compared with 1913 before the revolution; in the decade after liberation, the industrial production of Eastern European countries has increased by two to ten times; in the seven years after liberation, China's industrial production has also increased by more than five times. The great achievements of socialist countries in socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture are important conditions for improving the living standards of the working people.

The People's Lives in Socialist Countries are Rising Step by Step

Russia before the October Revolution was a "prison of nations." The October Revolution opened the road to a happy life for the Russian people. The Soviet Union eliminated unemployment in industry long ago. With the victory of agricultural collectivization, poverty in the Soviet countryside has also been completely eliminated. Compared with before the revolution, the real wages of Soviet workers and staff in 1953 increased by about five times, and the income of collective farm members has doubled in the last three years alone.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union paid great attention to further improving the people's welfare. In addition to stipulating that the real wages of workers and staff should be increased by about 30% during the Sixth Five-Year Plan and the income of collective farm members should be increased by at least 40%, it also proposed a series of other measures to improve people's lives. In 1956, the Soviet Union made great efforts to further improve the people's welfare. For example: reducing the working day by two hours on holidays and the day before festivals, stipulating that the working day for teenagers aged sixteen to eighteen should be shortened to six hours, increasing pensions for working people, abolishing tuition fees for middle schools and universities, and increasing maternity leave. From this year on, the wages of low-wage workers will be increased by about 33%, and the working day of workers and staff will also be gradually changed to seven hours. Due to the substantial increase in the income of the Soviet working people, they are able to purchase more necessities and daily necessities. Now the various products of the Soviet food industry have increased by more than ten to thirty times compared with before the October Revolution. In order to improve the living conditions of the working people, the Soviet Union has built nearly six million houses with state funds in the ten years after the war alone, and it is expected that more than six million eight hundred thousand new houses will be built during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The cultural living standards of the Soviet people have also greatly improved.

China was oppressed and exploited by imperialism and domestic reactionary classes for more than a hundred years, and became a poor and backward country with very low living standards for the people. However, after liberation, with the rapid recovery and development of China's national economy, people's lives have also been significantly improved. In 1956, China's total agricultural output value increased by 79% compared with 1949, and farmers' purchasing power increased by more than doubled compared with 1950. In the past seven years, about 13 million people have been employed in China, and in the past four years, the wages of workers and staff across the country have increased by nearly 37%.

In the European socialist countries, the lives of the working people have also improved to varying degrees. In the old Eastern European countries, the plunder of foreign capital, the domestic bourgeoisie, and landlords bankrupted and impoverished millions of people and caused large-scale unemployment. During the world economic crisis of 1929-1933, even half of the residents with labor ability in Polish cities were unemployed, nearly one million people were unemployed in Czechoslovakia, and one-third of the teachers in Romania were unemployed. The old Hungary was called "the country of three million beggars."

The plight of poverty and hunger of the working people in Eastern European countries has undergone a fundamental change only under the socialist system. At present, in these countries, unemployment has been completely eliminated or basically eliminated, labor productivity is constantly increasing, and national income is also constantly increasing. In Poland, due to the rapid development of industry, there have been huge changes in consumption. Although the current increase in per capita annual consumption of meat, fat, and sugar in Poland has not yet caught up with West Germany and France, it has already caught up with Italy. The number of houses currently under construction in Poland is more than twice that before the war, and it is also planned to increase the real wages of workers and staff by at least 30% by 1960 compared with the last year of the Six-Year Plan. In Czechoslovakia, the amount of preferential payments in 1956 has increased to more than thirteen times that of 1937, and residents' consumption has increased to more than double that of 1953. In Romania, the real wages of workers and staff increased by 28% during the first five-year plan, and the income of farmers increased by 15% in 1955 alone. The German Democratic Republic implemented its seventeenth price reduction in 1956.

From the above description, it can be seen that the characteristics of changes in people's lives under the socialist system are: first, the current living standards of the working people in these countries have been significantly improved compared with before the revolution or before liberation. These countries have either already gotten rid of poverty and backwardness, or are getting rid of them and embarking on the road to a prosperous life. Second, it has a universal nature in improving people's living standards. In these countries, the task of the people's government and the Communist Party is to lead all the people to build socialism and communism, vigorously develop the national economy, and improve the material and cultural living standards of all the people.

How to View the Living Standards of People in Capitalist Countries

It is a fact that the living standards of people in socialist countries have been significantly and universally improved. However, generally speaking, the living standards of people in socialist countries have not yet caught up with the living standards of some capitalist countries, which is also a fact. In this case, can it be said that the capitalist system is superior to the socialist system? Of course not. Comrade Khrushchev once pointed out sharply that judging the living standards of residents under capitalism should not be based on the United Kingdom, France, and other Western capitalist countries, which have made a fortune by plundering the people of the colonies, but must be based on the living standards of the people in Asian, African, and South American dependencies to see what capitalism brings to the people.

The characteristics of capitalist economic development are first manifested in the cruel exploitation of hundreds of millions of working people in colonies and dependencies. It is estimated that American oil monopolies can exploit $4,700 from an American oil worker every year, $20,600 from a Venezuelan oil worker, and more than $40,000 from a Kuwaiti oil worker! In the United States, the average per capita annual income is thirty-two times more than in India; in the United Kingdom, it is eighteen times more than in Pakistan; in the Netherlands, it is twenty times more than in Indonesia. From these materials, it can be seen that the imperialists use this method of benefiting themselves at the expense of others to make themselves rich and others poor and hungry.

Imperialist monopoly capital not only relies on exploiting the people of colonies and dependencies to increase its profits, but also relies on exploiting its own people and making them bankrupt and impoverished to increase its profits. According to official American materials, there are now three million fully unemployed workers and nine million partially unemployed workers in the United States. In the United States, a family of four needs to spend more than $5,500 a year to maintain a decent life. However, at present, more than half of the families in the United States earn less than $5,000 a year, about one-quarter to one-third of the families earn less than $3,000 a year, and one-tenth of the families even earn only $1,000. In 1956, American private debt reached as high as $162.7 billion, most of which was debt from installment purchases of houses and goods, etc. This amount accounted for 56.8% of all after-tax personal income in the United States. In the United States, the "millionaire club" of a few monopoly capitalists and the slums inhabited by 56 million people coexist. The polarization of American society, the disparity between the rich and the poor, is becoming more and more obvious.

The Living Standards of Socialist Countries Will Eventually Catch Up With Capitalist Countries

At present, all socialist countries are vigorously developing their economies and cultures, and are carrying out extensive mutual assistance and cooperation in various aspects, in order to create better conditions to meet the material and cultural needs of the people. At present, although the lives of people in socialist countries are not as good as those in some capitalist countries, the speed at which the lives of people in socialist countries are rising and the efforts to improve people's welfare can be compared with those of capitalist countries. Comrade Mikoyan put it well: "Where is more work done for the welfare of the people, and where is the way of life better." The people of socialist countries are fully confident that with the guarantee of the socialist system and the united efforts of the people, the living standards of the people in socialist countries will surely catch up with and surpass those of capitalist countries.

    社会主义制度是人民幸福生活的源泉
    程光锐
    生产力蓬勃发展保证人民福利增长
    赫鲁晓夫同志在访问芬兰期间曾经这样说过：要解决哪一种政体，哪一种制度较好的争论，不应当通过战争的办法，也不应当用原子弹和氢弹，而是应当通过保证发展自己的经济和提高人民生活水平的办法。大家知道，资本主义的发展已有一百多年的历史，而社会主义从苏联诞生，只不过四十年，而其他社会主义国家，则只有十多年或七、八年的历史。然而，社会主义制度自从在世界上以崭新的姿态出现以来，它就以越来越多的事实证明它对资本主义制度的无比优越性，证明它是劳动人民摆脱贫困和饥饿的最好保证，是劳动人民幸福生活的取之不尽的源泉。
    在摆脱了资本主义桎梏的社会主义国家里，劳动人民掌握了政权，消灭了剥削阶级，消灭了城市中的失业现象和乡村中的贫困现象。在这些国家里，阻挠生产力发展的资本主义生产方式已经被消灭了，在新的社会制度下，社会生产力正在蓬勃地发展。
    社会主义各国的国民经济，以历史上从未有过的速度向前发展着。苏联目前的工业总产量，同革命前1913年比较，大约增加到三十倍；东欧各国在解放后的十年中，工业生产量增加了二倍到十倍；我国在解放后的七年中，工业生产量也增加了五倍以上。社会主义国家在社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造方面所取得的巨大成就，是提高劳动人民生活水平的重要的条件。
    社会主义各国人民生活步步上升
    十月革命前的俄国是“各民族的牢狱”。十月革命给俄国人民打开了通往幸福生活的道路。苏联早就消灭了工业中的失业现象，随着农业集体化的胜利，苏联农村中的贫困现象也已彻底消灭了。同革命前比较，1953年苏联职工的实际工资大约增长了五倍，集体农庄庄员的收入仅在最近三年中就增加了一倍。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对进一步提高人民福利给予极大的注意，除了规定在第六个五年计划期间要把职工的实际工资提高约30％，使集体农庄庄员的收入至少增加40％以外，还提出了一系列改进人民生活的其他措施。1956年苏联在进一步提高人民福利方面作了巨大的努力。例如：把假日和节日前一天的工作日减少两小时，规定十六岁到十八岁少年的工作日缩短到六小时，提高劳动人民的抚恤金、取消中学和大学的学费，增加孕妇的假期。从今年起，低工资工人的工资要提高大约33％，职工的工作日也将逐步改为七小时。由于苏联劳动人民收入大大增加，使他们能够购买更多的生活必需品和日用品。现在苏联食品工业的各种产品，已经比十月革命前增加了十多倍到三十倍。为了改善劳动人民的居住条件，苏联仅在战后十年中就用国家资金建造了近六百万套住宅，预计第六个五年计划期间还要建造六百八十多万套新住宅。苏联人民的文化生活水平也大大提高了。
    我国被帝国主义和国内反动阶级压迫剥削了一百多年，变成了一个贫穷落后的国家，人民生活水平非常低下。然而，解放后随着我国国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，人民生活也得到显著的改善。1956年，我国农业生产总值比1949年增长79％，农民购买力比1950年增长了一倍以上。在过去七年中，我国约有一千三百万人就业，四年来，我全国职工的工资提高了将近37％。
    在欧洲各社会主义国家中，劳动人民生活也有了不同程度的提高。在旧日的东欧各国，外国资本、本国的资产阶级和地主的劫掠，使千百万人民破产和贫困，并且造成大规模的失业现象。在1929—1933年世界经济危机时期，波兰城市内全部有劳动能力的居民中甚至有一半是失业的，捷克斯洛伐克差不多有一百万人失业，罗马尼亚则有三分之一的教师失业。旧日的匈牙利则被称为“三百万乞丐的国家”。
    东欧各国劳动人民的这种贫困饥饿的处境，只有在社会主义制度下才有了根本的改变。目前，在这些国家里，失业现象已经完全消灭或者基本消灭了，劳动生产率正在不断地提高，国民收入也在不断地增长。在波兰，由于工业的迅速发展，在消费量方面已有了巨大的变化，目前波兰每人每年的肉类、脂肪和糖的消费量的增长，虽然还没有赶过西德和法国，但是却已经赶过了意大利。波兰目前正在建筑中的住宅相当于战前的两倍以上，还计划到1960年把职工的实际工资至少比六年计划最后一年提高30％。在捷克斯洛伐克，1956年的优抚金的数额已增加到1937年的十三倍以上，居民消费量增加到1953年的一倍以上。在罗马尼亚，第一个五年计划期间职工的实际工资增加28％，仅在1955年一年中，农民的收入就增加15％。德意志民主共和国1956年实行了第十七次的降低物价。
    从以上的叙述中可以看到，在社会主义制度下，人民生活变化的特点是：第一，目前这些国家中劳动人民的生活水平同革命前或解放前比较起来，是显著地提高了，这些国家或者是早已摆脱了贫穷和落后的状态，或者是正在摆脱，而走上生活富裕的道路。第二，在提高人民生活水平方面具有普遍的性质，在这些国家中，人民政府和共产党的任务就是领导全体人民建设社会主义和共产主义，大力发展国民经济，提高全体人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    怎样看资本主义国家人民生活水平
    社会主义各国人民生活水平都显著地普遍提高了，这是事实。然而，总的说来，社会主义各国人民的生活水平还没有赶上某些资本主义国家的生活水平，这也是事实。既然这样，是不是可以说资本主义制度就比社会主义制度优越呢？当然不可以。赫鲁晓夫同志曾一针见血地指出：判断资本主义条件下的居民生活水平不应当根据英国、法国和西方其他资本主义国家来判断，这些国家是靠掠夺殖民地人民发财的，必须根据亚洲、非洲和南美洲的附属国人民的生活水平来看资本主义带给人民的是什么。
    资本主义经济发展的特点，首先表现在对殖民地和附属国亿万劳动人民的残酷剥削上面。据估计，美国石油垄断组织每年从一个美国石油工人身上可以剥削到四千七百美元，从一个委内瑞拉的石油工人身上可以剥削到二万零六百美元，而从一个科威特石油工人身上则可以剥削到四万美元以上！在美国，平均每人每年的收入比印度多出三十二倍；在英国，比巴基斯坦多出十八倍；在荷兰，比印度尼西亚多出二十倍。从这些材料中可以看出，帝国主义者就是用这种损人利己的办法使自己发财致富，使别人贫困饥饿的。
    帝国主义垄断资本不仅靠剥削殖民地和附属国人民来增加自己的利润，而且靠剥削本国人民并使其破产和贫困的办法来增加自己的利润。根据美国官方材料，现在美国有三百万全失业工人，九百万半失业工人。在美国，一个四口之家维持过得去的生活，每年需要开支五千五百美元以上。但是目前美国过半数的家庭每年的收入不到五千美元，约有四分之一到三分之一的家庭每年收入不到三千美元，有十分之一的家庭甚至只有一千美元。1956年美国私人债务已高达一千六百二十七亿美元，其中大部分是分期付款赊购房屋和物品等的债务，这个数目占美国全部纳税后的个人收入的56.8％。在美国，少数垄断资本的“百万富翁俱乐部”和居住着五千六百万人的贫民窟同时存在着。美国社会的两极化，贫富的悬殊是越来越明显了。
    社会主义国家的生活水平最后一定会赶过资本主义国家
    目前，所有的社会主义国家都在大力发展自己的经济和文化，并且在各方面进行广泛的互助与合作，以便创造更好的条件来满足人民的物质和文化的需要。目前，虽然社会主义国家人民的生活还比不上某些资本主义国家，但是，社会主义国家人民生活上升的速度和提高人民福利方面的努力，却是完全可以同资本主义国家较量高低的。米高扬同志说得好：“什么地方为人民的福利做的工作更多，什么地方的生活方式更好。”社会主义国家人民完全相信，有了社会主义制度的保证和人民团结一致的努力，社会主义国家人民的生活水平也一定会赶上并超过资本主义国家的。
