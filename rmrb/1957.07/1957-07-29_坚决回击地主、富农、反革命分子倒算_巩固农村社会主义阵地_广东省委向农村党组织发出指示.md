Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 28th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a telephone conference on the 24th, demanded that all rural Party organizations in the province immediately launch a socialist propaganda and education movement among the peasants. At the same time, they should take strong measures to resolutely repulse the crimes of certain lawless landlords and rich peasants who are trying to reverse settlements with the peasants, and the destructive activities of remaining counter-revolutionaries.

The Provincial Committee pointed out that recently, in some areas, remaining counter-revolutionaries, lawless landlords, and rich peasant elements have been carrying out destructive activities, and some landlords have even been trying to reverse settlements with the peasants. Another noteworthy situation is that the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some well-to-do middle peasants have resurfaced and are expanding their influence.

In order to further consolidate the socialist position in the countryside and ensure the smooth progress of current production work, summer harvest distribution, and grain requisition and purchase, the Provincial Committee instructed all localities to implement the following four measures:

First, a universal socialist propaganda and education movement should be launched among the peasant masses. In connection with the current work, the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present should be used to strengthen class education among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Within the next few days, a general meeting or representative meeting of poor and lower-middle peasant members should be held in each cooperative to explain to them that the struggle between two roads still exists today, so that they can more consciously and resolutely take the socialist road. At the same time, in connection with their personal experiences, the superiority of cooperation and the benefits of the policy of unified purchase and supply should be publicized, and the importance of cooperatives' obedience to state plans should be explained. For the erroneous words and deeds of some well-to-do middle peasants who resist the policy of unified purchase and supply, demand excessive grain retention, and only care about themselves and not the country, and only talk about democracy and negate centralism, reasoning criticism should be carried out; those few who consciously collude with others to withdraw from the cooperative in an attempt to disintegrate the cooperative should be given strict criticism.

Second, public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels must resolutely and promptly crack down on the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries and the activities of lawless landlords and rich peasants who attempt to reverse settlements, and mobilize the masses to carry out reasoning struggles. Counter-revolutionaries and other criminal offenders who should be arrested should be arrested in accordance with the law.

Third, continue to improve the style of cadres, implement the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, do a good job in the current production work, summer harvest distribution, and grain requisition work, and promptly solve various problems that should be solved.

Fourth, strengthen rural political and ideological work. All localities can convene battlefield meetings of Party members and cadres to criticize right-leaning thoughts. The first secretary of the county party committee must personally take charge of rural ideological work; responsible cadres of the prefectural and county party committees must personally take action to investigate and study current ideological trends, make reports to the masses using vivid local facts, and immediately organize propaganda teams to go to the countryside to make reports to the peasants.

    坚决回击地主、富农、反革命分子倒算
    巩固农村社会主义阵地
    广东省委向农村党组织发出指示
    据新华社广州28日电　中共广东省委24日在电话会议上，要求全省农村党组织立即向农民展开一次社会主义宣传教育运动，同时要采取有力措施，坚决回击某些不法地主、富农向农民倒算的罪行和残余反革命分子的破坏活动。
    省委指出，最近一个时期，有些地区的残余反革命分子、不法地主、富农分子进行破坏活动，有些地主甚至向农民进行倒算。另一个值得注意的情况是，部分富裕中农的资本主义自发思想又有所抬头，而且正在扩大影响。
    为了进一步巩固农村社会主义阵地，保证当前生产工作、夏收分配和征粮购粮等工作的顺利进行，省委指示各地贯彻执行下列四项措施：
    一、普遍向农民群众展开一次社会主义宣传教育运动。要结合当前工作，运用回忆对比方法，对广大贫农、下中农加强阶级教育，在最近几天内以社为单位普遍召开一次贫农、下中农社员大会或代表会，向他们说明今天仍然存在两条道路的斗争，使他们更加自觉地坚决走社会主义的道路。同时，要结合他们的切身体验，宣传合作化的优越性和统购统销政策的好处，说明合作社服从国家计划的重要性。对于部分富裕中农抵抗统购统销政策，过高要求留粮等只顾个人、不顾国家，只讲民主、否定集中的错误言行要展开说理批判；对于其中少数有意识地串连别人退社，企图瓦解合作社的人，给以严格的批评。
    二、各级公安、检察、法院等部门要坚决及时地打击反革命分子的破坏活动和不法地主、富农的倒算活动，发动群众进行说理斗争。对于应该逮捕的反革命分子以及其他刑事犯罪分子，应该依法加以逮捕。
    三、继续改善干部作风，贯彻执行群众路线，遇事和群众商量，做好当前生产工作、夏收分配和粮食征购工作，及时解决应该解决的各项问题。
    四、加强农村政治思想工作。各地可以召开党员、干部战地会议，批判右倾思想。县委第一书记要把农村思想工作亲自抓起来；地委、县委负责干部都要亲自动手，调查研究当前思想动向，用当地生动事实向群众作报告，并且立即组织宣传队伍下乡向农民作报告。
