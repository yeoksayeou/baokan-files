Report on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue
July 9, 1957, at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress
Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai

Fellow Deputies:

The Sino-Burmese border issue is an important matter in our country's international relations, and it is also a matter of great concern to the people of our country. Therefore, the government believes it is necessary to present a special report on this issue to the National People's Congress.

Between our country and many neighboring countries, there are unresolved border issues left over from history, and the unresolved border issue between China and Burma has particularly attracted attention. This is because Britain created long-term disputes over the Sino-Burmese border issue during its rule in Burma, and in recent years, imperialist forces have frequently used the Sino-Burmese border issue to provoke relations between China and Burma, attempting to create tension.

The Chinese government has consistently advocated that all outstanding issues between our country and other countries should be resolved through peaceful negotiation to achieve a fair and reasonable solution. The Sino-Burmese border issue has a long history, and the issue itself is also very complex. Therefore, from the beginning of dealing with this issue, the government has adopted a cautious attitude, seeking a solution to this issue in a prepared and step-by-step manner.

In the initial years of our country's founding, the government needed to devote all its efforts to dealing with a series of major and urgent domestic and foreign affairs, so it was impossible to simultaneously conduct comprehensive and systematic preparations for the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue. However, since the prime ministers of China and Burma proposed in the joint communiqué of December 12, 1954, to resolve the Sino-Burmese unresolved border issue "through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time," the Chinese government has made the necessary preparations to resolve this issue. Relevant departments of the government, together with the Yunnan Provincial authorities, conducted systematic and detailed investigations and studies of relevant historical documents and actual conditions.

In November 1955, when China and Burma were actively preparing separately for the resolution of the border issue, an unfortunate armed conflict occurred between the outposts of the two countries due to misunderstanding. This incident was appropriately handled through the efforts of both China and Burma, and it also made the governments of China and Burma realize the necessity of resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue as soon as possible.

From the beginning of 1956, the governments of China and Burma began frequent contact on the Sino-Burmese border issue. In November of the same year, U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, was invited to Beijing to discuss with the Chinese government. Based on our country's peaceful diplomatic policy and the results of the investigation and research on the Sino-Burmese border issue, the Chinese government, through Chairman U Nu, put forward principled proposals to the Burmese government for resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue. The 50th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on November 5, 1956, approved this proposal.

Most of the border between China and Burma has been demarcated, but there are still three sections with unresolved issues. The Chinese government has put forward principled suggestions for these three sections of the border and believes that each point in the suggestions should be considered as a whole. Now, I will explain the content of the government's proposal.

First, regarding the section in the Wa States. The two treaties on the Sino-Burmese border signed by China and Britain in 1894 and 1897 both had explicit provisions for this section of the border. However, due to the contradictory nature of the relevant clauses, this section of the border has not been demarcated for a long time. In order to create a fait accompli, Britain dispatched troops in early 1934 to attack the areas under the jurisdiction of the Panhung and Pan Lao tribes, which was met with heroic resistance from the local Wa people. This is the famous "Panhung Incident." In 1941, taking advantage of the critical situation China faced in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Britain used the closure of the Burma Road as pressure and, in an exchange of notes with the Kuomintang government on June 18, demarcated a border in the Wa States that was unilaterally beneficial to it. This is the so-called "1941 Line." Due to the outbreak of the Pacific War shortly afterward, no boundary markers were erected on this line. In 1956, during the negotiations between the Chinese and Burmese governments on the Sino-Burmese border issue, Burmese leaders expressed their understanding of the Chinese people's dissatisfaction with the 1941 Line, but considering that this section of the border had already been demarcated by the responsible Sino-British governments through an exchange of notes, they requested the Chinese government to recognize it and also requested the Chinese troops that had entered the area west of the 1941 Line in 1952 due to the pursuit of Kuomintang remnant forces to withdraw. The Chinese government believes that in border issues, requests made based on formal treaties should be respected in accordance with general international practice, but this does not preclude the governments of two friendly countries from seeking a fair and reasonable solution that is mutually beneficial through peaceful negotiations. In order to promote such a fair and reasonable solution and to create a good atmosphere for this solution, the Chinese government expressed its willingness to withdraw Chinese troops from the area west of the 1941 Line in the principled suggestions it made to the Burmese government. At the same time, the Chinese government requested that before the Chinese and Burmese governments reach a final agreement on the 1941 Line issue and erect boundary markers, Burmese troops should not be stationed in the area west of the 1941 Line from which Chinese troops have withdrawn, but Burmese government personnel may enter this area.

Second, regarding the Meng-Mao Triangle area at the confluence of the Nam Wan River and the Shweli River, also known as the Nam Wan Triangle area, which covers an area of approximately 250 square kilometers. This area is Chinese territory, and Britain had explicitly acknowledged this in treaties in the past. However, before China and Britain signed the treaty on the Sino-Burmese border in 1894, Britain forcibly built the Bhamo-Namhkam highway through this area without China's consent. In 1897, when China and Britain signed another treaty on the Sino-Burmese border, Britain obtained jurisdiction over this piece of Chinese territory in the name of "perpetual lease." After Burma's independence, it inherited the "perpetual lease" relationship over this area. In the principled suggestions made to the Burmese government, the Chinese government pointed out that it is incompatible with the current equal and friendly relations between China and Burma for Burma to continue to maintain a "perpetual lease" relationship over a piece of Chinese territory. The Chinese government expressed its willingness to discuss with the Burmese government the specific steps on how to abolish the "perpetual lease" relationship over the Meng-Mao Triangle area.

Third, regarding the section north of Hkakabo Razi. This section of the border has never been demarcated in the past. Britain had constantly created disputes in this area, taking the opportunity to expand its colonial territory. The most serious was the armed occupation of the Pianma area by Britain in early 1911. The "Pianma Incident" aroused righteous indignation among the Chinese people, and protest movements surged across the country. Under these circumstances, the British government had no choice but to formally acknowledge in a note to the Chinese government on April 10, 1911, that the villages of Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang belonged to China, but it continued to occupy this area unreasonably. Based on the results of the investigation and research on historical facts and actual conditions, the Chinese government made the following suggestions to the Burmese government regarding the demarcation of this section of the border: the section from the Isu Razi Pass north to the Diphu Pass can be demarcated according to the customary border line; the section from the Isu Razi Pass to Hkakabo Razi, in addition to the return of the Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang areas to China, the border can in principle be demarcated by the watershed between the Nujiang River, the Shweli River (also known as the Longchuan River), and the Taiping River on one side and the N'mai River on the other. The Chinese government also requested that at the same time that Chinese troops withdraw from the area west of the 1941 Line, the Burmese government also withdraw its troops from Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang. Before the final demarcation of this section, the Burmese government may retain administrative control in the Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang areas, and the Chinese government guarantees that Chinese troops will not be stationed in this area before the final demarcation of this section of the border.

After the Chinese government put forward the above suggestions, Chairman U Nu expressed that these were fair and reasonable suggestions that took into account the interests of both sides. The joint press communiqué issued after Chairman U Nu's meeting with the leaders of the Chinese government also announced that the Chinese and Burmese governments had reached an understanding that from the end of November 1956 to the end of 1956, Chinese troops would withdraw from the area west of the 1941 Line, and Burmese troops would withdraw from Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang. Before the end of 1956, the Chinese and Burmese governments completed the troop withdrawal work separately. This provided a good start for the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue. Last December in Rangoon and this March in Kunming, the leaders of the Chinese and Burmese governments had the opportunity to continue friendly discussions on the border issue between the two countries, further clarifying each other's views and reaching a consensus on the general aspects.

People from all walks of life are concerned about the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue. In order to widely solicit opinions from various domestic parties, I, on behalf of the government, made a report on the Sino-Burmese border issue to the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in mid-March this year. NPC deputies, government members, and invited experts in Beijing also attended that meeting. At the end of March this year, I also made a report on the Sino-Burmese border issue in Kunming to a meeting convened by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended by representatives from all sectors and ethnic groups in Yunnan Province. At these two meetings with broad representation, enthusiastic discussions were held, giving the government the opportunity to listen to opinions from all parties and answer questions on relevant issues, which further unified the views of all parties in the country on the Sino-Burmese border issue.

The above is a general account of the Chinese government's handling of the Sino-Burmese border issue up to now. Now, I would like to explain the basic policy that the government follows in handling the Sino-Burmese border issue.

Since the founding of our country, the policy that we have consistently pursued in international affairs has been to strive for the easing of the world situation and to strive for peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world, especially with our neighboring countries. This policy is conducive to our country's socialist construction and is also in line with the interests of the people of all countries in the world. The Chinese government's approach to the Sino-Burmese border issue is also based on this basic policy of peaceful diplomacy.

The border issue between China and Burma, like many outstanding issues between other Asian and African countries, is caused by the long-term policy of aggression by imperialism. Now, both China and Burma have achieved independence and are working hard to strive for a peaceful international environment for their respective peaceful construction. China and Burma are also the countries that first advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence together with India. We all cherish our national independence and national interests, and we all deeply realize that only through peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation can we better safeguard our respective national independence and national interests. However, imperialists have never stopped using the differences between Asian and African countries to create tension and discord between these countries, making every effort to re-implement the policy of "divide and rule" against these countries. In response to this situation, the Chinese government, in its discussions with the Burmese government on the Sino-Burmese border issue, has always emphasized sincerity, friendly consultation in accordance with the Five Principles, and seeking a fair and reasonable solution. In this way, the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue will not only further consolidate and develop the friendly relations between China and Burma but will also be conducive to the unity of Asian and African countries. The Chinese government's position in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue is based on safeguarding our country's national interests and also on promoting Sino-Burmese friendship and the interests of the unity of Asian and African countries.

The Sino-Burmese border issue has a complex historical background. Therefore, how to treat historical materials has become an important issue in dealing with the Sino-Burmese border issue. During the feudal dynasties in China, just like many countries in the feudal era, the boundaries of the four directions were not very clear. The relations between the Chinese feudal dynasties and the various ethnic groups in the border areas also had different natures and degrees. Therefore, it is almost impossible to determine the boundary line of the Chinese feudal empire. On the other hand, in the past sixty years, many very different ways of drawing the Sino-Burmese unresolved border have appeared in maps published at home and abroad. These situations cannot but have caused confusion about the Sino-Burmese unresolved border on a wide scale. The government believes that in dealing with the Sino-Burmese border issue, it is necessary to seriously treat historical materials, to conduct scientific analysis and judgment of historical materials with a correct position and point of view, and to distinguish between historical materials that can be used as legal basis and historical materials that are only of reference value due to changes in circumstances. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the fundamental changes of historical significance that have taken place in China and Burma, that is, China and Burma have been freed from their original semi-colonial and colonial status, respectively, and have become independent and mutually friendly countries. The Burmese government inherited the areas originally ruled by Britain, and autonomous states of different ethnic groups and mainland Burma formed the Union of Burma. The Chinese government took over the areas governed by the Kuomintang government. In dealing with the Sino-Burmese border issue, attention must be paid to these historical changes, and past treaties related to the Sino-Burmese border must be treated in accordance with general international practice. Only by considering the above points in combination can we correctly use historical materials and seek a fair and reasonable solution to the Sino-Burmese border issue.

The Sino-Burmese border issue is directly related to the interests of the various ethnic groups living in the Sino-Burmese border area. Therefore, in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue, it is particularly necessary to take care of the interests of these ethnic groups. We know that it is common for the border between two countries to divide the same ethnic group living in the border area into two. This is the result of historical development. In the demarcated sections of the Sino-Burmese border, and on the borders between our country and many other neighboring countries, we can see the situation where the same ethnic group lives on both sides of the border. We must anticipate in advance when resolving the Sino-Burmese unresolved border issue that it is difficult to avoid the separation of the ethnic groups concerned by the boundary line. In view of this situation, we need to consult with the Burmese government to take measures to make the future boundary a peaceful and friendly boundary and to further develop the close ties between the border residents of the two countries.

Fellow Deputies, after the governments of China and Burma have conducted many contacts and discussions on the Sino-Burmese border issue in the spirit of friendship and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, they have reached a consensus on the general aspects. We believe that through continued consultation and coordination of the opinions of both sides on specific issues, the Sino-Burmese border issue will be comprehensively and fairly resolved.

    关于中缅边界问题的报告
    1957年7月9日在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上
    国务院总理兼外交部长　周恩来各位代表：
    中缅边界问题是我国在国际关系方面的一个重要问题，同时也是我国人民很关心的一个问题。因此，政府认为有必要就这个问题向全国人民代表大会作专门报告。
    在我国和许多邻国之间，都存在着历史上遗留下来的未定界问题，而中缅两国之间的未定界问题特别引起人们的注意。这是由于英国在过去统治缅甸的时期在中缅边界问题上制造了长期的纠纷，而近几年来，帝国主义势力又经常利用中缅边界问题，挑拨中缅关系，企图造成紧张局势。
    我国政府一贯主张，我国和其他国家之间所有悬而未决的问题，都应该通过和平协商的途径，求得公平合理的解决。中缅边界问题由来已久，问题本身也很复杂，因此，政府从着手处理这个问题的时候起，就采取了审慎从事的态度，有准备、有步骤地寻求这个问题的解决。
    在我们国家成立的最初几年，政府需要把全部力量用来处理国内国外一系列重大而迫切的事务，因此不可能同时为中缅边界问题的解决进行全面的和有系统的准备工作。但是，自从中缅两国总理在1954年12月12日的会谈公报中提出“在适当时机内，通过正常的外交途径”解决中缅未定界问题以后，我国政府就为解决这个问题进行必要的准备。政府的各有关部门会同云南省当局，对有关的历史文献和实际情况进行了系统的和详细的调查研究。
    在1955年11月，当中缅双方为边界问题的解决分别地积极进行准备的时候，在两国的边境上，双方的前哨部队由于误会曾经发生过一次不幸的武装冲突事件。这次事件，经过中缅双方的努力，得到了适当的处理，同时也使中缅两国政府体会到及早解决中缅边界问题的必要。
    从1956年年初起，中缅两国政府就中缅边界问题开始了频繁的接触。同年11月，缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟吴努主席应邀来北京同我国政府商谈。我国政府根据我国的和平外交政策和对中缅边界问题调查研究的结果，通过吴努主席向缅甸政府提出了解决中缅边界问题的原则性建议。1956年11月5日全国人民代表大会常务委员会的第五十次会议同意了这项建议。
    中缅两国的边界大部分已经划定，但是有三段还存在着未决问题。我国政府针对这三段边界提出了原则性的建议，并且认为建议中的各点应该作为一个整体联系起来加以考虑。现在，我说明一下政府提出的这项建议的内容。
    第一是关于在佧佤山区的一段。中英两国在1894年和1897年签订的两个关于中缅边界的条约中，对于这一段边界都曾经有明文规定。但是，由于有关的条文自相矛盾，这一段边界长期没有划定。为了造成既成事实，英国在1934年初派遣军队进攻班洪部落和班老部落所管辖的地区，遭到了当地佧佤族人民的英勇抵抗，这就是有名的“班洪事件”。1941年，英国乘当时中国在抗日战争中所面临的危急情况，以封闭滇缅公路作为压力，同国民党政府于6月18日用换文的方式在佧佤山区划定了一条对它片面有利的边界。这就是所谓“1941年线”。由于不久就发生了太平洋战争，在这条线上并没有树立界桩。1956年，在中缅两国政府就中缅边界问题进行商谈的过程中，缅甸的领导人员曾经表示能够理解中国人民对于1941年线的不满情绪，但是鉴于这段边界已经通过当时负责的中英政府以换文划定，因此要求我国政府予以承认，并且要求我国政府把在1952年由于追剿国民党残余部队而进入1941年线以西地区的中国军队撤回。我国政府认为，在边界问题上，根据正式条约而提出来的要求，应该按照一般国际惯例予以尊重，但是这并不排除两个友好国家的政府通过和平商谈求得对双方都是公平合理的解决。为了促进这种公平合理的解决，为了替这种解决创造良好的气氛，我国政府在向缅甸政府提出的原则性建议中表示准备把中国军队撤出1941年线以西的地区。同时，我国政府要求，在中缅两国政府没有对1941年线问题取得最后协议并且树立界桩以前，缅甸军队不进驻中国军队自1941年线以西所撤出的地区，但是缅甸政府的工作人员可以进入这一地区。
    第二是关于在南碗河和瑞丽江汇合处的猛卯三角地区，又名南碗三角地区，面积约二百五十平方公里。这个地区是中国的领土，过去英国在条约中也明文承认了这一点。但是，在1894年中英两国签订有关中缅边界的条约以前，英国就不经中国的同意，强行通过这个地区兴修由八莫到南坎的公路。到1897年，中英两国再一次签订有关中缅边界条约的时候，英国又以“永租”的名义取得了对中国的这块领土的管辖权。缅甸独立以后承继了对这个地区的“永租”关系。我国政府在向缅甸政府提出的原则性建议中指出，由缅甸继续对中国的一块领土保持“永租”的关系，是同中缅两国目前的平等友好关系不相称的。我国政府表示愿意同缅甸政府商定如何废除对猛卯三角地“永租”关系的具体步骤。
    第三是关于尖高山以北的一段。这一段边界过去始终没有划定。英国曾经在这个地区不断地制造纠纷，借机扩大它的殖民领域。最严重的就是1911年初英国对片马地区的武装侵占。“片马事件”激起了全中国人民的义愤，全国各地都掀起了风起云涌的抗议运动。在这种情况下，英国政府也不得不在1911年4月10日给当时中国政府的照会中正式承认，片马、岗房、古浪三处各寨是属于中国的，但是却毫无道理地继续侵占这个地区。根据对历史事实和实际情况进行调查研究的结果，我国政府对于这一段边界的划定，向缅甸政府提出以下的建议：从伊索拉希山口以北到底富山口的部分，可以按照习惯边界线划界；从伊索拉希山口到尖高山的一段，除片马、岗房、古浪地区应该归还中国以外，原则上可以按怒江、瑞丽江（又名龙川江）、太平江为一方和恩梅开江为另一方的分水岭划定边界。我国政府同时要求，在中国军队撤出1941年线以西地区的同一时期内，缅甸政府也把军队从片马、岗房、古浪撤出。在这一段最后划界以前，缅甸政府可以保留在片马、岗房、古浪地区的行政管理，而中国政府保证，在这一段边界最后划定以前，中国军队将不进驻这个地区。
    在我国政府提出了以上的建议以后，吴努主席表示这是照顾双方利益的公平合理的建议。在吴努主席同我国政府领导人员会谈后发表的联合新闻公报中又宣布，中缅两国政府取得谅解，从1956年11月底到1956年年底，中国军队撤出1941年线以西地区，缅甸军队撤出片马、岗房、古浪。在1956年年底以前，中缅两国政府分别完成了撤军的工作。这就为中缅边界问题的解决提供了一个良好的开端。去年12月在仰光和今年3月在昆明，中缅两国政府的领导人员又有机会对两国边界问题继续进行友好的商谈，进一步澄清了彼此的观点，在总的方面取得了一致的意见。
    全国各界人士都很关心中缅边界问题的解决。为了广泛地征求国内各方面的意见，我曾经代表政府在今年3月中旬向中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议作了关于中缅边界问题的报告。在北京的人大代表、政府成员和特邀的专家也出席了那次会议。今年3月底，我又在昆明向政治协商会议云南省委员会召集的由云南省各界和各兄弟民族代表参加的会议作了关于中缅边界问题的报告。在这两次具有广泛代表性的会议上，都展开了热烈的讨论，使政府有机会听取各方面的意见，并且对有关问题作了解答，这就进一步统一了全国各方面在中缅边界问题上的看法。
    以上是我国政府到目前为止处理中缅边界问题的大致经过。现在，我要说明一下政府在处理中缅边界问题中所遵循的基本政策。
    我们的国家自从开国以来在国际事务中一贯奉行的政策，就是争取世界局势的和缓，争取同世界各国、特别是同我们的邻国和平共处。这个政策有利于我们国家的社会主义建设，也符合于世界各国人民的利益。我国政府在处理中缅边界问题时所根据的，也正是这个基本的和平外交政策。
    中缅两国之间的边界问题，正像其他亚非国家之间的许多悬而未决的问题一样，都是帝国主义长期侵略政策所造成的。现在，中缅两国都已经取得独立，都在努力为本国的和平建设争取一个和平的国际环境。中缅两国又是同印度一起首先倡议和平共处五项原则的国家，我们都珍视自己的民族独立和民族利益，我们都深刻地认识到，只有通过和平共处和友好合作，才能更好地维护我们各自的民族独立和民族利益。但是，帝国主义者却从来没有停止利用亚非国家的分歧在这些国家之间制造紧张和不和，竭力企图重新对这些国家实行“分而治之”的侵略政策。针对这样的情况，我国政府在同缅甸政府商谈中缅边界问题的过程中，一向强调双方相见以诚，按照五项原则友好协商，求得一个公平合理的解决。这样，中缅边界问题的解决，不仅会使中缅两国的友好关系得到进一步的巩固和发展，而且还将有利于亚非国家的团结。我国政府在解决中缅边界问题上所采取的立场，是从维护我国的民族利益出发的，同时也是从促进中缅友谊和亚非各国团结的利益出发的。
    中缅边界问题有复杂的历史背景。因此，在处理中缅边界问题的时候如何对待历史资料，就成为一个重要的问题。中国在封建王朝统治时期，正像封建时代的许多国家一样，四至疆界是不十分明确的。中国历代的封建王朝同边沿地区各个民族的关系也有各种性质和程度的不同。因此，要确定中国封建帝国的疆界线，几乎是不可能的。另一方面，近六十多年来，国内和国外出版的地图中，先后出现了对中缅未定界的许多很不同的画法。这些情况不能不在广大的范围内引起了对中缅未定界的混乱看法。政府认为，在处理中缅边界问题的时候，必须认真地对待历史资料，必须以正确的立场和观点对历史资料进行科学的分析和判断，把可以作为法理依据的历史资料同由于情况变化只有参考价值的历史资料加以区别。同时，更要注意到中缅两国已经发生的具有历史意义的根本变化，那就是，中国和缅甸已经分别摆脱了原来的半殖民地和殖民地的地位，成为独立的和互相友好的国家。缅甸政府继承了原来受英国统治的地区，不同民族的自治邦同缅甸本部组成了缅甸联邦。我国政府接管了国民党政府所管辖的地区。在处理中缅边界问题的时候，必须注意到这些历史变化，同时也要按照一般国际惯例来对待过去签订的有关中缅边界的条约。只有把以上各点结合起来考虑，才能够正确地运用历史资料，求得中缅边界问题的公平合理的解决。
    中缅边界问题直接地关系到聚居在中缅边境的各民族的利益。因此，在解决中缅边界问题的时候，就特别需要照顾这些民族的利益。我们知道，两国之间的边界把聚居在边境的同一民族划分为二，是常见的事。这是历史发展的结果。在中缅已定界的各段，在我国和许多其他邻国的边界上，我们都可以看到同一个民族分居边界两旁的情况。我们在解决中缅未定界问题的时候必须事先估计到，有关民族被边界线分隔是难以避免的。鉴于这种情况，我们就更加需要同缅甸政府协商采取措施，使将来划定的边界成为和平友好的边界，进一步发展两国边民之间的亲密联系。
    各位代表，中缅两国政府根据友好的精神和和平共处的五项原则，对中缅边界问题进行了多次的接触和商谈以后，已经在总的方面取得一致意见。我们相信，通过继续的协商，把双方在具体问题上的意见加以协调以后，中缅边界问题就将得到全面的和公平合理的解决。
