　　Wuhan, July 28th (Reported by our correspondent Gu Weijin) Following instructions from the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei Province's rural areas have begun to closely integrate with current production, conduct socialist education for all peasants in the province, and mobilize the masses to thoroughly and resolutely expose and counter the words and deeds of a few illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries attempting to restore and reverse the verdicts.

　　Since the small anti-Communist, anti-socialist typhoon of the right-wing elements in the cities blew into the rural areas of Hubei Province, some illegal landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, attack cadres and the masses, and attempt to destroy the cooperatives. A landlord in Fenghuang Township, Wuchang County, after seeing the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements, said everywhere: "The time has come, we are going to be liberated." He also refused to pay the eighteen yuan of share funds he owed to the cooperative. Lin Jinlong, who had served as a puppet platoon leader in Qingtan Township (returned to his hometown after completing his labor reform term), openly said to the masses: "The Communist Party is going to collapse, and the Kuomintang is coming!" And secretly held meetings, planning to murder the township head, the Party branch secretary, and other township cadres. A rich peasant element in Guanquan No. 1 Cooperative of Guanbu Township, Xianning County, openly shouted among the masses, "The cooperative is my mortal enemy, I must destroy the cooperative."

　　Under the instigation of the reactionary words and deeds of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, a few well-to-do middle peasants who were resistant to the cooperatives took the opportunity to attack the cooperatives. An old upper-middle peasant in Songzi County, in order to incite the members to withdraw from the cooperative, spread rumors saying, "The cooperative has already established a withdrawal office." Li Jiyuan, an old upper-middle peasant (individual household) in Chashi Township of the same county, had not handed in public grain or sold surplus grain for two years. Recently, he colluded with eighteen peasant households and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Overthrow the cooperative" at the gate of the branch secretary. When the branch secretary criticized his behavior as wrong, he beat and pushed the branch secretary into the pond (the county has decided to punish Li Jiyuan according to law). In some places, there have also been incidents of a few old upper-middle peasants making trouble and withdrawing from the cooperative.

　　After the Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province carried out class education with the anti-rightist struggle as the main content in the rural areas, the above situation has begun to turn around.

　　When Xiantai Cooperative in Dushan Township, Echeng County, held a meeting to expose the fallacies of bad elements, everyone used the fact that the cooperative director worked diligently for the cooperative and that the members were paid according to their work to refute a landlord surnamed Li's fallacy that the cooperative director was a slave owner and the members were slaves, and also exposed his ugly deeds as a puppet Baozhang in the past. This landlord had to lower his head and confess his guilt. Some landlords and rich peasants in Putuan Township used to praise Ge Peiqi's reactionary remarks, but now, at the anti-rightist struggle forum, everyone used the fact that their lives had improved to criticize this fallacy.

　　With the improvement of the masses' awareness, they all proposed to answer the bad elements' attacks by doing a good job in production. After the three townships of Zhuposi, Fanggaoping, and Xue'ao in Huanggang County held meetings to refute the bad elements' fallacies, they immediately explored the potential for increased production, deciding to increase grain production by 880,000 jin. Gongqing Cooperative in Qingtan Township, Wuchang County, found a 30% shortage of fertilizer, and six production teams worked overnight to accumulate fertilizer. The two hundred and twenty mu of soybeans in Huoxing Cooperative were originally scheduled to be harvested on the 20th, but in order to seize the opportunity for replanting, the soybeans were harvested on the 17th.

    湖北农民开始说理斗争
    地主富农休想倒算
    本报武汉28日电　记者古维进报道：根据中共湖北省委指示，湖北省农村开始密切结合当前生产，向全省农民进行社会主义教育，同时发动群众对少数不法地主、富农和反革命分子妄图复辟倒算的言行，给以彻底的坚决的揭发和回击。
    自城市右派分子反共、反社会主义的小台风吹到湖北省农村之后，某些不法地主富农和反革命分子趁机造谣破坏，打击干部、群众，企图把合作社搞垮。武昌县凤凰乡有一个地主看到右派分子的反动言论后，到处说：“时机到了，我们要解放了。”他拖欠社里的十八元股分基金也拒绝不交。清潭乡曾当过伪连长的林金龙（劳改期满后回乡的）竟明目张胆向群众说：“共产党要垮台了，国民党就要到了！”并且秘密开会，策划谋杀乡长和党支部书记和乡干部等。咸宁县官埠乡官泉一社一个富农分子公开地在群众中叫嚷“合作社是他的死对头，非搞垮合作社不可。”
    在地主富农和反革命分子的反动言行的蛊惑下，少数对合作社有抵触思想的富裕中农，趁机攻击合作社。松滋县一个老上中农为了煽动社员退社，造谣说：“社里已经成立了退社办公室”，这个县的茶市乡老上中农李继元（单干户）有两年没交公粮、没卖余粮了，最近他串连了十八户农民到支部书记门口叫喊“推翻合作社”等反动口号，支部书记批评他的行为不对时，他连打带推把支部书记弄到塘里去了（县里已决定依法惩办李继元）。有些地方，还发生少数老上中农闹社和退社的事情。
    湖北省各级党委在农村中进行以反右派斗争为主要内容的阶级教育以后，上述情况已经在开始扭转。
    鄂城县杜山乡先台社开会揭露坏分子的谬论时，大家以社主任勤勤恳恳为社工作，和社员按劳取酬的事实驳斥了一个姓李的地主说社主任是奴隶主、社员是奴隶的谬论，还揭露他过去当伪保长的丑恶事迹。这个地主不得不低头认罪。浦团乡曾经有些地主富农对葛佩琦的反动言论口口声声称好，现在在反右派斗争座谈会上，大家以生活提高的事实批驳了这种谬论。
    随着群众觉悟的提高，他们都提出以搞好生产回答坏分子的进攻。黄冈县竹坡寺、方高坪、薛坳三个乡集会驳斥坏分子的谬论后，随即挖掘增产潜力；决定增产粮食八十八万斤。武昌县清潭乡共青社发现缺肥30％，六个生产队连夜突击积肥。火星社的二百二十亩黄豆原定20日割完，但为了抓紧复播，17日就把黄豆割完。
