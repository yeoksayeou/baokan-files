Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 30th: On the evening of the second day of the festival, the Chinese youth delegation and the youth of the Proletarian District of Moscow held a joint celebration.

    At seven o'clock, when the car carrying the Chinese youth representatives drove into the garden of the Likhachev Automobile Factory Cultural Palace, the Soviet youth who had been waiting for a long time applauded and welcomed them on both sides of the road. After getting out of the car, the young women of the two countries embraced each other, and the Soviet youth presented the Chinese youth with freshly cultivated flowers and white doves. The Chinese and Soviet youth were filled with a warm atmosphere of friendship.

    At eight o'clock, the celebration officially began. Yenichev, secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Likhachev Automobile Factory, said in his speech: The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is unbreakable, and this friendship is not just a smile, but a sincere mutual support and help. When Ogalova, a fourth-grade student of the Fourth Hundred Ninety-Fourth Elementary School in the Proletarian District, presented flowers on behalf of the Young Pioneers, she recited a poem:
    We all know there is a word every
    morning we wake up with it.
    This word, everyone knows,
    needs no translation,
    needs no dictionary,
    This is "Friendship."
    The audience immediately shouted "Friendship! Friendship!"

    Zhou Shixian, a Chinese youth representative and deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, paid tribute to the youth of the Proletarian District on behalf of the Chinese youth delegation. He also presented gifts from the youth of the eastern suburbs of Beijing to the Proletarian District: a violin made by the youth of the musical instrument factory, women's shirts and embroidered tablecloths sewn by the girls of the eastern suburbs, Chinese wine, and a Chinese-made radio, etc. The audience shouted "Moscow-Beijing" again and again.

    Then the youth of the Proletarian District presented gifts to the Chinese youth: dolls of the fifteen Soviet republics, sewn by the girls of the Gisiski Textile Factory with brightly colored floral cloth, a small boat made by the youth of the Southern Electric Factory, commemorative albums, lacquerware, etc. The audience once again shouted "Peace! Friendship!"

    After the meeting, the youth of the two countries performed wonderful programs. The "Flower Drum Lantern" and other programs performed by the Chinese Youth Art Troupe were warmly welcomed by the audience. The celebration ended at midnight. (Attached picture)

    中苏青年欢度友谊之夜
    共同表演节目　互相赠送礼品
    本报莫斯科30日电　联欢节第二天的傍晚，中国青年代表团和莫斯科无产阶级区的青年举行了联欢。
    七点，载着中国青年代表的汽车开进了李哈乔夫汽车厂文化宫花园时，等候已久的苏联青年们夹道鼓掌欢迎。下车后，两国女青年们拥抱起来，苏联青年把亲手培植的鲜花和白鸽子献给中国青年。中苏青年洋溢在热烈的友爱气氛中。
    八时，联欢会正式开始。李哈乔夫汽车工厂团委书记叶尼契夫讲话，他说：苏中人民的友谊是牢不可破的，这种友谊不是微笑，而是衷心地相互支持和帮助。当无产阶级区第四百九十四小学四年级学生奥加略娃代表少先队献花时，她念了一首诗：
    我们都知道有一个字每天清
    早和它一起醒来。
    这个字，谁都知道，
    不必翻译，
    不必查字典，
    这就是“友谊”。
    全场立刻高呼“友谊！友谊！”
    中国青年代表、北京团市委副书记周士贤代表中国青年代表团向无产阶级区青年致敬。他又代表北京东郊区的青年向无产阶级区赠送了礼物：乐器厂青年做的一把提琴，东郊区姑娘们缝制的女衬衣、绣花桌布、中国酒和中国自制的收音机等等。全场一遍又一遍的高呼，莫斯科—北京
    接着无产阶级区青年向中国青年献礼：吉西斯基纺织厂姑娘们亲手用鲜艳的花布缝制的苏联十五个共和国的洋娃娃，南方电器厂青年亲手做的一只小轮船、纪念册、漆器等等，全场又一次高呼“和平！友谊！”
    会后两国青年表演了精彩节目。中国青年艺术团演出的“花鼓灯”等节目受到全场一致热烈的欢迎。联欢直到子夜结束。（附图片）
