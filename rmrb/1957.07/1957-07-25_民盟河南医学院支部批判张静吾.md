    China Democratic League Henan Medical College Branch Criticizes Zhang Jingwu

    (Our newspaper reports) According to the Henan Daily, the China Democratic League Henan Medical College Branch recently held a series of enlarged meetings of all its members to criticize Zhang Jingwu, member of the China Democratic League Henan Provincial Committee and Vice President of Henan Medical College, for his anti-Communist and anti-socialist reactionary remarks.

    Not long ago, at a forum for intellectuals convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Zhang Jingwu used the excuse that "the leaders of the Communist Party in the schools now do not understand the profession and have a low cultural level" to put forward the idea of so-called "democratic school management." He slandered the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals and negated the achievements of all political and ideological movements. He said: "A series of movements have used students to struggle against teachers, nurses to struggle against doctors, and young people to struggle against the elderly. As a result, doctors who have been struggled against dare not direct nurses, and teachers are very afraid to lecture to students." His anti-Party remarks received sympathy from some intellectuals. But after people studied several editorials in the "People's Daily," especially the documents such as Chairman Mao's speech, they all drew a clear line with the right-wing elements and actively criticized Zhang Jingwu.

    In the criticism, the majority of teachers agreed that Zhang Jingwu's reactionary remarks were with ulterior motives. Many teachers pointed out in their speeches that the essence of Zhang Jingwu's "democratic school management" was to abolish the leadership of the Party. Associate Professor Xu Tongqing and Professor Sun Shengui both pointed out that only the leadership of the Communist Party can run the school well, and if the school loses the leadership of the Party, it will drag the school back to the bourgeois road. Many teachers also refuted Zhang Jingwu's erroneous assessment of a series of political movements, and Zhang Jingwu's statement that teachers at the medical college are generally passive is not in line with the facts. Many other teachers continued to expose a lot of Zhang Jingwu's reactionary remarks. They unanimously demanded that Zhang Jingwu honestly confess, thoroughly examine himself, and not cut himself off from the people.

### 民盟河南医学院支部批判张静吾

    民盟河南医学院支部批判张静吾
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：民盟河南医学院支部，近日连续召开了全体盟员扩大会议，批判民盟河南省委委员、河南医学院副院长张静吾的反共、反社会主义的反动言论。
    不久前在中共河南省委和民盟河南省委召开的知识分子座谈会上，张静吾以“现在学校共产党的领导人不懂业务，文化水平不高”为借口，提出所谓“民主办校”的主张。他诬蔑党对知识分子的思想改造政策，否定一切政治思想运动的成绩。他说：“一系列的运动都是利用学生斗老师、利用护士斗医生、利用青年斗老年。因此被斗过的医师不敢指挥护士，教师对学生讲课也很骇怕。”他的反党言论曾得到一些知识分子的同情。但当人们学习了“人民日报”的几篇社论，特别是学习了毛主席的讲话等文件后，都先后与右派分子划清了界限，积极批判张静吾。
    在批判中，广大教师一致认为张静吾的反动言论是别有用心的。许多教师发言指出张静吾的“民主办校”实质上是要取消党的领导。徐同青副教授和孙生桂教授都指出，只有共产党领导才能办好学校，学校失掉党的领导就会把学校拉回资产阶级路上去。许多教师还批驳了张静吾对一系列政治运动的错误估价问题，张静吾说医学院教师普遍消极是不符合事实的。还有不少教师继续揭发了张静吾的很多反动言论。他们一致要求张静吾要老实交代，彻底检查，不要自绝于人民。
