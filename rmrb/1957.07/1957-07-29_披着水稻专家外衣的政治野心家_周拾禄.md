    Political Ambitionist in the Guise of a Rice Expert - Zhou Shilu
    The anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracy of Zhou Shilu, the vice-director of the East China Agricultural Science Institute, who was cloaked in the guise of the nation's leading rice expert, has been exposed.
    Zhou Shilu is a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and also the vice-chairman of the Nanjing branch of this society. When the Communist Party Group of the Agricultural Science Institute proposed a preliminary list of members for the Rectification Study Committee and consulted with non-Party leaders such as Zhou Shilu, Zhou seized this opportunity, exploited some people's dissatisfaction with individual Party members, and demanded that the Party Group agree to adopt a "popular election" method. As a result, Zhou Shilu usurped the position of chairman of this committee.
    Thus, Zhou Shilu became dizzy with success. He personally wrote a "summary of the first mobilization report after the establishment of the Study Committee". In the "mobilization report", Zhou Shilu blatantly declared that the "Study Committee" "does not belong to the leadership of the Party, nor does it belong to the administrative leadership". He also wanted to establish three groups for counter-revolution suppression work, institutional personnel, and living welfare, to "organize forces, study problems, put forward suggestions, and let the Party and administration implement them". Moreover, he stipulated that the task of the counter-revolution suppression work group was: "to study the problems existing in the movements of counter-revolution suppression, the 'three-anti', and the 'anti-suppression', and put forward solutions. Those who should be rehabilitated should be rehabilitated, those who should admit mistakes should admit mistakes, those who should confess should confess, and those who should be concluded should be concluded."
    In this "mobilization report," Zhou Shilu also proposed "democratic elections to re-elect the group leaders." He said, "During the 'airing' and 'contending' period, Party member comrades should withdraw from the current study groups to facilitate exposure and criticism." As a result, most of the Party member group leaders in the study groups were squeezed out. Zhou Shilu further appointed his confidant Ren Chengxian (a member of the Jiusan Society) to control the blackboard bulletin and big-character posters, directing the blackboard bulletin editors to conduct interviews and appointing new "Study Committee editors". Under his guidance, these propaganda tools were all put into motion to scold Communist Party members for "committing all kinds of evil" and to demand that Communist Party members "regret what they did in the past". One big-character poster openly accused the five Party member leaders of the institute, saying, "If you don't stand up, we will bury you along with the three major isms."
    Zhou Shilu was not satisfied with usurping the leadership of the rectification movement within the institute. He also promoted the experience of establishing a "Study Committee" without Party leadership in the institute to the heads of various branches of the Nanjing branch of the Jiusan Society.
    Zhou Shilu's confidant, Jiang Yao, the head of the Agricultural Implements Department, also actively attacked the Party in accordance with Zhou Shilu's intentions. He arranged a vicious plan to struggle against Party members, preparing to struggle against this Party member today and that Party member tomorrow. Someone in this department incited a small number of workers to post big-character posters against Party member Lin Tiqiang going to the factory to improve the rice transplanter. Some people also posted a reactionary "Ten Demands," putting forward reactionary slogans such as "expand democratic rights, hand over all the power of the institute to the institute representative assembly, and elect the director of the institute," "reorganize the Party group," and "disclose personnel materials." The initiator of the "Ten Demands" had shown the original draft to Zhou Shilu beforehand. Zhou Shilu also suggested that the initiator add the phrase "Those who agree, please sign" to the end of the "Ten Demands." In this way, he launched this inflammatory signature campaign against the leadership of the Party and the government over academic institutions and the power to appoint leaders of academic institutions.
    Although Zhou Shilu had made some achievements in the study of rice cultivation in his early years, this scientist has not published any academic papers in the past twenty years. Zhou Shilu not only did not study science himself, but he also arranged for his confidants to suppress and attack those Party members who actively studied and delved into their professional work in every possible way. When Communist Party member Li Zhaosen achieved preliminary results in researching a wind-powered tiller in 1950, the East China Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau sent him to the East China Agricultural Science Institute to continue further research. Zhou Shilu fabricated some "theories" to obstruct him and colluded with Jiang Yao to consistently refuse to include the work in the department's research plan. Later, it was discovered by the director Liu Chun'an and was re-included in the plan. In actual work, Jiang Yao would not allow factory workers to manufacture parts for the wind-powered tiller, thereby obstructing Li Zhaosen's research. Li Zhaosen had no choice but to personally go to the factory to operate and manufacture parts. Before the wind-powered tiller was tested in the suburbs of Nanjing in 1953, Jiang Yao secretly instigated his confidant Sun Yiqing to secretly sabotage his work. In this way, Comrade Li Zhaosen was finally forced to leave the Agricultural Science Institute. He continued to engage in research in a new job and officially tested successfully this year (see this newspaper's March 4th news).
    In the past month, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has launched several rounds of large-scale debates. The vast majority of scientific researchers and staff members have exposed and criticized the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Zhou Shilu and others. Although Zhou Shilu has admitted that he has made mistakes in being anti-Communist and anti-socialist, he is still unwilling to confess the specific facts. The anti-rightist struggle in the institute is developing in depth.

### 披着水稻专家外衣的政治野心家——周拾禄

    披着水稻专家外衣的政治野心家——周拾禄
    披着全国第一流水稻专家外衣的华东农业科学研究所副所长周拾禄的反共、反社会主义的阴谋已经被揭露了。
    周拾禄是九三学社的中央委员，又是这个学社南京分社的副主任委员。当农业科学研究所中共党组提出整风学习委员会的初步名单同周拾禄等党外负责人商量的时候，周拾禄便抓住这个机会，利用某些群众对个别党员不满的心理，要求党组同意采用“民选”方式，结果周拾禄篡夺了这个委员会的主任委员职权。
    这样，周拾禄就得意忘形了。他亲手写好一个学习委员会成立之后“第一次动员报告内容概要”。周拾禄在“动员报告”中明目张胆地宣称：“学习委员会”“不属于党领导，亦不属于行政领导”。还要成立肃反工作，体制人事，生活福利等三个小组，要“组织力量，研究问题，提出建议，由党与行政执行”。而且他规定肃反工作小组的任务是：“要研究肃反、三反、镇反等运动所存在的问题，提出处理办法。应平反者平反、应认错者认错，应交代者交代，应结论者结论”。
    在这个“动员报告”中，周拾禄还提出“要民主选举，改选小组长。”他说，“在鸣、放时期，党员同志要从现在的学习小组抽开，以利揭发批评。”这样，学习小组里面的党员小组长，大多被排挤掉。周拾禄更指派亲信任承宪（九三学社成员）控制了黑板报和大字报，指挥黑板报编辑进行采访，委派新的“学委会编辑”。在他的指导下，这些宣传工具一齐开动起来辱骂共产党员“为非作歹”，要共产党员“看今日应悔当年”。有一份大字报竟公开指责该所的五个党员负责干部说：“如不站起来，我们就要把你们连同三大主义一起葬送掉”。
    周拾禄并不以篡夺了所内的整风领导权为满足，他还向九三学社南京分社的各支社负责人推广了该所成立不要党领导的“学习委员会”的经验。
    周拾禄的亲信、农具系主任蒋耀也按照周拾禄的意图积极向党进攻。他布置了斗争党员的恶毒的计划，准备今天斗争这个党员，明天斗争那个党员。这个系里有人煽动少数工人张贴大字报，反对党员林体强下工场改进水稻插秧机。还有人贴出反动的“十大要求”，提出什么“扩大民主权利，把全所大权交给所代表大会，所长由选举产生”、“改组党组”、“公开人事材料”等反动口号。“十大要求”的发起人事先曾将原稿给周拾禄看过。周拾禄还建议发起者在“十大要求”的最后，加上“同意者，请签名”的词句。他就这样发动了这一反对党和政府对学术机关的领导和委派学术机关负责人权力的煽动性的签名运动。
    周拾禄早年对稻作学的研究虽曾有过一些成就，可是近二十年来，这位科学家就再没有什么学术论文问世了。周拾禄不只是自己不钻研科学，他对于那些积极学习和钻研业务的党员，又布置他的亲信，千方百计地压制、打击。当1950年共产党员李兆森同志研究风力耕田机取得初步成效后，华东农林水利局曾派他到华东农科所继续进一步研究。周拾禄捏造一些“理论”来阻挠，并和蒋耀串通一气，始终不肯把该项工作列入系内研究计划。后来，被所长刘春安发现了，才重新列入计划。在实际工作中，蒋耀又不让工场工人为风力耕田机制造零件，以此阻挠李兆森的研究。李兆森只好亲自下工场操作，制造零件。1953年风力耕田机在南京郊区试验前，蒋耀又暗中教唆心腹人孙一清偷偷破坏他的工作。这样，李兆森同志终于被迫离开了农科所，在新的工作岗位上继续从事研究，今年才正式试验成功了（见3月4日本报消息）。
    近一月来，华东农业科学研究所已经开展了好几个回合的大辩论，绝大多数科学研究工作者和职工群众，揭发和批判了周拾禄等人的反共反社会主义的言行。周拾禄虽然承认了自己有反共、反社会主义的错误，但还不肯交代具体事实。该所反右派斗争正在深入发展。
