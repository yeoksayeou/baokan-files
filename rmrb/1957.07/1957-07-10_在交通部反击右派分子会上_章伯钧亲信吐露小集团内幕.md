At the Ministry of Communications Anti-Rightist Meeting
    A Confidant of Zhang Bojun Reveals Inside Information of the Clique

    (Our Dispatch) Yesterday afternoon, all staff members of the Ministry of Communications in Beijing continued to hold an anti-Rightist meeting. Wang Yifan, a confidant of Zhang Bojun, initially exposed some of Zhang Bojun's reactionary words and deeds.

    Wang Yifan first admitted that he had made serious mistakes in thought and action, and had long been a tool for Zhang Bojun in carrying out anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Then he began to expose some of the conspiratorial activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

    Wang Yifan said that the Zhang-Luo alliance was formed in September last year. After Zhang returned from Beidaihe, he was very happy and said to us, "Now (at that time the Egyptian problem was tense) the Third World War may break out. The democratic parties have great tasks and our responsibilities are heavy." This was a "change the sky" thought.

    Wang said that after Zhang Bojun returned from Beidaihe last year, he invited Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Zhang Yunchuan and others and me to his home for dinner, under the pretext of establishing collective leadership, saying that it was necessary to rectify the leftists in the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party in order to completely grasp the leadership. Three days later, another meeting was held at Huang Qixiang's home, mainly to discuss how to expand the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. Zhang Bojun advocated collecting old personnel and upper-level elements to use as political capital. Finally, we had dinner again at Zhang Bojun's home. During the dinner, Zhang said, "You are the five tiger generals, the Eight Immortals crossing the sea." Encouraged by him, we became active. He nominated Huang Qixiang as vice chairman, and planned to set up a Cultural and Educational Committee, a Political Research Committee, and a Medical and Health Committee, and we would run the General Office. Zhang said that it would be easier to arrange things if everyone had a temple. He also tried to win over cadres by suggesting that the status of ministers from democratic parties be raised to that of vice ministers in the government.

    Wang said that within the Ministry of Communications, the members of Zhang Bojun's clique were: Yang Yitang, Wang Jiyi, Wang Yifan, Zhuang Mingyuan, etc.

    When Wang Yifan exposed Zhang Bojun's conspiratorial activities during the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), he said that Zhang Bojun had talked with them several times, saying that the CPPCC used to be formalistic and undemocratic, with a few old men reading scripts and it was meaningless. This time, everyone should promote democracy and encourage everyone to expose shortcomings. He said that the CPPCC would have great tasks in the future, in addition to consultation and inspection, it would also have the right to agree and the right to supervise.

    Wang Yifan said that Zhang Bojun lavishly entertained guests during the CPPCC meeting and talked with Wang Zaoshi twice to discuss how to carry out activities.

    Wang Yifan said that at the national conference of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, which began at the end of March this year, Zhang Bojun fired many poisonous arrows. He said that only today was an independent and self-reliant meeting being held. He demanded a major development of the organization, and wanted to establish organizations in fifteen cities including Kunming, Guiyang, Changchun, and Harbin, to develop in the medical and health field, and to develop in industrial and mining enterprises. He also invited people to dinner individually, talked to them individually, and encouraged everyone to develop vigorously, boldly, and without worries. He also said that during this rectification campaign, all regions should act according to his instructions.

    Wang Yifan talked about Zhang Bojun sending him to the Northeast to develop the organization, saying, "Why should the organization be greatly developed during the rectification campaign?" Because Zhang Bojun believed that during the rectification period, various regions paid more attention to the democratic parties. He said that he took letters of introduction from Zhang Bojun and Huang Qixiang and successively carried out activities in Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, Jiamusi, and other places. Wang Yifan said that after he arrived in the Northeast, he promoted the role of Zhang Bojun to former soldiers and others, wanting to pull them into the party, but because Zhang Bojun's reactionary conspiracy had been exposed, it was useless. Wang Yifan finally admitted that he had obeyed Zhang Bojun in every way and had done many anti-people and anti-Communist things. He said that he would atone for his sins with action.

    Xiong Zhenzuo, Director of the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, exposed the criminal facts of the Rightist Zhang Bojun instigating the Wuhan Institute of Water Transportation Engineering (formerly the River Transportation College) to cause trouble. He said that this college, under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, began internal rectification on May 21, and invited non-Party members to participate in discussions. At this time, Rightists, headed by Ma Zhemin, a member of the Zhang-Luo alliance group and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, carried out conspiratorial activities in the Wuhan area, inciting strikes, openly spreading remarks to abolish the party committee system, demanding the removal of Cheng Yun, Director of General Affairs, and Shen Hui, the person in charge of personnel (Cheng, Shen, and Zhou were all members of the party committee), demanding that Dean Zhou Bin "get out," and demanding the transfer of the president, so that the rightists could take control of the leadership.

    Xiong Zhenzuo said that Zhang Bojun was assigned to be in charge of education in the Ministry of Communications, but he usually did not ask about education work. However, after the Rightists incited the students of the college to make trouble, he became gloating. Once, he said to me, "I will take care of this matter, I will ask about it." Our Education Bureau knew long ago that Zhang Bojun had malicious intentions about this issue. We resolutely relied on the Party and put forward our own opinions for handling it. When we told him the solution, he pretended to be active and asked us to convene a forum, but in fact he was afraid that the world would not be in chaos. At the forum, he hesitated about the proposed plan, and he used the excuse of "let the students make trouble to the end" to obstruct us from correctly handling the incident.

    At this meeting, several other confidants of Zhang also spoke, but they did not expose Zhang, nor did they conduct self-criticism, which caused great dissatisfaction among those present.

    Those who spoke at the meeting also included Zhang Chi of the Highway General Bureau, Li Zhizhong of the General Office, Wu Changyun, an engineer of the Haihe Bureau, Li Gao of the People's Communications Publishing House, Zhang Bo of the Planning and Statistics Bureau, Zuo Wenyuan, an engineer of the Shipping Bureau, and Shi Heng, Chief of the Engineering Section of the Navigation Engineering Bureau.

    在交通部反击右派分子会上
    章伯钧亲信吐露小集团内幕
    本报讯　昨天下午交通部在京机关全体工作人员继续举行反击右派分子大会。章伯钧的亲信王一帆初步揭发了章伯钧一些反动言行。
    王一帆首先承认自己在思想上、行动上都犯了严重的错误，长期以来做了章伯钧进行反共、反人民、反社会主义活动的工具。接着他开始揭发章罗联盟的一些阴谋活动。
    王一帆说，去年9月，章罗联盟形成，章从北戴河归来后，非常高兴，曾对我们说：“现在（当时正是埃及问题紧张）第三次世界大战可能爆发，民主党派任务大，我们的责任重。”这是变天思想。
    王说，去年章伯钧从北戴河回来后，在他家里约了黄琪翔、李伯球、张云川等人和我吃饭，以建立集体领导为名，说要整农工民主党的左派分子，以便把领导权完全掌握起来。过了三天，又在黄琪翔家里开会，主要是讨论如何把农工民主党扩大问题。章伯钧主张搜集旧人员、上层分子来做政治资本。最后又在章伯钧家里吃饭，吃饭时，章说，你们是五虎上将，八仙过海。我们受了他的鼓励就积极起来。他推选黄琪翔当副主席，并计划设置文教委员会、政治研究委员会、医药卫生委员会，我们搞办公厅。章说每个人都有一个庙就好安排。他并以建议把民主党派部长地位提到政府的副部长地位来拉拢干部。
    王说，在交通部里，章伯钧的小集团分子是：杨逸棠、王寄一、王一帆、庄明远等。
    王一帆揭露章伯钧在全国政协会议期间的阴谋活动时说，章伯钧曾约他们谈过几次话，说政协过去是形式主义，不民主，几个老头儿念念稿子，毫无意思。这次要大家发扬民主，鼓励大家揭发缺点。他说政协将来任务大，除协商、视察外，还有同意权和监察权。
    王一帆说，章伯钧在政协会议期间大肆请客，两次约王造时谈话，商量如何进行活动。
    王一帆说，在今年3月底开始举行的农工民主党的全国会议上，章伯钧放了许多毒箭。他说今天才召开一个独立作主的会议，他要求大发展组织，要在昆明、贵阳、长春、哈尔滨等十五个城市建立组织，要向医药卫生界发展，同时要向工矿企业发展。他并个别请吃饭，个别谈话，鼓励大家大力发展，大胆地干，不要有顾虑。他还说在这次整风期间，各地都要根据他的指示行动起来。
    王一帆谈到章伯钧派他到东北发展组织时说，为什么要在整风期间大发展组织呢，因为章伯钧认为在整风时间，各地比较重视民主党派。他说，他拿了章伯钧、黄琪翔的介绍信先后在沈阳、大连、长春、哈尔滨、佳木斯等地活动。王一帆说，他到东北后，向旧军人等宣传章的作用如何如何，想拉他们入党，但是由于章伯钧的反动阴谋已被揭发，所以没有用。王一帆最后承认他对章伯钧百依百顺，做了许多反人民反共的事。他表示要以行动来赎罪。
    交通部教育局局长熊振作揭发章伯钧右派分子煽动武汉水运工程学院（即前河运学院）闹事的罪恶事实。他说，这个学院从5月21日起在中共湖北省委的领导下，开始进行党内整风，并邀请党外人士座谈。正在这个时候，以章罗联盟集团成员民盟湖北省委马哲民为首的右派分子，在武汉地区开展了阴谋活动，煽动罢课，公开散布取消党委制的言论，要求撤销总务长程云、人事负责人沈辉的职务，要教务长周彬“滚蛋”（程、沈、周三人都是党委委员），要求调走院长，以便右派分子来掌握领导权。
    熊振作说，章伯钧在交通部是分工管教育的，可是平时并没有问过教育工作。但在右派分子煽动学院学生闹事以后，他却幸灾乐祸起来。有一次，他对我说：“这件事我来管管，我来问问。”我们教育局早就知道章伯钧对这个问题是不怀好意的。我们坚决依靠党提出了自己的处理意见。等我们把解决方案告诉他时，他就假积极起来，要我们召集座谈会，其实他是唯恐天下不乱。他在座谈会上，对提出的方案支支吾吾的，他还用“让学生闹到底”为借口来阻挠我们来正确处理这次事件。
    在这次会上，章的其他几个亲信也讲了话，但没有对章进行揭发，也没有进行自我检查，引起到会者很大不满。
    在会上发言的，还有公路总局的张墀、办公厅的李致中、海河局工程师吴昌运、人民交通出版社李高、计划统计局张勃、航运局工程师左文渊、航务工程局工程科长石衡等人。
