   “Psychological Shock's” “New Proposal”
    Former French Minister of the Interior, Socialist Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, published a proposal in the Parisian newspaper "Le Monde" this week for resolving the Algerian problem. It is said that this proposal was submitted to the Mollet government last September. Presumably, due to the French government's preoccupation with the war and the ensuing political turmoil, the proposal was shelved for a period. Now, French colonialists apparently believe it is time to put forward this proposal to test public opinion.
    Bourgès-Maunoury's main idea is to "establish two countries in Algeria by administrative order," one for Muslim residents and one for residents of European descent. These two nominally "sovereign states" would be linked with other French-African territories by a "Mediterranean alliance" and a development plan.
    Even the proposer himself admits that this plan is very "strange" from a legal point of view. Therefore, he once asked a French "senior legal authority" for help. In fact, for bourgeois law, it is not difficult to make any interpretation that conforms to the wishes of the bourgeoisie. What is worth pondering is why the French bourgeoisie wants such a plan and why it is now revealing it. On this point, Bourgès-Maunoury at least didn't want everyone to rack their brains too much. He said that there is an urgent need to put forward such a "psychological shock" proposal in order to strengthen France's position at the UN General Assembly meeting in September. He also explained that he was worried that France might no longer be able to rely on full US support on this issue.
    Thus, things become clear. The reason why this plan is said to be "strange" is because the planners of this partition plan do not believe that it will truly be a solution to the Algerian problem. The main motivation for putting forward this plan is propaganda.
    The session of the UN General Assembly in the autumn is not far away now. The approach of this date makes the French colonialist clique restless. Once the General Assembly opens, the troublesome Algerian question will be raised again, and this time the situation will be even more unfavorable to France.
    In order to prevent the United Nations from interfering with its colonial tyranny in Algeria, the French government has used various methods. Rogue tactics have also been used, such as withdrawing from the meeting, but the result of adopting such tactics was extremely disgraceful. Using the method of kowtowing to seek US help once again, as in the situation when this issue was discussed at the last session, is still something to be hoped for. The United States currently also has many areas where it needs France's help, so Dulles recently did not hesitate to show his face and help the French colonialists in their colonial suppression in Algeria, disapproving of the intervention proposals put forward by some US senators; although in the Secretary of State's heart, he may not be averse to the US intervening if there is an opportunity. However, in order to perfunctorily appease public opinion, some more trump cards have to be added. To continue to cling to Washington's thighs, some strategy must be paid attention to. According to Bourgès-Maunoury himself, his proposal was put forward out of these two considerations.
    The proposer of Bourgès-Maunoury's proposal hopes to use this method to cause "psychological shock" and strengthen France's position at the UN General Assembly in September. How much subjectivism this contains is not something to be discussed for the time being. But what is most noteworthy is that this proposal objectively acknowledges the bankruptcy of the French government's current Algerian policy, while still crudely ignoring the Algerian people's right to self-determination.

### “心理震动”的“新建议”

   “心理震动”的“新建议”
    前法国内政部长、社会党人莫克本星期在巴黎“世界报”上发表了一个解决阿尔及利亚问题的建议，据说这个建议是在去年9月就提给了当时的摩勒政府的，大概是因为法国政府忙于作战和随之而来的政局动荡之故，这个建议被搁置了一段时期。现在，法国殖民者显然认为是拿出这个建议来试探舆论的时候了。
    莫克建议的主意，就是在阿尔及利亚“用行政命令建立两个国家”，一个穆斯林居民的，一个欧洲血统居民的。这两个名义上的“主权国家”，将用一个“地中海同盟”和一个开发计划同其他法属非洲圈在一起。
    连这个建议的提出人本身也承认，这个计划从法律观点看来是非常“奇怪的”。因此他曾经请了一位法国的“高级法学权威”帮忙。其实，对于资产阶级的法律来说，要作出任何合乎资产阶级愿望的解释，是并不困难的。值得捉摸的倒是为什么法国资产阶级要这么一个计划，并且现在把它透露出来。在这一点上，莫克总算没有要大家为之多绞脑汁。他说，迫切需要提出这样一个“心理震动”的建议，以便加强法国在联合国大会9月会议上的地位。他还解释说，他担心法国在这个问题上可能不能再依靠美国的充分支持。
    这样，事情就明白了。所以要把这个计划说成是“奇怪的”，是因为这个分治计划的策划者就不相信它会真正是解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法。提出这个计划的主要动机是在于宣传。
    联合国大会秋季会议的会期离现在已经不远了。这个日期的逼近使法国殖民主义集团坐立不安。大会一开，伤脑筋的阿尔及利亚问题又要提出来，而这一次的形势对法国是更加不利的。
    为了不让联合国来干预它在阿尔及利亚的殖民暴政，法国政府使用了各种方法。流氓手段也耍过，就是退出会议，但是采取这种手段的结果极不光彩。用叩头的办法来求得美国再一次的帮忙，就像上届会议讨论这个问题的情形一样，也还是可以抱希望的。美国目前也有不少需要借助法国一臂之力的地方，所以杜勒斯最近不惜抛头露面，为法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚的殖民镇压在帮腔，不赞同一部分美国参议员提出的进行干预的主张；虽然在国务卿的心里，未始不想一有机会美国就插足进去。但是，为了搪塞舆论，多少得增加一些底牌。要继续抱华盛顿的大腿，也得讲究一点策略才行。按莫克自己所说，他的建议正是出于这两方面的考虑提出来的。
    莫克建议的提议人希望用这个办法引起“心理震动”，并且加强法国在9月联合国大会上的地位，这中间包含多少主观主义，暂且不去说它。但是这个建议客观上承认了法国政府现行阿尔及利亚政策的破产，同时仍粗暴地无视阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利，这倒是最可以注意的。（胡）
