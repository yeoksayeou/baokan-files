    "Today's Weather..."
    Xu Hui
    I don't know when it started, but some newspaper editorial departments have become highly interested in "Today's Weather..." For a while, some newspapers almost became "weather reports," but they shed the formula of "weather forecasts" and replaced it with elegant phrases like "thawing," "spring chill," "the fickle warmth of early spring," "unsettled weather of early spring, alternating between warmth and rain," "late spring," "spring wind does not reach...", and so on. A sense of coldness prevailed, with the highest temperature always around zero degrees.
    What's going on? We live in the same northern hemisphere of the same Earth, in the same city of the same country. How can people have such different feelings about the climate?
    It turns out that what is being discussed here is neither official jargon like "Today's weather, ha ha ha...", nor natural phenomena, but the political climate. It shows that during major social changes, different classes, strata, and social groups have different feelings about the political climate; some people say "cold," while others say "warm."
    We often talk about 1949. It was in this year that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, completely overthrew the three mountains weighing on their heads. "We stood up," and the starving and freezing slaves rose to become masters of the country. We will never forget May 26th of that year, will we? The People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai, and freedom came to Shanghai. Whether it was the banks on the Bund or the factories in Yangshupu; whether it was the land or the rivers; whether it was the warm wind blowing from the Pacific Ocean or the white clouds drifting from the Kunlun Mountains; whether it was the morning glow of the East or the bright moonlight, everything here, everything in our motherland, belonged to the people from then on. The seeds of happiness sown by tens of thousands of pioneers bore fruit, and the red flag raised in this glorious city in 1921 triumphed. Isn't this called "thawing"? Isn't this called spring? The spring of 1949, this is our people's first spring, we feel this way, and we have the right to say so.
    However, some people disagree. Even after eight years, they are still talking about "spring chill" and looking forward to "thawing," as if spring has never come. The reason for this is not too difficult to understand. Different people have different positions. The "masters" stepped down, and the slaves came to power. How can there be a common feeling? It is naturally a fantasy to expect those former "masters" to praise the spring of the slaves.
    There are also some people who were not on the stage in the past, but lived by relying on the old foundations. By the spring of 1956, this foundation had been dug away. For the working people, it was the socialist spring, but for some people, it was winter. For others, it was "the fickle warmth of early spring": "warm" because the socialist system has given him some benefits after all, the new society seems not to be terrible, and even somewhat lovely, and it is worthwhile to serve the new society; "cold" because this is, after all, a new society, and serving it requires transforming oneself, and one has not yet adapted to this change, and always feels uncomfortable with this and that in the new society, feeling that the old society was "warmer." Between this cold and warm, leaning to the left today and leaning to the right tomorrow, unable to make up one's mind and unable to stand firm, this kind of "wavering," praised by Professor Xu Zhongnian, still occurs relatively frequently among this group of people.
    The past few months have been unforgettable for each of us. How many meetings and conversations have we participated in, what heated meetings, what cordial conversations, how close the hearts of the Party and the people are! Some people who have feelings for the new society but are not used to it have also been moved, told the Party their heartfelt words, and become closer to the Party and the working people. However, there is no need to hide that some people have also lost their way in the evil winds and noxious influences stirred up by bourgeois right-wingers. People naturally have different feelings about the political climate, and it is naturally inevitable for some people to lose their way temporarily and accidentally. Some people do not know how many explorations it will take to find the correct direction. Therefore, it is not surprising that this situation has occurred.
    The Chinese people, angered by the challenge of the right-wingers, launched a counterattack against the right-wingers under the leadership of the Party. Some of those who had lost their way have come to their senses and drawn a clear line between themselves and the right-wingers, but there are still some people who cannot see the situation clearly, who cannot see that besides the Communist Party's rectification movement, there is also an anti-Communist movement by the right-wingers, which is a class struggle. They are showing uneasiness again, they are widening their eyes and looking at the sky: "Today's weather..."
    Today's weather is very good: the dark clouds and evil winds conjured up by the right-wingers are collapsing. They cannot resist the magic weapon of Marxism. Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been published. He, like the sun, dispelled the clouds and illuminated the eyes of the people, giving the people weapons to defeat demons and monsters.
    It is not a good thing to lose one's way, but it can turn a bad thing into a good thing, as long as one walks in the right direction. Sometimes, people who have lost their way and then returned to the right path become guides for later generations. And the current anti-rightist struggle is unfolding intensely, which is precisely the time to help those who have lost their way find the correct path, and to help each of us strengthen our political direction. This is a great time that money cannot buy. The right-wing heroes are our teachers, teaching us many things that are not easy to learn in normal times, making us understand what is left, what is right, what is fragrant flower, what is poisonous weed, what is true, beautiful, and good, and what is false, ugly, and evil, and making each of us take another look at whether the position we are standing on is correct, and understand how to train ourselves into a true left-winger without parentheses.
    Summer is the season for growing crops, and it is also the season when poisonous weeds are thinking of overwhelming the crops. Is it to be with the working people, under the leadership of the Party, to fight against poisonous weeds, and to transform oneself into a left-winger in the struggle? Or is it to stand in the opposite position and help the poisonous weeds cover the crops? Or is it to take the so-called middle road of "standing by with one's hands in one's sleeves"? This is a question we should think about.
    We often say that we must master our own destiny. Just looking at the sky and lamenting that "today's weather" is changing too fast, what good can it bring to oneself? If one really thinks about coming out of the maze, then one must take the first step.

### “今天天气……”

    “今天天气……”
    徐汇
    不知道从哪一天起，有些报纸的编辑部对“今天天气……”的兴趣高涨起来了。有一阵，有的报纸几乎变成了“气象报”，不过，他们摆脱了“气象预报”的公式，换上了文雅的词句：“解冻”、“春寒”、“乍暖还寒时候”、“乍暖还寒晴复雨”、“春迟”、“春风不度……”，等等。一片阴冷，最高气温总在零度左右。
    这是怎么回事？我们生活在同一个地球的北半部，生活在同一个国家的同一个城市里，人们对气候的感觉怎么会这么不同呢？
    原来这里说的，既不是“今天天气，哈哈哈……”之类的官话，也不是自然现象，而是政治气候。它表明：在社会大变动中，各个阶级、阶层和社会集团，对于政治气候各有不同的感受，这些人说“寒”，那些人说“暖”。
    我们常常说到1949年。就是在这一年，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，彻底地推翻了压在头上的三座大山，“我们站起来了”，饥寒交迫的奴隶上升为国家的主人。我们总不会忘记那一年的5月26日吧？人民解放军进了上海，自由也就来到了上海。不论是外滩的银行，还是杨树浦的工厂；不论是土地，还是河流；不论是太平洋上吹来的暖风，还是昆仑山上飘来的白云；不论是东方的朝霞，还是皎洁的月光，这里的一切，我们祖国的一切，从此都归人民所有了。成千成万的先行者播下的幸福的种子结果了，1921年在这个光荣城市举起的红旗胜利了。这还不叫“解冻”？这还不叫春天？1949年的春天，这是我们人民的第一个春天，我们这样感受，也有权这样说。
    可是，偏偏有人不同意。甚至在过了八年之后，还在那里说“春寒”、望“解冻”，好像春天根本没有来过。这中间的道理，想来也不太难懂，各个人的地位不同，“主人”下台，奴隶上台，怎么能够有共同的感受呢？要那些昔日的“主人”歌颂奴隶们的春天，那自然是幻想。
    还有一些人，他们过去也没有在台上，而是依附在旧的根基上生活的。到了1956年春天，这个根基被挖掉了。这对劳动人民来说，是社会主义的春天，对有些人来说，是冬天。对另一些人来说，却是“乍暖还寒”：“暖”的是社会主义制度毕竟给了他一些好处，新社会看来并不可怕，甚至还有一些可爱，为新社会服务是值得的；“寒”的是这毕竟是个新社会，要为它服务就需要改造自己，自己还没有适应这种变化，总觉得新社会这也不习惯，那也不习惯，不如旧社会“温暖”。在这一寒一暖之间，今天向左边靠靠，明天又向右边靠靠，拿不定个主意，站不稳个立场，也就是徐仲年教授所赞扬的那么一种“动摇性”，在这一部分人中间，还是比较经常出现的。
    刚刚过去的几个月，对于我们每一个人都是难忘的。我们参加了多少次会议和交谈呵，多么热烈的会议，多么亲切的交谈呵，党和人民的心靠得多么近呵！有一些对新社会有感情又不习惯的人，也受了感动，向党说了知心话，同党、同劳动人民更接近了。但是，也用不到隐瞒，在资产阶级右派分子煽动起来的歪风邪气里，也有人迷失了方向。对政治气候的感受本来就有不同，暂时的、偶然的迷失了方向，对有些人来说，这本来也是难免的，有的人不知道要经过多少次的探索才找到正确的方向。所以，出现这种情况，也不必奇怪。
    由右派分子的挑战所激怒的中国人民，在党的领导下，发起了对右派的反击，那些曾经迷失了方向的人，有的人明白过来了，同右派分子划清了界限，但也还有一些人看不清局势，看不清现在除了共产党的整风运动，还有一个右派分子的反共运动，这是一种阶级斗争。他们又表示不安了，他们鼓起眼睛，望着天空：“今天天气……”
    今天天气很好：右派分子祭起的乌云和妖风正在溃散。他们抵不住马克思主义这一降妖的法宝。毛泽东同志“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告发表了，他像太阳一样，驱散了云雾，照亮了人民的眼睛，使人民有了武器，去战胜牛鬼蛇神。
    一个人迷失方向，虽然不是好事，却可以变坏事为好事。只要他走到正确的方向来。有的时候，曾经迷失过方向又走到正路上来的人，反而成为后来的人们的引路人。而目前反右派的斗争正在紧张地展开着，这正是帮助那些迷失过方向的人寻找正确道路的时候，帮助我们每一个人坚定自己的政治方向的时候。这真是千金难买的大好时光，右派的英雄好汉们作我们的先生，教给我们许许多多在平时不易学到的东西，使我们懂得什么叫左派，什么叫右派，什么是香花，什么是毒草，什么是真的、美的、善的，什么是假的、丑的、恶的，使我们每一个人再一次看一看我们自己站的立场是否正确，懂得怎样才能把自己锻炼成一个真正的、不带括号的左派。
    夏天是长庄稼的季节，也是毒草想着压倒庄稼的季节。是同劳动人民在一起，在党的领导下，向毒草作斗争，并且在斗争中改造自己成为一个左派呢？还是站在相反的地位，帮助毒草盖过庄稼？还是走“袖手旁观”的所谓中间路线呢？这是我们应当想一想的问题。
    我们常常说，要掌握自己的命运。只是望着天空，感叹“今天天气”变化太快，能给自己带来什么好处呢？如果真的想着从迷途中走出来，那就要迈开第一步。　　（原载“解放日报”）
