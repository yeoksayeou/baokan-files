My full support goes to Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report." This report not only summarizes our country's great achievements and rich experiences of the past year but also refutes the various fallacies and lies of the right-wing elements convincingly. I would like to add a few points regarding the railway work of the past year.

1956 was the year when China achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. The rapid development of the national economy and the further improvement of the people's living standards have placed higher demands on railway transportation and railway construction. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, all railway workers have brought into play their enthusiasm for building socialism. Through the vigorous development of the advanced producer movement across the entire railway system, they have overcome various difficulties and fulfilled and overfulfilled the 1956 plan.

In terms of capital construction, the amount completed in 1956, whether for new line construction or operational line renovation projects, exceeded that of previous years. A total of 1,747 kilometers of new railway tracks were laid throughout the year. Many new railway projects, such as the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, and the Fengtai-Shacheng Railway, were extremely arduous. For example, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is 668 kilometers long, with the Qinling Mountains to the north and the Jianmen Mountains to the south. It crosses the Wei River, Jialing River, Baishui River, and Fu River a total of 19 times, with 160 large and medium-sized bridges and 300 tunnels totaling 83 kilometers in length. Most of the line passes through mountainous areas with rugged terrain and complex geology. The difficulty of the project is unprecedented in the history of railway construction in China. In addition to new trunk railways, 285 kilometers of railway trunk lines were restored in 1956, and 210 kilometers of new and restored double tracks were built. Dedicated lines built by the railway department totaled 866 kilometers. In 1956, a total of 3,108 kilometers of track were laid. From 1953 to 1956, a cumulative total of 4,387 kilometers of new railway trunk lines were built, exceeding the Five-Year Plan target one year ahead of schedule. 324 kilometers of railway trunk lines were restored, 356 kilometers of new double tracks were built, 420 kilometers of double tracks were restored, and 2,045 kilometers of new enterprise-dedicated lines were built, totaling 7,532 kilometers.

In terms of passenger and freight transportation, the annual passenger turnover volume was 34.4 billion passenger-kilometers, exceeding the annual plan by 23.8 percent and exceeding the 1957 target of the Five-Year Plan by 7.5 percent. The annual freight turnover volume was 120.3 billion ton-kilometers, exceeding the annual plan by 11.6 percent, which is close to the 1957 target of the Five-Year Plan. The development of the anti-Rightist conservatism movement has inspired the enthusiasm of railway workers in building socialism. At the initiative of advanced producers, a competition movement for locomotives producing one million ton-kilometers per day was launched across the railway system, thereby gradually increasing the train traction weight. In January 1956, the train traction weight of the six major trunk lines, namely Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Shenyang-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Harbin-Dalian, and Shanghai-Nanjing, was increased from 2,250 tons to 2,400 tons, and then further increased to 2,700 tons in May. Based on the two increases in train traction weight, the number of excess axle tons increased by one-quarter compared to 1955. The increase in train traction weight has played a significant role in alleviating the transportation tension in certain line sections. In 1956, the labor productivity of transportation personnel increased by 11.3 percent compared to the plan, exceeding the 1957 target of the Five-Year Plan by 13.2 percent. The transportation cost decreased by 8.4 percent compared to the plan, reaching the 1957 target of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.

The above facts show that in 1956, the railway workers, like the workers in many other economic sectors, made great contributions to the country in both railway capital construction and passenger and freight transportation. The achievements and experiences gained are also significant. However, it should be pointed out that in the construction of new lines, there is a tendency to eagerly pursue track connection and opening to traffic, neglecting project quality and transportation-related projects. Although the transportation plan was overfulfilled, the transportation capacity in some sections of certain trunk lines was limited due to the lagging of technical renovations, failing to fully meet the needs of passenger and freight transportation. This is related to our leadership's eagerness for quick success and lack of foresight.

The 1957 railway plan was formulated in accordance with the central government and the State Council's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, the instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, and combined with the current specific conditions of the railway. In 1957, the state's investment in railways decreased by 32 percent compared to 1956, a reduction of 600 million yuan. To reverse the phenomenon of overemphasizing new line construction and neglecting the strengthening of old lines in recent years, 57 percent of the investment in 1957 will be used for technical renovation of operational railways and the purchase of locomotives and rolling stock, and 30 percent of the investment will be used for building new railways, with the expectation of eliminating the contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation needs on several major trunk lines within a few years.

In the arrangement of new line construction in 1957, the first is the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. This railway is mainly used to undertake transportation between North China and Northwest China, support the construction of the Northwest, and is the second trunk line to divert freight flow from the Longhai and Beijing-Hankou Railways. Without this second line, the Longhai Railway would still have difficulty in taking into account the transportation of the Northwest and Southwest after initial renovations. Construction will begin simultaneously from the north and south ends this year and is expected to be completed by the end of 1958 or 1959.

Baoji-Chengdu Railway and Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. Although these two new railways, which were opened to traffic last year, have already started temporary operations and have begun to undertake the transportation of Sichuan grain and Fujian timber, there are still many unfinished projects and landslide sections that threaten traffic that need to be continued to be built and rectified, requiring them to meet the standards for official operation by the end of the year.

Last year, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was laid to Xiadong, 1,024 kilometers west of Lanzhou, exceeding the original planned progress of the Five-Year Plan, but it also left many unfinished projects that need to be continued this year, striving to achieve the standard that can be officially operated.

New lines in the Southwest, such as Neijiang-Kunming, Ganshui-Guiyang, and Duyun-Guiyang, are the key construction projects this year. The Neijiang-Kunming Railway and the Ganshui-Guiyang Railway will mainly concentrate on building the Min River Bridge and the Liangfeng'ao Tunnel, starting construction of these projects with long construction periods and controlling the completion date of the entire line in advance, and preparing for the start of construction of the entire line. In addition, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which connects the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, will also be completed within this year, two years ahead of schedule. Under the conditions of this year's financial and material resources, we believe that this arrangement is basically appropriate. The construction of the Nanping-Guan'tou Railway was considered from a military, political, and economic perspective in 1956. In 1957, construction will continue, and it is planned to lay tracks to Eyang (18 kilometers from Shuikou) to organize water and land combined transportation with the Min River (navigation of ships from Nanping to Shuikou is difficult during the dry season). Regarding the Zhangping-Longyan line, on the one hand, the survey and design have not yet been completed, and on the other hand, it needs to be combined with the construction scale and progress of the coal mine on the line, so it cannot be built at present. As for the failure of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to continue westward, it was not included in the plan due to insufficient transportation capacity in the Luoyang-Shanxian section of the Longhai Railway and limited financial and material resources. In addition, in terms of railway restoration, it was also decided this year to first restore the Bisezhai-Hekou section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to restore an international passage for Yunnan Province. In order to build the Guiyang-Guangxi Railway to the trunk line standard, we first restored the Jinchengjiang-Duyun section to the old standard last year, temporarily serving as a convenient road to facilitate reconstruction starting next year. The Duyun-Guiyang section will be the focus of construction this year according to the trunk line standard.

The key projects for the technical renovation of operational railways in 1957 are to continue renovating the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway; build double tracks on the Beijing-Hankou Railway north of Zhengzhou, the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway east of Yangquan, the Longhai Railway west of Zhengzhou and east of Shanxian, and the Beijing-Baotou Railway east of Zhangjiakou. These sections are all areas where the passing capacity has reached saturation and the transportation volume is increasing rapidly in the near future, and double tracks need to be built urgently. Continue to build railway hubs in Beijing, Shenyang, and other places and install automatic block devices between Nancang and Shenyang. In addition, invest in new locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. It is estimated that the transportation plan will be overfulfilled during the Five-Year Plan period, but the purchase of locomotives will be 48 units less than planned, and the purchase of freight cars will be 2,573 units less than planned. Although the purchase of passenger cars exceeds the planned quantity, passenger cars are still insufficient compared with the rapid growth of passenger volume. This is mainly due to limited manufacturing capacity and failure to complete more, which relatively weakens the reserve strength of transportation. The technical renovation project of operational railways has a large task this year and was deployed late. All railway workers are working hard to strive to complete the annual construction task as much as possible.

The 1957 transportation plan was arranged on the principle of strengthening further cooperation among various departments of the national economy, improving material allocation work, reducing unreasonable transportation, improving the balance of transportation, and taking into account the overall planning and rational arrangement of various modes of transportation. The annual railway freight turnover volume is 126.5 billion ton-kilometers, an increase of 5.1 percent compared to 1956. In terms of passenger transportation, the widespread use of vehicle application and group turnover methods, fully utilizing the efficiency of passenger cars, and improving the travel speed of passenger trains, the annual passenger turnover volume is set at 35.6 billion passenger-kilometers, an increase of 3 percent compared to 1956. Judging from the implementation in the first half of the year, the transportation volume is likely to be overfulfilled due to the realization of the production increase plan. In order to avoid the possible transportation tension in the fourth quarter, organizing the advance transportation of coal and other materials in the third quarter will be decisive. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue.

The rapid growth of transportation volume and the failure of the growth of transportation capacity to adapt to the growth of transportation volume is the main contradiction in the current railway transportation work. Starting this year, we will spend several years using considerable strength to strengthen operational railways and vigorously carry out technical renovations in order to gradually change this situation. At present, the direction of railway technical renovation, from the perspective of power, is one is dieselization and the other is electrification. Dieselization is more economical than electrification in terms of investment, but considering that China's petroleum industry is not yet developed, more consideration should be given to electrification. The advantage of railway electrification is that not only can the passing capacity be increased by one to two and a half times, and the vehicle turnaround time can be shortened by 10 to 12 percent, but also because the thermal efficiency of electric locomotives is high, it can save 50 to 60 percent of coal compared to using steam locomotives. In 1956, railway locomotives used 7.4 million tons of coal. Saving half of it would be 3.7 million tons. If hydropower can be used, even more can be saved, which can reduce transportation costs by 20 to 30 percent. On lines with heavy traffic, the increased investment due to electrification can be earned back within one and a half to three years. On many trunk lines, the construction of double tracks or parallel lines can be postponed, thereby saving a lot of steel and wood. When building new lines in mountainous areas, if electric locomotives are used, the slope and curvature of the line can be larger, thereby reducing the cost. In addition, electric locomotives do not require water, the number of crew members can be reduced by 50 percent, and maintenance costs are also lower. There are many advantages, such as winter protection, fire prevention in forest areas, working conditions, and avoiding noise and soot in urban areas. Its outstanding disadvantage is that it uses more copper. However, according to current needs, the slope near the Qinling Mountains on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is 30 per mille, and electrification is necessary to adapt to the transportation of materials in the Southwest. If the line is restored, the investment will be even greater, and the problem of coal smoke in long tunnels cannot be solved. Other lines such as the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway and the North Tongpu Railway must also be gradually considered for electrification based on terrain difficulties and traffic development. We are preparing to carry out design, but we also need relevant departments to assist and cooperate to strive for gradual implementation in the second five-year plan.

In the past year, due to our leadership's shortcomings and mistakes, there are still some phenomena between the railway and the people that need to be improved urgently. First, some train staff have a stiff attitude towards passenger service and are impatient in answering questions. The cleanliness and sanitation of some stations and carriages are also poor. In July and August last year, the number of passengers increased sharply. In addition to putting all available passenger cars into transportation, more than 500 wagon cars were also mobilized to transport passengers, which caused great inconvenience to passengers. Even so, some stations still had passengers who could not buy tickets or get on the train for two or three days. In the future, in addition to increasing passenger cars as much as possible, it is also necessary to improve vehicle turnover and accelerate the utilization efficiency of passenger cars, and vigorously strengthen ticket sales organization. Some items in passenger service are complicated, and the fee standards are not reasonable enough. We are preparing to study and adjust them. Regarding the issue of passenger meals, due to the limited equipment conditions of dining cars, it is impossible to supply a large amount in a timely manner. In the future, in addition to improving the quality of food in dining cars, we will try to strengthen the food supply at stations to make up for the insufficient supply of dining cars.

Second, the relationship between railway greening along the line and farmers also needs to have clear regulations. The current situation is that, on the one hand, the railway has planted seedlings outside the railway line boundary, and on the other hand, some farmers have used the land temporarily not used within the road boundary to cultivate crops, and the railway has also planted seedlings on these cultivated land. We hope that for protective forests planted to prevent sand damage, snow damage, and flood erosion, it is best to plant them according to actual needs, and we hope that the people along the line will provide assistance and protect them, and do not easily remove or cut them down, in order to ensure the continuous stability of the roadbed and ensure smooth traffic. As for the seedlings planted outside the existing road boundary, we have notified the railway bureaus to reasonably deal with the local people's committees nearby to protect the seedlings or transplant them; the seedlings on the cultivated land within the existing road boundary are also negotiated by the railway bureau and the local people's committees to determine whether to protect or transplant the seedlings based on the specific situation, taking into account agricultural production and maintaining the dryness and stability of the roadbed. On lines where there is no road boundary to be found, it can also be handled according to the above method.

Third, the railway freight transportation fine system is a means to ensure the realization of planned management, promote socialist construction, and mutually restrict railways and shippers. Fines are not used as railway transportation revenue, so it is wrong to establish a fine system as "maintaining railway interests." In recent years, according to feedback from various parties, we have canceled some fine regulations that place excessive demands on shippers, and some excessive fine amounts have also been appropriately reduced, but some reasonable fines should still be adhered to. For the railway, there are fines for overdue delivery and fines for violating the freight car transfer time, which are all constraints on the railway to deliver goods on time and send cars to shippers on time. In the past, the railway had to pay fines only if the shipper made a request to the railway bureau. From November 10, 1956, we have changed it to the station taking the initiative to pay the consignee, which shows that the People's Railway is responsible to the shipper. For shippers, in order to correct the unreasonable use of national transportation capacity or waste of national transportation capacity, they should also bear part of the material responsibility. The purpose is to remind shippers to make more rational use of the country's railway transportation capacity through this method. At present, the miscellaneous fees for railway freight transportation are also too trivial, and we are preparing to further simplify them.

In addition, we still have many shortcomings. We hope that under the supervision and help of all the people, we will strive to overcome our shortcomings and mistakes, further improve the People's Railway, and serve the socialist construction cause of our country.

    进一步办好人民铁道为我国社会主义建设事业服务
    滕代远的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，这个报告不仅总结了我国一年来的伟大成就和丰富的经验，而且令人信服地驳斥了右派分子的种种谬论和谎言，我仅就一年来的铁道工作作一点补充。
    一九五六年是我国社会主义革命取得决定性胜利的一年。国民经济的迅速发展，人民生活的进一步改善，都对铁路运输和铁路建设事业提出更高的要求。全路职工在党和政府的正确领导下，发挥了建设社会主义的积极性，通过全路先进生产者运动的蓬勃开展，克服了种种困难，完成和超额完成了一九五六年计划。
    在基本建设方面，不论新线建设和营业线改造工程，一九五六年完成的数量均超过以往各个年度。全年完成新建铁路铺轨一千七百四十七公里，很多新建铁路如宝成线、鹰厦线、丰沙线等工程非常艰巨，如宝成线全长六百六十八公里，北有秦岭，南有剑门山区，中间跨渭河、嘉陵江、白水河及涪江共十九次，大中桥共一百六十座，隧道三百座总长八十三公里，大部分线路通过地形险峻和地质复杂的山岳地区，工程艰巨的程度在中国铁路修建史上是空前的。一九五六年除新建铁路干线外，还恢复铁路干线二百八十五公里，新建和恢复复线二百一十公里，由铁道部门代建的专用线共八百六十六公里。一九五六年共计铺轨三千一百零八公里。一九五三年至一九五六年累计，新建铁路干线四千三百八十七公里，提前一年超额完成了五年计划。恢复铁路干线三百二十四公里，新建复线三百五十六公里，恢复复线四百二十公里，新建企业专用线二千零四十五公里，共计七千五百三十二公里。
    在客货运输方面，全年旅客周转量完成三百四十四亿人公里，比年度计划超过百分之二十三点八，超过五年计划一九五七年指标的百分之七点五。全年货物周转量完成一千二百零三亿吨公里，比年度计划超过百分之十一点六，已接近五年计划一九五七年指标。反对右倾保守运动的开展，鼓舞了铁路职工建设社会主义的积极性，在先进生产者的倡议下，全路开展了机车日产百万吨公里竞赛运动，从而使列车牵引重量逐步提高，一九五六年一月，京汉、津浦、沈山、京山、哈大、沪宁等六大干线的列车牵引重量由二千二百五十吨提高到二千四百吨，五月份又提高到二千七百吨，在两次提高列车牵引重量的基础上，超轴吨数比一九五五年增加四分之一。列车牵引重量的提高，对缓和某些线路区段的运输紧张状态有很大作用。一九五六年运输工作人员的劳动生产率比计划提高百分之十一点三，已超过五年计划规定的一九五七年指标百分之十三点二。而运输成本比计划则降低百分之八点四，已提前一年达到五年计划一九五七年的指标。
    上述事实表明：一九五六年铁路上的职工群众，正像其他许多经济部门的职工一样，不论在铁路基本建设方面或客货运输方面，都为国家作了很大的贡献，所取得的成绩和经验也是巨大的。但是应该指出，在新线建设方面，有着急于追求接轨通车，忽略工程质量及与运输有关工程的偏向。在运输方面虽然超额完成计划，但是在某些干线的某些区段由于技术改造没有跟上，运输能力有限制，未能完全满足客货运输的需要，这都是和我们领导上急于求成和缺乏预见有关的。
    一九五七年度的铁路计划是按照中央和国务院关于勤俭建国的方针和增产节约的指示，结合铁路当前的具体情况制定的。一九五七年国家对铁路的投资比一九五六年减少百分之三十二，计减少六亿元。为扭转几年来偏重新线建设忽视旧线加强的现象，一九五七年以投资的百分之五十七用于营业铁路的技术改造和机车车辆的购置，以百分之三十的投资用于修筑新铁路，预期在几年以内消除几条主要干线上存在的运输能力跟不上运输需要的矛盾。
    一九五七年度铁路建设在新线的安排上，首先是包头—兰州线。这条铁路主要用于担负华北与西北地区间的运输，支援西北建设，是替陇海、京汉线分散货流的第二干线，没有这条第二线，陇海线在经过初步改造之后，兼顾西北、西南的运输仍然是有困难的。今年从南北两头同时开工，预计在一九五八年底或一九五九年建成。
    宝鸡—成都线、鹰潭—厦门线。这两条在去年铺轨修通的新铁路目前虽已开办临时营业，开始担负川粮和福建木材外调的运输任务，但尚有许多未完工程以及威胁行车的坍方地段需要继续修筑和整治，要求在年底前达到可以开办正式营业的标准。
    去年兰新线铺到兰州以西一千零二十四公里的峡东，超过五年计划原定进度，但同样也留下许多未完工程，要在今年继续施工，争取作到可以正式营业的标准。
    西南的内江—昆明、赶水—贵阳、都匀—贵阳等新线今年都是重点施工。内江—昆明线和赶水—贵阳线主要集中力量修岷江大桥和凉风垩隧道，提前对这些工期长、控制全线修通日期的工程施工并作好全线开工的准备。此外，连结京汉、粤汉两线的武汉长江大桥也将提前两年定于年内建成。在今年财力物力的条件下，我们认为这样的安排基本上是恰当的。关于南平—琯头线的修建，是一九五六年从军事、政治和经济上考虑修建的，一九五七年是继续修建，计划铺轨至峨阳（距水口十八公里），以便与闽江组织水陆联运（南平至水口在枯水期轮船航行有困难）。关于漳平—龙岩一线，一方面因勘测设计尚未完成，另一方面还需与该线煤矿等建设规模和进度相结合，因此目前还不能修建。至于兰新线未能继续西进，是因陇海路洛阳—陕县段运输能力不足以及财力和物力所限未能列入计划。此外，在恢复铁路方面，今年还决定先修复滇越铁路碧色寨—河口段，为云南省恢复一条国际通路。为了按干线标准修通贵阳至广西的铁路，我们在去年先按旧标准修复了金城江至都匀段，权充便道之用，以便于明年开始改建。都（匀）贵（阳）段今年则按干线标准重点施工。
    一九五七年营业铁路技术改造的重点工程是继续改建陇海铁路宝鸡—兰州段；在京汉线郑州以北，石太线阳泉以东、陇海线郑州以西陕县以东、京包线张家口以东的地段修筑复线，这些区段都是通过能力已达饱和而且近期运量又都是递增很快的，急需修建复线。继续修筑北京、沈阳等铁路枢纽和安装南仓至沈阳间的自动闭塞装置。另外还投资新造机、客、货车。预计五年计划期间，运输计划将超额完成，而机车的购置将少于计划四十八台，货车将少于计划二千五百七十三辆，客车购置虽然超过计划数量，但与客运量的急剧增长相比，则客车仍感不足。主要是限于制造能力，未能更多完成，这样就相对地减弱了运输的后备力量。营业铁路技术改造工程今年任务较大，部署较晚，全路职工正在积极努力，尽可能争取完成全年的建设任务。
    一九五七年的运输计划是在加强国民经济各部门进一步的协作，改进物资调拨工作，减少不合理运输，提高运输的均衡程度以及各种运输方式统筹兼顾合理安排的原则下布置的，全年铁路货物周转量为一千二百六十五亿吨公里，比一九五六年增加百分之五点一。在客运方面，广泛采用车辆套用和成组周转办法，充分发挥客车的使用效率，提高旅客列车的旅行速度，全年旅客周转量定为三百五十六亿人公里，比一九五六年增加百分之三，从上半年的执行情况来看，由于增产计划的实现，运量有可能超额完成，为了避免第四季度可能出现的运输紧张情况，在第三季度组织煤炭以及其他物资提前运输将有决定作用，我们希望有关部门重视这个问题。
    运量增长快、运输能力的增长未能等速的与运量上长相适应，这是当前铁路运输工作中的主要矛盾。从今年起，我们将以几年的时间用相当的力量来加强营业铁路，大力进行技术改造，以便逐步改变这种局面。目前铁路技术改造的方向从动力方面来说，一个是内燃化，一个是电气化，内燃化的投资比电气化更经济，但以我国石油工业目前尚不发达，应该更多考虑电气化。铁路电气化的好处是不仅通过能力可以提高一至两倍半，使车辆周转时间可以缩短百分之十至十二，而且由于电力机车的热效率高，可以比使用蒸气机车节煤百分之五十至六十，一九五六年铁路机车用煤七百四十万吨，节约一半即为三百七十万吨，如能利用水电则节约更多，可以降低运输成本的百分之二十至三十，如在运量繁忙的线路上，可于一年半至三年内赚回因电化所增加的投资。在许多干线上可以推迟复线或平行线的修建，从而可以节省大量的钢铁和木材，在山岳地区修建新线时，如用电力机车，线路的坡度弯道都可较大，从而可以降低造价。此外电力机车不需要水，乘务人员可减少百分之五十，维修费也较低，冬季防寒，林区防火，劳动条件以及避免市区的喧嚣和烟灰等，好处甚多，而其突出的缺点是用铜较多。但根据目前需要，宝成铁路秦岭附近坡道千分之三十，非电化不足以适应西南物资的运输，如修复线则投资更大，而且在长大隧道中不能解决煤烟问题，其他如京绥线、北同蒲线根据地形困难和运量发展亦须逐步考虑电化，我们正准备进行设计，但还需有关部门协助配合，争取在第二个五年逐步实施。
    一年以来，由于我们领导上的缺点和错误，因而使得铁路和人民之间还存在着一些亟待改善的现象。第一、有些列车工作人员对旅客服务态度生硬，解答问题不耐心。有些车站和车内的清洁卫生工作也较差。去年七、八月份旅客大量增加，除了将能够利用的客车全部投入运输以外，还抽调了五百多辆棚车输送旅客，使旅客感到很大不便，即使如此，有些车站也还有旅客两三天买不到票，上不去车的情况。今后除尽量增加客车外，还要提高车辆周转，加速客车的运用效率，大力加强售票组织工作。在旅客服务方面有些项目繁杂，取费标准也有不够合理之处，我们准备加以研究调整。关于旅客饭食问题，由于餐车设备条件限制，不可能及时大量供应，今后除提高餐车饭菜质量外，尽量加强车站的食品供应，以弥补餐车的供应不足。
    第二、由于铁路沿线绿化与农民的关系也需要有明确规定，目前的情况是：一方面铁路在沿线路界以外种植了树苗，另一方面也有农民利用路界以内暂未使用的土地耕种农作物而铁路又在这些耕地上种植树苗，我们希望凡是为了防止砂害、雪害和洪水冲刷而栽植的防护林，最好仍按实际需要种植，并希沿线人民有力协助并加以爱护，不要轻易拔除或砍伐，以便确保路基的经常稳定使交通畅通无阻。至于现有路界以外种植的树苗，我们已通知各路局就近与地方人民委员会合理处理保苗或移植；在现有路界以内已耕田地上的树苗，也由路局与地方人民委员会协商在兼顾农业生产和保持路基干燥稳定的条件下，根据具体情况确定保苗或移植。现无路界可查的线路上，也可按以上办法处理。
    第三、铁路货物运输的罚款制度是保证实现计划管理、促进社会主义建设、对铁路和货主相互制约的一种手段，罚款并不做为铁路的运输收入，因此把建立罚款制度作为“维护铁路利益”的作法乃是错误的，近年来我们根据各方面的反映取消了一些对货主过高要求的罚款规定，有些罚款额过多的也适当降低，但是有些合理的罚款还是应该坚持的，对铁路方面来说，有运到逾期罚款，违反货车调到时间罚款等都是制约铁路按时运到货物与按时送车给货主的，过去铁路被罚都是要货主向铁路管理局提出要求铁路才支付罚款，从一九五六年十一月十日起我们已经改为由车站主动支给收货人，这都是表示人民铁道对货主负责的作法。对货主来说，为了纠正不合理地使用国家运输力或浪费国家运输力也应该担负一部分物质责任，其目的就是通过这种办法提醒货主更合理地利用国家的铁道运输力。目前铁路货运的杂费也有失琐碎，我们也准备进一步加以简化。
    此外，我们还有许多缺点，我们希望能够在全体人民的监督和帮助之下，努力克服自己的缺点和错误，进一步办好人民铁道，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务。
