Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 9th: Indonesian Constitutional Assembly Speaker Wilopo and his party left Guangzhou for Hong Kong this morning.

On the eve of his departure from Guangzhou, Mr. Wilopo told reporters about his impressions of his visit to China. He said that his overall impression of this visit to China is that the lives of the Chinese working people have improved, which is the same for factory workers and staff of government departments; even though I do not know much about the lives of farmers, I have seen that the lives of farmers have also improved. He also said that the living standards of the Chinese and Indonesian people are still low. However, the Chinese people have a sense of security, they have no fear, and are not afraid of being robbed or stolen from. Now, the Chinese people are using all feasible methods to carry out construction, such as the textile industry and machine manufacturing that have been seen.

The Speaker of the Indonesian Constitutional Assembly also said that they have obtained sufficient materials on the history of China's formulation of the constitution and have listened to the explanations of the Chinese government.

During his stay in China, Mr. Wilopo visited Beijing, Shenyang, Anshan, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai and other cities, and only arrived in Guangzhou at noon on the 8th.

    韦洛坡离广州去港
    据新华社广州9日电　印度尼西亚制宪议会议长韦洛坡一行今晨离开广州前往香港。
    韦洛坡先生在离开广州前夕对记者发表访华观感说，他这次来到中国的总的印象是中国劳动人民的生活已经有了改进，这在工厂工人和机关的职工都一样；即使了解农民生活不多，我看到农民生活也有所改进。他并说，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的生活水平还是低的。但是，中国人民有一种安全的感觉，他们没有恐惧，不怕被抢和被偷。现在，中国人民正利用一切可行的方法进行建设，如所见到的纺织工业和机器制造业。
    这位印度尼西亚制宪议会议长还说，关于中国制订宪法的历史，他们已获得充足的材料，并且听取了中国政府的解释。
    韦洛坡先生在中国期间曾访问了北京、沈阳、鞍山、天津、南京、上海等城市，8日中午才到广州。
