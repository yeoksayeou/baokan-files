Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 9th: A symposium of people from industrial and commercial circles, jointly convened by the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Local Industry Department, and the Finance and Trade Department, concluded on the 8th. At the meeting, it was announced that most of the opinions raised by people from industrial and commercial circles regarding the work of the Party and the government had been addressed.

This symposium began on May 29th and held nine meetings in succession until June 6th, during which forty-four people spoke. After they raised ninety opinions on issues such as public-private co-management relations and personnel arrangements in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the symposium adjourned for a month. During this recess, relevant Party and government departments conducted investigations into all the opinions one by one, and as of now, fifty-one opinions have been earnestly resolved in a timely manner.

At the symposium, Li Jinchang, Deputy Manager of the Tianjin Rubber Industry Company, pointed out that the division of labor between the public manager and the private deputy manager in the Rubber Industry Company was not clear enough. The First Bureau of Light Industry and the company conducted an inspection and jointly studied the issue with the public manager and the private deputy manager, redefining the division of labor: the public manager is responsible for production planning, personnel, and technical inspection; the private deputy manager is responsible for finance, supply and marketing, and safety technology. This decision was not only announced to all cadres in the company but also conveyed at the Party branch meeting on June 20th, and daily work is now being carried out according to the division of responsibilities. Xu Zisu, a standing committee member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out that the work permits of private personnel in the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Industry Company did not include their positions, which showed a lack of respect for private personnel. Now, the company has filled in the positions of all private personnel on their work permits. Regarding the arrangement of private personnel, Che Chongyuan, Deputy Manager of the Tianjin Paint and Pigment Industry Company, pointed out that the Second Bureau of Light Industry's arrangement of Zhao Yunting, the former manager of the Qinhua Ink Factory, as a clerk in the Cultural and Educational Supplies Industry Company, was flawed. After understanding and investigating by the Second Bureau of Light Industry, it was determined that Zhao Yunting had experience in supply and marketing, and it has been decided to promote Zhao Yunting to Deputy Section Chief of the Supply and Marketing Section of the company. Liu Huapu, manager of the Public-Private Joint Second Traditional Chinese Medicine General Store, raised concerns about the privileged thinking of individual public representatives, such as the housing problem being very difficult in the Second Traditional Chinese Medicine General Store, where others could not find housing, but the public deputy manager occupied a storefront. Now, the Municipal Pharmaceutical Materials Company has ordered the public deputy manager to move to the company dormitory.

At the symposium, many people also put forward useful suggestions on business technology and increasing production and practicing economy. For example, Wang Guangying suggested that the Modern Chemical Plant should use six-pound cotton cloth instead of twelve-pound cotton cloth for making oilcloth, which could save a lot of money. This suggestion has been approved by the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission and included in the production plan for the third and fourth quarters of this year.

Another seventeen opinions, after investigation and research by relevant departments, were found to have some discrepancies with the facts and have also been explained.

During the recess of the symposium, four groups consisting of people from industrial and commercial circles who attended the meeting and relevant government departments were formed to analyze and study the issues raised at the symposium regarding public-private co-management relations, mutual aid funds for living welfare, the removal of "labels" from private personnel, and the contradictions between social activities and enterprise work, and put forward some suggestions. Because these issues involve a wide range and cannot be resolved immediately or are beyond the ability of the local authorities to resolve, these issues have also been forwarded to the relevant municipal or central departments for research and handling.

When the symposium was announced to be concluded yesterday, Wang Xiaoyi, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech. He said that most of the opinions raised by everyone at this symposium were very good, and the relevant departments have earnestly handled them. Those that could be resolved have been resolved, and those that cannot be resolved immediately are being further studied. It has only been a little over a year since the implementation of industry-wide joint operation, and some problems have arisen on the basis of embodying the superiority of joint ventures. Certain bourgeois rightists believe that enterprises are better off under private operation than joint operation, and that the socialist system is inferior to the capitalist system, which is fundamentally different from the understanding of most people in industrial and commercial circles. He also hoped that people in industrial and commercial circles would continue to offer criticisms and suggestions on the work of the Party and the government.

    善意批评和右派谬论是两回事
    天津及时处理工商界正确意见
    九十条意见解决了五十一条
    改善了公私关系的人事安排
    新华社天津9日电　中共天津市委统战部、地方工业部和财贸部联合召开的工商界人士座谈会在8日结束。会上宣布工商界人士对党和政府工作提出的意见大部分已经作了处理。
    这个座谈会，是在5月29日开始的，到6月6日先后举行了九次会议，会上有四十四人发言。他们对资本主义工商业改造中的公私共事关系、人事安排等问题提出了九十件意见以后，座谈会休会了一个月，在这休会的时间内，有关党、政部门对所有意见一一进行了调查，截至目前已有五十一件意见及时地作了认真的解决。
    在座谈会上，天津市橡胶工业公司副经理李金昌提出，橡胶工业公司中公方经理和私方副经理分工不够明确。第一轻工业局和这个公司便进行了检查，并同公方经理和私方副经理共同研究，重新明确分工，公方经理负责生产计划、人事、技术检验等工作；私方副经理负责财务、供销、安全技术等工作。这个决定除在公司全体干部中宣布外，还在6月20日的党支部大会上进行传达，现在已经按职责分工执行日常工作。天津市工商联常委许子素提出天津市制药工业公司的私方人员的工作证上都没有填写职务，这是对私方人员不够尊重的表现。现在这个公司已在私方人员的工作证上，全部填写了本人职务。在对私方人员的安排问题上，天津油漆颜料工业公司副经理车重远提出，第二轻工业局将原勤华墨水厂经理赵云亭安排为文教用品工业公司当科员有缺点。经第二轻工业局了解和调查，认为赵云亭对供销业务有经验，已确定将赵云亭提升为这个公司供销科的副科长。公私合营第二中药总店经理刘华圃对个别公方代表有特权思想提出了意见，如第二中药总店住房问题十分困难，别人找不到住房，而公方副经理却占住了一个门市部的房子。现在，市药材公司已责成这位公方副经理搬到公司宿舍去住。
    在座谈会上不少人还对业务技术和增产节约等方面提出了有益的建议，如王光英提出近代化学厂应该采用六磅棉布代替十二磅棉布做漆布，可以大量节约，这个建议已经天津市计划委员会批准列入今年第三、四季度的生产计划。
    另有十七件意见，经有关部门调查研究，和事实有些出入，也已作了解释。
    在座谈会休会期间，还由参加会的工商界人士和有关政府部门组成四个小组，对座谈会提出的公私共事关系、生活福利互助金、私方人员摘“帽子”、社会活动和企业工作矛盾四方面的问题，进行了分析研究，并提出了一些建议。因为这些问题涉及面较广，一时不能解决或不是地方上能解决，这些问题也已分别转交本市或中央有关部门研究处理。
    这个座谈会在昨日宣布结束的时候，中共天津市委统战部部长王笑一讲了话。他说，在这次座谈会上，大家提的意见，大部分都很好，有关部门已经认真地作了处理，能解决的都解决了，一时不能解决的，也在进一步加以研究。全行业合营到现在，才不过一年多的时间，有些问题，都是在体现了合营企业优越性的基础上发生的。某些资产阶级右派分子认为企业实行合营不如私营，社会主义制度不如资本主义制度，这和大多数工商界人士的认识是有原则区别的。他还希望工商界人士对党和政府的工作，继续提出批评建议。
