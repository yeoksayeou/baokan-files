    Beijing People's Art Theatre
    Exposes the Sabotage Activities of Luo Longji's Henchmen
    (Our Newspaper News) All comrades of the Beijing People's Art Theatre have actively engaged in the anti-Rightist struggle, holding meetings and discussions in recent days to expose the anti-communist and anti-socialist speeches and activities of Dai Ya, the head of the China Democratic League group in the theatre, and League member Wen Yan. Under the direct instructions of Luo Longji, they took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to set fires everywhere, slandering the Party. In order to expand their anti-communist and anti-socialist strength, they vigorously developed their organization, attempting to "stand on an equal footing" with the Party, and plotting to dismantle the theatre under the guise of restoring the "China Traveling Theatre."
    According to the facts already revealed: after the start of the rectification movement, Luo Longji met with Wen Yan twice to give instructions in person. The first time, Luo Longji invited Wen Yan to his home for dinner, had Wen Yan report on the League's work in the theatre, and instructed Wen Yan: "You must develop greatly. Go back and draw up a list of those to be developed and send me a copy." Before Luo Longji went abroad, he received Wen Yan for the second time. When Wen Yan sent the development list for Luo to review, Luo Longji was very dissatisfied after looking at the list, saying, "Your work is too conservative. You should take advantage of the objective situation to develop vigorously. The performing arts circles have developed a lot, and the drama circles are lagging behind." He also said: "In the past, we developed the upper and middle classes. From now on, we must develop the middle and backward ones. You must convey this spirit when you go back." Luo Longji specifically suggested that the four actors in the play "Home for the New Year in a Blizzard" "can be developed," and also asked Wen Yan to convey a message to Dai Ya that he wanted to meet Dai Ya in person.
    According to Luo Longji's instructions, Dai Ya and Wen Yan planned to recruit all the theatre's main non-Party directors, actors, and some key administrative cadres into the League in order to create strength in the theatre and compete with the Party for leadership. They used the method of inciting discord between the Party and the masses to instigate some people to be dissatisfied with the Party and win them over to join the League. According to current revelations: they have already identified more than twenty development targets. As early as the winter of 1954, Dai Ya, in the name of the Democratic League group, proposed to the theatre that the Democratic League should have representatives participate in the theatre's administrative meetings and artistic meetings. In order to respect their opinions, the theatre invited Dai Ya to attend the administrative meetings and participate in the artistic meetings, but he was still not satisfied. He believed that these meetings were merely "consulting opinions," and that the "general policies" were "decided by the Party group," so he actually demanded to participate in the theatre's Party group meetings. Luo Longji's instructions to greatly develop the League were exactly what Dai Ya wanted. He wanted to immediately pull in a group of people to establish a League branch as "capital" for seizing leadership. Dai Ya specifically tried to bring Jiao Juyin into the League, and also pulled Mei Qian (a member of the China Association for Promoting Democracy) across party lines into the League. He said: "If I can pull Mr. Jiao over, then the League's position and my position will be different." Wen Yan, on the one hand, incited some actors to be dissatisfied with the leadership, and on the other hand, expressed that she wanted them to join the League. She also used despicable means to show small favors to the people they wanted to develop.
    While vigorously developing the organization, they also moved around, preparing to pull a group of people away from the theatre under the guise of restoring the "China Traveling Theatre," attempting to completely ruin the theatre. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Dai Ya served as the deputy head of the drama troupe of Hu Zongnan's War Cadre Regiment in Xi'an (Hu Zongnan was also the head of the regiment), with the rank of colonel and paid a major general's salary. On the one hand, he told people: "The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang is engaged in military affairs, and the Democratic League is engaged in cultural and educational affairs. We want to organize a theater troupe, and the Democratic League will give us money." On the other hand, he spread rumors: "The theatre lacks harmony, and the Party lacks Party spirit." The leaders are all "arrogant, hold great power, are stubborn and unyielding, and narrow-minded…", "The relationship between leaders and those led is not democratic. I led a theatre troupe for twenty years in the past, and there were also contradictions in the past theatre troupe, but they could be eliminated with emotion. Now all kinds of chiefs take office and are officials, who govern people, and the masses are the people, who are all governed." He also pretended to be suppressed in order to win sympathy, saying: "I am down on my luck, in decline, and every time I meet an old friend, I cannot help but shed tears. Under the eaves of others, how can I not bow my head." Shu Xiuwen revealed that when she first arrived at the theatre, Dai Ya told her how bad the theatre's leadership was. She questioned, "Why are you trying to incite discord like this?" Dai Ya also wrote a letter to Tian Chong of the theatre's Party group, inciting discord between the leaders. After Wen Yan came to the theatre, she took salary and was sick for nearly two years. The leadership took care of her in many ways. After she got better, she acted in many plays. Usually, she herself said that she was "happily too busy." But after the rectification movement, she said: "The new society is not as good as the old society," "The Party is the mother-in-law, the Youth League is the sister-in-law, and the Democratic League is the adopted daughter." She also slandered that the Party in the theatre was pitch black.
    At the symposium, everyone angrily exposed Dai Ya and Wen Yan's reactionary activities. Those who had been deceived by them in the previous period also woke up and exposed their reactionary words and deeds. The symposium is still going on, and everyone is pursuing the Rightists.

### 北京人民艺术剧院  揭发罗隆基爪牙的破坏活动

    北京人民艺术剧院
    揭发罗隆基爪牙的破坏活动
    本报讯　北京人民艺术剧院的全体同志，积极投入反右派斗争，连日来集会座谈，揭露该院的民盟小组长戴涯和盟员文燕的反共反社会主义的言论和活动。他们在罗隆基的直接指使下，利用党的整风，到处放火，对党进行诬蔑；为了扩大他们的反共反社会主义的实力，大力发展组织，想和党“分庭抗礼”，并企图恢复以“中国旅行剧团”为名，阴谋拆剧院的台。
    据现在已揭露的情况：整风开始后，罗隆基曾两次找文燕面授指示。第一次，罗隆基以请文燕到他家吃饭为名，让文燕汇报剧院盟的工作，指示文燕：“要大发展，你回去把要发展的名单拟出来送我一份。”罗隆基出国前，二次接见文燕，文燕送发展名单给罗审阅时，罗隆基看了名单后很为不满，说：“你们工作太保守了，应利用客观形势大力发展，曲艺界发展了许多，话剧界落后了。”又说：“以前我们发展中上层，今后要发展中间和落后的，你回去要传达这个精神。”罗隆基并具体提出“风雪夜归人”一戏里的四个演员“可以发展”，还叫文燕带话给戴涯，他要亲自接见戴涯。
    按照罗隆基的指示，戴涯、文燕计划把剧院主要的非党员导演、演员和部分主要行政干部全部网罗进去，以便在剧院造成实力，和党争领导权。他们用挑拨党群关系的办法，煽动某些人对党不满，争取他们入盟。据现在揭发的：他们物色的发展对象已有二十几人。戴涯早在1954年冬天，就用民盟小组的名义向剧院提出，民盟应该有代表参加剧院的院务会议和艺术会议。剧院为了尊重他们的意见，请戴涯列席了院务会议，参加了艺术会议，但他还不满足，他认为这些会议只不过是“征询一下意见而已”，至于“方针大计”都是党组“决定好了的”，所以他居然要求参加剧院的党组会。罗隆基大发展盟的指示，正中戴涯的下怀，他想马上拉一批人成立盟支部，作为夺取领导权的“资本”。戴涯特意去拉焦菊隐入盟，并拉梅阡（民主促进会会员）跨党入盟。他说：“我要把焦先生拉过来，那盟的地位和我的地位就不同了。”文燕一面煽动某些演员对领导不满，一面表示要他们入盟。她并用卑劣的手段，对他们要发展的人，施小恩小惠。
    他们在大力发展组织的同时，又到处活动，准备以恢复“中国旅行剧团”为名，计划从剧院拉走一批人，企图彻底把剧院搞垮。抗战时期，戴涯曾在西安胡宗南的战干团剧团当副团长（胡宗南兼团长），是上校衔，拿少将薪。他一方面对人说：“民革是搞军事的，民盟是搞文教的，我们要组织剧团，民盟给钱。”一方面，他散布：“剧院缺乏人和，党缺党性”，领导都是“飞扬跋扈、大权在握、顽固不化、心胸狭窄……”，“领导与被领导的关系不民主。我过去领导过二十年剧团，过去的剧团也有矛盾，但可以用感情消除。现在各种长走马上任是官，是治人的，群众是民，都是挨治的。”他还装作被压抑的样子，以博取同情说：“我潦倒了，没落了，每遇到老朋友我不得不老泪横流，在人廊檐下，怎能不低头。”舒绣文揭发，她刚到剧院，戴涯便对她说剧院领导如何如何不好。她质问：“为什么要这样挑拨？”戴涯并给剧院党组的田冲写信，挑拨领导之间的关系。文燕自来剧院后，便拿着薪金养了近两年的病，领导上对她多方照顾，病好后她演了不少戏，平时连她自己都说有“忙不过来的高兴”。但她在整风后，却说：“新社会不如旧社会”，“党是婆婆，团是小姑子，盟是童养媳妇”。并诬蔑剧院的党是一团漆黑。
    在座谈会上，大家非常愤怒地纷纷揭露戴涯、文燕的反动活动。前一时期曾被他们欺骗的人，也猛醒过来，揭发他们的反动言行。座谈会还在继续进行，大家正对右派分子进行追击。
