Market Round-Up

First Batch of Indian Sugar Arrives in China

To ease domestic sugar supply, China has ordered 50,000 tons of sugar from India and the United Kingdom. Recently, the first batch of Indian sugar has arrived in Tianjin.

The color of this imported sugar is similar to domestic "Pomegranate Flower" brand white sugar, but the grains are coarser.

This large-scale sugar import is the first transaction after the United Kingdom announced the relaxation of its embargo policy towards China. ·Zeng Tu·

What is Beijing's Refrigeration Capacity?

Last year, Beijing only had equipment to refrigerate over 1,000 tons of food. In February of this year, a cold storage facility capable of storing 4,500 tons of goods was completed. This means that the amount of goods Beijing can refrigerate this year has increased more than threefold compared to last year. The temperature of this cold storage facility is maintained at around -15 to 0 degrees Celsius. It ensures that Beijing citizens can eat fresh food during the hot summer months. During this year's May Day holiday, this cold storage facility released more than 10,000 frozen pork carcasses to supply the market.

By 1958, Beijing will have refrigeration equipment capable of storing 13,000 tons of goods. ·Lin·

Fuzhou Scented Tea Sends Out 500-600 Crates Daily

Jasmine and white magnolia flowers have already entered the market. Workers at the state-owned Fuzhou Tea Factory are producing various types of scented tea in large quantities. Currently, an average of 500-600 crates of scented tea are being shipped out of the factory every day. It is estimated that this year, Fuzhou will scent over 60,000 dan (石担) of jasmine tea, magnolia tea, pearl orchid tea, and extracted flower tea, to meet the needs of domestic and international markets.

In recent years, tea workers have continuously improved their operating methods and increased the production of new varieties such as Emei Flower Tea, Dragon Ball, and Special Grade Jasmine Tea. All types of scented tea produced in Fuzhou are of excellent quality. When brewed, the water is clear and bright, and the aroma is rich and fragrant. At the same time, the price is cheap, making it very suitable for the needs of the broad masses of working people. This year, Fuzhou scented tea has been sold to 27 provinces and cities across the country, and has also been exported to East Germany, Hungary, and Southeast Asian countries. ·Qi Hua·

Jiaoxian Cabbage Market Supply to Increase by 150% Compared to Last Year

Jiaoxian cabbage, one of Shandong's famous specialties, will supply 40 million jin to the whole country this year, an increase of 150% compared to last year.

Last year, "Jiao White" (胶白) production was reduced in some communes due to insufficient and untimely fertilizer supply, as well as natural disasters, with an average yield of only 6,000 jin per mu.

In order to meet the needs of people in various regions, the Jiaoxian People's Committee has increased the cabbage planting area from 10,285 mu last year to 13,000 mu this year, according to the production and sales plan. Relevant departments have allocated 3.75 million jin of oil cake indicators to various districts in mid-June and instructed them to distribute it to vegetable farmers as soon as possible. In this way, each commodity vegetable in the county's 10,000 mu can be fertilized with six liang of oil cake. It is estimated that this year's "Jiao White" yield per mu can reach 8,000 jin, and the total output will reach approximately 100 million jin. ·Gao Yongxin·

Produce More Straw Braid for Export

Straw braid is a traditional Chinese export commodity with a history of sales abroad for seventy or eighty years. Since liberation, the export volume has been expanding year by year. In addition to meeting the needs of fraternal countries, it is also sold to capitalist countries such as Japan, the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany.

In 1956, straw braid exports were nearly 20,000 packages, which could be exchanged for more than 14,000 tons of steel or more than 20,000 tons of fertilizer. The export portion purchased from farmers amounted to more than 5 million yuan, which can maintain the annual living expenses of 70,000 to 80,000 agricultural people. However, the current supply of goods is insufficient, especially fine braids, which cannot meet export needs.

It is hoped that producing areas can vigorously organize the production of straw braids and strive for export. ·Li Jun·

    首批印度砂糖运来我国
    为缓和国内砂糖供应，我国已向印度和英国订购了五万吨砂糖，最近，首批印度砂糖已运抵天津。
    这批进口砂糖的色泽与国产榴花牌白糖相近，但颗粒较粗。
    我国大量进口砂糖是在英国宣布放宽对华禁运政策以后首次成交的。　·曾土·
    北京的冷藏量有多大？
    去年，北京市仅有冷藏一千多吨食品的设备。今年2月，一个冷藏四千五百吨货物的冷冻库房建成了。就是说，北京市今年的冷藏货物的数量比去年增加了三倍多。这座冷藏库房的温度保持在摄氏零下十五度至零度左右。它保证供应北京市民在炎热的夏季能吃到鲜嫩的食品。今年五一节，这座冷藏库房拿出了一万多头冻猪肉供应市场。
    到1958年，北京市将有冷藏一万三千吨物资的冷藏设备。

      福州花茶每天外运五六百箱
    茉莉花、白玉兰花已经上市，国营福州茶厂制茶工人正在大量生产各类花茶，目前，平均每天出厂外运花茶将有五六百箱。据估计，今年福州将窨制茉莉花茶、玉兰花茶、珠兰花茶、抽花茶等六万多担，大量供应国内外市场需要。
    近年来，由于制茶工人不断改进操作方法，增加窨制了峨嵋花茶，龙团珠、特级茉莉花茶等新品种。福州所窨各类花茶品质都很优良，泡水清碧明净、香气馥郁，同时价格便宜，很适合广大劳动人民需要。今年，福州花茶已行销到全国二十七个省市，并且还运销民主德国、匈牙利及东南亚各国。　·琪华·
      胶县大白菜上市量将比去年增加倍半
    山东著名特产之一——胶县大白菜、今年将供应全国四千万斤，比去年增加一倍半。
    去年“胶白”因肥料不足和供应不及时，以及自然灾害的侵袭，致部分社减产，平均每亩产量仅达六千斤。
    胶县人民委员会为了满足各地群众的需要，今年根据产销计划将白菜播种面积由去年的一万零二百八十五亩扩大到一万三千亩；有关部门已在6月中旬将三百七十五万斤油饼指标分配到各区，并责成各区及早分配到菜农手里。这样全县一万亩商品菜每棵可施饼肥六两，预计今年“胶白”亩产量可达八千斤，总产量将达亿斤左右。

    生产更多的草帽辫出口
    草帽辫是我国传统的出口商品，行销国外已有七、八十年的历史。解放以后，外销数量逐年扩大，除供应兄弟国家需要以外，还销往日本、美、英、法、西德等资本主义国家。
    1956年草帽辫出口约近两万包，可换回一万四千多吨钢材或两万多吨肥田粉，向农民收购的出口部分金额达五百多万元，能维持七、八万农业人口全年的生活费用。但目前货源不足，特别是细辫很少，不能满足出口需要。
    希望产区能大力组织草帽辫的生产，争取出口。　·李浚·
