Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 20th that the Soviet Council of Ministers had examined the issue of the boundary of the Soviet inland sea in the Greater Peter Bay area and decided to use the straight line between the mouth of the Tumen River and Cape Povorotny as the boundary of the Soviet inland sea in this area and the baseline for calculating the breadth of Soviet territorial waters.

Greater Peter Bay is located outside Vladivostok, and Cape Povorotny is southeast of Vladivostok.

The decision stipulates that foreign ships and foreign aircraft must obtain permission from the relevant Soviet authorities to navigate and fly in the Greater Peter Bay area, with the exception of foreign ships entering and leaving the port of Nakhodka (located northwest of Cape Povorotny). Even in this case, foreign ships must travel along prescribed routes.
