    A Heart Red Through and Through
    Liu Dexin
    I thought of the story of an old comrade,
    On a golden, brilliant morning.
    It was autumn of 1936,
    He was wounded on the Qinghai-Gansu border.
    The regimental commander gave him a mule,
    Walking and walking, he lost contact and left the Fourth Red Army.
    Where had the troops gone? Where had the troops gone?
    Answering him was the rolling dust of the Loess Plateau.
    Staying here meant death,
    Going north to resist Japan summoned his heart.
    This lone sail in the sea of fog,
    Began to search for a beacon to point the way.
    What's there to fear in not finding the troops,
    Yan'an—
    Wasn't that the location of the Party Central Committee, the center of resistance against Japan?
    Go, towards Yan'an, even begging for food, he had to return!
    The dragon must return to the sea,
    The lone goose must find the flock.
    But he wasn't familiar with the route to Yan'an,
    Only knowing to cross the Yellow River eastward, a two-thousand-li journey.
    Without a map, without healthy legs,
    Difficulties, like a great mountain, blocked the road tightly.
    "Relying on the sun to distinguish direction, using the Great Wall as the road,"
    He advanced again, with the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers,
    A healthy heart!
    When the sun rose, he set out,
    When the sun went down, he camped;
    Tearing off his trouser legs to make a food bag,
    With no firewood to burn, he picked up cow dung,
    Begged for some wheat bran to eat, and took shelter from the wind in a sheep pen.
    Regardless of the maggots in his wound, regardless of his sunken eyes,
    With a bamboo stick, a heart red through and through,
    Forward! Forward! Forward!
    Finally, that day arrived:
    The Yellow River, in the sunlight,
    Welcomed this Red Army soldier who returned to the ranks, wounded and begging for food.
    I thought of the story of this old comrade,
    On this golden, brilliant morning.

    一颗红透的心
    刘德鑫
    我想起了一位老同志的故事，
    在一个金光灿烂的早晨。
    那是1936年的秋天，
    他负伤在青甘边境。
    团长给他一匹骡子，
    走着走着，失掉联系，离开了红四军。
    部队哪里去了？部队哪里去了？
    回答他的是黄土高原滚滚的风尘。
    留在这里等于死亡，
    北上抗日召唤着他的心。
    这只雾海的孤帆呵，
    开始寻找指点方向的标灯。
    找不到部队怕什么，
    延安——
    那不是党中央所在地，抗日的中心？
    走，向着延安，讨饭也得回去！
    蛟龙必须归大海，
    孤雁必须找雁群。
    可是到延安不熟悉路径，
    只知东渡黄河，两千里行程。
    没有地图，没有健康的腿，
    困难啊，像座大山把道路堵紧。
    “凭太阳辨别方向，以万里长城为道路”，
    他又前进了，用吞没山河的气魄，
    健康的心！
    太阳起床他出发，
    太阳下山他宿营；
    撕下裤管作饭口袋，
    没有柴烧捡牛粪，
    讨点麦麸吃，住进羊群的避风坑。
    不管伤口生了蛆，不管眼珠陷得深，
    凭一根竹棍，一颗红透的心，
    前进！前进！前进！
    终于呵，那末一天到了：
    黄河在阳光下
    迎接这个带伤讨饭归队的红军。
    我想起这位老同志的故事，
    在这金光灿烂的早晨。
