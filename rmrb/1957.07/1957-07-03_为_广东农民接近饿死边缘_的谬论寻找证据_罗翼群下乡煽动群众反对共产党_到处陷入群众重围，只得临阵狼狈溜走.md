Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 1st (Special Correspondent Xu Shi reports): Luo Yiqun, a representative figure of the bourgeois rightists in Guangdong Province and Deputy Director of the Provincial Counselor's Office, is using the guise of "inspection" to frantically incite students and peasants in Xingning, Pingyuan, Jiaoling and other counties in Guangdong Province against the leadership of the Communist Party. As of June 29th, although Luo Yiqun had been fiercely countered by the local masses, his anti-socialist activities had not yet been completely stopped as a result.

Since Luo Yiqun took advantage of the opportunity of the great blooming and contending to issue the fallacy of the so-called "Guangdong peasants approaching the brink of starvation," and successively received fierce rebuttals from all sides, he borrowed the name of "inspection" to go to his hometown of Xingning County and Pingyuan, Jiaoling and other counties to find materials for the "brink of starvation." He explained the motivation for this trip by saying: "Most people in the countryside are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, the relationship between cadres and the masses is very bad, and many people have written letters to me. I want to take them to Guangzhou and prepare to scold those who refuted my arguments." However, Luo Yiqun's "inspection" activities from June 11th, when he left Guangzhou, to the 29th, for a period of nineteen days, showed that Luo Yiqun not only went to the locally controlled elements, the representatives of the overthrown feudal forces, and some suspicious elements to collect materials on the "brink of starvation," but also further incited local students and peasants to carry out activities against the leadership of the Party.

In Baichi Township, Pingyuan County, Luo Yiqun convened more than two hundred people who were then attending the market and gave a speech inciting the masses. He said: The level of grain production in the mountainous areas is now much lower than in the past. What incentive do farmers have to produce? I published an article "Peasants Approaching the Brink of Starvation." I said that the peasants are now very poor and I sympathize with you. Do you think so? If you don't have enough to eat, get sick from hunger, and don't have money for medical treatment, you will starve to death. Isn't this the brink of starvation? He also ran to the Feitian Cooperative in that township and said to the members: The Communist Party attaches importance to national planning but not to people's livelihood. Grain requisitioning is too heavy, taxes are too high, and the prices of agricultural products are unreasonable. What can the farmers eat?

On the way from Xingning County to Pingyuan County, Luo Yiqun also gave a speech to the masses in Huangpi Market. He said: I am a democrat and I am not afraid of anything. You can reflect any opinions to me, or write letters to the hotel where I am staying. When Luo Yiqun arrived in his hometown of Longtian Township, Xingning County, he mobilized his relatives to collude with some people to hold two meetings to collect materials for the "brink of starvation."

On the 24th, Luo Yiqun burrowed into the ranks of students and teachers. He ran to Jiaoling No. 2 Middle School to "inspect." As soon as he arrived at the school, he asked: "Do your teachers eat porridge or rice?" The teacher said: "We eat rice." He immediately asked: "So it's two rice meals and one porridge meal?" The teachers said again: "All three meals are rice, and the students living in the school also eat three meals." Luo Yiqun also said to the students at a forum held at the school: "Students in Pingyuan County reported that in the old society, they were unemployed as soon as they graduated, and now they are also unemployed after graduation. Heh heh! Demobilized soldiers also go home to produce, heh heh!"

These activities of Luo Yiqun were applauded by the landlord Liu Juxiu and the controlled element Lin Luru in Pingyuan County. Lin Luru said to Luo Yiqun: "I very much agree with the article "Guangdong Peasants Approaching the Brink of Starvation" published by Mr. The people of our county are very supportive."

In Dupei Township, Xingning County, where Luo Yiqun had been, slogans welcoming Luo Yiqun such as "Down with the Communist bandits" and "The time is ripe for the peasants to reach the brink of starvation and take action to overthrow the Communist bandits!" have been discovered.

However, Luo Yiqun's anti-communist activities aroused the righteous indignation of the vast local masses. During the five days that Luo Yiqun was in Jiaoling County, he was completely surrounded by local peasants, students, and workers. On the 24th, faculty, staff, and students of Jiaoling No. 2 Middle School raised a series of questions to Luo Yiqun at a forum: "Why do you say that the people of Guangdong are approaching the brink of starvation?" On the 25th, No. 2 Middle School sent dozens of representatives to travel more than thirty miles to the county seat to invite Luo Yiqun to a forum, preparing to continue to refute his fallacy. But Luo Yiqun refused. The students sent representatives to visit his residence. These actions angered Luo Yiqun, and he loudly said: I will not answer the brink of starvation question. On the 26th, in addition to the teachers and students of No. 2 Middle School, staff from government organizations and teachers from Jiaoling No. 1 Middle School joined and invited Luo Yiqun to hold a five-hour forum. Luo Yiqun had no way to exonerate his fallacy, so he said: "When I said brink of starvation, I was referring to the city, not the countryside, and I was referring to the whole country, not your place." On the 28th, anger at rebuking the rightists flared up again in Jiaoling city. More than a thousand farmers, students, and workers held a forum in the Cultural Center. At the meeting, speaker after speaker refuted Luo Yiqun's fallacy. Rural woman Xiao Yongling said: There are thirty-four households in the first production team of the Northern Agricultural Cooperative in my village. Before liberation, everyone ate "monkey heads" and chaff cakes, not enough to eat and not warm enough to wear. Although we suffered several droughts after liberation, no one starved to death, and we were able to slaughter two big pigs every year. Xiao Yongling questioned Luo Yiqun and asked, where is the basis for your "brink of starvation?" Zhong Guangrong, a teacher at Jiaoling No. 2 Middle School, said: Luo Yiqun is standing on a reactionary position, using the name of caring for the lives of the masses, attempting to incite the people to oppose the Communist Party. The representatives who attended the meeting all unanimously stated that they can only live a happy life under the leadership of the Communist Party, and expressed that they will more firmly take the road of socialism. In a situation where he was at a loss for words, Luo Yiqun embarrassingly said: "There is absolutely no brink of starvation in Jiaoling." On the morning of the 29th, Luo Yiqun secretly left Jiaoling.

This Luo Yiqun, who once served as the director of the puppet Southern Route Administrative Office, cried loudly in front of Sun Yat-sen's portrait at a "Commemoration Week" held before Guangzhou's liberation, scolding Mr. Sun Yat-sen for not having vision and misusing Chiang Kai-shek, which led to the failure to eliminate the Communist Party. After liberation, he still called Chiang Kai-shek "Principal Chiang" and "Commander-in-Chief Chiang" in his autobiography. Even this year, when he spoke at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he openly called Chiang Kai-shek "Mr. Chiang." On June 5th of this year, at a symposium of the Provincial People's Committee, he again styled himself as a "champion for the farmers," saying that taxes were too heavy and the farmers' lives were difficult, and that the Communist Party should "lighten punishments and reduce taxes," trying to imply that "the people are not living," in an attempt to provoke the relationship between the Party and the people.

    为“广东农民接近饿死边缘”的谬论寻找证据
    罗翼群下乡煽动群众反对共产党
    到处陷入群众重围，只得临阵狼狈溜走
    本报特约新华社广州1日电  新华社记者许实报道：广东省资产阶级右派代表人物、省参事室副主任罗翼群，利用“视察”的名义，正在广东省兴宁、平远、蕉岭等县疯狂地煽动学生、农民反对共产党的领导。到6月29日为止，罗翼群虽然受到当地群众的猛烈回击，但是他的反社会主义的活动还没有因此而全部停止。
    罗翼群自从利用大鸣大放的机会发出所谓“广东农民接近饿死边缘”的谬论，接连受到各方面猛烈的回击以后，他便借“视察”名义，到他的家乡兴宁县以及平远、蕉岭等县去找“饿死边缘”的材料。他对此行的动机解释说：“农村大部分人对共产党不满，干部和群众关系很坏，有不少人给我写了信，我要把它带到广州去，准备痛骂驳我的论点的人。”但是，罗翼群自6月11日离开广州到29日为时十九天的“视察”活动表明：罗翼群不仅向当地的被管制分子、被斗垮的封建势力的代表人物以及一些可疑分子去搜集“饿死边缘”的材料，并且进一步煽动当地学生、农民进行反对党的领导的活动。
    罗翼群在平远县八尺乡曾召集当时正在赶集的二百多人，发表煽动群众的演说。他说：现在山区粮食生产水平比过去低很多了，农民还有什么生产积极性？我发表过“农民接近饿死边缘”的文章，我说农民现在很苦，我很同情你们，你们看看是吗？没得吃，饿到病，没钱医，就会饿死人的，这不是到了饿死的边缘吗？他又跑到那个乡的肥田社对社员们说：共产党重视国计，不重视民生，征粮过重，税收过多，农产品价格不合理，农民可吃什么呢？
    罗翼群自兴宁县到平远县的途中，又在黄陂圩向群众发表演说。他说：我是民主人士，什么也不怕，你们有什么意见可以向我反映，也可写信到我住的旅社去。罗翼群到了他的家乡兴宁县龙田乡，又动员了他的亲房串连了一些人开了两次会，来搜罗“饿死边缘”的材料。
    24日，罗翼群钻到学生、教师的队伍中了。他跑到蕉岭第二中学
  “视察”。一到学校，便开口问：“你们老师吃粥还是吃饭？”老师说：“我们吃饭。”他紧接着问：“那么是两饭一粥吧？”老师们又说：“三餐都吃饭，在学校住宿的学生也吃三餐饭。”罗翼群还在学校举行的一个座谈会上向学生说：“平远县的学生反映，旧社会毕业即失业，现在毕业也是失业。嘿嘿！复员军人也一样回家生产，嘿嘿！”
    罗翼群的这些活动受到平远县地主刘菊秀、被管制分子林禄如之流的喝采。林禄如对罗翼群说：“先生发表的广东农民接近饿死边缘一文，我很同意。我县人民都很拥护。”
    在罗翼群到过的兴宁县笃陂乡，已经发现了“打倒共匪”、“农民已到饿死边缘，行动起来打倒共匪的时机成熟了！”这样的欢迎罗翼群的标语。
    但是，罗翼群的反共活动却引起了当地广大群众的义愤。罗翼群在蕉岭县的五天当中，他就完全陷入了当地农民、学生、职工的重围之中。24日，蕉岭县第二中学教职员和学生在座谈会上向罗翼群提出了一连串的质问：“你为什么要说广东人民接近饿死的边缘？”25日，第二中学又派出了代表几十人远行三十多里路到县城邀请罗翼群座谈，准备继续驳斥他的谬论。但是被罗翼群拒绝了。学生们又派出代表到他的住地拜访。这些行动却激怒了罗翼群，他大声地说：我不回答饿死边缘问题。26日，除了二中师生外，又加上了机关职工、蕉岭一中老师，他们一起邀请罗翼群举行了五小时的座谈。罗翼群没有办法为他的谬论开脱，就说：“我说饿死边缘指的是城市并不是农村，是指全国不是指你们这里。”28日，蕉岭城里又燃起了反击右派的怒火。农民、学生、职工一千多人在文化馆举行座谈会。会上，发言人一个接连一个驳斥罗翼群的谬论。农村妇女萧永玲说：我村北方农业社第一生产队有三十四户，解放前大家吃“猴头”、糠粄，吃不饱，穿不暖，解放后虽然受几次旱灾，也没有饿死人，而且每年都能宰两条大猪。萧永玲质问罗翼群说，你的“饿死边缘”的根据在那里？蕉岭二中教师钟广荣说：罗翼群是站在反动的立场，假借关心群众生活为名，企图煽动人民反对共产党。到会的代表都一致表示：只有在共产党领导下才能过幸福的生活，表示要更坚定地走社会主义的道路。罗翼群在理屈词穷的情况下，狼狈地说：“在蕉岭没有到饿死的边缘，绝对没有。”29日清晨，罗翼群便偷偷地离开了蕉岭。
    这个曾经当过伪南路行署主任的罗翼群，在广州解放前夕举行的一次“纪念周”上，曾对着孙中山的遗像放声大哭，骂孙中山先生没有眼光，错用了蒋介石以致不能消灭共产党。解放以后，他在自传里还称蒋介石做“蒋校长”、“蒋总司令”。直到今年他在全国政协会议上发言时，还公开称蒋介石为“蒋先生”。今年6月5日在省人民委员会座谈会上，他又以“为农民请命”者自居，说税收过重，农民生活苦，要共产党“轻刑罚、薄税敛”，力图暗示“民不聊生”，以挑拨党和人民的关系。
