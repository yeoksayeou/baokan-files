Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: An article by Nikitin published in the Soviet "Pravda" on the 14th stated that in 1956, the total steel production of countries in the socialist camp reached over 68 million tons, pig iron reached over 50 million tons, coal mining reached 95.6 million tons, and electricity production had increased to 290 billion kilowatt-hours.

The article pointed out that the industrial output of these countries (whose territory accounts for more than 25% of the Earth’s land area and whose population accounts for about 35% of the world’s total population) currently accounts for about one-third of the world's total industrial output, and grain production accounts for about 40% of the world's total grain output.

Currently, the industrial output of the European People's Democratic countries has increased more than threefold compared to pre-war levels, and the industrial growth rate far exceeds that of the European capitalist countries. During the years of socialist construction, the most important industrial products of these countries have significantly increased per capita, and in many aspects, have exceeded the indicators of capitalist countries. For example, calculated per capita, France's power generation in 1955 increased by 2.3% compared to 1937, while Poland increased fivefold; Czechoslovakia increased threefold, equivalent to France's per capita electricity consumption level. Currently, Poland's coal mining volume per capita is 1.7 times more than France's. Czechoslovakia's steel production per capita has exceeded the levels of Italy, Sweden, and France.

The article stated that the economic cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries have promoted the economic development of these countries in many ways.

Foreign trade is one of the most important forms of economic cooperation between these countries, forming a socialist world market and greatly increasing the trade volume of countries in the socialist camp. For example, Poland's trade volume has increased by 1.2 times compared to pre-war levels, Romania by 1.6 times, Czechoslovakia by 2.2 times, Hungary by 2.4 times, and Bulgaria by 3 times. The trade volume of these countries with the Soviet Union is developing rapidly and smoothly. In 1956, the Soviet Union's share of Romania's trade volume was 47.6%, Albania 42.2%, the German Democratic Republic 41%, Czechoslovakia 31.8%, and Poland 27.5%.

The Soviet Union has provided enormous assistance to the industrialization of the European and Asian People's Democratic countries and the establishment of many new enterprises and certain industrial sectors. The Soviet Union provided these countries with complete sets of industrial equipment for 478 enterprises and exported to them large quantities of iron ore and manganese ore, machinery, steel, petroleum and petroleum products, cotton, grain, and other commodities. From 1950 to 1956, the Soviet Union's exports of iron ore to Czechoslovakia accounted for 74% of Czechoslovakia's imports, copper accounted for 70%, nickel accounted for about 90%, and aluminum accounted for 70%. During the same period, the Soviet Union provided Poland with 64% of Poland's iron ore imports, 49% of liquid fuel, 81% of cotton, and 43% of grain.

Mutual loans occupy an important position in the economic ties between socialist countries. In the years after World War II, the total amount of loans from the Soviet Union to the People's Democratic countries was over 28 billion rubles.

The article also discussed the scientific and technological cooperation between countries in the socialist camp, pointing out that this cooperation is a powerful means of accelerating the development of their productive forces.

    社会主义阵营生产力蓬勃增长
    钢产量去年达六千八百多万吨
    谷物产量约占世界总产量百分之四十
    新华社23日讯　苏联“真理报”14日发表尼基京的一篇文章说，1956年，社会主义阵营各国的钢总产量已经达到六千八百多万吨，生铁达到五千多万吨，采煤量达到九万五千六百万吨，电力产量已经增加到二千九百亿度。
    文章指出，这些国家（它们的领土占地球陆地面积的25％以上，人口约占世界总人口35％）的工业产量目前已经大约占世界工业总产量的三分之一，谷物产量约占世界谷物总产量的40％。
    现在，欧洲各人民民主国家的工业产量已经比战前增加了三倍以上，工业增长速度大大超过欧洲各资本主义国家。在社会主义建设的年代里，这些国家的最重要的工业产品按人口平均计算有了显著的增加，在许多方面已经超过了资本主义国家的指标。例如，按人口平均计算，1955年法国的发电量比1937 年增加了2.3％，而波兰却增加了五倍；捷克斯洛伐克增加了三倍，相当于法国按人口平均用电量的水平。现在，波兰的采煤量按人口平均计算比法国多一点七倍。捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量按人口平均计算已经超过意大利、瑞典和法国的水平。
    文章说，社会主义各国的经济合作和互助，在许多方面促进了这些国家的经济发展。
    对外贸易是这些国家之间经济合作的最重要的形式之一，它形成了社会主义世界市场，并且大大增加了社会主义阵营各国贸易额。例如，波兰的贸易额比战前增加了一点二倍，罗马尼亚增加了一点六倍，捷克斯洛伐克增加了二点二倍，匈牙利增加了二点四倍，保加利亚增加了三倍。这些国家同苏联的贸易额迅速地、顺利地发展着。1956年，苏联在罗马尼亚的贸易额中所占的比重为47.6％，在阿尔巴尼亚占42.2％，在德意志民主共和国占41％，在捷克斯洛伐克占31.8％，在波兰占27.5％。
    苏联对欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家工业化和许多新企业和某些工业部门的建立给予了巨大的援助。苏联为这些国家提供了四百七十八个企业的整套工业设备，并且向它们出口大量的铁矿和锰矿、机器、钢材、石油和石油制品、棉花、谷物和其他商品。1950年到1956年，苏联向捷克斯洛伐克出口的铁矿砂，占捷克斯洛伐克进口的74％，铜占70％，镍占90％左右，铝占70％。在同一时期内，苏联提供波兰的铁矿砂占波兰进口的64％，液体燃料占49％，棉花占81％，谷物占43％。
    在社会主义国家之间的经济联系中，互相贷款占有重要地位。在第二次世界大战以后的年代里，苏联给人民民主国家的贷款总数在二百八十亿卢布以上。
    文章还谈到了社会主义阵营各国之间的科学技术合作，指出这方面的合作是加速发展它们的生产力的强有力的手段。
