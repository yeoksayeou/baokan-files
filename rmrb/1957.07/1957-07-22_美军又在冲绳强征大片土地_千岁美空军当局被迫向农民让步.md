Xinhua News Agency, Naha, July 20th: The US military engineering corps stationed in Okinawa announced on July 18th that it will seize approximately 1.71 million "ping" (approximately 1,400 acres) of land in northern Okinawa to expand its military base.

This is the largest land seizure by the US military in Okinawa since it announced land seizure orders not long ago. On June 18th, the United States forcibly seized 400 acres of land from local residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 20th: The US military authorities at the Chitose Air Force Base in Hokkaido have been forced to agree to move a bombing practice range away from the house of Japanese farmer Kenosuke Nozaki and cancel the bombing exercises originally scheduled to begin there on July 22nd.

Nozaki Kenosuke had originally decided to sit in front of the bombing practice range during the bombing exercises, prepared to protest at the cost of his life. Many workers and students decided to support him.

However, the US military authorities rejected Nozaki Kenosuke's demand for compensation of 10 million yen. He pointed out that the US military aircraft's bombing exercises had caused his family much economic loss and damage to the health of its members.

    美军又在冲绳强征大片土地
    千岁美空军当局被迫向农民让步
    新华社20日讯　那霸消息：驻在冲绳的美军工兵队7月18日宣布，它又将在冲绳北部征用约一百七十一万坪（约合一千四百英亩）土地来扩充军事基地。
    这是冲绳美军在不久以前宣布征用土地令以来征用土地最多的一次。美国在6月18日曾经向当地居民强征四百英亩土地。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：北海道美军千岁空军基地当局已经被迫同意将一个轰炸演习场从日本农民野崎健之助的房子附近移走，并且取消了原订从7月22日在那里开始举行的轰炸演习。
    野崎健之助本来决定在这次轰炸演习中坐在轰炸演习场前面，准备以牺牲生命来表示抗议。许多工人、学生决定去支援他。
    但是美军当局拒绝了野崎健之助提出的赔偿一千万日元的要求。他曾经指出，美军飞机的轰炸演习使他的家庭在经济上和成员的健康上受到许多损失。
