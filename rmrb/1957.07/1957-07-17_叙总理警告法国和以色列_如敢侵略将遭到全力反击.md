Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 16th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said yesterday that France and Israel may be considering "a large-scale invasion of Syria like the invasion of Egypt last November."

Al-Asali made these remarks when commenting on reports of French and Israeli troops gathering near the southern border of Syria. He warned, "Any Israeli aggression against Syria supported by France will be met with full retaliation."

The Prime Minister rejected the proposal made by Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy on American television on the 14th, that he was willing to mediate the dispute between Arab countries and Israel. He said, "The Arabs are determined not to make any concessions on the issue of their rights in Palestine. We will restore this right in the future at any cost."

Meanwhile, Marouf al-Dawalibi, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Syrian Parliament, condemned Suhrawardy's proposal on the same day as "imperialist propaganda." He told the press that Suhrawardy had violated Pakistan's long-standing policy of supporting the Arabs on the Palestine issue.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, who had just returned from a visit to Yugoslavia, also criticized Suhrawardy's proposal on the 15th. He said, "We are very surprised that he would make such a statement, especially after we discussed this issue with him in detail during President Kuwatli's visit to Pakistan."

Bitar, who returned to Damascus via Cairo on the 13th, spoke of Egyptian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Amer's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, saying that Amer's talks with the Saudi King were "successful and will produce positive results."

Bitar said that the crisis between Syria and Saudi Arabia is coming to an end. He expressed confidence that relations between Arab countries would be improved to overcome the imperialist conspiracies against Arab countries.

Bitar also announced that Yugoslav President Tito and the Foreign Minister had accepted invitations to visit Syria. The visit is likely to take place in the winter.

    叙总理警告法国和以色列
    如敢侵略将遭到全力反击
    新华社大马士革16日电　叙利亚总理阿萨利昨天说：法国和以色列可能在考虑“像去年11月侵略埃及那样大规模侵略叙利亚”。
    阿萨利是在评论一项关于法国和以色列军队在叙利亚南部边界一带集结的消息时这样说的。他警告说：“以色列对叙利亚发动任何有法国支持的侵略都将遭到全力回击。”
    这位总理拒绝了巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底14日在美国电视广播中提出的他愿意调解阿拉伯国家和以色列的纠纷的建议。他说：“阿拉伯人下定决心在关于他们在巴勒斯坦的权利问题上决不作任何让步。我们将来要不惜任何代价来恢复这种权利。”
    同时，叙利亚议会外交委员会副主席马鲁夫·达瓦利比在同一天谴责苏拉瓦底的建议是“帝国主义宣传”。他对报界说：苏拉瓦底违背了巴基斯坦在巴勒斯坦问题上支持阿拉伯人的长期的政策。
    刚刚从南斯拉夫访问归来的叙利亚外交部长比塔尔也在15日抨击了苏拉瓦底的建议。他说：“我们非常惊奇他竟会发表这种言论，特别是在库阿特利总统访问巴基斯坦期间我们同他详细讨论了这个问题以后。”
    比塔尔是在13日经开罗回到大马士革的。他谈到埃及武装部队总司令阿密尔最近对沙特阿拉伯的访问说：阿密尔同沙特国王这次会谈“是成功的，并且将产生积极的结果”。
    比塔尔说：叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯之间的危机正在结束中。他表示相信阿拉伯国家之间的关系将得到改善，以克服帝国主义对阿拉伯国家的阴谋。
    比塔尔还宣布南斯拉夫总统铁托和外交部长已经接受了访问叙利亚的邀请。访问大概将在冬季进行。
