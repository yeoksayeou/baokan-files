In the Critical Moment of Struggle, Yuan Yongxi Betrayed the Communist Stance and Acted as an Accomplice for Rightists Attacking the Party

This paper reports that Yuan Yongxi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Tsinghua University Party Committee (former First Secretary of the Party Committee) and Assistant to the President, fully exposed his rightist features during the critical stage of the anti-rightist struggle by collaborating with bourgeois rightists in their frenzied attacks on the Party.

Using His Leadership Position to Peddle Private Agendas, Spread Rumors, and Undermine the Unity of the Leadership Core

A large amount of material exposed during the recent plenary meeting of the Tsinghua University Party Committee fully proves that Yuan Yongxi, during the rectification movement, used his leadership position to peddle private agendas, purposefully distorted and slandered the Party Central Committee's policies, and spread rumors within the Party to undermine the unity of the Party's leadership core. Under Yuan Yongxi's leadership and influence, several important Party strongholds on the ideological front—the Party organization of the Marxist-Leninist political theory teaching and research group, the Tsinghua Party Committee Propaganda Department, the school newspaper "New Tsinghua," and the Party General Branch of the Electrical Engineering Department—were disarmed in the struggle, collapsing or becoming paralyzed. The Party branch of the Marxist-Leninist political theory teaching and research group, directly led by Yuan Yongxi, instead of defending the Marxist-Leninist ideological front and adhering to the Party's stance during the serious class struggle, stood on the side of the bourgeois rightists and became the vanguard in attacking the Party.

Yuan Yongxi's attitude toward the rectification movement was ulterior. He attempted to use the Party's rectification and the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy to achieve personal goals. He had long harbored dissatisfaction with the Party organization and the leaders of the Party Committee. On the eve of the rectification movement, he privately stated, "After studying (the three-month off-the-job study for senior cadres of the Municipal Party Committee), I have become bolder, and I must seize the opportunity to really let loose." When Liu Bing, the first deputy secretary of the Party Committee, criticized him for not being active in his work, he retorted, "I will rise up and fight." He had always been passive, unresponsive, and irresponsible towards the work of the school and the Party, but suddenly became active on the eve of the rectification. He showed no interest in the specific work he should be responsible for, but expressed a desire to specifically study the issue of "how the school should let loose." Because he harbored bourgeois individualistic ambitions, he told Guo Daohui, the head of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee, who was influenced by his ideas, "If this rectification does not go well, I will become passive." After the People's Daily published an editorial countering the rightists, he purposefully distorted and slandered the Central Committee's policy. He told several comrades close to him: Chairman Mao is under great pressure, the situation at home is urgent, and telegrams are pouring in, all demanding a retraction. Yuan Yongxi's viewpoint was identical to the basic idea of the reactionary leaflet "Our Worries and Appeals" issued by the rightists at Peking University.

Yuan Yongxi used the serious right-leaning thoughts and bourgeois liberalistic habits of some comrades to engage in small-group activities within the Party, spreading distrust of the Party Committee and dissatisfaction with the leaders of the Party Committee. His anti-Party remarks and activities spread widely among a considerable number of cadres within the Party, causing serious destructive effects, so that at the critical moment of class struggle, the unity and solidarity of the Tsinghua Party organization were undermined, the Party ranks were paralyzed, and even the Party Committee could not function normally.

Refusing to Implement the Party's Policies, Leading the Party Organizations He Led Astray According to His Personal Intentions, and Collaborating with Rightists to Start Fires Everywhere

Yuan Yongxi deliberately refused to implement the Party's policies, leading the Party organizations he led astray according to his personal intentions. He harbored a malicious glee toward the rightists' attacks. During the rightists' rampant attacks, Yuan Yongxi, as a key leading cadre within the Party, deliberately turned a blind eye to this surging and malicious anti-communist tide. He propagated to the comrades around him: "There are no political issues at Tsinghua." The problem at Tsinghua is that the leadership is divorced from the masses, cannot understand the emotions of the masses, and does not sincerely examine its mistakes. "The rectification is to transform the leadership, not to rectify the masses." The rightists of the Marxist-Leninist political theory teaching and research group launched successive frenzied attacks on the Party, opposing the Marxist-Leninist political theory course as a required course in the school, opposing the Party Committee's leadership of the political theory course, posting big-character posters attacking the Party Committee for lacking determination in rectification, slandering the Party Committee for suppressing free expression, and demanding the removal of the Communist Youth League Secretary Ruan Ming. Yuan Yongxi expressed appreciation and unreserved support for these murky actions. He repeatedly instructed the Party branch of the political teaching and research group: "Your situation is basically normal, you are letting loose well, keep doing it like this!"

During the most rampant period of the rightists' attacks, Yuan Yongxi and the comrades influenced by him colluded from within and without to cooperate with the rightists, starting fires everywhere and attacking the Party. Yuan Yongxi's attack on the Party was "tactical." He did not say a word at the Standing Committee meetings during this period, using the excuse of attending meetings at the grassroots level to avoid frontal debates, and advised the comrades influenced by him to "not argue with them (referring to the leaders of the Party Committee), wait and see." But below, he was very active. His main tactic was to deliberately provoke the Party members' dissatisfaction with the leadership core of the Party Committee and the comrades who adhered to the Party's policies, and to direct the spearhead of the attack towards these comrades. He slandered the main leaders of the Party Committee with different statements, such as: "So-and-so is puffed up with anger at the Standing Committee meeting, so-and-so is holding back a bellyful of anger." "So-and-so is under great pressure, very nervous, and dare not let loose." "So-and-so should be thoroughly rectified this time," "These people are not humble and unwilling to examine themselves."

Attempting to Use the Support of Rightists Outside the Party to Achieve the Personal Goal of Attacking the Party Committee and Elevating Himself

Many of Yuan Yongxi's words and deeds among the masses lost the stance of a Communist Party member. At the free forum sponsored by the trade union, when the rightists shouted slanderous slogans such as "Oppose the privileges of the Communist Party," he actually applauded along with the masses. When the counter-revolutionary elements of the school's Jin Factory distorted the facts and "accused" the Party branch secretary of the Jin Factory, Yuan Yongxi praised the counter-revolutionary element's opportunism as achieving the "advanced level" of "speaking out."

Yuan Yongxi's mistakes in this rectification movement were not general ideological errors, but an extremely egregious anti-Party behavior. After the first Party Congress of Tsinghua University in 1956, Yuan Yongxi was not elected as the Secretary of the Party Committee due to his historical errors. From then on, he became irresponsible in his work, ideologically passive and declining, completely falling into the quagmire of individualism. He used excuses to shirk and ignore the work assigned by the Party, or was passive and unresponsive. For a long time, he secretly rivaled the Tsinghua Party Committee and competed for leadership prestige. He hoped to take advantage of this rectification opportunity, using the slogan he fabricated that the rectification was to "oppose the three evils and transform the leadership"; and using the support of the rightists inside and outside the Party during the rectification movement, to achieve his personal goal of attacking the Tsinghua Party Committee and elevating himself.

Yuan Yongxi has fairly deep revisionist ideas in politics, and there are many principled differences with the Tsinghua University Party Committee. He opposed the assertion that "the teaching reform is a struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road." He believes that "there are no major policy issues in school work, only specific work." He one-sidedly emphasized unity on the issue of senior intellectuals, denying the necessity of struggle; on the issue of students' ideological education, he opposed class analysis and emphasized emotional education. He also has serious right-leaning ideas on the issue of counter-revolutionaries; on the issue of Party building, he has bourgeois liberal tendencies, and inappropriately emphasizes in Party classes that "admission to the Party should be based on academic scores, and only those who study well can join the Party." His words have fueled erroneous views among students such as "good grades mean good politics" and "talent is equivalent to virtue."

Yuan Yongxi's series of mistakes are not accidental, but have his class roots and historical roots. He was born into an exploiting-class family, and after joining the Party in 1939, the ideological consciousness of the exploiting class was not fundamentally transformed. During the democratic revolution, he committed a serious error of political wavering in front of the enemy, surrendering after being arrested. He was expelled from the Party in 1949 and rejoined the same year. At the critical moment of the socialist revolution, he once again colluded with the rightists to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, completely losing the political stance of a Communist Party member.

    在斗争的紧要关头背叛共产主义立场
    袁永熙作了右派分子进攻党的内应
    本报讯　清华大学党委常委（上届党委第一书记）、校长助理袁永熙，在反右派斗争的紧要关头，配合资产阶级右派分子向党进行猖狂的进攻，充分暴露了他的右派分子的面目。
    利用领导身份贩运私货，散布流言蜚语，破坏领导核心的团结
    最近清华大学党委会全体会议上揭发的大量材料，充分证明袁永熙在整风运动中，利用自己的领导身份贩运私货，别有用心地歪曲和诬蔑党中央的方针，在党内散播流言蜚语，破坏党内领导核心的团结。在袁永熙的领导和影响下，党在思想战线上的几个重要阵地——马列主义政治课教研组的党组织、清华党委宣传部、校刊新清华、电机系的党总支等都在斗争中被解除了武器，陷于瓦解或瘫痪状态。袁永熙直接领导的马列主义政治理论课教研组的党支部，在严重的阶级斗争中，他们竟不是去保卫马列主义的思想阵地，坚持党的立场，相反，却站在资产阶级右派分子方面，成为向党进攻的急先锋。
    袁永熙对整风运动的态度是别有用心的，他企图利用党的整风和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针来达到个人的目的。他对党组织和党委领导同志长期存在不满情绪。整风运动前夕，他就在私下表示“我经过学习（市委高级干部脱产三个月的学习）以后，胆子壮了，有机会也要好好放一下”。当党委第一副书记刘冰同志批评他工作不积极时，他反而说“我要起来战斗”。他对学校和党的工作一贯消极被动不负责任，整风前夕突然积极起来。他对自己应该负责的具体工作不感兴趣，而表示要专门研究“学校如何放”的问题。由于他抱有资产阶级个人主义的企图，所以他对接受他的思想影响的党委宣传部长郭道辉说：“如果这次整风不好，我就要消极下去。”他在整风开始以后，就暗暗煽火，强调要“放”。在人民日报发表了反击右派的社论以后，他还别有用心地歪曲和诬蔑中央的方针，他对接近他的几位同志说：毛主席受到很大的压力，国内告急，电报雪片飞来，都要求收。袁永熙的这个观点，同北京大学右派分子所发出的反动传单“我们的忧虑和呼吁”的基本思想，如出一辙。
    袁永熙利用部分同志的严重右倾思想和资产阶级自由主义习气，在党内进行小组织活动，散布对党委的不信任情绪和对党委领导同志不满的情绪。他这种反党的言论和活动在党内相当一部分干部中广泛流传，发生了严重的破坏性的影响，以至在阶级斗争的紧要关头，破坏清华党组织的团结和统一，瘫痪了党的队伍，甚至使党委会不能正常地进行工作。
    拒绝执行党的方针，按照私人意图把他所领导的党的组织引入歧途，配合右派分子，到处点火
    袁永熙故意拒绝执行党的方针，按照自己私人的意图把他所领导的党组织引入歧途。他对右派分子的进攻抱着幸灾乐祸的心情。在右派分子的猖狂进攻下，身为党内主要领导干部的袁永熙，竟对这种汹涌恶毒的反共逆流故意熟视无睹。他向他周围的同志宣传：“清华没有什么政治性问题”，清华的问题就是领导脱离群众，不能体会群众情绪，不虚心检讨错误，“整风就是要改造领导，不是要整群众”。马列主义政治理论课教研组的右派分子接连对党发动猖狂进攻，反对马列主义政治理论课程作为学校必修课程，反对党委领导政治理论课，贴大字报攻击党委整风无决心，诬蔑党委压制鸣放，要求将团委书记阮铭撤职。对于这些乌烟瘴气的行动，袁永熙却表示欣赏和无保留的支持。他对政治教研组党支部一再指示：“你们的情况基本正常，放的好，就这样做下去！”
    在右派分子进攻最猖狂的时期，袁永熙和受他影响的同志里应外合地配合右派分子，到处点火，向党进攻。袁永熙向党进攻是有“策略”的。他在这段时期的党委常委会议上不发一言，借口到基层去参加会议，逃避正面争论，并劝受他影响的同志“不要和他们（指党委领导同志）争，等一等再看。”但在下面他却大肆活动。他进攻的主要手法，就是故意挑起党员对党委领导核心和坚持党的方针的同志的不满情绪，把进攻的矛头引向这些同志。他用不同的说法诬蔑了党委的主要领导同志，如说：“某某人在常委会上气鼓鼓，某某人憋着一肚子气。”“某某人压力大，很紧张，不敢放。”“某某人应该在这次好好整一整”，“这些人就是不虚心，不肯检讨。”
    企图借党外右派分子的支援来达到打击党委抬高自己的个人目的
    袁永熙在群众中的许多言行丧失了共产党员的立场。在工会主办的自由论坛上，当右派分子高呼“反对共产党的特权”等等诬蔑性的口号时，他竟跟着群众一起鼓掌。当校内金工厂的肃反被斗分子歪曲事实，“控诉”金工厂的党支部书记时，袁永熙却称赞这位肃反被斗分子的乘机报复是达到“鸣、放”的“先进水平”。
    袁永熙在这次整风运动中的错误，不是一般思想认识上的错误，而是一种极为恶劣的反党行为。在1956年清华大学第一次党代表大会以后，袁永熙因历史上有错误，未被选为党委书记，他从此对工作不负责任，思想上消极衰退，完全陷入个人主义的泥坑，对党分配的工作，借口推托不管，或是消极被动不闻不问。好久以来，他暗中同清华党委分庭抗礼，竞争领导威信。他希望借此次整风的机会，借他所捏造的整风是要“反对三害，改造领导”的口号；借整风运动中党内外右派分子的支援，来达到他打击清华党委和抬高自己的个人目的。
    袁永熙在政治上存在着相当深的修正主义思想，同清华大学党委之间有许多原则性的分歧。他反对“教学改革是资本主义教育和社会主义教育两条道路的斗争”的提法。他认为“学校工作没什么大的方针问题，只有具体工作”。他对高级知识分子问题片面强调团结，否认必要的斗争；在学生思想教育工作问题上，他反对阶级分析，强调情感教育。在肃反问题上，他也有严重的右倾思想；在党的建设问题上，他有资产阶级自由主义的倾向，在党课中不适当地强调“入党要以学习分数为标准，学习好才能入党”。他的这些话，在学生中助长了“业务好，就是政治好”，“才好即德好”等错误观点。
    袁永熙的一系列错误不是偶然的，是有他的阶级根源和历史根源的。他出身于剥削阶级家庭，1939年入党后，剥削阶级的思想意识没有得到根本改造。在民主革命时期他就在敌人面前犯了政治动摇的严重错误，被捕以后自首，1949年开除党籍，同年又重新入党。在社会主义革命的紧要关头，他又配合右派分子向党猖狂进攻，完全丧失了共产党员的政治立场。
