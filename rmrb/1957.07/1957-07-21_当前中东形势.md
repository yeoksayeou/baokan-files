Current Middle East Situation
    Gu Si
    The characteristic of the current Middle East situation is that after replacing Britain in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism is actively expanding its aggressive forces, attacking and isolating Egypt and Syria, which adhere to anti-colonial policies, and dividing Arab countries in order to smoothly implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine." This aggressive activity by the United States has hindered the easing of the Middle East situation, creating a situation where one wave subsides only for another to rise. The U.S.-orchestrated Jordan incident has just come to an end, and tensions are now emerging between Israel and Syria. Peace in the Middle East is once again under serious threat.

    The Focus of the Struggle—Syria
    The recent Israeli armed provocations on the Syrian border are by no means accidental. This is a signal that the United States is launching its plot to subvert the current Syrian government.

    The United States has always regarded the nationalist governments of Egypt and Syria as the main obstacles to its rule in the Middle East and wants to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The first step for the United States is to isolate Syria and Egypt. The Jordan incident was to achieve this goal. After the Jordan incident, Syria was surrounded by countries that either belonged to the Baghdad Pact or were ruled by pro-American forces. The United States believes that this situation is conducive to subverting the current Syrian government. This is the second step the United States is now taking. If this step succeeds, Egypt will be isolated, and the United States can then turn to deal with Egypt. As early as after the Jordan incident, U.S. newspapers openly stated that the Jordan incident was the "first step" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and the "next crisis" would fall on Syria.

    Since the end of the Suez Crisis, the United States has been colluding with other imperialist countries to exert various pressures on Syria. In economic terms, Syria has had a bumper wheat harvest this year due to sufficient rainfall, with estimated wheat exports reaching 300,000 to 400,000 tons. Barley production has also far exceeded previous years. However, on the one hand, world wheat prices have fallen sharply due to the impact of U.S. wheat dumping; on the other hand, the United States has viciously seized Syria's traditional wheat market, selling hundreds of thousands of tons of wheat to Italy at low prices and with very favorable terms. This has created serious difficulties for the Syrian economy. France, which has always been the main buyer of Syrian cotton, has now stopped purchasing. The aim of imperialism is to incite the dissatisfaction of Syrian landlords and the bourgeoisie with the current government by creating economic difficulties for Syria.

    The Jordan incident and Syria's economic difficulties have encouraged pro-Western forces in Syria, who are eager to try. However, due to the strength of Syria's patriotic forces, several attempts by pro-Western forces have failed. In this situation, the United States is attempting to use the contradictions between Israel and Arab countries to achieve the goal of subverting Syria.

    From what has been revealed, the U.S. conspiracy is being carried out in two ways: on the one hand, organizing a coup with the pro-American fascist party—the Syrian Social Nationalist Party—and other right-wing forces as the core, while smuggling weapons into Syria and inciting riots in northwestern Syria, southern mountainous areas, and the central desert region; on the other hand, the United States is directing Israel to carry out provocations on the Syrian border, contain the Syrian army, and use external forces to influence domestic coups. If this proves difficult, Israel will invade Syria, and pro-American Lebanon, Jordan, etc., will use the excuse of supporting Syria to send their troops into Syria to influence the political situation in Syria.

    This U.S. conspiracy has received the support of France. There are reports that French troops have been concentrated in Israeli territory near the Syrian border. France once exercised colonial rule in Syria, and it is interested in taking advantage of this opportunity to share a piece of the pie in the Middle East with the United States. It is also very willing to isolate Egypt by subverting Syria, so that its suppression of the Algerian people can be more convenient.

    Due to this U.S. conspiracy, the situation in the Middle East is now becoming tense again. But the Syrian people are determined to resist aggression. The Syrian government has warned Israel and the imperialists that if they dare to act rashly, Syria will retaliate with all its strength. The Syrian army is now on high alert on the border, preparing to repel attacks from any direction. The Syrian government's resolute attitude has received the support of peace-loving people around the world. This will certainly make Israel and the imperialists have to consider the serious lessons of the Suez War.

    The United States Attempts to Consolidate Its Position in the Middle East

    The reason why the United States is so actively trying to subvert Syria is to further consolidate the position it has gained in the Middle East since the Bermuda Conference. After the Anglo-American Bermuda Conference in March of this year, the United States seized the opportunity to carry out a major expansion in the Middle East. The United States not only wooed Lebanon and Saudi Arabia on the southern front of the Middle East, and orchestrated the Jordan incident, causing Jordan to lean towards the United States, but also, on the northeastern front, placed the member states of the Baghdad Pact under U.S. control by joining the military committee of the Baghdad Pact and allocating $12.5 million in "aid" to the treaty countries. The United States also took this opportunity to actively expand its military bases in the Middle East. In Jordan, the British Royal Air Force had just withdrawn from the Mafraq Air Base near the Syrian border when the United States immediately replaced it, gaining control of the base. In Lebanon, there are also reports that secret negotiations to allow the United States to obtain land and naval bases have long been underway, and in fact, the Sixth Fleet has already used Beirut as its base in recent activities interfering in Middle Eastern affairs.

    At the same time, the United States is intensifying its control over countries that have already fallen into its trap, consolidating its gains. After the Jordan incident, the United States has been trying its best to encourage the Jordanian court to continue suppressing patriotic forces. The U.S. Ambassador to Amman even submitted a blacklist of patriotic figures to the current Jordanian government and planned to relocate hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arab refugees with strong anti-imperialist sentiments living in Jordan to Iraq in order to remove obstacles to Jordan's complete embrace of the United States. Recently, the United States decided to provide $20 million in economic and military "aid" to support the Jordanian court. In Lebanon, the United States has shipped a large amount of military supplies to Beirut to strengthen pro-American forces in Lebanon. In early June, the United States further controlled the Baghdad Pact, making it serve the "Eisenhower Doctrine," through the Karachi meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council, and also actively attempted to put together a so-called Eastern Arab anti-communist group including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Lebanon. At the same time, many reports have revealed that the United States is secretly trying to get some pro-Western Arab countries to reach a secret reconciliation with Israel, breaking the Arab countries' common policy on the Palestinian issue. In the eyes of the United States, if the conspiracy to subvert Syria can be realized, the entire West Asia region will become a prize in the United States' pocket.

    Open Strife and Covert Struggles Between the United States and Britain

    The expansion of the United States in the Middle East has not only been opposed by the people of the Middle East, but has also intensified contradictions within imperialism, mainly between the United States and Britain. Some powerful factions within the British ruling group have already revealed deep anti-American sentiments because of this. The powerful Churchill-Salisbury group has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the United States' actions in the Middle East, which is proof of this.

    In order to reverse the impact of the failure of the invasion of Egypt and to protect its interests in oil, trade, shipping, and bases in the Middle East, Britain has begun to take some measures of retreating in order to advance, attempting to reorganize the Baghdad Pact organization and ease anti-British sentiment in the Arab world in order to counter the expansion of U.S. power in the Middle East.

    After facing reality and announcing the use of the Suez Canal, the British government sent representatives to Rome to hold preliminary talks with Egyptian representatives aimed at restoring Anglo-Egyptian economic relations. Britain is clearly planning to take advantage of the growing contradiction between the United States and Arab nationalism to gradually restore normal relations between Britain and Egypt and Syria in order to preserve Britain's remaining interests in the Middle East.

    Regarding the Baghdad Pact group, Britain is striving to maintain its leadership, attempting to compete with the United States on an equal footing in order to protect Britain's oil interests along the Persian Gulf. At the recent Karachi meeting of the Baghdad Pact organization, the contradictions between the United States and Britain were particularly prominent. At the meeting, Britain did not hesitate to cut its own flesh, expressing its willingness to provide £2 million in "aid" to the member states of the treaty, and proposed the Baghdad Free Trade Zone and Customs Union plan, attempting to lead the group economically. Britain expressed particular "concern" about the "development" of Iraq. At the same time, Britain also expressed a strong interest in leading this aggressive group militarily. However, Britain's plans did not come to fruition, and under the manipulation of the United States, the British plan was met with a cold reception by the Baghdad Pact group.

    The focus of the U.S.-British struggle in the Middle East was, and still is, rich oil resources. The idea that Britain alone dominates the oil treasures of the Persian Gulf protectorates has not wavered in the slightest to this day. The recently published British Defense White Paper also affirmed that these areas are Britain's "special responsibility" and refused to let the United States share the benefits. However, it is foreseeable that the United States will continue to squeeze out British oil monopoly capital and compete for oil fields in the Persian Gulf on the basis of the positions it has already gained. This determines that the open strife and covert struggles between the United States and Britain will only become more intense, and it is impossible to ease them.

    The Decisive Factor—the People of the Middle East

    Although the Middle East situation is full of complexities, the decisive factor is always the people of the Middle East. Egypt and Syria, the two nationalist fortresses, stand on the Mediterranean coast, encouraging the anti-imperialist struggle of the broad masses of the Middle East. Although the road of anti-colonialist struggle of Egypt, Syria, and the broad masses of the Middle East is tortuous and arduous, they are by no means isolated. They can count on the sympathy and support of socialist countries and friendly countries in Asia, and they can count on the sympathy and support of peace-loving and just people all over the world.

    In the past two months, the U.S. ruling group has been gleefully boasting about its "victory" in the Middle East colonial cause. However, even the U.S. "Newsweek" has seen that in the Middle East, nationalism is "anti-American explosive fuel," and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" currently only has the support of "some political leaders" in the Middle East, while the broad masses of the Middle East still have "extremely bad feelings" towards the United States. As Professor Barraclough of International Affairs at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Britain recently pointed out in an article titled "The Sixth Fleet Sails East" published in the U.S. "Nation" magazine, if Dulles thinks that he has achieved "a series of beautiful achievements" in Jordan and is so proud of himself that he insists on continuing his "system," then Dulles will eventually find that his "system" "will eventually be overturned by the logic of events." Barraclough saw clearly the fact that Dulles may be able to put Middle Eastern nationalism in a bottle and seal it for a few years, but this bottle will eventually "explode."

### 当前中东形势
顾思

    当前中东形势
    顾思
    当前中东形势的特点是，美帝国主义在取代英国在中东的地位以后，积极扩张侵略势力，打击和孤立坚持反殖民主义政策的埃及和叙利亚，分化阿拉伯国家，以便顺利推行“艾森豪威尔主义”。美国这种侵略活动，阻挠了中东局势的缓和，形成一波未平、一波又起的局面。美国策划的约旦事件刚刚告一段落，以色列和叙利亚之间现在又呈现紧张。中东和平再度受到了严重的威胁。
    斗争的焦点——叙利亚
    最近以色列对叙利亚边境的武装挑衅，绝不是偶然的事件。这是美国展开它的颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋的一个信号。
    美国一直把埃及和叙利亚的民族主义的政府，看成是它统治中东的主要障碍，要把它们去之而后快。美国的第一步是孤立叙利亚和埃及。约旦事件就是为了达到这个目的。在约旦事件以后，叙利亚四面就都是或者属于巴格达集团的国家，或者是亲美势力执政的国家。美国认为这种形势是有利于颠覆叙利亚的现政府的。这就是美国现在要走的第二步。这一步如果得逞，埃及就将陷于孤立，美国就可以转而对付埃及了。早在约旦事件发生以后，美国报刊就公开地说，约旦事件是“艾森豪威尔主义”的“第一步”，而“下一个危机”就要轮到叙利亚了。
    美国在苏伊士危机结束以后，就一直同其他帝国主义国家勾结在一起，对叙利亚施加各种压力。在经济方面，今年由于雨水充足，叙利亚的小麦丰收，估计需要出口的小麦将达三十万到四十万吨。大麦产量也远超过往年。但是，一方面，世界市场的麦价在美麦倾销的冲击下，跌落很多；另一方面美国又恶毒地夺取了叙利亚小麦的传统市场，以低价和十分优惠的条件向意大利出售了数十万吨小麦。这就给叙利亚的经济造成了严重的困难。法国一向是叙利亚的棉花的主要买主，现在法国停止了购买。帝国主义的目的，是要用制造叙利亚的经济困难，来煽动叙利亚的地主和资产阶级对现政府的不满。
    约旦事件和叙利亚的经济困难，使得叙利亚国内的亲西方势力受到了鼓励，跃跃欲试。但是由于叙利亚爱国力量的强大，使亲西方势力的几次蠢动都遭到了失败。在这种情况下，美国企图利用以色列同阿拉伯国家之间的矛盾，来达到颠复叙利亚的目的。
    从已经透露的情况看来，美国的阴谋活动是从两方面进行的：一方面以亲美的法西斯政党——叙利亚国家社会党及其它右翼势力为核心，组织政变，同时向叙利亚境内偷运武器，在叙利亚西北部、南部山区及中部沙漠地区煽动暴乱；另一方面，美国指使以色列在叙利亚边境进行挑衅，牵制叙利亚的军队，以外力影响国内政变。如果这样有困难的话，以色列将入侵叙利亚，而亲美的黎巴嫩、约旦等将以支援叙利亚为借口，把它们的军队开进叙利亚，来影响叙利亚的政治局势。
    美国的这个阴谋得到了法国的支持。有消息说，法国军队已经集中在以色列境内靠近叙利亚边界的地方。法国曾经在叙利亚实行过殖民统治，它对于趁此机会同美国在中东分一杯羹是有兴趣的。它也十分愿意通过颠覆叙利亚来孤立埃及，使得它对阿尔及利亚人民的镇压可以更方便些。
    由于美国的这个阴谋，目前中东的局势又趋向紧张。但是叙利亚人民是有决心抵抗侵略的。叙利亚政府已经警告以色列和帝国主义者，如果它们敢于轻举妄动，叙利亚将要予以全力的回击。现在叙利亚的军队已经在边境严阵以待，准备反击来自任何方面的进攻。叙利亚政府的这种坚决的态度，得到了各国爱好和平的人民的支持。这当然将使以色列和帝国主义者们不能不考虑到苏伊士战争的严重教训。
    美国企图巩固自己在中东的地位
    美国之所以这样积极地想颠覆叙利亚，是为了要进一步巩固百慕大会议以来它在中东取得的地位。在今年3月间的英美百慕大会议以后，美国就乘热打铁，向中东进行了大扩张。美国不仅在中东的南线拉拢了黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯，策划了约旦事件，使约旦倒向美国，并且在中东北线，通过加入巴格达条约的军事委员会，拨给条约国家一千二百五十万美元的“援助”，把巴格达条约成员国置于美国的掌握之下。美国还乘此机会，积极扩大它在中东的军事基地。在约旦，英国皇家空军刚刚撤离靠近叙利亚边境的麦法拉克空军基地，美国就立即取而代之，取得了对这个基地的控制权。在黎巴嫩，也有消息说，使美国获得陆海军基地的秘密谈判早在进行中，而事实上，第六舰队最近在干涉中东事务的活动中，已经把贝鲁特当作了它的基地。
    与此同时，美国加紧控制已经落进美国圈套的国家，巩固自己的已得阵地。在约旦事件以后，美国便竭力怂恿约旦宫廷继续镇压爱国力量。美国驻安曼大使甚至向约旦现政府提交逮捕爱国人士的黑名单，并策划把居住在约旦境内的具有强烈反帝情绪的数十万巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民迁移到伊拉克去，以扫除约旦完全投入美国怀抱的障碍。最近美国还决定提供两千万美元的经济和军事“援助”，支持约旦宫廷。在黎巴嫩，美国把大批军事物资运到贝鲁特，以加强黎巴嫩的亲美势力。6月初，美国又通过巴格达条约理事会的卡拉奇会议，进一步控制了这个侵略组织，使它服务于“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且还积极地企图拼凑包括伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、约旦和黎巴嫩的所谓东阿拉伯的反共集团。同时，有许多消息透露，美国正在使某些亲西方的阿拉伯国家同以色列达成暗中和解，打破阿拉伯国家在巴勒斯坦问题上的共同政策。在美国看来，如果颠覆叙利亚的阴谋能够实现，整个西亚地区就成为美国的囊中之物了。
    美英之间的明争暗斗
    美国在中东的扩张，不但遭到了中东人民的反对，而且加剧了帝国主义内部、主要是美、英之间的矛盾。英国统治集团内部的若干有势力的派系，已经为此而流露了深刻的反美情绪。有势力的丘吉尔—索耳兹伯里集团对于美国在中东的作为表现了强烈的不满，就是证明。
    英国为了挽回侵埃战争失败的影响，保障它在中东的石油、贸易、航运和基地利益，已经开始采取了一些以退为进的措施，企图重整巴格达条约组织和缓和阿拉伯世界的反英情绪，以抗衡美国势力在中东的扩张。
    英国政府在面对现实而宣布了使用苏伊士运河以后，又派出代表在罗马同埃及代表举行旨在恢复英埃经济关系的初步谈判。英国显然打算利用美国和阿拉伯民族主义的矛盾的日益扩大，逐渐恢复英国和埃及、叙利亚的正常关系，以保存英国在中东的残余利益。
    对于巴格达条约集团，英国力求保持它的领导权，企图与美国分庭抗礼，以维护英国在波斯湾沿岸的石油权益。在巴格达条约组织的最近一次卡拉奇会议上，美英矛盾表现得异常突出。英国在会议上不惜忍痛挖肉，表示愿意对条约成员国提供两百万英镑的“援助”，并提出巴格达自由贸易区和关税同盟计划，企图从经济上领导这个集团。英国对“开发”伊拉克表示特别“关心”。同时，英国还对从军事上领导这个侵略集团，表示了浓厚的兴趣。但是，英国的这些计划并没有如愿以偿，在美国的操纵下，英国计划遭到了巴格达条约集团的冷遇。
    美英在中东争夺的焦点，过去是，现在仍然是富饶的石油资源。英国独霸波斯湾各保护国的石油宝藏的想法，直到现在并没有丝毫动摇。不久前发表的英国国防白皮书，还肯定这些地区是英国“特有的责任”，而不肯让美国分享利益。但是，可以预见，美国势将在已经取得的阵地的基础上，继续排挤英国的石油垄断资本，争夺波斯湾的油田。这就决定了美英之间的明争暗斗只会越来越剧烈，而不可能得到缓和。
    决定性的因素——中东人民
    中东形势虽然千头万绪，错综复杂，但是决定性的因素始终是中东的人民。埃及和叙利亚这两个民族主义的堡垒屹立在地中海滨，鼓舞着中东广大人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗志。埃及、叙利亚和中东广大人民的反殖民主义斗争的道路虽然是曲折而艰巨的，但是他们绝不是孤立的。他们能够指望社会主义国家和亚洲友好国家的同情和支援，能够指望全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的同情和支持。
    近两个月来，美国统治集团兴高采烈地夸耀它在中东殖民事业的“胜利”。但是，就连美国“新闻周刊”也看到，在中东，民族主义是“反美的爆炸性的燃料”，“艾森豪威尔主义”目前仅仅得到了中东“若干政治领袖”的支持，而广大的中东人民对于美国仍然有着“极坏的情绪”。正如英国皇家国际问题研究所国际问题教授巴拉克拉夫最近在美国“民族周刊”发表的一篇题为“第六舰队东驶”的文章中指出的，如果杜勒斯以为他在约旦得到了“一系列漂亮的成就”，因而得意忘形地硬要继续搞他的“体系”的话，那末，杜勒斯终会发现，他的“体系”“到头来要被事态发展的逻辑推翻”。巴拉克拉夫看清了这样一个事实：杜勒斯也许可以把中东民族主义装在瓶子里封上几年，但是这个瓶子终究是要“发生爆炸”的。
