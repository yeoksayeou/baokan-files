    Different Standpoints, Different Views
    (Our Report) Harbin Daily published an editorial on July 21st entitled "Different Standpoints, Different Views." The editorial stated: "Since the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, a harmful view has been circulating, saying that Rightists are not anti-Communist, anti-people, or anti-socialist, but rather their political and ideological level is too low, they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, so they said the wrong things."
    This statement provides cover for the Rightists. Many Rightist elements no longer claim to be superior; they would rather admit their level is low, willingly concede on this point, and are quite happy to organize a retreat under the cover of "low level."
    Is the problem really a matter of low level? Speaking of level, the Rightists' level of anti-Communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism is not too low. The problem lies in their standpoint. Different standpoints lead to different feelings towards things, and different opinions.
    For example, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign rooted out tens of thousands of counter-revolutionaries, clarified many people's histories, and enabled millions to be tempered and elevated in the struggle. For those who stand on the socialist standpoint, without necessarily having a high level, they will say it was good. However, those who stand on the anti-Communist and anti-socialist standpoint insist on saying it was bad. Is this a problem of level?
    Furthermore, agricultural collectivization permanently eliminated the possibility of a tiny minority of peasants rising to become exploiters and the vast majority of peasants declining to become exploited; it opened up a broad path for peasants to become increasingly prosperous. For those who stand on the people's standpoint, without necessarily having a high level, they will say it was good. Although they also criticize shortcomings in the work, they know that "the first three kicks are hard" and criticize shortcomings in order to correct them. However, those who stand on the bourgeois Rightist standpoint insist on saying it was bad. Is this a problem of level?
    The editorial concludes: "Therefore, the current anti-Rightist struggle is by no means a matter of 'each party has its own reasons,' but a struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. In the current anti-Rightist struggle, one must either uphold the standpoint of supporting the Communist Party, supporting the people's interests, and supporting socialism, or the standpoint of opposing the Communist Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism; the two are mutually exclusive, it is one or the other. If there are still people who think 'everything sounds reasonable,' then they have not resolved their own standpoint problem, and that is truly dangerous."

### 立场不同，看法也不同

    立场不同，看法也不同
    本报讯　7月21日，黑龙江日报以“立场不同，对问题的看法也不同”为题，发表了一篇社论，社论说：自从反右派斗争开始以来，一种有害的看法在流行，说右派分子不是什么反共、反人民、反社会主义，而是政治思想水平太低了，分不清是非，所以说了错话。
    这种说法，给右派打了掩护。很多右派分子已经不再自充高明，他们宁可承认水平低，宁愿在这方面服输，十分愿意在“水平低”的掩护下组织退却。
    问题真是在于水平低吗？若论水平，右派反共、反人民、反社会主义的水平还不算太低。问题在于立场。立场不同，对待事物的感情也不同，见解也不一样。
    例如，肃反斗争，搞出了几万个反革命，另外搞清楚了许多人的历史，还使千百万人在斗争当中得到锻炼和提高，这对于站在社会主义立场的人来说，不一定要有太高的水平，都会说好。但是，站在反共、反社会主义立场的人却硬说这不好。这是水平问题吗？
  又如，农业合作化，永远消灭了极少数农民上升为剥削者，绝大多数农民下降为剥削者的可能；给农民开辟了日益走向富裕的广阔道路。这对于站在人民立场的人来说，不一定要有太高的水平，都会说好。虽然他们也批评工作的缺点，但是他们知道这是“头三脚难踢”，批评缺点是为了改正。可是，站在资产阶级右派立场的人却硬说这不好。这是水平问题吗？
    社论最后说：所以，当前的反右派斗争，绝不是什么“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”的问题，而是资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争。在当前的反右派斗争中，或者是拥护共产党、拥护人民利益、拥护社会主义的立场，或者是反共、反人民、反社会主义的立场，二者不可兼得，非此即彼。如果还有人认为“听过去都有理”，那就是没解决自己的立场问题，那真是太危险了。
