Shanghai Dispatch from our Newspaper: Chen Mingshu, an important figure among the rightists, was organizing a conspiracy clique in Shanghai, attempting to usurp the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) Shanghai Municipal Committee. His attempt to revive the "Shenguang Publishing House" has been exposed at the RCCK Shanghai Municipal Committee enlarged meeting on the 24th. According to materials revealed by Zhang Baoyu, an alternate member of the RCCK Shanghai Municipal Committee, Chen Mingshu, during the period of Great Blooming and Great Contending, brought his personal secretary to Shanghai, scouring everywhere for "old comrades," seeking "talent," and organizing an anti-Party, anti-socialist small clique. The main members of this small clique included Luo Haisha, Yu Ruonan, Liu Haiting, Zhao Jishun, as well as Wu Yiwu, Lu Jinggu and others. During his stay in Shanghai, Chen Mingshu met with Luo Haisha, Yu Ruonan, and others at the Shanghai Mansion eight times to discuss the leadership of the RCCK Shanghai Municipal Committee. They lined up the responsible persons of the RCCK Municipal Committee one by one, specifically analyzing who could be utilized, who should be attacked, and deliberated repeatedly. After the candidates were determined, Chen Mingshu recommended Zhao Jishun, a "good friend" of Yu Ruonan, to Zhao Zukang, Deputy Director of the RCCK Municipal Committee, praising Zhao as a "talent." When contacting lower-level members of the RCCK, he instructed, "Haisha is your responsible person; you can consult him more on problems," making every effort to establish the leadership prestige of core figures headed by Luo Haisha among RCCK members, in preparation for further seizing the leadership of the RCCK Municipal Committee.

    At the same time, Chen Mingshu also tried his best to win over the "old comrades" of the former Shenzhou Guoguang Publishing House, attempting to control the publishing front and carry out anti-Party conspiracy activities. He incited Yu Balin, saying, "The publishing work is a mess now, full of errors. The 'Materials on Modern Chinese History' published by the New Knowledge Publishing House is not as good as what you did." He also told Yu, "I plan to revive 'Shenzhou,' with me as the president, Yu Ruonan as the vice president, and the rest of the staff being the original personnel, restoring the original salaries." Regarding the funding issue, he also said, "I have people in Hong Kong who can find a way; the problem can be solved in three months." At this time, Chen also instructed Su Yili to go to the New Knowledge Publishing House to instigate "independence," even asking the employees to find the standard font of the past "Shenzhou" in preparation for a "auspicious opening."

    到处搜罗“旧部”物色“人才”
    陈铭枢在上海组织阴谋小集团
    本报上海讯　右派重要头目陈铭枢在上海组织阴谋小集团，企图篡夺民革市委领导权；企图恢复“神光出版社”的活动，已在24日民革市委扩大会上被揭发出来。据民革市委候补委员张胞与揭发的材料，陈铭枢在大放大鸣期间，带着私人秘书到上海，到处搜罗“旧部”，物色“人才”，组织反党、反社会主义小集团，这个小集团的主要成员有罗海沙、余若南、刘海亭、赵继舜，还有吴艺五、陆晶沽等人。陈铭枢住上海期间，曾先后八次与罗海沙、余若南等在上海大厦研究民革上海市委的领导权问题。他们将民革市委负责人一一排队，具体分析某人可以利用，某人应该打击，斟酌再三。人选确定后，陈铭枢便向民革市委副主任委员赵祖康荐举余若南的“好友”赵继舜，夸奖赵是一个“人才”。他在接触民革下层人员时，又指示说：“海沙是你们的负责人，有问题可以多向他请教”，千方百计地在民革成员中树立以罗海沙为首的核心分子的领导威信，为进一步夺取民革市委的领导作准备。
    与此同时，陈铭枢又竭力拉拢前神州国光社的“旧部”，企图掌握出版阵地，进行反党阴谋活动。他煽惑俞巴林说：“现在出版工作一团糟，错误百出，新知识出版社出版的‘中国近代史资料’还没有你做的好。”他又对俞表示：“我打算把‘神州’恢复起来，由我任社长，余若南任副社长，其他都是原班人马，恢复原工资。”对资金问题，他还说：“我香港有人，可以想办法，三个月就可以解决问题。这时，陈又指示苏一立到新知识出版社去策动“独立”，甚至要职工把过去“神州”的标准字体找出来，准备“择吉开张”。
