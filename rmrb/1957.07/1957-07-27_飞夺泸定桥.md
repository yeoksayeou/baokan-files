    Seizing the Luding Bridge
    General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu
    A Glorious Task
    In May 1935, the Red Army on the Long March reached the Dadu River on the border of Sichuan and Kangding. The First Regiment victoriously completed the forced crossing at Anshunchang on the 22nd, but because the water flow was too rapid, a bridge could not be built. The crossing only had three small boats, and each round trip took several tens of minutes. If tens of thousands of troops relied solely on these three small boats to cross the river, it would take an unknown amount of time. The counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek was ordering Liu Wenhui and Yang Sen's troops to firmly block the Dadu River and ordering Xue Yue and Zhou Hunyuan's troops to relentlessly pursue from the rear. This was because the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's famous general Shi Dakai was finally eliminated by Qing troops at Anshunchang. Chiang Kai-shek also dreamed of treating the Red Army as a second Shi Dakai. At that time, people across the country were worriedly wondering: Would the Red Army follow Shi Dakai's path? Would the tragedy of history repeat itself?
    In order to quickly cross the Dadu River and smash the counter-revolutionary plot of encirclement and suppression from both the front and rear, it was necessary to seize the Luding Bridge with all possible speed. Our vanguard Red Fourth Regiment of the Left Route Army, under these circumstances, accepted the order from Commander Lin Biao of the Army Corps – to resolutely and swiftly seize the Luding Bridge. The First Division, commanded by Chief of the General Staff Liu Bocheng of the Military Commission and Political Commissar Nie Rongzhen of the First Army Corps, continued to cross the river at Anshunchang and advanced north along the east bank of the Dadu River to coordinate with our Second Division's Fourth Regiment in seizing the Luding Bridge.
    The First Day of Victory
    On the morning of the 23rd, our regiment set out from Anshunchang, heading towards Luding Bridge along the west bank of the Dadu River. The entire journey was 320 *li*, and the order stipulated that it had to be reached in three days. The road was a winding, undulating, single-track path, with towering cliffs like knife cuts on the left, reaching into the clouds. On the mountainside was snow that never melted, dazzling with silver light and filled with biting cold; on the right was a deep river several *zhang* deep, with turbulent waves. A moment's carelessness could lead to the danger of "a single slip becoming an eternal regret." But everyone did not take this danger to heart. At the time, there was only one thought: speed up the advance and take the Luding Bridge.
    After traveling about 30 *li*, the enemy forces deployed across the river began firing at us. To avoid unnecessary casualties, we had to take a detour to climb the mountain, circling around for more than 10 *li*, which took up a lot of time.
    After traveling 60 *li*, a large mountain loomed ahead. The advance company suddenly encountered an enemy company. The brave warriors were like fierce tigers seeing a flock of sheep, and with a single charge, they routed the enemy. This mountain was more than 10 *li* high. At the foot of the mountain was a small river, and the bridge had been destroyed by the enemy. Although the river was not wide, it was very deep, and wading across was impossible. Battalion Commander Ji Guangshun immediately organized the troops to cut down trees and build a bridge.
    After winning the battle, we ran even faster. There were still scattered gunshots ahead. Suddenly, a scout ran back to report: "In the left front of our advancing route, there is a large mountain depression, and we have discovered that about a battalion of enemies are guarding it, blocking our path." I and Regiment Commander Wang Kaixiang led the cadres to run forward to scout the terrain. We saw that this mountain was like a cliff, with only a small path in the middle, as steep as a ladder to the sky. Looking up, even our hats would fall off. On the top of the mountain and at the pass, fortifications had been built. On the right was the river, with no way to go around. It seemed that it was impossible to charge up from the front or the right. The left was also a sheer cliff, with sparse small trees and thorns growing on the cliff face. The top of the cliff connected to higher mountain peaks. After careful reconnaissance, we determined that climbing the left cliff would allow us to slip into the enemy's flank and attack the pass from the enemy's rear. We immediately ordered Third Battalion Commander Zeng Qinglin and General Branch Secretary Luo Huasheng to lead a company to resolutely climb up from the left, and organized the Third Battalion to feign a strong attack from the front. The enemy arrogantly fired machine guns, sealing off the road so that not even a bee could fly through. In less than an hour, we heard gunfire behind the enemy. The Third Battalion took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack, and the enemy was defeated. Then, with a fierce pursuit, the enemy's three companies were completely wiped out at the foot of the mountain, capturing the battalion and company commanders and more than 200 prisoners.
    240 *Li* in One Day
    The next day, we received another order, which read: "Wang, Yang: The Military Commission telegraphed, ordering the Left Route Army to seize the Luding Bridge by the 25th. You must use the fastest marching speed and decisive tactics to complete this glorious and great task. In this battle, you must break the past records of seizing Daozhou and the Fifth Regiment seizing Yaxi, traveling 160 *li* in one day. You are heroes on the front line and models in the Red Army. We believe you will definitely complete this task. We are preparing to celebrate your victory." Behind it was the vigorous signature of Commander Lin Biao. After reading the order, the regiment commander and I stared at each other for a while and said in unison, "This is both a glorious and extremely arduous task!"
    "The 25th"! The 25th is tomorrow! From here to Luding Bridge is still 240 *li*. We have to walk two days' worth of road in one day. No one expected that the task would become so sudden and so urgent! 240 *li* is a big problem! The road has to be walked, not a single step less! And we still have to break through the enemy's heavy blockades.
    But this is an order, this is a glorious task, and it must be resolutely carried out without allowing a minute or a second of hesitation. Everything now is a matter of time. Originally, there were two regiments of enemies defending the Luding Bridge, and now we have personally seen two brigades of enemies reinforcing the Luding Bridge. They used a portion of their forces to prevent our Red First Division from advancing, and the majority went north along the east bank of the river, advancing alongside us. If we arrive at Luding Bridge earlier than the enemy, there is hope for victory, otherwise, it will be very difficult, or even impossible, for the Red Army to pass through Luding Bridge. The troops cannot stop, and time is extremely precious. We summoned battalion and regiment cadres and the headquarters political department cadres while marching to jointly study how to complete this urgent task. The mobilization slogans we put forward were: "The Red Fourth Regiment has a glorious combat history, resolutely complete this glorious task, and maintain the glorious tradition!"; "Learn from the Red First Regiment in seizing Anshunchang, compete with the Red First Regiment, and resolutely take the Luding Bridge!"; "The task is glorious and extremely arduous, we must withstand the test!". We required the troops to arrive at Luding Bridge before 6:00 AM tomorrow. After the meeting, we went to the companies to carry out mobilization work separately.
    The mobilization work for the urgent task had just been completed, and the troops were approaching Meng Hu Gang (Fierce Tiger Ridge).
    Meng Hu Gang is a dangerous high mountain, with 30-40 *li* uphill and 30-40 *li* downhill, bordering the Dadu River on the right and higher mountains on the left, with only a narrow path in the middle. People say it is the throat from Anshunchang to Luding Bridge, and it is indeed not an exaggeration. A battalion of enemies was guarding the pass at the top of the mountain. At this time, it was foggy, and nothing could be seen beyond five steps. The enemy realized that we were advancing towards the peak of Meng Hu Gang, but the fog was vast, and they could not see where we were. They were just panicking and blindly firing their guns in our direction from inside their fortifications. We took advantage of the natural conditions of the fog to organize the troops to feel their way up the mountain and ordered everyone not to fire a single shot. After approaching the enemy, we used bayonets and grenades to eliminate them. Before long, we heard a series of "boom, boom..." grenade explosions and shouts of killing. The frightened enemy had no choice but to flee backwards. Our advance battalion immediately pursued the fleeing enemy all the way to the foot of the mountain. Using the captured prisoners, we picked up a lot of spoils of victory along the way - bullets and white flour! When the pursuing troops approached Moxi Mian village, they encountered an enemy battalion and a regimental headquarters stationed in the village. Under the impact of our victorious spearhead, we defeated the enemy again, and we occupied Moxi Mian. The hateful enemy destroyed the bridge over the river east of the village, which added new difficulties to our actions and delayed us for two hours before we built the bridge and continued to advance, covering another 40-50 *li* in one go. When we arrived at a village of about a dozen families on the bank of the Dadu River, it was already 7:00 PM. From here to Luding Bridge, there were still 110 *li*.
    Difficulties came one after another. The weather turned against us, and suddenly there was a torrential downpour, lightning and thunder, and the sky was terrifyingly dark. The troops had not eaten all day, and their stomachs were so hungry that it was difficult to hold on. Marching in the dark, the muddy road was slippery, and the livestock and luggage could not keep up. When descending Meng Hu Gang, we clearly saw that the enemy on the opposite bank was still advancing alongside us. If the enemy reached Luding Bridge before us, everything would be over. All of these difficulties needed to be solved immediately.
    The more serious the difficulties, the more necessary it was to strengthen political work. We issued a call to the Party branch, to all Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists, explaining all the difficulties facing us, but emphasizing the need to strive to reach Luding Bridge before 6:00 AM tomorrow. We ordered everyone to prepare a crutch, to walk with the help of a crutch if they could not walk without it, and to crawl even if they could not use a crutch. Even if we had to crawl, we had to get there on time. There was no time to cook, so we asked everyone to chew raw rice and drink cold water to satisfy their hunger. This call, like a fire, ignited the troops' fervent fighting spirit. It seemed that even if there were mountains of knives ahead, they could step over them. However, in this dark night where you could not see your own hand, how could we walk the muddy and slippery 110 *li*? This question weighed on my mind like a thousand-pound stone.
    Suddenly, a few lights appeared on the mountain depression on the opposite bank, instantly turning into a long string of torches. The enemy was lighting torches to march. The enemy's torches gave us inspiration. "Let's light torches too," I thought, and immediately went to discuss it with the regiment commander, chief of staff, and general branch secretary. But then I changed my mind: "The enemy and I are only separated by a river. If the enemy contacts us and exposes our faces, and starts fighting with us, what should we do?!"
    "When things are difficult, you must be bold." We decided to disguise ourselves using the numbers of the three battalions of enemies we had eliminated and defeated in the past two days to deceive the enemy. We immediately ordered the troops to buy all the fences from the villagers, and everyone tied a torch, lighting one per squad when marching, not allowing any waste, and striving to walk more than 10 *li* per hour. We also arranged for the bugler to use the captured enemy's internal communication signals to prepare to contact the enemy if necessary. Liu Wenhui's troops were all from Sichuan, so we also selected comrades from Sichuan and newly arrived prisoners to be ready to answer the enemy's questions in the Sichuan dialect if necessary. To speed up the march, all livestock, luggage, and heavy weapons, including the regiment commander's and my own horses, were left behind, protected by a platoon led by the administrative director He Jingzhi and adjutant Deng Guanghan, who would follow behind.
    At that time, the wound on my leg had not fully healed, and it was still a bit inconvenient to walk. Comrades, especially the regiment commander, advised me to ride a horse. This was the time when cadres needed to set an example, so how could I ride a horse? I said to everyone in a challenging tone: "Comrades, let's walk together! Let's see who walks faster! Who gets to Luding Bridge first!" The troops marched forward with great joy, holding their torches high.
    The torches of the enemy and us on both banks turned the river water of the Dadu River red, looking like two dancing fire dragons from a distance. Through the sound of the waves of the Dadu River, we heard the crisp bugle sound and the faint shouts of "What kind of troops are you?!" from the opposite bank. The enemy was contacting us. Our bugler blew the bright bugle sound according to the prescribed bugle call, and the Sichuan comrades and "prisoners" raised their voices and answered loudly. The stupid enemy could not have imagined that the heroic Red Army, which they had dreamed of eliminating day and night, was walking alongside them, and they walked with us for 20-30 *li* in confusion. Later, it rained even harder. By midnight, the fire dragon on the opposite bank disappeared. At that time, we estimated that they were probably afraid of hardship and stopped walking. Seeing that the enemy had camped, we were extremely happy. This situation was immediately spread throughout the regiment. The comrades discussed one after another: seize the good opportunity! Walk fast, walk fast! One after another, they desperately hurried forward.
    The rain poured down on the soldiers, and mountain floods rushed straight from the peaks to the Dadu River. The already difficult narrow path was now washed by rainwater and looked like it was coated with a layer of oil, making it so slippery that the crutches were useless. If you were not careful, you would fall headfirst. It could be said that you would stumble every three steps and fall every five steps. The team was practically rolling forward. Even in such circumstances, people were still constantly dozing off. Some people would just stop walking, and the people behind them would push them: "Walk! The people in front are far away!" Only then would they wake up in a daze and hurry to catch up. Later, everyone simply untied their leggings and tied them together one by one, pulling each other forward. After a whole night of forced march, we triumphantly reached Luding Bridge at around 6:00 AM the next morning, occupying the west bank and the west bridgehead. On this day, in addition to fighting and building bridges, we also rushed 240 *li*, which was really fast!
    We Want the Bridge, Not the Guns
    We occupied several buildings west of the bridge and an Italian Catholic church. The soldiers were busy drying their clothes, cooking, and resting. Regiment Commander Wang and I led battalion and company cadres to inspect the terrain.
    Luding Bridge was truly a dangerous place. Even we heroes who opened roads through mountains, built bridges over water, and seized passes, could not help but take a breath of cold air. Looking down, the red flowing water poured down from the mountain gorges upstream like a waterfall, impacting the jagged, towering rocks at the bottom of the river, splashing white waves more than a *zhang* high. In such a river, even a small fish would not want to stay for a moment. Wading and ferries were completely impossible. The only way was to walk from the bridge.
    Looking at the bridge again, it was neither a stone bridge nor a wooden bridge, but an iron chain bridge. Thirteen long iron chains, each ring linked to the next, were stretched from the east bank to the west bank, each as thick as an ordinary rice bowl. Two on each side served as bridge railings, and nine side by side underneath formed the bridge surface. Originally, the bridge surface was covered with wooden planks, looking like an ordinary bridge. When people walked on it, the bridge surface would sway and swing with people's movement, like a cradle. Now, the wooden planks had been moved into the city by the enemy, leaving only the dark iron chains hanging in the air. On a stone tablet at the bridgehead were engraved two lines of poetry: "Ten thousand mountains beside Luding Bridge, high peaks reaching into the clouds for a thousand *li*."
    The east end of Luding Bridge was Luding City. This city was half-hanging on the east mountain and half-sticking to the bank of the Dadu River. The city wall was more than two *zhang* high, and the west gate blocked the bridgehead. To pass the bridge, one had to pass through the city gate. There was no other way. Two regiments of enemies were stationed in the city, and they had meticulously deployed their positions on the hillside. Machine guns were concentrated near the bridgehead, constantly strafing us, and mortars were bombing like a string of beads. Relying on such a natural barrier, the enemy arrogantly shouted loudly at us: "Fly over here! We surrender our guns!" Our soldiers loudly replied: "We don't want your guns, we just want your bridge."
    After inspecting the terrain, we immediately organized a battalion of firepower, including machine guns, to block the enemy's reinforcements along the east bank of the river. Because, like the west bank, the east bank also had only a small path relying on the mountains and water. The enemy could only reach Luding Bridge from that road.
    Immediately afterwards, we went to the companies to carry out combat mobilization for seizing the bridge. The troops launched a surge of enthusiasm to strive to be the shock brigade for seizing the bridge. The companies all submitted lists of shock brigades, requesting approval for them to undertake the shock mission.
    At noon, we held a regiment-wide cadre meeting at the Italian Catholic Church to study and approve the shock brigade. As soon as the meeting started, a row of mortar shells bombed over from the opposite bank, and a large hole was blown open in the roof of the Catholic Church. Shrapnel and tiles poured down. But everyone did not move. Countless pairs of eyes glared angrily at the east bank. I took the opportunity to encourage: "The enemy is here to mobilize us! We must immediately fight across the bridge. Now everyone say which company should be allowed to be the shock brigade." As soon as I finished speaking, Liao Dazhu, the normally quiet second company commander, stood up with a brush. His short and sturdy body trembled a little excitedly, and his dark face suddenly turned red to his ears. He said with difficulty:
    "The First Company made contributions in crossing the Wujiang River and became a model company for crossing the Wujiang River. We must learn from the First Company and strive to be the heroic company for seizing the Luding Bridge."
    "The shock brigade for seizing the bridge must be our Third Company," Wang Youcai, the quick-tempered third company commander, started talking like a machine gun before Liao Dazhu finished speaking: "Our Third Company has never fallen behind in any battle. This time, we guarantee to take down the bridge." He stood there like a small iron tower. Finally, he said like complaining: "If we are not called the shock brigade, I, this company commander, will not be able to explain to the soldiers." Afterwards, there was a fierce debate. It seemed that no one wanted to give this task to others, and we leaders had to designate it. After Regiment Commander Wang and I studied it, Regiment Commander Wang explained the task of seizing the bridge to the cadres and designated the Second Company as the shock brigade. Then I stood up to add to everyone: "There are plenty of battles to fight. Let's take turns. The First Company took the lead in crossing the Wujiang River last time. This time it's the Second Company's turn. The twenty-two Communist Party members and activists of the Second Company will form the shock brigade, with Comrade Liao Dazhu as the shock brigade leader. I think it's very good. Does everyone have any objections?" A burst of applause rang out in the meeting place, and Liao Dazhu jumped up happily. Only Wang Youcai hung his head, muttering something in his mouth. "The task of the Third Company is not light," I pointed to Wang Youcai and said: "Your company will be the second echelon, following the shock brigade to charge, and you will also be responsible for paving the bridge surface so that the follow-up troops can quickly rush into the city. Do you have any objections?" Only then did Wang Youcai show a smile. Finally, we ordered each company to eat one *jin* of bacon obtained from beating the local tyrants so that the troops could have enough to eat to fight. After the meeting, I told General Branch Secretary Luo Huasheng to go to the Second Company to help with the shock preparation work.
    The general offensive began at 4:00 PM. The regiment commander and I commanded the battle at the bridgehead. All the buglers of the regiment were gathered to blow the charge, and all the weapons fired at the enemy on the opposite bank at the same time. The sound of guns and shouts of killing shook the valley. Twenty-two shock heroes, holding submachine guns or short guns, carrying machetes on their backs, and with twelve grenades wrapped around their waists, led by Company Commander Liao Dazhu, braved the dense bullets, climbed the bridge railings, and stepped on the iron chains towards the opposite bank. Following them were the commanders and fighters of the Third Company, led by Company Commander Wang Youcai. In addition to weapons, each of them carried a wooden plank, charging and paving the bridge at the same time. When the shock brigade just rushed to the opposite bridgehead, a raging fire suddenly broke out at the west city gate. The enemy attempted to block us at the east bridgehead with fire and eliminate us with firepower. The fire illuminated half the sky, and the bridgehead was surrounded by raging fire.
    This was a moment of great importance. The twenty-two heroes seemed to hesitate for a moment when they saw the raging fire at the city gate. The large group of people standing with the regiment commander and me shouted loudly: "Comrades! This is the key to victory! Charge in! Don't be afraid of the fire! Don't hesitate! Charge! The enemy is collapsing!" This shout gave the heroes courage, determination, and strength. In the loud sound of the charge, they rushed into the fire one after another. Company Commander Liao Dazhu's hat caught fire. He threw away his hat and continued to charge forward with his head bare. The heroes' eyebrows and hair were burned. They still followed Company Commander Liao through the smoke and fire all the way into the street, engaging in street fighting with the enemy. The enemy concentrated all their strength to counterattack, and the twenty-two heroes ran out of bullets and grenades. The situation was extremely urgent, and it looked like they could not hold on. At this critical moment, Company Commander Wang Youcai led the Third Company to rush in, and then Regiment Commander Wang and I led the second echelon to quickly cross the bridge and enter the city. After two hours of fierce fighting, most of the two regiments of enemies were wiped out, and the rest collapsed in confusion. At dusk, I completely occupied Luding City and firmly controlled Luding Bridge.
    The current priority was to prevent the enemy's counterattack and ensure the safety of Luding Bridge. We immediately dispatched the Army Corps teaching battalion assigned to our regiment to guard in the direction of Dajianlu because there were still several regiments of Liu Wenhui's troops there. To deal with the two brigades of enemies reinforcing Luding Bridge, we sent a battalion to develop south along the river. At 10:00 PM, the leading platoon started fighting. At that time, we estimated that the enemy's reinforcements had arrived, and we were preparing for another bitter battle. Part of the battalion occupied the position and organized a charge, capturing a wounded soldier. After asking, we found out that he was a comrade from the Third Regiment of our Red First Division. Only then did we know that the First Division had arrived. The tense mood of preparing for a desperate battle immediately relaxed, and the troops were overjoyed. It turned out that the two brigades of enemies were caught up by our Red First Division and fought in the Zhulinping area, 60 *li* south of the city. Later, the enemy was afraid of being attacked by us from both sides and fled in a panic in the direction of Hualinping. We immediately sent people to welcome Chief of the General Staff Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Nie Rongzhen, who were advancing with the Red First Division, into Luding City. Everyone was very happy when they met.
    It was already 2:00 AM, but Chief of Staff Liu Bocheng was still in high spirits and asked me to take him and Political Commissar Nie to see Luding Bridge. I carried a kerosene lamp and accompanied them from the east of the bridge to the west. Chief of Staff Liu Bocheng looked at each iron ring of each iron chain very carefully, as if he wanted to imprint the entire Luding Bridge in his mind. When returning from the west of the bridge to the center of the bridge, he stopped, held onto the bridge railing, looked down at the rapids of the Dadu River, and forcefully stomped three times on the bridge planks, saying with emotion: "Luding Bridge! Luding Bridge! How much effort and how much heart we have spent on you! Now we have won! We have won!"
    From the enemy documents seized, we found an emergency bulletin issued by Liu Wenhui, which read: "Now Zhu and Mao are like the second Shi Dakai, with the Dadu River in front and the Jinsha River behind, like turtles in a jar. Eliminating the Communist bandits is just a matter of time." He also arrogantly offered a reward for capturing our army leaders. After reading this bulletin, Chief of Staff Liu Bocheng said with interest: "The enemy really values us. My value is worth 100,000 silver dollars." The heroes of the Red Army said heroically: "Although we are walking the old road that Shi Dakai walked, we will not fall into the repetition of history, but will open up a bright and victorious road, because the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is the people's armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    On the third day, Commander Lin Biao of the Army Corps arrived with the main force of the Army Corps. He warmly congratulated us on completing the task and gave us great encouragement. Then Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu also came. Thousands of troops crossed the dangerous Dadu River from this heroic Luding Bridge. The twenty-two heroes who first rushed across Luding Bridge were commended by the superiors. With their tenacious and fearless combat actions, they wrote an extremely glorious page in the combat history of our army.

    飞夺泸定桥
    中国人民解放军上将　杨成武
    光荣的任务
    1935年5月，长征的红军进抵川、康交界的大渡河畔。红一团在22日胜利地完成了安顺场的强渡，但因水流太急，不能架桥，渡口只有三只小船，往返一次要数十分钟。数万大军如果只靠这三只小船来渡河，不知要花费多少时日。反革命的蒋介石正在命令刘文辉、杨森部坚堵大渡河，并命令薛岳、周浑元部衔尾猛追。因为太平天国的名将石达开就是在安顺场被清兵最后消灭的。蒋介石也梦想着把红军当作第二个石达开。当时，全国人民都在忧虑地想：红军会不会走石达开的道路？历史的悲剧会不会重演？
    为了迅速渡过大渡河，粉碎反革命前后夹击合围的阴谋，必须火速夺下泸定桥。我们左路军前卫红四团，就是在这个情况下，接受了林彪军团长的命令——坚决迅速夺取泸定桥。红一师由军委总参谋长刘伯承、一军团政委聂荣臻指挥继续于安顺场渡河，沿大渡河东岸北进，策应我二师四团夺取泸定桥。
    胜利的第一天
    23日清晨，我团从安顺场出发，沿大渡河西岸，奔向泸定桥。全程三百二十里，命令规定三天赶到。路，是羊肠曲折、忽起忽伏的单边路，左边是刀劈一样的高山峭壁，向上插入云霄，山腰上是终年不化的积雪，银光耀眼，寒气袭人；右边是深达数丈、波涛汹涌的大河。稍不小心就有“一失足成千古恨”的危险。但大家并没有把这危险放在心上，当时，只有一个想法：加速前进，拿下泸定桥。
    大概走了三十多里光景，隔河对岸布防的敌军开始向我们射击，为了避免无谓伤亡，只得弯路爬山，绕出十多里，这样花费了不少时间。
    走了六十里光景，前面隆起了一座大山。先头连忽然和敌人一个连遭遇，勇士们好像猛虎见了群羊，只一个猛冲，就把敌人打垮了。这山有十多里高，翻过山下是一条小河，桥已被敌人毁掉了。河面虽然不宽，但很深，徒涉是不能过去的。一营营长季光顺立即组织部队砍树架桥。
    打了胜仗，跑路更有劲了。前面还有零星的枪声。突然，侦察员飞奔回来报告：“在我前进路上的左前方有一个大山凹，发现上面约有一个营的敌人把守，堵住了我们的去路”我和团长王开湘同志领着干部跑步前进去侦察地形。只见这座山像是峭壁，中间只有一条小路，陡得像座天梯，抬起头来看，连帽子都要掉下来。山顶和隘口上，筑了碉堡。右边靠河，无路可绕。看样子，正面和右面是无论如何冲不上去的。左面也是凌空直立的悬崖，崖壁上稀落地长着一些小树和荆棘。崖顶连接着更高的山峰。经过仔细侦察后断定：爬上左面的悬崖定可抄入敌人的侧背，从敌人的后面袭取这个隘口。我们立即命令三营长曾庆林和总支书记罗华生同志带一个连坚决从左边爬上去，并组织三营从正面佯作强攻。敌人耀武扬威地打着机枪，把路口封锁得连一个蜜蜂也飞不过去。不到一个钟头就听见敌人后面枪声响了。三营乘势发起猛攻，敌人就这样被打下去了。接着一个猛追，敌人三个连完全被消灭在山崖脚下，活捉营、连长各一，俘虏二百多人。
    一天二百四十里
    第二天，我们又接到一道命令，里面写道：“王、杨：军委来电，限左路军25日夺下泸定桥，你们要以最高速度的行军和机断手段去完成这一光荣伟大的任务。你们在此次战斗中要突破过去夺取道洲和五团夺取鸭溪一天走一百六十里的记录。你们是火线上的英雄，红军中的模范，相信你们一定能完成此一任务。我们准备着庆祝你们的胜利。”后面是军团长林彪同志刚劲有力的签字。看完命令后，我和团长面对面的凝视了一会，不约而同地说：“这是一个又光荣又十分艰巨的任务！”
    “二十五号”！二十五号就是明天！从这里到泸定桥还有二百四十里，两天的路我们必须一天走完。谁也没料想到任务会变得这样突然，这样紧急！二百四十里路就是一个大难题！路，是要人走的，少一步都不行啊！而且还要突破敌人的重重堵击。
    但这是命令，这是光荣的任务，一定要坚决执行，不容许一分钟、一秒钟的迟疑。现在的一切都是时间问题。泸定桥那里，本来有敌人两个团防守，现在又亲眼看见两旅敌人正向泸定桥增援，他们以一部兵力阻止我红一师前进，大部分沿河东岸北上，跟我们齐头前进。如果我们比敌人早到泸定桥，胜利就有希望，不然，红军要想通过泸定桥就很困难了，甚至不可能了。部队不能停留，时间万分宝贵。我们边行军边召集营、团干部和司令部政治处干部共同研究怎样完成这一紧急任务。我们提出的动员口号是：“红四团有光荣的战斗历史，坚决完成这一光荣任务，保持光荣传统！”；“向夺取安顺场的红一团学习，和红一团比赛，坚决拿下泸定桥！”；“任务是光荣的，又是十分艰巨的，我们要经得起考验！”。要求部队在明天六时前赶到泸定桥。会后，分头深入连队进行动员。
    紧急任务的动员工作刚要做完，部队已接近猛虎岗。
    猛虎岗是一座上三、四十里下三、四十里的险恶高山，右傍大渡河，左面是更高的山峰，中间只有一条羊肠小道。人们说它是从安顺场到泸定桥的咽喉，确实一点也不夸张。山顶的隘口上有一个营的敌人扼守。这时，正是大雾迷蒙，五步以外，什么也看不见。敌人发觉我们向猛虎岗山峰前进，但大雾茫茫，看不清我们在那里，只是在工事里恐慌地、盲目地向我们前进方向乱放枪。我们利用大雾的自然条件，组织部队摸上山去，并命令大家不许放一枪，接近敌人后，用刺刀、手榴弹解决敌人。不多时，只听得“轰隆、轰隆……”一连串手榴弹声响，杀声四起。吓破了胆的敌人，只好向后溃逃了。我先头营即向溃敌猛追一直追至山下，利用抓到的俘虏兵在沿途拾了不少的胜利品——子弹呀，白面呀！追击部队接近摩西面村时，又同驻在该村的敌人一个营和一个团部遭遇了，在我胜利矛头的冲击下，又把敌人打垮了，我们又占领了摩西面。可恶的敌人又将村东河上的大桥破坏了，这使我们的行动增加了新的困难，耽误了两小时才架起桥，继续前进，一口气又跑了四、五十里。到得大渡河傍岸一个约有十多家人的村子时，已是傍晚七点了，从这里到泸定桥还有一百一十里。
    困难一个接一个地来了。天不由人，突然大雨倾盆，电闪雷鸣，天黑得可怕，伸手不见五指；部队一天没有吃上饭，肚子饿得难支持；黑夜行军，泥泞路滑，牲口、行李都跟不上；在下猛虎岗的时候，我们已清楚地看见对岸的敌人仍然还和我们并肩前进，如果敌人先我赶到泸定桥，我们一切都算完了。这一切一切的困难都需要马上想办法解决。
    困难越是严重，越须要加强政治工作，我们向党支部，向所有共产党员、青年团员和积极分子发出了号召，说明摆在我们面前的一切困难，但必须争取明天六时前赶到泸定桥，命令每人准备一个拐杖，走不动的扶着拐杖走，不能扶拐杖的也要爬着走，就是爬也要按时爬到；来不及做饭了，要大家嚼生米、喝凉水充饥。这号召，像一把火，点燃起部队炽烈的战斗情绪，看样子，那怕前面尽是刀山，他们都可以踩过去。然而，在这伸手不见掌的黑夜里，怎能走完这泥泞油滑的一百一十里路呢？这一问题像一块千斤重石压在我的心头。
    忽然，对岸山凹上出现了几点火光，刹那间变成了一长串的火炬。是敌人在点着火把赶路。敌人的火把给了我们启示。“我们也点着火把走”，我脑子里闪去这样的想法，立即去同团长参谋长总支书记研究，但又一转念：“敌我仅一河之隔，如果敌人向我们联络，暴露了我们的面目，跟我们干起来，如何是好？！”
    “事到万难须放胆”，我们决定利用今昨两天被我们消灭和打垮的三个营敌人的番号伪装自己，欺骗敌人。立即命令部队将全村老乡家的篱笆全部买下，每人绑一个火把，行军时，一班点一个，不许浪费，争取每小时走十里以上。并布置司号员用缴获的敌人的内部联络信号准备在必要使用它时同敌人联络；刘文辉的部队都是四川人，我们还选出四川籍的同志和刚来的俘虏兵准备必要时用四川口音来回答敌人的问话。为了加快行军速度，把所有牲口、行李、重武器连同团长和我的乘马在内，一律留下，由管理处长何敬之、副官邓光汉带一个排掩护，随后跟进。
    那时，我腿上的伤口还没有全好，走路还有些不大方便，同志们特别是团长都劝我骑着马走。这正是需要干部起模范作用的时候，那能再骑马？我以挑战的口吻向大家说：“同志们，咱们一块走吧！看看谁走的快！谁先走到泸定桥！”部队兴高采烈的高举火把向前挺进。
    两岸敌我的火把，把大渡河的河水映成红色，远望去，像两条飞舞的火龙。透过大渡河的波涛声，从对岸传来了清脆的军号声和微弱的“啥子部队啊！”的喊声，敌人在向我们联络了。我们的司号员按规定的号音吹起了嘹亮的军号，四川籍的同志和“俘虏兵”吊起嗓子大声作答。蠢猪似的敌人万想不到，跟他们平排走的就是他们所日夜梦想着要消灭的英雄红军，糊里糊涂地同我们一道走了二、三十里。后来，雨下的更大，到深夜十二点钟，对岸的那条火龙不见了，当时估计他们大概怕苦不走了。看到敌人宿了营，实在高兴极了，这一情况立刻传遍全团，同志们纷纷议论着：抓紧好机会啊！快走，快走啊！一个跟着一个拚命的向前赶路。
    暴雨冲打着战士，山洪从峰顶直泻大渡河，本已难走的羊肠小道，此刻被雨水冲洗得像浇上了一层油，滑的实在不行，拐杖也不显神通了，一不留神就来个倒栽葱，真说得上三步一摔，五步一跌，队伍简直是在滚进。就是在这样的情况下，还是不断有人打瞌睡。有的人走着走着就站住了，后面的推他：“走呀！前面的走远了！”这才恍然惊醒，又赶快跟上去。后来，大家干脆解下了绑腿，一条一条的接起来，前后拉着走。经过整夜的急行军，在第二天早晨六点多钟胜利地赶到了泸定桥，占领西岸及西桥头。这一天，除了打仗、架桥外还赶了二百四十里路，这真是飞毛腿呀！
    要桥不要枪
    我们占领了桥西的几座建筑和一座意大利天主教堂。战士们忙着晒衣、做饭、休息。王团长和我领着营、连干部去察看地形。
    泸定桥真是个险要所在。就连我们这些逢山开路、遇水架桥、见关夺关的英雄们，都不禁要倒吸一口凉气。往下看，红色的流水像瀑布一样从上游山峡间倾泻下来，冲击着河底参差耸立的恶石，溅起丈多高的白色浪花，流水声响，震耳欲聋。在这样的河里，就是一条小鱼，也休想停留片刻，徒涉、渡船都是完全不可能的事，只有从桥上走。
    再看看桥吧。既不是石桥，也不是木桥，而是一条铁索桥。从东岸到西岸扯了十三根用粗铁环一个套一个联成的长铁索，每根有普通饭碗般大。两边各两根，做成桥栏，底下并排九根，是为桥面。原来桥面上横铺着木板，看来也和普通桥一样，当人走上去时，桥面就随着人的走动晃晃荡荡，像个摇篮。现在，木板已被敌人搬到城里去了，只剩下悬空挂着的乌黑铁索。在桥头的一块石碑上刻着两行诗句：“泸定桥边万重山，高峰入云千里长”。
    泸定桥东端就是泸定城。这座城一半挂在东山上，一半贴着大渡河岸，城墙高两丈余，西城门正堵住桥头，过得桥去，必须通过城门，别无他路。城里驻着两个团的敌人，山坡上严密的布好了阵地。机枪集中在桥头附近，不断地向我们扫射，迫击炮也像连珠般地轰过来。敌人凭着这样的天险，耀武扬威地向我们大声喊叫：“你们飞过来吧！我们交枪啦！”我们的战士则大声回答：“不要你们的枪，只要你们的桥。”
    看完地形后，我们立即组织了一个营的火力机步枪等，封锁沿河东岸敌人增援的道路，因为东岸和西岸一样，也只有一条依山傍水的小道，敌人只有从那条路可到泸定桥。
    紧接着，我们分头到连队进行夺桥的战斗动员。部队掀起了争取当夺桥突击队的热潮。各连都送来了突击队的名单，要求批准他们担任突击任务。
    中午，我们在意大利天主教堂召开了全团干部会议，研究、批准突击队。会议刚开始，对岸轰过来了一排迫击炮弹，天主堂的屋顶被轰开了一个大窟窿，弹片、瓦片直泻而下。大家却一动不动，无数双眼睛一齐怒视东岸。我乘机进行鼓动：“敌人来给我们动员了，我们必须立即打过桥去。现在大家说说该让那个连担任突击”。我刚说完，平时不爱说话的二连长廖大珠刷地站起来，他那矮而结实的身子激动的有点发抖，黝黑的脸一下子红到耳根，他吃力地说：
    “一连过乌江立了功，成为渡乌江模范连，我们要向一连学习，争取当夺取泸定桥的英雄连。”
    “夺桥突击队非给我们三连不可”急性子的三连长王有才没等廖大珠说完就像打机关枪似的说开了：“我们三连那一次战斗都没落后过，这次保证把桥拿下来。”他站在那里像座小铁塔。最后，他又像诉苦一样说：“不叫我们当突击队，我这个连长没法向战士们交代”。往后是一场激烈的争论，看样子谁也不愿意把这个任务让给别人，须要我们领导上指定了。我和团长研究后，王团长向干部们交代了夺桥的任务并指定二连任突击队。接着我站起来补充同大家说：“要打仗有的是，咱们轮着干，上次渡乌江是一连打头，这次轮到二连，由二连的二十二个共产党员和积极分子组成突击队，廖大珠同志任突击队长，我看很好，看大家有没有意见？”会场上响起了一片掌声，廖大珠高兴的跳起来。只有王有才垂着头，嘴里在叨咕着什么。“三连的任务也不轻”我指着王有才说：“你连担任二梯队，跟着突击队冲，还要担任铺桥面的任务，让后续部队迅速冲进城去，看你还有什么意见？”这时王有才才露出笑容。最后我们命令各连把打土豪得来的腊肉每人吃一斤，让部队吃饱饭好打仗。会后，我告诉总支书罗华生到二连去帮助进行突击准备工作。
    总攻在下午四点开始。团长和我在桥头指挥战斗。全团的司号员集中起来吹起冲锋号，所有的武器一齐向对岸敌人开火，枪炮声、喊杀声震撼山谷。二十二位突击英雄手持冲锋枪或短枪，背挂马刀，腰缠十二颗手榴弹在廖大珠连长的率领下，冒着密集的枪弹，攀着桥栏，踏着铁索向对岸冲去。跟着他们前进的是三连长王有才率领的三连指战员。他们除带武器外，每人扛一块木板，边冲锋，边铺桥。当突击队刚冲到对面桥头，西城门突然烧起冲天大火。敌人企图用火把我们挡在东桥头，用火力消灭我们。火光照红了半边天，桥头被熊熊大火包围住了。
    这正是千钧一发的时刻。二十二位英雄看到城门口漫天大火，似乎犹豫了一下，站在我和团长一起的大群人大声喊道：“同志们！这是胜利的关键！冲进去呀！不怕火呀！迟疑不得！冲啊！敌人垮了”。这喊声给了英雄们勇气、决心和力量，在洪亮的冲锋号声中，他们争先恐后地向着火里冲去了。冲在前面的廖大珠连长帽子着了火，他扔掉了帽子，光着头继续往前冲，英雄们的眉毛、头发被火烧卷了，他们仍紧跟着廖连长冒烟突火一直冲进街去，同敌人进行巷战。敌人集中全力反扑过来，二十二位英雄的子弹、手榴弹都打光了，形势万分紧急，眼看支持不住了。正在这个严重关头，王有才连长带着三连冲进来了，接着团长和我率领着二梯队迅速过桥进了城。经过两个小时的激战，两个团的敌人被消灭大半，剩下的混乱溃散。黄昏，我全部占领泸定城，牢靠地控制了泸定桥。
    当前的首要任务是防止敌人的反扑，确保泸定桥的安全。我们立即派出配属我团指挥的军团教导营向打箭炉方向警戒，因为那里尚有刘文辉的几个团。为了对付向泸定桥增援的两旅敌人，我们派出一个营沿河向南发展，至晚上十时尖兵排打起来了，当时，我们估计是敌人的援兵赶到，准备再作一场苦战。该营一部分部队占领了阵地，组织了一个冲锋，抓到了一个伤兵，一问却是我红一师三团的同志，才知道一师已经赶到。准备同敌人作殊死战的紧张心情，顿时轻松下来，部队欢欣若狂。原来敌人的两个旅被我红一师追上，在城南六十里竹林坪地区打了一仗，后来敌人怕我们两头夹击，慌张的向化林坪方向跑了。我们立即派人迎接随红一师前进的刘伯承总参谋长和聂荣臻政委进入泸定城，大家见了面，十分欢喜。
    已经是下半夜两点钟了，刘伯承参谋长仍兴致勃勃地要我带他和聂政委去看泸定桥。我提着马灯，陪着他们从桥东走向桥西。刘伯承参谋长对每根铁索的每个铁环都看的十分仔细，好像要把整座泸定桥印在自己的脑海里。从桥西折回桥中央时，他停住脚步，扶住桥栏，俯视大渡河的急流，着力地在桥板上连蹬三脚，感慨地说：“泸定桥！泸定桥！我们为你花了多少精力，费了多少心血！现在我们胜利了！我们胜利了！”
    从缴获到的敌文件中，翻出了一份刘文辉发出的紧急通报，里面写道：“现在朱、毛等于第二个石达开，前面有大渡河，后面有金沙江，像是瓮中之鳖，消灭共匪，在此一举。”还狂妄地悬赏捉拿我军首长。刘伯承总参谋长看完这份通报后，饶有风趣地说：“敌人倒很器重我们，我的身价还值十万银元”。红军的英雄们则豪迈地说：“我们走的虽然是石达开走过的旧路，但我们不会陷入历史的复辙，而是要开辟光明的、胜利的道路，因为中国工农红军是中国共产党、毛主席领导的人民的武装。”
    第三天，林彪军团长带着军团的主力来到了。他热烈地祝贺我们完成了任务，给我们很大的鼓励。接着毛主席、朱总司令也来了。千军万马从这英雄的泸定桥渡过了天险的大渡河。首先冲过泸定桥的二十二位英雄受到了上级的嘉奖。他们以顽强无畏的战斗行动，为我军的战斗史写下了极其光辉的一页。
