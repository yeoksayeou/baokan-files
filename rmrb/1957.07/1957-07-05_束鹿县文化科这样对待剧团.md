	束鹿 County Cultural Affairs Bureau Treats Theatrical Troupes This Way

　　After Liberation, I and several comrades established a "Red Light Peking Opera Troupe." Initially, we rehearsed a new play "Co-destined Mandarin Ducks," and performed it a few times. Because we had no theater, we stopped performing for more than a year. In 1955, with the high tide of rural collectivization, we went to the countryside for touring performances. When we arrived in Shulu County, Hebei Province, the Shulu County Cultural Affairs Bureau sent people to ask us to cooperate with them. At that time, they readily agreed to everything and said all the right things. So we agreed to first try out the "Red Light Peking Opera Troupe" signboard for three months. But as soon as we started cooperating, they took away our performance permit issued in Beijing. At the same time, they inserted several "actors" who only ate and didn't perform. Without our consent, they put up the signboard of the "Shulu County Peking Opera Troupe." The Cultural Affairs Bureau also sent two cadres to take over the troupe's personnel and accounting power. Not only did the troupe committee not know about anything, but even I, the "troupe leader," had no right to interfere. Later, they went even further and inserted more than a dozen so-called amateur actors who couldn't perform. The troupe became chaotic, and the actors who actually performed couldn't even get enough to eat. Once, during a performance, the Qin player Huo Zhendong made a slight mistake, and the director of the Shulu County Cultural Affairs Bureau, Zhen Feng, immediately dragged him backstage and beat him severely. When I went forward to pull him away and劝劝, he retorted that we were "forming cliques." In such a situation, I was filled with anxiety and anger, and became ill. I had to ask for leave to return to Beijing for treatment. Although the Cultural Affairs Bureau approved my leave, they withheld my privately owned costumes in the troupe.

　　After I returned to Beijing, I wrote to the troupe asking them to send me some medical expenses. But not only did they not send me a single penny for medical expenses, but they didn't even send me my salary for seven months. This forced me to sell everything, and my life fell into dire straits. Now I have no home to return to, no plays to perform, and no costumes to use. I am truly at my wit's end.

    束鹿县文化科这样对待剧团
    解放以后，我和几个同志建立了一个“红光京剧团”。最初排演新戏“同运鸳鸯”，演了几场，因为没有剧场，我们停演了一年多。1955年农村合作化高潮到来，我们就到农村去巡回演出。到河北束鹿县时，束鹿县文化科派人来要求我们和他们合作。那时，他们什么事都满应满许，说尽好话。所以我们同意先仍以“红光京剧团”的招牌试行三个月。但一开始合作，他们先把我们在北京市领的演出证拿走，同时插进好几个净吃饭不演戏的“演员”，没有征得我们的同意，就把“束鹿县京剧团”的招牌打出去了。文化科并派来了二个干部把团里的人事、会计大权都抓了过去，不但遇事团委会不知道，就连我这个“团长”也无权过问。以后，又变本加厉的插进十几个不会演戏的所谓业余演员。把剧团搞得乌烟瘴气，闹得真演戏的演员饭也吃不上。有一次演出，琴师霍振东拉错了一点，当时就被束鹿县文化科长甄峰拉到后台暴打一顿。我上前去拉劝，他反说我们是“搞小圈子”。我处在这样的情况下，急愤交加，把身体也搞病了，不得不请假回京治病。文化科虽然准了我的假，但把我私有的服装，却扣留在团里。
    我回京后，曾去信请团里给我寄点医药费来，但他们不仅没汇过一文医药费，连七个月来的薪金也没有寄给我。使得我变卖一空，生活陷于绝境。我现在无家可归，无戏可唱，无服装可用，真是走投无路。
