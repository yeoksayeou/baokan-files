Southwest Railway Construction Proves the Achievements of the First Five-Year Plan
Lan Tian's Speech

    I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the various reports by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. In particular, studying and discussing Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's government work report has not only greatly elevated our ideological understanding but also strengthened our confidence, inspiring us to redouble our efforts to complete future construction tasks.

    Now, the right-wingers, with malicious intentions and long-held desires, want to overthrow the government, seize the Party's leadership, and move towards the capitalist road they yearn for. They are systematically, organizationally, and actively spreading anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist construction fallacies in major cities across the country, claiming that the country has ruined the First Five-Year Plan and that too many good people have been wrongly accused in the anti-rightist movement. Such exaggerations of mistakes and obliteration of achievements are indeed acts of confusing right and wrong, disrupting order, and defaming the Party and the government. As a technical designer of newly built railways, I firmly oppose this and am willing to work with the broad masses of the people to fight to the end and never give up.

    Here, I will talk about the general situation of railway construction in the Southwest:

    Southwest and Northwest Connected as One

    After the liberation of the Southwest, I received the Party's education and training, and with great excitement and gratitude, I participated in the surveying and design work of the Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, Neijiang-Kunming, and Chengdu-Kunming railways. I also worked on several railways during the reactionary rule and deeply felt the difference between these two different eras. One was an era of man eating man, and the other is a new era with everything proceeding from the interests of the people, that is, the present era. As everyone knows, the people of Sichuan paid a price of bloodshed and sacrifice to oppose the nationalization of railways, and continued to struggle for more than forty years under the old regime, unable to see a single sleeper or an inch of steel rail. After liberation, in 1950, Chairman Mao, in order to realize the wishes of the Sichuan people for more than forty years, actively prepared for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. In just over two years, the 503-kilometer Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was fully opened to traffic. At the same time as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was being built, preparations were also made for the construction of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway (i.e., the Baoji-Chengdu Railway). On July 1, 1952, the same day that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was opened to traffic, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began construction. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the selfless and enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened to traffic to Mianyang on National Day in 1953, to Guangyuan on New Year's Day in 1955, and to Lueyang on New Year's Day in 1956. The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, 455 kilometers long, was fully opened to traffic. On July 1 of the same year, the northern and southern sections were connected, and the 668-kilometer Baoji-Chengdu Railway was fully opened to traffic. Since then, the Southwest and Northwest have been connected as one, and the output and input of people, passengers, materials, and food have exceeded millions of tons. It has played a considerable role in relieving disasters and supplying construction. Other projects such as the Lizhan, Yingxia, and Nanfu railways in the Central-South region, and the Duzhu, Chuanqian, Neikun, and Chenkun railways in the Southwest region, have completed the surveying and design of a total of 2,500 kilometers. Now, the railways in the Central-South region have been completed and opened to traffic, and the railways in the Southwest region are under construction, with some sections already laid. Can it be said that these railways are not construction achievements of the First Five-Year Plan? Is this not a great achievement of the Party's correct leadership and rapid progress? The right-wingers insist that the national plan has been ruined and that there are no achievements, which is truly unconscionable.

    The Difficulty of Building Roads in Mountainous Areas is Rare in the World

    Of course, we still have many shortcomings and mistakes in our work, and some are still serious. Taking the Guangyuan-Lueyang section of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway as an example, the route direction is completely correct, and to this day, no one has proposed any other better route. The reason for the landslides and subgrade diseases is nothing more than two reasons: (1) Due to the low technical level and insufficient experience of the designers, they committed empiricism and dogmatism, generalizing the mountain and ridge section of the route. Moreover, due to the lack of geological personnel, the quality of some documents was poor. During the construction process, in order to rush the task, the construction procedures were not followed, resulting in serious landslide damage during the rainy season. (2) Due to the extremely complex terrain and geology of the Jialing River bank, most of the obvious unfavorable geological sections were avoided or special engineering structures were built to prevent them in advance. All the places that have been treated have not yet collapsed. However, hidden diseases, such as ancient landslides and ancient accumulation bodies, etc., have been excavated, and after the rainy season, the storms and heavy rains, surface water and groundwater seep into the soil, saturating the accumulation body. The yellow soil with water seeps into the sliding surface, increasing the weight of the mountain body, resulting in collapse. In recent years, the central and local governments have attached great importance to this and have concentrated all possible forces to actively deal with it, and have been corrected and overcome. Facts have proved that the representatives departing from Chengdu took the Baoji-Chengdu passenger car and arrived in Baoji safely and on time. Some people say that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is badly damaged and cannot be opened to traffic at all. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is the malicious act of right-wingers who deliberately spread rumors and create trouble, exaggerate mistakes, and confuse people.

    According to Soviet experts, this kind of particularly difficult mountainous area is "rare in the world. It is commendable that Chinese experts and comrades can complete the opening to traffic in such a short period of time." Of course, we cannot be proud of this. We should treat this extremely important route with a humble attitude and protect it with incomparable enthusiasm. We are making a concrete plan to thoroughly cure the diseases in the southern section. In order to save money and not waste a single penny of national construction funds, we must have a long time to explore, observe, investigate, and study, collect reliable data, conduct small-scale experiments, draw conclusions, and produce high-quality, economically reasonable design documents for construction. If we think now that everything is safe and there are no diseases, it is too early to say that. Because the Jialing River bank has landslide areas hundreds of meters deep and ancient accumulation bodies of millions of cubic meters, which are not moving now, but may move under certain circumstances in the future. This is not a problem that modern science can solve. I hope our scientists will do some research on this. With concrete methods, combined with the experience and lessons of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, it will be of great help to the surveying, design and technical design of future high mountain ridges, deep valley horizontal flow mountainous areas in the Southwest, such as the Dianqian, Chuanzang and Lancheng lines.

    Several Suggestions on New Railway Construction in Mountainous Areas in Southwest China

    In addition, in line with the government's call for "increasing production and practicing economy," I would like to make a few suggestions on new railway construction in mountainous areas in Southwest China:

    (1) It is suggested that the state expedite the expansion of the national geodetic plane surveying organization and produce a national geodetic plane map with a scale of 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 with contour lines of 10 meters to 20 meters (details in the proposal). With this detailed map, the required railway lines in mountainous areas can be found on the map. Preliminary surveying and alignment can be dispensed with, which can save a sum of alignment expenses. If major items such as water conservancy planning, national defense planning, and factory and mine arrangements are added, the preliminary field investigation and surveying work can be reduced, and more reliable preliminary plans that are related to and coordinated with other relevant matters can be made or arranged on the detailed map, which will save even more.

    (2) Before this detailed map is made, railway alignment work is an extremely complex and arduous task. It includes the current situation and future development of politics, economy, culture, and education, and is an extremely important basic work in new railway construction. Its quality is also related to the preliminary survey and the final survey. In the past, alignment was often limited by time and budget, and it was impossible to do as much as it should have been possible. Therefore, there were cases of re-alignment in the preliminary survey stage, and there were also cases of re-rough survey and preliminary survey in the final survey stage. The waste of human, material, financial and time resources is truly regrettable. I suggest that each design institute should carry out the alignment work in the rough survey stage separately, and carry out the preliminary survey and alignment in advance according to the national railway network plan, giving priority to the urgent tasks, and compare all possible comparison lines as much as possible, and submit opinions to the Ministry for appraisal and approval. When the task book is issued, a certain standard system will be indicated, so that the preliminary survey and final survey can carry out the task without any worries, which will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort, and achieve no rework and no waste, and saving will be inherent in it.

    (3) It is also necessary to train engineering geological personnel and reserve a large number of drilling machines. In view of the fact that the geological personnel were insufficient in the past, the technology was not high, and the machines were lacking, so it was impossible to collect reliable data as a design basis, which affected the quality of the documents. The design was changed again and again during construction, causing all kinds of delays, reworks and wastes, and also affected the extension of the construction period, delaying the delivery and opening to traffic for operation, which invisibly caused great losses to the country and the people. It is suggested that the government should pay special attention to this. Taking advantage of the fact that a large number of senior high school students have not been admitted to higher education this year, it is necessary to widely recruit and train a large number of engineering geological talents and enrich the reserve force, which will play a certain role in promoting the victorious progress of the transportation industry in the second five-year plan.

    Please criticize whether the above is appropriate.

### 西南的铁路建设证明了第一个五年计划的成就  蓝田的发言

    西南的铁路建设证明了第一个五年计划的成就
    蓝田的发言
    我对周恩来总理、李先念、薄一波两位副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的各项报告完全同意和衷心的拥护。尤其是学习和讨论了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和周总理的政府工作报告，不仅是感觉到把我们思想认识大大地提高一步，更使我们坚定了信心，百倍地为完成今后的建设任务而加倍努力。
    现在右派分子们，居心险恶，宿意已久地想推翻政府。夺取党的领导权，走向他们所喜悦的资本主义道路，有计划有组织有行动地向全国各大城市宣传反党、反人民、反社会主义建设的种种谬论；说国家把第一个五年计划搞坏了，肃反运动中冤屈好人太多了。这样的夸大错误，抹煞成绩，确实是混淆黑白，扰乱是非，污蔑党、污蔑政府的万恶行为。作为一个新建铁路的技术设计人员是坚决反对的，愿同广大人民一道，不斗争到底，决不罢休。
    我在这里谈一谈西南铁路建设经过的大概情形：
    西南西北一脉相通
    西南解放后，我得到党的教育和培养，常抱着极其兴奋和感激的心情，参加了成渝、宝成、内昆、成昆等铁路勘测设计工作。也曾在反动统治时代作过几条铁路的工作，深深地感觉到这两个不同时代，真有天渊之别。一个是人吃人的时代，一个是一切为了人民利益为出发点的新时代，即现在的时代。大家都知道，四川人民为反对铁路收归国有而付出流血牺牲的代价，在旧政权时代继续斗争四十余年直至解放的前夕，看不见一根枕木一寸钢轨。解放后一九五○年毛主席为了实现四川人民四十余年的愿望，积极筹筑成渝铁路，二年多一点五百零三公里的成渝铁路全线通车了。在修建成渝铁路同时，又命作修建宝天铁路的筹备（即宝成铁路），一九五二年七月一日成渝铁路通车的同时宝成路开工了。在中国共产党的正确领导下和苏联专家们无私的热情帮助下，宝成路于一九五三年国庆节通车绵阳，一九五五年元旦通车广元，一九五六年元旦通车略阳。宝成铁路南段四百五十五公里全部通车了。同年七月一日南北两段接轨，宝成铁路长六百六十八公里全线通车。从此西南西北一脉相通，人客物资粮食等输出输入何止数百万吨。对救济灾荒，供给建设，曾起着相当大的作用。其他如中南区的黎湛、鹰厦、南福铁路。西南区的都筑、川黔、内昆、成昆等路的勘测设计共完成二千五百公里。现在中南区的铁路业已完工通车了，西南区的铁路正在施工中，亦有一部分铺轨了。难道说这些铁路不是第一个五年计划中的建设成绩吗？这不是党的正确领导，突飞猛进的伟大成就吗？右派分子偏说是国家计划搞坏了，没有成绩，真是丧尽良心。
    山岳地区筑路的困难程度世所罕有
    当然我们工作中的缺点和错误还是很多的，有一部分还是严重的。如以宝成南段广元至略阳一段来说，线路方向是完全正确的，至今日为止没有一人提出还有其他较好路线。其所以有塌方有路基病害，不外有两个原因：（一）由于设计人员的技术水平低、经验不够，犯了经验主义、教条主义，把高山大岭一段路线一般化，更因地质人员缺乏，有一部分文件质量差，在施工过程中为了赶任务，没有按照施工程序进行，因之在雨季时，发生塌方的严重病害。（二）由于嘉陵江岸的地形地质极其复杂，显明的不良地质地段，大部分是避开了，或者作出特种工程建筑预先防止了，凡是处理过的地方至今并没有发生坍塌情事。但是隐藏着的病害，如古滑坡，古堆积体等等都在开挖之后经过雨季的大风暴雨，地面水和地下水渗透为害，使堆积体饱和，水带黄土渗入滑面，使山体重量增加，因而坍塌。近年来中央和地方十分重视，曾集中一切可能集中的力量积极处理，已得到纠正和克服。事实证明，此次由成都出发的代表乘坐宝成客车，是安全正点到达宝鸡的。有人说宝成路坏得很，根本不能通车，这是完全不符事实的，存心造谣生事的右派分子，扩大错误、混乱人心的恶意罢了。
    此种特殊困难山岳地区，据苏联专家说：“在世界上也是少有的，中国专家同志们能在短短的时间内完成通车，这是难能可贵的。”当然我们不能因此而骄傲，我们应当以虚心的态度来对待这个极其重要的路线，要以无比兴奋的热情来保护。我们正在作彻底根治南段病害的具体计划。为了节约，为了不浪费一文国家建设资金，就必须要有一个较长时间来探钻、观察、调查、研究，收集确实可靠资料，经过小型试验，得出结论，作出质量良好的经济合理的设计文件交付施工。如现在就认为是一切安全，没有一点病害发生了，这也未免说的太早。因为嘉陵江岸有数百公尺深的滑坡地带，有数百万公方的古堆积体，现在没有动，将来或许在某种情况下就能活动，这也不是现代科学所能解决的问题，希望我们科学家对此作些研究工作。有了具体办法，再结合着宝成路的经验教训，对于今后西南的高山大岭，深谷横流山岳地区，如滇黔、川藏、兰成等路线的勘测设计和技术设计是有极大帮助的。
    对西南山区新建铁路的几点建议
    此外我本着政府“增产节约”的号召，对西南山岳地区新建铁路提出几点建议：
    （1）建议国家从速扩大全国大地平面测量机构，赶制出全国大地平面图比例尺为五万分之一或二万五千分之一的具有等高线十公尺至二十公尺（办法详见提案）。有了此种详图，所需要的山岳地区铁路线，都可从图上找出。草测选线这个可以不需要去作，就可节省一笔选线经费，若加以水利计划和国防计划，以及厂矿安排等重大事项，都能减少初步实地调查勘测工作，而能在详细图上，作出或安排出较为可靠的与其他有关联和互相配合的初步计划，那就节约更多了。
    （2）在此详细大地图未曾制出之前，铁路选线工作，是一种极其复杂而艰巨的工作。它包括着政治、经济、文化、教育各方面的现在情况及将来发展情况，是一件新建铁路中极其重要的基本工作。它的质量好坏亦关联着初测和定测。过去的选线，每每是限于时间，限于预算，不能尽量作到它应当作到的可能工作。因而在初测阶段中有重作选线的事实，定测阶段中亦有重作草测初测之事。人力物力财力和时间的浪费真觉可惜。我建议各设计院，应当把草测阶段的选线工作，单独进行，照国家路网规划分别先后缓急提前草测选线，尽量把所有可能比较的一切比较线都把它测量比较，提出意见呈部鉴定批准。任务书下达时即提示一定的标准法制，使初测定测，毫无顾虑地执行任务，必能收事半功倍之效，做到不返工不浪费，节约自在其中。
    （3）培养工程地质人员，储备大量探钻机具也是必要的。鉴于从前的地质人员不够，技术不高，机具缺乏，不能收集确实可靠资料作为设计依据，影响文件质量，在施工中一再变更设计，造成种种窝工返工浪费，也曾影响到延展工期，拖长交付通车营运期限，无形中造成国家和人民的大损失，建议政府应特别重视这一点。趁着本年高中生有大量未得升学时，广为招考，大量培养工程地质人材、充实后备力量，对促进第二个五年计划的交通事业胜利的向前迈进，是有一定的作用的。
    以上所述是否有当，敬请批评。
