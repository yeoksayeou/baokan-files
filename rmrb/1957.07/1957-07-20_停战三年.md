Three Years Since the Ceasefire
By Xiao Guang, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

I.

The Geneva Accords were signed a full three years ago. Commemorating this day, the Vietnamese people are not so calm. Here, almost everyone ecstatically welcomed the day of restored peace, and since then, people have been counting down the days to the general election for reunification. However, disappointing news has repeatedly come from the other side of the 17th parallel. Three years since the ceasefire, the South Vietnamese authorities have left behind a series of violations of the agreement in the International Commission's investigation book and in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. A year has passed since the date stipulated in the agreement for the general election, yet the Ngo Dinh Diem regime still refuses to consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the general election.

This situation cannot but arouse the worries, indignation, and even mixed feelings of the Vietnamese people. For the vast majority of Vietnamese people, peaceful reunification is not only a simple political issue but also a matter of vivid emotion.

In Vietnam, no matter where you go or who you talk to, you will always hear people talking about the South with infinite affection after only a few sentences.

Those South Vietnamese soldiers who gathered in the North miss their hometowns and relatives even more. They often recall the past when they gathered in the North. At that time, the villagers who had labored and fought together for many years stayed up all night to repair bridges and build roads for them, steaming cakes and making pastries; they saw them off reluctantly, again and again. At the time of parting, they said, "Children, see you again in two years!"

Thinking that the land in the South is suffering and that the compatriots in the South are still living in dire straits, people's hearts ache like a knife. In the theater, the audience watches dramas about South Vietnam with tears in their eyes. Every plant and tree in the set evokes the audience's infinite feelings, and every dialogue makes them sigh and lament. People newly arrived from South Vietnam are often surrounded and asked questions; even though they feel more and more sad as they listen, they still want to listen and ask. Children from the South receive special love and care; the Southern Kindergarten in Hanoi often receives gifts from "uncles and aunts whose names are not known."

The Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification is not just lip service. In addition to lamenting and sighing, people take more practical actions. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam initially put forward the slogan "Intensify construction and consolidate the North, resolutely struggle and realize reunification," guiding the people to strive for national reunification with outstanding labor and struggle.

In the past three years, under the leadership of the government, the Vietnamese people have achieved tremendous achievements through selfless labor. It is enough to list some of the figures and facts in this regard.

First of all, in agriculture, in the two years or so from the ceasefire to the end of 1956, 115,000 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed, accounting for 85% of the wasteland area in the North; all the large-scale water conservancy projects destroyed in the war have been restored. In addition, eight new large-scale water conservancy projects have been built, and many small and medium-sized irrigation systems have been developed. Under the threat of drought, wind disasters, and floods, farmers fought against the disasters day and night regardless of difficulties and dangers, resulting in continuous increases in rice production. In 1956, rice production was 4,132,000 tons, exceeding the level of 1939, the highest pre-war year. For the first time in Vietnamese history, the grain shortage during the lean season was eliminated.

In terms of industry, more than a dozen mines and factories, such as the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, and the Hai Phong Cement Plant, have all been restored. The eighteen factories established during the War of Resistance have been expanded. In addition, eighteen new industrial and mining enterprises with modern equipment have been established, and the industrial output value is growing rapidly. The total industrial output value in 1955 was 90 billion (Vietnamese currency), and it has increased to more than 280 billion in 1956.

The transportation industry, which was severely devastated by the war, has been largely restored. 526 kilometers of railways have been repaired, and the remaining 513 kilometers are under construction. In addition to the full restoration of the original 3,800 kilometers of highways, 201 kilometers of new highways have been built. Inland river and coastal routes are all unimpeded.

The Vietnamese people view the struggle to reunify the country as their own cause and contribute greater efforts to it as much as possible.

II.

Separated by only a river, South Vietnam presents a completely different picture to people.

Here, the Geneva Accords are met with hostility, opposition, and resistance from the authorities everywhere. It is said that the United States put Ngo Dinh Diem in power before the signing of the agreement precisely to undermine the Geneva Accords. No wonder the Ngo Dinh Diem regime initially designated the day the agreement was signed as "National Humiliation Day," ordering the people of South Vietnam to wear mourning clothes to show their sorrow. For three years, the Ngo Dinh Diem group has followed the will of the United States, repeatedly violating the agreement to serve the US conspiracy to divide Vietnam and monopolize South Vietnam for a long time. There are too many examples of this to list.

Despite the agreement prohibiting the import of all reinforcements, military auxiliary personnel, and war materials, American military personnel and tens of thousands of tons of war materials have arrived at South Vietnam's airports and seaports one after another. The number of American military advisers has increased from more than 200 at the time of the ceasefire to more than 2,000 at present. Their Japanese and Filipino assistants are not included in this number. The South Vietnamese army is all wearing American-style uniforms with large pockets, and the dilapidated French weapons have been replaced by American ones. The International Commission has concluded eight times that South Vietnam has violated Articles 16 and 17 of the Geneva Accords, but the South Vietnamese regime has turned a deaf ear.

All military bases have been expanded. At present, the airports in Saigon, Bien Hoa, Vung Tau, Da Nang, Hue, Buon Ma Thuot, and other places can all accommodate heavy aircraft for take-off and landing. Da Nang Port can now berth small aircraft carriers and is being continuously expanded into a military base for "joint military services." The United States is also carrying out large-scale construction in the high-altitude Central Highlands, preparing to build a "first-class strategic base in Southeast Asia."

The Ngo Dinh Diem regime has continuously violated the demilitarized zone, with 388 incidents from November 1954 to April this year. More than 2,000 people have been victimized in these incidents. Military and political personnel headed by South Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho and American military advisers have also illegally broken into the demilitarized zone, using telescopes to spy on the North and take pictures.

The South Vietnamese regime has carried out planned suppression of former resistance personnel and people who demand peaceful reunification. In the past three years, tens of thousands of people have been arrested and killed. Ngo Dinh Diem's reactionary armed "Security Corps" in the countryside often cooperates with the regular army to carry out "Communist suppression campaigns," slaughtering the people. In order to "help maintain rural order and suppress Communists," the United States specially sent 195 jeeps to the South Vietnamese "Security Corps" in May this year and decided to send three police officers, including Updike, the director of the New York State Criminal Investigation Bureau, to South Vietnam to help establish a police force.

The Ngo Dinh Diem regime has been eager to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; although it has not dared to formally participate due to world opinion, it has repeatedly sent people to attend meetings, visit military exercises, and exchange military delegations with member states... maintaining extremely close relations.

As for the issue of holding a national general election, Ngo Dinh Diem first clamored that "South Vietnam is not a signatory country" and refused to negotiate, while enjoying all the rights of the agreement as the successor to one of the signatory countries; then he slandered that "North Vietnam has no freedom" and used the excuse that "two different social systems are irreconcilable" to suppress the people's desire for free and fair elections; on the one hand, he carried out unilateral elections and formulated a constitution, refusing all suggestions to restore normal relations between the two sides, in an attempt to turn South Vietnam into a separate country opposed to the North.

Obviously, the United States is satisfied with Ngo Dinh Diem's achievements, believing that its huge sum of more than 880 million US dollars in the past three years has not been spent in vain. On the important buildings in South Vietnam, the American stars and stripes have replaced the French tricolor flag since 1955. American goods are flooding into all the cities of South Vietnam like a tide, and American military jeeps can drive straight into various villages and towns. American "advisers" have infiltrated all departments of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, and they have to ask about even the smallest details. The South Vietnamese army has also been grabbed in the hands of the United States for a long time, and every company has American instructors. Whenever a conflict occurs, the American instructors imitate their former chief O'Daniel, slamming the table and shouting, "Who gave the money!", and the problem often ends there.

The attitude of the American officers and soldiers towards the ordinary people of South Vietnam is even more savage, scolding, teasing, beating, shooting... they are simply unscrupulous. Even the reporter of the Indian "Lightning" newspaper who visited Saigon suspected "whether the Americans live on Ngo Dinh Diem's territory, or Ngo Dinh Diem lives on American territory." Ngo Dinh Diem, however, is not ashamed, but proudly declares that "the borders of the United States extend to the 17th parallel."

But don't think that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime can maintain such a situation for long. The people of South Vietnam yearn for the restoration of freedom and independence, and they have shown by their actions that they are unwilling to be "people under American boots." Even some American journalists have pointed out: "An atmosphere of hostility surrounds everything with American markings."

This statement is not an exaggeration. In January this year, the South Vietnamese business community held a "National Goods Week" to launch a movement to boycott American goods. Conflicts between South Vietnamese officers and soldiers and American advisers have occurred repeatedly. South Vietnamese soldiers also burned American-aided ammunition depots, barracks, and vehicles in February last year.

In addition, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is also facing an increasingly strong voice from the people demanding peaceful reunification. Although Ngo Dinh Diem has placed 40,000 policemen in Saigon, a city with less than two million people; although letters are opened, telephones are eavesdropped on, and large-scale searches are frequently carried out, news from North Vietnam still circulates among people of all strata, and intellectuals still gather to discuss the issue of demanding general elections. Even those "country bumpkins" that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime doesn't care about have submitted thousands of petitions to the International Commission since July, demanding consultation on elections. On "May Day" this year, a demonstration of more than 200,000 people was held in Saigon. Although the authorities had rigorously checked the slogans in advance, people spontaneously shouted the voices from the bottom of their hearts midway: "Unify the country by peaceful means!" "Oppose the division of the country, patriots do not distinguish between North and South!" "Demand free communication and free remittance with the North!" The South Vietnamese authorities sent police and troops to disrupt the demonstration, but many of them shouted the same slogans while walking.

Like the people of North Vietnam, the will of the people of South Vietnam to demand peaceful reunification is also very common and firm. Even centenarians are learning to read, so as not to be deceived during the general election. It can be believed that after a long, arduous, and complex struggle, the 17th parallel, which serves as a temporary military demarcation line, will definitely be removed, and the peaceful reunification of Vietnam will definitely be realized.

    停战三年
    本报驻越南记者  萧光
    一
    日内瓦协议签订整三年了。纪念这个日子，越南人民的心情并不那么平静。这里，几乎每一个人都曾欣喜若狂地迎接过恢复和平的那一天，从此人们就屈指等待普选统一的日子。然而，从十七度线那一边却屡次传来令人失望的消息。停战三年，南越当局在国际委员会的调查簿上、在越南人民的心里，留下的是一连串违反协议的记录。协议规定的普选日期过去一年，吴庭艳政权仍然拒绝同越南民主共和国协商普选。
    这种情况不能不引起越南人民的忧虑、愤慨以至心绪万端。因为对于绝大多数的越南人来说，和平统一不仅是单纯的政治问题，而且是活生生的感情问题。
    在越南，你不管走到哪里，或是跟谁聊天，谈不了几句，总会听到人们无限深情地谈到南方。
    那些北上集结的南越战士，对自己的故乡和亲人更是万分思念。他们不时提起北上集结的往事。那时候，多年在一起劳动和战斗的乡亲父老，彻夜不眠地为他们修桥铺路，蒸糕做饼；依依不舍地送了一程又一程。在别离的时候，他们说过：“孩子，两年以后再见！”
    想起南方的土地正在遭难，想起南方的同胞还在水深火热里过日子，人们的心就像刀割一样的疼痛。剧场里，观众噙着眼泪观看描写关于南越的戏剧，布景的一草一木都引起观众的无限感触，每一段对话都能使他们唏嘘和叹息。从南越新来的人，时常被包围起来问长问短；人们尽管越听越伤心，还是要听要问。从南方来的孩子受到特别的爱抚和照顾；河内的南方幼儿园经常收到“不知道哪一位叔叔和姑姑”送的礼物。
    越南人民要求和平统一的愿望，不是停留在口上，人们除了感慨和叹息，更多的是实际的行动。越南民主共和国政府一开始就提出
  “加紧建设、巩固北方，坚决斗争、实现统一”的口号，引导人民用出色的劳动和斗争来争取国家统一。
    三年来，越南人民在政府领导下，以忘我的劳动取得了巨大的成就，这方面只要列举一些其中的数字和事实就够了。
    首先是农业，从停战到1956年年底为止的两年多的时间内，已经开垦了十一万五千公顷荒地，占北方荒地面积的85％；在战争中被破坏的大型水利工程全部恢复了。而且还新建了八个大型水利工程，发展了许多中小型灌溉系统。在旱灾、风灾和水涝的威胁下，农民不顾艰难危险，不分昼夜同灾害作斗争，结果使稻谷的产量连年上升。1956年稻谷产量为四百十三万二千吨，超过了战前产量最高年度1939年的水平，在越南历史上第一次消除了青黄不接时期的缺粮现象。
    工业方面，鸿基煤矿、南定纺织厂、海防水泥厂等十几个矿山和工厂，已经全部恢复。抗战期间建立的十八个工厂已经扩建。此外还新建立了十八个近代化设备的工矿企业，工业产值正在迅速地增长，1955年工业总产值是九百亿元（越币），1956年已增至两千八百多亿元。
    遭到战争严重摧残的交通运输业，大部分已经恢复，铁路修复了五百二十六公里，其余五百十三公里正在修建中。原有的三千八百公里公路全部恢复以外，还增修了二百零一公里的新公路。内河和沿海的航线已全部通行无阻。
    越南人民是这样把统一国家的斗争看成是自己的事业，而尽量为它贡献出更大的力量。
    二
    仅仅一江之隔，南越呈现给人们的却完全是另一幅图画。
    这里，日内瓦协议处处遭到当局的敌视、反对和抵制。据说，美国在协议签字前把吴庭艳搞上台，正是为了破坏日内瓦协议。难怪吴庭艳政权一开始就把协议签订的日子订为“国耻日”，勒令南越人民披麻戴孝，以示哀悼；三年来，吴庭艳集团秉承美国的意旨，一再违反协议，为实现美国长期分裂越南、独占南越的阴谋效劳。这方面的事例，实在举不胜举。
    尽管协议规定禁止运入一切增援部队、军事辅助人员和作战物资；美国军事人员和成万吨作战物资，接连到达南越的机场和海港。美国军事顾问的人数，由停战时的二百多名增加到目前的二千多名，他们的日本和菲律宾助理人员还不包括在内。南越军队全部穿上了大口袋的美式军装，破旧的法国武器一律换成美国的。国际委员会八次作出结论，指明南越违反日内瓦协议的第十六、十七条款，南越政权却充耳不闻。
    所有的军事基地都得到扩建，现今西贡、边和、头顿、土伦、顺化、邦美蜀等地的机场，全可供重型飞机起落。土伦港已能停泊小型航空母舰，正在被继续扩建为“联合军种”的军事基地。美国还在地势很高的西原地带大兴土木，准备建造“东南亚第一流的”战略基地。
    吴庭艳政权侵犯非军事区的事件不断发生，从1954年11月到今年4月已达三百八十八起。在这些事件中，受害的有二千多人。以南越副总统阮玉书为首的军政人员和美国军事顾问，也不断非法闯入非军事区；用望远镜窥探北方、摄取照片。
    南越政权对前抗战人员和要求和平统一的人民进行了有计划的镇压。三年来，已有成千上万的人被逮捕和杀害。吴庭艳在农村的反动武装“保安团”，经常配合正规军进行“肃共战役”，屠杀人民。为了“帮助维持农村秩序和灭共工作”，美国在今年5月，专门送给南越“保安团”一百九十五辆吉普车，并决定派遣三名包括纽约州罪犯调查局局长厄普代克在内的警官前往南越，帮助建立警察部队。
    对于参加东南亚军事条约组织，吴庭艳政权一直跃跃欲试；虽然碍于世界舆论，它未敢正式参加，但屡次派人列席会议、参观军事演习，同各成员国交换军事代表团……保持着极为密切的关系。
    至于举行全国普选的问题，吴庭艳先是叫嚷“南越不是签字国”拒绝协商，同时却作为签字国一方的继承者，享受着协议的一切权利；继而诬蔑“北越没有自由”，并以“两种不同的社会制度不可调和”为借口，压制人民自由普选的愿望；一面进行片面选举、制定宪法，拒绝一切恢复两方面正常关系的建议，企图把南越变为一个跟北方对立的单独国家。
    显然，美国对吴庭艳的成绩表示满意，认为它三年来八亿八千多万美元的巨款没有白花。在南越各重要的建筑物上，美国的星条旗，从1955年起就代替了法国的三色旗。美国货像潮水似的涌进南越所有的城市，美国军用吉普车可以长驱直入各个村镇。美国“顾问”渗透到吴庭艳政府的一切部门，哪怕是最小的细节，他们也要过问。南越军队也早被抓在美国手里，每个连都有美国教官。每当冲突发生，美国教官就仿效他们的前任首长奥丹尼尔，拍桌子大喊：“谁给的钱！”，问题也往往就此不了了之。
    对于南越的普通人民，美国官兵的态度更加横蛮，辱骂、调戏、毒打、枪杀……简直无恶不作。以至访问过西贡的印度“闪电”周报记者怀疑“究竟是美国人生活在吴庭艳的领土上，还是吴庭艳生活在美国领土上”。吴庭艳却不以为耻，反以为荣地宣称“美国的边界一直延长到十七度线”。
    但是不要以为这样的局面吴庭艳政权能够维持多久。南越人民渴望恢复自由和独立，他们已用行动表示出不愿做“美国皮靴底下的人”。连一些美国新闻记者也已指出：“在一切具有美国标记的东西周围，都笼罩着仇视的气氛。”
    这种说法并不夸张。今年1月，南越工商界举办“国货周”就是想从此展开一个抵制美国货的运动。南越官兵同美国顾问之间的冲突连连发生。南越士兵也曾在去年2月焚烧美国援助的弹药库、兵营和车辆。
    此外，吴庭艳政权还面临着日益加强的人民要求和平统一的呼声。尽管吴庭艳在不到二百万人口的西贡，安插了四万名警察；尽管信件被拆阅，电话被偷听，经常进行大搜查，北越的消息照样在各阶层人民中间流传，知识界人士仍旧集会讨论要求普选的问题。连那些吴庭艳政权没瞧在眼里的“乡巴佬”，7月以来，也已向国际委员会投了几千封要求协商选举的请愿书。今年“五一”节，西贡举行了二十多万人的示威游行，虽然当局事先对标语口号进行了严厉的检查，人们在中途仍然不约而同地呼出了心底的声音：“用和平方法统一国家！”“反对分裂国家，爱国者不分南北！”“要求同北方自由通讯、自由汇兑！”南越当局派了警察和军队去捣乱，但其中许多人走着走着也喊起同样的口号来。
    同越南北方一样，南越人民要求和平统一的意志也十分普遍而坚定，连百岁以上的老人都在学识字，为的是普选的时候不受人欺骗。可以相信，经过长期的、艰苦的、复杂的斗争，作为临时军事分界线的十七度线一定会被撤销，越南的和平统一，一定能够实现。（附图片）
    印度支那停战以来，“为祖国统一而斗争”已成为越南人民一致的呼声。这是1956年7月22日在宜安举行的有两万人参加的群众大会。
