Political and Ideological Work is the Soul of All Work
Yao Guang, Secretary of the CPC Taian County Committee

    Over the past month, Taian County has launched a political and ideological education movement centered on class education among rural party members, cadres, and the broad masses. This ideological education movement has expanded and strengthened the socialist ideological front, raised the ideological awareness of party members, cadres, and farmers, and some inflammatory right-wing remarks have been criticized by the masses, and the face of practical work has changed.

    As a member of the leadership of this work, I first received a profound class education. At the same time, I also deeply realized that the rural party organization cannot abandon political and ideological education for farmers for even a moment. Without ideological work, farmers will lose their direction, the party's policies will be implemented weakly, and anti-socialist ideas, words, and deeds will have an opportunity. Political and ideological work is the soul of all our work.

Problems in Victorious Advance

    Since the realization of agricultural cooperativization last year, the socialist consciousness of farmers in Taian County has greatly improved, the ability of cadres to lead the collective economy is gradually increasing, and the broad masses of grassroots cadres have begun to change from laymen to experts.

    Last year—the first year after cooperativization—on the basis of the continuous consolidation of the vast number of cooperatives, both wheat and autumn crops in our county achieved bumper harvests, and more than 80% of farmers increased their income. This year, wheat has once again achieved a bumper harvest, and autumn seedlings are growing vigorously, with great hopes for a bumper harvest. With the increase in production, the lives of farmers have improved somewhat. In the plain grain-producing areas, the actual rationed grain received per person last year was more than 400 jin. During this year's wheat harvest, more than half of the households ate old wheat flour and corn pancakes. In the mountainous and hilly economic crop areas, the average actual grain ration per person last year was also close to 400 jin. According to a survey in Daolang District (hilly), 60% of the households stored dried melon or miscellaneous grains during this year's wheat harvest. Even in the mountainous areas such as Xiagang and Mata, which have historically had a half-year of bran and vegetables regardless of whether it was a good year or a bad year, people did not resort to tree leaves this spring.

    In such a great leap forward and victorious advance, some problems also emerged in the countryside this spring. These problems are concentrated on the issue of grain. Some people, because they cannot currently satisfy their demands for eating fine grains, or cannot engage in grain sideline businesses, shout that grain is tight; some wealthy farmers who have temporarily reduced their income, or farmers who have opinions on certain work of the cooperative, also shout that grain is tight, thus forming a widespread phenomenon of "reporting shortages even when not short, reporting more shortages than there are, reporting shortages late and early, and registering in advance." This situation has continued into this year's summer grain purchase work. In the grain distribution work, the state proposed "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement," taking into account the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members. However, some agricultural cooperatives disregarded the state and only cared about themselves. Some adopted methods such as prioritizing private interests over public interests, using old scales for distribution and market scales for calculation, only calculating the entire field and not the end of the field, concealing output, increasing the dry rate, and retaining more seeds and feed, to resist the state's unified purchase policy. Therefore, our county's unified purchase task once plummeted. In terms of the thinking of cadres and the masses, since the implementation of Chairman Mao's instruction on "correctly handling contradictions among the people," 100% of rural cadres have participated in actual production, the style of coercion and command has been greatly reduced, and incidents of violations of law and discipline have almost disappeared. The spirit of "only allow persuasion, not coercion" has been reflected in the actual actions of the vast number of cadres. Many comrades have shown the noble qualities of being humble, tolerant, hardworking, and dedicated, “not hitting back when hit, and not responding when cursed." However, due to insufficient publicity and implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions to rural party members, cadres, and farmers, coupled with the recent upsurge of a typhoon against the Party and against socialism stirred up by a few right-wing elements, some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in rural areas took the opportunity to instigate the masses, attempting to destroy the socialist system; some farmers did not understand their conspiracy and were deceived, and their backwardness in thinking developed to some extent. Under these circumstances, rural party members, cadres, and the broad masses of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, on the one hand, asked the leadership to support them, and on the other hand, because of the lack of ideological armament, could not refute many fallacies with justification. This has had a great impact on summer production, distribution, and grain purchase work.

The Nature of the Problems and Solutions

    What is the nature of the above problems? Today, when the large-scale class struggle has basically ended, and the struggle between the two roads has achieved basic victory in the system, contradictions within the people in the countryside have risen to a major position. In the countryside, although there are many aspects of contradictions, the basic contradictions are the contradiction that the growth rate of production cannot keep up with the people's needs for life, and the contradiction that capitalist ideology and the concept of small producers and small private owners are not compatible with the socialist system. These contradictions cannot but be manifested through distribution, supply and demand, and the relationship between cadres and the masses. Some people are not yet satisfied with eating coarse grains and eating their fill, and demand to eat fine grains, ignoring the interests of the country, coldly treating the country's industrialization, and demanding that the country purchase less grain and sell more; some people still lack the habit of collective production, saying that cooperativization is good, but the system is unbearable. They demand that grassroots cadres respond to their wishes by accommodating superiors. When cadres cannot act according to their wishes, they are dissatisfied, complain, and make noise.

    The objective reality is like this, but from a subjective point of view, the leading aspect of the contradiction lies in the leadership. Bureaucratism and subjectivism in the leadership do not understand the actual demands of the masses, and the style is not very democratic, etc., which have caused many shortcomings in actual work. Especially important is that in the past year or more, the political and ideological education work for farmers has been abandoned. Many farmers are unclear about their position and right and wrong in the great social changes. They do not feel that the quality of national construction is as closely related to their lives and property as the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and we have not reminded them in time, stimulated their class emotions, and raised their socialist consciousness, so that they can correctly understand the relationship between national construction and people's livelihood, production, accumulation and consumption, industry and agriculture, long-term interests and current interests. Therefore, it is not surprising that the above contradictions will become increasingly apparent. We believe that the best way to solve these contradictions, in addition to leading the vast number of farmers to increase production and practice thrift, work hard, and strive to change the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in a considerable period of time, is to strengthen political and ideological work in rural areas at present, which is a panacea for solving and easing these contradictions.

Our Attempt

    In view of the above situation, and according to the provincial party committee's emergency notice on strengthening class education at the grassroots level, we have launched a class education movement for rural cadres and the broad masses since late June. In the spirit that educators must first be educated, we successively held two expanded county party committee meetings (attended by district party secretaries). First, we ideologically armed the leading backbone of the county and districts. Then, the secretary and members went to the countryside to give guidance, and Chen Chao, deputy secretary of the county party committee, and Guo Yuquan, deputy minister of the propaganda department of the county party committee, led eight cadres to carry out pilot work in Yamaguchi District. Then, using the experience of the pilot, we guided the county to carry out this movement. Judging from the general situation of the county, in terms of content, it is mostly based on class education, appropriately exposing the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements, and forcefully counterattacking the words and deeds of right-wing elements who oppose the leadership of the party and oppose socialism through the superiority of cooperativization and the education of the socialist future. At the same time, we carried out education on correctly handling contradictions among the people, emphasized unity and concerted efforts to build socialism, and called on farmers to counterattack the reactionary words and deeds of right-wing elements with practical actions to do a good job in current work. In terms of methods, we still used the experience of going from top to bottom, from inside the party to outside the party, recalling the past, comparing the present, looking forward to the future, and deepening the educational effect through personal experience. When carrying out the above education, we also emphasized suiting measures to local conditions and using them flexibly. At present, in all the townships and villages that have done this, the socialist atmosphere is thriving and the face of various tasks has been completely renewed.

    First, 70% to 80% of grassroots cadres have changed from being passively retreated to being active, willing to do things, and forging ahead. In Taiping Cooperative of Yamaguchi Township, there were originally twenty-three cadres above the level of team leader and captain who were negative, wavering, and wanted to resign. After class education, twenty people became active. Captain Wang Jinming said: "Before liberation, I worked for the landlord and was poor for 360 days a year. I couldn't support my family, and my wife begged for food for eight months a year. After the land reform, I turned over, and now one of my children is a national cadre and two of my children are in elementary school. If I don't do it, who will!" The eighteen cadres of Yongjian Cooperative in Zhangjiahu recalled a ballad that was popular in the village in the old society: "Zhangjiahu, near the west river, poor people work for the landlord, bran pancakes in a pile, salted vegetables in a bowl, scallion pancakes can't be seen, you can't eat enough and you have to work more, who can you tell the pain in your heart!" This ballad stimulated their class feelings, and they said: "The Communist Party came and turned us over, and cooperativization dug out the roots of poverty. Whoever opposes the Communist Party and opposes socialism, we will fight them to the end!" And they are determined to run the cooperative well, do a good job in production, and defend socialism.

    Secondly, socialist thought has also been unprecedentedly improved among the broad masses. Especially the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are even more delighted and justifiably proud. When implementing class education in Yaozhuang Township, Fanzhen District, many poor peasants stood up on the spot and said: "When implementing the general line and realizing cooperativization, the poor peasants straightened their backs. But after cooperativization, some people only pick on the thorns, saying that this is not good and that is not good, making us not able to straighten our backs, this time we can straighten our backs!" The masses of Zhou Dian Village, who had caused trouble in the past, said: "The former puppet baozhang beat us and scolded us, and the current cadres lead us to produce and live a good life. Whoever makes trouble again is unconscionable." A military dependent in Matou Village, Zhou Dian District, who had beaten cadres and incited withdrawal from the cooperative, took the initiative to find cadres to confess and apologize after receiving education. After receiving education, the members of Minfeng Second Cooperative in the district exposed Gu Guizhen, a counter-revolutionary who incited them to stop production. In short, in the countryside, the socialist atmosphere has greatly risen, and backward remarks have been greatly reduced. Anti-socialist remarks have been exposed and criticized by the broad masses.

    Thirdly, class education has become a huge driving force for promoting current work. The attendance rate of co-op members has improved significantly. Striving for a bumper autumn harvest has become the conscious action of the broad masses. After class education, Liaoyuan Central Cooperative in Yaozhuang Township excavated seventeen kinds of fertilizer sources to make up for the shortage of chemical fertilizers. The autumn crops of the third production team, which had reduced production in the spring, were fertilized with seven and a half carts of fertilizer per mu, with some left over. On one day in early July, a total of 2,600 hoes were mobilized from 1,400 households in the township. The county's unified purchase task has risen from 11 million jin when it was falling to more than 15 million jin. Our political and ideological education work in rural areas is only the beginning and must be further deepened. As long as we regularly persist in doing a good job in ideological work, we will be able to do all the work vividly and colorfully.

    政治思想工作是一切工作的灵魂
    中共泰安县委书记　姚光
    泰安县最近一个月来，在农村党员、干部和广大群众中展开了一次以阶级教育为主的思想教育运动。这次思想教育运动，扩大和坚定了社会主义思想阵地，提高了党员、干部和农民群众的思想觉悟，一些带有煽惑性的右派言论受到群众的抨击，实际工作的面貌改观了。
    作为领导这一工作的一员，我首先受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。同时，我也深深体会到：农村党组织一时一刻也不能放弃对农民的政治思想教育。没有思想工作，就会使农民迷失方向，就会使党的政策贯彻无力，就会给反社会主义的思想、言论和行动以可乘之机。政治思想工作，是我们一切工作的灵魂。
    胜利前进中的问题
    泰安县农村，自去年实现农业合作化后，农民的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，干部领导集体经济的能力在逐步增强，广大的基层干部已开始由外行变内行。
    去年——合作化后的第一年，在广大合作社不断巩固的基础上，我县麦秋作物都获得了丰收，80％以上的农民增加了收入。今年小麦又获得丰收，秋苗茁壮，大有丰收希望。随着生产的提高，农民的生活已有所改善。平原产粮地区，去年每人实际分到的口粮均在四百斤以上，今年麦收时，有半数以上的农户吃陈小麦面和玉米煎饼；山区、丘陵经济作物地区，去年每人平均实际分粮也接近四百斤。据在道朗区（丘陵）调查，今年麦收时，有60％的农户存有瓜干或小杂粮。就是历年来不管丰歉都是半年糠菜半年粮的下港、麻塔等山区，今春也没动树头菜。
    就在这样大踏步胜利前进中，今年春季农村也出现了一些问题。这些问题集中的表现在粮食问题上。有些人因为目前还不能满足其吃细吃好的要求，或者不能搞粮食副业，因而叫喊粮紧；有些暂时减少收入的富裕农民、或对社的某些工作有意见的农民，也叫喊粮紧，因此形成普遍的“不缺报缺，缺少报多，晚缺早报、事先挂号”的现象。这种情况，一直延续到今年夏季的粮食征购工作中来。在粮食分配工作中，国家提出“统筹兼顾、全面安排”，兼顾国家、社和社员的三方面的利益，而某些农业社却不顾国家，只顾自己，有的则采取了先私后公，老秤分、市秤算，只算整场、不算末场，匿报产量，提高折干率，多留种子、饲料等办法，对抗国家统购政策。因此我们县的统购任务，一度大坠。在干部群众的思想方面，自贯彻毛主席“正确处理人民内部矛盾”的指示后，农村干部百分之百的参加了实际生产，强迫命令作风大为减少，违法乱纪的事件几乎绝迹，“只准动文，不准动武”的精神，已见诸广大干部的实际行动，许多同志表现了“打不还手，骂不还口”虚怀若谷、任劳任怨的高贵品质。但是由于对毛主席的指示，向农村党员、干部和农民群众宣传贯彻不够，加上最近少数右派分子，煽起了一阵反对党反对社会主义的台风，农村的某些地主、富农、反革命分子，趁机煽惑群众，企图把社会主义制度摧垮；有些农民看不明白他们的阴谋，受了欺骗，思想上落后面有所发展。在这种情况下，农村的党员、干部和广大的贫农及新老下中农，一方面要求领导给他们撑腰，一方面因为缺乏思想武装，对于许多谬论不能理直气壮地予以反驳。这给夏季生产、分配和粮食征购工作造成很大影响。
    问题的性质和解决途径
    上述问题是些什么性质的问题呢？在大规模的阶级斗争已经基本上结束，两条道路的斗争已经从制度上取得了基本胜利的今天，在农村人民内部的矛盾已经上升到主要的地位。在农村，矛盾的方面虽然很多，但是基本的矛盾乃是生产的增长速度赶不上人民生活的需要和资本主义思想和小生产者、小私有者的观念与社会主义制度不相适应的矛盾。这些矛盾不能不通过分配、供求、干部和群众的关系表现出来。有些人尚不满足吃粗吃饱，而超越现实的要求吃细吃好，他们从这样的要求出发，不顾国家利益，冷漠地对待国家的工业化，要求国家少购多销粮食；有些人还缺乏集体生产的习惯，说合作化好是好，就是制度受不了。他们要求基层干部，应付上级随合他们。当干部不能按照他们的意愿办事时，他们就不满意，发牢骚，又吵又闹。
    客观上的实际情况如此，但是从主观上说，矛盾的主导方面，还在于领导。领导上的官僚主义、主观主义不了解群众的实际要求，作风不太民主等等，在实际工作中造成了许多缺点。尤其重要的是近一年多以来，放弃了对农民的政治思想教育工作。许多农民在社会大变动中，立场不明，是非不清。他们对国家建设的好坏，不像抗日战争、解放战争那样感到和自己的生命财产密切相关，而我们又没有及时的提醒他们，激发其阶级情感，提高其社会主义觉悟，使他们正确地认识到国家建设和人民生活，生产、积累和消费，工业和农业，长远利益和现实利益等方面的关系。因此上述的矛盾，就不能不日益明显的表露出来，这自然是无足为怪的了。我们认为解决这些矛盾的最好的途径，除了领导广大农民增产节约，艰苦奋斗，力求在相当长的时间内，改变落后的农业国为先进的工业国之外，当前加强对农村的政治思想工作，是解决和缓和这些矛盾的灵丹妙药。
    我们的尝试
    鉴于上述情况，并根据省委关于加强对基层进行阶级教育的紧急通知，我们自6月下旬以来，即开展了对农村干部和广大群众的阶级教育运动。我们本着教育者必须先受教育的精神，先后召开了两次县委扩大（区委书记参加）会议。首先从思想上武装了县、区的领导骨干。接着书记、委员又下乡辅导，并由县委副书记陈超和县委宣传部副部长郭玉泉等带领八名干部，在山口区进行了试点工作。然后，运用试点的经验，指导全县开展了这一运动。从全县一般情况看，在内容上，多是以阶级教育为主，适当的揭露右派分子的反动言论，通过合作化的优越性和社会主义的前途教育，有力地反击了右派分子反对党的领导，反对社会主义的言行。同时进行正确处理人民内部矛盾的教育，强调团结一致，建设社会主义，号召农民以作好当前工作的实际行动，反击右派分子的反动言行。在方法上，仍然运用了从上到下，从党内到党外，回忆过去，对比现在，瞻望将来，通过现身说法，加深教育效果的经验。在进行上述教育时，并强调了因人制宜、灵活运用。目前，凡是这样作了的乡、村，社会主义空气蒸蒸日上，各项工作的面貌焕然一新。
    首先，基层干部有70％到80％的已由消极退缩，变得积极肯干，勇往直前。山口乡的太平社，原来有二十三名组长、队长以上的干部，消极动摇想辞职，经过阶级教育，有二十人积极起来。队长王金明说：“解放前给地主抗活，一年穷三百六十天，养不起家口，老婆一年讨八个月的饭。土改后翻了身，现在一个孩子当了国家干部，两个孩子上小学，咱不干谁干！”张家户永建社的十八名干部，想起了旧社会时本村流行的一段歌谣：“张家户，靠西河，穷人给地主去抗活，糠煎饼一罗罗，红咸菜一挪挪，大葱煎饼见不着，吃不饱还得多干活，心里的痛苦对谁说！”这一段歌谣激发了他们的阶级情感，他们说：“共产党来了翻了身，合作化挖掉了穷根，谁反对共产党，反对社会主义，我们就和他拼到底！”并决心办好社，搞好生产，保卫社会主义。
    其次，在广大群众中，社会主义思想也空前提高。尤其是贫农和下中农，更是欢欣鼓舞，理直气壮。范镇区姚庄乡，在贯彻阶级教育时，许多贫农当场站起来说：“贯彻总路线，实现合作化时，贫农直了直腰。可是合作化后，有些人光挑刺，说这也不好那也不好，弄得我们没直起腰来，这回可直直腰啦！”原来闹过事的粥店村的群众说：“过去的伪保长打我们，骂我们，现在的干部领导我们生产过好日子，谁再无事生非，是不讲良心。”粥店区马头村的一个军属，曾打过干部、鼓动退社，受到教育后，自动找干部检讨道歉。该区民丰二社社员们，受到教育后，揭发了鼓动他们停止生产的反革命分子顾贵真。总之，在农村，社会主义空气大大上升，落后言论大为减少。反社会主义言论，受到了广大群众的揭发和抨击。
    再次，阶级教育成了推动当前工作的巨大动力。社员劳动出勤率有了显著的提高。争取秋季丰收成为广大群众的自觉行动。姚庄乡燎原中心社，经过阶级教育后，为弥补化肥的不足，挖掘了十七种肥源。春季减产的第三生产队的秋季作物，每亩施到七车半肥料还有剩余。这个乡共一千四百多户，7月初的一天，光锄头即出动了两千六百多张。全县的统购任务，已经由下坠时的一千一百万斤上升到一千五百多万斤。我们对农村的政治思想教育工作，还仅是开始，还必须进一步的深入，只要我们经常地坚持作好思想工作，我们就能够把各项工作，作得有声有色。
