    The Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers held an enlarged symposium today from the afternoon until late at night. Participants included central committee members of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers in Beijing, members of the Beijing Municipal Committee, responsible persons from various regions attending the National People's Congress, members of the CPPCC, as well as cadres and grassroots leaders from the central and municipal committees of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, totaling over 200 people.
    The symposium was initially chaired by Huang Qixiang, but due to dissatisfaction with him among those present, it was later co-chaired by Ji Fang and Xu Binu, members of the Central Executive Bureau.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Zhang Bojun first confessed his reactionary words and deeds. Because his initial confession was vague, it aroused extreme indignation among those present. Under repeated questioning, Zhang Bojun confessed to some facts.
    When he talked about the activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance in the CPPCC Cultural Club, someone asked: "Did you want to turn the Cultural Club into a Petőfi Club?" Zhang Bojun replied: "If it hadn't been overthrown today, it might have become a Petőfi Club."
    When people asked him to confess further, Zhang Bojun said: "Let Luo Longji confess; he knows more clearly than I do."
    During Zhang Bojun's speech, Hu Yihe, a cadre of the central organ of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, questioned him about why he used the opportunity to help the Chinese Communist Party's rectification campaign to organize four committees in the China Democratic League, have the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers hold more than 20 symposiums in six aspects, and allow reporters from Guangming Daily to stir up trouble in nine major cities. What exactly was he up to?
    Zhang Bojun glanced at Li Boqiu, who was sitting on the stage, and then talked about the conspiracies of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers in Beijing.
    Someone also pointed out that the relationship between Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu was one of mutual protection.
    At this time, Li Boqiu interrupted to speak, trying to shift the focus of the struggle to Zhang Bojun's confidants, Wang Zhenxin and Zhang Shenfu. Everyone clearly saw their political trick and continued to question Zhang Bojun: Who executed your plan of stirring up trouble everywhere in Beijing? Zhang Bojun then said it was "Li Boqiu."
    Then, Hu Yihe further revealed that Zhang Bojun had Li Boqiu stir up trouble everywhere, and the price for Li Boqiu was to recommend him as the vice mayor of Beijing.
    At the symposium, everyone was extremely indignant at Li Boqiu's attempt to defend himself.
    Shan Ke of the Beijing Municipal Committee proposed that the Zhang-Luo alliance should confess to the China Democratic League, and in the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, they should confess whether there was a small group, and Zhang Bojun and Huang Qixiang should confess their relationship with the special agent and criminal Yang Hu. He also proposed reorganizing the special task force to examine Zhang Bojun and removing Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Wang Yifan, and Yang Yitang from it.
    During the symposium, Huang Qixiang actually used his position as chairman to stop the masses from speaking and lost his temper, which aroused everyone's anger, and his ugly history was revealed. Qiu Yuexi pointed out that Huang Qixiang had served as Chiang Kai-shek's military representative in Germany. When he passed through Shanghai, Zhang Bojun said that he was very eager for an official position and had asked him to join the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, but he refused. Later, in 1948, Chiang Kai-shek summoned Huang Qixiang back, and when Huang passed through Hong Kong, he still refused. As a result, when he returned to Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek ignored him. Only then did he fall into destitution in Hong Kong and suddenly become the Secretary-General of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers. At that time, everyone was very dissatisfied. From this, it can be seen that Zhang Bojun and Huang Qixiang had a historical connection long ago.
    Regarding Zhang Bojun's reactionary activities, Qiu Yuexi said that Huang Qixiang and Li Boqiu both knew about it; they were fellow travelers; if they didn't confess, who would? Someone also proposed that Zhang Bojun should confess to the reactionary activities with the responsible persons of the local organizations of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, such as Li Shihao echoing Zhang Bojun from north to south, and it must be clearly confessed.
    The afternoon session adjourned at six o'clock, and the evening session began at seven fifty-five. Ji Fang, a member of the Central Executive Bureau and Deputy Secretary-General of the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, stepped onto the podium and announced: The presidium of the conference has accepted everyone's opinions, and the original inspection team has been disbanded; the conference chairman will be assumed by Ji Fang and Xu Binu. At this time, the venue resounded with prolonged applause.
    Ji Fang spoke first, saying: Today is a great meeting for us to wage the most resolute struggle against the rightists under the attention of the people of the whole country! It is a meeting to thoroughly reverse the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers from questionable trends, and it is a meeting for us to firmly maintain the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and adhere to the socialist road! Zhang Bojun's conspiracy is vicious, and he is a venomous snake with protective coloring. He has always wanted to use the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers as his personal political capital. He was dictatorial in the Party, consistently excluding dissidents, attacking and slandering progressive elements who leaned towards the Communist Party, and attacking Communist Party members. He tried his best to recruit backward elements into the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers to be his confidants. Zhang Bojun used the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers as a tool to frantically attack the Communist Party and socialism. This is the greatest insult to all our comrades! It is the greatest political deception of all our comrades! Comrades, take resolute action, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to completely defeat the attack of the rightists, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory.
    Wan Xian wanted Zhang Bojun to confess to the alliance of offense and defense within the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers.
    After this, the conference focused on questioning Zhang Bojun's relationship with Yang Hu, as well as the alliance and conspiracy activities within the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers. Zhang Bojun spoke vaguely, which aroused extreme dissatisfaction among many people.
    Xu Binu immediately used undeniable facts to expose Zhang Bojun's dishonest attitude. He said that Zhang Bojun was the person in charge of two democratic parties and one newspaper. He organized four committees in the China Democratic League, and the scope of research included various important aspects of our national system. In Guangming Daily, 36 reporters were sent to nine major cities to stir up trouble everywhere, attempting to disrupt the Communist Party's rectification movement. At the same time, he also controlled Wenhui Daily through Luo Longji. The two newspapers echoed each other, from north to south. In the Democratic League of Chinese Peasants and Workers, 21 symposiums in six aspects were arranged; Wang Yifan, Yang Yitang, Zhang Yunchuan, Li Boqiu and others were sent out to develop the organization, and the scope of activities included many regions such as Northeast China, Henan, Shandong, and Beijing; in the development of the organization, some old intellectuals were recruited, as well as a group of old soldiers who had been subjected to reform through labor and control. At the same time, the connection with Yang Hu was strengthened. These activities are not accidental, nor are they isolated, but a comprehensive attack. Therefore, Zhang Bojun's connection with some old intellectuals, as well as with Yang Hu and other old soldiers, cannot but make people suspect that he intended to do something after he lit the fire. Zhang Bojun used his legal status to carry out illegal activities, and the intention is very clear.
    When the symposium adjourned at ten fifty, everyone shouted slogans, expressing their common determination to struggle.

    农工民主党座谈会上
    猛攻右派集团攻守同盟
    本报3日讯　今天的农工民主党中央执行局召开的扩大座谈会从下午进行到深夜。参加的人有在北京的农工党中央委员、北京市委会委员、出席全国人民代表大会的各地负责人、政协委员，以及农工民主党中央和市委机关干部和基层负责人共二百余人。
    座谈会开始原由黄琪翔主持，后来由于到会的人对他不满，改由中央执行局委员季方和徐彬如主持。
    会议开始时，首先由章伯钧交代他的反动言行和事实。由于他开始交代时含糊其词，引起了到会的人极端激愤。在纷纷的质问之下，章伯钧才交代了一些事实。
    在他谈到章罗联盟在政协文化俱乐部的活动时，有人问：“是不是想把文化俱乐部变成裴多菲俱乐部？”章伯钧回答：“今天要不是打下来，可能变成裴多菲俱乐部。”
    当人们要他进一步交代时，章伯钧说：“还是叫罗隆基交代吧，他比我清楚。”
    在章伯钧发言的过程中，农工民主党中央机关的干部胡一禾质问他为什么利用帮助中共整风的机会，在民盟组织四个委员会，让农工党北京市委在六个方面召开二十多个座谈会，又让光明日报的记者在九大城市到处点火，究竟搞什么鬼名堂。
    章伯钧向坐在台上的李伯球瞟了一眼，接着就谈到了农工党在北京的阴谋活动。
    又有人指出，章伯钧同李伯球等的关系，是互相包庇。
    这时李伯球插进来发言，想把斗争的锋芒转移到章伯钧的亲信王枕心和张申府身上，大家已经明显的看出他们的政治把戏，继续追问章伯钧：你在北京到处点火，谁来执行？章伯钧才说是“李伯球”。
    接着胡一禾又揭发章伯钧让李伯球到处点火，给李伯球的代价，是要推荐李伯球做北京市的副市长。
    在座谈会上，大家对李伯球为自己声明非常激愤。
  北京市委会的闪克提出，章罗联盟应到民盟去交代，在农工民主党应交代有无小集团，并要章伯钧和黄琪翔交代和特务罪犯杨虎的关系。他还提议改组检查章伯钧的专案小组，把黄琪翔、李伯球、王一帆、杨逸棠撤出来。
    在座谈会过程中，黄琪翔竟利用主席的身份制止群众发言，并大发脾气，引起了大家的愤怒，并且揭发了他的丑恶的历史。仇岳希指出，黄琪翔给蒋介石作过驻德国的军事代表，路过上海时，章伯钧说他官瘾很大，曾让他参加农工党，他不干。后来在1948年蒋介石把黄琪翔召回来，黄路过香港时，还是不干。结果回到南京，蒋介石不理他了。他才又落魄到香港，一跃而为农工党的秘书长。当时大家都很不满。从此可以看出章伯钧和黄琪翔早已有历史姻缘。
    关于章伯钧的反动活动，仇岳希说，黄琪翔和李伯球都知道，他们是同路人；他们还不交代，让谁交代？有人还提出要章伯钧交代跟农工民主党地方组织负责人的反动活动，如李士豪和章伯钧南北呼应，一定要交代清楚。
    下午的会议在六时休会，晚间的会议在七时五十五分开始。农工民主党中央执行局委员、副秘书长季方走上主席台宣布：大会主席团接受大家的意见，原有的检查小组解散；会议主席改由季方、徐彬如二人担任。这时会场响起了长时间的掌声。
    季方首先发言，他说：今天是我们在全国人民的注视中向右派分子作最坚决斗争的大
  会！是要彻底把农工民主党从可疑的动向中扭转过来的大会，是我们坚持维护中国共产党的领导和坚持走社会主义道路的大会！章伯钧的阴谋是毒辣的，他是一条带有保护色的毒蛇。他一贯想把农工党做为他个人的政治资本。他在党内专横独断，一贯排除异己，打击、诬蔑靠拢共产党的进步分子，打击共产党员。他尽量搜罗落后分子到农工党内来，作他的心腹。章伯钧把农工党作为向共产党、向社会主义猖狂进攻的工具，这是我们全党同志的最大的侮辱！是对我们全党同志的最大的政治欺骗！同志们，坚决行动起来，在中国共产党的领导下，彻底打垮右派分子的进攻，不得到彻底胜利，决不罢休。
    万贤要章伯钧交代农工民主党内部的攻守同盟。
    这以后，大会集中地追问了章伯钧同杨虎的关系，以及在农工民主党内的联盟和阴谋活动。章伯钧含糊其词，引起了很多人极度的不满。
    徐彬如立即用无可抵赖的事实揭露章伯钧不老实的态度。他说，章伯钧是两个民主党派和一个报纸的负责人。他在民盟组织了四个委员会，研究的范围包括了我们国家体制等各个重要方面。在光明日报，向九大城市派出了三十六名记者，处处点火，企图搞乱共产党的整风运动，同时，还通过罗隆基掌握了文汇报，两个报，互相唱和，南北呼应。在农工民主党，布置了六个方面的二十一个座谈会；派王一帆、杨逸棠、张云川、李伯球等人四出发展组织，活动范围包括东北、河南、山东、北京等很多地区；在发展组织中，搜罗了一些旧知识分子，还搜罗了一批被劳改、管制过的旧军人。同时还加强了同杨虎的联系。这些活动不是偶然的，也不是孤立的，而是全面的进攻。因此，章伯钧同一些旧知识分子，以及同杨虎和其他一些旧军人的联系，使人不能不怀疑，是想在他把火点起来以后，有所企图的。章伯钧利用他的合法地位，进行非法活动，企图是很明白的。
    十时五十分座谈会休会时，大家高呼口号，表示了共同的斗争决心。
