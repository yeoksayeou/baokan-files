Since the Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance of the China Democratic League felt very excited, believing that the democratic parties had a great future. In order to enable the Democratic League to play a supervisory role, and for the "long live" foundation of long-term coexistence, they planned to massively develop League members, strengthen the political power of the Democratic League, so as to "counter the organization with an organization". The targets of their membership development were intellectuals and young students. They wanted to包 (bao - wrap up) the intellectuals, not allowing the Party to develop Party members among the intellectuals. They wanted to organize a "intellectuals' party" of millions of people in order to fight for leadership from the Communist Party.

The publication of "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" was the first shot of the right-wing elements' attack on the Party.

In order to 包 (bao - wrap up) the intellectuals, the Zhang-Luo alliance first had to do propaganda work among the intellectuals in order to win them over. Therefore, the two meetings of the Democratic League encouraged Fei Xiaotong to "speak for the intellectuals". Fei Xiaotong accepted this task and wrote the article "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" (hereinafter referred to as "Early Spring Weather") (see Fei Xiaotong's "Before and After Early Spring"). It is said that the first draft of Fei Xiaotong's article was distributed to several of his League member comrades for "research and suggestions" and was repeatedly revised before being published. Therefore, this article is not Fei Xiaotong's personal lyrical work, but a propaganda document of the Zhang-Luo alliance, which we should pay attention to.

Fei Xiaotong said that his article "is still something like miscellaneous essays." This is indeed a "miscellaneous" essay, the content is contradictory, the central idea is not prominent, and it sings all the opposite tunes. There are two points worth mentioning in the article. First, he talked about the contention of a hundred schools of thought. He believed that after ideological remolding, the intellectuals had passed the "standpoint" stage, and what remained were the issues of viewpoints and methods. He did not clearly state what class the standpoint he was talking about was. But separating class standpoint from world view is puzzling. As a sociologist, Fei Xiaotong, having his own class standpoint, does not have the world view of that class, and even says "can't figure out what is materialistic and what is idealistic". This is hard to believe. Second, Fei Xiaotong believes that the lack of fluctuations among senior intellectuals in China due to the Polish and Hungarian events is "good on the one hand," but at the same time, he believes that this is a manifestation of the passive factors of senior intellectuals in China. He seemed to regret: Senior intellectuals in China did not stage a Hungarian incident in China like the intellectuals of the Petőfi Club. Otherwise, why did he criticize senior intellectuals in China for "not thinking deeply, the ancient well has not rippled"? Fei Xiaotong's speculation is obviously a big mistake. The vast majority of intellectuals in China, under the leadership of the Party, are playing a huge active role, working hard to build socialism, and they are diametrically opposed to those right-wing elements and counter-revolutionaries. The social conditions in China also have no possibility of staging a Hungarian incident. Fei Xiaotong's criticism can be said to be a slander against the vast number of intellectuals in China.

"Early Spring Weather" still has a central idea, its central idea focuses on showing that from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to March 1957, it was a severe winter for intellectuals. It seems to say that during this period, intellectuals in China lived a "miserable" life, and finally looked forward to the "slightly warm" early spring weather. This is completely singing the opposite tune. We all know very clearly that since the liberation of the whole country, it has been a bright spring for intellectuals, and now it is already an "extraordinary spring". Fei Xiaotong's malicious propaganda is motivated by ulterior motives. Premier Zhou Enlai said in the "Government Work Report" that without the five major movements, the three major transformations could not be realized. The ideological remolding of intellectuals is one of the five major movements, and the results are very significant. As long as people take off their black glasses, they can see that 5 million intellectuals inside and outside the Party (except for right-wing intellectuals) are scattered in factories, mines, enterprises, organs, troops, schools, and other work posts, and are actively contributing their strength to the socialist cause. Their progress is very significant. They approve of the socialist system. They are working hard to learn Marxism, and some people have become communists. Just talking about the intellectuals in schools, the vast majority of people are actively completing their teaching tasks and carrying out scientific research work. They have already trained millions of high-level and intermediate-level construction cadres for the motherland. Their achievements are great, and their enthusiasm is very high, and they certainly do not have the feeling of "slightly warm," vulnerable as the right-wing elements do.

Fei Xiaotong's "Early Spring Weather" does not conform to the mood of the vast majority of intellectuals, but only expresses the mood of "some old friends who teach in universities that he is familiar with". Who are Fei Xiaotong's old friends, and what is their mood? Pan Dawei said at an enlarged symposium of the Central Small Group of the Democratic League that Luo Longji has an invisible small organization, about ten people, and Fei Xiaotong is also in it. He also said: "These people are all dissatisfied with the arrangements for work and status after liberation." When Fei Xiaotong himself exposed Luo Longji's right-wing face, he also said: "Luo Longji believes that 'decent' intellectuals are those who retain bourgeois ideas, and all those who are progressive are called 'dogmatists'... Luo Longji hates progressive elements the most, thinking that they are people who 'watch the wind, look at the climate, put hats on people, and give cold punches'. He believes that those with backward ideas are capable. He wants them: 'Don't underestimate your past work and achievements', don't 'belittle yourself', and wants them to 'rely on their own abilities and show their talents'. ""Their policy is: unite the backward, win over the middle, and attack the progressive." Luo Longji's right-wing face is like this, while Fei Xiaotong admits that "some of his thoughts are consistent with Luo Longji." In this way, we can know that "Early Spring Weather" only tells the mood of these people: their status after liberation is not so particularly high, the Party does not pay special attention to them, and thus they harbor dissatisfaction with the Party; they verbally support the Party and socialism, but in their hearts they are anti-Party and anti-socialist. They are all two-faced people.

Fei Xiaotong revealed his motives for writing "Early Spring Weather" in "Before and After Early Spring". He believes that "contention of a hundred schools of thought" opened the first "lid", "the internal contradictions existing between the Party and the intellectuals are prominent." The Party is still exerting pressure on those intellectuals, so he advocates "mutual supervision" to uncover the "second lid". He said: "I advocate揭 (jie - uncover) the lid, because the lid will always be uncovered, it is better to uncover it sooner than later, better to uncover it big than small, uncovering it is better than冲开 (chongkai - smash open)." The meaning of these words is: if the Party does not pay special attention to these right-wing intellectuals and particularly raise their status, they will "smash open" the lid and boldly oppose the Party and socialism. This is Fei Xiaotong's motive for writing "Early Spring Weather".

We can say that the publication of "Early Spring Weather" was the first shot of the right-wing intellectuals' attack on the Party; the publication of "Before and After Early Spring" is already the so-called "spring blossoms" season, and poisonous weeds are also growing.

The Five-Act Play of Right-Wing Elements Opposing the Party and Socialism

The Communist Party of China announced the rectification campaign, and the Party welcomed people outside the Party to offer more opinions to help the Party do a good job in the rectification movement. At this time, Fei Xiaotong expected that the "second lid" to be揭 (jie - uncovered) by "mutual supervision" was finally uncovered, and believed that the "enthusiasm of intellectuals (right-wing intellectuals - translator) for politics" should be "developed", and believed that they would "change the past passive mood of not caring much about national affairs", to speak out freely, and attack the basic system of the country. The Zhang-Luo alliance believed that the time had come, and prepared to openly lay out the long-accumulated political conspiracy to the Communist Party. They made many arrangements to create a situation of great chaos in the world. On the one hand, they授 (shou -授 give, impart) ten "instructions" to right-wing elements of the Democratic League in various places, requiring League members to "boldly鳴 (ming - speak out freely), take the lead in争 (zheng - contend), and点火 (dianhuo - ignite fires) everywhere". Right-wing League members in various places did as they were told. Ma Zhemin, chairman of the Hubei Democratic League, did a great job. He demanded that the Democratic League take the initiative in the rectification, give play to its independence, and rush ahead of the Communist Party, to adopt the "壓 (ya -press) from above" and "攻 (gong - attack) from inside and outside" pincer tactics, to play a leading role, to go it alone, and set up its own rectification office. On the other hand, the Guangming Daily and the Wenhui Daily sent reporters to major cities to contact senior intellectuals they wanted to contact and intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the Party, organized symposiums, and produced hundreds of thousands of words of symposium records, rendering some malicious and destructive remarks, and prominently "revealing" them. In this way, right-wing League members "点火 (dianhuo - ignite fires) everywhere", saying bad things about the Party; the Guangming Daily and the Wenhui Daily tried their best to publish destructive reports, and what people saw and heard were all news of slander and abuse of the Party. At the same time, the Zhang-Luo alliance openly laid out their cards to the Party at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department, and then some right-wing elements of the Minjian and the Minge also resonated with the Zhang-Luo alliance, singing the opposite tune. The attempt of these right-wing elements was to tear up the constitution they had once raised their hands to pass, and openly oppose the Party and socialism.

The movement of right-wing elements opposing the Party and socialism adopted the following five-act play. Their theory is revisionism or right-leaning opportunism. They regarded Marxism and the theories and policies of the Communist Party as dogmatism to be opposed.

The first act, exposing shortcomings and negating achievements. They said that the statement that "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are secondary" is dogmatism. They tried their best to expose shortcomings and obliterate achievements, trying to portray the Communist Party as pitch black, and turning the Party's absolute advantage into the Party's absolute disadvantage, saying that the Party is fascist, so that the Party would lose its prestige in front of the people of the whole country, so as to undermine the unity between the Party and the masses and undermine the unity of the people of the whole country.

The second act, opposing the leadership of the Party. They said: "The idea of 'the Party rules the world' is the ultimate source of all sectarian phenomena", and the Party is a "monk group" (Chu Anping); "The Communist Party is a combination of dogmatism and empiricism", "The source of the three major isms is the Party committee system" (Ma Zhemin); "Abolish the school Party committee system" and let the teachers of the democratic parties, who account for the majority, lead the school (Chen Mingshu, Zhang Bojun); "折党之角，批党之鳞 (zhedangzhijiao, pidangzhilin - 折 fold,批 criticize, 之 possessive particle, 角 horns, 鳞 scales) ". They advocated that the democratic parties organize a coalition government (Chu Anping), abolish the leadership of the Party, and let the democratic parties take turns in power.

The third act, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat. They said: "The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the People's Daily editorial are all dogmatism" (Ma Zhemin); "The dictatorship of the proletariat is the source of bureaucracy, sectarianism and subjectivism" (Chen Xingui); "It is best for the democratic parties to develop one or two million people and set up an upper house" (Zhang Bojun); "Establish a political design institute" (Zhang Bojun); establish a "rehabilitation committee" (Luo Longji). They wanted to engage in bourgeois democracy and abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The fourth act, opposing socialism. They said: "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism", "Capitalism has good and bad", "Fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income", "There is no essential difference between capitalists and workers", and all those who advocate that fixed interest is exploitation and that the bourgeoisie still has two sides are called dogmatists (Zhang Naiqi). "The public representatives should be withdrawn from the joint state-private enterprises and handed over to the private capitalists to run" (Dong Shaochen). They believed that capitalism is superior to socialism, and they advocated engaging in "good" capitalism, to restore capitalism in China.

The fifth act, undermining Sino-Soviet friendship. They said: "It is unreasonable for China to bear all the expenses of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea", "The loan from the Soviet Union to our country has not been repaid for more than ten years, and interest has to be paid", "When the Soviet Union liberated the Northeast, it dismantled some machines in the factory, whether it was compensated or not, and whether it was repaid or not" (Long Yun). Some people also said that Soviet experts helping China's construction is interfering in internal affairs. This is how they slandered the Soviet Union and undermined Sino-Soviet unity.

The above is the program of the right-wing leaders of several democratic parties against the Party and against socialism, which is obviously a violation of the constitution and shakes the foundation of the country.

The broad masses of the people are monitoring the rampant offensive posture of the right-wing leaders with angry eyes, but they are still patiently enduring it for the time being, letting them be rampant for a while longer. However, right-wing students in various regions were instigated by League members and started making trouble. The majority of middle-of-the-road students temporarily lost their direction and followed a few steps, but soon saw through the faces of the right-wing students and quickly turned back. At this time, the Zhang-Luo alliance believed that the fire had spread, the world was in great chaos, the Communist Party was about to end, and they were secretly planning to bargain with the Party to clean up the situation by themselves.

"Ming (speak out freely)" without "Zheng (contend)" means right and wrong are not clear.

Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme. This is the law of dialectics. Just as the rampant offensive of the right-wing elements reached its peak, the workers spoke, the peasants spoke, and the left-wing students spoke. Uprightness rises, and evil declines. Now, the struggle against right-wing elements in colleges and universities across the country is in full swing, and right-wing elements are isolated. The democratic parties have also announced rectification and rectification of right-wing elements. At a time when socialist construction has made brilliant achievements and the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the right-wing elements want to abolish the leadership of the Party, abolish socialism, and make China regress to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state. This is what the people of the whole country vow to oppose. Such a nationwide struggle against right-wing elements must be carried out firmly and thoroughly. Gentlemen of the right wing! You only have two paths: one is to honestly confess your political conspiracy and wholeheartedly support the Party and socialism, not just paying lip service; the other is to continue to resist to the end and cut yourself off from the people. Which way to go, you choose for yourselves!

Right-wing elements often say that the policy of "speaking out freely" is to "entice the enemy to go deep, gather them together and annihilate them." This is not right. Since they are the enemy, it is okay to entice and annihilate them. If they are not the enemy, why entice them? Some people also say, I have already said that "contention of a hundred schools of thought" is "probably a trap, collecting some ideological information, and when another movement comes, it can be rectified well" (see "Early Spring Weather"). This is also wrong. The article "Early Spring Weather" is clearly something that satirizes the Party's policy toward intellectuals and has no common language with the working people, but the People's Daily published it. This is not because the People's Daily's political sense of smell is not sensitive, but to implement the policy of speaking out freely. As for those who join the Zhang-Luo alliance, that is another matter. Some people say that " 放 (fang - let out)", " 收 (shou - take back)", and " 整 (zheng - rectify)" are three movements. Now, opposing right-wing elements is "收 (shou - take back)" and " 整 (zheng - rectify)". This is absurd. With " 放 (fang - let out)" and " 鸣 (ming -speak)", there must be contention. " 鸣 (ming -speak)" without " 争 (contend)" means right and wrong are not clear. With criticism, there must be counter-criticism. Counter-criticism is not " 收 (shou - take back)", but " 争 (contend)". The struggle against right-wing elements is " 整 (zheng - rectify)", and it is " 整 (zheng - rectify)" those who oppose the Party and oppose socialism. This struggle must be carried out to the end.

Intellectuals Must Continue to Strengthen Ideological Remolding

In the struggle against right-wing elements, we deeply feel that if intellectuals sincerely support the Party and socialism, they must continue to strengthen ideological remolding. We have already entered the socialist era, and bourgeois elements are carrying out ideological remolding to transform into self-reliant workers. Can bourgeois intellectuals not be remolded? In the new society, there will only be three types of people in the future, namely workers, peasants, and intellectuals. If intellectuals do not rely on workers and peasants and do not serve workers and peasants, they will not only accomplish nothing, but also have no way out. Is this not yet clear? In the final analysis, it is still a question of standpoint, that is, whether intellectuals truly stand on the standpoint of the working class. Fei Xiaotong said that after the ideological remolding, the standpoint problem has been solved. The standpoint he is talking about is the bourgeois standpoint, not the working class standpoint. This can be determined from his recent remarks. He now wants to draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, which is welcome. But how can the right-wing draw a clear line with the right-wing? If you say that he used to be due to "unstable standpoint" and "sentimentalism", this kind of defense cannot solve the problem. To transform from the bourgeois standpoint to the working class standpoint, one must go through a serious and arduous process of ideological struggle. It is definitely not something that can be transformed in a moment. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, and in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to remold themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian communist world outlook. The transformation of the world outlook is a fundamental transformation, and most intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation now. We hope that the intellectuals in our country will continue to move forward, and in the process of their work and study, gradually build up the communist world outlook, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, gradually integrate with the workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone retreat, there is no way out for retreat."

The purpose of the Party's "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" policy is to use the method of persuasion, the method of free debate, rather than the method of brutality, to carry out long-term, patient, and meticulous Marxist propaganda to intellectuals, and promote the rapid growth of science and art in our country under the guidance of Marxism. However, right-wing intellectuals distorted this policy, believing that Marxism is no longer the guiding ideology and can be criticized. Although they rarely openly oppose Marxism, they use revisionism, that is, right-leaning opportunism, to oppose true Marxism under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, as mentioned earlier. Such remarks by right-wing elements have had a very bad influence on students in colleges and universities across the country. Recently, there has been a tendency among students not to pay attention to political study, and they think that Marxism is not so popular anymore. It seems that there is no need to care about what politics, what the future of the motherland, and the ideals of mankind are. Especially those right-wing students call the political courses taught in schools dogmatism and the teachers of political courses dogmatists. They propagandize in schools that there is no need to study political courses, no need to listen to current affairs reports; there is no inevitable connection between academics and politics, Einstein is not a Marxist, and so on. However, right-wing students are still paying attention to international and domestic issues. They accumulate the views of revisionists on international and domestic issues bit by bit, combined with their own capitalist, landlord, or rich peasant family situations, and can actually come up with a set of anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. Singing the opposite tune in schools, and can also temporarily confuse some middle-of-the-road students to follow them. In this rectification movement, they quickly accepted the reactionary propaganda of the right-wing elements, and took the lead in launching an anti-Party and anti-socialist great outpouring frenzy in many colleges and universities. All this is the result of the propaganda of revisionism by right-wing elements among the democratic parties and senior intellectuals.

"Judging from the situation revealed by the recent rectification movement, we should especially strengthen ideological and political work in schools. First of all, school teachers are soul engineers who cultivate the next generation, and they should continue to carry out self-education and self-remolding on the basis of past ideological remolding, in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. Past ideological remolding of teachers has been successful, but this rectification movement proves that it is not easy for teachers to master the ideological weapon of the proletariat, to stand firm in the storms of class struggle, to distinguish right from wrong, and to guide students in the right direction. Therefore, they should continue to work hard, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, so that they have correct political views, strengthen their labor views, and gradually integrate with workers and peasants. Secondly, education departments at all levels and school teachers should strengthen ideological and political education for students in light of the students' ideological situation, and cultivate them into national construction talents who are loyal to the socialist cause, hardworking and simple, and who combine physical labor and mental labor. In the past, the textbooks and methods of political education had shortcomings of being divorced from reality, and experience should be summed up in the future and improved. In recent years, political teachers in schools have done a lot of work, and they should continue to work hard in the future to improve their level and exert greater strength." (Premier Zhou Enlai: Government Work Report)

＊　＊　＊

Fellow delegates: I have a suggestion: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China was unanimously passed by all of us standing up and raising our hands on September 25, 1954, and then promulgated. Now some right-wing elements dare to openly destroy our constitution. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. In order to support our constitution, we must fight those right-wing elements to the end!

    从右派的进攻看知识分子必须加强改造
    李达的发言
    自从共产党提出长期共存、互相监督，百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针以后，民盟章伯钧—罗隆基同盟感到非常兴奋，认为民主党派大有搞头了。他们为了使民盟发挥监督的作用，为了长期共存的“万岁”基业，就计划着要大量地发展盟员，加强民盟的政治势力，以便“以组织对组织”。他们发展盟员的对象是知识分子和青年学生。他们要把知识分子包下来，不让党在知识分子中发展党员。他们要组织几百万人的“知识分子党”，以便向共产党争取领导权。
    “知识分子的早春天气”的发表是右派分子向党进攻的第一炮
    章罗同盟为了要把知识分子包下来，首先就要向知识分子做宣传工作，以便拉拢他们。因此，“民盟的两次会鼓励”费孝通“为知识分子说说话”，费孝通接受了这个任务，就写出了“知识分子的早春天气”（以下简称“早春天气”）那篇文章（参看费孝通的“早春前后”）。据说，费孝通那篇文章初稿，曾经分送他的几位盟员同志“研究提意见”，反复修改之后然后发表的。所以这篇文章，不是费孝通个人的抒情之作，而是章罗同盟的一个宣传文件，我们应当予以重视。
    费孝通说他的这篇文章“还是杂文之类的东西”。这确是“杂”文，内容自相矛盾，中心思想不突出，唱的都是反调。文中有两点值得一提。其一，他谈到了百家争鸣。他认为知识分子经过思想改造，“立场”这一关已经过了，剩下来的是观点和方法的问题。他所说的立场是什么阶级的立场，没有明说。但把阶级立场和世界观割裂开来，却使人难解。作为一个社会学家的费孝通既然有了自己阶级的立场，却没有那一个阶级的世界观，甚至说“弄不清楚什么是唯物的，什么是唯心的那一套”，这是很难使人相信的。其二，费孝通对于我国高级知识分子没有因波匈事件引起波动，认为“一方面这是好的”，同时却又认为这是我国高级知识分子的消极因素的表现。他好像很惋惜：我国高级知识分子没有像裴多菲俱乐部的知识分子那样，在中国搞一次匈牙利事件。否则，他为什么批评我国高级知识分子“没有深刻地动过脑筋，古井没有生波”呢？费孝通这种推测，显然是大错而特错。我国知识分子的绝大多数，在党的领导下，都在发挥着巨大的积极性，为建设社会主义而努力奋斗着，他们和那些右派分子和反革命分子是截然相反的。我国的社会条件也决没有演出匈牙利事件的可能。费孝通那个批评，可说是对我国广大知识分子的一种污蔑。
    “早春天气”还是有一个中心思想的，它的中心思想着重表明：从一九四九年中华人民共和国成立到一九五七年三月为止，是知识分子的严冬天气。这好像是说，在这段期间内，我国知识分子过着“凄凄惨惨戚戚”的生活，好容易才盼到了“乍暖还寒”的早春天气。这完全是反调。我们都很清楚地知道，从全国解放之日起，已经是知识分子的明朗的春天，现在已经是“不平凡的春天”了。费孝通的恶意宣传是别有用心的。周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中说到五大运动与三大改造的关系，如果没有五大运动就不能实现三大改造。知识分子的思想改造是五大运动之一，成绩是很显著的。人们只要把黑色眼镜取下，就可以看到党内外五百万知识分子（右派知识分子除外）散布在工厂、矿山、企业、机关、部队、学校等工作岗位上，都积极地贡献出自己的力量为社会主义事业奋斗着。他们的进步是很显著的。他们赞成社会主义制度。他们正在努力学习着马克思主义，有一部分人已经成为共产主义者。单就学校里的知识分子说，绝大多数人都积极地完成着自己的教学任务，并进行着科学研究工作，他们已经为祖国培养出数以百万计的高级和中级的建设干部。他们的成绩是巨大的，他们的积极性是很高的，决不像右派分子那样有“乍暖还寒”，弱不禁风之感。
    费孝通的“早春天气”并不符合于绝大多数知识分子的心情，而只是表达他“所熟悉的一些在高等学校教书的老朋友们的心情”。费孝通的那些老朋友们是些什么人，他们的心情究竟怎样？潘大逵在民盟中央小组扩大座谈会上说，罗隆基有一个无形的小组织，大约有十人左右，费孝通也在其内。并说：“这些人都是解放后对工作和地位的安排不满意的。”费孝通自己揭露罗隆基的右派面目时，也说：“罗隆基认为‘正派’的知识分子是保留着资产阶级思想的那些人，凡是进步的都被称为‘教条主义者’，……罗隆基最讨厌进步分子，认为他们是‘观风色，看气候，扣帽子，打冷拳’的人物。他认为那些思想落后的人是有本事的。他要他们：‘不必低估自己以往的工作和成绩’，不要‘妄自菲薄’，要他们‘各凭本事，各显神通’。”“他们的方针是：团结落后，争取中间，打击进步。”罗隆基的右派面目如此，而费孝通则承认自己“有些思想和罗隆基是一致的”。这样，我们就可以知道，“早春天气”只道出了这一些人的心情：他们在解放后的地位不是那么特别的高，党对他们没有特别重视，因而对党心怀不满；他们口头上拥护党、拥护社会主义，而心坎里是反党反社会主义的。他们都是两面性的人物。
    费孝通在“早春前后”中吐露了他写“早春天气”的动机。他认为“百家争鸣”揭开了第一个“盖子”，“党和知识分子之间存在着的内部矛盾突出了”。党对那些知识分子还在施加压力，所以他主张要“互相监督”来揭“第二个盖子”。他说：“我是主张揭盖子的，因为盖子总是要揭的，迟揭不如早揭，小揭不如大揭，揭开了比冲开为妙。”这些话的意思就是：党若再不特别重视这些右派知识分子，特别提高他们的地位，他们就要“冲开”盖子，大胆地反党反社会主义了。这就是费孝通写“早春天气”的动机。
    我们可以说，“早春天气”的发表，是右派知识分子向党进攻的第一炮；“早春前后”的发表，已是所谓“春暖花开时节”，毒草也滋长起来了。
    右派分子反党反社会主义的五步曲
    中国共产党宣告整风了，党欢迎党外人士多提意见，帮助党搞好整风运动。这时候，费孝通期待着要“互相监督”来揭的“第二个盖子”终于揭开了，认为“知识分子（右派的——引者）对政治的积极性”要“发扬”了，认为他们就要“改变过去对国家大事不大关心的那种消极情绪”，要大鸣大放，向着国家的基本制度进攻了。章罗同盟认为时机已到，准备把积蓄已久的政治阴谋公开向共产党摊牌了。他们作了很多布置，要制造出天下大乱的局面。一方面，授给各地民盟右派分子十点“指示”，要盟员“大胆的鸣，带头的争，要到处点火”，各地的右派盟员都照着做了。湖北民盟主任委员马哲民干得很出色，他要求民盟在整风中争取主动，发挥独立性，抢在共产党的前面，要采取“上下压”、“内外攻”夹击战术，要起带头作用，要单干，并且搞起了自己的整风办公室。另一方面，由光明日报和文汇报派出记者分赴各大城市，联系他们所要联系的高级知识分子和对党不满的知识分子，组织座谈会，搞出了几十万字座谈记录，把一些恶意的、破坏性的言论加以渲染，突出地“揭露”出来。像这样，右派盟员“到处点火”，说党的坏话；光明日报和文汇报尽量登载破坏性的报道，人们所看到的和听到的尽是诋毁党和辱骂党的消息。同时，章罗同盟在统战部召开的座谈会上公开向党摊牌，接着民建和民革的一些右派分子也和章罗同盟共鸣，唱起反调来了。这些右派分子的企图，就是要撕毁他们曾经举手通过的宪法，公开反党反社会主义。
    右派分子反党反社会主义的运动，采取了下列的五步曲，他们的理论是修正主义或右倾机会主义，他们把马克思主义和共产党的理论和政策，一律当作教条主义来反掉。
    第一步，揭露缺点，否定成绩。他们把“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”的提法说成是教条主义。他们尽量揭露缺点，抹煞成绩，企图把共产党说成漆黑一团，把党的绝对优势说成是党的绝对劣势，说党是法西斯，使党在全国人民面前丧失威信，这样来破坏党群团结，破坏全国人民的团结。
    第二步，反对党的领导。他们说：“党天下”的思想问题是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源，党又是“和尚团体”（储安平）；“共产党是教条主义和经验主义的结合物”，“三大主义的根源是党委制”（马哲民）；“取消学校党委制”由占多数的民主党派教师来领导学校（陈铭枢、章伯钧）；“折党之角，批党之鳞”（杨玉清）。他们主张各民主党派组织联合政府（储安平），取消党的领导，由各民主党派轮流执政。
    第三步，反对无产阶级专政。他们说：“论无产阶级专政的历史经验和人民日报社论，都是教条主义”（马哲民）；“无产阶级专政是官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的根源”（陈新桂）；“民主党派最好发展一两百万人，搞个上议院”（章伯钧）；“设立政治设计院”（章伯钧）；设立“平反委员会”（罗隆基）。他们要搞资产阶级民主，取消无产阶级专政。
    第四步，反对社会主义。他们说：“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”，“资本主义有好有坏”，“定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获”，“资本家和工人没有本质上的区别”，把主张定息是剥削，主张资产阶级还有两面性的人一律称为教条主义者（章乃器）。“公私合营企业应撤出公方代表，交由私方资本家去经营”（董少臣）。他们认为资本主义比社会主义优越，他们主张搞“好”的资本主义，要使资本主义在中国复辟。
    第五步，破坏中苏友谊。他们说：“抗美援朝经费全部由中国负担，不合理”，“苏联对我国借款，十几年都还不清，还要付利息”，“苏联解放东北时，拆走了工厂中的一些机器，有无代价，偿还不偿还”（龙云）。还有人说苏联专家帮助我国建设是干涉内政。他们是这样地污蔑苏联、破坏中苏的团结的。
    以上是几个民主党派右派头子反党反社会主义的纲领，显然是违反宪法，动摇国本的。
    右派头子们的猖狂进攻的阵势，广大人民群众是用愤怒的眼光监视着他们的，但还暂时忍耐着，让他们再多多地猖狂一个时候。可是各地区右派学生受了盟员的煽动，胡闹起来了，多数中派学生暂时迷失方向，曾经跟着走了几步，但不久就识破右派学生的面貌，赶快回头了。正在这个时候，章罗同盟认为火势已经蔓延，天下已经大乱，共产党快要完蛋，他们在密室策划，准备向党讨价还价，由他们来收拾时局了。
    “鸣”而不“争”，则是非不明
    物极必反，这是辩证法的规律。正当右派分子猖狂进攻达到顶点的时候，工人说话了，农民说话了，左派学生说话了。正气上升，邪气下降了。现在，全国各高等学校反右派分子的斗争如火如荼地展开了，右派分子孤立了。各民主党派也都已宣布整风，整右派分子了。在社会主义建设取得辉煌成就、社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利的时候，右派分子却要取消党的领导，取消社会主义，使中国退回到半殖民地半封建的状态去，这是全国人民誓死反对的。像这样带全国性的反右派分子的斗争，必然要坚决彻底进行下去的。右派先生们！你们只有两条路：一条是：老老实实地坦白出你们的政治阴谋，死心蹋地的而不是口是心非的拥护党拥护社会主义；另一条是：继续顽抗到底，自绝于人民。何去何从，你们自己去选择吧！
    右派分子常说，鸣放政策是“诱敌深入，聚而歼之”。这话不对，既然是敌，诱歼可也，若果非敌，何诱之有。又有人说，我早已说过，百家争鸣，“怕是个圈套，搜集些思想情况，等又来个运动时可以好好整一整”（见“早春天气”）。这话也不对。“早春天气”一文，明明是讽刺党的知识分子政策的东西，和劳动人民没有共同语言，人民日报却给发表了。这并不是人民日报的政治嗅觉不灵，而是贯彻鸣放的方针。至于加入章罗同盟的人，那是又当别论了。又有人说，“放”、“收”、“整”是三部曲，现在反右派正是“收”和“整”。这话是荒谬的。有“放”有“鸣”，必然有争，“鸣”而不“争”，是非不明。有批评必有反批评，反批评并不是“收”，而是“争”。反右派的斗争是“整”，是“整”那些反党反社会主义的人们。这个斗争是要进行到底的。
    知识分子必须继续加强思想改造
    在反右派的斗争中，我们深切地感到，知识分子如果真心拥护党，拥护社会主义，就必须继续加强思想改造。我们已经进到社会主义时代，资产阶级分子正在进行着思想改造，要转变为自食其力的工人，难道资产阶级的知识分子可以不改造了么？在新社会中，将来只有三种人，即工人、农民和知识分子。知识分子如果不依靠工农，不为工农服务，不但一事无成，并且也决无出路，这难道还不明白么？说来说去，还是一个立场问题，即知识分子是否真正站在工人阶级立场的问题。费孝通所说经过思想改造一关，立场问题已经解决了。他所说的立场是资产阶级立场，不是工人阶级立场，这可以从他最近的言论里判明的。他现在要和右派分子划清界限了，这是值得欢迎的。但右派怎能和右派划清界限呢？若说，他过去由于“立场不稳”，由于“温情主义”，这种辩解是不能解决问题的。要从资产阶级立场转变到工人阶级立场，必须经过严重的、艰苦的思想斗争过程，决不是立谈之间可以转变过来的。毛泽东主席说：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”
    党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的目的，是用说服的方法，用自由辩论的方法，而不是用粗暴的方法，向知识分子进行长期的、耐心的、细致的马克思主义的宣传，促进我国的科学艺术在马克思主义的指导下迅速成长起来。可是右派知识分子歪曲了这个政策，认为马克思主义已不是指导思想，并且是可以批判的了。他们虽然很少公开反对马克思主义，却利用修正主义即右倾机会主义，在反对教条主义的口实下，来反对真正的马克思主义，这是前面已经说到的。右派分子这样的言论在全国高等学校的学生中起了极坏的影响。最近一个时期，学生中有一种不重视政治学习的倾向，他们认为马克思主义已不那么行时了。好像什么政治，什么祖国前途，人类的理想，都没有关心的必要。特别是那些右派学生，把学校所教的政治课都叫做教条主义，把政治课的教师叫做教条主义者。他们在学校中宣传政治课没有学习的必要，时事政治报告没有听取的必要；学术与政治没有必然的联系，爱因斯坦并不是马克思主义者，等等。可是右派学生们却还是留心国际问题和国内问题的，他们把修正主义者对于国际和国内问题的看法，一点一滴积累起来，结合自己的资本家、地主或富农的家庭情况，居然也能搞出一套反党反社会主义的谬论来，在学校中高唱反调，并且也还能暂时地迷惑一些中派学生跟着他们走。在这次整风运动中，他们很快地接受了右派分子的反动宣传，在许多高等学校中带头搞起了反党反社会主义的大鸣大放的风潮。这一切都是民主党派和高级知识分子中的右派分子宣传修正主义的后果。
    “从最近整风运动暴露出来的情况看来，我们应该特别加强学校的思想政治工作。首先，学校教师是培养下一代的灵魂工程师，他们应该在过去思想改造的基础上，根据自愿的原则，继续进行自我教育和自我改造。过去教师的思想改造是有成绩的，但是这次整风运动证明，要使教师们掌握无产阶级的思想武器，能够在阶级斗争的风浪中站稳立场，明辨是非，引导学生朝着正确方向前进，是不容易的。因此，他们应该继续努力，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，使自己具备正确的政治观点，加强自己的劳动观点，逐步地同工农打成一片。其次，各级教育部门和学校教师要针对着学生的思想情况，加强对学生的思想政治教育，培养他们成为忠实于社会主义事业的、勤劳朴素的、体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的国家建设人才。政治教育的教材和方法，过去有脱离实际的缺点，今后应该总结经验，加以改进。几年来，学校的政治教师作了不少的工作，今后他们应该继续努力，提高自己的水平，发挥更大的力量。”（周恩来总理：政府工作报告）

    各位代表：我有一个建议：中华人民共和国宪法，是我们大家在一九五四年九月二十五日全体起立举手一致通过，然后颁布的。现在有些右派分子公然敢于破坏我们的宪法了，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。为了拥护我们的宪法，我们要和那些右派分子斗争到底！
