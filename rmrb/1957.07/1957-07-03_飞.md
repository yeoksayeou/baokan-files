    Flight
      ——Fly! Motherland. Fly! Brothers.
   (Written for the upsurge of the socialist revolution and the crushing of the right-wing offensive)
    Pick up and fly, fly, fly! Fly over the highest mountains, fly over the boundless ocean, fly over the edge of the sky where the sun rises, fly through the countless twinkling stars. Fly, fly, fly! Fly bravely, fly fiercely, like lightning piercing the sky, opening up a path in rapid flight. Fly, fly, fly! Fly bravely, fly fiercely, like sunlight driving away the lingering clouds, breaking through the universe and spraying brilliance. Fly, fly, fly! Fly bravely, fly fiercely, like the fiery flames of a volcanic eruption, swirling with wild and mighty force. Fly, fly, fly! Fly towards the goal! Fly towards the ideal pursued by mankind! Fly towards the beautiful world seen in dreams! Fly towards the goal of shedding blood and sacrifice to realize it! Towards, towards, towards, towards, towards... Fly towards the direction opened up by "October"! Fly towards the summit of socialism! Fly towards communism! Fly!!!

    飞
      ——飞呀！祖国。飞呀！弟兄。
   （为社会主义革命高潮及粉碎右派进攻而作）
    俯拾飞呀飞！飞呀飞！飞过最高的山峰，飞过无边的海洋，飞过太阳出来的天边，飞过无数眨着眼睛的星星间。飞呀飞！飞呀飞！勇敢地飞，猛烈地飞，像闪电穿过天际，在急激的飞行里开辟路轨。飞呀飞！飞呀飞！勇敢地飞，猛烈地飞，像阳光驱逐残云，冲破宇宙、喷射光辉。飞呀飞！飞呀飞！勇敢地飞，猛烈地飞，像火山爆发烈焰，卷着欢狂大力翻飞。飞呀飞！飞呀飞！向目的飞！向人类追求的理想飞！向梦里看见的美好世界飞！向为实现它而流血牺牲的目的飞！向着，向着，向着，向着，向着……向着“十月”开辟的方向飞！向着社会主义的绝顶飞！向共产主义飞！飞！！！
