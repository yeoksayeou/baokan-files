    Strengthen Sino-Japanese People's Friendship
    Jointly Strive to Defend Peace
    (I) Dear Editor:
    I know you are often busy with the publication of the newspaper, and I sincerely hope this letter will not cause you any trouble.
    I am writing this letter to express my desire for peace. I am a 29-year-old Japanese woman, and I have been striving to send appeals for peace to all countries of the world through every opportunity for communication.
    Since the end of World War II, most people in the world have advocated for peace. However, atomic bomb tests are still being conducted in some parts of the world, ignoring our desire for peace. I am sure that atomic bomb tests will bring disaster to mankind in the future.
    In Japan, we have many lovely poems describing rain, but now rain makes us worry. Because it is said that as a result of atomic bomb tests, rain contains a large amount of radioactive material. The continuous atomic bomb tests will bring huge disasters to all mankind, which is an undeniable fact. This has been confirmed by many scientists in the world. Therefore, we cannot just stop at signing petitions against atomic bomb tests; we should turn our desire for peace into practical action. The pain of being bombed by atomic bombs twice is still fresh in our memory, and we will never forget it.
    The Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from atomic bombs, recognize the importance of world peace and friendship between countries. We must not repeat the same mistakes, because we believe that the estrangement between countries is the real cause of any war. If we understand each other, there will be no war. We should realize that mutual understanding will bring peace and happiness to all countries.
    Establishing pure relationships between people is absolutely necessary, and I think this will generate new moral concepts based on human rights. To establish such a relationship, we should first give each other the opportunity to exchange views. I believe that frankly exchanging views will help deepen friendship and mutual understanding.
    We Japanese people sincerely desire peace. We want to do our best to establish a world full of friendship and immense happiness by frankly exchanging views with every country in the world. We believe that such a day will eventually come, when everyone in the world can live in a peaceful environment.

  (II) Dear Chinese friends:
    At the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, the Japanese Youth and Women's Delegation visited your country for seventy days. As a member of the delegation, I received a warm welcome from the Chinese people during this period, and I was given kind and sincere friendship from friends from all walks of life in China. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, the All-China Youth Federation, and friends from all walks of life.
    During my visit to your country, the deep friendship that the Chinese people showed us, the industriousness of the Chinese people, China's long history, culture and traditions, scenic spots and historical sites, and high mountains and great rivers, all left an indelible impression on me.
    I firmly and unswervingly believe that the Chinese people are looking forward to the economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, the restoration of diplomatic relations, and world peace. Removing the obstacles to economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan, removing the obstacles to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and all other obstacles, will depend on the strength of the people.
    I returned to Japan with the deep friendship of the Chinese people, and I want to convey this deep friendship of the Chinese people to all the Japanese people.
    I wish the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will continue to develop, and I am willing to do my part for this.

    (III) Dear Katsuhisa Yoshida:
    I saw your letter to Chinese youth in the People's Daily. I wanted to write to you earlier, but I don't understand Japanese, so I am writing to you now.
    I am a student in the second year of the Huanggang County Normal School in Hubei Province. Under the meticulous care of the leaders of the country and the school, we study and live happily, and we deeply feel the warmth of living in a collective family. I love literature and want to engage in children's literature creation in the future to complete the important task assigned to me by the motherland, to cultivate the flowers of the motherland. I am willing to cultivate my students to become supporters of world peace. I am very willing to be friends with Japanese youth. I hope we can correspond with each other in the future. In your next letter, please tell me about your work and study.
        I wish you
            Good health!
                        Jiashun Yang, Huanggang County Normal School, Hubei Province, China
    (IV) Dear friend – Katsuhisa Yoshida:
    I have wanted to communicate with Japanese youth for a long time, but I couldn't write to you earlier because I don't understand Japanese. I am very happy to see in your letter that you are learning Chinese. We can communicate in Chinese in the future.
    Japan is the first country in the world to suffer from atomic bombs, and we understand the important significance of the Japanese people's need for peace and friendship. Now the American and British imperialists still want to test hydrogen bombs in Nevada and Christmas Island. We call on the people of the world to unite and resolutely struggle against hydrogen bomb tests and to stop war.

    (V) Dear Japanese friend – Morio Hamada:
    I read your letter in the People's Daily, and I was so happy I almost jumped up – because I have added another Japanese youth friend.
    I work at the People's Bank of China and am a young philatelist. Whenever I open my stamp album to admire the stamps, I always repeatedly admire the various beautiful stamps I exchanged from friends in your country. From those patterns, you can see the beauty of the Japanese scenery and the activity of sports. When I saw a "Commemorative Stamp for Prohibiting Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" issued by your country, my heart could not calm down for a long time. I feel extremely indignant at the fact that American imperialism once used atomic bombs to kill ordinary residents of Japan. I firmly believe that the Japanese people will win in the struggle against atomic war and defending world peace. I am willing to communicate with Japanese youth friends and exchange stamps to deepen our friendship. Finally, let us join hands tightly and work hard to defend world peace and strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

### 加强中日人民友谊  共同努力保卫和平

    加强中日人民友谊
    共同努力保卫和平
    （一）亲爱的编辑：
    我知道你经常忙于报纸的出版工作，我真诚地希望这封信不致给你带来麻烦。
    我写这封信，是为了表示我的爱好和平的愿望。我是一个二十九岁的日本妇女，我一直努力通过每一次通信的机会，向世界各国发出和平的呼吁。
    第二次世界大战结束以来，世界上大多数人都主张和平。然而，原子弹试验仍不断地在世界某些地区进行，忽视了我们的和平的愿望。我敢肯定地说，原子弹试验将会在未来给人类带来灾祸。
    在我们日本，有许多描写雨的可爱的诗歌，但现在雨却使我们担心。因为，据说由于原子弹试验的结果，雨内含有大量放射性物质。继续不断的原子弹试验将会给全人类带来巨大的灾祸，是一个无可否认的事实。这已为世上许多科学家所证实。因此，我们不能再仅仅停留在反对原子弹试验的签名运动上，我们更应将和平的愿望化为实际行动。日本两次遭到原子弹轰炸的痛苦，对我们说来是记忆犹新的，我们永世不会忘记。
    深受原子弹痛苦的日本人民认识到世界和平和各国间友谊的重要性。我们不能重蹈复辙，因为我们相信国与国之间的隔阂是导致任何战争的真正原因。如果我们互相了解，就不会有战争。我们应该认识到，互相了解将会给各国带来和平与幸福。
    建立人与人之间的纯洁的关系是绝对必要的，我以为这将产生基于人权基础上的新的道德观念。为了建立这种关系，首先应使彼此有交换意见的机会。我相信，坦率地交换意见将有助于加深彼此的友谊和相互了解。
    我们日本人民衷心地愿望和平。我们想尽力通过与世界上每一国家坦率地交换意见，建立一个充满友谊和无比幸福的世界。我们相信这样的一天终会到来，那时世界上的每一个人能够生活在和平的环境中。

  （二）亲爱的中国朋友：
    应中华全国民主青年联合会的邀请，日本青年与妇女访华代表团在贵国进行了为期七十天的访问。我作为其中的一员，在这期间受到了中国人民的热烈欢迎，并得到了中国各界朋友们的亲切的诚恳的友情。为此对中国人民，对中华全国民主青年联合会和各界的朋友们致以衷心的谢意。
    我在贵国访问期间，中国人民对我们所表示的深厚的友谊，中国人民的勤劳、中国的悠久的文化及其传统、名胜古迹以及高山大河等等，所有这些都给我留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    我坚定不移地确信：中国人民是在盼望着日中两国的经济及文化的交流、邦交的恢复以及世界的和平。扫除中日两国经济及文化交流的障碍，扫除两国邦交恢复的障碍以及其他的一切障碍，这将依赖于人民的力量。
    我带着中国人民的深厚的友谊回到了日本，我想把中国人民对日本人民的这种深厚的友谊传达给全日本人民。
    祝中日两国人民的友谊日益发展，为此我也愿尽微力。
                  日本青年与妇女访华代表团团员　横田重信

    （三）亲爱的吉田胜久朋友：
    你给中国青年的来信，我在人民日报上看到了。我本想早日给你写信，但我不懂日文，所以迟到现在才给你去信。
    我是湖北省黄冈县师范学校二年级的学生，在国家和学校领导者的无微不至的关怀下，我们学习、生活都很愉快，我们深深感到生活在集体大家庭中的温暖。我酷爱文学，将来想从事儿童文学创作，来完成祖国交给我的重任，培养祖国的花朵。我愿培养我的学生成为世界和平的拥护者。我很愿意和日本青年做朋友，希望我们今后互相通信。下一次来信，请把你的工作和学习情况告诉我。
        祝你
            身体健康！
                        中国湖北省黄冈县师范学校　杨家顺
    （四）亲爱的朋友——吉田胜久：
    很久以前，我就想与日本青年通信，因我不懂日文，所以没能早日给你们去信。看到你的信中说，你正在学习中文，我很高兴，我们以后可以用中文通信了。
    日本是世界上第一个遭受原子弹的国家，我们很理解日本人民需要和平和友谊的重要的意义。现在美、英帝国主义者仍然要在内华达州、圣诞岛试验氢弹，我们呼吁全世界人民团结起来，为反对试验氢弹、阻止战争而坚决斗争。
                        中国江西省虔南县新华书店　黄淑明
    （五）亲爱的日本朋友——浜田守男：
    我在人民日报上读了你的来信，高兴得几乎跳了起来——因为我又增添了一位日本青年朋友。
    我在中国人民银行工作，是一个青年，集邮的爱好者。每当我翻开集邮册欣赏邮票时，我总要反复地欣赏我从贵国朋友那里交换来的各种美丽的邮票。从那些图案中，可以看出日本风景的优美、体育运动的活跃。当我看到贵国发行的一种“禁止原子弹、氢弹的纪念邮票”时，我内心很久不能平静。我对美帝国主义曾用原子弹杀害过日本普通居民的事实，感到极大的愤慨。我深信日本人民在反对原子战争、保卫世界和平的斗争中会获得胜利。我愿意和日本青年朋友互相通信、交换邮票来加深我们的友情。最后，让我们紧紧地携起手来，为保卫世界和平和加强中日两国人民友好而努力。
