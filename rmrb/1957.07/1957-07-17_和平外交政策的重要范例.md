    Important Example of Peaceful Diplomacy

    On July 9th, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, delivered a report on the Sino-Burmese border issue at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress. This report described the process of our government handling the Sino-Burmese border issue and explained the basic principles and policies followed by our government in handling this issue. The representatives attending the meeting discussed this issue, which is of concern to the people of the whole country, and passed a corresponding resolution, expressing their agreement with Premier Zhou Enlai's report. The representatives also pointed out that the Chinese government's consultation with the Burmese government on resolving the border issue between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is a positive step in promoting China's peaceful diplomatic policy and enhancing friendly relations with neighboring countries.

    The Sino-Burmese border issue is one of the unresolved boundary issues left over from history between our country and neighboring countries. In feudal times, although China and Burma had close relations, there was no very clear border. After Britain ruled Burma in 1885, it took advantage of this unclear border situation to create long-term disputes over the Sino-Burmese border issue, taking the opportunity to expand its colonial territory and occupy our country's territory. At that time, the Sino-Burmese border issue reflected the unequal relationship between imperialist countries and oppressed countries. At that time, this issue could not be resolved reasonably, and imperialist countries used this issue to provoke national sentiments between the Chinese and Burmese people. However, the current situation is completely different. China has become a socialist country, and Burma has also freed itself from colonial rule and become a nationalist independent country. China and Burma have established friendly relations on an equal basis and, together with India, have become initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In this way, a fundamental historical change has taken place in the relations between China and Burma. Under these new conditions, it has become the common aspiration of the Chinese and Burmese people to resolve some historical issues between the two countries through peaceful consultation and mutual respect. Therefore, the historical conditions for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue have matured.

    Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report that the position taken by our government in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue proceeds from safeguarding our national interests, while also proceeding from promoting Sino-Burmese friendship and the unity of Asian and African countries. In order to conscientiously implement this basic policy, our government has conducted systematic and detailed investigations and research on the historical data and actual situation related to the Sino-Burmese border issue. Because this issue has a long history and its historical background is very complex, it requires us to adopt a cautious attitude and study the issue comprehensively from various angles. We must not only conduct scientific analysis of historical data, but also pay attention to the current actual situation; we must not only pay attention to historical changes, but also treat past treaties related to the Sino-Burmese border in accordance with general international practice. We believe that if we only look at this complex issue from one isolated perspective, we may come to incorrect judgments, and only by combining all aspects of the situation for consideration can we come to a fair and reasonable conclusion.

    The principled suggestions put forward by our government regarding the three undecided sections of the border between China and Burma are a concrete manifestation of the basic policy and scientific attitude we follow. This principled suggestion adopts a realistic attitude towards historical facts, on the one hand, without obliterating historical facts, and on the other hand, opposing great-power chauvinistic tendencies of forced association, exaggeration, and distortion of historical facts. In this way, it not only safeguards our national interests, but also safeguards the friendship between China and Burma. And maintaining Sino-Burmese friendship is also in the interests of our people.

    The principled suggestions put forward by our government have brought the Sino-Burmese border issue, which has existed for seventy years, closer to a final solution. The resolution of this issue will promote friendship between China and Burma, and will also be conducive to the friendship and unity of Asian and African countries. For several years, imperialist forces have continuously used the Sino-Burmese border issue in an attempt to provoke relations between China and Burma and create an atmosphere of tension. They wanted to use this method to weaken the influence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and undermine the friendly relations between Asian and African countries in order to facilitate their aggressive activities. But the imperialists' conspiracy failed. Facts have shown that as long as we Asian and African countries adhere to unity and cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the problems between our Asian and African countries can be completely resolved reasonably through peaceful consultation. We believe that through the joint efforts of China and Burma, we will certainly be able to comprehensively and perfectly resolve this complex issue left over from history. Let us erect a new monument to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence on the Sino-Burmese border, let us write a new and exciting page in the history of Sino-Burmese relations and the history of Asian-African national relations, and let us continuously advance the cause of Sino-Burmese friendship and the unity and cooperation of Asian and African countries!

    和平外交政策的重要范例
    7月9日，我国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上，作了关于中缅边界问题的报告。这个报告叙述了我国政府处理中缅边界问题的经过，并说明了我国政府在处理这个问题中所遵循的基本原则和政策。出席这次会议的代表们就这个全国人民所关心的问题进行了讨论，并且通过了相应的决议，表示同意周恩来总理的报告。代表们并且指出，我国政府同缅甸政府根据和平共处五项原则商谈解决两国边界问题，是我国推行和平外交政策和增进同邻国的友好关系的一个积极步骤。
    中缅边界问题，是我国同邻国之间存在着的历史上遗留下来的未定界问题之一。在封建时代，中缅两国虽然关系密切，但并没有十分明确的疆界。1885年英国统治缅甸之后，就利用这种疆界不很明确的情况，在中缅边界问题上制造了长期的纠纷，借机扩大它的殖民领域，侵占我国的领土。在那时候，中缅边界问题反映了帝国主义国家同被压迫国家之间的不平等的关系。在那时候，这个问题不可能得到合理解决，而且帝国主义国家利用这个问题来挑拨中缅两国人民的民族感情。但是，现在的情况已经完全不同了。中国已经成为一个社会主义国家，缅甸也已摆脱了殖民统治，成为一个民族主义的独立国家。中缅两国在平等的基础上建立了友好关系，并且同印度一起，成为和平共处五项原则的倡议者。这样，中缅两国之间的关系就发生了历史性的根本变化。在这种新的条件下，用和平协商和互相尊重的精神，来解决两国之间存在的一些历史上的问题，就成了中缅两国人民的共同愿望。因此，公平合理解决中缅边界问题的历史条件已经成熟了。
    周恩来总理在报告中指出，我国政府在解决中缅边界问题上所采取的立场，是从维护我国民族利益出发的，同时也是从促进中缅友谊和亚非各国团结的利益出发的。为了认真地执行这个基本政策，我国政府对于有关中缅边界问题的历史资料和实际情况，曾进行了系统的详细的调查研究。由于这个问题由来已久，它的历史背景又十分复杂，这就需要我们采取慎重的态度，从各个角度来全面地研究这个问题。我们既要对历史资料进行科学的分析，又要注意到目前的实际情况；既要注意到历史的变化，又要按照一般国际惯例来对待过去签订的有关中缅边界的条约。我们认为，如果只从某一个孤立的角度来看待这个复杂的问题，那么就可能得出不正确的判断，而只有把各方面的情况都结合起来加以考虑，才会得出公平合理的结论。
    我国政府针对中缅两国之间三段未决边界提出的原则性建议，就是我们所遵循的基本政策和科学态度的具体表现。这个原则建议，在对待历史事实方面采取了实事求是的态度，一方面不抹煞历史事实，另一方面又反对牵强附会、夸张和歪曲历史事实的大国沙文主义倾向。这样就既维护了我国的民族利益，又维护了中缅两国的友谊。而维护中缅友谊，也是符合于我国人民的利益的。
    我国政府所提出的原则性建议，已经使存在了七十年之久的中缅边界问题接近于最后解决。这个问题的解决，将促进中缅两国之间的友谊，还将有利于亚非国家的友好和团结。几年以来，帝国主义势力不断利用中缅边界问题，力图挑拨中缅两国的关系，制造紧张空气。他们想用这种办法来削弱和平共处五项原则的影响，破坏亚非国家的友好关系，以便于他们进行侵略活动。但是帝国主义的阴谋落空了。事实表明，只要我们亚非国家坚持在和平共处的五项原则的基础上团结合作，我们亚非国家之间的问题是完全可以通过和平协商求得合理解决的。我们相信，通过中缅双方的共同努力，一定能够把这个历史上遗留下来的复杂问题加以全面的完满的解决。让我们在中缅边界上树起和平共处五项原则的新的纪念碑，让我们在中缅关系史和亚非国家关系史上写下新的令人兴奋的一页，让我们把中缅友谊和亚非国家的团结合作事业不断地向前推进！
