Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: Shanghai's shipyards are manufacturing a large number of tugboats, barges, freighters, and passenger-cargo ships for sailing on the Yangtze River.

This year, four pig transport barges will be manufactured, with three already having completed their hull construction and begun machinery installation. This is an interesting special-purpose vessel with four floors, capable of carrying more than 1,800 pigs at a time. The ship has special water troughs on both sides for the pigs' urination and defecation. The ship's boiler can supply steam to heat pig feed. The ship is equipped with a small slaughterhouse, cold storage, and veterinary room. Each floor has heating and ventilation equipment. These barges can safely transport live pigs on the Yangtze River in both cold and hot seasons.

Fifteen 500-horsepower tugboats are new types of vessels that the Shanghai Shipyard is manufacturing for the first time. These tugboats have an average draft of only 2.4 meters. Even during the Yangtze River's dry season, they can still tow more than 5,000 tons of cargo upstream to Yichang Port in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The tugboats' boilers and machinery are newly designed and more efficient than existing tugboats of the same horsepower, while their hourly coal consumption is reduced by more than 100 kilograms.

Among the ships that the Shanghai Shipyard is manufacturing for the Yangtze River are four 1,000-ton freighters, two passenger-cargo ships carrying 452 passengers and 450 tons of cargo, two 700-ton barges, and two 2,000-horsepower tugboats. The 2,000-horsepower tugboat is currently the most powerful tugboat in our country, capable of pushing more than 2,300 tons of cargo upstream in the turbulent waters of the Sichuan River.

Since 1953, Shanghai's shipyards have manufactured 172 tugboats, barges, freighters, survey ships, and passenger-cargo ships of various sizes for the Yangtze River. The horsepower of the tugboats and the tonnage of the barges are 0.7 times and 0.5 times greater than the tugboats and barges left behind by the Kuomintang reactionaries who operated Yangtze River shipping for decades, respectively.

    上海造船工厂推陈出新改进设计
    长江上将出现一批新型船舶
    马力最大的拖轮可逆水顶推两千吨货物
    新运猪驳船严冬酷暑都能保证生猪安全
    据新华社上海19日电　上海的造船工厂，正在制造大批航行长江的拖轮、驳船、货轮和客货轮。
    一种运输生猪的驳船，今年将制造四艘，其中三艘已经完成船壳工程，开始安装机器。这是一种有趣的专用船，上面有四层楼房，每次可载运一千八百多头生猪。船两侧有专供猪子大小便的水槽，船的锅炉可以供应蒸汽烧热猪食。船上设有小型的屠宰场、冷藏室和兽医室，每层楼房都有暖气和吹风的设备。在严寒和酷热的季节，用这种驳船都可以平安地在长江上运输生猪。
    十五艘五百匹马力的拖轮，是上海造船工厂第一次进行制造的新型船舶。这种拖轮平均吃水只有二点四公尺，在长江枯水期间，仍能拖运五千多吨货物上溯航行到长江中游的宜昌港，拖轮的锅炉和机器都是新设计的，效率比旧有的同马力拖轮高，每小时的耗煤量反而要减少一百多公斤。
    上海造船工厂正在制造的航行长江的船舶中，还有四艘载货一千吨的货轮，两艘载客四百五十二人、载货四百五十吨的客货轮，两艘载货七百吨的驳船和两艘二千匹马力的拖轮。二千匹马力的拖轮是目前我国马力最大的一种拖轮，在水流湍急的川江上，能够逆水顶推二千三百多吨货物。
    从1953年以来，上海的造船工厂已经制造出长江上的一百七十二艘大小拖轮、驳船、货轮、测量船和客货轮。其中拖轮的马力数和驳船的吨数分别比国民党反动派经营长江航运几十年留下来的拖轮和驳船超过了零点七倍和零点五倍。
