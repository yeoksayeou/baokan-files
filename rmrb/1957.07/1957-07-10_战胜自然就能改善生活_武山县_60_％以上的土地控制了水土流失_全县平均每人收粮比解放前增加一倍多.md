Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th - In Wushan County, Gansu Province, nearly 60% of the 1,600 square kilometers of total area has basically controlled soil erosion. In recent years, the county has expanded its irrigated area by 134,000 mu, equivalent to three times the original irrigated land before liberation.

Wushan County is a loess hilly and gully area in the Wei River basin, with hillside land accounting for more than 88% of the total cultivated land. In the past, the county suffered from alarming soil erosion and a dry climate, resulting in extremely low crop yields. Consequently, the people lived in poverty, with one-third of the county's farmers lacking land and housing.

Since 1952, the county has gradually carried out soil and water conservation work. Now, more than 60% of the county has achieved a landscape where water does not leave the fields, mud does not leave the gullies, and all areas are greened. Before liberation, the average grain yield per person here was 300 jin, but now it is 700 jin. Mahe Township, the poorest township in the county, has seen its grain income increase three times compared to before liberation due to the great development of soil and water conservation work, and more than 90% of the households have enough to eat and use. The miserable scene of "nine droughts in ten years, nine empty houses in ten" has disappeared from many villages in the county.

    战胜自然就能改善生活
    武山县60％以上的土地控制了水土流失
    全县平均每人收粮比解放前增加一倍多
    据新华社兰州8日电　甘肃省武山县一千六百平方公里的总面积内，已有近60％基本上控制了水土流失现象。几年来，全县扩大灌溉面积十三万四千亩，相当于解放前原有水地的三倍。
    武山县是渭河流域的一个黄土丘陵沟壑地区，山坡地占总耕地面积的88％以上。过去这个县水土流失现象惊人，而且气候干燥，农作物产量特低。因此，人民生活困苦，全县有三分之一农民少地无房。
    1952年以来，这个县逐步开展水土保持工作。现在全县60％以上的地区做到了水不出田、泥不出沟、全部绿化的景象。解放前这里平均每人收粮食三百斤，而现在是七百斤。全县最穷苦的马河乡，因为水土保持工作大发展，目前粮食收入比解放前增加三倍，90％以上农户够吃够用。过去“十年九旱、十室九空”的凄惨景象，已在这个县的许多村庄中一去不复返了。
