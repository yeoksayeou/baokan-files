The Phenomenon of Haphazard and Careless Official Documents Should Be Changed
Ye Shengtao said in a written statement that written language must not be treated carelessly; people understand your principles, policies, and methods entirely based on the written language in official documents.

I support Chairman Mao Zedong's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen.

Today, I will only express one idea, hoping that government agencies and organizations will pay attention to all types of official documents they issue. Official documents do not necessarily have to be good articles, but they must be written clearly, precisely, with solid sentences and appropriate words, and in a smooth style so that people can understand exactly what you are saying.

I often feel that many official documents fail to achieve this. Let me interject that I am talking about many official documents, not all of them. Those documents are written vaguely and carelessly; people can roughly understand what they are saying, but not exactly, and they have to guess at the meaning themselves.

Let's think about the purpose of issuing official documents. If an instruction is issued, and it talks about principles and policies, it is intended that the person reading the instruction understands these principles and policies. If a notice is issued, and it talks about specific methods, it is intended that the person reading the notice understands these specific methods. In addition, things like writing requests, reports, and work summaries are all about clarifying the main situation, drawing some lessons from it, and discussing or determining the future course and method of work. Can these official documents be vague and careless? Once they are vague and careless, people may understand it one way, or they may understand it another way. In other words, being vague and careless lays the root for misunderstanding. However, principles and policies absolutely must not be misunderstood, and specific methods must not be misunderstood either. The consequences of misunderstanding are always losses in practical work, and by no means small losses. Therefore, clarity and smoothness are extremely necessary.

To achieve clarity and smoothness, one must think clearly about the meaning. If you haven't thought clearly, even great writers cannot achieve clarity and smoothness. If you have thought clearly, the organizational structure of the official document will naturally be the organizational structure of the meaning itself, which will allow it to be logical and orderly. If you have thought clearly, you will naturally know what each paragraph and each sentence should say, and what tone and words to use, which will allow you to create sentences and use words appropriately. An official document with a logical and orderly structure, creating sentences and using words appropriately, can allow people to understand it exactly.

I say that many official documents cannot achieve clarity and smoothness. I am very sorry that I cannot give examples here; giving too many would be too troublesome, and giving too few would be incomplete. I can only talk about the general situation of those official documents. Those official documents are mostly very disorganized, with divergent thoughts and incoherence. In other words, those official documents have very poor logic, not like a calculation formula, where one step builds on another, without any ambiguity. What should be said at the beginning is said in the middle. What has already been said in the front is said again in the back, and the wording is somewhat different from the front. Things that are completely unnecessary to say are said without any basis. The front clearly states that it will be discussed in three points, but by the time it gets to the back, there are only two points left, and the order of the two points is reversed. Situations like these are shortcomings in terms of organization. Secondly, those official documents mostly put the meaning casually into mature and set sentence forms, unwilling to work hard to find the most appropriate sentence forms to express this or that meaning. Doing this saves effort, but it damages the meaning and forms a formulaic style. Sentence creation and word usage are extremely free, writing whatever comes to mind, without considering whether it is appropriate or not, whether it can be used or not. Referring to the same object, several different names are used in one official document. Function words, conditional phrases, and adjectives are used very generously, believing that more is better. Sometimes, however, they are very stingy, and a "的" (de) or "了" (le) that must be used is not used. Situations like these cause the sentences in the official documents to violate the rules of grammar, rhetoric, and logic.

It is only natural that such official documents are not considered good articles. It doesn't matter if they are not considered good articles. However, when you think about the implementation of principles and policies, the implementation of specific measures... the matter becomes significant. If people read such official documents and do not understand them thoroughly, or even misunderstand them, that is a very serious matter!

On the surface, the failure to achieve clarity and smoothness in official documents seems to be just a matter of ability; if the writing is poor, it is naturally not written well. In fact, there is also a problem of understanding involved, that is, the view of the role and requirements of official documents is not very appropriate. That view believes that as long as you think about it roughly in your mind, that's enough, and as for how to express it and fix it on the official document, it's okay to be casual. They don't know that no matter how you think in your mind, people have absolutely no way to understand it unless you say it or write it down. People can only understand what you are thinking in your mind by relying on the written language you write on official documents, except when they hear you speak in person. The written language written on official documents is like a bridge, and it is the only bridge. Since the role of official documents is like this, the requirements for official documents must be strict, and they must accurately express what you are thinking in your mind, exactly and appropriately. That view is the opposite, not valuing the bridging role of official documents, and not making strict requirements for expression, thinking that it's okay to be casual. I say it is not very appropriate, and that is the reason. I heard that a few comrades said something to the effect of: "It's okay how it's written, it doesn't matter, the people below will always be able to understand what we mean." This is an example of that view.

Because the view is not very appropriate, the following situations occur from drafting to finalizing. In theory, an official document should be drafted when it has been considered mature, and it should be written by someone who understands it most thoroughly and thinks about it most clearly. When someone like that writes at a time like that, the form and content can roughly match, and with some effort to refine and improve it, it is easy to reach a fairly perfect level. However, many official documents are drafted before that time has arrived, and are written by people who are not like that. They don't understand enough and can't think clearly, but because the task has been assigned, they have to grit their teeth and write. After the draft is written, it must of course go through several discussions and revisions. However, the initial draft has already determined the structure, and if the structure is not very good, it is difficult to make it perfect no matter how much you work on it, and it is better to start from scratch. Starting from scratch is inevitably troublesome, and to save effort, they just add a little work on the basis of the initial draft and get by with it. This is one situation. Also, when the official document draft is circulated and studied, some people sign their opinions on it, and some people revise it, adding a few sentences, deleting a few sentences, changing a few words, or crossing out the original text. If everyone has a comprehensive view, and makes suggestions or revisions in one place while taking into account the whole article and the opinions or revisions of others, that is of course no problem. However, not many people can do this; most people only care about the local area, ignoring the whole article, only caring about themselves, regardless of others. The person who does the final sorting is in trouble; he has to accommodate the opinions or revisions of this person and that person, at least trying to take care of them as much as possible, which is even more difficult than sewing a patchwork quilt. This is another situation. There is also a situation where, after the official document draft has been commented on or revised by many people, it is no longer carefully sorted, and only the acceptable opinions are absorbed into it, and it is then copied and issued. The quality of official documents finalized under the above three situations is destined to be not very high.

To improve the quality of official documents, the first thing to do is to solve the problem of understanding of the people who issue official documents. Solving the problem of understanding is not difficult either, just remember one sentence: people understand your principles, policies, specific methods, etc. entirely based on the written language written on official documents, so written language must not be treated carelessly. Secondly, the process of official documents from drafting to finalizing should be noted. It should be written by the most appropriate person when it has been considered mature, and many people should participate in refining and improving it, and everyone should consider the whole article. Thirdly, everyone who touches the official document draft should put some effort into grammar, rhetoric, and logic, not only reading some books, but especially paying attention to practice. This is also a necessary condition for writing good official documents.

Since official documents are something that is indispensable in practical work, they must be written well. Requiring that official documents be written well is by no means bureaucracy; writing and issuing official documents casually is bureaucracy. Speaking of issuing official documents, I think we should act in accordance with the commonly used formula of "can be × can not be ×, not ×", and not issue what can be not issued. If what can be not issued is also issued, it will not only confuse people, but also hinder practical work. Bureaucracy is considered a bad ideology, and this is one of the reasons.

Thinking of others at all times and in all places is a moral item of the new society. Requiring that official documents be written well is thinking of work, and it is also thinking of the people who read the official documents. These are inherently inseparable; work will only benefit when the people who read the official documents understand them clearly and thoroughly. Speaking of thinking of the people who read the official documents, there are also some small details that can be said. For example, in order to save the energy and time of the people who read the official documents, the official documents should be written as concisely as possible. If one meaning can be expressed in two ways, one clear and the other obscure, the clear one should be adopted. Considering that complex sentence forms may cause trouble for people, they should be broken down into several sentences that do not damage the original meaning. Considering that those words in philosophical books, those "jargon" that only circulate in a small circle, are not very familiar to people, and that people may misunderstand them, they should be used as little as possible, and only when they must be used. Practices like these are good for the people who read the official documents, and of course they are also good for work.

At this point, I have finished my meaning, and I respectfully ask for the guidance of all the representatives. If all the representatives think that some of it is pertinent, please everyone advocate and practice it, and pay attention to all types of official documents issued by relevant government agencies and organizations. One more thing, since I have written down my words, and the secretariat of the conference has printed out my written words, it is enough for all the representatives to read this printed matter, so I will not read it again.

    公文写得含糊草率的现象应当改变
    叶圣陶在书面发言中说，书面语言马虎不得，人家了解你的方针政策办法全凭在公文上的书面语言
    我拥护毛泽东主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演和周恩来总理李先念副总理薄一波副总理张鼎丞检察长董必武院长彭真秘书长的报告。
    今天我发言只说一个意思，希望机关团体注意所发的各类公文。公文不一定要好文章，可是必须写得一清二楚，十分明确，句稳词妥，文体通顺，让人家不折不扣地了解你说的是什么。
    我常觉得有不少的公文不能做到这一点。插一句，我说的是不少的公文，不是所有的公文。那些公文写得含糊草率，人家能大致了解它说的是什么，可是不能不折不扣地了解，还得自己去揣摩。
    不妨想一想所以要发公文的用意。发一件指示，说的如果是方针政策，那就是要看指示的人了解这个方针政策。发一份通知，说的如果是具体办法，那就是要看通知的人了解这些具体办法。此外如写请示报告工作总结之类，无非要叙明主要的情况，从中归纳出一些经验教训，商量或确定以后工作的途径和方法。这些公文能含糊草率吗？一含糊，一草率，人家就可能这样了解，也可能那样了解。换句话说，一含糊，一草率，就伏下了错误了解的根。可是方针政策绝对不能让人家错误了解，具体办法也不能让人家错误了解，错误了解的后果总是实际工作上的损失，而且决非小损失。因此，明确通顺是极端必要的。
    要做到明确通顺，必须把意思想清楚。没想清楚，即使是文章大家也做不到明确通顺。想清楚了，公文的组织结构自然就是意思本身的组织结构，这才能做到有条有理。想清楚了，哪一段哪一句该怎么样说，该用怎么样的语气和词儿说，自然都有数了，这才能做到造句遣词各得其当。组织结构有条有理，造句遣词各得其当，这样明确通顺的公文，才能让人家不折不扣地了解。
    我说有不少的公文不能做到明确通顺，很抱歉，我没法在这儿举实例，多举太麻烦，举少了又挂一漏万。我只能说一说那些公文的一般情形。那些公文大都条理很乱，思路纷歧，前后不连贯。换句话说，那些公文逻辑性很差，不像算式那样，一步顶一步推演下去，毫不含糊。应该在头里说的，放到中段去说了。前边说过了的，后边又说了，而且说法跟前边有些出入了。完全不需要说的，也无根无据地说进去了。前边明明交代，分三项来说，说到后边，却只剩两项了，而且两项的次序颠倒了。诸如此类的情形都是条理方面的缺点。其次，那些公文大都把意思随便纳入已成熟套的语句形式，不肯努力找出表达这个那个意思最恰当的语句形式。这样办，省事固然省事，却损害了意思，形成公式化。造句遣词是极度地自由，想到什么就写什么，不考虑适当不适当，用得上用不上。指的是同一对象，在一件公文里竟用上好几个不同的名称。虚词，条件语，形容词语，用得非常慷慨，以多为胜。有时候却又非常吝啬，一个非用不可的“的”字或“了”字也舍不得用。诸如此类的情形使公文的语句违背了语法修辞逻辑的规律。
    这样的公文算不得好文章是当然。算不得好文章，没有什么关系。可是，想到方针政策的贯彻，具体办法的实施……关系就大了。人家看了这样的公文，要是了解得不透彻，甚或得到错误的了解，那是多么严重的事啊！
    就表面看，公文不能做到明确通顺，似乎只是能力问题，笔下不济事，自然写不好。其实这里头还伏着个认识问题，就是说，对于公文的作用和要求，看法不怎么妥当。那种看法认为只要头脑里想得差不多就成，至于怎么样表达出来，把它固定在公文上，不妨随便。不知道无论你头脑里想得怎么样，在没有说出来或写下来的时候，人家绝对没办法了解。人家除了当面听你口说而外，只有凭借你写在公文上的书面语言，才能了解你头脑里想的是什么。写在公文上的书面语言好比一道桥梁，而且是唯一的桥梁。公文的作用既然如此，对于公文的要求就不能不严格，必须确切地表达出头脑里所想的，不折不扣，恰如其分。那种看法刚刚相反，不看重公文的桥梁作用，对于表达不作严格的要求，以为不妨随便，我说它不怎么妥当，原由就在此。听说有少数几位同志说过大意如下的话：“怎么写都成，没关系，下边总能够体会咱们的意思”。这就是那种看法的实例。
    由于看法不怎么妥当，从起稿到定稿就有如下的情形。按理说，一件公文，应该在考虑到成熟的时候起稿，应该由了解得最透彻想得最清楚的人执笔。在那样的时候由那样的人执笔，形式跟内容大致能够相符，再加上些斟酌损益的工夫，很容易达到相当完善的地步。可是有不少的公文，还没到那样的时候就起稿，执笔的并不是那样的人。他们了解不够，想不清楚，只因任务交了下来，不能不硬着头皮执笔。稿子起好之后，当然要经过好几回讨论和修改。可是初稿已经把格局规定了，如果格局不怎么像样，尽你加工也很难使它完善，还不如另起炉灶。另起炉灶不免麻烦，为了省事，还是在初稿的基础上加点儿工，将就过去。这是一种情形。还有，公文稿在传阅研究的时候，有的人在上边签点儿意见，有的人就动手修改，加上几句，删掉几句，改动几个字，或者把原文钩来钩去。要是个个人都有全面观点，在一处地方提意见或在一处地方改动，都能照顾到全篇，照顾到别人的意见或改动，那当然没问题。可是能够这样做的人并不多，多数是只顾局部，忽略全篇，只顾自己，不管别人。最后整理的人可苦了，他要把这个人那个人的意见或改动都容纳进去，至少要尽量照顾到，真比缝一件百衲衣还难。这又是一种情形。还有一种情形，公文稿经过好些人提意见或改动之后，不再仔细整理，只把可以采纳的意见吸收了进去，就此缮印发出。在以上三种情形之下定稿的公文，质量不会怎么高是注定的。
    要提高公文的质量，首先要解决发公文的人的认识问题。解决认识问题也不难，只要记住一句话：人家了解你的方针政策具体办法之类全凭写在公文上的书面语言，所以书面语言马虎不得。其次，公文从起稿到定稿的过程应该注意。要在考虑到成熟的时候由最适当的人执笔，好些人参加斟酌损益，人人要就全篇着想。又其次，凡是触及公文稿的人要在语法修辞逻辑各方面用点儿功，不光是看些书本，尤其要注重实践。这也是写好公文的必要条件。
    公文在实际工作中既然是非要不可的东西，就得把它写好。要求把公文写好决非文牍主义，随随便便写公文发公文才是文牍主义。说到发公文，我以为应该按照通常应用的“可×可不×，不×”的公式办事，可不发的就不发。如果可不发的也发，非但徒乱人意，而且妨碍实际工作。文牍主义被认为不好的主义，这是原因之一。
    随时随地为别人着想，是新社会的一个道德条目。要求把公文写好，是为工作着想，也是为看公文的人着想。这本来是分不开的，必须让看公文的人了解得清楚透彻，工作上才会有好处。说到为看公文的人着想，还有些小节目可以说的。譬如，为了节省看公文的人的精力和时间，公文就该尽可能写得简而得要。一层意思可以用两种说法表达，一种明快，一种晦涩，就该采用明快的一种。考虑到繁复的句子形式可能引起人家的麻烦，就该把它化开，化成并不损害原意的几句。考虑到哲学书籍上的那些词语，仅仅流行在小范围内的那些“行话”，人家不太熟悉吧，人家可能发生误解吧，就该尽量少用，到非用不可的时候才用。诸如此类的做法，对于看公文的人有好处，对于工作当然也有好处。
    到这儿，我的意思说完了，敬恳各位代表指教。如果各位代表认为有些中肯，就请大家来鼓吹和实践，注意有关的机关团体所发的各类公文。还有一点，我既然把话写下来，大会秘书处既然把我写下来的话印出来，各位代表看这份印刷品尽够了，因此，我不再把它念一遍了。
