Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Yang Xiguang, Vice President of Fudan University, professors Zhang Jin'yi, Su Buqing, and eleven others, along with staff members of the Liberation Daily and Xinwen Daily, who were falsely accused by rightist Sun Dayu of being counter-revolutionaries and members of a counter-revolutionary group, gathered tonight to demand that the People's Procuratorate file a public prosecution against Sun Dayu and other reactionary groups and impose legal sanctions to safeguard the legitimate rights of citizens.

Sun Dayu is a member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and a professor in the Foreign Languages Department of Fudan University. At the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference on December 20 last year, he publicly accused Chen Qi'wu, Director of the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau, former Secretary of the Fudan University Party Committee Li Zhengwen, Vice President of Fudan University Yang Xiguang, and non-Party professors Quan Zenghua, Zhang Jin'yi, Qi Qisheng, and more than ten others of being counter-revolutionaries. At a rectification forum held by the Fudan University Party Committee on June 7 this year, Sun Dayu, in addition to continuing to falsely accuse these people of being counter-revolutionaries, also accused the Liberation Daily and Xinwen Daily of having counter-revolutionary groups. Today, employees of the Liberation Daily and Xinwen Daily went to Sun Dayu's home to question him. Sun Dayu said that Jin Zhonghua, President of Xinwen Daily, was a counter-revolutionary. However, when asked who in the Liberation Daily was a counter-revolutionary, Sun was unable to answer. Sun Dayu's egregious behavior of wanton slander and false accusation aroused public indignation.

At tonight's meeting, those who were falsely accused by Sun Dayu all believed that Sun Dayu's actions were by no means a personal matter, but a planned sabotage activity by a rightist group. Qi Qisheng said that last year, Mayor Chen Yi invited Fudan professors to mediate the matter of Sun Dayu's accusations. Sun Dayu, Chen Renbing, Wang Zao Shi, and Zhang Mengwen sang in chorus for more than three hours. Now it seems that these rightists had made planned deployments at that time. Zhang Jin'yi revealed that Sun Dayu had been a member of the Hu Shi and Liang Shiqiu faction from a very early time. Later, he transferred to the Central Political School, a school of the Kuomintang, to teach, relying on Zhang Daofan and Chen Xueping. On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, he colluded with Luo Longji and others, attempting to control the university teachers' organization, "Da Jiao Lian." Wang Wei, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Xinwen Daily, exposed the specific facts of this right-wing group creating a so-called list of counter-revolutionaries. He said that the reason Xinwen Daily was falsely accused of having a counter-revolutionary group was that an editorial criticized the shortcomings of a small number of intellectuals. Lu Yi inquired within the newspaper about who had written it. As a result, Sun Dayu's list of "counter-revolutionaries" included the Xinwen Daily.

Li Shutang and four other legal advisors who were invited to attend the meeting analyzed Sun Dayu's behavior based on national laws and believed that the victims had sufficient reason to request the People's Procuratorate to conduct an investigation and file a public prosecution. If Sun Dayu's accusations were indeed unfounded, they should be dealt with according to law to protect the legitimate rights of citizens.

The victims present at the meeting immediately commissioned legal counsel to draft an indictment, accusing Sun Dayu of slander and defamation against Chen Qi'wu, Yang Xiguang, Zhang Jin'yi, and others as counter-revolutionaries, and repeatedly refusing to correct his behavior, violating criminal law, and filed a complaint with the People's Procuratorate.

### 保障公民合法权利　不容右派分子诬蔑好人  杨西光等将向检察院控告孙大雨

    保障公民合法权利　不容右派分子诬蔑好人
    杨西光等将向检察院控告孙大雨
    新华社上海4日电　被右派分子孙大雨诬告为反革命分子和反革命集团的复旦大学副校长杨西光、教授章靳以、苏步青等十一人和解放日报、新闻日报的工作人员在今晚集会，要求人民检察院对孙大雨等反动集团提起公诉，给予法律制裁，以保障公民的合法权利。
    孙大雨是民盟上海市委委员、复旦大学外文系教授。他在去年12月20日上海市政协会议上公开指控上海市高教局局长陈其五、前中共复旦大学党委书记李正文，复旦大学副校长杨西光及非党教授全增嘏、章靳以、漆琪生等十多人为反革命分子。今年6月7日中共复旦大学党委举行的整风座谈会上，孙大雨除了仍然诬告这些人为反革命分子外，又指控解放日报、新闻日报有反革命集团。今天解放日报和新闻日报职工到孙大雨家中质问。孙大雨说新闻日报社社长金仲华为反革命分子。但当问他解放日报中谁是反革命分子时，孙无以对答。孙大雨这种肆意诽谤诬蔑的恶劣行为，引起了大家的公愤。
    在今晚的会议上，被孙大雨诬告的人都认为孙大雨的行动绝不是个人问题，而是右派集团有计划的破坏活动。漆琪生说，去年陈毅市长为孙大雨控告的事曾邀请复旦教授进行调解。孙大雨、陈仁炳、王造时、张孟闻四人一唱一和，讲了三个多钟头，现在看来，当时这些右派分子已经作了有计划的部署。章靳以揭露孙大雨很早以前就是胡适、梁实秋一派的人，以后他又转入国民党的党校——中央政治学校教书，投靠张道藩、陈雪屏。上海解放前夕，又和罗隆基等勾结，企图把持大学教师的组织“大教联”。新闻日报副总编辑王维揭发这个右派集团制造所谓反革命分子名单的具体事实。他说，新闻日报之所以被诬告有反革命集团是因为在一篇社论中批评了少数知识分子的缺点，陆诒就在报社内部打听是谁写的，由此，孙大雨的“反革命分子”名单中就增加了新闻日报。
    应邀出席这次会议的法律顾问李树棠等五人，根据国家的法律和孙大雨的行为分析，认为被害人已有充分理由要求人民检察院进行侦察，提起公诉。如果孙大雨的控告确实没有根据就应依法处理，以保障公民的合法权利。
    到会的被害人当场委托法律顾问起草控告书，对孙大雨诬蔑诽谤陈其五、杨西光、章靳以等为反革命分子，屡戒不改触犯刑律，向人民检察院提出控告。
