Xinhua News Agency, July 30th—The United States, Britain, France, and West Germany signed a joint declaration on the German question in Berlin on July 29.

The declaration puts forward twelve "principles" for resolving the German question. These "principles" do not contain any new and constructive suggestions that would help Germany reunify.

The declaration repeats the Western countries' claim that a pan-German government must be established through so-called "free elections." However, it completely fails to mention important issues that are absolutely necessary for holding any truly free elections for a unified Germany, such as preventing the revival of German militarism in West Germany and preventing a unified Germany from joining exclusive military blocs. On the contrary, the Four-Power Declaration demands that a reunified Germany "should not be forced to neutralize or demilitarize."

The declaration also completely fails to mention the withdrawal of Western countries' troops from a unified Germany. Instead, it says that Western countries cannot consider the existence of NATO itself to be a matter for negotiation.

This declaration also fails to mention negotiations between the two Germanys to create conditions for reunification. On the contrary, it completely ignores the ironclad fact of the existence of the German Democratic Republic and arrogantly proclaims the West German government as the "only government qualified to speak for the entire German people" from the outset.

In discussing the relationship between the German question and disarmament issues, this declaration demands that a comprehensive disarmament agreement must be premised on first resolving the German reunification issue. It also states: Western countries do not intend to participate in any so-called "disarmament agreement that would harm German reunification."

On the same day, West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer expressed "disappointment" with the Four-Power Declaration. He said that this declaration would only exacerbate international tensions. The West German Free Democratic Party also expressed regret over the declaration. It said: "The Berlin Declaration is a document that proves that the Bonn government has reached a dead end."

### 美英法和西德签署联合宣言  进一步阻挠德国统一  西德两大反对党表示不满

    美英法和西德签署联合宣言
    进一步阻挠德国统一
    西德两大反对党表示不满
    据新华社30日讯　美国、英国、法国和西德7月29日在柏林签署了一项关于德国问题的联合宣言。
    宣言提出了解决德国问题的十二点“原则”，这些“原则”中没有任何有助于德国重新统一的新的和建设性的建议。
    宣言重复了西方国家关于必须通过举行所谓“自由选举”来建立一个全德政府的主张，但是，它完全没有提到像制止德国军国主义在西德复活和统一后的德国不得参加排他性的军事集团这样一些对于举行任何统一德国的真正自由选举都是绝对必要的条件的重要问题。相反地，四国宣言要求，对于恢复统一后的德国“不应当强迫它中立化或者非军事化”。
    宣言中也完全没有提到从统一后的德国撤退西方国家军队的问题，反而说西方国家不能考虑北大西洋公约组织本身的存在会成为谈判的问题。
    这项宣言也没有提到两个德国进行谈判为恢复统一创造条件的问题。相反地，它完全无视德意志民主共和国的存在这一铁的事实，一开始就狂妄地把西德政府自封作“有资格代表全体德国人民发言的唯一政府”。
    在谈到德国问题同裁军问题的关系时，这项宣言要求，全面裁军协定必须以首先解决德国统一问题为前提，并且说：西方国家不打算参加所谓“会损害德国重新统一的任何裁军协定”。
    同一天，西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔对四国宣言表示“失望”。他说，这项宣言只会加剧国际紧张局势。西德自由民主党也对这个宣言表示遗憾。它说：“柏林宣言是证明波恩政府走入绝境的文件。”
