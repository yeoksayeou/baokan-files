Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st: Zhejiang Province has begun the comprehensive harvesting of over ten million mu of early rice, and joyous news of bumper harvests is pouring in from everywhere. Preliminary estimates from the Wenzhou, Jinhua, Jiande, and Ningbo Special Districts indicate that the average per-mu yield of early rice has increased compared to last year's bumper harvest. In more than ten counties such as Songyang, Yongkang, Pujiang, and Suichang, where harvesting has been widely completed, it is estimated that production will increase by 10% to 30% compared to last year. Xiangshan County, which suffered severe damage from typhoons after last year's early rice harvest, has seen another widespread bumper harvest of 200,000 mu of early rice this year, with an estimated average yield of around 450 jin per mu, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year.

The double-cropping early rice that has been expanded in various regions has the best harvest, with many high yields appearing. In the Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua and other special districts, many agricultural cooperatives have an average early rice yield of more than 500 jin per mu.

    浙江每亩产量超过丰收年
    据新华社杭州21日电　浙江省一千多万亩早稻已全面开始收割，到处传来丰收喜讯。温州、金华、建德、宁波等专区据初步预计，早稻每亩平均产量都比大丰收的去年有所增加。已普遍收割的松阳、永康、浦江、遂昌等十多县，预计能比去年增产一成到三成。去年早稻丰收后被台风侵袭，受灾严重的象山县，今年二十万亩早稻又普遍丰收，预计平均每亩可产四百五十斤左右，比去年增产一成以上。
    各地扩种的双季连作早稻收成最好，出现了很多高额产量。温州、宁波、金华等专区不少农业社早稻每亩平均产量在五百斤以上。
