I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government and the reports of other responsible comrades.

I am an agricultural science and technology worker, and have been engaged in cotton research and improvement. Now, the bourgeois rightists say: The Communist Party cannot lead science. China's scientific undertakings have lagged behind the Kuomintang era after liberation. The problem for the next twelve years is not catching up with international levels, but making up for the past twelve years of lessons. It seems that since liberation, China's scientific and technological work has not only made no achievements, but has regressed. Now, based on my personal experience, I will report to you on the situation of cotton science and technology work before and after liberation. Use ironclad facts to thoroughly expose the anti-Party conspiracy of the rightists.

Great Achievements in Improved Cotton Varieties

First, let's talk about the improvement of cotton varieties in China: As early as the late Qing Dynasty, China's textile industry had made some progress. From 1898, upland cotton improved varieties were promoted in Hubei and other provinces. During the period of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang, upland cotton improved varieties were also promoted domestically. However, until 1949, the area that could be promoted with upland cotton improved varieties was only 4.2 million mu, accounting for only about 10% of the national cotton fields at that time. After liberation, in just seven years, the area of upland cotton improved varieties has reached 84.05 million mu, accounting for about 90% of the national cotton field area, an increase of 19 times compared to 1949. Due to the popularization of improved cotton varieties, the quality of cotton fiber in China has also been greatly improved. In the early days of liberation in 1950, only 7.3% of the national commodity cotton had cotton fiber longer than one inch that could be spun into fine yarn, but by 1955, it had increased to 72.28%. Due to the popularization of improved cotton varieties, the needs of China's textile industry have been guaranteed, and the situation in which all medium and fine yarn raw materials completely relied on foreign cotton imports during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been fundamentally reversed. In terms of methods of breeding improved varieties, after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Chinese cotton scientific workers used interspecific hybridization between upland cotton and *Gossypium barbadense*, as well as asexual hybridization between upland cotton and sea island cotton, and other methods to breed improved varieties of long-staple cotton No. 2 and long-staple cotton No. 3. This scientific method of breeding new varieties has attracted the attention of international scientific workers, especially Soviet scientists. Before liberation, it was always a question whether sea island cotton, which is used for spinning high-grade fine yarn, could be grown in China. Although many years of experiments had been conducted, no reliable answer was found. After liberation, Chinese cotton scientific workers actively engaged in experimental research in this area and achieved great results. It has been confirmed that sea island cotton can be grown in Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guangdong and other regions of China. This has made a huge contribution to the development of China's textile industry. These facts all show that China's cotton variety and quality improvement work has made great achievements after liberation. I want to ask the rightists, how do you explain this fact?

Improved Cultivation Techniques, Large Areas of High-Yielding Cotton Fields

In terms of cotton cultivation techniques, Chinese farmers have a long history and rich experience. However, before liberation, the reactionary ruling class did not pay attention to the valuable experience of the masses of farmers. Cotton scientific research only focused on variety selection and did not pay attention to the research and improvement of cultivation techniques. The reactionary government did not allow scientific workers to go to the countryside frequently. Some scientific workers went deep into the countryside, approached the masses, and conducted investigations and research, but were framed by the reactionaries. Scientific research could not be combined with production practice, so the experience of farmers could not be summarized for a long time, and cotton planting techniques could not be improved. After liberation, cotton scientific workers, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, paid attention to summarizing and promoting the cotton planting technology experience of the masses. At the same time, they learned and applied the advanced Soviet cotton planting science and technology. Now, China has a complete set of scientific cultivation techniques for cotton cultivation. At present, the widely used advanced technologies such as close planting, early sowing, deep plowing, pruning, and fertilization were not affirmed or were fundamentally denied by the cotton science community in the past. Due to the improvement of cultivation techniques and the exploitation of production increase potential, high-yielding and large-area high-yielding achievements that had never been seen before have continuously emerged in cotton areas across the country after liberation. In 1952, the high-yielding cotton field of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, achieved an average yield of 1,021 jin of seed cotton per mu (9.9 times higher than the national average yield that year). In 1955, the Manas River cotton area in Xinjiang achieved an average yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu on a large area of more than 80,000 mu of cotton fields (2.8 times higher than the national average yield that year), and the unit area yield of high-yielding fields reached 1,392 jin of seed cotton per mu (12.2 times higher than the national average). In the double-cropping cotton areas in the Yangtze River basin, the cultivation was extensive and the yield was very low in the past. After liberation, the double-cropping technology was vigorously studied and improved. Now, many areas have achieved bumper harvests of both cotton and grain. For example, the unit area yield of more than 8 million mu of double-cropping cotton fields in Hubei Province increased by more than doubled in 1955 compared with 1950. There are more than 500 large-area high-yielding cooperatives in Hubei with an average yield of more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu (2.2 times higher than the national average yield that year).

The Masses Mastered Advanced Pest Control Techniques

Let's take a look at the work of preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests. In the Kuomintang era, personnel engaged in cotton disease research could only carry some simple medicines and machines to farms or rural areas to carry out publicity and demonstration work on preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests. Very few farmers in cotton areas used scientific methods to carry out mass prevention and control work. The medicines used were also less effective, such as tobacco water and cotton oil emulsion. The equipment for spraying medicines was even scarcer, mainly using manual dipping methods. After liberation, the situation completely changed. Now, China has widely applied modern and highly effective pesticides such as 666, 1605, 1059, and DDT. Modernized insect control medicines and machines have been widely used throughout the country. Advanced insect control techniques have been mastered by the vast masses of farmers. In recent years, the scope of insect control has reached more than 60% of the national cotton field area. Before liberation, China could not manufacture pesticides such as 666, DDT, 1605, and 1059 at all. However, after liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the efforts of Chinese agricultural scientific workers, China is now able to produce large quantities of 666 and DDT. This year, we can also start producing 1605. The trial production of 1059 has also been successful. China is also able to manufacture methyl bromide for fumigating cottonseeds to kill insects and ceresan for disinfecting cottonseeds. In terms of medicine and machine manufacturing, since 1950, China has been able to produce more than 70,000 sprayers and powder applicators. In 1956, the annual manufacturing capacity has reached more than one million units. It is particularly worth mentioning that since 1955, China has been experimenting with the use of aircraft to control cotton insects. These achievements were truly unimaginable in old China!

Unified Grading, Superior Quality, Superior Price

In terms of cotton grading standards, due to the development of China's textile industry, there is a need for a set of scientific unified grading standards for raw cotton. In the era of reactionary rule, this issue was studied for decades, but it was never implemented. After liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, a series of cotton grading methods were implemented in 1950, and the national unified "Cotton Grading Standard" was announced. These methods and standards have been universally implemented in primary cotton markets across the country in just four years. Farmers can get the benefit of superior quality and superior price when selling cotton. The United States was the first to implement cotton standards, which took 41 years to initially unify the national cotton standards. Now, after 60 years, its cotton standards can only be implemented in intermediate cotton markets, and it only benefits the middle merchants, and farmers cannot get the benefit of superior quality and superior price when selling cotton. This is a clear contrast between the socialist system and the capitalist system; this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of China's socialist system.

The Cotton Science Work Team is Gradually Growing

In the cotton science work team, after liberation, it has gradually grown and developed. Now, there are seven regional agricultural science research institutes in the country that are conducting cotton experimental research work. Agricultural science research institutes, comprehensive experimental stations, and cotton professional experimental stations in cotton-producing provinces and autonomous regions are all conducting cotton scientific research work. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences is preparing to establish a national cotton professional scientific research institute. The state attaches such importance to scientific research, but the rightists say that our scientific work is not as good as the reactionary Kuomintang era. This is a malicious slander against our Party and all scientific workers.

Let's recall the encounters of some of our scientific workers during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang! Take myself as an example: I graduated from Jinling University in 1927, and later studied in the United States. At that time, I was determined to engage in cotton research work and contribute to the improvement of China's cotton industry. However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, my little wish completely failed. The reactionary government did not care about how to develop China's cotton production. A scientific worker could not even find a job without relying on factional activities or personal connections. During the Kuomintang period, I drifted for 19 years, and was unemployed seven times and changed jobs 13 times. The longest time I worked in one unit was four years, and the shortest was only two months. On average, I had to change jobs every year and a half, and I was often not allowed to do cotton scientific work. For a period of time, I even worked as an executive in the YMCA. Such encounters were not uncommon in the old society. Take a look at all the technical personnel engaged in cotton work today! We can all work steadily in certain work positions and actively work hard to develop China's cotton science and production. This is a clear contrast between the new and old societies' treatment of scientific workers. In old China, it was very difficult for a scientific worker to even find an opportunity to engage in scientific work. How could science develop in such an era?

Cotton Planting Science and Technology Work Needs to Be Further Strengthened

Of course, we are not saying that China's cotton science and technology work has no shortcomings in the past few years since liberation. Shortcomings still exist. For example, although we have paid attention to the promotion of cotton varieties, the phenomenon of cotton seed mixing and degradation has not been overcome; various technical measures to overcome natural disasters of cotton, especially rain and flood disasters, have not been studied enough; in terms of cotton cultivation technology, some areas cannot well grasp the principle of adapting to local conditions. These tasks need to be further strengthened, researched, and improved.

But in general, since liberation, the achievements of China's cotton science and technology improvement are extremely great. In terms of cotton yield alone: In 1955, China's total cotton lint yield was 30.36 million dan, an increase of two and a half times compared to 8.88 million dan in 1949, and more than 80% higher than China's highest annual total cotton yield of 16.97 million dan before liberation in 1936. In terms of cotton yield per unit area, in 1955 it was 35.1 jin of lint cotton, an increase of 62.5% compared to 21.6 jin in 1949. Due to the rapid increase in the yield and quality of cotton in China, the situation in which China's raw cotton relied on imports before liberation has been fundamentally reversed.

What I have talked about above is only the achievements of China's cotton science and technology work in the past eight years since liberation. In other industrial raw material crops, food crops, and various departments of agricultural science, similarly huge achievements have been made. This fully demonstrates that the Party attaches importance to science and can actually fully lead scientific work; it also fully confirms that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority in developing scientific and technological work. The rightists say: The Party cannot lead scientific and technological work. We say: The Party is the most brilliant commander guiding us to march towards science. The rightists want to take this opportunity to confuse right and wrong in order to realize their anti-Party and anti-socialist attempts. This is arrogant and ignorant, and we must resolutely fight back against it.

    党是引导我们向科学进军的最英明的指挥者
    杨显东的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告以及其他负责同志的报告。
    我是一个农业科学技术工作者。一向从事棉花的研究和改进工作。现在，资产阶级右派分子说：共产党不能领导科学。中国科学事业在解放后比国民党时代落后了。今后十二年不是赶上国际水平问题，而是补过去十二年课的问题。好像解放以来，我国的科学技术工作不仅毫无成绩，而且倒退了。我现在就亲身的经历，将解放前后棉花科学技术工作的情况向大家汇报一下。用铁的事实，来彻底揭穿右派分子的反党阴谋。
    改良棉花品种取得巨大成就
    首先谈一下我国棉花品种改良情况：远在清朝末叶，我国纺织工业就有了某些发展。从一八九八年开始就在湖北等省推广陆地棉良种。北洋军阀和国民党时代，也曾在国内推广陆地棉良种。可是，直到一九四九年，所能推广的陆地棉良种的面积只有四百二十万亩，在那时全国棉田中，仅仅占到百分之十左右。解放后，经过短短七年的时间，陆地棉良种的面积，已经达到八千四百零五万亩，占全国棉田面积的百分之九十左右，比一九四九年增加了十九倍。由于棉花良种的普及，我国棉花纤维品质也大大提高。在解放初期一九五○年的时候，全国商品棉中，棉花纤维在一英寸以上能纺细纱的，仅仅占百分之七点三，但是到一九五五年，便增加到百分之七十二点二八。由于棉花良种的普及，保证了我国纺织业的需要，也根本扭转了国民党反动统治时期所有中级纱和细纱原料完全依靠外棉进口的情况。在良种选育的方法上，解放后，在党的领导下，我国棉花科学工作者运用中棉和陆地棉的种间杂交以及陆地棉和海岛棉的无性杂交等方法，育成了长绒棉二号和长绒棉三号的良种棉。这种选育新品种的科学方法，已引起了国际科学工作者，尤其是苏联科学家们的注意。在解放前，对于纺织高级细纱的海岛棉，能不能在我国种植，一直是个疑问。虽然也经过多年的试验，但没有找出什么可靠的答案。解放后，我国棉花科学工作者积极地从事这方面的试验研究，并且取得了很大成绩，已经证实在我国的新疆、云南、广东等地区都可以种植海岛棉。这就为发展我国纺织工业作出了巨大贡献。这些事实，都说明了解放后我国的棉花品种和品质改良工作已取得了巨大成就。我要问右派分子，对这一事实作何解释呢？
    改进栽培技术，出现大面积丰产棉田
    在棉花栽培技术方面，我国农民是有悠久历史的，是有丰富的经验的。但在解放以前，反动统治阶级根本不重视农民群众的宝贵经验，棉花科学研究工作，只注意选种，不重视栽培技术的研究和改进。反动政府也不允许科学工作者经常下乡。有些科学工作者深入农村，接近群众，进行调查研究，竟遭到反动派的诬陷。科学研究工作不能和生产实践相结合，因而长期以来农民的经验不能总结，植棉技术得不到提高。解放以后，棉花科学工作者在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，才注意总结和推广群众的植棉技术经验。同时，学习和运用了苏联先进的植棉科学技术。现在，我国栽培棉花已经有一整套的科学栽培技术。目前，广泛采用的密植、早播、深耕、整枝、施肥等等先进技术，在从前的棉花科学界都是没有肯定或者是根本否定的。由于改进了栽培技术，发掘了增产潜力，解放后全国各棉区已不断地出现了过去从来没有见过的高额丰产和大面积丰产的成绩。一九五二年山西翼城县先锋农业生产合作社的丰产棉田，每亩平均产量达到一千零二十一斤籽棉（比当年全国平均产量高9.9倍）。一九五五年新疆玛纳斯河棉区在八万多亩的大面积棉田上，平均每亩产籽棉四百斤（比当年全国平均产量高2.8倍），其中高额丰产田的单位面积产量达到每亩一千三百九十二斤籽棉（比全国平均高12.2倍）。长江流域一带的两熟棉区，过去栽培粗放，产量很低。解放后，大力研究和改进了两熟套作技术。现在，许多地区已经作到了棉粮两熟都丰产。如湖北省八百多万亩两熟棉田的单位面积产量，一九五五年比一九五○年增加了一倍多。湖北平均产三百斤籽棉（比当年全国平均产量高2.2倍）以上的大面积丰产合作社就有五百多个。
    群众掌握了治虫的先进技术
    再看一看防治棉花病虫害的工作。在国民党时代，从事棉花病害研究的人员，只能带点简单的药械在农场或到农村去作一下防治棉花病虫害的宣传和示范工作。棉区农民采用科学方法进行群众性的防治工作是极少的。使用的药剂也是些效力不高的，如烟草水、棉油乳剂等。喷洒药剂的器械更是少得可怜，主要是用手工浸沾法。解放后，情况完全发生了变化。现在，我国已大量地应用666、1605、1059、滴滴涕等现代化的、效力高的农药。近代化的治虫药械已在全国各地普遍使用。先进的治虫技术已为广大农民群众所掌握。近几年，治虫的范围，约达到全国棉田面积的百分之六十以上。解放前，我国根本不会制造666、滴滴涕、1605、1059等农药。但是，在解放后，由于党的重视和我国农业科学工作者的努力，现在我国已能大量生产666、滴滴涕。今年又可以开始生产1605。1059的试制也已经获得成功。熏蒸棉籽杀虫用的溴化甲烷和棉种消毒用的西力生，我国也已能自己制造。在药械制造方面，从一九五○年起，我国就能生产七万多架喷雾器喷粉器。在一九五六年，每年制造能力已经达到一百万架以上。特别值得提出的是，自从一九五五年开始，我国已经试用飞机防治棉虫。这些成就在旧中国真是不可想像的事！
    统一分级，优级优价
    就棉花分级标准来讲，由于我国纺织业的发展，就需要有一套科学的原棉统一分级标准。在反动统治时代，这个问题研究了几十年，可是根本就没有见诸实行。解放后，由于党和政府的重视，在一九五○年就开始实行了一系列的棉花分级办法，公布了全国统一的“棉花分级标准”。这些办法和标准，在短短四年内，已在全国各初级棉花市场普遍贯彻执行，农民卖棉花能得到优级优价的好处。实行棉花标准最早的是美国，搞了四十一年，全国棉花标准才初步得到统一。到现在有了六十年，它的棉花标准还只能在中级棉花市场执行，也只是给中间商人从中取利，农民卖棉花得不到优级优价的好处。这就是社会主义制度和资本主义制度一个鲜明的对比；这就充分地说明了我国社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    棉花科学工作队伍逐步壮大
    在棉花科学工作的队伍中，解放后，也逐步壮大和发展起来。现在，全国有七个地区性的农业科学研究所，都在进行棉花试验研究工作。棉区各省、自治区的农业科学研究所、综合试验站以及棉花专业试验站，都在进行棉花科学研究工作。最近，中国农业科学院正在筹设全国性的棉花专业科学研究所。国家这样重视科学研究工作，右派分子竟说我们的科学工作不及反动的国民党时代，这是恶毒地诬蔑我们的党和全体的科学工作者。
    再回想一下我们一些科学工作者，在国民党反动统治时代的遭遇吧！以我自己为例：我于一九二七年在金陵大学毕业，后来又到美国留过学。当时一心想从事棉花研究工作，为我国棉花改进事业贡献一分力量。可是在国民党反动统治下，我的一点愿望完全落空了。反动政府是不关心怎样来发展我国的棉花生产。一个科学工作者，如果不靠派系活动，不靠人事关系，连一个工作也找不到。我在国民党时期，混了十九年，曾经失业过七次，调换工作十三次。在一个单位工作时间最长的是四年，最短的只有两个月，平均一年半就得调换一次工作，而且常常不让我做棉花科学工作。有一个时期，我竟在基督教青年会里当干事。像我这样的遭遇，在旧社会是不少的。请看一看我们今天的所有从事棉花工作技术人员是怎样呢！我们都能在一定的工作岗位上安心地进行工作，积极地为发展我国棉花科学和生产而努力。这就是新旧社会对待科学工作者一个鲜明的对照。在旧中国，一个科学工作者，连找一个从事科学工作的机会都很困难，试问这样的时代，科学怎么能发展起来呢？
    植棉科学技术工作需要进一步加强
    当然，我们并不说解放后几年来，我国棉花科学技术工作已经没有什么缺点了。缺点还是存在的。例如我们虽注意了棉花品种推广工作，但棉种混杂和退化现象还没有克服；对于克服棉花的自然灾害，特别是雨涝灾害的各种技术措施，还研究得不够；在棉花栽培技术方面，有的地区还不能很好地掌握因地制宜的原则。这些工作都是需要进一步加强研究和改进的。
    但是总的来讲，解放后，我国棉花科学技术改进事业的成绩是极其巨大的。仅就棉花产量而言：一九五五年，我国棉花皮棉总产量为三千零三十六万担，比一九四九年的八百八十八万担增加了两倍半，比解放前一九三六年我国棉花最高年总产量一千六百九十七万担，高出百分之八十以上。在棉花单位面积产量方面，一九五五年为皮棉三十五点一斤，比一九四九年的二十一点六斤，增加了百分之六十二点五。由于我国棉花产量和质量的迅速提高，已经根本扭转了解放前我国原棉依赖进口的情况。
    我上面所谈的，仅仅是我国棉花科学技术工作，在解放后八年来所取得的成就。在其他工业原料作物、粮食作物方面，以及农业科学的各个部门，也都已经同样地获得了巨大的成绩。这就充分地说明了党的重视科学、并且实际上能完全领导科学工作；也充分地证实了社会主义制度对发展科学技术工作是具有无比的优越性的。右派分子说：党不能领导科学技术工作，我们说：党是引导我们向科学进军的最英明的指挥者。右派分子想借此混淆是非，来实现他们的反党反社会主义的企图，是狂妄无知，我们必须坚决予以反击。
