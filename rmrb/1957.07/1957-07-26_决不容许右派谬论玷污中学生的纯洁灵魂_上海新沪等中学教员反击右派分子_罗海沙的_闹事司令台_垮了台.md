Absolutely No Rightist Fallacies Allowed to Taint the Pure Souls of Middle School Students
Teachers from Shanghai's New Shanghai and Other Middle Schools Counterattack Rightist Elements
Luo Haisha's "Troublemaking Command Post" Collapses
(Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai's New Shanghai Middle School, Times Middle School, Caoyang Middle School, Second Normal School, and First Accelerated Normal School recently held symposiums to counterattack the rightist elements Luo Haisha, Huang Jonsi, and others' conspiracy to attack the Party.

A common characteristic of these schools is that during the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," a few rightist elements tried their best to incite the masses to engage in "great democracy," attempting to disrupt the rectification process. For example, Luo Haisha, a teacher at New Shanghai Middle School and Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Hongkou District Preparatory Committee, engaged in behind-the-scenes activities, inciting disturbances, inviting the heads of the China Democratic League (CDL) and China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) in the school, and convening a joint meeting of democratic parties to plot the establishment of a "troublemaking command post" organization. He also wooed Zheng Baoding, a CDL member in the school, and jointly formulated "Ten Crimes, Ten Suggestions, and Three Attitudes," instructing Zheng to propose at the general meeting to "remove the Party branch, expel bad Party members (the branch secretary), and dismiss Principal Lu." It was revealed that Luo Haisha was originally a confidant of Chen Mingshu. When Chen Mingshu attacked the Party, he came to Shanghai for twenty-three days and met with Luo Haisha twenty-four times. After this newspaper published the editorial "Why Is This?", Luo colluded with another RCCK member to write a fake self-criticism for Chen Mingshu and arranged a secret meeting with Chen at Hongkou Park. Luo Haisha has consistently been anti-communist. Before the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the Blue Shirts Society and later served as a major general commissioner under the special agent Dai Li, and had close relations with the special agent chief Zheng Jiemin, copied blacklists, and monitored the activities of progressive elements.

Under the control of Huang Jonsi, the CAPD branch of Caoyang Middle School was opposed to the Party branch in every way during the "Blooming and Contending" period. It did not inform the Party branch of any activities, but tried every possible means to find out about the situation of the Party branch. Huang Jonsi openly stated: "Only violent storms can be used against Party members." He advocated the establishment of a so-called joint meeting of the two parties in the school, attempting to take turns leading the school with the Communist Party.

Liu Fei, a rightist element from Shanghai Second Normal School, once clamored at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference that he was "pleading for the lives of 50,000 primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai." This self-proclaimed "life pleader" recently revealed his true colors at a general meeting of all faculty and staff in the school. It turned out that Liu Fei was a political swindler and a "specialist" in setting fires everywhere.

Liu Fei once arrogantly clamored to "exonerate" counter-revolutionary elements; In order to accumulate anti-Party and anti-socialist capital, Liu Fei also pretended to be ordered by the Shanghai Education Bureau to go to many schools such as Shanghai Fourth Normal School, Siping Middle School, Pingliang Road Primary School, South Shanghai Middle School, and Yulin District First Primary and Secondary School to collect materials. In these schools, he specifically sought out counter-revolutionary elements who had been sentenced to imprisonment, people who had been expelled from the Communist Youth League, people who had been subjected to administrative punishment, and people who were dissatisfied with the Party and administration, and openly claimed that he and these people were "fellow sufferers." He also promised Li, the adopted daughter of the warlord Guan Linzheng and a confidante of Soong Mei-ling, to "redress her grievances." Li once fabricated a story saying that the leaders of Shidong Middle School had driven a staff member crazy, and this incident became a cannonball for Liu Fei to attack the Party.

Liu Fei not only impersonated a person appointed by the Municipal Education Bureau, but also impersonated "representatives" of Secretary Ke Qingshi, Deputy Mayor Liu Jiping, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the Central Group of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference, the Education Bureau and other units and individuals to carry out "fire" activities in many schools.

These schools are continuing to fight against these rightist elements, demanding that they thoroughly confess their conspiracies.

    决不容许右派谬论玷污中学生的纯洁灵魂
    上海新沪等中学教员反击右派分子
    罗海沙的“闹事司令台”垮了台
    本报讯　上海市新沪中学、时代中学、曹杨中学、第二师范、第一速成师范，最近分别举行座谈会，反击右派分子罗海沙、黄浚思等向党进攻的阴谋活动。
    这几个学校的共同特点是在大鸣大放期间，少数右派分子极力煽动群众搞大民主，企图打乱整风步骤。如新沪中学教员、民革虹口区筹委会副主任罗海沙，在幕后活动，煽动闹事，邀集该校民盟、民进负责人，开民主党派联席会议，策动成立“闹事司令台”组织，拉拢该校民盟盟员郑保定，共同商定“十大罪状，十项建议，三项态度”，指示郑在大会上提出要“撤换党支部，开除坏党员（支部书记），撤销陆校长职务。”据揭发，原来罗海沙是陈铭枢的亲信，当陈铭枢向党进攻的时候，曾来上海活动了二十三天，与罗海沙会面二十四次。在本报发表社论“这是为什么？”后，罗曾勾结民革另一成员为陈铭枢写假检讨，并约陈到虹口公园密商。罗海沙一贯反共，早在抗日战争以前就参加了复兴社，之后又在特务头子戴笠手下作过少将专员，并与特务头子郑介民关系密切，抄过黑名单，监视过进步分子的活动。
    曹杨中学民进支部在黄浚思把持下，在鸣放期间，处处和党支部对立，一切活动不让党支部知道，却千方百计打听党支部的情况。黄浚思并公然提出：“对党员只能狂风暴雨”。他主张要在学校里建立所谓两党联席会议，企图与共产党轮流来领导学校。
    上海市第二师范学校的右派分子刘非，曾在中共上海市委宣传会议上叫嚣他是“代表上海五万名中小学教师请命的”。这个自封的“请命者”，最近在该校全体教职员工大会上现出原形来了。原来刘非是个政治骗子，到处放火的“专家”。
    刘非曾狂妄地叫嚣要为反革命分子“洗雪”；刘非为了积累反党、反社会主义的资本，还假冒奉上海教育局长之命到过上海市第四师范学校、四平中学、平凉路小学、市南中学、榆林区第一中小学等许多学校去搜集材料，在这些学校里，专门找曾判过徒刑的反革命分子、被开除青年团团籍的人、受过行政处分的人、对党对行政不满的人交谈，并公开声称，自己和这些人“同是天涯沦落人”。他还答应军阀关麟征的过房女儿、宋美龄的亲信李某，要为她“洗雪不白之冤”。李某曾经捏造说市东中学领导把一个职员逼成神经病，这件事就成了刘非向党进攻的一颗炮弹。
    刘非不仅冒充市教育局长委派的人员，而且还到处冒充“代表”柯庆施书记、刘季平副市长、中共上海市委、市委宣传会议中心小组、教育局等单位和个人到许多学校里，进行放“火”活动。
    这几个学校正在继续对这些右派分子进行斗争，要他们彻底交代阴谋活动。
