Xinhua News Agency, July 1st. The Chinese Foreign Ministry today once again sent a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, lodging a strong protest and making demands regarding the Hong Kong British authorities sending thirty-five passengers from the "Baiteng" ship, including murderers and suspects, to Taiwan. The full text of the note is as follows:

    "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its compliments to the British Chargé d'Affaires and, with reference to the Ministry's note of June 21, 1957, and the Chargé d'Affaires' reply of June 24, 1957, concerning the hijacking of the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company's motorized junk "Baiteng", makes the following statement and request, which should be promptly conveyed to the British Government.

    The Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company's motorized junk "Baiteng" was violently hijacked by thugs mixed among the passengers at approximately 8:00 AM on June 12, 1957, while en route from Dan'gan Island to Tangjiawan, passing through the Chinese territorial waters of Mangzhou Island. After murdering a staff member on board, they forced the ship to sail to Hong Kong. The aforementioned facts have been confirmed by the public announcements issued by the Hong Kong British authorities on June 12th and June 23rd.

    Given that this criminal act of homicide occurred on a Chinese vessel and within Chinese territorial waters, the British Government and the Hong Kong British authorities should, in accordance with international practice and the requirements of the Ministry's note of June 21, 1957, assist in handing over the ship and all its staff and passengers to the relevant Chinese authorities for legal proceedings. However, on June 23, 1957, the Hong Kong British authorities released the ship and eleven staff and passengers, while sending thirty-five passengers, including murderers and suspects, to Taiwan under the guise of deportation.

    It should be pointed out that the action of the Hong Kong British authorities in sending the murderers and suspects, who should have been handed over to the relevant Chinese authorities for processing according to international practice, to Taiwan is, in effect, condoning the escape of murderers from justice, thereby obstructing the Chinese government's handling of this serious criminal case. The Chinese government lodges a strong protest against this blatant violation of international practice and extremely unfriendly behavior by the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, and firmly demands that the British government be responsible for handing over all personnel who have been sent to Taiwan, including murderers and suspects, to the relevant Chinese authorities. The Chinese government also declares that it reserves the right to make further demands regarding this incident."

    香港英当局放走劫夺“白腾号”的凶犯
    我外交部向英国再提严重抗议
    新华社1日讯　我外交部今天再度照会英国驻华代办处，对香港英国当局将“白腾号”上包括有关杀人凶犯和嫌疑犯在内的三十五名乘客送往台湾一事，提出严重抗议和要求。照会全文如下：
    “中华人民共和国外交部谨向英国代办处致意，并且就外交部1957年6月21日致代办处的照会和代办处1957年6月24日的复照关于广东省水产供销公司机帆船“白腾号”被劫驶去香港一事，提出以下声明和要求，请即转达英国政府。
    广东省水产供销公司机帆船“白腾号”在1957年6月12日晨八时左右，在从担杆岛开往唐家湾途中驶经芒洲岛中国领海的时候，突被混在乘客中的暴徒用暴力劫夺，将船上一工作人员杀害后强迫该船驶去香港。上述事实已经为6月12日和6月23日香港英国当局发表的公报所证实。
    鉴于这项杀害人命的犯罪行为是在中国船只上和在中国领海内发生的事实，英国政府和香港英国当局理应按照国际惯例，根据外交部1957年6月21日照会中的要求，协助将该船和船上全部工作人员和乘客交由中国有关当局领回，以便依法审理。但是，香港英国当局1957年6月23日却反将该船和船上工作人员和乘客十一人放回，而将包括有关杀害人命的凶犯和嫌疑犯在内的三十五名乘客在驱逐出境名义下送往台湾。
    应该指出，香港英国当局把按照国际惯例理应交由中国有关当局领回处理的有关杀人凶犯和嫌疑犯送往台湾的这种做法，实际上是纵容杀人凶犯逃脱法网，从而妨碍中国政府对这一严重刑事案件的处理。中国政府对英国政府和香港英国当局这种公然违反国际惯例和极不友好的行为提出严重抗议，并且坚决要求英国政府负责将已经被送往台湾的包括有关杀人凶犯和嫌疑犯在内的全部人员交回中国有关当局。中国政府并声明保留对这一事件提出进一步要求的权利。”
