    Syria Prepares to Aid Omani Uprising People
    U.S. Conceals Factors of Anglo-American Oil Struggle in Oman Incident

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 27th. The "Masses Daily" reported on the 26th that Syria is prepared to provide financial and military aid to the Omani people who are engaged in a struggle against imperialism.
    Acting President Kudsi presided over a meeting on the 25th to discuss the Oman issue. Prime Minister Asali and Foreign Minister Bitar attended the meeting.
    The "Masses Daily" stated that in the past twenty-four hours, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar has been continuously contacting the capitals of Arab countries and foreign diplomatic representatives in Syria to discuss the situation in Oman.
    Senior political figures here revealed on the 25th that the Arab countries' delegation to the United Nations has been instructed to hold meetings with representatives of Asian and African countries to discuss the issue of Oman being invaded and to notify the United Nations of the dangerous situation created by Britain in Oman.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the Oman incident on July 26th.
    After U.S. officials had continuously denied for several days that the incident had any "connection" with the U.S., and denied that any American weapons had been transported into the region, the statement said, "The United States has not received specific reports regarding news of the discovery of foreign weapons in the area; however, it is not surprising that the tribes there obtain weapons from abroad."
    The statement once again conceals the factors of the struggle for oil interests between the U.S. and Britain in this incident.
    According to Agence France-Presse, London sources believe that this "oil war" between British and American companies has never truly stopped; however, the uprising against British imperialism that broke out in Oman has made this war even more acute. The real target of the battle appears to be the Buraimi Oasis and the British protectorates along the Persian Gulf coast. Beyond these protectorates are the British-controlled oil fields of Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. According to some, the Buraimi Oasis, located between the Sultanate of Oman and these protectorates, is of great strategic importance: whoever occupies it is the master of the Persian Gulf coast.

    叙利亚准备援助阿曼起义人民
    美国掩饰阿曼事件含有英美石油斗争的因素
    新华社大马士革27日电　据“群众报”26日报道，叙利亚准备对正在进行反对帝国主义斗争的阿曼人民提供财政和军事援助。
    代理总统库德西25日主持举行了会议，讨论阿曼问题，总理阿萨利和外交部长比塔尔出席了会议。
      “群众报”说，在过去二十四小时中，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔不断地同阿拉伯各国首都和驻叙利亚的各国外交代表进行接触，讨论阿曼局势问题。
    这里的高级政界人士25日透露说，阿拉伯国家驻联合国代表团已奉命同亚非国家代表举行会议，讨论阿曼受到侵略的问题，并且把英国在阿曼造成的危险局势通知联合国。
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院7月26日就阿曼事件发表了一篇声明。
    在美国官方连续好几天矢口否认这个事件同美国有“牵连”，否认有美国武器运进这个地区以后，这篇声明里说，“关于这个地区发现外国武器的消息，美国没有得到具体的报告；但是那里的部落从国外得到武器是无足为奇的。”
    声明再次掩饰这个事件中有着美英争夺石油权益的斗争的因素。
    据法新社报道，伦敦人士认为，主要是英国公司和美国公司之间的这场“石油战争”，从来没有真正停止过，不过，在阿曼爆发的反对英帝国主义的起义，使这场战争更加尖锐了。战斗的真正目标，看来是布赖米绿洲和波斯湾沿岸的英国保护国。越过这些保护国，就是英国控制的卡塔尔、巴林和科威特的油田。据某些人说，位于阿曼苏丹和这些保护国之间的布赖米绿洲，具有非常重要的战略意义：谁占领了它谁就是波斯湾沿岸的主人。
