A Dirty Bunch
——Some "Old Accounts" of Several Key Figures in the Shanghai Rightist Group
By Our Reporters Zhang Jing and Ji Yin
The Shanghai Rightist Group's conspiracy, under the leadership of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, to subvert socialism has been initially exposed. Their series of planned sabotage activities against the Communist Party, the people, and socialism have been brought to light in the newspapers.

Some people ask: What kind of people are these Rightist figures? Why do they hate socialism so deeply? Why do they hate the people and the Communist Party so intensely? To help readers understand this, we will now introduce the backgrounds of these Rightist elements. Chen Renbing, a minor leader of the Shanghai Rightist elements, once wanted to settle "old accounts" with the Communist Party. Well then, let us now settle their "old accounts."

When we open the old accounts of these Rightist elements, we find page after page of ugly, bloody records. It turns out that in the era of imperialism and Kuomintang reactionary rule, most of these people were accomplices of various kinds. Among them were executioners who directly participated in the massacre of the working people, news censors who wielded the vermilion pen to carry out cultural and ideological slaughter, cultural secret agents who drafted "suppression of rebellion declarations," and Kuomintang officials who amassed fortunes of tens of thousands in their three years in office. In short, their accounts record many blood debts owed to the working people of our country.

Counter-revolutionary Strategists, Executioners Who Massacred the People

In the Shanghai Rightist elements' frenzied attack on the Party, Yang Zhaolong of Fudan University took the lead in attacking socialist legality. He repeatedly and blindly slandered our country for having no legal system, and lavishly praised the Kuomintang's "Six Codes." Why does this self-proclaimed jurist so venomously hate the people's legal system of New China? After we examined his old accounts, we understood. It turns out that before liberation, Yang Zhaolong was a Kuomintang prosecutor specifically used to deal with revolutionaries, a disciple cultivated by the reactionary American jurist Pound. As early as twenty years ago, he greatly admired the "good legislative spirit" of Italian fascist leader Mussolini. In an article entitled "The Significance and Value of Party-Oriented Justice," he offered the Kuomintang the strategy of implementing "party-oriented justice." Later, he sat on the bloody chairs of the chief prosecutor of the Kuomintang Supreme Court and the director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Justice, directly participating in the killing of Communist Party members and patriotic people. Communist Party member Wang Xiaohe was killed under his signature.

Among the Shanghai Rightist elements, there were more Kuomintang cultural secret agents, strategists, and lackeys. Xu Zhongnian was such a figure. Amid the clamor of the Shanghai Rightist elements, Xu Zhongnian uttered the most unpleasant crowing sound. In an article "A Crow Cries at Noon," he cursed Communist Party members as "living treasures wearing 'fortune upon seeing' hats in the Yama's palace," as "demons and monsters," using the most vicious words.

We checked Xu Zhongnian's old accounts and learned that his hatred for the Communist Party did not start now, but has been around for a long time. As early as 1933, he was a major general in the Kuomintang's secret service cultural organization, a guest of Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, Zhang Daofan, and other reactionary Kuomintang leaders. He participated in the "China Literary Society" run by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, served as the editor-in-chief of the "Literary Monthly," a publication of the "China Literary Society," and held key positions in other Kuomintang and Three People's Principles Youth League propaganda publications. In 1941, he was formally admitted to the Kuomintang as a "special member" on the recommendation of Wu Zhihui and Zhang Daofan, and served as an executive committee member and propaganda section chief of the Kuomintang Central University Directly Subordinate District Party Department, as well as a director of the Kuomintang "Central Cultural Movement Committee." He met with Zhang Daofan once a week to receive Zhang's instructions.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Xu Zhongnian became an even more active pawn on the anti-communist front. In December 1945, the Kuomintang secret service organization organized a "Chongqing Cultural Circle Symposium" in Chongqing, under the guise of the cultural circle to attack the Communist Party. He served as the chairman of this symposium. Fang Zhi, the Kuomintang secret service leader, specially sent eighty plainclothes thugs to protect him as he ascended the podium. Xu Zhongnian played a secret service role at the meeting. He gave a speech that reversed black and white, saying that the Communist Party was "a bunch of scum," "mad and insane," "shouting democracy but actually acting feudal; shouting unity but actually plotting division; constantly shouting no civil war, but actually launching internal strife; plunging the country and the people into deep water and misery, and still showing no signs of repentance, but intensifying and expanding the chaos." Xu Zhongnian's anti-communist speech was published in the Kuomintang Central Daily News after the meeting. The secret service leader Fang Zhi praised his speech as "very good."

After the Kuomintang launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, Xu Zhongnian actively responded to the Kuomintang reactionaries' "suppression of rebellion mobilization order." On August 30, 1947, he also participated in the Shanghai cultural circle's "suppression of rebellion mobilization conference" and participated in drafting the "suppression of rebellion declaration," using the most curse-filled words against the Communist Party. But cursing was not his only skill. When necessary, he could also sing praises. For example, in his novel "As the Law Prescribes," he once praised Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he was a "kind-hearted man." This is Xu Zhongnian's love and hate.

Let's take another look: some other figures in the Shanghai Rightist Group, their accounts almost all have such an unsavory dirty account. Chen Renbing, a key member of the Shanghai Rightist elements, deputy director and secretary-general of the Shanghai Democratic League, has always touted himself as "progressive," but recently people have exposed his mask. He has always been hand-in-glove with Kong Xiangxi, who pulled him into the Ministry of Finance as a commissioner for seven or eight years. He also had secret dealings with Zhao Wang, a secret agent of the Kuomintang secret service organization "Blue Shirts Society," for a long time. Before and after the liberation of Shanghai, he first helped this secret agent join the "Democratic League," and then sneaked into the China National Import and Export Corporation Shanghai Branch, until he was arrested by the public security department in 1954.

"Philanthropists" Who Greedily Oppress the People

The Shanghai Rightist elements, in this attack on the Party, suddenly became a group of compassionate philanthropists. They constantly complained for the grassroots workers and peasants, as if they were the only ones who cared about the lives of the workers and peasants. Among them, the loudest was Wang Zaoshi. At the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference, he cried out that the "focus of blooming and contending should be placed at the grassroots level," saying that "the grassroots masses have grievances they cannot express."

Are Wang Zaoshi and his ilk really such philanthropists? A group of former employees of the "Qianfang Daily" in Jiangxi recently published an indictment letter in Shanghai newspapers, thoroughly stripping off the disguise of these philanthropists.

The employees said in their letter: "At that time, no matter how soaring the prices were, Wang Zaoshi never considered increasing the workers' wages even a little. Once, workers at several newspaper offices in Ji'an City went on strike, demanding wage increases. Wang Zaoshi insisted on not agreeing, and called the pseudo-police chief, who summoned police and secret agents late at night to force the workers to return to work. Workers Liang Guangsheng and others were arrested by him and detained for two days because they did not go to work."

"Wang Zaoshi often personally went to the workers' dormitories to shout at the workers to get up and go to work. If anyone got up a little late, Wang Zaoshi would knock them on the head with his cane. Wang Zaoshi treated apprentices and odd-job workers even more cruelly. The apprentices' work was more arduous than that of the formal workers. In the cold winter nights, they still had to walk barefoot in the snow to wash the machines with water. However, the apprentices had not worn a new pair of socks for three years, except for haircuts and some coarse food. He also said that people should thank him..."

The employees of the former "Freedom Publishing House" in Shanghai recently also exposed many facts about the boss Wang Zaoshi's greedy exploitation of workers. The employees said: Wang Zaoshi "usually did not care about the difficulties in the lives of the employees. As soon as he saw that there was money in the company, he immediately tried to withdraw it, even when the publishing house was heavily in debt and unable to maintain itself. Two employees advanced 3,800 yuan in cash, but Wang Zaoshi, against his conscience, tried to use this advance to offset his personal back wages. After the socialist transformation movement of private industrial and commercial enterprises, Wang Zaoshi did not pay a cent of back wages to all the employees, but he himself pocketed more than 600 yuan. When the last batch of books was acquired by Xinhua Bookstore, Wang Zaoshi still greedily pocketed another 200 yuan from it. He also borrowed 5,000 yuan from the People's Bank in the name of the enterprise, which fell into his private pocket and refused to repay it. He has always adopted a contemptuous attitude towards the working class's supervision of the enterprise. All the employees and the management department believed that taxes should be paid first, and then wages should be paid. Wang Zaoshi insisted on not agreeing, and slammed the publishing house manager with a set square."

Look, Wang Zaoshi, who talks loudly about "caring about the people's suffering," is such a greedy and lawless capitalist.

We might as well mention another scandal of Peng Wenyin, a key member of the Rightists and deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Democratic League. Before liberation, Peng Wenyin relied on the signboard of Qian Dajun, the Kuomintang mayor of Shanghai, claiming to represent the "China International Problem Research Association," and attempted to seize a building at No. 1184 North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. The original old tenant of this house was surnamed Zhou. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the tenant surnamed Zhou moved back to open a shop in accordance with legal procedures, and a family of fifteen depended on this shop for a living. However, Peng Wenyin took a fancy to this house and, regardless of the life and death of others, threatened him several times, insisting that the tenant surnamed Zhou give him the house. The tenant surnamed Zhou refused. Peng Wenyin personally led dozens of thugs to the shop of the tenant surnamed Zhou and beat him violently, smashing the shop to pieces. One of the thugs even drew a pistol, forcing the tenant surnamed Zhou to immediately give up the house. In the end, the tenant surnamed Zhou had to give up half of the house.

In the old accounts of the Shanghai Rightist elements, we can cite many more things about greedily oppressing the working people.

A Bloodsucker Who Was "Wealthy After Three Years in Office"

The common language used by the Rightist elements this time to attack the Communist Party is that "the Communist Party has become divorced from the masses and has lost popular support." They wantonly exaggerate certain shortcomings in our work, describing today's society as "dark and sunless," "harming the people." They arrogantly want the Communist Party to "step down," "get off the sedan chair," and let them take over.

But, let's see how this gang of people was "loving the people like children" and "deeply supported by the people" in the past? Xia Gaoyang, a member of the Shanghai Rightist Group, served as a "county magistrate" in Wenling, Zhejiang, from 1940 to 1943. His "virtuous administration" is almost known to everyone in Wenling, and the people still have lingering resentment to this day. He used various deceptive means to plunder large quantities of land and salt fields from farmers and salt workers, and auctioned them off to landlords and gentry at low prices, profiting from it. He also used the method of catching, talking, and releasing to implement his "benevolent government" of "banning" bandits and "banning" opium, but in fact, no matter how great the crime, money was the only truth. As a result, the number of bandits in Wenling increased despite the "ban," and they could even openly enter the towns in broad daylight to loot.

Wenling has many folk songs "praising" this "County Magistrate Xia," such as:

Huang Xianjin (a pirate who ran rampant along the Zhejiang coast at the time),
His power is great,
Gaoyang is his family;
Opium and heroin are smuggled in,
The county magistrate sits and shares the loot.

Xia Gaoyang, black-hearted, catches conscripts, scrapes field rations;
It's not to fight the Japanese to resist Japan, what kind of deeds are bright.

The result of Xia Gaoyang's three years of rule in Wenling was that he turned a place rich in products, worthy of being called a land of fish and rice, into a place where people were struggling to survive and the sight was desolate, while he himself was "wealthy," and when he left office, he brought back twenty loads of personal luggage. As the folk song describes:

Xia Gaoyang, has the ability, buys and sells conscripts and gets rich;
When he came, he was a "poor scholar," when he left, he became a wealthy man Xia "Wan Cai."

Xia Gaoyang came, the people suffered,
His pockets are full of gold and silver; ten thousand taels.

People Soaked in the Poison of the Exploiting Class

Keen interest in personal fame and gain is a common characteristic of the Rightist elements throughout history. Before liberation, for this purpose, they did not hesitate to be humble and ingratiating, flattering and fawning, drilling everywhere, and playing double-dealing tactics. Their history is a history of despicable pursuit of fame and gain.

Here we want to take the Rightist element Sun Dayu as an example. Sun Dayu has always posed as a "progressive professor," but in this massive anti-Rightist struggle, the masses stripped off his disguise and revealed his true colors. It turns out that Sun Dayu joined the Kuomintang as early as 1942, and relied on Sun Ke and Zhang Daofan, participating in translating Chiang Kai-shek's fascist work "China's Destiny." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he wanted to seek a position as president of a normal college, desperately pleasing Chen Xueping, the leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League. Later, his purpose of getting promoted and making a fortune was not achieved, so Luo Longji introduced him to join the Democratic League, but at the same time, he also joined the reactionary organization "International Cultural Association" initiated by Zhu Jiahua, the Kuomintang Minister of Education, stepping on two boats, leaning towards whichever side was more beneficial.

People exposed Sun Dayu's love for profit and selfishness to an astonishing degree. He wrote a book of more than 100,000 words, "On Poetry," which the editor of Xinwenyi Publishing House said was "idealism plus formalism," but he said that his articles were "weighted in every word," and insisted that the publishing house publish it at a rate of 30 yuan per thousand words and a minimum quota. In the end, because the publishing house did not agree, it was forced to be calculated at 18 yuan per thousand words, which is still the publishing house's current highest royalty rate. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, he pretended to be sick at home all day and did not attend meetings. The school called him several times to go to the school, and each time his wife refused. Coincidentally, the journal editorial department also called at the same time to notify him to settle the manuscript fee. Sun Dayu, who was next to the telephone, immediately jumped up when he heard the word "manuscript fee," picked up the microphone and said: "My article has 36,790 words, how much money you should give me, I can also tell you..." Such a greedy Sun Dayu was extremely mean to others, even to his own mother, wife, and children. Before liberation, Sun Dayu was able to be allocated two portions of kerosene. If his mother wanted to use some, he would have to ask his own mother to take money to buy it from him at the market price. Now, he has a salary of more than 300 yuan per month, and his wife is a primary school teacher with very little income, but he insisted that his wife share the expenses equally with him at home, refusing to take out one more yuan for the family.

The above is only a part of the old accounts of several key figures in the Shanghai Rightist Group. Based on the generous policy of not blaming the past, the Communist Party and the People's Government did not settle these accounts with them after liberation. Now that they want to "settle the old accounts" with the Party and the people, then let's settle them together.

    肮脏的一群
    ——记上海右派集团几个主要人物的一些“旧账”
    本报记者　张竞、季音
    上海右派集团在章罗联盟领导下企图颠覆社会主义的阴谋，已经初步暴露了，他们反共、反人民和反社会主义的一系列有计划的破坏活动，已经在报端大白于世了。
    有人问道：这些右派人物是些什么人物呢？他们为什么这样刻骨地仇视社会主义？这样刻骨地仇视人民和共产党？为了让读者们了解这一点，现在我们就来介绍一下这些右派分子的来历。上海右派分子的小头目陈仁炳曾经要同共产党算一算“旧账”，那末好吧，现在我们就来给这些先生们算一算他们的“旧账”。
    当我们翻开这些右派分子的旧账，满篇是丑恶的血腥的纪录。原来这些人在帝国主义和国民党反动统治时期，大多是各式各样的帮凶，其中有直接参与屠杀劳动人民的刽子手，有手拿朱笔进行文化思想杀戮的新闻检查官，有起草“戡乱宣言”的文化特务，有上任三载、腰缠万贯的国民党官员，……总之在他们的账面上，记着许多笔我国劳动人民的血债。
    反革命的谋士，屠杀人民的刽子手
    在上海右派分子向党的猖狂进攻中，复旦大学杨兆龙担任了向社会主义法制进攻的先锋，他闭着眼一再地诬蔑说我国没有法制，对国民党的“六法全书”大加赞赏。为什么这位自封的法学家对新中国人民的法制如此毒恨？当我们查了他的旧账之后，便明白了。原来杨兆龙解放前就是国民党专门用来对付革命者的检察官，是美国反动法学家庞德培养出来的门生。远在二十年前，他就十分赞赏意大利法西斯头子墨索里尼的“立法精神好”，在一篇题为“党化司法的意义与价值”的文章中，他向国民党献策实行“党化司法”。以后，他坐上了国民党最高法院首席检察官、司法部刑事司司长这把充满血腥气的交椅，就直接参与了杀害共产党员和爱国人士。共产党员王孝和，就是在他签字之下，被杀害的。
    在上海右派分子中，更多的是国民党的文化特务、谋士、走卒之流，徐仲年就是这末一个人物。在上海右派分子的一片叫嚣中，徐仲年叫出了一阵最难听的乌鸦声。他在一篇“乌昼啼”的文章中，骂共产党员是“阎罗殿上戴着‘一见生财’的帽子的活宝”，是“牛鬼蛇神”，用尽恶毒的字眼。
    我们查了一下徐仲年的旧账，才知道他仇视共产党并不从现在开始，而是由来已久了。远在1933年，他就是国民党特务文化机构中的一员大将，是陈立夫、叶楚伧、张道藩这些国民党反动头子的座上客，他参加过国民党中宣部办的“中国文艺社”，担任过“中国文艺社”的刊物“文艺月报”的主编，以及其他国民党和三青团御用刊物的要职。1941年，他由吴稚辉和张道藩介绍正式参加国民党为“特别党员”，并担任国民党中央大学直属区党部执委、宣传股长等“要职”，和国民党“中央文化运动委员会”的理事，他和张道藩每星期都要见一次面，接受张的指示。
    抗战胜利后，徐仲年更积极地成了反共战线上的一名走卒。1945年12月，国民党特务组织在重庆组织了一个“陪都文化界座谈会”，假借文化界的名义来攻击共产党，他就担任了这个座谈会的主席，国民党特务头子方治特地派了八十个便衣打手保护着他登上了主席台。徐仲年在会上完全扮演了一个特务角色，他发表了一篇颠倒黑白的演说，说共产党是“败类分子”，“丧心病狂”，“口里喊民主，实际行动是封建；口里喊团结，事实是谋分裂；口里不住的喊不要内战，实际是在发动内乱；重陷国家人民于水深火热之中，至今还毫无悔改之意，且变本加厉，扩大祸乱。”徐仲年的这篇反共演说会后即在国民党中央日报上发表，对他的演说，特务头子方治连声称赞“很好”。
    国民党对解放区的大规模进攻开始后，徐仲年积极响应国民党反动派的“戡乱动员令”，1947年8月30日，他还参加了上海文化界“戡乱动员大会”，并且参加起草“戡乱宣言”，对共产党用尽了咒骂的字眼。但咒骂并不是他的唯一本领，必要的时候也能歌唱，例如他写的小说“如法泡制”里，就曾歌唱过蒋介石，说他是“蔼然仁者”。——这就是徐仲年的爱和憎。
    我们再来看看：上海右派集团的一些其他人物，他们的账面上几乎都有着这样一笔见不得人的肮脏账。上海右派分子骨干、上海民盟副主任兼秘书长陈仁炳，一向标榜“进步”，但最近人们揭穿了他的假面具，他过去一直和孔祥熙勾勾搭搭，由孔祥熙拉进财政部做了七、八年专员。他还长期以来和国民党特务组织“蓝衣社”的一个特务赵望有密交，上海解放前后，他首先帮助这个特务加入了“民盟”，以后就钻进了中国进出口公司上海分公司，到1954年才被公安部门逮捕。
    贪婪地压榨人民的“慈善家”
    上海的右派分子在这次向党的进攻中，突然都变成了一批悲天悯人的慈善家，他们不断地为基层工人农民叫苦，仿佛只有他们最关心工农的生活。其中叫得最响的是王造时，他在上海市委宣传会议上疾呼，要“把鸣放重点放到基层去”，说什么“基层群众有苦说不出”。
    王造时之流真是这样的慈善家么？前江西“前方日报”的一群职工，最近在上海报纸上发表了一封控诉信，彻底地剥下了这些慈善家们的伪装。
    职工们的信中说：“当时，无论物价怎样飞涨，王造时从不考虑增加工人一点点工资。有一次，吉安市几个报社的工人罢工，要求增加工资，王造时坚持不答允，并打电话给伪警察局长，深夜叫来警察、特务，强迫工人上工。工人梁广生等就因为不上工，被他叫警察抓去扣押了两天。”
    “王造时还常常亲自到工人宿舍里，喊工人起床上工，谁要起慢一点，王造时就用手杖敲他的头。……王造时对待学徒、勤杂工，则更为残酷。学徒的工作比正式工人更繁重，严冬深夜还要赤脚在雪地里进进出出用水洗机器，可是，学徒除了理发和吃一点粗饭外，三年没有穿过一双新袜子，他还说人家应该感谢他。……”
    上海前“自由出版社”的职工，最近也揭发了老板王造时贪婪地剥削工人的许多事实，职工们说：王造时“平时对职工的生活困难毫不在意，一看到社里有钱，就马上设法支取，甚至在出版社负债累累、无法维持的时候也如此，有两名职工垫出三千八百元现款，王造时竟昧着良心企图把这笔垫款抵作他个人的欠薪。到了私营工商业社会主义改造运动以后，王造时对所有职工的欠薪分文不发，自己却捞进了六百余元，等到最后一批书籍由新华书店收购，王造时还贪得无厌地从中又捞进二百元。……他还用企业的名义向人民银行借了五千元，落入私人腰包，抵赖不还；对工人阶级监督企业，一贯采取蔑视态度，全体职工和经理部都认为应该先缴税款，再发工资，王造时坚持不答允，用三角尺猛击出版社经理。”……
    请看口口声声“关心群众疾苦”的王造时，就是这样一个贪婪无比的不法资本家。
    我们不妨再说右派骨干、民盟上海市委副主任委员彭文应的一件丑事。解放前，彭文应依靠国民党上海市长钱大钧的牌头，自称代表“中国国际问题研究会”，企图霸占上海北四川路一一八四号的一幢房屋。这间房屋原来的老房客姓周，抗日胜利后，姓周的按照合法手续重新搬回开店营业，一家十五口靠这爿店过活，但是彭文应看中了这爿房子，不顾别人死活，几次威吓，硬要姓周的把房屋让给他，姓周的不肯，彭文应便亲自率领了打手数十名，到姓周的店里大打出手，把店铺打得稀烂，有一个暴徒还拔出手枪，威逼姓周的立即让出房屋，最后姓周的只得让出一半房屋。
    上海右派分子们的的旧账中，这些贪婪地压榨劳动人民的事情，我们还可以举出很多。
    “上任三载，腰缠万贯”的吸血鬼
    右派分子这次用以攻击共产党的共同语言就是“共产党已经脱离群众，不得人心了。”他们肆意夸大我们工作中的某些缺点，把今天的社会形容得“暗无天日”，“危害万民”。狂妄地要共产党“下台”、“下轿”，让他们来接班。
    可是，请看看他们这帮人过去是怎样“爱民如子”“深得人心”的呢？上海右派集团的一分子夏高阳，从1940到1943年，就曾在浙江温岭当过三年“县太爷”，他的“德政”，在温岭几乎是路人皆知的，人民到今天犹有余恨。他用种种欺骗手段，掠夺农民和盐民的大批土地和盐田，低价拍卖给地主豪绅，从中渔利。他又用边抓、边谈、边放的手法，施行他“禁”盗匪，“禁”烟毒的“仁政”，实际上是无论罪恶多大，有钱就有理，结果温岭的盗匪越“禁”越多，甚至可以浩浩荡荡的白日开入城镇大肆抢劫。
    温岭有许多民谣“歌颂”这位“夏县长”，如：
    黄献金（当时横行浙江沿海的海盗），
    势力大，
    高阳本是他一家；
    鸦片白粉走私来，
    坐地分赃县太爷。
    夏高阳，黑心肠，抓壮丁，刮田粮；
    不是抗日打东洋，干的什么勾当自明亮。
    夏高阳在温岭统治三年的结果，把一个物产丰盛，堪称鱼米之乡的地方，搞得民不聊生，满目荒凉，而他自己却是“腰缠万贯”，下任时，竟带了二十担随身箱笼满载而归。正如民谣所形容的：
    夏高阳，有能耐，买卖壮丁发横财；
    来时“穷秀才”，去时成了富翁夏“万财”。
    来了夏高阳，百姓遭灾殃，
    腰包金银满；万两。
    浸透了剥削阶级毒汁的人
    热衷于个人的功名利禄，是右派分子们历史上的一个共同特点。解放前，他们为此目的，不惜卑躬屈膝，阿谀奉迎，到处钻营，耍两面手段，他们的历史，就是这样一部卑鄙地追求功名利禄的历史。
    这里我们要以右派分子孙大雨作例子。孙大雨一向以“进步教授”自居，但是，这次声势浩大的反右派斗争中，群众剥下了他的伪装，显出了原形。原来孙大雨早在1942年就加入了国民党，投靠孙科和张道藩，参加翻译蒋介石的法西斯著作“中国之命运”。抗战胜利后，他想谋取一个师范专科学校校长的职位，拼命讨好三青团头子陈雪屏，以后他的升官发财目的没有达到，就由罗隆基介绍加入了民盟，但同时又加入国民党教育部长朱家骅发起的反动组织“国际文化协会”，脚踏两头船，那边有利就往那边倒。
    人们揭发孙大雨的好利与自私，也到了惊人的程度。他写了一本十多万字的“诗论”，据新文艺出版社编辑说他的书是“唯心主义加形式主义”，但他说他的文章是
  “字字有份量”，硬要出版社按三十元一千字的稿费和最低定额来出版，最后因出版社不同意，被迫以十八元一千字计算，而这仍是出版社现行的最高稿费。反右派斗争展开后，他整日装病在家，不参加会议，学校几次打电话要他到校，每次都由他妻子回绝了，凑巧有一次学报编辑部也同时打电话通知他结算稿费，在电话机旁边的孙大雨，一听到“稿费”两个字，立即一跃而起，接过话筒说：“我那篇文章是三万六千七百九十多个字，要给我多少钱我也可以告诉你……。”如此贪财的孙大雨，对人却刻薄到极点，甚至对自己的母亲妻儿也不例外。解放前，孙大雨一个人能配给到两份火油，他母亲要用一些，他就要自己母亲按照市价拿钱来向他买。现在，他每个月有三百多元薪水，他妻子是小学教员，收入很少，但是他在家用上硬要妻子与他平均负担，不肯给家庭多拿出一元钱。
    上边所说的，仅仅是上海右派集团中几个主要人物的一部分旧账。这些账，共产党和人民政府本着既往不咎的宽大政策，解放后，并未向他们算过，现在他们既然要向党和人民“算一算旧账”，那么就一起来算一算吧。
