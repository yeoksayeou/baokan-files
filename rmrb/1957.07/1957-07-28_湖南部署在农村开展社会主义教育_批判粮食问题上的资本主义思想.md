    Hunan Deploys Socialist Education in Rural Areas
    Criticizes Capitalist Ideologies on Grain Issues
    Changsha Dispatch, July 27th (Reporter Huang Yubai) – The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at a telephone conference of local Party committee secretaries on July 25th, instructed all localities to conduct a renewed socialist education among peasants regarding the grain issue. This education should ensure peasants correctly understand the current grain situation and its problems, overcome the thought of excessively and rapidly raising grain consumption levels, properly carry out early and mid-season rice pre-distribution work, and strive for an overall bumper harvest.
    In recent months, a noteworthy situation has emerged in Hunan's rural grain work. Grain sales in rural areas are higher than in 1954, when the province suffered severe flooding, yet a significant number of people in rural areas are claiming they do not have enough grain. Some wealthy peasants, dissatisfied with socialism, are clamoring about grain shortages. Some are engaging in grain speculation, undermining the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in various ways. Others are exploiting the current public concern about the summer harvest pre-distribution, spreading rumors that "the commune is keeping too little grain," and even saying, "This year, we will eat our fill and use enough before selling grain to the state."
    According to statistics from relevant departments in Hunan Province, the amount of grain purchased by the state has decreased year by year in recent years, while the amount of grain supplied to rural areas has increased year by year. Grain consumed by farmers throughout the province was 16.7 billion jin in 1953, increasing to 16.8 billion jin in 1954, then to 18.1 billion jin in 1955. Even in 1956, despite a major drought, it was still over 18 billion jin, with an average per capita consumption of 565 jin, 89 jin more than the highest consumption level in 1936 before liberation. Therefore, overall, the grain situation is good, and the grain consumption level of farmers is increasing year by year. However, because production cannot keep up with the growth in demand, coupled with unplanned grain consumption by some people and shortcomings in grain work, varying degrees of grain shortages have emerged in some areas. According to investigations and understandings from various places, the current widespread and serious problem is the thinking of some people who want to increase grain consumption levels too quickly and excessively. These people always want to keep and sell more grain in grain distribution, and they always want to eat and use more grain in grain use. Many people have not paid attention to conservation, and there is much waste. More grain is being used to feed pigs, which affects food grain. This is a major loophole in the current rural grain work.
    The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized that all localities must conscientiously organize forces, combine current production and pre-distribution work, and conduct a renewed socialist education among the masses of peasants, launching a socialist debate on the grain issue. Educate peasants to correctly understand the state's grain work and rural grain issues, explaining that our country's grain production situation is good, but not very abundant, and that as long as the distribution is reasonable, it will be enough to eat and use. If production is not good, purchases and sales are improper, and grain is wasted, there will be problems. In order to rationally distribute grain and do a good job in this year's grain purchase and early and mid-season rice pre-distribution, the Provincial Committee instructed all localities that this year's "three fixings" (fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales) will remain unchanged, and individual production quotas that are too high can be appropriately adjusted. Within the commune, in addition to continuing to implement the principle of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work, the standard for retaining grain in rural areas will henceforth be implemented by "dividing households into grades, evaluating and quantifying, and unified arrangement by the commune," and basic food grain will be distributed according to the size of the population. Regarding pig feed, in addition to increasing private plots for farmers according to regulations, it is necessary to help farmers make good annual rotational plans for their private plots, and use idle land and lake and pond surfaces to grow green fodder, supplemented by collecting wild fodder, to achieve complete self-sufficiency in feed.
    In order to conserve grain, the Provincial Committee requires all localities to help commune members formulate grain conservation plans after the pre-distribution. For individual households with serious waste, the agricultural cooperative can appropriately implement planned management after the grain is distributed.

### 湖南部署在农村开展社会主义教育  批判粮食问题上的资本主义思想

    湖南部署在农村开展社会主义教育
    批判粮食问题上的资本主义思想
    本报长沙27日电　记者黄驭白报道：中共湖南省委在7月25日召开的各地委书记电话会议上，指示各地在粮食问题上对农民进行一次社会主义的再教育。教育农民正确认识当前粮食情况和问题，克服过高过急地提高用粮水平的思想，做好早中稻预分工作，力争全面丰收。
    近几个月来，湖南农村粮食工作上出现了一种值得特别注意的情况。农村的粮食销售量比遭受大水灾的1954年还要多，但农村中叫喊粮食不够的却为数不少。一些对社会主义不满的富裕农民，到处借口叫嚣缺粮。有的大搞粮食投机活动，从各方面破坏国家粮食统购统销政策。有的更利用目前群众关心夏收预分的心理，到处放出空气，说“社里留粮标准太低”，甚至说“今年要等我们自己吃饱了，用够了，再把粮食卖给国家。”
    据湖南省有关部门的统计，几年来，国家征购的粮食逐年减少，而供应给农村的粮食逐年增加。全省农民食用的粮食，1953年是一百六十七亿斤，1954年增加到一百六十八亿斤，1955年又增加到一百八十一亿斤，1956年虽然遭受大旱，也有一百八十亿斤以上，全省每人平均消费粮食仍达到五百六十五斤，比解放前消费量最高的1936年还多出八十九斤。因此，总的来看，粮食情况是好的，农民的粮食消费水平也在逐年提高。但是，由于生产赶不上需要的增长，加上部分群众用粮无计划以及粮食工作上有缺点，某些地方便出现了程度不同的粮食紧张现象。从各地的调查了解，当前普遍而严重的又是部分群众有过急过高地提高用粮水平的思想问题。这部分人在粮食分配上总想多留多销，在粮食使用上总想多吃多用。不少人没有注意节约，还有许多浪费。更多的是用谷来喂猪，因而伤及口粮。这是当前农村粮食工作上一个很大的漏洞。
    中共湖南省委强调指出：各地必须认真组织力量，结合当前生产和预分工作，向农民群众开展一次社会主义的再教育，在粮食问题上展开一次社会主义大辩论。教育农民正确认识国家的粮食工作和农村的粮食问题，说明我们国家的粮食生产情况是好的，但是不很宽裕，只要分配合理，就可够吃够用。如果生产不好，购销不当，用粮有浪费，就会有问题。为了合理分配粮食，搞好今年粮食征购和早中稻预分，省委指示各地今年“三定”仍然不变，个别偏高的定产产量可作适当调整。在社里面，除了继续贯彻按劳取酬、多劳多得的分配原则，今后农村的留粮标准将实行“按户分等，评议定量，由社统一安排”的办法，并按人口大小，分配基本口粮。关于猪饲问题，除了按规定给农民增加自留地外，必须帮助农民订好自留地的全年轮种规划，并利用休闲地和湖塘水面等种植青饲料，加上采摘野生饲料，做到饲料完全自给。
    为了节约用粮，省委要求各地从预分以后即帮助社员订出节约用粮的计划，对于个别浪费严重的户，从粮食分下去以后就可由农业社适当地实行计划管理。
