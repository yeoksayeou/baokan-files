Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Huadong): The fourteen exploration and prospecting teams of the Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Geology, currently active in the northern section of the Kangdian Axis, are constantly reporting good news.

The narrow strip of land north of Dianchi Lake in Yunnan, geologically known as the Kangdian Axis, is the location of China's major copper and iron ore deposits. The northern section of the Kangdian Axis, stretching from the Jinsha River in the south to Danba in the north, encompasses over 30,000 square kilometers of high mountains and deep valleys. It is rich in various ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and non-metallic mineral deposits, making it one of the key areas for geological exploration in the country.

Through diligent work in the first half of this year, the potential reserves of the famous Panzhihua Iron Mine and its surrounding areas have increased by another 150 million tons. The drilling work required for the first phase of the steel base is nearing completion. Currently, the geological personnel of the Panzhihua exploration team are concentrating their efforts on compiling a geological report; it is expected that by the end of this year, they will be able to submit to the state the reserves that have been verified by drilling, sufficient for a steel joint venture producing two million tons of steel per year to mine for fifty years.

The Huatan Iron Mine in Ningnan County, which was confirmed by prospecting last year, has been found to have stable ore layers during this year's drilling process, with total reserves exceeding 100 million tons.

All exploration results prove that the northern section of the Kangdian Axis not only has large iron ore deposits, but also a complete range of iron ore grades, which can meet the needs of establishing huge iron and steel base iron ore resources. In addition, some small and medium-sized copper, nickel and other deposits have been discovered.

Another encouraging piece of news in the exploration of the northern section of the Kangdian Axis in the first half of this year was the discovery of a large pyrite deposit in Tianquan County. This pyrite deposit not only has large reserves, but also high grade, enough to build a large-scale heavy chemical plant to produce sulfur and sulfuric acid, which the country urgently needs, and to meet export needs.

In addition, the Dadu River prospecting team, whose main goal is to provide exploration bases during the Second Five-Year Plan, has also discovered many clues to copper, lead-zinc, iron, manganese, aluminum, and gypsum deposits.

    康滇地轴北段是铜铁之乡
    攀枝花铁矿已探明储量可炼一亿吨钢
    据新华社重庆26日电　新华社记者王华东报道：四川省地质局今年活跃在康滇地轴北段的十四个勘探队和普查队，不断传出捷报。
    地质学上称为康滇地轴的云南滇池以北的狭长地带，是我国大铜矿和大铁矿的所在地。康滇地轴北段南起金沙江、北到丹巴共三万多平方公里的高山深谷中，各种黑色金属、有色金属和非金属的矿藏都很丰富，是全国地质勘探的重点之一。
    经过今年上半年的辛勤劳动，著名的攀枝花铁矿及其外围可能储量，又增加了一亿五千万吨。第一期钢铁基地所需储量的钻探工作已接近完成。目前攀枝花勘探队的地质人员正在集中力量编写地质报告；预计到今年年底可以向国家交出经过钻探证实的储量，足供年产二百万吨钢的钢铁联合企业开采五十年的需要。
    去年经普查证实的宁南县华弹铁矿，在今年钻探过程中发现矿层稳定，总储量可超过一亿吨。
    所有勘探成果证明，康滇地轴北段不仅有很大的铁矿，而且铁矿的品位也很齐备，能满足建立巨大钢铁基地铁矿资源的需要。另外还发现了一些中小型的铜、镍等矿床。
    在康滇地轴北段的勘探中，今年上半年另一个振奋人心的消息，是在天全县发现了很大的黄铁矿。这个黄铁矿不但储量大，品位也高，足够建立一个大型重化工工厂，以生产国家十分需要的硫和硫酸，并且满足出口需要。
    此外，以提供第二个五年计划期间的勘探基地为主要目标的大渡河普查队，也发现了很多铜矿、铅锌矿、铁矿、锰矿、铝矿、石膏矿的线索。
