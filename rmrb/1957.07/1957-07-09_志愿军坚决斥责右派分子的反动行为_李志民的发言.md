    I wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and other national leading comrades.
    When the Chinese People's Volunteers, for seven years as one, persisted in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and vigilantly defended the peace of Korea and the security of the motherland together with the Korean people, when the soldiers guarding the "38th parallel" watched with joy the tremendous achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, suddenly a cloud appeared in the clear sky of the motherland, and the bourgeois rightists, taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement, brazenly launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, attempting to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and lead the motherland to the capitalist road that the people of the whole country despised. The Chinese People's Volunteers express extreme anger at the reactionary behavior of the rightists!
    Our Socialist System is an Important Guarantee of the Victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    The vast majority of the Chinese People's Volunteers are workers and peasants and patriotic intellectuals and students who have been emancipated by following the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. They suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression in the old society. From their own experience, they deeply realized that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and only by following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road can the country be prosperous and strong, and the people free and happy. The Chinese People's Volunteers cherish the great motherland that is advancing along the socialist road like the apple of their eye, and are willing to sacrifice their lives to resolutely defend her. The earth-shaking victories and achievements that the people of the motherland have achieved in the vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction, through letters from the people of the motherland, through the transmission of the motherland people's comfort groups to Korea, and through the newspapers and radio of the motherland, how inspiring it is for the sons and daughters of the motherland who have persisted in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea for a long time abroad! In the days of war, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought heroically and selflessly together with the Korean people, overcoming all kinds of unimaginable difficulties, defeating enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment. Under the fierce bombardment of enemy planes, tanks, and artillery, the soldiers attacked like fierce tigers and defended like Mount Tai. In battle, they often refused to leave the firing line with minor injuries, and even persisted in fighting with serious injuries. In order to defend the motherland and defend peace, thousands upon thousands of comrades of the Volunteer Army contributed their precious lives. After the Korean armistice, the tense and acute struggle between the enemy and us continued. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have been separated from their parents and wives for a long time, and are willing to persist in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea for a long time. They disregarded the wind, snow, and severe cold of winter, and disregarded the sun and rain of summer, vigilantly guarding their positions day and night. At the moment when the relatives of the motherland were sound asleep, the soldiers climbed mountains and ridges, patrolled and stood guard, watching the enemy south of the demarcation line with unblinking eyes. They are willing to use their hard work to protect the happiness of the people of the motherland. They regard protecting the happy life of the people of the motherland as their greatest honor. The high morale and great internationalism and patriotism of the Chinese People's Volunteers are a manifestation of the superiority of our social system. The victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea proves that the socialist system is the source of strength of our people and an important guarantee for the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. For decades, the people of the motherland, in order to achieve this great goal of socialism, have carried out a long-term and arduous struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, and have only achieved today's victory. We must resolutely defend the achievements of the people's revolution and never allow imperialism and its running dogs to infringe upon it! Nor can we allow the rightists to destroy it!
        Without the Leadership of the Communist Party, There Would Be No Victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    The living facts of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight also powerfully prove that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea; without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would not be possible to cope with the possible aggression of imperialism at any time, and the fruits of happiness that the Chinese people have exchanged for long-term hard work, bloodshed, and sacrifice would be deprived, and they would return to the life of cattle and horses. If the conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists to abolish the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party succeeds, it will inevitably bring great disasters to the people.
    Let us look back at the situation when the Korean War broke out. At that time, the People's Republic of China had just been established. After a long period of war, our country was riddled with holes, and production had not yet been restored; while the United States was the most industrially developed country in the world, with steel production exceeding that of our country by more than a hundred times. The warmongers of US imperialism, believing in the "omnipotence" of their modern weapons, attempted to "strangle" the new China in the cradle. When the flames of war in Korea burned beside our motherland, they once declared that the Yalu River was not the border between China and Korea. At this critical moment that determined the fate of the Chinese people, everyone remembers that it was the Communist Party that led the people of the whole country to launch the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to protect the country and defend our homes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely crossed the Yalu River and joined the Korean people to bravely and resolutely meet the army of the world's number one imperialist with inferior equipment. On the question of whether we could defeat US imperialism, didn't some people in the country have doubts at that time? Didn't some people say that "this is asking for trouble"? And historical facts have proved the wisdom of this decision of the Chinese Communist Party! Without this wise decision of the Chinese Communist Party, can we imagine today's peaceful construction?
    The Chinese People's Volunteers are an army led by the Communist Party. It comes from the people and serves the people wholeheartedly. Under the proletarian patriotism and internationalism education, under the guidance of the correct strategic and tactical thinking of the Communist Party, it has carried forward the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Army and become an indestructible and invincible armed force against imperialist aggression. Everyone knows that modern Chinese history is a history of imperialist aggression against the Chinese people, a history of blood and tears of the Chinese people. The Qing Dynasty imperial family commanded the army, the Northern Warlords commanded the army, and Chiang Kai-shek commanded the army. These armies were tools for the rulers to oppress the people and fight for power and profit. They bowed their heads and surrendered to imperialism. At that time, although there were also some national heroes who unyieldingly resisted imperialist aggression, they were often excluded or betrayed by corrupt rulers, and finally suffered setbacks or failures. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army and defeated the most ferocious imperialist aggressor army in the world. Clark, the commander of the US invasion of Korea, also had to say with shame: "I am the first American general to sign an armistice agreement without victory." All this fully shows that without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Who can erase and deny these iron historical facts?
      On the Korean Battlefield, Communists Led the Masses in a Hard and Heroic Battle Against US Imperialism With Their Exemplary Actions
    Throughout the entire War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese Communist Party so bravely led the people of the whole country to shoulder two heavy burdens and move forward steadily. On the other side of the Yalu River was the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea with raging artillery fire, and on the other side of the Yalu River was the vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction, like two battlefields advancing side by side. These two battlefields, under the unified leadership of the Communist Party, played a huge role in promoting each other. The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea gave the people of the whole country a huge ideological impact, raised the ideological awareness of patriotism and internationalism of the people of the whole country, eliminated the pro-American, fear-American, and pro-American sentiments of some people, and became an important driving force for promoting the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland. At the same time, the vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction movement of the people of the motherland gave the Volunteer Army a huge encouragement and became a huge driving force for winning the victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.
    The rightists scolded the Communists for "doing all kinds of evil 90% of the time." Yes, on the Korean battlefield, it was indeed a bad thing for the Communists to "charge ahead and retreat behind" for US imperialism; but for the Chinese people, isn't it a good thing? In the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Communists used their own exemplary role to unite and lead the broad masses in carrying out arduous and heroic battles together. The Communists took the lead, stood at the forefront of the struggle, and shouldered the most dangerous and arduous tasks. They led the masses to charge into battle and led the masses to endure and overcome all kinds of difficulties, becoming a model for the masses. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, among the 526,354 people who were awarded various medals and badges by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for their outstanding contributions or achievements in the war, 258,133 were Communists, accounting for nearly 50% of the total number of medal recipients. Among the 300,272 meritorious personnel who emerged from the entire army, 134,878 were Communists and 92,231 were members of the Communist Youth League. Communists and members of the Communist Youth League accounted for more than 75% of the total number of meritorious personnel. These meritorious personnel were awarded various medals or badges by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Under the influence of the exemplary role of the Communists, some left wills before their sacrifice, requesting the Party to posthumously recognize them as Communists after their sacrifice; some, when they sacrificed heroically, still shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" to express their infinite loyalty to the Party. Aren't these living facts the most powerful refutation of the rightists' slanders and smears?
    The great victory of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea also proves that the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world is an important guarantee for smashing imperialist aggression. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the proletarians and the broad masses of people in all countries of the world directly or indirectly gave us extremely great support and assistance. Without this great internationalist unity, it would be impossible to defeat the enemy. Our enemies have already seen this very clearly. Therefore, the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States and its running dogs are doing their best to provoke and attempt to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the people of all countries in the world. Today, the rightists are also conspiring to undermine our country's unity with socialist brotherly countries, especially with the Soviet Union, which makes us unable to help but be vigilant about their ugly ambitions.
      Historical Experience Educates Us to Resolutely Take the Socialist Road, Safeguard the Leadership of the Party, and Consolidate Unity with Socialist Countries
    Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have been persisting in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea in Korea for nearly seven years, and it has been four years since the armistice. On the "38th parallel," tense, acute, and complex struggles continue. Recently, the US aggressors openly unilaterally abolished Article 13 (D) of the armistice agreement, announced the shipment of new-style weapons into South Korea, and prepared to turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare, seriously undermining the armistice agreement. Encouraged by the US's violation of the armistice agreement, Li Seung-man frantically clamored to "rise up and fight" to solve the so-called "Communist problem." The Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely support the statements of the Chinese and Korean governments protesting the US's violation of the Korean armistice agreement and the shipment of new-style weapons into South Korea. We will never allow US imperialism to wantonly undermine the armistice agreement. We will continue to stand with the Korean people and resolutely safeguard the Korean armistice agreement and fight to smash any conspiracy by US imperialism and the Li Seung-man clique to undermine peace. If the enemy dares to stretch out its claws, it will be resolutely cut off! We know that as long as imperialism exists in the world for one day, the threat of war will exist for one day. Fully preparing to deal with the war that imperialism may launch at any time is a long-term and serious task for the people of our country, and the socialist road, the leadership of the Communist Party, and internationalist unity are the fundamental guarantees for us to smash imperialist wars of aggression and also the historical experience of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. We must resolutely take the socialist road, safeguard the leadership of the Party, and consolidate the great internationalist unity between our country and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The rightists want to undermine it, and we will never allow it!

    志愿军坚决斥责右派分子的反动行为
    李志民的发言
    我衷心地拥护周恩来总理和李先念、薄一波副总理以及其他各位国家领导同志的报告。
    当中国人民志愿军七年如一日地坚持抗美援朝斗争，与朝鲜人民在一起警惕地保卫着朝鲜的和平和祖国的安全的时候，当守卫在“三八线”上的战士们，以欢欣鼓舞的心情注视着祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就的时候，突然看到祖国晴朗的天空出现了一片乌云，资产阶级右派分子利用共产党进行整风的机会，竟无耻地向共产党发动了猖狂的进攻，他们妄图取消共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，把祖国引向全国人民所唾弃的资本主义道路。中国人民志愿军对于右派分子的反动行为表示极为愤怒！
    我国社会主义制度是抗美援朝战争胜利的重要保证
    中国人民志愿军广大成员都是在中国共产党领导下走社会主义道路翻了身的工人和农民以及爱国的知识分子与学生，他们在旧社会里饱受了种种剥削和压迫，他们从自己切身经验深深地体会到没有共产党就没有新中国，只有跟着共产党走社会主义的道路，才能使国家繁荣富强，人民自由幸福。中国人民志愿军像爱护自己的眼睛一样地热爱沿着社会主义道路前进的伟大的祖国，并且不惜牺牲生命来坚决地保卫她。祖国人民在轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，所获得的惊天动地的胜利和成就，通过祖国人民的来信，通过祖国人民赴朝慰问团的传达，通过祖国的报纸和广播，是怎样地鼓舞着在国外长期坚持抗美援朝斗争的祖国儿女呵！在战争的日子里，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民在一起，奋不顾身的英勇战斗，克服了种种难以想像的困难，以劣势装备战胜优势装备的敌人，在敌人飞机、坦克、大炮的猛烈轰击下，战士们攻如猛虎，守若泰山，在战斗中往往轻伤不下火线，甚至重伤仍坚持战斗。为了保卫祖国，保卫和平，志愿军成千上万的同志贡献了自己宝贵的生命。朝鲜停战以后，敌我之间紧张尖锐的斗争仍在继续着。中国人民志愿军的官兵们，长期离别自己的父母妻子，心甘情愿地长期坚持抗美援朝斗争。他们不顾冬季的风雪严寒，不顾夏天的日晒雨淋，日日夜夜地警惕地守卫着阵地。当祖国的亲人们甜蜜入睡的时刻，战士们爬山越岭，巡逻放哨，目不转睛地注视着分界线以南的敌人。他们愿意以自己的辛苦，来保卫祖国人民的幸福。他们把保卫祖国人民的幸福生活看做自己莫大的荣幸。中国人民志愿军高昂的士气和伟大的国际主义与爱国主义精神，是我国社会制度优越性的一种表现。抗美援朝战争的胜利证明：社会主义制度是我国人民力量的泉源，也是抗美援朝战争胜利的重要保证。几十年来，祖国人民为了争取社会主义这一伟大目标的实现，在共产党领导下，进行了长期的艰苦的斗争，方才获得今天的胜利，我们一定要坚决地保卫人民革命的成果，决不允许帝国主义及其走狗侵犯！也不能允许右派分子破坏它！
        没有共产党的领导也就没有抗美援朝战争的胜利
    中国人民志愿军入朝作战的活生生的事实，也有力地证明：没有共产党的领导，就没有抗美援朝战争的胜利；没有共产党的领导，就不能应付帝国主义随时可能的侵略，中国人民长期艰苦奋斗流血牺牲换来的幸福果实，就会被剥夺，而重新过牛马奴隶的生活。如果让资产阶级右派分子取消中国共产党领导的阴谋得逞，就必然会给人民带来天大的灾难。
    让我们回顾一下朝鲜战争爆发时候的形势吧。那时候，中华人民共和国刚刚成立。经过长期战争，我国百孔千疮，生产还没有得到恢复；而美国是世界上工业最发达的国家，当时钢铁产量超过我国一百倍，美帝国主义好战分子，迷信它的现代化武器的“万能作用”，企图把新中国“扼死在摇篮里”，在朝鲜的战火燃烧到我们祖国身旁的时候，他们曾经扬言鸭绿江不是中朝的边界。在这个决定中国人民命运的紧急时刻，大家都记得，是中国共产党领导着全国人民，掀起了伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国运动。中国人民志愿军在共产党的领导下，毅然跨过鸭绿江与朝鲜人民一道，以劣势装备勇敢坚决地去迎击世界上头号帝国主义的军队。对于我们能不能打败美帝国主义这一问题，当时在国内不是有一部分人曾经有过怀疑的吗？有些人不是说过“这是惹火烧身”吗？而历史事实证明了中国共产党这一决策的英明！如果没有中国共产党这一英明的决策，能够设想有今天的和平建设吗？
    中国人民志愿军是共产党领导的军队，它来自人民，又全心全意服务于人民。它在无产阶级爱国主义与国际主义的教养下，在共产党的正确的战略方针和战术思想的指导下，发扬了中国人民军队的优良传统，成为反抗帝国主义侵略的坚无不摧、战无不胜的武装力量。大家知道，中国近代史，是一部帝国主义侵略中国人民的历史，是一部中国人民的血泪史。清朝皇室统率过军队，北洋军阀统率过军队，蒋介石统率过军队，这些军队都是统治者压迫人民争权夺利的工具，他们在帝国主义面前则低头屈膝，望风披靡。当时虽然也有一些民族英雄，不屈不挠地反抗帝国主义的侵略，但是他们往往由于受腐败的统治者排斥或出卖，而终于遭受挫折或失败。中国人民志愿军在共产党领导下，和英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打败了世界上最凶恶的帝国主义侵略军。美国侵朝战争的统帅克拉克也不得不羞惭地说：“我是美国第一个在没有胜利的停战协定上签字的将军”。这一切都充分说明了没有中国共产党的领导，就没有抗美援朝战争的胜利。这些铁的历史事实谁能抹煞和否认呢？
      在朝鲜战场上，共产党员以模范行动来带动群众对美帝国主义进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗
    在整个抗美援朝战争过程中，中国共产党那么勇敢地领导全国人民同时肩挑起两付重担稳步前进，鸭绿江那边是炮火弥天的抗美援朝战争，鸭绿江这边热火朝天地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，好像两支齐头并进的战场一样。这两个战场在共产党的统一领导下，互相起着巨大的推动作用。抗美援朝战争给了全国人民巨大的思想影响，提高了全国人民爱国主义国际主义思想觉悟，扫除了一部分人的崇美、恐美、亲美情绪，成为推动祖国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一个重要动力。同时，祖国人民轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设运动，给了志愿军以巨大鼓舞，成为争取抗美援朝胜利的巨大动力。
    右派分子骂共产党员“百分之九十几无恶不作”。是的，在朝鲜战场上，共产党员“冲锋在前，撤退在后”，对美帝国主义说来，的确是一件坏事；但是，对中国人民说来，难道不是一件好事么？在抗美援朝斗争中，共产党员是以自己的模范作用团结和带领广大群众共同进行艰苦卓绝的战斗。共产党员们以身作则，站在斗争的最前列，担负起最危险最艰苦的任务，他们带领群众冲锋陷阵，带领群众忍受与克服种种困难，成为群众的榜样。在抗美援朝战争中，由于对战争有卓越贡献或显著功绩而荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授予的各种勋章和奖章的五十二万六千三百五十四人，其中，共产党员即有二十五万八千一百三十三人，将近获得勋奖章总人数的百分之五十。全军涌现的三十万零二千七百二十四名立功人员当中，即有十三万四千八百七十八人是共产党员，九万二千二百三十一人是青年团员，共产党员和青年团员占立功人员总数的百分之七十五强。这些立功人员都获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授予的各种勋章或奖章。广大群众在共产党员的模范作用的影响下，有的在牺牲前留下遗书，请求党在他牺牲后追认为共产党员；有的在壮烈牺牲的时候，最后还高呼“共产党万岁！”表示自己对党的无限忠诚。这些活生生的事实，岂不是对右派分子的造谣污蔑最有力的驳斥吗？
    抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，也证明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的团结，是粉碎帝国主义侵略的重要保证。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界各国无产阶级与广大人民直接或间接地给予了我们极其巨大的支援和帮助，如果没有这种伟大的国际主义的团结，要想战胜敌人也是不可能的。这一点，我们的敌人也已经看得很清楚了。因此，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团及其走狗尽其挑拨的能事，妄图破坏社会主义阵营和世界各国人民的团结。今天，右派分子竟也来阴谋破坏我国和社会主义兄弟国家特别是同苏联的团结，这就使我们不能不警惕他们丑恶的野心。
      历史的经验教育我们要坚决走社会主义道路，维护党的领导，巩固同社会主义国家的团结
    现在，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜坚持抗美援朝斗争，已经将近七个年头，就是自从停战到现在也已经有四年了。在“三八线”上，紧张、尖锐、复杂的斗争在继续着。最近，美国侵略者又公然片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，宣布把新式武器运入南朝鲜，准备把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地，严重破坏了停战协定。在美国破坏停战协定行为的鼓舞下，李承晚又疯狂地叫嚣要“奋起作战”来解决所谓“共产党问题”。中国人民志愿军坚决拥护中、朝两国政府抗议美国破坏朝鲜停战协定以新式武器运进南朝鲜的声明，我们决不允许美国帝国主义肆意破坏停战协定，我们将继续和朝鲜人民在一起，坚决维护朝鲜停战协定，为粉碎美帝国主义和李承晚集团任何破坏和平的阴谋而斗争。如果敌人敢于伸进它的魔爪，就坚决斩断它！我们知道，世界上只要一天有帝国主义存在，战争的威胁也就会存在一天，充分准备随时应付帝国主义可能发动的战争，这是我国人民长期的严重任务，而社会主义道路、共产党的领导和国际主义团结，是我们粉碎帝国主义侵略战争的根本保证，也是抗美援朝战争的历史经验。我们要坚决走社会主义道路，维护党的领导，巩固我国与苏联和其它社会主义国家的伟大的国际主义团结，右派分子要破坏它，我们坚决不允许！
