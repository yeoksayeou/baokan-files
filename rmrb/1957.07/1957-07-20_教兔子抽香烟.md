A Snippet:

    Teaching Rabbits to Smoke Cigarettes
    In an American Veterans Administration hospital, forty-four rabbits that can smoke cigarettes are being raised. This hospital began this training work of teaching rabbits to smoke a year ago. Why is this hospital doing this? It turns out that it is to clarify the relationship between "cigarettes and lung cancer" which is currently being hotly debated.
