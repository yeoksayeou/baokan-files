Xinhua News Agency, July 24th—Recently, in many regions across the country, People's Liberation Army units have carried forward the traditional spirit of sharing weal and woe with the people, working together with the people to prevent floods, drain waterlogged areas, rescue materials, and harvest crops, jointly overcoming various difficulties brought about by natural disasters.

During the recent struggle against floods in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, PLA units became a major assault force, appearing in the most arduous and dangerous locations. Troops stationed in the Kaifeng area, in order to help the people in Kaifeng, Lankao, and Yuanyang counties who were flooded, dispatched a large number of strong officers and soldiers, forming four squadrons, and mobilized sixty boats, rushing day and night to the areas most severely affected to rescue people and livestock. In Songwan and two other villages in Yuanyang County, which were surrounded by water, PLA officers and soldiers rescued more than 500 people overnight. Since July 11th, troops stationed in the Shangqiu area have dispatched more than 3,900 personnel, rescuing the elderly, weak, women, and some grain and materials from six villages. They also vacated barracks to provide shelter for nearly 4,000 disaster victims.

Aircraft from a certain PLA Air Force unit have been continuously air-dropping a large number of rubber boats and various flood prevention and rescue equipment over Yuanyang County, Suixian County, and Zhoukou City, where flood prevention is most critical on the Shahe River. Paratrooper soldiers also parachuted into the flooded areas of Yuanyang County to rescue disaster victims.

Currently, officers and soldiers who have initially overcome the floods of the Ru River and Hong River are still guarding the dangerous sections of the river day and night. Kaifeng and other places have formed a mobile flood control force of more than 7,000 people, ready to be投入into the most arduous flood control and disaster relief efforts at any time.

PLA officers and soldiers in the Linyi and Jining areas of Shandong Province, who are rescuing disaster victims and protecting against dangers, are still working day and night. The health departments of various units are also vigorously assisting local medical institutions in treating injured and sick disaster victims.

Upon hearing that some streets in Shanghai were flooded after the rain and some state treasury materials were getting damp, a certain unit of the PLA East Sea Fleet immediately dispatched sixteen heavy trucks to the specialized company's warehouse for rescue. In less than two days, more than 60 tons of damp materials were rescued. Starting from the 20th, the Shanghai Garrison Command dispatched seven to eight hundred officers and soldiers every day to the port to load and unload a large number of materials that were delayed due to the rain. By the 23rd, more than 4,000 tons of grain had been loaded and unloaded.

Before the typhoon hit in mid-month, officers and soldiers of the PLA troops stationed on the Fuzhou front dispatched more than 7,000 personnel to help more than 30 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to harvest early rice. As a result, the crops of these agricultural cooperatives were basically spared from typhoon damage. Many officers and soldiers forgot to eat and sleep in the intense efforts to help the people with the harvest, working from dawn until late at night.

In addition, the PLA naval forces stationed in Tanggu helped salt field workers to harvest a large amount of sea salt before the heavy rain; a certain PLA unit stationed in Guangxi organized manpower to conduct epidemic prevention, treatment, and relief work in rural areas during the season of continuous summer rain; troops in remote areas such as Hotan, Xinjiang, also worked with the local ethnic minorities to carry out flood control and disaster relief work.

    解放军许多部队发扬爱民的光荣传统
    新华社24日讯　最近，全国许多地区的解放军部队，发挥和人民同甘苦共患难的传统精神，同人民一起防汛、排涝、抢救物资、抢收庄稼，共同克服由天灾带来的各种困难。
    在最近山东、河南等省抗御水灾的斗争中，解放军部队成为一支主要的突击力量，出现在任务最艰巨、险要的地方。驻开封地区的部队为了帮助被淹的开封、兰考、?县等地的人民，抽出大批身强力壮的官兵，组成四个中队，并调集了六十只船，星夜赶赴受灾最严重的地区抢救人、畜。在被水包围的?县宋湾等三个村庄，解放军官兵们在一夜之间就抢救出群众五百多人。驻商丘地区的部队自11日以来，已出动三千九百多人次，抢救出六个村庄的老、弱、妇女和一部分粮食物资。他们还腾出营房，使近四千名灾民有了安身之地。
    解放军空军某部的飞机，连日在被水淹的?县、雎县和沙河上防汛最吃紧的周口市等地空投了大批橡皮船和各种防汛抢险器材。伞兵战士并跳伞降落?县水洼地区抢救灾民。
    目前，已初步战胜汝河、洪河洪水的部队官兵，仍在河堤险段日夜防守。开封等各地已组成一支七千多人的防汛机动部队，准备随时投入最艰巨的防汛救灾斗争。
    在山东省临沂、济宁等地区进行抢救灾民和护险工作的解放军官兵，目前仍在夜以继日地坚持工作。各部队卫生部门，也在大力协助地方医务机关医治伤、病灾民。
    解放军东海舰队某部听到上海市部分街道雨后积水，一些国库物资受潮，立即派出重型卡车十六辆，到专卖公司仓库进行抢救。在不到两天时间中，抢救出六十多吨受潮物资。上海警备部队从20日起，每天抽出七、八百名官兵到港口装卸因雨存搁的大批物资。到23日止，已装卸粮食四千多吨。
    驻守福州前线的解放军部队官兵，在本月中旬台风来袭的前夕，出动七千多名官兵，帮助郊区三十多个农业社抢收早稻。使这些农业社的庄稼基本上没有遭到台风灾害。许多官兵在紧张的助民抢收中废寝忘餐，从拂晓直干到深夜。
    此外，驻塘沽海军部队曾在大雨前帮助盐场工人抢收了大批海盐；驻广西解放军某部队，在夏雨连绵的季节组织人力到农村进行防疫、治病和救济工作；远在新疆和阗等地区的部队，也同当地少数民族的人民一起，展开防洪和救灾工作。
