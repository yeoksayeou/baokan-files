Another Spokesperson for Zhang Naiqi
Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles Expose Wang Junliang

    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and members of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) have been holding discussions for days, exposing Wang Junliang, a rightist element in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. Wang Junliang is the Deputy General Manager of the Shenxin Textile Company's General Management Office and the Manager of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Company.

    Wang Junliang believes that the bourgeoisie did not start by exploitation, but by diligence and thrift. After the joint state-private ownership of enterprises, in order to resist the government's work of clearing assets and verifying capital, he put forward a so-called second plan to oppose the plan negotiated by the industry association. After the state representatives went to the factory, he tried to undermine their prestige, repeatedly proclaiming that the joint state-private ownership was not as good as before, and that private enterprises were better than state-owned enterprises. He believed that there was no class relationship after the joint ownership and that capitalists did not need to be reformed. He firmly opposed the establishment of political schools for industrial and commercial circles, opposed industrial and commercial figures participating in the socialist labor competitions within enterprises, and opposed the establishment of an evaluation team in the cotton textile industry.

    In the meetings over the past few days, people have said that Wang Junliang is Zhang Naiqi's spokesperson in Shanghai. This rightist element even defended Zhang Naiqi in action, openly refusing the CDNCA Cotton Textile Industry Company branch to discuss Zhang Naiqi's articles.

    又一个章乃器代言人
    上海工商界揭发汪君良
    本报讯　上海市工商界和民建会员连日举行座谈会，揭发上海工商界右派分子汪君良。汪君良是申新纺织公司总管理处副总经理，上海棉纺工业公司经理。
    汪君良认为资产阶级不是剥削起家，而是勤俭起家的。企业合营后，为了抵抗政府的清产核资工作，他提出了所谓第二方案，和同业公会协商出来的方案相对抗。公方代表下厂后，他又设法打击公方代表的威信，他一再宣扬，企业合营后不如合营前好了，私营企业比国营企业好。他认为企业合营后再没有什么阶级关系，资本家也不须要进行改造，他坚决反对举办工商界政治学校；反对工商界人士参加企业内部的社会主义劳动竞赛，反对棉纺业成立评选工作组。
    在连日的会议上，人们说汪君良是章乃器在上海的代言人，这个右派分子并且在行动上为章乃器辩护，公然拒绝民建棉纺工业公司支部讨论章乃器的文章。
