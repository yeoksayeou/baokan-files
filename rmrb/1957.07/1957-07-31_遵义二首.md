    Zunyi Two Poems
    Fang Ping
    A room upstairs
    With an old clock hanging on the wall,
    It's ticking, ticking,
    In front of the clock is a long table,
    Outside the window stands a tall Chinese parasol tree.
    I quietly climbed to this upstairs room,
    Sacred feelings surged in my heart,
    It reminded me of the days of the Red Army's Long March,
    I understood how Zunyi became a famous city.
    This building stands in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people,
    Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu once lived here;
    This room should be recorded in history forever,
    An important meeting was held here.
    I seem to see the leaders sitting around the table,
    I seem to hear their voices.
    Those powerful hands placed on a map,
    This map attracted the eyes of the whole world.
    The small building accommodated thousands of troops,
    The victorious expedition started from here,
    At this moment, the eastern sun rose,
    At this moment, the brothers saw the brightest red star.
    Clock, you are always moving, moving,
    Are you recording the milestones of the revolution?
    When future generations come to see this room,
    How grateful and praising will they be?!
    Red Flower Ridge
    Thousands of red flags lead the charging队伍,
    Red Flower Ridge became the enemy's grave that year,
    Zunyi City, you cheered, and you shed tears,
    Because the blood of the Red Army was also spilled on the hillside.
    The wild grass on Red Flower Ridge shivers in the wind and rain,
    The Red Army left, the brothers in Zunyi waited,
    Fifteen years were all days of bloodshed,
    The enemy's blade was nicked and sharpened again and again.
    People go to the Red Army graves to burn incense and worship,
    The sound of weeping and grievances rises and falls,
    "Dear ones, your troops are coming soon!
    If our dear ones don't come, how can we live!"
    Dear ones came, and the Qian people [1] had their own motherland,
    Dear ones came, and the Qian people lived a life fit for humans,
    Liberation - what a happy word!
    Who dares to create disasters now that the former butchers are gone!
    Tall eucommia trees have grown around Red Flower Ridge,
    Its orchards are full of bright red apples,
    Zunyi, how young and rich you have become!
    Even the Xiang River [2] water is smiling at you with satisfaction.

    [1] In the past, poor people in Guizhou called themselves "Qian people."
    [2] The Xiang River is a small river that flows through Zunyi City.

放平

    遵义二首
    放平
    一间楼上的房子
    墙上挂着一只古老的时钟，
    它正在滴嗒滴嗒地走动，
    时钟前面有一张长条桌子，
    窗外站着一棵高大的梧桐。
    我放轻脚步来到这座楼上，
    神圣的感情激荡我的心胸，
    它使我想起红军长征的日子，
    我理解遵义怎样变成了名城。
    这座楼矗立在亿万人的心里，
    它曾住过毛主席和朱总司令；
    这间房间应该永远载入史册，
    一次重要会议曾在这里举行。
    我仿佛看见领袖们围桌而坐，
    我仿佛听见他们说话的声音。
    那双有力的手放在一张图上，
    这张图吸引住全世界的眼睛。
    小小的楼上容下了千军万马，
    胜利的出征就从这里面起程，
    这时天空升起了东方的太阳，
    这时弟兄见到了最亮的红星。
    时钟呵，你永远走动，走动，
    是不是在记录着革命的里程？
    当子孙们也来看看这间房子，
    他们将会怎样的感激和歌颂！？
    红花岗
    千杆红旗引领冲锋的队伍，
    红花岗当年变成了敌人的坟墓，
    遵义城呵，你欢呼，你又落泪，
    因为红军的血也洒上了山坡。
    红花岗的野草在风雨中抖索，
    红军走了，遵义的兄弟们等着，
    十五年过的全是淌血的日子，
    敌人的刀口缺了又霍霍地再磨。
    人们到红军坟上去焚香礼拜，
    哭诉冤屈的声音时起时落，
    “亲人呵，你们的队伍快来哟！
    亲人要不来，我们怎么能活！”
    亲人来了，乾人〔一〕才有自己的祖国，
    亲人来了，乾人才过人过的生活，
    解放——这是个多么幸福的字眼！
    从前的屠夫谁还敢来制造灾祸！
    红花岗的周围长起了高大的杜仲，
    它的果园里结满了红艳艳的苹果，
    遵义呵，你变得多么年青和富庶！
    连湘江〔二〕河水也在对你满意地笑着。
    〔一〕贵州过去穷人自称为“乾人”。
    〔二〕湘江是流过遵义城的小河。
