　　Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, an Egyptian military spokesperson said on the 17th that Egypt has protested to the United Nations Mixed Armistice Commission regarding Israel's violations of Egypt's border and airspace.

　　The spokesperson listed Israel's acts of aggression: On July 10th, seven armed Israeli soldiers in a jeep crossed the demarcation line north of Gaza and penetrated 200 meters into the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops only retreated after the United Nations Emergency Force intervened; on July 11th, a jeep carrying seven Israeli soldiers crossed the demarcation line east of Gaza and penetrated into the Gaza Strip.

　　The spokesperson said that the Egyptian side has requested an investigation into these two incidents.

　　The joint headquarters of the Syrian and Egyptian armies held a meeting in Damascus on the 16th to discuss the situation on the Syrian border. The Syrian headquarters maintains constant contact with the Cairo headquarters.

　　According to a report in the "Al-Balad" newspaper on the 17th, Syrian Minister of State for Information and Propaganda, Akil, said, "We know for certain that France, together with Israel, has amassed troops on the armistice line near our border. If they are not hoping to wage a strong war of nerves (which we are used to and not worried about), they will attack the armistice line, at which time they will find us waiting in full battle array. If Israel and imperialism do not receive a sufficient blow, they will receive an even more severe blow."

　　Syrian Prime Minister Asali said on the 17th that Syria welcomes any Arab aid that helps Syria "resist further Israeli threats of aggression." He told reporters that in the event of "any Israeli aggression against Syria or any other Arab country," the other Arab countries would never stand idly by.

　　Syrian Information Minister Saleh Akil also welcomed Moscow Radio's commentary on the 17th regarding the tense situation on the Syrian-Israeli border. He said: "I think this warning [from Moscow Radio] is enough to make the aggressors think twice before taking any further aggressive action in Syria."

　　According to United Nations news: United Nations officials said on the 17th that the United Nations has, at Israel's request, established four or five observation posts inside Israel on the Israeli-Syrian border to prevent border conflict incidents.

　　Syria's representative to the United Nations, Rafik Asha, told the United Nations that Syria believes that Israel should be responsible for any incidents arising from the threats made by Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion.

　　Ben-Gurion recently issued a so-called warning to Syria, saying that Israel was prepared to respond "forcefully" to "any provocations" from Syria.

　　Asha said: "We believe that border incidents are always provoked by Israel."

　　News from Jerusalem said that the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in the Israeli-Syrian border area has received reinforcements and is conducting surveillance 24 hours a day.

    埃及抗议以色列侵犯边境和领空  叙利亚再警告法以两国不要玩火
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：埃及军方发言人17日说，埃及已经就以色列侵犯埃及的边境和领空问题向联合国混合停战委员会提出抗议。
    发言人列举了以色列的侵犯行动：7月10日，七名以色列武装士兵乘坐一辆吉普车在加沙以北越过了分界线，并且侵入加沙地带有二百公尺之远。在联合国紧急部队进行干涉以后，以色列军队才撤退；7月11日载有7名以色列士兵的一辆吉普车在加沙以东越过了分界线侵入加沙地带。
    发言人说，埃及方面已经要求对这两次事件进行调查。
    叙利亚和埃及军队联合总部16日在大马士革举行会议，讨论了叙利亚边境的局势。叙利亚总部同开罗总部不断保持联系。
    据“巴拉达报”17日报道，负责宣传和情报的叙利亚国务部长阿基勒说，“我们确知，法国同以色列一起在我国边境附近的停战线上集结了军队。他们若不是希望进行强烈的神经战，（对于这一套我们已经司空见惯，并不担心）就是要进攻停战线，那时他们将发现我们正在严阵以待。如果以色列和帝国主义受到的打击不够的话，他们将得到更加严重的打击。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利17日说，叙利亚欢迎帮助叙利亚“抵抗以色列进一步的侵略威胁”的任何阿拉伯援助。他对新闻记者说，万一“以色列对叙利亚或任何其他阿拉伯国家发动任何侵略”时，其余的阿拉伯国家是决不会袖手旁观的。
    叙利亚情报部长萨勒·阿基勒在同一天表示欢迎莫斯科电台17日关于叙利亚—以色列边境紧张形势的评论。他说：“我想，（莫斯科电台的）这个警告足以使侵略者在叙利亚采取任何进一步的侵略行动以前好好地想一想。”
    另据联合国消息：联合国官员17日说，联合国已经应以色列之请，在以色列和叙利亚边境的以色列境内设立了四、五个观察站，以防止边境冲突事件。
    叙利亚驻联合国的代表拉菲克·亚沙对联合国说，叙利亚认为，以色列应对由于以色列总理本—古里安的威胁而产生的任何事件负责。
    本—古里安最近曾经向叙利亚发出所谓警告说，以色列准备“强有力的”回击来自叙利亚的“任何挑衅”。
    亚沙说：“我们认为，边境事件总是以色列挑起的。”
    来自耶路撒冷的消息说，联合国停战监督组织在以叙边境地区已经得到援军，并且一天二十四小时都在进行监视。
