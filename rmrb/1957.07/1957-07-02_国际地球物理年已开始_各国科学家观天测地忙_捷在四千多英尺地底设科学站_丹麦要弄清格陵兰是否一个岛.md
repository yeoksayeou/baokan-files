Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: Greenwich Mean Time, July 1st, marked the official start of the International Geophysical Year. From now on, nearly ten thousand scientists from over sixty countries around the world will collaborate closely for a year and a half to further unlock the secrets of the Earth, the Sun, and the universe.

In the Soviet Union, more than five hundred scientific stations and observatories began work on the tasks outlined in the International Geophysical Year program on this day. After five years of careful preparation, during the Geophysical Year, the work of Soviet scientists will expand from the Soviet Union to Antarctica, the Arctic, and the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. On June 30th, Leningrad received telegrams from scientists on Dickson Island and the "North Pole 7" ice floe scientific station, stating "all preparations are complete." During the Geophysical Year, they will release fifteen thousand radiosondes into the air up to tens of kilometers above the Arctic region, automatically reporting wind direction, wind speed, and temperature.

According to recent news, in addition to launching large artificial satellites during the Geophysical Year, the Soviet Union also plans to launch one hundred and twenty-five rockets from Franz Josef Land in the Arctic region, mid-latitudes of the European part of the Soviet Union, and the "Peace Village" in Antarctica, to an altitude of two hundred kilometers to explore the upper atmosphere.

The United States also has more than five hundred scientific stations engaged in observation and research. As everyone knows, American scientists have already launched large-scale work in Antarctica. Recently, the United States also established an ice floe drifting station in the Arctic, composed of thirty-four scientists. This is the second time the United States has established an ice floe scientific station in the Arctic (the first time was in 1951).

Throughout the International Geophysical Year, the United States plans to launch a total of six hundred high-altitude rockets. Before launching six artificial satellites, the United States will launch seven experimental multi-stage rockets. According to American scientists, the first American artificial satellite will be launched from Cape Canaveral on the east coast of Florida in January next year. If this artificial satellite is launched successfully, it will be observable in the region from 35 degrees north latitude to 35 degrees south latitude.

Approximately one hundred observatories in Czechoslovakia received instructions to begin observations on July 1st. One of these observatories is located on Mount Lomnický štít, which is over eight thousand six hundred feet high; another observatory is located in an abandoned mine in Bohemia, which is over four thousand seven hundred feet deep, making it the deepest scientific station in the world.

During the International Geophysical Year, Polish scientists will not only strengthen observations and research throughout the country, but also send an expedition to the vicinity of Spitsbergen in the Arctic to conduct observations and research on projects such as aurora and magnetism. In addition, an expedition will be sent to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to establish scientific stations to observe and study earthquakes, climate and other conditions.

The one hundred and ninety scientific stations in the United Kingdom were all ready on the eve of the International Geophysical Year and have now begun observation and research. The British Antarctic expedition led by Fuchs is also actively preparing to set off in November this year to complete the feat of crossing the Antarctic continent.

In Italy, on the first day of the International Geophysical Year, an oceanographic research vessel left the Naples pier in a simple ceremony. The other four research vessels will also set off one after another to conduct observation and research work.

During the International Geophysical Year, Danish scientists will concentrate on studying the conditions in Greenland, first of all to clarify whether Greenland is a single island or many small islands connected by ice.

During the International Geophysical Year, scientific institutions in various countries will not only cooperate closely through telecommunications, but also exchange scientists. According to scientists, the total cost of this International Geophysical Year will reach 500 million US dollars, most of which will be borne by the Soviet Union and the United States.

    国际地球物理年已开始
    各国科学家观天测地忙
    捷在四千多英尺地底设科学站
    丹麦要弄清格陵兰是否一个岛
    新华社1日讯　7月1日格林威治时间零时，国际地球物理年正式开始了。从此，全世界六十多个国家将近一万个科学工作者，将在一年半的时间中紧密合作，进一步揭开地球、太阳和宇宙的秘密。
    苏联境内五百多个科学站和观测所在这一天开始了地球物理年计划规定的工作。经过为时五年的周密准备，在地球物理年期间，苏联科学家的工作将从苏联一直扩大到南极、北极和太平洋、大西洋和印度洋。6月30日，列宁格勒收到了迪克逊岛、
  “北极七号”浮冰科学站等地科学家的“一切都已准备完毕”的电报。在地球物理年期间，他们将在北极地区放出一万五千个无线电探空仪进入几十公里的空中，自动地把风向、风速和气温报告出来。
    据最近消息，在地球物理年中，苏联除了要放射大型的人造卫星外，还要在北极地区的佛兰兹约瑟夫地、苏联欧洲部分的中纬度地区和南极“和平村”放射一百二十五个火箭，到二百公里的高空去探测大气上层的情况。
    美国也有五百多个科学站投入了观测研究工作。大家知道，美国科学家已经在南极展开了规模巨大的工作。最近，美国还在北极建立了一个由三十四个科学工作者组成的浮冰漂流站，这是美国第二次（第一次在1951年）在北极建立浮冰科学站。
    在整个地球物理年期间，美国共要放射六百个高空火箭。在放射六个人造卫星以前，美国将放射七个试验性的多段火箭。据美国科学家估计，明年1月，美国第一个人造卫星将在佛罗里达东部沿海的卡纳维拉尔角放射。如果这个人造卫星放射成功，那末，在从北纬三十五度到南纬三十五度地区内都能观察得到。
    捷克斯洛伐克约一百个观测站在7月1日收到了开始观测的指示。其中有一个观测站建立在八千六百多英尺高的隆尼策峰上；另一个观测站却建立在波希米亚一个深达四千七百多英尺的废弃的矿井里，它是目前世界上最深的科学站。
    波兰科学家在地球物理年期间，除了在国内各地加强观测和研究外，还派一个考察队到北极斯迈次卑尔根群岛附近去从事极光、磁力等项目的观测研究工作。另外还派了一个考察队到越南民主共和国去建立科学站，观测研究有关地震、气候等情况。
    英国一百九十个科学站在地球物理年前夕，全部准备就绪，目前也已经开始观测研究工作。英国福克斯率领的南极考察队也在积极准备今年11月出发完成横越南极大陆的壮举。
    在意大利，地球物理年开始的第一天，一艘海洋考察船在简单的仪式中离开了那不勒斯码头。其他四艘考察船也即将陆续出发作观测研究工作。
    丹麦科学家在地球物理年期间，将集中力量考察研究格陵兰的情况，首先是弄清楚格陵兰是一个岛呢，还是被冰块联结在一起的许多小岛。
    在地球物理年期间，各国科学机构不仅要通过电讯联络紧密合作；而且还要互相交换科学家。据科学家估计，这次国际地球物理年的全部费用将达五亿美元，其中大部分将由苏联和美国负担。
