Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese government today officially decided and announced that it would relax the "embargo" restrictions on China to the level applied to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries.

The Japanese government's decision was announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi after a cabinet meeting this afternoon. Aiichi's communique stated that the Japanese government formally made this decision in consideration of the progress made by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) in May in discussing the relaxation of the "embargo" on China, and in consideration of the importance of trade with China to the Japanese economy.

The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry then announced, after the cabinet meeting, a list of 270 items that were removed from the "embargo" and could be exported to China. The goods removed from the embargo include machine tools, trains, communications equipment, steel products, chemicals, and rubber products.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today on the Japanese government's formal announcement of the relaxation of the "embargo" on China, saying that the issue of Japan's trade with China can no longer be resolved simply by removing the "embargo" on some commodities. Instead, all outstanding issues in developing Japan-China trade should be resolved quickly.

The statement reiterated the demand that the Japanese government resolve issues such as the mutual establishment of trade representative offices, the signing of payment agreements and the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, and the fingerprinting of personnel from Chinese commodity exhibition delegations entering Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese business circles are generally disappointed with the Japanese government's decision announced today to relax the "embargo" restrictions on China. They hope for a wider relaxation, especially the relaxation of restrictions on the export of ships and heavy machinery.

    日本放宽对华“禁运”
    社会党要求采取进一步措施
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本政府今天正式决定并且宣布把对中国的“禁运”限制放宽到对苏联和东欧社会主义国家所实行的水平。
    日本政府的这项决定是在今天下午举行的内阁会议结束后由内阁官房长官爱知揆一宣布的。爱知宣布的公报说，日本政府正式作出这个决定，是由于考虑到巴黎统筹委员会在5月间讨论放宽对中国“禁运”问题上所取得的进展，并且考虑到同中国贸易对日本经济的重要性。
    日本通商产业省在内阁会议后接着宣布了被解除“禁运”而可以向中国出口的二百七十项货物名单。被解除禁运的货物中包括工作母机、火车、通讯设备、钢铁制品、化学品和橡胶制品等。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天就日本政府正式宣布放宽对中国的“禁运”发表声明说，日本同中国进行贸易的问题已经不能仅仅靠采取解除一些商品的“禁运”的办法来解决，而应该迅速地解决发展日中贸易方面的各项悬而未决的问题。
    声明再次要求日本政府解决互设贸易代表团、签订支付协定和第四次日中贸易协定以及中国商品展览会代表团人员进入日本时按指纹等问题。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本贸易界对日本政府今天宣布的放宽对中国的“禁运”限制的决定普遍感到失望，他们希望能放得更宽些，特别是希望放宽对船舶和重型机器出口的限制。
