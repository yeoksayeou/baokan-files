Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: Chairman Ho Chi Minh received a warm welcome from the long-expectant citizens of Warsaw when he arrived in Warsaw at noon on the 21st. The welcoming crowds lined the streets from the airport, along the route taken by the distinguished guest, all the way to the city center.

    The airport was decorated like a festival. After Ho Chi Minh disembarked, he shook hands and embraced Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz. About half of today's welcomers were children, who stood at the very front. Because Chairman Ho is known in Poland for his love of children. Almost every child held high the flags of both Vietnam and Poland, welcoming the distinguished guest.

    Zawadzki said in his welcoming speech at the airport that the name of Chairman Ho Chi Minh is dear to every Pole. The Polish people closely follow the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom and independence. We fully sympathize with you and support your efforts for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam based on democratic principles.

    Zawadzki said that an unbreakable and consolidated friendship, based on a common ideology and common efforts, links the people of our two countries. We are convinced that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's friendly visit to Poland, like the Polish government delegation's visit to Vietnam earlier this year, will be another step forward on the right path of our common progress.

    In his reply, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the common goal of building socialism and safeguarding world peace unites us. Our fraternal unity is growing and strengthening day by day.

    Ho Chi Minh said that during the years of the liberation war, the Vietnamese people often received the support of the Polish people. After peace was achieved, they received friendly assistance from the Polish people in their country's economic construction and cultural development. As a member of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission, Poland has made a positive contribution to the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to the cause of maintaining peace in Vietnam, Indochina, and Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese people deeply thank the Polish people, the Polish United Workers' Party, and the Polish government for their generous assistance.

    On the afternoon of the 21st, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the leaders of the Polish state and the Polish United Workers' Party.

    Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, Gomulka, and other members of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party received Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

    Subsequently, Chairman Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, paid a return visit to Ho Chi Minh's residence.

    The Polish newspapers of the day published pictures of Chairman Ho Chi Minh on the front page and published editorials for his visit to Poland.

    共同的目标加强了兄弟般的友谊
    华沙市民热情欢迎胡志明主席
    据新华社华沙22日电　胡志明主席在21日中午到达华沙的时候，受到了盼望已久的华沙市民的热情欢迎。欢迎的队伍从机场排起，沿着贵宾驱车走过的道路一直排到市中心。
    飞机场上像节日一样打扮起来。胡志明下飞机后，同哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹紧紧握手拥抱。在今天的欢迎者当中，约有半数是儿童，他们都站在最前列。因为胡主席在波兰是以喜爱孩子著称的。几乎每个孩子都双手高举波越国旗，欢迎贵宾。
    萨瓦茨基在机场上致欢迎词说，胡志明主席的名字是每个波兰人都感到亲切的。波兰人民密切地注意越南人民争取自由和独立的斗争。我们完全同情你们，并且支持你们为根据民主原则和平统一越南所作的努力。
    萨瓦茨基说，以共同的意识形态和共同的努力为基础的牢不可破和巩固的友谊，把我们两国人民连结起来。我们深信胡志明主席对波兰的友好访问，正像波兰政府代表团今年年初对越南的访问一样，将是在我们共同前进的正确道路上向前迈进的又一步。
    胡志明主席致答词说，建设社会主义和维护世界和平的共同目标使我们团结起来。我们兄弟般的团结正在日益发展和加强。
    胡志明说，在解放战争的年代，越南人民经常得到波兰人民的支持。在实现了和平以后，他们在祖国的经济建设和文化发展上得到波兰人民的友好援助。作为越南国际监督和监察委员会的一员，波兰对执行日内瓦协议的事业，对维护越南、印度支那和东南亚的和平的事业，作出了积极的贡献。越南人民深深感谢波兰人民、波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的慷慨援助。
    胡志明主席21日下午拜会了波兰国家和波兰统一工人党的领导人。
    萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、哥穆尔卡和波兰统一工人党政治局的其他一些委员接待了胡志明主席。
    随后，波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基到胡志明的寓所作了回拜。
    这天的波兰各报在第一版刊载了胡志明主席的像片，并且为他的访问波兰发表了社论。
