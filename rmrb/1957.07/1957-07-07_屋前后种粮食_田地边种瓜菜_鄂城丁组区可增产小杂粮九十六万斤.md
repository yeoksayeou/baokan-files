Planting Grain in Front of and Behind Houses; Growing Melons and Vegetables Along Field Edges
Echeng Dingzu District Can Increase Production of Small Grains by 960,000 Jin

　　(Our Newspaper News) All sixty-one agricultural production cooperatives in the Dingzu District of Echeng County, Hubei Province, under the call of "Every Inch of Land Must Be Contested" by the Dingzu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have planted all field ridges, edges, and spaces in front of and behind houses with small grains and melons and vegetables (excluding cotton field edges). In 1956, more than 400 large and small villages and more than 58,600 field ridges and edges throughout the district yielded a total of more than 220,000 jin of soybeans, cowpeas, and mung beans, and more than 267,000 jin of corn and sorghum. The two items totaled more than 587,000 jin, accounting for 1.8% of the district's total annual grain output. In addition, more than 500,000 jin of various melons and vegetables were harvested. This year, the utilization of field ridges and edges has increased, and it is estimated that 960,000 jin of small grains can be harvested.
    The planting and distribution methods for these small grains are as follows: field ridges and edges are planted by the cooperative or production team, and the harvest is distributed uniformly to the members and is not counted as part of the "three fix" quota. The spaces in front of and behind houses are planted and harvested by the members themselves and are also not counted as part of the "three fix" quota. Last year, the increase in income from this portion of small grains played a significant role in ensuring the grain needs of the members and completing the state procurement tasks. After retaining sufficient "three fix" rations, the members of the district overfulfilled the public grain surplus grain tasks, and the grain supply was greatly reduced. Last spring, the state supplied 700,000 jin of grain to this district, but this spring it was reduced to 315,000 jin. Many members have not yet finished eating the small grains they planted themselves last year.

### 屋前后种粮食　田地边种瓜菜  鄂城丁组区可增产小杂粮九十六万斤

    屋前后种粮食　田地边种瓜菜
    鄂城丁组区可增产小杂粮九十六万斤
　　本报讯　湖北省鄂城县丁组区全区六十一个农业生产合作社，在中共丁组区委“寸土必争”的号召下，把所有的田塍地边屋前屋后都种上了小杂粮和瓜菜（不包括棉花地边）。1956年全区四百多个大小村庄五万八千六百多条田塍地边，收入黄豆、元豆、绿豆等共二十二万多斤，玉米、高粱共二十六万七千斤，两项共计五十八万七千多斤，占全区全年粮食总产量的1.8％。此外，还收入各种瓜菜五十多万斤。今年田塍地边的利用有了增加，预计可收小杂粮九十六万斤。
    这些小杂粮的种植和分配方法是：田塍地边归社或生产队种植，收获物统一分给社员，不算三定留量。屋前屋后由社员自种自收，同样不算三定留量。去年由于增加了这部分小杂粮的收入，对保证社员用粮需要和完成国家征购任务起了很大作用。全区社员在留足三定口粮的情况下，超额完成了公粮余粮任务，而且粮食供应量大大缩小了。去年春季国家供应这个区七十万斤粮食，今年春减缩到三十一万五千斤。很多社员自己种的小杂粮到现在还没有吃完。
