    Review Plans, Revise Drawings, Reduce Costs, Save Land:
    Sichuan Province Practices Economy in Capital Construction

    (Our Newspaper News) Sichuan Province's relevant departments are implementing the principle of "building the country through diligence and frugality" and practicing economy and opposing waste in all aspects of capital construction (from planning and design to construction).

    After Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo delivered a report to cadres inside and outside the Party in Sichuan Province and Chengdu in May on "How to Conduct Rectification in Capital Construction Work," the Sichuan Provincial Planning Commission and the relevant leading departments of key industrial construction zones such as Leshan and Yibin began to re-examine the capital construction plans. They cut some non-essential, non-productive buildings and lowered the standards of some buildings. Chengdu City reduced more than 1.7 million yuan from the original urban construction investment plan. With the help of the work group of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, the state-owned Chengdu Thermal Power Plant revised the design drawings, saving approximately 2 million yuan in investment. By the end of June, more than 80 units in Chongqing City had reduced capital construction projects and lowered the cost of civil buildings, saving the state a total of 4.01 million yuan in investment.

    The leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Urban Construction Design Institute, based on more than 80 rationalization proposals made by employees, comprehensively proposed 19 design improvement plans. The six methods that are now being promoted in the design, such as reinforced concrete floor slabs, reduced floor heights, and casement-free doors and windows, can reduce the cost of civil buildings by nearly 40% compared with last year, and the average cost of buildings can be reduced to about 35 yuan per square meter. The design institute also revised the designs of eleven construction projects that had already started based on these plans, saving 150,000 yuan in funds.

    In terms of land use, both Chongqing and Chengdu have conducted special inspections. In Chongqing alone, 50 construction units returned more than 2,200 mu of land for agricultural cooperatives to use.

    审查计划　修改图纸　降低造价　节约用地
    四川省在基本建设中厉行节约
    本报讯　四川省各个有关部门正根据“勤俭建国”的方针，在基本建设的各个环节（从计划、设计直到施工）中厉行节约，反对浪费。
    国务院副总理薄一波5月间向四川省和成都市党内外干部作了“在基本建设工作中如何进行整风”的报告以后，四川省计划委员会和乐山、宜宾等工业建设重点专区的有关领导部门，都着手重新审查基本建设计划。他们削掉了一些不是必需的非生产性建筑，降低了一些建筑的标准。成都市从原来安排的城市建设投资中削减了一百七十多万元。国营成都热电厂在电力工业部工作组帮助下，把设计图纸作了修改，节约投资约二百万元。重庆市到6月底止，有八十多个单位削减了基本建设项目，降低了民用建筑造价，共为国家节约投资四百零一万元。
    四川省城市建筑设计院领导方面根据职工提的八十多条合理化建议，综合提出了十九个改进设计的方案。现在开始在设计中推行的钢筋砖?形楼板、降低层高、无盒门窗等六个办法，就可使民用建筑的造价比去年降低将近40％，楼房平均造价可降低到每平方公尺三十五元左右。这个设计院还根据这些方案修改了十一个开始施工的工程设计，节约了十五万元的资金。
    在土地使用方面，重庆、成都两市都进行过专门检查。仅重庆市就有五十个建设单位退出二千二百多亩土地，交给农业社使用。
