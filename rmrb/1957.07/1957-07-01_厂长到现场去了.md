Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th -- "As soon as the factory director arrives, he goes to the site." Anyone coming from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Ansteel Company, or other units looking for the factory director would receive such an answer from the secretaries.

People would often find the factory director by the side of the fighting steel furnace, where he was working with the workers to solve some difficult problems in steelmaking production, or researching new steel grades' smelting methods and improving operating techniques.

This factory director is Zeng Yangqing, the factory director of Ansteel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant. In the three and a half years since he came to this factory, he has spent most of his time with the workers by the steelmaking furnace.

An official from Ansteel's planning department in charge of steelmaking production told reporters: Factory Director Zeng's spirit of hard work and dedication is truly inspiring. Through several years of training, Factory Director Zeng has become known as an all-round factory director in terms of organizing and managing production and mastering steelmaking technology. Generally speaking, the steelmaking production tasks are always completed relatively well.

Factory Director Zeng not only understands production management but has also made many contributions in steelmaking technology. Like a steelmaking foreman, he personally smelted dozens of different types of high-quality steel. He led the workers in successfully smelting silicon steel for generators and transformers in a large open-hearth furnace for the first time. Last year, based on his long-term practical experience, he summarized a new steelmaking method – slagging during the initial melting, which, after three months of experimentation, proved to shorten the time for each furnace of steel by more than a quarter of an hour. It is now universally mastered by steelmakers throughout the steelmaking plant.

Zeng Yangqing is a Communist Party member who was originally an intellectual. During the Anti-Japanese War, he studied and worked at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts in Yan'an. During the Liberation War, he served as a district head and engaged in land reform. He has only been studying and practically engaging in steelmaking production for six or seven years.

### “厂长到现场去了”

    “厂长到现场去了”
    新华社鞍山30日电  “厂长一来就到现场去了”。不论是从冶金工业部、鞍钢公司或其他单位有事来找厂长的人，都会得到秘书们这样的回答。
    人们找到厂长的时候，常常是在战斗的炼钢炉旁，厂长正和工人们在一起解决炼钢生产中的一些困难问题，或者研究新的钢种的冶炼方法，改进操作技术。
    这位厂长就是鞍钢第一炼钢厂厂长曾扬清。自从他来到这个厂的三年半的时间里，他的大部分时间都是和工人们一起在炼钢炉旁度过去的。
    鞍钢计划处一位专管炼钢生产的工作人员告诉记者：曾厂长艰苦钻研的工作精神真使人感动。经过几年来的锻炼，曾厂长不论是组织、管理生产和掌握炼钢技术方面，已经被人们称为全能厂长了。一般说，炼钢的生产任务总是完成得比较好的。
    曾厂长不仅懂得管理生产，而且在炼钢技术方面也有过不少贡献。他像炼钢工长一样，亲自冶炼过几十种不同性质的优质的钢，第一次在大型平炉中冶炼制造发电机和变压器用的矽钢，是他带领工人们一起炼成的。去年，他根据长期实际操作经验总结出来的一种新炼钢法——熔化初札就造渣，经过三个月的实验证明，每炼一炉钢确实能缩短一刻钟以上的时间，现在已为全炼钢厂的炼钢工所普遍掌握了。
    曾扬清是一个共产党员，原来是个文化人，抗战时期在延安鲁迅艺术学院学习和工作，解放战争期间做过区长，搞过土地改革。学习和实际搞炼钢生产工作只不过六七年的时间。
