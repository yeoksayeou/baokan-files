    Beware of Insect Pests
    Hebei Autumn Locusts Emerge
    (Reported by our newspaper) Around July 10th, in Weixian, Pingxiang, and Guangzong counties of the Xingtai Special District in Hebei, autumn locusts were found emerging from the soil in more than 8,000 mu of land. In Weixian County's Gu Xian, Sangyuan, Lao Sha, and Chengguan, a total of four patches of autumn locust nymphs were found, covering approximately 1,800 mu. Generally, there were 20-30 locusts per square foot, and in some areas as many as 70-80. Currently, the counties have transported large quantities of pesticides and equipment to the locust-affected areas to carry out eradication measures, aiming to eliminate the autumn locusts in their hatching stage.
    Gansu Experiences Armyworm Infestation
    (Reported by our newspaper) Recently, the number of armyworms in Gansu Province has increased sharply. Larvae have already hatched in the Wudu area, and armyworms have emerged in Linxia, Lanzhou, Wuzhong, Pingliang, Jingyuan and other places. According to predictions, this year's armyworm infestation is characterized by early occurrence, a large number of female moths, and high egg production. It is expected that large numbers of larvae will appear in various places soon.
    The armyworm is a devastating pest that, when severe, swarms in large numbers, covering the ground. It damages crops such as millet, wheat, barley, rice, sorghum, broomcorn millet, corn, cotton, and hemp. Last year, the armyworm prevention and control work in Gansu Province was not comprehensive enough, which created conditions for a possible large-scale outbreak in some areas this year. At the same time, the recent climate has been conducive to the occurrence of armyworms. Therefore, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry notified all localities in early July to seize the opportunity and rapidly carry out prevention and control measures.

    河北秋蝗出土
    本报讯  河北邢台专区威县、平乡、广宗三县，7月10日左右在八千多亩地里发现秋蝗出土。威县的固献、桑园、老沙、城关共发生四片秋蝗幼蝻，约一千八百多亩，一般每方尺二、三十头，多的七、八十头。现在各县已将大批农药械运至蝗区，进行除治，以便把秋蝗消灭在孵化出土阶段。
    甘肃发生粘虫
    本报讯  最近甘肃省粘虫发生数量急增。武都地区幼虫已经孵化，临夏、兰州、吴忠、平凉、靖远等地粘虫已经发生。据预测，今年粘虫的特点是发生早，雌蛾多，产卵多。预计各地不久即有大量幼虫出现。
    粘虫是一种毁灭性的害虫，严重的时候，成群结队，遍地皆是。它为害谷子、小麦、大麦、稻子、高粱、糜子、包谷、棉花、大麻等作物。去年，甘肃省粘虫防治工作开展不够全面，这就造成今年一些地方可能大量发生的条件；同时，近来气候又适宜于粘虫的发生。因此，省农林厅于7月初通知各地，抓紧时机，迅速防治。
