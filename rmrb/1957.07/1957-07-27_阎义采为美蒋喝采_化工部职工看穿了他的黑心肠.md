Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Staff members of the Ministry of Chemical Industry have held multiple symposiums since July 9th to expose and refute the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of rightist Yan Yicai within the Party.

	Yan Yicai was originally a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party, working in the security section of the Ministry of Chemical Industry's Exploration Company. Before the "May Day" holiday, his probationary period expired. The branch believed that his level of awareness was not high enough and did not approve his conversion to a full member, which made him extremely dissatisfied. Later, when rightists in society were frantically attacking the Party, he took the opportunity to cause a disturbance in the Exploration Company's manager's office, shouting "Down with the Communist Party!" and violently assaulting people four times in a row, hitting fourteen people including company employees, the deputy manager, police officers, and the head of the residents' group. In early July, he wrote two extremely reactionary articles, "A Two-Party System is Suitable for China's National Conditions" and "The Communist Party's Regime is Unstable; Our People Will Stand Up and You Will See," echoing the rightists in society.

	In his articles, Yan Yicai reversed black and white and maliciously slandered the Party's policies. He described the agricultural collectivization policy and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing as the Party's "strategic offensive against the peasants," "robbing peasants of land, grain, and livestock." He depicted the countryside as a scene of misery. He remained silent about the great achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, and the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, but "sought justice" for counter-revolutionaries, saying that they were "wrongfully struggled against, imprisoned, and innocently suffered disgrace and family separation." At the same time, he believed that American imperialism and "President Chiang" were of great benefit to the Chinese people, comparable to the Communist Party, and called on people to visit Taiwan.

	In his articles, Yan Yicai used all sorts of vicious words and metaphors to insult high-ranking Party cadres, activists, and all those who support the Party and the People's Government, while praising a small number of self-seeking bourgeois rightists as "wise and courageous." He also stirred up relations between the Party and workers, peasants, and intellectuals, saying that the working class was still "in a state of starvation and slavery," that "the Communist Party says the working class is the leading class, this is feeding rice soup to the working class, it is one of Mao Zedong's tricks," and that "the Communist Party has adopted the 'kill the donkey after it has finished grinding' policy towards the peasants." He also said that the intellectuals' situation was extremely pitiful, "any negligence at work will be labeled as 'using technology to create destructive accidents'." He also ridiculed those engineering and technical personnel who did not attack the Party, saying that they were "cowardly and afraid of trouble."

	Yan Yicai made extremely absurd estimations of the broad masses of people who firmly follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He believed that "the number of people in the countryside who oppose the Communist Party is increasing day by day," "the world is falling apart, heroes are rising everywhere, and the Communist Party's regime is unstable and has insurmountable contradictions." Therefore, he put forward a series of political propositions, preparing to make a big splash. He claimed that his purpose in supporting Zhang Bojun was to abolish the Party's leadership and take the capitalist road of the "two-party system," saying that "only in this way can we truly realize 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend'." He then called on all those who oppose the Party and the government to unite and "organize a new united front" to "overthrow the Communist Party." He also demanded that those who share the same "ideals" as him propagate their reactionary views to the masses and carry out a "long and arduous struggle." As for exactly who shared the same "ideals" as him, he did not honestly confess, but fabricated a list of counter-revolutionary groups to frame good people. Currently, those who have been slandered by him have filed charges.

	When Yan Yicai's articles were published on big-character posters, they aroused great indignation among the staff of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. The Ministry of Chemical Industry's Exploration Company, based on the demands of the masses, held a forum to debate some of his views. However, in the first meeting, he only stammered and prevaricated. When he was invited to attend the meeting again for the second time, he refused to attend. Currently, more than one hundred big-character posters have been published by the Ministry of Chemical Industry and its affiliated units to refute his reactionary words and deeds. Staff members of various departments, design institutes, research institutes, and other twenty-eight units have held symposiums to refute him. In the future, the Ministry of Chemical Industry will continue to deeply criticize his reactionary words and deeds.

### 阎义采为美蒋喝采  化工部职工看穿了他的黑心肠

    阎义采为美蒋喝采
    化工部职工看穿了他的黑心肠
    据新华社26日讯　化学工业部的工作人员自7月9日起举行了多次座谈会，揭露与驳斥党内右派分子阎义采反党反社会主义的言论。
    阎义采原来是中共预备党员，在化工部勘察公司保卫科工作。“五一”节前，他的预备期满，支部认为他的觉悟水平不够，没有通过他转为正式党员，他极为不满。后来，正当社会上的右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，他又借故大闹勘察公司经理室，高呼“打倒共产党”，并且连续四次逞凶打人，先后打了公司职工、副经理、民警、居民组长等十四人。7月上旬，他写了“两党制适合中国国情”、“共产党的政权是不巩固的，我们的人站出来你们看”两篇反动透顶的文章，与社会上的右派分子互相呼应。
    阎义采在文章中，颠倒黑白，向党的政策肆意污蔑。把农业合作化政策、统购统销政策说成是党“向农民的战略进攻”，“向农民抢劫土地、粮食、牲畜”。他把农村描绘成一片惨凄景象。他对镇反、三反、肃反运动所取得的伟大成绩闭口不谈，而为反革命分子“伸张正义”，说他们是“含冤被斗、被关，无辜的遭到身败名裂、妻离子散”。同时，他认为美帝国主义、“蒋总统”对中国人民有莫大好处，堪与共产党相比较，还说蒋介石也在进行经济建设，号召人到台湾去参观。
    阎义采在他的文章中用尽一切恶毒的字眼和比喻，来辱骂党的高级干部、积极分子和一切拥护党和人民政府的人，而把一小撮利欲熏心的资产阶级右派分子誉为“大智大勇”。他还挑拨党同工人、农民、知识分子的关系。说工人阶级还是“处在饥寒交迫的奴隶地位”，“共产党说工人阶级是领导阶级，这是向工人阶级灌米汤，是毛泽东的一套手段”，说“共产党对农民采取了‘拉完了磨杀驴子’的政策”。还说知识分子的遭遇也极为可怜，“凡是工作上的疏忽都会被扣上‘利用技术制造破坏事故’的帽子”。他还讥笑那些没有向党攻击的工程技术人员，说他们是“胆小怕事”。
    阎义采对在中国共产党领导下坚决走社会主义道路的广大人民，作了极端荒谬的估计。他以为“在农村中反对共产党的人日益增加”，“天下分崩，英雄四起，共产党的政权是不巩固的，有不可克服的矛盾”。因此，他提出一系列政治主张，准备大干一场。他声称拥护章伯钧的目的在于取消党的领导、走资本主义道路的“两党制”，说“只有这样才能真正实现‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’”。他接着号召一切反对党和政府的人联合起来，“组织新的统一战线”，“打倒共产党”。他还要求和他具有同一“理想”的人向群众宣传他们的反动观点，进行“长期的艰苦的奋斗”。至于究竟什么人和他具有同一“理想”，他并没有老老实实交代，反而捏造了一个反革命集团的名单，陷害好人。目前这些被他污蔑的人已经提出控告。
    当阎义采的文章在大字报上公布以后，激起化工部工作人员的极大义愤。化工部勘察公司曾根据群众的要求，召开座谈会，准备就他的一些观点进行辩论。但是他在第一次会上只是支吾其辞，搪塞了事。第二次再请他参加会议时，他又拒不参加。目前化工部和所属单位已经出了一百多张大字报驳斥他的反动言行。各司局、设计院、研究院等二十八个单位的工作人员都举行座谈会进行驳斥。今后对他的反动言行，化工部还将继续深入批判。
