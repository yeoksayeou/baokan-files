    Resolutely Smash the Right-Wingers' Frenzied Attack!
    Cheng Qian's Speech
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the other important reports submitted to this congress. Premier Zhou's report comprehensively summarized the great achievements of our government work, truthfully pointed out the shortcomings and errors in our work, and at the same time, forcefully countered the various fallacies of the bourgeois right-wingers. Now, I would like to express some thoughts on the political topic of opposing the bourgeois right-wing's attack.
    Countering the Right, Inspiring Heroism
    This spring and summer has been an extraordinary season. During this season, workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all patriots, while actively helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style, also launched a magnificent, righteous, and stern counterattack against the bourgeois right-wing's frenzied anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist attacks, knocking down the once arrogant arrogance of the bourgeois right-wing and creating favorable conditions for the Communist Party's rectification campaign and the democratic parties' rectification campaigns. Looking at it now, the results are great and glorious, but the battle is still fiercely underway, and the struggle is still developing deeply. People must be soberly aware that the class struggle broadly unfolding on the political and ideological fronts between two roads—the socialist road and the capitalist road—is a very tortuous and complex struggle, a struggle that will last for a considerable period of time, and also a struggle that will be quite sharp and intense at certain times. Who triumphs over whom depends on the balance of power, that is, it depends on whether the broad masses can arm themselves with more powerful ideological weapons to fully, thoroughly, criticize, expose, and isolate the right-wingers.
    The bourgeois right-wing's attack on the Party, the people, and socialism is not accidental; it is an inevitable law of the development of our social and political situation. The people of the whole country love and support the Communist Party, and the people of the whole country want to take the socialist road, but a handful of bourgeois right-wing elements vainly attempt to weaken, get rid of, and abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, dreaming of the restoration of the capitalist system in China. Water and fire are incompatible, so of course there will be struggle; the outbreak of close combat only depends on time and conditions.
    The Chinese Communist Party has made the greatest determination to eradicate the "three evils," actively carry out a rectification movement within the Party, and sincerely and humbly ask non-Party members to offer opinions to help overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes, so as to better lead the people of the whole country in socialist construction. This was originally a great thing, and all those who love the Party and love the cause of socialism wholeheartedly supported this wise move of the Communist Party. They affirmed the great achievements in their work with a realistic attitude, and at the same time, in a responsible and serious spirit, they put forward some constructive opinions to the Party and exposed the problems existing in their work. This further strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses of the people and greatly promoted our socialist cause. However, at this very moment, the bourgeois right-wing, which had been watching the situation for a long time and was always ready to throw cold arrows, took advantage of the name of helping the Party to rectify its work style and the pretext of "great blooming and great contending," and madly issued vicious remarks to discredit the Communist Party, overthrow the Communist Party, slander socialism, and overthrow socialism, and supplemented them with sinful, organized, and ghostly actions. This could not but arouse the righteous indignation of the people of the whole country, and a magnificent, overwhelming counterattack was launched against the bourgeois right-wing's shameful and wanton attack.
    Reactionaries, how foolish!
    What does this battle show? I think:
    First, it shows the reactionary and foolish nature of the bourgeois standpoint. After more than a month of great exposure and great revelation, we can now roughly review the basic ranks of the bourgeois right-wing. This team includes: stubborn bourgeois elements who are not reconciled to the socialist transformation and their spokespersons, such as Zhang Naiqi; political careerists who turn their hands into clouds and their hands into rain, such as Zhang Bojun; shameless minority of senior intellectuals, such as Luo Longji; and the evil offspring who have differentiated from the feudal landlords and warlord bureaucratic camps, such as Long Yun and Huang Shaohong. According to the materials that have been revealed, the Zhang-Luo alliance is obviously a reactionary group with organization, plan, program and line. This mainly refers to the commanders. Naturally, there are also a group of staff officers and strategists, and cheerleaders and soldiers. These people are anti-communist, anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-people's democratic dictatorship. These people are greedy for money and blinded by greed. They are some people who never forget to compete for fame and gain, always want to reach out and grab something, and have no principles or right and wrong. In the people's country under the leadership of the Communist Party, they always feel "wronged and unable to stretch themselves"; last year's great socialist change, digging up their "ancestral graves" from the economic foundation, has aroused their class instinctive hatred even more. They always think that one day, when the time is right, they can break through the "gap" and hit back. Their minds are full of evil thoughts, their souls are restless, and they turn their eyes to the outside world all day long, occasionally seeing a dark cloud floating in the blue sky, and they think that "the mountain rain is about to come" and there is something to be gained. They see the Communist Party's rectification and think that the Communist Party's Jiangshan is unstable and the situation is not good, so they offer the black evil wind of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism, fueling the flames and setting fires everywhere, as if they will become a climate and establish a great cause in the blink of an eye. They never dreamed that in less than thirty days, the poisonous weeds and gases they released would encounter the embarrassing situation of "rats crossing the street, everyone shouting and beating," and their wishful thinking was greatly frustrated! Usually, they claim to be "political realists" and "good men" who are "carefully calculating." In my opinion, especially based on their tragic lessons this time, they are just daydreamers who are confused, and they are just big fools who have not even learned the four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As the "People's Daily" said, "Bourgeois right-wing gentlemen, you regard the Chinese people's decades of revolutionary history as a child's play, the Chinese people's eight years of construction history as a child's play, the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people and the Party's high prestige among the people as a child's play, and when estimating the balance of power, you can't even figure out which side has more people and more power, the one percent of the population or the ninety-nine percent of the population. How can you not make mistakes like this?" People who hold the bourgeois standpoint think they have some dark intelligence, but in fact they are extremely foolish. Reactionaries are foolish. Isn't it clear enough through this contest of strength?
    It is said that the bourgeois right-wing has another unspeakable estimation. They secretly assume: Isn't your Communist Party saying that you want to peacefully transform private industrial and commercial enterprises? Won't your severe criticism of me, Zhang Naiqi, have a bad impact internationally? Isn't your Communist Party saying that you want to peacefully liberate Taiwan? Won't your severe refutation and exposure of me, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Long Yun, and Huang Shaohong, cause more concerns among the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan? According to this foolish logic, the bourgeois right-wing is convinced that the Communist Party and the people of the whole country can do nothing to them, and they have to remain silent about their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds and let them flood. This estimate of the bourgeois right-wing is also greatly wrong. Because the Communist Party and the people of the whole country understand: According to Zhang Naiqi's method, it is not a peaceful socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, but a restoration of the capitalist exploitation system; according to Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Long Yun, and Huang Shaohong's method, it is not a peaceful liberation of Taiwan, but Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction "returning to the court" and restoring its fascist criminal rule. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country understand: The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce adopts the policy of redemption and peaceful methods, and the ultimate goal is to change the private ownership of capitalist means of production into socialist public ownership, and to transform capitalists and exploiters into self-reliant laborers. Only by achieving victories in both enterprise transformation and human transformation can we be regarded as using the brilliant revolutionary practice to demonstrate the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and enrich the arsenal of Marxism-Leninism, and this will have a far-reaching and positive impact internationally. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country understand: Only by resolutely repelling the attack of the right-wing elements and resolutely defeating their attack can the Communist Party carry out the rectification movement well, the political awareness of the people of the whole country be further improved, the steps be more consistent, the unity be more consolidated, the socialist construction cause be developed more rapidly, and our national strength be stronger, and this will be most conducive to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. For the members of the KMT Revolutionary Committee, drawing a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois right-wing can stimulate true socialist patriotism, influence the military and political personnel in Taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland, take the socialist road, and participate in the construction of the motherland. It is completely wrong to fear that the development of the anti-rightist struggle will affect the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country understand these truths, and will never relax the anti-rightist struggle. The bourgeois right-wing's desire to "avoid hitting the rat for fear of breaking the porcelain" is just a waste of effort!
    Democratic parties must eliminate corruption and promote new things through the anti-rightist struggle and establish a direction of serving socialism.
    Second, it shows the direction of the democratic parties. China's democratic parties have developed and grown up under the leadership and help of the Chinese Communist Party. If China's democratic parties have made some contributions and done some good things for the people in the two historical stages of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, it is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, to say that this party "started by opposing the Communist Party" or that that party "became rich by relying on the middle line" is a distortion of history and a false statement against one's will. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the democratic parties participated in the government, successively raised their hands to pass the Common Program and the Constitution, recognized the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and confirmed the political line of serving socialism, thus gaining the trust and goodwill of the people and obtaining the political status of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the Chinese Communist Party. Now, some members of certain democratic parties, especially some people who have usurped important positions and show up in public, have torn off their masks, are ungrateful, and refuse to recognize history; they are faithless and openly violate their promises. They want to overthrow the Communist Party and want to replace it; they want to induce the socialist train to derail and want to lead the train to the graveyard of capitalism. This is not only challenging their own political morality, but also cannot but make people wonder: Is it still necessary for such a democratic party to exist? I firmly believe that all patriots in the democratic parties who are for the country and the people cannot remain silent at such a critical moment. They must stand up and speak out, and not allow a few scoundrels and a few bourgeois right-wingers to tarnish the democratic parties. Through the rectification movement centered on the anti-rightist struggle, the democratic parties will surely eliminate corruption and promote new things, gain strong vitality, and do more useful things for the socialist cause together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The right-wing elements of the KMT Revolutionary Committee, in addition to Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, Tan Tiwu and others of the KMT Revolutionary Committee's central authorities who have been exposed, more than 30 people have been exposed in various places. The main characteristics of the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements of the KMT Revolutionary Committee are: on the issue of developing the organization, they advocate that all former Kuomintang members return to the team, establish organizations universally in counties and cities, recruit troops and buy horses everywhere, and do not ask about the political history and political outlook of the development objects; on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they obliterate achievements, exaggerate shortcomings, and repeatedly emphasize "mistakes must be corrected," "calling for injustice" for counter-revolutionary elements, and under the false name of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, they are actually opposing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; in terms of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, they are not sincere, but want to share the court and divide the autumn colors, one-sidedly emphasizing supervision, but are unwilling to accept the supervision of the Communist Party; in implementing the policy of "unity, education, and transformation," they only talk about unity, not transformation, only emphasize arrangements, not education, and do not regard the bureaucratic warlord status of the old society as shameful, but are complacent and use it as a condition for fighting for arrangements; under the false banner of "caring" about the lives of peasants, they shout for landlords and rich peasants; covered in the "patriot" green gauze, they make anti-Soviet absurdities. The above-mentioned performances, in essence, are reflections of feudal landlord class ideology and capitalist ideology within the KMT Revolutionary Committee. Now, a realistic assessment should be made of the ideological changes of the members of the KMT Revolutionary Committee and the general old military and political personnel. In the eight years since liberation, the ideological level of these comrades has been improved to some extent. A small part has improved faster, most have improved to some extent, and another small part, that is, the right-wing elements, has improved very little, and some individuals are almost "standing still," still the same. Since these people maintain the original set of positions, viewpoints, and methods, they are easily infected by external forces, and it is completely understandable that they are triggered at the touch of a button. The reactionary thoughts, words and actions of such a group of right-wing elements of the KMT Revolutionary Committee have not been criticized and exposed fiercely enough so far. Some comrades are still living peacefully with the right-wing elements and cannot draw a clear line; some comrades take a protective attitude towards the right-wing elements; some comrades are silent, passive, and resistant; that is to say, the right-wing elements within the KMT Revolutionary Committee have not been subjected to the criticism they deserve. I think that, like the democratic parties, the task before the KMT Revolutionary Committee is to deeply carry out the rectification movement of the anti-rightist struggle. This is the correct direction for the KMT Revolutionary Committee as a political party serving socialism.
    Do everything possible to resolutely strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Third, it shows that the leadership of the Communist Party must be strengthened with all efforts. The Chinese Communist Party is the concentrated expression of the wisdom and conscience of the Chinese people, and the embodiment of the Chinese people's good ideals. The Chinese Communist Party leads the Chinese people in building socialism, which embodies the highest interests of the Chinese people. Shaking the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party shakes the cornerstone of socialism, and also shakes the foundation of our country. The Chinese Communist Party's leadership over national affairs is not shouted out by the Communists, but is a conclusion made by history, and is the demand and aspiration of the Chinese people. Historical facts show that when the Chinese Communist Party had not yet appeared on the political historical stage, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising movement and the Xinhai Revolution movement that burned all over the north and south of the Yangtze River were ultimately inevitably defeated; when the Chinese Communist Party was still in its infancy and its political struggle experience was not yet very rich, the vigorous First Revolutionary Civil War also suffered defeat; and when the Chinese Communist Party was once tempered in the fire of struggle to become mature and formed a leadership core headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolutionary movement immediately changed its appearance, and in a short period of twenty years, it successively achieved the victory of the Anti-Japanese National Liberation War, the complete victory of the democratic revolution, and the basic victory of the socialist revolution. A heroic history of the Communist Party's victory in struggle is a history written with the blood of the martyrs. The Chinese people's demand for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is based on history. People come from history, and ordinary workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all patriots understand this most basic truth. When the bourgeois right-wingers clamor and take practical actions to weaken, get rid of, and abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, we should answer loudly: We must strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party, and we must take practical actions, from all aspects, and do everything possible to resolutely strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party. If we don't do this, according to the bourgeois right-wing elements, the country will be destroyed, and the people will fall into the dark abyss of doom.
     If you must go to the right, you will become political garbage.
    I would like to say a few words to the bourgeois right-wing elements here. Some of you, in the past, especially during the democratic revolution, did some good things for the people to varying degrees. If you did good things for the people, the people will of course not forget, and the opportunity you have today to work for the people is the most fair reward given by the people. However, good things must be continued to be done, and must be done to the end. If you don't do them to the end, give up halfway, or even go the other way, dig the foundation of the Communist Party, dig the foundation of socialism, it will arouse the opposition of the people and be spurned by the people. If you did good things yesterday and did big bastard things today, the people cannot agree. The history of China in the past 100 years is the best textbook for the people of the whole country and for all political activists. After each great change, great shock, and great movement, in addition to the vast majority of fellow travelers moving forward with history, there are always some who abandon their armor and run away in panic, and eventually become waste materials that cry secretly in the gutter. This is an iron law, and no one can escape the test of this ruthless objective law. Who is the real revolutionary and who is the two-faced opportunist will make a factual and historical conclusion in the face of this law. Now it is approaching such a sharp moment again, and everyone must answer this question without ambiguity: Go to the right, or go to the left? Take the capitalist road, or take the socialist road? Stand firmly on the capitalist position, or stand firmly on the socialist position? The former is a dead end, this road is not passable, if you must go, you will become political garbage. The latter is the bright road chosen by 600 million people. Following the people on this road, you can overcome obstacles and enter a better state. I advise the right-wing elements who are taking the former road: It is impossible for people not to make mistakes, "it is great to know mistakes and be able to correct them." The door to socialist transformation is always open to you. As long as you are enlightened and change your course, honestly put your anti-communist, anti-socialist filthy thoughts, ugly "private words," and unspeakable secret plots and plans, originally, clearly, cleanly, and thoroughly explain to the people, explain to the society, and also use practical actions to expose other right-wing elements, this shows that you are determined to turn from right to left, from reactionary to revolutionary. If you did bad things yesterday and change to do good things today, the people can forgive you. If you insist on your own way, adhere to the reactionary position, use your evil words and deeds to undermine the socialist cause, violate the criminal law, it shows that you are alienating yourself from the people, isolating yourself from the people, and transforming from the people's side to the people's enemy side. The people will not agree to this kind of person's behavior, and they will be punished.
    In the sharp struggle against the right-wingers, at such an extraordinary moment, I am willing to be an ordinary soldier. I am just an old recruit, but I resolutely draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, work for the socialist cause, and closely follow the progress of history!

    坚决打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻！
    程潜的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和向这次大会提出来的其他各项重要报告。周总理的报告概括地总结了我们政府工作的伟大成绩，实事求是地指出了工作中的缺点和错误，同时对资产阶级右派的形形色色的谬论进行了有力的回击。现在，我想就反对资产阶级右派的进攻这个政治题目发表一点感想。
    回击右派，气壮山河
    今年的春夏，是一个不平常的季节。在这个季节里，工人、农民、革命的知识分子和一切爱国人士，在帮助共产党积极整风的同时，又向资产阶级右派反共、反人民、反社会主义的猖狂进攻展开了气壮山河、义正词严的回击，把一度飞扬跋扈的资产阶级右派的嚣张气焰打落了下去，为共产党整风和各民主党派整风创造了顺利的条件。现在来看，战果是伟大辉煌的，但是，战斗仍在激烈进行，斗争还在深刻发展。人们必须清醒地认识到，在政治战线上和思想战线上所广泛展开的两条道路——社会主义道路和资本主义道路——的阶级斗争，是一场十分曲折复杂的斗争，是一场相当长时期的斗争，也是一场在某一个时期内表现得相当尖锐激烈的斗争。谁战胜谁，决定于力量的对比，也就是说决定于：广大群众能以更强有力的思想武器武装起来，充分地、彻底地批判、揭露和孤立右派。
    资产阶级右派向党、向人民、向社会主义发动进攻不是偶然的，这是我们的社会政治形势发展的必然规律。全国人民热爱和拥护共产党，全国人民要走社会主义道路，但一小撮资产阶级右派分子妄图削弱、摆脱和取消共产党的领导，梦想资本主义制度在中国复辟。水火不相容，当然就会有斗争；短兵相接的战斗的爆发，只是决定于时间和条件而已。
    中国共产党下最大决心涤荡“三害”，在党内积极开展整风运动，诚恳地、虚心地请党外人士提意见，帮助克服缺点和纠正错误，以便更好地领导全国人民从事社会主义建设事业。这本来是一件天大的好事，一切热爱党、热爱社会主义事业的人们，都竭诚拥护共产党这个英明举措，他们以实事求是的态度，肯定了工作中的巨大成绩，同时本着负责严肃的精神，向党提出了一些建设性的意见，揭露了工作中存在的问题。这就进一步密切了党和人民群众的联系，大大地推进了我们的社会主义事业。可是，正在这个时刻，久久窥伺方向、时时准备投出冷箭的资产阶级右派，却假借帮助党整风的名义，利用“大放大鸣”的由头，疯狂地发出了搞臭共产党，搞垮共产党，诬蔑社会主义，搞垮社会主义的恶毒的言论，并且辅之以罪恶的有组织的鬼蜮行动。这就不能不激起全国人民的义愤，向资产阶级右派的可耻的肆意进攻展开大气磅礴，排山倒海的反攻。
    反动者，愚蠢也！
    这场战斗究竟说明了什么问题呢？我认为：
    第一、说明了资产阶级立场的反动和愚蠢。经过一个多月的大暴露和大揭露，现在大体上可以检阅一下资产阶级右派的基本队伍了。这个队伍包括：对社会主义改造死不甘心的顽固的资产阶级分子和他们的代言人，如章乃器之流；翻手为云、复手为雨的政治野心家，如章伯钧之流；恬不知耻的少数高级知识分子，如罗隆基之流；从封建地主和军阀官僚营垒里边分化出来的孽障，如龙云、黄绍竑之流。就现在揭发出来的材料来看，章罗联盟显然是一个有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线的反动集团。这主要是指挂帅的。自然，也还有一批参谋擘划的文臣武将，摇旗呐喊的喽啰兵卒。这些人是反共的，反人民的，反社会主义的，反人民民主专政的。这些人利欲熏心，利令智昏，是一些念念不忘争名夺利的、时时想伸手捞一把的、毫无原则的、毫无是非的人们。在共产党领导下的人民国家里，他们总觉得“受了委屈，难能伸展”；去年社会主义大变革，从经济基础上挖了他们的“祖坟”，这就更引起了他们发自阶级本能的刻骨的仇恨。他们总想，有朝一日，因缘时会，冲开“缺口”，倒打一耙。他们满脑邪思，魂不守舍，成天翻起阳白眼，瞟着窗外云天，偶尔望见万里碧空上浮动一块乌云，就以为“山雨欲来”，大有可图。他们看见共产党整风，就以为共产党江山不稳，局面不妙，于是祭起反共、反人民、反社会主义的黑煞风，推波助澜，到处点火，似乎他们成气候，立大业，就在转眼之间。他们做梦也没有想到，不出三十天的功夫，他们放出来的毒草和毒气，就遭遇到了“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的狼狈尴尬局面，他们一相情愿的如意算盘大大地落了空！平常，他们自诩为“政治上的现实主义者”，是“精打细算”的“好汉”。依我看，特别是根据这次他们悲惨的教训来看，他们只不过是一些发昏十三章的狂想主义者，只不过是一些连加减乘除四则也没有学好的大笨蛋。“人民日报”说得好，“资产阶级右派先生们，你们把中国人民几十年的革命史看作儿戏，把中国人民八年的建设史看作儿戏，把党和人民群众的血肉联系和党在人民群众中的高度威信看作儿戏，而且在估计力量对比的时候，连人口中占百分之一的人和占百分之九十九的人究竟哪一边人多力量大，都算不清。你们这样怎么能不犯错误呢？”持资产阶级立场的人们自以为有一些阴暗的聪明，实际上是天大的愚蠢。反动者，愚蠢也。通过这次实力的较量，难道还看得不够明显吗？
    据说资产阶级右派还有一个不可告人的估计，他们暗自设想：你们共产党不是说和平改造私营工商业吗？你们对我章乃器这样严厉地口诛笔伐，这不会在国际上产生不好的影响吗？你们共产党不是说要和平解放台湾吗？你们对我章伯钧、罗隆基、龙云、黄绍竑这样严厉地驳斥揭露，这不会在台湾的国民党军政人员中间产生更多的顾虑吗？根据这个愚蠢的逻辑，资产阶级右派满以为共产党和全国人民对他们无可奈何，对他们的反共、反人民、反社会主义的言行只好默不作声，让其泛滥。资产阶级右派这个估计又大大错误了。因为，共产党和全国人民懂得：依了章乃器的办法，就不是什么对资本主义工商业进行和平的社会主义改造，而是资本主义剥削制度的复辟；依了章伯钧、罗隆基、龙云、黄绍竑的办法，就不是什么和平解放台湾，而是蒋介石反动派“班师回朝”，恢复其法西斯的罪恶统治。共产党和全国人民懂得：对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造采取赎买政策和和平办法，最终目的还是将资本主义生产资料的私有制改变为社会主义的公有制，将资本家剥削者改造为自食其力的劳动者，只有取得企业改造和人的改造的两方面的胜利，我们才算是以革命的光辉实践论证了马列主义的普遍真理，丰富了马列主义的武库，在国际上才能产生深远良好的影响。共产党和全国人民懂得：只有坚决回击右派分子的进攻，坚决打垮他们的进攻，共产党才能很好地开展整风运动，全国人民的政治觉悟才能更加提高，步调才能更加一致，团结才能更加巩固，社会主义建设事业才能更加迅速发展，我们的国力才能更加强大，而这样也才最有利于台湾的和平解放。对民革的成员来说，和资产阶级右派划清界线，才能激发真正的社会主义的爱国心，影响台湾的军政人员回到祖国怀抱，走社会主义道路，参加祖国建设。害怕反右派斗争的开展会影响台湾的和平解放，是完全错误的。共产党和全国人民懂得这些道理，就绝不会放松反右派的斗争，资产阶级右派想望“投鼠忌器”，徒然煞费心机而已！
    民主党派要通过反右派斗争，去腐催新，确立为社会主义服务的方向
    第二、说明了民主党派的去向。中国的各民主党派是在中国共产党领导、帮助下发展成长起来的。如果说，中国的各民主党派在民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个历史阶段，对人民有些贡献，作了一些好事，那是和中国共产党的领导密不可分的。因此，说这个党是“靠反共起家”，说那个党是“靠中间路线发迹”，这是歪曲历史的违心之论，是睁开眼睛说瞎话，是别有用心。在人民共和国成立以后，各民主党派参加了政权，先后举手通过了共同纲领和宪法，承认了中国共产党的领导，确认了为社会主义服务的政治路线，这样就取得了人民的信任和好感，获得了和中国共产党“长期共存、互相监督”的政治地位。现在，某些民主党派的某些成员，特别是某些窃据要津、抛头露面的人物，撕下了假面具，忘恩负义，翻脸不承认历史；背信弃义，悍然违背自己的诺言。他们要搞垮共产党，想取而代之；他们要诱使社会主义的列车脱轨，想将列车引向资本主义的坟墓。这不仅仅是向自己的政治道德挑战，同时也不能不使人们怀疑：这样的民主党派还有没有存在的必要？我坚决认为，所有民主党派中的为国为民的仁人志士，在这样一个节骨眼上，都不能够保持缄默，都要站出来说话，不许少数败类，少数资产阶级右派沾污了各民主党派。通过以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动，各民主党派必将去腐催新，获得健壮的生命力，在中国共产党领导下，和全国人民一道，为社会主义事业做更多有益的事情。
    民革的右派分子，除了已经揭露的民革中央的龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾等人之外，各地已经揭露者有三十余人。民革右派分子的反动言行的主要特征是：在发展组织问题上主张旧国民党员通通归队，县、市普遍建立组织，到处招兵买马，不问发展对象的政治历史和政治面貌；在肃反问题上，抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，口口声声强调“有错必纠”，为反革命分子“呼冤叫屈”，假和平解放台湾之名，行反对肃反之实；在接受共产党的领导方面，不是诚心实意，而是想分庭抗礼，秋色共沾，片面强调监督，却又不愿意接受共产党的监督；在贯彻“团结、教育、改造”的方针上，只讲团结，不讲改造，只强调安排，不谈教育，不以旧社会的官僚军阀地位为可耻，反而沾沾自喜，以此作为争取安排的条件；在“关心”农民生活的假幌子下，为地主、富农叫喊；蒙着“爱国者”的青纱，大弹反苏滥调。上面种种表现，就它的实质来讲，都是封建地主阶级思想和资本主义思想在民革内部的反映。现在，应当对民革成员和一般的旧军政人员的思想变化作一些实事求是的估计。解放八年来，这些同志的思想水平是有所提高的。一小部分提高得较快，大部分有所提高，另外一小部分，也就是说右派分子，则很少提高，个别人几乎是“原地踏步”，依然故我。这些人既然保持原来一套的立场、观点、方法，外力感染，一触即发，这是完全可以理解的。对于这样一批民革右派分子的反动思想、言论和行动，到目前为止，还批判揭露得不够猛烈有力。有些同志现在仍然和右派分子和平共居，不能划清界限；有些同志采取袒护右派分子的态度；有些同志沉默、消极、抵触；也就是说，民革内部的右派分子还未受到应有的抨击。我认为，和各民主党派一样，摆在民革面前的任务是，深入地开展反右派斗争的整风运动。这就是民革作为一个为社会主义服务的政党的正确去向。
    想尽一切办法坚决加强共产党的领导
    第三、说明了必须倾全力地加强共产党的领导。中国共产党是中国人民的智慧和良心的集中表现，是中国人民的善良理想的化身。中国共产党领导中国人民建设社会主义，体现了中国人民的最高利益。动摇了中国共产党的领导，就动摇了社会主义的基石，也就动摇了我国的国本。中国共产党对国家事务的领导权，不是共产党人空口叫嚷出来的，是历史作出来的结论，是中国人民的要求和愿望。历史事实表明：当中国共产党还没有出现在政治历史舞台上的时候，燃遍大江南北的太平天国农民起义运动和辛亥革命运动，最终都不免于失败；当中国共产党还处于幼年阶段、政治斗争经验还不十分丰富的时候，轰轰烈烈的第一次国内革命战争也遭受了失败；而当中国共产党一经在斗争的烈火中锻炼成熟、并且形成了以毛泽东主席为首的领导核心的时候，中国的革命运动就立刻改观，在短短二十年期间内，连续取得抗日民族解放战争的胜利，民主主义革命的彻底胜利，和社会主义革命的基本胜利。一部共产党的英勇斗争的胜利历史，就是一部先烈的鲜血写成的历史。中国人民要求中国共产党的领导，是根据历史说话的。人们是从历史走过来的，普通的工人、农民、革命的知识分子和一切爱国人士，都懂得这一条最基本的道理。当资产阶级右派扬言并采取实际行动来削弱、摆脱和取消共产党的领导的时候，我们应当响亮地回答：我们要加强共产党的领导，要以实际行动，从各个方面，想尽一切办法，来坚决加强共产党的领导。不这么做，依了资产阶级右派分子的话，就要亡国，人民就要坠入万劫不复的黑暗的深渊。
      一定要向右走就会成为政治垃圾
    我想在这里向资产阶级右派分子讲几句话。你们当中一些人，在过去，特别是在民主革命时期，都曾程度不同地、多少不一地为人民作了些好事。为人民作了好事，人民当然不会忘记，你们今天有为人民工作的机会，就是人民给予的最公允的酬答。但是，好事要继续作下去，要作到底，如果不作到底，半途而废，甚或反其道而行，挖共产党的底，挖社会主义的墙脚，就会激起人民的反对，遭到人民的唾弃。昨天作了好事，今天作了大混蛋的事，人民就不能承允。近百年的中国历史，对于全国人民，对于所有的政治活动家，是一部最好的教科书。每一次大变革、大震荡、大运动之后，同路人之中，除了绝大部分随着历史前进之外，总还有一部分抛戈弃甲，落荒而走，最终变成暗泣于阴沟中的废料。这是一条铁的规律，任谁也逃不掉这条无情的客观规律的考验。谁是真正的革命者，谁是两面派的投机分子，在这条规律面前会要作出事实的、历史的结论。现在又临到这么一个尖锐的时刻了，每一个人都要毫不含糊地回答这个问题：向右走，还是向左走？走资本主义道路，还是走社会主义道路？站稳资本主义立场，还是站稳社会主义立场？前者是死胡同，此路不通，一定要走，就会变成政治垃圾。后者是六亿人民选择的光明大道，跟着人民走这条大道，就能克服障碍，步入佳境。奉劝走前一条道路的右派分子们：人不可能不犯错误，“知过能改，善莫大焉”。社会主义改造的大门对你们始终是敞开着的，只要憣然悔悟，改弦更张，老老实实把你们反共、反社会主义的浊秽的思想，丑恶的“私房话”，见不得人的密谋策划，原原本本，清清楚楚，干干净净，彻彻底底地向人民交代，向社会交代，同时也以实际行动来揭露别的右派分子，这就表明自己有决心从右转向左，从反动转向革命。昨天作了坏事，今天转变过来作好事，人民是能够宽恕的。如果一意孤行，坚持反动立场，以自己的恶言恶行来破坏社会主义事业，触犯刑律，那就表明自己自外于人民，自绝于人民，从人民方面转化到人民的敌人方面去了。这种人的这种作法，人民是不会答应的，是要办罪的。
    在反右派的尖锐斗争中，在这样一个不平凡的时刻，我愿意做一个平凡的战士。我不过是一个老年的新兵，但我坚决和右派分子划清界限，为社会主义事业效力，紧紧地跟着历史前进！
