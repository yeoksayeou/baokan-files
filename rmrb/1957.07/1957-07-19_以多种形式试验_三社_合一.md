    Experimenting with the "Three Cooperatives" Integration in Various Forms
    Ma Chengli
    After reading your newspaper's July 7th report on the "Three Cooperatives" integration, I would like to offer some personal views.
    After agricultural collectivization, there are indeed many problems among the rural "Three Cooperatives." The "Three Cooperatives" each have their own organizational and meeting systems, and the directors, supervisors, committee members, representatives, and group leaders of the supply and marketing and credit cooperatives are mostly leading members of the agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, the grassroots organizations of the supply and marketing and credit cooperatives have difficulty playing their roles. The separate establishment of institutions for agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives inevitably leads to conflicts in mobilizing investment by agricultural cooperatives and mobilizing deposits by credit cooperatives. The relationship between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives is not close, making it difficult to specifically grasp the needs of rural areas for production and living materials. The "Three Cooperatives" each having their own organization also makes it inconvenient for rural Party and government organizations to provide unified leadership and comprehensively organize supply and marketing and credit units to serve agricultural production.
    The above problems can be largely resolved after the "Three Cooperatives" integration is experimented with in certain townships in Nanping County, Fujian. However, due to the complexity of the rural situation and the wide range of issues involved, there are still many problems worth studying carefully in the process of promoting or trying it out.
    First, if a township has several or a dozen agricultural cooperatives, how should the "Three Cooperatives" be "integrated"? If three or five agricultural cooperatives jointly establish a supply and marketing and credit institution, there may be fewer problems with the supply and marketing cooperative, but there will be more problems with the credit cooperative. For example, agricultural cooperatives with more deposits may be afraid of suffering losses and prefer to mobilize investment on their own. In terms of loans, everyone wants to borrow more or use them equally. Since it is a joint credit cooperative (department), the director, deputy director, and members of the board of supervisors must take care of each agricultural cooperative. In this way, it is necessary to run to several agricultural cooperatives for instructions on one matter, and it is also difficult to convene meetings. Furthermore, although setting up a supply and marketing and credit institution in each agricultural cooperative can conveniently solve the problems of the masses, it will inevitably increase personnel. How can the wage expenditure be solved? Do these institutions have so many things to do?
    Second, the economic conditions of each agricultural cooperative are different. If each agricultural cooperative sets up a credit institution, it will be difficult to adjust funds. Because the areas with poor economic conditions have small capital potential for the masses and cannot absorb many deposits. On the contrary, there may be more households requiring loans, and the credit departments will be unable to support the living needs of the masses. In areas with better economic conditions, the capital potential of the masses is large, and they may absorb more deposits. It is more troublesome to transfer deposits to the bank and then lend them to agricultural cooperatives with poor economic conditions through the bank.
    Third, after the supply and marketing cooperative and the agricultural cooperative merge their institutions, there may be a large number of sales on credit, which will affect the capital turnover of the supply and marketing cooperative. For example, some cooperative members borrow money from the agricultural cooperative to buy daily necessities, but the agricultural cooperative does not have money to advance, so it will issue a slip to allow the cooperative members to pick up the goods from the supply and marketing department. The same situation may occur in the purchase of production materials in agricultural cooperatives.
    Fourth, the work foundation of agricultural cooperatives varies, and the leadership strength of agricultural cooperatives also varies. After the "Three Cooperatives" are integrated, agricultural cooperatives with a good foundation and strong leadership may strengthen leadership and comprehensively organize the supply and marketing and credit departments to serve agricultural production. However, will the merger of supply and marketing and credit institutions in agricultural cooperatives with weak leadership weaken the leadership of agricultural production?
    Based on the above issues, I believe that the experiment or promotion of the "Three Cooperatives" integration should be carried out in various forms of experiments according to different regions and different situations. For example, not only should experiments be conducted in townships with only one agricultural cooperative, supply and marketing cooperative, and credit cooperative, but also in townships with several or a dozen agricultural cooperatives; experiments can be conducted in agricultural cooperatives with better working conditions, and also in individual agricultural cooperatives with poor working conditions; experiments can be conducted in the form of setting up a supply and marketing and credit institution in one agricultural cooperative, and also in the form of several agricultural cooperatives jointly forming a supply and marketing and credit institution; the "Three Cooperatives" can be in the form of unified organizational leadership only, or in the form of turning the supply and marketing and credit cooperatives into a department of the agricultural cooperative like in Anhui Province (that is, all handed over to the agricultural cooperative to run, and the supply and marketing department is engaged in distribution and consignment sales, from which a certain amount of handling fee is obtained); because the business nature of supply and marketing and credit is different, the two can be unified for experiments, or the two can be separated for experiments.
    I believe that through experiments in various regions and various forms, and then a systematic summary, and then promotion or trial implementation on a larger scale.

### 以多种形式试验“三社”合一

    以多种形式试验“三社”合一
    马成礼
    你报7月7日关于“三社”合一的报道读后，我想提出一些个人看法。
    农业合作化之后，农村“三社”之间，确有不少问题。“三社”各有一套组织、会议制度，而供销、信用社的理、监事委员和代表、小组长，又多是农业社的领导骨干，因此供销、信用社的基层组织很难发挥作用；农业社、供销社和信用社单独成立机构，势必在农业社动员投资和信用社动员存款方面发生矛盾，供销社与农业社关系不密切，难于具体掌握农村对生产、生活资料的需要情况；“三社”各有一套组织，也不便于农村党政组织统一领导，不便于全面组织供销、信用单位为农业生产服务。
    上述问题，在福建南平县某些乡试验的“三社”合一后，大体可以解决。但是，由于农村情况复杂，这个问题牵扯面又广，在推行或试办过程中，还有不少问题是值得仔细研究的。
    第一、一个乡有好几个或十几个农业社，“三社”怎么“合”法？如果三、五个农业社联合成立一个供销、信用机构，供销社的问题可能少些，而信用社的问题就比较多。例如存款多的农业社，可能怕吃亏，不如自己动员投资好些；在贷款方面都想多借点或平均分配使用；既是联合信用社（部），理、监事委员会的主任、副主任、委员，就要照顾各农业社，这样，一件事情要跑几个农业社去请示，召集会议也很困难。再说，每个农业社都设立一个供销、信用机构，虽可便利解决群众的问题，但是必然要增加人员，工资开支如何解决？这些机构是否有那么多事情可作？
    第二，各农业社的经济条件不同，如果每个农业社设一个信用机构，在资金调剂方面，就会发生困难。因为经济条件差的地区，群众的资金潜力小，吸收不了多少存款，相反，要求贷款的户可能多，信用部门则无力支持群众的生活需要，而经济条件较好的地区，群众资金潜力大，吸收存款可能多，如果把存款转存银行，通过银行转贷给经济条件差的农业社，就比较麻烦。
    第三，供销社和农业社合并机构之后，可能出现大量赊销、影响供销社资金周转的现象。如有些社员到农业社借钱买生活用品，而农业社没钱预支，就会批条子让社员到供销部门去取货。在农业社购买生产资料方面，也可能发生同样情况。
    第四，农业社工作基础有好差之别，农业社的领导力量也有强弱之分。基础好和领导力量强的农业社，在“三社”合一之后，可能加强领导，全面组织供销、信用部门为农业生产服务。但领导力量弱的农业社，把供销、信用机构合并起来，是否会削弱对农业生产的领导？
    根据上述的一些问题，我认为试验或推行“三社”合一，应该根据不同地区，不同情况，进行多种形式的试验。例如不只在一乡只有一个农业社、供销社、信用社的乡试验，也要在有数个或十几个农业社的乡进行试验；可以在工作条件较好的农业社试验，也可以在个别工作条件差的农业社试验；可以在一个农业社设一个供销、信用机构的形式试验，也可以以几个农业社联合组成一个供销、信用机构的形式试验；可以使“三社”只是组织领导统一的形式，也可以像安徽省那样，把供销、信用社变为农业社的一个部的形式来试验（即全部交给农业社办，供销部是经销、代销，从中取得一定数量的手续费）；因为供销与信用两者的业务性质不同，可以把两者统一进行试验，也可以把两者分开进行试验。
    我认为，通过各种地区，各种形式的试验，而后再加以系统的总结，再推行或在更大规模上试办。
