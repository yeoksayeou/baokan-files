Xinhua News Agency, London, July 17th: Signs of inflation in the British economy have caused widespread unease in the country. Continuously rising prices are further hitting the lives of ordinary people.

According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Labour on the 16th, the cost of living index rose by one point in June, reaching 106 points (based on the January 1956 index as 100).

At the same time, the London stock market is showing instability. Government bond prices have fallen to their lowest level in thirty-five years.

Labour Party economic affairs spokesman Wilson recently said at a rally that people's confidence in the purchasing power of the pound has fallen to "the lowest point in history." He said that rising prices and the state of government bonds in the past two weeks indicate that Britain is already in "a most dangerous situation."

It is revealed that there are serious differences of opinion within the Conservative Party and the Cabinet on how to curb inflation. Because freezing wages, cutting social spending, or increasing taxes would all be unpopular, it would lead to the Conservative Party's defeat in the next general election.

    英国通货膨胀物价上升  保守党和内阁一筹莫展
    据新华社17日讯  伦敦消息：英国经济中出现的通货膨胀迹象已经在国内引起广泛的不安。继续上涨的物价使普通人的生活进一步受到打击。
    据英国劳工部16日宣布，生活费用指数在6月份上涨了一点，达到了一百零六点（以1956年1月份的指数为一百）。
    同时，伦敦股票市场呈现不稳。政府公债的价格下降到了三十五年以来的最低水平。
    工党经济问题发言人威尔逊最近在一次集会上说，人们对于英镑购买力的信心已经下降到“历来的最低点”，他说，两周来物价的上涨和政府公债的行情表明，英国已经处于“一种最危险的境地”。
    据透露，保守党和内阁内部在如何制止通货膨胀的问题上存在着严重的意见分歧。因为无论是冻结工资、削减社会事业经费或者是增加税收，都将是不得人心的，因此将会招致保守党在下届大选中的失败。
