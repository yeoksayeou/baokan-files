    Soviet Collective Farm Self-Funded Schools
    Because of the continuous increase in economic strength, many collective farms in the Soviet Union have decided to use their own funds to build schools. Recently, thirty-five collective farms in the Grozny Oblast held general meetings of all members and decided to build a total of forty primary and secondary schools by the end of 1958. Many collective farms have already fulfilled their promises and broken ground. The collective farms in the Grozny Oblast are preparing to build fifteen schools before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution as a gift to the great festival.
    The Grozny Oblast Party Committee strongly supports these collective farms' initiative and directs the local Party and government organs to help the collective farms solve problems such as the supply of materials.

    苏联农庄自力盖学校
    苏联集体农庄因为经济力量的不断上升，很多农庄都决定要用自己的资金盖学校。最近，格罗兹念州有三十五个集体农庄开了全体庄员大会，决定到1958年年底一共建设四十所中小学校。许多农庄都已实现自己的诺言，破土动工了。格罗兹念州的农庄准备在十月革命四十周年以前建好十五所学校，作为对伟大节日的献礼。
    格罗兹念州党委大力支持这些农庄的创举并让当地的党政机关帮助农庄解决材料供应等问题。
