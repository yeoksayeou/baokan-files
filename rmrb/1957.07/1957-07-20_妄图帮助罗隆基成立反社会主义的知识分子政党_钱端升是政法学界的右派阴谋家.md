It is reported that the China Political Science and Law Society and the teachers and students of the Beijing College of Political Science and Law have held gatherings in recent days to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Qian Duansheng. Qian Duansheng is the president of Beijing College of Political Science and Law and the vice president of the China Political Science and Law Society. Before and after the rectification campaign, his language and actions in attacking the Party were consistent with the Zhang-Luo alliance. He carried out a series of instigations and incitements in the field of politics and law, conspiring to usurp the Party's leadership over political and legal work and political and legal education, and to change the socialist direction of legal work and political and legal education, so that it would embark on the old road of the bourgeoisie.

Had long harbored the sinister intention of confronting the Communist Party on an equal footing

Teachers and students of Beijing College of Political Science and Law revealed that Qian Duansheng had been carrying out anti-Party activities covertly even before the rectification campaign. Professor Xu Dunzhang said that Qian Duansheng had long harbored sinister intentions. After Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals, Qian Duansheng and Luo Longji jointly invited members of various universities to eat at the Cultural Club and to discuss the arrangements for veteran intellectuals. What were they doing this for? Under everyone's criticism and questioning, Qian Duansheng admitted: "Luo Longji posed as a great old intellectual. After the Premier's report on the issue of intellectuals came out, he suggested forming an intellectual issue group to find out about the situation of intellectuals and take the opportunity to form an intellectual party in order to confront the Communist Party on an equal footing. Luo Longji said that he was not familiar with intellectuals in the field of politics and law and wanted me to find some people with problems and emotions to talk to, so I made a list." He said that this was exactly the method of forming connections suggested by Fei Xiaotong.

Since then, Qian Duansheng has also made a great deal of fuss about how to win over intellectuals to confront the Party. After the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he suddenly became interested in the work of the school, disregarding the summary report of the inspection work prepared by the school Party committee, and convened a series of symposiums for faculty and staff, asking everyone to only talk about shortcomings and not about achievements. Zhou Ren, who had been "won over and utilized" by Qian Duansheng, said: "The purpose of Qian Duansheng's convening these symposiums was to start another set of things to confront the Party; and by encouraging everyone to give opinions on the shortcomings of the school, to prove that the work of the school was a mess, and also to win over the teachers."

Qian Duansheng is a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and the chairman of the Beijing College of Political Science and Law branch of the China Democratic League. He is usually very unconcerned about the work of the League, but at this time he suddenly became active. Liu Yuzhong, a member of the China Democratic League, said: "In February of this year, Qian Duansheng suddenly wanted to hold a meeting to discuss why the China Democratic League had developed so slowly in the past few years and had not played a significant role. He was eager to develop League members among senior intellectuals." Yu Zhenpeng, the organization committee member of the China Democratic League, revealed that the reason why he was so active was to use the China Democratic League organization as his political capital to confront the leadership of the Party. Lou Bangyan, who called himself "a person in Qian Duansheng's pocket," also said: Qian Duansheng had long wanted to merge the Jiusan Society, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the China Democratic League of the College of Political Science and Law to form a large democratic party to confront the Communist Party.

Starting fires everywhere, openly inciting, and individually wooing

After the rectification campaign began, Qian Duansheng started fires everywhere, openly incited, and individually wooed, trying to create public opinion and make the world chaotic.

Lecturer Du Ruji was criticized in the campaign to eliminate counter-revolutionaries for having serious wrong ideas. Qian Duansheng thought he had an opportunity and provoked him. Du Ruji said he was unwilling to talk about this issue, and Qian Duansheng said with ulterior motives: "The campaign to eliminate counter-revolutionaries is about dealing with counter-revolutionaries, and ideological criticism has gone beyond the scope." When Du Ruji asked about the issue of evaluating academic titles, he took the opportunity to provoke again: "The Party leadership did not give you the title at first, but I insisted on it. If I didn't speak for you, you wouldn't even be able to teach."

A student named Zhang Wenyue often expressed fallacies in class, and Qian Duansheng immediately added fuel to the fire. Zhang asked him whether the Party's mistakes could be criticized, and he immediately replied: "What are you talking about? Even if the Party Central Committee is wrong, you should oppose it!" On May 20, Zhang sent Qian a letter with a strong "Cao Mu Pian" flavor, describing today's society as a dark mess, saying that upright people would be battered and bruised, squeezed out, and even forced to death, while flatterers would be trusted. Qian replied to Zhang on May 22, taking a strong supporting attitude towards this reactionary statement, telling him "to be rich and not lewd, poor and not moved, and mighty and not bent."

After the rectification campaign began, rightists spread rumors in the school, saying that when assigning graduates, Party members were all assigned as judges, and non-Party members could only be assigned as clerks, which caused ideological confusion among some students. Qian Duansheng immediately seized this opportunity to stir up trouble, trying to instigate students to make trouble. He first said at a symposium: There is serious sectarianism in the use of intellectuals in the political and legal departments, and university graduates are not given due importance; almost all of the 1954 graduates from our school who went to Tianjin did not engage in political and legal work. Then, at a movie night, he said to the students: Graduates of the College of Political Science and Law should be judges, but it was okay to be a clerk back then, but being a clerk for too long is unreasonable. Now the sectarianism in the entire judicial system is very serious, and worker-peasant cadres suppress intellectuals, and veteran cadres suppress new cadres. If you don't eliminate the "three evils" this time, you may be a clerk for the rest of your life.

Under the criticism and questioning of teachers and students, Qian Duansheng was unable to justify some of the contradictions he created. He said that Du Ruji was talking nonsense. Du asked him: Then what did you say we talked about? He couldn't answer. He said that the reply to Zhang Wenyue's letter was written in response to another letter. Zhang Wenyue said that he had only written one letter to Qian Duansheng. Qian Duansheng hurriedly changed his words, saying that he had written the reply without reading the contents of the letter. Regarding the issue of graduate assignment, someone specifically calculated the accounts of the sixteen people who were assigned to Tianjin in 1954: a total of twelve people worked in political and legal work in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, judicial administration departments, courts, and procuratorates, and non-Party members and non-League members accounted for the majority, and only four people did other work for other reasons. How can it be said that "almost all did not engage in political and legal work"? The facts could not be denied at all, and Qian Duansheng had no choice but to admit that he was "shamelessly fabricating facts, deliberately slandering the leadership of the Party, and spreading dissatisfaction with the Party."

Provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses, and forcibly dividing Party members into factions

At the preparatory meeting for the symposium of the Political Science and Law Society, Qian Duansheng echoed Chu Anping's "Party World," accusing "political and legal organs of having serious 'sectarianism'," and that "relatively responsible non-Party comrades are rare," and that they "have become monolithic," and therefore loudly called for "opening up now" so that old legal personnel could "take the stage" as "leaders." At the symposium at the school, Qian Duansheng said that it was impossible for the College of Political Science and Law to eliminate the three isms, because the school's leading organs—the state's political and legal departments and the Ministry of Education—had serious problems, one was serious sectarianism, and the other was serious dogmatism. If the above does not strictly eliminate these shortcomings, it will be difficult for our school to eliminate the "three evils" in isolation. Many people refuted him in their speeches, saying that Qian Duansheng's sensational remarks were to open a gap in the political and legal departments, allowing old legal personnel to "take the stage" in order to usurp the Party's leadership over the political and legal departments.

At the school's trade union congress, Qian Duansheng even claimed: "How trade unions in institutions of higher learning accept the leadership of the Party has not yet been clearly stated." He also said: "Trade unions should care about the lives and thoughts of the masses, and support the correct opinions of the masses. For example, there is a member in our college who has been requesting to join the Party since coming to the College of Political Science and Law, but it has not been resolved. At this time, the trade union should play an adjudicative role and objectively and fairly offer opinions to the Party." Teachers and students indignantly questioned him: "As the chairman of the Beijing Education Trade Union, why does Qian Duansheng spread such extremely wrong remarks? This is his conscious attempt to pull the trade union out and away from the leadership of the Party. The so-called 'trade union should play an adjudicative role' is even more of an attempt to place the trade union above the Party, rather than requiring the trade union to work under the leadership of the Party."

In order to exclude the Party's leadership over the school, Qian Duansheng invited people's representatives to inspect the school before the rectification campaign, revealing the meaning that "the Party committee system does not work in the school," and publicly advocated this after the rectification campaign began; on the one hand, he forcibly divided Party members into factions, undermining the unity of the Party. He said in his speech at the professors' symposium: "There is too much sectarianism within the Party. There are Party members from three sources, and those who came from the Revolutionary University are in a leading position among the three batches of Party members." Later, he said: "Party members from the Revolutionary University have become a core of our school, and Party members from the four universities, such as Yu Shutong, have been squeezed out, not to mention the masses." And he added a fabricated sentence: "The Municipal Party Committee is determined to break up the core of the Revolutionary University in the rectification campaign." Professor Dai Keguang revealed the vicious intention of his spreading these words, saying: "He divided our school's Party members into three categories and said that their contradictions are very serious, and wanted intellectual Party members to pour out their grievances. In fact, he wanted to pull intellectual Party members out of the Party."

Many people pointed out in their speeches that Qian Duansheng has always used two-faced tactics towards the Party: flattering on the surface and scolding behind his back. At the preparatory meeting for the symposium of the Political Science and Law Society, he advocated that the Party should "open up" to old legal personnel. He was indignant that the Party had not absorbed him and Lou Bangyan, Yu Zhenpeng, etc. into the Party, pretending to be speaking for the old intellectuals with a compassionate appearance. And it was this Yu Zhenpeng who revealed Qian Duansheng's bottom line at the symposium of the Political Science and Law Society. Yu Zhenpeng said that Qian Duansheng had never talked about the benefits of the Party and Party members, but he talked a lot about the shortcomings. Another member of the China Democratic League of the College of Political Science and Law revealed that Qian Duansheng proposed at the League branch meeting that League members should often understand the shortcomings of the responsible Party cadres in the school and report the collected shortcomings directly to the League Municipal Committee and the League Central Committee. Someone advocated that the situation should be discussed and studied jointly with the college Party committee, and he said sternly that he knew that some people wanted to join the Party and were unwilling to offend the college Party committee.

Planning to overturn the original department adjustments and curriculum reforms

In terms of political and legal education, Qian Duansheng has his own set of plans. Chen Guangzhong of the College of Political Science and Law, Professor Rui Mu of Peking University, Gong Xiangrui, and others revealed that Qian Duansheng was very dissatisfied with the department adjustments. At that time, in order to resist the implementation of the department adjustment policy, he held meetings with Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang at Tsinghua University to discuss countermeasures, and also convened some professors at Lou Bangyan's home to secretly discuss how to resist. Afterwards, he advocated disrupting the new departments after the department adjustments and carrying out "department re-adjustments," overturning the curriculum reforms led by the Communist Party, and carrying out a "second thorough reform."

In his "review," Qian Duansheng flatly denied that he had such a proposition. However, Professor Gong Xiangrui confirmed in several speeches: I heard the news of "department re-adjustments" three times. After explaining in detail the time, place, and people present at the three times he heard it, Gong Xiangrui said again: "It can be said that there are three plans: one is to merge the law department of the People's University into the law department of Peking University to create a law school; the second is to merge the law departments of the People's University and Peking University into the College of Political Science and Law to establish a law school; the third is to merge the law departments of the People's University and Peking University with the Central Political and Legal Cadre School into the College of Political Science and Law to establish a large law school of Peking University, with Mr. Qian as the vice president and dean of the law school. The essence of the entire plan is to overturn the original department reforms and carry out a new department reform."

A scholar who deceives the world and steals fame—a right-wing conspirator in the field of politics and law

Qian Duansheng touted himself as a "rare talent in the field of politics and law," but what kind of scholar is he? Li Zuyin, a counselor of the State Council, said: Qian Duansheng made his fortune with the "Comparative Constitution" co-authored with Wang Shijie, but this book is just a "predatory" work. Qian Duansheng boasted to others that he had "three great generals" and "three musketeers"—his student, Professor Gong Xiangrui of Peking University, Wang Tieya, and Lou Bangyan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice. Gong Xiangrui, who has recognized Qian Duansheng's sinister face since the Three-Anti Campaign, said when talking about Qian Duansheng's learning: "Comparative Constitution" was written by Wang Shijie, not by Qian Duansheng. It must also be pointed out that Comparative Constitution is not Wang Shijie's creation either, but a replica of Esman's work. Qian's other works, such as "The Government of France," etc., were written under certain special conditions and not out of a love of learning. "History of the Political System of the Republic of China" was written by him organizing people. Is Qian Duansheng's academic level high? His disciples touted him to the outside world, but cursed him as worthless behind his back. For example, Lou Bangyan said that Qian Duansheng's is empty formal narration without any personal opinions; Wang Tieya said that Qian Duansheng is stupid and indigestible. Gong Xiangrui also said: Qian Duansheng is not a scholar, but has always been a politician wearing the cloak of a scholar.

Professors Dai Keguang, Gong Xiangrui, Rui Mu, and others also pointed out that Qian Duansheng's standing on the right-wing anti-Party position is not surprising from his history and ideological origins.

They pointed out that after Qian Duansheng returned to China from studying in the United States in 1924, he joined Wang Shijie's academic warlord group, which monopolized political and legal education at that time, and controlled the political and legal departments of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Wuhan University, and other schools, and spread anti-communist and anti-people remarks in the "Modern Review" run by Wang Shijie, saying that "only the Kuomintang can exist in China" and that "the Communist Party is an obvious enemy." Before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, Qian Duansheng very much wanted to become an official, and Wang Shijie recommended him to serve as the Vice Minister of Education of the Kuomintang government and the Minister to Australia, but he did not get Chiang Kai-shek's approval. So he ran "Today's Review," supporting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, and shouting that "the Red Army and its border area government should abolish their special organizations" in order to "implement the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship." In 1948, Qian Duansheng went to the United States to lecture. He also telegraphed to contact the Chinese Society for Social and Economic Research to prepare the "New Road" magazine, and wanted Lou Bangyan to serve as his editor, promoting the reactionary middle line. On the eve of liberation, Qian Duansheng returned to Beijing from the United States. The Party and the people did not bear old grudges and trusted him very much, but he did not seriously reform himself and still colluded with right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, waiting for an opportunity to carry out reactionary activities.

Qian Duansheng himself talked about his relationship with Luo Longji at the symposium of the Political Science and Law Society, saying: "Luo Longji and I both graduated from Tsinghua University and studied in the United States. I knew him when I was at Tsinghua University. During the Kuomintang Senate period in Chongqing, I interacted with him more frequently. After liberation, during the North China People's Government period, it is said that Luo considered setting up an institution, with him and me. Now that I think about it, he was obviously trying to win me over."

Talking about his relationship with Zhang Bojun, Qian Duansheng said: "Zhang often said that the League attaches importance to senior intellectuals, and some senior intellectuals should be promoted by three levels, such as Qian Duansheng." Due to Zhang Bojun's favor, Qian Duansheng was quickly promoted to a member of the Central Standing Committee after joining the China Democratic League in 1952. Qian Duansheng also said: "On March 12 this year, Zhang Bojun invited me, Zeng Zhaolun, Wu Jingchao, Fei Xiaotong, and others to dinner, saying that the China Democratic League is a political organization and should discuss national affairs. I admired him very much and felt that he had grasped the situation. We also talked about the issue of the bicameral system this time." Qian Duansheng said: "I was caught by them. They think I am a member of their small group." But Qian Duansheng repeatedly argued that he "did not participate in the Zhang-Luo alliance organizationally," but only "had a common tendency in thought" and "did not have as much ambition as Zhang and Luo."

However, Li Zuyin, a counselor of the State Council, questioned Qian Duansheng at the symposium of the political and legal circles: "Yang Qingyuan, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, told me that Zhang Bojun himself said that when he invited Qian Duansheng to dinner, he discussed the issues of the 'Political Design Institute' and the 'bicameral system' with Qian Duansheng in detail. How did you plan in secret?" Ma Zhemin also said at the group meeting of the National People's Congress: "Qian Duansheng is Zhang Bojun's adviser on the national system." According to Fei Xiaotong, on June 2, when the rightists were frantically attacking the Party, Qian Duansheng told Fei: "Anyway, I will follow Vice Chairman Luo." On July 2, Wu Han, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and the chairman of Beijing, made a report at the Beijing College of Political Science and Law, also saying that Qian Duansheng was a figure in Luo Longji's "invisible group" and "planning in secret."

### 妄图帮助罗隆基成立反社会主义的知识分子政党  钱端升是政法学界的右派阴谋家

    妄图帮助罗隆基成立反社会主义的知识分子政党
    钱端升是政法学界的右派阴谋家
    本报讯  中国政治法律学会和北京政法学院师生连日来举行集会，对右派分子钱端升的反动言行进行了揭露和批判。钱端升是北京政法学院院长、中国政治法律学会副会长。在整风前后，他和章罗联盟向党进攻的语言和行动相一致，在政法方面进行一系列的挑拨煽惑活动，阴谋篡夺党对政法工作和政法教育的领导权，改变法制工作和政法教育的社会主义方向，使其走上资产阶级的老路。
    早已怀有同共产党分庭抗礼的鬼胎
    北京政法学院的师生们揭露，钱端升早在整风以前就隐蔽地进行了反党活动。徐敦璋教授说，钱端升早已怀有鬼胎。在周总理关于知识分子问题的报告后，钱端升就与罗隆基共同具名邀请各大学的盟员在文化俱乐部吃饭和座谈老知识分子的安排问题。他们这样做是为了什么？在大家的批判和质问下，钱端升承认：“罗隆基以知识分子的大好老自居。总理关于知识分子问题的报告出来以后，他建议成立知识分子问题小组，摸摸知识分子的情况，乘机成立知识分子政党，以便与共产党分庭抗礼。罗隆基说他对政法界知识分子不熟悉，要我找一些有问题有情绪的人在一起谈谈，我就开了一个名单。”他说，这正是用的费孝通所建议的串连办法。
    自此以后，钱端升也就在如何拉拢知识分子同党对抗上大做起文章来了。中共“八大”以后，他忽然对学校工作感到兴趣了，抛开学校党委准备好的检查工作的总结报告不顾，自己召开了一系列的教职员工座谈会，要大家只讲缺点，不讲成绩。曾被钱端升“拉拢和利用”过的周仁说：“钱端升召开这些座谈会的目的，在于另搞一套，与党对抗；并通过鼓励大家对学校的缺点提意见来证明学校的工作是一团糟，也可借此对教员进行拉拢。”
    钱端升是民盟中央常务委员，北京政法学院民盟区分部主委，平常对盟的工作很不关心，这时也忽然积极起来了。民盟盟员刘裕中说：“今年2月，钱端升突然一股劲儿要开会，讨论为什么民盟这几年发展得这样慢，起的作用不大。他急急于要在高级知识分子里发展盟员。”民盟组织委员于振鹏揭露，他之所以这样积极，是想把民盟组织当作自己对抗党的领导的政治资本。自称为钱端升“口袋中的人”的楼邦彦也说：钱端升早就想把政法学院的九三学社、民主促进会和民主同盟合并起来，成立一个大民主党派与共产党相对抗。
    四处点火，公开煽动，个别拉拢
    整风开始后，钱端升就四处点火，公开煽动，个别拉拢，企图造成舆论，使天下大乱。
    讲师杜汝楫在肃反中因有严重的错误思想受到了批判，钱端升以为有机可乘，就对他进行挑拨，杜汝楫表示不愿谈这个问题，钱端升便别有用心地说：“肃反是搞反革命，思想批判超过了范围。”杜汝楫问到评学衔的问题，他又借机挑拨说：“党的领导方面不给你评，后来我坚持才评了，不是我替你说话，你连书也教不成了。”
    有个学生叫章文岳，经常在班中发表谬论，钱端升立即接上了火种。章问他党的错误是否可以批评，他立刻答道：“这算什么话，党中央错了，也要反对！”5月20日章致钱一封信，大有“草木篇”之味，把今天的社会说成一团黑，说正直的人会碰得头破血流，受到排挤，甚至被迫至死，而阿谀奉承者却能得到信任。钱在5月22日复章一信，对这种反动言论采取大力支持的态度，叫他“要做到富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”。
    整风开始后，右派分子在学校散布谎言，说在分配毕业生时，党员都分配作审判员，非党员只能作书记员，这引起了部分学生的思想混乱。钱端升立即抓住这个机会来拨弄是非，企图鼓动学生闹事。他始而在座谈会上说：政法部门使用知识分子方面有严重的宗派主义，大学毕业生得不到应有的重视；我校1954年毕业生去天津的几乎全没搞政法工作。继而在电影晚会上向学生们说：政法学院毕业者应该当审判员，但是当年把书记员也可以，不过当书记员太长不合理。现在整个司法界宗派主义非常严重，工农干部压知识分子，老干部压新干部。你们这次如果不把“三害”反掉，将来可能当一辈子书记员。
    在师生们的批判和质问之下，钱端升对自己制造的一些矛盾无法自圆其说。他说杜汝楫是胡说八道。杜反问他：那你说我们都谈了些什么呢？他答不上来。他说复章文岳的信是针对另一封信写的。章文岳说他只给钱端升写过一封信。钱端升忙又改口说他没看信的内容就写了回信。关于毕业生的分配问题，有人对1954年分配到天津去的十六个人具体算了账：计到市公安局、司法行政部门、法院、检察院等部门作政法工作的有十二人，非党团员占多数，只有四人因其它原因作了别的工作。这怎么能说“几乎全没有搞政法工作”呢？事实一点也不容抵赖了，钱端升才不得不承认他是“无耻地捏造事实，有意污蔑党的领导，散布对党的不满情绪”。
    挑拨党群关系，硬把党员分成宗派
    在政法学会座谈会的预备会上，钱端升与储安平的“党天下”遥相呼应，指责“政法机关有严重的“宗派主义”，“较负责的非党同志很少”，“变成清一色”，因而大声疾呼“现在要开放”，让旧法人员“上台”当“头儿”。在学校的座谈会上，钱端升说，政法学院不可能整掉三个主义，因为学校的领导机关——国家的政法部门和教育部有严重的问题，一个是严重的宗派主义，一个是严重的教条主义。如果上边不严格去掉这些毛病，我校孤立地除“三害”是很困难的。许多人在发言中驳斥他说，钱端升这些耸人听闻的言论，就是要在政法部门打开一个缺口，让旧法人员“上台”，以篡夺党对政法部门的领导权。
    在学校工会代表大会上，钱端升竟然声称：“高等学校中的工会如何接受党的领导还没有得到确切的提法”。又说：“工会应关心群众的生活、思想，支持群众正确的意见。例如，我院有一个会员，自从来政法学院以来一直要求入党，但未得解决，这时工会应该起公断作用，客观公平地对党提意见。”师生们愤慨地责问他道：“作为北京市教育工会主席的钱端升，为什么要散播这种极端错误的言论呢？这是他有意识地想把工会拉出去，离开党的领导。所谓‘工会应起公断作用’，更是想把工会放在党之上，而不是要工会在党的领导下工作。”
    钱端升为了排挤党对学校的领导，一面在整风以前邀请人民代表来校视察，透露“党委制在学校行不通”的意思，在整风开始后又公开如此主张；一面硬把党员分成派系，破坏党的团结。他在教授座谈会发言中说：“党内宗派主义太多。有三方面来的党员，在三批党员中处于领导地位的是革大来的。”以后又说：“来自革大的党员成为我们学校的一个核心，四个大学的党员，像余叔通等都受到排挤，群众更不用说了。”而且无中生有地加上一句：“市委有决心在整风中打散革大的核心。”戴克光教授揭露了他散布这些话的恶毒用意说：“他把我校党员分成三类，并说他们的矛盾很厉害，要知识分子党员吐苦水，其实就是要把知识分子党员从党内拉出来。”
    许多人在发言中指出，钱端升对党向来是耍两面手法的：表面恭维，背地骂娘。他在政法学界座谈会的预备会上，主张党要向旧法人员“开放”，对于党没有吸收他以及楼邦彦、于振鹏等入党愤愤不平，装出替老知识分子说话的悲天悯人的样子。而正是这个于振鹏，在政法学界的座谈会上，透了钱端升的底。于振鹏说，钱端升从来没谈过党和党员的好处，对缺点则谈的很多。政法学院的另一个盟员揭露，钱端升在盟支部会上，提出要盟员经常了解学校中党员负责干部的缺点，并把所搜集到的缺点直接报告盟市委和盟中央。有人主张应将了解的情况和院党委共同商量研究，他疾言厉色地说，我知道有些人想入党，不愿得罪院党委。
    打算推翻原来的院系调整和课程改革
    在政法教育方面，钱端升自有一套方案计划。政法学院陈光中、北大教授芮沐、龚祥瑞等揭露，钱端升对院系调整是十分不满意的，当时为了抗拒院系调整方针的贯彻，曾在清华大学和曾昭抡、钱伟长开会共商对策，又在楼邦彦家里召集一些教授密议如何抗拒。事后他主张打乱院系调整后的新院系，来个“院系再调整”，推翻共产党领导的课程改革，来个“二次彻底改革”。
    钱端升在他的“检讨”里，矢口否认他有过这样的主张。但是，龚祥瑞教授在几次发言中证实说：我三次耳闻“院系再调整”的消息。龚祥瑞在详细说明三次听到的时间、地点和在场的人后，又说：“可以说有三个方案：一个是将人大法律系归并到北大法律系，搞一个法学院；第二个是将人大、北大法律系归并到政法学院，成立法学院；第三个是将人大、北大法律系加上中央政法干校，归并到政法学院，成立为北大的大法学院，钱先生当副校长兼法学院院长。整个方案的实质就是推翻原来的院系改革，重搞一个院系改革。”
    欺世盗名的学者——政法学界的右派阴谋家
    钱端升自诩为“政法界的凤毛麟角”之士，但他到底是怎样一个学者呢？国务院参事李祖荫说：钱端升是靠他和王世杰合著的“比较宪法”起家的，而这本书不过是“掠夺式”的作品吧了。钱端升对人夸耀他手下有“三大将”、“三剑客”——他的学生、北大教授龚祥瑞，王铁崖，北京市司法局副局长楼邦彦。自三反以来就认识了钱端升阴险面目的龚祥瑞，在谈到钱端升的学问时说：“比较宪法”是王世杰著的，并不是钱端升著的。还必须指出，比较宪法也不是王世杰的创作，而是法国人爱斯曼著作的翻版。钱的其它著作如“法国的政府”等是在某种特殊条件下写出来的，并非出于好学。“民国政制史”是他组织人写的。钱端升的学术高不高？他的门徒对外推崇他，但背后却骂他一文不值，如楼邦彦说钱端升是空疏的形式叙述，毫无己见；王铁崖说钱端升笨，食而不化。龚祥瑞又说：钱端升不是学者，向来是个披着学者外衣的政客。
    戴克光、龚祥瑞、芮沐等教授还指出，钱端升之所以站在右派反党立场上，从他的历史上和思想根源上看，是毫不奇怪的。
    他们指出，钱端升1924年留美回国后，就参加了当时垄断政法教育的王世杰的学阀集团，把持北大、清华、武汉大学等校的政法院系，并在王世杰办的“现代评论”上散播反共反人民的言论，说什么“在中国只能有国民党能存在”，“共产党更是显而易见的敌人”。抗战前后，钱端升很想做官，王世杰便先后推荐他任国民党政府教育部次长和驻澳公使，但没有得到蒋介石的批准。于是他又办了“今日评论”，拥护蒋介石的独裁统治，大叫“红军及其边区政府应取消其特殊组织”，以便“实行国民党的一党专制”。1948年，钱端升到美国讲学，他还打电报和中国社会经济研究会联系筹办“新路”杂志，并要楼邦彦代他出任编辑，宣传反动的中间路线。解放前夕，钱端升由美国回到北京，党和人民不念旧嫌，对他非常信任，但他并未认真改造自己，仍同右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基等勾勾搭搭，伺机进行反动活动。
    钱端升自己在政法学会座谈会上谈到他与罗隆基的联系时说：“罗隆基和我同是清华毕业，留美。在清华时认得他。在重庆国民党参政会时期我同他过往较频。到了解放，在华北人民政府时期，据说罗考虑设一机构，有他也有我。现在追想，显然是在拉拢我。”
    谈到同章伯钧的关系时，钱端升说：“章经常说盟重视高级知识分子，某些高级知识分子应当连升三级，如钱端升就是。”由于受到章伯钧的青睐，钱端升果然在1952年加入民盟后，很快就升为中央常务委员。钱端升又说：“今年3月12日，章伯钧邀请我和曾昭抡、吴景超、费孝通等人吃饭，说民盟是政治组织，要对国家大事加以讨论。我对他很佩服，感到他抓住了形势。这次还谈了两院制的问题。”钱端升说：“我被他们抓住，他们认为我是他们的小集团的一个成员。”但钱端升又一再申辩他“在组织上未参加章罗联盟”，只是“思想上有共同的倾向”，“有野心也没章罗那么大”。
    可是，国务院参事李祖荫在政法界座谈会上质问钱端升道：“农工民主党中央委员杨清源告诉我，章伯钧自己说他请钱端升吃饭时，同钱端升详细商量过‘政治设计院’和‘两院制’的问题。你们是如何策划于密室的？”马哲民也在人大的小组会上说：“钱端升是章伯钧在国家制度方面的顾问。”据费孝通揭露，在6月2日，正是右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，钱端升向费表示：“我反正跟着罗副主席走”。7月2日，民盟中央常委、北京市主委吴晗到北京政法学院作报告，也说钱端升是罗隆基的“无形小组”和“策划于密室”中的人物。
