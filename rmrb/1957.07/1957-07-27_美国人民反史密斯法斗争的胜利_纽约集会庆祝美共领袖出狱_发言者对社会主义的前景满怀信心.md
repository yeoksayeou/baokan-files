Xinhua News Agency, 26th: According to TASS, New York: A mass rally was held in New York on the 24th to celebrate the release of several prominent American Communist activists from prison. Benjamin Davis, chairman of the rally, emphasized in his opening remarks that the release of the victims of the Smith Act was not only a victory for the Communists but for all the American people.

Gus Hall, editor of the "Worker's Daily," pointed out at the meeting: "The Smith Act is not dead yet." He guaranteed that the "Worker's Daily" would actively fight for the release of other victims of the Smith Act. Pettis Perry, a Black leader who was recently released from prison, also emphasized that all progressive movements in the United States must resolutely fight for the civil rights of the American people.

Eugene Dennis spoke on behalf of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States. He paid tribute to the released Communists and solemnly declared that the American Communists, "following our Marxist-Leninist principles and socialist ideas, still have confidence in the future."

William Z. Foster, a well-known activist of the Communist Party of the United States, pointed out that the socialist world is vigorously moving forward. He said: "The billions of people living in countries led by the Soviet Union have established a system that can influence our way of life and the daily lives of our people," and "The growing strength of socialist forces on the international stage also opens up new prospects for the American working class." Elizabeth Gurley Flynn also spoke at the meeting. She said that she returned to work with a deeper belief in the victory of socialism and in socialist ideas.
