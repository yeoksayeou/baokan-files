The story of "America's Wonder Drug" was a widely circulated anecdote in the Kuomintang-controlled areas towards the end of the Liberation War, involving Luo Longji.

In the latter half of 1948, the "Third Force" route personally orchestrated by John Leighton Stuart faded into obscurity due to the people's strong resistance. However, the conspiracies of American imperialism did not cease. An organization, supported by the United States and fronted by Chinese individuals, resembling a "Maintenance Society," then began to operate more actively. They centered their activities in Shanghai, fabricating a grand scheme.

This organization was named "Shanghai All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association Action Committee." Its standing committee consisted of sixty-nine members, all renowned Kuomintang party hacks, youth league thugs, local despots, Jiang-Zhe financiers, bureaucratic capitalists, scum of the industrial and commercial sectors, American imperialist running dogs, academic tyrants, and gang leaders—truly a gathering of all the dregs. As the People's Liberation Army advanced on the Yangtze River, and the Nanjing "little court" was on the verge of collapse, these individuals banded together, relying on their American masters and following Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, attempting to "preserve Chiang's roots" and continue to antagonize the people.

These figures at the time attempted to first take over Shanghai from Chiang Kai-shek, hoping to infiltrate the people's government, preserve themselves, and engage in sabotage. Supported by their American masters, they sought to make a political deal, conducting a grand deception. It was a trick, but too blatant to succeed.

Another trick involved instructing certain local forces to change their banners, luring wavering elements within the democratic camp, and exploiting opportunities to drill loopholes, so as to sow seeds of pro-American, anti-communist sabotage in the new society in advance.

At the time, this kind of activity was also very active in Shanghai. Shanghai's "Iron News," associated with the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee and the Three People's Principles Youth League, once carried the following news:

"Former China Democratic League key figure Luo Longji, suffering from severe lung disease, was admitted to the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Lin Sen Middle Road last year for treatment. Party and state dignitaries such as Lei Zhen also visited him. Luo's two or three American friends frequently presented him with wonder drugs for lung disease… Luo has become much plumper than before, unlike his previous emaciated appearance. Luo recently talked about the current situation to visitors, always instructing them not to publish what was said… Luo seems to have no guards in the sanatorium, so his friends can visit and talk freely at any time."

Reviewing old history can increase people's vigilance. When many democratic人士 could not stay in the Chiang-controlled areas, Luo Longji not only stayed, but also could calmly stay in the hospital for treatment, talk freely about national affairs, and two or three American friends frequently gave him special drugs for lung disease. Kuomintang dignitaries such as Lei Zhen also visited him. Isn't it clear enough what kind of person Luo Longji is?

The Party and the people treat Luo Longji without dwelling on past misdeeds, always hoping that he will turn back and come to the people's side, and not return to the embrace of American imperialism. In June 1949, he finally came to Beijing. However, what he brought was the condition, instructed by John Leighton Stuart, to buy China with US dollars. Later, seeing that the people and the Party were not amenable to his purchase, he did not even bother to convey this meaning. It seems that he regretted this for the rest of his life because he failed to report back to the Americans.

Soon after Luo Longji came to the north, Xinhua News Agency's "Farewell, Leighton Stuart!" "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle!" and several editorials refuting the White Paper were published in succession, and the "democratic individualists" on whom American imperialism placed high hopes also superficially "disappeared." However, recently, under the pretext of helping the Party with rectification, the American wonder drug has played a role in reviving the dead.

I think the American wonder drug cannot cure the chronic illness of people like Luo Longji. It is better to take some Chinese wonder drugs, otherwise, it will become terminally ill and incurable.

    美国的特效药
    郭敏
    “美国的特效药”的故事，是在解放战争末期，流传在国民党统治区和罗隆基有关的一个掌故。
    1948年下半年由司徒雷登亲自策动的第三条路线，由于人民的坚强回击而消声敛迹。然而美帝国主义的阴谋并没有停止。一个由美国支持、由中国人出面的、类似“维持会”性质的机构，接着就更积极地行动起来。他们以上海为中心，加工制造一个大阴谋。
    这个会名字叫做“上海各界自救救国联合会行动委员会”。它的常委共有六十九人，都是些闻名的国民党的党棍、团棍、地方恶势力、江浙财阀、官僚资本家、工商界的败类、美帝走狗、学阀以及流氓头子，简直是集一切渣滓于一炉。这些人在人民解放军进逼长江，南京小朝廷说垮就垮的当儿，凑合起来，依靠美国主子，依照蒋介石的吩嘱，妄图“保蒋根”，继续与人民为敌。
    这些人物当时曾企图从蒋介石手里先把上海接收过来，希望能混入人民政府中去，从中保全自己，并从事破坏工作。在美国主子的支持下，他们想做一次政治买卖，进行一个大骗局。这是一个花招，但是由于太露骨了，未能实现。
    另外还有一个花招，这就是指使某些地方势力改换旗帜，在民主阵营中勾引某些动摇分子入彀，利用机会来钻空子，以便在新社会里预先播下一些亲美反共的破坏种子。
    当时，这种活动，在上海也是非常活跃。与国民党市党部和三青团有关的上海“铁报”，曾经载着这样一段消息：
    “前民盟要角罗隆基，因患肺病甚剧，去岁入林森中路虹桥疗养院治病，党国要人如雷震等亦前往探视。罗氏之二三美国友人，频频以肺病特效药相赠。……罗氏已较前白胖许多，不似往日之瘦骨嶙峋。罗氏近对往访者谈及时局，临行都以不要发表相嘱。……罗氏在疗养院中，似无监守者，故其友辈得随时前往纵谈。”
    温习一下旧的历史是会增加人们的警惕的。当很多民主人士都在蒋管区呆不下去的时候，罗隆基不但呆下去了，而且能从容住院疗养，畅谈国事，二三美国友人，还频频以肺病特效药相赠，国民党要员雷震等还前往探视。难道罗隆基是个什么样的人还不是够清楚了吗？
    党和人民对待罗隆基是不念旧恶的，总是希望他回头是岸，走向人民方面来，不要再走到美帝国主义的怀抱中去。他在1949年6月终于到北京来了。然而他带来的却是司徒雷登授意的以美金购买中国的条件。后来看到人民和党不受他的收买，所以他连这意思也未便转达了。看来这是他未能向美国人交代而抱恨终身的了。
    罗隆基北来不久，新华社的“别了，司徒雷登”“丢掉幻想，准备斗争！”和几篇驳白皮书的社论就连续发表了，美帝寄以厚望的“民主个人主义者”也表面上“消声敛迹”起来。然而，在最近借口帮助党整风的机会，美国的特效药又起了还魂作用了。
    我看美国的特效药是治不了罗隆基之流的沉疴的，还是服一些中国的特效药吧，否则是就会病入膏肓，不可救药的。
