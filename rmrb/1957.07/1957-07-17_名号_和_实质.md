    "Name" and "Substance"
    Hàn Yī
    Luo Longji has become notorious for his "mumbling and hesitation" this time, but looking at his instructions to Pu Xixiu, it shows that he is actually a very straightforward person. "Regardless of whether the person is changed or not, the Party group is always the Party group." No matter who is changed, as long as it is a Party group, it must be opposed. How clear is that?

    Right-wingers, like anyone else who opposes the Communist Party, are not against the "Communist Party" name, but against the substance of the Party. Didn't some right-wingers call for "Communist Party members to stand up" and "revolt" this time? They express a very warm welcome to Communist Party members who have "stood up" or "revolted," even though their name is still Communist Party member. If the entire Party were to deteriorate, they would be even more welcoming. There is no shortage of such examples in the world. Similarly, as long as the Communist Party does not change its essence, persists in taking the socialist road, and realizes communism, no matter what name it changes to, such as Workers' Party, Labor Party, People's Party, etc., they will still oppose it. There are countless examples of this as well.

    In fact, opposition to socialism is not opposition to its name, but opposition to its substance. Don't right-wingers say they are also engaged in socialism? However, what they want is socialism without the leadership of the Communist Party; such socialism neither touches the foundation of private ownership nor changes the superstructure of the rule of the few over the many. The British Labour Party gentlemen have been striving for this kind of "socialism" for a long time, and there are also people in the world who are enthusiastically building this kind of "socialist" country.

    Thus, what the right-wingers ultimately want to oppose is the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the proletariat and the elimination of private ownership. And what the people want to oppose is precisely these right-wingers.

    “名号”和“实质”
  　汗一
    罗隆基这次是“吞吞吐吐”出了名的，但是看看他对浦熙修的吩咐，说明他实在是个直截了当不过的人。“不管换人不换人，党组总是党组”，不管换了什么人来，只要是党组就要反对，这是何等的明白。
    右派分子，也和其他任何反对共产党的人一样，并不是反对“共产党”这个名号，而是反对这个党的实质。这次不是很有些右派分子号召“共产党员站出来”“起义”吗？对“站出来”了的或是“起义”了的共产党员，虽然名号还是共产党员，他们就表示十分欢迎。倘是整个党的变质，就更是万分欢迎。世界上也不乏这种实例的。同样，只要共产党不改变自己的实质，坚持走社会主义道路，实现共产主义，无论改成什么名字，例如工人党，劳动党，人民党等等，他们还是要反对的。这实例也是不胜枚举的。
    其实反对社会主义，也不是反对它的名号，而是反对它的实质。右派分子不是说他们也搞社会主义吗？不过他们要搞的是不要共产党领导的社会主义，这样的社会主义就是既不能动私有制的基础，也不改变少数人对多数人的统治的上层建筑。英国工党先生们已经为这种“社会主义”奋斗了很长时间了，现在世界上也有人正在热心地建设这种“社会主义”国家。
    这样，右派分子归根结蒂所要反对的，是无产阶级领导下的人民专政和消灭私有制。而人民所要反对的却正是这种右派分子。
