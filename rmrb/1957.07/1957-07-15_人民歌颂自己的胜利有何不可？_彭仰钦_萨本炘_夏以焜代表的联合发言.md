　　We wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou's government work report, and other reports of the conference, and we guarantee to resolutely implement the spirit of all the reports.

　　Over the past year, our country has made brilliant achievements in various construction undertakings. This is a well-known and obvious fact. When the people of the whole country, inspired by this great victory, are confidently striving to comprehensively overfulfill the first five-year plan and move towards the victory of the second five-year plan, a few right-wing elements have launched a frenzied attack and vicious slander against the socialist cause of our Party and our country. At first, we did not see their true colors clearly and regarded them as our own people, but later they became more and more blatant. Now we have completely seen through them. They are not our own people, nor are they our friends. Originally, they were a bunch of anti-communist and anti-people clowns. We have also completely seen clearly that they are not helping the Party to rectify its work style, nor are they "voicing opinions" and "letting go," but are challenging the socialist system of our country. This is an acute class struggle on the ideological front about who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism, revolution and counter-revolution. In this struggle, we, the liberated working people, have fresh memories of the past suffering. In order to defend the fruits of the revolution, we are determined to sharpen our eyes, continue to heighten our vigilance, and resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end. One of the sinister tactics and means of the right-wing elements is to use some vague and ambiguous remarks to incite the people, trying to muddy the waters and darken the clear sky, so that the people who are busy with socialist construction will lose their way. We say that our country has made great achievements in various aspects of construction, but they say that our construction is "a complete mess"; we say that achievements are the main thing, but they insist that "you are dogmatic" and that shortcomings are the main thing. Right-wing gentlemen! Evil spirits cannot do evil in broad daylight, and your attempts will always be in vain.

　　We are all practitioners engaged in the country's socialist industrialization construction. We want to compete with you in this aspect that you are attacking! Right-wing gentlemen! Open your eyes and look at the historical facts! Can you tell whether it is more than ten or more than one? In the short eight years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have saved on food and clothing, and used their wisdom and hands to overcome various difficulties, quickly restored the wounds of war, and started large-scale economic construction. At the beginning of liberation, didn't you also predict that the Communist Party could only fight wars but could not build? Saying "You should take over the blast furnaces and plant sorghum!" What about now! We have not only planted sorghum well, but also refined steel well. The annual output of steel has increased from 900,000 tons before liberation to 4.5 million tons now. Can you deny this figure! In the past eight years, the total industrial output value of our country has increased more than five times. This is also a fact, right! Are these badly done and the main thing is shortcomings? Let's take our Wuhan City as an example! In recent years, its face has completely changed. In the past, it was a consumer city that had been cruelly exploited by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. The only bit of industry it had was mostly incomplete, old, inefficient, few in variety, and small in scale. The city was full of smoggy commercial speculation. After liberation, the power returned to the people, and now it is gradually being transformed into one of the country's huge industrial bases. The Hanshui Railway Bridge and the Hanshui Highway Bridge have been completed and opened to traffic one after another; the world-famous Yangtze River Bridge was completed in May this year and will soon be officially opened to traffic. The ideal of turning a natural moat into a thoroughfare has been realized. The Yangtze River is no longer an obstacle to north-south transportation in the motherland. The rulers of old China also shouted and shouted about the construction of this great project, but the people knew that this was just their deceptive propaganda to try to maintain their rule. Facts have proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, in an era when the people are their own masters, is it possible to complete such a great and unprecedented construction project in a short period of three years. The first unit of the huge Qingshan Thermal Power Plant has begun operation, and the construction of the new meat joint processing plant, Wuhan Printing and Dyeing Factory, Heavy Machinery Plant, and Medium-sized Boiler Factory is also proceeding smoothly with the help of Soviet experts. Some workshops in some factories have already started production. What is particularly encouraging is that the large-scale Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, the country's second steel base, has fully started construction, and the first blast furnace, 73 meters high with an annual output of 750,000 tons of iron, will be completed and put into production next year.

　　On the banks of the Yangtze River in Wuhan, next to each huge construction site, you can always hear millions of people passing by and people resting after work. How happy they are to talk about the bridge, about these newly built factories, recalling the past and proudly looking forward to a bright future. Conscientious people! Are these called the main thing is shortcomings! Is it all a mess! Right-wing gentlemen said: You are rectifying your work style, making self-criticism, you should talk about shortcomings, why praise achievements? We say yes! Rectification is about talking about shortcomings, but talking about shortcomings can only be shortcomings and should not reverse black and white, saying good is bad, and saying bad is good. Saying that we are praising achievements, we say that this is just correcting the facts that you have distorted. Not to mention that we are not praising achievements, it is just that the people are cheering for their own great victory, singing their own praises, praising their own virtues, and reporting their own joys. What's wrong with this! How can this be called "nauseating" and "shameless"?

　　To put it bluntly, why can't we always agree! We say it is victory, you say it is failure; we say that the people have created miracles in the past few years, you insist on saying it is "overall rash advance," "fond of boasting and being eager for success," "a complete mess"; we say that we have eliminated counter-revolutionaries and the people have gained peace, you say that we have hurt "good people"; we say that socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat have unparalleled superiority, you say that it is the root cause of three evils. What is the reason! We shout loudly to the right-wing gentlemen: You are not standing with us, you have stood in the wrong direction, we are going east, you are going west, we are going to socialism, you are going to capitalism, no wonder we are facing the same facts and we have our own understanding and no common language.

　　The right-wing elements' slanderous attacks on us have not made us lose anything. Real gold is not afraid of fire. The hearts of 600 million people will always be towards the Communist Party. Our style of work will continue to be rectified, but the people will never allow the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies to succeed. Now the struggle against the right-wing is unfolding across the country. Where are the right-wing elements going? The road is very clear. You should quickly rein in your horses, turn around and make a thorough confession. The people will not hold you accountable for the past. If you are still obsessed, then you are cutting yourselves off from the people. You choose your own paths!

    人民歌颂自己的胜利有何不可？
    彭仰钦　萨本炘　夏以焜代表的联合发言
  　我们衷心拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告和周总理的政府工作报告，及大会的其他各项报告，并保证把各项报告的精神坚决贯彻执行。　
    一年来我们国家在各项建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就，这是人所共知、有目共睹的事实。全国人民在这伟大胜利的鼓舞下，正在满怀信心地为全面超额完成第一个五年计划并向着第二个五年计划胜利迈进的时候，少数右派分子却向我们党和我们国家的社会主义事业，进行了猖狂的进攻和恶毒的诬蔑。开始我们对我们的真面目看得不清楚，还把他们当作自己人，但是以后越来越露骨了。现在我们彻底看穿了，他们不是我们自己人，也不是我们的朋友，原来他们是一伙反共反人民的小丑。我们也完全看清了，他们不是在帮助党整风，也不是什么“鸣”和“放”，而是在向我们国家的社会主义制度挑战。这是一场社会主义和资本主义、革命和反革命在思想战线上谁战胜谁的一场尖锐的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，解放了的劳动人民我们对过去的痛苦记忆犹新，为了保卫革命的成果，我们决心擦亮自己的眼睛，继续提高警惕，与右派分子坚决斗争到底。右派分子阴险的战术和手段之一就是用一些若明若暗似是而非的言论煽惑人民群众，企图把清水搅混，把晴天遮暗，使之正在忙于社会主义建设的人们迷失方向。我们说我们国家各方面的建设是取得了巨大的成就，他们说我们的建设是“一团糟”；我们说成绩是主要的，他们硬说“你这是教条”而缺点是主要的。右派先生们！光天化日之下邪气是不能作妖的，你们的企图将永远是徒劳的。
    我们几个都是实际从事国家社会主义工业化的建设者，我们要在你们攻打的这个方面上和你们较量较量！右派先生们！你们睁眼看看历史事实吧！究竟是十个多还是一个多，你们该能够分辨出来吧！解放后短短的八年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，节衣缩食，用自己的智慧和双手克服了种种困难，很快的恢复了战争创伤，开始了大规模的经济建设。解放之初，你们不是也曾预言共产党只能打仗不能建设吗！说“你们接收高炉去种高粱吧”！现在怎么样呢！我们不仅种好了高粱，也炼好了钢。钢的年产量由解放前的九十万吨提高到现在的四百五十万吨。这个数字你们能够否认吗！八年来我国工业的总产值增加了五倍以上，这也是事实吧！难道这些就是糟得很、缺点是主要的吗！再以我们武汉市来说吧！这几年来它的面貌已经完全改观了。过去它是一个长期受着帝国主义和国民党反动派残酷剥削的消费城市，仅有的一点点工业在设备上也大部是残缺陈旧、功效不高、种类不多、规模很小的，城市里充满着乌烟瘴气的商业投机，解放后政权回到了人民手里，现在正逐步改变成我们国家巨大的工业基地之一。汉水铁桥、汉水公路桥已先后建成通车；世界闻名的长江大桥，已于今年五月合龙，不久即可正式通车，天堑变通途人民的理想实现了，长江不再是祖国南北交通运输上的障碍了。这个伟大工程的建设，旧中国的统治者们！也曾大喊而特喊过，但是人民懂得这只不过是他们企图维护自己的统治所进行的欺骗宣传罢了。事实证明只有在共产党的领导下，在人民自己当家作主的时代才有可能在短短的三年的时间里完成这样伟大的史无前例的建设工程。巨大的青山热电站第一台机组已经开始运转，新型肉类联合加工厂、武汉印染厂、重型机床厂和中型锅炉厂的建设也都正在苏联专家的帮助下顺利进行，其中有些厂的部分车间已经开始投入生产。特别振奋人心的是规模宏大的我国第二个钢铁基地——武汉钢铁联合企业已经全面开始动工，并且在明年度七十三公尺高年产七十五万吨铁的第一座高炉就将建成投入生产。
    在武汉长江两岸的大桥边，在一个个巨大的工地旁，你可以随时听到千百万个路过这里的人和工余休息的人们，他们是多么高兴的在谈论着大桥、谈论着这些新建的一批批的工厂，回忆着过去，骄傲的憧憬着美好的未来。有良心的人们！难道这些就叫缺点是主要的吗！都是一团糟吗！右派先生们说：你们整风嘛，作自我批评，就应该谈缺点，何必歌功颂德呢！我们说对！整风是要谈缺点的，但是谈缺点它只能是缺点而不应该颠倒黑白，把好的说成坏的，把坏的说成好的呀。说什么我们歌功颂德，我们说这不过是把你们歪曲了的事实纠正过来而已，莫说我们没有歌功颂德，就是人民为自己伟大的胜利而欢呼，歌自己的功，颂自己的德，报自己的喜，这又有什么不可以呢！这怎么又能说成是“肉麻”和“无耻”呢？
    把话说穿，为什么我们总是说不到一起呢！我们说是胜利，你们说是失败；我们说这几年人民创造了奇迹，你们偏要说是“全面冒进”、“好大喜功”、“一团糟”；我们说肃清了反革命，人民得到了安宁，你们说伤害了“好人”；我们说社会主义和无产阶级专政有无比的优越性，你们说它是三害的根源。原因何在呢！我们向右派先生们猛叫一声：你们并没有和我们站在一起，你们站错了方向，我们向东，你们向西，我们是向社会主义，你们是向资本主义，无怪乎我们面对着同一个事实而我们各有各的认识而没有共同的语言。
    右派分子对我们的诬蔑攻击，并没有使我们失掉了什么，真金不怕火炼，六万万人民的心永远向着共产党，我们的风要继续整，但反党反社会主义的阴谋，人民也决不叫他得逞。现在反右派的斗争，已经在全国展开，右派分子们何去何从，道路很清楚，还是赶快悬崖勒马，回转头来彻底交代，人民是不究既往的，如仍执迷不悟，那是你们自绝于人民，两条道路你们自己去选择吧！
