Xinhua News Agency, 26th Dispatch: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and have made remarkable achievements in practicing thrift and supporting the socialist construction of the motherland.

Without affecting the execution of tasks, various units have greatly reduced expenditure. According to incomplete statistics, in the four years from 1953 to 1956, a total of more than 1.4 billion yuan in expenditure was saved for the country through reducing budgets and clearing inventory materials. This year, according to the actual needs and possibilities of the troops, many economical measures have been taken in terms of clothing, food, coal, and fodder. As a result of implementation, 150 million yuan can be saved in one year. In addition, various units have vigorously promoted the experience of modifying stoves, saving a large amount of coal for cooking.

In recent years, the broad masses of officers and soldiers have also created a large amount of wealth for the country with their own hands. Various organs and units have carried out production activities such as growing vegetables and raising pigs in their spare time, which has played a great role in improving the life of the troops and solving the difficulties in market supply. It is estimated by relevant departments that the sideline production of various units this year can produce 200 million catties of vegetables and 10 million catties of pork for the whole army throughout the year.

In military training, officers and soldiers of many units have made a large number of training equipment by themselves. The broad masses of officers and soldiers also cherish the weapons in their hands very much.

The transportation units have also achieved great results in saving. Due to the strengthening of fuel storage and the constant search for ways to save fuel, the figures for various types of fuel saved by the entire army last year were astonishing. The fuel consumption of many units was reduced by about 25% compared to the standard.

The officers and soldiers embraced the agricultural cooperation movement with great enthusiasm. Many officers and soldiers donated the money they had saved over the years. As of June this year, the donations from the entire army to support agricultural production cooperatives had reached more than 24.4 million yuan. In addition, various units also voluntarily donated and purchased farm tools, livestock, medicines, fertilizers, etc., and donated them to the agricultural cooperatives stationed in the area.

    发扬光荣传统　支援祖国建设
    解放军几年来厉行节约成绩巨大
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵继承和发扬了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，在厉行节约，支援祖国社会主义建设方面做出了显著成绩。
    各部队在不影响执行任务的情况下，大大缩减了经费开支。据不完全统计，从1953年到1956年四年当中，在削减预算、清理库存物资等方面共为国家节约了十四亿多元的开支。今年，根据部队的实际需要与可能，在服装、粮食、煤炭、马料等方面又采取了许多节约措施。实行的结果，一年就可以节约一亿五千万元。此外，各部队还大力推广了修改炉灶的经验，节约了大量炊事用煤。
    几年来，广大官兵还用自己的双手，为国家创造了大量的财富。各机关、部队利用业余时间开展种菜、养猪等生产活动，对改善部队生活、解决市场供应困难都起到很大作用。今年各部队的副业生产，据有关部门估计，全军全年可生产蔬菜两亿斤，猪肉一千万斤。
    各部队在军事训练中，不少单位的官兵自己动手制作了大量的训练器材。广大官兵还十分珍爱自己手中的武器。
    各运输部队节约成绩也很大。由于加强了油料保管和不断找寻节省油料的窍门，去年全军节约各种油料的数字大得惊人。不少单位的耗油量比标准降低了25％左右。
    在支援农业合作化运动中官兵们抱着很大的热情。不少军官和士兵捐献了自己长年累月积省下来的钱。截至今年6月份，全军支援农业生产合作社的捐款已达二千四百多万元。此外，各部队还自动捐献购买了农具、牲口、药品、肥料等分别赠送给驻地农业社。
