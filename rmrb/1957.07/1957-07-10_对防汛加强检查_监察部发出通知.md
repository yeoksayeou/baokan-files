Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Ministry of Supervision today issued a notice to the Supervision Bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, requesting them to strengthen the inspection of flood control work.

The notice said: In order to overcome floods and protect agricultural production and the safety of the people, the supervisory organs in all areas along the rivers, along the coast, and near lakes should immediately and proactively cooperate with the flood control command organizations and civil affairs departments at all levels to conduct inspections of flood control and disaster relief work. Before the flood arrives, the main focus should be on inspecting the organization of flood control forces, the establishment of institutions, and the preparation of flood control materials, as well as the progress of reinforcing dangerous projects. After the flood occurs, efforts should be concentrated on inspecting the work of rescue, plugging breaches, and providing relief and resettlement to disaster victims. In areas affected by waterlogging, efforts should be promptly made to inspect the work of drainage and restoring farmland production. Through inspection, this work should be supervised and improved. Timely inspection and handling should be carried out for derelict cadres and organs that have caused serious losses due to negligence and inadequate rescue efforts.
