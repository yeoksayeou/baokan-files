Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Peking University "Democracy Wall," which has played a significant role in promoting the anti-Rightist struggle at Peking University, has become even more active recently. On the "Democracy Wall," students are using various forms to expose the ugly faces of the Rightists. There are special columns dedicated to exposing Rightists such as Long Yinghua, Yang Lu, and Liu Qidi, detailing their anti-Party leadership and anti-socialist speeches and actions. There are also excellent short poems, essays, and cartoons depicting the Rightists' discomfiture after being criticized by the students. There are even chapter novels, describing chapter by chapter the Rightists' origins, experiences, and activities. On the "Democracy Wall," some students write about the changes in their ideological understanding or express their determination to fight the Rightists in big-character posters, but more of it is focused on exposing and criticizing the Rightists. At the highest point of the "Democracy Wall," students used whitewash to write a huge slogan on the wall: "All speeches and actions that deviate from socialism are completely wrong."

On the two big-character posters recently posted by the Rightist Tan Tianrong in the last few days, many students have used pens to write many sharply critical words next to every line he wrote. In his big-character poster, Tan Tianrong copied a line from a poem by Shelley: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Students wrote next to these two sentences: "If you always isolate yourself from the people, your spring will never come." Around these big-character posters were other posters such as "Criticize Tan Tianrong" and "Strip off Tan Tianrong's outer garment again," saying that Tan Tianrong is "most foolish to play tricks in front of the truth."

Now, the Rightists rarely post big-character posters. Sometimes they post one or two, but they can no longer find supporters and are instead met with many rebuttals. For example, one Rightist posted a big-character poster declaring himself to be a "true leftist." Soon after the poster was put up, it was surrounded by dissenting opinions. An anonymous author wrote a poem telling the Rightist Liu Qidi "not to resent or grieve." After many students read it, they wrote on it: "This is a poisonous poem," and demanded that the author write his name to argue.

### 打退右派进攻，齐力铲除毒草  北大“民主墙”更显活跃

    打退右派进攻，齐力铲除毒草
    北大“民主墙”更显活跃
    新华社21日讯　在北京大学反右派斗争中起着很大推动作用的北大
  “民主墙”近来更加活跃了，在“民主墙”上，学生们通过多种多样的形式，揭发右派分子的丑恶面目。这里有专门为揭露龙英华、杨路、刘奇弟等右派分子而辟的专栏，上面详细地叙述了这些右派分子的反对党的领导、反对社会主义的言论和行动。也有很精彩的短诗、杂文和漫画，刻划出右派分子被学生们批驳后的狼狈相。这里还有章回小说，逐章描写右派分子的出身、经历和活动。在“民主墙”上，也有学生们写自己思想认识的转变过程或表示对右派分子斗争决心的大字报，但更多的是对右派分子的揭露和批驳。在“民主墙”的最高处，学生们用石灰水在墙上写着巨大的标语：“一切离开社会主义的言论和行动，是完全错误的。”
    在右派分子谭天荣最近几天新贴的两张大字报上，已经有许多学生在他写的每一行字的旁边，用钢笔写了许多针锋相对地批驳谭天荣的文字。谭天荣在大字报上抄录了雪莱的一首诗句：“冬天如果来了，春天还会远吗？”学生们就在这两句话的旁边写着：“如果你一直自绝于人民，你的春天是永远不会来的。”围绕这些大字报的旁边，正贴着“批判谭天荣”、“再剥谭天荣的外衣”等大字报，说谭天荣在“真理面前耍策略，是最愚蠢的”。
    现在，右派分子贴出的大字报已经很少了。有时他们也贴出一、两张大字报，但是再也找不到支持者，而是遭到许多人的驳斥。例如有一个右派分子贴出的一张大字报，声言自己是“真正的左派”。大字报贴出后不久，周围就贴满了反驳的意见。有一个不具名的作者写了一首诗，这首诗要右派分子刘奇弟“不要怨恨，也不要悲伤。”许多学生看了以后，就在上面写着：“这是一首有毒的诗”，要求作者写出名字来争辩。
