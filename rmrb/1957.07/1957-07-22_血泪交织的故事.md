    A Story Interwoven with Blood and Tears
    Hu Huiling

    Following "The Wolf," the Japanese progressive film "Epitome" is also being shown. Soon, another Japanese art film, "Out of Darkness," will also meet with Chinese audiences.

    Indignation, boundless indignation, is the common emotion of every Chinese audience member when watching "The Wolf," "Epitome," "Out of Darkness," and other stories interwoven with blood and tears. At the same time, those who have come from the old society will naturally recall many bitter and bleak past events. Because the specific things depicted in these films, Chinese audiences may not have seen some of them (such as the activities of life insurance company sales personnel in "The Wolf," the geisha life in "Epitome," etc.). However, the essential darkness of capitalism that they expose, and the inhuman suffering of people trying to make a living in this dark society, are things that we can understand.

    The "wolf pack," as headlined in large characters in Japanese newspapers, are five kind-hearted men and women who have been forced by life to take the path of robbery. They have to sacrifice their own lives to provide temporary food and clothing for themselves and their families. The film "The Wolf" sharply points out with unspoken anger that they are victims devoured by that wolf-like cannibalistic social system. "Epitome" unveils the curtain on the painful lives of the Japanese people through the geisha, a seemingly not-so-terrible profession, which permeates Japanese social life. The heartbreaking and trembling voice of the geisha Ginza: "Sister, it's good that you died, you were lucky to have died before becoming a geisha! ... Anyway, we have no happiness in living," still resounds in my ears. Ginza's father, the old shoemaker, bowing his head and bending his back, venting his resentment and forcibly suppressing his tears with the action of fiercely pulling the thread, and the almost numb and helpless expression of his mother, also constantly float before my eyes. Poverty, humiliation, and resentment are the most general contents of the current life of the Japanese people. Otowa Nobuko, who plays Ginza, uses an image that is completely different from the one she created when she played Yano Akiko in "The Wolf," to show us the tragic fate of Japanese women. "Out of Darkness" focuses on exposing the truth of capitalist false democracy, which is splattered with the blood of innocent people, from a judicial perspective. In Japanese courts, as in the courts of other capitalist countries, there are legal seats for lawyers to defend the accused. However, when the facts are very clear, and the innocent defendants are waiting for release, and their families are also happily coming to pick them up, the court still announces that they are sentenced to death and imprisonment, simply because the court wants to maintain its own credibility (in the past, the police station wrongly judged the case due to subjective conjecture). Most of the families of the criminals are poor, and they are on the verge of bankruptcy in order to save the lives of their loved ones, but in the end it is all in vain. The honest lawyer is also helpless. The last shot of the film is a close-up of the young man sentenced to death lunging at the iron bars and shouting heart-wrenchingly to his sobbing old mother outside the bars: "Mom, there's still the Supreme Court!" This hopeful, but actually desperate, cry pierces the heart, implying to people: "The Supreme Court is the same!" As for the secret torture in the police station, it is even more unbearable to witness.

    The reason why "The Wolf," "Epitome," "Out of Darkness," and other progressive Japanese films are so deeply rooted in people's hearts is that they incisively and vividly reflect the true face of this society. Therefore, although they depict the current situation in Japan, they can also make us think of China's past and feel that this is also a portrayal of old China. At the same time, its simple expression method also increases the power of feeling.

    After watching these films and coming out of the cinema, looking at our current society again, it is truly like a world apart. What reason do we have not to love our Party? It is precisely it that led us to destroy the evil rule that still weighs on the heads of the people in Japan and other capitalist and colonial countries, and established a free and prosperous new country!

    血泪交织的故事
    胡惠玲
    继“狼”之后，日本进步电影“缩影”又上映了。不久，另一部日本艺术片“暗无天日”也将与我国观众见面。
    激愤，无比的激愤，这是每一个中国观众在看“狼”、“缩影”、“暗无天日”等血泪交织的故事时的共同情感。同时，从旧社会走过来的人，也都会自然而然地想起许多辛辣惨淡的往事。因为这些影片所描写的具体事情，中国观众可能有些是没见过的（如“狼”中人寿保险公司的外勤人员的活动，“缩影”中的艺妓生涯等等）。但它们所揭露出的资本主义的本质的黑暗，以及在这黑暗的社会中讨生活的人的非人痛苦，却是我们能够理解的。
    日本报纸上用大字标题标出的“狼群”，是被生活所逼、走上抢劫道路的五个善良男女。他们为了自己同家人的暂时的温饱，不得不偿付出自己的生命。影片“狼”以无言的愤懑，尖锐地指出他们正是被那狼样吃人的社会制度所吞噬的牺牲者。“缩影”则通过充塞于日本社会生活中的艺妓，这个看来并不太可怕的行业，揭开了日本人民痛苦生活的帷幕。艺妓银子悲痛颤栗的声音：“妹妹，你死了也好，你幸亏在没当艺妓之前就死了！……反正我们活着也没有幸福”，直到现在，还震响在我耳边。银子的父亲，老鞋匠低头曲背，用猛抽针线的动作，来发泄怨恨，强忍眼泪的侧影，和母亲近似麻木了的无可奈何的神态，也一直浮在我眼前。贫困，忍辱含愤，这就是日本人民当前生活的最一般的内容。扮演银子的乙羽信子，用与在“狼”中扮演矢野秋子时所创造出的迥然不同的形象，向我们展示出了日本妇女的悲惨命运。“暗无天日”则着重从司法的角度，来暴露溅满着无辜者鲜血的资本主义假民主的真象。在日本法庭上，也如其他资本主义国家法庭上一样，有着合法的代被告辩护的律师的席位。可是，当事实已非常明白，毫无罪过的被告们等待着释放，他们的家属也满心欢喜地来接他们时，法庭却仍旧宣布他们被判死刑和徒刑，原因不过是法院为了维持自己的信誉（过去由于警察署的主观臆断判错了）罢了。犯人的家庭大多是贫困的，为了抢救亲人的性命，已濒于破产，但到头来仍是一场空。正直的律师也毫无办法。影片最后是被判死刑的青年扑向铁栏、向栏外饮泣的老母呕心泣血呼喊的特写镜头：“妈妈，还有最高法院哪！”这希望的、其实是绝望的呼声，震透人心，它暗示人们：“最高法院也是这样啊！”至于警察署里秘密的非刑拷打，更是惨不忍睹。
    “狼”、“缩影”、“暗无天日”以及其他进步的日本影片所以深入人心，就在于它一针见血而且形象地反映了这个社会的真实面貌。所以，虽然他表现的是日本的现状，却能使我们同样想起中国的过去，感到这也是旧中国的写照。同时，它的朴素的表现方法，也增加了感人的力量。
    看了这些影片，从影院出来，再瞧一瞧我们现今的社会，那真是犹如隔世。我们有什么理由不爱我们的党呢？正是它领导我们摧毁了那至今仍压在日本及其他资本主义、殖民地人民头上的罪恶统治，建立了自由富强的新国家啊！
