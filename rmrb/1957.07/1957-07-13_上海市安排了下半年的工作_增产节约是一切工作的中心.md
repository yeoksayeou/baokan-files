Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon attended by over 10,000 people. Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu delivered a mobilization speech at the meeting on further developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and pointed out that the campaign to increase production and practice economy is the center of all work in the second half of the year.

In his report, Cao Diqiu said that Shanghai's industrial sector achieved remarkable results in the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the first half of this year. The city's total industrial output value plan was completed by 104.6%, accounting for 51% of the annual industrial output value plan; the profits and taxes submitted to the state in the first half of this year also completed 53% of the annual plan.

In analyzing the conditions for further developing the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the second half of the year, Cao Diqiu pointed out that the supply of raw materials will basically be able to meet the needs of production in the second half of the year, and the market will also enter a peak season. Therefore, the industrial sector must continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy to ensure the completion of this year's production plan.

In response to the shortcomings in the movement during the first half of the year, Cao Diqiu requested the cadres of all departments present to strengthen their leadership over the movement in the future, establish and improve necessary management systems, and take measures to ensure and improve product quality.
