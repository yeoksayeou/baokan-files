    Railway Connecting Henan and Shanxi

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd - Preparations are underway for the construction of the Zhan (Dian) - Dong (Guan) Railway, which will connect Henan and Shanxi provinces. The preliminary design for this railway was completed in June of last year, and the technical design work for the Jiaozuo to Jincheng section, which is about to begin construction, is being accelerated. More than 800 employees from the Second Engineering Office of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is undertaking the construction of this section, have rushed to the site. It is expected that large-scale construction of this section will begin around the first quarter of next year.

    The Zhan-Dong Railway is 362 kilometers long. It starts from the Zhandian Station on the north bank of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, passes through Jiaozuo, Jincheng and other places, and connects with the Dongguan Station in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. This railway crosses the steep Taihang Mountains, and the train will travel up and down more than 40 kilometers in the deep mountains and valleys. The so-called "Yu Gong Moves the Mountain" refers to this place.

    沟通河南、山西的铁路
    据新华社郑州22日电　沟通河南、山西两省的詹（店）东（观）铁路，正在进行施工前的准备工作。这条铁路的初步设计已在去年6月完成，即将动工的焦作到晋城段线路的技术设计工作，正在加紧进行。承建这段线路的铁道部第四工程局第二工程处，已有八百多名职工奔赴现场。预计明年第一季度前后，这段线路便要大量施工。
    詹东铁路全长三百六十二公里。它从京汉铁路黄河北岸的詹店车站起，经过焦作、晋城等地和同蒲铁路南段的东观车站相衔接。这条铁路横跨山陡山急的太行山脉，火车在深山险谷中要上上下下行走四十多公里。所谓“愚公移山”便是指这里说的。
