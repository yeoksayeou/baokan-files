Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) has begun conducting a rectification campaign within its internal organs.

This morning, the CDNCA Central Standing Committee convened a staff meeting, where Hu Zi'ang, Vice Chairman of the CDNCA, delivered a mobilization report for the rectification. Subsequently, seven staff members spoke, exposing Zhang Naiqi's consistent reactionary words and deeds, as well as his activities in cultivating a personal following within the CDNCA and vying for leadership.

In his report, Hu Zi'ang systematically introduced the criticisms of Zhang Naiqi by the China Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Sichuan delegation to the National People's Congress.

Hu Zi'ang also pointed out that Zhang Naiqi's activities in vying for leadership within the CDNCA have been consistent. He said that since joining the Democratic National Construction Association in 1949, he had frequently witnessed disputes between Zhang Naiqi and Shi Fuliang. Shi Fuliang had once said that Zhang Naiqi was full of poison and bourgeois ideas and wanted to usurp the leadership of the Democratic National Construction Association, and pointed out that if Zhang Naiqi were to seize the leadership of the CDNCA, the political direction of the CDNCA would shift towards the bourgeoisie. After Shi Fuliang fell ill, Zhang Naiqi turned to dispute with Huang Yanpei, then fought against the Second Plenary Session of the CDNCA, and now has further developed into a conflict with the working class and the people of the whole country.

Yan Baozhang and six others, in their speeches, exposed many facts about Zhang Naiqi's attempt to use the Democratic National Construction Association as his territory for conducting anti-socialist activities.

Yan Baozhang said that in 1950, the CDNCA headquarters organized a cadre study session, and the participants were carefully selected by local CDNCA organizations. However, Zhang Naiqi insisted on introducing Chen Xianchi and Ding Guozhen, counter-revolutionaries who had sneaked into the mainland from Hong Kong, to participate in the study. After the study session, one was placed to work in the CDNCA's Propaganda and Education Department, and the other was introduced to the Private Enterprise Administration Bureau. A few years ago, he also wrote a letter to Xiang De, introducing a "businessman" to borrow money from the People's Bank of Changsha City, asking Xiang De to act as a guarantor. It was later discovered that this person was a counter-revolutionary. On the one hand, Zhang Naiqi cultivated a personal following, and on the other hand, he scolded Communist Party members as "Party overlords," who "see themselves as superior to others," in order to reduce the prestige of Party members among the masses.

Tan Zhiqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Democratic National Construction Association, revealed that Zhang Naiqi had also said an absurd thing: Capitalists who hand over the means of production have the qualities of selfless Communist Party members.

Ji Borui, Wang Fengnian, Li Zhenfen, Zhou Tongshan, Bao Shuchuan, and other staff members of the CDNCA Central Standing Committee, revealed that Zhang Naiqi excluded dissidents and suppressed progressives within the CDNCA Central Standing Committee, colluding with his wife, Yang Meizhen, who worked in the CDNCA headquarters, pointing out that Zhang Naiqi hated progress and was deeply resentful of those who supported socialism. Bao Shuchuan also pointed out that whenever Zhang Naiqi talked about Communist Party members, he would cite Liu Qingshan, Zhang Zishan, and Li Wanming as examples.

Those who spoke today all pointed out that there are some right-wing elements within the CDNCA Central Standing Committee who are being used by Zhang Naiqi, and they demanded that they bravely examine themselves and fight against Zhang Naiqi.

    民建中常会召开整风大会揭露
    章乃器在民建培植私人争夺领导权
    据新华社6日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会开始在机关内部进行整风。
    今天上午，民建中常会召开了工作人员大会，由民建副主任委员胡子昂作整风动员报告，接着有七个工作人员发言揭露章乃器一贯的反动言行以及在民建内部培植私人、争夺领导权的活动。
    胡子昂在报告中，系统地介绍了中国民主建国会和全国工商联以及全国人民代表大会四川代表小组批判章乃器的情况。
    胡子昂还指出章乃器争夺民建领导权的活动是一贯的。他说他自从1949年参加民主建国会以后，经常看到章乃器同施复亮发生争执，施复亮曾经说过章乃器满身是毒，满脑子是资产阶级思想，想篡夺民主建国会的领导权，并且指出如果章乃器掌握民建的领导大权，民建的政治方向就会转向资产阶级方向。在施复亮生病以后，章乃器又转而同黄炎培争执，继而又同民建二中全会斗争，现在更发展为同工人阶级和全国人民之争。
    鄢宝璋等七人在发言中，就章乃器企图利用民主建国会作他的地盘进行反社会主义活动，揭发出许多事实。
    鄢宝璋说，1950年民建总会举办干部学习会，参加学习的人都是由各地民建组织慎重选派的，但是章乃器一定要介绍从香港潜入内地的反革命分子陈咸池、丁国桢参加学习，在学习结束后，一个被安插在民建宣教处工作，一个被介绍到私营企业管理局工作。前几年他还写信给向德，介绍一个“商人”到长沙市的人民银行借款，要向德作担保，事后发现这个人是个反革命分子。章乃器一方面培植私人，一方面谩骂共产党员是“党老爷”、“见人高一等”，以此降低党员在群众中的威信。
    民主建国会副秘书长谭志清揭发章乃器还说过一句荒谬透顶的话：交出生产资料的资本家，就是大公无私的共产党员的品质。
    民建中常会工作人员季柏瑞、王丰年、李振芬、周同善、包述传等人，揭露章乃器在民建中常会内排除异己，打击进步，同他的老婆、在民建总会任职的杨美真上下呼应，指出章乃器仇视进步，对拥护社会主义的人恨之入骨。包述传还指出章乃器一谈到共产党员就举出刘青山、张子善、李万铭等人为例子。
    今天发言的人，都指出民建中常会内有一些为章乃器所利用的右派分子，并且要求他们勇敢检查自己，并向章乃器作斗争。
