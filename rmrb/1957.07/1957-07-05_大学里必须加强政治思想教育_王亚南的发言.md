    I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and all other reports of the conference.
    Now, please allow me to talk about the issue of political and ideological education in universities. For the sake of clarity, I will divide my speech into the following points:
      Problems I Kept Thinking About on the Trip from Xiamen to Beijing
    I work in administration at Xiamen University. When I was about to leave for Beijing to attend this conference, a teacher in charge of the political course informed me that some students were planning to oppose the political course examination. Their reasons were: the political course should originally be changed to an elective course on a voluntary basis, there are many problems with the political course at present, and the examination would not be of much significance. The wording was quite strong, and they demanded to broadcast their appeal to everyone to oppose the examination through the radio station. Because I was leaving in a hurry, I temporarily put forward these few points, asking him to persuade the students and submit them to the school Party committee for consideration and handling:
    1. Our country's socialist construction is carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Party takes Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology to carry out leadership. If we want socialist construction and the leadership of the Communist Party, we must study Marxism-Leninism. University students are trained to serve as national construction cadres. If they do not study Marxism-Leninism, they will not understand why we must build socialism, why we can only build socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party; nor will they understand that they are entrusted by the people to study for the purpose of serving the people. The political course in universities is an important tool for us to carry out Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education. If university students want to have a direction and motivation in their current studies and future work, they must regard the political course as a course that must be studied.
    2. There are undoubtedly many problems in the current political courses: the teaching content, teaching quality, and teaching categories are all worth discussing. The Party Central Committee and the relevant leading departments of higher education are considering gradually resolving and improving them. However, all the problems that occur in political courses also occur to varying degrees in basic courses and even professional courses, which should not be the basis for our young students to adopt a negative attitude towards studying political courses.
    3. Of course, students who think that studying political courses is not of much significance, and therefore demand not to be examined in the political courses they are currently studying, may not be many, but even if there are many students, or even most students, who are influenced by their propaganda and instigation, we must adhere to the principle that the examination must be taken. This concerns national decrees and school discipline, and we cannot make concessions without principle.
    After I put forward these opinions and left the school, I kept thinking about this issue along the way. In the atmosphere of great blooming and great contending across the country, I am not too worried that the school will cause any trouble because of this issue, but what I am worried about is that even if the students are reluctantly persuaded to take the exam, the problem that some of them do not pay attention to political courses and political and ideological education has not been properly resolved. Why? Because:
      Students' Disregard for Political Courses is Not Accidental
    After liberation, especially in the first four or five years after liberation, university students in general were very serious about political courses and Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education. Everyone regarded it as a very dishonorable thing to fail the political course examination. The vast majority of people were willing to actively participate in social and political movements such as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the land reform, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns. Therefore, their socialist consciousness and political qualities in obeying the needs of the country and undertaking difficult work were greatly improved. However, in the past year or so, although a large proportion of students in the school still maintain a tendency to pay considerable attention to political courses and social political activities, there are various signs that their ideological dynamics have found it difficult to maintain due to the increasing spiritual pressure inside and outside the school.
    We know that the infectiousness and plasticity of young students are quite large. When the school and the outside are full of the atmosphere of political change; when the teachers in the school, especially those who have prestige among them, are also seriously studying politics and actively participating in political and educational reform activities, and some people are also studying Marxist-Leninist theory through the night university system, it obviously has a decisive influence on university students' attention to political and ideological education. But when the situation is not like this, the opposite effect will soon follow. The year 1956 was originally a year of great social change in China. The Party Central Committee foresaw that after the smooth completion of that social transformation, it would immediately put forward the requirement to accelerate the improvement of science and technology, so it made various efforts to further implement the policy on intellectuals, and put forward the call to the national cultural, educational, scientific and technological circles to march towards science, and in order to enhance the positive effect of this measure, it also widely promoted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in art and science. All these efforts were originally intended to weaken political and ideological education in the slightest, but perhaps because of this, everyone's attention was more directed towards business or scientific research, so that among teachers, and even among general young teachers, they quickly considered politics and business to be opposed to each other, thinking that studying politics has become a stumbling block to specializing in business; Marxist-Leninist night universities are becoming more and more like everyone's ideological burden, Marxism-Leninism also seems to have nothing to learn, and there is almost no one who wants to engage in work related to trade union activities; teachers who concurrently hold administrative positions are finding various excuses to back down; some people are also asking in many ways to teach less or not to teach, so that they have more time to study something amazing; teachers of political courses and cadres engaged in Party and League work also seem to have lost their energy. This situation, this environment, is already unfavorable for students to study political courses. At the right time, the Ministry of Higher Education, based on the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, suggested that while we learn from the advanced science and advanced teaching system of the Soviet Union, we may also appropriately absorb the beneficial experience of capitalist countries, and emphasized changing the students' rigid life. Therefore, according to the logical development connection or chain reaction within things, the tendency of individual liberalism that ignores discipline and organization is quickly felt that the teaching plan is a constraint on both teachers and students; the enthusiasm for learning Russian is not so high; for some people, the science and education systems of Britain and the United States are of course more to their taste; in their minds, Marxism-Leninism is no longer a guiding ideology, but has been reduced to just "one of the schools" in the contention of a hundred schools, and further reduced to purely outdated "dogma". Doesn't all this just show that some students have a dislike for political courses and oppose political course examinations, which is nothing more than a link in the chain reaction of a series of deviations currently existing in universities. Those problems (whether it is to regard politics and business as opposed to each other, to regard learning from the Soviet Union and learning from Britain and the United States as the same, or to regard the Marxist-Leninist theory related to the fate of human history and the theory of a certain faction of the bourgeoisie as no different) may be fundamental to some people, but for most people, it is nothing more than temporary lack of understanding and the result of blind obedience. But no matter from which aspect, strengthening political and ideological education in universities and strengthening the ideological transformation of intellectuals are proven to be imminent, although we still need to further explain the reasons.
    Further Analysis of the Necessity of Intellectual Transformation in Universities
    Yes, there are now individual senior intellectuals who openly oppose ideological transformation and have aroused some resonance among some people in the forum. In fact, if you think about it carefully, those of us who are over fifty years old have unconsciously, or self-adaptively, transformed our thinking several times. Until the 1920s, we were probably full of feudal ideas; in the 1930s and 1940s, the bourgeois ideology prevailed, and at the same time, some people were instilled with some socialist ideas that were somewhat dangerous at the time; when it came to the 1950s, the dangerous ideas were no longer dangerous, and everyone even consciously felt that it would be okay or necessary to absorb a little more, so even those who verbally strongly oppose ideological transformation, or who are determined to maintain the reputation of "purity" and the style of "hard bones," really cannot stop their own tendency of "daily renewal and continuous renewal." Because people have thoughts, they cannot but have ideological raw materials or environment. When the ideological raw materials change and the environment changes, they cannot but think about some new things. In the past, people were very poor, social customs were very bad, bandits were everywhere, few people were educated, no attention was paid to hygiene, various epidemics were prevalent, and working people who could not live would often take risks. With such ideological raw materials, Hu Shi, who advocated "good people politics" in China at that time, sighed with emotion at "poverty, disease, ignorance, weakness, and stubbornness" and "five ghosts making trouble in China"; and like him, some upper-class Chinese who were somewhat ashamed of being Chinese, saw foreigners strutting around the country with great style, and at the same time were distressed that the people of their own country were not competitive, would naturally become supporters of the theory of racial superiority. Let's think about it! Before liberation, how many doctrines and theories were unfavorable to the people's revolutionary cause and the cause of national liberation! Now they have all unintentionally converged or subtly changed? For society, our personal unrestrained, detached, and independent "freedom" is always too limited. At present, socialist transformation and socialist construction have completely changed the essence and overall appearance of our society. It may not be easy for anyone who wants to retain the past ideas and live in the old world of ideas without any change. Whether anyone wants it or not, likes it or not, we are all materialists to a certain extent, and if we are not too forgetful, we even seem to be "practitioners" of dialectical materialism!
    However, when we say that the environment has changed, the nature and appearance of society have changed, and no one can but gradually and spontaneously change or transform his thinking to a certain extent, it can only be regarded as a favorable condition for us to carry out political and ideological education, and it can never be regarded as a reason for us to relax political and ideological education. Because as far as our universities are concerned, we still have so many characteristics that should strengthen and accelerate ideological transformation:
    1. People's thinking is generally lagging behind reality. To accelerate socialist transformation or construction work, it is required that the thinking of cadres who are doing leadership work can at least keep up with reality, or not lag behind reality too much. Universities are places to train national construction cadres. In our country with backward culture and technology, the cadres trained by universities are more urgently needed to have higher political consciousness, so as to lead everyone to move forward together. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to strengthen their political and ideological education in various ways.
    2. Today's social change is not only different from the replacement of feudal dynasties in Chinese history, but also different from the changes in different forms of ownership in various private societies in the past. It is a great transition from private society to public society. Therefore, the class resistance we encounter is not limited to the bourgeoisie. All the remnants and residual thoughts of private rights or privileges related to all class societies in the past will become obstacles to our progress. It is obviously not enough to completely eradicate the centuries-old system of exploitation, especially the idea of exploitation, with several years of reform and transformation work. Moreover, the earth-shaking changes in our society can only be seen more clearly in the countryside. In cities that only use peaceful methods of transformation, it is not so obvious; and in universities that are generally located in large or medium-sized cities, due to the implementation of various care policies for intellectuals, the atmosphere of change is naturally thinner. Some people accuse universities of being air-raid shelters for escaping social revolutionary struggles, which is not entirely unfounded.
    3. Today's teachers in universities undoubtedly have the vast majority of them from bureaucratic, landlord, bourgeois, and petty-bourgeois families in the past. Even today's university students, who are truly from working-class or poor peasant families, are really very limited. Generally speaking, people from this background have not been tempered by fierce revolutionary struggles, have always lived in universities of the above-mentioned nature in large or medium-sized cities, and the teaching and learning work they are engaged in is more or less, or even greatly, distant from actual social life. In this way, although our society or country has very earnest expectations for universities, for educators in universities, especially for university students, generally speaking, the various free and undisciplined performances of people in our universities, due to some separation from reality, are more seriously separated from the workers and peasants, and are unwittingly regarded by a few ambitious politicians and scholars as a good place for them to sow the seeds of bourgeois freedom and democracy. This is what people in our universities should be ashamed of and take as a warning.
    4. People familiar with the actual situation of universities are clear that there is an increasingly obvious tendency in our universities today, that is, everyone seems to demand too much and too harshly from the country, and seems to demand too little from themselves. This is reflected in the haggling over daily living conditions, working conditions, family care, and disease care. As far as university students are concerned, they probably make demands more from their own wishes and less from the specific conditions and needs of the country. The job application forms filled out by each year's graduating students fully reflect this ideological situation; and judging from the general trend over the years since liberation, their tendency is not weakening, but strengthening and becoming more and more blatant. They strive to obtain reasonable socialist treatment in terms of enjoying public medical care, etc., while strongly demanding capitalist freedom of choice in job allocation. Judging from the wishes of all graduating students in the university where I work, everyone almost unanimously demands to work in large cities, large organizations, large scientific research institutions, and universities, fearing to go to small cities, fearing to go to remote areas, fearing to go to the countryside, fearing to go to unclean factories and mines, fearing to be secondary school teachers, and even think that it is a waste of talent and delays the future to be an assistant teacher in a junior college - isn't this tendency worth our attention and vigilance?!
    How to Strengthen Political and Ideological Education in Universities
    Of course, the trend I pointed out above may not be the same or quite unbalanced in the performance of universities and colleges across the country; and since liberation, our national university educators and students, like the people across the country, under the leadership and education of the Party, combined with various reform movements, have also greatly transformed themselves, and have also diligently completed various teaching tasks and teaching reform work. It is not true to say that our institutions of higher learning have not made great achievements or great improvements in recent years. And what I cannot help but say here is that our new society expects too much from universities, so the requirements cannot but be slightly higher, and the capitalist individual freedom trend that has gradually grown in the past year or so really needs our sufficient attention. I believe that the important key to reversing this bias lies in strengthening Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education. We have not done enough in this area in the past. How to strengthen political and ideological education in universities, there can be different contents and practices in each historical stage of occurrence, and the urgent way to remedy the current shortcomings, I think should start from the following aspects:
    First of all, the school Party committee needs to pay more attention to the political and ideological education work of the whole school. But I do not agree with the statement of some people with ulterior motives that the Party committee only wants to manage social activities and political and ideological education in the school, and entrusts personnel, finance, and scientific teaching work to the so-called academic committee, which is tantamount to weakening or narrowing the scope of the Party's leadership in the school, and canceling the primary task of the Party to conduct comprehensive leadership through guidelines and policies. This is very wrong. However, starting from the nature of the Party's work in the school and the importance of political and ideological education, in the past, the Party's leadership work in the school did not place the political education work of all teachers and staff, or even the Party members and League members, in an appropriate position, and managed and grasped too much of the general affairs of the school, which would inevitably lose the leadership core and reduce the leadership quality. During the transition period, the school's tasks were piled up and the work was rolling, and in order to complete the tasks and promote the work, this situation was really difficult to avoid. But it will not work to continue like this. As some people criticize, the generalization, formalization, and dogmatization of political education work will cause, and have already caused, a lot of damage.
    Secondly, if the school Party committee focuses more attention on political and ideological education work, it will find that in carrying out this work in universities, it is necessary to pay special attention to the different characteristics of universities from general administrative organs or mass organizations. The masses or intellectuals in universities generally have considerable culture and are relatively able to understand the Party's guidelines and policies through writing, but our general class background is not very good. How can we gradually change our class ideology and consciousness? The nature of our teaching work is somewhat inevitably divorced from reality. How can we make our teaching and research work more closely related to reality? It is not easy for us to see or understand the suffering and work dynamics of the working class and peasant masses in universities. How can we make up for this shortcoming and prevent us from regarding ourselves as special figures above the working people? These are some characteristics that are closely related in essence, and they should also be the starting point for the school Party committee to carry out political and ideological education work.
    Thirdly, aiming at the above-mentioned characteristics of universities, or aiming at the ideological dynamics of intellectuals in universities, in addition to using all possible opportunities to instill Marxist-Leninist class theory and reveal the actual situation of class growth and decline in our society to improve their political understanding, the Party's political and ideological education work in schools seems to focus on how to make our teaching and scientific research work more closely related to reality, and how to make our lives, thoughts, habits, and feelings more closely related to the working people. This is the clear direction of our socialist universities, and it is undoubtedly the definite policy of the school Party to carry out political and ideological education. On the one hand, the Party Central Committee is gradually correcting the theoretical separation from reality in the scientific and higher education circles through national scientific planning, through the allocation of teaching conditions, and through practical training, and at the same time, it is vigorously advocating labor education, advocating the combination of mental and physical laborers, determining that senior cadres take the lead in engaging in certain productive labor, and attempting to formulate methods for university students to engage in productive labor for a certain period of time, in order to correct their tendency to deviate from the laboring masses. With clear directions and policies, the problem lies in how to combine the specific environment and conditions of the school, and in accordance with the different ideological situations of teachers and students, to determine some practical and effective practices that are mutually coordinated. If the school Party committee focuses more attention on this aspect, using the wisdom of the school's masses or various organizations, I think all effective specific methods will follow the Party's call.
    As everyone knows, our country's socialist transformation has been basically completed, and our socialist construction is advancing rapidly, and at the same time, the new theories constantly put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in conjunction with that transformation and construction practice are constantly enlightening us, inspiring us, and teaching us. Although the family composition or class relations of our university teachers and even students are somewhat distant from the working class and peasant people, we are all mental laborers, or will become mental laborers. We generally love our country, love socialism, and sincerely safeguard the leadership of the Party. With so many favorable conditions, as long as our Party and the school Party committee strengthen leadership, and in the future, better carry out political and ideological education work in accordance with the method of unity, persuasion, and education of correctly handling contradictions among the people, I believe that the teachers and students of our universities will definitely give them enthusiastic support.
    I hope my immature opinions will be forgiven and corrected by all the delegates.

### 大学里必须加强政治思想教育  王亚南的发言

专栏：

    大学里必须加强政治思想教育
    王亚南的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告及大会的其他各项报告。
    现在请允许我谈谈大学中的政治思想教育问题。为了说明的方便，我的谈话分作以下几点：
      从厦门到北京途中一直想到的问题
    我在厦门大学担任行政工作。当我这次来北京开会，刚要动身的时候，一位负责政治课的教师告知我，有一些学生在酝酿反对政治课考试。提出的理由是：政治课原应改为在自愿基础上选修的课程，目前政治课问题很多，考试就没有多大的意义。措词颇激烈，并要求通过广播台广播他们号召大家一齐来反对考试的意见。我因仓促就道，临时提了这几点看法，要他劝告学生，并提请学校党委考虑处理：
    1．我们国家的社会主义建设，是在中国共产党领导下进行的。党是把马克思列宁主义作为指导思想来进行领导的。我们要社会主义建设，要共产党领导，就必须进行马克思列宁主义学习。大学生是被培养出来充当国家建设干部的。他们不学习马克思列宁主义，就不懂得我们为什么必须建设社会主义，为什么要在共产党领导下才能建设社会主义；更不会懂得他们自己是受人民委托，为服务人民而学习。大学里的政治课，是我们进行马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育的重要工具。大学生要他们在目前学习中，在今后工作中有一个方向，有一个动力，就一定要把政治课当作非学习不可的课程。
    2．目前政治课方面，无疑存在着不少问题：教学内容，教学质量，教学门类，都有值得商讨的余地。党中央及高等教育有关领导部门，正在考虑逐步解决和改进。但所有发生在政治课方面的问题，也都在不同程度发生在基础课乃至专业课方面，那不应当成为我们青年学生对政治课学习抱着否定态度的根据。
    3．当然，认为学习政治课没有多大意义，因而对于正在学习中的政治课，提出不考试的要求，这种学生，也许不是很多，但即使有不少学生，甚至有大部分学生受其宣传鼓动，也必须坚持非考不可的原则。事关国家政令、学校纪律，不能作无原则的迁就。
    在我把这几点意见提出而离开学校以后，一路不时想到这个问题。在全国正在大放大鸣的气氛中，我并不怎么担心学校竟会因为这个问题引起什么乱子，而所放心不下的，宁在于学生即使勉强接受劝告考试了，他们有些人不重视政治课，不重视政治思想教育的问题，并没有好好得到解决。为什么呢？因为：
      学生不重视政治课并非偶然发生的
    在解放后，特别在解放最初四、五年间，一般大学生对于政治课，对于马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育，是非常认真学习的。大家把政治课考差了，看作是很不光彩的事。对于抗美援朝、土改、三反五反一类社会政治运动，绝大多数人都愿意踊跃参加，因而他们在服从国家需要、担任困难工作等方面表现的社会主义觉悟和政治品质，也大大提高了。但最近一年多以来，尽管学校仍有很大一部分学生，还保持着相当重视政治课和社会政治活动的倾向，但有种种迹象表明，他们的那种思想动态，已因校内外愈来愈大的精神压力，而感到难于勉强维持了。
    我们知道，青年学生的感染性和可塑性是相当大的。当校内外充满了政治变革气氛；学校的教师，特别是那些对他们有威望的教师，也都认真学习政治，积极参加政治及教育改革活动，有的人并还通过夜大学系统钻研马克思列宁主义理论的时候，那对于大学生重视政治思想教育，显然具有决定的影响。但当情形不是这样的时候，相反的影响，也就很快要跟着表现出来。一九五六年原是中国社会大转变的一年。党中央预见到顺利完成那种社会大转变，紧接着就要提出加速提高科学技术水平的要求，于是就对进一步贯彻知识分子政策作了种种努力，就对全国文教科技界提出了向科学大进军的号召，而为了增强这一措施的积极效果，同时并还广泛宣扬艺术科学上的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。所有这些方面的努力，本来丝毫也没有减弱政治思想教育的意图，但也许因此把大家的注意力更多地导向业务方面或科学研究方面了，以致在教师中，甚至在一般青年教师中，很快就把政治和业务对立起来考虑，以为学习政治，成了专精业务的绊脚石；马列主义夜大学愈来愈像成为大家的思想负担了，马克思列宁主义也像愈来愈没有什么好学了，有关工会活动的工作，几乎没有什么人想搞了；兼任行政工作的教师，在找寻这样那样的口实打退堂鼓了；有的人并还多方要求少教课或不教课，以便让他们有更多时间钻研出一个什么一鸣惊人的名堂来；政治课的教师以及搞党团工作的干部，也似变得劲头不大了。这情况，这环境，对于学生学习政治课，已够不利了。适会高等教育部根据百家争鸣方针，提示我们在学习苏联先进科学和先进教学制度的同时，也不妨适当吸收资本主义国家的有益经验，并强调改变学生刻板生活，于是，依照事物内部的逻辑发展联系或连锁反应，忽视纪律组织的个人自由主义倾向，很快就感到教学计划对于教者学者都是一个拘束；学习俄文的热潮也不那么高了；对于有些人说来，英美的科学和教育制度，当然更合味口；在他们心目中，马克思列宁主义已不是什么指导思想，一降而为只不过是百家争鸣中的“一家之言”，再降而为纯系过了时的“教条”了。这一切，不正好说明有些学生对政治课抱有反感，反对政治课考试，无非是当前大学中存在的一系列偏差问题中的连锁反应的一个环节。那些问题（不论是把政治和业务对立来看，是把学习苏联和学习英美等同来看，抑是把关系人类历史命运的马列学说和资产阶级的某个派系的理论看得没有差别）对于有的人来说，也许是带有根本性质的，而在多数人，却只不过是一时认识不清，出于盲从的结果。但无论从那方面说来，加强大学中的政治思想教育，加强知识分子的思想改造，都证明是刻不容缓的，虽然我们还有必要进一步说明其中的道理。
    进一步分析大学中的知识分子改造的必要性
    是的，现在已有个别高级知识分子，昌言反对思想改造，并还在论坛上引起了有些人的共鸣。其实，仔细想想，我们活到五十岁以上的人，我们的思想，已经不自觉地，或自我适应地改造过了好几次。直到十九世纪二十年代，我们大家恐怕满脑子还是封建思想；到了三十年代、四十年代，资产阶级的思想意识占了上风，同时有些人还被灌输了一些在当时有些危险的社会主义思想；临到五十年代，危险思想不危险了，大家或者还自觉地感到，多吸收一点也不妨或有必要了，所以，那怕是在口头上非常反对思想改造的人，或者决意要保持“清高”令誉和“硬骨头”风格的人，也实在无法阻止他们自己的“日日新，又日新”的倾向。因为人有所思想，究不能不有思想的原料或环境，思想的原料改变了，环境改变了，他就不能不跟着想一些新的东西了。过去人民非常穷困，社会风习非常坏，到处匪盗如毛，受教育的人很少，不讲卫生，各种疫疠流行，生活不下去的劳动人民，不时挺而走险，有了这样一些思想的原料，所以当时在国内主张“好人政治”的胡适其人，便慨然叹息于“贫、病、愚、弱、顽”、“五鬼闹中华”；而和他一样有些自惭是中国人的高等华人们，一见到洋大人在全国各地横行阔步，气派十足，同时又痛心疾首于本国人民都不争气，自然会成为种族优劣论的拥护者。我们试想想吧！解放以前，诸如此类的不利于人民革命事业，不利于民族解放事业的学说理论，该有多少啊！现在不都无意地收敛起来，或潜移默化地在改变么？对于社会来讲，我们个人的潇洒出尘的，遗世而独立的“自由”，总是太有限制的。在目前，社会主义的改造，社会主义的建设，已把我们社会的本质和整个面貌全改变过来了，谁要想原封不动地保留住过去的念头和想法，生活在旧的观念世界中，怕不怎么容易吧。不管谁愿意不愿意，喜欢不喜欢，我们大家在一定程度上竟是唯物主义者，如果不太健忘的话，甚且还像是辩证唯物主义的“实践者”哩！
    不过，当我们说，环境改变了，社会性质和面貌改变了，任谁都不能不在一定程度上逐渐自发地改变或改造他的思想的时候，那只能看作是我们进行政治思想教育的有利条件，决不能看为是我们无妨放松政治思想教育的什么理由。因为就我们大学说，我们还有这许多应当加强加速思想改造的特点：
    1．人们的思想，一般总是落后于现实的。而要加速进行社会主义改造或建设工作，又要求作领导工作的干部的思想至少能跟上现实，或者不太落后于现实。大学是培养国家建设干部的场所，在我们文化技术落后的国家，由大学培养出来的干部，更迫切需要有较高的政治觉悟，以便带动大家一同前进，因此，以各种方式加强他们的政治思想教育，就是万分必要的。
    2．我们今天的社会变革，不仅不同于中国历代封建王朝的更替，也不同于以往各种私有社会的不同所有形态的改变，而是由私有社会到公有社会的大转变。因此，我们所遭遇的阶级反抗，就不限于来自资产阶级，以往一切阶级社会有关私有权或特权的遗制遗习和残余思想，都要成为我们前进的阻力。要想用几年的改革改造工作，完全根除几百年的剥削制度特别是剥削思想，那显然是非常不够的。而况我们社会的翻天复地的大变化，惟有在农村中看得比较明白，到了只采用和平方式改造的都市，就不那么明显了；而在一般都设置在大都市或中等都市中的大学里面，由于贯彻了有关知识分子的多方照顾政策，变革气氛自然更要稀薄一些，有些人指责大学是逃避社会革命斗争的防空洞，那并不是全无根据的话。
    3．今日大学中的教师，无疑有绝大部分是过去官僚、地主、资产阶级以及小资产阶级家庭出身的，就是今日的大学生，真正是出身于工人阶级或贫苦农民家庭的，也实在有限得很。这样出身的一般人，没有通过火热的革命斗争锻炼，一向生活在上述那种性质的大都市或中等都市的大学里，而所从事的教与学的工作，又多少甚或大大地和社会实际生活保持着距离。这一来，我们的社会或国家，尽管对大学、对大学的教育工作者，特别是对大学生，有着非常殷切的期待，但一般地说，我们大学中人的种种自由散漫表现，由于有些脱离实际，更加严重地脱离工农群众，遂不期然而然的被少数野心的政客、学者看作是他们撒播资产阶级自由民主种子的大好园地。这是我们大学中人应当引为耻辱，引为殷鉴的。
    4．熟习大学实况的人，都清楚我们今日大学中几乎是愈来愈明显地存在着一种倾向，就是大家对国家似乎要求得过多过苛了一些，而对自己又似乎要求得太不够了一些，这表现在有关日常生活条件，工作条件，家庭照顾，疾病照顾等方面的斤斤计较上，就大学生方面讲，他们有所要求，大概从自己愿望出发的多，从国家具体条件和需要出发的少。每年度应届毕业生所填的分配工作志愿表，就充分反映了这种思想情况；而且从解放后历年来的一般趋势看来，他们的那种倾向，不是愈来愈减弱，而是愈来愈加强，愈来愈露骨了。在享受公费医疗等方面，力求取得社会主义的合理待遇，而在工作分配上则强烈要求资本主义的自由选择。就我所服务的大学的全部应届毕业生的志愿讲，大家几乎近似不约而同地要求在大城市、大机关、大的科学研究机关和大学中工作，怕到小城市，怕到边远地区，怕到农村，怕到不清洁的厂矿，怕当中学教师，甚至去当专科学院的助教，也认为是大材小用，耽误了前途——这倾向，还不值得我们注意和警惕么？！
    如何加强大学的政治思想教育工作
    当然，我在上面指出的这种趋势，也许在全国各大学各高等学校的表现是不尽相同的或者是颇不平衡的；并且，解放以来，我们全国的大学教育工作者、学生，也同全国人民一样，在党的领导和教育下，结合各种改革运动，也大大地改造了自己，并也辛勤努力地完成了各项教学任务和教学改革工作，说我们高等学校几年来没有取得很大的成绩，没有很大的改进，那决不是事实。而我在这里所不能己于言的，乃在我们新社会对于大学的期待太殷切，因而要求也就不能不稍高一些，而由于上述的大学教育的特点，一年多来逐渐滋长的资本主义的个人自由倾向，实在需要我们有足够的重视。我认为，扭转这种偏向的重要关键，是在于加强马克思列宁主义的政治思想教育，我们以往在这方面是做得太不够的。如何加强大学的政治思想教育，在各个发生的历史阶段，可以有不同的内容和做法，而目前迫切需要采行的补偏救弊途径，我以为应从以次几个方面着手：
    首先，学校党委需要更加重视全校的政治思想教育工作。但我不同意有些别有用心的人的讲法，以为党委在学校里只望要管社会活动和政治思想教育，而把人事、财务及科学教学工作，委之于所谓学术委员会，这样就无异削弱或缩小党在学校的领导范围，把党委通过方针政策来进行全面领导的首要任务给取消了。这是非常错误的。但从学校党的工作性质出发，从政治思想教育的重要性出发，以往党在学校的领导工作，确是没有把全校教职员工甚且没有把党团员的政治教育工作，放在适当的地位，对学校一般事务管得太多，抓得太滥，就一定要失去领导核心，降低领导质量。在过渡期间，学校任务成堆，工作打滚，为了完成任务，推进工作，这情况也实在难于避免。但长此下去是不行的。如有些人所指责的政治教育工作一般化，形式化，教条化，是会造成、并且已经造成了不少损害的。
    其次，学校党委如其把注意力更多地集中到政治思想教育工作方面，它就会发现在大学里进行这项工作，要特别注意大学和一般行政机关或群众团体的不同特点，大学里的群众或知识分子，一般是有相当文化的，是比较能通过文字了解党的方针政策的，但是，我们一般的阶级出身是不怎么好的，怎样才能好好地逐渐地改变我们的阶级思想意识呢？我们的教学工作的性质是有些难免脱离实际的，怎样才能使我们的教学研究工作更多的联系实际呢？我们在大学里面是不易见到乃至体会到工农劳动群众的疾苦和工作动态的，怎样补救这个缺点，使我们不要把自己看为是超在劳动人民之上的特殊人物呢？这是相互有密切的本质联系的一些特点，同时也应该是学校党委进行政治思想教育工作的出发点。
    又其次，对准了上述的大学的特点，或者对准了大学知识分子的思想动态，学校党的政治思想教育工作，除了应利用一切可能的机会，多方灌输马列主义的阶级理论及揭示我们社会的阶级消长变化实况，以提高其政治认识外，似乎还当在如何使我们的教学和科学研究工作更密切地联系实际，以及如何使我们的生活、思想、习惯、感情更多地接近劳动人民。这是我们社会主义大学的明确方向，也无疑是学校党进行政治思想教育的确定方针。党中央一方面在通过全国性的科学规划，通过教学条件配备及生产实习等方式，以期逐渐端正科学界和高等教育界的理论脱离实际倾向，同时又在大事宣扬劳动教育，宣扬脑力劳动与体力劳动者结合，确定高级干部率先从事一定生产劳动，并企图拟制大学生从事一定期间生产劳动办法，以期端正他们脱离劳动群众倾向。方向方针明确了，问题就在如何结合学校的具体环境，具体条件，依据教师学生的不同思想情况，定出一些切实有效而又相互配合的做法。学校党委如其把更多的注意力集中到这方面来，运用学校群众或各种组织的智慧，我看一切有效的具体办法，都会紧随着党的号召而发现出来的。
    大家知道，我们国家的社会主义改造，已基本完成，我们的社会主义建设，又在一日千里地向前猛进，同时，党中央及毛主席结合着那种改造建设实践不绝提出的新的理论，又在不绝启迪我们，感召我们，教导我们，尽管我们大学的教师乃至学生的家庭成分或阶级关系，和工农劳动人民有一定距离，但我们都是精神劳动者，或将要成为精神劳动者，我们一般是热爱我们的国家，热爱社会主义，并衷心维护党的领导的。有了这许多有利条件，只要我们党、学校的党委加强领导，今后更好的依据正确处理人民内部矛盾的团结说服教育方法，来进行政治思想教育工作，我相信，我们大学的教师和同学，是一定会给予以热烈的拥护和支持的。
    我的不成熟意见，希望得到诸位代表的原谅和教正。
