    Qingdao Fresh Kelp Enters the Market

    By the 24th of this month, Qingdao had harvested over 9 million jin of fresh kelp, an increase of about one and a half times compared to last year. More than 600,000 jin of fresh kelp have been transported to cities such as Beijing, Taiyuan, and Tianjin.

    This year, Qingdao kelp matured half a month earlier than in previous years, and it grew thick and long. The average length of each kelp is about half a meter longer than last year, and the unit yield per seedling rope has increased from 15 kilograms last year to 18 kilograms. ·Hua Li·
