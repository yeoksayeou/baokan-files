Use Facts to Expose the Lies of the Rightists
Xia Nai

This time, taking advantage of the rectification movement, the rightists, under the banner of helping the Party rectify its work, "hung up a sheep's head but sold dog meat," and took the opportunity to attack the Party and oppose socialism and the Party's leadership. Recent exposure of a large number of materials has revealed their true colors. I would like to say a few words on the issue of scientific work.

The rightists have exploited some intellectuals' long-standing neglect of politics, deliberately distorting the facts and trying to provoke the relationship between the Party and scientists in order to fish in troubled waters and usurp leadership of scientific work. On the one hand, they deny the development and achievements of scientific work since liberation; on the other hand, they strike a pose and put forward the slogan of "protecting scientists." As an archaeologist, I can present ironclad facts to expose their lies. Since liberation, archaeological work in our country has achieved unprecedented leapfrog development. From the "countable on fingers" few archaeologists in the past, it has now grown into a team of four or five hundred people, and we still feel that manpower is not enough. The leaders of archaeological surveys and excavations everywhere are almost all young scientists who have devoted themselves to field archaeology since liberation. These new forces are cultivated on socialist soil. In the past, it took more than ten years (1936-48) to compile four "Archaeological Reports." Now we can compile four volumes every year, and we still have the energy to compile two publications, "Archaeology Newsletter" and "Cultural Relics Reference Materials." In the past, each issue was only printed from three hundred to five hundred copies and often remained in stock for a long time. Now, each issue is printed from two thousand six hundred to two thousand eight hundred copies, and it sells out within a few days of publication. In the past, excavation and printing costs had to be planned by ourselves, begging everywhere, and still not necessarily getting a penny of support. Now, with the strong support of the Party and the government, a large amount of funds has been allocated, so that we do not have to worry about this matter. In this way, we have achieved more results in a few years than in the previous decades.

The rightists believe that the Party cannot lead science. They said that scientific work has "stagnated" or "regressed" since liberation, and that scientists have been "threatened" and need "protection" in order to gain the sympathy of scientists. Then, they advocated no scientific planning, no unified academic leadership, and no "locomotive." As far as archaeological work is concerned, what we need is to strengthen leadership, not to weaken it. We have suffered a lot of losses in our work because of the lack of planning and insufficient unified leadership. The rightists conspired to usurp the leadership of the Party, first striving to "scatteredly" dominate one side, and then further seizing the entire leadership of scientific work. We must thoroughly crush their conspiracy.

Scientific workers should actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle, continue to criticize and expose them, and take advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated enemies, in order to achieve a comprehensive victory. And they must temper themselves in the struggle, further improve their political level, and unite around the Party to march towards science.

    用事实揭穿右派谎言
    夏鼐
    这次右派分子利用整风运动的机会，打着帮助党整风的旗帜，“挂羊头卖狗肉”，乘机向党进攻，反对社会主义、反对党的领导。最近大批材料的揭露，已经使他们原形毕现。我现在只就有关科学工作问题来谈几句话。
    右派分子利用有些知识分子向来忽视政治的这一缺点，故意歪曲事实，想挑拨党和科学家的关系，以便混水摸鱼，篡夺科学工作的领导权。他们一方面抹煞了解放以来科学工作的发展和成就，另一方面装腔做势，提出“保护科学家”的口号。我是一个考古工作者，我从亲身的经历中可以提出铁一般的事实来揭穿他们的谎话。解放以后，我国考古工作得到了空前的飞跃发展。从前是“屈指可数”的寥寥几个考古工作者，现已长成为四五百人的大队伍，而且仍感觉到人力不够。各处的考古调查发掘工作的领队人，差不多都是解放以后才投身于田野考古的青年科学家。这些新生力量是在社会主义的田地上培养出来的。从前要十多年（1936—48）才编出四本“考古学报”，现在我们可以每年编出四本，而且还有余力编出“考古通讯”和“文物参考资料”二种刊物。从前每期只印三百本到五百本，还常长期压积。现在每期二千六百本到二千八百本，出版后没有几天便脱销。从前发掘工作费和印刷费，都要自己筹划，到处叩头，仍不一定能获得分文支援。现今党和政府的大力支持，拨来大量经费，使我们不必为这事操心了。这样，便使我们在几年以内，获得了超过以前几十年的成绩。
    右派分子以为党不能领导科学。他们说：解放后科学工作“停滞”或“倒退”了，科学家受到“威胁”须要“保护”了，以求取得科学家的同情。然后，他们主张不要科学规划，不要统一的学术领导，不要“火车头”。就考古工作而言，我们所需要的，是加强领导，而不是减弱领导。我们曾经因为计划性不强，统一领导不够，给工作带来了不少的损失。右派分子阴谋篡夺党的领导，首先争取“分散地”独霸一方，然后更进一步夺取科学工作的整个领导权。我们必须彻底粉碎他们的阴谋。
    科学工作者要积极投入反右派斗争中，要对他们继续加以批判和揭露，乘胜逐北，以求取得全面的胜利。并且要在斗争中锻炼自己，进一步提高自己的政治水平，团结在党的周围向科学进军。
