    Brown Sugar Isn't Sweet

    Recently, the supply of white sugar has been insufficient, and people have had to use brown sugar as a substitute. However, the brown sugar I bought isn't sweet enough. Even the sugar sellers say, "Now two jin of brown sugar aren't as good as one jin used to be." When you dissolve it in water, there's a layer of broken grass and hemp fibers floating on top, and a thick layer of dirt and sand settles at the bottom. The taste isn't right either, and children are always reluctant to drink it. Sugar factories should improve the quality of brown sugar and its packaging methods to better meet consumer needs.

    红糖不甜
    最近白糖供应不足，人们只能用红糖来代替。可是我买的红糖不够甜，连卖糖的都说“现在二斤红糖也顶不上过去一斤吃”。泡水喝的时候，水上面浮着一层碎草、麻丝，水底下澄起厚厚一层土和砂子，味道也不正，小孩子总是不愿意喝。制糖厂应该改进红糖的质量和包装方法，更好地满足消费者需要。
