    Lin Xiling's Father Trained by Huang Shaohong
    Revealed by People of Ruoheng District, Wenling County, Her Hometown
    (Our report) The reactionary remarks of Lin Xiling, a rightist element at the Renmin University of China, have caused great anger among the local people in her hometown (Ruoheng District, Wenling County, Zhejiang Province). After Lin Xiling joined the revolution, her family has always been cared for by the local government and the masses. Her family has a mother and three younger sisters. Before joining the advanced agricultural cooperative, the villagers cultivated the land for her family, and during the New Year, the masses also sent New Year cakes to her family. Her three younger sisters are studying at school and enjoy people's grants. The local people said, "Lin Xiling still says the Communist Party is not good. Hasn't the people led by the Communist Party treated her and her family well? This person really has no conscience."
    Local people revealed that the rightist Huang Shaohong has had old relations with Lin Xiling for a long time. Huang Shaohong and Lin Xiling's father, Cheng Yipin, were very close. In 1940, when Huang Shaohong was the head of the Zhejiang Provincial Political Personnel Training Corps, Cheng Yipin had been trained in the corps. It is not without reason that Lin Xiling's reactionary remarks could get Huang Shaohong's support. In addition, Lin Xiling's reactionary thinking has a lot to do with her family's political background. Her father, Cheng Yipin, was a petty bureaucrat before liberation and held many reactionary positions in the Kuomintang, such as Director of Wenling County Taxation Bureau, concurrently Director of Commercial Registration Office, Chief of Civil Affairs Section of Yuhuan County, and Chief of Education Section of Pingyang County. Her mother is a leader of the Jesus Church and has always been dissatisfied with the People's Government. Her father was a person who lorded it over the people and has long since fled to Hong Kong. Although the People's Government and local people are taking care of her family today, they can no longer enjoy the shameless life of the Kuomintang era. Therefore, Lin Xiling hates the Communist Party so much, which has historical reasons.

### 林希翎的父亲受过黄绍竑训练  她的家乡温岭县箬横区人民揭露

    林希翎的父亲受过黄绍竑训练
    她的家乡温岭县箬横区人民揭露
    本报讯　中国人民大学右派分子林希翎的反动言论传到她的家乡（浙江省温岭县箬横区）后，引起当地群众的极大愤怒。林希翎参加革命后，她家里一直是受到当地政府和群众的关怀。她家里有一个母亲、三个妹妹，在没有加入高级农业社以前，村里群众给她家代耕土地，到过年过节时，群众还送年糕给她家。她的三个妹妹在校读书，都享受人民助学金的待遇。当地群众说，林希翎还说共产党不好，难道共产党领导的人民对待她和她的家庭还不好吗？这个人真是没有良心。
    当地群众揭发，右派分子黄绍竑与林希翎早就有老关系，黄绍竑和林希翎的父亲程一品很要好。1940年，黄绍竑在浙江省政治人员训练团担任团长时，程一品曾在该团受过训。林希翎的反动言论能得到黄绍竑的支持，这也是不为无因的了。另外，林希翎的反动思想与家庭的政治背景有很大关系，她的父亲程一品解放前是一个小官僚，担任过国民党的许多反动职务。如温岭县税务局主任，兼商业登记处主任，玉环县民政科长，平阳县教育科长等等。她的母亲是个耶稣教头目，对人民政府一贯不满，她的父亲是站在人民头上作威作福的人，早已逃跑到香港去了。今天虽然人民政府和当地群众对她家里给予照顾，但是他们再也不能享受国民党统治时期的无耻生活了。所以，林希翎这样痛恨共产党，是有历史原因的。
