Then, Chu Anping explained his relationship with Zhang Bojun, saying that his relationship with Zhang Bojun was more complicated than that with Luo Longji.

Last November, while I was in Qingdao, Zhang Bojun gave me a letter, the gist of which was about the various parties recommending me as the editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily. He hoped I would return to Beijing as soon as possible.

I returned to Beijing at the end of February this year. In March, I went to see Zhang Bojun. At that time, the CPPCC National Committee was being held and he was very busy. He said he would arrange for me, Sa Kongliao, and him to have a discussion in a few days. On March 20, the three of us met and talked. The main content of this conversation was about the Guangming Daily issue. At that time, we initially discussed adjusting the layout of the newspaper and canceling some supplements.

Chu Anping said that in subsequent work, he adopted a disciplined attitude in reporting his work to Zhang Bojun. He reported his work to Zhang Bojun four times on April 21, May 19, June 2, and June 8.

Zhang Bojun had the following opinions regarding Guangming Daily:

Regarding horizontal versus vertical typesetting, he said restoring vertical typesetting was also acceptable. He also said partial vertical typesetting was possible. Later, he discussed it with comrades in the newspaper office, but they did not agree, so no formal opinion was put forward.

He agreed to publish more news about people in the paper. He said, "Old society newspapers published a lot of people's activities, but current newspapers publish too little." He said a few words that revealed his ambition. I remember that when I was with him on the way to the newspaper office, he said, "Now everything is concentrated on a few people, and only a few people's names are seen in the newspapers. How can the country be run well like this?" He was very interested in increasing news about people, and he pointed out that news about responsible persons of democratic parties should be increased, which in essence probably referred to himself. He said this to me twice. This issue was reflected in my proposed plan for improving the newspaper.

Regarding international news, he advocated increasing news from capitalist countries, such as United Press and Reuters dispatches. I reflected his views in the international news section of the paper.

He expressed his agreement with my first report on the work of the newspaper, saying he supported me.

After April 21, I reported my work to him once in a letter, talking about changing the layout, adjusting the organization (no personnel changes), etc. On May 19, I went to his house, but there were too many people, so I didn't speak.

On June 2, after my erroneous remarks had already been made public, I went to him about the newspaper and he said to me at the time, "Your speech yesterday was very good."

I said, "If we're going to talk, let's talk about big issues! But it was very presumptuous." He said, "Yes, if we're going to talk, let's talk about big issues. Don't talk about trivial matters."

The fourth time was on June 8. Since big-character posters criticizing me had already been put up in the Guangming Daily office on June 7, I was still slow to realize that this was just a matter of personal opinion. By June 8, the People's Daily had already published criticisms of me. Seeing the situation, I could no longer continue working and had to resign to Zhang Bojun. At that time, he agreed to keep my resignation letter.

On June 12 (or possibly the 11th), Zhang Bojun came to my house to talk about celebrating the eighth anniversary of Guangming Daily. I had already resigned, so these things shouldn't have been discussed with me. Strangely, he didn't leave after he finished speaking. I thought he was coming to comfort me because my mood was low at the time. He asked me, "Is your burden heavy?" I replied, "Not too heavy." He said, "There are three situations that make things difficult: first, poor health; second, being too fame and fortune-oriented; and third, being oppressed by life. If you have these three situations, you have to come out and do things."

At that time, I said that my burden was not heavy, my children were grown, and I was not too fame and fortune-oriented. He said, "You can be more detached. You are not old, you can study ideological work more. There is no one today who can see things fifty years from now." What is the topic of research? Zhang said to Chu, "The Chinese Communist Party has several difficult problems that cannot be solved: 1. The peasant problem; 2. The student problem, many students cannot go to college; 3. Mistakes in economic construction." He also talked about the placement of more than ten million Communist Party members, saying that those who were originally clerks would become section chiefs after joining the Party, and those who were originally section chiefs would become division chiefs after joining the Party (and so on). This problem cannot be solved even with education.

He also said that another thing was that on June 8, I went to resign to him. It was 2 p.m. when I arrived. At that time, he said to me, "There is no one here, you can say anything."

Once I heard him say to someone else, "Those fake Marxists-Leninists, those who eat off Marxism-Leninism, are not going to work. Others have learned Marxism-Leninism, but they are not going to work." I realized he was referring to some people in the China Democratic League.

Regarding the Guangming Daily issue, Chu Anping explained: When I arrived at the newspaper office on April 11, I had sixteen characters in mind, namely "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence, mutual supervision." Later, I added a "let" character to encourage everyone to speak freely, to contend and let; second, I emphasized independence and autonomy, forgetting the leadership of the Party; third, I wanted to completely revise the newspaper, what kind of newspaper did I want to make? I wanted to use it to supervise each other, to criticize the Party and the government, and to understand contending and letting from an old democratic perspective.

At this time, someone asked Chu Anping: Who had seen the draft of his speech at the United Front Work Department symposium? Chu said: I didn't show it to anyone, but I discussed the content and meaning of the speech with Luo Longji and Qian Weichang. Chu Anping also said that he believed that the relationship between him and Zhang and Luo was mainly based on ideological resonance, and that his set of practices after arriving at Guangming Daily just conformed to the ambitions of their alliance.

### 在储的反动言论受到批评后  章伯钧安慰他为他安排退路

    在储的反动言论受到批评后
    章伯钧安慰他为他安排退路
    接着，储安平交代他和章伯钧的关系问题，他说，我和章伯钧的关系，比罗隆基要复杂一些。
    去年11月我在青岛，章伯钧给了我一封信，大意是谈各党派推我当光明日报的总编辑。希望我早日回京。
    今年2月底我回到北京。3月间我去看章伯钧，当时正在举行政协全国委员会，他很忙，他说过几天约我和萨空了三个人谈一次。到了3月20日，三个人见面说了，这次谈话的主要内容是谈到光明日报的问题。当时初步谈了一下调整报纸的版面问题和取消一些增刊问题。
    储安平说，在以后工作中，我是采取规规矩矩的态度向他汇报工作的。我于4月21日、5月19日、6月2日、6月8日一共向他汇报了四次工作。
    章伯钧对于光明日报的意见有以下几点：
    关于横排直排问题，他说恢复直排也可以。他又说也可以局部直排。后来与报馆中的同志谈过，因他们不赞成而未作正式意见提出。
    他赞成报上多登一些人的新闻。他说“旧社会的报纸登载人的活动多，现在的报纸登得太少了”。他说了几句话，暴露了他的野心。记得是在我同他到报社的路上，他说“现在什么事都集中在几个人身上，报纸上只见到几个人的名字，这样国家怎能办得好呢？”他对于增加人的新闻很有兴趣，他指出要增民主党派负责人的新闻，实质上恐就是指他自己。这样的话，他和我说过两次。这一问题，在我所拟订的改进报纸方案中有反映。
    关于国际新闻问题。他主张增加资本主义国家的电讯，如合众社、路透社的电讯。我在报上的国际新闻部分，反映了他的意见。
    他对于我第一次向他汇报的报社工作，他表示同意，他说他支持我。
      4月21日后，我用信向他汇报工作一次，是谈到改版面，机构调整（人事不动）等。5月19日，我到他家，因为人太多，没有讲。
      6月2日，我的错误言论已经出来了，我因为报社的事去找他，他当时对我说：“你昨天的发言很好”。
    我说：“要谈就谈大问题吧！不过放肆得很。”他说：“对，要谈就谈谈大问题，鸡毛蒜皮的问题就不要谈吧。”
    第四次是6月8日去的。由于6月7日光明日报社内已贴大字报批评我，我当时还很迟钝以为这只是个人意见问题。到了6月8日人民日报已登出对我的批评，我看情况不能再工作下去了，不能不向章伯钧辞职，当时他同意留下了我的辞职信。
    6月12日（也可能是11日）章伯钧来我家谈庆祝光明日报八周年问题，我已辞职，这些事本不要同我谈了。奇怪的是他说完了不走，我以为他是来安慰我，因为当时我的情绪很低。他问我说：“你的负担重不重？”我回答“不算重。”他说“有三种情况就困难，第一是身体不好，第二是名利心重了，第三是生活压迫。有这三种情况是非出来做事不可”。
    当时我说，我的负担不重，孩子大了，名利心也不重。他说“你可以超脱一些，你年龄不大，可以多研究些思想工作。今天能够看到五十年以后的事的人还没有。”研究的题目是什么呢？章对储说：“现在中国共产党有几个困难问题，不能解决。1、农民问题；2、学生问题，很多学生不能升学；3、经济建设出了错误。他又谈到一千多万共产党员的安排问题，他说，原来是科员的，入了党要做科长，原来是科长的入了党要做处长（余类推），这个问题用教育也不能解决。
    他又说，还有一件事，6月8日我向他辞职，是下午二时去的。当时他对我说：“我这里没有什么人，有话可说。”
    有次我听见他对别的人说：“那些假马列主义者、靠马列主义吃饭的人不行了，别人学会了马列主义了，他们反而不行了。”我体会是指民盟有些人。
    关于光明日报的问题，储安平交代说：我4月11日到报馆，当时思想里有十六个字，即“百花齐放，百家争鸣，长期共存，互相监督”，以后又加上一个“放”字，鼓励大家讲话，鸣、放；其次是偏重独立自主，忘了党的领导；再次是全面改版，想办成个什么样的报纸呢？就是想要互相监督，对党、对政府批评，用旧民主的观点理解鸣、放。
    这时，有人问储安平：在统战部座谈会上的发言稿，究竟那些人看过？储说：没有给谁看过，但是发言的内容和意思，我和罗隆基和钱伟长商量过。储安平还说，他认为他和章、罗之间的关系主要是思想有共鸣，是他到光明日报以后的一套做法刚好符合了他们同盟的野心。
