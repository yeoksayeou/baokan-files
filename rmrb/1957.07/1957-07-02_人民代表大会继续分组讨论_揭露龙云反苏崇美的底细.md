Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued group discussions this morning. Some representatives' groups further discussed Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report; some representatives' groups focused on discussing Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft."

During the discussions, some representatives sternly refuted Long Yun's anti-Soviet slanders; many representatives continued to criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois right-wingers.

Representatives of the Yunnan Province delegation have been focusing on refuting Long Yun's anti-Soviet slanders in recent days. Workers, peasants, and representatives of various ethnic groups in this group questioned whether Long Yun had forgotten the crimes he committed during his eighteen years of rule in Yunnan. Representatives such as Mei Yi and Zhu Jiabi listed many facts of Sino-Soviet friendship to refute Long Yun's fallacies. Mei Yi said that the Soviet Union had provided us with unprecedented sincere and selfless assistance. Both the Soviet Union and China are engaged in construction, and we cannot benefit ourselves at the expense of others. If we adopt the attitude of "what is mine is mine, and what is yours is also mine," can we still be considered friends? If the Soviet Union is weakened, it will weaken the entire socialist camp and ourselves. Regarding the issue of the Soviet army transporting some machines when it liberated Northeast China, Mei Yi believes that it was necessary for the Soviet army to do so at the time. The Kuomintang was attacking Northeast China at the time, and most of the machines transported by the Soviet Union were equipment from military factories. Does Long Yun advocate leaving these military factories to the Kuomintang regime to manufacture guns and cannons to slaughter the people? Zhu Jiabi said that Long Yun said his anti-Soviet remarks were out of "patriotism." Zhu Jiabi asked Long Yun, what kind of country do you love? The will of all Chinese people is unanimous, resolutely enhancing friendship with the Soviet Union and building a socialist society; but Long Yun is not like this. The wealth he plundered from the people during his eighteen years of rule in Yunnan is still in American banks. He naturally speaks well of the United States.

Many representatives of the Hebei Province delegation pointed out when criticizing Long Yun's anti-Soviet remarks that the Soviet Union is a true friend of the Chinese people. Shi Zhiren said, without the help of the Soviet Union, how could we build a 7,000-kilowatt heavy water atomic reactor and a cyclotron that can generate 25 million electron volts of particles? No other country besides socialist countries would help us so sincerely. Hubei Province representative and shipbuilding engineer Sa Benxin said that China's shipbuilding industry has advanced seventy or eighty years in a short period of time due to Soviet support. The representatives expressed their determination to resolutely counter the anti-Soviet conspiracy of the right-wingers and fully defend the great friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union.

    人民代表大会继续分组讨论
    揭露龙云反苏崇美的底细
    据新华社1日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午继续分组讨论。有些代表小组进一步讨论了周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告；有些代表小组集中讨论了李先念副总理“关于1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案的报告”。
    在讨论中，有些代表严正驳斥了龙云的反苏谰言；许多代表继续批判资产阶级右派分子的反动言行。
    云南省代表小组的代表连日来集中对龙云的反苏谰言进行了驳斥。这个小组的工人、农民以及各族代表责问龙云是否忘记了他统治云南十八年所犯的罪行。梅益、朱家璧等代表列举许多中苏友谊的事实驳斥龙云的反苏谬论。梅益说，苏联对我们进行了史无前例的真诚无私的帮助，苏联和中国都在进行建设，我们不能损人利己。假如采取“我的是我的，你的还是我的”的态度，还能算朋友吗？假如削弱了苏联，就是对整个社会主义阵营和我们自己的削弱。关于苏联军队解放东北时运走一些机器的问题，梅益认为苏军当时这样做是必要的，当时国民党正在进攻东北，苏联运走的机器多是军火工厂的装备，龙云是不是主张把这些军火厂留给国民党政权制造枪炮来屠杀人民呢？朱家璧说，龙云说他的反苏谰调是出于
  “爱国”，朱家璧问龙云，究竟你爱的是什么样的国，我们全中国人民的意志是一面倒，坚决增进同苏联的友谊，建设社会主义社会；可是龙云却不是这样，他统治云南十八年，搜刮的民财至今还存在美国的银行里，他自然说美国的好话。
    河北省代表小组的许多代表在批判龙云等的反苏言论时指出，苏联是中国人民真正的好朋友。石志仁说，没有苏联的帮助，我们怎么能够建设七千瓩的重水型原子反应堆和能产生二千五百万电子伏的粒子的回旋加速器。除了社会主义国家以外，别的国家都不会这样真诚地帮助我们。湖北省代表、造船工程师萨本炘说，中国造船工业由于得到苏联的支援，在短短的时间内等于前进了七、八十年。代表们表示要坚决反击右派分子的反苏阴谋，全力保卫中苏两国的伟大友谊和团结。
