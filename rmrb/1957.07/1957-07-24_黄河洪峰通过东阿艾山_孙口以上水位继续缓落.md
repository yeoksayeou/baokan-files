Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 23rd: The Yellow River flood peak has passed Aishan in Dong'e County, Shandong Province, and the water level above Sunkou continues to fall slowly. At 12:00 today, 2,400 cubic meters per second of water from Dongping Lake flowed into the Yellow River; therefore, the passage of the Yellow River flood peak through the Aishan area was not clearly visible. By 19:00, the water level at Aishan had already dropped by three centimeters.

At 8:00 today, the flow of the Yellow River at Sunkou in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, was 8,900 cubic meters per second, a decrease of 1,500 cubic meters per second compared to the flow when the flood peak passed through here. At the same time, the flow at Gao Village in Dongming County, Henan Province, has dropped to 6,080 cubic meters per second.

Under the circumstances of rising river water, high water levels, and great pressure, seepage occurred on the back slopes of the embankments at Jingquan in Dong'e County and Hanliuzhuang Danger Zone in Qihe County, Shandong Province. The Yellow River maintenance sections of these two counties are taking measures to reinforce them. Some dangerous situations that occurred on the Yellow River dikes in Henan Province have been stopped from developing after vigorous rescue efforts.

In order to ensure that this Yellow River flood peak can safely flow into the sea, the flood control headquarters at all levels along the river in Shandong Province have actively organized a large number of flood control teams and increased flood control materials.

    黄河洪峰通过东阿艾山  孙口以上水位继续缓落
    据新华社郑州23日电　黄河洪峰已通过山东东阿县艾山，孙口以上水位继续缓落。今天十二时，东平湖里的水以两千四百秒公方的流量向黄河倾泄；因此黄河洪峰通过艾山一带时，难以明显的看出。到十九时，艾山的水位已经降低三公分。
    今天八时，山东省寿张县孙口的黄河流量为八千九百秒公方，比这次洪峰通过这里时的流量减少了一千五百秒公方。同时，河南省东明县高村流量已经降落到六千零八十秒公方。
    在河水上涨、水位高、压力大的情况下，山东省东阿县井圈和齐河县韩刘庄险工的堤背都发生渗漏现象，这两个县的黄河修防段正在设法抢护。河南省黄河堤坝发生的一些险象，都在大力抢护以后停止了发展。
    为使这次黄河洪峰能安全下泄入海，山东省沿河各级防汛指挥部已积极组织大批防汛队伍，增加防汛器材。
