Iron Cross Unearthed!

The mere mention of the Iron Cross evokes images of Hitler and his swastika-bearing SS troops, those figures of evil. The mere mention of the Iron Cross immediately stirs the indignation of the millions of victims of World War II. The Iron Cross was Hitler's medal, used to reward those subordinates who faithfully executed his orders; it is a symbol of aggression, plunder, and slaughter. In the initial years after the war, the "recipients" of the Iron Cross lacked the courage to wear it openly, as the prevailing atmosphere meant such an action would likely be met with retribution.

Now, with the resurgence of militarism in West Germany, the term "war criminal" has acquired a new interpretation in West German military manuals. "War criminal": is someone who should be granted the highest honors and highest position. Generals from the Hitler era are now once again taking up command positions. Speidel has become the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces Central Europe (NATO). Heusinger became the Inspector General of the West German Bundeswehr. On June 14, the Bonn government announced the promotion of these two former Nazi generals to the rank of four-star general.

That is not all. The West German Bundestag even passed a "Law on Medals" on June 28. According to this law, all "Orders of Merit" awarded by Hitler during World War II can now be openly worn, and the ribbons of these medals will still use the colors of the Hitler-era German flag. The Vice Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Mellis, denounced this bill, saying: "This bill is an insult to the millions of victims of Fascism." But what the West German ruling clique and its partners are concerned with is restoring the "honor" of Nazi soldiers.

The Iron Cross—the dark symbol of Fascism—has been unearthed again! This matter deserves the serious attention of all anti-fascist people.

### 铁十字勋章出土了！

    铁十字勋章出土了！
    一提起铁十字勋章，便会使人们联想起希特勒，记起他那批佩带着卐标记的党卫军的凶煞像。一提起铁十字勋章，立即会引起第二次世界大战中千百万受害者的愤慨。铁十字勋章，这是希特勒的勋章，用来赏赐那些忠诚地执行他的命令的部下的，它是侵略、掠夺、屠杀的标志。战后最初几年里，铁十字勋章的“荣获者”还没有勇气把它挂在胸前，那时的气氛使得这样的举动多少会要受到制裁。
    现在，随着军国主义在西德的复活，“战犯”这个词儿在西德的军人手册中有了新的注释。“战犯”：是应当授以最高荣誉，最高地位的人。希特勒时代的将帅们，如今一个个重新登上了统帅的座位。斯派达尔出任北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队的总司令。豪辛格当了西德国防军总监。6月14日，波恩政府宣布把这两个前纳粹将领晋升为四星上将。
    这还不够，西德联邦议会在6月28日竟通过了一项“勋章法”，根据这条法律，第二次世界大战期间希特勒所颁发的一切“功勋章”今后都可以公开佩带，而且勋章的绶带仍然采用希特勒德国国旗的颜色。社会民主党副主席梅利斯斥责这个法案说：“这一法案是对千百万法西斯主义受害者的侮辱。”但是西德统治集团及其合伙者所关切的却是恢复纳粹军人的“荣誉”。
    铁十字勋章——法西斯的黑暗的标志重新出土了！这件事情值得一切反法西斯的人士的严重注意。
