    US Aircraft Carrier Catches Fire
    The 40,000-ton American aircraft carrier "Lake Champlain" caught fire in the port of Marseilles on July 3. The fire was initially caused by a motorboat unloading vehicles from the ship. The flames quickly spread throughout the ship, with thick smoke rising thousands of feet. It took French fireboats two and a half hours to extinguish the fire.
