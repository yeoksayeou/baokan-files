I completely agree with and firmly support Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, China's 600 million people have achieved brilliant accomplishments in socialist construction, building upon the victory of the socialist revolution. The people of the whole country are cheering for this and are marching forward with full confidence along the socialist road. However, at this very moment, some bourgeois rightists, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and Chen Mingshu, are taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to loudly sing their anti-Communist, anti-socialist tunes, openly clamoring for a "political design institute," saying that the Party's leadership is a "Party-controlled world," that our socialism is a complete darkness, that everything is a mess, that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism," that the bourgeoisie is already very progressive and does not need to be reformed, and even proposing to extend fixed interest rates to twenty years, to pay the twenty years of fixed interest in one lump sum, and some are proposing to remove the public representatives from joint public-private enterprises. These various kinds of arguments are truly a miasma of noxious fumes. In addition to this, they have been creating a great deal of noise through the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily, creating an atmosphere, and dispatching reporters to ignite fires everywhere.

The Lanzhou Trip of Two Reporters

In early May, Ou Zhibei and Han Hongwen, two reporters personally assigned by Chu Anping, went to various universities in Lanzhou to "make connections." On May 16, they invited the heads of various democratic parties and senior intellectuals in Gansu to hold a "symposium." A total of twelve people attended the symposium, including Shui Zi and Yuan Jinzhang from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), Yang Shixing, Wang Jingzun, Zhu Xuanren, Liu Zhongyu, Li Huafang, and Zhou Guang from the China Democratic League, Ma Futin, Zuo Zongqi, and Liao Yanxiong from the Jiusan Society, and myself from the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA). The Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League also specially sent a comrade to provide hospitality. The purpose of the symposium, it was said, was to "help" the Communist Party in its rectification campaign. Therefore, they specially sought out some people who were "daring to speak" to talk. They specifically introduced Chu Anping as the editor-in-chief of the Guangming Daily – the newspaper of the democratic parties – and conveyed Chu Anping's "hopes," "encouraging" everyone to speak freely and boldly, and not to be afraid of making mistakes. The symposium began at 1:30 PM that day and ended at nearly 12:00 midnight. Everyone who attended the symposium spoke, and I also expressed some opinions. In the middle of the meeting, the two reporters also treated us to two tables of food. After the meeting, the two reporters summarized and organized each person's speech and sent it to the individuals for signature. This approach was indeed very thorough, but it also shows that they had a "guilty conscience." On May 26, the Guangming Daily used the entire third page, under the provocative headline "Overcome Sectarianism and Give Play to the Initiative of Intellectuals," to disclose the entire minutes of the symposium. However, at another symposium organized by the CDNCA, many comrades opposed Li Kangnian's suggestion to extend the fixed interest rate to twenty years, and I specifically talked to Han Hongwen about this, saying that this situation should be published in the newspaper. However, the Guangming Daily remained silent about this. Is this helping the Party to rectify? No, this is a conspiracy. The so-called "summary" of the Guangming Daily actually excerpted what they needed; their so-called "help" was actually to encourage rightists and some people with unstable positions to attack the Party. The twelve-person symposium they held in Lanzhou was actually igniting fires there. Soon after this symposium, rightist opinions in Lanzhou University, Lanzhou Medical College, and Northwest College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine became rampant. Some students at the Medical College even took to the streets under the instigation of rightists. Chen Shiwei, the Vice President of Lanzhou University, even took several students to Beijing to petition. This proves that the Lanzhou trip of the two reporters has exceeded the task assigned to them by Chu Anping. I heard that they were praised by Chu Anping.

I Also Made Some Erroneous Statements

I am a private industrialist and businessman, a member of the bourgeoisie. In the past seven or eight years, although my thinking has been transformed to a certain extent under the Party's cultivation and education, the transformation of class is a long-term process, and I still have a strong bourgeois consciousness. Because of this, those bourgeois arguments are particularly easy to cater to my tastes, and I am easily captured by those bourgeois careerists. What I said at the twelve-person symposium, such as "Some Party leaders look down on non-Party members, do not go to the grassroots to listen to the situation, and decide everything based solely on the reports of Party members and the Communist Youth League members," "Party members and Communist Youth League members are engaged in dealing with people, while non-Party members are engaged in business; Party members and Communist Youth League members are engaged in rectifying people, while non-Party members are being rectified," and "Some people are regarded as backward elements as long as they speak for the interests of industrialists and businessmen," were all published by the Guangming Daily as "key points." In fact, these words are all wrong. In particular, the sentence "Party members and Communist Youth League members are engaged in rectifying people, while non-Party members are being rectified," although I heard others say this, I ultimately said it myself during the symposium, and this statement certainly suited my tastes. This is a distortion of the facts, a full exposure of my bourgeois thinking. I am one of the heads of the Lanzhou organization of the CDNCA and the Gansu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. The spread of these erroneous statements will certainly have a negative impact on the industrial and commercial circles. I cannot shift the responsibility to others, and I can hardly blame the two reporters Ou and Han for seizing my words. I can only say that I still have some emotions of uneasiness about the Party's leadership and uneasiness about accepting transformation. These emotions, ignited by the two reporters Ou and Han, have been burning. This is a profound lesson for me: If the tail of the bourgeoisie is not completely cut off, it will wag at the appropriate temperature and at the appropriate time.

The Influence of Zhang Naiqi's Fallacies on Me

Now, let me talk about the influence of Zhang Naiqi's absurd statements on me.

Zhang Naiqi has many absurd statements. He once openly said that fixed interest is not exploitation, but merely "unearned income"; that the Chinese bourgeoisie is a "red bourgeoisie"; and he encouraged private representatives not to "blindly obey" the public representatives, saying that "blindly obeying" is "slavishness." When I first heard these fallacies, I thought they seemed to make sense, especially his "theory" of the red bourgeoisie. I admired and was very happy, thinking that the bourgeoisie had become "red," wasn't this more progressive? Wasn't this very good? Even in my speech, I unknowingly became infected by his poison and once expressed some sympathy and resonance with his fallacies. And on the issue of joint public-private affairs, I was always "vigilant" not to make the mistake of "slavishness." Under the control of this kind of thinking, I always felt that some public representatives were not good enough. Therefore, I did not express firm opposition to the rightists' opinions on removing public representatives. In the small group discussions and plenary speeches of this meeting, Zhang Naiqi's true face of being anti-Party and anti-socialist was thoroughly exposed, which gradually made me see through the essence of Zhang Naiqi. In particular, after further studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," my eyes were sharpened and my sense of smell was improved. I recalled that if it were not for the help of the representatives, if it were not for the teachings of Chairman Mao's report, I might have become a cheerleader for Zhang Naiqi. Here, the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie was vividly manifested in me. I am ashamed and happy for myself. Ashamed that I am progressing too slowly and my thinking is confused; happy that I have luckily not fallen into the abyss of the rightists. I deeply realize that class struggle is complex and acute. If you don't lean to the left, you will inevitably lean to the right. Real life is presenting us with questions in this way. Now, I am in great pain, and I feel even more that Premier Zhou's criticism of the rightists in his report is correct in every sentence and powerful in every word. This is the righteous voice of the Chinese people, and it has given us powerful weapons. I will resolutely draw a clear line with these rightists and fight to the end. In fact, the struggle against the rightists is a vivid ideological transformation. The ten-plus days of the National People's Congress are better than my eight years of theoretical study. However, the nature of the bourgeoisie needs long-term transformation, and the thinking of the bourgeoisie is incompatible with socialism. The bourgeoisie must undergo a "complete transformation," and I am also determined to "completely transform" myself. Recently, all the comrades of the Gansu delegation group, the industrial and commercial circles of Gansu, and the comrades of the CDNCA have criticized the erroneous remarks I once made. I sincerely thank all the comrades for their concern and help to me; I will never forget it and will always be grateful. Today, I have nothing else to say. I would like to express once again: I will unswervingly follow the Party and the working class to socialism and communism; as long as there is a breath in me, I will definitely contribute my share of strength to the cause of socialism and communism.

That's all I have to say. Please criticize and correct any errors.

    郑立斋在发言中揭露：
    光明日报记者在兰州“点火”
    周总理的政府工作报告，李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告，我都完全同意并且坚决拥护。
    中国六亿人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在取得了社会主义革命胜利的基础上，又取得了社会主义建设的辉煌成就。全国人民正在为此欢呼，正在信心百倍地沿着社会主义的大道一直前进。可是，就在这个时候，竟然有些资产阶级右派分子，如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、龙云、黄绍竑、谭惕吾、陈铭枢之流，趁着共产党整风的机会，大唱其反共、反社会主义的高调，公开叫嚣要搞什么“政治设计院”，说党的领导是“党天下”，说我们的社会主义是一团漆黑，什么都是一团糟，说“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”，资产阶级已经非常进步了，不需要改造了，甚至提出要把定息延长到二十年，要把二十年的定息一次付清，有的则提出要撤掉公私合营企业中的公方代表。这些各色各样的论调，真是乌烟瘴气、不一而足。除此而外，他们还通过光明日报、文汇报，大事喧嚷，制造气氛，并指派记者到处点火。
    两位记者的兰州之行
    五月上旬，储安平亲自指派的欧至培、韩洪文两位记者便到兰州各高等学校进行“联系”，五月十六日又邀请甘肃各民主党派负责人和高级知识分子举行了一次“座谈”。参加这次座谈会的共十二人，有民革的水梓、袁金章，民盟的杨诗兴、王景尊、朱宣人、刘钟瑜、李化方、周光，九三学社的马馥庭、左宗杞、廖延雄，民建参加的就是我。民盟甘肃省委还专门派了一位同志作招待。座谈的目的，据说是为了“帮助”共产党整风，因此，专门找一些“敢说话”的人谈一谈。他们特别介绍储安平是光明日报——各民主党派的报纸——的总编辑，并转达了储安平的“希望”，“鼓励”大家大胆地放，大胆地鸣，不要怕犯错误。座谈会于当天下午一时半开始，直到晚上将近十二点才结束。参加座谈的人都发了言，我也谈了一些意见。会议中间，两位记者还招待我们吃了两桌饭。会后，两位记者便把每人的发言加以摘要整理，并送本人签字。这种作法的确很周密，但是，恰恰从这种作法上也就可以看出他们是“作贼心虚”的。五月二十六日，光明日报以第三版的全版篇幅，用
  “克服宗派主义发挥知识分子的积极性”这样一个带有煽动性的通栏标题，把座谈的记要全部披露。可是，在民建会组织的另一次座谈会上，许多同志都反对李康年所提把定息延长二十年的意见，我曾特别同韩洪文谈过，我说应当把这一情况在报上公布。然而，光明日报却一直对此保持缄默。这难道是帮助党整风的吗？不是的，这是一个阴谋。光明日报的所谓“摘要”，实际是摘他们之所需要；他们的所谓“帮助”，实际是鼓励右派分子和一些立场不稳的人向党进攻。他们在兰州举行的这十二人座谈，实际就是在那里点火。这次座谈后不久，兰州大学、兰州医学院、西北畜牧兽医学院的右派言论就嚣张起来。医学院的部分学生一度在右派分子的煽动下上了大街。兰州大学副校长陈时伟还带了几位学生到北京请愿。这就证明，两位记者的兰州之行，已经超额完成了储安平给他们交代的任务。听说还受到储安平的表扬。
    我也发表了一些错误言论
    我是一个私营工商业者，是资产阶级的一分子。七、八年来，在党的培养教育下，我的思想虽然得到一定的改造，但是阶级的改造是长期的，我还有浓厚的资产阶级意识。正因如此，那些资产阶级的论调，也就特别容易迎合我的口胃，也就容易被那些资产阶级野心分子所俘虏。我在十二人座谈会上所说的“有些党员领导瞧不起非党员，不到基层倾听下情，光凭党团员汇报决定一切”，“党团员是搞人的，非党人士是搞业务的；党团员是整人的，非党人士是被整的”，以及“有些人只要代表工商业者的利益说话，就被目之为落后分子”等话，都被光明日报当作“要点”登了出来。实际上，这些话都是错误的。特别是“党团员是整人的，非党人士是被整的”这句话，虽然我是听别人有这种说法，但毕竟是从我口里在座谈时说了出来，这种说法当然合乎我的口胃。这是歪曲事实的说法，是我的资产阶级思想的充分暴露。我是民建会兰州组织和甘肃省工商联的负责人之一，这些错误的言论传布出去，对工商界一定是有不好影响的。我不能把责任推给别人，更难怪欧、韩两位记者抓住了我的话柄，只能说我自己思想上还有些不安于党的领导、不安于接受改造的情绪，这种情绪在欧、韩两位记者点燃之下，燃烧起来了。这对我来说是一个深刻的教训：资产阶级的尾巴如果不彻底斩掉，一遇适当的温度、适当的时机它就会翘起来。
    章乃器的谬论对我的影响
    现在，我再谈一谈章乃器的荒谬言论对我的影响。
    章乃器的荒谬言论是很多的，他曾公开的说定息不是剥削，仅仅是“不劳而获”的收入；说中国资产阶级是“红色资产阶级”；他并且鼓励私方代表不要“盲目服从”公方，“盲目服从”就是“奴才主义”。他的这些谬论，我刚一听到的时候还觉得似乎有道理，特别是对他的红色资产阶级的“理论”，我还很欣赏，很高兴，觉得资产阶级已经成了“红色”，这不是更进步了吗？不是很好吗？甚至在我的言谈中，不知不觉的中了他的毒素，并且曾经表现出对他的这种谬论有所同感和共鸣。而在公私共事问题上，我也经常“警惕”，不要犯“奴才主义”的错误。在这种思想支配之下，我也总觉得有些公方代表不行，因此，对于右派分子的撤掉公方代表的意见，也就没有表示坚决的反对。这次会议的小组讨论和大会发言中，彻底揭露了章乃器反党、反社会主义的真面目，使我逐步看透了章乃器其人的本质。特别是进一步学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告以后，擦亮了我的眼睛，提高了我的嗅觉。我回想了一下：如果不是各位代表的帮助，如果不是毛主席的报告的教导，我很可能成为章乃器的一个摇旗呐喊者。这里，资产阶级的两面性，在我身上活生生的表现了出来。我为自己惭愧，又为自己高兴。惭愧的是自己进步太慢，思想糊涂；高兴的是我侥幸没有坠入右派分子的深渊。我深深的体会到，阶级斗争是复杂的、尖锐的，你不倒向左，就必然会倒向右。实际生活就是这样给我们提出问题的。现在，我痛定思痛，更加感到周总理报告中对右派分子的批判，句句正确、字字有力。这是中国各族人民的正义声音，它给了我们以有力武器。我要坚决同这些右派分子划清界限，斗争到底。实际上，反右派的斗争，也就是一次生动的思想改造。人民代表大会十多天的会议，胜于我八年来的理论学习。但是，资产阶级的本性是需要长期改造的，资产阶级的思想是与社会主义不能相容的。资产阶级必须“脱胎换骨”的改造，我也有决心“脱胎换骨”的改造自己。最近，甘肃省代表组的全体同志、甘肃工商界和民建会的同志们，对我过去曾经说过的错误言论进行了批判。我衷心感激所有同志们对我的这种关怀和帮助；我将永世不忘、铭感肺腑。今天，我没有别的话可说，我愿意在这里再一次表示：我坚定不移地跟着党和工人阶级走向社会主义、共产主义；只要我一息尚存，我一定要为社会主义、共产主义事业贡献出我的一分力量。
    我的话就是这些，错误的地方请代表们批评指正。
