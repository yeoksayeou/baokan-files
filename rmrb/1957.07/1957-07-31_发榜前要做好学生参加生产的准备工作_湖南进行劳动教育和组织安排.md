Hunan is currently seizing the time before the announcement of exam results in schools at all levels to vigorously conduct propaganda and education on participation in labor production and organizational arrangements for primary and secondary school graduates.

Changsha, Hengyang, and seven other provincial-level cities are actively planning and arranging for urban graduates who meet certain conditions and cannot continue their education to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Most counties have listed this work as one of their current central tasks. Many places are simultaneously carrying out publicity and preparing plans for thorough investigation and arrangement. Changdian Township in Xiangxiang County investigated the production and labor needs of agricultural cooperatives, production teams, and township-run industries regarding the placement of current primary and secondary school graduates. They also investigated the students' academic performance and specialties with the schools, and the students' family economic situations and parents' hopes and requirements. According to the survey, there are fourteen junior high school graduates in the township. It is estimated that three will be able to enter schools, while nine will be placed directly in labor, concurrently serving as bookkeepers and technicians. Two will serve as teachers in people's schools. Among the ninety-seven senior primary school graduates, it is estimated that thirty will be able to enter schools, thirty-seven will engage in self-study and remedial classes, and the remaining thirty will be placed as follows: fourteen as feeders, one as an ironworker apprentice, one as a traditional Chinese medicine apprentice, one as a photographer, and the rest will be assigned to different types of labor, concurrently serving as work recorders and technicians.

In order to organize some urban graduates who meet certain conditions and cannot continue their education to go to the countryside, and to pave the way for future urban graduates to go to the countryside to engage in production, Changsha City will arrange for 500 to 1,000 people to be placed in seven counties in the Xiangtan and Changde prefectures this autumn to participate in agricultural production. Currently, Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Changde, and seven other provincial-level cities are further conducting propaganda and education among the masses and students by launching activities to raise subsidies to support urban students going to the countryside for production. Students and parents generally reflect that the Party and the government are showing them meticulous care. In some areas of Yuanjiang, Huarong, and Xiangyin counties, quotas have been fixed to specific cooperatives and lodging has been fixed to specific households for the urban students who will be arriving soon. The vast number of township and commune cadres and agricultural cooperative members have expressed a warm welcome to urban students going to the countryside.

    发榜前要做好学生参加生产的准备工作
    湖南进行劳动教育和组织安排
    本报讯　湖南各地正抓紧各级学校考试发榜前一段时间，大力进行中小学毕业生参加劳动生产的宣传教育和组织安排工作。
    长沙、衡阳等九个省辖市正在积极规划和安排一些有条件的、不能升学的城市毕业生到农村去参加农业生产。大部分县已将此项工作列为当前中心任务之一。不少地方一边宣传，一边作好了摸底安排的计划。湘乡县长甸乡对应届中小学毕业生的安置问题曾向农业社、生产队、乡属各行业调查生产及劳动力需要的情况；向学校调查毕业生的学习情况及特长；调查学生家庭经济情况及家长对子女的希望和要求。据调查，该乡有中学毕业生十四人，估计能考上学校的三人外，有九人将安置直接参加劳动，兼任记账员和技术员等工作，二人担任民校教师。在九十七名高小毕业生中，估计能考上学校的三十人，自学和复课的三十七人，其余三十人将安置作饲养员十四人，铁工学徒一人，中医学徒一人，照相一人，其余分配搞不同劳动兼任记工员技术员等工作。
    为了组织一些有条件的，不能升学的城市毕业生到农村去，为以后的城市毕业生打好一条下乡生产的出路，长沙市今年秋季将有五百人至一千人分别安置到湘潭、常德两个专区的七个县去参加农业生产。目前长沙、衡阳、湘潭，常德等九个省辖市正在通过开展筹募支援城镇学生下乡生产补助费的活动，进一步向群众和学生进行宣传教育工作。学生与学生家长普遍反映党和政府对他们关怀无微不至。沅江、华容、湘阴等县部分地方对即将下来的城市学生已将名额固定到社，寄住固定到户。广大乡社干部和农业社员对城市学生下乡表示热烈欢迎。
