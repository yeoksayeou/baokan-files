Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 11th. The "Zhejiang Daily" yesterday published an article written by He Qiongwei, exposing the fact that Zhang Naiqi incited the people to be dissatisfied with the Party and carried out counter-revolutionary activities in his hometown of Qingtian County in June last year.

The article said that Zhang Naiqi took the opportunity of inspecting work and arrived in Qingtian County on June 6th last year. As soon as he arrived, he found two people to conduct so-called interviews. These two people were: his old friend, Zhu Qiaosong, who had been the secretary of the special agent leader Dai Li and the chief of the Wenzhou Anti-Smuggling Office of the Kuomintang government, and Zhan Qiongdi (under control), the wife of Zheng Xikang, a member of the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Qingtian County Party Department (who fled to Taiwan). Since then, Zhu Qiaosong has been spreading everywhere that Zhang Naiqi is a "remarkable figure who does things for the people of Qingtian." Zhan Qiongdi became even more rampant. She openly said to the local people: "Minister Zhang has already said that you are too harsh on us. I am not afraid of your controlling me for three years. One day I will get ahead!"

The article said that Zhang Naiqi also said to Zhu Xuzhi, the principal of Wan Shan Central Elementary School: "You are young and don't know the origin of this school. This was established by Zhao Zhiyao. Zhao Zhiyao did do good things." And Zhao Zhiyao was a confidant of Chen Cheng, served as the deputy commander of the Seven Provinces Column, and the pseudo-National Defense Ministry Budget Bureau director, and was a great enemy in the minds of the people of Qingtian.

The article also said that this Minister of Food also incited dissatisfaction with the unified purchase and sale of grain among the peasants. When he met people from his hometown, he would say, "Ah! Why are you so thin! Is there not enough food to eat?" Zhang Naiqi's old neighbor, old farmer Ye Sanming, said to him, "The grain ration is neither too much nor too little, just enough to eat." Zhang Naiqi sneered and asked, "How much is your ration?" Ye Sanming replied, "An average of 435 jin per person per year, regardless of age." Zhang Naiqi also said: "I have fish and meat every meal, and I still don't have enough rice. You only eat rice, and 435 jin is not enough." At this time, the wealthy farmer Lin Chaoshui took the opportunity to ask him: "What should I do if I don't have enough to eat?" Zhang Naiqi provoked and said: You can sue to the Central Government. You should prepare the petitions and send them to the Ministry of Food in Beijing. I will find a way for you. The lazy man Ye Zaiming also complained that the production quota was too high. Farmers such as Chen Baozhu refuted him on the spot, but Zhang Naiqi insisted on supporting backward and dissatisfied opinions, saying: "The production quota is too high. It is best to sue the central government. You can also sue about the bad work style of cadres." After Zhang Naiqi left, many people did send a lot of "petitions" to this "upright official." Most of these people were landlords and counter-revolutionaries.

    浙江日报揭露章乃器又一反动活动
    粮食部长竟然唯恐粮食工作不乱
    新华社杭州11日电　“浙江日报”昨天发表了何琼玮写的一篇文章，揭露去年6月间章乃器在他的家乡青田县煽动人民对党不满，进行反动活动的事实。
    文章说，章乃器借视察工作的机会，在去年6月6日来到了青田县，一到就找到两个人进行所谓访问。这两个人是：他的老友、当过特务头子戴笠的秘书和国民党政府温州缉私处处长的朱乔松，和国民党青田县党部执行委员郑锡康（本人逃往台湾）的妻子詹琼弟（在管制中）。自此以后，朱乔松到处宣扬章乃器是“了不起的大人物，为青田人民办事。”詹琼弟更加猖狂，她公然对当地人民说：“章部长已经讲过，你们对我们太苛刻。你们管制我三年我不怕，总有一天会出头！”
    文章说，章乃器还在万山区中心小学校长朱序智的面前说：“你年轻，不知道这个学校的来历。这是赵志尧办起来的。赵志尧的确做了好事。”而赵志尧是陈诚的亲信，做过七省纵队副司令、伪国防部预算局局长，是青田人民心目中的大仇人。
    文章又说，这个粮食部长还在农民中煽动对粮食统购统销的不满。他碰见家乡人就说“啊！你们怎么这样瘦呀！是不是粮食不够吃呢？”章乃器的旧邻、老农民叶三明对他说“粮食定量不多不少、正够吃。”章乃器冷笑一声，问道：“你们定量多少？”叶三明回答说：“不分大小每人平均全年四百三十五斤。”章乃器还说：“我每餐有鱼有肉，米还不够吃，你们光吃饭，四百三十五斤是不够的。”这时富裕农民林朝水乘机问他：“不够吃怎么办？”章乃器挑拨说：可以告到中央来。你们把呈子做好，寄到北京粮食部。我来为你们想办法。懒汉叶在明这时也诉起苦来，说是定产太高。当场有农民陈宝珠等反驳他，可是章乃器却一味支持落后不满的意见，说：“定产是过高的。统统告到中央去好了。还有干部作风不好的，也可以告来。”章乃器走后，果真有人不住地向这位“青天”投了不少“呈子”。这些人多是地主、反革命分子。
