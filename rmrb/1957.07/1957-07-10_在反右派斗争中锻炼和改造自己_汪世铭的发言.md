In the past few days, I have listened to the work reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports summarized the achievements, shortcomings, and lessons learned in various aspects of our country's construction, correctly and seriously criticized the reactionary remarks of bourgeois right-wingers who opposed the Party, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship, and pointed out the correct path for our socialist revolution and socialist construction. I fully agree with and support these reports.

Now I will talk about some of my experiences and opinions in the anti-rightist struggle.

	I. The Great Significance of the Struggle Against Right-Wingers

In the short period of eight years from 1949 to the present, the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people to achieve the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution, and has also led the Chinese people to achieve brilliant achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction, and created many amazing miracles. Our country has reached unprecedented unity, and our international status has reached unprecedented heights. These achievements and miracles cannot be denied even by capitalist countries that are hostile to us. The United Nations economic report also stated that in 1956, China's industrial growth rate ranked first in the world. Can it still be said that our achievements are not the main thing? These achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the selfless and enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet Union. When I inspected Northeast China in the spring of 1956, I personally saw that many new factories were equipped with the latest and best Soviet machines, and I saw many Soviet experts working hard and selflessly to help us with construction, impart the latest technology to us, and send us the latest Soviet design drawings. This enabled us to manufacture things that we could not make ourselves in the past, and the finished products we began to manufacture could reach international standards. The Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant are prominent examples. Only those with ulterior motives can say that the Soviet Union is not good, slander the Soviet Union, and undermine Sino-Soviet unity. Historical facts over the past century have proven that taking the socialist road and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party is the only way for our country to achieve independence, freedom, prosperity, and strength. Taking the socialist road and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party are clearly stipulated in our Constitution and are the highest principles that our 600 million people jointly abide by. This is the foundation of our country and must not be allowed to be shaken in any way. In order to improve its work, strengthen its leadership, and ensure the smoother progress and development of the socialist cause, the Chinese Communist Party launched a Party rectification movement against subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and requested people from all walks of life outside the Party to offer beneficial criticisms and suggestions. Such a rectification movement promotes the broadest democracy, which is something that no country or historical era has been able to do or dared to do. This rectification movement further proves the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party and its spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Like the people of the whole country, I was greatly moved and more firmly supported socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party. However, the remaining bourgeois right-wingers and reactionaries took advantage of our exposure of contradictions among the people to launch a frenzied attack on the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. They organized and planned to spread reactionary remarks against the Party and socialism, and carried out a series of conspiracies and activities, setting fires everywhere, fearing that the world would not be in chaos, in order to prepare for usurping the leadership of the country. Most hateful of all, leading this frenzied attack and conspiracy were some responsible persons of democratic parties with high political status, such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. This cannot but arouse the unanimous anger of our people. The Party and the government gave these people high political status and great trust, wanting them to better lead the democratic parties on the socialist road and accept the leadership of the Party, but they used the political status they had obtained to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. This is truly hateful and intolerable. We members of the democratic parties must, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely fight back against these reactionary right-wingers. Only by thoroughly smashing the right-wingers' attack can we guarantee the victory of the socialist revolution and the healthy development and smooth completion of the rectification movement. The anti-rightist struggle is of great significance to the rectification movement and the socialist revolution.

	II. We Must Resolutely Carry Out the Anti-Rightist Struggle

Judging from the facts of the activities of the right-wingers exposed in the newspapers and from various sources, they are indeed organized, planned, have a program, and have a line, trying to twist us onto the capitalist road, to abolish the leadership of the Party, and to undermine the socialist revolution. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which we, the National People's Congress, unanimously passed in this solemn meeting place, absolutely cannot tolerate these reactionary right-wingers' conspiracies of sabotage. We must fight these right-wingers to the end. After all, the heads and backbones of the right-wingers still constitute a very small minority among our people. We must firmly stand our ground, in accordance with the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao in his document on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, draw a clear political and ideological line between ourselves and these right-wingers, and devote all our strength to this political struggle. We must expose as much as possible these right-wingers' reactionary activities and crimes. The right-wingers' conspiracies are extremely vicious, and they often resort to double-dealing tactics to deceive the people. After their reactionary crimes are exposed, they still say that their motives are good, but the effects and influence are not good, and even say that they are "making mistakes unintentionally, and often making mistakes." Who believes these words besides our enemies? We want to formally warn these right-wingers: the vigilance of our people has been raised, the eyes of the people are sharp, it is impossible for you to attack again, and you cannot deceive us any longer. We will fight you to the end, and we will never stop until we win. The only bright road in front of you is to turn back quickly, recognize your mistakes, and confess to the people honestly, without reservation, everything you have done, all your conspiracies, all the ugliness hidden deep in your hearts, all your secret plans and organizations, and all your secret social relationships. Only in this way can you receive lenient treatment from the people, otherwise you will be cutting yourselves off from the people, and it will no longer be a question of contradictions among the people. I would also like to suggest that the original electoral units should revoke the credentials of those right-wingers who have been exposed among the deputies to the National People's Congress. The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power and cannot allow any reactionary right-wingers to occupy it. I believe that doing so is in line with the demands of the people of the whole country and is also in line with the interests of the people of the whole country.

	III. The Necessity of Ideological Remolding of Intellectuals

Since the right-wingers have published many absurd remarks against the Party, against socialism, and against the people's democratic dictatorship, the thinking of many intellectuals, including members of democratic parties, has become confused, they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and many people have been used by these right-wingers, and their positions have become blurred. The main reason is that these intellectuals have more or less bourgeois ideological toxins in their minds. When they hear the right-wingers' remarks, their thoughts and feelings become close, and they even feel a sense of resonance. This fact shows that if the mind has not been thoroughly remolded, it is not easy to distinguish between right and wrong, the position is easy to blur, and it is easy to be used by others and led astray. This is so dangerous! People's thinking mostly lags behind the development of objective things, especially some intellectuals who come from the old society. Their minds are full of bourgeois consciousness, and it is not easy for them to accept new things. Often, society has moved forward, but their ideology is still stuck in the old stage. This requires a long period of arduous effort and struggle to be completely remolded. Our country is now in the stage of socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is inseparable from the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the First National People's Congress: "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party," and "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." This is absolutely true. The Communist Party leads the people in carrying out the socialist revolution, which is to transform the world with the working class's dialectical materialist world outlook. That is, economically, to change the private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership, and ideologically, to change the bourgeois idealist world outlook into the working class's dialectical materialist world outlook. Ideological remolding is part of the socialist revolution. Ideological remolding is more difficult than economic transformation, and it also takes longer. Based on my experience in studying at the Socialist Academy for eight or nine months, I believe that ideological remolding must be carried out from the following aspects. First, it is necessary to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism in depth and detail, to learn to master and apply the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and to gradually establish a dialectical materialist world outlook. It is necessary to deeply criticize bourgeois ideology. The core of bourgeois ideology is idealism, which is mainly manifested in subjectivism, individualism, departmentalism, detachment from reality, detachment from the masses, and detachment from class struggle. To learn Marxist-Leninist theory well, we must dig these things out of our minds, that is, we must first negate ourselves, clear obstacles for new ideas, and pave the way. If we do not do this, the old world outlook is not easy to change, and the new world outlook is not easy to establish. Second, we must test and temper ourselves in life practice and class struggle. For example, in this anti-rightist struggle, we should examine whether our own thoughts and feelings are close to those of the right-wingers, whether we can immediately and correctly distinguish between right and wrong, and whether our position has wavered. We must use the position, viewpoint, and method of dialectical materialism to analyze and criticize the remarks of the right-wingers, improve our political sense of smell, and wage a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the right-wingers. The process of the anti-rightist struggle is the process of ideological remolding. We must further remold our thinking in the anti-rightist struggle. Third, we must get close to the working class, peasants, and laboring masses and establish ideological feelings. It is best to live in the countryside or factories for a certain amount of time each year, and participate in industrial and agricultural production labor as much as possible. This is a very good direction for efforts to remold our thinking. In short, to build socialism, ideological remolding and the change of world outlook are necessary. The more thorough the ideological remolding, the firmer the position will be. The process of ideological remolding is the process of position transformation. Ideological remolding is not an easy task. By working hard from the three aspects mentioned above, I believe that thinking can be remolded and a dialectical materialist world outlook can be established. We must firmly stand our ground and persist in the anti-rightist struggle. We must temper ourselves and remold ourselves in the anti-rightist struggle. The victory of the anti-rightist struggle is the victory of the socialist revolution. With the leadership of the Communist Party, we will surely be able to achieve victory.

    在反右派斗争中锻炼和改造自己
    汪世铭的发言
    这几天，我听到了周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、董必武院长、张鼎丞检察长、彭真副委员长各项工作报告。这些报告总结了我国各方面建设工作中的成绩、缺点和经验教训，正确地、严肃地批判了资产阶级右派分子反党、反社会主义、反人民民主专政制度的反动言论，指出了我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设前进的正确道路。我对这些报告完全同意和拥护。
    我现在谈一谈我在反右派斗争中一些体会和意见。
      一、反右派分子斗争的伟大意义
    自一九四九年到现在短短的八年时期中，中国共产党领导中国人民取得了新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，又领导中国人民在政治、经济、文化建设各方面取得了辉煌的成就，并创造许许多多惊人的奇迹。我们的国家达到空前的统一，我们的国际地位达到空前的提高。这些成就和奇迹，就是敌视我们的资本主义国家也不能不承认。联合国经济报告中也说，一九五六年我国工业增长速度占世界第一。还能说我们的成绩不是主要的吗？这些成绩是与共产党的领导，社会主义制度分不开的，也是与苏联大公无私的热诚援助分不开的。我一九五六年春季到东北视察，亲眼看到许多新型工厂都装备着苏联最新最好的机器，看见许多苏联专家正在辛勤忘我地帮助我们建设，传授给我们最新技术，同时把苏联最新的设计图样送给我们，这就使我们以往不能自己制的东西，都能制造出来了，并且开始制造出来的成品就能达到国际水平。长春第一汽车制造厂和哈尔滨量具刃具厂就是显著的例子。只有别有用心的人才能说苏联不好，诋毁苏联，破坏中苏团结。百年来历史事实证明了走社会主义道路，接受共产党的领导，是我们国家走向独立、自由、繁荣、富强的唯一道路。走社会主义道路，接受共产党的领导，我们的宪法中已有明文规定，是我们六亿人民所共同遵守的最高原则，这是我们的国本，绝不能容许有任何动摇。中国共产党为了改进工作，加强领导，保证社会主义事业更顺利地进行和发展，开展了反主观主义、反官僚主义、反宗派主义的党内整风运动，要求各方面党外人士提出有益的批评和建议。这样的整风运动发扬了最广泛的民主，是任何国家、任何历史时代所做不到的事，所不敢做的事。这一整风运动更证明了中国共产党的伟大和诚心诚意为人民服务的精神。我同全国人民一样受到极大的感动，更坚决地拥护社会主义、拥护共产党的领导。但是残余的资产阶级右派分子和反动分子就利用我们揭发人民内部矛盾的时候，乘机向社会主义道路，向党的领导发动猖狂进攻，有组织地、有计划地散布反党、反社会主义的反动言论，并进行一系列的阴谋活动，到处点火，惟恐天下不乱，为篡夺国家领导权作准备。最可痛恨的，领导这一猖狂进攻阴谋活动的是一些有很高政治地位的民主党派负责人，如章伯钧、罗隆基之流。这就不能不引起我全国人民一致的愤怒。党和政府给予这些人很高的政治地位和很大的信任，是要他们更好地领导各民主党派走社会主义道路，接受党的领导，但他们反利用所得到的政治地位来进行反党、反社会主义的勾当，这真是令人痛恨，令人不能容忍。我们民主党派成员一定要与全国人民一道对这些反动的右派分子予以坚强的回击。只有彻底粉碎右派分子的进攻，才能保证社会主义革命的胜利，才能保证整风运动的健康发展和顺利完成。反右派斗争对整风运动、对社会主义革命是有重大意义的。
      二、要坚决地进行反右派的斗争
    从报纸上和各方面所揭露出来的右派分子的活动事实来看，他们的确是有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线，想把我们扭向资本主义道路，要取消党的领导，破坏社会主义革命。我们全国人民代表在这个庄严的会场上所一致通过的中华人民共和国宪法是绝不能容忍这些反动的右派分子阴谋破坏的，我们要与这些右派分子斗争到底。右派分子首脑和骨干在我们全国人民中毕竟还是占极少数，我们一定要根据毛主席在正确处理人民内部矛盾的文件中所指示的六项政治标准，站稳立场，与这些右派分子划清政治界限和思想界限，并把全副力量投入这一场政治斗争中。我们要尽量揭露这些右派分子的反动活动和罪行。右派分子的阴谋是非常毒辣的，他们常耍两面派的手法来欺骗人民。在他们的反动罪行被揭发后，他们还说，他们的动机是好的，只是效果和影响不好，甚至说，他们是“无心犯错、常犯错”。这些话，除我们敌人外还有什么人相信？我们要正式警告这些右派分子：我们全国人民的警惕性都已提高了，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，你们再想进攻是不可能的，你们再想欺骗，是欺骗不了的。我们要与你们斗争到底，不胜利，决不收兵。摆在你们面前的唯一光明道路，就是赶快回头，认识错误，把你们一切活动阴谋，把藏在你们心灵深处的一切丑恶，把你们的秘密计划、组织，把你们的一切秘密社会关系，赤裸裸地、老老实实地、毫不保留地向人民认真交代，彻底坦白。只有这样才能得到人民的宽大处理，否则就是自绝于人民了，也就不是人民内部矛盾问题了。我还要建议：凡是全国人民代表大会代表中已暴露出来的右派分子，原选举单位应当撤销他们的代表资格。全国人民代表大会是全国最高权力机关，不能让任何反动的右派分子盘踞在内。我认为这样做，是符合全国人民要求的，也是符合全国人民利益的。
      三、知识分子思想改造的必要性
    自从右派分子发表许多反党、反社会主义、反人民民主专政制度的荒谬言论以来，不少知识分子包括民主党派成员在内，思想发生混乱，是非不能辨别，也有不少人被这些右派分子利用，立场模糊起来。主要原因是这些知识分子头脑中或多或少存在着资产阶级思想毒素，一听到右派分子的言论，思想感情就接近起来，甚至有共鸣之感。这一事实说明了思想没有得到彻底改造，是非就不易辨别，立场就容易模糊，也很容易被人利用，引入歧途，这是多么危险呵！人们的思想多半落后于客观事物的发展，尤其是从旧社会来的一些知识分子，头脑中充满了资产阶级意识，不容易接受新鲜事物，往往社会向前进步了，而思想意识还停留在旧的阶段上。这需要经过长时期艰苦的努力和斗争才能彻底改造过来。我国现处在社会主义革命阶段，社会主义革命与马克思列宁主义思想的领导是分不开的。毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会的开幕词中说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党”，“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”。这是千真万确的真理。共产党领导人民进行社会主义革命，就是要用工人阶级辩证唯物主义世界观改造世界，这就是在经济上要把生产资料私有制改变为社会主义公有制，在思想意识上要把资产阶级唯心主义世界观改变为工人阶级辩证唯物主义世界观。思想改造是社会主义革命一部分。思想改造比经济改造要难些，时间也要长些。根据我在社会主义学院八九个月来学习的体会，我认为思想改造必须从以下各方面努力。第一，要深入细致地学习马克思、列宁主义的理论，要学习掌握和运用马克思、列宁主义的立场、观点、方法，逐渐建立辩证唯物主义世界观。要深刻地对资产阶级思想进行批判。资产阶级思想的核心就是唯心主义，主要表现在主观主义、个人主义、本位主义、脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离阶级斗争。要学好马克思、列宁主义理论，就必须把这些东西从我们脑海中挖除出去，这就是必须先否定自己，为新的思想扫除障碍，开辟道路。不这样做，旧世界观是不容易改变的，新世界观是不容易建立的。第二，要在生活实践和阶级斗争中考验自己，锻炼自己。例如在这次反右派斗争中我们就应当检查我们自己思想感情有没有与右派分子接近的地方，是非能不能立刻正确辨别，立场有没有动摇。我们要运用辩证唯物主义的立场、观点、方法来分析批判右派分子的言论，提高我们的政治嗅觉，并与右派分子作坚决不调和的斗争。反右派斗争的过程就是思想改造的过程。我们要在反右派斗争中进一步改造我们的思想。第三，要与工农劳动大众接近，建立思想感情。最好每年能有一定时间住在农村或工厂，尽可能地参加工农生产劳动。这是改造思想一个很好的努力方向。总之要建设社会主义，思想的改造，世界观的改变是必要的。思想改造越彻底，立场就越站得稳。思想改造的过程就是立场转变的过程。思想改造不是一件容易的事，从以上所说的三方面努力，我相信思想是可以改造过来的，辩证唯物主义世界观是可以建立起来的。我们一定要站稳立场，坚持反右派的斗争。我们要从反右派斗争中锻炼自己、改造自己。反右派斗争的胜利就是社会主义革命的胜利。我们有共产党的领导，我们一定能够得到胜利。
