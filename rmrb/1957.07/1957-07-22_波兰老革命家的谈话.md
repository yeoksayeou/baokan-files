    A Conversation with a Polish Veteran Revolutionary
    By Our Correspondent, Hu Sisheng
    This year's May Day in Warsaw was unforgettable. When I think of it, the heart-stirring melody of "The Internationale" rings in my ears, and the old revolutionary fighters who marched at the head of the parade, chests out, appear before my eyes, accompanied by that majestic song. That day, these veteran warriors walked at the forefront of the parade, and the wrinkles on their faces and the silver hair on their heads seemed to do nothing to diminish the strength of their steps. They marched arm in arm, looking solemnly ahead. Everyone who understands the history of the Polish people's long struggle for freedom and liberation can somewhat appreciate the feelings of these warriors who dedicated their youth to their country and to socialism.
    Ever since then, the hope of meeting and talking with these "old revolutionaries" in person has constantly surged within me.
    As the National Day of the Polish People's Republic drew nearer, thanks to the arrangement of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, my hope was fulfilled.
    First Conversation
    One sweltering noon, we met Comrade Fiedkiewicz, aged seventy-one, at the Party History Institute of the Polish United Workers' Party. Comrade Fiedkiewicz was wearing a slightly old navy blue suit. Although not tall, he was full of vigor. He is currently mainly engaged in writing memoirs. Therefore, when we expressed our request, he lit a cigarette, and his speech took us to a distant past...
      "I became associated with the socialist movement a long time ago. In 1904, I went to the United States. During my years in the United States, I worked in coal mines and textile factories, and at the same time, I 'worked and studied' with the money I earned with my own sweat. During that period, I was not only an active participant in the workers' strikes there, but also participated in the American communist movement between 1918 and 1919." He simply summarized his youthful life in exile abroad.
    After returning to Poland, Fiedkiewicz joined the then Independent Peasants' Party and became a member of that party in the parliament. The Independent Peasants' Party was then an organization influenced by the Polish Communist Party. Its main masses were poor peasants, and it advocated the alliance of workers and peasants, recognized the leadership of the working class, and cooperated with the Communist Party, which was then underground. In 1925, members of this party in parliament formed a communist group in parliament together with communist members, and Fiedkiewicz was also a member of this group. One of the main goals of this group's struggle in parliament was to fight for land reform. Because the land issue was very serious in Poland at that time, three-quarters of the country's land was concentrated in the hands of landlords, and the revolutionary nature of the peasant masses was also very high. In 1926, waves of workers' strikes and demonstrations also surged, and the rulers took high-pressure measures. In 1927, the Independent Peasants' Party was declared illegal and forced to go underground, and Fiedkiewicz was also arrested.
    "At that time, the fascist white terror was intensifying day by day. The police were arresting people everywhere. Progressive elements were shot. Before the parliamentary elections of 1926, candidates from progressive parties were arrested in batches. The number of communists and progressives in parliament decreased day by day. The fascist regime also implemented a 'kill all, burn all, loot all' policy in the Ukrainian and Belarusian minority areas, just like the Japanese did in China." Fiedkiewicz described to us the suffering of the people at that time. "However, communists and revolutionaries were not intimidated. We still organized strikes, organized May Day parades, and boycotted the so-called 'elections.' For example, in the 1935 elections, as a result of our boycott, only 46% of the people participated in the elections. This continued until Hitler occupied Poland."
    The German occupation not only deepened the difficulties of the struggle, but also made the struggle situation more complicated. However, communists and progressive elements still organized themselves. At that time, fighting organizations such as "Friends of the Soviet Union," "Hammer and Sickle," and "Proletarian" emerged. Fiedkiewicz participated in "Proletarian." In 1942, the Polish Workers' Party was established, and most members of these organizations joined the Polish Workers' Party. Fiedkiewicz also joined and actively participated in various underground struggles. In June 1943, Fiedkiewicz was arrested by the German secret police and imprisoned in the most horrifying Auschwitz concentration camp.
    At this time, he handed us a book with a grim barbed wire fence on the cover, and said, "I will give you this book. This is my memoir about the Auschwitz concentration camp. After reading it, you will probably be terrified, but this is not the whole truth."
    Fiedkiewicz rarely talked about himself, so we asked him to talk about his struggle at that time.
    "Okay! I'll give you a fact," he nodded and said, "At that time, under the German reign of terror, we were all organized in batches. I lived in Milan√≥wek, a suburb of Warsaw. To cover up our activities, I opened a private clinic there. This was a clinic in name only, and was actually a place where communists held secret meetings and set up radio stations. In the outer room were real patients, and in the inner room slept the central leaders of the Polish Workers' Party at that time. For example, the first secretary of the party at that time, Nowotko, was hidden in my house."
    Perhaps due to modesty, Fiedkiewicz still refused to talk more about himself. Therefore, we turned to another topic. Since Comrade Fiedkiewicz had lived and struggled under the old system for more than fifty years, we asked him to talk about the achievements made in the short ten years since the establishment of the Polish People's Republic by comparing the old and the new.
    "Without a doubt, there is a big difference between these two periods. The people's regime has solved problems that the old Poland could not solve, such as land reform. Although we made mistakes in the land issue after liberation due to our lack of experience, these mistakes have been corrected. However, even if we made some mistakes, farmers can now wear leather shoes and make clothes, which was not possible before liberation; they can now eat meat, which was not always possible before." He paused and then continued: "As for the workers, although some people still have opinions about the people's regime because the people's regime cannot yet fully meet their material needs, there is a world of difference compared with before liberation. Before liberation, most workers could only eat potatoes and a little oil, and some people even went hungry, while today, Poland has eliminated hunger, and the food workers eat today is at least no worse than that of intellectuals."
    When he shook hands with us to say goodbye, this veteran of the workers' movement said, as if concluding, "Any path that leads to socialism is good."
    Second Conversation
    A few days later, we met with the female revolutionary fighter, Comrade Stzelecka. Her current administrative position is Deputy Minister of Supervision and is one of Poland's three female deputy ministers.
    Comrade Stzelecka was wearing summer clothes and had dark skin, as if she had just returned from a vacation somewhere. At the beginning of the conversation, she recalled the scene of the underground struggle before liberation...
      "At that time, the struggle, which was both dangerous and difficult in a precarious situation, mainly relied on the party's unity and discipline. At that time, the comrades in the party were really like a family. There was no distance between superiors and subordinates. Everyone cared for each other and helped each other. The situation of sincere unity and mutual help among comrades at that time will never be forgotten. In addition, everyone's discipline was very strong at that time. This is also understandable because the comrades who joined the party at that time gave their lives to the party."
    Comrade Stzelecka joined the party underground in 1942 when the Polish Workers' Party was established. After joining the party, she actively participated in the work of building the party in factories. Then, she participated in the work of the party establishing the People's Army from worker party members. At that time, one of the main tasks of the People's Army was to sabotage the military transportation lines of the Hitler army to the Soviet Union in order to cooperate with the Soviet army's counteroffensive. In 1944, she worked in the underground headquarters of the People's Army in Warsaw, making documents, printing documents, making hand grenades, and helping the wounded and sick escape. She did everything. On the eve of the Soviet army approaching Warsaw, she and her party comrades participated in the Warsaw Uprising. After the uprising failed, they escaped from the underground sewers, but were arrested by the Germans due to the betrayal of a traitor. At this dangerous moment, due to the approach of the Soviet army, the German guards knew that all was lost, and the comrades bribed them to rescue her.
      "I may be lucky to be alive now. Perhaps only five percent of the comrades who struggled underground at that time are still alive." When she said this, her voice became low and serious.
    After liberation, Comrade Stzelecka participated in socialist construction with the greatest enthusiasm. She later worked in youth work, cooperative work, and up to the current supervisory work. Having participated in the struggle before liberation and the construction after liberation, Comrade Stzelecka said: "I now increasingly feel that building socialism is more difficult and more complex than gaining people's power. In the past, workers supported our struggle, and everyone was for socialism because the painful life at that time made people yearn for socialism. People thought that everything would be fine when socialism came, that there would be meat if they wanted meat, bread if they wanted bread, and their requirements could be met. But real life shows that socialism cannot make everyone's life perfect overnight, so some people seem impatient and lack confidence."
    "But, you have to think about the past life," she continued: "Take my family as an example. Before liberation, my father was a construction worker. Every spring, because the workers had nothing to eat, they always started with a strike, and my father was the organizer of the strike. Among the children of thousands of construction workers, only I went to school because I was the youngest, and my three older brothers all worked and could help me a little. But what about now after liberation?" She did not continue because the fact that tens of thousands of workers' children are going to college is in front of us.
    Stzelecka's remarks are educational. Because only those who have tasted pain can more deeply appreciate the happiness that is growing and its meaning.
