    A Conversation with a Polish Veteran Revolutionary
    By Our Correspondent, Hu Sisheng
    This year's May Day in Warsaw was unforgettable. When I think of it, the heart-stirring melody of "The Internationale" rings in my ears, and the old revolutionary fighters who marched at the head of the parade, chests out, appear before my eyes, accompanied by that majestic song. That day, these veteran warriors walked at the forefront of the parade, and the wrinkles on their faces and the silver hair on their heads seemed to do nothing to diminish the strength of their steps. They marched arm in arm, looking solemnly ahead. Everyone who understands the history of the Polish people's long struggle for freedom and liberation can somewhat appreciate the feelings of these warriors who dedicated their youth to their country and to socialism.
    Ever since then, the hope of meeting and talking with these "old revolutionaries" in person has constantly surged within me.
    As the National Day of the Polish People's Republic drew nearer, thanks to the arrangement of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, my hope was fulfilled.
    First Conversation
    One sweltering noon, we met Comrade Fiedkiewicz, aged seventy-one, at the Party History Institute of the Polish United Workers' Party. Comrade Fiedkiewicz was wearing a slightly old navy blue suit. Although not tall, he was full of vigor. He is currently mainly engaged in writing memoirs. Therefore, when we expressed our request, he lit a cigarette, and his speech took us to a distant past...
      "I became associated with the socialist movement a long time ago. In 1904, I went to the United States. During my years in the United States, I worked in coal mines and textile factories, and at the same time, I 'worked and studied' with the money I earned with my own sweat. During that period, I was not only an active participant in the workers' strikes there, but also participated in the American communist movement between 1918 and 1919." He simply summarized his youthful life in exile abroad.
    After returning to Poland, Fiedkiewicz joined the then Independent Peasants' Party and became a member of that party in the parliament. The Independent Peasants' Party was then an organization influenced by the Polish Communist Party. Its main masses were poor peasants, and it advocated the alliance of workers and peasants, recognized the leadership of the working class, and cooperated with the Communist Party, which was then underground. In 1925, members of this party in parliament formed a communist group in parliament together with communist members, and Fiedkiewicz was also a member of this group. One of the main goals of this group's struggle in parliament was to fight for land reform. Because the land issue was very serious in Poland at that time, three-quarters of the country's land was concentrated in the hands of landlords, and the revolutionary nature of the peasant masses was also very high. In 1926, waves of workers' strikes and demonstrations also surged, and the rulers took high-pressure measures. In 1927, the Independent Peasants' Party was declared illegal and forced to go underground, and Fiedkiewicz was also arrested.
    "At that time, the fascist white terror was intensifying day by day. The police were arresting people everywhere. Progressive elements were shot. Before the parliamentary elections of 1926, candidates from progressive parties were arrested in batches. The number of communists and progressives in parliament decreased day by day. The fascist regime also implemented a 'kill all, burn all, loot all' policy in the Ukrainian and Belarusian minority areas, just like the Japanese did in China." Fiedkiewicz described to us the suffering of the people at that time. "However, communists and revolutionaries were not intimidated. We still organized strikes, organized May Day parades, and boycotted the so-called 'elections.' For example, in the 1935 elections, as a result of our boycott, only 46% of the people participated in the elections. This continued until Hitler occupied Poland."
    The German occupation not only deepened the difficulties of the struggle, but also made the struggle situation more complicated. However, communists and progressive elements still organized themselves. At that time, fighting organizations such as "Friends of the Soviet Union," "Hammer and Sickle," and "Proletarian" emerged. Fiedkiewicz participated in "Proletarian." In 1942, the Polish Workers' Party was established, and most members of these organizations joined the Polish Workers' Party. Fiedkiewicz also joined and actively participated in various underground struggles. In June 1943, Fiedkiewicz was arrested by the German secret police and imprisoned in the most horrifying Auschwitz concentration camp.
    At this time, he handed us a book with a grim barbed wire fence on the cover, and said, "I will give you this book. This is my memoir about the Auschwitz concentration camp. After reading it, you will probably be terrified, but this is not the whole truth."
    Fiedkiewicz rarely talked about himself, so we asked him to talk about his struggle at that time.
    "Okay! I'll give you a fact," he nodded and said, "At that time, under the German reign of terror, we were all organized in batches. I lived in Milanówek, a suburb of Warsaw. To cover up our activities, I opened a private clinic there. This was a clinic in name only, and was actually a place where communists held secret meetings and set up radio stations. In the outer room were real patients, and in the inner room slept the central leaders of the Polish Workers' Party at that time. For example, the first secretary of the party at that time, Nowotko, was hidden in my house."
    Perhaps due to modesty, Fiedkiewicz still refused to talk more about himself. Therefore, we turned to another topic. Since Comrade Fiedkiewicz had lived and struggled under the old system for more than fifty years, we asked him to talk about the achievements made in the short ten years since the establishment of the Polish People's Republic by comparing the old and the new.
    "Without a doubt, there is a big difference between these two periods. The people's regime has solved problems that the old Poland could not solve, such as land reform. Although we made mistakes in the land issue after liberation due to our lack of experience, these mistakes have been corrected. However, even if we made some mistakes, farmers can now wear leather shoes and make clothes, which was not possible before liberation; they can now eat meat, which was not always possible before." He paused and then continued: "As for the workers, although some people still have opinions about the people's regime because the people's regime cannot yet fully meet their material needs, there is a world of difference compared with before liberation. Before liberation, most workers could only eat potatoes and a little oil, and some people even went hungry, while today, Poland has eliminated hunger, and the food workers eat today is at least no worse than that of intellectuals."
    When he shook hands with us to say goodbye, this veteran of the workers' movement said, as if concluding, "Any path that leads to socialism is good."
    Second Conversation
    A few days later, we met with the female revolutionary fighter, Comrade Stzelecka. Her current administrative position is Deputy Minister of Supervision and is one of Poland's three female deputy ministers.
    Comrade Stzelecka was wearing summer clothes and had dark skin, as if she had just returned from a vacation somewhere. At the beginning of the conversation, she recalled the scene of the underground struggle before liberation...
      "At that time, the struggle, which was both dangerous and difficult in a precarious situation, mainly relied on the party's unity and discipline. At that time, the comrades in the party were really like a family. There was no distance between superiors and subordinates. Everyone cared for each other and helped each other. The situation of sincere unity and mutual help among comrades at that time will never be forgotten. In addition, everyone's discipline was very strong at that time. This is also understandable because the comrades who joined the party at that time gave their lives to the party."
    Comrade Stzelecka joined the party underground in 1942 when the Polish Workers' Party was established. After joining the party, she actively participated in the work of building the party in factories. Then, she participated in the work of the party establishing the People's Army from worker party members. At that time, one of the main tasks of the People's Army was to sabotage the military transportation lines of the Hitler army to the Soviet Union in order to cooperate with the Soviet army's counteroffensive. In 1944, she worked in the underground headquarters of the People's Army in Warsaw, making documents, printing documents, making hand grenades, and helping the wounded and sick escape. She did everything. On the eve of the Soviet army approaching Warsaw, she and her party comrades participated in the Warsaw Uprising. After the uprising failed, they escaped from the underground sewers, but were arrested by the Germans due to the betrayal of a traitor. At this dangerous moment, due to the approach of the Soviet army, the German guards knew that all was lost, and the comrades bribed them to rescue her.
      "I may be lucky to be alive now. Perhaps only five percent of the comrades who struggled underground at that time are still alive." When she said this, her voice became low and serious.
    After liberation, Comrade Stzelecka participated in socialist construction with the greatest enthusiasm. She later worked in youth work, cooperative work, and up to the current supervisory work. Having participated in the struggle before liberation and the construction after liberation, Comrade Stzelecka said: "I now increasingly feel that building socialism is more difficult and more complex than gaining people's power. In the past, workers supported our struggle, and everyone was for socialism because the painful life at that time made people yearn for socialism. People thought that everything would be fine when socialism came, that there would be meat if they wanted meat, bread if they wanted bread, and their requirements could be met. But real life shows that socialism cannot make everyone's life perfect overnight, so some people seem impatient and lack confidence."
    "But, you have to think about the past life," she continued: "Take my family as an example. Before liberation, my father was a construction worker. Every spring, because the workers had nothing to eat, they always started with a strike, and my father was the organizer of the strike. Among the children of thousands of construction workers, only I went to school because I was the youngest, and my three older brothers all worked and could help me a little. But what about now after liberation?" She did not continue because the fact that tens of thousands of workers' children are going to college is in front of us.
    Stzelecka's remarks are educational. Because only those who have tasted pain can more deeply appreciate the happiness that is growing and its meaning.

    波兰老革命家的谈话
    本报记者　胡思升
    今年华沙的“五一”是令人难忘的。一想起它，我的耳际就响起了“国际歌”的扣人心弦的旋律，在我的眼前浮现出伴着那雄壮的歌声挺胸前进的老革命战士。那一天，这些老战士走在游行队伍的最前列，他们脸上的皱纹和头上的银发仿佛一点也没有减弱他们步伐的坚强有力，他们手挽着手，严肃地望着道路的前方。每个了解波兰人民为了争取自由和解放的漫长斗争的历史的人，都可以多少体会到这些把青春献给了祖国和社会主义的战士们的心情。
    怎样能亲自同这些“老革命”见面谈谈，从那时起就成为经常冲激着我的一个希望。
    在波兰人民共和国国庆节日益迫近的时候，感谢波兰统一工人党中央的安排，我的希望得到了满足。
    第一次谈话
    一个盛暑的中午，我们在波兰统一工人党党史研究所里会见了七十一岁高龄的弗德凯维兹同志。弗德凯维兹同志穿着一身藏青色的半旧的西装，身材虽不高，但精神抖擞。他现在主要从事写回忆录的工作。因此，当我们谈出我们的要求时，他点起了一支烟，他的讲话把我们带到了相当远的过去……
      “我同社会主义运动接近是很早以前的事了。1904年我去美国，在美国的几年中，曾在煤矿、纺织厂中做过工作，同时用自己的血汗换来的钱‘半工半读’。在那段时期，我不仅是那里工人罢工的积极分子，而且参加了1918—1919年间的美国共产主义运动。”他简单地概括了一下他青年时代流亡国外的生活。
    弗德凯维兹回国后，就参加了那时的独立农民党，并成为那个党在议会的议员。独立农民党那时是在波兰共产党影响下的组织，主要的群众是贫农，这个党主张工农联盟并承认工人阶级的领导，并与当时处在地下状态的共产党合作。1925年，这个党的议员同共产党议员一起在议会成立了共产主义小组，弗德凯维兹也是这个小组的成员之一。这个小组在议会中斗争的主要目标之一是争取土地改革。因为土地问题那时在波兰十分严重，全国四分之三的土地都集中在地主手里，农民群众的革命性也很高涨。1926年，工人罢工示威运动也风起云涌，统治者采取高压措施。1927年，独立农民党被宣布非法，被迫转入地下，弗德凯维兹也被捕了。
    “那时法西斯白色恐怖一天甚于一天，警察到处抓人捕人。枪杀进步分子，1926年议会选举前夕，进步党派的候选人成批被逮捕，共产党员和进步人士在议会的人数日益减少，法西斯政权并在乌克兰人和白俄罗斯人的少数民族地区实行像日本人在中国实行的‘三光政策’。”弗德凯维兹向我们描绘了那时人民痛苦的状况，“但是，共产党员和革命者没有被吓倒，我们依然组织罢工。组织‘五一’游行。抵制所谓‘选举’，像1935年的选举，由于我们抵制的结果，只有46％的人参加了选举。这样一直到希特勒占领波兰为止。”
    德国的占领不仅加深了斗争的困难，斗争形势就更形成复杂了。但是，共产党员和进步分子仍然自己组织起来，那时出现了像“苏联之友”、“锤子与镰刀”、“无产者”等斗争组织。弗德凯维兹参加了“无产者”。1942年波兰工人党成立，这些组织的大部成员都加入波兰工人党，弗德凯维兹也加入了，并积极地参加了各种地下斗争。1943年6月，弗德凯维兹被德国秘密警察逮捕，并被关进最骇人听闻的奥斯维辛集中营。
    这时，他递给我们一本书，书的封面上是阴森的铁丝网，他说“我把这本书送给你们，这是我写的关于在奥斯维辛集中营的回忆录，你们看了以后，恐怕会毛骨悚然，但这还不是全部的事实。”
    弗德凯维兹很少谈自己，于是我们请他谈谈自己那时斗争的情况。
    “好吧！我举一件事实”他点点头说，“那时在德国的恐怖统治下，我们都分批组织起来，我那时住在华沙郊外的米莱诺维克，为了掩护活动起见，在那里我开了个私人诊疗所，这是个名义上的诊疗所，实际上是共产党员秘密集会和设立电台之处。外面一间房子里是真正的病号，在里面一间就睡了那时波兰工人党的中央领导人，像那时党的第一书记诺伏特科就掩护在我家里。”
    可能是由于谦逊，弗德凯维兹仍然不肯多谈自己。于是，我们转向了另一个题目。既然弗德凯维兹同志在旧制度下生活和斗争了五十多年，我们请他通过新旧的对比来谈谈在波兰人民共和国成立以来短短的十几年所取得的成就。
    “毫无疑问，这两个时期有很大的区别。人民政权解决了以前旧波兰所无法解决的问题，像土地改革就是。虽然解放后由于我们缺乏经验，所以在土地问题上也犯过错误，这些错误已在纠正。但是，即使犯了某些错误，现在农民都可以穿皮鞋，做衣服了，而解放前就做不到；现在都可以吃肉了，而以前也不能全部做到。”他顿了一顿又接着说：“至于工人，虽然现在还有人对人民政权有意见，因为人民政权现在还不能完全满足他们的物质要求，但同解放前比起来真有天壤之别。解放前，大部分工人只能吃土豆和一点点油，而且还有人饿肚子，而在今天，波兰已经消灭了饥饿现象，而且今天工人吃的也至少不比知识分子差。”
    在同我们握别的时候，这位工人运动的老战士像作结论似地说：“凡是走向社会主义的道路，都是好的。”
    第二次谈话
    过了几天，我们又会见了女革命战士斯捷莱茨卡同志，她现在的行政职务是监察部副部长，是波兰的三个女副部长之一。
    斯捷莱茨卡同志穿着夏装，皮肤黝黑，如像刚从什么地方休假回来。谈话一开始她就回忆起解放前地下斗争的情景来……
      “那时在朝不保夕的既危险又困难的情况下斗争，主要靠党的团结和纪律。在那个时候，党内同志的确像一家人一样，上下级彼此间毫无距离，大家互相关心，互相帮助。那时同志之间真诚团结互相帮助的情况是永远不会使人忘怀的。此外，那时大家的纪律性非常强。这也是可以理解的，因为那时入党的同志都是把生命交给党的。”
    斯捷莱茨卡同志在1942年波兰工人党成立时就在地下入党了，她在地下的名字叫马尔塔。入党以后，就积极参加工厂的建党工作。接着，又参加了党从工人党员中建立人民军的工作。那时人民军的主要任务之一是破坏希特勒军队开往苏联的军用交通线，以配合苏军反攻。1944年，她隐蔽在华沙人民军地下总部工作，制造证件，印刷文件，制造手榴弹，掩护伤病员逃走，什么工作都做。在苏军迫近华沙前夕，又同党的同志一起参加华沙起义，起义失败后，从地下水道逃出来，但由于叛徒的出卖，被德国人逮捕。在这危险的时刻，由于苏军迫近，德国看守知道大势已去，同志们就用贿赂的办法把她救出来。
      “我活到现在也许是侥幸的，那时在地下斗争的同志恐怕只有百分之五的人现在还活着。”她说到这里声音显得低沉严肃起来了。
    解放以后，斯捷莱茨卡同志又以最大的热情参加社会主义建设工作，她以后做过青年工作，合作社工作，一直到现在的监察工作。既参加了解放前的斗争，又参加了解放后的建设，斯捷莱茨卡同志说：“我现在越来越感觉到，建设社会主义比取得人民政权更艰难更复杂。以前工人都支持我们的斗争，大家都为社会主义，因为那时痛苦生活使人们向往着社会主义。人们想，到了社会主义，一切都好了，要肉有肉，要面包有面包，要求可以满足了。但现实生活说明，社会主义并不能一夜之间就把大家的生活变得完美无缺，于是有人就显得耐心不够和信心不足了。”
    “但是，要想想以前的生活”她接着说下去：“拿我的一家来做例。解放前，我的父亲是建筑工人，每年春天，由于工人们没有吃的，总是以罢工开始，我的父亲就是罢工的组织者。在几千个建筑工人的孩子中，只有我一个人上过学，因为我是最小的，我的三个哥哥都作工作，多少能接济我一些。但解放后的现在呢？”她没有说下去，因为成千成万工人子弟上大学的事实就摆在面前。
    斯捷莱茨卡的一段话是有教育意义的。因为只有尝过痛苦的人，才会更深地体会到正在成长着的幸福和它的含意。
