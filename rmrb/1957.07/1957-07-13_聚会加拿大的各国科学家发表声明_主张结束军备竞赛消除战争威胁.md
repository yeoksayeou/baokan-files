Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 12th - Scientists from various countries meeting in Puwash, Canada, to discuss how to avoid atomic disaster issued a statement on the 11th after the meeting, advocating the abolition of war and the elimination of the threat of war. The statement was signed by twenty prominent scientists from ten countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Japan, Canada, Austria, and Australia. Chinese scientist Zhou Peiyuan signed the statement. The statement said: "War must be finally abolished, not merely limited to restricting the weapons that can be used in war."

“To achieve this goal, it is necessary to ease international tensions, promote mutual understanding among the people of all countries, strive to end the arms race, and establish an appropriate supervisory system to provide concrete guarantees and enable the development of mutual trust.”

They pointed out that they had reached an "unquestionable conclusion," which is: "A nuclear war would mean a disaster of unprecedented proportions."

The statement said that the radioactive hazards produced by nuclear weapons war are "thousands of times greater than the hazards of particles produced by experimental explosions." Even countries not directly bombed may be harmed by particles.

    聚会加拿大的各国科学家发表声明
    主张结束军备竞赛消除战争威胁
    据新华社12日讯　渥太华消息：在加拿大的浦华希开会讨论如何避免原子灾难的各国科学家11日在会议结束后发表了一个声明，主张废止战争和消除战争的威胁。在声明上签字的有苏联、中国、波兰、英国、美国、法国、日本、加拿大、奥地利和澳大利亚等十国的著名科学家共二十人，中国科学家周培源在声明上签了字。声明说：“战争必须最后予以废弃，而不是仅仅限于对战争所可以用的武器加以限制。”
    “为了达到这个目的，就有必要缓和国际间的紧张局势，促进各国人民间的互相谅解，竭力设法结束军备竞赛，并且建立一种适当的监督制度以便提供具体的保障而且使相互间的信任得以发展”。
    他们指出，他们已经得出一个“不容置疑的结论”，那就是：“一次核武器大战一定会意味着一次空前规模的灾难”。
    声明说，核武器战争所产生的放射危害性，“比试验性爆炸所产生的微粒的危害性要大成千倍”。就是在没有直接被炸的国家，也可能受微粒之害。
