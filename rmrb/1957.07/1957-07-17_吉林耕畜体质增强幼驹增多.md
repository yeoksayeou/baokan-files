Changchun dispatch from our newspaper: The trend of livestock being thin and dying in Jilin province has been reversed. In Yushu County, last spring 50% of draft animals were at half condition, but this year over 80% of draft animals have reached seven or eight tenths condition; in Baicheng and Anguang this year, the mortality rate of draft animals has decreased by 80% compared to the same period last year.

The enthusiasm of farmers for raising draft animals is also higher than last year. As of the end of May, more than 90,000 horses across the province have been bred, and the number of matings at the 32 state-run mating stations in Nongan County has increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year.

Due to attention to delivery and foal care, young animals are healthy and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced.

The improvement in livestock feeding in Jilin Province is mainly due to the change from the blind centralized feeding methods of last year. Last winter, the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture held a provincial livestock work conference, which proposed the method of "dividing large groups into small groups, and feeding by team and trough." And it rationally adjusted the remuneration of feeders, and established systems of labor, responsibility, rewards and punishments. Without affecting collective production, members are allowed to raise a certain number of small livestock at home and reclaim small plots of wasteland to increase feed sources.

    吉林耕畜体质增强幼驹增多
    本报长春电　吉林省牲畜瘦弱、死亡的现象有了扭转。榆树县去年春天半膘的耕畜占50％，今年则有80％以上的耕畜达到七、八成膘；白城、安广今年耕畜死亡率比去年同期降低了80％。
    农民饲养耕畜的积极性也比去年高。5月末，全省已有九万多匹马配种，农安县三十二个国营配马站所配种的头数，比去年同时期提高40％以上。
    由于注意接产护驹工作，幼畜身格健康，死亡率大量减少。
    吉林省喂养牲畜情况好转，主要是改变了去年盲目集中饲养的办法。去年冬天，吉林省农业厅召开全省牧畜工作会议，提出了“划大群为小群，分队、分槽”饲养管理的方法。并且合理地调整了饲养员的报酬，建立了使役、责任、奖惩等制度。在不影响集体生产的情况下，允许社员家庭饲养一定数量的小牲畜，开垦小片荒地，以增加饲料来源。
