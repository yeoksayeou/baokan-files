    Guarantee Early Completion of the 1957 National Plan
    Shenyang and Moscow Transformer Factories Launch Friendship Competition
    (Our Shenyang dispatch, July 8th) (Reporter Wen Tianshen) The entire workforce of the Shenyang Transformer Factory held a conference on the afternoon of July 7th, passing a guarantee to respond to the recent initiative proposed by the Soviet Union's Moscow Kuibyshev Transformer Factory to launch a socialist friendship competition.
    The friendship between the Moscow Transformer Factory and the Shenyang Transformer Factory was established as early as 1950. The Soviet government once dispatched Comrade Nazarewski, the chief engineer of the factory, to the Shenyang Transformer Factory to help with reconstruction and technical transformation work. The Shenyang Transformer Factory has also successively selected more than ten engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers to go to the Moscow Transformer Factory to study.
    Recently, when Tang Mingqi, chief engineer of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, accompanied the delegation of our Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry to the Soviet Union to participate in the Socialist Eight Nations Technical Cooperation Conference, the Moscow Transformer Factory was launching a labor competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The factory's workers enthusiastically wrote a letter through the Chinese delegation to their brotherly Shenyang Transformer Factory, initiating a friendship competition. The letter proposed competition conditions for completing the 1957 national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, and stated: in order to make the fraternal relationship between the two sides closer and strengthen the exchange of experience, they will conduct systematic communication, send technical materials and factory newspapers, and exchange representatives, etc. This letter was warmly welcomed by all the staff and workers of the Shenyang Transformer Factory. At the conference held by more than 4,000 workers on the 7th, the workers also put forward guarantee conditions for completing the 1957 national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, based on the production situation of their own factory.
    Comrade Nazarewski, the chief engineer of the Moscow Transformer Factory, who is in Shenyang, was invited to attend the conference.

    保证提前完成1957年国家计划
    沈阳莫斯科两变压器厂开展友谊竞赛
    本报沈阳8日电　记者文天申报道：沈阳变压器厂全体职工7日下午举行大会，通过一项保证书，响应苏联莫斯科古比雪夫变压器厂最近向他们提出的开展社会主义友谊竞赛的倡议。
    莫斯科变压器厂和沈阳变压器厂的友谊，早在1950年就已建立起来。苏联政府曾经派遣这个厂的总工程师那卓列夫斯基同志到沈阳变压器厂帮助进行改建和技术改造工作。沈阳变压器厂也曾经先后选派了十多名工程技术人员和技术工人到莫斯科变压器厂去学习。
    最近，沈阳变压器厂总工程师汤明奇随同我国电机工业部代表团到苏联参加社会主义八国技术合作会议的时候，莫斯科变压器厂正在开展迎接十月革命四十周年的劳动竞赛。这个厂的职工们热情地通过中国代表团，写信向兄弟的沈阳变压器厂发起开展友谊竞赛。信里提出了提前并超额完成1957年国家计划的竞赛条件，并且表示：为了使双方兄弟般的关系更加密切和加强经验交流，将进行有系统的通讯，寄技术资料和工厂报刊，以及交换代表等。这封信受到沈阳变压器厂全体职工的热烈欢迎。在7日四千多名职工举行的大会上，职工们也针对自己工厂的生产情况，提出了提前和超额完成1957年国家计划的竞赛保证条件。
    正在沈阳的莫斯科变压器厂总工程师那卓列夫斯基同志，应邀出席了这次大会。
