Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. More than ten oil-bearing structures have been discovered in the Huanxian, Qingyang, and Zhenyuan areas of the western Ordos Basin in Gansu. Preliminary drilling has found oil traces in all of these structures, and some have even discovered asphalt. Geologists and drilling personnel extracted black cores that emanated a strong petroleum smell and could be ignited with a lit match.

Petroleum prospecting work began in the western part of the Ordos Basin last year. The above discoveries indicate that this area is a promising new oil exploration region. Currently, thousands of people involved in electrical surveying, geophysics, geology, and drilling are working here; Yumen Oilfield has also sent two hundred workers to support them.

    甘肃鄂尔多斯地台西部
    发现石油储油构造
    新华社兰州8日电　鄂尔多斯地台西部的环县、庆阳、镇原地区，发现了十多个石油储油构造。经过初步钻探，在这些构造里都找到了油苗，有的还发现了沥青。地质钻探人员把黑色的岩芯取上来，上面散发着浓郁的石油味，划根火柴一点就着。
    在鄂尔多斯地台的西部，去年就开始了石油的普查工作。以上的发现，说明这一带是很有希望的石油新探地区。现在，有上千名电测、地球物理、地质和钻探等人员，正在这里进行工作；玉门油矿也派出了二百个工人前去支援。
