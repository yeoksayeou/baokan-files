Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th - The Kailuan Coal Mine's Majiagou Mine, which was submerged for eighteen years, has been restored. On July 1st, as workers celebrated the anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, coal from the 3961 working face was continuously hoisted from underground.

The Majiagou Mine is a mine with a glorious history of revolutionary struggle. During the period of imperialist rule over the Kailuan Coal Mine, the miners carried out many heroic strikes, and the miners of the Majiagou Mine always stood at the forefront of the struggle. In order to disintegrate the revolutionary fighting spirit of the miners, the imperialists dismantled the machines under the suppression of machine guns in January 1936 and closed the mine. Since then, this mine built by the sweat and blood of the workers has become a dilapidated ruin, and the entire mine has been flooded with water.

The Communist Party has brought new life to this mine, which had been "dead" for many years. At the end of 1954, the Party and state organs listed the Majiagou mine restoration project as one of the key construction projects, organized strong support from all over the country, and transferred a large number of machines and technical forces. After two and a half years of comprehensive restoration, this mine has been built into a new type of automated mine.

### 被帝国主义破坏了多年的矿井复生  开滦马家沟矿开始出煤

    被帝国主义破坏了多年的矿井复生
    开滦马家沟矿开始出煤
    据新华社保定4日电　曾经被水淹没十八年的矿山——开滦煤矿马家沟矿，经过修复，7月1日，正当工人们欢庆中国共产党的生日的时候，三九六一掌子的煤炭源源不断地从地下提升上来。
    马家沟矿是具有光荣革命斗争历史的矿山。在帝国主义统治开滦煤矿的时期，矿工们进行过多次英勇的罢工斗争，马家沟矿矿工总是站在斗争的最前列。帝国主义为瓦解矿工们的革命斗争士气，于1936年1月在机枪的镇压下，拆走了机器，停闭了这座煤矿。从此，工人们用血汗建成的这座矿山，变成了一片破乱不堪的废墟，积水淹没了整个矿井。
    共产党给这座“死”去多年的矿山，带来了新生。1954年底，党和国家机关把马家沟的复矿工程列为重要施工项目之一，组织全国各地大力支援，调来大批机器和技术力量。经过两年半的全面修复，把这个矿建成为自动化的新型矿井。
