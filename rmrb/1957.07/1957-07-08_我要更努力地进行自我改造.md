I said that I lacked the ability to discern Zhang Naiqi's long-standing anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership conspiracies, and I resonated with his absurd remarks beautifying the bourgeoisie, uglifying the working class and Communist Party members, especially his opposition to the Party's transformation policy under the guise of anti-dogmatism, and his so-called "encouragement of initiative." If the Party hadn't issued a stern warning this time, pointing out that the struggle against the rightists is a struggle between two roads, I might have become a prisoner of the rightists.

I completely agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports.

Premier Zhou's report, with irrefutable truths and facts, and concrete figures, expresses the brilliant achievements of our country's construction over the past few years, enabling us to clearly see the growth of socialism and the growth of people's happiness. This is a great victory for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

A few days ago, Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published. Through study, we can not only identify the two completely different types of social contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and within the people, but also more clearly realize that in the socialist family, we should and must judge the right and wrong of our words and deeds according to Chairman Mao's six criteria. This is very important for us to accept socialist transformation and serve socialist construction.

Premier Zhou's report, based on Chairman Mao's instructions on handling contradictions among the people, reviewed the government's work over the past year, affirmed the achievements, and pointed out the shortcomings; and righteously refuted the rightists who recently took the opportunity of the Party's rectification movement to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies. It is very clear that the masses want to help the Party in the rectification movement in order to ask the Party to better lead us in socialist construction. However, this small group of rightists harbored evil intentions, attempting to realize their ambitions through various slanders, provocations, and incitements. The purpose of these rightists is not to ask the Party to better lead us, but to usurp leadership; not to build a socialist society in our country more quickly, but to attempt to restore capitalism in China. They dream of reversing the road of historical progress. They violated the Constitution. They betrayed the will of the people.

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, we can see more clearly how these rightists deliberately obliterate achievements and exaggerate shortcomings. Since liberation, in just seven short years, the industrial development of New China and the funds invested in industrial construction have greatly exceeded the total of the old China in the hundred years before liberation. Taking the textile industry in which I am engaged as an example, the highest output of cotton yarn before liberation was only 2.44 million pieces, but in 1956 it had increased to 5.24 million pieces; the highest national cotton output before liberation was only 16 million dan, but in 1956, despite suffering great natural disasters, the output still reached 29 million dan. Not to mention the facts of the huge development of other production and construction. On the basis of the huge development of industrial and agricultural production, our country is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the people's lives are generally improving. This is something that even the enemy dare not deny, but the rightists have obliterated these achievements obtained by the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country on the road of socialism. What are their intentions?

In order to oppose socialism, the rightists have used every possible means to slander New China. Many things that can only be uttered by the enemy, they have brazenly taken to attack the Party and socialism in front of the people of the whole country. We say that the Communist Party is the leading force and core force of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction; but they say that this is "the Party's world" and want the Party to "step down," and even say that they want to kill the Communist Party. We say that the system of people's democratic dictatorship is the most fundamental guarantee for building a socialist society in our country, but they say that this is the root of all mistakes and shortcomings, and therefore openly advocate so-called "bicameral system," "political design institute," and even "rotation of power among various parties." We say that the victory of the Five-Anti Campaign guaranteed the smooth progress of the Three Major Transformations; but they want to engage in a so-called "rehabilitation committee" to "rehabilitate" embezzlers, thieves, and even counter-revolutionaries. In short, these rightists, against the conscience that an ordinary Chinese should have, reverse black and white and describe New China as "a mess," and even say that the Five-Year Plan is a failure, the state monopoly of purchase and marketing is terrible, and the people's living standards have declined. Some have even attempted to undermine the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance. They slander the leadership of the Communist Party and our national system from all aspects, attempting to achieve their anti-people and anti-socialist goals. Isn't such a purpose sinister?

As an industrialist and businessman, I especially want to mention Zhang Naiqi. He adopted a more insidious two-faced approach, verbally supporting the Communist Party and socialism, but judging from his consistent words and deeds, he systematically described the state's policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce as dogmatism, and described industrialists and businessmen willing to accept transformation as insincere. He described fixed interest as unearned income, not exploitation, equated the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie with the advancement and backwardness of the working class, and said that there was no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. He said that the national bourgeoisie is a revolutionary class. In essence, this denies the existence of class relations, denies that industrialists and businessmen still need to undergo thorough transformation, and incites industrialists and businessmen not to want socialism and not to want the leadership of the working class. More blatantly, after highly praising the operation of capitalist enterprises and exaggerating and uglifying the shortcomings of socialist enterprises, he put forward the absurd conclusion that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." This clearly reveals his original, concealed face of opposing socialism and supporting capitalism. He encouraged industrialists and businessmen to fight against public representatives, encouraged complaining, and supported the absurd views of backward industrialists and businessmen. He attempted to seize industrialists and businessmen under the leadership of the Party into his own hands.

These rightists have leaders, henchmen, strategists, and thugs; they look for openings and markets; they inherit and play all the "magic weapons" of capitalism in the same way, launching open and covert attacks on the Party and socialism from political, economic, cultural, and educational aspects. As Chairman Mao pointed out, what they are attacking is precisely the most fundamental thing of Marxism.

Looking at the history of these rightists, some started out by "opposing communism" in their early years, some consistently pursued the so-called "middle line" in politics, and some even owe the people blood debts. The Chinese people have not forgotten the historical facts, but have not calculated this old debt. After liberation, in order to unite all forces that could be united, the Party and the people gave them generous positions and stable lives, hoping that they would serve the people and do more good things. But they are ungrateful, repaying kindness with malice, eating the people's food, digging up the people's roots, and conspiring the restoration of capitalism to ride on the people's heads again. This is something we cannot tolerate.

Facts tell us that these rightists have tried every possible means to find their market among the masses. Especially for us in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles, because Shanghai used to be more concentrated in capitalist industry and commerce and was deeply influenced by capitalism, and the negative side of industrialists and businessmen still exists today, it is relatively easy to be bewitched and incited by these rightists, becoming their "market" for their ambitions. In fact, in the previous period, unhealthy trends did indeed rise in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, causing ideological confusion. We cannot but be deeply vigilant about these situations.

We admit that because our two-sidedness still exists, our negative side has countless connections with the dreams of these rightists. Therefore, when right and wrong cannot be clearly distinguished, we are swayed by their bewitchment and incitement, and we do sway. But we also have a positive side in accepting socialist transformation. Therefore, any fallacy of the rightists can only confuse us for a very short time. As long as the Party reminds us that they do not want socialism but want the restoration of capitalism, we can distinguish right from wrong and are bound to resolutely follow the working class on the road of socialism.

As mentioned earlier, Shanghai is a place where capitalist influence is deep, but it must also be stated that Shanghai is also the place where imperialism and bureaucratic capital oppressed the most painfully. National capital in Shanghai has suffered the most ruthless and cruel squeeze and blow from imperialism and bureaucratic capital. We clearly understand that our socialism has been earned by the blood and sweat of thousands of heroic martyrs and working people. Therefore, Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, after distinguishing right from wrong and understanding the good and the bad, are qualified to stand more firmly on the side of patriotism and socialism. If rightist ambitionists try to drag us back to the old path of colonies and ask us to fall into a tragic state of slavery again, they will definitely be met with our firm resistance.

We industrialists and businessmen have been educated by the Five-Anti Campaign. In particular, the Five-Anti Campaign gave us a profound inspiration: we must accept the leadership of the working class. Based on this, after nearly a few years of Party education, especially Chairman Mao's care and teachings for us, we want to master our own destiny, and further realize that only by combining with the future of the country can we have our own way out. Our happiness is closely linked to the future of socialism, and the happiness of our children and grandchildren is even more entrusted to socialism. We realize that "only socialism can save China," and without the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no socialism. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie is in the process of being eliminated; but as a member of the national bourgeoisie, we are accepting transformation and gradually moving towards socialism. As long as we continue to accept transformation, continue to study, and work hard, we can become self-reliant laborers. Since studying Chairman Mao's speech, we have become increasingly clear about this.

The rightists are different from us. They oppose socialism, have no common feelings with the 600 million people, and dream all day long of how to restore capitalism. What Zhang Naiqi said about the bourgeoisie not having two sides is indeed correct for these people, because they only have a negative side, a capitalist side. Therefore, during the Party's rectification period, they took the opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on socialism.

Now, the anger and denunciation of the people of the whole country has strongly told these bourgeois rightists that a decadent class, attempting to make a dying struggle before exiting the stage of history, is destined to fail. They can only repent, conduct a deep self-criticism, and honestly accept transformation, so as not to isolate themselves from the people.

We, the industrialists and businessmen of Shanghai, must strengthen our studies, strengthen our transformation, stand firm, and strictly draw a line between ourselves and the rightists in thought and action in the struggle against the rightists. Because we have been running private enterprises and living an exploitative life for a long time, and now we still have fixed interest to get, our ideological understanding has essential limitations. To varying degrees, we despise labor and look down on workers. Even if we theoretically understand the need to negate the bourgeoisie, achieving emotional consistency is still an arduous practical process. Therefore, there is still a certain distance between us and the working class in work, life, and thought. As for myself, it is precisely because I have the above-mentioned problems that I lacked the ability to discern Zhang Naiqi's long-standing anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies, and I was even once confused by his reactionary remarks on certain issues. The struggle against Zhang Naiqi actually began during the Second Plenary Session of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce last year. At that time, I completely disagreed with his point that the Chinese national bourgeoisie no longer had two sides after the high tide, but only regarded this as a matter of ideological understanding and criticized it. I did not feel the seriousness of the problem with some of his absurd remarks beautifying the bourgeoisie and uglifying the working class and Communist Party members. In particular, he opposed the Party's policy of transforming capitalism under the guise of anti-dogmatism, and resonated with the so-called "encouragement of private initiative," which had a negative impact on industrialists and businessmen in my work and failed to live up to the Party's education, training, and expectations of me. Moreover, I used to think that Zhang Naiqi was eloquent and talented, and did not see that this was a vicious means of wooing and inciting industrialists and businessmen; I thought he was very knowledgeable because he often quoted Marxist-Leninist works, and did not understand that this was his conspiracy to peddle revisionism and dream of restoring capitalism. If the Party had not issued a stern warning this time, pointing out that the struggle against the rightists is a struggle between two roads, I would not have realized that all his words and deeds are systematic conspiratorial activities, nor would I have realized that this is a class struggle, and I might have gradually approached his thoughts and actions and become his prisoner. I deeply realize that only by accepting the leadership of the Party can I avoid losing direction. In the future, we must learn from the lessons, temper ourselves, and test ourselves in the struggle against the rightists, seriously and conscientiously examine and criticize our shortcomings and mistakes, work harder to transform ourselves, and better align ourselves with the working class. In order to safeguard the Constitution, consolidate the basic system of the country, and strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country, we firmly stand with the working class and advance towards socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    我要更努力地进行自我改造
    荣毅仁说，我对于章乃器由来已久的反社会主义、反对党的领导的阴谋缺乏辨别能力，对他美化资产阶级，丑化工人阶级和共产党员的荒谬言论，特别是对他以反教条主义为幌子来反对党的改造政策，以及所谓“鼓励积极性”上，曾引起共鸣。如果不是这一次党大喝一声，指出对右派的斗争是两条道路的斗争，我就有可能成为右派分子的俘虏。
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，和其他各项报告。
    周总理的报告，以无可置辩的真理和事实，具体的数字表达出几年来我国建设的辉煌成绩，使我们清晰地看到了社会主义在成长，人民幸福在成长，这是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。
    前几天，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演发表了。通过学习，不仅仅使我们能够识别敌我之间和人民内部两类性质完全不同的社会矛盾，而且使我们更清醒地认识到在社会主义大家庭中，我们应该也必须根据毛主席的六条标准来判断我们的言论和行动的是非。这对于我们接受社会主义改造和为社会主义建设服务来说，是非常重要的。
    周总理的报告，根据毛主席指示的处理人民内部矛盾的方针，检查了一年来政府的工作，肯定了成绩，提出了缺点；并且义正词严地驳斥了最近在党的整风运动中，趁机会大肆活动，进行反党、反社会主义阴谋的右派分子。事情很清楚，群众所以要帮助党整风，原是要求党更好地来领导我们进行社会主义建设。但是，这一小撮右派分子，却包藏祸心，以各种的诬蔑、挑拨和煽动，企图实现他们的野心。这些右派分子的目的，不是为了要求党更好地来领导我们，而是为了要篡夺领导权；不是为了要在我国更迅速的建成社会主义社会，而是企图使资本主义在中国复辟。他们梦想扭转历史前进的道路。他们违反了宪法。他们背叛了全国人民的意志。
    听了周总理的报告，我们可以更清楚地看到，这些右派分子是怎样故意地在抹煞成绩，夸大缺点。自从解放以来，短短的七年之中，新中国的工业发展和投入工业建设的资金，大大超过了解放前旧中国一百年的总和。即以我所从事的纺织工业来说，解放前棉纱的最高产量只有二百四十四万件，但在一九五六年已增加到五百二十四万件；解放前全国棉花最高产量只有一千六百万担，但在一九五六年，虽然受到了很大的自然灾害，产量仍达到了二千九百万担。更不论其他生产建设巨大发展的事实了。在工农业生产巨大发展的基础上，我们国家日益的富强，人民的生活普遍改善，这是连敌人都不敢否认的，但是右派分子却抹煞这些由于中国共产党领导全国人民走社会主义道路所获得的成果，这是什么用心？
    右派分子为了反对社会主义，对新中国的诬蔑可说是无所不用其极。许多只有在敌人口中吐出来的东西，而他们却当着全国人民的面，肆无忌惮地拿来攻击党和社会主义。我们说：共产党是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量和核心力量；但他们却说这是“党天下”要党“下台”，甚至说要杀共产党。我们说：人民民主专政制度是我国建成社会主义社会最根本的保证，但他们却说这是一切错误和缺点的根源，因而公然主张要搞什么“两院制”、“政治设计院”以至要什么“各党派轮流执政”。我们说：五大运动的胜利保证了三大改造能够顺利进行；但他们却要搞什么“平反委员会”，要替贪污犯、盗窃犯以至反革命分子“平反”。总之，这些右派分子昧着一个普通中国人所应有的良心，颠倒黑白地把新中国说成“一团糟”，甚至说五年计划搞坏了，统购统销糟透了，人民生活水平下降了，有的还企图破坏中苏友好同盟。他们从各方面来诋毁共产党的领导和我们的国家制度，企图达到他们反人民、反社会主义的目的，这样的居心难道还不险恶吗？
    作为一个工商业者，我特别要提提章乃器。他采取了更阴险的两面派手法，口口声声拥护共产党，拥护社会主义，但是从他一贯的言行来看，他有系统的把国家对资本主义工商业进行和平改造的政策说成教条主义，把愿意接受改造的工商业者说成违心论者。他把定息说成不劳而获，不是剥削，把中国民族资产阶级的两面性和工人阶级的先进与落后混同起来，把资产阶级分子说成和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别。他说民族资产阶级是革命的阶级。实质上就是否认阶级关系的存在，否认工商业者还需要脱胎换骨的进行改造，也就是煽动工商业者不要社会主义，不要工人阶级领导。更露骨的是他在高度颂扬了资本主义企业的经营，夸大丑化了社会主义企业的缺点之后，提出了“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”的荒谬结论，这就清清楚楚的揭露了他原来遮遮掩掩的反对社会主义、拥护资本主义的本来面目。他鼓动工商业者向公方代表斗争，鼓励发牢骚，支持落后工商业者的荒谬主张。他企图把在党领导下的工商业者争夺到他自己的手里。
    这些右派分子，他们有首领，有爪牙，有军师，有打手；他们打缺口，找市场；他们一脉相承、异曲同工的祭起了所有资本主义的“法宝”，明枪暗箭，从政治、经济、文教等等各方面向党和社会主义进攻。他们所攻击的正如毛主席所指出的，正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。
    从这些右派分子历史来看，有的早年就是以“反共起家”，有的在政治上一贯奉行所谓“中间路线”，有的甚至还欠着老百姓的血债。中国人民没有忘怀了历史事实，但并没有计算这笔旧账。解放以后，为了团结一切可能团结的力量，党和人民还给了他们优厚的地位和安定的生活，希望他们为人民效力，多做好事。但是他们忘恩负义，以怨报德，吃人民的饭，挖人民的根，阴谋资本主义的复辟，再骑到人民头上来，这是我们所不能容忍的。
    事实告诉我们，这些右派分子，曾经千方百计在群众中找寻他们的市场。特别是对于我们上海工商界来说，由于上海过去资本主义工商业比较集中，受资本主义的影响较深，而今天工商业者的消极一面还是存在，因此就比较容易受到这些右派分子的蛊惑和煽动，成为他们野心的“市场”。事实上，在前一时期，上海工商界中也确实有歪风抬头，造成了思想上的混乱。对于这些情况，我们是不能不深深警惕的。
    我们承认，由于我们两面性还存在，我们的消极一面与这些右派分子的梦想有着千丝万缕的关系，因此当是非还不能辨别清楚的时候，我们受到了他们的蛊惑和煽动，确实是会摇摇摆摆起来的。但是我们还有接受社会主义改造的积极一面，因此任何右派分子的谬论，只能迷惑我们一个极短的时间。只要党提醒了我们：他们是不要社会主义，要资本主义复辟的时候，我们是能够明辨是非，是一定跟着工人阶级坚决地走社会主义道路的。
    前面说过，上海是资本主义影响较深的地方，但是也不能不说明，上海又是受帝国主义、官僚资本压迫最惨痛的地方。民族资本在上海承受过帝国主义、官僚资本最无情、最残酷的排挤和打击。我们清楚的懂得我们的社会主义是千千万万英雄烈士、劳动人民流血流汗得来的。因此，上海工商业者，在辨清是非、明白祸福之后，是有条件更坚决地站到爱国的、社会主义的一边来的。如果右派分子野心家，企图把我们拖回殖民地的老路，叫我们重陷于悲惨的奴隶境地，他一定受到我们坚决的反击。
    我们工商业者是受过五大运动的教育的。尤其是五反运动，更给了我们一个深刻的启示：我们必须接受工人阶级的领导。从这个基础上出发，经过近几年来党的教育，特别是毛主席对我们的关心和教导，我们要掌握自己的命运，更使我们认识到只有结合国家的前途，才有我们自己的出路。我们的幸福是和社会主义前途紧密地结合着的，我们子孙后代的幸福更寄托于社会主义。我们认识到“只有社会主义能够救中国”，而离开了共产党的领导，就没有社会主义。因此，民族资产阶级是正在消灭的过程中；但作为一个民族资产阶级分子，我们却在接受改造，逐步向着社会主义前进。只要我们继续接受改造，继续学习，努力工作，我们是能够成为自食其力的劳动者的。这一点，自从学习了毛主席的讲话之后，我们是越来越清楚了。
    右派分子和我们不一样。他们反对社会主义，和六亿人民没有共同的感情，成天梦想的只是如何使资本主义复辟。章乃器说的资产阶级没有两面性，对这些人说来，倒确是说对了，因为他们只有消极一面，资本主义一面。所以在党的整风时期，就乘机发作，向社会主义发动了猖狂进攻。
    现在，全国人民的愤怒和声讨，已经非常强烈地告诉了这些资产阶级右派分子，一个腐朽了的阶级，在退出历史舞台以前，企图作垂死挣扎，是命中注定要失败的。他们只有憣然悔悟，深刻检讨，老老实实接受改造，才不致自绝于人民。
    我们上海工商业者，在对右派分子作斗争中，一定要加强学习，加强改造，站稳立场，与右派分子在思想上、行动上严格划清界限。由于我们长期经营着私营企业，过着剥削生活，现在还有定息可得，思想认识有本质上的局限性，在不同程度上轻视劳动，看不起工人，即使是在理论上弄懂了否定资产阶级，要求得感情上的一致还是一个艰巨的实践过程。因此在工作上、生活上、思想上与工人阶级还存在着一定的距离。就我自己来说，正因为有上述毛病，对章乃器由来已久的反党、反社会主义的阴谋就缺乏辨别能力，甚至在某些问题上一度曾被他的反动言论所迷惑。对章乃器的斗争实际上在去年民建二中全会的时候即已展开，我当时对他所提出的中国民族资产阶级在高潮后已经没有两面性的论点，是完全不同意的，但只认为这是思想认识问题而加以批判，而对他当时美化资产阶级、丑化工人阶级和共产党员的一些荒谬言论就没有感到问题的严重性，特别是他以反教条主义为幌子来反对党对资本主义改造的政策，在所谓“鼓励私方积极性”上曾引起了共鸣，因此在工作中对工商业者起了不良的影响，辜负了党对我的教育培养和期望。而且我过去还以为章乃器能话辩，很有才干，没有看到这是拉拢、煽动工商业者的毒辣手段；听了他经常引马列主义的著作认为他很有学问，没有懂得这是他贩卖修正主义、梦想恢复资本主义的阴谋。如果不是这一次党大喝一声，指出对右派分子的斗争是两条道路的斗争，我就不会认识到他的一切言行是有系统的阴谋活动，亦不会认识到这是一场阶级斗争，而且可能逐步的与他的思想行动接近起来，成为他的俘虏。我深深体会到只有接受党的领导，才不致迷失方向。今后我们更要在对右派分子的斗争中，吸取教训，锻炼自己，考验自己，严肃认真的检查和批判自己的缺点和错误，更努力的进行自我改造，更好的靠拢工人阶级。为了维护宪法，巩固国家的基本制度，加强全国人民的团结，我们坚决与工人阶级站在一起，在中国共产党的领导下，向社会主义前进。
