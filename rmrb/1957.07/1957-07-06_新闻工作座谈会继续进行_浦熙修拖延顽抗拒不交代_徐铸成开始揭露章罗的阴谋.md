Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Today's news work symposium followed the agenda decided at yesterday's adjournment, which was to listen to Pu Xixiu's "confession." However, Pu Xixiu used many empty words to evade the questions raised by everyone. When Pu Xixiu talked about the Luo Longji clique, she said: "Yang Hu is his (referring to Luo Longji, same below) sworn brother, Long Yun is the person who appreciates him the most, and Huang Shaohong is also his close friend. In the early days of liberation, he had the closest relationship with Zhang Dongsun. They often became animated when they talked about World War III."

Xie Weiming of Wenhui Daily, Kong Zhaokai of Ta Kung Pao, Zhou Qiyu of Workers' Daily, and students of the Journalism Department of Renmin University refuted and questioned Pu's "confession." Xie Weiming said: For more than a decade, Pu Xixiu has often claimed to be a "loyal friend" of the Communist Party. In fact, Pu Xixiu had already drawn a line with the Communist Party more than a decade ago. Her ex-husband, Yuan Ziying, had agreed with her that Yuan would not join the Kuomintang and Pu would not join the Communist Party. Pu agreed to this at the time. Wang Yunsheng pointed out: Liu Guanghua, a Wenhui Daily reporter frequently mentioned by Pu Xixiu, is the son of Liu Wangliming and has close ties with Luo Longji. After the Party proposed rectification, it was discovered that Liu Guanghua had "ignited fires" in two organizations, inciting anti-Party sentiments. How did Pu Xixiu recruit Liu Guanghua to Wenhui Daily? Pu Xixiu answered some of these questions vaguely, and avoided answering others. At 6:30 p.m., the chairman announced the adjournment. Pu Xixiu is to continue her confession next Monday.

Xu Zhucheng revealed that Zhang Bojun had expressed to Li Zongren his willingness to cooperate with him in forming a political party.

Xu Zhucheng said when confessing his relationship with Zhang and Luo: I met Zhang Bojun in Chongqing in the spring of 1945, together with Li Meng, the head of the Kuomintang Guangxi Daily and confidant of the reactionary leader Li Zongren. At that time, Zhang Bojun asked Li Meng to tell Li Zongren to quickly form a political party, and Zhang Bojun also said that he could cooperate with Li Zongren on this matter. In 1948, I went to Hong Kong to seek Zhang Bojun's help in solving Wenhui Daily's financial difficulties, and we have been in contact ever since. At that time, Zhang Bojun told me that the international workers' movement was declining, and the domestic war situation was also a stalemate. The Communist Party did not have the strength to unify all of China, and your newspaper should maintain a detached attitude. Xu Zhucheng admitted that he was indeed influenced by him. He said that when the National People's Congress met in 1955, Zhang Bojun invited me to dinner, and I told him that Wenhui Daily had decided to join the Teacher's Newspaper. He was very indignant and said that he must speak fairly. In April of last year, I learned that Zhang Bojun had privately made plans for the capitalists Yu Shunmao brothers (sons of Yu Qiaqing) of Shanghai Hongan Steamship Company to accuse the Shanghai Shipping Bureau to the central government. Zhang Bojun also told the Yu brothers to visit the new residential areas outside the city more often to see what the government had done with their money. Zhang Bojun had Yang Hu's confidant hidden in his home, and after liberation, he arranged for him to work in the Shanghai Shipping Bureau, wanting him to seize power.

A person named Guo had lived in Zhang's house for a long time, responsible for contacting the Yu brothers. This person is the son-in-law of Zhu Peide and a confidant of the special agent Yang Hu. It was through him that Zhang Bojun was sent to Hong Kong in 1947, and Zhang Bojun received a lot of money from the Yu brothers. After liberation, Zhang Bojun tried to send this person named Guo to work in the Shanghai Shipping Bureau, wanting him to merge several shipping companies such as Sanbei and Hongan and seize control of them. Xu Zhucheng said: In June of last year, Zhang Bojun invited me, Chu Anping, Xiao Qian, and others to dinner. He told me: "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is just to let the intellectuals express their grievances. Socialist construction depends on intellectuals. Wenhui Daily should "contend" well and release a flower in the journalism field. Guangming Daily should also be reorganized. Xu Zhucheng said: Chu Anping came to Shanghai to see me in February this year and asked about the organization of Wenhui Daily's editorial department and how many reporters were sent out. He also asked how the film discussion was going. I said that criticism is now very strong, and fewer people are making suggestions. He said: "These things cannot be discussed freely, so what is there to talk about freedom of speech?" Xu Zhucheng also talked about Luo Longji's lavish banquet at home to plan the direction of Wenhui Daily before its resumption last year, but there was nothing new. Xu Zhucheng said: Pu Xixiu has always promoted to me that Luo Longji is a straightforward and good person, and the Party Central Committee trusts him more and more in recent years; she also said that Luo Longji is best at planning for others. She gave me two examples: One was that Sun Dayu came to Beijing last year to find Luo Longji, and as a result, Luo gave him ideas, and Sun Dayu's thinking was straightened out; the other was Pan Dakui, Luo Longji let him stay in Sichuan to take charge alone, and not come to the central government. Pu Xixiu repeatedly said in her self-criticism that she did not know about Luo Longji and the activities of his clique. What do these two examples illustrate? Xu Zhucheng said that after I returned to Shanghai this time, Lu Yi, Zhang Mengwen, and others were particularly polite to me. Two reporters from Wenhui Daily, Lu Wen and Cai Ping, also told me from time to time how Lu Yi and others cared about Wenhui Daily. After Xu Zhucheng's confession, someone passed notes and speeches asking him to continue to confess specifically in the future.

Xu Zhucheng's service to the Zhang-Luo alliance has historical roots.

Xinhua News Agency and Ta Kung Pao reported that at the news work symposium continued on the 4th, Pu Xixiu delayed, denied, and refused to confess the true situation of the Luo Longji-Pu Xixiu-Wenhui Daily editorial department, a system of rightists in the China Democratic League, which was strongly criticized by everyone. Under the indignant mood of the crowd, Pu Xixiu said that she would "honestly confess her crimes against the people" tomorrow.

Li Longmu of the Advanced Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said in his speech that he had worked with Xu Zhucheng in Wenhui Daily before liberation and knew Xu Zhucheng's political views very well. Xu's political attitude at that time was very close to that of Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and others. He took the "third road," advocating that the newspaper should both scold the Kuomintang and scold the Communist Party, expressing that he was in a "detached" position. Therefore, anti-Soviet and anti-communist articles also appeared in the newspaper. Xu Zhucheng's struggle with the party members and leftists who worked in Wenhui Daily at that time was very sharp, and there were also debates in the newspaper. On the same issue, the opinions of the editorials published by Wenhui Daily before and after were often inconsistent. This was because the previous one was written by Xu Zhucheng, and the viewpoint was unfavorable to the Party, so Comrade Huanxiang had to write another one to make up for it. On October 19, 1946, Xu Zhucheng wrote an article in the "Editor's Note" column of Wenhui Daily disagreeing with the Communist Party's proposal to restore the "January 13" military position, and Xinhua News Agency specially issued a short commentary to refute it at that time. After the withdrawal of the CCP delegation, Xu Zhucheng's political views on the "third road" became even stronger. After Wenhui Daily was banned in May 1947, Xu Zhucheng proposed to the Kuomintang that it could exclude some leftist figures within the newspaper in order to resume publication. Later, Wenhui Daily moved to Hong Kong to publish, and Xu Zhucheng excluded Communist Party members such as Huanxiang. Li Longmu pointed out that the serious errors of the Wenhui Daily in the bourgeois direction are inseparable from Xu Zhucheng's consistent political views.

Kong Zhaokai of Ta Kung Pao criticized Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng's bad attitude of refusing to confess their relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance. At the same time, he also examined some of the mistakes that appeared on the pages of Ta Kung Pao recently. The nature of these mistakes is serious, because they happened to be at a time when rightists were frantically attacking the leadership of the Party and the socialist road, playing a bad role in fueling the flames and helping the war. He said: The "Empty Interview in Inner Mongolia" published by Ta Kung Pao and the reports on "Beijing Cancels Free Vegetable Market," "Beijing Housing Exchange," and this year's "June 1" news reports and commentaries, as well as some essays, are all inconsistent with the actual situation and contain provocative errors. Kong Zhaokai also said that the errors of Ta Kung Pao are certainly not limited to these, and he will continue to examine them in order to draw correct conclusions and improve his work.

Zhang Henshui read out his joint statement with Zhao Chaogou, Zhang Youluan, Chen Mingde, and Deng Jixing at the meeting, demanding that Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng make a good confession. Gao Ji of People's Daily and Mei Duo of Wenhui Daily also exposed and refuted Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu's anti-socialist remarks and deeds at the meeting. (Attached picture)

### 新闻工作座谈会继续进行  浦熙修拖延顽抗拒不交代  徐铸成开始揭露章罗的阴谋

    新闻工作座谈会继续进行
    浦熙修拖延顽抗拒不交代
    徐铸成开始揭露章罗的阴谋
    罗隆基一提起第三次世界大战就眉飞色舞
    据新华社5日讯　今日的新闻工作座谈会按照昨天散会时决定的议程是听取浦熙修的“交代”。但浦熙修用了许多空洞话来搪塞大家对她提出的问题。浦熙修谈到罗隆基小集团时说：“杨虎是他（指罗隆基，以下同）的拜把兄弟，龙云是最赏识他的人，黄绍竑也是他的密友。解放初期，他和张东荪往来最密切。他们谈到第三次世界大战时，常常眉飞色舞。”
    文汇报谢蔚明、大公报孔昭恺、工人日报周起予、人民大学新闻系同学等对浦的“交代”纷纷提出驳斥和质问。谢蔚明说：浦熙修十几年来常常以共产党的“忠实朋友”自命。事实上早在十几年前浦熙修已经和共产党划了界限，她的前夫袁子英曾经和她约定过，袁不参加国民党，浦不参加共产党。当时浦是答应了的。王芸生提出：浦熙修经常提到的文汇报记者刘光华是刘王立明的儿子，和罗隆基有密切联系，党提出整风后，已经发现刘光华曾经在两个机关“点火”，煽动反党情绪，浦熙修是怎样吸收刘光华到文汇报的？浦熙修对于这些问题，有的支支吾吾地作了答复，有的避而不答。下午六时半，主席宣布休会。下星期一要浦熙修继续交代。
    徐铸成揭露章伯钧曾向李宗仁表示、愿同他合作搞一个政党。
    徐铸成在交代他和章罗的关系时说：我是1945年春天在重庆和国民党广西日报社长、反动头子李宗仁的亲信黎蒙一起认识章伯钧的。那次章伯钧就叫黎蒙转告李宗仁赶快搞一个政党，章伯钧还说自己可以在这件事上和李宗仁合作。1948年，我在香港曾找章伯钧帮助文汇报解决经济困难，并从此有了交往。那时候章伯钧就对我说，国际工人运动是在走下坡路了，国内战局也是拖的局面，共产党要统一全中国没有这个力量，你们报纸还是要保持超然的态度。徐铸成承认自己的确受了他的影响。他说，1955年人大开会时章伯钧约我吃饭，我告诉他文汇报决定参加教师报。他大为抱不平，说他一定要讲公道话。去年4月，我知道章伯钧曾私下为上海鸿安轮船公司的资本家虞顺懋兄弟（虞洽卿的儿子）定计划，向中央控告上海航运局。章伯钧还曾对虞家兄弟说，有空多到城外看看新住宅区，看看政府拿了你们的钱，做了些什么事。章伯钧家里藏了杨虎的亲信，解放后把他安插到上海航运局、要他抓住实力。
    有一个姓郭的人，很早就住在章的家里，负责和虞家兄弟联系。这人是朱培德的女婿，又是特务杨虎的亲信，1947年就是通过他把章伯钧送到香港去的，章伯钧曾得了虞家兄弟不少钱。解放后，章伯钧就设法把这个姓郭的派到上海航运局工作，要他把三北、鸿安等几个航运公司合并，抓在手里。徐铸成说：去年6月，章伯钧约我和储安平、萧乾等吃饭。他就对我说：百家争鸣就是要知识分子发发他们的牢骚，社会主义建设是要靠知识分子的，文汇报要好好地“鸣”，在新闻界放出一朵花来，光明日报也要改组。徐铸成说：储安平今年2月到上海曾经看我，问文汇报编辑部组织如何，在外面派多少记者，他又问电影讨论怎样了。我说现在反批评很厉害，提意见的少了。他说：“这些事都不能自由讨论，还谈什么言论自由。”徐铸成也谈到了去年文汇报复刊前，罗隆基在家里大宴宾客、策划文汇报方针的事，但没有什么新的内容。徐铸成说：浦熙修一直对我宣传罗隆基是一个心直口快的好人，这几年党中央越来越信任他了；又说罗隆基最会替别人打算。她给我说了两个例子：一个是孙大雨去年曾来京找罗隆基，结果是罗给他出了主意，孙大雨的思想就搞通了；另一个是潘大逵，罗隆基就让他留四川独当一面，不要到中央来。浦熙修在检查中一再说她不知道罗隆基和他的小集团的活动，上面这两个例子又说明什么呢？徐铸成说，我这次回上海后，陆诒、张孟闻等见了我特别客气，文汇报的两个记者吕文、蔡平也不时向我说陆诒等人如何关心文汇报。徐铸成交代后，有人递条子和发言要他以后继续具体交代。
    徐铸成为章罗联盟效劳有历史根源
    据新华社和大公报报道　在4日继续举行的新闻工作座谈会上，浦熙修拖延、抵赖、拒不交代罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部这一民盟右派系统的真实情况，遭到了大家有力的抨击，在群情愤慨下，浦熙修说她将在明天“老老实实地交代对人民的罪行”。
    中共中央高级党校新闻班李龙牧在发言中说，他解放前和徐铸成在文汇报共事，对徐铸成的政治主张了解得很清楚。徐当时的政治态度和罗隆基、储安平等人非常接近，走“第三条路线”，主张在报纸上既骂国民党，也骂共产党，表示自己处在“超然”的地位，因此报纸上也出现过反苏反共的文章。徐铸成和当时在文汇报工作的党员和左派人士斗争非常尖锐，在报纸上也有争论。同一个问题，文汇报前后发表的社论意见时常不一致，这是因为前一篇是徐铸成写的，观点对党不利，宦乡同志只得再写一篇来弥补。1946年10月19日徐铸成曾在文汇报“编者的话”栏里写了不同意共产党主张恢复“一·十三”军事位置的文章，当时新华社还特地发了短论加以驳斥。中共代表团撤退后，徐铸成“第三条路线”的政治主张更为强烈。1947年5月文汇报被封后，徐铸成为了复刊，曾向国民党提出可以排斥报社内部一些左派人物的意见。以后文汇报搬到香港出刊，徐铸成就排斥了宦乡等共产党员。李龙牧指出：文汇报所犯的资产阶级方向的严重错误，和徐铸成的一贯政治主张是分不开的。
    大公报的孔昭恺批判了浦熙修、徐铸成拒不交代他们和章罗同盟的关系的恶劣态度。同时也检查了在最近期间，大公报版面上出现了一些错误。这些错误的性质是严重的，因为它们正好是在右派分子向党的领导和社会主义道路猖狂进攻之际，起了推波助澜、点火助战的坏作用。他说：大公报发表的“内蒙采访扑空记”和关于“北京取消蔬菜自由市场”、“北京市调换房屋”的报道以及今年“六一”的新闻报道和言论，还有一些杂文，都是和实际情况不符和带有挑拨性的错误的。孔昭恺还说大公报的错误当然不止这些，还要继续检查，以便作出正确的结论，改进工作。
    张恨水在会上宣读了他同赵超构、张友鸾、陈铭德、邓季惺的联合发言，要求浦熙修和徐铸成好好交代。人民日报的高集和文汇报的梅朵也在会上对徐铸成和浦熙修反社会主义言行进行了揭发和驳斥。（附图片）
