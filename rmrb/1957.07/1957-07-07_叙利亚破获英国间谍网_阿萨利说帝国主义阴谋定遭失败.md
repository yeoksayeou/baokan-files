Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 6th - Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali issued a statement on July 4 regarding the Syrian government's recent uncovering of a British spy network, saying, "We warn the imperialist countries and their lackeys that we are already on guard against them and ready to deal with them. All conspiracies will fail. Arab nationalism will triumph."

Asali also said that the imperialist governments, especially the British government, "have been organizing conspiracies to harm our country's independence and our unity with our fraternal Arab countries. Their conspiracies include the 'Greater Syria Plan,' the Fertile Crescent Plan, the Baghdad Pact, and other plans aimed at undermining 'Arab solidarity.'"

According to Damascus newspapers, the main members of this spy network, which worked for the British intelligence service, were arrested on June 8. They are George Anjum, a Lebanese employee of the Canadian Embassy in Beirut, Issam Mamlouk, a Damascus lawyer, and Wahid Mili, a customs police officer. The leader of this spy organization, George Anjum, had also been employed by the British Commercial Counselor's Office in Damascus before the diplomatic relations between Britain and Syria were severed due to the British aggression against Egypt.

Documents seized from the spies contained important and secret intelligence regarding the Syrian political situation, the Syrian army, its new weapons, deployments, tasks, and information on officers. Receipts for allowances signed by the spies were also found.

    叙利亚破获英国间谍网
    阿萨利说帝国主义阴谋定遭失败
    新华社大马士革6日电　叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨利7月4日就叙利亚政府最近破获英国间谍网一事发表声明说，“我们警告帝国主义国家和他们的走狗们，我们对他们已经有了戒备，已经准备好对付他们。一切阴谋都要失败。阿拉伯民族主义将取得胜利。”
    阿萨利又说，帝国主义政府，特别是英国政府“一直在组织阴谋诡计危害我国的独立和我国与兄弟的阿拉伯国家的团结。它们的阴谋诡计包括‘大叙利亚计划’肥沃新月计划、巴格达条约以及其他一些旨在破坏‘阿拉伯的团结一致’的计划。”
    据大马士革报纸报道，这个为英国情报处工作的间谍网的主要成员已经在6月8日被逮捕。他们是加拿大驻贝鲁特大使馆的黎巴嫩籍雇员乔治·安詹姆，大马士革律师伊萨姆·马姆卢克和海关警察瓦希德·米利。这个间谍组织的首领乔治·安詹姆在英叙两国由于英国侵略埃及而断绝外交关系以前，还曾受雇于英国驻大马士革商务参赞处。
    从间谍处搜出的文件中有关于叙利亚政局、叙利亚军队、它的新武器及调动和任务和军官们的情况等重要和秘密情报。间谍们签收的津贴收据也搜查出来了。
