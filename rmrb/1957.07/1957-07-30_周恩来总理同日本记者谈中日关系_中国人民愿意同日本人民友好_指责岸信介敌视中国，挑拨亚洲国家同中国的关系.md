Xinhua News Agency, July 29th. When Premier Zhou Enlai met with the Japanese Private Broadcasting Federation delegation headed by Masayasu Tajiri and reporters from Kyodo News, Asahi Shimbun on July 25th, he made a statement to them on Sino-Japanese relations.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese people are willing to be friendly with the Japanese people after the war. This can be seen from the efforts made by the Chinese side in the eight years since liberation. On the other hand, judging from our contact with Japanese friends visiting China and from the activities of the Japanese people in Japan, the Japanese people are also willing to be friendly with the Chinese people. These two are the basic conditions for developing Sino-Japanese friendship. Based on the friendly wishes of the two peoples, exchanges between them are becoming more frequent. In their contact with the Chinese people, Japanese friends can also feel that the Chinese people are willing to gradually dilute the unpleasant relationship that once existed in the past, and develop new friendly relations on the basis of nearly two thousand years of friendship with each other. This is not only possible, but its practicality is also increasing day by day.

The friendly activities of the two peoples and the signing of non-governmental agreements have greatly developed the relations between the two countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that in recent years, many non-governmental organizations and semi-official organizations in China and Japan have signed many agreements, and most of these agreements have been implemented. Although China and Japan have not yet restored normal relations, and a state of war still exists under international law, these have not hindered the friendly activities of the two peoples and the signing of non-governmental agreements. Starting with frequent non-governmental exchanges and reaching agreements, the relationship between the two countries has been greatly developed. Finally, the only remaining thing is to declare the end of the state of war and restore normal relations diplomatically.

Premier Zhou Enlai said, we can say that our approach has created a new model in the history of international relations. We are carrying out people-to-people diplomacy with such a pleasant and hopeful mood. We regard people-to-people diplomacy as an important part of our entire diplomacy. I hope Japanese friends can also see it this way.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that my view has been echoed by many Japanese friends. As for the Japanese government, we must conduct a concrete analysis. Former Prime Minister Yoshida was hostile to China, so there was no friendly wish to speak of. However, the two former Prime Ministers Hatoyama and Ishibashi had this wish. As for Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, he should have further expressed this wish, but the fact proves that the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet has regressed compared with the Hatoyama and Ishibashi cabinets.

Premier Zhou Enlai then cited some examples of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's hostility towards China and its attempts to provoke relations between Asian countries and China, and refuted them one by one.

Nobusuke Kishi's support for Chiang Kai-shek's "recovery of the mainland" aroused great resentment among the Chinese people.

Regarding Nobusuke Kishi's visit to Taiwan and his statement in Taiwan supporting Chiang Kai-shek's "recovery of the mainland," Premier Zhou Enlai said that after the establishment of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, it was a good thing for him to visit Asian countries as a member of Asian and African countries. Given Japan's current position, it is understandable that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi may not visit China for the time being. But he went to Taiwan. Nobusuke Kishi did things that Hatoyama, Ishibashi, and Yoshida had never done, which is extremely repulsive to the Chinese people. Not only that, but according to a report by Asahi Shimbun on June 4, Nobusuke Kishi said to Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan: "If it is possible to recover the mainland, I think it would be very good." Obviously, this means that Nobusuke Kishi supports Chiang Kai-shek's "recovery of the mainland," which is Nobusuke Kishi's manifestation of openly antagonizing 600 million Chinese people at all costs.

Premier Zhou Enlai refuted Nobusuke Kishi's slanderous remarks about China during his visit to the United States. According to an Associated Press report from Denver on July 4, Nobusuke Kishi told American reporters, "The Chinese Communist Party will try to infiltrate the entire Asia."

Premier Zhou Enlai said that it is understandable that Japan is under the control of the United States today and that Nobusuke Kishi visited the United States. We do not object to Japan's friendship with the United States. We advocate that all countries should be friendly to each other and should not be hostile to each other. The problem is that Nobusuke Kishi ran to the United States and slandered New China to please his American masters.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that many facts have proved that we are willing to live in peace with Asian countries. We have also repeatedly said that after our country and Japan restore normal relations, China and Japan can sign a treaty of friendship and non-aggression. Chairman Mao Zedong and I pointed out in our talks with the Japanese Socialist Party delegation that as long as Japan cancels the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the United States cancels its military bases in Japan and withdraws U.S. troops from Japan, so that Japan can gain complete independence, then the clauses in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance aimed at preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism and being used by others can be revised.

We have said these things, but the Japanese government does not use these facts as a basis. On the contrary, Nobusuke Kishi made slanderous remarks about our country in the United States, regardless of the facts. This is something we deeply regret.

Premier Zhou Enlai then refuted Nobusuke Kishi's remarks during his visit to India, which provoked Sino-Indian relations. According to a report by the Press Trust of India from New Delhi on May 24, Nobusuke Kishi once said, "The People's Republic of China is not a member of the United Nations, but an aggressor country, and this resolution is still valid. For this reason, we cannot recognize Communist China."

India believes that China is a trustworthy friend, but Nobusuke Kishi went to provoke Sino-Indian relations.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's remarks in India are ridiculous. India supports New China's restoration of its position in the United Nations. India believes that China is a trustworthy friend. Nobusuke Kishi's provocation of Sino-Indian relations to India is a very unfriendly act. During my visit to eight Asian countries, I contacted some Japanese envoys stationed in those countries and told them that Japan should be friendly with Asian countries, and also advised Southeast Asian countries to be friendly with Japan. This was done in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference. However, the Japanese Prime Minister is not like this. Not only does he not recognize China, but he also runs to another country to slander China and provoke that country's relations with China. The Japanese Socialist Party is not like this. They advocate recognizing New China and opposing the conspiracy of creating two Chinas. The Socialist Party is a political party, and the Liberal Democratic Party is also a political party. There are also people within the Liberal Democratic Party who advocate recognizing New China. We wonder why Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi takes this attitude?

Sino-Japanese trade will have greater development, but the Japanese government wants to undermine the establishment of trade representative offices.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the Japanese government's requirement for Chinese trade representatives to provide fingerprints is an insult to our country. He said: Sino-Japanese trade is developing and will have greater development in the future. We are even considering signing long-term trade contracts with relevant parties in Japan.

For the economic development of China and Japan, Sino-Japanese trade should be developed better. Only in this way can we achieve peace, friendship, and true co-existence and co-prosperity. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government has always failed to support the mutual establishment of non-governmental commercial representative offices stipulated in the third Sino-Japanese trade agreement, and emphasized that our representatives should provide fingerprints, making the trade delegation informal. This is an insult to our country and is actually undermining the establishment of trade representative offices. As for our country, we have never considered attaching any conditions to the establishment of a Japanese trade representative office.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said that we support the Japanese people's peaceful appeals, which is entirely out of the goodwill of the Chinese people. However, the Japanese government has imposed four unreasonable restrictions on the delegation of our people participating in the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament. This is not the attitude of treating guests, but a hostile and distrustful approach.

The so-called issue of "missing" Japanese is a sudden and unfriendly act.

When talking about the Japanese government's request to investigate the so-called "missing" Japanese people, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Japanese government, through the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, raised the issue of investigating the so-called "missing" 35,000 Japanese people to our Consul General in Geneva. Then, Hirose Masao, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, sent me two telegrams requesting to send a semi-official delegation to investigate the so-called "missing" Japanese. This is a sudden and unfriendly action. We have dealt with the issue of Japanese nationals and are still dealing with it. According to international practice, these matters should be resolved after the restoration of diplomatic relations. However, we did not adhere to this international practice, and solved it through the efforts of the three Japanese organizations and the Chinese Red Cross while China and Japan were still in a state of war. Among the approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals in China, more than 29,000 have returned to Japan with the assistance of the Chinese Red Cross, and the number of former Japanese soldiers who have committed various crimes and war criminals who have been exempted from prosecution has not been included. This September, eight more war criminals who have served their sentences and those who have been released early due to old age and illness will be released.

The three Japanese organizations sent the remains of overseas Chinese, wives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs in Japan back to China, which is something we are grateful for. In the future, if any Japanese nationals in China request to return to their country, the Chinese Red Cross will continue to provide assistance. The above statement does not preclude the Japanese people from inquiring with the Chinese Red Cross about the situation of Japanese nationals in China and the remains of Japanese who died in China.

Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that the Japanese government is not doing things that are beneficial to Sino-Japanese friendship, but instead raises this fabricated issue, which is of no benefit to Sino-Japanese friendship.

Premier Zhou Enlai finally said that the above facts make us unable to but suspect that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is deliberately making things difficult for China, provoking relations between Asian countries and China, and slandering China to please the United States in order to obtain US assistance, carry out rearmament, and revive militarism. We hope that Japan can get rid of US control and restore normal Sino-Japanese relations as soon as possible. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's approach is contrary to our wishes. Of course, we always believe that the Japanese people are willing to be friendly with China.

    周恩来总理同日本记者谈中日关系
    中国人民愿意同日本人民友好
    指责岸信介敌视中国，挑拨亚洲国家同中国的关系
    新华社29日讯　周恩来总理在7月25日接见以田尻正泰为首的日本民间广播联盟代表团和日本共同社、朝日新闻记者的时候，向他们就中日关系发表了谈话。
    周恩来总理说，中国人民在战后是愿意同日本人民友好的。这从解放后八年来中国方面所作的努力可以看出来。另一方面，从我们同访问中国的日本朋友的接触中，从日本人民在日本国内的活动看来，日本人民也是愿意同中国人民友好的。这两者就是发展中日友好关系的基本条件。根据两国人民友好的愿望，彼此的来往日趋频繁了。日本朋友在和中国人民的接触中，也可以感觉到中国人民愿意把过去曾经有过的不愉快的关系逐渐地淡薄下去，在将近两千年来彼此友好的基础上发展新的友好关系。这不仅是可能的，而且现实性也一天天在增大。
    两国人民的友好活动和签订民间性协议，大大发展了两国关系
    周恩来总理指出，最近几年来，中日两国很多民间团体、半官方团体签订了不少的协议，这些协议大多数已经在实行。尽管中日两国还没有恢复正常关系，而且按照国际法还存在着战争状态，但是这些并没有妨碍两国人民的友好活动和签订民间性的协议。这样先从民间的频繁来往并且达成协议开始，把两国的关系大大发展，最后就剩下在外交上宣布结束战争状态，恢复正常关系了。
    周恩来总理说，我们这样的作法，可以说是在国际关系史上创造了新的范例。我们是抱着这样愉快的有希望的心情来进行国民外交的，我们把国民外交看成是我们整个外交的重要组成部分。我希望日本朋友也能够这样来看。
    周恩来总理说，我的这种看法在许多日本朋友中得到了共鸣。至于日本政府方面，我们就要进行具体的分析了。吉田前首相是敌视中国的，因此就说不上有什么友好的愿望。但是鸠山、石桥两位前首相是有这种愿望的。至于岸信介首相，他本来应该更进一步地表明这种愿望，但是事实证明，岸信介内阁反而比鸠山、石桥两内阁后退了。
    周恩来总理接着举出岸信介内阁成立后的一些敌视中国、挑拨亚洲国家和中国关系的事例，并且逐一加以驳斥。
    岸信介支持蒋介石“收复大陆”引起中国人民的极大反感
    关于岸信介到台湾去和在台湾发表支持蒋介石“收复大陆”的谈话，周恩来总理说，岸信介内阁成立后，作为亚非国家的成员之一，他去访问亚洲国家本来是很好的。以日本今天所处的地位，岸信介首相暂时不来中国访问，是可以谅解的。但是他却到台湾去了。岸信介作了鸠山、石桥、吉田所没有作过的事，这是中国人民极为反感的。不仅如此，而且据朝日新闻6月4日报道，岸信介在台湾曾对蒋介石说：“如果能够收复大陆的话，我认为是非常好的”。很明显，这就是说岸信介支持蒋介石“收复大陆”，这就是岸信介不惜公开地敌视六万万中国人民的表现。
    周恩来总理驳斥了岸信介在访问美国的时候，发表的诬蔑中国的谈话，据美联社7月4日从丹佛报道，岸信介对美国记者说，“中国共产党将试图渗入整个亚洲”。
    周恩来总理说，日本今天处于美国控制之下，岸信介到美国去访问是可以理解的。日本同美国友好我们并不反对。我们主张一切国家都应该互相友好而不应该互相敌视。问题是在于岸信介跑到美国去却拿诬蔑新中国讨美国主人的欢心。
    周恩来总理说，很多事实证明，我们是愿意同亚洲各国和平相处的。我们也屡次说过，在我国和日本恢复了正常关系以后，中国和日本就可以签订互不侵犯的友好条约。毛泽东主席和我在同日本社会党代表团的谈话中都指出，只要日本取消日美安全条约和美国取消在日本的军事基地，并且从日本撤出美国驻军，使日本能够获得完全独立，那么，中苏友好同盟互助条约中关于以防止日本军国主义的再起和被人利用为目的的条款是可以修改的。
    这些话我们都说过，但是日本政府不把这些事实作为依据。相反地岸信介却不顾事实地在美国发表诬蔑我国的言论。这是我们深深引为遗憾的。
    周恩来总理接着驳斥了岸信介在访问印度时候发表的挑拨中印关系的谈话。据印度报业托拉斯5月24日从新德里报道，岸信介曾经发表谈话说，“中华人民共和国在联合国不是会员国，而是侵略国，这一决议仍然有效。由于这个理由，我们不能承认共产党中国。”
    印度认为中国是可以信任的友邦岸信介却跑去挑拨中印关系
    周恩来总理指出，岸信介在印度发表的这次谈话是很可笑的。印度是支持新中国恢复在联合国地位的。印度认为中国是可以信任的友邦。岸信介却对印度挑拨中印关系，这是非常不友好的表现。我在访问八个亚洲国家的时候，曾经对日本驻在那些国家中的某些使节进行了接触，并且和他们说，日本应该同亚洲各国友好，并且也劝说东南亚各国也同日本友好。这是根据万隆会议的原则作的。可是日本首相却不是这样。他不但不承认中国，却还要跑到另一个国家去诬蔑中国，挑拨那个国家同中国的关系。日本社会党就不是这样，他们主张承认新中国，反对搞两个中国的阴谋。社会党是一个党派，自由民主党也是一个党派。自由民主党内也有人主张承认新中国。我们怀疑岸信介首相为什么采取这种态度？
    中日贸易将会有更大的发展，日本政府却想破坏通商代表团的设立
    周恩来总理指出日本政府要中国贸易代表按手印是对我国的侮辱。他说：中日贸易正在发展，将来还会有更大的发展。我们甚至考虑同日本有关方面签订长期贸易合同。
   为了中日两国经济的发展，中日贸易应该发展得更好。这样才能做到和平友好，达到真正的共存共荣。但是岸信介政府对第三次中日贸易协定所规定的互设民间商务代表机构问题始终不予支持，强调要我们的代表打手印，使通商代表团变成非正式的。这是对我国的侮辱，实际上是破坏通商代表团的设立。至于我国，我们从未设想过对日本通商代表团的设立附加任何条件。
    周恩来总理又说，我们支持日本人民的和平呼吁，这完全是出自中国人民的好意。但是，日本政府对参加禁止原子弹、氢弹争取裁军的世界大会的我国人民的代表团却提出四条无理限制。这不是对待客人的态度，而是敌对的不信任的作法。
    所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题是一个突然而来的不友好行为
    在谈到关于日本政府提出的调查所谓“下落不明”的日本人的问题的时候，周恩来总理说，日本政府通过日本驻日内瓦总领事向我国驻日内瓦总领事提出了调查所谓“下落不明”的三万五千名日本人的问题。接着日本众议院议员广濑正雄氏又两次给我来电，要求派一个半官方的代表团来调查所谓“行踪不明”的日本人。这是一个突然而来的不友好的行动。对日本侨民问题，我们已经进行了处理而且还在处理。按照国际惯例，这些事情是应该在恢复邦交以后才能解决的。但是，我们没有拘泥于这一国际惯例，而在中日两国还存在着战争状态的情况下，就通过日本三团体和中国红十字会的努力加以解决。三万五千人左右的在华日侨中，经中国红十字会的协助返回日本的已经达到二万九千多人，犯有各种罪行的前日本军人和免予起诉的战争犯罪者一千五百多名的回国数目还未计算在内。今年9月间，还有八名满刑的和年老多病提前释放的战犯将被释放。
    日本三团体把华侨、华侨妻子以及在日本的中国抗日烈士的遗骨送回中国，这是值得我们感谢的。今后在华日侨如有要求回国的，中国红十字会仍将继续予以协助。上述说法并不排除日本人民向中国红十字会了解关于在华日侨和死在中国的日本人遗骨的情况。
    周恩来总理着重说，日本政府对于有利于中日友好的事情不作，却提出了这个无中生有的问题，这对中日友好是毫无好处的。
    周恩来总理最后说，上述这些事实使我们不能不怀疑岸信介首相是故意同中国为难，挑拨亚洲国家和中国的关系，拿诬蔑中国来讨好美国，以便取得美国的援助，进行重新武装，复活军国主义。我们希望日本能够摆脱美国的控制，早日恢复中日正常关系。岸信介首相的作法是同我们的愿望相反的。当然我们始终相信日本人民是愿意中日友好的。
