Xinhua News Agency Report: Kong Xiangming, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Lankao County Committee in Henan Province and Secretary of the CPC Hongmiao Township Committee, gloriously sacrificed himself on the evening of the 10th while eliminating flood damage and stopping backflow in Hongmiaozhai. On the 10th, Lankao County experienced torrential rain. Hongmiaozhai, with a population of more than 8,000, is located a little more than half a kilometer north of the old course of the Yellow River, and was surrounded by water on the east, west, and south sides, a scene of vast expanse. The water flowed along the road, pouring north through a single-arch bridge, but because the ditch north of the bridge was silted up, it could not flow smoothly into the river channel. The water level gradually rose, and Hongmiaozhai was in danger of being submerged. The masses were extremely nervous. At this critical moment, Kong Xiangming decided to first block the bridge opening with door panels, and then organize forces to rush to clear the ditch, so that the rushing water could flow north into the river. So, he and two Party members and one Youth League member sailed on door panels (there were no boats in the area) to the bridgehead to block the water. Unexpectedly, the water was too swift. Just as they reached the bridgehead, the door panels were overturned by the water. The other three were washed out of the bridge opening and rescued, but Kong Xiangming was trapped under the bridge by the door panel. Rescue attempts failed, and he finally sacrificed himself.

The news of Kong Xiangming's sacrifice caused grief among cadres and the masses throughout the county. On the day of the burial, more than 1,500 agricultural co-op members held a memorial meeting.

    共产党员孔祥明堵塞逆流光荣牺牲
    据新华社讯  中共河南省兰考县委农村工作部副部长兼中共红庙乡委员会书记孔祥明，10日晚上在红庙砦排除水患、堵塞逆流中，不幸光荣牺牲。10日，兰考县一带暴雨。有八千多人口的红庙砦，北距黄河故道一里多远，东、西、南三面积水，一片汪洋。水流顺着公路，经过独孔桥向北倾泄，但因桥北水沟淤塞，不能顺利流入河道，水位逐渐上涨，红庙砦眼看有被淹没的可能，群众紧张万分。在这紧急关头，孔祥明决定先用门板将桥孔堵住，然后组织力量突击疏通水沟，让急水北流入河。于是，他同两个党员、一个团员划着门板（这一带没有船）前往桥头堵水，不料水势过急，刚到桥头，门板被水冲翻，另三人被水从桥眼冲出得救；孔祥明却被门板卡在桥下，抢救未成，终于牺牲。
    孔祥明牺牲的消息传出后，全县干部和群众无不悲痛。埋葬的那天，有一千五百多农业社员开了追悼大会。
