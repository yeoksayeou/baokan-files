Absolutely Do Not Let Rightist Elements Within the Party Corrode the Party's Fabric
Openly Opposing the Party's Counterattack Against Rightist Elements
Xu Liangying's Soul is Permeated with Rightist Thought

    (Our dispatch) The entire staff of the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of the Party, has recently exposed and criticized the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Xu Liangying, a rightist element and Communist Party member of the institute.

    During the initial stage of the Great Rectification, Xu Liangying released many inflammatory remarks. He said: "The first stage of the rectification is mainly to let everyone vent their grievances"; "Venting grievances is the first step in demolishing the wall." And he said, "Anyway, after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, everyone can be treated equally," meaning that there is no need for any class line or distinction between those inside and outside the Party. Holding this thought and ulterior motives, he waved the banner of the Great Rectification to light fires everywhere, spread anti-Party remarks, and even said that "such airing of views is in the highest interest of the Party."

    Xu Liangying believed that the early European bourgeois revolution had many good things, such as freedom, equality, fraternity, individual liberation, etc., which are worthy of our inheritance. And he believed that only by inheriting bourgeois democracy can we "enable socialist countries not only economically, but also culturally and ideologically, to rapidly catch up with capitalist countries." He said that this was his "understanding" after studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. And he went everywhere to promote bourgeois democracy and freedom. He once said to a comrade from the Science Publishing House that "the old bourgeois democracy was good, and the reason why the Stalin incident occurred in the Soviet Union was because of a lack of bourgeois democracy."

    During the Great Rectification, he felt that Wenhui Bao was the most satisfying, because "Wenhui Bao exposed things most thoroughly." As for the People's Daily, he didn't want to read it anymore because it was "too crude" in its counterattack against the rightists.

    The full exposure of this rightist element's anti-Party and anti-socialist true face came after the Party Central Committee issued the battle call to counterattack the rightist elements' offensive.

    After the People's Daily editorial was published on June 8th, Xu Liangying openly launched a vicious attack on the Party at a meeting of the Party member backbone group in the institute on June 13th. He said that the publication of such an editorial by the People's Daily meant that the rectification movement would not be carried out, which he felt was "very regrettable." He believed that the People's Daily's counterattack against the rightist offensive was "making people feel that yesterday they were all smiles, but today suddenly their faces changed, which is immoral and lacks even basic democracy, too crude." He also said, "From the words and deeds of Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, and others, one cannot see anything against socialism; they are merely expressing opinions on behalf of the bourgeoisie." He believed that Zhang Bojun's saying that a Hungarian incident was about to occur now, and that the Party should make concessions, was very correct. He also told people that the whole country was about to make a big push, and incited people to engage in anti-socialist activities. He believed that the People's Daily's use of large characters to highlight the words of the rightist elements was "creating divisions within the people," and that "a full-scale counterattack in eight pages is not a gentle and mild rectification." He also questioned the People's Daily: "Why do you do it this way? Rectification cannot be carried out this way, and rectification is just empty talk." He said: "To give Chu Anping, the only one who offered suggestions to Chairman Mao, a double blow is too crude." He also slandered by saying: "The counterattack against the rightist elements may be that Chairman Mao's policy was opposed by senior cadres with sectarianism within the Party, and thus there was a change, Chairman Mao compromised, and this is the old cadres wanting to retaliate; it is too immoral." He also spread rumors that: "The Central Committee is split. Liu Shaoqi and Peng Zhen are suppressing Chairman Mao," and pretended to be an upright gentleman, declaring: "I will stand up to defend Chairman Mao's line, even at the cost of sacrificing my Party membership and abandoning my children and family." He once went to the Science Publishing House to ask a comrade if he agreed with the views of the People's Daily editorial. When that comrade replied that he agreed, he immediately scolded him, saying: "A worthless intellectual, with no reaction to this." Later, he also told others, "This person has been taken over by the Party branch."

    In a very short period of a few days, he traveled to eight or nine places in and out of the city, found more than a dozen people, and carried out considerable activities. However, he has confessed very little about these activities, apart from what the comrades have exposed.

    Regarding his reactionary thoughts and criminal activities, the entire comrades of the Institute of Philosophy are currently further exposing, criticizing, and investigating.

    决不让党内右派分子腐蚀党的肌体
    公然反对党对右派分子的反击
    许良英的灵魂浸透了右派思想
    本报讯　中国科学院哲学研究所全体工作人员在党的领导下，于最近期间揭露并批判了该所右派分子共产党员许良英的反党、反社会主义的言论和行动。
    在开始大鸣大放期间，许良英放出了许多煽动性的言论。他说：“整风的第一阶段主要是让大家吐吐怨气”；“发牢骚是拆墙的第一步”。并且说：“反正大家经过肃反，都可以一视同仁”，就是说不需要什么阶级路线和党内外的界线了。他持着这种思想和不可告人的目的，打着大鸣大放的旗子到处点火，散播反党言论，还说“这样的鸣放是党的最高利益”。
    许良英认为欧洲资产阶级革命初期有许多好的东西，如自由、平等、博爱、个性解放等等，值得我们继承。并认为只有继承了资产阶级的民主，才能“使社会主义国家不仅在经济上，而且在文化上、思想上能迅速赶过资本主义国家。”他说这是他学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话后的“心得”。并到处宣扬资产阶级的民主和自由。他曾经对科学出版社的一位同志说“资产阶级旧民主好，苏联所以发生斯大林事件就是因为缺乏资产阶级民主”。
    在大鸣大放期间，他觉得文汇报最过瘾，因为“文汇报揭发得最彻底。”对人民日报则因为它反击右派“太粗暴”，所以他不愿再看了。
    这个右派分子反党反社会主义的真面目的充分暴露，还是在党中央提出反击右派分子进攻的战斗号召之后。
    6月8日人民日报社论发表以后，许良英在6月13日该所党员骨干小组会上公开地发动了对党的恶毒进攻。他说人民日报发表这样的社论，就是说整风运动不搞了，他觉得“很可惜”。他认为人民日报对右派进攻发动了反击是“使人感到昨天还是笑嘻嘻的，今天突然变了脸，不道德，连起码的民主也没有，太粗暴了。”又说，“从章伯钧、章乃器、储安平等人的言行中看不出反对社会主义的东西；他们只不过是代表资产阶级发表意见而已”。他认为章伯钧说现在要出匈牙利事件了，党应该让步，这话很对。他也对人说现在全国要大搞了，并煽动人进行反社会主义的活动。他认为人民日报将右派分子的话用大字标出是“制造人民内部的分裂”，“八个版全面反击不是和风细雨的整风”。他还质问人民日报：“为什么要这样搞法？这样整风就搞不好，要整风也是讲空话。”他说：“给唯一向毛主席提意见的储安平以双倍打击，是太粗暴了。”他还污蔑说：“对右派分子发动了反击可能是毛主席的方针受到了党内有宗派主义的高级干部的反对，因而有了转变，毛主席妥协了，这是老干部想报复；太不道德了。”他还造谣说：“中央分裂了。刘少奇彭真压制毛主席”并且装做正人君子的面孔声言：“我要起来捍卫毛主席的路线，不惜牺牲党籍，丢开孩子和家庭。”他曾经去科学出版社问一个同志是否同意人民日报社论的看法，那位同志回答他说同意，他立即骂人家说：没出息的知识分子，对这个都没有反应。后来还对别人说，“这个人被党支部搞过去了”。
    在很短的几天中，他城里城外奔走过八九个地方，找过十几个人，进行了不少的活动。但对于这些活动，除了同志们揭露的之外，他自己还很少交代。
    关于他的反动思想和罪恶活动，目前哲学研究所的全体同志，正在进一步进行揭露批判和追查。
