Several Suggestions on the Study of Modern Chinese History
He Sui's Speech

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report and all other reports.

In the past two years, I have inspected various regions, including the Northeast, East China, Central South, and Northwest. Everywhere I went, I saw that the people were well-fed and clothed, living in peace and contentment. Even in Dunhuang, a place beyond the Great Wall, the situation was the same. This is an unprecedented achievement in history. The people support the government and love the Party. The right-wingers' anti-Party fallacies that the people's lives have not improved are simply blatant lies!

Now, I would like to offer some suggestions regarding the study of modern Chinese history. I am a layman when it comes to history. However, during my inspection, I heard some feedback and have some of my own opinions to share for your reference and correction.

Avoid "Valuing the Past and Devaluing the Present"

First, in our historical circles, there has always been a tendency to "value the past and devalue the present," especially when it comes to modern history, which is often seen as "news," and historians are often unwilling to engage in it. Therefore, the study of modern history has become a very weak link in our historical science. This fact has already attracted the attention of historical circles. In 1953, Mr. Liu Danian pointed out in his report "The Current Situation of Chinese History" in the Soviet Union that in the future, it is necessary to "focus on the study of modern Chinese history, especially the history of the last thirty years." However, upon actual investigation, in recent years, the state of research on modern Chinese history has not made significant progress. Up to now, many university research groups engaged in modern history teaching still do not have a clear understanding of the history of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Historically, these aspects have only been explored as background information for revolutionary history. Therefore, apart from a general conclusion, few people have truly made the effort to collect and explore specific historical materials in these areas. For example, the Wuhan East Lake History Museum, which I inspected this March, lacked historical materials on the Wuchang Uprising, even though Wuchang is the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution. Furthermore, for a considerable period of time, anyone who talked too much about the historical materials of the Kuomintang was considered to have ideological problems. This one-sided view affected the more comprehensive and rapid development of modern history research.

Modern Chinese history actually has two aspects: one is the history of the people's revolutionary struggle against the three major enemies and their victory; the other is the history of imperialism and the domestic ruling class moving from suppressing the revolutionary struggle to collapse. The former is definitely the main aspect, but if we do not have a clear understanding of the history of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang rule, how can we truly understand the overall picture of the development of modern Chinese society? How can we truly understand some of the basic principles of revolutionary history? I suggest that historians should be called upon to work hard in this area, actively collect historical materials, and then compile a more complete "Modern Chinese History."

Strengthen Data Work

Second, data is the "air" of scientific research. Many university professors are suffering from a lack of data and are afraid to publish research articles. I suggest:

1.  Modern history is not like ancient history. Many people of our age have experienced history firsthand. For example, many of the representatives present here participated in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and some major historical events before and after that. I think that in order to let our descendants better understand the face of this era, the elderly who have personally experienced some historical events should write down and publish their experiences and insights without reservation for historians to study (Representative Li Liuru's "Sixty Years of Changes" is a good example).

2.  The work of compiling and publishing modern historical materials should be strengthened. A lot of historical books have been published in the past; but the quantity is small, not valued, and cannot meet the needs of research work in various places. I think that some out-of-print books that are indeed of reference value (such as Mèn Shī Tán Hǔ Kè's "Modern Chinese Secret History" and Tao Juyin's series) should be selected, sorted, and republished.

3.  Many historical events are regional in nature. For example, Wuchang is the place where the Xinhai Revolution first broke out, and the National Protection War has the greatest relationship with Yunnan. In fact, almost every place has its own special historical materials. These materials are more difficult for people from other places to investigate and sort out. Moreover, there are some elderly people in various places who are familiar with local history and anecdotes, many of whom do not have the ability and energy to write. Therefore, I suggest that the history departments of universities distributed in various places should extract strength to separately investigate and sort out local historical materials.

4.  At Sun Yat-sen University, Wuhan University, and Xi'an Normal College, I heard such an opinion: that the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has gathered a considerable amount of material, but lacks people to sort it out, while the history departments of universities in various places have people and more time, but lack materials. This contradiction needs to be resolved. It is hoped that the materials can be distributed according to region for everyone to sort out. I think this is a very good opinion.

Strengthen Human Resources

Third, scientific research requires people to do it. It is understood that there are very few professors in various universities who can truly engage in modern history research. One professor who teaches modern history said: "As long as manpower is equipped, and given time and necessary data, things can be produced." Indeed, it is difficult to achieve great results if human resources are not strengthened. I suggest that the history departments of universities with the necessary conditions can set up independent modern history research institutions, which will also be conducive to cultivating young historical workers.

Finally, I feel that in recent years, the field of modern history seems to be a bit lonely, because modern history involves many basic issues of the revolution, and the concerns about "contention" may be greater. I earnestly hope that under the shining of the correct policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the field of modern Chinese history can also achieve "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

### 对中国现代史研究的几点建议  何遂的发言

    对中国现代史研究的几点建议
    何遂的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的报告和其他各项报告。
    近两年中，我去过东北、华东、中南、西北各地视察，处处看到人民生活都是丰衣足食，安居乐业，连塞外的敦煌也是一样，这是历史上的空前伟绩。人民都是拥护政府、热爱党的。右派分子所说人民生活没有改善的反党谬论，真是睁着眼睛说瞎话！
    现在我就中国现代史研究方面提几点建议。我对于历史，是一个门外汉，这次视察听到一些反映，自己也有一些意见，提出来供大家参考，请予指正。
    不可“贵古贱今”
    第一，我国史学界一向有“贵古贱今”的风气，尤其是对现代史，被视为“新闻”，史学家多不愿搞这一套。因此，现代史的研究就成为我国历史科学中很薄弱的一环。这个事实已经引起了史学界的注意。一九五三年刘大年先生在苏联所作“中国历史的现状”的报告中，即已指出：今后要“着重进行中国近代史的研究，特别是要研究近三十年的历史”。但实际考察一下，这几年来，中国现代史研究的状况，并无显著进展。迄至目前，许多大学搞现代史的教研组，对北洋军阀及国民党统治区的历史，仍是摸不清楚。向来，这些方面，只是作为讲革命史的背景而提出探讨的。所以除了一个概括的结论外，很少有人真正下功夫去搜集、摸索这方面的具体史料。以我今年三月视察过的武昌东湖历史博物馆来说，武昌是辛亥革命发源地，这一段史料竟付缺如。甚至在相当长的一个时期中，谁要多讲了些国民党方面的史料，便被认为思想上有问题，这样片面的看法影响着现代史研究更全面和更迅速的开展。
    中国现代历史，实际上存在着两个方面：一方面是人民大众反抗三大敌人革命斗争取得胜利的历史；另一方面是帝国主义和国内统治阶级从镇压革命斗争走向崩溃的历史。前一方面肯定是主要的一方面，但是如果对北洋军阀及国民党统治的历史弄不清楚，又怎能真正了解现代中国社会发展的全貌？怎能真正弄清革命史中的一些基本道理呢？我建议：史学界应号召史学家们努力作这方面的钻研，积极的收集史料，进而编写一部更完整的“中国现代史”。
    加强资料工作
    第二，资料是科学研究的“空气”，许多大学的先生们都苦于资料不足，不敢发表研究文章。我建议：
    1、现代史不比古代史，有许多像我们这样年纪的人，都曾经是历史过来人，譬如在座的许多代表就是曾参加过一九一一年辛亥革命和以前及以后的某些重大历史事件。我想，为了让我们的子孙后代，更好地了解这一时代的面貌，我们曾经亲历过一些历史事件的老年人，应该把自己的见闻经历，毫无保留地写出来，发表出来，供给史学家研究（李六如代表的“六十年的变迁”即是一个好例）。
    2、应加强现代史资料的整理、出版工作。过去出版过不少史料书；但数量不大，不被珍视，不能满足各地研究工作的需要。我想，一些确有参考价值的绝版书（如扪虱谈虎客的“近代中国秘史”，陶菊隐丛书等），应该予以选择整理重新出版。
    3、有许多历史事件是带有地域性的，如武昌是辛亥革命首义的地方，又如护国战争与云南的关系最大。事实上，各地几乎都有其特殊的历史资料。这些资料，外地的人是较难调查整理的。而且各地都有一些熟悉当地历史掌故的老年人，其中不少自己没有能力和精力去编写。因此，我建议：分布在各地大学的历史系应该抽出力量来，分别地进行调查整理当地史料。
    4、我在中山大学、武汉大学及西安师范学院等处，听到这样一条意见：即科学院历史研究所第三所集中了数量可观的材料，但缺乏人去整理，而各地大学历史系有人也较有时间，就是缺乏材料，这个矛盾需要解决。希望能把材料按地区分下去，大家来整理。我觉得这是一个很好的意见。
    加强人力配备
    第三，科学研究是要人去搞的，据了解，目前各大学真正能搞现代史研究工作的先生们是很少的，有一位教现代史的先生说：“只要配备人力，给予时间和必要的资料，就能搞出东西来。”的确，如不加强人力配备，是很难获得很大成果的。我建议：各个有条件的大学历史系，可附设现代史研究的独立机构，这样也有利于培养青年的史学工作者。
    最后，我感到，近年来，现代史的园地似乎嫌寂寞了一点，因为现代史涉及到许多革命的基本问题，“争鸣”的顾虑可能大一些。我热切地希望在党中央和毛主席这一正确方针的照耀下，中国现代史的园地也能作到“百花齐放，百家争鸣”。
