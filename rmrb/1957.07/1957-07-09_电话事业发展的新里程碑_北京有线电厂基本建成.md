    New Milestone in the Development of Telephone Industry
    Basic Completion of Beijing Wired Electric Plant

    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The factory building of China's first modern automatic telephone exchange manufacturing plant—the Beijing Wired Electric Plant—has recently been completed, and the main equipment installation project has also been completed. Most of the workshops are currently undergoing product trial production and will be fully put into production in September this year.
    Automatic telephone exchanges could not be manufactured at all in old China and relied entirely on imports from abroad. The completion of the Beijing Wired Electric Plant marks a new milestone in the development of China's telephone industry. The production process of this factory is highly mechanized and automated.
    The automatic telephone exchanges produced will also be the latest telecommunications equipment. According to the designed capacity, the automatic telephone exchanges produced by this factory in three years will be equivalent to the total amount imported from foreign countries in the past few decades.
    Manufacturing automatic telephone exchanges involves a very complex process. A ordinary exchange needs to be assembled from 500,000 to 5 million parts. Some parts are as delicate and accurate as clock parts. Therefore, the process requirements are very strict when manufacturing and assembling products in this factory.
    The Beijing Wired Electric Plant was built with the assistance of the Soviet government. Soviet experts integrated the advantages of many exchange manufacturing plants in their country and provided all the technical design data for this factory. The main equipment and precision machines are also supplied by the Soviet Union. During the construction of this factory, the Soviet government sent many construction technical supervision experts, equipment installation experts, and experts in mastering product production to help with the work.

    电话事业发展的新里程碑
    北京有线电厂基本建成
    据新华社7日讯　我国第一座现代化的生产自动电话交换机的工厂——北京有线电厂的厂房最近建成，主要设备安装工程也已经完工，目前大部分车间正在进行产品试制，今年9月份就将全面投入生产。
    自动电话交换机在旧中国根本不能制造，都是依靠从国外进口。北京有线电厂的建成，是我国电话事业发展的新的里程碑。这座工厂的生产过程，是高度机械化和自动化的。
    生产出来的自动电话交换机也将是最新式的电讯设备。按照设计能力，这个厂三年所生产的自动电话交换机，就相当于我国过去几十年从外国进口数量的总和。
    制造自动电话交换机要经过非常复杂的过程。一部普通的交换机要由五十万到五百万个零件装配起来。有的零件像钟表零件一样精巧和准确。因此这个厂在制造和装配产品的时候，工艺要求十分严格。
    北京有线电厂是在苏联政府的帮助下建成的。苏联专家们综合了本国许多生产交换机工厂的优点，提供了这个厂全部的技术设计资料。主要设备和精密的机器也是由苏联供应的。在这个厂建设过程中，苏联政府派来许多施工技术监督专家、设备安装专家和掌握产品生产的专家帮助工作。
