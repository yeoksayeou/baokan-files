I fully endorse Premier Zhou’s and the Central Committee leaders' work reports.

I came to this conference from the Huai River control construction site at the Xianghongdian Reservoir. During this conference, after studying Chairman Mao's article on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, I felt particularly enlightened. I realized the importance of correctly distinguishing between the two different types of contradictions, and that different methods should be adopted to deal with different types of contradictions. I believe that Chairman Mao's current emphasis on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is aimed at better uniting the more than 600 million people across the country to advance on the road of socialism. This is a self-evident truth. However, before I came to Beijing, I saw in the newspapers on the Xianghongdian Reservoir construction site that right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Huang Shaohong, Long Yun, and Tan Tiwu published absurd remarks that slandered the Party, opposed the Party, harbored animosity towards the socialist system, and attempted to undermine the flesh-and-blood ties between the Party and the people. They wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style and handle contradictions among the people to launch ulterior attacks on the Party and the working class. This made me extremely angry. I could no longer suppress the anger in my heart, and I had to say a few words.

I am an old worker, and I am already fifty-eight years old this year. In the dark society before liberation, because my family was poor, my father took me to work as an apprentice in a capitalist's factory from a young age. In order to earn a living, I was often beaten and scolded, and I couldn't eat enough or wear warm clothes. Later, after I finished my apprenticeship and became a formal worker, my monthly salary was only three yuan. We workers still ate boiled cabbage with clear water, lived in low thatched houses that we could only enter by bending over, and wore patched and mended clothes, living a life like cattle and horses, and were constantly threatened by unemployment. As for our political status as workers, there was no question of it. I remember working in Shanghai before liberation, and it was not permissible to even stand near the Grand Theatre, let alone watch a movie. Also, as everyone remembers, there was a sign hanging on the gate of a park in Shanghai that read: "Chinese and dogs not allowed." Not only we workers, but even the Chinese people were insulted. All of this, not only we workers, we patriotic adults must remember, but also the next generation growing up in the happy socialist environment must firmly remember it.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we workers were completely liberated. We have no worries about food or clothing, live in workers' dormitories, and enjoy labor insurance benefits. Workers receive care when they are sick and when raising children. Some worker families with too many people also receive long-term or short-term living allowances. Workers are no longer threatened by unemployment, and no one rides on our heads to act like overlords. In short, in a word, the Communist Party has come, and the benefits are endless. But today's right-wing elements are closing their eyes and talking nonsense. They insist that "the people's lives have not improved, and are now worse than before liberation," and so on. I cannot help but question those right-wing gentlemen, what else can you explain other than to show that you are deliberately inciting the people to leave the Communist Party by reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white?

In the eight years since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, our country has achieved a series of brilliant achievements in the cause of opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace; in eliminating exploitation and poverty and building socialism; in cultural and educational undertakings; in transportation; in land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea; in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other movements. Isn't this an unprecedented great achievement? Take the great water conservancy projects such as the Foziling Reservoir, the Meishan Reservoir, and the Xianghongdian Reservoir, which I personally participated in building, for example. Many of the delegates may have visited them. They are famous not only domestically but also internationally. These projects have undergone many major flood tests. Take last year's flood season, for example. More than 1,000 millimeters of rain fell in the Huaibei area, and the Huai River flooded. If the rainfall of the entire flood season is calculated, it was similar to 1954. Because of the role of a series of flood control projects such as mountain valley reservoirs, depression flood storage, and the Huaibei levee, last year's flood season was safely passed. Are all these not great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government? However, some right-wing elements insist that "achievements are not the main thing, you have made a mess of things." I cannot help but question the right-wing gentlemen again, many of you were high-ranking officials before liberation, but what have you done for the people? I lived in the old society for decades. To be honest, I have never heard of officials doing anything good for the people. However, in the short period since liberation, our country has achieved invaluable achievements on all fronts. Can any other party or any other government do this besides the Communist Party and the People's Government? Who is our savior? Who is our friend? Who is our enemy? The working class are most clear about this. Right-wing elements want to play tricks and carry out their ulterior motives. They cannot deceive the people. We will resolutely not allow it.

After the victory of our revolution, the country implemented the People's Congress system, continued to strengthen and expand the people's democratic united front. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives of various parties, groups, nationalities, and strata directly participated in the work of the state power. Weren't people like Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, and Luo Longji appointed as ministers of central state organs? However, although they became ministers, they did not diligently serve our working people. Instead, they tried every possible means to deprive our working people of the freedom and democracy they had gained, and even wanted to drag our working people back into the sea of ​​suffering of capitalist society. To be honest, your wishful thinking is doomed to fail. We do not want bourgeois democracy. We resolutely want socialist democracy. Only socialist democracy and freedom truly conform to the interests of our broad working people.

Finally, please allow me to state that I will definitely bring the spirit of this conference back and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite all employees without arrogance or impetuosity to do a good job in socialist construction; resolutely implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, combine immediate and long-term interests, and contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. We worker brothers must thoroughly smash the right-wing elements' rampant attacks with practical actions, and we will never stop until we win complete victory.

### 解放前和解放后真是天壤之别  郑久鸿说：谁是我们的救星，谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人，我们工人心中是最明白的。

    解放前和解放后真是天壤之别
    郑久鸿说：谁是我们的救星，谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人，我们工人心中是最明白的。
    我完全拥护周总理及中央各位首长的工作报告。
    我是从响洪甸水库的治淮工地上来参加这次大会的。在这次会议期间，我学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的文章以后，心中感到格外亮堂了，认识到要正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，而且不同性质的矛盾要采取不同的方法来处理。我认为毛主席所以在当前提出要正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，其目的是为了更好地团结全国六亿多人民朝着社会主义大道上前进，这是一看就明白的道理。可是，当我还未来北京以前，在响洪甸水库工地上就看到报纸上报道了章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、黄绍竑、龙云和谭惕吾等右派分子发表的诬蔑党、反对党、仇视社会主义制度，企图破坏党与人民群众之间的血肉联系等荒谬绝顶的言论，他们想借着帮助党整风和处理人民内部矛盾的机会，别有用心地向党和工人阶级进攻。这些使我感到极大的愤怒，我长久地按捺不住心中的怒火，我不得不来讲几句话了。
    我是一个老工人，今年已经五十八岁了。在解放以前的黑暗社会里，因为家里穷，从小就被父亲领到资本家的工厂里当学徒。为了糊碗饭吃，经常挨打受骂，还吃不饱穿不暖；后来出了师，当上正式工人了，每月工资只有三块钱。我们工人吃的仍是清水煮白菜，住的是只能弯着腰走进去的矮草房，穿的是东补西贴的破衣裳，过着牛马般的生活，还时时遭受失业的威胁。至于我们工人的政治地位当然更谈不上了。我记得解放前在上海做工，不要说想进大光明电影院看看电影，就是在那里站站也是不许可的。另外大家还记得吧，上海有个公园的门上还挂了牌子：“华人与狗不许入内”。那不仅是我们工人，就连中国人也被侮辱的。这一切的一切，不仅我们工人，我们爱国的成年人要记住，就是在幸福的社会主义环境下成长的下一代也要牢牢的记住它。
    解放后，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们工人才算彻底翻了身。不愁吃、不愁穿，住的是工人宿舍，还享受劳保福利。工人生病、养小孩都受到照顾。有的工人家庭人口太多的，还受到长期或短期的生活补助；工人再也不会受到失业的威胁，再也没有人骑在我们头上作威作福了。总之，一句话，共产党来了，好处是讲不完的。可是今天的右派分子却闭着眼睛说瞎话。硬说：“人民的生活没有提高，现在还不如解放前了”等等。我不禁要质问那些右派先生们，你们这样颠倒是非、黑白不分，除了说明你们是别有用心地煽动人民离开共产党而外，又能说明什么呢？
    解放八年来，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，我们国家在反对侵略战争和保卫世界和平的事业上；在消灭剥削和贫困、建设社会主义事业上；在文化教育事业；在交通运输事业；在土地改革、抗美援朝；三反、五反和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造及肃清反革命分子等等运动中，都获得了一系列的辉煌成就。这难道不是史无前例的伟大成绩吗？就以我个人亲身参加修建的佛子岭水库、梅山水库和响洪甸水库等伟大的水利工程来说，各位代表中可能也有不少人去参观过，它不仅在国内而且在国际上也是出名的。这些工程都经历了多次的大洪水的考验。就以去年汛期来说，淮北地区下了一千多公厘的雨，淮河发生了洪水。如以整个汛期的雨量来计算，与一九五四年差不多，由于山谷水库、洼地蓄洪及淮北大堤等一系列的防洪工程起了作用，所以去年就安全地度过了汛期。所有这些，难道不是在共产党和人民政府领导下所取得的伟大成绩吗？可是，一些右派分子却偏说：“成绩不是主要的，你们搞得一团糟。”我不禁又要质问右派的先生们，在你们当中就有不少的人在解放前当过大官的，可是你们给人民做了些什么呢？我在旧社会里过了几十年，说老实话，我从来就没有听说过当官的给人民办过什么好事。但是，在解放以后的短短时期内，我们的国家在各个战线上就取得了不可估价的成绩，这些除了共产党和人民政府能够这样做而外，其他的任何别的党派和任何别的政府能够做得出来吗？谁是我们的救星？谁是我们的朋友？谁是我们的敌人？我们工人的心中是最明白的，右派分子想玩花样，想施展他们不可告人的阴谋，那是骗不了人的，我们是坚决不允许的。
    我国革命胜利后，国家就实行了人民代表大会制度，继续加强与扩大了人民民主统一战线，在中国共产党的领导下，各党派、团体、民族及各阶层的代表人物，都直接参加国家的政权工作。像章伯钧、章乃器、罗隆基等人不都是当了中央国家机关的部长吗？可是，他们虽然当了部长，却没有勤勤恳恳地为我们劳动人民办事，他们却在千方百计地要剥夺我们劳动人民已获得自由和民主，还要把我们劳动人民拖回到资本主义社会的苦海中去。说句实在话，你们的如意算盘是注定打错了。我们不要资产阶级的民主，我们坚决要社会主义的民主，只有社会主义的民主和自由，才真正符合我们广大劳动人民的利益。
    最后，请允许我表明：我一定把这次大会的精神带回去，坚决在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，不骄不躁地团结全体职工，搞好社会主义建设事业；坚决贯彻勤俭建国的方针，把眼前的利益和长远的利益结合起来，为祖国的社会主义建设事业而贡献出一切力量。我们工人兄弟们一定要以实际行动来彻底粉碎右派分子的猖狂进攻，不获全胜，决不收兵。
