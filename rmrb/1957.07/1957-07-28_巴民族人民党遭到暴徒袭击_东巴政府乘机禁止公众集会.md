Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 27th: The newly formed National Awami Party of Pakistan was disrupted by thugs during a mass rally organized in Dhaka on July 26th. The East Pakistan government imposed Section 144 in Dhaka that evening, banning all public gatherings for two weeks.

Shortly after the start of the rally, a burst of firecrackers signaled the beginning of the disturbance. The crowd caught one of the people setting off the firecrackers. At the same time, more than twenty people wielding iron-clad cudgels suddenly rushed into the venue from the north. These people rushed towards the rostrum, began to destroy the loudspeakers, and attacked the audience. A conflict then ensued between these people and the audience. According to the Pakistan Press Association, a dozen or so people were injured during the conflict.

As previously reported, the day before this incident – July 25th – a group of "demonstrators" demonstrated in front of the conference hall of the democratic parties' representatives conference and tried to prevent the representatives from entering the venue.

According to local newspapers, about twelve political leaders and political workers, including National Party leader Mian Iftikharuddin, were beaten by supporters of the ruling Awami League when they went to attend the representatives conference on the 25th.

The headquarters of the National Awami Party, established by the democratic parties' representatives conference, will be located in Karachi, with a branch in Dhaka. The preamble to the draft party constitution states that the new party is formed by the merger of the democratic forces of East Pakistan, the Pakistan National Party of West Pakistan, the Democratic Party, and other political parties.

    巴民族人民党遭到暴徒袭击
    东巴政府乘机禁止公众集会
    据新华社卡拉奇27日电　巴基斯坦新成立的民族人民党7月26日在达卡组织的一次群众大会遭到了暴徒的捣乱。东巴基斯坦政府当天晚上在达卡实行了第一百四十四条法令，在两星期内禁止举行一切公众集会。
    在大会开始后不久，一阵爆竹声发出了骚动开始的信号。群众捉住了一个燃放爆竹的人。同时，二十多个手持包铁粗杖的人突然从北面冲进会场。这些人冲向主席台，开始捣毁扩音器，并且袭击听众。于是这些人和听众之间发生了冲突。据巴基斯坦报联社的消息，有十数人在发生这场冲突的时候受了伤。
    前已报道，在这次事件的前一天——7月25日，曾有一群“示威者”在民主党派代表会议会议厅前示威，并且设法阻止代表们进入会场。
    据这里的报纸报道，约有十二位政治领袖和政治工作者，包括民族党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁在内，在25日去参加代表会议的时候被支持执政党人民联盟的人打伤。
    民主党派代表会议成立的民族人民党总部将设在卡拉奇，另在达卡设支部。这个党的党章草案的前言说，新政党是由东巴基斯坦的民主力量、西巴基斯坦的巴基斯坦民族党、民主党以及其他政党合并组成的。
