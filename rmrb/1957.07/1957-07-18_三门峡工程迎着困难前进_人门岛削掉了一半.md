    The Sanmenxia Project Advances in the Face of Difficulties
    Renmen Island Cut in Half

    (Report from Henan Daily) Since the commencement of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, the workers have been overcoming difficulties and striding forward.

    Currently, the excavation of the foundation rock for the main project on the left bank has been completed for over 70,000 cubic meters, and the hard Renmen Island has been cut in half. With the 2,500 kW train power station transmitting electricity to Sanmenxia via an eight-kilometer high-voltage power line, a powerful power system has been established. After the "Ural Giant"—a three-cubic-meter electric shovel that loads a truckload of stone in one minute—was put into operation, the phenomenon of muck removal lagging behind blasting progress has been fundamentally reversed.

    On the afternoon of July 5th, the workers used a new blasting method to set off the first major blast, causing 2,500 cubic meters of rock to collapse on Renmen Island, turning it into gravel. The successful trial of the new blasting method laid the foundation for completing the dam rock excavation project in July.

    Auxiliary projects have also made progress. The automobile base on the loess terrace on the right bank was completed ahead of schedule, and bulldozer groups are leveling the ground for the concrete mixing plant and the right bank section system halfway up the mountain next to the砥柱石. The steel bridge across the Yellow River downstream of Sanmenxia is a vital passage for construction next year. Workers from the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge construction site overcame various difficulties, and after erecting a steel sheet pile cofferdam in the rapid current, they are using the caisson foundation method of the Yangtze River Bridge to pour the foundations of Piers No. 3 and No. 4. They are striving to pour the foundations of these two piers out of the water before the major flood season. At the Shijiatan ferry upstream of Sanmenxia, boatmen are hurriedly transporting machinery, equipment, and supplies to the left bank to ensure that construction is not delayed by the arrival of the major flood. The Hui-San permanent highway, connecting to the Longhai Railway, has been completed except for a small section at the dam head, and has been paved with asphalt. 13.7 kilometers of the Hui-San Railway has been opened to traffic.

### 三门峡工程迎着困难前进  人门岛削掉了一半

    三门峡工程迎着困难前进
    人门岛削掉了一半
    本报讯  河南日报消息：三门峡水利枢纽工程开工以后，职工们不断克服困难大踏步前进。
    现在，左岸主体工程基础岩石开挖已完成七万余方，坚硬的人门岛被削去一半。由于两千五百瓩的列车发电站通过八公里的高压输电线把电流送到了三门峡，强大的动力系统建立起来了。一分钟装一卡车石碴的“乌拉尔巨人”——三立方电铲投入运转以后，出碴赶不上爆破进度的现象根本扭转。
    7月5日下午，职工们用新的爆破方法放响了第一个大炮，人门岛上有二千五百方石头倒塌下来，变成了碎石。新爆破法的试验成功，为完成7月份大坝岩石开挖工程奠定了基础。
    辅助工程也有了进展。右岸黄土台地上的汽车基地提前平整完毕，推土机群正在砥柱石右边的半山腰中给混凝土拌和楼和右岸工段系统平整场地。三门峡下游横跨黄河的钢桥，是供明年施工的要道。来自兰州黄河铁桥工地上的职工克服了种种困难，在激流中矗立起钢板桩围埝以后，正采用长江大桥管柱支承桥墩的方法来浇注三号和四号桥墩的基础。他们争取在大汛前把这两个桥墩的基础浇出水面。在三门峡上游的史家滩渡口，船工们正匆忙的向左岸抢运机械、器材和生活用品，以便保证大汛到来不误施工。连接陇海路的会三永久公路，除坝头一小段外，全线完成，并铺好了柏油路面。会三铁路有十三点七公里已经通车。
