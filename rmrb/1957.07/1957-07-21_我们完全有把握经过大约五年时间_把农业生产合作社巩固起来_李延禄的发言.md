We are Fully Confident that Agricultural Production Cooperatives Can Be Consolidated in About Five Years
Li Yanlu's Speech

I fully agree with the government work report made by Premier Zhou and the various reports of other responsible comrades. Now I would like to express some opinions on the situation and problems of agricultural advanced cooperativization in Heilongjiang Province.

Advanced Cooperativization Greatly Increased Productivity

It has been more than a year since our province realized advanced agricultural cooperativization. Judging from this period of production practice, it shows the superiority of the new economic system. I believe that the first is a great increase in productivity. According to a typical survey of nineteen agricultural cooperatives, agricultural cooperativization has indeed freed itself from the shackles of the small-scale peasant economy, and the enthusiasm of farmers for labor has been improved. The labor force participating in production increased by 10% for men and 30% to 50% for women compared with the past. The average working day for male labor increased by 20% to 30% compared with the past, and the average working day for female labor increased by 60% compared with the past. The utilization rate of draught animals and large farm tools has also increased by 20% to 30%, and the investment capacity for expanded reproduction has generally increased by about 20% compared with the past. This new and significant change is the basis for the greater and faster development of production in advanced cooperatives than in elementary cooperatives.

After agricultural cooperativization, the province reclaimed 760,000 hectares of wasteland last year, equivalent to 60% of the total area reclaimed since the land reform. This also proves that advanced agricultural cooperativization has created conditions for expanding the cultivated land area.

In the past year, advanced cooperatives have carried out farmland water conservancy construction on a scale that the small-scale peasant economy could not achieve. More than 3,000 large and small water conservancy projects have been built, and 120,000 hectares of paddy fields have been developed, which is equivalent to the total number of paddy fields developed in the forty years before liberation. The area of fertilizer application has been expanded by 800,000 hectares, an increase of more than 10% compared with the past. The sowing area of ​​animal-drawn farm tools has been expanded by 1 million hectares, more than double the previous amount. The area for the promotion of improved varieties has been expanded by 400,000 hectares, an increase of 30% compared with the past. The intercropping area has been expanded to 1.13 million hectares, about double the previous amount. The scale and speed of water conservancy construction and technological transformation are also unimaginable for the small-scale peasant economy.

Last year, Heilongjiang Province suffered the largest flood disaster and severe waterlogging disaster in the hydrological records in history. The highest water level of the Songhua River was 72 centimeters higher than 119.72 meters in 1932, but the area devastated by floods was more than three times less than the 760,000 hectares in 1932. In the past, if such a major flood occurred, 2 million farmers in the province would be ruined and displaced. However, today there are disaster-stricken cooperatives but no disaster-stricken people. According to farmers, "If it weren't for cooperativization, I don't know how many households would have nothing to eat last year, and rich peasants would have flourished again." They realized from the vivid fact of "disaster-stricken cooperatives, no disaster-stricken people" that cooperativization is indeed good, and the root of poverty has been eradicated for future generations.

Precisely because the cooperatives have adopted a series of technical production increase measures and overcome the unprecedented flood, the agricultural production of our province in 1956 did not cause a major reduction in production. The grain output also reached 7.9 million tons, only 300,000 tons less than the bumper harvest in 1955. If it weren't for the power of cooperativization, the amount of production reduction last year would undoubtedly have been much larger.

Pulling Out the Roots of Poverty for Future Generations

After advanced agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production has increased, and the income of cooperative members has also increased. Despite the severe flood situation last year, most of the cooperatives in our province still achieved increased production and increased income. According to the statistics of actual distribution results: among the 8,835 cooperatives in the province, 58.2% increased production, 11.09% remained unchanged, and 30.71% reduced production. 66.28% of cooperative members increased their income, 5.43% remained unchanged, and 28.29% reduced their income. The vast majority of cooperatives with reduced production were due to disasters, and a small part was due to poor work. In addition to most of the members of disaster-stricken cooperatives, the members of the general cooperatives with reduced income were mainly upper-middle peasants who had slightly exploited in the past and farmers with weaker labor forces. This figure shows that our cooperatives are basically successful, and the superiority of the cooperatives cannot be denied by anyone. Not only do the members of the cooperatives that increased production and income reflect the superiority of the cooperatives, but also the members of the disaster-stricken cooperatives that reduced their income also acknowledge the superiority of the cooperatives. They said: "If it weren't for cooperativization, I don't know how many households would have nothing to eat last year, and rich peasants would have flourished again." They realized from the vivid fact of "disaster-stricken cooperatives, no disaster-stricken people" that cooperativization is indeed good, and the root of poverty has been eradicated for future generations.

From the perspective of general areas that have not suffered from floods, the soil quality of Zhaozhou County is not considered good in our province, but last year it achieved a county-wide bumper harvest. Among the 186 cooperatives in the county, 173 cooperatives increased production, accounting for 93% of the total number of cooperatives. Among them, 80 cooperatives increased production by 0.5% to 10%, 48 cooperatives increased production by 10% to 20%, 20 cooperatives increased production by 20% to 30%, and 25 cooperatives increased production by more than 30%, ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members increased their income. Last year, 82 agricultural cooperatives and 8 townships in the province had an average yield of more than 4,000 catties per hectare. In 1955, although it was a bumper harvest year, there was only one such elementary cooperative in the province.

Of course, this does not mean that all cooperatives have been run very well, and the quality of cooperative management is still uneven. However, it should be seen that the current trend of cooperatives is: the number of cooperatives with increased production and income is gradually increasing, and the number of cooperatives with reduced production and income is gradually decreasing.

Due to the superiority of cooperativization and the measures taken by the state, the lives of farmers have also been greatly improved. Taking Shuangcheng County as an example, before liberation, 8% of the county's population lived the life of landlords and rich peasants, 9% lived the life of upper-middle peasants, 12% lived the life of lower-middle peasants, and 71% of the majority lived the life of poor and hired peasants. But now it has been reversed. 36% of the county's population are living a life with savings, 49% are living a life with enough to eat and wear, and 15% have a poorer life with less to eat or wear, but these people are also better off than the poor peasants in the past. Only those who stand on the position of the exploiting class and have ulterior motives will say that the lives of farmers are not as good as before liberation.

Farmers' Lives are Improving Not Too Slowly

Is the improvement of farmers' lives too slow? From the perspective of Heilongjiang Province, the average net income per farmer household in 1950 was 458 yuan, which increased to 479 yuan in 1953, 504 yuan in 1954, 568 yuan in 1955, and 550 yuan in 1956, although the province added 200,000 migrant households and 800,000 hectares of land suffered severe natural disasters. Among them, 66.28% of cooperative members increased their income, which proves that the living standards of farmers have significantly increased after advanced cooperativization. Even if a small number of households reduced their income, their living standards have not declined. The rightists just don't see the dominant aspect of things. They confuse black and white, reverse right and wrong, and say that "the living standards of farmers have declined after advanced cooperativization." This is a malicious attack on the real life of our people and is essentially a conspiracy to provoke farmers' dissatisfaction with the government. The eyes of the farmers are discerning. The nonsense of the rightists has aroused great indignation among the farmers.

The income of farmers is indeed less than that of workers, but the actual living standards are not as disparate as some rightists with ulterior motives say, and the gap in between is getting smaller and smaller. Before liberation, the average annual income per worker household in our province was 450 yuan, and the average annual income per farmer household was 320 yuan. Now the average annual income per worker household is 762 yuan, and the average annual income per farmer household is 550 yuan. With the increase in income for both workers and farmers after liberation, the speed of increase for farmers is relatively fast. If we compare the actual expenditures of workers and farmers, workers live in urban environments, and they need to rent and buy for living expenses, so workers spend more than farmers. At the same time, because workers create more production value for society than farmers, it is reasonable for workers to earn more than farmers. Of course, the current living standards of farmers are not ideal. They will gradually improve with the gradual consolidation and improvement of cooperatives and the continued development of agricultural production, which is certain. As for the farmers with less income and more difficult lives, the main reasons are: large population and small labor force; the main labor force in the family is sick, works fewer workdays or cannot engage in heavy physical labor; some families only have auxiliary labor force and have lost their ability to work due to old age and illness; some have the ability to work, but they cause some difficulties in family life because they do not like labor. We are actively developing production for different situations, organizing mass production self-rescue in disaster areas, strengthening the leadership in weak areas; for those poor cooperative members, we actively organize them to develop family production by participating in various labor of the cooperative according to their strengths and abilities, plus the appropriate economic care from the cooperative, these problems can be gradually resolved.

The masses raise opinions to improve work

It should be affirmed that the achievements of advanced cooperativization last year are the main ones, and the vast majority of cooperative members are satisfied with the cooperatives. In particular, emphasizing democratic management of the cooperatives and humbly listening to the opinions of the cooperative members have continuously improved the work of the cooperatives. During the consolidation of the cooperatives this spring, the opinions raised by the masses were very sharp, but the vast majority of cooperative members raised opinions to improve the work of the cooperatives, and they were all accepted by the cooperative cadres. The masses said: "It would be good to do this way." Some masses changed from complaining about the cadres to caring for the cadres. They said: "The cadres have good intentions. They all want to run the cooperatives well and let everyone live a good life. The only difference is that they didn't have experience in the first year. You see, it's starting to get better this year." However, some of the opinions from the well-off middle peasants have positive significance for improving the work of the cooperatives, but some people have a kind of dissatisfaction with the cooperatives due to reduced income and other reasons. They often do not start from a positive point of view to improve the work of the cooperatives, but adopt a cold and sarcastic attitude to treat the shortcomings of the cooperatives. Even individual bad elements use certain shortcomings of the cooperatives, exaggerate the shortcomings, create rumors, and provoke the relationship between the cooperative members and the cooperative cadres. This is an attempt to sabotage and disintegrate the cooperatives, which should be vigilant. Therefore, the opinions of those farmers on the cooperatives should be specifically analyzed. At present, the rightists believe that cooperativization is "very bad" and doubt the superiority of cooperativization, which is very wrong.

We emphasize the superiority of cooperativization, but it does not mean that there are no shortcomings and errors. The main shortcomings and errors in the work of the cooperatives last year were: planned targets were too high, basic construction was too large, technological transformation lacked adaptation to local conditions, sideline production was neglected, management was poor, and waste of labor and materials was serious. There have been great improvements this year. At present, some problems still exist in the cooperatives, such as: the quality of some field operations is not high, some draught animals are thin and weak, and some local specialties have decreased. In short, each cooperative can find some problems and shortcomings, which are produced in the progress of cooperativization. These shortcomings are still secondary and partial compared with the great achievements made after advanced cooperativization, and the vast number of cadres and the masses have not been frightened by these problems and difficulties. On the contrary, after the problems are clarified, they are moving forward with full confidence.

After specific investigation, the main reason for the existence of problems is that the cooperative has just been established, the management system is not sound, and the management power is somewhat too centralized. The unified management and hierarchical management system that has been widely promoted in the cooperatives this year, that is, under the unified leadership of the cooperative, the scope of responsibilities and rights between the interests of the cooperative, team, group, and individual cooperative members has been clarified, which effectively solves this problem. Mishan County only stipulated that after completing the production plan of the cooperative, the land opened up will be distributed by the production team, and the county opened up 2,000 hectares of land. After clarifying the scope of sideline businesses operated by the cooperative, team, group, and individual cooperative members, the sporadic sideline businesses that no one had been operating last year have now been restored, and the number has increased significantly. This year, the fixed quota piecework payment system and the four-contract excess reward system have been widely promoted in the cooperatives, which has solved the problem of neglecting labor quality caused by egalitarianism in labor calculation and some unreasonable aspects in the distribution system. For example, after Wangkui County's Zheng Bai Er Society implemented the four-contract system, during spring plowing and production, the labor attendance rate of the eight production teams was often above 85%, the cultivation quality was better than any year, the expenditure was 57% lower than the same period last year, and the farming horses not only did not lose weight during the busy sowing period, but also gained weight. Similar examples can be found in every township. These facts fully demonstrate that the above-mentioned problems are not the products of the cooperative system itself, but the result of some links in the cooperative management system and distribution system that are not sound enough. The timely solution of these problems will further enhance the wisdom and enthusiasm of farmers and fully utilize all economic potentials in rural areas to develop agricultural production and open up broad prospects.

Correctly Handle Contradictions Among the People, Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Farmers

At present, the various problems exposed by the cooperatives are all contradictions among the people. The fundamental way to solve these problems is to correctly handle contradictions among the people, mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers, comprehensively develop rural production, and further consolidate and improve the new socialist agricultural economic system. However, this task is very arduous, not smooth sailing, and requires a considerable period of tortuous struggle to finally consolidate. We are fully confident that it will take about five years to do the work that needs to be done and consolidate the cooperative system of agriculture.

At present, there are still bureaucracy and subjectivism in our rural leadership. For example, in the issue of well-digging in our province, regardless of regional conditions, cooperatives are generally called upon to dig wells, and well-digging tasks are assigned to cooperatives. As a result, some wells are dug that are not needed, and some abandoned wells are dug that cannot be used, causing a huge waste of human and material resources. For example, in recent years, the purchase price of live cattle has been too low, and live cattle are not as valuable as dead cattle. A cowhide can only be exchanged for a pair of Wula boots. This problem has not been resolved until now, which seriously affects the enthusiasm of the masses for raising cattle. This situation not only weakens the livestock power needed for agricultural production, but also directly affects the meat supply in cities. Therefore, we believe that the Party Central Committee's instruction to launch a rectification movement throughout the Party is very timely and necessary. At present, the rightists are using the Party's rectification to launch vicious and rampant attacks on the Party's leadership and the socialist road, which is not allowed by the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that through the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, the Party's rectification movement will be successfully launched, and rectification will greatly overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, thereby helping to promote the resolution of contradictions among the rural people and greatly improve the country's socialist construction.

    我们完全有把握经过大约五年时间  把农业生产合作社巩固起来
    李延禄的发言
    我完全同意周总理所作的政府工作报告和其他负责同志的各项报告，现在我就黑龙江省的农业高级合作化的情况和问题发表一点意见。
    高级合作化大大提高了生产力
    我省实现农业高级合作化，到现在已经过一年多了，从这段生产实践过程中看，它显示了新经济制度的优越性，我认为首先是大大提高了生产力。根据十九个农业社的典型调查，农业合作化确实解脱了小农经济的束缚，农民的劳动积极性提高了。参加生产的劳动力，男的比以前增百分之十，女的比以前增加了百分之三十至五十，男劳动力平均工作日比以前提高了百分之二十至三十，女劳动力平均工作日比以前提高了百分之六十，耕畜和大型农具的运用率也提高了百分之二十至三十，扩大再生产的投资能力一般的比以前提高百分之二十左右。这个新的重大变化，就是高级社比初级社较多较快的发展生产的基础。
    农业合作化后，去年一年全省就开垦了七十六万公顷荒地，相等于土改以后全部开荒面积总和的百分之六十，这也证明农业高级合作化为扩大耕地面积创造了条件。
    去年一年来，高级社以小农经济不能达到的规模进行了农田水利的建设。兴修大小水利工程三千余处，开发水田十二万公顷，等于解放前四十年发展水田的总数。扩大施肥面积八十万公顷，较以前增加百分之十强。马拉农具播种面积扩大一百万公顷，较以前增加二倍以上。推广优良品种的面积扩大了四十万公顷。较以前增加百分之三十。混种面积扩大到一百一十三万公顷，较以前增加一倍左右。这种兴修水利与改革技术的规模和速度，也是小农经济不可想像的。
    去年黑龙江省遭受了历史上有水文记载以来的最大的洪水灾害和严重的内涝灾害。松花江的最高水位比一九三二年一百一十九点七二公尺，还多出了七十二公分，但是受洪水灾害绝产的面积却比一九三二年的七十六万公顷减少了三倍还多。过去遭受这样大的水灾，全省要有二百万农民倾家荡产、流离失所。但是，今天却是有灾社无灾民。据农民讲：过去谁家要是遭了这样水灾，至少要三年才能恢复起来。但是今年农业合作社并没有因此而缩小生产，他们不但胜利的完成了春耕播种任务，而且还挖了三百多万公方土的排水壕，使十六万公顷涝洼地免受了内涝灾害的威胁。仅就治理松花江的水利工程来说，去年和今春就完成了一千三百万公方的土方工程。可见高级农业合作化在抗御自然灾害方面的作用是很大的。
    正由于合作社采取了一系列技术增产措施和战胜了空前的水灾，因此才使一九五六年我省的农业生产没有造成大的减产，粮食产量还达到了七百九十万吨，比丰收的一九五五年只减产了三十万吨粮食。如果不是合作化力量，去年减产的数量，无疑的要比这大得多。
    为子孙万代拔掉了穷根
    高级农业合作化后，农业生产提高了，社员的收入也增加了。尽管在去年那样严重的水灾情况下，我省多半数合作社还是达到了增加生产增加收入。根据分配实际结果的统计是：全省八千八百三十五个合作社，增产社占百分之五十八点二，不增不减的社占百分之十一点零九，减产社占百分之三十点七一。增加收入的社员占百分之六十六点二八，不增不减的社员占百分之五点四三，减少收入的社员占百分之二十八点二九。其中减产的社绝大多数是因为受灾，也有一少部分是因为工作不好而造成减产的。减少收入的农民除了多数是受灾社的社员以外，一般社减少收入的社员主要是过去有轻微剥削的上中农和劳动力较弱的农民。这个数字说明了我们办合作社基本上是成功的，合作社的优越性是任何人抹煞不了的，不但增产增收的合作社社员反映合作社优越，就是那些受灾减少收入的合作社社员也承认合作社优越，他们说：“要不叫合作化，去年说不定有多少户吃不上，富农又该兴洋了”，他们从“有灾社，无灾民”的鲜明事实中体会到，合作化确实好，子孙万代拔掉了穷根。
    从没有遭受水灾的一般地区来看，像肇州县的土质在我们省并不算好，但是去年就获得了全县范围的丰收。全县一百八十六个合作社，有一百七十三个合作社增了产，占总社数百分之九十三，其中增产百分之零点五至十的有八十个社，增产百分之十至二十的有四十八个社，增产百分之二十至三十的有二十个社，增产百分之三十以上的有二十五个社，保证了百分之九十以上社员增加收入。去年全省已经有八十二个农业社和八个乡平均每公顷产量达到四千斤以上。而一九五五年虽然是丰收年，这样的初级社全省只有一个。
    当然，这并不是说所有的合作社都已经办得很好了，现在合作社办得好坏还是不平衡的。但是应当看到，目前合作社的趋势是：增产增收的社是在逐渐增加，减产减收的社在逐渐减少。
    由于合作化的优越性以及国家采取若干措施，农民生活也大大改善了，就以双城县为例，解放前全县有百分之八的人过着地主、富农的生活，百分之九的人过着上中农的生活，百分之十二的人过着下中农的生活，而百分之七十一的多数人却过着贫雇农的生活。可是现在颠倒过来了，全县已有百分之三十六的人过着有积余的生活，百分之四十九的人过着够吃够穿的生活，而生活较差少吃或少穿的占百分之十五，但这些人也比过去的贫农的生活提高了。只有那种站在剥削阶级立场和别有用心的人，才会说农民生活不如解放以前。
    农民生活提高得不算太慢
    农民生活是不是提高太慢了呢？以黑龙江省的情况看，一九五○年平均每户农民纯收入四百五十八元，一九五三年增加到四百七十九元，一九五四年增加到五百零四元，一九五五年增加到五百六十八元，一九五六年虽然因为全省增加了二十万户移民和八十万垧地遭受严重的自然灾害，但是平均每户纯收入还达到五百五十元，其中有百分之六十六点二八的社员增加了收入，这就证明，高级合作化以后农民生活水平显著的上升了，即使有一少部分减少收入户，生活水平也不是下降了。右派分子就是不看事情的主导方面，他们混淆黑白，颠倒是非，说什么“高级合作化以后农民生活水平下降了”的谰调，这是对我们人民现实生活的恶毒攻击，实质是挑拨农民对政府不满的阴谋。农民的眼睛是雪亮的。右派分子的胡言乱语，已引起农民的绝大愤慨。
    农民的收入固属比工人收入少一些，可是实际生活水平相差得决不像某些别有用心的右派分子所说的那样悬殊，而且中间差额越来越小了。解放前，我省工人平均每年每户收入四百五十元，农民每户每年平均收入三百二十元，现在工人平均每户每年收入七百六十二元，农民每户每年平均收入五百五十元，在解放后工人和农民收入都有增加的情况下，农民增加的速度是比较快的。如果从工人和农民实际支出情况来比较，由于工人居住的是城市环境，在生活用费上，都需要租赁和购买，因此工人支出比农民较多。同时由于工人比农民所给社会创造的生产价值较大，即使工人较农民收入多些，也是合乎情理的。当然，农民的现实生活水平，并不是理想的水平，它将随着合作社的逐步巩固和健全，随着农业生产的继续发展，会逐步提高，这是可以肯定的。至于收入较少生活较困难的农民，其原因主要是：人口多、劳动力少；家中主要劳动力多病，少作了劳动日或是不能从事繁重的体力劳动；有的家中仅有辅助劳动力也因为老弱生病失去了劳动能力；有的虽有劳动能力，由于不爱好劳动而造成家庭生活的一些困难。我们正针对不同情况积极发展生产，在灾区组织群众性的生产自救，加强薄弱地区的领导；对那些贫困的社员，按其所长和所能参加合作社的各种劳动，积极组织他们发展家庭生产，加上合作社适当的经济照顾，这些问题是可以逐步解决的。群众提意见是为了改进工作
    应当肯定，去年高级合作化成绩是主要的，广大社员对合作社是满意的。特别是强调民主办社，虚心听取社员的意见，就不断的改进了合作社的工作。今春整社当中，群众提意见是很尖锐的，但是广大社员提意见是为了改进合作社的工作，而且都为社干部所接受，群众说：“这样做就好了”，有些群众由埋怨干部转到了体贴干部，他们说：“干部的心都是好心，都是为了把社办好，让大家过好日子，就差头一年没有经验，你们看，今年不就开始变好了。”但是来自富裕中农中间意见有些是改进合作社的工作有积极意义，可是也有些人由于收入减少和其他种种原因，对合作社有一种不满情绪，他们往往不是从积极出发来改进社的工作，而是采取冷讥热讽的态度，来对待合作社的缺点。甚至也有个别坏分子利用合作社某些缺点，夸大缺点，造谣生事，挑拨社员与社干部之间的关系，这是属于破坏和瓦解合作社的一种企图，是应当警惕的。因此，应当具体分析那些农民对合作社那些意见。目前右派分子认为合作化“糟得很”，怀疑合作化的优越性，这是非常错误的。
    我们强调合作化优越性，绝不是说就没有缺点和错误。去年在合作社的工作中的缺点和错误主要是：计划指标偏高，基本建设过大，技术改革缺乏因地制宜，忽视副业生产，管理不善，窝工浪费现象严重等等，今年已经有了很大的改进。目前合作社也还存在着一些问题，如：有的田间作业质量不高，有的耕畜瘦弱，有的土特产品品种减少等。总之，每个合作社都可以找出一些问题和缺点，这些问题是合作化前进中产生的。这些缺点比起高级合作化后所取得的巨大成绩来说还是次要的、局部的，而且广大干部和群众并没有被这些问题和困难所吓倒，相反的，在问题弄清后，正满怀信心地前进。
    经过具体考察，存在问题的主要原因是由于合作社初建，管理体制不健全，管理权力有些过于集中。今年普遍在合作社中推广的统一经营分级管理制度，即在合作社统一领导下，社、队、组和社员个人利益之间划清了责任和权利范围，就有效地解决了这个问题。密山县仅规定一项在完成合作社生产计划以后，多开的荒由生产队自行分配，全县就多开了两千公顷土地。在把社、队、组和社员个人经营的副业范围划清以后，去年已经没人经营的零星副业现在又都恢复起来，而且数量有了显著增加，今年在合作社中普遍推行了定额计件付酬制和四包超额奖励制，就解决了因劳动计算平均主义和分配制度中某些不够合理而引起忽视劳动质量的问题。例如望奎县正白二社实行四包以后，在春耕生产中，八个生产队劳动出勤率经常在百分之八十五以上，耕作质量比任何一年都好，开支比去年同时期节省百分之五十七，耕马在繁忙的播种期间，不但没有掉膘，反而增了膘。类似这样的例子，每个乡都可以找到。这些事实充分说明了上述存在问题并不是合作社制度本身的产物，而是合作社管理制度和分配制度某些环节尚不够健全的结果，这些问题的及时解决，它会更加高度地发挥农民的智慧和积极性，充分利用农村一切经济潜力，为发展农业生产，开辟广阔的前途。
    正确处理人民内部矛盾，调动农民的积极性
    目前合作社暴露出来的种种问题，都是人民内部的矛盾。解决这些问题的根本途径就是要正确的处理人民内部矛盾，调动农民的积极性，全面发展农村生产，进一步巩固和健全新的社会主义农业经济制度。但是，这个任务是十分艰巨的，不是一帆风顺的，是需要经过一个相当时期的曲折斗争，才能最终巩固下来。我们完全有把握，大约经过五年时间，把需要作的工作做好，使农业合作社的制度巩固起来。
    目前我们在农村领导方面还存在着官僚主义、主观主义。例如我们省在打井问题上不分地区情况，普遍号召合作社打井，向合作社分派打井任务，结果有些井打了并不需要，也打了一些废井不能利用，造成人力和物力的巨大浪费。再如几年来，活牛收购价格偏低，活牛不如死牛值钱，一张牛皮仅换一双靰鞡，这个问题一直拖到现在还没有解决，严重影响了群众养牛的积极性。这种情况，不仅减弱了农业生产所需要的畜力，而且直接影响城市的肉食供应。因此，我们认为党中央指示在全党范围内展开整风运动，这是非常适时和必要的。目前右派分子利用党的整风来对党的领导和走社会主义道路进行恶毒的猖狂的攻击，这是全国人民所不能允许的，现在全国人民正在开展反右派的斗争。我们坚信，经过反右派斗争的胜利，党的整风运动一定会顺利开展起来，搞好整风，一定会大大克服官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，从而有利于推动农村人民内部矛盾的解决，使国家的社会主义建设事业大大提高一步。
