    Our conference is being held on the eve of the successful completion of our country's first Five-Year Plan; our conference is also being held amidst the fierce struggle of the people of our country to counterattack the Rightists. Before the meeting, Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was officially published. This is our guiding light, illuminating the path forward for the people of the whole country; it is also a demon-revealing mirror, exposing all monsters and freaks in their true forms. This is a powerful ideological and political weapon, and we must study it, study it again, and study it yet again, drawing infinite strength from it to mercilessly defeat the Rightists' rampant attacks and achieve victory in the socialist cause.
    Since the opening of the conference, I have also heard Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and other work reports, and I fully agree with and support these reports. Premier Zhou's highly persuasive report, based on the principles put forward by Chairman Mao and using irrefutable iron facts, affirmed the glorious achievements of our country's five major movements, three major transformations, and socialist construction, analyzed the difficulties and shortcomings in our path forward, and sternly criticized the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists who oppose the Party and oppose socialism. This is conducive to the unity of the people of the whole country on a new basis and strengthens the forces of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    The bourgeois Rightists, enjoying the fruits of the labor of workers and peasants, staged a reactionary chorus.
    After our country's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory, the Chinese Communist Party, in order to further lead the people of the whole country to successfully build a socialist society and make our country even more beautiful and magnificent; in order to give full play to the superiority of the socialist system and enable our people to gradually improve their material and cultural living standards with the growth of production, but this great and arduous work is inseparable from our active and creative labor; therefore, the Party timely put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," requiring the unity of all forces that can be united and the mobilization of all positive factors that can be mobilized to strive together for socialist construction. In order to implement this policy, the Party, on the basis of already prepared conditions, first proposed Party rectification and called on all non-Party人士 to actively help the Party carry out rectification, to eliminate certain bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian tendencies existing in the Party members, so as to make the Party organization more pure and the Party's leadership stronger; at the same time, it also required that in the process of this rectification, the broad masses should be educated, tempered, and cultivated in the storms of struggle, and their revolutionary consciousness and combat capability should be improved. This fully embodies that the Chinese Communist Party is a party that proceeds from the interests of the people in everything, is the most determined and unremittingly promotes the progress of social history, and is a great, glorious, and correct party. Such a rectification movement is unprecedented and impossible for any political party in history. However, the bourgeois Rightists, living under the socialist system and enjoying the fruits of the labor created by the workers and peasants, actually staged a reactionary chorus in the process of this rectification movement. This is a serious class struggle in the current political and ideological field, and it is a dangerous attempt to restore the capitalist system in our country. But their estimation is completely wrong! Their class limitations make them "blinded by greed," unable to see that after nearly forty years of arduous struggle, the Party has been tempered into a politically mature and unbreakable party; unable to see that the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and people of all ethnic groups throughout the country have been closely united around the Communist Party, protecting the Party that leads them forward and creates happiness for them as if they were protecting their own eyes. Therefore, they do not understand that no matter how clever their methods of frantically attacking socialism are, no matter how tightly they are concealed, they cannot cover up the eyes of the awakened Chinese people, nor can they intimidate the fighting will of the Chinese people who have stood up.
    The inside story of the Rightists' conspiracy is constantly being exposed
    The nationwide anti-Rightist struggle is being carried out in a grand manner, with upright banners, and with great vigor. Within a month, it has blown away the dark clouds and poisonous fog released by the Rightists, making the political atmosphere of the whole country refreshed, and the broad masses truly feel that the red sun is shining and the spring breeze is warming. The Rightists have truly become "rats crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat them," and the inside story of their conspiracy is constantly being exposed. People have seen the ability of the Rightists, especially those leading figures and core members, to stir up trouble and set fires everywhere. They colluded from within and without, creating storms in all directions; they妄想 to compete for control of the country, seize power, and their wolfish ambitions were extremely sinister. This is because the Rightists we are facing are not simple and ordinary Rightists, but organized Rightists who have united. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are their "three armed forces commanders". Their political foundation is the democratic parties such as the Democratic League, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and their social foundation is the bourgeois elements who have lost their means of production, former military and political personnel, and bourgeois intellectuals who have not yet been transformed, including some students and young people who lack experience in class struggle. On such a basis, the Rightist group has established a nationwide system of conspiratorial activities, preparing forces and waiting for opportunities to launch.
    The Rightists are not only organized and planned, but also have a comprehensive program. Opposing the leadership of the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing the people's democratic dictatorship are their general principles; under the general principles, there are also specific and practical programs in politics, economy, law, culture, military affairs, diplomacy, ethnicity, and other aspects.
    The program needs a theoretical basis, and Zhang Naiqi is their greatest theorist. They said that Marx and Lenin had never seen atoms, so Marxism-Leninism is outdated. They said that capitalism has political democracy, socialism will lead to bureaucratism, there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements, the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature, and fixed interest is not exploitation, etc. All of these "theories" are the basis for opposing socialism and opening the way for capitalism.
    The Rightists' attack on the basic system of the country is meeting with a wall of iron
    "The fundamental problem of the revolution is the problem of political power," and both the enemy and we understand this truth. Therefore, the Rightists first attacked the basic system of our country, with the greatest and ultimate goal of seizing the leadership of the working class and establishing a bourgeois dictatorship.
    The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance and the democratic centralism of state organs are the basic system of our country. However, the Rightists specifically attacked this basic system. The Rightists, headed by the Zhang-Luo alliance, wanted to replace the leadership of the Communist Party with the leadership of the bourgeoisie and replace democratic centralism with "absolute democracy." Therefore, they said that the proletarian dictatorship is the ultimate source of the three evils, and put forward absurd propositions such as "political design institute," "party world," "alternating rule," "should not set up a separate party system outside the government," and "please the Communist Party step down." They attempted to undermine the worker-peasant alliance and deliberately exaggerated the contradictions between the peasants and the government. They thought that besides respectfully inviting the bourgeoisie to power and bestowing yellow robes on Zhang, Luo, Zhang, etc., what other methods could there be!
    However, the people will not agree. For decades, how many revolutionary martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves; today, the revolutionary fruits of the hard work of the working people of the whole country cannot be easily given away. Whoever dares to try lightly will surely be battered and bloodied in front of the people's wall of iron.
    Using facts seen in inspections to refute the Rightists' slander against the people's congress system
    Last year and this year, I have twice inspected the work of the People's Congress in the Northwest and Southwest regions. Here, I would like to use some facts I have personally seen and heard to refute the Rightists' various slanders against the People's Congress system.
    They said: "Capitalism has political democracy," implying that socialism has no political democracy. Our view is just the opposite. Taking elections as an example, the bourgeoisie's elections are all bought with money, and their purpose is to compete for power and profit. Since they are spending money to run for election, they will inevitably try every means to earn more money back after being elected. Their behavior is fundamentally contrary to the interests of the people. Their "democracy" can only be a false pretense of elections to engage in the wrongdoing of dividing spoils, buying people, and colluding with each other.
    Our socialist democracy is true democracy. In my inspections in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, I saw that the political enthusiasm of the people participating in the elections was unprecedentedly high, and the voting rate reached more than 94 percent. Much higher than in 1953. I saw that the masses elected representatives after full deliberation, repeated discussions, and careful comparisons. It was truly "choosing good people from among good people." The peasants said that this was electing "leaders of socialism." Through their representatives, the broad masses of people effectively participated in the management of national affairs, realizing the right to be masters of their own affairs. Is this imaginable in capitalist countries?
    One of the characteristics of our people's democratic dictatorship is that the leading personnel of our governments at all levels are produced by the people's congresses at all levels. Therefore, the staff of our government is responsible to the people, subject to the supervision of the people, and supported by the people. We ourselves, as representatives of the National People's Congress, participated in the work of formulating the constitution and many laws at the conference meetings, and discussed the government's work reports and budgets. We inspect twice a year, maintain close contact with the masses, and make criticisms and suggestions on the government's work. Every case is explained and every matter is settled. I feel the glory of being a person trusted by the people, and I also feel the weight of the people's entrustment. How should we make good efforts to be worthy of the glorious title of "people's representative."
    In Shaanxi, I have been to many rural areas and have seen with my own eyes that almost every household of farmers has new quilts and everyone has new clothes, and old ladies wear small-footed rubber shoes on rainy days. Almost every household has a thermos and a flashlight. They have all personally experienced the hardships of the old society and feel the sweetness of the new society. If anyone attempts to restore capitalism, pulling the people back to the old society where they were not clothed and not fed, allowing those reactionary rulers to continue to ride on the people's heads and act as dictators, the people will definitely resolutely defeat them!
    The people have seen through the souls and bones of the Rightists
    I do not intend to analyze the programs and spiritual essence of the Rightists in economy, law, culture, military affairs, diplomacy, ethnicity, and other aspects one by one here.
    Although these programs did not come from one person, did not come from one line, and did not come from one place, they echoed each other and cooperated closely. For example, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc. of the Democratic League wooed professors, and Huang Shaohong, etc. of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang instigated students; Huang Shaohong, etc. called for injustice for counter-revolutionaries, and Luo Longji suggested the establishment of a rehabilitation committee; Huang Shaohong said: Emphasizing achievements will cover up shortcomings, Chen Mingshu said: Only talking about shortcomings and not talking about achievements is in line with the spirit of rectification; Chu Anping slandered our country as a "party world," and Tan Tiwu suggested "do not set up a separate party system outside the government," and Yang Yuqing clamored for the Communist Party to "step down," and wanted to "break the horns of the party and criticize the scales of the party." Since they wanted to take the capitalist road, Long Yun would inevitably put forward the fallacies of undermining Sino-Soviet friendship and provoking ethnic unity. … They communicated from top to bottom, contacted frequently, colluded in many ways, expanded their influence, and strived to achieve the purpose of setting fires everywhere and causing chaos in the world.
    The above-mentioned unspeakable activities of the bourgeois Rightists have been exposed by the masses. Some Rightist generals are fighting and retreating, half-concealing and half-covering, attempting to muddle through and preserve their strength. Some are still without repentance, pretending to be dead by taking poison, stubbornly resisting, and regarding the Communist Party and revolutionary people as being欺骗. In fact, this is also another method and another way for them to carry out class struggle against the working class. We want to solemnly tell these Rightists with undying ambitions that our Communist Party is a party that has experienced storms and is moving from victory to victory; our people are highly conscious people who have been tempered by many revolutionary struggles. Especially in the eight years since liberation, after being tempered by several revolutionary movements and enjoying the fruits brought about by the revolution, their political sense of smell is sensitive, they have seen through your souls and bones, even if your masks are 多末 "gorgeous" and your singing is so "beautiful," they understand what a vicious heart is hidden behind all this. You have "designed" such and such roads for our motherland, but your roads all lead to capitalism; you have shot countless poisonous arrows here and there, but all the arrows are aimed at our eyes and hearts—the Chinese Communist Party. Has the Chinese Communist Party let you down? Has the working class let you down? No. For eight years, the people have not cared about your past, welcomed you into the ranks of the revolution, trusted you, given you high positions, and let you live a comfortable and luxurious life, hoping that you can wash your hearts and change your minds and follow the path pointed out by the working class. However, you are so ungrateful that you can't forget the bourgeois's selfish, greedy, and barbaric life all the time, and you actually want to use the opportunity of the Party to carry out rectification, in the name of anti-dogmatism, to oppose Marxism-Leninism; in the name of anti-bureaucratism, to oppose the socialist system; in the name of anti-sectarianism, to oppose the leadership of the Party. The overall purpose is to overthrow the Communist Party, overthrow the leading position of the working class, and let capitalism be restored in our country. Are you not madder than this? Perhaps some of you once thought that the explosion incident at Peking University Medical College, the murder case of counter-revolutionaries in Guantao County, Shandong Province, and the special agents planting time bombs in Guangzhou City were all military support for you; perhaps some people think that Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the capitalist countries of the United States and Britain are happy to praise and encourage you; but the vast working people of our country cannot tolerate your ugly performance! It is not allowed to continue performing on the great stage of our motherland!
  Finally, I want to solemnly warn all the Rightists that you have fallen from the inside of the people to the edge of the outside of the people, have been isolated, and have fallen apart. Whoever does not rein in at the brink of the precipice and thoroughly confess will cut himself off from the people. Finally, let me quote a famous saying of Gorky as a "gift" to you:
    "If the enemy does not surrender, then destroy it!"

    右派“大将”，休想蒙混过关！
    于振瀛的发言
    我们这次大会，是在我国第一个五年计划即将胜利完成的前夜召开的；我们这次大会，也是在我国人民反击右派的剧烈斗争中召开的。在开会之前，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告正式发表了。这是我们的指路灯，它照耀着全国人民前进的道路；这也是照妖镜，使一切魑魅魍魉现露原形。这是一个强大的思想和政治的武器，我们要学习、学习、再学习，从中吸取无穷无尽的力量，无情地打垮右派的猖狂进攻，取得社会主义事业的胜利。
    开会以来，我又听到了周总理的政府工作报告以及其他各项工作报告，我完全同意并拥护这些报告。周总理这个具有强大说服力的报告，是根据毛主席所提出的原则，以无可争辩的铁的事实，肯定了我国五大运动、三大改造和社会主义建设的辉煌成就，分析了我们前进道路上存在的困难和缺点，严正批判了右派分子反党反社会主义的反动言行，有利于全国人民在新的基础上的团结，加强了社会主义建设与社会主义改造的力量。
    享受着工人农民劳动成果的资产阶级右派分子，却演出了一幕反动大合唱
    在我国社会主义革命获得了决定性的胜利以后，中国共产党为了更进一步领导全国人民顺利地建成社会主义社会，使我们的国家更加美好、更加壮丽；为了发挥社会主义制度的优越性，使我国人民能够逐步地随着生产的增长，提高物质生活和文化生活的水平。但这一伟大而艰巨的工作，是和我们的积极的、创造性的劳动分不开的；因而党适时地提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督”的方针，要求团结一切可以团结的力量，动员一切可能动员的积极因素，为社会主义建设而共同奋斗。为了贯彻这一方针，党在已经准备好了条件的基础上，首先提出了党的整风，并号召一切非党人士积极帮助党进行整风，要把党员中存在的某些官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义整掉，使党的组织更纯洁、党的领导力量更增强；同时也要求在这一整风的过程中，让广大群众在斗争的风雨里受到教育、锻炼、培养，提高群众的革命觉悟和斗争能力；这完全体现了中国共产党是一切从人民利益出发的党，是最坚决地、始终不懈地推动着社会历史前进的党，是伟大、光荣、正确的党。这样的整风运动，是历史上任何政党所没有、也不可能有的。然而生活在社会主义制度下，并且享受着工人、农民创造的劳动成果的资产阶级右派分子，却竟然在这整风运动的进程中，演出了一幕反动大合唱。这是当前政治和思想领域中的一场严重的阶级斗争，是在我国进行恢复资本主义制度的危险的尝试。但是他们的估计是大错特错了！他们的阶级局限性，使他们“利令智昏”，看不见经过了将近四十年的艰苦斗争，已经锻炼成为政治上成熟的、坚不可破的党；看不见全国工人、农民、革命知识分子和各族人民已经紧紧地团结在共产党的周围，如同保护自己的眼珠一样，保护着领导自己前进、为自己创造幸福的党。因而他们不了解，无论他们向社会主义猖狂进攻的手法如何巧妙，隐蔽得多么严密，也遮掩不了已经觉悟了的中国人民的眼睛，恐吓不了已经站起来的中国人民的战斗意志。
    右派阴谋的内幕不断被揭发出来
    全国规模的反右派斗争，正在以堂堂之阵、正正之旗，雷厉风行的开展起来了。在一个月的时间内，吹散了右派分子所放出的黑云毒雾，使全国的政治空气为之一新，广大群众真正感到红日当头，春风送暖。右派分子真正成了“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，其阴谋内幕不断被揭发出来。人们看到，右派分子，特别是那些头面人物、骨干分子，兴风作浪、到处放火的本事了。他们里应外合，造成八方风雨；妄想逐鹿中原，夺取权力，狼子野心，阴狠已极。这是因为我们所面对的右派，并不是简单的、平常的右派，而是联合起来有组织的右派。章伯钧、罗隆基就是他们的“三军统帅”。他们的政治基础是民盟、农工、民革等民主党派，他们的社会基础是失掉了生产资料的资产阶级分子、旧军政人员以及尚未改造过来的资产阶级知识分子，包括一部分缺乏阶级斗争经验的学生、青年等。就在这样一些基础之上，右派集团建立了一个遍布全国的阴谋活动系统，准备力量，伺机而发。
    右派不仅有组织、有计划，而且有全面的纲领。反党的领导、反社会主义、反人民民主专政，就是他们的总纲；总纲之下，在政治、经济、法律、文化、军事、外交、民族等各方面，还有具体的实际纲领。
    纲领是需要理论根据的，章乃器就是他们的最大的理论家。他们说，马克思、列宁都没有看见过原子，所以马列主义过时了。他们说，资本主义有政治民主，社会主义就会造成官僚主义，资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子没有什么本质的不同，资产阶级已经没有两面性，定息不是剥削等等。所有这一切“理论”，都是反对社会主义，为资本主义开辟道路的根据。
    右派攻击国家的基本制度是在铜墙铁壁上碰头
    “革命的根本问题是政权问题”，敌人和我们都懂得这个道理，因此，右派分子首先攻击我们国家的基本制度，以夺取工人阶级的领导权，建立资产阶级专政的政权为其最大、最终的目标。
    以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政和国家机关的民主集中制，是我们国家的基本制度。右派分子却专门进攻这个基本制度。以章、罗同盟为首的右派分子要以资产阶级的领导代替共产党的领导，以“绝对民主”代替民主集中。因此，他们说，无产阶级专政是三害的最后根源，提出“政治设计院”、“党天下”、“轮流执政”、不该“在政权之外再搞一套党的系统”、“请共产党下台”等荒谬主张。他们企图破坏工农联盟，故意渲染农民和政府的矛盾。他们自以为除了恭请资产阶级上台执政，给章、罗、章等黄袍加身以外，还有别的什么办法呢！
    然而，人民是不答应的。几十年来，多少革命先烈，流血牺牲；今天，全国劳动人民辛勤劳动的革命胜利果实，是不能轻易送人的。谁有胆量敢来轻于尝试，谁一定会在人民的铜墙铁壁前面，碰得头破血流。
    以视察中所见事实驳斥右派对人民代表大会制度的诬蔑
    我在去年和今年，曾经两次到西北和西南地区，视察了人民代表大会的工作，在这里，我愿意就自己亲见亲闻的若干事实，来驳斥右派分子对于人民代表大会制度的种种诬蔑。
    他们说：“资本主义有政治民主”，言外之意，社会主义就没有政治民主了。我们的看法恰恰相反。拿选举来说，资产阶级的选举，都是花钱收买的，他们的目的，就是争权夺利。他们既然是花钱竞选，当选后，必然千方百计设法多捞些钱回来。他们的行为和人民的利益，是根本相违背的。他们的“民主”，只能是打着选举这块假招牌，来干着分赃收买、互相勾结的勾当。
    我们的社会主义民主是真正的民主。我在云南、四川、陕西视察中看到，参加选举的人，政治热情空前高涨，投票率达到百分之九十四以上。比一九五三年高得多。我看到群众选举代表，都经过充分的酝酿，反复的讨论，认真的评比，真是“好人里面选好人”。农民们说，这是选“社会主义的带头人”。广大人民通过他们的代表，切实参与国家大事的管理工作，实现了当家作主的权利。在资本主义国家，这是可以想像的吗？
    我们的人民民主专政特点之一，我们政府各级领导人员，是各级人民代表大会产生出来的。因此，我们政府的工作人员，是对人民负责，受人民的监督，并得到人民的拥护的。我们自己身为全国人民代表大会代表，在大会会议上，参加了制定宪法和许多法令的工作，讨论政府工作报告和预决算。我们每年两次视察，经常和群众保持密切联系，对政府工作提出批评和意见，案案都有交代，事事都有着落。我感到作一个人民所信任的人的光荣，也感到了人民付托之重。我们应当如何善自努力，才能对得起“人民代表”这个光荣的称号。
    我在陕西，到过许多农村，亲眼看到农民们几乎家家都有新被，人人有新衣，老太太们下雨天也穿上了小脚胶鞋。家家户户，几乎都有热水瓶、手电筒。他们都是亲身吃尽了旧社会的苦，分外感到新社会的甜。谁要企图资本主义复辟，把人民拉回到衣不遮体、食不充饥的旧社会里去，让那些反动统治者仍旧骑在人民的头上作威作福的话，人民一定会坚决地打垮它！
    人民看透了右派分子的灵魂和骨头
    关于右派分子在经济、法律、文化、军事、外交、民族等方面的纲领及其精神实质，我不预备在这里一一分析了。
    这些纲领，虽然并非出自一人之口，并非来自一条线，出自一个地方，但他们是互相呼应、紧密配合的。例如民盟的章伯钧、罗隆基等拉拢教授，民革的黄绍竑等就煽动学生；黄绍竑等为反革命分子喊冤叫屈，罗隆基就建议成立平反委员会；黄绍竑说：强调成绩就会掩盖缺点，陈铭枢说：只谈缺点不谈成绩才符合整风精神；储安平诬蔑我们的国家是“党天下”，谭惕吾就建议“不要在政权之外再搞一套党的系统”，杨玉清就叫嚣要共产党“下台”，要“折党之角，批党之鳞”。他们既然要走资本主义的道路，龙云就必然会提出破坏中苏友谊，挑拨民族团结的谬论。……他们是上下沟通，接触频繁，多方串通，扩大影响，务期达到到处点火，使天下大乱的目的。
    上述种种资产阶级右派分子的不可告人的勾当，已经被群众揭发出来了。一些右派大将，有的在且战且走，半遮半掩，企图蒙混过关，保存实力。有的仍然毫无愧悟，服毒装死，负隅顽抗，以共产党和革命人民为可欺。其实，这也就是他们对工人阶级进行阶级斗争的又一种手法、一种方式。我们要正告这些野心不死的右派分子，我们的共产党，是久经风雨，从胜利走向胜利的党；我们的人民，是经过多次革命斗争锻炼的、有高度觉悟的人民。特别是在解放后八年来，经过几次革命运动的锻炼，享受到革命带来的成果，他们的政治嗅觉是灵敏的，他们看透了你们的灵魂和骨头，尽管你们的脸谱化装得多末
  “华丽”，尽管你们的唱腔如何“美妙”，他们懂得隐藏在这一切后面的，是一副如何恶毒的心肠，你们给我们祖国“设计”了这样、那样的道路，但是你们的条条道路都通向资本主义；你们向这里、那里射出了无数支毒箭，但是，箭箭都对准我们的眼珠和心脏——中国共产党。难道中国共产党对不起你们吗？难道工人阶级对不起你们吗？没有。八年以来，人民不计较你们的过去，欢迎你们到革命的行列里来，信任你们，给你们以高高在上的地位，让你们过着舒适华贵的生活，希望你们能够洗心革面，脱胎换骨，跟着工人阶级指引的道路走。然而你们竟忘恩负义，时刻忘记不了资产阶级唯利是图、贪得无厌的野蛮生活，居然想利用党进行整风的时机，以反教条主义为名，来反对马列主义；以反官僚主义为名来反对社会主义制度；以反宗派主义为名来反对党的领导。总的目的是搞垮共产党，搞垮工人阶级的领导地位，让资本主义在我国复辟，丧心病狂，孰过于此。也许你们中曾有人认为北大医学院的爆炸事件、山东馆陶县的反革命分子杀人案件、广州市的特务放定时炸弹，都是对你们的武力支援；也许还有人认为台湾、香港和美、英资本主义国家对你们的赞赏、打气而高兴；但我国广大的劳动人民对你们这种丑恶的表演是无法容忍的！决不容许在我们祖国的大好舞台上继续表演下去！
  最后，我要正告一切右派分子，你们已经从人民内部堕落到人民外部的边缘上了，已经陷于孤立、陷于瓦解了，谁要是不悬崖勒马，彻底交代，谁就会自绝于人民。最后让我引用高尔基的一句名言，作为对你们的“赠言”吧：
    “假如敌人不投降，那就消灭它！”
