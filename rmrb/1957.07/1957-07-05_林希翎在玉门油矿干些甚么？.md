To the Editor:
    With indignation, I expose the anti-socialist activities of Lin Xiling, a rightist and student of the Law Department of the China People's University, at the Yumen Oil Mine.
    In August of last year, Lin Xiling came to the Yumen Oil Mine as a "special correspondent for the China Youth Daily" to conduct interviews. However, this "reporter" was very different from other reporters. As soon as she arrived at the Yumen Oil Mine, she started fires everywhere, causing a great disturbance in Yumen Oil Mine. Every time she saw a worker, she would ask, "Do you have any grievances? Don't be afraid, speak up, and I will appeal on your behalf." She once publicly slandered the work of the Yumen Oil Mine as "a complete mess" and insulted the leaders of the Yumen Oil Mine as thoroughgoing bureaucrats, saying that these bureaucrats "should all be shot." Even worse, she casually issued orders at the Yumen Oil Mine. For example, a young person in the Geological Survey Office's field exploration team applied to join the Youth League. Although the branch meeting had already approved it, the Youth League Committee did not immediately approve it at the time because the historical issues had not been fully clarified. After Lin Xiling learned about this matter, she questioned the Youth League Committee of the Geological Survey Office: "Why didn't you approve her joining the Youth League? I am a reporter for the China Youth Daily, and I demand that you resolve this issue in the shortest possible time, otherwise I will write 'pepper' (referring to the satirical supplement of the China Youth Daily) about you."
    Lin Xiling's words and actions at the Yumen Oil Mine aroused suspicion among many comrades at the time, especially her focus on finding "pepper" material, which was incomprehensible. Recently, we learned from the People's Daily the essence of her anti-socialist remarks, which was an attempt to overthrow our socialist system.
    Is it that our Yumen Oil Mine has nothing worth praising? No. At the time of Lin Xiling's visit to the Yumen Oil Mine, the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine was changing rapidly day by day: trains had just arrived at the Yumen Oil Mine, and crude oil was directly transported eastward by train; the world's most advanced scientific and technological achievement—atomic energy logging—began to be used in the Yumen Oil Mine, and the double-barrel inclined wells jointly drilled by Chinese and Soviet drilling workers also continuously achieved new records; especially with the in-depth development of the advanced producer movement, a large number of advanced producers emerged in the Yumen Oil Mine... Aren't these worth reporting? Only those who wear tinted glasses cannot see these earth-shaking changes in the Yumen Oil Mine.
    Lin Xiling not only did not write about the good people and good deeds of the Yumen Oil Mine herself, but also opposed others from writing about them. Yao Bingjian, a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency stationed at the mine, once sent a message "Yumen Oil Mine Improves the Lives of Field Workers in Many Ways" (completely in line with the facts, which was published in the People's Daily), but Lin Xiling insulted Comrade Yao Bingjian face to face as "fabricating facts," and she believed that "the lives of field personnel have not been improved."
    This is Lin Xiling's true face. As a citizen who supports the Party and socialism, I should expose it!

### 林希翎在玉门油矿干些甚么？

    林希翎在玉门油矿干些甚么？编辑同志：
    我以愤慨的心情，揭发中国人民大学法律系学生、右派分子林希翎在玉门油矿的反社会主义活动。
    去年8月份，林希翎以“中国青年报特约记者”的身份来玉门油矿采访。可是这位“记者”和别的记者大不相同，她一到玉门油矿就到处点火，闹得玉门油矿满城风雨。她每见一个工人就问：“有冤吗？不要怕，说出来，我为你申诉。”她曾经公开侮蔑玉门油矿的工作是“一团糟”，辱骂玉门油矿的领导都是些彻头彻尾的官僚主义者，并说这些官僚主义者“都应该枪毙”。更恶劣的是，她随便在玉门油矿发号施令。例如地质调查处野外勘探队有一个青年申请入团，虽然支部大会已经通过，但因为历史问题还没有完全搞清，团委当时就没有立即批准。林希翎知道这件事情以后，就质问地质调查处团委：“你们为什么不批准她入团？我是中国青年报的记者，限你们在最短期间内解决这个问题，否则我就要给你们写‘辣椒’（指的是中国青年报的讽刺副刊）了。”
    林希翎在玉门油矿的这些言论和行动，当时就引起很多同志的怀疑，特别是对她专找“辣椒”材料这一点不可理解。最近，我们从人民日报上才知道她发表的反社会主义言论的实质，就是企图推翻我们的社会主义制度。
    是不是我们玉门油矿没有什么值得歌颂的呢？不是。就在林希翎访问玉门油矿的那个时候，玉门油矿的建设正在日新月异地变化：火车刚刚通到玉门油矿，原油直接用火车东运；世界上最先进的科学技术成就——原子能测井开始在玉门油矿运用，中苏钻井工作者合钻的双筒斜向井也连续出现了新纪录；特别是随着先进生产者运动的深入开展，玉门油矿涌现出大批的先进生产者……难道这些都不值得报道吗？只有带着有色眼镜的人，才看不到玉门油矿这些翻天复地的变化。
    林希翎不但自己不写玉门油矿的好人好事，反而反对别人写。新华社驻矿记者姚秉鉴同志曾发过一条“玉门油矿多方改善野外工作人员生活”的消息（完全符合事实，曾刊登在人民日报上），可是林希翎当面就侮蔑姚秉鉴同志是“捏造事实”，她认为“野外人员的生活并没有改善”。
    林希翎的真实面目就是这样。作为一个拥护党和社会主义的公民，我应该把它揭发出来！
