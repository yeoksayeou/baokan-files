Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Ethnic regional autonomy has been realized in areas inhabited by various ethnic minorities across nearly five million square kilometers of land. From Hainan Island in the south of the motherland to Xinjiang on the northwestern border, from the Inner Mongolian grasslands to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, all places implementing ethnic regional autonomy account for nearly half of the total land area of the country.

According to statistics, two autonomous regions, thirty-one autonomous prefectures, and fifty-four autonomous counties have been established nationwide. More than 40 million people live in these ethnic autonomous areas, including more than 22 million ethnic minorities, encompassing over forty ethnic groups such as Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Zhuang, Uyghur, Miao, and Yi.

Inner Mongolia, the first to achieve regional autonomy, recently solemnly celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region. To benefit the development of the Mongolian ethnicity and enhance ethnic unity, the area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been continuously expanded in recent years, and the population has increased from more than 2 million when the autonomous region was first established to more than 8.7 million.

The Uyghur ethnic group in the northwestern border region established an autonomous region in 1955. Other ethnic minorities within this autonomous region have also established eleven autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties.

The Tibetan ethnic group, one of the major ethnic groups in the country, has successively established nine autonomous prefectures and two autonomous counties in Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan. In addition, it has jointly established an autonomous prefecture with the Mongolian and Kazakh ethnic groups. The Tibet region, where the Tibetan people live in concentrated communities, also established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region last year.

In the multi-ethnic regions of Yunnan and Guizhou, the Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Bai, Hani, Kawa, Miao, Buyi, Dong, and other ethnic groups have established autonomous areas.

The Hui people, the most widely distributed ethnic group, have established four autonomous prefectures and nine autonomous counties so far. In addition, they have jointly established an autonomous county with the Yi and Miao ethnic groups. Preparations are now underway to establish a Hui autonomous region at the provincial level.

The Zhuang ethnic group, the most populous among the ethnic minorities, established the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province four years ago. Soon, the original Guangxi Province will be reorganized into the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Currently, about 90% of the areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities have realized ethnic regional autonomy. The remaining ethnic minority areas are expected to establish ethnic autonomous areas by the end of 1958.

Small ethnic minority communities scattered in vast rural areas, although unable to establish ethnic autonomous areas, have generally established ethnic townships to carry out various tasks based on the special circumstances of the ethnic composition.

    全国近半地区实现民族区域自治
    新华社5日讯　在近五百万平方公里的土地上，聚居的各少数民族已经实现了民族区域自治。从祖国南端的海南岛，到西北边陲的新疆，从内蒙古草原到云贵高原，所有实行民族区域自治的地方，占全国土地总面积将近一半。
    根据统计，全国已经建立两个自治区，三十一个自治州，和五十四个自治县。有四千多万人民生活在这些民族自治地方，其中少数民族有二千二百多万，包括蒙古、回、藏、僮、维吾尔、苗、彝等四十多个民族。
    最早实现区域自治的内蒙古，不久以前曾经隆重地纪念了自治区建立十周年。为了有利于蒙古民族的发展，和增进民族团结，内蒙古自治区的区域，近年来续有扩大，人口也从刚建立自治区时的二百多万人增加到八百七十多万。
    西北边陲的维吾尔族，在1955年建立了自治区。在这个自治区内的其他少数民族，也已分别建立了十一个自治州和自治县。
    国内主要民族之一的藏族，已先后在青海、四川、甘肃、云南建立九个自治州和两个自治县，另外还同蒙古、哈萨克族联合建立了一个自治州。藏族人民聚居地的西藏，去年也已成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。
    在多民族的云南、贵州，傣、景颇、傈僳、白、哈尼、佧佤、苗、布依、侗等民族，都分别建立了自治地方。
    分布最广的回族人民，到目前为止，在各地已建立四个自治州，九个自治县，另外还同彝族、苗族联合建立了一个自治县，现在又将筹备建立一个相当省级的回族自治区。
    各少数民族当中人口最多的僮族，早在四年前就成立广西省桂西僮族自治州，不久，原广西省将要改建为广西僮族自治区。
    现在，全国约90％左右的少数民族聚居地方，已实现了民族区域自治，其余的少数民族聚居地区，预计到1958年的年底，都将全部建立起民族自治地方。
    散布在广大农村的小块少数民族聚居地，虽然不能建立民族自治地方，但也已普遍设立民族乡，依据民族成份的特殊情况，来开展各项工作。
