Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 20th: People in the Xuchang, Shangqiu, and Kaifeng regions of Henan Province continue to fight the floods and are making great efforts to rescue disaster-stricken people.

In the past two days, the water levels of the Shahe River in Luohe City and Zhoukou City have been fluctuating around the guaranteed water level. The upstream areas of the Shahe River, Yinghe River, Jialu River, and other rivers experienced rain the day before yesterday and yesterday. Therefore, the tense situation in the Shahe River remains quite severe. Party and government organizations along the river are still leading the vast population in holding the levees and fighting the floods.

In Shangqiu and Kaifeng regions, each county has experienced between 400 and 500 millimeters of rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding. In addition, the Wohe River and its tributary, the Huiji River, have overflowed due to particularly large floods, causing many villages in counties such as Sui, Qi, Zhe, and Ningling to be surrounded by water. Currently, efforts are being concentrated from the province to the counties to carry out rescue work. The Department of Transportation has dispatched sixty wooden boats to Qi County, Ningling, and Sui County to establish a joint flood control headquarters. Four hundred and twenty-five young people have formed a rescue team, leading 6,760 people, using 390 self-made wooden rafts to carry out rescues, and have already rescued nearly 26,000 people, more than 30,000 livestock, and more than 2.3 million jin of grain.

Flood control and rescue work in Henan has received strong support from the People's Liberation Army and other regions. The Infantry School stationed in Shangqiu has dispatched six rubber boats to participate in the rescue. An air force unit has airdropped ten rubber boats to Sui County and fifty-eight rubber boats to Qi County, and has also transferred two motorboats. The people of Qi County are very grateful for the support of the People's Liberation Army. The people of Chengguan in Qi County said: "In the history of Qi County, airplanes have dropped things three times: the Japanese dropped bombs, Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army airdropped bullets, and the People's Liberation Army dropped rubber boats."

Of the 200,000 grass bags provided by the Central Flood Control Headquarters, 150,000 have been transported to Luohekou. The 10,000 grass bags provided by the Huai River Management Committee are also being rushed to Zhoukou City.

    河南大力抢救灾民
    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省许昌、商丘、开封等专区人民继续和洪水斗争，大力抢救受灾群众。
    这两天，沙河漯河市和周口市的水位，一直是徘徊在保证水位上下，前天和昨天，沙河和颍河、贾鲁等河的上游地区又在下雨，因此，沙河的紧张形势仍相当严重。沿河的党、政机关仍在领导广大人民坚守着堤线，和洪水搏斗着。
    商丘和开封专区各县下了四百多到五百多公厘的雨，积水成灾，加上涡河及其支流惠济河因洪水特别大而漫溢，以致雎、?、柘、宁陵等县好多村庄被水包围，现在从省到县正集中力量进行抢救工作。交通厅派六十只木船到?县、宁陵和雎县成立了联合防汛指挥部，有四百二十五名青年组成了抢险队，带领着六千七百六十人，用自编的三百九十个木筏进行抢救，已抢救出近二万六千人、三万多头牲口，二百三十万多斤粮食。
    河南的防汛和抢救工作，得到解放军和外地的大力支援。驻商丘的步兵学校派出六只橡皮船参加抢救，空军某部已向睢县空投橡皮船十只，向?县空投了橡皮船五十八只，还调去汽船二只。?县群众对解放军这样的支援非常感激，?县城关的群众说：“在?县的历史上飞机来投过三次东西：日本投过炸弹，蒋介石的第五军空投过子弹，人民解放军投橡皮船。”
    中央防汛总指挥部支援的二十万条草袋，已有十五万条运到漯河口，治淮委员会支援的草袋一万条，也正在向周口市赶运。
