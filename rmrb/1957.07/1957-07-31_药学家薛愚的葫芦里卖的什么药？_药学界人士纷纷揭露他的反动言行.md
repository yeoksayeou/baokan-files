    Pharmacist Xue Yu's Reactionary Words and Deeds Exposed by Pharmacy Professionals

    (Our Dispatch) Recently, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Beijing Medical College held meetings respectively to expose the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Xue Yu, a director of the Pharmaceutical Association and director of the Department of Pharmacy at Beijing Medical College.

    Many comrades revealed that around the time the rectification campaign began, Xue Yu published a series of articles and made statements with malicious intent, viciously attacking the Party's policies and the Ministry of Health. He said the Ministry of Health was a "Party's world," that the "heads of the Ministry of Health, from ministers, directors, section chiefs, etc., are all Party members," that they "don't understand politics and are even more technically incompetent," and that they also "don't trust and don't use non-Party intellectuals," and "don't value non-Party experts." He also intentionally distorted facts to provoke discord, saying that "the Ministry of Health has abandoned the Four Guidelines and stipulated 'medical treatment as the main focus'," "thus causing the pain and disaster of nurses, pharmacies, radiology, laboratory, and other departments."

    In his articles, Xue Yu painted a completely dark picture of the pharmaceutical industry and pharmacy work. Xue Yu also viciously attacked, saying that under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, all pharmaceutical institutions were discriminated against, and the Ministry of Health was dragging the pharmaceutical industry back to the eighteenth century. He also said: "Pharmaceutical workers see no sunlight year after year, and are constantly battered by storms, and have long been unable to voice their grievances or shed their tears." He incited pharmaceutical workers to "stand tall" and "pour out our grievances," attempting to stir up dissatisfaction with the Party among pharmaceutical workers.

    This year, Xue Yu, in his capacity as a representative of the National People's Congress, inspected pharmacy work in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan and other places, and he used this opportunity to carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities. Wu Zhongshu of Beijing Medical College revealed that Xue Yu specifically sought out hospitals with many problems to inspect, and the condition for his inspection was that the hospital director should not accompany him. The directors of the pharmacies of Beijing People's Hospital, Children's Hospital, Beijing Medical College Affiliated Hospital, and Peking Union Medical College said that when Xue Yu inspected the hospitals, he only looked at the old, not the new; only looked at the bad, not the good, and was not interested in all the materials the hospital prepared for him about the pharmacy, but repeatedly asked: What are your grievances? Is anyone oppressing you? How is your treatment? I am a people's representative, you can tell me your grievances. Wu Zhongshu said: He also liked to talk to people who were dissatisfied with the leadership, and often took the complaints about the leadership collected in Hospital A and spread them to Hospital B, making provocative questions. Once, a person dissatisfied with the Party said to Xue Yu: Doctors become more specialized as they study, but pharmacists are managing wider and wider ranges of fields. When Xue Yu inspected the second hospital, the first thing he asked was: Do you have the view here that "pharmacists are managing wider and wider ranges of fields"? Xue Yu also provoked everywhere, saying: "The pharmacy profession is being discriminated against." Sun Enhua of Beijing Medical College Affiliated Hospital said that Xue Yu incited staff at Beijing Medical College Affiliated Hospital to write big-character posters, saying, "If you have opinions, raise them. If you can't write big-character posters, ask the students from Beijing Medical College who are interning here to write them. There are plenty of experts in writing big-character posters among the students!" On the one hand, Xue Yu provoked pharmacy workers to oppose the Party in the guise of a "savior"; on the other hand, he incited pharmacy students to cause trouble in the guise of a "benevolent mentor," deliberately creating problems for the Ministry of Health. You Daixiang of Beijing People's Hospital said that Xue Yu once said to the graduates of the two-year pharmacy program: "I very much agree to let you come back to study, but the Ministry of Health does not agree." He once said to the fourth-year pharmacy students, "I don't agree with you going to the pharmacy, but the Ministry of Health wants to do this." This time, after Xue Yu published his inflammatory articles in the Health News and the Pharmaceutical Bulletin, he stirred up a fire among the pharmacy students.

    Gao Zhenge of Beijing Medical College said that when the students felt that the current pharmacy major setting was unreasonable, and asked to change majors and extend the length of schooling, causing a great uproar, Xue Yu not only did not persuade the students, but instead added fuel to the fire, inciting them by saying: You are speaking out loudly and well, but it is not enough, you must continue to speak out"! Xue Yu also asked the Ministry of Health to "make a prompt decision and resolve the matter quickly," and said that "the Department of Pharmacy must overcome all difficulties to achieve the students' goals." When the fourth-year pharmacy students were causing trouble by boycotting class meetings, Xue Yu, as the department head, not only did not stop them, but instead told the students that after the new building of the college was completed, the Department of Pharmacy could separate from the school and become independent. He wanted to become the president as soon as possible.

    What kind of person is Xue Yu really? He joined the Kuomintang in 1925 and served as an advisor to the Three People's Principles Youth League of the pseudo-National Pharmaceutical College. Chen Xinxian, editor of the Pharmaceutical Bulletin, said: In the Pharmaceutical Association, Xue Yu is a ringleader. He tried every means to use the Pharmaceutical Association as a tool to achieve his personal goals, and even used the Pharmaceutical Association to confront the Ministry of Health. For example, he sought to become an academician of the Academy of Sciences, wanted the Pharmaceutical Association to express its views, and did not want the Department of Pharmacy of Beijing Medical College to move to Taiyuan, and so on.

    Shen Jie of Beijing Medical College said that at the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, Xue Yu once said to others: Why don't you defend Chu Anping's "Party's world" statement? He himself also wrote an article defending Chu Anping's "Party's world" statement, but he has not published it yet.

### 药学家薛愚的葫芦里卖的什么药？  药学界人士纷纷揭露他的反动言行

    药学家薛愚的葫芦里卖的什么药？
    药学界人士纷纷揭露他的反动言行
    本报讯　最近，中国药学会和北京医学院分别召开会议，揭露药学会理事、北京医学院药学系主任薛愚的反共反社会主义言行。
    许多同志揭露说：在整风开始前后，薛愚发表了一系列用心险恶的文章和言论，恶毒地攻击党的方针政策，攻击卫生部。他说卫生部是“党天下”，卫生部“上自部长、司长、科长等头目都是党员”，“政治不懂、技术更不行”，而且还“不信任、不使用党外知识分子”，“不重视非党专家”。他还有意歪曲事实地挑拨说，“卫生部抛弃了四大方针，而规定了‘医疗为主’，”“因而造成护士、药房、放射、化验等科室的痛苦和灾难。”
    薛愚在文章里，把药学事业和药房工作说得一团漆黑。薛愚还恶毒地攻击说，在卫生部的领导下，药学机构无一不受到歧视，卫生部要药学事业向后拖到十八世纪。他还说：“药工人员成年累月的见不着太阳，同时又不断地受着狂风暴雨的吹打，早已是有冤无处诉，有泪无处洒。”他煽动药工人员“挺起胸来”，“吐尽我们的苦水”，企图在药工人员中煽动起不满意党的情绪。
    薛愚今年曾以全国人民代表大会代表的身份，到北京、天津、武汉等地视察药房工作，他利用这个机会进行反共反社会主义的活动。北京医学院吴忠恕揭露说，薛愚专找问题多的医院视察，而且视察时的条件是，不要院长陪同。北京人民医院、儿童医院、北医附属医院、协和医学院的药房主任说，薛愚到医院视察的时候，不看新的，只看旧的；不看好的，只看坏的，对医院给他准备的有关药房的全部材料也不感兴趣，却是再三地去问：你们有什么苦处？有没有人压迫你们？待遇怎样？我是人民代表，你们有什么苦处都可以对我说。吴忠恕说：他还爱找对领导不满的人谈话，而且常常把在甲医院收集到的埋怨领导的话，带到乙医院去散布，作挑拨性的发问。有一次一个不满意党的人对薛愚说：医师越修越专，药师愈管愈宽。薛愚到第二个医院视察时，头一句话就问：你们这里有没有“药师越管越宽”的看法。薛愚还到处挑拨说：“药学专业被歧视”。北医附属医院孙恩华说，薛愚在北京医学院附属医院煽动工作人员写大字报，说“你们有意见就提呀，不会写大字报，请北医在你们这里实习的同学写，学生里有的是写大字报的专家！”薛愚一面以“救世主”的姿态挑拨药工人员反对党；一面又以“仁慈导师”的面貌煽动药学系学生闹事，故意给卫生部出难题。北京人民医院游代祥说，薛愚一次对两年制药专的毕业生说：“我很同意让你们回来学习，可是卫生部不答应”。他又一次对药学系四年级学生说，“我不同意你们到药房，可是卫生部要这样做”。这次，当薛愚在健康报、药学通报发表了他的煽动性的文章以后，他就又在药学系学生中煽起一把火来。
    北京医学院高振阁说，当学生们认为目前的药学专业设置不合理，要求改专业，延长学制，闹得天翻地覆的时候，薛愚不仅不对学生进行说服教育，反而火上加油地煽动说：你们鸣得响，放得好，但还不够，还要继续鸣放”！薛愚也要求卫生部“当机立断，速战速决”，并说“药学系要克服一切困难来达到学生的目的”。当药学系四年级学生闹着罢免班会时，身为系主任的薛愚，不但不制止，反而对学生说，学院新房落成后，药学系可以脱离学校独立出来。他想早日当上院长。
    薛愚究竟是怎么样的人物呢？他在1925年参加过国民党，曾任伪国立药专三青团顾问。药学通报编辑陈新谦说：在药学会里，薛愚是个把头，他想尽一切办法利用药学会作为达到个人企图的工具，甚至利用药学会同卫生部抗衡。如他争取当科学院学部委员，要药学会发表意见，不叫北京医学院药学系迁太原等等。
    北京医学院沈节说：在反右派斗争开始时，薛愚还曾对人说：你们为什么不为储安平“党天下”的说法辩护？他自己还写了一篇为储安平“党天下”辩护的文章，不过到现在还没有发表。
