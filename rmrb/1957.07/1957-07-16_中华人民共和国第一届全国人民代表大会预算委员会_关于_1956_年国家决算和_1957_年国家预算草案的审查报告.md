The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
Report on the Examination of the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft
(Passed by the Budget Committee on July 12, 1957)
Chairman of the Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress: Cheng Zihua
The Budget Committee of the First National People's Congress began examining the drafts of the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft submitted by the State Council from late May this year. During this meeting, it also listened to the report by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, on the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft. Based on the opinions raised by the delegates during the discussions, it conducted research and examination of the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft. Now, on behalf of the Budget Committee, I will report the results of the examination as follows:

The 1956 National Final Accounts submitted by the State Council show a total revenue of 29,754,444,000 yuan and a total expenditure of 30,574,138,000 yuan, with expenditure exceeding revenue by 819,694,000 yuan. The Budget Committee thoroughly examined the figures of the 1956 National Final Accounts and agreed with the analysis of the 1956 National Final Accounts made by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, in his report. The completion of the 1956 National Budget revenue was generally good, the allocation and use of expenditure were basically correct, and the solutions to address the deficit were generally appropriate. Although there were some shortcomings in the execution of the national budget in 1956, these shortcomings were of minor importance compared to the great achievements made in 1956. The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress approve the 1956 National Final Accounts.

The Budget Committee believes that the several points of experience in financial work in 1956 summarized by Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, are of great significance for improving future work. It should be pointed out that the financial departments should pay more attention to the study and summarization of the above-mentioned experiences in the future to further improve and enhance their work.

The Budget Committee thoroughly examined the 1957 National Budget Draft and believes that the figures for various revenues and expenditures listed in the draft are generally appropriate, and the overall arrangement of revenue and expenditure is prudent and also positive. The Budget Committee believes that adjustments can be considered in certain aspects of revenue and expenditure as follows:

(I) On the revenue side, industrial and commercial tax revenue should be increased by 150 million yuan, railway enterprise revenue should be increased by 73 million yuan; agricultural tax revenue should be reduced by 50 million yuan, textile industry revenue should be reduced by 57.052 million yuan, and forestry industry revenue should be reduced by 14.4948 million yuan. After offsetting the increase and decrease in revenue, the net increase in revenue is 100.1 million yuan. The itemized explanation is as follows:

	1. The industrial production and commodity circulation in the first five months of this year have been relatively good. It is estimated that this year's industrial and commercial tax revenue can be increased by 200 million yuan compared to the figures listed in the budget draft. In addition, this year's cotton yarn production may not be able to complete the plan, and it is estimated that industrial and commercial tax revenue will be reduced by 50 million yuan. After offsetting the above increase and decrease, tax revenue will increase by 150 million yuan.

	2. The Ministry of Railways' transportation plan and financial plan have been completed relatively well in the first five months of this year, which is inseparable from the railway enterprises' active implementation of the economic accounting system. On this basis, it is possible to exceed the completion of the financial revenue plan through further increasing production and practicing economy. Therefore, it is recommended that the railway enterprise revenue be approved for an increase of 73 million yuan.

	3. The agricultural tax revenue listed in the 1957 National Budget Draft includes the portion of the proceeds from the sale of autumn grain requisitioned in 1957 that will be used this year. Considering that if this portion of the proceeds from the sale of grain is used too much this year, it will affect the budget revenue for next year, and the execution of the national budget in the first five months of this year is also relatively good. Therefore, it is recommended that the portion of the proceeds from the sale of autumn grain requisitioned in 1957 in the agricultural tax revenue be reduced by 50 million yuan.

	4. The national economic plan for this year stipulates that the output of cotton yarn should be 4.635 million pieces. Due to the insufficient supply of raw cotton, it seems difficult to complete this plan. Now, on the one hand, the relevant departments should be urged to overcome the difficulties and strive to complete the established production plan; on the other hand, the national budget revenue should be appropriately adjusted according to the reliable and achievable output so that the national budget is placed on a fully reliable foundation. In addition to what has already been said, reducing the industrial and commercial tax revenue related to cotton yarn by 50 million yuan, it is recommended that the profit income of the textile industry (including state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private textile enterprises) be reduced by 57.052 million yuan.

	5. In the 1957 forestry industry revenue, there is a possibility that the amount listed in the budget draft will not be completed because the average selling price of timber is calculated too high. Therefore, it is recommended that the forestry industry revenue be reduced by 14.4948 million yuan.

(II) On the expenditure side, it is recommended that the 1957 National Budget expenditure also be approved for an increase of 100.1 million yuan. Among them: the central budget expenditure will increase by 32 million yuan, and the local budget expenditure will increase by 69 million yuan. The itemized explanation is as follows:

	1. The central budget expenditure will increase by 32 million yuan. According to the needs of developing agricultural reclamation and agricultural production, 30 million yuan will be used to increase investment in agricultural reclamation. The remaining 2 million yuan will be used to subsidize the expenses required for the relocation and reconstruction of the Nanjing Woolen Mill.

	2. The local budget expenditure will increase by 69 million yuan. The 1957 local budget includes a year-end surplus of 137.778 million yuan. This surplus was originally intended to be used after August, depending on the situation at that time, with the approval of the State Council. Now, in view of the good execution of the national budget and the fact that some localities have requested to use a portion of the surplus funds in advance, it is recommended that half of the year-end surplus of the 1957 local budget be approved for use first, that is, 69 million yuan, to be used by the localities to solve current urgent expenditures. As for when the remaining half will be allowed to be used, it will be verified by the State Council according to the actual situation after August.

In addition, the 1957 National Budget expenditure includes an increase of 600 million yuan in bank credit funds. In order to better reflect the relationship between the national budget and bank credit, it can be considered to withdraw 180.299 million yuan from this fund to repay the overdraft from the National Bank by the Ministry of Finance in 1956. The remaining 419.701 million yuan will still be used as additional bank credit funds. This approach can not only settle the debts owed by the Ministry of Finance to the bank, but also does not affect the source of bank credit funds.

After adjusting the revenue and expenditure figures of the 1957 National Budget Draft according to the above opinions, the total revenue will increase to 29,393.934 million yuan, and the total expenditure will also increase to 29,393.934 million yuan. The budget revenue and expenditure are still balanced.

The Budget Committee recommends that the National People's Congress adopt the above opinions on adjusting the revenue and expenditure figures of the 1957 National Budget Draft and, after adjustment, approve the 1957 National Budget.

The Budget Committee also considered that in the process of executing the 1957 National Budget, it may be necessary to make some necessary adjustments to revenue and expenditure due to changes in objective circumstances. It is recommended that the State Council be authorized to adjust the relevant revenue and expenditure figures in the budget in a timely manner according to actual needs, while ensuring the balance of budget revenue and expenditure, credit revenue and expenditure, and supply and demand of materials, and report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at a certain period.

The 1957 National Budget, as Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance, said in his report, reflects the demands of the Chinese people to further develop the cause of socialist construction and reflects the strong desire of the Chinese people to build their motherland in peace. The realization of this budget will greatly help complete and overfulfill China's first five-year construction plan and lay a good foundation for welcoming the second five-year construction plan, so that China's socialist construction cause will move towards new victories. In order to fully realize the 1957 National Budget, the Budget Committee believes that it is necessary to make the following requirements to the relevant departments, all staff members, and the people of the whole country: (1) The people of the whole country must work together to improve work, increase production, and practice strict economy. The current mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy has achieved remarkable results. The leading organs at all levels should further strengthen the leadership of this movement, so that it can go deep and last long, become a regular work, and achieve greater political and economic results. (2) Agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country should strive to develop agriculture and rural sideline production, actively fight against various natural disasters, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957. (3) All industrial production departments should strive to increase production, reduce costs, improve product quality, and accelerate capital turnover on the condition that raw materials are sufficient and there is a market for sales, and strive to overfulfill the various production and financial plans stipulated by the state. (4) The commercial departments should strive to improve the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and the organization of commodity sales, actively increase the supply of commodities, continue to stabilize market prices, and strive to complete the commodity purchase and sales plans and financial plans stipulated by the state. (5) The transportation departments should strive to improve transportation conditions, increase transportation capacity, adapt to the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of commodity circulation, and strive to overfulfill the transportation plans and financial plans stipulated by the state. (6) All capital construction units should strive to save building materials and construction funds on the premise of ensuring project quality, in accordance with the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily and "spending less money and doing more things." (7) All enterprises, institutions, state organs, and people's organizations must vigorously save operating expenses and administrative management expenses, and promote the spirit of diligence, thrift, and hard work. (8) On the basis of comprehensively practicing production increase and economy, financial departments at all levels should further strengthen financial management, actively increase revenue without increasing the burden on the people, and strive to save expenditure on the principle of ensuring the needs of the country's construction cause. The Budget Committee believes that as long as all parties work hard to increase production and practice strict economy, the result of the execution of the 1957 National Budget can achieve more revenue than expenditure, thereby adding some inventory materials to the country and enriching the country's reserve strength. We should strive to achieve this goal.

Please review the above opinions at the meeting.

    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会
    关于1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案的审查报告
    （1957年7月12日预算委员会通过）
    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会主任委员　程子华
    第一届全国人民代表大会预算委员会，从今年5月下旬起，即开始审查国务院所送1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案的草稿，此次会议期间，又听取了国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念关于1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案的报告，并且根据大会代表们在讨论当中所提出的意见，对1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算草案进行了研究和审查。现在，我代表预算委员会将审查的结果报告如下：
    国务院提出的1956年国家决算，总收入为二百九十七亿五千四百四十四万四千元，总支出为三百零五亿七千四百一十三万八千元，支出大于收入八亿一千九百六十九万四千元。预算委员会详细地审查了1956年国家决算数字，同意国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在报告中对1956年国家决算所作的分析。1956年国家预算收入的完成情况一般是良好的，支出的分配和使用基本上是正确的，解决赤字的办法也大体上是适当的。1956年在国家预算执行的过程中虽然有过若干缺点，但是这些缺点同1956年所取得的巨大成绩比较起来，只居于极其次要的地位。预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会批准1956年国家决算。
    预算委员会认为，国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在报告中所总结的1956年财政工作的几点经验，对于改进今后的工作有很重要的意义。应当指出，今后财政部门应当更加注意上述经验的研究和总结，以便进一步改进和提高工作。
    预算委员会详细地审查了1957年国家预算草案，认为草案中所列各项收支数字一般是适当的，整个收支的安排是稳妥的，也是积极的。预算委员会认为，在收入和支出的某些方面，可以考虑作如下的调整：
    （一）在收入方面，工商税收增加一亿五千万元，铁道企业收入增加七千三百万元；农业税收减少五千万元，纺织工业收入减少五千七百零五万二千元，森林工业收入减少一千四百九十四万八千元。增加收入同减少收入的数额相抵，净增加收入一亿零一百万元。分项说明如下：
    1、今年1至5月份工业生产和商品流转的情况都比较好，预计今年的工商税收可以比预算草案所列的数字增加二亿元。另外，今年的棉纱产量可能完不成计划，预计要减少工商税收五千万元。以上增加和减少的数额相抵，增加税收一亿五千万元。
    2、今年1至5月份铁道部的运输计划和财务计划都完成得比较好，这与铁道企业积极推行经济核算制是分不开的。在这个基础上，进一步通过增产节约运动，有可能超额完成财务收入计划，因此，建议铁道企业收入核增七千三百万元。
    3、1957年国家预算草案所列的农业税收入，包括了1957年秋征公粮变价款在今年使用的部分。考虑到这一部分公粮变价款如果今年动用多了，就要影响明年的预算收入，而且今年1至5月份国家预算的执行情况也是比较好的，因此，建议将农业税收入中的1957年秋征公粮变价款，核减五千万元。
    4、今年国民经济计划规定棉纱产量为四百六十三点五万件，由于原棉供应不足，完成这个计划看来是有困难的。现在一方面应当责成有关部门努力克服困难，争取完成既定的生产计划；另一方面，应当按照有把握的、可能完成的产量，适当调整国家预算收入，使国家预算放在充分可靠的基础之上。除了前面已经说过，将有关棉纱的工商税收核减五千万元以外，建议将纺织工业（包括国营、地方国营和公私合营纺织企业）的利润收入，核减五千七百零五万二千元。
    5、1957年森林工业收入中，因为木材的平均销售价格计算偏高，有完不成预算草案所列数额的可能。因此，建议将森林工业收入核减一千四百九十四万八千元。
    （二）在支出方面，建议将1957年国家预算支出也核增一亿零一百万元。其中：中央预算支出增加三千二百万元，地方预算支出增加六千九百万元。分项说明如下：
    1、中央预算支出增加三千二百万元。根据开展农业垦殖、发展农业生产的需要，以三千万元用于增加农垦投资。其余二百万元，用于补助南京毛纺厂迁建所需的费用。
    2、地方预算支出增加六千九百万元。1957年地方预算中列有年终结余一亿三千七百七十八万元。这一项结余款项，原拟等到8月以后再看当时的情况，由国务院批准动用。现在鉴于国家预算执行的情况较好，有些地方又有提前动用一部分结余款项的要求，因此建议先批准将1957年地方预算年终结余动用一半，即动用六千九百万元，由地方解决当前急需的支出。至于其余一半何时允许动用，等到8月以后，由国务院根据实际情况核定。
    另外，1957年国家预算支出中列有增拨银行信贷资金六亿元，为了更好地反映国家预算同银行信贷的关系，可以考虑从这笔资金中抽出一亿八千零二十九万九千元，归还1956年财政部向国家银行透支的款项。其余四亿一千九百七十万一千元，仍然作为增拨银行信贷资金。这样处理，既可以结清财政上所欠银行的债务，又不影响银行信贷资金的来源。
    1957年国家预算草案收支数字按照上述意见调整后，总收入增加为二百九十三亿九千三百九十三万四千元，总支出也增加为二百九十三亿九千三百九十三万四千元。预算收支仍然是平衡的。
    以上关于调整1957年国家预算草案收支数字的意见，预算委员会建议全国人民代表大会加以采纳，经过调整，批准1957年国家预算。
    预算委员会还考虑到，在1957年国家预算执行的过程中，会因为客观情况的变化，需要对收入和支出作一些必要的调整。建议授权国务院在保证预算收支、信贷收支、物资供求平衡的原则下，根据实际需要，适时地调整预算中各项有关的收支数字，在一定的时期，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会报告。
    1957年国家预算，正如国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在报告中所说，它反映了我国人民进一步发展社会主义建设事业的要求，反映了我国人民和平建设祖国的强烈愿望。这个预算的实现，将大大有助于完成和超额完成我国的第一个五年建设计划，并为迎接第二个五年建设计划打下良好的基础，使我国的社会主义建设事业走向新的胜利。为了完满地实现1957年国家预算，预算委员会认为有必要向有关部门、全体工作人员和全国人民提出如下的要求：（1）全国人民必须一致努力，改进工作，增加生产，厉行节约。目前群众性的增产节约运动，已经收到了显著的成效，各级领导机关应当进一步加强对这一运动的领导，使之深入地持久下去，成为经常的工作，获得更大的政治和经济效果。（2）全国各地农业生产合作社应当努力发展农业及农村副业生产，积极同各种自然灾害作斗争，大力争取1957年农业丰收。（3）一切工业生产部门应当在原料有余又有销路的条件下，努力增加生产，降低成本，提高产品质量，加速资金周转，力争超额完成国家规定的生产、财务等各项计划。（4）商业部门应当努力改进农副业产品的收购工作和商品销售的组织工作，积极增加商品的供应，继续稳定市场物价，努力完成国家规定的商品购销计划和财务计划。（5）交通运输部门应当努力改进交通运输状况，提高运输能力，适应工农业生产发展和商品流转额扩大的需要，力争超额完成国家规定的运输计划和财务计划。（6）一切基本建设单位应当按照勤俭建国和“少花钱，多办事”的原则，在保证工程质量的前提下，努力节约建筑材料和建设资金。（7）一切企业单位、事业单位、国家机关和人民团体，都必须大力节约事业经费和行政管理费用，发扬勤俭办事、艰苦奋斗的精神。（8）在全面厉行增产节约的基础上，各级财政部门应当进一步加强财政管理工作，在不增加人民负担的前提下，积极增加收入，在保证国家建设事业需要的原则下，努力节约支出。预算委员会认为只要从各方面努力增加生产，厉行节约，1957年国家预算执行的结果，就可以作到收多于支，从而为国家增补一些库存物资，充实国家的后备力量。我们应当努力为实现这一目标而奋斗。
    以上意见，请大会审查。
