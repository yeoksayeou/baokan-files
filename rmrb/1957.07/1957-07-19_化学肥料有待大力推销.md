The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Fertilizer Department

    This newspaper reports: By the end of June, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives had transferred more than 1.01 million tons of chemical fertilizers to various provinces and cities. Coupled with the previous year's inventory in various regions, the supply is quite sufficient. However, the sales situation of chemical fertilizers in various regions is currently not good. By the end of June, supply and marketing cooperatives in seven provinces and cities, including Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, and Guizhou, had only sold 200,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, completing only 75% of the sales plan for the first half of the year, a 15% decrease compared to the same period last year.

    Chemical fertilizers should be commodities in high demand. Based on the existing commodity volume and the national average farmland, there are only slightly more than two jin per mu. It is understood that the poor sales of chemical fertilizers are mainly due to the lack of funds in agricultural cooperatives; some agricultural cooperatives have inappropriately reduced investment in chemical fertilizers due to their sole emphasis on diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives. In addition, it is also related to the lack of technical guidance.

    In order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest this year, relevant departments in various regions should organize forces to vigorously promote chemical fertilizers. When agricultural cooperatives urgently need fertilizers but lack the funds to purchase them, active efforts should be made to help solve their financial difficulties. Supply and marketing cooperatives should also improve their sales work and, at the same time, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in technical guidance on chemical fertilizers.

### 化学肥料有待大力推销

    化学肥料有待大力推销
    本报讯：6月底，供销合作总社调到各省、市的化学肥料有一百零一万多吨，加上去年各地库存，供应量是相当充足的。但是，目前各地化学肥料的销售情况很不好。北京、河北、山西、江苏、浙江、河南、贵州等七省、市供销社，到6月底，只销出化学肥料二十万吨，仅完成上半年销售计划的75％，比去年同期下降了15％。
    化学肥料应该是供不应求的商品，以现有的商品量和全国的农田平均计算，每亩只有二斤多。据了解，化学肥料销售情况不好，主要是农业社缺乏资金；有些农业社由于单纯强调勤俭办社，不适当地削减了化学肥料的投资。另外，和技术指导跟不上也有关系。
    为了争取今年的秋季丰收，各地有关部门要组织力量大力推销化学肥料。凡农业社急需化肥而无钱购买的，应积极设法协助解决资金困难。供销社也要改进销售工作，同时配合有关部门，作好化学肥料的技术指导工作。
