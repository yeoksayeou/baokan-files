    Huayuankou Flow Recedes
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th -- After a period of rapid and continuous rise, the floodwaters of the Yellow River at Huayuankou have begun to recede. At 16:00 today, the flow rate at Huayuankou had dropped to 9,000 cubic meters per second and is continuing to decrease.
    Currently, rainfall has ceased in the vast majority of the Yellow River basin, and no major flooding is expected in the coming days. However, once this flood peak reaches the area below Gaocun in Dongming, the situation along the levees below Gaocun will become quite strained.
    Yesterday, when the floodwaters were rising rapidly, three of the eleven newly constructed earth dam bases on the Mazhai levee line in Puyang County were damaged by the swift current. Over two hundred cadres and flood control team members worked through the night using willow branches and sacks to protect them.

    花园口流量回落
    新华社郑州20日电　黄河洪水在花园口一度连续猛涨后，已经回落。今天十六时花园口的流量已经降落到九千秒公方，还在继续下降着。
    目前全黄河流域绝大部分地区已经停止下雨，近几天不致再出现大水。但这次洪峰到东明高村以下后，高村以下堤线形势要相当吃紧。
    昨天当洪水猛涨时，濮阳县马寨堤线上去年新修的十一道土坝基中，有三道坝的坝头被急流冲毁，当夜被二百多名干部和防汛队员用柳枝和麻袋抢护住。
