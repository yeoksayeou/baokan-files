    The Flames of Truth Will Burn Away Demons and Monsters
    The "Thawing Society" of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy is Disintegrating
    (Our Dispatch) According to the New Hunan Daily: The reactionary group "Thawing Society," composed of rightists Li Zhenya, Huang Jichun, Huang Xinqin, Xi Shiliang, Yao Rukun, and Liu Guangzhong (all students) of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, has been crushed under the burning anger and relentless blows of the masses.
    Shortly after the Hungarian Incident last year, some of the key members of the "Thawing Society," including Xi Shiliang and Huang Jichun, convened a five-person group meeting on the hill behind the institute to draft a reactionary program. They planned to propose demands such as destroying all archive materials and compensating students who were criticized during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries for their material and mental losses. They also intended to organize a march and petition by all those in the institute who had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Xi Shiliang even plotted to harm Comrade Gu Lingshen, the Party member and vice president of the institute. These conspiracies were not realized due to disagreements among them.
    After the rectification campaign began, this small group of malicious rightists declared that they wanted to play the role of melting ice and thawing things out, and become leaders in the airing of views. Thus, the "Thawing Society" was established on May 31st. It took control of the Democracy Wall, lit fires everywhere, and spread a large number of anti-Communist and anti-socialist arguments, engaging in various reactionary activities.
      The "Democracy Wall" was filled with a bloody and poisonous atmosphere. The spearhead of attack was first directed at Party members, League members, and activists. Huang Jichun's "On Lackeys and the Nature of Slavery, and Others" slandered League members and activists as "lackeys," cursed the new society as a slave society, and called the Party "the master who gives rewards." Liu Guangzhong wrote "Do Not Be the Party's Thugs, Be the Party's Assistants," attacking Communist Youth League members and sowing discord between the Party and the masses. They even fabricated facts, claiming that a certain Party member and responsible cadre had molested women. Huang Jichun openly cursed the Party as "fascist" among backward masses. They also incited the masses to carry out a so-called "conscious" movement, wanting Party members to withdraw from the school. They especially seized on the issue of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to make trouble, inciting some students who had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to make trouble. They colluded everywhere, setting up liaison officers in every department of the institute to develop their organization, and also actively carried out activities outside the school. Their activities were directed and supported behind the scenes by rightist elements among the teachers, such as Professor Cai Chengyun. Huang Jichun openly went to the Propaganda Department of the institute's Party Committee on behalf of the "Thawing Society" to request receiving the broadcasting station and sending people to participate in the editorial work of the school newspaper. They tried their best to incite a halt to exams and graduation designs, and attempted to organize strikes. All of this was in order to coordinate with rightists in various places to create a "Hungarian Incident" in China.
    These rightists' lies once caused ideological resonance among some teachers and students who were ambiguous in their positions or did not understand the true facts. However, dark clouds can never cover the sun, and lies cannot hide the truth.
    Around June 10th, many conscious students began to refute the reactionary articles published by the "Thawing Society." At the same time, a female Communist Youth League member in the fourth grade of the Ore Dressing Department also protested the slanderous articles written by these rightists in their name, which slandered a responsible Party comrade for molesting women. Many students were very angry after reading these and posted big-character posters protesting and refuting the "Thawing Society." Seeing that the situation was not good, several reactionary leaders of the "Thawing Society" immediately changed their tactics, issuing a public statement saying that "the 'Thawing Society' publishes everything submitted, and is responsible for its own writing," calling on everyone to fire at the "three evils" and not point the finger at "our own people." They put up big-character posters, saying that the "Thawing Society" was going to conduct internal rectification; Huang Jichun and Huang Xinqin even ran to the Party Committee to announce their "withdrawal from the society," preparing to go underground. After these stupid and despicable attempts were exposed, their tricks became more and more numerous: some wrote false self-criticisms; some pretended to be sick and ran elsewhere to "see a doctor." Some pretended to be crazy and acted like fools, making all kinds of ugly scenes.
    At the three evenings of the all-institute denunciation meeting from July 7th to 9th, everyone further exposed and refuted the "Thawing Society," further isolating its core members. Now, a small number of the society's core members have begun to confess some of the facts of their activities.
    Who are these rightists who actively created the "Hungarian Incident"? Some of them came from landlord families, and some came from bourgeois families; they had all been strongly influenced by the reactionary and exploiting classes, and hated the Party and the new society. Among them, Huang Xinqin's father was suppressed by our army during the Great Revolution. Huang Xinqin had always been educated by his brother, Huang Zhizhai (a Kuomintang backbone), with the idea of "father's revenge must be avenged," and buried the seeds of revenge deep in his heart. Li Zhenya's father was a high-ranking officer in the Kuomintang army. Li Zhenya once boasted to his classmates about his childhood life, saying: "Think about it, when I was young, I rode in cars and lived in mansions, how wonderful..." He seemed to feel a great sense of the difference between the past and the present.

### 真理的烈火要烧毁牛鬼蛇神  中南矿冶学院“解冻社”在瓦解

    真理的烈火要烧毁牛鬼蛇神
    中南矿冶学院“解冻社”在瓦解
    本报讯　据新湖南报报道：中南矿冶学院的右派分子李镇亚、黄际春、黄心钦、奚士良、姚如琨、刘光中（均为学生）等组成的反动集团解冻社，在群众怒火的燃烧和无情的痛击下，被摧毁了。
    去年匈牙利事件发生后不久，解冻社部分首脑奚士良、黄际春等就在学院后山上召开五人小组会议，草拟反动纲领，准备提出毁掉全部档案材料、赔偿肃反被斗同学物质和精神损失等要求，还打算组织全院肃反被斗的人游行请愿，奚士良则拟谋害党员副院长顾凌申同志。这些阴谋因他们中意见分歧，没有实现。
    整风开始后，这一小撮居心叵测的右派分子，声言要起融冰解冻的作用，要成为鸣放中的领导者，于是解冻社在5月31日成立了。它把持了民主墙，到处点火，大量散布反共反社会主义的论调，进行种种反动活动。
      “民主墙”上弥漫着腥风毒气。进攻的矛头首先是指向党团员和积极分子，黄际春写的“论奴才与奴隶性及其它”，污蔑团员和积极分子是“奴才”，咒骂新社会为奴隶社会，党是“看赏的主人”。刘光中写了“不做党的打手，要做党的助手”，攻击共青团员，挑拨党群关系。他们甚至还捏造事实，凭空说某党员负责干部调戏妇女。黄际春公然在落后群众中骂党是“法西斯”。他们还煽动群众开展所谓“自觉”运动，要党员退出学校。他们特别抓住肃反问题做文章，煽动某些肃反中被斗争的同学起来闹事。他们到处串连，在全院各系都设有联络员，发展组织，还在校外积极进行活动。他们的活动，得到教师中右派分子如教授蔡承云等的幕后指挥和支持。黄际春公然代表解冻社到院党委宣传部，要求接收广播台和派人参加校刊编辑工作。他们竭力煽动停考、停止毕业设计，并企图组织罢课。这一切都是为了和各地右派分子配合，制造中国的“匈牙利事件”。
    这些右派分子的谎言，也曾在一些立场模糊或者不明事实真象的教师和学生中引起思想共鸣。然而，乌云终于遮不住太阳，谎言也掩盖不了事实。
    在6月10日左右，不少有觉悟的学生对解冻社发表的反动文章开展驳斥。同时，选矿系四年级女共青团员也抗议这些右派分子假冒她们的名义写出的污蔑一党员负责同志调戏妇女的文章。不少学生看了这些以后都非常愤恨，纷纷发表抗议和驳斥解冻社的大字报。解冻社几个反动首脑看见风势不好，就马上改变策略，发表公开声明，说什么“解冻社是来文照登，文责自负”，号召大家要对准“三害”开火，不要把矛头指向“自己人”。他们贴出大字报，说什么解冻社要进行内部整顿；黄际春、黄心钦还跑到党委会宣布“退社”，准备转入秘密活动。这些愚蠢而又卑鄙的企图被揭穿后，他们的花招越来越多：有人写假检讨；有人装病跑到别处去“看病”。有人装疯卖傻，丑态百出。
    在7月7日至9日三个晚上的全院声讨大会上，大家进一步揭发、驳斥了解冻社，使它的骨干分子更加陷于孤立。现在，该社已有少数骨干分子开始交代了自己的部分活动事实。
    这些积极制造“匈牙利事件”的右派分子都是些什么人物呢？他们有的出身于地主家庭，出身于资产阶级家庭；他们都曾受到反动、剥削阶级的强烈影响，仇恨着党和新社会。其中，黄心钦的父亲在大革命时期被我军镇压，黄心钦一贯受他哥哥黄直斋（国民党骨干）的“父仇必报”的教育，心灵深处埋藏着复仇的种子。李镇亚的父亲是国民党军队高级军官，李镇亚曾向同学夸耀他的少年时代生活，说：“想老子当年坐小汽车，住公馆，多么……”颇有不胜今昔之感。
