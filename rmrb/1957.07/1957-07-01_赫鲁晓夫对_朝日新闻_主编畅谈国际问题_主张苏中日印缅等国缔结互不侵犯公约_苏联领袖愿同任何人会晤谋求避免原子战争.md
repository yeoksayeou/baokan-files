Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th: The conversation between Khrushchev and the editor-in-chief of the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," Tomoo Hirooka, on June 18th in Moscow has been published here.

Khrushchev, in answering the question posed by the Japanese journalist regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards convening a summit conference of the great powers, said, "We are willing to meet in any location, with anyone, as long as such a meeting helps to resolve the issues of concern to the people of all countries – avoiding atomic war and hydrogen weapon war."

Regarding the issue of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union responded to Japan's appeal and proposed the immediate cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. Despite the refusal of Western countries, we still advocate stopping nuclear weapons testing. We suggest that Western countries suspend atomic weapons testing for two or three years, striving to reach a temporary agreement, and hope that the temporary agreement can become permanent. But some people do not support us. The United States and Britain have incessantly put forward new conditions and reservations.
	If the Soviet Union unilaterally stops testing
	nuclear weapons, it will encourage imperialist
	adventurism.

The Japanese journalist believes that the Soviet Union should stop testing unilaterally, but Khrushchev believes that this is unreasonable. He pointed out that if the Soviet Union alone stops testing nuclear weapons, and other countries possessing nuclear weapons do not respond and continue to test, the Soviet Union will fall behind. As a result, the Soviet Union would have to resume testing. At that time, the arms race will intensify, and its scale will become larger and larger. It can be seen that a separate statement by the Soviet Union will not have good results; on the contrary, it will only be an encouragement to aggressors.

Khrushchev said that last year we unilaterally reduced our armed forces by 1.8 million people. But our Western opponents have not been able to agree to follow suit.

Khrushchev added: If we stop testing, we will weaken our national defense to some extent. And it is precisely by relying on this strength that we contain the forces of war and strengthen the forces of peace. If our strength is weakened to some extent, wouldn't this encourage the imperialist forces to engage in adventurous activities?
	If the Soviet Union and Japan can sign a
	document to stop testing nuclear weapons,
	China, India, and other countries will support it.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union and Japan could sign a joint document on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing that other countries would also support. Khrushchev expressed his firm belief that India would agree to this document, and the People's Republic of China and all other socialist countries, as well as all former dependent countries, would unconditionally support it. Khrushchev said that in this way, it would be like establishing a united front of all countries fighting to stop nuclear weapons testing, stop the arms race, and strive for peaceful coexistence. Khrushchev expressed his belief that this movement in all countries will lead to the achievement of its stated goals.

The Japanese journalist asked Khrushchev: It seems that the United States believes that as long as there are powerful armed forces equipped with nuclear weapons, it can prevent war and defend peace. What is the Soviet Union's view on this issue?

Khrushchev said, we do not agree with this view. This is the view of warmongers, not peacemakers.

In answering questions about Soviet-Japanese relations, Khrushchev said: We hope that our neighbor, Japan, is a Japan that is friendly to us. This is good for both countries. Since it is good, why doesn't Japan do it? Japan doesn't do this because it relies on the United States. I think Japan will not endure this status for long. We hope that Japan will soon regain its true sovereignty.
	After the peace treaty with Japan is signed, the
	Soviet Union will immediately transfer the Habomai
	Islands and Shikotan Island.

Khrushchev hopes that Japan will sign a peace treaty with the Soviet Union and establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China. He said that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Japan, as well as India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries, would do well to conclude a non-aggression pact. He said, "I am not prepared to put forward any specific proposals now. Some consideration must be given. I hope Japan will take some steps, and we will specifically propose what steps should be taken."

In answering questions about the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island, Khrushchev said: Once the peace treaty with Japan is concluded, the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island will be immediately transferred to Japan. Khrushchev said that if we hand over the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to you before the conclusion of the peace treaty, it would be tantamount to helping those foreign forces that are obstructing the conclusion of the peace treaty. Khrushchev said, if the United States returns Okinawa to you tomorrow, then I will suggest that the government return the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island to Japan before the conclusion of the peace treaty.

In answering questions about the Hungarian incident, Khrushchev said: "The people's democratic system has been consolidated, and incidents like those in the past will not happen there again. These incidents will not happen in other socialist countries either, because the Hungarian incident has taught all countries a lesson, and the people of socialist countries will not allow the enemy to have the opportunity to launch such incidents again. The main thing is to pay attention to listening to the opinions of the people and not to make mistakes that would undermine the mutual relationship between the leaders and the people.

Whether to change the wording regarding the prevention of Japanese aggression in the Soviet-Chinese treaty depends mainly on Japan.

The reporter asked Khrushchev whether it was possible to change the provision in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance regarding joint measures in the event of renewed Japanese aggression. Khrushchev replied that the Soviet Union was willing to discuss this issue. However, whether conditions can be created to change the wording in the Sino-Soviet treaty depends mainly on Japan. Japan should show goodwill, first of all by recognizing the People's China. Khrushchev said, "You recognize the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and develop trade relations with them, then the situation will change, and the wording in the treaty can also be changed. I am only speaking from our side, and I do not mean to express any opinions on behalf of the People's Republic of China. But I think our Chinese friends will agree with this."

The Soviet Union is not afraid to withdraw its troops stationed in foreign countries, but the United States, Britain, and France are afraid to do so.

Khrushchev said that in order to ease international relations, the Soviet Union has suggested that Western countries withdraw their troops from Germany and other European countries and abolish their military bases. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also prepared to withdraw its troops stationed in Germany, Romania, Poland, and Hungary under the Warsaw Treaty. We suggest withdrawing troops to see how the situation is in socialist countries, West Germany, and other countries after the withdrawal of foreign troops. However, the United States, Britain, and France refused to do so.

Khrushchev continued, "We firmly believe that the socialist system is in line with the wishes of the people, and the regime in socialist countries has a solid foundation. We are not afraid to withdraw our troops from all host countries, but Britain, France, and the United States are afraid to do so. The governments of Italy and West Germany are also afraid of foreign troops withdrawing from their countries. This means that they do not believe in themselves, and they do not believe that the people are committed to the capitalist system."

Khrushchev emphasized that in Britain, France, and the United States, many people are already talking about the need to end the stationing of foreign troops in other countries. People are talking about this more and more. This great tide has been set in motion, and no one can stop it.

    赫鲁晓夫对“朝日新闻”主编畅谈国际问题
    主张苏中日印缅等国缔结互不侵犯公约
    苏联领袖愿同任何人会晤谋求避免原子战争
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：此间公布了赫鲁晓夫同日本“朝日新闻”主编广冈知男6月18日在莫斯科的谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答这位日本新闻工作者所提出的苏联对召开大国政府首脑会议的态度如何的问题时说，“我们愿意在任何地点、同任何人会晤，只要这种会议有助于解决各国人民所关心的问题——避免原子战争和氢武器战争。”
    关于试验原子武器和氢武器问题，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联响应日本的呼吁，并且建议立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器。尽管西方国家拒绝，我们仍旧主张停
  止核武器试验。我们建议西方国家暂停原子武器试验两三年，即争取达成一项临时协定，并且希望临时协定能变成永久性的。但是有人不支持我们。美国和英国不休止地一再提出新的条件和保留。
        苏联如果单独停止试验核武
    器，将促使帝国主义进行冒险活
    动。
    日本记者认为苏联应当单独停止试验，赫鲁晓夫认为这是说不过去的。他指出，如果苏联单独停止试验核武器，而其他拥有核武器的国家不响应并且仍然继续试验的话，苏联就会落后。结果，苏联将不得不重新恢复试验。那时，军备竞赛就会加剧，而其规模会越来越大。由此可见，苏联单独声明不会有好的结果，相反地，只会是对侵略者的一种鼓励。
    赫鲁晓夫说，去年我们单独裁减了自己的武装力量一百八十万人。但是我们的西方对手并没有能同意跟着这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫又说：如果我们停止试验，就将会在某种程度上削弱我们的国防力量。而我们恰恰就是凭借这种力量遏止战争势力和加强和平力量的。如果我们力量有若干削弱，不正就促使帝国主义势力去进行冒险活动么？
        苏日如能签订停止试验核武
    器文件，中印等国都会支持。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联和日本有可能就停止试验核武器问题签订一个其他国家也会支持的共同文件。赫鲁晓夫表示深信，印度会赞同这种文件，中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家以及所有过去的附属国都会无条件地支持它。赫鲁晓夫说，这样，就如同建立成一条为停止试验核武器、停止军备竞赛，为争取和平共处而斗争的各国统一战线。赫鲁晓夫表示相信，各国的这种运动将导致达到既定目的。
    日本记者问赫鲁晓夫：看来，美国认为，只要有装备核武器的强大武装力量存在，就能防止战争，保卫和平。在这个问题上，苏联的观点是怎样的？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们不赞同这种观点，这是好战分子的观点，而不是和平人士的观点。
  赫鲁晓夫在回答有关苏日关系问题时说：我们希望我们的邻国日本是一个对我们友好的日本。这对两国都是有好处的。既然有好处，日本何乐而不为呢？日本之所以不这样做是因为它依赖美国。我想，日本对这种地位是不会长久忍受的。我们希望日本很快地收回真正的主权。
        对日和约签订后，苏联就立即移交齿舞群岛和色丹岛。
    赫鲁晓夫希望日本跟苏联签订和约，同中华人民共和国建立正常的关系。他说，苏联、中华人民共和国、日本以及印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国最好能缔结一项互不侵犯公约。他说，“我现在不准备提出什么具体的建议。必须作一番考虑。希望日本作出某些步骤，而我们也将具体地提出应采取何种步骤。”
    在回答有关齿舞群岛和色丹岛问题时，赫鲁晓夫说：一旦对日和约缔结后，就立即将齿舞群岛和色丹岛移交给日本。赫鲁晓夫说，如果我们在缔结和约以前就把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交给你们，那就等于助长了那些阻挠缔结和约的外力。赫鲁晓夫说，如果美国明天就把冲绳岛交还给你们，那末我就建议政府在缔结和约以前把齿舞群岛和色丹岛交还给日本。
    在回答关于匈牙利事件问题时，赫鲁晓夫说：“人民民主制度已经巩固了，在那里再也不会发生像过去那样的事件了。这些事件在其他社会主义国家里也不会发生了，因为匈牙利事件使各国得到了教益，社会主义各国的人民不允许敌人得到再发动这类事件的机会。主要的是要注意倾听人民的意见，不犯会破坏领导者和人民之间的相互关系的错误。
    是否改变苏中条约中有关防止日本侵略的措辞，主要取决于日本。
    记者问赫鲁晓夫，是否可以改变苏中友好同盟互助条约中所载的一旦日本侵略再起便采取联合措施的规定。赫鲁晓夫回答说，苏联愿意讨论这个问题。但是，是否能创造条件改变苏中条约中的措辞，这主要是取决于日本。日本应该表现出善意，首先是承认人民中国。赫鲁晓夫说，“你们承认中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国吧，同它们发展贸易关系吧，那时情况会起变化，条约中的措辞也就可以改变了。我这只是从我们这方面来说，我没有意思代表中华人民共和国发表意见。不过我想，我们的中国朋友也会同意这点的。”
    苏联不怕撤回驻外国军队，美英法三国却害怕这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫说，为了缓和国际关系，苏联已经建议西方国家从德国和欧洲其他国家撤军，取消自己的军事基地。同时，苏联也准备撤退根据华沙条约驻扎在德国、罗马尼亚、波兰和匈牙利的军队。我们建议撤军，看看社会主义国家、西德以及其他国家在外国军队撤出后的局势怎样。可是，美国、英国和法国拒绝这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我们坚信，社会主义制度是符合人民的愿望的，社会主义国家的政权是有巩固基础的。我们不害怕把自己的军队从所有驻在国撤回来，但是，英国、法国和美国是害怕这点的。意大利和西德政府也害怕外国军队从它们的国家撤走。这就意味着，它们不相信自己，不相信人民对资本主义制度的信奉。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，在英国、法国和美国已经有许多人在谈论说，应该结束外国军队驻扎在别国的情况。人们对这件事的谈论越来越多。这个巨潮已经掀起，谁也不能制止它。
