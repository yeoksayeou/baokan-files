Using Yellow River Water for Irrigation
Dayuzhang Wheat Yields Increase by One to Two Times

    (Our report) Jinan - More than 50,000 mu of wheat in the Dayuzhang Yellow River irrigation area, located in Shandong Province in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, have achieved their first bumper harvest in history after being irrigated with Yellow River water. According to the person in charge of the Yellow River Irrigation Administration, the wheat yield this year after irrigation with Yellow River water increased by 80% to more than double compared to a normal bumper year, and about twice as much as the wheat that was not irrigated this year. It is estimated that a total of 5.5 million jin of wheat can be increased. These days, the state-owned Guangbei and Wuyi farms and thirty-six agricultural cooperatives in the Dayuzhang irrigation area are rushing to harvest and thresh the wheat. Every day from dawn, the roads leading to various villages in the irrigation area are filled with horse-drawn carts loaded with wheat. (Song Jie)

    引用黄水灌溉
    打渔张小麦增产一至二倍
    本报讯　位于黄河下游山东省境内的打渔张引黄灌区的五万多亩小麦，经过引黄水灌溉以后，获得历史上第一次大丰收。据引黄灌溉管理局负责人说，今年经过引黄河水灌溉的小麦产量，比一般丰收年增产80％到一倍以上，比今年没有浇水的小麦增产两倍左右。预计共可增产小麦五百五十万斤。这几天，打渔张灌区的国营广北、五一两个农场和三十六个农业社正突击进行小麦的收割和轧场。每天从黎明起，灌区通往各村的大道上，满载小麦的马车络绎不绝。　（宋杰）
