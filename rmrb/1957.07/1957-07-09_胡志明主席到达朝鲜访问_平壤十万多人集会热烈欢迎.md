Diplomatic envoys from various fraternal countries to China were also present at the airport to see him off.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Ung-gi, and Counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Bong-xi, accompanied Chairman Ho Chi Minh to Pyongyang on the same plane. They had specially traveled from Korea to welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam arrived in Pyongyang by plane at 2:00 PM today and was warmly welcomed by more than 200,000 people.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh is visiting Korea at the invitation of Chairman Kim Tu-bong of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Today, Pyongyang was refreshed after the rain, the sky was clear, and the newly built high-rise buildings were particularly beautiful, shaded by green trees and national flags. The whole city of Pyongyang was decorated with the national flags of Korea and Vietnam. Workers, students, staff, and citizens dressed in festive attire gathered on the streets and along the roads to welcome the distinguished guest.

After disembarking from the plane, Chairman Ho Chi Minh warmly embraced Chairman Kim Tu-bong and Premier Kim Il-sung, who had come to welcome him. Accompanied by Kim Tu-bong and Kim Il-sung, he reviewed the guard of honor. Then, in an open-top car, he proceeded from the airport to Kim Il-sung Square amidst the cheers of the welcoming crowd waving flowers and flags, where a mass welcome rally was held.

Accompanying Chairman Ho Chi Minh on his visit to Korea today were Minister of Culture of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Hoang Minh Giam, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party Hoang Van Hoan, and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam Pham Ngoc Thach.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 8th: A mass rally attended by more than 100,000 people was held in Pyongyang this afternoon to welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit to Korea.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh, accompanied by Chairman Kim Tu-bong and Premier Kim Il-sung, ascended the podium amidst thunderous cheers and applause from the crowd.

Kim Il-sung spoke first, extending a warm welcome to Chairman Ho Chi Minh on behalf of the Korean people. He said that the people of Korea and Vietnam have forged friendly relations in the common struggle against colonialists and are strongly united today on the common front to strive for the unification and independence of their homelands.

After recounting the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the struggle against foreign aggressors, Kim Il-sung said that the victory of the Vietnamese people once again proves that no matter how frantic the imperialists may be, they cannot subdue the people who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their homeland. He said that the victory of the great Chinese people's revolution, the consolidation and development of the People's Republic of China, the failure of the imperialists' aggression against the people of Korea and Vietnam, and the upsurge of the national liberation struggles of the people of other Asian countries have confirmed that the imperialist colonial system in Asia has almost completely collapsed, and a new era has arrived in which the Asian people are the masters of Asia.

Kim Il-sung condemned the US imperialists for undermining the Geneva Accords, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and plotting to drag South Vietnam into the Manila Treaty Organization. He also once again denounced the US imperialists' illegal act of unilaterally abandoning the provisions of Article 13D of the Korean Armistice Agreement and bringing new types of weapons into South Korea to aggravate the tension in the Korean region.

In his speech, Kim Il-sung expressed his determination to continue the resolute struggle for a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue and the Korean issue. On the Korean issue, he reiterated that the Korean Armistice Agreement must be strictly observed, and that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves, and once again proposed the immediate convening of an international conference attended by relevant countries to resolve the Korean issue.

Kim Il-sung concluded by saying that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit to Korea will greatly help to further consolidate and develop the brotherly friendship and solidarity that has already been forged between the people of Korea and Vietnam, and will further strengthen the friendship and solidarity among socialist countries.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then spoke at the rally, saying that the Vietnamese people have always loved the Korean people and are honored to have the people of a brotherly country like the heroic Korean people. The Vietnamese people regard the victories achieved by the Korean people in the struggle against imperialism as their own victories.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh condemned the illegal actions of the US imperialists in undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Accords. He said that the Vietnamese people support the policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the country. The cause of unifying our homelands in Vietnam and Korea is arduous and complex, but we believe that the people of Vietnam and Korea will surely achieve victory.

Ho Chi Minh concluded by saying that his visit to Korea marks the ever-growing consolidation and development of the friendship and solidarity between the people of Vietnam and Korea in the big family of the socialist camp. Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, wished the Korean people greater achievements in the cause of peaceful reunification of the country and socialist construction.
