	"Three Societies" Combined
	— The Benefits of Merging Agricultural Cooperatives, Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Credit Cooperatives
	Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Kuihua, Huang Bipei

Editor's Note: The experiment in some townships in Nan'an County, Fujian, to merge agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives into a single organization is a new approach. According to this article, this approach has initially coordinated some of the contradictions in agricultural production, commerce, and finance work in the past. This is a good aspect. As for the specific problems that have arisen or may arise after the "Three Societies" are combined? How to solve them? This article talks very little about this.
The "Three Societies Combined" approach is worthy of attention and study. We hope that comrades working in rural areas will express their opinions on this.

The experiment in Lian Tang, Qi Feng, Gui Feng, Zhen Shan and other townships in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, to merge agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives into a single organization has initially shown a positive effect on solving the current incoordination between rural commerce, finance, and agricultural production.

Each of these townships has an agricultural cooperative, a supply and marketing cooperative, and a credit cooperative. Agricultural cooperatives are led by the basic-level Party and government organizations in the villages and townships. Supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives are led by the higher-level supply and marketing cooperatives and the People's Bank. The basic-level rural Party and government organizations cannot organize the credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to serve agricultural production well. After Lian Tang Township established an advanced agricultural cooperative last year, a large amount of production funds were needed, but at that time, the deposits of the credit cooperative were borrowed by the members. Some members did not need the money, but they borrowed money because they saw others borrowing money, fearing that they would suffer losses. The agricultural cooperative had to borrow back a large number of agricultural loans from the bank. The supply and marketing cooperative carried out supply and marketing business according to the requirements of the higher-level cooperative, often failing to meet local needs. Some cadres and people said: Now that agricultural cooperation has been realized, the credit cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative are still "going it alone." In addition, the three cooperatives each have their own set of organizations, meeting systems, and leading cadres. The cadres have opinions on this, and the masses are also dissatisfied.

At the beginning of this year, the Jinjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China working group conducted an experiment of "Three Societies" combined in Lian Tang Township, merging the agricultural cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative, and the credit cooperative into a single organization, but retaining the three institutions. The supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative still use their original names and retain a certain degree of independence. In addition to the vertical leadership of the grassroots supply and marketing and credit cooperatives by the system, they form a unified cooperative affairs committee and a members' representative assembly with the agricultural cooperative. Representatives of the agricultural cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative, and the credit cooperative are re-elected in the same electoral district at the same time. Members of the three cooperatives raise their hands three times separately and can elect one person to serve as the representative of the three types of cooperatives. As a result of the election, the members' representatives of the agricultural cooperative are also the representatives of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative; the management committee members of the agricultural cooperative are also the directors of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative; and the supervisory committee members of the agricultural cooperative are also the supervisors of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative. The head (or director) of the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative is mostly concurrently held by the head or deputy head of the agricultural cooperative. This reduces rural institutions and meetings. One members' representative assembly can solve the problems of the three cooperatives at the same time. One cooperative affairs committee can also study the problems of the three aspects at the same time. After mutual communication, the supply and marketing cooperative can grasp the needs of the entire township for means of production and means of livelihood at any time, and purchase them from higher-level cooperatives or from other places as soon as possible, so that the county and district supply and marketing cooperatives can carry out supply and marketing business in a planned way. During the busy spring production season this year, the "Three Societies" Cooperative Affairs Committee organized supply and marketing cooperative cadres to carry goods for mobile supply, set up more sales stalls, and facilitated the masses to purchase goods. Members can deposit and withdraw money from the credit cooperative at any time. The credit cooperative can also understand the capital situation of the entire township and the entire cooperative at any time. According to the production needs of the entire township, it can mobilize members to deposit money and raise funds for the agricultural cooperative. This spring, the Lian Tang Township Credit Cooperative mobilized members to deposit more than 10,000 yuan in a very short period of time through this credit group, more than doubling the amount of deposits before the combination of the three cooperatives, and most of it was used for agricultural production. The agricultural cooperative decided to develop fruit production on the nearby mountains and raise fish in the ponds. The credit cooperative promptly raised more than 2,000 yuan to help the agricultural cooperative purchase various saplings such as bananas, oranges, peaches, and plums, and purchase a large number of fish fry. This has changed the incoordination between the agricultural cooperative mobilizing members to invest production funds in the cooperative and the credit cooperative mobilizing members to deposit money in the credit cooperative in the past.

After the three societies are combined, in addition to facilitating members to buy things and deposit and borrow money, it can save members a lot of work delays. According to preliminary calculations, in Lian Tang Township, with 2,428 households, members can save more than 21,000 workdays in a year by going to the market. At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperative itself can also save expenses. In addition, it is also convenient for the masses to supervise all aspects of the work. In the local off-season of April and May, the turnover of supply and marketing departments in the vicinity has decreased by about 5%, while the turnover of the four cooperatives in Lian Tang has increased by 22% in the past two months compared with before the combination, mainly because they are thinking about the members in all aspects and facilitating the members.

Now, some cadres of the county and district supply and marketing cooperatives and the People's Bank have concerns that it is not convenient to lead, transfer, and train grassroots cadres who are under the management of the township. After the three societies are combined, how should the higher-level cooperatives and the lower-level cooperatives connect, how should the higher-level cooperatives arrange work and lead according to the new organizational form, how should the higher-level cooperatives and the People's Bank closely cooperate with the basic-level Party and government organizations in the villages and townships, etc., relevant departments will continue to experiment with.

    “三社”合一
    ——农业社、供销社和信用社合而为一的好处
    新华社记者　刘葵华　黄碧沛
    编者按：福建南安县部分乡把农业社、供销社和信用社合为单一组织的试验，是一种新的作法。据这篇文章说，这种做法已经初步协调了过去农业生产、商业和金融工作中的一些矛盾。这是好的一方面。至于“三社”合一以后产生了或可能产生那些具体问题？如何解决？在这篇文章中谈得很少。
    “三社合一”的做法是值得注意和加以研究的，希望在农村工作的同志对此发表意见。
    福建省南安县莲塘、崎峰、贵峰和镇山等乡试验把农业社、供销社、信用社合为单一的组织，已初步显示出对解决当前农村商业、金融、农业生产间不协调现象有着积极作用。
    这些乡每乡都有一个农业社、供销社和信用社。农业社是乡村党、政基层组织领导，供销社和信用社是上级供销社和人民银行领导，农村党、政基层组织无法组织信用社和供销社很好地为农业生产服务。去年莲塘乡建立高级农业社后，需要大量生产资金，而当时信用社的存款被社员们借去，有些社员并不需要用钱，只是看到别人借钱，自己怕吃亏也借了钱，农业社不得不向银行借回大批农业贷款。供销社按照上级社的要求进行供销业务，往往不能符合当地需求。一些干部和群众说：现在农业合作化了，信用社和供销社还是“单干”。另外，三个社各有一套组织、会议制度和领导干部，干部对此有意见，群众也不满意。
    今年年初中共晋江地委工作组在莲塘乡进行“三社”合一的试验，把农业社、供销社和信用社合并为单一组织，但仍留着三个机构。供销社同信用社仍沿用原来名称，保留一定的独立性。基层供销、信用两社仍有系统的垂直领导外，同农业社组成统一的社务委员会和社员代表大会。农业社、供销社和信用社的代表在一个选区同时进行改选，三个社的社员分别举三次手，可以选一个人担任三种社的代表。选举结果，农业社社员代表同时是供销社和信用社的代表；农业社管理委员同时是供销社和信用社的理事；农业社监察委员同时是供销社和信用社的监事。供销社和信用社的社长
  （或主任）大都是由农业社社长或副社长兼任。减少了农村机构和会议，一次社员代表大会，可以同时解决三个社的问题。一次社务委员会，也可以同时研究三方面的问题。相互通气后，供销社可以随时掌握全乡对生产资料和生活资料的需要情况，及早向上级社或向外地采购，使县、区供销社有计划地开展供销业务。今年春季生产大忙期间，“三社”社务委员会组织供销社干部担货流动供应，增设售货摊，便利了群众购货。社员们可以随时向信用社存款、取款。信用社也可以随时了解全乡全社的资金情况，可以根据全乡生产需要，发动社员存款，替农业社筹集资金。今年春季莲塘乡信用社通过这种信用小组，在很短时间内就发动社员存款一万多元，比三社合一前的存款额，增加了二倍多，绝大部分用到了农业生产上。农业社决定在附近山上发展水果生产和在池塘中养鱼，信用社又及时筹集了二千多元资金，帮助农业社购买香蕉、柑桔、桃李等各种树苗和购买大批鱼苗。改变了过去农业社发动社员向社里投资生产资金，信用社发动社员向信用社存款的不协调现象。
    三社合一后，除了便利社员购买东西，存借款外，可以节省社员大量误工。据初步计算，莲塘乡二千四百二十八户中，在一年中就可以节省社员上市误工二万一千多工。同时供销社本身也可以节省开支。另外，也便于群众对各方面的工作进行监督。在当地4、5月份是淡季，今年附近供销部门营业额都下降5％左右，而莲塘四个社两个月来的营业额却比合一前上升了22％，主要是从各方面为社员着想，便利社员的结果。
    现在，县、区供销社和人民银行部分干部，有怕基层干部属乡里管理，不好领导，调动和培养不方便的顾虑。三社合一后，上级社和下级社究竟如何衔接，上级社怎样根据新的组织形式布置工作和进行领导，上级社、人民银行怎样和乡村党、政基层组织密切配合工作等，有关部门将在继续试验中。
