　　Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: Cairo Dispatch: The Omani Office in Cairo announced on the 23rd that Omani insurgents have occupied the town of Buraimi. Buraimi is four miles west of Nizwa, the ancient capital of Oman.

　　According to Harsai, the representative of the Omani Imam in Cairo, the office received this news on the evening of the 23rd. The news also stated that the insurgents have surrounded the British military headquarters in Jebel Faihud. Jebel Faihud is also west of Nizwa.

　　Harsai denied that the insurgents had received assistance from outside.

　　London Dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons on July 23rd that the British Air Force had distributed leaflets to the rebellious tribes in Oman and had begun bombing some of the strongholds they occupied.

　　He also said that the British military authorities there have been allowed to decide for themselves "to take any necessary action" to fully support the Sultan of Muscat.

　　Lloyd reaffirmed that the weapons of the Omani insurgent tribal forces were transported from outside. However, he stated that he could not yet assert which country was responsible for this.

　　He said that Britain and the United States have been in contact on the Oman issue. It is reported that Lloyd discussed the situation in Oman with U.S. Ambassador Whitney that morning. On the same day, British Ambassador to the United States, Caccia, also paid a special visit to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles regarding this matter.

　　Labor MP Bevan believed that if weapons were transported from Saudi Arabia, the United States should be asked to persuade Saudi Arabia not to use violence on this issue. Lloyd replied that it would be useless to level accusations against certain countries at this time.

　　According to an AFP dispatch from London, the British government has formulated a three-stage plan to suppress the Omani uprising. Well-informed sources revealed that, according to this plan, the British Air Force, mainly based in Aden, will circle low and drop warning leaflets over areas occupied by the insurgents to intimidate them. If this fails, British aircraft will strafe the rebel forces. If this also does not yield decisive results, the British government will use ground forces, and the ground forces used will be more than just two or three companies of the "Cameron Highlanders" as reported, but several battalions.

　　Britain is currently intensifying its troop deployments. The British military headquarters on the island of Cyprus has announced that it will airlift a battalion of troops from Kenya to Oman to suppress the uprising. On the 23rd, two transport planes transported one hundred soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the English Infantry Regiment stationed in Kenya and their equipment. It is believed that their destination is the British military base in Sharjah in the Persian Gulf.

　　Washington Dispatch: U.S. State Department spokesman White on the 23rd tried his best to conceal the factors in the Oman incident that involve the struggle between the United States and Britain for oil interests in the region.

　　British newspapers have accused American oil groups of being enemies of British interests in the region and that the United States is supplying weapons to the Omani insurgents.

　　Under a series of questions from reporters, White said that these reports in the British newspapers "are clumsy fabrications."

　　White said that the State Department "has no evidence" that any American weapons have been transported to the Oman region.

　　He said that the United States sells weapons to Saudi Arabia and helps train its army.

　　White said that Britain often informs the United States of the situation in Oman, and the United States currently "has not expressed a willingness to mediate in this dispute."

    阿曼起义者包围英军司令部  英国加紧调兵遣将准备镇压
    怀特竭力掩饰美英在阿曼争夺石油资源
    本报综合报道　据新华社24日讯：开罗消息：阿曼驻开罗办事处23日宣布，阿曼起义者已经占领了布拉镇。布拉在阿曼古都尼兹瓦以西四英里。
    据阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛说，这个消息是办事处在23日晚间收到的。消息还说，起义者包围了费胡德山的英军司令部。费胡德山也在尼兹瓦以西。
    哈尔赛否认起义者从外界取得帮助。
    伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德7月23日在下院宣布，英国空军已经向阿曼起义部落散发了传单，并且开始轰炸他们所占领的一些据点。
    他还说，已经让那里的英国军事当局自行决定“采取任何必要行动”来全力支持马斯喀特的苏丹。
    劳埃德再次肯定，阿曼起义部落军队的武器是从外地运进去的。但是他表示还不能断言这件事是哪一个国家干的。
    他说，在阿曼问题上英国和美国保持着接触。有消息说，当天上午，劳埃德同美国大使惠特尼商谈过阿曼形势。同一天，英国驻美国大使卡西亚也为这件事特地访问了美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    工党议员比万认为，如果武器是从沙特阿拉伯运进去的，就应当要美国来劝说沙特阿拉伯在这个问题上不使用暴力。劳埃德回答说，在目前对某些国家提出指责没有什么用处。
    据法新社伦敦消息说，英国政府已经制订了一个三阶段计划来镇压阿曼的起义。消息灵通人士透露，根据这个计划，主要以亚丁为基地的英国空军将在起义者占领的地区盘旋低飞和投下警告性的传单来恫吓起义者。如果这样做失败的话，英国飞机就将扫射起义部队。如果这也得不到决定性结果，英国政府将使用地面部队，使用的地面部队将不止像消息所说的两三连“喀麦隆高地军队”，而将是几个营。
    英国目前正在加紧调遣军队。塞浦路斯岛上的英军总部已经宣布，要把一营军队从怯尼亚空运到阿曼去镇压起义。23日，有两架运输机把驻在怯尼亚的英格兰第一步兵营的士兵一百人和他们的装备运走。据信，他们的目的地就是波斯湾的英军基地沙雅。
    华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特23日竭力掩饰阿曼事件里有着英美在这个地区争夺石油权益的因素。
    英国报纸已经指责美国的石油集团是英国在这个地区的利益的敌手，美国正在向阿曼起义者供应武器。
    怀特在记者一连串的问题下说，英国报纸这些消息“是笨拙的捏造”。
    怀特说，国务院“没有任何证据”证明有任何美国武器运到了阿曼地区。
    他说，美国是卖武器给沙特阿拉伯，并帮助训练它的军队。
    怀特说，英国经常把阿曼情况通知美国，美国目前“并没有表示要在这个争端中进行调停。”
