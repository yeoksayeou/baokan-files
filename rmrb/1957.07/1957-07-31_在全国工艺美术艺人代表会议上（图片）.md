At the National Congress of Arts and Crafts Artists
    The recently concluded National Congress of Arts and Crafts Artists was the first grand gathering of artists in history. Arts and crafts artists from all over the country and from various industries extensively exchanged experiences. They said, "This meeting is really great; such great unity is only possible under the socialist system." Our reporters Gao Liang, Wang Zhiyuan, and Yuan Yiping took these photos.
