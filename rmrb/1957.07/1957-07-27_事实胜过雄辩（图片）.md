Facts Speak Louder Than Words
Rightist elements say, "The Party and the government do not care about the suffering of the people," and "The cooperativization and the unified purchase and sales are terrible." Then look at the lives of the people in the disaster area of Hebei Province last year!

In early August last year, Li Bazhuang, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, suffered a devastating flood unprecedented in history. All the land in the village was submerged, and 530 houses collapsed. After the disaster, the state immediately distributed 12,000 yuan in various relief funds and loans to the village, as well as 330 pieces of winter clothing. The agricultural cooperative organized the disaster victims to engage in various sideline productions, with a total income of 47,180 yuan by May of this year. Not a single person in the village was displaced or fled famine.

Zhang Shubin (left), an orphan who used to be hungry and cold, and his grandmother Zhang Gu'er (widow) did not feel any hardship last year when the great flood occurred. Zhang Shubin is now a fifth-grade student in the complete primary school.

Members of the Huizhong Agricultural Cooperative in Li Bazhuang deeply appreciate the benefits of the unified grain purchase and sales policy. As soon as the wheat was harvested, they busied themselves handing over public grain to the state.

    事实胜过雄辩
    右派分子说：“党和政府不关心人民的疾苦”，“合作化和统购统销工作糟得很”。那么请看看去年河北省灾区的人民生活吧！
    去年8月初，河北省清苑县李八庄遭受了历史上从未有过的毁灭性的水灾，全村土地全部淹没，冲倒房屋五百三十间。受灾后，国家即时在这个村发放了各种救济款和贷款一万二千元，寒衣三百三十件；农业社又组织灾民搞各种副业生产，到今年5月共收入了四万七千一百八十元。全村没有一个人流离失所、向外逃荒。

    过去吃不饱、穿不暖的孤儿张树彬（左）和他的祖母张姑尔（寡妇），去年在发大水的情况下，他们一点也没有感到困难。张树彬现在是完小五年级的学生。
    李八庄惠众农业社的社员深深体会到粮食统购统销政策的好处，小麦刚收下来，便忙着向国家交纳公粮。
