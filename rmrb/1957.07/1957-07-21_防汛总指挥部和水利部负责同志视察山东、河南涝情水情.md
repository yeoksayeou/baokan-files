Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. Several responsible comrades from the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Ministry of Water Resources today inspected the situation of waterlogging and flooding in some areas of Shandong and Henan provinces and the Yellow River water conditions in Fanxian, Heze, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other places by special plane. They also listened to reports from the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters and the Henan Provincial Flood Control Department in Zhengzhou, and further studied the future flood control work of the Yellow River.

Since July, Shandong, Henan and other provinces have experienced continuous heavy rainfall, and some areas have suffered flood disasters. Yesterday, a flood peak of 13,000 cubic meters per second appeared at Huayuankou on the Yellow River. The Yellow River's flood control work has now entered a tense stage. For this reason, the Central Flood Control Headquarters has also listed the Yellow River's flood control work as one of the key points of the current flood control work. When the Huayuankou flood peak appeared yesterday, the person in charge of the central flood control department immediately called and instructed the local flood control department to strictly guard the embankment. Now the Huayuankou flood peak has entered Shandong Province.

According to people who returned from the inspection today, some villages near Heze in Shandong are still surrounded by floodwater, and the water level in some places seems to have receded compared to before. The waterlogging in the Guide area of eastern Henan is serious, and emergency rescue is underway locally.

From the beginning of July to the present, the Central Flood Control Headquarters has allocated several million yuan of flood control funds to various places and airdropped a large number of flood control and rescue materials and grain, which has strongly supported the flood control struggle in various places.

    防汛总指挥部和水利部负责同志视察山东、河南涝情水情
    新华社20日讯  中央防汛总指挥部和水利部的几个负责同志，今天乘专机视察了山东、河南两省的部分地区积雨内涝情况和范县、菏泽、开封、郑州等地的黄河水情，并在郑州市听取了黄河防汛总指挥部和河南省防汛部门的汇报，对今后黄河的防汛工作作了进一步的研究。
    7月份以来，山东、河南等省连降暴雨，有的地区暴雨成灾，昨天黄河花园口出现了一万三千秒公方流量的洪峰，现在黄河的防汛工作已经进入紧张阶段。为此中央防汛总指挥部也把黄河的防汛工作列入目前防汛工作的重点之一。当昨天花园口洪峰出现后，中央防汛部门的负责人就立即打电话指示当地防汛部门严守大堤。现在花园口的洪峰已进入山东省境内。
    据今天视察归来的人说，山东菏泽附近有些村庄还被积水围困，有的地方积水较前似有退落。豫东雎县一带内涝严重，当地正在进行紧急抢救。
    从7月初到现在，中央防汛总指挥部已向各地拨出了几百万元的防汛费和空投了大批的防汛抢救物资和粮食等，有力地支援了各地的防汛斗争。
