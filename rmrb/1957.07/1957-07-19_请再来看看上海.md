    Please Come and See Shanghai Again
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Ying
    Friend, have you ever been to Shanghai before? You must still remember the scenes of many sins and disasters in this city. Today, eight years after the liberation of Shanghai, please come and see it again. Perhaps, you won't recognize it, and may even ask in doubt, "Is this Shanghai?"
    It is summer now. At night, the breeze from the Huangpu River is gentle, and the music is melodious. Tourists are enjoying the cool air in the newly opened green areas by the river. During the day, on the hot river surface, you will see some divers wearing iron masks diving in and out of the water, salvaging materials and laying water pipes. Friend, if you take a boat trip on the Huangpu River for a month now, you will no longer encounter gangs of "water rats" emerging from the water, stealing boat equipment, damaging boat bottoms, and robbing luggage. You will no longer see, as you did eight years ago, more than ten corpses of murder and suicide victims floating on the river every month.
    At the various docks where the "Thirty-Six Gangs" of hooligans used to gather, there is now a scene of peace and tranquility. Passengers always entrust porters to carry away their heavy luggage with peace of mind, and no one has to worry about their luggage being cut open and stolen by thieves halfway.
    Walking from the Bund to the city center, you can sometimes see vehicles with sirens speeding on the road. These are white ambulances, not the red garrison vehicles of the past. Most of these garrison vehicles, once known as "flying fortresses," have now been converted into freight trucks. Only two are still parked in the parking lot on the ground floor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau building, their bodies covered with dust due to years of disuse. Standing on the sidewalk shouting are no longer beggars, nor are they sellers of fake medicines, fake jewelry, or "pickpocket tigers" who use chess and playing cards to swindle pedestrians out of their money. Instead, they are mobile vendors selling all kinds of utensils and food. Some of them used to be thieves, but after being reformed, they have now become self-reliant laborers.
    You may ask: Why don't the police officers maintaining social order, like the former patrolmen and policemen, wear whistles around their necks and guns around their waists? Why have more than 93% of enterprises, factories, and private residences of capitalists that were equipped with burglar alarms dismantled them? Why are many cells in Tilanqiao Prison able to be vacated and turned into workshops?
    Let the materials from the public security organs answer!
    According to their statistics: In the eight years since liberation, the number of criminal offenders in Shanghai has been declining steadily every year. In 1950, there were more than 40,000 criminal offenders. In the year and a half from 1956 to the present, the number of criminal offenders has been reduced to more than 5,000. Among various criminal cases, serious cases such as kidnapping, drug trafficking and transportation, and disrupting financial markets and speculative trading, which were notorious in Shanghai for more than 30 years, have almost disappeared. More than 800 robbery cases occurred in 1946. From June 1956 to June of this year, not a single case has occurred for thirteen consecutive months, and only three attempted robbery cases have occurred.
    Walking from the city center to various shantytowns, you can see that many bottleneck buildings in traffic lanes are continuing to be demolished, and a road running north-south through the old city of Shanghai is being developed. Various vehicles move back and forth in an orderly manner under the direction of the police. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has trained more than 30,000 volunteer propagandists to assist the police and regularly publicize traffic rules to the general public, which has reduced the number of traffic accidents in the city year by year.
    In the past, fires caused the city to lose property worth more than 10 million yuan in Renminbi every year, and many poor elderly people who suffered repeated disasters became mentally ill and even committed suicide. However, in the eight years since liberation, this disaster, which caused the greatest accidental losses to the working people, has been greatly reduced. In order to effectively prevent fires, more than 50,000 households in the city have converted to safe stoves, and more residents have received assistance from fire departments, often carrying out fire prevention work such as clearing chimneys and checking electrical wires to plug loopholes in fire hazards. According to statistics from the Shanghai Fire Department, in the first half of this year, more than 93% of the city's shantytown residents (approximately 840,000 people) have not suffered a single fire. If we look at the city as a whole, the average annual loss from fires in the eight years since the liberation of Shanghai has been reduced by 96% compared with the last year (1948) of the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule over Shanghai.
    In Shanghai, the public security organs can do their best to help you find relatives and friends or find children who have been lost on the way. Hundreds of families who have been separated for more than ten years, or even fifty years, have been reunited in Shanghai. Every year, many mothers retrieve their children, who have been lost for a time, from the public security organs' lost children reception rooms and the more than 200 police stations distributed throughout the city. If someone wants to find lost property, it can be found at the docks or at various public transportation service agencies and various cultural and entertainment venues in Shanghai. Since last year, more than 5,000 owners have retrieved their lost property from these places, and there are still tens of thousands of lost items waiting for their owners to claim them.
    Friend, this is today's Shanghai. Don't you think it has undergone tremendous changes? Arno, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the British Workers' Daily, who came to Shanghai last winter, said: "These phenomena of stable social order show that your government and state organ cadres are very concerned and responsible for the people. It is impossible to do this in London as you do, because the political systems of London and Shanghai are different."
    Friend, some people say: "The Communist Party does not know how to manage cities," and some people say, "Shanghai is shrouded in lawless and chaotic smog"? What is the basis for these people's claims? What are their intentions?

### 请再来看看上海

    请再来看看上海
    新华社记者  鲁影
    朋友，你从前到过上海吗？你一定还记得这座城市许多罪恶和灾难的景象。在上海解放八年后的今天，请你再来看看吧，也许，你不认识它了，甚至会怀疑地问：“这就是上海吗”？
    现在正是夏天，夜晚黄浦江上江风拂面，琴声悠扬，游客们在江边新辟的绿化地带纳凉。白天，炎热的江面上，你会看到一些戴铁面具的潜水员在水中钻进钻出，打捞物资和埋设水管。朋友，你现在要是乘船在黄浦江上游览一个月，你也不会再遭遇到成群结帮的“水老鼠”从水里钻出来，偷船具，捣船底，抢行李等种种威胁，你再也看不到像八年前那样，每个月总有十多具被杀和自杀者的尸体在江面上飘荡。
    在当年“三十六股党”流氓猬集的各个码头上，现在是一片安宁情景。旅客们总是放心地让搬运工人搬走笨重的行李，谁也不用担心行李会半途被小偷的刀割得精光。
    从外滩走向市中心区，有时可以看到发出警报声的车子在马路上疾驶，那是白色救护车，不是当年的红色警备车，这种曾被号称“飞行堡垒”的警备车，现在大多数已改装作运货车了，只有两部还放在市公安机关大楼底层的停车场，由于多年没有使用，车身上已积满了灰尘。站在人行道上叫喊的，已不是乞丐，也不是卖假药、假手饰物，以及用象棋、扑克来骗取行人财物的“扒窃虎”，而是售卖各色各样用具、食品的流动摊贩，他们中间，有些人以前曾是偷窃犯，经过改造以后现在已成为自食其力的劳动者。
    你或许会问：为什么维持社会秩序的民警，没有像当年的巡捕、警察一样，颈挂警笛，腰束手枪？为什么93％以上装有防盗警铃的企业、工厂和资本家私人住宅要把警铃拆掉？为什么提篮桥监狱的很多监房竟能空出来变作工场？
    还是让公安机关的材料来回答吧！
    根据他们的统计：解放八年来，上海的刑事罪犯，每年在直线下降。1950年刑事犯四万多人，1956年到目前的一年半中，刑事犯已减至五千多人。在各种刑事案件中，闻名上海三十多年的绑票、制贩运毒和扰乱金融、投机买卖等严重案件已近绝迹；抢劫案在1946年发生八百多件，从1956年6月到今年6月，连续十三个月没有发生一件，仅仅发生过三件抢劫未遂案。
    从市中心向各处棚户区走去，你可以看到很多交通道中的瓶头建筑正在继续拆除，一条贯通上海旧城区南北的马路正在开拓；各种车辆顺着民警的指挥，有秩序地来回行驶。上海公安机关训练了三万多个义务宣传员，专门协助民警，经常向广大居民宣传交通规则，这样就使得城市的车祸逐年减少。
    过去火灾曾使这个城市每年损失价值人民币一千多万元的财产，很多连遭灾祸的贫苦老人因此患精神病，甚至自杀。可是解放后八年来，这种对劳动人民意外损失最大的灾难已大量减少。为了有效地防火，全市有五万多户居民改装了安全炉灶，更多的居民得到消防机关的帮助，经常进行通烟囱、查电线等种种堵塞火险漏洞的防火工作。据上海消防机关统计，今年上半年，占全市93％以上的棚户居民（约八十四万人），没有遭到过一次火灾。如果从全市来看，上海解放八年来的火灾，同国民党反动派统治上海最后一年（1948年）比较，每年损失数平均要减少96％。
    在上海寻亲问友或找回途中失散的子女，公安机关可以尽力帮你找到。成百个骨肉分离十多年，甚至五十年的亲人们都在上海团圆了。每年有许多母亲从公安机关的迷童招待室，和分布全市的二百多个派出所里领回了一度走散的孩子；如果有人要寻找失物，不管是在码头上或在上海各种公共交通服务机关、各个文娱场所都可能找到。去年以来，有五千多个失主从这些地方领回了失物，现在还有数以万计的失物等待失主招领。
    朋友，这就是今日的上海。你不认为它已经发生巨大的变化吗？去冬来上海的英国工人日报副总编辑阿诺特说：“这种种社会秩序安定的现象，是说明你们政府和国家机关干部对人民很关心，很负责。要像你们这样，在伦敦办不到，因为伦敦和上海的政治制度不同”。
    朋友，有人说：“共产党不会管理城市”，有人说“上海被无法无天的乌烟瘴气笼罩着”？这些人的根据在那里？居心是什么？
