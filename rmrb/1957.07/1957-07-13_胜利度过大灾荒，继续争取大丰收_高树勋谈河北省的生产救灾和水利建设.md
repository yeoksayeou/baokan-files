I support Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and am determined to strive to implement the major tasks proposed in these reports.

Now, I will talk about Hebei Province's production for disaster relief and water conservancy work.

Hebei Experiences Many Natural Disasters

Due to its geographical and natural conditions, Hebei Province experiences many water and drought disasters, especially water disasters, which occur almost every year. Since the founding of the country in 1949, there have been four major floods, each inundating no less than 30 million mu of land. In 1956 in particular, the rainfall was excessive and the floods were fierce. Although more than 20,000 cadres, 1.5 million laborers, and tens of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers fought day and night against the floods during the flood season, managing to protect some important dikes and areas, the floods exceeded the guaranteed standard by a factor of one or even several, and the downstream discharge capacity into the sea was dozens or even nearly a hundred times lower than the upstream inflow. In the face of irresistible forces, some rivers breached their banks, causing severe flooding. The entire province had 45 million mu of cultivated land inundated, resulting in a reduction of 5 billion jin of grain and more than 300 million jin of cotton. Many villages were destroyed, and more than 2.6 million houses collapsed. The affected population was 15 million, accounting for more than one-third of the province's population. This brought serious difficulties to agricultural production and the people's lives in the disaster areas.

Cadres and Party Members Share Hardships with Disaster Victims

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Central Committee and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, we have waged a difficult struggle against the famine. On the one hand, we actively transported large quantities of materials to the disaster areas, promptly distributed relief funds, and led the people to drain water and sow wheat in order to stabilize the emotions of the disaster victims and shorten the disaster period. On the other hand, we implemented the policy of self-reliance through production and frugality in overcoming the famine, and vigorously developed sideline production. Here, Communist Party members and cadres demonstrated a high degree of sharing weal and woe with the disaster victims, standing at the forefront of the struggle, going wherever it was most difficult. Some Party members, cadres, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, in order to rescue disaster victims and state materials, and to overcome the disaster and famine, overworked themselves, and even sacrificed their most precious lives, leaving an indelible impression on the masses. Through the struggle against the famine and the self-reliance through production movement, we ensured that the disaster victims had food, clothing, and shelter, their emotions were stable, and there were no instances of fleeing elsewhere, and we victoriously overcame the famine. Moreover, on this basis, we created conditions for striving for a large agricultural harvest.

It Would Have Been Terrible Without Cooperativization

In the process of fighting against the famine, we closely relied on agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives demonstrated unparalleled superiority. After the disaster last year, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the agricultural cooperatives actively organized the masses to drain water and sow wheat, planting 38 million mu of winter wheat in just one month, and now the wheat has been harvested, shortening the disaster period. They mobilized members to cut and store green grass and silage corn stalks, and systematically adopted methods such as grazing, fostering, and state regulation of livestock, basically preserving the livestock. They unified the planning of labor, appropriately arranged agricultural and sideline production, solved the difficulties of insufficient labor and technology and the contradictions between agricultural and sideline production, and ensured the widespread development of sideline production. During the peak period of sideline production, 4.6 million disaster victims participated in sideline occupations, accounting for 58.5 percent of the labor force in the disaster areas. Before the wheat harvest this year, the income from sideline occupations in the disaster areas was more than 200 million yuan, which could buy 2.5 billion jin of grain, effectively solving the production and living difficulties of the disaster victims. In addition, agricultural cooperatives built more than 920,000 houses for the disaster victims, providing them with shelter.

These things would have been impossible without cooperativization. As the disaster victims said, "Without the collective strength of cooperativization, not only would livestock not have been preserved, but people would probably not have been able to live in houses or have food to eat." Recalling the old society, every time there was a famine year, countless people were ruined and displaced. For example, in Beigao Village, Nanhe County, more than 370 people starved to death in the 1917 flood, 670 people fled, 23 families were separated, and 28 families sold their children. At that time, the people were starving and there were corpses in the fields. Although last year's flood in this village was much larger than in 1917, thanks to the collective strength of cooperativization, sideline production was vigorously developed, and the people's production and lives were very good, with even a surplus, and they deposited more than 5,000 yuan in the credit cooperative. There are countless similar situations. Therefore, it can be said that cooperativization not only withstands the test of famine but is also further consolidated through the struggle against famine.

It Would Have Been Terrible Without Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain

In the process of fighting against the famine, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain demonstrated unparalleled vitality. Because of the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the state had the strength to carry out the unified regulation of grain, ensuring the grain needs of the disaster areas and the overall stability of prices. In the 1956-1957 fiscal year, the state allocated 3.6 billion jin of grain to Hebei Province. This grain came from more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. The disaster victims had grain to eat, and the price was very reasonable, without any increase, and some even decreased. The disaster victims said, "The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is a 'life-saving policy.' Without it, people could not live!" These are heartfelt words. One cannot help but recall that in the old society, in the face of such a famine year, prices would have risen to unimaginable heights, and countless people would have starved to death. Hebei Province suffered a drought in 1943. At that time, the masses had to repay three dou of grain for every dou of grain borrowed from the landlords, and thousands upon thousands of people were deprived of their lives. That tragic scene is in stark contrast to the present. It can be seen that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is indeed a "life-saving policy" and is resolutely supported by the masses of the people.

Support from the Central Committee and the People of the Whole Country

In the process of fighting against the famine, the Central Committee successively allocated more than 110 million yuan in emergency relief funds and relief funds to Hebei Province, 70 million yuan in work-relief project funds, 110 million yuan in loans, and transported large quantities of disaster relief materials to help solve the production and living difficulties of the people in the disaster areas. The relief funds alone were equivalent to more than twice the profits of Hebei Province's local state-owned industrial enterprises last year and accounted for the majority of the province's agricultural tax revenue last year. The people of more than 20 fraternal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions and many fraternal ethnic groups tightened their belts and transported grain and other materials to the disaster areas of Hebei Province, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, enduring many difficulties. Our successful overcoming of the famine is inseparable from the support of the Central Committee and the people of the whole country. On behalf of the people of Hebei Province, I express my heartfelt thanks to the Central Committee and the people of the whole country.

Obviously, the state's spending huge sums of money to solve the people's difficulties and the ability of all ethnic groups in the country to display such a high degree of class friendship are things that have never happened in any dynasty in history. Only a socialist country led by the working class and its party, the Communist Party, and the people who are now the masters of their own destiny, can do such earth-shattering things.

The 40 million people of Hebei Province deeply realize that with the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the socialist system and the support of the people of the whole country, even the greatest famine can be overcome, and even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. In recent times, bourgeois right-wingers with wild ambitions have stubbornly insisted on fallacies such as "the socialist system is inferior to the capitalist system," "the Party and the government do not care about the people's suffering," "the people's lives are very hard," and "cooperativization and the unified purchase and sale of grain are terrible," using the most insidious and familiar means of slander, rumor-mongering, and deception, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and restore capitalism. The Chinese people, who have experienced many changes, have a clear sense of love and hatred and will unite more closely around the Communist Party and the People's Government to safeguard the interests of the Party and their own vital interests, defend the achievements of socialist construction, and resolutely wage a merciless struggle against all anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and actions. Any conspiracy by bourgeois right-wingers will never succeed.

Great Achievements Have Been Made in Water Conservancy Construction

Due to the large number of water and drought disasters in Hebei Province (mainly water disasters), grain cannot be self-sufficient, and the state has to transfer large quantities of grain from various places every year, which is a major problem. In order to achieve grain self-sufficiency in a relatively short period of time, one of the key measures is to completely eradicate water disasters and develop water conservancy. This is not only the most important thing for the people of Hebei Province but also something that the Central Committee and all parts of the country are very concerned about. In the past few years since liberation, under the leadership of the Central Committee, we have made great efforts in water conservancy construction, completing 170 million cubic meters of earthwork and investing more than 300 million yuan (not including the Guanting Reservoir project directly undertaken by the Central Committee in Hebei Province), which is equivalent to eight times the total national water conservancy investment during the Kuomintang period from 1941 to 1948. In terms of preventing and eliminating water disasters, the Guanting Reservoir and the Douhe Reservoir have been built; the dikes of various rivers have been restored and reinforced, and the middle and lower reaches of the rivers have been dredged; the Duliu Reduction River and the Qingdianwa and other flood detention areas have been opened, and more than 30 large drainage projects have been dug; at the same time, more than 400,000 gully dams, more than 500 small reservoirs, and various soil and water conservation projects have been built in the mountainous areas, and soil and water conservation is currently playing a role in an area of 30,000 square kilometers. In terms of mass flood prevention, 30 million mu of ridge and furrow fields and ditch and furrow fields have been completed, and 6 million mu of low-lying land have been transformed. In terms of farmland irrigation, in addition to the construction and expansion of some large-scale irrigation projects, a total of 1.3 million wells have been drilled and more than 200 pumping stations have been established in recent years, plus small canals and weirs, the total irrigated area in the province has increased from 12.35 million mu before liberation to 27 million mu. These projects have played an important role in flood control, drainage, and drought prevention. Through the above-mentioned water conservancy construction, the people of the province have had a profound experience in adapting to nature, transforming nature, and utilizing nature, especially after the realization of agricultural cooperativization in the winter of 1955, which has extensively promoted the mass utilization and transformation of nature, increasing agricultural production. For example, Zhangjiakou Prefecture has used flood silt to fill 1.49 million mu of land in recent years, and crops are growing very well. According to the characteristics of the low-lying areas, Tianjin Prefecture transformed and replanted 4.2 million mu, according to the statistics of 2.1 million mu of them: Grain production increased by 48 million jin, and hemp production increased by 14 million jin. Although it suffered a severe flood in 1956, the region harvested more than 800 million jin of grain in 50 low-lying areas, accounting for 68.6 percent of the region's total output, which was more than the region's total output in 1954. Another example is Mancheng County. Due to comprehensive planning and comprehensive management, soil and water conservation in the mountainous areas has initially controlled 58 percent of the total area in the past year; 390,000 mu of ditch and furrow fields and terrace fields have been built in the plains and low-lying areas, making the "toad pits" and "regret lands" that have not yielded harvests for nine years out of ten also obtained good harvests, with yields of 100 to 200 jin per mu, and high-yield lands reaching more than 800 jin.

The various water conservancy constructions carried out by the people of Hebei Province with great enthusiasm in recent years, and the arduous struggles against water and drought disasters based on these water conservancy projects, have achieved significant results. Taking the water disaster as an example, the 1956 flood in Hebei Province was the largest flood since hydrological records began, much larger than that in 1939, but in 1939, 71 million mu of land were flooded in the province, and the flood inundated Tianjin City for more than two months; while in 1956, the flooded area was smaller than in 1939, Tianjin City was safe and sound, and the Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Pukou and other lines operated normally. This is a clear contrast.

Overemphasis on "Lines" and Neglect of "Areas" in Water Conservancy Construction

Of course, in water conservancy construction work, we also have many shortcomings. The main ones are: Insufficient overall planning and comprehensive arrangement. In water management, there is an overemphasis on the management of "lines" and a neglect of the control of "areas." Some projects have left behind some new problems after completion, forming water disputes between upstream and downstream areas; in the undertaking of projects, there are few projects to cure the "root cause," and instead, we have been in a passive state of treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts for a long time; in leadership thinking, not enough attention has been paid to relying on the masses and giving play to the active factors of the masses, and there is a thought of relying solely on state investment to undertake projects; in addition, there is a lack of in-depth investigation and research and popularization of the rich experience of the masses in water management, thus affecting the widespread development of mass water conservancy work. These must be given high attention and overcome seriously.

In order to effectively reduce water and drought disasters in Hebei Province and solve the problem of grain self-sufficiency, we believe that water conservancy construction must be comprehensively planned and comprehensively managed, and the large- and medium-sized projects undertaken by the state must be closely combined with the mass water conservancy construction cause.

Further Promote Mass Water Conservancy Construction

First, give full play to the active factors of the masses and vigorously carry out mass water conservancy construction, especially in the near future, focusing on mass and comprehensive water conservancy construction to achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. For small-scale mass flood prevention, drainage, and drought prevention projects, there has been a relatively widespread development in the past two years, and some experience has been accumulated, especially after cooperativization, which has brought favorable conditions. In order to carry out the work in a planned and step-by-step manner in the future, we have drafted a recent water conservancy plan focusing on mass water conservancy construction in the province based on the general requirements of the Haihe River Basin plan, with the second five-year plan as the planning period, and focused on arranging the project items for 1958. Now, we have gone to the special districts, counties, townships, and the masses to solicit opinions, verify the situation, and collect materials for further supplementation and correction. We plan to continue to vigorously engage in soil and water conservation projects in the mountainous areas, especially to build more small reservoirs, because small reservoirs are very effective in developing irrigation in the mountainous areas and controlling mountain water runoff, especially when they are built in gullies that have water all year round, they can store water for irrigation, which can meet the current production needs, and the enthusiasm of the masses is even higher, which is the focus of developing soil and water conservation in the mountainous areas. At the same time, we must also carry out various engineering projects such as repairing terraces, cultivating forests, silt dams, fish-scale pits, and contour ditches according to local conditions and in various ways, so that they can cooperate with small reservoirs and give full play to the role of soil and water conservation in an all-round way. This year, we require the completion of 400 small reservoirs, the planting of 1.2 million mu of afforestation, together with gully dam projects and other field projects, which can initially control a drainage area of 5,000 square kilometers. During the second five-year plan, we plan to initially control two-fifths to one-half of the 120,000 square kilometers of mountainous area in the province through various soil and water conservation measures. In order to do a good job in the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry in the mountainous areas, we have established a mountainous area production and construction committee to further strengthen this work and give play to its comprehensive leadership role. In the plain areas, we will widely carry out mass flood prevention and drainage projects, carry out ditch and furrow fields, ridge and furrow fields, repair drainage ditches and canals, make full use of pits and ponds to store water, and control surface runoff. The transformation and utilization of low-lying areas have also been comprehensively arranged to carry out terrace fields, enclosed fields, or drainage and irrigation projects, and promote crop replacement according to the production conditions of the low-lying areas. In the first half of this year, more than 8 million mu of ditch and furrow fields, terrace fields, and low-lying area transformation projects have been repaired, and we will continue to vigorously carry them out in the autumn. During the second five-year plan, we require that rainwater that occurs once every five years will not cause disasters. In terms of drought prevention, we will focus on developing and utilizing groundwater resources, vigorously developing wells, digging irrigation canals, and expanding the irrigated area. It is preliminarily planned to develop another 20 million mu in five years. By 1962, the irrigated area will be expanded to 47 million mu, and the average farmer in the province will have more than one mu of irrigated land. In order to realize the above plan, we are preparing to launch counties, townships, and cooperatives to formulate water conservancy plans in the autumn of this year, and require that this winter and next spring, a mass water conservancy movement be launched throughout the province to push mass water conservancy construction to a climax.

Large, Medium, and Small Water Conservancy Facilities Should Be Closely Integrated

Second, while extensively carrying out mass water conservancy construction work, it is also necessary to actively undertake large- and medium-sized water conservancy projects, so that large, medium, and small water conservancy facilities are closely integrated. Mass water conservancy projects play an important role in flood prevention, drainage, and drought prevention, but due to their low design standards, their flood and drainage capacity has certain limitations. Hebei Province has so many rivers, concentrated heavy rains during the flood season, and complex terrain, making it impossible to control them in the event of heavy rains and floods. Therefore, it is necessary to build pivotal large-scale projects to completely eradicate the Haihe River system. This will not only solve the serious threat of water disasters to agricultural production in Hebei, but it is also important for ensuring the safety of cities such as the capital and Tianjin and railway transportation.

In order to completely eradicate the Haihe River system, the State Council recently approved the establishment of the Haihe River System Management Committee, which we are very excited about. In recent years, we have seen the great achievements of the Huaihe River management and the great beginning of the Yellow River management, which is very encouraging. We urgently hope that the systematic eradication work of the Haihe River system can also begin as soon as possible according to plan. In view of the large area of the Haihe River system and the very heavy tasks of surveying, design, and construction, it is far beyond the capacity of one province. The Haihe River System Management Committee, which has now been announced, is still a liaison agency, and there are no office agencies below it. We hope that a substantive institution will be established under the committee, a fixed organization will be established, and sufficient cadres and technical forces will be equipped to directly control and carry out the management planning, surveying, design, and construction work of the entire basin.

The management steps of the Haihe River system should be determined according to the conditions of national economic, technical strength, and labor. In the near future, rivers that are seriously harmful should be managed first. From the perspective of the entire province of Hebei, the three river systems of Zhang, Wei, Nanyunhe, and Ziya River, Daqing River, including the vast grain and cotton producing areas of southern Hebei and central Hebei, have been the most severely damaged over the years and should be managed first. In the preparation of the basin management plan, engineering measures during the second five-year plan period have been proposed, focusing on the management of Nanyunhe, Ziya River, and the southern branch of the Daqing River. The people of Hebei Province and the Hebei delegation believe that this is a minimum requirement and hope that it can be fully realized within five years. If the national economic strength and technical strength are possible, we request the Central Committee to include the root eradication projects of the above three rivers in the national plan for the second five years to eliminate the water disasters of these three rivers, solve the self-sufficiency of grain, and ensure a large agricultural harvest.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions.

    胜利度过大灾荒，继续争取大丰收
    高树勋谈河北省的生产救灾和水利建设
    我拥护毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并且坚决为贯彻实现各报告中所提出的重大任务而奋斗。
    现在，我谈谈河北省的生产救灾和水利工作。
    河北自然灾害多
    河北省由于地理条件和自然条件的关系，水、旱灾害较多，尤其是水灾，几乎每年发生。从一九四九年建国以来，较大的水灾就有四次，每次淹地都不下三千万亩，特别是一九五六年，雨水过大、洪水过猛，虽然，汛期有两万多干部、一百五十多万民工和数万人民解放军夜以继日地向洪水搏斗，曾保住了一些重要堤防和地区的安全，但是，因为洪水超过了保证标准一倍甚至数倍，下游入海尾闾泄水能力低于上游的来水量的数十倍甚至近百倍，在没法抗拒的情况下，致使一些河流漫决，造成了严重的水灾。全省淹没耕地四千五百万亩，减产了粮食五十亿斤，棉花三亿多斤；冲毁了不少村庄，倒塌了二百六十多万间房屋；受灾人口一千五百万，占全省人口三分之一以上。这就给灾区的农业生产和人民的生活带来了严重的困难。
    干部党员同灾民共患难
    一年来，我们在中央的领导下和全国人民的大力支持下，向灾荒作了艰巨的斗争。一方面，积极地向灾区运送了大批物资，及时发放了救济款，领导着人民进行了排水种麦，以期稳定灾民情绪，缩短灾期；另一方面，贯彻了生产自救、节约渡荒的方针，大力开展了副业生产。这里，共产党员和干部表现了高度的同灾民同甘苦、共患难的精神，站在斗争的前列，那里最苦、困难最大就到那里去。有的党员、干部和人民解放军，为了抢救灾民和国家物资，为了救灾渡荒忙坏了自己的身体，甚至献出了自己最宝贵的生命，在群众中留下了不可磨灭的印象。通过向灾荒斗争和生产自救运动，保障了灾民有吃有穿有住，情绪稳定、没有发生过外逃现象，饱满胜利地渡过了灾荒。并且在这一基础上为争取农业大丰收创造了条件。
      没有合作化就糟了
    我们在向灾荒斗争过程中，是紧紧依靠农业合作社进行的。农业合作社显示了无比的优越性。当去年灾后，各农业社在党和人民政府领导下，积极组织了群众排水种麦，在短短一个月内，播种了冬小麦三千八百万亩，现在小麦已经收割完毕，缩短了灾期；发动了社员打贮青草、青贮玉米秸、有计划地采取对牲畜放牧、寄养、寄牧和国家调剂等方法，基本上把牲畜保存下来；统一规划了劳力，恰当地安排了农、副业生产，解决了劳力、技术不足的困难和农、副业生产的矛盾，保障了副业的普遍开展。在副业生产高潮时期，参加副业的灾民达四百六十万人，占灾区劳力的百分之五十八点五，到今年麦收以前，灾区副业收入二亿多元，可买二十五亿斤粮食，有力地解决了灾民的生产生活困难。此外，通过农业社给灾民盖房九十二万多间，使灾民有了住处。
    这些，没有合作化是不可能办到的。正如灾民所说：“如果没有合作化的集体力量，不仅牲口保不住；人也恐怕住不上房子，吃不上饭。”回想在旧社会里，每逢灾荒年，不知要有多少人倾家荡产，流离失所。例如：南和县北高村一九一七年闹水灾时，饿死了三百七十多人，外逃六百七十人，妻离子散的二十三户，卖儿女的二十八户，当时是民有饥色，野有饿殍。虽然这个村去年水灾要比一九一七年大的多，由于合作化的集体力量，大力搞了副业生产，人民的生产生活都很好，并且还有富余，在信用社里存了五千多块钱，类似这样的情况是不胜枚举的。因此，可以说合作化不仅经得起灾荒的考验，而且通过向灾荒斗争，进一步得到了巩固。没有粮食统购统销也就糟了
    在向灾荒斗争过程中，粮食统购统销政策显示了无比的生命力。由于实行了粮食统销政策，国家才有力量进行粮食的统一调剂，保证了灾区粮食需要和物价的全面稳定。一九五六——一九五七年度国家调给河北省的粮食有三十六亿斤，这些粮食，来自全国二十多个省、市、自治区，灾民既有粮食吃，价钱又很合理，一个钱也没涨，有的还落了价。灾民说：“粮食统购统销政策是‘救命政策’，没有它，人民就不能活！”这真是肺腑之言。不能不使人想起，若是在旧社会里，遇到这样的灾荒年，物价不知要涨多高，不知要有多少人饿死。河北省一九四三年遭了旱灾，当时群众向地主借一斗粮要还三斗，上千上万的人被剥夺了生命。那种惨景与现在恰恰成为对比。可见，粮食统购统销政策确实是“救命政策”，为人民群众坚决拥护的。
    中央和全国人民的支援
    在向灾荒斗争过程中，中央先后拨发给河北省急赈款、救济款一亿一千多万元，以工代赈工程款七千万元，贷款一亿一千元和调运了大批救灾物资，帮助解决灾区人民生产生活的困难。只救济款一项，就相当去年河北省地方国营工业企业利润的两倍多，相当去年全省农业税收的多数。有二十多个兄弟省、市、自治区的人民和许多兄弟民族，节衣缩食，并为河北省灾区运送粮食和其他物资而爬山涉水，披星戴月，经历了重重困难。我们能够胜利地渡过灾荒，是与中央和全国人民的支持分不开的。我代表河北省人民向中央和全国人民衷心致谢。
    很明显，国家拿出巨款来解决人民的困难，全国各族人民能以发扬如此高度的阶级友爱，是历史上任何朝代所没有的事情，只有以工人阶级及其政党——共产党为领导的社会主义制度的国家，和当了家做了主的人民，才能作出这样惊天动地的大事情。
    河北省四千万人民深深体验到：有了共产党和人民政府领导，有了社会主义制度和全国人民的支持，天大的灾荒也是可以战胜的，天大的困难也是能够克服的。近一个时期以来，资产阶级右派野心分子硬说：“社会主义制度不如资本主义制度”、“党和政府不关心人民的疾苦”、“人民生活苦得很”、“合作化和粮食统购统销工作糟得很”等等谬论，采用最阴毒的也是他们惯用的诬蔑、造谣和骗人的手段，企图达到推翻共产党的领导、推翻社会主义制度、使资本主义复辟的目的。饱经事变的中国人民，爱憎是分明的，将更加紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，为维护党的和自己的切身利益，保卫社会主义建设成果，坚决向一切反党反人民反社会主义的言论和行动作无情的斗争，任何资产阶级右派分子的阴谋活动是永远不会得逞的。
    水利建设已有很大成就
    河北省由于水、旱灾害较多（主要是水灾），粮食不能自给自足，每年国家要从各地调入大批粮食，这是一个很大的问题。为了在较短的时间内达到粮食自给自足，其中一个关键性的措施，就是必须要根治水患，开发水利。这不仅是河北省人民最关心的事情，而且也是中央和全国各地很关怀的事情。解放几年来，我们在中央的领导下，在水利建设上已经作了很大的努力，作了土方工程17000万公方，投资三亿多元，（不包括中央直接在河北省举办的官厅水库工程）相当国民党时期一九四一年到一九四八年全国水利总投资的八倍。在防除水患方面，修建了官厅水库和陡河水库；恢复和加固了各河堤防，整理了中、下游河道；开辟了独流减河和青甸洼等滞洪区，挖了三十多条较大的排水工程；同时在山区修建了谷坊四十多万处、小型水库五百多座、以及多种多样的水土保持工程，目前已在三万平方公里的范围内起到了保持水土作用。在群众性的防涝方面，完成了土埂畦田、沟洫畦田等三千万亩，洼地改造六百万亩。在农田灌溉方面，除了新建和扩建了一些较大型的灌溉工程外，几年来共打井一百三十万眼，建立了抽水机站二百多处，再加上小型渠滩、水柜等，全省浇地面积已由解放前的一千二百三十五万亩增加到二千七百万亩。这些工程，在防洪、防涝和防旱方面，都起到了重要作用。通过上述水利建设，全省人民在适应自然、改造自然、利用自然等方面已有了深刻的体验，特别是一九五五年冬实现了农业合作化后，广泛地开展了群众性的对自然的利用和改造，使农业增了产。如张家口地区几年来用洪水淤放了一百四十九万亩，农作物长的很好。天津专区根据洼地的特点，改造和改种四百二十万亩，据其中的二百一十万亩的统计：即增产粮食四千八百万斤，产麻一千四百万斤，一九五六年虽然遭受了严重水灾，而该地区在五十个洼地收获粮食即达八亿多斤，占全区总产量的百分之六十八点六，比一九五四年全区产量还要多。又如满城县由于进行了全面规划和综合治理，一年来山区水土保持已经初步控制了总面积的百分之五十八；平原和洼地修了三十九万亩的沟洫畦田和台田，使十年九不收的“蛤蟆坑”、“后悔地”也获得了很好的收成，亩产一、二百斤粮食，丰产地达到八百多斤。
    河北省人民几年来以巨大的热情进行的各项水利建设，并且凭借着这些水利工程向水灾、旱灾进行的艰巨斗争，获得了重大成效。就以水灾为例，一九五六年河北省是有水文记载以来最大的一次洪水，比一九三九年要大的多，但是，一九三九年全省淹没了七千一百万亩地，洪水浸入天津市两个多月；而一九五六年比一九三九年淹地少，天津市安全无恙，京山、京浦等线正常通车。这就是个鲜明的对照。
    水利建设中偏重于“线”忽视了“面”
    当然，在水利建设工作中，我们也还存在着不少的缺点。主要是：统筹兼顾、全面安排不够。在治水当中偏重于“线”的治理，忽视了“面”的控制，有些工程修成后遗留下一些新问题，形成了上下游地区间的水利纠纷；在举办工程上，治“本”工程少，而是长期以来处在头痛治头、脚痛治脚的被动状态；在领导思想上，对依靠群众、发挥群众的积极因素注意不够，存在着单纯依靠国家投资举办工程的思想；再加上对群众治水的丰富经验缺乏深入调查研究和总结推广，因而影响了群众性的水利工作的广泛开展。这些，必须提起高度的注意，认真克服。
    为了有效地减轻河北省的水旱灾害，解决粮食自给自足问题，在水利建设上，我们认为，必须全面规划和进行综合治理，把国家举办的大、中型工程和群众性的水利建设事业密切结合起来。把群众性水利建设推进一步
    一、充分发挥群众的积极因素，大力开展群众性的水利建设，特别是在近期，则要以群众性、综合性的水利建设为主，达到多、快、好、省的要求。对于群众性的小型防洪、防涝和防旱工程，近两年来已经有了比较广泛的开展，并且积累了一些经验，特别是合作化后带来了有利条件。今后为了有计划有步骤地进行工作，我们已根据海河流域规划总的要求，草拟了全省以群众性水利建设为中心的近期水利规划，以第二个五年计划为规划年限，并着重安排了一九五八年的工程项目。现在，已到专、县、乡和群众中间征求意见，印证情况，搜集资料，作进一步补充修正。我们计划：在山区继续大力搞水土保持工程，特别要多修小型水库，因为小水库对发展山区灌溉、控制山水径流是很有成效的，尤其是在常年有水的沟谷里作，可以蓄水浇地，能够结合当前生产需要，群众积极性就更高，这是发展山区水土保持的重点。同时，还要因地制宜、多种多样地搞些整修梯田、培育林木、淤地坝、鱼鳞坑、水平沟等工程，使之同小水库配合起来，全面发挥水土保持的作用。今年要求修成小水库四百座，植树造林一百二十万亩，连同谷坊工程和其他田间工程共可初步控制流域面积五千平方公里。在第二个五年计划期间计划通过各种水土保持措施，把全省十二万平方公里的山区面积初步控制五分之二到二分之一。为了做好山区农、林、水、牧的综合治理，我们已经成立了山区生产建设委员会，进一步加强这方面的工作，使其发挥综合领导的作用。在平原地区，广泛开展群众性的防涝除涝工程，开展沟洫畦田、土埂畦田，整修排水沟渠，充分利用坑塘蓄水，控制地面径流。低洼地区的改造和利用，也进行了全面安排，开展台田、围田或排灌工程，并且根据洼地生产条件，推行作物改种。今年上半年已修沟洫畦田、台田和低洼地区改造工程八百多万亩，秋后还要继续大力开展。在第二个五年计划期间，要求解决五年一遇的雨水不致成灾。在防旱方面，当前以发掘与利用地下水源为主，大力发展水井、开挖灌渠，扩大浇地面积。初步计划在五年内再发展二千万亩。到一九六二年，灌溉面积扩大到四千七百万亩，全省农民每人平均有一亩多一点的水浇地。为了实现以上计划，准备在今年秋后，发动县、乡、社普遍制订水利规划，并且要求今冬明春，在全省范围内掀起一个群众性的水利运动，把群众性的水利建设推向高潮。大中小型水利设施密切结合
    二、在广泛开展群众性水利建设工作的同时，还需要积极举办大、中型水利工程，使大、中、小型水利设施密切结合起来。群众性的水利工程在防洪防涝和防旱方面是有着重要作用的，但由于它的设计标准低，御洪御涝能力有一定的局限性，像河北省河流这样多，汛期暴雨集中，地形复杂，一遇大雨大水就没法控制。因而必须修建枢纽性的大型工程，全面地根治海河水系。这样，不仅能解决水灾对河北农业生产的严重威胁，而且对保障首都、天津等城市和铁路交通的安全，也有着重要意义。
    为了根治海河水系，最近国务院批准成立了海河水系治理委员会，我们感到十分兴奋。几年来，我们看到治淮的巨大成就和治理黄河的伟大开端，令人十分鼓舞。我们迫切希望海河水系的系统根治工作也能够按照计划尽早开始。鉴于海河水系范围很大，勘测设计和施工任务都非常繁重，远非一省力量所能胜任。现在公布成立的海河水系治理委员会，还是一个联络机关，下边没设办事机构，我们希望在委员会下设立实职机构，建立固定组织，配备足够的干部力量和技术力量，对全流域的治理规划、勘测设计和施工工作，直接掌握进行。
    海河水系的治理步骤，应根据国家经济、技术力量和劳力等方面的条件来规定。近期应首先治理为害严重的河流。从河北全省看，漳、卫、南运河和子牙河、大清河等三条河系，包括着冀南、冀中广大粮、棉产区，历年为害最重，应先期治理。在编制流域治理规划当中，对第二个五年计划期间的工程措施，曾提出着重治理南运河、子牙河和大清河南支的任务，河北省人民和河北代表小组，认为这是一个最低限度的要求，希望能在五年内全部得到实现。如果国家经济力量和技术力量可能的话，我们要求中央将以上三条河的根治工程，列入第二个五年的国家计划之内实施，以解除这三条河流的水灾，解决粮食的自给自足保障农业大丰收。
    以上意见，请批评指正。
