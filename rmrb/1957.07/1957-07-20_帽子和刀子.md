    Hats and Knives
    Li Peicheng

    Some people are very dissatisfied with the "hats," thinking, "If there is injustice, there will be a cry," so why the talk of being anti-socialist, a rightist, or anti-Party? "The Communist Party throws hats around indiscriminately; it's outrageous..." Some kindly advise the Party to be careful, "lest people feel they are being 'collected'," while others take the opportunity to muddy the waters, weeping with their faces covered, as if all the blame lies with the hats.

    I, however, think differently. First, some hats fit well, and some do not. Unsuitable hats should not be thrown, lest people have difficulty lifting their heads. But if someone is dizzy and has signs of a cold, they should wear a suitable hat to avoid catching a severe cold. If someone has a serious flu and unconsciously intends to spread germs, they should be isolated immediately. Writing "There are infectious patients inside; others, take care" on the door might not be a bad thing. Furthermore, if some people mingle in the crowd, barging left and right, acting recklessly, thinking everyone has ears and eyes and no one can discern them, then someone shouting, "The one in the red robe is Cao Cao," cannot be said to have done no good.

    In fact, suitable hats are all made by oneself. Qin Hui became a traitor, Chiang Kai-shek became a national traitor, and Hu Feng became a counter-revolutionary—it is all like this. Zhang Bojun called himself a "socialist," wanting to "start a family based on the middle route and anti-communism," and called Hu Feng a "historical figure." It can be seen that the hat was indeed self-prepared; the Communist Party merely calls them anti-socialist, anti-communist, and rightists. Because the standpoints are different, each has its own term; this is natural and reasonable and nothing strange. I hope those who hate "big hats" will think thrice!

    As for saying that the hats are thrown around indiscriminately by the Communist Party, I think that's unlikely. People like Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, and Zhang Naiqi opened their own factories, doing and suffering on their own. If you don't believe it, look at the materials published in the newspapers; there is a clear lineage of when the thread was spun and woven, when it was cut and sewn. How can others share the credit!

    Some people say that the Communist Party is the ruling party, and the hats thrown out are too heavy... How can they not know that it is precisely because the Communist Party is the leader ruling for the people that ambitious people dare to attack the Party with such venom? If it were someone like me, Zhang Bojun would not bother with it.

    The Communist Party gave Zhang Bojun's hat a name, and some people think that is very wrong; but they are calm about Zhang and others wielding knives, what is the reason for this? Is it because the knife is hidden in the waist that it can be innocent?

    帽子和刀子
    李佩成
    有人对帽子甚为不满，以为“不平则鸣”，何又有反社会主义、右派分子、反党之说？“共产党乱抛帽子，真是岂有此理……”，好心的劝党当心，“不要令人有‘收’之感”，有的则趁此混水摸鱼，掩面干哭，似乎一切罪在帽子。
    我则以为不然，其一，帽子有合适的，也有不合适的，不合适的不应当抛，以免使人抬头困难。但若有人头昏脑胀已有伤风之兆，则应戴顶合适的帽子，以免重感风寒，若有人流感严重，而不自觉有意喷菌伤人，则应即速强行隔离，在门上若书以“内有传染病人，他人保重”，也未必不是好事。再若有些人杂于人群之中，左冲右撞，胡作非为，以为皆具耳目，人不可辨，那么，有人喊一声“穿红袍者是曹操”，也不能说其人无功。
    其实合适的帽子，都系自己造就，秦桧为奸贼，蒋介石为国贼，胡风为反革命，莫不如是。章伯钧自称为“社会主义者”，想靠“中间路线和反共起家”，呼胡风为“历史人物”，可见帽子亦确属自备，共产党不过呼之曰反社会主义，反共，右派分子而已。因为立足点不同，各有所称，原为天理人情，无甚奇处，望大恶帽子者三思！
    至于言帽子由共产党乱抛，我更以为未必；章伯钧、储安平、章乃器之流自开工厂，自作自受，不信可看报纸所登材料，何时纺线织布，何时裁剪缝成，自有来龙去脉，他人岂能沾光！
    有人言共产党为执政党，抛出的帽子太重……，岂不知正由于共产党执政为民之首领，才有野心家对党下此毒手，若我等者，章伯钧无心理睬。
    章伯钧的帽子，共产党起了个名字，有人就以为十分不是；而他们对章等玩弄刀子却处之泰然，这是什么道理呢？难道因为刀子是藏在腰里就可以无罪吗？
