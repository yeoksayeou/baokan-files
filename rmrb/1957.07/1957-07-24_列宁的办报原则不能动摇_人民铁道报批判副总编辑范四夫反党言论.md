    Lenin's Principles of Running a Newspaper Cannot Be Shaken
    People's Railway News Criticizes Deputy Editor-in-Chief Fan Sifu's Anti-Party Remarks
    (Our report) On the 19th of this month, Ministry of Railways staff held a forum to refute the anti-Party fallacies of rightist element Fan Sifu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of People's Railway News.
    At the first capital city journalism work forum on May 16th, and during a lecture to the journalism class at the Ministry of Railways Cadre School on June 4th, Fan Sifu vigorously promoted bourgeois journalistic views, saying such things as, "In the construction period, Lenin's principles of running a newspaper greatly need research," "Official newspapers speak official language," "It only pours from top to bottom, it is not a mass public opinion organ," and that newspapers have a certain distance from their readers, and so on.
    Kang Zhaoqiang, Deputy Director of the Mass Work Department of People's Railway News, strongly denounced Fan Sifu's fallacies, which attempted to revise Lenin's proletarian principle of running a newspaper, namely that "a newspaper is a collective propagandist, a collective agitator, and a collective organizer," and to negate the newspaper as a tool of class struggle. He said: The newspaper is a tool for the Party to conduct political struggle against the enemy. As long as the Party still has the task of leading the people to struggle against the enemy and the task of struggling against nature, the newspaper must and can play its role as a collective propagandist, a collective agitator, and a collective organizer. Especially today, when foreign class enemies and domestic bourgeois rightists are doing everything possible to undermine our socialist construction and overthrow our socialist system, it is even more necessary for newspapers to stand on the proletarian position, defend proletarian interests, publicize the Party and government's policies, and organize and mobilize the masses to victoriously realize the guidelines, policies, and tasks put forward by the Party.
    Kang Zhaoqiang said: In the past, People's Railway News published some instructive documents closely related to the work and lives of the broad masses, which were necessary and welcomed by the readers. Fan Sifu's demand that newspapers publish opinions that contradict the instructions of the Party's leading organs is essentially to oppose the Party's guidelines and line, to oppose the Party's leadership over the newspaper, and to attempt to change the nature of the newspaper.
    Chen Yuhua, a student in the journalism class at the Ministry of Railways Cadre School, revealed that Fan had said: "The rule that Party newspapers cannot criticize the Party committee at the same level now seems outdated." This essentially means that newspapers can sing a different tune from the Party.

### 列宁的办报原则不能动摇  人民铁道报批判副总编辑范四夫反党言论

    列宁的办报原则不能动摇
    人民铁道报批判副总编辑范四夫反党言论
    本报讯　本月19日，铁道部工作人员举行座谈驳斥右派分子、人民铁道报副总编辑范四夫的反党谬论。
    范四夫在5月16日首都第一次新闻工作座谈会上，在6月4日铁道部干部学校新闻班讲课时，大肆鼓吹资产阶级的新闻观点，说什么
  “在建设时期列宁的办报原则大有研究的必要”，“机关报是官方的，说机关话”，“只是从上往下灌，不是群众舆论机关”，报纸和读者有一定的距离等等。
    人民铁道报群众工作部副主任康兆强痛斥了范四夫企图修改列宁的关于“报纸是集体的宣传者、集体的鼓动者、集体的组织者”的这一无产阶级办报原则和否定报纸是阶级斗争的工具的谬论。他说：报纸是党向敌人进行政治斗争的工具，只要党还有领导人民向敌人斗争的任务，有向大自然进行斗争的任务，报纸就必须而且能够发挥它的集体的宣传者、集体的鼓动者、集体的组织者的作用。尤其是在今天，国外的阶级敌人和国内资产阶级右派分子，千方百计地企图破坏我们的社会主义建设事业，推翻我们的社会主义制度，这就更需要报纸站在无产阶级立场，捍卫无产阶级利益，宣传党和政府的方针政策，组织并鼓动人民群众胜利地实现党所提出的方针政策和任务。
    康兆强说：人民铁道报在过去登了一些与广大群众的工作、生活有密切关系的指示文件，这些都是必要的，读者也是欢迎的。范四夫要报纸发表与党的领导机关指示相违背的言论，实质上就是要反对党的方针路线，就是要反对党对报纸的领导，企图改变报纸的性质。
    铁道部干部学校新闻班学员陈亚骅揭发范曾说：“党报不能批评同级党委的规定，现在看来是过时了”。这实质上是说报纸可以与党唱对台戏。
