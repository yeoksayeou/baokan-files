Zhang Sizhou Speaks:

    Warning Rightists Not to Daydream
    Our Peasants May Not Be Highly Educated, But Our Eyes Are Sharp
    I am a peasant representative from Sichuan Province, the director of the Mianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang County. After studying Chairman Mao's report and the several reports given by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Premier Bo at this conference, I firmly support them. I want to briefly report to the representatives about the living conditions of us peasants.
    Recently, rightists have been clamoring loudly, viciously attacking the Party and the government. Some of them say that collectivization is not working, it has been messed up, and the lives of the peasants have not improved. This is completely closing their eyes and talking nonsense, deliberately deceiving people, and secretly engaging in conspiracies to oppose our Party and oppose socialism. We resolutely oppose them.
    Before liberation, our peasants' lives were very hard. At that time, we had no land to cultivate, and we often worked as hired laborers to make a living, and even had to go out to carry poles. We often ate pumpkins and cowpea leaves, and we could not easily even eat sweet potatoes. Only during the New Year and holidays could we eat a meal of white rice. Some people even had to beg for food. In our cooperative, there is a man named Li Dongcai. In the past, he didn't even have pants, and he couldn't go out during the day. His wife often went out to beg for food. Since liberation, he has been allocated land in the land reform, and later joined the agricultural cooperative. They have food to eat now and no longer have to beg. Now they have sewn new clothes and have no worries about clothing. In the past, when peasants got married, they temporarily borrowed a cloth shirt to wear to the wedding ceremony. Now, cooperative members wear fine cloth clothes. Young women even wear floral clothes, and many people have wool hats, pens, rubber shoes, and flashlights. Our peasants' lives today have greatly improved. Culture is also improving. For example, I myself started working as a hired laborer at the age of eleven, working bitterly for the landlord for eighteen years. I didn't read any books at all. The landlord scolded me as a "black-eyed person." In 1953, when I went to Korea to comfort the volunteers, I couldn't even write my own name. Whenever I have free time, I ask people to teach me to read, learning one character and remembering it. Now, I can recognize more than two thousand characters, and I can read the People's Daily. This year, I am already reading junior high school first-year books myself. Thinking about myself, having food to eat, clothes to wear, and having learned culture, compared to the past, it is truly like being in heaven and hell.
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to divide the land and then led us onto the path of collectivization. We peasants will never forget this kindness. Since we had land and organized cooperatives, our peasants have been working even harder, going to the fields before dawn and finishing work after dark. Our Mianfeng cooperative has 939 mu of paddy fields and 4,019 mu of dry land. In the past, the soil was very poor, and production was not good. Since the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the members have come up with ways to change the land that used to grow one crop a season to growing two, three, or four crops a season. For example, if peas are planted in the field, spring potatoes are planted in the rows of peas. Once the peas are harvested, cotton is planted on the land where the peas were grown. When the original potatoes in the cotton rows are harvested and the cotton bursts into white flowers, autumn potatoes are planted again. This allows for four harvests, which is called "four harvests a year." This method has been identified by agricultural experts as "intercropping." Now we are still not satisfied. With the help of the leadership, we have already achieved five harvests a year for our grain crops. In the past, our paddy fields only grew one crop a season. Now, 42 percent of our paddy fields are planted with double-cropping rice. We are very enthusiastic about production. This is mainly for the sake of building socialism. In the past, when we worked for landlords and rich peasants, where would we have such enthusiasm? Now there is no exploitation by landlords and rich peasants. The more we work, the more we get. Who isn't happy? Who isn't happily taking the socialist road?
    Jianyang County is a cotton-producing area. Our cooperative has more than 2,000 mu of land planted with cotton. It was originally a cooperative mainly producing cash crops. When the cooperative was established in 1953, the government still had to supply grain. Since the implementation of the "intercropping" method, grain production has greatly increased, and the government no longer needs to supply grain. Both grain and cotton have bumper harvests, and it has become a surplus grain cooperative. In 1955, each person received an average of 420 jin of grain. In 1956, each person received an average of 491 jin. If there are no natural disasters this year, it is estimated that each person will receive 590 jin. In 1955, we also sold more than 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the government.
    Our Mianfeng Cooperative was established in 1953 with only 26 households. In 1956, it became an advanced cooperative with 520 households and 2,500 people. We have gone through some detours in building the cooperative. We had no experience, did not understand management, and had shortcomings and failures in our work. For example, we suffered a great loss in developing sideline production. In 1954 and 1955, we built large pigsties, but many pigs died from plague. We bought hundreds of ducks, but dozens were trampled to death. The fish fry we raised were washed away by the water. At that time, "killing the cows to death, smashing the horses to death, letting the fish run away, and trampling the ducks to death," the cooperative members were very dissatisfied with this situation, and I also made several self-criticisms, but we did not lose heart. Under the leadership, education, and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, we relied on everyone to come up with ways to overcome the difficulties, correct the shortcomings, and gain some experience. Now our management level has gradually improved, and we have a set of plans for managing production, achieving rational allocation of labor. This year, the cooperative has also carried out a large amount of basic construction, building five kilometers of roads, building thirty-three reservoirs, and digging forty-four large manure pits. There are six flour mills and six hundred mu of barren land covered with more than one inch of topsoil to improve the soil and ensure a bumper harvest this year. There are also department stores and four private schools. The cooperative has its own masons, carpenters, stonemasons, blacksmiths, and tailors. There are both Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, and cooperative members can receive medical treatment within the cooperative. The shirt I am wearing was sewn by our cooperative itself. In addition, we are also starting to build six large pig farms. There are now 424 publicly raised pigs in the cooperative, including 108 sows. It is expected that by the end of the year, the number will increase to more than 1,000. By next year, combined with the pigs raised privately by the cooperative members, there will be more than 3,000. We also have experience in pig raising hygiene. We have also built pig bathing pools and give the pigs a bath every ten days to ensure that the pigs do not get sick. Our fat pigs generally weigh more than 200 jin, and some weigh 300 jin. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, our cooperative slaughtered eighteen pigs and distributed them to the cooperative members to eat. We never had such good days before. In the past, only a few people, such as landlords and rich peasants, could afford to eat meat. In addition, we have also planted many pears, mandarin oranges, lemons, and honey peaches on the hillsides, turning the poor mountains into flower and fruit mountains. We have added forty-two water buffaloes, seventeen oxen, more than fifty sprayers, ten new-style walking plows, two radios, five carts, and one sewing machine. The average public accumulation per household is more than one hundred yuan.
    The above facts are all vivid. Our peasants' enthusiasm for building socialism is growing day by day. But there are also dissatisfied people in the cooperative who sing a different tune. Who are these people? They are some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. For example, last year during the New Year, they were dissatisfied with the government's regulation of one and a half jin of pork per person, and they also scolded, "Bullshit! What socialism, we can't even eat meat." Now the rightists oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the people's democratic dictatorship. In fact, they are speaking on behalf of the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. Our peasants may not be highly educated, but our eyes are sharp. We can clearly see what tricks the rightists are playing. When the peasants in our cooperative saw some of the words of the rightists published in the newspapers, it aroused great anger. Today, I want to tell the rightists that your daydream of seizing the people's power, conspiring to restore capitalism, and making us live a hard life again will not work. To be honest, you have miscalculated. We will never agree, and we will resolutely fight against you!

    张泗洲发言：
    警告右派分子不要妄想
    我们农民文化不高，可是眼睛亮得很
    我是四川省的农民代表，简阳县棉丰农业生产合作社社长。学习了毛主席的报告，周总理、李副总理、薄副总理等在这次大会的几个报告，我坚决拥护。我要在这里向代表们简单报告一下我们农民的生活情形。
    最近一向，右派分子在大叫大闹，恶毒地攻击党和政府。他们中间有些人说，合作化不行，搞糟了，农民生活没有改善。这完全是他们在闭起眼睛说瞎话，故意哄人、骗人，暗中搞阴谋活动来反对我们党，反对社会主义。我们坚决反对他们。
    在解放前，我们农民生活是很苦的。那时田地没有种的，常常帮工过日子，还要出去抬搰竿。我们经常吃的是南瓜、牛皮菜，红苕都不轻易吃到。逢年过节才能吃一顿白米饭。有的人还要讨口要饭。我们社里有个李栋才，过去他连裤子都没有，白天没法子出门，他的女人常常出去讨口。自从解放后，土地改革分得了土地，后来又加入了农业合作社，他们有饭吃了，再也不用去讨口了。如今都缝了新衣服，不愁穿了。过去农民结婚，都是临时向人借一件布衫穿起去拜堂，现在社员都穿上了细布衣服。年轻妇女还穿花衣服，好多人都有呢帽儿、钢笔、胶鞋、手电筒。我们农民今天的生活大大改善了。文化也在提高。比如我自己十一岁就开始做帮工，给地主苦做了十八年，书一点也没读过，地主骂我是“黑眼窝”。一九五三年，我到朝鲜去慰问志愿军，连我自己的名字都写不来。我自己一有空就请人教我认字，学一个记一个，到现在，我能认得两千多个字，人民日报我也会看了。今年我已在自己读初中一年级的书。想想我自己，有吃、有穿，又学了文化，跟过去来比，真是一个在天上，一个在地下。
    共产党毛主席领导我们分了田，又领导我们走上合作化的道路，这种恩情我们农民永远都不能忘记。自从有了土地，又组织了合作社，我们农民就干得更加起劲，天不见亮就下田，擦黑才收工。我们棉丰社有水田九百三十九亩，旱地四千零一十九亩，过去泥土很瘦，生产不好，自从组织了高级社，社员大家想办法，使过去种一季的，变成种两季、三季、四季。比如地里种了菀豆，就在菀豆行中种上春洋芋，菀豆一收，就在种过菀豆的地上种上棉花，棉花行中间原有的洋芋收了，棉花爆出白花的时候，又再种上秋洋芋。这就能够收四次，叫做“一年四熟”。这个办法经农业专家给我们鉴定，叫做“穿林套种”。现在我们还不满足，在领导的帮助下，我们的粮食作物已经做到了一年五熟。我们的水田过去只种一季，现在百分之四十二的水田种上了双季稻。我们的生产劲头大得很，这主要是为着建设社会主义，过去给地主富农帮工那有这样的劲头？现在没有地主富农剥削，多劳动就能多得，那一个不高兴？那一个不是欢欢喜喜走社会主义道路？
    简阳县是产棉区。我们社里有二千多亩地种棉花。本来是以生产经济作物为主的社，一九五三年建社开始的时候，还要政府供应粮食，自从搞“穿林套种”这个办法以后，粮食就大大增加了，再不要政府供应粮食了，粮棉都丰收，变成了余粮社。一九五五年，每人平均分到粮食四百二十斤，一九五六年，每人平均能分四百九十一斤，今年如果不发生自然灾害，预计每人可分到五百九十斤。一九五五年，还多卖余粮给政府十多万斤粮食。
    我们棉丰社在一九五三年建立起来的时候，只有二十六户，一九五六年建成高级社，有五百二十户，二千五百人。我们建社是走过一些弯路的。没有经验，不懂管理，工作中有过缺点，也失败过。比如搞副业，我们就吃过大亏。一九五四年、一九五五年我们修过大猪圈，瘟死了很多猪，买了几百只鸭子，踩死了几十只，养的鱼苗被水冲掉了。当时，“打死牛来摔死马，放跑鱼儿踩死鸭”，社员对这种情况很不满意，我也作过几次检讨，但我们并没有灰心。在党和人民政府的领导、教育帮助下，靠大家想办法，克服了困难，纠正了缺点，摸出了一些经验，现在我们的管理水平逐渐提高了，有了一套管理生产的计划，做到合理调配劳动力。今年社里还进行了大量基本建设，修了公路五公里，修了三十三个蓄水池，挖了四十四个大粪坑，有粉房六座，又把六百亩瘦土，挑上一寸多厚土来盖上，使土壤变好，保证今年丰收。还有百货商店，四个民办小学。社内泥工、木工、石工、铁匠、裁缝都有。有中医、有西医，社员有病都能在社内就医。我穿这件衬衫，就是我们社里自己缝制的。另外，我们正在着手修建六个大养猪场，社内公养的猪现在有四百二十四头，其中母猪一百零八头，预计到年底要发展到一千多头，到明年再和社员私养的猪加起来，就有三千多头。对养猪卫生工作也有经验了，我们还修建了猪的洗澡池，十多天就给猪洗一次澡，保证猪不生病。我们的肥猪一般是二百多斤，也有三百斤重的。今年过端阳节，我们社里杀了十八条猪，分给社员吃。先前那有这样的好日子，过去只是地主富农等少数人吃得起肉。另外，我们在山坡上还种了很多梨子、温州蜜橘、柠檬、水蜜桃，把穷山变成花果山。添上水牛四十二只、黄牛十七只、喷雾器五十多部、新式步犁十部、收音机二部、架子车五部、缝纫机一部。公共积累每户平均一百多元。
    以上这些事实都是活生生的，我们农民建设社会主义的劲头是一天比一天更大更高。但是社里也有不满意的，唱反腔的，这是那些人呢？就是一些地主、富农、反革命分子。比如去年过年时，他们对政府规定每人一斤半猪肉就不满，还骂：“屁！什么社会主义，肉都吃不到。”现在右派分子反对党，反对社会主义，反对人民民主专政，实际他们就是代表地主、富农、反革命分子在说话。我们农民文化还不高，可是眼睛亮得很。我们看得清楚右派分子在耍啥子把戏。我们社里农民看到报上登的右派分子的一些话，引起了很大的愤怒。我今天要告诉右派分子，你们妄想夺取人民的政权，阴谋恢复资本主义，使我们再过苦日子，那不行，老实说，你们的算盘打错了，我们决不会答应的，我们要坚决同你们斗争！
