How to Identify Leather?

When you buy leather products, can you identify cowhide, horsehide, and pigskin? Here, we will briefly introduce the characteristics of these leathers to you:

Cowhide: The pores on the leather surface are small and round, and evenly distributed. The leather fiber layers are arranged in parallel, the fiber structure is slender and tight, with high tensile strength and strong toughness.

Horsehide: The pores on the leather surface are relatively large, in the shape of inclined ellipses, and unevenly distributed. Upon close inspection of the leather surface, fine scale-like cortex is attached. The leather fiber layers are arranged in parallel, but the fiber structure is loose everywhere except for the buttocks, less wear-resistant than cowhide, and has less tensile strength.

Pigskin: The pores are coarse and large, with three clustered together forming natural patterns, and the pores penetrate the leather layer. The leather fiber structure is short and fine, about one-tenth that of cowhide. The fiber structure is tighter than cowhide, and the tensile strength and tanning toughness are inferior to cowhide, but the wear resistance is higher than cowhide, and the water resistance is greater. ·Liang Xianwen·

    如何识别皮革？
    当你买皮革制品的时候，你能识别牛革、马革和猪革吗？这里，我们把这几种皮革的特点向大家简单介绍一下：
    牛皮革：革面毛孔细小，呈圆形，分布均匀。皮层纤维平行排列，纤维组织细长紧密，抗张力大，韧性强。
    马皮革：革面毛孔较大，呈倾斜椭圆形，分布的不均匀。仔细察看皮面，附有细鳞状皮质。皮层纤维平行排列，纤维组织除臀部外都很松弛，不如牛皮革耐磨，抗张力较小。
    猪皮革：毛孔粗大，三个一撮成为自然花纹，毛眼透过皮层。皮层纤维组织细短，约为牛皮的十分之一，纤维组织比牛皮紧密，抗张力、鞣韧性次于牛皮，但耐磨力比牛皮高，耐水性大。  ·梁贤文·
