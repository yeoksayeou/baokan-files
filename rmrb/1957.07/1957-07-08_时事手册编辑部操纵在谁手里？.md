Who is manipulating the Editorial Department of "Current Affairs Handbook"?
    Fen Ruo
    As a reader who loves the "Current Affairs Handbook," I cannot help but expose the heinous conspiracy of the editorial department of the "Current Affairs Handbook" to篡改 (falsify/tamper with) the political direction of the "Current Affairs Handbook."
    Issue No. 10 of the "Current Affairs Handbook" (published on May 21, 1957) had already revealed signs of this conspiracy to篡改. In the article "Shanghai in the Great Blooming and Great Contending" written by the editor Liang Ming, some vicious right-wing remarks were recommended to readers by means of smuggling and drug trafficking. He used the mouths of right-wing elements to slander the ideological remolding movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, believing that the "estrangement" between the Party and intellectuals came from the side effects of "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" and "ideological remolding." He quoted the nonsense of right-wing elements: "In the past, people were not afraid of officials, but only of those in charge; now they are not afraid of those in charge, but only of 'officials'," and inserted the subtitle "Throw the bureaucratic airs into the latrine" before it.
    Issue No. 11 of the "Current Affairs Handbook" (published on June 6) even more blatantly demonstrated the anti-Party and anti-socialist political direction of the editorial department of the journal. It published a so-called comprehensive report on the rectification movement under the name of "Data Room of this Journal," entitled "Gentle Breeze and Mild Rain, Great Blooming and Great Contending." This report first slandered that China's ideological circles only "began to enter the season of spring" after the Party Central Committee put forward the方針 (policy) of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" last July, "but after all, it was still early spring at that time, and it was still a bit chilly. Everything was just beginning to awaken from the ice and snow," and it was not until the recent one or two months that "bright and beautiful sunny weather" appeared. This undoubtedly means that in the seven years since liberation, the Party's leadership has become a severe rule over ideological circles, and only when the right-wing elements launched a狂猖 (frenzied) attack on the Party did it truly have spring. This report then mixed the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements with some well-intentioned criticisms, and spread a large number of reactionary remarks by 章乃器 (Zhang Naiqi), 罗隆基 (Luo Longji), 黄绍竑 (Huang Shaohong), 林汉达 (Lin Handa), 鲁莽 (Lu Mang), 李康年 (Li Kangnian), etc., and added such subtitles as: "Filling the ditches and demolishing the walls, intellectuals吐出肺腑之言 (speak their minds) to the Party," "Democratic人士 (personages) talk freely about 'coexistence' and 'supervision'," "Removing concerns, business and industry begin to诉说衷肠 (pour out their hearts)," beautifying the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements.
    The eleventh issue also published such a vicious essay, entitled "Stewed Pig's Trotters over a Slow Fire." It compared some of the Party's mistakes and shortcomings to "pig's trotters with thick skin, many tendons, and hard bones." The author even called this slanderous metaphor a "妙喻 (brilliant metaphor)."
    The "Current Affairs Handbook" has nearly one million subscribers. It is a journal with a long history and prestige among the broad masses, which publicizes the Party's current affairs policies. However, when the right-wing elements launched a狂猖 (frenzied) attack on the Party, the political direction of the journal was篡改 (falsified/tampered with) by the editorial department. I have to raise the following questions:
    (1) Where exactly does the editorial department of this journal want to guide this journal to? What kind of unspeakable purpose does it have?
    (2) Why does the editorial department of this journal dare to regard millions of readers as a free market for them to spread poison? Is this editorial department really composed of demons and monsters?
    (3) Although the journal has not seen articles as smoky as those in the tenth and eleventh issues since the twelfth issue, why hasn't it explained the truth about篡改 (falsifying/tampering with) the political direction to the readers until now? Does it want to gloss over it?
    I think this is not only a question that I want to raise, but also a question that millions of readers want to raise. We will never allow the editorial department of the journal to turn this serious journal, which publicizes domestic and foreign current affairs and the policies of the Party and the state, into the private property of a few right-wing elements. We will never allow them to regard our millions of readers as ignorant and欺愚 (easily deceived) "阿斗 (idiots)." We will never allow them to steal the day and change the day to篡改 (falsify/tamper with) the socialist direction of the journal. We will never allow them to vaguely gloss over their vicious conspiracy without explanation! I hope that if there are editorial workers in the journal who support the leadership of the Party and socialism, they will publicly tell the readers the truth; and make a public criticism in the journal.

    时事手册编辑部操纵在谁手里？
    奋若
    作为热爱“时事手册”的一个读者，我不能不揭发“时事手册”编辑部篡改“时事手册”的政治方向的罪恶阴谋。
    “时事手册”第10期（1957年5月21日出版），已经露出这种篡改阴谋的苗头。编者梁明所写的“上海在大放大鸣中”一稿中，就把一些恶毒的右派言论，采取走私贩毒的手法在向读者推荐。他借右派分子的嘴，诬蔑思想改造运动和肃反运动，认为党与知识分子的“隔阂”，是来自“肃反”、“思想改造”的副作用。他引用了右派分子的谰言：“过去不怕官，只怕管；现在是不怕管，只怕‘官’”“有些知识分子有谈‘官’色变之感”，并且在前面插上了“把官架子丢进茅坑里”的小标题。
    “时事手册”第11期（6月6日出版），就更加露骨地表现了该刊编辑部的反党反社会主义的政治方向。用“本刊资料室”名义发表了“春风化雨，大放大鸣”一篇关于整风运动的所谓综合报道。这篇报道首先诬蔑我国思想界只是在去年7月党中央提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针后，“才开始进入了春天的季节”，“但是，当时毕竟还是早春天气，所谓春寒料峭，万物才刚刚由冰冻中苏醒过来”，而直到最近一两个月以来，才出现了“明媚的艳阳天气。”这无疑是说，解放以来的七年，党的领导成为对思想界的严酷统治，直到右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候起，才真正有了春天。这篇报道接着把右派分子的反动言论和一些善意的批评夹杂在一起，大量地散布了章乃器、罗隆基、黄绍竑、林汉达、鲁莽、李康年等等的反动言论，并且分别加上这样一些小标题：“填沟拆墙，知识分子对党吐出肺腑之言”、“民主人士畅谈‘共存’和‘监督’”、“解除顾虑，工商界开始诉说衷肠”，把右派分子反动言论加以美化。
    第十一期还登载了这样恶毒的小品文，题目叫做“文火炖猪蹄”。把党的一些错误和缺点，比喻为“猪蹄皮厚筋多骨硬”。作者并且把这样污蔑性的比喻，称之为“妙喻”。
    “时事手册”的订户数近一百万，是一个有着长久历史的，在广大群众中有威信的，宣传党的时事政策的刊物。但是在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，竟被该刊的编辑部篡改了它的政治方向。我不得不提出这样的质问：
    （一）这个刊物的编辑部究竟想把这个刊物引导向那里去？有着怎样不可告人的目的？
    （二）这个刊物的编辑部为什么胆敢把千百万的读者，看成是他们散布毒素的自由市场？这个编辑部究竟是不是由牛鬼蛇神组成的？
      （三）这个刊物虽然从第十二期起已看不到像第十、十一期那样的乌烟瘴气的文章，但是为什么直到现在没有把一度篡改了政治方向的真相，向读者作出交代？是否想含混过去？
    我想，这不仅是我一个人要提出的质问，恐怕是成百万读者都要提出的质问。我们决不允许该刊编辑部把这样宣传国内外时事、宣传党和国家政策的严肃的刊物，变成少数右派分子的私有财产，决不允许他们把我们千百万读者看成一无知识、可以欺愚的“阿斗”，决不允许他们偷天换日地篡改这个刊物的社会主义方向，决不允许他们对于自己的恶毒阴谋，含糊了事，不作交代！希望该刊如有拥护党的领导、拥护社会主义的编辑工作者，把其中真相公开告诉读者；并且在该刊作出公开批判。
