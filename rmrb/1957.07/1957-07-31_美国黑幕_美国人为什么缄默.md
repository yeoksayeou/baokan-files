American Inside Story

Why are Americans Silent?

Not long ago, Hans Lye, a reporter for the American "Patriot's Report," intended to write some articles reflecting public opinion. To this end, he visited two thousand residents in Pennsylvania, but the residents remained silent on the questions he raised, especially when it came to talking about "Russia" and "Communism."

In the American magazine "Editor & Publisher," Lye wrote about his failure: "After I bothered about two thousand residents, I came to some conclusions that can be fully applied to the national scope. The fact is this: people dare not speak their minds... people are worried that if their words are quoted, it will bring adverse consequences." According to Lye, the reason people remain silent is fear of "investigation."

    美国黑幕
    美国人为什么缄默
    不久以前，美国“爱国志士报”记者汉思·赖伊特打算写一些反映社会舆论的文章。为此他在宾夕法尼亚州先后访问了二千居民，但居民们却对他提出的问题缄口不答，特别是谈到“俄国”和“共产主义”的时候。
    赖伊特在美国杂志“编者与出版者”上对他这次的失败写道：“在我打扰了大概二千居民后，我得出了一些结论，这些结论是完全可以引用到全国范围去的。事实就是这样：人们不敢把心中的话讲出来……人们担心他们的话被引用后，会带来不利的后果。”照赖伊特所说，人们保持沉默的原因是害怕“调查”。
