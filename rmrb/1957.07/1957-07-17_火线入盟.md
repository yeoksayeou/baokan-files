    "Joining the League on the Front Line"
    Dong Dai
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, there were many moving and heroic deeds of joining the Party on the front lines. They were tempered in the struggle against the enemy, their class consciousness was raised, they withstood the test of war, and they were willing to dedicate their lives to the great Party. Therefore, joining the Party on the front line is itself a kind of test, a kind of tempering.

    In recent months, it has truly been an extraordinary period, and in this extraordinary period, another kind of "joining the Party on the front line" and "joining the League on the front line" has emerged. The right-wing elements with ulterior motives have taken advantage of this extraordinary period to provoke a fierce class struggle. They attempted to ignite fires on all fronts, and they wanted to find their partners on these burning fronts to expand the influence of their reactionary, anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist "front."

    Chen Renbing, an expert in setting fires, was the "inventor" of "joining the League on the front line." He set a wildfire in the Shanghai Film Studio, which indeed constituted a very intense "front line" of struggle, and he personally supervised the battle, holding five forums to fan the flames. He made preparations before the meetings and blamed the Shanghai Film Studio's China Democratic League branch for being "weak and incompetent" and lacking "combativeness." He also questioned how only seven League members in such a large factory could be useful or handle important matters. He wanted to develop the League on a large scale, and he had a "line" for doing so, not just developing it randomly. He was looking for people who had always been dissatisfied with the Party, who had emotions, grievances, historical baggage, etc., but he also wanted to give these people a "test," a "joining the League on the front line." The five forums were a front-line battle, and he found people who met his requirements. At the meetings, he did his best to incite the flames, and as a result, this "front line" was filled with "slander and abuse of the Party and compliments and praises of the China Democratic League." This fire-setting expert, Chen Renbing, selected his targets from this "front line." In the process of the five forums, the number of League members increased from seven to thirty-three, a fourfold increase in less than a month, and these people were called the people who "joined the League on the front line."

    This "front line" was very long. Wherever the right-wing elements set fires, the line was drawn there, and a set of "joining the League on the front line" tricks was performed there, because this was an important measure in the large-scale development line of the right-wing group, Zhang Bojun. For example, Li Huifang of the China Peking Opera Theater pointed out that "the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is setting fires in the Peking Opera circle on one hand, and taking advantage of the opportunity to develop party members on a large scale on the other," and that "there were even actors who filled out forms, submitted applications on June 12, and were approved on June 13."

    In the eyes of the right-wing elements, this was a great opportunity, a truly extraordinary time, a time of "darkness and chaos," a time when "opportunities could be seized," a time when "much could be accomplished." So they launched a "large-scale development" and, while setting fires everywhere, launched a "joining the League on the front line," a "joining the Party on the front line," to "temper" these elements who had taken the bait, so that they would throw themselves into the "front line" and set fires everywhere, so as to use the elements who "joined the League on the front line" as political blackmail capital to create a false impression of strength.

    These people, blinded by greed, had their heads clouded by subjective desires. They really seemed to be about to win in this fierce class struggle, and it really seemed that their dream of capitalist restoration could be realized. In fact, what they held in their hands was just a Don Quixote's lance that had long been broken, which could not withstand the giant windmills of the people's era.

    “火线入盟”
    董代
    在抗日战争期间，在解放战争期间，曾经有过不少可歌可泣的火线入党的英雄事迹。他们在对敌斗争中受到锻炼，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，经受了战火的考验，而愿意把自己的生命献给伟大的党。因此，火线入党的本身就是一种考验，一种锻炼。
    最近这几个月的时间中，真是一段不平常的时间，也就在这一段不平常的时间中出现了另一种“火线入党”和“火线入盟”。别有用心的右派分子就是利用了这一段不平常的时间，挑起了一场激烈的阶级斗争，他们企图在各个战线上点起火来，他们就想在这些烧起火来的战线上找到他的伙伴，为他们的反动的反党反人民反社会主义的“阵线”扩张势力。
    放火专家陈仁炳就是一个“火线入盟”的“发明人”。他在上海电影制片厂放了一把野火，的确是构成了一条斗争非常激烈的“火线”，而且他亲自督战，召开五次烧火的座谈会。他在会前就做了一番准备工作，并且责备了上影民盟支部“软弱无能”，“斗争性”不强，而且在这样一个大厂中只有七个盟员，怎么能派用场，任大事呢？他要大发展也有“路线”的，不是随便发展的。他要找的是一贯对党不满，有情绪的，有牢骚的，有历史包袱的……等等，但是他还要对这些人来一次“考验”，来一个“火线入盟”。五次座谈就是一场火线战斗，他找来的是符合他的要求的人，在会上极尽煽火的能事，于是在这条“火线”上就充满了“对党的诽谤谩骂和对民盟的恭维歌颂”。这个放火专家陈仁炳就从这条“火线”上挑选起对象来，在五次座谈会的过程中，从七名盟员发展到三十三名盟员，不到一个月的时间增加了四倍，而这些人就称之为“火线入盟”的人了。
    这条“火线”很长，右派分子的火放到那里，线就拉到那里，那里就来了一套“火线入盟”的把戏，因为这是右派集团章伯钧的大发展路线中的一项重要措施。比如中国京剧院李慧芳就指出“农工民主党一面在京剧界放火，一面利用时机大量发展党员”，而且“居然就有演员填了表，6月12日提出申请，6月13日就批准”了。
    在右派分子看来，这是大好机会，真是不平常的时候，真是来了个“昏天黑地”了，“有机可乘”了，“大有可为”了；于是就来个“大发展”，而且要在到处放火的同时，来个“火线入盟”，来个“火线入党”，用以“锻炼”一下这些被诱饵上钩的分子，以便使他们投入“火线”，到处放起火来；以便利用“火线入盟”的分子，当做政治讹诈的资本，虚张声势。
    这些利令智昏的人被主观愿望冲昏了头脑，真好像他们就要在这场激烈的阶级斗争中取得胜利了，真好像他们的资本主义复辟的美梦就可以实现了。其实，在他们手里握着的不过是一支唐·吉诃德的早已折损了的长枪，那里抵挡得住人民时代的巨大的风车。
