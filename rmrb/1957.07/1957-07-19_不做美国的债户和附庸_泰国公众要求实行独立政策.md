Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 18th: Nai Thavi Visetthapari, the new leader of the Hyde Park Movement Party and a member of parliament, said at a mass rally in Bangkok on the 14th that the result of American "aid" to Thailand has caused Thailand to lose its independence and become a debtor of the United States.

Nai Thavi also cited facts to point out that various American institutions in Thailand control Thailand's military, economic, political, and police departments.

Nai Ampol Suwanvanbutr, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, told the press on the 13th that American "aid" and interference in Thailand is a matter very worthy of study. He pointed out that the "American Military Advisory Group" comprehensively controls Thailand's military forces, which has brought losses to Thailand.

Thai writer Nai Kura Sibarit published an article in the "Freedom Communications" on the 14th, calling on the Thai government to implement an independent foreign policy in accordance with the people's demands, withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, abolish the military agreements signed with the United States, develop friendly relations with all countries, and follow the principles of peaceful coexistence.

    不做美国的债户和附庸
    泰国公众要求实行独立政策
    据新华社18日讯  曼谷消息：新任泰国海德公园运动党领袖、议员乃他威塞·蒂帕里14日在曼谷的一个群众集会上说，美国对泰国“援助”的结果，使泰国丧失了独立，并且成为美国的债户。
    乃他威塞还列举事实指出，美国驻泰国的各种机构控制了泰国的军事、经济、政治和警察等部门。
    自由民主党副领袖乃安蓬·素旺那汶13日向报界发表谈话说，美国对泰国的“援助”和干涉，是一件非常值得研究的事。他指出，“美国军事顾问团”全面控制泰国的军事力量，给泰国带来了损失。
    泰国著名作家乃古腊·柿巴立在14日的“自由通讯报”上发表文章，呼吁泰国政府按照人民的要求实行独立的外交政策，退出东南亚条约组织和废除同美国签订的军事协定，发展同所有国家的友好关系，遵循和平共处的原则。
