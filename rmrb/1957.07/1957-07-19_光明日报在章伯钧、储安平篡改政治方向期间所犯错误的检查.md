Self-Examination of Guangming Daily Regarding Errors Made During the Period When Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping Tampered with the Political Direction
Guangming Daily Editorial Department
While denouncing the crimes of bourgeois rightists Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping in tampering with the political direction of this newspaper, we have conducted a self-examination of the editorial department's work. As criticized by the People's Daily editorial department in its article "Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Orientation for a Time" on June 14, during the short period when Chu Anping actually controlled the editorial operations, namely from May to early June, the basic political direction of this newspaper became that of a bourgeois newspaper.

Chu Anping took office on April 1. For the first three weeks, he was "understanding the situation" in the editorial department. On April 19, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee invited leaders of various democratic parties and non-party democrats to consult and decided that Guangming Daily would be run entirely independently by the democratic parties, and the Party group would be abolished. From this time on, Chu Anping began to actually control the editorial operations and, according to the political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance, used the slogan of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and the Communist Party's rectification movement to publish a large number of articles expressing bourgeois views without intending to criticize them, as well as inflammatory reports. Guangming Daily, a democratic party newspaper that had resolutely stood under the banner of socialism and wholeheartedly accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for eight years, was thus seized by bourgeois rightists as a tool for anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist propaganda.

We cannot help but angrily accuse Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping of the crime of pulling our newspaper off the socialist track and using it as their tool for anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism.

The Zhang-Luo alliance's attempt to tamper with the political direction of this newspaper, echoing Wenhui Daily, and engaging in inflammatory agitation for their political conspiracy, had been planned for a long time. After the Party proposed the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Zhang Bojun showed extraordinary concern for this newspaper. Zhang Bojun had already engaged in some activities last summer. After Chu Anping took office as editor-in-chief, Zhang Bojun became unprecedentedly "active" in the work of the newspaper. He came to the newspaper several times and conspired with Chu Anping. Chu Anping also repeatedly said that Chairman Zhang had instructions on this and opinions on that. Chu Anping also frequently reported his work to Zhang Bojun through letters, phone calls, and face-to-face meetings. The connection between them was very close. However, the highest management organ of the newspaper, the Board of Directors, was completely bypassed, and no meeting was held before Chu Anping's resignation.

According to the materials that have been revealed, Zhang Bojun made the following suggestions: First, he believed that this newspaper took the lead in horizontal typesetting in the past, and now it can take the lead in vertical typesetting. This was part of his activities against the reform of the written language. Second, he wanted the newspaper to report more on the activities of the leaders of the democratic parties. In essence, he wanted us to promote him and elevate his status as capital for his political conspiracy. Third, he advocated publishing more news from capitalist countries' news agencies and reflecting more on the activities of socialist parties in capitalist countries. Chu Anping strongly supported these opinions. In mid-May, Zhang Bojun specifically came to the newspaper to inform Chu Anping that such excitement would continue for another year and a half, advocating to quickly stop all special issues to free up space for anti-Party propaganda. On the eve of the publication of the People's Daily editorial "Why Is This?", he called Chu Anping, saying that Zhang Naiqi criticized Guangming Daily for "收" ("retracting"), thus encouraging Chu Anping's anti-Party propaganda. As for further controlling this newspaper as a propaganda tool for the Zhang-Luo alliance, Zhang Bojun recently admitted that the entire reorganization of Guangming Daily would have to wait until the situation was clarified. It can be seen that they had a grand plan.

In order to tamper with the political direction of this newspaper, Chu Anping carried out many activities after coming to the newspaper. First, he promoted the Zhang-Luo alliance's ideas on running a newspaper. He believed that today's newspapers should turn back to learn from the old newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before liberation, and learn from Wenhui Daily. He denied that newspapers have a guiding and promoting role. He completely negated the editorials published by our newspaper in the past eight years, believing that those editorials were either singing praises or dogmatic. He advocated that if we were to write editorials, we should write so-called "critical" editorials that played a "supervisory" role. And he believed that such editorials were difficult to write because this newspaper was jointly sponsored by various democratic parties, and there were too many "mothers-in-law." Therefore, in such an important period in our country's political life, regarding the Party's rectification and major domestic issues, apart from publishing a severely erroneous editorial on May 4, he not only did not organize editorials, but also picked on and refused to publish the already written editorial on the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League. In news reporting, his policy was actually the eight characters: "Only expose, obliterate achievements." He once openly said: "Our task is to expose, and solving the problems is the Communist Party's business." He advocated that as long as it is a fact, any news can be published. He liked to grab news, liked "exclusive news," liked inside news. He wanted our editors and reporters not to be afraid of causing trouble. He said that there is a fundamental contradiction between newspapers and the Communist Party and the People's Government, that is, some news that newspapers want to publish, the Party and the government do not want to publish. He advocated using news from imperialist countries' news agencies in international reporting, and directly adopting it without analysis. He also wanted to report more on the activities of socialist parties in capitalist countries. He said that the current international news arrangements in various newspapers are not very good and are not suitable for the tastes of intellectuals, and he took Fei Xiaotong's opinion as representative. Among the cadres, Chu Anping also used various faces and means in the name of "understanding the situation" and "following the mass line" to peddle his bourgeois newspaper-running line and probe the bottom of the editorial department. During this period, Chu Anping not only wanted to see the proofs of what he considered important manuscripts, but also personally solicited or handled some manuscripts; for important interviews, he deliberately got rid of the director of the general editorial office or the responsible Party member comrades of the department and personally directed them.

During this period, due to Chu Anping's implementation of the political conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance, our newspaper attacked the Party's leadership over cultural and educational undertakings; distorted the Party's policies, provoked the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and spread dissatisfaction with the Party; advocated absolute democracy and individual freedom; incited college students to make trouble; distorted the Party's policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with democratic parties; exaggerated the contradictions among the people, negated achievements, and painted the new China as a dark picture; and promoted bourgeois journalistic views and styles. In terms of editing methods, it deliberately rendered and strengthened the negative propaganda effects.

During this period, many of the working comrades in the editorial department also made quite serious mistakes in their interviewing and editing work. We are now seriously and conscientiously conducting a self-examination of these mistakes.

We thank the Party for issuing a timely warning to us, instructing us to wake up from our mistakes, and to launch a struggle against the bourgeois rightists together with the people of the whole country, and to turn our newspaper back to the revolutionary socialist road.

We thank the vast number of readers for their timely criticisms. We have received a large number of letters from readers pointing out many errors in the propaganda. Many readers have also come to the newspaper to offer their opinions in person. Some readers came to the newspaper to reason with Chu Anping. The readers' criticisms have been of great help to our work of self-examination, and we sincerely accept them and express our gratitude here, and will no longer reply to them separately.

The Nine-City Symposium with Fires Everywhere

Chu Anping's first step in taking charge of the business was to send reporters to hold symposiums in nine major cities, setting fires everywhere and disrupting the rectification steps. He incited the people to be dissatisfied with the Party and painted a dark picture of the new China, which was vigorously building a socialist society, in an attempt to achieve the purpose of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism.

The nine-city symposium was a large-scale conspiracy activity personally directed by Chu Anping. With the support of Zhang Bojun, he made arrangements without contacting the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee or asking for instructions from the central committees of the democratic parties. Before the reporters set off, Chu Anping gave them instructions, instructing them to find representative people who had always had grievances and dared to speak to participate in the symposium. One reporter once asked Chu for instructions, what if some people were representative but had "nothing to complain about," and what if some people "dared to complain" but had no representativeness? Chu Anping definitely instructed to invite the latter. This fully shows that he was trying to use those who were dissatisfied and use the backward side of intellectuals to be the vanguard of the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy. Chu Anping was also afraid that these people would have "concerns," so he asked reporters to visit them separately before inviting them, instigating these people to speak out freely. Completely abandoning the local CPC committees, he only asked reporters to contact local organizations of the democratic parties. In some places, Chu Anping also personally wrote letters to directly contact local rightists, or specified that reporters should find those rightists and ask them to speak out on certain issues. For example, Wang Hengshou of Fudan University was the first rightist in Shanghai to propose abolishing the responsibility system of the CPC committees in universities and advocated the so-called "professor governance of the school." Chu Anping instructed the Shanghai-based reporter to be sure to invite Wang Hengshou to participate in the symposium (note: the Shanghai-based reporter did not accept this instruction). This arrangement was obviously to concentrate forces to attack the Party and the government.

From the beginning of May, in just one month, there were eleven symposium records reported in the newspaper, occupying twelve full pages, with about 130,000 words. In addition to the symposium records, the reporters who organized the symposiums also sent nearly twenty special telegrams and wrote more than a dozen newsletters, until the Qingdao symposium record reported on June 5 was over. During this period, our newspaper provided a forum for bourgeois rightists, issued a large number of absurd remarks, and carried out vicious attacks on the Party, causing extremely bad effects in various places.

From the perspective of our editorial staff, many problems were also exposed in the reporting work of these symposiums.

The organization and reporting of the symposiums varied from place to place. The worst was Shenyang. Wang Shaotong, the second director of the Party Department of this newspaper who presided over this work, even adopted the method of "generalizing" to the secretary of the CPC Provincial Committee, raising difficult problems with an antagonistic attitude, such as "There is a historical reason why this place cannot speak out. What is your opinion?" and so on. Another reporter, Yin Yi, also wrote a newsletter entitled "The First Winter Jasmine" that promoted "spontaneous speaking out." For example, in Wuhan, there was a symposium. How to convene this meeting and who to invite to participate were discussed with the rightist Ma Zhemin. Our reporters also held three consecutive symposiums there. Pan Wenbin, director of the School Education Department who presided over this work, also said: "This time to Wuhan is Chu Anping's first personal arrangement of work, so we must do it well!" Pan Wenbin also wrote two newsletters: "Wuhan Letters" and "Feeling Lonely Everywhere, Neighbors Like Strangers," emphasizing the so-called "spring breeze does not pass the Wusheng Pass" and the abnormal relationship between the Party and intellectuals. After the Guangzhou symposium was held, the reporter who presided over the work even had a feeling of "dissatisfaction," believing that the discussion was not "sharp" enough! Under Chu Anping's so-called instruction of "relying on the democratic parties," the Xi'an and Lanzhou symposiums were almost manipulated by the rightists. The Qingdao symposium was actively requested by reporter Zhong Guanggui (Chu Anping originally had this plan). This symposium was presided over by the rightist Xu Yiguan, and he was allowed to manipulate it, inviting more rightists to participate. Zhong Guanggui also extensively excerpted Xu Yiguan's reactionary and inflammatory speech in the "special news" reporting the symposium. The reporter who presided over the Nanjing symposium claimed that there was not enough time and refused to show the record to the United Front Work Department of the CPC committee. In short, according to Chu Anping's instructions, it was necessary to abandon the Party to "help the Party's rectification." Only the Shanghai symposium played a coordinating role in the speaking out led by the local Party committee.

According to Chu Anping's instructions, reporters sent to various places sent back special telegrams as soon as they got off the bus: there was no movement here, and there was no speaking out there. On May 3, two news items were published: "The Intellectual Circles in Wuhan Are Not Raining After a Long Drought" and "The Cultural and Educational Circles in Shandong Believe That the Leadership's Support for Speaking Out Is Not Enough." On May 5, "The Atmosphere of Speaking Out Is Thin in the Cultural and Educational Departments in Shenyang." On May 6, "Some Universities in Xi'an Have Not Implemented the Spirit of Speaking Out." On May 8, "The Atmosphere of Speaking Out Is Not Very Strong in Nanjing." The overall message of these consecutive special telegrams was one sentence: The Party is not letting go, and we want them to let go. The news of the symposium was also sent back by special telegram on the same day, and the content of the special telegram concentrated and prominently excerpted the most inflammatory so-called "catchphrases" emphasizing "spring cold," "spring late," and "deep ditches and high walls"; or exaggerated them in the reporter's own tone; or used the so-called "some people say" to render the "resonance" points between the reporter and the speaker. For example, the Shenyang special telegram on May 11 stated: "Some Party members should also correct the idea of 'I am the best in the world' and the arrogant 'standing out from the crowd' air." The Wuhan special telegram on May 10 stated: "Everyone believes...even ordinary Party members regard themselves as rulers and transformers, and regard non-Party intellectuals as ruled and transformed, to the extent that an insurmountable gap has been dug between the Party and the masses..." However, our examination of the transcripts of the Wuhan symposium this time did not find the words "ruler, ruled." This is even more unfounded. For example, the Nanjing special telegram on May 15 stated: "Everyone believes that Nanjing is still in early spring, and some people believe that the grassroots are still blocked by severe cold." The titles of the symposium news were even more described the relationship between the Party and the masses as a mess with inflammatory words such as "pushing down walls and filling ditches," "bombarding the situation," and "full of worries." When arranging the symposium records, the worst words of each speaker were also concentrated and concisely compiled into black-character subtitles, doing everything possible to provoke and incite. For example, the Xi'an symposium record published on May 11 had the subtitle "Three Big Tigers Become Three Big Demons" (note: referring to subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy); the Wuhan symposium record published on May 17 had the subtitle: "There is a Copper Wall and Iron Wall Between the Party and the Masses at Wuhan University, Which Was Built by the Privileged Class Style of Some Party Members..."; the Shenyang symposium record published on May 14 had the subtitle: "Democratic Party Organizations Are Like 'Vases' in Universities, Just for Show..." and so on. There are countless similar subtitles. When deleting the symposium speech records, most of the positive opinions were also deleted.

Because some of our reporters and editors have vague political understanding and unstable positions, they were instructed by Chu Anping in Chu Anping's implementation of the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy activities, and unconsciously became executors who set fires everywhere. A few people even stood on the same position as the bourgeois rightists, catering to and agreeing with them on some issues, and some stirred up trouble. We will conduct further in-depth self-examination of this aspect of the problem.

Distorting the Policy of Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision, Attempting to Lead Democratic Parties to the Bourgeois Political Direction

While selling his bourgeois democracy to the society, Zhang Bojun also used his position as president to influence our editorial department with his absurd propositions of "bicameral system" and "democratic parties have great potential." After Chu Anping came to the newspaper, he concretized Zhang Bojun's conspiracy in the propaganda work. They deviated from the political foundation of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" – socialism, and distorted the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. When they publicized the activities of the democratic parties, they tried their best to exaggerate the role of the democratic parties in state affairs. They vigorously emphasized the "supervision" of the Communist Party, attempting to instigate the democratic parties to usurp and resist the Party's leadership. Chu Anping said that Guangming Daily's past propaganda on the role of democratic parties in educating and transforming members "turned the bridge role of democratic parties between the masses and the Party into a single-plank bridge." Therefore, he very much emphasized the so-called "double-track" propaganda policy, saying that it was necessary to focus on publicizing that democratic parties represent the interests of the masses and supervise the Communist Party. Chu Anping was not very interested in the important task of democratic parties – ideological and political work. Instead, he implied that only democratic parties represent the interests of the intellectual masses, and therefore they should represent them to supervise the Communist Party. This is to portray the Communist Party as a party that is detached from the intellectual masses and to pit the Party against intellectuals. He tried to grab intellectuals into his own hands and turn democratic parties from the Party's assistants into the Party's opponents and enemies. This is the main component of Chu Anping's repeated propaganda that Guangming Daily should sing a "counter-show" with the People's Daily.

Under the guidance of Chu Anping's propaganda policy, a series of serious political errors occurred in the newspaper's propaganda on the nature and tasks of the democratic parties.

First, in many news reports and symposium speeches during this period, the shouts that democratic parties were not valued, did not play a role, and that democratic people had positions but no power were published in prominent positions in the newspaper, attempting to create the impression of a "Party world" among readers. It is true that there is a certain factual basis for reporting that some grassroots organizations of democratic parties are not valued, do not play a sufficient role, and that the powers of some non-Party people holding government leadership positions are not respected enough. However, we have exaggerated these individual phenomena and drawn universal conclusions; and even in some reports, we have distorted the facts. In this way, the relationship between the democratic parties and the Party has been provoked. What is even worse is the attempt to instigate the democratic parties to oppose the Communist Party. During this period, there was little or no correct propaganda on the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and there was little or no correct reporting on the role played by the democratic parties under the leadership of the CPC.

Second, on the first page of May 8, the news of the democratic parties in Xi'an discussing how to play the role of democratic parties stated that the past work of the democratic parties was: "Only standing on the Party's position, not standing on the position of the masses. Because only standing on one side, it is impossible to well reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the Party..." This is to pit the Party against the intellectual masses, affirming that the Communist Party is detached from the masses. This news item promoted the fallacy that only democratic parties can represent the intellectual masses.

Third, in the early stage of the great speaking out and helping the CPC's rectification, a large number of reports were made of democratic parties "supporting" some people's attacks on the Party. For example, the news of the symposium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party published on the second page of May 27, the news of the meeting of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy published on the second page of June 1, and the news of the meeting of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society published on the second page of June 3, actually said that if members of democratic parties and the masses they are connected with are attacked for "speaking out" and helping the Communist Party's rectification, the democratic parties will vigorously "support" them. Not only was it written like this in the news, but it was also marked with a large-character headline, startlingly. From the logic of news writing, it gave readers the impression that some people who help the Communist Party's rectification may be retaliated against by Party members. If such a thing happens, what is the Communist Party's attitude? Avoid talking about it. Only focusing on prominently publicizing that democratic parties are coming out to
  "bodyguard" and "support." Clearly showing a face: the Communist Party does not care about the intellectual masses, and may even attack them; only democratic parties protect their "legitimate interests." Putting the democratic parties in the position of the Communist Party's "opponent," and only the democratic parties' approach is correct, and the Communist Party will retaliate against intellectuals. Such vicious slander of the Communist Party.

Fourth, and even more erroneous, following this "propaganda" line, it developed to June 9, when the full text of the reactionary scientific program concocted by the Zhang-Luo alliance was published. What was even more serious was the organization of a "short commentary." It put forward the slogan of "protecting scientists" and said that this was a concrete new way and method for democratic parties to supervise the Communist Party, and that it was of great significance. This was a vicious provocation of the relationship between scientists and the Communist Party, and bluntly said: only democratic parties protect scientists, do not follow the Communist Party.

Fifth, disregarding the CPC's plan and steps for rectification, it reported three times on the symposiums of primary and secondary school teachers convened by the China Association for Promoting Democracy; and on May 16, it published a record of a symposium of secondary school teachers in its entirety. When publishing these reports and symposium records, some vicious words were used to arouse the dissatisfaction of primary and secondary school teachers with the Party.

Sixth, after the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee convened the symposiums of democratic parties and the business community, some responsible comrades of the Party Department of this newspaper drafted four questions, and with the support of Chu Anping, prepared to "general" Minister Li Weihan. Among them, there were such questions: "Can it be said that the speaking out at these two symposiums was open?" "In your opinion, are the internal contradictions of the people that have been revealed expected, or are you surprised?" and so on. Although this attempt to "general" did not materialize, it can also be seen what kind of position and attitude they took in the reporting work of the democratic parties.

In addition, what is even more vicious and serious is that after the people of the whole country began to fight back against the rightists, Xie Jie, a staff member of this newspaper, also attempted to maliciously slander the anti-rightist struggle by interviewing a news story about a symposium of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party. The Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party held a symposium on June 11, and Xie Jie focused on writing about the opinions opposing anti-criticism at this meeting, such as saying, "Is the method of besieging Wang Meng being used to besiege Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi now?" and "It must be considered not to hinder the speaking out" and "Inappropriate anti-criticism will cause injustice," etc. (This malicious report was not published).

This series of propaganda reports illustrates a fact that the propaganda reports of this newspaper on the democratic parties during this period were under the instructions of bourgeois rightist ambitious elements, distorting the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, attempting to lead the democratic parties to the bourgeois political direction, and to turn the democratic parties into opponents and enemies of the Communist Party.

Distorting the Party's Policies, Provoking the Relationship Between the Party and Intellectuals

On May 4, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Boldly Implement the Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" (written by Pan Wenbin, director of the School Education Department of this newspaper, and personally reviewed and approved by Chu Anping). This editorial was a programmatic article in which this newspaper used the form of an editorial to incite intellectuals and young students.

The editorial equated the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" with the "May Fourth Movement," which is obviously a matter of principle error. The "May Fourth Movement" was an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal cultural revolution. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" "is the expression of freedom within the people in the fields of literary and scientific work" (Lu Dingyi). One is a revolutionary movement against the enemy, and the other is a question of freedom within the people. However, this editorial called for "inheriting and carrying forward the tradition of the May Fourth cultural revolution movement," blurring the line between the enemy and ourselves. Not only that, the editorial also described this policy as a "more magnificent and larger-scale cultural revolution movement" and a "ideological revolution movement," which is even more of a distortion of the spirit of the Party's policy.

The editorial repeatedly said that this policy is to oppose dogmatic thinking and opportunistic thinking. However, the point of opposing opportunistic thinking was not made clear, and in particular, the task of fighting against bourgeois ideology was not mentioned at all.

The beginning of the second paragraph of the editorial started with Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council and at the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Work Conference, as if this editorial was based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech. However, after reading the full text, it will be found that this editorial did not correctly explain the issue based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech, but only played the role of an "agitator." For example, the last sentence of the third paragraph from the end said: "...Understand the spirit of the central government's policies and guidelines, do not be a cold insect, but muster your strength to welcome spring." This not only distorted the spirit of the central government's policies, but also clearly resonated with Fei Xiaotong, a rightist "agitator," singing the same counter-tune.

If this editorial is used as a program to examine the reactionary reports and articles published by this newspaper during this period, then our errors in distorting the Party's policies, provoking the relationship between the Party and intellectuals are the most and the greatest. In this series of propaganda, the abnormal nature of the relationship between the Party and the masses was emphasized; its essence was to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals and incite the intellectuals' dissatisfaction with the Party.

We will only cite a few special articles and newsletters here for some self-examination.

This newspaper successively published Fei Xiaotong's "Before and After Early Spring" and Fan Puzhai's "Extracurricular Sounds." These two articles were both executing the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to win over intellectuals, carrying out agitational propaganda to the intellectual circles, and doing everything possible to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. In the former article, Fei Xiaotong advocated using "mutual supervision" to uncover the "lid," and even proposed "rushing open" the lid. In the latter article, Fan Puzhai viciously attacked Party members and activists, and further incited intellectuals to "vent" the "boredom" in their "stomachs" in "speaking out." These two articles were personally solicited or personally handled by Chu Anping during the so-called "spring blossoms season," that is, when poisonous weeds were growing.

Why did Chu Anping greatly appreciate these reactionary remarks? Chu Anping once advocated that Guangming Daily should become a forum for democratic parties and senior intellectuals. He wanted to organize and publish these reactionary remarks in order to fulfill his so-called "supervision" responsibility.

Many of the newsletters written by reporters of this newspaper have serious errors. Two articles are cited here. One is the Wuhan newsletter entitled "Feeling Lonely Everywhere, Neighbors Like Strangers" written by reporter Wen Bing. This newsletter is full of the dissatisfaction of some intellectuals, generalizing from the individual to the general to render the Party's disrespect and distrust of intellectuals, and completely distorting the face of the vast number of intellectuals today. This played an inciting role in the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. The writing style of this article completely lacks analysis and criticism of erroneous opinions, and there is no speaker's name, and the author's thoughts and feelings completely resonated with the speaker.

Another one is the Wuhan newsletter written by reporter Qiu Lin, reporting on the rightist Ma Zhemin's talk about why Wuhan cannot "speak out." Ma Zhemin scolded the ideological reform movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, which was extremely bad. The reporter reported it regardless of right and wrong. The newsletter wrote: "Professor Ma Zhemin said: It is difficult for them to have real interest and emotion in 'contending' other issues if they are not allowed to pour out such bitterness and complaints." The entire conversation was permeated with malice and incitement. The reporter actually recorded everything he heard and promoted Ma Zhemin's fallacies.

Opposing the Party's Leadership in Higher Education

One of the conspiracies in the Zhang-Luo alliance was to encourage professors in universities to oppose the responsibility system of the Party committee. Chu Anping executed this conspiracy. During this period, this newspaper published many reports, inciting the dissatisfaction of university professors with the Party, opposing the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities, causing widespread and extremely bad effects.

This conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance has been premeditated for a long time. They used the "Central Committee of the China Democratic League Work Bulletin" (internal publication, published in the 15th issue on May 10) to boldly distort the opinions of the highest leadership on this issue and spread rumors in advance, saying that the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities could be considered for change. The comrades concerned in this newspaper were influenced ideologically and actually believed that the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities would be abolished sooner or later. From the report published on the first page of May 7 on the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Party Committee of Tsinghua University, the China Democratic League, and the Jiusan Society, the one-sided opinions dissatisfied with the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities were emphasized, and the large-character headline "Discussing the Issue of Changing the Responsibility System of the Party Committee in Universities" was marked as the top news on the first page. Since then, in several reports, it has been repeatedly rendered, creating public opinion against the responsibility system of the Party committee, and confusing right and wrong.

The most prominent example of the erroneous reports in this regard is the report "Fudan University Abolishes the Responsibility System of the Party Committee." This inaccurate and erroneous report has caused adverse political effects. Readers from all over the country have written letters reflecting that some schools have already caused confusion due to the instigation of this news. Many readers have raised questions and demanded a self-examination and a public response. This newspaper has already published a self-examination report on this error on July 5. What is worth emphasizing here now is that Chu Anping has always refused to admit this error. He refused to publish a correction message admitting the error, but instead arranged for reporters to interview Mr. Chen Wangdao and wrote the news published on June 5, as we said in the self-examination report, intending to cover up the error. What is even more vicious is that when he saw the People's Daily published the news that Fudan University had not abolished the responsibility system of the Party committee, he repeatedly deliberated with the comrades concerned on why the People's Daily wanted to publish this news, wanted to confront the People's Daily, and said at the department director meeting of this newspaper, "The People's Daily insists that we are wrong," asking everyone to go back to each department to convey this, in order to provoke the relationship between the staff of this newspaper and the People's Daily. The person who handled this news was Pan Wenbin, director of the School Education Department. He had long thought that the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities had many "problems" and would be abolished sooner or later. Therefore, regardless of whether this manuscript was reliable, he did not verify it, nor did he consider the political impact after publication, and treated it as good news and asked the reporter to write it out immediately. After the People's Daily pointed out the error, Pan Wenbin still did not realize his mistake, but instead ignored the advice of Party member comrades, personally visited Mr. Chen Wangdao, and sent reporters to visit other people who participated in the symposium, intending to cover up the error. Despite the fact that the result still proved that the report was wrong, in the end, according to Chu Anping's intention, he wrote such a report that seemed to be a correction but was not, and in essence was a confrontation with the People's Daily, further confusing right and wrong. This shows that the error in publishing this inaccurate news was not simple, but that Pan Wenbin had an erroneous view of the Party's leadership in universities ideologically, and thus resonated with Chu Anping.

In order to conspire to abolish the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities, the Zhang-Luo alliance set fires everywhere in several universities. One of the methods was to clamor for the so-called "democratic school management." On June 4, this newspaper reported on the situation of the symposium held by Beijing Normal University under the leadership of the rightist Tao Dayong, speaking for the rightists. In addition, the reports of the Wuhan and Guangzhou symposiums in the "Nine-City Symposium" emphasized the propaganda that negated the achievements of teaching reform in higher education. What is even more serious is that in a report "Three Scholars in Qingdao Talk About 'Speaking Out and Contending'" published in this newspaper on June 12, the absurd opinions of the rightist Lu Kanru on the responsibility system of the Party committee in universities were still published.

Not only that, but also made reports that distorted the facts and completely negated the achievements of the rectification work of some universities. The report "Renmin University of China Is Like a Dogmatic Beehive" written by reporter Xu Ying is a significant example. This report aroused the protest of thousands of students and faculty members of Renmin University of China.
  This report negated all the achievements of Renmin University of China in the past few years. It slandered the Marxist-Leninist teaching work of Renmin University of China as spreading toxins like poisonous bees, and even used the most vicious words to scold Party member comrades. It exaggerated the one-sided erroneous opinions in the symposium, and only gave a brief overview of the positive and well-intentioned criticisms. What is even more vicious is that the worst adjectives in the report were extracted and made into a sensational reactionary title. This report, from beginning to end, only used the worst adjectives to scold this new type of socialist school, and in essence, on the one hand, it used the slogan of anti-dogmatism to slander the position of studying and promoting Marxism-Leninism; on the other hand, it made a "negative" propaganda on the question of whether the Party can lead universities.

There are also some reports and articles that have played a destructive role in the rectification of some schools. For example, on May 9, a report criticizing Beijing Normal University for "not daring to let go boldly" was published, saying: "Outside, the thunder is loud, and there is no wind and rain in Beijing Normal University." In fact, the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University has organized and is preparing to continue to organize teacher symposiums in a step-by-step manner, hoping to hear the opinions of the teachers. The publication of this report echoed the rightists in the school and fueled the arrogance of the rightists in the school. Subsequently, on May 22, an article "My Appeal" by Mu Mutian, a professor in the Chinese Department of the school and a rightist, was published. This article made a vicious attack on the Party Committee of the school with unwarranted matters, which added fuel to the fire, making the arrogance of the rightists in the school even higher, and the absurd remarks of the rightists were very rampant for a time, disrupting the rectification steps of the school.

Inciting College Students to Make Trouble

Setting fires at the grassroots level and among college students is an important conspiracy activity of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other rightists against the Communist Party, the people, and socialism. Chu Anping used Guangming Daily to set fires among college students. Under his direct command, the report "Peking University Opens 'Democracy Wall'" was published on May 26. Chu Anping ran to

    光明日报在章伯钧、储安平篡改政治方向期间所犯错误的检查
    光明日报编辑部
    我们在反对资产阶级右派分子章伯钧、储安平篡改本报政治方向罪行的同时，对编辑部工作进行了检查。正如6月14日人民日报编辑部写的“文汇报在一个时间内的资产阶级方向”文章中对本报所作的批评，在储安平实际掌握编辑业务的这短短的一段时间里，即是从5月到6月上旬期间，本报的基本政治方向变成了资产阶级报纸的方向。
    储安平是4月1日到职的。头三个星期，他是在编辑部“了解情况”。4月19日，中共中央统战部邀请各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士协商决定光明日报完全由民主党派独立自主来办，并撤销党组。储安平从这个时候开始实际掌握编辑业务，并且按照章罗联盟的政治阴谋，利用“百家争鸣”这个口号和共产党的整风运动，在报纸上发表了大量表现资产阶级观点而并不准备批判的文章和带煽动性的报道。八年来坚决站在社会主义旗帜下的衷心接受中国共产党领导的这张民主党派报纸——光明日报，就这样地被资产阶级右派分子攫为反共反人民反社会主义的宣传工具。
    我们不能不愤怒地来控诉章伯钧、储安平把我们的报纸拉出了社会主义轨道、作为他们反共反人民反社会主义工具的罪行。
    章罗联盟企图篡改本报政治方向，同文汇报相呼应，为他们的政治阴谋进行煽惑鼓动，早就有了打算。在党提出“长期共存、互相监督”方针后，章伯钧对本报即表示分外的关心。去年夏天，章伯钧已有若干活动。储安平担任总编辑以后，章伯钧对报社工作空前地“积极”起来。他曾几次来到报社，与储安平有所策划。储安平也口口声声说章社长对这有指示，对那有意见。储安平也时常用信件、电话、面谈等方式，向章伯钧汇报工作。他们之间的联系是十分密切的。可是把报社最高管理机关——社务委员会完全撇开，迄储安平辞职前，没有召开过一次会议。
    根据已经揭露的材料，章伯钧曾提出这样一些意见：一、他认为本报过去带头横排，现在可以带头直排。这是他反对文字改革一套活动中的一个部分。二、他要报纸多报道民主党派负责人的活动。实质上，就是要我们替他作宣传，抬高他的地位，作为政治阴谋的资本。三、他主张多登资本主义国家通讯社的新闻，多反映资本主义国家社会党的活动。储安平对这些意见，极力支持。章伯钧在5月中旬曾特地来报社通知储安平，说这样的热闹还要继续一年半载，主张赶快把所有的专刊都停掉，腾出版面来作反党的宣传。在人民日报社论“这是为什么”发表的前夕，他打电话给储安平，说章乃器批评光明日报在“收”了，这样来为储安平的反党宣传打气。至于进一步控制本报作为章罗联盟的宣传工具，章伯钧最近已经承认：关于光明日报的整个改组，要等到摸清情况后再说。可见他们是大有一番计划的。
    为了篡改本报的政治方向，储安平来到报社后，进行了不少的活动。首先，他宣传了章罗联盟的办报主张。他认为，今天的报纸，应该回头来向解放前国民党地区的旧报纸学习；向文汇报学习。他否认报纸有指导工作、推动工作的作用。他把我们报纸八年来所发表的社论，一口否定；他认为那些社论不是歌功颂德的，就是教条主义的。他主张要写社论，就要写他所谓的“批评性”的、起“监督”作用的社论。而他又认为这样的社论不好写，因为本报是各民主党派联合主办的，“婆婆”太多。所以，在我国政治生活如此重要的时期里，对党的整风、对国内重大问题，除掉在5月4日发表了一篇有严重错误的社论外，他不但不去组织社论，就是已经写好的关于共青团第三次代表大会的社论，也加以挑剔、不准刊登。在新闻报道上，他的方针实际上就是“只管揭露，抹杀成绩”八个大字。他曾公开说：“我们的任务是揭露，解决问题是共产党的事。”他主张只要是事实，什么新闻都可以登。他喜欢抢新闻，喜欢“独家新闻”，喜欢内幕新闻。他要我们的编辑、记者不怕闯祸。他说，报纸和共产党、人民政府存在着根本的矛盾，即是有些新闻，报纸要登，党和政府不要登。他主张在国际报道方面要用帝国主义国家的通讯社的消息，而且要不加分析地直接采用。他还要多多报道资本主义国家社会党的活动。他说目前各报的国际新闻编排得很不好，不适合知识分子的口味，并以费孝通的意见为代表。在干部中间，储安平还以“了解情况”、“走群众路线”为名，用各种面孔和手段，兜售他的资产阶级办报路线，并摸编辑部的底。在这期间，储安平不仅要看他认为重要稿件的小样，而且有些稿子由他亲自约来或亲自处理；重要采访工作，他故意摆脱总编室主任或部主任党员负责同志，亲自指挥。
    在这期间，由于储安平执行章罗联盟的政治阴谋，我们的报纸攻击党对文教事业的领导；歪曲党的政策，挑拨党和知识分子的关系，散布对党的不满情绪；鼓吹绝对民主和个人主义的自由；煽动大学生闹事；歪曲民主党派和共产党长期共存、互相监督的方针；夸大人民内部矛盾，否定成绩，把新中国涂成一片漆黑；宣传资产阶级新闻观点和作风。在编排方法上，着意渲染，加强了恶劣的宣传效果。
    编辑部的工作同志，在这一段时期里，在采访、编辑工作上，也有不少人犯了相当严重的错误。对于这些错误，我们正在严肃认真地进行检查。
    感谢党及时向我们发出了警号，指示我们从错误中清醒过来，和全国人民一道向资产阶级右派分子展开了斗争，把我们的报纸转回到革命的社会主义的道路上来。
    感谢广大的读者，及时向我们提出了批评。我们收到大量的读者来信，指出宣传上的许多错误。有不少读者，还亲自到报社来提意见。有的读者来报社要向储安平说理。读者的批评，对我们的工作检查有很大的帮助，我们诚恳接受，并在这里致谢，不再分别函复了。
    处处点火的九大城市座谈会
    储安平抓业务的第一步，就是派出记者到九大城市召开座谈会，处处点火，打乱整风步骤。煽动人民对党不满，把正在蓬蓬勃勃建设社会主义社会的新中国涂成一片漆黑，妄图达到反共反人民反社会主义的目的。
    九大城市座谈会是储安平亲自指挥的一个大规模的阴谋活动。他在章伯钧的支持下，既不同中共中央统战部联系，也没有向各民主党派中央请示，就作了布置。在记者出发前，储安平面授机宜，指示记者，要找有代表性的、素来有不满情绪而又敢于说话的人参加座谈。有一个记者曾经向储请示，如果有些人虽有代表性而“无事可鸣”，有些人虽“敢于鸣放”而却没有什么代表性又怎么办？储安平肯定地指示，邀请后者。这就充分表明了他是企图利用那些心怀不满的人，利用知识分子落后的一面来为章罗联盟的阴谋打先锋。储安平还怕这些人有“顾虑”，要记者在邀请之前，分别登门拜访，煽动这些人大鸣大放。完全撇开当地中共党委，他只叫记者和民主党派地方组织联系。有些地方，储安平还亲自写信与当地的右派分子直接联系，或者指明要记者找那些右派分子，找那些人就某些问题鸣放。例如复旦大学的王恒守，是上海第一个提出取消高等学校党委负责制、主张所谓“教授治校”的右派分子，储安平就指示驻上海记者一定要邀王恒守参加座谈（按：驻上海记者没有接受这个指示）。这种布置，显然是为了集中力量对党对政府进行攻击。
    从5月初起，在短短一个月里，见报的座谈纪录就有十一次，占了十二个整版，约有十三万字。除了座谈纪录而外，组织座谈会的记者还拍发了近二十个专电，写了十几篇通讯，一直到6月5日见报的青岛座谈会纪录始告结束。在这一段时间里，我们的报纸，为资产阶级右派分子提供了讲坛，发出了大量的荒谬言论，对党进行了恶毒的攻击，在各地造成了极坏的影响。
    从我们编辑部工作人员来说，在这些座谈会的报道工作中，也暴露出许多问题。
    座谈会的组织和报道，各地情况有所不同。最恶劣的如沈阳，主持这个工作的本报党派部第二主任王少桐，甚至采取了向中共省委书记“将军”的办法，用对立的态度提出难题，例如什么“这里鸣放不起来有历史根源，你的看法怎样？”等等。另一记者殷毅还写了鼓吹“自发鸣放”的题为“第一朵迎春花”的通讯。又如在武汉有一个座谈会，这个会如何召开，邀那些人参加，是和右派分子马哲民商议的。我们的记者在那里还一连举行了三个座谈会。主持这一工作的学校教育部主任潘文彬还说：“这次到武汉是储安平首次亲自布置工作，要做好！”潘文彬还写了两篇通讯：“武汉书简”和“四顾无知己，比邻若天涯”，强调所谓“春风不渡武胜关”和党与知识分子关系不正常。广州座谈会开过以后，主持工作的记者，竟然还有“不满足”之感，认为谈得不够“尖锐”！在储安平所谓“依靠民主党派”的指示下，西安、兰州的座谈会，几乎为右派分子所操纵。青岛座谈会是由记者钟光贵主动要求举行的（储安平原来也有此打算）。这个座谈会由右派分子徐一贯主持，并听任徐一贯的操纵，多邀右派分子参加。钟光贵在报道座谈会的消息的“专讯”上，也大量摘录了徐一贯的反动的具有煽动性的发言。主持南京座谈会的记者，推说时间来不及，竟不愿把纪录给党委统战部看。总之，按照储安平的指示，要撇开党来“帮助党整风”。只是上海座谈会，对当地党委领导的鸣放，起了些协调作用。
    到各地的记者按照储安平的指示，下车伊始，不等开会就发回专电：这里没动，那里不放。5月3日就登了两条消息：“武汉知识界的鸣放密云不雨”，“山东文教界认为领导对鸣放支持不够”，5日，“沈阳文教部门鸣放空气稀薄”，6日，“西安有些高等学校没有贯彻鸣放的精神”，8日“南京鸣放空气不甚浓厚”。这些接连出现的专电，总起来是一句话，党不放，我们要他放。座谈会的消息，也在当天用专电拍回，而专电的内容，把最具有煽动性的、强调“春寒”“春迟”，“深沟高墙”的所谓“警句”，集中地、突出的摘录下来；或者以记者自己的口吻加以夸张；或者假用所谓“有些人说”把记者与发言人的“共鸣”之点，加以渲染。如5月11日的沈阳专电：“有些党员，还该纠正‘老子天下第一’的思想和傲然‘鹤立鸡群’的气势。”5月10日武汉专电：“大家认为……甚至一般党员都自视为统治者、改造者、把党外知识分子看作被统治者、被改造者，以至在党群之间挖下了一条不可逾越的鸿沟……”。但是，我们这次检查武汉座谈会的发言纪录，并没有所谓“统治者、被统治者”字样。这更是无中生有了。如5月15日南京专电：“大家认为南京还是早春气候，有人认为，在基层还被严寒封锁”。座谈会消息的标题，更是以“推墙填沟”，“轰开局面”，“顾虑重重”等等煽动性词句来形容党群关系一团糟。在编排座谈会纪录时，也把每个发言人的最坏的词句，集中扼要地编成黑字小插题，极尽挑拨煽动之能事。如5月11日发表的西安座谈会纪录小插题有“三个大老虎，变成三个大妖魔”（按：即指主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义）；5月17日发表的武汉座谈会纪录的小插题有：“武汉大学的党群之间有一座铜墙铁壁，这是有些党员的特权阶级作风筑成的铜墙铁壁……”；5月14日发表的沈阳座谈会纪录的小插题有：“民主党派组织，在高等学校里像‘花瓶’，是摆样子的……”等等。类似这样的小插题，多得不胜枚举。在删节座谈会发言纪录时，也大都把正面的意见删掉。
    由于我们的记者编辑中，有的同志政治认识模糊、立场不稳，在储安平执行章罗联盟反党反人民反社会主义的阴谋活动中，受了储安平的指使，不自觉地成了处处点火的执行者。个别的人，甚至同资产阶级右派分子站在一个立场，在若干问题上，迎合附和者有之，兴风作浪者亦有之。我们对这方面的问题将作进一步的深入检查。
    歪曲宣传长期共存、互相监督方针，企图把民主党派引向资产阶级的政治方向
    章伯钧在向社会上贩卖他的资产阶级民主的同时，以他社长的地位也把什么“两院制”、“民主党派大有可为”的荒谬主张，来影响我们的编辑部。储安平来到报社以后，更把章伯钧的阴谋在宣传工作中具体化。他们离开了“长期共存、互相监督”的政治基础——社会主义，来歪曲长期共存、互相监督的政策，他们在宣传民主党派的活动的时候，竭力夸张民主党派在国家事务中的作用。大肆强调对共产党的“监督”，企图煽动民主党派篡夺和对抗党的领导。储安平说光明日报过去宣传民主党派教育成员和改造成员思想的作用，是把“民主党派在群众和党之间的桥梁作用，变成了一座独木桥。”因此，他非常强调所谓“双轨”的宣传方针，说是要着重宣传民主党派代表群众利益监督共产党。对于民主党派的重要任务——思想政治工作，储安平很不感兴趣，而是意在言外地认为只有民主党派是代表知识分子群众的利益，因而要代表他们监督共产党。这就是把共产党描绘成为一个脱离知识分子群众的党，并把党和知识分子对立起来。企图把知识分子抓到自己的手里，把民主党派由党的助手变为党的对手和敌手。这是储安平一再宣传光明日报要和人民日报唱“对台戏”的主要的组成部分。
    在储安平宣传方针的指导下，本报对民主党派性质、任务的宣传，出现了一系列的、严重的政治错误。
    首先，在这一段时期的许多新闻报道和座谈会发言中，把叫嚣民主党派不受重视、没有发挥作用以及民主人士有职无权等等，用显著的地位登在报上，企图在读者中造成“党天下”的印象。对于报道有些民主党派基层组织不受重视，发挥作用不够，以及对某些担任政府领导工作的非党人士的职权尊重不够，是有一定事实根据的。但是，我们却夸大了这些个别现象，得出普遍性的结论；甚至在某些报道中，还歪曲了事实。这样，就挑拨了民主党派和党的关系，更为恶劣的是企图煽动民主党派反对共产党。在这一段时期，极少甚至没有正确地宣传长期共存、互相监督的方针，极少甚至没有正确地报道民主党派在中共领导下所发挥了的作用。
    第二，5月8日第一版，刊载了西安各民主党派讨论如何发挥民主党派作用的新闻中，认为民主党派过去的工作是：“只站在党的立场，没有站在群众的立场上。因为只站在一面，就不能很好地向党反映群众的意见和要求……”这是把党和知识分子群众对立起来，肯定共产党是脱离群众的。这条新闻，宣传了只有民主党派能代表知识分子群众的谬论。
    第三，在大鸣大放和帮助中共整风的初期，大量报道了民主党派为某些人向党进攻“撑腰”。如5月27日第二版刊登的农工民主党座谈会的新闻，6月1日二版刊登的民进北京市委的会议新闻，6月3日二版刊登的九三学社北京分社的会议新闻中，竟说：民主党派成员和所联系的群众，如因为“鸣放”和帮助共产党整风遭到打击，民主党派一定大力“撑腰”。不但新闻中如此写，而且用一号字的大标题，触目惊心地标了出来。由新闻写作的逻辑来看，给了读者这样一种印象：有些人帮助共产党整风，可能会受到党员的报复。如遇这种事情，共产党的态度如何呢？避而不谈。只着重突出地宣传民主党派要出来
  “保镖”、“撑腰”。鲜明地摆出一副面孔：共产党不管知识分子群众，甚而会打击他们；只有民主党派是保护他们的“正当利益”。把民主党派放在共产党“敌手”地位，而且只有民主党派的作法正确，共产党是会给知识分子打击报复的。就这样的恶毒地诬蔑了共产党。
    第四，更为错误的，循着这样的“宣传”路线，发展到6月9日，刊登了章罗联盟所搞的反动的科学纲领全文，更严重的是组织了“短评”。提出“保护科学家”的口号，并说这是民主党派对共产党监督的具体的新的方式方法，认为有很重大的意义。这是恶毒地挑拨了科学家和共产党的关系，露骨地说：只有民主党派是保护科学家的，不要跟共产党走。
    第五，不顾中共整风的计划和步骤，三次报道民主促进会召开的中小学教师的座谈会；5月16日而还以整整一版的篇幅，刊载了一个中学教师的座谈会纪录。而在刊登这些报道和座谈会纪录的时候，有的采用了恶劣的词句，以煽起中小学教师对党的不满。
    第六，在中共中央统战部召开的民主党派座谈会和工商界座谈会结束之后，本报党派部有的负责同志拟了四个问题，在储安平支持下准备向李维汉部长“将军”。其中有这样的问法：“能不能说这两次座谈会的鸣放是敞开的？”“在你看来，所揭露出来的人民内部矛盾，是意料所及呢，还是大吃一惊呢？”等等。这次“将军”的企图虽然没有实现，但也可以看出他们在民主党派报道工作上究竟采取了什么样的立场和态度。
    另外，更其恶劣、严重的是：本报工作人员谢捷在全国人民开始反击右派之后，她还企图通过采访农工民主党一个座谈会的新闻，别有用心地诬蔑反右派斗争。农工民主党在6月11日举行了一个座谈会，谢捷集中写了这个会上反对反批评的意见，如说什么“现在是不是用围剿王蒙的方法来围剿储安平和葛佩琦呢？”和“必须考虑到不要阻碍了鸣放”以及“反批评不恰，就会引起不平”等等（这个别有用心的报道，没有见报）。
    这一系列的宣传报道，说明了一个事实，这一时期的本报对民主党派的宣传报道，是在资产阶级右派野心分子的指使下，歪曲了长期共存、互相监督方针，企图把民主党派引向资产阶级的政治方向，要把民主党派变成共产党的对手和敌手。
    歪曲党的政策，挑拨党和知识分子的关系
    5月4日，本报发表了题为“大胆贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针”的社论（本报学校教育部主任潘文彬执笔，经储安平亲自审阅同意）。这篇社论是本报利用社论形式，向知识分子和青年学生进行煽动的一篇具有纲领性的文章。
    社论中把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策和“五四运动”相提并论，显然是原则性的错误。“五四运动”是反帝反封建的文化革命。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策“是人民内部的自由在文艺工作和科学工作领域中的表现”（陆定一）。一个是对敌人的革命运动，一个是人民内部的自由问题。而这篇社论却号召“继承和发扬五四的文化革命运动的传统”，把敌我的界限混淆了。不仅如此，社论还把这个政策说成是“波澜更为壮阔、规模更为宏伟的文化革命运动”和“思想革命运动”，更是对党的这个政策精神的歪曲。
    社论一再说这个政策是为了反对教条主义思想和机会主义思想。但是对于反机会主义思想的这一点，说的不明不白，特别是跟资产阶级思想进行斗争这一任务，文内根本没有谈到。
    社论第二段开头，是从毛主席在最高国务会议和在中共中央宣传工作会议上的讲话谈起的，仿佛这篇社论是根据毛主席讲话的精神来论述的。但是，读了全文以后，就会发现，这篇社论并没有正确地根据毛主席讲话的精神来阐释问题，而只是在尽“吹鼓手”的煽动作用。如倒数第三段的末句说：“……体会中央的方针政策的精神，不要作寒虫，而要鼓起力量，迎接春天。”这就不仅歪曲了中央的政策精神，而且，很显然是和费孝通这个右派的“吹鼓手”相共鸣，唱同样的反调。
    如果把这篇社论作为一个纲领来检查本报在这段期间发表的反动报道和文章，那么，歪曲党的政策，挑拨党和知识分子的关系，我们在这方面的错误是最多最大的。在这一系列的宣传中，着重夸张党群关系的不正常；其实质就是挑拨党和知识分子的关系，煽动知识分子对党的不满。
    我们在这里只举出几篇专论和通讯来作一些检查。
    本报先后发表了费孝通的“早春前后”和范朴斋的“会外之音”两篇文章。这两篇文章，都是执行章罗联盟拉拢知识分子的阴谋，向知识界做煽动宣传，极尽挑拨党和知识分子关系之能事的。在前一篇文章里，费孝通主张要“互相监督”来揭开“盖子”，甚至提出“冲开”盖子。在后一篇文章里，范朴斋恶毒地攻击了党员和积极分子，并进一步煽动知识分子要在“鸣”“放”中把“肚子里的闷气”“发泄”出来。而这两篇文章，正是在所谓“春暖花开时节”，亦即毒草滋长的时候，由储安平亲自约来或亲自处理的。
    为什么储安平对于这些反动言论大为欣赏呢？储安平曾主张光明日报要成为民主党派和高级知识分子的讲坛。他就是要组织、刊载这种反动言论，来尽到他所谓的“监督”的责任。
    本报记者所写的一些通讯中，有不少是有严重错误的。这里举出两篇。一篇是记者文冰所写的题为“四顾无知己，比邻若天涯”的武汉通讯。这一篇通讯充满了某些知识分子的不满情绪，以个别概括一般地渲染了党对知识分子的不尊重、不信任，把今天广大知识分子的面貌全部歪曲。这在党和知识分子的关系上，起了煽动作用。这篇文章的写法，对于错误的意见，完全没有分析和批判，也没有发言人的姓名，作者的思想感情与发言人完全取得共鸣。
    另一篇，是记者丘林所写的武汉通讯，报道右派分子马哲民谈武汉为什么“鸣”不起来的问题。马哲民对思想改造运动和肃反运动，破口大骂，恶劣透顶。记者不分是非，加以报道。通讯中这样写道：“马哲民教授说：像这样的苦水和牢骚不让他们倾吐出来，要他们‘争鸣’别的问题是很难有真实的兴趣和感情的。”全篇谈话都是贯穿着恶意和煽动。记者竟然全部有闻必录，替马哲民的谬论作了宣传。
    反对党领导高等教育
    章罗联盟中的一项阴谋，是鼓动高等学校的教授起来反对党委负责制。储安平执行了这个阴谋。在这期间，本报发表了不少报道，煽动大学教授对党不满，反对高等学校的党委负责制，引起广泛的极为恶劣的影响。
    章罗联盟这个阴谋蓄意已久，他们利用“民盟中央工作简报”（内部刊物，载于5月10日出版的第15期）大胆歪曲最高领导方面关于这个问题的意见，预先散布谣言，说什么高等学校中的党委负责制可以考虑加以改变。本报有关同志，在思想上受到影响，竟认为高校中的党委负责制，迟早要取消。本报从5月7日在第一版发表的中共中央统战部、清华大学党委会、民盟、九三学社等召开座谈会的一个报道中，就强调了对高校党委负责制不满的片面意见，并标出了“讨论改变高等学校党委负责制问题”的大字标题，做了第一版的头条新闻。此后在若干报道中，一再加以渲染，制造反对党委负责制的舆论，混淆了是非。
    在这方面的错误报道中，最突出的例子是“复旦大学取消党委负责制”这个报道。这个失实的错误报道，造成了恶劣的政治影响。各地读者纷纷来信反映，有些学校已经因这条消息的煽动，引起了混乱现象。许多读者提出质问，并要求作检查和公开答复。本报已于7月5日就这个错误，发表了检查报告。现在值得在这里着重指明的，是储安平对这个错误始终不肯承认。他不肯发表承认错误的更正消息，反而布置记者去访问陈望道先生，写出了6月5日刊出的消息，如我们在检查报告中所说的，意图掩饰错误。而尤为恶劣的是，他看到人民日报发表复旦大学没有取消党委负责制的消息的时候，一再和有关同志推敲人民日报为什么要发这条消息，要和人民日报对抗，并在本报部主任会议上说什么“人民日报硬说我们错了”的话，要大家回到各部去传达，以挑拨本报工作人员与人民日报的关系。处理这条消息的，是学校教育部主任潘文彬。他在思想上早就认为高等学校中的党委负责制“毛病”很多，迟早要取消。因而，他对这一稿件，不管其是否可靠，不加核对，也不考虑发表后的政治影响，当作好新闻要记者立即写出。当人民日报指出错误以后，潘文彬仍然没有认识自己的错误，反而不顾党员同志的忠告，亲自访问了陈望道先生，并派记者访问了参加那次座谈会的其他人士，意图掩饰错误。尽管结果仍然证明报道是错误的，最后还是按照储安平的意图，写出那样一个似更正非更正、实质上是和人民日报对抗的报道，更加混淆了是非。这说明了发表这条失实消息的错误，原因并不简单，而是在潘文彬的思想上，对于党领导高等学校，有着错误的看法，从而与储安平有了共鸣。
    章罗联盟为了阴谋取消高等学校党委负责制，曾在若干高等学校内，处处点火。方式之一，是叫嚣所谓“民主办校”。6月4日，本报报道了北京师大在右派分子陶大镛主持下召开的座谈会的情况，为右派分子张目。此外，“九大城市座谈会”中的武汉和广州两个座谈会的报道，在高等教育问题上，强调了否定教学改革成绩的宣传。尤为严重的是，在6月12日本报发表的“青岛三位学者谈鸣和争”一个报道中，仍然把右派分子陆侃如有关高校党委负责制的荒谬意见发表了出来。
    不仅如此，还对于有些大学的整风工作做了歪曲事实、一口否定成绩的报道。本报记者徐颖所写的“中国人民大学像个教条主义的大蜂窝”一篇报道，就是显著的例子。这篇报道激起了中国人民大学数千同学和教工人员的抗议。
      这篇报道，否定了人大几年来全部的成就。诬蔑人大马克思列宁主义的教学工作像毒蜂一样在散布毒素，对党员同志竟以最恶毒的词句来谩骂。对座谈会中片面的错误意见加以夸张，对正面的善意的批评，只是轻描淡写的一笔带过。尤为恶劣的是，竟把报道中最坏的形容词摘出，做了一个耸人听闻的反动标题。这篇报道，从头到尾只顾引用最坏的形容词来谩骂这所社会主义的新型学校，实质上，一方面是利用反教条主义的口号，来毁谤学习和宣传马克思列宁主义的阵地；另一方面是在党能不能领导高等学校这一问题上，作了“否定”的宣传。
    还有一些报道和文章，对有些学校的整风，起了破坏作用。例如5月9日发表了一篇批评北京师范大学“不肯大胆的放”的报道，说：“外面雷声震耳，师大无风无雨。”实则北京师范大学党委会已经组织举行而且在准备有步骤地继续组织教师座谈会，希望听取教师们的意见。这条报道的发表，就与该校的右派分子起了呼应作用，助长了该校右派分子的嚣张气焰。继之于5月22日又发表了该校中文系教授、右派分子穆木天的文章“我的呼吁”。这篇文章以莫须有的事，向该校党委会进行了恶毒的攻击，这就火上加油，使该校右派分子的气焰更高，右派分子的荒谬言论一度非常猖獗，打乱了该校的整风步骤。
    煽动大学生闹事
    到基层点火，到大学生中点火，是章罗联盟和其他右派分子反共反人民反社会主义的一个重要的阴谋活动。储安平利用光明日报，在大学生中点了火。在他的直接指挥之下，5月26日发表了“北大开辟‘民主墙’”的报道。储安平跑到北大看了大字报，回来就通知本报学校教育部立即报道。总编室主任一再向储提出，这样报道一定会起煽动作用，扰乱整风步骤，对人民不利。但是他完全不理。他说：“是事实就要报道”。争论到最后，他断然地站起来说，要“考验考验”，一定要即日见报。总编室的意见也向学校教育部提出，有关同志说，“学生压力太大，不报道不行了。”“群众已经跑在前面了，报纸落后了！”这个报道是由学校教育部主任潘文彬亲自执笔的，他说要尽量向健康方向引导，强调不误学习帮助整风。但是，尽管他“煞费苦心”，一点也不能避免这个报道的强烈的煽动作用和恶劣后果。
    “北大开辟‘民主墙’”报道见报的第二天，储安平在到清华大学和钱伟长谈话之后，又指挥学校教育部报道清华大学学生的鸣放。学校教育部主任潘文彬和一些记者写出了清华等九大学学生鸣放的报道。储安平要立即发表。总编室主任提出坚决反对，发生了两天的两次大争论，第二次潘文彬在场，他也提出“部里的同志都主张发表”。经过这样剧烈的斗争以后，潘文彬始推故把这报道拖了下来没有发表。
    在北大民主墙的报道中，突出地反映了右派分子反对党的领导，反对社会主义，反对民主集中制的阴谋。诸如“出席团代大会的代表如何产生”“选拔留学生由党团员包办”，“毕业生分配工作时党员分配好的岗位”，“把政治课改为选修”，“取销学校中的党委负责制”等等。这些意见，有的是歪曲事实，有的是对党的恶毒进攻。
    在报道中，有着“据闻江隆基副校长也表示欢迎”的语句。这样的报道方式，正符合了右派分子篡改本报政治方向的办报方针。右派分子所采用的恶毒手段之一是向党“将军”，而这样的报道就正好符合了这个要求，向北大党领导将了一军。同时又等于向各地学生暗示（也可以说是明告）：“党欢迎这样做，可以大搞”。这是十分明显的错误。
    北大开辟“民主墙”的报道发表以后，在不少地方的大学里起了煽动作用，这个报道向那些学校的右派分子散播了对党进攻的恶毒方法，使得许多大学生受了迷惑，在那些学校里造成混乱。这里，也不能不指出，当时在章罗联盟控制下的两个报纸——文汇报和光明日报，在这个反动宣传上是相互呼应的。本报发表这个报道之后，文汇报接连发表了北大学生鸣放的报道。只是在本报内部进行了斗争之后，本报在这方面进一步的煽动才被制止了。
    宣传资产阶级办报观点
    大家知道，资产阶级右派分子为了遂行其反共反人民反社会主义的阴谋，所采取的手段之一，就是传播资产阶级办报观点的谬论，夺取新闻界的领导权。储安平在本报一方面坚决贯彻他的资产阶级办报路线，一方面对于宣传资产阶级办报观点的报道和文章，特别感到兴趣。而部分记者和编辑，同储安平有着不同程度的共鸣，因而也在报道上和组稿上犯了错误。
    在这一段期间里，我们发表了首都记者座谈会的报道，突出地表现了新闻记者应该是“无冕之王”的思想感情；又曾发表了第一次新闻工作座谈会的几个报道，突出地宣传了这次座谈会对新中国新闻工作全部否定的荒谬论点。
    关于第一次新闻工作座谈会的报道，错误是严重的。在有关工作同志与右派分子共鸣的基础上，强调地宣传了“老报人慷慨陈词”，渲染了反动统治时期的中国旧报传统；传播了许多含有毒素的资产阶级办报观点。例如，在5月17日发表了题为“三大主义阻碍了新闻事业的发展”的报道，文中说：“三座大山限制了新闻自由”，要党“开放绿灯”，有害地宣传了资产阶级新闻自由。尤其严重的是，主持这个采访工作的记者主动向张友鸾索取了“是蜜蜂，不是苍蝇”的发言稿，而这篇文章所宣传的正好是为资产阶级右派分子夺取新闻界领导权的企图而立言，也正好为右派分子把本报办成为一张反对派的报纸、和党报“唱对台戏”的阴谋，作了宣传，因此，储安平大加“赏识”，亲自处理发表。
    反动的编排手法
    在储安平反动的办报方针的指导和影响下，本报编辑工作人员采取了一系列反动编排手法，使得其源出于章罗联盟的“黑云”，笼罩了这一时期的整个版面，对党在八年来领导六亿人民建设新中国的伟大成就的真相，起了遮天蔽日的作用。
    林茵同志在解放军报所发表的“希望光明日报坚决走社会主义道路”一文，对本报所提出的批评是正确的。在这一段时间里，主要的错误，除了林茵同志所指出的：通过对新闻内容的取舍，通过对新闻标题的加工和制造假新闻以外，还有一点，就是假借“不愿发表姓名”的方式，发抒记者自己的思想感情。
    在新闻内容的取舍方面，诚如林茵同志所指出的，是采用了两种方法：一种是只刊载适合右派观点的新闻，不刊载和右派观点相反的新闻。只报忧不报喜，只谈缺点不谈成绩。在刊登各方面帮助党整风的会议新闻中，有许多标题都是直接引用少数右派分子的反动论点，或摘取有些发言中比较偏激的言词作成的。如5月16日当作一版头条处理的中共中央统战部座谈会新闻，就作了个“批评‘三大主义’和‘四大偏差’”的主题。其实，在这个座谈会上提到所谓“四大偏差”的只有一人。另一种方法是片面地报道各种座谈会的新闻，只报道适合右派口味的发言和意见，不报道不适合他们口味的发言和意见，有的以“摘其所要”的态度，对不适合口味的发言和意见任意删削，甚至有的时候颠倒是非，把少数人的意见说成是多数人的意见，把多数人的意见说成是个别人的意见。这样的例子是举不胜举的，可以说，九大城市座谈会的报道是集这类错误之大成。
    又如林茵同志所提出：“在利用新闻标题来宣传右派观点方面，光明日报作得更为出色。”
  “许多标题是抽取发言人的个别较偏激的言词写成的，有的适合右派分子口味的发言就用极鲜明、肯定的标题，不适合他们口味的发言就用很模糊的标题。”右派分子为了反对党的领导，特别抓住了宗派主义这一“要害”进攻，强调所谓“党群关系”，而我们的新闻标题也跟着突出和夸大了这一点，几乎用尽了“高墙深沟”“密云不雨”等极其夸张的词汇。5月21日发表北京航空学院鸣放座谈会的新闻，竟篡改了发言人的原话，标上了“在党群之间有一座‘万里长城’”的标题。甚至还有“坚决相信共产党大胆揭露矛盾，有人害怕报复要农工民主党撑腰”这样的符合右派分子反党阴谋的标题。在5月15日人民日报刊出题为“清华园教授开怀畅谈”的新闻后四天，本报竟发表了挑衅性的报道，并且作了“清华大学教授尚未开怀畅谈”的标题，企图抵消人民日报的正确报道。这就符合了储安平的与党报“唱对台戏”的办报方针。这些新闻都是以三栏以上的大字标题分别在一、二版显著刊载的，从而就更为扩大了它的恶劣影响。
    还有一种反动编排手法，就是突出反面论调，缩小正面意见。编辑在选稿和标题上，惟恐反面意见不突出。例如关于中共中央统战部座谈会的报道，一些右派分子发言中的最反动的部分，都被概括出来放在标题上，独有对革命前辈何香凝忠告右派分子的正面意见，却采取了回避态度，只是作了一个“何香凝书面发言”这样轻描淡写的标题。在处理工商界座谈会的报道上，也有突出的例子。例如对李康年所谓“定息二十年”的建议，版面上不但一再出现“认为给二十年定息才是赎买到底”之类的标题，并且在一版还报道了一个上海居民支持李康年的建议的来信。对于工商界其他右派分子如董少臣、毕鸣岐等，也被当作正面人物处理，见之于标题的是“关于撤出公方代表的建议，董少臣重新加以解释”，“毕鸣岐对千家驹的意见展开论争”。
    从错误中吸取教训，做好社会主义报纸的工作
    我们以沉痛的心情，对编辑工作进行了检查以后，认为章伯钧、储安平篡改本报政治方向这一严重罪行，是属于章罗联盟政治阴谋的组成部分，已由各民主党派中央向章伯钧、储安平追究政治责任，并将作出严肃的处理。对于前面所述一系列的反动宣传，从我们编辑部工作同志来说，也犯了不同性质的、不同程度的错误。
    应该指出，在储安平开始抓业务以后，特别是党的整风运动开始以后，储安平的资产阶级右派的政治面目日渐暴露出来，在有些问题上编辑部同志同他开始进行斗争。在储安平指挥组织九大城市座谈会的过程中，有的同志就提出过不同的意见，而储安平不予采纳。又如发表“北大开辟民主墙”报道的时候，也曾提出反对意见，更遭到了他粗暴的拒绝。在发表了这个报道以后，储安平还要发表北京九个大学学生鸣放的报道。并且，搬出钱伟长右派分子这个臭招牌，说钱伟长主张报纸应当组织中小学教师和工程技术人员的鸣放座谈会。为此，总编室主任同他接连进行了两次坚决的说理的斗争。北京九个大学学生鸣放的报道因此压了下来，组织中小学校教师座谈会的计划也没有布置下去。正是在这之后不久，储安平猖狂地发表了“党天下”的谬论，从而使编辑部的同志们大为清醒过来。
    可是，另一方面，储安平执行章罗联盟改变光明日报的政治方向的阴谋，在这一段时期，还是达到了目的。
    现在检查起来，我们主观认识上有些什么问题呢？编辑部同志对于人民内部矛盾的问题，对于鸣放的政策，都没有来得及进行认真的学习，理解得很不深刻或很不全面。而储安平对于党的方针政策则一律视为教条主义，根本否定。他在布置工作的时候只强调大胆揭露。许多记者、编辑同志在进行工作的时候，思想认识上很模糊。我们报纸在这一时期里，版面上一片“春寒”，记者和编者把章罗联盟的“吹鼓手”们所煽起的这类毒化气氛的情绪，用自己的口吻写进报道，写上标题。不分是非，不分香花和毒草，只是一股劲地鼓吹大鸣大放。许多同志在检查这一时期的工作中发现，当时完全迷失了方向，感到痛心。
    还必须严肃地提出来的是，在我们编辑部同志中，竟然出现了这样几个人：他们在暗云翻滚的那些日子里，倒向右转，伙同储安平一气，“合作”得很好。他们或者在思想上与右派起共鸣，热心“揭露”，大唱反调；或者在采访工作中用“有人说”、“据说”等方式，抒发自己的牢骚和不满，甚至无中生有，暗放冷箭；或者在编辑部内和储安平互相唱和，共同策划。这就使编辑部一时竟邪气上升，迷乱了不少人的眼睛，使得不少同志做了右派反动宣传的工具。
    回顾我们这一时期所犯的错误，暴露出我们编辑部的大部分同志身上所有的资产阶级思想和资产阶级新闻观点的严重性，表现了思想立场的模糊和动摇，在某些问题上或者在某些时候不能分清是非，因而犯了大量的不同情况的错误。
    光明日报自1949年6月16日创刊以来，一直是在党的领导下工作的。1954年，中国共产党应民主党派的要求，派了共产党员来担任总编辑和副总编辑，两年多来本报全体工作同志在党的直接领导下做出了成绩。储安平来担任总编辑以后，党员负责同志们诚心诚意地帮助他，使他在很短时间内做到有职有权，顺利地进行工作，而他就很快地利令智昏起来，偷天换日地利用鸣放政策和党的整风，篡改了报纸的政治方向。我们的不少同志也就是在离开了党的领导的情况下犯了一系列的错误的。
    根据这一惨痛的教训，我们要庄严地指出：离开了共产党的领导，就一定犯错误。作为各民主党派主办的光明日报，是一张革命的社会主义报纸，中国的民主党派是在共产党领导下的社会主义的民主党派。现在由民主党派独立自主来办这张报纸，是为了各民主党派中央更好地运用这张报纸，使这张报纸更好地起它应有的作用，进一步地为社会主义建设服务。因此，我们就要更好地争取和接受党的领导。我们全体同志宣誓要忠心接受党的领导；并要求党对这张报纸加强领导、监督和帮助。
    我们通过检查自己工作上的错误，深刻认识到，知识分子如果不彻底进行思想改造，不把根本立场转到工人阶级立场上来，不同工农紧密地结合在一起，那末，知识分子必然要犯错误。我们编辑部同志中，大部分是从旧社会来的，一部分是青年学生。几年以来，特别是近两年来，我们在党的直接教育下，虽然提高了政治认识，但是在我们的头脑里还有很多资产阶级的东西，思想立场的锻炼还很不够，自觉地进行自我改造和自我教育的情况也不一样。因此，在当前资产阶级右派分子煽起反共反人民反社会主义的恶风黑浪时，编辑部工作人员中间，竟有个别的人表示狂热的支持，也有不少的人在思想上起了共鸣，更多的人受了蒙蔽，迷失了方向，混淆了社会主义国家的报纸同资本主义国家的报纸的原则区别，做了资产阶级新闻自由论者的俘虏，或多或少犯了一些错误。所有这些，都是值得我们在反右派斗争中，进行检查、批判的。
    过去的错误是无法挽回了，我们的任务是从错误中吸取教训，从错误中进行学习，利用自己的切身经验，来教育自己。
    本报政治方向一度被右派分子篡改的事件，经过全体工作人员严肃的批判以后，特别是经过这次检查工作以后，“立场是根本转过来了，由章伯钧、储安平的反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级路线转到了革命的社会主义的路线。由此恢复了读者的信任，像一张社会主义的报纸了”。人民日报7月1日社论中这一段话，对我们编辑部的同志们来说，是一个莫大的勉励和支持。我们将继续努力，在党的领导下，彻底批判我们头脑中的资产阶级错误思想，彻底克服资产阶级新闻观点，坚持发扬人民报纸的光荣传统，以为人民服务、对人民负责的精神，把我们报纸办成真正的社会主义的报纸。人民日报社论同时指出，本报在编排技巧上“略嫌不足”，实际上存在着严重的缺点，我们将努力学习这方面的知识，学习其他报纸生动活泼的经验，弥补自己的缺陷。
    我们热诚地期待读者进一步地给予帮助。
