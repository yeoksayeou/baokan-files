    A Poisoned Arrow Released by "New Observer"
    Yao Wenyuan
    In the May 16th issue of "New Observer," there is a "Short Account of 'Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' in the Past Month," titled "When Buds Fill the Garden and First Open," written by "Our Correspondent," and published on the first page.
    To summarize in a simple sentence: This article is a poisoned arrow attacking the Party. Many of the main arguments of the rightists have been absorbed into this "short account" (?). Now let's extract a few points to take a look:
    First: Promoting Fei Xiaotong's erroneous tune of "early spring weather." "Mr. Fei Xiaotong's feelings have a certain representational significance. Because, 'early spring' does indeed explain the intellectuals' state of mind at the time. Since it is the climate of early spring, it is inevitable that it will be inconsistently warm and cold..."
    The vast majority of patriotic intellectuals in China have long been in the spring of the era. From the dark old China to the bright new China, they are bathed in the sunshine of spring. They fundamentally do not think that the six or seven years after liberation were "severe winter," and that now is "early spring." This so-called "early spring climate" actually "represents" the psychological state of the rightists among the intellectuals to a greater extent. They believe that now is the most suitable "climate" for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. They even arrogantly estimate that the "spring" of the rightists is coming, but their confidence is not sufficient. Their hearts are both happy and fearful. Happy because now is a time of great blooming and contending, and they can let go and launch attacks. Fearful of whether the Communist Party and the working class will counterattack. Their hearts are indeed somewhat "inconsistently warm and cold." So they create an "early spring climate," wanting to use this to remove the right to counterattack from those who support socialism. If anyone wants to counterattack, they are retreating from "early spring" to "severe winter." This trick is quite vicious and can indeed confuse many people before it is exposed. But they are left with empty joy. What awaits the rightists is not "early spring" but "severe winter."
    Second: Peddling Luo Longji's poison and opposing the Party's leadership. After quoting Fei Xiaotong's theory, the article goes on to quote Luo Longji's theory: "...Mr. Luo Longji once said: Old intellectuals are influenced by a set of traditional concepts of 'scholars' from the old Chinese society. The saying 'A scholar dies for his confidant' can represent the characteristics of some intellectuals." This passage asks the Party to abandon its ideological leadership over intellectuals, to have "leading cadres" "correct this understanding." What they call correction is what we call distortion, wanting the Party to cater to the capitalist and feudalist ideas of intellectuals, and to abandon ideological criticism and ideological struggle. Unfortunately, the "leading cadres" did not act according to the ideas put forward by the rightists.
    Third: Using the excuse of a wall to stir up discord between the Party and the masses. "Many people also mentioned that there is an insurmountable wall between leaders and the led, and between Party members and non-Party members. This is also the result of dogmatism and bureaucracy." -- "Many people," where did these "many" come from? I have heard and seen "many people" raise the issue of a wall between the Party and the masses, but maliciously exaggerating the wall as an "insurmountable wall" has only been heard from a very small number of rightists. The people have never said that the "wall" is "insurmountable" because some contradictions between the Party and the masses are not antagonistic contradictions and can be resolved with the formula of "unity - criticism - unity." The way this article puts it is simply trying to expand the contradictions between the Party and the masses into antagonistic ones.
    However, one thing is true: there is indeed an "insurmountable" wall between the Party and the rightists. Even if the rightists want to tear it down, they will never succeed. The higher and stronger this wall is, the better. The so-called "many people," could it be the very small number of rightists? Then the wrong vocabulary was used.
    Fourth: Negating everything under the slogan of anti-dogmatism. There were many shortcomings in past work, some due to dogmatism, and some not due to dogmatism. This article not only attributes everything to dogmatism, but also expands "dogmatism" to be a fundamentally important factor in past work. Look: "White waves like mountains, how can we cross!" "Dogmatism has made education mechanical." "Dogmatists... once made it impossible for many scientific departments to survive, and many people with specialized skills were forced to change careers and not engage in their proper professions." "The dogmatists' crude style of 'knocking people dead with one blow' is the most terrible. A book or an article is criticized, which is equivalent to 'being pushed out of the Meridian Gate for execution,'...". There is also "dogmatism..." "dogmatism..." In short, the ideological root of all problems is always dogmatism.
    I won't argue much with this point. The facts are all there and can be verified. I just want to say one sentence: The point that "dogmatism has made education mechanical" is, like "Renmin University is a large nest of dogmatism," trying to fundamentally negate the Marxist ideological guidance in our schools. The "New Observer" reporter may retort: I have merely "truly" collected the opinions of various people during the great blooming and contending, why criticize me? Turning various scattered and individual opinions into a report through processing, the choices and judgments in it reflect the author's point of view. Collecting and organizing the rightists' remarks and saying that they are the remarks of all intellectuals is one of the rightists' weapons in attacking, using watermelon seeds to represent watermelons. This "collection" is precisely what the "correspondent" sees as "truth."
    Fifth: Inciting wavering elements within the Party to "revolt," attempting to undermine the Party's organization from within, and vainly hoping to make the Party disintegrate in the face of the rightists' rampant attacks. Listen to the voice of the instigator: "The vast majority of intellectuals have not only thawed out, but are also surging like a tide. However, there are still people who have not thawed out. For example, certain individual leading cadres in some areas, certain Party member intellectuals."
    Party members are unwilling to "thaw out"! This is truly an unpleasant thing. According to the hopes of the "New Observer" reporter, in the face of the rightists' "surging like a tide" attacks, it would be best if Party member intellectuals completely "thawed out" and also participated in this "tide," abandoning the position of a Party member, following behind the rightists to "expose the darkness," and turning from "silent" to shouting anti-Party and anti-socialist slogans. Then the Party would not be the Party, and the rightists would completely seize the leadership of the intellectuals...
    However, such an attempt has also failed. Although a small number of Party members "thawed out" from communist ideology in the face of the "surging like a tide" attacks and became internal collaborators of the rightists, falling into the anti-Party trap, the vast majority of Party members have stood firm. No matter how fiercely the rightists burn, they have not "thawed out." Now they, together with the working class and all patriotic intellectuals, are giving the rightists a head-on blow.
    Writing these few points is enough, right? It is clear enough who the "New Observer" article is speaking for. "New Observer" is one of the literary journals led by the Writers Association. Newspapers are tools of class struggle. The purpose of writing these articles is to hope that this weapon can be held in the hands of the proletariat rather than in the hands of the bourgeoisie. This issue should be clear from the two publications "Wenhui Bao" and "New Observer." (Night of July 11)

### “新观察”放出的一支毒箭

    “新观察”放出的一支毒箭
    姚文元
    5月16日的“新观察”上，有一篇“一个月来‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’情况小记”，题为“蓓蕾满园乍开时”，作者为“本刊记者”，登在第一页。
    用一句简单的话来概括：这篇文章是向党进攻的一支毒箭。右派分子许多主要论点，都被吸收在这篇“小记”（？）中了。现在摘出几条来看一看：
    第一条：鼓吹费孝通的“早春天气”的错误论调，“费孝通先生的感受，是有一定的代表意义的。因为，‘早春’确实说明了知识分子当时的心情。既然是早春的气候，就不免寒暖无常。……”
    中国绝大多数爱国的知识分子，早就处在时代的春天之中了。从黑暗的旧中国到光明的新中国，就沐浴在春天的阳光之中。他们根本不会以为解放以后的六七年时间是“严冬”，而现在才是“早春”。这所谓“早春气候”，其实是比较广泛地“代表”了知识分子中右派的心理状态的，他们以为，现在是反党反社会主义“气候”最适宜的时候了，他们竟狂妄地估计右派的“春天”要来了，但是信心又不充分。心中是又喜又惧，喜的是现在大鸣大放，可以放手发动进攻，惧的是共产党和工人阶级是不是会还击，心中确有些“寒暖无常”。所以造出一个“早春气候”，想以此来解除拥护社会主义的人反击右派的发言权，如果谁要反击，就是从“早春”退到“严冬”。——这巧计是颇为毒辣的，在没有揭穿之前，确能迷惑不少人。但是他们落得一场空欢喜，迎接右派分子的并不是“早春”而是“严冬”。
    第二条：贩卖罗隆基的毒药，反对党的领导。文章在引用了费孝通的理论之后接着就引用罗隆基的理论：“……罗隆基先生曾经说：在老知识分子身上，有着中国旧社会中‘士’的一套传统观念的影响。‘士为知己者死’这句话，是能够代表一部分知识分子的特点的。”这段话就是要党能够放弃对知识分子的思想领导，要“领导干部”“端正这个认识”，他们所谓端正，就是我们所谓端歪，要党去迁就知识分子中的资本主义和封建主义的思想，放弃思想批判和思想斗争。可惜“领导干部”并未依照右派出的主意去办。
    第三条：借口有墙，挑拨党群关系。“许多人还提到领导与被领导之间，党与非党之间存在着一堵不可逾越的墙，这也是教条主义和官僚主义的结果。”——“许多人”，这“许多”两字从何而来？我听到过、看到过“许多人”提出过党群关系之间有墙，但是，恶意地把墙夸大地称做“不可逾越的墙”，却只是在极少数右派分子口中听到。人民从来没有说过“墙”是“不可逾越”的，因为党群之间某些矛盾并非对抗性的矛盾，是可以用“团结——批评——团结”的公式去解决的。像这篇文章的说法，不过是想把党群的矛盾扩大为对抗性的罢了。
    然而有一点倒是真的：党同右派分子之间确有一道“不可逾越”的墙，就是右派分子想拆，也休想拆掉，这道墙是越高越好、越坚越好的。所谓“许多人”，莫非就是极少数右派分子么？那可用错了词汇了。
    第四条：在反教条主义的口号下否定一切。过去各项工作中有许多缺点，有的是由于教条主义，有的并不是由于教条主义。这篇文章中不但把一切归诸教条主义，还把“教条主义”扩大为在过去某些工作中起根本作用的因素。你看：“白浪如山那可渡！”“教条主义使教育机械化了。”“教条主义者……曾经使不少科学部门无法生存，不少学有专长的人被迫改行，不务正业。”“教条主义者‘一棍子打死’的粗暴作风最可怕。一本书，一篇文章被批判了，就等于‘推出午门斩首’，……”。还有“教条主义……”“教条主义……”总之一切问题的思想根源总是教条主义。
    这一条不多作辩驳了，事实俱在，可以查证。我只想说一句：“教条主义使教育机械化了”这一点，同“人民大学是教条主义的大蜂窝”一样，都是想从根本上否定我们学校中的马克思主义思想指导的。新观察的记者也许可以反驳说：我不过把大鸣大放中各种人的意见“真实地”集中起来罢了，为什么要批评我呢？把各种分散的、个别的意见经过加工而变成一篇报道，其中的取舍褒贬就反映了作者的观点。把右派的言论集中整理并说成是全体知识分子的言论，这种以瓜子代表西瓜的战术，也是右派进攻的武器之一。这个“集中”，正是“本刊记者”眼光中的所谓“真实”。
    第五条：鼓动党内不坚定的分子“起义”，企图从内部来破坏党的组织，妄想使党在右派的猖狂进攻面前瓦解。且听一下挑拨者的声音：“绝大多数知识分子，不仅解了冻，而且已汹涌如潮。然而，现在毕竟还是有着尚未解冻的人。譬如某些地区的个别领导干部，某些党员知识分子。”
    党员竟不肯“解冻”！这真是一件不太愉快的事。照新观察记者的希望，在右派分子“汹涌如潮”的进攻面前，最好是党员知识分子完全“解冻”，也参加到这个“潮”头中来，放弃一个党员的立场，跟在右派的屁股后面来“揭露黑暗”，从“沉默不语”转向高呼反党反社会主义的口号，于是党不成党，右派分子就完全夺取了知识分子中的领导权……。
    然而这样的企图也是落空了。虽然有少数党员在“汹涌如潮”的进攻面前从共产主义思想中“解冻”出来，变成了右派分子的内应，落到了反党的陷坑中去，但绝大多数党员都站稳了立场，不管右派火烧得多么厉害，也没有“解冻”。现在他们同工人阶级和一切爱国知识分子一起，向右派分子迎头痛击了。
    写了这几条，也够了吧！新观察这篇文章在替什么人说话，是够明白的了。新观察是作协领导的文艺性刊物之一，报刊是阶级斗争的工具。我写这些文章的用意，就是希望这个武器能够掌握在无产阶级手中而不是掌握在资产阶级手中。这一个问题现在从“文汇报”和“新观察”两个刊物上看，应当可以明白了。  （7月11日夜）
