Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Paris: The French economy is facing an extremely serious crisis, and the continuation of the Algerian War will plunge France's economic crisis into an irreparable situation.

From January 1956 to the end of June this year, France's foreign exchange reserves decreased by a total of 1.6 billion US dollars. By the end of June this year, foreign exchange reserves were only 385 million US dollars (the recognized danger point is 900 million US dollars). Sources say that by mid-July, France's foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted. France's debt to the European Payments Union in June is expected to exceed 80 million US dollars. Since October last year, France has had to gradually use the 265 million US dollars it withdrew from the International Monetary Fund. On May 29, the French government overdrawn 80 billion francs (more than 220 million US dollars) from the Bank of France. At the end of June, the French government requested the Bank of France to deliver gold worth 100 billion francs and another 300 billion francs in cash to the government within three years.

France's fiscal deficit in 1957 reached 1.4 trillion francs. Because France is engaged in a large-scale colonial war in Algeria, which costs more than 1 billion francs per day on average, military expenditures account for the largest share of the budget. The military budget for 1957 is 1 trillion francs.

According to United Press International, France's current situation is the most difficult of all Western European countries. France has serious inflation. The amount of banknotes issued has reached a huge number of 3,119 billion francs. The total tax revenue in 1957 reached 3,429 billion francs (23% of national income). The amount of public debt issued had increased to 5.3 trillion francs by the end of 1956.

The increasingly worsening trade deficit is suffocating France. In the past eighteen months, the average monthly trade deficit has exceeded 100 million US dollars. The deficit in May this year reached 150 million US dollars. Although domestic investment and industrial production in France have increased to some extent in the past few years, the import of raw materials and fuels has increased even more. The total value of French imports in June was 194.9 billion francs. Since the French government implemented strict import restrictions in mid-June, although the import of fuel and grain decreased somewhat compared with May, the import of textile raw materials, precious metals, and non-ferrous metals increased. The continued deterioration of the trade deficit will accelerate the collapse of the French economy.

With the recent increase in fuel prices and the result of increasing taxes by 170 billion francs to fund the Algerian War, the prices of French daily necessities and industrial products have skyrocketed. The prices of some foods have increased by two to three times.

### 阿尔及利亚泥沼愈陷愈深  法国站在经济危机的边缘

    阿尔及利亚泥沼愈陷愈深
    法国站在经济危机的边缘
    新华社18日讯  巴黎消息：法国经济正面临极其严重的危机，而阿尔及利亚战争的继续将使法国的经济危机陷于不可挽救的境地。
    从1956年1月起到今年6月底，法国的外汇储备一共减少了十六亿美元。到今年6月底，外汇储备只剩下三亿八千五百万美元（公认的危险点是九亿美元）。有消息说，到7月中旬，法国的外汇储备就要空竭了。6月份法国在欧洲支付同盟中的债款预计要超过八千万美元，从去年10月份开始，法国就不得不陆续动用从国际货币基金中提取的二亿六千五百万美元。法国政府在5月29日曾向法兰西银行透支了八百亿法郎（二亿二千多万美元），到6月底法国政府又要求法兰西银行在三年内交付政府价值一千亿法郎的黄金和另外三千亿法郎的现款。
    1957年法国的财政赤字达到了一万四千亿法郎。由于法国在阿尔及利亚从事规模巨大的殖民战争，平均每天得花费十亿法郎以上，所以预算中军事开支所占的份额最大。1957年的军事预算是一万亿法郎。
    据合众社报道，法国目前的处境是所有西欧国家中最困难的。法国有着严重的通货膨胀。纸币发行额已经达到三万一千一百九十亿法郎的巨数。1957年的税收总额达到了三万四千二百九十亿法郎（占国民收入的23％）。公债发行额到1956年底已增加到五万三千亿法郎。
    日益恶化的贸易逆差压得法国无法喘气。在过去十八个月中，平均每月的贸易亏空要超过一亿美元。今年5月份的亏空达到了一亿五千万美元。尽管在过去几年中，法国的国内投资和工业生产有某些增加，但是原料和燃料的进口增加得更多。6月份法国的进口总值是一千九百四十九亿法郎。自从法国政府6月中旬对进口采取严格限制的紧急措施后，虽然燃料和粮食的进口比5月份减少了一些，可是纺织业原料、贵重金属和非铁金属的进口却有了增加。贸易逆差的继续恶化将加速法国经济的崩溃。
    随着最近燃料价格的提高和为阿尔及利亚战争拨款而增税一千七百亿法郎的结果，使得法国的日用品和工业品的价格飞涨。有些食品的价格上涨了一倍至三倍。
