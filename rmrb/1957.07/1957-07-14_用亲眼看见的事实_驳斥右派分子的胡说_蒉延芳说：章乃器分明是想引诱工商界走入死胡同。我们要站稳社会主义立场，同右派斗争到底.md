Use Facts Seen with My Own Eyes to Refute the Nonsense of Rightist Elements
Kui Yanfang says: Zhang Naiqi Clearly Intends to Lead the Industrial and Commercial Circles into a Dead End. We Must Stand Firm on the Socialist Position and Fight the Rightists to the End.

I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Chief Procurator Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. I am willing to provide my utmost effort to thoroughly implement the major tasks proposed in these reports.

In May of this year, I inspected the fishery production and the lives of fishermen in the Ningbo and Zhoushan areas of Zhejiang Province, visiting a total of three fishery production cooperatives. I felt very excited because I had ample time to chat with many fisherman brothers and sisters. I am an old man with ordinary knowledge, and the broad masses of working people, like me, do not understand profound theories. However, when we talked together, we had a common language and understanding. Everyone understood a simple and clear fundamental truth: without the leadership of the Communist Party, we could not have turned ourselves around, and the country could not have turned itself around either. But the reactionary rightist elements are actually opening their eyes and telling lies, undermining socialism, and slandering the superiority of the socialist system. I am willing to report to the conference what I have seen and heard with my own eyes, and use ironclad facts to shatter the shameless lies of the rightist elements.

The rightist elements say, "The socialist system is not better than the capitalist system, and the people's living standards have not improved after liberation." This is completely turning right and wrong on its head. In 1956, the fisheries in the Zhoushan area were basically organized into advanced cooperatives. The number of fishing households joining the cooperatives accounted for 97.7 percent of the total number of fishing households in the area. The output in 1956 increased by 26.8 percent compared to 1955. Among the 174 advanced cooperatives in the area, 99 percent increased production and 95 percent increased income. The average accumulation per cooperative was 18,200 yuan, and the average annual income per person was 530 yuan, an increase of 20 percent compared to 1955. The highest was the Houtou Village Fishery Production Cooperative, with an average annual income of 1,200 yuan per person. In the Ant Township of Taohua District, Putuo County, 2,076 out of 2,564 people were engaged in fishing, and women universally participated in production. In 1956, the average net income per person was 577 yuan. The planned average income for 1957 is 769 yuan. The average annual income per fisherman in Putuo County was only 54 yuan in 1951, 119 yuan in 1952, 479 yuan in 1953, 180 yuan in 1954 (due to a disaster), 540 yuan in 1955, and 564 yuan in 1956. The Wulong Township Fishery Production Cooperative on the Shengsi Islands had 658 households in the entire township, all of whom joined the cooperative. The average income per member in 1956 was 732 yuan, with the highest being 1,500 yuan. These figures fully demonstrate that the living standards of fishermen are improving year by year. I also personally saw women wearing woolen clothes and walking happily on the streets in their spare time. I heard that everyone has at least two woolen sweaters in winter. Before liberation, fishermen had low incomes, and many people liked to gamble, often ending up with empty pockets and heavy debts. After liberation, not only did income increase, but gambling was also eradicated, thus constantly improving living standards. It is no accident that I saw fishermen living comfortably.

I inspected Dinghai County in 1955. After a year, the construction situation in this place was very different. Reservoirs have been built throughout the entire area. The state invested 480,000 yuan, and 130 reservoirs have been completed, with about 50 still under construction. They not only supply drinking water to the fishermen and facilitate irrigation of farmland, but also allow some townships to develop freshwater fish farming. The sanitation and cleanliness work in the cities has also been done very well, and men and women residents dressed neatly and cleanly can be seen all over the streets. Before liberation, there were only over 70 primary school students in the Ant Township of Taohua District, Putuo County, while now there are over 400 students in one primary school, over 60 people studying in middle school, and one person studying in university. The township has established a club and a two-story steel and concrete auditorium. The previous 20 percent of thatched huts have now been basically eliminated, and the roads are paved with large stone slabs. There is also a clinic. A reporter from the Soviet "Pravda" visited this township and praised it as a "Little Soviet." The number of lighthouses erected on the reefs is increasing year by year, and the lights shine in all directions at night, facilitating navigation. Ships are generally equipped with radios that can receive weather reports and emergency alerts, allowing them to take measures to prevent storms and reduce accidental losses. Many ships have added new fishing nets, thereby increasing production. The number of motorized sailing boats is also increasing year by year.

The above are all concrete examples of "fishermen turning themselves around" that I have seen and heard with my own eyes, fully demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system. In the face of such ironclad facts, everyone has received a lesson in socialist education. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the government, our industrial and commercial circles have accepted socialist transformation and participated in socialist construction, and a considerable number of people have greatly improved their ideological understanding. We have already expressed our determination to take the socialist road and support the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party with practical actions. Now we are all working hard to build socialism, and the Communist Party's rectification campaign is also to build socialism better. However, rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi, driven by madness, are trying to take the capitalist road of return in an organized and planned way, attempting to drag our industrial and commercial circles backward. This is a serious test for each of us, testing whether we support socialism or oppose socialism, whether we accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party or oppose the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. We must stand firm on the socialist position in order to distinguish between right and wrong and distinguish between black and white; we must build socialism under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and this great goal should not be vague or ambiguous. Without the Communist Party, socialism cannot be built. We will never allow anyone to slander the working class and the Communist Party, or to undermine socialism. While continuing to help the Communist Party rectify, we must resolutely and ruthlessly counterattack all anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightist elements' words and actions.

The reactionary remarks of rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi once had a market in our industrial and commercial circles. They paralyzed us, relaxed our transformation, provoked us to resist accepting the leadership of the working class and the Party, deceived us into leaving the socialist road, becoming prisoners of capitalism, and engaging in capitalism, which is clearly inducing us to enter a dead end, which is extremely harmful to us. With the deepening of the struggle against the rightist elements, their true colors and sinister intentions have been fully exposed to us. We must further analyze and refute their reactionary remarks, thoroughly expose the inside story of their anti-socialist activities, expose all the rightist elements in the industrial and commercial circles, and resolutely fight them to the end. Minister Li Weihan said that this is a struggle between two roads. We should keep this sentence firmly in mind. We should be even more clear that only by sincerely accepting the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party and taking the socialist road is the only correct path. The rightist elements are dangerous and vicious, while the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party is wise and correct, and the power of the people is incomparably powerful. The rampant attacks of the rightist elements are now being strongly counterattacked by us, and they are undergoing a shameful process of failure. From decline to death, concentrating our forces to annihilate them will be our most important task at present. While crushing all the foolish actions of the rightist elements, our country will move from victory to greater victory on the socialist transformation, socialist construction, and other fronts!

    用亲眼看见的事实  驳斥右派分子的胡说
    蒉延芳说：章乃器分明是想引诱工商界走入死胡同。我们要站稳社会主义立场，同右派斗争到底
    我衷心拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告，完全同意李、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长所作的各项报告。我愿为彻底实现这些报告所提出的重大任务而提供最大的努力。
    今年五月，我视察了浙江省宁波和舟山地区的渔业生产情况和渔民的生活情况，一共视察了三个渔业生产合作社。我感觉非常兴奋，因为有了充裕的时间和许多渔民兄弟姊妹谈谈家常。我是一个知识平凡的老年人，广大的劳动人民和我一样，不懂得高深的理论。但是，我们在一道谈话，有共同的语言和体会，大家懂得一条简单明了的根本道理：没有共产党的领导，我们翻不了身，国家也翻不了身。可是反动的右派分子竟然睁着眼睛说瞎话，破坏社会主义，诬蔑社会主义制度的优越性。我愿把亲眼看见、亲耳听到的向大会汇报，用铁一般的事实来粉碎右派分子的无耻谰言。
    右派分子说：“社会主义制度不比资本主义制度好，解放后人民生活水平没有提高。”这完全是颠倒是非的胡说。一九五六年舟山地区的渔业，基本上都已组成高级合作社，入社渔户占全区总渔户的百分之九十七点七，一九五六年的产量比一九五五年增加百分之二十六点八。全区一百七十四个高级社中，百分之九十九增加了生产，百分之九十五增加了收入，平均每个社积累一万八千二百元，平均每人全年收入五百三十元，比一九五五年增加百分之二十，最高的后头村渔业生产合作社，平均每人全年收入一千二百元。普陀县桃花区蚂蚁乡二千五百六十四人中有二千零七十六人从事渔业，妇女普遍投入生产。一九五六年平均每人纯收入五百七十七元。一九五七年的计划平均收入是七百六十九元。普陀全县渔民平均每人每年收入一九五一年只有五十四元，一九五二年一百一十九元，一九五三年四百七十九元，一九五四年一百八十元（因为有灾情），一九五五年五百四十元，一九五六年五百六十四元。嵊泗列岛上的五龙乡渔业生产合作社，全乡六百五十八户，全部入社，社员一九五六年平均每人收入七百三十二元，最高的一千五百元。这些数字充分说明渔民的生活水平年年提高。我还亲眼看到妇女们在工余之暇，穿着呢绒衣服，愉快地走在街上。听说冬季每人至少有绒线衣衫二件。解放前，渔民收入少，不少人还喜欢赌博，经常袋里空空，负债累累。解放后，不仅收入增加，赌博也根绝了，因而生活水平得到不断的提高，我看到渔民们丰衣足食，绝不是偶然的。
    我在一九五五年到定海县视察过，时隔一年，这个地方的建设情况大不相同了。全专区普遍建造水库，国家投资四十八万元，已完工的一百三十只，未完工的五十只左右，不仅可以供应渔民食用，便利灌溉农田，而且有些乡还发展了淡水养鱼，城市的卫生清洁工作也做得很好，满街看到衣履齐整干净的男女居民。普陀县桃花区蚂蚁乡解放前只有小学生七十余人，而现在的一所小学，有学生四百余人，在中学读书的六十余人，在大学读书的一人。乡里建立俱乐部一所，还有二层钢骨水泥造的大礼堂一所。过去百分之二十的茅草屋，现已基本消除，道路由大石板铺成。并设有诊疗所。苏联“真理报”一位记者曾到这个乡视察。称赞它是“小苏联”。在礁石上耸立的灯塔的数目，一年比一年增加，夜间灯光四射，便利行舟。船上一般地都备有无线电，可以收听气象报告和紧急警报，采取防避风暴的措施，减少意外损失。不少的船都增加了新式渔网，因而增加了产量。机帆船的数量也年有增加。
    以上都是我亲眼看到、亲耳听到的“渔民翻身”的具体事例，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。在这样铁一般的事实前面，任何人都上了社会主义教育的一课。我们工商界在党和政府的培养教育下，接受了社会主义改造，参加了社会主义建设，相当大的一部分人在思想认识上有了很大的提高。我们已经用实际行动表示我们坚决走社会主义的路，拥护工人阶级和共产党的领导。现在我们大家都在努力建设社会主义，共产党整风也是为了把社会主义建设得更好。但是，章乃器等右派分子丧心病狂、有组织、有计划地想走资本主义的回头路，企图拉我们工商界倒退。这对我们每一个人是一种严重的考验，考验我们是拥护社会主义呢？还是反社会主义呢？是接受工人阶级和共产党的领导呢？还是反对工人阶级和共产党的领导呢？我们必须站稳社会主义立场，才能明辨是非，分清黑白；我们要在工人阶级和共产党领导下建设社会主义，这一个伟大的目标是不应该含混模糊的。没有共产党，就建设不了社会主义。我们绝不容许任何人来污蔑工人阶级和共产党，来破坏社会主义，我们在继续帮助共产党整风的同时，要坚决地、无情地对一切反党、反人民、反社会主义右派分子的言论及行动进行反击。
    章乃器等右派分子的反动言论在我们工商界中曾经有过市场，他们麻醉我们放松改造，挑拨我们抗拒接受工人阶级和党的领导，欺骗我们离开社会主义道路，做资本主义的俘虏，搞资本主义，分明是引诱我们走进死胡同，这对我们是有极大的害处的。随着反右派分子斗争的深入展开，他们的本来面目和阴毒企图，在我们面前充分暴露出来了。我们还须进一步分析和驳斥他们的反动言论，彻底揭露他们的反社会主义活动的底细，揭发工商界中所有的右派分子，坚决和他们斗争到底。李维汉部长说，这是两条道路的斗争。我们应当紧紧记住这句话，我们应当更明白，只有诚心诚意接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，走社会主义的路，才是唯一正确的道路。右派分子是凶险的，毒辣的，而工人阶级和共产党的领导是英明正确的，人民的力量是无比强大的。右派分子的猖狂进攻，现在正在遭受我们的强有力的反击，他们正在可耻的失败的过程中。从没落到死亡，聚而歼之将是我们目前最重要的工作。在粉碎一切右派分子的蠢动的同时，我们国家将在社会主义改造、社会主义建设和其他各个战线上，从胜利走向更大的胜利！
