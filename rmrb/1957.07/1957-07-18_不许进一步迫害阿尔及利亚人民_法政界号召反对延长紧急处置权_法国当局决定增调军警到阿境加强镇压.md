Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Paris — The French National Assembly began discussing on the evening of July 16 a bill to extend the government's emergency powers in Algeria and to expand the exercise of these powers to French territory. The discussion on this bill will continue for three days.

Under the so-called "emergency powers," the police can conduct arbitrary searches, detain suspects for long periods of time, and conduct sudden searches of suspects' homes at any time.

The "emergency powers" were authorized by the French government in March 1956 after coercing the National Assembly to exercise them in Algeria.

Prior to this, the National Assembly's Interior Committee had twice rejected the part of the bill that called for extending emergency powers to French territory in order to carry out brutal suppression of Algerians residing in France.

This bill of the French government has caused serious unrest in the country. Many members of the French National Assembly and well-known figures from various parties are also concerned.

The National Peace Council issued a statement calling for mass rallies and gatherings, and sending delegations and telegrams to Parliament to oppose the bill. Also calling for a struggle to reject this bill are the Seine Peace Movement Committee, various peace movement groups, the "New Left League," the "People's Liberation Movement," and the Seine-et-Oise Communist Party and Radical Socialist Party Alliance.

The French Communist Party firmly opposes the emergency powers proposed by the government. "L'Humanité" calls on all parties to unite and form a united front to defend freedom.

The French League for Human Rights recently passed a resolution at a conference in March, condemning the French army's "increasingly violent acts in Algeria" and condemning the French government's plan to use special powers on French territory. The League for Human Rights also called for a peaceful settlement of the Algerian issue.

According to Parisian newspapers, a group of paratroopers who returned to Paris from Algeria to participate in the July 14th French National Day military review conducted a real "hunt" for North African workers in some districts of Paris on the 15th. In places such as the Place de la Bastille, Boulevard Barbès, and the Gare du Nord, they beat any Arabs they encountered on the street. Dozens of Arabs were injured. "L'Humanité" pointed out that the police completely condoned this lawless behavior.

Algerian news: The French Resident Minister in Algeria, Lacoste, announced on the 16th that the French government has decided to transfer French troops stationed in Morocco and Tunisia to Algeria. In addition, police will be dispatched from France to Algeria to strengthen the suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement.

The French military court in Algeria sentenced ten Algerians to death on the 15th for participating in the liberation struggle, including two women—one twenty years old and the other only nineteen years old.

"Le Parisien Libéré" reported that French authorities also arrested four Algerian communists who participated in the liberation struggle.

    不许进一步迫害阿尔及利亚人民
    法政界号召反对延长紧急处置权
    法国当局决定增调军警到阿境加强镇压
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：巴黎消息：法国国民议会7月16日晚间开始讨论关于延长政府在阿尔及利亚的紧急处置权并且把这些权力的行使扩大到法国本土的法案。关于这一法案的讨论将继续三天。
    根据所谓“紧急处置权”，警察可以进行任意的搜查，可以长时间拘押受嫌疑的人和随时对受嫌疑者的家宅进行突然搜查。
      “紧急处置权”是法国政府在1956年3月要挟国民议会授权在阿尔及利亚行使的。
    在这以前，国民议会内政委员会曾经两次拒绝了这个法案中要求把紧急处置权扩大到法国本土，以便对居住在法国的阿尔及利亚人实行残酷镇压的部分。
    法国政府的这一法案在国内引起了严重的不安。法国国民议会的许多议员和各党派的知名人士也都感到忧虑。
    全国和平理事会发表声明，号召举行群众大会和集会，并且派代表团和拍电报去议会反对这个法案。号召为否决这个法案而斗争的还有塞纳省和平运动委员会，各和平运动团体，“新左翼联盟”，“人民解放运动”以及塞纳—瓦斯省共产党和激进社会党联盟。
    法国共产党坚决反对政府提出的这种紧急处置权。“人道报”号召一切党派团结起来，结成统一战线来保卫自由。
    法国人权联盟最近在马拱市举行的代表大会上通过决议，谴责法军“在阿尔及利亚的横暴行为变本加厉”，谴责法国政府在法国本土使用特别全权的计划。人权联盟还要求和平调解阿尔及利亚问题。
    据巴黎报纸报道，从阿尔及利亚回到巴黎参加7月14日法国国庆节军事检阅的一批伞兵15日在巴黎一些区里对北非劳动者进行了真正的“猎捕”。在巴士底广场、巴比塞大街、北火车站等一些地方，他们在路上殴打他们碰到的任何阿拉伯人。有好几十个阿拉伯人受伤。“人道报”指出，警察完全放纵这种无法无天的行为。
    阿尔及利亚消息：法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长拉戈斯特16日宣布，法国政府已经决定把摩洛哥和突尼斯的法国驻军增调到阿尔及利亚，此外还将从法国本土增派警察到阿尔及利亚去，以便加强镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。
    阿尔及利亚的法国军事法庭15日以参加解放斗争的罪名判处十个阿尔及利亚人死刑，其中有两个妇女——一个二十岁，另一个才十九岁。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”报道，法国当局还逮捕了四个参加解放斗争的阿尔及利亚共产党人。
