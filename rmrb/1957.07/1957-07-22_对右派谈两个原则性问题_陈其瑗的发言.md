I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng, President Dong, and Procurator-General Zhang.

"Communists are made of special materials" is not wrong

Allow me, as someone who has cooperated with Communists for a long time and has been educated and reformed by the Party for eight years, to speak to the rightists and those with right-leaning ideas on two issues of principle.

I. Zhang Naiqi said that Stalin's statement, "Communists are made of special materials," is the root of privileged thinking. I oppose this statement. It should be affirmed that Stalin's statement was not wrong. Stalin's intention was nothing more than "to encourage Communists to have Marxist-Leninist thought, to have the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people." (Representative Lu Dingyi's speech at this conference)

Communists are made of special materials, and this was true in the long period of democratic revolutionary struggle, it is true in socialist construction today, and it will be true in the future construction of communism, because the arduous work of building socialism and communism is no easier than the democratic revolutionary struggle. Looking back, the enemies riding on the backs of our people were so powerful and so brutal. Without the successive waves of tens of thousands of "special materials," the revolutionary struggle could not have achieved victory. Especially without the "special materials" who accepted orders in times of crisis, were unyielding until death, and dedicated themselves to the lofty ideals of mankind, the red flag could never have been held high amidst the white terror. At present, China is still in a situation of being a large but poor country with a backward culture. Without "special materials" who wholeheartedly serve the people, who overcome difficulties with tenacious labor, and who plan for the benefit of the people with infinite loyalty and great enthusiasm, it is difficult to imagine that socialist happiness will fall from the sky.

During the Great Revolution, I was moved by the words and deeds of the Communists I came into contact with or worked with, such as Yun Daiying (Chief Instructor of the Whampoa Military Academy), Deng Zhongxia (Secretary-General of the Hong Kong and Guangdong Strike Committee), Xiao Chunu (Dean of Studies at the Guangdong Peasant Movement Institute), Xu Suyun (Secretary of the Central Overseas Department), Yang Pao'an (Minister of Organization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee), Liu Ersong (Minister of Workers of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee), Fang Zhimin (Minister of Peasants of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee), Yang Yin (Chairman of the Anti-Revolutionary Committee of the Guangzhou Commune), etc. I believe they were all made of special materials. During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I went to Korea, and I was even more moved by the heroic sacrifices of the "special materials" in the Chinese People's Volunteers, such as Huang Jiguang and Wu Xianhua, who created earth-shattering achievements. In recent years, in the struggle against floods and in rescue operations, many people made of special materials have demonstrated heroic acts of sacrifice, saving others at the expense of themselves. I have also been to many factories, mines, government offices, schools, and organizations, where there are people made of special materials taking the lead everywhere. I reaffirm that Communists are made of special materials, they are the essence of our nation, the embodiment of truth, and the hope of mankind.

"Special materials" are not born that way. Communists do not become special materials overnight. They must undergo Party education, long-term study, and be tempered in work and struggle. Only after being tempered a hundred times can they become steel. Non-Party members can also become Communists after being tempered into special materials.

"Special materials" did not appear today. Throughout history, many patriotic heroes and steadfast and loyal people have made commendable and indelible contributions under different social and historical conditions, raised national integrity, and promoted social and historical progress. For example, Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, and Shi Kefa in the feudal era; Tan Sitong and Tang Caichang in the era of the Hundred Days' Reform; Lin Juemin, Fang Shengdong, Qiu Jin, Xu Xilin, and even the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang before and after the Xinhai Revolution, were all people who could live when they could, could die when they could, sacrificing their lives for righteousness without hesitation. Communists have inherited the excellent traditions of our nation and carried them forward!

Of course, due to historical limitations, the "special materials" of any past era are essentially different from today's "special materials"—the vanguard of the working class—in terms of historical tasks. The historical mission of today's "special materials" is to eliminate the system of human exploitation, promote human society to a higher stage, and establish a socialist and even communist society. Doing things that predecessors have never done before, the missions undertaken by the special materials produced in the feudal era and capitalist society cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

Zhang Naiqi's opposition to the statement "Communists are made of special materials" is malicious. His intention is essentially to oppose Marxist-Leninist thought, to oppose the idea of the working class vanguard wholeheartedly serving the people, to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and essentially to oppose the people.

Saying "The Principle of People's Livelihood is Socialism" can only create confusion in thought

II. Many fallacies of those with right-leaning ideas that have emerged during the assistance to the Communist Party's rectification campaign have already received well-deserved and stern rebuttals, and I do not want to say more. As a former follower of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I would like to express my personal different views on the recent argument that "The Principle of People's Livelihood is Socialism."

Thirty-five years ago, I was encouraged by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies of "Alliance with Russia, Alliance with the Communist Party, and Assistance to Workers and Peasants" in his later years, and resolutely joined the Kuomintang of China during the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. I am very clear that the Three Great Policies and "The Principle of People's Livelihood is Socialism" are two different things. As Comrade He Xiangning said, there were indeed left, middle, and right factions in the Kuomintang at that time. Regarding the Three Great Policies, the left faction supported them, the middle faction speculated, and the right faction opposed them. The first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation broke down because Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and many people who adhered to the Three Great Policies were forced into exile or were slaughtered. This is an extremely painful lesson. It should also be pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek and his strategists once used the slogan "The Principle of People's Livelihood is Socialism" to establish the "Sun Yat-senism Society" at the Whampoa Military Academy, set up an anti-communist banner, and split a good revolutionary team. Later, they continued to use this slogan to create ideological confusion and appease people. Today, socialism has become a living reality, and the people have firmly followed the Communist Party on the Marxist-Leninist road to socialism. Mr. Sun Yat-sen is a revolutionary pioneer, and this has been established. The historical significance of the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen cannot be denied by anyone. The Chinese people have inherited the excellent revolutionary traditions and unfinished achievements of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the predecessors, and have promoted them to a new stage. If we still emphasize "The Principle of People's Livelihood is Socialism" today, besides creating confusion in thought, it is not necessarily beneficial to the glory and greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The progressive figures of the Kuomintang have consistently inherited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies, accepted the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and devoted their efforts to socialist construction today, worthy of being followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the essence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary theory has long become the common property of the Chinese people, and has been inherited by the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary democratic parties. A few people do not need to regard themselves as orthodox successors!

When the older generation of democratic figures are advancing on the road to socialism, some are not yet accustomed to new things, and some are nostalgic for the past. After learning, researching, and thinking, some "benefit from it and act accordingly," while others "reluctantly act accordingly." This is very natural and understandable. However, the thorough transformation of thought is a long-term matter. Although some people have already entered the stage of socialist revolution, they still retain some bourgeois ideological consciousness, and even some feudal residual ideas. This is an important factor in the emergence of incorrect remarks in this assistance to the Communist Party's rectification campaign, and it proves that it is very necessary for us to accept the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to carry out ideological reform. I believe that in the current serious ideological struggle, we must make our minds work, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and distinguish right from wrong. We must resolutely oppose the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-proletarian dictatorship, and anti-people remarks and actions of the rightists, and draw a clear line with them. At the same time, we must also wage ideological struggle with people with right-leaning ideas. Their seemingly correct but essentially anti-Marxist-Leninist revisionist and reformist remarks are hindering the progress of socialist construction and confusing people. The above example is one such instance, and we must constantly expose its errors and correct them.

Chairman Mao instructed us that it is not a good style to be Marxist-Leninist towards others and liberal towards oneself, but some people overcorrect and are Marxist-Leninist towards themselves but liberal towards others, which is not an attitude of loving others with virtue. The correct attitude should be to be Marxist-Leninist towards others and Marxist-Leninist towards oneself.

If my words are right or wrong, please criticize and correct me, representatives.

### 对右派谈两个原则性问题  陈其瑗的发言

    对右派谈两个原则性问题
    陈其瑗的发言
    我完全拥护周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、彭副委员长、董院长、张检察长等的报告。
    “共产党员是由特殊材料制成的”这句话并没错
    请让我以一个长时期与共产党员合作和八年来受过党的教育改造的身份，来对右派分子和右倾思想人士谈谈两个有关原则性的问题。
    一、章乃器说，斯大林的“共产党员是由特殊材料制成的”这句话，是产生特权思想的根源。我反对这种说法。应该肯定，斯大林这句话并没有错。斯大林的用意不外“是勉励共产党员要有马克思列宁主义的思想，要有全心全意为人民服务的思想。”（陆定一代表在本次大会的发言）
    共产党员是由特殊材料制成的，在过去民主革命斗争的长时期是如此，在社会主义建设的今天也是如此，在将来建设共产主义的时候也是如此，因为建设社会主义共产主义的艰巨工作并不比民主革命斗争轻松。回想过去骑在我国人民头上的敌人如此强大而又如此残暴，如果没有前仆后继的成千成万的“特殊材料”，革命斗争就不可能取得胜利，特别是如果没有临危授命，至死不屈，为人类崇高理想而献身的“特殊材料”，红旗决不可能在白色恐怖中坚持。目前中国仍是处于国大而穷，文化落后的情况，没有全心全意为人民服务的“特殊材料”，以顽强的劳动去战胜困难，以无限忠诚和高度的热情去为人民的利益打算，也很难设想社会主义的幸福会自天而降。
    大革命时期，我为我所接触过或共同工作过的共产党员的言行所感动，如恽代英（黄埔军官学校总教官），邓中夏（省港大罢工委员会秘书长），萧楚女（广东农民运动讲习所教务长），许苏云（中央海外部秘书），杨匏安（广东省党部组织部长），刘尔嵩（广东省党部工人部长），方志敏（江西省党部农民部长），杨殷（广州公社肃反委员会主席）等，我认为他们都是特殊材料制成的人。抗美援朝时，我到过朝鲜，我更为中国人民志愿军中英勇牺牲的“特殊材料”所激动，如黄继光、伍先华等，他们创造了惊天动地的业绩。几年来，在防洪抢险斗争中，许多由特殊材料制成的人表现出了舍身救人、以身堵口的英勇牺牲行为。我还到过不少工厂、矿山、机关、学校、团体，到处有由特殊材料制成的人在起带头作用。我再肯定地说，共产党员是由特殊材料制成的人，是我国民族的精华，是真理的化身，是人类的希望。
    “特殊材料”并非天生而成的。共产党员也不是一朝一夕就成为特殊材料的，他必须经过党的教育，长期的学习，并且在工作和斗争中受过锻炼，百炼之后才可以成钢。党外人士如果经过锻炼，成为特殊材料之后，也可以成为共产党员。
    “特殊材料”不是今天才有，历史上许多爱国英雄和坚贞节烈之士，在不同的社会历史条件下，作出了可歌可泣的不可磨灭的贡献，提高了民族气节，同时推动了社会历史前进。如在封建时代的岳飞、文天祥、史可法；戊戌政变时代的谭嗣同、唐才常；在辛亥革命前后的林觉民、方声洞、秋瑾、徐锡麟以至黄花岗七十二烈士诸人，都是可生即生，可死即死，舍生取义，毫无犹豫的人。共产党员继承了我们民族的优良传统，并且加以发扬光大！
    当然，由于历史局限，过去任何时代的“特殊材料”与今天的“特殊材料”——工人阶级先锋队——还有历史任务上本质上的不同。今天的“特殊材料”的历史使命在于消灭人剥削人的制度，推动人类社会走向一个更高的阶段，建立社会主义以至共产主义社会。作前人所没有做过的事，与封建时代和资本主义社会所产生的特殊材料所担负的使命，是不可同日而语的。
    章乃器反对“共产党员是由特殊材料制成的”这句话，居心是恶毒的，他的用意实质上是反对马克思列宁主义思想，反对工人阶级先锋队全心全意为人民服务的思想，反对共产党的领导，实质上是反对人民。
    说“民生主义就是社会主义”只能在思想上制造混乱
    二、在帮助共产党整风当中还出现的许多有右倾思想人士的谬论，已经受到了应得的严正的驳斥，我不想多说了。曾为孙中山先生的一个追随者，我想对近来出现的“民生主义就是社会主义”的论调，提出个人不同的看法。
    三十五年前，我为孙中山先生晚年所订的“联俄、联共、扶助工农”的三大政策所鼓舞，毅然参加了第一次国共合作的中国国民党。我很清楚三大政策与“民生主义就是社会主义”是两回事。正如何香凝同志所说，在当时的国民党中，确有左、中、右三派人物，对于三大政策，那就是左派拥护，中派投机，右派反对。第一次国共合作，以蒋介石出卖革命而破裂，不少坚持三大政策的人被迫流亡或被屠杀了。这是个极为痛苦的教训。还应当指出，蒋介石和他的策士们就曾经利用“民生主义就是社会主义”的口号，在黄埔军校建立起“孙文主义学会”，树立起反共旗帜，使好好一个革命队伍由此而被分裂。他们以后还不断利用这一句口号去造成思想混乱和安抚人心。时至今日，社会主义已经成为活生生的现实，老百姓今天已经坚决跟共产党走上马列主义的社会主义之路。孙中山先生是革命的先行者，已有定论。孙中山先生所领导的辛亥革命的历史意义，任何人不能加以否认。中国人民继承了孙中山先生和诸先烈的革命优良传统和未竟之功，并把它推进到新的阶段了。如果今天还强调“民生主义就是社会主义”，除了在思想上制造混乱之外，对孙中山先生的光荣伟大不见得有所增益。国民党的进步人士能一贯地继承孙中山先生的三大政策，接受中国共产党的领导，今天为社会主义建设献出力量，无愧为孙中山先生的信徒。但孙中山先生的革命学说的精华部分，早已成为中国人民的共同财产，而为中国共产党和革命的民主党派所继承，少数人不必再以道统派自居罢！
    老一辈的民主人士，在向社会主义道路上前进的时候，有的对新事物还不习惯，有的则留恋过去。通过学习研究思考之后，有的是“利而行之”，也有的是“勉强而行之”。这是很自然的，而且是可以理解的。不过，思想的彻底改造是长期间的事情。有些人虽然已经进入社会主义革命阶段，仍保留一些资产阶级的思想意识，甚至还保留一些封建残余思想，这是在这次帮助共产党整风中不正确言论出现的一个重要因素，而且证明我们接受党中央、毛主席的号召进行思想改造，是非常必要的。我以为，在当前这场严重的思想斗争中，必须使我们的脑子发挥作用，分清敌我，明辨是非。我们必须坚决反对右派分子的反党、反社会主义、反无产阶级专政、反人民的言论行动，要与他们划清界限。同时也要与右倾思想人士作思想上的斗争。他们的似是而非的实质上是反对马列主义的修正主义和改良主义的言论，在社会主义建设的前进中是发生阻碍作用，而且淆乱人心的。上文所举即其一例，我们必须不断揭发其错误和纠正之。
    毛主席指示我们，对人马列主义，对己自由主义是不好的作风，但有些人矫枉过正，对己马列主义，对人自由主义也不是爱人以德的态度。正确的态度应该是，对人马列主义，对己也马列主义。
    我的话说得对与不对，请各位代表批评和指正。
