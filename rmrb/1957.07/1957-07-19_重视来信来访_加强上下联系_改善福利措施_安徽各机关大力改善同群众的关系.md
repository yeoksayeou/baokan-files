Anhui Organs Vigorously Improve Relations with the Masses

(Our reporter Yu Ming reports) Anhui Province's provincial-level organs are earnestly handling opinions raised by both Party members and non-Party members, vigorously improving shortcomings in their work, and improving connections with the people. In order to strengthen the work of handling people's letters and visits, the General Offices of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Anhui Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a meeting attended by leading Party and government officials at or above the county level throughout the province. The meeting emphasized that handling people's letters and visits is an important method for the Party and government to maintain close ties with the masses and required leaders of Party and government departments at all levels to personally lead this work. Currently, the Provincial People's Procuratorate has established a system whereby the Procurator-General receives visitors every Saturday afternoon. The Procurator-General received seventeen visitors on the first occasion, and earnestly handled their accusations, complaints, and opinions separately. The Provincial Court has also begun to implement a system of court presidents and judges receiving visitors on a regular basis, and responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have also begun to receive visitors who need to see them. Other provincial-level organs have strengthened their work in handling people's letters and visits. Non-Party members of the Provincial Department of Commerce criticized the department's leadership for lacking democratic style and holding too few administrative meetings, which resulted in some work not being fully understood and opinions not being widely solicited, affecting the quality of work. Now, the Provincial Department of Commerce has established a regulation to hold administrative meetings every Monday to promptly convey and arrange work, and to jointly study and solve problems. After implementing this system, the enthusiasm of non-Party cadres has been increased, and the work of the department's leadership has also become easier. The Grain Department and the Finance Department also did not hold department affairs meetings regularly in the past. Now, they hold regular department affairs meetings every month, and the director and responsible comrades of relevant units work collectively every Monday. The Provincial Post and Telecommunications Bureau and the Provincial People's Bank have strengthened their leadership over grassroots enterprises. The heads of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau are responsible for directly contacting and assisting the work of county post and telecommunications bureaus, and the first batch contacted thirty bureaus including Xuancheng, Lu'an, and Zongyang. The Provincial People's Bank sent four groups led by the vice president and directors to go deep into the grassroots to investigate the supply of funds and the withdrawal of currency in the peak season market. In the past, the section and group leaders of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs only signed and read documents and did not do specific work. Now, some drafts are personally drafted. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Procuratorate not only go to the grassroots to help study work and solve specific problems, but also pay attention to approaching the masses and strengthening political and ideological work for the masses. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee accepted the opinions of reporters and has notified local party committees to care about the work of reporters, provide them with the convenience of attending meetings, reading documents, and understanding the work of the party committee, and support their interview activities. Anhui Daily absorbed readers' opinions and advanced the newspaper's distribution time by one hour. In terms of welfare, responsible comrades such as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Governor have voluntarily cancelled their special cars and only use cars for official business. The Provincial Party Committee decided to cancel the movie pre-screening method. Mass-based welfare committees have been established in the General Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Public Security Department, the Provincial People's Court, the Provincial People's Bank, and other units to specifically study and solve welfare issues such as cadres' dormitories, relief, and meals. The Provincial Public Security Department distributed the new dormitory building built for the directors to comrades at the division level, and they lived together without distinction of rank. In the past, the cadres' dormitories of the Handicraft Industry Administration had many bedbugs and the air was not good. Now, the sanitation of the dormitory and its surroundings has been improved. In the past, road maintenance and surveying workers in the Department of Transportation had repeatedly proposed to take care of the welfare of staff working outside, but this had never been resolved. Now, road maintenance and surveying workers wear straw hats, goggles, and masks, and surveying workers working outside also have cots to use. At present, the Provincial Party Committee is further studying and improving methods of work with various units.

    安徽各机关大力改善同群众的关系
    本报讯  记者于明报道：安徽省省级机关正在认真地处理党内外所提的意见，大力改进工作中的缺点，改善和人民群众的联系。为了加强人民来信来访工作，中共安徽省委和安徽省人民委员会的办公厅，联合召开了全省县以上各级党政负责人参加的会议，在会上强调人民来信来访工作是党和政府密切联系群众的重要方法，要求各级党政部门的负责人亲自领导这项工作。目前省人民检察院建立了检察长每星期六下午定期接见人民来访制度，检察长第一次就接见了十七位来访者，对来访者的检举、控告和意见分别作了认真的处理。省法院也开始执行庭长、审判员定期接见群众来访制度，省委和省人民委员会的负责同志也开始接见需要他们接见的来访者。其他省级机关都加强了人民来信来访工作。省商业厅党外人士在检查中批评厅领导民主作风不够，行政例会开得少，致使有的工作未能充分了解情况，广泛征求意见，影响了工作质量。现在省商业厅已经建立了每星期一召开行政例会的规定，在会上及时传达和布置工作，有问题共同研究解决。在执行这项制度后提高了党外干部的积极性，厅领导工作也好做了。粮食厅、财政厅过去也是厅务会议不够正常，现在每月定期召开厅务会，每星期一厅长和有关单位负责同志集体办公。省邮电局、省人民银行都加强了对基层企业的领导，邮电局的负责人分工负责对县邮电局直接联系和帮助工作，第一批联系了宣城、六安、枞阳等三十个局。省人民银行由副行长和处长分别率领四个组深入到基层去调查研究旺季市场的资金供应和货币回笼情况。省民政厅的科组长干部过去只是签阅文件，不做具体工作，现在有些文稿都亲自草拟。省检察院的负责同志不但到基层去帮助研究工作，解决具体问题，也注意接近群众，加强了对群众的政治思想工作。省委宣传部接受了记者的意见，已通知各地党委关心记者工作，给与参加会议、阅读文件和了解党委工作情况的方便，支持他们的采访活动。安徽日报吸收了读者意见，将报纸发行时间提前了一个钟头。在生活福利方面，省委书记、省长等负责同志都主动地取消了专车，因公外出才使用小汽车。省委决定取消了电影预放办法。省委办公厅、公安厅、省人民法院、省人民银行等单位都成立了群众性的生活福利委员会，专门研究解决干部的宿舍、救济、伙食等福利问题。省公安厅将为处长新盖的宿舍大楼分给以处为单位的同志，不分等级统一分配居住。手工业管理局的干部宿舍过去臭虫多，空气不好，现已改善了宿舍及周围环境的卫生。交通厅的养路、测量工人过去多次提出照顾在外工作人员的福利，一直都未得到解决，现在养路和测量工人都戴上了草帽、风镜、口罩，在外测量的工人还有行军床使用。目前省委还在进一步和各单位研究改进工作的办法。
