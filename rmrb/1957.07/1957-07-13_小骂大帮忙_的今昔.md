    "Small Criticism, Big Help": Past and Present
    Zhuang Nong
    In the past, in China, there were indeed some journalists and newspapers that were very skilled at the trick of "small criticism, big help": under the smokescreen of "small criticism," they provided "big help" to the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, some people are suggesting that newspapers in socialist countries can also engage in "small criticism, big help." Linking "criticism" and "help" together to form a formula is a unity of contradictions, and there is much to be made of it.
    For example, if we assume that the position of today's proponents of "small criticism, big help" is the same as that of yesterday's proponents of "small criticism, big help," then applying this formula to two different objects can make the substance of this formula completely different. It can be divided into "criticizing" for the sake of "helping" or "helping" for the sake of "criticizing."
    The former "small criticism, big help" was a kind of "criticizing" for the sake of "helping." This criticism did not come from the heart but was forced by the fact that many people were "criticizing greatly." If one did not "criticize a little," one could not provide great help. "Small criticism" is a "fair posture" deliberately put on to be seen. After criticizing two sentences that didn't hit the mark, they would turn around and provide great help. At this time, the banner of "fairness" seemed to be in their hands, and they could turn around and point at those who criticized greatly, saying, "Look, he only says bad things and doesn't say good things; he can't bear to listen!"
    That was in the past. Today's "small criticism, big help" is about "helping" for the sake of "criticizing." How do I know this? Please listen to me explain.
    Building socialism is everyone's responsibility, and everyone who participates in building socialism is busy. As long as one wants to participate, one can start to be busy. Why would one need "help," let alone shout about "helping"? Can doing one's own thing be called "helping"? If there are shortcomings or mistakes in socialist construction, builders need to make practical and serious criticisms and take action to correct them. This is also everyone's duty, and no one will see this as scolding others. Then, is the position of those who advocate "criticism" and "help" standing within the socialist builders or outside of them?
    Socialism and the Communist Party, unlike capitalism or anything else, fundamentally don't need others to provide "small criticism, big help." What can only be maintained by "small criticism, big help" is definitely not socialism and the Communist Party. Socialism and the Communist Party are not afraid of "great criticism" and even less afraid of "small criticism." Haven't the rightists already been shouting abuses? What was the result? More people supported and defended them. Otherwise, how could so many people have come out to struggle against the rightists?
    Then why are some people still hoisting the banner of "small criticism, big help"? The answer is that it is for the sake of "criticizing." These people understand very well that if, in the past, some people had to pretend to "criticize" in order to "help," today, in order to "criticize," they have to pretend to "help" even more. Because the power of the people today is incomparably stronger than before. In the past, "not criticizing" only meant not being trusted; now, not pretending to "help" is more than just not being trusted!
    Since it is "helping" for the sake of "criticizing," one will never be able to provide any decent help. This "criticism" will never just be "small criticism"; hasn't it already been proposed that "counter-melodies" should be sung in addition to small criticism? And haven't some newspapers already come out to criticize greatly? And "great criticism" is never just "criticizing." "Criticism" is the prelude to "elimination." The Chinese people are not lacking in this kind of experience. We have greatly criticized imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and we have also greatly criticized capitalism. What has happened to those things now? Haven't they been eliminated by us? And doesn't the exposed activity of the Zhang-Luo Alliance also explain what their great criticism is for?

    “小骂大帮忙”的今昔
    庄农
    以前的中国，确有一些报人和报纸，很会“小骂大帮忙”这一套：在“小骂”的烟幕下帮了国民党反动派的“大忙”。现在又有人提出社会主义国家的报纸，也可以“小骂大帮忙”。把“骂”和“帮忙”连结起来，而形成为一个公式，这是矛盾的统一，其中是大有文章可作的。
    比如说吧，假定今天的“小骂大帮忙”论者的立场就是昔日的“小骂大帮忙”者的立场，那么，把这个公式运用于两种不同对象的时候，就可以使这个公式的实质完全不同。它可以分成为“帮忙”而“骂”或为“骂”而“帮忙”。
    以前的“小骂大帮忙”，是一种为“帮忙”而“骂”。这种骂并非出自本心，而是迫于有许多人在“大骂”，倘不“小骂”，就帮不了大忙。“小骂”者，故意装出来给人看的一种“公正姿态”也。不关痛痒的骂了两句，然后转而去大帮忙，这时“公道”的大旗好像就握在他们手里，而且反过来可以指着大骂的人的鼻子说：“看，他只说坏话，不说好话，听不得的呀！”
    这是昔日的事。现在的“小骂大帮忙”，却是要为“骂”而“帮忙”了。何以见得？请听我道来。
    建设社会主义是人人有责的，而参加建设社会主义的人又是个个都忙的。只要他想参加，便可以下手来忙，何需“帮忙”，更何需大嚷“帮忙”，难道自己办自己的事还能叫“帮忙”吗？社会主义建设中发生了缺点或错误，需要建设者切实而严肃的批评，并动手来纠正它。这也是人人份内的事，不会有人把这看作是骂别人。那末，持着“骂”和“帮忙”的人的立场，是站在社会主义建设者之中了呢，还是之外了呢？
    社会主义和共产党，不像资本主义或其他什么玩艺一样，根本就用不着别人来“小骂大帮忙”。靠了“小骂大帮忙”才能维持的就决不是社会主义和共产党。社会主义和共产党不怕“大骂”，更不怕“小骂”。右派分子不是已经在破口大骂了吗？结果怎样呢？支持和拥护的人更多了。不然怎么会有这么多的人出来同右派分子斗争呢？
    那末为什么还有人要掮出“小骂大帮忙”的牌子来呢？答曰是为了要“骂”。这些人很懂得：如果过去有人为了“帮忙”，不得不装着要“骂”，今天为了要“骂”，就更不得不装着要“帮忙”。因为今天人民的力量是比以前强大得不可比了。以前“不骂”，仅仅是不能取信而已，现在不装着“帮忙”，岂止是不能取信哉！
    既然是为了“骂”而“帮忙”，就决帮不出什么像样的忙来，这“骂”也决不会只是“小骂”；不是已经同时提出在小骂之外还要唱“对台戏”的吗？而且不是已有报纸出来大骂过了吗？而“大骂”也决不只是“骂骂”而已。“骂”者“消灭”之前奏也。中国人民是不缺乏这种经验的。我们曾大骂过帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，也大骂过资本主义，现在那些东西怎么样了呢？不是已被我们消灭掉了吗？而从已揭露出的章罗联盟的活动，不也说明他们的大骂是为着什么吗？
