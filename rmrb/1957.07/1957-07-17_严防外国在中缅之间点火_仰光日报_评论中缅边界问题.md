Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, July 16th: The influential "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial on the 14th, stating that judging from Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Sino-Burmese border issue: "It can be considered that the resolution of the issue will continue to be smooth in the future."

The editorial said: "Border issues are naturally very complex. Under these circumstances, those foreign groups who want to complicate the political situation in Burma, as well as certain Burmese people who have already fallen into foreign diplomatic traps, hope to ignite fires between the Burmese and Chinese people over issues created by colonialists many years ago." It also said: "The Americans pretend to be sad for us, and they are interfering. This reminds us of their interference in Taiwan in order to keep Chiang Kai-shek on their side."

The editorial emphasized: "Due to these circumstances, we believe that mutual and face-to-face discussions and the principle of resolving issues by China and Burma are the correct approach."

    严防外国在中缅之间点火
    “仰光日报”评论中缅边界问题
    新华社仰光16日电　有影响的“仰光日报”14日发表社论说，从周恩来总理关于中缅边境问题的报告看来：“可以认为今后问题的解决仍然会是顺利的。”
    社论说：“边境问题自然是很复杂的，在这种情况下，那些想使缅甸政治局势中的问题复杂化的外国集团的人们，以及某些已经陷入外国的外交圈套的缅甸人，希望在殖民主义者在很多年以前造成的问题上在缅甸人和中国人之间点火。”它又说：“美国人假装为了我们而难过，他们在进行干涉。这使我们想起了他们为了要把蒋介石保留在他们那一边而对台湾进行的干涉。”
    社论强调说：“由于这些情况，我们认为相互和面对面的讨论和由中国与缅甸来解决的原则是正确的方针。”
