To the Distribution Office of the People's Daily:

The Tianjin Postal Bureau's various delivery branches used to deliver the People's Daily and other Beijing editions of newspapers and periodicals during the third delivery shift of the day. Under normal circumstances, the delivery staff would leave their branches around 11:00 AM and complete all deliveries by around 12:30 PM (except for some suburban and remote areas). However, recently the People's Daily has been consistently arriving late, causing all delivery branches in the city to leave their stations between 12:40 PM and 1:15 PM, a delay of more than an hour compared to the scheduled departure time, and in some cases, nearly two hours. This also delays the distribution time of other newspapers and magazines, leading to complaints from readers and difficulties with internal operations within the bureau:

	(1) Recently, the weather has been getting hotter, and the receiving and dispatch staff of various government offices and enterprises are taking their lunch breaks, while schools and individual households are taking afternoon naps. The late arrival of the People's Daily, with deliveries taking place during lunchtime, coupled with the need for signatures for magazines, has caused some receiving and dispatch staff and residents to complain that it is disrupting their rest.

	(2) The staff of the bureau's newspaper and periodical distribution room start work at 4:00 AM every day, and the branch delivery staff and newspaper and periodical distributors arrive at their posts at 5:00 AM. If the People's Daily cannot be delivered by noon, it will make their working hours too long, preventing them from getting rest.

	(3) The late arrival of the People's Daily in Tianjin also affects its timeliness. If it arrives on schedule, many government offices and enterprises can read the newspaper during work hours in the morning; if it arrives late, they will inevitably only be able to see it in the afternoon.

We hope that the People's Daily can be delivered to Tianjin on time, which would be beneficial to both the bureau's work and the readers in Tianjin.

 Hope to See the Newspaper Sooner
Dear Editors:

I am a reader of your newspaper. As a reader, my hope for the newspaper is that, in addition to increasing my knowledge, I can also see the newspaper as soon as possible. In the past, your newspaper could be delivered to us by the afternoon of the next day, but this has not been the case in recent months. Often, it takes two or three days to see the newspaper (for example, the June 20th newspaper only arrived on the evening of the 22nd). The news becomes old news, and we have a sense of "yesterday's news." I hope you will pay attention to this work and find ways to advance the publication time.
Wuhan City, Chen Yuanfang

The Most Frustrating Thing
Dear Editors:

I am a reader who loves to read the People's Daily. The People's Daily has established a deep friendship with me. It is an indispensable political nourishment and a constant companion in our daily lives. However, recently, we often cannot see the newspaper on the day it is published, and even the newspaper from the following day is often not available. This is the most frustrating and unsatisfactory thing. For example, on June 23rd, we only received the newspapers from the 20th and 21st, a gap of four days, and often two days arrive at once. The news becomes history, and readers cannot read it in detail in a timely manner. This situation is detrimental to both the mission of the newspaper and the readers' requirements in political, cultural, and other aspects of life. I sincerely suggest that you advance the publication time and improve the distribution work to meet the needs of the readers.
Shaanxi Xianyang, Yin Xiaofang

It is a Pity the Paper Comes Out Too Late
Dear Editors:

The People's Daily, the most popular newspaper among the people, is an indispensable political nourishment for me every day. Every time the newspaper arrives, every comrade rushes to read it, especially since the rectification campaign began, the newspaper has published many important speeches and articles, which have been of great help to us, enabling us to stand firm and resolutely draw a clear line with the right-wing elements. Unfortunately, recently, I often cannot see the People's Daily on the day it is published, which makes me very anxious. I hope you can improve the newspaper's publication and distribution work.
Baoding, Zheng Kefeng

### 报纸迟到给我们增加许多困难

    报纸迟到给我们增加许多困难人民日报发行处：
    天津市邮局各投递支局，过去是在每日第三次投递班投送人民日报和北京版的其它报刊，在正常情况下，各投递员于十一点左右先后出局，十二点三十分前后（个别郊、远地区除外）即可全部投送完毕。但是人民日报最近经常晚到，全市各投递局于十二点四十分至十三点十五分才能出局，较正点出局迟一个多小时，有的接近两小时。这就使其他报纸及杂志的发行时间也被延误，读者有意见，本局内部作业也有困难：
      （一）近来天气渐热，各机关和企业的收发员，中午正是休息吃饭时间，学校及个别住户是午睡时间。人民日报迟到，投送时正值中午，加以杂志需要签收等手续，使得有些收发员及住户因影响其休息而有意见。
      （二）本局报刊分发室作业人员，每天早晨四点多钟上班，支局投递员及报刊分发员都在五点多钟到班，如果人民日报到中午还不能送完，就使他们的工作时间拉得太长得不到休息。
    （三）人民日报晚点到津，在时效上也受影响。如正点到津，很多机关企业上午能在班上看到报；如晚点到，就势必在下午方能见到。
    我们希望人民日报能按时送到天津，这对本局工作和对天津读者都是有利的。　天津市邮局
  希望尽早看到报纸编辑同志：
    我是贵报的一个读者。作为一个读者对报纸的希望，除能增长本人的知识外，还希望能尽早的看到报纸。过去，你们的报纸在次日的下午就可以送到我们手中，但最近几个月来，就不是这样了，往往要隔两三天才能见到报纸（如6月20日的报纸，要在22日的晚上才能看到）。新闻变成了旧闻，我们看后大有“明日黄花”之感。希望你们重视一下这个工作，设法提早出版时间。　武汉市　陈元芳
  最令人头痛的事编辑同志：
    我是一个爱看人民日报的读者。人民日报已和我建立了深厚情谊，它是我们日常生活中不可缺少的政治食粮和时刻不能离开的伙伴。但是最近以来，我们经常不能看到当天的报纸，就是隔日报纸也常不能看到。这是最令人头痛和不满的。比如，6月23日，我们才收到20和21日的报，中间相隔四天，一次又来两天的。新闻既变成了历史，读者又无时详读。这种情况，对报纸的任务和读者在政治、文化生活等方面的要求来说，都是不利的。我诚恳地建议你们提早出版时间，改进发行工作，以满足读者的要求。
              陕西咸阳　尹效芳遗憾的是出报太晚了编辑同志：
    人民最欢迎的报纸——人民日报，对我来说是每天不可缺少的政治食粮。每次报纸到后，每个同志都争先恐后地阅读，特别是整风以来报上刊登了不少重要发言与文章，对我们帮助很大，使我们能站稳立场，坚决同右派分子划清界限。遗憾的是，最近以来，经常不能看到当天的人民日报，使我非常着急。希望你们能改进一下报纸出版发行工作。　保定　郑克丰
