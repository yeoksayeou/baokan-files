Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: China’s first wide-screen stereophonic cinema opened in Beijing today. At the opening ceremony, a reception was held for the Beijing premiere of the Soviet wide-screen film "Prelude to a Revolution," which was accompanied by the screening of China's first color wide-screen stereophonic documentary, "May Day Celebration" (a record of the grand celebrations of this year’s "May 1st" festival by the people of the capital). When the screen showed the scene of Tiananmen Square on the night of the "May 1st" carnival—beautiful fireworks crackling in the night sky and the joyous singing and dancing of the crowd—the audience felt as if they were actually at Tiananmen Square.

Those attending the opening ceremony and reception included Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice Ministers Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, and Zheng Zhenduo, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Yang Hansheng, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China Abrasimov, Chief Representative of the Soviet Film Export Company in China Zakharevich, and figures from the capital's film and cultural and artistic circles. Famous film actress Bai Yang introduced the Soviet film workers' representatives who were invited to attend the opening ceremony and reception to the 1,200 audience members present – the director of the film "Prelude to a Revolution," 吉干 (Ji Gan), actress 康德拉契耶娃 (Kangdelaqiyeva), and screenwriter 什坦因 (Shitan Yin). Wang Lanxi, Assistant Minister of Culture and Director of the Film Bureau, said in his speech: The opening of the first wide-screen stereophonic cinema and the screening of the first wide-screen stereophonic film are new achievements in China's film art and technology; the Russian Revolution of 1905 was the prelude to the October Revolution, and the film "Prelude to a Revolution," which depicts this revolutionary struggle, is of even greater significance as it is released on the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. 吉干 (Ji Gan), 康德拉契耶娃 (Kangdelaqiyeva), and 什坦因 (Shitan Yin) also spoke.

When the electrically operated curtain slowly opened to the edge of the stage, the entire screen was revealed to the audience. The projection surface of this curved screen is 15.23 meters wide and 6.1 meters high (the projection surface of a normal screen is 4.5 meters wide and 3.5 meters high). The screen is made of aluminum, and the projected images have a three-dimensional effect and are brighter than ordinary screens without being harsh on the eyes. Three sets of loudspeakers are installed behind the screen on the left, center, and right, and there are also many auxiliary small loudspeakers inside the walls and ceiling around the auditorium (ordinary cinemas only have one set of loudspeakers behind the screen), forming a stereophonic transmission network, so that the various sounds in the film come from different locations with the movements of the characters on stage, with distinctions of up and down, left and right, near and far. The audience feels as if they are on the scene, and the images on the screen seem real.

This cinema was rebuilt from the original Capital Cinema. The designer of the reconstruction project was architect Liu Shiming, one of the designers of the cinema's original construction 21 years ago.

    我国第一座宽银幕电影院开幕
    我国第一部彩色宽银幕立体声纪录片同时上映
    新华社1日讯　我国第一座宽银幕立体声电影院今天在北京开幕。在开幕式上，举行了苏联宽银幕影片“革命的前奏”在北京首次映出招待会，并加映了我国第一部彩色宽银幕立体声纪录片“五月的节日”（首都群众庆祝今年“五一”节盛况）。当银幕上出现天安门广场“五一”狂欢之夜的画面——夜空中噼咧作响的美丽的焰火，满场人群的欢乐歌舞时，观众好像也被带到了天安门广场。
    参加开幕式和招待会的，有国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅，文化部部长沈雁冰、副部长钱俊瑞、夏衍、郑振铎，中国对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙，苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办阿布拉西莫夫，苏联影片输出公司驻华总代表查哈列维奇，以及首都电影界、文化艺术界人士。著名电影演员白杨向在场的一千二百个观众介绍了应邀来参加开幕式和招待会的苏联电影工作者代表——影片“革命的前奏”的导演吉干、演员康德拉契耶娃、编剧什坦因。文化部部长助理、电影事业管理局局长王阑西在讲话中说：第一座宽银幕立体声电影院的开幕和第一部宽银幕立体声影片的映出，是我国电影艺术和技术的新成就；俄国1905年的革命斗争是十月革命的序幕，描写这一革命斗争的影片“革命的前奏”，在中国共产党三十六周年纪念日上映更有巨大的意义。吉干、康德拉契耶娃和什坦因也先后讲了话。
    当电动操纵的帷幕慢慢揭开到台口的边缘时，银幕才全部呈现在观众的眼前。这个弧形的银幕的放映面宽十五点二三公尺、高六点一公尺（一般银幕放映面宽四公尺半、高三公尺半）。银幕是用铝制成的，放映出来的画面有立体感，并比普通银幕明亮而不刺激眼睛。银幕后面左中右装了三组扬声器，观众厅四周墙壁内和顶棚中还有许多辅助性的小型扬声器（普通影院只幕后有一组扬声器），构成了立体声的传送网，使得影片中各种声音随着登场人物的动作，从各个不同地点发出来，有上下左右远近之分，观众听来如身临其境，银幕上的影像好像真的一般。
    这座电影院是由原来的首都电影院改建的。改建工程的设计者是二十一年前这座影院兴建工程设计人之一刘世铭建筑师。
