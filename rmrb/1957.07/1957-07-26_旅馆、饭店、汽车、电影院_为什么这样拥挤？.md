Xinhua News Agency, July 25th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reports: Regarding the question of why urban public welfare buildings and public utilities cannot meet the needs of the people, a recent survey by relevant central departments on the population growth of fifteen cities has put forward a new and potentially very important answer: there are too many dependents in the cities, and their growth is too fast. These dependents average about 60% of the total population of the surveyed cities.

For a long time in many cities, people have felt that public utilities, etc., cannot meet the needs, and many public places are crowded and inconvenient. Crowding is a common phenomenon in many cities' public transportation, hotels, restaurants, department stores, hospitals, and cultural and entertainment venues.

In the past, the general view of the origin of this situation was only due to the improvement of people's living standards and the fact that public utilities, etc., could not keep up with the development of industrial construction. One conclusion drawn from this view is that more investment should be made in public buildings and public utilities.

The situation of too many and too rapidly growing dependents in the fifteen cities that have been surveyed means that the problem of excessive investment in public utilities while still failing to meet the needs of the people can be prevented not mainly by increasing the proportion of urban public buildings and public utility investment in the entire construction, but by appropriately controlling the growth of the dependent population.

The population of these fifteen cities was investigated by the State Planning Commission and other agencies. These cities include Shanghai, Wuhan, Zhuzhou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Baotou, Datong, Taiyuan, Harbin, Changchun, Anshan, and Shenyang. The basic population of these cities in 1956 (referring to the basic members of the city's political, economic, cultural, and other aspects of life) increased by more than 1,010,000 people compared to 1953, an increase of 28%; service personnel increased by 5%; while the dependent population increased by 2,480,000, an increase of 70% (of which 15% participate in household labor). The person providing information to the reporter said that due to calculation method issues, the actual number of dependents increased significantly more than 2,480,000. Of the increased dependent population, in addition to the children born to women who originally lived in these cities, 1,210,000 were family members who migrated from other places, especially rural areas, and the children born to these family members.

The person providing information to the reporter said that this survey is not very precise, but the problem it reflects seems to be certain and has national significance. In recent years, the population of large and medium-sized cities in my country has grown very rapidly. The number of cities with a population of more than one million has increased to thirteen, compared to only five in the early days of liberation. The number of cities with a population of 500,000 to 1 million has increased to more than thirty. The main factor contributing to the rapid population growth in cities is the too rapid growth of the dependent population in cities.

### 旅馆、饭店、汽车、电影院……为什么这样拥挤？

    旅馆、饭店、汽车、电影院……
    为什么这样拥挤？
    新华社25日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：城市公共福利建筑和公用事业为什么不能满足人民需要的问题，中央有关部门最近对十五个城市人口增长情况的调查，提出了一个新的可能是很重要的答案：城市里被抚养人口太多，增长太快了；这些人口平均已经达到所调查的城市全部人口的60％左右。
    在许多城市里，好久以来人们就感到公用事业等不能满足需要，很多公共场所拥挤不便。拥挤，已是许多城市的公共交通和旅馆、饭店、百货公司、医院和文化娱乐等场所的普遍现象。
    这种状况的来由，过去一般看法只是由于人民生活水平的提高和公用事业等赶不上工业建设等方面的发展。这种看法引出的一个结论就是应该更多地增加公共建筑和公用事业的投资。
    已经调查的十五个城市被抚养人口太多增长太快的情况，意味着主要不是用更多的钱提高城市公共建筑和公用事业在整个建设中的投资比重，而可以用适当控制被抚养人口增长的办法，来防止公用事业投资过大而又不能满足人民生活需要的问题。
    这十五个城市的人口是国家计划委员会等机关调查的。这些城市包括上海、武汉、株洲、洛阳、郑州、重庆、成都、兰州、包头、大同、太原、哈尔滨、长春、鞍山和沈阳。这些城市1956年的基本人口（指城市政治、经济、文化等生活方面的基本成员）比1953年增加了一百零一万多人，增长28％；服务人员增长5％；而被抚养人口却增加了二百四十八万，增长70％（其中15％参加家务劳动）。向记者提供情况的人说，由于计算方法上的问题，被抚养人口增加的实际数字要大大超过二百四十八万。在增加的被抚养人口中，除原住在这些城市的妇女生的孩子以外，有一百二十一万人是属于外地特别是农村迁来的家属和这些家属生的孩子。
    向记者提供情况的人说，这个调查不是很精确的，但它反映的问题看来是肯定的，是有全国意义的。近年来，我国大中城市人口都增长很快，全国一百万人以上的城市已发展到十三个，解放初期只有五个；五十万到一百万人口的城市已增加到了三十多个。城市人口所以增长这样快，城市里被抚养人口增长太快是主要因素之一。
