I, though not born into a landlord or bourgeois family, am an old intellectual from the old society. I was deeply stained by the bad habits of the old society, and my petty-bourgeois liberal ideas were deeply rooted. Although I have studied and written about Marxism-Leninism, it was only considered theoretically or conceptually accepted dogma. I did not closely integrate with the actual struggle of workers and peasants, did not serve the workers and peasants, and could not change the essence of my original thought. Although I participated in some democratic revolutionary movements, I only strengthened my petty-bourgeois liberal consciousness, which hindered my ideological progress toward socialism. Therefore, everything I did in the past in studying Marxism-Leninism and participating in the democratic revolution, when measured by today's socialist requirements, has become a stumbling block to my own progress. I must face the truth and thoroughly shatter everything of my old self in order to be a new person in the new society. I must also do this to be worthy of the Party, the people, and myself!

I.

Now I have a clearer understanding that whether we old intellectuals support the socialist road is not just a matter of empty words or subjective wishes and feelings, but requires a clear understanding of some fundamental issues, a firm stand, and the ability to withstand tests. And these fundamental issues take whether or not one supports the Chinese Communist Party and believes in the Chinese Communist Party as their premise. The Party is the vanguard of the working class revolution and the "core force" representing the working class in leading the Chinese people to complete the democratic revolution and carry out the social revolution. This is an ironclad fact. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be none of this, especially the realization of socialist construction.

In the past, I seemed to be able to talk about the superficial principles of this issue, and I had a history of following the Party for twenty or thirty years. Can I say it's not true? However, through the test of facts and deep examination, I realized that it was not entirely the case. For example, I was originally a Party member, but I dropped out and was expelled from the Party because I could not overcome difficulties and complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Later, I had the opportunity to explain the situation at the time and strive to resume organizational life, but because I was afraid of sacrifice and losing my personal free life, I deliberately avoided this issue with Party comrades. After liberation, although I confessed all the facts to the Party, I still could not face my shortcomings. I still thought that I was not guilty of any crime against the Party, and I did not meet with the Party ideologically. Instead, I wanted to avoid these shortcomings, fearing that the Party would scratch this ideological scar – insisting: I only help the Party unconditionally, as much as I can. Just look at this serious ideological problem, can I still say that I dedicate everything to the Party, to the revolution, to the people? Isn't this deceiving myself?

Because my attitude towards the Party was incorrect, I also had wrong views on the Party's leadership. It is true that since Chairman Mao led the Chinese Communist Party, I have basically supported the Party's policies. At the same time, I often strived to win over Party comrades to work together and reported my work to Party comrades (sometimes I did this to escape work responsibilities). However, I often only emphasized accepting the leadership of the Party's policies and guidelines, and neglected the Party's organizational leadership. I personally did not feel that I had a direct responsibility to the Party and had to frequently ask the Party for instructions; I had even less direct contact with the Party organization. As a result, I placed too much emphasis on the Party's leadership in terms of policies and guidelines, and neglected the "core force" (Party organization) that leads, guarantees, and supervises the implementation of these policies and guidelines. This not only cannot effectively implement the Party's leadership, but also easily leads to the danger of acting alone and breaking away from the Party's leadership. Therefore, I did not clearly understand the meaning of regarding work as work assigned to me by the Party, and sometimes even had the idea of confronting the Party; this is of course a big mistake when measured by today's socialist requirements.

Furthermore, when it comes to my view of Party members, I did not measure them based on their noble qualities of truly possessing proletarian, infinite loyalty to the revolution and the Party, but rather based on whether they had special external talents or so-called abilities. I even thought that those old Party members who had been tempered for a long time, were simple and unadorned, and never bowed to any difficulties, were virtuous but not very capable, and they could only charge into battle against the enemy, but could not be competent for more complex construction work. Therefore, the Party members I could talk to were mostly limited to some intellectuals, and I rarely got close to worker-peasant Party members. As a result, I had no feelings for worker-peasant Party members at all, let alone love.

From this, it can be seen that my process of approaching and leaning towards the Party actually harbored many incorrect ideas and dissatisfied emotions towards the Party. If these ideas are not overcome, it is impossible to further follow the Party and further accept the Party's leadership. Therefore, I often had the idea that the Party is the Party, and I am me, and we cannot be connected by blood and flesh and become one.

II.

The same problem also exists in my understanding of the people's democratic dictatorship. If I only talk about theory, I can talk a lot, but when it comes to practical problems, it is not that simple. For example, to clarify the nature and tasks of the people's democratic dictatorship, we must first clarify the practical significance or revolutionary significance of the dictatorship over the enemies of the people. But on this issue, I often did not draw a clear enough line between ourselves and the enemy, forgetting the enemy's cruelty to the people and the purpose of the people's revolution. Instead, I was afraid that the people would go too far against the enemy. For example, I had such emotions when dealing with land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, etc. Especially in the anti-rightist movement of intellectuals, although I supported "all counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed," I haggled over "all mistakes must be corrected," thinking that this aspect was not done enough and had many opinions. I did not know that the great significance of these movements is the essential manifestation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the purpose of the people's revolution. It must not be mentioned in the same breath as certain so-called deviations brought about by the movement. For example, after the great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction, the antagonistic contradictions within the people have been basically eliminated. However, the elements within the people who were originally exploiting classes (such as landlords and reactionary bourgeoisie), as well as counter-revolutionaries, and even thieves and robbers, still exist and must be subject to the function of the dictatorship. Even in order to exert the leadership of the working class—the leadership of the Party—it should be manifested in the role of centralization and dictatorship. And democracy must be expanded only under this premise. However, my ideological understanding often focused on expanding the democratic life, so that I unconsciously merged with the bourgeoisie's hypocritical democratic ideas without realizing it. This is not accidental either.

From the above, in order to enter socialism, my ideological understanding has made principled errors on the position that must be firmly established. And this error is manifested in the ideological remolding of intellectuals. Although I agree with the Party's policy on intellectuals in principle and do not doubt it, I have not done enough to practice this policy. I have not taken the lead in studying well, let alone determined to go to factories and rural areas to experience the lives of workers and farmers and learn from them. That is to say, I have not yet thoroughly transformed my own determination and understanding. In addition, since liberation, I have rarely participated in major political reform movements and lack opportunities for ideological training. The life of democratic parties lacks ideological education of criticism and self-criticism, which has become a breeding ground for cultivating liberal ideas among intellectuals. Therefore, my liberal ideas, which are absolutely incompatible with socialism, are easily preserved.

Due to the existence of my erroneous ideas, I could not withstand the test when the earth-shaking socialist revolution arrived.

The most obvious example is that since the Zhang-Luo alliance manipulated the central committee of the China Democratic League and used the League's national working conference in March of this year to openly carry out their conspiracy arrangements (according to Fei Xiaotong's speech at the conference, he admitted that ideological toxins were planted at the League's second congress. I haven’t checked that yet, I’m really confused). In the second half of the meeting, they also invited guests in different ways and vigorously wooed the local backbone of the League. During Zhang's dinner invitation to us (I was invited by Wu Chunxuan, who said it was a working group meeting on intellectual issues, and those present were Chu Tunan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Shen Zhiyuan, Qian Duansheng, Feng Sutao, and me), he talked about some of these words, his general idea was: "I understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech, China is a big country with 600 million people, and they have to manage their eating, clothing, housing, walking, and even fertility issues. This is an unprecedented burden, and I am afraid that even Chairman Mao did not expect it at first." He also said: "China has the most democrats and the fewest socialists, but it has to take the road of socialism. This is the biggest contradiction among the internal contradictions of the Chinese people. If Chinese socialists do not give full democracy, how can democrats give play to their enthusiasm to obey socialism?" Speaking of this, he talked a lot about his principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" must be implemented; and said: "The supervisory power he proposed to give to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is one of the ways to implement this principle." Zhang also said: "I inquired about the tone from Xi Zhongxun, saying that 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision' is not easy to do, so I strongly advocated taking 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend' as the central task at this meeting. With this, it creates conditions for 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision', otherwise it is just empty talk and cannot be realized." Zhang also said: "Mao talked to old friends in Shanghai, he would rather not be the chairman to engage in 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend'." Later, Zhang said again: "There are hundreds of millions of democrats, and we intellectuals have millions." and so on (his words were not spoken continuously, now they are organized based on what I can remember; and because I arrived late and left early, I may not have heard some words). Later, Zhang Bojun distorted and conveyed Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council on April 30, and especially made a "out of context" transmission of Chairman Mao's speech on the issue of socialism and democracy, in order to strengthen the power of his fallacy.

Because my ideological situation at that time was that I wrongly believed that the domestic class relations had been basically eliminated, and the Party's leadership and the people's democratic dictatorship could be relatively reduced in internal relations, and the internal democratic life could be relatively expanded. I did not deeply understand that the development of socialist democracy is inseparable from strengthening the leadership of the Party and the working class. Therefore, there was no essential difference between my thinking and Zhang's thinking; so I listened to his words and was poisoned by him without realizing it.

In fact, if we carefully analyze it with the eyes of Marxism-Leninism, we can know that the contradiction between socialism and democracy that Zhang said is of course the contradiction between the working class and the non-working class. Zhang said that there are few socialists and many democrats, of course, that there are few members of the working class and many members of the non-working class. He said that if socialists do not give democrats full democracy, they cannot make democrats obey socialism. Of course, the working class must recognize the full democracy of the non-working class, otherwise the non-working class will not be able to serve socialism. At the same time, he combined this issue with "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," which more clearly indicates that the only one who represents socialism is the Communist Party, while other democratic parties represent the non-working class; and the former has fewer people and the latter has more people. They can use this contradiction to gather together and compete with the Communist Party for the world. In this way, they hate the Party's leadership, and say "the Party's world," hate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class as "the root of the three evils," and so on. It is not surprising. And it can be thought that Zhang's absurd theory can really connect all the rightist thoughts that oppose the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and agriculture and handicrafts, and create the situation he妄想that united to attack the Party, and finally achieve his goal of eliminating the Party's leadership, eliminating socialism, and implementing reactionary rule and restoration. Based on Zhang's fallacy, he proposed the "Political Design Institute" to "compete with the Party" and "share the same scenery," I am afraid he still felt very polite. Zhang's so-called "loving socialism and loving democratic freedom" probably comes from this reactionary thought; doesn't Zhang even know that without the Party's leadership, taking the socialist road, the country will perish, what is there to talk about democratic freedom!

Luo's political program, which he advocated at that time, highlighted the need to "treat intellectuals with courtesy and visit them three times" and was based on fallacies such as Fei Xiaotong's "early spring weather"; it is necessary to give intellectuals a special status and warmth, without emphasizing transformation. Compared with Zhang's political program, Luo's political program seems to be mutually incompatible and has a distinction between lesser and greater witches; but because it later developed into Luo's proposal of "Rehabilitation Committee," Ye Duyi's organization of a large political party of intellectuals and "Party withdraws from schools" and "abandoning the leadership of science," it has become an important part of the Zhang-Luo alliance, using the China Democratic League to carry out an anti-Party and anti-socialist program.

At that time, because what Zhang said resonated with my original meaning (in fact, I did not know its true meaning at that time), and Luo's views on intellectuals were the common views of some people in the China Democratic League working conference (the starting points may be different), I brought this toxin back to Wuhan and conveyed some to the members of the China Democratic League in Hubei Province without correct analysis and criticism; and guided my words and deeds with my own original erroneous thoughts, combined with Zhang and Luo's thoughts.

In the great "blooming" and great "contending," Zhang and Luo sent people to major cities to ignite the fire on the one hand; on the other hand, they made fallacies in Beijing, put forward the requirements of "Political Design Institute" and "Rehabilitation Committee," and shouted out the slogans "opposing the Party's world," "the Party withdraws from schools," and "the proletarian dictatorship is the root of the three evils," which affected members of the League and people outside the League in various places, who could not distinguish right from wrong, contended in a mess, and confused people's minds. Although the "blooming" and "contending" in Wuhan's colleges and universities were relatively late, and had not yet entered the stage of these major issues; however, ideologically, there were these fallacies as a foundation, even in dealing with general issues (such as the issue of anti-counter-revolutionaries), it could be bustling.

The most vicious thing is that Zhang Bojun deliberately distorted Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council on April 30, saying that Chairman Mao suggested that the school Party committee system should be abolished first, which further promoted the evil wind of the first stage of "blooming" and "contending" in Wuhan City to reach a climax, forming a rampant situation of attacking the Party, and painted the activities of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League in the "blooming" and "contending" with the color of being in line with the activities of Zhang and Luo. I am the chairman, of course, I have to be responsible.

At the same time, it also made me utter anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, giving great losses to the Party and the people. For example: I advocated allowing intellectuals who have suffered in the anti-counter-revolutionaries to complain and pour out their bitterness; I think our school has so-called homicidal logic in the anti-counter-revolutionaries; For example: I think that old cadres are prone to empiricism, and new Party members are prone to dogmatism; I think that some Party members have privileged ideas, not serving the people, but the people serving them; I said: "Some people say that there are wooden people in the Party"; For example: I said: "It is good for some of the Party's dogmatism to clash with the opportunism outside the Party"; I said: "The People's Daily editorial on June 8 is somewhat dogmatic, and it wants to kill it with one stick"; I said: "Some people say that the personnel department of the school Party is the Yama Hall" and so on.

This is enough to prove that my thinking at that time had in fact become a prisoner of Zhang and Luo's thinking; my remarks had in fact become Zhang and Luo's echoing bugs. Only because I participated in this conference, studied Chairman Mao's speech, and Premier Zhou's report, and received the warm help of the representatives of the Hubei delegation, especially the help of Party member comrades, and listened to the thrilling speeches of the representatives in the conference to counterattack the rightists, and after my own ideological examination, I understood that the Zhang-Luo alliance was precisely to complete the common task of anti-Party and anti-socialism, and to pave the way for the restoration of reactionary rule; the result would only make the Chinese people never recover. And also because I have liberal ideas that are absolutely incompatible with socialism, I have become associated with Zhang and Luo's activities.

Now, the more I examine my deep thoughts, the more I find its ugliness. I am a person who has received Party education and training for many years, and has participated in revolutionary work under the leadership of the Party. I can doubt and oppose the great anti-counter-revolutionary movement implemented to carry out the revolutionary task; I can bear to smear and attack the Chinese Communist Party and the Party's backbone Party members who spared no blood and sacrifice, struggled hard, never yielded, and led the Chinese people to complete the New Democratic Revolution and embark on the bright road of socialism, and only sympathize with those backward elements affected by the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, thinking that it has not done "all mistakes must be corrected," and even do not hesitate to retaliate against the Party on their behalf; Can my thoughts still be said to be loving the Party, supporting the Party, and not losing the socialist position and the people's position? What exactly do I think I am? Can my thoughts and my remarks be placed together with the Zhang-Luo alliance? The more I think about it, the more I feel the ugliness of my thoughts, and the more I think about it, the more I can only hate myself! I can only admit this mistake to the people and to the Party without any punishment or personal gain. I am willing to accept the China Democratic League's rectification to thoroughly liquidate my mistakes and sins! I am determined to wage a resolute struggle against the rightists to improve myself and redeem my sins to the people! I only have the road of starting anew!

    我要从新做人
    马哲民的发言
    我虽不是出身于地主阶级或资产阶级的家庭，却是从旧社会中来的旧知识分子；旧社会的恶劣生活习惯，沾染很深，小资产阶级的自由主义思想，根深蒂固。虽学习过和写作过关于马克思列宁主义的东西，只算理论上或概念上被接受的教条，没有与工农实际斗争，密切结合，做到为工农服务，并不能改变原来思想的本质。虽参加了一些民主革命运动，徒然加强了小资产阶级的自由主义意识，反而妨害了我底思想，向社会主义前进。所以我过去在学习马克思列宁主义与参加民主革命所作的一切，按照今天社会主义要求来衡量，便成为阻碍自己进步的绊脚石。我必须面对真理，彻底粉碎旧日我底一切，以求在新社会做一个新人。我也必须做到这一点，才能对得起党，对得起人民，对得起自己！
    一
    现在我才比较明确地认识到：我们旧知识分子，到底是否拥护走社会主义的道路？决不是单凭空口白话，或主观愿望和感情作用，而是要在一些根本性的问题上，有清清楚楚的认识，站得稳立场，受得住考验。而这些根本性问题，又以是否拥护中国共产党，信仰中国共产党，为其前提。党是工人阶级革命的先锋队，是代表工人阶级领导中国人民完成民主革命，并进行社会革命的“核心力量”，这是铁的事实。没有中国共产党的领导，便不会有这一切，尤其不会有社会主义建设的实现。
    过去我对于这个问题底表面上的道理，仿佛也能说，并有二、三十年跟着党走的历史，能够说不真实吗？可是，由于事实的考验，深刻地检查，才知道并不完全是那末一回事。譬如我原来是党员，只因不能克服困难，完成党所交给的任务，掉了队，被党开除；后来本有机会，说明当时不得已的情况，争取恢复组织生活，只因怕牺牲，怕丢掉个人自由的生活，对党的同志，故意回避了这个问题。解放以后，我虽向党交代了一切事实，但还不能正视自己的缺点，尚以为个人对党无罪，不向党思想见面，反想回避这种缺点，怕党搔着这种思想上的疮疤——硬说：我对党只是无条件帮忙，帮得多少，算得多少，试看这种严重的思想毛病，还能说把一切献给党，献给革命，献给人民吗？这不是自欺欺人吗？
    因对党的态度不正确，乃使我对党的领导，也有错误的看法。不错，自毛主席领导了中国共产党以后，我对党的政策，基本上是拥护的。同时，我也常常在争取党的同志，共同工作，并将自己的工作，汇报给党的同志（有时是以这样做来逃避工作责任）。但我却往往只强调接受党的政策方针的领导，忽视党的组织领导。我个人并不十分觉得对党负有直接责任，必须经常请示党；甚至于直接和党组织的接触，更是不多。因而就将党的领导，偏重于政策方针，忽视了领导、保证和监督执行这种政策方针的“核心力量”（党组织）；这不仅不能很好的贯彻党的领导，反而容易发生单独行动，脱离党领导的危险。因而把工作看做是党交给我的工作这种意义，是不明确的，有时甚至对党有分庭抗礼的思想；这以今天社会主义的要求来衡量，当然是很大的错误。
    再就对党员的看法说，我也不是从那确实具有无产阶级、对革命、对党的无限忠贞的高贵品质去衡量，而是从那是否有特殊外表才华或所谓能力去认识；甚至把那久经锻炼，质朴无华，不为任何困难低头的老党员，以为是德高而才不大，他们只能对敌冲锋陷阵，而难于胜任更复杂的建设工作。所以和我谈得来的党员，多只限于一些知识分子，很少与工农党员接近。因而对工农党员，根本没有感情，更没有热爱。
    由此可见我的接近党，靠拢党的过程，实在潜伏着很多不正确的思想，对党不满的情绪；假使这种思想，不加克服，更进一步的跟着党走，更进一步的接受党的领导，是不可能的。因而我常有党是党，我是我，不能血肉相连，打成一片的思想。
    二
    同样的问题，在我对待人民民主专政的认识上，也有存在，如果单讲理论，我也可以谈上一大套，但一碰到实际问题，就不那末简单。比方说要明确人民民主专政的性质任务，首先要明确对人民敌人专政的实际意义或革命意义；可是在这一问题上，我就时时因敌我界限划得不够清楚，忘记了敌人对人民的残酷，和人民革命的目的，反而恐怕人民对敌人的过火。如我对待土地改革，镇压反革命、三反、五反，等等，都发生过这种情绪；尤其在对待知识分子的肃反运动，虽然拥护“有反必肃”，却斤斤计较“有错必纠”，以为这方面做得不够，意见很多。而不知道这些运动的伟大意义，就是人民民主专政的本质表现，就是人民革命的目的，决不能与那由运动所带来的某些所谓偏差，相提并论。又比方说：经过社会主义改造和社会主义建设上的伟大成就，人民内部对抗性的矛盾，算是基本上消灭；但人民内部原来是剥削阶级的分子（如地主和反动的资产阶级），以及反革命分子，乃至盗、窃犯等等，固然还有存在，必须发挥专政的作用；就是为发挥工人阶级的领导——党的领导，也应该在集中与专政的作用中表现出来；并且必须只有在这一前提下来扩大民主；而我底思想认识，常侧重于扩大民主生活的方面，以致无形中与资产阶级的虚伪民主思想合流而不觉，这也不是偶然的。
    由上述进到社会主义，必须站稳的立场上，我底思想认识，是犯了原则上的错误；而这种错误，又在对待知识分子的思想改造上，表现出来。党的知识分子政策，我虽在原则上赞成，并不怀疑；但因我对待这一政策的实践，很是不够；我就没有带头作好学习，更没有决心，下到工厂和农村里去，体验工人和农民生活，向他们学习。也即是说，我还没有彻底改造自己的决心和认识；加以自解放以来，我很少参加大的政治改革运动，缺乏思想锻炼的机会；民主党派的生活，缺乏批评自我批评的思想教育，更成了知识分子培养自由主义思想的温床；因而我底那种与社会主义绝不相容的自由主义思想，便容易被保留下来。
    由于我底错误思想之存在，一碰到翻天复地的社会主义革命到来，便经不起考验了。
    最明显的例子，是自章罗联盟，操纵民盟中央，并利用民盟今年三月的全国工作会议，公开进行他们底阴谋布置（据费孝通在大会中的发言，承认在民盟二届代表大会时，便种下了思想毒素，我到还没有检查到，真是糊涂）。会议后半，他们还分途请客，大肆拉拢民盟的地方骨干。章在请我们的吃饭中（我是吴春选约去的，说是开知识分子问题工作组会，到会的人有楚图南、费孝通、吴景超、沈志远、钱端升、冯素陶和我），便谈了这样的一些话，他大意说：“我体会毛主席讲话的精神，是中国有六亿人口的大国，他们底吃饭、穿衣、住房子、走路，乃至生育问题都要管到，这是空前未有的大担子，恐怕连毛主席原先都没有想到。”又说：“中国最多的是民主主义者，最少的是社会主义者，但却要走社会主义的道路，这就是中国人民内部矛盾中最大的矛盾；如果中国社会主义者，不给予充分的民主，那民主主义者怎样发挥积极性去服从社会主义呢？”谈到这里，他便大谈其“长期共存，互相监督”方针，必须贯彻；并说：“他所提出的给予人民政协的监督权，就是贯彻这个方针的方式之一。”章还说：“我从习仲勋那儿探听了一下口风，说是‘长期共存，互相监督’很不易搞，所以我在这次会议中，极力主张以‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’为中心任务，有了这，则对‘长期共存，互相监督’创造了条件，否则只是空谈，兑不了现。”章还说：“毛在上海对老朋友谈，他宁愿不干主席来搞‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’。”后来章又说：“民主主义者人数有几亿，我们知识分子就有几百万。”云云（他底这些话，不是连续讲的，现在就我所能记忆的，加以组织而成；并且因我是迟到早退，可能有些话没听到）。后来章伯钧歪曲传达毛主席4月30日在最高国务会议上的讲话中，又特别将毛主席对社会主义与民主主义的问题的讲话，作了“断章取义”的传达，以加强他底这种谬论的力量。
    因为我那时的思想情况，是错误的认为国内的阶级关系，既基本消灭，党的领导与人民民主专政，在对内关系上可以相对的缩小，内部的民主生活，可以相对的扩大，没有深刻地了解，社会主义民主的发展，是与加强党和工人阶级的领导不可分的；因而我和章底思想，没有本质上的差别；所以我听了他底话，受了他底毒而不觉。
    其实如用马克思列宁主义的眼光来仔细分析一下，就可以知道章所说的社会主义与民主主义的矛盾，当然就是工人阶级与非工人阶级的矛盾，章所说：社会主义少而民主主义多，当然就是工人阶级少而非工人阶级多；他所说如果社会主义者不给予民主主义者的充分民主，便不能使民主主义者去服从社会主义；当然要工人阶级承认非工人阶级的充分民主，否则非工人阶级便不能服务社会主义了。同时，他还把这个问题与“长期共存，互相监督”相结合，那就更明显地指代表社会主义的，只有共产党，而其他民主党派，则代表非工人阶级；并且是前者人少而后者人多；正可以利用这个矛盾，聚集起来，向共产党争天下。这样一来，他们憎恨党的领导，而曰“党天下”，憎恨工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政为“三害的根源”等等，当然就不奇怪了。并且可以想到，章底这套荒谬理论，实在可以将一切反私营工商业、与农业和手工业的社会主义改造的右派思想，贯通一气，造成他所妄想的，联合向党进攻的形势，最后达到他消灭党的领导，消灭社会主义，实行反动统治复辟的目的。根据章底这种谬论，提出了“政治设计院”以对党“分庭抗礼”和“平分春色”，恐怕他还觉得是很客气了。章的所谓“爱社会主义又爱民主自由”，大概是从这个反动思想上来的；难道章竟不知道没有党的领导，走社会主义道路，便要亡国，还谈什么民主自由！
    罗那时所鼓吹的政治纲领，突出的是对知识分子要“礼贤下士，三顾茅庐”，与费孝通底“早春天气”等谬论为基础；必须给知识分子以特别地位和温暖，而不强调改造。以罗底这种政治纲领，和章底那政治纲领来比较，仿佛是各不相侔，且有小巫大巫之别；但因后来发展到罗提“平反委员会”，叶笃义底组织知识分子大政党和“党退学校”以及“放弃科学的领导”等等来看，实又成为章罗联盟，利用民盟来进行反党反社会主义的纲领的重要组成部分。
    我当时因章所谈的和我原来的意思，有些共鸣（实则那时还不知其真正涵义），及罗底知识分子观点，系为民盟工作会议中一些人的共同见解（出发点或各有不同），我便将这种毒素，带回武汉，没有加以正确分析批判的传达了一些给湖北省的盟员；并以我自己原来的错误思想，结合章、罗的思想，来指导我底言行。
  在大“放”大“鸣”中，章、罗一方面是派人到各大城市去点火；另方面是在北京大发谬论，提出“政治设计院”“平反委员会”的要求，及喊出了“反对党天下”，“党退出学校”，“无产阶级专政，是三害根源”等口号，影响各地盟员和盟外人士，莫辨是非，乱鸣一通，淆乱人心。虽因武汉市大专学校的“鸣”“放”较迟，尚未进入到这些大问题的阶段；然思想上已有这些谬论作基础，即使在对待一般问题上（如对肃反问题），也能热火朝天。
    最恶毒的是章伯钧故意歪曲4月30日毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，说毛主席建议首先取消学校党委制等，益促使武汉市的第一阶段“鸣”“放”的歪风达到高潮，形成猖狂向党进攻的形势，并把民盟湖北省委会在“鸣”“放”中的活动，涂上了和章、罗活动一脉贯通的色彩，我是主任委员，当然要负责。
    同时，还使我自己发出了反党、反社会主义的言论，给予了党和人民以很大的损失。例如：我主张允许知识分子在肃反中吃了苦头的发发牢骚，吐吐苦水；我认为我们学校在肃反中有所谓杀人逻辑；又如：我认为老干部容易是经验主义，新党员容易是教条主义；我认为某些党员，有特权思想，不是为人民服务，而是人民为他服务；我说：“有人说入党的有木头人”；再如：我说：“党的某些教条主义，能和党外的机会主义，交锋一下也好”；我说：“6月8日人民日报的社论，有些教条主义，要一棍子打死”；我说：“学校党的人事部门，有人说是阎王殿”等等。
    这就足以证明我那时的思想，已在事实上做了章、罗思想的俘虏；我底言论，也事实上成了章、罗的应声虫。只因我这次参加大会，学习了毛主席的讲话，和周总理的报告，得到湖北代表小组各位代表的热忱帮助，尤其党员同志的帮助，以及听了各位代表在大会中反击右派的惊心动魄的发言等等，并经过我自己的思想检查，才理解到章罗联盟，正是为完成反党反社会主义的共同任务，而为反动统治复辟，铺平道路；其结果只有使中国人民永劫不复。而我也因为存在有与社会主义绝不相容的自由主义思想，乃对章、罗活动，发生关联。
    现在我愈检查我底思想深处，愈发现它的丑恶。我是多年受过党的教育培养，并在党领导下参加革命工作的人，我对那为贯彻革命任务，而执行的伟大的肃反运动，能够怀疑和反对；我对那不惜流血牺牲，艰苦奋斗，百折不回，领导中国人民，完成新民主主义革命，并走上社会主义光明大道的中国共产党，和党底骨干党员，能忍心加以污蔑、攻击，而独独同情于因肃反运动所波及的那些落后分子，以为没有做到“有错必纠”，甚至不惜代表他们向党反噬；我底这种思想，还能说是爱党，拥护党，没有失掉社会主义立场、人民立场吗？我自己把自己究竟看做是什么呀？我底这种思想，我底这种言论，把我划在章罗联盟一起，还有一点不应该吗？我愈想愈觉我底思想的丑恶，我愈想愈只有痛恨自己！我只有不辞任何惩罚，不计任何个人利害来向人民，向党承认这种错误。我甘愿承受民盟的整风来对我底错误和罪过，加以彻底清算！我决心要对右派进行坚决的斗争，以提高自己，并向人民赎回我底罪愆！我只有从新做人的一条道路！
