    The Yellow River Experiences Its First Flood Peak

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 17th: At 4:00 AM yesterday, the Qin Chang hydrological station on the Yellow River recorded a flood peak flow of 5,000 cubic meters per second. This is the largest flood peak to appear on the Yellow River since the beginning of the flood season this year. In recent days, there has been continuous rainfall in the main and tributary areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and a larger flood peak is expected to appear on the Yellow River.
    When this flood peak reaches areas downstream of Dongbatou in Lankao County, water levels in some places will reach the warning level, and water will overflow the low-lying beach gullies in some areas.
    Recently, there has been continuous rainfall in the main stream of the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the basins of major tributaries such as the Jing River, Wei River, Beiluo River, Yi River, and Nanluo River. Some areas have even experienced torrential rain.
    Before the flood peak reached Qin Chang, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters issued a notice requiring Henan and Shandong provinces to prepare flood control materials, mobilize an appropriate number of flood control teams to patrol the dikes, assign special personnel to guard dangerous sections, and pay attention to changes in the river’s course.
    Currently, there are more than 280 hydrological and meteorological stations along the main and tributary streams of the Yellow River, reporting rainfall and water conditions to the Yellow River Headquarters day and night. More than 210,000 people along the Yellow River in Henan and Shandong provinces are closely monitoring changes in the water situation.

    战胜洪水  力争丰收
    黄河出现首次洪峰
    据新华社郑州17日电  黄河秦厂水文站在昨天四时出现了五千秒公方流量的洪峰，这是今年入汛以来，黄河出现的比较大的一次洪峰。这几天，黄河中、下游干、支流地区，都在连续降雨，黄河将要出现更大的洪峰。
    这次洪峰到兰考县东坝头以下，有些地方要达警戒水位，有些低洼滩地的串沟要过水。
    近日，黄河中游的干流和泾、渭、北洛、伊、南洛等大支流流域连续降雨，有些地方还出现暴雨。
    在洪峰到秦厂以前，黄河防汛总指挥部就发出通知，要求河南和山东两省做好防汛料物的准备，调动适当数目的防汛队伍上堤，险工段要有专人防守，注意河势的变化。
    现在黄河干、支流上，有二百八十多个水文和气象站，日夜不停的向黄河总指挥部报告雨情和水情。河南和山东两省黄河沿线，已有二十一万多人，在密切注视着水情的变化。
