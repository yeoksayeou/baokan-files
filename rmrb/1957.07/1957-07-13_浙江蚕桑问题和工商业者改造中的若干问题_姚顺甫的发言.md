I wholeheartedly support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen at this conference.

After studying Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and listening to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, I received a profound socialist education, which enabled me to better distinguish between right and wrong and recognize the path forward. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has achieved brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction in a short period of just over seven years, successes unprecedented in Chinese history. We industrialists and businessmen, like the people of the whole country, are cheering for the victory of the great socialist cause. However, some people do not feel this way; these people are the right-wing elements who oppose the Party and socialism. They do not want socialism and attempt to restore capitalism. They shamelessly use the legal status given to them by the people to carry out illegal activities, spreading malicious words and deeds everywhere, causing some ideologically confused industrialists and businessmen to be contaminated by the poison of the right-wing elements, producing many fallacies that are not conducive to their own transformation. Now, Premier Zhou's report has made a solemn criticism, awakening us. The vast majority of us industrialists and businessmen, together with the people of the whole country, are actively engaged in the just struggle against the right-wing elements. This struggle is becoming more and more widespread and profound. We industrialists and businessmen are undergoing severe tests and training in such a vibrant political life. We must be more vigilant, draw clear lines, stand firm, and resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end. We must forever unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen our study, actively transform ourselves, and continue to contribute all our strength to the great socialist cause.

I would also like to talk about two issues below: one is the issue of sericulture in Zhejiang, and the other is some problems existing in the transformation of industrial and commercial businessmen.

The Sericulture Issue in Zhejiang

First, let’s discuss the sericulture issue in Zhejiang.

I. The Future of the Silk Industry

The silk industry occupies an important position in China's national economy. It has a history of more than four thousand years, with production areas spanning twenty-three provinces, and once ranked first in the world. In the few years since liberation, it has played a significant role in promoting socialist industrialization. Each ton of raw silk exported can be exchanged for ninety-two tons of steel. From 1950 to 1954, the five years in which the country could export silk (not counting domestic sales), it could be exchanged for all the steel rails of the country's railways at that time. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, if all the silk produced in the eight years since liberation were exported, it could be exchanged for 2.54 million tons of steel, enough to lay 148 Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. This figure is quite astonishing.

However, many comrades are worried about the future of China's silk industry, believing that as the production of rayon increases and its quality improves, will the future of silk be bleak and hopeless? Will rayon replace it? I think this concern is unnecessary. I will now explain this from the following aspects.

First, from the perspective of people's preferences and needs. In terms of exports, the demand for silk from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has been growing year by year. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, if 1952 is taken as 100, the demand for raw silk in 1956 increased to 150, and the demand for silk fabrics increased to 209. Therefore, China's current supply is far from meeting their requirements. The Soviet Union and other new countries can only satisfy 40% of their demand for silk and silk fabrics. Moreover, they all require real silk fabrics and do not have high requirements for rayon interlaced products. Especially due to the victory of the Party's peaceful diplomatic policy, the export market is gradually expanding. Twenty-eight countries in Asia and Africa and sixteen countries in Western Europe have trade relations with China. Moreover, the US imperialist embargo policy has suffered a shameful failure, and the supply of exports is becoming more and more tense.

The domestic sales situation is also the same, with demand exceeding supply. Taking Zhejiang's situation as an example, the higher authorities designated Zhejiang to be responsible for the supply task, as well as Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian provinces, and it has always been difficult to arrange. If we want to meet the requirements of the four provinces, the supply volume must be increased three times. This shows that domestic sales are also very tight.

In particular, we should estimate that with the increasing development of the country's socialist construction, the people's living standards are also constantly improving, and the demand for silk fabrics is gradually increasing. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, the current demand for silk fabrics is 2.8 meters per person per year, and Poland is even more, at 4.3 meters. In China, it is pitifully low. If all silk fabrics are used for domestic sales, each person will not be allocated even 0.15 meters. Therefore, to gradually meet the needs of the people, it is necessary to vigorously develop sericulture and produce a large amount of silk fabrics.

Secondly, everyone knows that rayon has shortcomings. General rayon has poor fastness, cannot withstand friction, and has high extensibility. Taking synthetic fiber nylon as an example, although the strength is good, the moisture absorption rate is very poor, only about 4.5%. Therefore, it is not very suitable for summer and autumn clothing. However, we must also affirm the advantages of rayon nylon. These advantages are also being used by silk. For example, using rayon to weave the flowers of silk fabrics can be dyed into different colors, or using interlacing to increase the variety of silk fabrics, improve the beauty of silk fabrics, and meet the needs of the people. Therefore, rayon is not terrible. On the contrary, we demand that rayon factories be established quickly in the motherland to improve the quality to meet the needs of silk weaving raw materials.

Here I would also like to explain the greater significance of silk production. Taking Zhejiang's situation as an example, according to the three five-year plans, the target for cocoon production by 1967 is 5 million dan. Made into raw silk, of which half of the raw materials are woven into silk fabrics, the total output value is about 1.2 billion yuan. The grain production target for Zhejiang is 32 billion jin, with an output value of about 2.2 billion yuan. However, the planting area occupied is different. Mulberry gardens only account for 12.5% of the total planting area in Zhejiang Province (now only accounting for 3%). Therefore, I think sufficient attention should be paid to sericulture economic crops.

II. Current Situation and Existing Problems

According to the above situation, it shows that China's silk industry occupies a certain position in the national economy and is of extremely important significance for promoting the country's socialist industrialization. However, the development speed of Zhejiang's silk industry is slow. For example, taking the highest annual output of fresh cocoons before the war (1931) as 100, it only reached 39.82% in 1956. Compared with other economic crops, such as grain, the output has exceeded the pre-war level, and the output of tea has also approached the pre-war level. In comparison, the silk industry is obviously far behind. As everyone knows, Zhejiang is a silk base, but last year 830,000 silkworm eggs were distributed in spring, and this year only 795,000 silkworm eggs were distributed. About 60,000 silkworm eggs were wasted due to insufficient mulberry leaves, and the price of mulberry leaves rose to 20 yuan per dan. This spring, only 80% of the planned cocoon purchase could be completed. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are in danger of shutting down and waiting for materials. The scene of this base is so declining. The reason is that silk production has not been placed in an appropriate position. Therefore, the situation of grain and mulberry leaves "fighting" has arisen. The main reason is that the one-sided emphasis on grain production and the inadequate rationality of the three-fixed policies for sericulture areas have created the idea of "emphasizing grain and neglecting mulberry" among silkworm farmers, who have to use their brains to turn mulberry gardens into the "insurance land" for the three-fixed policy and intercrop other crops, seriously affecting the output of mulberry leaves. Coupled with the small amount of fertilizer applied and the excessive number of mulberry picking, the output of mulberry leaves is bound to decline year by year, strangling the precious lives of countless silkworms. However, the harvest of intercropped crops in mulberry gardens cannot compensate for the significant loss of cocoon production. Zhejiang Province was originally a grain-deficient province. Increasing grain production is of course the top priority, but the significance of vigorously developing silk production and exchanging more foreign exchange to support industrialization cannot be ignored either. Insufficient mastery of adapting to local conditions will lead to deviations. The area of mulberry gardens only accounts for 4% of the grain area. The "grain and mulberry fighting" can really be avoided. If governments at all levels regularly pay serious attention to it and place silk production in a necessary and appropriate position, Zhejiang's silk production would not have suffered such serious losses this year. This is a problem of subjectivism, and we must deeply accept this lesson.

According to the silkworm egg distribution record in 1954, the nine cocoon-producing counties in Jiaxing Prefecture accounted for 87.4% of the province's total. It can be seen that Zhejiang's silk production is mainly concentrated in this prefecture. As long as we are determined, we can lead it well, manage it well, and there must be a way to solve it technically.

The deviation is not only "grain and mulberry fighting", but also reflected in the cocoon purchase price issue. As early as last year, I proposed the opinion of rationally adjusting the cocoon purchase price (Proposal No. 86). The Fifth Office of the State Council also sent personnel to Zhejiang to investigate, but the Ministry of Agriculture decided based on the State Council's Cai Yun Zi No. 34 "Instructions on Cocoon Purchase Prices": "According to the current cocoon purchase price level, the income of farmers planting mulberry and raising silkworms is compared with the income of planting grain. Except for Sichuan Province, which seems to be lower, the remaining provinces are generally not low. The national spring cocoon price in 1957, except for Sichuan Province...increased by 20.7%, the remaining provinces still maintain the 1956 level and will not be increased." (Please refer to "Report on the Handling of Proposals" No. 5, page 18). What is the fact? All the representatives, please listen to the voices of the silkworm farmers in Zhejiang! They said: Two cocoons are worth more than one loquat, and six cocoons are worth more than one plum. The price reduction is not reasonable enough, as one can imagine. It is precisely because of the unreasonable cocoon price that some silkworm farmers dump silkworms and sell mulberry leaves, because this year the price of mulberry leaves has reached a maximum of 20 yuan per dan. However, the vast majority of silkworm farmers buy mulberry leaves at more than 10 yuan per dan to feed silkworms, and sell cocoons to the country at a loss according to the listed price. There are too many touching examples of this kind of love for the motherland and the silk industry. Some silkworm farmers keep cocoons for their own use and change them into silk cotton (good cocoons are used to make silk cotton, which is a waste of talent. One hundred jin of cocoons can make 15 jin of silk cotton, which can be sold for 8 yuan per jin according to the Zhongbai price, and you can get 120 yuan; if you calculate it according to the free market price of 12 yuan to 16 yuan per jin, an average of 14 yuan, you can get 210 yuan, but the price of 100 jin of cocoons is only worth about 90 yuan). Dumping silkworms to sell mulberry leaves and keeping them for cotton stripping, the losses caused are so great! This is the consequence of impractical price policies. The highest yield of mulberry per mu in Zhejiang mulberry gardens is 30 dan, and the lowest is only 1 to 2 dan, with an average of less than 5 dan. If the yield is 30 dan, the cocoon price can be reduced accordingly; but with an average yield of 459 jin per mu, the cocoon price must be appropriately increased to stimulate production and encourage silkworm farmers' enthusiasm. Why don't the competent authorities conduct a good investigation and research on these actual situations? I think the specific situation should be analyzed specifically. The income from cocoons cannot be simply compared with the income from planting grain. It should be compared with other economic crops and also with the prices of other daily commodities. Here we must also focus on looking at the changes in Zhejiang Province in the past seven years by raising the cocoon price and raising the cocoon quality and the uniformity of the raw silk itself. It is worth comparing. The cocoon price in 1956 increased by 21% compared with 1950, the cocoon quality improved, reducing the reeling discount by 24.3%, and improving the raw silk uniformity by 11% (these changes are of course due to the Party's correct leadership, improving the level of science and technology, improving enterprise management, and giving play to the enthusiasm of labor production), but the key to improving cocoon quality and reducing the cost of raw silk cannot be easily ignored, and it is necessary to combine the actual situation in each region, repeatedly study, and carefully set the purchase price. If you don't do this, you will be divorced from reality, you will be subjectivism, and you will cause serious losses to the country and the people. We believe that we should learn lessons and correct biases.

III. Future Opinions

It is recommended that the central government help solve five problems, and please the central government to stipulate the tasks of Zhejiang's silk production:

1.  The central government is requested to clearly arrange the due position of Zhejiang's silk production.
2.  In order to vigorously develop the silk production cause, the central government is requested to reduce Zhejiang Province's grain task by 140 million jin, that is, strictly prohibit intercropping crops in about 1.4 million mu of mulberry gardens; and reasonably supply silkworm farmers with rations in the key areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou sericulture economic crops.
3.  Ensure the supply of 11,500 tons of special chemical fertilizers for sericulture every year (7,000 tons were stipulated in 1956).
4.  Before the unit area yield of mulberry gardens is evenly improved, it is requested to rationally adjust the cocoon price according to the actual situation to encourage the production enthusiasm of silkworm farmers in planting mulberry and raising silkworms.
5.  It is requested to allocate all of Zhejiang's cocoon improvement fees to Zhejiang for enriching scientific research and training silk and silk technology personnel.

Clarify that Zhejiang's silk production must strive to complete the production task of 1.2 million dan of fresh cocoons before 1962!

Some Problems in the Transformation of Industrial and Commercial Businessmen

Secondly, let's talk about some problems existing in the transformation of industrial and commercial businessmen.

In the eight years and more, thanks to the care and education of the Party and Chairman Mao for industrial and commercial businessmen, and thanks to the correctness of the peaceful transformation policy, we have already completed the first decisive step on the road of socialist transformation and are currently continuing to move in the direction of transitioning to laborers. However, there are still some problems on the road forward. For the sake of socialist transformation and socialist construction, I put forward the following four issues and suggest that the government consider and study them.

First, the issue of life and death, retirement, and resignation welfare for private real staff. This is a complex issue, but it is, after all, an issue that urgently needs to be resolved, because it is related to the vital interests of the vast number of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businessmen, and the existence of the problem is enough to affect the enthusiasm and creativity of private personnel. For example, some female industrial and commercial businessmen have no clear regulations on maternity leave, and wages must be deducted for taking leave (some enterprises pay 50%). In order to live, they have to work a few days after giving birth, which affects their health. Another example is sick leave wages. In the previous period, many opinions were expressed regarding the issue of seniority. Recently, the State Council stipulated that it should not be calculated based on seniority, but should be paid at 50% to 70%, but in specific implementation, it is still difficult to divide the ranks. Some people cannot work due to work-related accidents and have to deduct their wages. They reflect that they do not receive reasonable care for their active work. For example, in the Taixinxiang Ji welding factory in Hangzhou's heavy industry, a private person named Li Shinian was very active in his work. Later, he injured his hand due to work and could not enjoy medical treatment. He also had his wages deducted during his leave. Since then, he has refused to work actively. Similar situations are by no means a minority. Therefore, some people, for fear of deducting their wages, go to work with illnesses and do things perfunctorily, which is detrimental to both the public and private. In his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress last year, Vice Premier Chen Yun pointed out: "Private personnel whose enterprises have verified assets exceeding 2,000 yuan but have difficulties can also refer to the treatment of employees in their own enterprises for their own medical treatment and wage payment methods during sick leave." However, according to the feedback, the implementation is too rigid and those who are really in difficulty cannot be resolved. Another example is the post-mortem problems. Since there are no clear regulations, the lives of some people's families are in difficulty. For example, after the death of Gan Shanren, a private person in the Xinhua Paint Store in Hangzhou, the monthly fixed interest was less than four yuan, and the lives of a family of five were in difficulty. Another example is that some joint ventures have bloated organizations and overstaffing. Private personnel who are old and weak can retire and resign according to regulations, but there are no specific methods to ensure that the elderly are supported, so it is difficult to mobilize them. For these old and weak people, "working with illness" is not good for both the public and private. Therefore, it has brought certain obstacles to streamlining the organization and reorganizing personnel, and has also suffered certain losses to the development of production and increased accumulation. Or some people think that some areas have now held mutual aid funds for life, and when there are problems such as life, old age, illness and death, they can be solved in the mutual aid funds, but this is only a stopgap measure, and the holding of mutual aid funds for life is not universal enough in various places. The fundamental solution is to study a set of rules and regulations so that the lives of the vast number of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businessmen can rely on. Closely related to this issue is the seniority issue of private personnel, because some life welfare measures, especially retirement, resignation, or death, will involve this issue. I think the seniority of private personnel can be calculated from the date of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Because: After the liberation, industrial and commercial businessmen accepted the leadership of the working class politically, supported the Common Program and the Constitution, opposed imperialism, and participated in various patriotic movements; economically, they accepted the management of the People's Government and the leadership of the state-owned economy, and successively embarked on various forms of state capitalism. In the past few years, they have played a certain role in supplying products and urban-rural exchanges, paying taxes, and training talents. These roles are conducive to the socialist construction cause. Since it is conducive to the socialist construction cause, it is actually serving socialism (of course, it also creates the necessary conditions for us to accept transformation). If this statement is not wrong, then it is more in line with the facts and the principle of redemption policy to generally calculate the seniority from the date of the founding of the country (different situations must be made with different specific regulations). Therefore, I think that making reasonable regulations on the seniority issue can not only eliminate many concerns of private personnel, but also help mobilize all possible positive factors.

Second, the issue of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businessmen getting rid of their "capitalist" hats. According to the survey in Hangzhou, excluding eight large factories, the number of shareholders in the clearing and asset verification households is 6,775 (including non-working shareholders), of which 5,027 have capital of less than 2,000 yuan, accounting for 74% of the total number. The average capital per person is 479 yuan, and the average fixed interest income per person per year is less than 24 yuan, and no more than 2 yuan per month. In terms of meaning, this 2 yuan income has lost the role of "a little supplement." Their main source of livelihood at present is to rely on wage income, and their eagerness to get rid of their hats is understandable. We follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Small and medium-sized businesses get rid of their hats, do not publish in newspapers, do not engage in climaxes"; however, the vast number of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businessmen's demand for giving up fixed interest and getting rid of their hats is like a severe drought waiting for rain. On this issue, we who are responsible for the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce feel it is very difficult to handle. There are no rules to deal with it, and there is nothing to rely on; if it is not dealt with, the public is eager and it is difficult to convince. In order to be more conducive to transformation and beneficial to serving socialism, therefore, I would like to solemnly propose to the government: For private personnel who have positive performance in their work and have made significant progress in their thinking, please the government consider the issue of getting rid of their hats in advance, make a clear decision to meet their long-cherished wishes, so as to give play to their positive role.

As for industrial and commercial businessmen whose enterprises have verified assets of more than 2,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, some of them also want to get rid of their hats. According to the survey in Hangzhou, there are 1,375 industrial and commercial businessmen of this type, accounting for 20.3% of the total number of 6,775 households verified by clearing and asset verification (if the number of private personnel with clearing and asset verification of less than 2,000 yuan is added, it accounts for 94.3% of the total number of asset verification households). The average asset per person is 4,470 yuan, and the average fixed interest income per person per year is 223 yuan, which is less than 20 yuan per month on average. Among these people, there are also quite a few people who want to give up fixed interest and get rid of their hats. I also suggest that the government study this issue.

Third, the issue of the titles of capitalist agents and family workers. Since the implementation of public-private joint ventures in the entire industry, the nature of enterprises has undergone fundamental changes. Capitalists have become public officials of the country, but the titles of capitalist agents and family workers still exist. Taking capitalist agents as an example, the name has not changed, but there is no capital to act on behalf of. Their income is entirely dependent on wages, and most of these personnel have production technology and management capabilities. Taking family workers as an example, in the past, most of them engaged in housework on the one hand and assisted in enterprise work on the other. After the climax, after economic restructuring, they have all been full-time in enterprise work. As can be seen from the above, capitalist agents and family workers are nominal according to the actual situation. Since it is only a "false name," it is better to abolish this title. It is more in line with reality and can play a positive role. I also believe that for those with higher ideological awareness among them, I suggest that the trade union may absorb them (even if they work in the same factory store as private personnel), which is beneficial to the socialist construction cause.

Fourth, the issue of more work, more gain for small business owners. After the government made overall arrangements for small business owners last year, and received appropriate care in terms of sources of goods, funds, and taxes, except for a few who still have some difficulties, generally speaking, they have all improved and turned from losses to profits. However, since there are no clear regulations on the principle of more work, more gain, some small business owners are still paying according to the past wages (the wages of small business owners are generally relatively low), and the surplus is used as the accumulation of the enterprise; while some small business owners believe that since it is more work, more gain, they have a slight surplus, and they spend it arbitrarily. This has caused adverse political effects, believing that honest people suffer losses and naughty people are cheap. I believe that in order to encourage active management, the principle of paying according to work and more work, more gain should be implemented. Therefore, it is suggested whether to make specific regulations with reference to the spirit of the past Four Horses Dividing Fat method, how the profits are distributed, please the government study and decide according to the actual situation. In this way, on the one hand, taxes can be increased, and on the other hand, the enthusiasm of small business owners for management can be encouraged, and those who are passively managed can be educated, which is beneficial to the transformation of small vendors.

I believe that the above four issues are all related to the further transformation of industrial and commercial businessmen, and also involve the guidelines and policies. For the sake of socialism, I am unwilling to remain silent and provide government references.

专栏：

    浙江蚕桑问题和工商业者改造中的若干问题
    姚顺甫的发言
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真秘书长在本次会议上的报告。
    我学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，又听了周总理的政府工作报告，使我受到极其深刻的社会主义教育，能更好地辨别是非，认清前进的道路。我们国家在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，短短七年多的时间，社会主义革命和社会主义建设已经取得了中国历史上所没有过的光辉成就，我们工商业者的心情同全国人民一样，为伟大的社会主义事业胜利而欢呼。可是也有些人的心情不是如此，这些人就是反党、反社会主义的右派分子。他们不要社会主义，企图复辟资本主义，无耻的利用人民给他们的合法地位，进行非法的活动，到处散布心怀恶意的言行，致使一部分思想模糊的工商业者沾染着右派分子的毒素，产生出许多不利于自己改造的谬论。现在周总理报告中已经作了严正的批判，唤醒了我们。我们极大多数的工商业者同全国人民一道，积极投入反右派分子的正义斗争。这个斗争愈来愈广泛，愈来愈深刻了，我们工商业者在这样富有活力的政治生活中，受着严重的考验和锻炼，我们必须提高警惕，划清界限，站稳立场，同右派分子坚决斗争到底；我们要永远团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加强学习，积极自我改造，继续为伟大的社会主义事业贡献出一切力量。
    我下面还想谈两个问题。一为浙江蚕桑问题，一为有关工商业者改造中存在的若干问题。
    浙江蚕桑问题
    先谈关于浙江蚕桑问题。
    一、蚕丝事业的前途
    蚕丝业在我国国民经济中占有重要的地位。已有四千余年历史，产区遍及二十三省，曾经占世界第一位。解放几年来，对促进社会主义工业化起着很大作用。出口生丝每吨可换回钢材九十二吨，从一九五○年至一九五四年的五年中，全国可出口的丝绸（内销不计在内），可换回当时全国铁路的全部钢轨。以浙江一省来说，解放八年来丝绸产量如果全部出口，可换回钢材二百五十四万吨，可以铺设一百四十八条沪杭铁路。这一数字是相当惊人的。
    但是，也有不少的同志替我国蚕丝事业忧虑，认为：人造丝生产愈来愈多了，品质愈来愈进步了，蚕丝前途是否会黯淡无望？人造丝是否会取而代之？我认为这种忧虑是不必要的，现在从以下几方面来说明。
    第一，从人民的爱好和需要来看。在外销方面，苏联及各人民民主国家对丝绸的需要逐年有所增长，以苏联为例：如以一九五二年为一百，一九五六年生丝需要增长为一百五十，绸缎需要增长为二百零九，因而目前我国的供应，远不能满足他们的要求，苏、新国家要丝、要绸，仅能满足他们要求的百分之四十。而且都要求真丝绸缎，对人造丝交织品要求不高。特别是由于党的和平外交政策的胜利，外销市场正在逐渐扩大，亚非地区有二十八个国家，远洋西欧有十六个国家，同我国互通贸易。何况美帝的禁运政策已经遭到可耻的失败，外销供应更趋紧张。
    在内销方面也同样是供不应求，以浙江情况来说，上级指定浙江负责供应任务，还有江西、安徽、福建三省，一直处于难以安排的情况中，如果要满足四省的要求，则供应量还要增加三倍。这说明内销也是十分紧张的。
    特别我们应该估计到，随着国家社会主义建设的日益发展，人民生活水平也不断提高，绸缎的需要逐步增加。以苏联为例，目前丝织品的需要水平每人每年为二点八公尺，波兰更多，为四点三公尺。而在我们中国则少得可怜，把全部的丝绸都用来内销，每人分配不到一点五公寸。因此，要逐步满足人民的需要，必然要大力发展蚕桑，生产大量丝绸。
    其次，大家都知道，人造丝是有缺点的，一般的人造丝，牢度不好，经不起摩擦，伸缩性大；以合成纤维尼隆来说，强力虽好，但吸湿率很差，只有百分之四点五左右，因此对夏秋服装并不很适宜。但也要肯定人造丝尼隆的优点，这种优点，也正在被蚕丝所利用着，例如用人造丝来织造绸缎的花朵，可以染成不同颜色，或者用交织来增多绸缎品种，提高了绸缎美观，满足了人民的需要，所以人造丝并不可怕，相反的我们要求在祖国赶快建立人造丝厂，提高品质来满足丝织原料的需要。
    在这里我还想说明一下，蚕丝生产更重大的意义，拿浙江情况来说，按三个五年计划，到一九六七年产茧指标为五百万担，制成生丝，其中以半数原料织成绸缎合计产值约十二亿元，而浙江粮食生产指标为三百二十亿斤，产值为二十二亿元左右，但所占种植面积则不同，桑园仅占浙江全省种植面积的百分之十二点五（现在只占百分之三），所以，我认为对蚕丝经济作物应该有足够的重视。
    二、当前情况及存在问题
    根据上述情况，说明我国蚕丝事业在国民经济中占有一定的地位，对促进国家的社会主义工业化有极其重要的意义。但是，浙江蚕丝事业发展的速度是缓慢的。如以战前（一九三一年）鲜茧的最高年产量为一百，到一九五六年只达到百分之三十九点八二。同其他经济作物来比较，如粮食等产量已经超过战前水平，茶叶等产量也接近战前水平，相互比较，蚕丝事业显然远远落在后面了。人所共知，浙江是一个蚕丝基地，但去年春蚕发种八十三万张，今年只发七十九万五千张，还因桑叶不足而倒蚕约六万张，桑叶价格涨至二十元一市担，今春收购蚕茧只能完成计划的百分之八十，江浙两省现有丝厂将有停工待料的危险。这一基地的景象竟如此衰落，究其原因，在于对蚕丝生产没有被摆在恰当的地位，因此，便产生了粮食同桑叶“打架”的情况。主要原因在于片面强调粮食增产，对蚕桑区域的三定政策的定产不够合理，造成蚕农“重粮轻桑”的思想，不得不动脑筋，把桑园变成了三定政策定产的“保险地”间作了其他作物，严重地影响了桑叶的产量。加上施肥量很少，采桑次数又过多，桑叶产量势必逐年低落，扼杀了无数蚕宝宝的可贵生命。但是桑园间作物的收获，远远不能抵偿蚕茧减产的重大损失。浙江省本来是一个缺粮省份，增产粮食当然是头等重要的，但对大力发展蚕丝生产，换取更多的外汇支援工业化的意义同样不可忽视，没有足够掌握因地制宜，就会出偏差，桑园面积仅占粮食面积百分之四，“粮桑打架”实在是可以避免的。如果各级政府经常认真重视起来，把蚕桑生产放在必要的适当的地位，浙江蚕桑生产今年不会遭到如此严重的损失，这是主观主义的毛病，要深刻的接受这个教训。
    根据一九五四年发种纪录，嘉兴专区的九个产茧县占全省的百分之八十七点四，可见浙江蚕桑生产主要集中在这个专区，只要下决心是可以领导得好的，管理得好的，技术上也肯定是有办法的。
    偏差不只是“粮桑打架”，还反映在蚕茧收购价格问题上。早在去年，我曾提出了合理调整蚕茧收购价格的意见（提案第八十六号），国务院五办也曾派员到浙江来调查，但农业部根据国务院财云字第三十四号“关于蚕茧收购价格的指示”决定说：“按照目前蚕茧的收购价格水平，农民种桑养蚕的收益同种粮食的收益比较，除四川省显得较低外，其余各省一般说来已不算低。一九五七年全国春茧价格除四川省……提高百分之二十点七外，其余各省仍维持一九五六年的水平，不再调高”。
  （请参阅“提案办理情形报告”第五号第十八页）。事实怎样呢？全体代表们，请听听浙江蚕农的呼声吧！他们说：二颗茧子比一颗枇杷，六颗茧子比一颗梅子。减价不够合理，可想而知了。正因为茧价的不合理，有些蚕农倒掉蚕儿，出卖桑叶，因为今年桑叶价最高到达每市担二十元，但是极大部分蚕农是以十余元一担的桑叶买来饲蚕，照牌价出卖茧子，硬着头皮亏本给国家，像这种爱祖国、爱蚕丝事业的心情，使人感动的事例太多了。有些蚕农留茧自用，改作丝棉（好茧做丝棉，是大材小用。一百斤蚕茧可做丝棉十五斤，按中百牌价每斤八元，可得一百二十元；如按自由市场价格每斤十二元到十六元，平均以十四元计算，可得二百一十元，但一百斤蚕茧价格，只值九十元左右）。倒蚕卖桑，自留剥棉，所造成的损失是何等重大！这是不切合实际的价格政策所造成的后果。浙江桑园每亩产桑最高为三十担，最低仅一至二担，平均也不到五担。如果以三十担的产量来说，茧价还可以相应调低；但以每亩平均产量四百五十九斤来说，茧价必须适当提高，以刺激生产鼓励蚕农积极性。这些实际情况，主管部门为什么不很好地作一番调查研究呢？我认为，具体情况要作具体分析，蚕茧的收益不能单纯地同种粮食的收益比较，应该同其他经济作物比较，还要同其他日用商品的价格比较，这里还要着重看看七年来浙江省提高茧价与提高蚕茧质量和生丝本身均匀度的提高，得到什么变化？值得比一比，茧价一九五六年比一九五○年提高百分之二十一，茧质提高，降低缫折百分之二十四点三，提高生丝均匀度百分之十一（这些变化当然由于党的正确领导，提高了科学技术水平，改善企业管理，发挥劳动生产积极性有它的因素在内），但对提高茧质，降低生丝成本的关键也不能轻易忽视的，并且要结合各该地区的实际情况，反复研究，慎重订定收购价格。如果不这样做，便会脱离实际，便是主观主义，便会造成对国家、对人民的严重损失。我们认为应该吸取教训，纠正偏见。
    三、今后意见
    建议中央帮助解决五个问题，并请中央规定浙江蚕桑生产的任务：
    1．要求中央明确地安排浙江蚕丝生产应有的地位。
    2．为了大力发展蚕丝生产事业，要求中央：核减浙江省粮食任务一亿四千万斤，即严禁在约一百四十万亩的桑园种间作物；并在杭、嘉、湖蚕桑经济作物重点区合理供应蚕农的口粮。
    3．每年保证供应蚕桑专用化学肥料一万一千五百吨（一九五六年规定有七千吨）。
    4．在桑园单位面积产量没有均衡提高之前，要求根据实际情况，合理调整茧价，以鼓励蚕农栽桑、养蚕的生产积极性。
    5．要求将浙江蚕茧改进费全部拨归浙江使用，作为充实科学研究，并培养蚕桑丝绸技术人员之用。
    明确浙江的蚕桑生产必须在一九六二年以前为完成一百二十万市担鲜茧的生产任务而努力！
    工商业者改造中的若干问题
    其次，再谈谈有关工商业者改造中存在的若干问题。
    八年多来，由于党和毛主席对工商业者的关怀和教育，由于和平改造政策的正确，使我们已经在社会主义改造的途程上走完了具有决定性意义的第一步，目前正在继续向劳动者过渡的方向迈进，但在前进的道路上，还存在着若干问题。为了社会主义的改造，为了社会主义的建设，我提出如下四个问题，建议政府加以考虑，研究解决。
    第一，关于私方实职人员生老病死、退休、退职的生活福利照顾问题。这是一个复杂的问题，但毕竟是一个迫切需要解决的问题，因为这是有关广大中、小工商业者的切身利益，而问题的存在，足以影响私方人员的积极性和创造性。举例来说，某些女工商业者由于产假没有明文规定，请假须扣除工资（有的企业按百分之五十发给），她们为了生活，不得不于产后几天就做工，影响了身体的健康。又如病假工资，前一时期为了工龄问题，反映意见很多，最近国务院规定不以工龄计算，而规定发百分之五十至百分之七十，但在具体执行中仍难于划分杠子。有的人因工伤事故不能工作，也得扣除工资，他们反映积极工作得不到合理照顾，如杭州重工业泰新祥记电焊厂有个私方叫李时年，工作很积极，后因工作轧伤了手，不能享受医疗待遇，请假期间还扣了工资，从此工作不肯积极。类似情况决非少数。因此有的人患病后为了怕扣工资，带病上班，敷衍了事，于公于私都是不利。去年陈云副总理在一届三次会议上发言中指出：
  “企业核定资产虽然超过了二千元而有困难的私方人员，本人的疾病医疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，也可以参照本企业职工的待遇办理”，可是在具体执行中，根据反映，执行得太刻板，真正困难的得不到解决。又如死亡后的善后问题，由于没有明文规定，致陷某些人的家属生活于困难。像杭州市新华颜料店一个私方甘珊仁病故之后，每月定息不到四元，一家五口的生活处于困难的境地。又如某些合营企业机构臃肿，人浮于事，年老体弱的私方人员原可照章办事，退休、退职，但没有具体办法使老有所养，就很难动员，而对这些年老体弱的人来说，“力疾从公”，于公于私，也没有好处。因此，为精简机构，整编人事带来了一定的障碍，对发展生产，增加积累也受到了一定的损失。或者有人认为目前有些地区已举办了生活互助金，遇有生老病死等等问题，可在互助金中解决，但这仅是治标的办法，何况各地举办生活互助金还不够普遍。根本的办法，就需要研究一套规章，俾使广大的中、小工商业者的生活有所依靠。与这一问题密切关连的是私方人员的工龄问题，因为若干生活福利措施，特别是退休、退职或死亡，就会牵涉到这一问题。我认为私方人员的工龄可以从一九四九年中华人民共和国成立之日起算。因为：解放之后，工商业者在政治上接受了工人阶级的领导，拥护共同纲领和宪法，反对帝国主义，参加各项爱国运动；在经济上接受人民政府的管理和国营经济的领导，先后走上了各种不同形式的国家资本主义的道路。几年来，对供应产品和城乡交流、交纳税款、培养人材等等方面，都起了一定的作用，这些作用，是有利于社会主义建设事业的。既有利于社会主义建设事业，实际上也就是为社会主义服务（当然也为我们自己接受改造创造必要条件）。如果这一说法没有错误的话，那末一般从建国之日起算工龄（其中不同的情况，还得作出不同的具体规定），比较符合事实，也符合赎买政策的原则，因此我认为对工龄问题作出合理的规定，既可以消除私方人员不少顾虑，也有利于调动一切可以调动的积极因素。
    第二，关于中小工商业者私方人员摘帽子的问题。根据杭州市调查，清产核资户除八个大厂不计在内，股东人数为六千七百七十五人（包括不在职股东），其中资金在二千元以下的，共五千零二十七人，占总人数百分之七十四，平均每人资金为四百七十九元，每人每年定息收入平均不到二十四元，每月不过二元。这二元钱的收入，就意义上来说，已经失去了“不无小补”的作用。他们目前生活的主要来源，是依靠工资收入，他们急于要求摘掉帽子的心理是可以理解的。我们遵照毛主席的指示：“中小摘帽子，不要登报，不要搞高潮”；但是，广大的中、小工商业者对放弃定息，摘掉帽子的要求，正如大旱之望云霓。在这一问题上，我们负责工商联工作的感到处理十分困难。处理，没有规章，无所依据；不处理，群情迫切，难以说服。为了更有利于改造，有利为社会主义服务，因此，愿向政府郑重提出建议：凡在工作上有积极表现，并在思想上有显著进步的私方人员，请政府提前考虑他们摘帽子的问题，作出明确的决定，以符合他们梦寐以求的愿望，从而发挥他们的积极作用。
    再就企业核定资产在二千元以上到一万元的工商业者来说，他们内中有部分人也想摘掉帽子。根据杭州市的调查，这一类型的工商业者共一千三百七十五人，占清产核资户总人数六千七百七十五人的百分之二十点三（如加上清产核资在二千元以下的私方人数，则占核资户总人数的百分之九十四点三），每人平均资产为四千四百七十元，平均每人每年的定息收入为二百二十三元，以每月计算，平均不到二十元，这部分人当中也有为数不少的人想放弃定息，摘掉帽子。这一问题，我也建议政府加以研究。
    第三，关于资方代理人和家庭工的名称问题。自从全行业实行公私合营以后，企业性质已根本上起了变化，资本家已成为国家的公职人员了，而资方代理人和家庭工的名称却仍然存在。以资方代理人来说，名义未变，但已无资可代，他们的收入完全依靠工资，而这部分人员大多数具有生产技术和管理能力，再以家庭工来说，过去多数是一方面搞家务，另方面协助搞些企业工作。高潮后经过经济改组，都已经专职在搞企业工作。由上述可见，资方代理人和家庭工根据实际情况，已是名存实亡。既然是徒有“虚名”，不如取消这一名称。更符合于实际，且可发挥积极作用。我还认为：他们之中，思想觉悟比较高的人，建议工会可否加以吸收（即使在与私方人员同一厂店内工作），这是有利于社会主义建设事业的。
    第四，关于小业主多劳多得的问题。政府在去年对小业主统筹安排，在货源、资金、税务等各方面均得到了适当的照顾以后，除少数的还有一些困难之外，一般的来讲，都已经普遍好转，由亏损变为盈余。但是由于对多劳多得的方针，没有明确的规定，因此有的小业主仍然是按照过去的工资支付（小业主的工资一般是比较低的），对于盈余作为企业的积累；而有些小业主却认为既是多劳多得，略有盈余，就任意挥霍。由此引起了不良的政治影响，认为老实的吃亏，调皮的便宜。我认为，为了鼓励积极经营，按劳付酬，多劳多得的原则是应该贯彻的。因此，建议可否参照过去四马分肥办法的精神作出具体的规定，利润如何分配，请政府根据实际情况研究决定。这样一方面可以增加税收，另方面可以鼓舞小业主的经营积极性，而使消极经营的可以受到教育，这是有利于对小商贩的改造的。
    以上四个问题，我认为都有关工商业者的进一步改造问题，也涉及到方针政策。为了社会主义，我不甘缄默，提供政府参考。
