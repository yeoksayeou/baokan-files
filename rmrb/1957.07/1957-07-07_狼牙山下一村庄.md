    Loushan is a village in the mountainous area of Yi County in western Hebei Province, backed by Langya Mountain, a branch of the Taihang Mountains.碧绿的泉水 flows through the center of the street and into the Nanyi River. Various fruit trees are densely planted around the village. Beiloushan, with more than a hundred households, is located at the foot of this beautiful Langya Mountain.
    As far back as the Anti-Japanese War, Loushan was the village where the First Military Sub-district Command of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region was stationed. The Eighth Route Army and guerrillas here gave the invading Japanese aggressors severe blows dozens or hundreds of times. The villages in the Langya Mountain area were also subjected to countless times of destruction, burning, and killing by Japanese bandits. All more than a thousand houses in Beiloushan village were burned down by the enemy continuously, and more than sixty people were killed. However, this village, which was devastated by the enemy, gradually returned to normal with the victory of the war. After land reform and agricultural collectivization, the people's lives here have undergone fundamental changes. In just a few years, Beiloushan village has built more than eight hundred houses; the various fruit trees that were destroyed by the enemy have also been cultivated. There are more than 1,600 persimmon trees alone, and it is estimated that more than 200,000 catties of persimmons can be picked this year, accounting for 50% of the agricultural cooperative's total annual income. With the development of the agricultural cooperative, the income of the members is also increasing year by year. (Attached pictures)

    狼牙山下一村庄
    本报记者  刘长忠摄影
    楼山，是河北省西部易县山区的一个村庄，背后紧靠太行山的一个支脉狼牙山。碧绿的泉水从街心穿过，流向南易水河。这里有各种果树密布在村子的四周。拥有百多户的北楼山就处在这风景优美的狼牙山麓之下。
    楼山，远在抗日战争时期是晋察冀边区第一军分区司令机关常驻的村庄。在这儿的八路军和游击队曾几十次、几百次给进攻边区的日本侵略者严重的打击。狼牙山一带的村庄也遭到过日本强盗无数次的破坏和烧杀。北楼山全村一千多间房，连续被敌人烧光，六十多人被杀害。但，这个惨遭敌人摧残的村庄，随着战争的胜利逐渐恢复了正常。经过土地改革和农业合作化，这里的人民生活起了根本变化。北楼山这个村庄在短短的几年中，建筑了八百多间房屋；曾遭敌人毁坏的各种果树也都培植起来了，光柿子树就有一千六百多棵，今年预计能摘下二十多万斤柿子，要占农业社的全年总收入的50％。随着农业社的发展，社员们的收入也逐年在增加着。（附图片）

    这里，确是个山明水秀的地方。
