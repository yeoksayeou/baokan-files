Smash Zhang Naiqi's New Offensive
Feng Hefa

Rightist Zhang Naiqi, after more than a month of criticism and assistance from various quarters, not only shows no remorse but even dares to launch a new offensive against the Party and the people at the National People's Congress under the guise of "My Self-Criticism." Zhang Naiqi has not disappointed the Taiwan reactionary newspapers' expectation that he would "respond calmly," but the people of the whole country are truly unable to tolerate his extremely reactionary words and deeds any longer.

Let us dissect his so-called "My Self-Criticism" to see how Zhang Naiqi is continuing his offensive.

Cosmetic Enhancements Cannot Conceal the Truth

In his so-called "Self-Criticism," Zhang Naiqi has used every rogue trick, not mentioning a word about the ironclad facts revealed by others, and even shamelessly dressing himself up as a virtuous gentleman.

He believes that his errors are merely "bourgeois individualistic thoughts and style," but even this "self-criticism" is false. He is not criticizing his individualism, but praising it for enabling him to "escape the mire and embark on revolution." If bourgeois individualism can make someone "embark on revolution," that is either a pipe dream or depends on the nature of the revolution. If Zhang Naiqi's "revolution" refers to overthrowing the Communist Party or the socialist system, then it makes sense. But he says: "How can one imagine that a person who refused to express anti-communism in the dark era, under the enemies' various threats and inducements, would now oppose the Party? How can one imagine that a person who pursued socialism in the mire of capitalism would now oppose socialism when the socialist cause has achieved such brilliant victories?" Regardless of whether yesterday's revolutionaries will inevitably become counter-revolutionaries today and tomorrow, the question is, is Zhang Naiqi, who dresses himself up so flamboyantly, really as beautiful as a peach blossom and as cold as ice as he claims? Unfortunately, the exposures of his ugly history are already voluminous, yet he is still lying through his teeth.

Zhang Naiqi, why don't you answer the questions that everyone has revealed about you? For example: When you were imprisoned in the "Seven Gentlemen" case, you asked someone to call Comrade Hu Ziying to hide your secret telegram book in collusion with Guangxi warlords Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Is this a fact? After you were released from prison, to curry favor with Chiang Kai-shek, you advocated "more suggestions, less calls" to oppose the Communist Party's call for the people to resist Japan. Is this a fact? During the War of Resistance, you not only became the Finance Director of the Guangxi faction in Anhui, but also colluded with Chen Cheng and became a leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League. Is this a fact? You colluded with the Shanghai Bank and blackmailed them for a huge sum to become the boss of your so-called "emerging industrialist" representing the national bourgeoisie—Shangchuan Industrial Company and Shangchuan Enterprise Company. Is this a fact? In the early days of organizing the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) in Chongqing, you proposed the middle road to please the Kuomintang. Is this a fact? After liberation, you still insisted that the CDNCA is a bourgeois political party that should serve the capitalists. Is this a fact? ... Which of these series of ugly histories are befitting of someone who claims to be "loyal to the Party and loyal to socialism?" You say that before liberation, "three kinds of threats often entangled me." But apart from the Kuomintang wrongly arresting you and making you one of the "Seven Gentlemen," after which you used this as a political capital to swindle and deceive, what political threats did you suffer before liberation? Before liberation, apart from being a big boss and living a licentious and shameless life, what economic threats did you face? Similarly, before liberation, who dared to touch a big shot like you, who was both an official and a businessman, and was adept at pleasing all sides? What social threats did you have?

Zhang Naiqi said: "Many people who have been close to me can prove that I have always been a revolutionary optimist." In his view, "bourgeois individualists" are "revolutionary optimists." This is not surprising, because the "revolution" he refers to is essentially a reactionary activity against the Party and against socialism. Here, bourgeois individualists can naturally be called "revolutionary optimists." Therefore, he tries every means to promote the "initiative" of industrialists and businessmen, which is to restore capitalism in China; Li Kangnian's bourgeois idea of fixed interest for twenty years, with both fame and fortune, is seen by him as a kind of "overly hasty pursuit of socialism." Didn't he also say a few days ago in the NPC group meeting that he was a "leftist" and should be allowed to play an "active" role in the anti-rightist struggle? Zhang Naiqi is very much like Shen Gongbao in "Investiture of the Gods," with his face turned to the back. Although we stand with him, he only sees the back, while we see the front. "People who have been close to him can prove" that Zhang Naiqi's so-called "initiative" is a reactionary activity against the Party and against socialism. We and Zhang Naiqi stand on two different positions, and our struggle with him is a struggle between two roads.

Still Continuing to Release Poison

If Zhang Naiqi's "Self-Criticism" does not have some flavor of "self-criticism," it is because of a misunderstanding of his habitually used vocabulary. In his articles, doesn't much of what he calls "socialism" actually mean capitalism? His consistent opposition to the Party and socialism, doesn't it become "loyalty to the Party" and "loyalty to socialism" in his articles? Then, his "self-criticism" should not be interpreted according to our general understanding of these two words. When he spoke on his main fallacies in the group meeting, the newspapers said, "Zhang Naiqi began to admit his mistakes." This is a bit of an "injustice" to him. How could Zhang Naiqi, who claims that "real gold is not afraid of fire," easily admit his mistakes without continuing to "respond calmly?"

In his "My Self-Criticism," there is no place where he admits his mistakes. On the contrary, he not only continues to debate his reactionary fallacies but also further releases a large amount of poison. Let us see how he "examined, corrected, and clarified" the following points:

1. On the issue of fixed interest. He believes that his statement that fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income "is derived from the fact that someone in the past has affirmed that the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie is no longer an antagonistic contradiction." We heard about the non-antagonistic nature of the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in the communication of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. Who is the "someone" that Zhang Naiqi is referring to here? His intention is nothing more than to say that his statement that fixed interest is not exploitation is derived from Chairman Mao's words about non-antagonistic contradictions, so if there is an error, the responsibility does not lie with him, Zhang Naiqi. This insidiously malicious tactic is already vicious enough. What is even more abominable is that he then said that Chairman Mao pointed out in his published speech that there is both an antagonistic and a non-antagonistic side to the contradictions among the people between the exploited and the exploiters, and he used this to distort Chairman Mao's instructions once again, hinting to others that Chairman Mao's statements were different before and after.

2. On the issue of the essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. Here, he insists that "the general explanation for 'essential difference' should be that there is an essential difference between exploitation and non-exploitation, and anti-exploitation." Chairman Mao clearly said "exploited and exploiting," but he still does not admit that the working class is exploited. As we understand it, before classes are finally eliminated, the working class and the bourgeoisie will always be in a relationship of being exploited and exploiting. In his so-called "Self-Criticism," Zhang Naiqi only further affirmed his reactionary fallacy on this issue and showed no signs of "examining, correcting, and clarifying" anything.

3. On the issue of bureaucraticism being a more dangerous enemy than capitalism. Zhang Naiqi not only lightly brushed off responsibility by saying "I did not say that socialism inevitably leads to bureaucraticism," but also blamed others, saying, "Some rightists have already equated socialism with bureaucraticism and even the 'three evils'." Isn't Zhang Naiqi the leader of "some rightists?" Isn't it Zhang Naiqi himself who equated them? He said: "My statement is easily confused with their statement. I should negate my statement." Originally, there was nothing wrong with Zhang Naiqi's statement, it was just "easily confused with their statement," so he "negated" his statement. In fact, why bother! Doesn't Zhang Naiqi welcome all rightists to support (that is, what he calls "confusing") his statement? Isn't he the commander of these rightists? How can the commander "separate himself from the masses?"

4. On the issue of the national bourgeoisie no longer having two sides. He lightly dismissed this with "I did not say that." However, the evidence is there, and the black characters on white paper cannot be erased. He had to come up with a "continued examination and correction" in order to continue to quibble.

5. On the issue of industrialists and businessmen being able to love socialism without transformation. He also says "This is not what I said," how "relaxed and happy." Look: "'Industrialists and businessmen can be patriotic, but they will never love socialism.' This dogmatic statement is completely unfounded." How straightforward he is! Naturally, his technique is "clever," ambushing everywhere, and he can always quibble. If it wasn't you who said it, why did you stand up to argue when the State Council discussed Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report?"

Look, what "admissions of mistakes" and "self-criticisms" does Zhang Naiqi have regarding his reactionary fallacies? In continuing to defend his fallacies, he never forgets to release poison, stirring up the feelings and unity of industrialists and businessmen towards the Party and the government. He said: "I strongly advocate shortening the distance between people among the people to facilitate unity and work." In other words, everyone who criticizes him, those whom he considers "dogmatic bureaucrats," are expanding the distance between people, which is not conducive to unity and work. He said: "I have an overly optimistic estimate of the socialist transformation of national bourgeois elements, and I one-sidedly emphasize the positive aspects of raising their enthusiasm." In other words, others are "overly pessimistic" about the socialist transformation of the national bourgeoisie and one-sidedly emphasize their negative aspects. In this so-called "self-criticism," phrases that scold "dogmatists" are rarely seen, but some of his tricks are already familiar to everyone and cannot deceive people.

Reactionary Words and Deeds are Futile Attempts at Concealment

Everyone has determined that Zhang Naiqi is one of the leaders of the anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists, and a nationwide denunciation of him has been launched. It is impossible for him to remain "relaxed, happy, and at ease" all the time. Therefore, in addition to repeatedly dressing himself up as a "revolutionary" and using nonsense such as "I often work and study for more than ten hours a day for the sake of socialism" to "make an ugly show of merit," he also flatly "cries injustice." He said: "A person who has serious bourgeois individualism must be a rightist on the ideological front. But after deep examination, I have nothing in common with those rightists who are politically anti-Party and anti-socialist." He clearly denies that he is politically anti-Party and anti-socialist, and he is also evasive about whether he is a "rightist" on the "ideological front."

Well, let's look at the six points that Zhang Naiqi himself put forward to see whether he is lying through his teeth or whether others have "distorted" him.

First, he regards bureaucraticism as an enemy more terrible than capitalism. He slanders socialist enterprises, believing that socialism plus bureaucraticism makes the efficiency of enterprises inferior to capitalism. He repeatedly exaggerates the superiority of capitalism, saying that capitalists are "good at employing people" and have a "sense of enterprise." Isn't this slandering socialism as a mess? He exaggerates the individual shortcomings of our socialist cause to be worse than a class antagonistic society where people eat people, and still says that he "did not exaggerate the shortcomings of the country's work and obliterate the achievements of the country's work."

Second, among the rightists, his division of labor is not in the student area, but in the industrial and commercial circles. He doesn't inquire about whether students may cause trouble, doesn't he hope that industrialists and businessmen will cause trouble? He believes that the state does not treat industrialists and businessmen with equal personality, and the "dogmatic bureaucrats" have attacked the "enthusiasm" of industrialists and businessmen. The two-sidedness is political counter-revolution and economic "five poisons," etc. Isn't the purpose to stir up the dissatisfaction of industrialists and businessmen, hoping that they will cause trouble?

Third, he went to Hebei, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, and set fires everywhere. There have been many exposures in the newspapers, aren't they all facts? He went to Qingtian for inspection, stirring up farmers' dissatisfaction with unified purchase and sales. What is the difference between the Minister of Grain hoping that the grain problem would go wrong, and another rightist Zeng Zhaolun, who, as Deputy Minister of Education, feared that education work would not be chaotic? How can he still have the face to say that he "never stirs up trouble or sets fires everywhere?"

Fourth, he maliciously distorts Stalin's remarks on the qualities of Party members, not only turning the phrase that Party members are "made of special materials" into the ideological foundation of "walls" and "ditches," but also saying: "The Chinese Communist Party's education of Party members has nothing in common with the above sentence." According to him, Soviet Communist Party members and Chinese Communist Party members have nothing in common in terms of Party spirit. He said: "Chairman Mao's teachings to Party members are to be modest and prudent, and to oppose arrogance and complacency." There is nothing wrong with this sentence in itself, but by comparing this sentence with the Soviet Union, doesn't it imply that Soviet Communist Party members are not like this? Isn't it still stirring up the relationship between our Party and the Soviet Union? He said that he "did not violate the spirit of 'leaning to one side' in the slightest," but he praised capitalism so much and longed for the "superiority" of capitalist enterprises, can he still be said to be "leaning to one side" towards socialism?

Fifth, recently many of his "small organizations" have been exposed in the CDNCA. Since the rectification campaign, he has supported Huang Miaofu in Shanghai and encouraged Wu Jincui in Beijing, asking them to attack wildly. Isn't this a fact? He "labors day and night," can it still be said that it is to "be worthy of the Party and the country" instead of opposing the Party and the country?

Sixth, he fundamentally denies the difference in class essence, thereby negating the leadership of the working class; he compares the Communist Party members to political swindlers in the play "Looking West to Chang'an"; he implies that the Party "monopolizes" revolutionary theory, and refers to all correct Marxist-Leninist theories as "dogmatism"; he slanders the United Front Work Department for being biased and credulous, "drawing circles," and "participating in factional activities"; he joins in the chorus with Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World," slandering the Party for having "great-Party-ism," and the "situation may be very serious." He even dares to say that his criticism has not gone beyond the scope of criticizing the "three evils," "and absolutely has not involved the whole Party and the Party Central Committee!"

Zhang Naiqi is a consistently anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist. Since his reactionary words and deeds have been exposed and criticized by various parties, he has tried every means to reduce his reactionary activities to the scope of ideological problems or understanding problems. Now, he once again covers his ears and steals the bell, saying: "I have always believed that my problem is only an ideological problem; my mistake is only a theoretical error." The people of the whole country will never be deceived by Zhang Naiqi. The struggle against the rightists is an ideological struggle and also a serious political struggle, and it is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Since the rightist Zhang Naiqi has stepped onto the stage to challenge the Party and the people, he will naturally be countered by the people of the whole country. Now, he is trying to retreat to the ideological and theoretical problems, which is just like an ostrich burying its head in the sand.

Willing to Isolate Himself from the People

Zhang Naiqi ignores all the facts revealed by others, and lightly dismisses others' criticisms of him with the word "distortion." At the Sichuan group meeting of the NPC, he openly said that the joint instructions of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce were a "distortion" of his words. Now, he dares to continue to launch an offensive and spread his anti-Party and anti-socialist poison under the guise of "self-criticism" at the NPC plenary meeting.

In his so-called "My Self-Criticism," he not only washes himself clean and releases poison while washing himself, but also in the concluding part of his "self-criticism," he is extremely sinister and releases another poisonous arrow. He slanders those who criticize him for using the strategy of "many voices can melt metal" and "Zeng Shen killing people." He wrote in great detail in a letter he gave to the Communist Youth League of the Grain Ministry on July 10: "In the democratic parties, there are some experts in creating rumors. They have gained 'wisdom' from the story of 'Zeng Shen killing people,' believing that even a loving mother cannot withstand the same rumor three times and will waver, then the leaders' attitude towards cadres and the masses' attitude towards individuals will certainly not withstand the same rumor several times. Therefore, they have organized and released the same rumors from all sides to deceive the leaders and the masses." He slandered the people of the whole country who opposed him, scolding everyone as experts in creating rumors; he also slandered the leaders, believing that they are credulous of "rumors." Zhang Naiqi, do you still have any human heart?

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out: "We hope that through the impetus of external forces, the experience of life, and their own awakening, the rightists can repent and accept transformation. The door of socialist transformation is open to them." Now, the rightist Zhang Naiqi not only does not accept others' patient help, but insists on a reactionary stance, and even dares to continue to attack the Party and the people under the guise of "self-criticism." This shows that Zhang Naiqi has gone further and further and is willing to isolate himself from the people. In order to distinguish between right and wrong and to make industrialists and businessmen across the country more clearly aware of the serious harm of his anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary activities, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against him and thoroughly smash all his reactionary conspiracies.

    打碎章乃器的新攻势
    冯和法
    右派分子章乃器经过一个多月来各方面对他的批判，帮助，不但毫无悔悟，而且居然在全国人民代表大会上，以“我的检讨”为幌子，对党、对人民发动了新攻势。章乃器算是没有辜负台湾反动报纸称许他“沉着应战”的期望，但全国人民对他这种反动透顶的言行，实在已经忍无可忍了。
    我们来把他的所谓“我的检讨”解剖一下，看看章乃器还在怎样继续他的攻势。
    擦脂抹粉是掩盖不了的
    章乃器在他的这篇所谓“检讨”中耍尽了无赖手法，他对别人揭发他的铁一样的事实，一字不提，而还敢厚颜无耻地把他自己打扮成一个正人君子。
    他认为他的错误只是“资产阶级的个人主义的思想和作风”，但是，仅仅这一些
  “检讨”也是假的。他不是批评他的个人主义，而是赞美他的个人主义使他能够“脱离泥坑，走上革命”。资产阶级的个人主义能够使人“走上革命”，如果不是一句梦话，那就要看是一种什么性质的革命了。如果章乃器指的“革命”，是要革共产党的命，革社会主义的命，那是说得过去的。但是，他说：“那能设想，一个在黑暗时代，在敌人千方百计的威逼利诱之下，都不肯表示反共的人，今天反而要反党？那能设想，一个在资本主义的泥坑里就追求社会主义的人，在今天社会主义事业已经取得如此辉煌胜利的时候，反而要反社会主义？”姑不论昨天的革命者是否今天和明天就必然不会成为反革命，问题是，章乃器把自己打扮得这样花枝招展，是不是真如他所自许的这样一个艳如桃李，冷如冰霜的人呢？可惜的是，各方面揭发他的丑史已经盈篇累牍，而他还在睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    章乃器，你为什么不回答大家对你所揭发的问题？例如：你在以“七君子”案件入狱时，叫人打电话给胡子婴同志给你掩藏你勾结广西军阀李宗仁、白崇禧的密电本，这是不是事实？你出狱后，为向蒋介石献媚，主张“多建议，少号召”，来反对共产党对人民的抗日号召，这是不是事实？抗战时期你不仅当上了桂系的安徽财政厅长，而且又勾结陈诚，当上了三青团的头子，这是不是事实？你勾结上海银行，又要挟上海银行，勒索一笔巨款，来做你的所谓代表民族资产阶级的“新兴工业家”——上川实业公司、上川企业公司的老板，这是不是事实？在重庆组织民主建国会的初期，你就提出中间路线，来取媚国民党，这是不是事实？解放以后，你还是主张民建会是一个资产阶级政党，要为资本家服务，这是不是事实？……这一系列的丑史，有那些是自命“忠于党、忠于社会主义”的人所应有的呢？你说，在解放前，有“三种威胁经常纠缠着我”。但是除了国民党错捕了你，使你成为“七君子”之一，以后你就以此招摇撞骗，作为政治资本外，在解放前你受到过什么政治威胁？在解放前，你除了当大老板，过着荒淫无耻的生活外，有过什么经济威胁？同样，在解放前，像你这样亦官亦商，八面玲珑的大人物，谁敢来碰你，你有过什么社会威胁？
    章乃器说：“许多同我接近过的人都可以证明，我经常是一个革命乐观主义者”。在他看来，“资产阶级的个人主义者”就是“革命乐观主义者”。这是并没有什么奇怪的，因为他所指的“革命”实质上是反党反社会主义的反动活动，在这里，资产阶级的个人主义者自然可以称为“革命乐观主义者”。所以，他千方百计地要发挥工商业者的“积极性”，就是要资本主义在中国复辟；李康年的定息二十年的名利双收的资产阶级思想，在他看来自然是一种“过急地追求社会主义”。他前几天在人代小组会上不是还说他是“左派”，还应该让他来发挥反右派斗争的“积极性”吗？章乃器很像“封神演义”上的申公豹，脸向背后，我们和他虽然站在一起，他看到的只是后面，而我们所看到的是前面。同他“接近过的人都可证明”，章乃器的所谓“积极性”，就是反党反社会主义的反动活动。我们同章乃器是站在两个不同的立场，我们同他的斗争是两条道路的斗争。
    至今还继续施放毒素
    如果说，章乃器的“自我检讨”没有一些“检讨”的味道，那就是不理解他的惯用字汇的原故。在他的文章中，许多“社会主义”在实质上难道不就是资本主义吗？他一贯地反党反社会主义，在他的文章中不是成为“忠于党”和“忠于社会主义”了吗？那末，他的“检讨”本来就不应依照我们对这两个字的一般理解去解释的。他在小组会上对他的几个主要谬论发了言，报上说：“章乃器开始认错”，这未免“委屈”了他，自命“真金不怕火”的章乃器怎肯不继续“沉着应战”而就轻易认错呢？
    在他的“我的检讨”中丝毫没有认错的地方，相反的，他不仅继续对他的反动谬论进行辩论，而且还进一步施放了大量的毒素。看他是怎样“检查纠正和澄清”以下几个论点的：
    一、关于定息问题。他认为他说定息不是剥削而是不劳而获，“是根据过去已经有人肯定：工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾，已经是非对抗性的矛盾，而引伸出来的”。工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾已经是非对抗性矛盾，我们是在听毛主席在最高国务会议上所作讲演的传达中听到的。章乃器这里所谓“有人”是指谁？他的用意无非是，他所以说定息不是剥削，是根据毛主席关于非对抗性矛盾的话引伸出来的，所以，如果错误，责任不在他章乃器。这种含沙射影的手法已经够恶毒了。更可恶的是他下面说到毛主席在发表出来的讲演中，指出人民内部矛盾在被剥削者和剥削者之间除了对抗性的一面还有非对抗性一面时，他借此又一度歪曲毛主席的指示，暗示别人说，毛主席的前后说法不同了。
    二、关于资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子本质区别问题。他在这里坚持说：“一般对于‘本质不同’的解释，应该是剥削同不剥削、反剥削有本质的区别”。毛主席明明是说“被剥削与剥削”，而他还是不承认工人阶级是被剥削的。据我们理解，在阶级没有最后消灭以前，工人阶级和资产阶级始终是被剥削与剥削的关系。章乃器在所谓“检讨”中对这个问题只是对他的反动谬论作了进一步的肯定，丝毫看不出有什么“检查纠正和澄清”的地方。
    三、关于官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人问题。章乃器对此不仅轻轻地以“我并没有说，社会主义必然带来官僚主义”，来推诿责任，而且嫁祸于人，说：“某些右派分子已经把社会主义与官僚主义甚至‘三害’之间画上了等号”。难道章乃器不是“某些右派分子”的头儿吗？画上等号的难道不就是章乃器自己吗？他说：
  “我的说法容易同他们的说法混淆起来。我应该否定我的说法”。原来章乃器的说法并没有错，只是“容易同他们的说法混淆起来”，所以“否定”了他的说法。实际上，这又何苦来！难道章乃器不欢迎所有右派分子拥护（也就他所说“混淆”）他的说法，他不正是这些右派分子的大帅吗？大帅怎好“脱离群众”呢？
    四、关于民族资产阶级已经没有两面性问题。他对此轻轻以“我没有这样说”推脱了事。但是，赃证俱在，白纸上黑字是抹不掉的，他不得不来个当“继续检查改正”，以图继续狡辩。
    五、关于工商业者不经过改造就可以爱社会主义问题。他对此又是一个“这不是我说的”，推得多么“轻松愉快”。请看：“‘工商业家可以爱国，但绝不会爱社会主义’，这种教条主义的说法，是完全没有根据的”。他是说得多么直截了当！自然，他的手法是“高明”的，到处打埋伏，随时可以狡赖。既不是你说的，为什么在国务会议上讨论周总理的“政府工作报告”时你要起来辩解呢？
    请看，章乃器对于他的反动谬论有那些“认错”和“检讨”？他在为他的谬论继续辩护中，始终不忘施放毒素，挑拨工商业者对党和政府的感情和团结。他说：“我极力主张缩短人民内部人与人之间的距离，以利于团结和工作”，换句话说，一切批判他的人，他认为是“教条主义者官僚们”的人，就是在扩大人与人之间的距离，不利于团结和工作。他说：“我对于民族资产阶级分子社会主义改造的过分乐观的估计，片面强调提高他们的积极性一面”，换句话说，别人就是对民族资产阶级的社会主义改造“过分悲观”，和片面强调他们的消极一面了。在这篇所谓“检讨”中，大骂“教条主义者”一类的字句是少见了，但是，他的一些遮眼法是大家早已熟悉，怎么也骗不过人的。
    反动言行欲盖弥彰
    大家认定章乃器是反党反社会主义的右派分子头子之一，已在全国范围掀起了对他的声讨。对此，他是不可能始终“轻松愉快，心安理得”的，于是，除了一再把自己扮成“革命者”，用“我每天工作和学习的时间，往往超过十小时，为的就是社会主义”一类废话来作“丑表功”外，就是矢口“呼冤”。他说：“一个犯有严重的资产阶级个人主义的人，他（为什么不用“我”字？——引者）在思想战线上肯定是属于右派的。但我经深刻检查，我同那些在政治上反党、反社会主义的右派分子，是没有任何共同之点的。”他明确地否认了自己在政治上反党反社会主义，在“思想战线”是否“右派”，他也是闪烁其辞的。
    好吧，就按照章乃器自己所提出的六点来看，究竟是他在睁着眼睛说瞎话，还是别人“歪曲”了他。
    第一，他把官僚主义视作比资本主义还可怕的敌人，他毁谤社会主义企业，认为社会主义加上官僚主义，企业的效率比资本主义不如。他一再夸大资本主义的优越，资本家“善于用人”、有“事业心”，反过来不是毁谤社会主义一团糟还是什么？他把我国社会主义事业的个别缺点夸大到比人吃人的阶级对抗社会还不如，还说“没有夸大国家工作的缺点，抹煞国家工作的成绩”。
    第二，在右派分子中，他的分工不在学生方面，而是在工商界方面，他不打听学生可能闹事，难道他就不希望工商业者闹事？他认为国家没有以平等人格对待工商业者，“教条主义的官僚们”打击了工商业者的“积极性”，两面性是政治上的反革命和经济上的“五毒”等等说法，目的不是挑拨工商业者的不满，希望他们闹事又是什么？
    第三，他到河北、杭州、上海，到处点火，报上已经有不少的揭发，难道都不是事实吗？他到青田视察，挑拨农民对统购统销的不满，粮食部长希望粮食问题出乱子，和另一右派分子曾昭抡，以教育部副部长身份，惟恐教育工作不乱，又有什么分别？他怎么还有脸说自己“绝不遇事生非，到处点火”？
    第四，他恶意地歪曲斯大林对于党员品质的说法，不仅把党员是由“特殊材料制成的”一句话，说成是“墙”和“沟”的思想基础，而且，还说：“中国共产党对党员的教育同上述句子是毫无共同之处的”。照他的说法，苏联共产党员和中国共产党员作为党性来说，就没有共同之处。他说：“毛主席对党员的教导是谦虚谨慎，反对骄傲自满”，这句话本来没有错，但他把这句话和苏联比较，难道不是暗示苏联共产党员就不是这个样？难道还不是挑拨我们的党和苏联的关系吗？他说他“没有丝毫违背‘一边倒’的精神”，但他是这样的赞美资本主义，向往资本主义的企业“优越性”，还能说他是“一边倒”向社会主义的吗？
    第五，最近在民建会已经揭露了他不少的“小组织”。整风以来，他支持上海的黄苗夫，鼓励北京的吴金萃，要他们猖狂进攻，难道不是事实？他“夜以继日地劳动”，还能说是为了“对得起党和国家”，而不是反对党和国家吗？
    第六，他根本否定阶级本质的区别，从而否定工人阶级的领导；他把共产党员比作“西望长安”剧本中的政治骗子；他暗示党“垄断”革命理论，把一切正确的马克思列宁主义理论一概称为“教条主义”；他毁谤统战部偏听偏信，“划圈子”，“参加宗派活动”；他和储安平的“党天下”谬论合唱，诬蔑党有“大党主义”，而且还是“情况可能是很严重的”。他居然还敢说他的批评没有超出批判“三害”范围，“而绝没有涉及全党和党中央的地方”！
    章乃器是一个一贯地反党反社会主义的右派分子。自从他的反动言行遭到各方面的揭露和批判，他就千方百计地企图把他的反动活动缩小到思想问题或者理解问题的范围之内。现在，他再一次掩耳盗铃地说：“我始终认为：我的问题只是思想的问题；我的错误只是理论上的错误。”全国人民决不会被章乃器所骗的。反右派分子的斗争是一场思想斗争，也是一场严重的政治斗争，这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。右派分子章乃器既然站上台来，向党和人民挑战，自然要遭到全国人民的回击，现在，他企图退缩到思想问题和理论问题上去，只是他自己像驼鸟一样，把头缩到沙中去而已。
    甘心自绝于人民
    章乃器对于别人所揭露的事实一概置之不理，别人批判他的话只以“歪曲”两字轻轻推开。在人代会四川小组会上，他公然说民建会和工商联的联合指示是对他的话的“歪曲”，现在，他竟敢在人代会大会上，假借“检讨”的幌子，继续发动攻势，散播他的反党反社会主义的毒素。
    他在所谓“我的检讨”中不仅把自己洗刷的干干净净，并在洗刷自己的时候肆放毒素，而且在他的“检讨”的结束部分，更是阴险万分，又施放了一支毒箭。他诬蔑批评他的人是利用了“众口可以铄金”、“曾参杀人”的策略，7月10日他给粮食部共青团的一封信中说得非常详细。他写道：“在民主党派中，有些造谣专家。他们从‘曾参杀人’的故事中取得了‘智慧’，以为慈母对于爱子，尚且经不起三次同样的谣言，而发生动摇，那末，领导对于干部，群众对于个人，当然更经不起几次同样的谣言。因此，他们就有组织地、从各方面放出同样的谣言，以蒙蔽领导，欺骗群众”。他诬蔑了全国反对他的人，把大家骂成造谣专家；也诬蔑了领导，认为是轻信“谣言”。章乃器，你究竟是否还有一些人心？
    周恩来总理指出：“我们希望，经由外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够幡然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门是对他们开着的”。现在，右派分子章乃器不仅不接受别人对他的耐心的帮助，坚持反动立场，而且还敢在“检讨”幌子下继续向党和人民进攻，这表明章乃器已经越走越远，不惜自绝于人民。我们为了辨别大是大非，使全国工商业者更清楚地认识他的反党反社会主义的反动活动的严重危害性，就必须对他继续进行坚决的斗争，彻底粉碎他的一切反动阴谋。
