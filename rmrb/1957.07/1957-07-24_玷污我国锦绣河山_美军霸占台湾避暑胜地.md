Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd -- In the hot summer, American troops in Taiwan have seized many summer resorts.

According to Taiwan newspapers, Tamsui Shalun Beach, one of Taiwan's best summer resorts, will be specially opened to American troops from August 1st; most areas are strictly forbidden to residents.

This Tamsui bathing beach, located more than 20 miles west of Taipei, has recently been built with many American-style pavilions, hotels, and theaters, becoming entirely a recreation center for American troops. Taiwanese residents passing through these areas are often beaten by American soldiers, and some kind women are forcibly taken by American soldiers to be "bathing companions."

In the scenic area north of Taipei City, not long ago, the houses of many residents were forcibly demolished to make way for barracks for American officers and soldiers on vacation here. Better hot spring hotels, such as the First Hotel and the Yingbin Hotel, have been occupied by American officers, and even some Kuomintang officials' offices and residences have been taken over by American troops.

    玷污我国锦绣河山
    美军霸占台湾避暑胜地
    新华社23日讯　在炎热的夏天里，美军在台湾霸占了许多避暑胜地。
    据台湾报纸透露，台湾最好的避暑胜地之一淡水沙仑海滨，将从8月1日起特为美军开放；大部分地区严禁居民进去。
    这个位在台北以西二十多里的淡水浴场，最近建筑了许多美式的凉亭、旅馆、戏院，完全成了美军的游乐中心。台湾居民路过这些地区，常常被美军殴打，有些善良的妇女，也被美军强拉去作了“伴浴女郎”。
    在台北市北的风景地区，不久前，许多居民的房屋被迫拆毁，让给到这里休假的美军官兵修建营房。较好的温泉旅馆，如第一宾馆、迎宾馆，都被美国军官侵占，甚至有些国民党官员的办公室和公馆也被美军分居。
