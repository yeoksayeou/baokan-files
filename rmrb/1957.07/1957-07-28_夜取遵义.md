    Taking Zunyi by Night
    Major General Wang Jicheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Railway Corps
    Before dawn on January 3, 1935, I received a phone call from Political Commissar Liu Yalou of the division. He said, "The Fourth Regiment has already broken through the Wujiang River defense line and controlled the ferry. Your Sixth Regiment should immediately cross the river, advance rapidly, and take Zunyi City directly!"
      Hearing that this task was assigned to us, we were overjoyed; we set off in the dark. Although the Wujiang River was rapid and the waves were turbulent, and we felt like we were riding a horse with a broken rein and no saddle, with the risk of being thrown off at any time, we still felt it was running too slow!
    By daybreak, we had all crossed the river and immediately aimed our arrow of advance towards Zunyi. Regiment Commander Zhu Shuiqiu rode his horse, opened his leather backpack that he carried with him all day, took out the 1:50,000 map, spread it on the horse's neck, and walked, looked, and pondered, his body swaying with the horse's galloping pace. I walked alongside him, my eyes fixed on the map, considering the tactics for attacking Zunyi. In those war years, we were very accustomed to this kind of "office work on horseback."
    The result of our research was to determine that the First and Second Battalions would be the assault battalions, breaking in from the east and south sides of Zunyi; the Third Battalion would be the reserve.
    That night, we stayed in Tuanxi Town, ninety miles away from Zunyi.
    The next day (January 4), it was still pitch black when we got up. As soon as we got up, the guard told us that Chief of Staff Liu Bocheng of the headquarters had arrived.
    We were delighted to hear this and said, "We have support now!" Regiment Commander Zhu and I hurriedly washed our faces, he went to gather the troops, and I went to Chief of Staff Liu's place.
    As soon as I crossed the threshold, I saw Chief of Staff Liu washing his face. From our conversation, I learned that he had come overnight from the headquarters. However, on his face, which was thin due to overwork, there was not a trace of fatigue; he was in particularly good spirits.
    He asked me, "Political Commissar Wang, are you confident in taking Zunyi?"
    "We have already studied it and there is no problem; we have learned about Wang Jialie's troops and we will definitely be able to take them down." Then I reported the battle plan to him, he thought for a while and nodded in agreement.
    "In the past three months, we have traveled through four or five provinces, marched thousands of miles, and fought dozens of battles. The soldiers must be very tired, right?" he asked with concern.
    "Tired is tired, but as soon as everyone hears about fighting, their spirits are boosted, and they forget about fatigue."
    He smiled and asked again, "How about the ammunition?"
    "Plenty. The more battles we fight, the more ammunition we have; this time if we use it up, we can replenish it fully after taking Zunyi," I said.
    He nodded thoughtfully, and then said seriously, "Taking Zunyi this time is of great significance! You are the main force, and the battles you have fought along the way have been very beautiful. We require that this shot be even louder! Although Wang Jialie's troops are a local force, Zunyi City is relatively large, and the city defenses are also relatively strict. The enemy has more than three thousand, and we only have one thousand and a few, so there are still difficulties. When fighting a war, you have to treat tofu like a stone and cut it!"
    I listened silently. He slowly and again instructed: "Our days are relatively difficult, we require the battle to be well fought, but also require few casualties, and bullets must be used sparingly, which requires a little more wisdom!"
    I carefully pondered the leader's words, and felt as if he had revealed something to me. I said firmly, "Leader, rest assured, we will do everything possible to take Zunyi! Would you like to say a few words to the troops?"
    "Yes. Today I will also fight to Zunyi with you!" As he said that, he put on his glasses.
    The leader's burden is so heavy, I don't know how many nights he hasn't slept, and he is going to fight with us, how can that be done? I was so excited that I wanted to say something, but I couldn't say it; I felt that with Chief of Staff Liu's personal guidance, our backs would be even straighter.
    I went to the troop assembly point with Chief of Staff Liu, and it was already dawn; thick fog was permeating, as if everyone was emitting gas from their bodies. Chief of Staff Liu stood in the middle of the soldiers, looked around at the soldiers' faces, and then began to speak loudly:
    "Comrades, you are a model unit, you are fast, fierce, hardworking, and enduring. This time, the task of attacking Zunyi is entrusted to you. I believe you will be able to achieve victory and remove this obstacle for our Red Army on the road to the North to resist Japan!..."
    Before Chief of Staff Liu had finished speaking, the soldiers raised their fists and shouted slogans, expressing their determination. That heroic voice was like a hundred cannons firing at the same time, blasting the enemy in Zunyi to pieces.
    We marched briskly towards Zunyi. In the afternoon, the scouts reported: An enemy outpost was discovered thirty miles away from Zunyi, with more than a battalion stationed in the village. At that time, Regiment Commander Zhu gave the order, and our troops, like a pair of pliers, clamped down on the village with lightning speed. Chief of Staff Liu instructed us: We must annihilate all the enemies here, not allowing a single one to escape, otherwise, if the news gets out, it will affect the attack on Zunyi.
    At three o'clock, we started the attack, and it started raining heavily. Everyone was soaked as if they had taken a bath. But this was commonplace for us. It was the enemy who suffered, they were intoxicated by the obstacle of the natural barrier of the Wujiang River, and at the same time believed that the rainy weather was even more peaceful.... When they heard the sound of gunfire erupting, and woke up suddenly from their dreams and panicked to meet the battle, they did not expect that they had already become turtles in a jar.
    Before long, we fought our way into the village. The enemy battalion commander attempted to escape, leading a group of remnants and charging around in the village, but they did not escape our encirclement. We completely fulfilled Chief of Staff Liu's instructions: all the enemies here, except for the dead, were taken prisoner. It was a pity that the enemy battalion commander was too impatient and died one step too early, otherwise, if he had been taken prisoner, we could have learned more about the situation in Zunyi City.
    Zunyi's tentacles were cut off by us, and on the contrary, it became our tentacles. In order to understand the situation in Zunyi in detail, we found a company commander, a platoon leader, and a dozen soldiers from poorer backgrounds from the prisoners and talked to them.
    At first, I asked them their names, hometowns, and family situations one by one. Whoever was asked stood up respectfully, clicked his heels, and answered me tremblingly. The company commander also lost his former prestige, and during the conversation, his fearful gaze never dared to meet mine, and he answered stutteringly.
    Seeing that they were so afraid and suspicious, I first explained our policy on prisoners to them, and explained that our Red Army was a workers' and peasants' army that overthrew warlords and landlords and stood up for the poor. And according to their situation, I also talked about why the poor and the rich were unequal, and why we should overthrow the warlords and landlords. Finally, I asked them: "Think about it, who are you soldiers for?"
    Some words hit them right in the heart, some were wiping their eyes and crying, some were bowing their heads and silent, and some said: "We are ganganren (meaning poor people) with no food to eat, so we became soldiers!" Two people tore off the caps with the Blue Sky White Sun insignia from their heads, threw them on the ground, and stomped on them a few times, angrily saying:
    "We have been deceived, we will no longer sell our lives for the warlords and landlords!"
    Seeing that they were beginning to awaken, I said: "Let me tell you, we are going to attack Zunyi today, whoever knows the situation in Zunyi in detail, tell us, and there will be a reward afterwards."
    The company commander stood up, nodding and bowing, said: "Officer, the Red Army is so good to us, how dare I not serve!" Then he described the fortifications of Zunyi and the strength of the defending enemies one by one, and drew a map.
    "Is it all true?" I asked the company commander, and at the same time asked the soldiers with my eyes.
    The company commander said ingratiatingly: "What I said is all true, if I lie, please kill me on the spot!" The awakened soldiers also nodded to indicate that there were no lies.
    Finally, they were given three silver dollars each. Although our life was very difficult at that time and we had no money, we were still benevolent and righteous to the prisoners. They held the silver dollars and said gratefully: "Our officers said that you are Red Noses, Green Eyes, murderers and arsonists, and if you catch us, you will dig out our eyes and cut our bellies, we were really afraid, but we didn't expect you to be the best people, our saviors!"
    After talking with the prisoners, I thought: Now we have found out the details of the enemy in Zunyi City, and at the same time, none of the enemies here have escaped, why can't we disguise ourselves as enemies and use the prisoners to trick the city, and fight a cheap battle? I discussed it with Regiment Commander Zhu, and he agreed; we reported to Chief of Staff Liu, and he said: "Very good, this is wisdom." And he instructed: "Disguise as enemies must be convincing, you must not let the enemy see through it."
    The main role in this play was played by Company Commander Zeng Baotang of the First Battalion, leading the Third Company, the reconnaissance platoon directly under the regiment, and twenty or thirty buglers from the entire regiment; everyone was dressed as enemy soldiers. In addition, the dozen or so prisoners who had spoken with us were also used by them. The others followed behind, fearing that in case the trick didn't work, they would prepare to attack by force.
    At around nine o'clock in the evening, we set off in the pouring rain. It was so dark that we couldn't see the road, and the road was so slippery that it was like oil had been poured on it, and the sounds of "thump" and "splash" could be heard constantly in the queue, and almost everyone fell several times. After falling, you became a mud man. Some of the straw sandals were pulled off by the mud, and if you wanted to pick them up, the shoes were like glue stuck to the ground, and you couldn't pull them out no matter how hard you tried; throwing them away was really reluctant. If someone had to pick up the shoes, it would take a long time and affect the speed of the large army. So, enduring the pain, we said goodbye to the straw sandals that had crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, and simply walked barefoot, stepping on gravel, mud, and thorns, and continued to move forward!
    After marching quickly for more than two hours, the heavy rain stopped, only a few raindrops were occasionally thrown down from the sky. Through the darkness of the night, we saw a light hanging in the air. The prisoners whispered to us: We're here, this is the light of the sentry post on Zunyi City. At this time, we deliberately created an atmosphere of chaos and panic, and swaggered to the bottom of the city wall.
    "Who's there?!" A fierce voice came from the tower, and the bolt also rattled.
    "Our own people!" The prisoners answered calmly in the local Guizhou dialect.
    "Which unit?" the tower asked again.
    At this time, the prisoner company commander replied with a sad voice according to the content we had arranged for him in advance: "We are from the outer battalion, today we were surrounded by the Communist bandits, the village was lost, and the battalion commander was also killed. I am the company commander of the First Company and I led some of the brothers to escape with great difficulty. Now the Communist bandits are still chasing us, please open the city gate quickly and save us!"
    "What is your battalion commander's name?" the enemy asked, testing us.
    The prisoner company commander answered him without hesitation. There was silence on the tower, and they were whispering to study the situation. In order to disrupt their careful thinking and research, we organized another "offensive", and many people shouted: "Open the door quickly! Please, please! The Communist bandits are coming soon!..."
    "What are you shouting about!" A very blunt voice shouted at us, with the annoyance of not waking up from sleep; it was probably an official.
    We had to "obey" and kept quiet. Suddenly, several beams of flashlight light shot down from the tower, shining on us, as if to find out something suspicious. Little did they know that the flashlight could only illuminate our appearance, not our bones! When they were sure that we wearing the big hats were "our own people," they said:
    "Wait, don't shout, we'll open the door for you!"
    When we heard this, we all held back our laughter, quietly put on our bayonets, pushed in the bullets, and waited eagerly for the enemy to open the door to welcome the "own" "people".
    With a "crash," the door bolts were unloaded in the city, and then, with two "squeak—" "squeak—" sounds, the tall and thick city gate opened. The gatekeepers walked up to the comrades of the reconnaissance platoon walking in front and said in panic, "How did the Communist bandits cross the Wujiang River? They came so fast!"
    "Yes, we have already entered Zunyi City! Let me tell you, we are the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army!" Several tiger generals of the reconnaissance platoon pointed their guns at the temples of the two enemy soldiers.
    The two enemy soldiers exclaimed "Ah!" and handed over their guns, collapsing to the ground like noodles.
    At this time, our large army also poured into this "breakthrough point" without spending a single shot or bullet. After cutting the telephone lines and cleaning up the enemies on the tower, the twenty or thirty buglers all blew the charge horn repeatedly, and the troops stretched into the street like the wind. In an instant, Zunyi City became lively, with exciting and loud bugle calls and thrilling gunshots everywhere; everywhere one could hear the shouts of bravely killing the enemy and the cries of the enemy fleeing for their lives. A large part of the enemies were taken prisoner, and many had not even had time to put on their clothes; a small part of the enemies fled from the north gate, abandoning their families and property in a panic.
    On the morning of January 5, we announced the liberation of Zunyi City. The people came out of their homes, lined up on the streets, waving colorful flags, setting off firecrackers, happily welcoming their own soldiers, and celebrating the arrival of the day of liberation.
    Our Sixth Regiment, in addition to a part pursuing the fleeing enemies in victory, another part was doing mass work in the city, fighting local tyrants, and confiscating the property of warlords and landlords. The next day, we received orders to go north again, and then took the county town of Tongzi north of Zunyi.
    We reorganized in Tongzi for more than ten days. We knew that during this period, the Party Central Committee was holding an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in Zunyi, which was of great significance in the history of the Party. At the meeting, the new leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong was established, the erroneous "Left" leaning military line was negated, and the crisis of the Party and the revolutionary cause was saved, and from then on, we have been moving towards the victory of today.

    夜取遵义
    铁道兵副政治委员少将　王集成
    1935年1月3日拂晓前，接到师政委刘亚楼同志的电话，他说：“四团现在已经突破了乌江防线，控制了渡口，你们六团立即跨过江去，迅速前进，直取遵义城！”
      一听这个任务交给了我们，真乐极了；摸着黑，我们就出发了。虽然乌江水急浪汹，我们坐在竹筏上就像骑着一匹断了缰绳、又没有鞍蹬的马，随时都有被摔翻的危险，但我们的心情，还嫌它跑得太慢了呢！
    天大亮，我们全部渡江完毕，随即把前进的箭头射向遵义。团长朱水秋同志骑着马，打开他那个终日不离身的皮背包，取出了五万分之一的地图，摊在马颈上，边走、边看，边思索，身子随着马奔走的步伐颠簸着。我同他并行着，眼光凝注在地图上，考虑着打遵义的战术问题。在那战争的年月里，我们很习惯于这种“鞍上办公”。
    研究的结果，确定一、二营为突击营，从遵义东、南两面突进去；三营为预备队。
    当天夜晚，我们宿在离遵义九十里外的团溪镇。
    翌日（1月4日），天还墨黑墨黑的，我们就起来了。一起来，警卫员就告诉我们说，总部的参谋长刘伯承同志来了。
    我们一听，都喜得说：“有撑腰的了！”我和朱团长匆匆地洗了脸，他去集合部队，我就到刘总参谋长那里去了。
    一跨进门槛，见刘总参谋长正在那洗脸。从谈话中，知道他是连夜从总部赶来的。然而在他那由于操劳消瘦的面孔上，找不出一丝倦意；他精神特别好。
    他问我：“王政委，你们打遵义有把握吆？”
    “我们已经研究好了，没有问题；王家烈的部队我们领教过，一定能拿下来。”接着我便把战斗的方案向他汇报了，他思考了一阵，点头同意了。
    “三个月来，我们走了四、五省，行了几千里，打了数十次仗，战士们很疲劳吧？”他关切地问道。
    “疲劳是疲劳，可大家一听说打仗，情绪就都鼓起来了，疲劳也早忘没了。”
    他笑了笑，又问：“弹药怎么样？”
    “满够。仗越打得多，弹药就越多；这回消耗了，打下遵义我们又能补充个足足的。”我说。
    他若有所思地点点头，又严肃地说：“这次打遵义有很重要的意义啊！你们是主力部队，一路上打的仗都很漂亮，要求你们这一炮打得要更响！虽然王家烈的部队是个地方部队，但遵义城比较大，城防也较严谨，敌人三千多，咱们才一千几，困难还是有的。打仗嘛，就是豆腐也要当成石头去切它！”
    我默默的听着。他缓慢地，又叮咛道：“我们的日子是比较艰难的，要求仗打得好，但还要求人要少伤亡，子弹要节省打，这就需要多用点智慧啰！”
    我细细地琢磨着首长的话，觉得好像给我点破了些什么。我坚定地说：“首长放心吧，我们一定想尽一切办法，打下遵义！您是不是跟部队讲讲话？”
    “可以。今天我也和你们一块打到遵义去！”说着他便戴上了他的眼镜。
    首长的担子那么重，不知几宿没睡觉了，又要和我们一块去战斗，怎么能行呢？我激动地想说什么，但又说不出来；觉得有了刘总参谋长的亲自指导，我们的腰杆就更硬梆了。
    我同刘总参谋长到了部队集合点，天已蒙亮；浓雾弥漫着，好像每个人身上都往外冒气。刘总参谋长站在战士中间，环顾了一下战士们的面孔，就亮开嗓子讲起来：
    “同志们，你们是一支模范的部队，走得快、打得猛、吃得苦、耐得劳，这次把打遵义的任务交给你们，相信你们一定能取得胜利，为我们红军在北上抗日的道路上扫除这一障碍！……”
    刘总参谋长的话音还未落，战士们便纷纷挥起拳头，高呼口号，表示决心。那豪壮的声音，好像百门大炮齐放，要把遵义的敌人炸个粉碎。
    我们疾步向遵义挺进。午后，侦察员报告：在距遵义三十里的地方发现敌人的外围据点，庄里驻有一个多营的兵力。当时，朱团长便下了命令，我们的部队像一把钳子，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，钳住了这个庄子。刘总参谋长指示我们：要全歼这里的敌人，不准有一个漏网，否则，走透了风声就会影响打遵义。
    三点多钟，我们开始攻击，这时天也下起大雨。一个个被淋得好像洗了澡。但，这对于我们已是家常便饭了。遭罪的倒是敌人，他们陶醉于乌江天险的障碍，同时认为大雨天更为太平……。当他们听到枪声大作，如梦猛醒、怆惶迎战的时候，没想到早已经成了瓮中之鳖了。
    没多久，我们就打进庄去。敌营长企图逃窜，带着一股残兵在庄内东撞西闯，结果也没逃出我们的包围圈。我们完全实现了刘总参谋长的指示：这里的敌人除了死的，凡是有口气的都当了俘虏。遗憾的是，敌营长的性子太急，死得早了一步，要不当了俘虏，我们还能多了解一些有关遵义城的情况。
    遵义的触角，被我们搞掉了，相反地，倒变成我们的触角了。为了详细地了解遵义的情况，我们从俘虏中找了一个连长、一个排长和十几个成份较贫寒的士兵，进行谈话。
    一开始，我逐个地问了他们的姓名、籍贯和家庭情况。问到谁，谁就毕恭毕敬地站起来，两只脚跟一喀，战战兢兢地回答我。那位连长，也失去了以往的威风，在谈话间，惶恐的目光总不敢与我相碰，答起话来也是结结巴巴的。
    我见他们这样害怕、怀疑，首先向他们讲清了我们的俘虏政策，和说明我们红军是打倒军阀、地主，为穷人翻身的工农队伍。并根据他们的情况，还谈了些为什么穷富不平等、为什么要打倒军阀、地主的道理。最后，我问他们：“你们想想，你们当兵到底是为了谁啊？”
    有些话打在他们的心坎上了，有的在擦眼抹泪，有的在低头不语，有的说：“我们是干人（即穷人）没饭吃，才去当兵！”有两个把缀有青天白日帽徽的大盖帽子从头上揪下来，扔在地上，踩了几脚，气愤地说：
    “我们受骗了，再不给军阀、地主去卖命了！”
    我见他们开始觉醒，就说：“告诉你们，我们今天就要打遵义，你们谁详细了解遵义情况，告诉给我们，事后还有赏。”
    那位连长站起来了，点头躬腰说：“长官，红军对我们这么好，小人那敢不效劳！”接着他就把遵义的工事，守敌的实力一一讲了，并画了一幅地图。
    “都是真的嘛？”我问连长，同时又用目光问那些士兵。
    那连长殷勤地说：“小人句句是真情，如果撒谎，请长官当场杀头！”那些觉醒的士兵，也点头示意证明没有谎话。
    最后，发给他们每人三块银元。虽然，当时我们的生活很困难，没有钱，但是对俘虏我们还是仁至义尽的。他们捧着银元感激地说：“我们当官的说你们红鼻子、绿眼珠，杀人放火，抓着我们挖眼剖腹，我们真害怕，没想到你们竟是最好的人，是我们的救命恩人！”
    与俘虏谈完话，我就想：现在遵义城敌人的底细我们摸着了，同时，这里的敌人也一个没有漏网，我们为何不可以化装成敌人、利用俘虏去诈城，打个便宜仗呢？我跟朱团长一研究，他同意了；我们去报告刘总参谋长，他说：“很好，这就是智慧。”并嘱咐说：“装敌人一定要装得像，千万不能叫敌人看出馅来。”
    这出戏主要的角色由一营长曾宝堂同志带着三连、团直属侦察排，和全团二、三十个司号员来演；个个都是一色的敌军打扮。另外，那十几个谈过话的俘虏，也由他们去利用。其他的都跟在后面，恐怕万一诈不下来的时候，准备强攻上去。
    夜九点钟左右，我们冒着大雨便出发了。天黑得看不见路，路滑得又像泼上了油，队列里不时地响起“噗嗵”“啪唧”的声音，差不多每个人都要摔几跤。摔一跤后，跃身一变，就成个泥人了。有的草鞋被烂泥拔掉，要想拣起来，可那鞋就像胶粘在地上似的，怎么拽也拽不出来；扔了吧，真也舍不得。如果谁非要把鞋拣起来，就要耽搁老半天，影响大队人马行进的速度。于是忍着痛，与那跨过千山万水的草鞋恋恋不舍地告别了，干脆赤着脚、踏着碎石、烂泥、荆棘，继续前进！
    急行了两个多小时后，大雨停了，只是从天上不时地甩下几颗雨点点。我们透过夜幕看见一户灯光，吊在半空。俘虏们悄声地告诉我们：到了，这是遵义城上岗楼的灯光。这时，我们就故意制造了一种兵慌马乱的气氛，大摇大摆地往城根下跑。
    “干什么的？！”城楼上发出一句凶狠的声音，枪栓也呱啦响。
    “自己人！”俘虏用贵州本地话从容地回答。
    “哪一部分？”城楼上又问。
    这时，俘虏连长就按着我们事先给他安排的内容，悲悲切切地回话了：“我们是外围营的，今天叫共匪包围了，庄子丢了，营长也打死了，我是一连连长领着一部分弟兄好歹逃了出来，现在共匪还在追我们，请快快开开城门，救救我们！”
    “你们营长叫什么名子？”敌人考问着我们。
    那俘虏连长毫不迟疑地给他答上了。城楼上沉闷了，他们在嘀嘀咕咕地研究情况。为了扰乱他们慎密地思考、研究，我们又组织了一次“攻势”，不少的人在喊：“快开开门哪！麻烦麻烦哪！共匪马上就追来啦！……”
    “吵吵什么！”一个口气很冲的朝我们大喝一声，声音里还带着睡眠不醒的烦恼；估计是个当官的。
    我们只好“服从”下来，都不吭声。突然从城楼上射下来几道手电光，在我们身上照来照去的，仿佛要照点可疑的东西出来。殊不知，手电光只能照清我们的外表，照不到我们的骨子里去啊！当他们确实认清我们这些戴大盖帽子的是“自己人”的时候，才说：
    “等着，别吵，这就给你们开门去！”
    我们一听，都憋住笑声，悄悄地上了刺刀，推上子弹，磨拳擦掌地等着敌人开门来迎接“自己”的“人”。
    “哗啦”一阵响，城内卸下了门栓，随之，“吱——”“吱——”的两声，又高又厚的城门敞开了。开城门的恐慌地向我们走在前面侦察排的同志道：“怎么共匪已经过乌江啦？来得好快呀！”
    “是啊，现在已经进了遵义城！告诉你们，我们就是中国工农红军！”侦察排的几个虎将把枪口对在那两个敌兵的太阳穴上。
    那两个敌兵吓得“啊！”了一声，把枪一交，就像面条一样瘫在地上了。
    这时，我们大队人马也一下涌进这个没费一枪一弹的“突破口”，先割了电线，和收拾了城楼上的敌人后，那二、三十个司号员就齐声反复地吹起了冲锋号，部队像风一样向街里伸延。霎时，遵义城热闹起来了，到处响起激昂嘹亮的军号和惊心动魄的枪声；到处听见英勇杀敌的呼喊和敌人逃命的哭叫。一大半敌人当了俘虏，不少的连衣服还没来得及穿上；小半敌人从北门逃窜，也是撇家弃属，狼狈不堪。
    1月5日早晨，我们宣告遵义城解放了。老百姓们都走出家门，列在街旁，挥着采旗，大放爆竹，兴高采烈地欢迎着自己的子弟兵，和庆贺翻身喜日的到来。
    我们六团除了一部分乘胜追击逃窜的敌人外，另一部分便在城内作群众工作，打土豪、查封军阀、地主的财产。第二天，我们又接受了命令北上，继而拿下了遵义北面的桐梓县城。
    在桐梓我们整顿了十几天。我们知道，就在这期间，党中央在遵义正召开着党在历史上具有重大意义的政治局扩大会议，会上，确立了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央新的领导，否定了错误的“左”倾军事路线，挽救了党和革命事业的危机，从此，使我们一直走向胜利的今天。
