Factories, Mines, and Farms Beckon to Youth
A Large Number of Soviet High School Graduates Participate in Production
Youth from Moscow and Leningrad Will Go to the Frontier to Build Factories and Roads

This newspaper reports: These days, 1.3 million high school graduates across the Soviet Union are about to leave their alma maters and begin a new chapter in their wonderful lives. Many have chosen one of the many glorious paths before them—participating in industrial and agricultural production.

Soon, 60,000 young people will be on their way, going to northern Soviet Union and the Donbas to participate in important production and construction. Kozhibai-Kaukishev, a graduate of Koekchetav City No. 3 Middle School, will go to a pasture to herd sheep; Vladimir, the son of Gricha, a Hero of Socialist Labor and combine harvester operator, is determined to follow in his father's footsteps. An entire class of graduates from Obruchi City Railway Middle School will go to the east to build a concrete factory.

Now, factories, mines, and farms all over the Soviet Union are beckoning to the youth. The construction of new factories and mines in the Altai Territory and the construction project of the largest oil refinery in Siberia are awaiting the youth of Moscow. A large army of youth from Leningrad will cut through dense forests to build railways for the hydropower station on the Angara River. 18,000 young people from Ukraine will build mine shafts and houses for the coal mining industry in the Donbas.

    本报讯  这几天，苏联各地的一百三十万中学毕业生就要离开母校，开始美好生活中新的一页了。许多人都选定了摆在他们面前的许多光荣道路中的一条——参加工农业生产。
    不久，六万青年就要上路了，他们将到苏联北部和顿巴斯去参加重要的生产建设。考克切达夫市第三中学的毕业生科日巴依—考基舍夫就要到牧场牧羊去了，社会主义劳动英雄、收割机手格里查的儿子弗拉基米尔立志走父亲的道路。奥布路其市铁路中学一个班全体毕业生将到东部去建设一个混凝土工厂。
    现在，苏联各地的工厂、矿山和农庄都在向青年们招手。阿尔泰边疆区新厂矿的修建工作和西伯利亚全苏最大的炼油厂的建筑工程正等待着莫斯科的青年。列宁格勒的青年大军将穿过密丛的森林为安加拉河上的水电站修建铁道。乌克兰的一万八千青年将为顿巴斯采煤工业建矿井，修住宅。
