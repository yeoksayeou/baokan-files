Chen Jiageng suggests overcoming bureaucracy from both superficial and fundamental aspects.

Chairman, fellow representatives, comrades:

I have listened to the reports of Premier Zhou and Comrades Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, Zhang Dingcheng, Dong Biwu, and Minister Peng Zhen these past few days, and I completely agree with them.

Before the CPPCC meeting in February of this year, Chairman Mao summoned CPPCC members to participate in the Supreme State Affairs Conference, declaring that a rectification movement would be carried out regularly over a longer period to achieve effective results. He also encouraged a hundred schools of thought to contend, allowing the people to speak freely. If there are injustices, speak out; not speaking would be failing Chairman Mao's good intentions. This is the most wise and enlightened measure taken by the government since liberation to govern with diligence and strive for improvement. I humbly present my opinions below:

	1. The Yingxia Railway passes through very few mining areas in Fujian Province. For example, Longyan is rich in coal, iron, and cement stone, and is a famous mining area in Fujian Province. If a branch line is built from Zhangping to Longyan, it would only be 57 kilometers long. Not only would the output of minerals be unimpeded, but the 6-7 million people in southern Fujian who lack fuel could obtain cheap coal to alleviate the suffering of poor people who have to pay more than two yuan for every hundred catties of firewood. For the past two or three years, I have repeatedly petitioned Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, the National People's Congress, the Political Consultative Conference, the State Planning Commission, and the Ministry of Railways and made multiple proposals to speak for the people. Although I have been repeatedly approved, it has not been implemented for a long time. Finally, Premier Zhou told me in person last year that construction would begin this spring, but this has also become a bubble. On the other hand, the Nanfu Railway, which is 200 kilometers long and already has convenient water transportation on the Min River, so a railway was not urgently needed. However, construction began quietly last year. The price of firewood and rice is low in northern Fujian, and the land is vast and sparsely populated, so life is quite good, far better than in southern Fujian. Both are provincial people, but such a reversal shows that my repeated appeals over the years are no match for a party friend's momentary words. Although the higher authorities have issued orders, the subordinates refuse to comply.

	2. In 1953, the Ministry of Higher Education transferred a total of more than 800 students from the Engineering College of Xiamen University and the Jimei Fujian Maritime Academy to other provinces and abolished the institutions. It also ordered the Jimei Maritime, Aquaculture, and Business schools to stop enrolling students. The reasons given were that the school site was close to the front line and there was a lack of employment opportunities for graduates, while similar schools in Fuzhou and other provinces were being increased and expanded. Fujian Province was previously divided into eight districts, with a population of more than 13 million, and the two districts in southern Fujian account for about half of the population. Due to the narrow land and dense population, many people go abroad to make a living. There are 6-7 million people in Taiwan and 5-6 million in Southeast Asia. After liberation, the seaports were blockaded, and Southeast Asian countries allow people to return but not to leave. There is a lack of industry, the population is increasing daily, and people's lives are difficult everywhere. The aforementioned higher and secondary technical schools all treat students preferentially and provide free education. Since the suspension, poor students and returned overseas Chinese students have had no choice but to drop out of school, become unemployed, and wander. It was not until last year that the government planned to expand technical education in twelve years, and the Jimei secondary technical schools were able to resume enrollment, while others remained vacant. Logically, the people at the forefront should not only be treated equally by the state, but should also be given special assistance to encourage the enthusiastic feelings of overseas compatriots towards the motherland.

	3. The rectification problem this time is different from the previous Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns. At that time, economic operations had not yet been centralized, and all corruption and malpractices were mostly scattered in the commercial and industrial sectors. The government issued strict orders to be vigilant, and great results were achieved in a few months. The reason for such rapid results is that the previous corruption and malpractices were mostly caused by political corruption. Now that there is a good government, the people immediately celebrate and comply. There is no need for repeated orders and long-term publicity and admonitions to achieve results.

	4. The main problems of this rectification are that Party members are arrogant, there are internal contradictions, and there is bureaucracy and subjectivism, all of which need to be reformed and overcome. I believe that arrogance and contradictions can be effectively addressed like the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns once the government issues strict orders to be vigilant. However, bureaucracy is deeply rooted and very different, and cannot be solved by orders, admonitions, and verbal propaganda alone. Today, the nation's economic property is centralized, and authority is in the hands of a few people in various government departments. The stakes are greater than before. It is necessary to target bureaucracy in order to overcome it, and other problems can be solved easily.

	5. Bureaucracy is a habit accumulated over thousands of years in China. It harms the country and harms the people. After the establishment of the People's Government, it was declared that it would be eradicated. However, whether it is criticized in meetings or conveyed in documents, it is repeated many times, year after year. However, the effect is very small, or even intensified, and the people who lead and convey the message seem to only bear the responsibility of conveying it, without examining themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to move the listeners. As a result, the bureaucratic style is difficult to change in the old ones, and new ones appear, and they are found anytime and anywhere. With such a heavy and difficult-to-reverse trend, it cannot be solved by verbal propaganda alone. To earnestly eradicate it, we should start with both superficial and fundamental solutions.

	6. In addition to propaganda and admonitions, as a superficial solution, each province should set up investigation agencies. Those who commit this style should be dismissed and sent to specially set up training centers or schools to study and reform. They can only be tried out after graduation. As for the fundamental solution, it must start with formal school education. Our school education was established more than half a century ago in imitation of foreign countries. However, the teachers all come from the old society, and the accumulated habits have not changed, which is the source of the growth of bureaucracy. From what I have seen in decades of contact, Chinese teachers and foreign teachers have completely different styles, which shows that customs harm people and are difficult to break. The past mistakes will mislead the future. If we want to reform, we must start with increasing new education. This is not a matter of one day or two. The source of bureaucracy lies in laziness and habit, and one does not even know its drawbacks.

	7. When I was in Singapore, I saw a primary and secondary school run by an American church, three or four kilometers apart, with more than 4,000 students, most of whom commuted to school. An American named Naya was the principal of both schools and was quite busy going back and forth. Because of fundraising matters, he often came to talk to me, and on Sundays he also opened extra classes to teach voluntarily. My second son was studying at that school, and he had to attend class for two hours every Sunday, with Naya personally teaching a class of more than 30 students. In 1919, I returned to China to prepare for the establishment of Xiamen University. There was a Japanese-established elementary school in Xiamen called Xu Ying Shuyuan. The principal invited me to visit. The school was clean and tidy, with beautiful flowers and trees, but there was only one school worker. When I asked how he could take care of everything so well, he said that all the students helped out. There were more than a dozen cabinets of animal and plant specimens from the mountains and seas, which were neat and spectacular, made by the principal and two teachers who collected them and made them by hand on Sundays, none of which were purchased. The three cabinets of mineral specimens were collected by the principal himself from various places, and the other cabinets of mountain and sea specimens were collected by the two-day teachers. Such initiative to serve the society, without any bureaucratic habits, would be a miracle in Chinese schools.

	In 1950, when I went to Qingdao, the mayor of Qingdao told me that Moscow is a world-class city, and the mayor can even remember where there are a few trees in the city. The mayor of Qingdao said that he was ashamed that he didn’t know where the trees were in the small city of Qingdao. This shows that the bureaucratic style is recognized everywhere in administration.

	8. Jimei School is backed by mountains and faces the sea, five or six miles from the mountains and close to the sea. When the tide recedes, tens of thousands of acres of beach are exposed, with soil that is sandy, muddy, and semi-sandy, and can be traveled in leather boots, leather shoes, or barefoot. There are seasons for catching various marine animals, especially oysters, which have a longer production period of several months. Villagers insert stones on the beach to form fields, and oysters attach and reproduce. With such a natural environment, not to mention a range for collecting specimens, just talking about the new land and exotic scenery is of interest to the teachers. However, in the more than 40 years since the school was founded, there have been no fewer than thousands of teachers, mostly from other provinces. Seeking to go up the mountain and down to the sea once or twice, not only is there not one in a hundred, but I am afraid there is not one in a thousand. Teachers are conservative and lazy, and rarely leave their homes. If they hold national government positions, it is inevitable that they will be bureaucratic. And being in a position to teach students, they are passed down from generation to generation, so the bureaucratic style grows endlessly. I have mentioned Naya's Sunday teaching and the actions of teachers and students at Xu Ying Shuyuan in my speeches at the school many times to encourage them, but unfortunately, the listeners are indifferent and there is no response.

	I have returned to China for seven or eight years since liberation, and I am often in contact with Party members and non-Party members in my hometown. I have also repeatedly urged them to be serious and proactive in their work, but the effect is very small. Most of them have received considerable education and are loyal and capable, but their shortcomings are that they lacked diligent and active curriculum education in school at the time.

	9. The backwardness of education in Fujian. In the past, only one intermediate normal school was established in Fuzhou. After twelve years, elementary school graduates in southern Fujian still had no place to go. Each enrollment was only announced by posting notices in the provincial capital at the time of the examination. Most of those admitted were the children of relatives and friends of powerful people, and the corruption was appalling. I visited it in 1912. As the only normal school in the province, there were only more than 300 students. I recorded it in my "Memoirs of Nanyang Overseas Chinese" to express my regret. In 1917, I founded a normal school in Jimei. The principals and teachers were hired from outside the province. Either due to accidents, or due to homesickness, or because the original school was recalled, they could not stay in their positions for long. Therefore, they only sought to be smooth and uneventful and could not expect to do anything outstanding. To this day, I have not heard of any school education that is as particularly brilliant as that of advanced countries. This shows that the situation of education in our country is still backward. To change the bureaucratic atmosphere, we must thoroughly investigate the source of the disease and thoroughly reform education.

	10. Teachers, students, or cadres going to the countryside to assist farmers in their work is a good thing, especially during the busy farming season. However, participating at other times may be advocating formalism and pursuing empty fame to cover up the relaxation of their duties, which is by no means a realistic and pragmatic approach. After liberation, school courses were reformed, teaching methods were improved, and teaching materials for each subject were combined with politics and practice. Teachers' preparation work was intense, and all situations were greatly improved compared with before liberation. However, labor work on campus to develop future habits is greatly lacking. After school or during holidays are the most appropriate opportunities for students to engage in self-help activities. At this time, teachers believe that their task is over and disperse, and no one leads them. The educational shortcomings are no more than this, because cultivating a useful talent in the future, the country spends countless money and expectations, and the result is the creation of bureaucrats. Since ancient times, school teaching in our country has only been focused on books, so special attention must be paid to the fundamental aspects.

	11. Foreigners' residences are clean because the owners personally wash and sweep them. Although wealthy families have servants to assist, they rely on the owners to direct and supervise them. They clean up dirt before it accumulates and continue to do so to form a habit. For example, in Indonesian Dutch residences, furniture and houses are cleaned at least once a week, and walls and windows are kept as clean as new. The residences of Europeans and Japanese in Singapore are also the same. The reason why they are not afraid of trouble and love cleanliness is not because they were born with it. Their home countries were once dirty and unclean, just like ours. Later, they researched hygiene and believed that residences must be clean. To make every household clean and hygienic, schools must be responsible for teaching students practical labor work. Advanced countries such as Europe and the United States have developed culture and hygiene for more than a hundred years, and Japan has also developed for nearly a hundred years. They first implemented leadership in schools, and then spread it to families, and then borrowed the help of families to assist schools. Therefore, in a few years, customs became popular and spread throughout the country. Now, habits have become second nature, and the people are clean and hardworking without being supervised. Singaporean Chinese schools have hygiene and cleanliness inspections by the Department of Education two or three times a semester. Colonial education was originally classified as second-class, so it only inspects cleanliness and hygiene, but does not hold teaching labor responsible for developing habits. Our country's education authorities are actually inferior to those of colonies, and have never seen anyone come to the school for inspection all year round. Is this the same throughout the country? If it is generally recognized, how should everyone pay attention?

	12. The root cause of the decline of education in our country is the corruption of normal schools. If teachers are not qualified, then the foundation of all school graduates is not correct, and naturally they cannot serve the people well. Fortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has risen up in revolution, correctly using Marxism-Leninism to teach the people of the whole country to study hard and improve their political awareness, and only then has the achievement of eliminating corruption and reaction and establishing a people's regime been achieved. This rectification movement, with its call from top to bottom and response from bottom to top, a long-term stirring and comprehensive cleaning, can change bad habits and innovate the atmosphere. However, the crux of the matter is the so-called bureaucracy. If we want to eradicate it, it cannot be achieved by a year or two of verbal propaganda. We must start with rectifying school education. Among schools, normal schools are the most important. Normal schools are where people's teachers come from. A good teacher can influence hundreds of thousands of students, and the potential to change social customs lies entirely in this.

	13. Primary and secondary schools are also the foundation of education, and their importance is no less than that of normal schools. To break the bureaucratic style, we must first establish a labor perspective. Extracurricular labor must be led by teachers to be planned and regularized. However, it is difficult for general teachers to take on the responsibility of guiding activities in addition to their regular classes. It is possible to hire special people to do it, or reduce the number of regular classes to make them兼take on the responsibility. Labor projects include everything on campus, from windows, walls, and floors to the entire school grounds, beds, cabinets, tables, chairs, school equipment, flowers, trees, ditches, toilets, and everything else. At least once or twice a week, carry water, clean, sweep, and scrub, without avoiding labor or being afraid of dirt, and must be persistent and continuous to achieve real results. This kind of labor can cultivate hygiene, cleanliness, diligent and serious work, and exercise physical strength and habits, so that they will not lose their original nature when they leave school to take up jobs. Commuting students should also be required to participate in the same kind of labor at home, and their parents should be summoned to inform them of the benefits of rectification. Families and schools must be linked together to make it easier to achieve results, and not just rely on schools. Every three or two months, the school will organize an inspection team to inspect each student's family once, compare grades, and publicly express them. Such rectification in primary and secondary schools is not only a fundamental cure for bureaucracy, but also can make old habits realize that today is right and yesterday was wrong, influencing society, popularizing the whole country, and correcting the decadent customs can surely achieve great results early.

	14. In our country's administration, official documents are accustomed to using seals and do not emphasize signatures, which further creates a bureaucratic style. Advanced countries generally attach importance to signatures and do not trust seals. Internal and external documents of various agencies, whether handwritten or printed, must be signed by the person in charge to be valid. Due to the relationship of responsibility, it is necessary to browse it once before writing. Even if others handle the matter, the agent must sign it himself. In this way, the drawbacks of false claims, borrowing, and conflicts and errors can be reduced. If only the seal is emphasized, it is easy to cause the person in charge to be lazy to write. Even if it is printed, he may not even look at it, or even find it troublesome to stamp it, so he entrusts others to stamp it, or entrusts it to others temporarily when going out, and it becomes convenient for a long time. I have personally seen people who have been approved for months and still don't know it. In the past, there were too many illiterate people in our country who could not write their own names, so they used seals a lot. Soon, illiteracy will be eliminated, and the use of seals should be abolished and signatures should be used instead, which is also an aid to the superficial treatment of bureaucracy.

	15. The drawbacks of bureaucracy are laziness and arrogance. If a person in office has these drawbacks, even if he is clean and not corrupt, it is inevitable that he will harm the country and the people. For example, being high above and pushing everything down, never doing it himself, even faking the hand of others to sign. Relying on seals and handing them over to others to manage, or one person holding several seals, issuing documents without reading them personally, or even not knowing the situation, so the manipulation of power, the abuse of power, and the rashness of errors all arise from this. Also, sitting in the office and not leaving the house, knowing nothing about the actual situation outside and the work of subordinates. In this way, the situation below cannot be reported to the top, and all measures are divorced from the masses, coupled with a lack of humility, subjective complacency, little action, physical weakness, and especially lazy to write, how can they lead their subordinates to do a good job?

	16. Fundamental transformation requires school education as the foundation, so that there is practical labor, normal work, constant work, and constant mind, using hygiene and cleanliness without being tired or tired, so that there is no one-day exposure and ten-day cold. If the work-study program in France in the past, there were few French people and people were needed everywhere to help, and wages were calculated by the hour and by the day, even households needed them. Our country is completely different. There are very few employers in families, and there is a surplus of labor after the collectivization of agriculture. Industrial factories must have skills and there are no opportunities for half-work and half-study. Based on this, students will run into walls everywhere they work outside the school. Only by working hard in the school and leading teachers to develop their own habits can they affect families and society, be realistic and pragmatic, and make fundamental reforms. If what I say is unfounded, the medicine is not right, and it is useless. I deeply hope that the government or enlightened people will come up with other good strategies to eradicate the biggest scourge of bureaucracy that harms the country and the people. If we still stick to the previous orders, verbal propaganda, and written admonitions, it will be like "wildfires cannot be extinguished, spring breezes blow and they grow again."

### 陈嘉庚建议从治标治本两方面克服官僚主义

1957-07-03
第3版()
专栏：

    陈嘉庚建议从治标治本两方面克服官僚主义主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    我数日来听过周总理及李先念、薄一波、张鼎丞、董必武、彭真诸部长、院长同志报告，完全同意。
    本年二月政协会议开会前，毛主席曾召集政协委员，参加最高国务扩大会议，宣示以较长的定期进行整风运动，以达到实效目的。并鼓励百家争鸣，人民可以尽量发言。凡不平当鸣，不鸣则失毛主席美意。这是解放以来政府励精图治，最为贤明豁达的措施，爱将鄙见胪列于后：
    一、鹰厦铁路经过闽省矿区甚少，如龙岩方面盛产煤、铁、水泥石，为闽省有名矿区，若造一支路由漳平至龙岩不过五十七公里，不但矿产出路畅通，即闽南六七百万人口缺乏燃料，可得廉价的煤炭补救，免受每百斤柴二元多，贫民生活的苦惨。我自两三年来叠向毛主席、周总理、全国人代会、政治协商会、国家计划委员会、铁道部请求及提案多次为民请命。虽屡蒙许可，但久未实行。最后去年周总理面告今春决定动工，兹亦已成泡影。而南福铁路二百公里，既有闽江水运交通便利，铁路原非急要，乃免动声色去年便已开工。闽北柴米价廉，地广人少，生活颇好，远胜闽南，均属省民，乃如此倒置，可见我多年屡次的呼吁，不敌党友一时的片言。上峰虽有命令下属偏不奉行。
    二、一九五三年高教部将厦门大学工学院及集美福建航专学校，学生共八百余人移并他省废止机构。又令集美航海水产商科等校停止招生。其理由为校地接近前线及毕业生出路缺乏，而福州及他省同业学校则增加扩大。闽省前分为八区，人口一千三百余万，闽南二区约占半数。由于地狭人稠，故多往海外谋生，在台湾者六七百万人，在南洋者五六百万人。解放后海口被封锁，南洋各属许归不许往，工业缺乏，人口日增，人民生活困难到处多有。上言高中等技术学校，均是优待学生免费，自停止后，在地及归侨贫生，只有失学赋闲流浪而已。至去年政府拟十二年扩大技术教育，集美中等技术等校得以恢复招生，其他仍付缺如。论理处在最前线民众，国家不但当一视同仁，尚应特加扶助，以鼓励海外同胞对祖国的热烈欢感。
    三、这次整风问题，与前三反、五反不同，许时经济业务尚未集中，所有贪污弊端，多散在商工业界，政府严令警惕一下，不数月大收效果，能如此迅速者，为前贪弊之风，多由政治腐化的来，今既有良善政府，民众立即欢庆奉行。毋须三令五申，长期宣传告诫，方克收效。
    四、这次整风的主要，党员骄傲、内部矛盾、官僚主义、主观主义，需要改革与克服，我意骄傲和矛盾，一经政府严令警惕，或可如三反、五反的收效，独是官僚主义根深蒂固，大不相同，非但用命令告诫、口舌宣传所能奏效。而今日全国经济物业集中，权威操在政府各部门少数人之手，利害较前更大，必须针对官僚主义，如此方克服得来，其他问题自可迎刃而解。
    五、官僚主义系中国数千年的积习，病国蠹民莫不由此。人民政府成立后，早经宣示要予革除，如在会议上指摘，在文书上传达，不啻三令五申，无年不有。但效果甚微，甚或变本加厉，而领导传达之人，似负传达责任而已，自身未加检讨，故很难促使听者感化，因此官僚主义作风，旧者难改，新者又来，随时随地皆有发现。这样积重难返之势，非徒用口舌宣传所能奏效，要认真革除，应从治标治本两方面办法入手。
    六、治标办法，除宣传告诫外，各省应设查访机关，犯此风者即应免职，送往特设训练所或学校学习改造，结训后方得试用。至治本办法，须从正规学校教育做起。我国学校教育，系在半世纪以前仿效外国而设。但执教者都从旧社会出身，积习相沿无所改变，这即官僚主义孳长的来源。以我数十年接触所见，中国教师与外国教师作风绝不相类，乃知习俗害人，牢不易破，过去不正贻误将来，欲图改革，必由增新教育始，此非一朝一夕之故，官僚主义病源在于惰慢性成，自亦不知其弊者。
    七、我在新加坡时，见有美国教会办的小学和中学，相距三四公里，有学生四千余人，多是通学，美人那雅兼长二校，往来工作颇忙，因捐款事常来晤谈，星期日亦有另开班级义务教授。我次男即在该校读书，每星期日须上课二小时，全班学生三十余人，系那雅亲自授课。一九一九年我回国筹办厦门大学，厦门有日人设立之小学旭瀛书院，其校长邀我参观，校内花木清辉，布置整洁，而所用校丁只一人，问其何能照顾如此周到，则皆学生出力来干。所列山海动植物标本十余橱，齐整可观，由校长及两教员于星期日采集手制，皆非购买。矿物标本三橱，系校长亲自各地采取，余山海数橱系两日教员采集。这样自动性为社会服务，毫无官僚习气，若以我国学校论，可算奇迹。
    一九五○年我至青岛，青岛市长告我，莫斯科为世界大城市，市内某处有树几株，其市长尚能默识。青岛小市何处有树，彼深愧乃无所知云云。这说明官僚主义的作风乃到处行政所公认。
    八、集美学校背山面海，去山五六里，临海则近在咫尺。潮水退时海滩露出数万亩，土质有沙有泥及半沙土等，穿皮靴、皮鞋或赤足均可通行。捕取海产各种动物，各有季节，尤以牡蛎产期较长可延数月。乡人就海滩插石为田，牡蛎附着繁殖，似此天然环境，勿说采取标本的围场，只谈新到境地，异风游玩亦任教者所兴趣，乃学校开办至今四十余年，前后教师不下数千人，多来自他省，欲求其上山下海一两次，不但百无一人亦恐千中无一。教师保守惰性，足不出户率皆如是，这样起居若任职国家政务，难免其官僚主义。而居教导学生之地位，沿代相传，所以官僚主义作风长出不穷。我数次在校内讲话，常提到那雅星期教学及旭瀛书院师生动作之事以相勉，无奈听者藐藐，未见有何反响。
    解放后我回国已七八年，在梓里颇常与党员及非党员接触，对于作事认真与自动性，亦常再三劝告，而效果甚微。多受过相当教育忠实可任，其短处为当时在校内失勤敏动作课程的教育。
    九、福建教育落后的情况。当年只在福州办一中级师范学校，经十二年之久闽南小学毕业生尚无门可入。每届招生仅于临考时，就省垣揭贴通告，凡所录取多数为有力者亲朋戚友的子弟，腐败情形不堪闻问。我于一九一二年曾往参观，以全省唯一的师范学校，而学生仅有三百余人，我在南侨回忆录中曾纪之以寄慨。一九一七年我在集美创办师范中学，校长教师聘自省外，或以发生事故，或以思乡念重，或以原校追回不能久于其职。故只求平顺无事，不能望办如何出色。时至今日未闻何处学校教育，有特殊精彩如先进国者。这说明我国教育情况，尚在落后，要使它转移官僚的风气，必须切究病源把教育彻底改革才行。
    十、教师学生或干部，下乡协助农民工作，如在农忙紧张时节诚是美举。若在平时无关紧要，便往参加未免崇尚形式，追求虚名，以掩其放松本职，绝非实事求是之意。解放后学校功课改革，教法改良，各科教材结合政治与实际，教师备课工作紧张，各情况较解放前有大大进步。惟校内劳动工作，以养成将来习惯，则甚付缺如，课余或休假时候，都是学生自力活动最适当机会。此时教师认为任务终了，分头四散领导无人，教育缺点莫逾于是，盖培养将来一个有用才干，国家费去无数金钱与期望，而结果造成官僚主义者。我国自来学校教学只在书本上用工而已，故在治本方面不可不特别注意。
    十一、外国人居住地方清洁，多由主人亲自洗扫，殷富之家虽有雇佣协助，亦赖主人指挥督促，不待污秽即予洁除，不断行之成为习惯。如印尼荷人住宅，每星期家具房屋至少均洗净一次，墙壁窗户保持清洁如新。新加坡欧洲人、日本人住所也是如此。其所以不惮繁劳爱好清洁，非由本性生知，其祖国昔时污秽不洁，亦如我国一样，后为研究卫生住所必要清洁，欲使家家户户清洁卫生，必须责成学校教导学生实际劳动工作。先进各国如欧美文化卫生发达，已在百年以上，日本亦近百年，先由学校实行领导，而后传至家庭，复借家庭协助学校，故不多年风化大行普及全国。至今习与性成，民风好洁劳动毋须督促矣。新加坡华侨学校，每学期由教育司派员视察卫生清洁两三次，殖民地教育原列为次等，故只视察清洁卫生，而不责教学劳动以养成习惯者。我国负责教育机关，竟次于殖民地，终年未曾见有一人来学校查视者。这是否全国一样，如公认为是，大家应如何注意？
    十二、我国教育不振，根源由于师范学校之腐败，师资不得其人，则一切学校出身者底子已不端正，自然不能很好地为人民服务。犹幸有中国共产党起来革命，正确地运用马列主义，教导全国人民努力学习，提高政治觉悟，乃有今日排除腐朽反动，树立人民政权之成果。这次整风运动，自上而下地号召，自下而上地响应，长期激荡全面扫除，自能一变陋习革新风气。惟症结所在，就是所谓官僚主义，欲加根绝，非一年二年口舌宣传所能奏效，必须从整肃学校教育做起。学校之中尤以师范学校为主要。师范学校为人民教师所自出，一个良好教师可以影响千百个学生，转移社会风气的潜力完全在此。
    十三、中小学校亦系基础的教育，其重要亦不亚于师范。要打破官僚主义作风，必先树立劳动观点。课外劳动必须有教师领导，才有计划性，才能经常化。但一般教师要他们于正课之外，兼负指导活动之责，恐难办到，如聘专人充任，或减少正课，使其兼担则有可能。劳作项目，包括校内一切，上至窗户墙壁楼板，下则全校界地面，床橱桌椅校具花木水沟便所及其他一切，每星期至少一两次，挑水清洗扫拭，不避劳动不怕污秽，且须守恒不断，乃能收实效。此种劳作可养成卫生清洁，作事勤慎认真及锻炼体力习惯，将来出校任事庶不失其本性。通学学生，亦当令其参加家庭等样劳动，并召集其家长，告以整风之利益，家庭与学校须互相联系，方易收效，不可单靠学校云云，又三数月由学校组织视察队，巡视各生家庭一次，评比甲乙，公开表示。中小学校这样整风，不但为官僚主义的治本，亦可使旧习惯等觉今是昨非，影响社会普及全国纠正颓风定可早收宏伟的效果。
    十四、我国行政上公文书，习惯用印不重签押，更造成官僚的作风。先进各国一般重视签押，不信用印，各机关对内对外来往文件，无论手写或印刷，必须由负责人签押才为有效。由于责任关系，必经浏览一遍乃行下笔。即他人代办之件，亦须代理人亲手签押。如此则虚冒假借以及抵触错误等弊自可减少。若只重印则易引起负责人懒于执笔的心理。甚至印了就算，连看亦不一看，或竟以盖印为烦，乃交他人代盖，或外往暂时付托他人，竟以长期为便。我曾亲见有人事已批行数月，自己尚不知道。过去我国人文盲太多，自己姓名不能写，故多用印，不久文盲清除，应废止用印改用签押，这也官僚主义治标之一助。
    十五、官僚主义弊端，为懈怠傲慢，任职而有此弊，虽清白不贪污，亦难免误国病民，例如高高在上，凡事皆向下面推诿，绝不自己动手，甚至连执笔签名亦假手他人。凭用印章交他人代管，或一人数印，发出文件多未经亲阅，甚至自己尚不知情，所以弄权舞弊，轻率错误诸端，皆缘此发生。又如坐在办公厅内，足不出户，外间实际情形，属下工作状况，毫无所知。这样则下情不能上达，凡所措施脱离群众，加以缺乏虚怀，主观自满，动作寡少，体力薄弱，执笔尤怠，何能领导部属搞好业务。
    十六、根本改造故须以学校教育为基础，使有实际劳动正常工作，恒务恒心，借卫生清洁不厌不倦，不致有一曝十寒。若昔日留法勤工俭学，系法国人少，到处需人协助，工资有计时计日，虽家庭亦需用。我国绝不同样，家庭甚少雇佣，农业自合作化组后劳力过剩，工业厂须有技艺无半工半读机会。准此而言，学生要在校外工作到处碰壁，只有从校内勤劳，教师领导养成自身习惯，且可影响家庭社会，实事求是，作根本改革之办法。若以我言为河汉，医不对症，徒劳无益，我深望政府或高明人士别筹良策，根绝官僚主义蠹国病民最大弊。若仍保守前令，口舌宣传，文书告诫，只如“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。
