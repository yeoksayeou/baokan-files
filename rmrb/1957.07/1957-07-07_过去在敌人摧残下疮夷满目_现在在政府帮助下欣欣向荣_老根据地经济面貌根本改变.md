Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The restoration and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas nationwide has achieved great success.

The old revolutionary base areas encompass eight hundred and sixty-nine counties in nineteen provinces. During the long and arduous years of revolution, the old revolutionary base areas suffered severe devastation and destruction in all aspects at the hands of the enemy. For example, in Jiangxi Province, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, over a million people were massacred, resulting in a one-quarter reduction in the province's population. Similarly, during the Kuomintang reactionaries' "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Hubei-Henan-Anhui old revolutionary base area, the killing was rampant, creating many "ten-thousand-person pits" and "widow villages." According to investigations in only six counties, including Xin County, over two hundred thousand revolutionary masses were killed by the enemy. However, the people of the old revolutionary base areas did not yield. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they fought heroically and relentlessly, one after another, until victory, making tremendous contributions to the revolutionary cause.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have always cared for the people of the old revolutionary base areas. According to statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the government has allocated seventy-four million nine hundred and forty thousand yuan in special subsidies to the old revolutionary base areas from 1952 to the present, to help the people of the old revolutionary base areas rebuild their homes and develop production. Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces alone have built more than one hundred and seven thousand houses for the people of the old revolutionary base areas. Jiangxi Province recently allocated eight hundred thousand yuan to provide relief to old revolutionary workers and Red Army veterans from the Second Revolutionary Civil War period. In the past, this province also used subsidies to purchase over twelve thousand head of cattle and over two hundred and seventy thousand pieces of farm equipment for the people of the old revolutionary base areas, helping them restore agricultural production. Financial and economic departments in various localities have also given the people of the old revolutionary base areas various forms of consideration. Jiangxi Province adopted key subsidy measures when purchasing agricultural and sideline products and supplying daily necessities, increasing their income. This year alone, Jiangxi Province's reduction in salt prices has benefited them by more than five hundred thousand yuan.

With the support of the Party and the government, the economic landscape of the old revolutionary base areas has undergone fundamental changes, presenting a flourishing scene. In the old revolutionary base areas located in plains, hilly areas, and other areas with convenient transportation, grain production has mostly exceeded the level before the revolutionary struggles were launched. For example, the agricultural production in the old revolutionary base areas within Jiangxi Province has fully recovered and exceeded the highest production level before the war, with the exception of a few remote mountainous areas. The Jinggangshan old revolutionary base area has had surplus grain for export since 1955, exporting a total of two hundred and fifty thousand jin last year. In Hebei Province's mountainous old revolutionary base area, grain production reached pre-war levels in 1952 and increased by 13% from 1952 in 1955. After the realization of agricultural collectivization in the old revolutionary base areas, the local people became more actively involved in production, actively building water conservancy projects and carrying out various agricultural capital constructions, striving to further increase grain production. After the Hubei Province Hong'an County old revolutionary base area built water conservancy projects, the county's total grain output last year increased by 32% compared to 1949. Many old revolutionary base areas are mountainous, and they have also actively restored and developed animal husbandry, forestry, and local specialties. In the Gansu Province Longdong area old revolutionary base area, compared to before liberation, the number of cattle increased by 45.5%, horses increased by 122.9%, and goats increased by 74% last year. In the Fujian Province old revolutionary base area, the economic forests such as tea gardens, bamboo forests, and oil tea plantations that have been restored in recent years have reached more than sixty-six thousand mu. In order to promote the exchange of materials and develop the economy of the old revolutionary base areas, many places have also built many highways and cart roads. In the twenty-six counties of northern Shaanxi centered on Yan'an, automobiles were accessible to every county by the end of last year. Jiangxi Province has built twenty-five highways within the old revolutionary base area, stretching one thousand three hundred and eighty-seven kilometers.

With the fundamental change in the economic landscape of the old revolutionary base areas, the living standards of the people have also improved significantly. According to surveys in Ningdu, Yudu, and other counties in Jiangxi Province, more than 70% of farming households have now risen to the living standards of middle peasants. In Qigong Township, Yiyang County, before liberation, 90% of farming households lacked four months of food a year, and 8% of farming households had to go out to beg for food or rely on selling green crops, selling fields, or even selling their children to survive. Now, more than 88% of farming households are well-fed and clothed and have surplus grain to sell. In Qiling Township, Yongding County, an old revolutionary base area in Fujian Province, the entire township has built nine hundred and fifty-six new houses, and the vast majority of the masses have reached the living standard of "granaries with surplus grain" and "cotton in winter and single-layer clothing in summer."

After several years of restoration and construction, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings of the old revolutionary base areas have also been developed accordingly. Many old revolutionary base areas now have primary schools in every township. The former Suide area of northern Shaanxi had two hundred and six middle and primary schools in 1948, which increased to one thousand four hundred and thirty-nine last year, and the number of students increased from more than seven thousand four hundred to more than eighty-six thousand seven hundred. Various localities have also universally established people's schools and literacy classes, carrying out the literacy movement, so that adults have also improved their cultural level. In recent years, film projection teams in various localities, under the call of "movies going to the mountains," have gone to the mountains to show movies to the people of the old revolutionary base areas. In terms of health undertakings, most old revolutionary base areas now have hospitals in every county, and they have focused on preventing and controlling the most harmful diseases such as venereal diseases, leprosy, and schistosomiasis. In recent years, Jiangxi Province has added more than five hundred and twenty medical personnel to the old revolutionary base areas in the province, added more than eight hundred and ninety beds, and newly established more than four hundred and forty health centers and more than seventy maternal and child health stations to serve the people of the old revolutionary base areas. Various localities also regularly organize mobile medical teams to go to remote areas and mountainous areas to treat diseases for the people of the old revolutionary base areas. Due to the improvement of sanitation, several serious infectious diseases that were prevalent in the old revolutionary base areas in the past have all been eradicated, greatly improving the health level of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. The old revolutionary base areas in various localities also attach importance to the work of preferential treatment for family members of martyrs, family members of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and old revolutionary personnel. In recent years, Fujian Province has built more than fifty thousand eight hundred houses for more than seventy-four thousand elderly family members of martyrs and military personnel and revolutionary masses who have no houses or lack houses. More than one hundred thousand poor family members of martyrs and disabled soldiers in Jiangxi Province have been receiving care from substitute farming and "preferential labor days" since 1950, and their lives have also been reliably guaranteed. Various localities have also distributed pensions to poor family members of martyrs and military personnel. More than one hundred and sixty thousand families of martyrs in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces have received more than twelve million yuan in pensions in the past three years. Ruijin County has properly resettled old revolutionary personnel in the countryside, and more than six hundred people have been re-employed. Through these efforts, the flesh-and-blood ties between the Party, the government, and the people of the old revolutionary base areas have been further strengthened.

Although the work in the old revolutionary base areas has achieved great results in recent years, there are still a small number of areas where, due to poor natural conditions, inconvenient transportation, or particularly severe enemy destruction, it is necessary to continue to make great efforts to restore to the original level.

    过去在敌人摧残下疮夷满目　现在在政府帮助下欣欣向荣
    老根据地经济面貌根本改变
    新华社6日讯　全国各老根据地的恢复建设工作获得了巨大的成绩。
    革命老根据地遍及十九个省的八百六十九个县。在漫长、艰苦的革命岁月中，革命老根据地在各方面都遭到了敌人严重的摧残和破坏。例如，江西省在国民党反动派统治时期有上百万人遭到屠杀，全省人口因此减少四分之一。又如国民党反动派对鄂豫皖老根据地的“围剿”中，杀人盈野，制造了许多“万人坑”、“寡妇村”，仅据新县等六个县的调查，被敌人杀死的革命群众就达二十万人以上。但是，革命老根据地人民没有屈服，他们在共产党的领导下，一直英勇顽强、前仆后继地战斗到胜利，对革命事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    解放以来，党和政府一直关怀着老根据地人民。据内务部统计，政府从1952年到现在，拨给老根据地的特殊补助费有七千四百九十四万元，帮助老根据地人民重建家园，发展生产。福建、广东、江西三省就为老根据地人民修建了十万七千多间房屋。江西省最近拨出八十万元救济第二次国内革命战争时期的老革命工作人员、老红军荣誉军人。这个省过去还用补助费为老根据地人民购置了一万二千多头耕牛和二十七万多件农具，帮助他们恢复农业生产。各地财经部门也给老根据地人民多方面的照顾。江西省在收购农、副业产品和供应日用品时，采取了重点贴补办法，使他们增加收入。江西省今年仅降低盐价一项，就使他们受益五十多万元。
    在党和政府的扶植下，老根据地的经济面貌已经发生了根本的变化，呈现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。处在平原、丘陵地区和其他交通方便地区的老根据地，粮食产量多已超过当地展开革命斗争前的水平。如江西省内各老根据地的农业生产，除少数深山僻壤地区外，已全部恢复并超过了战前的最高生产水平。井冈山老根据地从1955年起就有余粮外调，去年一年共调出粮食二十五万斤。河北省山区老根据地粮食产量1952年就达到了战前水平，1955年又比1952年增加了13％。在老根据地实现了农业合作化以后，当地人民更加积极生产，并积极兴修水利，进行各项农业基本建设，争取进一步提高粮食产量。湖北省红安县老根据地兴修水利以后，去年全县粮食产量比1949年增加了32％。许多老根据地系山区，还积极恢复和发展了畜牧业、林业和土特产。甘肃省陇东地区老根据地的畜牧业，拿去年和解放前相比，牛增加了45.5％，马增加了122.9％，山羊增加了74％。福建省老根据地几年来恢复的茶园、竹山、油茶等经济林，达到了六万六千多亩。为了促进老根据地的物资交流，发展老根据地经济，许多地方还修建了很多公路和车马大道。以延安为中心的陕北二十六个县，去年年底已县县通了汽车。江西省在境内老根据地修筑了二十五条公路，长达一千三百八十七公里。
    随着老根据地经济面貌的根本改变，人民的生活水平也有了显著的提高。据江西省宁都、雩都等县调查，目前已有70％以上的农户上升到中农的生活水平。弋阳县漆工乡在解放前有90％的农户一年缺四个月口粮，8％的农户要出外讨饭或依靠卖青苗、卖田地甚至卖儿鬻女度日，现在，88％以上的农户已经是丰衣足食并且还有余粮出卖。福建省老根据地永定县岐岭乡全乡已修建了九百五十六间新房，绝大部分群众已达到“囤里有余粮”和“冬有棉、夏有单”的生活水平。
    经过几年来的恢复和建设，老根据地的文教、卫生事业也得到了相应的发展。许多老根据地现在乡乡有了小学。原陕北绥德专区在1948年有中、小学二百零六所，去年增加到了一千四百三十九所，学生由七千四百多人，增加到了八万六千七百多人。各地还普遍设立民校和识字班，开展扫盲运动，使成年人也提高了文化。几年来各地的电影放映队在“电影上山”的号召下，纷纷上山为老根据地人民放映电影。在卫生事业方面，现在多数老根据地已县县有了卫生院，并且着重开展了对为害最重的如性病、麻疯病、血吸虫病等疾病的防治工作。江西省几年来给省内各老根据地增派了五百二十多名医务人员，增添了八百九十多张病床，新建立了四百四十多个卫生所和七十多个妇幼保健站，为老根据地人民服务。各地还经常组织巡回医疗队去边远地区和山区为老根据地人民治疗疾病。由于卫生状况的改善，已使各老根据地过去流行的几种严重传染病全部绝迹，大大提高了老根据地人民的健康水平。各地老根据地还重视烈属、军属、残废军人和老革命人员的优抚工作。福建省几年来为七万四千多个无房或缺房的老年烈军属和革命群众修建了五万零八百多间房屋。江西省十万多户贫苦烈军属和残废军人，自1950年起就受到了代耕和“优待劳动日”的照顾，他们的生活也得到了可靠的保证。各地还向贫苦烈、军属发放了抚恤金。福建、江西两省十六万多户烈士家属最近三年来就领到抚恤金一千二百多万元。瑞金县对在乡的老革命人员都进行了妥善安置，重新担任工作的有六百多人。通过这些工作，进一步密切了党、政府和老根据地人民的血肉联系。
    几年来老根据地工作虽然取得了巨大成绩，但是仍有一小部分地区因自然条件较差、交通不便或遭受敌人的摧残特别严重，要恢复到原有水平还需要继续作很大努力。
