London Dispatch from Our Newspaper, July 5th – After issuing a vaguely worded communique, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference concluded on the afternoon of the 5th.

The lengthy ten-day discussions and the empty communique reflect the complex relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth countries, as well as the difficulties Britain encounters in trying to strengthen its ties with the Commonwealth countries.

Opinions Differ Widely on the Middle East Issue

The Middle East issue was included on the agenda as an important item. It seems that the Prime Ministers accepted Macmillan's advice: forget the Suez War and look to the future. However, apart from hoping for an early resolution of the remaining Suez Canal shipping issues, the conference was unable to find common ground in discussing the Middle East issue. It is revealed that Prime Minister Nehru adopted a negative attitude towards the Baghdad Pact and the "Eisenhower Doctrine"; the Prime Minister of Pakistan demanded full support for them; and some countries, although not enthusiastic about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," were "interested" in its "economic aspects."

Britain's Investment in Commonwealth Countries is Willing in Spirit but Weak in Power

The discussion of economic issues at the conference involved many aspects, but no concrete decisions were made on major issues. All Commonwealth countries have asked Britain to expand investment. India alone needs 900 million pounds in the next four to five years. The difficulty is that Britain can only provide 170 to 200 million pounds annually. In addition, British monopoly capital is also unwilling to develop industries in Commonwealth countries that conflict with its interests. It is revealed that Macmillan believed at the meeting that India was "moving too fast" and that "the current approach exceeds its capabilities." During the conference, local newspapers also revealed Britain's dissatisfaction with the economic policies of some Commonwealth countries, for example, they pointed out that India "lacks sympathy" for private investment. The meeting believed that capital could be absorbed from "other sources," but the situation created by American capital in Canada should be avoided. When discussing the proposed "European Free Trade Area," all Prime Ministers opposed including agricultural products. They believe that this organization may be beneficial to other countries, but not to their own. Britain originally hoped to strengthen its position in the Western European market on the one hand, while at the same time not weakening its position in the Commonwealth countries' market. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that if Britain does not participate in the "Free Trade Area," it will be excluded from the Western European market; if it joins the organization, the imperial preference system will virtually cease to exist, which will inevitably lead to a weakening of trade relations between Britain and the Commonwealth countries. The conference communique stated that the issue of the "Free Trade Area" will continue to be discussed by officials of various countries.

Clear Differences Between Britain and India on Hydrogen Bomb Policy

On the hydrogen bomb policy, Britain and India showed clear differences. Nehru demanded a halt to hydrogen bomb tests. The discussion of "defense" issues at the Commonwealth Conference (without the participation of India and Ceylon) mainly focused on how to deploy British military forces on the basis of an "atomic strategy." The conference communique did not mention a word about "defense" issues. British government spokespersons also remained silent on this matter.

The meeting discussed the issue of restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. Britain still adheres to its past policy, believing that the time is not ripe to resolve this issue.

Britain's Wishful Thinking Does Not Come True

For a long time, the ruling group in Britain has been trying to hold on to Western Europe with one hand and the Commonwealth with the other, in order to enhance its international status and enable itself to stand between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, this conference shows that Britain's efforts to strengthen its ties with the Commonwealth countries and end the centrifugal tendencies within the Commonwealth have not achieved much success. Because on diplomatic issues, Britain lacks a common policy to unite the Commonwealth; and economically, it is unable to supply capital to the Commonwealth countries.

### 英联邦总理会议表明  英国在外交上缺乏维系联邦的政策  在经济上无力供给联邦国家以资本

    英联邦总理会议表明
    英国在外交上缺乏维系联邦的政策
    在经济上无力供给联邦国家以资本
    本报伦敦5日电　在发表了一个措词含混的公报以后，英联邦总理会议已在5日下午闭幕。
    为期十天的冗长讨论和会议发表的空洞公报，反映了英国同联邦国家间错综复杂的关系，以及英国企图加强同联邦国家的维系上所遇到的困难。
    在中东问题上意见纷纭莫衷一是
    中东问题是作为一个重要的项目列入议程的。看来，各国总理接受了麦克米伦的劝告：忘掉苏伊士战争，展望将来。但除了希望尽早解决苏伊士航运的遗留问题以外，会议在讨论中东问题时，没有能够找到共同语言。据透露，尼赫鲁总理对巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”采取了否定的态度；巴基斯坦总理则要求对它们给予全力支持；某些国家虽然并不热衷于“艾森豪威尔主义”，但对它的“经济方面”“感到兴趣”。
    英国对联邦国家的投资是心有余
    会议对于经济问题的讨论，牵涉到很多方面，但在重大问题上，都没有作出具体决定。各联邦国家都要求英国扩大投资。仅印度一个国家，在今后的四、五年内，即需九亿英镑。而困难是，英国每年能拿出来的，只有一亿七千万到两亿英镑。另外，英国的垄断资本也不愿意在联邦国家内发展和它的利益相冲突的工业。据透露，麦克米伦在会上认为印度“走得太快”，“现在的作法超过了它的能力”。在会议期间，此间报纸还透露了英国对某些联邦国家的经济政策的不满，例如，他们指出，印度对私人投资“缺乏同情”。会议认为可以从“其他方面”吸收资本，但要避免美国资本在加拿大所造成的局面。在讨论到拟议中的“欧洲自由贸易区”时，各国总理都反对把农产品包括在内。他们认为这个组织对于别的国家也许是有好处的，而对于各该国家自己，则是没有好处的。英国原来希望一方面能加强它在西欧市场上的地位，而同时又毫不削弱它在联邦国家市场上的地位。但是，困难在于：如果英国不参加“自由贸易区”，它将被排斥在西欧市场之外；如果参加了这个组织，帝国优惠制实际上就不再存在，结果必然导致英国与联邦国家间贸易关系的削弱。会议公报说，“自由贸易区”的问题将由各国官员继续讨论。
                在氢弹政策上英印分歧明显
    在氢弹政策上，英国和印度表现了明显的分歧。尼赫鲁要求停止氢弹试验。而联邦会议对于“防务”问题的讨论（印度、锡兰没有参加），主要就是如何在“原子战略”的基础上部署英国的军事力量。会议公报没有一个字提到“防务”问题。英国政府的发言人对此也守口如瓶。
    会议讨论了恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位问题。英国仍然奉行它过去的政策，认为解决这一问题的时机没有成熟。
              英国的如意算盘并不如意
    很久以来，英国当政集团一直想一手拉住西欧，一手拉住英联邦，以提高其国际地位，使自己能侧身于美苏之间。但这次会议表明，英国想加强它同联邦国家的维系、终止联邦内部离心倾向的努力，并未获得多大成就。因为在外交问题上，英国缺乏团结英联邦的共同政策；在经济上，又无力供给联邦国家以资本。
