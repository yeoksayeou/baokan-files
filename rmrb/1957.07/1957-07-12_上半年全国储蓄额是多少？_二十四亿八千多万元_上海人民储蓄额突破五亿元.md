What was the national savings amount for the first half of the year?
More than 2.48 billion yuan
Shanghai's people's savings exceeded 500 million yuan

    This newspaper reports that in the first half of this year, the total balance of national savings deposits reached 2,480,240,000 yuan, an increase of more than 244 million yuan compared to the end of last year, accounting for 54.37% of the annual savings plan.
    Although the issuance of public bonds, the outbreak of influenza in various regions, and the price increases of certain commodities and rising free market prices occurred in April and May, national savings figures still increased, albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter, with only slight declines in deposits in individual regions and cities. The situation has improved since June. It is estimated that the national savings plan can be completed this year. Among them, Fujian, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have already completed their annual savings plan targets.
    The increase in deposit amounts this year is mainly due to the Party and government's call for building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, which has been widely echoed by the people. In addition, the simplification of deposit and withdrawal procedures by banks has also facilitated and encouraged people to deposit unused or temporarily unused money into banks. (Zhang Jiapei)
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: According to statistics from the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China as of July 5th, the city's deposit balance has reached more than 500.1 million yuan, an increase of 23 and a half times compared to the end of 1949.
    The savings deposits of the people of Shanghai have been growing every year, and the proportion of fixed deposits among citizens has also been gradually increasing. Currently, fixed deposits account for 77.5% of total deposits.
    Shanghai workers are important bank depositors. In the Cao Yang New Village residential area, which has 6,500 households, the average deposit per household in the bank is 73 yuan.

    上半年全国储蓄额是多少？
    二十四亿八千多万元
    上海人民储蓄额突破五亿元
    本报讯　今年上半年，全国储蓄存款总余额达二十四亿八千零二十四万多元，比去年年底增加二亿四千四百多万元，为全年储蓄计划数的54.37％。
    今年4、5月份虽因公债入库，各地发生流行性感冒，以及某些商品提价和自由市场物价上涨，但全国储蓄数字仍有上升，上升幅度较第一季度缓慢，只有个别地区和城市存款略有下降。6月以来情况已有好转。估计今年能够完成国家储蓄计划。其中福建、贵州、云南三省已完成全年储蓄计划数字。
    今年存款额增加，主要原因是党和政府提出勤俭建国、勤俭持家的号召，得到广大人民的响应。此外，银行简化存取手续后，也便利和鼓励了人们将不用或暂时不用的钱存入银行。　（张佳佩）
    据新华社上海11日电　据中国人民银行上海市分行到7月5日的统计，全市存款余额已达五亿零一百多万元。比1949年底增加了二十三倍半。
    上海人民的储蓄存款每年都在增长，而且市民定期存款比重也逐步上升。目前，定期存款占总存款77.5％。
    上海工人是银行的重要储户。工人居住区曹杨新村六千五百户，平均每户在银行存款达七十三元。
