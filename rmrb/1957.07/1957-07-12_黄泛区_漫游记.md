A Ramble Through the "Yellow Flood Area"
Kǎn Fēng

Recently, I found a report from nine years ago by the Henan Branch of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) regarding the Yellow Flood Area. It stated:

"Eastern Henan, bordering western Anhui... was once known as the most prosperous area in the Central Plains. In 1938, the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou, about 40 li northeast of Zhengzhou, and the torrential muddy currents flowed directly southeast. Initially, the water flowed between Jingshui (a village in the suburbs of Zhengzhou today) and Zhengzhou, only about three li wide. After merging with the Jialu River, it widened to over twenty li, increasing to thirty li within Zhongmu County, and reaching over a hundred li in Weishi... Flooding affected the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu... Henan suffered the most extensive area and the most severe disaster, affecting a total of twenty counties...

"...During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, official and civilian dikes suffered a total of thirty-two breaches, ninety-one locations. This led to spreading overflows and sediment, increasingly escalating into a desolate wasteland, filled with desolation... As the ancients said, 'Birds cannot fly down, beasts die without their herds,' applying this to the flood area is not an exaggeration, and only describes two or three tenths of the reality... The once happy land of the Central Plains is now a hell on earth."

Nine years have passed since then. How has this "once happy land of the Central Plains, now a hell on earth" changed?

The following are the observations of a reporter on a recent trip to this area.

		Huayuankou Ferry: Talking About the Past and Present

Traveling northeast from Zhengzhou by bicycle for about two hours, you arrive at Huayuankou. Passing through the last village close to the Yellow River levee, you hear the booming sound of water – at the magnificent levee, the newly built Huayuankou Yellow River Diversion and Siltation Project headgate, completed last year, is spewing out surging yellow water to irrigate the land in this area. After the completion of the entire Yellow River Diversion and Siltation Project, not only can the 260,000 mu of farmland in Zhongmu and the suburbs of Zhengzhou, which have suffered from Yellow River disasters in the past, be irrigated with Yellow River water, but also the large amount of sediment carried in the river can be used to turn large tracts of alkaline wasteland into fertile fields through siltation.

Not far down the levee from the left side of the headgate is the section where the Kuomintang breached the dike nineteen years ago. Below the levee, which is estimated to be more than a thousand meters long, there is still a large pool of water close to the levee. It is said that this was originally a good piece of land, but after the breach in 1938, it was washed into a bottomless deep pit. Since the closure of Huayuankou ten years ago, the water in this large pool has risen every flood season as the river water outside the dike rises. Therefore, it is regarded as a serious hidden danger to this section of the levee. After the Huayuankou Yellow River Diversion and Siltation Project was basically completed last year, the Yellow River Diversion and Siltation Project Office used this large pool as a natural settling pond when releasing water for irrigation. After more than half a year of natural siltation, the deepest part of the pool has changed from more than ten meters in the past to two or three meters. This year, the Zhengzhou Aquatic Products Company and nearby agricultural cooperatives plan to make some minor repairs and use this large pool to raise fish or develop other aquatic products to meet the needs of the citizens of Zhengzhou.

Standing on the Yellow River levee and looking far away: In the center of the rolling Yellow River waters, convoys of wooden sailing ships come and go; vehicles busily load and unload ships at the ferry. Inside the levee, in the boundless wilderness, golden waves of wheat roll, and groups of agricultural cooperative members are busy harvesting; at the village heads surrounded by green shade, towering wheat stacks have begun to appear... A Yellow River management worker named Li Ruzhang told me that nineteen years ago, at this time, he and other Yellow River management workers were being coerced by the Kuomintang to breach the dike and release water here. His family lived in Qiaobei Li Village, not far from here. Since the Yellow River breached, his family had fled famine and wandered for a full four or five years.

Facing the boundless wilderness, I seemed to see the rolling Yellow River water wantonly engulfing fields and villages, the golden wheat all washed away, and in the village, on rooftops and tree branches, people were everywhere crying "Help!"... But this tragic scene quickly disappeared from my mind, and what reappeared before my eyes was a magnificent blueprint sketched out for me not long ago by a person in charge of the Huayuankou Yellow River Diversion and Siltation Project Management Office: In the near future, in addition to continuing to use Yellow River water for siltation and irrigation of farmland, they will also use Yellow River water to replenish the Jialu River, so that ships loaded with various industrial and agricultural products from the suburbs of Zhengzhou can navigate this river, which was once silted up by the Yellow River during the flood, all the way to the heart of the Yellow Flood Area – the towns of Xihua, Fugou, and other counties; in addition, they will use Yellow River water to transform the low-lying and saline-alkali land in this area into rice paddies. At that time, the Huayuankou area, which has suffered from Yellow River disasters, will become a rich "Little Jiangnan" with bustling boats and continuous rice and wheat fields.

		In the Heart of the "Yellow Flood Area"

Traveling southeast from Huayuankou for about three hundred li, you arrive at the heart of the former Yellow Flood Area, which is now known as the "granary" of Henan, producing abundant wheat. According to the负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) of the CCP Xuchang Prefectural Committee, Xihua and Fugou counties alone contribute almost a quarter of the wheat turned over to and sold to the state each summer from the fifteen counties in the entire prefecture.

If I hadn't heard some historical information about the "Yellow Flood Area" in the past, it would have been impossible to tell that this area was still a desolate grassland with almost no trees in 1947 and 1948. Look! The boundless wilderness is a sea of golden wheat, and village after village in the distance, are all green trees reflecting white walls...

I perused some production development figures for Xihua and Fugou counties, and here I saw an astonishing speed that could only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party. Taking Xihua County as an example, the county produced more than 45 million jin of wheat in 1950, while last year, despite suffering from continuous rain disasters during the summer harvest, the total summer harvest still reached more than 156 million jin, more than three times the summer yield in 1950. In 1949, the county had fewer than 10,000 head of draught animals, and no more than a few thousand carts at most, while now the county has more than 67,000 head of draught animals, and an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 carts.

To better help me understand the changes in people's lives, farmers in Nanling Village, Xihua County, carefully guided me to visit the entire process of housing improvement after the Yellow Flood. There, I saw the only remaining place where people lived in the early days after the Yellow Flood. This type of house is similar to the thatched sheds of ordinary rural pigsties. People have to crawl on the ground to get in. Slightly better than this thatched shed is a type of house called "gable opening" by the local farmers. It is higher than the thatched shed, but much lower than the average thatched house. The door is left on the gable, and people can only straighten their backs at the ridge of the house, and usually have to bow down to walk around. In 1950, they won the first bumper harvest year after the Yellow Flood, and the aforementioned "gable opening" houses were quickly demolished, and regular thatched houses with mud walls and thatched roofs began to be built in large numbers. But now, with the improvement of people's lives, ordinary thatched houses with mud walls and thatched roofs, which people felt very comfortable living in only a few years ago, are about to become outdated. Another new type of house: tile eaves, brick walls, and plastered with lime inside and out until they shine. This type of house has become an ordinary house throughout the Yellow Flood Area.

		In the "Socialist Agricultural City"

As I was about to end this trip, I also visited the state-owned Yellow Flood Area Mechanical Farm, which used to be called the Socialist Agricultural City of the Yellow Flood Area.

This is a large mechanical farm with more than 65,000 mu of land. Walking into this farm area, you feel a unique fresh scene: on the boundless fields, neatly arranged windbreak forest lines divide the land into blocks, and a black-green alfalfa and golden wheat fields weave together into a beautiful carpet. Walking into the employee residential area, green shade lines both sides of the road, and various flowers are bright and eye-catching in front of the spacious and bright residential rooms. At night, the electric lights shine like daylight... It is truly a socialist agricultural city.

This farm was established in 1951. Its predecessor was the Yellow Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, established in 1949 after the founding of the People's Republic of China to accelerate the rehabilitation of the Yellow Flood Area. When the decision to build the farm was made in 1951, the land in the farm was still a wilderness, and the vast majority of employees still lived in tents. Every spring, during the windy season, the yellow sand covered the sky, often crushing many seedlings to death. Later, after vigorously promoting pasture rotation, improving the soil, and actively cultivating shelterbelts, the yield of wheat per mu in the worst sandy land in the farm has increased from 70-80 jin in the past to more than 200 jin.

Walking in the fields of the state-owned Yellow Flood Area Farm, I remembered a passage that Ling Jumei, a female tractor driver at the Xihua County Tractor Station, told me. When this young girl's family had just returned from fleeing famine in 1948, she had to reclaim wasteland by hand with her father because her family had neither strong labor nor production tools. When the reporter visited her not long ago, she said: "Comrade, it's only been a few years, and in the Yellow Flood Area, at least dozens of people who had similar experiences to me in the past have now learned to drive tractors! Now, cooperation has been realized everywhere, and the country is actively carrying out industrial construction. What will our Yellow Flood Area become like in a few more years or ten years?..."

I seemed to see that in the vast plains of the Yellow Flood Area, every village is like the current state-owned Yellow Flood Area Farm... countless young people like Ling Jumei are driving tractors across the wilderness...

    “黄泛区”漫游记
    阚枫
    最近，我找到了一份在九年前蒋记国民党行政院善后救济总署河南分署关于黄泛区的报告。其中写道：
    “河南东部与皖西接壤……向称中原最富庶之区。民国二十七年，黄河于郑州东北四十里许之花园口溃决，淘淘浊流直趋东南。初，水流京水（今郑州市郊一村庄）郑州间，宽仅三里，会贾鲁河后，宽二十余里，入中牟县境增及三十里，至尉氏竟宽百余里……泛滥波及豫皖苏三省……以豫境面积最广，灾情最惨，共波及二十县……
    “……计抗战八年中，官堤民埝大小决口凡三十二次、九十一处。致漫流走砂，愈演愈大，一片荒烟，到处凄凉……古人云：“鸟飞不下，兽挺亡群”“田园荒芜，庐舍为墟”，用之泛区不惟不甚，且只能道其十分之二三耳……昔日中原乐土，今时人间地狱”。
    时间已经过了九年了。现在这个当时的“昔日中原乐土，今时人间地狱”，究竟变化得怎样？
    下面是记者最近在这个地区旅行的见闻。
          花园渡口话今昔
    从郑州骑自行车东北行，约二小时便到达花园口。穿过紧靠黄河大堤的最后一个村庄，耳畔便响起了轰轰地水鸣声——在雄伟的大堤上，去年新建的花园口引黄淤灌工程渠首闸，正在喷吐着滚滚的黄水浇灌这一带的土地。引黄淤灌工程全部竣工以后，不仅使过去饱受黄河灾害的中牟和郑州市郊的二十六万亩农田可以利用黄水灌溉，并且可以利用河里夹带的大量泥沙，通过落淤的办法，把大片碱荒地变成良田。
    从渠首闸的左边沿大堤向下走不远，便是十九年前国民党在这里扒口的地段，在看去足有一千多公尺长的大堤下面，至今紧靠大堤还是一个大水潭。据说，这里原是一片很好的土地，1938年决口后，被冲成了一个无底的大深坑。自从花园口合龙至今的十年以来，每到汛期，堤外河水涨，这个大潭里的水也涨。因此，它被人们看作这段大堤的严重隐患。去年花园口引黄淤灌工程基本建成后，引黄淤灌工程处利用这个大潭作为放水灌溉时的天然澄沙池，经过半年多的自然淤淀，现在这个大潭里的水最深处已从过去的十多公尺变成了两三公尺。今年，郑州市水产公司和附近的农业合作社计划略加整修以后，就利用这个大潭来养鱼或发展其他水产，供应郑州市民的需要。
    站在黄河大堤上远眺：在滚滚的黄水中心，来往运输的木帆船成群结队；渡口上奔忙着装卸船只的车辆。堤内，在无际的原野里，金黄色的麦浪翻滚，成群的农业社员在紧张地收割；绿荫环抱的村头上，开始出现了高耸的麦垛……。一位名叫李汝章的治黄工人告诉我：十九年前的这时，他和其他治黄工人一道，正在国民党的胁迫下，在这里扒堤放水。他家住在离此不远的桥北李村，自从黄河决口后，他一家在外逃荒流浪了整整四、五年。
    面对着那无边的原野，我仿佛看到了那滚滚的黄水肆意吞没着田野和村庄，黄澄澄地小麦全部被冲走，村里，房顶上树杈上到处都有人嚎叫“救命”……。但是，这种凄惨的景象很快便在我的脑海里消失了，在我眼前重新出现的，是不久前花园口引黄淤灌工程管理处的一位负责人为我勾画出的一幅灿烂的蓝图：在不久的将来，他们除了继续用黄河水放淤和灌溉农田以外，还要用黄河的水来接济贾鲁河，使从郑州市近郊满载着各种工农业产品的船只，能够沿着这条在黄泛期间曾被黄河淤塞过的河道，一直航行到黄泛区的腹心地区——西华、扶沟等县的各城镇；此外，还要运用黄河水把这一带的低洼、土地都改变成稻田。那时，饱受黄水灾难的花园口一带，就将变成为舟船如栉，稻麦连阡的富饶的“小江南”。
      在“黄泛区”的腹心地区
    从花园口向东南行约三百里，便到达昔日黄泛区的腹心地区，这里现在被人称为河南盛产小麦的“粮仓”。据中共许昌地委负责人说，单是这里的西华、扶沟两县，每年夏季缴、卖给国家的小麦，即差不多占全专区十五个县的四分之一。
    假如不是在过去听到过一些有关“黄泛区”的历史情况的介绍，那么根本就不可能看出这里在1947年、1948年时还是一片几乎连一棵树木都找不到的荒凉草原。看！无边的原野上一片金黄，远处村庄一个又一个，都是绿树辉映着白墙……。
    我翻阅了一些有关西华、扶沟这两县的生产发展数字，在这里我看到了一种只有在共产党领导下才能达到的异常惊人的速度。以西华县为例，这县在1950年全县总共产麦四千五百多万斤，而去年全县在夏收期间遭受淫雨灾害的情况下，夏收总产量仍然达到一亿五千六百多万斤，比1950年夏季产量提高了两倍多。这个县在1949年耕畜不足一万头，大车最多不过几千辆，而现在全县耕畜达到六万七千多头，大车估计有三、四万辆。
    为了更好地让我了解人们生活的变化，西华县南凌村的农民细心地指引我参观了黄泛以后人们在住房改善的全部过程。在那里，我看到了现在还保存着的仅有的一处在黄泛以后初期人们的住房。这类房屋和现在一般农村猪圈的草棚相似，人们只有爬在地上才能钻进去。比这种草棚稍好一些的是当地农民叫做“山墙开门”的一种房屋，它比那种草棚高些，但却比一般草房低得多，房门留在山墙上，人们走进屋内除在房脊处可以直一下腰外，通常走动都得躬下身子。1950年他们赢得了在黄泛以后的第一个丰收年，前述那种“山墙留门”的房屋便很快的被拆除了，而开始大量地盖起了泥墙草顶的正规草房。但如今，随着人民生活的改善，仅仅在几年前人们感到住在里面非常舒服的泥墙草顶的普通草房又很快就要过时了。又一种新型的房屋：瓦檐、砖墙、内外都用石灰泥得发亮。这种房屋在整个黄泛区里，已变成了一种平常的房屋。
    在“社会主义农业之城”
    当我将要结束这次旅行的时候，我又访问了过去一向被称作是黄泛区的社会主义农业之城的国营黄泛区机械农场。
    这是一个拥有六万五千多亩土地的大型机械农场。走进这个场区便感到一种特有的新鲜景象：无边的田野上，纵横排列得十分整齐的防风林线把大地隔成一块又一块，一片黑绿色的苜蓿和金黄色的麦田，织成了一幅美丽地毯。走入职工住宅区，两面绿荫夹道，宽敞明亮的住室门前，各种花卉鲜艳夺目。入夜，电灯照耀如同白昼……。真的是一座社会主义的农业之城。
    这个农场是在1951年建立的。它的前身是在1949年中华人民共和国宣告成立后，为加速恢复黄泛区而建立的黄泛区复兴局。当1951年决定建场时，场内土地还是一片荒野，绝大多数职工都还住在帐篷里。每到春天多风季节，黄沙盖天，常常把很多禾苗压死。后来，经过大力推行牧草轮作，改良土壤，并且积极培育防护林网，现在场内最坏的沙地每亩小麦产量已从过去的七八十斤提高到二百多斤。
    漫步在国营黄泛区农场的田野里，我记起了西华县拖拉机站的女拖拉机手凌菊梅对我说过的一段话。这位年青的姑娘，1948年全家刚从外逃荒回来时，由于家里一没有健壮的劳动力，二没有生产工具，她不得不和她的父亲一起用手来垦荒。当记者不久前访问她的时候，她说：“同志，现在才只不过几年，在黄泛区里，过去有着像我这样经历的人，现在学会开拖拉机的，至少也有几十个了！现在，到处都已实现了合作化，国家又在积极进行工业建设，再过几年或十几年，那时我们的黄泛区究竟会变成什么样子呢？……”
    我仿佛看到了在黄泛区的广阔的平原上，每个村庄都像现在的国营黄泛区农场一样……，无数个像凌菊梅那样的青年，驾驶着拖拉机在原野上驰骋……。
