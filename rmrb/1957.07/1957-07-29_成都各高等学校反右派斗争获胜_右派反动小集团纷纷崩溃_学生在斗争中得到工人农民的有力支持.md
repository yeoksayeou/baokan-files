This newspaper, Chengdu, July 27th - The anti-Rightist struggle in Chengdu's universities has been victorious, and over 10,000 students in twelve colleges and universities have generally been tempered and improved.

Hidden Rightist elements within the student body began firing a series of poisoned arrows at the Party as early as the beginning of May, wantonly attacking the Party's leadership and the socialist system. The "Forum Society" of Sichuan University, led by a handful of dregs with Dai Yujun at its head, distributed so-called appeals to Chengdu's colleges and universities, clamoring "to reignite the torch since the May Fourth Movement, and seize back democracy and freedom with the sound of charging bugles and clashing swords." They also put forward the slogan "University students throughout the city unite and act!" This clamor was supported by Rightists in various colleges and universities, and the fire was lit. The Gong Mulin clique of Rightist elements at the Chengdu Geological Exploration Institute published the reactionary "Free Pioneer Newspaper." With the support of Rightist Professor Liu Zuyi, they incited students to strike and boycott exams, and go to Beijing to fire a shot in front of Chairman Mao. The Wen Dingxun clique of Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics also published the "Small Forum" big-character posters. At Sichuan Teachers College, Fan Tongcai and others, incited by Rightist Professor Zhang Zehou, launched attacks on the Party from all sides, their arrogance rampant for a time.

In mid-June, all schools in the city launched a full-scale counterattack against the Rightist elements. Chairman Mao's report and the editorial of this newspaper further armed the people who opposed the Rightists ideologically. In order to thoroughly refute the Rightists, students in various schools read a great deal of materials and books. The students' anti-Rightist struggle was also supported by workers and peasants, who used their own experiences and the achievements of industrial and agricultural construction to refute the so-called absurdities that the new society was in a mess. When Sichuan University criticized Feng Yuanchun, a pseudo-military officer's wife, female rogue, and member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, for slandering the Party as an exploitative group, workers from nearby factories posted slogans supporting the struggle all over the school gate. Agricultural cooperatives also sent representatives to the meeting to debate with the Rightists together with the students, refuting the Rightists theoretically and factually until they were utterly defeated and pleaded guilty.

After this complex and acute struggle, the reactionary cliques in various schools have collapsed and disintegrated one after another, and the black sheep have also been identified. The broad masses of students have generally received education and training in class struggle, and a large number of activists have emerged.

Facts have proved that many outstanding Party members, League members, and activists can withstand the tests of great storms, such as Zhou Yiye, Chen Dongming, Li Bicheng, and Nie Shuhui, who remained steadfast when they were subjected to vicious attacks and threats from the Rightists. There were also a few Party and League members, such as Dai Fengyi, who lost their stand and degenerated. In addition, some people wavered because of their unstable positions and lack of experience, and were deceived by the Rightist elements' sweet words, while others were captured by the Rightist elements and followed them, waving flags and shouting until the anti-Rightist struggle deepened, and they gradually woke up. The struggle has taught people that to be a socialist college student, they must study Marxism-Leninism, transform their thinking, and integrate with workers and peasants.

Now the struggle in various schools is developing in depth.

### 成都各高等学校反右派斗争获胜  右派反动小集团纷纷崩溃  学生在斗争中得到工人农民的有力支持

    成都各高等学校反右派斗争获胜
    右派反动小集团纷纷崩溃
    学生在斗争中得到工人农民的有力支持
    本报成都27日电　成都高等学校反右派斗争获得胜利，十二个大专学校的一万多学生普遍得到锻炼提高。
    隐蔽在学生中的右派分子远在5月初就向党射出一系列的毒箭，大肆攻击党的领导和社会主义制度。四川大学“论坛社”以戴虞俊为首的一小撮败类，曾向成都大专学校散发所谓呼吁书，叫嚣“要重新燃起五四以来的火炬，以冲击的号角声和剑戟声夺回民主自由。”他们还提出“全市大学生联合起来行动起来”的口号。这种叫嚣曾得到各高等学校右派的支持，把火点了起来。成都地质勘探学院右派分子龚慕麟小集团，出版了反动的“自由先驱报”，在右派教授刘祖伊支持下，煽动学生罢课、罢考，到北京去在毛主席面前打一炮。四川财经学院文鼎勋小集团也出版了小论坛大字报。四川师范学院范通才等在右派教授张泽厚鼓动下，从各方面发起向党进攻，气焰猖獗一时。
    6月中旬，全市各校向右派分子展开全面反击。毛主席的报告和本报社论更从思想上武装了反右派的人们。各校学生为彻底驳倒右派，阅读了许多资料、图书。学生们的反右派斗争还得到工人、农民的支持，他们用自己的亲身经历和工农业建设成就驳斥所谓新社会一团糟的谰言。川大在批判伪军官太太、女流氓、三青团员冯元春诬蔑党是剥削集团的谰言时，附近工厂工人在校门口贴满了支援斗争的标语。农业社并派代表到会和学生们一道同右派争辩，在理论上、事实上把右派驳得体无完肤，低头认罪。
    经过这次复杂尖锐的斗争，现在各学校的反动小集团纷纷崩溃、瓦解，害群之马也都被清查出来，广大学生普遍受到阶级斗争的教育和锻炼，积极分子大批涌现。
    事实证明许多优秀的党团员和积极分子经得起大风浪的考验，如周以叶、陈东明、李必成、聂树辉等，在受到右派的恶毒攻击威胁时，坚不动摇。也有少数党团员如戴凤仪等丧失立场，蜕化变节。另外有些人因立场不稳，缺乏经验，被右派分子花言巧语迷惑，发生动摇，有的则被右派分子俘虏，跟着摇旗呐喊，直到反右派斗争深入后，才逐渐清醒过来。斗争教训人们要做社会主义的大学生，必须学习马列主义，改造思想，和工农结合。
    现在各校斗争正深入发展。
