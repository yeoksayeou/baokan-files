    This Newspaper News  The Sixth Session of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, recently held in Beijing, has made new contributions to the further development of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation. This was said by Comrade N.M. Siluyanov, Chairman of the Soviet Group of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, when he met with reporters from this newspaper yesterday.

    Comrade N.M. Siluyanov said that the content and the protocol of the Sixth Session of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee have different characteristics from the previous sessions and protocols: (1) This meeting determined the direct contact between the corresponding departments, scientific research institutions, and design institutions of the Soviet Union and China. This direct contact was proposed in the past, but was not formally resolved; (2) In the past, the Soviet Union and China proposed and exchanged technical information through many departments, which was very complicated. This meeting determined that in the future, the exchange of technical information will be uniformly proposed and resolved through the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee; (3) The meeting re-examined and cleaned up the projects proposed in previous meetings that had not been resolved, solved some of the problems left over from the past, and adjusted many projects.

    Comrade N.M. Siluyanov said that after the reorganization of the Soviet national economic management work, a Committee for Foreign Economic Liaison was established under the Council of Ministers to replace the former General Administration for Economic Affairs with People's Democratic Countries, which would uniformly manage foreign economic liaison work. This newly established Soviet unified foreign economic liaison agency will promote the further development of Soviet economic ties and scientific and technological cooperation with fraternal countries.

    Comrade N.M. Siluyanov highly appraised the significance and role of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation. He said that the expansion and development of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation not only promotes the increasing growth of the national economies of the Soviet Union and China, but also consolidates and strengthens the economic strength of the entire socialist camp. Comrade N.M. Siluyanov praised the creativity of Chinese designers in using the design materials and manufacturing drawings supplied by the Soviet Union. He said that Chinese experts are able to improve and supplement the technical materials supplied by the Soviet Union based on China's situation and the experience and knowledge of Chinese experts, making their quality higher and more suitable for China's situation.

    西露扬洛夫主席对本报记者谈
    中苏科学技术合作将有新发展
    确定有关部门直接接触改进交换资料方法
    本报讯  最近在北京举行的中苏科学技术合作委员会第六届会议，为进一步发展中苏两国科学技术合作事业作出了新的贡献。这是中苏科学技术合作委员会苏联组主席尼·米·西露扬洛夫同志昨天接见本报记者时说的。
    尼·米·西露扬洛夫同志说，苏中科学技术合作委员会第六届会议的内容和会议议定书有和过去几次会议和议定书不同的特点：（一）这次会议确定了苏中两国相应的部门、科学研究机构和设计机构之间的直接接触。这种直接接触在过去提出过，但没有正式解决；（二）过去苏中两国提出和交换技术资料都通过许多部门进行，头绪很多，这次会议确定今后有关相互交换技术资料，统一通过苏中科学技术合作委员会提出和解决；（三）重新审查和清理了历届会议所提出而未能解决的项目，把过去的一些遗留的问题加以解决，并调整了许多项目。
    尼·米·西露扬洛夫同志说，苏联国民经济管理工作改组后，在部长会议下成立了一个对外经济联络委员会，以代替过去的苏联同人民民主国家经济事务管理总局，统一管理对外经济联络工作。这个新成立的苏联统一对外经济联络机构将促进苏联同各兄弟国家经济联系和科学技术合作的进一步发展。
    尼·米·西露扬洛夫同志对中苏两国科学技术合作的意义和作用评价很高。他说，苏中两国科学技术合作的扩大和发展，不仅促进苏中两国国民经济的日益高涨，而且巩固和壮大整个社会主义阵营的经济力量。尼·米·西露扬洛夫同志赞扬中国设计人员在使用苏联供给的设计资料和制造图纸时的创造性。他说，中国的专家们能够根据中国情况和中国专家的经验和知识对苏联供给的技术资料加以改进和补充，使其质量更高和更适合于中国的情况。
