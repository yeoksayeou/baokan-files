Scene: One table, one chair.
Characters: Huang Zheng (Painted Face/Jing), Tan Long—Huang’s Follower (Clown/Chou), A, B, C—Prisoners

(The play opens with Huang Zheng walking in front, followed by Tan.)

Huang (recites the introductory lines): Right and wrong are clear, two times two equals five.
Tan (recites the introductory lines): The stance is firm, absolutely no ambiguity.
Huang (introductory poem): In the past, I was a power in Jiangnan, holding life and death; Now, I hide the butcher’s knife and chant “Amitabha.” (Speaks) I am Huang Zheng, styled Longtu. I hold the position of committee member in the “Rehabilitation Committee.” My nickname is “Bao Qingtian.” Anyone of my “Blue Sky White Sun” type, bring your grievances, bring your suffering, I’ll take care of it all. Even if the Communist Party takes over the world, they won’t be able to rest easy. I’m happy to see that the weather is fine today, so I might as well go to the prison to inspect the work. First, I can conveniently visit relatives and old friends; second, I’ll just do a mute person eating dumplings.
Tan: What do you mean by that?
Huang: I know it in my stomach, understand it in my heart.
Tan: In that case, let’s go together. (Rounds the stage) Here we are, here we are.
Huang: What, is this the prison?
Tan: Exactly, this is the prison.
Huang: Why isn't there any sound of torture in the prison? They are even allowed to read and take walks. Could it be that you have mistaken the place?
Tan: No mistake, look at the words written on the door, let's go in. (Huang sits down, Tan stands aside)
Huang: Come, bring the prisoners out. I will question them myself. There must be many wrongful convictions. (Prisoner A is brought on)
Tan: The one above is the Blue Sky White Sun Lord Huang. If you have any grievances, just speak boldly. Lord Huang will take charge for you.
A: Oh, yes, yes, yes. I committed a crime, but thanks to the government’s leniency, I am being reformed and becoming a new person…
Tan: Hey! The Lord asked if you have any grievances. Who told you to say these nonsense words!
A: I have a grievance.
Huang: Tell me.
A: Wang Datou in our village is a big, big counter-revolutionary, but to this day, he is still at large…
Huang: Who asked you about these things? Get down! (A exits. Prisoner B is brought on)
Tan: The one above is Lord Huang, who specializes in the injustices of the world. Tell the truth about any grievances you have, and don't say nonsense!
Huang (looking at B, turns aside): Looking at his fair skin and tender flesh, he doesn’t look like a criminal. There must be injustice in this.
Huang: What crime has this prisoner committed? Tell me everything, so that I can acquit you.
B: Thank you, Lord. It's just that I killed someone...
Huang: Oh? You can kill people too?
B: I didn’t kill without a reason, but to avenge my father! They divided my family’s land, burned my family’s deeds, struggled against my family’s people, and cut off my father’s breath… (cries)
Huang: Oh, so you are a filial son. Commendable, commendable. This official must avenge you. But I don’t know who your father is?
B: My father is very famous.
Huang: Who is it?
B: Huang Shiren.
Huang: Oh! My cousin Shiren… (cries, the stage drums and trumpets three times) Cousin Shiren, let me ask you, now that you are in prison, who serves your old mother at home? Who raises your wife and children?
Tan: You should ask the government for relief!
Huang: In my opinion, ordering the prisoner to go home to support his family is the right thing to do.
Tan: This is a good idea. As the saying goes: saving a life is better than...
Huang: Ah! ...building a seven-storied pagoda. (To B) I intend to release you. What do you think?
B: Thank you, Lord. (attempts to leave)
Huang: Wait, step aside for now! (Prisoner C is brought on)
Huang: What crime did you commit?
C: Before liberation, I arrested students and killed Communists.
Huang: Haha, I didn’t expect you and I to be of the same kind. Delightful, delightful.
Tan: Looking at his loyal and honest face, he must have been young and ignorant and instigated by others.
Huang: That makes sense. It seems that there is a great possibility this is a wrongful conviction. After I investigate this matter, I will return to Beijing and make a big fuss with them. (Asks C) Is it true that you killed people? Were you forced to confess?
C: Reporting to the Lord, I had no choice but to do so. My superiors ordered me to kill.
Tan: In my opinion, this is just a normal job duty, and he cannot be blamed.
Huang: That makes sense. Killing a few Communists is nothing compared to what I did back then! Such an honest person, the Communist Party considers him a counter-revolutionary and suppresses him. This is a big mistake. It’s outrageous! It’s outrageous!
Tan: Lord, you came to Beijing this time specifically to overturn unjust verdicts. Someone like him should be rehabilitated.
Huang: In that case, he can be released.
Tan: He can be released.
C: Thank you, Lord. (attempts to leave)
Huang: Come back, step aside for now!
Tan: Now that you have decided to release them, why don't you let them go?
Huang: (whispering) They haven't registered yet.
Tan: Still need to register?
Huang: Fool! If they don't register now, where will we find them in the future when they develop the organization!
All: Indeed—
Huang: Meeting is like meeting an old friend.
Tan: A pile of stinky tofu. (The play ends, the curtain falls)

    黄谭探监
    方成
    布景：一桌一椅。
    人物：黄拯（净）  谭龙—黄的  随从（丑）  甲、乙、丙——  犯人
    开幕时，黄拯前面走，谭随上。
    黄（念引子）：是非清楚，二二得五。
    谭（念引子）：立场坚定，绝不含糊。
    黄（定场诗）：想当年，威镇江南，生杀由我；今日里，藏下屠刀，改念弥陀。（白）老夫黄拯，表字龙图。官居“平反委员会”委员之职。绰号人称“包青天”的，就是某家。凡我“青天白日”之辈，有冤诉冤，有苦诉苦，统统包在老夫身上。包教共产党坐了天下，也不得安身。且喜今日天气晴和，不免到狱中检查工作。一来得便访亲问故，二来，咱就来个哑叭吃饽饽。
    谭：此话怎讲？
    黄：肚里有数，心里明白。
    谭：如此你我一同前往（圆场）到了到了。
    黄：怎么，这是监狱么？
    谭：正是，这儿就是监狱。
    黄：监狱里怎么无有拷打之声，还许看书散步，莫非你认错了地方不成？
    谭：没错，您瞧门上写着字呐，进去吧。（黄归小坐，谭立一旁）
    黄：来，将犯人带了出来，待老夫亲自问话，一定有不少冤枉。（犯人甲带上）
    谭：上面是青天白日黄大人，你有何冤枉，只管大胆讲来。有黄大人替你作主。
    甲：哦，是是是。我犯了法，多蒙政府宽大，改造与我，成为新人……
    谭：哎！大人问你有无冤枉，谁叫你说这些废话呀！
    甲：有冤。
    黄：讲来。
    甲：我们村里王大头，是个大大的反革命，事到今日，逍遥法外……
    黄：那个问你这些？下去！（甲下。犯人乙带上）
    谭：上面是黄大人，专管天下冤屈之事，你有什么冤枉，从实讲来，可别说废话啊！
    黄（看乙介，背工）：看他皮白肉嫩，不像犯法之人。其中必有冤情。
    黄：这一犯人，身犯何罪？一一诉来，老夫也好开脱与你。
    乙：多谢大人。只因小人杀了人……
    黄：哦？你也会杀人？
    乙：小人并非无故杀人，乃是替父报仇啊！他们分了我家的地，烧了我家的契，斗了我家的人，断了我爹爹的气……（哭介）
    黄：哦，原来是个孝子，可敬可敬。本官一定要替你报仇雪恨。但不知你父亲是哪一个？
    乙：提起我父，大大有名。
    黄：是哪一个呢？
    乙：黄世仁。
    黄：哎呀！世仁宗兄……（哭介，场面吹打三枪）黄世兄，我来问你，你坐了牢，堂上老母何人侍奉？堂下妻儿何人抚养？
    谭：应该去叫政府救济呀！
    黄：依我之见，勒令犯人回家，抚养家小，才是正理。
    谭：这是好主意。常言道：救人一命，甚是希里糊涂……
    黄：唉！胜造七级浮屠。（向乙）老夫有意释放与你，你意下如何？
    乙：多谢大人（欲下介）
    黄：且慢，暂且退立一旁！（犯人丙带上）
    黄：身犯何罪？
    丙：解放前抓过学生，杀过共产党。
    黄：哈，不料你我乃是同道。可喜可喜。
    谭：看他面带忠厚，想必是年幼无知，受人主使。
    黄：此话有理。看来这案件十有六七定是冤情。待我查明以后，将来回京，定要与他们大闹一场。（问丙）你杀人可是真的？有没有屈打成招？
    丙：禀大人，我也是不得已而为之，是上司要我杀的。
    谭：我看呐，此乃一般职务行为，不能怪罪与他。
    黄：此话有理。杀了几个共产党，比起老夫当年，算得了什么！这样的老实人，共产党也当他反革命来肃，此乃大大的错误。真是岂有此理！岂有此理！
    谭：大人此番出京。专在平反。像他这般情形，就该平了才是。
    黄：如此说来，他也是放得的。
    谭：放得的。
    丙：多谢老爷（欲下介）
    黄：回来，暂且退立一旁！
    谭：既然判定要放，就让他们走吧？
    黄：（小声）他们还没登记呐。
    谭：还要登记？
    黄：蠢材！现在不登记，日后发展组织，可上哪里找他们去！
    众：正是——
    黄：相见亲如故。
    谭：一堆臭豆腐。（尾声，幕落）
