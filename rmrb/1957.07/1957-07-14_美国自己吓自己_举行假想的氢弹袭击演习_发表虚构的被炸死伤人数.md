    America Scares Itself
    Conducting Imaginary Hydrogen Bomb Attack Drill, Publishing Fictitious Casualty Figures
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th: The United States held another "imaginary hydrogen bomb attack" drill nationwide on July 12th.

    On this day, air raid sirens sounded across the country. Upon hearing the alarm, U.S. President Eisenhower immediately boarded a helicopter with dozens of his key aides and flew to a temporary shelter two hundred miles from Washington to continue commanding the country under "imaginary hydrogen bomb attack."

    Scary "news" reports were issued one after another from the "Emergency News Center": "More than a hundred important American cities were bombed," "The number of deaths caused by bombings in New York, Washington, and other important cities is in the millions," "In New York alone, there were 4.5 million casualties."

    The entire United States acted as if it were real. Cities fell silent one by one as the "imaginary planes" passed over. City streets became desolate, and all kinds of industrial machinery stopped operating. Fifteen minutes after the "imaginary planes" passed, all towns and large cities were as silent as death.

    Somewhat spoiling the mood for the U.S. government was that some residents did not "fully cooperate." In New York, many people did not go to bomb shelters after hearing the air raid alarm. Ten pacifists opposed to war were arrested for refusing to enter bomb shelters, and they were sentenced to thirty days in prison.

    This is the fourth consecutive year that the United States has held such a nationwide exercise.

    美国自己吓自己
    举行假想的氢弹袭击演习  发表虚构的被炸死伤人数
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国全国在7月12日又举行了一次“假想的氢弹袭击”演习。
    这一天，全国各地都放起空袭警报。美国总统艾森豪威尔在听到警报之后，立刻和他的几十个主要助手坐着直升飞机飞往离开华盛顿二百英里的一个临时隐蔽处去，继续指挥这个遭到“假想的氢弹袭击”的国家。
    从“紧急新闻中心”发出一条接着一条吓人的“新闻”来：“一百多个美国重要城市遭到轰炸”，“在纽约、华盛顿和其他重要城市轰炸造成的死亡数以百万计”，“单是在纽约一地的死伤就有四百五十万人”。
    美国全国都假戏真做。城市随着“假想的飞机”的经过，一个一个沉寂下来了。城市的街道变得荒凉了，各种各样工业机器停止不开动了。在“假想的飞机”飞过之后的十五分钟，所有市镇和大城市都像死一般地沉寂。
    对美国政府说来有点煞风景的是，有些居民没有同它“充分合作”。在纽约，有好些人在听到空袭警报之后都没有到防空洞里躲起来。有十个反对战争狂的和平主义者还因为拒绝进防空洞而被政府逮捕，他们并且被判处三十天徒刑。
    这已经是美国连续第四次举行一年一度的这样全国性演习了。
