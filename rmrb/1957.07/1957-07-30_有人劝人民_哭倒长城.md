Some People Advise the People to "Cry Down the Great Wall"
		Shan Bai
    The June issue of "Beijing Literature" published a short article called "Random Talk," titled "Wall" (signed He Feng). In this article, the author talks about everything under the sun, from ancient to modern times, seemingly only wanting to subtly criticize the sectarianism of Communist Party members, without any malice. However, upon closer examination, readers will find that the author actually makes extremely one-sided estimations, dark descriptions, and malicious provocations regarding the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the masses.

    The sectarianism of Communist Party members in ideology and style is something that should be criticized and overcome. This kind of undesirable habit does indeed exist. Some Party members are arrogant because of their contributions, do not respect non-Party members, and lack the Party's fine traditions and habits of humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, which has led to alienation from the masses in some work units. This phenomenon seriously damages the work and violates the Party's mass line. Therefore, the Party promptly launched a rectification movement, resolutely demanding that Communist Party members correct their mistakes. At the same time, the Party also pointed out that non-Party members should also eliminate their attitude of estrangement and suspicion towards Communist Party members, be open and honest, and be brave in fulfilling their duties.

    Does the opinion put forward by the author of "Wall" basically conform to this spirit? It is true that the author is calling for "dismantling the wall." However, the emotions expressed in the article show a great aversion to today's reality, the Party's leadership position, and the relationship that should exist between the Party and the masses. We are against walls and ditches between the Party and the masses, but the author does not say a single word in his article affirming the leadership position of the Party and the working class, not a single word affirming the correct boundaries that should exist between the Party and the masses, nor a single word affirming that the relationship between the Party and the masses is basically harmonious today. Our Party is indeed working for the benefit of the masses, and the masses wholeheartedly support the Party. If we deny these things, we cannot explain every task we have accomplished, nor can we explain the great achievements we have made in all aspects. The author even uses extremely exaggerated metaphors to lump today's reality together with the era of feudal autocratic emperors. The author says: "...Qin Shi Huang was an expert in building walls... This wall was built by enslaving the people, and therefore Qin Shi Huang also invisibly built another kind of wall - isolating the people from himself. Meng Jiangnu crying about the Great Wall thus came about. It is said that the Great Wall was cried down, and I think this is precisely the people's wish - to cry down the latter kind of wall." The author even suggests that Qin Shi Huang's Great Wall played a protective role and was therefore praised by later generations, while the walls of later generations are "solemn fortifications" that the people "despise."

    Obviously, the author has been stimulated to the point of fever pitch by the "rampant" calls for "dismantling the wall" for a time, exaggerating after exaggerating. He associates the wall with the Great Wall, the Great Wall with Meng Jiangnu crying down the Great Wall, and then with Qin Shi Huang. Like a magician, he deliberately uses a series of exaggerated associations to mix together everything that is essentially completely opposite, making it impossible for people to distinguish right from wrong, as if the Communist Party is no different from autocratic rulers! As if the Communist Party is also enslaving the people! As if the walls and ditches between the Party and the masses that exist in some work units are not due to the sectarianism of some Party members, but because the Party itself has the nature of enslaving the people, thus isolating itself from the people and building a Great Wall! This absurd association and insinuation can only be said to be the author's distortion and slander of today's reality. It does not help to improve any work, but only exposes the author's dark psychology and extreme dissatisfaction or even hostility towards reality. We must question the author: Is there such a sharp state of opposition between our Party and the masses today as "Meng Jiangnu crying about the Great Wall"? Why do you want to do this provocative incitement? We cannot help but suspect that what you are calling for, "everyone pushing, the wall falls," is not really to help the Party improve its relationship with the masses and remove the "wall" that hinders the relationship between the Party and the masses, but to instigate people to rise up to overthrow the Party and the Party's leadership!

    Perhaps some people will say that a metaphor is just a metaphor, and metaphors are always clumsy and should not be taken seriously. However, since there are so many metaphorical words in this article, we can only discuss metaphors on the basis of metaphors. In addition to the metaphor of Qin Shi Huang building the Great Wall, there are several other metaphors, including the following passage that is like a metaphor and yet not like a metaphor:

    "Later generations of dignitaries not only have large mansions - which of course have superior walls, but also iron barbs on the walls; the civilized ones are electrified. What are they defending against? Thieves. However, anyone who approaches these solemn fortifications will cast a disdainful glance."

    This time, what appears before us is finally no longer the image of an autocratic emperor. The spiritual world in the author's mind has taken a step forward and become the society of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie or the comprador bourgeoisie. If the author is still talking about the relationship between the Communist Party and the masses here, then to what extent has he丑化 this relationship? To what extent has his hatred for the Party's leadership reached? If this is still a metaphor, referring to certain systems of the Party and the government, such as the confidentiality system, then can we abolish and revoke them all? If it is not a metaphor, but refers to real life, then today some buildings have security equipment, which is indeed to prevent saboteurs. No one can say that there are no saboteurs today. Why does the author want to equate the work of preventing saboteurs in socialist society with the bureaucratic bourgeoisie's prevention of the masses, two fundamentally different things, and draw an equal sign between them? Why is he so agitated and indignant about doing some work to "defend" against "thieves" of socialism?

    The author also uses other metaphors to express the ideal society he yearns for, which is the feudal era, feudal society, and the reclusive life of the literati like Zheng Banqiao and Tao Yuanming, who "wish to see each other's lights" and "call for the last cup across the hedge." The author also says that in Pu Songling's "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," pigs can also enter and exit freely, which is worthy of praise. Because they "have no walls" and all "advocate no walls"! The vanguard of the proletariat, the Communist Party, has always advocated and practiced a simple life, a life of close contact with the masses and mingling with the masses. If the author is referring to these, then naturally it is very good. Unfortunately, he is not like this. In fact, he advocates that all proper boundaries in the relationship between the Party and the masses should be abolished. He praises Cao Xueqin for living on the streets and drinking the northwest wind, which implies this point. If we do things this way according to his meaning, we would not know how there would be Party leadership.

    Rightists curse that the Communist Party has walls, ditches, and outside the walls and ditches, there are also "barbed wire," "moats," and "bridgeheads," etc., and what should be done about it. Some people say to dismantle them, some people say to fill them, but He Feng is dissatisfied with these metaphors. He says that there is a Great Wall that needs to be cried down, and his mood seems even more "sad and solemn"! In fact, as has already been revealed, no matter what they say or what metaphors they use, when it is stripped bare, it is just one sentence: to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party.

### 有人劝人民“哭倒长城”

    有人劝人民“哭倒长城”
    山柏
    6月号的“北京文艺”上登着一篇叫做“漫话”的短文，题目是“墙”（署名何逢）。在这里作者谈天说地，上下古今，仿佛只是想影射地批评共产党员的宗派主义，毫无恶意。可是仔细体会一下，读者就会发现作者实际上是对中国共产党和群众的关系，作了极其片面的估计、阴暗的描写和恶毒的挑拨。
    共产党员的宗派主义思想作风是应该批评、克服的，这种不良习气的确是存在的。有些党员居功自傲，不尊重非共产党人士，缺乏虚心倾听群众意见的党的优良传统习惯，以致在某些工作单位中造成了与群众的隔阂。这种现象严重地损害了工作，违背了党的群众路线。因此，党及时地发起了整风运动，坚决地要求共产党员改正错误。同时，党也指出，非共产党人士也应该消除那种对共产党员采取疏远和猜疑的态度，开诚相见，勇于尽职尽责。
    “墙”的作者在他的文章里所提出来的意见，是不是基本上符合这样的精神呢？不错，作者是在呼吁“拆墙”。可是文章所表露的情绪却是对今天的现实、对党的领导地位、对党和群众之间所应有的关系，有着极大的反感。我们反对党群之间有墙有沟，可是作者在他的文章里没有一言半语肯定党和工人阶级的领导地位，没有一言半语肯定党和群众之间所应该具有的正确的界限，作者也没有一言半语肯定今天党和群众的关系基本上是融洽的。我们的党确实是为群众谋利益的，群众是衷心拥护党的。否定了这些，我们就无法解释我们所完成的每一项工作，无法解释我们在各方面所获得的巨大成绩。作者竟然用极其夸大的比喻，把今天的现实和封建专制皇帝统治的时代拉扯在一块。作者这样说：“……秦始皇就是砌墙专家。……这道墙是凭奴役人民而砌成的，因而秦始皇也就无形中另筑起一道别样的墙——把人民和自己隔离了。孟姜女哭长城，也就出来了。据说，把长城哭倒了，我想这正是人民的愿望——把后一种墙哭倒的吧。”作者甚至还表示，秦始皇的长城还起过保卫作用，因之使后世称道，而后世的墙，则是使人民“鄙夷”的“森严的工事”。
    显然，作者已经被一时“甚嚣尘上”的“拆墙”的论调刺激得脑子发热到了极度，夸张之后再加以夸张。他从墙联想到长城，从长城联想到孟姜女哭倒长城，再联想到秦始皇。他像一个魔法师一样，故意用一连串夸张的联想把一切本质上完全相反的事物搅成一团，使人们分不出青红皂白，似乎共产党和专制统治者并无什么区别！似乎共产党也是奴役人民的！似乎某些工作单位中所存在的党群之间的墙和沟，并不是由于一些党员的宗派主义，而是为了党本身具有奴役人民的性质，因此使自己和人民隔离了，筑起了一道万里长城！这种荒唐的联想和影射只能说是作者对今天现实的歪曲和污蔑，它无益于改进任何工作，只是暴露了作者的阴暗心理和对现实的极度不满甚至仇视。我们要责问作者：难道今天我们的党群之间存在着“孟姜女哭长城”那样的尖锐对立的状态吗？为什么你要做这种挑拨性的煽动呢？我们不能不怀疑你所号召的“众人推，墙倒”，并不是真正要帮助党改善党群关系，拆去妨碍党群关系的“墙”，而是要鼓动人们起来推倒党，推倒党的领导！
    也许有人要说，比喻只是比喻，比喻总是蹩脚的，不能当真。但是，既然这篇文章里独多比喻的文字，那就只有就比喻论比喻了。除了秦始皇造长城这比喻而外，还有几个比喻，其中包括下面这段又像比喻、又不像比喻的话：
    “后世的达官贵人，不但有深宅大院——那当然有上等的墙，而且墙上还插上铁蒺藜；文明的是通上电流。防什么呢？防贼呵。然而谁要是走近这森严的工事的时候，是要投以鄙夷的眼光的。”
    这回在我们面前出现的，总算不再是专制皇帝这个形象了，作者脑子里的精神世界向前发展了一步，变成了官僚资产阶级或者买办资产阶级的社会。如果作者在这里谈的仍然是共产党和人民群众的关系问题，那末，他把这一种关系丑化到了怎样一种程度了呢？他自己对党的领导的仇恨究竟到了什么地步呢？如果这仍是比喻，指的是党和政府的某些制度，例如保密制度，那么我们难道能够一律把它们废止撤销吗？如果不是比喻，是指现实生活，那么今天有些建筑物上有警卫设备，那的确是防破坏分子的。谁也不能说今天已经没有破坏分子。作者为什么要把社会主义社会防破坏分子同官僚资产阶级防人民大众，这两件根本不同性质的事相提并论，在它们之间划一个等号呢？为什么对社会主义社会作一些“防”社会主义之“贼”的工作，要表现得那样激动，那样愤愤不平呢？
    作者还用了另一些比喻，来表明他所向往的理想社会，那就是“愿意和人们灯火相望”，“隔篱呼取尽余杯”的郑板桥、陶渊明等人的封建时代、封建社会和士大夫的隐逸生活。作者还说蒲松龄的
  “聊斋”，猪也可以出出进进，值得赞美。因为他们“没有墙”，都有“不要墙的主张”！无产阶级的先锋队共产党历来都提倡并实行着朴素的生活，密切联系群众、和群众打成一片的生活。如果作者指的是这些，自然很好。可惜他并不是这样。实际上他是主张应该取消党群关系中一切应有的正确界限。他赞美曹雪芹住在街上喝西北风，就暗示了这一点。如果照他的意思这样办，我们就不知怎样会有党的领导了。
    右派分子诅咒着共产党又有墙，有又沟，墙沟之外还有“铁丝网”，还有“护城河”和“桥头堡”等等，应该如何如何。有人说要拆，有人说要填，何逢则不满这些比喻，他说有的是万里长城，需要把它哭倒，其心情显得更加“沉痛悲壮”！实际上，正如已经揭露出来的，不管他们怎么说，怎么打比喻，拆穿了，只一句话，要推翻共产党的领导而已。
