Only People Like Li Jiuwo are "Dejected"
Wuhu Business Community Attacks Internal Bad Elements

(Reported by this newspaper) The Wuhu Municipal Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce held a meeting to refute the anti-socialist remarks made by Li Jiuwo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Wuhu Federation of Industry and Commerce and private deputy director of the Wuhu Soap Factory, a joint state-private enterprise.

Li Jiuwo had made a series of anti-socialist remarks at a forum for businesspeople held by the Municipal United Front Work Department and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. He said: "Now the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature, because the enterprises of the bourgeoisie have already been jointly operated by the state and private sectors, and the capitalists no longer have a selfish material basis. The negative performance of capitalists now cannot be said to be a dual nature." "Now capitalists are dejected because they have no power, and they are downcast because they want to go in a good direction but are not trusted." "We are not learning from workers, but learning from the working class; not learning from Communist Party members, but learning from the Communist Party." Li Jiuwo also said this when the city held its first Federation of Industry and Commerce representative assembly: "When the Japanese ruled China, they implemented the 'Three Alls' policy, and now the Communist Party is also implementing the 'Three Alls' policy."

The meeting criticized Li Jiuwo's remarks. Li Jianping and Wang Chunhui said: After the joint operation, some capitalists failed to perform their duties, refused to obey the leadership of the public side, looked down on workers and even beat and scolded them, haggled over living standards, wasted enterprise funds, isn't this precisely a manifestation of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie? Li Jiuwo's fallacy is a distortion of the facts. Li Jianping and others also pointed out: During the climax of transformation, capitalists welcomed joint operation with gongs and drums, and after the joint operation, many people actively engaged in production and management and won the title of advanced producer. Is this "dejected"? Didn't you see this yourself?

At the meeting, Gong Futing exposed Li Jiuwo's reactionary historical facts, saying: Li Jiuwo had served as a lieutenant colonel, colonel instructor, and battalion commander in Chiang Kai-shek's army. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek ran a training class in Mount Emei, and he also served as an instructor there.

Although Li Jiuwo had run out of arguments, he still refused to admit his guilt and attempted to muddle through with a false self-criticism.

### “垂头丧气”的只是李九我之流  芜湖工商界围击内部败类

    “垂头丧气”的只是李九我之流
    芜湖工商界围击内部败类
    本报讯　芜湖市民主建国会和工商联开会驳倒了这个市的工商联常委、公私合营芜湖肥皂厂私方副厂长李九我的反社会主义言论。
    李九我在市统战部和工商联所召开的工商界人士座谈会上曾发表了一系列的反社会主义言论。他说：“现在资产阶级已经没有两面性了，因为资产阶级的企业已经公私合营，资本家已没有自私自利的物质基础。现在资本家的消极表现不能说是两面性。”“现在资本家都因没有权而丧气，因想往好处走但不被信任而垂头丧气。”“我们不是向工人学习，是向工人阶级学习；不是向共产党员学习，是向共产党学习。”李九我在本市召开第一次工商联代表大会时，还说这样的话：“日本人在中国统治的时候，实行的‘三光’政策，现在共产党也同样实行‘三光’政策”。
    会议对李九我的这些言论作了批驳。李建平和汪春辉说：合营以后，就有一些资本家不能守职尽责，不服从公方的领导，看不起工人甚至打骂工人，计较生活地位，浪费企业资金，不正是资产阶级两面性的表现吗？李九我的谬论是歪曲事实的。李建平等又指出：在改造高潮时期，资本家敲锣打鼓的欢迎合营，合营后许多人积极生产经营，获得了先进生产者的称号，这是“垂头丧气”吗？这难道不是你亲自看到的吗？
    会上，龚辅庭揭发李九我的反动历史事实说：李九我曾在蒋匪军队里做过中校、上校教官和营长等，在抗日战争时期，蒋介石在峨嵋山办一个训练班，他还在那里担任过教官。
    李九我虽然已理屈词尽，但是仍不低头认罪，企图用假检讨蒙混过关。
