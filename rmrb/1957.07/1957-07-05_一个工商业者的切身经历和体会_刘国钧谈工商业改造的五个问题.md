    I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng.

    In the past two months, right-wing elements in the country, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, have viciously attacked the leadership of the Party, attempting to obliterate the achievements made by the Party in leading the people of the whole country in developing production and carrying out the socialist transformation of industry and commerce. Now, I would like to talk about the following issues based on my own experience and feelings.

    Party Representatives Leading Production is Necessary and Has Been Successful

    First, production has developed since liberation, and it is necessary and successful for Party representatives to lead production. I am an industrialist and businessman from Jiangsu Province. Before liberation, the coastal areas were the main markets for imperialist dumping of goods; Jiangsu Province suffered deeply from the scourge of imperialist commodity dumping. At that time, imperialism not only dumped goods in our country, but also exported capital, setting up factories in our country, using our cheap raw materials and labor to exploit our people, and stifle the development of our national industry; at the same time, they manipulated exchange rates, raising or lowering them at any time according to their interests. This was tantamount to strangling the throat of our industry and commerce, and controlling our industry and commerce as a whole. Therefore, before liberation, Jiangsu's industry and commerce had never been able to hold their heads high, and due to the influence of various exchange speculation markets, prices differed in the morning and evening markets. Under the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, honest and patriotic industrialists and businessmen, on the one hand, had all kinds of connections with them, and on the other hand, were trembling and worried about the fate of their careers. Those who were lucky enough to speculate often lost what they had gained through improper means, and the gains were not long-lasting. As for those who unfortunately went bankrupt due to the failure of their industry and commerce, it was commonplace, and some even hanged themselves or jumped into the river. We have fresh memories of these tragic situations. Perhaps some people will say: Since this is the case, why was Jiangsu's industry and commerce relatively developed at that time, and why did the number of spindles in the textile industry develop more than elsewhere? Yes, operating the textile industry in Jiangsu was the most profitable business before liberation. But even taking the textile industry as an example, most of the yarn factories in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai invested and opened by Chinese people before liberation, excluding those invested and opened by imperialism, were losing money, and some even lost so much that their assets could not cover their debts. According to rough calculations, about 90 percent of all yarn factories had been sold or had their old shares discounted and reorganized to recruit new shares. If yarn factories were in such a situation, the situation of other industries and businesses can be imagined.

    The situation after liberation was completely different from that before liberation. First of all, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, the imperialist forces were driven out of the Chinese mainland, and industrialists and businessmen were freed from the fatal scourge of commodity dumping, and were able to concentrate on operating their businesses under the leadership of the Party and the working class. After the establishment of joint state-private ownership of all industries, our country completed the great historical task of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Under the direct leadership of Party representatives, labor productivity has been unprecedentedly improved, output has increased, costs have been reduced, and the achievements are extremely significant. The total industrial output value of Jiangsu Province (excluding handicrafts) in 1949 was 1.05 billion yuan, an increase of 2.2 times compared with 1949, i.e., 3.39 billion yuan. The year 1956 was the year when joint state-private ownership of all industries was realized, and the total industrial output value increased by more than 28 percent compared with 1955. Taking the textile industry as an example again, although the textile industry is a light industry and not a key investment area of the state, the growth of total output value is also very large. In 1949, the total output value of Jiangsu Province's textile industry was 540 million yuan, an increase of 1.6 times compared with 1949, i.e., 1.37 billion yuan, an increase of 20 percent compared with 1955, the year before the establishment of joint state-private ownership of all industries. These examples vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and prove that the leadership of Party representatives in enterprises after the establishment of joint state-private ownership of all industries is necessary and has been successful. Therefore, the recent opinion of right-wing elements to withdraw Party representatives from joint ventures in order to resist the leadership of the Party is obviously absurd.

    The Relationship Between Public and Private Partners is Gradually Improving and Moving Towards Normalcy

    Second, regarding the issue of cooperation between public and private partners. Private industrialists and businessmen all have a set of methods for managing enterprises when they are privately owned. However, most of these methods are unilaterally for the purpose of making profits for the capitalists, and many are not suitable for the actual situation of socialist production, supply, and sales. Therefore, if we want to give play to our business experience and talents, we must first sincerely accept socialist transformation and strengthen our study of the new set of socialist management methods. The prerequisite is to obey the leadership of the Party representatives and the supervision of the working class. Obeying the leadership of the Party representatives is actually obeying the leadership of the Party and the government. In enterprises, whether private personnel hold the position of head or deputy, the principle of obeying the leadership of the Party representatives cannot be shaken. Otherwise, the so-called obedience to the leadership of the Party and the government is just empty talk. As far as I know, if the public and private parties can treat each other with sincerity, raise problems for consultation and research, and on the basis of the general principle of being beneficial to socialist construction and the development of production, argue when necessary and make concessions when necessary, all problems can be solved easily. In Jiangsu, the relationship between public and private partners in larger industries in Wuxi, Changzhou, Nantong and other cities, although not without problems, is basically normal. This is because the larger enterprises account for a larger proportion of the economy, the leadership is more concerned and helps more, the level of Party representatives is chosen to be higher, and the private personnel have more opportunities for education. As for the cooperation between public and private partners in small and medium-sized enterprises, because there are many people and the scope is wide, there are many practical difficulties. The selection of Party representatives has not fully met the needs, so it is relatively worse. However, the cooperation between public and private partners in small and medium-sized enterprises is capable of and is in fact gradually improving and moving towards normalcy.

    The Dual Nature of the Bourgeoisie Cannot Be Denied

    Third, regarding the dual nature of the bourgeoisie. Our national bourgeoisie has a dual nature. On the one hand, before liberation, they suffered a lot and were oppressed and devastated by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, so they have a positive side in accepting socialist transformation and supporting socialism; on the other hand, they are nostalgic for the old system, have strong selfish and profit-seeking thoughts, and are accustomed to the old business methods such as speculation and deception, so they also have a negative side that is not conducive to socialism. Although the positive and negative sides have changed in the eight years since liberation. Generally speaking, after the education and help of the Party and the government and the adoption of a series of utilization, restriction, and transformation measures, especially after the establishment of joint state-private ownership of all industries, the positive side of the bourgeoisie has developed, and the negative factors are gradually decreasing. However, the fact that the bourgeoisie still has a dual nature cannot be denied. Zhang Naiqi said that the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature, which actually means that the bourgeoisie does not need to be transformed. He vainly attempts to please the industrial and commercial circles with this, to sow discord between the industrial and commercial circles and the Party and the government, and to spread his capitalist ideas and anti-Party and anti-socialist toxins. This is precisely the expression of the negative factors of Zhang Naiqi and his few partners. This incident itself has proved how unrealistic and absurd the argument that the bourgeoisie has no dual nature is.

    Shareholders of Dacheng Company Can Recover Their Capital in Two and a Half Years by Receiving Fixed Interest

    Fourth, regarding the redemption policy and fixed interest. Zhang Naiqi said that fixed interest is not exploitation, and Mr. Li Kangnian once suggested paying fixed interest for 20 years. After criticism from various parties, Mr. Li has voluntarily withdrawn this suggestion. However, this also reflects a state of mind of a small number of industrialists and businessmen, which can be regarded as a reflection of negative factors! Many critical articles on the erroneous views of Zhang Naiqi and Li Kangnian have been published, and I don't want to talk much about them. I would like to talk about my own experience.

    The Changzhou Dacheng Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, which I run, started with a capital of 500,000 yuan. Before liberation, the share capital was 2.25 million yuan. After asset inventory and verification, the share capital was calculated at eight times 2.25 million yuan, which is 18 million yuan. Now, the shareholders of Dacheng Company can receive a fixed interest of 900,000 yuan every year, and they can recover the share capital of 2.25 million yuan in two and a half years. And similar situations are not limited to Dacheng alone. We know that the means of production of capitalists are obtained through exploitation, and fixed interest comes from the capital and the equity obtained after asset inventory and verification, which is a child born from the mother, and of course is a kind of exploitation. The government's implementation of the redemption policy for capitalist industry and commerce is not doing business with capitalists. We are very familiar with doing business. Before liberation, there were advertisements for selling and buying in the newspapers every day. Most of the capitalists who sold their factories and stores patted their butts and went out. Secondly, like selling real estate, they had to write a deed of sale, stating that the property was sold and had nothing to do with the seller forever. Our capitalists' means of production are changed from private to public, that is, they become owned by the whole people. We ourselves and our descendants have a share in it. We have not patted our butts and gone out. On the contrary, the government has made appropriate arrangements for private personnel. Some factories and shops had no profit to gain before joint ventures, and even lost money all the time. Now they can still get 5% fixed interest. The capitalist relations of production have changed, and productivity can be greatly improved. We are looking forward to a beautiful socialist and communist society, which is closely related to our own and even our descendants' interests. This means of production is not unrelated to us, which proves that it is not a matter of buying and selling. Taking a step back, let's assume that we are doing business with the Communist Party and the People's Government. Like the situation of Dacheng Company and similar industrial and commercial operators I mentioned above, the seven years of fixed interest we received not only includes all the share capital exploited before liberation, but also includes a large part of the fruits of the hard work of the working class under the leadership of the Party after liberation. Capitalists are all smart at calculating. In the past, when they heard that the fixed interest rate was 5% and the term was seven years, everyone was overjoyed, and they only had the mental preparation to give up the fixed interest in advance. There was no request to extend the term. As for the small number of shareholders who have difficulties and rely on fixed interest income to maintain their lives, the central government has proposed that they can drag a tail and extend the fixed interest time. This extra care is of course more perfect.

    Ideological Remolding is Arduous and Requires Cleansing and Transformation

    Fifth, regarding the issue of ideological remolding. Since the bourgeoisie still has a dual nature and a negative side, of course it is necessary to continue ideological remolding. I believe that since the state has made appropriate arrangements for both the bourgeoisie and the substantive personnel, the future gains and losses of the bourgeoisie, especially the middle and upper class operators, mainly lie not in the amount of fixed interest income and the length of time, but in how to strengthen self-study and transformation in order to better give play to their talents and serve the socialist cause.

    The process of ideological remolding is arduous and tortuous, and my own experience illustrates this point. I was born poor and have participated in labor production and enterprise management for more than 50 years. Due to changes in economic conditions, my own thoughts have also changed, forming a strong bourgeois ideology. I can't forget the frugality and hardship of my early days, and I always thought that doing business was to make profits, and running a factory was to resist dumping. In the early days of liberation, I was very unconvinced when I suddenly heard that industrialists and businessmen made money through exploitation. Later, after the continuous education of the Party and the working class, and through my own ideological struggle, I gradually changed my views in the face of facts. Especially after seeing the changes that have taken place in my own enterprise before and after liberation, many things that I had dreamed of and dared not imagine have been done. I love my career, I see that my career has developed rapidly under the superior socialist system, so I have feelings for the socialist system. However, the socialist revolution is ultimately to eliminate my private property, which cannot but make me uneasy. Until the enterprise I operated and managed became a joint state-private enterprise, my bourgeois thoughts still rose and fell from time to time, and sometimes even stirred up emotions that resisted socialist transformation. Later, on one occasion, I was reminiscing with a fellow villager who had automatically left home with me to find employment. At that time, he learned to be a worker, and I learned to do business. Now, he is a retired old worker, and I am a capitalist. After liberation, although he cannot work, his daughter-in-law supports him by working in the factory, but his life is much better than before, and a son has already graduated from university. He talked about his current life and the beautiful prospects, and his mood was exceptionally cheerful and happy. I sat silently on the side, feeling uneasy and ashamed in my heart. I thought: He and I left our hometown empty-handed. Before liberation, wasn't he frugal and hard-working? No, but his life was harder than mine, because we capitalists exploited their labor wealth. Is such a system reasonable? My life is still much better than his now. Why do I still miss that unreasonable system? That conversation gave me a lot of education and enlightenment. I deeply felt that ideological remolding is arduous, and that it is very pleasant to have ideological remolding and improvement. Because bourgeois thoughts are deeply rooted in our minds, our ideological remolding must get rid of the problems brought about by our capitalist womb before we can replace them with new socialist thoughts. Therefore, the ideological remolding of the bourgeoisie cannot be like acting in a play, changing the head and face, and putting on a set of clothes and thinking that it's over. It is necessary to cleanse and transform. Only in this way can we achieve the elimination of classes and personal happiness; only in this way can we follow the wheels of history, and as self-reliant laborers, closely follow the Party and the working class to socialism and communism, and contribute all our strength to the cause of socialism and communism.

    I have finished speaking.

    一个工商业者的切身经历和体会
    刘国钧谈工商业改造的五个问题
    我完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的报告。
    近两个月来，国内的右派分子，假借帮助党整风的名义，恶毒地攻击党的领导，妄图抹煞党领导全国人民在发展生产和进行工商业社会主义改造方面取得的成就。现在，我想根据我自己的切身经历和体会，谈以下几个问题。
    公股代表领导生产是必要的，有成绩的
    第一，解放后生产是有发展的，公股代表领导生产是必要的、有成绩的。我是江苏省的一个工商业者。解放前，沿海地区是帝国主义倾销商品的主要市场；江苏省蒙受帝国主义商品倾销侵略的祸害，更是创巨痛深。当时帝国主义不仅在我国倾销商品，并输出资本，在我国设立工厂，利用我国的廉价原料和劳动力，剥削我国人民，窒息我国民族工业的发展；同时又操纵汇兑，根据他们的利益，随时提高或压低汇率。这样就等于扼住了我国工商业的咽喉，整个的控制了我国的工商业。因此，在解放以前，江苏的工商业一直没有抬得起头来，而且由于各种交易所投机市场的影响，早晚市价不同，在帝国主义和官僚资本主义的压迫下，正直的、爱国的工商业者一方面固然和他们有着千丝万缕的关系，一方面又莫不战战兢兢、惶惶不可终日地担心着自己事业的命运。幸而投着机的，往往悖入者悖出，得利不长而又失利。至于不幸因经营工商业失败而倾家荡产的，更是司空见惯，有的甚至上吊、投江自杀。这些惨痛景况，我们记忆犹新。也许有人会说：既然如此，为什么当时江苏的工商业还比较发达、而纺织业的纱锭还发展得比别处多呢？是的，解放前在江苏经营纺织业是最为有利的事业。但即以纺织业为例，解放前江苏省和上海的纱厂，除去帝国主义投资开设的不谈，中国人投资开设的纱厂大多数是亏本的，有的甚至亏到资产不能抵偿债务。据粗略计算，在全部纱厂中，曾经有出卖的或将老股打折扣重行改组招收新股的约占百分之九十左右。纱厂尚且如此，其他工商业的境遇就可想而知了。
    解放以后和解放前的情况完全不同了。首先是依靠共产党的领导，把帝国主义势力赶出了中国大陆，工商业者摆脱了商品倾销这一致命的祸害，能够在党和工人阶级的领导下，专心致志地经营自己的事业。全行业公私合营以后，我国完成了私营工商业社会主义改造这一伟大的历史任务，企业在公股代表的直接领导下，劳动生产力获得了空前的提高，产量增加、成本降低，成绩是异常显著的。江苏全省工业总产值（不包括手工业）一九四九年为十亿五千万元，一九五六年较一九四九年增加二点二倍，即三十三亿九千万元。一九五六年是实现全行业公私合营的一年，工业总产值较一九五五年增长百分之二十八之多。如再以纺织工业为例，纺织工业虽然是轻工业，不是国家投资的重点，但生产总值的增长也是很大的。一九四九年江苏全省纺织工业总产值为五亿四千万元，一九五六年较一九四九年增长一点六倍，即十三亿七千万元，较一九五五年即全行业公私合营前一年增长百分之二十。这些事例生动地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，证明了全行业合营以后公股代表对企业的领导是必要的、有成绩的。因此，近来右派分子竟要在合营企业中撤出公股代表，以抗拒党的领导，这种意见显然是异常荒谬的。
     公私共事关系逐步改善和走向正常
    第二，关于公私共事关系问题。私营工商业者在私营时都有经营管理企业的一套办法。但这一套办法中多数是片面的为资方牟取利润，有很多不适合于社会主义社会产供销实际情况的。因此，我们要发挥我们的业务经验和才能，就首先要真诚的接受社会主义改造，加强学习社会主义新的一套经营管理办法，其前提是服从公方代表的领导，服从工人阶级的监督。而服从公方代表的领导，实际上也就是服从党和政府的领导。在企业里，私方人员不论是担任正职或副职，服从公方代表领导这一原则是不能动摇的。否则，所谓服从党和政府的领导就是一句空话。以我所知，公私双方如能推诚相处，有问题提出来协商研究，根据有利于社会主义建设、有利于生产发展这一总的原则，该争论的要争论，该让步的要让步，一切问题是可以迎刃而解的。就江苏来说，无锡、常州、南通等市较大工业中的公私共事关系，虽然不是毫无问题，但基本上是正常的。这是因为大企业所占经济比重较大，领导上关心和帮助多些，公方代表的水平选择得要更高些，私方人员受教育的机会也多些。至于中、小企业公私共事问题，因面广人多，其实际困难也多，在公方代表的人选上未能完全满足需要，因而比较差一些。但是，中、小企业的公私共事关系是能够而事实上也是在逐步改善和走向正常的。资产阶级的两面性不可否认
    第三，关于资产阶级的两面性问题。我们民族资产阶级是有两面性的。一方面在解放以前饱经忧患，遭受过帝国主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和摧残，因而有接受社会主义改造和拥护社会主义的积极的一面；另一方面又留恋旧的制度，有浓厚的自私自利、唯利是图的思想，习惯于投机倒把、尔虞我诈等一套老的经营办法，因而又有其不利于社会主义的消极方面。虽然，积极的一面和消极的一面在解放八年来是有变化的。一般的讲，经过党和政府的教育帮助和采取了一系列的利用、限制、改造的措施，特别是在全行业公私合营以后，资产阶级积极的一面是有发展的，消极因素是在逐步减少的。但是，资产阶级依然存在着两面性却是不可否认的。章乃器说资产阶级没有两面性了，实际上也就是说资产阶级不要改造了。他妄图以此讨好工商界，在工商界和党及政府之间进行挑拨离间，散布他的资本主义思想和反党、反社会主义的毒素。这正是章乃器和他少数伙伴们资产阶级消极因素的发挥。就这一事件本身已经证明资产阶级没有两面性的论点是如何不符合实际情况的无稽之谈了。
    大成公司股东收取定息两年半可以收回股本
    第四，关于赎买政策和定息问题。章乃器说定息不是剥削，李康年先生曾经建议支付定息二十年。以后经过各方面的批判，李先生已自动撤回这一建议了。但是这也反映了少数工商业者的一种思想状态，也可以算作是消极一面因素的反映吧！对于章乃器、李康年这一错误见解的批评文章已经发表了很多，我不想多讲。我还是谈谈我自己的体会。
    我所经营的常州大成纺织印染公司，是以五十万元资本起家的。解放前，股本为二百二十五万元。清产核资后，按二百二十五万元的八倍计算，股本为一千八百万元。现在大成公司股东每年可收定息九十万元，在两年半之中，即可收回二百二十五万元的股本了。而类似这种情况的并不止大成一家。我们晓得，资本家的生产资料是剥削得来的，定息是从资本与清产核资后所取得的股权而来的，是子从母出的，当然是一种剥削。政府执行对资本主义工商业的赎买政策，不是和资本家做买卖。我们对做买卖是很熟悉的，解放前报纸上天天有出盘和受盘的广告，盘出厂店的资方多是拍拍屁股出门，其次像出卖房地产，还要写个绝卖据，说明产业出卖后与卖主永远无涉。我们资本家的生产资料由私有化为公有，即变为全民所有，我们自己和子孙都还有份在内，我们没有拍拍屁股出门，相反的政府对私方人员都作了适当安排，有些工厂、商店在合营前无利可得，甚至一向亏本，现在照样可以拿到五厘定息。资本主义的生产关系改变了，生产力可大大提高了，我们正在期望着一个美好的社会主义、共产主义社会，这和我们自己乃至我们的子孙切身利益攸关，这生产资料不是和我们无涉，这就证明了不是买卖问题。退一步讲，就假设是和共产党、人民政府做买卖罢，像我上面讲的大成公司以及类似大成公司这样工商业者的情况，我们所拿到的七年定息，不仅包括了全部解放前剥削而来的股本，而且还包含着很大一部分解放后党领导工人阶级辛勤劳动的成果。工商业者的算盘都是精明的，以前听到一律定息五厘以及期限七年的时候，大家都喜出望外，只有提前放弃定息的思想准备，那有延长期限的要求呢。至于少数困难股东依靠定息收入维持生活的，中央已经提出可以拖个尾巴，延长定息时间，这种额外照顾当然更是完善了。
    思想改造是艰苦的需要洗心涤腑、脱胎换骨
    第五，关于思想改造问题。资产阶级既然还存在两面性，还有消极的一面，当然就要继续进行思想改造。我以为，由于国家对资产阶级和实职人员都已作了适当安排，因而对于资产阶级特别是中上业户来说，其前途、得失，主要的已不在于定息收入的多少和时间的长短，而在于如何加强自我学习和改造，以更好发挥自己的才能，为社会主义事业服务。
    思想改造的过程是艰苦曲折的，我自己的经验就说明了这一点。我出身清寒，参加劳动生产和企业管理五十余年。由于经济状况的改变，自己的思想也有了改变，形成了浓厚的资产阶级思想。我对于自己创业时的勤俭朴素、含苦茹辛耿耿难忘，总以为做生意是将本求利，办工厂是抵制倾销，在解放初期时，骤然听说工商业者赚钱是剥削还很不服气。后来经过党和工人阶级的不断教育，通过自己的思想斗争，我在事实面前逐步改变了自己的观点。尤其是看到自己企业在解放前后所起的变化，许多以前我梦寐以求的和不敢想像的事情都办到了。我爱我的事业，我看到我的事业在优越的社会主义制度下有了飞速的发展，因而我对社会主义制度也就发生了感情。但是，社会主义革命到底是要革掉我的私有财产，这又不能不使我心悸，直到我所经营管理的企业公私合营以前，我的资产阶级思想还是时起时伏，有时甚至蠢蠢欲动，产生对抗社会主义改造的情绪。后来有一次，我和一个和我一起自动离家就业的同乡叙旧，当时他学做工，我学经商。现在，他乃是一个退休的老年工人，而我却是一个资本家了。解放后，他虽不能做工，由儿媳在厂做工供养他，但他的生活比以前好得多了，且有一个儿子已在大学毕业，他谈到现在的生活，谈到美好的远景，心情异常开朗和愉快。而我闷坐一旁，内心感到不安和惭愧。我想：我和他一样是赤手空拳离开家乡的，解放前，他不勤俭朴素、未含苦茹辛吗？不是，但他的生活比我苦，是因为我们资本家剥削了他们的劳动财富，这样的制度合理吗？我现在生活还是比他好得很多，为什么我还要留恋那不合理的制度呢？那次的谈话给我的教育和启发很大。我深深感觉到思想改造是艰苦的，而思想得到了改造、有了提高又是很愉快的。由于资产阶级思想在我们的头脑中根深蒂固，我们的思想改造，必须脱去资本主义胎里带来的毛病，才能换进社会主义的新思想。因而资产阶级的思想改造不能像演戏一样的改头换面，罩上一套行装就算了事，而是要洗心涤肺、脱胎换骨的改造。只有这样，才能做到阶级消灭，个人愉快；只有这样，我们才能跟着历史的车轮前进，作为自食其力的劳动者，紧紧地跟着党和工人阶级走向社会主义、共产主义，并为社会主义、共产主义事业贡献出我们的一切力量。
    我的话完了。
