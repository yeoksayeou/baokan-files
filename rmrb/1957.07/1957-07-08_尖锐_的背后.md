Behind the "Sharpness"
　　
Xin Wei'ai

　　In Chinese chess, next to the "General" or "King" are the "Advisor" and "Elephant". Coming up with ideas, finding solutions, drafting manifestos, speaking eloquently – these should be the specialties of the "Advisor." He can't cook, but he can start a fire; he can't farm, but he can sow discord; he can't operate a machine, but he can wave a feather fan. Before things are even started, or when they have begun but the outcome is still unclear, he can move people's hearts with his sweet talk and attract a few listeners. Turgenev's Rudin was originally a "superfluous man" who accomplished nothing. Yet, when he first appeared in the drawing room of Mariya Mikhailovna's villa, he suppressed a cynical skeptic with just a few words; he made the tutor admire him so much that he was utterly devoted, his eyes constantly fixed on him, listening to see if he would utter any aphorisms or witty remarks; the innocent Natasha was also confused by him and even alienated the person who loved her.

　　Thus, those who consider themselves more talented than Rudin really believe that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders. He is Zeus, he is a Titan. With a point of his left hand, he can immediately summon swift winds and heavy rain; with a wave of his right hand, he can instantly move mountains and overturn seas.

　　Gorky, in his novel "The Life of Klim Samgin," inserted such a metaphor: a fly perched on the horn of an ox, following the ox to the field. When the ox returned, the fly exclaimed triumphantly, "I've come back from plowing!"

　　The fly still had to perch on the ox's horn to have this idea. But some gentlemen and scholars will have such fantastic thoughts even when they have nothing to rely on under their feet. What does the working class count for? Knowledge is what we disseminate. What is so great about Marxism-Leninism? It's nothing more than a few black characters on white paper…

　　They believe that only by having this kind of spirit can one be considered a "left-wing intellectual." In Wenhui Daily, an article published in the form of a "letter to the editor" stated: Today, the vast majority of us intellectuals are willing to get close to the Party, follow the Party, and be left-wing intellectuals. The problem is: how should we understand the meaning of the word "left-wing" today? In order to expose the contradictions within the people, … many people have opened their mouths and expressed their long-repressed feelings. Many opinions are indeed unprecedented and unmentionable. … If we categorize people into left, center, and right, this should undoubtedly be the left. … But some people say that those with sharp opinions are right-wing, and those who can refute sharp opinions are left-wing. If that is really the case, then those who "contend" and "bloom" will have to be apprehensive: sharpness is not as good as stability, and stability is not as good as silence. The result is: contradictions stop being exposed, and rectification loses its meaning.

　　The original text is even longer; here, only the most important sentences are collected.

　　How he understands "getting close to the Party" and "following the Party" is further elaborated below, which will be left aside for now. According to the meaning of the article, it seems that the "meaning" of "left-wing" is "sharp opinions," is "unprecedented." He disagrees with people classifying "sharp opinions" as "right-wing," and he also opposes people refuting these "sharp opinions." He believes that refuting them is "right-wing." The "meaning" of "left" and "right" factions is actually so simple, which is quite novel.

　　Being able to have "sharp opinions" and being able to "say what others have not said" is not necessarily a bad thing. But what is the "way" being "said" that has not been fully "said"? What is the "word" being "spoken" that has not been fully "spoken"? Is it Marxism-Leninism or the fallacy of the "Party-dominated world" that opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat? Is it helping the rectification or sabotaging the rectification, opposing the Party, and opposing socialism?

　　The author of the "letter" did not directly state these "ways," but he explained it very clearly in his later text. He said that distinguishing between the three factions of people cannot be separated from specific historical conditions. In the past, when fighting the enemy, we unconditionally followed the Party; today, when dealing with contradictions among the people, we must take a clear stand, distinguish right from wrong, and not be ambiguous.

　　In the past, because of the "specific historical conditions" of the past, we "unconditionally followed the Party." Today, according to the "specific historical conditions" of today, we cannot "unconditionally follow." We "must" have a "clear attitude" and "distinguish right from wrong." Look, here he is trying to gently push down the leadership of the Communist Party with a single stroke; to gently turn the great rights of the Communist Party into wrongs, and the great wrongs of the bourgeois rightists into rights. He still wants to call himself a "left-wing" intellectual. This is this kind of person's tongue-in-cheek statement about getting close to the Party, which is consistent with Zhang Bojun's line.

　　Defeating Chiang Kai-shek and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat should be considered a transformation of "specific historical conditions," right? Carrying out socialist transformation and eliminating capitalism should also be considered a transformation of "specific historical conditions," right? After experiencing such a transformation, shouldn't we follow the Party even more closely? What kind of "specific historical conditions" are there today that allow us to talk about "right" and "wrong" without the Party? Is it that the Communist Party is "losing ground"? Is it that Marxism-Leninism is outdated? Is it that people like Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping have "come to power"?

　　Only flies perched on the horns of oxen, only those who are fed and raised by the blood of the people, hope every day that "specific historical conditions" can be transformed according to their wishes, hoping day and night for the sky to change.

### “尖锐”的背后

    “尖锐”的背后
    辛未艾
    在象棋中，紧挨着“将”、“帅”的是“士”、“相”。出主意，想办法，草檄作文，侃侃而谈，这该是“士”的专长。他不会做菜，但是会点火；他不会种田，但是会播弄是非；他不会开机器，但是会摇羽扇。在事情还没有动手做，或者已经开手做、还不能看出苗头来的时候，他会用娓娓动听的话打动人们的心，吸引几个听众。屠格涅夫的罗亭，原是一个一事无成的“多余的人”。然而当他刚刚在玛里雅·米哈伊洛芙娜的别墅的客厅里露头角的时候，没有几句话，就把一个善于挖苦人的怀疑主义者压了下去；使那个家庭教师钦佩得五体投地：眼睛老是盯着他看，听着，对方有没有发出警句隽语来；那个天真无邪的那塔莎也为他而迷惘起来，竟把热爱着她的人也疏远了。
    于是自认为才能超过罗亭的人，就真的以为天下的兴亡都系于他一身了。他是宙士，他是泰坦。他的左手一指，马上会起迅风急雨；他的右手一挥，立刻能移山倒海。
    高尔基在长篇小说“克里·萨木金的一生”中，插叙过这样一个比喻：有一只苍蝇，蹲在牛角上，跟着牛下田去。当牛回来的时候，苍蝇就得意洋洋的叫道：“我耕田回来啦！”
    苍蝇还是蹲在牛角之上，才有这种想法。但是有一些士君子们就在脚下毫无什么凭倚的时候，也会有这种奇想。工人阶级算得什么，知识就是我们传播的；马克思列宁主义又有什么了不起，无非是白纸上几个黑字……
    他们认为，要有这种气魄，才算是“左派知识分子”。文汇报上，有一篇以“读者投书”的形式发表的文章，就这样说过：在今天，我们知识分子，绝大多数都愿意靠拢党，跟着党走，做个左派的知识分子，问题就在于：今天应该如何去理解左派二字的涵义。为了揭露人民内部的矛盾，……许多人都开口了，把积压多时的衷曲吐露出来，有不少意见，确是道人所未道，言人所不敢言。……如果以左、中、右三派论人，这应该是左派无疑。……但也有人说，意见尖锐的是右派，能够反驳尖锐意见的是左派，如果真的这样，那么“鸣”“放”者就要心虚了：尖锐不如平稳，平稳不如缄默，其结果是：矛盾停止揭露，整风失去意义。
    原文还要长些，这里只把最紧要的文句集纳起来。
    关于“靠拢党”、“跟着党走”他是怎样理解的问题，下文他还另有发挥，这里姑且存而不论。看文章的意思，好像“左派”的“涵义”，就是“意见尖锐”，就是“道人所未道”。他不同意人家把“意见尖锐”列作“右派”，他也反对人们去反驳这些“尖锐的意见”。他认为，反驳了才是“右派”。“左”“右”派的“涵义”，居然如此简单，这倒是十分新奇的。    能够“意见尖锐”，能够“道人所未道”，说来也并非坏事。但是“道”的是什么未尽之“道”呢？“言”的是什么未尽之“言”呢？是马克思列宁主义还是反对无产阶级专政的“党天下”谬论？是帮助整风还是破坏整风反对党，反对社会主义？
    “投书”作者没有正面说出这些“道”，但是他的后文却讲得很明白，他说分辨三派人物，不能离开特定的历史条件，在过去，对敌人斗争，我们是毫无条件地跟着党走；在今天，处理人民内部矛盾，我们就必须以鲜明的态度，分清是非，不能含糊其辞。
    过去由于过去的“特定历史条件”，才“无条件跟着党走”，今天根据今天的“特定历史条件”，不能“无条件跟着走”了“必须”“态度鲜明”、“分清是非”请看，他在这里硬是想轻轻一笔就把共产党的领导推倒；轻轻一笔就把共产党的大是变成非，把资产阶级右派的大非变成是。他还要自命为“左派”知识分子。这就是这种人关于靠拢党的舌底藏刀的说法，同章罗一脉相承。
    打垮蒋介石，到建立无产阶级专政，这应该算是“特定历史条件”的转变吧；进行社会主义改造，消灭资本主义，这也应该算是“特定历史条件”的转变吧。经历这样的转变以后，我们不是应该更加亲密无间地跟着党走吗？今天究竟有些什么样的“特定历史条件”，可以离开了党而谈“是”“非”了呢？是共产党“大势已去”吗？是马克思列宁主义过时了吗？是章伯钧、储安平之流“上台”了吗？
    只有蹲在牛角上的苍蝇，只有依靠人民的血而哺养长大的人，才天天希望“特定历史条件”能够按照他们的心意转变，日日夜夜希望天变。
