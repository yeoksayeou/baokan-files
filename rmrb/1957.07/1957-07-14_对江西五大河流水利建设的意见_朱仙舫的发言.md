In this preparatory meeting, I studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and I deeply feel that it is a bright light illuminating the victory of the people across the country. After listening to the reports of Premier Zhou and others, they all pointed out the specific direction for our continued progress in a spirit of seeking truth from facts. I completely agree and wholeheartedly support them. In the past few years, great plans have been transformed into reality and appeared before our eyes, making people feel infinitely excited and encouraged. The United Nations World Economic Report also truthfully pointed out that my country's industrial production growth rate last year topped the world. However, right-wing elements took advantage of the Party's rectification to exaggerate shortcomings, obliterate achievements, fabricate facts, and deliberately slander; they should know that facts speak louder than words and are just a waste of time for mediocre people. We are determined to draw a clear political and ideological line between ourselves and them and carry out necessary struggles against them. We believe that after this rectification, the unity of the people across the country will become even stronger, and their strength for socialist construction and socialist transformation will be greatly increased.

Now I would like to talk about the water conservancy issue for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture:

To transform our backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country and gradually improve people's lives while carrying out construction, we must strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture. Only then will light industry have sufficient raw materials and heavy industry have a reliable market. Therefore, we must do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture to supply the vast people with the means of subsistence and production materials, and only then can we have a practical guarantee.

However, there are many ways to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, such as intensive cultivation, selection of seeds and dense planting, pest control and fertilizer accumulation, agricultural technology, etc. Especially important is how to do a good job in water conservancy issues such as flood control, drainage, and drought resistance, which are deeply and greatly related to agricultural production. If water conservancy is done well, then farmers will be rewarded with a good harvest or a bumper harvest for their labor. If the fields are flooded or suffer from severe drought, then the hard work of the farmers will be in vain. What is more heartbreaking than this? Moreover, when studying water conservancy issues, we must never start from a one-sided perspective, but must have an overall plan and comprehensively consider the local situation, water flow system, rainfall amount, drainage width, etc., in order to avoid taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, and causing new contradictions.

In late April this year, I went to the rural areas of Ruichang County for inspection and personally experienced the importance of water conservancy issues to agricultural production. I have already submitted a special report on my inspections to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee for handling. There are still larger water conservancy issues that cannot be handled by Jiangxi's manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and must be planned by the relevant central departments. I will briefly describe them below.

Our province is located in the southeastern part of the country, on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It has five major rivers, namely the Gan, Fu, Rao, Xiu, and Xin rivers, and dozens of tributaries. The water sources originate from the mountainous areas in the southeast, west, and then flow through the hills to the northern plains, converging in Poyang Lake and entering the Yangtze River from Hukou.

The province covers an area of approximately 168,580 square kilometers, with more than 41.4 million mu of cultivated land, including more than 35 million mu of rice paddies. The climate is mild and the rainfall is abundant. Most areas have two harvests a year, making it a major rice-producing area in our country. At the same time, there are many high mountains and peaks, and water resources are very abundant. There are also large amounts of common and some rare minerals, large tracts of forests and virgin forests, which can provide a broad development for industry.

However, due to the uneven distribution of rainfall, the rainfall from April to June each year accounts for about half of the total. From July to September, the rainfall is less and the evaporation is greater, so floods and waterlogging are often caused in the spring and summer seasons, and drought disasters are caused in the autumn. Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the active efforts of the masses, small and medium-sized water conservancy projects have been built, basically ensuring the safety of many farmlands and important industrial cities and railway transportation in the lower reaches of each river and the lakeside area, and increasing and improving the irrigation area by more than 24 million mu. However, this is only some local work to eliminate frequent water and drought disasters, and it is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, the grain production reduced by water and drought disasters each year averages more than 800 million jin, which has imposed certain restrictions on agricultural production in our province.

With the realization of agricultural cooperativization and the development of socialist industrial construction in the province, water conservancy construction is no longer just a matter of local disaster relief, but must adopt a policy of combining temporary and permanent solutions, comprehensively develop water resources, make an overall plan for each river basin, and implement it regularly, in order to fundamentally eliminate water and drought disasters and fully develop the comprehensive water conservancy. The preliminary opinions on the water conservancy of the five major rivers of Gan, Fu, Rao, Xiu, and Xin are described below:

1.  Gan River Basin: The Gan River is the largest river in our province, originating from the Zhang and Gong rivers, flowing through the entire province, with a length of 7,300 kilometers and a basin of 83,000 square kilometers, accounting for more than half of the province's area. Agricultural production accounts for more than half of the province's total. The average annual water inflow into the lake is 74.77 billion cubic meters, which is about 1.5 times the water inflow of the Yellow River into the sea. The upper reaches of the river have steep slopes and abundant water power. The tungsten mines in southern Jiangxi are famous all over the world. In the future, large-scale mining will require more and more power. In the case of a lack of coal in southern Jiangxi, the development of water resources is one of the important tasks of our country's socialist construction. The river is also the main artery of our province, and the exchange of materials in the area is mainly based on water transportation. The navigable mileage reaches 2,000 kilometers, but there are many dangerous shoals near Wan'an, and the middle and lower reaches of the river are often troubled by shallow water and difficult navigation.

    In short, the comprehensive development of the Gan River basin should focus on flood control, drainage, drought resistance, hydropower development, improvement of navigation and soil and water conservation. Therefore, surveying and mapping appropriate areas and building a number of comprehensive reservoirs, such as Zhulanbu, Maodian, Wan'an, and Xiajiang, can install approximately 1.1 million kilowatts of hydroelectric generators.

2.  Fu River Basin: The Fu River is located in the southeastern part of our province, with a basin of 18,400 square kilometers, including approximately 6 million mu of cultivated land, which is one of the main rice-producing areas in our province. These farmlands are in mountain streams. The upper reaches are often subject to mountain floods and droughts, while the lower reaches are subject to severe floods and waterlogging. The transportation in the basin is relatively developed, with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passing through the northern part of the basin to the plains. Therefore, the development of the Fu River should focus on flood control, drainage, irrigation, hydropower generation, improvement of navigation, and soil and water conservation. Therefore, two reservoirs should be built on the main stream of the Fu River, namely the Shibi Tou in Nanfeng and the Liao Fang in Jinxi, and three reservoirs should be built on the tributaries, namely the Tangjie in the Litan River, the Lutang in the Yihuang River, and the Bashan in the Chongren River, which can install more than 100,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric generators.

3.  Rao River Basin: The Rao River is located in the northeastern part of our province, and is the general name of the Chang River and the Le'an River. The basin area is 15,500 square kilometers. The downstream lakeside area has fertile soil and is one of the main areas for grain, cotton, and fishery production in our province. The middle reaches produce coal, manganese, lead, zinc, and other minerals. Jingdezhen's porcelain industry is famous at home and abroad. Therefore, the comprehensive development of the Rao River basin should focus on meeting the drainage and irrigation power required by industry and agriculture, combined with regulating the flow, reducing flood peaks, reducing floods, and improving waterways. According to preliminary surveys, one Zhangshukeng Reservoir is to be built, and the Huangbaiyuan, Zhongjiashan, and Xinying reservoirs on the Le'an River can install more than 100,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric generators.

4.  Xiu River Basin: The Xiu River is located in the northwestern part of our province, with a basin area of 14,600 square kilometers and 2.8 million mu of cultivated land. Agricultural production is mainly grain, followed by black tea and timber. Along the river, there are continuous mountains and steep ridges, concentrated rainstorms, and alternating valleys and small basins. There are many hydropower sites and it is close to Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Poyang Lake. Therefore, the fundamental solution to water hazards and the development of the Xiu River should focus on building reservoirs, developing hydropower, supplying agricultural drainage and irrigation, supporting industry, reducing flood and drought disasters, and improving waterways. According to preliminary surveys, the Monkey Cliff on the main stream of the Xiu River is a water conservancy hub. Building a reservoir here can install 150,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric generators. Building reservoirs in a series of tributaries can also install more than 100,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric generators.

5.  Xin River Basin: The Xin River is located in the eastern part of our province, with a basin area of 16,700 square kilometers. The middle and upper reaches are densely covered with mountains and hills, and the lower reaches are alluvial plains, close to Poyang Lake. There are many tributaries on the left bank. Therefore, the comprehensive development of the Xin River basin should focus on farmland flood control and irrigation, and the development of hydroelectric power, followed by improving downstream waterways and soil and water conservation work. Therefore, the preliminary opinion on governing the river is to build the Huangshagang Reservoir, which controls 8,700 square kilometers of the Xin River, accounting for more than half of the area. It can ensure the safety of 600,000 mu of farmland, improve navigation, and install 50,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric generators.

The above is the basic situation of each river basin in our province. We must quickly formulate a policy of combining temporary and permanent solutions. If we plan and implement it, the floods and waterlogging in spring and summer and the drought disasters in autumn may be basically eliminated, and agricultural harvests can be controlled by ourselves. The ancient proverb of "relying on heaven for food" will also become a historical term. At the same time, the water discharged from the reservoir will be clear, the riverbed will gradually deepen, and the river channel will become more stable. Navigation will naturally improve, and transportation will be more convenient. In particular, each region will obtain permanent and cheap hydropower, which can not only be used for drainage and irrigation, but also drive some processing machines, and can also be used for lighting and modern medical and entertainment needs, and can also supply a large amount of electricity to nearby industrial and mining areas. Building a chemical fertilizer plant will solve the urgent needs of farmers.

Some people ask about the ratio of hydropower construction costs to thermal power construction costs? This is worth considering. First of all, it depends on the water resources, and secondly, it depends on the geology of the reservoir construction. If these conditions are good, the hydropower construction costs will not be more than the thermal power construction costs, and sometimes they may be equal (our country has a lot of manpower and low wages, and the geology is mostly hard rock). In terms of regular expenses, hydropower is generally only one-sixth to one-seventh of thermal power. According to general estimates, hydropower construction investment can be fully recovered in only three or four years. Furthermore, the rapid progress of hydropower equipment in our country in recent years is also amazing. 3,000 kilowatts, 15,000 kilowatts, and 72,000 kilowatts can already be manufactured, and 100,000 kilowatts will be manufactured soon. It is extremely convenient that the complete set of equipment for hydropower stations can be manufactured domestically. Therefore, these reservoir projects will bring endless happiness to the local farmers and bring very favorable conditions for the development of industrial, agricultural construction and transportation in our country. We earnestly hope that relevant central departments will give strong support in all aspects, conduct comprehensive planning according to the current situation, allocate funds, distinguish between priorities, and implement them as scheduled. Then, after a few years, we will be able to gradually turn rural areas into cities, eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas, and promote the realization of socialist construction.

    对江西五大河流水利建设的意见
    朱仙舫的发言
    这次预备会学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，我深深地感到这是照耀全国人民胜利的明灯。听了周总理及其他各位的报告，都是本着实事求是的精神，指出我们继续前进的具体方针，我完全同意并衷心拥护。几年来，伟大的计划都能变成事实，出现于眼前，令人感到无限兴奋和鼓舞。联合国世界经济报也据实指出，我国去年工业增产速度冠全球。而右派分子利用党整风的机会，夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，捏造事实，存心诽谤；须知事实胜于雄辩，徒属庸人自扰。我们坚决要和他们划清政治上、思想上的界限，并对他们进行必要的斗争，我们相信，经过这次整风后，全国人民的团结必更强大起来，对社会主义的建设和社会主义的改造，必更增加无比的力量。
    现在我就农业争取大丰收的水利问题来谈一下：
    我们要使落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，并在进行建设的同时，逐步地改善人民生活，必须争取农业大丰收，而后轻工业才有足够的原料，重工业才有可靠的市场。因此，供应广大人民的生活资料和生产资料，都须千方百计争取农业大丰收，而后才有切实的保证。
    但争取农业大丰收的方法甚多，如精耕细作、选种密植、防虫积肥、农业技术等等。尤其要者，则为如何搞好防洪、排涝、抗旱的水利问题，关系农业生产，至深且巨，如果水利搞得好，则农民出了劳动，就有丰收或大丰收的报酬，如田地被水淹没或遭大旱，则农民胼手胝足，辛勤劳动，即同白费，伤心的事，孰甚于此。且研究水利问题，千万不可从片面出发，须有整体规划，综合当地形势，水流系统，雨量大小，排泄宽窄等统筹而熟计之，才可避免顾此失彼，矛盾重生。
    今年四月下旬，我至瑞昌县农村视察，亲自体验到水利问题与农业生产的重要性，已将视察所及，专案报告江西省人民委员会处理。尚有较大的水利问题，非江西人力、物力、财力所能举办，必须仰中央有关部门进行规划者，略述于后。
    我省位全国东南部，长江中下游的南岸，境内有赣、抚、饶、修、信等五大河和数十条支流，水源分别出于东南西山岭地区，经丘陵而至北部平原汇流于鄱阳，由湖口而入长江。
    全省面积约十六万八千五百八十平方公里，耕田四千一百四十余万亩，其中水稻三千五百余万亩，气候温和，雨量充沛，大部地区，每年两熟，为我国主要产米地区，同时境内多高山峻岭，水力资源非常丰富，并有大量的和一些稀有的矿藏，大片的森林和原始森林，足供工业方面的广阔发展。
    但因雨量分配不匀，每年四月至六月降雨量约占一半，七月至九月雨量既少，蒸发量又大，故经常造成春夏两季的洪涝和秋季的旱灾。解放以来，由于党政的正确领导和群众的积极努力，修了中小型水利，基本上保障了各河下游及湖滨许多农田和重要工业、城市和铁路交通的安全，增加和改善灌溉面积二千四百余万亩，然此不过为消除常遭水旱灾害的若干局部工作，并非根本之图。所以每年因水、旱灾害减产的粮食，平均约有八亿余斤之多，对于我省农业生产受到一定的限制。
    随着全省农业合作化的实现，社会主义工业建设的发展，水利建设已不仅是局部除害的问题，而必须采取治标治本相结合的方针，对水利资源进行综合开发，作出各河流域的整体规划，定期实施，从根本上消灭水旱灾害和充分开发综合水利的目的。现将赣、抚、饶、修、信五大河流的水利初步意见，分述如下：
    1．赣江流域：赣江为我省第一大河，源出章、贡二水，流贯全省，流长七千三百公里，流域八万三千平方公里，占全省面积二分之一强，农产量占全省半数以上，全年入湖水量平均达七百四十七点七亿公方，约等黄河入海水量一点五倍。其上游河床坡降陡峻，水力丰富，赣南钨矿，驰名世界，将来大量开采，需要动力日多，在赣南煤炭缺乏的情况下，水力资源的开发，是我国社会主义建设重要任务之一，该江又是我省大动脉，区内物资交流，大部以水运为主，通航里程达二千公里，惟万安附近，滩险甚多，中下游河道，每苦水浅难航。
    总之赣江流域综合开发对象，应以防洪、排涝、抗旱、开发水电、改善航运及保持水土。因此，勘测适当地区，建设若干综合性水库，如珠兰埠，茅店，万安，峡江等，共可安装水力发电机一百一十万瓩左右。
    2．抚河流域：抚河位于我省东南部，流域一万八千四百平方公里，其中耕地约六百万亩，为我省主要产米地区之一，这些农田在山溪中，上游常遭山洪和旱灾，下游则受严重的洪涝灾害，流域交通比较发达，有浙赣铁路经流域北部而至平原。因此，抚河的开发的对象，应以防洪、排涝、灌溉、水力发电、改善航运及水土保持，故于抚河主流建筑水库两个，即南丰的石壁头，金溪的廖坊，支流建筑水库三个，即黎滩水的塘街，宜黄水的鹿塘，崇仁水的巴山，共可安装水力发电机十万瓩以上。
    3．饶河流域：饶河位于我省东北部，为昌江、乐安两河之总称，流域面积一万五千五百平方公里，下游滨湖地区，土壤肥沃，为我省粮、棉、渔业生产主要地区之一。中游产煤、锰、铅、锌等矿，景德镇之瓷业，驰名中外，故饶河流域的综合开发，应以适应工矿业及农业所需排灌动力为主，结合调节流量，降低洪峰，减轻水患，改善航道。据初步调查，建筑樟树坑水库一个，乐安河的黄柏垣、仲家山、新营等水库，共可安装十万多瓩的水力发电机。
    4．修河流域：修河位于我省西北部，流域面积一万四千六百平方公里，耕地二百八十万亩，农产以粮食为主，红茶、木材次之。沿河丛山峻岭，暴雨集中，峡谷和小盆地相间，水力地段甚多，且距九江、南昌及鄱阳湖较近。因此，根治水害与开发修河，应以建筑水库、发展水电、供给农业排灌及支援工业并减免洪涝旱灾，改善航道为主。据初步调查，修河主流猴子崖，是水利枢纽，在此建筑水库，可以安装十五万瓩水力发电机，再在支流一系列中，兴建水库，又可安装十万瓩以上的水力发电机。
    5．信河流域：信河位于我省东部，流域面积一万六千七百平方公里，中上游山丘密布，下游为冲积平原，且滨近鄱阳湖，支流多在左岸，故信河流域综合开发的对象，应以农田防洪灌溉、开发水力电为主，次为改善下游航道及水土保持工作。故治理该河初步的意见是：兴建黄沙港水库，控制信河面积八千七百平方公里，占面积一半以上，可以保障六十万亩农田的安全，还可改善航运，安装五万瓩水力发电机。
    以上是我省各河流域的基本情况，从速作出治标治本的方针。进行规划实施，则春夏洪涝、秋季旱灾，可能基本消除，农业丰收，能自掌握，而靠天吃饭的古谚，也将成为过去历史的名词。同时水库下泄的水必清，河床日渐涮深，河漕日趋稳定，航运自随改善，交通必更便利，尤使各地区获得永久廉价的水电，不仅借以排涝灌溉，还可拖动一些加工机器，又能利用照明及近代医疗文娱之需，更能供给附近工矿大量电力要求，兴建化学肥料厂，解决农民迫切之需。
    有人问水电建设费和火电建设费的比例如何？这是值得大家考虑的。首先要看水力资源，其次要看修建水库的地质，如果这些条件都好，水电建设费不会比火电建设费过多，有时还可相等（我国人工多，而工资廉，地质多系硬石），若就经常费用来说，则水电比火电，普通仅合六分之一至七分之一，据一般估计，水电建设投资，只须三、四年间，即可全部收回，更就水电设备来说，我国近年突飞猛进，又属惊人，三千瓩、一万五千瓩、七万二千瓩已能制造，不久将制十万瓩，水电站的全套设备，既能自造，实属莫大便利。因此，这些水库工程将给各当地农民带来无穷的幸福，并给我国工业、农业建设和交通运输发展带来非常有利的条件。切盼中央有关部门，从各方面给以大力支持，按照当前情况，进行综合规划，拨定款项，分别缓急，如期实施，则若干年后，必能使农村逐渐变成都市，消灭城乡区别，而促进社会主义建设的实现。
