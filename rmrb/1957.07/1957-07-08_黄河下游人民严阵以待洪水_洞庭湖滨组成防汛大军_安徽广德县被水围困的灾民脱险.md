Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th. Heavy rain fell in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River on the 6th, with some areas experiencing moderate to heavy rain, indicating the potential for flooding in the Yellow River. The downstream areas are now displaying a busy scene of high alert for floods. Currently, flood control organizations have been established in Henan and Shandong provinces along the lower reaches of the Yellow River, as well as in various special districts and counties. Flood control organizations at the township and cooperative levels have also been largely established. Henan Province has made early arrangements and rapid progress in flood control work, and has already formed a flood control team of nearly 200,000 people. Party and government leading bodies at all levels along the river have conducted thorough research and arrangements regarding the combination of flood control and production, as well as the issue of work point distribution and dividends for agricultural cooperative members participating in flood control. In the spirit of rectifying and improving work while carrying out the rectification campaign, cadres at all levels have gone deep to inspect and assist work. The person in charge of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters and the vice governors of Henan and Shandong provinces have also led flood control inspection groups to conduct on-site inspections of flood control preparations along the Yellow River. The flood control materials needed in various places have either been prepared or are being repaired or supplemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th. Farmers in the Dongting Lake area, known as the "Granary of Hunan," have made preparations for flood control before the river rises.

According to the person in charge of the Hunan Provincial Flood Control Headquarters: By the end of June, flood control command organizations had been established in various special districts and counties. Incomplete statistics from the Changde and Xiangtan special districts in the lakeside area show that more than 290,000 people have been organized into flood control teams.

This year, the preparation of flood control materials in the lake area is more substantial than last year. The state has allocated 800,000 yuan for flood control funds and 4 million catties of flood control rations to the Dongting Lake area.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th. More than 4,500 disaster victims recently surrounded by floods in Guangde County, Anhui Province, have all escaped danger due to timely rescue.

From the 2nd to the 4th, Guangde County experienced continuous heavy rain of 319 millimeters, and mountain torrents broke out. Due to the excessive water volume, the floodwaters overflowed the riverbanks, causing a disaster. On the afternoon of the 2nd, 37 villages were surrounded by floods. In order to ensure the timely escape of more than 4,500 disaster victims surrounded by water, the Guangde County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately dispatched more than 400 cadres, led by responsible cadres of the county committee, to carry out rescue operations in all directions. Zhan Lijun, deputy director of the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department, rowed a small boat to Daba Village on the night of the 2nd and rescued 51 disaster victims standing on the roof. Chen Shuchun, director of the County Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department, and Hu Jinbao, member of the County Party Committee, led cadres to promptly transfer more than 1,200 disaster victims surrounded by water in Gangdong and other seven villages to a safe area by boat. In this tense rescue, Liu Gaosheng, a staff member of the County People's Committee, gloriously sacrificed himself due to the unfortunate capsizing of his boat in the flood.

Thanks to the timely rescue, all the disaster victims surrounded by the flood have now escaped danger. In order to ensure the lives of the disaster victims, the relevant leading departments of the county have promptly transferred 290,000 catties of grain to the disaster area.

Now that the flood has receded, the County Party Committee is leading the disaster victims in draining water, replanting seedlings, and rebuilding their homes.

    新华社郑州7日电　黄河中下游地区6日普遍降雨，有些地方由中雨到大雨，这是黄河要发生洪水的征候。下游沿岸正呈现着严阵以待洪水的繁忙景象。目前，黄河下游沿岸河南、山东两省和各专区、县的防汛机构都已建立起来，乡、社级的防汛机构也大部建立起来了。河南省防汛工作布置早，进展快，已经组成近二十万人的防汛队伍。沿河各级党、政领导机关对于防汛和生产的结合，以及农业社社员参加防汛时期的记工分红问题，都做了很好的研究和布置。在边整风边改进工作的精神下，各级干部都深入下去检查和帮助工作。黄河防汛总指挥部的负责人和河南、山东两省的副省长也带着防汛检查团，沿黄河实地检查防汛准备工作。各地所需防汛器材，有的已经备妥，有的正在修理或补充。
    据新华社长沙6日电　号称“湖南粮仓”的洞庭湖区，农民已在江水上涨前做好了防汛准备工作。
    据湖南省防汛指挥部负责人说：到6月底，各专区、县都已成立了防汛指挥机构。湖滨地区的常德、湘潭两个专区不完全统计，已组织防汛队伍二十九万多人。
    今年，湖区的防汛物资准备比去年雄厚。国家已拨给洞庭湖区防汛经费八十万元，防汛口粮四百万斤。

    2日到4日，广德县连续降暴雨三一九公厘，山洪暴发，因水势过大，洪水漫过河堤，形成灾害。2日下午，就有三十七个村庄被洪水围困。中共广德县委为及时使被水围困的四千五百多灾民脱险，当即抽调了四百多名干部，由县委负责干部率领四出抢救。县委农村工作部副部长詹立钧在2日夜晚划着小船到大白村救出了站在屋顶上的五十一个灾民。县委财贸部部长陈书春、县委委员胡金保率领干部及时地把港东等七个村被水围困的一千二百多灾民用小船转移到安全地带。在这场紧张抢救中，县人民委员会科员刘高升因在大水中不幸翻船，光荣牺牲。
    由于抢救及时，被大水围困的灾民目前已全部脱险。为保证灾民的生活，县有关领导部门已及时调运了二十九万斤粮食到灾区。
    现在洪水已退，县委正领导灾民排水补苗，重建家园。
