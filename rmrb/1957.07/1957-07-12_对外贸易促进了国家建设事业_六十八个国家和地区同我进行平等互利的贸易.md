Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports: It was learned from the Ministry of Foreign Trade that the total import and export trade volume of my country's first Five-Year Plan is expected to exceed the target by 6.4% by the end of this year. By the end of 1956, the cumulative total trade volume of the first Five-Year Plan had reached 84.56% of the plan. The total import and export trade volume in 1956 increased by approximately 1.6 times compared to 1950. The profits turned over by various foreign trade enterprises during the first Five-Year Plan are roughly equivalent to the amount of the state's basic construction investment plan for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and commerce and finance departments.

Up to now, my country has conducted trade with sixty-eight countries and regions, of which twenty-one countries have signed intergovernmental trade agreements with my country. My country's trade relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have been increasingly consolidated and developed, trade with Asian and African countries has also greatly developed, and trade with many Western countries has increased year by year. My country's trade with various countries is based on the needs of economic construction and is conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

In order to prioritize the development of heavy industry, my country has imported complete sets of equipment necessary for the iron and steel industry, machinery manufacturing industry, power industry, petroleum industry, coal industry, and basic chemical industry in recent years. Of the complete sets of equipment needed for the 156 key enterprises that the Soviet Union helped my country build, the equipment for 43 enterprises has been shipped to China and put into production; it is expected that a total of 59 enterprises will be put into production by the end of this year. My country has also imported from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries various mechanical equipment that cannot be produced domestically for the time being or whose production is insufficient. In the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan, various equipment and machinery accounted for approximately 60% of the total import volume. The import of various heavy industrial equipment and various machinery has played a significant role in the development of my country's industrial production capacity.

In order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production, a large amount of ferrous metals (mainly steel), non-ferrous metals, petroleum and petroleum products, and fertilizers have been imported in recent years. In addition, the import volume of rubber, cotton, dyes, and chemical raw materials is also considerable. The import of these means of production has played a positive role in promoting the development of China's industrial and agricultural production.

In recent years, the import of certain people's daily necessities has also played a certain role in ensuring market needs and withdrawing currency from circulation. These imported goods mainly include sugar, kerosene, medicine, paper, woolen fabrics, watches, and bicycles.

The above-mentioned imported materials are all exchanged for through the export of goods. Since liberation, due to the development of China's industrial and agricultural production, the variety and quantity of export commodities have increased. The export volume accounts for approximately 3% to 4.4% of the total national economic output value. In my country's total export volume, agricultural products and processed products made from agricultural products account for approximately 75%, while mineral products and industrial products such as machinery account for approximately 25%. With the development of my country's industry, the proportion of exported industrial products will gradually increase.

My country's organization of the export of various materials not only solves the state's foreign exchange sources but also promotes the development of the production of these materials. In recent years, in addition to restoring and developing the export of traditional export products, many new export commodities have been added. Many machines that used to rely on imports, such as cranes, various medical devices, and film projectors, can now be supplied for export. Last year, my country also supplied Myanmar with complete sets of equipment for a textile factory with 20,000 spindles. In 1956 alone, the export of handicrafts earned approximately 100 million rubles.

According to comrades from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, since the second half of 1954, my country's handling of the relationship between domestic and foreign sales of materials has taken into account both the current living needs of the people and the long-term interests of the people. In the second half of last year, the domestic market supply of pork was relatively tight, and the export of pork was reduced by 50,000 tons. In this year's export plan, the export volume of several major materials has been reduced by a lot compared to last year. For example, grain has been reduced by 540,000 tons compared to last year, edible oil has been reduced by 100,000 tons compared to last year, and pork and live pigs have been reduced by 85,000 tons compared to last year, cotton yarn has been reduced by more than 12,000 pieces. In addition, efforts have been made to increase the export of mineral products, aquatic products, some industrial machinery, handicrafts, and small local and special products, which have little impact on people's lives.

### 对外贸易促进了国家建设事业  六十八个国家和地区同我进行平等互利的贸易

    对外贸易促进了国家建设事业
    六十八个国家和地区同我进行平等互利的贸易
    据新华社11日讯　新华社记者张志清报道：从对外贸易部获悉，我国对外贸易第一个五年计划进出口贸易总额，预计到今年年底可超额6.4％完成。第一个五年计划贸易总额到1956年年底，累计已经完成计划的84.56％。1956年的进出口贸易总额约比1950年增长一点六倍。第一个五年计划各对外贸易企业单位的上缴利润，大约相当于国家对农业、林业、水利部门和商业、金融部门的基本建设投资计划金额。
    到现在为止，我国已经和六十八个国家和地区进行了贸易，其中有二十一个国家同我国签订了政府间的贸易协定。我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易关系已日益巩固和发展，同亚非国家的贸易也有很大发展，同许多西方国家的贸易逐年增加。我国同各个国家的贸易，都是根据经济建设的需要，并且在平等互利的基础上进行的。
    为了优先发展重工业，几年来我国曾进口了为钢铁工业、机器制造工业、电力工业、石油工业、煤炭工业、基本化学工业等所必需的成套设备。苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项重点企业所需要的成套设备，到目前止，已经有四十三项企业的设备运到国内并投入了生产；预计到今年年底，一共将有五十九项企业投入生产。我国并且从苏联和其他兄弟国家进口了国内暂时还不能生产或生产不敷应用的各种机械设备。在第一个五年计划前四年，进口总额中各种设备和机械约占60％左右。各项重工业设备和各种机械的进口，对我国工业生产能力的发展起了很大的作用。
    为了适应工农业生产的需要，几年来曾经进口大量黑色金属（主要是钢材）、有色金属、石油和石油产品、肥田粉。此外，橡胶、棉花、染料和化工原料等进口的数量也不少。这些生产资料的进口，对促进我国工、农业生产的发展起了积极的作用。
    几年来某些人民生活用品的进口，对保证市场需要和回笼货币也起了一定的作用。这些进口物品主要是食糖、煤油、医药、纸张、呢绒、手表和自行车等。
    上述各种进口物资，都是用货物出口换回来的。解放以后，由于我国工农业生产的发展，出口商品的品种和数量都有增加。出口总额和国民经济生产总值比较，五年的出口额约占国民经济总产值的3％到4.4％。在我国出口总额中，农产品和农产品作原料的加工品约占75％，矿产品和机械等工业品约占25％。随着我国工业的发展，出口工业品的比例，还会逐渐增加。
    我国组织各种物资的出口，一方面解决国家外汇来源，一方面也促进了这些物资生产的发展。几年来，除恢复和发展传统出口产品的出口以外，还增加了很多新的出口商品。许多过去依靠进口的机器如起重机、各种医疗器械、电影放映机等，现在已能供应出口了。去年我国还供应了缅甸两万纱锭的纺织工厂成套设备。仅1956年出口的手工艺品就换回约一亿卢布。
    据对外贸易部的同志说，自1954年下半年以后，我国对物资内外销关系的处理，既照顾到人民当前的生活需要，又照顾到人民长远的利益。去年下半年，国内市场猪肉供应比较紧张，出口猪肉曾减少了五万吨。今年出口计划中，几种主要物资的出口数量又比去年减少很多，如粮食比去年减少了五十四万吨，食用油脂比去年减少了十万吨，猪肉和生猪比去年减少八点五万吨，棉纱减少了一万二千多件。另外设法增加了同人民生活影响不大的矿产品、水产品、一部分工业机器、手工业品和小土产特产品的出口。
