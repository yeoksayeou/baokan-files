After studying Chairman Mao’s speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and listening to Premier Zhou’s government work report, my heart was deeply moved.

A person cannot be without recollection, especially someone like me, over seventy years old. I recall my life experiencing the dark eras of the Manchu Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the Japanese imperialist invasion. The country was controlled by feudalism and imperialism, it was fragmented, the politics were corrupt and the lives of the vast majority of the people were in dire straits. In short, the country was no longer a country, and the people were not living. Many people with lofty ideals were heartbroken and tried to save the country, but they could not find the right way and ultimately failed. The Communist Party of China armed itself with Marxism-Leninism and resolutely shouldered the great task of saving the country and the people. After a difficult and tortuous path, it finally, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, completed the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the victory of the democratic revolution, the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and the basic victory of the socialist revolution. This year will also see the completion and over-fulfillment of the victory of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. The country has seen unprecedented unity, and has gained high prestige internationally. Hundreds of millions of working people are working day and night on ardent and arduous construction work, and people's lives have been generally improved. Without the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, it is unimaginable that such great and glorious achievements could have been achieved. Chairman Mao taught us: "Only socialism can save China." Premier Zhou said: "Only a socialist New China can consider the interests of all the people." From what I have seen and experienced in person over the past few decades, this is incredibly true and perfectly correct. I wholeheartedly support it.

In such a large country of 600 million people, carrying out a huge transformation unprecedented in thousands of years of history, it is inevitable that some errors and shortcomings in work will occur while achieving brilliant and splendid victories. In order to carry out the socialist construction cause better and faster, and to overcome certain errors and shortcomings caused by the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism left over from the past exploitative system, the Party Central Committee is carrying out rectification within the Party and calling on people outside the Party to help with the rectification. This is a wise measure of the working-class party to serve the people selflessly and wholeheartedly. Many people outside the Party have also reflected the situation and provided opinions and suggestions with a sincere attitude and from good intentions. The Party Central Committee is open-minded, carefully considers and adopts good suggestions, and corrects mistakes. Its mind is broad, and its spirit is great. At this time, the bourgeois rightists, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi, who have been waiting for an opportunity to move, believe that the time for opposing the Party and socialism has matured. They have advanced on all fronts, putting forward so-called "political design institutes," "rehabilitation committees," "Party world," "rotation of power among parties," "great power chauvinism," "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism," and other arrogant and absurd remarks to reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, and attempt to weaken and eliminate the leadership of the Party, overthrow the basic socialist system, and drag New China back to the capitalist road of return. The capitalist road of return means overthrowing the fruits of victory achieved by the Communist Party of China's more than 30 years of heroic struggle, the bloodshed and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, and the hard work of hundreds of millions of working people, and returning to the miserable situation of being enslaved and oppressed. This is something that every patriotic person absolutely cannot agree with, cannot tolerate in the slightest, and must resolutely fight back. Chairman Mao listed six criteria in his speech, and said that the most important are the two criteria of the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. The activities of these rightists are precisely anti-Party and anti-socialist. This is tolerable, what is intolerable!

Zhang Naiqi is the Public Enemy of the Industrial and Commercial Circles

Here, as a member working in the industrial and commercial circles, I want to especially accuse the rightist Zhang Naiqi! Most of the industrial and commercial circles are patriotic, because they have suffered from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and want to get rid of these three mountains pressing on their heads, so they sympathize with the democratic revolution, and some people also participated in the democratic revolution. But in terms of the essence of the bourgeoisie, it is impossible for them to naturally love socialism. After liberation, on the basis of the correct policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce implemented by the Party and the government, the Chinese national bourgeoisie saw that the motherland, which had always been bullied, stood up strong, and therefore felt glory. Then, after long-term education from the Party and the government, they gradually understood that to make the motherland rich and strong, they must take the socialist road, and to make their children and grandchildren happy, they must take the socialist road. After further studying Chairman Mao’s cordial teachings on understanding the laws of social development and mastering their own destiny, they understood that taking the socialist road is the inevitable law of historical development, and therefore strengthened their confidence in accepting socialist transformation. Finally, influenced by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and driven by the enthusiasm of the workers to take the socialist road, a high tide of demanding joint state-private ownership of the entire industry emerged. This is a big step forward for our industrial and commercial circles towards the transition to socialism. However, the entry of enterprises into joint ownership does not mean the complete transformation of the essence of industrialists and businessmen. The transformation of the essence of industrialists and businessmen must be a transformation that is a complete change, not a cover-up that changes the appearance. Therefore, after the high tide of enterprise joint ownership, while affirming that the positive side of industrialists and businessmen has increased, it must be pointed out that the negative side still exists, so as to strengthen the self-vigilance and in-depth transformation of industrialists and businessmen. This is in line with the most basic interests of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen. But Zhang Naiqi is not like this. He seized on the negative side of the thinking of the industrial and commercial circles, insidiously spread poison, saying that everyone has two sides, that there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and workers, and that fixed interest is not exploitation, etc. He used this kind of anesthetic poison and sugar-coated arsenic to deceive and poison the industrial and commercial circles, so that the industrial and commercial circles denied the leadership of the working class and relaxed or even resisted transformation. Over the past year, Zhang Naiqi's reactionary activities have become even more rampant. He has made fallacies at various meetings, causing ideological confusion among many industrialists and businessmen. He also seized the opportunity to spread reactionary fallacies to the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce during inspections, which greatly affected the work in various places. Recently, when the Communist Party held rectification, his arrogance and absurdity reached its peak. He greatly encouraged Li Kangnian’s proposal to fix interest for twenty years, saying that he was too eager to enter socialism. Obviously, prolonging exploitation is definitely not to enter socialism, but to cover up the restoration of capitalism. He also encouraged Huang Miaofu, another industrialist and businessman in Shanghai, to publish absurd remarks, and was willing to support him. He tempted the industrial and commercial circles to take an antagonistic attitude towards the working class. He said that the transformation of industrialists and businessmen was not as good as the labor transformation of landlords, and said in an inflammatory tone: “Are we going to have another Five-Anti Campaign?” In short, Zhang Naiqi did everything he could to deceive, intimidate, and incite the industrial and commercial circles. He wanted to win over the industrial and commercial circles to achieve his personal ulterior political motives. He believed that the more complaints the industrial and commercial circles had, the greater his capital would be. All of Zhang Naiqi’s activities are to oppose the leadership of the Party, resist transformation, expand the antagonistic side of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and make the industrial and commercial circles follow him down the road to death of self-destruction from the people and alienation from the united front. He is truly the public enemy of our industrial and commercial circles!

Some People in the Industrial and Commercial Circles Do Not Have a Strong Enough Fighting Spirit Against the Rightists and Should Further Train Themselves in the Struggle

Since Minister Li pointed out that this is a struggle between two lines, the People's Daily editorial exposed the reactionary essence of the rightists, and the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce exposed Zhang Naiqi's consistent and systematic anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions, and called on the national industrial and commercial circles to draw a political and ideological line between him and launch a resolute and thorough struggle, the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles began to wake up under this "loud shout." However, the degree is very uneven. Most people can recognize Zhang Naiqi's essence and therefore criticize and refute him; but some people do not have enough understanding of the harmfulness of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary fallacies, do not have enough understanding of this struggle between two roads, and therefore do not have a strong enough fighting spirit to counterattack Zhang Naiqi and other rightists; and some people still sympathize with Zhang Naiqi and are not yet enlightened. This shows that launching a struggle against rightists in the industrial and commercial circles is a very arduous ideological task, and it is also a concrete practice for the industrial and commercial circles to break capitalist ideas and establish socialist ideas. Because the industrial and commercial circles are being transformed, they have a positive side and a negative side. Developing the positive side is the force for launching the struggle, but the negative side, which has a commonality with Zhang Naiqi’s thinking, must be seriously criticized at the same time in order to effectively launch the struggle. Therefore, the purpose and requirements of our struggle are, on the one hand, to draw a line with Zhang Naiqi and smash the conspiracy of the rightists to oppose the Party and socialism; on the other hand, to examine our thinking and improve our understanding from the struggle to strengthen our self-transformation. As far as I am concerned, under the cultivation and education of the Party for eight years, I sincerely support the leadership of the Party. In the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, I have followed the principles and policies of the Party and the government, and I am willing to see the early completion of socialism. However, due to the fact that the Chinese national bourgeoisie still has two sides, I also have a negative and backward side. In general, I oppose Zhang Naiqi's absurd remarks, but some of his words once resonated with me. Recently, I made a review and found that my wrong thinking on some events was serious. For example, last year, the China Democratic National Construction Association held a central standing committee meeting and a second plenary session, and everyone criticized Zhang Naiqi’s erroneous views on the issue of two-sidedness. Looking at it today, those two meetings were actually a struggle between two different political lines for our China Democratic National Construction Association. At that time, my understanding of this significance was not enough. Although I also participated in the criticism of Zhang Naiqi, I had a certain sympathy for some aspects of Zhang Naiqi. I did not recognize the importance of that struggle from a political perspective, but only unilaterally emphasized unity and methods. This is obviously wrong.

For example, at the symposium on industrial and commercial transformation guidance work of the China Democratic National Construction Association in May this year, Zhang Naiqi spoke, saying that fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income. After Zhang Naiqi finished speaking, I said that fixed interest was taken out by the working class, and it can also be said that the working class gave it to the bourgeoisie, because the bourgeoisie handed over the enterprise. Now, after checking, these words are also wrong, reflecting that my understanding of fixed interest is still not correct.

I feel very guilty for checking the above matters. When Minister Li pointed out that this was a struggle between two roads at the end of the meeting of industrial and commercial circles held by the Central United Front Work Department, I had an ideological improvement and I seriously conducted a self-examination. I realized that to participate in the struggle against the rightists, especially to forcefully counterattack the rightists, is inseparable from the individual's ideological transformation. We must deeply examine our own thinking, distinguish right from wrong, and truly draw a line with the rightists.

From myself, I can infer that many comrades and friends in the industrial and commercial circles must have sympathized with Zhang Naiqi, or agreed with Zhang Naiqi’s views on certain issues. I hope that these comrades and friends will quickly participate in this struggle against Zhang Naiqi’s rightist faction, and examine and train themselves in the struggle.

The Industrial and Commercial Circles Must Bravely Stand Up and Resolutely Participate in the Anti-Rightist Struggle

Now that Chairman Mao's speech has been published, and Premier Zhou has made a report to the congress with extremely profound content, we have the weapons of struggle. I am clear that the large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle of the revolutionary period has basically ended, but the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field still exists, and it is long-term, tortuous, and even fierce. I also realize that there is still an antagonistic side between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and there is still class struggle, which further makes me realize that the absurd remarks of the rightists are not the isolated reactionary activities of individual careerists, but the concentrated expression of the antagonistic side of the bourgeoisie against the working class. The current nationwide anti-rightist struggle is also a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in politics and ideology. For our industrial and commercial circles, it is an extremely serious ideological transformation movement, so we must actively participate in the struggle.

Why is it so easy for workers and peasants to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, while we in the industrial and commercial circles waver and blur the lines between right and wrong? This shows that the bourgeoisie’s thoughts and feelings in the industrial and commercial circles easily resonate with the negative side concentratedly expressed by the rightists. The bourgeoisie’s thoughts and feelings make us unable to stand firmly on the socialist position, and make us waver in the face of major issues. If the Party Central Committee had not promptly exposed the reactionary essence of the rightists, clearly pointed out that this is a struggle between two roads, and allowed Zhang Naiqi’s reactionary activities to develop, what consequences would have occurred for the transformation of our industrial and commercial circles if more and more people were deceived and confused? Thinking about it makes me shudder! Therefore, I sincerely thank the Party for its wisdom and greatness, foresight, timely reminder, and loud shout, which has made many industrialists and businessmen firm up from wavering and wake up from confusion, so that they can smoothly transition to socialism. In short, our industrial and commercial circles must bravely stand up and resolutely participate in the anti-rightist struggle. This is not only to thoroughly smash the conspiracy of the rightists to oppose the Party and socialism, but also a concrete practice for our self-education and self-transformation. We must improve our socialist consciousness, stand firm on the socialist position, sharpen our eyes, distinguish right from wrong, and further accept transformation from the anti-rightist struggle. We must recognize that only by listening to Chairman Mao’s words will we not lose our direction, and only by following the Communist Party will we have a bright future.

    右派分子是想把新中国拉回到资本主义路上去
    盛丕华说：是可忍，孰不可忍！
    学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，又听了周总理的政府工作报告，我的内心是非常激动的。
    人不能没有回想，尤其是像我这样七十多岁的人，回想到我的一生经历着满清王朝、北洋军阀、国民党反动统治、日本帝国主义侵略等一系列的黑暗时代，国家是封建主义、帝国主义控制着的，是分崩离析的，政治是腐败贪污恶劣的，绝大多数人民的生活是水深火热、朝不保暮的。总而言之，是国已不国，民不聊生。不少仁人志士目击心伤，起图挽救，然而不得其道，终于无成。中国共产党以马列主义思想武装了自己，毅然决然肩负起救国救民的大任，经历了艰难曲折的道路，终于在党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，完成了对日抗战的胜利、民主革命的胜利、抗美援朝的胜利、社会主义革命的基本胜利，到今年还要完成和超额完成发展国民经济第一个五年计划的胜利。国内出现了从来未有的团结和统一，国际间取得了崇高的威望，几万万劳动人民夜以继日地进行着热烈而又艰苦的建设工作，人民生活得到了普遍的提高。没有中国共产党的正确领导，没有社会主义制度的无比优越性，而能够获得这样巨大的光辉的成就是不可想像的。毛主席教导我们说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”，周总理说：“只有社会主义新中国才能够为全体人民利益着想”。从我几十年来亲眼看到和亲身体验，这话是无比真实的，是万分正确的。我衷心拥护。
    在这样一个六亿人民的大国中，进行着几千年历史上从未有过的巨大变革，在取得了光辉灿烂的胜利成果的同时，发生了一些工作上的错误和缺点，这原是不可避免的。党中央为了把社会主义建设事业进行得更好更快，克服由于过去剥削制度所遗留下来的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义所造成的某些错误和缺点，进行党内整风，并号召党外人士帮助整风，这是工人阶级政党大公无私全心全意为人民服务的英明措施。不少党外人士也都以诚恳的态度，从善意出发反映情况，提供意见和建议，党中央虚怀若谷，悉心考虑，择善而从，有错必纠，胸襟是宽阔的，气魄是伟大的。就在这时候，待机而动的资产阶级右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等竟以为反党反社会主义的时机已经成熟，从各个方面齐头并进，提出所谓：“政治设计院”“平反委员会”“党天下”“各党轮流执政”“大党主义”“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”等等狂妄荒谬的言论来颠倒是非，混淆黑白，冀图削弱、取消党的领导，推翻社会主义基本制度，把新中国拉回到资本主义的回头路上去。资本主义的回头路意味着要推翻由于中国共产党三十多年的英勇奋斗、无数革命烈士流血牺牲、几万万劳动人民辛勤劳动而取得的胜利果实而重行回到被奴役被压迫的悲惨境地中去，这是我们每一个爱国的人民所绝对不能同意、丝毫不能容忍而必须加以坚决回击的。毛主席讲话中列举了六条标准，并说最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条标准，这些右派分子的活动正是反党反社会主义的，是可忍孰不可忍！
    章乃器是工商界的公仇
    在这里，作为在工商界担任工作的一分子的我，要特别对右派分子章乃器加以控诉！工商界大多数是爱国的，这是因为他们身受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫，要摆脱这三座压在自己头上的大山，所以同情民主革命，有些人也参加了民主革命。但是就资产阶级本质来说，他们不可能很自然地爱社会主义的。解放以后，在党和政府对资本主义工商业正确地执行利用、限制和改造的政策的基础之上，中国民族资产阶级眼看到一直受人欺侮的祖国坚强地站起来了，因而感到光荣，接着受了党和政府长期的教育，逐步懂得要祖国富强，必须走社会主义道路，要子孙幸福，必须走社会主义道路，再学习了毛主席认识社会发展规律、掌握自己命运的亲切教导，更懂得了走社会主义道路是人类历史发展的必然规律，因而坚定了接受社会主义改造的信心，终于受到农业合作化高潮的影响和职工群众要走社会主义道路的热情的推动，出现了要求全行业公私合营的高潮。这是我们工商界向社会主义的过渡迈进一大步。但是企业进入合营并不等于工商业者本质的彻底改造，工商业者本质的改造必须是脱胎换骨的改造，而不是改头换面的掩饰；因此企业合营高潮后，在肯定工商业者积极一面有所增长的同时，必须指出消极一面的依然存在，从而加强工商业者自我警惕和深入改造，这才是符合广大工商业者最基本的利益。但章乃器却不是这样，他抓住工商界思想上消极的一面，阴险地散布毒素，说什么两面性大家都有，说资产阶级分子与工人已经没有本质的不同，说定息不是剥削等等。他就是用这种麻醉的毒酒、蜜饯的砒霜来欺骗、毒害工商界，使工商界否定于工人阶级的领导，使工商界放松改造乃至抗拒改造。一年以来，章乃器反动活动更形猖狂，在各种会议上发表谬论，使不少工商业者思想混乱，出去视察也要抓住机会向民建、工商联散布反动谬论，因而大大影响各地工作。到最近共产党举行整风，他的狂妄荒谬登峰造极，他对李康年提出定息二十年的主张大加鼓励，说他是过急地要进社会主义。显然，延长剥削绝对不是要进社会主义，而是为资本主义复辟打掩护。他还鼓励上海另外一个工商业者黄苗夫发表荒谬言论，愿意为他撑腰。他诱惑工商界与工人阶级采取对立的态度。他把工商业者的改造说成比地主的劳动改造都不如，用煽动的口吻说：
  “难道还要来一个五反吗？”总而言之，章乃器对工商界极尽欺骗恐吓煽动的能事，他要拉拢工商界达到其个人的不可告人的政治目的，他认为工商界牢骚越多，他的本钱越大。章乃器的一切活动就是要反对党的领导，抗拒改造，扩大资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的对抗性一面，要工商界跟着他一道走到自绝于人民、自外于统一战线的死亡道路上去。他真是我们工商界的公仇！
    工商界中有些人对右派的斗志还不够坚强，应该在斗争中进一步锻炼自己
    自从李部长指出这是两条路线的斗争，人民日报社论揭穿右派分子的反动本质，民建会、全国工商业联合会揭穿了章乃器一贯地系统地进行反党反社会主义言论行动，号召全国工商界和他划清政治上和思想上的界限，展开坚决的彻底的斗争后，上海工商界在这“大喝一声”之下，开始觉醒。但是程度很不平衡，多数人是能够认清章乃器本质因而加以批判驳斥的；但也有人对于章乃器反动谬论危害性认识不足，对于这是两条道路的斗争认识不足，因而反击章乃器等右派的斗志还不够坚强；也还有人对章乃器表示同情，执迷未悟的。这说明在工商界中展开反右派分子斗争是一个很艰巨的思想工作，同时也是工商界破资本主义思想、立社会主义思想的具体实践。因为工商界正在改造，它有积极的一面，也还有消极的一面，发扬积极的一面，这是展开斗争的力量，但对它的消极的一面，也就是与章乃器的思想有共同性的一面，必须同时进行严肃的批判，才能使斗争有力地展开。所以我们对这次斗争的目的要求，一方面要与章乃器划清界限，粉碎右派分子反党反社会主义的阴谋；另一方面也要从斗争中检查思想、提高认识来加强自我改造。即就我本人来说，八年以来在党的培养教育下，我对党的领导是极诚拥护的。在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中，我是遵循着党和政府的方针政策来办事的，我是愿意早日看到社会主义建成的。但是由于中国民族资产阶级还存在有两面性，我也有消极落后的一面，对于章乃器的荒谬言论，总的讲来，我是反对的，但是他有一些话，曾经引起我的共鸣。最近我作了一次检查，发现有一些事件上，我的错误思想是严重的。例如去年民建举行中常会和二中全会，大家对章乃器的关于两面性的问题错误看法展开了批评。那两次会议，在今天看来，对于我们民建实在是两条不同的政治路线的斗争。在当时，我对于这种意义认识是不够的，虽然也参加对章乃器的批评，但对章乃器某些地方有一定的同情，我不从政治意义上来认识那一场斗争的重要性，而只是片面的强调团结和方式方法。这显然是错误的。
    又如今年五月间民建的工商改造辅导工作座谈会上，章乃器来讲话，讲到定息不是剥削而是不劳而获。在章乃器讲完后，我就说定息是工人阶级拿出来的，也可以说工人阶级对资产阶级赠与，因为资产阶级交出了企业。现在检查起来，这话也是错误的，反映了我对定息的认识还是不正确的。
    检查以上事情，我的内心很负疚。当李部长在中央统战部召开工商界会议结束时，指出这是两条道路的斗争。我有了思想提高，我认真地作了自我检查。我体会到要参加反右派的斗争，特别是要有力地反击右派分子，同个人的思想改造是分不开的。必须深刻地检查自己的思想，明辨是非，才能真正同右派分子划清界限。
    从我自己推想到工商界的同志们、朋友们，一定会有不少人同我一样，曾经对章乃器同情过的，或者在某些问题上赞成章乃器的看法的，我希望这些同志们、朋友们赶紧参加这一对章乃器右派分子的斗争，在斗争中检查自己、锻炼自己。
    工商界必须勇敢地站起来坚决地投入反右派斗争
    现在毛主席的讲话发表了，周总理又向大会作了内容极为深刻的报告，我们有了斗争的武器，我明确革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众性阶级斗争已基本结束，但无产阶级和资产阶级在意识形态方面的阶级斗争还是存在，而且是长期的、曲折的，甚至激烈的。我还认识到目前还存在着资产阶级同工人阶级对抗性的一面，还存在着阶级斗争，因此使我进一步认清右派分子的荒谬言论不是个别野心家的孤立的反动活动，而正是目前资产阶级对工人阶级对抗一面的集中表现。现在全国规模的反右派斗争也就是无产阶级和资产阶级在政治上和思想上的阶级斗争，对我们工商界讲来，是一场极其严肃的思想改造运动，所以我们必须积极地参加斗争。
    为什么工人农民对香花毒草那么容易辨别，而我们工商界却是摇摇摆摆模糊是非呢？这就是说明工商界的资产阶级的思想感情很容易与右派分子集中表现的消极一面发生或多或少的共鸣。资产阶级的思想感情使我们站不稳社会主义的立场，使我们在大是大非的面前摇摆不定，如果没有党中央及时揭穿右派分子的反动本质，明确指出这是两条道路的斗争，让章乃器反动活动发展下去，受欺骗迷惑的多起来，对我们工商界的改造将发生怎样后果呢？想起来，真是不寒而栗！因此我从衷心里感谢党的英明伟大，高瞻远瞩，及时提醒，大喝一声，使不少工商业者从摇摆中坚定起来，从迷糊中清醒过来，能够平平稳稳过渡到社会主义。总之，我们工商界必须勇敢地站起来，坚决地投入反右派的斗争，这不仅是为了彻底粉碎右派分子反党反社会主义的阴谋，也是我们自我教育、自我改造的具体实践。我们要从反右派斗争中，提高社会主义觉悟，站稳社会主义立场，擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，进一步接受改造。我们必须认识：只有听毛主席的话，才不致迷失方向，只有跟共产党走，才是我们光明大道。
