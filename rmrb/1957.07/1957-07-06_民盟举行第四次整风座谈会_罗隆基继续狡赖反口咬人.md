The China Democratic League Holds Fourth Rectification Symposium
Luo Longji Continues to Equivocate and Make Counter-Accusations

(Our Newspaper) July 5th – Last night, at the China Democratic League Central Committee’s fourth rectification symposium, Luo Longji continued to use extremely vile methods to quibble.

At the beginning of the meeting, Gao Chongmin announced that after Shao Ciyun, Luo Longji's secretary, revealed Luo Longji's letter at the last symposium, Luo Longji called several responsible persons of the China Democratic League that night, saying that Pu Xixiu had told him that Shao Ciyun was suspected of being a special agent, which is why he treated Shao Ciyun poorly. As soon as Gao Chongmin finished speaking, someone immediately asked Pu Xixiu to explain; someone questioned why Luo Longji desperately tried to get her to join the League if he knew Shao Ciyun was suspected of being a special agent; Pu Xixiu also denied that she had ever said such a thing to Luo Longji. At this time, Sun Pingyi, Luo Longji's secretary from the Ministry of Forestry Industry, spoke, supplementing and confirming Luo Longji's attacks and persecution of Shao Ciyun. Representatives of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Ministry of Forestry Industry read out an open letter from the Communist Youth League organization of the Ministry of Forestry Industry condemning Luo Longji's anti-socialist conspiracy. Shi Liang read out Shao Ciyun's letter, in which Shao Ciyun demanded an investigation into why Luo Longji had slandered her as a special agent. At this time, Shi Liang, who was chairing the meeting, asked Luo Longji to first explain the problem of persecuting and slandering Shao Ciyun. However, Luo Longji still insisted that he had only checked Shao Ciyun's files after hearing Pu Xixiu's words. When Pu Xixiu once again denied that she had said this, Luo Longji brazenly said, "Then there is no way to prove it." At this time, Shi Liang and Liu Qingyang successively stood up to question him: Luo Longji has always sheltered and sympathized with counter-revolutionaries, why was he so vigilant about Shao Ciyun; Shao Ciyun was first recommended by Luo Longji to Dahe, and later wanted to be his secretary, why did he suddenly want to check Shao Ciyun's file materials.

Next, Shi Liang asked Luo Longji to explain the Zhang-Luo alliance issue. Luo Longji did not directly answer whether there was an alliance between Zhang and Luo, but only after repeated questioning by everyone, did he confess that Zhang Bojun and he engaged in the issue of the higher education system and the issue of four committees with positions but no power, with the aim of abolishing the Party committee system and raising the status of the China Democratic League, so as to confront the Party. Luo Longji also said that after the CCP put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Zhang Bojun said to me that our democratic parties have a lot to do now and can do a lot. Luo Longji also believed that it was time to raise his head and vent his anger. And said, "The schools are making a lot of noise. Through the discussion of these four committees, the China Democratic League Central Committee will send people to various places to promote work, abolish the Party committee system, and achieve positions with power. I agree with Zhang Bojun's opinion. Zhang Bojun and I jointly issued a notice to the China Democratic League organizations in various places, asking everyone to speak out loudly. Zhang Bojun also said to me that the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is also launching a series of symposiums and sending people to all parts of the country to develop organizations."

Luo Ziwei revealed some of Luo Longji's despicable behaviors, saying that Luo Longji had a nickname in the China Democratic League called "Soul Snatcher." If anyone had shortcomings that he discovered, he would exploit them. Whoever was exploited by him would be led to the gates of hell. Luo Ziwei also said: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of the whole country opposed the traitorous Sino-American Commercial Treaty, but Luo Longji explained it everywhere, saying that the treaty was equal. Even when the people of Shanghai held a meeting to oppose it, Luo Longji was angry behind his back, believing that the China Democratic League should not oppose this traitorous treaty.

Luo Ziwei wanted Luo Longji to confess whether he had colluded with the United States. Luo Ziwei also questioned Luo Longji as to whether he intended to turn the CPPCC Cultural Club into a Petőfi Club. At this time, Luo Longji counter-attacked Luo Ziwei, saying: I think Luo Ziwei can reveal more problems, because you were also a member of my informal organization at that time. Luo Ziwei immediately angrily refuted Luo Longji's false accusation. At this time, a wave of indignant rebukes resounded through the venue.

Zhou Xinmin spoke to expose Luo Longji. In Kunming from 1944 to 1945, he resolutely opposed the Party's leadership of the Kunming "Democratic Youth League," wanting to change it into an organization subordinate to the China Democratic League, and attempted to replace Wu Han with Pan Dakui to lead the organization. Luo Longji admitted that he wanted to make the Democratic Youth League subordinate to the China Democratic League, but he said that he did not know that the Democratic Youth League was an organization led by the Party.

When Pan Dakui stood up to speak, he claimed that he wanted to expose the fact that Luo Longji controlled the Sichuan League organization through him. However, in his twenty-minute speech, he only repeated some facts that had already been revealed in the newspapers, without any new material.

Next, Pan Guangdan, one of Luo Longji's small clique, confessed the list of Luo Longji's small clique. However, Pan Guangdan did not explain the inside activities of this small clique. And he said that after 1952, he had no contact with Luo Longji.

At the end of the meeting, Shi Liang said that today was the fourth confession, but Luo Longji still had not confessed, and was still quibbling with ready-made things. He warned him not to cut himself off from the people.

    民盟举行第四次整风座谈会
    罗隆基继续狡赖反口咬人
    本报讯　7月5日夜，罗隆基在民盟中央第四次整风座谈会上，依然用各种极端恶劣的手段进行狡辩。
    会议一开始，高崇民宣布，在上次座谈会上宣读了罗隆基的秘书邵慈云揭发罗隆基的信件后，当夜，罗隆基打电话给民盟的几位负责人，说浦熙修曾经告诉他说邵慈云有特务嫌疑，因此他才对邵慈云不好。高崇民的话刚一讲完，立即有人要浦熙修交代；有人质问，既然罗隆基知道邵慈云有特务嫌疑，为什么还拼命拉她入盟；浦熙修也否认了她曾向罗隆基说过这样的话。这时，森林工业部罗隆基的秘书孙平毅发言，补充和证实了罗隆基对邵慈云的打击和迫害。森工部共青团委会的代表宣读了森工部共青团组织谴责罗隆基的反社会主义阴谋活动的公开信。史良宣读了邵慈云的信，邵慈云要求追查罗隆基为什么污蔑她有特务嫌疑。这时主持会议的史良要求罗隆基首先交代迫害并且污蔑邵慈云的问题。而罗隆基仍然一口咬定说是听了浦熙修的话才去查邵慈云的档案。当浦熙修再一次否认她曾说过这话时，罗隆基就撒赖说：“那就死无对证了”。这时，史良、刘清扬先后起来质问他：罗隆基一向包庇同情反革命分子，为什么对邵慈云就这样警惕；邵慈云是罗隆基先推荐到和大，以后又要来给自己做秘书的，为什么忽然要查邵慈云的档案材料。
    接着，史良要罗隆基交代章罗联盟问题。罗隆基并没有正面回答章罗之间有没有联盟，只是在大家的一再质问下，才交代了章伯钧和他搞高等学校体制问题、有职无权问题等四个委员会的目的是要取消党委制、提高民盟的地位，好和党分庭抗礼。罗隆基并说，在中共提出“百家争鸣、百花齐放，长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，章伯钧对我说现在我们民主党派大有可为，可以大做特做。罗隆基也认为抬头出气的时候到了。并说，“各学校闹的厉害，通过这四个委员会的讨论，由民盟中央派人到各地去推动工作，取消党委制，做到有职有权。我是赞成章伯钧的这个意见。章伯钧和我联名向各地民盟组织发出通知，要大家大放大鸣。章伯钧并向我说，农工民主党也正在发动一系列的座谈会，并派人到全国各地去发展组织。”
    罗子为揭发了罗隆基的一些卑劣行为，说罗隆基在民盟有一个绰号叫“勾死鬼”，谁要有缺点被他发现，他就要利用谁，谁要被他利用，就要被他带到鬼门关。罗子为还说：抗战胜利后，全国人民反对卖国的美蒋商约，而罗隆基到处为之解释，说这个条约是平等的。甚至于当时上海人民开会反对，罗隆基还背后发脾气，认为民盟不该反对这个卖国条约。
    罗子为要罗隆基交代是否与美国有勾结。罗子为还质问罗隆基是否要把政协文化俱乐部搞成裴多菲俱乐部。这时罗隆基竟然对罗子为反咬一口，说：我认为罗子为还可以多揭发一些问题，因为你也是当时我的无形组织的成员之一。罗子为立即愤怒地驳斥了罗隆基的反诬。这时，会场上响起一片激愤的斥责声。
    周新民发言揭露罗隆基，在1944—1945年在昆明时期，坚决反对党领导昆明“民主青年联盟”，要把它改为民盟的隶属组织，并企图以潘大逵代替吴晗来领导这个组织。罗隆基承认他要把民青隶属民盟，但是他说不知道民青是党领导的组织。
    潘大逵起来发言时声称他要揭发罗隆基通过他把持四川盟组织的事实。但是他在二十分钟的发言中，尽是重复报纸上已经揭发出来的一些事实，没有一点新的材料。
    接着，罗隆基小集团之一潘光旦交代了罗隆基小集团的名单。但是，潘光旦没有交代这个小集团的内幕活动。并且说，1952年以后，他和罗隆基就没有什么联系了。
    会议结束时，史良说，今天是第四次交代，但罗隆基仍没交代，依然是拿现成的东西狡辩。并警告他不要自绝于人民。
