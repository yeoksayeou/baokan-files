    Saving in Name Only, Waste in Reality
    The paper bags used by the state to hold cement were originally made of five layers of paper sewn together. Since switching to three-layer paper bags, the paper that used to make three bags can now make five. This is definitely a saving in the use of paper for making bags. However, the damage rate has increased tenfold. With more broken paper bags, the loss of cement is bound to be greater. The shortage of paper is a fact, and we should try to save as much as possible, but we should not save in one department and cause waste in another. Such savings are one-sided and false. We hope that the relevant departments in charge will carefully study again which aspect has greater advantages and smaller disadvantages.

### 名为节约，实为浪费

    名为节约，实为浪费
    国家用来装水泥的纸袋，原先是五层纸缝制的。自从改用三层纸制的以后，原先做三个的纸，现在就可以做五个，这在做袋子的用纸上，肯定是节约了。但破损率却增加了十倍。纸袋坏的多，水泥的损失也就必然要多。纸张缺是事实，应当尽量节约，但不应在一个部门节约，而在另一个部门造成浪费。这样的节约，是片面的，是虚假的。希望有关主管部门再慎重地研究一下，究竟哪方面利大利小。
