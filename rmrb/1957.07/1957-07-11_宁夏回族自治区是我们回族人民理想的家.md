Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is the Ideal Home for Our Hui People

Da Punsheng said: Our Hui people are all jubilant, spreading the news, and celebrating this great happy event. Every household sincerely thanks the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism. Firmly relying on the leadership of the Party is our greatest guarantee for the victorious construction of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

I fully agree with the various reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Ulanhu. These reports truthfully illustrate the great achievements of our motherland in the past year. I was very excited after listening to them.

Before the conference, Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published. I fully support Chairman Mao's speech. Chairman Mao's speech enhanced my understanding and made me more confident to participate in the great cause of building socialism in the motherland.

Now I would like to talk about my personal feelings on the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

I fully agree with Vice Premier Ulanhu's report and fully support the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. When our Hui people heard this news, they were all jubilant, spreading the news, and celebrating this great happy event for the Hui ethnic group. Every household sincerely thanks the Communist Party, thanks Chairman Mao, and thanks socialism.

National regional autonomy is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's basic policy for solving China's ethnic issues, and it is the gate for our ethnic minorities to enter a prosperous and happy life. Since the founding of New China, four Hui autonomous prefectures, nine Hui autonomous counties, one autonomous county jointly with other fraternal ethnic groups, and more than ten Hui residential districts and hundreds of ethnic townships have been established in areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities. In places where the policy of national regional autonomy has been implemented, political, economic, cultural and other constructions have greatly developed, and the unity, friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups have become more consolidated.

Take the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu as an example. From 1950 to 1956, the total grain output of this autonomous prefecture increased by more than 279 percent, afforestation increased by more than 4,500 times, the irrigated area increased by 424 percent, the number of minority students increased by 1.54 times, the people's purchasing power increased by 456 percent, and savings increased by 75 times. A large number of ethnic minority cadres have also grown up in practical work. The relationship between all fraternal ethnic groups has also become closer and more harmonious. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, without the policy of national regional autonomy, how could there be such rapid and great development?

Both the Zhuang and Hui ethnic groups are among the larger ethnic minorities in China, but in the past, no autonomous region at the provincial level had been established. The Chinese Communist Party successively advocated the establishment of provincial-level autonomous regions for the Hui and Zhuang ethnic groups in February and October last year. This makes these two ethnic groups more adapted to their status in the big family of the motherland and can more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of our two ethnic groups to build the socialist motherland, and make the unity of all ethnic groups in our country more consolidated. This is fully in line with the wishes of the Zhuang and Hui people, and fully in line with the interests of all ethnic groups in the country. I believe that our conference will unanimously approve this proposal.

The Hui people throughout the country number more than 3.5 million. Due to historical reasons, most of them live in various parts of the country. Now it is very appropriate to choose Ningxia and its surrounding areas in Gansu, where the Hui population is relatively large, to establish the Hui Autonomous Region. This region includes 17 counties and two cities, covering an area of more than 77,800 square kilometers, with a population of more than 1.7 million. It is rich in products and has many mineral deposits. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will pass through the territory. This is a region with great development prospects and an ideal home for our Hui people. I fully support the plan proposed in Vice Premier Ulanhu's report.

The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is about to be established. This is the ideal of our Hui people for thousands of years. Our Hui people, like the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, are hardworking, brave, and full of wisdom. It is only because of the long-term ethnic oppression and class oppression suffered in old China that we are in a backward state in terms of politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. We must build the autonomous region well. We will definitely be able to develop our political, economic, cultural and other constructions under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of the fraternal ethnic groups throughout the country, especially the Han ethnic group, and gradually become an advanced socialist nation.

To build the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region well, I think there are three things that are particularly important. First, the Hui people must be well united internally. Eliminate all kinds of prejudices, unite under the overall goal of socialism in the motherland, and unite under the goal of building a prosperous and happy Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Implement democracy in the autonomous region, train cadres, and give play to the enthusiasm of everyone. Only when we are united can we build the autonomous region well.

Second, we must unite well with the people of all ethnic groups. Our Hui people and the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Han people, have lived together for a long time and jointly created our country's history and culture. We once fought together to overthrow our common enemies—the big landlords, the big bourgeoisie, and the oppression of imperialism. Since the founding of New China, we have been jointly struggling to build our great socialist motherland. We cannot imagine that we can build the autonomous region well without the help of the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Han people. We must consolidate the unity of the Hui people and the people of all ethnic groups, and we must learn from the construction experience of the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Han people. Only in this way can we build the autonomous region well.

Third, and most importantly, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Communist Party. Only with the Communist Party can our Hui ethnic group be liberated. Only with the Communist Party can we have the policy of national regional autonomy and the possibility of establishing the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. In the future, only by closely relying on the leadership of the Party can we build a prosperous and happy socialist Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. We should not weaken the leadership of the Communist Party for a moment. Closely relying on the leadership of the Party is our greatest guarantee for the victorious construction of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Our Hui people experienced long-term pain and oppression in old China. With the leadership of the Communist Party, with the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, and with socialism, we have embarked on the road to happiness and light. However, right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Long Yun came to provoke ethnic relations, asking us to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism. They attempted to pull us back into the disasters of old China. How can we not express the greatest indignation at this despicable conspiracy? I will never agree with you to do this, the Hui people across the country will never agree with you to do this, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country will never agree with you to do this. We firmly support the Communist Party, firmly support socialism, and firmly support the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country. All your conspiracies will surely be crushed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

Our great motherland—a big family of unity, friendship, and cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups—will become more prosperous, more consolidated, and advance more rapidly towards socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

### 宁夏回族自治区是我们回族人民理想的家

    宁夏回族自治区是我们回族人民理想的家
    达浦生说：我们回族人民都欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，庆颂这件大喜事。家家户户都衷心的感谢共产党、毛主席和社会主义。紧紧依靠党的领导，就是我们胜利建设宁夏回族自治区的最大保证。
    我完全同意周恩来总理，李先念、薄一波副总理，张鼎丞检察长，董必武院长，彭真副委员长和乌兰夫副总理的各项报告。这些报告实事求是地说明了我们祖国一年来的巨大成就。我听了以后，十分兴奋。
    在大会之前，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话发表了。我完全拥护主席这篇讲话。主席这篇讲话提高了我的认识，使得我更加信心百倍的参加祖国建设社会主义的伟大事业。
    现在我对成立宁夏回族自治区和广西僮族自治区的问题，讲一点我个人的感想。
    我完全同意乌兰夫副总理的报告，完全拥护成立宁夏回族自治区和广西僮族自治区。我们回族人民听到这个消息以后，都欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，庆颂这件回回民族的大喜事。家家户户都衷心的感谢共产党感谢毛主席、感谢社会主义。
    民族区域自治是共产党和毛主席解决中国民族问题的基本政策，是我们少数民族走入繁荣幸福生活的大门。新中国成立以后，在回族聚居的地区已经成立了四个回族自治州，九个回族自治县，一个同其他兄弟民族联合的自治县和十多个回民区，上百个民族乡镇。在推行了民族区域自治政策的地方，政治、经济、文化等各种建设都有很大发展，各民族之间的团结友爱合作也更加巩固。
    就拿甘肃临夏回族自治州来看吧，这个自治州由一九五○年到一九五六年，粮食总产量增加了百分之二百七十九强，造林增加了四千五百多倍，灌溉面积增加了百分之四百二十四，少数民族学生增加了一点五四倍，人民的购买力增加了百分之四百五十六，储蓄增加了七十五倍。民族干部也大批的在实际工作中成长起来。各兄弟民族的关系也更加亲密和睦。如果没有共产党和毛主席的领导，没有民族区域自治政策，怎么能有这样迅速的巨大发展。
    僮族和回族都是中国境内人数较多的少数民族，但是在过去还没有建立省一级的民族自治区。中国共产党在去年二月和十月先后倡议建立回族和僮族的省一级自治区，这样就使得这两个民族同它在祖国大家庭的地位更加适应，更能够充分发挥我们这两个民族建设社会主义祖国的积极性，使我国各民族的团结更加巩固。这是完全符合僮族和回族人民的愿望，完全符合全国各民族利益的。我相信我们的大会是会一致通过这议案的。
    全国回族人民共有三百五十余万，由于历史原因，大部分居住在全国各地。现在选择甘肃境内回族人口较多的宁夏及其附近地区建立回族自治区，是十分适当的。这个区域包括十七个县和两个市，面积有七万七千八百多平方公里，人口有一百七十多万，物产丰富，矿藏很多，包兰铁路将穿越过境。这是很有发展前途的地区，是我们回族人民很理想的家。我完全拥护乌兰夫副总理报告中提出的方案。
    宁夏回族自治区将要成立了，这是我们回族人民千百年来世世代代的理想。我们回族人民和全国兄弟民族人民一样，是勤劳勇敢的，是富于智慧的，只是由于在旧中国长期遭受民族压迫和阶级压迫，才使我们在政治、经济、文化等各方面处于落后状态。我们一定要将自治区建设好。我们一定能在共产党领导下，在全国各族兄弟，特别是汉族兄弟的帮助下，发展我们的政治、经济、文化等各方面建设，逐步的成为先进的社会主义民族。
    要建设好宁夏回族自治区，我想有三件事特别重要。第一，回族内部一定要很好团结。消除各种成见，在祖国的社会主义总目标下团结起来，在建设社会主义的繁荣幸福的宁夏回族自治区的目标下团结起来。在自治区内实行民主，培养干部，发挥每个人的积极性。只有团结好了，才能将自治区建设好。
    第二，要和各族人民很好团结。我们回族人民和各族人民，特别是同汉族人民长期共同生活，共同创造了我国的历史和文化。曾经为推翻我们共同的敌人——大地主、大资产阶级和帝国主义的压迫而共同进行过斗争。新中国成立以后，又共同的为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而进行奋斗。我们不能设想没有各族人民的帮助、特别是没有汉族人民的帮助就能够将自治区建设好。我们一定要巩固回族人民同各族人民的团结，一定要学习各族人民、特别是汉族人民的各方面建设经验。这样才能将自治区建设好。
  第三，也是最重要的，就是要紧紧依靠共产党的领导。有了共产党我们回回民族才得解放。有了共产党才有民族区域自治政策，才有可能建立宁夏回族自治区。今后也只有紧紧依靠党的领导，才能建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的宁夏回族自治区。我们一时一刻都不应削弱共产党的领导。紧紧依靠党的领导，就是我们胜利建设宁夏回族自治区的最大保证。
    我们回族人民在旧中国经历了长期的痛苦和压迫。有了共产党的领导，有了全国各族人民的团结，有了社会主义，我们才走上幸福光明的大道。可是章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、龙云等右派分子却来挑拨民族关系，要我们反对共产党，反对社会主义。企图将我们拉回旧中国的灾难里去。对于这种卑劣的阴谋，怎能不表示最大的愤慨。我决不同意你们这样做，全国回民决不同意你们这样做，全国各族人民也决不会同意你们这样做。我们坚决拥护共产党，坚决拥护社会主义，坚决拥护全国各族人民大团结。你们的一切阴谋，一定会被全国各族人民粉碎的。
    我们伟大的祖国——全国各族人民团结友爱合作的大家庭，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，将更加繁荣，更加巩固，更迅速的向社会主义前进。
