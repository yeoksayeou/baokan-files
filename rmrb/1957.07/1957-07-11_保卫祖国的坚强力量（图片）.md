(From the People's Liberation Army Pictorial)
Since its birth on August 1, 1927, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been thirty years old this year. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it defeated the Japanese imperialist invasion and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary force with a high degree of political consciousness. It has a high degree of organization and discipline, and it has an inseparable relationship with the people. Therefore, it has infinite power in war, and even under conditions of inferior equipment, it can defeat ferocious enemies. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army has followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee: "In the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and the imperialist system exists in the world, our army is still a fighting force." It carries out regularization and modernization to defend the motherland, defend socialist construction, and liberate Taiwan.

    保卫祖国的坚强力量
    中国人民解放军自1927年8月1日诞生以来，到今年已经是三十个年头了。它在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，打垮了日本帝国主义的侵略，推翻了国民党的反动统治。中国人民解放军是具有高度政治觉悟的革命部队，它具有高度的组织性纪律性，它同人民有着血肉不可分的关系，因此它在战争中具有无穷无尽的力量，即使是处于劣势装备的条件下也能打败凶恶的敌人。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，人民解放军遵照着党中央的指示：“在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。”进行正规化现代化建设，以保卫祖国，保卫社会主义建设，解放台湾。
