Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 1st. The Changshou Chemical Plant in Sichuan Province will be gradually expanded into China's only chemical factory capable of producing important products such as chloroprene rubber (a type of synthetic rubber). Construction of some factory buildings for the chloroprene rubber and caustic soda systems has started today.

According to the expansion plan approved by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the first phase of the expansion project includes four major systems: chloroprene rubber, caustic soda, calcium carbide, and plasticizers, with more than 30 individual projects. The civil engineering work for the chloroprene rubber and caustic soda systems that are now under construction is scheduled to be completed in February next year. It is expected that these two systems will be completed and put into production by the end of the second quarter of next year.

The Changshou Chemical Plant has sufficient power from the Longxi River cascade power station to utilize. Therefore, after the completion of the first phase of the expansion project, the plant will continue to be expanded into a first-class comprehensive chemical plant in China.

    向能生产人造橡胶的工厂发展
    四川长寿化工厂部分扩建工程开工
    新华社重庆1日电　四川省长寿化工厂将逐步扩建成我国唯一能生产氯酊橡胶（人造橡胶的一种）等重要产品的化学工厂。氯酊橡胶和烧碱等两个系统的部分厂房工程，今天已经开工。
    根据化学工业部批准的扩建方案，第一期扩建工程共包括氯酊橡胶、烧碱、电石、增塑剂等四大系统，有三十多项单位工程。现在开始施工的氯酊橡胶和烧碱两个系统的土建工程，计划在明年2月完工。预计明年二季度末，这两个系统即可完工投入生产。
    长寿化工厂有龙溪河梯级电站充足的电力可资利用，因此第一期扩建工程完工以后，这个厂还将继续扩建成为我国第一流的综合性化工厂。
