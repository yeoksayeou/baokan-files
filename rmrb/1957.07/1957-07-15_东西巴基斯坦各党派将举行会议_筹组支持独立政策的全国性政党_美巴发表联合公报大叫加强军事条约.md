Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 14th: A meeting of parties from East and West Pakistan will be held in Dhaka in late July, and preparations for the meeting are currently underway.

Last month, the Dhaka meeting of the East Pakistan People's League Council accepted Prime Minister Suhrawardy's pro-Western foreign policy. Maulana Bhashani, chairman of the East Pakistan People's League, who opposed this policy, held discussions with leaders of the National Party after the meeting and suggested convening a meeting of various parties.

The meeting is scheduled to discuss the possibility of establishing an all-Pakistan political party with a broad economic program and advocating an independent foreign policy. Newspaper reports say that National Party members say there is no doubt about the establishment of such a party.

The "Karachi Times" reported that about fifty political leaders from almost every district of West Pakistan are expected to attend the meeting.

Newspaper reports anticipate that the newly formed all-Pakistan political party will be formed by merging the National Party, the Bhashani faction of the People's League, and the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has indicated its support for the upcoming meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Washington News: US President Dwight Eisenhower and Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy issued a joint communiqué on July 13, emphasizing the strengthening of "cooperation" between the two countries.

Suhrawardy arrived in Washington on the 10th for a visit. During these days, he met with Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and Defense Secretary Wilson.

The communiqué first discussed the Near and Middle East issues. In this regard, the communiqué reiterated the cliché of the so-called "international communist threat" and emphasized the determination of the two countries to support and strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty and the Baghdad Pact.

One of the purposes of Suhrawardy's visit to the United States was to request the United States to increase "aid" to Pakistan to solve the financial difficulties encountered by Pakistan in implementing its five-year economic development plan. When discussing this point, the communiqué said that Eisenhower expressed "understanding" of the "serious financial pressures" facing Pakistan, and regarded the United States' large amount of economic and military assistance to Pakistan as "concrete proof" that the United States recognized these difficulties.

Regarding the Kashmir and Indus River water allocation issues, Suhrawardy requested the United States to support Pakistan's position.

Suhrawardy left Washington on the 13th to visit various parts of the United States.

    东西巴基斯坦各党派将举行会议
    筹组支持独立政策的全国性政党
    美巴发表联合公报大叫加强军事条约
    据新华社卡拉奇14日电　东、西巴基斯坦各党派会议将在7月下旬在达卡举行，会议筹备工作目前正在积极进行中。
    上月东巴基斯坦人民联盟理事会达卡会议接受了苏拉瓦底总理的亲西方外交政策。反对这种政策的东巴基斯坦人民联盟主席大毛拉巴沙尼在会议结束以后同国民党领袖们进行了商谈，并且建议召开各党派会议。
    这次会议预定要讨论是否可能成立全巴基斯坦政党的问题，这个党将要有一个广泛的经济纲领，并且主张执行独立的外交政策。报纸消息说，国民党人士说，成立这样一个党是没有疑问的。
    “卡拉奇时报”报道，预料将有来自西巴基斯坦几乎每一个县的大约五十名政界领袖参加这次会议。
    报纸报道，预期新成立的全巴基斯坦政党将由国民党、人民联盟的巴沙尼派和民主党合并组成。民主党已经表示他们支持即将召开的会议。
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底7月13日发表联合公报，强调两国要加强“合作”。
    苏拉瓦底是在10日到华盛顿访问的。他这几天曾经先后同艾森豪威尔、国务卿杜勒斯和国防部长威尔逊等人进行了会谈。
    公报首先谈到中近东问题。在这方面，公报重弹所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的滥调，并且强调两国决心支持和加强东南亚条约和巴格达条约。
    苏拉瓦底这次访问美国的目的之一是要求美国增加对巴基斯坦的“援助”，以解决巴基斯坦执行五年经济发展计划而遇到的财政困难。公报在谈到这一点时说，艾森豪威尔对巴基斯坦面临的“严重的财政压力”表示“了解”，并且以美国对巴基斯坦的大量经济和军事援助作为美国认识到这些困难的“具体证明”。
    关于克什米尔和印度河水量分配问题，苏拉瓦底要求美国支持巴基斯坦的立场。
    苏拉瓦底已经在13日离开华盛顿，到美国各地访问。
