Xinhua News Agency, July 5th Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Lijun reports: To investigate whether there is factual basis for some rightists' claim that "general education and spare-time education have been bungled," the reporter opened some accumulated materials at hand. Many figures show that the general education and spare-time education have not been bungled in the past eight years, but have been done well. General education and spare-time education have not only greatly developed in quantity, but also improved in quality.

Through the active efforts of the People's Government in the past few years, China's general education has greatly developed. Now there are more than 6,700 middle schools and more than 529,000 primary schools across the country, forming a huge school network distributed in various places, basically achieving "every village has a primary school, and every county has a middle school." In addition, a huge network of industrial and agricultural spare-time schools has been formed, distributed from factories and mines to rural areas. The formation of such a school network lays the foundation for further improving the people's cultural level. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, the number of middle school students studying in schools across the country has reached more than 5.16 million; the number of primary school students has reached more than 63 million. The number of middle school students has increased by 593.3% compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of primary school students has increased by 260.2% compared with the early days of liberation. Since 1949, the development speed of primary and secondary schools has been much faster than the development speed during the sixteen years from 1931 to 1946 (the highest year of development) in the Kuomintang era. This speed is unprecedented in Chinese history. Now, there are an average of 8.3 middle school students per thousand people; an average of 10.1 primary school students per hundred people. In particular, the development of senior high schools in 1956 was 301.3% of that in 1952 (the year before the start of the first five-year plan); starting this year, the situation where the needs of colleges and universities to enroll new students cannot be met has been changed. The ratio of this year's high school graduates to the number of college and university enrollments is nearly two to one, which lays the foundation for improving the quality of talent training in colleges and universities in the future.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, general education has vigorously implemented the policy of opening schools to workers and peasants. At present, more than 66% of students in middle schools are from worker and peasant backgrounds, and at least 80% of students in primary schools are from worker and peasant backgrounds. Education in old China was monopolized by landlords and the bourgeoisie. From primary school, especially from middle school to university and studying abroad, the working people had very few opportunities. After liberation, the People's Government set up people's scholarships in secondary and higher schools to overcome the difficulties of children of poor working people in going to school. This is also an unprecedented thing. Such measures have never existed in the most developed countries in education. During the first five-year plan period, the state's expenditure on scholarships accounted for 9.3% of the total expenditure of various undertakings under the Ministry of Education. In 1956, the Ministry of Education also determined the policy of junior high schools facing the countryside, which provided more convenient conditions for the majority of farmers' children to enter school.

Old China was a country with a large number of illiterates. In the past few years, about 20 million workers and peasants have been freed from illiteracy through literacy education; 1.3 million have been raised to the level of senior primary school and junior high school. By 1956, the number of employees, farmers, citizens, and cadres participating in spare-time study across the country reached more than 79 million.

In the past four years, general education has trained more than 368,000 senior high school graduates, more than 2,584,000 junior high school graduates, and more than 13,366,000 senior primary school graduates for the country. In addition to the vast majority of senior high school graduates and most of the junior high school graduates who respectively entered universities and senior secondary schools for further study, some junior high school graduates and the vast majority of senior primary school graduates have invested in industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings. This is a new force in the labor production team. In the future, with the steady development of education at all levels on the basis of national economic development, more primary school, junior high school, and senior high school graduates will be admitted to higher schools every year; at the same time, more and more primary school, junior high school, and senior high school graduates will be put into production labor every year. The good thing of combining knowledge and labor and changing the cultural outlook of the working masses has just begun to be realized in New China.

In order to train qualified middle school teachers, higher normal schools have developed more than eight times than in the early days of liberation, reaching 54 this year. Now almost every province, municipality, and autonomous region has higher normal schools. Most provinces and cities will gradually achieve self-sufficiency in middle school teachers from this year, and the graduates of higher normal schools and the demand for middle school teachers have basically reached a balance this year. This has begun to reverse the situation in previous years where the supply of middle school teachers fell short of demand, and the situation where some middle school teachers were insufficient in higher normal school graduation level will also be improved in the future. Since 1953, in order to improve the quality of education and improve teaching, it has begun to systematically improve the political and professional level of teachers. In the past few years, in addition to participating in political studies, many primary and secondary school teachers have also participated in cultural and professional studies. More than 42,000 middle school teachers across the country have participated in night schools and correspondence courses run by higher normal schools, as well as teacher training colleges run by various provinces and cities. 458,000 primary school teachers participated in spare-time training, and 125,000 participated in rotational training; about 200,000 graduated from spare-time training and rotational training. At present, 24 higher normal schools across the country have established correspondence departments, and 3 higher normal schools have established night schools. A total of 34 teacher training colleges have been established in provinces and cities.

The development of education in ethnic minority areas is faster than in general areas across the country, which is another feature of the education cause in New China. Taking the statistics of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan as an example, Xinjiang has the fastest development of secondary education, with 1956 developing more than 22 times than in the early days of liberation; Guizhou has the fastest development of primary education, with 1956 developing more than 24 times than in the early days of liberation; while the national average growth rate is: 3.9 times for middle schools and 2.6 times for primary schools. At present, there are already more than 233,900 middle school students and more than 3,150,000 primary school students from ethnic minorities across the country. According to the statistics of the above five regions, there are already more than 80,000 ethnic minority middle school students studying in specially established ethnic minority schools, an increase of 200.3% compared with 1953; there are more than 1.6 million primary school students, an increase of 114.5% compared with 1953.

Since 1953, according to the requirements of teachers in various places, the Ministry of Education has organized manpower to re-compile new textbooks that are more suitable for the actual construction of the country in accordance with the principles of socialist education. At present, 127 kinds of textbooks and 100 kinds of teaching reference books in 56 subjects used in primary and secondary schools and normal schools across the country are all newly compiled or re-compiled in recent years. Including books for industrial and agricultural spare-time primary and secondary schools, a total of 388 kinds were edited and published by the summer of 1957. Together with 57 kinds of teaching outlines for various subjects, there are 445 kinds. According to incomplete statistics, from the summer of 1953 to the present, the number of teaching outlines and textbooks for various subjects in primary and secondary schools, normal schools, and industrial and agricultural spare-time schools published across the country has reached 1.245 billion copies. The newly compiled and re-compiled textbooks pay attention to the scientificity, systematicness, and ideological nature of each subject, and can better educate the younger generation with socialist ideas. At present, all subjects in primary and secondary schools and normal schools have teaching outlines and textbooks, and most of them have teaching reference books. This plays a great role in improving the quality of education. The newly compiled textbooks still have shortcomings such as deep level, heavy weight, and inappropriate selection of materials, which need to be improved urgently. (Attached picture)

### 右派分子说“办糟了”的根据在哪里？  普通教育  业余教育大发展

    右派分子说“办糟了”的根据在哪里？
    普通教育  业余教育大发展
    新华社5日讯　新华社记者张丽君报道：为了查考某些右派分子所谓“普通教育、业余教育办糟了”的说法有没有事实根据，记者打开手边积累的一些资料，很多数字说明八年来普通教育、业余教育事业不是办糟了，而是办好了。普通教育、业余教育事业不仅在数量上有很大发展，而且在质量上也有所提高。
    经过几年来人民政府的积极努力，我国的普通教育事业是有很大发展的。现在全国已经有六千七百多所中学，五十二万九千多所小学，形成一个巨大的学校网，分布在各地，基本上达到村村有小学，县县有中学。此外，还形成了一个巨大的工农业余学校网，从厂矿分布到农村。像这样一个学校网的形成，就为进一步提高人民的文化水平打下了基础。据教育部的统计，目前全国在校学习的中学生已经达到五百一十六万多人；小学生达到六千三百多万人。中学生比解放初期增加了593.3％，小学生比解放初期增加了260.2％。1949年以来，中小学的发展速度比国民党时期1931年到1946年（发展的最高年份）这十六年时间的发展速度还要快得多。这种速度是中国历史上从来没有过的事情。现在，平均每千人中有八点三个中学生；平均每百人中有十点一个小学生。特别是高级中学的发展，1956年为1952年（第一个五年计划开始前一年）的301.3％；从今年起开始改变了不能满足高等学校招收新生需要的情况，今年的高中毕业生和高等学校招生数的比例将近二比一，这为今后提高高等学校培养人才的质量打下了基础。
    从1949年建国以来，普通教育大力贯彻了学校向工农开门的方针。目前中学里已经有66％以上的学生是工农成份，小学里工农成份的学生至少占80％以上。旧中国的教育是为地主资产阶级所垄断的。从小学起，特别是从中学到大学和出国留学，劳动人民是很少有份的。解放以后，人民政府在中等以上学校设有人民助学金，以克服贫苦劳动人民子女上学的困难。这也是史无前例的事情。在教育事业最发达的国家里也从来没有过这样的措施。第一个五年计划期间，国家用于助学金的经费占教育部所属各项事业费总额的9.3％。1956年教育部还确定了初中面向农村的方针，这又为广大农民子弟入学提供了更方便的条件。
    旧中国是个文盲众多的国家。几年来，广大的工农劳动群众经过识字教育，摆脱文盲状态的已经有二千万人左右；提高到高小和初中程度的已经有一百三十万人。到1956年，全国职工、农民、市民和干部参加业余学习的人数达到了七千九百多万人。
    过去四年，普通教育为国家培养了高中毕业生三十六万八千多人，初中毕业生二百五十八万四千多人，高小毕业生一千三百三十六万六千多人。除绝大多数的高中毕业生和大部分的初中毕业生分别升入高等学校和高级中等学校继续学习以外，有一部分初中毕业生和绝大多数的高小毕业生都投入了工农业生产和其他建设事业。这是劳动生产队伍里的新的生力军。今后随着各级教育在国民经济发展的基础上稳步地发展，每年将有更多的小学、初中、高中的毕业生升学；同时每年又会有越来越多的小学、初中、高中的毕业生投入生产劳动。知识和劳动相结合，改变劳动群众的文化面貌的好事情在新中国才开始实现。
    为了培养合格的中学教师，高等师范学校较解放初期发展了八倍多，今年已经达到五十四所。现在几乎每个省市和自治区都有高等师范学校。多数省市从今年起将逐步做到中学师资的自足自给，今年的高等师范学校的毕业生和中学师资的需求已经基本上达到平衡。这就开始扭转了以往几年中学师资供不应求的情况，部分中学师资不足高等师范毕业水平的情况，今后也将随着有所改善。1953年以来，为了提高教育质量、改进教学工作，开始有计划地提高教师的政治和业务水平。几年来，除参加政治学习外，还有很多中小学教师参加文化业务学习。全国中学教师参加高等师范学校举办的夜校和函授，以及参加各省市举办的教师进修学院学习的，有四万二千多人。小学教师参加业余进修的有四十五万八千多人，参加轮训的有十二万五千人；经过业余进修和轮训毕业的达到二十万人左右。目前，全国有二十四所高等师范学校举办了函授部，三所高等师范学校举办了夜校。省市举办的教师进修学院共三十四所。
    少数民族地区的教育事业比全国一般地区发展得快，是新中国教育事业的又一特点。以内蒙古、新疆、广西、贵州、云南五个地区的统计来看，中学教育发展最快的是新疆，1956年较解放初期发展了二十二倍多；小学教育以贵州发展最快，1956年比解放初期发展了二十四倍多；而全国平均的增长速度：中学是三点九倍，小学是二点六倍。目前，全国少数民族的中学生已经有二十三万三千九百多人，少数民族小学生有三百一十五万多人。以上述五个地区的统计，在专设的少数民族学校里学习的少数民族中学生，已经有八万多人，比1953年增长了200.3％；小学生有一百六十多万人，比1953年增长了114.5％。
    1953年起，教育部根据各地教师的要求，组织人力按照社会主义教育的原则，重新编写比较适合于国家建设实际的新的教科书。现在，全国中小学、师范学校所用的五十六门学科的教科书一百二十七种和教学参考书一百种，都是这几年新编或重编的。连同工农业余中小学用书在内，到1957年夏季共编辑出版了三百八十八种。加上各门学科的教学大纲五十七种，就有四百四十五种。据不完全统计，从1953年夏到现在，全国出版的中小学、师范和工农业余学校的各科教学大纲、教科书的数量，达十二亿四千五百多万册。新编和重编的教科书，注意了各学科的科学性、系统性和思想性，能够更好地以社会主义思想教育青少年一代。现在中小学和师范学校各科都有教学大纲和教科书，并且多半都有教学参考书。这对提高教育质量有很大作用。新编的教材目前还有程度深、份量重、选材不恰当等缺点，急待改进。（附图片）
