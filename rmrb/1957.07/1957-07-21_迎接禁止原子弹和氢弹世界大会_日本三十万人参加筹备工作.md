    Welcoming the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
    300,000 People in Japan Participate in Preparatory Work
    (Dispatch) According to Japanese newspapers, the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is scheduled to be held in Tokyo from August 6th to 16th, and preparations for the conference are actively underway.
    This conference will be held amidst the upsurge of peace-loving people worldwide opposing hydrogen bomb tests. It will be broader in scope than the first and second conferences held in Hiroshima in 1955 and Nagasaki in 1956. It is estimated that representatives from twenty countries will participate in the conference.
    The initiators of the conference are nineteen prominent Japanese figures and twenty prominent figures from various countries around the world. Among them are Oparin (Soviet Union, biologist), Infeld (Poland, Nobel Prize winner), Chaplin (UK, film artist), Yukawa Hideki (Japan, Nobel Prize winner), and Katayama Tetsu (Japan, former Socialist Party cabinet prime minister). An international preparatory committee composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Japan, India, Burma, Australia, and Ceylon has been formed. Shi Ruzhang, the Chinese representative to the conference's international preparatory committee, arrived in Tokyo on July 18th. The conference will discuss how to expose the dangers of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests and what kind of unified international action should be taken to unite the people of all countries to fight for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a national conference on July 3rd to discuss the specific preparations for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and decided to hold countless peace rallies of varying sizes throughout Japan before and after the opening of the conference on August 6th. Activists in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs throughout Japan have been launching activities since the end of June to raise funds for the conference. In front of many stations in Tokyo, workers, students, and housewives holding signs saying "Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" frequently appear, soliciting donations from pedestrians. It is estimated that more than 300,000 people throughout Japan have participated in this activity.

    The "Student Federation" of Tokyo is raising funds at train stations in the city for the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.
