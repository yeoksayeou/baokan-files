Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 17th. The typhoon in the South China Sea made landfall last night between Haifeng County and Bao'an County in eastern Guangdong with a force of level 10. Before dawn this morning, it swept across the south of Guangzhou city with a force of level 8, heading towards the upper reaches of the West River. The wind force has now weakened to level 6.

Preliminary estimates indicate that eight people have died, one fishing boat has sunk, and dozens more are missing. Haifeng County, which was affected by the center of the typhoon, had more than 30 houses collapsed, and approximately 20% of the unharvested ripe rice was lost.

In the two to three days before the typhoon made landfall, the relevant counties organized more than 300,000 farmers to rush the harvesting of rice, and more than 30,000 military officers, government officials, and urban workers went to the countryside to participate in typhoon defense work. The navy and shipping departments along the coast sent warships and ships to sea to notify fishing boats to return to port to take shelter from the wind. Four counties also helped more than 1,400 households with weak houses to relocate and avoid the typhoon. After the disaster, leading departments at all levels are continuing to deeply understand the disaster situation and handle the aftermath.

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th. The Central Meteorological Research Institute issued a typhoon cancellation alert and heavy rain forecast at 12:00 noon on July 17th:

The typhoon in the South China Sea landed in the area west of Shantou at 23:00 last night and continued to move in a northwest-westerly direction. At 8:00 this morning, it had moved to about 100 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou. The typhoon has now weakened, and the threat of this typhoon has been basically eliminated. In the next 24 hours, affected by the residual force of the typhoon, Guangdong and eastern Guangxi will still have heavy rain, and local areas will have torrential rain; the northern part of the South China Sea will still have southerly winds of level 5 or 6, which will continue to weaken later. In the next 24 hours, northern and central Henan, and southwestern Shandong will have torrential rain; southern Hebei, eastern Shandong, eastern Jilin, southeastern Heilongjiang, and northeastern Sichuan will have heavy rain or torrential rain.

    广东渡过台风侵袭
    警报解除一些地区将有暴雨
    新华社广州17日电  南海台风昨晚以十级风力于广东东部海丰县至宝安县间登陆，今晨黎明前，以八级风力在广州市南部掠过，吹向西江上游。目前风力已减弱至六级。
    初步估计：有八人死亡，一只渔船沉没，还有数十只下落不明。受中心台风波及的海丰县塌房三十余间，未割的熟稻约损失二成。
    台风登陆前的两三天，有关的几个县组织了三十多万农民抢割稻谷，三万多名部队官兵、机关干部和城镇工人下乡参加防风工作。沿海的海军和航运部门都派出舰艇和船只出海通知渔船回港避风。有四个县还帮助一千四百多家房屋不牢固的住户迁居避风。灾后，各级领导部门正继续深入了解灾情，处理善后。
    新华社17日讯  中央气象科学研究所17日中午十二点发布台风解除警报及暴雨预告：
    南海的台风已于昨晚二十三点在汕尾偏西地区登陆，并继续向西北偏西方向移动，今晨八点已移到了广州西北方约一百公里左右的地方。目前台风已经减弱，此次台风威胁已经基本解除。未来二十四小时内，受台风残余势力影响，广东及广西东部尚有大雨，局部地区有暴雨；南海北部海面尚有五、六级的偏南风，以后将继续减弱。未来二十四小时内，河南北部和中部、山东西南部将有暴雨；河北南部、山东东部、吉林东部、黑龙江东南部、四川东北部将有大雨或暴雨。
