Supporting Rural Drought Resistance from All Directions
Jiangxi Farmers Will Not Cease Fighting Until They Conquer the Drought

(Our Nanchang Dispatch, July 29th) Since May, Jiangxi Province has experienced little rainfall in various areas, with over forty days without rain in Nanchang, Ji'an, and other regions. As the drought intensified, the enthusiasm of the masses for drought resistance has grown daily. Currently, over 1.77 million cadres and civilians across the province are participating in the drought resistance struggle, having saved over 5.55 million mu of early and mid-season rice fields.

During the drought resistance effort, many responsible Party comrades worked alongside the masses, personally directing and participating in the operations, starting before dawn and continuing until after dusk. Zhao Yingzhou, Secretary of the Dongxiang County Party Committee, and Chen Anfu, Deputy Secretary, led cadres from the county Party organs to the most severely affected communes, such as Luzhou and Gongtian, on July 10th, joining the commune members in the drought resistance struggle. Many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have stood on the front lines of the drought resistance effort. At the initiative and leadership of the Communist Youth League members, the Fengshan Agricultural Cooperative in Jishui County organized a 48-member youth shock brigade, using a 14-person water relay to carry water over the hills, thus relieving the threat of drought to the early rice crop.

The drought resistance struggle in the rural areas of Jiangxi has not only received the leadership and assistance of the Party and government but also the strong support from all directions. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various locations have also participated in the drought resistance struggle with a fighting spirit. Zhou Lianggui, Commander of the Nanchang Military Sub-district, personally led officers and soldiers in the Bayi Cooperative in Nanchang County, continuously fighting the drought for three days. The Shanggao County Woodcraft Handicraft Cooperative dispatched over 300 carpenters to various agricultural cooperatives to help farmers rush to repair drought resistance tools day and night. Rice processing plants and power plants in counties such as Xiushui and De'an also extracted a group of technicians to go to the countryside to help farmers repair pumping machines, ensuring that none of the twenty pumping machines in these two counties experienced any failures. In addition, the health departments in Shanggao County organized 78 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to go to the countryside with medicine for mobile medical treatment; the commercial departments also organized 127 peddlers to go to the countryside to supply summer medicines and straw hats; the banks also allocated an additional 50,000 yuan in loans to help agricultural cooperatives repair drought resistance tools and purchase pumping machines; and the transportation departments also made every effort to ensure that drought resistance tools were transported to the places where they were needed in a timely manner. All of this has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for drought resistance. Currently, the drought resistance struggle is being carried out in depth in various places, and the broad masses of cadres and people have unanimously proposed: we will not cease fighting until we conquer the drought!

    从四面八方支援农村抗旱
    江西农民不战胜干旱不收兵
    本报南昌29日电　江西省自5月以来，各地少雨，南昌、吉安等专区四十多天没有雨。随着旱情的发展，群众抗旱热情日益高涨。现全省参加抗旱斗争的干部群众，已达一百七十七万多人，先后救活早、中稻田五百五十五万多亩。
    在抗旱中，许多党的负责同志和群众一道，披星戴月，亲临前线指挥并参与作战。中共东乡县委书记赵瀛洲、副书记陈按福率领县委机关干部，在7月10日到受旱最严重的潞洲、弓田等社，和社员们一道投入抗旱斗争。许多共产党员、共青团员都站在抗旱斗争的最前线。吉水县枫山农业社在共青团员的倡议和带动下，组织了一个四十八人的青年突击队，用十四人递水车车水过岗，解除了早稻的旱灾威胁。
    江西农村的抗旱斗争，不仅有党和政府的领导和帮助，而且也受到来自四面八方的大力支援。各地驻军部队的解放军官兵，也以战斗的姿态，参加了抗旱斗争。南昌军分区司令员周良贵同志亲率军官和士兵，在南昌县八一社连续抗旱三天。上高县木器手工业合作社抽调了三百多名木工到各农业社帮助农民日夜赶修抗旱工具。修水、德安等县的加工米厂、电厂还抽出一批技术工人，下乡帮助农民检修抽水机，使这两县的二十台抽水机从未发生故障。此外，上高县卫生部门还组织了七十八名中医带药下乡巡回医疗；商业部门也组织了一百二十七个货郎担下乡供应暑天药品和草帽；银行还增拨了五万元贷款解决农业社修理抗旱工具和添置抽水机的费用；交通运输部门也尽量使抗旱工具及时运到需要的地点。所有这一切，都大大鼓舞了群众的抗旱热情，目前各地抗旱斗争正深入开展，广大干部和群众都一致提出：不战胜干旱，决不收兵！
