Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 29th: In Hunan Province, where drought is severely threatening, scenes like these are appearing in many places: workers are installing water pumps, and farmers are digging irrigation canals alongside them; workers are sweating and pumping water to irrigate the fields, while farmers are building shelters and delivering tea to the workers. Many drought-stricken farmlands have been freed from drought through the help of the workers.

According to statistics from the Hunan Provincial Department of Industry, more than thirty factories and enterprises have now dispatched workers, carrying water pumps, gas engines, electric motors, and fire engines to drought-stricken areas to join the farmers in the fight against drought. Workers who remain in the factories to maintain production also actively help farmers fight drought in nearby areas during their spare time.

Workers in various places have shown great enthusiasm and initiative in supporting farmers in the fight against drought. In addition to dispatching six water pumps to support the severely drought-stricken areas of Changning and Hengnan counties, workers at the state-owned Shuikoushan Mining Bureau have also formed a drought-fighting team of more than two hundred people to fight drought for the agricultural cooperatives near the mine. Workers at the Xiangnan 217 Exploration Team not only allocate two hours of drilling water every day to irrigate farmland but also helped farmers connect a water pipe more than 1,300 meters long near a nearby mine shaft to draw water from the mine to irrigate the fields. Wang Jinlong, a national advanced producer and fitter at the local state-owned Changsha Water Pump Factory, worked for two days and two nights without rest while installing water pumps for farmers. A water pump he installed has been operating for four days and has rescued more than three thousand mu of drought-stricken land. In the drought-fighting teams that leave the local state-owned Matian and Yangmeishan coal mines every Sunday, there are not only workers but also the secretary of the CCP Committee and many family members of the workers.

    帮助农民抗旱
    据新华社长沙29日电  在旱灾严重威胁的湖南省，许多地方出现了这样的场面：工人在装抽水机，农民在一边开引水道；工人们在挥汗车水灌田，农民在为工人搭凉棚、送茶水。不少受旱农田，经职工们帮助灌溉，已经摆脱了干旱。
    据湖南省工业厅统计，现在有三十多个工厂企业，抽出职工，携带抽水机、煤气机、电动机和救火车等设备，分别到干旱地区同农民一起投入抗旱斗争；在工厂坚持生产的职工，也利用空闲的时间，在邻近地区积极帮助农民抗旱。
    各地职工在支援农民抗旱中表现得非常热情积极。国营水口山矿务局职工除了抽调六台抽水机支援附近常宁、衡南两县的重旱区以外，还成立了一支二百多人的抗旱队为矿山附近的农业社抗旱。湘南二一七勘探队职工除了把钻探用水每天分出两小时灌到农田里以外，还帮助农民在附近矿井边接了一条一千三百多公尺长的水管，把矿井下的水引出灌田。全国先进生产者、地方国营长沙水泵厂钳工王金龙在为农民安装抽水机时，两天两晚没有休息，他安装的一台抽水机开动了四天，就抢救出三千多亩受旱田。在地方国营马田、杨梅山煤矿每星期日出发的抗旱队伍中，不仅有职工，而且还有中共党委书记和许多职工家属。
