    A Communist Party Member on an Island
    Lu Gong, you once traversed the Taihang Mountains and crossed the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. The motherland needed you to go to the island, and you braved the storms to cross the ocean. The fishermen grabbed you and called, "Comrade!" You cheered, "Our fisherman brothers!" Thousands of red flags rose on the sea, even more beautiful than the morning glow... In the storms, you blew the conch shell, and the fishermen's hands fought down the raging waves. In the darkness, you lit the lighthouse, the eyes of the fishing boats shining brightly.

    海岛上一位共产党员
    路工你曾经踏遍太行，飞渡了黄河、长江。祖国需要你去岛上，你迎着风暴跨过海洋。渔民拉住你叫：“同志”，你欢呼着：“我们渔民兄弟！”海上升起了千万红旗，比早霞还要美丽……暴风雨中你把海螺吹响，渔民的双手斗倒了恶浪。黑夜里你点亮了灯塔，渔船的眼睛闪闪发亮。你头顶太阳走遍群岛，家家门口有你的脚印。你肩披星星去找鱼群，条条桅杆上飞绕着笑声……
