Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 26th: According to reports in the "Al-Nour" and "Al-Jamahir" newspapers on July 25th, the American military attachés stationed in countries surrounding Syria have been intensely engaged in certain activities recently.

The newspapers said that these attachés frequently visit Syria and travel between Damascus and Beirut. It has been noted that the U.S. Army Attaché in Syria, accompanied by a U.S. Air Force Attaché, left Damascus for Beirut on the morning of July 24th and returned in the evening. Sources from Beirut say that the two met with certain Syrians there.

"Al-Nour" stated that American military personnel travel between Syria and Lebanon almost daily and are in contact with Syrians living abroad. These Americans prefer to personally deliver intelligence about Syria rather than use the telephone.

    美国军人奔跑于大马士革和贝鲁特之间
    加紧进行反叙利亚的活动
    新华社大马士革26日电　据“光明报”和“群众报”7月25日报道，驻在叙利亚周围各国的美国武官们最近正在紧张地进行某种活动。
    报纸说，这些武官常常到叙利亚停留，而且来往于大马士革和贝鲁特之间。据有人注意到，美国驻叙利亚陆军武官7月24日早晨在一个美国空军武官陪同下离开大马士革前往贝鲁特，在晚上又回到这里。来自贝鲁特的消息说，他们两人曾会晤了那里的某些叙利亚人。
      “光明报”说，美国军事人员几乎每天都来往于叙利亚和黎巴嫩之间，并且同住在国外的叙利亚人接触。这些美国人宁愿亲自传递叙利亚的情报而不愿利用电话。
