Before this conference, I had the opportunity to visit the hometowns of overseas Chinese in Fujian Province, which made me realize that the people in the hometowns, including the families of overseas Chinese, are embracing socialist labor with boundless enthusiasm. This vivid reality is deeply touching. Moreover, it further embodies the firm determination of overseas Chinese and their families to follow Chairman Mao on the road to socialist happiness. In particular, the people of Xiamen, who are at the forefront of national defense, work and study peacefully under air raid alarms and artillery fire. They have also achieved considerable success in the struggle against the blockade over the past few years, which is worthy of our admiration and learning.

Overseas Chinese Affairs Work Still Needs to be Improved

Over the past few years, the motherland's care and consideration for overseas Chinese has been meticulous and far-reaching. Significant achievements have also been made in overseas Chinese affairs work! However, it is undeniable that some shortcomings exist in this complex, detailed, and very arduous work. Now, I will comprehensively present some reflections from overseas Chinese abroad and those encountered in hometowns and among new and old returned overseas Chinese, for the reference of relevant parties in improving their work.

Overseas Chinese Affairs Agencies Should Have More Contact with Ordinary Returned Overseas Chinese

(1) Due to the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction, overseas Chinese abroad increasingly yearn for a prosperous and strong motherland. In recent years, the number of those returning to the country for travel, visits, and seeing friends and relatives has increased. When they return to the motherland, they generally regard the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and local overseas Chinese affairs bureaus and sections as their home. However, local and central overseas Chinese affairs agencies have not seen the development of the situation and have not done a good job of contacting the compatriots who have returned from afar. According to the reflections of overseas Chinese, except for members of sightseeing groups, ordinary returned overseas Chinese generally find it relatively difficult to contact overseas Chinese affairs cadres and therefore do not feel a sense of closeness. It is hoped that local and central overseas Chinese affairs agencies will have more contact with returned overseas Chinese in the future in order to understand their lives and demands in many ways, so that they can better serve the masses of overseas Chinese.

In addition, as a bridge connecting overseas Chinese at home and abroad, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese lacks sufficient recognition and assistance from individual local party and government organs. Therefore, it has not been able to fully play a positive role in serving overseas Chinese. This should be brought to the attention of relevant departments.

Agricultural Cooperatives in Overseas Chinese Hometowns Still Need to Strengthen Leadership

(2) Guangdong and Fujian are located on the front lines of national defense, with limited land and a large population. Moreover, agricultural cooperatives have only recently been established, and farming methods are backward. Therefore, the difficulties existing in the rural areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces are more numerous than in other provinces. According to the reflections of ordinary returned overseas Chinese, some cadres of agricultural cooperatives lack farming experience but are unwilling to humbly learn from local experienced farmers, absorb their years of experience, and properly mobilize forces to develop production efficiency. This has added some man-made errors to the original difficulties. Therefore, the lives of the people in overseas Chinese hometowns are still quite difficult in some areas. According to my understanding, this situation exists in Huian, Fujian. For example, in one area of Huian, in order to expand the cultivated area, a seawall was built along the coast, increasing the arable land by more than 400 mu. Experienced local farmers believed that the newly added arable land contained saline soil and could not be used for growing crops for one or two years. Therefore, they planted many small crops as fuel. However, just as these small crops had grown to about a foot long, the rural cadres suddenly received a task. Without studying it, they cut down the small crops and planted sweet potatoes instead. As a result, the farmers lacked the necessary fuel, and the sweet potatoes could not grow because the soil was unsuitable. The cooperative wasted more than 10,000 work points, causing losses to the cooperative and arousing many complaints from the farmers. The existence of this situation is serious. It is hoped that relevant departments will take effective measures to promote cooperation between cadres and experienced farmers and improve farming methods. At the same time, it is also necessary to further strengthen the organization of cooperatives, improve the accounting capabilities of cooperatives, and ensure that the complex accounts of cooperatives are in order. This will increase the enthusiasm of farmers and greatly help improve the lives of people in overseas Chinese hometowns.

Do Not Overly Take Care of the Children of Returned Overseas Chinese

(3) In recent years, the number of returned overseas Chinese students has been very large. The vast majority of them have been able to study with their domestic classmates, acquiring rich new knowledge and new technologies. Some have even gloriously taken up positions serving the socialist cause of the motherland. However, a small number of them were previously infected with various bad habits and lacked enthusiasm for learning. After returning to the country, the responsible departments, in order to take care of the special circumstances of overseas Chinese children, did not take strict supervision measures and provided excessive care, which turned into excessive indulgence, causing this part of the students to remain unchanged in their bad habits. Although this small part accounts for only a few percent, the absolute number is considerable among the thousands of returned overseas Chinese children each year. These students' free and undisciplined behavior has aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of domestic students and anxiety among the parents of overseas students. Therefore, there is an urgent need for relevant parties to quickly improve measures, make appropriate arrangements, and promote these students to embark on the path of normal learning.

Xiamen's Foreign Trade Has Great Prospects and Should Be Included in the National Foreign Trade Plan

(4) Xiamen is the economic and cultural center of Fujian Province and one of China's important ports for foreign trade. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also mostly regard Xiamen as an important gateway for entering and leaving the country. Now, Xiamen is located on the front line of national defense, and the employment problem has not yet been reasonably resolved. However, the people of Xiamen have made many contributions in the struggle against the blockade over the past few years and have created many conditions for the development of Xiamen's foreign trade. Xiamen has always been a distribution center for Fujian's native products, including canned food, medicinal materials, tea, and handicrafts, which have a good reputation and a broad market in Southeast Asia and other places. If Xiamen's foreign trade is developed, it will surely receive strong support from overseas Chinese scattered in Southeast Asia. This is of great significance for revitalizing the economy of overseas Chinese hometowns and helping to solve some employment problems. According to the reflections of the people of Xiamen, the central Ministry of Foreign Trade has not paid enough attention to Xiamen's foreign trade in the past. Therefore, it is hoped that the central foreign trade department will study this matter and include Xiamen's foreign trade in the plan and appropriately expand and develop it, which will also be beneficial to the prosperity of the national economy.

Taking the Socialist Road is the Common Wish of the Broad Masses of Overseas Chinese

I completely agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1956 national final accounts and the 1957 national budget, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan. From these reports, I deeply feel that the motherland's socialist construction is great and the future is infinitely bright. After repeated and in-depth discussions in the group, we affirm that the content of the three reports is completely in line with reality, neither exaggerating achievements nor concealing the difficulties and shortcomings that exist in the process of progress. This fully demonstrates that our country's socialist construction has infinite confidence. The rapid development of the motherland and the hard work of the people of the motherland have also given boundless encouragement to millions of overseas Chinese. Our hearts are forever linked with the people of the motherland, let us jointly make greater efforts for the happier future of the motherland.

As an overseas Chinese representative, let me talk about the common feelings of overseas Chinese abroad. In the old society, the ancestors of overseas Chinese crossed the seas and oceans, endured hardship and suffering, and suffered discrimination and oppression. In just eight years, the face of the motherland has been completely renewed, its international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and overseas Chinese have also raised their heads abroad and live in harmony with friendly people in their places of residence. The strong and unified China that overseas Chinese have longed for for many years has finally achieved this ideal wish today. Therefore, millions of overseas Chinese wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and march towards the broad road of socialism. Anything that violates this common wish of overseas Chinese is deeply hated by the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

I just returned from Burma and saw the people of the motherland enthusiastically discussing how to handle the contradictions among the people, with people from all walks of life providing opinions and helping the government to improve its work, giving full play to the initiative of democracy. I felt very excited and felt that our motherland is truly great! Such a method of broadly opening up avenues of speech and soliciting opinions is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. This makes us deeply realize that our people's government has confidence and methods. However, it is distressing that a few ambitious individuals holding important government positions, such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, took this opportunity to forget the importance entrusted to them by the people and spread fallacies that violated the wishes of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese, in an attempt to weaken the country's leadership and achieve personal goals. Without a doubt, these fallacies cause pain to those who are close to us and please those who hate us, and patriotic overseas Chinese abroad absolutely cannot agree with them. We firmly support the people of the motherland in severely refuting these vicious remarks and distinguishing between right and wrong with a solemn attitude. This also shows that the socialist cause supported by the broadest masses of the people will surely achieve greater victories day by day, and the great unity of the Chinese people on the basis of socialism will surely be consolidated day by day.

It should be pointed out that the vicious fallacies of rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Chu Anping will be fully utilized by reactionary newspapers and periodicals around the world to bewilder overseas Chinese. However, the broad masses of overseas Chinese standing under the banner of patriotism, supporting the socialist construction of the motherland, and supporting the peaceful foreign policy of the central People's Government will not waver in the slightest. On the contrary, the fact that the people of the motherland have spared no effort in exposing the true faces of the rightist elements, especially the publication of Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," has not only increased our ability to distinguish between right and wrong and strengthened our great confidence in the socialist construction of the motherland, but also played a huge educational role in expanding the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese. We believe that overseas Chinese abroad will surely unite more closely around the motherland and contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    广大爱国华侨拥护祖国的社会主义建设
    徐四民表明华侨的愿望，并提出改进侨务工作的建议
    这次大会之前，我有机会到福建省华侨家乡去走走，使我体会到侨乡人民包括侨眷、侨属，对于进行社会主义劳动，抱着无限热情，这种生动的事实，令人深深感动。而且更加体现了华侨、侨眷，决心跟着毛主席走向社会主义的幸福道路，是坚定不移的。特别是处在国防前线的厦门人民，在飞机警报和炮声之下，安然地工作和学习，几年来在反封锁的斗争中也取得不少的成就，这是值得我们钦佩和学习的。
    侨务工作还需要加以改进
    这几年来，祖国对于华侨的关怀和照顾是无微不至和无远弗届的。侨务工作也取得了很大的成绩！但是，无庸讳言，在这复杂细致而又十分艰巨的侨务工作中，也存在一些缺点。现在，把国外华侨的一些反映以及在侨乡和新旧归侨接触到的，综合地提出来，以为有关方面改进工作的参考。
    侨务机构要多接触普通归侨
    （一）由于祖国社会主义建设取得了辉煌的成就，国外华侨向往日益繁荣富强的祖国，年来回国旅行参观、探亲问友的日益增加，他们回到了祖国，一般是把侨委会和各地侨务局、侨务科，当成他们之家。但是地方和中央侨务机构，没有看到形势的发展，对千里归来的侨胞，没有做到很好的联系和接触，根据侨胞的反映，除了观光团员以外，一般普通归侨是比较不容易接触到侨务干部，因而没有亲切的感觉，希望各地及中央的侨务机构，今后更多地接触归侨，以便多方面的了解他们的生活和要求，也才会更好地为侨胞大众服务。
    此外，作为沟通国内外华侨的桥梁——归国华侨联谊会，个别地区党政机关对于侨联的认识和帮助都很不够，因而未能充分发挥为侨胞服务的积极作用，这是要引起有关部门加以注意的。
    侨乡农业社还需要加强领导
    （二）广东、福建地处国防前线，地少人多，加以农业合作社建立不久，耕种方法落后，因此广东、福建二省的农村存在的困难比较其他省份为多，根据一般归侨反映，有些农业合作社的干部，对于农作经验比较缺少，但又不肯虚心向当地的老农学习，吸收老农多年以来业务经验，好好调动力量，发展生产效率，以致在原有困难的基础上加上一些人为的错误。因此，侨乡人民的生活，有一部分还是相当苦的。据我了解，福建的惠安就存在着这种情况。例如惠安有一个地区，为了扩大耕种面积，在沿海地带筑了一条海堤，增加了四百多亩耕地，当地有经验的老农认为新增加的耕地，土壤带有咸质，在一两年之内是不能种农作物的，因而栽种了很多作为燃料的小作物。但是正当这些小作物长了一尺多长的时候，农村干部忽然接到一个任务，未加研究，即将小作物砍掉，改种地瓜，结果农民少了必需的燃料，而地瓜也因土壤不适宜不能生长，合作社白白花了一万多工分，造成合作社的损失，引起农民不少怨言。这种情况的存在是严重的，希望有关部门采取有效措施，促使干部和老农合作，改进耕种方法。同时还要进一步加强合作社的组织，提高合作社的会计能力，使合作社复杂的账目有条不紊。这样，才会提高农民的积极性，对于提高侨乡人民的生活是有很大帮助的。
    对归国华侨子弟照顾不要过分
    （三）几年来归国华侨学生为数很多，其中绝大多数已能和祖国的同学共同学习，取得丰富的新知识、新技术，有的甚至已光荣走上为祖国社会主义事业服务的岗位上；但是还有少数的一部分，过去沾染各种恶习惯，学习兴致不高，回国之后，负责部门为了照顾华侨子弟的特殊情况，没有采取严厉的督促，过分的照顾，变成了过分的放纵，而使这一部分学生的恶劣习性仍然不改。这一小部分在比例上虽只是百分之几的少数，但是在每年数以千计的归国华侨子弟中的绝对数字就有相当的人数了。这些学生自由散漫行动，已引起国内多数同学的不满，也引起国外同学家长们的不安。因此迫切要求有关方面，迅速改善措施，适当安排，促使这一些学生走上正常学习的道路。
    厦门对外贸易大有前途应纳入国家对外贸易计划
    （四）厦门为福建省的经济和文化的中心，也是我国对外贸易的重要口岸之一；南洋的华侨也多以厦门为出入国的重要门户。现在，厦门地处国防最前线，就业问题，还未能达到合理解决，但是厦门人民几年来在反封锁的斗争中，作出了不少的贡献，对发展厦门的对外贸易也创造了不少条件，厦门本来就是福建土特产的集散地，其中罐头食品、药材、茶叶及手工艺品在东南亚等地，信用素著，市场广阔，如果发展厦门对外贸易，一经号召，一定会得到散布在东南亚的华侨的大力支持。这对于繁荣侨乡经济，帮助解决一部分就业问题，是有很大的意义。根据厦门人民的反映，中央对外贸易部，过去对厦门的对外贸易重视不够，因此希望中央对外贸易部门，加以研究，而把厦门对外贸易纳入计划，并且适当地扩大和发展，这对繁荣国家经济也是有利的。
    走社会主义的路是广大华侨的共同愿望
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，李先念副总理的关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告和薄一波副总理的关于国民经济计划的报告。从以上这些报告中，使我深深感到祖国的社会主义建设是伟大的，前途是无限光明的。经过小组反复、深入的讨论，我们肯定三个报告的内容，完全切合实际，既不夸张成绩，也不掩饰在前进中所存在的困难和缺点。这充分说明了我们国家的社会主义建设有无限的信心。祖国建设一日千里，祖国人民辛勤的劳动成果，也给予千万海外华侨无比的鼓舞力量。我们的心是永远和祖国人民连结在一起的，让我们共同为祖国更加幸福的未来，作出更大的努力。
    作为一个华侨代表的身份，让我来谈谈国外华侨的共同感受吧。在旧社会里，华侨的祖先飘海渡洋，历尽艰辛苦难，饱受歧视压迫；而在短短的八年中，祖国面貌焕然一新，国际地位空前提高，华侨在国外也抬起头来，而且和侨居地友邦人士友好相处。多年以来海外华侨所渴望的强大和统一的中国，今天才算达到了这个理想愿望。因此千万的华侨衷心拥护毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，走向社会主义的康庄大道，任何违反华侨这个共同愿望的，都为广大华侨所深恶痛绝。
    我刚从缅甸回来，看见祖国人民热烈讨论如何处理人民内部矛盾问题，各方人士提供意见，帮助政府改进工作，充分发挥民主的积极性，使我感到非常兴奋，觉得我们的祖国真是伟大！像这样广开言路，征求意见的工作方法，是古今中外所没有的，这使我们深切地体会到我们的人民政府是有信心、有办法的。但是，令人痛心的是几个担任着政府重要职务的野心家章伯钧、罗隆基等，借着这个机会，忘记了人民付托之重，散布了违反全国人民包括海外华侨心愿的谬论，企图削弱国家领导力量，达到个人的目的。毫无疑问，这些谬论是为亲者痛、仇者快，国外爱国华侨是绝对不能同意的。我们坚决拥护祖国人民以严正的态度，对这些恶毒言论严加驳斥，辨明是非。这也正说明受到最广大人民拥护的社会主义事业一定能一天天取得更大的胜利，在社会主义基础上的中国人民的大团结也一定一天天地更加巩固起来。
    应该指出：章乃器、章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平等右派分子的恶毒谬论，将为世界各反动报刊所充分利用，从而蛊惑侨胞。但是，站在爱国主义旗帜下的广大华侨，拥护祖国的社会主义建设，拥护中央人民政府的和平外交政策，是丝毫不会动摇的。相反的，在祖国人民不留余地的揭穿了右派分子的真实面目，特别是毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话的发表，不仅增加了我们辨别是非的能力，加强了我们对祖国社会主义建设的伟大信心，而且对扩大华侨爱国团结，也将起着巨大的教育作用。我们相信：海外华侨必定会更加紧密地团结在祖国的周围，为祖国的社会主义建设而贡献出力量。
