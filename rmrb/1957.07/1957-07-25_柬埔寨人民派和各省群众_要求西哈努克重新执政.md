Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh Dispatch: The Cambodian "People's Daily" published a petition from the People's Party on the 23rd, requesting Prince Sihanouk to continue serving as Prime Minister. The petition, signed by Lang Suon, Secretary-General of the People's Party, pointed out that the resignation of the Sihanouk cabinet and the prolongation of the cabinet crisis not only hinders the development of the neutral policy but also hinders the construction of the country. In addition, this will give imperialism an opportunity to interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs.

The petition stated that the People's Party is willing to work hard to unite various parties and religious groups to support the government in continuing to implement Sihanouk's plans.

Prior to this, more than 10,000 people from various provinces of Cambodia gathered in front of the Royal Palace on the 22nd, holding placards and portraits of Sihanouk, demanding Prince Sihanouk's reinstatement.

Led by members of parliament, the masses entered the Royal Palace and presented their petition to the King. The King said that he would entrust Sihanouk to lead the government after he recovered his health. Now he will appoint someone to temporarily lead the government.

    柬埔寨人民派和各省群众
    要求西哈努克重新执政
    据新华社金边电　柬埔寨“人民报”23日发表了人民派的一项请愿书，要求西哈努克亲王继续担任首相。这项由人民派总书记朗·苏恩签名的请愿书指出，西哈努克内阁的辞职和内阁危机的延长不仅妨碍了中立政策的发展，也妨碍了国家的建设。此外，这还将给帝国主义带来机会，来干预柬埔寨的内政。
    请愿书里表示，人民派愿意努力联合各党派和宗教团体，支持政府继续实现西哈努克的计划。
    在这之前，来自柬埔寨各省的群众一万多人，22日举着标语牌和西哈努克的画像，聚集在王宫前，要求西哈努克亲王重新执政。
    在议员的率领下，群众进入王宫，把他们的请愿书呈交国王。国王说，他将在西哈努克恢复健康以后委托他领导政府。现在他将指定一个人来暂时领导政府。
