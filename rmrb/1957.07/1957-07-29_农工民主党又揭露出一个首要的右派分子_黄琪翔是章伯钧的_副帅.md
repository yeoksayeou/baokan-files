Xinhua News Agency, July 28th - At an enlarged plenary meeting of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held on the afternoon of the 26th, the hypocritical mask of rightist Huang Qixiang was torn off, exposing his anti-Communist and anti-socialist true colors, as well as the conspiracy of Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu to organize a rightist clique within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

At the meeting, many people exposed Huang Qixiang's absurd words and deeds of consistently opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism.

Huang Qixiang said on the surface that he "loved" the Communist Party and that his "thoughts had not left the Communist Party for a moment" in the past twenty years. In reality, he was very hostile to the Communist Party and insulted Communist Party members. Huang Qixiang once said, "There is a lack of democracy and freedom within the Communist Party, and the organization and discipline are too strong." Therefore, he prevented his son from joining the Communist Party. He also believed that the Communist Party had grown to 12 million members, which was too many. In 1954, Huang Qixiang told members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at the Central Committee of the party to "accept the leadership of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, not the leadership of the Communist Party." In February 1954, at a meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Wuhan, he repeatedly threatened Tang Wuyuan, the deputy chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the party, and other cadres, saying: "Whoever dares to report the situation to the United Front Work Department, I can represent the Central Committee to impose disciplinary sanctions on him." He also said fiercely: "Whoever dares to leak half a word of the meeting's content to the outside world, just try it." Huang Qixiang said last year that the vice premiers of the State Council were all Communist Party members, without a single non-party person, and that the Communist Party monopolized everything and was not democratic. He was also dissatisfied with his position in the government and his work attitude was negative. He said, "People like us can only put on a show, and some things don't need to be taken care of."

Many people also exposed Huang Qixiang's open protection of Zhang Bojun in the anti-rightist struggle. Zhang Bojun's false self-criticism, "I have made serious mistakes in politics," published in the People's Daily on June 14, was a collective creation of Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Jiansheng. Before the symposium to expose Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang said that he and Zhang Bojun had "party friendship" and that "a few light strokes would be enough." Therefore, he and Zhang Bojun often sang a duet at the symposiums, and even attempted to portray Zhang Bojun's problem as a "thought problem," openly protecting Zhang Bojun, saying that his attitude of self-criticism was "relatively honest." He once comforted Zhang Bojun, saying that the passage in Premier Zhou's report criticizing rightists was aimed at Zhang Naiqi. In addition, Huang Qixiang repeatedly emphasized that the inspection team regarding Zhang Bojun should be kept secret, and told the staff attending the meeting, "Whoever leaks the inside story of the group meeting will be held responsible." As previously reported, this inspection team, headed by Huang Qixiang, has been dissolved at the enlarged plenary meeting of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party for protecting Zhang Bojun.

Huang Qixiang never admitted to secret plotting, and always touted that he did things "openly" and "frankly," but this was not the case. This spring, during the National Work Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, one day Wang Dalu went to his home and happened to find him and Li Boqiu lining up the list of Central Committee members, calculating who agreed to Huang Qixiang becoming vice chairman and who disagreed. Li Boqiu at that time warned Wang Dalu not to tell anyone. As early as December 7 last year, Huang Qixiang went to Tianjin with Zhong Dai and Wang Dalu to inspect the party affairs of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Huang discussed with Zhong the seizing of the positions of vice chairman and secretary-general of the party, while also planning to nominate himself as a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. On January 11 this year, Huang Qixiang asked Li Boqiu to come to his home, and he said to Li Boqiu: "There are three positions to be arranged, namely, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, and a member of the CPPCC." Huang Qixiang wanted to be the vice chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, believing that the vice chairman could obtain the qualifications for a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He also indicated that other positions could be given to Li Boqiu.

In early May, Huang Qixiang, together with Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu, jointly planned to "ignite fires" in six areas, including the medical and health field, the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy field, and the engineering and technical field, to carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies.

Some people also exposed the relationship between Huang Qixiang and the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Hu, which was not as he himself said, "purely a friendship." Huang once said that they had not been in contact since the Yang Hu case. Li Bohua exposed that they were still in contact after the Yang Hu case. Some people also exposed that Zhang Bojun had four lines, one of which was to collude with Chen Cheng's relationship through Huang Qixiang. In 1948, after Huang Qixiang returned from Germany, he met Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek asked him to go to Taiwan to see Chen Cheng. He obeyed Chiang Kai-shek's order and went to Taiwan to see Chen Cheng. It is unknown what tasks Chen Cheng gave him. After he returned to Hong Kong from Taiwan, he lavishly entertained guests and gave gifts.

Some people exposed Huang Qixiang's reactionary history. In 1927, after the failure of the Northern Expedition, Huang Qixiang led the Fourth Army to Guangzhou. At that time, the teaching regiment led by Ye Jianying launched an uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising broke out. Huang Qixiang personally commanded the reactionary army to massacre a large number of workers and communists. Huang Qixiang was one of the culprits who suppressed the Guangzhou Uprising.

Shi Zhongying, Zhang Bojun's sister-in-law, accused Huang Qixiang of his crimes in a written statement. She said that Shi Shuyin, also known as Shi Tianshan, was her uncle and a Communist Party member. During the Guangzhou Uprising in December 1927, Shi Shuyin was the director of the Guangzhou Health Bureau. After the failure of the uprising, Shi Shuyin hid in the eaves trough of someone else's house for seven days and seven nights. Just as he was about to escape, he was lured out and killed by Huang Qixiang's insidious tricks.

Shi Zhongying said that this matter was told to her personally by her aunt, and she now wants to accuse Huang Qixiang. She said that Huang Qixiang said in his self-criticism at the National People's Congress that since the failure of the Great Revolution, his thoughts had not left the Communist Party for a moment in the past twenty years, and he could not bear to leave the Communist Party even in the most difficult days. Shi Zhongying said that Huang Qixiang slaughtered Communist Party members and still said that his thoughts had not left the Communist Party. This is a blatant lie.

Those who exposed and criticized Huang Qixiang's reactionary words and deeds at today's meeting included Ji Fang, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Wang Dalu, Huang Qixiang's private secretary, Li Bohua, Hu Yihe, He Shikun, Yang Qingyuan, Yan Xinmin, Xu Binru, and others.

### 农工民主党又揭露出一个首要的右派分子  黄琪翔是章伯钧的“副帅”

    农工民主党又揭露出一个首要的右派分子
    黄琪翔是章伯钧的“副帅”
    据新华社28日讯　在26日下午举行的中国农工民主党中央执行局整风扩大会议，撕破了右派分子黄琪翔两面派的假面具，揭穿了他的反共反社会主义的真面目，以及章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球在农工民主党内组织右派小集团的阴谋活动。
    会上，不少人揭发了黄琪翔的一贯反共、反对社会主义的荒谬言行。
    黄琪翔表面上说他是如何“热爱”共产党，二十年来“思想上没有一时一刻离开共产党。”实际上他是非常仇视共产党，辱骂共产党员。黄琪翔曾经说，“共产党内缺少民主，缺少自由，组织性、纪律性太强。”因此，他阻挠他的儿子参加共产党。他还认为共产党员发展到一千二百万，太多了。1954年，黄琪翔在农工民主党中央叫农工党的成员“接受农工党的领导，不要接受共产党的领导。”1954年2月，他在武汉农工民主党会议上，多次威胁武汉市农工民主党副主委唐午园和干部们说：“谁敢向统战部反映情况，我可以代表中央给他纪律制裁。”并且还恶狠狠地说：“谁敢把会议情况向外面泄露半句，你们试试看。”黄琪翔在去年就说，国务院的副总理尽是共产党员，没有一位党外人士，共产党包办一切，不民主。他还对他在政府中的职务不满，工作态度消极。他说，“我们这些人，只能摆摆样子，有些事就不必去管。”
    还有许多人揭发黄琪翔在反右派斗争中公开包庇章伯钧。章伯钧在人民日报6月14日发表的“我在政治上犯了严重的错误”的假检讨，是章伯钧、黄琪翔、李健生的集体创作。黄琪翔在揭发章伯钧的座谈会前说，他和章伯钧有“同党之谊”，“轻描淡写几句就行了”。因此他和章伯钧常在座谈会上一起唱双簧，甚至还企图把章伯钧的问题说成是“思想问题”，公开包庇章伯钧，说他检讨的态度“比较老实”。他曾安慰章伯钧说，周总理报告中批判右派分子的那段话是针对章乃器的。此外，黄琪翔还一再强调关于章伯钧的检查小组要保密，并对参加会议的工作人员说，“谁泄露小组会的内情，要追究责任。”前已报道，这个以黄琪翔为首的检查小组已因包庇章伯钧而在农工民主党中央执行局的扩大会议上被解散了。
    黄琪翔从来不承认有密室策划，总是标榜他做事“公开”、“坦率”，其实并不如此。今年春天，农工民主党全国工作会议期间，有一天王大鲁到他家里去，正碰上他和李伯球正在把中央委员名单排队，计算那些人同意黄琪翔作副主席，那些人不同意。李伯球当时并警告王大鲁不要向外讲。早在去年12月7日，黄琪翔同锺岱、王大鲁赴天津视察农工民主党党务，黄就和锺商量夺取农工民主党副主席、秘书长的职位，同时还计划把自己提名为人大常委、政协常委。今年1月11日，黄琪翔找李伯球到他家里去，他对李伯球说：“有三个位子要安排，即人大常委，政协常委和政协委员。”黄琪翔要想当农工民主党副主席，他认为副主席就可以取得人大常委的资格。他并且表示，其他职务可以让给李伯球。
    5月初，黄琪翔同章伯钧、李伯球共同策划在医药卫生界、农林水利界、工程技术界等六个方面“点火”，进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。
    还有些人揭发了黄琪翔和反革命案犯杨虎的关系，并不是像他自己说的“纯粹是朋友关系”。黄曾说杨虎案发以后，他们就没有来往了。李伯华揭发他在杨虎案发以后还是有来往的。还有人揭发，章伯钧有四条路线，其中一条就是通过黄琪翔勾搭陈诚的关系。1948年，黄琪翔从德国回来以后，到南京见了蒋介石，蒋介石叫他去台湾见陈诚，他遵蒋介石的命到台湾见了陈诚，不知陈诚交给他些什么任务，他从台湾回到香港后，大肆请客、送礼。
    有些人揭发了黄琪翔的反动历史。在1927年，北伐战争失败以后，黄琪翔率第四军到广州，当时叶剑英领导的教导团起义，爆发了广州暴动，黄琪翔亲自指挥反动军队屠杀了大批工人群众和共产党人，黄琪翔就是这样一个弹压广州暴动的罪魁之一。
    章伯钧的弟媳妇史锺英在书面发言中控诉黄琪翔的罪行。她说，史淑隐，又名史天山，是她的叔叔，是共产党员。在1927年12月广州暴动时，史淑隐是广州卫生局局长。在暴动遭到失败后，史淑隐在别人的瓦屋檐沟里躲了七天七夜，眼看就可以脱险，但是被黄琪翔施用阴谋鬼计把史淑隐诱骗出来杀害了。
    史锺英说，这件事是她的婶母亲自告诉她的，她现在要控诉黄琪翔。她说，黄琪翔这次在全国人民代表大会上检讨说，从大革命失败后，二十年来在思想上没有一时一刻离开共产党，即使在最艰难的日子里，也不忍心离开共产党。史锺英说，黄琪翔屠杀了共产党员，还说思想上没有离开共产党，这是天大的谎话。
    在今天会上揭发和批判黄琪翔反动言行的有农工民主党中央副秘书长季方，黄琪翔的私人秘书王大鲁，李伯华、胡一禾、何世琨、杨清源、严信民、徐彬如等。
