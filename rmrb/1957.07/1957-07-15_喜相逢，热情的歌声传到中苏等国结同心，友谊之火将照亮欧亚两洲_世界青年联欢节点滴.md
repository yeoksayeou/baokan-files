During a recent radio conversation held by the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival, a French song called "My Friend from Beijing" floated over the airwaves to France, the Soviet Union, Italy, Finland, and China. This song was specially composed for the festival by a French composer. The gist of the lyrics is: I met him on the road, on the dusty streets, at the ends of the earth, at the corners of the sea. He just kept smiling at me, without saying anything. But I know that this is my friend from Beijing.

The youth festival delegations from China, India, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Mongolia, on their way back home, will participate in a very meaningful event in Sverdlovsk. They will hold a grand get-together next to the "Boundary Marker" between Europe and Asia, tens of kilometers away from Sverdlovsk. A raging "Flame of Friendship" will be lit here. Young men and women will be wearing carnival costumes and colorful garlands, singing and dancing to their hearts' content next to the "Boundary Marker." This event will once again demonstrate that the youth of the two continents will be as closely linked as the two continents themselves, forever.

These days, the festival and the friendship towards Chinese youth have been exciting the hearts of the youth at the Kiev Traffic Signal Machine Factory in the Soviet Union. The young employees of the assembly workshop of this factory originally decided to use their spare time to manufacture a turnout switch machine as a festival gift for the Chinese youth. When the news spread, the youth from all workshops in the factory asked to participate, and as a result, it was decided to manufacture not one but ten electric turnout switch machines in their spare time. This unique gift is a new type of machinery used on railways that can be centrally controlled electrically in the station signal room. They decided to name them the Communist Youth League Festival Electric Turnout Switch Machines.

    喜相逢，热情的歌声传到中苏等国结同心，友谊之火将照亮欧亚两洲
    世界青年联欢节点滴
    在最近联欢节国际筹委会举办的一次无线电交谈中，一首名叫“我的北京朋友”的法国歌通过无线电波飘扬在法国、苏联、意大利、芬兰和中国的上空。这是法国作曲家特意为联欢节创作的一首歌曲。歌词大意是，我和他相逢在大路上，在尘土飞扬的街道上，在天涯，在海角。他只是不断向我微笑，什么也没有说。但是我知道，这是我的来自北京的朋友。
    中国、印度、越南、寮国、柬埔寨、朝鲜和蒙古的青年联欢节代表团在回国的途中，将在斯维德洛夫斯克参加一次极有意义的活动。他们将在距斯维德洛夫斯克数十公里处的欧亚两洲的“界牌”旁举行盛大的联欢会。这里将燃起熊熊的“友谊之火”。青年男女们将穿着狂欢节的盛装，戴着五彩缤纷的花环在“界牌”旁尽情地歌舞。这次活动将再次表明，两大洲的青年将像这两大洲一样，永远紧密地连结在一起。
    这些天，联欢节和对中国青年的友谊一直在激动着苏联基辅交通讯号机工厂青年们的心。这个工厂装配车间的青年职工们原来决定用业余时间制造一部道岔转辙器，作为给中国青年的联欢节礼品。消息传开，全厂各车间青年纷纷要求参加，结果决定不是制造一部而是用业余时间制造十部电动道岔转辙器。这种别致的礼品是铁路上使用的一种可以在站内信号室中用电力集中操纵的新式机械。他们决定把它们命名为共青团联欢节电动道岔转辙器。
