    Brief News on Czechoslovak Industrial Technology
    One Hundred Factories Produce Chinese Orders
    One hundred heavy industrial factories in Czechoslovakia are currently producing orders for our country. Production is to increase 68% compared to last year, accounting for about 60% of all machinery and equipment supplied by Czechoslovakia to all People's Democratic countries. Chinese orders produced by these factories mainly include various machinery and equipment, power station equipment, complete sets of equipment for manufacturing chemical fertilizers, and sugar refineries. Production teams in these factories have now made guarantees to accelerate the completion of the production tasks for Chinese orders.
    The First Automated Factory
    The Buzuluk Machinery Factory in Czechoslovakia recently manufactured a complete set of equipment for an automated factory producing rubber bands. This will be Czechoslovakia's first fully automated factory. It includes twenty-three automated machines, all operated by one engineer through an electrical system. This factory can produce various rubber bands ranging from six meters to sixty meters in length every minute.
    New Achievements in Electronic Tube Production
    Miroslav Šimír, the director of the electronic tube research laboratory at the Tesla factory in Ražňany, recently achieved new and brilliant successes in the manufacture of electronic tubes. He successfully created a new record of eighty out of every one hundred electronic tubes meeting specifications, thereby reducing the production cost of each electronic tube by about one-third. Manufacturing electronic tubes is a very complex production task. It is understood that in the United States, currently only forty out of every one hundred electronic tubes manufactured for televisions and radios are fully compliant with specifications. Therefore, the recent achievements made by Czechoslovakia in this area are of great significance.
    Egg "Factory" in Agricultural Cooperative
    The Abrušensky Agricultural Cooperative in Czechoslovakia has one of the most advanced chicken farms in the country. In this chicken farm, several rows of three-tiered iron cages have been built. Each cage contains one or two hens, housing a total of nine hundred hens. (See picture below)
    The production equipment of this chicken farm is almost completely automated. Each layer of the cage has a densely woven metal mesh floor, with a manure box underneath the metal mesh. Chicken manure is removed by an automatic scraper.
    The hen feed is transported by an automatic feeding trough, with the conveyor belt moving at a speed of eight meters per hour. This is done five times a day.
    The hens in the cages are isolated, which can avoid infectious diseases. At the same time, the feed contains a large amount of vitamins, minerals, and antibiotics. The hens are all healthy. Because this method of raising chickens can also maintain a certain indoor temperature, hens can lay eggs even in the cold winter season. This farm can produce hundreds of fresh eggs every day. In the first two months of this year alone, it supplied 40,000 eggs to the market. (Picture attached)

    捷克斯洛伐克工业技术简讯
    一百个工厂生产中国订货
    捷克斯洛伐克有一百个重工业工厂目前正在为我国生产订货，产品要比去年增加68％，在捷克斯洛伐克对所有人民民主国家供应的机器设备中占60％左右。这些工厂所生产的中国订货主要包括各种机器设备，发电站的装备，制造化学肥料的工厂和制糖厂的成套设备等。现在这些工厂的生产队已经提出保证，要加速完成中国订货的生产任务。
    第一个自动化工厂
    捷克斯洛伐克布祖鲁克机械工厂最近制造了一个生产橡皮线的自动化工厂的成套设备。这将是捷克斯洛伐克第一个完全自动化的工厂。它包括二十三架自动化的机器，全部由一个工程师通过电气系统来操纵。这个工厂在每一分钟内可以生产从六公尺到六十公尺的各种不同的橡皮线。
    电子管生产的新成就
    拉日罗夫的泰斯拉工厂电子管研究室主任米罗斯·辛米尔，不久前在电子管的制造方面获得了新的辉煌成就。他成功地创造了每生产一百个电子管有八十个合乎规格的新纪录，并因此而使每个电子管的生产成本降低了三分之一左右。制造电子管是非常复杂的生产任务。据了解，在美国，现在每制造一百电视机和收音机用的电子管，其中只有四十个是完全合乎规格的。因此捷克斯洛伐克最近在这方面所获得的成就具有很重要的意义。
    农业合作社里的鸡蛋“工厂”
    捷克斯洛伐克阿布尔仁斯基农业合作社拥有一个国内最先进的养鸡厂。在这个养鸡厂里，建筑了几排三层的铁笼子。每一格笼子里有一、二只母鸡，总共饲养着九百只母鸡。（见下图）
    这个养鸡厂的生产设备，几乎完全是自动化的。每一层笼子地上有密织的金属网，金属网底下有一个装粪盒。鸡粪由自动刮泥机清除掉。
    母鸡的饲料是由自动食槽传送的，传送带以每小时八公尺的速度传送。每天要这样传送五次。
    在鸡笼里的母鸡是隔离的，这样可以避免传染病。同时在饲料里含有大量维生素、矿物质和抗生素。母鸡个个健康。由于这种养鸡方法还能经常保持一定的室内温度，即使在严冬的季节里母鸡也能够下蛋。这个厂每天可以生产几百个新鲜鸡蛋。在今年头两个月里，就供应市场四万个鸡蛋。（附图片）
