    115A Radio Has Too Much Static
    I was particularly happy to see the news in the newspaper that the Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory produces several radios per minute; but in addition to being happy, I was also very disappointed.
    In May of this year, I bought a 115A five-tube radio produced by the Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory in March. The appearance is beautiful and generous, and the instructions are written so grandly, but the sound is low and there is too much static. After repairs, it is still the same. I hope this factory will first improve product quality and then seek speed, otherwise what is the point of manufacturing several units per minute?　Gu Qin

    115A型收音机杂音多
    在报上看到上海广播器材厂每分钟制出几架收音机的消息，特别高兴；但在高兴之余，又很失望。
    今年5月我买了一架上海广播器材厂3月出品的115A型五灯收音机。外表美观、大方，说明书上写的又是那么堂而皇之，但声音小，杂音太多。经过修理，也仍然那样。我希望这个工厂首先提高产品质量，然后才求快，否则每分钟制造几架，又有什么意义呢？　谷钦
