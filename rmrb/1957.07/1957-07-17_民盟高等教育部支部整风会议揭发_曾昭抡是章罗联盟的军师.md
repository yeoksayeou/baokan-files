    **Democratic League Higher Education Department Branch Rectification Meeting Exposes**
    **Zeng Zhaolun as the "Military Advisor" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance**
    (Our Newspaper News) Zeng Zhaolun, the main designer of the anti-socialist science program, gave an explanation at the enlarged rectification meeting of the Democratic League Higher Education Department branch on the evening of the 11th, which was met with great dissatisfaction by comrades in the department. On the 12th, many comrades posted big-character posters pointing out that Zeng Zhaolun's explanation only addressed issues that had already been exposed; he tried his best to explain and shirk responsibility; he emphasized his backward thinking and being accidentally used by others; he blamed the personal ambitions of Zhang and Luo, and did not expose the planned, organized, and programmed conspiracy activities of their entire group.
    In order to help Zeng Zhaolun further explain his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, the Democratic League Higher Education Department branch continued to hold an enlarged rectification meeting on the evening of the 15th.
    **Served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Famous Anti-Soviet, Anti-Communist Publication "Epoque Critique"**
    The meeting's moderator, Shen Yifan, first said that Zeng Zhaolun had made a preliminary explanation on the evening of the 11th, which was good. However, his explanation was still extremely dishonest, and many important matters had not been discussed. Shen Yifan revealed Zeng Zhaolun's anti-Communist and anti-people activities in Kunming and other places during the Anti-Japanese War. Zeng Zhaolun had dealings with Luo Longji in Kunming, and also had unusual relationships with other right-wing elements such as Pan Guangdan. Was that the foundation of their small group at that time? Did they engage in third-way activities? After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, before coming to take over Peking University, Zeng Zhaolun once said to people in Kunming, "The KMT and the Communist Party will confront each other for at least fifty years, and the Democratic League has great potential." What did this mean? After Zeng Zhaolun arrived in Beijing, he actively engaged in the work of the Democratic League with Zhang Dongsun, Ye Duyi, and others. But strangely, after the "Li-Wen Incident" in 1946, he took money and a passport from the Kuomintang reactionaries and slipped away to the United States. He should explain the details of this. Shen Yifan said that Zeng Zhaolun also admitted that when he returned to Hong Kong from abroad, he participated in a symposium of right-wing elements, but did not explain who participated or what activities took place. As far as I know, he not only participated in right-wing symposiums, but also engaged in other activities, such as serving as the editor-in-chief of the famous anti-Soviet, anti-Communist publication "Epoque Critique." The reason Zeng Zhaolun stayed in Hong Kong was because Zhou Xinmin and Sa Kongliao went on board to persuade him to stay, not because he saw that the domestic situation was not good. He also admitted that before the "Three-Anti" campaign in 1952, he had a close relationship with the Luo Longji clique and met every week, but only explained one conspiracy activity in which full-time cadres of the Beijing branch of the Democratic League sabotaged the election. In fact, there were other conspiracy activities, and Zeng Zhaolun should thoroughly explain them.
    **Wearing the Guise of a Scientist, Actually Acting as the "Military Advisor" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance**
    Li Jiemin from the Teaching Guidance Department then spoke. He said, I think Zeng Zhaolun's attitude in his explanation is not correct. The materials revealed in the newspapers alone are enough to prove that Zeng Zhaolun is a political conspirator wearing the guise of a scientist, putting on a kind face, and engaging in anti-Communist, anti-people activities within the people; he is a brave general and a vanguard in the Zhang-Luo alliance; he is the "military advisor" of Zhang and Luo, the soul of the Zhang-Luo clique. Li Jiemin questioned: Zeng Zhaolun gloated over the fact that the current situation in China is tense, and that if students and citizens unite, a Hungarian incident will occur, and the situation is on the verge of exploding. As the Deputy Minister of Higher Education, why would he be afraid that the schools would not be in chaos? What are his intentions? Zeng Zhaolun also attempted to come out as a savior to clean up the chaotic situation, how arrogant! After the Party began the rectification campaign, members of their small group set fires everywhere, and Zeng Zhaolun leaked state secrets to their small group, planned activities, and provoked the relationship between the Party and the people, and between the Party and young people, fearing that the world would not be in chaos, hoping that this great fire would burn down the Chinese Communist Party and revive capitalism. How serious is this series of conspiracy activities!
    **Squeezing out Progressive Elements within the Democratic League, Usurping the Leadership of the League's Central Committee**
    Chen Duanyi from the Overseas Students Management Department said that Zeng Zhaolun is a typical anti-Communist, anti-socialist bourgeois right-wing intellectual. He has consistently worshipped the democracy of American imperialism, the American imperialist way of life, and various capitalist systems, and has consistently and actively promoted these ugly things. As late as 1957, when he represented the Higher Education Department in introducing the situation of higher education in China to the members of the Hungarian education delegation, the Director of the Higher Education Department of Hungary, he was still promoting that the American education system he worshipped was not bad. In 1948, after he returned to Hong Kong from the United States via the United Kingdom, he attended symposiums, ran magazines, and wrote articles with right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun and Zhou Jingwen, doing everything possible to promote the United States and the middle road. At the same time, he spread negative emotions among the cadres of the Democratic League in Hong Kong, and he advised everyone to go home and "not suffer in Hong Kong." He supported the peace offensive launched by Stuart Leighton and Li Zongren at the time to block the counterattack of the people's army led by the Communist Party. When discussing the program of the New Political Consultative Conference, he colluded with right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun and insisted on advocating only nationalism and not New Democracy. Chen Duanyi said: I want to question you—Zeng Zhaolun, in 1945, the Kuomintang Ordnance Department gave you money and sent you to the United States, and soon you suddenly returned to Hong Kong from the United States. Did you come back to participate in the revolution and participate in the democratic movement? If so, why did you collude with a group of right-wing elements to do so many counter-revolutionary and anti-people things? Who entrusted you, accepted whose task, and received whose instructions? Luo Longji said at a forum convened by the Central Committee of the Democratic League last week that before he went to Beidaihe last year, there was a period of time when his cooperation with Zhang Bojun was not very good due to the relationship of competition for power and profit. You were very anxious about this situation and actively ran around, looking for Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. You said: "You must cooperate well and do a good job in the cultural and educational circles." From Luo Longji's confession, we can see that Zeng Zhaolun is the main backbone of the Zhang-Luo alliance. We want to ask Zeng Zhaolun, what is your intention in actively promoting the Zhang-Luo alliance? After you, the Deputy Minister of Higher Education, helped them form an alliance, what work should be done in the cultural and educational circles? How to do these works well? Last year, after you and Zhang and Luo returned to Beijing from Beidaihe, you squeezed out progressive people in the Democratic League, and you plotted to squeeze out Chairman Shen Junru and replace him with Zhang Bojun as chairman, Luo Longji as the first vice chairman, squeeze out Secretary-General Hu Yuzhi, replace him with your right-wing element Pan Dakui, squeeze out Director Chu Tunan of the Cultural and Educational Committee, and replace him with yourself. According to Pu Xixiu's revelation at the news work symposium last week, you participated in these major personnel arrangements. After you plotted to usurp the leadership of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, you immediately launched a frenzied attack on the Party, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign.
    Four professors from the Chemistry Department of Peking University, Sun Chenge, Jiang Mingqian, Xing Qiyi, and Tang Youqi, also requested to speak and came to attend the meeting.
    **Playing Politics, Sowing Discord, Squeezing and Attacking Others During His Time at Peking University**
    Professor Sun Chenge is now the chairman of the Chemistry Department of Peking University. He said that he and Zeng Zhaolun had been colleagues for seventeen years. Zeng Zhaolun worked at Peking University for twenty years from 1931 to 1951. From 1931 to 1937, when the Japanese invaders invaded and the student movement was booming, Zeng Zhaolun took Japanese imperialist money and took students to travel in Japan. During the Anti-Japanese War, he began to collude with Luo Longji and went to see the American "special envoy" Marshall. What did they do? After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek tore up the "Double Tenth Agreement," and the Party was leading the people to fight. At that time, he took money from the Kuomintang reactionaries' "Ministry of National Defense Ordnance Department" and took some people to the United States, saying that he was preparing to return to engage in a "National Defense Science Research Institute" for the Kuomintang. He should explain these issues clearly. During his time at Peking University, Zeng Zhaolun used villains to squeeze out old professors, causing everyone to be disunited. He once colluded with the special agent Hu Mei to carry out activities. Later, the special agent committed suicide in fear of punishment. After liberation, he colluded with another bad element to squeeze out professors such as Feng Shiquan and Xing Qiyi. Sun Chenge said that during the "Three-Anti" campaign, Zeng Zhaolun evaded inspection. I personally went to the Higher Education Department to ask him to return to Peking University to attend the meeting. He went but said that he was giving everyone a "report." When everyone revealed his ugly behavior, he simply did not go. He also hoped that he would explain why he evaded.
    Professor Jiang Mingqian had been Zeng Zhaolun's student and teaching assistant. At the meeting, he angrily exposed Zeng Zhaolun's ugly face of consistently playing politics and manipulating power in the past. He said that when Zeng Zhaolun served as the chairman of the Chemistry Department of Peking University, he consistently sowed discord, squeezed and attacked professors. Several professors, including Liu Yunpu, were squeezed out and left the school by him, and he also squeezed out Professor Sun Chenge, who had been his colleague at Peking University for seventeen years. After he served as the Deputy Minister of Higher Education, he refused to let go of the position of chairman of the Chemistry Department and continued to play politics for more than a year. Finally, all the professors were dissatisfied with his control and withdrew their letters of appointment, and he had to leave Peking University. Jiang Mingqian also exposed several ugly acts of Zeng Zhaolun playing politics. The first was in 1950, when Zeng Zhaolun deliberately pulled away the only five researchers from the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attempting to bring down the Institute of Chemistry, because he was not allowed to be the vice president of the Academy of Sciences. The second was that from 1933 to 1951, Zeng Zhaolun had been controlling the Chinese Chemical Society. The third was that in the early days of liberation, Zeng Zhaolun asked teachers in the Chemistry Department of Peking University to write many "plans" for him, and then used the names of other units to send these plans to the government to deceive the Party and the government into trusting him.
    **A Great Swindler in the Scientific Community, a Vicious "Ba Tou" Professor**
    Professor Xing Qiyi of the Chemistry Department of Peking University, who had been attacked and squeezed out by Zeng Zhaolun, said: Zeng Zhaolun studied chemical engineering abroad. After returning from studying abroad, it was after the First World War. He was very interested in the use of poison gas to kill people by Germany in the war, so he wrote books and articles to promote it, and he started poison gas chemistry. Later, he used the guise of a scholar to take chemistry as political capital to approach the government and engage in political activities. When he was in Kunming, Zeng Zhaolun did not teach well. He took people to travel in the former Xikang Province for a long time. Where did the money come from? What did he do? I hope he will explain it clearly. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he took money from the puppet Ministry of National Defense to the United States, and after returning, he bragged about his atomic energy and wrote books to promote it. Judging from his actions, he is not a scholar at all, but simply a great swindler in the scientific community. His face was gradually seen through, and he could not make a living in the chemistry community. When he had almost no share even as a standing director in the "Chinese Chemical Society," he drilled into the chemical industry and became the vice chairman of a "Chemical Industry Society." What is his purpose? Zeng Zhaolun should thoroughly explain. Comrades in the department may not understand what the problem of "professors governing the school" is. Today, it should be clear! Zeng Zhaolun is one of the most vicious "Ba Tou" professors in the old Peking University. It is difficult to blame many professors for immediately thinking of the return of the feudal "Ba Tou" when they hear the four words "professors governing the school," so they unanimously said that if "professors govern the school" now, the revolution would be in vain!
    Professor Tang Youqi said: Zeng Zhaolun said last time that Luo Longji was insidious and ruthless, and would win people over when he wanted to use them, and kick them away when he didn't need them. In fact, from my observation, Zeng Zhaolun is no different from Luo Longji in this regard. As far as I know, Zeng Zhaolun has always used this method to carry out activities and gain status in the chemical community. The targets of this method are sometimes individuals, and sometimes a class of people. For example, he often sows discord among professors and uses and takes advantage of young people to attack professors. He is a complete academic tyrant and politician. In his recently designed "Several Opinions on Scientific Planning," he also said something about "treating everyone equally." Is it not enough for the Communist Party to be selfless in building socialism? His method is completely used to accumulate his political capital.
    **Appreciating Anglo-American Bourgeois Democracy, Actively Promoting Pro-Americanism and Affection for America**
    Then Zhu Qifang of the Finance Department said: Zeng Zhaolun did not explain Zhang and Luo's anti-Party activities, nor did he express his attitude, which particularly aroused the anger of all members of the Democratic League in the Higher Education Department. Zeng Zhaolun said, "Treating intellectuals in the form of campaigns in the past violated the laws of intellectuals." This has already revealed that he is afraid of ideological reform and other campaigns. I want to ask, Zeng Zhaolun, why are you afraid? It is not difficult to see the bottom line of your fear: First, you admire Anglo-American democracy very much, and especially approve of the so-called "American civilization." After you left the United States, you published many pro-American articles in Chu Anping's "Observer" magazine. Second, after you returned to China, you participated in a series of right-wing symposiums organized by Zhang Bojun in Hong Kong. Third, after liberation, you and Luo Longji, Zhang Dongsun, and others engaged in sectarian activities and had ulterior secrets. Fourth, when you taught at Peking University, you engaged in sectarianism and controlled the Chemistry Department. During the ideological reform, Peking University asked you to go several times, but you did not dare to go. An intellectual with vicious things in his mind and harboring ghosts is afraid of reform. You should examine your conscience and compare it with the past. Can it be said that your current situation is not as good as the situation before liberation? You served as the Deputy Minister in the Higher Education Department, and you were in charge of the industrial education for building the motherland in the division of labor. Your position is very high and your responsibilities are heavy. It can be seen that the Party trusts you very much, and it also gives you good living conditions. When you visited the Soviet Union, you also received the respect and preferential treatment of foreign friends. These honors and trusts are not given to you by the Party and the people? Can it be said that the Party does not respect and trust intellectuals?
    Zhou Zhongqi of the Industry Department, Ma Huiying of the General Office, Feng Zhisen of the Teaching Guidance Department, and Chen Heying of the Comprehensive University Department also spoke at the meeting. All the comrades in the Industrial Education Department also wrote an open letter to Zeng Zhaolun to raise questions.
    The meeting's moderator, Shen Yifan, finally said that he hoped that Zeng Zhaolun would prepare to give another explanation at the next meeting based on the opinions raised by everyone.

### 民盟高等教育部支部整风会议揭发  曾昭抡是章罗联盟的军师

    民盟高等教育部支部整风会议揭发
    曾昭抡是章罗联盟的军师
    本报讯　反社会主义科学纲领的主要设计人曾昭抡，11日晚在民主同盟高等教育部支部整风扩大会议上作的交代，部内的同志们感到极不满意。12日，许多同志贴大字报指出，曾昭抡的交代只是谈已经被揭发的问题；尽量解释，推脱责任；强调思想落后，偶然被人利用；归罪于章、罗个人的野心，并没有揭发他们整个集团有计划、有组织、有纲领的阴谋活动。
    为了帮助曾昭抡进一步交代他反党反社会主义的言行，15日晚，民主同盟高等教育部支部继续举行整风扩大会议。
    担任过有名的反苏反共刊物“时代评论”的总编辑
    会议主持人沈一帆首先说，11日晚上曾昭抡初步作了交代，这是好的。但是他的交代还极不老实，许多重要事情都还没有谈。沈一帆揭露了曾昭抡抗日战争期间在昆明等地时反共反人民的活动。曾昭抡在昆明时就同罗隆基有来往，同其他右派分子潘光旦等也有来往，关系很不平常。是否那时他们就有了小集团的基础？是否就进行了第三条路线的活动？1945年抗日战争胜利以后，来接收北京大学以前，曾昭抡在昆明曾经对人讲过，“国共对峙起码有五十年，民盟大有可为”。这是什么意思？曾昭抡到北京以后，他又同张东荪、叶笃义等积极搞民盟的工作。但奇怪的是，1946年“李闻事件”以后，他却拿了国民党反动派的钱和护照溜到美国去了。这里面的细节，要他自己交代。沈一帆说，曾昭抡还承认从国外回到香港的时候，曾参加了右派分子的座谈会，但没交代有那些人参加，有些什么活动？据我所知，他不仅参加过右派座谈会，还搞了其他活动，如担任过有名的反苏反共的刊物“时代评论”的总编辑。曾昭抡之所以在香港留下来，是周新民、萨空了上船去劝下来的，并不是他看到国内形势不好而留下的。他还承认1952年“三反”以前，他同罗隆基小集团的关系很密切，而且每星期都见面，可是只交代了一件民盟北京市支部专职干部破坏选举的阴谋活动。实际上，还有其他的阴谋活动，曾昭抡要彻底交代。
    披着科学家外衣，实际上充当章罗联盟的军师
    教学指导司李洁民接着发言。他说，我认为曾昭抡交代的态度是不端正的。仅从报纸上揭露的一些材料已足以证明，曾昭抡是一个披着科学家外衣，摆着一副慈祥面孔，在人民内部进行反共、反人民的政治阴谋家；是章罗中间的一员骁将、冲锋陷阵的先锋；是章罗的军师，章罗小集团的灵魂。李洁民质问：曾昭抡曾幸灾乐祸地认为目前中国局势紧张，学生和市民结合起来就要发生匈牙利事变，时局一触即发。他身为高等教育部副部长，为什么唯恐学校不乱？居心何在？曾昭抡还企图以救世主的身份出来收拾混乱局面，多么狂妄！在党开始整风以后，他们小集团的成员到处放火，曾昭抡向他们小集团泄露国家机密，策划活动，挑拨党和人民、和青年的关系，唯恐天下不乱，希望这一场大火烧垮中国共产党，使资本主义死灰复燃。这一系列的阴谋活动，罪恶多么严重！
    在民盟内排挤进步分子，篡夺盟中央的领导权
    留学生管理司陈端仪说，曾昭抡是一个反共反社会主义的资产阶级右派知识分子的典型，他一贯崇拜美帝国主义的民主，崇拜美帝国主义的生活方式和资本主义的各种制度，而且一贯积极地为这些丑恶的东西作宣传。直到1957年，他代表高等教育部向匈牙利教育代表团团员、匈牙利高等教育司司长介绍我国高等教育情况时，还在宣传他崇拜的美国教育制度没有什么不好。1948年，他从美国转英国回到香港，就同章伯钧、周鲸文等右派分子在一起开座谈会、办杂志、写文章，极尽宣传美国、宣传中间路线的能事。同时他在香港民盟的干部中间散布消极情绪，他劝大家都回家去，“不要在香港吃苦了”。他拥护当时司徒雷登、李宗仁发动和平攻势阻挡共产党领导的人民军队的反攻。他在讨论新政协的纲领时，又同章伯钧等右派分子勾结在一起，坚持主张只要民族主义，不要新民主主义。陈端仪说：我要质问你——曾昭抡，1945年国民党兵工署拿钱给你，送你到美国去，不久你又忽然从美国回到香港。你是回来参加革命、参加民主运动的吗？如果是，那你为什么同一伙右派分子勾结在一起干这么一些反革命、反人民的勾当？你受谁的委托，接受谁给的任务，受谁的指使？罗隆基上星期在民盟中央召开的座谈会上说，去年他去北戴河以前，有一段时间他同章伯钧由于争权夺利的关系合作得不大好，你就对这情况很焦虑，积极地奔走，找了章伯钧，又找罗隆基。你说：“你们要好好合作，要做好文教界的工作”。从罗隆基的这一坦白中，可以看到曾昭抡是章罗联盟的主要骨干。我们要问曾昭抡，你这样积极地来促成章罗联盟，你的用意何在？你这个高等教育部的副部长要他们结成联盟以后，做好文教界的什么工作？怎样来做好这些工作？去年你和章、罗从北戴河回到北京以后，你们就在民盟排挤进步人士，你们计谋把沈钧儒主席挤掉，换上章伯钧作主席，罗隆基作第一副主席，把胡愈之秘书长挤掉，换上你们的右派分子潘大逵，把文教委员会楚图南主任挤掉，换上你自己。根据浦熙修上周在新闻工作座谈会上的揭发，这样一些主要的人事安排，你是都参加了的。你们在计谋篡夺民盟中央的领导权以后，紧接着你们趁共产党整风的机会，就向党发起了疯狂的进攻。
    特从北京大学化学系赶来参加会议的四位教授，孙承谔、蒋明谦、邢其毅和唐有祺也要求发言。
    在北大期间玩弄权术，挑拨离间，排挤打击别人
    孙承谔教授现在是北京大学化学系系主任，他说他和曾昭抡同事过十七年。曾昭抡从1931年到1951年在北京大学工作了二十年。1931年到1937年正是日寇入侵、学生运动蓬勃发展的时候，曾昭抡却拿着日本帝国主义的钱，带学生到日本去旅行。抗日战争期间，他就开始和罗隆基勾结在一起，同去见过美国“特使”马歇尔，不知干了些什么？抗日战争胜利以后，蒋介石撕毁“双十协定”，党正领导人民进行斗争，当时他却拿了国民党反动派“国防部兵工署”的钱，带了一些人到美国去了，说是准备回来给国民党搞什么“国防科学研究院”的。这些问题要他交代清楚。曾昭抡在北大期间，利用小人排挤老教授，搞得大家不团结。他曾经和特务胡美勾结在一起活动，后来那个特务是畏罪自杀的。解放以后，他又勾结另一坏分子排挤冯式权、邢其毅等教授。孙承谔说，“三反”的时候，曾昭抡则逃避检查，我曾亲自到高教部来请他回北大去开会，他去了却说是给大家作“报告”。大家揭露他的丑恶行为时，他竟然根本不去了。他为什么逃避，也希望他作交代。
    蒋明谦教授，曾作过曾昭抡的学生和助教。他在会上愤慨地揭发了曾昭抡过去一贯玩弄权术、操权弄势的丑恶面目。他说，曾昭抡在北京大学担任化学系主任时，一贯在教授间挑拨离间、排挤打击。刘云浦等好几位教授都被他排挤离开了学校，和他在北京大学同事了十七年的孙承谔教授，他也排挤。他担任高等教育部副部长以后，还不肯放掉化学系主任的位子，继续玩弄了一年多的权术，最后所有教授因为不满意他的把持，退了聘书，他才不得不离开北大。蒋明谦还揭发了曾昭抡几件玩弄权术的丑行。第一是1950年，曾昭抡故意拉走了中国科学院化学研究所仅有的五位研究员，企图把化学研究所拉垮，原因是没有让他做科学院副院长。第二是从1933年到1951年，曾昭抡一直把持着中国化学会。第三是在解放初期，曾昭抡让北大化学系的教师为他写了许多“方案”，又用别的单位的名义把这些方案送给政府，去骗取党和政府对他的信任。
    科学界的大骗子，凶恶的把头教授
    曾经受过曾昭抡打击、排挤的北京大学化学系教授邢其毅说：曾昭抡在国外留学是学化学工程的，留学回来正是第一次世界大战以后，他对大战中德国使用毒气杀人很感兴趣，于是写书、写文章大加鼓吹，他搞起毒气化学来了。以后他就打着学者的幌子，拿化学当作政治资本，借以接近政府，进行政治活动。在昆明的时候，曾昭抡并不好好教书，他带人到原西康省等地长期旅行，哪儿来的钱？究竟去干了些什么？希望他交代清楚。抗战胜利以后，他拿伪国防部的钱到美国去，回来后他就大吹其原子能，并写书宣传。从他那一些行径看来，他哪里是什么学者，简直是个科学界的大骗子。他的面目慢慢被人看穿，在化学界吃不开了，甚至在“中国化学会”中连个常务理事都几乎没有份儿的时候，他又钻到化工界去了，搞上了一个
  “化工学会”的副理事长。他的目的是什么？曾昭抡应该彻底交代。部里的同志们也许不了解“教授治校”是怎么一个问题，今天就总可以清楚了吧！曾昭抡就是旧北大的把头教授中凶恶的一个。这就很难怪许多教授一听见“教授治校”四个字，马上就会想到封建把头又回来了，所以一致地说，假若现在“教授治校”，革命就白革了！
    唐有祺教授说：曾昭抡上次交代时说，罗隆基阴险毒辣，要利用人时就拉拢，不要时就踢开。其实，从我的观察中，曾昭抡在这一点上和罗隆基并无二致。据我所知，曾昭抡在化学界一直是运用这个手法来活动和取得地位的。这种手法的运用对象，有时是一个个的人，也可以是一个阶层的人。例如他经常在教授之间挑拨，并假借和利用年青人来打击教授。他是十足的学阀和政客。他最近在他设计的“关于科学规划的几点意见”中，还说什么“一视同仁”。难道共产党在建设社会主义的事业中，还不够大公无私吗？他的这种手法完全是为了积累他的政治资本而使用的。
    欣赏英美式资产阶级民主，积极宣传崇美、亲美
    接着财务司朱其芳说：曾昭抡对章罗联盟的反党活动没有交代，也没有表示态度，这特别激起了高教部全体盟员的愤怒。曾昭抡说，“过去以运动方式对待知识分子是违反知识分子规律的”。这已经流露出他对思想改造等几个运动是害怕的。我要问，曾昭抡你为什么害怕？这不难看出你害怕的底子：一、你是很欣赏英美式的民主，特别赞成所谓“美国式的文明”。你离开美国后在储安平办的“观察”杂志上发表了许多崇美、亲美的文章。二、你返国后在香港参加了章伯钧组织一系列右派性质的座谈会。三、解放后你和罗隆基、张东荪等人搞宗派活动，有不可告人的秘密。四、你在北京大学任教时，闹宗派，控制化学系。思想改造时，北京大学几次要你去，你都不敢去。一个大知识分子思想上有恶毒的东西，心怀鬼胎，是要害怕改造的。你扪一扪良心，比一比既往。难道说你现在的情况还不如解放前的情况吗？在高等教育部你担任了副部长，在分工上将建设祖国的工业教育由你主管，地位很高，责任重大，可见党对你是很信任的；也给予你很好的生活条件。在你出国访苏时，也得到了国外友人的尊敬和优待。这些荣誉和信任，不是党和人民给予你的吗？这能说党对知识分子不尊重、不信任吗？
    在会上发言的还有工业司周仲岐、办公厅马惠英、教学指导司冯植森、综合大学司陈荷英。工业教育司全体同志还写了一封公开信向曾昭抡提出质问。
    会议主持人沈一帆最后说，希望曾昭抡根据大家提的意见，准备在下次会议上再作交代。
