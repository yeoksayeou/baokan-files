The Military Engineering Academy has successfully concluded a debate on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries during the anti-rightist struggle. Wang Weiyi's fallacies were systematically criticized. Wang Weiyi was a librarian at the Military Engineering Academy. He spread rumors that the mistakes in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were fundamental and that its effectiveness was doubtful. He said, "There is no one more cruel than you." During the "blooming and contending," his arrogance was extreme. He rode a bicycle with the words "I am Wang Weiyi" prominently displayed on his chest and back, challenging people to debates everywhere. He claimed that the correct method for suppressing counter-revolutionaries was not to mobilize the masses to struggle but to engage in "peaceful negotiations" with counter-revolutionaries.

During the five debate sessions, forty-eight people spoke out to refute Wang Weiyi's fallacies. Many more signed up to speak, and even more wrote notes to Wang Weiyi with questions and criticisms. At the meetings, Wang Weiyi repeatedly spoke evasively, but ultimately, under the just rebuttal of the masses, his fallacies were defeated.

The comrades who spoke vehemently condemned Wang Weiyi's absurd claim that the main criterion for success in the struggle was that three out of five targets must be counter-revolutionaries. They pointed out that his preposterous three-to-two formula was untenable. Comrade Wang Tiepan said: The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not production; it is not a task that can be calculated by numbers. This formalistic view is completely wrong, or else it is malicious.

Among the comrades who spoke were some who had been designated as key targets during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. They used their personal experiences to illustrate that the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were significant and that the Party was great and realistic. Comrade Hou Xiangnong said: During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I was accused of killing peasants. The organization conducted multiple investigations and took me back to my hometown for verification, finally clarifying the truth. The leadership exonerated me, apologized, and awarded me a military rank. My comrades were even more enthusiastic towards me. This proves that the Party is realistic and cares for its cadres. Comrade Hou Xiangnong also criticized Wang Weiyi's statement that "there is no one more cruel than you." He said: The Kuomintang killed countless revolutionary martyrs at Yuhuatai in Nanjing, and the Japanese devils killed countless of our compatriots. My father and brother were local bullies who killed peasants. That is true cruelty!

The comrades who spoke also refuted Wang Weiyi's lie that he was "originally a revolutionary but was turned into a counter-revolutionary" during the struggle against him. Qiao Xingli said: Wang Weiyi's social history is very complex. He had frequent contact with Kuomintang secret agents and upper-class figures, and he participated in the extremely reactionary "Mainstream Society." He usually made very reactionary remarks. His family background was also very backward. Shouldn't a person like this be thoroughly investigated?

At the debate, many comrades exposed Wang Weiyi's reactionary words and deeds. Comrade Shi Jixia said: Wang Weiyi once attacked our country's people's democratic system. He ridiculed the comrades who were struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "soft bones" in order to incite their dissatisfaction. Zhang Huimin said: Wang Weiyi hopes for chaos in the world. He hates the Party and despises socialism.

    军事工程学院举行肃反问题辩论会
    驳倒反对肃反的王惟一
    本报讯　军事工程学院在反右派斗争中召开肃反问题辩论会，已经胜利结束，王惟一的谬论受到了系统的批判。王惟一是军事工程学院的图书馆管理员，他到处扬言肃反的错误是基本的，效果值得怀疑，他说“再没有比你们更残忍的了”。在鸣放中，他的气焰极为嚣张，曾骑上自行车，在胸前和背后贴上“我是王惟一”几个大字，到处向人辩论挑战。他说肃反的正确方法不是发动群众斗争，而是同反革命分子“和平谈判”。
    在五次辩论会上，有四十八人发言驳斥王惟一的谬论，有很多人报名要求发言，还有更多人写条子向王惟一提出质问和斥责。会上，王惟一几次发言诡辩，但最后在群众的正义驳斥下，他的谬论破产了。
    发言的同志痛斥了王惟一提出斗争五个必须有三个是反革命才算成绩是主要的荒谬说法，指出他这种三比二的荒谬公式是站不住脚的。王铁藩同志说：肃反不是生产，不是按数字来计算任务的。这种形式主义的看法，是完全错误的，否则就是别有用心。
    在发言的同志中，有一些同志是在肃反中被列为重点的。他们以自己的亲身经历，说明肃反的成绩是主要的，党是伟大的、实事求是的。后相农同志说：在肃反中，我被人检举曾枪杀过农民，组织上经过多次调查，又把我带回家乡进行对证，终于搞清了真象。领导上给我平反、道歉，并授予军衔，同志们对我更热情。这证明党是实事求是和关怀干部的。后相农同志还批判了王惟一所说“再没有比你们更残忍”的说法。他说：国民党在南京雨花台不知杀了多少革命志士，日本鬼子不知杀死我国多少同胞，我的父兄是恶霸曾经杀死农民，这才是残忍！
    发言的同志还批驳了王惟一所说他被斗争是“本来革命被整成了反革命”的谎话。乔兴立说：王惟一的社会历史关系很复杂，曾和国民党特务、上层人物经常接触，参加过极其反动的“主流社”；平日有过很反动的言论。他的家庭也很落后，像这样的人不应该审查清楚吗？
    在辩论会上，许多同志揭露了王惟一的反动言行。史纪夏同志说：王惟一曾经攻击我们国家的人民民主制度；他讥笑肃反中被斗的同志是“软骨头”，以煽动这些同志的不满情绪。张惠民说：王惟一是希望天下大乱，他仇恨党，仇视社会主义。
