Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 1st: Gansu Province's first modern dairy factory, the Gannan Dairy Factory, officially began production today after two years and ten months of construction.

    The factory is located in Hezuo City on the Gannan grassland and is one of the larger dairy factories in China. The factory's production process is mechanized and has complete hygiene and disinfection equipment. As soon as milk enters the factory, the quality and acidity are tested by the laboratory. From raw milk to finished products, all places that come into contact with the milk are tightly connected using stainless steel pipes. The factory produces more than four tons of milk powder and more than three tons of butter per day.

    The Gannan Dairy Factory has a sufficient milk supply. According to imprecise statistics, there are four to five million dairy cows within a thirty-kilometer radius. Calculating that each dairy cow produces 400 kilograms of milk per year, after deducting what the local Tibetans consume themselves, there will still be a surplus to supply the factory's needs.

    The factory's commencement of production will increase the income of the Tibetan people in Gannan and improve their lives. At the same time, the factory has also absorbed some young Tibetan workers.

    甘南乳品厂投入生产
    据新华社兰州1日电  甘肃省第一座现代化的乳品厂——甘南乳品厂，经过两年零十个月的建设，在今天正式投入生产。
    这座工厂位于甘南草原上的合作市，是我国目前较大的乳品厂之一。这个工厂的生产过程是机械化的，有完善的卫生消毒设备。牛奶一进厂就要经过化验室化验质量和酸度，从原奶到成品，凡是接触牛奶的地方，都是采用不锈钢的管道严密接连。这个工厂日产四吨多奶粉和三吨多黄油。
    甘南乳品厂的奶源充足，据不精确的统计，光是周围三十公里以内，就有四、五万头奶牛，按一头奶牛一年生产四百公斤牛奶计算，除掉当地藏民自己食用以外，供应工厂需要以后还有剩余。
    这座工厂的投入生产，将使甘南藏民增加收入，改善生活。同时，这个工厂还吸收了一部分藏族青年工人。
