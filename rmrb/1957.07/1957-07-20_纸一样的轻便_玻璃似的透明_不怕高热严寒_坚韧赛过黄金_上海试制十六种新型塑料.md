Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Fangyi reports: This year, Shanghai's plastics industry will trial-produce sixteen new types of plastic, some of which have only appeared in the world in recent years.

Many of the plastics being trialed this year can be used to make lightweight and beautiful daily necessities. Currently, engineers in plastic laboratories are researching and trial-producing "Nylon," "Dacron," and "Terylene." Clothing made from these plastics is as light and thin as paper, yet very strong. The polyethylene plastic, which has recently begun trial production, has a wide range of uses and can be made into glass dishes, glass kettles, glass washbasins, and glass raincoats. These plastic products will not soften or freeze and crack in environments of 80 degrees Celsius or minus 60 degrees Celsius; even if a car flattens them, they can return to their original shape.

"Polychlorinated methyl acrylate resin," which has already been used in the aviation industry abroad, has also been included in Shanghai's plastics industry's trial production plan for this year, and small samples have already been made. This plastic is as light as wood and as transparent as glass, and it is not easily broken. It is a new material for building houses, cars, and ships.

Epoxy resin, known as "universal glue," has been successfully trial-produced at the China Bakelite Factory. The factory's technicians conducted an experiment: they glued two aluminum plates together with "universal glue," and then hung a very heavy object below. As a result, although the aluminum plates cracked, the cracks were not at the glued area. It can replace welding and rivets to manufacture airplanes and ships, and it can also glue cut fabrics into clothing. This "universal glue" and polytetrafluoroethylene plastic, known as the "king of plastics," are two of the more important trial production projects for Shanghai's plastics industry this year. The "king of plastics" has particularly strong corrosion resistance, and even "aqua regia," which can dissolve gold, cannot harm it.

Many of the raw materials for these sixteen types of plastic can be extracted from the waste gas of the Shanghai Refinery, some can be obtained from the rice husks of Shanghai's rice mills, some are corn cobs, and some are chemical raw materials that Shanghai has already produced. This provides raw material conditions for Shanghai to produce these plastics in large quantities in the future.

As one of the key development areas of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Chemical Industry, Shanghai's plastics industry is currently undertaking the reconstruction of some of Shanghai's original chemical plants and is preparing to establish a plastics industrial system near the Shanghai Refinery that utilizes refinery waste gas. Some of the sixteen types of plastic being trialed this year will begin small-scale production in the fourth quarter of this year, and it is estimated that the annual output during the Second Five-Year Plan will be at least several thousand tons.

### 纸一样的轻便  玻璃似的透明  不怕高热严寒  坚韧赛过黄金  上海试制十六种新型塑料

    纸一样的轻便  玻璃似的透明  不怕高热严寒  坚韧赛过黄金
    上海试制十六种新型塑料
    新华社上海17日电  新华社记者徐方义报道：今年，上海塑料工业要试制的新型塑料有十六种，其中有几种还是世界上近几年来才出现的。
    在今年试制的塑料中很多可以用来做一些轻便、美观的生活用品。目前，塑料实验室的工程师们正在研究试制“尼龙”、“丽绚”和“特瑞林”。这些塑料做成的衣衫，像纸一般的轻薄，而又很牢。最近开始试制的聚乙烯塑料，用途很广，可以做成玻璃碟子、玻璃水壶、玻璃面盆和玻璃雨衣等产品。这些塑料制品在摄氏八十度或零下六十度的环境里，不会软化或冻裂；即使汽车把它们压扁了，也能够恢复原状。
    在国外已经用在航空工业上的“聚氯代丙烯酸甲酯树脂”，也列入了上海塑料工业今年的试制计划，目前已经做出小样。这种塑料能够像木材般的轻便和玻璃似的透明，不易碎裂，是造房屋、汽车和轮船等的新材料。
    号称“万能胶”的环氧树脂，已经在中国胶木厂试制成功。厂里的技术人员作了一次试验：把两块铝板用“万能胶”胶起来，下面再挂上很重的物体，结果铝板虽然裂开了，但裂纹不是胶合的地方。它可以代替电焊、铆钉来制造飞机和轮船，也可以把裁好的布料粘成衣服。这种“万能胶”和被称为“塑料之王”的聚四氟乙烯塑料，是今年上海塑料工业两个较重要的试制项目。“塑料之王”耐腐蚀的性能特别强，连把黄金都能溶化的“王水”也奈何它不得。
    这十六种塑料的原料，有许多可以从上海炼油厂的废气中提取，有的可以从上海的碾米厂的砻糠中取得，有的是苞米的芯子，有些是上海早已生产的化工原料。这给上海将来大量生产这些塑料提供了原料条件。
    作为化学工业部和上海市化学工业局重点发展之一的上海塑料工业，目前，一方面在着手改建上海一部分原有的化工厂，一方面准备在上海炼油厂附近建立一个利用炼油废气的塑料工业体系。今年试制的十六种塑料中，一部分在今年第四季度就开始小批生产，预计在第二个五年计划期间的年产量至少有几千吨。
