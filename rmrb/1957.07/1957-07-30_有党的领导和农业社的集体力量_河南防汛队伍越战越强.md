Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Qiao Jianyuan reports: Nearly one million people in Henan Province have been fighting floods for more than twenty days. In this struggle, responsible persons from Party and government leading organs, along with many Communist Party members, have consistently stood in the most critical areas, leading and organizing the masses to protect dikes, conduct emergency rescue, drain waterlogged areas, and rush to replant crops. As a result, despite the very serious flood situation, the morale of the masses remains high, and the flood control teams grow stronger with each battle.

    Zhao Wenfu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Henan Province, Shi Xiangsheng, and Bi Zhanyun, head of Henan Garrison, are responsible for organizing and directing the flood control struggle. Other responsible persons from the province, special districts, and counties have also led the masses in a tenacious fight against the flood. The Sha River area is one of the most tense regions. The floodwaters from the upper reaches of the Sha River threaten the Luhe Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, as well as the safety of the cities of Luhe and Zhoukou and large rural areas. However, hundreds of thousands of cadres and masses along the Sha River dike, under the command of leaders from the province and special districts, worked day and night to raise the dikes, finally protecting the Luhe Railway Bridge and the dikes downstream of Luhe City. Similar intense battles have also unfolded along the banks of the Huiji River, the North Ru River, the Ying River, the Wo River, and the Jialu River. Kong Xiangming, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Lan考 County Committee, and Zhang Zhenli, Deputy Director of the Lushan Epidemic Prevention Station, gloriously sacrificed their lives in the rescue efforts. In some areas, the Party and government have also worked hard to solve the difficulties faced by disaster victims, such as housing and firewood. Therefore, the farmers are full of confidence, saying: With the leadership of the Communist Party and the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives, we will surely be victorious.

    During these days, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in various localities directly participated in the rescue struggle, and the Air Force undertook the task of air-dropping flood control materials. When a certain unit stationed in Xinyang heard that the Gui Li section of the Lao Wangpo flood storage area had breached, they immediately organized a 600-person rescue team and rushed to the breach overnight.

    Currently, some river breaches in Henan Province have not yet been closed, and the waterlogging is also very severe. To this end, all localities have organized two teams, one responsible for closing the breaches and draining the water, and the other for production and self-reliance. The CPC Henan Provincial Committee has also transferred a group of cadres from provincial-level organs to twenty-six counties with more serious disaster situations to assist local Party committees in strengthening leadership over flood control and production relief work, which will continue until the autumn harvest. At present, in addition to continuing to protect dikes and close breaches, the people in the disaster areas are seizing the time to drain water and save seedlings, and rush to plant late autumn crops.

    有党的领导和农业社的集体力量
    河南防汛队伍越战越强
    据新华社郑州28日电　新华社记者乔建元报道：河南省近百万人已经和洪水搏斗了二十多天。在这场斗争中，党、政领导机关的负责人和许多共产党员始终站在最紧急的地方，带领和组织群众守护堤防，抢险救灾，排涝抢种。因此，尽管汛情非常严重，群众情绪仍然高涨，防汛队伍越战越强。
    中共河南省委员会书记处书记、河南省副省长赵文甫、史向生，河南驻军首长毕占云等负责组织和指挥防汛斗争。其他一些省、专区和县的党、政、军负责人也纷纷带领群众一起向洪水作顽强的搏斗。沙河沿线是最紧张的地区之一。沙河上游下来的洪水，威胁着京汉铁路漯河铁桥，以及漯河、周口两市和大片农村的安全。但是沿沙河堤线上的几十万干部和群众，在省和专区等负责人的指挥下，夜以继日地加高堤防，终于把漯河铁桥和漯河市以下的堤防守护住了。在惠济河、北汝河、颍河、涡河、贾鲁河等河的沿岸，也展开了同样的紧张的战斗。中共兰考县委员会农村工作部副部长孔祥明、鲁山防疫站副站长张振立，在抢险中光荣地献出了自己的生命。有些地区的党和政府还努力解决灾民的住房、烧柴等困难。因此农民充满信心，说：有共产党的领导，有农业社的集体力量，我们就一定能够胜利。
    在这些日子里，驻在各地的解放军陆军直接参加了抢险斗争，空军担任了空投防汛物资的任务。当驻信阳某部听说老王坡蓄洪区的桂李段决口时，立即组织六百人的抢险队，连夜赶赴决口地段。
    现在，河南省还有一些河道决口没有堵复，而内涝积水也很严重。为此，各地都组织两套人马，分管堵口排涝和生产自救。中共河南省委员会还从省直属机关抽调一批干部，分赴二十六个灾情较重的县份，协助当地党委加强对防汛和生产救灾工作的领导，一直坚持到秋收。目前灾区各地人民除继续护堤、堵口外，正抓紧时间排水救苗，抢种晚秋作物。
