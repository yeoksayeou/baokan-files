The anti-Rightist struggle is developing towards all levels and regions of the country. This is a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Socialism cannot be consolidated by having only a socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production without a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; if the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts cannot be victorious, socialism has no hope.

The socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts involves everyone in the country, and everyone must pass the socialism test. The Chinese Communist Party is the organizer and leader of this revolutionary struggle, and the attitude taken by each Party member in this struggle is a major political test. Every Party member must also pass the socialism test.

Some well-intentioned comrades seem to think that Rightists only exist outside the Party, only in the ranks of the bourgeoisie, democratic parties, and intellectuals who have not been reformed, and that there will be no Rightists within the Communist Party. But this view does not conform to the facts. Many Rightists within the Party have already been exposed in the anti-Rightist struggle in various places.

Isn't our Communist Party the most thoroughgoing leftist? Yes, the Communist Party is a revolutionary force that adheres to socialism and communism, and is the most reliable pillar for leading the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Communists should of course all be leftists. In fact, the vast majority of our Party members are staunch communists. They have led the masses in heroic struggles against imperialists and counter-revolutionary forces in previous revolutionary struggles. In this anti-Rightist struggle, they are also together with the broad masses of working people and revolutionary intellectuals, waging a resolute struggle against the bourgeois Rightists. But it cannot be denied that some Party members' positions are not clear and firm, and they are vague in their understanding and weak in their attitude in such a serious struggle; there are also a very few people who, while hanging the signboard of "Communist Party member," actually stand on the reactionary bourgeois position. When the bourgeois Rightists attacked the Party, they became shameful internal collaborators.

Why does this phenomenon occur?

The Party is not independent of society. Although the Party often pays attention to strictly selecting and educating Party members, it cannot completely prevent some unreliable elements from mixing into the Party, nor can it completely prevent some Party members from degenerating and changing. When the revolutionary situation, tasks, and nature change, and various social forces are reorganized, this change, this reorganization, will inevitably be reflected within the Party.

A few people join the Party not really for the benefit of the revolution. These people will betray the Party when their personal interests conflict with the interests of the revolution; a few people only agree with part of the Party's program, but do not agree with the entire program of the Party. When the Party implements those programs they disagree with, they will betray the Party; there are also a few people who, in the long period of revolutionary struggle, cannot consistently maintain close contact with the masses of people, cannot consistently maintain a strong revolutionary will. They are influenced by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, cannot withstand great storms, and will betray the Party at the critical moment of the struggle. Such a situation has occurred in every revolutionary period of the Party. After the failure of the revolution in 1927, many Party members betrayed the Party or left the Party, and there were well-known traitors like Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. In the land reform struggle in the Liberated Areas, many Party members also lost their stand, stood on the side of the landlords against the peasants, and were therefore expelled from the Party. The socialist revolution is a revolution that is much deeper and more difficult than the bourgeois democratic revolution. Therefore, it is not surprising that some Party members who joined the Party with personal plans, some Party members who can only participate in the democratic revolution, and some Party members who are corrupted by bourgeois ideology and lose their revolutionary will, will leave the Party in this revolutionary struggle. Moreover, this is of great benefit to the consolidation and purification of our Party ranks. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Those wavering elements who are unwilling to continue working have withdrawn from the Party. The majority of steadfast Party members are better united and fighting. Why is this not good?"

The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact that many Rightists within the Party do not declare their Rightist stance, nor do they declare that they want to withdraw from the Party. Their bourgeois Rightist face is not easily detected in the normal circumstances, just like a fish sinking to the bottom of the water. This time, the bourgeois Rightists, under the pretext of helping the Party to rectify its style of work, launched a rampant attack on the Communist Party and socialism. This is a fierce battle between the capitalist road and the socialist road in China, and it is a fierce battle between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In the great storm of class struggle, people's positions are more distinct. The Rightists within the Party have revealed their true colors. In the rectification movement, they used the individual and partial shortcomings and errors in the Party's life and national life, colluded with the Rightists outside the Party, and launched a two-pronged attack on the Party from within and without.

Obviously, we must treat the Rightists within the Party with a serious attitude, and we must draw a strict line between ourselves and the Rightists in ideology and politics, and wage a resolute struggle against them. But now there are still a few people who feel that the Rightists within the Party can be tolerated somewhat, and it is not necessary to counterattack them as severely as the Rightists outside the Party. This view is wrong. There can be no sentimentalism towards the Rightists outside the Party, and there can be no sentimentalism towards the Rightists within the Party either. Everyone knows that the fortress is easiest to capture from within. If the core of the Party collapses and the leadership of the proletariat is lost, the fortress can be broken without being attacked. In order to prevent the Party's body from being corrupted by the Rightists, and to maintain the Party's ideological and political purity, it is necessary to launch a struggle against the Rightists inside and outside the Party "without discrimination."

The counterattack against the Rightists outside the Party should not take simple and rash methods, and similarly, for the Rightists within the Party, it should not be simple and rash. The most effective way to isolate the Rightists is to fully expose the facts and conduct reasoning and criticism. In the struggle against the Rightists within the Party, the real Rightists must never be treated with sentimental indulgence, but people who are not Rightists must never be classified as Rightists.

This anti-Rightist struggle is a vivid class education for our entire Party. True gold fears no fire. This struggle is a great furnace for smelting true gold. The Rightists within the Party only account for a very small number. In the Party organizations of many units, there is not even a single Rightist. But to varying degrees, right-leaning ideas and right-leaning emotions are expressed on various issues, and they waver at the slightest disturbance. This is by no means the case with just a very small number of people within the Party. All kinds of bourgeois ideas still have a considerable market in many of our Party organizations. Therefore, every Party member should conduct a self-examination through this struggle, correct erroneous views, and raise their revolutionary consciousness, so that the ideological and political level of our Party can be greatly improved.

Communist Party members must adhere to the proletarian communist stance, maintain close contact with the masses of people, must overcome bourgeois individualism and liberalism, always maintain vigor, and always have a strong revolutionary will, otherwise they are not a true Communist Party member. All communists who are willing to devote themselves to the great socialist cause must, in the anti-Rightist struggle, resolutely obey the leadership of the Party, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and enable our country's socialist revolution to achieve a fundamental victory on the political and ideological fronts through this national debate.

### 反右派斗争是对于每个党员的重大考验

    反右派斗争是对于每个党员的重大考验
    反右派斗争正在向全国各阶层、各地方发展。这是政治战线上和思想战线上的一次伟大的社会主义革命。只有生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，没有政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，社会主义是不能巩固的；政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命如果不能胜利，社会主义是没有希望的。
    政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命涉及到全国每一个人，每一个人都要过社会主义这一关。中国共产党是这一次革命斗争的组织者和领导者，每一个党员在这场斗争中采取什么态度是一个重大的政治上的考验，每一个党员也要过社会主义这一关。
    有一些好心的同志似乎认为右派分子只有党外才有，只有在资产阶级、民主党派和没有经过改造的知识分子的队伍中才有，而在共产党内部是不会有的。可是这个看法不符合事实。各地在反右派斗争中已经揭发出许多党内的右派分子了。
    难道我们共产党不是最彻底的左派吗？是的，共产党是坚持社会主义和共产主义的革命力量，是领导社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最可靠的支柱，共产党人当然都应该是左派。事实上，我们党的绝大多数党员是坚定的共产主义者，他们在历次革命斗争中领导群众向帝国主义者和反革命势力英勇搏斗，在这次反右派斗争中也同广大劳动人民和革命知识分子在一起，向资产阶级右派作坚决的斗争。但是不能否认，也有一部分党员的立场却并不是明确的坚定的，他们在这样严重的斗争中认识模糊，态度软弱；还有极少数的人虽然挂着“共产党员”的招牌，实际上却站在反动的资产阶级立场上，当资产阶级右派向党进攻的时候，他们成了可耻的内应。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？
    党不是独立在社会之外的。党虽然经常注意严格地挑选党员和教育党员，但是究竟不能完全防止一些不可靠的分子混入党内，也不能完全防止一些党员的堕落变质。当革命的形势、任务、性质发生变化，各种社会力量重新改组的时候，这种变化，这种改组，必然也会反映到党内来。
    有少数人参加党实际上并不是为了革命的利益，这些人在他们个人的利益同革命的利益发生冲突的时候就会背叛党；有少数人只同意党的一部分纲领，而并不同意党的整个纲领，在党实现那些他们所不同意的纲领的时候，他们就会背叛党；还有少数人在革命斗争的长时期中，不能始终一贯地保持同人民群众的密切联系，不能始终一贯地保持坚强的革命意志，他们受了资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想影响，经不起大风大浪，在斗争的紧要关头就会背叛党。这样的情形，在党的各个革命时期都曾经出现过。在1927年革命失败以后，曾经有许多党员背叛党或者离开党，并且出现过像陈独秀、张国焘这样的人所共知的叛徒。在解放区的土地改革斗争中，也曾有不少党员丧失立场，站在地主方面反对农民，因而被开除出党。社会主义革命是一次比资产阶级民主革命深刻得多困难得多的革命。因此，一些抱着个人打算入党的党员，一些只能参加民主革命的党员，一些受资产阶级思想腐蚀、丧失革命意志的党员，在这次革命斗争中离开党的队伍是毫不奇怪的。而且，这对于我们党的队伍的巩固和纯洁，还有很大的利益。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中说：“那些动摇分子不愿意继续干下去了，退党了，大多数坚定的党员更好团结奋斗，为什么不好呢？”
    问题的困难倒是在于，党内的许多右派分子并不声明自己的右派立场，并不声明要求退出党的队伍。他们的资产阶级右派面目，在通常的情况下不容易被彻底发觉，就好像鱼沉在水底一样。这一次，资产阶级右派借口帮助党整风，向共产党和社会主义发起了猖狂的进攻。这是资本主义道路和社会主义道路在中国的一次恶战，是中国资产阶级和无产阶级的一次恶战。在阶级斗争的大风暴中，人们的立场比较鲜明了。党内的右派分子，这才把真面目表露出来了。他们在整风运动中，利用党的生活和国家生活中个别的、局部的缺点、错误，同党外右派联成一气，向党实行了内外夹攻。
    很明显，我们必须用严肃的态度来对待党内的右派分子，必须在思想上政治上和右派分子严格划清界限，并且向他们进行坚决的斗争。可是现在还有少数人觉得对党内的右派分子似乎可以宽容些，不必要像对党外右派一样地给以反击，这种意见是错误的。对党外右派不能有温情主义，对党内的右派分子同样不能有温情主义。谁都知道，堡垒最容易从内部夺取。如果党的核心瓦解了，无产阶级领导权丧失了，堡垒就可以不攻自破了。为了使党的肌体不被右派分子腐蚀，为了保持党在思想上、政治上的纯洁，必须对党内外的右派分子“一视同仁”地展开斗争。
    对党外右派分子的反击，不应当采取简单急躁的方法，同样，对于党内右派分子，也不应当简单急躁。孤立右派分子最有效的方法，是充分揭露事实，进行说理批判。在对党内右派的斗争中，真正的右派分子决不可温情放过，但也决不可把不是右派分子的人划入右派。
    这次反右派的斗争对于我们全党是一次生动的阶级教育。真金不怕火炼，这次斗争是冶炼真金的大熔炉。党内的右派分子只占极少数，在许多单位的党组织内，甚至一个右派分子也没有。但是在种种问题上表现不同程度的右倾思想、右倾情绪，一有风吹草动就摇摆不定，在党内就远不是极少数人的事了。各色各样的资产阶级思想，在我们许多党组织内还有相当市场。因此，每一个党员都应该通过这次斗争进行检查，纠正错误观点，提高革命觉悟，使我们的党的思想、政治水平大大地提高一步。
    共产党员一定要坚持无产阶级的共产主义的立场，密切联系人民群众，一定要克服资产阶级的个人主义和自由主义，永远保持朝气，永远具有坚强的革命意志，否则就不是一个名副其实的共产党员。凡是愿意献身于伟大的社会主义事业的共产主义者，一定要在反右派斗争中，坚决地服从党的领导，站在斗争的最前线，使我国的社会主义革命，通过这一次全民性的大辩论，在政治战线上和思想战线上取得根本的胜利。
