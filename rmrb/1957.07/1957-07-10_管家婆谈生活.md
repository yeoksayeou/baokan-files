    Housekeeper Discusses Life
    Tian Wu
    I am the family member of a non-Party senior intellectual, a housekeeper. What housekeepers plan in their minds, mutter in their mouths, and fiddle with in their hands are always about the family's food, drink, and clothing. As long as she is a housekeeper in name and in fact, even if she is not very clever, she is always sensitive to changes in life. So, since liberation, has everyone's life improved, and is the improvement limited to Party members who used to wear broken shoes but now wear wool uniforms and ride in cars? Housekeepers will be a group of powerful witnesses. I am one of the witnesses. I speak based on my personal experience of the changes in life over the past decade.

    What was life like before liberation? My answer is that we were constantly navigating obstacles:

    Navigating the "big head" [silver dollar] obstacle. "Gold yuan notes" were like waste paper, prices were like wild horses, and the people were like river fish about to be stranded as the water dried up. Immediately exchanging salaries for silver dollars was the struggle of people who depended on wages to maintain their lives. Exchanging silver dollars required squeezing and grabbing; otherwise, you couldn't get them. You had to learn to "listen to the sound of the bones" [note]; otherwise, even if you managed to grab them, they were often fake.

    Navigating the store obstacle. Merchants liked silver dollars but not "small change." You had to pay a discount when buying things with small change. To avoid losing out, housekeepers often left a silver dollar in the store first, and then took goods, half a pound of oil today, a pound of vegetables tomorrow. The account was wrong, the weight was short, there was sand in the rice, white clay in the flour... originally a fair transaction, it felt like enemies meeting.

    Navigating the weather obstacle. When it got hot, the grain would get worms and mold; if you didn't buy more, you were afraid of price increases, but if you bought too much, you couldn't beat the weather. With little coal and no firewood, we used kerosene for cooking. It was so cold that water dripped and froze in the house, but we had to endure it. Who could afford to heat a fire!

    Navigating the unemployment obstacle. Blacklists were everywhere, imprisonment and beheadings were not uncommon, and losing one's job was even more commonplace. If the "head of the household" was unemployed for a month, hungry ghosts would come knocking on the door looking for a replacement.

    Big obstacles nested with small obstacles, protecting each other. If one obstacle couldn't be overcome, there was a problem with life. Thinking about food, thinking about clothing, looking at the old, looking at the young, my nerves as a housekeeper were tense even in my sleep.

    What is life like after liberation? It is the opposite of before: big obstacles and small obstacles have collapsed together. Prices have stabilized; merchants have become reasonable, and later they were even jointly owned by the public and private sectors; salaries are paid on time, and have been adjusted and increased repeatedly. In my family in recent years, we have had enough to eat and enough to wear, and we have savings in the bank; we used to eat two pounds of fish for four days, but now we eat four pounds of fish for two days; we used to have ice and snow on the ground in the house in winter, but now, even in winter, the house is as warm as spring.

    The housekeeper's knowledge is shallow, but she understands life. People must have a conscience, and if they have a conscience, they tell the truth. I cannot listen to the right-wingers' distortion of facts and nonsense. I use my personal experience to shatter this malicious delirium.

    [Note] Insiders can recognize the authenticity of silver dollars from the tactile sensation of the hand and the sound of two silver dollars touching each other.

    管家婆谈生活
    天吴
    我是个党外高级知识分子的家属，是个管家婆。管家婆们心里盘算的，口里叨念的，手里拨弄的总归一家人的吃喝穿戴。只要是名实相副的管家婆，尽管她的心眼不够，但对生活的变化永远是敏感的。那末，解放以来，大家的生活有没有提高，提高的是否只限于从前穿破鞋、现在穿呢制服、坐小汽车的党员？管家婆们将是群有力的证人。我是证人之一。我凭十年来亲身体验到的生活变化来说话。
    解放前的生活怎样呢？我的回答是时时刻刻在闯关：
    闯“大头”的关。“金元券”像废纸，物价像野马，人民像水将干涸的河鱼。领到金元券立时换大头是靠薪水维持生活的人在死前的挣扎。换大头要挤、要抢，不这样弄不到手；要学会“揣骨听声”〔注〕，不这样，纵然抢到手也常是假的。
    闯商店的关。商人欢喜大头，不欢喜“小角子”，拿小角子买东西要打折扣。为了少吃亏，管家婆们常常是先放块大头在店里，然后，今天半斤油，明天一斤菜地取货。帐记错啦，秤头低啦，米中有沙啦，面中有白土啦，……本是公平交易，竟仿佛冤家对头。
    闯天气的关。天热了，粮食要生虫，发霉；不多买点，怕涨价，买多了斗不过天气。少煤无柴，烧饭用火油，冷到屋里滴水成冰，还得硬挺着，谁烤得起火！
    闯失业的关。黑名单满天飞，坐牢、砍头不稀奇，砸饭碗更是家常便饭。“当家的”失业一个月，饿死鬼就会来敲门找替身。
    大关套小关，“关关”相卫，一关闯不过，生活有问题。想着吃的，念着穿的，看看老的，望望小的，我这个管家婆的根根神经连在睡梦里也是紧张的。
    解放后的生活怎样呢？和从前倒个个：大关、小关一齐垮了。物价稳定了；商人变得讲理了，后来竟公私合营了；薪水按时发，而且一再调整提高。我家最近几年来，吃有吃的，穿有穿的，银行里有存的；从前两斤鱼吃四天，现在四斤鱼吃两天；从前一到冬天，屋里是冰雪在地，现在虽到冬天，屋里还温暖如春。
    管家婆的见识是浅的，但她认识生活。人要有良心，有良心就说真话。我听不下去右派分子歪曲事实的胡说八道，我用我的亲身经历来粉碎这种恶毒的呓语。
    〔注〕内行的人可以从手的触觉与两块银元相触击的声音上认出大头的真假来。
