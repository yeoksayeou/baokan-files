    Huaibei Discovers New Coalfield
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch on the 18th) On the vast Huaibei Plain, exploration teams have discovered a large coalfield spanning the three counties of Suxian, Suixi, and Mengcheng, covering an area of 150 square kilometers.
    This large coalfield is only 20 kilometers away from the Zhahe coalfield, which was discovered not long ago and covers an area of 200 square kilometers (previously mistakenly reported as 120 square kilometers). Initial estimates suggest that the total reserves of this coalfield are approximately 1.9 billion tons, with proven reserves currently exceeding 400 million tons. The coal seams are more numerous than those in the Zhahe coalfield, with eight or nine coal seams already discovered. Among them, four or five are mineable coal seams, with a total thickness of 10 meters. All are bituminous coal, and some can be used for coking.
    Drilling workers active in this new coalfield are working day and night, continuously operating large drilling rigs and drilling into the earth, striving to thoroughly explore the reserves of this coalfield as soon as possible.

    淮北发现新煤田
    本报合肥18日电  在辽阔的淮北平原上，勘探队员又发现了跨越宿县、濉溪、蒙城三县面积达一百五十平公方里的大煤田。
    这块大煤田与不久前发现的面积为二百平方公里的闸河煤田（前误为一百二十平方公里），仅隔二十公里。初步估计，这块煤田的总储量大约有十九亿吨左右，目前已探明的储量达四亿吨以上。煤层比闸河煤田多，已探明的就有八、九槽煤。其中有四、五槽是可采煤层，可采煤层的总厚度达十公尺。全部是烟煤，有一部分可作炼焦用煤。
    活跃在这块新煤田上的钻探工人，正在日日夜夜不停地操纵着大型钻机，向地心钻进，争取早日彻底探明这块煤田的储量。
