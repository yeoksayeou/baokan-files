I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Ulanhu.

Recently, some rightist elements, taking advantage of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's call for a rectification movement throughout the Party to listen to opinions from non-Party members in order to improve work and better carry out socialist construction, have venomously issued anti-Party and anti-socialist statements, obliterating the splendid achievements made by the Party in leading the people of the whole country in socialist transformation and socialist construction over the past few years. They are attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party, restore the evil bourgeois rule, and re-enslave the people, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country.

As a technical worker in the power industry, faced with the great construction achievements of China's power industry since liberation, I express extreme indignation at the rightist elements' slander that the first Five-Year Plan was a mess and that the shortcomings are the main thing.

Now I will briefly talk about the achievements of the power industry in recent years, using ironclad facts to answer the rightist elements' slander against the Party and the people.

Achievements in Power Industry Construction in Recent Years Exceed the Total of the Previous Sixty Years

The current power industry production capacity has exceeded the 15.9 billion kilowatt-hours stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, equivalent to three times the highest annual output before liberation (1941). The planned power generation for the whole of 1957 is 2.6 times the power generation in 1952. If the power generation of the Shuifeng Hydropower Station is deducted, 1957 is 2.4 times that of 1952. The average annual increase rate over five years is 22.1 percent. Such a high growth rate has not been seen in the development of the power industry in any country in the world. The three main indicators that mark the technological level of power industry production, namely, the power consumption rate of power plants, the line loss rate, and the coal consumption rate, have already reached the original 1957 level in 1956. In just a few years of construction, the installed capacity of newly added power generation equipment in the country has exceeded the total built during the sixty years of reactionary rule before liberation.

Let's look at the achievements in power industry capital construction. Representative Yu Kaiquan has already talked about the achievements in hydropower in his speech, so I won't repeat them. In terms of thermal power generation alone, a large part of the power plants built in the first Five-Year Plan are high-pressure, high-temperature, and large-capacity, and are equipped with automated, mechanized, and modernized equipment. Such complex construction techniques that require very strict requirements were not possible before liberation, but with the help of Soviet experts, one project after another has been successfully completed. In addition, the construction of many power plants is aided by democratic countries or domestic design and manufacturing of equipment, and they are also being completed one after another.

In the four years of the first Five-Year Plan, more than 2,300 kilometers of 110,000-volt to 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission lines were built, and more than 900,000 kVA of 110,000-volt to 220,000-volt substations were constructed. Such a large project was only done during the period of Japanese imperialist rule in Northeast China, and never in the old China.

In such large-scale construction, in just a few years, a large design and construction force has been cultivated from scratch. At present, in the capital construction system of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry alone, it can simultaneously carry out the construction projects of about fifteen thermal power plants, the construction of ten ultra-high-voltage transmission lines of more than 100 kilometers above 110,000 volts, and the construction of ten substations of more than 110,000 volts. The design capability can fully undertake the engineering projects in the second Five-Year Plan, including high-pressure and high-temperature power plants and several projects originally designed by foreign countries. The 110,000-volt to 220,000-volt transmission lines and substations can also be fully designed.

The reason why the power industry has achieved such rapid development is due to the leadership of the Party, the assistance of the Soviet Union, and the efforts of all technical personnel and the broad masses of workers. This also clearly proves that the Party is fully capable of leading science and technology. We technical personnel engaged in the power industry are basically trusted by the Party and have played our role. And it is precisely these old intellectuals who are playing a backbone role in construction. Why were they not able to develop before liberation? Doesn't this fully illustrate that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and only under the superior socialist system can intellectuals develop, and can China's power industry have such large-scale and high-speed development?

The achievements of our power industry construction are due to learning from the Soviet Union. In the future, we should continue to learn from the Soviet Union. The problem is that we must combine it with China's specific conditions. Denying the achievements gained from learning from the Soviet Union in the past, saying that learning from the Soviet Union is dogmatism, is a completely revisionist viewpoint and is wrong. We must resolutely oppose it.

We power industry technical workers resolutely oppose all reactionary remarks and thoughts of rightist elements. However, while fighting these reactionary remarks and thoughts, we deeply feel that technical workers must establish a communist worldview in order to truly serve socialist construction. And I feel that my ideological level is still very low, and my proletarian stand is not very firm. And how can some people who overestimate themselves and think that their ideological transformation is almost complete, promote their own progress and stand firm on the proletarian stand? Therefore, we must abide by Chairman Mao's instructions, continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist worldview in our work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, gradually integrate with workers and peasants, and dedicate all our strength to the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

Several Opinions on Power Industry Capital Construction

The achievements made in the capital construction of the power industry in the past few years are great and basic, but there are still some problems in the work. Now I would like to put forward some opinions on the existing problems.

1. The speed of development of the power industry in the second Five-Year Plan

During my inspection work last year, after learning about the power shortage in several areas, I proposed in a report to the Standing Committee that the investment in the power industry should be appropriately increased so that the power supply would not lag behind the needs of the load, so as to ensure the speed of national industrialization. This year, the national capital construction investment has been reduced by 20.6 percent compared to last year, and the investment of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has increased by 26.5 percent compared to last year. This shows that the central government attaches importance to the development of the power industry. This is entirely correct.

However, judging from the current arrangements, in the next few years, the power supply in many areas will still be tight. If the greater development of the power industry is not considered, there will be difficulties in ensuring industrial power consumption. Therefore, it is hoped that when arranging the second Five-Year Plan, the construction speed of the power industry will be appropriately accelerated and the investment will be increased so that it can have greater development and truly play the role of leading industry. In particular, we must consider the specific conditions of China's abundant hydropower resources, and developing hydropower has huge benefits. This can also lay the foundation for the further development of the power industry. It is of great significance for ensuring the speed of socialist industrialization.

2. The issue of economy

According to the central government's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy and the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, a lot of funds and materials have been saved in design or construction due to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, adopting new technologies in a timely manner, and taking some measures, and considerable achievements have been made.

However, there are still waste phenomena in design and construction work, and there is a lot of potential for saving. This is mainly because the leadership's understanding of the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily is not deep enough, and it has not been seriously implemented. Some standards are too high, the idea of ​​perfection is too heavy, and it has not been possible to combine China's specific conditions in a timely manner to formulate more appropriate standards, further take saving measures in the work, and earnestly educate the broad masses of workers to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily more deeply.

The cost of equipment accounts for a large proportion of the capital construction investment. However, there are unreasonable phenomena in the capacity matching of domestically manufactured power generation equipment. For example, a 2,500 kW turbine generator set requires 13 tons of steam per hour, but is equipped with a boiler that produces 20 tons per hour. A 6,000 kW generator set requires 29 tons of steam per hour, but is equipped with a boiler that produces 40 tons per hour. A 12,000 kW generator set requires 57 tons of steam per hour, but is equipped with a boiler that produces 75 tons per hour. There are too few series of auxiliary equipment, such as coal mills, fans, and motors and transformers, and there are also similar inappropriate situations in the capacity matching.

This not only wastes considerable funds in power plant construction, but also wastes steel. The First Ministry of Machine Building has begun to pay attention to the issue of machine-furnace matching, and hopes to resolve it quickly. It is also hoped that the product series of auxiliary equipment and motors, etc., can be increased to eliminate the existing unreasonable phenomena. As for the use of domestic equipment, as long as the problem of catching up with the time and the supply of supporting equipment can be solved, we are very welcome.

Regarding the scale of enterprise construction, I fully agree with Vice Premier Bo Yibo's proposal: “The construction of large-scale enterprises should be combined with the construction of medium and small-sized enterprises, and more medium and small-sized enterprises should be built in the future.” In the construction of the power industry, in some areas where the load is still relatively small, the development is not large, and it is not yet connected to the large system in the short term, it is appropriate to consider medium and small-sized power plants in future construction. However, in large systems, the capacity that needs to be increased is relatively large. If medium and small-sized power plants are still built, it will increase construction costs, consume more steel, and occupy more construction and installation forces, affecting the construction speed. Moreover, small units have low efficiency and are not economical to operate, and technically, it will bring difficulties to greater development in the future. According to rough estimates, for every increase in the capacity of thermal power generation equipment, the investment per unit capacity will be reduced by 20 percent. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that if 12,000 kW or 25,000 kW units are used to replace 100,000 kW or even larger units in a large power system like the Northeast, then adding about 1.2 million kW of thermal power generation equipment in the second Five-Year Plan will increase how much investment. The power systems in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou are similar. This also hopes that the manufacturing department can maximize the needs of large-scale units in the construction of the power industry, and strive for greater savings in this regard.

3. Quality issues

In recent years, the basic quality of capital construction of the power industry has been good, and the design level has been continuously improved. The main parts of the project meet the requirements of a century-old plan and are strong and durable, such as the main plant of the power plant and the foundation casting of the main equipment, the installation and balancing of the turbine, etc., are all of very good quality.

However, the quality of construction is not without problems. In many projects, there are still many quality accidents. The level of technology is low, which not only affects the neatness and beauty within the possible range, but also affects the quality. Some projects often require immediate technical improvements after being handed over to production, resulting in waste.

Errors in design drawings have caused many difficulties and losses to construction. Due to subjective one-sidedness in surveying and design work, insufficient collection of original data, insufficient internal and external coordination, the verification system needs to be improved, and the sense of responsibility is not strong enough, the quality of design work needs to be further improved.

In construction and design work, due to the rapid development of the enterprise, there are many new workers and technicians, and the average technical level is low, and technical management work cannot keep up. This is one of the reasons why the quality is not good. Another more important reason is that this issue has not been treated more seriously from the leadership's point of view, and the broad masses of workers have not been educated to ensure design quality and engineering quality in all aspects.

4. Management issues in design and construction work

The fact that the management level cannot keep up with the needs of objective development is also an issue that should be given attention. There is no doubt that the design and construction work of power industry capital construction has established institutions, improved organizations, and initially established systems in terms of technical management, planning management, and administrative management in recent years, and formulated methods. A lot of experience has been explored to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

However, a complete and scientific management system that is specifically designed for the characteristics of design and construction and combined with specific circumstances has not yet been established. For example, the calculation of design workload using unit valuation tables cannot truly reflect the reality of the planned workload, the valuation is too high, and it is easy to overfulfill. Since the plan can be overfulfilled, all levels do not pay enough attention to grasping the work and improving efficiency, resulting in slack work and the phenomenon of planned management being seemingly there but not really there. Also, the reward system, wage system, technical responsibility system, and some technical management systems all need further research.

Also, the leadership has not given enough attention to the improvement of management work, making management personnel not clear about their future and lacking direction for their efforts. The wages of management personnel are much lower than those of technical personnel, which also affects the mood of management personnel. These are all issues that should be paid attention to and resolved.

The above are a few opinions on the capital construction work of the power industry, which are put forward for the representatives' reference. If there are any inappropriate points, please criticize them.

专栏：

    铁的事实粉碎了右派分子的污蔑
    毛鹤年的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长和乌兰夫副总理所作的报告。
    近来一些右派分子乘着中共中央提出全党进行整风运动，听取党外人士对党的意见，以便改进工作，更好地进行社会主义建设的时候，毒恶地发出了反党反社会主义的言论，抹煞党领导全国人民几年来在社会主义改造和社会主义建设上所获得的辉煌成就。妄图推翻党的领导，恢复万恶的资产阶级统治，重新奴役人民，这是全国人民坚决不能容忍的。
    作为一个电力工业的技术工作者，面对着解放以来我国电力工业伟大的建设成就，对于右派分子说是第一个五年计划搞糟了，缺点是主要的等等谰言，表示极大的愤慨。
    现在我简要的讲一讲电力工业几年来的成就，用铁一般的事实来回答右派分子对党对人民的污蔑。
    几年电力工业建设成就超过以前六十年的总和
    目前电力工业生产能力已经超过五年计划规定的一百五十九亿度的水平，相当于解放前最高年（一九四一年）产量的三倍。一九五七年的全年计划发电量是一九五二年发电量的二点六倍。如扣除水丰水电厂的发电量，一九五七年为一九五二年的二点四倍，五年平均，每年递增的上涨率为百分之二十二点一，这样高的增长速度是在世界上任何国家的电力工业发展上所没有的。标志着电力工业生产技术水平的厂用电率、线路损失率和煤耗率三个主要指标也已经在一九五六年就达到了原规定的一九五七年水平。短短几年的建设，全国增加的发电设备容量超过了解放前六十多年反动统治时期所建的总和。
    再看看电力工业基本建设的成就。关于水力发电的成就，于开泉代表已经在他的发言中谈过，不再重复。仅就火力发电来说，第一个五年计划里所建设的发电厂中，很大一部分是高压高温，大容量的，而且是自动化、机械化和现代化装备的电厂。这样复杂的、要求非常严格的施工技术，在解放以前是不会的，但是在苏联专家的帮助下，已经顺利的，一个接着一个工程完成着。还有不少电厂的建设是由民主国家的帮助或者国内自己设计、自己制造的设备，也陆续的完成着。
    在第一个五年计划前四年多的时间里，还修建了二千三百多公里十一万伏到二十二万伏的超高压送电线路，建设了九十多万千伏安十一万伏到二十二万伏的变电站。这样大的工程，除去日本帝国主义统治东北时期还作了一些，在旧中国时代是从来也没有作过的。
    在这样大规模建设中，短短几年里，还从无到有的培养了很大的设计和施工力量。目前仅电力工业部基本建设系统中，同时就可以进行大约十五所火力发电厂的建设工程，十条一百公里以上的十一万伏以上的超高压送电线路的建设，十所十一万伏以上的变电站的建设。设计能力已经完全可以担任第二个五年计划中的工程项目，包括高压高温电厂和几个原定由国外设计的项目。十一万伏到二十二万伏送电线路和变电站也完全可以设计。
    电力工业所以得到这样的高速发展，是在党的领导下、苏联的帮助下、全体技术人员和广大职工群众的努力所获得的。这也清楚的证明了党是完全能够领导科学技术的。我们从事电力工业的技术人员，基本上是被党所信任的，是发挥了我们的作用的。而旧知识分子更是在建设中起着骨干的作用。也正还是这些人，为什么在解放前就没能够得到发展呢？这不是充分说明了只有在共产党的领导下，只有在优越的社会主义社会制度下，知识分子才会得到发展，我国电力工业才能有这样大规模的、高速度的发展。
    我们电力工业建设的成就是由于学习苏联而获得的，今后还应当继续向苏联学习，问题在于我们必须结合中国的具体情况。否认过去学习苏联所获得的成绩，说是学习苏联就是教条主义，这完全是修正主义的观点，是错误的，我们要坚决反对。
    我们电力工业技术工作者，坚决反对一切右派分子的反动言论和思想。但是同这些反动言论和思想进行斗争的同时，深切感到技术工作者必须树立共产主义的世界观，才能真正为社会主义建设服务。并且感到自己的思想水平还是很低，无产阶级立场还不很坚定。而有些人却把自己估计过高，认为思想改造的已经差不多了，这又怎能促使自己进步、站稳无产阶级立场呢？因此我们一定遵照毛主席的指示，继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，把全部力量献给祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    对电力工业基本建设的几点意见
    几年来电力工业基本建设工作所取得的成绩是伟大的，也是基本的，但是在工作中间也还存在着一些问题。现在我就存在的问题中提出几点意见。
    1．电力工业在第二个五年计划中
    发展速度问题
    我在去年视察工作中，了解到几个地区缺电情况后，在给常务委员会的报告中曾提出应当适当的增加电力工业的投资，使电力供应不落后于负荷的需要，以保证国家工业化的速度。今年全国基本建设投资额比去年减少了百分之二十点六，电力工业部的投资比去年增加了百分之二十六点五。这说明中央重视了电力工业的发展。这是完全正确的。
    但是目前看来，按照现在的安排，今后几年里，很多地区的电源还是紧张的，若不考虑电力工业的更大发展，对工业用电的保证上是有困难的。因此希望在安排第二个五年计划的时候，把电力工业的建设速度再适当的加快一些，投资更加多些，以便它能有更大的发展，真能起先行工业的作用。特别是要考虑到我国水力资源丰富这一具体条件，发展水电是有巨大利益的。这样还可以为更远的电力工业的发展打下基础。对保证社会主义工业化的速度是有其重大意义的。
    2．节约问题
    根据中央增产节约的指示，勤俭建国的方针，几年来不论在设计上或是施工上由于发动了群众的积极性，及时地采用了新技术并采取了一些措施，已经节约了大量资金和器材，取得了不小的成绩。
    但是在设计和施工工作中，还存在着浪费现象，有不小的节约潜力，这主要是由于领导上对勤俭建国的方针理解的还不够深，没有认真的贯彻。有些标准过高，求全思想很重，没有能及时的结合我国具体情况，定出更适当的标准，在工作中进一步采取节约措施，并认真教育广大职工更深入地贯彻勤俭建国的方针。
    设备的费用占基本建设投资中很大的比例。但是国内制造的发电设备在容量的配合上是存在着不合理现象的。例如二千五百瓩汽轮机组，每小时蒸汽需要量是十三吨，但配备每小时二十吨的锅炉，六千瓩机组需要蒸汽量是29吨／时，但配备的锅炉是40吨／时，一万二千瓩机组需要蒸汽量是57吨／时，但配备的锅炉是75吨／时。附属设备，如磨煤机、风机以及马达变压器等产品的系列过少，容量的配合上也有同样的不合适情况。
    这样在发电厂建设上不但浪费了很可观的资金，而且浪费了钢材。第一机械工业部已经开始注意机炉配合问题，希望迅速解决。并且附属设备和马达等等的产品系列也希望能增多些，消灭现存的不合理现象。至于国产设备的使用，只要能解决时间赶不上的问题和配套设备的供应问题，我们是十分欢迎的。
    在企业建设规模上，我完全同意薄一波副总理所提出的：“大型企业的建设，要同中、小型企业的建设相结合，并且今后应该多建中、小型企业。”在电力工业的建设上，在一些负荷还比较小，发展不大，短期内又还不联接到大系统中的地区，今后的建设考虑中、小型的电厂是合适的。但是在大系统中，需要增加的容量比较大，如果还是建设中、小型的电厂，那就会既增加了建设费用、多消耗钢材，又要多占用建筑安装力量，影响了建设速度。而且机组小、效率低，运行上也不够经济，在技术上也会给以后更大发展时带来困难。据粗略的估算，火力发电设备的容量，每增大一级，单位容量的投资要降低百分之二十。因此，不难看出，像东北那样大的动力系统，如果用一万二千瓩的机组或是二万五千瓩机组去代替十万瓩以至更大的机组，第二个五年计划以增加一百二十万瓩左右的火力发电设备算下来，那就会增加多少投资了。其他如京、津、唐、张动力系统等也是相类似的。这也就希望制造部门能够最大限度的满足电力工业建设上大型机组的需要，争取在这方面更大的节约。
    3．质量问题
    几年来电力工业基本建设在质量上基本是好的，设计水平也不断提高。工程的主要部分是符合于百年大计、坚固耐久的要求的，如发电厂的主厂房和主要设备的基础浇制，汽轮机的安装、平衡等都作的质量很好。
    但是施工的质量上也还不是没有问题的。在许多工程上，质量事故还不少。工艺技术水平低，这不但影响了在可能范围的整齐、美观，而且就影响了质量。有一些工程往往在移交生产后还要立即作技术改进工作，造成了浪费。
    设计图纸的错误给施工造成了不少的困难和损失。由于勘测设计工作中的主观片面，原始资料收集的不够正确，还有内部和外部联系配合的不够好，校核制度还需要改善，责任心还不够强等等问题，设计工作的质量还需要进一步的改进。
    在施工和设计工作中，由于事业的发展很快，工人和技术人员新手多，平均技术水平低，技术管理工作跟不上，这是质量不够好的一个原因。另外一个更重要的原因是，没有从领导思想上更严肃认真的对待这个问题，教育广大职工，从各方面保证设计质量和工程质量。
    4．设计、施工工作的管理问题
    管理水平跟不上客观发展的需要，也是应该引起重视的一个问题。毫无疑问，电力工业基本建设的设计、施工工作，几年来建立了机构，健全了组织，不论在技术管理、计划管理、行政管理方面，都初步的建立了制度，拟定了办法，已经摸索到不少的经验，从而保证了五年计划的完成。
    但是，针对着设计、施工性质的特点，结合具体情况的、一套完整的、科学的管理制度还没有建立。例如设计工作量用单位估价表来计算，实在不能反映计划工作量的真实性，估价偏高，很容易超额完成。计划既能超额完成，各级就对抓紧工作、提高效率重视不够，造成工作松懈，计划管理似有似无的现象。又如奖励制度、工资制度、技术责任制以及一些技术管理上的制度，也都需要进一步研究。
    还有，领导上对管理工作的提高没有给以足够的重视，使得管理人员对自己的前途不够明确，缺乏努力方向。管理人员的工资比技术人员低的较多，也影响了管理人员的情绪。这都是应当注意解决的。
    以上是几点关于电力工业基本建设工作上的意见，提出来供代表们的参考，如有不妥当的地方，请予以批评。
