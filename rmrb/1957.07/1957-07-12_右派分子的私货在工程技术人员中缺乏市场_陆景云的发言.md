I fully agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and President Dong Biwu on the work of the government, the Sino-Burmese border issue, the budget and final accounts, the economic plan, and the work of the procuratorate and the courts. I also agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and the report on the establishment of two autonomous regions made by Vice Premier Ulanhu. I feel that our government's work, explaining things so clearly and systematically to the people, laying out the problems, pointing out correct and incorrect ideas, proactively analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of our work, and proposing methods and guidelines for improvement and effort, is something that no other form of government can do.

During this meeting, after studying Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," I gained clear standards for right and wrong. Furthermore, listening to the exposure of the right-wingers' conspiracies in group discussions and plenary speeches has greatly enlightened me and raised my level of political understanding.

	Be brave and active in doing things; as long as you contribute to the people, you will not be buried or treated unfairly.

I am an engineering and technical person, and also a non-Party intellectual. One of the points of provocation by the right-wingers against intellectuals is: non-Party intellectuals have positions but no power in their work. Based on my own experience, this is completely untrue. Because the Party and the government trusted me, I was able to participate in and complete the construction of two new factories from beginning to end in the short eight years after liberation. The scale, completeness, and speed of construction of these factories were unimaginable to me before liberation. In these years of work, although there were difficulties and twists and turns, I was able to work freely and bravely take on responsibilities. In my work, I have a clear organizational relationship and division of labor with the factory director. I am in charge of technology, and he is in charge of administration. When the factory director is away, he entrusts me to act on his behalf. I only feel that my ability is insufficient to take care of everything completely. Usually, I can participate in giving opinions on all issues. I am even invited to attend Party committee meetings and Party member representative meetings and speak. Although the confidentiality requirements are very high in my current work, I can know everything, which makes me feel a great responsibility. When there are different opinions between us, we will discuss them, even argue for a while, but this does not hinder our relationship. Everyone knows that this is inevitable in work. I often put forward sharp criticisms of individual bad phenomena I see, which can also play a role in urging improvement. This is true not only for the factory director I work with, but also for the leaders at higher levels. I have never been subjected to any retaliation. My conclusion is: Be brave and active in doing things, without any worries. As long as you can make a real contribution to the people, you will not be buried or treated unfairly in this society. Moreover, I believe that having a position and power does not mean that one is allowed to use one's position and power to realize his personal ambitions. As recently revealed in the newspapers, the right-winger Luo Longji, as Minister of Forest Industry, was unwilling to manage wood, thinking that it buried him; he also wanted to use the position of minister to achieve the purpose of luring private individuals. If he failed to do so, he would follow up with a strike. Such a person is not a good intellectual, and should have neither power nor position.

	Who are our friends, and whose example should we follow?

The right-wingers also talk about how good capitalism is, how good the United States is, and so on; which reminds me of my experience of contacting Americans when I worked for the puppet government in the United States. At that time, I found that what they cared about was entirely business. Once I had no value in their business eyes, they would turn a blind eye; even in talking about business, I had to be vigilant and wary to avoid suffering losses. They also said that we could learn their methods and prosper in the same way. This had once confused me and made me have illusions about them. But later I discovered that the prosperity of their society was initially obtained by plundering the local indigenous people, and now it is maintained by constant trade surpluses, during which they made several war fortunes. Not to mention the cruelty of their war plundering methods and the irrational internal distribution of their society; let's take their so-called natural trade surplus, can every country in the world achieve a surplus like them year after year? Who will be left to bear the opponent of this trade deficit? I didn't understand Marxism-Leninism at that time, but I understood the arithmetic of addition and subtraction. I thought it was impossible for everyone to be adding without subtracting. If someone takes advantage, someone must suffer! I recognized that following them would lead to a dead end, not only would it not work, but it would also be used as a sacrifice. Since there is no way out economically, other things such as their so-called democratic life and personal freedom are empty and deceitful. In fact, when Americans think that China will really catch up with them, they will scream that this is a terrible "yellow peril."

In my current work, when I come into contact with Soviet friends, I find that what they care about is how to make our future better, and even encourage us to surpass them; their attitude is very modest and sincere, not to mention the technology that I can learn from Soviet experts now, which is not even allowed to be seen in the United States. This makes it very clear who our friends are and whose example we should follow.

	Being able to personally participate in the construction boom is the greatest satisfaction in life for engineering and technical personnel.

It seems that the question raised by the right-wingers of whether living standards have declined is very likely to touch the minds of intellectuals. I think the government's care for intellectuals is considerate, and with stable prices, labor insurance benefits in enterprises, low children's education expenses, and so on, these are incomparable items between the old and new societies, and are an improvement in life. Unless they want to live an unhealthy American-style licentious life again, they will never feel that their current life is not as good as before; I also think that this is the only way to keep intellectuals from going down the road of decadence. What's more, for us engineering and technical personnel, being able to be proud of the unprecedented improvement of our country's international status, being able to see the gradual improvement of the lives of the people of the motherland, and the rapid progress of industrial construction, and being able to personally participate in this construction boom and contribute our own strength, is the greatest satisfaction in life. I believe that anyone who has lived in a semi-colonial city like Shanghai for a long time, suffered from the oppression of imperialists, and seen the faces of imperialists and their lackeys, the so-called "superior Chinese," will have such a feeling. Such satisfaction would not be possible without the leadership of the Communist Party, nor could it be maintained for long. The Communist Party liberated us intellectuals from the oppression of imperialists and their lackeys, just as it liberated the peasants from the oppression of the landlords.

Therefore, I believe that the contraband peddled by the right-wingers lacks a market among engineering and technical personnel. With the behavior of old politicians, under the guise of speaking for intellectuals, they first compete for power, then seize profits, and then they must bring in the imperialists, and they themselves become "superior Chinese" again. How can this be agreed by our intellectuals? However, there are still many intellectuals who have been deceived by them, and there are still some intellectuals who have fallen into the mire and joined forces with the right-wingers. For this reason, we must be more vigilant, grasp political theory learning, improve our political sensitivity, distinguish between right and wrong, strengthen our political determination, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, take the initiative to approach the Party organization in our work, maintain normal relations with Party cadres, resolutely implement the Party's policies, do our best in our duties, think of the overall interests of the people in everything, honestly and diligently do our job, correct our attitude towards marching towards science, bring out the youth who will take our place, change our nostalgia for bad lifestyles, and eliminate the possibility of the resurgence of bourgeois ideology; only in this way can we better serve socialist construction, which is the correct path for intellectuals. For the current struggle against the right-wingers, we should participate in it enthusiastically until the final victory.

	How to utilize the surplus labor force in the machinery manufacturing industry?

Here, I would also like to mention my views on the problem of surplus manpower in my country's machinery manufacturing enterprises.

(1) Due to the large number of personnel recruited by various units last year, and the planned production tasks this year are roughly at the same level as last year, most machinery manufacturing plants have a considerable surplus of manpower; if these personnel are not properly utilized, it will be a considerable waste. I believe that the connection between our industrial enterprises and agricultural production is not close enough. Encouraged by the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in the past two years, agricultural cooperatives have added a large number of mechanical farm tools and pumping machinery. These machines are not all used well. In many areas, due to the distance from industrial cities and the poor mechanical knowledge of farmers, some cannot use them, some cannot repair them, and some cannot find spare parts, so that there is equipment but it cannot increase production. If the government can designate an institution to connect the machinery factories with surplus manpower in various regions, especially some large factories, with the nearby agricultural cooperatives, to help farmers maintain, maintain, and use these equipment, so that it can always exert its due effect. The burden on farmers will be calculated based on the quantity of increased production due to assistance. In this way, the country's surplus technical strength can be used to go to places lacking technology to obtain agricultural production increases. (2) Since these surplus labor forces have been contracted by the state, they can be placed in enterprises for training and improvement, but this economic burden should not be included in the cost of the enterprise, and should be established as a separate expenditure. Because if this is not done, the enterprise's economic accounting work will not be easy to do, the real achievements will not be obvious, and the enthusiasm of the enterprise's management will be affected, resulting in more economic losses.

I hope the government will consider the above two points.

    右派分子的私货在工程技术人员中缺乏市场
    陆景云的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长关于政府工作、中缅边界问题、预决算、经济计划、检察院和法院工作的各项报告。也同意彭副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，及乌兰夫副总理所作关于成立两个自治区的报告。感觉到我们政府的工作，这样又清楚、又有条理的向人民交代，把问题摊开来，指出正确的及错误的思想，主动分析工作中的优缺点，提出改善和努力的方法和方针，是任何其他形式的政府所办不到的。
    在这次会议期间，学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话之后，使我有了明确是非的标准。又在小组讨论和大会发言中，听到大家所揭发的右派分子的阴谋活动，给我很大的启发，提高了我的政治认识水平。
    做事要勇敢积极，只要对人民有贡献，是不会被埋没亏待的
    我是一个工程技术人员，也是一个党外的知识分子。右派分子对知识分子挑拨中的一点，是说：党外知识分子在工作中有职无权。以我亲身的经历来说，却完全不是如此的。由于党和政府信任我，使我能在解放后短短八年中从头至尾的参加和完成了两个新厂的建设工作，这些厂的规模、完备程度和建设速度，是解放前我所不能想像的。在这几年的工作中，虽然不是没有困难和曲折，但我都能放手做事，勇敢的担当责任。在我的工作中，我和厂长是有明确的组织关系和业务分工的，我管技术，他管行政；厂长因事不在时，就把他的职务交我代理，我只觉自己能力不够，不能完全照顾过来。平时在所有的问题中，我都能参加意见；连党委会及党员代表大会我都被邀列席，并且发言。虽然在我现在的工作中保密要求是很高的，但我什么都能知道，这使我感觉自己的责任重大。在我们之间有不同意见时，就提出讨论，甚至争吵一阵，但这并不妨碍我们的关系，大家知道这是工作中不能完全避免的。我对于我所看到的个别不良现象，经常提出尖锐的批评，也能起到督促改善的效果；不但对共事的厂长如此，对上级的领导也是如此，我从没有受到过什么打击。我得出的结论是：做事要勇敢积极，无所顾虑，只要能对人民有真正的贡献，在现在这个社会中是不会埋没人亏待人的。而且，我认为，有职有权不等于可以允许人利用职权来实现他的个人企图。如最近报纸上揭露的，右派分子罗隆基，身为森林工业部长，却不愿意管木头，以为是埋没了他；又想利用部长的职位来实现拉拢私人的企图，拉拢不成，继之以打击。这样的人，不是一个好的知识分子，既不应该有权，也不应该有职。
    谁是我们的朋友，我们应该看谁的榜样？
    右派分子也讲到资本主义好，美国好，等等；就使我回忆到我在美国替伪政府工作时与美国人接触的经验。那时我发现他们所关心的完全是生意经，一旦我在他们的生意眼中没有了价值，他们就会掉头不顾；即是在谈生意经中，还得处处警惕提防以免吃亏。他们也曾说过，我们可以学他们的方法，同样的可以繁荣起来；这话当时曾迷惑过我，使我对他们有过幻想。可是后来我发现，他们社会的繁荣，最初是靠抢夺当地土人得来的，现在是靠经常的贸易出超来维持的，其间又发了几次战争横财。且不说他们战争掠夺手段的恶劣及他们社会内部分配的不合理；就拿他们认为天公地道的贸易出超来说吧，难道世界上每一个国家都可以做到像他们那样年年有出超吗？还剩下有谁来担当这个贸易入超的对手呢？我那时不懂马列主义，却懂得算术的加减法，我想不可能大家都能是加的而没有减的，有人占了便宜必定有人吃亏！我就认出了跟着他们走是走进死胡同，不但走不通，而且要给他们当作牺牲品。既然在经济上跟他们是没有出路，其他如他们所标榜的民主生活和个人自由都是空的，是骗人的。实际上当美国人想到我们中国一旦将真会赶上他们，他们就会惊叫这是可怕的“黄祸”了。
    在目前的工作中，当我与苏联友人接触时，发现他们所关心的，是如何使我们的将来能更好，甚至还鼓励我们要超过他们；他们的态度非常谦虚诚恳，更不说现在我能从苏联专家那里学到的技术，在美国却是看也不让看的。这样就很明显谁是我们的友人，我们应该看谁的榜样。
    能够亲身参加建设热潮，是对于工程技术人员生活上的最大满足
    好像右派分子所提的生活是否降低的问题，是很会打动知识分子的心事，我认为政府对知识分子的照顾是周到的，又加上物价稳定，在企业中有劳保待遇，子女教育费低等等，都是新旧社会之间的不可比项目，是生活的提高，除非是再想过不健康的美国式的淫靡生活的人，就决不会对目前的生活感觉不如以前；我还认为倒是这样才能保持知识分子不走向堕落的生活。何况对我们工程技术人员来说，能够为我们自己国家的国际地位空前提高而自豪，能够看见祖国人民生活的逐渐提高，工业建设的一日千里，能够亲身参加在这个建设热潮中，贡献出自己的力量，即是生活的最大满足。我相信这样的心情，凡曾经在半殖民地的上海这样的城市长期生活过，受过帝国主义者的压迫，看清了帝国主义者和他们的走狗所谓“高等华人”的嘴脸的人们都会有的。这样的满足，若不是共产党的领导是决不会有，也不可能长久保持的。共产党把我们知识分子从帝国主义者和他们的走狗的压迫下解放出来，是和把农民从地主的压迫下解放出来一样的。
    所以我相信右派分子所贩的私货，在工程技术人员中是缺乏市场的，他们以旧政客的行径，打着为知识分子说话的幌子，先是争权，继之以夺利，再后来必定是把帝国主义者引进来，他们自己又当起“高等华人”来，这哪里是我们知识分子所能同意的呢？但是，还是有不少知识分子受了他们的迷惑还是有若干知识分子掉进了泥坑，与右派分子结伙。为此，我们不能不更加警惕，抓紧政治理论学习，提高我们的政治敏感，辨明是非，加强我们的政治坚定性，分清敌我，在工作中主动的与党的组织靠拢，和党的干部保持正常关系，坚决执行党的政策，克尽自己的职守，事事为人民的整体利益着想，老老实实，勤勤恳恳的做好自己的岗位工作，端正向科学进军的态度，带出接替我们的青年，改换自己对不良生活方式的留恋，杜绝资产阶级思想复萌的可能性；只有这样才能更好的为社会主义建设服务，才是知识分子的正确道路。对于目前的右派斗争，更应该热烈的参加进去，直到最后胜利。
    怎样利用机械制造业的剩余劳力？
    在这里我还想提一提对于目前我国机械制造企业中存在着的剩余人力问题的意见。
    （1）由于去年各单位招收了大量人员，而今年计划的生产任务大致仍在去年的水平，所以一般的机械制造厂都有不少剩余的人力；这些人员，若不作适当的利用，则是一笔相当大的浪费。我认为我们的工业企业与农业生产的联系不够密切，两年来由于农业合作化高潮所鼓励，农业合作社中已添置了大批机械农具及抽水机械，这些机械并非都用得很好，有不少地区由于离工业城市较远，农民机械常识较差，有的不会使，有的不会修，有的则找不到配件，以致有了设备却不能增产，假如政府能指定机构，在各地区将有剩余人力的机械工厂，尤其是一些大厂，与就近的农业社联系起来，帮助农民保养、维护、使用这些设备，使能经常发挥其应有效果。对于农民的负担，则以由于帮助而增产的数量来比算，这样可以利用国家剩余的技术力量到技术缺乏的地方去，获得农业上的增产。（2）这些剩余的劳动力，既已由国家包下来了，可以安置在企业内培养提高，但这笔经济负担不宜算在企业的成本内，应另立开支。因为不这样就会使企业的经济核算工作不好做，真正成绩显不出来，反而影响企业经营的积极性，而造成更多的经济损失。
    以上两点希望政府加以考虑。
