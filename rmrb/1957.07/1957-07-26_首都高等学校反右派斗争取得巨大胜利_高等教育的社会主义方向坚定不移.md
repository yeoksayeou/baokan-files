    Capital Universities and Colleges Achieve Great Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    The Socialist Direction of Higher Education is Firmly Established
    (Our Newspaper reports) Up to recently, the anti-Rightist struggle in various universities and colleges in the capital has achieved a great victory. At present, many schools are successively starting summer vacation.

    During the summer vacation, in addition to the general student holiday, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members will continue to study for a period of time. On the eve of the summer vacation, the party committee leaders of eleven universities and colleges, including Tsinghua University, all made preliminary summary reports to the faculty, students, and staff on the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of rectifying and correcting at the same time, each school decided to continue to study some of the correct criticisms and suggestions that have been put forward in various aspects during the summer vacation, and solve the urgent problems that need to be solved.

    Jiang Nanxiang, President and Party Secretary of Tsinghua University, made a report to the faculty, students, and staff. He pointed out that in the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle that began on May 10, the faculty, students, and staff of Tsinghua University initially exposed and criticized the shortcomings and errors of subjectivism, dogmatism, and sectarianism in the school's work, and then repelled the rampant attacks of the Rightists, defended the Party's line and the Party's leadership, and defended the socialist direction of Tsinghua University. Jiang Nanxiang also pointed out that in this movement, some shortcomings in the school's leadership work have also been improved. Due to the implementation of the spirit of rectifying and correcting at the same time, forty-five important issues related to work and life have been dealt with. In the future, the school will continue to study and solve some problems. In the movement, the faculty, students, and staff of Tsinghua University powerfully counterattacked the Rightists, criticized the anti-Communist and anti-socialist remarks of Qian Weichang, Huang Wanli, Meng Zhaoying and others among the teachers, and criticized the fallacies of Feng Guojiang, Ma Qi and others among the students. Within the Party, the anti-Party activities of Yuan Yongxi, a current member of the Party Committee and Assistant to the President, were also exposed. The majority of the faculty, students, and staff have been tested and tempered in the movement. When talking about the initial experience of the anti-Rightist struggle, Jiang Nanxiang emphasized that without victory on the political and ideological fronts, there can be no socialist school education, and there can be no socialist new Tsinghua.

    Gao Yunsheng, President and Party Secretary of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, said in a report to the faculty and students of the Institute that since the rectification started in mid-May, the Rightists Liu Jingfang, Liu Baozhi, and Zhao Xilin in our Institute have vigorously incited the masses to attack the Party. But after their conspiracy was exposed, the vast majority of the faculty, students, and staff immediately joined the anti-Rightist struggle. In the movement, only a few people had unstable positions and followed the Rightists. Gao Yunsheng said that in this struggle, the hidden poisonous sores of the Institute of Iron and Steel Technology were exposed, and in the process of treating the poisonous sores, our antitoxins were also tempered. In drawing a line between ourselves and the Rightists, our political consciousness has been raised, and the combat effectiveness of our team's political struggle has also been improved, and some confused ideas have been clarified.

    Li Enqiu, Vice President and Party Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Institute, said in a report at the general meeting of faculty, students, and staff that in this struggle, everyone received a vivid practical class education, clarified many confused ideas, and strengthened their class stance. Li Enqiu said that the vast majority of our Party members and League members are standing at the forefront of the struggle, but some people lost their positions at the critical moment of the struggle and became prisoners of the Rightists. In addition, some people have Right-leaning sentiments in the struggle, their ideological positions are blurred, they have a feeling of tenderness, and some people have weak immunity to antitoxins and are easily corrupted, all of which are worthy of vigilance.

    Meng Guimin, Acting President and Party Secretary of Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, made a report to the faculty, students, and staff of the Institute on the 24th. He emphasized that the anti-Rightist struggle is a long-term ideological struggle. Although the struggle in the Institute has come to a preliminary end, it must continue to be deepened. He also hoped that students returning home during the summer vacation should actively carry out publicity for the anti-Rightist struggle to help improve the understanding of the anti-Rightist struggle in all sectors of society and raise the awareness of the broad masses of the people.

    Wu Zimu, President and Party Secretary of Beijing Mining Institute, said at the general meeting of faculty, students, and staff that in the movement of the past two months, we not only learned why we should rectify and how to correctly carry out criticism, but we also recognized the faces of the bourgeois Rightists and understood how to fight them. Although the anti-Rightist struggle in our Institute is coming to an end, it will continue to be deepened after the summer vacation.

    At present, students from these universities and colleges in the capital have begun their summer vacation life. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members of these schools are still staying in the school to continue their political study on the anti-Rightist struggle and to rectify the work of the Party and the League. Graduating students are also staying on campus for short-term previews to welcome the unified distribution of the state.

    Many school leaders have pointed out that in the period of socialist revolution, the struggle against the bourgeois Rightists on the political and ideological fronts is a long-term, arduous, and great task. At present, the struggle has come to an end, and after the start of the new semester, the anti-Rightist struggle still needs to be continued.

    Beijing University, Renmin University of China and other schools are still continuing to criticize the Rightists, and will be on vacation successively at the end of this month and the beginning of next month.

    首都高等学校反右派斗争取得巨大胜利
    高等教育的社会主义方向坚定不移
    本报讯　到最近为止，首都各高等学校反右派斗争已经取得巨大的胜利。目前许多学校正陆续开始暑期生活。
    在暑假期间，除一般学生放假外，共产党员和共青团员将继续学习一段时间。在暑期生活的前夕，清华大学等十一所高等学校的党委负责人，都向全校师生员工作了关于整风运动和反右派斗争的初步总结报告。同时，各校并根据边整边改的精神，决定在暑期中继续把各方面已经提出来的一些正确的批评和建议进行研究，解决迫切需要解决的问题。
    清华大学校长兼党委书记蒋南翔向全校师生员工作了报告。他指出，清华大学的师生员工们自5月10日开始的整风运动和反右派斗争中，起初揭发和批判了学校工作中的主观主义、教条主义和宗派主义的缺点和错误，接着又击退了右派分子的猖狂的进攻，保卫了党的路线和党的领导，保卫了清华大学的社会主义的方向。蒋南翔还指出，在这次运动中，学校领导工作中的一些缺点也获得了改进。由于贯彻边整边改的精神，目前已经处理了四十五件有关工作和生活方面的重要问题。今后学校还要继续研究和解决一些问题。在运动中，清华全校师生员工有力地反击了右派分子，在教师中批判了钱伟长、黄万里、孟昭英等人的反共反社会主义的言论，在学生中批判了冯国将、马琦等人的谬论。在党内，也揭发了右派分子。现任党委常委、校长助理袁永熙的反党活动。全校大多数师生员工都在运动中受到了考验和锻炼。蒋南翔在谈到反右派斗争的初步经验时，他强调指出没有政治战线上和思想战线上的胜利，就不可能有社会主义的学校教育，就不可能有社会主义的新清华。
    北京钢铁工业学院院长兼党委书记高芸生在向全院师生做的报告中说，从5月中旬开始整风以来，我院的右派分子刘景芳、刘宝智、赵锡霖大肆煽动群众，向党进攻。但他们的阴谋被揭穿以后，绝大多数师生员工立即投入了反右派的斗争。在运动中只有少数人立场不稳，曾跟着右派跑。高芸生说，在这次斗争中，暴露了钢铁学院潜伏的毒疮，在医治毒疮过程中，也锻炼了我们的抗毒素。在和右派分子划清界限中，提高了我们的政治觉悟，也提高了我们队伍的政治斗争的战斗力，澄清了一些混乱思想。
    外交学院副院长兼党委书记李恩求在全院师生员工大会上报告时说，在这次斗争中，大家都受到了一次生动的实际的阶级教育，澄清了许多糊涂思想，坚定了阶级立场。李恩求说，我们绝大多数的党团员都站在斗争的最前列，但是也有一部分人在斗争的紧要关头丧失了立场，作了右派分子的俘虏，此外也有些人在斗争中有右倾情绪，思想立场模糊，有温情主义，有些人抗毒素免疫力很弱，易受腐蚀，这都是值得警惕的。
    北京邮电学院代理院长兼党委书记孟贵民在24日向全院师生员工做了报告。他强调指出反右派的斗争是长期的思想斗争，目前全院斗争虽然初步告一段落，但还要继续深入。他还希望暑期回家的学生应该积极进行反右派斗争的宣传，以帮助提高社会各界对反右派斗争的认识，提高广大人民的觉悟。
    北京矿业学院院长兼党委书记吴子牧在全院师生员工大会上说，两个多月来的运动，我们不仅学习了为什么要整风和如何正确地开展批评，我们更认识了资产阶级右派分子的面貌，懂得如何同他们作斗争。虽然现在反右派斗争在我院将要告一段落，但在暑期以后还要继续深入开展。
    目前，首都这些高等学校的学生已经开始暑假生活。这些学校的共产党员和青年团员还留在学校里，继续进行关于反右派斗争的政治学习，并进行整顿党和团的工作。毕业班的学生也还留校进行短期预习，迎接国家的统一分配。
    许多学校的负责人都指出：在社会主义革命时期，在政治战线和思想战线上的反对资产阶级右派斗争，是一个长期的艰巨的伟大任务。目前斗争告一段落，在新学期开始后，尚需继续开展反右派斗争。
    北京大学、中国人民大学等学校现仍在继续对右派分子展开批判，在本月底下月初也将陆续放假。
