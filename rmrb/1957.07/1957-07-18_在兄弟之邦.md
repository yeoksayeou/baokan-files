　　Poland's Population Growth Rate Ranks First in Europe
　　Poland's population will reach 35 million by 1970 (the current population of Poland is 28.07 million). This is a prediction made by Polish population experts based on the current population growth rate in Poland.
　　Poland's population growth rate currently ranks first in Europe, with approximately 500,000 new citizens added each year. This is why Poland is now also raising the issue of controlling population growth.
　　In addition, Poland's infant mortality rate is gradually declining. The number of deaths per hundred newborns has fallen from 16 before the war to 8.2 in 1954. At the same time, the average age of residents is relatively increasing. The current average age is 59 for men and 64 for women, while in 1931-1932, it was 48 for men and 51 for women.
　　Soviet Youth Go to the Wilderness to Harvest
　　Large numbers of young people from all over the Soviet Union are continuously arriving in the wilderness. On the 13th of this month, the first group of 2,100 young men and women from the Moscow region arrived in Akmolinsk, where they are preparing to go to the farms and state farms in the New Cherkasy region to help the laborers on the wilderness to harvest. A few days before their arrival, 820 university students from Kazakh State University also came to the wilderness here to work.
　　New Children's Summer Camp in Democratic Korea
　　The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League is building a children's summer camp in the scenic "Bukchang Valley" in Sunan County. The summer camp is backed by Bonghwa Mountain, which has lush pine and elm forests; it faces Jianlong Reservoir, which stores more than ten miles of clear water. Throughout the year, you can hear the singing of various mountain birds here. In the reservoir, you can swim and boat in the summer, and ice skate in the winter.
　　The summer camp has a three-story modern building with dormitories with 300 beds and a dining hall with 200 seats. There is also a club, a stadium, an outdoor library, and a pavilion in the water. In addition to being a resort for children to exercise in the summer, this summer camp can also be used as a sanatorium for teachers and young workers in the winter. (Attached picture)

    波兰人口增殖率占欧洲第一位
    波兰人口到1970年将达到三千五百万（目前波兰人口为二千八百零七万），这是波兰人口问题专家根据目前波兰人口增殖率推测出来的。
    波兰的人口增殖率现在占欧洲第一位，每年约增加五十万新公民，这就是为什么现在波兰也提出控制人口增长问题的原因。
    另外，波兰的婴儿死亡率逐渐下降，在每一百个新生儿童中死亡数从战前的十六降到1954年的八点二。同时，居民平均年龄相对提高，目前的平均年龄男子为五十九岁，女子为六十四岁，而在1931—1932年时，则男子为四十八岁，女子为五十一岁。

    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会，正在风景优美的顺安郡“北仓沟”里建设一个儿童夏令营。这个夏令营背着烽火山，山上有茂盛的松树和榆树林；面临着见龙水库，水库贮满长达十余里的清水。一年四季，在这里都可以听到各种山鸟的歌唱。在水库里，夏天可以游泳、划船，冬天可以滑冰。
    夏令营中有三层楼的现代建筑物，备有三百张床的寝室和二百个座位的食堂，还设有俱乐部、体育场、野外图书室和水中阁。除夏天作为儿童锻炼身心的胜地外，在冬天，这个夏令营还可以作为教师和劳动青年的休养所。（附图片）
