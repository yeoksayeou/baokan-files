Having listened respectfully to Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and the reports on the state's final accounts, budget, and national economic plan by Vice Premiers Li and Bo, I find them logical and I completely agree with them. I am but a mediocre talent, having achieved nothing, and at the age of over eighty, nearing my end, I should have stayed home and hidden my inadequacies, without the need to come on stage and embarrass myself. However, due to my responsibilities and obligations, I cannot refrain from speaking. Therefore, I humbly offer my personal, and perhaps foolish, opinion for consideration. Since 1940, when I served as the Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council, it has been seventeen years. My relationship with the Communists can be described as being as close as water and milk, without any estrangement. In every meeting, I spoke freely and without reservation, and everything was approved, and I never felt that the Communists were "excluding dissidents." I only felt that the united front policy did not differentiate between Party members and non-Party members. They were willing to listen to suggestions that would enrich the country and proposals that would benefit the people. Social elites and democratic figures were all employed according to their abilities, each contributing their strength. Unexpectedly, figures like Zhang, Zhang, and Chu, opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, were hostile to the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their various fallacies are too numerous to mention. They attempted to restore imperialism and the bourgeoisie in the People's Republic of China. They are truly like ignorant children, speaking recklessly, spreading falsehoods to confuse the masses, plotting to stir up trouble. Such tricks should be publicly denounced, and the truth must be pursued and thoroughly clarified, in order to deter the wicked and prevent improper thoughts, serving as a warning to those who come after. The rise and fall of a country depends on the advancement or retreat of the virtuous and the unworthy. I hope those involved in the rectification campaign will conduct a thorough examination, and not let approval or disapproval be based on personal likes or dislikes, and not let personal feelings determine who is used or discarded. If this is done, then the virtuous will advance and the unworthy will retreat. From then on, the country will be better governed and the people will live in peace. The prosperity and strength of the People's Republic of China will surely increase day by day. To extend this idea, only heroes and outstanding individuals (referring to the Communist Party) can adapt to changing times and adjust measures to suit circumstances (referring to carrying out the revolution), while mediocre people praise the past and criticize the present, stubbornly refusing to change (referring to conservatives). They believe that simple agreements can restore order from the chaos of the Qin Dynasty, and war dances can resolve the siege of Pingcheng. I hate these people who play the zither with glued pegs, sticking to old ways and lacking a long-term vision. They can only see what is near, not what is far. I took leave last year to return to my hometown for recuperation. Along the way, the rivers and mountains were beautiful, the vegetation was vibrant, the villages were peaceful, and the people were happy in their work. Upon entering the cities, I saw bustling markets and thriving industries. Hence it is said, "There are no vagrants in the cities." In the countryside, I saw mulberry and hemp fields everywhere, with blue and green stretching to the sky. Hence it is said, "There is no barren land in the countryside." Effective leadership means always being committed to safeguarding this land, and this has been achieved. Chairman Mao pointed out the problem of contradictions among the people, and all sectors of the country are enthusiastically discussing it. Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, each arguing their own point. But truth is not afraid of debate, and the more it is debated, the clearer it becomes; the more it is argued, the truer it becomes. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support it to the end, without any objection. Since China's liberation, all undertakings that should be promoted and reformed have been carried out in order. Looking back at what the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique did ten years ago, they only relied on the dictates of imperialism, oppressed the people, and enslaved the people. Comparing that to now, who is right and who is wrong is clear even to a child. Why are these people so arrogant in distorting the truth? The imperialist countries have long harbored shameless conspiracies, attempting to undermine the unity of socialist countries and weaken the strength of the socialist camp. Little do they know that our unity is as sacred as a divine force and as solid as iron and stone. They are the lowest kind of cold-blooded creatures who cannot adapt to changing times. Their attempt to undermine our unity and weaken our strength is like using soil to block the Yellow River or trying to carry Mount Tai with the strength of a mosquito. Their failure and demise are imminent! When I came to Beijing from northern Shaanxi this time, the people of northern Shaanxi repeatedly entrusted me to state at the meeting: the people of northern Shaanxi have long experienced revolutionary struggles, are good at distinguishing between enemies and friends, resolutely defend the fruits of victory, and smash the conspiracies of right-wing elements, and so on. Those imperialists who live in a drunken dream, when will they wake up? Now, the sound of peace is shaking the world, and the atmosphere of security is filling both China and abroad. Its realization is only a matter of time. Tell the imperialist countries to listen carefully and watch closely.

    对奸人应鸣鼓而攻之
    安文钦的书面发言
    敬聆周总理政府工作报告暨李、薄二副总理国家决算预算、国家经济计划报告，有条有理，完全同意。我本庸才，一事无成，年逾八旬，行将就木，本应闭户藏拙，不必登台献丑，然职责所在，义务所关，有不能已于言者也。聊以一得之愚，申明在案，请嘉纳焉。忆自一九四○年我担任陕甘宁边区参议会副议长以来，今已十七年矣，和共产党人相处，可以说水乳相融，毫无隔阂。每次在会议上，我是知无不言，言无不尽，均蒙通过，从未感到共产党“排斥异己”。只觉得统战政策不分党内党外，愿闻裕国之语，便民之议，社会贤达民主人士皆能量才任用，各尽其力。讵料章、章、储等数人，反对共产党领导，敌视社会主义制度、无产阶级专政，种种谬论，笔难尽述，企图使帝国主义资产阶级在中华人民共和国复辟。真是黄口孺子，信口开河，谰言惑群，其处心积虑，惟恐天下不乱。此等伎俩，应鸣鼓而攻之，务必追究是非，彻底澄清，方足以寒奸人之胆，杜非分之想，以为后来者戒。自来国家盛衰，胥视贤不肖之进退为转移，愿整风者，深加检查，勿以同异为喜怒，喜怒为用舍。如是则贤者进，不肖者退，从此国愈治而民愈安，中华人民共和国之富强，蒸蒸然有日上之势。推而言之，惟英雄豪杰（指共产党）能于世推移，因事制宜（指进行革命），而庸人是古非今，苦不知变（指守旧派），以为结绳之约，能复治乱秦之绪，干戚之舞，可以解平城之围。恨若辈胶柱鼓瑟，墨守故辙，无远大之眼光，但能及寸不能及尺，但能及尺不能及丈，想肺腑中被门闩所蔽耳。我于去年请假回籍休养，沿途所经过的地方，河山吐秀，草木皆春，闾阎安谧，人民乐业。如入城市，第见?闠繁荣，工商辐辏，故曰市无游民，此之谓也。过农村更见桑麻遍野，蓝蔚接天，故曰野无旷土，此之谓也。领导得法，未尝不耿耿于守斯土者，有致之也。毛主席指出人民内部矛盾问题，全国各界正在热烈讨论，百花齐放，百家争鸣，各辩其理，但真理是不怕争辩的，而且越辩越明，越争越真。所以我衷心拥护到底，毫无异意。惟是我中国自解放后，凡应兴应革的事业，莫不次第进行。回溯蒋介石卖国集团十年前之所为，不过仰帝国主义鼻息，压迫人民，奴役人民。以现在比较起来，孰是孰非，虽三尺童蒙亦能明了究竟，何若辈如此狂妄颠倒黑白耶？关于帝国主义国家久蓄无耻的阴谋，企图破坏社会主义国家的团结，削弱社会主义阵营的力量。岂知我们的团结，尊如神圣力量，坚如铁石，彼是古非今不能于世推移的最下等凉血动物分子，欲破坏我团结，削弱我力量，是犹捧土以塞孟津，蚊力以负泰山，其不至于失败和灭亡者几希！我这次由陕北来京，陕北人民再三嘱托着我与会申明：陕北人民久经革命斗争，善于辨明敌我，坚决捍卫胜利果实，粉碎右派分子的阴谋各等语。彼醉生梦死之帝国主义，曷其醒诸，现在和平之声浪震荡于两间，安全之气象充满于中外，其实现时间问题耳。寄语帝国主义国家者，洗耳以听之，拭目以观之，可也。
