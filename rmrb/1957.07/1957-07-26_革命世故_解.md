An Explanation of "Revolutionary Worldliness"
Li Guangdi

After reading Xiao Qian's "Reassured, Tolerant, Personnel Work" (see page 7 of this newspaper, June 1st), I have some thoughts. Now let's talk about the so-called revolutionary worldliness he mentioned.

Xiao Qian said that the manifestation of "revolutionary worldliness" is "being criticized and clearly disagreeing in one's heart, but not arguing back, instead rushing to self-criticize"; and also, it is "keeping a distance from people, making bland and innocuous statements, looking at the market trend before writing, and expressing an attitude towards any call in a parrot-like manner, without having one's own opinion on anything." He said that this is the "state of alert" that "exists between everyone in our revolutionary society (until the climate changed recently)."

This is a terrible picture. Although the author used a sentence "with a strong and healthy political atmosphere" as a foil, he clearly believes that the spiritual outlook of the new society is gloomy and desolate, without any merit; and people are like enemies to each other, on guard against each other. What kind of scene is this? If this is the case, then not only is the vigorous and rapid development of our society in recent years, the universal situation of factories and rural areas striving to put forward rationalization proposals, criticizing leaders, improving management, and improving production is an incredible phenomenon, but also in terms of literary, drama, film, painting, sculpture, dance, music, and other artistic creations, performances, and exhibitions, who has ever seen such a comprehensive and rich development in Chinese history? If our society is really as gloomy and desolate as Xiao Qian said, how can labor enthusiasm be so promoted? How can spiritual life surpass any previous generation in history? How can material construction have such development?

Xiao Qian may want to describe the caution that people show in certain situations as so-called "revolutionary worldliness." But the actual situation here is complicated and must be analyzed. For example, the country has stood up from almost being submerged in the mud, shining brightly, who can not love it? Socialism has enabled our country to leap over thousands of years in eight years, allowing the vast working people to be active on the stage of the country, becoming the masters of China for the first time, with goals, confidence, methods, and meaningful lives for the first time, who can not love it? It is the Communist Party that leads the people to get all this, the Communist Party, who can not love it? For this kind of great love, many people do not want their words and deeds to cause the slightest harm to what they love, and only hope that their words and deeds can make things better; for what they do not understand, they are unwilling to speak carelessly; thinking of the existence of enemies and bad elements, they are unwilling to let their negligence be used by them. These phenomena are the development of our nation's virtues of humility and prudence under new conditions. This is one kind.

There is also another kind, that is, times have changed, one's own ambitions cannot be freely developed, and the bourgeois ideology towards things and people cannot be freely expressed. One's eyes are full of workers and peasants, and one's ears are full of socialism, one is in the midst of the masses, but one's heart is outside of them. So, there comes a set of traditional worldliness of the exploiting classes to deal with the revolutionary era. Usually, one parrots what others say, and waits for an opportunity to express one's own opinions, this is another kind.

These two phenomena certainly cannot include the entire actual situation of the social phenomena. In the earth-shaking social changes, many people, mainly the middle class, cannot fully adapt to the new life and the requirements of the new society in eight years. The old and new are somewhat uncoordinated, reflecting as restraint in performance, this is also a kind.

Xiao Qian's magic is to lump these different kinds of attitudes together.

The first attitude is good. People who live with the first attitude have clear love and hate towards things, people, and themselves, and they are not indifferent to people. They have praise, care, denunciation, and criticism, they do not make bland and innocuous statements, and they do not look at the market trend before writing. There is a great and far-reaching spiritual unity among them. Their goals are the same, and their paths are the same; they are the same in creating a future socialist garden under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the call of the Party is also the red star of their own wishes. Although there are differences in the order of complete understanding and practice, the call of the Party is also their own view that they want to say but cannot express, and they are not afraid of being ridiculed for parroting others.

The second attitude is the attitude of a few people who retain many bourgeois ideas and regard them as treasures. It is difficult for people who live in this society with this attitude. They also have love and hate, but they need to be hidden deeply, so they keep a distance from people. They also have things to scold and things to praise, but in the socialist market, they are not easy to find buyers, so they have to make bland and innocuous statements, look at the market trend before writing, and even parrot "any call," while making reservations internally.

As for the third attitude, it is generally between the above two, which is also an inevitable situation in the process of great social reform. In this situation, people retreat, and also pursue; they miss, and also admire; they hesitate, and also support. In such a complex and intertwined ideological struggle and life experience, generally speaking, people are still moving forward towards the great adjustment of socialism.

If Xiao Qian is a realistic, well-intentioned, and fair observer, it is not difficult for him to see these actual situations in today's society. Since liberation, he has had many opportunities to see the profound changes in the face of the country. He has lived in rural areas, visited factories, towns, and grasslands, and contacted people from all classes and strata. Can it be said that in the past eight years, all he has seen and heard are so-called "revolutionary worldliness," such as indifference, blandness, parroting, and rushing to self-criticize regardless of right and wrong?

In fact, some of the specific phenomena that Xiao Qian has criticized are worth studying in themselves. Take the example of rushing to self-criticize that he mentioned. The customer blames the clothes for being scorched, and "throws a hat" at the shop assistant. The shop assistant immediately self-criticizes for scorching the clothes. Of course, the laundry shop should compensate the customer for the loss, but there is nothing wrong with taking the initiative to self-criticize. Why is that shop assistant considered to be putting on a show of "revolutionary worldliness"? Does it mean that one must deny one's mistakes and scold back by seizing the "throwing hat" to be considered not worldly?

For example, the problem of parroting others. There is no such thing in the world that one cannot echo what others have said. The question is not whether one can echo and support a call, but whether this call is where the great truth lies and whether it is what the masses want. If this is not the case, but it is unreasonable and violates the trend of popular sentiment, then even if a small group of henchmen are driven by guns and money to be cheerleaders, that kind of call will still fail. Not only will it not resonate with the broad masses of people, but it will arouse greater resistance. The Kuomintang reactionary rule has repeatedly called for anti-communism, but as a result, it was driven into the sea by the Communist Party and the people. If it is where the truth lies and what the people want, this kind of call will inevitably not only arouse profound and widespread resonance, but also turn into an overwhelming mass action. Taking the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce more than a year ago as an example, even if anyone was annoyed or disgusted by the situation of gongs and drums, firecrackers and continuous sounds, it was impossible to stop it. Because the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is precisely the people's own view and their own demand. Moreover, the great socialist revolution was successfully completed without shedding a drop of blood, and of course, it cannot but arouse the unanimous praise of writers, artists, musicians, and so on. Where exactly did Xiao Qian see that the wholehearted support expressed by the broad masses of people and countless intellectuals for the call of the Communist Party is "revolutionary worldliness," is empty parroting, and is not their own view? What does he think their proper view should be? Of course, in the past calls, there were also people who hid their own views and parrot-like expressed their attitude. They do this with their bad intentions, but these bad intentions cannot be hidden for long.

Originally, the manifestation of unity (parroting) and independent thinking are not absolutely opposed things, but two sides of a unity. However, Xiao Qian, in his theory of "revolutionary worldliness," puts these two things in opposition, as if there is now only mindless parroting, and individual style, individual views, and independent thinking have been eliminated, which is no different from "beasts." This kind of erasing conclusion is untenable no matter what. Since liberation, many people have written many things. Some people write vividly, and some people's original style has changed; this is not necessarily bad; some people lack style and are bland and weak; some people do not write at all. There are many reasons for this. If these situations are all said to be the elimination of personal style and personal views, then many writers will not be convinced. Moreover, how can the emergence of many kinds of operas and many new actors with unique styles be explained? Similar situations exist in other literary and art departments and in the entire social life. Taking Xiao Qian as an example, Xiao Qian wrote articles for several years after liberation. Who eliminated his personal style and personal views?

The problem of independent thinking and personal style is of course not just a literary problem. May I ask Xiao Qian, should the personal style of bourgeois rogue careerists like Zhang Bojun be eliminated? Should the personal views and propositions of Luo Longji, who was bought by the United States for a profit, be eliminated? Would the elimination of such personal style and independent thinking turn people into beasts? Everyone should think independently, but independent thinking is not an abstract and isolated concept. Some people use the conscience of the proletariat and the working people to think independently, and some people use the black heart of the bourgeoisie to think independently. In the final analysis, thoughts have their types and their class essence. When some people think based on the propositions and practices of the British Labour Party, are they independent? We advocate that the people should think with the conscience of the proletariat and the working people. This kind of thinking is not enough now, and it is not universal. Therefore, on the one hand, the Communist Party vigorously calls for independent thinking, and on the other hand, it also opposes "independent" thinking with the black heart of the bourgeoisie, wanting to paint our spiritual world in a dark picture. For such "independent" thinking, I don't think the Party leadership will be "reassured," and the people will not agree. The Communist Party will never do things that the people do not agree to, so even if someone opposes it, it will be in vain.

    “革命世故”解
    李光迪
    读了萧乾的“放心·容忍·人事工作”（见本报6月1日第七版）之后，我很有一些感想。现在就他所说的革命世故谈谈吧。
    萧乾说“革命世故”的表现是“挨了批评明明心里不服，不还嘴，反而抢先检讨”；还有，就是“对人不即不离，发言不痛不痒，下笔先看行情，什么号召都人云亦云地表示一下态度，可对什么也没有个自己的看法”。他说这就是“我们这个革命的社会（直到最近气候改变以前）”“大家相互之间存在着”的“戒备状态”。
    这是一幅可怕的图画。虽然作者欲抑先扬，也用了一句“有浓厚的健康的政治空气”作陪，但是他显然认为，新社会的精神面貌灰暗阴沉，一无是处；人与人相互之间如临大敌，互相戒备。这是一种什么景象呢？假如真是这样的话，那么不但几年来我们社会上蓬蓬勃勃的飞跃发展，工厂农村里争提合理化建议，批评领导，改进管理，提高生产的普遍情况是一种不可思议的现象，就拿文学、戏剧、电影、绘画、雕刻、舞蹈、音乐等文艺创作上演和展览方面来说，又有什么人曾经在中国历史上看到这样全面的丰富的发展呢？如果我国社会真是像萧乾所说的那样灰暗阴沉，劳动积极性如何能这样发扬？精神生活如何能这样超越历史上任何一代？物质建设如何能有这样的发展？
    萧乾或者想把人们在某些情况下所表现的谨慎说成是所谓“革命世故”。但是这里的实际情况是复杂的，必须加以分析。譬如说吧，国家从几乎灭顶的泥浆中站起来了，光辉灿烂，谁能不爱它？社会主义使我国的八年跨过了过去的几千年，使广大劳动人民活跃在国家的舞台上，第一次做了中国的主人，第一次有目标、有信心、有办法、生活有意义，谁能不爱它？领导人民得到这一切的是共产党，共产党，谁能不爱它？为了这种大爱，很多人不愿自己的一言一动对所爱的东西有丝毫伤害，唯愿自己的一言一动都能把事情作得更好；对于自己所不了解的，不愿意信口开河；想到敌人和坏分子的存在，不愿意让自己的疏忽被他们所利用。这些现象，乃是我们民族谦虚谨慎的美德在新条件下的发展。这是一种。
    还有一种，那就是时移势易，自己的野心不得自由发挥，对事对人的资产阶级思想不得自由表现，满目工农大众，满耳社会主义，身在群众之中，心为化外之人。于是就来了一套对付革命时代的剥削阶级的传统世故，平常人云亦云，伺机发挥一通，这又是一种。
    这两种现象当然不能包括社会现象的全部实际情况。在掀天覆地的社会变革中，许多人，主要是中间阶层，不能在八年岁月之中就完全适应新的生活和新社会的要求。新旧有所不调，反映为表现上的拘束，这也是一种。
    萧乾的魔术就是要把这几种性质不同的态度混为一谈。
    第一种态度是好的。抱着第一种态度生活的人们对事对人对己爱憎分明，对人并不是不即不离。他们有歌颂、有关切、有口诛、有笔伐，不是发言不痛不痒，下笔先看行情。在他们中间有伟大的、深远的精神上的一致性。他们的目标相同，道路相同；同于在共产党领导下创造将来的社会主义花园。因此，党的号召也就是他们自己的愿望的红星。尽管在完全理解和身体力行方面，有先后多少之不同，但是党的号召也就是他们自己心欲言而口不逮的自己的看法，不怕人讥笑说是什么人云亦云。
    第二种态度是保留了许许多多资产阶级思想而又视为至宝的少数人所有的态度。本着这种态度生活在这个社会里的人可就难了。他们也有爱憎，但是需要深藏起来，于是就对人不即不离。他们也有所要骂，有所要捧，但是在社会主义的市场里，他们却不容易找到买主，于是只好发言不痛不痒，下笔先看行情，甚至对“什么号召”也要人云亦云，而内作保留。
    至于第三种态度大体上介乎上述两者之间，这也是社会大改革的过程中不可避免的情况。在这种情况中，人们有所退缩，也有所追求；有所留恋，也有所倾慕；有所犹豫，也有所拥护。在这样复杂交错的思想斗争和生活锻炼中，一般地说，人们还是在向社会主义的伟大的调整前进。
    如果萧乾是一个实事求是的善意和公正的观察者，他对于今天社会的这些实际情况是不难看到的。解放以来他有不少机会看到全国面貌的深刻变化，他住过农村，到过工厂、城镇和草原，他接触了各阶级各阶层的人。难道说八年之中，他的所见所闻都是所谓“革命世故”，都是不即不离、不疼不痒、人云亦云、不问是非抢先检讨之类吗？
    实际上，萧乾所指摘的一些具体现象其本身就值得研究。就拿他所讲的抢先检讨的事例来说吧。客人怪衣服烫糊了，向店员“飞帽子”，店员为衣服烫糊了马上检讨。当然，这个洗衣铺应该赔偿客人的损失，但是主动检讨这件事并没有什么不对。为什么那个店员就算是摆“革命世故”？难道一定要犯了错误反而矢口否认，抓住“飞帽子”来大骂一通，才算是不世故么？
    再譬如人云亦云的问题吧。世间本来就无所谓只要人云了自己就不能云的事。问题完全不在于有了号召能不能人云亦云地加以支持和拥护，而在于这种号召是否大道理之所在，是否众心之所归。假如不是这样，而是没有道理，是违反人心的趋向，那么，即使靠着枪杆子和金钱驱使一小撮狐群狗党做了啦啦队，那种号召也还是落空，不但不能在广大人民中得到共鸣，反而激起更大的反抗。国民党反动统治曾经无数次号召反共，结果反而被共产党和人民赶下了海。假如是真理所在，是人心所向，这种号召就必然不但要引起深刻广泛的共鸣，而且要变成排山倒海的群众行动。以一年多以前的资本主义工商业社会主义改造来说，那种敲锣打鼓、鞭炮连天的情况，即使有任何人听着心烦，看着讨厌，要想加以阻止也是势所不能。因为资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正是群众自己的看法，自己的要求。而且伟大的社会主义革命没有流一滴血就顺利完成，当然也不能不激起作家、美术家、音乐家等等的交口颂扬。萧乾究竟从什么地方看出广大人民和无数知识分子对于共产党的号召所表示的万众一心的支持是“革命世故”，是空洞的人云亦云，不是他们自己的看法呢？他认为他们应有的看法是什么呢？当然在历次的号召中，也是有人把自己的看法藏起来而人云亦云地表示一下态度的。他们这样做有他们的坏打算，这种坏打算却藏不了多久。
    本来万众一心的表现（人云亦云）同独立思考不是绝对对立的东西，而是一个统一体的两面。但是萧乾在他的“革命世故”论中却把这两个东西对立起来，好像是现在只有毫无头脑的人云亦云，而消灭了个人风格、个人看法，消灭了独立思考，这就无以“异于禽兽”。这种抹煞一切的论断无论如何是站不住脚的。解放后许多人写了许多东西。有的人写得生龙活虎、有的人原有的风格改变了；这不一定是坏；有的人缺少风格，平淡无力；有的人根本没有写。这有许多原因。如果把这些情况统统说成是个人风格和个人看法被消灭了，那么，很多作家就不能心服。而且，许多剧种和许多有独特作风的新演员的出现又将作何解？类此情况，在其他文学艺术部门和整个社会生活中还有许多。即以萧乾为例，解放后萧乾写了几年的文章。什么人把他的个人风格、个人看法消灭了呢？
    独立思考和个人风格的问题当然都不仅是文艺问题。试问萧乾，像章伯钧那种资产阶级流氓野心家的个人风格应不应该消灭呢？像罗隆基那种美国买下民盟还有赚头的个人看法和主张应不应该消灭呢？难道消灭了这样的个人风格，独立思考，也会变成禽兽么？人人都应该独立思考，但是独立思考不是一个抽象的孤立的概念。有人凭着无产阶级和劳动人民的良心来独立思考，有人凭着资产阶级的黑心来独立思考。归根到底，思想都有它的类型，有它的阶级本质。当有的人根据英国工党的主张和作法来思考的时候，难道他是独立的吗？我们主张人民应该凭着无产阶级和劳动人民的良心来思考，这种思考现在还不够，还不是普遍的，因此共产党一方面大力号召独立思考，另一方面也反对凭着资产阶级的黑心来“独立”思考，想把我们的精神世界涂得一片漆黑。对于这样的“独立”思考，我看不但党的领导不会“放心”，人民也不会答应。共产党决不做人民不答应的事，所以尽管有人反对也是枉然。
