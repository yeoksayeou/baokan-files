    The road we traveled was lined with mulberry trees. The fields and hills were as neatly arranged as gardens after a gardener's pruning, some like green ribbons, others like green carpets. These were the autumn wheat sown by farmers during the October events of last year, now grown into strong seedlings. Rows of brown fertilizer were evenly piled on the newly cultivated yellow soil, on which new fruit saplings were planted. New fruit trees were also interspersed in the existing vineyards. According to reports, 30 million new fruit trees have been planted nationwide this year, twice as many as last year.

    On the way to Tangretz Village, we also saw some people playing football in the rain, while others watched the game with umbrellas. It turned out that these young people were all members of the Petofi Production Cooperative. The cooperative has more than eighty young people, so the cultural and recreational life in the cooperative is very active.

    I asked them, are there any young people who are individual farmers in the village? Do they participate in collective activities? One young man replied that all the organizations in the cooperative lacked contact with individual farmers. The young people of individual farmers once asked to join our football team, but we refused. After the events of last October, eighteen relatively wealthy middle-peasant households withdrew from the cooperative. Now that they see the cooperative has a future, they want to come back, but they are shy and hesitant. Another young man interjected, saying that some people in our cooperative are committing the error of isolationism. For example, at one general meeting, it was decided that we would simply no longer accept new members. The Party has reviewed and criticized this decision. As they were talking, the person in charge arrived.

    He first told me some of the characteristics of this cooperative:

    The Petofi Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in 1949. It now has 145 households, 245 members, and a total of 1,500 holds of land (approximately 13,000 Chinese mu). This land mainly belonged to a landlord in this village. Most of the members were also laborers on this landlord's estate. There are very few rich peasant households (in the past, rich peasants owned 20% of the land nationwide). This club used to be the residence of a rich peasant. This rich peasant used to have eighty holds of land (720 mu). I asked where this rich peasant is now? At that time, he was left with two holds of land (less than what was distributed to poor peasants), but he didn't want it and went elsewhere to do small business.

    He also talked about the very bad influence of Nagy's right-leaning agricultural policy in 1953 on this village. At that time, individual farmers said to the farmers in the cooperative, "Your cooperative has no future, we will not join the cooperative." Rich peasants spread rumors among the peasants, saying, "The sun is shining on us again, our time has come, we want to take back the ancestral land!" At that time, the middle peasants also wanted to grow wings, climb to the position of rich peasants, and support Nagy's policy. Only the poor peasants and farm laborers resolutely defended the cooperative.

    After the events of last October, only eighteen households withdrew from the cooperative. They took away 220 holds of land, all of whom were middle peasants with more land. They were deceived and didn't know what the future of the cooperative would be. They thought it was more reliable to keep the land in their own hands than to leave it in the cooperative. Now that they see the government is still strongly supporting the cooperative, they are beginning to waver, wanting to come back but hesitant. The cooperative still lacks contact with them and has not provided them with assistance and education.

    What kind of work does this production cooperative engage in?

    Their work includes corn, wheat, barley, potatoes, vegetables, poultry, livestock, etc. Among them, corn and wheat are high-yield crops. In an average year, corn can yield 12 quintals per hold (approximately 8.5 Chinese mu) (1,200 kilograms), and the highest yield was 48 quintals.

    The horses they raise are famous racehorses nationwide. They can run 25 kilometers per hour, and even faster with training. They now have sixty fine horses.

    Their pigs are the best in the state, and Dolna State's pigs are famous throughout the country. Piglets can grow to 20 to 25 kilograms (40 to 50 catties) in eight weeks. Fat pigs average 300 kilograms, and four- to five-year-old sows weigh 500 kilograms. They now have fifty sows. Last year, they exported 150 fat pigs to Czechoslovakia.

    Because of good production, the lives of the members have greatly improved.

    In the past, most of them were penniless laborers, part of the so-called three million beggars. Before liberation, three or four families lived together in one small house. Now, each household has its own independent house and yard. Last year, one workday earned 31 forints in cash and in kind. A member can generally work 300 workdays, and some can work as many as 600 workdays (livestock team). For example, one family with three laborers worked a total of 1,000 workdays last year, earning 17,000 forints in cash and 13,000 forints in kind (equivalent to more than 5,000 yuan). Last year, one family spent 50,000 forints to buy a house.

    Now the cooperative has an average of one motorcycle for every two people and one bicycle for each person. Generally, their income exceeds that of individual farmers.

    This year's spring planting was completed earlier than in previous years. Due to favorable weather conditions: the winter was not very cold, and spring came early. Due to the abolition of the requisition system and various restrictions, the farmers' enthusiasm for labor is very high. This year, fertilization was timely and the amount was increased. Cultivation is more meticulous. The number of small machines and farm implements purchased has also increased. The cooperative sold two trucks this year and bought two small tractors. The cooperative now has five small tractors and does not need the state-owned tractor station to cultivate the land. The person in charge of the cooperative explained that in the past, the tractor station charged too much, which made the farmers feel it was not worthwhile, but this year the fees have been reduced. In addition, investment in orchards and animal husbandry has also increased.

    So far, the cooperative's sowing situation is much better than that of individual farmers. This year, the income will not be lower than that of individual middle peasants. If there are no natural disasters this year, a bumper harvest can be achieved. The cooperative plans to increase each workday to 35 forints this year.

    After this trip and visit to the countryside and production cooperatives, several questions remain in my mind. These are also questions that Hungary is currently researching and discussing and need to be resolved.

    The first question is how to control the purchase price of agricultural products.

    With the abolition of the requisition system and the reduction of land tax per unit area and fees charged by tractor stations, it is certain that the farmers’ enthusiasm for production has generally increased. However, the state must purchase a large amount of agricultural products from farmers. If the purchase price in the free market is not reduced and controlled, it will cause a general rise in prices. This is a problem that must be studied and resolved before the autumn harvest. The comrades of the Petofi Cooperative said that they will help the state control the prices of individual farmers in the free market in this regard. However, non-socialist agricultural products account for the vast majority, and how to control their prices is a relatively complex and difficult issue.

    The second question is the issue of middle peasants and collectivization.

    The lives of middle peasants in the Hungarian countryside are very prosperous. This is a natural obstacle to collectivization. To some extent, some new measures to develop productivity in agriculture this year are also conducive to consolidating the position of individual middle peasants. The basic issue of socialist transformation in the Hungarian countryside is how to attract middle peasants to participate in collectivization. The rich peasant class was eliminated during the First Five-Year Plan. The rich peasants were originally a powerful class, occupying 20% of the cultivated land. Later, some changed careers, and most have been reduced to the level of middle peasants (the standard for classifying farmers in Hungary: those with three to five holds are poor peasants, those with more than seven holds are middle peasants, and the general maximum amount of land held is no more than twenty to twenty-five holds).

    The vast majority of the rural population are middle peasants, and the vast majority of middle peasants are individual farmers. Calculated by cultivated area: before the October events, the cultivated land of collectivized and state-owned farms accounted for 33%, now it accounts for about 26%, of which cooperatives account for 13%, that is, non-socialist agriculture still accounts for 74%.

    In the 13% of collectivized agriculture, before the October events, middle peasant members accounted for 20%-25%, now they account for about 10%-17%.

    Generally, individual middle peasants have more land on average than cooperative members, and their production base is also better. The Petofi Production Cooperative is a well-run large cooperative. The income of the members exceeds the level of individual middle peasants. However, the productivity of many cooperatives cannot keep up with the level of middle peasants, because they are mainly organized by poor peasants and farm laborers who lack means of production. Therefore, the income of the members of some cooperatives is not as good as that of individual farmers. The middle peasants are afraid of suffering losses and are unwilling to join the cooperatives. Therefore, some people have proposed forming cooperatives with middle peasants and middle peasants.

    Therefore, to attract middle peasants to join cooperatives, it is first necessary to strengthen the superiority of collectivization. How to strengthen the superiority of collectivization? First, it is necessary to increase state investment in agriculture and increase the production of mechanization and artificial fertilizers. Because in the past, the superiority of cooperatives was not prominent in the comparison between small machine cultivation and horse cultivation.

    Second, the leadership and organization of collectivization need to be strengthened. After the October events, the unified cooperative charter was abandoned. Some cooperatives have no charter at all, and some cooperatives freely revise it, adding some unreasonable provisions. In the past, the leadership method was too strict and rigid. Now it is too loose, and there is a phenomenon of abandoning leadership in some aspects. Regarding the issue of state agricultural machinery stations: whether state tractor stations are needed and whether cooperatives can buy large tractors is still a matter of debate.

    Third, it is necessary to promote transitional forms of lower-level collectivized organizations, such as temporary and permanent mutual aid teams, and the joint ventures of production industries. This issue was raised last year, but not enough attention was paid to it. No matter how their production base is, individual farmers all share the problems of lacking labor and worrying too much. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is practical and necessary to adopt gradual transitions for individual middle peasants, starting with mutual aid forms and gradually leading them to the path of collectivization.

    裴多菲生产合作社
    ——匈牙利多尔娜州访问记之五——
    本报记者  胡济邦
    我们经过的道路，两旁全是桑树。田野和山坡像经过园丁修剪后的花园那样整齐，有的像绿色的缎带，有的像绿色的地毡，这都是去年十月事件期间农民播下的秋麦，现在已长成茁壮的青苗。在刚刚耕耘过的黄色土地上均匀地堆积着一行行的棕色肥料，上面种植着新的果苗。在原有的葡萄田里也间种着新的果树。据报上公布，今年全国新植果树已达三千万棵，比去年多两倍。
    来到唐格列茨村的途中，我们还看到一些人在雨天踢足球，另有一些人带着雨伞看球赛。原来这些青年都是裴多菲生产合作社的社员，这个社共有八十多个青年，因此社里的文娱生活非常活跃。
    我问他们，村里有单干户的青年吗？他们是否参加集体活动？一位青年回答说，社里的一切组织和单干户都缺少联系。单干户的青年曾要求加入我们的足球队，我们没有答应。去年事件发生后，社里有十八户比较富裕的中农退出去了。现在看到我们的社有前途，又想回来，但又害羞，心里在摇摆。另一青年插嘴说，我们社里有些人犯着关门的偏向，如有一次大会上作了这样的决定：干脆不再吸收社员了。党对这个决定已作了检查和批评。谈到这里负责人来了。
    他首先告诉我这个社的一些特点：
    裴多菲农业生产合作社是1949年成立的，现在有一百四十五户，二百四十五个社员，共有一千五百霍尔特土地（约合一万三千市亩）。这些土地主要是过去本村一个地主的土地。社员大多数也是这个地主庄园上的雇工。富农户数很少（全国过去曾有20％的土地属于富农）。这个俱乐部就是过去一家富农的住宅。这个富农曾有八十霍尔特土地（七百二十亩）。我问现在这个富农那里去了？当时留给他二霍尔特地（比分给贫农的地还少些），他不要，就到别的地方去做小买卖去了。
    他又谈到1953年纳吉的右倾农业政策对这个村子的很坏影响。当时单干户对社里的农民说：“你们合作社没有发展前途，我们不进社。”富农在农民中间散播谣言说：“太阳又向我们照耀，我们的时候来到了，我们要收回祖传的土地！”当时中农也想长羽毛，爬上富农的地位，拥护纳吉政策。只有贫雇农是坚决维护合作社的。
    去年十月事件发生后，退社的只有十八户，他们带去二百二十霍尔特土地，都是土地较多的中农，生产工具和牲口则折价退款。他们是受了欺骗，不知道合作社的前途如何，以为把土地先拿在自己手上比放在社里可靠些。现在看到政府还是极力支持合作社，他们开始动摇，想回来又有顾虑。社里对他们还缺少联系，没有对他们进行帮助和教育。
    这个生产合作社从事些什么作业呢？
    他们的作业有玉米、小麦、大麦、土豆、蔬菜、家禽、家畜等等，其中玉米、小麦都是高产作物。玉米中等年成，每霍尔特（约合八·五市亩）可收到十二公担（一千二百公斤），最高收过四十八公担。
    他们养的马是全国有名的赛马，每小时可跑二十五公里，如果经过训练还可快些。现在养着六十匹骏马。
    他们的猪是本州最好的，而多尔娜州的猪又是全国著名的。小猪八个星期可以长到二十到二十五公斤（合四十到五十市斤），肥猪平均达三百公斤，四到五年的母猪重有五百公斤。现在他们有五十只母猪。去年出口一百五十只肥猪，运往捷克斯洛伐克去。
    由于生产好，所以社员的生活大大提高了。
    过去他们大多数都是一无所有的雇工，也就是所谓三百万乞丐中的一部分。解放前三、四户人家合住一间小屋。现在，则每户都有独门独院。去年一个劳动日分到三十一福林的现款和实物。一个社员一般可以做到三百个劳动日，有的可以多至六百个劳动日（畜牧队）。如有一户农民共有三个劳动力，去年共做一千个劳动日，分到现款一万七千福林和一万三千福林的实物（相当五千多人民币）。去年就有一家花了五万福林买了一所房子。
    现在社里平均每二人有一辆摩托车，每人有一辆自行车。一般都超过单干户的收入。
    今年春播工作比往年完成早。由于天时条件顺利：冬天不很冷，春天来得早，由于征购制和各种限制的取消，农民的劳动情绪非常高涨。今年施肥及时，量也增加了。耕耘更加细致。购买小型机器和农具的数量也增加了。社里今年卖去两辆卡车，买进两架小型拖拉机，现社里共有五架小型拖拉机，可以不要国营拖拉机站代耕了。该社负责人解释说，过去拖拉机站收费太贵，使农民感到很不合算，但今年已将收费额降低。此外，在果园、牧畜业方面的投资也有增加。
    至目前为止，该社的播种情况比单干农民要好得多。今年收入不会比单干中农低。今年如不发生天灾，即可达到丰收。该社今年的每个劳动日计划提高到三十五福林。
    在我这次旅行和参观农村和生产合作社之后，在脑子里留下几个问题，这也是匈牙利目前正在研究讨论须待解决的问题。
    第一个问题是如何控制农产品的采购价格。
    征购制取消，单位面积的土地税和拖拉机站的收费也都降低了，肯定的一个问题是激起农民生产情绪的普遍提高。但国家则须向农民进行大量采购，如不降低和控制自由市场的采购价格，将会引起一般物价的上涨。这是必须在秋收以前研究解决的问题。裴多菲合作社的同志说，他们将在这方面帮助国家控制个体农民在自由市场的价格。但非社会主义的农产品商品是占着绝大部分，如何控制其价格是一个比较复杂而困难的问题。
    第二个问题是中农和合作化的问题。
    匈牙利农村中的中农生活是很富裕的。这对合作化是一个自然的阻力。今年农业中的一些发展生产力的新措施在某种程度上也有利于个体中农地位的巩固。匈牙利农村中的社会主义改造问题基本上是如何吸引中农参加合作化的问题。富农阶级在第一个五年计划期间已被消灭。富农原为一个强大的阶级，占有耕地20％。后来一部分转业，大部分已降为中农的水平（匈牙利划分农民的标准：占有三到五霍尔特的为贫农，占有七个霍尔特以上的为中农，一般占有土地最多不得超过二十到二十五霍尔特）。
    农村中绝大多数是中农，中农中的绝大多数是单干户。如以耕地面积计算：合作化和国营农场的耕地在十月事件前占33％，现在约占26％，其中合作社占13％，即非社会主义的农业尚占74％。
    在13％的合作化的农业中，在十月事件前中农社员占20％—25％，现在约占10％—17％。
    一般单干中农的土地比合作社社员平均的土地要多些，生产基础也比较好些。裴多菲生产合作社是一个办得好的大社。社员收入超过单干中农的水平。但有许多社的生产力还赶不上中农水平，因为它们主要是由缺乏生产工具的贫雇农组织起来的，因此有些社的社员收入不及单干户。中农就怕吃亏不愿入社，因而曾有人提出中农和中农组社。
    因此，要吸引中农加入合作社，首先需要加强合作化的优越性。如何加强合作化的优越性呢？第一，需要增加国家对农业的投资，提高机械化和人造肥料的生产。因为过去在小型机器耕和马耕的对比之下尚显不出合作社的突出优越性。
    第二，对合作化的领导和组织工作也正待加强。十月事件后，统一社章已被抛弃，有的社根本没有社章，有的社自由修订，加进一些不合理的规定。过去领导方法失之过严，过死。现在又嫌过松，有某些放弃领导的现象。关于国家农业机器站的问题：要不要国家拖拉机站，合作社可不可以买大型拖拉机，这仍是目前一个争论的问题。
    第三，需要提倡采取过渡形式的低级合作化组织，如临时和常年的互助组，以及生产行业的联合。去年已提出这个问题，但还不够注意。单干户不论它生产基础怎样，劳动力缺和操心多，这是他们共同存在的问题。因此，一般认为对单干中农，采取逐步过渡，从互助形式开始逐渐引上合作化的道路，是切实可行的，也是很需要的。（附图片）
