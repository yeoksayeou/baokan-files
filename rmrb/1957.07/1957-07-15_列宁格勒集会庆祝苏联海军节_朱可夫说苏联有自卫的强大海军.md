Xinhua News Agency, July 14th — According to a TASS report: A rally was held in Leningrad on the 13th to celebrate Soviet Navy Day.

After the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Admiral Gorshkov, declared the opening of the conference, the Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal Zhukov, delivered a speech.

Zhukov said that we now have a powerful navy that is fully capable of defending the entire coastline and national interests of our great motherland. Our navy has first-class equipment and brave naval warriors who are familiar with and love their profession. Like all the soldiers of the Soviet armed forces, they are infinitely loyal to their people and are always ready to respond to the call of the Party and the government and stand up to defend our motherland.

Speaking of the fact that the Soviet people are successfully carrying out the tasks set by the 20th Party Congress, Zhukov said that the political and labor achievements of the Soviet people eloquently prove the correctness of the general line of our Party, which is supported and unanimously endorsed by the entire Soviet people. He emphasized that the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov attempted to usurp the leadership of the Party and deviate from the Leninist line determined by the 20th Congress, embarking on a path that was not in the best interests of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. He said that the Party's Leninist Central Committee, supported by the entire Party and the entire people, unanimously condemned the activities of the anti-Party group.

Representatives from all walks of life in Leningrad also spoke at the meeting, expressing their warm respect to the soldiers defending Soviet territorial waters.

Also attending the celebration meeting were foreign naval and military delegations who came to Leningrad to celebrate Soviet Navy Day.

On the 14th, Zhukov issued an order celebrating Soviet Navy Day.

    列宁格勒集会庆祝苏联海军节
    朱可夫说苏联有自卫的强大海军
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社报道：列宁格勒13日举行了庆祝苏联海军节大会。
    大会由苏联海军总司令戈尔什科夫海军上将宣布开幕后，苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅讲了话。
    朱可夫说，现在我们有着完全能够保卫我们伟大祖国的全部海岸线和国家利益的强大海军。我们的海军有着头等的装备，有着熟悉而且热爱自己事业的勇敢的海军战士。他们像苏联武装部队所有的战士一样，无限忠诚于自己的人民，时刻准备响应党和政府的号召，挺身保卫我们的祖国。
    朱可夫在谈到苏联人民正在顺利地执行第二十次党代表大会所规定的任务时说，苏联人民的政治和劳动成就雄辩地证明了全体苏联人民所拥护和一致支持的我们党的总路线的正确性。他强调指出，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫和谢皮洛夫反党集团企图篡夺党的领导权，使党离开第二十次代表大会所决定的列宁路线，而走上不符合苏联和整个社会主义阵营切身利益的道路上去。他说，受到全党和全体人民支持的党的列宁主义的中央委员会一致地斥责了反党集团的活动。
    在会上讲话的还有列宁格勒市的各界代表，他们向保卫苏联领海的战士致以热情的敬意。
    出席庆祝大会的还有因庆祝苏联海军节而来到列宁格勒的外国海军和军事代表团的人员。
