    Two Judgments
    The inscription at the entrance of the U.S. Supreme Court reads: "Equal Justice Under Law." A recent report in "Time" magazine provides the best illustration of the falsity of this statement.

    According to the magazine, in a certain city in Texas, a white man named Ross shot and killed a Black teenager in a cafe, and wounded two Black girls. The court and a white jury considered the murderer "not guilty of premeditated murder," sentenced him to five years' imprisonment, suspended the sentence, and released him on the spot. But in Birmingham, Alabama, a Black man named Hanselton was accused of theft and "attempted rape" of an elderly white woman. Although the defendant proved his innocence, he was sentenced to death by electric chair.

    两种判决
    美国最高法院进口处刻有这样一句话：“在法律面前一律平等”。美国“时代”周刊上新近刊载一段报道，为这句话的虚伪性提供了最好的说明。
    据这家杂志说，得克萨斯州某一个市，白人罗斯在咖啡馆枪杀了一个黑人少年，枪伤两个黑人少女。法院和白人陪审团认为凶手“并非蓄意杀人”，将他判刑五年，缓期执行，当场释放。但是在阿拉巴马州伯明罕市，黑人汉寨尔顿被控盗窃和“企图强奸”一个白人老妇，虽然被告证明自己无辜，但却被判电椅处死。
