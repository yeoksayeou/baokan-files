Nanjing Xinhua Daily News: Nantong Medical College, in the anti-Rightist struggle, thoroughly exposed the ugly face of Rightist Professor Wu Xianghua.

    Mao Zuyu, a physician at the affiliated hospital, revealed that in 1952, Wu Xianghua taught him how to criticize the Communist Party, saying, "When you criticize the Communist Party, say 'you group of Party members.' When others hear it, they'll think I'm just criticizing some Party members, not the entire Party, so they won't be able to catch you with a counter-Party pigtail." During the ideological remolding, Wu Xianghua also taught him how to sell capitalist private goods while cloaked in Marxism-Leninism. Wu Xianghua said, "When you speak, say 'Marx said this, Lenin said that.' This will make those Party members scramble to look up the books, and they won't even be able to refute you."

    In 1952, there was a disabled veteran patient with a nasal odor. Wu Xianghua insisted that it was related to a shrapnel fragment in his lung, even though the fragment could have been left in place. When the veteran wanted to transfer to another hospital for surgery, Wu Xianghua said, "Let him transfer, let him suffer the pain of surgery!" This is how Wu Xianghua treated the lives of the working people! Mao Zuyu also said that Wu Xianghua either talked nonsense or cursed everything while lecturing. He didn't wash his hands before surgery and smoked during surgery. When others were busy at work, he would chat. Qian Minghui, Wang Tongguan, and two others revealed that one night, a tetanus patient needed a tracheotomy. Dean Zheng Bai personally went to call him, but he intentionally ignored him. Later, he ran to the ward and emphasized that there was no consultation request, refusing to perform the surgery. After repeated pleading, he reluctantly agreed, but the patient died due to the delay. They also revealed that once, a female tetanus patient came, and Wu Xianghua went to the internal medicine department, saying she should be seen by surgery. Then he went to surgery, saying they should consult the internal medicine director. When the internal medicine and surgery directors came together, he said that the patient's tetanus was caused by an abortion and should be seen by obstetrics and gynecology. Wu Xianghua once said, "When seeing a patient, you must first learn to pass the buck," and he used such words to educate young people!

    Nurse Gu Nianzu revealed that this Rightist, cloaked in the guise of a professor, also used his position to insult female patients. On May 18th of this year, there was a female patient in the affiliated hospital with an ear problem, but Wu Xianghua said she needed a full-body examination. On May 24th, he again used the pretext of performing a full-body examination on a female patient to achieve his goal of insulting women, even though the patient did not need a full-body examination at all. Such things have happened ten times this year. Gu Nianzu said angrily, "How can such a person educate students? Does he deserve the honorable title of professor?"

    Wu Xianghua not only provoked relationships between superiors and subordinates, and between colleagues, but also provoked relationships between medical staff and patients. Mao Zuyu revealed that he said, "During the rank evaluation, he once told the leaders that a certain doctor could only be placed at rank ten. After the evaluated ranks were announced, he told that doctor, 'You should have been placed at rank nine, why are you at rank ten? Make a fuss with the leaders!'" Wu Xianghua also once encouraged a patient to beat the dean, saying that making a fuss would get him medicine. Professor Qian Minghui also revealed that Wu Xianghua tried to transfer all the active elements he disliked out of the ENT department and transferred the backward elements he was satisfied with in, turning the ENT department into his own kingdom.

    Wu Xianghua is a member of the preparatory committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Nantong City and a member of the China Democratic League. When he joined the Democratic League, he made three agreements with the person in charge of the Nantong City Democratic League: 1. No membership dues; 2. No attending meetings; 3. Only attend meetings if there are sweets and refreshments. He also negotiated with another Rightist, Zhang Xiubin, on the same terms, joined the Peasants' and Workers' Party, and was appreciated by Zhang Xiubin and recommended as a member of the municipal preparatory committee. He came from a landlord family. In 1932, he graduated from the Medical College of Peking University. In 1940, he acted subserviently and, through the connections of the big traitor Tang Erhe, was sent to Japan to study by the Japanese Nagai Sen and Yamaki. In name, he was sent by the school, but in reality, he was one of a group of pro-Japanese lackeys purposefully cultivated by the Japanese puppet "Greater Asia Institute." At that time, when Japanese imperialism was trampling on the motherland, he was favored by his masters because of his loyalty to the Japanese invaders, and he had even met the Emperor. After Japan surrendered, he transformed again and became a Kuomintang receiving official, taking over Shijiazhuang Hospital, and later taking over Changxindian Railway Hospital and serving as its director. The whistleblowers said, "He truly deserves to be a triple character of landlord, traitor, and bureaucrat!"

### 南通医学院揭露吴祥骅人面兽心

    南通医学院揭露吴祥骅人面兽心
    本报讯　南京新华日报消息：南通医学院在反右派斗争中，彻底揭露了右派分子教授吴祥骅的丑恶面貌。
    附属医院医师茅祖裕揭露：1952年时，吴祥骅曾经教他如何骂共产党，他说：“你骂共产党时就说你们这班党员，别人说起来，我是骂的一些党员，不是骂的整个党，因此人家就抓不到你反党的小辫子。”在思想改造时，吴祥骅又教他如何披着马列主义的外衣来贩卖资本主义的私货。吴祥骅说：“你说起话来，就说马克思这样说的，列宁这样讲的，这样弄得这般党员翻书也来不及，而且还不能反驳。”
    1952年时，有个荣军病员，有鼻臭，吴祥骅硬说这和他肺部的一个弹片有关，其实这个弹片是可以不取出的。当这位荣军要转院开刀时，吴祥骅说：“让他转院，让他去吃吃开刀的苦头！”吴祥骅就是这样对待劳动人民的生命的！茅祖裕还说：吴祥骅授课时不是胡说八道，就是骂东骂西，动手术前不洗手，动手术时还抽烟；上班时别人在忙，他却聊天。钱铭辉、王同观等四人揭发：有一天晚上，一个破伤风病人需行气管切开，郑白院长亲自去喊他，他有意不理睬，后来跑到病房又强调没有会诊单，不肯动手术，再三恳商，才勉强答应，但终于因时间延误，未行手术，病员已死了。他们又揭发：有一次来了一个破伤风的女病员，吴祥骅跑到内科说应该外科看。又跑到外科说应该请内科主任会诊。内外科主任一起来时，他又说病人是打胎引起的破伤风，该由妇产科来看。吴祥骅曾经说：“看病要先学会踢皮球”，并且用这种话来教育青年人！
    护士顾念祖揭发：这个披着教授外衣的右派分子，还借着自己的职权去侮辱女病员。在今年5月18日，附属医院有个女病员，是耳朵有毛病，吴祥骅却说要作全身检查。5月24日，他又假借为一个女病员作全身检查，达到他侮辱女性的目的，其实这个女病员根本不需要作全身检查。像这样的事情，今年以来已经有十次。顾念祖愤愤地说：“像这样的人还能教育学生吗？还对得起教授这个光荣的称号吗？”
    吴祥骅不仅挑拨上下、左右之间的关系，而且还挑拨医务人员和病员之间的关系。茅祖裕揭露他说：“在评级时，他曾对领导说某医师只能放在十级，等评定的级别公布后，他又对那个医师说‘你应该放在九级的，为什么是十级？向领导上闹！’”吴祥骅还曾经鼓动一个病员去打院长，说闹闹就有药了。钱铭辉教授还揭发吴祥骅把自己不称心的积极分子都设法调出耳鼻喉科，而把他所满意的落后分子调进去，使耳鼻喉科变成他的天下。
    吴祥骅是农工民主党南通市筹委委员、民盟盟员。他在参加民主同盟时和民盟南通市负责人约法三章：一、不缴盟费；二、不参加会；三、开会有糖果点心就去。他也以同样条件和另一右派分子张秀彬谈判，参加了农工，并被张秀彬赏识而推荐为市筹委委员。他是地主家庭出身，1932年毕业于北京大学医学院，1940年奴颜屈膝，通过大汉奸汤尔和的关系，由日本人永井潜和山奇介绍去日本留学，名义上是学校派去的，实质上是当时日伪‘兴亚馆’有目的培养的一批亲日派奴才。当时正是日本帝国主义蹂躏祖国之时，而他却由于他忠实于日寇得宠于主子，为此曾经谒见过天皇。日本投降后，他又摇身一变，成为国民党接收大员接收石家庄医院，后来接收长辛店铁路医院并任院长。揭发者说：“他真不愧是个地主、汉奸、官僚三位一体的人物！”
