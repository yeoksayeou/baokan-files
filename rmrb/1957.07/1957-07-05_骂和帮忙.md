　　Scolding and Helping
　　Lí Píng
　　At the Second Symposium of Journalists, Zheng Baitao proposed the idea that "socialist newspapers can also engage in minor scolding for major assistance."

　　What does scolding mean? In his essay "Killing with Scolding and Killing with Praise," Mr. Lu Xun interpreted the word "scolding" as attack. It is like the vicious language used by the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang reactionaries to insult our people and socialism. This is something even a child understands within the realm of common sense. Who does Zheng Baitao advocate for scolding in socialist newspapers? Obviously, it is not the enemies of socialism, not American imperialism, not the Chiang Kai-shek gang reactionaries, but the socialist system, the Communist Party, and the People's Government. Advocating scolding the socialist system itself, scolding the leaders of socialism, isn't it obvious who is scolding whom?

　　Zheng Baitao said that minor scolding is for major assistance. Who is being helped? Look: The vicious words of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, Luo Longji, and their ilk, attacking socialism, didn't they greatly assist the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang reactionaries, thus earning their cheers?

　　Why did he make such a proposition? Originally, his views "can also be said to be somewhat the same as Chu Anping's." Originally, he "liked to watch and was willing to watch" the voices and complaints published in Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily that scolded the people's democratic dictatorship, socialism, Marxism-Leninism, and the Communist Party.

　　From ancient times to the present, who among thieves has ever admitted that his stealing behavior is theft? It's just that different standpoints lead to different viewpoints.

    骂和帮忙
  　黎平
    在第二次新闻工作者座谈会上，郑白涛提出主张“社会主义的报纸也可以小骂大帮忙”。
    骂是什么意思呢？鲁迅先生在“骂杀与捧杀”一文中，曾把骂字作攻击解。正如美帝和蒋帮反动派运用恶毒语言，对我国人民，对社会主义进行辱骂者然。这是任何一个小孩也懂得的常识以内的事。郑白涛主张在社会主义报纸上骂谁呢？显然不是社会主义的敌人，不是美帝国主义，不是蒋帮反动派，而是社会主义制度，是共产党，是人民政府。主张骂社会主义制度本身，骂社会主义的领导者，这究竟是谁在骂谁，不是很明显吗？
    郑白涛说，小骂是为了大帮忙。帮了谁的忙呢？请看：章伯钧、储安平、葛佩琦、罗隆基之流，攻击社会主义的恶言，不正是对美帝与蒋帮反动派帮了大忙因而博得他们的喝彩之声么？
    他为什么要作如此主张呢？原来他的意见“也可以说同储安平有某些一样”。原来他就“喜欢看、愿意看”光明日报和文汇报登载的那些骂人民民主专政、骂社会主义、骂马列主义、骂共产党的声音和牢骚。
    从古至今，做贼的人，谁又承认他的偷窃行为是贼呢？立场不同，看法也就不同罢了。
