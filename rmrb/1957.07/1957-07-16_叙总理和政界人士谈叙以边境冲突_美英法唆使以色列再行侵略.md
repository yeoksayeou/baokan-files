Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 15th: According to reports in "Al-Nour" and "Al-Barada" on July 14th, Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali, regarding the Syrian-Israeli border conflict, stated: "We have warned more than once that we will repel any aggression against us with a powerful counterattack."

Al-Assali added: "We will not be isolated on the battlefield, because the people of all free countries in the world who hate the evil aggression against Egypt and face the threat of aggressors will stand by our side."

"Al-Barada" reported that Jabri, the chairman of the National Front parliamentary group and chairman of the Syrian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, pointed out: "Israel's acts of aggression stem from the plans of US, British, and French imperialism."

The Secretary-General of the People's Party, Dawalibi, said: "The Arabs must confront the United States with a firm stance. It must end Israel's aggression, or we must treat it as a hostile force."

The recent series of clashes on the Syrian-Israeli border has drawn serious attention from the Arab world. The Cairo newspaper "Al-Shaab," in exposing the imperialist conspiracy behind this series of events recently, pointed out that the purpose of the United States moving Israeli troops to the Syrian border is to divert the attention of the Syrian army and its headquarters from domestic events, forcing the Syrian army to gather near the border in order to facilitate the conspirators' attempt to overthrow the current government. The newspaper also pointed out that the imperialist conspiracy to infringe upon the freedom and independence of the Syrian Republic consists of three parts. The first part is: conspirators from the Muslim Brotherhood and the pro-fascist Syrian Social Nationalist Party colluding with reactionary forces in Syria to prepare the groundwork for a coup. The second part of the conspiracy is: "The US Ambassador and military attaché in Damascus are responsible for leading the smuggling of weapons into Syria." The third part of the conspiracy is to organize a government that serves US policy.

    叙总理和政界人士谈叙以边境冲突
    美英法唆使以色列再行侵略
    据新华社大马士革15日电　据“光明报”和“巴拉达报”7月14日报道，叙利亚总理阿萨利就叙利亚—以色列边境冲突事件发表谈话说：“我们曾经不止一次提出警告说，我们将用强有力的回击来击退对我们的侵略。”
    阿萨利又说：“在战场上我们不会是孤立无援的，因为憎恨对埃及发动罪恶侵略并且面临着侵略者的威胁的自由世界各国人民，将站在我们这一边。”
    “巴拉达报”报道，民族阵线议会党团主席、叙利亚议会外交委员会主席加贝里指出：“以色列的侵略行动是从美、英、法帝国主义计划中产生的。”
    人民党总书记达瓦利比说：“阿拉伯人必须用坚定的立场来对付美国。它必须结束以色列的侵略，否则我们就必须以敌对立场对待它。”
    最近在叙利亚和以色列边境接连发生的冲突事件，引起了阿拉伯世界的严重注意。开罗“人民报”最近在揭露这一系列事件背后的帝国主义阴谋时指出，美国要以色列军队向叙利亚边境移动的目的，是要转移叙利亚军队和它的司令部对本国事件的注意力，迫使叙利亚军队集结在国境附近，以便于阴谋者实现他们推翻现政府的企图。这家报纸还指出，帝国主义侵犯叙利亚共和国的自由和独立的阴谋是由三部分组成的。第一部分是：穆斯林兄弟会和亲法西斯的叙利亚国家社会党的阴谋分子同叙利亚的反动势力串通一气，给政变准备基础。阴谋的第二部分是：“由美国驻大马士革的大使和武官负责领导向叙利亚偷运武器。”阴谋的第三部分是组织为美国政策服务的政府。
