    I would like to offer some suggestions regarding our nation's silk production. Raw silk is a crucial export commodity for our country, generating a substantial amount of foreign exchange each year. From 1931 to 1948, the Chinese silk industry suffered greatly due to the global economic recession, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and years of civil war. The export volume of raw silk and silk fabrics plummeted from over 210,000 piculs to below 40,000 piculs. After liberation, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the government, the central authorities vigorously promoted the development of the silk industry. Various provinces either opened up new silkworm rearing areas or urged the revival of the industry, implementing considerable measures, leading to a visible increase in raw silk exports. However, observing the past two years, the increase in production in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces has stagnated. It is estimated that in 1957, cocoon production in Jiangsu will be 200,000 piculs, in Zhejiang 550,000 piculs, and in Sichuan 210,000 piculs, significantly lower than in 1956. Since these three provinces are the key silk-producing regions of China, their reduced production means a reduction in national output. This will have a serious impact on international trade and the silk manufacturing industry. The reasons for this differ among the three provinces. Taking Jiangsu and Zhejiang as examples, the following points are noteworthy:

    1. Farmers believe that cocoon prices have been too low since 1931, making sericulture unprofitable, and they are unwilling to invest in mulberry fields. Conversely, intercropping within mulberry fields is unrestricted, leading to a decline in the unit yield of mulberry fields year after year. On average, throughout Jiangsu province, less than one silkworm egg sheet can be reared per mu of mulberry field. The lower the unit yield of mulberry fields, the lower the profit, and naturally, sericulture gradually decreases.

    2. During the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and grain production increase, due to water conservancy, transportation, and other considerations, mulberry fields were extensively dug up everywhere, reducing the original mulberry field area.

    3. In terms of production and management, cooperatives have limited experience in the importance of diversified operations and do not pay enough attention to sericulture as a sideline. Amidst the fervor of digging up mulberry trees, there are no new management methods to maintain the industry.

    Given this situation, the Chinese silk industry is fundamentally a cause for concern, and efforts must be made to rectify it. Within the existing sericulture areas, without hindering grain production, we must strive to increase production. During our inspections, we observed Zheng Bokui's mulberry cultivation and management in Wuxi, Jiangsu, where each mu of mulberry field yielded 3.6 silkworm egg sheets throughout the year. If everyone could achieve this, production could increase by 2.6 times. We would be satisfied even if we only increased the unit yield of mulberry fields by one time, thereby doubling cocoon production. However, to achieve increased production, corresponding measures are necessary. I would like to propose the following points for consideration:

    1. Strengthen the central leadership structure: Establish a permanent silk management organization composed of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and other relevant agencies, serving as the highest authority for handling matters related to the development of the silk industry.

    2. Increase cocoon prices: Farmers commonly say that the current price of one picul of fresh cocoons is equivalent to only slightly more than four dan of polished rice, which is too low compared to the past. It is suggested that cocoon prices be appropriately increased within the realm of possibility. Furthermore, gradually promote the method of farmers drying their own cocoons, using dried cocoon evaluation to ensure accurate cocoon prices. This also allows farmers to earn wages for drying cocoons, indirectly increasing cocoon prices and boosting their interest in sericulture.

    3. Train a group of high-level mulberry cultivation technicians and hold cooperative sericulture management training courses for existing sericulture cadres and cooperative committee members to strengthen the staffing of sericulture cadres.

    4. Promote the cultivation of large-sized grafted seedlings: The cultivation of mulberry seedlings should be given the same importance as the cultivation of silkworm eggs. In addition to the urgent need to cultivate quick-growing mulberry seedlings, regular seedling cultivation is essential to produce large-sized grafted seedlings to meet the demands of silkworm farmers. These seedlings, when planted in mulberry fields, can immediately serve as the main trunk. Developing the main trunk within the mulberry field is less economical and effective than developing it in a nursery.

    5. Change the policy of factory site selection: Silk factories in Jiangsu have traditionally been highly concentrated, initially in Shanghai and recently in Wuxi. In contrast, factories in Zhejiang and Sichuan are dispersed in various locations. In the future, Jiangsu factories should be located in cocoon-producing areas, which would reduce transportation costs, preserve the traditional rustic atmosphere, and benefit labor allocation. Especially locating factories in raw material areas, with year-round activity, can boost the enthusiasm of silkworm farmers.

    I submit these preliminary opinions for the representatives' correction and guidance.

    采取适当措施　发展蚕丝生产
    郑辟疆的发言
    我现在就祖国蚕丝生产提出一些意见。生丝为我国重要输出品，每年换取外汇，为数至巨，自一九三一年至一九四八年间，一再受世界经济不景气和抗日战争，以及连年内战等关系，使中国蚕丝业大为衰落，生丝绸缎的出口量，由二十一万余市担降至四万市担以下，解放后，由于党和政府之领导，中央作了大力发展蚕丝业之号召，各省或辟蚕桑新区，或督促复兴，均有相当措施，生丝出口，显见增加。但由最近两年观之，苏、浙、川三省，增产停滞，估计一九五七年产茧江苏有二十万担，浙江有五十五万担，四川有二十一万担，比一九五六年下降甚多，因苏、浙、川三省为中国产丝重点区域，故三省减产，即是全国减产。这于国际贸易上和制丝工业上，将受到严重的影响。其原因所在，三省不同，就江浙言之，有如下几点：
    一、农民认为一九三一年以来，茧价太低，育蚕利薄，不愿投资于桑田，相反的，桑田内之间作，漫无限制，以致桑田之单位产量逐年下降，江苏全省平均，一亩桑田养不到一张蚕种，桑田单位产量愈少，利益愈薄，养蚕自亦渐少。
    二、农业合作化和粮食增产之高潮中，因水利交通等关系，成片的掘桑，所在皆有，原有桑田面积，因之而缩小。
    三、合作社生产经营上，对多角经营之重要性，经验尚少，对蚕桑副业，不够重视，在掘桑热潮中，自无新经营方法可以维持。
    依此情况，中国蚕丝业在根本上，大为可虑，不可不用力整顿，在原有蚕桑区域，无妨于粮食生产之范围内，必须使之增产。我们在视察中，见江苏无锡郑伯逵之栽桑经营，每一亩桑田，全年育蚕达三点六张蚕种，假使都能如此，就能增产二点六倍，我们但求桑田单位产量增加一倍，使产茧增产一倍，亦已满足，但欲求增产，必须有相当之措施，方可获得成果，特提出以下几点，以供采择：
    一、加强中央领导机构：由农业部、纺织工业部、对外贸易部及其他有关机关，组成经常性的蚕丝管理机构，为处理蚕丝业发展事宜之最高机关。
    二、提高茧价：农民咸称现在一市担鲜茧，等于四石余白米，比较过去，实在太低。建议在茧价上，在可能范围内，酌量提高；另外逐步推行产茧自烘办法，以干茧评价，使获得正确的茧价，同时可使获得烘茧之工资，此亦间接提高茧价之一端，足以增加蚕农之养蚕兴趣。
    三、培养高级栽桑技术人才一班，并对现有之蚕桑干部及合作社委员，举行合作社蚕桑经营训练班，以加强蚕桑干部之配备。
    四、培养大型接苗，按培养桑苗，应与培养蚕种同一重视，除急切需要培养速成桑苗外，必须正规的育苗，育成大型接苗以适应蚕农要求，使栽入桑田，就作主干，若在桑田内养成主干，实不如在苗圃内养成主干的经济而有效。
    五、改变设厂地点之方针：江苏丝厂，素极集中，最初在上海，近年集中于无锡，浙江、四川，均分散于各处，今后江苏设厂，应在产茧区域，既可减少运输成本，又可保持朴素之风，对劳力分配，也有好处，尤其在原料区设厂，终年活动，足以提高蚕农之积极性。
    所陈浅见，是否有当，请各位代表指正。
