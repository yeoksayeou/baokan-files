    Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - TASS reported: According to A. Kuznetsov, Deputy Minister of Transport Construction of the Soviet Union, by 1960, the total length of Soviet electrified railways will be three times that of the United States.
    A. Kuznetsov recently published an article in "Pravda" saying that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union will convert 8,100 kilometers of railways to electric locomotives. In the past fifteen years, nearly 40,000 kilometers of railways have been electrified. He said that electric locomotives are economical in all aspects and very fast, reaching 150 kilometers per hour. It takes ordinary locomotives ten days and nights to travel from Moscow to Vladivostok, while electric locomotives only take six days and nights.
    He also said that during this Five-Year Plan period, 6,500 kilometers of new lines will be built. After many new lines are completed, the distance of the original lines can be greatly shortened. For example, the original line from Stalinsk to Abakan is 700 kilometers long, but after the new line is completed, the distance can be shortened by two-thirds. Every kilometer shortened can save the country hundreds or even thousands of rubles.

    苏联电气化铁路正迅速发展
    三年后总长度为美国的三倍
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联运输建设部副部长阿·库兹涅佐夫说，到1960年，苏联电气化铁路的总长度将为美国的三倍。
    阿·库兹涅佐夫最近在“真理报”发表文章说，在第六个五年计划期间，苏联将有八千一百公里的铁路改用电气机车行驶。在最近十五年内，将近有四万公里的铁路要电气化。他说，电气机车在各方面都经济，而且速度很快，每小时达一百五十公里。从莫斯科到海参崴普通机车要行驶十昼夜，而电气机车只需要六昼夜。
    他又说，在这个五年计划期间，还要建设六千五百公里的新线路。许多新线路建成后，将可以大大缩短原线路的距离。例如，从斯大林斯克到阿巴根的原线路长七百公里，而新线路建成后，距离可以缩短三分之二。而每缩短一公里就能给国家节省几百甚至几千卢布。
