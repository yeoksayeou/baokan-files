Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 11th: The acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Mr. Winiewicz, received the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Hamilton, and the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. de Dadelszen, on July 10th, and handed them two memoranda regarding the situation in Korea.

The memoranda stated that the decision of the United Nations Command to transport new weapons to South Korea is incompatible with Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and also drew attention to the fact that since June 21, 1957, the United Nations Command has not submitted reports on the replenishment of military supplies and aircraft to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC).

Regarding this point, the government of the People's Republic of Poland believes that it would be beneficial if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea expressed its concern about the equipping of South Korean military forces with new weapons. The Polish government believes that the commission should demand a halt to these plans, as doing so can only complicate the situation in Korea. Furthermore, these plans run counter to the existing trend of reconciliation in international relations and the achievement of understanding on disarmament issues. The memoranda concluded by emphasizing that the Polish government is prepared to continue making its own contributions to achieving the goal set by the Armistice Agreement for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission—the peaceful reunification of Korea based on democratic principles. Considering that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should continue its activities, the Polish government hopes that, for the sake of peace, it will continue to fulfill all the responsibilities stipulated by the Armistice Agreement for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, in cooperation with other member states of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission—Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden.

    波兰要求瑞典瑞士根据中监会职责
    共同制止美国破坏朝鲜停战协定
    新华社11 日讯　据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰外交部代理部长维尼维奇7月10日接见了瑞典代办汉密尔顿和瑞士代办德达德耳，把两份有关朝鲜局势的备忘录交给了他们。
    备忘录说，联合国军司令部决定把新式武器运到南朝鲜去的决定是和朝鲜停战协定第十三款不相容的，并且还引起人们注意这一事实：自从1957年6月21日以来，联合国军司令部就没有向中立国监察委员会送交关于补充军火和飞机的报告。
    关于这一点，波兰人民共和国政府认为，如果朝鲜的中立国监察委员会对于用新式武器来装备南朝鲜军事部队一事表示不安，那会是有益的。波兰政府认为，委员会应该要求停止实行这些计划，因为这样做只能使朝鲜的局势复杂化。此外，这些计划是同国际关系趋于和解和在裁军问题方面趋于达成谅解的现有趋势背道而驰的。备忘录最后强调说，波兰政府准备继续为达到停战协定给中立国监察委员会规定的目标——根据民主的原则获致朝鲜的和平统一——作出自己的贡献。由于认为中立国监察委员会应该继续进行活动，波兰政府希望，为了和平，在同中立国监察委员会的其他委员国——捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士和瑞典合作下，继续执行停战协定给中立国监察委员会规定的一切职责。
