    Good Cadres in the Flood Control Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Zhengzhang

    During the recent mountain floods in parts of Anhui Province, many good cadres emerged who fought bravely against the floods, some of whom heroically sacrificed themselves while rescuing victims.

    On the evening of the 9th, the water level of the Nanfei River rose sharply by five meters, and the levee of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hefei City was breached by a seven-zhang (approximately 23 meters) wide gap by the raging flood. The sacks and soil blocks that were used to block the breach were washed away by the waves. Seeing that the lives and property of the people within the levee were about to be swallowed by the flood, Xia Yesheng, the general branch secretary of the township, and Qu Linyun, the branch secretary of the cooperative, used sacks and their bodies to block the flood at this critical moment. People nearby saw this and jumped into the water one after another, forming a "human dike" and blocking the flood. Kong Xianzhang, Minister of Politics and Law of the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Huo Xiucheng, Deputy Secretary of the Suburban District Committee, personally led the members in rescue efforts on the levee, working tirelessly for a whole day and night without eating. After the flood peak subsided, the members were very excited and believed that it was a result of the good leadership of the Communist Party cadres that such a large flood did not breach the levee. Li Dama, a sixty-four-year-old member, said: "Today the world has changed, and people have changed too. Secretaries and ministers help the people in rescuing and repairing dikes, which has never been seen before." In Nanling County, from the county head to the township head, all showed a noble character of selflessly safeguarding the interests of the people during flood prevention and rescue. When the Xialindu levee in this county was in danger and seepage was discovered on the inner slope of the levee, Deputy County Head Fan packed boxes on the outer slope to protect the levee together with the workers, and guarded the levee for two days and nights. The workers were very moved and actively protected the levee, which resulted in averting the danger. Hu Zhenfa, the fifty-year-old deputy township head of Dongtang Township, risked his life to plug a leak and was washed away by the flood, but was fortunately rescued by the workers. The people of the entire township expressed their great gratitude for his spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Some cadres defending the Qingyi River levee in Nanling County endured hunger and cold in the water, driving piles and rushing to rescue. They put forward the slogan "In order to protect the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people, I will die in the water," which moved many elderly people who said: Such good cadres have never been seen since ancient times. When the Eight-Faced Buddha embankment at the lower reach of Xiqiao Town in Xuancheng County collapsed, the town party secretary was the first to jump into the rolling water to rescue it, driving more than five hundred people to go into the water to rescue it together. When they protected the embankment, Tao Yuefa, a seventy-year-old man, said: "In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the water was much smaller than this, but three or four hundred people drowned. This year the flood is even bigger than that year, but the levee has not been breached and no one has died. We really want to thank the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for sending good cadres."

    When some villages were surrounded by floods, the people's cadres showed even more noble qualities of self-sacrifice to save others. The masses in Sunbu District of Xuancheng County are all spreading the story of how Liang Zhanyuan, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, and Gao Shaozhang, a cadre, bravely rescued a family of five farmers trapped by the flood. In the Tongjinhu area of ​​Hanting Township, floods submerged more than 20 villages. In this extremely critical situation, Dai Shaocai, the township party secretary, and Tang Jin, the township head, personally braved the danger and led more than 20 township and cooperative cadres, and after a day and night of rescue, transferred all 104 peasant households to safe areas. When mountain floods broke out in Liuan County on the 8th, a dozen villages in Dinghua Second Cooperative of Dingji Township were surrounded by floods. Zhu Qitang, the captain of the Pishugang Production Team, tied doors together to make rafts and went into the water to rescue the members. In the struggle with the turbulent flood, the bamboo poles were knocked off by the ferocious waves, and the raft was broken up. He honorably sacrificed himself. Afterwards, the members shed tears of grief in front of his tomb and said: "Captain Zhu worked very well when he was alive, and he died for the people."

    防汛斗争中的好干部
    新华社记者  石正章
    安徽省部分地区在最近发生山洪暴发中，出现了很多奋不顾身地同洪水搏斗的好干部，有的已在抢救灾民中光荣牺牲。
    9日晚上，南淝河水位陡涨五公尺，合肥市郊区东方红农业社圩堤被汹涌的洪水冲出了一个七丈多长的缺口，堵塞进去的麻袋、土块，被水浪冲击得无影无踪。乡总支书记夏叶圣和社分支书记瞿林云眼看圩内人民的生命财产就要被洪水吞没。在这千钧一发的时候，他俩便用麻袋和身体挡住洪水。旁边的人看到，也一个接一个跳下水去，结成了一道“人堤”，堵住了洪水。中共合肥市委政法部长孔宪章、郊区区委副书记霍修成亲自在圩堤上领导社员抢险，整整干了一天一夜没有吃饭。洪峰降落后，社员们都很激动，认为像这样大的洪水不破圩，真是共产党的干部领导的好结果。六十四岁的老社员李大妈说：“今天世道变了，人也变了。书记、部长帮助老百姓抢险修堤，这是从来没有见过的事。”在南陵县，上自县长，下到乡长，在防洪抢险中都表现了维护人民利益奋不顾身的高贵品质。这个县的范副县长在下林都圩告急时，圩的内坡又发现渗漏现象，范副县长就和民工一起在外坡打包厢护堤，并在圩堤上防守了两昼夜。民工们很受感动，也积极护堤抢险，结果挽救了险象。东塘乡五十多岁的副乡长胡振发舍身堵漏洞，被洪水冲走，幸被民工救起。全乡人民对他这种忠心耿耿为人民服务的精神表示非常感激。防守南陵县青弋江大堤的一些干部在水里忍饥耐寒，打桩抢险，他们提出了“为了保护几十万人民的生命财产，我是死也死在水里”的口号，感动得很多老年人都说：从古以来也没有看到过这种好干部。宣城县西河镇下首的八面佛堤埂塌陷时，镇党委书记第一个跳下波浪翻滚的水中抢救，带动了五百多人下水一齐抢险。当他们保住了堤埂时，一位七十多岁的老人陶月发说：“民国二十年，水比这要小得多，可是淹死了三四百人，今年洪水比那年都大，反而没有破圩，没有死人，真要感谢共产党领导和毛主席派来了好干部。”
    当一些村庄被洪水包围时，人民干部更表现了舍己救人的高尚品质。宣城县孙埠区群众中都传颂着区委副书记梁占元和干事高少章在洪水中奋勇抢救出一家五口被洪水围困的农民的事迹。寒亭乡通津湖一带，洪水淹没了二十多个村庄，在这极度危急的情况下，乡党委书记戴绍才和乡长唐晋都亲自冒着危险，带领二十多个乡社干部，经过一天一夜的抢救，把一百零四户农民全部转移到了安全地带。六安县在8日山洪暴发时，丁集乡丁华二社有十几个村庄被洪水围困，皮树岗生产队队长朱启堂为了抢救社员，把门板扎成筏子下水前去抢救，在和洪水激流搏斗中，被凶浪打掉了竹篙，冲散了筏子，光荣牺牲。事后，社员们在他的墓前流着沉痛的眼泪说：“朱队长活着时工作很好，死也是为着人民。”
