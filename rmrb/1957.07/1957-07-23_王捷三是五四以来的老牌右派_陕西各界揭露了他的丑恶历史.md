    Wang Jiesan is a Veteran Rightist Since the May Fourth Movement: All Circles in Shaanxi Expose His Ugly History
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, July 22nd) From June 12th to early July, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) held an expanded meeting, and the Xi'an Normal College held dozens of discussion meetings, criticizing Wang Jiesan's reactionary speeches and exposing his past consistent anti-communist and anti-people ugly history. At the same time, workers, citizens, and the masses in Wang Jiesan's hometown of Hancheng also wrote letters to criticize and expose his reactionary speeches and past reactionary crimes.
    Professor Gao Yuanbai of the Chinese Department of Xi'an Normal College used the academic achievements of the Party and League members in the Chinese Department to illustrate Wang Jiesan's slander against Party and League members. Wang Jiesan completely fabricated slanders against Party and League members, saying that the Party and League organizations absorbed mostly bad students. Wang Jiesan's purpose in doing this was very clear, mainly to undermine the Party's prestige among the masses.
    At the expanded meeting of the Provincial and Municipal Committees of the China Democratic League, Su Zishen, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and member of the China Democratic League, said: Wang Jiesan insisted that bureaucracy appeared in the socialist system. This is a vicious slander. Everyone knows that bureaucracy is a product of the capitalist system. The meeting also exposed Wang Jiesan's act of setting fires everywhere, as well as his relationship with many right-wing elements, to illustrate their conspiracy to attack the Party in mutual cooperation and support.
    After Wang Jiesan's vicious conspiracy was exposed, he shamelessly said that his reactionary remarks were "unconscious." He also said that the emergence of his reactionary remarks was mainly because he had "resistance" to the Party, and listed the reasons for the "resistance." These lies of his were immediately exposed by others who knew the situation. However, after the lies were exposed, Wang Jiesan still refused to honestly examine himself.
    At the discussion meetings held by the Provincial Committee of the RCCK and the Normal College, many people who were familiar with Wang Jiesan's history and had suffered from him spoke out one after another, exposing his past crimes. Wang Jiesan's old classmate, Sun Guangyu, exposed the process of Wang organizing the "Evolution Society" during the "May Fourth" era, and exposed his crimes of persecuting progressive teachers and students in the past. Dong Xijun (former teacher of Zhongshan Street Primary School in Mei County, now lecturer at Shaanxi Normal College), Pang Jizhen (former person in charge of Jingyang Jinggan Middle School), Wang Zhenxi (teacher at Xianyang Industrial School), Chen Weicheng (Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League), who had been persecuted by him, also exposed Wang's crimes of persecuting them when he was the head of the puppet education department. This series of facts tore apart his "progressive" face, forcing him to admit that he had been a rightist since the "May Fourth" Movement, and admitted that he was the "most poisonous weed" (For details of Wang Jiesan's reactionary words and deeds, see page 2 of today's newspaper).

    王捷三是五四以来的老牌右派
    陕西各界揭露了他的丑恶历史
    本报西安22日电　从6月12日起到7月上旬，民革陕西省常委扩大会、西安师范学院举行了几十次座谈会，批判王捷三的反动言论，并揭露他过去一贯反共、反人民的丑恶历史。与此同时，西安市工人、市民以及王捷三家乡韩城的群众，也纷纷来信批判和揭露他的反动言论和过去的反动罪行。
    西安师范学院语文系高元白教授用语文系党、团员的学习成绩来说明王捷三对党、团员的污蔑。王捷三完全无中生有地对党、团员进行污蔑，说党、团组织吸收的多是坏学生。王捷三这样做的目的是很清楚的，主要是破坏党在群众中的威信。
    在民盟省、市委扩大会上，陕西省农业厅副厅长、民盟盟员苏资琛说：王捷三硬说官僚主义是在社会主义制度出现的。这是毒恶的污蔑。谁都知道官僚主义是资本主义制度产物。会议上还揭露了王捷三四处点火的事实，以及他和许多右派分子的关系，来说明他们在互相配合、互相支持下向党进攻的阴谋。
    当王捷三的恶毒阴谋被揭穿以后，他厚颜无耻地说，他的反动言论“是不自觉的”。他又说他的反动言论的产生，主要是因为他对党有“抵触情绪”，并罗列了产生“抵触情绪”的原因。他这些谎言当场就被其他了解情况的人揭穿。但是，当谎言被揭穿后，王捷三仍然不肯老实地检查自己。
    在民革省常委会、师范学院举行的座谈会上，有很多熟悉王捷三历史和身受其害的人纷纷发言，揭露他过去的罪行。王捷三的老同学孙广玉揭露王在“五四”时代组织“进化社”的经过，并揭露了他在过去迫害进步教师和学生的罪行。身受他迫害过的董锡钧（原郿县中山街小学教员，现任陕西师范学院讲师）、庞继震（原泾阳泾干中学负责人）、王振溪（咸阳工业学校教师）、陈唯诚（民盟西安市委宣传部副部长）等，也都纷纷揭发王在任伪教育厅长时迫害他们的罪行。这一连串的事实，撕破了他那副“进步人士”的面孔，使他不得不承认，从“五四”运动以来，他就是一个右派，承认他是“最毒的毒草”（关于王捷三的反动言行详见今日本报二版）。
