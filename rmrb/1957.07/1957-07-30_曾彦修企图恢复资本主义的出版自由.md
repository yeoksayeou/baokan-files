In this wild attack against the Communist Party and socialism, some right-wing elements, under the guise of implementing the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, attempted to restore capitalist publishing freedom. The absurd remarks of right-wing element Zeng Yanxiu are a prominent example.

At the Central Propaganda Conference in March this year, the People's Daily symposium in April, and two symposiums at the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture in May, Zeng Yanxiu repeatedly stated: "Publishing work has rarely discussed guidelines in recent years. What exactly are the guidelines?" "In recent years, there have been no clear guidelines in publishing work." "Before the 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' policy, publishing work had no guidelines and no leadership."

Why did Zeng Yanxiu raise this issue whenever he had the opportunity? Was it true that before the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy was put forward, China's publishing work really had no guidelines and no leadership?

As everyone knows, in October 1949, when the People's Republic of China was just proclaimed, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference in Beijing (at that time, the Xinhua Bookstore was an organization combining publishing and distribution), which clearly stipulated that "the future publishing industry must first serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to this end, we must vigorously publish popular reading materials beneficial to the people." (People's Daily editorial, October 21, 1949) In September 1950, the First National Publishing Conference adopted a resolution on the basic guidelines for developing the people's publishing industry, pointing out that "serving the interests of the broad masses of the people is the basic guideline of the people's publishing industry." At the First National Publishing Administration Conference in August 1951, Ye Shengtao, on behalf of the Publishing Administration, made a report "Strive to Improve the Quality of Publications," which more specifically proposed the following publishing tasks: (1) Strengthen the promotion of Marxism-Leninism; (2) Strengthen the publication of popular reading materials; (3) Increase financial, economic, and technical publications. Since then, the Publishing Administration and the later Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture have focused on strengthening the promotion of Marxism-Leninism, strengthening the publication of popular reading materials, and increasing scientific and technological publications when summarizing their work and talking about guidelines and tasks each year.

Zeng Yanxiu had held leading positions in the propaganda department and had been responsible for specific business in the People's Publishing House for three or four years. He could not possibly be unaware of this situation. Therefore, his repeated clamoring that publishing work had no guidelines and no leadership was in fact a vehement opposition to these guidelines, a denial of these guidelines, and an attempt to overturn and change these guidelines.

Let's take a look at Zeng Yanxiu's fallacies:

First, Zeng Yanxiu opposed the promotion of Marxism-Leninism under the pretext of opposing dogmatism. "For a long time, we couldn't see the direction of the entire publishing industry, only dogmatism." This is Zeng Yanxiu's overall assessment of China's publishing industry since liberation. Then, what exactly is the "dogmatism" he sees? He revealed it at the Publishing Bureau symposium on May 10: "Last year, the bureau came up with a twelve-year perspective plan... among which the first is to publish Marxism-Leninism... Can we establish the country solely on some dogmatic pamphlets?" No wonder Zeng Yanxiu constantly clamored to "print fewer books on Marxism-Leninism."

Second, Zeng Yanxiu believes that dogmatism was learned from the Soviet Union, so he resolutely opposes learning from the Soviet Union, and opposes publishing a large number of popular reading materials because he says: "After liberation, most of the energy and paper were used to translate Soviet pamphlets, which is simply useless." He also said: "After liberation, academic works were basically stopped, and Soviet pamphlets were allowed to flood the market." This is another overall assessment by Zeng Yanxiu of China's publishing industry after liberation. At the Publishing Bureau symposium on May 10, Zeng Yanxiu even came to a clearer conclusion: "In the past few years since liberation, only some dogmatic pamphlets and picture books have been published, and no truly significant works have been published."

Is this really the case? Not to mention the seven years since liberation, nor the whole country, let's just talk about the situation of the People's Publishing House, where Zeng Yanxiu worked, from 1951 to 1953. The report of the Central Propaganda Department on improving the work of the People's Publishing House, which was approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in April 1954, pointed out: The People's Publishing House "The main publications in the past three years are: works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Chairman Mao, works by other responsible comrades of the Party, important documents of the Party and the government, some works of Soviet philosophy and social sciences, some social science works of our country, and books to cooperate with various political movements and cadre studies. Among them, the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Chairman Mao occupy a prominent position and are increasing year by year." This report also made very specific instructions on the publishing guidelines of the People's Publishing House.

Zeng Yanxiu was the person in charge of the People's Publishing House starting in 1954. However, after taking office, he made a completely different assessment of the past work of the People's Publishing House from that of the Party Central Committee: complete negation. And today, he is still shouting everywhere that the entire publishing industry has no guidelines and no leadership. What exactly are Zeng Yanxiu's intentions?

Zeng Yanxiu seems to be very supportive of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. He repeatedly proclaims that the publishing system should be considered on the basis of the "two hundreds" policy, and in order to adapt to the "two hundreds" policy, the leadership institutions must be thoroughly studied and improved. However, Zeng Yanxiu's understanding of the so-called "two hundreds" policy is obviously completely different from the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy put forward by the Party Central Committee.

Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a policy for promoting the development of art and the progress of science, and a policy for promoting the prosperity of our socialist culture." But Zeng Yanxiu and other right-wing elements are not interested in the word "socialist" in it, so they so resolutely oppose learning from the Soviet Union.

Lu Dingyi pointed out in the report "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" (May 1956): "For literary and artistic work, the Party has only one requirement, that is, 'serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.'" This is also something that Zeng Yanxiu and other right-wing elements cannot agree with, so they so fiercely oppose the publication of popular reading materials (pamphlets).

The People's Daily editorial "Continue to Liberate Thinking and Implement the Policy of 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend'" (April 1957) pointed out: "The working class-led state also takes all necessary steps to educate the people with advanced Marxist ideas... Therefore, implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is precisely the necessary way to correctly realize Marxist leadership." Zeng Yanxiu and other right-wing elements are unwilling to understand it in this way, so they viciously attack the so-called "dogmatism" and advocate "printing fewer books on Marxism-Leninism."

How do right-wing elements understand the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend?" Zhou Yang's "Answers to Wenhui Daily Reporter on the Question of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" (April 1957) best expresses their state of mind. He said:

"Opportunists 'welcome' the policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend', but they 'welcome' it with a different mood, because they are already a little tired of things like Marxist materialism and the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now that there is a new policy, they can righteously treat Marxism, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, etc., as something like 'dogmatism' and 'vulgar sociology' all at once, as if not doing so would hinder the implementation of this new policy."

Isn't Zeng Yanxiu's mood like this? He said he "wrote some short articles to oppose dogmatism and support a hundred schools of thought contend." Let's take a look at his short articles.

On February 10, 1957, he used the pseudonym "Yan Xiu" to publish a short article "Thoughts on Reading 'Titles'" in the People's Daily, saying that he had the opportunity to read some research plans and writing plans of universities, Party schools, and scientific institutions, and could hardly read them because "a large part of these research topics are also so mediocre, gray, and boring." He believes that it must be "boastful talk and dogmatic papers and pamphlets." It should be explained here that these research plans of universities, Party schools, and scientific institutions are a new phenomenon that emerged after the Party Central Committee issued the call to "march toward science," but Zeng Yanxiu believes that these plans and topics do not conform to his policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," as if there is too much Marxism, and therefore he uniformly dismisses them as "dogmatism."

Now we understand what Zeng Yanxiu opposes. Then, what does he hope for? He didn't explain this very clearly, but the message is revealed in his words. For example, he said that "academic works were basically stopped after liberation, and Soviet pamphlets were allowed to flood the market." In fact, quite a few academic works that are Marxist or serve socialist economic and cultural construction have been published. Zeng Yanxiu hopes to change this situation, so he has to let so-called "academic works" that are anti-Marxist or serve the restoration of capitalism flood the market.

In order to cleverly realize this hope, Zeng Yanxiu advocates eliminating the distinction between Marxism and non-Marxism in China. He believes that "on the issues of Chinese Malthusians and Keynesianism, we cannot simply talk about who is an 'ist' and who is an 'ist'. From our internal perspective, this is sectarianism." Look, he is opposing "sectarianism" again.

Of course, he has not forgotten the issue of publishing system and leadership. He advocates running "fellow traveler publishing houses," letting the relevant publishing houses find their own "backers," and letting various associations and academic organizations lead them. No wonder he hates the leadership of the Party and the state over publishing work so much. He believes that the team of the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture "can be disbanded," and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee can have a minister plus an assistant to manage "policy issues."

Now it is clear. What Zeng Yanxiu and other right-wing elements hope for is to restore capitalist publishing freedom in China and let the so-called "academic works" of the bourgeoisie flood the market?

At the symposium of the Publishing Bureau, Zeng Yanxiu shouted wildly, "The morale of all units is high, and we can't wait a day longer." He and another right-wing element, Lan Yu, repeatedly demanded that the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Culture hold a seven-day to one-month "democratic conference" to solve the so-called publishing guidelines and system issues. What a rampant attack!

Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They want to struggle against the working class in various aspects, including ideological struggle." The situation of Zeng Yanxiu and other right-wing elements is like this.

    曾彦修企图恢复资本主义的出版自由
    梁纯夫
    在这次向共产党和社会主义的猖狂进攻中，有些右派分子曾假借了贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的名义，企图恢复资本主义的出版自由。右派分子曾彦修的荒谬言论便是显著的例子。
    曾彦修在今年3月的中央宣传会议，4月的人民日报座谈会，和5月的文化部出版局两次座谈会上，一再提出：“出版工作几年来很少谈方针。方针究竟何在？”、“近几年来在出版工作中没有明确方针。”“出版工作在‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’方针以前，是没有方针也没有领导的。”
    曾彦修为什么一有机会便提出这个问题呢？是不是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针提出以前，我国的出版工作真的没有方针和没有领导呢？
    大家知道，1949年10月，中华人民共和国刚刚宣告成立，中共中央宣传部便在北京召开全国新华书店出版工作会议（当时的新华书店是出版和发行合一的机构），明确规定了“今后的出版事业首先要为工农兵服务，为此就必须大力出版有益于人民的通俗读物。”（1949年10月21日人民日报社论）1950年9月第一届全国出版会议又通过关于发展人民出版事业的基本方针的决议，指出“为人民大众的利益服务是人民出版事业的基本方针”。在1951年8月第一届全国出版行政会议上，叶圣陶代表出版总署作“为提高出版物的质量而奋斗”的报告，更具体地提出下列出版任务：（一）加强马克思列宁主义的宣传；（二）加强通俗读物的出版工作；（三）增加财经的、技术的出版物。以后出版总署和后来的文化部出版局每年总结工作和谈到方针任务时，都着重在加强马克思列宁主义的宣传、加强通俗读物的出版工作、增加科学技术的出版物等几个方面。
    曾彦修曾在宣传部门担任领导工作，在人民出版社负责具体业务也有三、四年，决不会不知道这种情况。那么，他一再叫嚷出版工作没有方针也没有领导，事实上是他深恶痛绝地反对这些方针，否定这些方针，要推翻和改变这些方针。
    请看看曾彦修的谬论吧：
    第一，曾彦修是在大喊反对教条主义的借口下来反对宣传马克思列宁主义的。“我们长期看不出整个出版界的方向，只看到教条主义”。这就是曾彦修对解放以来我国出版事业的总估价。那么，他所看到的“教条主义”，究竟是些什么东西呢？他5月10日在出版局座谈会上说出来了：“去年局里搞了个十二年远景规划……其中第一要出马列主义……难道我们单靠一些教条主义的小册子就能立国吗？”无怪曾彦修不断地叫嚷“可以少印马列主义”的书了。
    第二，曾彦修认为教条主义是我们从苏联学来的，因此他坚决反对学习苏联，又因反对学习苏联而反对大量出版通俗读物，因为据他说：“解放后大部分的力量和纸张都用于翻译苏联的小册子，这简直没有用。”又说：“解放后基本上停止了学术著作，而让苏联的小册子泛滥于市场。”这就是曾彦修对解放后我国出版事业的另一总估价。在5月10日出版局的座谈会上，曾彦修甚至下了一个更明确的结论：“解放后几年来，光出了一些教条主义的小册子、连环画，没有真正出过一些有份量的东西。”
    难道这是事实吗？不说解放后七年来，也不说全国范围，就单谈谈曾彦修所在的单位人民出版社1951年到1953年的情况吧。1954年4月经过中共中央批示的中宣部关于改进人民出版社工作状况的报告中指出：人民出版社“三年来的主要出版物有：马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作，党的其他负责同志的著作，党和政府的重要文件，苏联哲学和社会科学的一部分著作，我国的一部分社会科学著作，以及配合各项政治运动和干部学习的书籍。其中，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的著作占有显著地位，并年有增加。”这个报告对人民出版社的出书方针还作了很具体的指示。
    曾彦修正是1954年开始负责人民出版社的工作的。但是他到任之后，对人民出版社过去的工作便作了同党中央完全不同的估价：全盘否定。而到了今天，他还到处大叫整个出版事业没有方针没有领导。曾彦修究竟居心何在呢？
    曾彦修好像非常拥护“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，他一再宣扬要在“二百”方针的基础上来考虑出版制度，而为了要适应“二百”方针，从领导机构都要彻底研究改进。但是，曾彦修所了解的所谓“二百”方针，显然同党中央所提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是毫无共同之处的。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。”但是曾彦修和其他右派分子对于其中“社会主义”这个词儿是不感兴趣的，所以他们那么坚决地反对学习苏联。
    陆定一在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的报告（1956年5月）中指出：“对于文学艺术工作，党只有一个要求，就是‘为工农兵服务’”。这也是曾彦修和其他右派分子所不能同意的，所以他们那样凶猛地反对出版通俗读物（小册子）。
    人民日报社论：“继续放手，贯彻‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’的方针”（1957年4月）中指出：“工人阶级所领导的国家也采取各种必要的步骤，用先进的马克思主义的思想来教育人民……因此，贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，正是正确地实现马克思主义领导的必要的方法。”曾彦修和其他右派分子却不愿意作这样的了解，因此他们那样恶毒地攻击所谓“教条主义”，主张“少印马列主义”的书。
    右派分子究竟怎样了解“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针呢？周扬的就“百花齐放、百家争鸣问题答文汇报记者问”（1957年4月）最能道出他们的心境，他说：
    “机会主义者对于‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’方针倒是表示‘欢迎’的，但他们是抱着另外一种心情来‘欢迎’的，因为他们对马克思主义唯物主义、工农兵方向等等东西，早已有些厌倦了，现在既然有了新的方针，就可以理直气壮地把马克思主义、工农兵方向等等都当作什么‘教条主义’、‘庸俗社会学’一古脑儿摔掉，好像不这样就会妨碍这个新的方针的执行似的。”
    曾彦修的心情不正是这样吗？他说他“写了一些短文章来反对教条主义，拥护百家争鸣”。让我们来看看他的短文章吧。
    1957年2月10日他用“严秀”的笔名在人民日报发表了一篇“读‘题’有感”的短文章，说他有机会读到了一些高等学校、党校和科学机关的研究计划和写作计划，几乎读不下去，因为“这些研究题目中的很大一部分也是那样地平庸、灰色、枯燥”，他认为一定是“夸夸其谈和教条主义的论文和小册子”。这里应该说明，这些高等学校、党校、科学机关的研究计划，是在党中央提出“向科学进军”的号召之后出现的新现象，但是曾彦修认为这些计划和题目并不符合于他的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，似乎是马克思主义太多了，因此一律斥之为“教条主义”。
    现在我们弄明白，曾彦修所反对的是什么了。那么，他所希望的又是什么呢？这点他没有交代得很明白，但言词间是透露了消息的。例如他说“解放后基本上停止了学术著作，而让苏联的小册子泛滥市场”。事实上马克思主义的或为社会主义经济、文化建设服务的学术著作是出了不少的，曾彦修希望改变这种状态，就只好让反马克思主义的或为资本主义复辟服务的所谓“学术著作”泛滥市场了。
    为了巧妙地实现这种希望，曾彦修主张在中国消除马克思主义和非马克思主义的区别。他认为“关于中国马尔萨斯主义者问题、凯恩斯主义等问题，现在不能简单地谈论某某是什么主义者，某某又是什么主义者，从我们内部来讲，这是宗派主义的作法”。请看吧，他又在反对“宗派主义”了。
    当然，他也没有忘记还有出版的体制和领导问题。他主张办“同人出版社”，让有关的出版社各自找自己的“后台老板”，交各协会、各学术机关团体领导。无怪他那样憎恶党和国家对出版工作的领导。他认为文化部出版局这个班子“可以散掉”，中宣部有一个部长加个助手管管“方针政策问题”就行了。
    这样就明白了。曾彦修和其他右派分子所希望的，不就是在中国恢复资本主义的出版自由，让资产阶级的所谓“学术著作”泛滥市场吗？
    在出版局的座谈会上，曾彦修竟狂叫“目前各单位情绪高涨，是一天也不能等了”。他和另一右派分子蓝钰一再要求中宣部和文化部举行七天至一个月的“民主大会”，来解决所谓出版方针和体制问题。多么猖狂的进攻！
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”曾彦修和其他右派分子的情形就是这样。
