Be Vigilant Against Extraordinary Floods in the Yellow River
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Historically, the Yellow River has been the most harmful river in our country. According to historical records, the Yellow River has flooded and breached its banks more than 1,500 times in over 3,000 years, with 26 major course changes, including nine major diversions. In the last hundred years, it has breached its banks more than 200 times. Each breach and diversion has brought great disasters and losses to the people. It threatens the safety of 250,000 square kilometers of farmland and 80 million people.

    During the Kuomintang rule, due to the lack of management of river defenses and the dilapidated state of the dikes, there were several breaches. In 1933, there were more than 50 breaches, affecting 16.65 million mu of land and killing more than 18,000 people.

    Since 1934, the Qin factory flow was only 8,500 cubic meters per second, and a breach also occurred in Guantai. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan Province, causing the Yellow River to flood, inundating 81 million mu of land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and killing 890,000 people.

    Since the people of the liberated areas took control of the Yellow River in 1946, for eleven years until now, a large amount of investment has been made in the Yellow River every year, and the Yellow River dikes have been strengthened and reinforced year by year, earth dams have been replaced with stone dams, the dikes have been probed to eliminate hidden dangers, and eleven years of major floods have been safely passed. In 1954, although the Qin factory flow reached 15,000 cubic meters per second, it was also safely discharged. These achievements are great. However, before the project of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River is completed, the struggle against Yellow River floods is still an arduous task.

    Since the beginning of this flood season, the Qin factory station on the Yellow River (this year, the flow is measured at Huayuankou) has experienced four major flood peaks in succession, especially the flood peak of 12,600 cubic meters per second at 9:00 on July 19 and the flood peak of 13,000 cubic meters per second at 19:00 on the 19th, which are the second largest flood peaks since liberation (15,000 cubic meters per second in 1954). After this flood peak appeared, the responsible comrades of the Party and government of Henan and Shandong provinces and more than 1,200 cadres from prefectures and counties along the river led 200,000 people to the dikes to defend them day and night. The central leading comrades also instructed to ensure the safety of the Yellow River, and all preparations should be made from the worst-case scenario. The people of the whole country and the central leading comrades are closely watching the changes in the flood season of the Yellow River, demanding that we overcome the floods.

    The situation of the Yellow River this year is relatively serious. After the flood peaks of 12,600 cubic meters per second and 13,000 cubic meters per second from Huayuankou were discharged together, most or all of the floodplains of Dongming, Puyang, Fanxian, Heze, Juancheng, Shouzhang, and Yuncheng counties were flooded, with water depths of 5 decimeters to 1.5 meters. In Liaocheng and Heze, some water depths reached 3 meters, and some dikes were submerged by water up to 5 meters. In addition, the water level of Dongping Lake is very high due to the incoming water from the Dawen River, which has raised the water level downstream, making the situation even more tense.

    After this flood peak reached Gaocun, the water level was 0.8 meters higher than the 1954 Qin factory flood peak of 15,000 cubic meters per second; at Sunkou, it exceeded the guaranteed water level by 0.16 meters, 1.18 meters higher than the 1954 water level; and at Aishan, it was 0.84 meters higher than the 1954 water level. This shows that the riverbed downstream of Gaocun is generally silting up. If a flood similar to that of 1954 occurs again, the water level downstream of Gaocun may be much higher than the 1954 flood level. This situation must be paid attention to.

    After this flood test, the existing projects are not yet what we ideally want. To varying degrees, dangers such as slope collapses, root rock subsidence, cracks, and piping seepage have appeared in Dongming, Dong'a, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Fanxian, and Qihe counties, which should also be paid attention to.

    What is the rainfall situation since the beginning of this flood season? From July 6 to 16, in the ten days in the area north of the Huai River and south of the Yellow River in Henan, and in the western and southern parts of Shandong, the rainfall was generally between 300 millimeters and 500 millimeters, and some areas, such as Lushan, reached 719 millimeters. The ten-day rainfall in Henan accounted for about 70% of the annual rainfall, and in some areas in southwestern Shandong, it approached the annual rainfall. This year, the rainfall is not only characterized by many rainstorms, large rainfall, and long duration, but also by particularly high intensity. The daily rainfall in Dushuzhen, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, reached 366.9 millimeters. In Caoxian, Shandong Province, the rainfall reached 235 millimeters within nine hours from 9:00 to 18:00 on July 10. In many places, the daily rainfall reached more than 200 millimeters. Therefore, a flood peak of 10,500 cubic meters per second appeared at Shahe Yexian Station in Henan on July 10. In Linyi, Shandong, the largest flood peak of 15,500 cubic meters per second appeared on July 19, breaking the record for the largest flood since records began.

    The Yellow River is currently in the flood season, and even larger floods may occur in the next one or two months. From July 6 to 16 this year, there were many rainstorms, long duration, and high intensity between the Yellow River and the Huai River. In the future, rainstorms like those in Henan and Shandong may also occur in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River. Currently, it is the season for rainstorms and typhoons. Last year, North China was affected by typhoons, and continuous rainfall from August 2 to 13 caused a particularly large flood disaster in North China. The Yellow River floods are related to the safety of the lives and property of the vast number of people in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. After this flood test, the Yellow River dikes still have many dangers, and the riverbed is silting up. If a flood that occurs once in a century occurs, the actual situation will be worse than our original estimates. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant against extraordinary floods in the Yellow River. In terms of ideology, organization, and flood prevention preparation, we should proceed from the worst-case scenario, summarize the experience of this flood, check, repair, and reinforce the dike projects at any time, and make arrangements in advance for the preparatory work for flood detention and diversion measures in the event of extraordinary floods and all possible complex problems. In this way, flood prevention work can take the initiative, overcome floods, and prevent and reduce disasters.

    警惕黄河出现特大洪水
    本报评论员
    黄河在历史上是我国一条为害最大的河流。据历史记载，黄河在三千多年中泛滥决口一千五百多次，重要的改道二十六次，其中大改道九次。近百年来决口二百多次。每次决口改道都给人民带来很大的灾难和损失。它威胁着二十五万平方公里的田地和八千万人口的安全。
    在国民党统治时期，因对河防不加治理，堤防残破，曾数次决口。1933年决口五十多处，受灾面积一千六百五十万亩，死一万八千多人。
      自1934年秦厂流量仅八千五百秒公方，贯台也发生了决口。1938年蒋介石还在河南省花园口把河堤故意扒开，使黄水泛滥，豫、皖、苏诸省淹地八千一百万亩，死亡八十九万人。
    自1946年解放区人民掌握了黄河以后，到现在十一年，每年对黄河都有大量的投资，逐年把黄河堤防进行培修加固，改埽坝为石坝，锥探堤身，消灭隐患，安全渡过了十一年大汛。1954年秦厂流量虽达一万五千秒公方，也安全下泄。这些成绩是伟大的。但是在根治黄河的工程完成以前，与黄河洪水斗争还是艰苦的任务。
    今年入汛以来，黄河秦厂站（今年改在花园口施测流量）连续出现了四次大的洪峰，尤以7月19日九时出现一万二千六百秒公方的洪峰和19日十九时出现一万三千秒公方的洪峰，为解放以来第二次大洪峰（1954年一万五千秒公方）。这个洪峰出现以后，豫、鲁两省党政负责同志和沿河专、县干部一千二百多人，带领二十万群众上堤昼夜防守。中央领导同志也指示要确保黄河的安全，一切准备要从最坏处作打算。全国人民和中央领导同志都在密切注视着黄河汛期的变化，要求我们战胜洪水。
    今年黄河情况是比较严重的。花园口一万二千六百秒公方和一万三千秒公方洪峰相并下泄以后，到东明、?阳、范县、菏泽、鄄城、寿张、郓城等县大部或全部漫滩行洪，水深5公寸到1.5公尺，聊城，菏泽有的水深3公尺，大堤偎水有的达5公尺。再加东平湖由于大汶河来水，水位很高，抬高了下游的水位，使情况更加紧张。
    这个洪峰到高村后，水位比1954年秦厂一万五千秒公方洪峰高0.8公尺，到孙口超过保证水位0.16公尺，比1954年水位高出1.18公尺；到艾山比1954年水位高出0.84公尺。这说明高村以下河床普遍淤高。如果再出现和1954年同样的洪水，则高村以下水位可能要比1954年的洪水位高出很多。这种情况必须引起我们注意。
    经过这次洪水考验，已有的工程也还不是我们所理想的。在东明、东阿、鄄城、郓城、范县、齐河等县出现了塌坡、根石沉陷、裂缝、管涌渗水等不同程度的险情，这也是应当引起注意的。
    今年入汛以来降雨情况是怎样呢？自7月6日至16日，十天中在河南的淮河以北黄河以南地区，和山东的西部、南部地区，降雨一般在三百公厘到五百公厘，有的地区如鲁山竟达七百一十九公厘，十天的降雨量在河南约占全年降雨量70％，山东西南部有的地区接近全年降雨量。今年降雨量不但暴雨多、雨量大、时间长，而且强度特大。河南省方城县独树镇日雨量达三百六十六点九公厘，山东曹县7月10日九时至十八时九小时内降雨量达二百三十五公厘，很多的地方日雨量达二百公厘以上，因之在河南沙河叶县站7月10日出现一万零五百秒公方的洪峰。在山东临沂7月19日出现一万五千五百秒公方的最大洪峰。都打破了有记录以来的最大洪水。
    现在黄河正在汛期，今后一、二个月内还可能发生更大的洪水。今年7月6日至16日黄河淮河间暴雨多，时间长，强度大。今后黄河中上游还可能出现像河南、山东这样暴雨。目前正是暴雨台风季节，去年华北受台风影响，自8月2日至13日连续降雨，造成华北特大洪水灾害。黄河的洪水关系着冀、鲁、豫、皖、苏五省广大人民生命财产的安全，黄河堤防经这次洪水考验还有很多险情，河床淤高。如发生百年一遇的洪水，实际情况会比我们原来的估计更坏。因此我们对黄河特大洪水必须提高警惕，在思想上组织上和防汛准备上，应从最坏的情况出发，总结这次洪水的经验，对堤防工程要随时检查补修加固，对特大洪水发生时滞洪分洪等措施的准备工作和可能发生的一切复杂问题，都要事先有所安排。这样防汛工作才能争取主动、战胜洪水，防止和减少灾害。
