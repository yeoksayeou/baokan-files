The ideology of the landlord class has not died
Liu Jixue persistently reactionary, vainly attempting restoration

According to a report from the Henan Daily, at a symposium held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) on July 6th, the participants thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary criminal history and reactionary words and deeds of rightist Liu Jixue, deputy chairman of the RCCK Henan Provincial Committee, before and after liberation.

Duan Ruohong said: Since Liu Jixue was forced to surrender to the people, he has always harbored hatred for the Communist Party. Therefore, he often spread absurd remarks and viciously attacked the Communist Party. In 1951, while studying "A Reader on the Chinese Revolution," he said, "Since ancient times, it has always been 'scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants,' with 'scholars' placed first because 'scholars' are the head of the four classes of people. Workers are 'both poor and ignorant,' how can such people lead?" In 1950, when everyone was joyfully celebrating the Communist Party's birthday, Liu Jixue scolded, "What is the Communist Party?" Shi Xirong said: Once, Comrade Zhang Xi, former secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC, gave a report, and someone asked, "Who is this?" Liu Jixue said, "Isn't that the blabbermouth Zhang Xi!" Duan Ruohong said that it was very clear that Liu Jixue was opposing the Communist Party and insulting the Communist Party from the standpoint of the reactionary class.

Duan Ruohong then exposed Liu Jixue's organizational activities aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party. He said: Not only did Liu Jixue actively engage in anti-Communist and anti-people activities before liberation, but also in the early days of liberation, when Liu Jixue served as the convener of the RCCK Henan organization, he believed that it was a good opportunity to gather anti-Communist forces. Under the planning of his chiefs of staff, Li Jingzhi, Wang Youmei, and Song Yuxiu, he wantonly absorbed counter-revolutionaries to join the organization, attempting to turn the RCCK into an anti-Communist base. This included Sun Shangyang, a counter-revolutionary element stained with blood debts who had already been suppressed, and Wang Youmei. He also prepared to absorb Guo Xiaobai. After learning about this situation, Guo Xiaobai immediately went to Sichuan to contact Zhan Junfu and Guo Xiaofang (director of the pseudo-Three People's Principles Youth League), who were fleeing bandits from Xincai County. He said to these two bandit leaders, "I am going to work in Kaifeng, and this is an opportunity. I will carry out activities there, and you will carry out activities outside. Later, we will look for opportunities to cooperate from the inside and outside" to launch a riot. Some time ago, Liu Jixue and his chief of staff, Li Jingzhi, also attempted to lower the qualifications for developing the RCCK organization, absorbing "Three-Anti" targets, "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" targets, those who had been purged, and those who hated the Party into the RCCK organization, in order to expand the ranks as political capital to confront the Communist Party; advocated that the RCCK develop in small cities and develop young people. When the Communist Party began the rectification campaign, they jointly planned to collect, distort, and fabricate facts everywhere to attack the Communist Party.

Liu Jixue has consistently resisted the policies of the Party and the People's Government and opposed the socialist system. Duan Ruohong said: During the land reform, Liu Jixue said with great dissatisfaction, "For many years, landlords have supported the peasants; otherwise, the peasants would have starved to death long ago." In 1954, Liu Jixue also said, "During the land reform, it was said that landlords exploited peasants. I don't understand the word 'exploitation.' The money earned from doing things yourself is reasonable and legal to buy land. At that time, tenants had to be grateful to the landlords for letting them cultivate the land; if they were not allowed to cultivate the land, they would starve to death. It was a favor to let them cultivate the land." He also said, "The so-called 'feudal' landlord, this sentence is also incomprehensible. 'Feng' is the 'feudal' in 'feudal territory,' and 'Jian' is the 'establishment' in 'establishing a city.' The emperor enfeoffs a certain place to someone, and the tax revenue belongs to him; this is called 'feudalism.' But the landlord spends his own money to buy land; who enfeoffs him? Who establishes him? It is also possible to divide the land, and I advocate peaceful land distribution, without struggle." Because Liu Jixue opposed land reform, he left halfway through two important mobilization meetings on land reform held by the province. Duan Ruohong said that Liu Jixue also vigorously opposed and wantonly slandered the Party and government's policy of unified purchase and sales. He once said, "Now that grain is under unified purchase and sales, there is nowhere to beg for food; you can only turn around and go back." Liu Jixue's reactionary stance and vicious conspiracy were also manifested in his slander of the socialist system. He once said, "Socialism looks pretty good on the surface, but there are actually many problems." He also said, "Socialism is moving too fast, and agricultural cooperativization is moving too fast!" See, isn't Liu Jixue's purpose in saying this to incite the masses to oppose the new society and let the landlords and bourgeoisie restore their power?

Liu Jixue was very dissatisfied with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He said, "Although I personally have not suffered excessive oppression, there have been cases of torture and beatings, forcing people to death, and imprisonment in the countryside during the revolution." Liu Jixue also slandered the masses' magnificent revolutionary actions as "using violence to replace violence." Duan Ruohong said: Liu Jixue represents his relatives and close friends, such as his friend Chen Guanqun, who was a executioner who shot dozens of students in Baoding. When he saw the announcement of the criminal's suppression, he expressed regret. In addition, counter-revolutionaries Guo Xiaobai, Duan Houfu, Mei Zimei, Zhang Jianhua, and Wang Youmei, the executioner of the Zhugou Incident, were all Liu Jixue's relatives and close friends, or his capable generals. Liu Jixue's nephews Liu Can'e and Liu Peizhi, and his uncles and brothers Liu Qingyuan, etc., were all evil landlords and counter-revolutionaries who were suppressed, for whom Liu Jixue cried injustice, and are all the factual basis for Liu Jixue's vicious slander of excessive actions in the countryside revolution!

The speakers widely exposed Liu Jixue's anti-Communist criminal history.

He Shengping said: I have known Liu Jixue for a very long time, and my understanding of him is also the clearest. Liu Jixue has been firmly opposed to the Communist Party throughout his history. He was a member of the Kuomintang Xishan Conference faction and a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee at the time. They started by opposing communism and made opposing communism their lifelong career. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely implemented the Three Great Policies, Liu Jixue's faction stood up to oppose them. After Mr. Sun's death, they openly and brazenly supported Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of communists. This is the "April 12th" incident in history. People like Dai Jitao, Zhang Ji, Xie Chi, Zou Lu, and Liu Jixue were the most determined in advocating the killing of communists. He Shengping pointed out angrily: Liu Jixue served as a member of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan and speaker of the Henan Provincial Council for twenty years, and countless people lost their heads with just a wave of his hand. The hand that Liu Jixue raised was indeed stained with the blood of working people and revolutionary martyrs.

Bie Guangdian said that before liberation, Liu Jixue had many henchmen in Henan, and they were the most stubborn anti-Communist and anti-people group. People like Guo Zhongkui and the already suppressed Wang Youmei were all generals in this group. For a long time, they entrenched themselves on the reactionary political stage of Henan, oppressing and exploiting the people, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. The people of Henan called them "local snakes." Liu Jixue was the leader of this group. This group all listened to Liu Jixue's words, and under his instructions, Wang Youmei colluded with Bie Tingfang, a great tyrant in Wanxi, and also killed many revolutionary comrades and revolutionary masses in the Wandong area; Guo Zhongkui also killed many revolutionary comrades in the Liuhe Incident, which was truly heinous. Gao Yangyuan, Fang Xihua, and others exposed that on the eve of the liberation of Henan, Liu Jixue personally took charge of formulating a "security plan," and also appealed to Chiang Kai-shek to send five armies to be permanently stationed in the province to "suppress bandits," and to organize three to five divisions of provincial defense forces to use them in a concentrated manner; proposed compulsory donations of grain and funds to be used as "bandit suppression" expenses; advocated concentrating all forces to engage in "bandit suppression" work. On the eve of the liberation of Kaifeng, Liu Jixue was still in Xinyang instructing his confidants to organize scattered bandits to join forces to oppose communism.

During the symposium, many people spoke out demanding that rightists Liu Jixue and Li Jingzhi thoroughly confess their criminal activities, otherwise they would cut themselves off from the people.

    地主阶级的思想还没有死
    刘积学一贯反动妄图复辟
    据河南日报报道　在7月6日民革河南省委召开的座谈会，深入揭发了右派分子民革河南省副主委刘积学的反共罪恶历史和解放后的反动言行。
    段若虹说：刘积学自被迫投降人民以来，对共产党始终是仇恨的，因此他常常散布荒谬言论，恶毒地向共产党进攻。1951年学习中国革命读本时，他曾说：“自古以来都是‘士、农、工、商’，把‘士’摆在前面，是因‘士’为四民之首。工人‘既穷且愚’，这样的人怎能领导呢？”1950年，当大家都在欢乐地庆祝共产党生日的时候，刘积学却大骂“共产党是啥东西”。史锡荣说：有一次前中共河南省委书记张玺同志作报告，有人问“这是谁？”刘积学说：“还不是穷嘴呱?舌的张玺吗！”段若虹说，这很明显，刘积学是站在反动阶级的立场上反对共产党，辱骂共产党。
    段若虹继而揭发了刘积学企图推翻共产党领导的组织活动。他说：刘积学不仅解放前积极进行反共反人民的活动，就在解放初期刘积学担任民革河南组织召集人时，他认为那是聚集反共力量的好时机，在他的参谋长李静之、大将王友梅、宋聿修等的主谋策划下，大肆吸收反革命分子参加组织，企图把民革形成反共基地。其中包括早已被镇压的血债累累的反革命分子孙尚阳、王友梅在内。他还准备吸收郭筱白。郭筱白得知这个情况，随即去四川与新蔡县外逃匪首展俊甫、郭筱舫（伪三青团部主任）联系，他对这两个匪首说：“我将到开封工作，这可有机会了，我在那里活动，你们在外边活动，以后看机会里应外合”搞暴乱。前些时，刘积学和他的参谋长李静之，还企图降低条件来发展民革组织，把“三反”对象、“肃反”对象、被清洗的和对党仇恨分子，吸收到民革组织中来，以便扩大队伍作为和共产党对抗的政治资本；主张民革到小城市发展，及发展青年人。共产党开始整风，他们又共同策划到处搜集、歪曲和捏造事实，向共产党进攻。
    刘积学一贯抵触党和人民政府的政策，反对社会主义制度。段若虹说：在土地改革时，刘积学很不满意地说：“多少年来都是地主养活农民，要不然农民早就饿死了。”1954年刘积学还说：“土改时说地主剥削农民，这‘剥削’二字我就不通，自己干事挣来的钱，买地是合理合法的，那时佃户给地主种地还要感恩，不叫种地就要饿死，给地种是对他有恩。”还说：“所谓‘封建’地主，这句话也不通，‘封’是‘封疆’之封，‘建’是建邑之建，皇帝封某地给某人，赋税归他，这叫‘封建’，可是地主自己掏钱买地，谁封的他？谁建的他？要分地也可以，我主张和平分田，不必斗争。”由于刘积学反对土改，所以省里开的两次动员土改的重要会议，他都中途退席。段若虹说，刘积学对党和政府的统购统销政策，也是极力反对、大肆诬蔑。他曾说：“现在粮食统购统销，要饭就没处要，只有转个圈回去。”刘积学的反动立场、恶毒阴谋，还表现在他对社会主义制度的诬蔑。他曾说：“社会主义表面上看怪好，实际上问题不少。”又说：“社会主义走的太快了，农业合作化走的太快了！”看，刘积学说这话的目的，还不是煽动群众反对新社会，让地主、资产阶级复辟吗？
    刘积学对镇压反革命是非常不满的。他说：“我个人虽未受过过火的压迫，但是乡间革命非刑吊打、逼死人命、坐班房押起来是有的。”刘积学并把群众雄伟的革命行动诬蔑为“以暴易暴”。段若虹说：刘积学所代表的是他的亲朋厚友，如他的朋友陈贯群，是在保定枪杀过几十个学生的刽子手，而当他见到该犯被镇压的布告时，却表示很惋惜；还有，反革命分子郭筱白、段厚甫、梅子美、张建华和竹沟事件的刽子手王友梅等，都是刘积学的亲朋厚友，或得力的大将；刘积学的侄子刘残蕚、刘佩之，叔伯兄弟刘庆元等被镇压的恶霸地主、反革命分子，都是刘积学为之喊冤的，都是刘积学恶毒污蔑乡间革命过火的事实根据！
    发言者广泛地揭发了刘积学反共的罪恶历史。
    贺升平说：我和刘积学熟识的很早，我对他的认识也最清楚。刘积学从历史上就是坚决反对共产党的。他是国民党西山会议派的成员、又是当时国民党的中央委员。他们是以反共起家，以反共为他们的终身事业的。当孙中山先生坚决实行三大政策时，刘积学这一派便站出来反对。孙先生死后，他们更是明目张胆地公开地支持蒋介石对共产党人实行大屠杀，这就是历史上的“四一二”事件。像戴季陶、张继、谢持、邹鲁和刘积学等都是主张杀共产党人最坚决的人。贺升平气愤地指出：刘积学先后作国民党的立法委员和河南省的参议长二十年，他一举手就有无数的人头落地。刘积学所举的那只手，的确沾满了劳动人民、革命志士的鲜血。
    别光典说，解放前，刘积学在河南有许多爪牙，他们是最顽强的反共、反人民的集团。像郭仲隗和已被镇压的王友梅，都是这个集团的大将。他们长期以来，盘踞在河南的反动政治舞台上，压迫剥削人民，无恶不作，河南人民叫他们为“地头蛇”。刘积学就是这一伙伙的头子。这一伙人都听刘积学的话，在他的指示下，王友梅勾结宛西大恶霸别廷芳，在宛东一带也杀害了许多革命同志和革命群众；郭仲隗在刘河事件中也杀害了不少革命同志，这真是罪恶滔天。高仰源、房西华等揭发河南解放前夕，刘积学一手掌握制定“治安方案”，还吁请蒋介石派五个军常驻本省“清剿”，并要组织省防军三至五个师，集中使用；提出强制捐献粮款充“剿匪”经费；主张集中一切力量从事“剿匪”工作。开封解放前夕，刘积学还在信阳指示亲信组织散匪合力反共。
    座谈会中，许多人发言要求右派分子刘积学、李静之彻底交代其罪恶活动，否则将自绝于人民。
