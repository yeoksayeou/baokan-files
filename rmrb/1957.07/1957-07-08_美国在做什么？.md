What is the United States Doing?
		Gu Si

		The United States is Afraid
	The United States is stepping up its efforts to create tension around the world, hindering the relaxation of the international situation, in order to salvage its increasingly passive and unfavorable position and situation. This is an important feature of recent developments in the international situation.
	In the past period, the trend towards relaxation of the international situation was mainly reflected in the resumption of navigation on the Suez Canal, the possibility of reaching partial agreements on disarmament, and the relaxation of trade restrictions on China by many Western countries. These situations encouraged the people of all countries who love peace to make efforts to eliminate the threat of war and strive for lasting peace, and at the same time made the U.S. ruling clique feel panicked. Under pressure at home and abroad, the U.S. ruling group had to make some conciliatory gestures on its China policy and disarmament issues in order to gain the initiative. For example, on the China policy issue, Eisenhower once stated that he also believed that a complete embargo on China was unrealistic. On the issue of disarmament, the United States had expressed optimism about reaching a limited agreement. However, these conciliatory gestures by the United States had unexpected effects. Both inside and outside the United States, the call for a re-examination of China policy became even stronger. Many Western countries followed Britain in relaxing trade restrictions on China. The optimistic atmosphere on disarmament caused a drop in New York stocks and hesitation and contemplation among Western countries regarding accepting U.S. nuclear weapons. The U.S. ruling clique was therefore afraid. It quickly withdrew its conciliatory gestures and took a series of measures and actions to maintain and intensify the tense situation.

		Delaying Tactics on Disarmament
	On the disarmament issue, the United States is now backtracking, using a new delaying tactic. The Soviet Union's proposal on June 14 to suspend nuclear weapons testing within two or three years was welcomed and valued by people of all countries, putting the United States in a very passive position. Therefore, at the meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee on June 17, the United States and other Western countries had to express their welcome to the Soviet proposal and acknowledge that it was an important step towards reaching a partial disarmament agreement. U.S. representative Stassen also promised to put forward a U.S. plan "soon" in order to "accelerate" the reaching of an agreement.
	After making this wish, the Western countries planned to deal with the Soviet proposal. By June 20, Stassen stated that the United States insisted that the first step in a disarmament agreement must include provisions for stopping nuclear weapons testing and reducing troop levels. But he also said that the U.S. military could not be reduced to below 2.5 million men unless there was a simultaneous "improvement in the political situation." In this way, the United States created obstacles to reaching an agreement on the issue of reducing troop levels. In other words, the United States cannot disarm or stop nuclear weapons testing until complex international issues such as the German question and the Korean question are resolved.
	On June 25, Stassen put forward a so-called proposal to reduce the armed forces of major powers in three stages, repeating the opinions already mentioned above. It was not until July 2, under repeated urging from the Soviet Union, that the Western countries put forward a statement on the issue of stopping nuclear testing. This statement, on the one hand, acknowledged that a temporary cessation of nuclear testing was possible, but on the other hand, it attached many conditions to the cessation of testing. According to this statement, before stopping nuclear testing, a whole series of issues must first be resolved, such as how long to stop testing, when to conduct and install the necessary monitoring equipment, as well as initial cessation of arms growth, initial reduction of armed forces and designated armaments, and cessation of production of fissionable materials for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, etc. According to past experience, these issues can become subjects of endless debate. There are also major differences of opinion within Western countries on many issues, such as the duration of the cessation of testing and the cessation of production of fissionable materials, due to conflicting interests. Therefore, it is clear that the United States is using new delaying tactics to obstruct the reaching of a partial disarmament agreement and hinder the relaxation of the international situation.

		Creating Tension in Asia
	In Asia, the United States' activities in creating new tensions are particularly blatant. On June 21, the United States publicly announced that it would unilaterally abrogate paragraph 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement and transport new weapons into South Korea. This act by the United States, which violates the Korean Armistice Agreement, has been strongly protested by the Korean and Chinese sides and condemned by many Asian countries. Several U.S. Air Force squadrons with new aircraft are now conducting training in South Korea. Two divisions of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will be reorganized into units possessing atomic weapons. Under the encouragement of the United States, Syngman Rhee is clamoring to completely tear up the armistice agreement and unify Korea by force. In order to stop this act by the United States, which seriously endangers peace in Korea and Asia, the Korean and Chinese sides have proposed holding an international conference with the participation of relevant countries to discuss the situation caused by the U.S. action. But the United States is clearly unwilling to do so.
	In order to prevent the serious consequences caused in Asia by the relaxation of the "embargo" on China by Western European countries, the United States has strengthened its efforts to win over and control Asian countries that follow the United States. Through the Japan-U.S. talks, the United States has made the Kishi Nobusuke government undertake the obligation to accelerate rearmament and turn Japan into a U.S. naval and air force base. The United States has exerted strong pressure on Thailand to make it firmly follow the U.S. resolution. Dulles also made a speech hostile to the Chinese people on June 28, indicating that the United States is unwilling to change its unrealistic China policy, attempting to put pressure on those at home and abroad who demand a change in China policy. However, Dulles's speech has been widely ridiculed and criticized. This shows how unpopular the current U.S. policy is.

		Strengthening Subversive Activities in the Middle East
	In the Middle East, the United States is now consolidating its already acquired position, attempting to realize the so-called "Dulles Plan" proposed two years ago, which has been rejected by the relevant Arab countries. At the end of June, the United States announced that it would provide Jordan with another $10 million in military aid and $10 million in economic aid to strengthen the rule of King Hussein of Jordan. The plan to move Palestinian refugees west of the Jordan River to the Iraqi desert is also for this purpose. The United States is also preparing to turn the military bases of Mafraq and Aqaba, which Britain has just withdrawn from, into U.S. bases.
	From many indications, the next target of U.S. aggression is Syria. Jordanian Minister of Economy Hiri said not long ago that six Arab countries (excluding Egypt), including Syria, would consider organizing a regional development committee, which is said to have been first proposed by Jordan and Iraq. Clearly, the purpose of this plan is to attract the Syrian bourgeoisie to Western countries. In order to put pressure on Syria, Saudi Arabia is creating tension in its relations with Syria, attempting to squeeze Defense Minister Azem, who is firmly anti-imperialist, out of the government. Agence France-Presse reported from Beirut on July 1 that Azem, who had criticized Saudi Arabia's pro-Western behavior, may go to Europe for medical treatment. This reveals the thoughts of the imperialists. Israel's recent intensification of provocative activities on the Syrian border is clearly part of the imperialist conspiracy. However, the patriotic and nationalist forces within Syria are still very strong. Syrian newspapers have recently exposed the U.S. conspiracy to plan subversive activities and assassinate Syrian leaders in Syria, which shows that the Syrian people are fully vigilant.
	In order to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation, the United States is bound to create more tensions in various parts of the world. However, this action taken by the United States can only further expose its face as an enemy of peaceful people, thus placing it in a more isolated position.

    美国在做什么？
    顾思
              美国害怕了
    美国正在全世界加紧制造紧张局势，阻挠国际局势的缓和，以挽回它愈来愈被动和不利的地位和处境。这是最近国际时局发展中的一个重要特点。
    在过去一个时期中，国际局势的走向缓和，主要表现在苏伊士运河通航的恢复、裁军问题上出现的达成局部协议的可能性，和许多西方国家放宽对中国的贸易限制。这些情况鼓舞了各国爱好和平的人民为消除战争威胁、争取持久和平而作的努力，同时也使美国统治集团感到惊慌。美国统治集团在国内外的压力下，为了争取主动，曾经不得不在对华政策和裁军问题上做出一些和缓的姿态。例如，在对华政策问题上，艾森豪威尔曾经表示他也认为对中国实行完全禁运是不现实的。在裁军问题上，美国对于达成有限度的协议曾经表示乐观。但是，美国的这些和缓姿态，发生了出乎它意料之外的效果。在美国国内外，要求重新审查对华政策的呼声更加强烈了。许多西方国家追随英国之后放宽了对华贸易的限制。而裁军方面的乐观空气，引起了纽约股票的跌价，和西方国家对于接受美国核子武器的观望和犹豫。美国统治集团因此害怕了。它赶紧收起它的缓和姿态，采取了一系列保持和加剧紧张局势的措施和行动。
                    在裁军问题上的拖延战术
    在裁军问题上，美国现在正在打退堂鼓，使用了一种新的拖延战术。苏联在6月14日提出的在两三年内停止核武器试验的建议，受到了各国人民的欢迎和重视，使美国十分被动。因此，在6月17日的联合国裁军小组委员会会议上，美国和其他西方国家只好表示欢迎苏联的建议，并且承认这是达成局部裁军协议的一个重要步骤。美国代表史塔生还答应“很快”提出美国方案，以求“加速”达成协定。
    在许下这个心愿以后，西方国家就计议对付苏联的建议。到6月20日，史塔生表示，美国主张第一步裁军协议必须包括停止核武器试验和削减军队水平的条款在内。但是他又说，美国军队不能减少到二百五十万人以下，除非同时使“政治局势有所改善”。这样美国就给在削减军队水平问题上达成协议布下了障碍。换句话说，在德国问题、朝鲜问题这些复杂的国际问题没有解决以前，美国不能裁军，也不能停止核武器试验。
    6月25日，史塔生又提出了一个所谓分三个阶段削减大国武装部队的建议，重复了前面已经提到过的意见。一直到7月2日，在苏联一再催促之下，西方国家才提出了一个关于停止核试验问题的声明。这个声明一方面承认暂时停止核试验是可能的，但是另一方面却给停止试验加上了许多条件。按照这个声明，在停止核试验以前，先要解决一大串问题，像停止试验多久、在什么时候进行和装置必要的监督设备，以及初步停止军备增长、初步减少武装部队和指定的军备、停止生产用于制造核武器的裂变物质等等。而按照过去的经验，这些问题可以成为无休止的争论题目。有许多问题，像停止试验的期限和停止生产裂变物质等问题，在西方国家内部，由于利害冲突的关系，意见也有很大分歧。因此，很明显，美国是在使用新的拖延战术，来阻挠局部裁军协议的达成，阻挠国际局势的缓和。
                      在亚洲制造紧张局势
    在亚洲方面，美国制造新的紧张局势的活动特别露骨。6月21日，美国方面公然宣布要片面废除朝鲜停战协定第十三条卯项，向南朝鲜运入新式武器。美国这个破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为，遭到朝中方面的强烈抗议，也受到许多亚洲国家的谴责。现在美国的几个拥有新式飞机的空军中队，已在南朝鲜进行训练。驻在南朝鲜的两师美国军队，将改编为拥有原子武器的部队。在美国的鼓励之下，李承晚大肆叫嚣要全面撕毁停战协定，武力统一朝鲜。为了制止美国这个严重地危害朝鲜和亚洲和平的行为，朝中方面已经建议举行有关国家参加的国际会议，来讨论美国行动所引起的局势。但是美国显然不愿意这样做。
    为了防止由于西欧国家放宽对华“禁运”而在亚洲引起的严重后果，美国加强了对追随美国的亚洲国家的拉拢和控制。美国通过日美会谈，使得岸信介政府承担了加紧重新武装、变日本为美国海、空军基地的义务。美国对泰国施加了强大的压力，要它坚定追随美国的决心。杜勒斯还特地在6月28日发表了一篇敌视中国人民的演说，表明美国不愿改变不现实的对华政策，企图对国内外那些要求改变对华政策的人施加压力。但是，杜勒斯的演说普遍地遭到了嘲笑和抨击。这说明美国的现行政策是多么不得人心。
                      在中东加强颠覆活动
    在中东方面，美国现在正在巩固自己已经取得的地位，企图实现两年前提出的、已遭到有关的阿拉伯国家所拒绝的所谓“杜勒斯方案”。美国在6月底宣布再给予约旦一千万美元军事援助和一千万美元经济援助，以加强约旦国王侯赛因的统治。把约旦河以西的巴勒斯坦难民迁移到伊拉克沙漠中去的计划，也是为了这个目的。美国还准备把英国刚刚撤出的麦法拉克和亚喀巴等军事基地变成美国的基地。
    从许多迹象看来，美国的下一个侵略目标是叙利亚。约旦经济大臣赫里不久以前说，包括叙利亚在内的六个阿拉伯国家（不包括埃及）将考虑组织一个区域发展委员会，据说这是约旦和伊拉克首先提出来的。显然，这个计划的目的是吸引叙利亚的资产阶级倾向西方国家。为了对叙利亚施加压力，沙特阿拉伯在同叙利亚的关系上制造紧张，企图把坚决反帝国主义的国防部长阿泽姆排挤出政府。法新社7月1日从贝鲁特报道说，曾经抨击沙特阿拉伯的亲西方行为的阿泽姆可能去欧洲养病。这透露了帝国主义者们的心思。而以色列最近在叙利亚边境上加紧进行挑衅活动，显然是帝国主义的阴谋的一部分。但是，叙利亚国内的爱国的民族主义的力量仍然是很强大的。叙利亚报纸最近揭露了美国在叙利亚策划颠覆活动和暗杀叙利亚领袖的阴谋，这说明叙利亚人民是有着充分的警惕的。
    为了阻挠国际局势的缓和，美国势必还要在世界各地更多地制造紧张局势。但是，美国所采取的这种行动，只能使它的与和平人民为敌的面目更加暴露，因而处于更加孤立的地位。
