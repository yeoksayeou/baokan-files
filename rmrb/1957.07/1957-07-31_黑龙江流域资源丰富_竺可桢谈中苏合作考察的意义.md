Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 30th: Zhu Kezhen, the Chinese leader of the Sino-Soviet Heilongjiang Comprehensive Survey Team and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, issued a written statement in Harbin on the 27th, discussing the significance of the Heilongjiang River Basin comprehensive survey. Zhu Kezhen said: The Heilongjiang River Basin comprehensive survey has a relatively wide scope, including hydropower, hydrology, geology, natural conditions, transportation, and other items. Certain achievements were already obtained in 1956, and it will continue for another two or three years. This survey paid particular attention to the comprehensive utilization of hydropower resources in the upper and middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River. The upper and middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River have huge hydropower resources. If used for power generation, the installed capacity on the shared Sino-Soviet section alone would reach 6 million kilowatts.

Zhu Kezhen said: Building reservoirs on the main streams and tributaries of the Heilongjiang River will not only supply both countries with abundant, inexpensive, and urgently needed electricity, but will also play a significant role in flood control, irrigation, and land reclamation.

Zhu Kezhen said: In terms of geological surveys, the Soviet Union has discovered huge iron ore reserves on the left bank of the Ergun River, a tributary of the Heilongjiang River, but lacks coking coal nearby. Iron and manganese ore have also been discovered in the Soviet region on the left bank of the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River, but it also lacks coking coal. In our country, which is adjacent to the Soviet Union, mineral deposits have not yet been well explored. Based on the geological structure system, there is a good hope of discovering iron and manganese ore in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Ranges, while the coal in the Hegang and Shuangyashan areas is suitable for coking. How to utilize the ferrous metals, coke, and hydropower resources in this region requires the cooperation and efforts of Chinese and Soviet scientists.

In terms of transportation, the annual freight volume between China and the Soviet Union is increasing, and water transportation is cheaper than land transportation. Currently, the waterway for freight transport between the Soviet Far East and our country must pass through the Heilongjiang River and the Tatar Strait, which is not only a long distance, but also inconvenient for transportation due to ice封 for six months of the year. At the suggestion of our country, it is planned to open the Songliao Canal in the future, so that freight transport between the two can go upstream along the Songhua River, through the Liao River, and reach the Bohai Sea, with water transport possible for almost ten months of the year.

    黑龙江流域资源丰富
    竺可桢谈中苏合作考察的意义
    据新华社哈尔滨30日电　中苏黑龙江综合考察队中方领导人、中国科学院副院长竺可桢，27日在哈尔滨发表书面谈话，论述黑龙江流域综合考察的意义。竺可桢说：黑龙江流域的综合考察，范围较为广泛，包括水能、水文、地质、自然条件、交通运输等项，在1956年已获得一定成果，今后还将继续进行两三年。这次考察特别注意了黑龙江上游及中游的水能资源的综合利用问题。黑龙江上游及中游有巨大的水能资源，用以发电，仅在中苏共有的河段上，装机容量即达六百万瓩之多。
    竺可桢说：在黑龙江干支流上建筑水库，不仅将供应两国以丰富廉价与迫切需要的电力，在防洪、灌溉、垦荒方面也将发生重大作用。
    竺可桢说：地质调查方面，黑龙江支流额尔古纳河左岸，苏联已发现储量巨大的铁矿，但附近缺乏焦煤。黑龙江中游左岸苏联地区，也发现了铁矿和锰矿，但也缺乏焦煤。和苏联毗邻的我国境内，矿藏尚未很好勘察，根据地质构造体系而论，很有在大、小兴安岭区域发现铁矿和锰矿的希望，而鹤岗、双鸭山一带的煤都适用于炼焦。如何利用这一区域的黑色金属和焦炭及水能资源，尚待中苏科学家的合作与努力。
    在交通运输方面，中苏两国货运年有增加，水运较陆运价钱为廉。目前从苏联远东和我国货运来往水路须经黑龙江和鞑靼海峡，不但路途遥远，而一年中有六个月冰封不便运输。经我国提议将来拟开辟松辽运河，两者间货运可由松花江上溯经辽河而至渤海，全年几乎有十个月可通水运。
