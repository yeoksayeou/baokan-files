Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th: Jiangsu Province is providing free injections to more than two million pigs belonging to agricultural cooperatives to prevent swine fever and swine erysipelas. This work is now half completed. In Lianshui, Muyang and other counties where swine fever and swine erysipelas commonly occur, no cases have been reported since the preventive injections.

Before liberation, swine fever and swine erysipelas were prevalent in Jiangsu Province, and the mortality rate of pigs was very high. Since liberation, the government has carried out preventive injections every year, and the phenomenon of infectious death of pigs has gradually decreased. In 1951, the mortality rate of swine fever and swine erysipelas was 3.6%, which dropped to 1.9% in 1956. Due to continuous preventive injections every year, no pig in the Anti-Kiln Agricultural Cooperative in Hai'an County has died of infectious diseases in the past five years.

The government's vigorous development of pig disease prevention work has powerfully encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for pig raising. In 1956, there were only more than 5.01 million pigs in the province. According to statistics at the end of March this year, there are nearly 8 million, and it is expected to reach 10 million by the end of this year.

    江苏免费预防猪疫
    据新华社南京4日电　江苏省预防猪瘟、猪胆毒，为农业社的二百多万头猪进行免费注射，现在这一工作已完成二分之一。惯常发生猪瘟，猪胆毒的涟水、沐阳等县经预防注射后，至今未见发病。
    江苏省解放前猪瘟、猪胆毒流行，猪的死亡率很高。解放后政府历年来都进行了预防注射，猪病传染死亡现象逐年减少。1951年猪瘟、猪胆毒死亡率是3.6％，到1956年下降到1.9％。海安县抗窑农业社由于每年不断的进行预防注射，五年来没有一头生猪死于传染病。
    政府大力开展预防猪病工作，有力地鼓舞了农民养猪的积极性。1956年全省只有五百零一万多头猪，今年3月底统计已近八百万头，预计到今年底可达到一千万头。
