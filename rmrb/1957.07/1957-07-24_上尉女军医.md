    Captain Female Military Doctor
    Hu Wentao
    She crossed the flames of war
    From the Greater Khingan Mountains to Hainan Island
    She carries the honor of a soldier
    From a girl to a Captain Military Doctor
    Braving wind and snow to wash bandages
    The Mudanjiang River remembers her face
    Carrying stretchers to climb mountains
    Her footprints are left on the Dabie Mountains
    A kerosene lamp lights up in a thatched cottage
    Guarding sick and wounded comrades in the deep of night
    Gentle words warmed many brothers
    She even used her own blood to save them
    She followed the red flag of the revolution
    Traversing thousands of mountains and rivers
    On the battlefield of liberation
    Step by step towards victory
    Now she is defending the motherland on the border
    Working day and night without a sound
    Three gold stars are worn on her shoulders
    A smiling blush often appears on her cheeks…

    上尉女军医
    胡问涛
    她穿过战争的烽火
    从兴安岭来到海南岛
    她带着战士的荣誉
    从少女变成上尉军医
    冒着风雪洗涤绷带
    牡丹江水记得她的面影
    抬着担架翻山越岭
    大别山上留下她的脚印
    茅草房里点着一盏油灯
    深夜里守护伤病的同志
    轻柔的话语温暖了多少个弟兄
    也曾用自己的鲜血救活他们
    她跟随革命的红旗
    跨越千山万水
    在解放战场上
    一步一步走向胜利
    如今她又在边疆保卫祖国
    日夜工作而不作声
    三颗金星戴在肩上
    面颊常现微笑的红晕……
