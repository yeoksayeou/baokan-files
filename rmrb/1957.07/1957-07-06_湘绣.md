    Hunan embroidery, or "Xiang Embroidery," uses glossy silk to create richly colored embroidered products based on paintings and through dense stitching. It uses two types of thread: scattered color silk and silk thread. Scattered color silk embroidery is used for artistic decorations, and is extremely delicate. Silk thread embroidery is used for daily necessities, and is resistant to abrasion. It has more than twenty kinds of needlework techniques. For example, to embroider flower leaves, the "squeezing needle" technique is used to create the main veins on the front of the leaf, making the veins appear to be contained within the leaf. The "rolling needle" technique is used to create the veins on the back of the leaf, making the veins appear to protrude from the leaf surface. Another example is embroidering bird feathers, using the "wandering needle" technique, making it appear as if real feathers are growing on the bird's body. Embroiderers can adapt to the painting and apply various different needlework techniques.

    Xiang Embroidery has only had a history of just over sixty years as a commodity with centralized production. Previously, it was all family handicraft, passed down from mother to daughter and elder sister to younger sister, mainly used to decorate children's clothes, wallets, tobacco pouches, eyeglass cases, pillows, etc. Since it became a commodity, it gradually imitated Western color prints to cater to the needs of the market at that time, and most of it was very vulgar.

    After liberation, Xiang Embroidery artisans organized and established production cooperatives, and relevant departments frequently provided care and assistance. The skills of painters and embroiderers have improved day by day. Through exhibitions and foreign orders, Xiang Embroidery has gained a high reputation at home and abroad.

    Currently, there are more than 40,000 embroiderers in the three areas of Changsha City and Changsha and Wangcheng counties, most of whom are engaged in rural sideline production, dispersed production. However, all cooperatives are organizing study to improve skills and increase production to meet domestic and foreign needs. (Attached picture)

    湘绣
    李昌鄂
    湖南的“湘绣”，是根据画稿，利用发亮的蚕丝，通过细密的刺绣，来制成色彩丰富的绣品。它的用线，分散色丝和丝线两种。散色丝绣的用来做艺术装饰品，精细无比；丝线绣的用做日用品，能耐磨擦。它有二十多种针法，例如绣花叶，用挤针子做正面叶筋，筋好像含在叶子内；用滚针子做反面叶筋，筋好像凸出叶面。又如绣鸟的羽毛，用游针子做，就像真毛生在鸟身上一样。绣工们能适应画稿，应用各种不同的针法。
    湘绣成为商品，集中生产，只有六十多年的历史，以前都是家庭手工，母教女、姐教妹的传授，主要用来装饰儿童的衣服和钱包、烟袋、眼镜盒、枕头等等。自从它成为商品以后，由于迎合当时市场的需要，逐渐模仿西洋彩色画片，多数很庸俗。
    解放后，湘绣艺人组织建立了生产合作社，有关方面经常给予关怀帮助，画工绣工的技术日益提高，通过展览和国外定货，湘绣在国内外获得了很高的评价。
    现在长沙市和长沙、望城两县三个地区，共有绣工四万多人，大部分是农村副业，分散生产。但各合作社都在组织学习，提高技术，增加产量，以满足国内外的需要。（附图片）
