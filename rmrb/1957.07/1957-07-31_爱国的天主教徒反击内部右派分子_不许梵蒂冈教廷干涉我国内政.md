Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Like other bourgeois rightists in society, rightist elements within the Chinese Catholic Church have been secretly colluding and spreading old anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist rhetoric, taking advantage of the recent preparatory meeting for the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference. They attacked the patriotic anti-imperialist movement of Catholics and openly defended the Vatican's reactionary policies and various crimes of interfering in our internal affairs. These reactionary statements and actions by the rightists have been resolutely refuted by patriotic Catholics, and the rightists are now isolated.

After criticizing the rightists, Catholics proposed to resolutely draw a clear line between ourselves and the Vatican politically, sever political and economic ties, and run the Chinese Catholic Church well on the basis of patriotism and love for the Church.

This preparatory meeting lasted for twenty-seven days from June 17th to July 13th. 241 people participated in the meeting, including archbishops, bishops, priests, and lay Catholics from more than 100 dioceses across the country.

Shapeless and Colored Rightist Fallacies Within the Church Attempt to Defend the Vatican's Reactionary Face

In the early stages of the preparatory meeting, when the vast majority of representatives proposed to draw a clear political line with the Vatican, Wang Wencheng, the Bishop of Nanchong Diocese in Sichuan Province, opposed the representatives' exposure of the Vatican's reactionary political face, saying that this was "digging up the roots of the Catholic Church's life." Regarding the clergy who had been punished by the Vatican for participating in the patriotic anti-imperialist movement and visiting the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, he said, "If there is punishment, there is effect," and that they should "obey unconditionally."

Zhao Zhensheng, Bishop of Xianxian Diocese in Hebei Province, openly stated that Catholics "love the Church means love the country," that "taking the socialist road should be voluntary," and that "establishing a patriotic association requires Vatican approval." Zhao Zhensheng even described the Vatican, which has consistently been hostile to the new China, as "loving China" and its policy of politically following U.S. imperialism as "opposing imperialism and defending world peace."

During the discussion, many representatives believed that although Catholics and the Communist Party had different worldviews, they were united in politically loving the motherland and building a prosperous and happy socialist country. However, Wang Keqian, a priest from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, sowed discord between Catholics and the Communist Party, saying: "Catholicism advocates private ownership, which is human nature. The Communist Party's leadership of socialism is the abolition of private ownership." He emphasized that this was a "fundamental problem," actually indicating that he could not support socialism.

Wei Baoshan, a priest from Beijing, cited the Church's "Code of Canon Law" to defend the heinous imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, opposing Catholics exposing and denouncing their crimes. He also threatened: "Even if the Catholics know of their crimes, they cannot expose and denounce them to the government, otherwise they will have committed a great sin and should be excommunicated by the Church."

Zhu Kongjia, a Catholic from Shanghai, also openly defended Gong Pinmei and other counter-revolutionaries, saying: "Bishop Gong did not allow Catholics to participate in land reform, did not allow Catholics to participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, and did not allow Catholics to get close to the government in order to protect Catholics from the influence of atheism. His motives and stance were good. If the government does not release them, how can it unite with the Catholic Church?" He emphasized that "unity is the key."

The representatives conducted in-depth discussions on issues such as whether it was a sin for clergy and Catholics to participate in patriotic activities, whether the Vatican's punishment of patriotic Chinese clergy was valid, and whether it should be accepted. About 170 or 180 representatives expressed their opinions. They unanimously pointed out that patriotism is a righteous act, not only without sin but also meritorious. They resolutely condemned the Vatican's unreasonable expulsion of patriotic Chinese clergy from the Church, believing that this was essentially interference in our internal affairs. Everyone firmly stated that they would ignore such actions by the Vatican.

Patriotic Catholics Must Stand Firm and Refuse to Accept the Vatican's Orders That Are Essentially Opposed to Socialism

During the discussion, the representatives reached a consensus on the following issues, saying that the Vatican serves U.S. imperialism and the capitalist world, and it is hostile to the socialist system. Therefore, we must distinguish between political and religious orders from the Vatican. We cannot accept those orders that appear in religious form but are actually opposed to socialism. They also cited church rules and doctrines to explain that the Vatican's sanctions against patriotic clergy should be ignored. They said: "There is no punishment without sin. The purpose of punishment is to punish evil and promote good. Patriotism is a virtue and should not be punished." They also said: "Church punishment is limited to the religious sphere. The Vatican has no right to interfere in the political activities of Chinese Catholics, and even if it does, it is invalid."

Yang Shida, Vice Director of the Shanghai Catholic Patriotic Association and Vice President of Shanghai Second Medical College, said that we oppose the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries within the Catholic Church and oppose the Vatican's political hostility towards new China. He said that patriotism is a sacred duty, and we cannot say that because the Vatican opposes our country, we will not fulfill our sacred duty. We must oppose anyone who opposes our country. Nor can we say that because the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries who oppose our country are Catholics, we cannot oppose them. He said that the Vatican has its political stance. Politically, it follows U.S. imperialism. It recognizes Taiwan and is hostile to new China. We have every reason to oppose this stance. The imperialists and counter-revolutionaries within the Catholic Church are plotting to sabotage new China, and our opposition to them is also a righteous act.

Yang Shida also said that patriotism is a political matter and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the "Code of Canon Law" at all. The "Code of Canon Law" itself cannot restrain and interfere in our patriotic movement at all. Therefore, the issue is not whether a certain article of the "Code of Canon Law" is suitable or not, but that it is completely irrelevant to the "Code of Canon Law."

Finally, Yang Shida said, should we accept the divine punishment for patriotism? Our answer is: resolutely not.

The representatives also unanimously condemned the Vatican's activities of colluding with the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist countries before World War II, and then colluding with U.S. imperialism after World War II, consistently opposing the Soviet Union, communism, and people's democratic countries.

Sun Chifang, Director of the Nanjing Catholic Patriotic Association, said that before the national liberation, Archbishop Libeli, the Vatican's envoy to the Chiang Kai-shek government, represented the Vatican and actively incited and organized Catholics to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. After the national liberation, Libeli sent Italian missionary Madi Nuo, who served as a spy for the U.S. government's intelligence agency, as his representative in Beijing. Madi Nuo used his religious profession as a cover in Beijing to carry out counter-revolutionary espionage activities, collecting a lot of military intelligence for Libeli. Libeli also issued orders and instructions to the Chinese Catholic Church to be hostile to the People's Government, prohibiting Chinese Catholics from participating in patriotic movements, forbidding the reading of books and newspapers published by the Communist Party, and threatening some patriotic and law-abiding bishops, priests, and Catholics in the Catholic Church with means such as "deprivation of divine power" and "excommunication."

Taking the Socialist Road is the Direction for Catholics to Love the Country and the Church

At the meeting, ten bishops, four papal administrators, fifty-eight acting bishops, vicars general, eighty-one priests, and eighty-four Catholics also exposed the crimes of foreign missionaries who had been hiding in Beijing after the national liberation, such as Ruigao Ni in Beijing, Ford in Guangdong, O'Kelan in Hunan, Zhai Guanghua, Cai Ermeng, and Tian Wanglin in Shanghai, as well as Mei Zhanyuan, Lang Shuwang, Dai Ande, and others from the Vincentian Congregation who were carrying out conspiracies of sabotage under the guise of religion.

Some rightist elements once said, "Catholics do not meddle in politics. Whether it is President Chiang's regime or Chairman Mao's regime, as long as religious freedom is protected, we will support them." The representatives resolutely refuted this fallacy. Yang Hong, Director of the Nanchang Catholic Patriotic Association, based on historical facts, explained that no government or political party has truly implemented the policy of religious freedom like the Communist Party. He said that we have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels, and we have ample opportunity to state our opinions and reflect problems. The People's Government has always adopted a policy of protection towards religion and has established specialized institutions to handle and resolve religious affairs. However, during the Kuomintang period, there were frequent incidents of humiliation of clergy and Catholics. Taking the Fengcheng County Catholic Church in our Nanchang Diocese as an example, a Kuomintang military officer set fire to and destroyed the property of the Catholic Church and closed the church because he failed to rape a Catholic female teacher, causing most Catholics to dare not enter the church since then. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, clergy in our Nanchang Diocese were killed by Japanese invaders, and many churches and houses were burned down. How can we say that we can be led by any political party or government?

Therefore, the representatives emphasized in their speeches that Catholics love the country, not the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, but the socialist new China led by the Communist Party, because the new China has done a very good job in political and economic construction, the social morality and customs have also been completely renewed, and the freedom of religious belief is protected by the People's Government. All of this is worth our love. They also said that only socialism can truly realize the elimination of exploitation and poverty and promote the improvement of people's material and cultural life. Only socialism can eliminate criminal phenomena and establish a good social moral atmosphere. These are completely consistent with the spirit advocated by the Catholic Church. Therefore, taking the socialist road is the direction for our three million Catholics to love the country and the Church.

The Gong Pinmei Reactionary Clique's Activities Go Beyond the Religious Sphere

Carrying Out the Anti-Reactionary Campaign Within the Catholic Church is Absolutely Necessary

Many representatives also used specific facts in their speeches to illustrate that carrying out the anti-reactionary campaign within the Catholic Church is absolutely necessary, refuting the fallacy of the rightist elements that "carrying out the anti-reactionary campaign within the Catholic Church is an excuse to attack the Church." Zhang Jizhong, a priest from Tianjin, introduced to the conference the facts he saw while personally participating in the inspection work of the anti-reactionary campaign in Tianjin, saying that during the inspection, I focused on inspecting the counter-revolutionary cases related to Catholics, and the facts proved that they had all committed great crimes. For example, Priest Liu Yimin once organized the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps." On the eve of Tianjin's liberation, he led reactionary troops to stubbornly resist the People's Liberation Army. However, the government still gave lenient treatment to such counter-revolutionaries, allowing him to recite the "Daily Lessons" on time every day in prison.

Gu Meiqing, a Catholic from Shanghai, listed Gong Pinmei's counter-revolutionary crimes in Shanghai in response to Zhu Kongjia's fallacy, saying: "The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique has long existed. After Shanghai's liberation, they actually obeyed imperialism and carried out various conspiracies hostile to the People's Government and the socialist cause. The activities of this reactionary clique completely exceeded the religious sphere and violated the national constitution. It is a thorough anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist clique."

After everyone presented the facts, reasoned, and debated repeatedly, Wang Wencheng, Zhao Zhensheng, Wei Baoshan, Zhu Kongjia, Wang Keqian, and others were at a loss for words and admitted that their positions and views were wrong and unfounded under very isolated circumstances. They also agreed with the opinions of other representatives, stating that Chinese Catholics must truly realize the sacred duty of loving the country and the Church, take the socialist road, support the leadership of the Communist Party, and sever political and economic relations with the Vatican. The Chinese Catholic Church must be run by Chinese Catholics themselves, and the Vatican must not arbitrarily interfere.

During the debate, many bishops, acting bishops, priests, and Catholics proposed: "All encyclicals, orders, etc. from the Vatican must be analyzed and cannot be blindly obeyed." They also said: "For the benefit of the Chinese people and the future of the Church, Chinese Catholics must strengthen unity on the basis of patriotism and love for the Church and run their own church well." They also put forward specific opinions on the issue of Chinese Catholics running their own church.

### 爱国的天主教徒反击内部右派分子  不许梵蒂冈教廷干涉我国内政

    爱国的天主教徒反击内部右派分子
    不许梵蒂冈教廷干涉我国内政
    据新华社30日讯　中国天主教内的右派分子，同社会上其他资产阶级右派分子一样，利用最近举行的中国天主教代表会议预备会的机会，秘密串连，散布反共反人民反社会主义的老调。他们攻击天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，公开为梵蒂冈的反动政策和干涉我国内政的种种罪行辩护。右派分子的这种反动的言论和行动，遭到了爱国的天主教徒的坚决驳斥，右派分子现在已经陷于孤立。
    经过对右派分子的批判，教徒们提出要坚决和梵蒂冈划清政治上的敌我界限，割断政治上和经济上的联系，在爱国爱教一致的基础上办好中国天主教会。
    这次预备会从6月17日开始到7月13日共进行了二十七天。参加这个会议的，有来自全国一百多个教区的总主教、主教、神甫和教徒等二百四十一人。
    教会内部形形色色的右派谬论  妄图为梵蒂冈反动面目辩护
    在预备会议初期，当绝大多数代表提出要和梵蒂冈划清政治界限的时候，四川省南充教区主教王文成反对代表们揭露梵蒂冈的反动政治面目，说这是“挖天主教会的命根根”。对于因参加反帝爱国运动和赴朝鲜慰问中国人民志愿军而遭到梵蒂冈处罚的神职人员，他说“有罚就有效”，要“无条件服从”。
    河北省献县教区主教赵振声公开提出教徒“爱教就是爱国”，“走社会主义道路要自愿”，“成立爱国会要经梵蒂冈批准”。赵振声甚至把一贯敌视新中国的梵蒂冈说成是“爱中国的”，把它在政治上热心追随美帝国主义的政策说成是“反对帝国主义的，是保卫世界和平的”。
    在讨论中间，许多代表认为天主教徒与共产党的宇宙观不同，但在政治上热爱祖国和建设繁荣幸福的社会主义国家却是一致的。然而，浙江省杭州神甫王克谦却挑拨教徒和共产党的关系，他说：“天主教主张私有制，这是人的秉性，共产党领导社会主义是取消私有制的”，他强调这是个“根本问题”，实际上是表示不能拥护社会主义。
    北京神甫尉宝山引用教会“法典”为罪恶多端的帝国主义分子和反革命分子辩护，反对教徒揭露和控诉他们的罪行。并且威胁说：“即令教友们知道他们的罪行，也不能向政府揭发和控诉，否则就是犯了大罪，应当受教会的绝罚”。
    上海教徒朱孔嘉还公开为龚品梅等反革命分子辩护说：“龚主教不让教友参加土地改革，不让教友参加抗美援朝，不让教友靠近政府，是为了使教友不受无神论的影响，其动机和立场都是好的，政府若不释放他们，如何能搞好和天主教会的团结呢？”他强调“要团结这就是关键”。
    代表们就神职人员和教徒参加爱国活动是否有罪，梵蒂冈处罚爱国的中国神职人员是否有效，以及应不应该接受等问题，进行了深入的讨论。约有一百七八十位代表发表了意见。他们一致指出，爱国是正义行为，不仅无罪，而且有功。他们坚决斥责梵蒂冈无理开除爱国的中国神职人员教籍的作法，认为这实质上是干涉我国内政。大家坚决表示，对梵蒂冈这种作法一概置之不理。
    爱国的教徒要站稳立场，拒绝接受梵蒂冈的实质上是反对社会主义的命令
    在讨论中，代表们对下列问题取得了一致的看法，他们说，梵蒂冈是为美帝国主义和资本主义世界服务的，它仇视社会主义制度，因此对来自梵蒂冈的命令我们要分清是政治的，还是宗教的，对以宗教形式出现而实际上是反对社会主义的那些命令，我们不能接受。他们还引用教规教义说明对梵蒂冈打击爱国神职人员的处分应置之不理。他们说：“无罪没有罚。罚的目的是惩恶扬善，爱国是美德就不应受罚。”他们还说：“教会处罚只限于宗教范围，中国天主教徒政治上的活动，梵蒂冈无权过问，即使处分了也是无效的。”
    上海天主教友爱国会副主任、上海第二医学院副院长杨士达说，我们反对在天主教内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子，反对梵蒂冈在政治上敌视新中国。他说，爱国是天职，不能说因为梵蒂冈反对我们的国家，我们就不尽天职了。任何人反对我们的国家，我们都要反对。也不能说因为反对我们国家的帝国主义分子和反革命分子是天主教徒，我们就不能反对他们了。他说，梵蒂冈有他的政治立场，在政治上它是跟美帝国主义走的，它承认台湾，敌视新中国，我们反对它的这种立场，是完全有理由的。天主教内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子是阴谋破坏新中国的，我们反对他们，也正是一种正义的行动。
    杨士达又说，爱国是政治上的事情，根本不属于“法典”管辖的范围，“法典”本身根本不能约束和干涉我们的爱国运动。因此，在这个问题上，不是“法典”那条适合不适合，而是与“法典”根本无关。
    最后，杨士达说，因爱国而受到神权上的处分，应该不应该接受呢？我们的回答是：坚决不接受。
    代表们还一致斥责了梵蒂冈在第二次世界大战前勾结德、意、日法西斯国家，第二次世界大战后，又勾结美帝国主义，一贯地反苏反共反对人民民主国家的活动。
    南京市天主教友爱国会主任孙持方说，全国解放前，梵蒂冈驻蒋介石政府的公使黎培里代表梵蒂冈教廷，积极煽动和组织教友支持蒋介石的反人民内战。全国解放以后，黎培里派遣为美国政府间谍机关服务的意大利籍传教士马迪懦作他的驻北京代表。马迪懦在北京以宗教职业为掩护，进行反革命间谍活动，为黎培里搜集了许多军事情报。黎培里并数次向中国天主教会发布敌视人民政府的命令和指示，不准中国天主教徒参加爱国运动，不许阅读共产党出版的书籍和报刊，并以“摘神权”、“开除教籍”等手段，威胁天主教中的一些有爱国心的守法的主教、神甫和教徒。
    走社会主义道路，是教徒爱国爱教的方向
    会上，十名主教、四名宗座总理、五十八名代理主教、副主教、八十一名神甫和八十四名教徒还揭发了在全国解放后隐藏在北京的芮歌尼、广东的福尔德、湖南的欧克澜、上海的翟光华、才尔孟、田望霖，以及隐藏在遣使会的梅占元、郎树望、戴安德等外国传教士披着宗教外衣进行阴谋破坏活动的罪行。
    有的右派分子曾说，“天主教人不过问政治，不管蒋大总统政权也好，毛主席政权也好，只要保护宗教自由，我们都拥护”。代表们坚决驳斥了这种谬论。南昌市天主教友爱国会主任杨泓根据历史事实，说明没有一个政府和党派像共产党这样真正的执行着宗教信仰自由的政策。他说，各级人民代表大会都有我们的代表，我们有充分的机会来陈述自己的意见，反映问题。人民政府对宗教一贯采取了保护政策，并且设立了专门处理和解决宗教事务的机构。可是在国民党时期，神职人员和教友受污辱的事却时有所闻。就以我们南昌教区丰城县天主堂为例，国民党军官因强占天主教女教员未遂，便放火烧毁天主堂财产，封闭教堂，使大多数教友从此不敢进教堂。在抗日战争时期，我们南昌教区神职人员遭日寇杀害，许多栋教堂及房屋被焚毁，这怎么能说什么党派或什么政府领导我们都可以呢？
    因此，代表们在发言都强调说，天主教徒爱国，不是爱蒋介石反动集团，而是爱共产党领导的社会主义的新中国，因为新中国，在政治经济建设方面搞得非常好，社会道德风尚也焕然一新，宗教信仰的自由受到人民政府的保护，这一切都值得我们热爱。他们还说：因为只有社会主义才能真正实现消灭剥削和贫困，促使人民物质文化生活的提高，只有社会主义才能消灭罪恶现象，树立良好的社会道德风气，这些和天主教圣教会教义主张的精神是完全一致的。因此，走社会主义的道路，就是我们三百万教徒爱国爱教的方向。
    龚品梅反动集团活动超出宗教范围
    在天主教会内进行肃反是完全必要的
    不少代表在讲话中，还用具体事实说明在天主教内进行肃反是完全必要的，驳斥了右派分子所说的“在天主教内进行肃反是借题发挥，打击教会”的谬论。天津神甫张济众以亲身参加天津市肃反视察工作中所看到的事实向大会介绍说，在视察中我着重视察了有关天主教徒的反革命案件，事实证明他们都犯有很大的罪行。如神甫刘益民，曾组织“公教青年报国团”，天津解放前夕，他率领反动军队与解放军顽抗。可是政府对这样的反革命分子仍然给予了宽大处理，在狱中还允许他每天按时念“日课”。
    上海教徒顾梅青针对朱孔嘉的谬论列举了龚品梅在上海的反革命罪行，他说：“龚品梅这个反革命集团是早已存在的，上海解放后，他们实际上听命于帝国主义，执行着敌视人民政府和社会主义事业的各种阴谋活动。这个反动集团的活动，完全超出了宗教范围，违犯了国家宪法，它是彻头彻尾的反共反人民反社会主义的集团。”
    经过大家摆事实，讲道理，反复进行争辩以后，王文成、赵振声、尉宝山、朱孔嘉和王克谦等人，都词穷理屈，在非常孤立的情况下承认了自己的立场和观点是错误的，没有根据的。他们并同意了其他代表的意见，表示中国天主教徒要真正实现爱国爱教的天职，必须走社会主义道路，拥护共产党领导，同梵蒂冈割断政治上和经济上的关系。中国天主教必须由中国教徒自办，梵蒂冈不得任意干涉。
    在辩论中，许多主教、代主教、神甫和教徒都提出：“凡是来自梵蒂冈的一切通谕、命令等等，都要加以分析，不能盲目从命”。他们还说：“为了中国人民的利益和教会的前途，中国天主教徒要在爱国爱教基础上加强团结，办好自己的教会”。他们还对中国天主教徒自办教会问题提出了具体意见。
