Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said yesterday that Syria will never commit aggression against Israel. However, he reiterated his statement from July 15th, stating that Syria will retaliate with all its might against attacks from any direction.

Al-Asali's remarks were a response to a recent so-called warning from Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, who said that Israel would give a "powerful response" to any "provocation" from Syria. On the same day, a spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Syrian authorities had notified the United Nations Palestine Mixed Armistice Commission of Syria's attitude and asked the commission to "warn the Israeli authorities that although Syria remains loyal to the armistice agreement and the United Nations Charter, it will respond with force to any attack on its territory."

According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio yesterday afternoon, Syrian troops along the Israeli border have been ordered to "enter a state of alert to prepare for any unexpected incidents."

The radio station said that the Syrian-Egyptian Joint Command in Damascus has been in frequent contact with its headquarters in Egypt over the past two days.

    对付以色列的侵略威胁
    叙利亚军队在边境严阵戒备
    据新华社17日讯  大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利昨天说，叙利亚绝不会对以色列进行侵略。但是，他重申15日的话说，叙利亚将以全力来回击来自任何方面的进攻。
    阿萨利的这番话答复了以色列总理本—古里安最近发出的所谓警告，本—古里安说，以色列将对叙利亚的任何“挑衅”予以“强有力报复”。同一天，叙利亚外交部发言人发表声明说，叙利亚当局已经把叙利亚的这种态度通知了联合国巴勒斯坦混合停战委员会，并且要求委员会“警告以色列当局，叙利亚虽然依然忠于停战协定和联合国宪章，但是将以武力答复对它的领土发动的任何进攻。”
    据开罗电台昨天下午广播，沿以色列边境线一带的叙利亚军队已经奉令“进入紧张状态，准备应付任何意外事故。”
    这家电台说，设在大马士革的叙利亚—埃及联合司令部在过去两天内同在埃及的总部一直保持着经常的接触。
