Copper is produced!
    Tongguanshan on the southern bank of the Yangtze River in Anhui is a famous copper producing area in China. During the Anti-Japanese War, Tongguanshan fell into enemy hands. The Japanese had just started construction to build a concentrator when they surrendered. After the Kuomintang "took over," they transported away some of the copper processing machinery, leaving Tongguanshan scarred and desolate. It was not until after liberation that concentrators, smelters, open-pit mines, etc., were built here, transforming it into a mechanized copper mining and smelting complex. The picture shows the copper production situation.

    出铜了！
    安徽长江南岸的铜官山是我国著名的铜矿产地。抗日战争期间，铜官山沦入敌手，日本人刚动工准备兴建选矿厂就投降了。国民党“劫收”后，运走了一些选铜机器，使铜官山满目疮痍，一片荒凉。直到解放以后，这里才兴建了选矿厂、冶炼厂、露天矿厂……，改造成为一座机械化开采和炼铜的联合企业。图为出铜的情况。
