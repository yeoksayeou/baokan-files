In the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, there is currently a rather widespread and pressing problem: late autumn crops lack the fertilizer needed for topdressing, and the base fertilizer needed for autumn sowing needs to be prepared as soon as possible. In Minhou County, Fujian Province, about 100,000 mu of rice paddies lack sufficient base fertilizer this year, accounting for about three-tenths of the rice paddy area; in addition, there are more than 8,000 mu of weak seedlings. According to statistics from 14 counties in the Liaocheng Special District of Shandong Province, the existing fertilizer used as base fertilizer for summer sowing averages only about half a cart per mu; even in areas with more fertilizer accumulation, most of the fertilizer accumulated in winter and spring has been used for topdressing wheat fields and base fertilizer for early rice paddies, and late rice and other late autumn crops still feel a shortage of fertilizer. In Jiangxi Province, early rice has increased by an average of 60 kilograms of fertilizer per mu compared to last year, but the fertilizer for late rice and autumn crops has not yet been secured. Many other regions have similar situations.

Is it true, as some rural cadres and members say, that the sources of fertilizer have been exhausted and the tricks have been exhausted? No. First, summer weeds are lush and easily decompose, making it ideal to cut them and use them to make green manure. Second, weeding is necessary for intertillage, and weeding is necessary to prevent insects. These weeds removed from the fields can also be collected and composted into fertilizer. Third, the straw from summer harvested crops can be used to make compost. Fourth, in areas near lakes and rivers, members can be organized to harvest lake grass and aquatic plants to accumulate fertilizer; there is also a lot of marine fertilizer that can be utilized in coastal areas. Fifth, the phenomenon of "no toilets for people, no pens for pigs, and no fences for cattle" still exists in many areas. For example, in Henan Province, only 40% of pigs have pens. In areas with toilets and pens, there are still cases of neglecting to collect human and animal excrement and urine, allowing it to be lost. This is the greatest waste of a very good fertilizer and should be given special attention and efforts should be made to change it.

On the one hand, there is no shortage of fertilizer sources; on the other hand, there is a feeling of insufficient fertilizer. This is a contradiction. After agricultural cooperativization, small-scale production has become collective production; however, fertilizer accumulation by members' families is still the main source of fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, in addition to organizing collective fertilizer accumulation activities, agricultural cooperatives in various regions must find ways to encourage the enthusiasm of members' families for fertilizer accumulation. Some cooperative cadres one-sidedly believe that lowering the price of manure can reduce production costs; in fact, doing so is equivalent to deducting the labor remuneration that should be given to members who accumulate fertilizer, which is equivalent to encouraging everyone not to accumulate fertilizer. Some cooperatives use simple methods, such as taking over all the toilets and manure cellars of the members free of charge. In these places, toilets often collapse, many manure cellars become "clear water cellars," and pig and cattle manure are scattered all over the ground and no one picks it up. Some cooperatives that buy fertilizer accumulated by members do not distinguish between good and bad quality, but simply stipulate a general price; or the quality grades are assessed unreasonably; or they simply use the method of averaging a few yuan per year for large and small populations and large and small livestock. This makes the members unwilling to put the fertilizer into the cooperative, but only willing to send it to their private plots, forming the phenomenon of "no fertilizer for the cooperative's crops, but plenty of fertilizer for private vegetable gardens." Some cooperatives do not record work points or buy fertilizer that exceeds the quota in contracted work and contracted production, or even simply allocate fertilizer accumulation as "obligatory labor," which also seriously undermines the enthusiasm of members for fertilizer accumulation. These phenomena must be changed. It should be understood that taking these measures, although on the surface, reduces the expenses of the agricultural cooperative and seems to reduce costs; however, the result will inevitably be that the output cannot be increased or even reduced due to the lack of fertilizer, which is detrimental to both the agricultural cooperative and the members when the overall account is calculated.

How can we mobilize the enthusiasm of members' families for fertilizer accumulation? In addition to continuing to strengthen ideological education on the consistency of collective and individual interests, the most important thing is to implement a mutually beneficial policy and provide reasonable remuneration based on the quality and quantity of fertilizer. Some cooperatives have already adopted the method of "pricing according to quality, counting by the kilogram, and paying cash," which the members are very satisfied with and their enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation is very high. Generally speaking, the reward system and management methods for fertilizer accumulation must be "giving money when there is money," "giving goods when there are goods," or "paying in installments." In this way, as far as the members are concerned, they are not only supporting the cooperative, but also getting some pocket money. Experience has shown that as long as a mutually beneficial policy is implemented, the members will be willing to accumulate fertilizer.

"Pricing according to quality and paying cash" is indeed a good way to stimulate the enthusiasm of members for fertilizer accumulation; but not all agricultural cooperatives can do it. Some agricultural cooperatives were established not long ago, have little capital accumulation, unstable production, insufficient experience, or have suffered poor harvests due to natural disasters, and are unable to repay the members' fertilizer investment. Members "cannot see money at both ends of the year," so they are unwilling to accumulate fertilizer. These types of agricultural cooperatives can use the method of recording work points according to the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated by members' families, and then uniformly distribute cash and in-kind goods after the autumn harvest. However, before doing so, it must be fully discussed by the members to make the households with more fertilizer accumulation and more labor feel fair and reasonable. The fertilizer investment owed to the members in the past must also be made up to maintain credit.

This year, some areas feel that there is not enough chemical fertilizer, and there are also many areas where very little chemical fertilizer is sold and it is stockpiled. This is another contradictory phenomenon in fertilizer use. One of the reasons why chemical fertilizer is not selling well in some areas is that agricultural cooperatives lack funds; however, some cooperatives have funds but do not buy fertilizer, and some cooperatives know that members have surplus money but do not actively mobilize members to invest. Some cooperative cadres have a one-sided understanding of the slogan of running cooperatives thriftily. They have not calculated the accounts clearly and do not understand that appropriate additional investment can increase production more, and blindly believe that additional investment is definitely not worthwhile. In order to quickly solve this problem, agricultural cooperatives in various regions can sign contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to pre-pay grain and cotton deposits to purchase chemical fertilizer; if they are really unable to purchase, they can borrow from credit cooperatives or temporarily sell some on credit. In short, all effective methods must be used to ensure that stockpiled chemical fertilizer can play its due role in increasing agricultural production in a timely manner.

The contradiction between fertilizer accumulation and soil and water conservation should also be addressed. In some southern regions, such as Jiangxi and Guangxi provinces, sod removal is the main source of fertilizer. Due to repeated sod removal, many lush green mountains have become bald, and soil erosion is serious. This will cause the fertility of the land to decline year by year, damaging long-term interests. Some farmers also go up the mountains to burn grass and wood ash, causing forest fires that spread to trees, causing significant losses. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention to preventing these deviations.

Now is the best time to accumulate fertilizer. Agricultural cooperatives should properly arrange and plan the current tasks of agricultural cooperatives, not only to do a good job in autumn field management and sideline production, but also to complete the fertilizer accumulation task on time, and not to stop fertilizer accumulation work due to busy farming or only focusing on sideline business. Rural work cadres in various regions should inspect and supervise fertilizer accumulation work at any time, go deep into agricultural cooperatives to help solve specific problems in fertilizer accumulation, and pay attention to summarizing good experiences in this regard and promoting them in a timely manner.

### 不要放过积肥的大好时机

    不要放过积肥的大好时机
    在争取农业大丰收的斗争中，目前有一个相当普遍的迫切的问题——晚秋作物缺少追肥所需要的肥料，秋播所需要的基肥也急待早作准备。福建闽侯县今年施基肥不足的稻田约有十万亩，占稻田面积十分之三左右；另有白水秧八千多亩。山东聊城专区十四个县统计，现有肥料用作夏播基肥，每亩平均只有半车左右；就是积肥较多的地区，冬春所积肥料也大部用作麦田追肥和早稻田基肥了，晚稻和其他晚秋作物仍感肥料不足。江西省早稻每亩比去年平均增加了六担肥料，但晚稻和秋作的肥料还没有着落。别的许多地区也有类似的情况。
    是不是像某些农村干部和社员所说的，现在肥源已经挖尽，窍门已经找绝了呢？不是的。第一，夏季杂草繁茂，容易沤烂，正好割来沤绿肥。第二，中耕要除草，为了防虫要除草，这些除掉的田间杂草也可以搜集起来沤成肥料。第三，夏收作物的秸秆可以用来造堆肥。第四，在滨湖近河地区可以组织社员打湖草和水草积肥；沿海一带还有很多海肥可以利用。第五，很多地区还存在着“人无厕所、猪无圈、牛无栏”的现象。如河南省仅有40％的猪有圈。在有厕所栏圈的地区，也还有不注意积攒人畜粪尿而任凭丢失的情形。这是对于一种最好的肥料的最大的浪费，更应该特别注意，设法改变。
    一方面，肥源并不缺乏；一方面，肥料却感到不足。这是一个矛盾。农业合作化以后，小生产已经变成了集体生产；但是，社员家庭积肥，目前还是农业社肥料的主要来源。因此，各地农业合作社除了有组织地进行集体积肥活动以外，必须从各方面想办法来鼓励社员家庭积肥的积极性。有些社干部片面地认为压低粪价可以降低生产成本；其实，这样做就等于克扣积攒肥料的社员应得的劳动报酬，也就等于鼓励大家不积肥。有的社却采用简单的办法，把社员的厕所、粪窖统统无偿归社。这些地方往往搞得厕所倒塌，许多粪窖变成了“清水窖”，遍地猪牛野粪无人拣。有些社收买社员所积的肥料也不分好坏，只是笼统地规定一个价格；或者把质量等级评得不合理；或者干脆用大小人口和大小牲畜一年各几元钱平均包下来的办法，这就使得社员不愿把肥料投入社里，只愿往自留地里送，形成“社里庄稼无肥料，私人菜园施个饱”的现象。还有的社在包工包产中对超额完成的肥料既不记工，也不收买，甚至根本把积肥当作“义务工”来摊派，这同样严重地挫伤了社员的积肥积极性。这些现象必须改变。要知道，采取这些做法，虽然从表面上看是减少了农业社的开支，似乎可以降低成本；但是，其结果必然是因缺少肥料而使产量不能增加甚至减少，算起总账来对农业社和社员都是不利的。
    怎样才能调动社员家庭积肥的积极性呢？除了继续加强集体利益和个人利益一致性的思想教育工作以外，最重要的是贯彻执行互利政策，根据肥料的质量和数量给予合理的报酬。目前有些社已经采用“按质论价，以斤计数，现金收买”的办法，社员很满意，积肥情绪很高。一般说来，对于积肥的报酬制度和管理办法，必须做到“有钱给钱”、“有物给物”或“分期付款”。这样，在社员说来，既支援了社，又可以得到一些零用钱。经验证明，只要贯彻执行了互利政策，社员就都愿意积肥了。
    “按质论价、现金收买”，确实是激发社员积肥积极性的好办法；但并不是所有的农业社都能做到的。有的农业社成立不久，资金积累少，生产不稳定，经验不足，或因自然灾害而遭致歉收，无力偿还社员积肥的投资，社员“一年两头见不到钱”，便不愿积肥。这类农业社，对社员家庭积肥可以采用按肥料数量和质量记工分的办法，到秋后统一分配现金和实物。不过在这样做以前，必须经过社员的充分讨论，使积肥多和劳力多的户都感到公平合理。对于过去拖欠社员的肥料投资，也必须设法补齐，保持信用。
    今年有的地区感到化学肥料不够，也有不少地区化学肥料销出很少，积压起来。这是肥料使用上的另一个矛盾现象。一些地区化学肥料不好销售的原因之一是农业社资金不足；但是，有些社有资金也不买肥料，有些社明知社员手里有余钱也不积极发动社员投资。有些社干部对勤俭办社的口号作了片面的了解，他们没有把账算清，不了解适当多投资可以更多增产，而盲目地认为多投资一定不合算。为了迅速解决这个问题，各地农业社可以同供销社订立合同，预支粮棉定金来购买化肥；实在无力购买的，可向信用社贷款，或者暂时赊销一部分。总之，要采用一切有效的办法，使积压的化肥及时地在农业增产中发挥应有的作用。
    积肥和水土保持的矛盾，也应该注意解决。南方有些地区如江西、广西等省，铲草皮是主要的肥源。由于一铲再铲，很多葱绿的山岭变成了光秃秃的童山，水土流失严重。这将使土地肥力逐年减退，损害长远利益。也有的农民上山烧草木灰，引起山火延烧树木，造成重大损失。希望各地注意防止这些偏差。
    现在正是积肥的最好时机，农业社应该把当前农业社的各项工作加以妥善安排，作出规划，既要搞好秋田管理和副业生产，又要按时完成积肥任务，不要因为农忙或只顾经营副业而把积肥工作停顿下来。各地农村工作干部都应该随时检查和督促积肥工作，深入农业社帮助解决积肥中的具体问题，并且注意总结这方面的好经验，及时推广。
