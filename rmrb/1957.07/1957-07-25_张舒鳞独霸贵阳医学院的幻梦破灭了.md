    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Guizhou Daily, all teachers and staff of Guiyang Medical College and its affiliated hospital held consecutive meetings from July 3rd to 10th, exposing and criticizing Zhang Shulin, a member of the Jiusan Society and the president of the affiliated hospital, for his anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.
    Lecturer Zhu Qinggan said that the Party member vice president had become a thorn in Zhang Shulin's side and the main target of his attacks and exclusion. For example, after Vice President An joined the Party, Zhang Shulin hated him and never consulted him on anything; Vice President Yang Jiequan was assigned to medical teaching work, but when the hospital held meetings to discuss medical teaching issues, Zhang Shulin did not notify him; Vice President Wang was in charge of the outpatient clinic, but Zhang Shulin did not invite him to attend meetings to discuss outpatient clinic issues. Zhang Shulin also undermined the prestige of the Party member vice presidents everywhere, saying that the several Party member vice presidents were useless, saying that this was an amateur interfering in professional matters and had messed up the affiliated hospital. After he returned from Beijing, on the one hand, he abolished the president's meeting system; on the other hand, he clamored, "I can't see the Party," deliberately confusing the public.
    The meeting also revealed many materials of Zhang Shulin slandering the Provincial Health Department and refusing to implement the instructions of higher authorities. Lecturer Zhou Guangyuan said: Zhang Shulin used to say everywhere that the Health Department did not support him, but when the Health Department allocated funds to increase the number of beds and requested that it be increased to 450 this year, he insisted on only 300, and told the masses that 300 beds were not enough. Vice President Wang Cunfang revealed Zhang Shulin's violation of the leadership of the Provincial Health Department.
    Yu Weishui, secretary of the college office, said: Zhang Shulin has always opposed Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union. He openly declared: Marxism-Leninism is no longer popular now, and scolding the study of advanced Soviet experience is dogmatism. Lecturer Tang Dian said: Once, when it was raining, I was walking with Zhang Shulin, and he suddenly asked me where the rain came from. He said: This is closely related to the Soviet Union's testing of atomic bombs in Siberia. This is intentional rumor-mongering and slander. Zhang Shulin has repeatedly slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "inhuman and utterly devoid of conscience," etc.

    张舒鳞独霸贵阳医学院的幻梦破灭了
    本报讯　据贵州日报报道：贵阳医学院及其附属医院的全体教师和职工于7月3日到10日连续开会，揭发和批判了附属医院院长九三学社成员张舒鳞反共、反社会主义的言行。
    朱清干讲师说，党员副院长已成了张舒鳞的眼中钉，成了他打击和排斥的主要目标。如安副院长入党后，张舒鳞就仇恨他，什么事都不找他商量；杨洁泉副院长分工搞医疗教学工作，但院里开会研究医疗教学问题时，张舒鳞也不通知他，王副院长负责门诊，开会研究门诊问题时张舒鳞也不叫他参加。张舒鳞还四处破坏党员副院长的威信，把几位党员副院长说得一无是处，说这是外行人干内行事，把附院搞糟了。他从北京回来后，一方面取消院长会议的制度；一方面又叫嚣：“看不见党”，故意在群众中混淆视听。
    会上还揭露了张舒鳞诽谤省卫生厅、拒绝执行上级指示的许多材料。周光远讲师说：张舒鳞以前到处说卫生厅不支持他，但当卫生厅拨款增加病床，要求今年发展到四百五十张时，他却一口咬定只要三百张，在群众中又说三百张床是不够的。王存芳副院长揭露张舒鳞违抗省卫生厅的领导。
    学院办公室秘书于渭水说：张舒鳞一贯反对马列主义和苏联，他公开宣称：现在马列主义不吃香了，骂学习苏联先进经验就是教条主义。讲师唐电说：有一次，正在下雨，我和张舒鳞走在一起，他突然问我雨是怎么来的，他说：这与苏联在西伯利亚实验原子弹是有很大关系的。这是有意地造谣和诬蔑。张舒鳞曾好几次诬蔑肃反是“惨无人道、丧尽天良”等等。
