    Old Proposal Re-Examined After More Than a Century
    Britain and the United States Vie to Tunnel Under the English Channel
    (Reported by this newspaper) More than a century ago, someone suggested building an underwater tunnel connecting the European continent and the British Isles. In 1802, French army engineer Mathieu proposed to Napoleon the construction of an underwater tunnel to facilitate an invasion of Britain.
    Mathieu's plan was not realized. However, since then, the idea of ​​building a Channel Tunnel has been repeatedly brought up. After 1870, some companies were established and attempted construction, but all failed due to lack of funds. In Folkestone, a coastal town in Britain, the remains of a mile-long tunnel dug by the British Channel Tunnel Company in 1880 can still be seen. At the time, the strongest opposition to the construction of the Channel Tunnel came from British military personnel, who feared that the Channel Tunnel might become a passage for invasion of Britain from the continent. However, in 1929, a committee of the British Parliament issued a report stating: "From an economic point of view, building a Channel Tunnel is beneficial to Britain." However, due to continued opposition from British military personnel, the construction plan remained shelved.
    In the autumn of 1956, when Britain became interested in the European Free Trade Area issue, the Channel Tunnel issue re-attracted people's attention. British military personnel also changed their tune, believing that the Channel Tunnel would be beneficial to military "cooperation" between Britain and Western European countries. However, the main reason that prompted Britain to take a positive attitude was the struggle between American and British monopoly capitalists. Originally, in order to strengthen its control over Europe, the United States expressed great interest in the plan to build an underwater tunnel under the English Channel. The American attempt alarmed Britain. Mr. Delange, chairman of the British Channel Tunnel Company, quickly announced at the company's shareholders meeting in May this year that the company had held several meetings with the old Suez Canal Company, hoping to use the old Suez Canal Company's funds to build this twenty-two-mile-long underwater tunnel, which would cost approximately 100 million pounds and take ten years.
    However, in order not to offend the Americans too much, Delange said when mentioning the United States: "The Americans are very interested, and it would certainly be wise to ask them to cooperate when the time is right."

    一百多年前的旧议重提
    英美争凿英吉利海峡隧道
    本报讯　一个半世纪以前，就有人建议开凿一条沟通欧洲大陆与英伦三岛的海底隧道。1802年，法国陆军工程师马梯厄曾向拿破仑献策建造海底隧道，以便向英国进军。
    马梯厄的计划没有实现。不过从那时起，开凿海峡隧道的事情不断有人提起。1870年以后，还成立了一些公司，进行了开凿的尝试，可是都因为缺乏资金而告失败。在英国滨海的地方福尔克斯东现在还可以看得见1880年英国海峡隧道公司所挖掘的、长达一英里的隧道遗迹。当时反对开凿海峡隧道最力的是英国军方人士，他们担心海峡隧道可能成为由大陆入侵英国的一条通路。但是到了1929年，英国国会的一个委员会发表报告说：“从经济上来讲，开凿海峡隧道对英国是有利的。”不过由于英国军方人士仍旧反对，开凿计划仍然搁浅。
    1956年秋季，英国对欧洲自由贸易区问题发生兴趣，海峡隧道问题重新吸引了人们的注意。英国军方人士也改变了腔调，认为海峡隧道有利于英国与西欧国家军事的“合作”。但是促使英国态度积极起来的主要原因还是美、英垄断资本家之间的斗争。原来美国为了加强对欧洲的控制，对开凿英吉利海峡海底隧道计划表示了极大的兴趣。美国的企图引起了英国的惊恐。英国海峡隧道公司董事长德兰格赶紧于今年5月在该公司股东大会上宣布说，该公司已与旧苏伊士运河公司进行了几次会谈，希望利用旧苏伊士运河公司的资金来开凿这条长达二十二英里、建造费用约一亿英镑、需时十年的海底隧道。
    但是为了不致太冒犯了美国人，德兰格在提到美国的时候说：“美国人很感兴趣，在适当的时候请他们合作当然是明智的。”
