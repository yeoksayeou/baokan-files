Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 12th: The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held a plenary session on June 28th, 29th, and from July 1st to 3rd.

    The Central Plenary Session discussed and approved the report made by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej on behalf of the Politburo. The report’s content was based on the tasks put forward by the Second Congress of the Workers' Party and the conclusions drawn from international events and the activities of communist and workers' parties in various countries, based on the lessons of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Central Plenary Session pointed out the tasks of further improving the work of the Party in the resolution it adopted.

    The resolution pointed out: At a time when the ideological struggle between capitalism and socialism is intensifying, the solidarity of the fraternal parties is more helpful than ever in strengthening the strength and unity of the international communist movement.

    The resolution stipulated the following tasks for the party: 1. Strengthen party unity and iron discipline; 2. Strengthen the party's ties with the masses; 3. Develop socialist democracy; 4. Develop the economy and improve the living standards of the working people; 5. Improve the level of ideological work; 6. Strengthen and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The resolution mentioned the facts of the mistakes committed by the Romanian Workers' Party Politburo members Chișinevschi and Constantinescu and the differences with them. The resolution stated that in preparing the report for the March 1956 Central Plenary Session, and at the April Central Plenary Session and Politburo meetings in the same year, they neglected the significant achievements made by the Party and the state as a result of the expulsion of right-wing splittists at the 1952 Central Plenary Session, nor did they see the achievements of the August 1953 Central Plenary Session and the Second Party Congress; they distorted the Party’s leadership and activities. They adopted factionalist methods of anti-Party cabal activities, conducting discussions outside the Party, building alliances, and attempting to pull other Politburo members to their anti-Party positions. The resolution stated that they wanted to steer our Party's discussion of the documents of the 20th Congress of the CPSU in a wrong direction, and they opposed the resolution of the March plenary session of last year. They opposed the state security organs.

    The resolution said that Chișinevschi bears great responsibility for implementing the liquidationist policy of the Luca and Pauker splitting groups within the Party. Constantinescu, while in charge of national economic work, deviated from reality, adopted a superficial attitude when explaining economic issues, and committed serious errors in planning work.

    The resolution said that the Central Plenary Session, taking into account their anti-Party stance, decided to remove them from their positions as Politburo members and remove Comrade Chișinevschi from his position as Secretary of the Secretariat in order to strengthen Party unity. However, they remain members of the Central Committee.

    The resolution said that they had stated at the plenary session that they considered the punishment to be correct and that they guaranteed to overcome the serious mistakes they had committed through their own work.

    罗马尼亚工人党中央全会通过决议
    加强党的团结发展社会主义民主
    对两个政治局委员所犯的错误给予批评和处分
    据新华社布加勒斯特12日电　罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会在6月28日、29日和从7月1日到3日期间举行了全体会议。
    中央全会讨论和批准了乔治乌—德治代表政治局所作的报告，这个报告的内容是根据工人党第二次代表大会提出的任务和根据苏共二十次代表大会的教训从国际事件以及各国共产党、工人党的活动中得出的结论所进行的工作。中央全会在通过的决议中指出了进一步改进党的工作的任务。
    决议指出：在目前资本主义和社会主义之间思想斗争尖锐化时，兄弟党的团结一致，是比任何时候更加有助于加强国际共产主义运动的力量和团结。
    决议中为党规定了以下几个任务：一、加强党的团结和铁的纪律；二、加强党与群众的联系；三、发展社会主义的民主；四、发展经济和提高劳动人民的生活水平；五、提高思想工作的水平；六、加强和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。
    决议中谈到了罗马尼亚工人党政治局委员基辛涅夫斯基和康斯坦丁尼斯库所犯的错误事实以及同他们的分歧问题。决议说，在准备1956年3月中央全会报告时，在同年4月的中央全会和政治局会议上，他们忽视了由于在1952年中央全会开除右倾分裂主义者，党和国家所获得的重大成就，也没有看到1953年8月中央全会和第二次党代表大会的成就，他们歪曲了党的领导和党的活动。他们采取了反党的小集团活动的分裂主义的方法，在党外进行讨论，建立联盟，企图把其他政治局委员拉到他们的反党立场上来。决议说，他们想把我们党对苏共第二十次代表大会文件的讨论引向一个错误的方向，他们反对去年3月全会的决议。他们反对国家保安机关。
    决议说，基辛涅夫斯基对在党内执行卢加和波克分裂集团的取消主义政策要负很大责任。康斯坦丁尼斯库在负责国民经济工作期间脱离实际，在说明经济问题的时候采取了一种肤浅的态度，在计划工作中犯了严重的错误。
    决议说，中央全会考虑到他们的反党的立场，为了加强党的团结一致，决定解除他们政治局委员的职务，并且解除基辛涅夫斯基同志书记处书记的职务。但是他们仍然是中央委员会的委员。
    决议说，他们曾经在全会上声明，认为对他们的处分是正确的，他们保证将通过自己的工作来克服他们犯的严重错误。
