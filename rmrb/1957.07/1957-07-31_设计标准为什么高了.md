    In capital construction, various departments have already taken many effective measures to overcome the tendency towards excessively high design standards. However, many design standards are still too high. Why is this? Because we often fail to comprehensively consider the various conditions of capital construction, and we often lack serious analysis and research on China's economic situation and the people's living standards, which has led to the formation of a "high standard framework." In fact, the formulation of design standards must consider technical requirements and the reasonable needs of life, ensuring project quality and good working conditions; but at the same time, it must consider China's current economic situation and the people's living standards and habits.

    China's national economy has undergone great development after several years of recovery and construction. However, China is still a relatively backward country in terms of economy and culture. We are a large country, but also a poor country. We demand to spend less money, accomplish more, and build the country diligently and thriftily.

    Some people say that from the current point of view, the standards may be a bit high, but things are changing, and today's high standards may not be high tomorrow. They leave a large distance between workshops, and expand the area of reserved land and the front area of the factory; hygiene standards, earthquake resistance, fire prevention, air defense and other facilities all adopt excessively high standards. Many factory designs, regardless of specific conditions, invariably require the construction of large office buildings and clubs. Due to the excessively high industrial building standards, the construction area of some living rooms accounts for 20% of the workshop construction area. As for the factory building area being too wide, the building height being too high, and the structure being too good, these phenomena are even more common. Compared with the Beiman Steel Plant, the billet warehouse of the steel rolling workshop of Daye Special Steel Plant has a quota of 7 tons per square meter with a turnover time of eleven days, while Daye has a quota of 3 tons per square meter with a turnover time of eighteen days. According to calculations, the former has 2,900 square meters more building area than the latter. The finished product warehouse of the Daye rolling workshop has more than 4,600 square meters more building area than the Beiman Steel Plant; at the same time, Daye also designed a general finished product warehouse with an area of 4,860 square meters more than Beiman. There are no special requirements for these three warehouses in terms of technology, but some adopt metal structures. There are also unreasonable aspects in other process methods, equipment selection, and overall layout. These are excessively high designs that do not meet actual needs.

    May I ask, is it worth advocating for designs that excessively consider the "long-term vision" and completely deviate from the current level of productive forces and the current economic conditions? Of course not. So, how can we break this "high standard design framework"?

    To break the high standard framework, we must solve the problem of combining long-term and short-term, permanent and simple. China's socialist construction plan must strive to achieve it as soon as possible, which is beyond doubt. However, according to China's actual situation, to better strive for national industrialization, we must maximize the limited investment, increase production as soon as possible, and increase accumulation. Adopting lower standards to build enterprises, developing production, and increasing national wealth, in twenty or thirty years, we will be in a better position to raise our construction standards.

    Recently, there has also been an argument that since 1955, much effort has been made to reduce project costs; if we want to further reduce the design standards of some capital construction in 1957, it seems that there is not much "oil and water" left. What is the truth? As long as we earnestly implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and under the premise of ensuring the quality of major construction projects and the necessary technical equipment, there are still many ways to save money in economic design. It is estimated that if we can work hard to reduce project costs in all aspects, we can save at least about 20% of construction funds compared to the past for the same project in the future. According to the analysis of five mine shafts, including Pingdingshan No. 6 well and Yangquhe No. 1 well, by the coal system, the investment per ton can be reduced to 23.3 yuan, which is 22% lower than the average investment of the original design. In the power industry, according to the analysis of five power stations, the investment per kilowatt can be reduced to 880 yuan, which is 20% lower than the average investment of the original design. In other aspects such as cotton spinning, fertilizer, cement, and steel, the investment can be reduced by 20% to 30%. Although the above are estimates, these figures fully prove that it is worthwhile to revise design standards and reduce project costs.

    There is still much work to be done in earnestly overcoming the tendency of excessively high standards in capital construction, especially in some industrial designs, to adapt to China's current economic level and the people's living standards. First of all, the design standards stipulated by relevant departments in the past should be appropriately revised. When designing, for the parts that are obviously felt to be unreasonable, they should be revised as soon as possible. Secondly, for the factories and mines that have been designed or are being designed, a comprehensive inspection should also be carried out, and appropriate revisions should be made based on the actual situation after analysis and research, and in a realistic manner. In other aspects such as excessive safety factors, excessively wide economic and technical quotas, and excessive consumption of metal, wood, cement building materials, attention should also be paid to correction in the design. However, it must also be noted that while revising the standards, we must ensure the quality of the project, ensure the smooth progress of production, and ensure the necessary labor conditions for workers' production, and we should never carry out economy unilaterally.

    China's achievements in capital construction in recent years have been very significant, and the experience and lessons of design work in capital construction are very rich. The problem now is to summarize these experiences and lessons in order to further improve the design work level of capital construction, so that we can truly do more things with the same money in the Second Five-Year Plan, and do them better.

### 设计标准为什么高了

    设计标准为什么高了
    在基本建设中，各部门已经采取了许多有效的措施，克服某些设计标准过高的偏向。可是，有许多设计标准仍然偏高了。这是为什么呢？因为我们常常没有全面地考虑基本建设的各种条件，常常缺乏对我国的经济状况和人民生活水平的认真分析和研究，以致形成了一种“高标准的框子”。其实，制定设计标准，固然要考虑技术上的要求和生活上的合理需要，保证工程质量和良好的劳动条件；但是，同时必须考虑我国当前的经济状况和人民的生活水平和习惯。
    我国的国民经济，经过了几年来恢复和建设，有了很大的发展。但是，我国仍然是一个经济和文化比较落后的国家。我们是一个大国，又是一个穷国。我们要求少花钱，多办事，勤俭建国。
    有人说，从目前来看，标准也许高一些，可是事情是要变化的，今天的高标准，明天也许就不高了。他们把各个车间之间的距离留得很大，预留地、厂前区的面积都扩大了；卫生标准、防震、防火、防空等设施都采用了过高的标准。许多工厂的设计，不看具体条件，一律要建筑很大的办公大楼、俱乐部。由于工业建筑标准偏高，以致有的生活间的建筑面积占到车间建筑面积的20％。至于厂房的面积过宽，建筑物的高度过高，结构过好，这些现象更是常见的。大冶特殊钢厂的轧钢车间的钢坯仓库同北满钢厂比较，后者定额为每平方公尺堆存七吨，周转时间十一天，而大冶是每平方公尺堆存三吨，周转时间是十八天。计算起来，建筑面积前者比后者多二千九百平方公尺。大冶轧钢车间的成品库，建筑面积比北满钢厂多四千六百多平方公尺；同时，大冶比北满还多设计了一个面积达四千八百六十平方公尺的总成品库。这三个仓库，在工艺上没有什么特殊要求，有的却采用了金属结构。其他在工艺方法、设备选择和总平面布置等方面，都有不合理的地方。这些都是不切合实际需要的过高的设计。
    试问这样过多地考虑了“远景”，而完全离开了当前生产力的发展水平，离开了目前的经济条件的设计是值得提倡的吗？当然不是。那末，怎样才能打破这种“高标准的设计框子”呢？
    要打破高标准的框子，必须解决长远同近期、永久同简易的结合问题。我国的社会主义建设计划一定要争取尽快地实现，这是不容怀疑的。但是，根据我国的实际情况，更好地争取国家工业化，就要最大限度地发挥有限的投资，尽快地提高生产，增加积累。采用较低的标准，把企业办起来了，生产发展了，国家财富增加了，二三十年后，就更有条件来提高我们建设的标准。
    近来还出现过一种论调，说1955年以来，在降低工程造价方面已作过不少的努力；1957年再要降低某些基本建设的设计标准，看来似乎是油水不大了。事实怎么样呢？只要是认真地执行勤俭建国的方针，在保证主要建筑工程的质量和必要的技术装备的条件下，经济设计方面努力节约的途径还是很多的。据估算，如果我们能从各方面努力降低工程造价，今后建设同样的工程，比过去至少可以节省20％左右的建设资金。根据煤炭系统对平顶山六号井、羊渠河一号井等五个矿井的分析，每吨投资可降低到二十三元三角，比原设计平均投资降低22％以上。在电力工业方面，根据五个电站的分析，每瓩投资可降低到八百八十元，比原设计平均投资降低20％以上。其他在棉纺、肥料、水泥、钢铁等方面，都可以降低投资百分之二、三十不等。以上虽是估算，但是，这些数字，却充分地证明了修改设计标准、降低工程造价是大有可为的。
    认真地克服基本建设特别是某些工业设计中标准过高的偏向，以适应我国目前的经济水平和人民的生活水平，在这方面需要作的工作还有很多。首先，对过去有关部门规定的设计标准，应当作适当的修改。在设计的时候，对于已经明显地感到不合理的部分，应该尽快修改。其次，对于已经设计或正在设计的厂矿，也要全盘进行检查，根据实际情况，经过分析研究以后，实事求是地作适当的修改。其他在安全系数过大、经济技术定额过宽以及耗用金属、木材、水泥建筑材料过多等方面，也要在设计中注意改正。但是，也必须注意，在修改标准的同时，必须保证工程质量，保证生产的顺利进行，保证工人生产时必要的劳动条件，而决不应该片面地进行节约。
    我国几年来基本建设的成绩是非常巨大的，关于基本建设中的设计工作的经验教训非常丰富。现在的问题是要总结这些经验教训，以便进一步提高基本建设的设计工作水平，使我们在第二个五年计划中真正作到用同样的钱，办更多的事情，而且办得更好。
