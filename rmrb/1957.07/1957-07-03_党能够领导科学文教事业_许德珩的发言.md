The current representative assembly is convened on the eve of the imminent victorious completion of our country's first Five-Year Plan. Before the meeting, Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was officially published. This is another beacon illuminating the path of victory for the people of the whole country. We have studied this speech many times, and we will continue to study it in depth in the future, drawing tremendous strength from it to serve the people better.

Since the beginning of the meeting, I have listened to Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and other work reports. I fully agree with and support these reports. Premier Zhou's historically significant report, based on the principles put forward in Chairman Mao's speech, summarized the achievements, shortcomings, and lessons learned in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past few years. It pointed out the specific guidelines for us to continue to move forward, affirmed the brilliant achievements made by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party, and sternly criticized the reactionary speeches of the bourgeois rightists against the Party and against socialism. It powerfully defended the interests of our people and strengthened the socialist construction and socialist transformation with unparalleled strength.

	Rightists' attempt to shake the foundation of the country and undermine the Constitution will never be accepted by the people of the whole country.

In order to better lead and unite the people of the whole country in socialist construction, the Chinese Communist Party launched a rectification movement within the Party in early May and invited non-Party members to help the Party rectify its work. The vast majority of people from all walks of life across the country, including members of democratic parties, put forward opinions and helped the Party rectify its work and improve its work in the spirit of loving the Party and starting from the desire for unity. In the process of rectification, the Party implemented the spirit of rectifying and correcting at the same time, listened to the opinions of the masses, put forward methods for improvement, and implemented them as soon as possible. This shows how selfless and open-minded the Chinese Communist Party is, and how closely linked the Party is with the people. It can be predicted that the goal of rectification can be fully achieved victoriously.

However, during the rectification process, a sinister wind appeared. Rightist ambitionists used the opportunity of rectification to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. They deliberately exaggerated shortcomings, obliterated achievements, and portrayed the shortcomings or mistakes of individual places or individual members as the shortcomings or mistakes of the entire Party in order to confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white. They also fabricated facts and wantonly slandered, portraying certain shortcomings that were unavoidable in the advancement of our socialist cause, or certain shortcomings in the work style of individual members, as the products of the socialist system or the people's democratic system, attempting to achieve their despicable goal of negating the leadership of the Communist Party, negating the socialist path, and restoring capitalism in China. They said: "'The Party's world' is the ultimate source of producing factionalism," "The source of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism is the dictatorship of the proletariat," "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." Isn't this an attempt to negate the leadership of the Party and overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship (dictatorship of the proletariat)? They said: "The bourgeoisie does not have two sides," "There is no essential difference between workers and bourgeois elements," "Fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income." They exhausted their minds to beautify capitalism and refused to reform bourgeois elements. Isn't this an attempt to restore capitalism in China? Rightist ambitionists even put forward absurd proposals such as the so-called "Political Design Institute" and "Rehabilitation Committee,"妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想 to change our country's current political system and replace socialist democracy with capitalist "democracy." Some of them even frantically clamored for the Communist Party to "step down," saying that "even if the Communist Party doesn't lead, others won't sell out the country." The various absurd remarks of the rightist ambitionists against the Party, against the people's democratic system, and against socialism have aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of the whole country. The Chinese people, who have won victory after untold hardships, must protect the core force that leads us – the Chinese Communist Party – and protect the fruits of our revolutionary victory – the people's democratic system and the socialist system – like protecting their own eyes. The leadership of the Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship, and the socialist path have been enshrined in the Constitution and are jointly observed by the people of the whole country. The rightist ambitionists' delusion of shaking the foundation of the country and undermining the solemn Constitution will never be accepted by the people of the whole country! Nor will the comrades of our Jiusan Society! The rightist ambitionists should know that your absurd remarks are only being cheered on by the reactionary newspapers and periodicals in Taiwan and Hong Kong, who regard you as their "patriots" and "benevolent people" and want to use all their strength to support you. Who exactly are you speaking for? Isn't this very clear?

	The right of leadership over the people's scientific and cultural undertakings must not be encroached upon.

Rightist ambitionists also spread various absurd remarks to find a market among intellectuals and attack the Party's leadership in scientific and cultural institutions. Some people said: The Party cannot lead science. Some people said: China's scientific undertakings after liberation are more backward than in the Kuomintang era. The problem in the next twelve years is not to catch up with the international level, but to make up for the past twelve years of lessons. Some people believe that it is impossible to make a nationwide long-term plan for scientific undertakings, and it can only be carried out spontaneously and dispersedly by scientists. They even more absurdly believe that the existence of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission is a manifestation of distrust of Chinese scientists. Some people obliterate the achievements of the adjustment of departments and teaching reform in universities and colleges after liberation, negate the Party's leadership in school education, negate the necessity of carrying out political and ideological education in schools, and clamor for the Party to withdraw from schools and abolish political classes in schools. Some people also put forward the so-called "democratic school management" plan and the "professor-governed school" proposition. We resolutely oppose these right-wing remarks that undermine the people's scientific and cultural undertakings, and resolutely oppose the despicable conspiracy of right-wing ambitionists who妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想 to seize the leadership of scientific and cultural undertakings. We believe that the Chinese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has not only led the Chinese people to achieve the great victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution, but will also be able to successfully lead science and lead the country's cultural and educational undertakings. In fact, the achievements of our scientific and cultural undertakings in the eight years since liberation are unparalleled in any era in Chinese history. This is the result of the Party's leadership. Since liberation, the Party and the government have given unlimited care, support, and assistance to scientists and cultural and educational workers, making them feel that heroes have a place to use their talents, and feel that their work is not only meaningful but also powerful, thereby giving play to their enthusiasm in their work. The scientific and cultural undertakings of the new China are to serve the people and serve socialism. If there is no leadership of the Communist Party and no ideological arming of Marxism-Leninism, who will it serve? Is it to serve capitalism? That is absolutely unacceptable to the people of the whole country! It is absolutely unacceptable to all patriotic scientists and educators! It is also absolutely unacceptable to the comrades of our Jiusan Society! We must follow what Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, draw a clear line between ourselves and the rightists politically and ideologically, and carry out necessary and resolute struggles against them.

It is obvious that the various fallacies of the rightists echo each other and speak for the hostile classes. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country have full confidence and strength to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists. The rightists should honestly admit their mistakes to the people, honestly explain their problems, and accept transformation. If they persist in their reactionary stance, resist transformation, and even sabotage socialist construction, then they will cut themselves off from the people.

	Jiusan Society members are fighting against the fallacies of rightists such as Chu Anping and Gu Zhizhong.

In the process of helping the Party to rectify its work, the vast majority of Jiusan Society members, in the spirit of loving the Party, put forward many useful opinions. However, among the members, there was a rightist like Chu Anping who openly published the fallacy of the so-called "Party's world" to slander the Party's leadership and竄改竄改竄改竄改竄改 the political direction of the Guangming Daily, the organ of the democratic parties, making this newspaper once become a bourgeois newspaper and a tool for the rightist ambitionists to oppose the Party. There was also Gu Zhizhong who published slanderous remarks against our country's legal system, slanderous remarks against the People's Daily, and other absurd remarks. In addition, some members in various regions also published some erroneous remarks. This shows that our work has not been done well, we have relaxed the ideological education of our members, and due to our dull political sense, we have lost the due vigilance against rightist ideas and various erroneous remarks. This is very painful.

Now, the Jiusan Society has begun its internal rectification, and the vast majority of members have invested in the rectification movement with great enthusiasm, and are carrying out a resolute struggle against the rightists and all erroneous remarks. However, some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of the rectification, so their fighting spirit is not strong enough, and they even show right-leaning emotions more or less. We must recognize that this anti-rightist struggle is a struggle between two roads. In this struggle, we must firmly stand our ground and actively join the battle. We intellectuals from the old society have made certain progress through study and transformation in the past few years, and some people have become intellectuals of the working people. However, it is undeniable that in the minds of many old intellectuals, there are still varying degrees of bourgeois "democratic" ideas. Some of us are not so easy to accept democratic centralism, are not so accustomed to the socialist system, and also have鬆勁鬆勁鬆勁鬆勁鬆勁 ideas about studying Marxism-Leninism and carrying out self-transformation. When our socialist cause is constantly advancing, we must overcome these erroneous ideas, continue to carry out self-transformation, actively and conscientiously participate in the internal rectification of the society, draw a clear political and ideological line between ourselves and the rightists and right-wing remarks, carry out a resolute struggle against them, and strictly examine our own thoughts to further improve ourselves. At the same time, we will continue to help the Chinese Communist Party rectify its work in order to overcome shortcomings and improve its work.

We believe that through this anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people of the whole country will be further enhanced, our country's people's democratic system will be further consolidated, and our socialist construction will achieve greater victories. All the comrades of our Jiusan Society will unswervingly follow the Communist Party forever and will always be loyal to the socialist cause.

    党能够领导科学文教事业
    许德珩的发言
    这次代表大会是在我国第一个五年计划即将胜利完成的前夜召开的。在开会以前，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演正式发表了。这是照耀全国人民胜利前进的又一明灯。我们对这一讲演进行了多次的学习，今后还要继续深入地学习，从这里吸取巨大的力量，更好地为人民服务。
    开会以来，听到了周总理的“政府工作报告”以及其他各项工作报告，我完全同意并拥护这些报告。周总理这个具有历史意义的报告，根据毛主席讲演所提出的原则，总结了过去几年来我国在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的成绩、缺点和经验教训，指出了我们继续前进的具体方针，肯定了全国人民在共产党领导下所取得的辉煌成就，并且严正地批判了资产阶级右派分子反党反社会主义的反动言论，有力地捍卫了我国人民的利益，对社会主义建设和社会主义改造加强了无比的力量。
     右派分子妄图动摇国  本、破坏宪法，全国人民绝不答应
    中国共产党为着更好地领导和团结全国人民从事社会主义建设，从五月初起，开展了党内整风运动，并且邀请党外人士帮助党整风。全国各阶层人民，包括民主党派成员在内，绝大多数本着爱党的精神，从团结的愿望出发，提出意见，帮助党整风，改进工作。党在整风过程中，贯彻了边整边改的精神，倾听群众的意见，提出了改进的办法，尽可能立即实行。这说明中国共产党是何等大公无私，虚怀若谷，说明党和人民是如何的血肉相连。可以预料，整风的目的是完全可以胜利达到的。
    但是，在整风过程中，竟出现了一股歪风，右派野心分子利用整风的机会，向党猖狂进攻。他们故意夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，把个别地方个别成员的缺点或错误，说成是整个党的缺点或错误，以混淆是非，颠倒黑白，并且捏造事实，肆意诽谤，把我们社会主义事业在前进中难以避免的某些缺点，或者个别成员作风上的某些毛病，说成是社会主义制度或人民民主制度的产物，企图达到他们否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义道路，使资本主义在中国复辟的可耻目的。他们说：“‘党天下’是产生宗派主义的最终根源”，“官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义的根源是无产阶级专政”，“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”，这不是企图否定党的领导，推翻人民民主专政（无产阶级专政）是什么？他们说：“资产阶级没有两面性”，“工人阶级分子和资产阶级分子没有本质的差别”，“定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获”，这样用尽心机来美化资本主义，并且拒绝对资产阶级分子的改造，这不是企图使资本主义在中国复辟是什么？右派野心分子甚至提出所谓“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”等荒谬主张，妄想改变我国现行的政治制度，用资本主义“民主”来代替社会主义民主。他们中间某些人还疯狂地叫嚣要共产党“下台”，“共产党不来领导，人家也不会卖国”。右派野心分子各种反党、反对人民民主制度、反对社会主义的荒谬言论，已经激起了全国人民的无比愤怒。经历了千辛万苦获得胜利的中国人民，一定要像保护自己的眼珠一样，保护领导我们的核心力量——中国共产党，保护我们革命的胜利果实——人民民主制度和社会主义制度。共产党的领导，人民民主专政，社会主义道路，已经载入宪法，为全国人民所共同遵守。右派野心分子妄想动摇国本，破坏庄严的宪法，全国人民绝不答应！我们九三学社的同志也绝不答应！右派野心分子应该知道，你们的荒谬言论只有台湾和香港的反动报刊在为你们喝采，把你们看作是他们的“志士”、“仁人”，要用一切力量来支援你们。你们到底代表谁说话，为谁说话，这难道不是很明白吗？
      人民的科学文教事业的领导权不容许侵夺
    右派野心分子还散布各种荒谬言论来在知识分子中间寻找市场，向科学文教机关党的领导进攻。有的人说：党不能领导科学。有的人说：中国科学事业在解放后比国民党时代落后了，今后十二年不是赶上国际水平的问题，而是补过去十二年课的问题。有的人认为科学事业不可能作出全国性的长期的规划，只能由科学家自发地、分散地进行。他们更荒谬地认为国务院科学规划委员会的存在是不信任中国科学家的表现。有的人抹煞解放后高等学校院系调整和教学改革的成绩，否定党对学校教育的领导，否定在学校中进行政治思想教育的必要性，叫喊党退出学校，取消学校中的政治课。有的人还提出了所谓“民主办校”的方案和“教授治校”的主张。我们坚决反对这种破坏人民的科学文教事业的右派言论，坚决反对右派野心分子妄想夺取科学文教事业的领导权的可耻阴谋。我们认为，用马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国共产党，不但领导中国人民取得了新民主主义革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，也一定能够胜利地领导科学，领导国家的文化教育事业。事实上，解放后八年来我们科学文教事业所取得的成就，是中国历史上任何年代所不能比拟的。这就是党领导的结果。解放以来，党和政府对科学家和文教工作者给予无限的关怀、支持和帮助，使他们感到英雄有用武之地，感到自己的工作不但有意义，而且有力量，从而在工作中发挥了积极性。新中国的科学文教事业，是要为人民服务、为社会主义服务的，假如没有共产党的领导，没有马克思列宁主义的思想武装，它究竟为谁服务？是不是为资本主义服务？那全国人民是绝对不能答应的！一切爱国的科学家、教育家是绝对不能答应的！我们九三学社的同志也是绝对不能答应的！我们一定要遵照周总理在他的报告中所指出的，在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，并对他们进行必要的坚决的斗争。
    目前右派分子各种谬论互相呼应，为敌对阶级张目，是显而易见的。全国人民在共产党的领导下，有充分的信心和力量来粉碎右派分子的一切阴谋诡计。右派分子应该老老实实地向人民认错，诚实地交代问题，接受改造。如果坚持反动的立场，抗拒改造，甚至破坏社会主义建设的行动，那么，他们将自绝于人民。
      九三学社成员正同储安平、顾执中等右派的谬论进行斗争
    在帮助党整风的过程中，九三学社绝大多数社员本着热爱党的精神，提出了许多有益的意见。但在社员中，竟有储安平这样的右派分子公然发表了所谓“党天下”的谬论，来诽谤党的领导，并且窜改了民主党派机关报——光明日报的政治方向，使这个报纸曾经一度变成为资产阶级的报纸，成为右派野心家反党的工具。还有顾执中发表了诬蔑我国法制、诬蔑人民日报以及其他荒谬言论；另外，各地区也还有社员发表了某些错误言论。这说明我们的工作没有做好，我们放松了对成员的思想教育工作；由于我们的政治嗅觉不灵，对于右派思想和各种错误言论失去了应有的警惕，这是非常痛咎的。
    现在，九三学社已经开始社内整风，绝大多数社员都以很高的热情投入了整风运动，对右派分子和一切错误言论正在进行着坚决的斗争。但有的同志对整风的重大意义还认识不足，因而斗志不够旺盛，甚至或多或少地表现右倾情绪。我们要认清这一次反右派斗争是两条道路的斗争，在这一斗争中，必须坚决地站稳立场，积极地投身战斗。我们从旧社会来的知识分子，这几年来经过学习和改造，已经有了一定的进步，一部分人已经成为劳动人民的知识分子。但毋庸讳言，在很多旧知识分子头脑中，还存在着程度不同的资产阶级“民主”思想。我们有些人对于民主集中制还不是那么容易接受，对于社会主义制度还不是那么习惯，对于学习马克思列宁主义和进行自我改造也还有松劲思想。当我们的社会主义事业不断前进的时候，我们必须克服这些错误思想，继续进行自我改造，积极地、认真地参加社内整风，同右派分子和右派言论划清政治和思想界限，对他们进行坚决的斗争，并且严格地检查自己的思想，进一步提高自己。同时，继续帮助中国共产党整风，以克服缺点，改进工作。
    我们相信，通过这次反右派斗争和整风运动，全国广大人民的社会主义觉悟将进一步提高，我国人民民主制度将获得进一步的巩固，我们的社会主义建设事业将取得更伟大的胜利。我们九三学社全体同志坚定不移地永远跟着共产党走，永远尽忠于社会主义事业。
