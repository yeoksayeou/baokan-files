    Although the British general election is still three years away, the Conservative Party leader, disturbed by the large loss of votes in recent local and by-elections, has decided to place huge advertisements in some newspapers every Sunday to promote the Conservative Party. These advertisements will run until 1960, with advertising costs reaching 50,000 pounds per year.

    英国保守党的“广告”
    虽然现在离英国大选尚有三年的时间，但保守党领袖由于对最近的地方选举和补缺选举中大量丧失选票感到不安，因此决定每星期天在一些报纸上登载巨幅广告，来为保守党作宣传。这种广告将一直登到1960年，广告费每年达五万英镑。
