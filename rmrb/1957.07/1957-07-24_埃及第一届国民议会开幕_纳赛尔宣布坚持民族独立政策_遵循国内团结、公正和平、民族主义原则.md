Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 23rd: Egyptian President Nasser announced on the 22nd that Egypt will adhere to the principles of non-alignment and Arab nationalism in its foreign policy.

Nasser delivered a policy address at the opening session of the first National Assembly established after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. He said that Egypt's policy is based on three principles: domestic unity—unity for active engagement and anticipation of the future; justice—seeking a just peace and not joining any of the two blocs; and Arab nationalism—a means of defending the borders of Egypt and the Arab world.

In his two-hour speech, he said that the revolution has paved the way for a sound democratic life by abolishing occupation, eliminating feudalism, freeing the government system from the control of capital, eliminating social injustices, and establishing a strong national army.

Referring to the achievements made domestically in the past five years, Nasser said that out of the 800,000 acres of land to be distributed, 282,650 acres have been allocated to 68,737 families, totaling 466,495 people. Egypt's food imports have decreased, and exports have increased. Egypt's agricultural income has increased from 252 million Egyptian pounds in 1952-1953 to 313 million Egyptian pounds in 1955-1956. Industrial production has increased by an average of 10% annually. After the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, this percentage will increase significantly.

He said that in education, a total of 1,230 schools have been built in the past five years, an average of 247 schools per year, compared to only three schools built in the year before the revolution. This year's education budget is 45 million pounds, compared to 26 million pounds in the first year after the revolution.

He revealed that plans have been made to carry out the first phase of construction of the Aswan High Dam, which will be completed in five years at a cost of 60 million pounds. This will create one million feddans (one feddan equals 6.3 mu) of new agricultural land, and will also transform 700,000 feddans of basin land into land that can be irrigated year-round.

Thus, the agricultural portion of Egypt's national income will increase by no less than 25% compared to today's income.

Nasser also reviewed Egypt's struggle to maintain its independence in the face of pressure from imperialist countries. He said that these struggles include the struggle against attempts to drag Egypt into military treaties, the struggle against Israeli threats, the struggle against arms monopolies, the struggle to safeguard Egypt's right as an international entity and to play an independent role in international affairs, as demonstrated by Egypt's participation in the Bandung Conference, the struggle against economic pressure after the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and resistance to armed aggression. He said that Egypt has won all these battles.

Nasser said, "Without mentioning any of the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, the mere holding of it is a major turning point in history." International conferences such as the Brioni Conference, in which Egypt later participated, were facilitated by the resolutions of the Bandung Conference in one aspect or another. Nasser pointed out that the dangers that have been repelled still exist. These dangers are: first, the attack on Syria, which is also an attack on Arab nationalism; second, the issue of freezing sterling balances; third, the propaganda war against Egypt; fourth, the war of nerves; fifth, openly talking about isolating the Egyptian people from other Arab peoples, and efforts to destroy Arab nationalism. He said that Egypt is racing against time and it must win this race.

    埃及第一届国民议会开幕
    纳赛尔宣布坚持民族独立政策
    遵循国内团结、公正和平、民族主义原则
    据新华社开罗23日电　埃及总统纳赛尔22日宣布，埃及在外交政策方面将坚持不参加集团和阿拉伯民族主义的原则。
    纳赛尔在1952年埃及革命以后成立的第一届国民议会的开幕会议上发表政策演说。他说，埃及的政策是以三项原则为基础的。这三项原则是：国内的团结——团结起来积极活动和期待着将来；公正——寻求公正的和平，不参加两个集团中任何一个集团；以及阿拉伯民族主义——保卫埃及和阿拉伯的边界的手段。
    他在历时两小时的演说中说，由于取消了占领，消灭了封建主义，使政府制度解除了资本的统治，消除了社会的不公平现象和建立了一支强大的民族陆军，革命已经为健全的民主生活铺平了道路。
    纳赛尔在谈到过去五年在国内取得的成就时说，在要分配的八十万英亩土地中间，到现在为止已有二十八万二千六百五十英亩分配给了共有四十六万六千四百九十五人的六万八千七百三十七户人家。埃及进口的粮食已经减少，出口增加了。埃及的农业收入已经从1952—1953年的二亿五千二百万埃镑增加到1955—1956年的三亿一千三百万埃镑。工业产量每年平均增加10％。在执行五年计划以后，这种百分比将大大增加。
    他说，在教育方面，过去五年一共建立了一千二百三十所学校，平均每年建立二百四十七所，而在革命以前的那一年只建立了三所。今年的教育经费有四千五百万镑，而革命后的第一年是二千六百万镑。
    他透露，已经制定了进行阿斯旺高水坝第一期建设工作的计划，这将在五年内完成，费用是六千万镑。这样就会出现一百万费丹（一费丹合六点三市亩）的新农业土地，另外将把七十万费丹的盆地变为一年四季都能得到灌溉的土地。
    这样，埃及国民收入中农业部分的收入会比今天的收入增加不下25％。
    纳赛尔还回顾了埃及在面临帝国主义国家压力的情况下为了维护它的独立而进行的斗争。他说，这些斗争就是反对企图把埃及拖进军事条约的斗争，反对以色列威胁的斗争，反对武器垄断的斗争，像埃及参加万隆会议所表现的那种维护埃及作为国际实体的权利和在国际事务中担任独立角色的斗争，在苏伊士运河国有化之后对抗经济压力的斗争以及抵抗武装侵略。他说，埃及已经取得了所有这些战斗的胜利。
    纳赛尔说，“不谈万隆会议的任何决议，单单是它的召开就是历史上一个重要的转折点。”如像埃及后来曾参加过的布里俄尼会议这样的一些国际会议都是在这方面或那方面由万隆会议的决议所促成的。纳赛尔指出，已经被击退的危险仍然存在。这些危险是：一，对叙利亚的攻击，也就是针对着阿拉伯民族主义的攻击；二，冻结英镑余额的问题；三，反对埃及的宣传战；四，神经战；五，公然谈论把埃及人民从其它阿拉伯人民中孤立起来，以及努力摧毁阿拉伯民族主义。他说，埃及是在同时间赛跑，而且它必须赢得这场比赛。
