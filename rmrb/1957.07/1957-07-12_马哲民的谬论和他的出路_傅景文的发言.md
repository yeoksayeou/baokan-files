I completely agree with and support the Premier's Government Work Report and all other reports of the Congress.

Since the start of the Party's rectification movement, the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks in Beijing and Wuhan have been "interconnected and closely linked," forming what right-wingers consider a "torrent" to launch a presumptuous attack on the Communist Party. Mr. Ma Zhimin is the authoritative spokesperson for the right-wing elements stationed in Wuhan.

Ma Zhimin's Various Fallacies

What views has Mr. Ma Zhimin expressed? Let us review them.

I. Exaggerating shortcomings, distorting facts, and slandering the Party's leadership. Mr. Ma Zhimin said that the Party's suppression of counter-revolutionaries was: "Considering those who grumble as being anti-Party, and being anti-Party is being counter-revolutionary. This is a murderous logic." His attitude towards the Party's rectification was: telling the masses, "Whatever the Party likes, hate it; whatever the Party hates, like it." "We must break free from concerns and speak out boldly, even if we call an elephant's trunk a bamboo tube." He believed that "The Wuhan's 'blooming and contending' cannot be carried out because it is led by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, and the leaders of the Provincial Committee cannot get their thinking straight first."

II. Opposing the Party's leadership. Mr. Ma Zhimin said, "The school's Party committee system will be abolished soon, and veteran cadres will withdraw from the school." "The Party committee system cannot be abolished without convincing the stubborn elements within the Party." "The Communist Party will perish without the help of the democratic parties." He said, "Institutions of higher learning can be completely taken over by the China Democratic League." "Intellectuals should cross over on the boat of the China Democratic League." He also said, "The Party cannot lead the rectification; the China Democratic League must take the initiative, pressing from above and squeezing from within. If we seek the Party's opinion everywhere, it will not work."

III. Insulting Party members and Party cadres. Mr. Ma Zhimin said, "Party members are all wooden people, without brains." He also said, "Old Party members have low cultural levels, understand nothing, and are experienced in subjectivism in thinking and guerrilla warfare in administrative work; new Party members who are intellectuals lack practical experience and are dogmatic. The combination of these two types of people becomes the Communist Party's Marxism-Leninism."

Delegates! I want to ask Mr. Ma Zhimin a few questions: First, Mr. Ma Zhimin has always liked to grumble. If we follow your "logic" of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, can you, as a People's Representative, still hold your position? Can your head still remain on your neck? Second, did Wuhan's "blooming and contending" really not get started? Then, Mr. Ma Zhimin, please answer a question: Under your guidance, the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law sent twenty representatives (two teachers, eighteen students) to Beijing to petition; did the Provincial Committee stop them? I also ask you to answer a question: Under the ideological guidance of your attempt to distort the facts, what did you "bloom" and what did you "contend?" What was your intention in sending the Hubei Provincial Democratic League's work report, full of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks, to major universities and colleges in the Wuhan area? Third, if you do not want the Communist Party's leadership, who do you want to lead? Professor, who claims to be a Marxist-Leninist, don't you even understand the simple theory that Lenin spoke of, that the ultimate goal of the proletarian revolution is to seize power? Mr. Ma Zhimin shouts "Long live the Communist Party" and wants to follow the Communist Party all day long. Is the Party you support the one you describe as a complete mess?

These are Mr. Ma Zhimin's so-called "Marxist-Leninist" viewpoints. Unfortunately, I cannot distinguish what essential differences these viewpoints have from the "political design institute," "rehabilitation committee," and "saying achievements are the main thing is dogmatism" spoken by some right-wing leaders.

For More Than Twenty Years, Ma Zhimin Has Never Considered Betraying the Revolution as Shameful

Why are the remarks of right-wing elements all interconnected? We must not be deceived by their sweet words. Their remarks are by no means "accidental coincidences" but have "intentions" today and "origins" in the past. If we open the family trees of right-wing elements and check their history, right-wing elements and traitors to the people seem to be inseparable forever. They are either traitors to the Communist Party or traitors to the democratic parties. For example, Mr. Ma Zhimin left the Communist Party during the Great Revolution, left the China Democratic League during the anti-communist upsurge of the Kuomintang during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and even wrote a letter to Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing under the Kuomintang, saying: "The headquarters of the China Democratic League has been disbanded, and I am no longer involved." For more than twenty years, Mr. Ma Zhimin has always remembered his philosophy of life of "retreating when knowing it's difficult, being greedy for life and afraid of death." They are not ashamed of betraying the revolution but are proud of it. There is also a set of "theories" formed by traitors themselves, saying: "In the past, some Party members left the Party, and the responsibility did not lie with the Party members but with the Party." If that were really the case, then traitors would not have to be spurned by the people! I suggest that the history of all right-wing elements be checked. Although the Party's policy has repeatedly stated that past mistakes will not be held against them, I think this refers to those who sincerely repent, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, offset their crimes with meritorious service, and confess to the people. Those who persist in reactionary positions and are sworn enemies of the people cannot be spared, but must be held accountable.

Ma Zhimin Confronts Criticism with a Rude and Denying Attitude

The delegates of the Hubei delegation, based on the principle of curing the illness to save the patient, put forward many concerned opinions to Mr. Ma Zhimin. Mr. Ma Zhimin is a People's Representative. How can all the delegates watch someone who was once a fellow traveler of the people now take the road against the people and not save him? But unfortunately, let's see how Mr. Ma Zhimin treats the delegates' care and help.

It seems that Mr. Ma Zhimin is humbly making self-criticism. No one can deny that he requested to speak four times in the panel discussion and said that he would correct his mistakes and follow the Communist Party forever. But let's see how he is following. Mr. Ma Zhimin's attitude towards self-criticism is: self-praise, saying the good but not the bad, saying the public but not the secret, and saying that all erroneous viewpoints are not his own ideas but are due to a lack of political vigilance, leading him to become a megaphone for right-wing elements. Delegates! A university professor who claims to be a "Marxist-Leninist," the current president of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, and the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Democratic League, has neither his own position nor the ability to distinguish right from wrong. I think this kind of self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist can only be self-made. How does Mr. Ma Zhimin treat the delegates' sincere help to him? He divided the people who gave him opinions into types. He said: "The people who attacked me this time can be divided into four types: First, those who made mistakes in the movement and tried to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes and shift the blame to others, such as Zhu Yubi, the president of Hubei Medical College; second, those who were originally dissatisfied with me and tried to retaliate, such as the members of the China Democratic League branch of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, because I used to look down on them and did not contact them; third, those who had close contact with me in the past and knew my situation relatively well, and tried to put forward opinions to clear themselves; fourth, those who generally express their attitudes, wave flags and shout slogans, and echo others (we believe this essentially refers to workers, peasants, and students), these are unimportant." Regarding Representative Li Da's speech, he thought it made him extremely embarrassed and said: "How could I say that the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the People's Daily editorial were dogmatic? Representative Li Da also understands some problems in his own mind." He also made the following evaluation of the opinions raised to him, saying: "The materials published in Hubei Daily and Changjiang Daily are all attacking me, and those people are all fabricating rumors and slandering me." "The grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League in Wuhan are impure and may have counter-revolutionary elements." His attitude towards accepting everyone's criticism is: when there is both human and material evidence and there is no way to quibble, he says it is "taking things out of context"; when there is material evidence but no one present, he says it is rumor-mongering; when the criticism is sharp, he says: "I have no opinion, I will say whatever the Party tells me to say, if the Party wants me to go to jail, I will go to jail, if it wants me to die, I will die." He uses the method of denial to confront the people. He also said: "After this movement, I will learn to be vigilant in the future." I want to ask Mr. Ma Zhimin, who do you want to be vigilant against? Against the people? Or against the enemy?

There are Only Two Paths in Front of the Right-Wing Elements, They Should Choose Wisely

Delegates! Are our criticisms of Mr. Ma Zhimin really taking things out of context or fabricating rumors and slanders? Which of the four types should we belong to? I know that Zhu Yubi did express many anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks in Hubei during the "blooming and contending," and this must and will be severely refuted by the people. However, criticizing and exposing Ma Zhimin's mistakes is good and is by no means what Mr. Ma Zhimin calls "shifting the blame to others."

We will not forget that right-wing elements are always persisting in their reactionary anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist positions. Some of them blatantly resist the opinions from the masses, while others appear to be very honest on the surface but are very cunning in their hearts. Despite this, the Party and the people are still waiting for them and welcome them to repent and start anew. Today, there are only two paths in front of the right-wing elements: one is to rein in at the brink of the precipice, start a new life, and confess to the people. The people will forgive you, welcome you, and the Party will welcome you; the other is to persist in the reactionary position, persist in mistakes, and isolate yourselves from the people. Which path do you want to take? You can think carefully and choose for yourselves.

### 马哲民的谬论和他的出路  傅景文的发言

    马哲民的谬论和他的出路
    傅景文的发言
    我完全同意并拥护总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。
    党的整风运动开始以来，北京——武汉的反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论，“一脉相传，息息相通”的，连成了一条右派分子们认为的“洪流”，向共产党展开了狂妄的进攻。马哲民先生就是驻武汉市右派分子的权威发言人。
    马哲民的谬论种种
    马哲民先生曾经发表过些什么见解呢？让我们回顾一下。
    一、夸大缺点，歪曲事实，诬蔑党的领导。马哲民先生说党的肃反运动是：“把发发牢骚的，就认为是反党，反党就是反革命，这是一种杀人逻辑”。对待党整风的态度是：向群众说：“整风中党之所好则恶之，党之所恶则好之。”“要打破顾虑，大胆鸣放，那怕把象鼻子说成竹筒子也是可以的。”他认为：“武汉鸣放搞不起来，就因为鸣放由中共湖北省委领导的，而省委领导人首先就思想搞不通。”
    二、反对党的领导。马哲民先生说：“学校党委制马上要取消了，老干部要退出学校。”“党委制不取消就无法说服党内顽固派。”“共产党没有民主党派的帮助就要灭亡。”他说：“高等学校可以由民盟一手包办。”“知识分子过渡要坐民盟的船。”还说：“党不能领导整风，民盟要争取主动，必须上下压，内外挤，如果处处征求党的意见，那就搞不成。”
    三、侮辱党员和党的干部。马哲民先生说：“党员都是木头人，没有脑筋。”又说：“老党员文化水平低，什么也不懂，思想上是经验主义，行政工作上是游击主义；知识分子新党员缺乏实际，是教条主义。两种人相结合就成了共产党的马列主义。”
    代表们！我要向马哲民先生提出几个问题：第一，马哲民先生一贯是喜欢发牢骚的，如果按照你说的肃反“逻辑”，那么你这个人民代表是不是还能当？你的脑袋是否还能留在脖子上？第二，武汉鸣放真的没有搞起来吗？那么马哲民先生，请你回答一个问题，中南财经学院在你的指导下，派来二十个代表（二个老师，十八个学生）到北京请愿，省委阻止过没有？还要请你回答一个问题，在你的企图歪曲事实的思想指导下，你们鸣了些什么？放了些什么？你把湖北省民盟的充满反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论的工作简报，发往武汉地区各大专学校的企图又是什么？第三，不要共产党的领导”你要谁来领导？自称为马列主义者的大学教授先生，难道你对列宁讲过的，无产阶级革命的最终目的是为了夺取政权，这条朴实的理论也不了解吗？马哲民先生整天口头上喊着共产党万岁，要跟着共产党走，难道你所拥护的竟是像你所说的一团糟的党吗？
    这些就是马哲民先生自己所谓的“马列主义”的论点，可惜的是我分辨不出来这些论点与某些右派分子的头子们所说的“政治设计院”，“平反委员会”，“说成绩是主要的就是教条主义”等有什么本质上的区别呢？
    二十多年来马哲民从不以叛变革命为可耻
    为什么右派分子们的言论都是一脉相传呢？我们不要被他们的花言巧语所蒙蔽，他们的言论决不是“偶然的巧合”，而是今天有“企图”，过去有“渊源”的。不信我们翻开右派分子们的家谱，查一查他们的历史，右派分子与人民的叛徒好像永远是密不可分的，他们不是共产党的叛徒就是民主党派的叛徒。比如马哲民先生，大革命时期脱离了共产党，抗战时期国民党反共高潮的时候脱离了民盟，在重庆还曾给国民党重庆市长张笃伦写过信，说：“民盟总部解散了，我现在不干了。”二十多年来，每当紧要关头，马哲民先生都切记他自己的“知难而退，贪生怕死”的处世哲学，他们并不以叛变革命为耻，反以为荣。还有一套叛徒们自成一家的“理论”，说：“过去有些党员脱党，其责任不在党员，在于党。”假如真的是这样，那么，叛徒就不必遭到人民的唾弃啦！我建议把所有右派分子的历史查一查，虽然党的政策一再提出既往不咎，我认为这是指那些诚意悔过、戴罪立功、将功折罪、向人民认罪的人是可以既往不咎，而对那些坚持反动立场、誓与人民为敌的就不能是不咎而是必咎。
    马哲民以横蛮抵赖的态度来对抗批评
    湖北代表组的代表们，本着治病救人的方针，对马哲民先生提出了很多关切的意见，马哲民先生是人民代表，全体代表们怎么能看着过去曾经做过人民的同路人今天走向反人民的道路，而见死不救呢？而可惜，大家看一看马哲民先生又是如何对待代表们的关心和帮助？
    看起来马哲民先生好像是在虚心地作自我检讨，谁也不能否认他在小组会上四次要求发言，还说要改正错误，要永远跟着共产党走。可是我们再看看他是如何在走呢？马哲民先生自我检讨的态度是：自我吹嘘，说好不说坏，说公开的不说秘密的，所有错误的论点都不是主见，而是政治警惕性不高，以致作了右派分子的传声筒。代表们！一个自命为“马列主义者”的大学教授，今天中南财经学院的院长，湖北省民盟的主任委员，竟至既无自己的立场，又无鉴别是非的能力，我看这种自命的马列主义者也只能是自成一家的了。马哲民先生又是如何对待代表们对他衷心的帮助呢？他把给他提意见的人分出了类型，他说：“这次攻击我的人可以分四种类型：一是自己在运动中犯了错误，企图戴罪立功，嫁祸于人的，如湖北省医学院院长朱裕璧；二是原来对我不满，企图打击报复的，如中南财经学院的民盟支部成员，因为过去我瞧不起他们，不与他们接触；三是过去与我交往甚密，对我的情况也比较了解的，企图提出意见洗刷自己；四是一般表表态度，摇旗呐喊，随声附和的（我们认为实质上是指工人、农民、学生），这些无关紧要。”对李达代表的发言，认为是把他搞得焦头烂额，还说：“我怎么会说论无产阶级专政的历史经验和人民日报社论都是教条主义呢？李达的发言有些问题他自己思想里也明白的。”他又把给他提出的意见作了这样的评价，说：“湖北日报、长江日报上登的材料都是攻击我的，那些人都是造谣诽谤的。”“武汉民盟基层组织不纯，可能有反革命分子。”对接受大家批评的态度是：人证物证俱在无法狡辩时说是“断章取义”；有物无人说是造谣；批评尖锐了就说：“我没有主张了，党叫我怎么说就怎么说，要我坐牢就坐牢，要我死就死。”用抵赖的办法来对抗人民。他还说：“经过这次运动，今后要学会警惕。”我要问问马哲民先生，要对谁提高警惕？是对人民？还是对敌人？
    右派分子面前只有两条出路，应善自选择
    代表们！我们对马哲民先生提出批评真的不是断章取义就是造谣诬蔑吗？我们自己应该属于四种类型中的那一种类型呢？我知道，湖北在鸣放中，朱裕璧的确放过不少反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论，这是必须也一定会遭到人民严肃的驳斥的。但是，对马哲民的错误进行批评和揭发是好的，决不是马哲民先生所谓的“嫁祸于人”。
    我们不会忘记，右派分子们随时都在坚持自己反党、反人民、反社会主义的反动立场，他们有的人明目张胆的抗拒来自人民群众的意见，有的人表面看来似乎很老实，心里却很狡猾。尽管这样，党和人民还是在等待他们，欢迎他们悔过自新。今天摆在右派分子们面前的只有两条道路：一条是悬崖勒马，重新做人，向人民认罪，人民会宽恕你们、欢迎你们，党会欢迎你们；一条是坚持反动立场，坚持错误，自外于人民。你们愿意走那一条路？可以深思熟虑，自己选择。
