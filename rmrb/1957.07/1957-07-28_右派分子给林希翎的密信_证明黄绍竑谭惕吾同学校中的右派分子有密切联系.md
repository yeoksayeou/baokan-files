Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: During today's plenary session of the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Hu Xikui, Vice President of the Renmin University of China, publicly read a secret letter written to Lin Xiling by three rightists using pseudonyms. This secret letter proves that Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu had close ties with rightists in Beijing universities.

In his speech, Hu Xikui pointed out that bourgeois rightists launched attacks on Beijing universities through several lines, and Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu were important links. He said that Tan Tiwu, who was famous for starting her career by opposing the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, colluded with Huang Shaohong, known for his ruthless killings, to directly incite trouble in Beijing universities. They not only contacted rightists such as Lin Xiling at Renmin University, but also had connections with rightists in universities such as Peking University and Beijing Normal University. Many rightists frequently went in and out of Tan Tiwu's home.

Hu Xikui said that while teachers and students of Renmin University were criticizing Lin Xiling, Lin Xiling received a secret letter on June 26th from three people using the pseudonyms Ai Lin, etc. Hu Xikui read the letter on the spot. The letter wrote to Lin Xiling: "Seeing that Renmin University is holding a debate with 6,000 people for you, we are very worried that you will become a surrender general." "We support you, ten thousand times support you. To make a joke, if you really go to jail, we will definitely bring you food. You must anticipate that these people are making a mountain out of a molehill. Just think, didn't Mr. Hu Feng suffer from this?" "Regarding Mr. Tan Tiwu and Mr. Huang Shaohong, we hope you will not mention them again. Of course, if you are afraid of going to jail, afraid of these six thousand or sixty thousand people, and push the responsibility onto Mr. Tan and Mr. Huang, that would be another matter. But that is the act of a petty person and is very shameful. We believe you will not do that. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, we met with Mr. Tan. She thinks you are 'loose-lipped' and speak with 'hints.' Therefore, we ask you to be calm. We are students, and it doesn't matter if we have more sins, if it can be called a sin. But Mr. Tan and Mr. Huang are different. It is easy to associate them with historical problems from a century ago, which is extremely annoying." The letter concluded by saying, "We can still see Mr. Tan, and we will pass on any messages." Hu Xikui said that this proves that Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu were conducting a conspiracy in many universities in Beijing, and we demand that Tan Tiwu make a thorough confession to the people at the meeting.

    右派分子给林希翎的密信
    证明黄绍竑谭惕吾同学校中的右派分子有密切联系
    据新华社27日讯　在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议的今天大会讨论中，中国人民大学副校长胡锡奎当众宣读了三个化名的右派分子写给林希翎的一封密信。这封密信证明黄绍竑、谭惕吾和北京市高等学校中的右派分子是有密切的联系的。
    胡锡奎在讲话中指出：资产阶级右派分子向北京高等学校进攻是有几条线的，而黄绍竑、谭惕吾是一条重要的线。他说，以反共反苏起家驰名的谭惕吾，勾通了以杀人不眨眼著称的黄绍竑直接在北京高等院校点火，他们不但在人民大学和右派分子林希翎联系，而且与北京大学、北京师范大学等高等学校的右派分子也有联系。谭惕吾家里经常有许多右派分子进进出出。
    胡锡奎说，在人民大学师生们批判林希翎时，林希翎在6月26日收到了一封化名艾林等三人的密信。胡锡奎当场读了这封信。信里对林希翎写道：“看到人民大学为你举办六千人的辩论会，我们很耽心你做投降将军”“我们支持你，一万个支持你，说句笑话，如果你真坐牢，我们一定给你送饭，你不能不预料到，这些小题大作的先生们，试想胡风先生不正是受此害吗？”“关于谭惕吾先生和黄绍竑先生希你不要再提，当然如果你害怕坐牢，害怕这六千人六万人，把责任推到谭黄两先生身上，那就是另外一回事了。不过这是小人之辈的勾当，是很可耻的，我们相信你不会这样做的。在昨天上午十点钟，我们会见了谭先生，她认为你“口松”，说话有“引子”，海果，我们请求你冷静些。我们是学生，多些罪没有关系，如果可以说成罪的话。而谭先生和黄先生却不然，对他们很容易扯上一世纪以前的历史问题，这是顶讨厌的”。信中最后说，“我们还能见到谭先生，有事我们转达。”胡锡奎说，由此可以证明黄绍竑、谭惕吾两人在北京许多高等学校中进行一种阴谋活动，我们要求谭惕吾在大会上彻底向人民交代。
