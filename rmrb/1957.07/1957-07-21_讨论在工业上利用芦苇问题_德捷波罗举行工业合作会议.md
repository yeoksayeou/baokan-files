Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 20th: According to the Romanian News Agency, representatives from East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania held an industrial cooperation conference in Bucharest from July 8th to 17th to discuss the industrial utilization of reeds from the Danube Delta.

The conference discussed technical issues related to fiber production and foreign trade, and resolved many practical issues related to the construction of a fiber joint enterprise in Braila, eastern Romania. Experts from the participating countries believe that reeds are a valuable raw material that can be used in the paper and textile industries of the relevant countries. Representatives of the participating countries signed a protocol on further cooperation between the countries.

Reeds are one of Romania's main resources and have extremely wide applications in Romania's building materials industry. The fiber factory to be built in Braila will also use reeds to manufacture various fibers, paperboard, plywood, and the like. Romania, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland had already begun preparations for scientific and technological cooperation in this area three years ago.

    讨论在工业上利用芦苇问题
    德捷波罗举行工业合作会议
    新华社布加勒斯特20日电　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道，民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和罗马尼亚四国的代表，从7月8日到17日在布加勒斯特举行工业合作会议，讨论在工业中利用多瑙河三角洲上的芦苇的问题。
    会议讨论了有关纤维的生产技术以及对外贸易方面的问题，解决了有关在罗马尼亚东部的布莱拉建设纤维联合企业的许多实际问题。参加会议的各国专家认为，芦苇是一种价值很高的原料，可供有关各国的造纸和纺织工业应用。与会各国代表就各国进一步合作的问题签订了议定书。
    芦苇是罗马尼亚的主要富源之一，它在罗马尼亚的建筑材料工业部门有着极其广泛的用途。在布莱拉兴建的纤维工厂还将用芦苇制造各种纤维、纸板和胶合品等。罗马尼亚同民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰早在三年前就已经开始了在这方面进行科学技术合作的筹备工作。
