Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. Beijing theatrical figures are criticizing Wu Zuguang’s right-wing viewpoints expressed in his article "On the Leadership of Dramatic Work" published in the 11th issue of "Drama News."

In his article, Wu Zuguang negated the achievements in the dramatic arts since liberation, arguing that the superiority of the socialist system was not demonstrated in artistic creation and the nurturing of new artistic talent. Taking opera work as an example, he said that "opera reform cadres" "do more harm than good." In his article, he attacked the principle of democratic centralism and what he called the "organizational system," pitting the organization against the individual, arguing that "the unprecedented expansion of organizational power has relatively reduced individual power." He said that the "organizational system" made it impossible for artists to move an inch; organizational assignments were like mismatched marriages; "the result of the unlimited expansion of leadership authority is inevitably an increasing arrogance and self-righteousness. Starting with subjectivism, dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy are bound to follow." He believed that the root of all errors and shortcomings lay in the Party's leadership, and therefore concluded that the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work must be abolished, and that "the almost superstitious worship" of the Central Committee must be "eliminated."

The Chinese Dramatists Association held two symposiums on June 23rd and July 1st. At the meetings, more than twenty playwrights, directors, and actors unanimously agreed in their speeches that the dramatic arts must require the Party to further strengthen its leadership in order to flourish and develop. They cited facts to forcefully illustrate the achievements of the Party's leadership in the dramatic arts. They also pointed out some shortcomings in their work that need to be corrected in their speeches.

Ma Shaobo pointed out that Wu Zuguang's views are no longer a matter of artistic opinion, but a matter of political inclination. He used the same tactics as the right-wingers in attacking the Party: first negating achievements, and finally negating the Party's leadership. Chen Baichen said that Wu Zuguang's arguments were matters of right and wrong and must be debated, and that their harm lay in the fact that the facts he cited were specious and could resonate with some people. He said that in fact, under the guidance of the Party's "Hundred Flowers" policy, the dramatic arts have achieved unprecedented development. A Jia said that criticizing certain shortcomings in the Party's leadership of dramatic work should be for the purpose of consolidating leadership, and should not be used as an excuse to abolish leadership.

Ma Yanxiang said that the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" for the dramatic arts is correct. Even if there have been some shortcomings in the work in recent years, they have been corrected in a timely manner. For example, in 1950, the Ministry of Culture rashly opposed the apprenticeship system in the opera world, which was a loss for the cultivation of new talent, but in 1953, this error was corrected, and it was stipulated that state-run troupes with conditions should recruit students, and that "respecting teachers and loving apprentices" should be promoted. Ma Yanxiang said that Wu Zuguang also blamed the leadership for his inability to produce works after liberation, believing that it was due to the leadership's constraints on him. In fact, in recent years, the leadership has given him many opportunities to engage in artistic creation, but because his own life is poor and he has not seriously carried out ideological transformation, he has not been able to make greater achievements.

Jiao Juyin believes that since liberation, there has been great improvement in all aspects, from script creation, acting methods, and stage art, etc., which would not have been possible without the correct leadership of the Party and the implementation of the Party's literary and artistic policies by all literary and artistic workers.

Zhou Xinfang said that the dramatic arts can only develop under the leadership of the Party, which is proven by the fact that folk professional troupes are striving to strengthen the leadership over them. Yuan Xuefen once told him that without the Party's leadership and the help of new literary and artistic workers, there would be no Yue opera. Zhou Xinfang pointed out that this is also the reason why Yue opera has developed so rapidly. He believes that the Party has also made great achievements in cultivating new talent in the dramatic arts in recent years, but it has only been seven or eight years from liberation to today, and a seedling cannot immediately become a towering tree. It also takes time for an actor to achieve something in art, and it takes the age of Yang Xiaolou to reach such a mature state.

Jin Shan listed facts to show that many contemporary artistic talents have grown up under the direct and indirect guidance and cultivation of the Party, and Wu Zuguang himself is one of them. His first play "Phoenix City" received the attention of the Party. Later, several plays he created under the Party's cultivation had progressive political tendencies, and were therefore well received by the audience. Jing Guoxue said that Wu Zuguang's wife, Xin Fengxia, also became famous throughout the country after liberation; Yao Xuanqiu, a young Chao opera actress who recently came to Beijing to perform, learned opera after liberation and now has a considerable level of artistic skill.

Xin Fengxia also issued a written opinion. She said that many parts of Wu Zuguang's article are one-sided and not based on facts. She said that although she had sung opera for seven or eight years before liberation, looking back, it was just about making a living. She believes that she is an actress cultivated by the new society. She said that opera artists must have the help of new literary and artistic workers. Recently, she also accepted an invitation from "Literary Gazette" to write an article on her experience of cooperating with new literary and artistic workers. She hopes that comrades in the opera world will not be influenced by Wu Zuguang, and should affirm the achievements made by new literary and artistic workers in participating in opera reform work. Shortcomings in cooperation can be corrected. Chen Shufang said that without the Party's leadership, she could not have improved ideologically and artistically. She was poor and destitute before liberation, and there was no question of artistic training. In the early days of liberation, she also performed bad plays due to her vague class stand. She believes that young actors grow up especially quickly under the leadership of the Party. Taking Sichuan opera as an example, after liberation, many excellent young actors have emerged. In the past, it took several years to learn some plays well, but now it only takes a few months. Because the old artists' ideological awareness has improved and their lives are stable, they have no worries, so they no longer need to "hold back," but strive to cultivate new people for the country and try to teach their art to young people. Yuan Shihai said that state-run troupes have great advantages, because under the direct leadership of the Party, actors' ideological understanding improves quickly, and the quality of their performances is also high. He said that unavoidable shortcomings still exist, of course, so rectification is necessary. But if anyone tries to take advantage of this opportunity to deliberately exaggerate shortcomings, obliterate achievements, and resonate with right-wingers, that is absolutely not allowed. Yu opera actress Chang Xiangyu used her own experience to illustrate the different encounters of an actor in the new and old societies. She said that in the old society, actors were only subjected to abuse. Without the Party's leadership, she could not have achieved today's achievements. Peking opera actress Du Jinfang and Lu opera actress Lang Xianfen also used their personal experiences to illustrate how the Party attaches importance to the cultivation of new people. Du Jinfang said that the Party liberated her from the constraints of the old apprenticeship system. Lang Xianfen was still a junior high school student six years ago, but now she is a famous Lu opera actress.

Feng Zi and Diao Guangqin pointed out in their speeches that the unprecedented size of the drama troupe since liberation is enough to illustrate the achievements of the Party's leadership.

Wu Zuguang attended the meeting and said that he accepted everyone's criticism and was willing to examine his mistakes.

The two meetings were presided over by Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association. He made a final speech at the second meeting, agreeing with the comrades present's solemn criticism of Wu Zuguang. He also said that the theater community will continue to launch a critique of right-wing ideas.

### 戏剧事业的成就不容任意抹煞  北京戏剧界人士批判吴祖光的右派观点

    戏剧事业的成就不容任意抹煞
    北京戏剧界人士批判吴祖光的右派观点
    新华社7日讯　北京戏剧界人士正在批判吴祖光在第十一期“戏剧报”上发表的“谈戏剧工作的领导问题”一文中的右派观点。
    吴祖光在文章中否定解放以来戏剧事业方面的成就，认为社会主义制度优越性在文艺创作和培养文艺界新生力量方面无所表现。他举戏曲工作为例，说“戏改干部”“成事不足，败事有余”。他在文章中攻击民主集中制的原则，攻击他所谓的“组织制度”。把组织和个人对立起来，认为“组织力量的空前庞大使个人力量相对地减少了”。他说，“组织制度”使艺术家寸步难行；组织分配是乱点鸳鸯；“领导权限无限扩展的结果，必然是日深一日的目空一切，自以为是。从主观主义开始，教条主义、宗派主义、官僚主义必然接踵而来”。他认为一切错误缺点的根源在于党的领导，因此结论是必须取消党对文艺工作的领导，并且要“消灭”“对中央的迹近迷信的崇拜”。
    中国戏剧家协会在6月23日和7月1日召开两次座谈会。会上，二十多位剧作家、导演、演员在发言中一致认为戏剧事业必须要求党进一步加强领导，才能更加繁荣发展，大家列举事实，有力地说明了党领导戏剧事业的成就。他们在发言中也指出了工作中有待改正的某些缺点。
    马少波指出，吴祖光的这些意见已不属于艺术见解问题，而是政治倾向问题。他同右派分子攻击党的手法一样：先否定成绩，最后否定党的领导。陈白尘指出吴祖光的论点是大是大非，必须争辩，其危害性在于他所举的事实似是而非，能够得到一些人的同感。他说，实际上戏剧事业在党的“百花齐放”方针的指导下，已经得到了史无前例的发展。阿甲说，批评党领导戏剧工作中的某些缺点，应该是为了巩固领导，不能借此来取消领导。
    马彦祥说，党对戏剧事业的方针“百花齐放，推陈出新”是正确的。几年来即使工作中有些缺点，也在及时纠正。例如1950年文化部轻率地反对戏曲界的师徒制，对培养新生力量是有损失的，可是到1953年就纠正这个错误，规定有条件的国营剧团吸收学员，并且提倡“尊师爱徒”。马彦祥说，吴祖光把自己在解放后写不出作品来的责任也推给领导，认为是领导对他约束所致。实际上这几年来，领导上给了他不少从事艺术创作的机会，可是由于他自己生活贫乏，没有认真进行思想改造，因而不能作出更大成绩。
    焦菊隐认为解放以来从剧本创作、表演方法和舞台美术等等各方面都有很大提高，如果不是党的正确领导，如果不是全体文艺工作者贯彻执行党的文艺方针，是不可能达到的。
    周信芳说，戏剧事业在党的领导下才有发展，只要看民间职业剧团努力争取加强对他们的领导就是证明。袁雪芬曾对他说，如果没有党的领导、没有新文艺工作者的帮助就没有越剧。周信芳指出，这也是越剧发展特别快的原因。他认为党这几年来在培养戏剧界的新生力量方面也已作出很大成绩，可是从解放到今天也不过七、八年，一株幼苗不能立刻变成参天大树。一个演员要在艺术上有所成就也不是一朝一夕之功，要达到杨小楼这样成熟的境地，也要有杨小楼的岁数。
    金山列举事实，说明当代许多艺术人才都是在党直接、间接的指导和培养下成长起来的，而吴祖光本人也是其中之一。他的第一个戏
  “凤凰城”出来后，就得到了党的重视。以后，他在党培养下创作的几个戏都有进步的政治倾向，因而受到观众好评。景孤血说，吴祖光的夫人新凤霞也是解放后才名闻全国的；最近到北京来演出的潮剧青年演员姚璇秋是在解放后才学戏的，现在已经具有相当的艺术水平。
    新凤霞也发表了书面意见。她说，吴祖光的文章很多地方都是片面的、不实事求是的。她说，我虽然在解放前唱过七、八年戏，回头看看，那时候不过是挣命，她认为她是新社会培养起来的演员。她说戏曲艺人非要新文艺工作者帮助不可，最近她还应“文艺报”的约稿，准备写一篇和新文艺工作者合作的经验。她希望戏曲界同志不要受吴祖光的影响，应该肯定新文艺工作者参加戏曲改革工作所获得的成绩，合作中有缺点是可以改正的。陈书舫说，没有党的领导，她不可能从思想上、艺术上得到提高。她在解放前穷愁潦倒，谈不上艺术进修。在解放初期还由于阶级立场模糊而演过坏戏。她认为只有在党的领导下，青年演员成长才特别快，以川剧而论，解放以后，已经出现了不少优秀的青年演员。过去有些戏要学好几年，现在几个月就行了。因为老艺人思想觉悟都提高了，生活又很安定，他们没有什么顾虑，就不必要再“留一手”，而是要努力地为国家培养新人，尽量把自己的艺术教给青年。袁世海说，国营剧团是有很大优越性的，因为在党的直接领导下，演员思想认识提高得快，演出艺术质量也高。他说，不可避免的缺点当然还是有，所以要整风。但是如果有人妄想利用这个机会，故意夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，和右派分子共鸣，那是绝对不容许的。豫剧演员常香玉以自己的经历来说明一个演员在新、旧社会里的不同遭遇。她说，在旧社会演员们只有受到摧残，如果没有党的领导，她决不可能获得今天的成就。京剧演员杜近芳和吕剧演员郎咸芬也以切身体会来说明党是怎样重视培养新人的。杜近芳说，是党把她从旧的师徒制度的约束里解放出来的。郎咸芬在六年前还是一个初中学生，而现在已经是吕剧名演员。
    凤子、刁光覃在发言中指出，解放以后话剧队伍空前庞大就足以说明党的领导的成就。
    吴祖光参加了会议，他表示接受大家的批评，愿意检查自己的错误。
    这两次会议都是中国戏剧家协会主席田汉主持的。他在第二次会上最后发言，同意与会同志对吴祖光所作的严正批评。并表示戏剧界将继续展开对右派思想的批判。
