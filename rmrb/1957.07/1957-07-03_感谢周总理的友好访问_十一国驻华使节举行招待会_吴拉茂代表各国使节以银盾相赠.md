Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: The ambassadors and economic delegation heads from eleven European and Asian countries that Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited at the end of last year and the beginning of this year jointly held a reception in Beijing this afternoon.

Premier Zhou Enlai and his wife, and Vice Premier He Long and his wife, attended the reception.

At the reception, Burmese Ambassador Wu Laomu, on behalf of the ambassadors and economic delegation heads of ten countries and himself, presented a beautiful silver shield to Premier Zhou Enlai as a memento.

Wu Laomu said that Premier Zhou Enlai concluded his friendly visits to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Burma, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Ceylon half a year ago. These visits were not only outstandingly successful, but also provided an opportunity for Your Excellency and the leaders of our respective countries to freely and frankly exchange views on matters of common interest. Your Excellency's great efforts in visiting eleven countries in seventy-five days have led to closer friendship and understanding between the Chinese government and people and the governments and people of our respective countries.

The top of the gift is inlaid with the national emblems of the eleven countries, symbolizing the friendly unity of these countries. The bottom of the gift has five doves flying with outstretched wings, symbolizing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the ten wings spread by the five doves also symbolize the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. The center of the gift is a map of the eleven countries visited by Premier Zhou Enlai on a globe, and there is also a model of an airplane on the map.

After accepting the gift, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke and thanked the ambassadors and economic delegation heads of the eleven countries. He said that the design of this precious gift is very exquisite and complete. It expresses the mission undertaken by Vice Premier He Long and me, on behalf of the Chinese government, in visiting eleven countries half a year ago, the friendly hospitality we received, and the common goals we follow and seek. The gift is inlaid with the national emblems of the eleven countries, which is a common souvenir, symbolizing our friendly unity. We must promote, consolidate, and extend this spirit of unity, not only among our twelve countries—including the nationally independent countries of Asia and the socialist countries of Europe and Asia—but also we are willing to unite with all peace-loving countries in the world. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the purpose of our visit to these eleven countries was to seek peace, seek friendship, and seek knowledge. After the visit, we found that these countries are willing to have peace, are willing to be friendly, and have abundant knowledge worth learning. Of course, this search is only the beginning. The friendship between our twelve countries should continue to develop, our desire for peace should be expanded, and we should constantly learn from each other. We must also extend this desire to seek peace, seek friendship, and seek knowledge to all countries and people in the world who are willing to be friendly with us.

Also present at the reception were the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and the staff members who accompanied Premier Zhou Enlai on his visit to the eleven countries. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception. (Picture attached)

    感谢周总理的友好访问
    十一国驻华使节举行招待会
    吴拉茂代表各国使节以银盾相赠
    新华社2日讯　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在去年年底和今年年初曾经访问过的欧亚两洲十一个国家的驻华大使和经济代表团团长，今天下午在北京联合举行了一次招待会。
    周恩来总理和夫人、贺龙副总理和夫人都出席了招待会。
    招待会上，缅甸大使吴拉茂代表十个国家的大使和经济代表团团长以及他本人把一座精美的银盾赠送给周恩来总理作纪念。
    吴拉茂说，周恩来总理阁下在半年前结束了他在越南民主共和国、柬埔寨、印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、苏联、波兰、匈牙利、阿富汗、尼泊尔和锡兰的友好访问。这些访问不只是突出地成功，而且为总理阁下和我们各国的领袖们提供机会，使他们能够就有关共同利益的事情自由地坦率地交换了意见。阁下在七十五天内访问十一个国家而做出极大努力已经导致中国政府和人民和我们各别国家的政府和人民之间的更亲密的友好和谅解。
    礼品的上端嵌有十一个国家的国徽，象征着这些国家的友好团结。礼品的底部有五只展翅飞翔的和平鸽，象征着和平共处的五项原则，五只和平鸽展开的十只翅膀，又象征着万隆会议的十项原则。礼品的中央的地球上是周恩来总理所访问的十一个国家的地图，地图上面还有一架飞机的模型。
    周恩来总理接受礼品以后讲话，向十一个国家的大使和经济代表团团长表示感谢。他说，这个珍贵礼品的设计是非常精美和完备的，它把半年前我和贺龙副总理代表中国政府访问十一个国家所负的使命、所接受的友好招待和我们所遵循和寻求的共同目标都表现出来了。礼品上嵌有十一个国家的国徽，这是一个共同的纪念品，象征着我们的友好团结。我们要把这种团结的精神发扬、巩固和推广，不仅我们十二个国家——包括亚洲的民族独立国家和欧洲、亚洲的社会主义国家要团结起来，而且我们愿意同世界上一切爱好和平的国家团结起来。周恩来总理说，我们访问这十一个国家的目的，就是寻求和平，寻求友谊和寻求知识。经过访问以后，我们发现这些国家都愿意和平，愿意友好，而且有丰富的知识值得我们学习。当然，这种寻求仅仅是开始。我们十二个国家的友谊应该发展下去，我们的和平愿望应该扩大起来，我们应该不断地互相学习。我们还要把这种寻求和平、寻求友谊、寻求知识的愿望推广到世界上一切愿意同我们友好的国家和人民中去。
    出席这个招待会的，还有外交部副部长和曾经随同周恩来总理访问十一国的随行人员。各国驻华使节也出席了招待会。（附图片）
