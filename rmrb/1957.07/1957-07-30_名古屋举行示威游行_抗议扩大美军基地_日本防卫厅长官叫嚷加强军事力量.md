    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: TASS Tokyo, July 29th: According to the "Akahata" newspaper, a demonstration was recently held in Nagoya, Japan, to protest the expansion of the US Air Force base in Komaki, Aichi Prefecture.
    Participants included representatives from the Aichi Prefecture labor unions, student organizations, members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, and personnel from other democratic groups. Demonstrators marched through the city streets carrying union red flags and signs with slogans like: "Immediately stop the work of expanding the atomic base!"
    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Defense Agency Director-General Juichi Tsushima told approximately one hundred senior Japanese military officers today that, with the withdrawal of US ground forces stationed in Japan, Japan must strengthen its military power.
    He said that the Japanese government had recently decided on a basic policy for national defense, and the National Defense Council would soon decide on a plan to enhance "defense capabilities." He considers this a "period of transition," a time when Japan "urgently needs to enrich and strengthen its self-defense system."
    The "National Defense Council" will meet tomorrow to discuss the basic steps for implementing the military expansion plan.
