Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Currently, central government organs are comprehensively launching a struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements in all sectors. According to statistics from sixty-one government units, over 175,000 people are participating in this struggle.

	The vigorous anti-Rightist struggle in various government organs has, in effect, formed a profound socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. Through this struggle, it has been exposed that some people have not entered socialism ideologically. A very small number of right-wing elements have taken advantage of the rectification movement of the Communist Party to launch attacks on the Party and the state from all aspects, including the state system, Party policies, and the work of government organs. Although the number of right-wing elements is small, they are distributed across all sectors, both inside and outside the Party.

	In order to defeat the right-wing's attacks, the broad masses of government cadres have launched a resolute struggle. Some government organs have held dozens of meetings in a row, relentlessly exposing and thoroughly criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of right-wing elements, thereby deeply educating the vast majority of government cadres. Qian Huiyu, a right-wing element and member of the Communist Youth League in the General Office of the Ministry of Urban Construction, put forward "Nine Points of Opinion" against the Party and socialism during the period of great airing of views. She slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and attacked personnel work and leading Party cadres. She claimed that the new China led by the Communist Party was a "Party-owned world," said that now it was "a new emperor with each dynasty," and believed that the saying that "Communist Party members suffer first and enjoy later" was merely "nice to say" but "an unfulfilled dogma." In order to clarify the facts, the Ministry of Urban Construction held three large-scale debates, refuting Qian Huiyu's fallacies with a large amount of facts. Qian Huiyu, at a loss for words, finally said that she was "in an unresolvable contradiction." After a resolute struggle, the mastermind behind this right-wing element—Wang Songhua, who helped her fabricate the "Nine Points of Opinion" to attack the Party—was also exposed by the masses. After three debates, some people who originally agreed with Qian Huiyu's opinions abandoned their erroneous views, and some people with blurred understanding took the initiative to conduct self-criticism and stood on the socialist position to fight against the right-wing elements.

	Some right-wing elements within the Party colluded with right-wing elements outside the Party, attacking the Party from within, causing extremely harmful consequences. The Survey Company of the Ministry of Chemical Industry exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Yan Yicai, a right-wing element within the Party. Yan Yicai recently wrote two reactionary articles, "A Two-Party System is Suitable for China's National Conditions" and "The Communist Party Regime is Not Consolidated, Our People Stand Up and Invite You to See." In his articles, he expressed his willingness to "unite and organize a united front" with Zhang Bojun, a right-wing element, and "strive to realize common ideals." Yan Yicai was a probationary member of the Communist Party, and he requested to withdraw from the Party because he said that the purpose of establishing a "new united front" was to "overthrow the Communist Party." Geng Qun, a right-wing element within the Party exposed by the Ministry of Geology, was the deputy director of the Policy Research Office of the Ministry of Geology. He cooperated with right-wing elements outside the Party in attacking the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was a "high-pressure policy" and that it was wrong to mobilize the masses to participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. He even exposed important Party secrets at a mass meeting, openly betraying the Party. Cadres of the Ministry of Geology relentlessly exposed and resolutely struggled against this right-wing element's anti-Party words and deeds.

	As the struggle is fully launched, new right-wing elements have been successively exposed in various sectors. Such as Dong Shilian, legal advisor of the Ministry of Foreign Trade; Li Taihua, associate researcher of the European and American Research Office of this ministry; Wang Gongpu, technician of the Ministry of Urban Construction; Dai Huang, reporter of Xinhua News Agency; Lan Yu, deputy editor-in-chief of Popular Reading Publishing House; Zheng Baitao, editor of China News Service, etc. In the anti-Rightist struggle, some right-wing cliques have also been exposed. Yu Gan, Liu Chenggong, Liang Ming, and Deng Shusheng of the Editorial Department of Current Events Handbook are an anti-Party and anti-socialist clique.

	In the anti-Rightist struggle, various units have adhered to the policy of reasoning. Many units first published the statements of the right-wing elements before criticizing their remarks, allowing everyone to freely discuss, and then held forums or large-scale debates to refute them. Some units also focused on using the specific facts of their own units to carry out reasoning and struggle with the right-wing elements, so that many people who were confused by the right-wing remarks quickly distinguished right from wrong, and actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle.

	The anti-Rightist struggle in central government organs is gradually deepening. Party organizations are conscientiously leading this struggle, educating Party members and cadres through the struggle. The Working Committee of the Central Government Organs of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of all members on the 22nd. The meeting required the Party organizations of various units of the central government organs to specifically and deeply guide the healthy development of this struggle during the in-depth launch of the anti-Rightist struggle, and to promote the administrative leadership to earnestly examine the leadership work in the previous period and improve the leadership style in order to ensure the smooth development of the anti-Rightist struggle. In order to ensure the victory of the struggle and to educate Party members and the masses through this struggle, the meeting criticized the simplistic approach and the tendency of sentimentalism shown by individual units in the anti-Rightist struggle.

### 反右派斗争是政治上思想上的社会主义革命运动  中央机关全面展开反右派斗争

    反右派斗争是政治上思想上的社会主义革命运动
    中央机关全面展开反右派斗争
    新华社24日讯　中央国家机关目前正在各行各业全面地展开了反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争。根据六十一个机关单位的统计，参加这个斗争的有十七万五千多人。
    各机关轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，实际上形成了一次深刻的政治上思想上的社会主义革命运动。通过这个斗争，暴露了有些人在思想上并没有进入社会主义，有极少数右派分子，他们利用了共产党整风的机会，从国家的制度、从党的政策、从机关的工作等各个方面来向党和国家发动了进攻。右派分子数量虽少，但是分布在各行各业中，党外有，党内也有。
    为了打垮右派的进攻，广大的机关干部展开了坚决的斗争，有的机关连续召开了数十次会议，对右派分子的反动言行进行了无情的揭露，彻底的批判，使广大机关干部受到了深刻的教育。城市建设部办公厅一个右派分子、青年团员钱辉焴在大鸣大放中，曾提出反党反社会主义的“九点意见”。她诬蔑肃反运动，攻击人事工作和党的领导干部。她认为共产党领导的新中国是“党天下”，说现在是“一朝天子一朝臣”，认为“共产党员吃苦在先，享乐在后”的说法，只是“说得好听”，是“没有兑现的教条”。城市建设部为了弄清是非，曾开了三次大型辩论会，以大量的事实驳斥了钱辉焴的谬论。钱辉焴理屈词穷，最后她说她“处在不能解决的矛盾中”。经过坚决的斗争，这个右派分子的幕后指挥人——即帮助她制造向党进攻的“九点意见”的王颂华，也被群众揭发出来。经过三次辩论以后，有一些原来赞同钱辉焴意见的人，放弃了自己的错误意见，有些认识模糊的人，主动作了检讨，站到了社会主义的立场，同右派分子展开了斗争。
    有些党内的右派分子，同党外的右派分子互相策应，他们从内部来攻击党，造成了极为有害的恶果。化学工业部勘察公司揭露了党内右派分子阎义采的反动言行。阎义采在最近写了“两党制适合中国国情”、“共产党政权是不巩固的，我们的人站出来请你们看”的两篇反动文章。他在文章中表示愿意和右派分子章伯钧“联合组织统一战线”、“为实现共同的理想而努力奋斗”。阎义采是中共预备党员，他提出了退党的请求，因为他说他成立“新的统一战线”目的是为了“打倒共产党”。地质部揭露的党内右派分子耿群，是地质部政策研究室副主任。他在党内配合党外右派分子攻击肃反运动，说肃反运动是“高压的政策”，认为发动群众参加肃反运动是错误的，他甚至在群众大会上暴露了党内的重要机密，公开地叛变了党。地质部干部对于这个右派分子的反党言行进行了毫不留情的揭发和坚决的斗争。
    随着斗争的全面展开，各行各业陆续揭发出一些新的右派分子。如对外贸易部的法律室顾问董士廉，这个部的欧美研究室副研究员李太华，城市建设部的技术员王公朴，新华通讯社的记者戴煌，通俗读物出版社副总编辑蓝钰，中国新闻社编辑郑白涛等。在反右派斗争中，还揭发出一些右派小集团。时事手册编辑部的于干、刘沉弓、梁明、邓蜀生就是一个反党反社会主义的小集团。
    各单位在反右派的斗争中，坚持了说理的方针。许多单位在批判右派言论以前，都先把右派分子的言论公布出来，让大家自由讨论，然后再开座谈会或大型辩论会进行驳斥。有的单位并且着重用本单位的具体事实同右派分子进行说理斗争，这样就使许多被右派言论迷惑的人很快地辨清了是非，从而积极地参加反右派斗争。
    中央国家机关反右派斗争正在逐步深入，党的组织认真地领导了这个斗争，通过斗争来教育党员和干部。中国共产党中央国家机关委员会在22日召开了全体委员扩大会议，会议要求中央国家机关各单位的党组织在反右派斗争深入展开时，要具体、深入地引导这个斗争健康地发展，并且推动行政领导方面切实检查前一时期的领导工作，改进领导作风，以保证反右派斗争的顺利开展。为了保证斗争的胜利，为了通过这次斗争来教育党员和群众，会上曾经批评了个别单位在反右派斗争中表现出的简单化的作法和温情主义的倾向。
