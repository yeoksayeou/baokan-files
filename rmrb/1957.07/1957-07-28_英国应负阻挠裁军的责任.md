Britain Should Be Held Responsible for Obstructing Disarmament

Commentator of this newspaper

Recently, in the British House of Commons debate on disarmament, British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd repeatedly defended the Western countries' position of obstructing disarmament agreements, and emphasized that Britain will continue to oppose the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

The British government's attitude is largely responsible for the failure of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee's negotiations in London to achieve the progress it should have.

The London talks, which began in March this year, were launched amidst a rising tide of public opposition to hydrogen bomb testing and demands for a disarmament agreement from countries around the world. Given the urgency of the issue of halting nuclear weapons testing, the Soviet Union had long put forward concrete proposals calling for an immediate agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

However, the British government, colluding with the United States, has consistently rejected the Soviet proposals, thus preventing the negotiations from reaching any agreement so far. At the same time, it insisted on conducting a series of hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island, regardless of widespread protests at home and abroad.

Since the start of the London disarmament talks more than four months ago, Western countries have been evasive and unwilling to seriously discuss the Soviet Union's proposals, which had been put forward long ago, for an immediate and unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the commencement of disarmament. It was not until July 2 that Lloyd, on behalf of the Western countries, put forward a counter-proposal, which linked the issue of halting nuclear testing with the issue of the first phase of an agreement on comprehensive disarmament, and required the cessation of the production of fissile materials for military purposes as a condition. This counter-proposal was, in effect, intended to block the path to any rapid disarmament agreement.

At one point, the U.S. disarmament negotiator had individual contacts with the Soviet negotiator. The British government, fearing progress in the disarmament talks, strongly advocated "joint action" by the Western countries. This attitude of the British government, like the anti-disarmament activities of the Adenauer government, which is closely colluding with the United States, provided a new excuse for the United States to obstruct disarmament and oppose an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The U.S. government immediately publicized the need for consultations among the Western "allies," using this to conceal the fact that it was doing its utmost to delay a disarmament agreement.

Recently, the British government has retreated even further. In the British House of Commons debate on disarmament, British government spokesmen not only opposed a cessation of testing, but further opposed the so-called cessation of the production of fissile materials for military purposes, which the Western countries themselves had put forward as a prerequisite for a cessation of testing. Defense Minister Sandys insisted that stopping testing and stopping the production of fissile materials was currently "very disadvantageous" to Britain, emphasizing that Britain must continue to conduct tests and increase its reserves of fissile materials. Lloyd followed Dulles even more closely in spreading the absurd argument that an agreement to ban nuclear weapons immediately was not "worth the paper it was written on." This argument was intended to fundamentally negate the significance of an agreement and create an atmosphere of complete international distrust in order to facilitate the Western countries' continued obstruction of an agreement.

Britain has adopted this closed-door attitude on the major current issue of disarmament, namely the cessation of nuclear testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, but at the same time puts on an act and deliberately disseminates an optimistic atmosphere about disarmament. On July 18, the British Foreign Office specially issued a white paper, hypocritically saying that the London talks had made "great progress" and that the hope of reaching a partial agreement had "greatly increased." One day earlier, Lloyd had made a solemn proposal at the Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, advocating the establishment of several working groups to study the technical details of several issues related to disarmament separately. It can be seen at a glance that after refusing to reach an agreement on the substance of the issue, and then advocating the establishment of groups to study technical issues, this is merely a trick to evade responsibility for delaying an agreement.

This two-faced approach of the British government echoes the approach of the U.S. government on the issue of disarmament. Without Britain's cooperation, it would be much more difficult for the United States to delay the disarmament talks on its own. But the British government, out of imperialist considerations, is unwilling to see an effective improvement in international relations, and is also unwilling to give up the idea of using nuclear weapons as a tool to blackmail the people of all countries, vainly hoping to rely on nuclear weapons to maintain the position of a colonial empire in the face of storms.

However, the British government's adoption of this policy is completely contrary to the national interests of Britain. This policy will not only continue to subject the British people to a heavy burden of armaments, with the danger of dragging the British people into a nuclear war, but will also never improve Britain's position. No matter what the British ruling clique plans, a full-scale nuclear arms race in a tense international situation will inevitably leave Britain in a position of dependence on the United States, and at the same time, it will be impossible to fundamentally improve the economic situation.

    英国应负阻挠裁军的责任
    本报评论员
    最近，在英国下院关于裁军问题的辩论中，英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德，曾一再为西方国家阻挠裁军协议的立场进行辩护，并且强调英国将继续反对禁止核武器和停止核武器试验。
    英国政府的这种态度，对于联合国裁军小组委员会这次在伦敦举行的谈判之所以未能取得应有的进展，负有很大的责任。
    今年3月以来的伦敦谈判，是在世界各国公众反对氢弹试验和要求成立裁军协议的高潮中开始的。鉴于停止核武器试验问题的迫切性，苏联早就提出了具体的建议，要求立即就停止核武器试验问题先签订一项协定。
    但是，英国政府同美国勾结一起，一直拒绝苏联的建议，因此使得谈判至今未能达成任何协议。同时，它还不顾国内外的广泛抗议，坚持在圣诞岛进行了一系列的氢弹试验。
    自从这次伦敦裁军谈判开始，在四个多月中，西方国家一直躲躲闪闪，不肯认真地讨论苏联早已提出的关于立即无条件停止核武器试验和开始裁军的建议。直到7月2日，劳埃德才代表西方国家提出一项反建议，其中把停止核试验的问题和关于全面裁军的第一阶段的协议问题连在一起，并且要求以停止生产军用的裂变物质为条件。这个反建议实际上是要堵塞迅速达成任何裁军协议的道路。
    有一个时候，美国裁军谈判代表曾同苏联谈判代表进行了个别的接触，英国政府深怕裁军谈判获得进展，就力主西方国家“共同行动”。英国政府的这种态度，和同美国紧密勾结的阿登纳政府的反裁军活动一样，为美国阻挠裁军和反对立即停止核武器试验提供了新的借口。美国政府立即大事宣传在西方“盟国”之间进行协商的必要，以此掩饰它竭力拖延裁军协议的事实。
    最近，英国政府甚至后退得更远了。在英国下议院关于裁军问题的辩论中，英国政府发言人不但反对停止试验，而且进一步反对西方国家自己提出来的作为停止试验的先决条件的所谓停止生产军用裂变物质的主张。国防大臣桑迪斯硬说目前停止试验和停止裂变物质生产对英国“十分不利”，强调英国必须继续进行试验和增加裂变物质的储备。劳埃德更紧随在杜勒斯之后，散布这样一种荒谬论调：立即签订一项禁止核武器的协定的价值“连用来书写这项协议的纸张都不及”。这种论调是想根本否定协定的意义，制造国际间完全不信任的空气，以便于西方国家继续阻挠协议。
    英国在停止核试验和禁止核武器这个有关裁军的当前主要问题上，采取了这种关门的态度，但是又装模作样，故意散布关于裁军的乐观空气。7月18日，英国外交部特地发表一份白皮书，假惺惺地说伦敦谈判已经获得“巨大进展”，达成局部协议的希望“大大增加了”。在此前一天，劳埃德在裁军小组会议上煞有介事地提出一个建议，主张成立几个工作小组，来分别研究有关裁军的几个问题的技术方面的细节。一眼就能看出，在问题的实质方面拒绝达成协议之后，而又主张设立小组来研究什么技术性问题，这只不过是规避拖延协议的责任的一种花招。
    英国政府的这一套两面作法，同美国政府在裁军问题上的作法是互相呼应的。如果没有英国的配合，美国要单独拖延裁军谈判就要困难得多。但是英国政府出于帝国主义的考虑，不愿意看到国际关系得到有效的改善，也不愿意放弃以核武器作为对各国人民进行讹诈的工具的主意，妄想依靠核武器来维持处在风雨飘摇中的殖民帝国的地位。
    可是，英国政府采取这种政策，是完全不符合英国的民族利益的。这种政策不仅将继续使英国人民承受沉重的军备负担，有把英国人民拖到一场核子战争中去的危险，而且也决不可能改善英国的地位，不论英国统治集团作何打算，要在紧张的国际局势中进行全面的核军备竞赛，结果必然会使英国继续处于依附美国的地位，同时也不可能在经济状况方面得到根本的改善。
