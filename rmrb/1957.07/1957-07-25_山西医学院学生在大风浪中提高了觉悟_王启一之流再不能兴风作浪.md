    (Reported by our newspaper) Students of grades 3, classes 9 and 10, in the Department of Hygiene at Shanxi Medical College have greatly improved their political awareness through the anti-Rightist struggle, seen through the conspiracy of the Rightists, and unanimously proposed to resolutely obey the needs of the state. Thus, the "troublemaking" issue, which had lasted for nearly half a year, has been resolved.

    The sixty-six students of grades 3, classes 9 and 10, in the Department of Hygiene were all transferred from Jiangsu Medical College during the adjustment of departments in higher education institutions. In February of this year, when the school was carrying out socialist ideological education, some of the students in these two classes expressed their unease with the hygiene major and dissatisfaction with the adjustment of departments, wanting to return to Jiangsu. The Rightist Wang Qiyi (a student in class 10), who came from a bourgeois bureaucratic family and had always harbored hatred towards the new society, used the dissatisfaction among the students to organize a small group and incite trouble. He first openly proposed that "the issue now is not about talking, but about doing," and then incited "refusing to talk to school leaders," sending representatives directly to the Ministry of Higher Education to petition, saying that the department adjustment was unreasonable, that Shanxi did not have the conditions to run a hygiene department, and demanding to "return to Jiangsu." The Ministry of Higher Education met with their representatives, patiently and in detail explaining the situation to them, and asked the students to obey the requirements of the state. However, the Rightists not only did not correctly convey the opinions of the Ministry of Higher Education to the students, but instead intensified their activities, organizing more than a hundred meetings in a row, issuing many big-character posters, and further inciting the students: not to listen in class, to arbitrarily make trouble; not to study on their own after class. At the same time, they sent telegrams to the Ministry of Higher Education, organized a second petition, openly proposing to replace all the leading cadres sent to the school by the Ministry of Higher Education and to destroy the school's Communist Youth League organization. Wang Qiyi also openly declared: If the central government does not answer our demands, we will refuse to participate in the exam and immediately pack our bags and return to Jiangsu. He thus won over some students, creating a chaotic atmosphere in the two classes, with no good study for half a year, some not even reading a single page of a book.

    After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, Wang Qiyi also attempted to resist stubbornly. He did not allow the students in his class to attend the meetings and reports organized by the school, and if they attended, he would not allow them to speak. However, the fox's tail could not be hidden after all. Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League members, the students actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle. The students who had blindly followed Wang Qiyi in making trouble all drew a line with Wang Qiyi and denounced Wang Qiyi's reactionary words and deeds. Zhou Mingfeng, Liu Huisheng, Zhang Shanfa, and other students who had been key members in making trouble for Wang Qiyi all used lengthy speeches to expose and criticize Wang Qiyi's consistent reactionary remarks and conspiratorial activities, even exposing all of Wang Qiyi's conspiracy of "how to resist the anti-Rightist struggle" which he had planned the day before, at the general meeting the next day.

### 山西医学院学生在大风浪中提高了觉悟  王启一之流再不能兴风作浪

    山西医学院学生在大风浪中提高了觉悟
    王启一之流再不能兴风作浪
    本报讯　山西医学院卫生系三年级九、十班学生，经过反右派斗争，政治觉悟大大提高，识破了右派分子的阴谋，一致提出坚决服从国家需要。至此，延续近半年的“闹事”问题，得到了解决。
    卫生系三年级九班、十班六十六名学生都是在高等学校调整院系时从江苏医学院迁来的。今年2月学校在进行社会主义思想宣传教育中，该两班学生中有部分人表示不安心卫生专业；不满院系调整，想要返回江苏。出身于资产阶级官僚家庭、一贯对新社会抱有仇视态度的右派分子王启一（十班的学生），利用同学中的不满情绪，组织小集团，煽动闹事。他首先公开提出“现在不是讲的问题，而是做的问题”，接着煽动“拒绝同学校领导谈问题”，派代表直接到高教部请愿，说院系调整不合理，山西没有条件办卫生系，要求“回江苏”。高教部接见了他们的代表，耐心地详细地向他们解释，要求同学们服从国家的要求。但右派分子不但没有正确的向学生传达高教部的意见，反而变本加厉地活动起来，连续组织了一百多次会议，出了许多大字报，并且进一步煽动学生：上课不听，任意捣乱；下课不自习。同时，给高教部打电报，组织二次请愿，公开提出要把从高教部派到学校的领导干部一齐撤换，把学校的团组织搞垮。王启一还公开声言：中央如果不答复我们的要求，我们就要拒绝参加考试，马上卷铺盖回江苏。他这样拉拢了部分学生，把两个班闹的乌烟瘴气，半年没有很好的学习，有的甚至连一页书都没有看。
    反右派斗争开始后，王启一还企图顽抗。学校组织会议、作报告，他不让他们班里的同学参加，参加了不让发言。但是，狐狸尾巴终久是夹不住的，在共青团员的带动下，同学们都积极的参加了反右派斗争。原来盲目跟从王启一闹事的学生都与王启一划清了界限，纷纷痛斥王启一的反动言行。曾经为王启一当过闹事的骨干分子的周明丰、刘惠生、张善发等同学都用长篇发言，揭发与批判了王启一一贯的反动言论和阴谋活动，甚至将王启一前一天布置“如何抵制反右派斗争”的全部阴谋，第二天就在大会上揭发出来。
