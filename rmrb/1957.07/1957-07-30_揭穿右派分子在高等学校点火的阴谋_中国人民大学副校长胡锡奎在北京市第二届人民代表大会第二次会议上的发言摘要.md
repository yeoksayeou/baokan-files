The higher education sector was once one of the battlefields where the rightists fought fiercely against us. As soon as the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement began, those bourgeois rightists who妄想趁火打劫(attempted to loot a burning house) saw attacking universities as the first step in universally igniting fires and creating chaos in the world. There was a reason why the rightists chose universities across the country as their "arenas": First, a considerable number of professors and associate professors had long wavered between capitalism and socialism. And most senior intellectuals had not yet abandoned their bourgeois worldview and established a proletarian communist worldview. The rightists believed that here, they would have a group of assistants and allies to win over. Second, at present, students from exploiting class and petty-bourgeois families account for about 80% of university students, most of whom still have varying degrees of bourgeois ideology; a very small number are children of counter-revolutionaries who were killed or imprisoned, and some of them have not yet broken with their reactionary families. The rightists were very interested in these college students who had ideological problems and lacked practical struggle experience, believing that they could find a large number of "vanguards" and reserves here, and find fertile soil for their own propagation. Third, the arrogant and conceited rightists have always believed that Communists are "country bumpkins" and "outsiders" in cultural and educational undertakings, and in addition, Communist Party members do occupy a very small proportion of the professor ranks in universities. Therefore, in the eyes of the rightists, this is the "weakest" link of the Communist Party. Therefore, the rightists chose the universities as the first battlefield for launching an attack against the socialist army led by the Chinese Communist Party.

    Striving for Leadership in Universities, Negating the Party Committee System

In order to realize their strategic plan, the rightists set about striving for universities. When they took the first step in this regard, they immediately encountered the line of defense of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in universities, which made these conspirators unable to move an inch. The rightists felt that they had to remove this thorn in their side, so, in addition to universally igniting fires and viciously attacking the Party's leadership and policies, they concentrated their fire on attacking the Party committee system in universities. As early as May 13th of this year, rightists such as Huang Yaomian, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and Tao Dayong, key members of the Zhang-Luo alliance, formed a so-called "Party Committee Responsibility System" group. After research and arrangements on June 4th, they formulated a complete program for abolishing the Party committee system, euphemistically called "Our Suggestions on the Leadership System of Universities (Initial Draft)," and launched a comprehensive, public, and large-scale attack on the Party committee system.

In the first part of this thoroughly reactionary program disguised as "suggestions," the rightists viciously attacked the Party and Party members, portraying Party members working in universities as "ignorant of policies," "ignorant and incompetent," and "domineering." Describing the Party committee system as something that produces "Party taking the place of the government" and "the Party not being separated from the government," the rightists fabricated these unfounded charges precisely to provide arguments for driving Communist Party members out of universities and eliminating the Party committee system. The second part of the program interfered fiercely with the Party's internal affairs, arbitrarily stipulating rules and regulations restricting the scope of the Party's activities in universities, and even restricting the freedom of the Communist Party to hold meetings and speak; some of these restrictions were similar to the Kuomintang reactionaries' "Measures for Preventing Activities of Heterodox Parties." In the third, fourth, and fifth parts of the program, the rightists racked their brains to create various committees, the purpose of which was to disintegrate the Communist Party's leadership and eliminate it completely through their activities. The most vicious of these was the rightists' attempt to establish a school affairs committee dominated by professors and associate professors as the highest leading organ of universities. On the surface, they wanted to expand democracy, but in fact, their school affairs committee did not want the president to participate. They stipulated that "when the Party's president or vice president holds different opinions on the decisions of the school affairs committee, he can have the right to veto, but if this resolution is passed a second time, the resolution must still be implemented." This is the bourgeois "democratic system" of the bourgeois rightists negating the Party committee system and replacing it with a school affairs committee, and a blatant conspiracy to implement the seizure of leadership. This conspiracy plan was to ensure that the rightists could run rampant and do whatever they wanted in universities, turning universities into bases for capitalist restoration.

    The Rightists Want to Abolish the Ideological Leadership of Marxism-Leninism, Advocate Electives, and Abolish Political Classes

However, the Chinese Communist Party's leading position in universities cannot be shaken by a so-called "Our Suggestions on the Leadership System of Universities (Initial Draft)." The socialist consciousness of the vast majority of teachers, students, and staff is an unshakable foundation for ensuring the implementation of the Party's leadership. Faced with this ironclad fact, the cunning rightists decided to attack the ideological front of Marxism-Leninism at the same time as they put forward their "suggestions" to abolish the Party committee system.

Of course, the rightists' attack on Marxism-Leninism, this revolutionary theory, was not just to defeat the Party committee system. Marxism-Leninism is the worldview of the proletariat, the guiding ideology of socialist society, and the theoretical basis of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China. The result of this only scientific and revolutionary theory being constantly grasped by the workers and peasants is that it greatly strengthens the socialist cause led by the Party, so as to further eliminate all possibilities of the rightists restoring capitalism. Moreover, this only scientific and revolutionary theory also constantly promotes all progressive and patriotic intellectuals to advance together, transforming the ideology of the vast number of intellectuals, thus greatly reducing the territory for the growth and activities of the rightists. For this reason, the rightists hate Marxism-Leninism to the bone. They cursed Marxism-Leninism as "dogma" that must be "eliminated," slandered it as having stopped developing since Engels' death, remaining stuck in 1895, and becoming a rigid and outdated thing with only a few rules. They said that it was produced in Western Europe more than a hundred years ago and was not suitable for our national conditions. In a word, these ambitious people wanted to take this opportunity to abolish the status of Marxism-Leninism as a guiding ideology.

They opposed Marxism-Leninism under the banner of anti-dogmatism, saying that class struggle and class analysis were outdated, and that talking about these was dogmatism. They said that Marxism-Leninism hindered independent thinking and that ideological remoulding made thinking rigid. They also said that they should broaden their horizons and absorb some nutrients from bourgeois scholars. They also used a sentence from Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," euphemistically called "vaccination," but in fact spreading poison to the people. Under the premise of distorting the state's constitution and the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," they advocated that political classes be changed to electives or simply abolished, on the grounds that this was the only way to comply with the principle of "contention" and the article in the constitution that people have freedom of belief, saying that setting up political classes was using administrative methods to forcibly instill Marxism-Leninism. To put it bluntly, their purpose in abolishing political classes was to capture all university students with capitalist ideology and cultivate "talents" for the rightists. They extremely hated the propagandists of Marxism-Leninism, especially the Party and Youth League members among them. These political teachers, who were cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party, are the new blood of the intelligentsia. The vast majority of them, after being tested in this struggle, have become one of the formidable enemies that the rightists have encountered in universities, an invincible new force. The rightists were very afraid of them, so they scolded them as "old dogmatists," "little dogmatists," and "descendants of dogmatism." Finally, they concentrated some of their fire and attacked Renmin University of China, saying that it was a "dogmatic bastion" and a "dogmatic beehive" that must be "destroyed." In the eyes of the rightists, they would not be reconciled to their deaths if they did not eliminate this university.

    The Rightists Want to Restore Bourgeois Sociology and Seize the Ideological Front

While cursing Marxism-Leninism, the rightists praised bourgeois sociology, law, political science, and economics to the skies, and began to prepare to open sociology departments in universities and establish a sociology association monopolized by them throughout the country. There are two things that are most noteworthy here: The first thing is that under the control of Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, key figures of the Zhang-Luo alliance, a reactionary program called "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System" had already been put forward in the name of the Science Planning Group of the China Democratic League. In this "Opinion," they shouted that it was necessary to "change the attitude towards bourgeois sociology" and advocated "restoring" bourgeois sociology. At the same time, in the "Opinion," they also tried their best to attack the Party and the government's guidelines for guiding scientific research, praised the "benefits" of decentralized and spontaneous activities, and opposed conducting scientific research in a guided and planned manner, the purpose of which was to facilitate the smuggling of bourgeois goods by right-wing elements. The second thing is that in coordination with this extremely reactionary "Opinion," the so-called "Preparatory Committee for Sociology Work" held its first meeting on June 9th. This meeting was attended by Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Li Jinghan, Wu Wenzao, and Chen Da. At the meeting, it was privately decided to start establishing sociology departments in universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and other places where old sociologists were relatively concentrated. At the meeting, Wu Wenzao promoted that the sociology department should be "restored" at Peking University first, while Wu Jingchao argued that the sociology department must be established at Renmin University of China first, because Wu Jingchao, Li Jinghan, and Zhao Chengxin had already conspired to control the survey and research office of Renmin University of China and degenerate it to become one of the strongholds for the restoration of old sociology. Fei Xiaotong was also preparing to recruit troops and buy horses to set up another stronghold at the Central Institute for Nationalities. At this meeting, it was also internally determined that as long as the sociology department of Peking University was "reborn," Wu Wenzao would be appointed as the head of the department, and Wu Jingchao would be responsible for teaching the basic course of sociology. At the same time, the meeting also decided to formally prepare for the establishment of the "Chinese Sociological Society," with the general association located in Beijing and branches established throughout the country. The first task of this sociological society was to register teachers and sociology department graduates who had taught sociology in the past. From these activities, we can see that the purpose of the right-wing elements is precisely to oppose Marxism-Leninism, expand the influence of capitalist ideology, seize the ideological front, and clear the way for the right-wing elements to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party's leading position in cultural and educational circles.

In addition to the above three movements, the first key step taken by bourgeois rightists to seize universities also includes the Six Professors Meeting on June 6th, which analyzed the situation and tasks. The rightists also sent out their generals Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Huang Yaomian, Tao Dayong, Qian Duansheng, Li Boqiu... and others to ignite fires everywhere, and used Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily as mouthpieces to blow horns and beat drums to cooperate. Tan Tiwu, who rose to fame by opposing communism and the Soviet Union, colluded with Huang Shaohong, who was known for his merciless killings, and even directly colluded with university students everywhere to ignite fires.

Now, the rightists in universities have fallen into isolation. Some right-wing elements have indeed expressed their willingness to repent, but have not yet excavated the roots from the depths of their minds. There are also some right-wing elements who are stubbornly resisting, trying to muddle through. There are also some right-wing elements who are testing the waters, pretending to be progressive or middle-of-the-roaders, deceiving themselves and others. For the first type of people, we hope to conduct further in-depth review. For the second and third types of people, we hope that they will repent and make a prompt and thorough confession. Time cannot wait for long. If they still cling to their errors, they will be cutting themselves off from the people and will be beyond redemption.

    揭穿右派分子在高等学校点火的阴谋
    中国人民大学副校长胡锡奎在北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言摘要
    高等教育界曾经是右派和我们搏斗得十分激烈的战场之一。中国共产党的整风运动一开始，那些妄想趁火打劫的资产阶级右派分子，就把向高等学校进攻看作是普遍点火、造成天下大乱的第一步。右派之所以选择全国各大学作为自己的“擂台”是有原因的：第一、教授、副教授中有相当一部分人，长期还动摇于资本主义与社会主义之间。而多数高级知识分子还没有抛弃资产阶级的世界观和树立无产阶级的共产主义世界观。右派认为在这里，他们会有一批助手和可以争取的同盟军。第二、目前大学生中，出身于剥削阶级与小资产阶级家庭的，约占80％左右，其中大多数还存在着不同程度的资产阶级思想；其中极少数还是被杀被关的反革命分子的子女，他们有一部分人尚未和反动家庭划清界限。这些有着思想毛病而又缺乏实际斗争锻炼的大学生，右派对他们是很感兴趣的，他们满以为在这里可以找到大批的“急先锋”与后备军，可以找到自己繁殖的肥沃土壤。第三、狂妄自大的右派分子一贯认为共产党人是“土包子”，在文化教育事业上是“门外汉”，再加上共产党员在大学的教授队伍中，的确只占一个极小的比重。因此，在右派看来，这里是共产党“最薄弱”的环节。因此，右派就选择了高等学校这块地盘，作为他们向中国共产党领导的社会主义大军首先发难的战场。
    争夺高等学校的领导权，否定党委制
    为了实现自己的战略计划，右派着手争夺高等学校。当他们在这方面跨出第一步时，立刻就碰到了中国共产党在高等学校的领导权这道防线，因而弄得这些阴谋家寸步难行。右派觉得非拔掉这枚眼中钉不可，因此，除了普遍点火，对党的领导和党的政策进行恶毒的攻击外，便集中火力向高等学校党委制展开攻击。早在今年5月13日，章罗联盟的骨干黄药眠、费孝通、吴景超、陶大镛等右派分子，就成立了一个所谓“党委负责制”的小组。经过6月4日的研究、布置，制定了一套完整的取消党委制的纲领，美其名曰“我们对于高等学校领导体制的建议（草案初稿）”，向党委制实行了全面的、公开的、大张旗鼓的进攻。
    在这个以“建议”作为幌子的彻头彻尾的反动纲领的第一部分里，右派对党、对党员进行了恶毒的攻击，把在高等学校里工作的党员刻划为“不懂政策”、“不学无术”而又“独断独行”的“独夫”。把党委制描写为产生“以党代政”、“党政不分”的东西，右派分子捏造了这些莫须有的罪状，正是为了给从各大学里赶走共产党员、消灭党委制的这个阴谋提供论据。纲领的第二部分，穷凶极恶地干涉了党的内政，擅自规定限制党在各大学的活动范围的清规戒律，甚至限制共产党开会与说话的自由；这种限制有些类似国民党反动派的“防止异党活动办法”。纲领的第三、第四、第五部分中，右派更是挖空心思地制造了种种委员会，其目的是通过他们的活动，使共产党的领导权化整为零，全部消灭。其中最狠毒的是右派企图设立以教授、副教授占绝对优势的校务委员会，作为高等学校的最高领导机关，表面上是要扩大民主，而实际上他们的校务委员会是不要校长参加的，他们规定“党的校长或副校长对于校务委员会的决定持不同意见时，他可以有否决权，但如果这个决议第二次被通过时，则决议仍必须执行”。这就是资产阶级右派否定党委制代之以校务委员会的资产阶级的“民主制度”，实行篡夺领导权的明目张胆的阴谋计划。这个阴谋计划是要保证右派可以在高等学校中横行霸道，为所欲为，把高等学校变成资本主义复辟的根据地。
    右派想取消马列主义的思想领导，主张选修、取消政治课
    但是，中国共产党在高等学校的领导地位不是一个所谓“我们对于高等学校领导体制的建议（草案初稿）”所碰得动的。广大师生员工的社会主义觉悟，是保证党的领导权贯彻的不可动摇的基础。面对着这铁一般的事实，老奸巨滑的右派分子就决定在提出他们取消党委制“建议”的同时，袭击马克思列宁主义的思想阵地。
    当然，右派猛攻马克思列宁主义这个革命学说，还不只是为了打垮党委制而已。马克思列宁主义是无产阶级的世界观，是社会主义社会的指导思想，是中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的政策的理论基础。这个唯一科学与革命的学说不断的掌握了工农群众的结果，是大大的加强党所领导的社会主义事业，以便进一步消灭右派复辟资本主义的一切可能。而且这个唯一科学和革命的学说，也不断地推动了一切进步的、爱国的知识分子一同前进，使广大知识分子的思想得到改造，因而大大地缩小了右派滋长与活动的地盘。由于这个原因，右派对马克思列宁主义痛恨入骨。他们咒骂马克思列宁主义为必须“消灭”的“教条”，诬蔑它是自从恩格斯逝世后就停止了发展，还停留在1895年的地方，成为只有几个条条的僵死的过时的东西。说它是一百多年前产生于西欧的，不适合于我国国情。一句话，这些野心家想借此取消马克思列宁主义作为指导思想的地位。
    他们打着反教条主义的旗子来反对马克思列宁主义，说阶级斗争和阶级分析都过时了，再谈这些就是教条主义，说马克思列宁主义妨碍独立思考，思想改造使思想僵化，他们还说什么应该放宽眼界，向资产阶级学者吸取一些滋养料，还利用毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中的一句话，美其名曰“种牛痘”，其实是向人民散布毒素。他们在曲解国家的宪法与“百家争鸣”的精神的前提下，主张政治课改为选修或干脆取消，借口是只有这样才符合“争鸣”的原则，符合宪法中的人民有信仰自由的条文，说设立政治课，就是用行政的方法，强迫灌输马克思列宁主义。说穿了，他们取消政治课的目的，是为了用资本主义思想来俘虏全部大学生，为右派造就“人才”。他们极端痛恨马克思列宁主义的宣传员，尤其是他们之中的党团员，这是由中国共产党一手培养起来的政治教员，是知识界的新血液，绝大多数经过这次斗争的考验，已经成为右派在高等学校中所碰到的劲敌之一，是一种不可战胜的新生力量。右派很害怕他们，因而就骂他们是“老教条”、“小教条”、“教条主义的子孙”。最后，他们集中了一部分火力，攻击了中国人民大学，说它是必须“摧毁”的“教条主义堡垒”、“教条主义大蜂窝”。在右派心目中，不消灭这个大学，是死不甘心的。
    右派要恢复资产阶级社会学夺取思想阵地
    在破口咒骂马列主义的同时，右派把资产阶级社会学、法律学、政治学、经济学都捧上了天，并着手准备在各大学中开设社会学系，在全国建立他们一手包办的社会学学会。这里最值得注意的有两件事：第一件事，在章罗联盟的骨干人物曾昭抡、钱伟长掌握下，早已以中国民主同盟科学规划小组名义，提出一个所谓“对有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”的反动纲领。在这个“意见书”里，叫喊必须“改变对待资产阶级社会学的态度”，并主张“恢复”资产阶级社会学。同时，在“意见书”中，又竭力攻击党和政府的指导科学研究的方针，颂扬分散和自发的进行的“好处”，反对有领导、有计划地进行科学研究，目的是为了便于右派分子偷运资产阶级的货色。第二件事，配合着这极端反动的“意见书”在6月9日开了所谓“社会学工作筹备委员会第一次会议”，这个会议有费孝通、吴景超、李景汉、吴文藻、陈达等人参加，会上私自决定在北京、上海、广州、成都等旧社会学者比较集中的大学里，着手建立社会学系。会上吴文藻鼓吹应该首先在北京大学“恢复”社会学系，而吴景超又力争社会学系必须先建立在中国人民大学，原因是吴景超、李景汉、赵承信早已阴谋控制中国人民大学的调查研究室，使它变质，以成为复辟旧社会学的据点之一。费孝通也准备招兵买马，在中央民族学院安下另一个据点。在这个会上，又内定只要北大的社会学系“再生”，就任命吴文藻担任系主任，由吴景超担任社会学基础课的讲授。同时，会上又决定正式筹备成立“中国社会学会”，总会设在北京，全国各地设立分会。这个社会学会的第一个工作就是登记过去教社会学的教师和社会学系毕业生。从这些活动中，我们可以看出，右派分子的目的，正是为了反对马列主义，扩大资本主义思想影响，夺取思想阵地；为右派消灭中国共产党在文教界的领导地位扫清道路。
    资产阶级右派分子夺取高等学校这一首要步骤，除了以上三部曲外，还有分析形势与任务的六月六日六教授会议。右派还派出他们的大将曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通、吴景超、黄药眠、陶大镛、钱端升、李伯球……等人到处点火，并且以文汇报、光明日报为喉舌来吹号擂鼓，加以配合。以反共反苏起家驰名的谭惕吾勾结以杀人不眨眼著称的黄绍竑，更直接串通高等学校的学生到处点火。
    现在，在高等学校中的右派已陷于孤立。有一部分右派分子确实已经表示愿意改悔，但还没有从思想深处挖掘根源。还有一部分右派分子负隅顽抗，企图蒙混过关。也还有一部分右派分子试探风色，伪装进步或中间分子，自欺欺人。我们对于第一种人，希望能进一步地深入地进行检讨。对于第二种和第三种人，希望他们憣然悔悟，迅速、彻底交代。时间不能久等，如果仍然执迷不悟，那就是自绝于人民，无可挽救了。
