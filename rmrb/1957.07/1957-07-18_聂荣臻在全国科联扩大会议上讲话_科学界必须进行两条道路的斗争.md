Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: The Second Enlarged Meeting of the First National Committee of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies opened today.

    In the morning, Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the CAST, read the opening speech of Chairman Li Siguang. The opening speech stated: The primary task of this meeting, during the high tide of the nationwide anti-rightist struggle, is to actively launch a struggle against rightist elements, particularly to sternly refute and expose the absurd remarks and sinister conspiracies of rightist elements in the scientific community.

    Regarding the future work of the CAST, Li Siguang pointed out in his opening speech: To implement the central government's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," clarify the academic direction of each specialized society and the CAST, and adapt to the future development of scientific undertakings and the needs of national construction, each specialized society must gradually and realistically, in terms of organization and activities, make itself worthy of being a specialized academic organization dominated by scientists, improve academic quality, and strive to catch up with international scientific levels quickly and comprehensively.

    Scientific Undertakings Have Not Been "Interrupted" but Have Developed; Only Those with Ulterior Motives Would Deliberately Obliterate Achievements

    Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen spoke at the meeting. He said that in the eight years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, Chinese scientists have worked diligently and made many contributions in areas such as industrial and agricultural production, health care, cultivation of construction talent, and scientific research. He pointed out that after the Party Central Committee convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals and issued the call to "March towards science," scientific undertakings developed more rapidly. Now, we can see that in the past eight years, the scientific ranks have greatly expanded; existing scientific research institutions have been strengthened, and a large number of new scientific research institutions have been established; working conditions have significantly improved; large-scale equipment has been constructed or is under construction; and urgently needed and important blank sectors have begun to be established. It should be particularly pointed out that our country already has a long-term scientific vision plan. This plan points out the direction of China's scientific development and demonstrates the brilliant prospects of scientific undertakings, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of our scientists. This is a fact unanimously recognized by all honest scientists in our country. Only those with ulterior motives would deliberately obliterate all achievements, saying that since liberation, China's scientific undertakings have not developed but have been interrupted, etc. Of course, compared to the needs of national socialist construction, the development of China's scientific undertakings is still far from sufficient. However, it should be said that these past few years have laid a preliminary foundation for the great development of scientific undertakings in the future.

    The Socialist Road and the Capitalist Road Also Exist in the Development of Scientific Undertakings

    Nie Rongzhen pointed out that why has China's scientific work been able to achieve so much in such a short period of eight years? This is due to the superiority of the socialist system. The issue of the capitalist and socialist roads also exists in the development of scientific undertakings. To take the socialist road in the development of scientific undertakings means that scientific undertakings must have a clear goal of serving socialist construction, and scientists must combine national construction needs with personal expertise and combine theory with practice when choosing research topics. To take the capitalist road means denying that scientific undertakings should serve national socialist construction, advocating science for science's sake, and advocating that scientists can conduct research work based solely on personal interests, regardless of national needs. To take the socialist road in the development of scientific undertakings means having a plan, an organization, and leadership. This means that a vision plan and annual plan for the development of scientific undertakings should be formulated, there should be a focus while also taking care of all aspects, and manpower should be concentrated where it is needed and consciously dispersed where it should be dispersed, division of labor and collaboration should be strengthened, and there should be unified leadership. Taking the capitalist road means opposing the planning of scientific work and believing that it is impossible to plan scientific work at all, advocating unconditional decentralization, and believing that unified leadership is not needed. To take the socialist road in the development of scientific undertakings means that the Party must lead scientific work, while taking the capitalist road means opposing the Party's leadership of scientific work and believing that the Party cannot lead scientific work. The former road is the road we are currently taking, and most scientists in our country also agree to take this road. The achievements China has made in scientific undertakings in recent years prove the correctness of this road. We must continue to take this road in the future. The anti-socialist scientific program of the China Democratic League can represent those who advocate taking the latter road. It is not surprising that some scientists in our country do not understand the necessity of taking the socialist road or are not accustomed to taking this road, because they have received bourgeois education and have worked and lived under the capitalist system for a long time. These people will gradually change this view through ideological education and work practice. In fact, some of these scientists have already changed or are changing their views. However, bourgeois rightist elements use these scientists' weaknesses, intentionally develop and promote these erroneous views, and guide scientists onto the wrong path, thereby undermining our scientific undertakings.

    Rightist Elements Are Hostile to the Socialist Road; Scientists Must Stand Firm on the Socialist Stance

    Nie Rongzhen pointed out that the reactionary program of the rightist elements is presented in the form of providing opinions on issues related to the scientific system. But this is not the case at all. Dean Guo Moruo has already exposed this point. However, after some rightist elements were exposed, when they made self-criticisms, it seemed that the people were criticizing them simply because they should not have offered this or that opinion on their work. This statement must be refuted. We have always welcomed any well-intentioned opinions and criticisms. The reason why the remarks of rightist elements must be opposed is not because they provided opinions, but because these remarks of the rightist elements contain deep hostility towards socialism, because they attempt to oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and usurp the leadership of the country.

    Nie Rongzhen pointed out that this meeting is being held during the in-depth development of the anti-rightist campaign. In recent months, rightist elements have systematically spread many reactionary remarks in the scientific community, inciting scientists and young people against the government, and inciting scientists against each other. They stir up trouble, fearing that the scientific community will not be in chaos. This is an important aspect of their anti-socialist activities. Giving a powerful counterattack to this attack by rightist elements in the scientific field is to defend our socialist scientific undertakings. The scientific community is currently thoroughly exposing and criticizing rightist elements such as Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, which is absolutely necessary.

    Nie Rongzhen said: In this struggle against the bourgeois rightists, the necessity of ideological self-remolding for intellectuals is even more evident. If a scientist cannot clearly stand on the socialist stance, he may be used by the enemies of the people. In this way, even if he has rich knowledge, he will not only be unable to contribute to the people, but will even cause losses to the country. He said that it should be admitted that the bourgeois ideology of many scientists in our country is still quite strong. In their minds, the question of standing on the bourgeois stance or standing on the proletarian stance has not been resolved, and the dialectical materialist worldview has not been established. This situation not only prevents scientists from better serving socialist construction, but also has a negative impact on young people. Educators must be educated, and scientists should strive to transform themselves and become true people's scientists. This requires long-term and arduous efforts. At present, the most effective way of ideological remolding is to actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle. The anti-rightist struggle is a vivid and rich Marxist ideological education movement. It is hoped that scientists can actively participate in this movement and temper themselves in the struggle.

    Nie Rongzhen finally stated that the main task of the various societies is to unite researchers in their respective disciplines to promote scientific research through various academic seminars, symposiums, publications, etc. He hoped that the role of the societies would be further developed in the future, implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and making academic activities more active. The State Council's Science Planning Commission will do its best to support the work of the various specialized societies and the CAST.

    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also spoke at the meeting in the morning.

    聂荣臻在全国科联扩大会议上讲话
    科学界必须进行两条道路的斗争
    据新华社17日讯  中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会第一届全国委员会第二次扩大会议今天开幕。
    上午，科联副主席侯德榜宣读了主席李四光的开幕词。开幕词说：这次会议的首要任务是在全国人民进行激烈的反右派斗争高潮中，我们应当积极地展开反右派分子的斗争，特别是要严正的批驳和揭露科学界中右派分子的荒谬言论和罪恶阴谋。
    对科联今后工作，李四光在开幕词中指出：贯彻中央提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，明确各专门学会和科联学术方向，适应今后科学事业的发展和国家建设的需要，各专门学会必须逐步地实事求是地从组织与活动上使自己名副其实地成为以科学家为主体的专门性学术团体，提高学术质量，以期迅速地全面地赶上国际科学水平。
    科学事业不是“中断”而是发展了  别有用心的人才会故意抹煞成绩
    聂荣臻副总理在会上讲了话。他说，解放八年来，我国科学家在党和政府的领导下辛勤努力，在工农业生产、卫生保健、培养建设人才和科学研究工作等方面，作了很多工作，取得了很大的成绩。他指出，党中央召开关于知识分子问题的会议和提出“向科学进军”的号召后，科学事业有了更迅速的发展。现在，我们可以看到，八年来科学队伍大大地扩大了；原有的科学研究机构充实了，大批新的科学研究机构设置了；工作条件有了显著的改善；规模巨大的设备有的已经建设起来，有的正在建设；急需并且重要的空白部门也开始建立。特别应该指出的是我们国家已经有了长期的科学远景规划，这个规划指出了我国科学发展的方向，显示了科学事业的光辉远景，这大大鼓舞了我们科学家的热情。这是我国所有正直科学家都一致公认的事实。只有别有用心的人才故意抹煞一切成绩，说解放以来，我国科学事业不是发展了，而是中断了等等。当然，对于国家社会主义建设需要来说，我国科学事业的发展还是很不够的。但是应该说这几年已经为今后科学事业的大发展奠定了初步基础。
    在发展科学事业中同样存在着社会主义道路和资本主义道路
    聂荣臻指出，为什么在短短的八年中，我国科学工作能够取得较多的成绩呢？这是由于社会主义制度的优越性。在发展科学事业中同样存在着资本主义和社会主义两条道路的问题。在发展科学事业中走社会主义道路，就是科学事业要有为社会主义建设服务的明确目标，科学家在选择研究题目时要根据国家建设需要和个人专长相结合、理论和实际相结合的原则，而走资本主义道路，就是否定科学事业应该为国家社会主义建设服务，提倡为科学而科学，主张科学家可以不顾国家需要单凭个人兴趣来进行研究工作。在发展科学事业中，走社会主义的道路就是要有计划、要有组织、要有领导，这就是说，应该制订发展科学事业的远景计划、年度计划，要有重点同时又要照顾全面，要根据工作需要该集中人力来做的就要集中，该分散进行的就应该有意识地分散，要加强分工和协作，要有统一的领导。而走资本主义道路则反对订科学工作的计划，并且认为对科学工作根本不能订计划，主张无条件地分散，认为不需要统一的领导。在发展科学事业中，走社会主义的道路，就是一定要有党对科学工作的领导，而走资本主义道路则反对党对科学工作的领导，认为党不能领导科学工作。前一条道路就是我们现在正在走着的道路，我国大多数科学家也是赞成走这条道路的。几年来我国在科学事业中取得的成绩正证明了这条道路的正确。今后我们还要继续走这条道路。主张走后一条道路的可以民盟反社会主义的科学纲领作代表。在我国科学家中有一些人，还不了解我国有必要走社会主义这条道路或不习惯走这条道路，这并不奇怪，因为他们所受的是资产阶级教育和长期在资本主义制度下工作和生活。这一些人经过思想教育和工作实践是会逐渐改变这种观点的，事实上其中有些科学家已经或正在改变他们的观点。但是资产阶级右派分子却利用这些科学家的弱点，别有用心地发展和助长这些错误观点，引导科学家走向错误的道路上去，从而破坏我们的科学事业。
    右派分子敌视社会主义道路  科学家必须站稳社会主义立场
    聂荣臻指出，右派分子的反动纲领是以对有关科学体制问题提供意见的方式提出来的。其实完全不是那么一回事。对这点郭沫若院长早就揭穿了。可是有的右派分子被揭露后，在他们作检讨时，仿佛人民批判他们，仅仅是因为他们对工作不该提出这种或那种意见，这种说法是必需予以驳斥的。任何善意的意见和批评，一向都是为我们所欢迎的。右派分子的言论之所以必须反对，决不是由于他们提供了意见，而是因为右派分子的这些言论包含了对社会主义的深厚的敌意，是因为他们企图反对社会主义，反对共产党领导，篡夺国家领导权。
    聂荣臻指出，这次会议是在反右派深入开展的时候召开的。几个月来，右派分子有计划地向科学界散布很多反动的言论，挑拨科学家、青年同政府间的关系，挑拨科学家之间的关系。他们兴风作浪，唯恐科学界不乱。这是他们反对社会主义活动的一个重要方面。在科学领域内，对右派分子的这一进攻，给以有力的反击，这是保卫我们社会主义的科学事业。科学界目前正在对曾昭抡、钱伟长等右派分子进行彻底的揭露和批判，这是完全必要的。
    聂荣臻说：在这一场同资产阶级右派的斗争中，更加看出知识分子进行自我思想改造的必要。一个科学家如果不能明确地站到社会主义立场，就有可能被人民的敌人所利用。这样，即使他有丰富的知识，不但不能对人民有贡献，甚至对国家造成损失。他说，应当承认，在我国科学家中不少人的资产阶级思想还是相当浓厚的。在他们的头脑中，站在资产阶级的立场还是站在无产阶级立场的问题，并没有得到解决，辩证唯物主义的世界观还没有建立。这种状况，既妨碍科学家本人更好地为社会主义建设服务，又会给青年以不良的影响。教育者必须受教育，科学家就应努力改造自己，使自己成为真正的人民科学家。这需要长期艰苦的努力。在目前来说，最有效的思想改造方式是积极地参加反右派的斗争。反右派斗争是一次生动的丰富的马克思主义思想教育运动。希望科学家能积极参加这一运动，并在斗争中锻炼自己。
    聂荣臻最后表示，各学会的主要任务是团结本学科的研究工作者通过各种学术讨论会、座谈会、刊物等，来推动科学研究工作。他希望学会这个作用今后进一步发挥起来，贯彻百家争鸣的方针，使学术活动更加活跃起来。国务院科学规划委员会将尽力支持各专门学会和科联的工作。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在上午的会上也讲了话。
