Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 21st: Closely following the bumper harvest of summer crops such as wheat, good news of a bumper harvest of 3.4 million mu of early rice in Hubei Province is frequently being reported. In the past few days, agricultural cooperative members in Huanggang and Xiaogan prefectures, where the early rice matured earlier, have been harvesting busily in the scorching heat; in Jingzhou Prefecture, where the season is slightly later, members are preparing their sickles and baskets, and harvesting activities will be fully underway within two or three days. According to reports from various places to the provincial agricultural department, the average yield per mu of the province's 3.4 million mu of early rice is estimated to reach 400 jin, and the total early rice harvest is expected to increase by 10% compared to last year. Xiaogan Prefecture, the main early rice producing area, and Xiangyang Prefecture in northern Hubei, which only began to trial-plant double-cropping rice after cooperativization, have an average early rice yield of around 500 to 600 jin per mu this year.

    湖北早稻可增产一成
    据新华社武汉21日电  紧跟着小麦等夏收作物的丰收，湖北省三百四十万亩早稻丰收的捷报又频频传来。最近这几天，早稻成熟较早的黄冈和孝感专区的农业社社员们，正冒着酷暑紧张收割；季节稍晚的荆州专区，社员们正在收拾镰刀箩筐，收割活动在三两天内也要全面铺开。从各地向省农业部门汇报的情况看：全省三百四十万亩早稻平均亩产估计能达到四百斤，预计比去年全省的早稻收成增产一成。早稻主要产地——孝感专区和合作化后才开始试种双季稻的鄂北襄阳专区，今年早稻平均亩产都在五、六百斤上下。（附图片）
