On Foreign Trade
Ye Jizhuang's Speech

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1956 National Final Accounts and the 1957 National Budget Draft," and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Implementation Results of the 1956 National Economic Plan and the 1957 National Economic Plan Draft." I will now provide some explanations regarding the situation and several issues in foreign trade.

Main Situation of Import and Export Trade

Regarding the main situation of import and export trade and several issues:

The actual total value of import and export trade in 1956 was 10.865 billion yuan, of which imports were 5.297 billion yuan and exports were 5.568 billion yuan.

The planned total value of import and export trade for 1957 is 9.955 billion yuan, a decrease of 8.4 percent compared to the actual performance of the previous year, of which imports are 4.755 billion yuan, a decrease of 10.2 percent compared to the actual performance of the previous year, and exports are 5.2 billion yuan, a decrease of 6.6 percent compared to the actual performance of the previous year.

The planned import and export amount for 1957 is lower than the actual performance of 1956. This is because agricultural production in some areas was reduced due to disasters in 1956, making the supply of export goods more difficult. However, if we can complete according to the above plan, we can still exceed the first Five-Year Plan for import and export by the end of this year. The cumulative total import and export value for the five years will exceed the Five-Year Plan by 6.4 percent, of which imports will exceed by 8 percent and exports will exceed by 4.8 percent.

Foreign trade is a component of our national economy. It must be subordinate to the requirements of the overall national economic plan and adapt to the development of the national economy.

In the past few years, agricultural products and processed agricultural products have accounted for about 75 percent of our total export value, while mineral products and industrial products such as machinery have accounted for about 25 percent. Since the speed of agricultural production increase is currently limited by the area of cultivated land and the impact of natural disasters, and at the same time, the people's purchasing power is gradually increasing, the demand for several major agricultural products in the domestic market is increasing. Therefore, the relationship between domestic sales and exports of various major commodities must be properly arranged. Regarding this issue, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council made principled regulations in 1954. The main spirit is: commodities that are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood and are in relatively tight supply in the domestic market, such as grain and oil, must be strictly limited for export according to regulations; some commodities, although related to the people's lives, are not urgently needed by the people for consumption at present, and the sales volume in the domestic market can be increased or decreased as appropriate, and domestic sales should be appropriately reduced to supply exports; some commodities, which are not necessary for the current lives of the vast majority of people and have little impact on domestic market sales, should be given priority for export, and the surplus should be supplied for domestic sales. This principle of handling takes into account the long-term interests of the people and also takes into account the current living needs of the people. In recent years, we have basically arranged the export volume of various commodities according to this principle. In the second half of last year, due to the relatively tight supply of edible oil and pork in the domestic market, we reduced the export of pork by 50,000 tons according to the instructions of the State Council. In order to take care of the needs of the people's lives, the export volume of several major commodities has been reduced in this year's export plan, such as grain reduced by 540,000 tons compared to last year, edible vegetable oil reduced by 100,000 tons, pork and live pigs reduced by 85,000 tons, and cotton yarn reduced by 12,209 pieces, etc. At the same time, due to the increase in the export of mineral products, industrial products, handicrafts, and various small local products, this year still maintains a considerable export volume, which can appropriately meet the import of important equipment needed for national construction, major raw materials for industrial and agricultural production, and certain market necessities.

In the future, with the development of China's industry and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the proportion of major agricultural products in the total export value will gradually decrease, while the proportion of mineral products and industrial products will gradually increase. We are planning to gradually increase the export of various mineral products, animal products, aquatic products, certain tropical and subtropical crops, certain industrial products, and handicrafts, and will continue to increase the production of silk, tea, and other traditional Chinese export commodities. Within the scope of China's production, design, and technical capabilities, we will continue to appropriately organize the export of a portion of machinery and complete sets of industrial equipment according to foreign needs, and will strengthen the organization of the export of certain products processed with imported raw materials under possible conditions.

On the import side, the import orders required by all parties in the past few years have been specifically arranged according to the control numbers allocated by the state to various departments and the approved import lists. In the past few years, machines and various equipment have accounted for about 60 percent of the total import value, and raw materials for industrial and agricultural production, such as hardware, chemical raw materials, cotton, rubber, fertilizers, etc., as well as certain market necessities such as medicine, kerosene, and sugar, have accounted for about 40 percent, which basically meets the needs of national economic development. However, due to the limited foreign exchange, our lack of experience, and difficulties in foreign supply, some imported materials have not fully met the requirements of various departments and regions in terms of variety, quantity, quality, and delivery time; and there are still inappropriate aspects in taking into account and arranging the needs of construction, production, and the market. This year, due to the reduction in export volume, the import plan has been reduced compared to last year in order to ensure the balance of import and export. However, this year, on the import side, due to the reduction in the import of general machinery, the import amount of raw materials for industrial and agricultural production and market materials can be increased compared to last year, in addition to the industrial equipment necessary to ensure the completion of the economic construction of the first Five-Year Plan. With the development of China's economy, the proportion of machinery and equipment in the total import value will gradually decrease, and the proportion of certain raw materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and several daily necessities needed by the people will gradually increase.

This change in the proportion of import and export commodity categories in the development of China's economic construction is inevitable and reasonable, but this change is gradual.

Now I want to talk about several issues of concern to the delegates.

(1) The issue of grain and oil exports.

Before liberation, China was a grain importing country. After liberation, with the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production, it has transformed into a country that can export a portion of grain. The quantity of grain exported in the past few years (excluding soybeans): 900,000 tons in 1953, 800,000 tons in 1954, 1 million tons in 1955, and 1.32 million tons in 1956. The planned export of grain this year is 780,000 tons. At present, China trades with many countries, which requires a certain amount of exports and a variety of export products. Especially in the case of barter trade, it is necessary to export a portion of grain in exchange for the materials needed by China, according to the needs and possibilities of mutual exchange. For example, China's trade with Ceylon is to exchange China's rice for Ceylon's rubber.

Soybeans are China's traditional large-scale export commodity. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the annual export was about 2 million tons, and the export volume in 1929 reached 2.5 million tons. Now the annual export is only about 1 million tons. In order to exchange for the foreign exchange needed for imports, and to implement the principle of equality and mutual benefit in trade, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate amount of soybean exports at present.

Some representatives advocated not exporting soybeans and peanut kernels, but instead exporting soybean oil and peanut oil, in order to leave peanut cake and soybean cake as feed and fertilizer. This idea is good. We believe that the method of exporting less peanut kernels and more peanut oil is worth considering; as for replacing soybean exports with soybean oil, because many countries now only want to buy soybeans but not soybean oil, it cannot fully meet our above requirements; and the foreign exchange earned by exporting one ton of soybeans is about twice as much as the foreign exchange earned by exporting one ton of soybean oil after it is pressed from soybeans, leaving soybean cake reduces foreign exchange earnings. From the perspective of solving the state's foreign exchange source, it is still cost-effective to export a portion of soybeans at present.

(2) Regarding the issue of importing cotton and exporting cotton cloth.

Some representatives suggested that more cotton should be imported, processed, and then cotton cloth should be exported, so that the production potential of China's cotton textile industry can be fully utilized. This suggestion is correct in principle. In fact, we have done this in the past few years. We import a portion of cotton and export cotton cloth and cotton knitwear every year. However, the sales volume of cotton cloth in the international market is limited. From the perspective of 1955 and 1956, the total output of cotton cloth in the capitalist international market is about 5 billion square yards per year. Among the exporting countries, Japan exports about 1.2 billion square yards per year, India exports more than 700 million square yards, and the United Kingdom and the United States each export about 500 million square yards. It is heard that Japan and India are preparing to increase cotton cloth exports this year, and textile products from other countries have also entered the international market in recent years. The sales competition of cotton cloth in the international market is very fierce. China's cotton cloth is mainly exported to Southeast Asian countries, and the sales volume accounts for about one-third of the annual cotton cloth input of Southeast Asian countries. Recently, the textile industry in Southeast Asian cotton cloth importing countries is also developing year by year, and the input volume is decreasing. Although it is possible to increase China's cotton cloth exports with further efforts, it is limited. In short, the principle of importing raw materials and exporting finished products is correct, and we are planning to gradually work in this direction under possible conditions. In addition to the relevant departments carrying out this work, some foreign exchange funds have been allocated to certain ports and provinces this year in order to gradually develop this work.

(3) Regarding the import of scientific instruments and chemical reagents.

In recent years, the import quantity of scientific instruments and chemical reagents has been considerable. From 1952 to 1956, the total import value reached 386 million yuan, and the planned import this year is 98 million yuan. The total import for six years is 484 million yuan, with an average annual import of more than 80 million yuan, equivalent to more than 30 million US dollars. According to China's customs statistics, before the Anti-Japanese War, from 1933 to 1937, the annual import of scientific instruments and chemical reagents was worth about 3 million US dollars; before liberation, from 1946 to 1948, the annual import of scientific instruments and chemical reagents was only 1.7 million US dollars to 2.5 million US dollars. Even if the factor of US dollar devaluation is added, the import amount of scientific instruments and chemical reagents is now about five times larger than before the Anti-Japanese War, and ten times larger than in the few years before liberation. In recent years, many of the instruments we have imported are precision and valuable instruments, such as electron microscopes, spectrometers, various electronic testing instruments (including microwave instruments), nuclear research instruments, aerial surveying instruments, X-ray machines for crystal analysis, ultracentrifuges, autoclaves, etc. Since the state called for marching towards science last year, the instruments and chemical reagents needed for scientific research and industrial construction have increased a lot in terms of both variety and quantity. The actual import amount in 1956 reached 110 million yuan. It can be seen that the State Council has seriously taken care of the working conditions of scientific researchers. However, due to the large number of ordering units and their dispersal, the allocation of foreign exchange is not appropriate enough, the allocation amount for some scientific research units is small, the ordering procedures are complicated, and the business experience and scientific and technological knowledge of cadres engaged in instrument ordering are insufficient. In addition, there are indeed difficulties in purchasing some instruments and reagents from abroad, so in terms of variety, quantity, and delivery time, especially for some scattered orders, the needs of scientific research cannot be fully met. We have taken and are continuing to take measures to improve efforts. As for whether the foreign exchange amount for scientific research institutions to order instruments can be increased, it will be appropriately resolved according to the specific situation when arranging the import plan for the next year. It is also suggested that similar instruments, especially some very valuable precision instruments, should be used in a coordinated manner by various scientific research units in an industrial base or a city to avoid the situation where they are needed in one place but idle in another.

(4) Regarding the import of watches.

Some representatives believe that we import too many watches. In fact, the amount of money we import watches every year is not large. For example, the planned import of watches this year is 500,000 pieces, and the amount only accounts for 2 per thousand of the total import amount. It should also be explained that the watches we import are only general-purpose watches, not luxury watches. They are needed by government cadres, scientists, engineers, medical personnel, teachers, and the vast number of workers and staff. They all demand more imports. In recent years, watches have been in short supply in the domestic market. Therefore, it is still necessary to appropriately import a portion of watches according to the foreign exchange situation. It is beneficial to meet the needs of the domestic market and withdraw currency.

Situation of Import and Export Commodity Prices

Now I would like to talk about the situation of China's import and export commodity prices.

As everyone knows, in the old China era, China's domestic market prices were directly linked to capitalist international market prices. The fluctuations of international market prices had a decisive impact on domestic market prices. In the era of monopoly capitalism, the direct link between domestic and foreign prices was very unfavorable to the national economy of backward agricultural countries like China. Not only did it deprive China's national industry of protection, but it also forced Chinese farmers to sell their products to foreign merchants and their agents at prices lower than their actual value. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, foreign trade control and protection trade policies were implemented, and domestic market prices were separated from international market prices, so that domestic prices were not affected by the fluctuations of capitalist international market prices. This is of great benefit to stabilizing China's agricultural and sideline product prices, protecting China's industry from the threat of free dumping of foreign industrial products, and developing China's economy.

When China trades with capitalist countries, the prices of import and export commodities are calculated according to capitalist international market prices. Because China implements the method of separating domestic and foreign prices, the foreign prices of imported and exported commodities are converted into RMB according to the exchange rate. Compared with domestic prices, there is generally a certain difference, which is manifested as a loss in exports and a surplus in imports. However, we purchase agricultural and sideline products and industrial products for export in China at domestic prices, so farmers and industrial production units do not bear the losses of exports; some imported commodities are allocated to the ordering departments at the imported cost plus a 2 or 3 percent handling fee according to the method of agency import, and some are allocated to commercial departments according to the agreement price between the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Commerce. The difference between the domestic and foreign prices of import and export commodities is calculated by the state as a whole, and the difference between the domestic and foreign prices of imported commodities is used to offset the difference between the domestic and foreign prices of exported commodities.

Some representatives mentioned whether the sales prices of imported commodities in the domestic market are too high. Since the foreign exchange we need for imports is mainly exchanged for export goods, as mentioned above, according to the current exchange rate, there are generally losses in exports to capitalist countries. Therefore, when determining the domestic market price of imported commodities, in addition to calculating taxes and operating costs, the losses in exports should also be balanced; more importantly, the domestic sales price of imported commodities must appropriately take care of the production costs of similar domestic products in order to protect domestic production. Therefore, it is reasonable for the domestic sales price of imported commodities to be higher than the imported cost at present. Our ministry adopts the agency method for the import of complete sets of industrial equipment, most machines, industrial raw materials, and instruments. Each import company only charges a handling fee of 2 or 3 percent of the import cost. For these agency-imported goods, the state finances actually provide exchange rate subsidies. Of course, the domestic sales prices of some imported commodities are indeed too high, and relevant departments are paying attention to research and will make appropriate adjustments.

Trade between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is conducted on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual exchange, and mutual assistance and cooperation. The pricing in trade must also conform to this principle. Although the trade prices between China and the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries need to refer to the price level of the capitalist international market, they cannot be completely based on the prices of the capitalist international market. Because the prices of the capitalist international market are affected by various factors such as monopoly, speculation, and even war and economic crisis, they often fluctuate, and sometimes they fluctuate very violently, while trade between socialist countries must avoid being affected by this. On the other hand, it is not appropriate for trade between socialist countries to use the domestic prices of either of the trading countries to price at present, because the domestic prices of various socialist countries are currently determined according to various economic and political factors in their own countries, and the level of production technology in each country is not the same. The pricing principle for trade between China and various fraternal countries at present is: the prices of commodities exchanged by both parties are determined through consultation between the two governments with reference to the price level of the capitalist international market. This commodity price agreed upon by both parties is unchanged and stable within a certain period of validity, avoiding the impact of frequent fluctuations in capitalist international market prices.

Taking the pricing in China's trade with the Soviet Union as an example, the pricing principle of Sino-Soviet trade was stipulated in the first trade agreement signed by the Chinese and Soviet governments on April 19, 1950. The specific prices of various import and export goods agreed upon at that time were determined through consultation between the two parties with reference to the prices of the capitalist international market at that time (China's internal conversion method for rubles and RMB was also formulated according to the foreign exchange exchange rate of the People's Bank of China at that time, which is what we now call "trade rubles"). This pricing principle has not changed for seven years, and only the prices of several individual commodities are adjusted as necessary by agreement between the two parties each year. Therefore, although the prices of commodities in the capitalist international market have fluctuated greatly in recent years, the trade prices between China and the Soviet Union have been able to remain stable. This is of great benefit to the planned economic construction of both countries.

If the main commodities exported by China to the Soviet Union and imported from the Soviet Union are calculated according to the prices of the capitalist international market, the price changes from 1956 compared to 1950 are as follows: Among the commodities exported by China to the Soviet Union, the prices of wool, rice, tung oil, and jute have fallen by 10 to 30 percent, and the prices of soybeans, black tea, raw silk, tin, and tungsten sand have risen by 10 to 160 percent; Among the commodities imported by China from the Soviet Union, the prices of diesel and gasoline have not changed much, and the prices of mechanical equipment, thick steel plates, and structural steel have risen by 30 to 140 percent. Especially in 1951 and 1952, the prices of commodities in the capitalist international market fluctuated greatly. However, from 1950 to 1956, the prices of commodities exchanged between China and the Soviet Union have been calculated according to the agreement prices in April 1950, and only necessary adjustments have been made to the prices of certain commodities, so it has been able to maintain stability.

Of course, if the Sino-Soviet contract price of a specific commodity or two is compared with the price of the capitalist international market at a certain time, it may be high or low. For example, the export price of soybeans from China to the Soviet Union is 380 rubles per ton, which is lower than the price of the capitalist international market; for example, the export price of rice from China to the Soviet Union is 560 rubles per ton, which was slightly lower than the price of the capitalist international market in 1952 and 1953, but was much higher than the price of the capitalist international market in 1950, 1951, 1954, 1955, and 1956; for example, the export price of tin from China to the Soviet Union was 6,400 rubles per ton in 1950, which was adjusted to 11,600 rubles from 1951, and then adjusted to 8,116 rubles in 1956, which is roughly the same as or slightly higher than the tin price of the capitalist international market in previous years; for example, the price of thick steel plates imported by China from the Soviet Union in the capitalist international market from 1951 to 1956 (converted to the same quality): the highest was 206.8 US dollars per ton, and the lowest was 104.5 US dollars, while the import price from the Soviet Union has always been 402 rubles per ton, equivalent to 100.5 US dollars. If all import and export commodities over the past few years are calculated according to the prices of the capitalist international market, the trade prices between China and the Soviet Union are basically fair and reasonable. Moreover, on our side, we must take into account the situation where the United States and some other capitalist countries have imposed a so-called "embargo" on China. If the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries did not supply China with certain essential imported materials, then we would have to buy from the monopoly merchants of capitalist countries at a very high price, and some commodities would be difficult to buy even at a high price. For example, the Soviet Union tries its best to meet China's needs for various high-quality steel products; for example, in 1956, we imported a small amount of nickel from capitalist countries, and the price we paid was more than twice as high as the price imported from the Soviet Union. Therefore, the trade prices between socialist countries cannot be calculated based on one or two specific commodities alone. All import and export commodities over the past few years must be calculated as a whole, and then we can know that the interests of both parties have been taken into account, and it is fair and reasonable. Generally speaking, our side has not suffered any losses in the trade prices between China and the Soviet Union in recent years, but it is fair and reasonable.

Some representatives do not have enough understanding of the specific situation of Sino-Soviet trade pricing and raised several questions, which should be explained. However, the rightists deliberately distort the Soviet Union's sincere help to our country; and praise and publicize the United States, which is an enemy of the Chinese people, in many ways. What kind of stance is this? This is worthy of our great vigilance.

Development Direction of Foreign Trade

Finally, I would also like to explain the issue of the development direction of China's foreign trade relations.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the policy of developing trade with all countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In recent years, China's trade relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have been increasingly consolidated and developed. In 1956, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries accounted for 75 percent of China's total foreign trade volume. It has always been the basic and main part of China's foreign trade, and it is also a solid and reliable foundation for China to develop foreign trade. The Soviet Union and the fraternal countries of Eastern Europe have designed and equipped hundreds of large-scale modern industrial enterprises of various types for China, and have provided scientific and technological assistance to China. Their assistance has played a major role in the rapid development of China's socialist construction cause. In the future, we will continue to consolidate and develop trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and further strengthen mutual economic cooperation to promote the common upsurge of the economies of socialist countries. This is the firm and unshakable policy of China's development of foreign trade relations.

In recent years, China's trade relations with Asian and African countries have also developed greatly. These countries advocate peace and demand the development of independent and autonomous national economies. Some of these countries have traditional trade relations with China. The restoration of this traditional trade is needed by both parties. In the future, China will continue to further develop trade with Asian and African countries in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. With the economic development of China and various Asian and African countries, the basis for developing trade exchanges between us will become increasingly broad and expanded.

We have always adopted a positive attitude towards trade with Western countries. Although the US government has imposed a so-called "embargo" on China and forced other countries to adopt trade discrimination policies against China, China's trade with many Western countries has still developed year by year, but due to the fact that some Western countries have followed the United States in implementing the "embargo" policy, trade relations cannot be normalized. Recently, Western countries such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, West Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Luxembourg have relaxed the "embargo" on China, which is a positive step towards developing normal international trade. However, these countries have not completely abandoned the trade discrimination policy against China, and still maintain more than 200 so-called "embargo" key items. Such as new industrial equipment, large and precision machines, precision bearings, precision instruments, certain communication equipment, fast ships, floating docks, petroleum products, copper ingots, certain alloys, certain electrical materials, certain chemical industrial products, etc., are still listed on the "embargo" list. If these "embargo" items are not lifted, there is no doubt that it will still be a major obstacle to the development of normal trade. For example, selling cars but not selling gasoline, selling diesel engines but not selling diesel, will inevitably greatly limit the development of trade. At the same time, from the perspective of the conditions for conducting trade, China's trade with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is truly established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Both parties adopt the method of barter, and import and export can maintain balance. There are many mutually convenient common conditions in transportation, settlement, and payment, etc. When problems arise, they can be reasonably resolved through friendly consultation. At present, China's trade with Western countries still lacks such convenient conditions. In addition, due to the obstruction of the "embargo," China's trade exchanges with some Western countries have been greatly restricted in recent years. It will also take some time to understand and familiarize ourselves with their production situation, product technology, performance, and supply possibilities. However, even so, we believe that if Western countries can take positive measures that are conducive to the development of trade, China's trade with some Western countries still has development prospects.

Dear delegates, I hope you will regularly inspect, assist, criticize, and advise the work of the foreign trade department!

    谈对外贸易
    叶季壮的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算草案的报告”和薄一波副总理“关于一九五六年度国民经济计划的执行结果和一九五七年度国民经济计划草案的报告”。我现在把对外贸易工作方面的情况和若干问题作一些说明。
    进出口贸易的主要情况
    关于进出口贸易的主要情况和几个问题。
    一九五六年进出口贸易总额实绩为一百零八点六五亿元，其中进口五十二点九七亿元，出口五十五点六八亿元。
    一九五七年计划进出口贸易总额九十九点五五亿元，比上年实绩减少百分之八点四，其中进口四十七点五五亿元，比上年实绩减少百分之十点二，出口五十二亿元，比上年实绩减少百分之六点六。
    一九五七年的进出口计划金额比一九五六年实绩减少，这是因为一九五六年某些地区农业因灾减产，出口物资供应比较困难。但是如果能够按照上述计划完成，到今年年底仍然可以超额完成第一个五年进出口计划，五年累计进出口总额将超过五年计划百分之六点四，其中进口超过百分之八，出口超过百分之四点八。
    对外贸易是我国国民经济的一个组成部分。它必须服从整个国民经济计划的要求，同国民经济的发展相适应。
    过去几年，在我国出口总额中，农产品和农产加工品约占百分之七十五左右，矿产品和机械等工业品约占百分之二十五。由于目前农业增产的速度受着耕地面积的限制和自然灾害的影响，同时由于人民购买力逐步提高，国内市场对若干种主要农产品的需要日益增长，因而对于各种主要商品的内销和出口关系，必须妥善地加以安排。关于这个问题，中共中央和国务院在一九五四年即有原则规定，主要的精神是：凡与国计民生关系重大、国内市场供应又比较紧张的商品，如粮食、油料之类，必须严格地按照规定限量出口；有些商品，虽然与人民生活有关，但目前人民消费需要还不是十分迫切，国内市场销售数量可多可少的，应该适当地压缩国内销售，供应出口；有些商品，不是当前广大人民生活所必需，对国内市场销售影响不大的，应该尽先供应出口，多余的再供内销。这个处理原则，既照顾到人民的长远利益，又照顾到人民当前的生活需要。几年来我们基本上是按照这个原则安排各种商品的出口数量的。去年下半年由于国内市场上食油、猪肉供应比较紧张，我们曾经按照国务院的指示，削减了出口猪肉五万吨。为了照顾人民生活的需要，在今年出口计划中，又减少了若干种主要商品的出口数量，如粮食比去年减少五十四万吨，食用植物油减少十万吨，猪肉和活猪减少八万五千吨，棉纱减少一万二千二百零九件等，同时由于增加了矿产品、工业品、手工业品和各种小土产的出口，所以今年仍然保持了相当的出口额，能够适当地满足国家建设所需要的重要设备、工农业生产的主要原材料和某些市场必需物资的进口。
    今后，随着我国工业的发展和人民生活的日渐提高，在出口总额中，主要农产品所占的比重将逐渐下降，矿产品和工业品所占的比重则将逐渐增长。我们正在计划逐步地增加各种矿产品、畜产品、水产品、某些热带和亚热带作物、某些工业品和手工业品的出口，并将继续增产丝绸、茶叶等我国传统出口的商品，在我国生产、设计和技术能力所及的范围内，根据国外的需要，将继续适当地组织一部分机器和工业成套设备出口，并且将在可能条件下加强组织某些用进口原料加工的产品出口。
    进口方面，几年来对各方面所需要的进口订货，是根据国家分配给各部门的控制数和批准的进口货单具体安排的。过去几年，在进口总额中，机器和各种设备约占百分之六十，工农业生产的原材料如五金、化工原料、棉花、橡胶、肥田粉等以及某些市场需要物资如医药、煤油、食糖等约占百分之四十，基本上是适应国民经济发展的需要的。但是由于外汇有一定的限度，我们的经验不足，以及国外供应上有困难，有些进口物资，在品种上、数量上、质量上和到货时间上还未能完全适应各部门和各地区的要求；对建设、生产、市场三方面需要的兼顾和安排，还有不够恰当的地方。今年由于出口额减少，为了确保进出口的平衡，进口计划比去年有所缩减。但是，今年在进口方面，由于减少了一般机械的进口，因此，除了为保证完成第一个五年计划经济建设所必需的工业设备以外，对于工农业生产原材料和市场物资的进口金额还能比去年有所增加。随着我国经济的发展，今后在进口总额中，机械和设备所占的比重将逐渐减少，工农业生产所需要的某些原材料和人民生活需要的若干日用品所占的比重将逐渐增加。
    在我国经济建设发展中，进出口商品类别比重上的这种变化是必然的、合理的，但这种变化是逐渐的。
    下面我要谈谈代表们所关心的几个问题。
    （一）粮食和油料出口问题。
    我国在解放前是粮食进口国家，解放后随着农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，转变为可以出口一部分粮食。过去几年粮食出口数量（不包括大豆）：一九五三年为九十万吨，一九五四年八十万吨，一九五五年一百万吨，一九五六年一百三十二万吨。今年计划出口粮食七十八万吨。目前我国同许多国家进行贸易，需要有一定的出口额和多样的出口品种。特别是在进行易货贸易的情形下，根据双方互通有无的需要和可能，出口一部分粮食，换回我国必需的物资，是必要的。例如我国同锡兰的贸易，就是用我国的大米交换锡兰的橡胶。
    大豆是我国传统的大宗出口商品，抗日战争前每年出口约二百万吨，一九二九年出口数量曾达二百五十万吨，现在每年只出口一百万吨左右。为了换回进口所需外汇，为了贯彻执行平等互利的贸易原则，在目前仍然维持适当数量的大豆出口，是有必要的。
    有些代表主张不出口大豆和花生仁，改为出口豆油和花生油，为的是留下花生饼和豆饼作饲料和肥料。这种想法是好的。我们认为少出口花生仁多出口花生油的办法，是值得考虑的；至于以豆油代替大豆出口，因为现在许多国家只愿买大豆而不愿买豆油，不能完全适合我们上述的要求；而且出口一吨大豆所收入的外汇，比用一吨大豆榨成豆油后出口所收入的外汇约多二倍，留下豆饼减少了外汇收入。从解决国家外汇来源上看，目前出口一部分大豆还是合算的。
    （二）关于进口棉花出口棉布问题。
    有的代表建议应该多进口棉花，加工后出口棉布，使我国棉纺织业的生产潜力能够尽量发挥。这个建议原则上是对的。事实上，过去几年我们已经这样做了。我们每年进口一部分棉花，出口棉布和棉针织品。但是国际市场棉布销量是有一定限度的。从一九五五、一九五六两年来看，资本主义国际市场棉布总输出量大约每年五十亿平方码左右，输出国家中，日本每年输出约十二亿平方码，印度七亿余平方码，英国、美国各约五亿余平方码。据闻今年日本和印度都准备增加棉布输出，还有其它国家的棉织品近年来也已投入国际市场，棉布在国际市场上的销售竞争是十分激烈的。我国棉布目前主要是输往东南亚各国，销售量约占东南亚各国每年棉布输入量的三分之一左右。近来东南亚棉布输入国家的纺织业也正在逐年发展，输入量有减少的趋势。我国棉布出口再经努力虽然还有可能增加，但是有一定的限度。总之，进口原料出口成品的原则是对的，我们正在有计划地在可能的条件下逐步向这方面努力。除了有关各部门进行这项工作之外，今年曾拨付一些外汇基金给某些口岸和省份，以便逐渐发展这项工作。
    （三）关于科学仪器和化学试剂的进口问题。
    几年来，科学仪器和化学试剂的进口数量是不少的。从一九五二年到一九五六年，进口总额达三亿八千六百万元，今年计划进口九千八百万元，六年合计进口四亿八千四百万元，平均每年进口八千多万元，折合三千多万美元。根据我国海关统计资料，在抗日战争前从一九三三年到一九三七年，每年进口的科学仪器和化学试剂约值三百万美元左右；解放前从一九四六年到一九四八年，每年进口的科学仪器和化学试剂不过一百七十万美元至二百五十万美元，即使加上美元贬值的因素，现在科学仪器和化学试剂的进口金额比抗日战争前约大五倍，比解放前几年则大十倍。最近几年，我们进口的仪器中有不少是精密和贵重的仪器，如电子显微镜、光谱仪、各种电子测验仪器（包括微波用仪器）、核子研究用仪器、航空测量仪器、结晶分析用X光机、超速离心机、高压釜等。自去年国家号召向科学进军以来，科学研究方面及工业建设方面所需要的仪器和化学试剂不论在品种上和数量上都增加了很多，一九五六年度实际进口金额达一亿一千万元。由此可见，国务院是认真照顾到科学研究工作者的工作条件的。但是由于订购单位多而分散，外汇分配得不够恰当，对于某些科学研究单位的分配额较少，订货手续繁多，以及从事仪器订货的干部的业务经验和科学技术知识不足等原因，加以有些仪器和试剂在向国外购买时确实也有困难，因而在品种上、数量上和到货时间上，尤其是某些零星的订货，还不能完全满足科学研究方面的需要。我们已经并且正在继续采取措施努力改进。至于能否增加科学研究机关订购仪器的外汇额问题，在安排下年度进口计划时，当根据具体情况适当解决。并建议在一个工业基地或一个城市中，同类的仪器，特别是某些很贵重的精密仪器，各科学研究单位希能调剂使用，避免此处需要，彼处闲置。
    （四）关于手表进口问题。
    有的代表认为我们进口手表多了。事实上我们每年进口手表的金额并不算大，例如今年计划进口手表五十万只，其金额只占进口总额千分之二。并且应该说明，我们进口的手表，只是通用手表，而不是高贵手表，是机关干部、科学家、工程师、医务人员、教员和广大职工所需要的，他们都要求更多地进口，几年来在国内市场上，手表供不应求。因此，根据外汇情况适当进口一部分手表还是需要的。对于供应国内市场需要和回笼货币，是有一定好处的。
    进出口商品价格的情况
    现在我想谈一下我国进出口商品价格的情况。
    大家知道，旧中国时代，我国国内市场价格是同资本主义国际市场价格有直接联系的，国际市场价格的波动，对国内市场价格有决定性的影响。在垄断资本主义时代，对于像我国这样的落后的农业国家，国内外价格的直接联系，对国民经济非常不利。不但使我国民族工业失却保护，并且使我国农民被迫以低于实际价值的价格，向外国商人及其代理人出售自己的产品。中华人民共和国成立后，实行了对外贸易管制和保护贸易政策，并且把国内市场价格同国际市场价格分开，使国内价格不受资本主义国际市场价格波动的影响。这样，对稳定我国农副产品价格，对保护我国工业不受外国工业品自由倾销的威胁，对我国经济的发展，有很大的好处。
    我国同资本主义国家进行贸易，进出口商品的价格是按照资本主义国际市场价格计算的。由于我国实行把国内外价格分开的办法，所以进口和出口商品的国外价格按外汇比率折合成人民币以后，同国内价格比较，一般的都有一定的差额，表现为出口有亏损，进口有盈余。但是我们在国内收购出口的农副产品和工业品，则是按照国内价格购买的，所以农民和工业生产单位并没有负担出口的亏损；进口商品中，有的按照代理进口的办法按进口成本加百分之二、三手续费拨交订货部门，有的按照对外贸易部同商业部协议价格拨交商业部门。进出口商品的国内外价格差额是由国家统盘核算的，是用进口商品的国内外价格差额抵补出口商品的国内外价格差额的。
    有些代表提到进口商品在国内市场的销售价格是不是过高的问题。由于我们进口所需外汇主要是用出口物资换来的，如上所述，按照现行汇率，对资本主义国家出口，一般都有亏损，因此在确定进口商品国内市场售价时，除了计算税收和经营费用以外，还应当平衡出口方面的亏损；更重要的是进口商品在国内的售价必须适当地照顾国内同样产品的生产成本，以保护国内的生产。因此，目前进口商品在国内的售价高于进口成本，是合理的。我部对于工业成套设备、大部分机器、工业原料和仪器的进口，都采用代理的办法，各进口公司只按进口成本，加收百分之二或三的手续费。对于这些代理进口的货物，实际上是由国家财政方面给了汇率上补贴的。当然，某些进口商品的国内售价确实也有偏高的，有关部门正在注意研究，并将加以适当调整。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家间的贸易，是根据平等互利、互通有无、互助合作的原则进行的，贸易上的作价，也必须符合这个原则。我国同苏联和其他兄弟国家间的贸易价格虽然需要参考资本主义国际市场的价格水平，但是不能完全按照资本主义国际市场的价格。因为资本主义国际市场价格受垄断、投机以至战争、经济危机等等各种因素的影响，经常波动不定，有时并且波动得十分剧烈，而社会主义国家间的贸易，必须避免受到这种影响。另一方面，社会主义各国之间的贸易，在目前也不宜采用贸易双方国家任何一方的国内价格来计价，因为目前各个社会主义国家的国内价格是根据本国经济上、政治上各方面的因素规定的，各国的生产技术水平也不尽相同。目前我国同各个兄弟国家贸易上的作价原则：双方交换商品的价格，是参考资本主义国际市场的价格水平，经过双方政府协商决定的。这种经双方商定的商品价格，在一定的有效时期内是不变的、稳定的，避免了资本主义国际市场价格经常波动的影响。
    以我国同苏联贸易上的作价为例，中苏贸易作价原则是一九五○年四月十九日中苏两国政府所签订的第一个贸易协定中规定的。当时议订的双方各种进出口货物的具体作价，是参照当时资本主义国际市场的价格经双方协商确定的（我国对卢布与人民币的内部折算办法，也是按照当时我国人民银行外汇牌价拟定的，这就是我们现在所称的“贸易卢布”）。这一作价原则七年来没有变动，每年只对若干个别的商品价格经双方协议作必要的调整。所以几年来尽管资本主义国际市场商品价格涨落很大，但是中苏间的贸易价格却能一直保持稳定。这对于双方国家进行有计划的经济建设有很大好处。
    我国对苏联出口和从苏联进口的主要商品，如果按照资本主义国际市场的价格，以一九五六年同一九五○年相比，价格变动的情况是这样的：我国对苏联出口商品中，羊毛、大米、桐油、黄麻的价格下跌百分之十到百分之三十，大豆、红茶、生丝、锡、钨砂的价格上涨百分之十到百分之一百六十不等；我国从苏联进口商品中，柴油、汽油的价格变动不大，机械装备、厚钢板、型钢的价格上涨百分之三十到百分之一百四十不等。尤其在一九五一年和一九五二年，资本主义国际市场商品价格的波动很大。但从一九五○年到一九五六年，中苏间交换的商品价格，一直是按一九五○年四月的协议价格计算的，只对某些商品的价格作了必要的调整，因此能够保持稳定。
    当然，如果拿具体一种、两种商品的中苏合同价格同某一时候的资本主义国际市场价格比较，可能有高有低。如大豆，我国对苏联出口价格每公吨三百八十卢布，低于资本主义国际市场价格；如大米，我国对苏联出口价格每公吨五百六十卢布，一九五二、一九五三两年稍为低于资本主义国际市场价格，但是一九五○、一九五一、一九五四、一九五五、一九五六这五年都比资本主义国际市场价格高了许多；如锡，我国对苏联出口价，一九五○年每公吨为六千四百卢布，一九五一年起调整为一万一千六百卢布，一九五六年再调整为八千一百一十六卢布，与历年资本主义国际市场的锡价大致差不多或稍为高些；如我国从苏联进口的厚钢板，资本主义国际市场一九五一年至一九五六年的价格（折合同等品质）：每公吨最高为二百零六点八美元，最低为一百零四点五美元，而我国从苏联进口价格一直是每公吨四百零二卢布，折合一百点五美元。如果把几年来全部进出口商品按资本主义国际市场价格总算起来，中苏贸易价格基本上是公平合理的。而且在我们方面，必须考虑到美国和其他一些资本主义国家对我国实行所谓“禁运”的情形下，如果没有苏联和其他兄弟国家供应我国某些必需进口的物资，那么我们就不能不用很高的代价去向资本主义国家的垄断商人购买，有些商品即使高价求购，也难买到。例如各种优质钢材，苏联尽量满足我国的需要；又如一九五六年我们从资本主义国家进口少量的镍，所付出的价格比从苏联进口的价格高出两倍以上。所以社会主义国家间在贸易价格上，不能单拿一、二项商品计算，必须把几年来全部进出口商品统盘计算，就可以知道是照顾到双方利益的，是公平合理的。总的说来，几年来在中苏贸易价格上，我方并没有吃亏，而是公平合理的。
    有些代表对中苏贸易作价具体情况了解不够，提出若干疑问，这是应该加以解释的。但是右派分子对苏联竭诚帮助我国，故意歪曲；对同中国人民为敌的美国，却多方予以称赞宣扬。这算什么立场？这是值得我们大大警惕的。
    对外贸易的发展方向
    最后，我还要说明一下我国对外贸易关系的发展方向问题。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，我国政府一贯坚持在平等互利的基础上同世界上一切国家发展贸易的方针。几年来，我国同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的贸易关系日益巩固和发展。一九五六年我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易额，占我国对外贸易总额百分之七十五。它一向是我国对外贸易的基本的和主要的部分，也是我国发展对外贸易的巩固可靠的基础。苏联和东欧各兄弟国家给我国设计和装备了数以百计的规模巨大的各种新式工业企业，对我国提供了科学技术上的援助。他们这些帮助，对于我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展起了重大的作用。今后我们仍将继续巩固和发展同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，进一步加强相互之间的经济合作，以促进社会主义各国经济的共同高涨。这是我国发展对外贸易关系的坚定不移的方针。
    近年来，我国同亚非国家的贸易关系也有很大的发展。这些国家主张和平，要求发展独立自主的国民经济，其中有些国家同我国有着传统的贸易往来，恢复这种传统的贸易，是双方都需要的。今后我国将继续根据平等互利的原则，进一步发展同亚非国家的贸易。随着我国和各个亚非国家经济的发展，我们之间发展贸易往来的基础，将会日益广泛和扩大。
    我们对西方国家的贸易，一贯采取了积极的态度。尽管美国政府对我国实行所谓“禁运”，并且强制别的国家对我国采取贸易歧视政策，但是我国同许多西方国家的贸易仍然逐年有所发展，只是由于有些西方国家追随美国执行“禁运”政策，使得贸易关系不能正常化。最近英国及丹麦、挪威、荷兰、法国、比利时、西德、意大利、葡萄牙、庐森堡等西方国家放宽对我国的“禁运”，这对发展国际正常贸易是一个积极的步骤。但是，这些国家并没有完全放弃对我国的贸易歧视政策，仍然保持着二百多种所谓“禁运”的主要项目。如新式工业设备、大型和精密的机器、精密轴承、精密仪器、某些通讯设备、快速船舶、浮船坞、石油产品、铜锭、某些合金、某些电气材料、某些化学工业产品等，仍然列在“禁运”单内。这些“禁运”项目如不取消，对发展正常贸易无疑地仍然是很大的障碍。例如卖给汽车而不卖汽油，卖给柴油机而不卖柴油，必然会使贸易发展受到很大的限制。同时，从进行贸易的条件来看，我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家间的贸易，是真正建立在平等互利的基础上的，双方采取易货的办法，进出口能够保持平衡，在运输、结算、支付等方面都有很多互相便利的共同条件，遇有问题，经过友好协商，都能得到合理的解决。目前我国同西方国家的贸易还缺乏这样便利的条件。此外，由于“禁运”的阻挠，几年来我国同某些西方国家的贸易往来受到了很多限制，要了解和熟悉它们的生产情况、产品的技术、性能和供应可能，也还需要一些时间。不过，即使如此，我们相信，如果西方国家能够切实采取有利于发展贸易的积极措施，我国同某些西方国家的贸易还是有发展前途的。
    各位代表，希望你们对于对外贸易部门的工作经常给予检查、协助、批评和指教！
