    Long Live the Chinese Communist Party
    Ma Xulun
    For the people of the whole country, without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without the Communist Party, the Chinese people could not have overthrown the three great enemies and completed the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution; without the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people would not have had the victory of the five major movements, the victory of the three major transformations, and the great victory of economic construction and cultural construction in the past eight years, which were more miraculous year after year. The reason why the Chinese people have such confidence and courage to carry out the great cause unprecedented in history is because we have a strong, wise, and correct leading core—the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, the entire Chinese people love the Communist Party as they cherish their own eyes. A few right-wing ambitious elements, like mayflies trying to shake a big tree, want to use the Party's rectification movement to shake the Party's leadership, no wonder they will be met with the angry counterattack of the people of the whole country.
    On the Party's birthday today, I would like to, in the capacity of the person in charge of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, express my firm support for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the socialist cause of the Chinese people.
    The leadership of the Party and socialism are the basis for our democratic parties to coexist with the Communist Party for a long time and supervise each other. The rampant attack of right-wing ambitious elements is not only a challenge to the Party and the people of the whole country, but also a challenge to our democratic parties. We must resolutely criticize and struggle against the right-wing ambitious elements, strictly draw a line between ourselves and right-wing ideology, so that every member can temper themselves in the struggle, distinguish right from wrong, and correct their stand.

    中国共产党万岁
    马叙伦
    对全国人民来说，没有共产党，就没有新中国，没有共产党，中国人民打倒不了三大敌人，完成不了反帝反封建的民主革命，没有中国共产党，中国人民不会有五大运动的胜利，不会有三大改造的胜利，不会有八年来一年比一年奇迹似的经济建设、文化建设的伟大胜利。中国人民之所以有这样的信心和勇气进行着前人所未有的伟大事业，就是因为我们有着坚强的，英明的正确的领导核心——中国共产党。因此，全中国人民热爱共产党，像爱护自己的眼珠一样。少数右派野心分子们像蜉蝣撼大树，要想利用党的整风运动动摇党的领导，无怪乎要受到全国人民的愤怒的反击。
    在党的生日的今天，我愿意以中国民主促进会负责人的身份，对中国共产党在中国人民社会主义事业中的领导表示坚决的拥护。
    党的领导和社会主义是我们民主党派同共产党长期共存，互相监督的基础。右派野心分子的猖狂进攻，不但是对党对全国人民挑战，也是对我们民主党派的挑战。我们一定要坚决对右派野心分子进行批判和斗争，同右派思想严格划清界限，使每一成员在斗争中锻炼自己，明辨是非，端正立场。
