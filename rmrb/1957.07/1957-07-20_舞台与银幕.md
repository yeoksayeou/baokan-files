Stage and Screen

    Distant Guests on the Beijing Stage
    The Jilin City Drama Troupe, after touring major cities and industrial and mining areas in Northeast China, has now arrived in Beijing to perform for the capital's audiences.
    The Jilin City Drama Troupe was formerly the Forward Drama Troupe, formed in Tianjin in 1952. This time, they have brought the five-act, nine-scene historical drama "Song of Righteousness" (Wen Tianxiang) and "Fate in Tears and Laughter," adapted from Zhang Henshui's novel of the same name. "Song of Righteousness" was written by playwright Wu Zuguang in Chongqing during the War of Resistance Against Japan and greatly aroused the people's patriotic enthusiasm. The troupe's performance allows the audience to see the heroic image of this historically famous figure, Wen Tianxiang, who was loyal and unyielding, and is a good patriotic education. (Lan)

    "Butterfly Cup" on the Silver Screen
    The stage art film "Butterfly Cup" is based on Hebei Bangzi Opera. "Butterfly Cup" is a popular play in Bangzi Opera, and the "Hiding the Boat" and "Presenting the Cup" scenes have long been popular highlights. When dealing with this play, the film director remained very faithful to the original stage performance techniques, so that the essence of the play and the superb singing on the stage are relatively completely preserved in the film. Li Guiyun, a famous Hebei Bangzi Opera actress, plays the heroine Hu Fenglian in the film. Li Guiyun's singing is melodious and expressive; her acting is also very delicate and well-organized. Her portrayal of Hu Fenglian, the brave and wise fisherwoman, is very moving. (Fang)

    Watching the Circus at Taoranting Park
    The capital's audience is in for a treat, as they can watch the wonderful performances of the Qiqihar Circus every night these days at Taoranting Park. The horses in the circus are truly “human”; when a red silk is tied to their hooves, they can untie it with their mouths; when hidden in a box, they can open the lid with their mouths and take out the red silk to return it to their master. After the monkeys ride a dog-pulled cart around the field, Mr. Bear comes out to perform. Among the beasts, none is dumber than the bear, but its clumsiness is humorous and laughable. The bear performed "handstand," "somersault," "wearing a frame," "ringing a bell," and lying on the ground to "stir a stick," and standing on the table to "play with a gun." It was truly a complete set of clumsy and funny behavior, making people laugh until their stomachs hurt. "Splitting the Saber on Horseback" is one of the most popular programs. Amidst the sound of war drums, a fierce general wearing helmet and armor, holding a large saber, and with a face like jujube, leaped onto the horse and danced the saber. The horse ran like flying, as if galloping on the battlefield. "Stepping on a Big Rope" is a traditional program in ancient Chinese circus that this circus troupe has excavated, reorganized, and creatively developed on the original basis. In particular, "head-to-head acrobatics" is a program not yet seen at home and abroad. If you didn't see it with your own eyes, it would be hard to believe. The "springboard" personally taught by the famous old artist Sun Jitang is performed collectively by more than a dozen young male and female actors. From beginning to end, the audience feels nervous, excited, and happy. Zhao Fengqi's "clown performance" satirizes crude and perfunctory formalism to the fullest extent. The "water meteor" performed by this circus troupe has four major characteristics: long rope, large bowl, "flip" fast, and many exquisite patterns, which are admired by acrobats who perform the same program.

    舞台与银幕
    北京舞台上的远客
    在东北各大城市和工矿区做了旅行公演的吉林市话剧团，现在已经来到北京为首都的观众演出了。
    吉林市话剧团的前身，是1952年在天津组成的前进话剧团。这一次，他们带来了五幕九场的历史剧“正气歌”（文天祥），和根据张恨水原著同名小说改编的“啼笑因缘”两个剧目。“正气歌”是剧作家吴祖光抗战期间在重庆写成的，当时曾大大地激起了人民抗日爱国的热情。该团这次的演出，使观众能够看到我国这个万古留名的历史人物忠贞不屈的英雄形象，是一次很好的爱国主义教育。  （兰）
    “蝴蝶杯”上银幕
    舞台艺术片“蝴蝶杯”是根据河北梆子戏拍摄的。“蝴蝶杯”是梆子戏里历演不衰的好戏，其中的“藏舟”、“献杯”等几折戏更是长久以来脍炙人口的精品。电影导演在处理这个戏的时候，非常忠实于舞台上原有的表现手法，使得这出戏前本中的精萃及舞台上的精湛演唱都得以较完整地保留在影片之中。片中饰演女主角胡凤莲的是河北梆子名演员李桂云。李桂云的唱腔婉转动听，极富表现力；做功也非常细腻有致。她所塑造的胡凤莲这个勇敢智慧的渔家女的形象是很动人的。  （方）
    陶然亭看马戏
    首都观众有好眼福，这几天每晚可以到陶然亭公园观赏齐齐哈尔马戏团的精采表演。马戏团里的马真是通“人性”，一块红绸系到蹄上，它能用嘴解下；藏到箱里，它能用嘴启开箱盖，将红绸取出送还主人。猴子坐着狗拉车绕场一周之后，熊先生出场表演。兽类中最笨莫如大熊了，但它笨得幽默、惹人发笑。大熊表演了“拿顶”、“栽跟头”、“戴架”、“摇铃”和躺在地下“拨棍”、站在桌上“耍枪”，真是丑态百出，使人笑破肚皮。“马上劈刀”是最受欢迎的节目之一。战鼓声中，一位戴盔披甲，手持大刀、面如重枣的猛将，跃马上场，舞动大刀，马走如飞，犹如驰骋战场之上。“踩大绳”是这个马戏团挖掘、整理、并在原有基础上经过创造、发展了的中国古代马戏中的传统节目，特别是“对头顶人”是国内外尚未见到的节目。如不是亲眼看到，简直难以相信。著名老艺人孙吉堂亲自传授的“跳板”，由十余名青年男女演员集体表演。自始至终使观众感到紧张而又兴奋、愉快。赵凤岐表演的“滑稽表演”，把粗枝大叶形式主义讽刺得淋漓尽致。这个马戏团表演的“水流星”有四大特点：绳长、碗大、“翻”急、花样多而精，是演同一节目的杂技演员都佩服的。（光）
