    Rare White Bears
    Two white bears, rarely found in China, have recently been captured in the high mountain area of Fang County, Hubei Province. These two white bears are similar to polar bears. The larger bear is over two years old and weighs over 130 jin (65 kg), while the smaller bear is only four or five months old and weighs over 30 jin (15 kg). Zoologists preliminarily believe that these two white bears may be variants of brown bears or black bears produced in China, which is extremely rare in our country.
    These two white bears have been on display at the Wuhan Zhongshan Park Zoo since June 30.

    罕见的白熊
    湖北省房县高山地区最近捕捉到二只我国极少发现过的白熊。这二只白熊类似北极熊，大熊已二岁多，重达一百三十余斤，小熊才四五个月，重三十余斤。动物学家们初步认为这二只白熊可能是我国所产的棕熊或黑熊的变种，这在我国也是极其罕见的。
    这二只白熊自6月30日起已在武汉市中山公园动物园展出。
