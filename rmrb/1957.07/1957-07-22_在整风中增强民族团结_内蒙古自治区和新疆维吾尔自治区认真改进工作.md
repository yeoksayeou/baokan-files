According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: A special team composed of leading cadres from the Party and government organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Hohhot Municipal People's Committee has compiled and sorted out more than 370 relatively important opinions raised by various parties since the beginning of the rectification campaign and dealt with them. Some of the problems that can be solved at present have been resolved, or solutions have been proposed; for problems that are temporarily difficult to solve, it has also been decided to solve them gradually.

In accordance with suggestions from various parties to cultivate a large number of ethnic minority workers to meet the further development of the autonomous region's construction, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Committee decided this year to recruit 430 Mongolian and other ethnic minority students from middle school graduates and send them to central and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region secondary vocational schools for training. Regarding the issue of Mongolian children's enrollment and the establishment of Mongolian primary schools requested by the Mongolian masses, according to the number of Mongolian children enrolling this year, the Education Department and the Hohhot Municipal People's Committee jointly decided that, starting this autumn, the Second Normal School Affiliated Elementary School will be converted into a Mongolian primary school, and all the original Han students will be transferred to a newly built primary school. Regarding the issue of Hui cadres requesting solutions to Hui children's enrollment in kindergartens, the Hohhot Municipal People's Committee has allocated funds to establish a Hui kindergarten in the Hui district. According to the requirements of the Mongolian masses, relevant parties are preparing to build a Mongolian People's Food Department in an appropriate location to meet the needs of the Mongolian people.

In order to implement the policy of using both Mongolian and Han languages in official documents, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee has instructed the autonomous region-level leading organs and mass organizations to further inspect and improve this work. A Mongolian Secretariat will be established to specialize in the research and promotion of Mongolian secretarial and administrative work. All kinds of documents issued by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee to the League Party Committees are now issued in both Mongolian and Han languages. The radio station will also add Mongolian conversation and Mongolian record programs in the near future, according to suggestions from the masses.

Problems in the autonomous region's culture and education sectors are also being properly resolved according to the opinions of the masses. For example, the Political School officially opened on June 20 after the problems of lacking housing were resolved; other problems in terms of cadres, teaching materials, and books are also being continuously resolved with the help of various parties. Regarding the problem of the internship base for the Health School, the Health Department has convened a meeting of the Health School, the Inner Mongolia Hospital, the Inner Mongolia Maternity Hospital, and the Hohhot Municipal People's Hospital to study and clarify the relationship between the school's internship and the three hospitals, and to solve the specific problems in teaching internship. Regarding the issue of dividing the medical responsibility areas of the Inner Mongolia Hospital, the Inner Mongolia Maternity Hospital, the Hohhot Municipal Hospital, and the joint clinics, the Health Department and the Hohhot Municipal Health Bureau are studying specific measures. The problem of insufficient manpower to sort out the backlog of books in the Inner Mongolia Library has been solved by allocating funds from the Inner Mongolia Culture Bureau to hire people.

In addition, the Hohhot Municipal People's Committee has decided to strive to build or repair the artificial lake southern embankment of the People's Park and reinforce the base of the library this year or next year, according to suggestions.

Regarding the work of using cars and improving canteen management in the autonomous region-level organs, relevant units are studying improvements based on the opinions raised by the masses. Regarding opinions on the use of housing, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, and the Hohhot Municipal People's Committee will conduct in-depth investigations and studies and prepare to make necessary adjustments.

Urumqi dispatch of this newspaper on the 19th: Many organs, organizations, and schools in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are seriously handling the criticisms and suggestions raised by the masses in the rectification movement.

The CPC Urumqi Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee have conducted investigations and studies on the issues raised by the masses regarding the continuous drowning deaths in the Peace Canal and the pollution of drinking water in the Mohe Canal, and have dealt with them separately. On the Peace Canal, unnecessary single-plank bridges were dismantled, and the wooden bridges on the sidewalks were widened and equipped with handrails. Many rescue appliances have also been added in areas along the Peace Canal where many citizens reside, and there are dedicated personnel on duty patrolling in shifts every day. The masses are very satisfied with these measures. In order to completely solve the problem of drinking water pollution in the Mohe Canal, the Municipal People's Committee has decided to install tile pipes from Nanliang to Nanmen in the Mohe Canal, and the tile pipes are equipped with water pumps for water extraction. This work is being handled by the Municipal Health Bureau.

Many units have begun to correct the phenomenon of inappropriate work arrangements and lack of power for some ethnic minority cadres. The ethnic minority cadres in the various departments of the Autonomous Region Health Department were not only few in the past, but also few who engaged in business work. Recently, the six newly added ethnic minority cadres have been assigned to do business work. At the same time, the work areas of certain ethnic minority cadres have also been appropriately adjusted, and gradually ethnic cadres are being sent to work in their own ethnic regions. The Autonomous Region Department of Agriculture particularly emphasized the need to respect the powers of ethnic minority cadres and made a decision that Han cadres in each department, regardless of the size of the matter, must consult and study with ethnic minority cadres and strictly prevent monopolization and substitution. In addition, it is stipulated that all printed documents must be in both Uygur and Han languages, and interpreters must be provided at meetings.

The Autonomous Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles has also decided to establish Xinjiang branches of the Artists, Dramatists, Dancers, and Musicians Associations according to the requirements of the masses. Currently, the preparatory committee has been established.

Many units are also prepared to explain and clarify to the masses opinions and requirements that cannot be fulfilled for the time being or are too high due to insufficient understanding of the actual situation. Some problems that involve a wide range but must be solved are being seized upon to be carried out. For example, the leadership issue of the August 1st Agricultural College and the issue of merging certain departments with other colleges are currently being referred to the central government for handling.

    在整风中增强民族团结
    内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区认真改进工作
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报消息：内蒙古自治区党政领导机关和呼和浩特市人民委员会一部分负责干部共同组成的专门小组，已经把自整风开始以来各方面提出的比较重要的意见，汇集整理为三百七十多条，加以处理。对目前能够解决的一部分问题，已进行解决，或者提出了解决办法；对暂时不易解决的问题，也决定逐步解决。
    根据各方面要求大量培养民族职工，以适应自治区建设的进一步发展的建议，内蒙古党委和自治区人民委员会今年决定从中学毕业生中招收四百三十名蒙古族和区内少数民族学生，分别送中央和内蒙古自治区各中等专业学校培养。关于蒙古族群众要求解决蒙古族儿童入学和设立蒙古小学的问题，根据今年蒙古儿童入学数目，教育厅和呼和浩特市人民委员会共同研究决定，从今年秋季开始将第二师范附小改为蒙古小学，原来的汉族学生全部转入新建的小学。关于回族干部要求解决回族儿童入幼儿园的问题，呼和浩特市人民委员会已拨款在回民区建立一所回民幼儿园。根据蒙古族群众的要求，有关方面准备在适当地点筹建蒙古族人民食品部，以满足蒙古族人民的需要。
    为了贯彻执行用蒙汉两种文字行文的方针，内蒙古党委已指示自治区一级领导机关和群众团体，进一步检查改进这一工作。设立蒙文秘书处，专门研究和推行蒙文秘书行政工作。内蒙古党委现在发至旗委的各种文件，已全部用蒙汉两种文字并行。广播电台也根据群众建议，近日即将增加蒙语会话和蒙语唱片的节目。
    自治区内文教方面的问题，也根据群众的意见进行妥善的解决。例如政治学校在缺少房屋等问题解决后，已于6月20日正式开学；其他在干部、教材和图书方面的问题，也在各方面继续帮助解决中。关于卫生学校的实习基地问题，卫生厅已召集卫生学校、内蒙古医院、内蒙古产院、呼和浩特市人民医院开会研究，明确了学校实习与三个医院的关系，解决了教学实习当中的具体问题。关于划分内蒙古医院、内蒙古产院、呼和浩特市医院和联合诊所的医疗责任区问题，卫生厅和呼和浩特市卫生局正在研究具体办法。内蒙古图书馆整理积压图书力量不够的问题，已由内蒙古文化局拨款雇人解决。
    此外，对修筑人民公园人工湖南面水堤，加固图书馆基地的建议，呼和浩特市人民委员会已决定在今年或明年内争取修筑。
    关于自治区一级机关使用汽车和改善食堂管理的工作，根据群众提出的意见，有关单位正研究改进中。对于房舍使用上的意见，将由内蒙古自治区人民委员会、内蒙古党委、呼和浩特市人民委员会深入调查研究，准备进行必要的调整。
    本报乌鲁木齐19日电　新疆维吾尔自治区很多机关团体和学校，正认真地处理群众在整风运动中提出的批评和建议。
    中共乌鲁木齐市委和市人民委员会，对群众所提出的关于和平渠连续淹死人和磨河渠饮水被染污的问题，作了调查研究，并分别进行了处理。在和平渠上，一面拆除了不必要的独木桥，一面加宽了人行道上的木桥，并安上了扶栏。沿和平渠两岸市民居住较多的地方，还添设了许多救护器具，每天都有专人轮流巡逻。群众对这些措施非常满意。为了彻底解决磨河渠饮水被染污的问题，市人民委员会已决定从南梁到南门的磨河渠安装瓦管，瓦管上并设有抽水机，以便取水。这项工作正由市卫生局办理。
    很多单位对一部分民族干部的工作安排不当和有职无权的现象，已经开始着手纠正。自治区卫生厅各科室的民族干部，过去不但少，而且搞业务工作的也不多。最近把新增加的六名民族干部，都分配做业务工作。同时又把某些民族干部的工作地区，也作了适当的调整，逐步使本民族的干部到本民族地区去工作。自治区农业厅特别强调要尊重民族干部的职权，并作出了决定，各科室的汉族干部，不管事大事小都要和民族干部共同商量研究，严防包办代替。此外，还规定印发的文件一律要用维、汉两种文字，开会时必须配备翻译。
    自治区文学艺术联合会也根据群众的要求，决定成立美术家、戏剧家、舞蹈家和音乐家协会新疆分会，目前筹备委员会已成立。
    很多单位还对一时不能办到或由于对实际情况不够了解而要求过高的意见和要求，都准备向群众进行交代和解释。有些牵涉的面虽广但又必须解决的问题，正抓紧时间进行。如八一农学院的领导问题以及某些学系要和其他院校合并的问题，现正请示中央处理。
