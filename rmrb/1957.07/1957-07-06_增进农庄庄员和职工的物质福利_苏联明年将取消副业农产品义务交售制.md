    To Increase the Material Welfare of Farm Members and Employees
    The Soviet Union Will Abolish the Obligatory Sales System for Sideline Agricultural Products Next Year
    Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: TASS reports that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers decided on July 4th that, starting from January 1st, 1958, the system of obligatory sales of agricultural products from sideline occupations by collective farm members, members of various cooperatives, workers, and employees will be abolished.
    The resolution states that, due to the development of collective farms and state farms' production, and the resulting increase in the amount of agricultural product procurement, the purchase quotas for collective farm members, workers, and employees' sideline production were greatly reduced in 1953. The resolution points out that it is now possible to completely abolish the various agricultural products that must be obligatorily sold to the state from these sideline productions. This will undoubtedly increase the material welfare of Soviet collective farm members, workers, and employees.
    The resolution points out that as a result of the continuous growth of agricultural production in the Soviet Union, the national grain procurement volume in 1956 increased by 1.4 billion poods compared to 1953.
    The resolution says that the socialist sector now plays a decisive role in supplying agricultural products to the Soviet residents. Now, only collective farms and state farms sell grain, beets, cotton, flax, hemp, oil crops, and vegetables to the state. Most collective farms have now become wealthy, economically strong, and farms with diverse production capabilities.

    增进农庄庄员和职工的物质福利
    苏联明年将取消副业农产品义务交售制
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联共产党中央委员会和部长会议7月4日决定，自1958年1月1日起，取消集体农庄庄员、各种合作社社员、工人和职员在从事副业方面的农产品义务交售制。
    决议说，由于集体农庄和国营农场生产的发展以及由此而来的农产品收购数量的增加，1953年对集体农庄庄员、工人和职员的副业生产的征购定额大大降低了。决议指出，现在有可能完全取消这些副业生产应向国家义务交售的各种农产品。这无疑地会增进苏联的集体农庄庄员、工人和职员的物质福利。
    决议指出，由于苏联农产品的产量不断增长的结果，1956年全国谷物征购量比1953年增加了十四亿普特。
    决议说，在对苏联居民供应农产品方面，社会主义部分现在起着决定性作用。现在只是由集体农庄和国营农场向国家交售谷物、甜菜、棉花、亚麻、大麻、含油作物和蔬菜。大多数集体农庄现在已经变成富裕的、在经济上强大的和具有多方面生产能力的农庄了。
