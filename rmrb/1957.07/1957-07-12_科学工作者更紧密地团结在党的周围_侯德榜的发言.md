I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's reports on the state budget and final accounts, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan, and the work reports of Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. From the above reports, I learned that our country has made great achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction, and I am very excited.

In recent years, our country has built many new enterprises, many new industrial cities have emerged, and many old cities have also been greatly developed. Our country is marching towards industrialization; the people's living standards are also gradually improving. 1957 is the last year of the first Five-Year Plan, and the total industrial output value has exceeded 60 billion yuan, of which the production of means of production has exceeded 31 billion yuan. The output of the vast majority of products will increase by about 10 percent in 1957 compared to 1956. This shows that our country's economic construction has indeed made great achievements, so it can maintain such a rapid rate of growth.

Politically, we have achieved the victories of the five major movements of land reform, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, eliminating counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, and ideological remolding, and have achieved brilliant results in the three major transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Those who cannot see these achievements are either stubbornly ignorant or maliciously distorting the truth.

Now our country is advancing under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We will fundamentally solve the people's problems of food and clothing. We need to increase the area of arable land to increase the production of grain and cotton. However, we have a large population and limited resources. Large-scale reclamation is limited, the cost is high, and attention must be paid to soil erosion. Therefore, in addition to reclamation, we should also increase the yield per unit area. Increasing the yield per unit area requires chemical fertilizers. In the second Five-Year Plan, the production of chemical fertilizers has been increased from the original annual output of 3.2 million tons to an annual output of 5 million tons, and it is feared that it will have to be increased even more in the end. This is completely correct, because it will further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

On the other hand, to solve the problem of clothing without affecting grain production, it is necessary to develop the man-made fiber industry to supplement the shortage of cotton, such as nylon, capron, elande, rayon, vinylon, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride, terylene, etc. These man-made fibers are light and durable. One foot of man-made fiber can at least抵五尺棉布用. After solving the people's food and clothing problems, we can concentrate our efforts on solving other problems and ensure the realization of a beautiful life in socialist society.

I have been engaged in the chemical industry all my life. From the above-mentioned solutions to the problems of food and clothing, I deeply feel the correctness of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. I am also a scientific worker, and I deeply realize that the leadership of the Party is indispensable for marching towards science, but the right-wing elements absurdly say that the Party cannot lead scientific research. I know that the Party is fully capable of leading scientific research. Just look at our country's achievements in scientific research, the popularization of knowledge, the improvement of technology, and the achievements in construction in recent years, are they not the result of the Party leading the people of the whole country to struggle against nature? Without the leadership of the Party, our scientific community would be like a rudderless ship, and it would be impossible to achieve such great achievements in science and economic construction. To cite an example: Although the two organizations, "National Association for Science and Technology" and "Popular Science," have achieved certain results in their work in the past seven years, they are far behind the requirements of the development of the situation. Academic activities have not been carried out in a variety of ways; organizational leadership is not sound enough; and the guiding principles and tasks are not clear enough. Recently, with the support and guidance of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the leadership and assistance of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, our "National Association for Science and Technology's" past wavering guiding principles and tasks have been clarified. Everyone is very happy. After the "National Association for Science and Technology" has the leadership and support of the Party, the work will be launched and enter a new stage, and it can unite the broad masses of scientists and connect the scientific workers of the whole country to advance by leaps and bounds. Our scientific community demands the leadership of the Party, and the stronger this leadership, the greater the achievements.

Under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work, the right-wing elements took the opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Party, slander it as a "Party-dominated world," and vainly attempt to have the Party withdraw from its leading position and "return power to the people." They do not know that the Party is the Party of the people, for the broad masses of the people, and is the vanguard of the proletariat. This Party is selflessly leading the people of the whole country to advance towards socialism. This provision, with the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, is enshrined in the Constitution. Right-wing elements, your behavior is contrary to the Constitution and cannot be tolerated by the people of the whole country! Repent quickly.

The right-wing elements attempted to obliterate all the achievements of the Party and slander the Party. I can tell them: it is this Party that, from 1949 to the present, has completed and overfulfilled the three-year economic recovery and the first Five-Year National Economic Construction Plan, changing the face of the motherland; it is this Party that, in just a few years, has reversed the phenomenon of insufficient food and clothing and turned it into a situation where there is basically enough cotton and a surplus of grain to support Asian and African countries; it is this Party that can turn a backward agricultural country into a country with heavy industry, capable of manufacturing its own cars, trucks, boilers, generators, tractors, jet aircraft, heavy machinery, steel, and oil; it is this Party that can make the despised "sick man of East Asia" suddenly appear in the world as a great power, shaking the imperialist ambitions and making them afraid to invade arbitrarily again. Those who distort such brilliant achievements and slander the leadership of the Party are ambitious careerists with ulterior motives and are cutting themselves off from the people.

Recently, I went abroad and passed through Myanmar, India, and Colombo, Ceylon. When I returned and arrived in Kunming, the "city of eternal spring," in contrast, I felt that the climate and environment of the motherland were really lovely. Every inch of land in our country, from the northeast to the southwest, is lovely. It is not too cold when it is cold; it is not too hot when it is hot. I feel that the motherland is really too lovely! When head of delegation Guo Moruo arrived at Kunming Airport, he told me: "If there are still people who do not love the country today, they will know how to love the country after going abroad once." Indeed, many comrades who have gone abroad have this feeling. Do many of the right-wing elements who have also gone abroad have this feeling? Know that to love the country, you must love the Party; to love the Party is to love the country; without the Communist Party, there would be no new China? Accepting the leadership of the Party means serving the people wholeheartedly, which means serving beautiful socialism.

The absurd and preposterous remarks of the right-wing elements cannot withstand the refutation of the people. Their attempt to restore the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and revive feudalism will not succeed. The Party suffered a frenzied attack from the bourgeoisie in the past Three-Anti and Five-Anti struggles, and the Party defeated them and achieved great victories. The Party suffered a frenzied attack from the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in the ideological remolding and suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, and the Party also defeated them and achieved great victories. Today, the Party is suffering a frenzied attack from the right-wing elements in the rectification movement, attempting to usurp the leadership. I firmly believe that this time the Party will certainly be able to achieve a comprehensive victory. We, the scientific workers of the whole country, should unite more closely around the Party, strengthen unity, help the Party do a good job in the rectification movement, and repel the frenzied attack of the right-wing elements.

Finally, we guarantee to follow Chairman Mao's instructions in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the Eleventh Supreme State Conference on February 27, starting from unity, resolutely fight against them, and not withdraw until their bourgeois rightist thinking is completely eliminated. Therefore, our request is: these rightist elements must thoroughly and completely confess, bow their heads to the Party and the people, make profound self-criticisms, and honestly admit their guilt!

Fellow representatives! As a scientific worker, I deeply realize that we should support the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," so as to distinguish right from wrong and eliminate fallacies that distort the facts. This is the only position for scientific workers to uphold justice; as a National People's Congress representative, I hope that each of our representatives will take responsibility for this evil trend.

    科学工作者更紧密地团结在党的周围
    侯德榜的发言
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李先念副总理的国家预算和决算报告，薄一波副总理的国民经济计划报告，张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长及彭真副委员长的工作报告。我从上面各项报告中，知道我国在政治建设、经济建设和文化建设中，都取得巨大的成就，感到非常兴奋。
    近几年来，我们国家已建设了许多新企业，有许多新工业城市出现了，有许多旧城市也大大发展了。我们国家正向工业化的道路上迈步前进；人民的生活也逐步地得到改善。1957年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，工业总产值已超过六百亿元，其中生产资料的生产超过三百一十亿元。绝大多数产品的产量，1957年比1956年要增加百分之十左右。这说明我们国家的经济建设确有很大的成就，所以才能够保持这样快的增长速度前进。
    在政治上，我们取得了土地改革、抗美援朝、肃清反革命、三反五反和思想改造五大运动的胜利，获得了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业三大改造的辉煌成绩。看不到这些成绩的人，不是冥顽无知，便是心怀恶意有意歪曲的人。
    现在我们国家正在中国共产党和毛主席领导下前进。我们将从根本上解决人民的食与穿的问题。我们需要增加耕地面积来增产粮食与棉花。但是我们人口众多，资源有限，大规模开垦是有限制的，费用也是大的，而且还要注意到水土流失问题。因此，除了开垦外，还应当增加单位面积产量。增加单位面积产量，就需要化学肥料。在第二个五年计划中，化学肥料的生产已由原来的年产三百二十万吨提高到年产五百万吨，最终恐将还要多多提高才是。这是完全正确的，因为这样就能够更加巩固工农联盟。
    另一方面，要解决穿的问题而又不影响粮食的生产，就需要发展人造纤维的工业，补充棉花的不足，如耐隆、卡普隆、爱兰德、丽绚、维尼隆、聚丙烯氰、聚氯乙烯、忒尔里林等等。这些人造纤维的质量轻而耐穿，一尺人造纤维至少可抵五尺棉布用。解决了人民的衣食问题后，就可以集中力量解决其他，保证实现社会主义社会的美好生活。
    我是毕生从事于化学工业的人。从上面所述解决食、穿问题上，我深深感到党与毛主席的领导的正确。我也是一个科学工作者，深深体会到要向科学进军，党的领导是不可缺少的，而右派分子却妄说党不能领导科学研究。我知道党是完全能够领导科学研究的。试看我国几年来科学研究的成就、知识的普及、技术的提高、建设的成就，不就是党领导全国人民向自然界斗争的结果吗？如果没有党的领导，我们科学界就像没有舵的船一样，不可能在科学及经济建设方面取得这样大的成就的。试举一个例子：“全国科联”与“科普”这两个组织，七年来工作虽有一定的成绩，但远远落后于形势发展的要求。学术活动没有多种多样的展开；组织领导不够健全；方针任务不够明确。最近争取到中共中央宣传部的支持与指示和国务院科学规划委员会的领导与协助，使我们“全国科联”过去摇摆不定的方针任务，都明确起来。大家皆大欢喜。“全国科联”自有党的领导与支持后，工作就展开，就进入了一个新的阶段，就可以团结广大的科学家，联系全国科学工作者大踏步地前进。我们科学界要求党领导，这领导愈强，成就也愈大。
    右派分子借口帮助党整风为名，乘机猖狂向党进攻，反对社会主义，反对党的领导，诬蔑为“党天下”，妄想党退出领导地位，“还政于民”。不知党就是人民的党，就是为了广大人民，就是无产阶级的先锋队。这个党是大公无私地领导全国人民向社会主义前进的。这以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的规定，是载在宪法的。右派分子，你们这个行为是违背宪法的，是为全国人民所不能容许的！其速回头反省。
    右派分子企图抹煞党的一切成就，诬蔑党。我可以告诉他们：就是这个党，它从一九四九年起，八年至今，完成和超额完成三年经济恢复，和第一个五年国家经济建设计划，改变了祖国的面貌；就是这个党，它在短短几年中，扭转了粮食不够吃、棉花不够穿的现象，变为棉花基本上够，粮食还有余可以支援亚非国家的情况，就是这个党，它能够使一个落后的农业国变为有重工业、能够自制汽车、卡车、锅炉、发电机、拖拉机、喷气飞机、重型机械，有钢铁、有石油的国家；就是这个党，它能够使被人瞧不起的“东亚病夫”，一旦以大国出现于世界，震撼了帝国主义野心家，使它们不敢再肆意侵略。歪曲这样光辉的成就，诬蔑党的领导的人，就是别有用心的野心家，就是自绝于人民的。
    最近我出国，经过缅甸、印度到锡兰的科伦坡。回来时到达“四季皆春”的昆明，相形之下，我感觉到祖国气候和环境真是可爱啊。我国土地从东北到西南寸寸都是可爱的。冷的不是过冷；热的不是过热。我感觉到祖国实在太可爱啊！郭沫若团长到昆明飞机场时告我：“如果今日尚有不爱国的人，到国外去一趟，回来就晓得爱国了。”诚然，很多出国的同志，都有这样的感觉。右派分子中也有许多出过国的，是否有此感觉呢？要知道爱国必须爱党，爱党就是爱国；没有共产党，那有新中国？接受党的领导，就是全心全意为人民服务，就是为美好的社会主义服务。
    右派分子的荒谬绝伦的言论，经不住人民的驳斥。他们要资产阶级专政复辟，要封建主义复活，是不能得逞的。党在过去三反、五反斗争中曾遭受资产阶级的猖狂进攻，党击溃了它们，取得了很大的胜利。党在思想改造、镇压反革命运动当中，曾受过胡风反革命集团猖狂进攻，党也击溃了它们，取得了伟大的胜利。今天党在整风当中，遭受到右派分子的猖狂进攻，企图篡夺领导权。我深深相信这次党也一定能够取得全面的胜利。我们全国科学工作者，应当更密切地围绕在党的周围，加强团结，帮助党做好整风工作，击退右派分子猖狂进攻。
    最后，我们保证遵循毛主席二月二十七日在十一次最高国务会议上“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，从团结出发，坚决和他们作斗争，不达到彻底消除他们的资产阶级右倾思想不收兵。因此，我们的要求是：这些右倾分子彻头彻尾交代清楚，向党和人民低头，深刻地检讨，老老实实地认罪！
    各位代表！作为一个科学工作者，我深深体会我们应拥护“百家争鸣”的方针，因而明辨是非，辟除歪曲事实的谬论，这是科学工作者扶持正义的唯一立场；作为一个全国人民代表，我希望我们代表个个对这歪风邪气一齐负起责任。
