    In the anti-Rightist struggle, people of all ethnic groups in the directly subordinate organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region thoroughly exposed Rong Xiang, who had always disguised himself as a defender of the interests of the Mongolian people, as an anti-Communist and anti-People element.

    Rong Xiang is currently the Deputy Mayor of Hohhot, concurrently the Director of the Museum of Literature and History, Vice Chairman of the Hohhot Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, a member of the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, and a representative of the Inner Mongolia and Hohhot People's Congresses, holding other important positions. After this rectification campaign began, he immediately launched a vicious attack on the Party, slandering that "Communists have two sources—subjectivism and bureaucracy; and one component—sectarianism." "What the Communist Party loves are those who flatter and toady, what they listen to are words of praise, they can't stand to see those who stand upright, and they can't bear to hear any bad words." He even said: "It's not as good as the Qing Dynasty now!" He distorted history, provoking discord by saying: "In the Qing Dynasty, the Mongolian and Han people lived in peace, but now, they are fighting each other to the death!" He shamelessly posed as the "sage" (referring to India's Gandhi) of the Tumed Banner (west of Hohhot). The unreasonable phenomenon of the coexistence of banner and county existed in the Tumed Banner. After liberation, the Party and the government, in order to strengthen national unity, resolved it reasonably according to the wishes of the majority of Mongolian and Han people there. But Rong Xiang took the opportunity to attack, saying: "What the Kuomintang could not do, the Communist Party has done." He incited the Mongolian people of the former Tumed Banner who were incorporated into Hohhot, saying, "You have found a stepmother, and no one will speak for you. In the future, if you have grievances, you will have nowhere to appeal, and you will have to come to this old man." implying that only he was the true mother of the Mongolian people of the Tumed Banner.

    He also created divisions within the nationalities, forcibly dividing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into two opposing parts, east and west. He said that Mongolians from the east have "closed-doorism," and Mongolians in the west must have "knocking-on-doorism." He also said, "Mongolians in the east have given Mongolians in the west a hard time! But they (referring to eastern Mongolia) dare not bully this old man, this old man is noted at Chairman Mao’s place.”

    Rong Xiang came from a feudal aristocratic family, and he relied on Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to climb to the throne of the Chief Administrator of the Tumed Banner. When Chiang Kai-shek published the notorious "China's Destiny," denying the existence of various ethnic minorities in China and thus arousing public outrage among people of all ethnic groups across the country, Rong Xiang instead echoed him, publishing the "Theory of Common Origin of Mongolians and Hans," touting absurd arguments such as "the Mongolian people are descendants of the Yellow Emperor and are a branch of the Han nationality."

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Rong Xiang's reactionary activities became even more rampant. In 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against the grasslands, massacring the people of Inner Mongolia, but he demanded that the people of Inner Mongolia not resist the Kuomintang government. He issued a reactionary proclamation, advising Inner Mongolian compatriots to withdraw from the Liberation War. He said that this was a dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and had nothing to do with the Mongols. This proclamation of his had an extremely reactionary effect. At that time, Mu Gedunbao and others in the Chahar League echoed him and threw themselves into the arms of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, embarking on the path against the people. After the Kuomintang occupied Yan'an, Rong Xiang again published a so-called letter to Mongolian youth, calling on them to abandon the darkness (referring to the Communist Party) and embrace the light (Kuomintang).

    This shameless traitor to the Mongolian people also organized the "Anti-Japanese Mongolian Banner Celebration of Return to the Capital Delegation" in 1946, and served as its leader, going to Nanjing to "pay homage" to Chiang Kai-shek, presenting Chiang with a banner reading "Rebuilding the Rivers and Mountains," and the sword used by Kangxi in his personal campaign against Galdan (a Mongolian national hero).

    蒙古族的败类——荣祥
    内蒙古自治区直属机关各族人民在反右派斗争中，彻底揭破了一向伪装蒙古民族利益维护者荣祥反共反人民面目。
    荣祥现任呼和浩特副市长兼文史馆馆长、政协呼市委员会副主席、内蒙古政协委员、内蒙古及市人民代表大会代表等重要职务。这次整风开始后，他立即恶毒地向党进攻，他诬蔑“共产党员有两个来源——主观主义和官僚主义；一个组成部分——宗派主义。”“共产党爱的是胁肩谄笑的人，听的是歌功颂德的话，看到直脖子的人就看不惯，听到说点坏话就听不惯。”他竟然说：“现在还不如清朝哩！”他歪曲历史，挑拨说：“在清朝蒙汉人民还是相安无事的，可是现在呢，互相整得七死八活！”他恬不知耻以土默特旗（在呼和浩特市西面）的“圣雄”（指印度的甘地）自居。土默特旗存在着旗县并存的不合理现象。解放以后，党和政府为加强民族团结，按照当地多数蒙汉人民的愿望加以合理解决。但是荣祥却借此大肆攻击说：“国民党作不出来的事，共产党作出来了。”他煽惑划到呼和浩特的原土默特旗蒙古人民说，“你们找到了后娘，不会有人替你们说话的。将来有冤无处诉，不得不找我老汉来。”暗示只有他才是土默特旗蒙古人民的亲娘。
    他还在民族内部制造分裂，硬把内蒙古自治区分为东西对立的两部。他说，东部来的蒙古人有“关门主义”，我们西部蒙古人得来个“叫门主义”。又说，“东部蒙古人把西部蒙古人整的够呛！可是他们（指东部蒙古）不敢欺侮我老汉，我老汉在毛主席那里挂上号了。”
    荣祥是封建贵族家庭出身，他依靠蒋介石和阎锡山爬上了土默特旗总管的宝座。当蒋介石发表臭名远扬的“中国之命运”，否认中国国内各少数民族的存在，因而激起全国各族人民的公愤时，荣祥反而随声附和，发表“蒙汉同源论”，鼓吹什么“蒙古民族是黄帝子孙，是汉族的一个宗支”等荒谬论调。
    抗战胜利后，荣祥的反动活动更加猖狂了。1947年，国民党反动派大举进攻草原，屠杀内蒙古人民，他却要内蒙古人民不要反抗国民党政府。他发表反动文告，劝告内蒙古同胞退出解放战争。他说这是国共两党之争，与蒙古人无关。他这篇文告起了极大的反动作用。当时察哈尔盟的穆格敦宝等就随声应和，投入了国民党反动统治者的怀抱，走上了反人民的道路。在国民党占领了延安后，荣祥又发表了所谓告蒙古青年书，号召他们弃暗（指共产党）投明（国民党）。
    这个厚颜无耻的蒙古族人民的败类还在1946年组织了“抗日蒙旗庆祝还都代表团”，并自任团长，去南京“晋谒”蒋介石，向蒋呈献“河山再造”锦旗，及康熙亲征噶尔丹（蒙古民族英雄）所用御剑。
