    Exposed the Rightists, Educated Everyone
    Changsha No. 3 Middle School Teachers are Now Awake
    (Reported by this newspaper) In recent days, the faculty and staff of Changsha No. 3 Middle School in Hunan Province have powerfully counterattacked Yang Jihua, a rightist element and Chinese language teacher at the school.
    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Yang Jihua published a reactionary article titled "My Humble Opinions and Sincere Words" in the New Hunan Daily and Changsha Daily, saying that the elections throughout the country were monopolized by sectarianism and that elections might as well be called factional appointments. He said that sectarianism had become a widespread disaster throughout the country. After this vicious article was published, it aroused great indignation among people from all walks of life in the province. The New Hunan Daily successively published many articles and reader letters exposing and refuting him. As a result, he hated the Party newspaper even more, and incited some teachers with wavering stances in the school to jointly oppose the New Hunan Daily and those who refuted him, saying that they were "beating people to death with one blow" and even cursing them as spies. However, in the anti-rightist struggle, Yang Jihua's reactionary face became increasingly clear. According to the exposure, this "hero" in the educational circles who actively opposed the Party was stirring up trouble with the support of Du Maizhi, a key rightist element and secretary-general of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. In recent anti-rightist rallies, faculty and staff exposed many of Yang Jihua's reactionary words and deeds. Some teachers also reviewed their past lack of understanding for falling for rightist elements, and expressed that they would draw a clear line with Yang Jihua in the future. When Zeng Yanbin talked about the signing issue, he said that signing to oppose the New Hunan Daily was actually completely taking a stand against the people. Cheng Guangli said that he only wanted to offer some suggestions to the Party newspaper, hoping for gentle and mild criticism. Subjectively, he did not sympathize with Yang, but signing actually supported his reactionary behavior. Now they have all firmly established their positions and are continuing to investigate and criticize Yang Jihua's reactionary words and deeds.

### 揭露了右派　教育了大家  长沙三中教员现在清醒了

    揭露了右派　教育了大家
    长沙三中教员现在清醒了
    本报讯　连日来湖南长沙市第三中学的教职员，有力地反击了该校的语文教员右派分子杨继华。
    杨继华在整风开始时，曾在新湖南报和长沙日报上发表了一篇反动文章“我的管见和忠言”，说全国上下的选举是宗派主义包办的，选举不如干脆叫派举。说宗派主义在全国已泛滥成灾了。这篇恶毒的文章发表后，曾激起了全省各界人士的极大愤慨，新湖南报连续发表了许多揭发和驳他的文章、读者来信。因而他更加痛恨党报，就在该校煽动了一些立场不稳的教员，联名反对新湖南报和驳斥他的人，说他们是“一棍子打死”，甚至骂他们为特务。但是在反右派斗争中，杨继华的反动面目，越来越暴露得清楚了。据揭发这个教育界的积极反党的“英雄”，原来是在右派骨干分子、民盟长沙市组织的秘书长杜迈之的支持下兴风作浪的。在近来的几次反击右派的大会上，教职员们揭发了杨继华的许多反动言行，有些教员并检讨自己过去认识不清上了右派分子的当，表示今后要和杨继华划清界限。曾炎斌谈到签名问题时说，签名反对新湖南报的作法，实际上是完全站到了反人民立场上。程光澧说他只是想给党报提点意见，希望和风细雨地批判，主观上并不同情他，但这样签名实际上支持了他的反动行为。现在他们都已站稳了立场，正在继续追查批判杨继华的反动言行。
