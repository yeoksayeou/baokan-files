Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Recently, American soldiers have continued to create new atrocities in Taiwan.

According to Taiwan newspapers, on June 30th, four sailors from the U.S. military vessel No. 105, which was docked in Kaohsiung harbor, used the excuse of "accompanying" swimming to drag four young Taiwanese women to the sea off Fuxing Village in Qijin District, where they insulted them and then pushed them into the turbulent sea. These women were later rescued by several fishermen.

On the highway in Xinshi Township, Tainan County, three American soldiers from the U.S. Air Force's 13th Air Task Force drove a truck loaded with gasoline, speeding recklessly on the highway and overturning an oncoming truck. The gasoline truck immediately caught fire and burned for more than three hours. In the streets of Taipei, incidents of American soldiers on motorcycles hitting pedestrians have also been occurring frequently recently.

In Kaohsiung, Taipei, and other places, many American soldiers who have been rotated here for leave are rampaging through the streets, throwing bottles at residents, and chasing after women with wild shouts as soon as they see them.

    污辱妇女  驾车肇事
    美军在台湾照旧胡作非为
    新华社18日讯  最近，美军又在台湾不断制造新的暴行事件。
    据台湾报纸透露，6月30日，停泊在高雄港口的一○五号美军军舰上的四个水兵，借“偕同”游泳为名，把四个年轻的台湾妇女拉到旗津区复兴里外海加以污辱，然后把她们推下波涛汹涌的大海里。这几个妇女后来被几个渔民救起来。
    在台南县新市乡公路上，美国空军第十三航空特遣队的三个美军驾驶了一辆载有汽油的卡车，在公路上乱开飞车，将对面一辆货车撞翻。汽油车随即起火燃烧，大火继续了三个多小时。在台北市街道上，最近也时常发生美军摩托车撞伤行人的事件。
    在高雄、台北等地，许多轮换到这里休假的美国士兵，满街乱闯，酒瓶朝居民乱掷，一见女人就狂叫着追扑。
