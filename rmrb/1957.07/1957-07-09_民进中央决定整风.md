    The Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy Decides to Rectify

    (Our dispatch) The ninth expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy was held on the morning of July 7th.

    The meeting discussed and approved the "Instructions on Carrying Out the Rectification Movement within the Association." The instructions pointed out that the main content of the rectification within the association is the anti-Rightist struggle. It requires organizations in various regions to examine and correct the political direction and political stance of leaders at all levels within the association; to expose and criticize the thoughts, words, and deeds of Rightists, and strictly draw a line between them and all thoughts that oppose the Chinese Communist Party and oppose socialism.

    The instructions stated that the rectification movement is different from ordinary theoretical study and life reviews. The words and deeds of Rightists must be thoroughly exposed and thoroughly criticized without any leniency. For those with general confused ideas or those whose thinking is influenced by Rightists, the main task is to enable them to distinguish right from wrong, draw a clear line, and correct their stance through the struggle against Rightists.

    The instructions pointed out that the steps of the rectification movement within the association should closely cooperate with the steps of the CCP's rectification. Rectification will not be carried out for the time being in areas, organs, schools, and enterprises where the CCP has not yet started rectification. The instructions also stipulated that no new members will be approved from the time the Central Committee decides to start rectification, and organizations in various regions are required to strictly implement this.

    The meeting decided to establish a Central Rectification Leadership Group and a Central Rectification Office. The members of the leading group are: Conveners: Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao, Zhou Jianren, Xu Guangping, Che Xiangchen, Yang Dongchun. Members: Wu Ruo'an, Wu Yifang, Yu Zhijie, Chen Lijie, Chen Hui, Ke Ling, Xu Boxin, Xu Chongqing, Xu Chubo, Zhang Tingqian, Liang Chunfu, Liang Ming, Feng Binfu, Zhang Mingyang, Zhang Jiyuan, Lei Jieqiong, Yang Shixian, Zhao Puchu, Ge Zhicheng, Yan Jingyao. The members of the Rectification Office are: Director Yang Dongchun, Deputy Directors Xu Boxin, Feng Binfu, Ge Zhicheng, Liang Ming.

    The meeting also decided to postpone the fourth session of the Second Plenary Session, originally scheduled to be held in mid-August, in order to concentrate efforts on carrying out the rectification movement within the association.

    The meeting studied the issue of the China Association for Promoting Democracy branch of Caoyang Middle School in Shanghai, unanimously condemned the anti-Party behavior of the China Association for Promoting Democracy branch of Caoyang Middle School, and instructed the Central Committee to promptly handle this issue and make corresponding decisions to be reported to various regions.

    Vice Chairman Xu Guangping presided over the meeting. Thirty-four people attended the meeting, including Central Standing Committee members, Central Committee members, alternate Central Committee members, and heads of various departments in Beijing.
