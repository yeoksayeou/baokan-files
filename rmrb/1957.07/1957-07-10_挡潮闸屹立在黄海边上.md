    The Tide Gate Stands Tall on the Edge of the Yellow Sea
    Tan Tan Poem Zhou Lingzhao Illustration
The tide gate stands tall on the edge of the Yellow Sea,
The sea sends fish to visit,
The fish glance at the great gate,
And wag their tails back to the ocean.

The tide gate stands tall on the edge of the Yellow Sea,
The sea sends birds to visit,
The birds chirp at the great gate,
And flap their wings back to the ocean.

The tide gate stands tall on the edge of the Yellow Sea,
The sea sends the wind to visit again,
The wind echoes around the great gate for a while,
And whistles back to the ocean.

The tide gate stands tall on the edge of the Yellow Sea,
The sea comes to visit in person,
The sea uses all its strength to strike several times,
And obediently lies beside the great gate. (Attached picture)

    挡潮闸屹立在黄海边上
    谭潭  诗  周令钊  插图挡潮闸屹立在黄海边上，大海派鱼儿来探望，鱼儿向大闸瞟了几眼，摇着尾巴溜回海洋。挡潮闸屹立在黄海边上，大海派鸟儿来探望，鸟儿向大闸鸣叫了几声，拍着翅膀逃回海洋。挡潮闸屹立在黄海边上，大海又派风儿来探望，风儿绕大闸回响了一阵，打着呼哨窜回海洋。挡潮闸屹立在黄海边上，大海亲自来探望，大海用尽气力撞了几撞，乖乖地躺卧在大闸的身旁。（附图片）
