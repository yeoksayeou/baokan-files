Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, July 20th: According to reports in local newspapers on the 17th, the current President of the United Nations General Assembly, Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon, told the press on the 16th that although some people in the United Nations have advocated the idea of "Two Chinas," he believes this statement is contrary to the facts.

Wan Waithayakon said that Taiwan is an indivisible part of China's territory, and any attempt to separate Taiwan from China is contrary to international law and international practice.

He said that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and he believes that mainland China and Taiwan should privately seek a way to avoid bloodshed and achieve unification.

When talking about the issue of recognizing China, Wan Waithayakon said that according to international principles, the "Chinese Communist government" is the true and legitimate government of China, but at present, Thailand does not recognize the "Chinese Communist government," which is a matter of Thai policy. Thailand will only recognize it after this government joins the United Nations.

Wan Waithayakon also talked about the issue of abolishing the "Anti-Communist Act." He said that careful consideration must be given, because he is afraid that abolishing this regulation would cause foreign countries to misunderstand Thailand.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: Nai Khlai Naraphati, Secretary-General of the Socialist United Front of Thailand and member of parliament, said on the 10th that China is an Asian power with a population of 600 million and has a significant impact on world peace. An international disarmament conference without China's participation would be meaningless.

Nai Amphorn Suwannabhongse, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and member of parliament, also told the press on the 11th that China must participate in the international disarmament conference, because China is in fact a major power in the world, and its strength cannot be ignored.

    泰国外长承认台湾是中国的一部分
    不同意“两个中国”的说法
    新华社20日讯　曼谷消息：据此间报纸17日报道，现任联合国大会主席的泰国外交部长那拉底16日向报界发表谈话说，在联合国中虽然曾有人主张“两个中国”的说法，但是，他认为这是违反事实的说法。
    那拉底说，台湾是中国的不可分割的领土的一部分，任何企图将台湾从中国分开的主张，都是违背国际法和国际惯例的。
    他说，台湾问题是中国内政问题，他认为中国大陆方面和台湾方面应该自己私下寻求避免流血的统一办法。
    那拉底在谈到对中国的承认问题时说，依照国际原则，“中国共产党政府”是中国的真正合法的政府，但是，目前泰国还不承认“中国共产党政府”，这是泰国的政策问题。泰国只有在这个政府加入联合国以后才加以承认。
    那拉底还谈到取消“反共条例”的问题。他说，必须作周密的考虑，因为恐怕取消这项条例会引起外国对泰国的误会。
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：泰国社会主义联合阵线总书记、议员乃克莱·纳拉帕蒂10日说，中国是一个拥有六亿人口和对世界和平具有重大影响的亚洲大国，国际裁军会议如果没有中国参加将不会有什么意义。
    自由民主党副领袖、议员乃安蓬·素旺那汶11日也向报界发表谈话说，国际裁军会议一定要有中国参加，因为中国事实上是世界上的一个大国，它的力量是不能加以忽视的。
