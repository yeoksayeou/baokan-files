    I Stand on the Flood Control Post
    Zhai Jiahua
    Last year during the flood season, I assisted the Luotai Hydrological Station. This year, the hydrological station moved to Nanchang, and I am still assisting with the work. Now the flood season is upon me, and I am working with my comrades at the station to prepare for everything before the flood season.
    This is the second time I have participated in the flood control battle. When I recall the scenes of 1956, I still find them very interesting. Before the flood came, my work was minimal, just taking observations of water levels, evaporation, rainfall, or groundwater levels at the appointed times, and measuring flow when the water level was high. Sometimes, because there was too little work, I, as a young man, always felt that life was monotonous, and that I had "no place to display my talents." However, when the flood came, it was a different story, it was practically like a battle. Not only did the number of water level observations increase, but flow measurements had to be added according to the situation, and flood reports had to be sent out every hour. At this time, work didn't distinguish between day and night, and we were always busy. In the most tense moments, there was no time to rest, not even to eat. It was even more overwhelming when the river rose and it rained at the same time, a so-called "double attack." Last year, we encountered heavy rain several times. Once, the rain was the heaviest and most urgent. We were measuring the flow on a boat. Rainwater filled the boat's cabin, and the measurers' lower bodies were soaked in water, while their upper bodies were drenched by the rain, and they couldn't open their eyes as the raindrops hit the tops of their heads. At this time, the electric bell of the current meter could no longer be heard, only the sound of rushing rain; we could only feel the vibration in our palms to know that the bell was ringing. The record of the measured flow is the most precious data. We were afraid it would get wet, so we first used umbrellas and raincoats to cover it and the instrument. In this way, we finally persisted in our work for two hours and measured the flow calmly.
    Now, we are about to fight the flood again, and I am standing on my post. Our operation is planned: to seize the highest flood peak and measure the flow.

    我站上了防汛的岗位
    翟加华
    我在去年汛期就协助落垈水文站工作，今年水文站迁移到南昌，我仍然协助工作。现在汛期已摆在我的面前，我和站上的同志一起，在忙着作汛期前的一切准备工作。
    今年我是第二次投入防汛战斗了，1956年的工作情景我回忆起来还觉得很有兴味。当洪水未来之前，我的工作是很少的，只是到时间作水位、蒸发、降雨、或地下水位等观测工作，在水位高时测流量。有时由于工作太少，对我这青年人来说，总感到生活单调，觉得“英雄无用武之地”。可是，洪水到来时，就不是这个样子了，那简直像战斗一样。不但水位观测次数增加，在观测水位的同时，还要依照情况加测流量，每小时都要报汛。这时工作也不分白天黑夜了，总是忙个不止。在最紧张的时候，不但没有休息时间，连吃饭的工夫都没有。遇到河里涨水、天上下雨的所谓“两头进攻”的时候，更要把人忙死。去年我们就赶上好几次下大雨。有一次雨最急最大，我们正在测船上测流。雨水下满了船舱，测量人员下身泡在水里，上身被雨淋着，雨点打在头顶上睁不开眼。这时流速仪的电铃已经听不见，尽是哗哗哗的雨点响了；只有把手放在电铃上感觉手心振动才知道铃响。测得流量的记载是最宝贵的资料。我们怕它淋湿了，把雨伞雨衣首先遮住它和仪器。就这样，我们终于坚持了两小时的工作，不慌不忙地测得了流量。
    现在，我们又要和洪水作战斗了，我站上了我的岗位。我们的作战是有计划的：抓着最高洪峰，测得流量。
