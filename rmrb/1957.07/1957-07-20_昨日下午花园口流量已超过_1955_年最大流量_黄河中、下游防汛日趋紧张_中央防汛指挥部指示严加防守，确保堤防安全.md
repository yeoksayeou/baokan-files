    Yesterday Afternoon, Flow at Huayuankou Exceeded the Maximum Flow of 1955
    Flood Control in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yellow River Becoming Increasingly Tense
    Central Flood Control Headquarters Instructs to Defend Strictly and Ensure the Safety of Dikes
    (By our reporter) This newspaper reports that flood control work along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River is becoming increasingly tense. As of 3:00 PM on the 19th, the flow at Huayuankou near Zhengzhou, Henan, which controls the Yellow River water level, had increased from 7,040 cubic meters per second at 9:00 AM on the 18th to 12,600 cubic meters per second, exceeding the maximum flow during the 1955 flood season. Within Shandong Province, the Yellow River flood peak will meet the Wen River flood peak, causing the water level of Dongping Lake to rise, creating a tense situation on the west dike of the Grand Canal. Currently, some areas in Dongming and Puyang counties in Henan Province east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and Fanxian, Shouzhang, Heze, Juancheng, and Yuncheng counties in Shandong Province have been inundated. Under the leadership of the local Party and government leadership organs, farmers in these areas are going to the dikes to defend them.
    In order to ensure the safety of the people and farmland along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and to overcome the flood disaster, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has issued urgent instructions to the affiliated institutions in Henan and Shandong provinces, requiring responsible cadres at all levels to immediately go to the dikes, strengthen defenses day and night, pay attention to changes in dangerous works, and make preparations for relocation and rescue work in advance in inundated areas; at the same time, strengthen the defense of Dongping Lake to ensure the safety of the west dike of the Grand Canal. The Central Flood Control Headquarters also instructed the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters on the 19th to strictly defend and ensure the safety of the dikes. (Pei)

    昨日下午花园口流量已超过1955年最大流量
    黄河中、下游防汛日趋紧张
    中央防汛指挥部指示严加防守，确保堤防安全
    本报讯  黄河中、下游沿岸的防汛工作日趋紧张。截至19日下午三时止，河南郑州附近控制黄河水位的花园口，流量已由18日上午九时的七千零四十秒公方增至一万二千六百秒公方，超过了1955年汛期的最大流量。山东境内，黄河洪峰将与汶河的洪峰相遇，使东平湖的水位升高，运河西堤出现紧张局面。现在，京汉路以东河南省的东明、濮阳及山东省的范县、寿张、菏泽、鄄城、郓城等县部分地区已经漫滩。这些地方的农民正在当地党政领导机关的领导下，上堤固守堤防。
    为了确保黄河中、下游沿岸人民和农田的安全，战胜洪水灾害，黄河防汛总指挥部已向河南、山东两省所属机构下达紧急指示，要求各级负责干部立即上堤，昼夜加强防守，注意险工变化，并在漫滩地区事先作好迁移救护工作；同时，要加强东平湖的防御工作，确保运河西堤的安全。中央防汛总指挥部亦于19日指示黄河防汛总指挥部，要严加防守，确保堤防安全。  （裴）
