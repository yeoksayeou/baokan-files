The edge of the ink-green women's handbag placed on the table vaguely revealed a doctor's white coat and a section of a stethoscope's thin rubber tube. Zheng Min, as usual, after her night shift, on her day off, came from the hospital to Ma Song's house in the afternoon. Her face shone with a smile as she placed a bunch of small purple flowers in the cloisonné vase on the window sill, then quietly sat down on the edge of the bed.

She didn't know how to tell the matter to Ma Song, who had been bedridden for a long time. This seemingly weak but very stubborn person! They were both junior high school graduates when the country was liberated. A few days after graduation, Ma Song unfortunately contracted an incurable bone disease, which paralyzed him, locking this lively young man in a plaster bed day and night, almost eight years now since this summer.

This is truly a severe life experience! When the attending physician said with a comforting and encouraging tone, "Young man, muster up your courage and challenge life!" that meant this chronic disease could keep a person lingering in bed for eight to ten years, or even longer. Ma Song silently bit his lip, his vision blurred. At that time, he was just a teenager, in the golden age of his life, when a person at this age generally feels they have inexhaustible strength. Even as a child, he longed to travel to the world's famous docks one day, or at least tour China's famous mountains and rivers, spending several years of fresh and meaningful days. Now fate had arranged for him to lie in bed! "Youth" was truly a strange and extraordinary word for him. He recalled when he first fell ill eight years ago, it was the year when the people of the whole country celebrated liberation: when people gathered from all directions on the thoroughfares to welcome the solemn ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army passing through the city center, Ma Song, under the small window of his house, listened attentively to the joyous and excited sounds like a surging sea, closed his eyes and imagined the scene of red flags like a sea and everyone in the streets; he struggled to get out of bed, but a burning pain from his spine to his legs rendered all his efforts futile. Under that small north window, he could look up and see a distant corner of blue sky. For the first time, he packed up his boundless fantasies of his youth, becoming silent and somewhat melancholy.

After the initial feeling of despair was finally overcome, Ma Song then calmly reconsidered his life path: studying. Through radio broadcasts, he stubbornly studied Russian, catching up with the progress of a year and a half in just one or two months. He wrote to a professor at the Conservatory of Music, asking for help in learning composition; unexpectedly, he received a passionate reply, so he leaned on his pillow to study "Harmony." In short, he was living solidly and confidently.

One bright sunny morning in early May, a dozen young people gathered around Ma Song's bedside and held a special branch meeting. The district's Communist Youth League organization listened to the report made by this youth who was sick in bed, acknowledged his tenacious work in studying and the courageous attitude he had taken towards the painful illness, approved Ma Song's application to join the League, and encouraged him to break through all obstacles and move forward for the glorious cause of communism.

This was an unusual gathering. The small room was crowded with people. Everyone listened seriously as Ma Song, in his unique low and powerful voice, talked about how to overcome the unbearable loneliness and impatience in illness, and later how to draw strength and inspiration from Ostrovsky. When he said on the plaster bed, "Life is beautiful, but life is also cruel to me," several female League members were in tears, and all stepped forward to the bed to shake hands tightly with Ma Song. From that day on, Zheng Min and Ma Song became closer.

Zheng Min was Ma Song's classmate in junior high school. After graduating from junior high school, Zheng Min smoothly advanced to high school and then entered medical school. Since last year, she had been participating in internships in various departments of the affiliated hospital, and this summer happened to be the graduating class of 1957. Over the years, regardless of wind or rain, and regardless of how different the circumstances were between the two, Zheng Min would definitely visit Ma Song every few days, bringing him all kinds of exciting news from the outside world.

Today, Zheng Min came earlier than usual: after the routine ward rounds in the morning, she didn't go home to change clothes and rushed over. She had something very important to tell Ma Song, but after entering the room, she didn't know how to say it.

She was too familiar with this small room: around Ma Song's bed were piled thick Russian dictionaries, various music theory textbooks, an unfinished biography of a Soviet singer, scattered pages of sheet music full of notes, a large number of books, newspapers, magazines, and symphony scores, and so on. Every time she came here, she always cleaned up these scattered papers and books, which had almost become a habit of hers. The cloisonné vase placed on the windowsill was a birthday gift she gave him, and the vase was often filled with a small bouquet of flowers she brought; in the large glass tank placed on the small table, the green water plants and several red goldfish complemented each other, this was specially brought to Ma Song by the Young Pioneers from the nearby elementary school after they returned from an excursion; nailed to the wall were half-length portraits of Beethoven and Mayakovsky, under the pensive portraits lay a young man who, although he had lost his health, was full of vitality, all this was so dear to Zheng Min, ah, now she realized how difficult it was to leave this room!

She was facing the eve of graduation from medical school. A few days ago, when the school discussed the unified job assignment, she volunteered to go to remote areas where medical staff were most needed. The head of the department, a famous orthopedic expert, who knew about the relationship between his prized student Zheng Min and Ma Song, felt strange about this student's volunteer, because if she was willing to stay, she could get organizational consideration, which was often what many people sought. But she said, "No." Why? She herself couldn't say for sure, but one thing was certain, that was she felt it was beneficial to the country to do so. She couldn't let down the Party's education of her.

Ma Song looked at Zheng Min with some surprise as she took the stethoscope out of the green handbag and put it back in. Zheng Min kept trying to find something to say: the hospital ward admitted several more patients yesterday, one of whom, a patient with high blood pressure, was in a dangerous condition. During the late night shift last night, the nurse called her eight times, and later, near dawn, she simply didn't want to sleep. She stood on the large balcony outside the fourth-floor ward for a long time, watching the morning star twinkle in the sky like a cunning green cat's eye stone. ("Strange metaphor!" Ma Song thought.) When she returned to the room, she found that the heavy dew of the night had almost soaked her white coat.

"Is something the matter, Zheng Min?" Ma Song couldn't help but ask.

Zheng Min nodded. Then she said quickly in one breath: "Yes, Ma Song. My request to go to the Northeast or Northwest to participate in medical work has been approved, and I may be leaving as soon as a notice comes down. This is my wish. Don't you blame me for not telling you beforehand?"

A moment of silence. Zheng Min was a little worried and didn't look up at him. After a while, she only heard Ma Song say calmly:

"Let me congratulate you, Zheng Min. You should go, to those places that need you. You are not my doctor alone, you are the doctor of thousands of people together, aren't you? You are fulfilling the long-held wish that I have been unable to fulfill: to be able to personally see the construction of socialism, to travel all over the country, to understand the new face of our country, how happy I am."

"Thank you, Ma Song, you are strong."

"But, after you leave, maybe I will never see you again—the doctor said yesterday that I may have to lie like this for another three to five years, you see!"

"If you are willing to wait for me, I will definitely come back to see you!" Zheng Min said in a low voice.

Now she understood: wasn't her going to remote areas also for Ma Song? Wasn't dedicating youth to the motherland their common wish?

Ma Song gazed affectionately at Zheng Min: as if he had truly seen her for the first time in seven or eight years. He held her hand, and she held it back, replacing many unspeakable words. At this moment, looking out from the small window: after the rain, the sky was full of colorful clouds shining on a fresh green leaf, and the moist fragrance of magnolia trees floated in the air, this was a memorable dusk in early summer.

    青春之歌
    何为
    放在桌上的墨绿色女用手提包边缘，隐约露出一件医生用的白色罩衣和一段听诊器的细橡皮管。郑敏还是像往常一样，值夜班后的第二天轮到她休假时，从医院里出来，下午就到马松家里。她脸上闪耀着微笑，把一束紫色的小花放在窗口的景泰蓝花瓶里，随即悄悄在床沿坐下来。
    她不知道怎样开口把这件事告诉长期卧病的马松。这个看来很瘦弱却是非常倔强的人！全国解放时他们都还是初中毕业生。毕业后数天，马松不幸得了一种难治的骨病，形同瘫痪，就这样把一个生龙活虎似的青年日日夜夜锁在石膏床上，算来到今夏差不多整整有八年了。
    这真是一场严酷的人生经历啊！当主治医师带着宽慰和鼓励的语气说：“年青人，拿出勇气来，向生命挑战吧！”那就是说这种慢性病可能使人在病床上盘桓十年八年，甚至更长一些。马松默默地咬着嘴唇，眼前一片昏黑。那时他还只是个十几岁的少年，正当生命中的黄金时代，一个人在这样的年龄大抵总感到自己有使用不尽的力量。还在童年时，他就渴望有一天能旅行全世界著名的码头，至少也要周游全中国的名山大川，度过若干年新鲜而有意义的日子。现在命运却安排他躺在床上！“青春”，对他来说真是一个奇异的不平凡的字眼呀。他回想起八年前开始生病的时候，正是全国人民庆祝解放的那年：当人们从四面八方汇集到通衢大道上欢迎中国人民解放军庄严的行列通过城市的中心的时候，马松在自己屋子的小窗下，侧耳谛听像奔腾的海那样欢悦激动的声音，闭目想像红旗如海万人空巷的场面，他挣扎着想起床出去，可是从脊梁到腿部一阵烧炙般的疼痛使他所有的努力都归于徒然。在那扇小小的北窗下，仰首可以望见远远一角蓝天。第一次他收拾起少年时代无边的幻想，变得沉默而且有些忧郁了。
    最初到来的绝望之感终于被战胜了以后，马松随即冷静下来重新考虑自己的生活道路：学习。通过收音机的广播，他顽强地学习俄文，一两个月就赶上了人家一年半载的进度。他写信给音乐院一位教授，请求帮助他学习作曲，意外地他接到一封热情洋溢的回信，于是他倚在枕上研究“和声学”。总之，他是结结实实地满怀信心地生活着。
    五月初一个阳光辉朗的早上，十几个年青人围着马松的床边，召开了一个特别的支部大会。本区的团组织听取了这个病在床上的青年所作的汇报，承认他在学习上顽强的劳动和对于痛苦的疾病所采取的勇敢态度，批准了马松申请入团的要求，并且勉励他为共产主义的光荣事业，突破一切障碍向前迈进。
    这是一次不平常的集会。小屋子里挤满了人。大家严肃地听着马松以他自己独有的低沉有力的声音，谈到如何克服病中难耐的寂寞和急躁情绪，以及后来如何从奥斯特洛夫斯基那里汲取力量，得到鼓舞。当他在石膏床上说起“生活是美好的，但是生活对我也是残酷的”这样的话，几个女青年团员都噙着热泪，齐趋床前向马松紧紧握手。从那天以后，郑敏和马松更接近了。
    郑敏是马松在初中时代的同班同学。初中毕业后，郑敏就一帆风顺地升到高中又进了医学院，从去年起在附属医院里参加各科实习，到今年暑期刚好是应届的1957级医科大学毕业生。这许多年来，不管刮风下雨，也不管两人之间的境遇有多么不同，郑敏隔些日子必来探望马松，同时给他带来了外面世界各种令人兴奋的消息。
    今天郑敏来得比往常早些：上午例行的巡查病房结束后，没有回家换衣服，就急忙赶来了。她有一件非常重要的事告诉马松，可是进了屋子后却又不知道该怎样说才好。
    这间小屋子对她是太熟悉了：马松的床边四周堆着大本俄文辞典，各种乐理教程，一本没有译完的苏联歌唱家的传记，一些画满音符的五线谱散页，大批书报杂志和交响乐乐谱等等。每一次她到这里来，总是把这些四分五散的纸张书本收拾得干干净净，这几乎成为她的一种习惯了。那摆在窗口的景泰蓝花瓶是她送给他的一件生日礼物，瓶子里经常插着她带来的一扎小小的花束；那放在小桌上一只大玻璃缸里，碧绿的水草和几尾红色小金鱼相映成趣，这是附近小学校里的少先队员们远足归来，特地带来送给马松的；那墙上钉着贝多芬和马雅可夫斯基的半身画像，沉思的画像下躺着一个虽然失去了健康却是生命力充沛的青年，所有这些对郑敏是如此亲切，啊，现在她才发现要离开这间屋子有多么困难！
    她面临医科大学毕业前夜，前些日子学校里讨论统一分配工作时，她志愿到最需要医务工作人员的边远地方去。系主任，一位著名的骨科专家，了解他的得意学生郑敏和马松之间一些情况，对这个学生的志愿感到奇怪，因为如果她愿意留下，她是可以得到组织上照顾的，而这往往正是许多人所企求的。可是她却说：“不。”为什么？她自己也不一定十分确切地说得清楚，不过有一点是可以肯定的，那就是她觉得这样做对祖国是有利的。她不能辜负党对她的教育。
    马松有些惊异地望着郑敏把听诊器从绿色手提包里拿出来又放进去。郑敏尽是找话说：医院的病房里昨天又收了几个病人，其中有一个患高血压的重病人处在危险状态中，昨天下半夜值班时有八次给护士叫了起来，后来到了将近天亮时索性就不想睡了。在四楼病房外的大阳台上站了半天，看启明星像诡谲的绿色猫眼石一样在天边闪烁。（“奇怪的比喻！”马松想。）回到屋里才发现夜来浓重的露水几乎把白罩衣都淌湿了。
      “你像有什么事是吗，郑敏？”马松忍不住问。
    郑敏点点头。接着一口气说得很快：“是的，马松。我要求到东北或者是西北去参加医疗工作已经批准了，说不定一个通知下来就要动身，这是我的志愿，事先我没有告诉你，你怪我吗？”
    一刹那沉默。郑敏有些担心，没有抬头看他。过了一会，只听见马松沉静地说：
      “让我祝贺你，郑敏。你应该走，到那些需要你的地方去。你不是我一个人的医生，你是千万个人共同的医生，不是吗？你代替我实现了多年来没法如愿的想望：能够亲自去看看社会主义的建设，天南地北地到处走走，认识一下我们祖国崭新的面貌，我有多高兴呀。”
      “谢谢你，马松，你是坚强的。”
      “可是，你走了以后，可能我再也看不到你了——昨天医生说我也许还要这样躺上三五年，你看！”
      “如果你愿意等我，我一定还回来看你！”郑敏低声说。
    现在她明白了：她之所以要到边远的地方去岂不是也为了马松吗？把青春献给祖国，难道不是他们共同的愿望吗？
    马松深情地凝视着郑敏：仿佛七、八年来第一次真正看见了她。他握着她的手，她也握着，代替了许多无法诉说的话。这时从小小的窗口望出去：雨后，满天彩霞照着一片清新的绿叶，空气中飘浮着玉兰花树湿润的幽香，这是在初夏时节一个充满了记忆的黄昏。
