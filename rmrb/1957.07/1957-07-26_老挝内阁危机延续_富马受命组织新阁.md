Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th. Vientiane Radio announced tonight that the King of Laos has instructed Prince Souvanna Phouma to form a new cabinet.

The Lao Royal Office telegraphed Prince Phouma in Vientiane this morning from Luang Prabang, stating that after Katay Don Sasorith formally expressed his abandonment of forming a cabinet, Prince Savang had held talks with some important political figures. Subsequently, the King made the decision to instruct Prince Phouma to carry out the task of forming a cabinet.

After receiving the telegram instructing him to form a new cabinet, Phouma immediately telegraphed back to thank the King, and stated that he would respond on the question of whether to accept the task of forming a cabinet within twenty-four hours at the latest. The cabinet crisis has continued since Prince Phouma resigned as Prime Minister of Laos on May 30th.

Vientiane Radio broadcast last night that Katay Don Sasorith, leader of the Lao National Party, issued a statement on the 24th, announcing that he had been "forced to refuse to form a new cabinet."

    老挝内阁危机延续
    富马受命组织新阁
    新华社河内25日电　据万象电台今晚广播，老挝国王已经授命梭发那·富马亲王组织新内阁。
    老挝皇廷办公厅在今天上午从琅?拉邦打电报给在万象的富马亲王说，在卡代·萨索里特正式表示放弃组阁以后，沙旺王子曾经同一些重要政界人士举行会谈，随后，国王作出了授命富马亲王进行组阁工作的决定。
    富马在接到授命他组织新阁的电报后，立即回电感谢国王，并且表示至迟在二十四小时内，他将就是否接受组阁任务问题作出答复。富马亲王在5月30日辞去老挝首相职务以后，内阁危机一直延续到现在。
    据万象电台昨天晚上广播，老挝国家党领袖卡代·萨索里特24日发表声明，宣布他已经“被迫拒绝组织新内阁”。
