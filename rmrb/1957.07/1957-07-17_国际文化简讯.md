    "Bel Ami" Ban Lifted; "Les Misérables" to be Made into Film

    A Bengali film with the theme of Sino-Indian friendship is currently being produced in Calcutta. The film is titled "Under the Blue Sky." It will depict international friendship and brotherly feelings in a world troubled by conflict and tension. The film is based on the original Hindi work by the famous female poet Verma, and it describes the story of a homesick Chinese peddler who finds a new family and friends among the Indian people.
    The excellent director Hazarika will be responsible for directing this film. First-class stars from the Bengali film industry and other Indian and Chinese actors are participating in the filming.

    Victor Hugo's famous work "Les Misérables" is about to be made into a film. It will be jointly produced by the DEFA film company of Democratic Germany and film companies from France and Italy. The famous film director Paul will direct.

    The French government was recently forced to lift the ban on the screening of the film "Bel Ami," based on Maupassant's novel of the same name. This is the result of more than two years of struggle by French filmmakers and the general public.
    This color film is a joint production of French and Australian film companies. It has been shown in some European countries, but has not been able to be screened in France due to obstruction by the French government.
    This film will soon be dubbed and screened in China as well.

    A nobleman's tomb dating back nearly two thousand years has recently been excavated in Hereford, England. The tomb contained the wreckage of a chariot, some large pieces of curved iron bars, copper bars, and fourteen buttons inlaid with beautiful enamel. In addition, there was a glass bowl and some pottery.

    According to a person from the British Museum, this discovery is a valuable find for archeology. Some also speculate that this tomb is the tomb of King Cunobelinus. A character named Cymbeline in Shakespeare's play is based on him. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “漂亮朋友”禁令已解除  “悲惨世界”将拍成电影
    一部以印中友谊为主题的孟加拉语影片正在加尔各答摄制中。这部影片的片名叫做“在蓝天下”。它将表现出被冲突和紧张局势所困扰的世界中的国际情谊和兄弟感情。影片是根据著名女诗人维尔马的印地文原著改编的，它描写一个思家的中国小贩在印度人民中找到了新的家庭和朋友的故事。
    优秀导演哈查里卡将负责导演这部影片。孟加拉电影界第一流的明星和其他印度和中国演员们参加了这部影片的拍摄。
    雨果的名著“悲惨世界”即将摄成电影。它将由民主德国德发电影公司和法、意两国的电影公司联合摄制。由著名的电影导演保尔担任导演。
    法国政府不久前被迫取消了不准上映根据莫泊桑同名小说摄制的影片“漂亮朋友”的禁令。这是法国电影工作者和广大观众两年多来斗争的结果。
    这部彩色影片是法国和澳大利亚的影片公司联合摄制的。它在欧洲一些国家已经放映过，但是由于法国政府的阻挠，一直没有能够在法国上映。
    这部影片不久也将在中国复制放映。
    英格兰赫弗德地方最近发掘出将近两千年前的一座贵族的坟墓。墓里有一辆车子的残骸、一些大块的弯曲的铁条、铜条和十四颗镶着漂亮的珐琅的钮扣。此外，还有一只玻璃碗和一部分陶器。
    据英国博物馆一个人说，这次发现是考古学的一次宝贵的发现。也有人猜测，这个坟墓是库努贝林国王的墓。沙士比亚笔下的一个叫辛贝林的人物就是以他为根据的。　（新华社）
