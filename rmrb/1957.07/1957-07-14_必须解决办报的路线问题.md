    The Issue of the Newspaper's Direction Must Be Resolved
    Wang Yunsheng said: The six political criteria given to us by Chairman Mao are our standards and position for running a newspaper.
    In a socialist country, running a socialist newspaper should be a matter of course. Who knew that this issue has not been truly resolved.
    Chairman Mao told us: In our country, "the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie is just being transformed. Class struggle has not ended." This rampant attack on the Party, the people, and socialism launched by the bourgeois right-wingers is precisely a form of class struggle. In this struggle, the Zhang-Luo Alliance's offensive was the most ferocious. They not only occupied leadership positions in two parties but also usurped control of two newspapers. The fact that the Zhang-Luo Alliance usurped the Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily for a period of time as their propaganda tools demonstrates that the issue of the newspaper's direction has not been truly resolved. As a journalist, I feel extremely heavy-hearted about this objective reality.
    The People's Daily once pointed out: "In a socialist country, newspapers are a reflection of the socialist economy, i.e., the planned economy based on public ownership, through news media, which is different from capitalist countries where newspapers are a reflection of the anarchic and competitive economy of groups through news media." Some of our journalists have not fully understood the difference between these two types of newspapers. Therefore, some individual newspapers adopt bourgeois means of running a newspaper, treating the newspaper as a purely commercial commodity and using poisonous content to attract readers. Wenhui Daily was like this for a period of time.
    Newspapers have ample political character. The relationship between a newspaper and its readers is more than just a few cents for a copy. In a socialist country, running a socialist newspaper must serve socialism. This is a matter of direction and cannot be deviated from in the slightest. What position should a newspaper of the People's Republic of China take, what should it support, and what should it oppose – these must be crystal clear. The six political criteria given to us by Chairman Mao are: (1) It should be conducive to the unity of all nationalities of the country, not to dividing the people; (2) It should be conducive to socialist transformation and socialist construction, not detrimental to socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) It should be conducive to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, not to undermining or weakening this dictatorship; (4) It should be conducive to consolidating democratic centralism, not to undermining or weakening this system; (5) It should be conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, not to shaking off or weakening this leadership; (6) It should be conducive to socialist international unity and the international unity of peace-loving people all over the world, not detrimental to this unity. These six criteria are our standards for running a newspaper, our position for running a newspaper. The Guangming Daily under Chu Anping's editorship and Wenhui Daily for a recent period completely deviated from the socialist line, playing all sorts of tricks to undermine these six criteria.
    Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, these two ambitious individuals, knew the importance of newspapers. Zhang Bojun, holding the position of President of Guangming Daily, took advantage of the Party's withdrawal of the Party member editor-in-chief and colluded with Chu Anping to push Guangming Daily in a bourgeois direction. Wenhui Daily was originally a very progressive newspaper, but because Xu Zhucheng was unwilling to honestly run a socialist newspaper on the socialist path, he turned Wenhui Daily into a ferocious tool of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. The Party and the people supported the resumption of Wenhui Daily's publication, but Xu Zhucheng was grateful to the Zhang-Luo clique, participated in secret plots, sent people to stir up trouble everywhere, and the newspaper was filled with gales every day, launching a rampant attack on the Party, the people, and socialism. Luo Longji – Pu Xixiu – the Wenhui Daily editorial department, this right-wing system of the China Democratic League stirred up trouble in Wenhui Daily, and Xu Zhucheng, in charge of the Wenhui Daily editorial department, made great efforts in this regard.
    Xu Zhucheng has many years of experience in running newspapers and also has intelligence and talent. After eight years of liberation, the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved brilliant victories and significant achievements. Why did he join the Zhang-Luo Alliance in engaging in capitalist restoration? Roughly speaking, Xu Zhucheng has three problems: First, he is fond of fame. He is very concerned about fame. He was dissatisfied with being nominated as an alternate representative to the first CPPCC and called himself a "survivor of a prosperous dynasty." In fact, if someone truly serves the people and truly does good things for the people, the people will not let him down. Second, he values profit. Xu Zhucheng established many relationships and sought money from many sources to run Wenhui Daily. Recently, he confessed at a symposium on journalism that he once wanted to use Zhang Bojun's connections to find someone to invest in Wenhui Daily, but it failed because the terms were not agreed upon. He accepted the political investment of the Zhang-Luo Alliance this time, so naturally there was some "profit" to be gained. This style is very dangerous. Third, he opposes the Party's leadership. Xu Zhucheng does not study Marxism but dislikes so-called "dogmatic formalism" and rejects articles by left-wing figures. Xu Zhucheng has consistently excluded Communist Party members within Wenhui Daily. He excluded Comrade Huan Xiang. The "wall demolition experience" he touted demolished two leading Party member cadres. Recently, he transferred Comrade Qin Benli, the Party member deputy editor-in-chief, to an idle position so that he could control the layout himself. This is his way of excluding the Party's leadership in order to engage in bourgeois activities in a big way.
    During this period, Ta Kung Pao also made some mistakes, although the nature of the mistakes is different from Wenhui Daily. We are seriously examining the work of the Ta Kung Pao editorial department. If there are any mistakes, we will confess them to the people and take them as a warning. The serious mistakes made by Wenhui Daily have extremely important and realistic educational significance for us journalists. I personally received a vivid education. I believe the following three lessons have significant realistic meaning:
    First, the newspapers of New China, especially non-Party newspapers, must truly resolve the issue of the direction of running a newspaper. We must adhere to the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao and run a socialist newspaper without the slightest ambiguity.
    Second, socialist newspapers must be led by the Communist Party. The experience of Wenhui Daily clearly tells us that where there is no or weakened leadership of the Communist Party, there is a bourgeois direction.
    Third, intellectuals must continue to reform. Reality tells us that in our country, the class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere will exist for a long time. It is difficult for intellectuals from the old society to abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish a proletarian, communist worldview all at once. In order for intellectuals to make progress in their thinking, in addition to tempering themselves in the practice of work and life, they must also study Marxism-Leninism. Intellectuals must continue to reform, and journalists must especially continue to reform, otherwise, they will not be able to run a socialist newspaper.

### 必须解决办报的路线问题

    必须解决办报的路线问题
    王芸生说：毛主席给我们指示出来的六项政治标准，就是我们的办报标准和办报立场
    在社会主义国家办社会主义的报纸，这原是天经地义的道理，谁知道这问题并没有真正解决。
    毛主席告诉我们：在我国，“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”这次资产阶级右派分子搞起的对党对人民对社会主义的猖狂进攻，就是以阶级斗争的形式出现的。在这场斗争中，章罗联盟的攻势最凶恶，他们不仅占据着两个党的领导地位，还篡夺着两张报纸。章罗联盟在一个期间内篡夺了光明、文汇两报做他们的宣传工具，这个客观存在，就说明着办报的路线问题还没有真正解决。作为一个新闻工作者，对于这个客观存在，我的心情是异常沉重的。
    人民日报曾经指出：“在社会主义国家，报纸是社会主义经济即在公有制基础上的计划经济通过新闻手段的反映，和资本主义国家报纸是无政府状态的和集团竞争的经济通过新闻手段的反映不相同。”我国的新闻工作者还有人未完全懂得这两种报纸的区别，因此，就有个别的报采用资产阶级的办报手段，把报纸当作纯商品性的东西，用带毒素的东西争取读者。近一个时间内的文汇报就是这样的。
    报纸是有充分的政治性的，它和读者之间不仅是几分钱买一张报的关系。在社会主义国家办社会主义的报纸，必须为社会主义服务，这是个路线问题，是不可寸步离开的。一张中华人民共和国的报纸，应该站在什么立场上，拥护什么，反对什么，是必须一清二楚的。毛主席指示给我们的六项政治标准：（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于社会主义的国标团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。这六项标准，就是我们的办报标准，就是我们的办报立场。在储安平担任总编辑时期的光明日报和近一个时间内的文汇报，完全离开了社会主义路线，耍种种花样，来破坏这六项标准。
    章伯钧和罗隆基这两个野心家是知道报纸的重要性的。章伯钧担任着光明日报社长的职务，利用党撤退党员总编辑的机会，与储安平沆瀣一气，就把光明日报搞到资产阶级方向去了。文汇报原是一张很进步的报纸，就因为徐铸成不肯老老实实地在社会主义路线上办社会主义报纸，把文汇报变成章罗同盟的凶恶工具。党和人民支持文汇报复刊，徐铸成却感恩于章罗之门，参与密室策划，派人四处点火，报上天天刮风，向党向人民向社会主义进行猖狂的进攻。罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部，这一个民盟右派系统在文汇报上兴风作浪，徐铸成掌握着文汇报编辑部，是卖了极大力气的。
    徐铸成有多年办报经验，也有聪明才力，在解放八年之后，国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设获得了光辉胜利和重大成就，为什么他倒加入章罗联盟一伙闹资本主义复辟呢？约略分析，徐铸成有三个毛病：一好名。他对于名很计较，他不满意被推为第一届政治协商会议的候补代表，自称“盛世遗民”。其实，谁若是真正为人民效了力，真正为人民做了好事，人民是不会辜负他的。二重利。徐铸成为了办文汇报，多方拉关系弄钱。最近他在新闻工作座谈会上交代，他有一次曾经想通过章伯钧的关系，拉一个人向文汇报投资，因条件未谈好而罢。他这次接受了章罗联盟的政治投资，自然是有所“利”的。这种作风是很危险的。三反对党的领导。徐铸成不学习马克思主义，而讨厌所谓“教条八股”，排斥左派人士的文章。徐铸成在文汇报内一贯排斥共产党员，他排斥过宦乡同志，他所吹嘘的“拆墙经验”，就拆掉了两位党员领导干部，最近他又把党员副总编辑钦本立同志调到闲散位置，由他自己掌握版面。这是他排斥党的领导，以便大闹资产阶级方向。
    在这期间，大公报也犯了一些错误，性质虽与文汇报不同，我们正在认真检查大公报编辑部工作，有错误就向人民做交代，并引以为警惕。文汇报所犯的严重错误，对于我们新闻工作者具有极其重大的现实的教育意义，我个人是受了一场活生生的教育。我认为以下三点教训是有重大的现实的意义的：
    第一、新中国的报纸，尤其是非党报纸，必须真正解决办报的路线问题。遵守毛主席指示的六项政治标准，办社会主义的报纸，丝毫不能含糊。
    第二、办社会主义的报纸，必须由共产党来领导。文汇报的经验清楚地告诉我们，哪里没有了或者削弱了共产党的领导，哪里就闹资产阶级方向。
    第三、知识分子必须继续改造。现实告诉我们，在我国，阶级斗争并没有结束，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争还要长时期地存在，从旧社会来的知识分子是很难一下子就抛弃掉资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级、共产主义的世界观的。知识分子要在思想上有所进步，除了在工作和生活的实践中锻炼自己以外，还必须学习马克思列宁主义。知识分子必须继续改造，新闻工作者尤其要继续改造，否则，他就不能办社会主义的报纸。
