Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, 23rd: The shipping weekly "Pacific Shipper" called for Secretary of State Dulles to resign in an editorial on the 22nd, because he reiterated in a recent speech in San Francisco his refusal to establish trade and cultural relations with China.

The magazine said, "Unfortunately, the United States is saddled with Dulles and the anti-China group in the State Department, which is greatly detrimental to our diplomatic actions in the East and around the world. The only solution seems to be: Mr. Dulles or the group formulating his policies must step down."

According to "Pacific Shipper," Dulles' speech in San Francisco sounded "good" to those who do not understand the situation, but to those who do understand the situation, it was "nonsense." For example, Dulles believes that not trading with China will help China collapse quickly.

    美国一刊物要杜勒斯下台
    指斥他敌视中国的演说是胡说八道
    新华社23日讯　旧金山消息：海运周刊“太平洋装货人”22日在社论中要求国务卿杜勒斯辞职，因为他最近在旧金山发表的演说中重申他拒绝同中国建立贸易和文化关系。
    这家杂志说，“不幸的是，美国为杜勒斯和国务院反华集团的其他人所缠住了，这一点大大有害于我们在东方以及在全世界的外交行动。唯一的解决办法看来是：杜勒斯先生或者为他制订政策的集团必须下台。”
    据“太平洋装货人”说，杜勒斯在旧金山发表的演说在不了解情况的人士听起来“很好”，但是在了解情况的人士听起来就是“胡说八道”了。例如，杜勒斯认为不同中国进行贸易会有助于使中国很快垮台。
