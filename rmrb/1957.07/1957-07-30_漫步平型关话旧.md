    Strolling Around Pingxingguan, Reminiscing About the Past
    Shā Yīn, Guō Jié
    "...On September 25th, our ××× division (115th Division) main force, with mobile, decisive, swift, and secret actions, gave the enemy's most elite Itagaki Division a head-on blow, annihilating more than 3,000 enemies outside Pingxingguan..." This is General Zuo Quan's account of the Pingxingguan victory in his 1939 article, "The Eighth Route Army's Two Years of Perseverance in the War of Resistance Against Japan in North China." This year marks the twentieth anniversary of this great battle. Recently, we paid a brief visit there.
    We departed from the ancient city of Sai Shang—Datong—by car, heading east for five hours, passing through the treacherous Hengshan gorges, crossing mountain ridges thousands of meters above sea level, and entering Tanghe. Following the winding flow of the Tanghe River, we arrived at our destination—Caijiayu Village in Lingqiu County—at four o'clock in the afternoon. That evening, many elderly and young people shared with us numerous moving stories of the Pingxingguan victory.
    It turns out that the Pingxingguan victory brought many benefits to the people of Caijiayu Village. September 1937 was the season for the autumn harvest. That year, the naked oats grew quite well, making it a decent harvest year. However, before people could harvest the ripe crops, the Jin Army (Yan Xishan's troops) stationed in Lingqiu surrendered the city to the Japanese without firing a shot, and looted everywhere in their retreat. This village of more than 260 households, before being bullied by the Japanese invaders, was first ransacked by the retreating Jin Army soldiers. The farmers had to leave their homes, leave the good crops all over the mountains and fields, and flee with their families to the nearby mountains, with tears in their eyes and hatred in their hearts!
    The farmers who fled to the mountains struggled in despair. An old man named Li Hongbin recalled the situation at the time: "At that time, there was truly no hope. Squatting in the gullies, crying, angry, no one had any solutions! Everyone said that no one could save us, but we never even imagined: our saviors would arrive so quickly!" That was the Eighth Route Army marching north to resist Japan. In late September, the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army arrived outside Pingxingguan. Early in the morning of September 25th, they fought a great victory in Qiaogou, more than five miles from Caijiayu. Not a single Japanese soldier, car, or cannon that passed through Caijiayu returned, and it also forced the Japanese invaders attacking Shanxi from Lingqiu to never dare to pass through here again. Only then did the farmers run out of the gullies and hurriedly harvest their crops.
    Young people are willing to listen to past stories, and old people are also willing to talk about the past, and they always like to add their own comments to these past events and compare them with the present situation. In people's memories, the 115th Division, the 359th Brigade, the Training Corps... these people's armies who shared weal and woe with them helped them implement rent and interest reduction, established anti-Japanese regimes, and created a new life that they had never had in their history. Speaking of these things, people always compare the recent three consecutive disaster years with the disaster year of 1939. In the past three years, due to excessive rainfall and hailstorms, Caijiayu's harvest was only 30% to 60%, but every family had enough to eat and wear, and the credit cooperative had more than 2,000 yuan in savings. The state guarantees the necessary rations for each person every year. Last year and this year, more than 4,400 yuan in relief funds were also issued in this village. However, in the great flood of 1939, half of the 260 households in the village fled to Zhangjiakou, and more than 20 families sold their wives and children. Some people starved to death, and those who remained ate oat bran, buckwheat bran, grain husks, and yellow wormwood seeds every day... As soon as spring began, all the elm bark was eaten.
    The next day, we left Caijiayu Village and arrived at Xiaozhai Village.
    With the help of Old Li, the Party branch secretary of Xiaozhai Village, we immediately found Li Tinghuai, who led the Eighth Route Army during the Pingxingguan victory. Li Tinghuai is a good speaker and is very happy to tell us about the Pingxingguan victory he witnessed. At this time, it was raining heavily outside the window, so he began to recall the past starting from "rain": On September 24, 1937, it was also a rainy day. Li Tinghuai met the legendary Red Army on the road while fleeing to the southeast mountain with the rest of the villagers. He was extremely happy and immediately led them to scout the terrain. In the evening, the troops lacked guides when they set off, so he and his two brothers, Li Tingchun and Li Huanwen, each led a route, braving the rain to the battlefield of the great battle—Guangou, one mile away from Xiaozhai. His three brothers were very familiar with the roads and quickly led the troops into the position. The battle finally began at 5:30 a.m. on the 25th. Our entire line of troops launched a fierce attack on the enemy from a commanding position, annihilating more than 3,000 enemies in more than ten consecutive hours of fighting, destroying more than 100 cars and more than 200 carts, and seizing many weapons and ammunition. The folks in the nearby mountain gullies, hearing that we had won a great victory, automatically came out to help the army clean up the battlefield.
    After the Pingxingguan battle, the Japanese invaders were not reconciled to their defeat. In order to protect the offensive route, they installed a stronghold in Xiaozhai. However, the people of Xiaozhai Village, who had experienced the Pingxingguan battle, were already brave enough to fight the enemy. With the help of the Eighth Route Army, they拔除掉了 enemy's stronghold and wiped out all the Japanese invaders in the stronghold. From then on, the people of Xiaozhai Village never stopped their anti-Japanese struggle, and Li Tinghuai also served as the first anti-Japanese village chief of Xiaozhai Village. Li Tinghuai told us: "The enemy killed more than 40 people in our village, but no one revealed the anti-Japanese secrets."
    We made a pilgrimage in Xiaozhai and found that this is a pleasant place: "Green trees surround the village, and green mountains lie outside the valley." Everywhere is the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds, and it is difficult to see that this is the village that was ravaged by the Japanese invaders; and it is also impossible to see that this has been a severely disaster-stricken area for the past three years. People tell us that in the past two years, eight young couples in the village have gotten married, and some people who wandered to the border outside the Great Wall 20 years ago have also returned one after another. In the struggle to fight for their own better lives, the people of Xiaozhai Village, like the great battle 20 years ago, fought a beautiful victory!
    We stayed in Xiaozhai Village for one night, and the next morning, we went to visit the battlefield of the great battle—Qiaogou.
    Qiaogou is indeed a good place to ambush the enemy. The gully is located more than 20 miles outside Pingxingguan, and the gully is about two zhang wide, with towering cliffs on both sides that are dozens of zhang high. We tried to find a place at the bottom of the gully where we could hide without being seen by the two walls, but we completely failed. We walked through the five-mile-long gully and stepped on the Lord's Temple Ridge to overlook the bottom of the gully. Every plant and tree was presented at our feet. No wonder more than 3,000 enemies were completely annihilated at the bottom of the gully 20 years ago!
    Five miles east of Qiaogou is Baiyaitai Village. This village is built on a south-facing hillside, with a small river and a wide pebble river beach in front of the village. The Eighth Route Army, which fought the great battle of Pingxingguan in 1937, rested and ate on this river beach.
    Baiyaitai has 81 households and more than 150 rooms, all of which were built by the government in recent years. The old houses were all burned down by the Japanese invaders after the Pingxingguan battle.
    Here, although there are very few of the more than 60 people who participated in the Pingxingguan battle left, their moving battle stories and their admirable heroic deeds cannot be told in a few days and nights. Under the shade of a tree by a house near the small river, we met Yu Liyou, a 72-year-old farmer who was working. This simple farmer told us endlessly about his past deeds of serving the Pingxingguan battle: he had run 40 or 50 miles of small roads in the dark night to send the wounded; he had also cooked and boiled water for the passing army time and time again. On the second day of the Pingxingguan victory, just as he was sending the wounded, the retreating soldiers of the Japanese invaders rushed into his home and killed his elderly mother and middle-aged wife. But this stubborn farmer just stood in front of the dead relatives for a long time, then gritted his teeth and buried his relatives. Hatred made him resolutely engage in the struggle against the enemy until after the national liberation, he was able to settle down and live his family life again. Last year, he joined the agricultural production cooperative, and the members listed him as a "five-guarantee household." But he is still working, and he worked more than 100 workdays last year. He said with a smile to the reporter: "The past events, it's endless to talk about them now!" We said: "Then talk about the future!" He laughed even harder and said: "The future! Life will be better! But I am a bit old!"
    The Party branch secretary here, Zeng Huai, was also one of the guides for the Pingxingguan battle. Now, he is the oldest Communist Party member in the village. Zhang Shoufu, the deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative, was just 18 years old in the year of the Pingxingguan battle. In that year, he joined the militia. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he cooperated with the troops in anti-Japanese guerrilla activities regardless of his own safety. He said: "We were liberated here from the Pingxingguan battle, but the enemy would not let us settle down. Most of the villagers lived in earthen kilns in the eastern mountains. In recent years, the state has helped us rebuild our homes. People have moved back. In the past, we were never afraid when we went to fight the enemy. Now, there are indeed difficulties in construction. The agricultural cooperative was just established when it encountered a disaster year, but people's enthusiasm is enough! This year, the harvest of naked oats and soybeans is guaranteed. We are striving for a bumper harvest of millet and sorghum. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu this year is twice as much as last year. We want to average 81 jin per mu." We told him that many people are concerned about the lives of the people in Pingxingguan after the disaster. He said cheerfully: "Please tell the people of the whole country that the people living on the Pingxingguan battlefield where they fought the Japanese invaders will not bow their heads in the face of natural disasters!"
    When we left Pingxingguan, the sun was setting in the west, and the soybeans, naked oats, and millet all over the mountains and fields were swaying in the wind, and people's songs and laughter were coming from all around. (New China News Agency Special Dispatch)

    漫步平型关话旧
    莎荫  郭洁
    “……9月25日，我×××师（一一五师）主力即以机动、果敢、迅速、秘密的动作，予敌最精锐的板垣师团以迎头痛击，歼敌三千余于平型关外……”这是1939年左权将军在“坚持华北抗战两年之八路军”一文中关于平型关大战的记载。今年，是这个伟大战役的二十周年了。最近，我们到那里作了一次短暂的访问。
    乘汽车由塞上古城——大同出发，东行五小时，穿过险峻的恒山峡谷，越过拔海数千公尺的山岭，进入了唐河。沿着唐河弯弯曲曲的流水行进，当汽车驶进我们目的地——灵丘县蔡家峪村的时候，已经是下午四点钟了。当晚，就有许多老年人和青年人和我们谈起了平型关大战的许多动人的事迹。
    原来，平型关大捷给蔡家峪村的人民带来了很多好处。1937年9月，正是大秋作物成熟的季节。那年，莜麦长的不坏，可以算作一个好年景。可是，没等人们把成熟的庄稼收割回来，驻守灵丘的晋军（阎锡山的部队），一枪不发地把灵丘城让给了日本人，并且在溃退时到处抢劫。这个二百六十多户人家的村庄，在没有受到日寇欺侮以前，首先遭到了晋军溃兵的洗劫，农民们不得不含着眼泪、怀着仇恨，撇下家园、撇下满山遍野的好庄稼，扶老携幼地到附近大山里去逃命！
    逃到山里的农民们，在绝望中挣扎着。一位叫李红槟的老汉回忆着当年的情形说：“那时候，真是没有个盼望了，蹲在沟里，哭的、气的，谁也没有个法儿！大家都说谁也救不了我们，可是连想也没想到：救命恩人很快就来了！”就是北上抗日的八路军。9月下旬，八路军一一五师到了平型关外，9月25日一清早，便在离蔡家峪五里多的桥沟里打了一个大胜仗，从蔡家峪过去的成群的日本兵、汽车、大炮一个也没有返回来，并且迫使从灵丘进攻山西的日寇，再也不敢从这里走了。这时，农民才从沟里跑出来，急急忙忙地收割了庄稼。
    年轻人愿意听听过去的故事，而老年人也愿意谈谈过去的事，并且总是喜欢对这些往事加上自己的评语，再和眼前的事情比一比。在人们的记忆里，一一五师、三五九旅、教导队……这些和他们休戚与共、患难相处过的人民军队，帮助他们实行了减租减息，成立了抗日政权，创建了他们历史上从来没有过的新生活。讲起这些，人们总是把最近的连续三个灾年和1939年的灾年相比。最近三年，由于雨水过多和雹灾，蔡家峪的年景只有三成到六成，可是家家有吃有穿，信用社存着二千多元存款，国家保证每人每年的必需口粮。去年和今年，还在这个村发出了四千四百多元救济款。可是1939年的大水灾，全村二百六十多户就有一半跑到张家口，二十多户人家卖老婆、卖儿女。有的人饿死了，留下的人每天吃的是莜麦皮、荞麦皮、谷皮和黄蒿籽……刚刚开春，所有的榆树皮就被吃光了。
    第二天，我们离开蔡家峪村，到达小寨村。
    我们在小寨村党的分支书记老李的帮助下，立刻找到了当年为平型关大战的八路军带路的李庭槐。李庭槐是一个善于言谈的人，很乐意给我们谈谈他见到的平型关大战。这时，窗外正是大雨，他就从“雨”开始回述往事：1937年9月24日，也是一个大雨天，李庭槐在和全村人一道往东南山逃跑时，在路上遇到了传说中的红军。他高兴极了，立刻带他们去侦察了地形。晚上，部队出发时缺少向导，他又和他的两个哥哥李庭椿、李焕文三人各领一路，冒雨向大战战场——离小寨一里路的关沟出发了。他们兄弟三人道路很熟，很快便把部队领入了阵地，战斗终于在25日清晨五时半打响了。我全线部队即以居高临下之势向敌人猛击，在连续十多个小时的战斗中，歼灭了三千多个敌人，击毁了一百多辆汽车和二百多辆大车，缴获了许多武器、弹药。附近山沟里的老乡们，听到我们打了大胜仗，都自动出来帮助军队清理战场。
    平型关战斗以后，日寇并不甘心于他们的失败。为了保护进攻路线，他们在小寨安上了据点。但是经历了平型关战斗的小寨村人民，已经敢于和敌人斗争了。他们在八路军的帮助下，拔除了敌人的据点，全歼了据点里的日寇。从那以后，小寨人民就没有停止过抗日斗争，李庭槐也就担任了小寨村的第一任抗日村长。李庭槐告诉我们说：“敌人先后杀了我们村里的四十多个人，可是没有一个人暴露抗日的秘密。”
    我们在小寨作了一次巡礼，发现这是一个景色宜人的好地方：“绿树村边合，青山谷外斜”，到处是花香鸟语，很难看出这就是当年遭过日寇洗劫的村庄；也看不出这里在最近三年内竟是年年遭受灾荒的重灾区。人们告诉我们，在最近两年内，全村有八对青年男女结婚了，一些早在二十年前流浪到口外的人也陆续回来了。小寨村的人民在争取自己美好生活的斗争中，也和二十年前的大战一样，打了一个漂亮的大胜仗！
    我们在小寨村住了一宿，第二天一早，我们就去访问当年大战的战场——桥沟。
    桥沟确是一个伏击敌人的好地方。沟的位置在平型关外二十多里的地方，沟宽约两丈许，两边耸立着高十数丈的悬崖绝壁。我们试图在沟底找到一个可以隐蔽而不致被两壁看见的地方，结果完全失败了。我们穿过五里长沟，踏上老爷庙岭俯视沟底，一草一木都呈现在我们的脚下，无怪二十年前三千多个敌人被全歼灭在沟底！
    离桥沟，东行五里就到了白崖台村。这个村子建设在面南的山坡上，村前有一条小河和一片宽敞的卵石河滩。1937年大战平型关的八路军就曾在这个河滩上休息、吃饭。
    白崖台有八十一户人家，住着一百五十多间房，这都是最近几年政府帮助他们盖起来的，旧房都在平型关大战后被日寇烧毁了。
    在这里，当年六十多个参加了平型关大战的人虽已所剩无几，但是他们的那些动人的战斗故事和那些可歌可泣的英雄事迹，却是几天几夜都说不完的。在临近小河的一间房子边的树荫下，我们遇见了正在劳动的七十二岁的老农民于立有，这个朴素的农民向我们滔滔不绝地叙述了他当年为平型关大战服务的往事：他曾在伸手不见五指的黑夜为送伤员而跑上四五十里小路；也曾为过往的军队三番五次的做饭烧水。就在平型关大捷的第二天，正当他送伤员去的时候，日寇的溃兵冲进家杀害了他年老的母亲和中年的妻子。但是这个倔强的农民只是对着死难的亲属站了许久许久，然后咬着牙埋了亲人。仇恨使他坚决地投入反抗敌人的斗争，直到全国解放以后，他才安心又过他的家庭生活。去年他参加了农业生产合作社，社员们把他列为五保户。可是他还劳动着，去年做了一百多个劳动日。他笑着向记者说：“过去的事，现在提起来说不完！”我们说：“那说说以后的吧！”他笑的更厉害了，说：“以后呀！好过了！不过咱是有些老了！”
    这里的党支部书记曾槐，也是当年大战平型关的向导之一。现在，他是村里最老的共产党员了。农业生产合作社的副社长张守富，平型关大战那年刚刚十八岁，就在那年，他参加了民兵。在八年抗战中，他出生入死地配合部队进行抗日游击活动。他说：“从平型关大战我们这里就解放了，但是敌人不让我们安身，全村人大部住在东山的土窑里，这几年，国家帮助我们重建了家园。人们搬回来了，过去，去打敌人的时候，咱们没有害怕过，现在搞建设，的确有困难，农业社刚刚成立，就遇上灾年，不过，人们的劲头是足啦！今年，莜麦、大豆的收成是有把握了，我们正在争取谷子、高粮丰收，今年每亩地施肥量比去年多了一倍，想一亩地平均打八十一斤”。我们告诉他有许多人们都关心平型关人民灾后的生活，他爽朗地说：“请你们转告全国人民，生活在大战过日寇的平型关战场上的人民不会在天灾面前低头！”
    我们离开平型关时，正是夕阳西下，满山遍野的大豆、莜麦、谷子在迎风摆动，四处传来人们的歌声和笑声。　（新华社专稿）
