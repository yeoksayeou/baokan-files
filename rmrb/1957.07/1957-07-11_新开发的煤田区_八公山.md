    The Newly Developed Coalfield Area - Bagong Mountain
    By Xinhua News Agency reporter Tang Tianzhen
    Bagong Mountain is a new coalfield area in the Huainan coal mines with very rich reserves.
    Four years ago, when I first came here, Bagong Mountain was still an obscure and remote village. Some small farmhouses built of thatch and mud were scattered sparsely across the open fields. Whenever the night was quiet and people were scarce, wolves and wild beasts roamed freely. At that time, even the most imaginative person, except for the designers, could not have imagined that in a few years, pairs of new-type mines would be built here, nor that a modern workers' town would emerge in the midst of these dilapidated thatched houses.
    Recently, I visited this new coalfield area again. As the train entered Bagong Mountain, a picture of an industrial and mining area immediately appeared before my eyes through the train window. Pairs of tall, tower-like mine headframes and newly built workers' villages had submerged some of the original thatched villages. On the wide, bustling roads, workers going to and from work came and went in an endless stream. Trains loaded with coal were transporting coal to various places day and night. At night, thousands of electric lights shone brightly. The roaring of various machines broke through the silence of the night.
    Xiejiaji No. 1 Mine (i.e., Caijiagang Coal Mine) was the first pair of mines built here shortly after liberation. However, the large-scale mine construction project here began after the start of the First Five-Year Plan. On March 10, 1954, two pairs of modern mines designed by our own engineering and technical personnel – Xiejiaji No. 2 Mine and Xiejiaji No. 3 Mine – broke ground. Subsequently, Li Yingzi Nos. 1, 2, and 3 Mines also started construction one after another. Now, Xiejiaji Nos. 2 and 3 Mines and Li Yingzi No. 1 Mine have been put into production one after another; Li Yingzi Nos. 2 and 3 Mines, which are under construction, will also be completed and put into production soon.
    The original Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine also underwent a large-scale overall reconstruction project after liberation. This mine was built in 1946. At that time, bureaucratic capitalists, in order to pursue high profits, disregarded the safety of workers' lives and the loss of national resources. The mine's production and safety equipment were very simple, and the entire mine was dug in a disorderly manner. After liberation, in order to enable this coal-rich mine to produce more coal, an overall reconstruction project began in 1954. After several years of hard work by the workers, the reconstruction project was completed in April this year and put into production. Now, the shaft has been greatly extended, and many new level roadways and coal mining faces have appeared underground; moreover, many mechanical equipment have been added, and many originally heavy manual labors have been replaced by various machines. Due to the completion of the reconstruction project, this year's planned output of this mine has increased by 6.8 times compared with the highest annual output before liberation, making it the largest coal mine in East China.
    Huainan Coal Mine, which had only three mines before liberation, has now developed into eight mines. Due to the construction of these new mines and the reconstruction of old mines, the existing production capacity of Huainan Coal Mine has increased by more than four times compared with the highest annual output before liberation. Huainan Coal Mine has become one of the five major coal mines in the country and is the main supply base for industrial coal in East China.
    In order to meet the needs of the metallurgical industry in East and Central China for coking coal, an automated and mechanized coal preparation plant – Xiejiaji Central Coal Preparation Plant – has started construction here. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of next year. Currently, the construction site is a busy scene everywhere.
    Early one morning in June, I visited Xiejiaji No. 2 Mine. Since this new mine was put into production in July last year, it has produced hundreds of thousands of tons of coal for the country. Under the fighting slogan of "achieving the designed output one year ahead of schedule," the workers improved the mining method, changing from single-wing retreating mining to double-wing retreating mining. Originally, it was necessary to develop five mining areas to ensure that the designed output could be achieved, but now only three mining areas are needed. Due to the change in the development method, some basic construction projects have been reduced accordingly, and the country can save 150 yuan of construction investment this year.
    The tunneling team led by Hu Guanyuan is an outstanding combat unit in this mine. Because they frequently overfulfilled their tunneling tasks, they have won the glorious title of Advanced Tunneling Area for two consecutive quarters. They successfully promoted the advanced operation method of Soviet Lobov tunneling, which increased the average tunneling efficiency by 23.2%. They creatively adopted the four-shift staggered operation method, which made full use of working hours and mechanical equipment, and increased production efficiency by more than 27%.
    This old worker, who had tasted the bitterness of the mine before liberation, is full of hope and confidence in the new life. He said to the reporter with excitement: "The changes in Bagong Mountain are so fast! The development to this point is something I couldn't have dreamed of in the past. The Kuomintang hardly did any construction in those years when they took over Huainan from the Japanese, but in just a few years after liberation, so many new wells have been built. Whoever says our achievements are not great, if they are not speaking against their conscience, then please ask them to come here and take a look!" (Xinhua News Agency special manuscript)

    新开发的煤田区——八公山
    新华社记者　汤天真
    八公山，是淮南煤矿的一个蕴藏量很丰富的新煤田区。
    四年以前，当我第一次到这里来的时候，八公山还是一个默默无闻的偏僻的乡村。一些矮小的由茅草和泥土盖起来的农舍，零落地散布在空旷的田野里。每当夜静人稀时，山狼野兽便肆意横行。当时，除了设计师以外，那怕是最富有想像力的人，也想不到在几年之内，就会有一对对新型矿井在这里建设起来，也想不到在这破落的茅屋中间会出现一个现代化的工人镇。
    最近，我又访问了这个新煤田区。当列车进入八公山的时候，一幅工矿区的图景立刻透过车窗展现在眼前。一对对高大的塔式的矿井井架，一座座新建的工人村，掩没了一些原来的茅屋村落。宽阔热闹的公路上，上下班的工人们来往不绝。一列列满载煤炭的火车，日夜不停地从这里把煤炭运往各地。夜晚，千万盏电灯大放光明。各种机器的轰鸣声，冲破了黑夜的寂静。
    谢家集一矿（即蔡家岗煤矿）是解放后不久在这里建设的第一对矿井。但是，这里大规模的建井工程还是在第一个五年计划开始后进行的。1954年3月10日，我国工程技术人员自己设计的两对现代化矿井——谢家集二矿和谢家集三矿破土开工了。接着李郢孜一号、二号和三号矿井也先后相继开工。现在，谢家集二矿、三矿和李郢孜一矿已经先后投入生产；正在加紧建设的李郢孜二号和三号矿井，不久也将完工投入生产。
    原有的新庄孜煤矿，解放后也进行了大规模的总体改建工程。这个矿开建于1946年，当时的官僚资本家，为了追逐高额的利润，不顾工人生命的安全和国家资源的损失，矿井的生产和安全设备都非常简陋，整个矿井被挖得零乱不堪。解放以后，为了使这个煤藏丰富的矿井生产更多的煤炭，在1954年开始了总体改建工程。经过职工们几年的艰苦劳动，改建工程在今年4月间全部完工并投入了生产。现在，井身大大延深了，井下出现了许多新的水平巷道和采煤工作面；而且增加了许多机械设备，原来许多笨重的体力劳动都由各种机械代替了。由于改建工程的完工，这个矿今年的计划产量比解放前最高的年产量提高了六点八倍，是目前华东最大的一个煤矿。
    解放以前仅有三个矿井的淮南煤矿，现在已经发展到八个矿井了。由于这些新井的建设和老矿井的改建，淮南煤矿现有的生产能力比解放前最高的年产量提高了四倍以上。淮南煤矿已经成为全国五大煤矿之一，是华东地区工业用煤的主要供应地。
    为了满足华东和华中地区冶炼工业对炼焦煤的需要，一座自动化和机械化的选煤厂——谢家集中央选煤厂已在这里开工建设。全部工程预计到明年年底可以完工。目前，工地上，到处是一片繁忙的建设景象。
    6月的一个大清早，我访问了谢家集二矿。这个新的矿井从去年7月投入生产以来，已经为国家生产了数十万吨煤炭。在“提前一年达到设计产量”的战斗号召下，职工们改进了开采方法，将单翼后退回采改为双翼后退回采。原来需要开拓出五个采区才能保证达到设计产量，现在只要有三个采区就可以了。由于开拓方法的改变，相应的减少了一些基本建设的工程项目，今年就可以为国家节省一百五十元的建设投资。
    胡贯元领导的掘进一区，是这个矿井的出色的战斗单位。他们由于经常超额完成掘进任务，连续两个季度获得了先进掘进区的光荣称号。他们成功地推广了苏联洛波夫掘进的先进操作方法，平均使掘进效率提高了23.2％。他们创造性地采用了四班交叉作业法，使工时和机械设备得到充分利用，生产效率提高了27％以上。
    这位曾经饱尝过解放以前矿山苦味的老工人，对新生活充满了希望和信心。他怀着兴奋的心情对记者说：“八公山的变化多快啊！发展到现在这个样子，是过去做梦也想不到的。国民党从日本人手里接管了淮南的那些年，几乎什么建设都没搞，可是解放以后才几年就建设起这么多的新井。谁说我们的成就不大，若不是昧着良心说话，那就请他到这里来看看吧！”（新华社专稿）
