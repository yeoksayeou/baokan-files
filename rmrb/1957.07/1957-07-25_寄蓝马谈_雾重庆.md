	Sending to Lan Ma on "Fog Chongqing"

	Lan Ma:

	I saw "Fog Chongqing," directed by you. While watching the play, I couldn't help but "think back to those years." Life in the mountain city is unforgettable for those who have endured the war years in the rear. Some people couldn't withstand it and became corrupted, but more people persevered. As the play was ending, a young audience member suddenly asked me, "Will Lin Juan Yu still go to Hong Kong?" I said, "No." Why "no"? My answer was so firm, as if I had deeply considered this question. In the winter of 1941, when "Fog Chongqing" was performed in Hong Kong, I played Lin Juan Yu. I've long forgotten whether the design of the character was like this back then. Watching the play today from the audience, the ending, although without any dialogue explaining it, enlightened me to have some "new" views on the characters in the play. Lin Juan Yu has the courage to leave Sha Daqian, to leave the "home" of rotten souls. When she was once bewildered and helpless, she grabbed a reed to save herself, and when she found that this reed would only make her sink further, she resolutely abandoned it. A person who embraces life with enthusiasm and hope, a person who has not lost ultimate faith in life, will certainly have the courage to forge a path for themselves. This is my view of the character Lin Juan Yu, and your performance gave me this view. Although the comrade who played Lin Juan Yu seemed to lack in grasping the character's cheerful, optimistic, and confident side.

	Speaking of the performance, I think the first and second acts achieved the desired effect. Especially the second act, this group of young people who went to the rear for the sake of resisting the war, but had to become cooks and waiters to make a living. Was it for the sake of resisting the war or for the sake of life? Wouldn't life be more meaningful if living wasn't a problem? Life is the touchstone, life is testing everyone. "Fog Chongqing" is not considered Comrade Song Zhi's masterpiece, but from the script, there are still some issues to be studied, but the author has a certain courage to expose that historical era. The second act, in particular, is thought-provoking. I remember performing this play in Chongqing, Chengdu, Hong Kong, and other places. The performers were not from the same troupe, the actors on the same stage were different each time, and the director was not the same person, so the handling methods were naturally different, but in the second act, the effect was almost the same. At that time, the audience would laugh loudly, followed by a silent sigh, but today's performance only leaves the audience with sympathetic laughter, and the laughter no longer has the bittersweet aftertaste. Some of the past years are not worth remembering, but those who have survived can re-watch "Fog Chongqing" and relive the bittersweet past, and they will cherish the happiness of today even more.

	I think Comrade Dong Shumin, who played Tai Li, played the role very successfully. Tai Li is a weakling, a weakling who was squeezed by life in that historical era, and she is worthy of sympathy. Comrade Dong Shumin created this character very vividly. Yuan Murong, who played Zhou Chu, performed very skillfully. I heard that these two comrades have had few opportunities for stage practice over the years, and it is an exciting "discovery" to have achieved such results. It is a truly irreparable loss that such good actors have been idled for so many years!

	There is a character, Wan Shixiu, that you once created and left a deep impression on people. Today, the image on the stage is very different from your original creative intention. Why is that? Is it because the actor comrade is young and finds it difficult to understand this type of character, or is there a distance between this type of character and the actor's style? Yan Xiaopeng's Wan Shixiu seems to have a sense of buffoonery, as if he is playing a bad guy. What kind of bad guy is Wan Shixiu, and how to create the character of Wan Shixiu seems to be a problem that requires more effort.

	I don't like the last two acts, that's a problem with the script. It's a pity that Comrade Zhi has passed away many years since this play was performed. Why didn't you perform his script when he was alive!

	This is the first time you have directed a play, and I forgot to congratulate you first. Old friend, you won't blame me. I hope to see your new play soon, and I hope to see you perform in a new play even more.

    寄蓝马谈“雾重庆”
    凤子蓝马：
    看了你导演的“雾重庆”。一边看戏，一边不由得要“想当年”了。山城生活是曾经在大后方熬过的人忘怀不了的，有的人经不住熬腐蚀了，而更多的人却是熬过来了。戏将结束，一个青年观众突然问我：“林婘妤还会去香港么？”我说：“不。”为什么是不呢？我回答得那么坚决，好像我对这个问题曾经深思熟虑过。1941年冬在香港演出“雾重庆”，我演过林婘妤，当时对这个人物的设计是否如此，早已模糊了。今天在台下看戏，戏的结尾虽然没有任何一句台词说明，然而整个的戏却启发了我对剧中人物有一些“新”的看法。林婘妤有勇气离开沙大千，离开霉烂人的灵魂的“家”，当自己一度彷徨无主的时候随手抓住一根借以救生的苇草，当发现这根苇草只有使得自己更其沉沦的时候又毅然地放弃了它。对生活抱着热情和幻想的人，对生活并未失去最后信心的人，她当然会有勇气为自己闯出一条生路来的。这是我对林婘妤这个人物的看法，我有这个看法，是你们的演出给我的。虽然饰演林婘妤的演员同志，在把握人物开朗、乐观、自信的一面似嫌不足。
    谈到演出，我觉得第一、二幕收到了应有的效果。尤其是第二幕，这一群为了抗战而投到大后方的青年，结果却为了生活不得不掌杓跑堂做起买卖来了，是为了抗战还是为了生活呢？是不是生活不成问题了就能生活得更有意义一点呢？生活就是试金石，生活就在考验着每一个人。“雾重庆”不算是宋之的同志的代表作吧，从剧本来看似还有一些可以研究的问题，但作者对所要暴露的那个历史时代是有一定的魄力的，以第二幕来说，是能引人深思的。我记得在重庆、成都、香港等地演出这个戏，演出者不是一个剧团，同台演员每次都不一样，导演也不是一个人，处理手法当然不一样，而到了第二幕，效果却几乎相同。当时，随着满堂观众大笑后面是无声的太息，而今天的演出只余下观众们同情的笑声，笑声中不再有辛酸的回味了。逝去的年月有些是不值得回忆的，不过，有些熬过来了的人能重看“雾重庆”，能重新回味一下辛酸的往日，也就会更加珍惜幸福的今天了吧。
    我觉得饰苔莉的董淑敏同志演得很成功，苔莉是弱者，是那个历史时代受着生活压榨的弱者，她是值得人同情的。董淑敏同志非常形象地创造了这个人物。周刍的袁慕容演得极老练。听说这两位同志多年来很少舞台实践的机会，能有这样的成绩，是令人兴奋的“发现”。这样好的演员被闲置了这么多年月，这损失真是无法弥补呵！
    有一个人物万世修，你曾经创造过，而且留给人很深的印象，今天出现在舞台上的形象和你原来的创造的意图相距很远，为什么呢？是演员同志较年轻难于体会这一型的人物呢，还是这一型人物和演员的戏路有距离？言小朋同志的万世修，看来有滑稽之感，他好像在演一个坏人。万世修是一个什么样的坏人，如何创造万世修这个人物，似乎是需要花费更多的劳动的问题。
    我不喜欢最后两幕，那是剧本的问题。可惜今天演出此剧，之的同志已去世经年了。为什么不在他活着时演出他的剧本呢！
    你第一次导演戏，我忘了先向你贺喜，老朋友，你不会怪我，希望不久再看到你排的新戏，更希望看你演出的新戏。
