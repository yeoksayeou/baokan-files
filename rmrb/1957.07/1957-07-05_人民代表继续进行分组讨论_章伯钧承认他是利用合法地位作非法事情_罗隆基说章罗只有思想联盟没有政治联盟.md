Xinhua News Agency, July 4th—During group discussions at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress this morning, many groups continued to expose the reactionary words and deeds of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Some groups have recently continued discussions on government work, raising criticisms and suggestions.

Zhang Bojun made another self-criticism in the Anhui Province representative group today. Zhang Bojun talked about his two-faced political life after liberation. He said that he was not loyal to the Communist Party, and towards the work the state gave him and the principles of the Common Program he raised his hand to pass, he was "not single-minded, but double-minded. Praising to their faces, speaking ill behind their backs."

Zhang Bojun said that he had not earnestly taken on the work of the Ministry of Communications, which was politically passive and negligent. During this period, he was also passive in the work of the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, mainly because he was dissatisfied with the democratic parties' acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party.

Zhang Bojun said that in order to achieve his personal political goals, he had a set of ideas and practices. His practice was to promote his set of "views" ranging "from Western democratic politics to old Chinese culture" through lectures, writing articles, hosting dinners, and talking with friends.

Zhang Bojun said that his opposition to socialism and the leadership of the Party was backed by actual actions (he repeated some materials exposed by others). His reactionary activities "can be said to be organized." But he also said, "My activities did not have a secret organization, and my alliance with Luo Longji did not have a specific organization." Rather, he was in the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, "using a legal status to do illegal things." According to him, this was his "organized" and "planned" activity.

After Zhang Bojun's self-criticism, the representatives criticized him for not being honest in acknowledging the Zhang-Luo alliance but not talking about its specific activities. They demanded that he treat the criticisms of the people's representatives with a serious attitude and thoroughly explain to the people. Zhang Bojun finally said that his "entire problem has not been discussed yet."

Luo Longji was the first to request to speak in the Jiangxi group today. He said, "I admit that Zhang Bojun and I have an ideological alliance, because we both have reactionary and backward ideas." However, Luo Longji flatly denied that he had a political alliance with Zhang Bojun. He argued that he did not know the anti-Party conspiracy and action program of this alliance.

The representatives of the Jiangxi group were very dissatisfied with Luo Longji's evasive attitude. They said that it was impossible for Luo Longji to deceive the representatives of the Jiangxi group.

In recent days, the Henan Province representative group has focused on criticizing Zhang Yunchuan's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions. At today's group meeting, Zhang Yunchuan not only failed to reveal any information about the activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance as he had in the past few days, but instead played a trick. He portrayed himself in front of the Henan representatives as an "activist" who fought against the rightists at yesterday's expanded meeting of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. The fact is that at yesterday's meeting of the Central Committee of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Yunchuan did not expose any materials about Zhang Bojun and other rightists' offensive and defensive alliance; on the contrary, when he spoke at the meeting, members of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party pointed at him and criticized him, saying, "You are a rightist." Today, the representatives of Henan Province demanded that Zhang Yunchuan adopt an honest attitude and thoroughly explain the activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance and his own anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions.

In today's and the past few days' group discussions, the representatives put forward some criticisms and suggestions on various aspects of the government's work. Many representatives from the Tianjin, Heilongjiang, and other representative groups demanded that the government severely punish criminals such as theft, murder, rape, and hooliganism. Some representatives cited specific examples to show that the relevant departments had been too lenient in dealing with these criminals in the past, and many criminals continued to commit crimes after being dealt with, disrupting social order. Some representatives from Heilongjiang Province demanded that those criminals who repeatedly refused to be reformed should be severely punished. Yu Aifeng, a representative from Tianjin City and a professor at Tianjin Medical College, suggested that relevant departments should increase the punishment for those who led children to commit crimes.

Many representatives from the Xinjiang, Sichuan, Beijing and other representative groups put forward opinions on overcoming the waste in capital construction. Some representatives from Sichuan, Xinjiang and other representative groups cited examples to show that in the past, non-productive buildings such as theaters, cinemas, residences, and office buildings had excessively high standards and excessive quantities, consuming a relatively large amount of investment. They believed that this situation should be changed in the future, and the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily should be conscientiously implemented. Xiong Shangzhi, a representative from Sichuan Province, said that China has a large population and a weak economic foundation, so funds should be used more rationally and more funds should be used to expand reproduction. He said that we should learn from the spirit of the Soviet people in building a socialist country through hard work in the past. Lü Jianren, secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that in order to overcome the waste in capital construction, the central government should organize forces to inspect and correct the situation in various places, and should first establish a diligent and thrifty style of building the country, starting from Beijing. Liu Dezhen, a representative from Beijing and a model worker in industry, said that he participated in the new construction project of the Xi'an Third Power Plant. The original investment was more than 19 million yuan, but after discussions with the vast number of employees, the raw materials for insulation equipment were changed, saving more than 2 million yuan. If this saving measure can be promoted in power plants across the country, it will accumulate more funds for the country. (Attached picture)

### 人民代表继续进行分组讨论  章伯钧承认他是利用合法地位作非法事情  罗隆基说章罗只有思想联盟没有政治联盟

    人民代表继续进行分组讨论
    章伯钧承认他是利用合法地位作非法事情
    罗隆基说章罗只有思想联盟没有政治联盟
    新华社4日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午的分组讨论中，许多小组继续揭露章罗联盟的反动言行。有一些小组近日来就政府工作继续进行讨论，提出了批评和建议。
    章伯钧今天在安徽省代表小组再一次作了检讨。章伯钧谈到了解放以后他的两面派的政治生活。他说，他对共产党不忠实，对国家给他的工作，对他举手通过的共同纲领的原则，“不是一心一意，而是三心二意。当面捧场，背后说坏话”。
    章伯钧说，他对于交通部的工作未认真担负起来，从政治上看是消极怠工。在这个时期他对民盟、农工民主党的工作也是消极的，主要原因是他对民主党派要接受共产党的领导不满。
    章伯钧说，为了达到个人政治目的，他有一套想法和作法。他的作法是，经常通过讲演、写文章、请客、同朋友谈话等，宣传他的“从西方民主政治，到中国的旧文化”的一套“见解”。
    章伯钧说，他的反社会主义反对党的领导是有实际行动的（他重复了一些别人揭发的材料）。他的反动活动“可以说是有组织的”。但他又说，“我的活动没有秘密组织，我同罗隆基的联盟也没有具体的组织”。而他是在民盟和农工民主党内，“用合法的地位，作不合法的事情”。照他的说法，这就是他的“有组织”“有计划”的活动。
    在章伯钧检讨以后，代表们批评他一面承认章罗联盟，一面又不谈章罗联盟的具体活动，这不是老老实实的态度。要求他以严肃的态度来对待人民代表的批评。彻底向人民交代。章伯钧最后说他的“全部问题还未谈完”。
    罗隆基今天在江西小组第一个要求发言，他说：“我承认我和章伯钧有思想联盟，因为我们两人都有反动的和落后的思想。”但是，罗隆基矢口否认他同章伯钧有政治联盟。他狡赖说他不知道这个联盟的反党阴谋和行动纲领。
    江西小组的代表对罗隆基的这种狡赖态度十分不满。他们说，罗隆基想骗过江西小组代表是不可能的。
    河南省代表小组近几天来集中批判了张云川的反党反社会主义言行。在今天小组会上，张云川不仅和过去几天一样对章罗联盟的活动情况没有丝毫揭露，相反他却耍了一个花招，在河南代表们面前，他把自己描述成一个在昨天中国农工民主党中央执行局扩大会议上向右派作斗争的“积极分子”。事实证明，在昨天农工民主党中央的会议上，张云川并没有揭发章伯钧和其他右派分子攻守同盟的任何材料；相反他在会上发言时，农工民主党的成员们还指着他批评说：“你就是右派分子”。今天，河南省代表要求张云川要采取老实态度，彻底交代章罗联盟的活动情况以及他自己的反党反社会主义言行。
    在今天和过去几天的小组讨论中，代表们就政府各方面的工作提出了一些批评和建议。天津、黑龙江等代表小组不少代表要求政府严厉惩办偷窃、凶杀、强奸、流氓等犯罪分子。有些代表举出具体事例说明有关部门过去对这些犯罪分子的处理过于宽大，许多犯罪分子经过处理后还是照样犯罪，扰乱社会秩序。黑龙江省有的代表要求对那些屡教不改的犯罪分子要严办。天津市代表、天津医学院教授俞霭峰建议有关部门对那些引导孩子犯罪的分子要加重处分。
    新疆、四川、北京等代表小组不少代表对于克服基本建设中的浪费问题提出了意见。四川、新疆等代表小组有些代表都举出事例，说明过去在非生产性建筑方面，如戏院、电影院、住宅、办公楼等，标准过高，数量过多，耗费了较多的投资。他们认为今后应该改变这种情况，认真贯彻勤俭建国的方针。四川省代表熊尚之说，我国人口多、经济基础薄弱，因此应该更合理地使用资金，把资金更多地用在扩大再生产上。他说，我们应当学习苏联人民过去艰苦奋斗建设社会主义国家的精神。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记吕剑人说，为了克服基本建设中的浪费现象，中央应当组织力量到各地检查和纠正，并且首先从北京开始树立起勤俭建国的风气。北京市代表、工业劳动模范刘德珍说，他参加西安第三发电厂的新建工程，原投资一千九百多万元，经广大职工讨论改用了保温设备的原材料等就节约二百多万元。这项节约措施如能在全国发电厂推行，将给国家积累更多的资金。（附图片）
