I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, and Ulanhu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports illustrate the great achievements of our country in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and powerfully expose the conspiracies of the right-wing elements against socialism, against the people's democratic dictatorship, and against the leadership of the Communist Party. These reports have enabled the broad masses of the people to clearly recognize the reactionary stance of the right-wing elements, so that they can no longer use clever rhetoric to deceive the masses. I will focus on three opinions related to Christianity below.

I. Firmly draw a line with the right-wing elements and fight them to the end.

Within the Christian community, we cannot say that the ideas and rhetoric of the right-wing elements have no influence or market. Many of us in the Christian community have been educated in the Anglo-American style; we once had serious pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts; we were once intoxicated by Anglo-American "democracy" and "freedom"; and some of us even yearned for the "middle road." After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the Hungarian incident, the aforementioned ideas, which had been negated, more or less resurfaced among some people.

However, we can say with certainty that the vast majority of Christians are in favor of socialism and support the leadership of the Communist Party. The splendid achievements of the New China in all aspects over the past few years are clearly visible to anyone who has not buried their conscience. Our country also plays an increasingly important role in international affairs. What we enjoy is real democracy and freedom that meets objective needs, not the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy and freedom. We must never allow the Chinese people to return to the enslaved status of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society; we must never allow reactionary rule and imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to be restored in China. We must use all our strength to defend the independence and freedom that our many revolutionary martyrs have won with their blood. In 1956, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity put forward the slogan of "Three Great Witnesses," which is to thoroughly realize the autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese Church; actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland; and actively participate in the movement to defend world peace. These three witnesses are today, and will continue to be, the direction of the efforts of Chinese Christians. We wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the New China; we must resolutely draw a line with the right-wing elements and wage a struggle against the influence they spread within Christianity. We believe that after this movement to expose the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies of the right-wing elements, those Christians who have been deceived by them will wake up, firmly stand on the side of the people, and make greater contributions to the patriotic movement of the Chinese Church and the great socialist construction of the motherland.

II. Continue to be vigilant and smash the destructive activities of imperialism.

In addition to drawing a line with the right-wing elements, we also need to be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism. Imperialism is not reconciled to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity, so they have not relaxed their attacks on us over the past few years. They have consistently distorted the claim that there is no religious freedom in the New China, or that there is only superficial religious freedom. They have fabricated many completely unfounded and ridiculous rumors about the Chinese Church and Chinese Christians. A large number of Anglo-American missionaries who used to work in China remain in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Southeast Asia, studying new strategies for dealing with Chinese Christianity and continuing to spread ideological toxins. In the past year, many publications in religious guise have been sent from Hong Kong to Christians all over the country. These publications distort the Bible, spread negative and pessimistic ideas, promote the "power" of imperialism and the psychological fear of war, and promote the opposition between Christians and the Communist Party.

The purpose of these imperialist conspiracies is not only to continue to control Christianity in the New China and many other countries that were once within their "sphere of influence," but their conspiracies are directly related to their subversive activities. To give an example: In August 1956, the World Council of Churches held a meeting of its Central Committee in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. After the Hungarian incident occurred in October of the same year, a person in charge of the World Council of Churches proudly said in the British Christian publication "British Weekly" on March 28, 1957: "A new era is beginning in the life of the Hungarian Church"; "The meeting of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches held in Hungary in August 1956 paved the way for this new day." When the reactionary elements in the Hungarian Church regained power, this person in charge said in another Christian publication, "Witness," on February 28, 1957: "We already knew what was going to happen in Hungary when we met in Budapest." According to information we have received from within the Hungarian Church, this person in charge contacted the reactionary elements in the Hungarian Church in Budapest several times by long-distance telephone from Geneva during the most tense period of the Hungarian incident, instructing them to quickly take advantage of the opportunity to create a fait accompli in personnel matters and put pro-fascist elements in power. Isn't the matter clear enough? This is not a religious activity, nor is it "concern" for the freedom of the Hungarian Church. It is the naked subversion of the socialist country of Hungary by imperialism through the reactionary elements within the Hungarian Church. Imperialism and their agents attempted to do such a shameless thing in Hungary, and they also attempted to do the same thing in the New China. They failed in Hungary. We Christians in the New China must be doubly vigilant against these conspiracies of imperialism, so that their destructive activities against the New China Church and our motherland can be exposed and smashed at any time.

III. Experience in implementing religious policy.

In the symposiums held by religious affairs departments and the United Front Work Departments in various parts of the country in the past few months, Christians have put forward many opinions on the implementation of religious policy. Most of these opinions are reasonable and are put forward based on actual needs; some are one-sided and put the responsibility entirely on the Party and the government. In addition to reflecting some situations related to the implementation of religious policy at the CPPCC meeting in March of this year, Mr. Wu Yaozong also put forward two specific opinions: First, he hoped that the government would strengthen the propaganda and education work on the implementation of religious policy and at the same time strengthen the manpower of religious affairs departments, especially at the grassroots level; second, he suggested that some supplementary regulations related to the implementation of religious policy be formulated in accordance with Article 88 of the Constitution. These suggestions have been given attention by relevant departments; I hope that the government can consider these two suggestions, and if possible, I hope that they can be implemented quickly and concretely.

In the past two years, I have been to Shandong and Anhui for inspection work, and I have personally experienced that the implementation of religious policy is closely related to the enthusiasm of Christians. On the one hand, the more actively Christians participate in socialist construction, the better the religious policy will be implemented; on the other hand, the better the religious policy is implemented, the higher the enthusiasm of Christians will be. For example, there are about 20 households living in Beigou Village, Chongyang Township, Luoning, Henan, all of whom are Christians. Therefore, since 1954, this village has been renamed "Gospel Village." The believers in the village get along very well. Now they have all joined the agricultural production cooperative. They work together in the fields during the day and sing hymns and worship together in the evening, helping each other and never quarreling. At the labor model conference held in the county in 1956, this village was rated as a model team and received a bag of pesticides and a banner from the government as a reward. This spring, the production in Gospel Village has been even more outstanding. The entire team's wheat fields have been top-dressed twice, some three times, and weeds have been removed in a timely manner, and they have been watered in a timely manner. The wheat seedlings are growing particularly vigorously, and the autumn fields have also been prepared very well. Therefore, in this evaluation, Gospel Village was once again rated as a model team, and the commune gave them a red flag, which they placed in front of the church. Now all the believers in the village are striding forward on the road of socialism. In addition, the Jiangyin District Council of the Church of Christ in China has a total of 5,443 believers, including 86 production labor models, military dependents models, and literacy models, 29 people's representatives, and 234 agricultural cooperative cadres and other administrative cadres. In 1956, the Zhejiang Diocese of the Chinese Sheng Kung Hui had 30 believers elected as people's representatives at all levels, 10 members of the CPPCC at all levels, 262 agricultural and handicraft production cooperative cadres, and 44 people rated as advanced models. According to incomplete statistics from more than 100 churches in Shanghai, there are a total of 1,006 believers with the honorary title of advanced model (not including "five-good" activists). From the above facts, it can be seen that Christians can contribute to the construction of the motherland. It can also be seen from these examples that the implementation of religious policy should be done from two aspects. On the one hand, the responsible persons of our church must constantly improve the national believers' awareness of patriotism and their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction. On the other hand, we also hope that the government will pay better attention to and deal with the still existing problems related to the implementation of religious policy more quickly.

Fellow representatives, in the eight years since liberation, we Christians, like the people of the whole country, have witnessed with our own eyes, heard with our own ears, and personally recognized that our motherland is rapidly changing its face under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the selfless labor of the people of the whole country. To give a happy example: In the past, we could not manufacture automobiles, airplanes, and various complex machines ourselves. Today, we can manufacture them ourselves, and we believe that there will be more and better inventions and creations in the future. In the near future, our motherland can be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Today, the lives of our people are also gradually improving, getting better day by day. All this makes us feel happy and excited. We love our motherland. We must better raise our awareness, open our eyes, distinguish right from wrong, and stand with the people of the whole country to resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end. At the same time, we must further heighten our vigilance and smash the conspiracy of imperialism to use Christianity to sow discord, undermine unity, and undermine construction. We Christians must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, stand in various different positions and work hard to produce and work hard, so that our lovely motherland will be more prosperous and strong, and our great socialist cause will be carried forward.

    有关基督教方面的三点意见
    邓裕志的发言
    我完全同意并且拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告以及李先念、薄一波、乌兰夫三位副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长所做的各项报告。这些报告都说明了我国在社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业上的伟大成就，并且有力地揭露了右派分子反对社会主义、反对人民民主专政、反对共产党领导的阴谋。这些报告使广大人民清楚地认识了右派分子的反动立场，使他们不能再用巧妙的言论来欺骗群众。在下面着重谈谈有关基督教方面的三点意见。
    一、坚决地和右派分子划清界线，斗争到底
    在基督教界里面，我们不能说右派的思想和言论没有影响，没有市场。我们基督教界人士有许多人曾经受过英美式的教育；我们曾经有过严重的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想；我们曾醉醇过英美式的“民主”和“自由”；我们也曾有人向往过“中间路线”。在苏共二十次代表大会以后，特别在匈牙利事件以后，上述这些曾经被否定的思想在有些人中间或多或少的又重新抬头。
    但我们可以肯定的说，绝大多数的基督徒是赞成社会主义的，是拥护共产党的领导的。这几年来新中国建设在各方面的辉煌成就，是任何一个没有把良心湮没的人都能清楚地看见的。我们的国家在国际事务中也起着越来越重要的作用。我们所享有的是真实的符合客观需要的民主和自由，而不是资产阶级的虚伪的民主和自由。我们决不要中国人民回到半封建半殖民地的被奴役的地位；我们决不能允许反动统治和帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国复辟，我们要用尽一切力量来保卫我们许多革命志士用鲜血得来的独立和自由。在一九五六年中国基督教三自爱国运动提出一个“三大见证”的口号，就是彻底实现中国教会的自治、自养、自传；积极参加祖国的社会主义建设事业；积极参加保卫世界和平运动。这三个见证今天是，将来也还是中国基督徒努力的方向。我们衷心地拥护中国共产党对新中国的领导；我们要坚决地同右派分子划清界线，要同他们流传在基督教内的影响展开斗争。我们相信经过这一次揭露右派分子反党、反社会主义阴谋运动以后，那些曾经受他们蒙蔽和欺骗的基督徒一定会醒悟过来，重新站稳人民立场，为中国教会的爱国运动和祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业做出更大的贡献。
    二、继续警惕和粉碎帝国主义的破坏活动
    除了和右派分子划清界线以外，我们还需要警惕帝国主义对我们的阴谋。帝国主义对中国基督教的三自爱国运动是不甘心的，因此这几年来他们一直没有放松对我们的进攻。他们一直歪曲说新中国没有宗教信仰自由，或者说只有表面上的宗教信仰自由。他们制造了许多关于中国教会、关于中国基督教人士的完全没有根据的荒谬可笑的谣言。大批曾经在中国工作过的英美传教士还留在香港、台湾、日本和东南亚，研究他们对付中国基督教的新策略，继续散布思想毒素。在过去一年中曾经有不少的披着宗教外衣的出版物从香港寄到全国各地的基督徒那里，这些出版物歪曲圣经，散布消极悲观思想，宣传帝国主义的“威力”和对战争恐惧的心理，宣传基督徒和共产党的对立。
    帝国主义的这些阴谋不单单是要继续控制新中国和许多其它曾经在他们“势力范围”的国家里面的基督教，他们的阴谋是同他们的颠复活动有着直接的关系的。举一个例：一九五六年八月世界基督教协进会曾经在匈牙利的首都布达佩斯举行了一次中央委员会会议。在同年十月匈牙利事变发生后世界基督教协进会的一个负责人曾经在一九五七年三月二十八日英国基督教刊物“大英周刊”上骄傲地说：“一个新的时代正在匈牙利教会生活里开始”；“一九五六年八月在匈牙利举行的世界基督教协进会中央委员会会议为这个新的日子铺平了道路”。在匈牙利教会里的反动分子重新上台的时候，这个负责人又在一九五七年二月二十八日的另一个基督教刊物“见证”上说：“我们在布达佩斯开会的时候已经知道将要在匈牙利发生的是什么事情”。根据我们从匈牙利教会内部得来的消息，这个负责人在匈牙利事变最紧张的时候曾经几次从日内瓦用长途电话同布达佩斯的匈牙利教会里的反动分子联系，指示他们赶快利用时机在人事上造成既成事实，把倾向法西斯的分子捧上台来。事情还不够清楚吗？这并不是什么宗教活动，并不是对匈牙利教会的自由的“关心”。而是帝国主义赤裸裸地通过匈牙利教会内的反动分子来进行的对匈牙利这个社会主义国家的颠复活动。帝国主义和他们的代理人们企图在匈牙利做这样无耻的事，他们也企图在新中国做同样的事。他们在匈牙利是失败了。我们新中国的基督徒对帝国主义的这些阴谋一定要加倍地提高警惕，使他们对于新中国教会和对于我们祖国的破坏活动都能随时被揭露、被粉碎。
    三、关于贯彻宗教政策的体会
    在过去几个月中在全国各地宗教事务部门和统战部所召开的座谈会中，基督教界人士曾经提出不少关于贯彻宗教政策的意见。这些意见大部分是合理的，是根据实际的需要提出来的；也有一部分是带有片面性，把责任完全推到党和政府的身上的。吴耀宗先生在今年三月的政协会议上除了反映一些与贯彻宗教政策有关的情况外，还提了两点具体的意见：第一希望政府加强关于贯彻宗教政策的宣传教育工作同时加强宗教事务部门的人力，特别在基层方面；第二建议根据宪法第八十八条制定一些与执行宗教政策有关的补充条例。这些建议已经得到有关部门的重视；我希望政府能够考虑这两个建议，如果可能的话，我希望能够迅速的具体的见之于实行。
    在过去二年我曾经到过山东和安徽进行视察工作，我亲自体验到宗教政策的贯彻同基督徒的积极性有着极其密切的关系。一方面基督徒对于社会主义建设工作参加得越积极，宗教政策就一定执行得更好；另一方面宗教政策执行得越好，基督徒的积极性也就越高。例如：河南洛宁崇阳乡北?村住着二十来户人家，他们都是基督徒。因而从一九五四年起，这个村庄就改名为“福音村”，村里的信徒们相处得很好，现在他们都已参加了农业生产合作社，他们白天一起下地劳动生产，晚间一起唱诗礼拜、互相帮助，从不吵架。一九五六年在县召开的劳动模范大会上，这个村被评为模范队，得到政府奖给农药一袋，锦旗一面。今春福音村的生产搞得更出色，全队麦田全部施行了两次追肥，有的经过三次，并且及时除草，适时浇水，麦苗长得特别旺盛，大秋地也整理得很好。因而这次评模中福音村又被评为模范队，社里赠给他们一面红旗，他们将红旗插在教会的前面，现在全村信徒们正在社会主义的道路上大踏步地前进。另外像中华基督教会江阴区会共有信徒五千四百四十三人，其中生产劳动模范、军属模范、扫盲模范八十六人，人民代表二十九人，农业社干部及其他行政干部二百三十四人。中华圣公会浙江教区一九五六年当选为各级人民代表的信徒三十人，各级政协委员十人，农业手工业生产合作社干部二百六十二人，被评为先进模范者四十四人。据上海一百余所教堂不完全的统计，共有先进模范光荣称号的信徒一千零六人（尚未包括“五好”积极分子在内）。从以上这些事实看来，对祖国的建设事业基督徒是可以贡献一份力量的。从这些事例也可以看出贯彻宗教政策应从两方面来做。一方面我们教会的负责人士一定要不断地提高全国信徒爱国主义的认识和参加社会主义建设的热忱，另一方面我们也希望政府对于贯彻宗教政策有关的还存在着的问题加以更好的注意和更迅速的处理。
    诸位代表，解放八年来我们基督徒和全国人民一样，亲眼看见，亲耳听见，并且亲身体认到我们祖国在共产党领导下和全国人民忘我的劳动下，迅速地在改变它的面貌。举一个使我们高兴的例子：过去我们自己不能制造汽车、飞机和各种复杂的机器。今天我们自己都能制造了，并且相信将来还会有更多更好的发明和创造。在不久的将来，我们的祖国就可以由一个落后的农业国变为一个先进的社会主义工业国。今天我们人民的生活也在逐渐提高，一天比一天过得好。这一切都使我们感到幸福，感到兴奋，我们热爱我们的祖国，我们必须要更好地提高觉悟，擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，和全国人民站在一起坚决地与右派分子斗争到底。同时我们更要进一步提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义利用基督教来进行挑拨离间，破坏团结，破坏建设的阴谋。我们基督徒要在共产党领导下，站在各种不同的岗位上努力生产，努力工作，让我们可爱的祖国更加繁荣富强，让我们伟大的社会主义事业发扬光大。
