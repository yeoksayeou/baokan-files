Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 17th: A Japanese farmer, Nozaki Kennosuke, who lives near the US Air Force's Chitose Air Base in Hokkaido, recently notified the Sapporo municipal authorities that he will stage a suicidal sit-in the next time American aircraft from this air base conduct bombing exercises.

According to Kyodo News, labor unions in Hokkaido have decided to send 1,000 workers to support Nozaki when he takes action.

Nozaki said that since 1950, American aircraft at Chitose Air Base have held fifteen exercises every month, with some American aircraft flying only thirty yards above the ground. The deafening roar of the aircraft and the sound of exploding bombs have damaged his wife's nerves, impaired the hearing of other members of his family, and caused the death of some livestock. Even the surviving dairy cows are so frightened by the roar of the aircraft and the sound of exploding bombs that they no longer produce milk. Nozaki said that he has lost a lot of money as a result.

    抗议美空军滥行轰炸演习
    日本一农民要进行静坐斗争
    北海道工会组织将派一千名工人支援
    新华社17日讯  东京消息：住在北海道美军千岁空军基地附近的一位日本农民野崎健之助最近通知札幌市政当局说，这个空军基地上的美国飞机在下次进行轰炸演习的时候，他就要进行自杀性的静坐斗争。
    据共同社报道，北海道的工会组织已经决定在野崎进行斗争时派遣一千名工人去支援他。
    野崎说，自从1950年以来，千岁基地上的美国飞机每个月要举行十五次演习，有时美国飞机在离地面只有三十码的空中飞行。震耳欲聋的飞机吼声和炸弹爆炸声使他的妻子的神经遭到破坏，他的家庭中其他成员的听觉遭到损害，一些家畜死亡了，就是活着的乳牛也被飞机吼声和炸弹爆炸声吓得不再产乳。野崎说，他已经因此而损失了很多钱。
