    Chengdu, July 21 (This newspaper dispatch) – Sichuan in July presents a scene of bountiful harvests. Among the more than 100 million mu of crops, the ripening early rice is being reaped. Waist-high middle rice densely covers the paddies. Cotton plants in full bloom have grown more than ten branches. Corn, sorghum, and sugarcane stand like green walls sheltering the fields. Except for some areas experiencing drought or flooding, most parts of the province have enjoyed favorable weather. Currently, various localities are working intensely on summer harvesting, summer planting, and field management, making continuous efforts to strive for the eighth bumper harvest since liberation.
    Despite the lower temperatures this year, the more than ten million mu of early rice will still achieve an unprecedented harvest due to the widespread adoption of the superior variety "Nante No. 1," and the promotion of advanced techniques such as early planting, dense planting, shallow water irrigation, and heavy application of base fertilizer. In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Luzhou, Yibin, Jiangjin, and Neijiang regions are rushing to plant late rice and have started harvesting early rice when it is only 90% ripe. In Jiangjin Prefecture, the 2.3 million mu of early rice generally yields 500 to 600 jin per mu. Some yields reach over 800 jin. In Rong County, the 5,000 mu of harvested early rice has an average yield of 530 jin per mu, reaching the yield of middle rice last year. Such a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice is a first in Sichuan's history. It once again uses ironclad facts to shatter the conservative view that Sichuan is not suitable for planting double-cropping rice.
    "In spring planting, compete for days; in summer planting, compete for time." While harvesting early rice, various localities are adopting methods such as threshing, plowing, and transplanting rice seedlings simultaneously, as well as using late rice temporary transplanting (false planting) to strive for early planting of late rice. According to the current situation, if the province can complete the plan to rush-plant 8 million mu of late rice, then the province can increase the production of refined grains by 2 billion jin from double-cropping rice alone, compared to last year.
    In order to complete the task of increasing grain production by 3 billion jin and cotton production by 190,000 dan, the province has universally strengthened field management. Rice, cotton, and sugarcane have been weeded two or three times and had supplementary fertilizer applied twice. The once severe insect pests have also been basically eradicated.

    四川农民争取第八个丰收年
    本报成都21日电　7月的四川呈现一片丰收景色。一亿多亩农作物中，黄熟的早稻正开镰收割。齐腰深的中稻茂蓬蓬的密封着稻田。花蕾盛开的棉花抽出了十多枝条。玉米、高粱、甘蔗好似一堵绿墙遮拦着田野。除少数地区有些干旱水涝，全省绝大部分地区风调雨顺。现在各地正紧张进行夏收夏栽和田间管理工作，再接再厉争取解放后的第八次丰收。
    尽管今年气温较低，一千多万亩早稻由于普遍采用良种“南特号”，推行了早栽、密植、浅水灌溉、重施底肥等先进经验，因之仍将获得空前丰收。长江上游的泸州、宜宾、江津、内江地区，为抢时间早栽晚稻，当早稻还只九成黄时就已开始收割。江津专区二百三十万亩早稻，亩产一般五六百斤。有的则达八百斤以上。荣县已收的五千亩早稻，平均亩产五百三十斤，达到去年中稻产量。这样大面积的早稻丰收，在四川历史上还是第一次。它再次用铁的事实打破了四川不适宜播种双季稻的保守观点。
    “春栽争日，夏栽争时”，在收割早稻同时，各地采用边打谷边犁田边栽秧和晚稻寄秧（假植）办法，争取晚稻早栽。按目前情况，全省如能完成抢栽八百万亩晚稻的计划，那么全省仅双季稻一项，就可比去年增产二十亿斤细粮。
    全省为完成增产粮食三十亿斤、棉花十九万担的任务，普遍加强了田间管理。水稻、棉花、甘蔗已锄过两三次草，增施过二次追肥。一度严重的虫害也已基本扑灭。
