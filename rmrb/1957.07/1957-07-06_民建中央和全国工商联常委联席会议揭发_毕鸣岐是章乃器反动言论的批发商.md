Xinhua News Agency, 5th - At a joint meeting of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) held tonight, the ugly activities of bourgeois rightists Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi, who echoed and supported each other in opposing socialism, were initially exposed.

Qiao Weixiong, executive member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported on the struggle against the words and deeds of rightist Bi Mingqi by the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Tianjin branch of the CNDCA. He said that the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Tianjin branch of the CNDCA had established a joint office to wage a struggle against Bi Mingqi's anti-socialist words and deeds. Industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin believe that Bi Mingqi's reactionary statements are exactly the same as Zhang Naiqi's arguments and that he is a wholesale distributor of Zhang Naiqi's capitalism.

How did Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi echo and support each other? Qiao Weixiong pointed out three main aspects:

First, regarding the understanding of the nature of the bourgeoisie: Zhang Naiqi said, "After the 'Five-Anti' campaign and the high tide of the entire industry's joint operation, industrialists and businessmen handed over the means of production. If we still dogmatically emphasize the duality, this will greatly affect the confidence of industrialists and businessmen in self-reform." "At present, the characteristics of all classes in our country have been basically eliminated." Bi Mingqi said, "Private personnel in various places have a sense of inferiority, mainly stemming from class relations."

Second, regarding the relationship between public and private cooperation: Zhang Naiqi said, "In work, it is not appropriate to emphasize the boundaries between the public and private sectors." Bi Mingqi said, "We are all masters, there are no guests, we are all in the socialist realm." After Dong Shaochen, an industrialist and businessman in Tianjin, proposed the opinion of "withdrawing public representatives," he said to Bi Mingqi, "Chairman Bi, I have caused you trouble!" Bi Mingqi supported him, saying, "It doesn't matter."

Third, regarding resisting socialist transformation in the name of helping the Party rectify its work style: Zhang Naiqi said, "Bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." "I am not nostalgic for capitalism, but capitalism also has its good and bad aspects." Bi Mingqi said, "The national bourgeoisie's sense of inferiority is due to class relations. The reason why class relations are not eliminated is due to the sectarian sentiments and work style of Party and government cadres."

Wang Zhizhou, a member of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, cited many examples to illustrate Bi Mingqi's loyal support for Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership actions. He said that Bi Mingqi spread Zhang Naiqi's remarks everywhere in Tianjin. Recently, after both Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi wrote articles and published their fallacies, Bi Mingqi said to Zhang Naiqi when he saw him: "Your article is very well written." Zhang Naiqi also said to Bi Mingqi: "Your article is also very well written, and you should continue to write like this in the future."

Wang Zhizhou said that Bi Mingqi has consistently used the negative aspects of the industrial and commercial circles to resist socialist transformation, and he hates and slanders the Party, the government, and the people. In 1951, he said that the production enterprises affiliated with government agencies at that time were new bureaucratic capital, and he scolded several of us who were close to state-owned companies as "tails" of state-owned companies. Last year, at a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC, he accused the United Front Work Department of "conniving with evil" in treating some members of the industrial and commercial circles who were willing to take the socialist road.

Wang Zhizhou asked Bi Mingqi to conduct a self-criticism, hoping that he would return to the socialist road.

Wang Guangying, deputy director of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, revealed that when Bi Mingqi was hypocritically conducting a self-criticism in Beijing, the Tianjin CNDCA Foreign Trade Branch was planning to attack leftists and activists. This has a lot to do with Bi Mingqi.

Wang Guangying said that when Li Kangnian proposed the suggestion of a fixed interest rate for twenty years, Bi Mingqi said that his suggestion had a positive effect and could motivate people who were not speaking out to speak, which was clearly instigating.

Then, Le Songsheng asked Bi Mingqi in his speech to conduct a self-criticism of his remarks from the depths of his heart.

At tonight's meeting, Chen Shutong also made a speech. He hoped that Bi Mingqi would take this meeting as a good opportunity for a "bath." He also suggested that such meetings be held more often. He said: "This is very beneficial to everyone's self-reform, and it is also beneficial to me." When he said these words, everyone at the meeting applauded in agreement.

Hu Zi'ang reported at the meeting on the criticism of Zhang Naiqi by the Sichuan delegation to the National People's Congress and Zhang Naiqi's repeated resistance to criticism.

Hu Zi'ang is one of the representatives from Sichuan Province to the National People's Congress. He said that Zhang Naiqi is a people's representative elected by the people of Sichuan Province, but he has repeatedly claimed to have important matters and has not attended the meetings of the Sichuan Provincial Delegation. The representatives of Sichuan Province are very angry at his attitude and firmly demanded that he attend the meeting. Only then did he reluctantly attend twice.

Hu Zi'ang said that at the Sichuan Provincial Delegation meeting, the representatives asked him to conduct a self-criticism of his reactionary words and deeds and raised many questions for him to answer. However, Zhang Naiqi believed that the joint instructions issued by the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce were all slandering him and were incorrect. Hu Zi'ang said that the Sichuan Provincial Delegation had invited Li Zhuchen, Wu Dakun, and Jing Shuping to expose Zhang Naiqi's series of reactionary words and deeds in history and after liberation at the delegation meeting. Zhang Naiqi not only did not accept everyone's criticism at the delegation meeting but instead, scolded those who exposed him, with no remorse. The Sichuan representatives are preparing to continue criticizing him next week.

Jing Shuping, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported to the attendees on the struggle against bourgeois rightists by industrial and commercial circles and the China National Democratic Construction Association organizations in various regions. He said that so far, fifteen provinces, seventy cities, and twenty-six counties across the country have launched a struggle against bourgeois rightists. The basic situation is: evil spirits have begun to decline, and righteousness has begun to rise. Many masses with blurred thinking have gradually awakened, those who were wavering have begun to stand firm, the enthusiasm of the backbone elements is being mobilized, and the ranks fighting against rightists are expanding and strengthening day by day. Rightists have begun to be exposed and are beginning to be isolated, and some are still stubbornly resisting. The first round of the anti-rightist struggle has already begun and has achieved initial victories.

He said that at the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle in various places, the focus was first on criticizing Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks, and then further exposing Zhang Naiqi's ugly face and criminal activities before and after liberation, and drawing a clear line with Zhang Naiqi. Various places have expressed great indignation at Zhang Naiqi's stubborn resistance to criticism.

He said that while struggling against Zhang Naiqi, various places have begun to struggle against rightists in their own regions, and many rightists similar to Zhang Naiqi have been exposed in the struggle. Wuhan exposed the rightist Wang Yiming for taking the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style and putting forward ten major dissatisfactions, and wantonly slandering the Party with erroneous words and deeds. Jiangsu Province exposed Qian Sunqing's fallacies of negating the achievements of several political movements after liberation and slandering the national legal system. Tianjin City exposed Bi Mingqi's ugly activities of echoing Zhang Naiqi. He said that the masses are still continuing to struggle against them, demanding that they make thorough explanations and self-criticisms. The masses in various places have expressed that they will never stop until they win a complete victory and demand that the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce provide strong leadership and support.

In order to strengthen the struggle against rightists, a temporary working committee of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was established at today's meeting, and Hu Zi'ang was elected as the director, Sun Qimeng and Huang Jieran as deputy directors, and Sun Xiaocun, Hua Yuqing, Zhang Yuanshan, Zi Yaohua, Xiang Shuxiang, Hu Ziying, Jing Shuping, and Feng Hefa as members.

At the meeting, Sun Xiaocun reported that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association has established a work team for rectification.

    民建中央和全国工商联常委联席会议揭发
    毕鸣岐是章乃器反动言论的批发商
    新华社5日讯　今晚举行的民建中央和全国工商联常委联席会议上，初步地揭露了资产阶级右派分子毕鸣岐和章乃器两人在反社会主义方面一唱一和、相互支持的丑恶活动。
    天津市工商业联合会执行委员乔维熊到会汇报了天津市工商联和民建会对右派分子毕鸣岐的言行展开斗争的情况。他说，天津工商联和民建会已成立联合办公室，对毕鸣岐的反社会主义言行展开了斗争，天津工商业者认为毕鸣岐的反动言论跟章乃器的论调一模一样，是章乃器资本主义的批发商。
    毕鸣岐和章乃器是怎样一唱一和，互相呼应呢？乔维熊指出了三个主要的方面。
    一、关于资产阶级本质的认识方面：章乃器说：“经过‘五反’和全行业合营高潮，工商业者交出了生产资料，如仍教条主义地强调两面性，这对工商业者自我改造的信心有很大影响”“目前我国所有阶级的特性已基本上消灭”。毕鸣岐则说：“各地私方人员存在着自卑感，最主要的是从阶级关系来的。”
    二、关于公私共事关系方面：章乃器说：“在工作中，不宜强调公方与私方的界限。”毕鸣岐说：“同是主人没有客，同在社会主义领域中。”天津工商业者董少臣提出“撤出公方代表”的意见后，对毕鸣岐说：“毕主委，我给你闯下祸来啦！”毕鸣岐支持他说，“没关系。”
    三、关于借帮助党整风为名，抗拒社会主义改造方面：章乃器说：“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”，“我并不是留恋资本主义，但资本主义也有好有坏。”毕鸣岐说，“民族资产阶级的自卑感是由于阶级的关系，不取消阶级关系是由于党政干部的宗派主义的情绪和作风。”
    民建天津市委和天津市工商联委员王芷洲，举出许多事例，说明毕鸣岐忠心支持章乃器的反社会主义和反对党的领导的行动。他说，毕鸣岐在天津到处宣传章乃器的言论。最近章乃器和毕鸣岐都写文章发表了他们的谬论后，毕鸣岐见到章乃器时对他说：“你的文章写得很好”。章乃器也对毕鸣岐说：“你的文章也写得很好，以后还照样写下去。”
    王芷洲说，毕鸣岐还一贯利用工商界消极一面抗拒社会主义改造，并且仇视和诬蔑党、政府和人民。他在1951年曾经说当时政府机关附属的生产企业是新官僚资本，曾经骂我们几个靠拢国营公司的人是国营公司的“尾巴”。去年他在中共天津市委统战部召开的座谈会上，指责统战部对待一部分愿意走社会主义道路的工商界人士“姑息养奸”。
    王芷洲要求毕鸣岐进行检查，希望他回头走社会主义道路。
    天津市工商联副主任委员王光英揭露毕鸣岐在北京假惺惺地作检查的时候，天津市民建外贸支部却在计划打击左派，打击积极分子。这同毕鸣岐大有关系。
    王光英说，李康年提出定息二十年的建议，毕鸣岐说他的建议有积极作用，可以带动不发言的人发言，这是明明白白地在进行煽动。
    接着，乐松生在发言中要求毕鸣岐对自己的言论从心的深处作检查。
    在今晚的会议上，陈叔通也作了发言。他希望毕鸣岐把这次会作为一个“洗澡”的好机会。他还建议这样的会多开几次。他说：“这对每个人的自我改造很有好处，对我也有好处。”他讲这些话的时候，到会的人都鼓掌表示赞成。
    胡子昂在会上报告了全国人民代表大会四川代表小组批判章乃器以及章乃器多方抗拒批评的情形。
    胡子昂是出席全国人民代表大会的四川省代表之一。他说，章乃器是四川省人民选举的人民代表，可是他屡次推说有重要事务，不出席四川省代表小组的会议，四川省代表对他的这种态度非常愤慨，坚决要他参加会议，他才勉强地参加了两次。
    胡子昂说，在四川省代表小组会上，代表们要求他就他的反动言行进行检查，并且提出许多问题要他作答，而章乃器反而认为民建和工商联发布的联合指示统统是诬蔑他的，是不正确的。胡子昂说，四川省代表小组曾经邀请李烛尘、吴大琨、经叔平在小组会上揭露了章乃器历史上和解放以后一连串的反动言行。章乃器在小组会上对大家的批评不仅不接受，反而谩骂揭发他的人，毫无悔罪之心。四川省代表准备下星期继续对他展开批判。
    全国工商联副秘书长经叔平向到会人员汇报了各地工商界和民建组织对资产阶级右派分子进行斗争的情况。他说，到目前为止，全国已有十五个省七十个市二十六个县开展了反对资产阶级右派的斗争。基本情况是：邪气开始下降，正气开始抬头。不少思想模糊的群众逐渐觉悟过来，摇摇摆摆的也开始站稳了立场，骨干分子的积极性正在调动起来，同右派分子作斗争的队伍正在日益扩大和加强；右派分子开始被揭露，开始处于孤立地位，有的仍在顽抗中。反右派斗争第一回合已经展开，并且已经取得初步胜利。
    他说，各地反右派斗争开始时，首先是集中批判章乃器的反动言论，然后进一步地揭露章乃器在解放前后的丑恶面貌和罪恶活动，并与章乃器划清界限。各地对章乃器的顽强抗拒批评的态度表示非常愤慨。
    他说，各地在斗争章乃器的同时，已开始对本地区的右派分子进行斗争，从斗争中揭发不少类似章乃器的右派分子。武汉揭露了右派分子王一鸣利用帮助党整风的机会提出了十大不满，对党大肆诬蔑的错误言行；江苏省揭露了钱孙卿否定解放后几次政治运动的成绩，诬蔑国家法制等谬论；天津市揭露毕鸣岐与章乃器一唱一和的丑恶活动。他说，现在群众还在继续向他们斗争，要他们作彻底交代和检讨。各地群众都表示不获全胜决不收兵，并要求民建中央和全国工商联给予有力的领导和支持。
    为了加强反右派分子斗争，今天会上成立了民建中央常委、全国工商联临时工作委员会，并推选胡子昂为主任，孙起孟、黄玠然为副主任，孙晓村、华煜卿、章元善、资耀华、项叔翔、胡子婴、经叔平、冯和法等八人为委员。
    会上孙晓村报告民建中央常委会已经成立一个整风工作组。
