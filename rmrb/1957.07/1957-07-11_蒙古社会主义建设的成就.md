    The Mongolian people's revolution has been victorious for thirty-six years. Over the past thirty-six years, Mongolia has traversed the capitalist stage of development from a feudal economy with primitive animal husbandry, and is now advancing victoriously along the socialist road. After successfully completing the First Five-Year Plan from 1948 to 1952, the Mongolian people immediately implemented the Second Five-Year Plan starting in 1953. Currently, the Mongolian people are working hard to complete the tasks of the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan. Starting next year, the Mongolian people will strive to implement a new Three-Year Plan.

    At present, the socialist structure of the Mongolian People's Republic completely controls state-owned industry, mechanized transportation, finance and credit, foreign trade, and domestic wholesale trade.

    Animal husbandry, the foundation of the national economy, had already organized more than 600 cooperatives by the end of last year, accounting for more than 22% of the total number of herding households. After the completion of the Three-Year Plan, 50% of the herdsmen will have joined the herding cooperatives, and 150 to 200 herding cooperatives will have settled down. In the past year, Mongolia’s livestock increased by more than 1.3 million head, and the country now has a total of over 20 million head of livestock, averaging more than twenty head per person nationwide. Animal husbandry has begun to be mechanized, and many machine livestock stations are being established.

    Agriculture will play a major role in the continued development of animal husbandry. The Party and the government pay great attention to the development of agriculture, and in the next three years, the planting area of agriculture will be more than doubled than it is now. This year, more than twenty state-owned farms will reclaim 17,000 hectares of wasteland and sow 49,000 hectares of grain and vegetables.

    The Republic’s industry has been established and has become the leading socialist component of the national economy. The ranks of the working class are constantly expanding, and the number of workers now accounts for 27.4% of the total population. Heavy industries such as mining, coal mining, petroleum, and electricity are constantly developing, and dozens of large factories and enterprises with modern equipment have been established. Light industries such as tanneries, furniture factories, and wool washing factories are also continuing to expand. Each of the seventeen provinces in the country has food processing factories, and there are more than 270 small cream factories throughout the country. Currently, the annual export of cream can be exchanged for more than 30,000 tons of flour. In 1956, the products of cooperative industries increased by 3.4 times compared to 1931.

    The transportation industry has undergone unprecedented development. A 1,100-kilometer railway trunk line has linked three brotherly countries—the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China. The border regions of the country have telephone, telegraph, and radio connections with the capital.

    Mongolia’s cultural and educational undertakings are also very developed. The country has implemented a universal compulsory primary education system for school-age children, and a universal seven-year compulsory education system has been implemented in some large cities, and many adult night schools have also been established. Last autumn, Mongolia had 432 middle and primary schools, 15 technical vocational schools, and 4 institutions of higher learning. Illiteracy has been eliminated, and libraries and reading rooms are found everywhere.

    People's living standards are constantly improving with the development of the national economy and cultural undertakings. In the last four years alone, workers’ wages have increased by 36.8%. Trade unions have established many sanatoriums and rest homes, and workers with twenty years of service can receive pensions. The Fourth Session of the Second Great People's Hural decided to reduce the working hours of employees by two hours on Saturdays and the day before certain holidays, starting from April 20th of this year.

    蒙古社会主义建设的成就
    蒙古人民革命胜利已经三十六年了。三十六年来，蒙古已经从带有原始性的畜牧业的封建经济，越过了资本主义发展阶段，目前正沿着社会主义道路胜利地前进。从1948年至1952年，蒙古人民在胜利地完成了第一个五年计划以后，紧接着从1953年开始又实行了第二个五年计划。目前，蒙古人民正在为完成第二个五年计划的最后一年的任务而努力着。从明年开始，蒙古人民又将为实行新的三年计划而奋斗。
    现在，蒙古人民共和国社会主义结构完全控制了国营工业、机械化运输业、财政和信贷、对外贸易和对内批发贸易等部门。
    作为国民经济基础的畜牧业在去年年底就已经组织了六百多个合作社，占全体牧户总数的22％以上。三年计划完成以后，将有50％的牧民加入牧业合作社，并且使一百五十至二百个牧业合作社定居下来。在去年一年内，蒙古纯增加的牲畜达一百三十多万头，现在国内共有牲畜二千几百万头，按全国平均人口计算，平均每人可得二十几头。畜牧业已开始实行机械化，许多机器畜牧站正在建立。
    在继续发展畜牧业方面，农业将起着很大的作用。党和政府对于农业的发展予以很大的注意，在今后三年内，要使农业的播种面积比现在增加一倍多。今年二十几个国营农场要开垦一万七千公顷荒地，播种四万九千公顷的谷物和蔬菜。
    共和国的工业已经建立起来了，并成为国民经济中社会主义成分的主导部门。工人阶级队伍不断地扩大，工人的人数已占全体居民总数的27.4％。采矿、采煤、石油、电气等重工业都在不断地发展，几十座拥有现代化设备的大工厂企业已经建立起来了。制革厂、家具厂和洗毛厂等轻工业亦正在继续扩大。国内的十七个省都有了食品加工工厂，全国各地共有二百七十多个小型奶油工厂。现在，每年输出的奶油可换回三万多吨面粉。1956年合作社工业的产品比1931年增加了三点四倍。
    交通运输业得到了空前的发展，全长一千一百公里的铁路干线，已经把三个兄弟国家——苏、蒙、中联结起来了。国内的边沿地区已经与首都有了电话、电报和无线电的联系。
    蒙古的文化教育事业亦很发达。全国已经实行了学龄儿童普及初等义务教育制，在一些大的城市已经实行了普及七年制义务教育，并且还设立了许多成人夜中学。去年秋季，蒙古国内已有四百三十二所中、小学，十五所技术专科学校和四所高等学校。文盲已经消灭了，图书馆和阅览室遍及各地。
    人民的生活随着国民经济和文化事业的发展在不断地提高。仅在最近四年内，工人的工资就增长了36.8％，工会设立了许多疗养所和休养所，有二十年工龄的工人可以得到养老金。第二届大人民呼拉尔第四次会议决定，从今年4月20日起，已经把职工星期六和某些节日前一天的工作时间减少了两个小时。　　　（弼）（附图片）
