    The Gambler's "Courage"
    Yuan Xianlu
    Some supporters of the "European Movement" are praising France's "courageous action." Because, after a week of intense debate, the French National Assembly approved the West European "Common Market" treaty on July 9 by a vote of 342 to 239.
    What is courage? People can have completely different interpretations. A gambler staking all of his property on the gambling table, in the eyes of some, can also be considered "courageous." France's ratification of the West European "Common Market" treaty, if it can be considered "courageous," is probably in this sense. The famous French bourgeois political commentator Duverger said that France's acceptance of the Common Market "has the nature of gambling." Even Prime Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury admitted that France's participation in the "Common Market" was "taking a great risk," which is to say, gambling. But the serious thing is that in this gamble, the stake is France's national interests, and the possibility of winning is very small.
    Among the six member states of the "Common Market," France's main opponent is West Germany. Now the cards have not yet been revealed, but the outcome is not difficult to predict. Because, what determines the outcome of this gamble is not anything else, but the contrast between the economic strengths of the opponents.
    France's industrial equipment is relatively outdated, and the cost of its products is generally 10% to 15% higher than that of West Germany. For a long time, despite the various measures taken by France to encourage exports and restrict imports, its foreign trade has still frequently been in deficit, and the situation has been particularly serious recently. Foreign exchange is extremely scarce, and it is heavily indebted. The gold reserves of the Bank of France have already been used, and the position of the franc is in a precarious state. With such an economy, once trade is "liberalized" and capital flows freely, the consequences under the pressure of the powerful West German monopoly capital are conceivable.
    So, why is France willing to take the risk? A somewhat comforting explanation is what Bourgès-Maunoury said in his speech requesting authorization from the National Assembly to become Prime Minister: Within a year and a half, "France must have restored the stability of its currency and a highly competitive economy, which is sufficient to cope with the initial stage of the Common Market without danger and without silence."
    However, just by looking at the actual situation of the French economy in the past year and a half, it can be seen that this explanation is nothing but self-deception. Foreign exchange losses totaled $1.8 billion. Foreign exchange reserves have been reduced to less than half of the publicly recognized minimum safe level. The fiscal deficit far exceeded one trillion francs. Inflation has reached a serious level. This is the record of the past year and a half. It is not that the Mollet government did not try its best, but because the chronic illness of the French economy was deep-seated. Some of the economic measures taken by Bourgès-Maunoury after taking office show that he has not escaped the Mollet government's predicament, and the Algerian war must be intensified. How can one imagine that in the next year and a half, the chronic diseases of the French economy will suddenly be cured?
    But then again. The establishment of the "Common Market" is still profitable for some large French monopoly capital groups. For example: the free flow of labor between member states facilitates them to lower workers' wages and social welfare; the intensification of economic competition facilitates them to accelerate the merger of small and medium-sized enterprises; they can also use foreign funds to develop African colonies, and so on. Blinded by greed, they do not hesitate to stake national interests as a last resort. Even within the French bourgeoisie, some people are seriously uneasy about such a gamble. The French magazine "Perspectives" reminded people with concern to recall Hitler's plan to destroy French industry and annex French territory when commenting on the "Common Market" treaty. This is not an unfounded worry. Have those French gentlemen who gamble with French national interests ever thought of the Laval path?

    赌徒的“勇敢”
    袁先禄
    一些“欧洲运动”的支持者正在赞扬法国的“勇敢行动”。因为，法国国民议会经过一星期的激烈辩论以后，已经在7月9日以三百四十二票对二百三十九票批准了西欧“共同市场”条约。
    什么叫做勇敢？人们可以有完全不同的解释。一个赌徒自己的全部财产在赌桌上孤注一掷，在某些人看来这也算得是“勇敢”的。法国批准西欧“共同市场”条约，如果算得是“勇敢”，大概就是这种意义上的。法国著名的资产阶级政论家杜维歇就说法国接受共同市场“带有赌博的性质”。甚至布歇—莫努里总理也承认，法国参加“共同市场”是“冒着很大危险的”，也就是赌博的意思。可是严重的是在这场赌博里，赌注是法国的民族利益，而赌赢的可能甚小。
    在“共同市场”的六个成员国中，作为法国主要对手的是西德。现在牌还没有开，但是输赢已经不难预断了。因为，决定这场赌博的输赢的不是别的，而是对手之间经济力量的对比。
    法国工业设备比较陈旧，产品成本一般要比西德高10％到15％。长期以来，尽管法国采取了各种鼓励出口和限制进口的措施，对外贸易仍然经常逆差，最近情况更是十分严重。外汇奇缺，负债累累。法兰西银行的黄金储备已经动用，法郎的地位在风雨飘摇之中。如此经济，一旦贸易“自由化”，资本自由流通，在实力雄厚的西德垄断资本的压力下，其结果是可想而知的。
    那么，法国为什么又甘冒危险呢？有一种聊以自慰的解释就是布歇—莫努里在要求国民议会授权他当总理的那次演说中所说的：在一年半以内，“法国就一定已经恢复了它的货币的稳固性和一种竞争力量很强的经济，这种经济足以毫无危险地、毫不沉默地应付共同市场的初期”。
    但是，只要看看过去一年半时期里法国经济的实际情况，就可以看出，这种解释不过是自欺欺人之谈而已。外汇亏空共达十八亿美元。外汇储备减少到不足公认最低安全水平的一半。财政赤字远超过一万亿法郎。通货膨胀到了严重的程度。这就是这一年半的纪录。并不是摩勒政府没有想尽办法，而是因为法国经济的积疾已深。布歇—莫努里上台后的一些经济措施表明，他并没有脱出摩勒政府的窝臼，而阿尔及利亚战争还要加紧进行。如何能设想，在今后的一年半时间里面，法国经济的痼疾就会霍然而愈？
    可是话要说回来。“共同市场”的建立对法国一些大垄断资本集团说来还是有利可图的。例如：成员国之间劳动力的自由流动，便于他们降低工人的工资和社会福利；经济竞争的加剧，便于他们加速并吞中小企业；还可以借外国的资金来开发非洲的殖民地，等等。他们财迷心窍，就不惜把民族利益作孤注一掷。甚至在法国资产阶级内部，对于这样一场赌博，也有人严重地感到不安。法国“展望”周刊在评论“共同市场”条约时，就忧心忡忡地提醒人们回忆一下过去希特勒提出的摧毁法国工业和并吞法国领土的计划。这并不是杞人忧天的想法。拿法国民族利益进行赌博的那些法国绅士们也曾想到赖伐尔的道路么？
