    Ambitious People Should Not Forget
    The Working Class Will Raise the Hammer
    The rightists attempt to portray the contradiction between the teeth and tongue within the people as an antagonistic contradiction, insisting that the teeth must be knocked out and the tongue cut off to resolve it. This is a deliberate attempt to undermine the socialist system. We workers and the Communist Party are of one life and one heart, as inseparable as teeth and tongue. If anyone attempts to knock out our teeth or cut off our tongue, to oppose socialism, our working class will raise the hammer and fight them.
    Zhu Shunyu's Speech
    I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo. We workers are incredibly pleased with the great achievements of 1956, and we have complete confidence in overfulfilling the tasks of the final year of the First Five-Year Plan. In particular, studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" during the preparatory meeting has given me unlimited courage and strength to build our great socialist motherland.
    Of course, I am not saying that there are no shortcomings in our country's construction work. Today, I would like to raise a few points of opinion on the government's work.
    First, in the renovation and construction of our factory, there is a widespread mentality from top to bottom that socialist construction must be good in every way, and it doesn't matter if a little more money is spent. Especially on non-productive buildings, the standards are too high, causing some waste. I think Beijing's construction also has a similar flavor. I also feel that the leaders of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the relevant bureaus, which lead our factory, are not working deeply enough at the grassroots level and underestimate the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and engineering technicians. For example, according to the Shanghai Turbine Factory's technical equipment and production capacity, with only slight measures and some modifications to the drawings, it would be possible to manufacture 50,000-kilowatt turbines. Our factory's Chief Engineer Yin has actively suggested this, and the leaders of the Fourth Bureau have indicated that they can consider it, but the specific support is not enough. Furthermore, there are also shortcomings in the balance of production and sales of turbine generator equipment. For example, the Shanghai Turbine Factory has an annual production capacity of 500,000 kilowatts for medium and small turbines, but this year's production plan only has tasks for 143,500 kilowatts. Our factory feels that it is not working at full capacity. According to the preliminary opinions of the Second Five-Year Plan, domestic orders for turbines account for less than half of the total need. We and the Harbin Turbine Factory could supply several hundred thousand more kilowatts without any problems. Given the current shortage of foreign exchange in the country, more should be manufactured domestically. Is the Ministry of Electric Power somewhat uneasy about domestic turbine manufacturing, since they are placing more orders abroad? Do they think that domestic turbines may have technical problems or are too expensive? Our bureau and factory believe that the technology can currently be guaranteed, and the cost can be gradually reduced. The cost of our 6,000-kilowatt turbines is already lower than the price of imported 6,000-kilowatt turbines. I hope the Ministry of Electric Power will bring back more foreign orders so that our factory will not have to draw workers to study. Of course, I am not here to solicit business for our factory at the People's Congress; I am mainly reflecting the unreasonable situation of the plan.
    Second, the various bureaus under the First Ministry of Machine Building do not communicate and cooperate well enough with each other, causing some waste. For example, according to the Shanghai Turbine Factory's steelmaking capacity, we can increase production by about 400 tons of steel this year, but because the Shanghai First Ministry of Machine Building Fourth Bureau of Machine Building Industry's factories have enough steel, they told our factory not to increase production. However, other bureaus under the same ministry, whose factories are short of steel, have to buy it from other places, causing waste of manpower and resources. For example, on October 11th of last year, the Fourth Bureau sent us a notice asking our factory to recruit 300 workers and apprentices in the second half of the year. Our factory's labor section found this very strange. In fact, our factory's First Five-Year Plan tasks had already been completed in May of last year (I also talked about this at the last People's Congress), and the tasks for the Second Five-Year Plan had not yet been assigned. At that time, the production tasks were already insufficient, and the number of people was already too high. The bureau's planning unit knew this situation, but the bureau's personnel unit still wanted us to increase the number of people. Why did this happen? Also, the ministry and bureau's grassroots organizations are overlapping, documents are passed back and forth, and procedures are complicated, causing many inconveniences to work. For example, for some things that the factory director can solve, in order to be responsible at every level and reviewed everywhere, it takes several months for the superiors to approve, causing the factory to wait for documents and affecting production. I hope the higher-level organizations will delegate the powers that can be delegated to the grassroots level to make the work practical.
    Third, I also have some opinions on the leadership's handling of apprentices. Of course, a small number of apprentices are influenced by bourgeois ideology, do not study diligently, do not respect the master workers, demand better treatment, and talk about enjoying life, but I think the leadership is also responsible for not doing a good job of ideological education. For example, when mobilizing apprentices to learn technology, they do not educate them from a political and ideological standpoint but love to say that after learning for a certain amount of time, they can be promoted to a certain grade of technician, etc., which is not actually possible. Many apprentices reflect: "We originally thought it was glorious to learn to be a skilled worker, and we knew it was difficult to learn technology. After listening to the mobilization report, we thought it was so easy." Doesn't this encourage the apprentices to only talk about promotion and not focus on learning technology when the time comes? Although this practice has already been corrected, it has left some bad consequences. At the same time, there are also shortcomings in newspaper propaganda. For example, some newspapers published news that a certain factory trained a third-grade welder in 27 days, which is also unrealistic. I hope the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders will continue to strengthen the ideological education of apprentices, educate the younger generation of workers, and earnestly implement the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift.
    The problems I have raised above are problems within the people, problems in our country's progress, and problems caused by our lack of experience in socialist construction. They can be completely solved through the formula of unity-criticism-unity. If someone sees some shortcomings and thinks that our country is completely dark, that the Communist Party is no good, and that socialism is bad, this is extremely absurd. They say that this is not good and that is not good, only they are good. They attempt to portray the contradiction between the teeth and tongue within the people as an antagonistic contradiction, insisting that the teeth must be knocked out and the tongue cut off to resolve the contradiction. Isn't this a deliberate attempt to undermine the socialist system?
    I think how you treat contradictions among the people depends on what standpoint you are looking at it from. For example, is people's lives better or worse now? We workers think it is much better than before. Before liberation, we workers couldn't afford a decent piece of clothing or a decent house and were often worried about unemployment when working. Before liberation, I was unemployed and pedaled a rickshaw. The money I earned was split four-six with the petty capitalist who rented out the rickshaw. I couldn't even fill my stomach even if I worked myself to death. At that time, my wife was pregnant and wanted to eat white rice, but how could we afford white rice without money? We had to borrow five dou of rice from my aunt's family and cook rice with broad beans. She ate less broad beans and more rice, and I ate most of the broad beans. I went out to pedal the rickshaw to buy some bran and make bran cakes to eat. Who cared about our lives at that time? Now our wages are higher than in the past, we have sick leave pay when we are sick, we have retirement pay when we are old, and someone takes care of our funeral arrangements when we die. In the workshop, we have fan cooling equipment in the hot weather and stoves in the winter. We think life is much better than before, but some rightists pretend to speak for us, saying that workers' lives have not improved. We didn't hear them say that workers were suffering before liberation. Why are they complaining on behalf of the workers now? To put it bluntly, it stinks. It turns out that they are trying to provoke the relationship between the working masses and the Party and the government and are complaining for the capitalists. They hang up a sheep's head but sell dog meat. If you stand on the capitalists' standpoint today, some of them will feel that they are not as good as before. Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at Renmin University, is a good representative of these people. He said that if you can't buy pork, you can't say that people's lives have improved. Didn't you have to queue up to buy pork in the past? Who could often afford to eat meat? Do I need to say more?
    Of course, I am not saying that the workers' living standards are already very high today. Our country is still very poor, and people's lives can only be slowly improved with the development of production, and cannot be improved overnight. Some people complain that there are no swimming pools, skating rinks, or dance halls in the factories. These demands are unrealistic at present. And even in the future, not every factory will have a swimming pool, skating rink, or dance hall. This principle is also very clear.
    For example, some workers make trouble. We think this is very bad, and the country and the people suffer losses. But some ambitious people think that making trouble is very good, and even advocate going to the grassroots level to let loose and stir up trouble, inciting the masses to make trouble, trying to create opposition between the masses and the government, so that they can take advantage of it. We workers will never be fooled. We workers and our Party and our government are one family. If we have opinions, we will raise them to the Party and the government, and we will never allow ambitious people to come among us to seek political capital.
    The rightists do not want the leadership of the Party and deny the achievements of our socialist construction. No one with patriotism can agree to this. Let's not talk about the achievements of our country being able to manufacture cars and jet planes. Take our turbine factory as an example. In the past, China had to send turbines abroad for repairs. Now we can not only repair turbines but also manufacture 6,000, 12,000, and 25,000-kilowatt turbines. We are also preparing to manufacture large 50,000-kilowatt turbines. Our factory's original design capacity was to produce 275,000 kilowatts of turbines per year, and now it can reach 500,000 kilowatts. The largest turbine that could be manufactured during design was 12,000 kilowatts, and now we are preparing to manufacture 50,000 kilowatts. May I ask, isn't this the result of the Communist Party's leadership? Isn't this the achievement of socialist construction?
    In the final analysis, to see problems and speak, you must look at what position you are standing on. If you stand on the people's position to handle contradictions among the people, things will be easy to handle, and problems will be easy to solve. We workers and the Communist Party are of one life and one heart, as inseparable as teeth and tongue. If anyone attempts to knock out our teeth or cut off our tongue, to oppose socialism, our working class will raise the hammer and fight them.

    野心家们不要忘记
    工人阶级会举起铁锤
    右派分子企图把人民内部牙齿与舌头的矛盾，说成是对抗性的矛盾，硬说要敲去牙齿，割去舌头才能解决，这是有心破坏社会主义制度。我们工人和共产党是一条命、一条心，就像牙齿和舌头一样不可分。如果有人企图敲牙齿、割舌头，反社会主义，我们工人阶级会举起铁锤来和他们拼。
    朱顺余的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理的报告。对一九五六年取得伟大的成就，我们工人感到无比的高兴，我们工人完全有信心超额完成第一个五年计划最后一年的任务。特别是在预备会议期间学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，给了我无限的勇气和力量来建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。
    当然，我并不是说，我们国家的建设工作就完全没有缺点了。我今天首先对政府工作提几点意见。
    第一，像我们厂在改建、建设中，从上到下多存有社会主义建设样样要好、多用点钱无所谓的思想，特别是对非生产性的建筑，标准过高了一些，造成若干浪费现象。我看北京的建设也有点同样味道。我还觉得领导我厂的第一机械工业部和有关局的领导人，工作不够深入基层，对工人和工程技术人员的积极性和创造性估计不足。比方说，按照上海汽轮机厂技术设备和生产能力，只要略加措施并修改部分图纸，就能够制造五万瓩汽轮机，我们厂的印总工程师曾积极建议过，四局领导上曾表示可以考虑，但具体的支持还很不够。另外在汽轮发电设备、产销平衡工作方面也有缺点。像上海汽轮机厂的年产能力，造中、小型汽轮机能达到五十万瓩，但今年的生产计划一共只有十四万三千五百瓩的任务，我们厂感到吃不饱。按照第二个五年计划的初步意见，国内订货的汽轮机，只占全部需要的一半不到，我们和哈尔滨汽轮机厂生产能力再多供应数十万瓩也没问题。在目前国家缺少外汇的情况下，应该让国内多制造一些。现在电力工业部向国外订货多了一点，是否电力工业部对国内制造汽轮机还有点不大放心呢？他们是否认为国内的汽轮机技术上可能有问题或者价格太高呢？我们局和厂里认为，技术上目前已可以保证，成本也是可以逐步降低，现在我们造的六千瓩汽轮机的成本，已经比国外买的六千瓩汽轮机的售价低了。希望电力部多拉回一些国外订货，使我们工厂不致造成多抽工人学习的情况。当然，我不是在替我们厂在人代会上拉生意，我主要反映计划不合理情况。
    第二，第一机械工业部所属各局互相联系、互相配合做得不够好，造成了一些浪费。像按照上海汽轮机厂的炼钢能力，今年可以增产四百吨钢左右，但因上海第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局所属各厂，所需要的钢材已经够了，叫我们厂也不要增产了，而同一个部其他局，所领导的厂都因钢材不够，要到外地去买，造成人力物力的浪费。又如去年十月十一日，四局给我们厂发来一个通知，要我们厂在下半年内招收工人和艺徒三百名，我厂劳动科觉得很奇怪。事实上我们厂第一个五年计划的任务已经在去年五月份完成（我在上次人代会上也谈过），第二个五年计划的任务还没有下来，当时生产任务已经不足，人数已经过多，这种情况局的计划单位是知道的，局人事单位却还要我们增加人，为什么会产生这种情况呢？还有部局到基层机构重叠，公文转来转去，手续繁复，给工作带来许多不便。像某些事，厂长可以解决的问题，为了层层负责，处处审查，等上级批下来已过了几个月，造成工厂等公文而影响生产，希望上级机构把可以下放的权力放给基层，使工作切合实际。
    第三，我对领导上处理艺徒也有些意见。当然，有少数学徒受了资产阶级的思想影响，不很好勤学苦练，不尊重老师傅，闹待遇，讲享受，但我认为领导上思想教育工作做得不够好也有责任。比如在动员艺徒学技术时，不从政治思想上教育，却爱说什么学了多少时间就可以升几级技工等等，事实上做不到。许多艺徒反映：
  “我们原来认为学做技术工人很光荣，知道学技术很困难，听了动员报告原来这么容易。”这不是助长了艺徒到了时间只讲升级、不专心学习技术的思想吗？虽然目前已经改正这种做法，但已经留下了一些不良的后果。同时，报纸宣传也有缺点，比如有种报纸上登着某某厂二十七天培养出一个三级电焊工的消息，这也是不切实际的。我希望党、政、工、团领导人继续加强对艺徒实事求是的思想教育，教育青年一代的工人，切实贯彻勤俭建国的方针。
    以上我所提的问题，是人民内部矛盾问题，是我们国家在前进中的问题，是我们在社会主义建设中缺乏经验所造成的问题，是完全可以通过团结——批评——团结这个公式来解决的。如果有人看到一些缺点，就认为我们的国家漆黑一团，认为共产党不行了，社会主义不好了，这是极其荒谬的。他们说这也不好，那也不好，只有他们好。他们企图把人民内部牙齿与舌头碰头的矛盾，说成是对抗性的矛盾，硬说要敲去牙齿，割去舌头才能解决矛盾，这不是有心破坏社会主义制度吗？
    我觉得怎样对待人民内部矛盾，就看你是站在什么立场上看的。比如说，现在人民生活还是好、还是不好呢？我们工人认为比从前好得多了。解放前我们工人穿不着一件像样的衣服，住不着一间像样的房子，在工作时还时常担心失业。我在解放前，失过业，踏过三轮车，踏到的钱同出租车子的小资本家四、六拆账，拼死也吃不饱肚子，在那时我的爱人肚里有小孩要吃白米饭，但没钱怎能吃白米饭呢？只好到姑母家借五斗米，踏来的钱买点蚕豆放进点米一起烧饭，她吃蚕豆少一点的饭，我吃大部分蚕豆，我出去踏车子买点麸皮，做成麸皮饼当饭吃，在那时谁关心过我们的生活呢？现在我们的工资比过去提高了，生了病有病假工资，老了有退职金，死了也有人料理善后，在车间里生产，热天有风扇降温设备，冬天有火炉，我们认为生活比从前好得多，但是，有的右派分子却像在代表我们讲话，说工人生活没有提高。解放前我们没有听到他们说工人苦，现在为什么他们倒替工人诉起苦来呢？拆穿来看，臭得很，原来他们在挑拨工人群众同党和政府的关系，替资本家诉苦罢了。他们挂的羊头，卖的是狗肉。如果现在站在资本家的立场来看今天的生活，他们中间有些人会感到不如从前。身为人民大学讲师的葛佩琦是这些人的好代表。他说，买不到猪肉，不能说人民生活提高。过去买猪肉是不要排队的，经常吃得起肉的是谁呢？难道还要多说吗？
    当然我并不是说，今天工人生活水平已经很高了。我们的国家还很穷，人民生活只能随着生产的发展慢慢提高逐步改善，不能一步登天。有人埋怨工厂里没有游泳池、溜冰场、跳舞厅等，这些要求在目前是不切合实际的。而且就是将来，也不是每个工厂都要有个游泳池、溜冰场、跳舞厅的。这个道理也很明白的。
    又比如有些工人闹事，我们认为这很不好，受到损失的是国家和人民。但是有些野心分子就认为闹事很好，甚至主张到基层中去大放大鸣，煽动群众闹事，企图造成群众与政府的对立，他们来捞一把。我们工人决不会上当。我们工人和自己的党、自己的政府是一家人，我们有意见会向党和政府提，决不允许野心家到我们中间来捞取政治资本。
    右派分子不要党的领导，否认我们社会主义建设的成就，这是有爱国心的人都不能同意的。且不说我国已能制造汽车、喷气式飞机等成绩吧，就拿我们汽轮机厂来说，过去中国连修汽轮机都要送到国外去修，现在我们不但能修汽轮机，还能造六千、一万二千、二万五千瓩的汽轮机，就是五万瓩的大型汽轮机，我们也在准备制造了。我们厂原来设计能力是每年生产汽轮机二十七万五千瓩，现在能达到五十万瓩。设计时最大能造一万二千瓩汽轮机，现在准备造五万瓩。试问，这不是共产党领导的结果吗？这不是社会主义建设的成绩吗？
    归根结底，看问题、说话要看站在什么立场上，如果站在人民的立场来处理人民内部矛盾，事情就好办，问题就好解决。我们工人和共产党是一条命、一条心，就像牙齿和舌头一样不可分开。如果有人企图用敲牙齿、割舌头，反社会主义，我们工人阶级会举起铁锤来和他们拼。
