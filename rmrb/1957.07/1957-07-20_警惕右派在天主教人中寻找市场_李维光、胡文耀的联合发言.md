    We fully agree with Premier Zhou's work report. Premier Zhou's report not only comprehensively summarized the great achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and realistically examined the shortcomings and errors of the government's work, but also sternly criticized the anti-socialist speeches of bourgeois rightists, reflecting the will of the people of the whole country. We Catholics fully support it, and are determined to draw a clear line with all rightists inside and outside the Church, and fight to the end. No matter what the rightists do, they cannot stop our determination to take the socialist road. Zhang Naiqi and Zhang Bojun attempted to find a market among us Catholics, to sow discord between us and the government, to insult and attack us Catholics, and even more viciously, they wanted to incite us to oppose socialism. They said: "When I went to other places to inspect in the past, I held symposiums and found that there were several kinds of people with abnormal attitudes: ① Old intellectuals, old staff; ② Industrialists and businessmen; ③ Religious figures without ethnic relations. Observing their expressions, we felt that these kinds of people had abnormal emotions. Therefore, I feel that the previous major movements were necessary, but the side effects left behind were serious. This time in the rectification movement, we found that many people who seemed mediocre in the past, this time in the great blooming and contending, expressed their opinions, from theory to business, very eloquently, and all their talents were displayed. We are very happy..." I would like to ask Zhang Naiqi and Zhang Bojun, what exactly did you "observe" and "watch" in your inspections in other places?

    In recent years, under the care and attention of the people's government and the support and assistance of people from all walks of life, clergy, monks, nuns, and Catholics all over the country have shown a new atmosphere. The anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics has also achieved great victories with the development and achievements of the motherland, thereby strengthening unity, raising awareness, and giving play to patriotic enthusiasm. Everyone is eagerly demanding to study and make progress, and is willing to contribute all their strength to socialist construction. Taking the Nanjing Diocese as an example, clergy, monks, nuns, and Catholics in various places have also organized and acted. Under the leadership of the Nanjing Diocese Catholic Patriotic Association, they have carried out political theory, current affairs policy studies, and other activities in an organized, led, and planned manner. The clergy not only study hard themselves, but also actively motivate the Catholics to study, and encourage the Catholics to participate in various social activities and production competitions; they use the time after the Catholics attend church on major religious festivals to publicize the government's policies and decrees to the Catholics, assist the government in implementing religious policies, and resolve the doubts in their minds. In recent years, we have achieved many results, and many new people, new things, and advanced models have emerged. Taking Jiangyin in the Nanjing Diocese as an example, more than 200 people among the more than 10,000 Catholics have been rated as advanced models and have been commended and rewarded. Not only is this the case in Jiangyin, but the same is true in all parishes under various dioceses across the country. Since July last year, when the enlarged meeting of initiators of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association was held in the capital, and the preparatory office of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association was formally established, the anti-imperialist patriotic movement in various dioceses across the country has entered a new stage, thus further encouraging the clergy, monks, nuns, and Catholics to actively move forward, and further trusting the government's leadership and religious freedom policy. At present, 241 bishops, deputy bishops, priests, monks, nuns, and Catholics from all walks of life from 26 provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) across the country are holding the National Congress of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association in the capital to discuss the major affairs of loving the country and the Church, and formally establish the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. This is a new milestone in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics in our country, a new development in our anti-imperialist patriotic and Church-loving work, and a great victory of the anti-imperialist patriotic and Church-loving just cause. Is this "abnormal attitude" and "abnormal emotion"?

    In recent years, the government has taken many measures to implement religious policies and solve many difficult problems, making our religious life more normal, happy, and active. For example, in the Songjiang Special Zone of Jiangsu Province, which belongs to the Shanghai Diocese, 144 churches could not normally carry out religious life in the past, but now they have all resumed normal religious activities, with only four places that have not been well resolved. For example, on May 11 this year, more than 15,000 Catholics went to Sheshan, Songjiang, Jiangsu Province, for pilgrimage, which was an unprecedented event. The celebration of Christmas last year was also unprecedentedly enthusiastic in various dioceses. The Sanliqiao Catholic Church in Wuxi General Parish of Nanjing Diocese had more than 10,000 Catholics attending Christmas Mass. Last year's Christmas and this year's Sheshan pilgrimage were also filmed in large-scale documentaries by the Central Newsreel Film Studio. All these facts show the enthusiastic situation of religious activities, and also show the government's great achievements in implementing religious policies. Is this a "serious side effect left over from the previous major movements"? Is this "the shortcomings are the main and the achievements are the secondary"? I fully affirm that the government's achievements in implementing religious policies are huge and main. However, it is undeniable that there are still shortcomings and problems in the work. We believe that there are six aspects to the existing shortcomings and problems:

    First, in the past stage, governments at all levels, especially county, district, and township governments, have not paid enough attention to religious affairs work. Individual regions have failed to deal with some of the housing disputes and the use of churches that we have raised in a timely manner. Although many problems have been dealt with in the past year, they are uneven, and some places have not been properly resolved to this day. For example, there are more than 60 churches in the Yongnian Diocese of Hebei Province that have not been dealt with so far, and their religious life can only be carried out in the homes of Catholics or in the open air. Another example is that when priests in the Xuzhou Diocese go to the countryside to carry out religious activities, they are still obstructed by individual cadres, and even individual regions have tied up and detained priests and Catholics. Although this is an individual phenomenon, the situation is relatively serious and should be corrected in a timely manner.

    Second, at present, in factories, schools, institutions, and villages, there are still a few people, even cadres, who do not have enough understanding of religious policies, and do not have enough understanding of the new situation and new circumstances in our Catholic Church in recent years. They still look at us with old eyes, and cannot adopt a friendly attitude and democratic consultation methods to help us and support us. Some even discriminate against us, disrespect our beliefs, and stimulate our religious feelings, which affect the unity between believers and non-believers. If this continues to develop, it will hinder the positive factors of Catholics to a certain extent. This is not good for the country and our anti-imperialist patriotic just cause.

    Third, there are more than 30 books criticizing religion recently, and some of the content has exceeded the scope of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, but are scolding and distorting. They lack a spirit of seeking truth from facts and have committed the error of dogmatism. The worldviews of theists and atheists are contradictory. They are two opposing philosophical thoughts that have been arguing with each other since ancient times and cannot be compromised. We believe that mutual criticism is possible, but both sides should have an in-depth understanding and express their views based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts. Although atheists and theists have different worldviews, we are completely the same in loving peace, loving the motherland, and jointly building socialist undertakings. Therefore, it is fundamental for us to unite as one. Therefore, we hope that we can expand our unity and strengthen our unity under the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and mutual respect, minimize the differences, maximize the common ground, and work together for our common cause of loving the motherland and building the motherland.

    Fourth, our Church has a lot of property all over the country. The land has been reformed, and the schools and hospitals have been taken over. In this regard, we are willing to abide by the government's policies and decrees, but some schools and hospitals also took over the housing or churches of Church missionaries, monks, and nuns when they were taken over. We believe that this is inappropriate. There are also some land and houses that have not been reformed or taken over, but have been used by people for a long time without being returned. This not only affects the Church's economic income, but also does not comply with the government's policies and decrees. Therefore, we hope that the government will provide legal protection for the Church's property so that our missionary work can be carried out smoothly.

    Fifth, our country's anti-counter-revolutionary movement has made great achievements, and the same is true for the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle within the Catholic Church. Without the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle, our Catholic Church's anti-imperialist patriotic movement would not have the development it has today. Some shortcomings are inevitable. We suggest that the government check the past work in the spirit of "counter-revolutionaries must be eliminated, and mistakes must be corrected." In the past year, many Catholics have been arrested and dealt with, but there are still some cases that have not been dealt with so far. We hope that the judicial department can handle the cases that have not been handled as soon as possible. In addition, individual cases have been sentenced too severely. For example, a female student in Shanghai who was under the age of 18 was deceived and went astray and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities was sentenced to five years in prison. Although the inspection team found the case and made suggestions that have been corrected, please the judicial authorities check and deal with whether similar situations still exist.

    Sixth, the various dioceses of the Catholic Church in our country successively declared in 1951 that they would sever all economic and political relations with foreign countries and raise all funds themselves. At present, the Church's funds only rely on rental income and the donations of Catholics, which is not enough to adapt to the Church's current situation. Regarding this issue, we hope that the government's religious affairs department will fully study it and give us strong support and help.

    Please correct any inappropriate opinions and suggestions above. In short, our close unity with the Communists and the people of all walks of life in New China is fundamental and cannot be broken by anyone, but the rightists still do not recognize this point and are still trying to undermine our unity, vainly trying to use those among us who can be used as their tools. Therefore, raising revolutionary vigilance and preventing destruction from any aspect is of utmost importance to us. Therefore, we hope that the government and people from all walks of life will give us more support and assistance so that we can work closely together with everyone on the road of socialist construction in the motherland and move forward in unison.

    We earnestly advise the rightists such as Zhang Naiqi and Zhang Bojun to immediately confess their serious mistakes and reactionary behaviors to the people. If you always adhere to a reactionary position and even continue to take actions to undermine socialism, then the people of the whole country will never have any tolerance for you! Those who are influenced by the rightists, hope that they can quickly correct their mistakes, participate in the struggle, draw a clear line with the rightists politically and ideologically, more resolutely take the socialist road, and make contributions to socialism.

    警惕右派在天主教人中寻找市场
    李维光、胡文耀的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理的工作报告。周总理的报告不但全面地总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，实事求是地检查了政府工作的缺点和错误，而且严正批判了资产阶级右派分子反社会主义的言论，反映了全国人民的意志。我们天主教人完全拥护，而且坚决与教内外一切右派分子划清界限，斗争到底。不管右派分子怎么样，也阻止不了我们走社会主义道路的决心。章乃器、章伯钧企图在我们天主教人中找寻市场，挑拨我们与政府的团结关系，侮辱和打击我们天主教人，更恶毒的，是他们要挑起我们对社会主义的反对。他们说：“我从前到外地视察，开座谈会，发现有几种人态度不正常：①旧知识分子、旧人员；②工商业者；③没有民族关系的宗教界人士。这几种人，我们察颜观色，情绪不正常。因此，我感到过去几次大运动是必须的，但遗留下来的副作用是严重的。这次整风中发现，有许多人以往看来庸庸碌碌，这次大鸣大放，发表意见，从理论到业务，头头是道，天才都展出来，我们非常高兴……。”我请问章乃器与章伯钧，你们在外地视察中察颜观色，到底是“察”了什么，又“观”了什么呢？
    几年来，我们全国各地的神职人员、修士、修女、教友在人民政府的关怀照顾及各界人士的支持协助下，出现了新的气象。天主教的反帝爱国运动，随着祖国的发展和成就，也获得了极大的胜利，从而加强了团结，提高了觉悟，发挥了爱国热情，大家都迫切地要求学习和进步，愿为社会主义建设贡献一切力量。以南京教区为例，各地的神职人员、修士、修女、教友，也都组织起来、行动起来了。在南京教区天主教友爱国会的领导下，有组织有领导有计划地开展了政治理论、时事政策的学习，以及其他活动。神职人员不仅自己认真学习，而且积极地带动教友学习，鼓舞教友参加各项社会活动和生产竞赛；利用教友在较大的宗教节日出堂以后的时间，向教友们宣传政府的政策法令，协助政府贯彻宗教政策，解决他们思想上存在的疑虑。几年来，获得了不少成绩，涌现出不少新人新事和先进的模范人物。就以南京教区的江阴来说，在一万多教友中被评为先进模范人物获得表扬和奖励的，就有两百多人。不仅江阴一个地区如此，在全国各教区所属各个本堂区，都有同样的情况。自去年七月，在首都召开了中国天主教友爱国会发起人扩大会议，正式成立了中国天主教友爱国会筹备处以后，全国各教区的反帝爱国运动又进入了一个新的阶段，因而更加鼓舞了神职人员、修士、修女、教友积极前进，更加信任政府的领导和宗教信仰自由政策。目前，全国二十六个省（市、自治区）的主教、代主教、神父、修士、修女和各方面的教友共二百四十一位，在首都召开中国天主教友爱国会全国代表会议，共商爱国爱教的大事，并正式成立中国天主教友爱国会。这是我国天主教友反帝爱国运动中的新的里程碑，是我们反帝爱国爱教工作的新发展，也是反帝爱国爱教正义事业的伟大胜利成果。这难道是“态度不正常”“情绪不正常”吗？
    几年来，政府在贯彻执行宗教政策方面采取了很多措施，解决了许多困难问题，使我们的宗教生活更加趋于正常、愉快和活跃。如上海教区在江苏省松江专区部分，过去有一百四十四处教堂不能正常地进行宗教生活，但现在都已恢复正常的宗教活动，只有四处尚未能很好地解决。又如今年五月十一日，前往江苏松江佘山朝圣的教友就有一万五千以上，盛况堪称空前。去年圣诞节，各个教区的庆祝盛况也是空前的热烈。南京教区无锡总铎区无锡三里桥天主堂，就有万余教友望圣诞弥撒。去年圣诞节和今年的佘山朝圣，中央新闻电影制片厂还拍摄了大型记录片，这一切事实都说明宗教活动的热烈情况，这也说明政府贯彻执行宗教政策的巨大成绩。难道这是“过去几次大运动中遗留下来的副作用是严重”的吗？难道这是“缺点是主要成绩是次要的”吗？我完全肯定政府执行宗教政策的成绩是巨大的是主要的。但不可否认，在工作上还存有缺点和问题。我们认为存在的缺点和问题有六个方面：
    第一，在过去的一个阶段中，各级政府，尤其是县、区、乡政府，对宗教事务工作重视的还不够。个别地区对我们提出的一些房屋纠纷和使用教堂等问题未能及时处理。虽去年一年之中已处理了不少问题，但不平衡，至今还有个别地方未能妥善解决。如河北永年教区有六十多个教堂，至今尚未处理，他们的宗教生活，只能在教友家里或露天进行。又如徐州教区神父下乡进行宗教活动，尚受到个别干部的留难，甚至个别地区还有捆绑扣押神父和教友情况的发生。这虽是个别现象，但情况是比较严重的，应设法及时纠正。
    第二，目前在工厂、学校、机关和乡村中，还有少数人，甚至干部，由于对宗教政策认识不够，对我们天主教内部近几年来的新形势新情况认识不足，仍以旧眼光来看待我们，尚不能采用友好的态度和民主协商的办法来帮助我们、支持我们，甚至有的对我们歧视、对我们的信仰不尊重，刺激我们的宗教感情，影响信教的与不信教的之间的团结关系。倘使这样发展下去，就会使天主教友的积极因素受到一定程度的阻碍。这对国家和我们的反帝爱国正义事业，都没有好处。
    第三，最近批判宗教的书籍有三十多本，其中有些内容已超出百花齐放、百家争鸣的范围，而是谩骂和曲解，他们缺乏实事求是的精神，犯了教条主义的错误。有神论者和无神论者的宇宙观是有矛盾的，是两种对立的哲学思想，自古以来就互相争论不能妥协。我们认为互相批判是可以的，但双方应该深入了解，本着实事求是的精神各抒己见。无神论者和有神论者虽在宇宙观上有所不同，但我们在热爱和平、热爱祖国和共同建设社会主义事业上，是完全相同的，因而我们大家团结一致是有基础的。所以希望我们能在求同存异互相尊重的原则下，扩大我们的团结，加强我们的团结，将异的地方尽量缩小，将同的地方尽量扩大，为着我们热爱祖国建设祖国的共同事业，携手前进。
    第四，我们教会在全国各地有不少的财产，土地被土改了，学校医院被接管了，这方面，我们愿遵守政府的政策法令去做，但有些学校医院在接管时，将教会传教士、修士、修女的住房或教堂也接管了，我们认为这是不妥当的。还有些土地和房屋虽未土改和接管，但被人长期使用不还，这不仅影响教会经济的收入，而且也不符合政府的政策法令。所以我们希望政府对教会的财产在法律上给予保障，俾便使我们的传教事业得以顺利开展。
    第五，我国的肃反运动是有极大成绩的，天主教内的肃反斗争同样也是如此。没有肃反斗争我们天主教的反帝爱国运动就不可能有今日的发展。其中有些缺点也是难免的，我们建议政府本着“有反必肃，有错必纠”的精神来检查过去的工作。近一年来被逮捕的天主教人，处理的也不少，但还有些案件，至今尚未处理，我们希望司法部门能尽快地处理尚未处理的案件。另有个别案件量刑过重，如上海有一不满十八岁的女学生因受骗误入歧途，进行了反革命的活动，被判处五年徒刑，虽然视察小组查到该案提出了意见业已纠正，类似情况是否还存在，请司法机关检查处理。
    第六，我国天主教会各个教区，在一九五一年间先后宣布声明与国外割断一切经济政治关系，自己来筹措一切经费，目前教会经费只靠房租收入和教友的奉献，实不足以适应教会今天的情况。有关这个问题，尚希望政府的宗教事务部门，充分地加以研究给予我们大力的支持和帮助。
    以上一些意见和建议，不妥之处请大家指正。总之，我们同共产党人和新中国的各界人民亲密团结是有基础的，也是任何人攻不破的，但右派分子们到现在还不认识这一点，还在那里企图进行破坏我们的团结，妄想利用我们中间可以利用的人来做他们的工具，所以提高革命警惕，防止来自任何方面的破坏对我们来说是有着极重要的关系的。因而，我们希望政府和各界人民多多给予支持和协助，使我们在祖国社会主义建设道路上和大家亲密的携手、齐步前进。
    我们恳切劝告章乃器、章伯钧等右派分子们，要立即向人民交代自己的严重错误和反动行为，如果你们始终坚持反动立场，甚至继续采取破坏社会主义的行动，那末全国人民决不会对你们有任何宽容的！受右派分子影响的人，希望他能够赶快改正错误，参加到斗争中来，在政治上和思想上和右派分子划清界限，更坚决地走社会主义的道路，为社会主义作出贡献。
