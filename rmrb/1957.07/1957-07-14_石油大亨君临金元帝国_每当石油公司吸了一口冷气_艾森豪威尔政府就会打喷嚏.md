Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The "New York Post" recently published a ten-part series by its reporters Robert Spivack and Irwin Lieberman entitled "The Oil Empire." It said that in the United States, "the big oil companies get whatever they want. This is a fact of political life."

The authors said that the American "Oil Empire" has its own "Oil Government," which, on major oil-related issues, makes decisions favorable to oil monopoly groups, replacing the U.S. State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Interior.

The "congress" of the "Oil Government" is the National Petroleum Council, and its "president" is M. J. Rathbone, Chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey. Rathbone determines the policy direction of the "Oil Government" through his leadership of Standard Oil of New Jersey. John Foster Dulles, the former legal counsel of the "Oil Government," is the current U.S. Secretary of State.

Outside the "Oil Government," the "Oil Empire" has also established the most powerful and cunning congressional lobbying group. Big oil companies ensured the election of extreme right-wing senators such as the late McCarthy, as well as Wherry, Dirksen, Schoeppel, and Butler, and provided financial support to Senate Democratic Leader Johnson and Speaker of the House Rayburn. These figures constitute the backbone of the oil lobbying group.

The current Republican government is widely recognized as a government of oil merchants. Eisenhower has placed oilmen in key government positions dealing with oil issues. Currently, oil companies have penetrated virtually every department of the government, from city council activities to demarcate the sphere of influence for gas stations in residential areas to the State Department's negotiations with Nasser. The oil industry even considers American foreign policy to be its private affair.

Democratic Senator Kefauver said: "The officials of this administration have developed a habit that whenever the oil companies catch a cold, they sneeze."

    石油大亨君临金元帝国
    每当石油公司吸了一口冷气  艾森豪威尔政府就会打喷嚏
    据新华社13日讯　“纽约邮报”不久前发表了该报记者罗伯特·斯皮瓦克和欧文·李伯曼所写的十篇总题为“石油帝国”的连载文章。其中说，在美国，“大石油公司要什么，就有什么。这是一个政治生活的事实。”
    作者说，美国“石油帝国”有一个自己的“石油政府”，这个“石油政府”在有关石油的重大问题上代替美国国务院、国防部和内政部作出利于石油垄断集团的决定。
    “石油政府”的“国会”是全国石油委员会，它的“总统”是新泽西美孚油公司董事长麦·杰·拉思博恩，拉思博恩通过对新泽西美孚油公司的领导，来决定“石油政府”的政策方针。“石油政府”的前法律顾问杜勒斯是现任美国国务卿。
    “石油帝国”在“石油政府”之外还成立了一个最强大而狡黠过人的国会院外活动集团。大石油公司使已故的麦卡锡以及威尔克、德克森、舍佩尔和巴特勒这些极右派的参议员当选，并且向参议院民主党领袖约翰逊和众议院议长雷朋提供财政支持。这些人物构成了石油院外活动集团的中坚人物。
    现在共和党政府被公认为是石油商的政府，艾森豪威尔把石油家们安插在处理石油问题的政府要位上。目前，在政府各个部门中，石油企业几乎是无孔不入的，从市议会要在居住区划分加油站的势力范围的活动到国务院和纳赛尔的交涉。石油业甚至认为美国的外交政策都是它们的私事。
    民主党参议员克弗德尔说过：“本届政府的官员已经养成习惯，每当石油公司吸了一口冷气的时候，他们就会打喷嚏。”
