China's Nascent Construction Force Rapidly Grows
Sun Dehe said that this is inseparable from the painstaking cultivation of the Party and the government, and the Soviet Union's selfless assistance with a large amount of data and introduction of experience.
I fully agree with and firmly support the various reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, the Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and will support these reports with actions. Now I will talk about the education and experience I gained from participating in this National People's Congress.

(1) Studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has made my eyes brighter and greatly improved my level of understanding, making my originally not very sensitive political sense more sensitive. In particular, the six criteria enable us to stand firm, improve our ability to distinguish right from wrong, and draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy. This is the greatest education for me.

In the process of leading the Chinese people from one victory to another new victory, the Party began a rectification movement, inviting people from all over the country, non-Party members, and democratic party members to offer opinions on the basis of socialist principles, so as to better improve the shortcomings in the work. This is the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, the closer relationship between the Party and the people, and the further development of Marxism-Leninism. However, in this movement, a group of right-wing ambitious elements took advantage of the rectification opportunity to issue absurd remarks and carry out anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy activities. These people attempted to use the opportunity to obliterate the obvious achievements of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party in recent years, to obliterate the great achievements created by the hard work of thousands of millions of working people, to reverse black and white, to maliciously slander and attack the Party, to expand individual shortcomings, and to set fires everywhere, with the aim of satisfying the conspiracy attempts of individual ambitious elements, usurping leadership, and leading the people back to the anti-socialist road of eternal damnation. This is extremely hateful, and it is intolerable to anyone with a little conscience. With unparalleled anger, we resolutely stood up to resolutely counterattack the conspiracies of Zhang, Luo, and other anti-socialist, anti-Party, and anti-people elements. We firmly followed the Communist Party to fight to the end, eliminate the enemy, and transform ourselves in the struggle.

(2) Chairman Mao mentioned in his report that "After three five-year plans, or a little more time, China's steel production may still develop from the highest annual output before liberation, that is, more than 900,000 tons in 1943, to 20 million tons, or a little more." This requirement is extremely exciting for steel workers. The staff in the field of black metallurgy design are more willing to dedicate all their strength to complete this glorious and arduous task. We have great confidence.

The production level of 20 million tons of steel per year is roughly equivalent to the production level of the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War, the level of the United Kingdom in 1955, and the level of West Germany in 1954 and 1955, and is also roughly equivalent to the total of France and Japan in 1955. We know how closely steel production is related to the entire industrial production index. China's steel production can reach about five million tons this year. This great achievement includes the hard work of many people day and night. The output increased by 1.61 million tons in 1956 alone. Can we tolerate the right-wing elements' obliteration of the facts?

Now let's talk about the situation in basic construction design.

Before 1953, although China had restored and developed steel production, and a large number of employees were engaged in unremitting struggle on this front, although we also had a certain number of scientific research workers and production engineering technicians in steel smelting, the design work for the huge steel joint enterprise had just begun. At that time, the design level almost started from "zero." This design work is something that cannot be learned in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, these complete sets of design experience are controlled by a very small number of private companies. In our country, it is difficult to summarize systematic data, specifications, quotas, systems, experience, and cultivate personnel without a lot of construction practice. Since 1953, the Party and the government have organized a large number of technical personnel (old and young) to start a hard march towards this work. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the specific help of experts, and through more than four years of actual work tests, thousands of engineering design forces have been cultivated. Now it has the ability to combine China's specific conditions and circumstances to conduct site selection, design task considerations, preliminary design, technical design, and preparation of complete sets of construction and installation drawings for steel plants of all sizes from mines to finished products (including new-style steel joint enterprises). More importantly, under the socialist principle, how to correctly combine politics, economy, and technology, and comprehensively consider issues, and under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party and leadership, there has also been great progress. Through actual work, the designers have undertaken the construction drawings of many workshops in China's three major steel bases, and they have also completed the complete design of the expansion of some factories. These factories and workshops are under construction or have been put into production. For example, Anshan's modern blast furnace, Benxi's blast furnace, Anshan's coke oven, the reconstruction of the No. 1 and No. 2 steelmaking plants, the reconstruction of the primary rolling mill, and some parts of the mine, as well as some parts of Wu and Baotou Steel that are under construction, are all construction drawings supplied domestically. Although many difficulties were encountered in the construction process, they were overcome, and tens of thousands of new engineering construction talents and forces were cultivated. They are also designing a series of medium-sized mines and small enterprises according to China's specific conditions, in order to increase China's steel production faster, give better play to investment effects, reflect the Party's call for diligence and thrift in building the country, and change the distribution of China's steel industry. In this huge project, Party members and non-Party members, management personnel and technical personnel coordinated to undertake major tasks. These facts should be considered the beginning of a new stage in the development of China's steel industry. Because in the future, more and larger-scale construction will mostly rely on the efforts of our country's own scientific research workers, design and construction personnel, and equipment design and manufacturing. According to the Party Central Committee's policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, because smaller plants in the locality can use general technical levels combined with China's current actual situation, the investment in unit annual output can be saved by about one-third to one-half compared with the investment in large enterprises, and the dispersed resources can be used to quickly increase output. This will better combine China's specific circumstances, and will also save more foreign exchange needs. With the accumulation of work experience and the continuous improvement of the level, it will better reflect the increase in production and conservation, save construction investment, reduce infrastructure costs, spend less money, and do more things.

Such a nascent construction force has grown vigorously on China's soil with a very weak scientific and technological foundation in the past. It has been painstakingly cultivated and irrigated by the Party and the government. In this regard, we have a deeper understanding and heartfelt gratitude. This is also inseparable from the Soviet Union's selfless assistance with a large amount of data and introduction of experience. If there were no such support conditions and only relied on our own country to accumulate and summarize experience, it is estimated that it would take about fifteen years to cultivate such a force. In addition, a huge amount of tuition fees would have to be paid materially. Because the summary of experience cannot be separated from construction practice.

These tasks are carried out under the organizational leadership of the Party. We intellectuals dared not expect this in the old China. Isn't this a concrete fact of the Party's major achievements in leading science and technology?

I think these facts should be a great factual education for those who hold prejudices against socialist construction, those who obliterate facts and are unwilling to see the truth, and those who oppose the socialist road. It can help them understand the truth and recognize the facts. If the right-wing elements stubbornly refuse to admit these truths and persist in their mistakes, they will cut themselves off from the people and will be crushed by the torrent of the people.

Like all things in nature, this nascent force, due to its short time and lack of experience, still has many shortcomings. There are also many aspects that need to be continuously improved, especially to rely more on the support and cooperation of infrastructure factories, scientific research, universities and equipment manufacturing. What is needed more is the Party's strengthening of ideological leadership and the supervision, cultivation, and guidance of the people of the whole country, through our own continuous efforts, to correct shortcomings and mistakes, so that we can better and faster serve the construction of socialism.

    我国新生的建设力量迅速成长
    孙德和说，这是同党和政府辛苦的培养，苏联无私的援助大量资料和介绍经验分不开的。
    我完全同意并且坚决拥护周总理及李、薄副总理，常务委员会、最高人民法院与最高人民检察院的各项报告，并且将以行动支持这些报告。现在谈一谈我参加本届人代大会所得的教育与体会。
    （一）学习了毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，使得我的眼睛又亮了一些，认识的水平有很大的提高，使我原来不很敏感的政治嗅觉，比较敏感了，特别是六项标准使得我们能站稳立场，提高了明辨是非，与划清敌我界限的能力。这对我是最大的教育。
    在领导中国人民从一个胜利走向另一个新的胜利的过程中，党开始整风运动，邀请全国人民，非党与民主党派人员在社会主义原则的基础上来提意见，借以更好的改进工作中的缺点，这是中国共产党的伟大，是党与人民血肉相连的关系更加密切，是马列主义进一步的发扬光大。但是在这次运动中，出现了一部分右派野心分子利用整风的机会，发出荒谬言论进行反党反人民反对社会主义的阴谋活动。这些人企图利用机会抹煞这几年来有目共睹的在党领导下的社会主义建设成就，企图抹煞千千万万劳动人民辛勤创造的伟大成就，企图颠倒黑白，对党进行恶毒污蔑与进攻，扩大个别的缺点，到处点火，目的在于满足个别野心分子阴谋企图，篡窃领导，将人民重行引向万劫不复的反社会主义的道路上去。这是万分令人痛恨的事，这是任何稍有良知的人不能容忍的。我们以无比的愤怒，并坚决的站起来向章、罗以及其他反社会主义反党反人民的阴谋予以坚决的回击，我们坚决的随着共产党走，斗争到底，消灭敌人，并在斗争中改造自己。
    （二）毛主席在报告里提到“经过三个五年计划，或者再多一些的时间，我国钢的产量仍然可能由解放前最高年产量，即一九四三年的九十多万吨，发展到二千万吨，或者更多一点。”这个要求对于钢铁工作者来讲都是无比兴奋的。黑色冶金设计方面的工作人员更愿以实际行动献出全部力量，来完成这项光荣而繁重的任务。我们是有极大的信心的。
    年产二千万吨钢的生产水平约相当于苏联卫国战争时的生产水平，英国一九五五年的水平，西德一九五四、五五年的水平，也大致相当于法国与日本一九五五年的总和。我们知道钢的生产与整个工业生产指标有怎样的密切关联。我国的钢铁生产今年已可达到约五百万吨，这个伟大的成就里包括了多少人的日日夜夜的辛勤劳动。仅在一九五六年一年即增长了一百六十一万吨的产量，这种飞跃发展的成就，我们能容忍右派分子的抹煞事实吗？
    现在再谈谈基本建设设计方面的情况。
    我国一九五三年以前尽管恢复与发展了钢铁生产，有大量的职工在这个战线上进行不懈的斗争，尽管我们也有一定数量的钢铁冶炼方面的科学研究工作者与生产的工程技术人员，但对于庞大的钢铁联合企业的设计工作则才开始。那时的设计水平几乎是从“零”点开始。这项设计工作是在资本主义国家所学不到的东西，在资本主义国家里这些成套的设计经验都是掌握在极少数的私人公司手里。在我国内不通过大量的建设实践也难于总结出系统的资料、规范、定额、制度、经验与培养出人员来。从一九五三年开始，党与政府组织了大量的技术人员（老年与年青的）开始向这一工作进行艰苦的进军，由于取得了苏联的无私援助与专家的具体帮助，并且通过了约四年多的实际工作考验，已经培育出了数以千计的工程设计力量。现在已有能力结合我国具体条件及情况进行大大小小的钢铁厂从矿山到成品（包括新式的钢铁联合企业）的厂址选择，设计任务的考虑，进行初步设计，技术设计以及全套的施工安装图纸的制备。更重要的是在社会主义的原则下如何正确的结合政治、经济、技术，全面的考虑问题，在党与领导的不断培养教育之下也有了很大的进步。通过实际工作，设计工作者们已承担了我国三大钢铁基地许多车间的施工图纸，他们也完成了一些厂的扩建全套设计，这些厂与车间正在紧张的进行施工或已投入生产。例如鞍山的现代化的高炉，本溪的高炉，鞍山的焦炉，一二炼钢厂的改建，初轧的改建，还有矿山的部分，武、包钢的某些正在施工的部分，都是国内供应的施工图。在施工的过程里虽然遇到不少的困难，但都得到了克服，而且培育出数以万计的新的工程建设人才与力量，并正在根据我国具体条件进行一系列中型厂矿与小型企业的设计工作，以更快的提高我国钢铁的产量，更好的发挥投资效果，体现党所号召的勤俭建国的方针，并改变我国钢铁工业的分布情况。在这项庞大的工作里党员与非党员，管理人员与技术人员协调的担任着重大的工作任务。这些事实应该认为我国钢铁工业发展上的一个新的阶段的开始。因为今后的更多与更大规模的建设将绝大部分依靠我国自己的科学研究工作者，设计与施工人员，设备设计与制造方面的努力来完成更多更大的建设任务。根据党中央所提的大、中、小企业结合的方针，由于在地方性的小型厂可以使用结合我国目前实际情况采用一般的技术水平，单位年产量的投资约可以比大型企业的投资节约三分之一到二分之一，并且可以利用分散的资源很快的增加产量。这将更好的结合我国具体情况，也会节约更多的外汇需要。随着工作经验的积累与水平的不断提高，将会更好的体现增产节约节省建设投资，降低基建费用，少花钱，多办事。
    在我国过去科学技术基础特薄弱的土壤上茁壮出这样新生的建设力量，是经过党与政府辛苦的培养灌溉的。在这方面我们有更为深刻的体会与内心的感谢的。这也是与苏联的无私的大量资料援助与经验介绍分不开的。假如没有这样的支援条件只依靠我国自己去累积与总结经验，估计可能需要约十五年左右的时间，才能培养出这样力量，另外还要在物质上付出极大的学费。因为经验的总结是不能脱离建设实践而产生的。
    这些工作都是在党的组织领导之下进行的。我们这些知识分子在旧中国时是不敢于奢望的。难道这不是党领导科学技术的重大成就的具体事实吗？
    我想这些事实应该对那些对社会主义建设抱着偏见的一类的人，对抹煞事实不愿看见真理的人，对反对社会主义道路的人是一个很大的事实教育。可以帮助他们认识真理认识事实。右派分子如果顽固的不愿承认这些真理坚持错误，就是自绝于人民，就会被人民的洪流冲得粉碎。
    自然与一切事物一样，这个初生的力量，由于时间不长，经验不多，还存在着不少的缺点。也还有很多方面需要不断的努力改进的，特别是要更多的依靠基建厂，科学研究，高等学校与设备制造方面的支持与协作。更需要的是党的加强思想领导与全国人民的督促、培养与指导，通过自身的不断努力，纠正缺点与错误，使我们能更好更快的为建设社会主义服务。
