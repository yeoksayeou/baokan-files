    Questioning the Editorial Department of "Current Affairs Handbook"

    Based on several reports in the recently published issues 10 and 11 of the "Current Affairs Handbook," it seems that the editorial department has embarked on the political path of the bourgeoisie, standing with the bourgeois right-wing reactionaries for a period of time.

    I would like to supplement the following materials. In the article "Gentle Breeze and Timely Rain, Great Blooming and Great Airing," written in the name of the "Current Affairs Handbook" reference room, the last section is titled "Relieving Concerns, Industrial and Commercial Circles Begin to Pour Out Their Hearts." What heartfelt words are they pouring out? It turns out they are talking about two things: demanding an extension of fixed interest to twenty years and demanding the withdrawal of public representatives from joint ventures. The article equally narrates the positive and negative opinions regarding these two issues. It is simply impossible for people to discern whether the "Current Affairs Handbook" opposes or supports these actions. However, since the title of this section is "Pouring Out Their Hearts," and the beginning of this section plagiarizes the provocative claims of right-wingers like Zhang Naiqi, who alleged that capitalists have a "sense of inferiority," it is very clear that the author of this article is standing on the side of the bourgeois right-wingers who are resisting socialist transformation. Even more strangely, the last small paragraph of the article speaks in a completely煽动性 tone: "People in industrial and commercial circles can be said to have started airing their views... the voices of blooming are shaking the national industrial and commercial circles. But the loud voices mostly come from cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Hangzhou, and there is still a need for great blooming and great airing on a nationwide scale within each enterprise." Isn't this encouraging capitalists to set fires in grassroots enterprises everywhere?

    The three short commentaries in the "Three Words and Two Phrases" column of the "Current Affairs Handbook" issue 11 are also very vicious. The first one is called "Height of Principle," and its content is mocking individual Communist Party members for inappropriately labeling people with hats such as "bourgeois ideology" and "bourgeois style." The article cites three examples that were deliberately exaggerated by right-wingers, and then exaggerates them infinitely, saying: "In our real life, such things are countless." The conclusion of the article is: "This kind of criticism is neither humane nor reasonable. From this kind of criticism, it is often easy to smell a sectarian and dogmatic flavor." I would say: From this short article, one can indeed smell the vicious hatred of the bourgeois right-wingers towards the working class and the Communist Party.

    The second topic is "Mr. or Comrade?". The article directly echoed a statement by Ye Duyi. Ye Duyi attacked the Communist Party members at a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department, saying that they called democratic people "Mr." instead of "Comrade." This short article said: "Then, is there any difference between 'Mr.' and 'Comrade' in our current society? I don't see much difference. The large-scale class struggle has basically ended, and everyone is working together to build socialism. What's wrong with calling each other 'Comrade'?" As everyone knows, Mr. Zhou Jianren made a factual explanation of this issue in his speech at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department. However, the author of this article insists on opposing Mr. Zhou Jianren's statement, insists on drawing bourgeois right-wingers as "comrades," and completely wipes out the boundaries between class and class, party and non-party.

    Finally, I would also like to particularly point out that the eleventh issue of the "Current Affairs Handbook" was published on June 6. At this time, Chairman Mao's important speech when he met with all the representatives of the Third National Congress of the Youth League had already been published for several days. This speech was published at an important moment of "blooming" and "airing," and it gave people directions. In this speech, Chairman Mao especially emphasized that the Communist Party of China is the core of the people of the whole country, pointing out that "without such a core, the socialist cause cannot be victorious"; and he also emphatically warned people: "All remarks and actions that deviate from socialism are completely wrong." It seems that the editorial department of the "Current Affairs Handbook" does not like to listen to this important teaching of Chairman Mao. This situation is particularly noteworthy. While the editorial department of the "Current Affairs Handbook" was selling a large number of reactionary remarks from bourgeois right-wingers, it took a contemptuous or even intolerable attitude of contempt towards the aforementioned important speech of Chairman Mao. According to convention, the "Current Affairs Handbook" always reprints important instructions issued by the Party Central Committee and important speeches by Chairman Mao concerning current affairs in the most prominent position. According to the nature and tasks of the "Current Affairs Handbook," this is completely correct. But this time it was an exception. Although the central newspapers published Chairman Mao's speech in the most prominent position, the "Current Affairs Handbook" did not reprint it, but only quoted a few sentences in the last column of "News Briefs," and even the title was omitted! I would like to question the editorial department of the "Current Affairs Handbook": Why is this?

### 质问时事手册编辑部

    质问时事手册编辑部
    根据不久以前出版的时事手册第十期、十一期上几篇报道看来，时事手册编辑部是走上了资产阶级的政治方向，在一个时期内和资产阶级反动右派分子站在一起了。
    我补充提出下面几点材料。在用时事手册资料室名义写的“春风化雨、大放大鸣”一文中，最后一节题为“解除顾虑，工商界开始诉说衷肠”。诉说什么衷肠呢？原来是诉说两件事：要求延长定息到二十年和要求撤出合营企业的公方代表。文中等量齐观地叙述了有关这两个问题的正面的和反面的意见。人们简直看不出来，时事手册究竟是反对这样做呢还是赞成这样做。但是这一节的标题既然是“诉说衷肠”，这节的开头又抄袭了右派分子章乃器等所谓资本家有“自卑感”的挑拨性的说法，所以很显然，该文作者的立场是站在抵抗社会主义改造的资产阶级右派分子方面了。更奇怪的是，文章的最末一小段，完全是以煽动性的口吻说话的：“工商界人士可以说已经开始鸣放了，……鸣声震动全国工商界。但响亮的鸣声多半来自京、津、沪、汉、杭等城市，还有待在全国范围内在本企业里大放大鸣”。这岂不是在鼓动资本家到各个基层企业去放火吗？
    时事手册第十一期“三言两语”栏内的三篇短评也很恶毒。第一篇叫做：“原则高度”，内容是嘲笑个别共产党员不适当地给人戴“资产阶级思想”和“资产阶级作风”等帽子的。文章举了三个为右派分子所故意渲染的例子，又加以无限地夸张说：“在我们的现实生活中，像这样的事是不胜枚举的。”文章的结论是：“这种批评，既不合乎人情，又不合乎道理。从这种批评中，常常容易嗅出一种宗派主义和教条主义的味道。”我倒要说：从这篇短文里，的确可以嗅出资产阶级右派分子对工人阶级和共产党的恶毒憎恨的味道来。
    第二篇题目是“先生乎？同志乎？”。文章直接附和了叶笃义的一个说法。叶笃义在统战部召集的座谈会上攻击共产党员，说他们把民主人士叫做“先生”，而不叫做“同志”。这篇短文说：“那末，我们现在的社会里，先生跟同志之间有无区别呢？我看没有什么大区别。现在大规模的阶级斗争已经基本结束，大家都在同心协力建设社会主义，彼此称呼同志有何不可呢？”大家知道，关于这个问题，周建人先生在统战部召开的座谈会上的发言中曾经作过实事求是的说明。可是本文的作者却偏偏反对周建人先生的说法，偏偏乐于把资产阶级右派分子引为“同志”，把阶级和阶级的界限，党和非党的界限一笔抹杀掉。
    最后，我还想特别指出：第十一期时事手册是在6月6日出版的。这时候，毛主席接见青年团三大全体代表时的重要讲话已经发表了几天了。这个讲话是在“鸣”“放”的重要时刻发表的，是给人们指示方向的。毛主席在这个讲话中，特别强调了中国共产党是全国人民的核心，指出“没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利”；又强调地警告了人们：“一切离开社会主义的言论行动是完全错误的”。看来，毛主席这个重要的教导，时事手册编辑部是不喜欢听取的。这种情况特别值得人们注意。时事手册编辑部在大量贩卖资产阶级右派分子的反动言论的时候，对于上述毛主席的重要讲话却采取了轻视的甚至是不可容忍的蔑视态度。按照惯例，党中央发出的重要指示和毛主席发表的有关时事的重要讲话，时事手册总是在最显著的地位加以转载。根据时事手册的性质和任务，这样做是完全正确的。但是这次却例外，尽管中央各报都在最显著地位刊载了毛主席的这个讲话，时事手册却没有加以转载，只是在最末一栏“要闻简报”里引了几句，甚至连标题也没有！我要质问时事手册编辑部：这究竟是为什么？
