    印度尼西亚共产党中央机关遭暴徒袭击
    据新华社雅加达5日电　4日晚上十一点左右，阴谋分子向设在雅加达的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会办事处和全印度尼西亚工会中央组织办事处投掷手榴弹，结果，工会中央组织办事处的一个守夜者手部被炸伤，印度尼西亚共产党中央办事处的屋瓦被炸毁，此外没有其他损失。
    当阴谋分子向印度尼西亚共产党中央办事处投掷手榴弹的时候，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地和第一副总书记鲁克曼正在屋内办公。他们镇定地应付了这一恐怖事件。办事处周围的居民在事件发生后，立刻自动集中到办事处加以保护。雅加达卫戍司令和大批军警赶到现场进行调查，并就这一事件对艾地等表示遗憾，而且表示将立即进行查究。
    印度尼西亚共产党五中全会4日晚在党中央办事处恰好没有开会。
