I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

My speech is to ask the rightists, do they still have a conscience? I will make a conclusion on their behalf: they have no conscience. This is not arbitrary; I am making a judgment based on the fundamental facts. Besides the facts published in various newspapers and exposed by various representatives, I will further explain why the rightists are not worthy of being called human. Since they are called humans, they have eyes to see, ears to hear, and a mind to think. This ability to see, hear, and think is called sensation, which is the basic instinct of a so-called human being. There is absolutely no reason why one should not respond to sensation. If there is such a case, then although the name calls them human, they are actually people without conscience.

Let us use this to measure the rightists.

In the eight years since liberation, the Communist Party has done countless good things for the people. If these facts had not yet been realized, and we were just chatting and predicting that a most oppressed, poorest, most backward country, where the people are most oppressed and exploited, a country that was already a broken-down household, would suddenly become an independent, self-reliant country with high prestige in less than eight years, and that more than 500 million workers and peasants within the country would forever be free from oppression and exploitation and become masters of the country; and that on this ruin, many unprecedented heavy industries would be built, with self-made airplanes in the sky and self-made cars on the ground; that railway construction could make high mountains give way and rivers change course; that river control could predictably turn the Yellow River, which has been turbulent and muddy for thousands of years and harmful and unprofitable, into a clear and beneficial Yellow River. These are just a few major examples; there are countless others. As a result, national production increases year after year, people's lives improve, every family is well-fed and warm, and every household sings praises. If such words were said beforehand, people would definitely say you are dreaming. No wonder, such a great transformation, the achievement of even one of these things would be amazing, let alone so many great things. It is not surprising that people did not believe it beforehand.

But today it has been realized; everything is a fact.

Therefore, 600 million Chinese people have seen and heard it with their own eyes and ears, and enjoyed it personally. Therefore, their hearts have all responded with joy and excitement, sincerely wanting to support the Communist Party, love the Communist Party, resolutely take the socialist road, and resolutely obey the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the whole country united to formulate a constitution and make it a system. This is a natural response to sensation, not something the Communist Party can force.

But the rightists are different. They oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, oppose socialism, and oppose the leadership of the Party. I think, how can this small group of rightists enjoy such happiness together with 600 million people, and yet be so contrary? Facing the vivid facts before them, don't they have eyes, ears, or hearts? I couldn't understand it no matter how hard I thought. At first, I suspected that some said they had ambitions and conspiracies, which might be too much. After thinking for a few days, I suddenly understood and decided that they have ambitions, conspiracies, and even reactionary attempts. I deduced this from simple but fundamental psychology. Whenever a person has ulterior motives, so-called single-minded in expecting a swan to arrive, he cannot see the things before his eyes. Even if thunder strikes down the pillar beside him, he will not see it, hear it, or feel it. But their lack of sensation is not woodenness, because they have ambitions, conspiracies, and reactionary attempts. Their sensations distort the facts and are completely inconsistent with the true facts. As a result, east can be said to be west, white can be turned into black, good things are said to be bad, beneficial things are said to be harmful. They disregard violating the constitution, shaking the foundation of the country, and committing illegal and undisciplined crimes. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi are typical examples of this. People say they open their eyes and tell lies, but in my opinion, they are completely without conscience and say inhuman words. How do I know this?

Capitalist countries started entirely by means of robbers and plunder, which is already notoriously disgusting. But the rightists insist on saying that stinky things are fragrant. The broad masses say that socialism is fragrant, but they say it is dogma. Dogma is a stinky thing. Not distinguishing between fragrance and stench like this, I don't know what the rightists consider themselves to be. Representative Deng Chumin compared them to the Zhongshan wolf. Can it be said that a wolf still has a human heart! My words may be too heavy, because I am older. Ever since I had a little knowledge, I encountered the shame of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. I was already fifteen years old and was taking exams at that time. Afterwards, a series of foreign aggressions, a series of internal chaos, the Xinhai Revolution was commendable for overthrowing the imperial system, but the warlords who fought and plundered made the whole country uneasy, with no year without trouble. Especially during the twenty years of the Chiang regime, merchants were in power in the court, wealth flowed upwards, the people were destitute, and there were tragedies everywhere. Japan took the opportunity and almost destroyed the country. The fate of the country is closely related to my own, and I have spent my life in indignation, depression, and pain. Finally, I encountered liberation and lived a happy life, even if I died at the age of seventy, I would not have been able to see the bright world that has never existed in history, which is truly exhilarating and makes me infinitely happy for mankind. I think human hearts are the same. Today, the hearts of 600 million people are the same. How can there be some rightists who are stubborn and refuse to change, opposing the same heart of 600 million people, which makes me extremely angry, and the people of the whole country are also extremely angry. Therefore, we are denouncing them in unison and will absolutely not hastily retreat. It is truly a pity that such a good country and a good Communist Party, they do not privately own a single tile or piece of land, and they serve the people day and night with tireless dedication, and in just eight years they have made so many arduous and great achievements, and they are still afraid of deviations and errors, calling on non-Party members to help the Party rectify its style. Such openness and righteousness, we should be grateful and admire, and we should work together to help rectify the style and accelerate socialist construction, which is the right thing to do. Why do the rightists have ambitions and conspiracies? They do not have a single honest and kind heart, thereby isolating themselves from 600 million people, isolating themselves from humanity. Do they still have a human heart? They have no human heart. Fortunately, the human skin still exists, and they can still return to their original nature. Rightists, wake up, east, west, north, and south, don't go astray, it is best to turn back and take the socialist road. Today I am summoning your souls.

    绝不草率收兵
    卢子鹤的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的报告。
    我的发言是问右派分子还有人心吗？我代他作出结语是没有人心的，不是武断，我是从根本上事实上来断定的。除了各报所载和各位代表所揭发出来的事实已足证明外，我再从人的这个称号来说明右派分子之无人心，既称为人，他就有眼能看，有耳能听，有心能思想，这个能看能听能思想，就叫做感应，这是号称为人的起码本能。绝没得感而不应的道理。如果有的话，就是名字叫他做人，而实际已经是没有人心的人了。
    持此来衡量右派分子。
    自解放八年来，共产党对人民所作的好事，数不胜数。如果这些事实尚未做出来，我们摆龙门阵（就是谈天）预说有一个最受欺侮、最贫困、最落后、人民是最受压迫、最受剥削、已经是一个破落户的国家，才不到八年突然变成一个独立自主威望甚高的国家，而国内则有五万万以上的工农群众已永远不受压迫不受剥削都成为国家的主人翁。并且在这个废墟上建设许多从来没有的重工业，天上有自己制造的飞机，地下有自己制造的汽车，修铁路能使高山让路河水改道，治河可预计把几千年乱流而混浊有害无利的黄河，使他变得澄清变成有利无害的黄河。此只举出些荦荦大者，其他屈指难终。因而全国生产年年增加，人民生活改善，家家饱暖，户户讴歌。在事前说这样的话，人们一定要说你在说梦话，也无怪，这样大的转变，成就内中一件事也可惊奇，何况做了这样多的大事，人们在事先不信，是无足怪的。
    但今天已经实现了，件件是事实了。
    因此，中国六亿人亲眼亲耳所闻见，亲身所享受，所以内心无不起了欣欣然的感应，心悦诚服的要拥护共产党，爱戴共产党，坚决要走社会主义道路，坚决要服从共产党领导，因而举国同心制定宪法，成为制度，这是有感有应的自然的，不是共产党所能强求得来的。
    而右派分子则不然，他们反对无产阶级专政、反对社会主义、反对党的领导，我想这一小撮右派分子和六亿人一同享受这样幸福，怎么又会这样相反呢？摆在面前活生生事实，难道他们没有眼耳没有心肝吗。我百思不得其解，起初还疑。有些说他们有野心有阴谋未免过火，我想了几天，忽然明白了，决定他们是有野心阴谋，还有反动企图的。我是从浅显的，但是根本上的心理推测出来的。凡是一个人心中别有企图，所谓一心以为有鸿鹄将至，眼前的事他都看不见，甚至霹雳震倒了他身旁的柱头，他也会看不见，听不闻，心也不会起感应的。但他们的不起感应，不是木然，因为他们有野心有阴谋有反动企图，他的感应就都歪曲事实，与真的事实完全不相应，其结果，东可说成西，白可变为黑，好的他说成坏的，有利的说成有害的，以致违悖宪法，动摇国本，造成违法乱纪的罪行，他们都不顾了。章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器就是这样的典型人物。人说他们睁起眼睛说瞎话，据我看他们是全无心肝说出非人的话，何以见得呢？
    资本主义国家完全用强盗抢劫人的手段起家，已经臭不可闻。但是臭的东西，右派分子硬要说他是香的，广大群众说社会主义是香的，他说是教条，教条就是臭东西。这样香臭不分，我不知右派分子自居何等。邓初民代表比他们为中山狼，狼还可说他有人心吗！我这句话未免太重，因为我年岁较高，自稍有知识即遘甲午之耻，我那时十五岁已经在应试了，嗣后一连串的外侮，一连串的内乱，辛亥革命可庆的是推翻帝制，但争夺攘杀之军阀，闹得全国不宁，无一年没有。尤其蒋政权二十年中，商贾在朝，货财上流，民不聊生，遍地惨黩，日本乘隙，几至亡国。国家休戚，切己相关，终身在愤慨抑郁痛苦中过日子。好容易遇到了解放，过了幸福的生活，使我在七十岁那年就死了，还不能看到历史从来没有过的光明世界，真令人胸襟开豁，并为人类庆幸无穷。我想人心是相同的，今天已是六万万的人心皆相同的，何来一些右派分子冥顽不灵，反对六万万人相同的心，使我愤恨极了，全国人也愤恨极了。所以同声申讨，绝不草率收兵。真可惜，这样好的国家，好的共产党，他们不私置一椽寸土日夜焦心劳思忘我的为人民服务，短短八年做出若干艰巨伟大成绩，还生怕有偏差错误，号召党外人士帮助党整风，这样的光明正大，我们应该感激钦佩，应该戮力同心帮助整风，加速社会主义建设，才是正理。右派分子为何反有野心阴谋的企图，没有一点正直善良的心以自绝于六万万人，自绝于人的还有人心吗？是没有人心了。好得人皮尚存，还可返本还原。右派分子醒转来罢，东西南北，不要乱往，还是回头走社会主义道路顶好，我今天为你们招魂。
