Peace and Friendship Overflowing, Beautiful Youth Blossoming
World Youth Festival Grandly Opens

(People's Daily, Moscow, July 28) The Sixth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship opened in Moscow today. Moscow is filled with a youthful, peaceful, and friendly atmosphere. These days, youth representatives from all over the world have converged on Moscow. Today, they gathered from all corners of Moscow at the Central Stadium under Lenin Hills for a grand opening ceremony.

Around ten o'clock in the morning, youth delegations from 122 countries met in front of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition in the northeast district of Moscow. At 11:45, tens of thousands of young people from various countries, riding in hundreds of cars, led by a motorcycle team holding peace dove flags, festival flags, and blowing peace horns, marched along the sixteen-kilometer-long Happiness Road towards the Central Stadium in the southwest of the city. More than a million Moscow citizens lined the streets to welcome them, constantly shouting slogans of "Peace—Friendship" and "Hurrah." Some stood on rooftops, some on bridges, and every window was filled with people.

Youth representatives from various countries wore different national costumes, played instruments, held flags, and waved handkerchiefs and flowers. Representatives from Australia, Austria, Albania, and Algeria walked at the front, followed by representatives from Afghanistan, Burma, and Britain. Vietnamese youth danced national dances in their cars, Egyptian youth held up huge portraits of Nasser, youth from East and West Germany marched together, and American youth, who had come to Moscow despite obstacles, kept shouting "Friendship" and "Peace" in Russian....

The Chinese representatives' vehicle was like a flowerbed, with two colorful dragons on the team. Young men and women waved bouquets and ribbons, singing songs of friendship. The masses shouted at the Chinese delegation: "Moscow—Beijing!" "China—Mao Zedong!"

The Soviet delegation, as the host, walked at the end of the procession, the largest delegation composed of youth from fifteen union republics, dressed in various national costumes, slowly advancing.

Because there were too many welcoming crowds along the way, the special vehicles of the delegations moved very slowly, taking a total of three hours to reach their destination at three o'clock in the afternoon.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, and other Soviet party and government leaders entered the stands, and the audience applauded to welcome them. Then, youth delegations from various countries began to enter the stadium, holding flags of their countries, nationalities, and organizations, waving bouquets and handkerchiefs, singing and dancing, intertwined with cheers and applause from the audience. The whole venue was filled with a joyous atmosphere. Each delegation circled the field once, but with so many delegations, it took two and a half hours.

The Chinese delegation, waving colorful flowers and dancing dragon lanterns, entered the stadium, arousing enthusiastic cheers from the audience. When the Chinese team reached the front of the rostrum, it released colorful balloons, carrying the slogan "For Peace and Friendship," flying into the sky.

The Soviet delegation entered the stadium last, holding high the flags of the fifteen republics, and the entire audience stood up to cheer and applaud. All the delegations converged in the center of the field, and the square became an ocean of fluttering flags and colorful colors.

After five o'clock, the opening ceremony began. Romanovsky, chairman of the Soviet Peace and Friendship Festival Preparatory Committee, delivered a speech, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the people of Moscow to youth representatives from 122 countries. He said, "Let us further consolidate our friendship and strengthen our confidence in defending peace during these fifteen days." Then, youth representatives from the five continents spoke, expressing the desire of global youth for peace and friendship. Then, relay batons transmitted from various routes in Europe and Asia were sent to the venue. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, spoke, extending warm greetings on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people to youth guests from various countries. He said: "Now the attention of world opinion is focused on the Moscow festival, which is no accident. This is because peace is more important than anything else at present. As guests in Moscow, you will have extensive contact with the Soviet people, and you can know that the Soviet people, young and old, sincerely need peace and strive for peace." Voroshilov finally shouted: "I wish the festival success!" "Long live world peace!"

After Voroshilov's speech, more than 20,000 pigeons were released into the venue, flying freely in the venue. At this time, the drums and music were played together. The flag of the Sixth Festival slowly rose, and the world democratic youth anthem was sung over and over again in various languages.

After the break, 8,000 Soviet athletes performed gymnastics, and 2,500 Soviet ballet dancers performed the ballet "Our Youth Blossoms Like Flowers" for the youth representatives.

When the ballet began, young artists from fifteen union republics appeared on the green square like wildflowers on the grassland. The dances of the fifteen union republics each had their own characteristics, and almost every change in formation aroused countless applause. Then, 8,000 gymnasts collectively performed parallel bars, horizontal bars, rattan circles, and acrobatic movements on the vast field. Finally, in the clear and melodious music, a golden yellow appeared on the square, and the athletes used the undulating movements of their bare arms to show a rolling wheat field. In an instant, the music changed, playing a heavy and terrifying tune, and a black atomic bomb appeared in the golden wheat field. But the athletes put two thick bars on this bomb represented by a black flag. The microphone emitted a loud "No!" At this time, the ocean and maps of the five continents appeared on the square, as well as white peace doves, and the words "Peace" written in Russian, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Indian, and other languages, and the emblem of this festival. The crowd in the stands opposite the rostrum used flags to spell out the words "For Peace and Friendship." (Attached picture)

    和平友谊洋溢　美丽青春开花
    世界青年联欢节隆重开幕
    本报莫斯科28日电　第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节今天在莫斯科开幕。莫斯科充满了青春和平和友好气氛。这些天来，世界各国青年代表们从天南地北汇合到莫斯科来。今天他们又从莫斯科各个角落集中到列宁山下中央运动场，在这里举行隆重开幕式。
    上午十点钟左右，122个国家的青年代表团在莫斯科东北区全苏工农业展览会门前会师。十一点四十五分，上万人的各国青年队伍乘着几百辆汽车，由高举着和平鸽旗帜、联欢节旗帜和吹奏着和平号角的摩托车队为前导，浩浩荡荡沿着十六公里长的幸福路向着市西南区的中央运动场进发。一百多万莫斯科市民夹道欢迎，不断高呼“和平—友谊”和“乌拉”的口号。他们有的站在屋顶上，有的站在大桥上，每一个窗口上都站满了人。
    各国青年代表都穿着不同的民族服装，吹奏着乐器，举着旗帜，挥着手巾和鲜花。澳大利亚、奥地利、阿尔巴尼亚和阿尔及利亚的代表走在最前面，跟着是阿富汗、缅甸和英国的代表，越南的青年在车上跳着民族舞蹈，埃及的青年高举着巨大的纳赛尔的画像，民主德国和西德青年在一起前进，不顾阻挠来到莫斯科的美国青年不停地用俄语喊着“友谊”、“和平”……。
    中国代表的车子有如一座花坛，车队上是两条彩龙，男女青年挥舞着花束和彩带，高唱着友谊的歌曲。群众向中国代表团高呼：“莫斯科—北京！”“中国—毛泽东！”
    作为主人的苏联代表团走在队伍的最后，这是由十五个加盟共和国的青年组成的最大的代表团，他们穿着各种民族服装，缓缓前进。
    沿途因为欢迎的群众太多，各国代表团的专车进行的很慢，路上一共走了三个钟头，直到下午三点钟才到达目的地。
    下午三点钟，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫等苏联党政领导人员进入看台，全场鼓掌欢迎。接着各国青年代表队开始入场，他们举着自己国家、民族、团体的旗帜，摇着花束和手帕，唱着歌，跳着舞，和观众的欢呼声和鼓掌声交织在一起。全场洋溢着欢乐的气氛。每个代表队绕场一周，但是队伍这样的多，足足走了两个半钟点。
    中国代表团挥着五彩花朵、舞着龙灯入场，引起全场热烈的欢呼。中国队走到主席台前面的时候，放出五彩的气球，带着“为了和平和友谊”的标语飞上天空。
    苏联代表队最后入场，他们高举着十五个共和国的国旗，全场都起立欢呼鼓掌。所有的代表队汇合到场中心，广场上变成了旗帜飘扬和五彩缤纷的海洋。
    五点以后，开幕式开始了。苏联和平联欢节筹备委员会主席罗曼诺夫斯基致词，代表莫斯科人向来自122个国家的青年代表表示热烈的欢迎，他说：“让我们在十五天的时间里更加巩固我们的友谊，加强我们保卫和平的信心。”接着五大洲的青年代表发言，他们都表示了全球青年对于和平和友谊的愿望。然后从欧亚两洲各路传来的接力棒送到了会场。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫讲了话，他代表苏联最高苏维埃和苏联人民向来自各国的青年客人致以热烈的敬礼。他说：“现在世界舆论的注意力都集中在莫斯科的联欢节上，这不是偶然的。这是因为目前和平重于一切。你们在莫斯科作客，你们将与苏联人广泛接触，你们可以知道苏联人，无论老少都衷心需要和平、为和平而奋斗。”伏罗希洛夫最后高呼：“祝联欢节成功！”“全世界和平万岁！”
    伏罗希洛夫讲话之后，会场上放出了两万多只鸽子，在会场上自由地飞翔。这时候，鼓乐声齐奏。第六届联欢节的旗帜徐徐地升起，全场用各国语言一遍又一遍唱起了世界民主青年进行曲。
    大会休息以后，八千名苏联运动员作了体操表演，二千五百名苏联芭蕾舞演员为青年代表们表演了芭蕾舞“我们的青春像鲜花一样开放”。
    芭蕾舞开始时，十五个加盟共和国的青年艺术家们像草原上的鲜花一样出现在绿色的广场上。十五个加盟共和国的舞蹈各有特色，几乎每一次队形的变化都要引起无数掌声。跟着八千名体操运动员们在广阔的场地上集体表演了单杠、双杠、藤圈和机巧运动。最后在清越嘹亮的音乐中，广场上出现了一片金黄色，运动员们用光着的手臂的起伏动作表现出一片麦浪翻滚。刹那间音乐变换了，奏出了沉重恐怖的曲调，金黄的麦田里出现了一颗黑色的原子弹。但是运动员们在这个用黑色旗子表现的炸弹上面打上了两个粗杠。麦克风里发出大声“不！”这时，广场上出现了海洋和五大洲的地图，白色的和平鸽，用俄、英、法、中、西、阿拉伯、印度等多种文字写的“和平”和本届联欢节的会徽。主席台对面的看台上的人群用旗子摆出了“为了和平和友谊”的大字。（附图片）
    开幕式就这样结束了。各国青年代表团向着联欢节会场进发，沿途受到群众热烈欢迎。（塔斯社传真照片）（新华社稿）
