Editor's Note: This Hubei Daily editorial focuses on criticizing the reactionary statements of the landlord class represented by Peng Yihu. Rightist Peng Yihu was the Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee. Before liberation, he was a large landlord in Yueyang, Hunan, and served as the county magistrate of Hengshan Experimental County. He was known for oppressing and exploiting peasants, and the Chiang Kai-shek government praised him as a "model county magistrate." On June 4th, at a symposium of democratic figures convened by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, he pretended to defend the interests of the peasants and complained on their behalf. His main arguments were that "the most serious internal contradiction among the people is the contradiction in the countryside, and the main contradiction in the countryside is the contradiction between the state and the peasants"; "the unified purchase and sale of grain has been a mess"; "peasants are living a life of starvation"; he even slandered, saying: "This Wuhan rectification movement has revealed many scandals. I see that some double-dealing factionalist Communist Party members are no different from thoroughly corrupt Kuomintang members." These reactionary statements of his were refuted by people from all walks of life. Peasants who had been exploited by him used the facts of his past exploitation of peasants to expose his mask.

Rightists like Peng Yihu, who pretend to complain for the peasants, are not unique to Hubei Province. They exist in other provinces and cities as well, and their reactionary statements are representative. Therefore, we are reprinting here the full text of the Hubei Daily editorial criticizing such reactionary statements.

Just as the socialist transformation of agriculture has been victoriously realized, agricultural production is rapidly developing, the lives of peasants are gradually improving, and the vast majority of peasants are marching forward with confidence towards a happy socialism, figures like Peng Yihu, typical representatives of landlords and rich peasants among the bourgeois rightists, are launching vicious attacks on the leadership of the Party and the working class, and on the worker-peasant alliance. They say things like "the most serious internal contradiction among the people is the contradiction in the countryside, and the main contradiction in the countryside is the contradiction between the state and the peasants," and "peasants are living a life of starvation," etc. In a word, they are saying that the Communist Party and the working class-led state have made a complete mess of the countryside. What is the purpose of Peng Yihu and his ilk being so enthusiastic about complaining for the peasants? Are they truly representatives of the interests of the peasants? We might as well study some of the clamoring of the rightists on the peasant issue. True gold fears no fire.

In the past, Peng Yihu and his ilk said that land reform was "a mess," but they themselves have already become embarrassed to sing this old tune again. Therefore, now they have changed to a new tune. Peng Yihu said that the main contradiction among the people is the contradiction between the state and the peasants. This statement is clearly not in accordance with the actual situation. Does the socialist transformation of agriculture represent the interests of the peasants? Has the lives of the peasants improved after collectivization? Is the unified purchase and sale of grain a mess or is it extremely good? These questions have already been answered by the peasant masses and objective facts. The socialist transformation of agriculture was originally intended to create conditions for China's socialist industrialization, to eliminate the system of exploitation and the basis for the emergence of the system of exploitation, to enable peasants to finally get rid of exploitation and poverty, and also to solve the contradictions between the working class and the peasants. Isn't this common sense for the people of our country? How can the contradictions generated between the state and the peasants on the basis of consistent interests be expanded into the main contradiction among the people? Are the peasants unwilling to take the socialist road? No. As everyone knows, from the second half of 1955 to the spring of 1956, in such a short period of time, a socialist upsurge swept across China's countryside. The number of peasant households participating in elementary agricultural cooperatives reached more than 90% of the total number of peasant households, and the number of peasant households participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives reached more than 60% of the total number of peasant households. Why did the vast majority of peasants follow the Communist Party on the socialist road so enthusiastically and orderly in such a short period of time? Because they understood that this was the only way for them to finally get rid of exploitation and poverty and move towards common prosperity. They said that socialism was their "lifeline," and regarded the socialist revolution as the second great liberation after the land reform. This proves that the relationship between the Party and the peasants is closer than in the past, the interests of the state and the peasants are more consistent than in the past on the basis of socialism, and the alliance between the working class and the peasants is also more solid than in the past on the new economic basis.

After collectivization, has agricultural production developed or declined? Has the lives of the peasants improved? "Peasants are living a life of starvation," this is Peng Yihu's argument to exaggerate the contradiction between the state and the peasants. Let's look at 1956, the first year after collectivization, and also the year to test the superiority of the cooperatives. Taking our province as an example, after collectivization, the production enthusiasm of the vast majority of peasants soared to unprecedented levels. The production determination and action of "turning dry ponds into water ponds, and sandy fields into rice paddies," and "the river water overflows the dikes, and the lake water rises to the green mountains" were rarely seen in the past. This production enthusiasm of the peasants has yielded huge results. In 1956, the grain output of our province reached 21 billion jin, 3.5 billion jin more than the highest annual output in history, and 2.2 billion jin more than in 1955, an increase of 11.7%. More than 90% of the agricultural cooperatives in the province increased production, while only 10% of the cooperatives suffered disasters and reduced production. 85% of the members increased their income, only nearly 8% of the members decreased their income, and the rest of the members remained unchanged. Moreover, through the efforts of last winter and this spring, the production-reduced cooperatives and households have been transformed into production-increased cooperatives and households. Not only have the general members increased their income and improved their lives, but even the old, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members have been properly arranged and cared for in terms of production and life. Their lives are also equivalent to the level of ordinary members, living a carefree life. These are all iron facts. Who says that the lives of the peasants have been reduced? This is nothing more than the shameless fabrication of those rightists who hold a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party and socialism, deliberately ignoring the new face of the countryside, obliterating the improvement of peasants' lives, and denying the fruits of the peasants' hard work. Of course, today the living standards of the peasants are generally still very low. However, the vast majority of peasants know very well that to change this situation, they can only rely on their own hard work to gradually seek solutions on the basis of building the country with diligence and thrift and developing production. The peasants of Huangtian Advanced Cooperative in Peng Yihu's hometown of Yueyang, Hunan, compared Peng Yihu's complaints on behalf of the peasants to "a cat crying over a dead mouse," which is very insightful! Because they still remember very clearly Peng Yihu's long-term cruel exploitation. At that time, they often went hungry while farming and working for the Peng family. After liberation, their lives have improved a lot.

Is the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain beneficial to the peasants? Is it a mess or is it extremely good? Here, let's not talk about the superiority of this policy in guaranteeing the rational needs of the people for grain, in supporting industrial construction, in restricting capitalism, and in stabilizing prices. The great flood disaster suffered by our province in 1954 alone is a very good test. In the face of such a great disaster, not only did the price of grain not rise, but the peasants were guaranteed to have grain to eat, and no one starved to death, so that the peasants smoothly survived the disaster. In the old society (such as the great flood of 1931), wouldn't the peasants have to "lose their families and become separated from their wives and children"? How could they restore production and rebuild their homes? "The policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is a life-saving policy," "The great flood that has not been seen in a hundred years, the good government that has not been seen in a thousand years." This is the voice of the vast majority of peasants. Those rightists who are infatuated with feudalism and capitalism, who only care about personal wealth and enjoyment, and who do not care about the life and death of the majority of people, probably do not want to understand these things anyway. Of course, there are shortcomings in the work of unified purchase and sale of grain. For example, there are individual places where too much grain is purchased and too little grain is left, or the supply is too wide and the supply is too small, etc. Therefore, criticism of these shortcomings and demands for improvement of this work are completely correct. This is essentially different from the malicious attacks of the rightists on this policy.

Isn't it very clear who represents the interests of the peasants? Only the Chinese Communist Party and the working class can represent the greatest and most comprehensive interests of the people of the whole country, including their immediate and long-term interests. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. The vast majority of peasants have the deepest understanding of this issue. From the results of the two revolutions in China and the comparison between the new and old societies, they have personally experienced that the Party and the working class share the same breath and destiny with them, and are connected to them by blood. Therefore, they have always placed their future and destiny in the leadership of the Party and the working class. Besides the Communist Party and the working class, which other party, which other class can represent the interests of the peasants and lead the peasants to achieve complete liberation?

Are Peng Yihu and his ilk representing the interests of the peasants by complaining on behalf of the peasants? To be honest, in the old society, they were a big stone pressing on the peasants, they were Huang Shiren in the play "The White-Haired Girl," they threw the peasants into the dark abyss, they turned the peasants into ghosts. Gong Xuchu, a poor peasant in Huangtian, Yueyang, questioned Peng Yihu: His mother used to work in Peng's house, and she only received one and a half liters of rice a day. Why didn't Peng Yihu show some kindness at that time? People like Peng Yihu have received the forgiveness of the peasants and the arrangements of the government today, but they still maintain their past ugly souls. Therefore, everything that the people think is very good, they say is "very bad." What common interests do they have with the peasants? What common feelings and common language do they have with the peasants? What qualifications do they have to complain on behalf of the peasants? However, it is strange to say that Huang Shiren of the past is actually complaining on behalf of the peasants today. This is nothing more than their attempt to incite the peasants to oppose the leadership of the Party and the working class and oppose socialism through this clamoring, so that they can drag our country back to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, and re-live their previous licentious and extravagant life as exploiters. The conspiracy of the rightists is of course in vain. The new type of peasants with socialist consciousness are not unfamiliar with the faces of these masters. Therefore, when the rightists provoke the relationship between the Party and the peasants and attack the Party and socialism, it arouses their great anger. The accusations of Peng Yihu by the peasants of Huangtian, Yueyang, published in this newspaper today are a good example. The peasants fully understand that the rightists' opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and opposition to socialism is digging up the roots of their happy future. They warn the rightists: "Whoever opposes the leadership of the Communist Party, whoever opposes socialism, we will fight him to the death," "We will throw him into the latrine as garbage."

It should be said that the rightists have given us another very good lesson on the road of socialist victory and development. This lesson shows that although the large-scale class struggle has basically ended, it has not completely ended, and class contradictions and the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy still exist seriously. On the road to advancing towards socialism, it is by no means smooth sailing. Those who resist socialist transformation are still waiting for opportunities to attack the working people. Therefore, we must maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance.

The victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution mainly relied on the strong worker-peasant alliance. Under the guidance of the Party and the working class, the peasants have achieved their complete liberation. In the future, the peasants will rely on their own hard work to make great contributions to socialist construction. Although our province suffered disasters last year, it still achieved a bumper harvest. This year, good news is frequently reported. The peasants are using their practical actions to powerfully smash the challenges of the rightists. The labor of the peasants is supremely glorious. The Party and the working class should pay tribute to the working peasants!

    谁是农民利益的代表者？
    ——7月6日湖北日报社论——
    编者按：湖北日报这一社论着重批判了以彭一湖为代表的地主阶级的反动言论。右派分子彭一湖是汉口市人民委员会参事室的副主任。解放前他是湖南岳阳的大地主，当过衡山实验县的县长，由于他压迫农民和剥削农民出了名，蒋介石政府曾表扬他为“模范县长”。6月4日在中共武汉市委召开的民主人士座谈会上，他却装着维护农民利益，替农民叫苦。他的主要论调，是所谓“人民内部矛盾顶严重的是农村的矛盾，而农村矛盾主要又是国家和农民的矛盾”；“粮食统购统销搞坏了”；“农民过着饥饿的生活”；他甚至还诬蔑说：“这次武汉整风运动揭发出许多丑事，我看见有些双料宗派主义的共产党员和腐败透顶的国民党员没有什么不同。”他这一些反动言论，受到各界人民的驳斥。曾经受过他剥削的农民纷纷用他过去剥削农民的事实来揭穿他的假面具。
    像彭一湖这种假装替农民叫苦的右派分子不只是湖北省有，在其他各省市都有，他这种反动言论具有代表性。因此，我们把湖北日报批判这种反动言论的社论，全文转载在这里。
    正当农业社会主义改造已经胜利实现，农业生产已在迅速向前发展，农民生活已在逐步改善，广大农民满怀信心地沿着幸福的社会主义向前迈进的时候，如彭一湖之流，资产阶级右派分子之中的地主、富农的典型代表人物，却向党和工人阶级的领导，向工农联盟进行恶毒的攻击。说什么“人民内部矛盾顶严重的是农村的矛盾，而农村的矛盾主要又是国家和农民的矛盾”，什么“农民过着饥饿的生活”等等。一句话就是说共产党和工人阶级领导的国家把农村搞得一团糟。彭一湖之流这样热心地来替农民叫苦，其目的是为什么呢？他们真正是农民利益的代表者吗？我们不妨就右派分子在农民问题上的一些叫嚣加以研究，是真金就不怕火来炼。
    过去彭一湖之流就说过，土地改革“搞糟了”，但是这个老调子他们自己已经觉得不好意思再唱了。因此，现在换了新的调子。彭一湖说，人民内部的矛盾主要是国家和农民的矛盾。这个说法显然是不符合于实际情况的。农业社会主义改造是不是代表农民利益的？合作化以后农民生活是不是改善了？粮食统购统销是糟透了还是好极了？这些问题原是农民群众和客观事实已经回答了的。农业社会主义改造，本来是为了我国的社会主义工业化创造条件，是为了消灭剥削制度和产生剥削制度的基础，使农民最后摆脱剥削，摆脱贫困，也正是为了解决工人阶级同农民之间的矛盾。这不是我国人民的普通常识吗？怎么会把国家和农民在利益一致的基础上所产生的矛盾，扩大成为人民内部的主要矛盾呢？是农民不愿意走社会主义道路吗？不是。大家知道从1955年的下半年到1956年春季，这样一个短短的时间内，我国农村掀起了社会主义的高潮，参加初级农业社的农户达到了总农户的90％以上，参加高级农业社的农户则达到了总农户的60％以上。广大农民为什么在这样短的时间内，那样热情而又有秩序地跟着共产党走社会主义道路呢？因为他们懂得这是使他们最后摆脱剥削和贫困，走向共同富裕的唯一出路。他们说，社会主义是自己的“命根子”，把社会主义革命看成是土地改革以后的第二次大翻身。这就证明党和农民的关系比过去更加亲密了，国家和农民的利益在社会主义的基础上比过去更加一致了，工人阶级同农民的联盟在新的经济基础上也比过去更加巩固了。
    合作化以后，农业生产是发展了，还是衰退了呢？农民的生活是不是改善了呢？“农民过着饥饿的生活”这是彭一湖夸大国家与农民矛盾的论据。我们看看1956年吧，这是合作化以后的第一年，也是考验合作社的优越性的一年，就从我省来说，合作化以后，广大农民的生产积极性空前高涨，“干塘变水塘，沙畈变米畈”，“江水翻大堤，湖水上青山”的生产决心和行动，是历来少见的。农民的这种生产积极性，收到了巨大的成果，1956年我省的粮食产量达到了二百一十亿斤，比过去历史上的最高年产量还多三十五亿斤，比1955年增产二十二亿斤，即增产11.7％，全省增产的农业社占90％以上，受灾社和减产社只占10％。有85％的社员增加了收入，只有将近8％的社员减少了收入，其余的社员是不增不减。而且经过去冬今春的努力，减产社、减产户，又变成了增产社和增产户。不仅一般的社员增加了收入，改善了生活，而且就连老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的社员，在生产和生活上，也得到了适当的安排和照顾。他们的生活也相当于一般社员的水平，过着无忧无虑的日子。这些都是铁的事实，谁说农民的生活降低了呢？这不过是那些对共产党、对社会主义抱着敌对态度的右派分子，故意无视农村的新面貌，抹煞农民生活的改善情况，否认农民辛勤劳动的成果的无耻捏造。当然，今天农民的生活水平，一般说来还是很低的。但是，广大农民知道得很清楚，要改变这种状况，只有靠自己的辛勤劳动，在勤俭建国、发展生产的基础上，来逐步求得解决，彭一湖的家乡湖南岳阳黄田高级社的农民，把彭一湖替农民叫苦比之为“猫儿哭老鼠”，真是一针见血！因为他们对彭一湖的长期残酷剥削还记得很清楚，那时帮彭家种田做工，还经常挨饿。而解放后，他们的生活已经改善得好多了。
    粮食统购统销政策是不是对农民有利，是糟透了还是好极了呢？这里暂且不说这个政策对于保证人民对粮食的合理需要，对于支援工业建设，对于限制资本主义，对于稳定物价等的优越性，单凭1954年我省所遭受的大水灾，就是一个很好的考验。在那样大的灾害面前，不仅粮食没有涨价，而且保证了农民有粮食吃，没有饿死一个人，使农民顺利地渡过了灾荒。要是在旧社会（如1931年的大水时），农民不是要“倾家荡产”，“妻离子散”吗？那还能恢复生产，重建家园呢。“粮食统购统销政策是救命政策”，“百年未有的大洪水，千年未有的好政府”这是广大农民的声音。那些迷恋封建主义、资本主义、只顾个人发财享受，不顾大多数人死活的右派分子，大概是无论如何也不愿理解这些的。当然，在粮食统购统销工作中，是存在着缺点的，例如，有个别地方购粮过多和留粮过少，或者供应过宽和供应过少等，因此，对于这些缺点的批评和要求改进这项工作，那是完全正确的。这与右派分子对这个政策的恶意攻击是有本质区别的。
    究竟是谁代表农民的利益，这不是十分清楚的吗？只有中国共产党和工人阶级才能够代表全国人民、代表农民最大的全面的利益，包括他们的眼前利益和长远利益，过去和现在是这样，将来也是这样。广大农民对这个问题体会得最深刻，他们从中国两个革命的结果和新旧社会的对比中，亲身体验到党和工人阶级，是与他们同呼吸，共命运的，是和他们血肉相联的，因而他们始终是把自己的前途和命运，寄托在党和工人阶级的领导上。除了共产党和工人阶级以外，还有那一个党派，那一个阶级能够代表农民的利益，能够领导农民获得彻底的解放呢？
    彭一湖之流代替农民叫苦，是代表农民利益的吗？说实话，在旧社会他们正是压在农民身上的一个大石头，正是剧本“白毛女”中的黄世仁，是他们把农民抛到了黑暗的深渊，是他们把农民变成了鬼。岳阳黄田贫农龚绪初质问彭一湖，他的母亲过去在彭家做工，一天只有一升半米，为什么彭一湖当时不发发善心呢？像彭一湖这些人，今天得到了农民的宽恕和政府的安排，但他们仍然保持着过去的丑恶灵魂。因此，凡是人民群众认为好得很的事情，他们则说是“糟得很”。他们同农民的利益有什么一致的地方呢？他们同农民有什么共同感情和共同语言呢？他们又有什么资格代表农民叫苦呢？然而说也奇怪，过去的黄世仁却居然在今天代表农民叫起苦来了。这不过是他们企图通过这种叫嚣，煽动农民起来反对党和工人阶级的领导，反对社会主义，好让他们把我们国家拖回到半封建、半殖民地的老路上去，重新过着他们从前那种荒淫无耻，挥霍无度的剥削者的生活。右派分子的这种阴谋诡计，当然是徒劳的。新型的、具有社会主义觉悟的农民，对于这些老爷们的脸谱并不生疏。因此，当着右派分子挑拨党和农民的关系，向党、向社会主义进攻的时候，就引起了他们极大的愤怒。今天本报发表的岳阳黄田农民对彭一湖的控诉就是一个很好的例子。农民完全懂得，右派分子反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，就是挖掉他们的幸福前途的根子，他们警告右派分子说：“谁要反对共产党的领导，谁要反对社会主义，我们就要同他拚命”，“就要把他当作垃圾抛到茅坑里去”。
    应该说，在社会主义胜利发展的道路上，右派分子又给我们上了很好的一次课。这一课说明，大规模的阶级斗争虽然基本结束，但并没有完全结束，阶级矛盾、敌我矛盾仍然严重存在。在向社会主义前进的道路上，绝不是风平浪静的，反抗社会主义改造的分子还在伺机向劳动人民进攻，因此我们要保持高度的革命警惕性。
    民主主义革命和社会主义革命的胜利，主要是依靠了强大的工农联盟。农民在党和工人阶级的指导下，获得了自己的彻底解放。今后农民对于社会主义的建设，又将依靠自己的辛勤劳动，作出巨大的贡献。去年我省虽有灾害，仍然获得了大丰收，今年又是捷报频传，农民们用自己的实际行动，有力的粉碎着右派分子的挑战。农民的劳动是无上光荣的，党和工人阶级应向劳动农民致敬！
