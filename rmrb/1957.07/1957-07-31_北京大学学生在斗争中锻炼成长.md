Peking University Students Temper Themselves and Grow in Struggle
Chairman of the Peking University Student Union Zhao Zhenjiang

    For more than two months, students at Peking University have been engaged in a fierce struggle with right-wing elements. Today, we have achieved a great victory. We have defeated the right-wing and learned skills.
    Betraying the "May Fourth Spirit," Upholding Revolutionary Traditions
    The right-wing elements at Peking University and the right-wing elements in society are "birds of a feather" and "of the same lineage." Their goal is to overthrow the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, and to restore capitalism. However, their methods and characteristics of activity are somewhat different. The right-wing elements at Peking University, in this rampant attack, initially acted under the banner of "inheriting the May Fourth tradition," shouting slogans of "democracy" and "freedom." They used these flowery words to incite and confuse students, attempting to fish in troubled waters to achieve their political conspiracy. However, Peking University students with a glorious revolutionary tradition understand what the real "May Fourth tradition" is – it is a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary tradition, it is following the Party, it is the tradition of the left-wing intellectuals after the May Fourth Movement increasingly integrating with the workers and peasants. Comrade Deng Zhongxia, as a representative of Peking University students, was a model of this tradition. Since then, for decades, the broad masses of progressive students at Peking University have always held high the banner of the "May Fourth tradition," united with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party, to oppose the three great enemies, to fight for liberation, for democracy, and for freedom, advancing wave upon wave, fighting heroically, until the victory of the national revolution. This tradition today is embodied in consolidating the achieved fruits of the revolutionary victory, safeguarding the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, and pushing our country towards the most beautiful and ideal communist society. We deeply understand that this is the greatest and most fundamental interest of our young students and the people of the whole country. The right-wing elements, under the guise of promoting the "May Fourth tradition," attempted to overthrow the leadership of the Party, overthrow the socialist system, and undermine socialist democracy. The issue is very clear; they are traitors to the "May Fourth Spirit," and enemies of the young students and the people of the whole country.
    The right-wing elements attempted to win over the self-esteem of young students and exploit the patriotic spirit, a tradition of Chinese youth, to incite and create confusion. Our broad masses of students saw through the conspiracy of the right-wing elements, exposed their ugly faces, and waged a resolute struggle against these traitors to the "May Fourth" spirit.
    Crushing the Fallacies of the Right-Wing Elements, Further Mastering Marxism-Leninism
    In this movement, the right-wing elements at Peking University transported various "theories" from international imperialism, revisionism, and right-leaning opportunists to attack us. In order to conceal their reactionary conspiracies and confuse the masses, these right-wing elements attacked Marxism-Leninism under the guise of "anti-dogmatism"; used the banner of "opposing the three evils" to oppose the leadership of the Party; and put forward slogans of "fighting for democracy and freedom" and "the dictatorship of the proletariat is outdated," plotting to overthrow our country's socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship. As Chairman Mao said: "Revisionists, right-leaning opportunists, also mouth Marxism, they also attack 'dogmatism,' but what they attack is precisely the most fundamental things of Marxism."
    Tan Tianrong, a vanguard of the right-wing elements among Peking University students, declared: "After 1895, Marxism, according to the iron historical necessity, transformed into its own opposite (the first negation), correspondingly forming the absolute rule of mutual penetration of revisionism and dogmatism in the international communist movement for sixty-two years." He used this to negate Marxism, especially attempting to negate Leninism. However, the glorious history – the iron facts – of the international communist movement and the development of Marxism forcefully refuted Tan Tianrong's fallacy. Everyone knows that after Engels' death in 1895, although a few leaders of the Second International fell into the quagmire of revisionism, true revolutionary Marxism was always developing in struggle. It achieved a great victory through the October Revolution, and Lenin and the Soviet Communist Party developed it. Later, China and various people's democratic countries, under its guidance, all achieved revolutionary victories, and enriched and developed it with the experience of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. Today, its brilliance is even more radiant, illuminating the whole world.
    During the movement, Tan Tianrong also initiated the organization of reactionary groups such as the "Hegel-Engels School" and the "Hundred Flowers Society," spreading these things everywhere under the guise of "theoretical exploration." He maliciously mixed the idealist philosopher and the founder of dialectical materialism, Engels, together. His purpose was to confuse the boundaries between the idealist and materialist systems and eliminate the struggle between idealism and materialism. He put Engels and Hegel together, and left out Marx, also with an obvious purpose: he was attempting to negate Marx, and then to negate Marxism. He slandered "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" as "naked idealism," and said that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riot was a "manifestation of anti-dogmatism," while after the Hungarian working class and patriotic people suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, it caused "this movement to transform into its own opposite." In short, under the guise of "anti-dogmatism," he spared no effort to attack Marxism-Leninism by all means, attempting to fundamentally dig out the foundation of the Party's leadership of socialism. Therefore, a student wrote a short poem, "What a Tan Tianrong," to appropriately depict Tan Tianrong's reactionary words and deeds: "The right-wing banner is hung high, using Kautsky's thread to sew together Engels' words, Tan Tianrong's trick, caters to Chiang Kai-shek's tastes."
    Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, no victory of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Party is the core force leading our people forward. Precisely because of this, the right-wing elements, like all enemies, desperately attacked our Party. The right-wing element Huang Jizhong extremely shamelessly slandered the Party spirit of the Communist Party as "strangling" human nature, saying that "Party members have no humanity," vainly attempting to shake our trust in the Party and split the unity of our Party, and then overthrow the leadership of the Party. But the right-wing elements miscalculated. Their rumors and slanders cannot separate our flesh-and-blood relationship with the Party. All the teachers and students in our school crushed the right-wing elements' fallacies that slandered our Party. We say that in a class society, there has never been abstract, non-class human nature. When people talk about human nature, what they talk about is either the human nature of this class or the human nature of that class, either praising the human nature of this class or hating the human nature of that class. There is no super-class human nature in the world. Since political parties are representatives of the interests of various classes, class nature, Party spirit, and human nature are unified. Now, there is only the human nature of the bourgeoisie or the human nature of the proletariat. The profit-seeking essence of capitalism causes the relationship between people to only be naked self-interest. The bourgeoisie has no so-called real human nature. The proletariat is the most advanced and selfless class. It wants to completely eliminate all exploitation and liberate all mankind. Therefore, only the class nature of the proletariat and the concentrated embodiment of this class nature – the Party spirit of the Communist Party – determine that the human nature of the proletariat is the noblest and most beautiful. The Communist Party members who are hated by the right-wing elements such as Huang Jizhong, starting from the bourgeoisie's vile and ugly human nature, are precisely those who possess noble and beautiful human nature. They serve the people wholeheartedly and work tirelessly, dedicating themselves to the great cause of communism, and are willing to sacrifice their lives for the interests of the broad masses of people. The history and reality of the Communist Party and many vivid examples have proved this. It is precisely the Party spirit of the Communist Party that requires its members to have such lofty human nature. Party spirit not only does not suppress and strangle human nature, but on the contrary, raises people's human nature to an unprecedented height and motivates people to do the most lofty undertakings that ordinary people cannot do.
    The spearhead of the attack by the right-wing elements at Peking University also pointed to the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to fundamentally negate our country's people's democratic dictatorship. Revolutionary experience and practice tell us that the people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to protect the people and oppose the enemy, and is the guarantee for our building socialism. What we cherish is precisely what the right-wing elements oppose. The right-wing elements viciously slandered our anti-reactionary campaign, shouting "injustice" for the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique… all with the aim of opposing our country's people's democratic dictatorship. In order to realize this conspiracy, they first obliterated the class struggle. Long Yinghua, a Communist Party traitor and right-wing element, openly put forward the fallacy that "the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat is outdated" and "class struggle no longer exists." In fact, the frantic attacks on the Party and socialism by these right-wing elements are the instigation of a class struggle. He released this "smoke screen of peace" to make us lay down our weapons. Long Yinghua also claimed that "the interests of imperialism and socialism are consistent in the face of hydrogen bombs," advocating inviting Dulles to "contend" with us, and so on. These clichés are nothing new, but merely a replica of the notorious "theory of class reconciliation" of revisionism, the purpose of which is to obliterate the class struggle in the world, blur the fundamental opposition between the two camps of imperialism and socialism, attempt to make the working people of various countries content with the internal and external oppression and enslavement of the international monopoly bourgeoisie, and attempt to make our country abolish the people's democratic dictatorship. How ugly Long Yinghua's face is! So, students call him "a clown of the bourgeoisie, an echo of revisionism, a traitor to the Communist Party, and a deserter from the revolutionary ranks."
    Under the powerful exposure and rebuttal of the broad masses of teachers and students in our school, the reactionary fallacies of the right-wing elements have all been crushed, and their reactionary essence has been exposed without reservation. In this struggle, the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism has been proven again, and through this anti-rightist struggle, we have further mastered this invincible magic weapon.
    The Class Background and Ideological Roots of the Right-Wing Elements
    In this anti-rightist struggle, we used the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis to find out the class background and ideological roots of these right-wing elements, and deeply realized their reactionary essence. Most of the right-wing elements among Peking University students came from reactionary class families such as landlords and bureaucrats. After the overthrow of the exploiting classes, they did not abandon their reactionary class stance, nor did they thoroughly transform themselves. The exploiting class ideology was still deeply buried in their souls, sprouting at all times. Taking advantage of the Party's rectification movement and the big "blooming and contending," their dying decadent class sentiments and their deep-seated hatred for the people, the Party, and socialism were all concentratedly exposed. Let us dissect the situation of Chen Fengxiao, Long Yinghua, Zhang Yuanxun, Cui Defu, and other fifteen backbone members of the "Plaza" reactionary group, a stronghold of right-wing elements among Peking University students: 1. Judging from the family background of these people, eleven of them came from exploiting class families such as landlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists, accounting for 75% of the fifteen people; 2. Judging from the situation of their relatives, six people (accounting for 40%) had direct relatives who were sentenced to death by the People's Government; 3. Judging from their political quality, 27% were purged for infiltrating the Party and Youth League organizations; 4. Judging from the moral quality of these people, 14% were hooligans and thieves; in addition, there were also counter-revolutionaries like Liu Qidi who were leniently released by the People's Government. They are the dregs of the old society and the garbage of the new society.
    Although these people are only young people in their twenties, and they have also received seven or eight years of education in the new society, because they stubbornly refuse to give up the interests of the dying class, and are willing to be buried with the exploiting class, they are incompatible with the new society. They hate everything and want to destroy everything. Let's take a look at the sentiments of two other right-wing elements. Yan Zhongqiang, a right-wing element from a landlord and bureaucrat family whose father was a Kuomintang politician, believes that he is living in a "pile of dead people." He gritted his teeth and cursed Party members, Youth League members, and all upright people. He said, "If I am going to die, I will hold you to die with me. If I am going to be electrocuted, I will touch the electricity with one hand and hold you with the other." What a decadent and ugly soul this is! They have an irreconcilable hatred with the people and the Party. How can they be compatible with socialism?
    From the above, it is not difficult to see why they have such deep-seated hatred for the Party and the people. This is their class background and ideological roots for opposing the Party and opposing socialism.
    In addition, there are also a very small number of right-wing elements who have become ambitious and degenerate into bourgeois right-wingers due to the extreme development of bourgeois individualism. Tan Tianrong, a traitor to the Communist Youth League and a right-wing element, is a typical example. He did not accept the education of the Party and Youth League organizations, did not carry out self-transformation, and allowed his own wrong ideas to grow day by day, developing into extremely serious individualism and unbelievable megalomania. He was dissatisfied with reality and disregarded everything. He spared no effort to raise his own status. But when these desires and ambitions could not be satisfied, he developed from dissatisfaction with the new society to negating the new society itself, and ideologically and emotionally stood against the Party and socialism. After the start of the rectification movement, the bourgeois right-wing launched a frantic attack on the Party and society. Seeing an opportunity, he immediately responded. At this point, Tan Tianrong degenerated into the vanguard of the bourgeois right-wing. His path of development is a very shameful path.
    The above two aspects of facts raise a very noteworthy question for us: How important it is for young students from exploiting class backgrounds and with bourgeois individualism and petty-bourgeois arrogance to abandon their class stand, learn from workers and peasants, combine with the people, and use Marxism-Leninism to transform themselves!
    Summarizing Experiences, Learning Lessons
    Peking University students experienced a severe test in this great storm and learned a lot, including fighting experience, but also serious lessons. What is particularly thought-provoking is: Why did the right-wing elements set their sights on college students at the beginning of launching an attack on the Party and socialism? Why did they try to ignite the fire first among the students and use the students as "cannons"? Why did they find some fellow travelers among the students? Why could some students not withstand the impact of the great storm and the deception of the smoke screen, and were confused when the smoke of gunpowder rose, and even waved the flag and shouted for the right-wing? Why did some students hold an objectivist attitude in this class struggle? ... Marxism-Leninism tells us that external causes always work through internal causes. Aren't the above lessons worth all the students in the country examining themselves, finding out this internal cause, and drawing lessons from it? In the process of the anti-rightist struggle, some Peking University students who had been deceived by the right-wing have gradually realized their weaknesses and the reasons for being deceived. Everyone believes that the root cause is still the issue of stance, mainly because these students' stance issues have not been completely resolved, the communist outlook on life has not been fully established, and there are still various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. We say that people are divided into left, center, and right factions in politics, not based on people's subjective wishes. This is an objective reality. All people's important words and deeds inevitably reflect their certain class viewpoints, that is to say, they must start from a certain stance. Precisely because of this, we must use the method of class analysis to look at problems. In this political movement, many facts tell us that the right-wing elements are looking for fellow travelers who oppose the Party and socialism, precisely because they like those whose stances and viewpoints are vague and wavering. These people will inevitably be deceived. This political struggle has given us a vivid and profound political lesson, educating and awakening these students, so that they gradually recognized the direction in the great storm, and began to turn from right to left, and later joined the ranks of the battle.
    This great storm, for us young students who have not experienced much and are not yet mature politically, is indeed a severe test and a baptism of battle. The broad masses of students have been tempered and grown in this struggle.

    北京大学学生在斗争中锻炼成长
    北京大学学生会主席　赵震江
    两个多月以来，北京大学同学一直与右派分子进行着激烈的斗争。到今天，我们已经取得了巨大的胜利。我们击溃了右派，学到了本领。
    反对“五四精神”的叛徒，保持革命传统
    北大的右派分子和社会上的右派分子是“一丘之貉”，是“一脉相传”的，他们的目的都是为了推翻党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，使资本主义复辟。但他们的活动手法和特点有所不同。北大右派分子在这次猖狂进攻中，开始活动的特点是打着“继承五四传统”的旗帜，高喊着“民主”、“自由”的口号。他们用这些花言巧语，来煽动和迷惑同学，以图混水摸鱼，达到其政治阴谋，但是具有革命光荣传统的北大同学，懂得什么是真正的“五四传统”——它是彻底的反帝反封建的革命传统，是跟着党走、是五四运动后左翼知识分子日益与工农群众相结合的传统。当年北大学生以邓中夏同志为代表就是这一传统的典范。以后，几十年来北大广大进步同学一直高举着“五四传统”的旗帜，在共产党的领导下，和全国人民团结一致，为反对三大敌人，为争取解放、争取民主、自由，前仆后继，英勇奋斗，直到全国革命胜利。这种传统到今天体现为巩固已取得的革命胜利成果，维护党的领导和社会主义制度，把我国推向最美好的，最理想的共产主义社会。我们深深地懂得这是我们青年学生和全国人民的最大的、最根本的利益。右派分子打着发扬“五四传统”的招牌，企图推翻党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，断送社会主义民主，问题很显然，他们是“五四精神”的叛徒，是青年学生和全国人民的敌人。
    右派分子企图用迎合青年学生自尊心的办法，利用中国青年学生的爱国的传统精神，进行煽动，制造混乱。我们广大同学识破了右派分子的阴谋，揭穿了他们的丑恶面目，与这些“五四”精神的叛徒进行了坚决斗争。
    粉碎右派分子谬论，进一步掌握马列主义
    在这次运动中，北大右派分子从国际帝国主义、修正主义和右倾机会主义者那里贩运来了种种“理论”，向我们进攻，这些右派分子为了掩盖自己的反动阴谋和迷惑群众，在“反教条主义”的幌子下进攻马克思列宁主义；利用“反对三害”的旗帜反对党的领导；提出“争取民主自由”和“无产阶级专政已经过时”的口号，阴谋推翻我国社会主义制度和人民民主专政。这正如毛主席所说的：“修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’，但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”
    北大学生中右派分子的急先锋谭天荣宣称：“1895年以后，马克思主义按着铁的历史必然性转化为自身的反面（第一次否定），与此相适应的是国际共产主义运动中形成相互渗透的修正主义与教条主义六十二年的绝对统治。”他以此来否定马克思主义，特别是企图否定列宁主义。但是国际共产主义运动和马克思主义发展的光荣历史——铁的事实，却有力地驳斥了谭天荣的谬论。谁都知道，1895年恩格斯逝世以后，尽管第二国际少数领袖，坠入修正主义的泥潭，然而真正革命的马克思主义始终是在斗争中发展着。通过十月革命而取得了伟大胜利，列宁和苏联共产党发展了它。后来，中国和各人民民主国家，在它的指导下，都取得了革命的胜利，并用革命斗争和社会主义建设的经验充实和发展了它。今天，它的光辉更加灿烂，普照着全世界。
    在运动中，谭天荣还曾发起组织“黑格尔——恩格斯学派”和“百花学社”等反动社团，以“理论探讨”作招牌四处散布这些东西。他恶意地把唯心主义哲学家和辩证唯物主义的奠基人恩格斯搅在一起，他的目的是想混淆唯心主义和唯物主义两大体系的界限，取消唯心主义和唯物主义的斗争。他把恩格斯和黑格尔混在一起，而且撇开马克思，其目的也是很明显的，他是企图否定马克思，进而否定马克思主义。他污蔑“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”是“赤裸裸的唯心主义”，他说匈牙利反革命暴乱是“反教条主义的表现”，而匈牙利工人阶级和爱国人民镇压了反革命暴乱以后，却使“这个运动转化为自身的反面”。总之，他在“反教条主义”的幌子下不惜用一切手段向马列主义进攻，企图从根本上挖掉党领导社会主义的墙脚。所以，一个同学写了一首“好个谭天荣”的短诗，对谭天荣的反动言行给以恰当的描绘：“右字大旗，高高挂起，考茨基的针线，缝起恩格斯的词句，谭天荣的把戏，投了蒋介石的脾气”。
    没有共产党就没有新中国、没有我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利，党是领导我国人民前进的核心力量。正因为这样，右派分子和一切敌人一样，拚命向我们党进攻。右派分子黄继忠极端无耻地污蔑共产党的党性是“扼杀”人性的，说“党员没有人性”，妄想动摇我们对党的信任，分裂我们党的团结，进而推翻党的领导。但是右派分子估计错了，他们的造谣污蔑是分不开我们和党的血肉关系的。我们全校师生粉碎了右派分子污蔑我们党的谬论。我们说，在阶级社会里，从来没有抽象的、非阶级的人性。当人们谈论人性时，他们所谈的不是这个阶级的人性就是那个阶级的人性，不是赞美这个阶级的人性就是憎恶这个阶级的人性，世界上没有超阶级的人性。各政党既然是各阶级利益的代表者，所以说阶级性、党性和人性三者是统一的。现在，只有资产阶级的人性或无产阶级的人性。资本主义唯利是图的本质造成人与人之间的关系只能是赤裸裸的利害关系，资产阶级无所谓真正的人性。无产阶级是最先进、最大公无私的阶级，他要彻底消灭一切剥削，要解放全人类，因此只有无产阶级的阶级性以及这种阶级性的集中体现——共产党的党性，才决定无产阶级的人性是最高尚最优美的。右派分子黄继忠等从资产阶级的卑鄙丑恶的人性出发，所憎恨的共产党员，正是具有高尚、优美人性的人。他们忠心耿耿、任劳任怨的为人民服务，他们为了伟大的共产主义事业，为了广大人民的利益，鞠躬尽瘁不惜牺牲自己的生命。共产党的历史和现实生活中许许多多活生生的例子都证明了这些。正是共产党的党性才要求他的党员具有这样崇高的人性，党性不但不压抑和扼杀人性，相反的是使人们的人性升到前所未有的高度，推动人去作常人所不能作的最崇高的事业。
    北大右派分子的进攻矛头还指向无产阶级专政的理论，企图从根本上否定我国的人民民主专政。革命经验和实践告诉我们，人民民主专政是保护人民，反对敌人的有力武器，是我们建设社会主义的保证。我们所珍贵的正是右派分子所反对的。右派分子恶毒地污蔑我们的肃反斗争，为胡风反革命喊“冤”……目的都是为了反对我国的人民民主专政。他们为了实现这一阴谋，首先抹煞阶级斗争，共产党叛徒、右派分子龙英华公然提出了“无产阶级专政的口号已经过时”、“阶级斗争已不存在了”的谬论。实际上他们这些右派分子向党向社会主义的疯狂进攻的本身，就是挑起了一场阶级斗争。他放这个“粉饰太平”的烟幕，是想要我们放下武器。龙英华还宣称“帝国主义和社会主义在氢弹面前利益是一致的”，主张请杜勒斯和我们“争鸣”，诸如此类。这些滥调并没有什么新的东西，不过是修正主义的臭名彰著的“阶级调和论”的翻版，其目的是抹煞世界范围的阶级斗争，模糊帝国主义和社会主义两大阵营的根本对立，企图使各国劳动人民安于国际垄断资产阶级对内和对外的压迫和奴役，企图使我国取消人民民主专政。龙英华的面目是多么丑恶，所以同学们称他是“资产阶级的跳梁小丑，修正主义的应声虫，共产党的叛徒，革命队伍的逃兵”。
    在我校广大师生的有力揭露和驳斥之下，右派分子的反动谬论已全部被粉碎，它的反动本质已暴露无遗。在这次斗争中再次证明了马列主义的无限生命力，并且通过这次反右派的斗争也使我们进一步掌握了这一战无不胜的法宝。
    右派分子的阶级背景和思想根源
    在这次反右派斗争中，我们运用马列主义关于阶级分析的方法，找出了这些右派分子的阶级背景和思想根源，深刻地认识到他们的反动本质。北大学生中的右派分子，大多数出身于地主官僚等反动阶级家庭，剥削阶级被推翻后，他们没有抛弃反动阶级立场，没有彻底改造自己，剥削阶级思想还深深地埋在他们的灵魂深处，时刻萌发，趁着党的整风运动和大“鸣”大“放”的机会，他们的垂死的没落阶级情调和对人民对党对社会主义的刻骨的仇恨都集中的暴露出来。我们解剖一下北大学生中右派分子的据点“广场”反动集团骨干分子陈奉孝、龙英华、张元勋、崔德甫等十五人的情况：一、从这些人的家庭出身来看，他们之中有十一个人出身于地主官僚资本家等剥削阶级家庭，占十五人的75％；二、从他们的亲属关系的情况来看，有六个人（占40％）的直系亲属中有被人民政府判处死刑的；三、从他们的政治品质来看，因混入党团组织被清洗的占27％；四、从这些人的道德品质来看，其中流氓盗窃分子占14％；另外他们之中还有像刘奇弟那样被人民政府宽大释放的反革命分子，他们是旧社会的渣滓，是新社会的垃圾。
    这些人虽然都还不过是二十多岁的青年，他们在新社会也受了七、八年的教育，但由于他们死不肯放弃垂死阶级的利益，甘愿为剥削阶级殉葬。因此他们与新社会格格不入。他们仇恨一切，想毁灭一切。我们再看一下另外两个右派分子的情调。地主官僚家庭出身、父亲是国民党政客的右派分子严仲强，他认为自己是活在“死人堆”里，他咬牙切齿的咒骂党员、团员和一切正直的人们。他说，“我如果要死，也要抱着你们一块死。我要触电，一手摸电，一手也要抱住你们。”这是多么没落、丑恶的灵魂啊！他们与人民与党有不共戴天之仇，怎么能与社会主义相投？
    从以上，就不难看出他们为什么对党对人民这样刻骨的仇恨，这就是他们反党反社会主义的阶级背景和思想根源。
    另外，也有极少数的右派分子是由于资产阶级个人主义的极度发展，成为野心家，堕为资产阶级右派的。共青团叛徒、右派分子谭天荣就是典型的例子。他不接受党团组织的教育，不进行自我改造，听任自己的错误思想日益滋长，一直发展为极端严重的个人主义和令人难以置信的妄狂自大。他不满现实，目空一切，他不惜用一切手段来抬高自己的身份。但当他这些欲望和野心不能得到满足时，他便从对新社会的不满发展到否定新社会本身，并在思想情绪上与党与社会主义对立起来。整风运动开始后，资产阶级右派向党向社会疯狂进攻，他见有机可乘，立即响应。至此，谭天荣堕为资产阶级右派的急先锋。他的发展道路是一条十分可耻的道路。
    以上两方面的事实，向我们提出了一个非常值得注意的问题：剥削阶级出身和具有资产阶级个人主义以及小资产阶级狂妄性的青年学生，放弃自己的阶级立场，向工农学习，与人民结合，用马克思列宁主义来改造自己是多么重要！
    总结经验，记取教训
    北大同学在这次大风浪中经历了一番严重的考验，学到了不少的东西，其中有斗争经验但也有严重的教训。特别值得令人深思的是：为什么右派在向党向社会主义发动进攻的一开始就看中了高等学校的大学生？为什么他们企图首先在学生中点火，利用学生作“炮筒子”？为什么他们在同学中找到了某些同路人？为什么有的同学经不起大风浪的冲击和烟幕弹的蒙蔽，硝烟起处竟受到了迷惑，甚至为右派摇旗呐喊？为什么有的同学在这场阶级斗争中抱着客观主义态度？……马列主义告诉我们外因总是通过内因起作用的。以上教训难道不值得我们全国同学都检查一下自己，找出这个内因，引以为戒吗？在反右派斗争的过程中，北大有些上过右派当的同学，已逐渐认识到自己的弱点和所以上当的原因。大家认为归根到底还是立场问题，主要还是因为这些同学的立场问题还没有彻底解决，共产主义人生观还没有完全树立起来，还存在着形形色色的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想。我们说人们在政治上分成左、中、右三派，并不是根据人们的主观愿望来决定的，这是客观存在的情况，人们一切重要的言行必然反映了自己一定的阶级观点的，也就是说必然从一定的立场出发的，也正因此，我们必须用阶级分析的方法看问题。在这次政治运动中，许多事实告诉我们，右派分子物色反党反社会主义的同路人，正是喜欢这些立场观点模糊、动摇的人，这些人必然会上当。这次政治斗争给我们上了一堂生动的深刻的政治课，教育和惊醒了这些同学，使他们在大风浪中渐渐认清了方向，从右开始向左转，后来并投入了战斗的行列。
    这次大风浪，对我们这些经历不广，政治上还不成熟的青年学生来说，的确是一次严重的考验，是一次战斗的洗礼。广大同学在这次斗争中得到锻炼和成长。
