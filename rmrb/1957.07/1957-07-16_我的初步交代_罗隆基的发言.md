I am a person of the People's Republic of China who has committed a crime. My recent words and deeds have committed the crime of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. Today, I stand on this solemn platform to bow my head and confess my guilt to all of you representatives, to bow my head and confess my guilt to the people of the whole country.

Since liberation, the Party and the people have taken great care of me. I have held relatively high and important positions in state organs and people's organizations. Standing in such a position, having anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, my bad influence is even greater, and my guilt is even more serious.

Now, after this anti-rightist struggle, I feel ashamed to the point of being unable to show my face. Today, I suddenly realize my errors and am willing to use today's me to fight against yesterday's me, to expose my own sins.

First, my speech at the United Front Department symposium on May 22nd had the responsibility of provoking and inciting the recent rampant attacks on the Party by rightists, even reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, across the country. On May 22nd, at the United Front Department symposium, I proposed to establish a committee composed of members of the Communist Party, democratic parties, and other relevant parties in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC to "encourage those who have been wronged to appeal to this committee" and to carry out the rehabilitation work of the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movements. This suggestion is seriously wrong from the point of view of the country's political system and acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party. Instead of the original organs that made the mistakes announcing the rehabilitation, another committee is organized to carry out the rehabilitation, which infringes on the powers of the state's procuratorial, supervisory, judicial, and public security departments. This would undermine the country's political system. Instead of the Party groups that originally led the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movements carrying out the rehabilitation, it is to be carried out in another institution, which attempts to negate the leadership of the grassroots Party groups. This speech was actually equivalent to appealing for grievances for all counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries who were punished or struggled against in the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movements, which may incite them to carry out disruptive and illegal activities again. After this speech, newspapers and broadcasts in Taiwan and Hong Kong successively used it for propaganda, which proves that this speech completely lost the standpoint of the Chinese people, became a spokesman for the enemy, and spoke for the enemy. After the speech, I received more than 170 letters supporting the absurd remarks. I did not ask what the purpose of the letter writers was, and I even instructed the secretary to reply to them, and asked them to "create public opinion from all aspects and make suggestions to the CPPCC and the United Front Department." Although only five reply letters were sent, the motive for instructing the reply was bad, and it was an attempt to support and incite the evil acts of reactionaries. This is a behavior that is unfavorable to the Party and unfavorable to socialism. This is the first point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt.

Second, my speech at the United Front Department symposium on May 10th raised the contradiction between the Communist Party and the democratic parties in the development of intellectuals, which is actually equivalent to hoping that the Communist Party would not develop in intellectuals, so as to achieve the purpose of expanding the organization and strengthening the power of the democratic parties to confront the leading Party. Although I also said in my speech: "I not only do not oppose intellectuals joining the Communist Party, but also think it is a glorious thing," the spirit of the entire speech and the logical conclusion must be to hope that the leading Party will not develop in intellectuals, so that the democratic parties can develop greatly in intellectuals. This is to get rid of the leadership of the Communist Party, and is an anti-Party and anti-socialist remark. I have always believed that young Party members in cultural and educational institutions should not and cannot lead the elderly, senior intellectuals. I said such wrong things at the working conference of the China Democratic League:
	"The petty-bourgeois small intellectuals and the petty-bourgeois big intellectuals are a contradiction."
This sentence proves that I only look at the issue of intellectuals from the size and quantity of knowledge of intellectuals, and do not look at the nature of knowledge, whether it is Marxist-Leninist knowledge or non-Marxist-Leninist knowledge, let alone look at it from the class standpoint. I did not understand that in a socialist society, the bourgeoisie should be led by the proletariat. For more than a year, standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, I made a series of wrong speeches at the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the CPPCC, not emphasizing the ideological transformation of old intellectuals, always pushing the responsibility for the separation of intellectuals from Party members on the Party members, not emphasizing the transformation of old intellectuals, but emphasizing the faults of Party members, which strengthened the anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas of old intellectuals. In my speech at the National Committee of the CPPCC in 1957, I even proposed that the Chinese scholar-official class's scholars were: "Scholars die for those who appreciate them," hoping for "three visits to the thatched cottage," hoping for "treating virtuous people with courtesy," etc., which completely negated the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. This error is serious. On the issue of opposing the leadership of senior intellectuals by young Party members in cultural and educational institutions, I also completely misunderstood the meaning of accepting the leadership of the Party. I personally wholeheartedly admire the leadership of Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and the Party's superior leaders. I thought this was accepting the leadership of the Party, but I did not understand that the leadership of the Party is the leadership of the entire Party, the leadership of the entire Party in all strata and institutions of the country. I did not understand that opposing the leadership of lower-level Party committees is opposing the Party, and is not respecting the leadership of the Party. All my remarks weakened the prestige of the Party, and were actually anti-Party and anti-socialist. This is the second point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt.

Third, standing in the position of vice chairman of the China Democratic League, for more than a year, cooperating with Zhang Bojun, led the China Democratic League in the wrong direction. This not only prevented the China Democratic League from being a good assistant to the Party, but also made the ideologically backward members lose their direction in the chaotic situation of the rightists' rampant attacks, and even had the behavior of fueling the flames. This is not conducive to the leadership of the Party and not conducive to the socialist cause. The China Democratic League went in the wrong direction, which played an extremely bad role in the rampant attacks on the Party by rightists this time. The occurrence of this kind of thing is not accidental. The China Democratic League is a political group of middle and upper-class intellectuals. It now has about 30,000 members. The vast majority of intellectuals among the members are progressive. Since the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League in 1956, the China Democratic League has overemphasized the policy of receiving middle and backward intellectuals. Therefore, the number of ideologically backward rightists among the new and old members has also increased. For more than a year, the China Democratic League has not seriously done a good job in the education and transformation of its members, which has made some right-wing members in the China Democratic League unable to stand firm on the position of supporting the Party and supporting socialism. For more than a year, due to the cooperation between me and Zhang Bojun, we have had an incorrect interpretation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," which made these two slogans a tool for rightists to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" was originally a policy to encourage the emergence of new art and free competition. "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy of independent thinking and free debate in science. These are all excellent policies for the development of Chinese literature, art, and science today. Due to the cooperation between Zhang and Luo, these two sentences were used as political tools, advocating the so-called unconditional "great blooming" and "great contending," and sometimes even using "blooming" and "contending" as tools to maliciously attack the Party and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. "Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was originally to encourage all democratic parties to do a good job in their own class ideological transformation, to criticize each other, to persuade each other, and to stand firm on the socialist position to be loyal assistants to the leading Party. Zhang and Luo's cooperation distorted this policy as a strategy for democratic parties to expand their organizations, strengthen their power, and improve their status, so as to confront the leading Party. In the spring of this year, the materials reflected by the organizations of the China Democratic League in various places have already discovered this tendency. Zhang and Luo not only did not correct it, but also at this year's work conference, Zhang Bojun proposed "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" as the central work, which I strongly supported. The absurd suggestions of Zhang and Luo at the symposium of the United Front Department in May, Zhang Bojun's "Political Design Institute," and my "Rehabilitation Committee" further fueled the arrogance of the right-wing members in the China Democratic League.

Now the China Democratic League has about 30,000 members, and its organizational units are scattered in nearly one hundred strongholds. The China Democratic League almost has grassroots organizations in middle and upper-level cultural and educational institutions. The influence of the China Democratic League, this political group, on the national cultural and educational work is very large. Zhang and Luo are the first and second vice chairmen of the league, and are the people actually responsible for leading. These two people have made wrong remarks on "blooming" and "contending" and on "long-term coexistence" and "mutual supervision." What the superiors do, the subordinates follow, and the impact is widespread and bad. In May, when the rightists launched a rampant attack in cultural and educational institutions, some right-wing members among the members of the China Democratic League in various places participated in this anti-Party and anti-socialist activity. This is not accidental. Zhang and Luo cooperated to lead the China Democratic League, sowing evil causes and reaping evil results. This is the third point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt today.

Fourth, since 1949, I have been engaged in sectarianism and informal organization in the central committee of the China Democratic League, which has affected the unity of the China Democratic League and hindered the leading Party's implementation of the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. The constituent members of this informal organization are basically people who have been poisoned by British and American education, and are intellectuals with bourgeois ideas. This informal organization exists not only in Beijing, but also in many provinces in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China. The purpose of the informal organization is to compete for power and position in the league, and to compete for personal power and profit. This purpose is despicable and shameful. This informal organization stopped its activities in 1952 and no longer exists on the surface. However, the spiritual connection and ideological response of this group of people have not been fundamentally severed. This group of people has been friends, classmates, or colleagues for many years, and they resonate and seek each other in thought. Any wrong remarks or actions of anyone among them, especially my own wrong remarks and actions, will cause resonance with each other. After the Party's rectification movement was launched in May this time, it was discovered that a group of people in the past informal organization, whether in Beijing or in local areas, almost all had anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and behaviors, and even colluded with local rightists to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies. Although I have not issued any secret instructions or sent anyone to any place to carry out any contact, due to the ideological connection of this group of people, there will naturally be bad results of corresponding in thought. In today's anti-rightist struggle, almost all of this group of people have committed serious crimes and have become objects of struggle. I reflect on myself and have misled myself and others. This is the fourth point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt today.

Fifth, I lack a correct analysis and understanding of the international situation, and have made some wrong remarks in private conversations, which have affected people's firm confidence in the forces of peace. In recent years, I have been constantly reading British and American books and magazines. I did not learn enough Marxist-Leninist theory, so I was invisibly poisoned by these British and American magazines. I lacked a correct understanding of the anti-Stalin incident at the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Polish-Hungarian events. After the Polish-Hungarian events, I believed that the wavering of some so-called progressive people in Britain, the United States, and other capitalist countries in Europe was a split in the peace camp, rather than a strengthening of the forces of peace. I did not know how to estimate the international situation from the increasing growth of the people's peaceful forces, and I did not know how to estimate the peaceful forces from the increasing growth of the entire world's anti-aggression and anti-colonialism. Therefore, I wrongly believed that the international situation was more tense, not easing. I have said this erroneous view when the CPPCC group discussed Premier Zhou's report on his visit to eleven countries, and I have indeed said it to Pu Xixiu, Pan Dakui, Wang Zaoshi, and others in private conversations. Arbitrarily spreading a pessimistic atmosphere about the international situation is not conducive to the international unity of socialism and the international unity of peace-loving people all over the world. This is the fifth point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt today.

Sixth, I cannot selflessly cherish and help certain social undertakings, but my backward thinking has affected certain social undertakings and suffered damage. My relationship with Wenhui Daily is a typical example. In recent years, I have been quite concerned about the creation and republication of Wenhui Daily, which is an undeniable fact. On the one hand, it is due to my personal friendship with Pu Xixiu for ten years. I hope she will do her job well. On the other hand, I also wrongly believe that there should still be so-called non-governmental public opinion organs in China. Therefore, whenever I have the opportunity, I encourage Wenhui Daily not to run a newspaper that is exactly the same as People's Daily. Since Xu Zhucheng of Wenhui Daily has repeatedly expressed his complaints about the Party group to me, I have indeed repeatedly directly and indirectly expressed to the person in charge of Wenhui Daily that I think the newspaper should not be too superstitious about the leadership of the Party group, and should come to Beijing to report things. I meet with Pu Xixiu on a daily basis, and she often asks me for my opinion on Wenhui Daily. Through her, I instilled some unhealthy and unprogressive opinions into Wenhui Daily, which invisibly made her work commit right-leaning errors, and indirectly made Wenhui Daily commit errors. Wenhui Daily was praised in March and April this year, but today it is the object of the anti-rightist struggle, mainly because Wenhui Daily made mistakes during the rectification period. This happened in May and June this year. Pu Xixiu went to the Northeast for inspection in May this year. When she came back from the inspection, I went abroad again on June 3rd. Even if I really used Wenhui Daily to expand right-wing propaganda during the rectification period, I would not be able to use it in fact during this period. I am only explaining the facts, not shirking responsibility. The right-leaning of Wenhui Daily, Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu, the two of them, have already admitted their responsibility for their own bourgeois ideas, but I cannot shirk the responsibility for my absurd proposition of advising Wenhui Daily not to be superstitious about the Party group and my influence of constantly instilling right-wing ideas through Pu Xixiu. I have not done a good job in sincerely cherishing a social undertaking, and through my bad influence, a newspaper with a glorious history before liberation has become an anti-Party and anti-socialist public opinion organ today, and I am responsible. This is the sixth point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt.

Seventh, I am not active and hardworking in the work of state organs, and I cannot sincerely cherish the comrades in the organs. This is also my serious mistake. In recent years, due to my lack of enthusiasm for the people's cause, I have only been satisfied with my official position, and I have made myself the biggest bureaucrat. Since taking office as the Minister of Forestry Industry, I have not seriously studied this business and earnestly performed my duties. In my heart, I often think that forestry industry is not my specialty, so I perfunctorily and prevaricated whenever things happen. This has delayed the business of the Ministry of Forestry Industry, and at the same time indirectly delayed the country's construction cause. Due to my arrogance, complacency, I cannot get along with the comrades in the organs sincerely and kindly. I am impatient, rude, and often despise and scold my colleagues excessively. Specifically, I have not fulfilled my responsibility to cherish and help my two secretaries, especially the confidential secretary Shao Ciyun. Because she refused to follow my will and join the China Democratic League, I dealt with her with cold and ruthless methods, and even hindered her from striving for progress and asking to join the Party. This is a concrete example of my expanding the organization of the China Democratic League and even preventing intellectuals from joining the Party. I cannot work honestly and loyally for public affairs, and I cannot treat my work colleagues sincerely, which damages the country's construction cause and is not conducive to the leadership of the Party. This is the seventh point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt.

Eighth, in recent years, I have been arrogant, complacent, content with ideological backwardness, never seriously studying, and striving for transformation. I occasionally dabbled in some books on Marxist-Leninist theory, and I was complacent, thinking that I knew one corner and three corners, and I could learn without learning. I accidentally got a smattering of knowledge from Marxist-Leninist books and used it as a tool to justify my faults. I thought of myself as a person who "can use words to cover up faults and use wisdom to embellish mistakes." I was unwilling to humbly seek advice from progressive comrades in the league, and often despised some progressive comrades as dogmatists. This kind of arrogance and complacency not only misled myself, but also affected the progress of a group of friends who were close to me on a daily basis. Being content with backwardness harms others and harms myself. This is the eighth point that I should bow my head and confess my guilt.

My mistakes and sins are of course not limited to the above eight points. Today, I only expose the mistakes I have committed in the past year or so in the anti-Party and anti-socialist aspects, and make a preliminary confession. As for the mistakes and sins I committed in my words and deeds before liberation, there are even more. My political history is dirty. Thirty years ago, I wrote articles criticizing communism when I was the editor-in-chief of Crescent Moon Magazine. I joined Zhang Junmai's National Socialist Party. I initiated the China Democratic League to consistently take the third line. I consistently promoted the ideas of British and American bourgeois democracy. And in the past, I had secret contacts with Marshall, Stuart Leighton, and others in the United States, which are all well-known facts. Today, I will not repeat them. Now I will frankly talk about my personal thoughts.

I am a person with a mixture of feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas. From the age of five or six until I entered Tsinghua School, I have never left my father and brother's family education. This is the education of a scholar-official family in the old society. From Tsinghua until I returned from studying in Britain and the United States, I have always received bourgeois education. After returning to China, all my words and deeds were based on the ideas of British and American bourgeoisie. Politically, I have consistently taken the third line. After the victory of liberation in 1949, I came to Beijing with Zhang Lan, the former chairman of the China Democratic League. Because I am an individualist with bourgeois ideas, I have a strong sense of fame and position, so I engaged in sectarianism within the league. At the same time, I do not deny that I still had a conflicting mood with the Party at that time. After the Zhang Dongsun collusion with American spies incident occurred, many members of the league and society had serious doubts about me. Li Weihan, the Minister of the United Front Department, explained to the leaders of various parties that I had nothing to do with the Zhang Dongsun incident, and proposed that I be elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. I think the Party has a true right and wrong, and does not wrong anyone. I am very grateful to the Party. I have increased my confidence in the Party. Since then, I have also read some Marxist-Leninist and Chairman Mao's works. Although I do not really understand dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and although I have not accepted the communist worldview, I have indeed improved my understanding of the benefits of communism. In recent years, the country has made great achievements in all aspects of construction. I ask myself, only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such achievements. I have repeatedly talked about this point to foreign guests who have visited me. In recent years, my own political status has gradually improved, and my own daily life is extremely stable. Although my bourgeois ideas have not been transformed, I ask myself that I have absolutely no ambition or conspiracy to overthrow the Party and overthrow socialism. Even if I am a very selfish and self-interested person, overthrowing the Party and overthrowing socialism would not do me any good. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU and after the Polish-Hungarian events, I once had doubts about communism, but I think the Communist Party led by Chairman Mao emphasizes "combining with the practice of the Chinese revolution" and is different from the situation in Poland and Hungary after all. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, China has a bright and brilliant future. This is what I absolutely recognize. Since the issue of intellectuals was raised in 1955, I have expressed sympathy for the old intellectuals and often wanted to say some fair words in my erroneous imagination on their behalf to win their favor. This is the truth. This is the root of my mistakes in the past one or two years. I have not stood firm and always stood on the bourgeois position to speak for the old intellectuals. I did not understand the true meaning of the Party's leadership, and I underestimated the progress of intellectuals. Therefore, I have always wanted to please intellectuals, especially old intellectuals. I thought that this would expand the influence of the China Democratic League, expand the organization of the China Democratic League, and improve the status of the China Democratic League, so that I could obtain more and greater power in the decision-making of national affairs to solve these problems. My delusion is only this, and there is absolutely no conspiracy to overthrow the Party, overthrow socialism, and restore capitalism.

Then why would you issue such anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and behaviors? Today, I can only say that this is driven by the subconscious of bourgeois ideas. Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, their ideology must be reflected, and must be reflected in political and ideological issues, and stubbornly express themselves in various ways. It is impossible for them not to reflect and not to express." This thoroughly explains the heart of a person with bourgeois ideas. Of course, I admit that I am a person whose bourgeois ideas have not been moved at all. In recent years, my political status has been quite high, so I have become more arrogant and complacent. With this kind of thinking, it will be revealed sooner or later if it is not revealed today. I will make a mistake sooner or later if I do not make a mistake today. This shows that although I have no intention of being anti-Party or anti-socialist today, I have committed the crime of being anti-Party and anti-socialist in my words and deeds. This more fully proves the necessity of ideological transformation and the importance of the anti-rightist struggle. Otherwise, many old intellectuals like me who have not been transformed well will unknowingly embark on a dead end.

Today, I have initially confessed the mistakes I have committed in my words and deeds. The mistakes I have committed should not be pushed onto Zhang Bojun, and the mistakes Zhang Bojun has committed should not be involved with me. As for the incidents that I and Zhang Bojun have jointly cooperated on, they should also be clearly confessed.

I must explain here that I am an ideologically backward person, and Zhang Bojun is also an ideologically backward person. Although we two have absolutely not had any separate dealings or separate secret talks from Beidaihe last year until now, our speeches at the symposium of the United Front Department have absolutely not been exchanged in advance. However, since there is a connection in thought, many wrong remarks and actions can be made without prior consultation.

Due to my cooperation with Zhang Bojun, in the past year or so, I have supported Zhang Bojun's proposals on many important policies of the China Democratic League, so the China Democratic League has implemented some wrong policies. To give some concrete examples: In March this year, the China Democratic League held a work conference. Zhang Bojun suggested that "letting a hundred schools of thought contend and letting a hundred flowers bloom" be the central work of the China Democratic League in 1957. I agreed and supported his proposal. Zhang Bojun advocated that the democratic parties should develop to several million people. He emphasized the great development at the work conference. I think the China Democratic League should double its number of about 20,000 people in 1956, so I also emphasized the great development at the work conference. The most important thing is that the China Democratic League established four committees in May, namely, the Party Committee System Committee, the Scientific System Committee, the Committee with Positions and Powers, and the Committee for Long-term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision. Zhang Bojun notified me by phone that he wanted to invite the Propaganda Committee, the Academic Committee, and the Cultural and Educational Committee to talk about great blooming and great contending. I agreed on the phone. Later, the Central Committee of the League established these four committees. The establishment of these four committees was indeed not reported to Chairman Shen of the China Democratic League, nor was it discussed in advance with Vice Chairmen Shi Liang and Gao Chongmin, let alone decided by the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League. Today, the purpose and intention of these four committees are very clear. The Party Committee System Committee intends to abolish the Party committee system in colleges and universities. The Scientific System Committee has already come up with a set of anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific system proposals. The purpose of the two committees with positions and powers and long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is to expand the status of the China Democratic League, increase the powers of the China Democratic League, so as to jointly decide national policies with the Communist Party, parallelly exercise power, and confront the Communist Party. After the establishment of these four committees, Zhang Bojun also expressed to me that he wanted the China Democratic League to send people to various places to promote this kind of work, collect materials, make suggestions to the central government, and cooperate with the people sent by his Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to carry out work. I agreed with his opinion. I went abroad on June 3rd, and the subsequent work was led and arranged by him. I don't know the situation. However, I am responsible for this kind of illegal activity using legal organs, carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies, and I cannot shirk this responsibility.

Today, I can only confess these incidents that I have cooperated with Zhang Bojun on. He is the president of Guangming Daily, and I have never asked about the affairs of Guangming Daily in the past three or four years. He is the chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and I cannot ask about the affairs of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He has never talked to me about what kind of political ambitions he has and what kind of ambitions he has for intellectuals. I disagree with many of his daily remarks and proposals, such as the bicameral system, and the development of democratic parties to millions, etc. I have criticized him to Gao Chongmin and others in the league, but I have never said it to him. I have never talked to him about what kind of political ambitions or wishes I have. This is the true relationship between Zhang and Luo in the past year. I will never hide it, and I will never fabricate it.

Now the newspapers and many people's confessions have put forward the term "Zhang Luo Alliance," and believe that this is the highest command and leadership organ for the rampant attacks on the Party by the rightists this time, and is a central conspiracy organ with organization, planning, steps, and programs. Today, I will not defend myself. I will truthfully confess the sinful behaviors that I have cooperated with Zhang Bojun on. I also ask the leading Party and the people of the whole country to conduct a thorough investigation and seriously investigate. If it is discovered in the future that I have deliberately concealed some kind of conspiracy in my cooperative behavior with Zhang Bojun, I am willing to receive the punishment I deserve.

Representatives, I am standing on this stage today to bow my head and confess my guilt to you, not to make any defense. Now the newspapers and many people's confessions have exposed many facts of my words and deeds, exposed my historical sins, and exposed my current conspiracies. Today, I will not defend myself. The question today is not whether I said that sentence, whether I did that thing, whether I colluded with and used those few people, whether I commanded and incited those right-wing groups. I firmly believe that the Chinese Communist Party has a true right and wrong for these things and will not wrong anyone. In the future, the truth will naturally come out. And I also ask the representatives to allow me to have the opportunity to further thoroughly confess in the future. Some questions about the China Democratic League, I will also confess to the China Democratic League. Which mistakes I should honestly admit, I will definitely honestly admit, and which are not facts, I will also clarify in the future.

Representatives, my mistakes are major, and my sins are serious. Today, I am ashamed to the point of being unable to show my face. I am sorry to Chairman Mao, sorry to the leading Party, sorry to the tens of thousands of comrades in the China Democratic League, sorry to the country, and sorry to the people of the whole country.

It is not enough for me to just bow my head and confess my guilt today. Today, the question is whether I suddenly realize my errors and am determined to change my ways, or whether I persist in my mistakes and cut myself off from the country and the people.

I thank the leading Party and thank the government, "Today the door of socialist transformation is open." There is an old Chinese saying, "It is great to be able to correct mistakes." Today, in front of all of you representatives, I express my utmost sincerity and determine that I will bravely and resolutely move forward to this widely opened door. I will thoroughly transform myself and will be loyal and honest to serve the socialist cause and serve the Chinese people in the future.

### 我的初步交代  罗隆基的发言

专栏：

    我的初步交代
    罗隆基的发言
    我是中华人民共和国一个有了罪过的人，我最近有些言论和行为犯了反党、反社会主义的罪过。今天，我站在这个庄严的讲台上是来向诸位代表低头认罪，是来向全国人民低头认罪。
    解放以后，党和人民对我的照顾是优厚的。我担负的是国家机关和人民团体中的相当高的而且相当重要的职位。站在这样的岗位上，有了反党、反社会主义的言论和行为，我的恶劣影响就更大，我的罪过就更严重了。
    现在我经过这次反右派斗争后，感觉到了羞愧无以自容的地步，我今日幡然悔悟，愿意以今天之我来同昨日之我作斗争，来检举我自己的罪过。
    第一、我五月二十二日在统战部座谈会上的发言，对最近全国各地右派分子，甚至反动分子和反革命分子猖狂向党进攻的造乱行为，有了挑拨和点火的责任。五月二十二号我在统战部座谈会上提出要在人民代表大会常委会和政协常委会中成立一个有共产党、民主党派和其他有关方面人员参加的委员会，“鼓励有委曲的人向这个委员会申诉”并且进行对“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”的平反工作。这个建议从国家的政治体制和接受共产党的领导这两点来说，都是严重错误的。不由原来弄错了的机关来宣布平反，却另外组织一个委员会来进行平反，这就侵犯了国家检察、监察、司法、公安各部门的职权。这就破坏了国家的政治体制。不由原来领导“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”的党组来进行平反，而要在另外一个机构来进行平反，这就企图否定基层党组的领导，这次发言实际等于替“三反”、“五反”、“肃反”中被惩处或被斗争的一切反革命分子和反动分子呼冤，这就可能煽动他们再一次去进行作乱犯法的行为。这次发言以后，台湾和香港的报纸和广播，纷纷借此加以宣传，这就证明这次发言完全失去了中国人民的立场，成了敌人的代言人，为敌人张目。在发言以后，我接到170多封支持荒谬言论的信，我不问来信的人目的是什么，竟指示秘书向他们复信，并要他们“从各方面造成舆论，向政协和统战部建议”。虽然复信只发出了五封，但指示回信的动机是恶劣的，是企图向反动分子的罪恶行为支腰点火。这是不利于党不利于社会主义的行为。这是我应该低头认罪的第一点。
    第二、我五月十日在统战部座谈会上的发言，提出了共产党和民主党派在知识分子中发展的矛盾，实际等于希望共产党不在知识分子中发展，以达到民主党派扩大组织、加强力量，对领导党分庭抗礼的目的。尽管我在发言中也说了：“知识分子加入共产党，我不仅不反对，而且认为是一件光荣的事情”这样的话，但整个发言的精神和逻辑的结论必定是希望领导党不在知识分子中发展，可以使民主党派在知识分子中大发展。这是摆脱共产党的领导，反党反社会主义的言论。我一向认为文教机关中青年党员不应该并且不能够领导老年的旧的高级知识分子。我在民盟工作会议中说过这样错误的话：
      “无产阶级小知识分子同小资产阶级的大知识分子是个矛盾”。
    这句话就证明，我对知识分子问题只从知识分子知识的大小、多寡来看问题，没有从知识的性质，是马列主义的知识还是非马列主义知识看问题，更没有从阶级立场上来看问题。我没有懂得在社会主义的社会里，资产阶级是应该受无产阶级领导的。我一年多来，站在资产阶级的立场上，在人民代表大会上和在政协全国委员会会议上先后有一系列的错误发言，不强调旧知识分子的思想改造，总把知识分子同党员隔膜的责任推在党员方面，不强调旧知识分子的改造，而强调党员的过失，这就加强了旧知识分子反党、反社会主义的观念。在1957年政协全国委员会的发言中，我甚至提出中国士大夫阶级的士是：“士为知己者死”是希望“三顾茅庐”，是希望“礼贤下士”的待遇等等，这就完全否定了党对知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策。这个错误是严重的。在反对文教机关中青年党员领导高级知识分子问题上，我把接受党的领导这个意义亦完全认识错了。我个人对毛主席、刘委员长、周总理以及党的上级领袖们的领导是心悦诚服的。我以为这就是接受了党的领导，而不懂得党的领导是整个党的领导，是整个党在全国各阶层、各机关的领导。我没有懂得反对下级党的领导就是反党，就是不尊重党的领导，我这一切言论就削弱了党的威信，实际就是反党、反社会主义。这是我应该低头认罪的第二点。
    第三、我站在民主同盟副主席的岗位上，一年多来，同章伯钧合作，把民盟指向了右的方向，这不止使民主同盟没有做党的好助手，并且使盟员中思想落后分子在右派分子猖狂进攻的混乱局面中迷失了方向，甚至有了推波助浪的行为，这就不利于党的领导，不利于社会主义事业。民主同盟走向了右的方向，这在这次右派分子猖狂向党进攻的造乱行为中起了极端恶劣的作用，这种事情的发生不是偶然的。民主同盟是个中上层知识分子的政治团体，它现在有了三万左右的盟员。盟员中极大多数知识分子是进步的。从1956年民盟第二次全国代表大会以后，民盟过分地强调了接收中间和落后知识分子的政策。因此新旧盟员中思想落后的右派分子亦日益增多了。一年来民盟并没有认真做好对盟员的教育、改造工作，这就使民主同盟中一些右派盟员不能站稳拥护党拥护社会主义的立场。一年多来，由于我同章伯钧的合作，我们对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这个政策有了不正确的解释，使这两句口号，成了右派分子反党、反社会主义的工具。“百花齐放”本来是鼓励艺术推陈出新，自由竞争的政策。“百家争鸣”是科学上独立思考、自由辩论的政策。这都是今天中国文艺科学发展上的优良政策。由于章罗合作，利用了这两句作为政治上的工具，提倡所谓的无条件的“大鸣”“大放”，有时竟把“鸣”、“放”做成恶意地攻击党、反对共产党领导的工具。“长期共存，互相监督”这本是来鼓励各民主党派做好自己的阶级思想改造，本互相批评、互相规劝、站稳社会主义立场做领导党的忠实助手的政策。章罗合作，把这个政策歪曲地解释为民主党派、扩大组织、加强力量、提高地位，以便与领导党分庭抗礼的策略。今年春季，各地盟的组织反映到盟中央的材料已经发现了这种偏向，章、罗两人，不止不加以纠正，并且在今年的工作会议中，章伯钧提出“百花齐放”“百家争鸣”的中心工作，我加以有力支持。章、罗两人五月间在统战部座谈会上的发言，章伯钧提出的“政治设计院”，我提出的“平反委员会”的荒谬建议就更助长了盟员中右派分子大鸣大放的气焰。
    现在民盟有三万左右的盟员，散在各地的组织单位将近一百个据点。民盟在中上层的文教机关中几乎都有基层组织。民盟这个政治团体在全国文教工作方面的影响是很大的。章、罗二人是盟的第一和第二副主席，是实际负责领导的人。这两个人对“鸣”“放”，对“长期共存”“互相监督”有了错误的言论，上行下效，影响是广泛的而且恶劣的。五月间，右派分子在文教机关中发动猖狂进攻，各地盟组织中的盟员中，有些右派分子参加了这种反党反社会主义的活动，这不是偶然的。章罗合作，领导民盟，播了恶因，结了恶果。这是我今天应该低头认罪的第三点。
    第四、从1949年起，我在民盟中央闹宗派主义，搞无形组织，影响了民主同盟不能团结，并且妨碍了领导党贯彻对知识分子的团结教育改造政策。这个无形组织的构成分子，基本上是受了英美教育毒害的人，并且是资产阶级思想的知识分子。这个无形组织不仅在北京有，并且散布在华东、中南和西南许多省份。无形组织的目的，是在盟中争夺权位，是为个人争权夺利。这种目的是卑劣的，可耻的。这个无形组织到了1952年就停止活动了，表面上不存在了。但这一批人精神上的联系，思想上的呼应，是没有根本断绝的。这一批人是多年来的朋友，同学，或同事，他们在思想上是同声相应，同气相求的。他们中任何人有一错误的言论或行动，特别我自己有了错误的言论和行动，会引起彼此共鸣的。这次五月间党的整风运动发动以后，就发现以往无形组织中的一批人，无论在北京或在地方几乎都有了反党反社会主义的言论和行为，甚至还勾结了当地的右派分子进行反党反社会主义的阴谋。尽管我没有发过任何秘密指示，或派任何人到任何地方去进行任何联系，但由于这批人思想上的联系，就当然会有同声相应的恶劣结果。在今天反右派斗争中，这一批人几乎都犯了严重的罪过，都成了斗争的对象。我反躬自问，误己误人。这是我今天应低头认罪的第四点。
    第五、我对国际形势缺乏正确的分析和认识，私人谈话中发表过一些错误的言论，影响了人民对和平力量的坚强信心。这些年来，我不断的看英美的书报杂志，自己对马列主义理论本来学得不够，我就无形中受了这些英美杂志的毒害。我对苏共二十次代表大会的反斯大林事件，波匈事件，都缺乏正确的认识。波匈事件后，英美及欧洲其他资本主义国家中某些所谓的进步人士的动摇，我便认为这是和平阵营中的分裂，而不是和平力量的加强团结。不晓得从人民和平力量的日益壮大来估计国际形势，不晓得从整个世界反侵略反殖民主义的日益壮大来估计和平力量，因此，我错误的认为国际形势更紧张了，不是和缓了。这种错误的看法，我在政协小组座谈周总理访问十一国的报告时，曾经说过，我对私人谈话中向浦熙修、潘大逵、王造时等人亦的确说过。任意散布国际形势的悲观空气，这是不利于社会主义的国际团结，和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结。这是我今天应该低头认罪的第五点。
    第六、我对某些社会事业不能无私的加以爱护和帮助，却使自己的落后思想影响到某种社会事业而受到损害。我同文汇报的关系是一个典型的例子。这些年来我对文汇报的创立和复刊是相当关切的，这是无可否认的事实。这一方面由于十年来我同浦熙修的私人友谊，我希望她把她的事情做好，另一方面，我亦错误的认为在中
  国还应该有社会上所谓的民间言论机关。因此我遇有机会就鼓励文汇报不要办成同人民日报一模一样的报纸。由于文汇报徐铸成一再向我发表埋怨党组的牢骚，我的确曾一再直接间接向文汇报负责人表示过，认为报馆不要过于迷信党组领导，有事到北京来反映。我与浦熙修是日常见面的，她亦经常向我征询有关文汇报的意见。通过她我向文汇报灌输了一些不健康不进步的意见，无形中使她的工作犯了右倾的错误，间接又使文汇报犯了错误。文汇报在今年三四月间是受人夸誉的报纸，今天为反右派斗争的对象，主要在整风时期文汇报犯了错误。这是今年五、六月间的事情，今年五月间浦熙修到东北视察去了，等到她视察回来，我六月三号又出国了。即使我真有利用文汇报，在整风时期，来扩大右派宣传，事实上这个时期亦无法利用的。我只说明事实，并非洗刷责任。文汇报的右倾，徐铸成、浦熙修两人自己的资产阶级思想已经承认了他们的责任，但我以往劝文汇报不要迷信党组的荒谬主张，我通过浦熙修经常灌输右派思想的影响是不能推卸责任的。对一个社会事业没有做到真诚爱护，并且通过我的恶劣影响，使一个解放以前有光荣历史的报纸今天成了反党反社会主义的言论机关，我是有责任的。这是我应该低头认罪的第六点。
    第七、对国家机关的工作不积极努力，对机关中工作同志不能真诚爱护，这亦是我严重的错误。这些年来，由于我对人民事业的热诚不够，只满足于自己的官职地位，就把自己造成一个最大的官僚主义者。就任森林工业部部长以来，我就没有好好的钻研过这项业务，认真的履行自己的职责。内心常常自以为森林工业对我是用非所长，于是遇事就敷衍塞责。这就贻误了森工部的业务，同时亦间接地贻误了国家的建设事业。由于自己的自高自大，骄傲自满，对机关中的工作同志，不能推诚相与，和蔼相处。自己性情急躁，脾气粗暴，对同事常常过分轻视，严厉斥责。具体的例子，对我的两位秘书，特别机要秘书邵慈云就没有尽到爱护帮助的责任。由于她不肯遵循我的意旨，加入民盟，我就用冷酷打击的方法对付，甚至妨碍她争取进步和要求入党的愿望。这是我要扩大民盟组织，甚至阻碍知识分子入党的具体实例。我对公家的事业不能忠诚老实的进行工作，对工作同事不能推诚相与对待，损害了国家的建设事业，并且不利于党的领导，这是我应该低头认罪的第七点。
    第八、这些年来，我骄傲自满，甘心于思想落后，从不认真学习，努力改造。我偶然涉猎过一些马列主义理论的书本，就沾沾自满，自以为一隅三隅，不学自通。从马列主义书本中，偶然得到一知半解，就把它作为饰非辩过的工具。我自以为是
  “言足以饰非，智足以文过”的人，不肯虚心求教于盟员中的进步同志，并且每每轻视某些进步同志为教条主义者。这种自骄自满的态度，不仅贻误了自己，且影响了一批日常接近的朋友的进步，自甘落后害人害己，这是我应该低头认罪的第八点。
    我的错误和罪过当然不止上面这八点，我今天只检举我一年多来在反党、反社会主义方面所犯的错误，先作初步交代。至于我在解放前的言论和行动所犯的错误和罪过就更多。我的政治历史是肮脏的。三十年前主编新月杂志写过批评共产主义的文章。我加入过张君劢的国社党，我发起民主同盟一贯走第三条路线，我一贯宣传英美资产阶级民主政治思想。并且以往同美国的马歇尔、司徒雷登等秘密往来等等，这都是人所共知的事实。今天我就不重复列数了。现在我来坦白地谈一谈我个人的思想。
    我是一个封建思想和资产阶级思想混合起来的人。从小五六岁直到进入清华学校，我就没有离开过父兄的家庭教育。这是旧社会里士大夫家庭的教育。从清华直到英美留学归来，一直受的是资产阶级的教育。回国以后，一切言论和行动，都是英美资产阶级思想那一套。政治上一贯走的是第三条路线。1949年解放胜利后，我同前民盟主席张澜来到北京。由于我是个资产阶级思想的个人主义者，我的名位观念很重，因此在盟内闹宗派主义，同时我不否认当时我对党尚有抵触的情绪的。张东荪勾结美国特务事件发生后，盟员和社会上许多人都对我有了严重的怀疑。统战部部长李维汉向各党派负责解释，认为我同张东荪事件没有关系，并且提议把我选成政协常务委员。我认为党是有真是真非，不冤枉任何人的。我万分感谢党。我对党增加了信心。从此以后，我亦看了一些马列主义和毛主席的著作，我虽然不是真正懂得辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，我虽然没有接受共产主义的世界观，我对共产主义的好处的确提高了一些认识。几年来国家在各方面的建设有了伟大的成绩，我自问，只有在共产党的领导之下才能有这样的成绩。这点我对来访的外宾都一再谈过的。几年来，我自己政治地位日渐提高，我自己的日常生活极为安定，尽管我的资产阶级思想没有改造，但我自问绝对没有推翻党推翻社会主义的野心和阴谋。即令我是一个万分自私自利的人，推翻党，推翻社会主义这对我没有什么好处。苏共二十次党代表会议后，和波匈事件后，我对共产主义一度发生过怀疑，但我认为毛主席领导的共产党强调“结合中国革命的实践”毕竟与波匈情况不同。中国在共产党领导之下，是有光辉灿烂的前途的。这是我绝对认识的。从1955年知识分子问题提出后，我对旧知识分子表示同情，经常想代他们说些我错误想像中的公道话，取得他们的欢心，这是事实。这是我一二年来犯错误的根源思想。我没有站稳立场，总站在资产阶级立场上替旧知识分子说话。我没有懂得党的领导的真实意义，我低估了知识分子的进步。因此，我就一贯想讨好知识分子，特别旧知识分子，我以为这样就可以扩大民盟的影响，扩大民盟的组织，提高民盟的地位，能够在国事的决策上取得较多较大的权力来解决这些问题。我的妄想亦只此而已，绝对没有推翻党、推翻社会主义、恢复资本主义的阴谋。
    那末你为什么又会发出这种反党、反社会主义的言论和行为呢？今天我只能说这是资产阶级思想的下意识所主使的。毛主席说过：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的，一定要在政治问题和思想问题上反映出来的，用各种方法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映，不表现，是不可能的。”这就说透了有资产阶级思想的人的心。我当然承认我自己是资产阶级思想原封未动的人。几年来，政治地位相当高，就更加自高自大，得意忘形。有了这种思想，今天不露出来，迟早会露出来的。今天不犯错误，迟早要犯错误的。这就说明尽管我今天没有反党、反社会主义的居心，却在言论和行动上犯了反党、反社会主义罪过的原故，这更充分地证明思想改造的必要，反右派斗争的重要。否则，许多像我这样没有改造好的旧知识分子就会在不知不觉中走上绝路。
    今天我对自己在言论和行动所犯的错误，已经初步的交代出来，我自己所犯的错误不应该推到章伯钧身上，章伯钧所犯的错误，亦不应牵涉到我。至于我同章伯钧共同合作的事件，亦应该清清楚楚的交代出来。
    我这里必须说明我是一个思想落后的人，章伯钧亦是一个思想落后的人，尽管从去年在北戴河起，一直到现在我们两个人绝对没有单独的来往过，没有单独的密谈过，我们在统战部座谈会上的发言，亦绝对没有事先交换过意见，但思想既然有了联系，许多错误的言论和行动，就可以不约而同了。
    由于我同章伯钧的合作，一年多来，我在民盟许多重要政策上，支持了章伯钧的主张，因此使民盟执行了一些错误的政策。举些具体事例来说：今年三月民盟举行工作会议，章伯钧建议“百家争鸣，百花齐放”为民盟1957年的中心工作。我同意并且支持了他这个主张。章伯钧主张民主党派要发展到几百万人，他在工作会议中强调大发展，我认为民盟应对1956年的数目约二万余人，加倍发展，因此在工作会议中，我亦强调大发展。最重要的一件事，是民盟五月间成立了四个委员会，即党委制委员会，科学体制委员会，有职有权委员会，长期共存、互相监督委员会，四个委员会。章伯钧用电话通知我，要约宣委、学委、文教委员会来谈大鸣大放，我在电话中同意了。后来盟中央成立了这四个委员会，这件事的确没有请示过民盟沈主席，没有同史良、高崇民两位副主席事先商量，更没有经过民盟常委会决定。今天这四个委员会的目的和企图是很明显的。党委制委员会是企图取消大专学校中的党委制。科学体制委员会已经搞了一套反党反社会主义的科学体制的建议。有职有权和长期共存互相监督两个委员会的目的，是企图扩大民盟的地位，加大民盟的职权，以达到同共产党共同决定国策，平行执掌政权，与共产党分庭抗礼的目的。这四个委员会成立以后，章伯钧又向我表示过要由民盟派人到各地去推动这类工作，收集材料向中央提出建议，并且配合他的农工民主党所派的人进行工作。对他这种意见，我表示同意。六月三号我出国了，以后的工作是他领导和布置的，情况我就不知道了。但对这种利用合法机关，进行非法活动，进行反党反社会主义的阴谋，我附和其事，这种责任，我是不能推卸的。
    我同章伯钧合作的事件，今天只能交代这些。他是光明日报的社长，对光明日报的事情，三、四年来我从没有过问过。他是农工民主党的主席，对农工民主党的事情我不可能过问。他在政治上有什么野心，对知识分子有什么野心，他从来没有和我谈过。对他日常许多言论和主张，例如两院制，以及民主党派发展几百万等等，我不同意，我向高崇民和盟中其他人批评过，但从来没有向他说过。我在政治上有什么野心或愿望，我亦从来未同他谈过。这就是章罗两人一年来的真实关系。我绝不隐瞒，我绝不捏造。
    现在报纸上和许多人的交代中，都提出“章罗联盟”这样一个名词，都认为这是这次右派分子猖狂向党进攻的最高的指挥领导机关，是有组织、有计划、有步骤、有纲领的中心阴谋机关。今天我不辩解。我同章伯钧合作了的罪过行为，我据实交代。我还要请领导党和全国人民切实调查，认真追究。如果将来发现我同章伯钧的合作行为中我还有故意隐瞒某种阴谋，我愿受我应得的惩处。
    诸位代表，我今天站在这个台上，是来向诸位低头认罪的，不是来作什么辩解的。现在报纸上和许多人的交代中，已经揭发了我许多言论和行动的事实，揭发了我历史上的罪恶，揭发了我现时期的阴谋，我今天都不辩解。今天的问题，不是那句话我说了没有，那件事我做了没有，那几个人我勾结利用了没有，那些右派集团我指挥煽动了没有，对这些事情我坚决相信中国共产党是有真是真非的。不会冤枉任何人的。将来真是真非自然会水落石出的。并且我还要请各位代表让我将来有进一步彻底坦白交代的机会。有些关于民盟的问题，我还要到民盟去交代，哪些错误我应该老实承认的，我一定老老实实的承认，哪些不是事实，将来亦要弄个清楚明白。
    诸位代表我的错误是重大的，我的罪过是严重的。我今天已经羞愧到无地自容的地步，我对不起毛主席，对不起领导党，对不起民主同盟几万个同志，我对不起国家、对不起全国人民。
    我今天只是低头认罪是不够的。今天我的问题是幡然悔悟，决心改过自新，还是坚持错误，自绝于国家，自绝于人民。
    我感谢领导党，感谢政府，“今天社会主义改造的大门是开着的。”中国有句老话“过而能改，善莫大焉。”今天我在诸位代表面前，万分诚恳的表示，我下定了决心，我一定勇敢的、坚决的向这高敞开的大门前进，我要彻底改造自己，并且今后要忠诚老实的来为社会主义事业服务，来为中国人民服务。
