Most industrialists and businessmen often show an unstable socialist stance, ideological fluctuations, and even some have a resistant attitude towards socialist transformation when observing things and handling problems. Zhang Naiqi catered to this situation by creating a set of fallacies to win over the masses and elevate himself.

Consolidate Tianmin's Speech

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, and I agree with the report on the state's final accounts for 1956 and the state budget for 1957, the report on the national economic plan for 1957, the work report of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the work report of the Supreme People's Court, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Now I will talk about the great achievements of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state, and at the same time criticize the reactionary remarks made by the right-wing stubborn element Zhang Naiqi in industrial and commercial circles that are not conducive to socialist transformation.

Industry and Commerce Smoothly Completed the First Step of Socialist Transformation

I deeply realize that since our country's liberation, the policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has always been correctly implemented through peaceful means, implementing a redemption policy, and treating the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie as contradictions among the people. Facts have proved that the arrangements for industry and commerce are comprehensive considerations, and through processing orders and state purchase and marketing, the blind production and profit-seeking business methods of private industry and commerce have been initially changed, enabling industrialists and businessmen to recognize the superiority of the socialist planned economy. Private industry and commerce have developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and thus private industry and commerce have played a role in restoring production and supplying the market. However, some people have committed serious errors under the control of the psychology of seeking profits. The Five-Anti education has greatly improved the ideological awareness of the majority of industrialists and businessmen. In the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, industrialists and businessmen saw that the country was becoming increasingly prosperous and its international status was unprecedentedly improved, so their patriotic enthusiasm was high. In October 1955, Chairman Mao made important instructions to the industrial and commercial circles at the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, requiring industrialists and businessmen to understand the laws of social development, master their own destiny, and industrialists and businessmen across the country generally studied Chairman Mao's important instructions, recognized their future, listened to Chairman Mao, followed the Communist Party, and resolutely took the socialist road. After less than half a year, a climax of joint state-private ownership in all industries was set off across the country, and industrialists, businessmen and their families across the country beat gongs and drums and jubilantly leaped into socialism. The arrival of the climax of joint state-private ownership is the result of the state's correct implementation of Article 10 of the Constitution...the state adopts the policy of utilization, restriction and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce... This is an exciting event. However, because the situation of joint state-private ownership throughout the country developed too quickly, it brought a series of problems, such as merger of factories and joint operations, inventory of assets, personnel arrangements, and economic restructuring. Everyone has little experience in these issues. Under the encouragement of excitement, there are deviations in the work in some places, mainly manifested in the uncoordinated production cooperation and the greed for large mergers of factories and stores. This is caused by insufficient understanding of the central policy and insufficient consideration of the specific situation. In general, the achievements of joint state-private ownership of all industries are huge, as Premier's report pointed out, "70,000 private industrial enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises, and nearly 2 million private large, medium and small stores have been transformed into joint state-private stores, cooperative groups, or directly into state-owned stores. This is a great revolution to change the private ownership of the means of production for thousands of years into public ownership," and basically completed the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production. Industry and commerce smoothly completed the first step of socialist transformation. This great achievement is of international significance.

Private personnel after joint state-private ownership have been arranged, and most people are satisfied. Under the leadership of the public side and the help of employees, they have played a positive role and are willing to contribute their production technology and business talents. However, there are also negative aspects. Some people are not concerned about the company and are not responsible for their duties. Also, because the relationship between the public and private sides is both a relationship and a class relationship, this is a new and complex relationship that needs to be continuously improved. There is a general demand for private personnel to participate in learning after joint ventures. Under the guidance and assistance of relevant departments, some have left their jobs to join socialist political schools to study, some have participated in political training courses, and some have studied with employees in the company. Industrialists and businessmen have initially understood the goal of breaking capitalism and establishing socialism is to give up exploitation as soon as possible and become a self-reliant laborer.

The Ideological Remolding of Industrial and Commercial Circles is a Long-term and Arduous Struggle

At present, although the socialist transformation of industrial and commercial enterprises has been basically resolved, further conditions must be created to prepare to give up the final exploitation of "fixed interest" and transform joint ventures into state-owned enterprises to completely complete socialist transformation. The bourgeoisie will definitely be eliminated, and personal ideology must be transformed. This is the truth that industrialists and businessmen understand, but there are differences in the attitude of accepting transformation. Some people seriously study the position, viewpoint and method of the working class, while others are arrogant and complacent, thinking that they have their own set. There are progressive, intermediate, and backward differences in ideological understanding, and the industry itself has large, medium, and small economic positions. Therefore, the ideological transformation work of industrial and commercial circles is a long-term and arduous struggle. It is hoped that the relevant departments responsible for the ideological transformation of industrial and commercial circles can seriously study and strengthen political and ideological education work in light of the ideological development and changes of industrial and commercial circles, and help industrialists and businessmen to smoothly go through the transition period and become glorious laborers in socialist society.

It is certain that industrialists and businessmen are determined to take the socialist road, and my country's socialist economic foundation has been established. Most people in the ideological consciousness of industrialists and businessmen have not yet changed, so when observing things and handling problems, they often show an unstable socialist stance, ideological fluctuations, and when encountering problems related to personal interests, they do not consider collective interests and long-term interests enough, and even some people have a resistant attitude towards accepting socialist transformation. The rightists have ulterior motives to use the weaknesses of the wavering mood of industrialists and businessmen to sow discord and hinder the ideological progress of industrial and commercial circles. For example, Zhang Naiqi, the most stubborn element among the rightists, as the vice-chairman and minister of the Ministry of Food of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, specializes in publishing fallacies in the industrial and commercial circles, to seize the arrogant and ideologically backward elements in the industrial and commercial circles as his masses. Zhang Naiqi published his fallacies in a concealed manner, using rhetoric to beautify the bourgeoisie, such as saying that capitalists have had Tao Zhu's legacy of Fan Li and Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya's style of Bao Shuya, and now they are red capitalists, and that the bourgeoisie has handed over the means of production without nostalgia and entered socialism, which is more glorious than those who shout slogans and paste slogans empty-handed, and also proposed that the Chinese national bourgeoisie should have the spirit of liberating all mankind! Zhang Naiqi consciously praised the bourgeoisie in this way, on the one hand, he wanted to win over the masses, and on the other hand, he wanted to elevate himself.

Zhang Naiqi Uses Revisionism to Induce Industrialists and Businessmen to Take the Capitalist Road

Zhang Naiqi, in response to the fact that some industrialists and businessmen are unwilling to listen to the theory that there are still class relations, there is still exploitation, and they need to continue to accept transformation, he created a set of fallacies, such as proposing that the difference between leaders and those led can only be the difference between advanced and backward, there is no essential difference between capitalists and workers, and fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income; Zhang Naiqi also supported the suggestion to ask the state to extend the fixed interest to twenty years and pay it off at once, saying that it is for socialism and has enthusiasm. It is no longer possible to mention the transformation of rebirth, and some people in the industrial and commercial circles wrote articles saying what to learn from workers? Workers have nothing to learn. Zhang Naiqi recommended this article. Zhang Naiqi's fallacy, which caters to the fact that some industrialists and businessmen who are not humble in transformation like to listen to, and covers up for the industrial and commercial circles, is confusing, anesthetizing and deceiving to the industrial and commercial circles, making industrialists and businessmen lose their way forward and want to return to the capitalist road.

Zhang Naiqi is not satisfied with the leadership of the Communist Party. When the Party proposed long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and some democratic parties requested the Party to strengthen leadership, Zhang Naiqi called those who asked the Party to strengthen leadership "offsetters." He said that it was right to ask the Party to improve leadership; Zhang Naiqi everywhere publicized that his position as Minister of Food was obtained through struggle, and asked the industrial and commercial circles to fight against the leadership. Now the private personnel in the joint state-private enterprises advocate withdrawing the public representatives, which is the result of Zhang Naiqi's remarks. Zhang Naiqi's arrogant remarks are playing a destructive role in the acceptance of transformation by industrialists and businessmen.

Zhang Naiqi is frantically attacking the Party during the Party's rectification opportunity. First, he attacked the People's Daily, asking how much dogmatism there is. Zhang Naiqi is attacking Marxism-Leninism in the name of anti-dogmatism with the essence of revisionism. Zhang Naiqi spreads anti-socialist fallacies from the capitalist position, but Zhang Naiqi's conspiracy to spread remarks that are not conducive to socialist transformation is not easy to identify. For example, in the recently published "On the Two-Sidedness of the Chinese National Bourgeoisie" in the sixth issue of the Industrial and Commercial Circles, the article begins with: "After the industrialists and businessmen listened to Chairman Mao's speech at the Eleventh Expanded Supreme State Conference..." Then it is mixed with his various fallacies to confuse people. At the end, he said, "I hope that everyone can base on the spirit of Chairman Mao's book 'Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society'..." In his article, Zhang Naiqi quoted Chairman Mao's words at the beginning and the end, and used anti-socialist remarks in the middle to confuse and deceive the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to fall for his tricks and become his prisoners, and be lured by him to take the old capitalist road again. This road is the road of aggression, oppression, and enslavement that Chinese industrialists and businessmen were in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal period. How dangerous and terrible is the road that Zhang Naiqi wants to lead Chinese industrialists and businessmen to take with revisionism! However, Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist remarks cannot withstand criticism. Exposing him will awaken those who have been deceived by him and realize that he is backfiring on them and hindering their progress. We must continue to criticize Zhang Naiqi's anti-socialist remarks and actions. He regards himself as a right-wing strategist, such as encouraging Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping and others to adhere to their reactionary positions. We must resolutely fight against all rightists and never stop until we win a complete victory. This is a struggle between two roads, socialism and capitalism, so that the vast number of industrialists and businessmen can distinguish right from wrong and draw a clear line between politics and ideology with Zhang Naiqi and others. We are determined to take the socialist road and strive forward in accordance with the "Five Basic Principles" adopted by the All-China Federation Congress and contribute all our strength to socialist construction!

### 章乃器在给工商界帮倒忙

    章乃器在给工商界帮倒忙
    工商业者多数人在观察事物处理问题上，经常表现社会主义立场不稳，思想波动，甚至有的人对社会主义改造有抵触情绪。章乃器迎合这种情况制造了一套谬论，争取群众抬高自己。
    巩天民的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，并对关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告、关于一九五七年国民经济计划的报告、最高人民检察院工作报告、最高人民法院工作报告、全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告表示同意。
    现在我谈谈国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的伟大成就，同时对右派顽固分子章乃器在工商界中散布的不利于社会主义改造的反动言论提出批判。
    工商界顺利地走完了社会主义改造的第一步
    我深深地体会到我们国家自解放以来对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的方针一直是在正确地贯彻通过和平道路，实行赎买政策的，把工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾当作人民内部矛盾来处理的。事实证明对工商界的安排是统筹兼顾，通过加工订货、统购包销初步转变了私营工商业的盲目生产、追逐利润的经营方法，使工商业者认识了社会主义计划经济的优越性。私营工商业在国营经济的领导下有了发展，因而私营工商业在恢复生产供应市场方面起了作用。但也有些人在唯利是图的心理支配下犯了严重错误。五反教育使广大工商业者思想觉悟大大地提高了一步。在抗美援朝，镇压反革命斗争中取得胜利，工商业者看到国家日趋富强，国际地位空前提高，因而爱国热情高涨。一九五五年十月毛主席在全国工商联执委会上对工商界作了重要指示，要工商业者懂得社会发展规律，掌握自己命运，全国工商业者普遍地学习了毛主席的重要指示，认清了前途，听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，坚决走社会主义道路。经过不到半年的时间在全国范围掀起全行业公私合营高潮，全国的工商业者及其家属敲锣打鼓，欢欣鼓舞的跃进了社会主义。公私合营的高潮到来是国家正确实行宪法第十条……国家对资本主义工商业采取利用，限制和改造的政策……的成果，这是一件振奋人心的大事。但是因为全国公私合营的形势发展太快，带来一系列问题，如并厂联营、清产核资、人事安排、经济改组等，对这些问题大家经验不多。在兴奋的心情鼓舞下有些地方工作上是有偏差的，主要表现在生产协作失调，并厂并店贪大，是体会中央政策不够，考虑具体情况不周造成的。总的说来全行业公私合营成绩是巨大的，正如总理报告中指出的“七万户私营工业企业已经变为公私合营企业，将近二百万户的私营大中小商店已经变为公私合营商店、合作小组或者直接变为国营商店。这是把几千年的生产资料私有制变为公有制的大革命”，基本上完成了对生产资料私有制的社会主义改造，工商界顺利地走完了社会主义改造的第一步，这一伟大成就是具有国际意义的。
    公私合营后的私方人员都得到安排，大多数人感到满意，在公方领导和职工帮助下发挥了积极性，愿意把生产技术经营才能贡献出来，但也有消极一面，有些人对企业不关心，对职务不负责，也因为公私共事关系又有阶级关系，这是一个新的而又复杂的关系，是要经过不断地改进的。私方人员合营后参加学习有普遍的要求，在有关部门指导协助下，现在有脱产加入社会主义政治学校学习的，有参加政治讲习班学习的，也有在企业内同职工一道学习的。工商业者初步懂得了破资本主义、立社会主义，奋斗的目标是早日放弃剥削成为一个自食其力的劳动者。
    工商界的思想改造是长期的艰巨的斗争
    目前工商业企业方面虽然社会主义改造基本上解决，进一步要创造条件，准备放弃最后的剥削“定息”，把合营企业变为国营企业，彻底完成社会主义改造。资产阶级肯定消灭，个人思想必须改造，这是工商业者都懂得的道理，但在接受改造的态度上是有所不同的，有的人是认真学习工人阶级立场观点方法，也有的人骄傲自满，认为自己有一套。在思想认识上有进步、中间、落后的分别，在业者本身又有大中小的经济地位，因此工商界的思想改造工作是个长期艰巨的斗争，希望负有对工商界思想改造有关部门，能针对工商界思想发展变化的情况，认真地研究加强政治思想教育工作，帮助工商业者平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，变成为社会主义社会的光荣的劳动者。
    工商业者坚决走社会主义道路是肯定了的，我国的社会主义经济基础已建立起来了，在工商业者思想意识多数人还没转变过来，因此在观察事物处理问题上经常表现走社会主义的立场不稳、思想波动，遇到与个人利害有关的问题时考虑集体利益、长远利益照顾的不到，甚至有的人对接受社会主义改造有抵触情绪。右派分子就别有用心地利用工商业者的摇摆心情的弱点，进行挑拨离间阻碍工商界思想进步。如右派中最顽固分子章乃器身为中国民主建国会和全国工商联两会的副主任委员、国家粮食部部长，专门在工商界中发表谬论，要抓住工商界中骄傲自大思想落后的分子作他的群众，章乃器发表他的谬论是用隐蔽手法，用花言巧语来美化资产阶级，如说资本家从古来就有陶朱遗范管鲍遗风实业救国的美德，现在已是红色资产阶级，又说资产阶级交出生产资料毫无留恋进入社会主义，比赤手空拳喊口号贴标语的人要光荣些，还提出中国民族资产阶级要有解放全人类的气概！章乃器有意识地这样捧资产阶级，一方面他要争取群众，另一方面也抬高他自己。
    章乃器用修正主义引诱工商业者走资本主义道路
    章乃器针对着有一部分工商业者不愿意听还有阶级关系，还有剥削，要继续接受改造的理论，他就制造一套谬论，如提出领导者被领导者的区别只能是先进与落后的区别，资本家同工人没有本质的区别了，定息不是剥削是不劳而获的收入；章乃器还支持向国家要求把定息延长到二十年一次付清的建议，说是为了社会主义，有积极性。不能再提脱胎换骨改造了，工商界中有人写文章说向工人学习什么？工人没什么可学的。章乃器推荐这篇文章。章乃器这种迎合一部分不虚心改造的工商业者爱听的谬论，并为工商界打掩护，对工商界是迷惑麻醉欺骗，使工商业者迷失前进方向要回到资本主义老路。
    章乃器不满意共产党的领导，在党提出长期共存互相监督，有民主党派要求党加强领导，章乃器把对党要求加强领导的人叫作抵销派，他说对党要求提高领导就对了；章乃器到处宣扬他的粮食部长有职有权是斗争得来的，要求工商界要对领导斗争，现在公私合营企业里的私方人员主张撤出公方代表，这是章乃器论调鼓动出来的，章乃器的狂妄言论对工商业者接受改造是起着破坏作用的。
    章乃器在党开展整风的机会他是向党猖狂进攻，首先攻击人民日报问有多少教条主义，章乃器是以反教条主义为名用修正主义的本质向马列主义进攻。章乃器站在资本主义立场来散布反社会主义谬论，但是章乃器散布不利于社会主义改造言论的阴谋手段是很不容易识别的，如最近在工商界第六期上发表的“关于中国民族资产阶级的两面性问题”，这篇文章一开头是：“工商业家听了毛主席在第十一次扩大最高国务会议上的讲话之后……，”往下面即夹杂上他的各种谬论迷惑人，在最后他又说“我希望大家能够根据毛主席所著的‘中国社会各阶级的分析’的精神……”，章乃器在他的这一篇文章里，头尾都引用毛主席的话，中间用反社会主义言论来迷惑欺骗广大工商业者来上他的当，作他的俘虏，被他引诱再走资本主义老路，这个路就是过去中国工商业家处在半殖民地半封建时期受侵略、压迫，被奴役的道路。章乃器要用修正主义引领中国工商业家走的道路是多么危险可怕的道路！但是章乃器的反社会主义言论是经不住批判的，我们给他揭露了就使受他欺骗的人觉醒过来，认识是给他们帮倒忙、阻碍他们进步的。我们必须对章乃器的反社会主义言论行动继续批判，他是以右派谋士自居，如鼓励章伯钧、储安平等人坚持反动立场。我们必须向一切右派分子坚决斗争，不彻底胜利决不收兵。这是社会主义和资本主义之间的两条道路的斗争，使广大工商业者能明辨是非，与章乃器等划清政治思想界限。我们坚决走社会主义道路，根据全联代表大会通过的“五项基本准则”努力前进，为社会主义建设贡献出我们的一切力量！
