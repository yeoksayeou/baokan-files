Discovering Mistakes, Earnestly Conducting Self-Criticism
*Xinmin Bao* Examines Errors in Distorting the Truth of the "Letting Out" in Zhejiang

(Reported by *Xinmin Bao*) According to news from *Xinmin Bao*: the Hangzhou dispatches of May 20th, "*Letting Out* Winds Have Not Yet Reached Zhejiang" and the May 21st article "Gazing at the City Walls of Hangzhou from Geling" were two reports that distorted the truth and exaggerated facts. This is the conclusion *Xinmin Bao* reached after verifying facts with various parties and conducting investigations and research in Hangzhou during its recent inspection work.

The *Xinmin Bao* dispatch of May 20th stated: "Contrary to the situation of extensive *letting out* and *voicing* in Shanghai, the *voicing* and *letting out* in Zhejiang has not had much movement so far." "The Provincial Party Committee has not yet clearly expressed support for the contention. Leading comrades of the Provincial Party Committee have also not come forward to preside over meetings, allowing intellectuals inside and outside the Party to raise opinions." The May 21st report also mentioned: "Some leading comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee are afraid of seeing the exposure of contradictions, always hoping that fewer people raise opinions – there is no other way than to *let out* less or not *let out* at all, not allowing people to speak. When someone raises an opinion, they are given a big label by rude cadres. From the recent convening of the Provincial Party Committee's propaganda work conference to the unfolding of the rectification study, it seems to be proceeding silently, differing from the spirit of 'preventing closed-door rectification' mentioned in the Central Committee's instructions on rectification and the methods of the National Propaganda Conference." The report also said: "After the propaganda conference, the Provincial Party Committee has not convened a single symposium of intellectuals." The Provincial Party Committee's "First Secretary does not pay enough attention to the leadership of ideological work." These words are actually without basis.

The Truth of "Letting Out" in Zhejiang: Not That the Wind Hadn't Reached, But Rather It Was Very Lively

What is the truth of the matter?

In May, Zhejiang Province, under the vigorous support of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the personal leadership of the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Jiang Hua, was a time when *letting out* and *voicing* were very lively. This can be seen not only from the full-page news reports and speeches of people from all walks of life in the *Zhejiang Daily* in May, but even Song Yunbin, the chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, who claimed that he had not received a notice to attend the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Conference and declared on May 21st that he "would *voice* a bit before leaving," also expressed deep emotion and encouragement at the Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on "*voicing*" at a symposium personally presided over by Comrade Jiang Hua.

As early as April 15th, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee held a four-day Provincial Party Committee plenary session to seriously study how to implement Chairman Mao's speech at the Eleventh Enlarged Meeting of the Supreme State Conference. In addition to deciding to quickly convey this report to the entire province, the meeting also decided that the First Secretary would personally lead ideological work and intellectual work. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also convened meetings of county and city Party secretaries and cadres above the level of county and city heads, as well as a propaganda work conference with more than 1,500 Party and non-Party comrades participating. The main content of the meeting was to convey and seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's speech. At that Provincial Party Committee propaganda work conference, everyone was not completely without concerns about "*voicing*" and "*letting out*" at the beginning, but after studying, especially after listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, the atmosphere of *letting out* and *voicing* in Zhejiang began to become active. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, Sha Wenhan, Governor of Zhejiang Province, Yang Siyi, Deputy Governor, Lü Laoxian, Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, and secretaries of various localities and cities also convened symposiums of Party and non-Party comrades or symposiums in various regions according to their respective business systems, humbly soliciting everyone's opinions. At that time, because it happened to coincide with the visit of Elder Fu to Hangzhou, everyone was very busy with work, and coupled with the fact that Premier Zhou's report basically solved everyone's ideological problems, everyone agreed to put the speeches at the upcoming First Session of the Third Provincial CPPCC Committee. On April 19th and 20th, the Standing Committee of the Provincial CPPCC also held meetings to listen to reports from various democratic parties on the conveying and discussion of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. Comrade Jiang Hua also gave a speech in his capacity as Chairman of the Provincial CPPCC before the meeting concluded. The meeting decided that the central topic of this CPPCC session was how to correctly handle contradictions among the people and promote the province's national construction work.

On May 2nd, the plenary session of the Provincial CPPCC officially opened. The *Zhejiang Daily*, the organ newspaper of the Provincial Party Committee, published an editorial entitled "*Dare to 'Let Out', Dare to 'Voice', 'Let Out' More, 'Voice' More*," congratulating the opening of the plenary session of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPPCC. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the Provincial CPPCC, also told the attending members and delegates about his personal experience in studying Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the preparatory meeting of the CPPCC, and also introduced the situation of the meetings of county and city Party secretaries and cadres above the level of county and city heads. Finally, he sincerely hoped that everyone would, in the spirit of "knowing everything, saying everything, the speaker is not guilty, the listener is warned," speak out on all issues, extensively carry out discussions, and study ways to correctly handle them. He called on everyone to greatly "*let out*" and greatly "*voice*", negotiate with each other, and jointly do things well.

This meeting was held for nearly half a month, and did not officially close until May 15th. During the meeting, Comrade Jiang Hua not only participated in the conference from beginning to end, seriously listening to everyone's speeches, but also took turns to listen to everyone's opinions in various groups during group discussions. Comrade Jiang Hua attached great importance to the opinions of literary and art workers, so he also specially convened a symposium of the literary and art circles lasting four days during the meeting. Song Yunbin also participated in this lively contention meeting and openly expressed that he was very moved.

Reporters from *Zhejiang Daily* originally had some concerns about reporting the news of the CPPCC's great *letting out* and *voicing*, but Comrade Jiang Hua repeatedly encouraged and supported them. Comrade Jiang Hua also criticized local newspapers that did not attach importance to "*voicing*" and had fewer news reports.

The Provincial Party Committee Emphasizes Opinions from All Sectors and Gradually Improves Literary and Art Work

After the CPPCC closed, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, in conjunction with the deployment of rectification, made a decision to entrust its subordinate departments to continue to convene various symposiums to listen to opinions from various parties, including democratic parties, the press, and the literary and art circles. Taking the cultural circles as an example, according to Comrade Wang Guming, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Culture, immediately after the great *letting out* and *voicing* of the CPPCC's literary and art group, symposiums of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, working cadres of the Provincial Department of Culture, the art circles, and the music circles were successively convened. The Provincial Department of Culture also convened a provincial administrative meeting on cultural work to listen to everyone's opinions. At the meeting, Deputy Governor Yang Siyi made decisions on the spot on some major problems that were exposed. For example, according to everyone's opinions, it was decided to establish cultural sections separately in thirty-three large counties with a good cultural foundation, such as Dongyang, which is famous for wood carvings, Sheng County, the birthplace of Yue opera, and Qingtian, which is famous for stone carvings (currently being handled by the establishment committee). Specific problems such as the inability of literary and art groups to carry out activities normally in rural areas have also been included in the key work of the Provincial Department of Culture in the second half of this year. Other problems, those that can be solved on the spot have been solved, and those that cannot be solved for the time being are being classified and sorted, and dealt with according to their importance, urgency, and priority. Wang Guming, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Culture, said that several directors of the Cultural Department are going deep into the grassroots to listen to opinions, and the schedule has been arranged until the end of July.

It can be seen that Zhejiang Province, because of its specific conditions being different from Shanghai, also has some differences in its approach. Shanghai held small symposiums first, and then large conferences; Zhejiang held large conferences first, and then small meetings. The spirit of great *letting out* and great *voicing* is the same as that of Shanghai. As for whether the degree of "*voicing*" and "*letting out*" is deep and thorough? That is another issue to be studied.

What Kind of Person Is Song Yunbin?

Several issues in the May 20th and 21st dispatches and reports were related to Song Yunbin, and Song himself also wrote an article entitled "Isn't This Still Sectarianism?" and submitted it to *Xinmin Bao* for publication (published on May 21st).

What kind of person is Song Yunbin?

Song Yunbin is a "popular figure" in Zhejiang Province who holds more than a dozen positions. His titles include Vice Chairman of the Provincial CPPCC, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Director of the Provincial Sports Commission, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and Representative of the National People's Congress... The Party and the people have indeed attached great importance to him.

However, judging from the erroneous words and deeds of Song Yunbin that have been exposed at a series of recent symposiums convened by the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, he is actually a figure who opposes the Party. After Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks were attacked, Song Yunbin publicly came out to defend Zhang Bojun, saying that it was a slip of the tongue and should not be compared with Chu Anping. After the *People's Daily* published an editorial on June 8th about the threat letter received by Lu Yuwen, Song Yunbin openly pointed out that the *People's Daily* had "fallen into a trap." He believed that the publication of this editorial had a very bad effect, making people afraid to "*voice*" and "*let out*" anymore. He once said to Hu Yi of the Organization Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League: "The Communist Party's arrival is the most unfortunate thing for cultural people!"

Factual Errors in *Xinmin Bao*'s Reports, Verified and Corrected After Investigation

Now let's go back and look at the fact that Song Yunbin has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with, scolded the Party for "sectarianism," and said that he himself "did not receive a notice" when the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Conference was convened! According to our investigation, the main content of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Conference was to convey Chairman Mao's two speeches, and an attendance certificate was issued to Song Yunbin in advance, and written documents of Chairman Mao's two reports were also sent. The Municipal Sports Commission sent the attendance certificate and documents to his home, but his family returned it to the Sports Commission because he was away on official business and did not receive it. At a recent enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Weng Xinhui, Chairman of the Ningbo Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, talked about this matter and criticized *Xinmin Bao* for reporting inaccurately in this regard.

As for literary and art work, it is indeed a fact that Zhejiang Province arbitrarily denied drama programs and managed them too strictly. However, this was before "*voicing*" and "*letting out*", and after the Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the Provincial Department of Culture had already begun to correct deviations and the repertoire work has been improved. However, Song Yunbin has always been brooding about this, deliberately repeatedly settling old scores and confusing the public.

The allegation that dragon lanterns and lion dances were banned by leaders on the pretext of being divorced from politics is also somewhat inconsistent with the facts. According to the Provincial Department of Culture, Zhejiang has an organization of folk song and dance troupes, whose main task is to conduct demonstration performances throughout the province, and use their performances to inspire and carry out mass cultural activities. As a demonstration troupe, with only traditional programs such as dragon lanterns and lion dances and nothing that reflects the real life of the masses, the relevant departments believed that it was inappropriate, so they suggested that they add some new things reflecting the struggles of the masses to the program; however, the song and dance troupe believed that the new things were artistically poor and had ideological resistance; later, facts proved that since adding some new programs, what was most popular with the masses was not dragon lanterns and lion dances but storytelling.

Comrades from the Party Committee of the Academy of Fine Arts told us that the so-called integration of the Chinese Painting Department and the Western Painting Department of the Academy of Fine Arts was actually the merger of the two departments into a single Painting Department. Therefore, if one must say that the Chinese Painting Department was merged into the Western Painting Department, then the Western Painting Department can also be said to have been merged into the Chinese Painting Department. They also told us that last month our newspaper said that Mr. Huang Binhong's lecture notes had to be submitted for review in advance for fear that he would instill "poison" into the students, which was also a distortion of the facts. According to the Academy of Fine Arts' system, the lecture outlines of all professors' courses must be discussed in the teaching and research group in advance, but not submitted for review, let alone only for Mr. Huang. As for the fact that a Chinese painting professor was demoted to a clerk, as reported by *Xinmin Bao*, it was only that Zhu Lesan, an associate professor of Chinese painting, had no classes for a period of one or two years and had served as deputy section chief of the Academic Affairs Section for a few months, and later taught again.

The problem of caring for the old writer Chen Xuezhao has actually been solved long ago. She now lives in a small Western-style house built on the hillside of Da Tueer Mountain next to the West Lake, and she can see the picturesque Su Causeway standing by the window. When we visited her, she was working at her desk to create a 200,000-word novel. When Zhejiang's "*voicing*" and "*letting out*" were carried out, Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, also personally talked to her once. Recently, Comrade Jiang Hua also entrusted her to convene a symposium of provincial and municipal literary and art figures to enthusiastically discuss the leadership of improving Zhejiang's literary and art work.

As for the paper issue of the Donghai Literary and Art Publishing House mentioned in other reports, it was actually agreed to increase it to 3,000 reams at that time. There is also the report that Li Yizhong, chairman of the Hangzhou Musicians Association during the Anti-Japanese War and an old musician, is now an ordinary administrative cadre in the Cultural Bureau. In fact, Li did not serve as chairman of the Musicians Association during the Anti-Japanese War, but once served as vice chairman of the Hangzhou Musicians Association after liberation. Later, he served as the leader of the music group in the Provincial Department of Culture. Shortly before the anti-rebel campaign, the music group was abolished. Because he had some historical problems that needed to be investigated, he was not assigned a job. He is now the deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Provincial Musicians Association. As for the report that the three-month creative vacation for comrades of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was changed to one month by the Provincial Party Committee, this was actually modified by the deputy secretary-general of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles himself, and the Provincial Party Committee did not make such a decision at all. *Xinmin Bao* has already corrected this in the newspaper.

*Xinmin Bao* Will Conduct In-depth Examination of Bourgeois Journalistic Views

When reporting these things, *Xinmin Bao* had serious bourgeois journalistic views, and the reports were based only on one-sided materials without verification. In terms of reporting ideology, it only focused on the shortcomings of the work and turned a blind eye to the achievements. Some of the objects visited by the reporter had dissatisfaction or even opposed the Party, which resulted in seriously erroneous news reports in the newspaper. This should be thoroughly examined.

    发现错误，认真进行自我批判
    新民报检查歪曲浙江鸣放真象的错误
    本报讯　据新民报消息：新民报5月20日杭州专电：“放、鸣风还没有吹到浙江”和21日的“从葛岭瞻望杭州城的城墙”是两篇歪曲真象、夸张失实的报道。这是新民报最近在检查工作中，到杭州与各方面核对事实、调查研究后得出的结论。
    新民报5月20日的专电上说：“跟上海的大放大鸣情况相反，浙江的鸣放，至今还没有多大动静。”“省委至今还没有明白表示支持争鸣。省委负责同志也没有出面主持会议，让党内外知识分子提意见。”5月21日的报道中也提到：“浙江省委有些领导同志却怕看见矛盾的揭露，总是希望提意见的人越少越好，——这没有别的办法，只好少放或不放，不让人发言，有人提了意见，被粗暴的干部扣上大帽子。从最近省委宣传工作会议的召开到整风学习的展开，好像都还是无声无息地在进行，和中央关于整风指示中说的‘防止关门整风’的精神和全国宣传会议的方式，都有所差异”。报道中又说：“宣传会议以后，省委没有出面召开过一次知识分子的座谈会。”省委“第一书记对思想工作的领导是不够重视的。”这些话其实都没有根据。
    浙江鸣放真象：不是风未吹到，而是十分热闹
    事实的真象怎样呢？
    5月间，是浙江全省在中共浙江省委的大力支持和省委第一书记江华同志的亲自领导下，大鸣大放十分热闹的时候。这不仅可以从5月份浙江日报上一整版一整版的新闻报道和各界人士的发言中看出来，就连自称未获出席浙江省委宣传会议通知、在5月21日还宣称“要鸣一鸣才走”的省文联主席宋云彬，也曾在一次江华同志亲自主持的座谈会上对省委重视“鸣放”表示深为感动，很受鼓舞。
    早在4月15日，中共浙江省委就举行了四天省委全体会议，认真研究如何贯彻毛主席在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上的讲话。会上除决定迅速向全省传达这个报告外，并决定第一书记亲自领导思想工作和知识分子工作。与此同时，省委还分头召开了县、市委书记和县、市长以上的干部会议和有一千五百多位党内、外同志参加的宣传工作会议，会议的主要内容是传达和认真学习、讨论毛主席的讲话。那次省委宣传工作会议上，开头大家对“鸣”、“放”不是完全没有顾虑的，可是后来经过学习，特别是听了周恩来总理的讲话后，浙江省放、鸣的空气就开始活跃起来了。中共浙江省委第一书记江华、省长沙文汉、副省长杨思一、省委宣传部长吕老先和各地、市委书记还按各业务系统分别召开了党内、外同志座谈会或各地区座谈会，虚心征求大家的意见。当时因为刚巧碰上伏老访问杭州，大家工作很忙，再加上周总理的报告基本上解决了大家的思想问题，大家都同意把发言放到即将召开的省政协一届三次会议上去。4月19、20日两天，省政协常委会也举行会议，听取了各民主党派对毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的传达和讨论情况的汇报。江华同志也在会议结束前以省政协主席的身份讲了话。会议决定这次政协的中心议题是如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，推进本省各项国家建设工作。
      5月2日，省政协全体会议正式开幕。省委机关报浙江日报即以
  “敢‘放’敢‘鸣’，多‘放’多‘鸣’”为题发表了社论，祝贺政协浙江省委员会全体会议开幕。省委第一书记、省政协主席江华也在政协预备会议上向到会委员和列席代表讲述了个人学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告的体会，而且介绍了县、市委书记和县、市长以上干部会议的情况。最后他并诚恳的希望大家本着“知无不言、言无不尽、言者无罪、闻者足戒”的精神，把所有的问题都讲出来，广泛地开展讨论，研究正确处理的途径。号召大家大“放”大“鸣”，互相协商，共同办好事情。
    这次会议先后举行了将近半个月，一直到5月15日才正式闭幕。在会议进行期间，江华同志不仅从头到尾参加大会，认真听取了大家的发言，而且还在小组讨论时轮流到各个小组听取大家的意见。江华同志十分重视文艺工作者的意见，所以还在会议期间专门召开了一个历时四天的文艺界座谈会，宋云彬也参加了这个争鸣热烈的会议，并且公开表示很受感动。
    浙江日报记者对于报道政协大鸣大放新闻原来有些顾虑，江华同志曾一再加以鼓励和支持。对于不重视“鸣”、“放”新闻报道较少的地方报纸，江华同志还曾提出批评。
    省委重视各界意见逐步改进文艺工作
    当政协闭幕后，中共浙江省委又结合部署整风作出决定，委托所属各部继续召开了各种座谈会，听取各民主党派、新闻界、文艺界等各方面的意见。就以文化界方面来说吧，据省文化局副局长王顾明同志说，紧接着政协文艺小组的大鸣大放以后，又先后召开了省文联、省文化局工作干部、美术界、音乐界等座谈会。省文化局也召开了全省文化工作行政会议，听取大家的意见，会上，杨思一副省长并当场对揭发出来的一些重大问题作出了决定，例如根据大家的意见，决定在文化基础较好的三十三个大县如以木刻出名的东阳、越剧的发源地嵊县、以石刻出名的青田等县单独建立文化科（现正由编制委员会具体处理中）。文艺团体下乡不能够正常开展活动等具体问题也已经列入省文化局今年下半年的重点工作之内。其他问题，凡是能当场解决的都已经解决，凡是一时不能够解决的，也正在分类排队，分别轻、重、缓、急加以处理。省文化局副局长王顾明说，文化局几个局长正在深入各基层听取意见，日程已经排到7月底。
    由此可见，浙江省因为具体条件和上海不同，因此在做法上也有些不同。上海是先开小型座谈会，再开大会；浙江是先开大会，再开小会。而大鸣大放的精神是和上海一样的。至于“鸣”、“放”的程度深不深，透不透？那是要另外去研究的一个问题了。
    宋云彬是怎样的一个人？
    5月20、21日的专电、报道中有好几个问题是与宋云彬有关的，宋本人也曾经以“这难道还不是宗派主义吗？”为题作文交新民报发表（5月21日刊出）。
    宋云彬是怎样一个人呢？
    宋云彬是浙江省里身兼十几个职务的“红人”，他的头衔有省政协副主席、省文联主席、省体委主任、民盟省委副主任委员、全国人民代表大会代表……党和人民的确是对他很器重的了。
    但是从最近民盟省委一连串召开的座谈会上揭发出来的宋云彬错误言行看起来，他竟是一个与党对抗的人物。当章伯钧的反动言论受到反击后，宋云彬还公开出来替章伯钧辩护，说他是一言之失，不可以同储安平相提并论。当人民日报6月8日就卢郁文收到恐吓信一事发表社论以后，宋云彬又公然指出这是人民日报“中了计”，他认为这篇社论发表后作用很坏，使人看了不敢再“鸣”、“放”下去了。他曾对民盟杭州市委组织部的胡齮说：“共产党来，文化人最不幸！”
    新民报报道中的事实错误，经调查后核实纠正
    现在再回过头来看看宋云彬所一再表示不满、骂党“宗派主义”、说浙江省委宣传会议召开时他本人竟“未获通知”这一事实吧！据我们调查，浙江省委宣传会议的主要内容是传达毛主席的两个讲话，事先是发了出席证给宋云彬的，而且还发去了毛主席两个报告的书面文件。市体委曾把出席证和文件送到他家去，他家里的人因为他公出在外没有收，退给体委了。最近举行的一次省民盟扩大会议上，民盟宁波市主委翁心惠就谈到这件事，并批评了新民报在这方面报道失实。
    至于文艺工作方面，浙江省随便否定戏目，管理过严，这的确也是事实。不过这是“鸣”“放”以前的事情，在中央提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以后，省文化局方面早就开始纠偏了，剧目工作也已有所改进。但宋云彬却对此一直耿耿于怀，故意一再算旧账，混淆视听。
    所说龙灯、狮子舞被领导上借口脱离政治禁演一节，也与事实有些出入。据省文化局方面说，浙江有一个民间歌舞团的组织，主要任务是在全省作巡回示范演出，通过他们的演出来启发和开展群众文艺活动。作为一个示范剧团，只有龙灯、狮子舞等传统节目，完全没有反映群众现实生活的东西，有关部门认为是不恰当的，因此建议他们在节目中增加一些新的反映群众斗争的东西；但是歌舞团方面认为新的东西艺术性差，思想上有抵触；后来事实证明，自从增加了一些新节目以后，最受群众欢迎的并不是龙灯、狮子舞而是说唱。
    美术学院党委的同志告诉我们说，所谓美术学院的国画系并进了西画系，实际上是两个系合并成为一个绘画系，因此如果一定要说国画系并进西画系的话，那么西画系也可以说成被并进国画系的。他们又告诉我们上月我报说黄宾虹老先生上课的讲稿事先要送审，怕他把“毒素”灌输给学生，这样说法也是歪曲事实的。根据美术学院的制度，凡教授之课，讲课提纲事先都要在教研组讨论，但不是送审，更不是对黄老先生一人如此。至于新民报报道中所说国画教授降为事务员一节，只是在一、二年前有个国画副教授诸乐三，因没有课，曾一度搞过几个月教务科副科长，后来又在执教了。
    对老作家陈学昭的照顾问题，其实也早已解决。她现在住在一幢建筑在西湖旁边大兔耳山腰的小洋房里，站在窗口就可以看见风景如画的苏堤，我们去访问她时，她正在伏案创作一部二十万字的长篇。浙江的“鸣”“放”开展时，省委第一书记江华也曾亲自找她谈了一次话，最近，江华同志还委托她召开了一次省、市文艺界人士的座谈会，热烈研讨了改进浙省文艺工作的领导问题。
    其它如报道中提到的东海文艺出版社的纸张问题，其实当时已同意增加到三千令了。还有报道中说抗日时期杭州音协主席、老音乐家李益中现在文化局做普通行政干部一事；其实，李在抗日时期并没有担任音协主席，倒是解放后曾一度出任杭州市的音协副主席，后来担任省文化局里的音乐组组长，在肃反前不久，音乐组撤销，因为他有些历史问题需要审查，就没有分配他工作，现在他是省音协筹委副主任。至于报道中说文联同志的三个月创作假期被省委改为一个月，其实这是文联副秘书长自己修改的，省委根本没有作过这种决定。这点，新民报已在报上更正过。
    新民报将深入检查资产阶级新闻观点
    新民报在报道这些东西时，由于存在着严重的资产阶级新闻观点，报道只根据片面材料未加核实，在报道思想上，又只着眼于工作上的缺点，对成绩视而不见。记者访问的某些对象，都是有不满情绪甚至与党对抗的，以致在报上出现有严重错误的新闻报道，这是应该深入检查的。
