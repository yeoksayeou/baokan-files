Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th - Seoul Dispatch: Encouraged by the United States' actions in undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, Syngman Rhee is once again clamoring in Seoul to "rise up and fight" to solve the so-called "Communist problem."

On June 28, Syngman Rhee told reporters from the International News Service that he "strongly agreed" and was "very grateful" for the United States' actions in lifting the restrictions in the Korean Armistice Agreement that limited the introduction of new weapons into South Korea. This action by the United States made Syngman Rhee feel "relieved." He said that South Korea's "need" for the latest weapons was "great" and that they "urgently hoped" to obtain such weapons to strengthen his forces to deal with North Korea. He believes that "now is closer to reunification than ever before."

Syngman Rhee once again admitted that he had opposed the armistice from the very beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations. He stated that he is not satisfied with the United States' unilateral abolition of part of the armistice agreement and hopes that the US President can announce to the world that "the armistice agreement is invalid."

Syngman Rhee replied to reporters that "if Korea must be used as a base for US atomic weapons," he would be "happy to discuss this issue with relevant parties."

Syngman Rhee is also eager to cheaply sell his troops to the United States as cannon fodder for invading Asia. He told reporters from the International News Service that if the United States does not want to lose the entire Asian continent like it lost mainland China, the "wisest policy" for the United States is to strengthen his army. He said that this is "very economical" for US taxpayers, and "the cost of five Korean divisions is less than the cost of one US division." At the same time, he clarified, "But this should not mean a large reduction in the US military."

    主人稍示眼色　奴才磨拳擦掌
    李承晚狂叫“奋起作战”
    并“乐意”献出原子基地和侵略炮灰
    据新华社平壤30日电　汉城消息：在美国破坏朝鲜停战的行为的鼓舞下，李承晚又在汉城叫嚣要“奋起作战”来解决所谓“共产党问题”。
    李承晚6月28日对国际新闻社的记者表示，他对美国取消朝鲜停战协定中限制把新武器运入南朝鲜的规定的行为，“非常同意”，并且“非常感激”。美国的这种行为使李承晚感到“放心了”。他说，南朝鲜对最新式的武器“需要是很大的”，并且“迫切希望”得到这种武器，以便加强他的部队来对付朝鲜北部。他认为“现在比以前任何时候都接近恢复统一了”。
    李承晚再次承认，他是从朝鲜停战谈判一开始的时候就是反对停战的。他表示，他现在并不满足于美国片面废除停战协定的一部分的做法，他希望美国总统能够向全世界宣布“停战协定已经无效”。
    李承晚答复记者说，“如果必须以韩国作为美国原子武器的基地”，他将“乐于同有关方面讨论这个问题”。
    李承晚还急于把他的部队廉价出卖给美国做侵略亚洲的炮灰，他对国际新闻社记者说，如果美国不想像失去中国大陆一样失去整个亚洲，对美国说来，“最明智的政策”是加强他的军队。他说，这对美国的纳税人来说是“很经济的”，“五师朝鲜军队的花费抵不上一师美国军队的花费”。他同时说明，“但是这并不应该意味着要大大削减美国军队”。
