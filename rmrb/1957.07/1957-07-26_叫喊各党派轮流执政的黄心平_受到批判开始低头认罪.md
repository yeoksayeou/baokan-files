(Reported by this newspaper) Huang Xinping, a rightist element and teacher at Tianjin No. 3 Women's Middle School, who once arrogantly clamored for the Communist Party and various democratic parties to alternate in power, began to confess his guilt at a meeting of all faculty and staff members of the school on the 21st. Huang Xinping admitted that after the "international storms" of the Beria affair and the Hungarian incident, he was "influenced" and "became suspicious of one-party dictatorship." After the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" and "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," he had the idea of "various parties taking turns in power through elections."

After the rectification movement began, he believed that this was a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" to attack the Party, and the "best time to lower the prestige of the Communist Party." Therefore, he proposed that "the three major isms originate from one-party dictatorship." He deliberately vilified party members and even hoped to call students to take to the streets to demonstrate. He also planned to use writing articles and running publications to expand his influence, and at the same time, he could use this to pursue fame and fortune, and hunt for "political capital." Huang Xinping had "talked to" some teachers and students in their school who liked to complain. He said that he had an "interest" in the trade union of Women's No. 3 Middle School, and attempted to use the trade union to cause trouble.

At the meeting, teachers and staff of Women's No. 3 Middle School spoke one after another, pointing out that although Huang Xinping had changed, his confession was still incomplete, and he did not explain what his purpose was, and he lacked deep criticism. They demanded that Huang Xinping thoroughly confess all his problems, make a deep self-criticism, and plead guilty to the people.

    叫喊各党派轮流执政的黄心平  受到批判开始低头认罪
    本报讯　天津市女三中教员、曾经狂妄叫嚣要共产党和各民主党派轮流执政的右派分子黄心平，在21日该校举行的全体教职员工大会上，开始低头认罪。黄心平承认：当贝利亚事件、匈牙利事件等“国际风暴”发生以后，他受了“影响”，“对一党专政发生了怀疑”。当中国共产党第八次全国代表大会提出了“长期共存、互相监督”和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针后，他就有了“各党派通过竞选轮流执政”的想法。
    整风运动开始后，他认为这是向党进攻“千载难逢的机会”，是“降低共产党威信最好的时候”。于是，他提出“三大主义是导源于一党专政”。他故意丑化党员，还希望叫学生上街游行示威。他还打算用写文章、办刊物的办法来扩大影响，同时可以借此追求名利，猎取“政治资本”。黄心平曾经找过他们校内一些爱发牢骚的师生“谈过话”。他说，他对女三中的工会发生过“兴趣”，图谋利用工会组织闹事。
    会上，女三中教师和职员纷纷发言指出黄心平虽有转变，可是交代的仍不彻底，没有说明他的目的究竟是为了什么，并且缺乏深刻的批判，要求黄心平彻底交代一切问题，并作深刻检查，向人民请罪。
