Xinhua News Agency, July 14th - The China Film Workers Association held two forums in Beijing on the 12th and 13th to counter the rightists' attack on the film industry under the leadership of the Party.

    The forum was convened by Cai Chusheng, Chairman of the Association. In his speech, he exposed the rightists' conspiracy to attack the Party's film industry and criticized the many articles and news items published in "Wenhui Bao" that incited discord between the Party and film professionals. Cai Chusheng pointed out that progressive films before liberation grew up under the leadership and influence of the Party. After liberation, the rapid development of the film industry is an obvious fact. In 1951, the poisonous films of imperialism, which had occupied the Chinese film scene for decades, were completely eliminated, and replaced by domestically produced films and translated films from socialist countries. Under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic line, workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the main subjects and main audiences of film works. Newsreels and science education films are also being produced in large quantities. He said that these great achievements cannot be denied, and some shortcomings in the work are being vigorously improved. The people's film industry of tomorrow will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements. He called on the film workers present to expose the rightists' conspiracy to attack the people's film industry in all aspects during this struggle and to refute their absurd remarks.

    At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically and unanimously expressed their utmost indignation at the conspiracy of the rightist Chen Renbing, who has now been exposed for igniting trouble in the Shanghai film industry, and expressed their strong support for the just struggle of Shanghai film workers against the rightists. In their speeches, everyone warned rightists such as Chen Renbing that if they did not thoroughly confess, they would never let him off. Actor Wei Heling exposed his participation in a forum convened by Chen Renbing in Shanghai. He said that Chen Renbing manipulated the meeting, incited discord between the Party and the masses, and stirred up actors' dissatisfaction with the Party. As soon as the meeting was over, Chen Renbing mobilized me to join the League and become his tool. Fortunately, I had been educated by the Party for a long time, so I did not fall into the trap of this rightist. Many others exposed the fact that some rightists from the China Democratic League and the Jiusan Society in Beijing attempted to ignite trouble among film workers, sow discord, and use improper means to pull people into the League and the Society. Actors Shi Lianxing and others pointed out that it was intolerable to all film workers that a rightist like Wu Yin appeared within the film industry.

    Many film workers present also pointed out in their speeches that after "Wenhui Bao" launched a discussion on films, some people in the film industry were badly affected, and even regarded anyone who agreed with socialist realism and the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "dogmatism." They demanded that the editorial department of "Wenhui Bao" make a profound self-criticism, explain the truth to readers, and reverse the adverse effects that had been caused.

    Chen Bo, Ma Shouqing, Chen Huaikai, and others exposed that "Wenhui Bao" deliberately published many articles and news that distorted facts and harmed the people's film industry. When "Wenhui Bao" launched the discussion on "Why are there so few good domestic films?" last year, it was used by the rightists to viciously slander the people's film industry, describing it as a mess, worse than before liberation. Not long ago, "Wenhui Bao's" report on the rectification of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture distorted the facts and was inflammatory.

    Veteran actors Wei Heling and Zhao Huishen used their personal experiences to make a clear comparison between the situation of film workers in the old and new societies. Wei Heling said that he entered the drama world at the age of nineteen and is now over fifty years old. Before liberation, film companies often defaulted on wages, and most actors lived in poverty. After liberation, the Party and the government not only took over all the original staff of the old film companies, but also brought back old actors who had long been abandoned by capitalists in the film industry. People like Wang Hanlun and Fan Xuepeng are now taken care of by the Party. He said that the achievements of film work are inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Which of the four or fifty excellent films selected recently since the "May Fourth" Movement was not produced under the leadership and influence of the Party?

    Zhao Huishen spoke sadly at the meeting about two past events. In 1943, the progressive drama worker Shen Shuofu died of a heart attack on the streets of Chongqing. In 1945, the excellent director He Mengfu suffered from liver disease and died because the material conditions at the time were too poor and he did not receive the proper treatment. She herself and Situ Huimin even borrowed usurious loans in Chongqing to perform "Before and After Qingming." She said, please think about it, the comfortable lives we live today are simply unimaginable in the past. How has the Party treated us unfairly? The Party is too generous to us.

    Many people listed facts to refute the rightists' lies about denying the achievements of the Party's leadership in the film industry. Zheng Bozhang and others cited many facts to show that China's film has made great achievements in technology. The film industry that did not exist in old China has begun to be built in just eight years, and projection equipment has been produced in large quantities since 1953. Film developing machines and newsreel cameras can also be manufactured, and many technical problems that old China had never encountered are also being studied. He said that as long as you compare the films made at the beginning of liberation with the films made today, you can see that there has been great progress in sound, picture, and lighting. Many others explained in their speeches that the Party attaches great importance to cultivating new forces in the film industry, and the achievements in recent years have been great. Director Shi Lan said that most of the screenwriters, directors, and photographers of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio are emerging young people, who have been cultivated by the Party in recent years. Chen Huaikai and Li Keng said that they were young directors and young actors trained by the Party. Xie Tian said that under the cultivation of the Party, young actors are growing rapidly, and people like Zhao Lian have already achieved a certain artistic cultivation.

    More than 60 people attended the forum, including Situ Huimin, Chen Huangmei, Zhang Shuihua, Hai Mo, Jia Ji, Wu Benli, Li Enjie, Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Chen Ming, Li Jingbo, Ge Qin, and Lin Yi.

    The forum will continue.

### 中国电影工作者联谊会举行座谈会  粉碎右派分子对电影事业的进攻

    中国电影工作者联谊会举行座谈会
    粉碎右派分子对电影事业的进攻
    新华社14日讯　中国电影工作者联谊会于12、13日在北京召开两次座谈会，反击右派分子对党领导的人民电影事业的进攻。
    座谈会是联谊会主席蔡楚生召开的。他在讲话中揭发了右派分子向党的电影事业进攻的阴谋活动；指责了“文汇报”所发表的许多挑拨党和电影界人士关系的文章和消息。蔡楚生指出：解放前的进步电影即是在党的领导和影响下成长起来的。解放后，电影事业的迅速发展是有目共睹的事实。在1951年就彻底排除了盘据中国影坛几十年之久的帝国主义有毒的电影，而以我国自制的影片和译制的社会主义国家的影片来占领阵地。在党的文艺方针指导下，工农兵劳动人民已成为电影作品主要的表现对象和主要的观众。新闻纪录片和科学教育片也在大量生产。他说，这些巨大的成就是不容抹煞的，工作中所存在的某些缺点也正在大力改进，明天的人民电影事业也必然会获得更辉煌的成就。他要求到会的电影工作者，在这次斗争中从各个方面来揭露右派分子对人民电影事业进攻的阴谋，并驳斥他们荒谬的言论。
    会上，大家踊跃发言，一致对现已开始被揭发出来的右派分子陈仁炳在上海电影界点火的阴谋活动表示万分愤慨，并表示要大力支持上海电影工作者反右派的正义斗争。大家在发言中警告陈仁炳等右派分子，如果再不彻底交代，决不和他干休。演员魏鹤龄揭发他在上海参加陈仁炳召开的一次座谈会的情况，他说，陈仁炳操纵会场，挑拨党群关系，煽起演员对党的不满情绪。会刚开完，陈仁炳就动员我入盟，做他的工具，好在我长期受到党的教育，因而没有落入这个右派分子的圈套。还有许多人揭发了北京有些民盟和九三学社的右派分子企图在电影工作者中间点火，挑拨离间，以不正当手段拉人入盟、入社等事实。演员石联星等人指出，电影界内部居然也出现了吴茵这样的右派分子，这是全体电影工作者所不能容忍的。
    到会的许多电影工作者还在发言中指出在“文汇报”发起对电影的讨论后，电影界有些人受了极坏的影响，甚至把凡是赞成社会主义现实主义、工农兵方向的都认为是“教条主义”。他们要求“文汇报”编辑部作深刻的检查，向读者说明真相，挽回已经造成的恶劣影响。
    陈播、马守清、陈怀凯等人揭发了“文汇报”别有用心地发表了许多歪曲事实、损害人民电影事业的文章和新闻。“文汇报”在去年发起“为什么好的国产片这样少”的讨论时，就被右派分子所利用，对人民的电影事业恶劣地加以污蔑，说成一团糟，比解放前还不如。不久以前，“文汇报”对文化部电影事业管理局开始整风的报道，还歪曲事实而且带有煽动性。
    老演员魏鹤龄、赵慧深以他们的亲身经历，为电影工作者在新旧社会的处境作了鲜明对比。魏鹤龄说，他十九岁就进入戏剧界，现在已经五十多岁了。解放前电影公司常常欠薪不发，大多数演员生活贫困不堪。解放后党和政府不但把旧的电影公司的原班人马全部接收下来，而且把过去早被资本家抛在电影圈外的老演员找回来，像王汉伦、范雪朋等人现在都受到党的照顾。他说，电影工作的成就是和党的领导不可分的，新近挑选出来的“五四”以来的四、五十部优秀影片，哪一部不是在党的领导和影响下摄制的？
    赵慧深在会上沉痛地讲起两件往事。1943年，进步戏剧工作者沈硕甫因发心脏病死在重庆马路上；1945年，优秀的导演贺孟斧患了肝病，因当时物质条件太差，没有得到应有的救治而死。她本人和司徒慧敏在重庆为演出“清明前后”甚至去借高利贷。她说，请大家想一想，我们今天过的优裕生活根本是过去所不能想像的，党哪一点上亏待了我们。党对我们太优厚了。
    许多人列举事实驳斥了右派分子抹煞党领导电影事业的成就的谎言。郑伯璋等人举出许多事实说明我国电影在技术方面已经取得很大成就。旧中国所没有的电影工业已经在短短八年里开始建设起来了，1953年起就大量生产放映机。洗片机和新闻摄影机也能制造了，还有不少旧中国从未接触过的技术问题也在进行研究。他说，只要把解放初摄制的和今天摄制的影片拿来比一比，就可以看出无论在声音、画面、光线各方面都有很大进步。还有许多人在发言中说明了党对培养电影界新生力量的重视，几年来的成绩是很大的。导演石岚说，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的编剧、导演、摄影师，大部分是后起的青年，他们都是党在这几年里培养出来的。陈怀凯和黎铿说，他们就是党培养出来的青年导演、青年演员。谢添说，现在青年演员在党的培养下很快成长，像赵联他们都已经具有一定艺术修养。
    出席座谈会的有司徒慧敏、陈荒煤、张水华、海默、贾霁、吴本立、李恩杰、王人美、黎莉莉、陈明、李景波、葛琴、林艺等六十多人。
    座谈会还将继续举行。
