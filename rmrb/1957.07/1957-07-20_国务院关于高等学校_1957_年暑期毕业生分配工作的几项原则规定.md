The main points of the regulations:

I. Formulate plans in batches and issue them in batches to strive for earlier assignment; II. Appropriately supplement and strengthen the teaching staff of higher education institutions and the research strength of scientific research departments; III. Graduates assigned to higher education institutions, scientific and administrative departments should participate in a certain period of physical labor as much as possible; IV. Conscientiously grasp the needs of employing departments and the general situation of graduates, pay attention to soliciting opinions from schools, teachers, and graduates, and overcome subjectivism; V. Do a good job in ideological mobilization, persuade students to consciously obey the state's assignment, and appropriately take care of personal aspirations where possible; but it is necessary to resolutely correct the erroneous attitude of accommodating and tolerating; VI. For the very few elements who seriously oppose socialism and other bad elements discovered in this rectification movement, except for those with counter-revolutionary crimes, they should generally still be given a way out and opportunities for continued transformation.

Over the years, relevant government departments have attached great importance to the assignment of graduates from higher education institutions, and the work has been improved every year. However, there are also some shortcomings in the assignment work: (1) Although political conditions have generally been taken into account in the assignment work, political review of students in schools has often not been carried out seriously. (2) Because the plan for training cadres is not accurate enough, and it is also difficult to be completely accurate, there is a gap between the professional caliber of some graduates and the actual needs, making it impossible for the assignment work to achieve complete consistency between supply and demand and consistency between learning and application as much as possible. (3) The annual graduate assignment plan, due to the adoption of the method of issuing all at once, has a relatively short time, and all aspects are not prepared enough; in the specific deployment, soliciting opinions from employing departments, teachers, and graduates, and implementing the mass line are also insufficient. (4) When assigning work, there is an excessive phenomenon of accommodating a small number of graduates who fundamentally disregard the needs of socialist construction of the motherland, wrongly insist on personal demands, and even refuse to work and make unreasonable demands. These shortcomings have caused certain losses to the work and have had a bad influence on young students.

In order to learn from existing experiences and lessons and effectively improve the assignment of graduates, the following principles are now made for the assignment of graduates from higher education institutions in the summer of 1957:

(1) The deployment plan for this year's graduates should be carried out according to the principle of formulating plans in batches, issuing them in batches, and striving for earlier assignment. The State Economic Commission is responsible for drafting the graduate assignment plan, and the Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for formulating specific deployment plans based on the draft plan formulated by the State Economic Commission. A batch of draft deployment plans should be issued as soon as they are drafted. After receiving the draft deployment plan, schools and relevant departments should deliberate and mobilize according to the draft to prepare for deployment and dispatch. After the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education have formulated all the deployment plans for graduates of various majors, and reported to the State Council for approval, the Ministry of Higher Education will officially notify the schools and employing departments to start dispatching and accepting.

(2) According to the long-term needs of national construction and the current actual situation, supplementing and strengthening the teaching staff of higher education institutions and the research strength of scientific research departments is an urgent task, and appropriate attention should be paid to it when assigning graduates this year. Students assigned to higher education institutions as teaching assistants, graduate students, and to scientific research departments as graduate students and intern researchers should ensure the necessary political and professional quality.

(3) For graduates of colleges and universities assigned to work in higher education institutions, scientific research institutions, and administrative organs, all units should pay attention to sending them to factories, enterprises, or agricultural production to participate in a certain period of physical labor as much as possible to exercise them, and gradually fix this method and make it a system.

(4) In order to do a good job in the assignment of graduates, we should grasp the actual situation and implement the mass line. In determining the assignment plan and specific deployment and dispatch work, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Higher Education, and relevant departments should conscientiously grasp the needs of employing departments and the general situation of graduates of various majors, pay attention to soliciting opinions from schools, teachers, and graduates, and actively adopt reasonable and feasible opinions put forward by all parties, and overcome subjectivism in the work.

(5) In the specific deployment and dispatch work, we should do a good job in ideological mobilization, persuade students to consciously accept the work assigned by the state, and encourage them to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. For the personal aspirations and practical difficulties raised by students, appropriate consideration should be given where possible. If the actual conditions cannot be taken care of, the difficulties of the country should be clearly explained to them, and they should be persuaded to obey the state's assignment. Except for certain deficient and urgently needed majors in the country that must all obey the state's assignment, for a small number of students in other majors who disregard the needs of the country, unreasonably insist on personal demands, and refuse to obey the assignment, graduation certificates can be issued, and the school leaders should announce to them that the state will no longer be responsible for assigning their work, and they should find their own jobs; however, state organs, schools, enterprises, and institutions can only accept students assigned by the state, and shall not freely employ these students who find their own jobs.

    In the past, when assigning work, some departments and schools blindly accommodated such a small number of students, tolerating them to live in guest houses for a long time, not doing work, and often making unreasonable demands and spreading bad influence. This attitude of accommodation and tolerance is wrong and must be resolutely corrected.

(6) In this rectification movement, it was found that there were a very small number of students in the current graduating class of higher education institutions (including secondary technical schools and secondary vocational schools) whose thoughts and behaviors seriously opposed socialism and other bad elements. For such elements, the country should generally still give them a way out and opportunities for continued transformation. Among them, those who pass the exams should also be issued graduation diplomas; those who fail the exams should not repeat the grade, but only be issued completion certificates. For the current graduating class, all schools should make a political review conclusion based on their daily performance, especially based on the final performance of this rectification movement. In the future, a political review conclusion should be made for each graduating class. Among them, those whose thoughts and behaviors seriously oppose socialism and other bad elements, except for those who have committed counter-revolutionary crimes and illegal and disorderly acts and should be sentenced to labor reform or re-education through labor according to law, others should be given work assessment. The assessment period can be set separately for one year, two years, or three years; during the assessment period, they should be assigned to do auxiliary work, without titles, without formal grading and salary, but only given living allowances. Among them, those with serious errors should be retained at the school for assessment; others should be uniformly assigned by the state, and the employing departments should be responsible for the assessment. If they are unwilling or do not obey the state's assignment, they can find their own jobs, and the government organs in their areas should be responsible for the assessment.

The above principles and regulations should be implemented by the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education in conjunction with relevant departments to formulate specific plans.

The assignment of graduates from various types of secondary vocational schools in the summer of 1957 shall be planned and implemented by the competent business departments with reference to the above principles and regulations. July 17, 1957

    国务院关于高等学校1957年暑期毕业生分配工作的几项原则规定
    规定的要点：
    一、分批拟定计划、分批下达，争取早些分配；二、适当补充和加强高等学校的师资和科学研究部门的研究力量；三、分配在高等学校、科学和行政部门的毕业生，应使他们尽可能参加一定时期的体力劳动；四、切实掌握用人部门的需要和毕业生的一般情况，注意征求学校、教师和毕业生的意见，克服主观主义；五、作好思想动员工作，说服学生自觉地服从国家分配，在可能条件下适当照顾个人志愿；但必须坚决纠正迁就、容忍的错误态度；六、对这次整风中发现的少数严重反对社会主义的分子和其他坏分子，除有反革命罪行的以外，一般地仍应给以生活出路和继续改造的机会。
    历年来政府各有关部门对于高等学校毕业生的分配工作，曾经给予了很大的重视，工作上也每年有所改进。但是，分配工作中也存在着若干缺点：（1）在分配工作中，虽然一般地注意了政治条件，但是对在校学生常常没有认真地进行政治审查。（2）由于培养干部的计划不够准确，也很难完全准确，部分毕业生的专业口径和实际需要存在着距离，使分配工作没有尽量作到供需一致和学用一致。（3）每年毕业生的分配计划，由于采取了全部一次下达的办法，时间比较短促，各方面准备不够；具体调配中征求用人部门、教师和毕业生的意见，贯彻群众路线也不够。（4）在分配工作的时候，对于少数根本不顾祖国社会主义建设需要、错误地坚持个人要求、甚至拒绝工作、无理取闹的毕业生，存在着过分迁就的现象。这些缺点，使工作造成了一定的损失，并且在青年学生中产生了不良的影响。
    为了吸取已有的经验教训，切实改进毕业生分配工作，现在对高等学校1957年暑期毕业生的分配工作，作如下原则规定：
    （一）今年毕业生的调配计划，应该采取分批拟定计划，分批下达，并且争取能够早些分配的原则进行。国家经济委员会负责拟订毕业生分配计划草案，高等教育部负责根据经委所拟订的计划草案制订具体调配计划草案。调配计划草案拟好一批即下达一批。学校和有关部门接到调配计划草案以后，即应该按照草案进行酝酿动员，作好调配和派遣的准备工作，俟经委和高教部对各项专业毕业生的调配计划全部订出，并且报经本院核准后，再由高教部正式通知各学校和用人部门开始派遣和接受。
    （二）根据国家建设的长远需要和目前的实际状况，补充和加强高等学校的师资力量和科学研究部门的研究力量，是一项迫切的任务，今年分配毕业生的时候应该予以适当的重视。分配到高等学校作助教、研究生的和到科学研究部门作研究生、实习研究员的学生，应该保证必要的政治和业务的质量。
    （三）分配在高等学校、科学研究机构和行政机关工作的大专学校毕业生，各单位都应该注意使他们尽可能地先到工厂、企业或者农业生产中去参加一定时期的体力劳动，加以锻炼，并且把这种办法逐渐地固定起来，成为制度。
    （四）为了作好毕业生的分配工作，应该掌握实际情况，贯彻群众路线。在确定分配计划和具体的调配、派遣工作中，国家经济委员会、高等教育部和有关部门，应该切实掌握用人部门的需要和各项专业毕业生的一般情况，注意征求学校、教师和毕业生的意见，积极采纳各方面所提出的合理的而又能够作到的意见，克服工作中的主观主义。
    （五）在具体调配和派遣工作中，应该作好思想动员工作，说服学生自觉地接受国家所分配的工作，鼓励他们积极参加祖国的社会主义建设。对于学生所提出的个人志愿和实际困难，应该在可能条件下给以适当的照顾。实际条件不可能照顾的，应该把国家的困难向他们交代清楚，说服他们服从国家分配。除开国家某些缺门和急需的专业必须全部服从国家分配以外，对于其他专业学科中少数不顾国家需要、无理坚持个人要求、拒不服从分配的学生，可以发给毕业证书，由学校负责人向他们宣布，国家不再负责分配他们的工作，由他们自找职业；但是，国家机关、学校、企业和事业只能接受国家分配的学生，不得自由录用这些自找职业的学生。
    在过去分配工作的时候，有些部门和学校对这类少数学生一味迁就，容忍他们长期住招待所，不做工作，并且经常无理取闹，散布不良影响。这种迁就和容忍的态度是错误的，必须坚决加以纠正。
    （六）在这次整风运动中发现高等学校（包括中等技术学校、中等专业学校）本届毕业生中有极少数思想行为严重反对社会主义的分子和其他坏分子。对于这种分子，一般地国家仍应该给以生活的出路和继续改造的机会。他们之中，凡是考试及格的，同样发给毕业文凭；凡是考试不及格的，不要留级，只发给结业证书。对本届毕业生，各校都应该根据他们的日常表现，特别要根据这次整风运动最后的表现给他们作出政治审查结论。今后每届毕业生，都应该作出政治审查结论。其中思想行为严重反对社会主义的分子和其他坏分子，除了有反革命罪行和违法乱纪行为的应该依法判处劳动改造或者劳动教养以外，其他都应该给以工作考查。考查的期限可以分别定为一年、两年或者三年；考查期间，分配他们做辅助工作，不给名义，不正式评级评薪，只给以生活补助费。他们之中错误严重的，应该留校考查；其他则由国家统一分配，由用人部门负责考查。如果他们不愿意或者不服从国家分配，可以由他自找职业，由他们所在地区的政府机关负责考查。
    以上各项原则规定，应该由国家经济委员会、高等教育部会同有关部门，制订具体计划执行。
    关于各类中等专业学校1957年暑期毕业生的分配问题，由各主管业务部门参照上述原则规定，订出计划执行。  1957年7月17日
