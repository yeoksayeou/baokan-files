The Great Achievements of Water Conservancy Projects Cannot Be Erased
The Fallacies of Water Conservancy Engineer Wang Shouchang Go Bankrupt

(Our Dispatch) The employees of the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department's Survey and Design Institute have, in recent days, been posting wall posters, holding discussion groups, and convening employee meetings to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements and actions of Wang Shouchang, a rightist element and engineer at the institute.

Like other rightists, Wang Shouchang first completely dismissed the achievements of our country's socialist construction, saying that the Party cannot lead science and technology, and portrayed the rural collectivization as a complete mess. He said, "The main thing about Hebei Province's water conservancy construction is its shortcomings; the achievements are individual. The Party can only lead class struggle, not science and technology. Peasants don't have any money after joining the cooperatives. Last year, no one even made new clothes, so very few people support agricultural cooperatives." Wang Shouchang also slandered the state's legal system, saying that the government should not have arrested him in 1954, attempting to reverse the verdict on his past crimes.

These reactionary statements by Wang Shouchang aroused boundless indignation among all employees of the Survey and Design Institute. At an employee meeting of the entire institute, He Shuxun used materials from Wang Shouchang's hometown to refute the lie that peasants do not support cooperatives. Wang Shouchang's home is in Qianhuangyantuo Village, Yutian County, Hebei. The Tianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in this village is a large cooperative with 418 households. Last year, more than 200 cooperative members received over 4,200 yuan in cash dividends, and other households received grain. Even Wang Shouchang's reactionary rich peasant family received dividends after joining the cooperative. Now, the village has a sewing machine specifically for making clothes for people, and the masses make even more themselves.

Yang Weisheng and Hu Wenkun listed the enormous achievements of Hebei Province's water conservancy construction under the leadership of the Party since liberation, refuting Wang Shouchang's distortion that water conservancy work has no achievements. Yang Weisheng said that in recent years, Hebei Province has completed 170 million cubic meters of earthwork alone, with an investment of more than 300 million yuan (excluding the central government's direct investment in the Guanting Reservoir project), equivalent to eight times the total national water conservancy investment during the Kuomintang rule from 1941 to 1948. It has completed the construction of Guanting Reservoir and Douhe Reservoir, opened up the Duliu Reduction River and Qingdianwa and other flood diversion areas, ensuring the safety of the capital and the industrial city of Tianjin and the railway lines, and greatly reducing waterlogging disasters. Some of the technologies of these water conservancy projects have reached world-class levels.

Wang Shouchang deliberately pretended not to see the above facts because he has consistently adhered to the standpoint of the reactionary rich peasant family. As early as before liberation, Wang Shouchang was anti-Soviet and anti-Communist when he was studying at the Northwest Institute of Technology. After liberation, he hid his counter-revolutionary younger brother who was guilty of blood debts. In 1950, when Wang Shouchang was recuperating in the Harbin Hospital, he attempted to murder Soviet expert Feiyeduoduo, who was recovering in the same room with him. Now that the employees of the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department's Survey and Design Institute have recognized Wang Shouchang's reactionary face, they have all expressed: We will thoroughly settle accounts with Wang Shouchang's anti-Party and anti-socialist statements and actions, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory.

### 水利工程的伟大成就抹杀不了  水利工程师王寿昌的谬论破产

    水利工程的伟大成就抹杀不了
    水利工程师王寿昌的谬论破产
    本报讯　河北省水利厅勘测设计院的职工，连日来纷纷在墙报上、座谈会上和职工大会上揭露和批判该院右派分子、工程师王寿昌的反党、反社会主义的言行。
    同其他右派分子一样，王寿昌首先一笔抹杀我国的社会主义建设成绩，说党不能领导科学技术，把农村的合作化说成一团糟。他说：“河北省的水利建设缺点是主要的，成绩是个别的。党只能领导阶级斗争，不能领导科学技术。农民入社后都没有钱了，去年一年，连一个作新衣服的都没有，所以很少有人赞成办农业合作社。”王寿昌还诬蔑国家的法制，说政府在1954年不该逮捕他，企图对他过去的罪行翻案。
    王寿昌的这些反动言论，激起勘测设计院全体职工的无比愤慨。在全院职工大会上，何树勋用王寿昌家乡的材料，驳斥了农民不赞成合作社的谎言。王寿昌家在河北玉田县前黄岩坨村。这个村的田丰农业社是个四百一十八户的大社。去年，二百多户社员分现款四千二百多元，其他户都分的是粮食。连王寿昌的反动富农家庭，入社后也分了款。现在这村专有一台缝纫机经常给人们作衣服，群众自己作的更多。
    杨蔚生、胡文昆列举解放以来在党的领导下河北省水利建设的巨大成就，驳斥了王寿昌歪曲水利工作没有成绩的说法。杨蔚生说，几年来，河北省仅土方工程就作了一亿七千万公方，投资三亿多元（不包括中央直接投资的官厅水库工程），相当于1941年到1948年国民党统治时期全国水利总投资的八倍。完成了官厅水库、陡河水库的修建、开辟了独流减河和青甸洼等泄洪区，保证了首都和天津工业城市及铁路沿线的安全，大大减少了内涝灾害。这些水利工程的一些技术，达到了世界水平。
    以上这些事实，王寿昌故意装作没有看见，是因为他一贯坚持站在反动富农家庭的立场上。早在解放前，王寿昌在西北工学院上学时就反苏反共。解放后，他又窝藏他的负有血债的反革命弟弟。1950年，王寿昌在哈尔滨医院养病时期，又企图杀害同他同室养病的苏联专家费也多多夫。现在，河北省水利厅勘测设计院的职工认清了王寿昌的反动面目后，都纷纷表示：彻底清算王寿昌的反党、反社会主义的言行，不获全胜，决不收兵。
