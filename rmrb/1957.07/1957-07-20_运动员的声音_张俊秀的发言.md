    The Voice of an Athlete
    Zhang Junxiu's Speech
    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the work reports of all the leading comrades. Through these reports, I clearly see that under the wise leadership of the Party and the government, in the short eight years since liberation, the socialist transformation and socialist construction have achieved extremely great and brilliant achievements. The people's democratic dictatorship system has become increasingly consolidated, the people's living standards have continuously improved, and all ethnic groups in the country have achieved unprecedented unity. Internationally, China's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level. The people of the whole country love the Communist Party and the People's Government even more, are proud of the country's growing strength, and are even more confident in striding forward towards socialism!
    This is an ironclad fact, an indisputable fact.
    However, a small handful of bourgeois rightists, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Huang Shaohong, are closing their eyes, ignoring the facts, confusing black and white, and reversing right and wrong. They insist on saying absurdities such as "people's lives have not improved" and "the Party has no prestige among the masses," even denying the great and brilliant achievements made in the work of the past few years, in order to achieve their goal of attacking the Party and socialism. Rightists! Stop daydreaming! The people of the whole country have long seen through all your conspiracies and tricks; your efforts are in vain.
    Rightists! You hate the Communist Party and resent socialism because you want to take the old capitalist road. We are the opposite of you; we love our Party, love our socialist motherland, and everything we do today is for the construction of socialism.
    Rightists! Please be clear about your situation! There are two paths before you: one is to stubbornly cling to your reactionary stance to the end, a path that is cut off from the people and leads to certain death; the other is to pull back from the brink, be honest, bow your heads to the people and confess your crimes, and take the socialist road to serve the people. This is the bright road. The door of socialism is open to you; please choose calmly! We welcome you to take the bright road of socialism and advance together with the people.
    Fellow representatives, I am an athlete, and I represent the athletes in saying a few words to you about the level of sports in our country:
    We are all very clear that the level of various sports in our country is still very young. Old China did not leave us a good legacy. The achievements we have today have been made in the eight years since liberation under the loving care and correct leadership of the Party and the government. Of course, they are also inseparable from the long-term hard work and diligent study of athletes, and their humble learning from the experiences of the Soviet Union, democratic countries, and domestic veteran athletes. We know that the people of old China were always slandered by foreigners as the "sick men of East Asia." Because the people of old China lived in poverty and had a very low standard of living, the vast majority of people simply did not have the opportunity to participate in sports. The sports of old China were only occupied by a small number of bourgeois children. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, there had never been a "world record" in international sports competitions. However, under the care and leadership of the Party and the government in New China, in just a few years, a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged, such as world record creators Chen Jingkai, Mu Xiangxiong, Shi Baozhu, and Qi Lieyun, who have won honor for the motherland. There are also Jiang Yongning, Wang Chuanyao, Cai Yishu, Zhang Honggen, and others who have added glory to the motherland, as well as a large number of other outstanding athletes emerging. Everyone is actively preparing to break the "egg" (i.e., zero points) record of the past in the next Olympic Games.
    Although our sports technical level has advanced by leaps and bounds and achieved great results, we must admit that the sports technical level of many of our projects is still very low and has not reached the world level. However, our athletes are unwavering in their confidence and will catch up with the international level within no more than ten years to win glory for our great motherland.
    Finally, I hope that all athletes will actively take action in this anti-rightist struggle, raise their awareness, draw a clear line with the rightists, expose the rightists in the sports ranks, and fight these rightists to the end.

    运动员的声音
    张俊秀的发言
    我完全同意并衷心地拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的各项工作报告，通过这些报告，使我清楚地看到，在党和政府的英明领导下，仅仅在解放后短短的八年中间，社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业取得了极其巨大、辉煌的成就，人民民主专政制度愈益巩固，人民生活不断地得到改善，全国各族人民达到了空前的大团结。在国际上，我国的国际地位空前提高，全国人民更加热爱共产党和人民政府，都为祖国的日益强大感到自豪，更加信心百倍地向社会主义大跨步地迈进！
    这是铁一般的事实，是无可争辩的事实。
    可是有一小撮的资产阶级右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑等人，都在闭着眼睛，不看事实，混淆黑白，颠倒是非，他们偏偏说：“人民生活没有得到改善”、“党在群众中没有威信”等等谬论，甚至否定几年来工作中所获得的巨大、辉煌的成就，以达到他们向党向社会主义进攻的目的。右派分子们！你们别在做白昼梦吧！你们的一切阴谋诡计全国人民早就识破了的，你们的心机是白费的。
    右派分子们！你们仇恨共产党，憎恨社会主义，为的是要走资本主义的老路。我们和你们恰恰相反，我们热爱我的党，热爱社会主义祖国，我们今天的一切都是为了建设社会主义。
    右派分子们！请你们自己清楚一点吧！摆在你们面前有两条道路：一条是坚持反动立场顽固到底，这一条路是自绝于人民的，死路一条；另一条是悬崖勒马，老老实实，向人民低头认罪，走社会主义道路，为人民服务，这才是光明大道。社会主义的大门向你们是开着的，请你们冷静地选择吧！我们欢迎你们走社会主义光明大道，和人民一齐前进。
    各位代表，我是一个运动员，我代表运动员向各位代表讲几句话，谈谈我国运动的水平问题：
    我们大家都很清楚，我国的各项运动水平都很年青，旧中国没有给我们留下很好的遗产，今天我们现有的成绩都是在解放后八年来由于党和政府亲切关怀和正确领导之下取得的，当然也是和运动员长期勤学苦练、虚心学习苏联和民主国家及国内老前辈的经验分不开的。我们知道，旧中国人民一向是被外人污蔑为“东亚病夫”，由于旧中国人民生活贫困，生活水平很低，广大人民根本就得不到体育锻炼的机会，旧中国的体育运动只是为少数的资产阶级子弟所占有。在过去国民党统治时期，在国际体育竞赛上从来就没有过“世界纪录”，可是新中国在党和政府关怀领导之下，在短短的几年中，我国就出现了大批优秀的运动员，如世界纪录创造者陈镜开、穆祥雄、石宝珠、戚烈云等人，为祖国争得了荣誉，还有我们熟悉的姜永宁、王传耀、蔡艺墅、张宏根等也给祖国增添光彩，另外还有大批的优秀运动员涌现出来。大家都积极地准备着在下届奥林匹克运动会中打破过去“光蛋”（即零分）的纪录。
    我们的运动技术水平虽然是突飞猛进，取得了很大的成绩，可是我们应承认，我国的运动技术水平有很多项目仍然是很低的，没有达到世界水平，但我国运动员都坚定不移地信心百倍地在不过十年之内要赶上国际水平，为我们伟大的祖国争光。
    最后，我希望全体运动员在这次反右派斗争中，积极地行动起来，提高认识，和右派分子划清界限，揭露在体育行列中的右派分子，并与这些右派分子斗争到底。
