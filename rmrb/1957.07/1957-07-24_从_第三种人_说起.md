    Starting with the "Third Kind of People"
    Tong Heng
    The ugly true face of the old-brand "Third Kind of Person," Shi Zhecun, has been completely exposed this time.
    The so-called "Third Kind of People" were originally a few degenerate elements who mingled in literary circles more than twenty years ago. They claimed to be a third party "transcending" the enemy and ourselves, pretending to be "impartial," but in reality, they completely obeyed the enemy's command and launched insidious attacks on the Party, the League of Left-Wing Writers led by the Party, and the progressive writers around it. At that time, the sharp-eyed Mr. Lu Xun had already seen through their trick. He said:
    "The so-called 'Third Kind of People' originally just means: people who stand outside the opposition or struggle between A and B. But in reality, it is impossible to exist. The human body has fat and thin, and in theory, there should be a third kind of person who is neither fat nor thin, but in fact, there is not. Once compared, one is either close to fat or close to thin. The same is true for the 'Third Kind of People' in literature and art. Even if they seem impartial, they are actually somewhat biased. They usually intentionally or unintentionally cover it up, but when they encounter a crucial incident, it will be clearly revealed." ["More on the 'Third Kind of People'" (1933)]
    Isn't that so? For more than twenty years, the "Third Kind of People" like Shi Zhecun, no matter how they usually concealed themselves, clearly revealed themselves one by one when they encountered crucial incidents (such as the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation) (for example, some became traitors, and some became secret agents). And this time, Shi Zhecun and some other new-brand "Third Kind of People" actually regarded the rectification movement as another opportunity to take advantage of and frantically launched a large-scale attack on the Party. In this way, their true colors, which they had tried their best to conceal, even for many years, were finally revealed even more clearly.
    Mr. Lu Xun's words have new significance for intellectuals facing this crucial juncture of the anti-Rightist struggle, whether it is to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves or to test themselves. Whether each intellectual is left, right, leaning towards left or right, or an old-brand or new-brand "Third Kind of Person," will be clearly revealed in the actual struggle.

### 从“第三种人”说起

    从“第三种人”说起
    同衡
    老牌“第三种人”施蛰存的丑恶的真面目，这一次是彻底败露了。
    所谓“第三种人”，本是二十多年前混迹于文艺界的几名堕落分子。他们以“超然”于敌我两方之外的第三方自居，伪装一副“不偏不倚”的态度，而实际上则完全听命于敌人的指挥刀，向党、向党领导的左翼作家联盟及其周围的进步作家，暗地里阴毒地进攻。当时，目光敏锐的鲁迅先生早就看穿他们这套把戏了。他说：
    “所谓‘第三种人’，原意只是说：站在甲乙对立或相斗之外的人。但在实际上，是不能有的。人体有胖和瘦，在理论上，是该能有不胖不瘦的第三种人的，然而事实上却并没有，一加比较，非近于胖，就近于瘦。文艺上的‘第三种人’也一样，即使好像不偏不倚罢，其实是总有些偏向的，平时有意或无意的遮掩起来，而一遇切要的事故，他便会分明的显现。”〔“又论‘第三种人’”（1933）〕
    可不是吗？二十多年来，施蛰存之流的“第三种人”，尽管平时如何遮掩，一遇切要的事故（例如抗日战争和解放战争），便一一分明的显现了（例如有的当了汉奸，有的当了特务）。而这一次的施蛰存以及另一些新牌的“第三种人”，竟把整风运动认为又是什么可乘之机，便疯狂地向党大肆进攻。这样他们平时竭力遮掩甚至遮掩了多年的原形，也便终于更其分明的显现了。
    鲁迅先生的话，对于当前面临反右派斗争这一切要关头的知识分子来说，无论是鉴别敌我、考验自己，都有着新的意义。每一个知识分子，究竟是左、是右、是近于左或近于右、还是老牌或新牌的“第三种人”，都将在实际斗争中分明地显现出来。
