Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th — One hundred thousand British bus workers employed by private companies began a nationwide strike at midnight this morning, demanding higher wages. This is the largest such strike since 1926. The strike has halted all long-distance bus transportation, with approximately 28,000 buses and coaches out of service. Only inner-city bus transportation in London and other cities has been unaffected.

The bus workers' union is demanding a wage increase of about one pound per week to reduce the wage gap between London and other areas. However, the employers have only agreed to an increase of three shillings. The Minister of Labour has decided to submit the matter to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal for arbitration.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th — TASS, Paris, 18th: The strike movement in France, triggered by continuously rising prices, has recently reached a massive scale. Currently, bank employees, gas and electricity industry workers, and others are striking to demand improved material conditions.

Because the Ministry of Finance and Economy refused to approve wage increases for bank employees, bank managers have also joined the strike. In many regions throughout France, almost all bank employees have participated in the strike, totaling 80,000 people. At a mass rally held in Paris yesterday, the strikers unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the "struggle be carried on to final victory."

Workers in the French gas and electricity industry held a short-term strike demanding higher wages.

    英十万汽车工人罢工
    法国罢工运动继续高涨
    据新华社伦敦20日电　英国私营公司雇用的十万公共汽车工人在今晨零时开始了要求增加工资的全国性罢工。这是自1926年以来这种罢工中最大的一次。这次罢工使所有的长途汽车交通停顿，二万八千辆左右的公共汽车和客车停驶。只有伦敦和各城市的市内公共汽车交通没有受到影响。
    公共汽车工人工会要求每星期增加一镑左右的工资，以缩小伦敦和外地的工资率的差异。但是，老板只同意增加三先令。劳工大臣决定把此事提交工业纠纷法庭仲裁。
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎18日讯：法国因为物价不断高涨而引起的罢工运动最近达到规模巨大。现在正在罢工要求改善物质状况的有银行职员、煤气和电气工业的职工等。
    由于财政经济部拒绝批准提高银行职员的工资，银行的领导人员也加入了罢工。在法国全国许多地区几乎全体银行职工都参加了罢工。参加罢工的银行职员共有八万人。昨天在巴黎举行的群众大会上，罢工者一致通过决议，要求“把斗争进行到最后胜利”。
    法国煤气和电气工业的工人举行了短期罢工，要求提高工资。
