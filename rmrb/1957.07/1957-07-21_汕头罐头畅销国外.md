(Southern Daily News) This year, the local state-owned Shantou Cannery exported 3,529 tons of canned fruits and meats in the first half of the year, an increase of 1.6 times compared to the same period last year. Some British, West German, and Singaporean firms consider the canned goods exported this year to be of high quality and good taste.

This factory produces a total of 73 kinds of canned goods, among which Chaozhou mandarin oranges, pineapples, lychees, longans, and pickled mustard tuber are particularly characteristic of the region. In the first half of this year, the products were not only selling well in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries but also exported to the United Kingdom, Singapore, Indonesia, and other places, with some sold to Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, Belgium, West Germany, France, Syria, Japan, Egypt, Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, New Zealand, and other countries.
