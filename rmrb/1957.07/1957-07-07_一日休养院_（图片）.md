    "One-Day Sanatorium"
    The Dalian Workers' Seaside Sanatorium has begun receiving its new guests for the year. This sanatorium is a collective welfare undertaking established last year by the Dalian Trade Union organization using labor insurance funds. It is specifically designed to restore the fatigue of employees and enjoy the seaside scenery, and is therefore also known as the "One-Day Sanatorium." This year, the sanatorium is expected to receive more than 20,000 employees. The picture shows guests of the "One-Day Sanatorium" eating and playing games under colorful parasols.

    “一日休养院”
    旅大市工人海滨休养院已经开始接待今年的新客人。这个休养院是旅大市工会组织在去年以劳保基金创办的集体福利事业。它是专为恢复职工的疲劳和饱览海滨风光而设立的，因此又称为“一日休养院”。今年休养院预计将接待职工两万多人。图为“一日休养院”的客人们，正在彩色的遮阳伞下用饭和游戏。
