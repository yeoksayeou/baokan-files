    Twilight on the Danube
    --Visit to Dorna County, Hungary, Part 4
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
  　We strolled along the riverbank, a blood-red setting sun hanging like a lantern on the treetops of the deer forest. The end of the green forest was dotted with blooming pear and peach trees. The afterglow of the setting sun added a layer of pink to it, making it particularly charming.
    In an instant, the sky was woven with brocade-like sunset clouds, which reflected on the quiet, mirror-like river surface. From the backyard of the hunting lodge, a burst of fire and green smoke rose as a pair of young hunters busied themselves preparing dinner for us unexpected guests. A camping aluminum pot hung on a wooden frame, in which the famous Danube fish soup was being cooked.
    At this time, the water, sky, forest, garden, and thatched cottage were all dissolved by the light and color of the sunset, forming a very harmonious picture.
    A small motorboat and a small rowboat belonging to the hunting lodge were parked on the shore. We sat silently on the bow of the boat, intoxicated by the beauty bestowed by nature. Except for the occasional sound of small fish jumping out of the water, everything seemed to be still. The Danube River is sometimes like a sleeping maiden, sometimes like a gorgeously dressed girl returning from a ball, and sometimes like a pensive poet. The long journey it has traveled is like the twists and turns of a person's life.
    The Danube River crawls out of the dark forests of Germany, winding and twisting, learning to walk like an infant. By the time it reaches Vienna, it is like a seven or eight-year-old child, jumping and frolicking, naughty and mischievous. When it arrives in Hungary, it has become a handsome young man, sometimes calm, sometimes active. From Visegrád (north of Budapest) southward, it becomes more mature and stronger, which is precisely the stage of its energetic and creative abundance. Flowing to the southern border of Hungary, starting from the Mohács area, it encounters difficulties, with many reefs and rapid currents, and it keeps struggling. After the storms in Yugoslavia, it comes to Romania, at which point it is like an old man who has created a rich career but also feels the fatigue after a long journey, and then finds its final resting place in the Black Sea.
    The Danube River is the most loyal friend to the Hungarian people. Although it is like a passing guest, it is so selfless and generous to the Hungarian people, bringing them light and happiness. It flows from west to east, and from north to south, and wherever it goes, there are idyllic landscapes, fertile lands, and areas teeming with factories.
    Last year was a difficult year for Hungary. Earthquakes, floods, and counter-revolutionary riots occurred. Even a kind river like the Danube was hit by flash floods. In February of last year, when the ice on the river had not yet melted, the flash floods rushed down, overwhelming the Danube, and it flooded into a disaster.
    This deer forest was the first to suffer. Surrounded by two rivers, the floodwaters submerged the rooftops. Of the original 2,500 deer in the forest, more than 2,000 were drowned in the flood, and many other animals were also lost. Originally, deer were good swimmers, but because the river water was frozen, many deer were frozen to death in the ice floes. Two years ago, the Hungarian film company had produced an extremely beautiful and vivid color film depicting the rich life of the animal kingdom in the Gemenec Forest. Looking at the scene in the forest today, it seems particularly desolate. Last year, Bagić was so distressed by the tragedy of this deer forest that he suffered a nervous breakdown, but now he is full of confidence again. More than 500 deer have been preserved in the forest. These deer have survived life-and-death struggles and are the strongest and best breeding stock. This year, more than 250 fawns will be born, and it is estimated that after six or seven years of breeding, the scale before the flood can be restored.
    In addition to the deer forest, many gardens and villages were submerged and destroyed by last year's floods. One piece of land was washed into a small lake. More than 80 households in one village were destroyed. At that time, the residents repaired the dikes for ten days and nights without rest, and some workers fainted on the ground due to overwork. This was a flood that had not occurred in more than seventy years. Due to a lack of experience in fighting the flood, the losses were therefore great. But now, in less than a year, the government has provided loans to help build hundreds of new-style single-family cottages to help these disaster victims. On our way to Deji Village, we saw a patch of red-roofed tile houses, which were the new villages built after the flood. If it had been the Horthy era, what would have been the fate of these disaster victims? It would have issued nothing but a permit for the victims to wander around and beg, and would not have done anything else good. If it received donations from foreign charitable organizations, it would still have made a profit from the disaster victims. These new houses appearing on this flat ground are nothing but a myth to the disaster victims of old Hungary.
    After a moment of silence, Comrade Samosh could not help but exclaim, "Look, how beautiful are the rivers and mountains of our motherland! When I encounter烦恼 things in Budapest, I think of my lovely hometown, and I give myself strength. It is sad that those writers who claim to be of the people, like Gyula Háy and Tamás Aczél, have never seen Hungary, let alone understand the thoughts and feelings of the Hungarian people, apart from their own villas and cars. I really can't imagine that a person can easily abandon his motherland for dollars!"
    The young driver István also thought of the fate of those Hungarian youths who fled to the West and became slaves to the capitalists. "They learned a lesson in patriotism when they arrived in the West. Now many people are writing letters to their relatives and friends expressing their regret that it is too late." He then added: "Don't even ask me to leave Hungary, I won't even leave Dorna County." "I have been driving here for several years, and I am familiar with every piece of land and every household in the whole county. Last year, the leadership wanted me to go to party school to study and wanted me to do youth work. I said, I welcome the opportunity to study, but I won't change my career. In order to protect my profession, I almost made the mistake of not observing discipline." István is a twenty-six-year-old companion. After two days of traveling together, I deeply felt that he was not only a vigilant and skilled driver, but also a very good companion. As his old car bumped along the rugged path, he held the steering wheel in one hand and gestured with the other, talking to us about many interesting and serious issues, making us forget the distance of the journey and the unevenness of the road. It was on this trip that I met the real Hungarian youth. (Attached photo)

    多瑙河的黄昏
    ——匈牙利多尔娜州访问记之四
    本报记者　胡济邦
  　我们在河边漫步，一轮血红的夕阳好像灯笼似的挂在鹿林的树梢上。绿林尽头点缀着几棵盛开的梨花和桃树。夕阳的余辉又给它添染上一层粉色，显得分外娇妍。
    转瞬间，天空中织出了五采锦缎般的晚霞，它映照着安静如镜的河面，猎站的后院，冒出一团火光和青烟，一对青年猎人正忙着为我们这些不速之客准备晚餐。木架上挂一只露营用的铝锅，里面煮着有名的多瑙河的鱼汤。
    这时水天、林园和草舍，全都为晚霞的光色所溶化了，这就构成了一幅十分协调的画面。
    岸边停着猎站的一个小摩托船和一只小划子，我们静默地坐在船头上，为大自然所赋予的美景陶醉了。除了偶尔听见小鱼跳跃的水声外，似乎一切都在静止中。多瑙河有时像一位甜睡中的少女，有时像一位从舞会归来的盛装的姑娘，有时又像一位沉思的诗人，它所经过的漫长路途，也像人的一生曲折多变。
    多瑙河从德国的黑暗的森林中爬出，弯弯曲曲，似婴儿一般学着走路。到了维也纳就像七、八岁的孩子蹦蹦跳跳顽皮多端。来到匈牙利已变成一位英俊的青年，有时沉静，有时活跃。从维什格拉（布达佩斯以北）向南下时，它更加成熟而壮大了，这正是它精力充沛，创造力丰富的阶段。流到匈南边境，从莫哈齐一带开始，遇到困难了，礁石多，水流湍急，它一直在挣扎。经过了南斯拉夫境内的风暴之后，来到罗马尼亚境，这时就像一位老年人，他已创造了丰富的事业，但也感得长途奔波后的疲劳，于是就在黑海找到了自己的归宿。
    多瑙河对于匈牙利人民是一个最忠实的朋友，它虽然是像过路的客人，但它对于匈牙利人民是那么无私而慷慨，它给匈牙利人民带来了光明和幸福。它从西流到东，又从北流到南，在它所到之地都是田园、沃土、工厂林立的地区。
    去年是匈牙利多难的一年，地震、水灾和反革命的暴乱，像多瑙河这样善良的河流也受到山洪的袭击。去年2月，当河上的冰块尚未溶化时，山洪冲击而下，使多瑙河一时承受不住，于是泛滥成灾。
    这个鹿林首先遭难。它在两条河流的包围中，大水淹没屋顶，林内原有二千五百多头鹿，在这次大水中被淹死了二千多头，其他动物也损失很多。原来鹿是善于游泳的，但由于河水的冰冻，许多鹿都被冻死在冰块中了。两年前，匈牙利影片公司曾在盖门次森林中摄制了一部描写动物界丰富生活的极其美丽生动的五彩片。再看今天森林中的景象，特别显得凄凉。巴吉奇去年为了这个鹿林的悲剧而痛苦得神经失常，现在他又充满了信心。森林中还保留下五百多只鹿，这些鹿是经过生死斗争，也是生命力最强的一部分优良母种。今年就要生出二百五十多只小鹿，估计经过六、七年的繁殖，就可恢复水灾前的规模。
    去年水灾除了鹿林之外，许多田园村舍都被淹没和冲毁了。有一块地被冲成一个小湖。一个村舍有八十多户人家都塌毁了。当时居民抢修堤坝有十昼夜未得到休息，有的工人因疲劳过度晕倒在地上。这是七十多年来没有过的水灾。由于缺乏与水斗争的经验，因此遭受损失甚大。但现在不到一年时间，政府为救济这些灾民，已贷款帮助建造了几百所新式的独院、小屋。在我们到德吉村的途中，看到一片红顶瓦房，这就是在水灾后兴建起来的新村。假如在霍尔蒂时代，这些灾民的命运将会怎样呢？它除了给灾民们签发一张流浪他乡去作乞丐的许可证外，不会作出其他好事来。如果得到外国慈善机关救济款项的话，他们还能在灾民身上捞到一笔钱。现在这块平地上出现的这些新式房舍，对于旧日匈牙利的灾民来说只能是一个神话。
    沙莫什同志在沉默片刻之后，禁不住赞叹说，你看，我们祖国的河山是多么美丽呀！当我在布达佩斯遇到烦恼的事情时，我一想到我这可爱的家乡，就给自己增加了一种力量。可悲的是我们那些自命为人民的作家，像久拉·海伊和塔马什·阿采尔之流，除了自己的别墅和汽车之外，他们并没有看见过匈牙利，更不了解匈牙利人的思想和感情。我真不能设想一个人为了美元可以轻易地抛弃祖国！
    青年司机伊士特万也想起那些流亡西方变成资本家的奴仆的匈牙利青年的命运。“他们到了西方才上了爱国主义的一课。现在许多人都写信给自己的亲友们表示悔之已晚的感伤。”他又接着说：“别说要我离开匈牙利，就要我离开多尔娜州也不行。”“我在这里已开了几年汽车，全州每块土地，每户人家我都熟悉。去年上级要我进党校学习，并要我去做青年工作，我说，要我学习我欢迎，但要我改行就不行。为了爱护自己的职业，我差一点犯了不遵守纪律的错误。”伊士特万是一个二十六岁的伴侣，经过两天来我们一起旅行，我深深地感到，他不仅是一个机警熟练的司机，同时也是一个很好的侣伴。当他这辆破旧的小汽车在崎岖的小路上颠簸前进时，他一只手把握着轮盘，另一只手做出各种姿势和我们谈论着许多有趣而严肃的问题，使我们忘记了路途的远近和道路的不平。我在这次旅行中才认识了真正的匈牙利青年。（附图片）
    夕阳的余辉照着蓝色的多瑙河，牛群还在静静地啮着青草。
