I fully agree with the reports of the State Council, the Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

    **Establishing a Communist Worldview Is Especially Necessary Now**

Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report have once again brightened our eyes, enabling us to better distinguish between right and wrong and recognize the way forward. As a member of the iron and steel industry, I participated in the work mentioned in the speech, where national steel production increased from tens of thousands of tons to over four million tons in just seven years. I understand the particularly significant meaning of the increase in steel production for our still poor and backward country, and I also deeply appreciate the tremendous achievements we have attained under the leadership of the Party by overcoming many arduous difficulties in management, technology, materials, and ideology. I firmly believe that only the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party can enable us to achieve the existing achievements and complete the more arduous tasks in the future. Therefore, the absurd remarks made by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Ge Peiqi, etc., in the previous period, which slandered the Party, attempted to overthrow the Party's leadership, and retreat to capitalism, are intolerable, and I firmly oppose them.

    The anti-Rightist struggle in society this time has been of great educational significance to me. Recalling when I first saw these fallacies in the newspaper, although I felt angry because they were too one-sided, too exaggerated, and too inconsistent with the facts, I did not fully realize its anti-Party and anti-socialist dangerous nature at that time. This shows that although I have studied some Marxism-Leninism in recent years, my political sensitivity is still very dull. This is a wake-up call, making me realize that strengthening political study, continuing to transform myself, and establishing a proletarian and communist worldview are not only still necessary but also even more necessary now. I will keep in mind Chairman Mao's six criteria for distinguishing between right and wrong and use them as a criterion for measuring my own and others' words and deeds.

    **Some Leading Cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel Lack a Down-to-Earth Working Style**

I would also like to offer some opinions on the problems of the iron and steel industry. The Party and the government often call for increased production and thrift, and for building the country diligently and thriftily. In recent years, our employees of Anshan Iron and Steel have responded to the call of the Central Committee and have made achievements in this regard. For example, last year's pig iron production increased by 35% compared with the previous year, steel ingot increased by 87%, and steel increased by 74%, completing the Five-Year Plan in four years. But upon inspection, there are still many wasteful elements. In the past, several factories we expanded adopted what could be said to be the highest international standards, some of which now seem to be very economical. To give just a few examples, some factory buildings adopted mechanical opening and closing window devices, some non-production buildings were too elaborate, and some mechanized and automated production devices were not necessary at present and could be added later; in some reconstruction projects, the original production equipment was not considered for full utilization, and there was too much demolition and reconstruction, etc. All of these have increased our capital construction investment and delayed the time to put into production, which is not in line with the spirit of increasing production and thrift. At present, the design unit is modifying the design of the units that have not yet been completed in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. I think this is very necessary, and I believe that a lot of money can be saved.

    In terms of production, Anshan Iron and Steel also has many shortcomings. We still have a lot of losses in output and quality due to equipment accidents, the poor implementation of technical regulations and systems, and low technical level. Some steel products with high-quality requirements have not been able to fully supply users. At present, some quota indicators are still behind those of advanced enterprises in the Soviet Union.

    In order to better achieve increased production and thrift, I think we need to improve enterprise management. Mainly due to the needs of preparing for brother enterprises and the development of our enterprise, the current organization of Anshan Iron and Steel is relatively large, with many people and many leading cadres at all levels. I think if we can have a good division of labor and cooperation, it would not be bad to have more people. However, at present, some of our leading cadres (Party members and non-Party members, administrative and technical cadres) lack a down-to-earth working style, and sometimes tend to rely solely on calling and arranging leadership instead of going deep into the masses, working with everyone, and using specific guidance and their own examples to lead. In this way, it is not easy to do the work well, and at the same time, it is impossible to improve the working level of the masses and leaders themselves. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish a more down-to-earth working style, starting from the leadership. The Party's rectification will undoubtedly make the working style of Party members even better; I think non-Party cadres also need, and even more need, to rectify their own problems and improve their ideological style. Of course, there are many contents to improve enterprise management, but I think what is discussed here is a more fundamental point.

    Chairman Mao pointed out that China's steel production may develop to 20 million tons or more in the three Five-Year Plans or more time. We were really excited to hear this and will work hard to over fulfill this goal. In the road of rapid development of the iron and steel industry, it is necessary to correctly solve many major problems; I would like to talk about the coordinated construction of large, medium, and small iron and steel enterprises.

    **In order to solve the needs of the present and for a period of time to come, it is reasonable to establish a number of small enterprises in places where conditions permit.**

China has a vast territory and relatively poor transportation conditions. Therefore, it is reasonable to establish small mines, small iron-smelting plants, small coke-smelting plants, and even small steel-smelting and rolling mills in locations where conditions permit to help solve the local urgent need for metals. Such enterprises can adopt simple equipment or even handicraft equipment, basically rely on local forces for construction, and do not need to occupy much of the national design, equipment manufacturing, and construction units; and because of the wide coverage, they can start producing a considerable total amount of iron and steel in a relatively short period of time. The disadvantage of this kind of factory is that it generally cannot use low-grade ores, many by-products cannot be recovered, and raw materials and labor consumption are large. Therefore, in general, the consumption of resources is relatively wasteful. But as mentioned above, in order to solve the current and future needs for a period of time, it is reasonable to establish a number of such small enterprises.

    **Building large factories is a common trend in all countries in the world, and the economic benefits of large factories far exceed those of small factories.**

As for permanent, more or less modernized iron and steel enterprises, the construction scale of each enterprise must be carefully compared and studied based on specific conditions for current and long-term benefits before it can be correctly determined. But as a general principle, my idea is that for iron and steel enterprises that produce a large amount of ordinary steel that is needed (this type of product of course accounts for the vast majority of all steel production), enterprises with larger scale should be established as much as possible based on the conditions (mainly the size of resources), and medium and small enterprises should be established in places where resource conditions are not sufficient to build large factories. The following points are put forward as a reference for considering the scale of factory construction.

    1. Generally speaking, the capital construction investment per ton of production capacity is lower for large factories than for small factories (not counting small factories with very simple equipment that are almost handicraft). For example, according to the data of existing steel plants in the Soviet Union, some people in the Soviet Union have obtained the following relationship:

    For a factory with an annual output of 1.625 million tons of steel ingots, the capital construction investment per ton of steel ingot production capacity is 100%. Then, for a factory with an annual output of 2.3 million tons, the investment only needs 89.3%, and for a factory with an annual output of 5.4 million tons, the investment only needs 81.9%.

    China has built fewer steel plants and does not have systematic comparison data. However, the Metallurgical Industry News published by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently said in an editorial that the investment required to build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons can be used to build nine medium and small steel plants with an annual output of 160,000 tons. The total production capacity is the same, and the investment can also save more than 150 million yuan. This is different from the situation listed above. It is understood that the actual example on which the editorial is based is not very suitable for comparison. But even if there is indeed a reverse difference of more than 150 million yuan, due to the too high design standards of our large factories in the past (the situation of Anshan Iron and Steel has been discussed above), if we pay attention to saving and fully utilize domestic equipment, it is estimated that it is very possible for large factories to reduce such an amount of investment. It is recommended that the government instruct relevant departments to make an estimate of the investment required for unit production capacity in China to build steel plants of different sizes, for reference in future factory construction planning.

    2. The product cost of large factories is low, and the labor productivity is high. Taking the actual figures of 1956 as an example, the cost of pig iron in Shijingshan, Ma'anshan, Chongqing and other factories is 1.14 to 1.82 times that of Anshan Iron and Steel; the cost of steel ingots in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shanghai, and Chongqing is 1.9 to 2.5 times that of Anshan Iron and Steel; the cost of small steel products in Tianjin, Tangshan, Shanghai, and Chongqing is 1.9 to 2.8 times that of Anshan Iron and Steel.

   (These figures include the impact of certain differences between raw material allocation prices and costs, but this impact is not a large proportion.) In terms of labor productivity, the amount of iron produced by each iron-smelting worker in Anshan Iron and Steel is 5 to 23 times that of the above-mentioned factories, and the amount of steel produced by each steel-smelting worker is 4 to 6 times. It is worth pointing out that these huge differences are not due to the fact that other factories are doing worse work than Anshan Iron and Steel. On the contrary, these factories have many places where they do better than Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of enterprise management or technical operation. Their high costs and low labor productivity are mainly due to the small scale and some other unfavorable conditions that always exist in small factories. It is not difficult to imagine that such a huge difference in cost and labor productivity between large and small enterprises has a great impact on the long-term interests of the country. This is especially important to consider because an iron and steel plant will work for a long time after it is built.

    3. The economic benefits of large iron and steel plants are very large. Therefore, expanding the scale of iron and steel enterprises as much as possible has become a clear common trend in all major steel-producing countries in the world. For example, according to the situation in early 1955, 70% of the pig iron production capacity and 78% of the steel production capacity in the United States belonged to large factories with an annual production capacity of more than one million tons; Western European countries are also vigorously developing in this direction. Needless to say, socialist Soviet Union determined to establish a number of the largest iron and steel plants such as Kuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Zaporozhye, Azov Steel Plant, and New Tagil during the extremely difficult period of formulating the first Five-Year Plan, and even now they are still constantly building or expanding larger iron and steel plants. Their experience is worth our attention.

    4. In the past, we built large factories with foreign designs and complete sets of foreign equipment. This was absolutely necessary at the time. But doing so, of course, consumes more foreign exchange and takes a long time to build the factory. Now, we ourselves have considerable design strength, and we also have foreign standard designs as a reference. Therefore, we have the conditions to design faster and better according to domestic specific conditions in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The domestic machinery manufacturing industry has also grown, and the vast majority of metallurgical equipment can already be made by ourselves. In fact, even the equipment required for the largest steel plant, except for some of the latest machines and individual very large or special parts, our machinery manufacturing industry can make them. If we manufacture complete sets of equipment ourselves and only order machines and parts that we cannot make from abroad, then even if we build large factories, the number of orders that need to be placed abroad due to technical problems is not large. Therefore, the foreign exchange consumption and delivery time will be greatly reduced compared with the situation of building large factories in the past few years. Conversely, if we divide a large factory into several small factories, then the total weight of machinery and equipment will not be reduced, but may increase, and new problems may arise in terms of quantity.

    At the same time, concentrating domestic metallurgical equipment manufacturing capacity on making a large number of smaller and more backward equipment is not conducive to improving the technical level of machinery manufacturing, and will still cause difficulties for the establishment of large factories in the future, which may affect the overall development speed of the steel industry.

    5. Because the iron and steel industry is more suitable for large-scale development, and it is of great economic benefit for factories to be close to raw material bases, the iron and steel industry in all industrially advanced countries is always quite concentrated in terms of region. For example, the Soviet steel industry is concentrated in Ukraine, the Urals, and Siberia. In the United States, only three connected states in the east concentrate more than 58% of the country's steel production capacity, the Ruhr area of West Germany accounts for 80% of the country, France concentrates about 90% in the northeast corner, and the three concentrated areas in the United Kingdom also account for more than 66%. China's steel resources are more scattered, and the three bases of Anshan, Wuhan, and Baotou are thousands of kilometers away from each other. Other large steel resources that have now been discovered are scattered in various regions of the country, and also have the conditions to serve as the basis for new large iron and steel enterprises. In this way, we are gradually building large steel plants in many regions, and the situation in concentrated areas will be far less serious than in the above-mentioned countries.

    6. I believe that the main way to develop China's iron and steel industry should be the same as other countries, that is, to gradually establish large steel plants as much as possible in accordance with specific conditions (mainly the size of resources). Following Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, we still need many other large iron and steel enterprises. Because the construction of each large steel base requires a long period of complex work, we should not easily relax the work of establishing large iron and steel enterprises (exploration, design, ordering, equipment manufacturing, construction, etc.) due to other reasons. I feel that any relaxation at any time will have an adverse impact on the future development speed of the steel industry.

    **We must also oppose blindly pursuing large scale across the board.**

Even so, we not only have large iron ore resources, but also many small ones, such as resources of tens of millions of tons, millions of tons, or smaller. They are not sufficient to independently maintain a large steel plant, and may also be far from existing or future steel bases. It is also reasonable and necessary to establish medium and small factories in those locations to utilize resources nearby and meet local needs. Not only that, some products in the steel industry have special quality requirements but small quantities, which are originally suitable for small-scale production. Therefore, it is completely wrong to blindly pursue large scale across the board. Even large iron and steel enterprises can and should generally be built in stages in order to start production early and arrange investments rationally, and do not need to be very large in scale from the beginning. Vice Premier Bo Yibo pointed out in his report that the construction of large enterprises should be combined with the construction of medium and small-sized enterprises, and more medium and small-sized enterprises should be built in the future. This is also correct for the iron and steel industry, and especially needs correct coordination.

    The above reference opinions on the scale of iron and steel enterprises, although I have discussed with some comrades in the steel industry and also absorbed some of their opinions, are still very immature and are put forward for the representatives to criticize.

    钢的增产和党的领导
    邵象华谈反右派斗争的必要和发展我国钢铁工业的途径
    我完全同意国务院、常务委员会、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的报告。
    树立共产主义的世界观，现在尤为必要
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲演和周总理的报告又一次擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们能更好地辨别是非，认清前进的道路。作为钢铁工业工作的一分子，我参加了讲演中所提到的全国钢产量在短短七年中从十几万吨提高到四百几十万吨的工作。我理解钢产量的增长对于目前还是贫穷落后的我国的特别重大意义，也深切地体会到这巨大的成就是我们在党的领导下克服过多少管理上的、技术上的、物质上的和思想上的艰巨困难才达到的。我坚决相信只有社会主义制度，只有共产党的领导，才使我们能够达到已有的成绩，完成今后更艰巨的任务。因此，前一个时期出现的章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、葛佩琦等等对党诬蔑、企图推翻党的领导、退向资本主义的那些荒谬言论，是不能容忍的，我坚决反对。
    这次社会上的反右派斗争对我有极大的教育意义。回想最初在报纸上看到这类谬论的时候，我虽感到太片面、太夸张、太不符合事实而气愤，但当时并没能充分觉察出它的反党、反社会主义的危险本质。这说明自己虽然几年来也学习了一些马列主义，但政治嗅觉仍然是很不灵敏的。这是一响警钟，使我认识到加强政治学习、继续改造自己，树立无产阶级、共产主义的世界观，现在不但是仍然必要，而且更加必要了。我要牢记毛主席辨别是非的六条标准，作为衡量自己和别人的言行的准绳。
      鞍钢部分领导干部 缺乏踏实的工作作风
    我还想就钢铁工业的一些问题提点意见。党和政府经常号召增产节约、勤俭建国。几年来我们鞍钢职工响应中央号召，在这方面是取得了成绩的。例如，去年生铁生产比前年增加了35％，钢锭增加87％，钢材增加74％，四年完成了五年计划。但检查起来，浪费的成分也还不少。过去我们扩建的几个厂采用了可以说是国际的最高标准，其中有些东西现在看来是很可以节省的。只举几个例子，有的厂房采用了机械化开闭窗户的装置，有些非生产建筑太考究了些，也有某些机械化自动化的生产装置在目前并非必要，可以留待以后添设；在有的改建工程中对原有生产设备没有考虑充分利用，作了过多的拆除重建等等。这些都使我们的基建投资增大，投入生产时间延迟，是不符合增产节约的精神的。目前设计单位正在按照勤俭办企业的原则，对尚未建成的单位进行修改设计，我想这是非常必要的，而且相信可以省下不少钱来。
    在生产方面，鞍钢的缺点也还不少。我们由于设备事故、技术规程制度执行得不够好，以及技术水平低而造成的产量和质量上的损失还是不少的。若干质量要求较高的钢材也没有能充分供应用户。目前有一些定额指标同苏联的先进企业比起来还是落后的。
    为了更好地实现增产节约，我觉得我们需要改进企业管理。主要由于准备兄弟企业和本企业发展上的需要，目前鞍钢的机构是比较庞大的，人员多，各级领导干部也较多。我想如果能很好分工合作，人多一些本来也并不坏。但目前我们的部分领导干部（党员和非党员，行政和技术干部都有），比较缺乏一种踏踏实实的工作作风，有时倾向于单靠号召、布置进行领导，而不是深入群众，和大家一起工作，用具体指导和自己的榜样来进行领导。这样就不容易把工作真正作好，同时也不能提高群众和领导者自己的工作水平。因此，从领导起树立一种更踏实的工作作风，我看是十分必要的。党的整风无疑将使党员的工作作风更加改善；我觉得非党干部也需要、甚至更需要切实地整掉自己的毛病，提高思想作风。改进企业管理当然有很多内容，但我觉得这里谈的是比较根本的一点。
    毛主席指出在三个五年计划或再多一些时间我国的钢产量可能发展到二千万吨或更多。我们听了真是兴奋，而且将为超额完成这个目标而努力。在迅速发展钢铁工业的道路中需要正确解决许多重大问题；我想谈一下关于大、中、小型钢铁企业的配合建设问题。
      为了解决当前及今后一段时间的需要，在有条件的地方建立一批小企业是合理的
    我国土地广阔，运输条件相对的差，因此在有条件的地点建立小矿山、小炼铁厂、小炼焦厂、以至小炼钢轧钢厂，来帮助解决当地对金属的急需，是合理的。这样的企业可以采用简单的设备甚至手工业式的设备，基本上依靠地方的力量来建设，毋需占用多少全国性的设计、设备制造和施工等单位的力量；而且由于面广，能够在较短时间内就开始生产总数相当可观的铁和钢。这种厂的缺点是一般不能利用低品位的矿，许多副产品不能回收，原材料及劳动力消耗大，因此总的来讲对资源的耗用是比较浪费的。但如上面所说，为了解决当前以及今后一段时间内的需要，建立一批这样的小企业是合理的。
      建设大厂是世界各国的共同趋势，大厂的经济利益远远超过小厂
    至于谈到永久性的、多多少少现代化的钢铁企业，那末每一个企业的建设规模问题都必须根据具体条件对当前的和长远的利益加以仔细比较研究，才能够正确确定。但作为一般原则，我的想法是，对于生产大量需要的普通钢材的钢铁企业来讲（这类产品当然占全部钢材生产的极大比重），应该根据条件（主要是资源大小）尽可能建立规模大些的企业，而在资源条件不够建大厂的地方应建立中小企业。提出下面几点，作为考虑建厂规模的参考。
      1．一般讲，每吨生产能力的基建投资，大厂比小厂低（设备很简陋的近乎手工业性的小厂不算）。例如，苏联有人根据苏联现有各钢铁厂的资料得出如下关系：
    年产一百六十二万五千吨钢锭的工厂，每吨钢锭生产能力的基建投资为百分之百，那么，年产二百三十万吨的，投资只要89.3％，年产五百四十万吨的，投资只要81.9％。
    我国建钢铁厂较少，没有系统的比较资料，但冶金工业部出的冶金报不久前在一篇社论中说，办一个年产一百五十万吨的钢铁厂所需投资，可以用来办九个年产十六万吨的中小型钢铁厂，总生产能力相同，而投资还可节省一亿五千万元以上。这和上列的情况是不同的。据了解该社论所根据的实际例子并不是很适于比较的。但即使确有这一亿五千万元以上的逆差，由于我们过去大厂的设计标准太高等等原因（鞍钢的情况前面已谈过），如果注意节约，充分利用国内设备，估计大厂要减少这样一个数目的投资是很可能的。建议政府责成有关部门作出在我国建立不同大小的钢铁厂所需要的单位生产能力投资的估算，供今后建厂规划的参考。
      2．大厂的产品成本低，劳动生产率高。以一九五六年的实际数字为例，石景山、马鞍山、重庆等厂生铁的成本为鞍钢的一点一四至一点八二倍；天津、唐山、上海、重庆的钢锭成本为鞍钢的一点九至二点五倍；天津、唐山、上海、重庆小型钢材成本则为鞍钢的一点九至二点八倍。
  （这些数字中包含了某些原料调拨价同成本之间的差别的影响，但这影响比重不大）在劳动生产率方面，鞍钢每个炼铁工人产铁量为上列各厂的五至二十三倍，每个炼钢工人产钢量为四至六倍。值得特别指出的是，这些巨大的差别并不是由于其他各厂工作作得比鞍钢坏。恰恰相反，这些厂无论在企业管理上或在技术操作上都有许多地方比鞍钢作得好。它们的成本高和劳动生产率低，主要是由于规模太小，以及小厂总是会存在的一些其他不利条件。不难想像，大、小企业间成本和劳动生产率如此巨大的差别，对于国家的长远利益是有极大影响的。由于一个钢铁厂建成后要工作很长时间，这一点是特别需要考虑的。
    3．大钢铁厂的经济利益很大，因此尽可能扩大钢铁企业的规模，已经成为世界各主要产钢国家的鲜明的共同趋势。例如，按一九五五年初的情况，美国生铁生产能力的百分之七十和钢生产能力的百分之七十八是属于一百万吨以上年产能力的大厂的；西欧各国也在大力向此方向发展。社会主义的苏联就更不用说了，它在制订第一个五年计划的极为艰苦时期就确定建立库兹涅茨克、马格尼托哥尔斯克、查波罗什、亚速钢厂、新塔吉尔等许多个规模最大的钢铁厂，直到现在也还在不断建立或扩建更大的钢铁厂。他们的经验是值得我们重视的。
      4．过去我们建设大厂是国外设计，成套用国外设备。这在当时是完全必要的。但这样办当然消耗外汇较多，建厂时间也长。现在，我们自己已经有相当的设计力量，同时也有国外的标准设计作参考，因此有条件更快而且更好地根据国内具体条件按勤俭办企业的原则来进行设计。国内的机械制造业也成长了，极大部分的冶金设备已经可以自制。事实上即使是最大的钢铁厂所需的设备，除有些最新机器及个别特大的或特殊的部件以外，我们的机械制造业是能够作出来的。如果自制成套设备，只向国外订配自己所不能作的机器和部件，那末即使办大厂，由于技术问题而需要向国外订货的数量也是不多的，因此外汇消耗和交货时间都会比过去几年办大厂的情况大为减少。反之，如果把一个大厂分成几个小厂办，那末总的机器设备重量按常理不是减少，而可能增大，又可能产生数量方面的新问题。
      同时，把国内冶金设备制造能力集中于制作大量较小型的、较落后的设备，对于提高机械制造的技术水平是不利的，对于以后建立大厂仍将造成困难，可能会影响总的钢铁工业发展速度。
      5．由于钢铁工业较宜大规模开发，同时工厂靠近原料基地有重大经济利益，所以各工业先进国的钢铁工业就地区上讲总是相当集中的。例如，苏联钢铁工业集中在乌克兰、乌拉尔和西伯利亚。美国四十八州中只东部三个相连的州就集中了全国钢铁生产能力的百分之五十八以上，西德鲁尔区占全国百分之八十，法国在东北一角集中了百分之九十左右，英国三个集中地区也占百分之六十六以上。我国钢铁资源分布较散，鞍山、武汉和包头三个基地相互距离数千公里。现在已经探知的其他大的钢铁资源，分散在全国的各地区，也有条件作为新的大钢铁企业的基础。这样，我们在许多地区陆续建立大钢铁厂，集中地区情况将远不如上述各国严重。
      6．我以为发展我国钢铁工业的主要途径应该和其他各国一样，就是按照具体条件（主要是资源大小）尽可能陆续建立大钢铁厂。继鞍钢、武钢、包钢之后，我们还需要许许多多其他的大型钢铁企业。由于每一个大钢铁基地的建设都需要较长时间的复杂工作，我们不宜由于其他原因而轻易放松建立大钢铁企业的工作（勘探，设计，订货，设备制造，施工等等）。我觉得任何一时期的放松，都会对以后的钢铁工业发展速度发生不利影响。
      也要反对盲目地一律追求大规模
    虽然如此，我们不但有大的铁矿资源，也有不少小的，如几千万吨、几百万吨或更小的资源。它们不足以独立地维持大型钢铁厂，距离已有的或将建的钢铁基地可能也远。在那些地点建立中小厂，就近利用资源，满足地方需要，也是合理而且需要的。不但如此，钢铁工业中有些产品质量要求特殊而数量不大，本来就适宜于小规模生产。因此盲目地一律追求大规模，是十分不对的。甚至大型钢铁企业，为了提早开始生产和合理安排投资，一般也可以而且应该分期建设，并不需要从头起就规模很大的。薄一波副总理在他的报告中指出，大型企业的建设要同中、小型企业的建设相结合，并且今后应该多建中、小型企业。这对钢铁工业来讲也是正确的，而且特别需要正确的配合。
    以上关于钢铁企业的规模的参考意见，虽然曾经和一些钢铁界的同志谈过，而且也吸收了他们的一些意见，但仍然是很不成熟的，提出来请代表们批评。
