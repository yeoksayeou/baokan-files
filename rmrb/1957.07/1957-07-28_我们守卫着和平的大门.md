We Guard the Gate of Peace
Chinese People's Volunteer Army Qin Lin

Here is an ordinary mountain peak on the "38th Parallel," yet people call it the heroic position of Shangganling, because comrades once established merits for peace here. We feel extremely honored to be stationed here; this is the gate of peace.

At the foot of "Hill 597.9" lies a tortuous "Military Demarcation Line," which is also a boundary between brutality and justice, because the worst things in the world—war, conspiracy, sin, and shamelessness—can all originate from the south side of this line.

Four years ago, American imperialism launched an offensive here. The enemy's shells blew away the stones on the hilltop by two meters, but the heroic position still stood tall before the enemy. Four years ago, on the day the armistice agreement was signed, the soldiers witnessed the Americans obediently following the representatives of China and North Korea, delineating the boundary line here. At that time, the soldiers who ran out of the tunnels were simply ecstatic. This was a victory for the Chinese and Korean people.

After the ceasefire, the soldiers guarded their posts day and night. In the winter nights, the cold wind pierced the hands that tightly held their weapons, and the heavy snow buried their frozen bodies; in the rainy nights of summer and autumn, the rain soaked their close-fitting shirts, and mosquitoes bit them all over, causing red and swollen skin, but the soldiers remained motionless on the ground, exploring every suspicious movement. As long as the enemy dared to cross the demarcation line by one step, the fate of being captured awaited them. Not long ago, a South Korean spy sneaked into our area and was caught by us. The surprised enemy called our soldiers "night ghosts."

This is the front line for defending peace, and also our home; comrades are as close as brothers, and the leaders are like mothers. On the top of the mountain irrigated by the blood of martyrs, the soldiers cultivated a vegetable garden, and the lush green vegetables grew very vigorously. Sunflowers are already more than one person tall. Soon, the beautiful sunflowers will announce to the sun and to the people, "Shangganling heroic position has a bumper harvest." A few days ago, the soldiers sent the first batch of products—bok choy—to the comrades of the Korean People's Army. Captain Kim of the People's Army said kindly in Chinese: "It's not easy for Shangganling to produce bok choy! It's nourished by the blood of the martyrs and your sweat."

The friendship between Chinese and Korean soldiers is unparalleled. We are "distant relatives" and "close neighbors," making us even closer. Many soldiers of the People's Army participated in China's revolutionary struggles in the past, and they often talk about the situation in China with the Volunteer Army soldiers. During breaks, Chinese and Korean soldiers "visit relatives" with each other, talk about family matters, from fighting the enemy, honing their skills, all the way to their personal backgrounds. We know each of their names, this one is from the Yellow Sea, that one is from Pyongyang; they also know who has an Amani (mother) in our home, and who has an Abaji (father). Captain Kim is a skilled dancer, and whenever he comes, we pick up the accordion, and even the soldiers who can't dance follow him and dance.

North of the demarcation line echoes the song of peaceful labor, but from the south, there is often the sound of artillery fire. In June of this year, American imperialism brazenly violated the armistice agreement and transported new weapons into South Korea. On "June 25th" that noon, five American planes intruded into our airspace. Seeing this situation, boundless anger surged into the hearts of the Chinese and Korean soldiers. A few days ago, the famous film "Shangganling" was shown here, and the battle four years ago reappeared before the eyes of the Chinese and Korean soldiers. We silently issued a warning facing the south: if the American aggressors dare to re-ignite the war, an even more merciless blow than four years ago awaits them!

The Volunteer Army has been fighting abroad for nearly seven years, and the ceasefire has been in place for four years. In these long years, the soldiers have been missing their motherland and relatives every moment. Whenever they complete combat missions or return from patrols, the soldiers gather around the stove, or huddle in the shade of the trees in summer, talking about things that will never end—the past, present, and future of the motherland. At this time, the soldiers are like infants throwing themselves into the arms of a loving mother, forgetting their tiredness, and feeling only happiness. The four years after the ceasefire were precisely the four years when the people of the motherland were striving to over fulfill the first five-year plan. Every construction achievement of the motherland encouraged the soldiers' fighting enthusiasm. From here, the soldiers realized the significance of persevering in the struggle.

The night is deep. The peaceful night of the motherland appears before my eyes again: the people of the motherland have entered sweet dreams after a day of hard work; the fire of the open-hearth furnace illuminates the night sky red; scientists and scholars are writing outstanding papers under the lights; the kind mother is thinking of her long-lost son, silently instructing him: to guard the gate of peace well; our great leader Chairman Mao, is planning everything for 600 million people...

Dear motherland, dear mother, dear leader! Rest assured, we will definitely be able to guard the gate of peace!

On Shangganling, Captain Kim of the People's Army starts to sway his shoulders and dance the Ongheya dance as soon as he hears the sound of the accordion.

    我们守卫着和平的大门
    中国人民志愿军　琴林
    这里是“三八线”上的一个普通山峰，然而人们都管它叫作英雄阵地上甘岭，因为战友们曾经在这里为和平立下了功勋。我们守卫在这里感到无比的光荣，这里是和平的大门。
    “五九七·九高地”的脚下，是一条曲折的“军事分界线”，也是一条残暴与正义的疆界，因为世界上最坏的东西——战争、阴谋、罪恶与无耻，都可以从这条线的南面产生。
    四年前，美帝国主义曾经在这里发起进攻。敌人的炮弹把山头上的石头掀走了两公尺，但是英雄阵地仍然高高地屹立在敌人的眼前。四年前停战协定签字那天，战士们亲眼看到了美国佬乖乖地跟随着朝中代表，在这里划定了分界线。那时，从坑道里跑出来的战士们高兴得简直发狂。这是中朝人民的胜利。
    停战后，战士们日夜守卫在自己的岗位上。在冬夜，寒风刺穿了紧握着武器的双手，大雪掩埋了冻僵的身躯；在夏秋的雨夜，雨水浸透了贴身的衬衣，蚊虫叮得遍体红肿，但是战士们总是一动不动地伏在地下，探索着每一丝可疑的动静。只要敌人胆敢跨过分界线一步，做俘虏的命运就等待着他。不久以前，南朝鲜一个特务刚摸进我方地区，就被我们捉住了。吃惊的敌人把我们的战士称作“夜游神”。
    这里是保卫和平的前线，也是我们的家；战友们像兄弟般的亲热，首长和母亲一样。在烈士鲜血灌溉过的山顶上，战士们开拓了一块菜园，绿油油的蔬菜长得很茁壮。向日葵已经有一人多高了。不久，美丽的葵花便会向太阳、向人们宣布“上甘岭英雄阵地大丰收”。前几天，战士们把这里的首批产品——小白菜送给朝鲜人民军的战友。人民军金队长亲切地用中国话说：“上甘岭生产出白菜真不简单啊！这是烈士的鲜血和你们的汗水滋养大的。”
    中朝战士的友情是无法比拟的。我们是“远亲”又是“近邻”，亲上加亲。人民军的很多战士，过去曾经参加过中国的革命斗争，他们常和志愿军战士们谈中国的情形。每当休息的时候，中朝战士互相“串亲戚”，谈家常，从对敌斗争、锻炼本领，一直谈到个人身世。我们知道他们每一个人的名字，这个是黄海人，那个是平壤人；他们也知道我们那个家里有阿妈尼（妈妈），那个家里有阿巴基（爸爸）。金队长是个舞蹈能手，每逢他来的时候，我们就拉起手风琴，不会跳舞的战士也跟着他跳起来。
    分界线北边响彻着和平劳动的歌声，然而从南面却经常传来隆隆的炮声。今年6月间，美帝国主义悍然破坏停战协定，把新式武器运进南朝鲜。就在“六·二五”那天中午，还有五架美国飞机窜扰我方上空。看到这种情况，无比的愤怒涌上了中朝战士的心头。前几天在这里放映了有名的影片“上甘岭”，四年前的战斗重现在中朝战士的眼前。我们面向南方默默地发出警告：美国侵略者胆敢重新挑起战争，比四年前更加无情的打击在等待着它！
    志愿军出国作战已将近七年，停战也有四年了。在这漫长的岁月里，战士们每时每刻都在怀念着祖国，想念着亲人。每当完成战斗任务或是巡逻归来，战士们就围在火炉旁边，或是拥在夏日的树荫里，谈起了永远谈不完的事情——祖国的过去、现在和未来。这时候，战士们就像婴儿投入慈母怀抱似的，忘记了困倦，感到的只有幸福。停战后的四年，正是祖国人民为超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗的四年，祖国的每项建设成就都鼓舞着战士们的斗争热情，从这里战士们体会到坚持斗争的意义。
    夜深了。祖国的安详之夜又显现在我的眼前：祖国的人民在一天辛勤劳动之后进入了甜美的梦乡；马丁炉的火光把夜空照得通红；科学家、学者正在灯下撰写出色的论文；慈祥的妈妈在思念着久别的儿子、默默地嘱咐着：要好好地守住和平的大门；我们的伟大领袖毛主席，正在为六亿人民筹划着一切……。
  亲爱的祖国，亲爱的妈妈，亲爱的领袖！您们放心吧，我们一定能守住和平的大门！
    在上甘岭上，人民军金队是听到手风琴一响，就晃动着肩膀跳开嗡哩呀舞。
