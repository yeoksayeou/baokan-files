Thoroughly Crush the Rightist Ambitionists
Lan Gongwu's Speech

The ugly anti-communist and anti-socialist alliance of rightist ambitionists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji has been exposed. They still want to gloss over their mistakes and muddle through, which cannot be allowed. These consistent political opportunists and brokers, who have lived in the land where the laboring people hold power for nearly eight years, have never forgotten their selfish personal interests. They took advantage of the "blooming of a hundred flowers and the contention of a hundred schools of thought" and the Communist Party's rectification campaign to move around, stirring up trouble everywhere, and launching a frantic attack on the Party with despicable means of rumor-mongering and slander, saying things like "there is no heaven and no law" and "having a title but no power." They妄图tried to replace the people's democratic dictatorship with their cherished capitalist "bicameral system" through a so-called "political design institute," which is infuriating to hear.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I have been working in the old liberated areas and in the cities for twelve years now. I have come into contact with countless high-ranking Party cadres, and they have impressed me with their enthusiasm and sincerity. In my work, I have received help and support, and I have become more deeply aware that only the Communist Party is an enthusiastic, selfless party, a long-tested party belonging to the people, and the only guiding light for the people of the motherland. The Party's spirit of hard work, perseverance, and seeking truth from facts has always deeply moved me.

Today, everyone who has seen enough of the reactionary groups fighting for power and putting the people in misery in the old society, everyone who has suffered the humiliation of the imperialist rulers, and every honest person, when they see the great socialist construction of the motherland advancing by leaps and bounds, when the living standards of the people of the motherland are constantly improving and they firmly control their own destiny, when the motherland stands independently and freely in the world and the people are proud of it, people thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts. Everyone knows that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no youthful life of the motherland today. Historical ironclad evidence is irrefutable.

As a member of the National People's Congress, I have the responsibility to demand that rightist ambitionists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji make a thorough confession. Their two-faced tactics of being insincere and pretending to be progressive have been exposed, and the true face of the monsters and demons has been revealed. Any illusions will only lead to self-destruction by the people.

I have been ill for a long time and cannot attend this National People's Congress. In this struggle against the rightists, I am ashamed of my lack of strength. I would like to take this opportunity to express some feelings and vow to unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party. In order to safeguard the interests of socialism, we must thoroughly crush the rightist ambitionists and smash the Zhang-Luo alliance.

    彻底打垮右派野心家
    蓝公武的发言
    章伯钧、罗隆基等右派野心家丑恶的反共反社会主义联盟已被揭露出来，他们还想避重就轻蒙混过关，这是决不能够容许的。他们这班一贯政治投机掮客，生活在劳动人民掌握了政权的土地上虽然已近八年，却念念不忘那种见不得天日的个人私利，竟利用百花齐放、百家争鸣，乘共产党整风的机会，四出活动，到处点火，以造谣污蔑的可耻手段向党发动疯狂的进攻，说什么“有天无法”、“有职无权”，妄图以所谓“政治设计院”代替人民民主专政，实现他们所醉心的资本主义“两院制”，听来令人发指。
    在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我从参加老解放区工作到进入城市至今已经十二年了，我接触过无数的党的高级干部，他们给我的印象是热诚和朴实，在工作中我得到的是帮助和支持，因而我愈益深切地认识到只有共产党是热情洋溢大公无私的党，是久经考验的属于人民的党，是祖国人民唯一的指路明灯。党的艰苦奋斗毅力和实事求是精神，更无时不在深深地感动着我。
    今天，每一个在旧社会看够了反动集团争权夺利置人民于水火的人，每一个受过帝国主义统治者屈辱的人，每一个正直的人，当看到祖国伟大社会主义建设飞跃前进的时候，当祖国人民生活水平不断提高牢固地掌握了自己命运的时候，当祖国独立自由屹然立于世界而人民引以自豪的时候，人们是从心坎里感谢共产党和毛主席的。谁也知道，离开了共产党的领导，就不会有今天祖国生命的青春，历史铁证已无可辩驳。
    我作为全国人民代表大会代表之一员，有责任要求章伯钧、罗隆基等右派野心家彻底交代，口是心非伪装进步的两面手法已经拆穿，牛鬼蛇神的庐山真面已经暴露，任何幻想只会自绝于人民。
    我久病不能出席这次全国人民代表大会，在此反右派的斗争中，自愧力不从心，借此表明一些感触，誓与全国人民一致团结在党的领导下，为了维护社会主义利益，必须彻底打垮右派野心家，粉碎章罗联盟。
