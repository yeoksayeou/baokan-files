I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and other reports.

The Situation and Problems of the Motor Manufacturing Industry

China's motor industry, as an independent manufacturing sector, has actually only gradually developed since the national liberation. Over the past seven years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and through the hard work of all employees, it has achieved rapid development and is gradually realizing the arduous historical task of transitioning from a repair and assembly industry to a manufacturing industry. Manufacturing capacity and technical level have significantly improved, and new varieties have greatly developed. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the motor manufacturing industry will create approximately 6.3 billion yuan of output value for the country, of which the output value of enterprises directly under the central ministries has completed the Five-Year Plan one year and four months ahead of schedule. Of the 45 types of products planned under the ministry, taking 12 major products as an example, it has provided the country with the following over the past five years: 1. 49 water turbines with 219,488 kilowatts; 2. 787,677 kilowatts of AC generators; 3. 4,800,408 kilowatts of AC motors; 4. 292,911 kilowatts of DC motors; 5. 12,310,023 kilovolt-amperes of transformers; 6. 39,059 high-voltage circuit breakers; 7. 115,472 switchboards; 8. 1,312,192 electrical instruments; 9. 117,656 tons of bare copper wire (motor department only); 10. 2,047,990 kilometers of rubber wire; 11. 52,828 kilometers of power cable; 12. 10,457 kilometers of telecommunications cable. Most of these 12 major products, from the perspective of enterprises directly under the ministry, have completed the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, and can complete more than 1,800 new products during the five-year period. Comparing three products with the highest annual output in history: this year's production of generators will be 284,450 kilowatts, which is 14.1 times the highest annual output of 20,179 kilowatts in 1947; this year's production of motors will be 1,251,073 kilowatts, which is 24.5 times the highest annual output of 51,020 kilowatts in 1947; this year's production of transformers will be 3,589,000 kilovolt-amperes, which is 23.3 times the highest annual output of 15,388 kilovolt-amperes in 1942. Before liberation, all power generation equipment above 500 kilowatts, medium and large-sized transformer equipment, etc., were imported from abroad, but now we can manufacture: (1) complete sets of electrical equipment for medium and small-sized thermal power plants of 12,000 kilowatts and below; (2) complete sets of power generation equipment for hydroelectric power stations of 15,000 kilowatts and below; (3) complete sets of power transmission and distribution equipment for power systems of 110,000 volts and below; (4) complete sets of electrical transmission equipment required for blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and small and medium-sized steel rolling equipment in the metallurgical sector; (5) electrical transmission equipment for underground machinery in the coal and petroleum industries, as well as electric locomotives for above-ground and underground use; (6) supporting electrical equipment required for the machinery industry and some electrical equipment for marine and national defense use; (7) electrical equipment for light industries such as sugar refining and textiles.

In short, the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan are remarkable, and these were unimaginable before liberation. In order to meet the needs of the development of China's socialist industrial construction, we are also preparing to trial-produce some large-capacity, high-voltage, and precise high-end products, such as 25,000 kilowatt and 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generators, 72,500 kilowatt hydro turbine generator sets, 4,000 kilowatt motors, 80-ton mining electric locomotives, 220,000 volt air circuit breakers, and are starting to research 220,000 volt 63,000 kilovolt-ampere transformers, electric furnaces for steelmaking under 45 tons, and hydroelectric equipment above 100,000 kilowatts for the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station.

Railway electrification has been actively adopted by countries all over the world. The Qinling section of China's Baoji-Chengdu Railway is also designed according to the electrification standard, with a gradient of 30‰, but currently, two steam locomotives have to be used for traction. Due to the large gradient (steam locomotive traction, the gradient cannot exceed 23‰), the transportation volume is greatly limited. When going downhill, braking causes friction and sparks, which looks like a fire dragon at night. This kind of operation not only causes severe wear and tear on locomotives and rails but is also dangerous. If electric locomotives are used for traction and electrification is implemented, this problem can be solved. Therefore, I believe that the early trial production and manufacturing of electric locomotives are of great significance for the development of electrification in China's mountainous areas and areas with heavy transportation. I hope the state can grasp this work tightly.

From the perspective of the economic benefits of the motor manufacturing industry, labor productivity has completed the Five-Year Plan nearly two years ahead of schedule, and cost reduction has also completed the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. At present, the prices of motor products are basically reasonable compared with those at home and abroad, and the quality of products can generally meet current requirements. At the same time, in the five years, in addition to taxes and depreciation, it has also turned over more than 700 million yuan of profits to the state, while the state's investment in the motor manufacturing industry sector in the five years is only 489 million yuan. That is to say, the state's five-year investment has actually been recovered through the turnover of profits within three years. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we have helped China rebuild or expand many motor manufacturing plants and have also built a batch of modern motor manufacturing plants. The Shenyang Cable Factory and the Harbin Instrument Factory, which were put into production last year, and this year, the mercury rectifier workshop of the Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Factory, the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, and the Harbin Electric Brush Factory have begun trial production. The completion and commissioning of these new types of factories will provide China with motor products that could not be produced in the past, and will become the backbone of the motor manufacturing industry sector. In short, the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and the completion of these backbone factories will lay a preliminary foundation for the electrical equipment needed for China's industrial electrification. At the same time, through existing enterprises, a group of new enterprise management cadres and technical forces have been trained. Facts show that the friendship forged by the mutual support between socialist countries is unbreakable.

All these ironclad facts have been obtained under the mutual support and cooperation of the working people of the whole country and fully demonstrate the superiority of the planned economy. This cannot be denied or erased by the right-wing elements.

I participated in inspections in Shanghai last December and from April to June this year, focusing on the motor manufacturing industry. The inspections confirmed the facts mentioned above. Now I want to reflect on some shortcomings and problems that currently exist in the motor manufacturing industry:

(1) Product quality. With the development of the motor industry, there are more varieties, higher quality requirements, and stricter technical conditions for products, especially for new and advanced products. However, the lack of standardization in production and the instability and low quality of products are all key issues in the current motor industry production and are the main obstacles on the road to progress. A series of product quality problems such as insensitive operation and poor insulation of some switching equipment, oil leakage from transformers, and high motor temperature and noisy bearings have not yet been completely resolved. Therefore, the enterprises of the current Motor Manufacturing Industry Department have made strengthening technology and improving product quality the central task this year, striving to improve.

(2) Judging from the development speed of the motor manufacturing industry, it is very fast. Last year, the output value increased by 65.5%, and this year's output value plan is to increase by 16.3%, which is relatively the highest among the 13 industrial sectors. However, most of the motor products produced are still in short supply. In terms of this year's planned output, it still cannot meet the needs, making the needed departments feel nervous. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to increase the production of 200,000 kilowatts of motors, more than 200,000 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 5,000 kilowatts of DC motors, 460 kilometers of power cable, 250 kilometers of telecommunications cable, 10,000 kilometers of rubber wire, 200 tons of electromagnetic wire, and 800 high-voltage switchboards. This shows that the country's need for motor industry products is urgent, and attention should be paid to ensuring that the development steps of the motor industry do not lag behind the country's needs.

(3) The motor manufacturing industry requires assistance and cooperation from many parties. At the same time, the motor products produced are supplied to various departments of industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational departments. The large shafts (rotors) and guard rings, silicon steel sheets (including hot-rolled silicon steel sheets and cold-rolled silicon steel sheets that should be used in the future), and advanced insulation materials (including glass silk, organic silicon, high-strength paint, and advanced insulation paper, etc.) used in the 6,000 kilowatt and 12,000 kilowatt generators currently manufactured still rely on imports. However, if measures can be taken, most of these can be manufactured domestically. It is just that the small batch size and high requirements may affect the output value, cost, and labor productivity of the manufacturing department. The manufacturing department has not been able to actively trial-produce and manufacture. I think that considering the overall interests of the country, relevant departments should actively trial-produce and produce to support the development of the motor industry, ensure the electrical equipment needed by the entire industry, and save foreign exchange.

(4) The 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator produced by the Shanghai Motor Factory has been mass-produced since the trial production was successful in 1954. So far, 25 units have been produced, and 18 units have been installed or are being installed by the demanding departments. This means that there are still seven finished and semi-finished products stockpiled in factories and sales departments. The 6,000 kilowatt large shafts and guard rings are all imported from abroad, with a total order of 62 units, and other materials have also been prepared. The current problem is that the user departments, mainly the power departments, are unwilling to use them (especially after the production of the 12,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator), on the grounds that it is too small and uneconomical to be placed in a large power grid, and too large to be used in general power stations outside the power grid. In fact, two 6,000 kilowatt units can be used in parallel to replace one 12,000 kilowatt unit, although it will affect the increase in the construction area of the factory building to some extent, but it is not serious. This problem shows that the user departments and the manufacturing industry departments should proceed from reality, coordinate with each other, and formulate unified plans and technical policies. I hope the state will make a special case of this problem as soon as possible and actively arrange it.

The Situation of Cadres in the Industrial Sector and the Training of Young Intellectuals

Another problem I encountered and saw during the inspection is the situation of cadres in the industrial sector and the training of young intellectuals.

After liberation, in order to meet the needs of industrial construction for cadres, the state has taken effective measures, such as retaining the original technical personnel, promoting from workers, calling on those who have studied industry to return to the team, transferring cadres to other industries, and uniformly distributing college graduates, etc. This has basically solved the urgent needs of the industrial sector and production enterprises, especially young intellectuals accounting for a large proportion. In the practice of work and study, many cadres have changed from laymen to experts, and their technical level and management level have been greatly improved. In addition, college graduates have been continuously and massively enriching the industrial sector over the years. Therefore, the number of cadres needed in the industrial sector, especially the leading organs, does not seem to be as tight as it used to be.

Under the infinite care of the Party and Chairman Mao over the past eight years, a new intellectual community of young people in China is growing rapidly. From 1949 to 1956, there were 302,000 graduates from national colleges and universities, and there were still 443,000 college students in school. It can be said that this team has a considerable scale. Chairman Mao said well: "Our college students, although many of them are children from non-working people's families, except for a few exceptions, are patriotic and support socialism." Among the college graduates who have already graduated, about 100,000 graduates majoring in industrial technology and industrial economics have embarked on various jobs on the industrial construction front. Under the specific training of the Party, they have made great progress in the upsurge of marching towards science and in the training of practical work.

I very much agree with Chairman Mao's report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" repeatedly emphasizing the strengthening of ideological and political education and labor education for young students. This is the most urgent work for young students at present. Our current task is to earnestly and actively participate in the struggle to counterattack the right-wing elements. In order to implement the spirit of labor education, I think the work distribution of college graduates should be improved. The issue of "consistent learning and application" that graduates are most concerned about has been basically resolved, but there are still some problems as to where to "apply" it. In recent years, when allocating graduates, various departments have mostly allocated them to work in leading organs and research departments, and only a few have been delegated to grassroots production units. On the one hand, this makes the needs of enterprises not met, and on the other hand, it makes the mentors of scientific institutions overburdened, the leading organs are overstaffed, and individuals cannot carry out their work and feel distressed. Therefore, they require to go to grassroots production departments, and are willing to go out of the greenhouse to withstand the wind and frost and exercise themselves, so that theory and practice can be combined. In fact, labor is beneficial to anyone. Students participating in a certain period of production and physical labor can not only learn a lot of knowledge, but also change their views and feelings about the working people, and can closely link the relationship between physical labor and mental labor. This is especially true for children from non-working people's families, especially young intellectuals who have been living in schools for more than ten years since elementary school, middle school, and university and have never actually worked in production units. I think this is very correct, and I suggest that relevant departments gradually meet their requirements and let them go to grassroots production units for training. Of course, in specific arrangements, some difficulties will be encountered due to the issues of majors and volunteers and the caliber of personnel needed by enterprises, but as long as various departments are willing to let them go to the grassroots and explain it to them clearly, this will be achieved.

For the allocation of college graduates this summer, in addition to a small number of graduates retained by schools and research institutions as teaching assistants, graduate students, and assistants to scientists, the rest should be allowed to go to the grassroots, those who study engineering to factories, and those who study agriculture to farms or agricultural cooperatives. In general, they should be allowed to exercise steadily in actual work for two to five years, which is very beneficial and will gradually form a national system. It was difficult to implement this method in the past few years. Now, according to the situation of cadres in the industrial sector that I mentioned earlier, I think there are conditions and it can be implemented.

At present, it is very difficult for leading organs and scientific research departments to transfer some experienced people from the grassroots to work. After implementing this method, the current situation can be changed. Some factory directors said that if this spirit is implemented, the factory can be responsible for training and responsible for transportation. I think it is better for leading organs and scientific research organs to absorb people with certain practical work experience to work or do scientific research than to retain just graduated students.

Refuting Huang Shaohong's "Vindication" for the Counter-Revolutionary Element Han Guoping

Huang Shaohong, at the CPPCC meeting on March 12 this year, used a special example to accuse a so-called case sentenced in Longguan County, Hebei Province, which is the case of Han Guoping, a backbone member of the counter-revolutionary party group. Huang Shaohong's speech was published in the upper left corner of the third page of the People's Daily on March 14. The basis of his speech was the family members of the defendant who wrote to him and asked him to report the situation three times and five times since July last year, and according to the situation reflected by the defendant's family members, he severely accused the Longguan County Court of sentencing Han Guoping, a counter-revolutionary element, to eight years in prison. After the provincial court changed it to education and release, "If it were not for encountering the high court that conscientiously implemented supervision, it would not have received the state's lenient treatment, or it would have been drowned in injustice."

Please pay special attention to his conclusion of "drowned in injustice". Was it really drowned in injustice? Now I will introduce to you the main situation of Han Guoping's sabotage of the student movement and counter-revolutionary activities before and after liberation for your analysis.

Han Guoping, male, 30 years old, student composition, from Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province. He used to study in Beijing, and then in 1944 he transferred to Taiyuan Industrial School to study and joined the Kuomintang in the school, serving as the secretary of the district branch and the secretary of the district party department. He organized a propaganda team in the school and personally served as the captain to engage in anti-communist speeches on the streets and in cinemas, published wall newspapers, and carried out reactionary propaganda such as "Unifying China is to destroy the Communist Party."

In 1947, Han Guoping entered the History Department of Fu Jen Catholic University. Soon after, he colluded with Kuomintang secret agent Xing Lianzhong (Xing is the secretary of the second team of the underground work of the bandit "Confidential Bureau Public Education Youth Salvation Corps" and the "North China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters Pioneer Team" led by international spy Lei Zhenyuan and military secret agent Diao Huren), reactionary element Pang Guangshan, and others, manipulated reactionary elements and backward students, attacked and persecuted progressive students, and sabotaged the student movement. He persecuted Yang Guanglie, Lu Zhifang, Yang Shaohan, and other members of our underground revolutionary organization. One day, Han Guoping and others lured Yang Guanglie to their dormitory. Surrounded by a dozen reactionary elements, they threatened Yang Guanglie with force and almost started a fight. Fortunately, Comrade Chang Huaiguang came up with a way to drag Yang Guanglie away, so he was not accidentally injured.

Han Guoping often mingled with students to monitor the activities of progressive students and secretly checked the bookcases and bags of progressive students. After Fan Guangdou, a progressive student of Fu Jen Catholic University, was arrested by the Kuomintang, Yang Guanglie, Lu Zhifang, and others launched a rescue movement. The students in the class wrote a rescue letter. Han Guoping, Xing Lianzhong, and others twice asked Yang Guanglie about the names of the letter writers, forcing Yang, Lu, and others to leave Beijing.

After the liberation of Beijing, from April to August 1950, when Han Guoping was a trainee at the Liberal Arts Institute of Peking University and also served as a teacher at the Dongdan Elephant Nose Pit Adult Night School, he obstructed young people from joining the army and the League, and took the opportunity to spread reactionary remarks. Wang Shuxian (female), a student at the night school, wanted to join the military cadre school. Han Guoping went to Wang Shuxian's home, pretended to be kind, and used Wang Shuxian's mother's pain for her daughter to say to Wang Shuxian's mother: "It's not good for girls to join the army, and the work place is far away..." He also said to Wang Shuxian, "You have to consider it, don't regret it. I don't care if your mother wants someone from me. What if your mother hangs herself?" In this way, he prevented Wang Shuxian from joining the army. Han spread rumors among the night school students, slandering and saying: "The Communist Party is good at using people, and the members of the League are playing tricks (meaning men and women are mixed)." After Han Guoping heard the news that teacher Chen Youhe requested to join the League, he said to Chen, "You really don't know how powerful the League is. The League is not allowed to marry non-members. After joining the League, you will not be free." When female members of the class went to the street League branch to study, Han said to classmate Qian Lanying: "Isn't it just messing around together?"

Han took the opportunity to promote the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea in the suburbs and said to the farmers: "You have seen the end of the landlords, and you will also fall down when your lives are improved in the future..." He sabotaged land reform.

Based on his reactionary performance, the Liberal Arts Institute of Peking University and the Dongdan District Cultural and Educational Section, which led the night school, expelled Han Guoping in August and October 1951, respectively.

In 1952, after Han Guoping arrived at the Chahar South Workers and Peasants Cadre Supplementary School, he did not settle down to teaching and continued to carry out sabotage activities. Han's dormitory was in the home of an old farmer. He urinated in front of the old landlady, violated mass discipline, and aroused the old farmer's disgust. The old farmer immediately reported him to the school. This incident caused dissatisfaction among the majority of teachers and students. All the teachers and students jointly reported Han Guoping. In order to further help Han Guoping change, the education authorities made him participate in the teacher's ideological transformation study in the autumn of 1952 and transferred him from the Chahar South Cultural Supplementary School to work in the Longguan County Cadre Spare-time School, repeatedly waiting for him to wake up. However, Han Guoping was still not honest after arriving in Longguan, provoking colleagues to be disunited, inciting students to confront the leaders and the government, and wooing teacher Chang Yuandu, saying: "You have to fall to my side and let Yang Songnian (director of teaching) step down."

According to the National Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, Han Guoping is a backbone member of the counter-revolutionary party group and the secretary of the Kuomintang District Party Department. Not only did he sabotage the student movement and carry out counter-revolutionary activities before liberation, but after liberation, Han Guoping did not thoroughly confess his crimes in the past suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He only confessed to general problems, concealed the main details, and insisted on a reactionary position. In the course of several years of teaching, he still did not honestly assume the obligations of a people's teacher, often spreading reactionary remarks and sabotaging revolutionary work. Longguan County arrested Han in accordance with the law in August 1955. After in-depth education and repeated verification of the sabotage facts, after preliminary review and public trial investigation, Han still did not have a correct understanding of all the sabotage facts. It was correct and appropriate for Longguan County to arrest and sentence such a counter-revolutionary element.

I want to ask Huang Shaohong, has it been "drowned in injustice" that such a counter-revolutionary element as Han Guoping has received the education and due punishment of the people's government? Please do not blindly "vindicate" counter-revolutionary elements, but listen to the people's opinions! Your accusations are unfounded. I think you are not a representative of the people, but a representative of counter-revolutionaries. The people cannot allow you to use your status as a people's representative to cover up counter-revolutionary elements.

We must continue to implement the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected," thoroughly smash the conspiracy of the right-wing elements to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, and resolutely march towards socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    谈电机工业的发展并驳斥黄绍竑为反革命分子“申冤”
    田德民的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理的报告及其他各项报告。
    电机制造工业的情况和问题
    我国电机工业，作为一个独立的制造工业部门，实际上还是在全国解放以后才逐步发展起来的。七年多来，在党和政府的正确领导下，经过了全体职工辛勤的劳动，获得了迅速的发展，正在逐步地实现从修配工业过渡到制造工业这一艰巨的历史任务。制造能力、技术水平都有显著的提高，新的品种有了很大的发展。在第一个五年计划期间，电机制造工业将为国家创造约六十三亿元的产值，其中中央部属企业的产值已经提前一年零四个月完成了五年计划。部管计划产品共四十五种，以其中十二种主要产品来说，五年来为国家提供了：1、水轮机四十九台二十一万九千四百八十八瓩；2、交流发电机七十八万七千六百七十七瓩；3、交流电动机四百八十万零四百零八瓩；4、直流电机二十九万二千九百一十一瓩；5、变压器一千二百三十一万零二十三千伏安；6、高压断路器三万九千零五十九台；7、开关板十一万五千四百七十二面；8、电器仪表一百三十一万二千一百九十二只；9、裸铜线十一万七千六百五十六吨（仅电机部）；10、橡皮线二百零四万七千九百九十公里；11、电力电缆五万二千八百二十八公里；12、电讯电缆一万零四百五十七公里。这十二种主要产品以部属企业来看大多数已提前一年完成了五年计划，并且在五年期间可以完成一千八百种以上的新产品。以三个产品与历史上的最高年产量作比较：今年要生产发电机二十八万四千四百五十瓩，为一九四七年最高年产量二万零一百七十九瓩的十四点一倍；今年要生产电动机一百二十五万一千零七十三瓩，为一九四七年最高年产量五万一千零二十瓩的二十四点五倍；今年要生产变压器三百五十八万九千千伏安，为一九四二年最高年产量一万五千三百八十八千伏安的二十三点三倍。解放以前，五百瓩以上的发电设备，中型、大型的变电设备等全部从国外输入，但是现在我们能够制造：（一）成套供应一万二千瓩及以下的中、小型火力电站的电器设备；（二）成套供应一万五千瓩及以下的水力发电站的发电设备；（三）成套供应十一万伏及以下的电力系统的送电配电设备；（四）成套供应冶金部门的高炉、平炉、中小型轧钢设备所需要的电器传动设备；（五）可以供应煤炭和石油工业方面井下机械设备的电器传动设备及井上井下用的电机车；（六）能够供应机械工业所需要的配套电器设备和船用、国防用的部分电器设备；（七）能够供应轻工业如制糖、纺织等方面的电器设备。
    总之，第一个五年计划的成就是显著的，这些在解放以前是不可以想像的。为了配合我国社会主义工业建设发展的需要，我们还在着手准备试制一些大容量、高电压、精密的高级产品，如二万五千瓩及五万瓩的汽轮发电机，七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组，四千瓩的电动机，八十吨工矿用电机车，二十二万伏空气断路器，并着手研究二十二万伏六万三千千伏安的变压器，四十五吨以下的炼钢用电炉和三门峡水电站上所用的十万瓩以上的水力发电设备。
    铁路电气化已经为世界各国所积极采用，我国宝成铁路的秦岭段也是按电气化的标准设计的，坡度是千分之三十，而目前不得不用两台蒸汽机车来牵引，由于坡度大（蒸汽机车牵引，坡度不能超过千分之二十三），运输量受到了很大限制，下坡时一下闸（制动）摩擦出火，晚上看来像一条火龙，这样的干法不仅机车和铁轨的磨损很厉害，还有危险。如果改为电机车牵引，实行电气化以后，就可以解决这个问题。因此，我认为电机车的尽早试制和制造，对于发展我国山区和运输繁忙地区的交通运输事业的电气化有着重要的意义。希望国家能够抓紧这一工作。
    从电机制造工业的经济效果来说，劳动生产率已经提前近两年完成了五年计划，成本降低也提前一年完成了五年计划，目前电机产品的价格与国内外比较基本上是合理的，产品的质量大体上可以满足现时要求，同时在五年内除了税收和折旧外，还为国家上缴了七亿元以上的利润，而国家五年内向电机制造工业部门的投资才四亿八千九百元，这就是说，国家五年的投资，实际上在三年之内就通过上缴利润收回来了。在苏联和其他兄弟国家无私的援助下，帮助我国改建或扩建了不少电机制造厂，又新建了一批具有现代化水平的电机制造厂，在去年已经投入生产的有沈阳电缆厂、哈尔滨仪表厂，今年又有西安高压开关厂的水银整流器车间、西安电力电容器厂和哈尔滨电刷厂开始试生产。以上这些新型工厂的建成和投入生产，将为我国提供过去所不能生产的电机产品，成为电机制造工业部门中的骨干。总之，第一个五年计划的成就和这些骨干厂的建成，将为我国工业电气化所需要的电气设备奠定初步基础，同时通过现有的企业培养了一批新的企业管理干部和技术力量。事实表明社会主义国家间的互相支援结成的友谊是牢不可破的。
    以上这些铁一般的事实，都是全国劳动人民互相支援互相配合之下获得的，并充分地表现了计划经济的优越性，这是右派分子所不能否定的，也是抹煞不了的。
    去年十二月和今年四至六月我都在上海参加视察，重点是电机制造工业，在视察中证实了以上所说的事实。现在我要反映一下目前电机制造工业中所存在的几个缺点和问题：
    （一）产品的质量。随着电机工业的发展，品种多了，质量要求高了，产品的技术条件要求严格了，特别是新型的高级产品要求更高，然而生产上的不够正规，产品质量的不稳不高，都是目前电机工业生产上的关键问题，是前进道路上的主要障碍。有些开关设备操作不灵，绝缘不良，变压器渗油，电机温升高轴承发响等一系列的产品质量问题，还没有得到彻底解决，因之目前电机制造工业部各企业已将加强工艺、提高产品质量作为今年的中心工作，力求改进。
    （二）从电机制造工业的发展速度看来，是很快的，去年产值增长百分之六十五点五，今年的产值计划增长为百分之十六点三，在十三个工业部门里，是比较最高的。但是所生产的电机产品仍然大都是供不应求，以今年的计划产量来说，也不能满足需要，使需要部门感到紧张。要解决这一矛盾，必须增产电动机二十万瓩、变压器二十余万千伏安、直流电机五千瓩、电力电缆四百六十公里、电讯电缆二百五十公里、橡皮线一万公里，电磁线二百吨、高压开关板八百面等。这就说明国家对电机工业产品的需要是迫切的，应该注意使电机工业的发展步骤不致于落后于国家的需要。
    （三）电机制造工业是需要多方面的协助配合的，同时生产出来的电机产品又是供给工农业各部门及文教部门所需要的，现在制造的六千瓩及一万二千瓩的发电机所用的大轴（转子）及护环，矽钢片（包括热轧矽钢片和将来应该用的冷轧矽钢片），高级绝缘材料（包括玻璃丝、有机矽素、高强度漆和高级绝缘纸等），还有赖于进口。但是若能采取措施，这些大都可以在国内自己制造，只是因为批量小，要求高，可能影响制造部门的产值、成本和劳动生产率等指标，制造部门还未能积极试制和制造，我认为应该从国家整体利益着想，有关部门应该积极试制和生产，以支援电机工业的发展，保证整个工业所需要的电气设备，并节省外汇。
    （四）上海电机厂所生产的六千瓩的汽轮发电机，自一九五四年试制成功以后，已经可以大量生产了，到目前为止已经生产了二十五台，需要部门已经安装和正在进行安装的计有十八台，这就是说还有七台成品和半成品积压在工厂和销售部门，六千瓩的大轴和护环都是国外进口的，共订货六十二台，其他材料也有所准备，目前的问题是使用部门主要是电力部门不愿意用（特别是在生产出一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机以后），理由是放在大电力网内太小不经济，放在非电力网的一般电站上用又太大，实际上两台六千瓩并用也可以代替一台一万二千瓩，虽然多少要影响点厂房建筑面积的增加，但并不严重。这个问题说明使用部门和制造工业部门应从实际出发，互相协调，规定统一的计划和技术政策，希望国家对这个问题尽快的作出专案处理，积极加以安排。
    工业部门干部情况和青年知识分子的培养问题
    我在视察中接触到和看到的另一个问题，这就是工业部门的干部情况和青年知识分子的培养问题。
    解放以后，为了满足工业建设所需要的干部，国家曾经采取了有效的措施，诸如原来技职人员的留用、从工人中提拔、号召学过工业的归队、抽调干部转业、统一分配大专毕业生等等，这样基本上解决了工业部门和生产企业的急需，其中特别是青年知识分子占了不小的比重。他们在工作的实践学习中，有不少干部已经从外行变成了内行，技术水平和管理水平都有很大的提高，加之历年来大专毕业生源源不断的大量充实工业部门，因此，在工业部门特别是领导机关所需要的干部从数量上看来不像过去那样紧张了。
    八年来，在党和毛主席的无限关怀之下，我国一支新的青年知识界正在迅速地成长起来，从一九四九年到一九五六年全国高等学校的毕业生就有三十万二千人，在校的大学生还有四十四万三千人，可以说这支队伍已具有相当规模了，毛主席说的好：“我们的大学生，虽然还有许多人是非劳动人民家庭出身的子女，但是除了少数例外，都是爱国的，都是拥护社会主义的”。在已经毕业的大学生中，工业技术和工业经济专业的毕业生大约有十多万人走上了工业建设战线上的各个工作岗位，他们在党的具体培养下在向科学进军的热潮中和实际工作的锻炼中都有很大的进步。
    我非常同意毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中和周总理在“政府工作报告”中一再着重讲到的加强青年学生的思想政治教育和劳动教育的问题，这是目前青年学生中最迫切的工作，我们目前的任务就是要认真地积极地参加反击右派分子的斗争。为了贯彻劳动教育的精神，我认为大专学校毕业生的工作分配应加改进。毕业生所最关心的“学用一致”的问题基本上解决了，但到那里去“用”还是有些问题。近几年来，各部门在分配毕业生时，多把他们分配在领导机关和研究部门中工作，只有少数的下放到基层生产单位，这种情况一方面使企业需要得不到满足，另则使科学机关的导师负担过重，领导机关人员积压，本人工作无法开展，感到苦恼。因此，他们要求到基层生产部门去，愿走出温室去经受风霜锻炼自己，使理论和实际结合起来。事实上，劳动对于任何人都是有益的，学生参加一定时期的生产和体力劳动，不但可以学习许多知识，还可以改变对劳动人民的看法和感情，可以把体力劳动和脑力劳动的关系密切起来，这对于非劳动人民家庭出身的子女，特别是自从小学、中学、大学一直在学校生活了十多年又从未在生产单位中实际工作过的青年知识分子说来更有它特殊的意义。我认为这是很对的，建议有关部门逐步地满足他们的要求，让他们到基层生产单位去锻炼。当然，在具体安排的时候，由于专业与志愿以及企业所需要人员的口径问题，是会遇到一些困难的，但是只要各部门肯让他们到基层去，与他们讲清楚，这是会实现的。
    对于今年暑假大专毕业生的分配，除学校和研究机关留用少量的毕业生作助教、研究生和科学家的助手外，其余应让他们到基层去，学工的到工厂，学农的到农场或农业合作社。一般的应该让他们在实际工作中稳定地锻炼两年到五年，这是大有好处的，并使之逐渐形成国家的一种制度。前几年实行这个办法有困难，现在根据我前边所说的工业部门的干部情况，我认为是有条件的，是实行得通的。
    目前领导机关和科学研究部门想从基层抽调一些有经验的人来工作，非常困难，实行这个办法以后就可以改变现在的情况，有的厂长说如果贯彻这一精神，工厂是可以负责培养负责输送的。我认为领导机关和科学研究机关吸收具有一定实际工作经验的人工作或作科学研究，比留用刚毕业的学生会更好些。
    驳斥黄绍竑为反革命分子韩国屏“申冤”
    黄绍竑在今年三月十二日在政协会议上作为一个特别的例子指责了所谓河北省龙关县判处的一个案件，这就是反革命党团骨干分子韩国屏案件。黄绍竑的发言，登在三月十四日人民日报第三版的左上角上。他的发言的根据就是从去年七月起三番五次向他写信和找他反映情况的被告者的家属，并根据被告者家属反映的情况严厉指责龙关县法院判处韩国屏反革命分子八年徒刑，后经省法院改为教育释放，“如果不是遇到认真实行监督的高级法院的话，就会得不到国家宽大处理，或者是冤沉海底了”。
    请各位代表特别注意他的“冤沉海底”了这个结论。是否是冤沉海底了？我现在将韩国屏在解放前后破坏学生运动进行反革命活动的主要情况，介绍给各位代表分析。
    韩国屏，男，现年三十岁，学生成份，山西沁源县人。原在北京上学，后于一九四四年转到太原市工业学校学习并在该校参加国民党，担任区分部书记和区党部书记。在校内组织宣传队，并亲任队长在街头、电影院从事反共讲演，出版壁报，进行“统一中国就要灭共”等反动宣传。
    一九四七年韩国屏入辅仁大学历史系学习，不久即与该校特务分子邢连仲（邢系国际间谍雷振远、军统特务刁化仁所领导的匪“保密局公教青年救国团”及“华北剿总戡乱先锋队”地下工作第二队书记）、反动分子庞广善等勾结在一起，操纵反动分子和落后学生，打击和迫害进步同学，破坏学生运动。迫害我地下革命组织人员杨光烈、陆志芳、杨绍汉等人。有一天韩国屏等将杨光烈骗至他们的宿舍，在十几个反动分子的包围下，向杨光烈武力威胁，几乎动手，幸遇一常怀光同志想法将杨光烈拖走，才未遭意外。
    韩国屏经常混在同学中，监视进步同学的活动，对进步同学的书橱、书包进行秘密检查。辅大进步同学范光斗遭国民党逮捕后，杨光烈、陆志芳等掀起营救运动，班中同学写了营救信，韩国屏、邢连仲等曾两次向杨光烈追问写信人的姓名，致使杨、陆等人被迫离开北京。
    北京解放后，韩国屏于一九五○年四月到八月在北京大学文科研究所当练习生并兼任东单象鼻子中坑成人夜校教员时，阻挠青年参军入团，乘机散布反动言论，夜校学员王淑贤（女）要参加军事干部学校，韩国屏到王淑贤家中，伪装善良，利用王淑贤母痛女儿的心情，对王淑贤母亲说：“女孩子参军不好，工作地点又远……”，又对王淑贤说“你要考虑，别后悔，你妈向我要人我可不管，你妈上了吊怎么办？”就这样阻止了王淑贤参军。韩在夜校同学中造谣诬蔑说：“共产党巧使人，党团员是玩阴的（男女混杂的意思）。”韩国屏听到教师陈幼和要求入团的消息后，便对陈说：“你真不知道团的厉害，团是不许和非团员结婚的，入团以后可就不能自由啦。”班内女团员到街道团支部学习，韩对钱兰英同学说：“还不是一块胡闹。”
    韩在郊区借宣传抗美援朝的机会，对农民说：“你们看见了地主的下场，将来你们生活提高了也会掉下来的……”，破坏土地改革。
    根据他的这些反动表现，北京大学文科研究所和领导夜校的东单区文教科，于一九五一年八月和十月分别将韩国屏开除。
    一九五二年韩国屏到察南工农干部补习学校后，并不安心教学，继续进行破坏活动。韩的宿舍是住在老乡家里，他当着房东老太太撒尿，违反群众纪律，引起老乡反感，老乡当即向校方反映了他。此事引起广大师生的不满，全体师生联名告发了韩国屏。教育机关为了进一步帮助韩国屏转变，使他参加了一九五二年秋季教师思想改造的学习，并将他调离察南文化补习学校，分配到龙关县干部业余学校工作，一再等待其觉悟，但韩国屏到龙关后仍不老实，挑拨同事闹不团结，煽动学生向领导和政府对立，拉拢教员常元度说：“你要往我这边倒，让杨松年（教导主任）下台。”
    根据国家惩治反革命条例，韩国屏是反革命党团的骨干分子，是国民党区党部书记，不仅在解放前破坏学生运动，进行反革命运动，解放后韩国屏在过去的肃反运动中没有彻底交代自己的罪恶，仅交代了一般问题，隐瞒了主要情节，并坚持反动立场。在数年的教学过程中，仍不老老实实的承担人民教师的义务，经常散布反动言论，破坏革命工作。龙关县于一九五五年八月依法逮捕了他，经过深入教育和对破坏事实的多次查证，经过预审和公判调查，韩对全部破坏事实仍没有正确认识。对于这样的反革命分子，龙关县逮捕韩犯是正确的，也是应该判刑的。
    我要问黄绍竑，韩国屏这样的反革命分子受到人民政府的教育和应得的处分是“冤沉大海”了吗？请你不要一味的为反革命分子“申冤”，还是听听人民的意见吧！你的指责是没有根据的。我认为你不是人民的代表，而是代表反革命。人民不能允许你借着人民代表的身分，来包庇反革命分子。
    我们一定要继续贯彻“有反必肃、有错必纠”的方针，彻底粉碎右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋进攻，坚决在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下步向社会主义。
