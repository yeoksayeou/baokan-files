I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and I also fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Chief Procurator Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I suggest that the congress approve them.

Rightist Arguments are a Blatant Violation of the Constitution

Premier Zhou's report, based on Chairman Mao's guidelines on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," reviews the government's work over the past year and answers opinions raised on various aspects of the government's work. Therefore, it arrives at vivid and powerful conclusions in affirming achievements, examining shortcomings, and criticizing rightists. Affirming achievements uses concrete facts and precise figures to illustrate the tremendous achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and points out that "the victory of the five major movements guaranteed the smooth progress of the three major transformations" as the fundamental reason for the great development of industrial and agricultural production, further ensuring the continued development of our socialist cause. Examining shortcomings involves analyzing the subjective and objective causes of certain deviations and errors that have occurred in specific work, conducting inspections and making corrections, and pointing out that the rectification movement currently being carried out by the Chinese Communist Party is also a rectification movement in state organs, aimed at effectively overcoming bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We should adopt a welcoming attitude towards active criticism and consider and adopt beneficial suggestions to improve our work. Criticizing rightists involves using Chairman Mao's six criteria to point out the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of the fallacies spread by rightists about the government's various tasks, explaining that bourgeois rightists stand in opposition to socialism and even take actions that are detrimental to the socialist cause, and calling on everyone to draw a clear line with rightists politically and ideologically and wage a resolute struggle. All of this is a great encouragement and education for us.

The nationwide struggle against rightists currently underway demonstrates that the people of the country resolutely support the socialist-type constitution. In my speech at the first session of this congress, I said, "While the people of the country are rejoicing, they should also be cautious and fearful, and strengthen their vigilance. The fact that no one has raised objections to socialism does not mean that no one holds anti-socialist ideas. Because the vast majority of people are willing to move towards socialism, a very small number of people naturally dare not openly oppose socialism, but that does not mean they do not want to obstruct and sabotage it in secret. There will be many difficulties lying ahead of us, and we must rely on the powerful weapon of the constitution to overcome them." This time, rightists openly voiced various fallacies that violate the constitution, precisely because they had deeply ingrained capitalist ideas, misjudged the current domestic and international situation, and妄想to take advantage of the Party's rectification and the great blooming and contending, thus revealing their true colors from secret obstruction and sabotage. Of course, this cannot escape the discerning eyes of the people, and the people will never tolerate their conspiracies. I would like to take this opportunity to examine myself: Although I know that I should strengthen my vigilance, my vigilance is not strong enough, and I have not been able to thoroughly eliminate the old ideas lurking in my mind, nor have I been able to immediately identify certain seemingly reasonable fallacies of the rightists. I must better study Chairman Mao's speeches and Premier Zhou's report, better study Marxism, constantly educate myself, transform myself, draw a clear line with rightists, and unswervingly follow the Chinese Communist Party and take the socialist road.

Hope to Achieve Planned Parenthood Sooner

I would also like to talk again about the issue of planned childbearing. I talked about this issue at the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March of this year. Today, I do not have any more or newer ideas, so it seems unnecessary to talk about it again; however, in view of the situation in the past four months, the masses' demand for birth control and contraception has become even more urgent, and the phenomenon of excessively high population growth rates in various regions has become even more serious. Although the health departments have also carried out many birth control measures, they are far from being able to meet the actual needs of the masses. Therefore, I think it is beneficial to talk about this issue again. I will first repeat a few sentences I said last time: "At present, the promotion of birth control is easily accepted by the masses, but we have not done enough and need to vigorously develop it; contraceptive drugs are even more urgently needed by the masses, but we cannot universally and timely supply them, and need to massively manufacture and import a portion of them; the masses also demand simpler, more economical, and more effective oral contraceptives, but we cannot provide them, and need medical experts to actively research them." I said at the time, "These are arduous and complex tasks, but I believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the joint efforts of relevant departments, they can all be done well"; I now hold the same belief, but I feel that it should be done faster, and it seems to be progressing a little slowly at present. Achieving planned childbearing is better sooner rather than later. Reducing the currently excessively high population growth rate sooner will reduce the difficulties arising from contradictions among the people sooner.

Chairman Mao taught us to never forget that our country has 600 million people. If every young man and woman does not forget this point, it will be much easier to advocate late marriage and planned childbearing. On the basis of the original 600 million population, an excessively high population growth rate will add more difficulties. Since liberation, many factors have promoted the accelerated development of the population. Due to the more widespread medical and health facilities than before, the population mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and the birth rate has been greatly increased. It is said that the current natural population growth rate in our country has reached about 25 per thousand. Calculated on the basis of 600 million people, the average annual net increase is 15 million people. With productivity still relatively backward, and the population increasing so rapidly year after year, the contradictions that already exist among our people become more complicated. In terms of the education of the next generation, the government has built many nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools in recent years, but they are always unable to meet the demands. Vice Premier Bo Yibo said in his report: "There are still many school-age children who cannot enroll in school, and this is currently unavoidable. School-age children who cannot enroll can only enroll later." If the population birth rate is allowed to grow without any restrictions, the solution to this contradiction will be further delayed. Therefore, it is urgent to implement planned childbearing and not to delay it even slightly. Having fewer children and raising them well is a necessary understanding when we understand what Chairman Mao said: "Our country has a large population, which is a good thing, but of course there are also difficulties."

At this conference, Delegate Ma Yinchu put forward a "New Population Theory," which can also be said to be a population control theory. He explained from many aspects the necessity of controlling the population in our country. I basically agree with his opinions. Universally promoting contraception is the best and most effective way to promote planned parenthood. What else can be done? Mr. Ma once proposed the idea of "awarding those who have two children, taxing those who have three children, and heavily taxing those who have four children, and using the taxes collected as bonuses," but this was not written into the "New Population Theory" this time. I also received a letter from a comrade suggesting that the government should immediately announce: Starting from 1961, if anyone who already has three children gives birth to a fourth child, no more food will be allocated to this child. This comrade and Mr. Ma both advocate that each couple should limit their childbearing to two children, at most no more than three, and one is also good. The restriction methods they propose may be difficult to implement, but they can all reflect the masses' desire to control the population. I would like to introduce them here for everyone's research.

Birth Control Should Be Vigorously Promoted in Rural Areas

Finally, I would like to talk again about the issue of vigorously promoting birth control in rural areas. I have raised this issue twice at the first session of this congress and at the CPPCC meeting in March of this year. Delegate Hou Debang also said at the CPPCC meeting: "Birth control is of greater significance to rural areas." Recently, I saw Delegate Yu Huanzheng's report on his inspection of agricultural production in Zhejiang Province in the first half of this year, which said that since liberation, children have increased a lot and very quickly in rural areas in Jinhua and Wenzhou areas. After the birth control movement was launched, cities have seen its impact, but rural areas have no idea that this is happening. Mr. Yu visited a farmer's household and saw that the family only had one laborer and already had four children, and the mother was pregnant again, which was really suffering. If the population continues to increase so rapidly, it will be extremely difficult to improve the lives of farmers. This situation is definitely not limited to Jinhua and Wenzhou areas. It is really impossible to delay the promotion of birth control in rural areas any longer. The countryside is already organized, and the propaganda work is not too difficult to do. The supply and marketing cooperatives can be responsible for supplying medicines. I hope that leaders at all levels across the country will earnestly promote this, and include the promotion of birth control as an important item in rural work; people's representatives and CPPCC members should also include birth control work as an inspection item when they visit the countryside twice a year, and promote the benefits of birth control, contraception, and late marriage to farmers. I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, any difficulties can be overcome.

    谈同右派分子划清界限
    并再谈有计划地生育孩子问题
    邵力子的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，也完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的各项报告，建议大会予以通过。
    右派分子的谬论是公然违反宪法
    周总理的报告，是依据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”所提出的方针，检查一年来政府的工作，并且解答各方面对政府工作提出的意见，因而在肯定成绩、检讨缺点、批判右派三方面，都得出生动有力的结论。肯定成绩，是用具体事实和确切数字说明社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就，并指出“五大运动的胜利保证了三大改造能够顺利地进行”是工农业生产获得很大发展的根本原因，使我国社会主义事业的继续发展更加有了保证。检查缺点，是就具体工作上发生过的一些偏差和错误，分析主观的和客观的原因，进行检查和处理，并指出中国共产党正在进行着的整风运动，也就是在国家机关中的一次整风运动，目的是在于有效地克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，对于积极的批评，应该抱着欢迎的态度加以考虑，采纳其中有益的意见来改进工作。批判右派，是根据毛主席所指示的六条标准，就右派分子对政府各项工作所发的谬论，指出其中反党、反社会主义的实质，说明资产阶级右派分子是站在反对社会主义的立场上，甚至采取不利于社会主义事业的行动，号召大家必须在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，进行坚决的斗争。这都对我们有极大的鼓舞作用和教育意义。
    目前全国人民热烈地进行着的对右派分子的斗争，说明全国人民坚决拥护属于社会主义类型的宪法。我在本届大会第一次会议发言，曾说：“全国人民在欢欣鼓舞之中，还应戒慎恐惧，加强警惕。没有人提出反对社会主义的意见，并不等于没有人存在着反对社会主义的意识。由于极大多数人愿向社会主义迈进，极少数人自然不敢公开反对社会主义，但不能说他们不想在暗地里阻挠破坏。横在我们面前的将有不少困难，要依靠宪法这一有力的武器去克服它”。这次右派分子公开地发出种种违反宪法的谬论，正是由于他们早存着根深蒂固的资本主义意识，错估了当前的国内外形势，妄想钻帮助党整风和大鸣大放的空子，便从暗地里的阻挠破坏显出了原形，这当然逃不过人民雪亮的眼睛，人民是决不能容忍他们的阴谋的。我附带检讨自己：我虽知道应加强警惕，但是我的警惕性并不够强，对于潜伏在自己脑筋里的旧意识还未能彻底清除，对于右派分子某些似是而非的谬论还未能立即辨认。我必须更好地学习毛主席的讲话和周总理的报告，更好地学习马克思主义，不断教育自己，改造自己，同右派分子划清界限，坚定不移地跟着中国共产党，走社会主义的道路。
    希望更快地实现有计划的生育
    我还想再谈一谈有计划地生育孩子的问题。我在本年三月第二届政协全国委员会第三次会议上谈了这一问题，今天并没有更多更新的意见，似乎不必再谈；但有见于四个月来所得情况，群众对于节育避孕的要求越加迫切，各地方人口增殖率过高的现象越加严重，虽然卫生部门也已进行了不少的节育措施，还远远不能适应群众实际的需要。因此，我觉得再谈谈这个问题是有好处的。我先复说我前次说的几句话：“目前宣传节育已很容易为群众所接受，而我们做得还不够，有待于大力开展；避孕药物更是群众所迫切需要，而我们不能普遍地及时供应，有待于大量制造并进口一部分；群众还要求更简便更经济更有效的内服避孕药物，而我们还不能提供，有待于医药专家积极研究”。我当时说：“这些都是艰巨复杂的工作，但我相信在党和政府的正确领导下，由有关部门共同努力，都一定可以做好”；我现在更抱着同样的信念，但觉得要做得更快一些，目前似乎进行得稍慢。实现有计划的生育，是越快越好。把目前过高的人口增殖率早一点降低些，就能把人民内部矛盾所产生的困难早一点减少些。
    毛主席教导我们千万不要忘记我国有六亿人口这一点。如果每一个青年男女不忘记这一点，对于提倡迟婚，提倡有计划的生育，就容易得多。在原有六亿人口的基础上，人口增殖率过高是会增加更多困难的。解放以来，有很多因素促进人口的加速发展，由于医学卫生设备较前普遍，人口的死亡率大大降低，出生率大大提高，据说现在我国人口自然增加率已达到千分之二十五左右，以六亿人口计算，平均每年净增一千五百万人，生产力还相当落后，而人口这样年年激增，就使得我们人民内部原已存在的矛盾更加复杂。就下一代的教育讲，政府近年来兴办了很多的托儿所、幼儿园、小学、中学，而总是不能适应要求；薄一波副总理在报告里说：“现在还有许多学龄儿童不能入学，这在目前还不可能避免。不能入学的学龄儿童，只好晚一些入学”。如果再让人口出生率漫无限制地增长，这种矛盾的解决就更将延迟。所以急须实行有计划的生育，不可稍缓。把孩子生育得少些，教养得好些，这是我们体会毛主席所说“我国人多，是好事，当然也有困难”时必要的认识。
    这次会议中，马寅初代表提出了一篇“新人口论”，也可以说是人口控制论，他从多方面说明我国控制人口的必要，我基本上同意他的意见。普遍宣传避孕是推行计划生育最好最有效的办法。此外还可以做些什么呢？马先生曾提出过“两个孩子的有奖、三个孩子的要征税，四个孩子的要征重税，就以征来的税款作奖金”的主张，这次却未写入“新人口论”。我还接到一位同志来信，建议政府此时即宣布：自一九六一年起，凡已有三个孩子的人，再生第四个孩子，对这个孩子不再分配食粮。这位同志和马先生都主张每一对夫妇应限制生育两个孩子，至多不超过三个，一个也好。他们提出的限制办法，或者难于实施，但都可以反映群众对于控制人口的愿望，我特介绍出来，以供大家研究。
    农村应大力推行节育工作
    最后，我再谈农村应大力推行节育工作的问题，这是我在本届大会上一次会议和本年三月间政协会议两次提出过的。侯德榜委员也曾在政协会议说过：“节育对农村有更大意义”。最近看到俞寰澄代表本年上半年视察浙江省农业生产的报告，说金华温州两区农村解放以来，儿童增加得很多很快，节育运动展开后，城市已见影响，而农村绝不知有此事。俞先生访问一家农户，看到这家只有一个劳动力，小孩已有四个，母亲又复怀孕，真够受苦，照这样人口速增，要提高农民生活，是千难万难的。这种情况，决不止金华温州两区为然，对农村推行节育工作，实在不可再缓。农村已是有组织的，宣传工作并不太难做，供应药品则供销合作社可以担任。希望全国各级领导认真提倡，把宣传节育列入农村工作重要事项；人民代表、政协委员每年两次视察，如到农村，也把节育工作列入视察项目，并对农民宣传节育避孕和迟婚的好处。我相信在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，任何困难都是可以克服的。
