    Learn from Last Year's Lessons and Strengthen Typhoon Preparedness

    The typhoons appearing in the Western Pacific this year are slightly delayed compared to previous years. Around June 20th, the first typhoon center was discovered near Guam. This typhoon later passed west across the northeastern sea off Luzon Island, turned north to skirt Taiwan Province, then veered northeast and transformed into a temperate cyclone towards Japan. The maximum wind force near the center of the typhoon was above level 12 (40 meters per second). On the 25th, strong winds of level 7 to 10 appeared in the Taiwan Strait, and heavy rain occurred in Jiangsu Province and eastern Zhejiang. The eastern coast of Jiangsu even had torrential rain of more than 75 millimeters.
    On July 3rd, a tropical depression (weak typhoon) appeared in the South China Sea. Gale-force winds of about level 6 appeared in the northwestern part of the South China Sea. The center of this tropical depression began to weaken and disappear on the 5th. These situations indicate that this year's typhoons have arrived, and the first typhoon was already very strong. The second typhoon has already caused heavy rain in some areas, which is harmful to crops. These situations remind us to strengthen our preparedness for this year's typhoons.
    In the typhoon prevention work of 1956, there are several prominent lessons that should be remembered this year.
    First, give full play to the role of meteorological observatories. Do a good job of weather forecasting and warnings to avoid and reduce the losses from natural disasters. At present, the weather forecasts of meteorological observatories have been basically able to reach rural areas, pastoral areas, and fishing ports in many regions. This requires meteorological observatories to strive to improve the timeliness and accuracy of forecasts, and strengthen the work of heavy rain forecasts and typhoon warnings. On the other hand, Party and government organs in various regions should also maintain closer contact with meteorological departments this year, give full play to the role of meteorological observatories, and more effectively lead and organize the masses in the struggle against floods and typhoons, in order to strive for a bumper harvest this year.
    Second, do a good job in the inspection and preparation work for flood and typhoon prevention. In addition to timely inspection of embankment projects, careful and rotating inspections, and early repair of loose and weak embankment sections, proper relocation plans should also be made for dangerous buildings and flood storage areas. Attention should be paid to checking whether the material preparations for flood and typhoon prevention (including temporary safety warehouses and houses) are sufficient. This year, most regions have newly planted some crops or increased the area of continuous cropping and multiple cropping. The material preparations for flood and typhoon prevention may be different from previous years. Therefore, the experience of various regions in preventing or remedying various crops over the years should be referred to, and flood and typhoon prevention materials should be appropriately increased. At the same time, attention should be paid to checking the work of relevant departments in transmitting weather forecasts, requiring the establishment of a necessary duty system during the typhoon and flood prevention season, and clarifying the responsibilities of relevant personnel in transmitting forecasts, so as to avoid untimely transmission and affect the effect of disaster prevention.
    Third, do a good job in organizing on-site rescue work. When heavy rain and floods have occurred, and typhoons have appeared, relevant personnel should devote all their efforts to the fight against natural disasters. Responsible cadres must personally lead at dangerous embankment sections and on-site in order to accurately grasp the situation and make timely emergency measures, such as timely opening and closing culverts and sluice gates, and orderly transferring to the second line of defense when the weather is extremely dangerous and beyond human resistance. For large areas of crops, in addition to timely harvesting, attention should also be paid to storage. Some rice harvested in Anhui Province last year suffered great losses due to rain and water in the fields because no attention was paid to storage. Timely post-disaster work should also be carried out on crops that have been blown by the wind and flooded by water, such as draining waterlogged areas, supporting and cultivating roots, so as to minimize losses.
    Leaders at all levels should also retain a part of the mobile force in order to carry out emergency rescue in severely affected villages and communities in their own or neighboring regions, and reduce casualties and material losses. For individual locations where the weather is abnormally fierce and the defense force is weak, relevant departments above the prefectural committee should maintain close contact with meteorological departments, fully grasp the development of disastrous weather, and make preparations for emergencies in advance, so as to order the evacuation of personnel and rescue of materials as early as possible, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices and losses.
    For post-disaster relief work, such as supplying rations, medical care and epidemic prevention, and stabilizing order, loans, adjusting seeds, fertilizers, and other means of production required for restoring production, a comprehensive arrangement should be made so that the masses can suffer as little as possible from the disaster.

    今年台风季节推迟，但已出现的第一个台风风力很强，第二个台风使部分地区带来危害农作物的暴雨。因此，应该
    记取去年教训加强戒备台风
    王宪廷
    今年西太平洋出现的台风，较往年略为推迟。6月20日前后，始在关岛附近发现第一个台风中心，这个台风后来向西经过吕宋岛的东北海面，转北掠过我台湾省，再折向东北方变性为温带气旋去日本。台风的中心附近风力最大在十二级以上（每秒四十公尺），25日台湾海峡曾出现七至十级的大风，江苏全省和浙江东部出现了大雨，江苏东部沿海并有七十五公厘以上的暴雨。
    7月3日在南海出现一个热带低压（弱台风），南海西北部曾出现六级左右的大风，这个热带低压中心至5日始减弱消失。这些情况说明今年的台风已经到来，而且第一个台风的风力就很强。第二个台风，则已使部分地区出现危害庄稼的暴雨。这些情况，提醒我们要加强戒备今年的台风。
    1956年的防台风工作中，有几个较突出的教训在今年是应该记取的。
    第一，充分发挥气象台的作用。做好天气预报、警报，以避免和减轻天灾的损失。目前气象台的天气预报已在很多地区基本上能够传到农村、牧区和渔港，这就要求气象台努力提高预报的时效和准确度，加强暴雨预报、台风警报的工作；另一方面，各地党政机关今年也要更密切的与气象部门联系，充分发挥气象台的作用，并更有效地领导和组织群众防汛防台的斗争，以争取今年的大丰收。
    第二，作好防汛防台的检查与准备工作。除要对堤防工程进行及时检查，仔细而轮番的检查，发现松弱堤段早作修补外，对危险建筑、蓄洪区还应作出妥善的迁移计划。要注意检查防汛防台的物资准备（包括临时需要的安全仓库和房舍）是否充分。今年各地区大多新种一些作物或增加了连作、复种面积，所需要的防汛防台物资准备，可能与往年有些不同，因此，应参照历年各地对各种作物进行预防或补救的经验，适当地增设防汛防台物资。同时要注意检查有关部门传达天气预报的工作，要求在防台防汛季节建立必要的值班制度，并明确有关人员在传达预报中应负的责任，以免临时传递不及时，影响了防灾的效果。
    第三，作好现场抢救的组织工作。当暴雨、洪水已经发生，台风已经出现时，有关人员应以全力投入与天灾的斗争，在险要堤段和现场，必须有负责干部亲自领导，以便准确的掌握情况，及时作出应急措施，如及时开闭涵闸斗门，在天气十分险恶，已非人力所可抗御时有秩序地转移第二防线等。对于大面积的庄稼，除要及时抢割外，还要注意收藏，去年安徽省抢割的一些水稻，因未注意收藏，以致在田中雨淋水冲损失很大。对已受风吹水淹的庄稼，也要适时进行善后，如排除渍水，扶持、培根等，以尽量减轻损失。
    各级领导还应该保有一部分机动力量，以便对本地区或邻近地区的重灾村、社进行紧急抢救，减轻人员牺牲及物资损失。对于天气异常猛烈，而防守力量薄弱的个别地点，地委以上有关部门，应与气象部门密切联系，充分掌握灾害性天气的发展情况，事前作出万一的准备，以便及早下令撤走人员、抢出物资，避免无谓的牺牲和损失。
    对于灾后的善后工作，如供应口粮，医护防疫及安定秩序，贷款、调剂种子、肥料及其它恢复生产所需生产资料等，都要有一个统筹的安排，才能使群众尽量少受灾害的苦痛。
