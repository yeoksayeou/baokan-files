Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd, dispatch from New York by TASS: American "Patriot News" reporter Knight said in an article that the freedom that bourgeois propaganda organs loudly tout, especially freedom of speech, does not in fact exist in the United States. People are always talking about freedom of speech, but this "freedom" is merely a historical ornament.

Knight said: "People dare not speak their minds... People are afraid that their opinions will be known... They know what will happen if their opinions become known." The author pointed out that ordinary Americans are particularly afraid to talk about the Soviet Union or about communism, because people fear the so-called investigations (referring here to the extremely cruel "investigations" conducted by various committees in the United States, where those investigated are subject to fines, imprisonment, persecution, and other encounters).

    美一记者著文说
    美国没有言论自由
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约22日讯：美国“爱国者新闻报”记者奈特在一篇文章中说，资产阶级宣传机关大事吹嘘的自由，特别是言论自由，在美国事实上是不存在的。人们一直在谈论言论自由，但是，这种“自由”只不过是历史上的装饰品而已。
    奈特说：“人们不敢说出他们的心里话，……人们害怕他们的意见被人家知道。……他们知道，他们的意见被人知道后将产生什么结果。”作者指出，普遍的美国人特别害怕谈论苏联或者谈论共产主义，因为人民害怕所谓的调查（这里指的是，美国形形色色的委员会所进行的极端残酷的“调查”，被调查者会受到罚款、坐牢、迫害等遭遇）。
