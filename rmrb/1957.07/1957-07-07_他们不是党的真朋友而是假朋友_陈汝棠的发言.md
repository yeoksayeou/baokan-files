I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, and Vice Chairman Peng, especially Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report, which not only correctly summarized the great achievements and rich experience of our country’s socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past year, but also thoroughly shattered the various fallacies of the bourgeois right-wingers.

The democratic parties are friends of the Chinese Communist Party, and this friendship is based on a common political foundation. During the period of the people's democratic revolution, overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism was our common political proposition. In this revolutionary struggle, the Party and the democratic parties established a close relationship. During the period of socialist revolution, our common political proposition is to build our country into a great socialist country. The six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" are our common political foundation and the criteria for us to help and supervise each other. Without a common political foundation, one cannot be called a friend.

  The Communist Party has always treated friends with sincerity

I have been a friend of the Communist Party for more than twenty years, and I deeply feel the greatness of the Party. The Party treats friends with sincerity and cherishes them extremely. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, comrades from the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China often held meetings in my home. The Party did not avoid me, but trusted me. The Party also often advised me not to be too conspicuous, not to get too excited about things, and even directly criticized me for not being too left-leaning. Communist Party members were always afraid of implicating me and were reluctant to let me do more dangerous things. Once, the Party learned that the Kuomintang reactionaries were planning to assassinate me and helped me escape under very difficult circumstances. Communist Party members cared more about the safety of their friends than they did about their own. The Party always went to the greatest lengths to treat the mistakes of its friends with benevolence and righteousness. The Party was modest, open to good advice, and willing to help its friends with the attitude of being kind to people. The Party never abandons friends who, although they have made great mistakes, are still willing to work with the Party for the revolution. Some people, although they have cursed the Party, opposed the Party, and even seriously harmed the Party, but later became aware of their mistakes, or for other reasons, are willing to carry out revolutionary work with the Party on a common political basis. For the sake of the people's cause, the Party still makes friends with them.

The Party led the people of the whole country, united and united its friends, and after twenty-eight years of arduous struggle, at an inestimable cost, finally won the victory of China's democratic revolution. History is unforgiving, and history has tested the Party's friends. During these twenty-eight years of hardship, the Party had many loyal friends, some wavering friends, and some false friends. Thirty years ago, the Kuomintang right-wing took advantage of the Party's unpreparedness, betrayed the revolution, and carried out a counter-revolutionary massacre, and the blood of communists flowed everywhere. Later, some "friends" left the Party, betrayed the revolution, and became sinners of the motherland and the people. History proves that these people are false friends of the Party and enemies of the people.

  True friends share weal and woe, and fight alongside the Communist Party

The Party has many loyal and reliable friends, and they are the Party's confidants. These friends share weal and woe, and fight alongside the Party. Under the tempering of the revolution and the help of the Party, many people have become strong people's fighters. Lu Xun will always be our example. Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu are such friends, and Tao Xingzhi is also such a friend. In 1941, Tao Xingzhi and I were both in the Guangdong Dongjiang Column, where we slept in the same bed and talked heart to heart. At that time, we were both nearly fifty years old. Once, Tao Xingzhi asked me if I was a Communist Party member, and I said no. I asked him if he was, and he also replied no. I said that we are both very old, and as long as we are wholeheartedly fighting for the cause of the Party and the people, the Party and the people will understand us. Tao Xingzhi said that he realized the truth late, but he still had the second half of his life to devote to the cause of communism. He said that he was prepared to ask the Party to examine his life at the time of his death, and wished the Party to posthumously recognize him as a Communist Party member after his death. Tao Xingzhi did what he said, and Tao Xingzhi has already left this world, and Tao Xingzhi has also realized his great ambition. There are also many such friends sitting in this venue. I think that in Guangdong, Peng Zemin and Li Zhangda are also such friends of the Party.

  False friends are insincere and harbor ulterior motives

Among the Party's friends, in my opinion, there are still a few friends who are very unhelpful. These people do not really want to do something for the country and the people, but harbor ambitions and play old politicians' tricks to achieve their own ulterior motives. They are friends of the Party when it is beneficial to them, and they are not friends of the Party when things do not go their way; they are friends of the Party on the surface, but secretly sabotage the Party; they support the Party and socialism in words, but in reality, they oppose the Party and socialism, and they stop being friends of the Party as soon as they see an opportunity to exploit. These people not only lack the demeanor of a politician, but also betray the Chinese people's moral code. Zhang Bojun and others are like this. In 1948, Zhang Bojun and others engaged in armed activities in South China, wanting to divide the world into three parts with the Chinese Communist Party and Chiang Kai-shek, standing on equal footing. Zhang Bojun also introduced Liao Wenyi, the president of the disgusting Taiwan Provisional Government, to the democratic parties in an attempt to promote the trusteeship of Taiwan. In the struggle against the bourgeois right-wingers, many comrades exposed the past political speculative behavior of this group of people. We members of the democratic parties are familiar with their past behavior. Historical facts are still fresh in our memory, and everyone will not forget them.

After liberation, I felt that the Party was really great, not bearing grudges from the past, and never forgetting to give credit for even the smallest good deeds done for the people. The Party united a broad range of non-Party people to participate in government work and gave them very high political status. In the beginning, my thinking was not very clear. Sometimes I would say to my old Communist friends, "Your stomachs are really big, you can hold anything." Those Communist Party members always said to me, "The situation has changed now. Friends who have made mistakes in the past can correct them in the future, and besides, they have also done some good things for the people. Our country is so big, we must unite all the forces that can be united to build it together." I was very moved. I thought that some people have ambitions, and now that their political status is very high, under the influence of the Party's call and the rapid progress of the motherland's construction, they can be corrected. Therefore, I did not mention anything about the past and was willing to work together under the leadership of the Party to build a socialist motherland.

  False friends used the rectification movement to attack the Party

  Inciting the masses to oppose the Party and socialism

My mood has been very agitated these past two months. The Party sincerely and selflessly asked non-Party people to help the Party in the rectification movement, but the right-wingers took the opportunity to oppose the Party. I work in Guangdong. Before coming to Beijing to attend this meeting, I heard and saw in the newspapers many criticisms of the Party by non-Party people. Many opinions were well-intentioned, but at the same time, some anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies also appeared. Later, I felt that there was a countercurrent, and the right-wingers were very arrogant, spreading anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies everywhere. Why is this? Is this to help the Party? Many upright people were very angry about this situation. As far as I know, the Guangdong Nanfang Daily received many protest letters from workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Forty-seven workers jointly wrote a letter to Nanfang Daily, asking why Nanfang Daily only published bourgeois remarks and not the words of workers and peasants, and whether it no longer represented them. The workers said in the letter, "It is impossible without the leadership of the Communist Party. It is impossible to withdraw the public representatives from the joint state-private enterprises. If you do not publish our letters, we will go to the newspaper office and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party to petition." At that time, I was also very angry, and my blood pressure was also high. I felt that I had to speak out. I published an article in Nanfang Daily entitled "The Problem Lies in Seeking Truth from Facts and Distinguishing Right from Wrong," refuting those anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies that reversed black and white and confused right and wrong. But at that time, I did not fully realize the conspiracy of the right-wingers. A few days later, the nationwide struggle against the right-wingers began, and people exposed the right-wingers' use of the opportunity to help the Party in the rectification movement to spread reactionary remarks, attempting to undermine the socialist cause, undermine the people's democratic dictatorship, undermine the relationship between the Party and the masses, and usurp the Party's leadership. Their conspiratorial and criminal activities were organized, planned, programmed, and had a route. Only then did I realize more clearly that the right-wingers, when the Party asked friends to help themselves in the rectification movement, suddenly struck the Party on the head with a stick, attempting to give the Party a surprise blow; and fanned the flames of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment among the masses, attempting to create chaos in order to take advantage of the fire. This is how the right-wingers helped their friends. However, the Communist Party is wise, and the eyes of the majority of members of the democratic parties and the broad masses of the people are discerning. The situation now is very different from thirty years ago. What was the result? As the People's Daily editorial pointed out, "The people who attacked socialism discovered that it was not the Communist Party that was surrounded by the masses, but themselves."

  We will never cease fighting until we completely shatter the bourgeois restoration conspiracy

Now, the bourgeois right-wingers want to call it quits in the face of the overwhelming anti-right-wing struggle of the masses. I think that this battle was provoked by the right-wingers. This is a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. We must completely shatter the capitalist restoration conspiracy. Unless they thoroughly repent, honestly confess, and thoroughly correct their mistakes, the battle must be fought to the end, and they must not be allowed to muddle through.

The right-wingers are trying to make people believe that the country's construction in the past eight years has been a mess, that there have been deviations in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, that the Party's bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism have been serious to the point of being incurable, and that Communist Party members are all incompetent people. They use the phrase "Communist Party members are made of special materials" to satirize Communists. They have come to the conclusion that the people's democratic dictatorship is unacceptable, that socialism is unacceptable, that they want to "settle accounts" with the Communist Party, that they want to "take revenge for grievances and pay back for debts," that the Communist Party cannot lead any longer, that it must step down, or at least divide the spoils equally and hand over half of the leadership. We members of the democratic parties, as long as we are not ambitious people, as long as we do not harbor hatred towards the people and the Party, will know that the Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction has been concluded by history and is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. Do the great achievements of the motherland in the past eight years not already prove that only the leadership of the Communist Party can create such miracles? Which other party has such ability? Regarding the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the reports of Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng and President Dong Biwu are a solemn answer to those who are clamoring for counter-revolutionaries. I believe that the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is completely correct. If it were not for mobilizing the masses and vigorously launching the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people's lives and property would not be guaranteed, social order could not be maintained, the people's regime could not be consolidated, and the great victory of socialist transformation and construction would not be possible. The Party has always adopted a policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionaries. In the past two years, due to changes in the situation, the Party has adopted a more lenient policy towards counter-revolutionaries, and many historical counter-revolutionaries have been placed in employment. At the same time, the Party has exhausted all means to implement "errors must be corrected" and to "not wrong a single good person." But how did the counter-revolutionaries treat the Communist Party members and revolutionary masses in the past? Just to say that in Guangdong during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, from Guangzhou to Hailufeng, from the Pearl River, the East River to Hainan, was not the land and river water dyed red with blood? Some people say they want to settle accounts. I think it can be settled. Who owes whom blood debts and who owes whom money debts? Is it necessary for the masses to rise up and settle all the old accounts clearly? If the bourgeois right-wingers are not too delirious and can calmly think about the accounts between themselves and the workers and peasants, I think they should "repay kindness with kindness" to the Party and the people.

There have been shortcomings and errors in the work of the past eight years. It is impossible to imagine carrying out such a great cause without some shortcomings and errors. The Party's rectification movement shows that only the proletarian party has such great courage to dare to expose its own shortcomings and errors and overcome them. Although many Communist Party members have been infected with bad or even atrocious work styles, the vast majority of Party members are diligent, dedicated, and serve the people day and night. Not to mention that in the revolutionary wars of more than twenty years, Communist Party members walked through grasslands, crossed snow-capped mountains, and bravely sacrificed themselves one after another. Just when the right-wingers were smiling sinisterly and satirizing Communist Party members as being made of special materials, in our Guangdong, nine Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members sacrificed their lives in the struggle against floods in order to save the lives and property of the people. May I ask you ambitious people, what materials are you made of, who are unfaithful, unrighteous, and wholeheartedly want to engage in capitalist restoration?

The conspiratorial and criminal activities of the bourgeois right-wingers show whether they are true friends or false friends of the Party!

The times are advancing, history is unforgiving, and history will continue to test the Party's friends. May the Party's friends closely follow the Party, jointly improve their political consciousness, strive to be the Party's loyal and reliable friends, clearly draw a line between themselves and the right-wingers, and resolutely fight against the right-wingers. If some friends have made mistakes, as long as they thoroughly repent and earnestly correct them, the Party will still help us. Do not be false friends of the Party. If you are insincere, backstabbing, harboring ulterior motives, ambitious, and unrepentant until death, history has proven that it is not the Party and the people who will be destroyed, but themselves.

### 他们不是党的真朋友而是假朋友  陈汝棠的发言

专栏：

    他们不是党的真朋友而是假朋友
    陈汝棠的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李、薄副总理、彭副委员长的报告，特别是周总理的政府工作报告，不但正确地总结了我国一年来社会主义革命与社会主义建设事业的伟大成就和丰富经验，同时也彻底粉碎了资产阶级右派分子的各种谬论。
    民主党派是中国共产党的朋友，这种朋友关系是建立在共同的政治基础之上的。在人民民主革命时期，打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，是我们共同的政治主张。在这一革命斗争中，党与民主党派建立了亲密的关系。社会主义革命时期，我们共同的政治主张是要把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中所提出的六条标准，是我们共同的政治基础，是我们进行互相帮助和互相监督的准则。离开了共同的政治基础，就不能说是朋友了。
  共产党对待朋友一向是推心置腹
    我做共产党的朋友有二十多年了，我深深感觉到党的伟大。党对待朋友是推心置腹的，是极其爱护的。抗战初期，中共广东省委的同志常在我家里开会，党是不避我的，是信任我的。党还常常劝告我，不要太露面，遇事不要太激动，甚至直接批评我不要有过左的表现。党员同志总是怕连累我，较危险的事不肯让我去做。有一次党得知国民党反动派要暗害我，在十分困难的情况下助我出走。党员同志关心朋友的安全，胜过对于自己。党对朋友的过错总是做到仁至义尽的，党对朋友是虚怀若谷，从善如流的。党也是坚持真理，以与人为善的态度帮助朋友的。党从不舍弃那些虽有很大过错，但仍愿和党一起进行革命工作的朋友。有的人，虽然谩骂过党，反对过党，甚至严重危害过党，但是后来觉悟了，或是为了其他原因，愿意与党在共同的政治基础上进行革命工作，党为了人民事业，也仍然和他们做朋友。
    党领导了全国人民，团结和联合了自己的朋友，经过了二十八年的艰苦战斗，付出了无可估量的代价，终于取得了我国民主革命的胜利。历史是不留情的，历史考验了党的朋友。在这二十八年艰难困苦的日子里，党有很多忠实的朋友，有过一些较动摇的朋友，也有过一些假朋友。三十年前，国民党右派趁党不备，叛变革命，实行反革命大屠杀，共产党人流血遍野。以后，又有些“朋友”离开了党，背叛了革命，成为祖国和人民的罪人。历史证明，这些人是党的假朋友，是人民的敌人。
      真朋友与共产党共患难、共甘苦、共战斗
    党有很多忠实的可靠的朋友，他们是党的知交。这些朋友与党共患难、共甘苦、共战斗。在革命的锻炼和党的帮助下，很多人成为坚强的人民战士。鲁迅，永远是我们的榜样。闻一多、李公朴是这样的朋友，韬奋也是这样的朋友。一九四一年，我和韬奋都在广东东江纵队，我们同床而眠，促膝而谈。那时我们都是近五十的人了。有一次韬奋问我是不是共产党员，我说不是。我问他是不是，他也答不是。我说我们年纪都很大了，只要我们忠心耿耿为党和人民的事业而奋斗，党和人民会了解我们的。韬奋说他自己认识到真理晚了些，但还有后半生可以献身于共产主义事业。他说他准备在临终的时候，要求党考察自己的一生，愿党在他死后能够追认他为共产党员。韬奋按照他自己的话做了，韬奋已经离开了人间，韬奋也已实现了他的宏愿。在我们这个会场上，也坐着不少这样的朋友。我认为，在广东，彭泽民和李章达也是党的这样的朋友。
      假朋友口是心非别抱野心
    在党的朋友中，在我看来，也还有少数很不够朋友的朋友。这些人不是真正想为国家为人民做些事情，而是抱有野心，玩弄旧政客的手腕来达到个人不可告人的目的。他们在对自己有利的时候，就做党的朋友，稍不如愿就不做党的朋友；表面上做党的朋友，暗中拆党的台；口头上拥护党、拥护社会主义，实际上反党、反社会主义，一看到有空子可钻，就不做党的朋友。这些人不仅缺乏一个政治家的风度，而且有背中国人为人的道德。章伯钧等人就是这样的。一九四八年章伯钧等人在华南搞武装，想与中共、蒋介石三分天下，鼎足而立。章伯钧还介绍过那个提起令人作呕的台湾临时政府总统廖文毅与民主党派拉关系，企图搞台湾托管的活动。在反资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，很多同志都揭露了这伙人过去的政治投机行为。我们民主党派的人，对他们过去的为人都是熟悉的。历史事实，记忆犹新，大家是不会忘记的。
    解放以后，我感到党真是伟大，毫不念旧恶，而只要对人民做过一点好事，都不漏账。党团结了广大党外人士，参加政府工作，并且给予很高的政治地位。开始，我的思想是不很通的，有时在党员老朋友面前说：“你们的肚子可真大，什么都装得下”。那些党员同志总是对我说：“现在形势改变了，过去有过错误的朋友，今后是可以改正的，再说他们也对人民做过些好事。我们的国家这么大，要团结一切可以团结的力量来共同建设”。我很受感动。我想，有一些人有野心，现在政治地位很高了，在党的感召下，在祖国建设事业一日千里地前进的影响下，是可以改正的。于是对于过去的事，也一概不提了，愿大家共同在党的领导下建设社会主义祖国。
    假朋友利用整风向党打闷棍
    煽动群众反党反社会主义
    这两个月来，我的心情是很激动的。党诚心诚意、大公无私地要求党外人士帮助党整风，但是右派分子却乘机反党。我在广东工作，在未来北京参加这次会议前，听到和在报上看到许多党外人士对党的批评。很多意见都是善意的，同时也出现了一些反党、反社会主义的谬论。后来感到有股逆流，右派分子很嚣张，到处散布反党、反社会主义谬论。这是为什么呢？这是为了帮助党吗？对于这种情况，很多正直的人都很气愤。据我所知，广东南方日报就接到很多来自工人、农民、知识分子的抗议信。有四十七个工人联名写信给南方日报，问南方日报为何只登些资产阶级的言论，不登工人、农民的话，是不是现在不代表我们了。工人们在信中说：“不要共产党领导是不行的，要公方代表撤出公私合营企业是不行的，如果再不登我们的信，我们就要到报社和中共省委去请愿了”。当时我也很气愤，我的血压也高了，感到不能不说话。我在南方日报发表了“问题在于实事求是，分清是非”的文章，批驳那些颠倒黑白、混淆是非的反党、反社会主义谬论。但我当时还没有完全认识到右派分子的阴谋。过了几天，全国人民反右派斗争展开了，纷纷揭露右派分子利用帮助党整风的机会，散布反动言论，企图破坏社会主义事业、破坏人民民主专政、破坏党和人民群众的关系、篡夺党的领导权。他们的阴谋罪恶活动，是有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线的。这时我才更清楚地认识到，原来那些右派分子，当党要求朋友帮助自己整风的时候，他们一手执棍，冷不防地向党的头上打来，企图给党一个闷棍；一手执扇，向群众煽动反党、反社会主义的火焰，企图造成混乱，以便趁火打劫。右派分子就是这样来帮助朋友的。但是，共产党是英明的，民主党派的大多数成员和广大人民群众的眼睛是雪亮的，现在和三十年前已经大不相同了。结果如何呢？正如人民日报的社论指出：“向社会主义进攻的人们发现，被群众包围的并不是共产党，而是他们自己”。
  不彻底粉碎资产阶级复辟阴谋决不收兵
    现在，资产阶级右派分子在人民群众声势浩大的反右派斗争面前，想要收兵了。我认为，这一场战斗是右派分子挑起的，这是一场社会主义道路与资本主义道路的路线斗争。我们必须彻底粉碎资本主义的复辟阴谋。除非他们彻底悔悟、老实交代、痛改前非，否则，战斗必须进行到底，不准他们蒙混过关。
    右派分子企图使人们相信，八年来国家的建设事业搞得一团糟，肃反运动出了偏差，党的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义已经严重到无可救药的地步，共产党员尽是些无能之辈。他们用“共产党员是特殊材料制成的”这句话来讽刺共产党人。他们就此做出这样的结论：人民民主专政要不得，社会主义要不得，要向共产党“算账”，要“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”；共产党不能领导下去了，要下台，至少也要平分秋色，把领导权交出一半来。我们民主党派的成员，只要不是野心家，只要不是对人民、对党怀着仇恨，都会知道：共产党领导中国革命和社会主义建设，是经历史做了结论的，是宪法明文规定的。祖国八年来的巨大成就，难道不已经证明，只有共产党的领导，才能创造这样的奇迹吗？其他党派那一个有这样的本事呢？关于肃反问题，张鼎丞检察长和董必武院长的报告，是对于为反革命分子叫嚣的人一个严正的答复。我认为党的肃反政策是完全正确的，如果不是经过发动群众，大张旗鼓地展开镇压反革命运动，人民的生命财产就得不到保障，社会治安就无法维持，人民政权就无法巩固，社会主义改造和建设事业的伟大胜利就更谈不到。党对反革命分子是一向采取镇压与宽大相结合的政策的，近两年来，由于形势的改变，党对反革命分子采取了更加宽大的政策，很多历史反革命分子被安置就业。同时党又用尽一切办法实行“有错必纠”，做到“不冤枉一个好人”。而过去反革命分子是怎样对待共产党人和革命群众的呢？单说广东在第二次国内革命战争时期，从广州到海陆丰，从珠江、东江到海南，不是鲜血染红了土地和江水吗？有人说要算账，我认为是可以算的。究竟是谁欠下了谁的血债，谁欠下了谁的钱债？是不是要人民群众起来把一切陈年老账都算个一清二楚呢？如果资产阶级右派分子不是太热昏，而能冷静想一想自己与工农群众之间的账目，我看倒是应该向党和人民“有恩报恩”了。
    八年来的工作中是有缺点和错误的，不能设想进行这样伟大的事业而不发生这样和那样的一些缺点和错误的。党的整风运动表明只有无产阶级的政党才有这样大的气魄敢于揭露自己的缺点和错误，并予以克服。虽然有不少共产党员沾染了不良的甚至恶劣的作风，但绝大部分党员都是勤勤恳恳、全心全意、夜以继日地为人民服务的。且不说二十多年的革命战争中，共产党人走草地、过雪山，前仆后继，英勇牺牲，就是正当右派分子怀着阴笑，讽刺共产党人是特殊材料制成的那个时候，在我们广东，有九位共产党员和共青团员，为了抢救人民的生命财产，在与洪水搏斗中献出了自己的生命。请问野心家们，你们背信弃义，一心想搞资本主义复辟，究竟是什么材料制成的呢？
    资产阶级右派分子的阴谋罪恶活动，表明了他们是党的真朋友还是假朋友！
    时代在前进，历史是不留情的，历史将继续考验党的朋友。愿党的朋友们紧紧地跟着党前进，共同来提高自己的政治觉悟，力争做党的忠实的可靠的朋友，明确地与右派分子划清界限，坚决与右派分子进行斗争。如果有的朋友犯了错误，只要彻底悔悟，切实改正，党还是会帮助我们的。千万不要做党的假朋友，如果口是心非，口蜜腹剑，心怀贰志，野心勃勃，而又至死不悟，历史已经证明，毁灭的不是党和人民，而正是他们自己。
