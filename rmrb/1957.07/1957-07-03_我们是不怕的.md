We are not afraid. Having weathered so many dark and stormy years, having endured so many curses, lashes, and impacts, we are strong, we are the strongest. Is there any higher right to pride in my life than this? So, get out of the way, right-wingers! Yesterday, you were polite and bowing, yet gnashing your teeth. Today, you charge on horseback, hacking and slashing. Beware! You will be crushed! We are not afraid, we are absolutely not afraid. Together with the sun, since our Party was able to come from yesterday, how could it not go towards tomorrow?

    我们是不怕的穿过多少风雨如晦的年月，忍受过多少诅咒、鞭打、冲击，但我们是坚强的，我们是最坚强的，难道在我的生活中还有比这更高的骄傲的权利？那么，滚开吧，右派分子！昨天，你彬彬有礼地一面鞠着躬一面又咬牙切齿，今天，你又骑马冲来，连砍带劈。留心！你将粉碎！我们是不怕的，我们是绝对不怕的。和太阳一起，我们的党既然能够从昨天走来，岂不能朝明天走去？
