Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 13th: According to TASS, at a banquet held in Prague on July 11th to welcome the Soviet Party and Government delegation, Czechoslovak President Sapotocky and First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Khrushchev both spoke. They both focused on the peaceful coexistence of countries with two different social systems.

Sapotocky said: The fact that the Soviet Union, the center of the international workers' movement led by the glorious Communist Party, has simultaneously become the leading force in the struggle for world peace and the struggle for peaceful coexistence among all countries is not accidental but entirely in line with the laws of history. We support this policy of the Soviet Union.

Sapotocky said at the banquet that in Czechoslovakia, building a new society in the current historical stage is inextricably linked to the issue of peace. What is meant here is the peaceful coexistence of two different systems in mutual competition. This is a struggle carried out by peaceful means. We are convinced that all honest people, regardless of their political beliefs, religious beliefs, or ethnicity, will agree with this form of struggle, because they want to work honestly and live off the fruits of their labor, and they are irreconcilably opposed to all imperialist, revanchist, and aggressive aims.

In his speech, Sapotocky also emphasized the historical significance of the recent plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee. He said that this plenary session implemented the line established by the 20th Congress, thoroughly eliminating everything that could undermine party unity and hinder the smooth implementation of the line of the 20th Congress.

Khrushchev then said that the people yearn for peace most of all. The issue of war and peace stirs everyone, so we are doing our best to fight for peace. The entire socialist camp is resolutely striving for peace and for the establishment of good relations between countries. We should develop friendly relations between all countries, and first of all strengthen the relations between socialist countries, between our communist and workers' parties, and strengthen our socialist camp with all our might. It is true that our Yugoslav friends are not very comfortable saying the term "socialist camp." But Yugoslavia is a socialist country, and there is no need to shy away from saying this. No matter what words you use to express it, to form a broad front and advance, to build socialism victoriously, we must strengthen the unity of socialist countries and enrich their revolutionary strength.

Khrushchev said that we are willing to strengthen friendly ties with all countries. And precisely because of this, we want to strengthen the socialist camp and enrich the forces that are conducive to strengthening the cause of peace. We have no other purpose.

He continued by saying that we hope to establish friendly relations with capitalist countries, such as the United States. This country is a powerful country. But we are not weak either. Then let's compete! We also hope to establish friendly relations with Britain, France, Italy, and other capitalist countries. War will bring nothing but tears, destruction, and the destruction of the wealth created by human labor.

Khrushchev said that not only our country, but all the countries of the socialist camp are fighting for peace. The people of other countries are also fighting for peace. This is the only correct path. No matter what difficulties there are on this road, we should tirelessly mobilize the people and cultivate the forces for peace. The forces of peace will continue to grow, while the forces serving war will shrink. Human reason must prevail! Our socialist countries were not born under the chimes of bells, but under the gunfire of the "Aurora." All new things are born in suffering.

He said that we have always said to the representatives of capitalist countries, let us compete, let us coexist peacefully, even if not for love, but out of necessity, we must coexist, because capitalist countries and socialist countries are on the same planet. Let us compete in a peaceful competition. But don't compete like buffaloes, who want to stab each other to death with their horns, but we must use our peaceful development to prove which system is better, which system allows for greater development of the entire productive forces of society, is it the socialist system or the capitalist system. It often happens that two people do not marry out of love, but later live together for a lifetime. Let's try it this way, living together peacefully on one planet.

    萨波托斯基、赫鲁晓夫强调和平共处
    两个制度应在和平竞赛中见高低
    社会主义国家愿同资本主义国家建立友好关系
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社布拉格讯：在7月11日在布拉格为欢迎苏联党和政府代表团而举行的宴会上，捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基和苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫都讲了话。他们都着重谈到了两种社会制度的国家和平共处的问题。
    萨波托斯基说：以光荣的共产党为首的国际工人运动中心苏联同时成为争取世界和平的斗争和争取各国人民和平共处的斗争的领导力量这个事实，不是偶然的，而是完全合乎规律的。我们支持苏联这种政策。
    萨波托斯基在宴会上说，在我们捷克斯洛伐克，在当前的历史阶段内建成新社会的问题同和平问题是不可分割地联系在一起的。这里所指的是两种不同的制度在互相竞赛中的和平共处问题。这是用和平手段进行的斗争。我们确信，所有忠实的人，不管他们的政治信仰、宗教信仰和种族如何，都一定会同意这种斗争形式的，因为他们希望忠实地工作，并且依靠自己的劳动果实来生活，他们同一切帝国主义、复仇主义和侵略的目的是势不两立的。
    萨波托斯基在讲话中还强调指出苏共中央最近一次的全体会议所具有的历史性的意义。他说，这次全体会议实现了第二十次代表大会所规定的路线，彻底地清除了一切可能破坏党的团结和阻碍顺利地贯彻第二十次代表大会的路线的东西。
    赫鲁晓夫随后说，人民最渴望的是和平。战争和和平的问题激动着每一个人，因此我们在尽全力为和平而斗争。整个社会主义阵营都在坚决争取和平，争取各国之间建立良好的关系。我们应当发展各国之间的友好关系，首先要加强社会主义国家之间、我们各国共产党和工人党之间的关系，全力加强我们的社会主义阵营。不错，我们的南斯拉夫朋友对“社会主义阵营”这个名词不大说得出口。但是南斯拉夫是社会主义国家，这是毋庸讳言的。不管你用什么话来表达，但是要结成广泛的阵线前进，要胜利地建设社会主义，我们就得加强社会主义国家的团结，充实它们的革命力量。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们愿意同一切国家加强友好联系。而正因为如此，我们要加强社会主义阵营，充实有利于加强和平事业的力量。我们没有其他目的。
    他接着说，我们希望同资本主义国家，例如同美国也建立友好关系。这个国家是一个强大的国家。但是我们也不是弱者。那末我们就来竞赛吧！我们也希望同英国、法国、意大利和其他资本主义国家建立友好关系。战争不会带来任何东西，只会带来眼泪、破坏、消灭人的劳动所创造的财富。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不仅是我们的国家，而且所有的社会主义阵营国家也都在为和平而斗争。其他国家的人民也都在为和平而斗争。这是唯一正确的道路。不管这条道路上有什么困难，我们应当不倦地动员人民，培植争取和平的力量。和平力量将不断增长，而为战争效劳的力量将日益缩小。人的理智必然战胜！我们社会主义国家不是在钟声下诞生的，而是在“阿芙乐尔号”的炮声下诞生的。一切新生事物都是在苦难中诞生的。
    他说，我们过去和现在一直都对资本主义国家的代表说，让我们来竞赛，让我们和平共处，即使不是为了爱，而是出于必要，我们也必须共处，因为资本主义国家和社会主义国家都在一个行星之上。让我们在和平竞赛中较量。不过不要像水牛那样较量，水牛是想用自己的角戳死对方的，而我们却要用自己的和平发展证明，什么样的制度更好，什么样的制度让社会的全部生产力有更大的发展余地，是社会主义制度还是资本主义制度。常常有这样的情况：两个人不是由于爱情而结婚的，但后来却一辈子在一起生活。我们也这样试试看吧，住在一个行星上和平共处。
