    Cao Baolu is a Scum of the Quyi World

    (Report from our newspaper) The Beijing Quyi community held a symposium on the 23rd and 24th to criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of rightist Cao Baolu.

    Wei Changlin, Gu Rongfu, Liu Sichang and others revealed that Cao Baolu mobilized everyone to air grievances during the rectification campaign and was greatly dissatisfied with those who didn't speak out enough. Cao Baolu declared that he was determined to "speak out even if it was like a counter-revolutionary."

    After the death of Wang Zhenlu, an old quyi artist, the Chinese Quyi Research Association wrote a letter of condolence and sent 140 yuan, entrusting Cao Baolu to visit the family. However, Cao Baolu insidiously withheld the letter and deceived Wang's family, saying that the government did not care about them, and that this 140 yuan was temporarily borrowed from the Chinese Quyi Research Association through his efforts, attempting to provoke Wang's family's dissatisfaction with the government. He also distorted the facts, saying that the government regarded movie and drama actors as first-class citizens, Peking opera actors as second-class, Pingju opera actors as third-class, and quyi actors as fourth-class, attempting to incite more quyi artists to be dissatisfied with the government.

    After Cao Baolu attended the forum where the Agricultural and Democratic Party started fires in the opera circles, he spread rumors widely. He also said maliciously: "Before liberation, if someone beat us, we could still scold them a few times, but today, even if we are beaten, we dare not even scold."

    Many artists pointed out at the meeting that Cao Baolu had always oppressed his colleagues before liberation and was a 'batou' (chief) in the quyi world. After liberation, the Party did not hold him accountable for the past. He now serves as a representative of the Beijing People's Congress, a member of the CPPCC, a director of the Chinese Quyi Research Association, and the director of the Beijing Quyi and Acrobatics Workers Union, etc., but he still insisted that the Party did not "value" him, and slandered the Party for treating him like a thief. His various fallacies aroused the indignation of the artists present and were strongly refuted.

    曹宝禄是曲艺界的败类
    本报讯　北京曲艺界在23至24日召开座谈会，批判右派分子曹宝禄的反党、反社会主义言行。
    魏长林、顾荣甫、刘司昌等揭发曹宝禄发动大家在整风中诉苦，对鸣放得少的人大为不满。曹宝禄宣称他自己下定了“放到即使像反革命那样还要放”的决心。
    曲艺老艺人王贞禄逝世后，中国曲艺研究会写了一封致哀信和发一百四十元钱委托曹宝禄去向家属慰问。但曹宝禄阴险地扣下了信，欺骗王的家属说政府不管你们，这一百四十元是我设法向中国曲艺研究会暂借来的，企图挑起王的家属对政府的不满。他还歪曲说政府把电影话剧演员看作是第一等人，京剧演员是第二等，评剧演员是第三等，曲艺演员是第四等。企图煽起更多曲艺艺人对政府的不满。
    曹宝禄参加了农工民主党在戏曲界放火的座谈会后，回来大肆造谣。他还恶毒地说：“解放前有人打了我们，我们还能骂几句，今天我们挨了打连骂也不敢骂。”
    很多艺人在会上指出，曹宝禄在解放前一贯欺压同业，是曲艺界的把头。解放后，党对他不咎既往，他现在担任着北京市人民代表、政协委员、中国曲艺研究会理事、北京市曲艺杂技工作者联合会的主任委员等，但他还硬说党不“重视”他，诬蔑党把他当作贼。他的种种谬论引起到会艺人们的愤慨，遭到了有力的驳斥。
