    Leng Yu's speech requested that the central government instruct the Ministry of Water Resources, the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and transportation departments to attach importance to the treatment of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and to start work quickly.
    I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the treatment of the Yangtze River within Jiangsu Province.
    Jiangsu Province is located in the lowest reaches of the Yangtze River. The river flows in from Anhui, passing through twenty-two counties and cities before entering the sea. The total length of the riverbank on both the north and south sides is 720 kilometers. It is connected to the Huai River water system in the north and the Tai Lake water system in the south. The terrain along the river is flat, the products are abundant, the cultivated land area reaches 7.54 million mu, and the population is 4.93 million (excluding the urban population of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Nantong). There are about twenty major ports open to inland river navigation all year round. Shipping is developed and transportation is convenient. Therefore, the area along the river is the economic lifeline of Jiangsu Province and also the center of politics and culture.
    In recent decades (especially after the great flood of 1954), the riverbed of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been constantly changing. Particularly noticeable is the increasing curvature of the riverbed and the increase and expansion of sandbars, which has led to the serious development of riverbank collapse. According to surveys, there are already 52 sandbars of various sizes in the river. The largest, Chongming Island, has an area of 600,000 mu, Yangzhong has 250,000 mu, and the smallest are only 400 to 500 mu. Due to the increase and expansion of sandbars, the water level has risen, which has brought great disadvantages to flood control and drainage on both sides of the river. The changes in each section of the river are approximately as follows:
    1. From Dongliang Mountain Chenjia Zhou in Anhui Province to Nanjing, due to the increase in flood volume, the expansion of Jiujizhou in front of Xianrenji, the narrowness of the river surface between San Shanying and Qiba (only 1,200 meters wide), and the gradual expansion of Meizi Zhou in the lower reaches, the water level has risen, threatening Ma'anshan in Anhui Province. It has also caused riverbank collapses at Tongjing Estuary, Xijiang Estuary, and Jiufu Zhou in Jiangsu Province, causing the Qinhuai River to be backfilled by river water and drainage to be blocked.
    2. From Nanjing to Jiangyin, after Nanjing and Pukou built railways, they took advantage of the low water level to build wharves and factory buildings on both sides of the river, encroaching on the river surface day by day. At present, the river surface is only 1,100 meters wide, and the water flow is suddenly restricted, increasing the flow velocity and promoting changes in Bagua Zhou, resulting in the collapse of the Jiang'an riverbank below Xiejia Dian (the site of the Yongli Alkali Factory Ning Factory) on the north bank and Qixia Mountain on the south bank. As a result, the Nanjing Port and Yongli Ning Factory were forced to build revetments, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was relocated, costing the state tens of millions of yuan in investment. The downward movement of the main stream has accelerated the rapid growth of the beach in the Shierwei area, and the north channel of Shiye Zhou has gradually weakened (in the past, the main stream of Shiye Zhou was in the north of the island. According to old naval maps from the late Qing Dynasty, the west end of the island was 1.6 li (800 metres) from the riverbank of Shierwei, but it has now shrunk to about 300 metres), and the south channel has gradually strengthened and bypassed the north of Shiye Zhou, aggravating the riverbank collapse in the Gaozi area. At present, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in the Gaozi to Liubaidu section is only 1.2 kilometers away from the riverbank, which seriously threatens the safety of the railway. If no plans are made early, this section of the railway will follow in the footsteps of the Qixia Mountain to Longtan section. If it is relocated again, the amount of investment required by the state will be even more considerable. The increase in Zheng Runzhou below Shiye Zhou has caused serious riverbank collapses in the Liuyi to Doutianmiao section on the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the Liuyi area, the riverbank has collapsed by two to three kilometers in more than 20 years since 1931, losing tens of thousands of mu of land. Thousands of households in the area need to be resettled due to the riverbank collapse. Due to the northward movement of the river flow in this section, Zhenjiang Port is gradually silting up, causing obstacles to navigation in Zhenjiang Port. At present, the port relies on dredging the navigation channel every winter to maintain traffic between the north and south banks. The changes below Zhenjiang are even greater. There are Heshan Zhou, Yike Zhou, Gongxing Zhou, Nanmin Zhou, and Nanbei Zhou in the river. These unstable sandbars change differently with each flood. In Yangzhong County and Yong'an Zhou below Sanjiangying, not only are they affected by floods, but they are also affected by the Huai River entering the Yangtze River. In the case of simultaneous rises in the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, the safety of the dikes is seriously threatened, and sometimes it will cause the entire line from Sanjiangying to Yangwan on the north bank and from Guishantou to Yaoqiao on the south bank to collapse.
    3. From Jiangyin to the estuary, the river surface between Jiangyin Bawei Port is only 2,100 meters wide, and the water is deep and the flow is rapid. However, the river surface below Jiangyin suddenly expands, and the width of the river opposite Tiansheng Port is 11 kilometers. It is also affected by the tide, so the sandbars undulate and change unpredictably, and the situation of rising and collapsing on both sides is even more complicated. For example, Changyin Sha and Yong'an Sha rise and collapse repeatedly. The sand of Qingcao and Lianzhu in Changshu has risen by more than 10,000 mu in the past ten years. Due to the influence of Chongming Island, the north channel of the estuary is gradually silted up, and the main stream tends to flow to the south channel. The change in the river flow has also caused the collapse of the north bank, resulting in the collapse of the entire line below Hutong Port in Haimen County, collapsing 200 to 500 meters northward every year. The area near Tai'an Port in Qidong County collapsed by 6 kilometers before 1949. Although the south channel is protected by the Jiangnan seawall, the damage to the seawall is also developing seriously due to the attack of wind and waves and river flow, and the south bank of Chongming Island is also collapsing along the entire line.
    The above situation shows that the situation of the Yangtze Riverbed changing in Jiangsu Province is very serious. Because one or two 10,000 mu of good land is destroyed every year, if the average yield per mu is estimated to be 500 jin, the grain output will be reduced by 5 million to 10 million jin per year. At least 1,000 households of landless farmers are affected every year, and this is the case every year, which is really impossible to resettle. If we encounter a major flood like in 1954, the good land destroyed, the grain lost, and the number of farmers needing resettlement will greatly exceed this number. In addition, because fundamental measures are lacking in the treatment work, dikes must be built quickly, costing the state about one million yuan in investment every year, and further increasing the loss of land being excavated and pressed. Due to the collapse of the river dikes, the railway in the Gaozi area may soon be forced to relocate. Although the Nanjing, Pukou, Yongli Ning Factory, and Dasheng Three Factory's sunken revetment projects have invested a lot, they may only be able to provide temporary relief, treating the head when the head hurts and the foot when the foot hurts, and cannot guarantee that new collapses will not occur at both ends. The collapse of the riverbank in the Liuyi area has shortened the road to Yangzhou day by day, and the Zhenjiang Port on the south bank is about to be silted up, and the competent authorities are at a loss. The increasingly shallow and narrow north channel of Chongming Island will cause huge changes in the Yangtze River estuary.
    These are only the changes in the Yangtze Riverbank in Jiangsu Province. We have not made a detailed understanding of the situation in Anhui Province, but the changes in the riverbank are also very serious. If we do not actively make plans for fundamental treatment due to the rising and collapsing changes of the riverbank, it will not only cost the state a lot of investment and affect the stability of the lives of the people along the coast, but also the time will be delayed, and the changes in the riverbank will become more and more serious, and the cost of future treatment will be even greater. At the same time, the flood control problem of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu must not be ignored. Some people believe that Jiangsu Province suffered a particularly large flood in 1954, the water level in Nanjing reached 10.22 meters, exceeding the general maximum water level of 8.57 meters, and the time lasted for 110 days. The river dikes did not have any accidents, so they are blindly optimistic, which is a dangerous idea. Because, we must never forget: at that time, we barely survived the big flood without the favorable conditions of a typhoon. Since 1954, although the river dikes have been repaired every year, due to limited financial and human resources, the current height and width are far from the standard. If we encounter the high water level of 1954 and there is a typhoon at the same time, the existing river dikes cannot resist the high waves caused by the typhoon. The possibility of typhoons hitting the Yangtze River in Jiangsu during the flood season is very high, and it is by no means alarmist. If we cannot foresee this and take appropriate measures, the serious consequences of a disaster are unimaginable once there is an accident in the 1,000-kilometer-long river dikes and island dikes along the Yangtze River and many islands.
    The Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province receives water from 1.8 million square kilometers in 13 provinces. The general flow during the flood season is more than 50,000 cubic meters per second, and it was even more than 100,000 cubic meters per second in 1954. Therefore, it is impossible to consider the problem of Yangtze River treatment within the province by the power of the province. Although the Yangtze River Basin planning is actively underway, it seems that the 500 to 600-kilometer section of the Yangtze River throat from Datong to the estuary has not been given enough attention. The floods in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are indeed serious; but the floods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River cannot be ignored. The treatment of the Yangtze River must rely on the construction of reservoirs in the middle and upper reaches to regulate and control floods; but at the same time, the treatment of river channels in the lower reaches must be supplemented. We request that the central government instruct the Ministry of Water Resources, the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and the Ministry of Communications to attach importance to the treatment of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and to start work quickly. To this end, we put forward three suggestions:
    1. It is suggested that the relevant departments include the treatment of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the scope of the Yangtze River Basin planning.
    2. It is suggested that the relevant departments organize a meeting in the near future to specifically discuss and study the direction, methods, and steps for carrying out the treatment work in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
    3. It is suggested that the relevant departments quickly study and propose emergency measures for the urgent problems existing in Zhenjiang Port.
    We loudly appeal to the relevant parties: The treatment of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is really a task like a fire burning one's eyebrows. We believe that there should be no paralyzing thoughts or fluke psychology regarding the treatment of the Yangtze River within Jiangsu Province. We must be vigilant, pay close attention, take measures quickly, and actively treat it. Please give us your guidance on whether this is appropriate.

### 整治长江下游形同燃眉之急

    整治长江下游形同燃眉之急
    冷遹的发言要求中央责成水利部、长江流域规划办公室及交通等部门重视整治长江下游，迅速开展工作。
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长和彭副委员长的报告。现在，我就江苏省境内的长江整治问题，发表一些意见。
    江苏省地处长江最下游。江流自安徽入境，经过二十二个县、市入海。南北两面的江岸线共长七百二十公里。北面与淮河水系相通，南面与太湖水系相通，沿江地势平坦，物产丰富，耕地面积达七百五十四万亩，人口四百九十三万（不包括南京、镇江、南通三市市区人口），有南京、镇江、南通三个主要港埠，系沿江两岸物资集散地。常年对内河通航大港有二十条左右，航运发达，交通便利，所以沿江一带是江苏省经济的命脉，也是政治文化的中心。
    近几十年来（尤其是一九五四年大水以后），长江下游江床不断变迁。特殊显著的是江床的益形曲折和沙洲的增加与扩大，造成坍江情况的严重发展。经调查，江中已有大小五十二个沙洲，最大的崇明岛面积达六十万亩，扬中也有二十五万亩，最小的只四、五百亩。由于沙洲增加和扩大，因而水位抬高，给沿江两岸的防洪、排涝带来了很大的不利。沿江各段变迁情况约如下述：
    1、自安徽东西梁山陈家洲而下至南京一段，由于洪水来量的增加，仙人矶前救济洲的扩展，三山营与七坝间江面的狭束（宽仅一千二百公尺），以及下游梅子洲的日渐扩大，造成了水位的高涨，威胁到安徽省的马鞍山，并引起江苏省铜井河口、西江口及九袱洲的坍江，使秦淮河受到江水倒灌，排泄不畅。
    2、南京以下至江阴一段，由于南京、浦口在兴办铁路后，每有乘低水位时，在两岸兴建码头、厂屋，侵占江面日积月累，目前江面宽仅一千一百公尺，水流骤受约束，流速加大，促使八卦洲时起变化，造成北岸卸甲甸（即永利錏厂宁厂所在地）以下及南岸栖霞山江岸的崩坍，其结果是迫使南京港和永利宁厂修筑护岸，沪宁铁路搬家，耗费国家投资数以千万元计。主流的向下游变动，又使十二圩一带涨滩很快，世业洲北泓日渐削弱（世业洲过去主流在洲北，根据清末水师旧图记载，洲西头距十二圩江岸为一点六华里，合八百公尺，而目前已缩至约三百公尺），南泓日渐增强，并绕过世业洲北冲，加重了高资一带的坍江。目前沪宁铁路在高资至六摆渡一段离江岸仅一点二公里，严重威胁铁路的安全，如不早为之计，此段铁路势将步栖霞山至龙潭一段线路的后尘，如再迁移，则国家需投资的数字将更可观。世业洲以下征润洲的增涨，造成长江北岸六圩至都天庙段的严重坍江，六圩一带自一九三一年至今二十多年内已坍进达两三公里，损失土地达数万亩，该处群众因坍江需另作安置者数千户。由于该段江流北移，使镇江港逐渐淤塞，造成镇江港在航运上的阻碍，现该港每年冬季赖浚挖航槽来维持南北岸的交通。镇江以下的变迁就更大了。江中有和尚洲、益课洲、公兴洲、难民洲及南北洲，这些不稳定的沙洲，随着每次洪水的影响都有不同的变化。在三江营以下的扬中县与永安洲，不仅受洪水的影响，而且还受到淮水入江的影响，在江淮并涨的情况下，堤防安全更受到严重的威胁，有时会造成北岸三江营至杨湾、南岸龟山头至姚桥以下全线崩坍。
    3、江阴以下至海口一段，由于江阴八圩港间的江面宽仅二千一百公尺，水深流急；而江阴以下江面又突然扩展，天生港对江宽达十一公里，又受潮汐顶托影响，致沙洲起伏，变幻无常，两岸涨坍的情况，更是复杂。如常阴沙、永安沙涨而复坍，常熟的青草、联珠等沙，于十余年来已涨出万亩以上。海口由于崇明岛的影响，北泓日渐淤涨，主流趋向南泓。江流的转变，又造成北岸的坍江，致海门县浒通港以下全线崩坍，每年向北坍进二百至五百公尺，启东县泰安港附近在一九四九年前曾坍去六公里，南泓虽有江南海塘建筑的保护，但受风浪与江流的袭击，海塘的损坏情况也在严重的发展，而崇明岛南岸也在全线发生坍塌。
    以上情况说明，在江苏境内长江河床变迁的情况是非常严重的。由于每年要坍毁良田一两万亩，如从低估计平均每亩产量以五百斤计，每年就要减少粮食产量五百至一千万斤。失地农民每年至少在一千户以上，年年如此，实已无法安置。如遇像一九五四年的大水，则塌毁良田、损失粮食以及需要安置的农户，还要大大超过这个数字。此外，并因为整治工作缺乏根本措施，必须赶建退堤，每年还要耗费国家投资约一百万元之巨，而且更增加了土地挖废、压废的损失。由于江堤坍塌，高资一带的铁路，恐很快就要被迫搬家；南京、浦口、永利宁厂、大生三厂等处的沉排护岸工程虽然投资很大，恐亦只能临时救急，起头痛医头、脚痛医脚的作用，不能保住上下两端不发生新的坍势；六圩一带江岸坍塌，至扬州公路日益缩短，南岸镇江港即将淤废，主管部门竟至束手无策；而崇明岛北泓的日形浅狭，更将造成长江入海口门的发生巨大变化。
    这些还只是长江江岸在江苏省境内的变动情况，在安徽省境内，我们未作详细了解，但江岸的变动情况也是很严重的。由于江岸的涨塌变动，不积极作根治打算，不仅耗费国家大量投资，影响沿岸人民生活的安定，而且时日迁延，江岸变动情况益趋严重，将来治理费用亦将更为浩大。同时，江苏境内长江的防洪问题也绝不容忽视。有人认为，江苏省在一九五四年曾遭受特大洪水的侵袭，南京水位达十点二二公尺，超过一般最高水位八点五七公尺，时间持续至一百一十一天。江堤并未出险，因而盲目乐观，这种思想是危险的。因为，我们绝对不能忘记：当时是在没有台风的有利情况下，勉强渡过大汛的。一九五四年以来，江堤虽年有培修，但限于财力人力，目前高度宽度还远不够标准，如遇到一九五四年的高水位，同时再有台风，则现有的江堤是不能抗御因台风而激起的高浪打袭的。在江苏长江汛期遇到台风袭击，可能性是很大的，绝不是危言耸听，我们如果不能预见到这一点，并采取适当措施，沿江两岸和许多洲岛全长达一千公里的江堤、洲堤，一旦遇有不测，灾害发生的严重后果将不堪设想。
    长江在江苏境内上承十三省一百八十余万平方公里的来水，汛期一般流量在五万秒公方以上，一九五四年更大至超过十万秒公方，因此，由省的力量来考虑境内长江整治问题是不可能的。目前长江流域规划虽已在积极进行，但对大通以下至海口的五百至六百公里一段长江咽喉，似尚未能加以重视。长江中游的水灾确是严重的；但是长江下游的水灾也不容忽视，整治长江必须依靠中上游修建水库调节控制洪水；但同时必须辅以下游河道的整治工作。我们要求中央责成水利部、长江流域规划办公室及交通部等部门，对长江下游整治问题加以重视，并迅速展开工作。为此，特提出三项建议：
    一、建议有关部门将长江下游整治问题列入长江流域规划的范围。
    二、建议有关部门在近期内组织会议，专门讨论研究长江下游整治工作的方向、方法和开展工作的步骤。
    三、建议有关部门对当前镇江港存在的迫切问题，迅速研究，提出紧急措施。
    我们向有关方面大声疾呼：长江下游的整治工作，实在是一个形同燃眉之急的任务。我们认为：对江苏省境内的长江整治问题，不能存有麻痹思想和侥幸心理；必须提高警惕，严予重视，迅速采取措施，积极加以整治，是否有当，请大家指教。
