Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The Central Academy of Arts and Crafts held a general meeting of teachers and students on the 22nd to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing group headed by Pang Xunqin, the vice president of the academy.

　　Wang Yunfeng, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, exposed Pang Xunqin's conspiracy to disintegrate the Party branch. She said that Pang Xunqin used Liu Shouqiang, a rightist within the Party, to create division within the Party. Liu Shouqiang opposed the higher Party committee sending Party cadres to work at the academy, believing that he and He Yanming (another rightist) could completely handle the work well. During the rectification campaign, rightists such as Pang Xunqin and Liu Shouqiang attacked the leading group, claiming that the Party branch was already paralyzed and could not lead the rectification, demanding the reorganization of the Party branch. Liu Shouqiang also demanded that rightists Pang Xunqin and He Yanming join the Party's rectification leading group, saying that He Yanming "has ways of carrying out movements," and that Pang Xunqin represents the China Democratic League, and "the rectification movement must be led by Pang Xunqin to be carried out well."

　　Lei Guiyuan, an arts and crafts artist and vice president, exposed in his speech that Pang Xunqin used to engage in bourgeois formalist painting, and his subsequent shift to arts and crafts was due to his desire to seize leadership in arts and crafts, considering arts and crafts to be a "cold sector." Lei Guiyuan also pointed out that Pang Xunqin had consistently opposed leadership in the past when he was at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He warned Pang Xunqin to honestly confess his anti-Party words and deeds and not to take a dead end.

　　Teacher Luo Muyun focused on criticizing Pang Xunqin's reactionary "system plan." She said that the main program of the Pang Xunqin right-wing group was the "Central Academy of Arts and Crafts Organizational Regulations," which is the "system plan." The essence of this "summary" is to abolish Party leadership. Article 2 of the plan, "The academy affairs committee shall be elected by all parties, including representatives from various departments, representatives of professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff representatives, Communist Party, democratic parties, trade unions, and Communist Youth League representatives," reduces the role of the Party to the status of a general mass organization, fundamentally negating the Party's leading role. Article 3 stipulates that the president and vice presidents shall be elected, and the State Council merely handles their appointment and removal procedures. From this, it can be seen that the rightists say they still want Party leadership, but in reality, they are kicking the Communist Party aside and taking control of the arts and crafts sector themselves.

　　Lecturer Chen Ruoju exposed Pang Xunqin's article published in the People's Daily entitled "Following the Party, the Truth Will Always See the Sun," as a poisonous weed that attacks the Party, distorts facts, and attempts to win the support of the people of the whole country. It compared the Ministry of Culture to "heartless parents" and viewed the leadership of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration over the academy as "unreasonable and rude interference," distorting the speech of Bai Rubing, the Party Secretary of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration, portraying Bai Rubing as an overbearing bureaucrat. All of this is untrue.

　　Teaching assistant Liang Rensheng said that in order to seize leadership in the arts and crafts field, Pang Xunqin has consistently squeezed out senior arts and crafts veterans, excluded Party member experts, and flaunted himself. The National Arts and Crafts Exhibition was designed by experts Zhang Ding and Professor Zhang Guangyu, but Pang Xunqin promoted himself everywhere, exaggerating his achievements and abilities. Furthermore, he attacked these two experts behind their backs, saying, "We cannot learn from Zhang Ding and Zhang Guangyu, and we cannot pursue primitive meaning (folk art)." Liang Rensheng also revealed that in Suzhou, Pang Xunqin used the issue of wages to incite the dissatisfaction of artisans with the government, viciously saying: "The wage system is inhumane and is a disguised form of exploitation."

　　Pang Xunqin stated at the meeting that he would bow his head to the people and continue to examine and confess. This meeting will continue.

### 中央工艺美术学院向右派进行斗争  拆穿庞熏琴的阴谋

    中央工艺美术学院向右派进行斗争
    拆穿庞熏琴的阴谋
    新华社24日讯　中央工艺美术学院22日召开全院师生大会。揭发批判以该院副院长庞熏琴为首的右派集团的反动言行。
    党支部副书记王云凤揭发了庞熏琴瓦解党支部的阴谋。她说庞熏琴利用党内的右派分子刘守强制造党的分裂。刘守强反对上级党委派党的干部来学院工作，认为有他和何燕明（另一个右派分子）就可以完全把工作搞好。整风期间，庞熏琴、刘守强等右派分子打击领导小组，认为党支部已经瘫痪了，不能领导整风，要求改组党支部。刘守强并要求右派分子庞熏琴、何燕明加入党的整风领导小组，说何燕明“搞运动有办法”，说庞熏琴是代表民盟的，“整风运动必须由庞熏琴来领导才能搞好。”
    工艺美术家、副院长雷圭元在发言中揭发了庞熏琴从前是搞资产阶级形式主义绘画的，后来其所以转到工艺美术事业上来是由于他想夺取工艺美术的领导权，认为工艺美术是“冷门”。雷圭元还说明庞熏琴过去在中央美术学院时就是一直反对领导的。他警告庞熏琴要老实交代反党言行，不要走绝路。
    教员罗慕云重点批判了庞熏琴的反动的“体制方案”。她说，庞熏琴右派集团主要的纲领就是“中央工艺美术学院组织条例简则”也就是“体制方案”。这个“简则”的实质就是取消党的领导。方案的第二条“院务委员会由各方面选举产生，包括各系代表，教授、讲师、助教代表、职工代表、共产党、民主党派、工会、共青团代表”，这就把党的作用降低到一般群众团体的地位，根本否定了党的领导作用。第三条规定了院长、副院长由选举产生，国务院只不过替他们办理任免手续而已。由此可见，右派分子口头上说他们还是要党的领导，实际上他们是把共产党一脚踢开，由他们来把持工艺美术事业。
    讲师陈若菊揭发了庞熏琴在人民日报上发表的题为“跟着党走，真理总会见太阳”的文章，是对党进行攻击、歪曲事实，并企图骗取全国人民支持的一株毒草。它把文化部比作“忍心的父母”，把中央手工业管理局对学院的领导看成是“无理而又粗暴的干涉”，歪曲了中央手工业管理局党组书记白如冰的讲话，把白如冰描写成一个盛气凌人的官僚主义者。而这些都是不合事实的。
    助教梁任生说庞熏琴为了夺取工艺美术界的领导权，一贯地排挤工艺美术的老前辈、排斥党员专家，标榜自己。全国工艺美术展览会是专家张仃、教授张光宇设计的，但庞熏琴却到处宣扬自己，夸功显能。并且他还在背后打击这两位专家，说“不能学张仃和张光宇，不能追求原始意味（民间美术）。”梁任生还揭发了庞熏琴在苏州曾借工资问题，煽动手工艺人对政府的不满，恶毒地说：“工资制度不人道，是变相的剥削。”
    庞熏琴在会上表示向人民低头，要继续检查交代。这个大会还将继续举行。
