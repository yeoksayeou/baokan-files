	Mosquito Larva and Mosquitoes
	Lǚ Dān

	After a burst of rain, rainwater flooded the land, like a river bursting its banks, flowing towards the oceans, rivers, and lakes. At the same time, it also rushed into that dark and foul-smelling puddle.... Many creatures living in the foul-smelling puddle bravely jumped into this new water source, washing away the sour stench that had accumulated from living in the foul-smelling puddle for so long.

	The mosquito larva, however, shouted loudly, "This is simply violence! Cruel! Destroying my comfortable life!"

	Immediately following was a gentle breeze and light rain, and the clear water on the ground became more abundant day by day; the giant currents that were formed were constantly flowing to all places.

	As a result, the mosquito larva became more and more resentful, and the more resentful it became, the more frustrated it became. Finally, it shouted, "You all say the foul-smelling puddle is bad, but it nurtured life! And you are slaughtering living beings! This is the destruction of morality!" As it spoke, it became lost in memories: "Oh, foul-smelling puddle, how beautiful you are!..."

	These remarks of his were deeply approved by the mosquito: "You have courage! You have backbone! You will become 'great' historical figures, and I express my support, admiration, and endorsement of you."

	"Only mosquitoes are true friends," the mosquito larva thought. Therefore, it hated everything, hated rivers, hated aquatic creatures, hated humans. So it frantically jumped, bumped, and shook, trying to shake the entire world with its tiny body. But when it realized that its plan could not be achieved, when it realized that the past environment was gone forever, it became powerless, decayed, withered, and finally, only a shell remained.

	It is not known who discovered this secret: mosquito larvae and mosquitoes are originally from the same family.

    孑孓和蚊子
    吕丹
    一阵暴雨过后，雨水漫着大地，像决了口的洪潮，流向海洋、江河和湖泊。同时，也冲进那幽暗的臭水坑……。生活在臭水坑里的许多生物，都勇敢地跳进这新的水源，洗涤着由于长期生长在臭水坑中而沾染的周身酸臭。
    孑孓却大叫大嚷：“这简直是暴力！残酷！破坏我舒适的生活！”
    紧接着是和风细雨，地面上清澈的水，一天多似一天；汇成的巨流，不断地向所有的地方流着。
    这一来，孑孓越想越恨，越恨也就越懊恼。最后大声疾呼：“你们都说臭水坑不好，但它孕育了生命！而你们，正在屠杀生灵！这是道德的毁灭！”它说着，说着，又沉醉在回忆里：“臭水坑哟，你是多么美丽哟！……”
    它的这些言论，深深地得到蚊子的赞许：“有胆识！有骨气！你们将要成为‘伟大的’历史人物，我表示对你拥护、钦佩和支持。”
    “只有蚊子才够朋友”，孑孓想。因而它恨透一切，恨江河、恨水族、恨人类。于是它疯狂地跳呀、撞呀、摇呀，想用它那细小的身躯，动摇整个世界。可是当它意识到自己的打算不能达到的时候，意识到过去的环境已一去不返的时候，它无力了，衰败了，干枯了，最后，只剩下一个躯壳。
    不知是谁发现了这个机密：孑孓和蚊子本来是一家子。
