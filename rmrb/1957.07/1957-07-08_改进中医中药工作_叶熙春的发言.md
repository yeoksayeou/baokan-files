I have attended this meeting and listened to the reports of the leaders. In addition to fully endorsing them, I would like to offer a few suggestions for improving the work of traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology for your reference.

Improving the Ways and Methods of Western Doctors Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the important instruction that "Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine is the key to doing a good job in traditional Chinese medicine and carrying forward the legacy of the motherland's medicine," various localities have actively organized Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine, promoting the advance of Western medicine towards traditional Chinese medicine. Since its inception, in addition to full-time study, which has achieved certain results and gains, there are still some common problems in on-the-job learning, and there are cases where it cannot be sustained. For example, the on-the-job Western medicine study class in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, has been held for nearly a year, and the number of students is decreasing and their enthusiasm for learning is declining. From the initial 80 to 90 students, it has now decreased to 10 to 20 people. In Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing and other places, classes were suspended midway not long after they started. According to preliminary understanding, the main reasons can be divided into the following aspects: (1) The leading departments have not conscientiously implemented the principle of voluntary participation in learning, nor have they regularly carried out ideological work on the students to inspire and encourage their enthusiasm. (2) Since on-the-job learning is carried out without affecting the original work and political theory study, there are contradictions in time. There is neither enough time to review lessons, and only four hours of study per week is equivalent to "exposing it to the sun for one day and freezing it for ten days." Therefore, it is difficult to persist in learning. (3) In terms of teaching, the central government stipulates that students should start with the classics and adhere to the original text, so the speakers cannot participate in new opinions, so they do not speak deeply or thoroughly, and the listeners feel boring and retreat in fear, which affects their low enthusiasm for learning.

From the above situation, I believe that there is still a need to study and improve the ways and methods of Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine. I would like to put forward the following incorrect opinions for the leadership's reference: (1) Western doctors should completely adopt voluntary participation in learning traditional Chinese medicine, and should not force everyone to learn it. Those who are unwilling to continue learning can be allowed to withdraw automatically to save manpower and material resources and maintain a certain quality. (2) On-the-job learning should be changed to full-time learning to ensure learning time, so that students can concentrate on studying and work hard. (3) The learning methods and steps should be from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, step by step. At the same time, in theoretical learning, a certain amount of time must be arranged so that Chinese and Western medicine can closely cooperate in clinical practice, so as to gradually link with reality and establish confidence in learning. In terms of teachers, in addition to hiring full-time Chinese medicine practitioners with a certain theoretical level and clinical experience, each course should be taught by one person from beginning to end in order to achieve consistency and ease of understanding.

Zhejiang Province's Traditional Chinese Medicine Work Should Be Quickly Transferred to the Leadership of the Health Department

Zhejiang Province is one of the major medicinal material producing areas in the country, ranking second in the country in terms of output. According to the province's survey of raw drugs and category statistics, there are more than 400 species, including more than 60 species of artificially cultivated medicinal materials, more than 260 species of wild medicinal materials, and nearly 100 species of animal and mineral medicinal materials, distributed in the province's main mountainous areas such as Tiantai, Tianmu, Kuocang, Siming, and other wasteland and fields. Among these more than 400 kinds of medicinal materials, according to the 1956 statistics, there are more than 60 kinds that are exported abroad. Therefore, the development of traditional Chinese medicine is not only closely related to the health care of the broad masses of working people, but also has great significance and role in increasing national economic income and earning foreign exchange to support industrial construction. In particular, the province has a long history of medicinal material cultivation, and the mountain farmers have rich production experience, which has a broader prospect for development. However, in recent years, due to the lack of strengthened leadership and sufficient attention to the management of traditional Chinese medicine production by relevant departments, the output of traditional Chinese medicine in the province and other regions has declined significantly, failing to keep up with the needs of the development of traditional Chinese medicine, forming frequent disconnections between the supply and marketing of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine have become a prominent contradiction in the current health care cause. Last year, I raised this issue at the National People's Congress, but a year has passed and it has not been resolved. Recently, Yu Xiuzhang, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Political Consultative Conference and manager of Shiqing Yu Tang, said, "The shortage of medicines is becoming more and more serious." General Chinese medicine practitioners also generally reflect: "There is a feeling that clinical prescriptions cannot be prescribed according to the symptoms." Therefore, in order to give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine and meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of the people, it is an urgent matter to actively strengthen the leadership and management of traditional Chinese medicine. Although the State Council has decided to transfer all the national traditional Chinese medicine supply institutions and traditional Chinese medicine processing and manufacturing plants to the unified leadership of the health department to ensure that traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine are closely integrated from the organization and strengthen the scientific research work of traditional Chinese medicine. This wise measure is completely correct and timely. However, the province's commercial departments have not yet done so according to the central instructions. To this day, the health department has not yet implemented the takeover of traditional Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, it is suggested that the central government should quickly transfer the instructions on the unified leadership and management of traditional Chinese medicinal materials by the health department to the relevant departments for implementation. Because the management of traditional Chinese medicine business in conjunction with the work of traditional Chinese medicine is in line with the traditional habit of "medicine inseparable from medicine" inherent in China's thousands of years of history. At the same time, only under unified leadership, unified management, and overall planning can traditional Chinese medicine be fully developed and better serve socialist construction.

Organize Traditional Chinese Medicine Apprenticeships with Comprehensive Planning and Attention to Quality

Since the central government proposed in 1956 that in order to inherit the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and continuously expand the health care team, we should encourage traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to take apprentices and train 500,000 to 300,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners within a certain period of time. However, after the task and indicators were put forward, no specific measures for taking apprentices have been formulated. It is not a simple matter for old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to take apprentices. In the past, there was a certain tradition. Because the academic knowledge of old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners was different and there were no unified teaching materials, the way of taking apprentices and what they taught were different. At the same time, the level of those who were taken was also uneven, ranging from elementary school to university, and the absorption capacity varied greatly. Therefore, in order to encourage traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to take good apprentices, a comprehensive consideration should be given to the above series of issues.

Since the measure of taking apprentices is to inherit the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and promote the convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, it should be based on quality and should not blindly pursue quantity. It seems to be less objective to put forward the indicators for taking apprentices without comprehensive planning. At the same time, we cannot regard taking apprentices as an isolated work. We should realize that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking good apprentices is a part of the entire work of traditional Chinese medicine and is inseparable from doing a good job in the entire work of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, it is recommended that the central health department must attach importance to this issue and include traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices in the plan, and take them in an organized and guided manner to ensure the apprentices a certain quality, so that they can play a good role in inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Also, I don't know the names of apprentices in other places. In the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, before liberation, the apprentice system of hundreds of crafts had been abolished, and the name of apprentice no longer existed. Most of them were changed to art apprentices or apprentices. Those who could engage in operation were called trainees. Why after liberation, we call students traditional Chinese medicine apprentices. Moreover, most of those who come to learn traditional Chinese medicine are intellectuals, junior high school or high school students. It is inevitable that it is not appropriate to be apprentices. Generally, it is reflected that the health department should consider changing the name to students, medical students, or apprentices, etc. to be worthy of the name.

Give Play to the Role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Schistosomiasis

The province has been carrying out the treatment of schistosomiasis with traditional Chinese medicine for two years. Thanks to the joint efforts of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, many treatment methods have been proposed. In terms of internal medicine: such as "Compound Insecticidal Pills", "Golden Yellow Pills", "New Fang Shi Zao Pills", "Compound Water Grass", "Realgar Asafoetida Insecticidal Mixture"...etc. In terms of external treatment: such as "Acupuncture", "Suppurative Moxibustion"...etc. have all achieved different results. For example, the preliminary efficacy statistics of "Compound Insecticidal Pills" has reached 53.1%. However, due to the lack of strong organizational leadership, its true efficacy cannot be brought into play. Secondly, in terms of the number of beds for traditional Chinese medicine treatment of schistosomiasis, there is no overall arrangement. For example, in 1956, the Third Hospital of Hangzhou City allocated 180 beds for traditional Chinese medicine treatment, and this year it suddenly reduced to 30 beds. Although the source of patients is scarce, the relevant departments have not paid enough attention to the development of traditional Chinese medicine in schistosomiasis prevention and control. Therefore, I believe that in order to comply with the requirements put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to eliminate schistosomiasis within seven years, the relevant departments of the Central Committee must continue to strengthen the organizational leadership of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of schistosomiasis in order to give full play to the strength of traditional Chinese medicine and further study and explore on the basis of the experience already gained.

Secondly, in terms of organizing patients, since the agricultural cooperativization, the countryside has generally entered a high tide of production, and farmers have been calculated according to wage points. If treatment is carried out, it will affect production and life, so medical and prevention units in various places feel that mobilizing patients is a difficult task. This issue has become a prominent contradiction in the current development of schistosomiasis treatment. If this contradiction is not resolved, the treatment task will be difficult to complete. Therefore, the health department should quickly conduct research with other relevant departments and take reasonable measures to unfold the treatment work under the principle of not affecting production.

Resolutely Consolidate the Young Socialist System

Finally, I believe that Chairman Mao's speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has an inestimable contribution and is playing a huge role in promoting the current socialist construction.

The great Communist Party of China is the core of leading the motherland's cause. It is entrusted by the 600 million people of the country and shoulders the heavy responsibility of building socialism in the motherland. In order to better and faster promote the development of the construction cause, and in order to better consolidate and give play to its leading core role in the motherland's cause, the rectification movement was launched. Since the "letting go" and "speaking out" of the rectification movement began, many non-Party members have put forward many opinions to the Party in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, most of which are correct and thus help the Party's rectification. But at the same time, some "evil winds" have also appeared, going beyond the scope of handling contradictions among the people, releasing some absurd remarks that are difficult to tolerate, such as anti-socialism, anti-Communist Party leadership, anti-people's democratic dictatorship...etc., dreaming of trying to take the opportunity of the rectification movement to overthrow the Communist Party and the working class and make the new China return to the status of a capitalist semi-colony. Therefore, the emergence of these reactionary remarks is not accidental, it has a certain ideological root, and it has a certain purpose. But after all, it cannot escape the bright eyes of our 600 million people, because the 600 million people still remember the lack of food and clothing under the reactionary ruling regime in the past... From personal experience, they recognize that the "evil wind" is a poisonous weed. It will hinder our socialist construction, and no one will allow it to grow. Therefore, in the past few days, all sectors of society have used a serious and earnest attitude to criticize these fallacies and give them a crushing blow.

Comrades! Let's look back, the People's Republic of China has only been established for eight years. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, the international status has been improved, the national construction has developed rapidly, and the people's lives have gradually improved. This is obvious to all. It also specifically proves that only by taking the bright road of socialism can we have today.

Therefore, our 600 million people across the country must unite as one, raise our vigilance, stand firm, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely consolidate the people's democratic power, resolutely consolidate the young socialist system, to fight back against the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements and political careerists, and we will never give up until we win!

Celebrate the successful conclusion of the conference! Good health to all representatives!

### 改进中医中药工作  叶熙春的发言

    改进中医中药工作
    叶熙春的发言
    我参加这次会议，听取了各位首长报告，除完全拥护外，兹提出有关中医中药工作改进数点，以供参考。
    西医学习中医的方式方法需要改进
    自从中共中央提出“西医学习中医是作好中医工作，发扬祖国医学遗产的关键所在”重要指示以后，各地都积极地组织了西医学习中医班，推动西医向祖国医学进军。开办以来，除脱产学习已得到一定的成绩和收获外，对在职学习方面，还普遍存在着一些问题，有不能坚持下去的情况。如浙江省杭州市举办在职西医学习中医班已近年余，学员愈来愈少，学习情绪愈来愈低，由开始八、九十人的学习，目前已减少至一、二十人。宁波、绍兴、嘉兴等处开班未久，均已中途停止。根据初步了解，其主要原因可分下列几方面：（1）领导部门没有认真贯彻自愿参加学习的原则，也没有经常的对学员进行思想工作，启发鼓舞他们的积极性。（2）由于在职学习是在不影响原有工作和政治理论等学习下进行的，所以在时间上都有矛盾，既无充分时间温课，而且每周仅抽出四小时的学习，等于“一日曝之，十日寒之”。因此要坚持学习，困难重重。（3）教学方面，中央规定先从经典学起，又要宗于原文，致讲者不能参加新的意见，因而讲得不深不透，听者感到枯燥乏味，畏难却步，影响学习情绪低落。
    从以上情况来看，我认为在西医学习中医方式方法等方面，尚有研究改进的必要。初步提出如下几点不正确的意见，以供领导上的参考。（1）西医学习中医应完全采取自愿参加，不能强求一律普遍地学，对不愿继续学习者，可同意其自动退出，以节省人力物力，并保持一定的质量。（2）在职学习，一律改为脱产学习，使学习时间有保证，在学习中可以集中精力，努力钻研。（3）学习方法与步骤，应从浅入深，由易到难，循序渐进，同时在理论学习中，必须安排一定时间，使中西医能在临床上的密切合作，做到逐步联系实际，从而树立学习信心。在教师方面除聘请有一定理论水平和临床经验的中医师专职担任外，每一种功课应由一人主讲到底，以求得前后一致，易于理解。
    浙江省中药工作应赶快划归卫生部门领导
    浙江省为全国主要药材产区之一，产量居全国第二位。根据全省生药调查和品类统计达四百余种，其中人工栽培药材有六十余种，野生药材有二百六十余种、动物及矿物药材约近百种，分布全省主要山区如天台、天目、括苍、四明以及其他荒地田塍等处。在这四百多种药材中，属于出国外销者，根据一九五六年统计亦达六十余种。因此发展中药不仅在广大劳动人民保健事业上有着密切的关系，同时在增加国民经济收益、换取外汇支援工业建设上，也具有重大意义和作用。特别是本省药材栽培历史悠久，山区药农生产经验丰富，是更有他广阔的发展前途。但几年来，由于有关部门对中药生产管理工作缺乏加强领导和足够的重视，致本省以及其他各地区对中药产量，均有显著下降，跟不上中医事业发展的需要，形成中药供销经常脱节。所以中医和中药已成为当前保健事业中一个突出的矛盾。去年在全国人代会议中，我曾提出这个问题，但时隔一年，迄未获得解决。最近本省政协召开时期庆余堂经理俞秀章委员曾提出：“药荒是愈来愈严重了。”一般中医师也普遍反映：“临床处方大有不能对症下药的感慨。”因此要充分发挥中医中药的作用和满足广大人民的迫切需要，积极加强中药领导和管理，已是一件刻不容缓的事情。虽然国务院已决定把全国中药材供应机构和中药加工制造厂全部移交给卫生部门统一领导，从组织上保证使中医药密切结合起来，加强中医药的科学研究工作。这一个英明措施，是完全正确的，也是及时的。但本省商业部门还没有根据中央指示来做，迟至今日，卫生部门迄未实行中药材的接管。因此建议中央应迅速转致有关部门贯彻中药材由卫生部门统一领导与管理的指示。因为中药业务与中医工作结合起来管理，是符合我国几千年来历史上所固有的“药不离医”传统习惯。同时也只有在统一领导、统一管理、统筹安排下，才能使中医药获得全面的发展，能够更好的为社会主义建设而服务。
    组织中医带徒弟要全面规划重视质量
    自一九五六年中央提出为了继承祖国医学遗产，为了不断扩大卫生队伍，鼓励中医带徒弟，能在一定时间内培养五十万——三十万中医师。但提出了这个任务和指标以后，迄未拟订出带徒弟的具体办法。旧中医带徒弟并不是一件简单的事情，过去是有他一定的传统，由于老中医学术不一，没有统一教材，因此，带的方式和所教的东西也各有一套。同时被带者的水平，也高低不一，从初小到大学都有，吸收能力，相差悬殊。所以要鼓励中医带好徒弟，对以上一系列问题，应作全面的考虑。
    由于带徒弟的措施是为了继承祖国医学遗产，并促进中西医的合流，所以应该建立在质的基础上，不能盲目追求数量。没有经过全面规划，而提出带徒弟指标，似乎是比较欠客观的。同时也不能把带徒弟认为是一件孤立的工作，应该认识到中医带好徒弟，是整个中医工作中的一部分，与搞好整个中医工作是分不开的。因此，建议中央卫生部门必须重视这个问题，把中医带徒弟应该列入计划，有组织、有领导的来带，以保证徒弟一定的质量，使在继承和发扬祖国医学遗产中，能起着他良好的作用。又徒弟名称，他处我不知，在江浙两省百工手艺，解放前，将带徒弟制度已取消，徒弟名称已不存在，多改称艺徒或学徒，稍能从事操作者称练习生，何以解放以后，我们收学生倒称中医带徒弟，况来学中医者多是知识分子，初中或高中的学生，再来做徒弟未免不称，一般反映，建议卫生部门是否考虑能改称学生、医学生或学徒等，以名副其实。
    发挥中医中药对治疗血吸虫病的作用
    本省开展中医中药治疗血吸虫病，已将两年，由于中西医共同努力，也提出了不少治疗方法。在内服方面：如“复剂杀虫丸”，“金黄丸”，“新方十枣丸”，“复水草”，“雄黄阿魏杀虫合剂”……等。外治方面：如“针刺”“化浓灸”……等，均都取得了不同的效果，如“复剂杀虫丸”初步疗效统计已达百分之五十三点一。但由于组织领导不强，因此还不能把它的确实疗效发挥出来。其次在中医中药治疗血吸虫病病床数量方面，也没有进行统筹安排，如一九五六年度杭州市第三医院，曾划出一百八十张病床作为中医中药治疗，至本年度又骤然减至为三十张。虽然病员来源稀少，但有关部门对中医中药在血防工作中的开展，还没有足够的重视。因此我认为要遵照党中央和毛主席所提出的要求，在七年内消灭血吸虫病的这个任务，建议中央有关部门必须继续加强对中医中药治疗血吸虫病的组织领导，以充分发挥中医力量，在已经取得经验的基础上，来进一步钻研和发掘。
    其次对组织病员方面，由于农业合作化以来，农村普遍进入生产高潮，农民均已按照工资分计算，如进行治疗，就要影响生产和生活，所以各地医防单位都感到动员病员是一件困难的事情。这个问题，已成为目前开展血吸虫病治疗工作中所存在的一个突出的矛盾。这个矛盾不解决，治疗任务就很难完成，因此卫生部门应迅速与其他有关部门进行研究，采取合理措施，使如何在不影响生产的原则下，来展开治疗工作。
    坚决地巩固年轻的社会主义制度
    最后，我认为毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话的发表，是有无可估量的贡献，对当前社会主义建设起着巨大的推动作用。
    伟大的中国共产党，是领导祖国事业的核心，他受着全国六亿人民的重托，肩负着祖国建设社会主义的重任。为了更好地、更快地推动建设事业的发展，为了更好地使党在祖国事业中巩固和发挥它的领导核心作用，才发动这次整风运动。自从整风运动开始“放”“鸣”以来，很多党外人士都本着知无不言，言无不尽的精神，对党提出了很多意见，大部分是正确的，因而有助于党的整风。但与此同时，也出现了一些“歪风”，越出了处理人民内部矛盾的范围，放出些令人难以容忍的反社会主义、反共产党领导、反人民民主专政……等等荒谬的言论，梦想企图乘整风运动机会，把共产党和工人阶级推翻，使新中国再回到资本主义半殖民地的地位。所以这些反动言论的产生，并不出于偶然，是有它一定的思想根源，和有它一定的目的。但终究逃不出我们六亿人民的雪亮眼睛，因为六亿人民对过去反动统治政权下的食不饱，衣不暖……记忆还存，从切身体验中，认识“歪风”是毒草。会妨害我们的社会主义建设，谁都不容许它生长。所以这几天社会各阶层都已经用严肃认真的态度，批判了这些谬论，给予粉碎的打击。
    同志们！我们回顾一下，中华人民共和国成立才八年，只有在共产党的领导下，国际地位提高了，国家建设突飞猛进了，人民生活逐步改善了，这是有目共睹的。也具体证明了只有走社会主义光明大道，才能有了今天。
    因此，我们全国六亿人民，要一致团结起来，提高警惕，站稳立场，在共产党的领导下，坚决地巩固人民民主政权，坚决地巩固年轻的社会主义制度，以回击右派分子和政治野心家的猖狂嚣张的进攻，不获胜利，决不罢休！
    庆祝大会胜利成功！各位代表身体健康！
