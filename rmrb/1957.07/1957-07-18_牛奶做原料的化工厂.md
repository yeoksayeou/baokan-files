    A Chemical Plant Using Milk as Raw Material
    In the fertile pasture area of Sartu in Heilongjiang Province, a dairy product chemical plant – the Anda Lactose Plant – is under construction.
    This factory will utilize the abundant milk produced in the pastoral area to process and extract lactose, casein, and cream. Lactose is an essential raw material for manufacturing valuable medicines such as penicillin and aureomycin, while casein is a raw material for manufacturing artificial leather, artificial mica, film, coatings, dyes and other colloidal chemical industrial products.
    The Anda Lactose Plant is expected to be completed and put into production by the first half of next year. The main equipment for the factory is supplied by the Czechoslovak Republic.

    牛奶做原料的化工厂
    在水草肥美的黑龙江省萨尔图牧区，正在建设一座乳产品化工厂——安达乳糖厂。
    这个工厂将利用牧区盛产的大量牛奶，加工提炼出乳糖、干酪素和奶油。乳糖是制造青霉素、金霉素等贵重药品的必需原料，干酪素是制造人造皮革、人造云母、胶片、涂料、染料等胶质化工工业的原材料。
    安达乳糖厂到明年上半年可以完工投入生产。工厂的主要设备是由捷克斯洛伐克共和国供应的。
