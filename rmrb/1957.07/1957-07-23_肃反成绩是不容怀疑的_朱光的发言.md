    The Achievements of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Are Beyond Doubt
    Zhu Guang's Speech
    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and all the reports of the conference.
    In 1956, Guangzhou, like the rest of the country, achieved great victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction, fundamentally changing the face of Guangzhou. Similarly, in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, tremendous achievements were also made. Right-wing elements attempt to obliterate our country's glorious achievements over the past few years, especially by wantonly slandering the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, I will make a speech on the situation of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Guangzhou since 1955.
    The Launching of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Struggle Was to Meet the Needs of the State and the People
    It was absolutely necessary to launch the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1955. At that time, we were on the eve of the high tide of the socialist revolution. The people of Guangzhou, along with the people of the whole country, were fighting for the victory of the socialist revolution. However, the remaining counter-revolutionaries and the special agents of the imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek groups were actively carrying out various sabotage activities. They targeted the various measures of socialist transformation, spreading rumors, writing reactionary slogans, and conducting so-called "psychological warfare." In July alone, there were 277 cases of reactionary rumors in the city. They created various accidents, sabotaged production, and sabotaged socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, there were 253 cases of sabotage of production and suspected sabotage accidents in factories and enterprises throughout the city in 1955. They colluded with each other, attempting to incite disturbances and carry out riots. For example, Lü Baobing, a Central Statistics Bureau special agent, colluded with more than 30 counter-revolutionaries who had fled from other provinces, attempting to disguise themselves as passengers and hijack the Minsheng Company's Minzu ship to Taiwan. At the same time, he also assigned Wang Cizheng and Wang Jiachang, members of reactionary organizations, to infiltrate the Taxation Bureau, plotting to win over cooks to poison responsible cadres. They actively probed our various military, political, and economic intelligence, and attempted to find cadres who were so-called "disappointed, out of power, and out of favor" and "people with political ambitions and desires for high office and wealth" in our key departments, high-level organs, and among high-level democratic figures to carry out "defection" work. These situations show that the activities of special agent counter-revolutionaries were rampant and the situation was serious. At that time, our team was impure, the system was lax, and the right-leaning paralysis of the broad masses of cadres had grown. In response to these situations, we followed the instructions of the Central Committee and the resolution of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, and in the second half of 1955, we launched another city-wide campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and at the same time, we launched a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries within the city's organs, schools, factories, enterprises, and people's organizations.
    Counter-Revolutionary Elements Were dealt a Devastating Blow, and Great Differentiation Occurred, and Our Ranks Were Further Purified
    The achievements of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries are enormous. This struggle dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracies and sabotage of special agent counter-revolutionaries and effectively protected the progress of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Because the masses were mobilized and relied upon to fight against counter-revolutionaries, some deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries were exposed, which further eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. For example, Qiu Yusheng, a counter-revolutionary element who served as the military director and deputy commander of the pseudo-Seventh Clearing Area in 1947, formulated "anti-communist" plans in Shandong and other places, implemented the "three-all" policy, planned and directed the encirclement and suppression of our guerrillas, and killed many of our revolutionary cadres and people. He refused to confess after liberation. He was arrested according to law after investigation and verification based on reports from the people. We also actively cracked down on imperialist Chiang Kai-shek special agent spies, solved a number of cases, and timely thwarted counter-revolutionary conspiracies. For example, in October 1956, the enemy prepared to create a large-scale terrorist riot in Guangzhou to coordinate with their riots in Kowloon. They successively dispatched a group of trained special agent elements and smuggled a batch of American-made time bombs, various explosives, and a large number of reactionary leaflets, conspiring to carry out sabotage in more than 40 places including major theaters, teahouses, hotels, parks, department stores, oil depots, and stations before and after the National Day. Among them, Wu Man'an, Mai Zhong, Chen Jin, Zhou Hanqin and other groups of special agents were responsible for bombing and burning five theaters including Zhongshan, and parks including Central, Haichuang, Yuexiu, and Haizhu; Huang Yongren, Zhou Shimin, Huang Jiu, Chen Ying and other groups of special agents distributed leaflets and posted slogans in the South District, North District and other places to incite riots. The Hong Kong special agent agency also sent special agent Huang He to carry a camera to prepare to capture photos of the bombing and riot scenes as materials for carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda. We can see that the sabotage activities of special agent counter-revolutionaries are crazy. In order to achieve their goals, they do not hesitate to take all the most despicable and vicious means. However, with the active support and cooperation of the broad masses of the city, and after meticulous investigation by the municipal public security organs, this conspiracy of the enemy was completely crushed. The enemy's special action rioters were captured, and a batch of the enemy's time bombs, incendiary devices, yellow explosives, and thousands of reactionary leaflets were seized, giving a devastating blow to this group of action sabotage special agents.
    The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries launched by the masses within the organs also ferreted out a group of hidden counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, some of whom had already infiltrated our leading and key departments, and a few even seized leading positions. The internal hidden counter-revolutionaries echoed the special agent elements in society and also carried out various conspiracies and sabotage. For example, Lian Rusong of the North District Taxation Bureau was bought by a special agent element who sneaked back to Guangzhou from Hong Kong in December 1955 and joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee" special agent organization. In early 1956, he secretly wrote intelligence three times and sent it to the Hong Kong special agent agency. Pan Chu, a special agent element who was a cook in the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, collected relevant military intelligence and information about the organization and personnel of the organ and provided it to the Hong Kong special agent agency. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement ferreted out these hidden enemies, eliminated hidden dangers, and further purified our ranks.
    The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries showed the great strength of the people, embodied the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, and also promoted the further disintegration and collapse of the enemy. Under the appeal of the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, meritorious service for atonement, and rewards for great meritorious service," counter-revolutionaries surrendered themselves to the government one after another. In 1955, 177 counter-revolutionaries came to surrender themselves, and in 1956 alone, there were another 210. Among the counter-revolutionaries who surrendered themselves, there were not only a batch of historical counter-revolutionaries with serious crimes and blood debts, but also active special agent elements. For urban residual counter-revolutionaries (including those who surrendered themselves), we followed the "Decision on the Leniency and Resettlement of Urban Residual Counter-Revolutionaries" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and gave lenient treatment. Most of the reformed elements have been granted civil rights, and some have been resettled for employment. The counter-revolutionaries who received lenient treatment generally expressed gratitude to the government. This played a great role in disintegrating and winning over the transformation of counter-revolutionaries.
    In the Struggle to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries, the Masses Showed a High Degree of Fighting Enthusiasm
    The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries further raised the political consciousness, revolutionary vigilance, and ability to identify counter-revolutionaries of the masses. In the past two years, citizens have reported 5,997 pieces of information on counter-revolutionaries and suspected counter-revolutionaries. After investigation by the public security organs, it was confirmed that 199 people were counter-revolutionaries who needed to be arrested according to law. In the security work around the National Day last year, the high enthusiasm of the broad masses in fighting against special agents was fully demonstrated. They not only actively participated in the work of duty, patrol, prevention and protection, but also took the initiative to report, monitor, and track counter-revolutionaries, assisting the public security organs in attacking the enemy. In this more than one-month struggle, there were six cases solved due to mass reports alone, and seven special agents were arrested according to law. For example, Liang Wanwen, an elderly woman nearly 60 years old, and Liu Gui, a woman with eye disease, in the North District discovered special agents distributing reactionary leaflets on the evening of October 10 last year. They automatically tracked them to their residence and reported to the police station, thus solving the case. Some people were unwilling for their relatives to betray the motherland and harm the people, and reported to the government. For example, an employee of a large restaurant in the Central District reported that his cousin conspired to develop him to join a special agent organization. After investigation, three active special agents were arrested; Wang, a worker in the Workers' New Village in the East District, found his aunt suspicious after she returned from Hong Kong, so he reported to the police station. The result of the investigation was that his aunt was an active special agent element.
    Based on the above situation alone, it is sufficient to show that the achievements of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries launched in Guangzhou since 1955 are enormous. The result of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and social order became more stable, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the city's socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    Even Individual and Local Shortcomings and Mistakes, We Do Not Conceal
    We affirm that achievements are the main thing, but we do not conceal shortcomings and mistakes. In the fierce struggle of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, a few good people were wrongly arrested, and a very small number of people who could have been arrested or not were arrested. From the perspective of policy, this is a shortcoming; in the initial stage of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries within the organs, the scope of struggle in some units was wider, and a small number of good people were wrongly struggled against. After the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, some units did not solve some remaining problems in a timely and proper manner. At the same time, there were still some counter-revolutionaries who escaped the net. Some of these shortcomings are difficult to avoid in such a complex struggle. Moreover, the above-mentioned shortcomings and mistakes are local and temporary, and can be corrected. In fact, they have been corrected and are being corrected. We have organized many case review and inspections, and various units have also carried out re-examination of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries work. The results of the case inspection prove that the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries since 1955 is healthy and correct. The good people who were wrongly arrested are individual cases, and they have all been seriously corrected and handled. For the good people who were wrongly arrested and struggled against, a review was made to them, admitting mistakes, restoring their reputation, and most of the people who had jobs have been reinstated; those who have financial difficulties are given appropriate social relief. For example, in April last year, the West District Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau wrongly arrested Feng Yuan, a member of the masses who had reported counter-revolutionaries, due to insufficient investigation of the materials and believing in the reporting materials. After discovering this in May last year, he was released immediately, publicly apologized to the masses, restored his reputation, and gave material compensation. Feng Yuan expressed satisfaction and worked actively, often saying: "The government's handling is correct."
    There Are Still Counter-Revolutionaries, We Must Be Vigilant
    Now the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated, and there has been new development in the disintegration of counter-revolutionary elements. However, there are still a few hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated and will still take the opportunity to make trouble. In addition, Guangzhou is a border city, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao. Imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek group will continue to send special agents to sneak in to carry out sabotage activities. For example, on the evening of June 7 this year, special agent Long Peiqiang carried an American-made time bomb and placed it in Guangzhou Cultural Park, attempting to kill a large number of visiting masses (discovered by the masses and arrested by public security personnel on the spot, the bomb did not explode), which is a vivid example. In addition to actively preparing for action and sabotage, the enemy is also actively carrying out "defection" activities and collecting various intelligence, especially military intelligence, and extensively launching "psychological warfare" activities, attempting to provoke so-called mass "anti-violent movements." These situations show that we must be vigilant. Therefore, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions: No matter where counter-revolutionaries appear to make trouble, they should be resolutely eliminated.
    From this, it can be seen that the right-wing elements say that the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been done very badly and there are great deviations, which is completely unfounded. This is nothing more than because they are flesh and blood connected with counter-revolutionaries, share the same breath, feel sorry for each other, and mourn their kind, and issue intentional curses.
    What Kind of Dirty Deeds Did Huang Shaohong Do in Guangzhou?
    Now let us see how Huang Shaohong, who is the most rampant in attacking the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, finds a basis for his reactionary remarks. Huang came to Guangzhou on December 18 last year and stayed for a total of eight days. During the inspection, he was most enthusiastic about picking faults in the errors in the implementation of the legal system by the political and legal departments, and wanted to find illegal materials from the public security organs in all aspects. The public security department tried to report its work to him, but Huang expressed his unwillingness to listen. He was unwilling to listen to the overall work situation, only looking for faults and wrong cases, only seeing the trees and not the forest. Originally, what he wanted were these individual deviations and individual mistakes. He added them up and exaggerated them into comprehensive and serious mistakes as "materials" for attacking the Party, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship.
    How did Huang Shaohong use his status as a people's representative to instigate criminals to "seek redress" in inspection work? The following dialogue is proof.
    When Huang Shaohong inspected the first detention center and interrogated Zhuang Xuan, a special agent element sent by overseas special agent agencies, he asked: "Do you know Huang Shaohong?" The Zhuang criminal nodded to indicate that he knew.
    Huang said: "I am also a member of the Kuomintang. If you have any ideological problems, you can tell me what you see on the mainland and what is wrong with the Communist Party."
    Huang Shaohong stood on the position of the Kuomintang reactionaries and encouraged counter-revolutionary elements to talk badly about the Communist Party in order to accumulate "materials" and prepare to attack the Communist Party.
    Representatives, this is the true face of Huang Shaohong! This is Huang Shaohong's position! This is Huang Shaohong's activity!
    Right-wing elements such as Huang Shaohong deliberately obliterate the achievements of various tasks, exaggerate mistakes, and say that it is pitch black and there is no light, vainly attempting to incite the people to oppose the Communist Party, sabotage socialism, and restore capitalism, which is obviously a futile attempt. The people of Guangzhou will always remember that one of the important reasons for the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising in 1927 was the failure to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries. As a result, thousands of revolutionaries and the people were slaughtered by counter-revolutionaries. We will not forget the lessons of history, nor will we forget this blood debt! We must give severe suppression to any counter-revolutionary activities. We will resolutely fight back against the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements. We must further consolidate the leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and strive to completely complete socialist transformation and socialist construction!

    肃反成绩是不容怀疑的
    朱光的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和大会的各项报告。
    一九五六年广州市和全国一样，社会主义改造和社会主义建设都取得了伟大的胜利，基本上改变了广州市的面貌。同样，在肃反工作中也取得了巨大的成绩。右派分子企图抹煞我国几年来的光辉成就，尤其是对肃反工作肆意诬蔑，因此，我就广州市一九五五年以来肃反工作的情况作一个发言。
    开展肃反斗争是适应国家和人民的需要
    一九五五年展开肃反斗争，是完全必要的。当时正处在社会主义革命高潮的前夕，广州市人民和全国人民一起，在为争取社会主义革命胜利而斗争。但是，残余的反革命分子和帝国主义、蒋介石集团的特务分子，却积极进行各种破坏活动。他们针对社会主义改造的各项措施，进行造谣，涂写反动标语，进行所谓“心理作战”，仅七月份一个月内，全市发生的反动谣言就有二百七十七宗。他们制造各种事故，破坏生产，破坏社会主义建设，据不完全统计，一九五五年全市工厂企业发生破坏生产和破坏嫌疑事故二百五十三件。他们互相纠合，企图煽动骚乱，进行暴乱，例如中统特务吕薄冰纠合外省逃亡的反革命分子三十余人，企图伪装乘客劫夺民生公司的民俗轮驶去台湾；同时又指派反动组织成员王慈正、王家昌混入税务局，图谋拉拢炊事员毒杀负责干部。他们积极刺探我各种军事、政治、经济情报，并企图在我要害部门、高级机关、高级民主人士中，寻找所谓“失意、失势、失宠”的干部及“有政治野心和高官厚爵欲望的人”，进行“策反”。这些情况说明，特务反革命分子的活动是猖獗的，情况也是严重的。而当时我们的队伍内部不纯，制度松弛，广大干部右倾麻痹思想有所滋长。针对这些情况，我们遵照中央的指示和第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的决议，在一九五五年下半年又发动了一次全市规模的镇反运动，同时在全市机关、学校、工厂、企业、人民团体内部，开展了肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争。
    反革命分子受到摧毁性的打击，起了很大分化，我们的队伍也进一步纯洁了
    肃反斗争的成绩是巨大的。这一斗争沉重地打击了特务反革命分子的阴谋破坏，有效地保卫了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的进行。由于发动并依靠了群众与反革命分子进行斗争，一些隐蔽的较深的反革命分子被揭露出来了，这就进一步肃清了残余的反革命势力。例如曾在一九四七年任伪第七清剿区军事处长及副司令的反革命分子丘宇生，他在山东等地制订“反共”计划，执行“三光”政策，主谋策划围剿我游击队，杀害我革命干部、群众多人，解放后拒不坦白，就是在人民群众检举下，经调查证实依法逮捕了。我们还积极地打击了帝国主义蒋介石特务间谍，侦破了一批案件，及时粉碎反革命阴谋活动。如一九五六年十月，敌人准备在广州制造大规模恐怖骚乱事件，以配合他们在九龙的暴乱，陆续派遣了一批经过训练的特务分子和偷运了一批美制定时炸弹、各种炸药及大批反动传单，阴谋于国庆节前后在主要戏院、茶楼、旅店、公园、百货公司、油库、车站等四十多处进行破坏。其中吴满安、麦忠、陈金、周汉勤等几批特务负责爆炸和焚烧中山等五家戏院，中央、海幢、越秀、海珠等公园；黄永仁、周世民、黄就、陈英等几批特务在南区、北区等处散发传单，张贴标语，煽动骚乱。香港特务机关并派遣特务黄合携带照相机准备摄取爆破和骚乱的现场照片，作为进行反革命宣传的资料。我们可以看到，特务反革命分子的破坏活动是疯狂的，他们为了达到目的，不惜采取一切最卑鄙最狠毒的手段。但在全市广大群众积极支持和配合下，经过市公安机关缜密的侦察，完全粉碎了敌特的这一阴谋，捕获了敌特行动暴乱凶手，缴获了一批敌特的定时炸弹、纵火器、黄色炸药和数以千计的反动传单，给了这批行动破坏特务以摧毁性的打击。
    机关内部发动群众展开的肃反斗争，也清查出一批暗藏的反革命分子和其他坏分子，其中有的已经钻进了我们的首脑要害部门，个别的甚至窃踞了领导工作岗位。内部暗藏的反革命分子同社会上的特务分子相呼应，也进行了各种阴谋破坏。例如北区税务分局练儒松，一九五五年十二月被由香港潜返广州活动的特务分子所收买，参加了国民党“中委会”特务组织，一九五六年初先后三次密写情报送给香港特务机关。在中共广州市委会当炊事员的特务分子潘初，曾搜集了有关军事情报及机关组织人员情况供给香港特务机关。肃反运动把这些暗藏的敌人清查出来，消除了心腹隐患，进一步纯洁了我们的队伍。
    肃反运动显示了人民群众的伟大力量，体现了人民民主专政的威力，也促进了敌人进一步分化瓦解。在“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”政策的感召下，反革命分子纷纷向政府投案自首。一九五五年反革命分子前来投案自首的有一百七十七名，一九五六年一年又有二百一十名。投案自首的反革命分子中，不仅有一批罪恶严重的有血债的历史反革命分子，而且有现行特务分子。对于城市残余反革命分子（包括投案自首分子），我们遵照人大常委会通过的“关于宽大处理和安置城市残余反革命分子的决定”，给予从宽处理。已被改造好的分子，大多数获得了公民权利，并有一部分得到了安置就业。获得宽大处理的反革命分子对政府普遍表示感激。这对分化瓦解和争取改造反革命分子起了很大的作用。
    在肃反斗争中，群众发挥高度的斗争积极性
    肃反斗争进一步提高了群众的政治觉悟、革命警惕和识别反革命的能力。两年来，市民检举了反革命和反革命嫌疑分子的材料五千九百九十七件，经公安机关侦察证实确是反革命分子需要依法逮捕的就有一百九十九名，在去年国庆节前后的保卫工作中，更充分显现出广大群众反特斗争的高度积极性，他们不只积极参加了值班、巡逻、防范保卫的工作，并且主动检举、监视、跟踪反革命分子，协助公安机关打击敌人，在这场一个多月的斗争中，光是由于群众检举而破案的就有六起，依法逮捕了特务七人。如北区有一个年近六十岁的老太太梁婉文和一个有眼病的妇女刘贵，在去年十月十日晚上发现了散发反动传单的特务，自动跟踪到其住地后报告派出所，因而破案，有的群众不愿自己的亲人出卖祖国，危害人民，向政府检举，如中区某大酒家的职工检举其堂弟阴谋发展他参加特务组织，经侦察后捕了三名现行特务；东区工人新村工人王某，发现其姨由香港回来后，行动可疑，便到派出所检举，侦察结果，其姨是一个现行特务分子。
    仅就上述情况，已可以充分说明一九五五年以来在广州市开展的肃反斗争成绩是巨大的。肃反运动的结果，进一步巩固了人民民主专政，社会秩序更加安定，从而保障了全市社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    即使是个别的局部的缺点和错误，我们也不掩饰
    我们肯定成绩是主要的，但我们并不掩盖缺点和错误。在肃反运动的激烈斗争中，曾经错捕了个别好人，也捕过极少数可捕可不捕的人，这就政策上来检查是有缺点的；在机关内部肃反斗争初期，有些单位的斗争面宽了一些，斗错了少数好人，有些单位在肃反运动以后，对若干遗留问题没有及时妥善解决。同时也还有一些反革命分子漏网。这些缺点，有些是在这样一场复杂的斗争中难以避免的。而且，上述的缺点和错误是局部的、暂时的，是可以纠正的，事实上是已经纠正和正在纠正中。我们组织了多次清案检查，各单位也进行了肃反复查工作。案件检查结果证明，一九五五年以来的肃反运动是健康的、正确的，捕错的好人是个别的，并都已认真作了纠正和处理。对于被错捕错斗的好人，向其作了检讨，承认错误，恢复其名誉，原来有职业的人，大多数已复职；生活有困难的，给予适当的社会救济。例如去年四月市公安局西区分局因调查材料不深入，轻信检举材料，错捕了一个曾经检举过反革命分子的群众冯源，于去年五月间发现后，即行释放，在群众中公开道歉，恢复其名誉，给予了物质上的补偿。冯源表示满意，工作积极，常说：“政府这样处理是对的。”
    反革命分子仍然有，我们必须提高警惕
    现在残余的反革命势力已经基本肃清，反革命分子内部的分化有了新的发展。但是，还有少数没有肃清的暗藏的反革命分子仍会伺机捣乱。加以广州是边沿城市，毗邻港澳，帝国主义者和蒋介石集团必将继续派遣特务潜入进行破坏活动，如今年六月七日晚特务龙沛强携带美制定时炸弹投放在广州文化公园，企图大量杀伤参观群众（经群众发觉，当场由公安人员逮捕，炸弹未爆），就是活生生的例证。敌人除了积极准备行动破坏外，还积极进行“策反”活动和搜集各种情报，特别是军事情报以及广泛展开“心理作战”的活动，妄想挑拨起所谓群众性的“抗暴运动”。这些情况说明，我们必须提高警惕。因此必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席的指示：不管什么地方出现反革命分子捣乱，就应当坚决消灭他。
    由此可见，那些右派分子说肃反运动搞得很糟，偏差很大，是毫无根据的，这不外是由于他们和反革命分子血肉相连，声气相通，兔死狐悲，物伤其类，而发出别有用心的诅咒罢了。
    黄绍竑在广州干了些什么勾当
    现在让我们看看攻击肃反运动表现得最猖狂的黄绍竑是怎样为他的反动言论找根据的吧。去年十二月十八日，黄来到广州，共住了八天。在视察中，他最热中于挑剔政法各部门在执行法制方面的错误，并想从各方面寻找公安机关的违法材料，公安部门争取向其汇报工作，黄却表示不愿听取。他不愿听取全面的工作情况，专找岔子，找错案，只看树木，不看森林。原来他要的就是这些个别的偏差，个别的错误，把它加起来，并加以夸大，说成是全面的严重错误，作为向党、向社会主义、向人民民主专政进攻的“材料”。
    黄绍竑是怎样利用人民代表的身份，在视察工作中煽动罪犯“伸冤”的呢？有下列对话为证。
    黄绍竑在视察第一看守所提审海外特务机关派遣进来的特务分子庄玄时，问：“你认得不认得黄绍竑？”庄犯点头表示知道。
    黄说：“我也是国民党的人，你有什么思想搞不通的，你看到了大陆各方面，共产党有什么不好，可以告诉我。”
    黄绍竑就是站在国民党反动派的立场，鼓励反革命分子讲共产党的坏话，以便积累“材料”，准备向共产党进攻。
    代表们，这就是黄绍竑的真面目！这就是黄绍竑的立场！这就是黄绍竑的活动！
    黄绍竑等右派分子存心抹煞各项工作的成绩，夸大错误，说成漆黑一团，暗无天日，妄图煽动人民反对共产党，破坏社会主义，恢复资本主义，显然是白费心机的。广州市人民永远记得，一九二七年广州起义之所以失败，一个重要的原因是没有坚决彻底肃清反革命，结果几千革命者和人民群众遭受了反革命的屠杀，我们不会忘记历史的教训，也不会忘记这笔血债！对任何反革命活动，我们必须给以严厉镇压。对于右派分子的猖狂进攻，我们坚决予以回击。我们必须进一步巩固中国共产党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，为彻底完成社会主义改造和社会主义建设而奋斗！
