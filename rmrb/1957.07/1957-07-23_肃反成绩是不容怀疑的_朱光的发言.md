    The Achievements of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Are Beyond Doubt
    Zhu Guang's Speech
    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and all the reports of the conference.
    In 1956, Guangzhou, like the rest of the country, achieved great victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction, fundamentally changing the face of Guangzhou. Similarly, in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, tremendous achievements were also made. Right-wing elements attempt to obliterate our country's glorious achievements over the past few years, especially by wantonly slandering the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, I will make a speech on the situation of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Guangzhou since 1955.
    The Launching of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Struggle Was to Meet the Needs of the State and the People
    It was absolutely necessary to launch the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1955. At that time, we were on the eve of the high tide of the socialist revolution. The people of Guangzhou, along with the people of the whole country, were fighting for the victory of the socialist revolution. However, the remaining counter-revolutionaries and the special agents of the imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek groups were actively carrying out various sabotage activities. They targeted the various measures of socialist transformation, spreading rumors, writing reactionary slogans, and conducting so-called "psychological warfare." In July alone, there were 277 cases of reactionary rumors in the city. They created various accidents, sabotaged production, and sabotaged socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, there were 253 cases of sabotage of production and suspected sabotage accidents in factories and enterprises throughout the city in 1955. They colluded with each other, attempting to incite disturbances and carry out riots. For example, LÃ¼ Baobing, a Central Statistics Bureau special agent, colluded with more than 30 counter-revolutionaries who had fled from other provinces, attempting to disguise themselves as passengers and hijack the Minsheng Company's Minzu ship to Taiwan. At the same time, he also assigned Wang Cizheng and Wang Jiachang, members of reactionary organizations, to infiltrate the Taxation Bureau, plotting to win over cooks to poison responsible cadres. They actively probed our various military, political, and economic intelligence, and attempted to find cadres who were so-called "disappointed, out of power, and out of favor" and "people with political ambitions and desires for high office and wealth" in our key departments, high-level organs, and among high-level democratic figures to carry out "defection" work. These situations show that the activities of special agent counter-revolutionaries were rampant and the situation was serious. At that time, our team was impure, the system was lax, and the right-leaning paralysis of the broad masses of cadres had grown. In response to these situations, we followed the instructions of the Central Committee and the resolution of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, and in the second half of 1955, we launched another city-wide campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and at the same time, we launched a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries within the city's organs, schools, factories, enterprises, and people's organizations.
    Counter-Revolutionary Elements Were dealt a Devastating Blow, and Great Differentiation Occurred, and Our Ranks Were Further Purified
    The achievements of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries are enormous. This struggle dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracies and sabotage of special agent counter-revolutionaries and effectively protected the progress of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Because the masses were mobilized and relied upon to fight against counter-revolutionaries, some deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries were exposed, which further eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. For example, Qiu Yusheng, a counter-revolutionary element who served as the military director and deputy commander of the pseudo-Seventh Clearing Area in 1947, formulated "anti-communist" plans in Shandong and other places, implemented the "three-all" policy, planned and directed the encirclement and suppression of our guerrillas, and killed many of our revolutionary cadres and people. He refused to confess after liberation. He was arrested according to law after investigation and verification based on reports from the people. We also actively cracked down on imperialist Chiang Kai-shek special agent spies, solved a number of cases, and timely thwarted counter-revolutionary conspiracies. For example, in October 1956, the enemy prepared to create a large-scale terrorist riot in Guangzhou to coordinate with their riots in Kowloon. They successively dispatched a group of trained special agent elements and smuggled a batch of American-made time bombs, various explosives, and a large number of reactionary leaflets, conspiring to carry out sabotage in more than 40 places including major theaters, teahouses, hotels, parks, department stores, oil depots, and stations before and after the National Day. Among them, Wu Man'an, Mai Zhong, Chen Jin, Zhou Hanqin and other groups of special agents were responsible for bombing and burning five theaters including Zhongshan, and parks including Central, Haichuang, Yuexiu, and Haizhu; Huang Yongren, Zhou Shimin, Huang Jiu, Chen Ying and other groups of special agents distributed leaflets and posted slogans in the South District, North District and other places to incite riots. The Hong Kong special agent agency also sent special agent Huang He to carry a camera to prepare to capture photos of the bombing and riot scenes as materials for carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda. We can see that the sabotage activities of special agent counter-revolutionaries are crazy. In order to achieve their goals, they do not hesitate to take all the most despicable and vicious means. However, with the active support and cooperation of the broad masses of the city, and after meticulous investigation by the municipal public security organs, this conspiracy of the enemy was completely crushed. The enemy's special action rioters were captured, and a batch of the enemy's time bombs, incendiary devices, yellow explosives, and thousands of reactionary leaflets were seized, giving a devastating blow to this group of action sabotage special agents.
    The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries launched by the masses within the organs also ferreted out a group of hidden counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, some of whom had already infiltrated our leading and key departments, and a few even seized leading positions. The internal hidden counter-revolutionaries echoed the special agent elements in society and also carried out various conspiracies and sabotage. For example, Lian Rusong of the North District Taxation Bureau was bought by a special agent element who sneaked back to Guangzhou from Hong Kong in December 1955 and joined the Kuomintang "Central Committee" special agent organization. In early 1956, he secretly wrote intelligence three times and sent it to the Hong Kong special agent agency. Pan Chu, a special agent element who was a cook in the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, collected relevant military intelligence and information about the organization and personnel of the organ and provided it to the Hong Kong special agent agency. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement ferreted out these hidden enemies, eliminated hidden dangers, and further purified our ranks.
    The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries showed the great strength of the people, embodied the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, and also promoted the further disintegration and collapse of the enemy. Under the appeal of the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, meritorious service for atonement, and rewards for great meritorious service," counter-revolutionaries surrendered themselves to the government one after another. In 1955, 177 counter-revolutionaries came to surrender themselves, and in 1956 alone, there were another 210. Among the counter-revolutionaries who surrendered themselves, there were not only a batch of historical counter-revolutionaries with serious crimes and blood debts, but also active special agent elements. For urban residual counter-revolutionaries (including those who surrendered themselves), we followed the "Decision on the Leniency and Resettlement of Urban Residual Counter-Revolutionaries" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and gave lenient treatment. Most of the reformed elements have been granted civil rights, and some have been resettled for employment. The counter-revolutionaries who received lenient treatment generally expressed gratitude to the government. This played a great role in disintegrating and winning over the transformation of counter-revolutionaries.
    In the Struggle to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries, the Masses Showed a High Degree of Fighting Enthusiasm
    The struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries further raised the political consciousness, revolutionary vigilance, and ability to identify counter-revolutionaries of the masses. In the past two years, citizens have reported 5,997 pieces of information on counter-revolutionaries and suspected counter-revolutionaries. After investigation by the public security organs, it was confirmed that 199 people were counter-revolutionaries who needed to be arrested according to law. In the security work around the National Day last year, the high enthusiasm of the broad masses in fighting against special agents was fully demonstrated. They not only actively participated in the work of duty, patrol, prevention and protection, but also took the initiative to report, monitor, and track counter-revolutionaries, assisting the public security organs in attacking the enemy. In this more than one-month struggle, there were six cases solved due to mass reports alone, and seven special agents were arrested according to law. For example, Liang Wanwen, an elderly woman nearly 60 years old, and Liu Gui, a woman with eye disease, in the North District discovered special agents distributing reactionary leaflets on the evening of October 10 last year. They automatically tracked them to their residence and reported to the police station, thus solving the case. Some people were unwilling for their relatives to betray the motherland and harm the people, and reported to the government. For example, an employee of a large restaurant in the Central District reported that his cousin conspired to develop him to join a special agent organization. After investigation, three active special agents were arrested; Wang, a worker in the Workers' New Village in the East District, found his aunt suspicious after she returned from Hong Kong, so he reported to the police station. The result of the investigation was that his aunt was an active special agent element.
    Based on the above situation alone, it is sufficient to show that the achievements of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries launched in Guangzhou since 1955 are enormous. The result of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and social order became more stable, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the city's socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    Even Individual and Local Shortcomings and Mistakes, We Do Not Conceal
    We affirm that achievements are the main thing, but we do not conceal shortcomings and mistakes. In the fierce struggle of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, a few good people were wrongly arrested, and a very small number of people who could have been arrested or not were arrested. From the perspective of policy, this is a shortcoming; in the initial stage of the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries within the organs, the scope of struggle in some units was wider, and a small number of good people were wrongly struggled against. After the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, some units did not solve some remaining problems in a timely and proper manner. At the same time, there were still some counter-revolutionaries who escaped the net. Some of these shortcomings are difficult to avoid in such a complex struggle. Moreover, the above-mentioned shortcomings and mistakes are local and temporary, and can be corrected. In fact, they have been corrected and are being corrected. We have organized many case review and inspections, and various units have also carried out re-examination of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries work. The results of the case inspection prove that the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries since 1955 is healthy and correct. The good people who were wrongly arrested are individual cases, and they have all been seriously corrected and handled. For the good people who were wrongly arrested and struggled against, a review was made to them, admitting mistakes, restoring their reputation, and most of the people who had jobs have been reinstated; those who have financial difficulties are given appropriate social relief. For example, in April last year, the West District Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau wrongly arrested Feng Yuan, a member of the masses who had reported counter-revolutionaries, due to insufficient investigation of the materials and believing in the reporting materials. After discovering this in May last year, he was released immediately, publicly apologized to the masses, restored his reputation, and gave material compensation. Feng Yuan expressed satisfaction and worked actively, often saying: "The government's handling is correct."
    There Are Still Counter-Revolutionaries, We Must Be Vigilant
    Now the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated, and there has been new development in the disintegration of counter-revolutionary elements. However, there are still a few hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated and will still take the opportunity to make trouble. In addition, Guangzhou is a border city, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao. Imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek group will continue to send special agents to sneak in to carry out sabotage activities. For example, on the evening of June 7 this year, special agent Long Peiqiang carried an American-made time bomb and placed it in Guangzhou Cultural Park, attempting to kill a large number of visiting masses (discovered by the masses and arrested by public security personnel on the spot, the bomb did not explode), which is a vivid example. In addition to actively preparing for action and sabotage, the enemy is also actively carrying out "defection" activities and collecting various intelligence, especially military intelligence, and extensively launching "psychological warfare" activities, attempting to provoke so-called mass "anti-violent movements." These situations show that we must be vigilant. Therefore, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions: No matter where counter-revolutionaries appear to make trouble, they should be resolutely eliminated.
    From this, it can be seen that the right-wing elements say that the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been done very badly and there are great deviations, which is completely unfounded. This is nothing more than because they are flesh and blood connected with counter-revolutionaries, share the same breath, feel sorry for each other, and mourn their kind, and issue intentional curses.
    What Kind of Dirty Deeds Did Huang Shaohong Do in Guangzhou?
    Now let us see how Huang Shaohong, who is the most rampant in attacking the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, finds a basis for his reactionary remarks. Huang came to Guangzhou on December 18 last year and stayed for a total of eight days. During the inspection, he was most enthusiastic about picking faults in the errors in the implementation of the legal system by the political and legal departments, and wanted to find illegal materials from the public security organs in all aspects. The public security department tried to report its work to him, but Huang expressed his unwillingness to listen. He was unwilling to listen to the overall work situation, only looking for faults and wrong cases, only seeing the trees and not the forest. Originally, what he wanted were these individual deviations and individual mistakes. He added them up and exaggerated them into comprehensive and serious mistakes as "materials" for attacking the Party, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship.
    How did Huang Shaohong use his status as a people's representative to instigate criminals to "seek redress" in inspection work? The following dialogue is proof.
    When Huang Shaohong inspected the first detention center and interrogated Zhuang Xuan, a special agent element sent by overseas special agent agencies, he asked: "Do you know Huang Shaohong?" The Zhuang criminal nodded to indicate that he knew.
    Huang said: "I am also a member of the Kuomintang. If you have any ideological problems, you can tell me what you see on the mainland and what is wrong with the Communist Party."
    Huang Shaohong stood on the position of the Kuomintang reactionaries and encouraged counter-revolutionary elements to talk badly about the Communist Party in order to accumulate "materials" and prepare to attack the Communist Party.
    Representatives, this is the true face of Huang Shaohong! This is Huang Shaohong's position! This is Huang Shaohong's activity!
    Right-wing elements such as Huang Shaohong deliberately obliterate the achievements of various tasks, exaggerate mistakes, and say that it is pitch black and there is no light, vainly attempting to incite the people to oppose the Communist Party, sabotage socialism, and restore capitalism, which is obviously a futile attempt. The people of Guangzhou will always remember that one of the important reasons for the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising in 1927 was the failure to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries. As a result, thousands of revolutionaries and the people were slaughtered by counter-revolutionaries. We will not forget the lessons of history, nor will we forget this blood debt! We must give severe suppression to any counter-revolutionary activities. We will resolutely fight back against the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements. We must further consolidate the leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and strive to completely complete socialist transformation and socialist construction!
