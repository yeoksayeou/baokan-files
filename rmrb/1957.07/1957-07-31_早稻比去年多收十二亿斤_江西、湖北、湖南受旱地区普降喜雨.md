According to preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total national yield of early rice this year may reach over 39.6 billion jin, an increase of approximately 1.2 billion jin compared to the bumper year of 1956. The yield per unit area of early rice may reach approximately 330 jin, an increase of approximately 20 jin per mu compared to the bumper year of 1956.

This year, many provinces have adjusted the planting area for early rice. In Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, and Guangxi, the planting area for early rice has decreased compared to last year due to the restoration of some double-cropping rice to single-cropping rice. Although the yield per unit area of early rice in these provinces has increased, the total yield has not reached last year's level, decreasing by over 1.9 billion jin. In Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan, the total yield has increased to varying degrees compared to last year due to the expansion of the planting area for early rice and the implementation of various technical measures. The five provinces together produced over 3.19 billion jin more than last year. Although the spring temperature in Sichuan province was low this year and the growth and development of early rice was slow, the widespread use of the "Nante No. 1" improved variety, the implementation of advanced experiences such as early planting, close planting, shallow water irrigation, and heavy application of base fertilizer, resulted in a general bumper harvest of early rice. This province alone produced about 1.9 billion jin more rice than last year, with a total output of over 4.78 billion jin.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Welcome rain has fallen in drought-stricken areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces.

From the 26th to the 28th, precipitation in Shangrao and Jiujiang prefectures of Jiangxi province exceeded 50 millimeters, and over 20 millimeters of rain fell in the more severely drought-stricken Jian, Nanchang and Fuzhou prefectures. Since the 29th, Hubei province has generally received welcome rain, and the drought situation in the three prefectures of Huanggang, Jingzhou, and Xiaogan, which were more severely affected by the drought, has been basically alleviated. Light rain continues intermittently on the 30th. In the northern part of Hunan and various parts of southwestern Hunan, rain has fallen successively recently. In Changde Prefecture, the northern part of Qianyang Prefecture, the northeastern part of Xiangtan Prefecture, and the area of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the rainfall ranged from 50 to 143 millimeters.

Prior to this rain, there had been no rainfall in various parts of Jiangxi province for four to fifty days, presenting varying degrees of drought. Some areas of Hubei and Hunan provinces had not received rain for a long time, and the drought situation was very serious. After this rain, Jiangxi farmers are seizing the opportunity to store and conserve water after the rain, and are rushing to harvest early rice and plant late rice, late soybeans, sweet potatoes, sesame and other miscellaneous grain crops. The middle rice that has already headed in Hubei can be guaranteed a bumper harvest, the second season late rice that is being transplanted has sufficient transplanting water, and the first season late japonica rice also has fields full of water. With this abundant rain, cotton growth will be more vigorous.

At present, the drought situation in some areas of Hunan province has been alleviated or improved, while other areas are still continuing their efforts to fight the drought.

    早稻比去年多收十二亿斤
    江西、湖北、湖南受旱地区普降喜雨
    本报讯　根据农业部的初步估计，今年全国早稻的总产量可以达到三百九十六亿多斤，比丰收的1956年增加十二亿斤左右；早稻的单位面积产量可以达到三百三十斤左右，比丰收的1956年每亩提高二十斤左右。
    今年许多省都调整了早稻播种面积。江苏、安徽、福建、湖南和广西等五省，由于把部分双季稻恢复为单季稻，早稻的播种面积比去年减少，虽然这些省份的早稻单位产量有所增加，但是总产量没有达到去年的水平，比去年减少了十九亿多斤。浙江、湖北、江西、广东和四川五省，由于扩大了早稻的播种面积和贯彻执行了各种技术措施，总产量都比去年有不同程度的增加。五个省一共比去年增产了三十一亿九千多万斤。四川省虽然今年春天气温较低，早稻生长发育缓慢，但是由于普遍采用了“南特号”良种，推行了早栽、密植、浅水灌溉和重施底肥等先进经验，因此早稻普遍丰收，光是这个省就比去年增产稻谷十九亿斤左右，总产量达到四十七亿八千多万斤。

    新华社30日讯　江西、湖北和湖南省受旱地区普降喜雨。
    26日到28日，江西省上饶、九江专区降雨在五十公厘以上，受旱较重的吉安、南昌和抚州专区也下了二十多公厘雨。湖北省从29日起普降喜雨，旱象较严重的黄冈、荆州、孝感三个专区旱象已基本解除，30日小雨仍时断时续。湖南北半部和湘西南各地最近先后落雨，常德专区和黔阳专区北部、湘潭专区东北部以及湘西苗族自治州一带，降雨量在五十到一百四十三公厘。
    在这场雨以前，江西省各地已有四、五十天未下雨，呈现程度不同的旱象。湖北和湖南两省部分地区久未下雨，旱象都很严重。这场雨后，江西农民正抓紧雨后蓄水、保水，并抢收早稻，种植晚稻、晚大豆、番薯和芝麻等杂粮作物。湖北各地已经抽穗的中稻可以保证丰收，正在赶插的二季晚稻有了充足的插秧水，一季晚粳也有满田水。棉田得这场饱雨，棉花生长将更旺盛。
    湖南省目前部分地区旱象已经解除或好转，还有些地区仍在再接再厉地与旱灾展开斗争。
