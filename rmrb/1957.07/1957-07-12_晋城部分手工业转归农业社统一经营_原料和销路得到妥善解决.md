Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 9th: Following the high tide of socialist transformation of handicraft industry last year, the handicraft industry in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, like other regions in the province, independently established handicraft cooperatives. These handicrafts were originally sideline occupations of farmers. After agricultural cooperativization, farmers had even more conditions to take care of them concurrently. However, after being separated, they crowded each other out and competed with each other, causing product backlogs. In the past, handicraft industries relied on agriculture for the supply of raw materials and animal power, but now they cannot get the support of agriculture, which has increased many difficulties.

Since last year, Jincheng County, except for retaining some handicrafts with strong artistic characteristics and those that truly need to be operated independently, has transferred forty-one handicraft cooperatives to the unified leadership and management of agricultural cooperatives in batches. Some are used as sideline production brigades of agricultural cooperatives, and some are under the leadership of agricultural cooperatives in terms of organization, with the agricultural cooperatives uniformly calculating profits and losses. Now, in this county, more than 20% of the handicraft cooperatives have seen rapid development in production after being merged into agricultural cooperatives, and issues such as raw material sources and product sales have been properly resolved. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives, because they have handicraft industries as sideline occupations, have much more flexible and convenient sources and uses of funds than in the past.

According to the analysis of the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Industry Leading Department, about half of the handicraft workers distributed in rural areas throughout the province can be merged or combined with agricultural cooperatives for production based on the experience of Jincheng County.

    晋城部分手工业转归农业社统一经营
    原料和销路得到妥善解决
    据新华社太原9日电　在去年手工业社会主义改造高潮以后，山西省晋城县乡村中的手工业，也同省内其他地区一样，单独成立了手工业合作社。过去这些手工业本来是农民的副业，农业合作化后农民更有兼顾的条件，因此在分开后反而彼此排挤，互相竞争，造成产品积压。手工业过去依靠农业供应原料和畜力，现在也得不到农业的支持，增加了许多困难。
    去年以来，晋城县除把一些工艺性较强和确需单独经营的手工业仍保持独立生产外，分批把四十一个手工业合作社转归农业社统一领导、统一经营。有的作为农业社的副业生产大队，有的在组织上归农业社领导，由农业社统一计算盈亏。现在，这个县有20％以上的手工业合作社在归并到农业社后，生产有了迅速发展，原料来源和产品销售等问题都得到妥善解决。同时，农业社因为有了手工业作为副业，在资金来源和使用上比过去灵活方便得多。
    据山西省手工业领导部门分析，全省分布在农村的手工业者约有半数可以根据晋城县的经验，同农业社合并或者结合起来生产。
