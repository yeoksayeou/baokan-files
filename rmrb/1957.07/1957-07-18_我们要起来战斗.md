    We Must Rise Up and Fight
    Yu Guangyuan
    The anti-Rightist struggle is a political struggle as well as an ideological struggle.
    Our country is currently in a great era of socialist revolution. From the perspective of the economic foundation, although the socialist transformation has achieved a basic victory, the socialist system has not yet been fully established, is not completely consolidated, and is far from perfect. In order to consolidate the victory of socialist transformation and further improve the socialist system, it is necessary to continue the ideological revolution, overcome capitalist consciousness, and develop socialist consciousness guided by Marxism-Leninism. Without such an ideological revolution, it would be impossible to build a socialist society in our country.
    This ideological struggle, aimed at overcoming capitalist consciousness and developing socialist consciousness, has been going on for many years. Since liberation, reforms in education, science, literature, art, news, publishing, and other fields, the criticism of bourgeois idealism, the advocacy of studying Marxism-Leninism and carrying out ideological remolding among intellectuals, the proposal of the "Hundred Flowers Bloom, Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, and the rectification movement, which began this year and aims to combat bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, have all been aimed at achieving this goal. Through years of ideological struggle, although the question of who will win in the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the ideological sphere has not yet been resolved, a series of victories on the ideological front have played a very significant role in ensuring the victory of socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    The bourgeois Rightists' rampant attack on Marxism aims to destroy the theoretical foundation that guides all our country's work, use the old capitalist ideology to oppose the new socialist ideology, and use the old capitalist superstructure to oppose the formation, consolidation, and perfection of the new socialist foundation. Their ultimate goal is to undermine the socialist foundation and restore capitalism.
    The Rightists' anti-socialist wishful thinking is to first seize positions one by one from the proletariat, and then carry out a complete capitalist restoration when conditions are ripe. The first batch of targets they chose, in addition to the business community, were the democratic parties, education, literature and art, journalism, science and technology, and the judiciary. That is to say, the target of their attack is first of all the cultural and educational circles, and the object of their struggle is first of all the intellectuals. And the means they adopt during this period is first of all to vigorously oppose the socialist reforms that have been implemented in the country's various tasks, especially in cultural and educational work, over the past few years, and to demand a change in the Marxist-Leninist direction of our country's various tasks. In order to achieve the goal of tampering with the Marxist-Leninist direction of national work, in addition to openly attacking Marxism, they also adopt two methods. One is to demand the "restoration" of bourgeois social science, and to demand that our country's policies and measures be based on bourgeois social science. The other is to promote revisionist theories, giving the worship of capitalist anarchy and bourgeois democracy a Marxist cloak. Both of these methods should be exposed. In particular, the latter should be paid more attention to, and its danger is even greater. And the more the Rightist ideology is disguised as Marxism, the greater its danger, because people are not easy to recognize its anti-Marxist essence.
    We must give a powerful response to the Rightists' rampant attack on Marxism. Our social science workers should actively participate in the battle. In recent years, the criticism of bourgeois idealism has been done more in philosophy, while the criticism of bourgeois social science has been done less. During this Rightist attack on Marxism, bourgeois sociology, economics, politics, education, etc. have demanded restoration, and one of the reasons why they have not immediately received a strong counterattack is that many people in society do not have a deep understanding of the reactionary nature of bourgeois social science. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and criticize the works of representative figures of bourgeois social science in our country and abroad, so that people can understand why we must adopt a fundamentally negative attitude towards bourgeois social science.
    In opposing revisionism, we also have a lot of work to do. "Revisionism or right opportunism is a bourgeois trend of thought," "What they attack is the most fundamental thing of Marxism," "It is the best assistant for the bourgeois Rightists to fight against the working class in all aspects." No matter how good revisionists are at disguising themselves, it is not difficult for us to recognize them. In Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds were put forward, and in "More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," the universal truth of Marxism has also been well summarized. These are our powerful weapons in opposing revisionism. What should be paid special attention to today is the Marxist method of class analysis. The view that the Marxist method of class analysis is outdated and no longer applicable is extremely harmful.
    "The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is a policy for promoting the development of art and the progress of science, and a policy for promoting the prosperity of socialist culture in our country." Implementing this policy is beneficial to developing socialist consciousness and overcoming capitalist consciousness. This policy will not be changed because of the anti-Rightist struggle or the criticism of bourgeois social science and revisionism. Many people who use bourgeois viewpoints to study academics are not Rightists. Whether a person belongs to the Right is determined by his political attitude, not by his academic views. Discussions among different schools of thought in science are free, and even Marxism, which has been considered the guiding ideology by most people, is allowed to be criticized by others. But we Marxists will never turn a blind eye and fail to vigorously refute anti-Marxist ideas.
    The Rightists' attack on Marxism is carried out under the guise of opposing dogmatism. They want to equate dogmatism with Marxism, which must be seen clearly and not be deceived. Dogmatism is subjectivism, not Marxism. We will not stop opposing dogmatism because of the Rightists' attack. On the contrary, precisely because dogmatism is anti-Marxist, it not only cannot defeat bourgeois social science and revisionism, but it is also harmful to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, while opposing bourgeois social science and revisionism, we must also persist in opposing dogmatism and strive to have scientific analysis and full persuasiveness in the struggle against poisonous weeds. Smashing the bourgeois Rightists' attack in the academic field is an arduous and long-term task, and we Marxists need to make unremitting efforts.

    我们要起来战斗
    于光远
    反右派斗争是政治斗争同时也是思想斗争。
    目前我国还正处在一个伟大的社会主义革命的时代。从经济基础来说，社会主义改造虽已取得基本胜利，但是社会主义制度还没有完全建成，还不完全巩固，还很不完善。为了巩固社会主义改造的胜利，进一步完善社会主义制度，一定要继续进行思想上的革命，克服资本主义意识，发展以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义意识。没有这样一个思想上的革命，在我国建成社会主义社会是决不可能的。
    这个旨在克服资本主义意识，发展社会主义意识的思想斗争，已经进行了许多年。解放以来，教育、科学、文艺、新闻、出版等各方面的改革，对资产阶级唯心主义的批判，在知识分子中间提倡学习马克思列宁主义，进行思想改造，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的提出，以及今年开始的以反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义为目标的整风运动，都是为了达到这个目的。经过几年来的思想斗争，虽然还没有解决意识形态方面资产阶级和无产阶级间阶级斗争的谁胜谁负问题，但是在思想战线上一系列的胜利，对保证社会主义改造和社会主义建设的胜利，起了十分显著的作用。
    资产阶级右派对马克思主义举行猖狂进攻，目的就是企图摧毁指导我们国家各项工作的思想的理论基础，用旧的资本主义的意识形态反对新的社会主义的意识形态，用旧的资本主义的上层建筑反对新的社会主义的基础的形成、巩固和完善。他们最后的目的是破坏社会主义的基础、使资本主义复辟。
    右派反社会主义的如意算盘是首先一个一个地从无产阶级手中夺取阵地，然后在条件成熟时再来整个的资本主义复辟。他们选择的第一批对象除工商界外就是民主党派、教育界、文艺界、新闻界、科学技术界、司法界。这就是说，他们进攻的目标首先是文教界，他们争取的对象首先是知识分子。而他们在这个时期采取的手段首先便是竭力反对几年来在国家各项工作首先是文教工作中实行的社会主义改革，要求改变我们国家各项工作的马克思列宁主义方向。为了达到篡改国家工作的马克思列宁主义方向的目的，除了正面地公开对马克思主义进行攻击以外，他们还采取这样两种方法。一是要求“恢复”资产阶级的社会科学，要求我们国家的政策措施建立在资产阶级社会科学的基础之上。一是宣传修正主义的理论，给对资本主义的无政府状态和资产阶级民主的崇好，披上马克思主义的外衣。这两种手法都是应该揭穿的。尤其是后一种更加应该注意，他的危险性更大。并且右派思想装扮得越像马克思主义，它的危险性越大，因为人们不容易把它的反马克思主义的实质识别出来。
    右派对马克思主义的猖狂进攻，我们不能不给以有力的回击。我们社会科学工作者应该积极参加战斗。近几年来对资产阶级唯心主义的批判在哲学方面做得比较多，而对资产阶级社会科学的批判做得较少。在这次右派向马克思主义进攻中，资产阶级的社会学、经济学、政治学、教育学等等就纷纷要求复辟，而没有立即受到有力反击的原因之一就是社会上不少人对资产阶级社会科学的反动性，认识得还很不深刻。因此有必要对我国和外国资产阶级社会科学的代表人物的著作加以分析批判，使人们懂得为什么我们对资产阶级社会科学必须采取从原则上加以否定的态度。
    在反对修正主义方面，我们要进行的工作也是很多的。“修正主义或者右派机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮”，“他们所攻击的正是马克思主义最根本的东西”，“它是资产阶级右派从各方面向工人阶级进行斗争的最好的助手。”不论修正主义者如何善于装扮，我们还是不难把它识别出来的。在毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告中提出了区别香花毒草的六条标准，在“再论无产阶级专政历史经验”中也已经对马克思主义的普遍真理作了很好的归纳，这些都是我们在反对修正主义中的有力武器。在今天特别要引起重视的就是马克思主义关于阶级分析的方法，认为马克思主义阶级分析方法已经过时不再适用的说法，是极其有害的。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国社会主义文化繁荣的方针。”贯彻这个方针对发展社会主义意识，克服资本主义意识是有利的。这个方针决不因为开展反右派斗争或是开展对资产阶级社会科学和修正主义的批判有所改变。用资产阶级观点来研究学术的人，很多并不是右派。一个人是否属于右派，是由他的政治态度而不是由他的学术观点来决定的。科学上不同学派的讨论是自由的，甚至对已经被大多数人认为指导思想的马克思主义也允许别人对它加以批评。但是我们马克思主义者决不允许熟视无睹，不去对反马克思主义思想进行有力的驳斥。
    右派对马克思主义的攻击，是在反对教条主义的幌子下进行的。他们想在教条主义和马克思主义之间划上一个等号，这一点一定要看清楚，不要受骗。教条主义是主观主义，不是马克思主义。我们不会因为右派的进攻就不去反对教条主义。相反地，正因为教条主义是反马克思主义的，它不但无法战胜资产阶级社会科学和修正主义，而且对革命事业是有害的，所以我们在反对资产阶级社会科学和修正主义的同时，还要坚持反对教条主义，力求做到在同毒草的斗争中，有科学的分析和充分的说服力。在学术领域内粉碎资产阶级右派的进攻，是一个艰巨的长期的任务，我们马克思主义者需要进行不懈的努力。
