Title: I Hate Myself for Being a Rightist: Zhang Yunchuan's Speech

In this meeting, I studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" once again, and listened to the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. I fully support them. At the same time, thanks to the enlightenment and education of these reports, I am even more aware of my mistakes.

I am a person who has made mistakes, and I feel extremely ashamed to stand on this solemn conference podium today.

After these days of self-examination, I realize the ideological roots of my mistakes: (1) Born into a landlord family, I was influenced by the family environment in my youth, and later by the influence of Song and Ming Dynasty Neo-Confucianism. Therefore, I still retain the thoughts and feelings of the feudal landlord class. (2) After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, I joined the Third Party, and during the Anti-Japanese War, I also participated in the Democratic League. The ideology of the third line has dominated me for a very long time. (3) After liberation, I had a revolutionary burden, and often compared my position and treatment with certain people in the democratic parties, harboring individualistic ideas of fame and status. (4) Since liberation, I have not studied well, and I have not been educated and reformed in the three major transformations and five major movements. Therefore, anti-socialist ideas still exist in my mind and have not been fundamentally eliminated. In peacetime, I cannot say that I have completely turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the great achievements of the people's cause under the leadership of the Party, such as the achievements of various constructions and the improvement of international status. However, my love is not strong enough, and my sense of pride is not strong. This is a concrete manifestation of my guest mentality and resistance factors. Once my personal interests are touched, I will reveal my dissatisfaction with the Party. When studying and discussing issues, I will make anti-socialist remarks. Sometimes I even seem to hate the Party. My speech at the Central United Front Work Department symposium this time, with many anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, is just another exposure of the above-mentioned reactionary thoughts.

I am a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and also a member of the China Democratic League. In the Democratic League, I often harbor sectarian sentiments, thinking of myself as a "lone wolf," but in reality, I am completely isolated. I cannot proactively approach progressive comrades, but instead complain that they do not come to unite with me. As for Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc., I think they are trying to grab big intellectuals and engage in sectarianism. The most significant example is that at the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League, they suddenly proposed some ordinary members who were big intellectuals as members or standing committee members of the Central Committee; and even wanted to brush off some Central Committee members who had been in the Democratic League since its founding. Therefore, my feelings towards them have always been antagonistic. However, I agree with their proposition of a large-scale development and elevating the status of democratic parties (which is actually a conspiracy). Within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, etc. have always been a small clique, constantly attacking me and squeezing me out. Especially my personal feelings with Zhang Bojun have been close to breaking down in the past ten years. But he and I have always been in the same political organization for twenty-seven or eight years; before liberation, he engaged in military speculation and wanted to form a third force, and I was one of the participants in the activities; since last year, he advocated large-scale development, and I agreed; in this blooming and contending, he and I both made anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. The previous points all show that I am still the same as him in terms of ideology and politics. Because I also have anti-socialist ideological roots, I usually do not have the ability to distinguish the reactionary nature of Zhang, Luo, and others' words and deeds. I only think that they are engaged in small sectarianism and are fighting for personal rights, but I have not realized that they are a reactionary group with a program, organization, and plan, engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies.

My speech at the United Front Work Department symposium, for example, saying that "some Party members are standing on the heads of the masses, divorced from the masses," is actually a slander against Party members. Also, saying that "fake activists" are "dare-to-die corps for wall-building and ditch-digging" actually makes real activists afraid to approach the Party. At the same time, I also used many inappropriate examples to criticize the United Front work, which weakened the role of the United Front policy. Especially like all rightists, I also dislike affirming achievements first and then talking about shortcomings, which is actually obliterating achievements and emphasizing shortcomings. For example, I went to various places for inspection many times, mistakenly thinking that discovering shortcomings and reflecting them in a timely manner was the main task of the inspection; now I realize that these are all extremely serious mistakes. Furthermore, although my speech was not a planned coordination with Zhang, Luo, etc., it actually played a resonating role, cheering for them and making expanded propaganda. Because I am the Deputy Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and a National People's Congress representative, my remarks have a considerable impact among the remarks of the rightists; even Taiwan uses my words to exploit, which shows what position I am speaking from and how great the harm of my speech is. On this point, I have committed an unforgivable error.

As for Zhang Bojun, a very ambitious, specialized in observing the wind, opportunistic rogue politician, has been proven by facts revealed from all aspects. Now I will only add one point to illustrate that he consistently uses legitimate organizations to carry out illegal activities. When the Party began the rectification campaign, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party sent several groups of people to various places to develop the organization, which was part of his conspiracy. I was sent to Zhengzhou to prepare to establish the organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, which was actually executing his conspiracy. I began to say in the Henan group of the National People's Congress that I was not enthusiastic about developing the organization. In fact, if conditions permitted, I would not object to developing hundreds or thousands of people at once. From the above-mentioned points, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc., although they have always been emotionally opposed to me, are consistent in ideology and politics. After the Zhang-Luo alliance was exposed, I always thought that I was not within their group and had nothing to do with them in form. However, in essence, this view is wrong; because if their conspiracy succeeded, and they eliminated the emotional conflicts between individuals, it is very possible that I would be dragged into the reactionary mud pit by them. Speaking of this, I found that I had reached the edge of danger, and I was really shuddering!

This time, the people of the whole country launched the anti-rightist struggle, and the conspiratorial plans and ugly faces of the rightists have been revealed, giving me a head-on blow, and I began to wake up. I realize how serious the harmful role my past wrong thoughts and wrong remarks have played on the Party and socialism! I realize that the reason why I could not distinguish fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds before, and that I felt very agreeable to hear the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the rightists, is precisely because my thoughts are also rightist thoughts. I realize the root of the error in the depths of my thoughts; my wrong thoughts are objectively present, and even if they are not exposed at this United Front Work Department symposium, they will be exposed elsewhere. If it is allowed to lurk for a long time, it will cause greater harm. Now, being able to expose it early and transform it in time is really a key to reviving me and starting a new life. Ideological transformation is indeed painful, but I am willing to strive for long-term happiness after the pain!

The current rightists are rats crossing the street, everyone shouts and beats them, do I still willingly continue to be a rightist? I hate myself for being a rightist, and I also hate all rightists. I sincerely thank the Party for rescuing me from the wrong and confused path. Today, I swear on this solemn podium that I am determined to completely break with myself yesterday, determined to thoroughly draw a line in ideological terms with the bourgeois rightists, accept a thorough transformation, and determined to bravely participate in the anti-rightist struggle together with the people of the whole country; to temper myself and test myself in the struggle; to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, to cut off all anti-socialist thoughts, and to establish the thoughts of the working class; and determined to fully accept the leadership of the Party and resolutely follow the Party's socialist road!

Continue to expose Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks and deeds below:

(1) Between September and October of last year, when he conveyed the news that the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee was considering transferring back some Communist Party members who were working in the democratic parties, he expressed great satisfaction, because this would prevent the Communist Party members in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party from being an obstacle to his reckless actions.

(2) He spoke at the plenary session of the CPPCC this year, agreeing that counter-revolutionaries should be suppressed in the democratic parties, but in fact he was afraid of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, at the Third Plenary Session of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, when Comrade He Shikun suggested that the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party establish an anti-counter-revolutionary organization, he slammed the table and cursed, saying that He Shikun should be the director of the anti-counter-revolutionary committee, Zhang Yunchuan should be the deputy director, and Communist Party member Xu Binu should be a member. This is Zhang Bojun's two-faced behavior.

(3) At the working conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party this year, he publicly said that this was the first meeting to be the masters of our own affairs. When inviting Anhui cadres to dinner, he said, "Next year I can appoint your officials." This shows that Zhang Bojun did not feel free under the leadership of the Party in the past.

(4) Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a series of forums. Zhang said: "This is to offer opinions to the Communist Party, and I will personally participate." Judging from the content of the forums revealed by comrades such as Peking opera actress Li Huifang, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang) and the chairman and vice-chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee (Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng) were all present, which shows how enthusiastic they are about setting fire at the grassroots level.

(5) Zhang said in his oral report at the National Working Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, "Can't we really do better than them in our development work? (referring to other democratic parties) Tianjin developed hundreds of people at once, giving them a look. The development work in Tianjin was done by someone I sent. If there are any mistakes, the cadres are not responsible, I will be responsible." This is a concrete fact of Zhang Bojun's conspiracy to develop on a large scale.

(6) In April of this year, while studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Zhang said to the cadres, "Don't think that the people will not rebel, I think if it is not done well, the people will rebel." He also said, "Some intellectuals have been severely criticized in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and if this continues, the intellectuals will rebel." He also said, "Mao Zedong Thought has undergone great changes now. Not to mention that people outside the Party cannot keep up with these changes, even 90% of the Party members inside the Communist Party cannot keep up, which is a big problem. I am an opportunist, and we must grasp it." Zhang Bojun's major conspiratorial activities this time were based on this estimate.

### 我恨自己是一个右派分子  张云川的发言

    我恨自己是一个右派分子
    张云川的发言
    在这次会议中，又一次学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，听了周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长所作的各项报告，我完全拥护。同时，由于这些报告的启发和教育，却使我更认识到我的错误。
    我是一个犯了错误的人，今天走上这个庄严的会议讲台，感到万分惭愧。
    经过这些天来的检查，我认识到我犯错误的思想根源：（一）出身于地主家族，年青时受家庭环境的濡染，年长后又受宋明理学的影响，所以至今还一直残留着封建地主阶级的思想和感情。（二）一九二七年大革命失败后，我就参加了第三党，抗战期间，又参加了民主同盟。第三条路线的思想，一直很长的时间支配着我。（三）在解放后，我有革命包袱，常与民主党派内某些人比地位比待遇，有个人主义的名位思想。（四）解放以来，我没有很好的学习，在三大改造五大运动中，也没有受到教育和改造。因此，反社会主义思想，还存在我脑子里没有得到根本排除。在平时，对党所领导的伟大人民事业，如各种建设的成就，国际地位的提高等，不能说全都视而不见，听而不闻。但是热爱不够，自豪感不强，这是我有作客思想、抗拒因素的具体表现。一旦触及个人利害时，就会流露出对党不满。在学习和讨论问题时，就会发出反社会主义的言论。有时甚至像对党有仇恨一样。这一次在中央统战座谈会上的发言，其中有很多反党反社会主义的地方，只不过是上述反动思想的又一次的暴露。
    我是农工民主党的成员，也是中国民主同盟的成员。在民盟中，我常怀有宗派情绪，自以为是“跑单帮”，实际上是陷于完全孤立。对于进步的同志，不能主动的向他们靠拢，反埋怨他们不来团结我。对于章、罗等，我以为他们是要抓大知识分子，在搞宗派，最显著的例子，在民盟第二次全国代表大会时，他们把一些大知识分子的普通盟员，一下提出为中央委员或常务委员；而对于一些民盟创立时的中央委员，甚至还想把他们刷掉。所以我同他们在感情上一直是对立的。但是对于他们要搞大发展和抬高民主党派地位的主张（实际是一种阴谋），我又是同意的。在农工民主党内，章（伯钧）、黄（琪翔）等一直是个小集团，不断的打击我，排挤我，尤其我与章伯钧个人间的感情，近十年来，几乎近于破裂。但我和他二十七、八年以来，却始终在一个政治组织内；解放前，他搞军事投机，要形成第三势力，我是参加活动者之一；从去年起，他主张搞大发展，我也同意；在这次鸣放中，我和他又都发表了反党反社会主义的言论，前几点都说明我在思想上政治上和他还是相同的。由于我自己也有反社会主义的思想根源，所以平时就没有能力辨别章、罗等言行的反动本质，只以为他们搞小宗派，是为争夺个人权利，却未意识到他们是有纲领、有组织、有计划的反动集团，在搞反党反社会主义的阴谋活动。
    我这次在统战座谈会上的发言，例如说“有些党员是站在群众的头上，脱离群众”，实际上是对党员的污蔑。又说“假积极分子”是“打墙挖沟的义勇队”，实际上是使真积极分子不敢接近党。同时还举许多不恰当的例子来批评统战工作，是削弱统战政策的作用。尤其我同一切右派分子一样，也是不喜欢先肯定成绩，再谈缺点，实际上是抹杀成绩，强调缺点。例如我多次到各地视察，错误的以为发现缺点，及时反映，是视察的主要任务；现在我才认识到这都是极严重的错误。再者，我的发言，虽与章、罗等不是有计划的配合，实际上却是起了共鸣作用，替他们摇旗呐喊，作了扩大宣传。因为我是民主同盟的副秘书长，农工民主党的中央执行局委员，又是全国人民代表，所以我的言论，在右派分子的言论中，是有相当大的影响的；甚至台湾都拿我的话来利用，就可以看出我是站在什么立场说话，和我的发言的危害性是如何大了。在这一点上，我是犯了不可饶恕的错误。
    至于章伯钧是一个野心很大、专门喜欢观望风色，投机取巧的流氓政客，已为各方面揭露的事实所证明。现在我只补充一点，说明他是贯用合法的组织，进行非法的活动。当党开始整风时，农工党派出好几批人到各地去发展组织，正是他阴谋的一部分。我被派往郑州，准备建立农工民主党的组织，实际上也是执行他的阴谋。我在人大河南小组上开始尝说，我对发展组织，并不积极，其实如果条件允许，一下发展几百几千人，我也不会反对的。从以上所说的各点来看，我与章伯钧、罗隆基等尽管感情上一向是对立的，但在思想上、政治上则是一致的。在章、罗同盟被揭露以后，从形式上说，我总以为不在他们的集团以内，与他们无关。然从实质上说，这种看法是错误的；因为他们的阴谋如果得逞，又对我消除了个人间的感情冲突，我被他们拖入反动泥坑，是十分可能的。说到这里，发现我已走到了危险的边缘，真是不寒而慄！
    这次全国人民展开了反右派斗争，右派分子的阴谋计划和丑恶面貌，已被揭露出来；给了我当头一棒，我才开始清醒过来。我认识到我以往的错误思想，错误言论，对党对社会主义是起了如何严重的危害作用！我认识到以前我所以不能辨别香花与毒草，所以听到右派分子反党反社会主义的言论，就觉得很合口胃，正因为我的思想也是右派思想。我认识到在我思想深处的错误根源；我的错误思想，是客观存在的，即令不在这次统战座谈会上暴露出来，也会在其他地方暴露出来。若任其长期潜伏，将为害更大。现在能以及早暴露，及时改造，对我实在是一个起死回生、重新做人的关键。思想改造诚然是痛苦的，但我愿意争取痛苦以后的长期快乐！
    现在的右派分子，已是老鼠过街，人人喊打，难道我还甘心继续作一个右派分子么？我恨自己是一个右派分子，也恨一切右派分子。我衷心地感谢党，把我从错误迷惘的道路中挽救出来。我今天在这庄严的讲台上宣誓，我决心使今天的我，与昨天的我彻底决裂，决心与资产阶级右派分子彻底划清思想界限，接受脱胎换骨的改造；并决心和全国人民一道，勇敢地参加反右派的斗争；在斗争中锻炼自己，考验自己；加强马克思列宁主义的学习，割除一切反社会主义的思想，树立工人阶级的思想；决心完全接受党的领导，坚决的跟着党走社会主义的道路！
    对章伯钧的反动言行，继续揭发于下：
    （一）去年九、十月间，他传达中央统战部考虑将调回一些在民主党派内担任业务工作的共产党员的时候，表示甚为得意，因为这样就可免得共产党员在农工党内，对于他的胡作非为碍手碍眼。
    （二）他在今年政协全体会议上发言，赞成民主党派内要进行肃反，其实他是怕肃反的。所以在农工民主党三中全会，何世琨同志建议农工党中央成立肃反机构时，他便拍桌大骂，说让何世琨来做肃反委员会主任委员，张云川来做副主任委员，共产党员徐彬如来做委员。这是章伯钧的两面作风。
    （三）在今年农工民主党工作会议上，他公开说，这次是第一次当家作主的会议。在请安徽干部吃饭时，他说，明年我就可以委你们的官了。这是章伯钧表示以往在党的领导下不自由。
    （四）最近农工党北京市委会举行一系列的座谈会，章说：“这是要为共产党提意见，我要亲自参加”。从京剧演员李慧芳等同志所揭发的座谈会内容来看，农工党中央的正副主席（章伯钧、黄琪翔）和北京市委会的正副主任委员（李伯球、李健生）一起都到场，可见他们对于基层点火，是如何热心了。
    （五）章在农工党全国工作会议的口头报告中曾说过“我们的发展工作，真搞不过他们吗？（指其他民主党派）天津一下子就发展几百人，给他们一个脸色看。天津的发展工作，是我派人去这样搞的。如果有错误，干部不负责，责任由我来负”。这是章伯钧搞大发展的阴谋的具体事实。
    （六）今年四月在学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，章曾同干部们讲“你们不要以为老百姓不会造反，我看搞不好，老百姓是要造反的”。又说“在肃反中有些知识分子被斗得很厉害，如果这样下去，知识分子是要造反的”。又说“毛泽东思想现在有了很大的变化，这种变化莫说党外人士跟不上，就是共产党内部也有90％的党员是跟不上，这是个大问题。我就是机会主义，我们要掌握”。章伯钧这次的大阴谋活动，就是根据这种估计来的。
