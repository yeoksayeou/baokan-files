Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 12th: After a month of extensive discussions among all faculty and students, the relocation plan of Jiaotong University has been finalized, deciding to establish branches in Xi'an and Shanghai, under unified leadership.

This plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Higher Education for approval and then implemented.

Since Premier Zhou raised the guiding principle for the relocation of Jiaotong University at a State Council meeting discussing the issue in early June, all faculty, staff, and students of the university have engaged in repeated discussions. Teachers and students in Xi'an also visited factories under construction in the Northwest, gaining practical insights into the needs of teaching and construction. Consequently, the vast majority of teachers and students in both locations have gradually and clearly understood the fundamental principles that must be adhered to in resolving this issue. They recognized that one of the conditions for the 1955 decision to relocate Jiaotong University inland—the international situation—while having changed, did not negate the Northwest region's genuine need for a large-scale, multidisciplinary industrial university. They acknowledged Jiaotong University's undeniable responsibility to support the development of the Northwest. During the discussions, they carefully considered various reasonable suggestions put forward by everyone. The University Affairs Committee conducted extensive research on these specific issues and ultimately proposed this relocation plan, which has garnered the support of the vast majority, aiming to both support the development of the Northwest and address the needs of Shanghai.

According to the needs of the Northwest and Shanghai regions, the plan stipulates that the task of the Xi'an branch of the university is to establish relatively complete major programs in machinery and electrical engineering, gradually add programs in new technologies, and develop into a university of science and technology. The task of the Shanghai branch is to maintain excellent programs in machinery, electrical engineering, and other fields. Regarding the allocation of faculty and staff, the principles are to vigorously support the Northwest, ensure the teaching quality of both locations, and consider the individuals' preferences.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 14th: Faculty, staff, and students of the Xi'an branch of Jiaotong University have expressed their support for the new relocation plan of Jiaotong University.

All twelve teaching and research groups in the Xi'an branch have agreed to and support the new plan. According to Lu Qingle, Deputy Director of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group, and Associate Professor Xu Guifang, more than two-thirds of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group expressed their willingness to stay and work in Xi'an. To ensure teaching quality, they hope that the Shanghai branch will transfer some more teachers to teach in Xi'an.

Many teachers have expressed their willingness to stay in Xi'an for the long term to teach. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have not only expressed their determination to support the Northwest for a long time but also guaranteed to obey the organizational allocation and go wherever they are needed.

The Communist Youth League branch committee, student union, Jiu San Society group, and many student classes of the Xi'an branch have successively made resolutions, unanimously expressing their support for and guarantee of the implementation of this new plan that properly solves the relocation problem. Some students who had previously insisted on their own opinions against the relocation have recently begun to recognize some incorrect views and certain wrong practices in the relocation discussion process. They have expressed their firm obedience to the implementation of the new plan. They have now begun to study rectification documents and have entered the struggle against the rightists.

    分设西安上海　实行统一领导
    交通大学确定迁校新方案
    据新华社上海12日电　交通大学迁校方案经过全校师生一个月广泛讨论以后，决定分设西安、上海两地，统一领导。
    这个方案将报请高等教育部批准以后实施。
    交通大学迁校问题从6月初周总理在国务院召开的讨论交大迁校问题的会议上提出方针以后，全校师生员工进行了反复的讨论，在西安的师生还参观了西北正在建造的工厂，了解了有关教学工作和建设需要的许多实际情况。因此，两地绝大多数教师和学生都逐步明确地看清楚了决定这一问题所必须坚持的基本原则，以及1955年决定交通大学内迁的条件之一——国际情势虽然已有变化，但是西北地区的确需要一所规模较大的多科性的工业大学，认识了支援西北建设的任务是交通大学义不容辞的。在讨论中，并仔细考虑了大家所提出的若干合理意见。校务委员会对于这些具体问题作了多方面的研究，最后提出了这个获得绝大多数人拥护的既支援西北建设又照顾上海需要的迁校方案。
    这个方案根据西北和上海地区的需要，规定了学校的西安部分的任务，是较完整地设置机、电方面的重要专业，并且逐步添设新技术方面的专业，发展成为理工大学。上海部分的任务是办好机、电等各专业。关于教职员工的调配，以大力支援西北、保证两地教学质量和照顾本人意见为原则。
    据新华社西安14日电　交通大学西安部分师生员工，纷纷表示拥护交大迁校的新方案。
    西安部分十二个教研组已全部同意并拥护这个新方案。据数学教研组副主任陆庆乐、副教授徐桂芳谈，在数学教研组表示愿意留在西安工作的占三分之二还多。为了保证教学质量，他们希望上海部分再抽调一些教师来西安教学。
    好些教师纷纷提出愿意长期留在西安教学。党员和团员教师除表示决心长期支援西北外，并保证服从组织调配，哪里需要到哪里去。
    西安部分的共青团分团委会、学生会、九三小组以及许多学生班级已纷纷作出决议，一致表示拥护和保证执行这个妥善解决迁校问题的新方案。原来一直坚持己见反对迁校的一部学生，最近也开始认识了在迁校讨论过程中的一些不正确的看法和某些错误作法，他们表示坚决服从新方案的实施。目前他们已开始学习整风文件，转入到反右派斗争中去了。
