In another speech, I, along with representatives Yang Tingbao, Lin Keming, and Zhu Zhaoxue, offered some immature opinions on some issues in the current architectural work. Now, please allow me to take a few more minutes of your time to talk about my experiences during the two and a half months of the rectification campaign, or rather, my experiences during the eight years since liberation in the anti-rightist struggle.

How did I begin to understand the Party?

For the past eight years, I have spent almost every day in excitement and happiness. Day after day, I have grown to love our Party and our Chairman Mao more and more.

I will never forget the morning of December 13, 1948, when my family's nanny (at that time, we still called her "Old Amah") Liu, came from our home in Chengfu Village near Tsinghua University to begin her day's work. She excitedly described how, that morning, she opened the door and suddenly discovered that the Eighth Route Army had entered the village. They said they had come in the middle of the night, but not even a dog was disturbed. How they slept in the alley all night in the freezing cold, and how they thanked people profusely even for a bowl of boiled water. In her words, "I've lived for over sixty years, but I've never seen such an army. People always said the Eighth Route Army was good, but I didn't believe it. Today, I finally saw it!"

The first soldier of the People's Liberation Army I encountered was one who walked three miles with a broken willow basket to return it to an old villager. Compared to the Kuomintang regimental commander who had taken all the qipaos of a female staff member during the retreat a few days earlier, I was so moved that I could not speak.

On the third day of the liberation of Tsinghua University, a cadre came. He said that if it was necessary to attack the city, they would try their best to avoid damaging cultural relics and buildings, and asked me to mark them on the map and briefly explain their history and artistic value. When I was a child, I read Mencius: "With baskets of rice and pots of drink, to welcome the royal army." That day, those words became concrete in my mind.

In the past, I had no understanding of the Communist Party at all. From that moment on, I "fell in love at first sight."

Without the Party, could these things have been done?

Over the past eight years, countless brilliant achievements have been made in industry, agriculture, science, culture, and art. The newspapers report on them almost every day, so there is no need for me to repeat them here. I will only talk about two figures from the early days of Beijing's liberation: In the year after Beijing's liberation, 349,000 tons of garbage left over from the Ming and Qing dynasties were cleared from the city, and 610,000 tons of manure were removed. These are two small things, but they are two great miracles, two great little things that we can be proud of. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we would never have been able to do these two things, let alone those big things. I don't know when, but I have developed 100% confidence in the Party.

Which of the achievements of the past eight years has not been achieved under the leadership of the Party? Without the leadership of the Party, could we have an annual steel production of five million tons this year? Could we have the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge? Could we make cars and airplanes? Could we have the plans for dozens of cities? Could we have more than 142.6 million square meters of newly built civilian buildings? Could we have increased grain production to 360 billion jin in 1956, a year of severe natural disasters? Leaving aside these great achievements in economic construction, let's look at science, culture, and art. Without the leadership of the Party, could a group of us so-called senior intellectuals have formulated a twelve-year scientific perspective plan? Could Tsinghua University have developed from a comprehensive university with more than 2,000 students into a multi-disciplinary industrial university with nearly 9,000 students? Without the leadership of the Party, could our sports continuously break past records every year? Without the leadership of the Party, could we hear and see the rich and colorful songs and dances of our fraternal nationalities? In the words that farmers love to say: The kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao cannot be expressed in three days and three nights! The Party has criticized me, but that was a mother's condemnation.

But on the other hand, have I had any troubles in my work in the past? Yes, and many, and not small ones either. My trouble was that "the Party is good in everything, but it's a pity they don't understand architecture." "The trouble with people is that they like to be teachers," so I began to make mistakes. I single-handedly wanted to launch an anti-Party movement in the field of architecture. I wrote articles, gave reports, systematically gave academic lectures, and used my theories to educate the young teachers and students of the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University. In order to oppose the American-style glass boxes, I consciously used Chairman Mao's words, that to correct a wrong, one must go to the extreme. Therefore, in order to correct the wrong of square boxes, one had to go to the extreme and engage in revivalism. I wanted to create a school of thought and use the pressure of the masses to "educate" the leading comrades of the Party. My erroneous theories influenced many architects across the country, causing huge waste. As a leading comrade later told me, even many Communist Party members were "captured" by me. Just as I was secretly pleased, I found myself suddenly becoming the target of national criticism. I was shocked. I felt very heavy. However, I had no resistance to the Party. I thought: They must be "rectifying" me like this because my architectural theories are detrimental to the construction of the motherland. My pain was the pain of a child condemned by his mother. Why? Because I trusted our Party as much as I trusted my mother when I was a child. Before I figured things out, I was in great pain, but the Party patiently reasoned with me. I figured it out, and I was convinced from the bottom of my heart. I bowed my head; I admitted my mistakes. Later, I learned that the People's Daily and the Beijing Daily had received nearly a hundred articles criticizing me, but the Party did not publish them, so as not to let the masses equate me with Hu Shi, Hu Feng, Liang Shuming, and others who were being criticized at the time. Because mine was an academic and ideological issue, if two Hus and two Liangs were mentioned together, they could kill me with one blow. Only then did I realize the Party's meticulous care for me, and I was only grateful and moved from the depths of my heart. I am a prodigal son. After this education, I knew that I would never, ever leave our Party again. I learned a good lesson in this struggle.

On April 30 this year, the Party issued the decision to carry out the rectification campaign, which once again deeply moved me. I saw a wise and great Party, and the image of Chairman Mao immediately appeared before my eyes. I looked forward to the new atmosphere after the rectification campaign, and that we would be able to better meet the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan. Unexpectedly, in less than a month, the fallacies of the rightists came out. I felt extremely indignant, but my level was really too low, and my political sense was really slow. How could I have imagined that they were carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist despicable acts in an organized, programmed, and planned manner? Chairman Mao said: There are still a few percent of the five million intellectuals who do not support socialism. When I first heard this, my understanding was very abstract. I thought it was just a matter of ideological awareness, and only among a very small number of people, so it didn't matter much. Now I can see it concretely. This small group of people is really capable. Not only are there non-Party members, but even Party members. They can actually stir up trouble and create dark clouds in the sky. What surprised me even more was that so many of the rightists were old friends whom I had respected as progressive for many years. They said: He was fooled by Zhang and Luo, so I sympathized with them and comforted them. When students criticized them, I said to the students that they were scientists and teachers, and that they should be gentle and rain-like, and not too fierce. But in the struggle, as the rightists' conspiracies were gradually revealed, I gradually realized that this was already a severe class struggle, and they were already our class enemies. We cannot have the slightest bit of tenderness or leniency towards them. We must resolutely and bravely give them a merciless counterattack.

Over the past eight years, I thought that my position had been firmly established, and that I had learned a little bit of Marxism-Leninism. In fact, intellectuals like us are just seedlings cultivated in a greenhouse. We have not experienced wind and frost, and we have not been tempered. People with ulterior motives can deceive us with a few sweet words. I was not captured by them, although it was also based on a little understanding, but what is certain is that the analytical power at the time of understanding was very weak. Thanks to Chairman Mao's simple and clear speeches, thanks to Chairman Mao's six criteria for us, thanks to the leadership of the Party, I have joined this battle as a small soldier. As the battle begins to deepen, I feel even more deeply how the Party's leadership has strengthened my confidence and strength. I specifically realized why the Party is the vanguard of the working class. Without the correct leadership of the vanguard, the outcome of this battle would be unimaginable. The battle has gradually deepened, and the conspiracies and ugly deeds of a small group of rightists will be fully exposed. Street rats have no holes to drill back into. This battle will end with our soaring victory song. The victory song will dispel the dark clouds looming over the city. The wind blows away the clouds, and after the rain, the sky clears. At that time, we can sit down again and smoothly continue to eliminate the three pests in the gentle breeze and drizzle. Today, standing here, I have already seen a stronger, purer, and more lovable Party. I have already seen how we will meet the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan with such strong strength and confidence.

Our Party is so lovable, that is why I love our Party so much!

The heart's desire will one day be realized.

Finally, a few extra words: Today, I am not yet a Communist Party member, but a member of the China Democratic League. Luo Longji does not approve of League members joining the Party. But more than a year ago, when I congratulated my daughter on her glorious entry into the Party, she said that she was not yet satisfied. She said that she not only wanted to be a Communist Party member, but also a daughter of a Communist Party member. I wonder what Luo Longji thinks of my daughter's words? No matter what you think, I think this is the most "filial" word that a new type of filial daughter in New China can say to her dad, and the most friendly word between comrades who are fighting side by side for the lofty cause of communism. And I believe that one day, the Party will allow me to fulfill the wish of my lovely daughter comrade.

### 我为什么这样爱我们的党？  梁思成的发言

    我为什么这样爱我们的党？
    梁思成的发言
    在另一个发言中，我同杨廷宝、林克明、朱兆雪三位代表对目前建筑工作中的一些问题提供了几点不成熟的意见。现在请允许我再费各位代表几分钟的时间，谈谈我对整风两个半月来的一点体会，也可以说，在反右派斗争中，我对解放八年来的一点体会。
    我是怎样开始认识党的？
    八年来，我差不多每天都在兴奋激动的心情中渡过高兴愉快的一天。一天一天地过去，我就一天比一天地更加爱我们的党，爱我们的毛主席。
    我永远忘记不了一九四八年十二月十三日的早晨，我家的保姆（那时候我们还叫她做“老妈子”）刘妈从清华大学附近的成府村的家里来开始她一天的工作时，怎样兴奋地叙述了那天清早她打开大门突然发现村子里已经开来了八路，他们说是半夜开进来的，可是连一条狗都没有惊动，怎样在严寒中就在胡同里睡了一夜，怎样连一碗开水都是谢了又谢才接过去喝的。就用她的话说：“我活了六十多了，可没见过这样的队伍。人家都说八路好，我就不信。今儿个我可瞧见了！”
    我所接触的第一个解放军是一个拿着一个破柳条筐子走三里路去还给一个老乡的战士，同前两天在撤退时把一位女职员的旗袍全部带走了的国民党团长对比之下，使我感动得说不出话来。
    清华大学解放的第三天，来了一位干部。他说假使不得已要攻城时，要极力避免破坏文物建筑，让我在地图上注明，并略略讲讲它们的历史、艺术价值。童年读孟子，“箪食壶浆，以迎王师”这两句话，那天在我的脑子里具体化了。
    过去，我对共产党完全没有认识。从那时候起，我就“一见倾心”了。
    没有党，这些事业作得出来吗？
    八年来，工业、农业、科学、文化、艺术上数不完的光辉成就，差不多每天的报纸都有所报道，也无需我在这里重复。我只讲北京解放初期的两个数目字：在北京解放后的一年中，从城里清除了明、清两朝存下来的三十四万九千吨垃圾，清除了六十一万吨大粪。这是两件小事，却是两个伟大的奇迹，是令我们可以自豪的两件伟大的小事。就是这样两件事，没有中国共产党的领导，我们是永远也做不到的，更不用说那些大事了。不知从什么时候起，我已经养成了对党的百分之百的信心了。
    八年来的成就，哪一件不是在党的领导下取得的？没有党的领导，我们今年能有五百万吨钢的年产量吗？能有武汉长江大桥吗？能做汽车、飞机吗？能有几十个城市的规划吗？能有新建的一亿四千二百六十多万平方公尺的民用建筑吗？能在天灾严重的一九五六年使粮食增产到三千六百亿斤吗？这些伟大的经济建设的成就姑且放下不提，且看科学、文化艺术方面。没有党的领导，我们一群所谓高级知识分子能制订十二年科学远景规划吗？清华大学能由一个二千多学生的综合性大学发展成为一个将近九千学生的多科性工业大学吗？没有党的领导，我们的体育运动能年年不断地打破过去的纪录吗？没有党的领导，我们能够听得到看得到各兄弟民族丰富多采的歌声和舞姿吗？用一句农民爱说的话：共产党、毛主席的恩情三天三夜也说不完！党批评过我，但那是母亲般的谴责
    但在另一方面，过去我在工作中有没有烦恼呢？有，而且不少也不小。我的烦恼是“党什么都好，就是可惜不懂建筑”。“人之患在好为人师”，我就开始犯错误了。我一个人单枪匹马地想搞一个在建筑领域中的反党运动。我写文章，做报告，系统地做学术讲演，并且以我的理论教育清华大学建筑系的青年教师和学生。为了反对美国式的玻璃方匣子，我有意识地搬用了毛主席的话，矫枉必须过正，所以为了矫方匣子之枉，必须过正地去搞复古主义。我想搞成一个学派，以群众的压力来“教育”党的领导同志。我的错误理论在全国范围内影响了不少建筑师，造成巨大浪费。正如一位领导同志后来告诉我说：连许多共产党员都被我“俘虏”了。正在我暗暗高兴的时候，我发现自己突然成了全国性的批判对象。使我大吃一惊。我心情非常沉重。但是，我同党并没有抵触情绪。我想：这样“整”我，一定是因为我的建筑理论是不利于祖国建设的。我的痛苦是一个受到母亲谴责的孩子的痛苦。为什么？因为我信任我们的党像我小时候信任我的妈妈一样。我思想没有搞通以前真是痛苦万分，但是党却是那样耐心地同我讲道理。我搞通了，从心底下服气了。我低头；我承认错误。后来我知道了人民日报和北京日报曾收到了将近一百篇批判我的文章，而党没有发表，为的是不要让群众把我同当时正在受到批判的胡适、胡风、梁漱溟等同起来。因为我的是一个学术思想问题，若是两个姓胡的，两个姓梁的相提并论，就可以一棍子把我打死。我才知道党对我的这种无微不至的爱护，我只有从心眼最深处感激感动。我是一个回头浪子。我受到这次教育，我就知道我永远永远一步也不会再离开我们的党了。在这次斗争中我得到了很好的教训
    今年四月三十日，党发出整风的决定，又一次使我深深地感动。我看见了一个英明伟大的党，毛主席的形象立刻就涌现在我眼前。我憧憬着整风以后的新气象，我们将能更好地迎接第二个五年计划的任务。岂料不到一个月，右派的谬论就出来了。我感到无比地愤慨，但我的水平实在太低，政治嗅觉实在迟钝，我怎么想得到他们竟是有组织、有纲领、有计划地进行反党、反社会主义的卑鄙勾当呢？毛主席说：五百万知识分子中还有百分之几不赞成社会主义，我当初听了体会得很抽象，还认为只是思想意识问题，而且只是极少数人中的极少数，算不了什么。现在我可具体地看到了。这一小撮人的神通真不小，不但有党外人士，甚至也有党员，他们竟能兴风作浪，搅得乌云盖天。更使我吃惊的是：右派分子中竟然有那么多是我多年来尊之为进步的老朋友。他们说：他上了章、罗的当了，我就同情他们，安慰他们。学生批判他们，我就对同学们说，他们是科学家，是老师，要和风细雨一些，不要太猛了。但在斗争中，在右派阴谋之被逐步揭发中，我才逐渐认识到，这已是一场严厉的阶级斗争，他们已是我们的阶级敌人。对他们是不能有丝毫的温情、丝毫的姑息的。我们必须坚决勇敢地予以无情的反击。
    八年来，自己以为立场已经站稳了，马列主义也学到一点了。其实像我们这样的知识分子，仅仅是温室里培养出来的幼苗，没有经过风霜，没有经过锻炼，别有用心的人几句花言巧语，就可以被他唬过去。我竟然没有成为他们的俘虏，虽说也凭一点认识，但可肯定的是，认识时的分析力是十分薄弱的。感谢毛主席深入浅出的讲话，感谢毛主席给我们的六项标准，感谢党的领导，我已加入了这战斗的队伍作为一名小卒。战斗才开始深入，我更深切地感到党的领导怎样加强了我的信心和力量。我具体地认识到党为什么是工人阶级的先锋队。没有先锋队的正确领导，这场战斗的结局是不可思议的。战斗已逐步深入，一小撮右派分子的阴谋、丑行将被全部揭露。过街老鼠再没有地洞可以钻回去了。这场战斗将以我们响彻云霄的凯歌结束。凯歌将驱散压城欲摧的乌云。风吹云散，雨过天晴，那时候，我们可以再度坐下来，在和风细雨中顺利地继续除三害。今天我站在这里已经看见了一个更壮大、更纯洁、更可爱的党，已经看见了我们将以多么坚强的力量和信心来迎接第二个五年计划的任务。
    我们的党实在可爱，所以我这样爱我们的党！
    心底的愿望总有一天会实现
    最后几句赘言：今天我还不是一个共产党员，而是中国民主同盟的盟员。罗隆基是不赞成盟员入党的。但是一年多以前，当我祝贺我的女儿光荣地入党的时候，她却说，她还不满意。她说她不仅要做一个共产党员，而且要做一个共产党员的女儿。不知罗隆基对我女儿的话有什么意见？不管你什么意见，我却认为这是新中国的新型孝女所能对她的爹爹说的最“孝顺”的一句话，也是为共产主义的崇高事业并肩奋斗的同志间的最友爱的一句话。我并且相信，总有一天，党会允许我满足我这个可爱的女儿同志的愿望的。
