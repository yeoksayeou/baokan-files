    Shanxi Expands Medicinal Herb Production
    (Our Report) Shanxi Province is actively restoring and developing the production of Chinese medicinal herbs. This year's medicinal herb production plan in Shanxi Province includes the cultivation of twenty-seven types of medicinal herbs, with a planting area of 51,889 mu. As of now, 47,548 mu have been sown, completing 91.62% of the original plan; adding the 13,685 mu that are being and will be sown, it will exceed the plan by 18%.
    Among the cultivated medicinal herbs, eleven are in short supply nationwide, such as Rehmannia glutinosa and Achyranthes bidentata. The successful trial planting of these herbs should improve the situation. Codonopsis pilosula and Astragalus membranaceus are the main products of medicinal herb production in Shanxi Province. This year, the planting area of Codonopsis pilosula has been expanded by 60% compared to last year, and Astragalus membranaceus has been expanded by twenty times (previously, it was mainly wild, and the cultivated area was small). The production of wild medicinal herbs such as Lycium chinense, Acorus tatarinowii, and Flos Farfarae is decreasing due to the closure of mountains for forest cultivation, soil and water conservation, and the elimination of weeds in the fields. These are now gradually being changed to artificial cultivation. (Li Huanqing, Zhou Guoyu)

    山西扩大药材生产
    本报讯　山西省积极恢复与发展中药材的生产。今年山西省中药材生产计划中，栽培药材计二十七种，种植面积为五万一千八百八十九亩。截至目前，已播种四万七千五百四十八亩，完成原计划的91.62％；加上正在和将要下种的一万三千六百八十五亩，则可超过计划18％。
    栽培药材中有十一种是属于全国供应紧张的，如生地和怀牛夕等，这次试种成功，情况当可改善。党参、黄茋是山西省药材生产的主要产品，今年党参播种面积比去年扩大60％，黄茋扩大达二十倍（过去以野生为主，栽培面积不大）。枸?、菖蒲、冬花等野生药材，因受封山育林、水土保持以及田阡消除杂草等影响而减产，现在正逐步改变为人工培植。（李焕卿、周国瑜）
