Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 12th: The Soviet Communist Party and government delegation arrived in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, on July 12th for a visit.

On the morning of July 11th, Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the delegation visited one of Prague's largest machine factories, the Skodas Stalingrad Machine Manufacturing Factory. In the afternoon, they visited the unified agricultural cooperative in Hreni village, near Prague. That evening, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the President of the Republic, Zapotocky, held a reception for them.

Khrushchev, Bulganin, and others participated in a mass rally at the Stalingrad Machine Manufacturing Factory during their visit. Khrushchev also delivered a speech at the rally.

In his speech, Khrushchev praised the Czechoslovak Communist Party for consistently and resolutely defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism, delivering fatal blows to revisionists, maintaining the purity of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively applying these ideas in combination with the characteristics of its own national development, in the process of leading the working people to fight for the construction of socialism, both in the past and present.

Khrushchev said that each country in the socialist camp has its own characteristics and features determined by its own history, economic and cultural development, and national traditions.

Within each country, each Communist and Workers' Party has its own way of solving certain individual problems, and its own views on certain tasks. Each party conducts its work from the specific conditions of its own country and the level of economic and cultural development.

Let us take People's China as an example. This is a great country, and I say it is a country with unique conditions. When studying the experience of socialist construction in other countries, the Chinese comrades do not copy or repeat, but lead socialist construction based on Marxist-Leninist theory and in combination with their own conditions. This cannot be a subject of dispute. On the contrary, we are pleased that our Chinese friends are smoothly solving the task of transforming their own country in accordance with socialist principles.

Khrushchev said that the parties of our countries are unshakably united in the basic and main aspects, and in loyalty to the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. No matter how the guardians of capitalists try to shake our unity, they will not achieve any results. Whether in the past or in the future, we will protect this unity as we protect our eyes.

Khrushchev emphasized that building socialism is not an easy task. Establishing a socialist economy requires tremendous and intense effort. We know this very clearly from our own experience. Our country used to be backward in terms of economy and culture. But the Communist Party has made our country the second in the world in terms of total industrial output. Now there is only one country ahead of us, the United States. But one day we will catch up with and surpass the United States.

When talking about the Hungarian incident, Khrushchev said that we have learned certain lessons from the Hungarian incident. First of all, we should increase our revolutionary vigilance, secondly, we should more closely unite all the forces of the socialist camp, and thirdly, we should resolutely and bravely eliminate the shortcomings and mistakes in our work.

He said that the Hungarian incident showed that if the dictatorship of the working class is weakened, the socialist achievements of the working people will be seriously threatened. Only the enemies of socialism would say that Lenin's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is outdated. We must not forget that as long as the capitalist system exists, the reactionary forces of imperialism will carry out subversive activities against socialist countries. In this case, can we allow the weakening of the power of the working class? No, otherwise it would exactly suit the appetite of the enemies of the working people.

Khrushchev emphasized that the resolutions of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee are of great significance in the life of our party and country. As you all know, this plenary session condemned the sectarian activities of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov, because they opposed the Leninist line of the Party on the most important issues of domestic and foreign policy. The resolutions of the June Plenary Session have been warmly responded to, deeply understood, and unanimously supported by all fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties. We will continue to implement the domestic and foreign policies stipulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU more resolutely. This is our path. No one can make us leave this path.

    苏联党政代表团在捷进行访问  赫鲁晓夫指出各兄弟党团结一致
    强调无产阶级专政绝对不容削弱
    据新华社布拉格12日电　苏联共产党和政府代表团7月12日到达斯洛伐克首府布拉迪斯拉发访问。
    7月11日上午，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和代表团其他人员访问了布拉格最大的机器工厂之一——斯克德斯大林格勒机器制造工厂。下午，他们又访问了布拉格近郊黑尼乡的统一农业合作社。当天晚上，捷共中央和共和国总统萨波托斯基为他们举行了招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁等在访问斯大林格勒机器制造工厂的时候，曾参加了工厂的群众欢迎大会。赫鲁晓夫并且在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中称赞捷克斯洛伐克共产党在领导劳动人民为建设社会主义而斗争的过程中，过去和现在一贯坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则，给修正主义者以致命的回击，保持马克思列宁主义伟大思想的纯洁性，并且善于创造地运用这种思想，把它和自己国家发展的特点相结合起来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，社会主义阵营的每一个国家都有由本国历史、经济和文化发展以及民族传统所决定的特点和特色。
    在每一个国家内，每一个共产党和工人党都有自己解决某种个别问题的办法，都有自己对某个任务的见解。每一个党进行自己的工作，都是从本国的具体条件和经济及文化发展的水平出发的。
    让我们以人民中国为例，这是一个伟大的国家，我说它是具有特独条件的国家。中国同志在学习其他国家的社会主义建设的经验时不是抄袭，也不是重复，而是根据马克思列宁主义学说，结合本身条件来领导社会主义建设。这不可能成为争论的对象。相反的，我们感到高兴的是，我们的中国朋友正在顺利地按照社会主义的原则解决改造自己国家的任务。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们各国的党在基本和主要方面，都忠于马克思列宁主义，忠于它们基本原则方面是牢不可破地团结一致的。无论资本家的卫士怎样想动摇我们的团结，他们是得不到丝毫结果的。无论过去或者今后我们都像保护眼睛一样地保护这种团结。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，建设社会主义，这不是一件容易的事。建立社会主义经济要求巨大的紧张的努力。我们根据切身的经验非常清楚地知道这点。我们国家在经济和文化方面曾经是落后的。但是共产党已经使我国在工业总产值方面达到世界第二位。现在走在我们前面的只有一个美国。但是，终有一天我们会赶上和超过美国。赫鲁晓夫在谈到匈牙利事件问题的时候说，我们从匈牙利事件中吸取了一定的教训。我们首先应当提高革命警惕性，其次要更加紧密地团结社会主义阵营的一切力量，第三要坚决勇敢地消除我们工作中的缺点和错误。
    他说，匈牙利事件表明，如果工人阶级专政削弱了，劳动人民的社会主义胜利果实就会受到严重威胁。只有社会主义的敌人才会说列宁的无产阶级专政的学说过时了。我们不应该忘记，只要资本主义制度存在，帝国主义反动势力就会对社会主义国家进行颠复活动。在这种情况下难道能够容许削弱工人阶级的政权么？不能，否则就恰恰合乎劳动人民敌人的胃口。
    赫鲁晓夫着重说，苏共中央六月全会决议在我们党和国家生活中具有重大意义。你们都知道，这次全会谴责了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫反党集团的宗派活动，因为他们在内外政策的最重要的问题上反对党的列宁主义路线。六月全会决议受到了所有兄弟共产党和工人党的热烈响应、深切谅解和一致拥护。我们将更加坚决地继续实行苏共第二十次党代表大会所规定的内政和外交路线。这就是我们的道路。任何人也不能使我们离开这条道路。
