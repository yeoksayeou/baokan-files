Title: Questioning "New Observer"

The "New Observer" has recently published many anti-socialist and inflammatory articles. These statements are in the same vein as the ideas of the Rightists, demonstrating the editorial department's serious right-leaning tendencies.

The tenth issue of "New Observer," published on May 16th, featured a comprehensive report on the Hundred Flowers Campaign titled "A Garden Full of Buds Just Opening," which heavily peddled the private goods of the Rightists. This article first praised Fei Xiaotong's "The Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" greatly. Everyone knows what Fei Xiaotong wrote in that article. He believed that before the Party proposed the policy of the Hundred Flowers Campaign, there was no spring, only severe cold and ice. Now, it was only early spring weather. Originally, this only reflected the feelings of Fei Xiaotong himself and a few backward elements, but when "New Observer" recounted this article, it praised it incessantly, saying:

"Mr. Fei Xiaotong's feelings have a certain representative significance because 'early spring' truly describes the mood of the intellectuals at that time. Since it is the climate of early spring, cold and warm are inevitably erratic." It also affirmed: "The metaphor of early spring weather is a unanimous view." Here, one can't help but ask, what viewpoint did "New Observer" use to observe and conclude that the early spring metaphor was consistent with everyone's views? Consistent with whom? Who does "everyone" refer to?

This article also spread the Rightists' thinking of fearing that the world would not be in chaos, wanting to deepen the rectification campaign to the grassroots level, and setting fires everywhere. The Rightists are insidiously trying to disrupt our rectification steps and fish in troubled waters. However, "New Observer" sang the same tune as them, quoting a professor who said: "The spring breeze of the Hundred Flowers Campaign only blows in institutions of higher learning and higher research institutions, only in big cities and big roofs. As for small and medium-sized cities, especially remote areas, they are outside the Jade Gate Pass. He hopes to see the new atmosphere of 'the sound of the Qiang flute leisurely accompanies the willows, and the spring breeze flies across the Jade Gate Pass.'" The editors of "New Observer" also felt that this issue was not prominent enough in the article, so they added a subtitle "The Spring Breeze Should Cross the Jade Gate Pass" with an affirmative tone. What is the intention?

The twelfth issue of "New Observer" published an article by the magazine's reporter, Li Jin, titled "Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?" The content of this article is full of anti-Party sentiment. Luo Sun's "Review of 'Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?'" on page 8 of the "People's Daily" on July 11th has already commented on it. Here, I want to ask "New Observer" why it held such great sympathy for Xiao Qian's erroneous remarks and such great dissatisfaction with Zhou Yang's past published reports and articles? It even questioned why the "Literary Gazette" did not discuss Zhou Yang's reports and articles. What was the intention of insisting that Ding Ling talk about her feelings and opinions on the rectification campaign?

I originally didn't know why "New Observer" had such a great interest in Fei Xiaotong. After reading Fei Xiaotong's speech at the People's Congress on July 9th, I understood a little bit. "New Observer" consecutively published Fei Xiaotong's long article "Revisiting Jiang Village" in the eleventh and twelfth issues. The eleventh issue was published on the front page in a prominent position. The size of the author's signature was rare. I casually checked "New Observer" for the past two or three months and haven't found any name that could match the size of the three characters "Fei Xiaotong." If that wasn't enough, the editors were afraid that it wouldn't be prominent enough or valued by readers, so they added an editor's note in bold type. The editor's note said: This is Mr. Fei Xiaotong's "detailed investigation of the current life of farmers, proposing ways to further improve the lives of farmers." Look at how highly the editors praised Fei Xiaotong! But what exactly did Fei Xiaotong write in this article?

Fei Xiaotong started by saying that there was not enough food, children could not afford to go to school, and so on. He said that if someone asked him, "The rural areas you were familiar with in the past must have changed a lot. How has the life of the farmers improved?" He would answer: "If the appearance refers to the nature of society, especially the aspect of production relations... in this respect, the appearance of this rural area has undergone fundamental changes and is completely different from the past... If the appearance refers to the living standards of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, I am a little hesitant and don't know how to say it."

His article clearly said that although the social system has changed, life has not improved. Isn't this a slander against the socialist system?

I would also like to trace back to the past. The first issue of "New Observer" in 1957 published a reporter's interview with the Zhengzhou State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3, titled "The Demands of Female Workers." This article greatly slandered the State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3, portraying it as hell. It said that if employees were sick, no one cared. They were not allowed to ask for leave even when they were sick. There were no houses to live in, and many people lived in corridors and kitchens. There were many bedbugs in the dormitories, and no one cared if they were bitten and couldn't sleep. The dining hall was full of flies and smelled terrible. Female workers were not given sanitary paper when they had their periods. And so on. When the kind reporter visited, the female workers could only shed tears when they saw him. The worst part was the illustrations in this article. One picture showed a dormitory building, which was so crowded that the dormitory building was crying. Another picture showed two employees entering the cafeteria wearing gas masks, and the surroundings were full of flies and mosquitoes. People really can't understand why "New Observer" exaggerated the shortcomings to such an extent.

This article was appreciated by the reactionary Hong Kong newspaper "Hong Kong Times." The newspaper reprinted the full text in a prominent position on January 20th, and printed the illustrations as they were. It publicized it with a prominent headline. What has the publication of such articles by the editors of "New Observer" brought to the Party and the people? Have you thought about it?

In short, the recent performance of "New Observer" has been very bad, causing dissatisfaction among readers. After the "Wenhui Daily" examined the bourgeois direction, the "Literary Gazette" also made an examination, while "New Observer" did not make a preliminary examination until the fourteenth issue published on July 16th, and began to publish anti-Rightist articles and cartoons. We welcome this correction and believe that, under the leadership of the Party, it can return to the correct path. We look forward to it answering all the readers who care about it with facts.

### 质问“新观察”

    质问“新观察”
    林今
    “新观察”最近发表了不少反社会主义和煽动性的文章，这些言论和右派的思想一脉相承，表现了编辑部严重的右倾思想。
    五月十六日出版的第十期“新观察”发表该刊对百家争鸣的综合报道，题为“蓓蕾满园乍开时”一文，便是大量地贩卖了右派的私货。这篇文章首先把费孝通的“知识分子的早春天气”一文大大赞美了一番。大家都知道费孝通在那篇文章中写了些什么，他认为在党提出百家争鸣的方针以前，没有春天，有的只是严寒和冰冻，现在也只不过是早春天气而已。本来这只是反映费孝通个人以及极少数落后分子的心情，但“新观察”在复述这篇文章时，以赞美不绝的口吻说：
  “费孝通先生的感受，是有一定的代表意义的。因为‘早春’确实说明了知识分子当时的心情。既然是早春的气候，就不免寒暖无常。”他又肯定地说：“早春天气的譬喻，看法大家一致。”这里人们不觉要问，“新观察”用什么观点进行观察，而得出结论说早春的比喻是和大家的看法一致呢？和谁“一致”呢？“大家”是指谁呢？
    这篇文章还传播了右派分子唯恐天下不乱，想把整风深入到基层，到处放火的思想。右派分子居心阴险，企图打乱我们的整风步骤，混水摸鱼。但“新观察”却和他们一鼻孔出气，引证一个教授的话，说：“百家争鸣的春风只吹高等学府，高等研究机关，只刮大城市，大屋顶，至于中小城市特别是偏辟地区，却在玉门关外，他希望能见到‘羌笛悠然伴杨柳，春风飞渡玉门关’的新气象。”新观察编者还嫌这个问题在文章中不够突出，还用肯定的口吻冠以小标题“春风应渡玉门关”。用意何在？
    “新观察”的第十二期，发表该刊记者李今“为什么‘放’得不够”一文。这篇文章的内容充满着反党情绪，7月11日“人民日报”的第八版罗荪“评‘为什么放得不够’”已有所评论。我在这里要问新观察为什么对萧乾的错误言论抱着那么大的同情，而对周扬过去发表的报告和文章那么大的不满？甚至要质问“文艺报”为什么不对周扬的报告和文章进行讨论。对于丁玲为什么一定要她谈关于整风的感受和意见，这是什么居心？
    我原来还不知道“新观察”为什么对费孝通发生这样大的兴趣，看到报载费孝通7月9日在人大的发言，才多少知道一点由头。“新观察”第十一、第十二期连续发表了费孝通“重访江村”的长文。第十一期是以首页显要地位刊载的。作者署名字体之大是少见的。我顺手查了两三个月以来的“新观察”，还没有发现任何一个名字能比得上“费孝通”这三个字大。这还不算，编者还怕不突出，怕不被读者所重视，又加了编者按语，用黑体字排出。编者的按语说：这是费孝通先生对“当前农民生活进行了详细调查，提出进一步改善农民生活的办法”。请看，编者对费孝通捧得如何之高呀！可是，费孝通在这篇文章里究竟写些什么呢？
    费孝通他一开头就说粮食不够，小孩上不起学等等。他说如果有人问他“你过去熟悉的农村，面貌一定大不同了，农民的生活改善得怎样了？”他便答道：“如果面貌是指社会性质，特别是生产关系那一方面……在这方面这个农村的面貌已起根本变化，和过去完全不同了。……如果面貌是指衣食住行的生活水平，我还有点犹豫，不知怎样说好。”
    他这篇文章明明是说社会制度虽然改变了，但生活并没有改善，这不是对社会主义制度的诬蔑吗？
    我还想追溯到以前，1957年第一期“新观察”发表该刊记者访问郑州国棉三厂的访问记“女工们的要求”。这篇文章对国棉三厂进行极大的诬蔑，把它描写成为地狱一样。他说职工生病，无人过问，病了还不准请假；没有房子住，不少人住在走廊和厨房里；宿舍里臭虫多，咬得无法入睡，也没人过问；饭厅充满了苍蝇，臭气冲天；女工来了月经，也不给草纸；等等不一而足。而当那位善良的记者访问时，女工见他就只有流眼泪。最恶劣的是这篇文章中的几幅插画。一幅是画着一个宿舍楼，因为人多，挤得这个宿舍楼直哭。另一幅是画着二个职工进入食堂时，带着防毒面具，而四周尽是苍蝇和蚊子。人们真不可理解，“新观察”为什么把缺点夸张到如此程度。
    这篇文章得到了香港反动的报纸“香港时报”的赏识。该报在1月20日便以显要地位将全文转载，并且把那几幅插画原样付印出来。它以显赫的标题，大事宣传。“新观察”的编者发表这样文章，给党和人民带来什么，你想过么？
    总之，最近一个时期来，“新观察”的表现是很恶劣的，是引起读者们的不满的。在文汇报检查了资产阶级方向之后，文艺报也作了检查，而“新观察”直到7月16日出版的第十四期上，才作了初步检查，开始发表反右派的文章和漫画。我们欢迎这个改正，相信它，在党的领导下能够回到正确的道路上来，我们更期待它用事实来答复所有关心它的读者们。
