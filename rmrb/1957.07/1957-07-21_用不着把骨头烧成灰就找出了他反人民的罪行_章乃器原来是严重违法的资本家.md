(Reported by this newspaper) The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) Central Committee and the ACFIC Standing Committee jointly held an enlarged meeting on the 20th to further expose and criticize Zhang Naiqi's consistent words and actions against the leadership of the Communist Party and against socialism. Zhang Naiqi evaded criticism against him, refused to attend the meeting, and wrote to the ACFIC Central Committee and the ACFIC, denouncing these two organizations and others' help to him as "insult, abuse, slander, and suppression," believing that such a meeting "cannot solve the problem" and is "useless for both public and private purposes." He even believes that the current criticism of him is "the bourgeois political parties' practice of harming others for their own benefit, and deception and intrigue."

Zhang Naiqi's stubborn attitude of adhering to a reactionary stance aroused great indignation among those present. Li Zhuchen, who presided over the meeting in the morning, said: Zhang Naiqi's stubborn attitude is intolerable. We must thoroughly expose and criticize his reactionary words and deeds; his sins cannot be covered up in front of the people of the whole country.

    **During Land Reform, He Always Considered the Landlord Class**
    **Believed That the Landlord Class Should Have Loyal Ministers and Martyrs**

Xu Chonglin, Acting Director of the ACFIC Sichuan Provincial Working Committee, said that Zhang Naiqi's understanding of the land reform completely lacked a sense of class distinction between the enemy and ourselves. For example, regarding the issue of compensation for landlords, he believed that there was no legal basis.

Meng Qiujiang, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was the secretary-general of the Southwest Land Reform Visiting Group at that time and a witness to Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party activities of engaging in "peaceful land reform" in 1951. He said, first, Zhang Naiqi created trouble in land reform and spread the fallacy of peaceful land reform everywhere. He almost turned the land reform in the fourth district of Hechuan County, Sichuan, into a peaceful land reform area. Meng Qiujiang said that Zhang Naiqi initially wanted to carry out peaceful land distribution and take his reformist path. He wanted to create a miracle to prove that his theory was superior to that of the Communist Party. Therefore, the policy he implemented in the land reform was to strictly prohibit beating people, but he was unwilling to implement the fundamental policy of fully mobilizing the peasants. Zhang Naiqi also personally drafted and issued circulars to promote his practices to teams in southern, western, and northern Sichuan.

Second, he resisted the leadership of the Party in the Southwest Bureau. To timely correct this crisis of peaceful land reform, the Southwest Bureau issued instructions, believing that it did not conform to the Party and government's policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and thoroughly defeating the prestige of the landlord class. Zhang Naiqi was not convinced by this instruction. To resist the instructions of the Southwest Bureau, he incited members and personally visited peasants in villages to collect materials to prove that the masses had been basically mobilized and the landlords had been basically defeated. Later, at a meeting convened by the Hechuan County Land Reform Committee, he was criticized for this view. After the meeting, he said indignantly: The stubborn resistance of the big landlords is the struggle that a class should have when it is eliminated, and said: Shouldn't there be loyal ministers and martyrs in the landlord class?

Third, he competed for the leadership of land reform. According to regulations, members of the land reform work team should be under the leadership of the local authorities. However, Zhang Naiqi emphasized "joint responsibility" with the local land reform leading organs, wanting to form a dual leadership.

Zhou Shiguan, a Standing Committee member of the ACFIC Central Committee, exposed Zhang Naiqi's activities in forming small cliques within the ACFIC. He said that Xu Hansan, the "dog-headed military advisor" of Zhang's small clique, used his position in the Propaganda and Education Department of the ACFIC Central Committee to win over figures from all sides for Zhang Naiqi, and boasted that Zhang Naiqi's hard work was unmatched even by Communist Party members. He also used Lin Difei to undermine the internal unity of the ACFIC and attack those who were unwilling to cooperate with him. He used Ding Yuchang to run "Minxun," and articles that differed from his opinions were not allowed to be published. He also had close relationships with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. After returning from Beidaihe, he told Xu Hansan that Premier Zhou said that a two-house system was going to be implemented. This was obviously a rumor.

    **Tax Evasion and Concealment of Enemy Property After Liberation**

Wu Gengmei said that from the preparation of the ACFIC before liberation to the present, Zhang Naiqi's thoughts and actions against socialism have remained unchanged. When preparing for the establishment of the ACFIC, Zhang Naiqi advocated "not leaning to the right, not favoring the left," and "must adopt a balanced policy towards the United States and the Soviet Union," vainly attempting to take the middle road and turn the ACFIC into a large bourgeois political party. Later, although he superficially supported the Communist Party, he then wanted to usurp the leadership of the ACFIC. His strategy was: to exploit the weaknesses of the industrial and commercial circles, to attack the heart, to win over the upper levels, to capture the masses, to focus on attracting large industrialists and businessmen, and to concentrate on attacking large cities. Since the year before last, he has spread the fallacy of the "red bourgeoisie," taking advantage of inspection opportunities to "set fires" everywhere in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Baoding, inciting the industrial and commercial circles to resist reform.

Wu Gengmei then listed Zhang Naiqi's fourteen illegal crimes after liberation. Wu Gengmei said that Shangchuan Company, operated by Zhang Naiqi, had business activities in Shanghai and Beijing after liberation, but Zhang Naiqi evaded industrial and commercial control, attempting to evade all taxes. This company was an unregistered black household in Shanghai with no accounts, failing to pay taxes on profits and pretending to be a traveling merchant when doing business to pay taxes as a sedentary merchant; it was a "black black household" in Beijing. At the end of 1951, when Shangchuan Enterprise Company's business in Shanghai had not yet ended, Zhang Naiqi violated state laws to avoid industrial and commercial control and tax evasion, and did not re-evaluate Shangchuan Enterprise Company's property to adjust capital. Among the shareholders of Shangchuan Enterprise Company, there were the properties of counter-revolutionaries, but Zhang Naiqi not only concealed them without exposing them, but also helped these counter-revolutionaries withdraw the money from the Shangchuan Enterprise Company and deposit it in the bank when the Shangchuan Enterprise Company ended. In 1956, Zhang Naiqi closed Shangchuan Enterprise Company on his own, without accounting for anything, not only evading state taxes but also infringing on the rights and interests of the shareholders of Shangchuan Enterprise Company. Wu Gengmei also revealed that Zhang Naiqi used Shangchuan Enterprise Company's name to invest in a Shanghai popular culture publishing house run by a counter-revolutionary (who had been suppressed by the People's Government).

Zi Yaohua revealed in his speech that before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Naiqi instructed his cousin, Kuomintang secret agent Ye Yansun, to gather a group of secret agents to surround and threaten the board of directors of Shangchuan Industrial Company, which was invested in by Shanghai Bank, and extorted 50,000 US dollar savings bonds. He established Shangchuan Enterprise Company in Hong Kong and engaged in large-scale speculation in stocks and real estate. He lent 10,000 Hong Kong dollars of the extorted money to China Standard Pencil Factory, which was run by Wu Gengmei. In early 1950, Wu Gengmei asked Zhang Naiqi, who was then an advisor to the People's Bank of China, to fraudulently obtain a loan from the People's Bank of China in the name of developing production at the China Pencil Factory. Wu used this money to repay his private debts and his own advances, as well as Zhang Naiqi's 10,000 Hong Kong dollars. Zhang Naiqi used this money to hoard antiques in Beijing. Zi Yaohua believed that Zhang Naiqi's behavior of defrauding loans for others to repay private debts violated the financial management laws of the People's Government and also violated the foreign exchange control laws of the People's Government.

Zi Yaohua said: After Zhang Naiqi returned to China from Hong Kong, he began to hoard antiques in Beijing. His Shangchuan Enterprise Company even secretly engaged in black market speculation. When people asked him why he bought so many antiques, he said something from the heart: "See how the political situation is, and make some economic calculations." From this sentence, it is clear that he thought that the People's Government might not be able to stand firm, and the Renminbi would collapse sooner or later. If the Renminbi became waste paper, his property and antiques would still be valuable, and if the People's Government collapsed, his future would still be good.

Li Wenjie said that Zhang Naiqi has always been deeply disgusted with the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and there is a reason for this. Shangchuan Enterprise Company, in which Zhang Naiqi invested the most, has always evaded industrial and commercial management and evaded industrial and commercial taxes.

On January 20, 1956, Zhang Naiqi talked to Secretary-General Wang Jihua and me. He said: Before liberation, he opened Shangchuan Enterprise Company in Hong Kong and Shanghai; after liberation, he participated in national work, and this company no longer had business activities, no staff, and no office, and did not register with the government for industry and commerce. Facts prove that this is completely a lie. He deliberately concealed the facts in order to deceive the tax bureau, to evade handing over accounts and going through liquidation procedures, and to evade paying illegal liquidation income tax. He said that after liberation, Shangchuan Company had an office in Shanghai, located at Anli Building, the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, and the person in charge was Xia Yi. Dai Jiaying also served for a period of time. The procedures for returning dividends last year were handled by Xia Yi in Beijing in conjunction with Dai Jiaying. After liberation, Shangchuan Company sent Dai Jiaying to Wuhu to do rice business; invested in Tongcheng Grain Store; and also engaged in the business of lending and earning interest. In 1950, Zhang Naiqi accepted Wu Gengmei's repayment of more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in Beijing on behalf of China Standard Pencil Factory for the factory's debt to Shangchuan Company in Hong Kong, without following the procedures of the foreign exchange management regulations. This matter has been requested by the ACFIC Central Committee to the Bank of China for explanation, confirming that this is a violation of foreign exchange regulations. Gan Bolin, the person in charge of Shangchuan Company's Hong Kong office, said that he had remitted 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in surplus funds to Zhang Naiqi. Zhang Naiqi bought antiques in large quantities with the funds of Shangchuan Company. According to the understanding of antique dealers, a total of more than 50,000 yuan (now worth more than 60,000 yuan) was used. If it was his own behavior, it was embezzlement of the company's funds. If it was done on behalf of the company, there should be accounting records (Dai Jiaying said that Zhang Naiqi donated antiques in the name of Shangchuan Enterprise Company, which means that Shangchuan Company bought the antiques without doubt. However, the antique dealer also said that the sales slip was written with Mr. Zhang's name). Antique transactions often have inflows and outflows. Judging from the fact that Zhang Naiqi once suggested that the Central Financial and Economic Commission of the former State Council establish an antique export company, there would be buying and selling activities. Now we have found that there are indeed sales activities and tax evasion. Last year, three batches of porcelain and bronze ware were sold, earning a total of more than 1,000 yuan, and evading more than 90 yuan in taxes.

The above situation proves that Shangchuan Company was indeed an enterprise unit after liberation, and it should have gone through industrial and commercial registration procedures with the local industrial and commercial administrative organs and tax bureau in accordance with the law, and paid various taxes related to business. Otherwise, it is an illegal black household that attempts to evade industrial and commercial management and evade tax payment. Refusing to go through procedures for closing down, liquidation, and paying taxes in accordance with the law is completely illegal. Although the series of illegal activities committed by Zhang Naiqi are economic, they constitute conditions for violating laws and discipline and fully expose his ugly political nature. Wu Gengmei and I have submitted a written report to the Joint Working Committee of the two organizations, requesting that it be forwarded to the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance and relevant agencies to take action, thoroughly investigate, and handle in a timely manner to safeguard the law and discipline. We also personally went to the State Taxation Administration to report. Zhang Naiqi shamelessly said that even if his bones were burned to ashes, there would not be a bit of anti-Party, anti-socialist dregs. From the facts we have revealed, combined with the facts revealed and reported by many comrades and the people of the whole country, we can say that if Zhang Naiqi's bones are burned to ashes, in addition to the ugliest things unique to the bourgeoisie, there is nothing else.

    **Zhang Naiqi's Small Clique Set Fires Everywhere, Inciting the Industrial and Commercial Circles to Resist Reform**

Pu Jiexiu, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the ACFIC, exposed that Zhang Naiqi and his right-wing small clique were setting fires everywhere in Beijing, carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies.

In April this year, at a symposium on propaganda and education work held by the ACFIC Central Committee, Zhang Naiqi, on the one hand, published anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies to confuse people. On the other hand, he colluded with Zhang Yongkang, the secretary of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the ACFIC, to arbitrarily distribute Wu Jincui's reactionary article "What to Learn from the Working Class" at the meeting. At that time, Zhang Naiqi greatly praised Wu Jincui's article and recommended it to be publicly published in the Dagongbao. He lit a big fire against the Party and socialism in the industrial and commercial circles. Subsequently, Zhang Naiqi's confidant, Xu Hansan, used his legitimate position as the deputy director of the Propaganda and Education Department of the ACFIC Central Committee to collude with the right-wing element Zhang Yongkang, deceiving the leaders, and jointly convening a series of symposiums in the name of the ACFIC Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee, setting fires everywhere.

After Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks at the guidance meeting on industrial and commercial reform held by the ACFIC Central Committee, Zhang Naiqi's followers Zhang Huanyao, Yan Shaoqing, Wu Jincui, Zhang Yongkang, and others became even more arrogant, running around to spread Zhang Naiqi's reactionary arguments, echoing from top to bottom, and launching a rampant attack on the Party and the people. Zhang Naiqi said: "Fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income." Yan Shaoqing said that fixed interest is the reward for the industrial and commercial circles to surrender. Zhang Huanyao said that fixed interest is the measure fee for socialist construction. Deng Jixing advocated issuing nationalization bonds, and Wu Jincui also advocated "paying off in one lump sum with ordinary bonds to eliminate traces." They stirred up ideological confusion in the industrial and commercial circles.

Zhang Naiqi also placed his confidants everywhere to expand his influence. For example, Yuan Muru, his subordinate in the pseudo-Finance Department of Anhui Province, was introduced by him to work in the State Taxation Administration in 1950. Yuan Muru took advantage of the opportunity to speak out this time, echoing Zhang Naiqi and spreading many anti-Party remarks.

Jing Shuping, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, used many facts to illustrate that Zhang Naiqi's problem is not a problem of thought, nor a problem of theory, but a problem of political action.

At the end of May 1956, when Zhang Naiqi inspected Shanghai as a representative of the National People's Congress, he convened a symposium for the leaders of the Shanghai ACFIC and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. At the meeting, he incited industrialists and businessmen, saying that their "enthusiasm" had not been brought into play because they had a sense of inferiority and had not yet raised their heads. Here, he vividly introduced that he had power and authority in the Ministry of Food as a result of constantly "fighting" with Party members. He also said that his secret to inspecting work was: advocating that people complain and encouraging people to complain. The more complaints people made, the greater his capital.

After spreading poison in Shanghai, Zhang Naiqi went to Hangzhou to carry out the same activities. According to the materials recently revealed in various places, he also used the name of inspection to set fires in the industrial and commercial circles in other places.

Wang Xingyao revealed in his speech the adverse effects of Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. He said that when the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Political School was discussing the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, everyone initially agreed that it had a dual nature. However, after Zhang Naiqi's article was published, many people changed their tune, saying that the dual nature no longer existed. They even began to doubt the school's curriculum, saying that the political school was dogmatic, and the learning mood was greatly reduced. A student, Huang Miaofu, said that only Zhang Naiqi was truly the leader of the industrial and commercial circles, and his remarks hit "people's hearts, and were what many people wanted to say but did not say." After Huang Miaofu issued his absurd "declaration," Zhang Naiqi also wrote to him to support him. After receiving this letter, Huang spread rumors everywhere, saying that he would continue to speak out boldly. He also printed his third "declaration" into many booklets, distributing them everywhere, even abroad. After being subjected to a massive counterattack, Huang Miaofu mentioned in several self-criticisms that he was poisoned by Zhang Naiqi.

Yao Shunfu, with the title "Insidious and Vicious Rightist Zhang Naiqi," revealed Zhang Naiqi's wanton fire-setting in the Hangzhou ACFIC in June 1956.

Zhang Naiqi said in Hangzhou that he always felt that there were still many people in the industrial and commercial circles who only raised their heads halfway and had not completely raised them, and their sense of inferiority was quite a burden. He said that he met several people in the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai this time, and they felt ashamed to see people when they talked about exploiting workers in the past. He told them that it was not good to always remember these things, and they should throw away the burden after one self-criticism. It is not good to only raise your head halfway. Zhang Naiqi also said that he heard in Beijing that they wanted to open up completely, "I think some people in the industrial and commercial circles only opened up halfway, that is, half of self-criticism, and the other half of criticizing others has not been opened up. I think what you have to say you have to say, and what you have to fart you have to fart, it's not good to keep it in your stomach. The ACFIC and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should encourage them to open up. One thing is certain today, there is no crime for speaking." Zhang Naiqi made a big fuss under such remarks, saying that democratic parties should care more about people, not only about the past depression and complaints, but more importantly, about the current life and work, whether they have positions and powers? How to represent people's legitimate interests.

Zhang Naiqi also said in Hangzhou that he had two questions: one is the communist moral character, and the other is the working class moral character. He said that some people regard the working class's character as unattainable and mysterious. In fact, workers are also people, and communists are also people. Zhang Naiqi also said, "I met a woman who said she wanted to marry a communist husband, I think 'longing for Chang'an from the west' is a lesson for her." "Once ownership is changed, everyone is a socialist citizen."

Yang Meizhen attended yesterday's meeting and expressed her desire to draw a line with Zhang Naiqi and join the ranks of anti-rightists. But when she said she wanted to expose Zhang Naiqi's reactionary words and deeds, she only listed some trivial things and did not explain anything, as she herself said: "The content is poor." On the contrary, she pretended not to know Zhang Naiqi's reactionary activities, defended him, and exonerated herself.

    **Zhang Naiqi's Speech at the National People's Congress Was a False Self-Criticism and a Real Attack**

Wang Guangying said that Zhang Naiqi's self-criticism at the National People's Congress was a false self-criticism and a real attack.

In his so-called self-criticism at the "NPC," Zhang Naiqi did his best to curse, distort, incite, and counterattack. He said that "for the past eight years, I have had no doubts about the Party's guidelines and policies," and that he would be "loyal to the Party and to socialism until death," which is lying with his eyes open. He said in his self-criticism that "the national bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature - I did not say that." Good! You wrote black characters on white paper, from the Second Plenary Session of the ACFIC last year to this year's bold speaking out, how much did you talk about, the evidence is all there, and you still say "did not say that."

Bi Mingqi, the vendor of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks, once said your intention: "This is a fundamental problem, if this problem is won over, then all problems will be solved." Zhang Naiqi has been fighting for several years to deny class existence, deny class relations, and deny the Party's leadership from this problem, and shake our foundation as his theoretical basis for opposing the Party and opposing socialism. Now you feel the seriousness of this problem, so you categorically deny that you have ever said that the national bourgeoisie does not have a dual nature, which is reasonable.

Zhang Naiqi said: "Some people believe 'public opinion can melt gold'; Zeng Shen killed someone, repeated three times, and the loving mother was shaken... Today I believe: 'Real gold is not afraid of fire.' With the leadership of the Communist Party, we will definitely be able to distinguish right from wrong." Isn't his meaning obvious? To say that all those who give him opinions are "lies" that slander him, and that the Communist Party is biased and believes in rumors, this is the greatest slander against the Party, the people of the whole country, and the industrial and commercial circles of the whole country! We must resolutely fight Zhang Naiqi to the end.

Zhong Lüguang, in response to Yang Meizhen's speech, welcomed her to participate in the meeting against the rightist leader Zhang Naiqi. But she raised objections to the content of her speech. She hoped that Yang Meizhen, as a woman of New China, should be strong, not hypocritical, and carefully examine her position, draw a line with Zhang Naiqi, and explain the specific facts of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary activities that she knows.

Then, Zhong Lüguang also revealed that Zhang Naiqi had introduced and placed Kuomintang secret agents to the ACFIC, some of whom had been arrested, and Zhang Naiqi still had contacts with people with unclear political backgrounds from time to time. She asked Zhang Naiqi to come to the meeting next time to explain.

Hu Ziang, who presided over the meeting in the afternoon, read a letter to the ACFIC from Sun Caiping, who was insulted by Zhang Naiqi. In her letter, she accused Zhang Naiqi of reactionary crimes and corrupt bourgeois morality. At the same time, he read out the opinions raised by the participants on Yang Meizhen's speech. Many people expressed dissatisfaction with Yang Meizhen's speech. They hoped that she would stand firm, draw a clear line, help Zhang Naiqi reflect, change his arrogant attitude, and not be obsessed and resist everyone's help to him.

Hu Ziang said that Zhang Naiqi is resisting reform, and if this continues, he will only isolate himself from the people. Finally, he firmly expressed his determination to fight the rightist reactionary leader Zhang Naiqi to the end and never stop until victory.

Another News: At the enlarged meeting jointly held by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the ACFIC Central Committee yesterday, Dai Pianying exposed the consistent reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Bi Mingqi. She said that Bi Mingqi once said to her: It is formalism for leading comrades to participate in physical labor. Only Party members participate in labor, and there are no members of democratic parties, so that the democratic parties are not allowed to establish prestige. He also provoked the relationship between peasants and the Party and the government, saying that if the peasants' grain problem is not solved, the peasants will rise up, and if they rise up, it will be terrible. He spread rumors that the Federation of Industry and Commerce was engaging in sectarianism. In fact, he was engaging in small cliques and attacking activists. Xu Shuhua, Zhao Tianjue, Gao Youshan, and Mi Luzhai are all figures in his small clique. He has always praised Zhang Naiqi, saying that Zhang is a theorist, has combativeness, and is the wholesaler of his reactionary remarks.

### 用不着把骨头烧成灰就找出了他反人民的罪行  章乃器原来是严重违法的资本家

专栏：

    用不着把骨头烧成灰就找出了他反人民的罪行
    章乃器原来是严重违法的资本家
    本报讯　民建中央和全国工商联常委会，20日联合举行扩大会议，进一步揭发和批判了章乃器一贯反对共产党领导和反对社会主义的言论和行动。章乃器逃避对他的批判，拒不出席会议，并且写信给民建中央和全国工商联，把这两个组织和别人对他的帮助诬为对他的“侮辱、谩骂、诽谤、压制”，认为这样的会议“不能解决问题”，“对公对私都是无益的”。他甚至认为目前对他的批判是“资产阶级政党的损人利己、尔诈我虞的风气”。
    章乃器的这种坚持反动立场的顽固态度，引起了到会者的极大愤慨。上午主持会议的李烛尘说：章乃器的顽固态度是不能容忍的。我们必须彻底地揭发和批判他的反动言行，他的罪恶在全国人民的面前是掩盖不了的。
    土改当中处处为地主阶级着想
    认为地主阶级应该有忠臣烈士
    民建四川省工作委员会代主任委员徐崇林说，章乃器对土改的认识完全没有敌我界限。例如，对地主赔罚问题，他认为没有法律根据。
    政协天津市委副主席孟秋江是当时西南土改参观团的秘书长，是1951年章乃器搞“和平土改”的反党活动的见证人。他说，第一、章乃器在土改中遇事生非，到处散布和平土改的谬论。几乎把四川合川县四区的土改搞成和平土改区。孟秋江说，章乃器一开始就想搞和平分田，走他的改良主义的路。他想创造一个奇迹，来证明他的理论比共产党高明。因此，他在土改中贯彻的政策，就是严禁打人这一条，而充分发动农民的根本政策，他却不愿贯彻。章乃器还把他的作法亲自拟发通报，向川南、川西、川北各队推广。
    第二、反抗西南局党的领导。西南局为了及时纠正这种和平土改的危机，曾发出指示，认为是不符合党和政府放手发动群众、彻底打垮地主阶级威风的政策。章乃器对这个指示是不服气的。他为了抵抗西南局的指示，煽动团员并亲自下村访问农民，收集材料，证明群众基本上已发动，地主基本上已打垮。后来，在合川县土改委员会召集的一次会议上，批判了他这种观点。会后他愤愤地说：大地主的顽抗，是一个阶级被消灭时应有的挣扎，并且说：难道地主阶级中就不应该有忠臣烈士吗？
    第三、争夺土地改革的领导权。按规定，土改工作团团员应受当地领导。可是章乃器，却强调与当地土改领导机关“共同负责”，想因此形成双重领导。
    民建中央常务委员周士观揭发章乃器在民建内部搞小集团的活动。他说，章的小集团的狗头军师许汉三，利用在民建中央宣教处工作之便，为章乃器拉拢各方面的人物，并且吹嘘说章乃器的努力工作是共产党员都赶不上的。他还利用林涤非来破坏民建会内部的团结，打击不肯同他合作的人。他利用丁裕长搞“民讯”，凡是不同于他的意见的文章都不准刊载。他和章伯钧、罗隆基也有密切关系，从北戴河回来以后，他曾经告诉许汉三，周总理说是要搞两院制。这显然是造谣。
    解放后偷税漏税隐匿敌产
    吴羹梅说，从解放前筹备民建会开始直到现在，章乃器反对社会主义的思想和行动仍然原封未动，没有什么改变。在筹建民建会时，章乃器标榜“不右倾，不左袒”，“对于美苏两国，必须采取平衡政策”，妄想走中间路线，把民建会搞成一个资产阶级大政党。后来他虽然表面上被迫拥护共产党，但接着就想篡夺民建会的领导权。他的策略是：对工商界利用弱点，攻心为上，笼络上层，俘掳群众，着重拉拢大工商业者，集中进攻大城市。从前年起他就大放“红色资产阶级”的谬论，借视察机会在天津、上海、杭州、保定到处“放火”，煽动工商界抗拒改造。
    吴羹梅接着举出章乃器在解放后的十四点违法罪行。吴羹梅说，章乃器所经营的上川公司，解放后在上海、北京都有过业务活动，但章乃器逃避了工商管制，企图偷漏一切税款。这个公司在上海是个未登记没有账的黑户，有盈余不纳税，有营业时以坐商冒充行商缴税；在北京是个“黑黑户”。1951年底，上川企业公司在上海的业务还未结束，章乃器为了逃避工商管制和偷税漏税，违反国家法令，不重估上川企业公司财产调整资本。上川企业公司股东中有反革命分子的财产，章乃器不仅隐匿不揭发，而且在上川企业公司结束时，还替这些反革命分子把钱领出来存入银行。1956年章乃器自行结束上川企业公司，也无账目交代，不仅偷漏了国家税款，还侵占了上川企业公司股东们的权益。吴羹梅还揭露章乃器用上川企业公司名义，投资给一个反革命分子（已被人民政府镇压）主持的上海通俗文化出版社。
    资耀华在发言中揭露，章乃器在抗日战争胜利前，指使他的表弟、军统特务叶燕荪，纠集一批特务，包围、威胁上海银行所投资的上川实业公司董事会，敲诈了五万美金储蓄券，在香港成立了上川企业公司，大做股票地产投机倒把的生意。他把敲诈得来的钱借给吴羹梅所主持的中国标准铅笔厂港币一万元。1950年初，吴羹梅请托当时名为中国人民银行顾问的章乃器，假借中国铅笔厂发展生产为理由，向中国人民银行骗取了一笔贷款。吴用这笔钱归还了所借的私债和自己的垫款，也还了章乃器的一万元港币。章乃器就用这笔钱在北京囤集古董。资耀华认为，章乃器这种替别人骗取贷款用以归还私人债务的行为，违犯了人民政府的金融管理法令，又违犯了人民政府的外汇管理法令。
    资耀华说：章乃器从香港回国后，一到北京就大事囤集古董。他的上川企业公司，更偷偷摸摸地做黑市投机买卖。人家问他为什么买这么多的古董，他倒说了一句真心话：“看看政治行情，打打经济算盘。”从这句话看得很清楚，他以为人民政府不一定站得住，人民币迟早要垮台，万一人民币成了废纸，他的财产和古董还是完整值钱的，万一人民政府垮了台，他的前途还是很好的。
    李文杰发言说，章乃器一直对伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动反感很深，不是没有原因的。章乃器投资最多的上川企业公司，就一贯逃避工商管理、逃避工商税收。
    1956年1月20日，章乃器找秘书长王纪华同志和我谈话。他说：解放前，他在香港、上海开设上川企业公司；解放后，他参加国家工作，这个公司就不再有业务活动，也没有职员和办事处，也没有向政府办理工商业登记。事实证明这完全是谎言。他故意隐瞒事实，为的是蒙蔽税局，达到逃避交出账目并办理清算程序，逃避交纳清算所得税的不法目的。他说，解放后，上川公司在上海有办事处，设四川路九江路口安利大楼，负责人是夏沂，戴家瀛也服务过一个时期，去年发还股款的手续，就是夏沂来北京会同戴家瀛办理的。解放后，上川公司曾派戴家瀛去芜湖做过米粮生意；投资同成粮行；也曾做过拆放款项，赚取利息的营业行为。1950年章乃器曾接受吴羹梅代中国标准铅笔厂用人民币在北京归还该厂在香港对上川公司的欠款港币万余元，没有按照外汇管理法令的手续办理。这件事已由民建中常会函请中国银行解释，确认这是违反外汇法令的行为。上川公司香港办事处负责人甘伯林说，他曾以香港余款港币万元，汇给章乃器。章乃器以上川公司的款项大批收买古董，经向古董商了解，共用了人民币五万余元（现值六万多元），如系自己的行为，则是侵占公司的款项，如系代公司所做的行为，则应有经手账目（戴家瀛说，章乃器捐出古董，用上川企业公司名义，则是上川公司的买进行为无疑。但古董商又说，卖货发单上写的是章先生）。古董交易常是有进有出的。从章乃器曾建议原政务院中财委成立古董出口公司一件事来看，是会有买卖行为的。现在我们已查到确有卖出行为并逃避纳税，去年卖出瓷、铜器三批，共卖得一千余元，逃税九十余元。
    以上情况证明上川公司在解放后确是一个企业单位，就应该依法向当地工商行政管理机关及税局办理工商登记手续，缴纳营业有关的各种捐税，否则，就是一个企图逃避工商管理、逃避交纳税收的违法的黑户，拒不依法办理歇业、清算、交税等手续，是完全违法的勾当。章乃器所作出的一系列的违法勾当，虽是经济方面的，但已构成违法乱纪的条件，而且充分暴露了他的丑恶政治本质。我已和吴羹梅向两会联合工作委员会提出书面报告，要求转请财政部税务总局及有关机关采取行动，彻底清查，及时处理，以维法纪。我们并曾亲赴税务总局检举。章乃器老着面皮说，把他的骨头烧成灰，没有一点儿反党、反社会主义的渣滓，从我们所揭露的这些事实，结合许多同志和全国人民对于他的揭露和检举的事实来看，我们可以说，把章乃器的骨头烧成灰，除掉那些属于资产阶级所专有的最丑恶的东西之外，什么东西也没有。
    章乃器的小集团到处放火煽动工商界抗拒改造
    民建北京市主委浦洁修在发言中揭发了章乃器和他的右派小集团在北京处处点火，进行反党、反社会主义的阴谋活动的情况。
    章乃器在今年4月间民建中央召开的宣教工作座谈会上，一方面发表了反党反社会主义的谬论，进行蛊惑。另一方面，串通民建北京市委会宣教处秘书张永康，把北京工商界右派分子吴金萃的反动文章
  “向工人阶级学习什么”，擅自在会上印发。当时，章乃器对吴金萃的文章，大加赞赏，并推荐给大公报公开发表。在工商界中点了一把反党反社会主义的大火。随后，章乃器的亲信许汉三，便利用民建中常委宣教处副处长的合法地位，同右派分子张永康相勾结，欺骗领导，利用民建中央和北京市委会的名义，联合召开了一系列的座谈会，大肆放火。
    当章乃器在民建中央召开的工商改造辅导会议上的反动言论发表后，章乃器的喽啰们张焕尧、阎少青、吴金萃、张永康等更加嚣张，奔走相告，到处宣扬章乃器的反动论点，上下呼应，展开了向党向人民的猖狂进攻。章乃器说：“定息不是剥削，是不劳而获”，阎少青就说，定息是工商界缴械投降的奖励金。张焕尧说，定息是社会主义建设的措施费、邓季惺主张发国有化公债，吴金萃也主张“用普通公债一次发付，以此消灭痕迹”。在工商界掀起了思想的混乱。
    章乃器还四处安插自己的亲信，扩大他的影响。如他在安徽省伪财政厅的僚属袁穆如，就是由他在1950年介绍到税务总局工作的。袁穆如这次借鸣放的机会，同章乃器一呼一应，散布了很多反党言论。
    全国工商联副秘书长经叔平用许多事实说明，章乃器的问题不是思想问题，也不是理论问题，而是政治行动问题。
    1956年5月底，章乃器以全国人民代表大会的代表的身份到上海视察的时候，曾召集上海市民建和工商联的负责人举行座谈会。他在会上煽动工商业者，说他们的“积极性”没有发挥，是因为有自卑感，头还没有抬起来。在这里，他有声有色地介绍说，他在粮食部有职有权，是同党员不断“斗争”的结果。他还说，他视察工作的秘诀是：主张人家发牢骚，鼓励人家发牢骚。人们发的牢骚越多，他的本钱越大。
    章乃器在上海散播毒素以后，又到杭州进行了同样的活动。根据最近各地揭发的材料看，他还利用视察的名义，到其他地方的工商界中点过火。
    王性尧在发言中，揭露了章乃器的反党、反社会主义的言行造成的不良影响。他说，上海市工商界政治学校在讨论资产阶级的两面性的时候，最初，大家一致认为是有两面性的。但是，章乃器的文章发表以后，很多人便变了调子，说是两面性已经不存在了。并进而对学校的课程发生怀疑，说政治学校是教条主义，学习情绪大为低落。学员黄苗夫说，只有章乃器真正是工商界的领导者，他的言论句句打中“人们的心坎，是很多人要鸣而未鸣的。”黄苗夫发出了荒谬的“鸣文”后，章乃器还写信给他撑腰。黄接此信后，就到处招谣，表示还要继续大鸣大放。并且把他第三次的“鸣文”印成许多小册子，到处分发，甚至发到国外。黄苗夫在受到声势浩大的反击后，在几次检讨中都曾提到，他受了章乃器的毒素。
    姚顺甫以“阴险毒辣的右派分子章乃器”为题，揭发章乃器在1956年6月到杭州民建会大肆放火的情况。
    章乃器在杭州说，他总觉得工商界还有不少人的头只抬起半个，没有完全抬起来，自卑感包袱相当大。他这次在上海见到几位工商界人士，他们一讲起过去剥削工人的事就感到无脸见人。他就对他们说经常记这些不好，一次检讨就将包袱丢了。头只抬了一半不好。章乃器还说，在北京听到说要彻底敞开，“我看工商界有的只敞开一半，即自我批评的一半，批评人家的那一半还没有敞开。我认为话要说屁要放，闷在肚里不好。民建、工商联要鼓励他们敞开。有一条今天是肯定的，言者无罪。”章乃器在他这样的言论下大作文章说，民主党派对人要多多关心，不但是过去的苦闷牢骚，更重要的是眼前的生活和工作，是否有职有权？如何代表人们的合法利益。
    章乃器在杭州时还说，他有两个问题：一个是共产主义道德品质，一是工人阶级道德品质。他说，有的人将工人阶级的品质看得高不可攀，神秘莫测。实际上，工人也是人，共产党员也是人。章乃器又说，“我遇到一位女的，她说嫁个丈夫要共产党员，我看‘西望长安’对她就是教训。”“所有制一改变，大家就都是社会主义公民了。”
    杨美真出席了昨天的会议，并在会上发言表示她要和章乃器划清界限，投入反右派的行列里来。但是当她说要揭发章乃器的反动言行时，只是罗列一些琐碎的事情，并没有交代甚么，正如她自己所说：“内容贫乏”。相反，她还假装不知道章乃器的反动活动，为他辩护，并为自己解脱。
    章乃器在人代会上的发言是假检讨，真进攻
    王光英说，章乃器在人民代表大会上的检讨，是假检讨，真进攻。
    章乃器在“人大”的所谓检讨中，极尽谩骂，歪曲，煽动，反扑的能事。他说“八年来，我对党所提出的方针、政策是没有任何怀疑的”，是“到死都忠于党忠于社会主义的”，这是在睁着眼睛说瞎话。他的检讨中说“民族资产阶级已经没有两面性——我没有这样说过”。好！你在白纸上写黑字，去年民建二中全会到今年大鸣大放，你谈了多少，赃证俱在，还说“没有这样说过”。
    章乃器反动言行的贩卖商毕鸣岐曾说出你们的意图：“这是一个根本问题，这个问题争过来，那一切问题都解决了。”章乃器争了几年就是想从这个问题来否定阶级存在，否定阶级关系，来否定党的领导，动摇我们的根本做为他反党反社会主义的理论根据的。现在你觉得这个问题的严重了，所以你矢口否认曾说过民族资产阶级没有两面性是有道理的。
    章乃器说：“某些人相信‘众口可以烁金’；曾参杀人，重复了三次，慈母为之动摇……在今天我相信：‘真金不怕火’有了共产党的领导，一定可以明是非。”他的意思不是很明显吗？把所有对他提意见的人统统说成是诬蔑他的“谎言”，共产党是偏听偏信，这是对党对全国人民对全国工商界的最大诬蔑！我们一定与章乃器坚决斗争到底。
    钟履光针对杨美真的发言，表示欢迎她参加反右派头子章乃器的会议。但对她的发言内容提出意见。她希望杨美真做为新中国的一位妇女，应当坚强起来，不要虚伪，好好检查自己的立场，并同章乃器划清界限，把她所知道的章乃器反动活动的具体事实交代出来。
    接着钟履光还揭发了章乃器向民建介绍并安置过国民党特务，有的已被捕，章乃器还和政治面目不清的人时有往来。她要求章乃器下次到会上来交代。
    下午主持会议的胡子昂，在散会时，宣读了被章乃器辱弄的孙采苹给民建会的信。她在信中控诉章乃器的反动罪行和腐朽的资产阶级道德。同时宣读了与会的人对杨美真的发言提出的意见。许多人对杨美真的发言表示不满。希望她站稳立场，划清界限，帮助章乃器反省，改变他的骄横态度，不要执迷不悟，抗拒大家对他的帮助。
    胡子昂说，章乃器抗拒改造，这样下去，只有自绝于人民。最后他坚决表示要向右派反动头子章乃器斗争到底，不胜利，绝不收兵。
    又讯　在昨天全国工商联和民建中央常委会联合举行的扩大会议上，戴翩英揭发了右派分子毕鸣岐一贯的反动言行。她说，毕鸣岐曾经对她说过：领导同志参加体力劳动是形式主义，参加劳动的只是党员，没有民主党派的成员，是不让民主党派树立威信。他还挑拨农民同党和政府的关系，说什么农民的粮食问题如不解决，农民就要起来，起来了就不得了。他造谣说工商联闹宗派，其实是他自己在搞小集团，打击积极分子。许树华、赵天爵、高幼珊、米禄斋，都是他的小集团的人物。他一向是口口声声赞扬章乃器，说章是个理论家，有斗争性，是他的反动言论的批发商。
