    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has experienced a great and glorious thirty years amidst the storms of the Chinese revolution.
    Our army's thirty years of struggle have repeatedly proven that the most fundamental reason why we have been able to defeat powerful enemies at home and abroad with inferior equipment under extremely difficult conditions is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the correct leadership of the Party, there would be no victory for the Chinese revolution, and there would be no victory for our armed forces. The bourgeois rightists' clamoring for the "abolition" of the Party's leadership over the army merely exposes their vain attempt to oppose our country's socialism and restore capitalism.
    We know that as far back as the First Revolutionary Civil War, our Party began to participate in and lead armed struggles. At that time, the Party was in its infancy and lacked experience. At the critical juncture of the revolution, due to Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism dominating the Party, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang launched a counter-revolutionary coup, extinguishing the raging flames of the Great Revolution. Later, our Party quickly corrected this erroneous line and, based on the characteristics of Chinese society and the development of the Chinese revolution, determined the correct line of taking armed struggle as the main form of the Chinese revolution, and formulated the policy of first implementing rural base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and then seizing the cities. According to this policy and line, the Party immediately organized armed uprisings in several southern provinces after the failure of the Great Revolution, created the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, established revolutionary base areas and revolutionary regimes, and formulated a set of strategies, tactics, and political work systems suitable for China's conditions. Although conditions were extremely difficult at the time and the enemy's attacks were unusually frequent, we still persisted, continuously defeating the enemy's military offensives, and developing and strengthening the revolutionary forces. However, just as the revolution was moving forward, the Party was ruled by "Left"-leaning opportunism led by Wang Ming and Bo Gu. The erroneous line they implemented caused serious losses to the revolutionary base areas and the Red Army. It was not until the Zunyi Conference, convened by the Party Central Committee during the Long March, that this "Left"-leaning opportunist line was resolutely criticized and corrected, and Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in the Central Committee was established. Since then, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has implemented the correct political and military lines, so the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people's armed forces have achieved considerable development and great victory. After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, the Party led and united the people of the whole country, and used this people's armed forces to finally defeat the Japanese imperialists who invaded our country, defeat the eight million Kuomintang counter-revolutionary troops, overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and complete the great historical task of national democratic revolution. On the basis of this revolutionary victory, the Party then led the people of the whole country to carry out socialist revolution by peaceful means, and mobilized and organized the strength of the people of the whole country to strive to build our country into a great socialist country.
    After the victory of the national revolution, the Party led our army to carry out the glorious task of defending the socialist construction of the motherland, opposing imperialist aggression, and actively preparing to liberate Taiwan. In order to effectively carry out this task, our army, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and combined with the experience of Soviet army building, carried out the work of modernization and regularization. After several years of regularization construction and regular training, the military technology, political consciousness, and scientific and cultural level of our army's officers and soldiers have been significantly improved, and the organization and discipline of the troops have also been greatly enhanced. In particular, the brilliant victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea greatly enriched our army's operational experience in defeating imperialist armies equipped with modern technology. Now, our army not only has a strong army, but also a strong air force and navy. In addition, since our army has actively participated in and supported the work of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country in recent years, and several political and ideological transformation movements have been carried out within our army, this has greatly exercised and improved our army politically and ideologically, and various non-proletarian ideological consciousness has been constantly criticized and corrected. All this fully shows that our army's ability to achieve such great victories and achievements in defeating powerful enemies abroad and defending the socialist construction of the motherland is completely inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party. The rightists' conspiracy to "weaken" and "abolish" the Party's leadership over the army has been shattered by the thirty-year historical facts of our army!
    At present, our country is in a great historical period. In order to carry out the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country to defend the motherland and defend against imperialism, in addition to continuing to carry out modernization, it is more important to carry out in-depth socialist education for the vast number of officers and soldiers of the entire army, to strengthen the firm belief of every soldier in serving the cause of socialism and communism, and to correct various non-proletarian ideologies, especially bourgeois ideologies. Our country's socialist revolution was completed in a short period of a few years, and it adopted the method of peaceful transformation. Although our country's economic foundation has changed rapidly, people's ideological consciousness has not completely changed accordingly. The current anti-rightist struggle is a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology, and it is also an acute class struggle in politics and ideology. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out systematic socialist education and ideological transformation work for all personnel of the entire army, so that they can stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and firmly fight for the cause of communism in the great storms of social change.
    In order to strengthen socialist education, it is necessary to better organize the study of Marxist-Leninist theory by cadres. This study must be combined with the actual situation of China's revolution and construction, and must strive to study the Party's policy resolutions and Chairman Mao's works. Oppose the erroneous practice of only regarding Marxist-Leninist classics as theory, and regarding the Party's policy resolutions and Chairman Mao's works as "current affairs policies." We should combine these two to study. Because the Party's policy resolutions and Chairman Mao's works are models of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, we should study them carefully.
    We must see that the socialist revolution is about to involve the thoughts and lives of the people of the whole country. Due to the different class standpoints and political consciousness, the Party's various policies often have different reactions in everyone's minds. Our country's socialist revolution must not only eliminate classes and the system of exploitation, which we have basically done; but also achieve the complete victory of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, otherwise, there will be no hope for the victory of socialism. However, this socialist revolution in politics and ideology is, to some extent, a more complex and arduous task than overthrowing the reactionary rule of the exploiting classes. Therefore, every revolutionary soldier must not only withstand the test of war, but also withstand the test of the socialist revolution. In this revolutionary struggle, we should firmly stand on the proletarian socialist position and faithfully implement the Party's policy resolutions. At present, some erroneous views and confused thoughts on the issues of unified purchase and sale, agricultural collectivization, the living standards of workers and peasants, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries that exist in the troops, the individualism, liberalism, and anarchism, egalitarianism in the ideology of cadres, and the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism in the work style should all be seriously criticized and corrected. It should be clearly recognized that raising the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres is an important task of our army at present. Only when the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres is raised can our work be truly effective.
    In order to strengthen the socialist education of the entire army, it is necessary to create an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in the troops, first of all within the Party, and to oppose the phenomenon of only being willing to hear praise, not being willing to hear criticism, especially not being willing to hear criticism from subordinates and soldiers. Criticism and self-criticism are important driving forces for promoting our political and ideological progress. People must wash their faces every day to maintain cleanliness and hygiene; weapons must be wiped frequently to maintain combat readiness; we must conduct criticism and self-criticism frequently to correct mistakes in a timely manner. Our criticism starts from the desire for unity, is to help comrades make progress rather than malicious attacks; is to consolidate our discipline rather than weaken discipline, is to enhance the unity of our army rather than hinder unity. The rightists vainly attempt to use the weapon of "criticism" to attack us, with the aim of weakening the leadership of our Party and the discipline of our army, and undermining our unity. We must resolutely fight back against this so-called "criticism." And for all well-intentioned criticisms, all correct and reasonable parts should be accepted, and errors in our thinking and work should be corrected based on these opinions; for erroneous criticisms, unreasonable opinions, or opinions that are reasonable but cannot be done temporarily, we should also make patient explanations.
    Our army's thirty-year history has fully proven that the Party's correct leadership is the decisive factor for our army's victory. In the future, the tasks undertaken by our army are still heavy and arduous. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen the socialist education of all officers and soldiers of the entire army, make our army politically and ideologically stronger and more united, make the relationship between the army, the army and the people, and the government more intimate, and make the enthusiasm of the entire army to learn modern military science and technology higher, so that we will be more powerful and more confident to complete the glorious historical tasks assigned to us by the Party and the country.

    党的领导是我军胜利的决定因素
    七月三十日解放军报社论
    中国人民解放军在中国革命的狂风暴雨中，经历了伟大而光荣的三十年。
    我军三十年的斗争经验一再证明，我们之所以能够在极端困难的条件下，以劣势的装备战胜强大的国内外的敌人，最根本的原因，是由于中国共产党的正确领导。离开了党的正确领导，就不可能有中国革命的胜利，就不可能有我们这支武装部队的胜利。资产阶级右派分子叫嚣什么“取消”党对军队的领导，无非是暴露了他们妄图反对我国社会主义和恢复资本主义的阴谋诡计而已。
    我们知道：远在第一次国内革命战争时，我们党就开始参加和领导了武装斗争。当时党处于幼年时期，经验还不足。正当革命的紧急关头，由于陈独秀右倾机会主义在党内占了统治地位，蒋介石国民党发动一个反革命政变，就把轰轰烈烈的大革命烈火扑灭下去了。后来，我们党迅速地纠正了这个错误路线，根据中国社会和中国革命发展的特点，确定了以武装斗争为中国革命的主要形式的正确路线，制定了首先实行农村割据，以农村包围城市，然后夺取城市的方针。根据这个方针路线，党在大革命失败以后立即在南方数省组织了武装起义，创建了中国工农红军，建立了革命根据地和革命政权，并且制定了一套适合中国情况的战略战术和政治工作制度。当时条件虽然极为艰苦，敌人的进攻异常频繁，但是我们仍然坚持下来了，接连打垮了敌人的军事进攻，发展和壮大了革命力量。可是正当革命向前发展的时候，党内被以王明、博古为首的
  “左”倾机会主义所统治，他们实行的错误路线使得革命根据地和红军的力量遭到严重的损失，直到党中央在长征途中召开的遵义会议上，才坚决批判和纠正了这种“左”倾机会主义路线，确立了毛泽东同志在中央的领导地位。从此以后，我们党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央领导之下，执行了正确的政治路线和军事路线，所以中国革命和中国人民武装力量就得到了长足的发展和伟大的胜利。经过八年的抗日战争和四年的解放战争，党领导和团结全国人民，运用这支人民武装力量，最后战胜了侵入我国的日本帝国主义，战胜了八百万国民党反革命军队，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，完成了民族民主革命的伟大历史任务。在这个革命胜利的基础上，党又领导全国人民用和平的方法进行了社会主义革命，并且动员和组织全国人民的力量，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    在全国革命胜利以后，党领导着我军执行保卫祖国社会主义建设、反对帝国主义侵略、积极准备解放台湾的光荣任务。为了有效地执行这个任务，我军根据党中央和毛主席的指示，并结合苏联军队建设的经验，进行了现代化正规化的建设工作。经过几年的正规建设和正规训练，我军官兵的军事技术、政治觉悟和科学文化水平都有了显著的提高，部队的组织性和纪律性也大大增强了。特别是中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战争中所取得的辉煌胜利，更是大为丰富了我军战胜现代化技术装备的帝国主义军队的作战经验。现在，我军不但有强大的陆军，而且有坚强的空军和海军。此外，由于我军在近几年来积极参加和支援了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作，在我军内部又进行了几次政治思想改造运动，这样就使得我军在政治上思想上得到很大的锻炼和提高，各种非无产阶级思想意识受到不断的批判和纠正。这一切都充分地说明：我军在战胜国外强大的敌人和保卫祖国社会主义建设的事业中能够取得如此巨大的胜利和成就，是和党的正确领导完全分不开的。右派分子妄图“削弱”和“取消”党对军队的领导的阴谋，已经被我军三十年的历史事实击得粉碎！
    目前我们国家正处在一个伟大的历史时期，为了执行党和国家交给我们的保卫祖国和防御帝国主义的任务，我们除了继续进行现代化建设以外，更重要的是，对全军广大官兵进行深入的社会主义教育，坚定每个军人为社会主义和共产主义事业服务的坚强信念，纠正各种非无产阶级思想，特别是资产阶级思想。我国社会主义革命是在短短的几年时间内完成的，而且是采用的和平改造方法。我国的经济基础虽然迅速地改变了，但是人们的思想意识还没有完全随之改变。目前的反右派斗争正是在政治上思想上的一次伟大的社会主义革命，也是在政治上、思想上一场尖锐的阶级斗争。因此，必须对全军人员进行系统的社会主义教育和思想改造工作，使他们在社会变革的大风浪中能够站稳立场，明辨是非，坚定地为共产主义事业而奋斗。
    为了加强社会主义教育，必须更好地组织干部的马克思列宁主义理论的学习。这种学习必须和中国革命和建设的实际情况结合起来，必须努力学习党的政策决议和毛主席的著作。反对那种只把马克思列宁主义经典著作才算理论，而把党的政策决议和毛主席的著作当作“时事政策”的错误作法。我们应当把这两者结合起来学习。因为党的政策决议和毛主席的著作都是根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范，所以我们应该认真地学习。
    我们必须看到：社会主义革命是要涉及到全国人民的思想和生活的。由于阶级立场和政治觉悟的不同，党的各种政策也常常在每个人的脑子里起着不同的反应。我国社会主义革命不仅要消灭阶级，消灭剥削制度，这一点我们已经基本上做到了；而且还要在政治上、思想上取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利，否则，社会主义的胜利就没有希望。可是这种政治上思想上的社会主义革命，在某种程度上说来，是比推翻剥削阶级的反动统治更加复杂、更加艰巨的任务。因此，每个革命军人不仅要经得起战争的考验，而且还要经得起社会主义革命的考验。在这个革命斗争中，我们应当坚定地站在无产阶级社会主义的立场，忠实地执行党的政策决议。目前，部队中存在的对于统购统销、农业合作化、工农生活水平和肃反等等问题的一些错误观点和糊涂思想，干部思想上的个人主义、自由主义和无政府主义、平均主义，以及工作作风上的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，都应当进行严肃的批判和纠正。应当明确认识：提高干部的马克思列宁主义水平，是我军当前重要的任务。只有干部的马克思列宁主义水平提高了，我们的工作才会做得真正有成效。
    为了加强全军的社会主义教育，必须在部队中，首先是在党内造成一种批评和自我批评的风气，反对那种只愿听到表扬，不愿听到批评，特别是不愿听到来自下级和士兵的批评的现象。批评和自我批评是推动我们政治上思想上前进的重要动力。人们要天天洗脸，才能保持清洁卫生；武器要经常擦拭，才能保持战斗准备；我们要经常进行批评和自我批评，才能及时地纠正错误。我们的批评是从团结的愿望出发的，是为了帮助同志进步而不是恶意的攻击；是为了巩固我们的纪律而不是削弱纪律，是为了增强我军的团结而不是妨碍团结。右派分子妄图利用“批评”这个武器来向我们进攻，目的是为了削弱我们党的领导和军队的纪律，破坏我们的团结。对这种所谓“批评”，我们必须坚决加以反击。而对于一切善意的批评，凡是正确的、合理的部分，都应该接受，并且根据这些意见来改正我们思想上工作上的错误；对错误的批评，不合理的意见，或者意见是合理的、但是暂时做不到的，我们也应该进行耐心的解释。
    我军三十年的历史已经充分地证明：党的正确领导是我军胜利的决定因素。今后，我军所担负的任务仍然是繁重的，艰巨的。因此，必须继续加强党的领导，加强全军官兵的社会主义教育，使我军政治上思想上更加坚强和团结，军队内部、军队与人民和政府之间的关系更加密切无间，全军学习现代化军事科学技术的积极性更高，从而使我们更有力量、更有信心地去完成党和国家交给我们的光荣的历史任务。
