I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo, as well as the reports of Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

In the government's reports, a concise account and appropriate assessment are made of the achievements of our socialist transformation and socialist construction. This is absolutely necessary. These achievements are the result of the arduous struggle and diligent labor of the people of the whole country, especially the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals. They are also the foundation for our continued progress and must not be obliterated.

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for rectification, the bourgeois rightists, under the pretext of helping the Communist Party rectify its work, launched a frenzied attack on the working class according to their long-planned conspiracy. This attack is essentially a restoration movement by a section of the bourgeoisie and their intellectuals who resist socialist transformation. As a trade union worker, I would like to express some opinions on this issue.

Exposing the Bourgeois Rightists' Conspiracy for Restoration

In this restoration movement, the bourgeois rightists adopted the trick of "stealing the sky and changing the sun": they closed their eyes and completely negated the great victories already achieved by the working people; they exaggerated the shortcomings and errors in our work to the fullest extent. They vainly attempted, through a series of smears, to depict the new China under the leadership of the working class as a dark and dismal world. In their pens and mouths, this world is simply so dark that it is worse than the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and not even as good as the Northern Warlords.

Since the bourgeois rightists have the ability to "expose" the darkness, they naturally also have the ability to "point out" the causes of the darkness. What are these causes? In the minds of the bourgeois rightists, the first is the leadership of the Communist Party, and the second is the socialist system. In fact, this is the same thing.

The bourgeois rightists label everything they dislike as dogmatism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and collectively call them the "three evils." The Communist Party is the embodiment of the "three evils," and the socialist system is the source of the "three evils." To put it mildly, "bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism"; in plain language, it is "kill you Communists," using their old tune, "the Communist Party is a flood and a beast," "killing and arson." As for the Communist Party "sharing wives" and the like, they cannot say it now, but it is said that the Communist Party has become "monks" again.

According to the bourgeois rightists, what should be the logical conclusion? Naturally, the Communist Party should step down and they should step up; socialism should be finished, and capitalism should be restored. This is truly a satisfying "political design." However, the bourgeois right-wingers may feel very regretful, they have overestimated their "construction" strength. The hammer is in the hands of the working class.

For this set of "designs" of the bourgeois rightists, I think it is enough to expose them. It is necessary to savor the "sweet words" and hypocritical faces of the rightists.

A Cleverly Disguised Wolf Cannot Hide Its Tail

Some people say that after the Five-Anti Campaign and the full-industry public-private partnership, the bourgeoisie has no more dual character. Whoever says there is still a dual character is a dogmatist. Well, let us examine it realistically.

How were the bourgeoisie's means of production handed over? First, the general trend was irreversible, and the people's hearts were with it. Forced by the situation, if they did not hand it over, the employees would not agree, and there was no economic way out; second, after handing it over, they could still get fixed interest at a rate of five percent for a certain period, and they could also get arranged in work and life, so handing it over was also barely acceptable. Is it willing to hand it over? Not willing. The masses of workers across the country do not believe that the bourgeoisie handed over the means of production entirely voluntarily, nor do they believe that all bourgeois elements no longer miss the capitalist life. When it is possible to restore capitalism, some capitalists still want to restore it. We have always been sincere, this is the truth. However, it is not the entire bourgeoisie who are really making trouble for restoration, but only the bourgeois rightists.

The bourgeois rightists say on the one hand that the bourgeoisie has no more dual character, only one character; on the other hand, they are engaged in a restoration movement. What kind of one-sidedness is this?

The bourgeois rightists say that the bourgeoisie has no dual character, deliberately blurring class boundaries. If you don't believe it, look, they say that "the bourgeoisie and the working class are essentially different, but the members of these two classes have no essential difference." But where is the forest if you leave the trees? So the conclusion is naturally that "the characteristics of all classes in our country have been basically eliminated." In this way, the class boundaries are gone, and the two nouns of the bourgeoisie and the working class are also superfluous. Where is the leadership of the working class? This is a conspiracy, this is to negate the leadership of the working class, to make the working class lose vigilance in the class struggle, without precaution, so that their restoration conspiracy can win effortlessly. Wolves are dangerous, and wolves disguised as grandmothers are even more dangerous. But no matter how cleverly the wolf is disguised, the tail still has no suitable place to put it.

If it is said that the bourgeoisie has no dual character, then is fixed interest still needed? When it comes to profit, it cannot be abandoned, and the more the better. Seven years of fixed interest is too little, it should be twenty years. Twenty years is not enough to quench the thirst, simply drive the public representatives out of the enterprise, and turn the public-private partnership into "joint public-private." Even such arrogant clamoring is not called a restoration movement, but helping the Party to rectify its work. Why? The bourgeois right-wing theorists say that fixed interest is not exploitation, but just "gaining without labor." Is this fixed interest, which has not been obtained through one's own labor, a gift from God? Although the bourgeoisie has not worked, the working class has worked. To be precise, the fixed interest taken by the bourgeoisie is a part of the labor results of the working class. What is this if not exploitation? Since you want to exploit, why be shy! It is said that if fixed interest is said to be exploitation, industrialists and businessmen cannot be calm and will be angry. Well, if this is the case, let them be angry!

The bourgeois rightists said: "According to the literal meaning of exploitation, the exploited should be very painful, but we also say that the current contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is not antagonistic, which does not make sense." Yes, being exploited is painful, so the working class is determined to take the socialist road and is determined to eliminate all exploiting classes, including the bourgeoisie. Then why is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie regarded as a contradiction among the people? It is clear that this is not to thank the bourgeoisie for its exploitation, but because the bourgeoisie is willing to accept transformation. If the bourgeoisie does not accept transformation and wants to rebel, then the contradiction will immediately become antagonistic. Moreover, we should also point out that even in the case where the bourgeoisie accepts transformation, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie is, after all, different from the contradictions within the working people. Chairman Mao said: "The contradictions within the people, between the working people, are non-antagonistic; between the exploited class and the exploiting class, in addition to the antagonistic side, there is also a non-antagonistic side." I think it can also be said in reverse, that is: in addition to the non-antagonistic side, there is also an antagonistic side.

The bourgeoisie in our country is transforming in the direction of its own opposition. This is a fact, but this process will still be long-term. After the economic transformation is completed, the ideological transformation will take even longer. After the economic transformation is completed, there will still be some people who are unwilling to eliminate their class and miss their past era, that is to say, there will still be class struggle on the ideological front. The elimination process of the bourgeoisie is a process of struggle, which requires self-transformation of the bourgeois elements, as well as the help of the working class.

Welcome Industrialists and Businessmen Who Continue to Show Enthusiasm

Resolutely Repulse the Bourgeoisie's Restoration Movement

We trade union workers never hide the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, we advocate drawing a clear line. At the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held at the end of January and the beginning of February in 1956, I once said this: "We do not hide, nor should we hide, that there is a boundary between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and this boundary should be clearly distinguished and not blurred. But the purpose of drawing a clear line is to help capitalists carry out socialist transformation of their enterprises and themselves, and finally completely eliminate this boundary, so the workers across the country are now very excitedly watching this situation, that is: under the education of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese bourgeoisie is transforming itself."

Yes, at the beginning of last year, industrialists and businessmen across the country once showed enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation. The broad masses of workers across the country did not care about past grievances and gave a warm welcome to this performance of the industrialists and businessmen, treating them as friends, agreeing to give them necessary care in work and life, and supporting the measures to extend the fixed interest period to the second five-year plan period. The reason why the workers did so was to exchange the bourgeoisie's sympathy for socialism, to achieve socialist transformation more smoothly, and to carry out socialist construction more smoothly. It is true that the majority of the bourgeoisie accepted this kindness and continued to show their enthusiasm in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. However, the bourgeois rightists are full of hatred, they believe that handing over enterprises and implementing communism is "national subjugation," "they are not willing to succumb to national subjugation and communism." We welcome industrialists and businessmen who continue to show enthusiasm in socialist transformation at any time, but we must resolutely repel the bourgeois rightists and the bourgeois restoration movement.

We do not hide the class boundaries in order to effectively help capitalists carry out self-transformation, so as to facilitate true unity—unity under the banner of socialism. The rightists blur the class boundaries in order to facilitate their restoration conspiracy. Without exposing the hypocrisy of the rightists, we cannot enhance the unity of the working class and the bourgeoisie under the banner of socialism, which is also detrimental to the vast number of industrialists and businessmen who are willing to take the socialist road.

The above is what I want to say about the bourgeois rightists' frenzied attack on the working class, that is, the restoration movement launched by the bourgeoisie. Below, I would like to say something about our views on the rectification movement.

The Starting Point of the National Workers and Masses' Wholehearted Support for the Party's Rectification Movement Is Fundamentally Opposite to That of the Bourgeois Rightists

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the achievements that the people of the whole country have made are extremely great. Great achievements will not disappear due to hateful slander and curses. They are objective existences, and their existence itself is enough to shatter hateful insults and curses. However, we are not ignoring the shortcomings and errors in our work. Indeed, in our work, there are many shortcomings and errors, and some shortcomings and errors are even serious. These shortcomings and errors must be overcome and corrected. The Central Committee of the Communist Party has repeatedly stated that it welcomes all well-intentioned criticisms, even those that are not completely correct. This attitude is sincere and open. The workers across the country wholeheartedly support this attitude, and truly help the Party. Have the broad masses of workers not also made many criticisms of the Party and the government? Do the workers also oppose subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism? However, all of this is to strengthen the leadership of the Party, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, to enhance the unity of the people of the whole country, and to improve work in all aspects. In short, for the cause of socialism. This is our fundamentally opposite starting point from the bourgeois rightists.

Our views on shortcomings and errors are also fundamentally different from those of the bourgeois rightists. We believe that some shortcomings and errors are caused by lack of experience or brought about by new conditions. This is of course unavoidable. Because the accumulation of experience takes time, and new conditions cannot be fully foreseen. Some shortcomings and errors are caused by subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism. Where do these three isms come from? Its root is not the socialist system, but the influence of bourgeois ideology. So the rectification cannot be to shake the socialist system, but to rectify the influence of bourgeois ideology.

Bourgeois ideology also has a certain influence in our working class's mass ranks. We have never believed that our working class is completely without shortcomings. However, this is definitely different from the dual character of the bourgeoisie, as the bourgeois rightists say. We have no feelings for the external influence of bourgeois ideology, and we are working hard to eliminate it. Not only is our Party carrying out rectification, but our mass ranks are also tirelessly carrying out self-education. At present, we especially need to educate ourselves in repelling the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois rightists.

How to carry out rectification and self-education? The basic issue lies in implementing the Party's mass line and in correctly promoting democracy. As far as factories and enterprises are concerned, as mentioned in Premier Zhou Enlai's report, it is to promote the system of employee representative conferences. The employee representative conference is a powerful supervisory body and a relatively good form of employee participation in enterprise management. The establishment and improvement of the employee representative conference will greatly help to overcome the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism of enterprise leaders, and will also greatly help the self-education of the working class masses.

On the basis of the continuous improvement of the working class's awareness and organizational level, and on the basis of defeating the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois rightists, the increase production and practice economy movement and the advanced producers movement will inevitably be carried out more deeply, and the cause of socialist construction will inevitably achieve greater achievements.

The working class and the people of the whole country are of one mind with the Communist Party. The socialist cause must be victorious, and capitalism must not be revived, or it must die completely. This is the inevitable trend of history.

### 资本主义一定要彻底死亡  赖若愚的发言

    资本主义一定要彻底死亡
    赖若愚的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理和薄一波副总理的报告以及张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。
    在政府所提出的几个报告中，对于我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的成就做了扼要的叙述和恰当的估计，这是完全必要的。这些成就，是全国人民，首先是工人、农民和革命知识分子艰苦斗争和辛勤劳动的结果，也是我们继续前进的基础，是决不容许抹煞的。
    自从中共中央发出了整风号召以后，资产阶级右派就借口帮助共产党整风，按照他们蓄意已久的阴谋，发动了对工人阶级的猖狂进攻。这一种进攻实质上是一部分抗拒社会主义改造的资产阶级和他们的知识分子的复辟运动。作为一个工会工作者，我想就这个问题发表一些意见。
    戳穿资产阶级右派的复辟阴谋
    在这次复辟运动中，资产阶级右派采取了“偷天换日”的手法：他们把劳动人民已经取得的伟大胜利，闭起眼睛来一笔抹煞；他们把工作中的缺点和错误，尽情地加以夸大。他们妄想经过一番涂抹，把工人阶级领导下的新中国描绘成一个暗无天日的黑暗世界。在他们的笔底下和嘴巴里，这个世界简直黑暗得很，比国民党反动统治时期坏，比北洋军阀也不如。
    资产阶级右派既然有本领“揭露”黑暗，当然也有本领“指出”造成黑暗的原因。这些原因是什么呢？在资产阶级右派的心目中，第一是共产党的领导，第二是社会主义制度。其实这是一回事。
    资产阶级右派把他们所不喜欢的一切都指为教条主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，而且统名之曰“三害”。共产党是“三害”的化身，社会主义制度是“三害”的根源。用隐晦一点的话说，“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”；用明朗的语言“杀你们共产党人”，用他们的老调子说话，“共产党是洪水猛兽”“杀人放火”。至于共产党“共妻”之类的话，他们现在是无法出口了，不过据说共产党又变成“和尚”了。
    按照资产阶级右派的说法，逻辑的结论该是什么呢？很自然，共产党下台，他们上台；社会主义完蛋，资本主义复辟。这真是一个称心如意的“政治设计”。不过资产阶级右派分子也许会感到很遗憾，他们对自己的“施工”力量估计过高了。铁锤是在工人阶级手上。
    对于资产阶级右派的这一套“设计”，我想只要戳穿就够了。对于右派分子的“甜言蜜语”、伪善面孔，倒有必要玩味一下。
    装扮巧妙的狼无法掩盖它的尾巴
    有人说，经过五反和全行业公私合营，工商业者交出生产资料以后，资产阶级已经没有两面性了。谁说还有两面性谁就是教条主义。好吧，让我们实事求是地考察一下。
    资产阶级的生产资料是怎样交出来的呢？第一是大势所趋，人心所向，迫于情势，不交出来，职工群众不会答应，而且经济上也没有出路；第二交出来以后还可以在一定时期内拿到五厘定息，工作上、生活上还可以得到安排，交出来也还勉强可以。试问交出来甘心不甘心呢？不甘心。全国职工群众并不认为资产阶级交出生产资料是完全出于自愿的，也并不认为所有资产阶级分子已经不再留恋资本主义生活了。有可能复辟的时候，总有些资本家还是想复辟的。我们从来是心口如一的，这是老实话。不过真正闹复辟的不是资产阶级全体，只是资产阶级右派。
    资产阶级右派一方面说资产阶级没有两面性了，只有一面性了；一方面却在闹复辟运动，这是什么样的一面性呢？
    资产阶级右派说资产阶级没有两面性，是有意要模糊阶级界限。不信你看，他们说“资产阶级与工人阶级有本质的不同，但这两个阶级的分子没有本质的区别”。可是离开了树木那里还是森林呢？所以结论自然是“目前我国所有阶级的特性已基本上消灭”。这样，阶级界限没有了，资产阶级和工人阶级这两个名词也是多余的了，哪里还有什么工人阶级的领导呢？这是阴谋，这是要否定工人阶级的领导，是要工人阶级在阶级斗争中丧失警惕，不加提防，好让他们的复辟阴谋不费气力地取得胜利。狼是危险的，装做外婆的狼就更危险。不过不管狼怎样装扮得巧妙，尾巴总还是没有适当的地方安置。
    如果说资产阶级没有两面性了，那么定息还要不要呢？说到利，那可不能放弃，而且越多越好，定息七年太少了，要来二十年。二十年还不解渴，干脆把公方代表赶出企业，把公私合营变成“合公营私”。就连这样狂妄的叫嚣也不叫复辟运动，而是帮助党整风哩。为什么呢？资产阶级右派理论家说定息不是剥削，只是“不劳而获”。难道这个没有经过自己的劳动而获得的定息是上帝的赐与吗？资产阶级虽然没有劳动过，工人阶级可是劳动过的。说确切一点，资产阶级所拿的定息是工人阶级劳动成果的一部分。这不是剥削是什么？既然要剥削，何必还怕羞呢！据说如果把定息说成剥削，工商业家不能心平气和，就要发脾气了。好吧，如果真是这样，那就让他们发脾气吧！
    资产阶级右派说：“照剥削字面讲，被剥削者应该是很痛苦的，但我们又说资产阶级和工人阶级当前的矛盾，并不具有对抗性，这就说不通了。”是的，被剥削是痛苦的，所以工人阶级才坚决要走社会主义的道路，才坚决要消灭一切剥削阶级，包括资产阶级在内。那为什么又把工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾当作人民内部矛盾来看待呢？很明白，这并不是为了感谢资产阶级的剥削，而是因为资产阶级愿意接受改造。如果资产阶级不接受改造，要造反，那么矛盾就马上变成对抗性的。并且，我们还应当指出，就是在资产阶级接受改造的情况下，工人阶级和资产阶级之间的矛盾，也毕竟不同于劳动人民内部的矛盾。毛主席说：“人民内部的矛盾，在劳动人民之间说来，是非对抗性的；在被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间说来，除了对抗性的一面以外，还有非对抗性的一面”。我想反过来说也可以，即：除了非对抗性的一面以外，还有对抗性的一面。
    我国的资产阶级正在向着它自己的反对方向转化着，这是事实，不过这个过程还将是长期的。在经济上的改造完成之后，思想上的改造还需要更长的时间。经济上的改造完成之后，还会有一部分人不甘心本阶级的消灭，怀念着他们已经过去的时代，那就是说在思想战线上还有阶级斗争。资产阶级的消灭过程，是一个斗争的过程，这中间需要资产阶级分子的自我改造，也需要工人阶级的帮助。
    欢迎继续表现积极的工商业者
    坚决回击资产阶级的复辟运动
    我们工会工作者从来不隐讳工人阶级和资产阶级之间的界限，我们主张划清这个界限。在一九五六年一月底二月初举行的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上，我曾经说过这样的话：“我们毫不隐讳，也不应当隐讳，工人阶级和资产阶级之间是有一条界限的，而且这个界限是应当分清楚而不应当模糊的。但是划清界限的目的是为了帮助资本家对他们的企业和他们本人进行社会主义改造，最后完全消灭这种界限，所以全国职工现在十分兴奋地注视着这种情况，即：在中国共产党和毛主席的教育下，中国资产阶级在改造着自己”。
    是的，去年年初，全国各地工商业者，曾经表现了接受社会主义改造的积极性。全国广大职工群众毫不计较过去的嫌隙，对于工商业者的这种表现给予了热情的欢迎，把他们当做朋友，同意在工作上和生活上给予他们必要的照顾，拥护把定息年限延长到第二个五年计划期间的措施。职工群众所以如此，是为了换取资产阶级对于社会主义的同情，是为了更顺利地实现社会主义改造，更顺利地进行社会主义建设。不错，资产阶级的大多数接受了这种好意，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中继续表现了他们的积极性。可是资产阶级右派却怀着满腔的仇恨，他们认为交出企业，实行共产，就是“亡国”，“他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的”。我们对于在社会主义改造中继续表现积极的工商业者，无论什么时候都是欢迎的，可是对于资产阶级右派，对于资产阶级的复辟运动，就一定要予以坚决的回击。
    我们不隐讳阶级界限，是为了有效地帮助资本家进行自我改造，以利于真正的团结——在社会主义旗帜下的团结。右派分子模糊阶级界限，是为了有利于他们的复辟阴谋。不戳穿右派分子的伪善，就不能增进工人阶级和资产阶级在社会主义旗帜下的团结，这对于愿意走社会主义道路的广大工商业者，也是不利的。
    以上是对于资产阶级右派向工人阶级的猖狂进攻，亦即对于资产阶级所发动的复辟运动所要说的话。以下，我想说一下我们对于整风运动的看法。
    全国职工群众竭诚拥护党的整风运动出发点是与资产阶级右派根本相反
    解放以来，在共产党的领导之下，全国人民已经取得的成就是极其伟大的。伟大的成就不会由于可恶的诬蔑和诅咒就消失，它是客观的存在，它的存在本身就足以粉碎可恶的侮蔑和诅咒。然而我们也并不是无视于工作中的缺点和错误。确实，在我们的工作中，存在着许多缺点和错误，有些缺点和错误甚至是严重的。这些缺点、错误必须加以克服和纠正。中共中央一再表示对于一切善意的批评，那怕是不完全正确的批评都是欢迎的。这种态度是真诚的，是光明磊落的。对于这种态度，全国职工群众是竭诚拥护的，而且对党是真正帮助的。广大的职工群众不也对党和政府提出了很多批评吗？职工群众不也反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义吗？然而这一切都是为了加强党的领导，为了巩固人民民主专政，为增进全国人民的团结，为了改进各方面的工作。总之，为了社会主义事业。这就是我们与资产阶级右派根本相反的出发点。
    对于缺点和错误的看法，我们也是和资产阶级右派根本不同的，我们认为：有些缺点和错误，是由于缺乏经验产生的，或者是新的条件带来的。这当然是不能完全避免的。因为经验的积累需要时间，新的条件也不是可以完全预见的。有些缺点和错误，则是由于主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义产生的。这三个主义从哪里来的呢？它的根源不是社会主义制度，而是资产阶级思想影响。所以整风不能是动摇社会主义制度，而是整掉资产阶级思想影响。
    资产阶级思想在我们工人阶级的群众队伍中也有一定的影响。我们从来也没有认为我们工人阶级是完全没有缺点的，然而这决不同于资产阶级的两面性，如资产阶级右派分子所说的那样。我们对于外来的资产阶级思想影响毫无感情，我们在努力清除它。不只是我们的党在进行整风，我们的群众队伍也在不懈怠地进行着自我教育。在目前，我们尤其要在反击资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻中教育自己。
    如何进行整风和自我教育呢？基本问题在于贯彻党的群众路线，在于正确地发扬民主。就工厂企业来说，正如周恩来总理报告中所提到的，就是推行职工代表大会制度。职工代表大会是一个有权力的监督机构，是职工群众参加企业管理的一种比较好的形式，职工代表大会的建立与健全，将大有助于克服企业领导人员的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，也将大有助于工人阶级群众队伍的自我教育。
    在工人阶级的觉悟程度和组织程度不断提高的基础上，在战胜资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的基础上，增产节约运动和先进生产者运动必将更深入地开展起来，社会主义建设事业必将取得更伟大的成就。
    工人阶级和全国人民，与共产党是一条心，社会主义事业一定要胜利，资本主义一定不能复活，或者说一定要彻底死亡，这是历史的必然。
