I have listened to Premier Zhou's government work report and the speeches of many comrades. I am thinking about the earth-shaking great cause made by China's 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. After completing the democratic revolution, we have basically completed the socialist revolution. The cause of socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. The first five-year plan will be overfulfilled this year, and people's lives have been greatly improved compared to before. I am very happy and will see a prosperous, strong, and beautiful socialist society realized in our lovely motherland. Some people say that the Communist Party is fond of boasting and eager for success. I say yes. What the Communist Party "likes" is the "greatness" of 600 million people, and what it "rejoices" in is the "success" of socialism. Only Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can lead the great country of 600 million people to build the great achievement of socialism. Therefore, I will sincerely support the Communist Party's "fondness of greatness and eagerness for success."

Of course, leading 600 million people in the great cause of socialism cannot be said to be without difficulties and shortcomings. In the eight years since the founding of the country, we have indeed encountered many difficulties, and our work has also had some shortcomings and errors. However, the Communist Party is not afraid of difficulties, is capable of overcoming all difficulties, and has never concealed its shortcomings and errors. In April this year, the CPC Central Committee announced a rectification campaign within the Party and encouraged extensive airing of views, welcoming criticisms and suggestions from people outside the Party. I am deeply moved by the great spirit of the Chinese Communist Party. I believe that through this rectification campaign, errors and shortcomings in our work can be corrected, difficulties can be overcome, and the prospects for the victory of the socialist cause are more assured.

However, within the people, within the united front, there is still a small group of people who are not jubilant about the victory of the socialist cause. Some people come from the old society and have been deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, unwilling to accept socialist transformation. They do not welcome the new society and new things. Among them, there are even a very few careerists, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Shaohong, Long Yun, and Chen Mingshu, who not only resist transformation but even spread absurd remarks and engage in conspiracy activities, attempting to shake the socialist system, endanger the socialist cause, and seize the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party.

These people are all well-known to me. In the past, we were all responsible for the work of the democratic parties. Among them, Zhang Naiqi and I participated in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement very early on. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have long been jointly responsible with me for the work of the China Democratic League. In the past, I also discovered that their political stance was extremely unstable and their work style had many problems, but I always hoped that in the joint participation in revolutionary work, they would gradually progress, get closer to the Party, and accept transformation. Now I am very angry and heartbroken to discover their anti-communist and anti-socialist evil deeds, and I realize that over these many years, they have not only not progressed, not accepted transformation, but have even degenerated to the edge of the enemy-us boundary.

The Party and the government have always been uniting, educating, and trusting Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and other rightists. They all participated in the important work of the People's Government, had high political status, and assumed important responsibilities in the democratic parties. The Party and the government hoped that they would participate in the socialist cause, serve the people wholeheartedly, and carry out self-education and self-transformation in their work. But on the contrary, they used their political status, work organs, and party organizations to develop their extreme individualistic ambitions, even engaging in conspiracy activities, slandering and vilifying the leaders of the Party and the government, sowing discord between the Party and the people, and undermining the socialist system. They first usurped the leadership of the democratic parties, and then used their legal status to carry out illegal anti-communist and anti-socialist activities, attempting to undermine the people's democratic dictatorship and seize the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party in order to realize the restoration of capitalism. Now the workers, peasants, and patriotic intellectuals of the whole country are filled with righteous indignation, criticizing and counterattacking the bourgeois rightists. Our China Democratic League and other democratic parties have passed resolutions to resolutely fight against the rightists and to carry out rectification within the democratic parties. This is absolutely necessary. We must never allow the socialist cause to be harmed or the socialist system to be shaken.

I completely agree with what Premier Zhou said in the government work report: the rightists only have two paths: "To repent sincerely and accept transformation. The door of socialist transformation is open to them." Otherwise, "if they resist transformation and even take actions to sabotage socialist construction, then they will isolate themselves from the people."

I hope that the members of our China Democratic League and the intellectuals associated with them will first seriously draw a clear political and ideological line with the bourgeois rightists, firmly stand on their socialist position, bravely plunge into the fierce struggle against the rightists, overcome sentimentalism, and carry the battle through to the end.

We intellectuals from the old society can only test ourselves, temper ourselves, overcome individualism, gradually establish the ideology of the working class, and undergo a complete transformation to pass the socialist test, sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, integrate with the workers and peasants, and happily work together to build a prosperous and strong socialist motherland in this fierce political and ideological battle.

### 克服温情主义　勇敢地投入反右派斗争  沈钧儒的发言

    克服温情主义　勇敢地投入反右派斗争
    沈钧儒的发言
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告和许多同志的发言，我想到中国六亿人民在中国共产党领导下作出的翻天复地的伟大事业。我们在完成了民主革命之后，基本上完成了社会主义革命，社会主义建设事业正在突飞猛进，第一个五年计划将在今年内超额完成，人民生活比以前大大改善了。我十分高兴，就会看到一个繁荣、富强、美丽的社会主义社会，在可爱的祖国实现。有人说：共产党是好大喜功的。我说是的。共产党“好”的是六万万人的“大”，“喜”的是社会主义的“功”，只有毛主席和共产党才能领导六万万人民的大国，建立社会主义的大功，因此，我就要竭诚拥护共产党的这样的“好大喜功”。
    当然领导着六万万人民干社会主义的伟大事业，不能说是没有困难和缺点的。建国八年以来，我们的确遇到了很多困难，我们的工作也有一些缺点和错误，但是共产党是不怕困难的，是能够克服一切困难的，共产党也从来不掩盖自己的缺点和错误。今年四月中共中央宣布党内整风，并且鼓励大鸣大放，欢迎党外人士的批评和建议。中国共产党这种伟大精神我是深受感动的。我相信经过这次整风，工作中的错误缺点可以改正，困难可以克服，社会主义事业的胜利前途是更有把握了。
    但是在人民内部，在统一战线中间，还有一小撮人，对于社会主义事业的胜利，并不是欢欣鼓舞的。有些人出身旧社会，受了资产阶级的深厚影响，不愿接受社会主义改造，他们对于新社会、新事物是不欢迎的。其中更有极少数野心家，像章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑、龙云、陈铭枢等人，不但抗拒改造，甚至散播荒谬言论，阴谋活动，企图动摇社会主义制度、危害社会主义事业，夺取工人阶级共产党的领导权。
    这些人都是我所熟识的，过去我们都负责民主党派的工作。其中章乃器是和我很早就在一起参加抗日救亡运动的。章伯钧和罗隆基长时期以来和我共同负责民盟的工作。过去我也曾发现他们政治立场极不坚定，工作作风很多毛病，但我总希望在共同参加革命工作中，他们会逐渐进步，靠拢党，接受改造。现在我很气愤、很痛心，发现了他们的反共反社会主义的罪恶行为，才知道这多少年来，他们不但没有进步，不接受改造，而且已经蜕化到敌我界线边沿上去了。
    党和政府对章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器以及其他右派分子，一直是在团结他们，教育他们，信任他们的。他们都参加了人民政府的重要工作，有很高的政治地位，并且负起了民主党派的重要责任。党和政府指望着他们参加社会主义事业，全心全意为人民服务，在工作中进行自我教育，自我改造。但是恰恰相反，他们利用了自己的政治地位，工作机关和党派组织，来发挥他们的极端个人主义的野心，甚至于进行阴谋活动，诋毁诬蔑党和政府的领导人，挑拨党和人民之间的团结，破坏社会主义制度。他们首先篡夺了民主党派的领导权，然后利用合法地位，进行反共反社会主义的非法活动，企图破坏人民民主专政，夺取工人阶级共产党的领导权，以实现资本主义的复辟。现在全国的工人、农民和爱国的知识分子义愤填膺，向资产阶级右派进行批判和反击。我们民盟和各民主党派已经通过决议，向右派分子进行坚决的斗争，并且在民主党派内部进行整风。这是完全必要的。我们决不能让社会主义事业受到损害，社会主义制度受到动摇。
    我完全同意周总理在政府工作报告中所说，右派分子的路只有两条：“憣然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的”。要不然“抗拒改造，甚至采取破坏社会主义建设的行动，那么，他们就将自绝于人民”。
    我希望我们民主同盟的成员和它们所联系的知识分子，首先同资产阶级右派分子认真划清政治和思想界线，站稳自己的社会主义立场，勇敢地投入反对右派的火热斗争当中，克服温情主义，把战斗进行到底。
    我们旧社会出身的知识分子，只有在这一场激烈的政治、思想战斗中考验自己，锻炼自己，克服个人主义，逐步树立工人阶级思想，脱胎换骨地度过社会主义这一关，真心诚意接受共产党的领导，同工人、农民打成一片，愉快地共同为建设繁荣富强的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
