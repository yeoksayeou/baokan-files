    Seafarers' Cultural Boat on the Pearl River
    In order to enrich the cultural and recreational life of seafarers and workers, the Pearl River Shipping Trade Union recently converted a "Flower-tail Ferry" into a seafarers' cultural boat. It is the first vessel in China dedicated to cultural and recreational activities for seafarers. This cultural boat has three floors and can accommodate five hundred employees at the same time. The boat is equipped with a recreation room, a library and reading room, an auditorium, a music room, and an open-air tea house. The picture shows the beautiful exterior of the Pearl River Seafarers' Cultural Boat. In the upper left corner, seafarers are playing chess and cards in the recreation room.

    珠江上的海员文化船
    为了丰富海员职工的文娱生活，珠江航运工会最近把一条“花尾渡”改装成了海员文化船。它是我国第一艘专供海员进行文娱活动的船只。这艘文化船高三层，可以同时容纳五百名职工。船内设有文娱室、图书阅览室、礼堂、音乐室和露天茶座。图为漂亮的珠江海员文化船外貌。左上角是海员们正在文娱室下棋、打朴克。  王南摄（南方日报社稿）
