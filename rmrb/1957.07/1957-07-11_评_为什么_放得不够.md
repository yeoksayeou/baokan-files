Commenting on "Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?"
    Luó Sūn

    Opening the June 16th issue, No. 12, of "New Observer," the first article is titled "Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?" The title is very attractive, and after reading it, I can't help but have some thoughts.

    The author, Comrade Lǐ Jīn, because he was not satisfied that "New Observer" was "cautious" during the "airing" and "letting go," so he thought of going to the "Literary Gazette" editorial department to "learn" how they were "greatly airing and letting go" in order to improve "our publication" (referring to "New Observer").

    The article is divided into four paragraphs. The first paragraph is about how the author met Comrade Chén Cōng, a reporter from "Literary Gazette," as soon as he arrived at the Federation of Literary and Art Circles building. This is the author who published "Comrade Dīng Líng Talks About Going Deep into Life" in the seventh issue of "Literary Gazette." The article starts from here. Comrade Lǐ Jīn said: "I am interested in this article (referring to Chén Cōng's article), because this article has aroused some opinions among readers. Some people ask: Why must we talk about the old problem of going deep into life at this time? Why doesn't Comrade Dīng Líng talk about her feelings and opinions in connection with the current rectification campaign?"

    It turns out that Comrade Lǐ Jīn's interest in this article is not about the issue of going deep into life that Dīng Líng talked about, but because "readers have opinions," because Dīng Líng didn't talk about her feelings about the rectification campaign, but talked about "this old problem." In fact, it is not "interest" that arose, but "dissatisfaction." This time, meeting Chén Cōng, he "suddenly realized."

    What did Comrade Lǐ Jīn "suddenly realize"? He himself described it as: "The editorial board of 'Literary Gazette' invited Comrade Dīng Líng to talk about the issue of going deep into life in order to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the publication of 'Talks at the Yán'ān Forum on Literature and Art'; of course, Comrade Dīng Líng also talked about the current rectification campaign in addition to talking about 'going deep into life.' Lǐ Jīn said, 'However, Comrade Chén Cōng had to write the interview according to the theme prescribed by the editorial board when he was writing. In this way, the article completed the task of the editorial board, but it could not satisfy the expectations of the readers.'"

    But I, as a reader, am just the opposite. I think it is very timely for Comrade Dīng Líng to talk about the issue of going deep into life today, when commemorating the 15th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yán'ān Forum on Literature and Art," because this issue was not only very important fifteen years ago, but also very important today, fifteen years later, just when the rectification campaign is beginning. In "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao emphatically pointed out regarding the issue of the continued transformation of intellectuals: "It is hoped that the intellectuals in our country will continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist world outlook in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually integrate themselves with the workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone regress, because there is no way out in regression." For writers, going deep into life and integrating with the working people is always an important issue, always a fresh issue that will never be outdated, and it is very beneficial to often have people call it out in the ears of writers.

    At the same time, although what Comrade Dīng Líng talked about is an "old problem," it is very relevant to today's situation and today's needs. For example, she said: "A narrow circle of life and being far away from the masses is the main reason why some of our writers have not been able to write good works in recent years." Regarding the view that "after the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,' some people think that writers do not necessarily have to go deep into the lives and struggles of the masses, and some individual comrades even think that they can create by sitting in the study and relying solely on second-hand materials," she expressed doubt and said, "How can we people do it if we don't make up our minds to go to the masses?" I really don't see anything untimely about these statements, why did they arouse dissatisfaction among readers? Looking at the title "Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?", the author probably wants to talk about the obstacles to "letting go enough," that is, the so-called "feelings and opinions"? He did not find what he needed in this interview, and therefore could not be satisfied.

    This is the first example of "Why Isn't 'Letting Go' Enough?"

    There is also a second example. In the second paragraph of the article, he wrote: "I also met an editor of 'Literary Gazette,' according to whom many readers think that 'Literary Gazette' is like a bulletin board of the police station. What is the most important contradiction in the literary and art circles today? 'Literary Gazette' has not reflected it." What is the "most important contradiction"? He cited some reports and articles by Comrade Zhōu Yáng on literary and art issues over the past few years, saying, "How should we view these today? Many comrades in the literary and art circles have opinions on these reports and articles. Can we launch a 'contention'? Why is this kind of 'contention' so late in coming?" It turns out that it is because he has not seen the "Literary Gazette" publish criticisms of Comrade Zhōu Yáng's "reports and articles," so he believes that the "Literary Gazette" has not reflected the most important contradiction in the current literary and art circles. No one has ever said that Comrade Zhōu Yáng's articles cannot be criticized. Not long ago, there were criticisms in the Wénhuì Bào and the "Literary Gazette," and even earlier, there were criticisms at the symposium convened by the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association, which was published in the newspapers. This is a normal phenomenon. However, why have Comrade Zhōu Yáng's reports and articles become the "most important contradiction in the current literary and art circles"? When he heard that the editorial board of "Literary Gazette" decided to organize this type of discussion articles, he believed that "this is worthy of our study. The study and criticism of academic issues should not be based on the person but on the matter. There will be no one who is 'always correct.'"

    I think no one has opposed that "the study and criticism of academic issues should not be based on the person but on the matter." However, this precisely reveals that the author himself has a bit of a "looking at the person" flavor in his heart, so he says: Can we launch a "contention"? Why is it so late in coming? And then he says: There will be no one who is "always correct." Isn't that about to come out?

    Therefore, Comrade Lǐ Jīn believes that "letting go" is not enough, and we must "let go" greatly. To "let go" is to seize the "most important contradiction in the current literary and art circles," to seize "these reports and articles" to organize criticism, otherwise, it is "letting go" insufficiently.

    Of course, "contention and airing" can be carried out on anyone's reports and articles, especially academic issues, which need to be resolved through discussion, reasoning, and debate. But please say it directly, why bother going around in circles?

    The article is not over yet, there are third and fourth examples. I think I will not repeat them, and I would like to ask everyone to distinguish them for themselves.

    评“为什么‘放’得不够”
    罗荪
    打开6月16日出版的“新观察”第十二期，第一篇文章的题目是“为什么‘放’得不够”，题目很吸引人，我读了之后，也不免引起一点感想。
    作者李今同志因为不满意“新观察”在“鸣”、“放”中“还像是温和水”，所以就想到“文艺报”编辑部去“学习”一下他们是怎样“大鸣大放”的，以便改进“我们的刊物”（指“新观察”）。
    文章共分四段，第一段是作者一到文联大楼就遇见了“文艺报”的记者陈骢同志，就是在第七期“文艺报”上发表“丁玲同志谈深入生活”的作者。文章就从这里开始了。李今同志说：“这篇文章（指陈骢文）我是发生兴趣的，因为这篇文章在读者中引起了一些意见。有人问：为什么一定要在现在这个时候谈深入生活这个老问题？丁玲同志为什么不结合当前的整风谈谈她的感受和意见？”
    原来李今同志对这篇文章发生兴趣的，不是丁玲同志所说的深入生活的问题，而是“读者有意见”，是因为丁玲同志为什么不谈谈整风的感受，而谈“这个老问题”。实际上不是发生“兴趣”，而是发生了“不满”，这回遇见了陈骢，于是“恍然大悟”了。
    李今同志“恍然大悟”了什么呢？他自己叙述说：“文艺报”编委会为了纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十五周年请丁玲同志谈深入生活问题；当然，丁玲同志在谈了“深入生活”之外，也还谈到目前的整风，李今说“可是陈骢同志执笔的时候，却不得不按编委会规定的主题写访问记。这样，文章是完成了编委会的任务，但是，却满足不了读者的期望。”
  可是我这个读者却恰恰相反，我以为丁玲同志在纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十五周年的今天谈谈深入生活问题是非常及时的，因为这个问题不但在十五年前很重要，而且在十五年后的今天，正当整风开始的时候，也是非常重要的。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中，对于知识分子必须继续改造的问题，着重的指出：“希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”对于作家来讲，深入生活和劳动人民群众打成一片，永远是一个重要的问题，永远是不会过时的一个新鲜的问题，常常有人在作家们的耳边叫叫是有很大好处的。
    同时，丁玲同志谈的虽然是“老问题”，但和今天的形势，和今天的需要是很切合的。比如她说：“生活圈子狭小，远离群众，这是我们有些作家在近几年来写不出好作品的主要原因。”对于“当党中央提出了‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’的方针以后，听说有些人就认为作家不一定要深入到群众的生活和斗争中去了，甚至有个别的同志认为，坐在书斋里光凭第二手材料也可以进行创作”的看法表示怀疑，她说：“我们这些人，如果不下决心到群众中去，又怎么行呢？”我实在看不出这些说法有什么不合时宜，为什么引起读者的不满？再看看题目“为什么‘放’得不够”，大概作者所要求的是谈“放得不够”的阻力吧，即所谓“感受和意见”吧？他竟没有在这篇访问记中找到所需要的东西，因而不能满足了。
    这就是“为什么‘放’得不够”的第一个例子了。
    还有第二个例子，他在第二段文章中写道：“我还遇到一位‘文艺报’的编辑，据他说有不少读者认为‘文艺报’像是派出所的布告牌。当前文艺界最主要的矛盾是什么？‘文艺报’并没有反映出来。”什么是“最主要的矛盾”呢？他举出了周扬同志几年来对文艺问题的一些报告和文章，说“今天到底应该怎样看法呢？文艺界的许多同志对这些报告和文章是有意见的，能不能展开‘争鸣’呢？这一类‘争鸣’为什么姗姗来迟？”原来是因为没有看到“文艺报”上发表批评周扬同志的“报告和文章”，所以就认为“文艺报”没有反映当前文艺界最主要的矛盾。从来没有人说过周扬同志的文章不能批评，不久前文汇报和“文艺报”上已经有了批评，而且更早一点时间，报纸上刊载的中国作家协会党组召开的座谈会上也有过批评，这是正常的现象。但是，为什么周扬同志的报告和文章成为了“当前文艺界最主要的矛盾”了呢？当他听说“文艺报”编委会决定组织这一类讨论文章的时候，他认为“这是值得我们学习的，学术问题的研究和批判，不应看人而应该看事，‘永远正确’的人是不会有的。”
    我想没有谁反对过对于“学术问题的研究和批判，不应看人而应该看事”。但是这里面却恰恰透露了作者自己的心底里有点“看人”的味道，所以一则说：能不能展开“争鸣”，为什么姗姗来迟？再则说：“永远正确”的人是不会有的；那不是呼之欲出么？
    因此，李今同志认为“放”得不够，要大“放”，“放”就要抓住“当前文艺界最主要的矛盾”，就要抓住“这一些报告和文章”来组织批判，否则，就是“放”得不够。
    当然，对任何人的报告和文章都可以进行“争、鸣”，特别是学术问题，就更需要通过讨论、说理、辩论来解决。但请直说好了，何必兜圈子呢？
    文章还没有完，还有第三个、第四个例子，我想不再赘述了，还是请大家自己去分辨吧。
