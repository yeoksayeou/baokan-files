U.S. subversion activities against socialist countries
Sun Nai

The most insidious and vicious means by which the U.S. imperialists carry out their rampant attacks on socialist countries is to organize subversive activities against socialist countries.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has made subversion of socialist countries an important part of its policy. For more than a decade, the executors of the subversion policy have been expanding their conspiracy activities under the guise of slogans such as "containment," "liberation," and "gradualism."

When the emerging people's democratic countries were born one after another on the Eurasian continent, the schemers in Washington put forward their so-called "containment" policy, the purpose of which was to prevent socialism from winning victories in new regions and to prevent its influence from developing throughout the world. At that time, they crudely interfered in the people's democratic revolution in various countries. In China, after the United States' support for the Chiang Kai-shek group with tens of billions of dollars and military equipment in the anti-communist civil war failed, it carried out military threats and economic blockades against the liberated Chinese mainland, and even launched a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in June 1950, attempting to re-occupy China through Korea. In Eastern European countries, the United States instigated the reactionary parties at that time to seize the fruits of the people's victory through elections or coups. Afterwards, in order to save its failure, the United States continued to expand its espionage and sabotage activities against the Eastern European people's democratic countries, organizing and promoting the so-called "X Plan" and "Common Security Act" for the purpose of carrying out subversion activities.

In 1952, Dulles put forward the so-called "liberation" policy for socialist countries, and soon after, the provocation incident created by the imperialist group in the democratic region of Berlin occurred. From "containment" to "liberation" is a further development of the U.S. policy of subversion against socialist countries. A statement issued by the White House in early 1956 stated: "Liberating" the people of all people's democratic countries "has been, is, and will continue to be the main goal of American foreign policy, and we will never give up until we achieve our goal"!

Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially since the Hungarian incident, the subversive activities of the U.S. imperialists against socialist countries have greatly intensified. The U.S. spy organization's instigation and support for the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots is the most obvious example. During this period, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern European countries successively cracked U.S. espionage cases.

While stepping up espionage and sabotage activities, U.S. imperialists have also expanded their attacks on socialist countries from the ideological front. They started up all propaganda machines, wantonly distorted and slandered socialist countries, slandered the socialist system and the working class party, and provoked relations between socialist countries. After the imperialist subversion conspiracy was completely smashed by socialist countries, the subversion activity strategists in Washington have now put forward the so-called "gradual" proposition.

The United States has established a huge spy organization in order to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries.

U.S. spy organizations are divided into government agencies and non-government agencies. The so-called "Overseas Activities Coordination Committee" established under the National Security Council in 1953 is the headquarters for subversion activities, and all sabotage activities of government and non-government agencies are planned uniformly by it. Recently, U.S. Senator Douglas proposed a bill suggesting the establishment of a "Liberation Affairs Agency" directly led by the U.S. President.

U.S. government agencies engaged in subversion activities include the Central Intelligence Agency, the Special Operations Research Bureau of the Department of Defense, the United States Information Service, and the International Cooperation Administration. The largest of these is the Central Intelligence Agency, which has thousands of branches under it. The Special Operations Research Bureau has special forces and "commandoes." The United States Information Service has 360 branches in 79 countries specializing in anti-communist propaganda; it also owns a unified broadcasting system—the Voice of America, with more than 40 relay stations abroad. In addition to collecting economic intelligence, the International Cooperation Administration also provides funds for the military organizations of exiles from various countries and implements the "Refugee Aid Plan."

In terms of non-governmental organizations, there are organizations such as the "Ford Foundation" and the "Rockefeller Foundation" that carry out bribery activities, as well as various committees and associations that lead foreign exile groups and terrorist organizations. Among these committees, the notorious "Free Europe Committee" has branches in many Western European countries, and the "Free Europe" radio station is also under its leadership. In February of this year, an organization called the "Citizens Committee for Foreign Policy" was established in Washington. The head of the committee is military spy leader Wedemeyer.

The United States is colluding with the intelligence organizations of other countries in carrying out subversive activities, such as using the West German "Gehlen Organization" and the "West Berlin Party East Bureau" to carry out sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Germany. The intelligence organization of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, which is controlled by the United States, is actually a branch of the United States' subversive activities against the Chinese mainland.

The scale of U.S. subversive activities against socialist countries can also be seen from the funds it uses in this area. The U.S. government has allocated more than 600 million U.S. dollars to carry out sabotage activities against socialist countries in accordance with the amendments to the "Common Security Act." According to U.S. newspapers, the Central Intelligence Agency's annual budget is around 1 billion U.S. dollars; and the total amount of U.S. funds used in various aspects to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries amounts to several billion U.S. dollars each year.

The methods of U.S. espionage activities are unscrupulous. Sherman Kent, a major spy of the Central Intelligence Agency, wrote in his book "Strategic Intelligence for U.S. Foreign Policy": "When listing these methods, we should start with spreading rumors. This includes instigating treason, intimidation, terrorist means, bribery, blackmail, sabotage of all kinds, violent kidnapping, assassination, ambush, establishing mobile sniper teams (guerrillas) and underground armies." Obviously, the ways in which the United States conducts espionage activities are far more than these. They also send propaganda balloons to socialist countries, dig tunnels and eavesdrop on telephones, and use Red Cross planes to transport counter-revolutionaries and ammunition during the Hungarian incident, etc.

What kind of people do the espionage and sabotage activities organized by the Americans against socialist countries rely on? According to past disclosures, they mainly rely on those traitors and scum who betrayed their motherland and defected to U.S. imperialism. These exiles include former members of reactionary parties in socialist countries, former fascists, criminal offenders, remnants of reactionary classes, speculators, imperialists in religious cloaks, and all other kinds of people who hate socialism. They form various exile organizations and carry out activities under the leadership of U.S. intelligence agencies.

U.S. subversive activities against socialist countries are also supported by the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and the remnants of the overthrown exploiting classes within these countries.

When carrying out subversive activities against socialist countries, the executors of the U.S. "liberation" policy also tried to win over and deceive those who were dissatisfied with the socialist system and had capitalist ideas to serve them.

It should be said that the social foundation for U.S. imperialists to carry out subversive activities is extremely weak, and as the socialist construction cause of various countries continues to develop and the world peace cause becomes increasingly consolidated, this foundation will become weaker and weaker. The practice of the development of all socialist countries shows that it is not the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system that are destined to "disappear," but the illusions of the Dulles and his like.

However, the people of socialist countries have deeply realized from years of struggle that subverting socialist countries is an unchangeable nature of U.S. imperialists. Any negligence towards the subversive conspiracy of imperialists will bring damage to the socialist cause.

    美国对社会主义国家的颠覆活动
    孙乃
    美帝国主义者对社会主义国家进行猖狂进攻的最阴险最毒辣的手段，是组织对社会主义国家的颠复活动。
    第二次世界大战结束后，美国就把颠复社会主义国家当作它的一项重要政策。十多年来，颠复政策的执行者在“遏制”、“解放”和“渐进”等口号的掩护下日益扩大他们的阴谋活动。
    当新兴的人民民主国家先后在欧亚大陆诞生的时候，华盛顿的阴谋家提出了他们所谓的“遏制”政策，其目的是阻止社会主义在新的地区获得胜利，阻止它的影响在全世界的发展。这时，他们对各国的人民民主革命进行了粗暴的干涉。在中国，美国在以数十亿美元和军事装备支持蒋介石集团进行的反共内战失败以后，又对解放了的中国大陆进行了军事威胁和经济封锁等措施，甚至在1950年6月发动了侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，妄图通过朝鲜来重新侵占中国。在东欧各国，美国嗾使当时的反动政党，通过选举或发动政变来夺取人民胜利的果实。之后，美国为挽救它的失败，不断扩大它对东欧人民民主国家的间谍破坏活动，组织和推行以实行颠复活动为目的的所谓“X计划”和“共同安全法”。
    1952年，杜勒斯提出了所谓“解放”社会主义国家的政策，之后不久，就发生了帝国主义集团在柏林民主区制造的挑衅事件。从“遏制”到“解放”，是美国对社会主义国家实行颠复政策的进一步发展。1956年年初白宫发表的声明中说：“解放”各人民民主国家的人民，“过去、现在和将来一直是美国外交政策的主要目的，不达目的决不罢休”！
    苏共第二十次代表大会以后，特别是从匈牙利事件以来，美帝国主义者对社会主义国家的颠复活动大大加剧起来。美国特务组织对匈牙利反革命暴乱的策动和支持是最显明的例证。在此期间，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克以及东欧其他国家，都陆续破获了美国间谍案件。
    美帝国主义者在加紧间谍破坏活动的同时，也扩大了从思想战线上对社会主义国家的进攻。他们开动一切宣传机器，肆意对社会主义国家进行歪曲和污蔑，诋毁社会主义制度和工人阶级政党，挑拨社会主义国家之间的关系。在帝国主义的颠复阴谋被社会主义国家彻底粉碎以后，现在华盛顿的颠复活动战略家就又提出了所谓“渐进”的主张。
    美国为了对社会主义国家进行颠复活动，建立了庞大的间谍组织。
    美国间谍组织有政府机构和非政府机构两种。1953年在国家安全委员会下设立的所谓“对外活动统筹委员会”，是颠复活动的司令部，所有政府和非政府机构的一切破坏活动都由它统一筹划。最近美国参议员道格拉斯又提出一项法案，建议成立“解放事务署”，由美国总统直接领导。
    从事颠复活动的美国政府机构，有中央情报局、国防部特别作战方法研究局、美国新闻处和国际合作总署等。其中最大的是中央情报局，它的属下有几千个分支机构。特别作战方法研究局下面设有特种部队和“别动队”。美国新闻处在七十九个国家中设有三百六十个专门从事反共宣传的分处；它还拥有一个统一的广播系统——美国之音，在国外设有四十多个转播站。国际合作总署除搜集经济情报外，还给各国亡命之徒的军事组织提供活动经费，以及实施“援助难民计划”。
    在非政府机构方面，有“福特基金会”、“洛克菲勒基金会”之类的进行收买活动的组织，还有领导外国流亡团体和恐怖组织的各种委员会和协会。在这类委员会中，臭名远扬的“自由欧洲委员会”在西欧许多国家设有分支机构，“自由欧洲”电台也归它领导。今年2月，在华盛顿又成立了一个名为“对外政策公民委员会”的组织，委员会的负责人是军事间谍头子魏德迈。
    美国在进行颠复活动时是同其他国家的特务组织勾结在一起的，如利用西德的“盖伦组织”和“西柏林党东方局”，对民主德国进行破坏活动。在美国控制下的台湾蒋介石集团的特务组织，实际上就是美国对中国大陆进行颠复活动的分支机构。
    美国对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的规模之大，也可以从它用于这方面的经费来看。美国政府根据“共同安全法”的修正案，已经拨出六亿多美元来对社会主义国家进行破坏活动。另据美国报刊透露，中央情报局的年度预算就在十亿美元左右；而美国在各方面用于对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的款项，每年共达数十亿美元之巨。
    美国间谍活动的方法是无恶不作的。中央情报局的大间谍舍尔曼·肯特在其所著“为美国对外政策服务的战略情报”一书中写道：“在列举这些方法时，首先应从散布谣言开始。其中包括策动叛国、恫吓、恐怖手段、收买、讹诈、怠工和各种各样的破坏活动、暴力绑架、暗杀、伏击、建立流动狙击队（游击队）和地下军。”显然，美国进行间谍活动的方式决不止这一些，他们还向社会主义国家放送宣传气球，挖地道和偷听电话，以及在匈牙利事件期间利用红十字会的飞机运送反革命分子和弹药等等。
    由美国人组织的对社会主义国家的间谍破坏活动，依靠的是些什么人呢？根据过去揭发的材料，他们主要是靠那些背叛祖国投靠美帝国主义的叛徒和败类。这些逃亡者中有社会主义各国原来的反动党派成员、前法西斯分子、刑事罪犯、反动阶级的残余分子、投机分子、披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子，以及其他形形色色的仇视社会主义的人。他们组成各种流亡者组织，在美国特务机关的领导下进行活动。
    美国对社会主义国家的颠复活动，还得到这些国家内部残存的反革命分子和被推翻的剥削阶级残余的支持。
    美国“解放”政策的执行者在对社会主义国家进行颠复活动时，还力图拉拢和诱骗那些对社会主义制度心怀不满和有着资本主义思想的人物来为他们服务。
    应该说，美帝国主义者进行颠复活动的社会基础是异常薄弱的，而且随着各国社会主义建设事业的不断发展，世界和平事业的日益巩固，这种基础将愈来愈薄弱。一切社会主义国家发展的实践表明，注定要“消逝”的不是共产党的领导和社会主义制度，而是杜勒斯之流的幻想。
    但是，社会主义国家的人民从多年来的斗争中深刻认识到，颠复社会主义国家是美帝国主义者不能改变的本性。对帝国主义者颠复阴谋的任何麻痹大意，都会给社会主义事业带来损害。
