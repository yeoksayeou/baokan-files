The Party Can Lead Science, Can Lead Education, Can Lead Intellectuals
Hua Luogeng's Speech
    First of all, I completely agree with the reports presented at this conference.
    I will now deliver a speech entitled "The Party Can Lead Science, Can Lead Education, Can Lead Intellectuals."

    What kind of life did scientists and professors live before liberation?
    First, please allow me to share some personal recollections. I believe that similar or slightly different suffering experiences are shared by many scientific workers and university professors of my generation. For someone of my age, what came with the title of university professor was not honor, pleasure, or the application of knowledge, but poverty, contempt, and the inability to use one's expertise. I will never forget the situation in the remote countryside of Kunming, in a small room surrounded by livestock, where white papers were swarming with flies and the lamplight was dim at dusk. Even in such an environment, if one managed to produce something, not only would one not receive any encouragement, but there would not even be an opportunity to publish it. It wasn't that there were no houses to live in in Kunming at that time, but the entire salary of a poor professor was not enough to pay the rent! It wasn't that there were no electric lights, but at that time their function seemed to be for "playing mahjong" rather than for reading and scientific research.

    Books and magazines were non-existent! Assistants were non-existent! Even if there were any, they had already run off to Yangon to do business! Yes, at that time it seemed that there was no one to "lead" and one could be "free"! But was there really no leadership? No, at that time the tyrant was forcing us to "freely" move towards death, allowing the seeds of science to "freely" tend towards extinction, not to mention the general principles of comprehensive development, mutual cooperation, and the integration of scientific achievements with national construction! These principles were just extravagant hopes and dreams at that time! Even so, the schools were full of infighting, and the backstabbing activities in the professors' associations made it impossible for any professor to stay out of it. This kind of struggle in a snail's shell was exactly what the Kuomintang reactionary rulers were happy to see. Writing down the past memories could become a book. But even this is enough! It is enough to illustrate the tragic fate of scientific workers and university professors in those years.

    Who made the days of poverty and the inability to use one's expertise a thing of the past?
    However, now a small number of right-wing elements (intellectuals) are using the opportunity of the Party's rectification campaign to issue fallacies, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, and opposing taking the socialist road. This is intolerable to every Chinese person. Among those remarks, there are many that are closely related to us intellectuals. They say, "The CCP organization should withdraw from schools," "Universities should be governed by professors or run democratically," "The Party cannot lead science," "Laymen" cannot lead "experts," "Petty-bourgeois little intellectuals cannot lead petty-bourgeois big intellectuals," and so on. These absurd remarks, in a word, deny the Party's leadership over science, university education, and intellectuals. Those who say such things are either forgetful and have no conscience, or they have ulterior motives. This is resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country, and even more resolutely opposed by the scientific and educational circles of the whole country!

    Search your conscience and compare the past with the present. Who can deny that the speed of development of science and education since liberation is unprecedented in our country's history! What is this due to? Is it due to the efforts of a very small number of scientists and university professors? If that were the case, then these great achievements should have appeared long before liberation. Our past painful lives have shown that these achievements cannot be obtained by professors governing schools, nor can they be created by a number of scientists without organization or leadership! It was the Party's leadership of the revolution, shedding blood, and sacrificing lives that created it for us. Historical lessons have taught us that scientific workers and university professors were helpless and achieved nothing without the leadership of the Communist Party. The past situation has affirmed this point, and today's achievements further prove this point.

    What are our working conditions like today? We have books and magazines, we have assistants, and we have young people to inherit our scientific endeavors. Isn't this what the Party has brought us? The Party's leadership has already brought benefits to the national scientific and educational circles, and it will lead us to a brighter future. We will forever follow the Communist Party, and it will lead us from one victory to another.

    Can't the Communist Party lead scientific work?
    The so-called "laymen" (referring to the Party) cannot lead "experts" (as Qian Weichang said) is an extremely absurd and ridiculous statement. Just ask a question in return, and its poverty will be self-evident. Let him propose it himself! I don't think he can come up with a candidate for university president. Taking a step back, ask him to propose a candidate for department head. If he has some scientific common sense, he cannot propose a suitable candidate according to his principles. Everyone knows how detailed the division of labor in modern science is. It is not that there are no scientists who are proficient in all of science, but it is very rare to find scientists who are proficient in all branches of one science. Therefore, it is impossible to select a department head who meets his conditions, let alone select a president. The meaning of the so-called "laymen" cannot lead "experts" is to deny the possibility of leading science, and of course, it is even more to oppose the leadership of the Party. In reality, it is a right-wing element's conspiracy to have their party lead, not mine.

    Our Communist Party is a Marxist party, and Marxism is the universal truth of science. Therefore, the Party itself is a product of science. Because of its strong scientific nature, it can lead the people of the world in fighting on all fronts and achieve victory. Of course, I am not saying that the Party understands the special topics of various branches of science. I am saying: the general direction, especially the guiding political ideology, guidelines, and policies. Because the Party is always considering the interests of the people, taking a broad and long-term view, and grasping the overall situation, it is the only one that can point out the key points and directions that the country needs to develop.

    Scientific advances without organization are unimaginable, would be inefficient, and would not be closely coordinated with national needs. Organized scientific advances require a "general staff and a general headquarters." This is precisely the responsibility that our Communist Party can and should assume. The Party is fully capable of leading science and education, and not only can it lead, but judging from the achievements of the past few years, it has led extremely well.

    There are also some absurd opinions about the cultivation of youth and the dispatch of students abroad. They have forgotten the purpose of cultivating youth. Our society is a socialist society. We are now cultivating the successors of socialism in the future. The path we are taking is the path to communism. We will never allow the youth we cultivate to be anti-socialist and anti-communist. Unilaterally emphasizing professional work and neglecting political conditions is not in line with the interests of the people. The purpose of these remarks by right-wing elements is to change the political quality of our country's scientific and technological reserve forces, thereby weakening and usurping the proletariat's leadership over science and technology. To repeat, the young people we cultivate should not only be proficient in their professions, but also love socialism and actively participate in the construction of socialist society.

    I am willing to take this as a lesson
    Here, I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about the "Science Planning Group" of the China Democratic League. Under the planning of the Zhang-Luo alliance, without the approval of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League and without consulting the chairman and other vice-chairmen, four working groups were established in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (now it seems that these were ignition groups). One of them was called the "Science Planning Group." They appointed Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, Tong Dizhou, and Qian Weichang to be responsible for drafting a so-called "Several Opinions on the Problems of China's Scientific System." (The details of the process have been reviewed by Qian Jiaju, Hua Luogeng, and Tong Dizhou at the enlarged symposium of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and were published in the Guangming Daily on June 26 under the title "We Were Also Used by Right-Wing Elements Once.") The nature of this draft is, as Guo Lao pointed out: This is an anti-socialist bourgeois program in scientific work.

    In this document, the slogan of "protecting scientists" is used to alienate scientists from the Party and the government, and the slogan of "treating everyone equally" is used to provoke and deceive young people, in an attempt to fundamentally change the socialist nature of our country's scientific work, and to use the method of "restoring" bourgeois social sciences to oppose Marxism. Guo Lao's opinions are completely correct and far more profound than our preliminary review on June 26.

    Although Tong Dizhou and I only attended two meetings and did not participate in the finalization of the draft (later I learned that even the final draft was tampered with, and this group was presided over by Zeng Zhaolun, and the finalized draft was tampered with by Fei Xiaotong, who was invited by Zeng Zhaolun and did not belong to the five-person group; later, on June 5, Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and Fei Xiaotong even absurdly reported the situation to Zhang Bojun, resulting in the scandalous farce of the emergency meeting of six professors on June 6, which stank throughout the country), I did not deny it when I saw the draft and found that there were some principled errors in it. This is an intolerable liberal attitude. Treating political life with a liberal attitude will make you fall for the right-wing elements' tricks at any time.

    This "Science Planning Group" gave us scientific workers a profound lesson. Our political sense is not sharp, and we do not treat political issues with a serious attitude. As a result, we were used by the Zhang-Luo alliance right-wing elements of the China Democratic League, and our names (including Qian Jiaju, Tong Dizhou, and myself) were borrowed to put forward this absurd document as their political capital to attack the Party. This was something we had not anticipated. We have initially realized our mistakes and are willing to take this event as a lesson, strengthen the study of Marxism, gradually establish a communist world view, and resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end.

    The progress of education and scientific work is obvious to all
    I also remember that when I first returned to the motherland in 1950, someone said to me: "He first thought that the Communist Party started in the countryside and might not be able to do urban work, but now it has been proven that they can do it, but whether the economic work is done well or not still needs to be seen." But before long, the market was stabilized, prices did not rise, and industrial construction was advancing in an orderly and rapid manner. Today, even capitalist countries have to admit that our industrial growth rate in 1956 ranked first in the world. Aren't these facts enough to prove that the Communist Party, armed with Marxism, is invincible and unconquerable on any front?

    In recent years, the progress of education and scientific work has been obvious to all. The increase in quantity in just eight years can be compared to dozens or even hundreds of years in the past. On the other hand, it takes a hundred years to cultivate people, and qualitative improvements cannot be achieved overnight! Therefore, some people generalize from the specific and completely deny the achievements of education and science. For example, they absurdly believe that scientific undertakings have regressed since liberation, and that the problem for the next twelve years is not to catch up with the international level, but to make up for the lessons of the past twelve years. These words may only reflect himself. Because of his previous "shallow foundation and empty belly," he was a mediocre professor and had no confidence in catching up with the world level in twelve years, so he shifted the responsibility. I don't know about other things, but as far as mathematics is concerned, the average number of papers published each year since liberation has greatly exceeded the number of papers published in the past. Not only that, but the number of excellent works each year has also exceeded the number of excellent works in the past, but the proportion of excellent works may be slightly lower. But this is precisely because of the phenomenon of many newcomers. This phenomenon is a normal phenomenon in development, and they will continue to improve the quality. The same is true for university graduates. The number of graduates each year has greatly increased, and the number of excellent graduates is also much larger than the number of excellent graduates in the past, but the proportion of excellent graduates may have decreased slightly, but this is a normal phenomenon in development. The work of improving quality has already begun, and in the near future, it will definitely exceed the past in terms of both absolute numbers and proportions. (Taking mathematics as an example, before liberation, one school graduated from three to five people to more than ten people each year, but today it graduates hundreds of people. How can there be fewer than dozens of excellent students among hundreds of people?)

    Despite the fact that right-wing elements are saying discouraging words and lack confidence in the future of our country's scientific development, the objective facts are there for all to see. Our country's science is steadily advancing on an unprecedented scale and speed. Every true scientific worker has confidence that we can, as the Premier instructed at the CPPCC last year, catch up with and approach the world level in major disciplines in twelve years. As for myself, I still guarantee, as I proposed at the CPPCC National Committee last year, to cultivate young people who reach the world level in the three branches of mathematics in twelve years. Judging from the current situation, it is entirely possible to complete this guarantee ahead of schedule due to the leadership and concern of the Party and the government, and the unparalleled enthusiasm of the young people.

    Without the Communist Party, intellectuals would accomplish nothing
    In summary: The Party is definitely able to lead scientific undertakings, lead educational undertakings, and it will definitely be able to lead them well.

    Each of us intellectuals is a soldier in the great march of science. First of all, we must correct our position. When our position is stable and our determination to take the socialist road no longer wavers, we will not intentionally or unintentionally oppose the Communist Party that leads us. We must also step up our study, study Marxism, study the materialistic dialectical method, and care about the fate of the motherland. This will not only enable us to improve our ideological level, but also be infinitely useful in scientific research work. Of course, we must not forget that we serve the motherland through scientific work. Proficiency in professional work, continuous learning, and in-depth research are the requirements for every scientific worker and people's teacher.

    The long-tested Party has pointed out a brilliant future for us. We must always remember that without the guidance of the Party, we will accomplish nothing.

    Welcome criticisms and corrections from the representatives.

### 党能够领导科学，能够领导教育，能够领导知识分子  华罗庚的发言

专栏：

    党能够领导科学，能够领导教育，能够领导知识分子
    华罗庚的发言
    首先我完全同意这次会议上的各项报告。
    我现在以“党能够领导科学，能够领导教育，能够领导知识分子”为题作如下的发言。
    科学家和教授解放前过的什么日子？
    首先请允许我谈一些个人回忆。我相信，相类似的或多或少的苦难经历，正是我们这一代很多科学工作者和大学教授们所都有过的。像我这样一个中等年纪的人，回想当年和大学教授头衔而一齐俱来的，已经不是什么尊荣、愉快和学有所用，而是穷愁、被鄙视和专长莫展。我永远不会忘记，在昆明的偏僻乡村里，与六畜为伍的斗室中的情况，白书则群蝇密集，黄昏则一灯如豆，就是在这样的环境中搞出一些东西来，不但得不到任何鼓励，连个出版的机会都没有。那时候的昆明可以住的房子并不是没有的，但是穷教授的全部薪金那里够付房租呢！电灯也不是没有的，但是那时候它的功能似乎是为了“打麻将”，而不是为了读书，搞科学研究用的。
    书籍杂志不必说了，无有！助手也不必说了，无有！即使有，也早已跑仰光做买卖去了！是的，那时节倒似乎无人“领导”，可以“自由”！但真的无领导吗？不然，那时候的暴君却迫使着我们“自由”地走向死亡，让科学种子“自由”地趋于绝灭，当然更不要说什么全面发展，互相配合，把科学成果与祖国建设结合等大原则了！这些原则，那时候只是奢望，只是梦想！虽然如此，学校里还充满了倾轧，教授会里的勾心斗角活动，使每一个教授都不能置身事外，这种蜗角之争，正是国民党反动统治者求之不得的乐事。把以往的回忆写起来可以成为一本书。但就这一些也就够了！已经足够说明当年的科学工作者和大学教授的悲惨命运了。
    谁使穷愁潦倒和专长无所用的日子一去不返？
    但是现在竟有少数的右派分子（知识分子）利用党整风的机会发出了谬论，反对工人阶级领导的人民民主专政，反对共产党领导，反对走社会主义道路。这是每一个中国人民都不能容忍的。在那些言论中更有不少和我们知识分子切身有关的。他们说：“中共组织退出学校”“在大学里教授治校或民主办校”“党不能领导科学”“外行”不能领导“内行”“无产阶级小知识分子不能领导小资产阶级大知识分子”等等。这些荒谬的言论，总起来一句话，就是否认党对科学、大学教育和知识分子的领导。说这样话的人如果不是健忘，毫无天良，便是别有用心，这是全国人民所坚决反对的，更是全国科学界、教育界所坚决反对的！
    扪一扪良心，比一比既往，谁能否认，解放后科学事业和教育事业的发展速度是我国史无前例的！这是由于什么？难道是由于极少数科学家和大学教授们的努力吗？果真如此，那末这些伟绩应当在解放前早就出现了。我们已往的痛苦生活说明了这些成就不是教授治校所能获得的，也不是没组织没领导的若干科学家所能创造出来的！而是党领导革命、流热血、抛头颅给我们创造出来的，历史教训我们科学工作者和大学教授们在没有共产党领导的时候，是一筹莫展一无所成的，已往的情况已经肯定了这一点，而今天的成绩更证实了这一点。
    今天我们工作条件如何？图书杂志有了，助手有了，继承我们科学事业的青年们也有了，这不是党带来给我们的吗？党的领导已经给全国科学界教育界带来好处，它还将带着我们走上更光明的未来，我们永远地追随着共产党，他将带领我们从一个胜利走上一个胜利。
    共产党不能领导科学工作吗？
    所谓“外行”（指党）不能领导“内行”（钱伟长说），这是一句极为荒谬可笑的话，只要反问一下，其穷自见，请他自己提吧！提出一位大学校长的候选人，我看他无法提得出来的。退一步请他提一位系主任的候选人，如果他有些科学常识的话，也无法照他的原则提出适当人选来的。近代科学分工之细是谁都知道的，不但是精通全部科学的科学家是不存在，就是全通一门科学各个分支的科学家也是极少见的。因此，也就选不出合乎他的条件的系主任，更谈不上选校长了。所谓“外行”不能领导“内行”的意义便是否认了领导科学的可能性，当然更是反对党的领导了。实际上是右派分子的党不能领导我来领导的阴谋诡计。
    我们的共产党是马克思主义的政党，而马克思主义正就是科学的普遍真理。因此，党的本身就是科学的产物，由于它的科学性强，所以才能领导全世界人民在各个战线上进行斗争，获得胜利，当然我不是说，党了解科学的各个分支领域的专题，我是说：一般的方向，特别是有指导性的政治思想，方针和政策。因为党时时刻刻地考虑着人民群众的利益，高瞻远瞩掌握全面，所以唯有它能够指出国家所需要发展的重点和方向等。
    没有组织的科学进军是不可想像的事，会无效率，会不能密切配合国家需要。而有组织的科学进军却需要“总参谋部、总司令部”。这正是我们的共产党所能担当而且应当担当的责任。党是完全能领导科学和教育的，不但能领导，照这几年的成绩看来，它领导得极好。
    对于培养青年和派遣留学生方面，现在也出现了一些荒谬意见，他们忘记了培养青年的目的性，我们的社会是社会主义社会，我们现在培养的是将来的社会主义接班人，我们走的道路是向共产主义的道路，我们决不允许培养出来的青年是反社会主义的，反共产党的。片面地强调业务，而忽视政治条件是和人民利益不相符合的。右派分子的这些言论，其目的在于改变我国科学技术后备队伍的政治质量，从而削弱和篡夺无产阶级对科学技术的领导权。再重复一句，我们培养出来的青年，不但是应当精通业务，而且是热爱社会主义、积极参加建设社会主义社会的人。
    我愿以这件事作为教训
    在这儿我也乘此机会谈一谈民盟所谓“科学规划小组”的事。在章罗联盟策划下，不经民盟中常会通过，不征求主席和其他副主席的意见，在民盟中央成立了四个工作小组（现在看来这是点火小组）。其中之一称为“科学规划小组”。他们指派曾昭抡、千家驹、华罗庚、童第周、钱伟长五人负责，搞出一个所谓“有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”一稿。（关于经过情况已经由千家驹、华罗庚、童第周三人在民盟中央扩大座谈会上检讨，并以“我们也被右派分子利用了一次”为题发表在六月二十六日光明日报上了。）这篇文稿的性质诚如郭老所指出的：这是一个在科学工作方面的反社会主义的资产阶级纲领。
    在这文件中用“保护科学家”的口号来离间科学家和党及政府的关系，用“一视同仁”的口号来对青年进行挑拨和欺骗，企图从根本上改变我国科学工作的社会主义性质，并企图用“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的办法来反对马克思主义。郭老这些意见是完全正确的，并且远远地比我们六月二十六日的初步检讨为深刻。
    虽然我和童第周代表只参加了两次碰头会，并且没有参加定稿（后来知道就是定稿也是被人篡改的，这一小组是曾昭抡主持的，篡改定稿是由曾昭抡邀来的不属于五人小组的费孝通执笔的；后来六月五日曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通更荒谬地去向章伯钧汇报情况，因而产生出臭满全国的六月六日六教授紧急会议的丑剧），但是在见到该稿并且发现其中有一些原则性错误的时候，却未加否认，这是不能容忍的自由主义态度，以自由主义态度来对待政治生活，是随时会上右派分子的当的。
    这次“科学规划小组”给了我们这些科学工作者以一个深刻教训，我们的政治嗅觉不灵，不以认真严肃的态度对待政治问题，结果就为民盟的章罗联盟右派分子们所利用，被假借了我们的名义（我们包括千家驹、童第周及我三人）提出了这一篇荒谬文件，作为他们向党进攻的政治资本，这是我们始料所不及的，我们已初步认识了自己的错误，并愿以这个事件作为教训，加强马克思主义的学习，逐步建立共产主义的世界观，坚决与右派分子斗争到底。
    教育科学工作的进展有目共见
    我还记得，在一九五○年我刚回到祖国的时候，有人对我说：“他先以为共产党是以农村起家的，可能不会搞城市工作，但是现在证明了他们是会搞的，但是经济工作搞得好不好，还得看一看。”但是没有多会儿，市场大稳定，物价不上涨，工业建设更是井井有序的大踏步前进，到了今天连资本主义国家也不得不承认我们的一九五六年的工业增长速度占世界首位了。这些事实难道还不足以证明以马克思主义武装了的共产党，在任何战线上战无不胜，攻无不克吗？
    近年来教育和科学工作的进展都是众所共见的，量的增加短短八年可以抵得上以往几十上百年。另一方面，百年树人，质的改进，不是一朝一夕所易于见功的！因此有人就举偏以概全，全般地否定了教育与科学的成绩。例如荒唐地认为解放后的科学事业倒退了，今后十二年不是赶上国际水平的问题，而是补过去十二年课的问题。这些话也许只反映了他自己，由于已往的“根基浅腹内空”滥竽教授，在十二年内没有赶上世界水平的信心，因而，转移责任。我旁的不了解，就数学而论，解放以来论文的每年的平均篇数大大地超过以往的篇数，不但如此，每年优秀作品的篇数也超过了以往的优秀作品的篇数，但优秀作品的比重可能略低些。但是这正是因为新进者多的现象，这现象是发展中应有的现象，他们会继续提高质量的。大学毕业生也是如此。就每年毕业生的人数来说大大地增加了，其中优秀者的数目也比以往的优秀生的数目大大地增加了，但是优秀生的比重可能减少了些，但这是发展中应有的现象。现在提高质量的工作已经开始了，不久的将来一定会在绝对数字和比例数字方面都超过以往的。（也以数学为例，解放前一校每年毕业生从三、五人到十余人，而今天却几百人，在几百人中优秀者岂能少于几十人。）
    尽管右派分子们在说泄气话，对我国科学发展前途缺乏信心，但客观的事实是摆在面前，我国科学正以前所未有的规模和速度稳步前进，每一个真正的科学工作者都是有信心，我们能够如总理去年在政协所指示的，在十二年内在主要的学科方面赶上和接近世界水平。作为我个人来说，仍然如在去年政协全国委员会上所提出的保证，保证在十二年内在数学的三个分支中培养出达到世界水平的青年。就今天的情况来看，由于党和政府的领导和关怀，由于青年们的无比积极性，提前完成这一保证是完全可能的。
    离开共产党，知识分子就会一事无成
    再总说一句：党是一定能够领导科学事业，领导教育事业的，并且一定能够领导得好的。
    我们每一个知识分子都是科学大进军中的一个战斗员，首先必须端正立场，立场稳了，走社会主义的道路的决心不再动摇了，我们就不会有意无意地反对领导我们的共产党了。我们也必须加紧学习，学习马克思主义，学习唯物辩证方法，关心祖国的命运，这不单能使我们提高思想水平，并且在科学研究工作中也是终身受用不尽的。当然我们也不能忘记我们是通过科学工作来为祖国服务的，业务的精通，日新又新地学习，日深又深地钻研，正是对每一个科学工作者和人民教师的要求。
    久经考验的党已经给我们指出光辉的前途，我们时刻记住离开了党的教导，我们就会一无所成的。
    欢迎代表同志们的批评和指正。
