    Shed the Snail Shell
    Ding Kuiyin

    How can there be a "wall" between the Party and intellectuals? Some say: a Great Wall spans the middle, and the Party must tear it down. This fallacy has been refuted, replaced by the "demolish the wall from both sides" theory. The Party's mass line is precisely the Party's political line. Individual Party members, eroded by non-proletarian ideology, lose their stand, violate the Party's line, and become detached from the masses, so the Party must rectify its work style. The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals demonstrates the Party's special concern for intellectuals; the recent invitation to non-Party members to help rectify the work style shows the Party's sincerity towards intellectuals. The problem lies in the fact that some old intellectuals use their own illusions to build a high wall around themselves, isolating themselves from the era, from the people, and from the Party. This illusory wall dates back to Zi Gong, a disciple of Confucius. He used a palace wall to illustrate that the Dao is too great to be understood by the small-minded, saying, "Ci's wall only reaches the shoulder," "The Master's wall is several fathoms high." Since then, Chinese scholars have always fantasized about building walls around themselves. This invisible wall has its social roots. Old intellectuals who refused to break through this invisible high wall before liberation, after liberation, the revolutionary sunshine revealed that there was no wall built for them by others; they were sheltering in a snail shell, and that shell was the wall they built themselves. The revolution pulls them out and helps them (including me) shed their snail shells. Old intellectuals who have shed their shells naturally thank the Party and thank the revolution. Shedding the shell is painful. Old intellectuals who cannot bear the pain are still sheltering in their snail shells! They feel it is pitch black and that they are separated from the Party by a wall. In fact, there is no question of others demolishing the wall, only the question of shedding one's own shell.

    脱掉蜗牛壳
    丁鷇音
    党和知识分子之间怎么会有“墙”呢？有人说：中间筑有万里长城，要党去拆。这种谬论被驳斥了，代之而起的是“两面拆墙”说。党的群众路线正是党的政治路线。个别党员受了非无产阶级思想的侵蚀，失去立场，违反党的路线，脱离群众，所以党要整风。党对知识分子团结教育改造的政策，说明党特别关心知识分子；最近请党外人士帮助整风，说明党对知识分子推心置腹。问题在于有些旧知识分子用自己的幻想在自己周围筑起一道高墙，害得自己和时代隔绝，和人民隔绝，和党隔绝。这种幻想的高墙，远起于孔门弟子子贡。他用宫墙比喻道大不可小知，他说：“赐之墙也及肩”，“夫子之墙如仞”。从此中国学者总是幻想在自己周围筑墙。这道无形的墙有它的社会根源。在解放前不肯冲出这道无形的高墙的旧知识分子，到了解放以后，革命的阳光，照出他们的周围并没有别人替他们筑的墙，他们是躲在蜗牛壳里安身的，那道壳就是他们自己造的墙。革命拉他们出来，帮助他们（其中包括有我）脱去蜗牛壳。脱了壳的旧知识分子当然感谢党，感谢革命。脱壳是有痛苦的。受不了痛苦的旧知识分子到现在还在蜗牛壳里存身！觉得漆黑一团，觉得他和党隔着一道墙。其实并没有别人拆墙问题，只有自己脱壳问题。
