    New Phenomena After Brain Surgery
    In Warsaw, a sixteen-year-old girl recently underwent surgery to remove the left hemisphere of her brain. The consequences of this surgery have attracted public attention.
    Due to brain inflammation causing changes in the cerebral cortex, the girl's intellectual development had been stuck at the level of an eight-year-old child. After the left hemisphere of her brain was removed, the girl's health continuously improved, mental confusion decreased significantly, and epileptic seizures completely disappeared.
    However, a syndrome appeared after the surgery: the functions of the removed left hemisphere, especially motor and language functions, are gradually being replaced by the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is learning to master new functions step by step. Interestingly, this phenomenon was recently considered completely impossible.

    大脑手术后的新现象
    在华沙，不久前对一个十六岁的女孩实行了大脑左半球的切除手术。这个手术的后果引起了社会上的注意。
    这个女孩因大脑发炎引起了大脑皮质的变化，从而使她的智力发展一直停留在八岁儿童的阶段。实行大脑左半球切除手术后，女孩的健康情况不断好转，精神混乱现象大大减少，羊癎病发作情况完全消失。
    但是，在实行手术后出现一种症候，被切除的大脑左半球的功能，尤其是行动和语言的功能，在逐渐被右半球代替，大脑右半球在一步一步地学会掌握新的功能。有意思的是，这种现象在不久前是认为根本不可能发生的。
