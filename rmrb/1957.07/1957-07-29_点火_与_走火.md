    "Igniting" and "Misfiring"
    Ke Yue
    During the "Great Blooming and Contending" period of helping the Communist Party with its rectification campaign, some anti-communist and anti-socialist individuals emerged as "igniters." They "vowed" and "marched towards the Communist Party," "only talked about shortcomings and not about achievements," and even went as far as to say that "an elephant's trunk could be described as a bamboo tube." Some of them even called for "killing communists." These people had ulterior motives: distorting right and wrong, fearing nothing more than the world being in chaos, their aim being to let the fire spread, burn socialism to death, burn communists to death, and let them "replace them." The masses cannot tolerate these right-wing ambitious individuals. We must extinguish the flames and thoroughly expose these "igniters."
    There are also people who, during the "Great Blooming and Contending," showed that they supported socialism and loved the Communist Party. The vast majority of their opinions were correct, but they also had some incorrect opinions, which can be described as "misfiring." Although some of this "misfiring" was not accidental, indicating that there were still problems with their viewpoints and their political consciousness was not high enough; some were simply due to a lack of ability and a temporary slip of the tongue ("misfiring"). These people, once someone pointed out their mistakes, quickly improved and admitted their errors, and bravely joined the fight against the "igniters." These people should be clearly distinguished from the "igniters," and we should only help them improve their understanding and encourage them to make self-criticisms in order to lay down their "burdens." Because "misfirers" are unintentional, while "igniters" are intentional.
    There is also a third type of people (the majority), whose opinions are sometimes correct and sometimes wrong. They themselves have also "misfired" on certain points, and some have been indifferent to the "igniters," standing idly by. However, these people are wavering and belong to the middle ground. We should sincerely criticize their incorrect aspects, let them unload their heavy "burdens," and strive to get them to join the fight against the "igniters."
    Right-wing elements are "igniters." In order to expand their influence and create chaos, they attempt to bring those who have "misfired" together. We must be wary of this conspiracy. Some right-wing elements try to portray their "igniting" as "misfiring," and we must also expose this trick of theirs.

    “点火”与“走火”
    克约
    在帮助共产党整风的“大鸣大放”中，出现了一些反共、反社会主义的“点火”者。他们“誓师”“向共产党进军”，“只谈缺点，不谈成绩”，“把象鼻子说成竹筒子也可以”，他们中甚至有人号召“杀共产党人”。这种人是有心的：颠倒是非，惟恐天下不乱，目的无非是希望火势蔓延，烧死社会主义，烧死共产党人，由他们“取而代之”。对于这些右派野心家，群众是不能容忍的。一定要扑灭火苗，彻底揭露这些“点火”者。
    也有一种人，在“大鸣大放”中表现他们是拥护社会主义、热爱共产党的，他们所提的意见绝大部分是正确的，但也有一些错误的意见，可以说是“走火”。虽然这种“走火”有的并非偶然，说明他们的观点尚有问题，政治觉悟还不够高；但有的却只是由于水平不够，而一时失言（“走火”）的问题。这些人，一经过别人指出他的错误后，就很快提高一步，承认自己的错误，而勇敢地投入对
  “点火”者的战斗。对于这种人，应与“点火”者截然分开，只能帮助他提高认识，让他勇于作自我批判，以放下“包袱”。因为“走火”者是出于无心，而“点火”者却是有意的。
    还有一种人（多数），他们的意见有的正确，有的错误。他们自己在某些论点上也曾有过“走火”，有的也对“点火”者不闻不问，袖手旁观。但是，这种人是动摇的，属于中间状态的。对他们应该诚恳地批判错误的方面，让他们卸掉沉重的“包袱”，争取他们投入对“点火”者的战斗。
    右派分子是“点火”者。他们为了扩大声势，制造混乱，企图把“走火”的人拉在一起，我们必须当心他们的这种阴谋；有些右派分子则企图把他们的“点火”说成是“走火”，我们也必须揭露他们的这种诡计。
