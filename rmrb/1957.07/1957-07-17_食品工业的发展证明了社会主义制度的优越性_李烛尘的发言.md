I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, and I fully agree with the work reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

From the vivid facts and figures pointed out in the various reports, it can be seen that 1956 was a year in which the Chinese people achieved great victories in socialist construction. This year was a year of great political and economic changes in our country. At the same time, it was a year of great significance for the new victory in 1957 and for welcoming the more magnificent Second Five-Year Plan. The bourgeois right-wing ambitious elements are not happy with these facts and figures. They attempt to obliterate the achievements made by the hard work of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party. The sinister intention hidden in this attempt is to conspire to "disintegrate" the socialist system, "collapse" the Communist Party, and make us regress to the old road of capitalism. Now, under the resolute counterattack of the people of the whole country, their conspiracy has been gradually exposed. We must continue to carry out and deepen this struggle, and we will never stop until we achieve the final victory.

Now, I will introduce the situation in the food industry. From the changes and achievements of the food industry in recent years, it has also powerfully proved the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and the superiority of the socialist system. I would like to ask you to discuss and correct some of my opinions on the future development of the food industry.

Rapid Development of the Food Industry

Food industry products are one of the three major necessities of life: food, clothing, and use. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the people's demand for food has been increasing year by year. Looking at the actual consumption of several major products in 1956 compared with 1952, the increase is very rapid. Edible vegetable oil increased by 56%, sugar by 106%, cigarettes by 49%, salt sales increased by 68% compared with 1952, and alcohol by 61%.

Due to the increasing social needs, the production of the food industry has been rapidly developed. As early as 1952, at the end of the period of national economic recovery, the main products of the food industry had generally exceeded the highest annual output in history. After entering the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the food industry has achieved greater development. In 1956, the total output value of the national food industry (referring to the industries under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food Industry) accounted for more than 10% of the total national industrial output value and more than 19% of the total output value of all consumer goods industries. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the growth of food industry production mainly relied on the exploitation of the potential of old factories, but also, according to needs and possibilities, some new enterprises were planned and constructed. The newly invested enterprises include sugar factories, oil pressing factories, canning factories, wine factories, malt factories, dairy factories, aromatic factories and other food factories.

By 1957, the production level of most products under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food Industry, although restricted by the insufficient supply of agricultural raw materials, was still greatly increased compared with 1952. For example, the planned production of salt in 1957 was 7 million tons, an increase of 40% compared with 1952; the planned production of edible vegetable oil in 1957 was 1.22 million tons, an increase of 24% compared with 1952; the planned output of sugar in 1957 was 874,000 tons, an increase of 93% compared with 1952; the planned production of cigarettes in 1957 was 4.03 million cases, an increase of 55% compared with 1952; the planned production of alcohol in 1957 was 524,000 tons, an increase of 128% compared with 1952; the planned production of soap in 1957 was 242,000 tons, an increase of 106% compared with 1952. The planned output of other products such as canned food, dairy products, and egg products in 1957 increased by more than two times compared with 1952.

The development of the food industry has brought many economic benefits to agriculture and animal husbandry, and has played a great role in strengthening economic cooperation between industry, agriculture and animal husbandry and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. First, the development of the food industry has found a way out for agricultural products that need to be processed, and farmers can exchange the same amount of agricultural products for more industrial products. Second, many by-products of the food industry, such as distiller's grains and beet pulp, are good feed for livestock such as pigs and cattle. For example, a sugar factory that processes 1,000 tons of beet per day produces 150,000 tons of wet pulp per year, which can be mixed with other feed to feed nearly 10,000 cattle and hundreds of thousands of sheep. An alcohol factory with an annual output of 8,000 tons produces 20 tons of distiller's grains per day, which can be mixed with other feed to feed 70,000 pigs per year. Third, the development of the food industry has played an important role in meeting the needs of the vast rural areas, maintaining price stability, and exchanging industrial products for agricultural products.

The rapid development of the food industry has not only adequately met the needs of the people's lives and promoted the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, but also accumulated a large amount of funds for the country. According to the estimate of the five-year accumulation (including industrial and commercial profits and taxes) of four products including salt, sugar, alcohol, and cigarettes, it will be more than 10 billion yuan. The export products such as canned food, egg products, and dairy products have also exchanged a large amount of foreign exchange, which has strongly supported the country's economic construction.

It is not difficult to see that the achievements of the food industry in the past few years are the main ones. It has played a good role in the national economy and the people's livelihood, and has greatly promoted the socialist construction of our country. However, since our country is a large country with a population of 600 million, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the quantity of food needed is extremely huge. For example, if everyone in the country eats one more jin of oil per year, it will be necessary to increase the production of 300,000 tons of oil per year; if everyone in the country eats half a jin of sugar more per year, it will be necessary to increase the production of 150,000 tons of sugar per year. Therefore, since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, although the food industry has achieved greater development, it still cannot keep up with the growing needs of the people. The supply of many foods in the market is tight. On the one hand, it shows that the lives of the people in our country have indeed greatly improved. On the other hand, it also shows that the food industry still needs to be greatly developed in the future.

Now, I would like to focus on several issues closely related to the development of the food industry.

Actively Open Up Sources of Raw Materials

First of all, the issue of raw materials for the food industry is the biggest contradiction currently encountered by the food industry. Although economic crops have increased significantly in recent years. Taking 1949 as the base, by 1956, the output of beets increased by 749%, sugarcane increased by 242%, peanuts increased by 171%, sesame increased by 9%, rapeseed increased by 34%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 906%, and livestock products increased by 65%. However, as Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "In recent years, all localities have attached importance to increasing the production of grain and cotton, which is entirely necessary. However, some localities have paid insufficient attention to the increase in other agricultural economies, excluding cotton, various economic crops, animal husbandry..." We can see from the following aspects that some economic crops such as peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame have not completed the plan since 1954. Sugarcane and beets have also failed to complete the plan for two years, and the planting plan for 1957 has not been completed; many economic crop varieties are not good, the content of effective ingredients is not high, and the promotion of excellent varieties and the guidance of cultivation techniques are not enough. For example, local sugarcane varieties still account for about 40% of the national sugarcane; in some areas of Northeast China, the yield and sugar content of beets have been affected due to the lack of attention to reasonable crop rotation, and tobacco seeds tend to degenerate; insufficient efforts have been made to open up sources of raw materials, especially economic crops that do not compete with grain for land. For example, 40% of oil tea forests, which are woody oil plants, have not yet been restored. Pineapples, coconuts, sunflower seeds, and some herbaceous and woody aromatic plants do not require good land to grow, but they have not been well developed. The purchase price of some agricultural raw materials is too low, which also affects the enthusiasm of producers; in the past few years, there has been insufficient coordination between industrial and agricultural plans, and food industry raw materials have not been well unified in planning and arrangement. All of these have affected the supply of food industry raw materials. However, it should be stated that in recent years, the industrial sector itself has done a very poor job in actively assisting the agricultural sector in the planning of agricultural raw materials and the selection and breeding of excellent varieties. Except for some experimental research and breeding and promotion work in cooperation with the agricultural sector in sugarcane and beets, which have achieved some results, other aspects have hardly cooperated with the agricultural sector in doing any work, which needs to be improved by us in the future.

According to the above situation, in order to solve the contradiction of insufficient supply of food raw materials, we believe that it is necessary to pay close attention to solving the following aspects:

A. It is necessary to pay attention to improving raw material varieties to increase the yield per unit area and the content of effective ingredients in raw materials. Regarding increasing the yield per unit area of economic crops, in addition to gradually improving agricultural production technology, increasing and improving fertilizer supply conditions, building water conservancy, and promoting advanced experience, it is also necessary to start with improving raw material varieties and quality, because there is great potential in this regard. For example, the sugar yield per unit area of local sugarcane varieties and improved varieties differs by one to three times. In oil crops, excellent varieties of rapeseed and general varieties in the same area and under the same conditions differ by about 50 jin per mu in yield, and the oil content differs by 10%. Therefore, the oil yield per mu differs by more than one time. It should be pointed out here that it is also wrong to pay one-sided attention to high unit yield without considering the content of effective ingredients in raw material quality. For example, although the unit yield of beets has increased, the sugar content has decreased, resulting in a reduction in the sugar yield per unit area, which not only cannot increase industrial production, but also damages the interests of the country. Therefore, in addition to requiring the agricultural sector to strengthen the selection and promotion of improved varieties, it is recommended that under the unified leadership of the agricultural sector, the agricultural, land reclamation, forestry, and food sectors should respectively establish necessary experimental farms and improved seed breeding farms. This will promote the close integration of industry and agriculture, and will be more conducive to the development of variety improvement and quality work.

B. Actively open up new sources of raw materials and develop economic crops that do not compete with grain for land. In China, with its large population and little arable land, it is of great practical significance to vigorously develop new sources of raw materials in order to increase the supply of food raw materials, especially to develop economic crops that do not compete with grain for land. According to preliminary estimates, if all oil tea forests are restored to the pre-war level of 20 million mu, and each mu produces about 40 jin of oil, about 200,000 to 300,000 tons of tea oil can be increased. Obviously, there is great potential for increasing raw material production by working hard in this area.

C. Plan for raw material bases for the food industry as soon as possible. This is the most fundamental issue. In the past, the food industry did not pay enough attention to the planning of raw material bases. Some industries that need raw material bases have not yet begun to plan for the establishment, and the raw material bases that have been formed in the past, such as tobacco leaves and oil materials, have not played their due role due to lack of planning, so that in recent years, the food industry has felt increasingly passive in the supply of raw materials with the development requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that the State Planning Commission and the agricultural sector, without affecting the development of grain and cotton, unify planning and establish raw material bases for major industries to fundamentally solve the problem of raw material supply.

D. The issue of allocation and transfer of raw materials. At present, many food industries still have to rely on the intermediate link of the commercial sector for the allocation and transfer of raw materials, which often makes it difficult to guarantee the production arrangements of the industrial sector. Therefore, can the following be considered regarding the allocation and transfer of raw materials: 1. Some raw materials can be purchased uniformly by the urban service sector, and the industrial sector can cooperate with the service sector to formulate allocation plans and carry out transfer and supply; 2. Some raw materials that use grain as raw materials will still be uniformly allocated and transferred by the grain sector; 3. Some raw materials can be directly entrusted by the industrial sector to the supply and marketing cooperatives for purchase, and the industrial sector will carry out allocation and transfer; 4. Some raw materials should be made possible for factories to directly sign raw material supply contracts with agricultural cooperatives. In short, improving the allocation and transfer of raw materials must proceed from the standpoint of minimizing long-distance transportation, reducing intermediate links, ensuring raw material supply, and reducing production costs to facilitate production.

E. It is necessary to reasonably adjust the price of purchased raw materials. Adjusting the prices of raw materials with low purchase prices is of great significance for stabilizing and developing production. However, the adjusted prices must be reasonable, and the adjustment steps can only be gradual. Regarding some areas where the purchase price of cottonseed is only equal to the price of cottonseed cake, or even lower than the price of cottonseed cake, and the purchase price of some wild resources is too low, affecting the farmers' unwillingness to collect, reasonable adjustments should be made to these situations as soon as possible.

The above are some of my opinions on the agricultural raw materials of the food industry.

Make Full Use of Existing Raw Materials

Second, regarding the issue of increasing production and saving in the food industry. The fundamental issue of developing the food industry is to develop agricultural raw materials. However, our industrial sector itself also has great potential in the utilization of agricultural raw materials, which is what we should first strive for in the industrial sector.

In terms of raw material utilization in the food industry, the difference between advanced and backward is very large. For example, the oil yield of the same 100 jin of oil material in local oil mills differs by 2-3 jin, and the oil yield of raw materials with high oil content differs by 3-6 jin. The refining rate of crude cottonseed oil is above 94% in Jinan Oil Factory, while it is only 91-92% in other oil factories with the same conditions. The starch alcohol yield of Baijiu factories in Hebei Province averaged 70% in the province in 1956, as high as 75.8% in Zhuoxian Baijiu Factory, and only about 56% in Shangdu Winery. The sugar yield of local sugarcane sugar is 10.5% in Fujian and only 7.34% in Guangxi; the total sugar loss rate of beet sugar in mechanical production is only 2.9% in Acheng, while it is above 3.3% in Youyi, Hongguang, and Heping factories. One-sixth of the waste liquid from soap factories across the country has not yet recovered glycerin, and the secondary fruits and fruit peels in canning factories, the distiller's grains of some alcohol and Baijiu factories, and the beet pulp and filter mud of sugar factories have not been fully and rationally utilized.

According to the above situation, it is very necessary for the food industry sector to launch a production increase and economy movement across the country. Our main requirements are:

In the salt industry: In 1957, in addition to striving to complete the national plan of 7 million tons, another 560,000 tons will be produced. Thanks to the active efforts of salt industry workers, the attention and support of local party and government leaders, and the strong assistance of local troops in some areas, the difficulties of insufficient labor force in the peak production season were solved in a timely manner. Therefore, by the end of June, the national crude salt output had completed 4.57 million tons. It is estimated that if there are no major disasters, the annual crude salt can be strived to complete more than 7 million tons.

In the oil industry, the national edible oil production will be increased by 80,000 tons throughout the year, requiring most local oil mills to increase the oil yield by an average of 1%; strive to process and squeeze oil from a part of the feed soybeans reserved for rural use in small mechanical oil mills or local oil mills; use rice bran from some grain processing factories in large and medium-sized cities to squeeze oil, and increase the oil yield of mechanical squeezing and the refining rate of cottonseed oil, requiring mechanical oil factories to increase the oil yield by an average of 0.5%.

In the sugar industry, it is required to increase production by 45,000 tons in the next production period, 15,000 tons of which belong to the fourth quarter of this year's pressing season. Among them, the national mechanical sugar factories will increase the production of 11,000 tons of sugar from improving the total sugar yield in the next production period; local sugar workshops can increase the production of about 12,000 tons of sugar by an average of 0.7% by promoting the experience of adding water to squeeze; and increasing the harvest of sugarcane by implementing small hoes and low cuts can increase the production by 21,000 tons.

In the winemaking industry, it is required that the national Baijiu increase the starch alcohol yield by 5% for Xiaoqu Baijiu and 2% for Daqu Baijiu on the basis of 1956, which can increase the production of 12,000 tons of 65-degree Baijiu and save 30,000 tons of grain, and further solve the problem of distiller's grain utilization to increase pig feed.

Other industries such as cigarettes, canned food, dairy products, egg products, and soap should strive to obtain raw materials, actively use substitutes, and reduce waste according to different situations to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan.

Judging from the results of the implementation in the first half of this year, thanks to the leadership of party and government at all levels, the Ministry of Food Industry has begun to achieve some results in increasing production and saving. I believe that as long as all our workers make further efforts and the relevant departments support it, especially the party and government leading organs in various places urge and check more, it is expected that greater results will be achieved.

Improve Industrial Management Forms

Third, the issue of improving the management form of the food industry, that is, the issue of improving the industrial system. First of all, I fully support Premier Zhou's proposal in the "Government Work Report": In the past two years, in order to correct the shortcomings of excessive centralization and overly strict control by the central government in some aspects, we have also studied the issue of the system. Now the government is preparing to appropriately expand local powers so as to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the localities under the centralized leadership of the central government and promote the socialist construction cause. However, regarding the issue of improving the management system of the food industry, in addition to first solving the upper and lower relations between the central government and the localities and expanding local powers, it is also necessary to solve the problem of multi-headed leadership that currently exists in the food industry, that is, an industry in some food industries belongs to the leadership of several departments, thus hindering the overall planning and unified arrangement of these industries. It is recommended that an industry should in principle be uniformly planned and managed by one department to overcome the drawbacks of the current multi-headed leadership.

Finally, I want to emphasize that some of the difficulties currently existing in the food industry are difficulties in development. I firmly believe that these difficulties will be gradually resolved. The food industry in our country will also continue to develop with the socialist construction and the continuous improvement of people's lives. A broad future is unfolding before us. There are many shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the food industry. I hope to hear the criticisms of the representatives so that we can strive to improve.

    食品工业的发展证明了社会主义制度的优越性
    李烛尘的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长所作的各项工作报告。
    从各个报告所指出的活生生的事实和数字中可以看出，1956年是我国人民在社会主义建设方面取得了伟大的胜利的一年。这一年是我国在政治上、经济上大变化的一年。同时，又是为1957年新的胜利和迎接更加宏伟的第二个五年计划有重要意义的一年。资产阶级右派野心家们是不会高兴这些事实和数字的，他们企图一笔抹杀共产党所领导下的全国人民辛勤劳动所获得的成绩，他们这个企图所包藏着的祸心，就是阴谋使社会主义制度“解体”，使共产党“垮台”，使我们倒退到资本主义的老路。现在在全国人民的坚决回击之下，他们的阴谋逐步被揭露出来，我们一定要继续开展和深入这个斗争，不取得最后胜利，决不收兵。
    现在，我就食品工业方面的情况作一些介绍，从食品工业近几年来的变化和成绩当中，也有力地证明了共产党领导的正确性和社会主义制度的优越性。对于我谈到今后发展食品工业方面的一些意见，请大家讨论指正。
    食品工业迅速发展
    食品工业的产品是人们吃、穿、用三大重要生活资料之一。几年来，随着人民生活不断改善，人民对食品的需要在逐年增长，从几种主要产品1956年比1952年实际生活消费量来看，增长是很快的，食用植物油增长56％，食糖106％，卷烟49％，盐的销售比1952年增长68％，酒类61％。
    由于社会需要日益增长，这就促使了食品工业生产获得了迅速的发展。早在国民经济恢复终结时期的1952年，食品工业的主要产品一般已经超过了历史上最高年产量。当进入了第一个五年建设计划期以后，食品工业又获得了较大的发展，1956年全国食品工业总产值（指食品工业部所主管的行业）已占全国工业总产值10％以上，占全部消费资料工业总产值19％以上。在第一个五年计划期内，食品工业生产的增长，基本上依靠旧厂潜力的发挥，但也根据了需要和可能，有计划地进行了一些新企业的基本建设、新投入的企业有制糖厂、榨油厂、罐头厂、葡萄酒厂、麦芽厂、乳品厂、芳香厂以及其他食品厂。
    到1957年，食品工业部所主管的大多数产品的生产水平，虽然受到了农业原料供应不足的限制，但比1952年仍然有较大的增长。例如盐1957年计划生产700万吨，比1952年提高40％，食用植物油1957年计划生产122万吨，比1952年提高24％，食糖1957年计划产量87.4万吨，比1952年提高93％，卷烟1957年计划生产量403万箱，比1952年提高55％，酒类1957年计划生产量52.4万吨，比1952年提高128％，肥皂1957年计划生产量24.2万吨，比1952年提高106％。其他如罐头、乳制品、蛋制品、1957年计划产量比1952年增长二倍以上。
    食品工业的发展，给农牧业带来许多经济上的好处，对于加强工农牧业之间的经济合作，巩固工农联盟，起了很大作用。第一、食品工业的发展，为需要加工的农产品找来了出路，农民可以用同等数量的农产品换取较多的工业品。第二、许多食品工业的副产品如酒糟、甜菜废丝等，正是猪和牛等牲畜的良好饲料，如一个日处理甜菜1，000吨的糖厂，每年产湿废丝15万吨，掺用其他饲料，可喂牛近万只，羊十几万只。一个年产8，000吨的酒精厂，每天的酒糟就达20吨，掺用其他饲料，年可喂猪7万头。第三、食品工业的发展，对满足广大农村需要，保持物价稳定，用工业品交换农业品等，起了重要的作用。
    食品工业的迅速发展，不仅适当地满足了人民生活的需要和促进了农牧业的发展，而且也为国家积累了大量资金。根据盐、食糖、酒、卷烟等四种产品的五年积累（包括工、商利润和税金）的估计，将有一百亿元以上。仅罐头、蛋制品、乳制品等出口产品也换回了大量外汇，有力地支援了国家的经济建设。
    不难看出，过去几年食品工业的成绩是主要的，它对于国计民生都起了良好的作用，因而大大地促进了我国的社会主义建设事业。但是，由于我国是一个拥有六亿人口的大国，随着人民生活不断改善，所需要的食品的数量是极其巨大的，例如全国每人每年多吃一斤油，一年就需要增产30万吨油；全国每人每年多吃半斤糖，一年就需要增产15万吨糖。所以在第一个五年计划执行以来，食品工业虽然是有了较大的发展，但仍然跟不上人民日益增长的需要，许多食品市场供应紧张，这一方面表明了我国人民生活确实有了很大改善，另一方面也表明了食品工业今后还须要大力发展。
    现在，我想着重谈谈与发展食品工业有密切关系的几个问题。
    积极开辟原料来源
    首先关于食品工业的原料问题，这是当前食品工业遇到的最大的矛盾。虽然几年来经济作物是有较大增大的。如以1949年为基数，到1956年甜菜产量增加749％，甘蔗增加242％，花生增加171％，芝麻增加9％，油菜子增加34％，烤烟增加906％，畜产品增加65％，但是正如周总理在八大
  “关于发展国民经济计划的第二个五年计划的建议报告”中指出“这几年来，各地方重视了粮食和棉花的增产，这是完全必要的，但是，有些地方却因而对其他农业经济除棉花以外的各种经济作物、畜牧业……的增产注意得不够。”我们从以下几方面可以看出有些经济作物如花生、菜子、芝麻自1954年以来一直没有完成计划。甘蔗、甜菜也有两年没有完成计划，1957年播种计划也没有完成；不少经济作物品种不好，有效成分的含量不高，优良品种推广工作和耕作技术指导作的不够，例如全国甘蔗中土种还占到40％左右；东北某些地区的甜菜由于没有注意合理轮作，曾影响了甜菜产量和含糖分的下降，烟叶的种子有退化的趋向；在开辟原料来源，特别是同粮食不争地的经济作物方面也做的不够，例如木本油料中的油茶林，就有40％尚未恢复，菠萝、椰子、葵花子和一部分草本、木本的芳香植物等等，都是不需要好地来种植的，但没有得到很好地发展。某些农业原料的收购价偏低，也影响了生产者的积极性；过去几年来工、农业计划协作不够，食品工业原料没有很好统一规划和安排，所有这些，都影响了食品工业原料的供应。但应该说明，几年来，工业部门本身主动地协助农业部门进行农业原料的规划和选育优良品种等方面的工作是做得很差的。除了在甘蔗和甜菜方面配合农业部门作了一些优良品种的试验研究和繁殖推广的工作，并得到一些成绩外，其他方面几乎没有配合协助农业部门做什么工作，这是需要我们今后改善的。
    根据上述情况，为了解决食品原料供应不足的矛盾，我们认为必须很好地注意解决以下几个方面的问题：
    甲、必须注意改进原料品种，以提高单位面积产量和原料的有效成分的含量。关于提高经济作物的单位面积产量，除了逐步地改进农业生产技术，增加和改进肥料供应条件，兴修水利，推广先进经验外，还必须从改进原料品种和质量着手，因为这方面潜力是很大的。例如，甘蔗土种与良种单位面积产糖量要差一倍到三倍。油料作物中的菜子优良品种与一般品种在同一地区同一条件下，每亩产量相差50斤左右，含油率相差10％，因此每亩产油量就相差一倍以上。在这里需要指出的片面的注意单位产量高，不考虑原料品质的有效成分含量，也是不对的。例如甜菜单位产量虽然提高了，但含糖分下降了，结果反而使单位面积产糖量减少，这不但不能增加工业生产，而且损害了国家的利益。因此，我们除了要求农业部门加强良种的选育和推广的工作外，建议在农业部门的统一领导下，由农业、农垦、林业、食品各部门分别建立必要的试验场和良种繁殖场，这样做，将促使工业和农业紧密结合，更有利于改进品种和质量工作的开展。
    乙、积极开辟新的原料来源，发展同粮食不争地的经济作物。在我国人口多耕地少的情况下，为了增加食品原料供应，大力开展新的原料来源，特别是发展同粮食不争地的经济作物有着很大的现实意义。根据初步估算，如果油茶林全部恢复到战前2.000万亩水平，使每亩产油达到40斤左右，约可增产20—30万吨茶油。显然从这方面来下功夫，原料增产就大有可为了。
    丙、及早地对于食品工业原料基地加以规划，这是最带有根本性的问题。过去食品工业对于原料基地的规划工作是注意的不够的。有些需要原料基地的行业到现在还没有着手筹划建立，过去已经形成原料基地的如烟叶、油料等，由于没有加以规划，也没有发挥应有的作用，以致最近几年来食品工业在原料供应问题上随着发展的要求，越来越感到被动。因此，建议国家计委和农业部门在不影响发展粮棉的原则下，统一规划和建立主要行业的原料基地，从根本上来解决原料的供应问题。
    丁、原料的分配调拨问题。目前不少食品行业，原料的调拨分配，还必须依靠商业部门这一中间环节，结果往往使得工业部门的生产安排，不易得到保证。因此，关于原料的分配调拨问题可否考虑：1．有些原料可由城市服务部门统一收购，由工业部门协同服务部门制订分配方案，进行调拨供应；2．有些用粮食作原料的，则仍由粮食部门统一分配调拨；3．有些原料，可以由工业部门直接委托供销合作社代购，由工业部门进行分配调拨；4．有些原料尽可能使工厂直接和农业社签订原料供应合同。总之改进原料的分配调拨工作，必须从尽量减少长途运输，减少中间环节，保证原料供应，降低生产成本有利于生产出发。
    戊、必须合理地调整收购原料的价格。对于收购价格偏低的原料应加以调整，这对于稳定和发展生产是有很大作用的。但调整的价格必须合理，调整的步骤也只能是逐步的，关于像有些地区，棉子收购价格只等于棉子饼的价格，甚至还低于棉子饼的价格，有些野生的资源收购价过低，影响到农民不愿采集，对于这些情况，应该及早作合理的调整。
    以上就是我对于食品工业的农业原料方面的一些意见。
    充分利用现有原料
    第二，关于食品工业的增产节约问题。发展食品工业的根本问题是发展农业原料。但是，我们工业部门本身在农业原料的利用方面，也有很大潜力，这是我们工业方面应当首先努力的。
    食品工业的原料利用方面，在先进与后落之间相差是很悬殊的。如土榨油坊中用同样百斤油料的出油率高低相差2—3斤含油高的原料出油率相差3—6斤，毛棉油精炼率，济南油厂达94％以上，而其他条件相同的油厂仅为91—92％。河北省白酒厂的淀粉出酒率，1956年全省平均为70％，涿县白酒厂高达75.8％，而商都酒厂仅有56％左右。甘蔗土糖产糖率，福建为10.5％，广西只有7.34％；机制甜菜糖总损失率，阿城只有2.9％，友宜、红光、和平三厂则在3.3％以上。肥皂工厂的废液全国尚有六分之一没有回收甘油，罐头工厂中的次果、果皮，有些酒精厂和白酒厂的酒糟，糖厂的甜菜废丝与滤泥等，都还未得到充分的合理利用。
    根据上述情况，食品工业部门在全国范围内开展一个增产节约运动，是十分必要的，我们主要要求：
    在制盐工业方面：1957年除了要求争取完成国家计划700万吨外，再增产56万吨。由于盐业职工积极努力，各地党政领导重视支持以及有些地区当地驻军大力协助，及时解决了旺产季度劳动力不足等困难问题，因而到6月底全国原盐产量已完成457万吨，预计如无大的灾害全年可以争取完成原盐700万吨以上。
    油脂工业方面，全年全国增产食油8万吨，要求大多数土榨油坊出油率平均提高1％；在小型机榨油厂或土榨油坊对农村留用的饲料大豆争取一部分加工榨油；在大、中城市利用部分粮谷加工厂的米糠进行榨油，并提高机榨的出油率和棉油的精炼率，要求机榨油厂平均提高出油率0.5％。
    制糖工业方面，要求下一个生产期，增产4.5万吨，属于今年第四季榨季的1.5万吨，其中全国机制糖厂在下一个生产期从提高总得糖率中增产1.1万吨食糖；土糖坊在推广加水压榨的经验中平均提高总得糖率0.7％，约可增产1.2万吨糖。推行小锄低砍，多收甘蔗可增产2.1万吨。
    酿酒工业方面，要求全国白酒在1956年基础上，小曲酒提高淀粉出酒率5％，大曲酒提高2％，可增产65度白酒1.2万吨，节约粮食3万吨，并进一步解决酒糟利用问题，以增加养猪的饲料。
    其他如卷烟、罐头、乳制品、蛋制品、肥皂等若干行业，则应根据不同情况大力争取原料，积极采用代用品，减少浪费，保证完成和超额完成国家计划。
    从今年上半年执行的结果来看，由于各级党政的领导，食品工业部已经在增产节约方面开始获得了一些成绩，我相信只要我们全体职工作进一步的努力，各有关部门加以支持，特别是各地党政领导机关多加督促检查，预计一定会取得更大的成绩。
    改进工业管理形式
    第三，关于改进食品工业管理形式的问题，也即是改进工业体制问题。首先是我完全拥护这次周总理在“政府工作报告”中提出的：近两年来，为了纠正中央在某些方面集中过多，统得过严的缺点，我们又研究了体制问题，现在政府正准备适当地扩大地方权利，以便在中央的集中领导下，充分发挥地方的积极性创造性，推进社会主义建设事业。但是关于改进食品工业的管理体制问题，除了要首先解决中央和地方的上下关系，扩大地方职权而外，还必须要解决目前食品工业存在着多头领导的问题，即有些食品工业中的一个行业分属于好几个部门领导，因而，妨碍了这些行业的全面规划和统一安排。建议一个行业原则上应归一个部门统一规划和管理，克服目前多头领导的弊端。
    最后，我要着重指出的，目前食品工业所存在的某些困难是发展中的困难，我坚决相信这些困难将会逐步得到解决。我国食品工业也将随着社会主义的建设和人民生活的不断提高而不断发展，宽阔的前途是展开在我们面前的。目前食品工业领导方面的缺点错误是不少的，希望听到各位代表的批评意见，以便我们努力改进。
