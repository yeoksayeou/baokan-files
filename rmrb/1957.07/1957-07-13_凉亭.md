	Pavilion
	Tie Qiao
	--Reading the news that many pavilions have been built in agricultural cooperatives in my hometown…
	
	At the foot of the mountain, beside the small river, there is a pavilion.
	The road stretches down from the mountain, passes through the pavilion, and extends towards the distant cedar forests and valleys.
	Members of the cooperative come from the fields, wade through the small river, step onto the stone steps by the river, and go into the pavilion. They eat there, light cigarettes, laugh and talk loudly, then lie down, covering their faces with palm-leaf hats, and take a nap.
	A young woodcutter runs down from the mountain, leans his load of firewood against the wall of the pavilion, supporting it with his carrying pole, and then goes into the pavilion to rest.
	Girls digging wild vegetables and gathering pigweed place their full baskets of flowers and vegetables on the long benches of the pavilion, and in twos and threes, play at tossing pebbles.
	A cadre going to the countryside walks to the river and scoops up a handful of clear water to wash his sweaty and dirty face. He sits on the long bench in the pavilion, takes off his shoes, and shakes out the sand and stones. He looks at the village of black tiles and white walls in the distance, touches the documents in his backpack, and then walks forward with confidence.
	A sudden clap of thunder and lightning signals that it is about to rain. Travelers gather from all directions towards the pavilion. After the arrow-like shower passes, they step onto the warm and damp bluestone path, facing the cool wind.
	The walls of the pavilion are half old and half new.
	The old walls bear old marks. There is a charcoal drawing of a "transformed" rat, its tail pointing in the direction the travelers are going. There is also a poem:
	"High mountains have good water, plains have good flowers, families have good daughters, but don't think about her without money."
	The word "莫" (mò, don't) has been painted over with yellow chalk and replaced with the word "要" (yào, want).
	There is also a faded slip of paper with the words:
	"Oh, august Heaven, oh, august Earth, my family has a crying child, may the passing gentleman recite this once, and he will sleep until dawn."
	Perhaps it was the same person who changed the poem who crossed out the word "睡" (shuì, sleep) with yellow chalk and added the word "哭" (kū, cry). Perhaps it was to express his satire of that pitiful person who sought help from illusions?
	The new walls have new posters. A notice from the Provincial Department of Agriculture about an agricultural exhibition. A bulletin from the County Committee introducing the experience of the Qingshanling Agricultural Production Cooperative in running the cooperative. An advertisement from the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative promoting new agricultural tools.
	On the top of the wall, there is also a line of square, large characters:
	"Built with funds raised by all members of the Qingshanling Agricultural Production Cooperative in the 'Start of Summer' of 1957."
	The font is immature, perhaps the work of that high school graduate. But the tone is bold and ambitious. It can be seen that this ordinary collective contains infinite potential, and the great achievements it will establish.

    凉亭
    铁桥
    ——读报载，家乡的农业社修建了许多凉亭……
    山脚下，小河旁，有一座凉亭。
    路从山上伸下来，穿过凉亭，向远方的杉林、峡谷伸展开去。
    合作社社员从田里过来，趟过小河，踏上河边的石级，走到凉亭里去。他们在那里吃饭，打火抽烟，大声谈笑，然后躺下来，用箬帽盖着脸，歇晌。
    斫柴的小郎倌，从山上飞跑下来，把柴担靠在凉亭的墙上，用担杖支着，然后走到凉亭里，坐下来休息。
    挖野菜的、打猪草的姑娘，把满筐的花、菜，放在凉亭的长凳上，三三两两，玩起了掷小石子。
    下乡的干部，走到河边，捧一掬清水洗净汗污的脸。坐到凉亭的长凳上，脱下鞋，抖落鞋里的砂石。望望远处一片黑瓦白墙的村落，摸摸背包里的文件，然后满怀信心地向前走去。
    一阵急电紧雷，要下雨了。行脚人从四面八方向凉亭集中。待急箭似的阵雨过后，才迎着清凉的风，踏上温湿的青石板路。
    凉亭的墙，一半是旧的，一半是新的。
    旧的墙上留下旧的痕迹。有木炭画的“化”字老鼠，尾巴翘向那面，表示行脚人去的方向。还有诗：
    “高山有好水，平地有好花，人家有好女，无钱莫想她。”
    “莫”字被人用黄色的化石涂去了，加上了个“要”字。
    还有一张颜色剥落的字条，上面写着：
    “天皇皇，地皇皇，我家有个哭儿郎，过往君子念一遍，一夜睡到大天亮。”
    也许还是那个改诗的人，用黄色化石把“睡”字划去了，加了个“哭”字。也许是表示他对那位乞助于虚妄的可怜人的讽刺吧？
    新的墙上有新的招贴。省农业厅举办农业展览会的布告。县委会介绍青山岭农业生产合作社办社经验的大字通报。县供销合作社推广新式农具的广告。
    墙头上还有一行方正的大字：
    “公元1957年立夏青山岭农业生产合作社全体社员集资修建。”
    字体是稚嫩的，也许还是那位高小毕业生的作品。但口气是豪迈的。可以看出这个普通的集体蕴藏着无穷的潜力，和它将要建立的伟大的功勋。
