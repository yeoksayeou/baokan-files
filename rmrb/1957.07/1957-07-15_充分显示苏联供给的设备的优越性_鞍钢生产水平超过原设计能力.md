Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 13th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Chen reports: Many factories and mines of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company built with Soviet assistance have seen their actual production levels surpass their original design capacities, fully demonstrating the superiority of the various metallurgical equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. In the first four and a half years of the First Five-Year Plan, Anshan Iron and Steel has completed, in whole or in large part, thirty-one major projects. The majority of these metallurgical factories and mines, designed with Soviet assistance and built with Soviet-supplied equipment, have seen their actual production levels exceed their original designed production capacities after being put into operation. The Dagushan Iron Mine, only completed last year, plans to produce 300,000 to 500,000 tons more iron ore than its original design capacity this year. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, currently our country's largest steelmaking plant, also went into operation last year, but according to this year's production plan, steel production will exceed the original design capacity by more than 200,000 tons.

The three famous projects of Anshan Iron and Steel—the Large Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace—were put into operation at the end of 1953. As a result of workers learning new Soviet technologies and tapping the potential of the equipment, the current actual production levels have greatly exceeded the original design capacities. According to this year's production plan, the seamless steel tubes produced by the Seamless Steel Tube Plant beyond the original design capacity are enough to equip more than 10,000 drilling rigs. The steel or heavy rails produced by the Large Rolling Mill beyond the original design capacity can be used to build more than twenty factories like the Large Rolling Mill or more than 3,000 kilometers of railways. The pig iron produced by No. 7 Blast Furnace beyond the original design capacity is enough to manufacture more than one million double-wheeled double-shared plows.

Through the hard work of steelworkers and their efforts to learn advanced Soviet experiences, the Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Sheet Mill, No. 5, 6, 7, and 9 Blast Furnaces, eight coke ovens, and some ore dressing and sintering plants, which have been put into operation in the past few years, have also exceeded their original design capacities in terms of actual production levels. Coupled with the potential of the original enterprises, Anshan Iron and Steel has now become a huge integrated metallurgical enterprise.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report on the First Five-Year Plan: After the reconstruction of Anshan Iron and Steel is completed by 1960, its production scale can be expanded to an annual output of 2.5 million tons of pig iron, 3.22 million tons of steel, and 2.48 million tons of steel products. However, Anshan Iron and Steel has not yet been fully reconstructed, and according to this year's production plan, the output of pig iron has already exceeded this level, and the output of steel and steel products has also approached this level.

### 充分显示苏联供给的设备的优越性  鞍钢生产水平超过原设计能力

    充分显示苏联供给的设备的优越性
    鞍钢生产水平超过原设计能力
    新华社鞍山13日电　新华社记者李沉报道：苏联帮助鞍山钢铁公司建设的许多厂矿，其实际生产水平都已超过原设计能力，充分显示了苏联供应的各种冶金设备的优越性。在第一个五年计划前四年半中，鞍钢已经有三十一项主要工程全部或大部建设完成。这些由苏联帮助设计，并且由苏联供给的设备建设起来的冶金工厂和矿山，其中的绝大多数在投入生产以后，实际生产水平超过了原定的设计生产能力。大孤山铁矿去年刚建设完成，今年计划生产的铁矿石就超过原设计能力三十万到五十万吨；目前我国最大的炼钢厂——鞍钢第二炼钢厂也是去年投入生产的，可是按照今年的生产计划，钢产量就比原设计能力多二十万吨以上。
    鞍钢著名的三大工程——大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和七号高炉，在1953年底投入生产后，经过职工们学习苏联的新技术，发挥设备潜力的结果，现在实际生产水平都大大超过了原设计能力。按照今年的生产计划，无缝钢管厂超过原设计能力所生产的无缝钢管，可以装备一万多台钻探机；大型轧钢厂超过原设计能力所生产的钢材或重轨，能多建设二十多座如同大型轧钢厂一样的厂房或三千多公里的铁路；七号高炉超过原设计能力所生产的生铁，足够制造一百多万台双轮双铧犁。
    经过钢铁工人们辛勤的劳动和努力学习苏联的先进经验，在过去几年中投入生产的鞍钢第二薄板厂，五、六、七、九号高炉，八座焦炉，一些选矿和烧结厂等，目前实际的生产水平也都超过了原来设计能力。加上发挥了原有企业的潜力，现在鞍钢已成为一个巨大的联合冶金企业了。
    李富春副总理在关于第一个五年计划的报告中说：鞍钢到1960年改建完成以后，它的生产规模可以扩大到年产生铁二百五十万吨，钢三百二十二万吨，钢材二百四十八万吨；可是鞍钢还没有改建完成，根据鞍钢今年的生产计划，生铁的产量已超过这一水平，钢和钢材的产量也已接近这一水平了。
