The Qilian Mountains Awaken

Ah, the Qilian Mountains, this mythical treasure trove, how enticing it is!

For many years, snow has covered the peaks of the Qilian Mountains, glaciers have buried the minerals of the Qilian Mountains, and endless treasures have slumbered underground, yet people have said that this place is infinitely desolate. Today, the roar of machines has broken the long silence of the Qilian Mountains. Under the peaks that reach into the clouds, the red flags of the exploration teams flutter. In the deep valleys, one can often see the tents and agile figures of geological personnel.

The Qilian Mountains, known as the Urals of China, are more than 1,200 kilometers long. According to the data from several years of field surveys, it has been confirmed that within an 850-kilometer zone from east to west, there are intermittent deposits of various metallic and non-metallic minerals such as iron, lead, zinc, gold, silver, oil, and coal. The geological exploration team working at the large-scale Jingtieshan Iron Mine are not afraid of the high mountains and deep valleys, nor are they afraid of the cold wind and heavy snow. They have erected drilling rigs on the steep cliffs and left glorious footprints on the muddy snow. In a year and a half, through drilling and peripheral reconnaissance, they finally found enough mineral deposits to establish a steel base. Photo by Sima (Contribution from Gansu Daily)

The dozens of drilling rigs that have started drilling here have been progressing well for a year and a half, and many advanced workers have emerged. Workers who have transferred from the military have also initially mastered drilling technology in half a year.

Exploration team members working at the Jingtieshan Iron Mine in the Qilian Mountains of Gansu Province climb to the peaks of mountains three to four thousand meters above sea level to conduct surface observations.

In the case of inconvenient transportation, it is especially important to strengthen the maintenance of the machines. These are technicians helping drillers with rod tamping.

Herdsmen of all ethnic groups actively support the Jingtieshan Geological Exploration Team. Camel teams transport equipment day and night. This is a camel team passing through Jiayuguan.

Drillers level the foundation on the steep cliffs, install drilling rigs, and conduct drilling.

The scope of activities of the Jingtieshan Geological Team is expanding day by day. Exploration team members have already conducted preliminary measurements of geological points under the Daxueshan, known as the "Ten Thousand Year Snow Mountain."

The Jingtieshan Meteorological Station has been established to provide weather forecasts for exploration work.

The mobile bookstore of Xinhua Bookstore also brought various books and magazines to Jingtieshan.

Road builders brave wind, snow and severe cold in the frozen winter and fight with hard rocks.

    祁连山苏醒了
    祁连山，这个神话般的宝库，是多么诱人啊！
    多少年来，积雪复盖着祁连山的顶峰，冰川淹埋着祁连山的矿藏，无穷无尽的宝藏沉睡在地下，但是人们却说这里无限荒凉。如今，机器的轰鸣声打破了祁连山长久的寂静，高入云际的顶峰下，飘起了勘探队的红旗，深谷里经常可以看到地质人员的帐篷和矫捷的身影。
    被誉为中国乌拉尔的祁连山，全长一千二百多公里。根据几年来实地勘察的资料证实，从东到西八百五十公里的地带内，断续有铁、铅、锌、黄金、白银、石油、煤等各种金属矿和非金属矿。工作在大型铁矿镜铁山的地质勘探队员，他们不怕山大沟深，不畏寒风大雪，在悬崖陡壁的山上架起了钻机，在泥泞雪地上留下了光荣的脚印。在一年半的时间里，经过钻探和外围普查，终于找到了足够建立一个钢铁基地的矿藏。司马摄（甘肃日报社稿）
    在这里开钻的数十部钻机，一年半以来钻进情况都良好，并涌现出不少先进工作者。从部队转业的工人，在半年的时间里，也都初步掌握了钻探技术。
    在甘肃省祁连山大型铁矿镜铁山工作的勘探队员，攀越拔海三、四千公尺高的山顶上，进行地表观察。
    在交通不便的情况下，加强机器的维护保养尤其重要。这是技术员们帮助钻工进行捣杆。
    各族牧民积极支援镜铁山地质勘探队，一支一支的骆驼队日夜不停地运输器材。这是途经嘉峪关的骆驼队。
    钻探工人们在陡壁上平整地基，安装起钻机，进行钻探。
    镜铁山地质队活动的范围日益扩大，勘探队员们已在被称做“万年雪”的大雪山下进行地质点的初步测定。
    镜铁山的气象站已经建立起来，为勘探工作提供气象预报。
    新华书店的流动书摊也带着各种书籍、杂志来到了镜铁山。
    筑路工人在冰封雪冻的冬天里，冒着风雪严寒，和坚硬的岩石战斗。
