Visiting Relatives

　　Nada Town in Hainan Island is an old revolutionary base area where the Qiongya Detachment persisted in revolutionary struggle in those years. During the long period of revolutionary struggle, the fighters of the Qiongya Detachment shared life and death and went through all kinds of hardships together with the local people. The army and the people were as united as milk and water.

　　Major General Ma Baishan, the current Deputy Commander of the Hainan Military Region, was the detachment leader of the Qiongya Detachment and the Deputy Commander of the Qiongya Detachment who led the people's struggle in the Mupai area in those years. General Ma Baishan is a familiar name to the people of Hainan Island, just like a member of their own family. When General Ma Baishan and his troops persisted in fighting in the mountains, the people delivered food to the troops through layers of enemy blockades. A fellow villager would rather slaughter his own cattle and send the meat to the troops. Once, General Ma Baishan was wounded in his left arm and was hidden in the homes of the masses and recovered under the enthusiastic care and treatment of the masses. The enthusiastic support of the people for the revolutionary troops is deeply engraved in General Ma Baishan's heart. General Ma Baishan often said to his comrades: "We must not forget the deep feelings we established with the people in the difficult times!" Recently, General Ma Baishan took time to return to Mupai Town to visit his relatives.

　　Seventeen years ago, General Ma Baishan was wounded in battle and was healed by Mom Fu and several elderly people with enthusiastic care.

　　The place where the battle used to be has now become a rubber plantation.

　　"In the past, in the hard years, we ate wild vegetables and persisted in the revolutionary struggle. What is the hardship in the future!" said the general.

    探亲
    海南岛那大县木排镇，是当年琼崖纵队坚持革命斗争的一个老根据地。在长时期的革命斗争中，琼崖纵队的战士们和当地人民同生死共患难，共同经历了千辛万苦的困难。军队和人民团结得像水乳交溶一般。
    现任海南军区副司令员的马白山少将，就是当年在木排地区领导人民斗争的琼崖纵队支队长和琼崖纵队的副司令员。马白山将军，这是海南岛人民群众很熟悉的名字，正如同家里人一般。当马白山将军和部队在山上坚持斗争的时候，人民群众就透过敌人的层层封锁给部队送来了粮食。一位老乡宁肯把自己的耕牛杀了，也要把肉送给部队。有一次，马白山将军左臂负了伤，就是在群众的家里隐蔽，并在群众的热心看护和治疗下才痊愈的。人民群众对革命部队的热情支援，深深地铭刻在马白山将军的心中。马白山将军常对他的战友们说：“在艰苦的时代里我们和人民群众建立起来的深厚感情，可不能把它忘记呀！”最近，马白山将军抽空回到木排镇，探望亲人去了。

    十七年前，马白山将军在战斗中负伤，就是符妈妈和几位老人热心护理才治好的。
    过去战斗的地方，现在已变成了橡胶园。
    “过去在艰苦的岁月里，吃着野菜，我们都把革命斗争坚持下来了，往后的艰苦又算得了什么呢！”将军说。
