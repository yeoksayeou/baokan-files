    Can Only Advance, Cannot Retreat!
    Fei Guangtai and Zhang Zifu said in a joint speech: The right-wingers want the people to be exploited and enslaved again. We coal mine workers will absolutely not allow it and will fight them to the end!
    In particular, after studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and hearing Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," we received profound education, raised our political consciousness, and further understood the great achievements of our country under the leadership of the Party in the Three Great Transformations and the Five Great Movements and socialist construction. We looked forward to a bright future and felt greatly encouraged and extremely excited, so we expressed our firm support for these two reports. Moreover, we will certainly continue to work hard in our positions according to the instructions of these two reports. We fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and others at this meeting.
    The reactionary remarks made by right-wingers such as Chu Anping, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Ge Peiqi, etc., are baseless and absurd. They stubbornly seek out individual shortcomings and mistakes in the revolutionary movement to negate the great achievements of the revolution. They say they do not want the leadership of the Party, they oppose socialist transformation and socialist construction, they oppose the people's democratic dictatorship and democratic centralism, they hate the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the unity of peace-loving people all over the world. They want the people to be exploited and enslaved again, and they want to drag China back to the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. That is a fantasy and absolutely cannot be allowed. We coal mine workers, along with the people of the whole country, firmly disapprove of it and will fight them to the end!
    We two are coal mine workers in Fushun. Now, we will use the achievements we have seen with our own eyes and the facts we have personally experienced to explain the development of Chinese coal mines in recent years under the leadership of the Party, and briefly report to the conference as follows:
    We conducted two inspections last winter and this spring, visiting a total of four mining bureaus and three factories. The products of these three factories play an important role in fire extinguishing, cooling, and gas detection in coal mines. Due to time constraints, we will not discuss the situation of these three factories for the time being, but will focus on the four mining bureaus, including Pingxiang in Jiangxi, Huainan in Anhui, Zibo in Shandong, and Fushun in Liaoning. Our inspections focused on production, increased production and conservation, safety and labor protection, and existing problems. These two inspections were a very good practical study for coal mine workers. Because the time was short, we were unable to see everything comprehensively, so the content of this report may be very one-sided. Please give us your criticism and correction, fellow delegates and attendees.
    Coal Mine Production Situation
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, coal mine workers across the country, with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity, and coal production rose rapidly, and labor productivity also increased significantly. For example, in the four mines under the Pingxiang Mining Bureau, namely Gaokeng, Anyuan, Qingshan, and Wangjiayuan, the total raw coal production of the entire bureau in 1949 at the time of liberation was 83,000 tons, and the average labor productivity was 0.066 tons; this year's planned raw coal production is 1.77 million tons, which is 21.5 times that of 1949, and the average labor productivity is 1.014 tons, which is 15.5 times that of 1949. In the eight coal mines under the Huainan Mining Bureau, namely Jiulonggang Mine, Datong Mine, Xinzhuangzi Mine, Xieyi Mine, Xieer Mine, Xiesan Mine, Liyingziyi Mine, and Liyingzier Mine, the total raw coal production of the entire bureau in 1949 at the time of liberation was 1,125,113 tons, and the average labor productivity was 0.268 tons; this year's planned raw coal production is 4.5 million tons, which is four times that of 1949, and the average labor productivity is 1.077 tons, which is four times that of 1949. In the eight coal mines under the Zibo Mining Bureau, namely Hongshan, Zhai Li, Kuishan, Xiazhuang, Shuangshan, Xinbo, Xihe, and Heishan, the total raw coal production of the entire bureau in 1949 at the time of liberation was 1,023,848 tons, and the average labor productivity was 0.322 tons; this year's planned raw coal production is 3.63 million tons, which is 3.5 times that of 1949, and the average labor productivity is 0.759 tons, which is 2.4 times that of 1949. In the four mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau, namely Open-pit, Shengli, Laohutai, and Longfeng, the total raw coal production of the entire bureau in 1949 was 2.05 million tons, and the average labor productivity was 0.348 tons; this year's planned raw coal production is 8.6 million tons, which is 4.15 times that of 1949, and the average labor productivity is 1.19 tons, which is 3.4 times that of 1949. According to the existing equipment, labor organization, working face arrangement, and technical management of the above four mining bureaus (except for some problems with insufficient material supply), there is no problem in completing the tasks assigned by the state in the first five-year plan. At the same time, it can also be explained that the production targets set by the state are relatively correct and feasible.
    Coal Mine Increased Production and Conservation Situation
    After the state put forward the call for increased production and conservation this year, all the workers in all the mines responded enthusiastically and unanimously supported it, which played a very good role among the broad masses of workers. For example, in terms of increased production, each mine, according to its own different conditions, mobilized favorable factors and tapped potential forces, and put forward increased production plans to varying degrees on the basis of the original production plans. According to the inspected mines, generally speaking, they all put forward increased production plans of 1% to 5%, and some individually reached 10%. On the whole, it is certain that the planned coal production this year can be overfulfilled. In terms of conservation, each mine, through mass discussions and using the method of detailed accounting, formulated very detailed conservation plans. For the technical management part, plans were made for fire extinguishing, water prevention, roof management, electromechanical maintenance, improving coal mining recovery rate, giving play to equipment utilization rate, and eliminating invalid footage. For the material consumption part, plans were made to reduce the consumption quotas of different varieties of raw materials such as pit wood, coal, detonators, and electricity. Each plan has specific measures to ensure its realization, and each measure has detailed explanations. Some, according to specific requirements and achievable results, calculate the economic value and include it in the cost reduction and profit delivery plan. Therefore, it shows that this movement of increased production and conservation, in addition to the direct increase in output, may accumulate a lot of funds for the state in saving raw materials, which will help the implementation of the basic construction plan. From this, it can be seen that the call for increased production and conservation is very wise and very correct.
    Comparison of China's Coal Production with the World Level
    The raw coal production of China's first five-year plan was 112.99 million tons, the second five-year plan was 210 million tons, and the preliminary third five-year plan was tentatively set at 406 million tons. If we estimate the national raw coal production based on the actual situation of the inspected mines this year, then the 1957 target of the first five-year plan can not only be successfully completed but also overfulfilled, because the planned task assigned by the state this year is 117.27 million tons, which is already 4.28 million tons more than the target of the first five-year plan. Now, the overfulfilled plans made by each mine are actually overfulfilled on the basis of this overfulfilled target. According to our preliminary estimate, it should not be a big problem to complete 120 million tons this year.
    According to the 1955 world statistics, the world's population was 2,528.3 million, and the coal production in the same year was about 2 billion tons. Calculated by the world's population on average, each person produces about 0.8 tons of coal per year, which is the international coal production level of about 0.8 tons. If China is estimated according to a population of 600 million, it must produce 480 million tons of coal per year to reach the world level.
    If China's second and third five-year plans can be completed smoothly, then it can produce 406 million tons of coal in 1967. If it can be overfulfilled by 20%, then it can produce 487.2 million tons of coal in 1967, which may approach the world level, or may reach the world level. We know that according to the 1955 world statistics, looking at countries as units, the United States ranks first in coal production, and the Soviet Union ranks second. But if we look at the national economy, the most advanced country in the world is Czechoslovakia, not the United States. The United States produces 448.79 million tons of coal, with a population of 165.25 million, and produces an average of 2.7 tons of coal per person; Czechoslovakia produces 60 million tons of coal, with a population of 13.16 million, and produces an average of 4.6 tons of coal per person, exceeding the United States by 70%. Therefore, from the perspective of the coal-producing national economy, the most advanced country in the world should be Czechoslovakia. Coal mine workers! If you want to reach the world's advanced level in coal production, you should continue to make the greatest efforts and learn from Czechoslovakia!
    Coal Mine Safety Situation
    In the past few years after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, major personal accidents in coal mines have been greatly reduced compared with before, but phenomena such as roof fall, water inrush, gas, and spontaneous combustion are still constantly threatening production. Moreover, due to unskilled operation and low technical management level, and many coal mines are gradually trying to become mechanized as much as possible, general accidents in transportation, machinery, and electricity have increased instead, which is not in line with our country's call for the "safe production" policy.
    It is recommended that each mine, each mining bureau, and each coal mine management bureau should, in view of the weaknesses existing in their own unit, organize various different safety groups to thoroughly study and solve the key problems existing in safety. At the same time, it is recommended that the Coal Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences strengthen contact with the Ministry of Coal Industry to lead the three coal research institutes and the safety research groups of each mine to cooperate well in the division of labor to solve the major and urgent safety problems of each mine. Even if it does not directly increase output, it is an invisible great saving and should not be regarded as a waste.
    According to our inspection of the four mining bureaus, generally speaking, the safety situation is not very good. Only the Xiejiayi Mine under the Huainan Mining Bureau has not had any fatal accidents in the past three years, and the Xinbo Mine under the Zibo Mining Bureau has not had any fatal accidents in the past five years, and they are continuing to maintain this glorious achievement. According to our understanding, these two typical mines can be regarded as being within the advanced safety experience in Chinese coal mines. Their ability to achieve this experience is definitely not a simple task. It is certain that they have a very complete set of methods in mine leadership, technical management, practical operation, regulations and systems, the study, implementation, and execution of labor discipline, and other aspects. They should be summarized in detail from top to bottom, printed into booklets, and promoted nationwide. If it can play a role in eliminating or reducing fatal accidents, that value is incalculable.
    Several Issues
    The problem that the reasonable production of oil shale and the amount of oil shale required by the oil refinery do not match. The four coal mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau, one of which is the West Open-pit Coal Mine, have two products, one is coal and the other is oil shale. Coal is a national product, while oil shale is not a national product, but a raw material for artificial petroleum processing. In order to complete the raw coal required by the state, the Fushun Mining Bureau carried out an overall reconstruction and entrusted it to Soviet design. This foreign design was proposed at the end of 1955, and now it is being constructed according to the design, and it is planned to be completed in stages. The reconstruction of the West Open-pit Mine is also one part of it. However, according to the foreign design, after the reconstruction, the raw coal production may meet the requirements of the state, but the amount of oil shale produced reasonably cannot meet the requirements of the existing equipment of the artificial petroleum factory. However, the oil refinery is still constantly expanding, whether it is reconstruction or new construction, it is much simpler than the construction of the coal mine, and it can be put into production in a very short time. Once put into production, it will ask the coal mine for oil shale, and the coal mine has no preparation for this. It is forced to mine and excavate indiscriminately, violating technical policies and causing adverse consequences. This is a contradiction between current interests and long-term interests, which has not been resolved. It is recommended that the central government study and solve this problem.
    Whether oil shale is a national product. According to the document recorded at the meeting of the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee of People's Democratic Countries held in Warsaw on March 28, 1957: There are nine types of standard fuel resources in the Soviet Union, and the third type is oil shale, with a production of 11.75 million tons in 1957. The West Open-pit Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau plans to produce 15.2 million tons of oil shale in 1957, which is more than the Soviet Union in terms of quantity. However, our country does not attach as much importance to this kind of oil shale fuel resource as the Soviet Union. It neither grasps the production figures of oil shale nor includes oil shale in the national product, but the oil tasks assigned every year are always increasing, but it does not care much about the raw materials for oil production, thus causing constant disputes between factories and mines, such as quantity problems, quality problems, transportation problems, maintenance problems, unit price problems, and various problems of tonnage increase and decrease. They are constantly negotiating, and often fail to reach an agreement. If oil shale can be included in the national product plan indicators (treated the same as cotton and soybeans), then factories and mines will have their own goals to strive for, and the state can grasp it and know what to do. The above-mentioned disputes may be reduced a lot. It is recommended that the central government study and determine this issue.
    Before 1952, during the period when the oil refinery was also under the leadership of the mining bureau, the price of oil shale or whether to give the price was not a big problem, because the mining bureau settled a general account at the end of the year. Since the oil refinery and the mining bureau separated in 1953, this problem has become more obvious, but it is still under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and the Ministry can still handle it. In 1955, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Petroleum were separated into two ministries, and the problem of oil shale pricing became more prominent, and the Ministry of Coal Industry could not solve it.
    According to the statistics in 1956, the Fushun Mining Bureau has two products, raw coal and oil shale. The average profit per person per year is 1,476 yuan, while the Petroleum No. 1 Factory only processes oil shale, and the average profit per person per year is 4,387 yuan; the enterprise bonus obtained by the mining bureau accounts for 10.95% of the total wages of production workers, while the enterprise bonus obtained by the Petroleum No. 1 Factory accounts for 33.94% of the total wages of production workers; therefore, based on the growth of labor productivity, the average wage increase of the mining bureau is 28%, while the average wage increase of the Petroleum No. 1 Factory is 32.1%. This problem directly affects the unreasonable life of workers. According to foreign design, according to the production of two beneficial minerals, the cost of oil shale should be 2.41 yuan per ton, plus taxes, profit money, etc., the selling price should be 3.44 yuan. The Economic Commission approved this algorithm in September 1956, but the two ministries have not reached an agreement until now. The actual price per ton is now 1.5 yuan, which is 0.91 yuan less than the cost. According to this year's oil shale production, it will lose more than 10 million yuan. If oil shale production is further promoted, the profits of the oil refinery will be able to increase accordingly, but on the contrary, the coal mine will lose even more. It seems that the price of oil shale is not fair and reasonable, and the cost of oil is not real enough. The workers of the oil refinery do not cherish raw materials and do not improve technology, precisely because they have obtained unreasonable excessive profits, which have fostered the arrogance and complacency of the workers, and thus are not united with the coal mine workers. From the perspective of the overall national interest, the fairness of distribution is not very important, and the country's income is always the same, but the contradiction between the coal mine and the oil refinery is getting bigger and bigger. This is a contradiction between individual interests and overall interests, and it is recommended that the central government study and solve it.
    Fushun city's electric railway transportation problem. There is a transportation department organization under the leadership of the Fushun Mining Bureau. In addition to being responsible for the transportation tasks of various factories and mines in the coal industry department system, the department has also been undertaking the transportation tasks of various state-owned enterprises and local state-owned enterprises in the Fushun area for a long time. The state-owned factories in the Fushun area belong to the central vertical system, including seven ministries: petroleum, electricity, construction, smelting, chemical industry, commerce, first machinery, and second machinery. In the foreign design of the overall reconstruction of the Fushun coalfield, some overall arrangements were made for the city's ground transportation according to the situation in 1953, but it did not include the development of the region. Now, the Petroleum No. 2 Factory, the Petroleum No. 3 Factory, the Electric Porcelain Factory, etc., have already begun to expand, and the Coal Oil Refinery, the Petroleum Prefabricated Parts Factory, etc., will soon be newly built. They only know how to expand and newly build, they do not consider how to transport, nor do they include transportation investment in the plan. They drag on and on and want the transportation department to undertake it. Everyone knows that from December 1956 to January 1957, as much as 380,000 tons of coal could not be transported out of Fushun. This shows that the Fushun Bureau is unable to take care of itself, so how can it request a large amount of investment to undertake these additional transportation tasks? The Fushun Mining Bureau has taken the initiative to negotiate transportation investment matters with them, but until now it has not been able to obtain a unified, affirmative final solution. It is recommended that the central government convene relevant ministries to study and solve this transportation investment problem.
    The above are all the problems that exist in the inspection, and also the contradictions between the units below. Although they have been negotiated, they cannot be resolved. The reason is that the units below look at problems from the perspective of each unit. They always insist on their own opinions on issues that are considered reasonable, developmental, and economically accountable within their own unit, and they do not give in to each other, so it is difficult to unify, and therefore it cannot be resolved. But it is not the same at the central level. The central government looks at problems as a whole, starts from a national point of view, development is comprehensive, there are reasons for priority and urgency, considering the current plan and also combining long-term planning, considering current interests and also combining long-term interests, and economic accounting is calculating a large account. Therefore, due to various relationships, it is recommended that the central government, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People," the above problems can be gradually resolved.

    Best wishes for the success of the conference!

专栏：

    只能前进，不能倒退！
    费广泰、张子富在联合发言中说：右派分子想让人民再受剥削，再受奴役，我们煤矿职工绝对不允许，一定要同他们斗争到底！
    特别是我们学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，又听到了周恩来总理“政府工作报告”，使我们受到深刻教育，提高政治觉悟，又进一步了解了我国在党的领导下取得了三大改造和五大运动的胜利和社会主义建设的伟大成就，展望了美好远景，感到了很大的鼓舞和无比的兴奋，所以我们表示坚决拥护这两个报告。而且一定根据这两个报告的指示，在工作岗位上，继续努力前进。我们完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长等在这次会议上所作的报告。
    右派分子如储安平、章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、葛佩琦等所发表的反动言论，毫无根据，荒谬绝伦，硬找革命运动中的个别部分的缺点和错误来否定革命的伟大成绩。他们说不要党的领导，他们反对社会主义改造和社会主义建设，他们反对人民民主专政和民主集中制，他们仇恨全国各族人民大团结和全世界爱好和平人民的团结，他们想让人民再受剥削，再受奴役，想把中国拉回到半封建半殖民地的旧社会里去。那是幻想，绝对不能容许的，我们煤矿职工也和全国人民一道坚决不认可的，一定要和他们斗争到底！
    我们两个人都是在抚顺的煤矿工作者，现在用亲眼所看到的成绩和亲身所体验的事实来说明在党的领导下，几年来中国煤矿发展的情况，简单的向大会汇报如下：
    我们在去年冬季和今年春季进行过两次视察，共计到过四个矿务局和三个工厂。这三个工厂的产品对于煤矿中的消火、降温和瓦斯检定等起着重要作用，因为时间的关系，这三个工厂的情况就暂不谈了，着重要谈一谈这四个矿务局，包括江西的萍乡，安徽的淮南，山东的淄博和辽宁的抚顺。我们视察重点是放在生产情况，增产节约情况，安全及劳动保护情况和存在问题等方面。经过这两次视察，对于煤矿工作者来讲是一个很好的实际学习，因为时间较短，未能全面看过，因而所汇报的内容，可能片面性很大，请各位代表和列席同志们多加指正。
    煤矿生产情况
    解放后全国煤矿职工在党及政府的领导下，以主人翁的态度，发挥了积极性和创造性，煤炭产量迅速上升，劳动生产率也显著提高。如萍乡矿务局所属高坑、安源、青山及王家源等四个矿，解放当时，一九四九年全局全年原煤产量为八万三千吨，劳动生产率平均为零点零六六吨；今年原煤计划产量为一百七十七万吨，是一九四九年的二十一点五倍，劳动生产率平均为一点零一四吨，是一九四九年的十五点五倍。淮南矿务局所属的九龙岗矿、大通矿、新庄孜矿、谢一矿、谢二矿、谢三矿、李郢孜一矿及李郢孜二矿等八个煤矿，在解放当时一九四九年，全局全年原煤产量为一百一十二万五千一百一十三吨，劳动生产率平均为零点二六八吨；今年原煤计划产量为四百五十万吨，是一九四九年的四倍，劳动生产率平均为一点零七七吨，是一九四九年的四倍。淄博矿务局所属的洪山、寨里、奎山、夏庄、双山、新博、西河、黑山等八个煤矿，在解放当时一九四九年，全局全年原煤产量为一百零二万三千八百四十八吨，劳动生产率平均为零点三二二吨；今年原煤计划产量为三百六十三万吨，是一九四九年的三点五倍，劳动生产率平均为零点七五九吨，是一九四九年的二点四倍。抚顺矿务局所属的露天、胜利、老虎台、龙凤等四个矿，在一九四九年全局全年原煤产量为二百零五万吨，劳动生产率平均为零点三四八吨，今年原煤计划产量为八百六十万吨，是一九四九年的四点一五倍，劳动生产率平均为一点一九吨，是一九四九年的三点四倍。按照以上四个矿务局的现有设备，劳动组织，工作面的排列以及技术管理等等条件来看（除部分材料供应少有问题外）完成第一个五年计划国家所给的任务是没有问题的，同时也可以说明，国家所规定的生产指标，也是比较正确和切实可行的。
    煤矿增产节约情况
    今年国家提出增产节约号召以后，所有各矿的全体职工都热烈的响应，一致拥护，在广大职工群众中，起到了很好的作用。如在增产方面来讲，各矿根据自己不同的条件，调动有利因素，发掘潜在力量，均在原有的生产计划基础上，提出多少不同程度的增产计划。按照视察的各矿来看，一般的都提出百分之一到百分之五，个别的有提到百分之十的增产计划，总的来看，今年煤炭的计划产量，可以超额完成是应该肯定的。在节约方面来讲，各矿都通过群众讨论，用算细账的方法，制定出很详细的节约计划，对于技术管理部分，制出消火、防水、顶板管理，机电检修，提高采煤回收率，发挥设备利用率，消灭无效进尺等等计划，对于材料消耗部分，制出坑木、煤、雷管、电力等等不同品种的原材料消耗定额降低的计划。每个计划都有具体措施来保证它实现，每个措施都有详细说明，有的根据具体要求和能达到的效果，算出经济价值，列入降低成本和上缴利润计划里去。因此说明，增产节约这一运动，除去直接产量增加外，在节省原材料上，可能为国家积累不少资金，有助于基本建设计划的执行。由此可见，增产节约这个号召是非常英明非常正确的。
    我国煤炭产量与世界水平的比较
    我国第一个五年计划的原煤产量为一亿一千二百九十九万吨，第二个五年计划为二亿一千万吨，初步暂订第三个五年计划为四亿零六百万吨。如果按照今年视察各矿的实际情况为基础对于全国原煤产量而估计之，则第一个五年计划的一九五七年指标，不但可以胜利完成而且还可以超额完成，因为今年国家所布置的计划任务是一亿一千七百二十七万吨，已经比第一个五年计划的指标超额四百二十八万吨。现在各矿所订的超额计划，实际是在这个超额指标的基础上而又超额了，据我们初步的估计，今年完成一亿二千万吨，应该问题不大的。
    根据一九五五年世界统计资料来看，全世界人口为二十五亿二千八百三十万人，同年煤的产量约为二十亿吨，按全世界人口平均计算之，每人每年产煤约为零点八吨，也就是国际产煤水平约为零点八吨。我国如按六亿人口估计之，每年产煤四亿八千万吨，才能达到世界水平。
    我国的第二、第三两个五年计划如果都能顺利完成时，则一九六七年可以产煤四亿零六百万吨，若能超额百分之二十完成时，则一九六七年可以产煤四亿八千七百二十万吨，那就可能接近世界水平，也可能达到世界水平。我们知道，根据一九五五年世界统计资料，拿国家为单位来看，煤的产量，美国占第一位，苏联占第二位。但是若拿国民经济来看，世界最先进的国家是捷克斯洛伐克而不是美国，美国产煤四亿四千八百七十九万吨，人口是一亿六千五百二十五万人，每人平均产煤二点七吨；捷克斯洛伐克产煤六千万吨，人口是一千三百一十六万人，每人平均产煤四点六吨，超过美国百分之七十，所以说从产煤的国民经济来看，世界最先进的国家应该是捷克斯洛伐克。煤矿工作者们！煤的产量，想要达到世界先进水平的话，应该继续不断的作最大的努力，向捷克斯洛伐克学习！
    煤矿安全情况
    解放后几年来在党的正确领导下，煤矿的重大人身事故，比较以前是大大减少了，但是冒顶、透水、瓦斯以及自然发火等等现象，仍在不断的威胁着生产。又由于操作不熟练，技术管理水平较低，而许多煤矿都逐步尽可能走上机械化后，所以运输，机械，电气等方面的一般事故，反而增加了，这与我们国家所号召的“安全生产”方针是不太适应的。
    建议各矿、各矿务局、各煤矿管理局应当针对在本单位范围内所存在的弱点，组织各项不同的安全小组，来彻底研究解决在安全方面所存在的关键性问题，同时建议中国科学院煤炭研究室与煤炭工业部加强联系，来领导三个煤炭研究院和各矿的安全研究组，很好的分工合作，来解决各矿在安全上的重大而迫切的问题，纵然不直接增加产量但却是无形的极大节约，决不可以看作是浪费。
    根据我们视察的四个矿务局来看，总的来讲，安全情况都不太好，只有淮南矿务局所属的谢家集一矿，三年来未发生死亡事故，淄博矿务局所属的新博矿，五年来未发生死亡事故，并且还在继续保持这种光荣成绩。这两个典型矿，据我们了解，在我国煤矿之中，可以属于安全先进经验之内的。他们能够取得这样经验，决不是一件简单工作，肯定的说，他们在矿的领导上，技术管理上，实际操作上，规程制度，劳动纪律的学习、贯彻、执行上，以及其他方面，一定都有一套很完整的办法，应该由上而下，详细的总结，印成小册子，推广全国。如能起到消灭或者减少死亡事故的作用，那个价值是不可计算的。
    几个问题
    煤矿发展合理生产的油页岩量和油厂所需要的油页岩量不相配合的问题。抚顺矿务局所属四个煤矿，其中有个西露天煤矿共有两种产品，一种是煤，一种是油页岩。煤是国家产品，油页岩不算国家产品，而是人造石油加工用的原料。抚顺矿务局为了完成国家要求的原煤起见，进行了总体改建，委托苏联设计。这个国外设计是在一九五五年底提出来的，现在按照设计施工，计划分期完成，西露天矿的改建，也是其中之一部分。但根据国外设计来看，改建后，原煤产量可能满足国家要求，而合理生产出来的油页岩量，不能满足人造石油工厂已有设备的要求，可是油厂还在不断的扩大，无论是改建，新建，都比煤矿的建设简单的多，很短时间就可以投入生产，投入生产就向煤矿要油页岩，煤矿并无这项准备，被迫无奈，乱采乱掘，违反技术政策，造成不良后果。这是一个当前利益与长远利益的矛盾问题，始终未得到解决，建议中央要研究解决这个问题。
    油页岩算不算国家产品问题，根据一九五七年三月二十八日，人民民主国家经济互助委员会在华沙召开的文件里记载：苏联标准燃料资源共有九种，第三种就是油页岩，一九五七年生产一千一百七十五万吨，而抚顺矿务局的西露天矿，一九五七年生产油页岩计划一千五百二十万吨，按照数量比苏联还多。而我们国家对于这种油页岩的燃料资源并不像苏联那样重视，既不掌握油页岩的生产数字，也不把油页岩列入国家产品，但是每年布置油的任务总是增长的，至于制油的原料则不甚过问，因而造成厂、矿之间经常扯皮不休，如数量问题，质量问题，运输问题，检修问题，单价问题以及掉吨涨吨种种问题，经常不断协商，经常也达不成协议。如能将油页岩列入国家产品计划指标之内（与棉花、大豆同样看待），则厂、矿各有奋斗目标，国家掌握也能心中有数，上记扯皮问题，可能减少很多，建议中央研究确定这个问题。
    一九五二年以前，在油厂也归矿务局领导的期间内，油页岩给价多少或者给价与否，问题都不太大，原因是矿务局年终算一笔总账的关系。自一九五三年油厂和矿务局分家以后，这个问题就比较明显了，可是仍在燃料工业部的统一领导下，部内尚可以处理。一九五五年煤炭部和石油部又分开为两个部，则油页岩给价的问题，显得更突出了，而煤炭部也不能解决了。
    根据一九五六年统计数字来看，抚顺矿务局有原煤和油页岩两种产品，每年每人平均利润为一千四百七十六元，而石油一厂只为油页岩加工，每年每人平均利润为四千三百八十七元；矿务局得到的企业奖励金，占生产工人工资总额的百分之十点九五，而石油一厂得到的企业奖励金，占生产工人工资总额的百分之三十三点九四；因此以劳动生产率增长为基础而计算之，则矿务局的平均工资提高为百分之二十八，而石油一厂平均工资提高为百分之三十二点一，这个问题，对于职工生活，直接受到不合理的影响。又据国外设计，按照生产两种有益矿物，计算油页岩的成本，每吨应为二元四角一分，加上税金，利润金等，售价应为三元四角四分，这个算法，经委于一九五六年九月批复同意，但两个部一协商，直到现在也没有达成协议。现在实际每吨给价为一元五角，比较成本尚少九角一分，按照今年油页岩产量计算之，就要赔一千多万元，如果再提倡油页岩增产，则油厂得的利润当能随之而增加，可是相反的，煤矿赔得就更多了。似此油页岩的给价不够公平合理，造成油的成本也不够真实，油厂工人不爱惜原料，不提高技术，正因为取得不合理的过分利润，养成了职工骄傲自满情绪，因而与煤矿职工互不团结，对于整个国家利益来看，分配的合理与否关系不大，国家的收入总是一样的，但是煤矿与油厂之间的矛盾，可就越来越大了。这是一个个体利益与整体利益的矛盾，建议中央研究解决之。
    抚顺全市电铁运输问题。抚顺矿务局的领导下有一个运输部的组织，该部除负责煤炭工业部系统的各厂矿的运输任务外，由来已久，还承担着抚顺地区各国营企业和地方国营企业的运输任务。在抚顺地区的国营工厂属于中央垂直系统的有石油、电力、建筑、冶炼、化学、商业、一机械、二机械等七个部。在抚顺煤田总体改建国外设计中，对于全市性的地面运输，按照一九五三年的情况总的作了一些安排，但没有包括地区的发展情况，现在石油二厂、石油三厂、电瓷厂等，有的已经开始扩建，煤炼油厂、石油预制配件厂等，不久即将新建，他们只知道扩建，新建，他们并不考虑运输怎办，也不把运输投资列入计划之内，拖来拖去要令运输部来承担，殊不知由一九五六年十二月至一九五七年一月间，抚矿煤炭运不出去的就达到三十八万吨之多，此可见，抚顺局自顾不暇，那能请求大批投资承担这些额外运输任务呢？抚顺矿务局曾主动的和他们协商运输投资的事项，但是直到现在也得不到统一的肯定性的最后解决，建议中央召集有关各部研究解决这个运输投资的问题。
    以上，都是在视察中所存在的问题，也是在下边各单位彼此之间的矛盾，虽然经过协商，也得不到解决的。原因是下边各单位看问题，都是从各单位的角度出发，在本单位内认为是合理的、发展的而又经济核算的问题，总要坚持己见，互不让步，很难统一，所以也就得不到解决。但到中央则不然，中央看问题是整体的，从全国观点出发，发展是全面的，轻重缓急各有理由，考虑当前计划也结合远景规划，考虑当前利益也结合长远利益，经济核算是算一笔大账，因此种种关系，建议中央根据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，上记问题是可以逐步获得解决的。
    我们的发言，有不当之处，请各位代表、列席同志们予以批评和指正。
    敬祝大会胜利成功！
