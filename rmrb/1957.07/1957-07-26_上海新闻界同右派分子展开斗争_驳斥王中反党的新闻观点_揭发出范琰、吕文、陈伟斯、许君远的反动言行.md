Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: At the fourth meeting of the Shanghai journalism workers' symposium held on the 24th, the bourgeois news views of Wang Zhong, director of the Journalism Department of Fudan University, were severely criticized.

Wang Zhong is a Communist Party member, but he launched a series of attacks on the fundamental principles of the Party's news undertaking, attempting to replace proletarian news theory with bourgeois news theory.

According to the materials distributed at the symposium and the revelations of those present, Wang Zhong attempted to deny the Party spirit and class nature of newspapers. In his "Outline of Principles of Journalism," he said: "My basic argument is that the news undertaking is the product of the needs of the people in politics, economy, and culture as society develops to a certain historical stage. It cannot be said that newspapers are the product of class struggle." Therefore, he believes that the newspapers of all political parties have a dual nature: first, they are commodities, and second, they are propaganda tools of political parties.

Starting from this basic theory, he vigorously advocated so-called "serving the readers," not emphasizing guidance, but emphasizing interest, and so on.

Zheng Shifeng, deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily), said: When Wang Zhong talked about issues such as newspapers being tools of class struggle, ideological nature, and guidance, he used all kinds of vicious words. He even said that when talking about class struggle, people's defecation could also be linked to it, because after people defecate, they eat more food, become healthier, and can go to kill the enemy and fight.

Zheng Shifeng also revealed: Based on the theory that "man bites dog is news," Wang Zhong believed that a news item published by the Xinhua Daily reporting that 96% of agricultural cooperatives increased their income after collectivization was something everyone knew and not news, while the 4% that decreased their income was news. This means that if achievements are the main thing, there is no need to publicize them; to write news, one must look for shortcomings. This kind of argument is very strange and completely the same as the argument of the Rightists.

Zhao Guixiang and other fourth-year students of the Journalism Department of Fudan University accused Wang Zhong of poisoning them. Zhao Guixiang said that under the education of Wang Zhong's bourgeois news theory, many of the students who graduated this year did not dare to work for the Party newspaper, fearing being constrained by "dogmatism." Chu Zuyi and others revealed the negative impact of Wang Zhong's bourgeois news theory on their writing of graduation theses. He said that almost all graduation theses accepted Wang Zhong's erroneous theory to varying degrees. Some people wrote a thesis on evening newspapers, arguing that they should emphasize entertainment and interest, and focus on providing amusement, completely obliterating the ideological nature of newspapers, based on Wang Zhong's advocated principle of "softer, softer, and softer again" for the Xinmin Bao evening edition.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: From July 12th to 24th, the Shanghai news circles held four consecutive symposiums, exposing the various ugly faces and reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists in the Shanghai news circles.

As of the 24th, in addition to Xu Zhucheng, Pu Xixiu, and Lu Yi, others who had been exposed included Fan Yan and Lü Wen, Xu Zhucheng's two lieutenants in the Wenhui Bao; Chen Weisi, a reporter for the Xinwen Ribao who masqueraded as a Communist Party member and set fires everywhere, and Lu Yi's backbone; and Xu Junyuan, the former editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Dagong Bao.

Fan Yan was originally a person who had joined the Kuomintang as early as 1942 and participated in many Kuomintang reactionary activities. Xu Zhucheng sent him to the southwest for interviews, and he went there with the ambition of "opening up a battlefield in the southwest." Fan's "Liushahe on 'Caomu Pian'" was written with the help of the Rightists of the Sichuan Democratic League. Fan also set fires at the Sichuan People's Art Theater, set fires in Hunan, and set fires at universities in Sichuan. He told special correspondents: The more sharp the articles criticizing the Communist Party, the better; we guarantee to publish them.

Fan Yan made a seemingly sincere self-criticism for more than half an hour at the meeting on the 24th, but he only talked about small things that others had already revealed, portraying himself as if he had been used; he spoke vaguely about his relationship with the Rightists of the Democratic League. After his self-criticism, more than a dozen people spoke, accusing his self-criticism of being extremely dishonest and demanding that he continue to make self-criticisms in the future.

Lü Wen (member of the Democratic League) was originally the well-known anti-Communist correspondent of the Tianjin Yishi Bao stationed in the Northeast. In his speech at the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China propaganda meeting in May this year, Lü Wen maliciously provoked the relationship between Party and non-Party reporters, attempting to cancel the Party's leadership over news work under the pretext of "lack of freedom of reporting." He divided reporters into four classes, saying that non-Party reporters were running into walls everywhere now and feeling disheartened, and that he himself felt that life was boring. The Wenhui Bao editorial department did not publish his entire speech, and Xu Zhucheng protested. Zhou Renxia and others of the Xinwen Ribao exposed Chen Weisi, a reporter who set fires everywhere during the period of blooming and contending, as a swindler who had worn three "masks" for the past eight years since liberation. Chen claimed to be an "old cadre," a "Communist Party member," and possessed a "socialist conscience," but he was actually a revolutionary traitor and deserter who had entered and left the liberated areas twice, had participated in the Kuomintang's anti-Communist youth organization, and had betrayed revolutionary comrades. During the period of blooming and contending, Chen Weisi took advantage of his work to set fires everywhere, setting three fires in the industrial and commercial circles alone, attempting to provoke public-private relations and incite small business owners to withdraw from public-private joint ventures.

### 上海新闻界同右派分子展开斗争  驳斥王中反党的新闻观点  揭发出范琰、吕文、陈伟斯、许君远的反动言行

    上海新闻界同右派分子展开斗争
    驳斥王中反党的新闻观点
    揭发出范琰、吕文、陈伟斯、许君远的反动言行
    据新华社上海25日电　在24日举行的上海新闻工作者座谈会第四次会议上，复旦大学新闻系主任王中的资产阶级新闻观点受到了严厉的批判。
    王中是一个共产党员，可是他对党的新闻事业的根本原则，作了一系列的攻击，企图以资产阶级的新闻理论来代替无产阶级的新闻学说。
    根据座谈会上印发的材料和到会者揭露，王中企图否定报纸的党性和阶级性。在他所编的“新闻学原理大纲”中说：“我的基本论点是新闻事业是社会发展到一定的历史阶段，由于人们对政治、经济、文化各方面的需要产生了新闻事业，不能够说报纸是阶级斗争的产物。”因此他认为一切政党的报纸具有两重性，首先是商品性，其次才是政党的宣传工具。
    从这个基本理论出发，他竭力提倡所谓的“为读者服务”，不要指导性，要有趣味性等等。
    新闻日报副总编辑郑拾风说：王中在谈到报纸是阶级斗争工具和思想性、指导性等问题时，总是用尽一切恶毒的词句。他甚至说，要说阶级斗争，人们大便也可以连系上。因为人们大便后，多吃饭身体健康，可以去杀敌斗争。
    郑拾风还揭露：王中根据“人咬狗是新闻”的理论，认为新华日报所登的一条消息谈合作化后96％的农业合作社增加收入是大家知道的事，不是新闻，4％减少收入倒是新闻。这就是说，成绩是主要的就不必宣传，要写新闻就得从缺点中去找。这种论调很奇怪，竟完全同右派分子的论调一样。
    复旦大学新闻系四年级学生赵桂祥等在会上控诉王中对他们的毒害。赵桂祥说，在王中的资产阶级新闻理论教育下，今年毕业的同学，许多人不敢到党报去工作，怕被“教条主义”束缚。储祖诒等揭露王中的资产阶级新闻理论在他们写毕业论文中所产生的恶劣影响。他说，几乎所有的毕业论文，都或多或少地接受了王中的错误理论。有的人写了一篇论晚报的论文，根据王中所推崇的新民报晚刊“软些、软些、再软些”的方针，认为应该强调娱乐性、趣味性，供人消遣为主，根本抹杀了报纸的思想性。
    据新华社上海25日电　7月12日到24日，上海新闻界连续召开了四次座谈会，揭发上海新闻界右派分子的各种丑恶面貌和反动言行。
    到24日为止，已被揭露的除了徐铸成、浦熙修和陆诒等外，还有徐铸成在文汇报的两员干将范琰和吕文，有新闻日报冒充共产党员到处放火的记者、陆诒的骨干陈伟斯，以及前上海大公报编辑主任许君远等人。
    范琰原来是个从1942年起就投靠国民党并且参加过国民党多次反动活动的人。徐铸成派他到西南采访，他就是抱着“到西南开辟战场”的野心去的。范所写的“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”是依靠四川民盟右派分子的帮助写成的。范还到四川“人艺”放火，到湖南放火，到四川高等学校放火。他告诉特约记者说：凡是批评共产党的搞子越尖锐越好，我们保证发表。
    范琰24日在会上作了半个多钟头貌似诚恳的检讨，但谈的都是些别人已经揭发了的小事情，把自己说成似乎是被利用了；对自己和民盟右派分子的关系讲的吞吞吐吐。他检讨后，接着就有十来个人发言，指责他的检讨极不老实，要求以后继续检讨。
    吕文（民盟盟员），原来是以反共著名的天津益世报驻东北特派员。吕文今年5月在中共上海市委召开的宣传会议的发言中，恶意地挑拨党同非党记者的关系，借口“采访不自由”，企图取消党对新闻工作的领导。他把记者分成四等，说非党记者现在到处碰钉子，心情灰溜溜的，他自己感到人生都乏味了。文汇报编辑部没有全刊登他的这篇发言，徐铸成曾经提出抗议。新闻日报的周人侠等揭露鸣放期间到处放火的记者陈伟斯，原来是解放八年来身披三张“画皮”的骗子手。陈自称是“老干部”、“共产党员”、富有“社会主义良心”，其实是曾经两进两出于解放区的革命叛徒和逃兵，曾经参加过国民党的反共青年组织，出卖过革命同志。鸣放期间，陈伟斯借工作之便在外面到处点火，单是在工商界就点了三把火，企图挑拨公私关系煽动小业主退出公私合营。
