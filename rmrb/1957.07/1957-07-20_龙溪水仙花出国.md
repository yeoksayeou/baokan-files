    Longxi Daffodils Go Abroad
    The precious Longxi daffodils from Fujian have begun to be harvested. The first batch of daffodils purchased by the Zhangzhou Native Produce Purchasing and Wholesale Station of the Fujian Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has begun to be shipped abroad.

    This year, the Longxi daffodils are growing well, with large and plump bulbs and a long flowering period. The total output this year may reach 350,000 bulbs. This flower is harvested around the "Grain in Ear" period and gradually blooms in December. It is fragrant, cold-resistant, and has long enjoyed a high reputation in the world flower market.

    龙溪水仙花出国
    名贵的福建龙溪水仙花开始收获了。福建省供销社漳州土产采购批发站收购的第一批水仙花已开始装运出国。
    今年龙溪水仙花长得好，颗粒肥大，花期很长。今年总产量可达三十五万颗。这种花在“芒种”前后收获，12月份才逐渐开花，清香，耐寒，在世界花卉市场上久享盛名。
