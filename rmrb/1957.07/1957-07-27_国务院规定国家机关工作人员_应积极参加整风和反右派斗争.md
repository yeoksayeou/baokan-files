Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: Decision of the State Council on Staff Members of State Organs Participating in the Rectification Movement and the Struggle Against Bourgeois Rightists (Adopted at the 55th Plenary Session of the State Council on July 26, 1957)

Currently, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people are engaged in a Rectification Movement and a serious struggle against bourgeois rightists. This struggle is a struggle to defend our country's socialist revolution and our country's fundamental system. According to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China that "all staff members of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people," all staff members of state organs should regard participation in this movement and struggle as their lofty obligation and due responsibility. Therefore, the State Council has decided: All staff members in units undergoing rectification should actively participate in this movement and struggle. In the movement and struggle, they should firmly maintain their stand, distinguish right from wrong, thoroughly expose and criticize all the words and actions of bourgeois rightists, thereby raising their own political and ideological awareness, earnestly overcoming shortcomings, improving their work, and enabling our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction to achieve further victories.
