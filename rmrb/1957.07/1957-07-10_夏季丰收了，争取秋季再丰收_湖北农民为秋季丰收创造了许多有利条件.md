Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 8th: Hubei Province, having achieved a summer harvest, is seeing its agricultural cooperatives and farmers vigorously striving for a great autumn harvest.

The summer harvest has further consolidated the agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province and created many favorable conditions for autumn production. About 90% of the province's agricultural cooperatives have increased production, and the vast majority of members have increased their income. For example, the Xianfeng No. 1 Cooperative in Fengpu Township, Xinzhou County, harvested 200,000 jin of wheat this year, a threefold increase compared to the actual harvest of 50,000 jin last year. All 364 member households in the cooperative increased their income. Member Hu Gouya received only 16.2 yuan last summer, but this summer he received 148.1 yuan. The cooperative's six "Five Guarantees" households were only given enough food last summer, but this year, in addition to giving them enough food, they were also given 150 jin of firewood and grass, 30 jin of surplus grain rewards, and 4.8 yuan for pocket money.

As income has increased, members of the agricultural cooperatives have not only improved their living standards, but also shown a greater enthusiasm for investing in the cooperatives to expand reproduction. The aforementioned Xianfeng No. 1 Cooperative in Xinzhou County recently used funds invested by its members to buy 11,000 jin of oil cake as top dressing for rice and cotton. Agricultural cooperatives across the province that have achieved good harvests have expressed their intention to strive for even greater harvests throughout the year on the basis of increased summer production.

    夏季丰收了，争取秋季再丰收
    湖北农民为秋季丰收创造了许多有利条件
    新华社武汉8日电　夏季丰收了的湖北省，全省的农业社和农民又在朝气蓬勃地争取秋季大丰收。
    夏季丰收，使湖北省的农业社进一步地得到了巩固，并为秋季生产，创造了很多有利条件。全省90％左右的农业社都增了产，绝大多数社员增加了收入。例如新洲县冯铺乡先锋一社，今年收获了小麦二十万斤，比去年实收小麦五万斤增加了三倍。全社三百六十四户社员户户增加了收入。社员胡苟伢，去年夏季只分得十六·二元，今年夏季分得了一百四十八元一角。社里六户“五保户”，去年夏季只给他们分够了口粮，今年除给他们分足口粮以外，还给他们每人分了一百五十斤柴草，三十斤超产奖励粮和四元八角零用钱。
    由于收入增加了，各农业社的社员不只生活有所改善，而且向社里投资来扩大再生产的积极性也高了。前述新洲县先锋一社最近就用社员所投的资金，买回了一万一千斤油饼，作水稻和棉花的追肥。全省各地获得丰收的社，社员都表示，要在夏收增产的基础上，争取全年更大的丰收。
