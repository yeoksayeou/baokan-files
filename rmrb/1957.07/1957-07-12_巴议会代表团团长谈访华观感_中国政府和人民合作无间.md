Xinhua News Agency, July 11th. The head of the Pakistani Parliamentary Delegation, Mujibur Rahman, told reporters who visited him today that "his deepest impression of his visit to China was the diligence of the Chinese people, the integrity and honesty of the Chinese government, and the close cooperation between the government and the people."

Head of Delegation Rahman had visited China in 1952. He said, "The speed of China's development in industry and agriculture is beyond our expectations. If China continues to develop at this speed, in twenty years, I don't think anyone would dare to touch a hair on the head of the Chinese people."

When talking about strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan, Rahman said, "We must further strengthen mutual understanding and increase exchanges of political, economic, and cultural delegations." He said, "The Pakistani people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people, and they are eager to get along in a friendly manner and further develop their traditional friendship."

Head of Delegation Rahman also said, "In the past year, exchanges of delegations between the two sides have been very frequent. Now, many cities in Pakistan have established Pakistan-China Friendship Associations." He believes that the activities of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association will continue to increase, "because the people of our two countries demand peace and have a common desire to develop friendly relations."

He also talked about the desire of the two governments to increase the volume of trade between the two countries.

Finally, he expressed his gratitude for the warm and friendly reception of the Chinese people, and said, "For the sake of world peace and for the construction of their own motherland, Asian countries should unite."

    新华社11日讯　巴基斯坦议会代表团团长穆吉布尔·拉赫曼今天向访问他的记者们说，“他这次在中国访问的最深印象是中国人民的勤劳、中国政府的正直诚实以及政府和人民之间的密切合作。”
    拉赫曼团长曾在1952年来过中国。他说，“中国在工农业方面发展的速度出乎我们意料之外。如果中国像这样速度发展下去，过了二十年，我想谁也不敢动一下中国人民的汗毛。”
    拉赫曼在谈到加强中巴两国人民的友谊时说，“我们必须进一步加强相互了解和增加政治、经济、文化代表团的往来。”他说，“巴基斯坦人民对中国人民有着深厚的友谊，他们渴望友好相处和进一步发展传统的友谊。”
    拉赫曼团长还说，“近一年来，双方代表团的交往十分频繁，现在，巴基斯坦的许多城市已成立了巴中友好协会”。他相信巴中友好协会的活动还会不断增加，“因为我们两国人民要求和平，并对发展友好关系有着共同愿望”。
    他还谈到两国政府都有着增加两国之间贸易量的愿望。
    他最后对中国人民的热诚友好招待表示感谢，并说，“为了世界和平、为了建设自己的祖国，亚洲国家应该团结起来。”
