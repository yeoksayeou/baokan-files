Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st: With the struggle against the Rightists as the main content, class education is being widely conducted in rural Fujian. The solidarity among farmers has been strengthened, production enthusiasm is high, cadres' initiative has been raised, those who were influenced by the Rightists have awakened, the landlords and rich peasants who attempted to take the opportunity to restore the old order have been isolated, and the bad elements who incited farmers to withdraw from the cooperatives have been struck.

"Do a good job in all current tasks and strive for a bumper harvest" has become the action slogan of the broad masses of farmers in Fujian Province to support the struggle against the bourgeois Rightists. The situation in various places shows that carrying out class education in the countryside, with the struggle against the Rightists as the main content, is an important driving force for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and farmers and promoting their current work.

The class education work that began in Fujian Province in June is currently being carried out widely and in depth in rural areas. Various localities have used a variety of ways to explain to cadres and farmers and organize them to discuss the current situation, the nature of the struggle against the Rightists, and how to support the struggle against the Rightists with practical actions. The broad masses of rural grassroots cadres and farmers are extremely angry about the Rightists' conspiracies and poisonous schemes against the Party, against socialism, and against the people. "Whoever opposes the Communist Party, the savior who led us to liberation, and opposes socialism, we will fight to the end." The broad masses of cadres and farmers have mobilized to support the defeat of the bourgeois Rightists' rampant attacks by doing a good job in current work, especially production work. At present, the enthusiasm of farmers in various places for summer harvesting and planting is very high, and the unity among farmers has also been strengthened. Qianlin Village of the 912 Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County has more than 1,000 peach trees. Because the problem of price reduction was not resolved, the peaches were ripe, and the cooperative members did not allow the cooperative to pick them. After receiving class education in the struggle against the Rightists, they all said, "We farmers must unite to consolidate the cooperative, which is beneficial to socialism, so that the Rightists have no loopholes to exploit." The cooperative members themselves put forward the standard for price reduction into the cooperative, and the problem that had been delayed for more than a month was reasonably resolved in a few hours. The cooperative also sold more grain to the state this summer than originally planned. There are similar examples to the 912 Agricultural Cooperative in other places.

The class education of the struggle against the Rightists has improved the work enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural cadres. Cadres who were originally active and firm in their stand are now more energetic and confident; those who were passively influenced by the Rightists' attacks and even unwilling to be cadres are now standing tall and working actively; in some places, the militia have not been on duty for a long time, but now they have raised their vigilance and resumed standing guard and patrolling to protect the summer harvest. Some people who could not distinguish between the anti-socialist remarks of the Rightists and had some confused ideas have also awakened. Those landlords, rich peasants, and remnant counter-revolutionaries who attempted to take the opportunity to counterattack and restore the old order, spread rumors and sabotage, are now isolated, and some have been effectively countered. For example, Jin Yulu Ling, a bad element in Shangjie Township, Minhou County, took advantage of the rampant attacks by Rightists in various places against the Party and the people, and wantonly spread rumors and sabotage in the countryside, and incited farmers to withdraw from the cooperatives. The cooperative members carried out a serious struggle against Jin Yulu Ling's sabotage activities, and ordered this bad element to bow his head and confess his guilt to the people.

The methods of class education in various places include cadre meetings, cooperative member meetings, report meetings, small forums, and wired broadcasts, etc. Through these meetings, the various reactionary words and deeds of Rightists across the country and in the province were exposed, and combined with the specific situation of the county and township, the broad masses of cadres and the masses were educated to recognize the situation, raise their vigilance, and draw a clear ideological line with the Rightists. The experience of various places proves that:
  "Comparing the past, looking at the present, and thinking about the future" is a very effective comparative education method. When carrying out comparative education, most places do the following: First, a comparison of political liberation. This further enables everyone to recognize that socialist democracy is true people's democracy, and the socialist order is also unprecedented, so as to criticize the Rightists' fallacies that slander the socialist system as bad and that collectivization is "not free." Second, a comparison of production development. This affirms that the achievements of the Communist Party and the People's Government in leading farmers to develop production are unprecedented in history, and refutes the Rightists' fallacies that collectivization has no superiority. Third, refuting the Rightists' nonsense about "the hard life of farmers" from the comparison of improved living standards, and exposing the Rightists' conspiracy to provoke the relationship between workers and peasants and the relationship between the Party and the masses. Fourth, compare the changes in local construction, culture, health, transportation, and municipal administration before and after liberation, so that cadres and the masses can recognize the new face of society and further firmly support the Party and the path of socialism.

### 福建农村广泛进行阶级教育

    以反右派斗争为主要内容
    福建农村广泛进行阶级教育
    农民内部团结增强，生产劲头很大，干部积极性提高，受过右派影响的人醒悟过来，企图乘机复辟的地主富农已经孤立，煽动农民退社的坏分子受到打击
    新华社福州21日电　“作好当前各项工作，争取农业大丰收”已经成为福建省广大农民支援反资产阶级右派斗争的行动口号。各地的情况表明：在农村中进行一次以反右派斗争为主要内容的阶级教育，是调动广大干部和农民的积极性，推动他们作好当前工作的重要动力。
    福建省从6月份开始的这一次阶级教育工作目前正在各地农村中广泛而深入地进行。各地通过多种多样的方式向干部和农民讲解并且组织他们讨论了当前形势和反右派斗争的性质以及如何以实际行动来支援反右派斗争等问题。广大农村基层干部和农民对右派分子反党、反社会主义、反人民的阴谋毒计，愤怒异常。“谁要反对领导我们翻身的救星共产党和反对社会主义，我们就和谁斗争到底”。广大干部和农民纷纷动员起来，以作好当前工作，特别是生产工作来支援打退资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻。目前各地农民夏收夏种的劲头很大，农民之间的团结也加强了。海澄县九一二农业社的前林村有一千多株桃树，因为折价问题未解决，桃子熟了社员也不让社里去摘。当他们受到反右派斗争的阶级教育以后，都说“我们农民内部要团结起来，巩固合作社才对社会主义有利，使右派分子没有空子可钻”。社员们自己提出了折价入社的标准，拖延一个多月未解决的问题，几个钟头就合理解决了。这个社夏季卖给国家的粮食也比原计划增加了。像九一二农业社这样的事例其他各地都有。
    反右派斗争的阶级教育提高了农村广大干部的工作积极性。原来工作积极、立场坚定的干部，现在劲头更足，信心倍增；那些曾为右派分子进攻的影响而消极起来甚至不愿当干部的人，现在腰杆挺硬，工作积极；有些地方民兵已经很久不站岗，现在他们都提高了警惕，恢复站岗巡逻，保卫夏收。部分对右派分子反社会主义言论分辨不清存在一些糊涂思想的人也醒悟过来。那些企图乘机反攻复辟、造谣破坏的地主富农和残余反革命分子现在已经孤立起来，有的已受到有力的回击。例如闽侯县上街乡坏分子金俞露玲趁各地右派分子向党向人民猖狂进攻的时候，在农村中大肆造谣破坏，并且煽动农民退社。社员们同金俞露玲的破坏活动进行了严肃的斗争，责令这个坏分子向人民低头认罪。
    各地进行阶级教育的方法有干部会、社员大会、报告会、小型座谈会和有线广播等等。通过这些会议揭发全国和本省右派分子各种反动言行，并和本县、本乡的具体情况联系起来，教育广大干部和群众认清形势、提高警惕，和右派分子划清思想界限。各地的经验证明：
  “比过去，看现在，想将来”的对比教育方法，效果很好。在进行对比教育时，各地大都是：一、政治上翻身的对比。从而使大家进一步认识社会主义民主是真正的人民民主，社会主义秩序也是空前未有的，以批判右派分子诬蔑社会主义制度不好，合作化“不自由”的邪说。二、生产发展的对比。从而肯定共产党和人民政府领导农民发展生产的成绩是历史上所未有的，批驳右派分子叫嚣合作化没有优越性的谬论。三、从生活改善的对比来驳斥右派分子所谓“农民生活苦”的胡说，揭露右派分子挑拨工农关系、党群关系的阴谋。四、对比解放前后的地方建设、文化、卫生、交通、市政等方面的变化，使干部和群众认清新社会的面貌，进一步坚定地拥护党和走社会主义道路的信心。
