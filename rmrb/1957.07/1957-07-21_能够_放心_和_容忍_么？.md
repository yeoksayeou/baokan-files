Can we "Trust" and "Tolerate"?
    Kang Zhuo

    In the People's Daily of the 12th of this month, Comrade He Gurun's article "What Kind of Democracy and Freedom is Xiao Qian Contending For?" refuted Xiao Qian's writing "Trust, Tolerance, and Personnel Work". I completely agree with Comrade He's argument. However, Comrade He Gurun only assessed Xiao Qian's work as having errors in "several fundamental points," and did not seem to consider the article fundamentally a poisonous weed. I think this underestimates the high degree of ingenuity and artful disguise in Xiao Qian's work.

    If you disagree, allow me to add a few points.

    First, on democracy and freedom. Xiao Qian wrote: "Before capitalist countries entered the stage of imperialism, they had a very bold saying: 'I completely disagree with your views, but I am willing to sacrifice my life to defend your right to express those views.' This sentence contains their pride in their constitution, their democratic traditions, and their system." He also said: "Whether or not to allow incorrect statements is a serious test of any democratic constitution." Then he said that although we currently have a democratic and free constitution, unfortunately, not every Chinese person has the freedom to speak and write. According to the author's implication, this is because our Party and government cannot "tolerate" or "trust" people to say incorrect things. Thus, our constitution has failed Xiao Qian's "test"! The most extensive socialist democracy and freedom of the broadest masses of people, which we fought for with countless lives and blood, is not as good as the hypocritical democracy and freedom of early capitalism, which essentially only allowed a very small number of people to exploit the vast majority! Our current socialist system is not as "bold" as early capitalism! Isn't this too similar to the arguments of many right-wing elements, and something the Chinese people cannot "trust" or "tolerate"? Perhaps Xiao Qian will say that he didn't mean that, and that his words were only meant to point out that "we are not very experienced in the exercise of the democratic spirit." If so, how exactly can "we" exercise to catch up with the rising bourgeoisie? Obviously, it is impossible to want the Party and the people to "exercise" so that they can "trust" and "tolerate" any remarks that promote capitalism and oppose socialism. Therefore, there is probably only one path, which is that Xiao Qian himself must reluctantly "exercise" a bit. And Xiao Qian's nostalgia for the past, revealed when he quoted that "bold saying" of the bourgeoisie, has something in common with the right-wing elements' enthusiasm for the so-called "bicameral system," and really needs to be "exercised" and transformed.

    Second, on the rectification movement. Xiao Qian's article doesn't seem to mention this event, but the content does involve it. After talking about how "comrades whose emotions have been suppressed for many years" "got the opportunity to express their views" some time ago, he wrote:

    "And some comrades who are doing leadership work today, and will continue to do leadership work in the future, I estimate may feel that 'intellectuals are inherently difficult to deal with, and now they will be even more difficult to deal with.'" Leaving aside "comrades whose emotions have been suppressed for many years," these few sentences are actually very knowledgeable; because the author did not distinguish that, during the recent period of great blooming and contending and helping the Party rectify its style, most of the opinions put forward by intellectuals were out of love for the Party and not some kind of repressed expression. Nor did he distinguish that some so-called repressed expressions were nothing more than reactionary remarks made by right-wing elements after their capitalist fantasies were suppressed, or biased remarks made temporarily under some instigation. Perhaps a very small number of intellectuals have suffered some suppression, but it is precisely only the Party that can restore their suppressed feelings – in short, the author should have specifically distinguished the various specific circumstances mentioned above. But the cleverness lies in the fact that the author precisely believes that, in our Party's rectification movement, some Party cadres "doing leadership work" may have adverse reactions to hearing opinions, or, in other words, resist criticism and rectification, and even want to treat the criticism given by intellectuals with a dark mentality of retaliation, and these people who resist rectification and criticism happen to be "comrades who are doing leadership work today, and will continue to do leadership work in the future"! This means that the Chinese Communist Party and the Party's rectification movement are nothing more than a hypocrisy! You are all just eating as Party members anyway, whether you rectify your style or not, you are sitting on an ironclad regime! Here, isn't the right-wing elements' argument of "the Party's world" almost ready to come out?

    Third, "the personnel department is the police station stationed in the institution." Comrade He Gurun has already criticized this point, but what can be added is that Xiao Qian has actually praised our current police station in all aspects, and believes that today's police station has changed the "terrifying and mysterious" state of the police station before liberation; he only believes that the personnel departments of some institutions and groups today, although not "terrifying," "but have a bit of a mysterious flavor," which is to say, have a bit of the "mysterious" flavor of the police stations of the reactionaries who suppressed the people before liberation! We must deeply understand this kind of cautious wording and sinister ingenuity in Xiao Qian's writing, and we must never underestimate or downplay the author's intentions.

    Fourth, the writing style of the entire article. It is truly circuitous, tortuous, and highly artistic. He regards the climate of the recent period not as early spring but as "early summer," and says that the work of personnel departments nationwide "must be healthy," and also judges some people's incorrect views as seemingly fair as "biased" or even "distorted," and the examples cited for criticism are all heard from "friends" or "non-Party comrades," as if he himself is exceptionally objective, and he is just speaking out a few words on behalf of those "comrades" when he sees an injustice on the road; but in essence, he is hinting everywhere that our real life is nothing more than a tragic and mysterious picture. In addition, the previous sentence says that the gap between the cadres of the personnel department and everyone is a "necessity in work," and the next sentence says that he "never knew why there was such a necessity"! He even said that writing letters to the Party's general branch (including the Central Propaganda Department) "often sinks like a stone in the sea," "which is more uncomfortable than being beaten with a stick"! Finally, he cited the various scandals of "a people's organization" that almost violated "the laws of the feudal era," but he dared not say which organization it was, as if he were walking on thin ice! Of course, our Party's Central Propaganda Department and any organization can be criticized, and Xiao Qian's article has not been deprived of its freedom to be published; then, why not truthfully confess and appeal regarding the Central Propaganda Department that wants to make people "beaten with a stick" and a certain organization with numerous scandals, but instead use such insinuation, wielding the methods and ingenuity of a progressive writer before liberation throwing a dagger at the reactionaries at that time?

    One cannot but think that Xiao Qian's article is fundamentally a poisonous weed. And for such a poisonous weed, can we "trust" and "tolerate" it? The answer is: no.

    能够“放心”和“容忍”么？
    康濯
    本月12日人民日报上何谷润同志“萧乾所争的是什么样的民主自由？”一文，对萧乾所写“放心·容忍·人事工作”进行了驳斥。我是完全同意何文的论点的。不过，何谷润同志仅仅把萧乾的大作评为“若干根本论点”有错误，而似乎并未认为该文根本上乃系一株毒草，我以为这怕是委屈了与低估了萧乾大作中巧妙乔装的高度匠心的。
    如若不以为然，待我补充几笔。
    一曰民主自由。萧乾写道：“在资本主义国家没进入帝国主义阶段以前，他们有一句非常豪迈的话：‘我完全不同意你的看法，但是我情愿牺牲我的性命，来维护你说出这个看法的权利。’在这句话里蕴藏着他们对自己的宪法、对他们的民主传统和制度的自豪。”又道：“准不准许说不对的话是任何民主宪法的严重考验。”然后就说，我们目前虽然有了民主自由的宪法，可惜还不是每个中国人都有了说话和写作的自由；这原因，据作者的暗示，乃在于我们的党和政府还不能“容忍”以及不能“放心”地让人们说不对的话。于是，我们的宪法就这样没能通过萧乾的“考验”！而我们付出无数性命和血汗才争取来的，最广大人民的最充分的社会主义民主自由，原来还不如那尽管是前期资本主义，但本质依然是只允许极少数人剥削绝大多数人的虚伪的民主自由！原来我们目前的社会主义制度，还不如前期资本主义那么“豪迈”！这不是和许多右派分子的论调太为近似，而万万不能使中国人民“放心”和“容忍”的么？也许萧乾要说，他哪是这个意思，他那些话只不过在于指出“我们在民主精神的锻炼上，不能算很多”。果如此，则“我们”到底要怎样才能锻炼得赶上上升期的资产阶级呢？很明显，想要党和人民“锻炼”得能够“放心”和“容忍”任何宣扬资本主义与反对社会主义的言论，那是无法办到的。因而路子恐怕只有一条，即是萧乾本人还得委屈地“锻炼”一下。而萧乾在引述那句资产阶级的“豪迈的话”之时，流露出来的与右派分子对于所谓“两院制”的热中有着相通之处的眷恋往昔的感情，怕也实在是需要加以“锻炼”改造的。
    二曰整风运动。萧乾文章中似乎并没提到这件事，但内容倒确是涉及了的。他在讲到前些时“多年来感情上受压抑的同志们”“得到一抒己见的机会”以后，跟着写道：
    “而有些今天做领导工作，以后也仍然要做领导工作的同志，心里我估计可能会有‘知识分子本来就不好搞，这下子就更不好搞了’之感”这里且不说“多年来感情上受压抑的同志们”等等，这几句话其实也是大有学问的；因为作者并没分辨在前些时大放大鸣和帮助党整风的时候，大多数知识分子提出的意见是出于对党的爱护而并非什么受压抑后的抒发，也没分辨某些所谓受压抑后的抒发，有的只是右派分子的资本主义幻想受压抑后发出的反动言论，有的则是受到什么煽动而一时抒发的偏激之言，容或也有极少数知识分子受过某些压抑，但那也恰恰只有党才得以为他平复压抑——总之，作者原是应该具体地分辨上述种种具体情况的。但巧妙之处还在后边，即是作者恰恰在我们党的整风运动中，认为有些党的“做领导工作”的干部可能听到意见会有反感，或者说，会抗拒批评和整风，甚至还会要以以牙还牙的阴暗心情来对待知识分子所给予的批评似的，而这些抗拒整风和批评的又偏偏是“今天做领导工作，以后也仍然要做领导工作的同志”！这就是说，中国共产党和党的整风运动原不过是一场虚伪！你们反正凭党员吃饭，你们整不整风，反正坐的是铁桶江山！在这里，右派分子的“党天下”的论调，难道不是险些就要呼之即出么？
    三曰“人事科是驻在机关的派出所”。此点何谷润同志已加批驳，但还可以补充的是，萧乾对于我们今天的派出所倒还是从东西南北各方面着实歌颂了一番，并认为今天的派出所已改变了解放前派出所的“恐怖、神秘”之状的；他只不过认为今天有些机关团体的人事部门，则虽无“恐怖”，“但却多少带有一些神秘味道”，也即是说，多少带有一些解放前反动派镇压人民的那种派出所的“神秘”味道！萧乾文字中此类用词谨慎而又透露出不怀好意的高明匠心之处，我们是必须深刻体会，而决不能低估与委屈了作者的。
    四曰整个文章的写法。那真是迂回曲折，艺大才高。既把前些时的气候不看作早春而视为“初夏”，又说全国范围内人事部门的工作“一定是健康的”，并且还把有些人的不正确看法貌似公正地评为“偏，甚至“歪”，而文中所列以批评的事例也尽是从“朋友”或“非党同志”处听来，好像他自己分外客观，他不过是路见不平，代表那些“同志们”抒发几句；但实质上却又在在暗示我们的现实生活不过是悲惨和神秘的图景。此外，前一句说人事部门的干部同大家的隔阂是“工作上的必要”，后一句又说他“始终也不知道为什么会有这种必要”！甚至还说给党总支（包括中央宣传部）写信，“时常是石沉大海”，“比挨顿棍子要难受多了”！最后又举出“一个人民团体”的几乎要违反“封建时代的法律”的种种丑行，却又俨然如履薄冰似地不敢说出是哪一个团体！当然，我们党的中宣部和任何团体都是可以批评的，而萧乾的文章也并没被剥夺发表的自由；那末，为什么对于要使人“挨棍子”的中宣部和丑行累累的某团体，竟不据实地坦白陈情，而要如此含沙射影，搬弄着好像一个解放前的进步作家向当时的反动派投以匕首的手法和匠心呢？
    不能不认为萧乾这篇文章根本上是一株毒草。而对于这样的毒草，我们能够“放心”和“容忍”么？答曰：不能。
