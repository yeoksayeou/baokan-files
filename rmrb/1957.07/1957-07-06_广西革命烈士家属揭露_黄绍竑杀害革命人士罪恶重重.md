Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 4th: The families of revolutionary martyrs in Nanning, Guangxi, who were killed by Huang Shaohong in 1927, jointly wrote an open letter to Huang Shaohong on the 3rd, expressing their intolerance of his malicious attacks on socialism and the leadership of the Party, and declaring their intention to fight him to the end.

The letter stated: We must expose the past crimes of rightist Huang Shaohong in Guangxi, so that he can recognize the gravity of his past sins and experience the leniency of the Party and the people towards him.

During the Great Revolution, Huang Shaohong served as the Chairman of Guangxi Province, Commander of the 15th Army, Special Envoy, and Director of the "Purification Campaign." He personally presided over the "April 12th" purification campaign in Guangxi. Although thirty years have passed, Huang Shaohong should still have vivid memories of it. Thirty years ago, Huang Shaohong betrayed the revolution, betrayed the will of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and killed our ancestors and many revolutionary martyrs. He relied on this lifelong "masterpiece" to gain the favor of Chiang Kai-shek, hold important positions, and rise to prominence.

On the eve of April 12, 1927, Huang Shaohong personally issued a secret order to arrest Guangxi revolutionaries on a large scale. In Nanning alone, more than a thousand Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, workers, farmers, teachers, students, and women were arrested. On September 1 of the same year, Huang Shaohong shot and killed thirteen revolutionary martyrs in Nanning, including Lei Peitao, Zhou Zhongwu, Lei Tianzhuang, Chen Liya, Liang Liudu, He Fuqian, and Deng Zhe, who were the mainstays of revolutionary work in Guangxi at the time. Subsequently, he openly and secretly massacred a large number of revolutionaries in Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Guixian and other places. We want to ask: Where was the law at that time? Huang Shaohong, on the contrary, describes today's people's world as "dark and dismal," and slanders the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as "causing the destruction of countless families, displacement and homelessness." His reactionary arguments are precisely a conclusion to what he did in the past. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the suppression of rebels struck at counter-revolutionaries, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and consolidated the cause of socialist revolution. The government treats counter-revolutionaries who confess their crimes and repent with leniency. Counter-revolutionary family members who have difficulties in life are provided with relief and job placement. However, Huang Shaohong ignores this fact, maliciously attacks it, exaggerates shortcomings, and spews blood. Why does he want to be a "Bao Qingtian" for counter-revolutionaries? What are his intentions?

The letter went on to say that Huang Shaohong is a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and has returned to Guangxi twice to inspect political and legal work. Giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers is one of the main contents of political and legal work, but when he came to Guangxi, he never visited or met with the families of martyrs and soldiers. When he returned to Beijing, the families of martyrs wrote to him, asking him to make a correct comment on the martyrs who sacrificed in Guangxi during the Great Revolution (because before liberation, he slandered the revolutionary martyrs in his book "Fifty Years of Memoirs"), but he has refused to reply to this day. He came to Guangxi to inspect only the archives of judicial work, looking for faults and calling for justice for counter-revolutionaries.

The letter concluded by saying that we, the families of revolutionary martyrs, issue a serious warning to Huang Shaohong: Our loved ones sacrificed at your hands, but under the education of the Party, we have realized the great significance of the united front. For the past eight years, we have always adopted a magnanimous, bygones-be-bygones spirit towards you, hoping that you can deeply reflect on the past, start anew, and work honestly for the people and the cause of socialism to atone for your past crimes. But today you are "ungrateful" and have displayed such sinister tricks to attack the Party, the people, and the socialist cause. If you do not thoroughly repent, you will cut yourself off from the people.

The Nanning martyrs' family members who signed the letter were Zhou Junshi, Chen Kefu, Lei Cheng, Lei Rongen, Luo Qiba, Luo Qizhi, Zhou Xiaoxian, Chen Bingyi, Feng Yongzhuang, Lin Kunpei, Guo Juntao, Ruan Ximei, Huang Xiuqun, He Fuyi, and others, fourteen in total.

    广西革命烈士家属揭露
    黄绍竑杀害革命人士罪恶重重
    新华社南宁4日电　1927年被黄绍竑杀害的广西南宁市的革命烈士家属们，3日联名给黄绍竑写了一封公开信，表示不能容忍他对社会主义、对党的领导的恶意攻击，要和他斗争到底。
    这封信写道：我们要揭露右派分子黄绍竑过去在广西的罪恶，使他认识到自己过去罪恶深重，体验到党和人民对他的宽大。
    大革命时代，黄绍竑身任广西省主席、十五军军长、特派员和“清党”主任委员等职，广西“四一二”清党，是他一手主持的，虽然事隔三十年，但在黄绍竑应该是记忆犹新的。在三十年前，黄绍竑背叛了革命，背叛了孙中山先生的遗志，杀害了我们的先人和许多革命先烈。他靠这一生的“得意杰作”，得到蒋介石的青睐，官居要职，飞黄腾达。
    1927年4月12日前夜，黄绍竑亲下密令大捕广西革命人士，仅在南宁被捕的共产党员、共青团员、工人、农民、教师、学生和妇女，就达千人以上。同年9月1日，黄绍竑在南宁枪杀了当时广西革命工作的主要骨干雷沛涛、周仲武、雷天壮、陈立亚、梁六度、何福谦、邓哲等十三位革命先烈，接着又在桂林、柳州、梧州、贵县等地公开、秘密地大量屠杀革命人士。我们要问：当时法纪何在？黄绍竑反而把今天的人民天下说成“暗无天日”，诋毁肃反“造成多少人家家破人亡，流离失所”，他的这些反动论调，正好为他自己当日所作所为下了结论。肃反和镇反打击了反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政，巩固了社会主义革命事业。政府对认罪悔过的反革命分子是宽大处理的，反革命家属生活困难者得到救济和介绍就业。而黄绍竑无视于此事实，肆意进行恶意攻击，夸大缺点，含血喷人。他为什么要为反革命分子作“包青天”？其居心何在？
    信中接着说，黄绍竑是人大常委，曾两次回广西视察政法工作。优抚工作是政法工作的主要内容之一，但他来到广西，从未访问、接见过烈、军属。当他回北京后，烈属写信给他，要求他对在大革命时代在广西牺牲的烈士们作个正确的评论（因为解放前，他在“五十年回忆录”一书中诬蔑了革命先烈），但他至今拒不作复。他来广西视察只是查查司法工作的档案，在其中找岔子，为反革命分子呼冤。
    信中最后说，我们革命烈士家属向黄绍竑提出严重的警告：我们的亲人牺牲在你手里，但在党的教育下，我们认识到统一战线的重大意义，八年来我们对你总是抱着宽宏大量，既往不咎的精神，希望你能深省过往，重新作人，好好地为人民为社会主义事业老老实实工作，以赎前罪。但是你今天却“忘恩负义”，竟施展出这样阴险的伎俩，来攻击党攻击人民和社会主义事业。如果你不彻底悔过，将自绝于人民。
    在这封信上签名的南宁市烈士家属，有周君实、陈可夫、雷成、雷荣恩、罗启拔、罗启芝、周孝先、陈炳夷、冯永庄、林坤培、郭君涛、阮细妹、黄秀群、何福贻等十四人。
