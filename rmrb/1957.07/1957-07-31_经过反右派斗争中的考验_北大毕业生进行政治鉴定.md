Having Been Tested in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
Peking University Graduates Undergo Political Assessment

    (Our Newspaper) According to the State Council's regulations, all graduating students from higher education institutions will undergo a political assessment (political review) before being assigned jobs from now on. Peking University is currently conducting the political assessment of this year's graduates.

    The main content of this year's graduates' political assessment is to summarize each person's performance in this anti-Rightist struggle. The method of reviewing and assessing each person's speeches, actions, and views on various issues in this struggle involves each individual writing a self-examination with a responsible and honest attitude. This is followed by criticism and discussion at group meetings for approval, and finally reviewed by the department leadership, who then provide their opinions. This assessment will be included as an official archival material.

    In order to help graduates prepare well for their political assessment and to mobilize them to obey the unified job assignment by the state, the Peking University Graduates Allocation Work Committee also held a university-wide graduates' meeting. The chairman of the Graduates Allocation Work Committee, Vice-President Ma Shi'an, delivered a report to the students.

    When talking about why political assessments are necessary, Vice-President Ma Shi'an said that our country's standards for cultivating and employing cadres should pay attention to both moral character and talent. When the Rightists attacked the Party, they proposed abolishing political conditions so that they could fish in troubled waters. But for the sake of socialist construction, we cannot ignore the political conditions of cadres in the slightest. He said: We must not allow a person with serious political problems to hold a position that they should not hold.

    He pointed out that this anti-Rightist struggle is the biggest test of the students' political lives in the past few years. Some people may have scored five points in their regular political exams, but in this practical test, they scored zero or failed, which requires a review. He asked everyone to treat this political assessment work seriously and realistically with a sense of responsibility to the country. He particularly called on those who had made political mistakes to conduct honest self-examinations and not to conceal anything. He emphasized that if one is still not honest in this political assessment, then one has committed another political mistake.

    经过反右派斗争中的考验
    北大毕业生进行政治鉴定
    本报讯　按照国务院的规定，今后历届高等学校毕业生在分配工作以前，都要进行一次政治鉴定（政治审查）。北京大学正在进行今年毕业生的政治鉴定工作。
    今年毕业生政治鉴定的内容，主要就是总结每人在这次反右派斗争中的表现。对每人在这次斗争中的言论、行动及对各个问题的看法等方面进行一次审查、鉴定的方法，首先是由每人以认真负责、忠诚老实的态度写自己的检查，然后在小组会上开展批评，讨论通过，最后由系领导审查，签注意见。这项鉴定，将作为正式的档案材料。
    为了帮助毕业生做好政治鉴定和动员毕业生准备服从国家统一分配，北京大学毕业生分配工作委员会还召开了全校毕业生大会，毕业生分配工作委员会主任委员、马适安副校长向同学作了报告。
    马适安副校长在谈到为什么要做政治鉴定时说，我们国家培养干部和使用干部的标准，都是要注意到德、才两个方面。右派分子在向党进攻时曾提出不要政治条件以便他们混水摸鱼。但我们为了搞社会主义建设，就丝毫也不能忽视干部的政治条件。他说：我们决不能让一个在政治上有严重问题的人，在工作岗位上担任他所不应当担任的工作。
    他指出，这次反右派斗争是几年来同学们政治生活中最大的一次考验。有的人尽管平常政治课考试得了五分，但在这次实际考验中，却考了零分或不及格，这就需要进行一次审查。他要求每人都以对国家负责的态度严肃认真、实事求是地对待这次政治鉴定工作。他特别号召政治上曾经犯了错误的人应当老老实实地进行检查，不应该有丝毫的隐瞒。他强调说，如果在对这次政治鉴定中还不老实，那就又犯了一次政治性的错误。
