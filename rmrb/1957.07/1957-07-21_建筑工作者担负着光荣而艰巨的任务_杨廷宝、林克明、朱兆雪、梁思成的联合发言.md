This conference is convened in the final year of the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, and during the high tide of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement. We first studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and we listened with joy and excitement to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Bo Yibo and Li Xiannian, President Dong, Procurator-General Zhang, and Secretary-General Peng. We fully agree with these reports.

The four of us are architectural workers engaged in urban planning, architectural design, and architectural education. In the socialist construction of our motherland, basic construction accounts for a large proportion, and architectural work accounts for about half of basic construction. We feel the glory and arduousness of our task. We are also proud of the brilliant achievements made by our motherland in urban planning and architecture over the past eight years. Under the wise leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, the vast number of technicians and workers have completed or initially drafted plans for dozens of reconstruction or new construction projects in large and medium-sized cities; built thousands of buildings for various industrial enterprises, including factory and workshop buildings for heavy machinery, mining, metallurgy, and various light industries; and learned to design many industrial buildings that we were previously unable to design. From 1952 to 1956, the state built more than 145 million square meters of civil buildings. This nationwide large-scale construction has, to the greatest extent possible under the conditions, solved many urgent problems for production and the needs of the people's lives. This is unprecedented in China's 5,000-year history. Everyone with a conscience must admit that architectural work, as the work of organizing and building the material space for production and life for the comprehensively unfolded economic and cultural construction, has achieved tremendous results in the past eight years, just like all construction work. Without the leadership of the Party, it would not have been possible to achieve these results. The ironclad facts prove that along with the rapid development of production, the working environment and living environment of the vast number of employees have also gradually improved.

However, on the other hand, we have also made many mistakes and have many shortcomings. Of course, it is difficult for anything to be perfect, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings. Those anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements, blinded by their lust for gain, have developed a misconception from the Party's rectification movement, thinking that they have an opportunity to take advantage of it, attempting to exaggerate some of the shortcomings in our work over the past eight years to negate our achievements, thereby overthrowing the Party and restoring capitalism. This is not only absolutely unacceptable to the 600 million people, but the achievements themselves are the most powerful counterattack against their rampant attacks.

As technical cadres and professional teachers who have dedicated ourselves to architectural work for the past eight years, we do not need to boast about our achievements here. In order to do our future work better, we would rather examine our own work and provide some reference opinions to the Party and the government.

Regarding Design Standards

Consider issues comprehensively and unite the contradictions between applicability, economy, and aesthetics dialectically

I. In 1955, formalism and archaism, which were characterized by extravagance and waste, were criticized. Architectural workers implemented the principle of thrift and achieved certain results, but due to one-sided emphasis on thrift, there was a tendency to neglect applicability and possible aesthetics. In 1956, in order to correct this tendency, the standards were slightly relaxed, which resulted in a certain degree of waste. Why did this phenomenon occur? On the one hand, it was because architectural workers, especially designers, failed to consider issues comprehensively and failed to unite the contradictions between applicability, economy, and aesthetics dialectically. On the other hand, it was also because the national quota standards were divorced from reality, divorced from our country's current production level and people's living habits, and simply copied the standards of some countries with advanced productivity and technology, as well as the standards set according to their living habits. Without revising these standards and simply trying to save money by reducing the cost per unit area, it is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the goal of saving money.

About a month and a half ago, the State Construction Commission convened a national design work conference. At the conference, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo gave us important instructions, and cited the examples of Xingping County in Shaanxi Province and a certain factory in Sichuan Province, which used local materials, technology, and traditions to build workers' residences and dormitories that employees considered satisfactory and cost only about six to ten yuan per square meter. They instructed us to study the past standards and make reasonable revisions. The conference ended more than a month ago, but each design unit is still waiting for further instructions on how to implement the spirit and decisions of the conference.

The two vice premiers instructed that architectural standards must be lowered and that specifications and quotas also need to be revised. Many designers feel that it is difficult for them to set standards and specifications themselves, and they still hope that the Construction Commission can give some more specific instructions. We suggest that in addition to the area quota, which should be strictly controlled by the state, design personnel in various localities can formulate their own standards for use, especially for civil building living standards, according to local conditions and living habits. As for structural standards, they must be determined by the state after scientific research, so that designers can make designs that ensure the safety of buildings under the principle of using local materials and adapting to local conditions.

Regarding Urban Planning

Be able to make a good phased construction plan for urban development; organically integrate cultural relics and buildings into the planning of new cities

II. In terms of urban planning, the two vice premiers mentioned the issue of small and medium-sized cities making only short-term plans without long-term plans. We believe that cities, regardless of size, should have long-term plans. In the past, we had a wrong understanding of planning, only seeing the long-term and not paying enough attention to the short-term, treating the long-term plan as a short-term plan, and failing to make a good phased construction plan for urban development. Therefore, in the construction process, the buildings were scattered, unnecessarily increasing the investment in urban construction, causing huge waste, bringing losses to the country, and causing great inconvenience to the lives of urban residents. On the other hand, there is also serious formalism in urban planning. Opening up roads and arranging neighborhoods often does not adapt to local natural conditions, but uses the "moving mountains and overturning seas" method to fight hard against nature, causing serious waste. All these mistakes are not due to making long-term plans, but because we did not make the plans well, only drawing geometric patterns on the drawings, closing the door and making many wishful calculations, committing the error of subjectivism. We should make our plans better. We must make the planning able to adapt to the recent development of the city, and at the same time make the long-term plan play its due restrictive role, so that the city does not develop haphazardly.

In addition, in the reconstruction of many old cities and in the site selection and construction of new factories and mines, we believe that the historical relics and buildings left over have not received due attention. For example, in cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, and Luoyang, although a certain degree of attention has been paid to the above-ground and underground cultural relics in the planning, site selection, and construction process, due to the inconsistent understanding of "cultural relics," many above-ground cultural relics and buildings have been unnecessarily demolished; many underground historical sites have also been destroyed. Some places have even taken a fancy to the "economic value" of some cultural relics and buildings, while ignoring their greater, irreplaceable historical and artistic value, doing things that are penny-wise and pound-foolish, and "burning the lute to cook cranes." A Liao Dynasty hall of the Guangji Temple in Baodi County, Hebei Province, was demolished to build a highway bridge over the Zhulong River; three Song Dynasty pagodas in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, were demolished to build a highway; the city walls of the outer city of Beijing and countless county towns were demolished because their city walls had "economic value" as one of the reasons. Temples in countless county towns and villages in Jilin Province, which truly had the economic value of being still usable, were demolished on the grounds of eliminating superstition. The buildings of Guangzhou's Guangxiao Temple, which were rebuilt under the correct policy of protecting cultural relics, were damaged under the incorrect policy of use.

The planning and reconstruction of many cities shows that planners only regard some cultural relics and buildings as useless baggage that is a pity to abandon, reluctantly preserving them, thinking that they are stumbling blocks in the development of the city, wishing they could be cleared away all at once. They did not realize the positive factors of many cultural relics and buildings in the composition of a city, and did not organically organize them into the planning of the new city to enrich the lives of urban residents and enrich the appearance of socialist cities. The problem lies in whether our urban planners can correctly handle the contradiction between the old and the new in the process of urban development. If handled well, cultural relics and buildings will not only not hinder the development of the city, but will add to the city's splendor. We hope that the issue of cultural relics and buildings can be valued by local governments, construction units, and planning and design personnel. We especially hope to get the attention of the State Council.

We have accumulated considerable experience in urban planning work in the past eight years, but we have not yet summarized this experience well. We suggest that the Ministry of Urban Construction should summarize these experiences well.

Regarding Housing Policy

Should serve production; rents should be appropriately adjusted in cities to achieve rent-supported housing and rent-generated housing

III. We would like to talk about the housing policy, which is closely related to urban planning and urban construction. We believe that it is inappropriate to treat employee housing and dormitories as welfare facilities of government agencies in a city, especially in a large city. Residential housing in cities should be part of the city, not just part of government agencies and enterprises. At present, many government agencies and enterprises charge only symbolic, very small rents for their employee housing and dormitories. For example, the Ministry of Railways' dormitories, each household of bureau-level cadres has 14 rooms, about 200 square meters, with furniture, telephones, heating, and hot water, and only pays 10 yuan per month in rent; for example, the residential housing of Tsinghua University professors, with an area of more than 90 square meters, the rent is more than twice as expensive as the Ministry of Railways' dormitories, but it only costs 12 yuan and 5 cents per month. Adopting this package-deal method cannot but stimulate everyone to bring their families, and cannot but encourage three generations or four generations to live together. This housing policy does not serve production but consumption. If this continues, no matter how many houses are built, it will not be able to meet the demand. Our economic construction has just begun to turn to socialism, and there is still at least two five-year plans of distance from socialism, but the housing policy has already almost entered the communist world of distribution according to needs.

Taking Beijing as an example, more than 7 million square meters of dormitories have been built since liberation. According to common sense, the state should be able to basically solve the investment problem for housing construction in Beijing in the future without investing any more in residential housing in Beijing. As long as the rent is appropriately adjusted, it can not only support housing through rent, but also generate housing through rent. Capitalist real estate companies can use private capital to make houses generate sons and grandsons. We are not suggesting that the government should make profits from residential building construction, but rather that the rent should be slightly increased to limit the blind inflow of residents from rural areas or small cities, especially non-direct relatives of employees, into the city, exacerbating the housing shortage in the city. The current method is based on the desire to care for employees, but this good intention cannot be achieved even in a socialist society. We can only say that the ambition is commendable.

Therefore, we suggest that the government should study this issue well, improve the rent and management methods, and gradually achieve a reasonable unified distribution at reasonable rents within a few years. At the same time, the housing management departments of various cities should leave a portion of the funds from the rent as a fund for building new houses, so that residential housing can be "self-reliant" and "expand reproduction."

We are also reminded that many industrial and mining enterprises can also use similar methods to retain part of the profits turned over to the state as a fund for expanding reproduction, allowing factories and mines to use it flexibly, which may have a certain positive significance for stimulating production.

The correct solution to the housing policy has an impact on the control of the urban population and therefore on the planning and construction plans of the city.

Regarding Building Materials

Not many varieties; not high quality; many local materials and methods have not been discovered; try to use local materials and waste as much as possible; scientific research should be carried out as soon as possible

IV. We would like to talk about the issue of building materials. Currently, there are these ten words circulating in our construction industry: "Bricks, tiles, ash, sand, stone, reinforced concrete," meaning that our building materials are just these few. Of course, we should also add the two words "wood." It is difficult to meet the needs of socialist construction by simply using these few materials. There are not many varieties of our building materials. There are several new varieties of materials that have been displayed at construction exhibitions, but they have not been mass-produced or officially produced, and they have remained in the stage of sample exhibition year after year, giving the vast number of designers a feeling of quenching their thirst with plums. Many materials are of low quality, and coupled with the rush to complete tasks, quality accidents often occur. The quality of bricks now is also embarrassing. In the past seven or eight years, "a handful of Soviet bricks" and "landing Soviet bricks" have continued to be produced. There are also only two colors of bricks, red and gray. Some of the best traditional building materials, such as beautiful and durable glazed tiles and glazed facing bricks, are not only unable to be used because they remain in the production methods of the Song and Ming dynasties, but are in danger of being eliminated.

On the other hand, many local materials and methods have not been discovered, so that many material problems that can be solved locally in an applicable, economical, and beautiful way have been abandoned, and materials that are not suitable for local conditions have been adopted.

We believe that our material supply situation can be improved. On the one hand, designers should use local materials and methods as much as possible to solve some local building problems. On the other hand, we hope that the production and research departments of building materials can, for the current urgent needs, try to use local materials and waste materials, and use straw, reeds, sawdust, shavings, etc. to manufacture economical and applicable new varieties. At the same time, we must not forget that in order to prepare for the larger-scale socialist construction in the future, and for the standardization of design, the factory production of materials, and the mechanization of construction, we should also carry out scientific research on various plastics, alloys, and other materials and prefabricated components as soon as possible.

For several years, the supply of building materials has been in a state of tension for a long time. One of the reasons is that our annual task plan has not been well coordinated with the production and supply capacity of materials. We suggest that the Economic Commission, the Planning Commission, and the Construction Commission should better consider the scale and tasks of construction based on the production and supply of materials when formulating plans.

Carry out architectural scientific research

The rich experience should be systematically summarized and raised to the theoretical level; it is hoped to create conditions for old architects and old engineers to lead some research work

V. In order to solve the above problems well, architectural workers should carry out research on architectural science. Generally speaking, although past architectural workers have accumulated rich experience in production, they have not systematically summarized and raised it to the theoretical level. Under the call to march towards science, many units have set up research institutions. These institutions are generally very large, with many soldiers and few generals. Many experienced old designers are busy with design tasks and cannot participate in research work; many young comrades, although they have the desire to do scientific research, feel that they do not know where to start due to lack of experience. What they find particularly difficult is the scientific research of urban planning and architectural design, because both of these tasks are a great synthesis of various engineering technologies and arts, and it seems that there is no scientific nature. It is indeed not easy to conduct research on such a highly integrated science. We hope that the leaders of the design department can create conditions for experienced old architects and old engineers so that they can lead some research work while carrying out specific work. At present, many research projects are spread out too much. For example, the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has 888 people, including more than 40 engineers. We very much doubt whether the stall must be spread out like this. Often, research teams with fewer people can achieve good results.

We must learn from the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union has accumulated rich experience in building socialist cities for 40 years and has achieved great success; we should recognize the root causes of glass boxes

VI. We must remember that whether we are carrying out the specific work of planning and design or carrying out scientific research, we must learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has accumulated rich experience in building socialist cities in the past 40 years and has achieved great success in architecture. However, since the Soviet Union criticized formalism and archaism in the past, many of our architectural workers have adopted an attitude of denying everything about Soviet planning or architecture, pushing all the mistakes they had made in dogmatically learning from the Soviet Union in the past onto the four words "learning from the Soviet Union," and in turn imitating Western Europe or the United States in everything. The square boxes that had been criticized in the past have made a comeback. Many designers have not recognized the root causes of glass boxes. On the one hand, it is a manifestation of the severance of history by the decadent capitalist ideology; on the other hand, it is a one-sided exaggeration of mechanical production; on the other hand, it also expresses the artistic ideas of the bourgeoisie. In addition to the issues in ideology that should be debated separately, in terms of the level of productivity alone, imitating it today is using handicrafts to imitate mechanical industry, which is divorced from China's current reality. Of course, we must learn from the good experiences of all countries. But such imitation is still formalistically learning from Western Europe. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The main thing is to learn from the Soviet Union."

Youth ideological education issue

The vast majority are very good, but there are still some young people who are proud and complacent, not humbly learning, and need to strengthen ideological education

VII. Finally, we would like to talk about the issue of youth ideological education and our own transformation. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without a correct political point of view, it is like having no soul." During the Beijing group discussion of this issue, old hero Liu Yingyuan, old artist Mei Lanfang, old doctor Lin Qiaozhi, and old writer Shu Sheyu (Lao She) all mentioned that the vast majority of young people are very good, but some young people become proud and complacent after learning a little skill, compete for treatment, talk about conditions, do not humbly learn from the older generation, and put personal interests ahead of the interests of the country. It is believed that we must vigorously strengthen political and ideological education for young people. We have the same feeling. At present, some graduates of colleges and universities one-sidedly emphasize the unity of learning and application, and are unwilling to make any concessions when assigning work. Those who study urban planning are unwilling to do civil buildings, and those who study civil buildings are unwilling to do industrial buildings. Some young people are ambitious and arrogant, and want to "create" in design units after graduation, unwilling to do construction drawings or partial design, let alone do tracing work. Some young people are determined to march towards associate doctorates, want to reach the world's advanced level in a few short years, want to make a name for themselves, are unwilling to be assistants to old scientists, and do not humbly learn from old scientists. During the rectification movement, some young people, including party and league members, not only lost their way, but also exposed the true colors of right-wingers and attacked the party. The younger generation is our successor. The current political and ideological situation of young people is not very satisfactory.

In the past, we all considered ourselves to be old intellectuals with backward thinking and never asked about youth ideological work, thinking that it was entirely the responsibility of the Party and the League. Now Chairman Mao tells us: "Ideological and political work is the responsibility of every department. ... The principals and teachers of schools should take charge even more." It has been eight years since liberation. On the one hand, we are confident that our level has improved slightly and that we can help the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League shoulder a portion of the responsibility. But on the other hand, we also see that the anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements are all so-called senior intellectuals. We thank the Party for the education it has given us, so that we can distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in this serious class struggle, and not stand on the wrong side. We will do our best to fight back against the rampant attacks of right-wing elements. At the same time, we must check every thought, every word, and every action with the six criteria in the struggle at all times. This anti-rightist movement is more profound in its educational significance for us than the "Three-Anti" and ideological reform movements. We guarantee to resolutely and bravely engage in the battle, and we will never withdraw until we win a complete victory. At the same time, we believe that we will be tempered in the battle, our thinking will be improved, so that we can better serve the great socialist construction and better educate the younger generation.

### 建筑工作者担负着光荣而艰巨的任务  杨廷宝、林克明、朱兆雪、梁思成的联合发言

    建筑工作者担负着光荣而艰巨的任务
    杨廷宝、林克明、朱兆雪、梁思成的联合发言
    我们这一次会议是在第一个五年计划经济建设的最后一年，在中国共产党整风运动的高潮中召开的。我们首先学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，我们以欢欣鼓舞的心情听取了周总理的政府工作报告，薄一波、李先念两位副总理，董院长，张检察长和彭秘书长的报告。我们完全同意这些报告。
    我们四个人都是建筑工作者，从事于城市规划、建筑设计和建筑教育的工作。在祖国的社会主义建设中，基本建设占着很大的比重，而建筑工作，又占基本建设的一半左右。我们感到任务的光荣和艰巨。我们也为八年来祖国在城市规划和建筑上所取得的光辉成就而感到自豪。在党和政府的英明领导下，在苏联和兄弟国家专家的帮助下，广大技术人员和工人完成了或者初步草拟了几十个改建或新建的大中城市的规划；建造了数以千计的各种工业企业的建筑物，包括重型机械、采矿、冶金、各种轻工业的厂房车间建筑；从前不会设计的许多工业建筑，现在也学会了。从一九五二年到一九五六年之间，由国家建造的民用建筑就达一亿四千五百多万平方公尺。这些全国性大规模的建造为生产、为广大人民的生活需要在可能条件下已最大限度地解决了许多迫切的问题。这是中国五千年历史中所从来没有过的。每一个有良心的人都得承认，建筑工作，作为给全面展开的经济、文化建设组织和建造生产、生活的物质空间的工作，如同所有的建设工作一样，八年来的成绩是巨大的。假使没有党的领导，这些成绩之取得是不可能的。铁一般的事实证明，随同生产的飞跃发展，广大职工的劳动环境和生活环境也逐步有所改善了。
    但在另一方面，我们也犯了不少错误，有许多缺点。当然，任何一个事物，都难是尽善尽美的，必然有它的缺点。那些反党、反社会主义的右派分子，利令智昏，从党的整风运动中产生了错觉，以为有机可乘，企图夸大八年来工作中的一些缺点来否定我们的成绩，从而把党搞垮，使资本主义复辟。这不但是六亿人民所绝不容许，而且成绩的本身就是对他们的猖狂进攻的最有力的反击。
    作为八年来献身于建筑工作的技术干部和专业教师，我们没有必要在这里夸耀自己的成绩。为了把今后的工作做得更好，我们更愿检查一下自己的工作，并向党和政府提供一些参考性的意见。
    关于设计标准
    要全面考虑问题，把适用、经济、美观间的矛盾辩证地统一起来
    一、一九五五年批判了铺张浪费的形式主义、复古主义，建筑工作者贯彻了节约的方针，取得了一定的成绩，但由于片面强调节约，又导致了忽视适用和可能的美观的偏向。一九五六年为了纠正这一偏向，又略略把标准放宽了一点，其结果又引起了一定程度的浪费。为什么会出现这样的现象呢？一方面是由于建筑工作者，特别是设计人员未能全面地考虑问题，未能把适用、经济、美观间的矛盾辩证地统一起来。但另一方面，也由于国家的定额标准脱离实际，脱离了我国目前的生产水平和人民的生活习惯，把一些生产力和技术科学先进的国家的标准以及根据人家的生活习惯定出的标准生吞活剥地硬搬过来。不修改这些标准，而单纯从降低单位面积造价上企图节约，这样做是很难，乃至于不可能达到节约的目的的。
    约一个半月以前，国家建委召开了全国设计工作会议，在会议上，李富春、薄一波两位副总理给我们做了重要的指示，并且举出了陕西兴平县和四川某工厂按照地方的生活习惯，利用地方材料、技术和传统，建造了职工认为满意而造价每平方公尺仅仅是六元到十元左右的工人住宅和宿舍，指示我们对过去的标准予以研究，作合理的修改。会议结束已经一个多月了，但是如何贯彻会议的精神和决定，各设计单位还在等待下文。
    两位副总理指示建筑标准必须降低，规范、定额也需要修订，许多设计人员感到自己去订标准规范有困难，还是希望建委能够给一些比较具体的指示。我们建议使用标准特别是民用建筑生活的标准，除了使用面积定额应该由国家严格的掌握以外，可以由各地设计人员按照当地的条件和生活习惯自行拟定。至于结构标准就必须经过科学研究，由国家定出，使设计人员能够在就地取材、因地制宜的原则下，做出确保建筑物安全的设计。
    关于城市规划
    要能很好地作出城市发展分期建设计划；要把文物建筑有机地组织在新城市的规划中
    二、在城市规划方面，两位副总理曾经提到了中小城市不作远景规划而只作近期规划的问题。我们认为城市无论大小都应该有远景规划。过去我们对于规划有错误的认识，只看见远景而没有足够的重视近期，把远景规划当作近期规划作，没有很好地作出城市发展分期建设的计划。因此在建设过程中，就使得建筑分散，不必要地增加了城市建设的投资，造成巨大浪费，给国家带来损失，也给城市居民造成了生活上很大的不便。另一方面，在城市规划中还存在着严重的形式主义，开辟道路，布置街坊，往往不适应当地的自然条件，而用“移山倒海”的大手法去和大自然作吃力不讨好的斗争，造成严重的浪费。这一切错误之产生，亦不是由于做了远景规划，而是因为我们作规划作得不好，只在图纸上划几何图案，关起门打了许多如意算盘，犯了主观主义的错误。我们应该把我们的规划作得更好。我们要使规划能够适应城市近期的发展，同时要使远景规划发生它应有的约束性作用，不使城市乱发展。
    此外在许多旧城市的改建中和在新厂矿的选址和建设过程中，我们认为对于历史遗留下来的文物建筑没有得到应有的重视。例如在北京、西安、洛阳等城市，在规划、选址和建造过程中对于地上和地下的文物虽然已给予一定的重视，但由于对“文物”的认识不太一致，地上的文物建筑很多都被不必要地拆除了；许多地下的历史遗址也被破坏了。有些地方甚至于看中了一些文物建筑的“经济价值”，而忽视了它们更大的、无可补偿的历史、艺术价值，做出了因小失大、“焚琴煮鹤”的事情。河北宝坻县广济寺的一座辽代大殿被拆去修成潴龙河上的公路桥；浙江龙游县的三座宋塔被拆去修公路；北京外城的城墙以及数不尽的县城都因它们的城墙有“经济价值”作为理由之一而被拆除了。吉林省无数县城村镇的庙宇，真正具有还可使用的经济价值的，却又以破除迷信为理由而被拆毁了。广州光孝寺的建筑，在保护文物的正确方针下重修起来，却又在不正确的使用方针下受到了损害。
    许多城市的规划和改建说明，规划人员只把一些文物建筑当作留之无用，弃之可惜的包袱，无可奈何地把它们保存下来，认为它们是城市发展中的绊脚石，恨不得一下子把它们都铲除得一干二净。他们没有认识到许多文物建筑在构成一个城市时的积极因素，没有把它们有机地组织到新城市的规划中来丰富城市居民的生活，来丰富社会主义城市的面貌。问题在于我们城市规划人员是不是能够正确处理城市发展过程中新旧间的矛盾的问题。若能很好地处理，文物建筑就不但不妨碍城市的发展，而且会给城市锦上添花。我们希望文物建筑的问题能够得到地方政府、建设单位和规划设计人员的重视。我们尤其希望得到国务院的重视。
    八年来我们在城市规划工作中已经积累了相当丰富的经验，但是我们对这些经验还没有很好地总结。我们建议城市建设部要把这些经验很好地总结一次。
    关于房屋政策
    应该为生产服务；城市里应适当调整房租，做到以租养房，以租出房
    三、我们想谈一谈同城市规划、城市建设有密切关系的房屋政策问题。我们认为在一个城市里特别是在大城市里把职工住宅宿舍，当作机关的福利设施来办理是不恰当的。城市里的居住房屋应该是城市的一部分而不只是机关企业的一部分。现在许多机关企业的住宅宿舍只收象征性的极少的房租。例如铁道部宿舍，司局长级的每户有房十四间，约二百平方公尺，家具、电话、暖气、热水一应俱全，每月只收房租十元；又如清华大学教授住宅，面积九十多平方公尺算起来租金比铁道部宿舍要贵一倍多，也不过每月收十二元零五分。采用这种包下来的办法不可能不刺激人人带家眷，不可能不鼓励三世同堂、四世同堂。这种房屋政策不是为生产服务而是为消费服务的。这样下去，盖多少房子也不能满足要求。我们的经济建设才刚刚开始转向社会主义、并且离社会主义至少还有两个五年计划的时间距离，而房屋政策却已经差不多进入到各取所需的共产主义世界了。
    拿北京市来说，解放以来已经修建了七百多万平方公尺宿舍。按常理说，国家对于北京市的居住房屋已经可以基本上不再投资就可以解决北京市今后建房的投资问题了。只要适当地调整房租，不仅可以以租养房，并且可以以租生房。资本主义的房产公司就能够以私人资本使房屋生子生孙。我们并不是建议政府要从住宅建筑中取得利润，而是建议把房租略为提高以达到限制农村或小城市的居民，特别是职工的非直系亲属盲目流入城市，加剧城市房屋紧张状态。目前的办法是从对职工的关怀的愿望出发的，但是这个善良的愿望就到了社会主义社会也是达不到的。我们只可以说，其志可嘉而已。
    因此我们建议政府要很好地研究这个问题，改善房租和管理办法，在若干年内逐步做到按合理的租金进行合理的统一分配。同时各城市的房产管理部门应该由房租项下留下部分资金作为新建房屋的基金，使居住房屋“自力更生”，“扩大再生产”。
    我们同时也联想到许多工矿企业也可以用类似的办法，保留部分上缴利润作为扩大再生产的基金，允许厂矿灵活运用，对于刺激生产可能有一定的积极意义。
    房屋的政策正确解决对于城市人口的控制因而对于城市规划和建筑的计划是有影响的。
    关于建筑材料
    品种不多；质量不高；许多地方性材料和方法未被发掘；要尽量就地取材，利用废物；应及早进行科学研究
    四、我们愿意谈谈建筑材料问题。目前我们建筑界流行着这样十个字：“砖瓦灰砂石，钢筋混凝土”，意思就是我们建筑材料就是这几样了。当然，我们还应加上“木头”两个字。单纯用这几种材料是很难满足社会主义建设的需要的。我们建筑材料的品种实在不多。有若干种新的材料品种，在建筑展览会中陈列出来了，但没有大量生产或正式生产，年复一年地停留在样品展览的阶段，使广大设计人员有望梅止渴之感。有许多材料质量不高，再加上施工赶任务，常常出质量事故。现在砖的质量也是使人脸红的。七、八年来，“一把苏”、
  “落地苏”还在继续出窑。砖的颜色也只有红色灰色两种。有些传统的最好的建筑材料，如美观、耐用的琉璃瓦和琉璃面砖，又因停留在宋朝、明朝的生产方法上，不但不能发挥使用，反使有被淘汰的危险。
    在另一方面，许多地方性的材料和方法也未被发掘出来，以致有许多可以既适用、又经济、又美观地当地解决的材料问题被弃置，而采用了不适合当地条件的材料。
    我们认为我们的材料供应状况是可以改善的。一方面，设计人员应该尽可能采用地方材料和方法来解决一些地方性建筑的问题。另一方面，我们希望建筑材料的生产部门和研究部门能够为目前的急需，尽量就地取材，利用废物，用稻草、芦苇、锯末、刨花等等制造经济、适用的新品种。同时，我们也不能忘记，为了将来更大规模的社会主义建设，为了设计标准化、材料工厂化、施工机械化作好准备，我们还应及早进行各种塑料、合金等等材料和预制构件的科学研究工作。
    几年来建筑材料的供应长期处于紧张状态中，其原因之一就是我们的年度任务计划与材料的生产和供应能力未能很好地配合。我们建议经委、计委、建委在制订计划时要更好地根据材料生产和供应情况考虑建设的规模和任务。
    开展建筑科学研究
    要把丰富的经验加以系统的总结，提高到理论水平；希望给老建筑师和老工程师创造条件，领导一些研究工作
    五、为了很好的解决上面这些问题，建筑工作者应该对建筑科学开展研究工作。一般说来，过去的建筑工作者虽然在生产中积累了丰富的经验，但是没有加以系统的总结提高到理论水平。在向科学进军的号召下，许多单位设置了研究机构，这些机构一般都很庞大，兵多将少，许多有经验的老设计人员忙于设计任务不能参加研究工作；许多年青的同志虽然有做科学研究的志愿，但因缺乏经验，感到不知从何下手。他们所感到尤其困难的是城市规划和建筑设计的科学研究，因为这两种工作都是各式各样的工程技术和艺术的大综合，看来好像没有什么科学性。对于这样高度综合性的科学进行研究的确不是容易的。我们希望设计部门的领导同志能给有经验的老建筑师和老工程师创造条件，使他们在进行具体工作的同时也能领导一些研究工作。目前许多研究工作的摊子摆得太大。例如建筑工程部的建筑科学研究院就有八百八十八人，其中工程师四十余人，我们很怀疑摊子是否必须这样铺张。往往人数比较少的研究小组就可以作出很好的成绩。
    我们必须学习苏联
    苏联四十年来积累了丰富的建设社会主义城市的经验，取得很大成就；应该认识到玻璃方匣子产生的根源
    六、我们必须记住，无论进行规划设计的具体工作或是进行科学研究，我们都必须学习苏联。苏联在过去四十年中积累了丰富的建设社会主义城市的经验，在建筑方面也取得了很大的成绩。但是自从苏联批判了过去一个时期中的形式主义、复古主义后，我们的建筑工作者中就出现了不少人对于苏联的规划或建筑采取否定一切的态度，把自己过去教条主义地学习苏联所犯的错误，一下子都推到“学习苏联”这四个字上去，反过来一切都摹仿西欧或美国。过去被批判过的方匣子又卷土重来了。许多设计人员没有认识到玻璃方匣子产生的根源。一方面它是腐朽的资本主义思想割断历史的表现，一方面又是片面地夸大机械生产的表现，一方面还表现了资产阶级的艺术思想。除了在思想意识上的问题应该另外争辩外，单就生产力水平来说，我们今天去摹仿它就是用手工业去摹仿机械工业，是脱离中国当前的实际的。当然，一切国家的好经验我们都要学习。但是这样去摹仿还是形式主义地学习西欧。我们必须记住毛主席的教导：“主要的还是学习苏联”。
    青年思想教育问题
    绝大多数都很好，但还有一些青年骄傲自满，不虚心学习，需要加强思想教育
    七、最后我们想谈谈青年的思想教育问题以及我们自己的改造问题。毛主席教导我们说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。在北京小组讨论这一问题的时候，老英雄刘英源代表，老艺人梅兰芳代表，老大夫林巧稚代表，老作家舒舍予（老舍）代表都谈到绝大多数青年都很好，但也有些青年学会了一点本领就骄傲自满，争待遇，讲条件，不虚心向老前辈学习，把个人利益放在国家的利益的前头。认为必须大力加强对青年的政治思想教育。我们也有同感。目前有些高等学校的毕业生片面强调学用一致，在分配工作时不肯丝毫迁就。学习城市规划的就不愿意做民用建筑，学习民用建筑的就不愿意做工业建筑。有些青年好高骛远，自高自大，毕业后在设计单位中就想“创作”，不愿做施工图或局部设计，更不用说做描图的工作了。有些青年一心想向副博士进军，想在短短几年内就达到世界先进水平，想一鸣惊人，不肯做老科学家的助手，不虚心向老科学家学习。在整风运动中，还有些青年，包括党、团员在内，不仅迷失了方向，而且暴露出来右派的真面目，向党进攻。青年一代是我们的接班人。目前青年的政治思想情况是不太令人满意的。
    过去，我们都自认为自己是旧知识分子，思想落后，对于青年思想工作从来不过问，认为那完全是党、团的责任。现在毛主席告诉我们：“思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。……学校的校长教师更应该管。”解放已经八年了，一方面我们自信，水平已略有提高，我们是能够帮助共产党和青年团负起一部责任的。但在另一方面，我们也看到反党、反社会主义的右派分子，清一色地都是所谓高级知识分子。我们感谢党给我们的教育，使我们在这一场严重的阶级斗争中能辨是非，分清敌我，没有站错立场。我们将以全力反击右派分子的猖狂进攻。我们同时也要在斗争中时时刻刻用六项标准检查自己的每一思想，每一句话，每一行动。这一次反右派的运动对我们的教育意义比“三反”和思想改造运动还深刻得多。我们保证要坚决勇敢地投入战斗，不获全胜，决不收兵。同时我们相信，我们在战斗中将得到锻炼，思想将得到提高，使我们能更好地为伟大的社会主义建设服务，更好地教育青年一代。
