Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 13th: Sofia newspapers published on the 12th the decision of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers on improving the work of the People's Assembly and giving play to the initiative of the working people.

The resolution stipulates further expansion of the powers of the People's Assembly. The resolution points out that the People's Assembly has been greatly strengthened under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government and has become a prestigious organ of state power. However, there are still many shortcomings in its work, which are primarily related to the remaining bureaucratic leadership and management methods, limitations in giving play to initiative, and lack of support for the masses and their experience and creativity.

Therefore, the resolution believes that in order to further improve the work of the People's Assembly, it is necessary to greatly expand its powers in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, expand the scope of issues it deals with, and transfer some enterprises, affairs, and institutions of local significance that are now under central jurisdiction to its leadership and management.

The resolution stipulates that the People's Assembly should have the right to prepare its own budget so that it has the funds and the possibility to organize and implement measures related to economy, public facilities, and public health, and can make better use of budget revenues to more fully meet the needs of local residents.

At the same time, the resolution believes that it is also necessary to expand the power of the district People's Assembly in preparing and approving various construction plans for the district, so as to enable it to more effectively solve local problems and better utilize the potential of the working masses.

The resolution also stipulates some measures to improve the work of the People's Assembly and expand its power.
