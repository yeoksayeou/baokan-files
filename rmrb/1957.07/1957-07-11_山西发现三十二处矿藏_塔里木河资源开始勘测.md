Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 10th. The seven geological survey teams dispatched by the Shanxi Office of the Ministry of Geology have discovered thirty-two mineral deposits in Shanxi Province. The survey reports on these mineral deposits are expected to be submitted within the year.

After departing in April of this year, the seven survey teams conducted surveys in the Lüliang Mountains and Wutai Mountains areas of Shanxi. The data obtained from the surveys over the past four months indicate that the ore bodies in the Lüliang Mountains and Wutai Mountains are complex and extensive, with obvious mineral outcrops, and contain a variety of mineral deposits. Currently, these seven survey teams are still searching for treasures in the mountains above 2,000 meters above sea level, and they will submit reports on the mineral deposits discovered in these four months before the start of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 10th. Our reporter Tan Feng reports: The comprehensive survey of water and soil resources of the Tarim River, China's longest inland river, which traverses the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, has begun. Survey personnel are braving the summer heat of the vast desert and advancing from west to east along the middle reaches of the Tarim River. Topographic surveyors are measuring the terrain conditions on the desolate northern bank. Soil survey teams have already conducted surveys on tens of millions of acres of virgin wasteland here. To ensure the smooth progress of the survey work, the survey team will also conduct an aerial survey over the Tarim River. The survey work is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

The comprehensive survey of the Tarim River is the first step in the large-scale development of the Tarim River basin, which will begin next year. According to existing data and preliminary plans of the leadership, starting from the Second Five-Year Plan, nearly ten million acres of wasteland on both sides of the Tarim River will be reclaimed into arable land, an area approximately equal to one-third of Xinjiang's current total cultivated land. Starting next year, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army will reclaim one million to three million acres on the south bank of the middle reaches.

The focus of the comprehensive survey of the Tarim River basin is concentrated in the narrow strip of land extending over 500 kilometers from Aksu County, where the Yarkand River, Aksu River, and Hotan River converge in the upper reaches, to Weili County. The lower reaches of the Tarim River, which are included in the Kaidu River basin plan, were surveyed last year. The middle reaches of the Tarim River have fertile land and abundant water resources, making them highly valuable for development. Since last year, wasteland survey personnel have preliminarily surveyed and explored more than ten million acres of wasteland along the 500-kilometer stretch of the riverbanks. Most of these wastelands have been alluvial for many years, resulting in relatively low salt content, and can be planted with crops such as cotton without or with simple improvement. In terms of water resources, every summer and autumn, the melting snow from the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains results in a large amount of water flowing from the Aksu River, Yarkand River, and other rivers into the Tarim River. If some reservoirs are built to store the floodwaters, it can be guaranteed that the nearly ten million acres of arable land to be developed will receive sufficient irrigation. At the same time, the banks of the Tarim River have extremely favorable conditions for growing cotton. The temperature is high, the sunshine duration is long, and the frost-free period is about 200 days. With little rain throughout the year, this is an ideal area for cultivating cotton, especially long-staple cotton, in our country.

The Tarim River is China's longest inland river, bordering the vast Taklamakan Desert to the south and the Tianshan Mountains stretching for thousands of miles to the north. It meanders more than 2,000 kilometers from west to east, traversing the Tarim Basin. The wilderness along the riverbanks, nourished by the river water, is filled with groves of parasol trees and various wild hemp and aquatic plants, resembling a green ribbon stretched across the Taklamakan Desert. In the middle and lower reaches, there is a grassland and lake area more than 100 li wide, where herders of various ethnic groups often graze cattle and sheep. However, in the past, no rulers ever managed the Tarim River. Most of the water seeped and overflowed into the desert. In addition, due to the obstruction of the vast desert and inconvenient transportation, the banks of the Tarim River were very desolate, with few traces of humans, and only various wild animals roamed in the dense grass and forests.

### 山西发现三十二处矿藏  塔里木河资源开始勘测

    山西发现三十二处矿藏  塔里木河资源开始勘测
    新华社太原10日电　地质部山西办事处派出的七个地质普查队，已经在山西境内发现了三十二处矿藏。这些矿藏的普查报告，预计在年内可以提交出来。
    这七个普查队在今年4月出发后，在山西的吕梁山和五台山地区进行了普查。四个月中进行普查获得的资料说明，吕梁山和五台山矿体纵贯复杂，矿苗吐露明显，有多种矿藏。现在，这七个普查队还在拔海二千公尺以上的大山里找寻宝藏，他们要在第二个五年计划开始前，提出在这四个月中发现的矿藏的报告。
    新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　本社记者谈凤报道：横贯新疆塔里木盆地的我国最长内陆河——塔里木河的水土资源综合勘测工作已经开始，深入到河两岸的勘测人员正冒着大沙漠的夏季酷暑在塔里木河中游自西向东前进；地形测量员测量着荒无人烟的北岸地形状况；土壤调查队已经在这里上千万亩原始荒地上作了勘察。为使勘测工作顺利进行，勘测队还要在塔里木河两岸上空进行一次航测。勘测工作预计在今年年底结束。
    全面勘测塔里木河是明年开始的大规模开发塔里木河流域工作中的第一步。根据已有的资料和领导部门的初步计划，从第二个五年计划开始，塔里木河两岸将有近千万亩荒原被开垦为良田，它的面积约等于新疆目前全部耕地的三分之一。人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团从明年开始，就要在中游南岸垦荒一百万亩到三百万亩。
    塔里木河流域综合勘测的重点，集中在从上游的叶尔羌河、阿克苏河及和阗河汇流的阿克苏县到尉犁县的五百多公里的狭长地带，列入开都河流域规划中的塔里木河下游已在去年进行了勘测。塔里木河中游土地肥沃、水源充足，开发价值很大。荒地勘测人员从去年以来，在这五百多公里长的沿河两岸已经概查和踏勘出一千多万亩荒地，这些荒地大部分经过多年的洪水冲积，盐分比较轻，不经过改良或经简单改良即可种植棉花等作物。水源方面，每年夏秋两季，天山和昆仑山积雪融化后，从阿克苏河、叶尔羌河等河流注入塔里木河的水量很大，如修建一些水库把洪水拦蓄起来，就可保证要开发的近千万亩耕地得到足够水量的灌溉。同时，塔里木河两岸在种植棉花方面有着极为优越的条件，这里气温高，日照期长，无霜期达二百天左右，加以终年很少阴雨，是我国栽培棉花，特别是栽培长绒棉的理想地区。
    塔里木河是我国最长的内陆河，南面是浩瀚的塔克拉玛干大沙漠，北临绵延几千里的天山，自西而东，蜿蜒二千多公里，横穿塔里木盆地。沿河两岸的荒野，由于得到河水的滋润，梧桐成林，野麻和各种水草丛生，真像横在塔克拉玛干大沙漠中一条绿色的锦带；中下游有一百多里宽的草湖地带，附近各族牧民常在这里放牧牛羊。但是过去历代统治者从未治理过塔里木河，大部分水都渗透和漫流到沙漠里去了，加上大沙漠的阻隔、交通不便，塔里木河沿岸十分荒凉，很少见到人的足迹，只有各种野兽出没在乱草丛林中。
