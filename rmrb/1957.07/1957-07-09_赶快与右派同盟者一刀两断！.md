Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: Pan Dakui and Yang Yitang initially changed their vague attitude and were willing to make specific explanations. Tan Tiwu confirmed Huang Shaohong's reactionary remarks and actions in provoking youth to oppose the Party and the government.

The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued its group discussions this morning.

Many groups refuted various fallacies of the rightists in their discussions; some representative groups discussed the various reports of this conference and put forward some opinions and suggestions on the work of the government.

Pan Dakui, a member of the Luo Longji clique, made a self-criticism at the Sichuan Provincial Representative Group meeting today, exposing Luo Longji's attempt to oppose China's leaning-to-one-side diplomatic line with his hoped-for "pro-American middle road." Pan Dakui specifically talked about the way Luo Longji's so-called invisible organization carried out its activities. He said, "Factional conspiracies certainly exist now, but the form has changed, from centralized to decentralized. Their conspiratorial goal is to use intellectuals as capital to contend with the Party. The method is to distort communication and use their positions to spread plausible but false information. In this way, people in the small group receive instructions and return to their localities to carry out their instructions." Pan Dakui said, "I am one of those who participated in their sectarian and conspiratorial activities, and I responded to their ideas and implemented their opinions in Sichuan."

The Jiangsu Provincial Representative Group continued to criticize the anti-socialist words and deeds of Chu Anping, Fei Xiaotong, and Qian Weichang today. Chen Zhongjing urged Chu, Fei, and Qian to pay serious attention to the situation and seize the opportunity to bravely break with their allies of yesterday and expose them. Chu Anping, Fei Xiaotong, and Qian Weichang all said that they would speak at the group meeting tomorrow and explain specific new things.

In the Shanghai Representative Group, Yang Yitang, Qian Duansheng, and Lin Handa all made self-criticisms at the group meeting today. Yang Yitang initially changed his vague attitude of the past few days and was unwilling to make specific explanations. He exposed the ugly history of Zhang Bojun's consistent bragging and political speculation. When talking about Zhang Bojun's recent conspiracy to expand his influence and "recruit soldiers and buy horses" everywhere in the past year, Yang Yitang said that after the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward in 1956, Zhang Bojun became very energetic. He said that the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party would develop hundreds of thousands of members in a few years. He wanted to establish organizations in all provinces and important cities throughout the country, and even develop them to the county level. To cooperate with the large-scale organizational development, Zhang Bojun wanted to establish a cadre department in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party on the one hand, and decided to publish a semi-monthly magazine called *Progress*, and also to run an academic publication called *Zhonghua Forum*, with himself as the editor-in-chief. He planned to invite Zhang Shenfu, He Zhongmin, and others to be the editors of this publication, and wanted the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to reserve five places for *Zhonghua Forum* within its organizational structure. Yang Yitang said that during the national working conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in March this year, Zhang Bojun loudly called out: "Now is the time for organizational independence and political freedom, and we are in charge!" Yang Yitang also said that Zhang Bojun himself had said: "There is strength with a group, and power is obtained with strength. Even selling out becomes more valuable." Yang Yitang said that Zhang Bojun clearly wanted to sell the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to capitalism.

Tan Tiwu confirmed at the Hunan Provincial Representative Group meeting today that Huang Shaohong had secretly told the rightist Lin Xiling about the wrongly judged cases in judicial work and the cases of starvation deaths in the Pingle Special Zone of Guangxi before the government announced them. Huang Shaohong also asked Lin Xiling to go to his house to look at the case files. Tan Tiwu said that Huang Shaohong, as a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, asked a person who had nothing to do with the Standing Committee to look at the national case files, attempting to provoke the youth to oppose the Party and the government. Tan Tiwu also confirmed some of Huang Shaohong's other reactionary remarks and actions. She said that after inspecting judicial work in Zhejiang and Shanghai, Huang Shaohong believed that judicial work was extremely dark, and that he had done a lot of "good deeds" for counter-revolutionaries by reviewing their cases, interrogating them, and learning about their situations at their homes. Tan Tiwu also said that Huang Shaohong had an ambiguous relationship with Luo Longji and Huang Qixiang. Huang Qixiang and Huang Shaohong had very close relations. Many representatives from Hunan Province welcomed the attitude taken by Tan Tiwu today and hoped that she would continue to explain.

Representative groups from Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and other places continued to put forward opinions and suggestions on the work of the government in today's group discussions.

Representative groups from Guangxi, Gansu, and other places discussed the report made by Vice Premier Ulanhu on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Representatives of all ethnic groups in the two groups unanimously agreed to the State Council's proposal to the current Congress regarding the establishment of these two autonomous regions. The Guangxi delegation, which came to Beijing to report on the discussions of the Zhuang Autonomous Region by all sectors of Guangxi, sent its deputy head, Lin Hu, vice chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to attend the group meeting of the Guangxi representative group today. According to Lin Hu's report, 74 of the 75 cities and counties in Guangxi Province have convened people's congresses, and the vast majority of representatives enthusiastically support the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. They hope that the National People's Congress will approve this proposal as soon as possible and begin the specific preparatory work for the establishment of the region.

Representative groups from Liaoning, Gansu, Hebei, Fujian, and other provinces conducted discussions on the election of deputies to the next National People's Congress this morning.

    赶快与右派同盟者一刀两断！
    潘大逵、杨逸棠初步改变含含糊糊不愿具体交代的态度
    谭惕吾证实黄绍竑挑拨青年反对党和政府的反动言行
    据新华社8日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午继续分组讨论。
    许多小组在讨论中驳斥了右派分子的各种谬论；有些代表小组讨论了这次会议的各项报告，对于政府工作提出了一些意见和建议。
    罗隆基小集团成员之一的潘大逵今天在四川省代表小组会上作了检讨，揭发了罗隆基企图用他所希望的“亲美的中间路线”，来反对中国一边倒的外交路线。潘大逵具体谈了罗隆基所说的无形组织进行活动的方式。他说，“宗派阴谋现在肯定是有，不过形式改变了，由集中变成分散。他们的阴谋目的就是想利用知识分子作为与党分庭抗礼的本钱。而方法就是歪曲传达，利用他们的地位散布似是而非的消息，这样，小集团中的人接受了指示，回到地方就按照他们的指示进行工作。”潘大逵说，“我就是参加了他们这样性质的宗派和阴谋活动的一人，并且我在四川也就响应了他们的主张，执行了他们的意见。”
    江苏省代表小组今天继续批判储安平、费孝通和钱伟长的反社会主义的言行。陈忠经要储、费、钱三人严重注意，应抓紧时机勇敢地与昨天的同盟者一刀两断，揭露他们。储安平、费孝通和钱伟长都说，他们明天将在小组会上发言，交代具体的新的东西。
    在上海代表小组，杨逸棠、钱端升、林汉达今天都在小组会上作了检讨。杨逸棠初步改变了他前几天含含糊糊不愿具体交代的情况，揭露了章伯钧一贯招摇撞骗进行政治投机活动的丑恶历史。在谈到章伯钧最近一年来阴谋扩张势力，到处“招兵买马”的情况时，杨逸棠说，1956年“长期共存，互相监督”方针提出后，章伯钧的劲头可大了，他说农工民主党在几年内要发展几十万党员。他要全国各省、各重要城市都建立组织，一直发展到县城地方。为配合组织大发展，章伯钧一方面想在农工民主党中央成立干部部，一方面决定出版前进报半月刊，还要办一个学术性的刊物，定名为“中华论坛”，他自己来做总编辑。他准备请张申府、何仲珉等当这个刊物的编辑，并要农工民主党编制内为“中华论坛”留下五个名额。杨逸棠说，今年3月间农工民主党开全国工作会议时，章伯钧大声疾呼说：“现在是组织独立、政治自由，我们自己当家作主了！”杨逸棠还说，章伯钧自己说过：“有团体而后有力量，有力量而后取得权力，就是出卖也值钱些。”杨逸棠说，显然，章伯钧想把农工民主党出卖给资本主义。
    谭惕吾今天在湖南省代表小组会上证实，黄绍竑曾把司法工作中错判案件和广西平乐专区饿死人的案件在政府没有公布的时候，就暗暗告诉了右派分子林希翎。黄绍竑还让林希翎到他家去看案卷。谭惕吾说，黄绍竑身为全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，叫一个与常委职务无关的人去看国家案卷，是企图挑拨青年反对党、反对政府。谭惕吾还证实了黄绍竑的其他的一些反动言行。她说，黄绍竑在视察浙江、上海的司法工作之后，认为司法工作异常黑暗，并认为他自己替反革命分子翻案卷、提讯反革命分子和到反革命分子家里了解情况，是替他们作了很多“好事”。谭惕吾还说，黄绍竑和罗隆基、黄琪翔关系暧昧。黄琪翔和黄绍竑来往很密切。湖南省许多代表对谭惕吾今天所采取的态度表示欢迎，并希望她继续交代。
    陕西、新疆等代表小组在今天的小组讨论中，继续对政府工作提出意见和建议。
    广西、甘肃等代表小组讨论了乌兰夫副总理所作关于建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的报告。两个组的各族代表一致同意国务院关于建立这两个自治区向这次大会提出的提案。来北京汇报广西各界讨论僮族自治区情况的广西代表团，今天派副团长、政协广西省委员会副主席林虎列席了广西代表小组的小组会。据林虎报告，目前广西省七十五个市县中，已有七十四个市县召开过人民代表大会，绝大多数代表都热烈拥护成立广西僮族自治区。他们希望全国人民代表大会从速批准这项提案，并开始建区的具体筹备工作。
    辽宁、甘肃、河北、福建等代表小组，今天上午就下届全国人民代表大会代表的选举问题进行了讨论。
