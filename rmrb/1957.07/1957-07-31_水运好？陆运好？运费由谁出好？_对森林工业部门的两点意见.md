    Is Water Transportation Better? Or Land Transportation? Who Should Pay the Freight?
    Two Suggestions for the Forestry Industry Department
    Liu Zhijie
    For a long time, the forestry industry system has had disagreements on several business policies. I believe it is now time to resolve these issues from the perspective of increasing production and practicing economy.
    (I)
    The first issue is the development of narrow-gauge forest railways and the full utilization of natural conditions.
    As early as 1952, the Wumin River Forestry Bureau in the Lesser Khingan Mountains of Northeast China built a forest railway along the river where timber was being transported. From 1953 onwards, most of the timber produced by this bureau was transported by forest railway. By 1954, the rivers originally used for timber rafting were completely abandoned. At the same time, the Shuangzi River Forestry Bureau in the Lesser Khingan Mountains also built a forest railway along the river. As a result, a wave of abandoning rivers and building forest railways quickly swept across the various forestry bureaus in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. The proportion of water transport in the entire timber transportation of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia has decreased from 28.4% in 1953 to 9.2% in 1956. Forestry bureaus that had not built forest railways considered themselves to be "backward." In order to achieve the goal of building forest railways, some adopted the method of "gradual progress," first building flatcar tracks (small railways without power), and then reporting to the higher authorities, saying that "it would not take much investment to convert the flatcar tracks into forest railways." They adopted such methods to gradually "create conditions" until the rivers were finally abandoned.
    In 1953, the responsible comrades of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Forestry pointed out that this practice was unreasonable, and many employees also opposed it, but some comrades still insisted on doing so. Why were they so enthusiastic about abandoning rivers and building railways? It is understood that there were such reasons: river transportation of timber is highly seasonal, production is characterized by crash programs, completing tasks is stressful, and it is not as balanced as railway transportation, making it more certain to complete tasks; China's technology for river transportation of timber is backward, and it is not as easy to manage as railway transportation. Some comrades are unwilling to actively find ways to overcome these difficulties, but find many reasons to try to prove that developing forest railway transportation of timber is more cost-effective than utilizing natural conditions.
    In fact, most countries in the world transport timber by natural river rafting. In larger countries, the proportion of water transport still accounts for more than 60% of the total timber transportation volume. Canada is a major timber exporting country, but it has only two forest railways in the whole country. In Finland, Norway, and the United States, where the forest industry is relatively developed, there are also very few forest railways. Because forest areas are mostly near water, natural rafting is always more cost-effective than building railways. Especially at present, China's steel production is insufficient, and places where steel can be avoided should be avoided as much as possible, so as to use steel in the most urgent needs. Building one kilometer of forest railway requires 30 tons of steel rails. Building more forest railways will add more difficulties to the country. China has a long history of river transportation of timber, and there is a lot of experience among the people. As long as these experiences are summarized and promoted, the potential for water transportation of timber is great.
    (II)
    The second issue is that there is a great deal of detailed accounting to be done for the on-site transportation costs and off-site transportation costs of timber.
    According to regulations, the timber supplied by the forestry industry department to timber-using units is delivered along the railway line, that is, the timber yard is set up along the railway line as the delivery location, and the timber-using units go to the timber yard to pick up the timber themselves. The cost of transporting timber from the mountains to the timber yard is borne by the forestry industry department, and the cost of transporting timber from the timber yard to the timber-using location is borne by the timber-using unit. The former is called on-site transportation cost, and the latter is called off-site transportation cost. China's timber is all allocated by the state in a unified manner, and timber-using units cannot freely purchase it on the market. In this way, the amount of off-site transportation costs depends on the forestry industry department that supplies the timber. However, among the various work indicators of the forestry industry department, there is no item for reducing off-site transportation costs, so they have not regarded how to reduce timber off-site transportation costs as their regular responsibility. What they are most concerned about is how to shorten the on-site transportation distance and reduce on-site transportation costs, so as to reduce costs. In order to shorten the on-site transportation distance and reduce on-site transportation costs, they often move the timber that should have continued to be transported in the river to the shore and put it into the timber yard as early as possible, turning part of the original on-site transportation into off-site transportation, and changing water transportation to land transportation. In this way, for the country, it not only increases a large amount of useless expenditure (because train freight is much more expensive than water transportation), but also increases the tension of railway transportation. For example, most of the timber in the Xiangjiang River basin of Hunan Province was transported to Hankou by waterway for sale before liberation, but now many timber yards have been set up along the railway line, and the timber in the river is moved to the shore, loaded onto trains, and transported to Wuhan. The timber along the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi Province used to be transported through Zhangshu, through Poyang Lake, and into the Yangtze River to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, but now the timber is moved to the shore in Zhangshu, and then loaded onto trains and transported to Shanghai. This serious waste has not been discovered for a long time because the forestry industry department does not have this account.
    My views on these two issues may not be correct. However, I hope that the forestry industry department can study and solve these problems as soon as possible.

    水运好？陆运好？运费由谁出好？
    对森林工业部门的两点意见
    刘之杰
    长期以来，森林工业系统在几个业务方针上意见不一致。我认为，现在是按照增产节约的观点来解决这些问题的时候了。
    （一）
    第一个问题，是发展窄轨森林铁路和充分利用自然条件的问题。
    早在1952年，东北小兴安岭的乌敏河森林工业局就沿着正在运输木材的河流修筑了森林铁路。从1953年起，这个局生产的大部分木材就改由森林铁路运输。到1954年，原来流送木材的河流就被完全废弃了。与此同时，小兴安岭的双子河森林工业局也沿着河流修了森林铁路。于是，很快地就在东北各地和内蒙古的各个森林工业局掀起了废河流修森林铁路的浪潮。在整个东北地区和内蒙古的木材运输中，水运任务的比重已经由1953年的28.4％降低到1956年的9.2％。没有修上森林铁路的森林工业局，就认为自己“落后”了。为了达到修筑森林铁路的目的，有的就采取“循序渐进”的办法，先修平车道（无动力的小铁道），然后再给上级打报告，说“用不了多少投资就可以把平车道改为森林铁路”。他们就采取这样的办法，一步步地“创造条件”，直到最后把河流废弃。
    1953年，林业部计划司的负责同志就曾指出这种作法不合理，许多职工也反对这种作法，但是有些同志仍坚持要这样作。为什么他们这样热衷于废河流修铁路呢？据了解，有这样一些理由：河流运送木材季节性强，生产突击性大，完成任务紧张，不如铁路运输均衡，完成任务有把握；我国通过河流运送木材的技术落后，不如铁路运送好管理。有些同志不愿意去积极设法克服这些困难，却找出许多理由来，企图证明发展森林铁路运木材比利用自然条件合算。
    实际上，世界各国运输木材大都利用河流自然流送。比较大的国家，但水运比重仍占整个木材运输量的60％以上。加拿大是木材出口比较多的国家，全国却只有两条森林铁路。在芬兰、挪威和美国等森林工业比较发达的国家，森林铁路也很少。因为森林区大都临水，自然流送总是比修铁路要合算。特别是目前我国钢材生产不足，能够不用钢材的地方就应该尽量不用钢材，以便把钢材用在最迫切需要的地方。修一公里森林铁路需要三十吨钢轨，多修些森林铁路，就为国家多增加一些困难。我国河流运送木材的历史很悠久，在民间有很多经验，只要把这些经验加以总结和推广，水运木材的潜力是很大的。
    （二）
    第二个问题，是木材的场内运输费和场外运输费大有细账可算。
    森林工业部门供给用材单位的木材，按规定都是在铁路沿线交货，就是把贮木场设在铁路沿线作为交货地点，用材单位自己到贮木场去取木材。把木材由山林运到贮木场的费用由森林工业部门负担，把木材由贮木场运到用材地点的费用由用材单位负担。前者叫场内运输费，后者叫场外运输费。我国木材都是由国家统一调拨的，用材单位不能在市场上自由购买。这样，场外运输费用的多少就取决于供应木材的森林工业部门。但是，在森林工业部门的各项工作指标中，并没有降低场外运输费用这一项，他们也就没有把如何降低木材场外运输费用当作自己经常的责任。他们最关心的是如何缩短场内运输距离，减少场内运输费用，以便降低成本。为了缩短场内运输距离，减少场内运输费用，他们就常常把本来应该在河里继续运输的木材尽早搬到岸上放进贮木场，把原来的一部分场内运输变成场外运输，把水运改成陆运。这样，对国家来说，不但增加了很大一笔无益的开支（因为火车运费比水运贵得多），而且增加了铁路运输的紧张状况。例如，湖南省湘江流域的木材，解放以前大部分是由水路运往汉口出售，而现在却沿着铁路设立了许多贮木场，把河里的木材搬上岸，装上火车，运往武汉。江西省赣江沿岸的木材一向是经过樟树走鄱阳湖入长江运往南京、上海等地，现在却在樟树就把木材搬上岸，然后装上火车运往上海。这种严重的浪费，因为森林工业部门没有这笔账，所以长期没有被人发现。
    我对这两个问题的看法不一定正确。但是，希望森林工业部门能够及早研究解决这些问题。
