Various newspapers will strengthen propaganda against rightists

    This newspaper reports: Beijing journalistic circles unanimously support this newspaper's July 1st editorial, "The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized."

    Many staff members of the Ta Kung Pao editorial department said after reading the editorial, "Now the direction of running the newspaper is clearer." The person in charge of the editorial department told reporters that because Ta Kung Pao is a newspaper transforming from capitalism to socialism, the newspaper has been reborn and its people have been reformed since liberation. However, the old remnants have not been completely overcome, and the old ideas and styles lurking in the depths of people's souls often emerge at important junctures. In the past few years, Ta Kung Pao has repeatedly made mistakes. In exposing internal contradictions among the people and publicizing the Party's rectification campaign, some reporters and editors were nostalgic for the old Ta Kung Pao, demanding the restoration of the old Ta Kung Pao's "free world" and wanting to run Ta Kung Pao as a "cooperative newspaper," which led to many problems. He cited examples such as the recent publication of "The Empty Interview Trip to Inner Mongolia" which was wrong; the news about the exchange of houses in Beijing did not match the facts; and the news about Beijing's cancellation of the free vegetable market was even more煽动性. These mistakes are worth further examination. The person in charge finally said that they are preparing to mobilize all staff members of the editorial department to discuss the People's Daily editorial, deeply examine the newspaper's work, establish a correct ideological style, and run a good socialist newspaper.

    Many staff members of Guangming Daily repeatedly read the editorial. They told reporters that the editorial has greatly encouraged them to improve Guangming Daily and truly make it a socialist newspaper. They will continue to thoroughly examine the work of the editorial department in accordance with the spirit of the editorial, and correct the errors and shortcomings brought to Guangming Daily by the reactionary ideas of Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping. In order to strengthen the propaganda of the anti-Rightist struggle, some units of the editorial department have already held meetings to re-arrange the current propaganda of the anti-Rightist struggle, and some have begun to study how to improve the layout of the newspaper.

    The person in charge of China Youth Daily told reporters that in this fierce class struggle, the People's Daily played the leading role of the Party newspaper, awakening everyone at a time when understanding was somewhat vague. He said that all staff members of China Youth Daily will study the editorial in depth. Because most of the staff members of the Youth Daily are young intellectuals, who are enthusiastic and energetic, but lack experience in class struggle, lack theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and lack knowledge and experience of actual life. In addition, the leadership once one-sidedly emphasized improving business, boldly creating, and bravely innovating, resulting in the phenomenon of only paying attention to anti-dogmatism and neglecting anti-revisionism. This criticism of the bourgeois direction of Wenhui Daily by the People's Daily has given us a great education, and we must study relevant documents well, carry out rectification well within the newspaper, and ensure that we do not make serious mistakes in the future.

### 各报将加强反对右派分子的宣传

    各报将加强反对右派分子的宣传
    本报讯　北京新闻界人士对7月1日本报社论“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”一致表示拥护。
    大公报编辑部许多工作人员读了这篇社论以后，都说：“这一下办报的方针更加明确了”。编辑部负责人对记者说，由于大公报是一张由资本主义向社会主义转化的报纸，在解放以后，报纸经过新生，人经过改造，可是旧的残余还没有完全克服掉，潜伏在人们灵魂深处的旧思想旧作风，每到重要关键往往浮现出来。在过去几年当中，大公报曾经屡犯错误。在揭露人民内部矛盾，宣传党的整风的过程中，一部分记者、编辑留恋旧时期的大公报，要求恢复旧大公报的“自由天地”，要把大公报办成“同人报纸”，于是出了不少毛病。他举例子说，最近登出的“内蒙古采访扑空记”是错误的；有关北京市调换房屋的消息与事实不符；关于北京市取消蔬菜自由市场的消息更带有煽动性。这些错误，值得我们作进一步的检查。这个负责人最后说，他们准备发动编辑部全体人员讨论人民日报这篇社论，深入地检查报纸工作，树立正确的思想作风，办好一张社会主义的报纸。
    光明日报许多工作人员反复阅读了这篇社论。他们对记者说，这篇社论对改进光明日报，把光明日报真正办成一张社会主义的报纸，起了极大的鼓舞作用。他们将根据社论精神继续深入检查编辑部的工作，纠正章伯钧、储安平的反动思想给光明日报带来的错误和缺点。为了加强反右派斗争的宣传，编辑部有的单位已经开会重新布置了当前反右派斗争的宣传，有的并开始研究改进报纸的编排工作。
    中国青年报负责人对记者说，在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，人民日报发挥党报的领导作用，在大家认识多少模糊的时候，一下子把人点醒。他说，中国青年报的全体工作人员将要深入地学习这篇社论。因为青年报的工作人员大多是知识青年，有热情，有朝气，但是缺乏阶级斗争经验，缺乏马克思列宁主义的理论知识，缺乏实际生活知识和经验，加上领导上过去一度片面强调改进业务，大胆创造，勇敢革新，造成只注意反教条主义，忽视了反修正主义的现象。这次人民日报对文汇报资产阶级方向的批判，给我们很大教育，我们一定要很好地学习有关文件，在报社内很好地进行整风，保证今后不犯严重的错误。
