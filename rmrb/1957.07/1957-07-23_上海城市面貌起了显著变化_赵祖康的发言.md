I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the work reports of other leading comrades.

During the conference, reading Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has profoundly educated me on how to study Marxism-Leninism more diligently in the future and serve socialism more actively under the leadership of the Party. The following are some of my thoughts on Shanghai's municipal construction and studying Chairman Mao's speech, in connection with my work.

Achievements in Shanghai's Municipal Construction

In the past eight years since liberation, Shanghai's municipal construction has been carried out under the guiding principle of serving production and the working people, and it has been successful, resulting in significant changes in many aspects of Shanghai's cityscape.

First, one of the key focuses of Shanghai's municipal construction has been the development and renovation of new and old industrial zones and the construction of workers' residential areas. The roads, transportation, water supply, and drainage in Shanghai's existing major industrial zones have been improved. In addition, several new industrial zones, such as Taopu and Pengpu, have been developed or are under development, arranging factories of different natures separately, which will play a coordinating role in implementing the policy of fully utilizing and rationally developing Shanghai's industrial production.

Since 1951, Shanghai has started to invest in the unified construction of employee housing by the government and encourage factories and enterprises to invest in the construction separately. By the end of last year, a total of over 1.8 million square meters had been built, accommodating 300,000 people (excluding those built by employees themselves or with "self-construction with public assistance"). The employee housing is distributed in twelve residential areas, located near the new and old industrial zones and the Pudong area, covering an area equivalent to about one-tenth of Shanghai's original built-up area. Most of the houses are two or three stories high, and a small number are four stories high, with dormitory-style and apartment-style options, all equipped with water, electricity, and sanitation facilities, adapting to Shanghai's climate, geographical conditions, and residents' living habits. The residential areas have considerable green space, with plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the children are very healthy. Each area is also equipped with elementary schools, kindergartens, nurseries, clinics, shops, vegetable markets, post offices, etc. Public bus routes pass through or are close to these residential areas. After moving into the areas, the employees recalled the miserable conditions of living in dilapidated boats by the Suzhou River, in small, dark attics, or in crumbling shacks, and then looked at the comfortable and good housing and environment they now live in. They realized the unexpected happiness brought to them by the socialist system. They thanked the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and realized that only the Party and the People's Government can seek happiness for the working people. Their enthusiasm for production has become even higher.

Second, the opening of main roads and the improvement and expansion of public transportation services in Shanghai have also achieved significant successes in the past eight years. The following are some examples of newly opened main roads: From the North Railway Station (passenger terminal) and the East Railway Station (freight terminal), there are now widened or newly opened wide roads that lead directly to several industrial zones in the east and west of the city and the bustling central area of Nanjing Road. These wide "roads" were something the Kuomintang reactionary rule tried hard to open but never succeeded in, but they quickly became a reality in the hands of the people. This year, two traffic arteries are being opened in the northern and southern districts of the built-up area: in the northern district, a large reinforced concrete overpass is being built across the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, allowing buses and trolleybuses to pass on the bridge and railway transport vehicles to pass under the bridge, striving to be completed before National Day this year; in the southern district, a north-south trunk road is being built in the old city, passing through the central district to connect with the North Railway Station, which is expected to be completed next spring.

Shanghai's public transportation service is mainly based on buses and trolleybuses. The existing transportation lines have increased by 337 kilometers compared to before liberation, mainly to facilitate transportation between industrial zones and residential areas, as well as between built-up areas and suburbs. Measures for route adjustments are also being actively carried out recently. There are currently more than 1,300 buses and trolleybuses, an increase of 43 percent compared to before liberation, but the average daily passenger rate of public transportation in the city currently reaches 3 million, and there is still a large need to increase vehicles. The Jiefang-brand bus and Jiefang-brand trolleybus have been successfully trial-produced, and 130 vehicles are planned to be manufactured this year, with the required assemblies, parts, and materials basically all being domestically produced.

Third, in the past few years, a considerable amount of basic construction has also been carried out in Shanghai's water supply (tap water) and drainage (ditch) projects. The tap water pipelines have increased by 365 kilometers, playing a "circular flow" role; in terms of ditches, 170 kilometers of ditches and pipes have been added (excluding alley ditches), and many new flood control pumping stations and sewage treatment plants have been built. Dozens of stinking creeks in the built-up area have also been filled in, reducing the threat of flooding after rain in some frequently flooded areas, and greatly improving environmental hygiene. In addition, in the past few years, more than 200 environmental hygiene projects have been carried out in shantytowns where a large number of working people live, such as repairing small roads, laying drainage pipes, and setting up public water supply stations and public toilets, benefiting nearly one million working people.

Fourth, gardens and greenery have also developed rapidly. Among them, constructions of special significance include the transformation of "racecourse" into People's Park, the transformation of "golf course" into West Suburb Park, and the filling of Zhaojiabang into a tree-lined avenue; also, the Bund, which was dirty and ugly before liberation, has been transformed into a riverside street park with green trees and red flowers, becoming a beautiful gateway to the new Shanghai; these are all things that the people of Shanghai should be proud of.

In short, the old Shanghai, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial city that was called "adventurers' paradise" by imperialists before liberation, is now being transformed by the people under the leadership of the Party into a new Shanghai, a "paradise for the working people."

Cannot Tolerate the Rampant Attacks of Rightists

The achievements of Shanghai's municipal construction are only a relatively unimportant part of the magnificent achievements of our country's economic recovery and the great socialist construction of the First Five-Year Plan since liberation; however, the people living in Shanghai and those from all over the country, especially international visiting friends and general tourists, have seen some vivid facts of Shanghai's municipal construction, and have seen the different contrasts between the new atmosphere of the new Shanghai and some of the remaining features of the old Shanghai, and all can't help but be surprised and admired. Then, when people see or hear about the huge scale and rapid speed of our entire country's achievements in developing the national economy during the First Five-Year Plan, their excitement and admiration for our Party and country is even greater. However, since the Communist Party welcomed the democratic parties and non-party people to help the Party in the rectification campaign, a small number of people with ulterior motives have created an evil wind and a demonic wind, confusing people and attempting to realize their sinister schemes. These are the poisonous, insidious, despicable, and filthy absurd remarks and activities spread and plotted by those bourgeois rightists. Those rightists, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi, such as Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and in Shanghai, such as Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, Wang Zaoshi, Sun Dayu, and Lu Yi, exaggerated the shortcomings in our work and denied our achievements. They completely pushed the subjective reasons for these shortcomings onto the Party organization or Party members, forgetting their own responsibilities. They also maliciously attributed these shortcomings to the basic system of the country; starting from these distorted arguments, they communicated with each other, coordinated in various places, and issued all kinds of arrogant political propositions and absurd remarks with programs, organizations, and plans to usurp the Party's leadership, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, and take the capitalist road, and carried out criminal activities against the Party, against the people, and against socialism. The main reason why these absurd words and deeds occurred is that their position is fundamentally wrong. They do not stand on the highest interests of the 600 million people, but on their own small group's position of competing for fame and profit, launching a rampant attack on our vast people, on our beloved Party, and on our socialist adherence. We cannot tolerate this under any circumstances. We are angry, and we hate them!

We solemnly warn this small group of rightists: our great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the basic system of our socialist country, guarantee the increasing unity and consolidation of our country, and guarantee the victory of our socialist revolution and construction. Therefore, our country will inevitably achieve successes in all aspects of its work, and the successes are the main thing. The rightists deny our achievements and oppose the Party and socialism. They are blind to Mount Tai!

We say that there are achievements, and that the achievements are the main thing, but we do not deny that there are shortcomings in the work, or that individual mistakes sometimes occur, although they are secondary. There are also shortcomings or errors in Shanghai's municipal construction work in recent years. As far as my own work is concerned, whether in the development of industrial zones or workers' residential areas, whether in the standards of certain constructions, or in the scale of urban planning, shortcomings or errors have occurred to varying degrees. Looking for the reasons, Chairman Mao pointed out most clearly in his speech, which gave me great enlightenment.

Transform Thinking, Improve Work Style, and Improve Systems

Chairman Mao said that the existence of bourgeois ideology, the existence of certain bureaucratic work styles in state institutions, and the existence of defects in certain aspects of the state system contradict the socialist economic base; we must solve these contradictions according to the specific situation. This valuable pointer really startled me and brightened my eyes, and further recognized the root causes of the shortcomings or errors in my past work. Because, aren't bourgeois ideology and bureaucratic work styles still quite serious in me? And are not the defects in certain aspects of the several systems related to my work, in addition to the limitations of my own abilities and objective conditions, also related to my ideology and work style?

The transformation, improvement, and improvement of ideology, work style, and systems are closely related to our future work, which will be done more, faster, better, and more economically. In the final analysis, it is still a matter of ideological transformation, that is, the issue of our intellectuals continuing to transform themselves and continuing to advance, as Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech. Chairman Mao said: "We hope that the intellectuals in our country will continue to advance, gradually establish a communist worldview in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually become one with the workers and peasants, and not stop halfway, let alone retreat backward, there is no way out to retreat backward." This is truly benevolent, sincere, and earnest teaching. However, a small group of rightists with political ambitions are deliberately retreating backward, retreating to reaction, and dragging others back with them; they harm themselves and others, oppose the Party and harm the country, and their crimes are great. The vast majority of our intellectuals have been educated, trained, united, and helped by the Party in the past few years, and are grateful and strive to transform and advance. We must not coexist peacefully with those ungrateful, unconscionable rightists who harm the people and endanger the Party and the country; we must draw a clear line, stand firm, discern right from wrong according to Chairman Mao's six political criteria, and wage a resolute struggle against the rightists, expose and refute their absurd words and deeds, and give them a severe counterattack. We will never give up until they bow their heads to the Party and the people and confess their mistakes and crimes!

We must actively participate in the struggle to counterattack the rightists, train ourselves to become soldiers with the same thoughts and feelings as workers and peasants, unite more closely under the leadership of the Party, and make more contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    上海城市面貌起了显著变化
    赵祖康的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和其他各位首长的工作报告。
    会议中，读到毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演文件，对我在今后更认真地学习马克思列宁主义，更积极地在党的领导下为社会主义服务具有极其深刻的教育意义。以下请允许我联系工作谈谈上海市的市政建设和学习毛主席讲演的一些体会。
    上海市政建设的成就
    解放八年来，上海的市政建设在为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针下进行工作，是有成绩的，因而也使上海的城市面貌在不少方面起了显著的变化。
    第一，上海市政建设的重点之一，是新旧工业区的开辟、整理和工人住宅区的兴建。上海原有几个主要工业区的道路交通给水排水等都有改进。此外，并已经开辟或正在开辟桃浦、彭浦等几个新工业区，分别安排不同性质的工厂，对于贯彻执行上海工业生产的充分利用、合理发展的方针，是能起配合作用的。
    一九五一年起，上海市开始由政府投资统一建造并鼓励工厂企业投资分别建造职工住宅，至去年底止共达一百八十余万平方公尺，可住三十万人（职工群众自行建造和“自建公助”的未计在内）。职工住宅分布在十二个住宅区，分别接近新旧工业区及浦东地区，占地共约合上海市原有建成区面积的十分之一。住宅多数是二层或三层楼房，一小部分是四层，有宿舍式，有公寓式，都安装有水电卫生设备，适应了上海的气候、地理条件和居民的生活习惯。住宅区内都有相当面积的绿地，空气阳光充足，孩童身体都很健壮；各区还配合建造了小学、幼儿园、托儿所、门诊所、商店、菜场、邮局等；公共汽车路线都通过或接近这些住宅区。职工们迁住入区内后，回忆到过去住在苏州河边破船里或矮小阴暗的阁楼里或摇摇欲坠的棚屋里的凄惨景况，再看看现在所处舒适良好的住屋和环境，都体会到社会主义制度给他们带来梦想不到的幸福，他们感谢中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，认识只有党和人民政府才能为劳动人民谋幸福。他们的生产热情更高涨了。
    第二，上海的干道道路的开辟和公共交通服务事业的改进与扩展，八年来也有显著的成就。新辟干路可举以下几个例子：从铁路北站（客运总站）和东站（货运总站）出来，现在已经有拓展或新辟的宽阔道路可直达本市东西几个工业区和南京路一带的热闹中区了。这些宽阔“马路”，在国民党反动统治时期花了很大气力想开而始终开不成的，到人民的手里很快就成为事实。今年还在建成区的北区和南区分别开辟交通干道各一条：在北区是跨越沪宁铁路的一座钢筋混凝土大旱桥，桥上可通行公共汽车及无轨电车，桥下通行铁路运输车辆，今年国庆节前可争取完工；在南区是在旧城厢辟筑一南北干路，北经市中区以通北火车站，可望于明春完工。
    上海的公共交通服务事业是以公共汽车和有轨无轨电车为主。现有交通线路较解放前增加了三百三十七公里，主要是为便利工业区与住宅区间以及建成区与郊区间的交通，最近尚在积极进行线路调整的措施。现有公共汽车和电车共一千三百余辆，较解放前增加百分之四十三，但目前本市公共交通平均每天的乘客率达三百万人次，仍有大量增加车辆的需要，现已试制成功解放牌公共汽车和解放牌无轨电车，今年准备造一百三十辆，所需总成、配件与材料基本上全部为国产。
    第三，给水（自来水）排水（沟渠）工程的基本建设，几年来在上海也兴办的很不少。自来水管线增加了三百六十五公里，发挥了“环流”的作用；沟渠方面增设了沟管一百七十公里（里弄沟渠未计在内），新建了防洪唧站及污水处理厂多处，还填没了建成区内臭水浜几十处，对某些经常积水的地区减少了一雨即淹的威胁，对环境卫生有不少改进。此外，几年来在劳动人民居住特多的棚户区内举办修理小路，排设沟管，设置公共给水站、公厕等环境卫生工程，有二百余处，受益的劳动人民近一百万人。
    第四，园林绿化也发展的较快。其中具有特殊意义的建设有如“跑马厅”改建为人民公园，“高尔夫球场”改建为西郊公园，肇嘉浜填成为林荫大道；还有解放前肮脏丑恶的外滩改建为绿树红花的滨河街头游园，成为新上海美丽的大门；这些都是值得上海人民引为骄傲的。
    总之，在解放前半封建半殖民地的旧上海，帝国主义者称之为“冒险家的乐园”的，现在是在党所领导的人民手里改造成为“劳动人民的乐园”的新上海了。
    不能容忍右派分子猖狂进攻
    上海市政建设的成就，仅仅是解放以来八年期间我们国家进行经济恢复和第一个五年计划的伟大的社会主义建设取得辉煌成就中比较地还不顶重要的一个部分；但是居住在上海的和来自全国各地的人民，尤其是国际访问友人和一般旅行游览的人，看到了上海市政建设的一些活生生的事实，看到了新上海的新气象和旧上海一些残余面貌的不同的对比，都莫不情不自禁地惊奇赞叹。那末，人们看到或听到我们整个国家发展国民经济第一个五年计划的巨大规模及飞跃速度的成就，他们心情上的激动和对我们党与国家的敬佩和赞美，是更不用说的了。但是自从共产党欢迎各民主党派及党外人士对党帮助整风之后，竟有一小部分居心叵测的人制造出一股邪风、妖风，淆惑人心，企图实现他们的阴谋诡计，这就是那些资产阶级右派分子散布出来和阴谋进行的恶毒阴险卑鄙龌龊的荒谬言论和活动。那些右派分子如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器之流，如民革的龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾之流，在上海如陈仁炳、彭文应、王造时、孙大雨、陆诒之流，他们夸大我们工作中的缺点，而否定我们的成绩，他们把产生这些缺点的主观原因完全推在党组织或党员身上，而忘掉了自己应负的责任，他们还把这些缺点恶意地归咎于国家的基本制度；从这些歪曲的论点出发，他们彼此相通，各地配合，有纲领、有组织、有计划地发出篡夺党的领导权、反对人民民主专政、走资本主义道路的种种狂妄的政治主张和荒谬言论，并进行反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动。这些荒谬言行之所以产生，主要是由于他们的立场是根本错误的。他们不站在六亿人民的最高利益的立场上，而站在他们自己一小撮人的争名夺利的立场上，向我们广大人民、向我们所爱戴的党、向我们所坚持的社会主义作猖狂的进攻，我们是万万不能容忍的。我们愤怒，我们憎恨他们！
    我们正告这一小撮右派分子：我们的伟大的、正确的、光荣的中国共产党，我们的社会主义国家的基本制度，保证了我们国家日益统一和巩固，保证了我们的社会主义革命和建设的胜利，因而我们国家在各个方面的工作都必然能取得成绩，而且成绩是主要的。右派分子否定我们的成绩，反对党，反对社会主义，是有眼不识泰山！
    我们说有成绩，说成绩是主要的，并不否认工作中有缺点，或者有时还产生个别错误，虽然它们是次要的。上海市几年来的市政建设工作，也存在着缺点或错误。就我自己的工作而言，不论在工业区或工人住宅区的开辟，不论在若干建设的标准方面，不论在城市规划的规模方面，都曾经或多或少产生过缺点或错误。推其原因，毛主席在讲演中指点得最明白，给了我很大的启示。
    改造思想，改进作风，健全制度
    毛主席说，资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的；我们必须按照具体的情况，解决这些矛盾。这一宝贵的指点，真使我心里一惊，眼前一亮，进一步认识了过去工作中缺点或错误的病根所在。因为，资产阶级的意识形态和官僚主义的作风，在我不是都还相当严重的存在着吗？而和我工作有关的若干制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，除了由于自己能力及客观条件的限制以外，也不还是和我的意识形态与作风有关吗？
    意识形态、作风、制度三者需要改造、改进和健全，对于我们今后更多、更快、更好、更省的做工作，是有密切关系的，而归根到底，还是一个思想改造问题，也就是毛主席在讲演中指出的我们知识分子的继续改造自己、继续前进问题。毛主席说：“我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”这真正是仁慈真挚语重心长的教导。但是，一小撮政治野心家的右派分子却偏偏在向后倒退，退向反动，而且拖别人一同向后倒退；他们害己害人，反党祸国，罪恶很大。我们绝大多数的知识分子都是几年来得到党的教育培养、团结帮助而感激不尽、力图改造前进的人，同那些忘恩负义、没有良心、危害人民群众、危害党和国家的右派分子决不能和平共处；我们必须划清界限，站稳立场，依据毛主席的六项政治标准，明辨是非，对右派分子作坚决的斗争，揭发并驳斥他们的荒谬言行，予以严厉的反击，不到他们向党、向人民低头认错认罪，决不罢休！
    我们要在积极投入反击右派分子的斗争中，锻炼自己成为具有同工人农民一样的思想感情的战士，更紧密地团结在党的领导下，为社会主义革命、社会主义建设作出更多的贡献。
