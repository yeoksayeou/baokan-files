    Refuting "No-Law Theory"
    Xia Zhifeng

    Huang Shaohong believes: The current situation is one of "lawlessness" and "no law to follow."

    Wang Zaoshi said: The current situation is one of "emphasizing rule by men, and neglecting rule by law."

    This is clearly "anesthetic." If you don't believe me, look:

    "Just taking the regulations compiled by the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council, we have nearly four thousand regulations."

    "We have reviewed the judgments of the courts and the indictments of the procuratorates. It should be said that, with the exception of a very few wrongly judged cases, the vast majority are handled in accordance with the law." (See Li Zuyin's speech at the symposium in the legal community in the Guangming Daily on June 22)

    In the eyes of the rightists, these laws cannot be called laws, and solving problems according to these laws cannot be called the rule of law. Only something like what Luo Longji proposed, setting up a committee to encourage everyone to "appeal grievances," can be considered "law" and "rule of law."

    Don't think that these rightists raise the so-called "law" issue with good intentions, wanting everyone to act according to the law. "The drinker's heart is not in the wine;" their real intention is to use the name of "rule of law" to restrict the people's hands and feet.

    I think, suppose Huang Shaohong were entrusted to draft a regulation on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, I guarantee that the first article would be "no mass struggle." In Huang Shaohong's view, mass struggle belongs to the category of "lawlessness." Of course, this kind of thing can only be hypothetical. To put it bluntly, Mr. Huang may not even agree with things like suppressing counter-revolutionaries. There is evidence: Huang Shaohong spoke many times at the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, advocating that the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries campaigns should be redone from scratch, saying that there were great errors in each movement, and grabbing a few wrongly judged cases, he said that they were fundamentally wrong, putting forward the provocative slogan of so-called "rehabilitating unjust cases." In fact, the so-called "no law to follow" is just a more charming way of saying it.

    The people need law—building socialism is a major law, but not the kind of law Huang Shaohong is talking about. The law that the people need is a law that is conducive to uniting the people of the whole country to carry out socialist construction, a law that is conducive to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is also our purpose in making laws. From this standard, isn't our constitution a very complete law? Aren't our thousands of regulations laws? Isn't acting in accordance with the constitution and these thousands of regulations true rule of law, rather than the deliberately created "rule of law" by people like Huang Shaohong?

    Huang Shaohong and others' "no-law theory" and "light rule of law theory" are a slander against our current legal system, indicating that these people have two completely opposite positions from the broad masses of the people. If we act according to these people's interpretation of the law, then the Southern Tyrants, Northern Tyrants, and the like should all "turn over," and the masses who struggled against the Southern Tyrants and Northern Tyrants would all be "breaking the law." This kind of law is pleasing to Huang Shaohong's bourgeoisie and landlord bullies, but the broad working people will never allow it to appear.

    斥“无法论”
    夏之风
    黄绍竑认为：现在是“无法无天”、“无法可依”。
    王造时说：现在是“重人治，轻法治”。
    这明明是“蒙汗药”。不信请看：
    “就拿国务院法制局整理汇编的法规来说，我们就有了近四千种法规”。
    “我们检查过法院的判决书和检察院的起诉书，应该说，除了极少数的错判案件外，绝大多数都是依法办事的”。（见6月22日光明日报李祖荫在法学界座谈会上的谈话）
    在右派分子看来，这些法都不能叫做法，按照这些法去解决问题都不能叫法治，只有如罗隆基所提的什么成立一个委员会去鼓励大家“申诉委屈”之类，才算做“法”和“法治”。
    不要以为这些右派分子提出所谓“法”的问题，真是安了什么好心，要大家依法办事。“醉翁之意不在酒”，他们的真正企图，是在乎借“法治”之名，行束缚人民手脚之实。
    我想，假设委托黄绍竑去拟一个镇压反革命条例，管保第一条是“不许群众斗争”，在黄绍竑看来，群众斗争就是属于“无法无天”之列的。当然，这种事情也只好假设假设，说穿了，如镇压反革命这一类的事本身，黄先生就未必是同意的。有例可证：黄绍竑在“人大”常委会上好多次发言，主张把三反、五反和肃反从头来搞过，说每次运动都有很大错误，并且抓住几件错案就说根本搞错了，提出挑拨性的所谓“平反冤狱”的口号。实际上，所谓“无法可依”之类，只不过换了一个更容易迷人的说法罢了。
    人民需要法——建设社会主义这就是一条大法，但是不需要像黄绍竑说的那种法。人民需要的法，是要利于团结全国人民进行社会主义建设的法，是要利于巩固无产阶级专政的法，这也才是我们订法的目的。从这个标准看，那么，我们的宪法不就是很完备的法么？我们的几千种法规不就是法么？按照宪法、按照这几千种法规办事，不也就是真正的法治，而不是如黄绍竑等人所制造出来的别有用心的“法治”么？
    黄绍竑等人的“无法论”“轻法治论”是对我们现在法制的一个污蔑，表明了这些人和广大人民有着两个完全相反的立场。按照这些人对法的解释去办事，那么什么南霸天、北霸天之类，就都该“翻身”了，而斗争南霸天、北霸天的群众呢，也就都是“犯法”的了。这种法虽为黄绍竑资产阶级和地主恶霸所喜，但广大劳动人民却决不会容许它出现。
