The idea of discrimination against Traditional Chinese Medicine has begun to reverse, but erroneous opinions still exist

Since the criticism of Comrade He Cheng's erroneous ideology in 1955, the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine has been rectified in health work. Ideas of belittling, discriminating, excluding, and attacking Traditional Chinese Medicine have begun to reverse, the political status of Traditional Chinese Medicine has been raised, and the enthusiasm of Traditional Chinese Medicine has been further brought into play. Not only for many chronic diseases, but even in the treatment of many infectious diseases, many cases across the country have proven that Traditional Chinese Medicine has good curative effects, and it has made certain contributions to safeguarding people's health. This shows that the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine is correct and great, and I sincerely support it.

However, after the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, especially in the recent period when the Party proposed rectification and asked non-Party members to help with rectification, one could often see or hear some heartbreaking erroneous remarks from newspapers or symposiums. They said: "The theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine is unscientific," "The curative effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine is also unscientific," "High school graduates learning Traditional Chinese Medicine is misleading people," "The policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine has overcorrected, and Traditional Chinese Medicine has been elevated too high." Some even said: "He Cheng was right, just too激烈," and some even said that uniting Chinese and Western medicine is inappropriate.

It is not difficult to see that the emergence of these erroneous remarks is by no means accidental. Their speeches are not directed at Traditional Chinese Medicine, but at the Party Central Committee. In essence, they are opposing the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Everyone can see clearly that the 500,000 Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners across the country have only received due respect under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is the protector, cultivator, and promoter of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Without the leadership of the Party and the policies on Traditional Chinese Medicine formulated by the Party, there would be no talk of inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. As during the period when He Cheng led health work, there was a real danger of loss and extinction.

We must clarify right and wrong. Is there an error in the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine, or is there an error in the thinking of some health workers? Or is there an error in the Traditional Chinese Medicine policy, or is there an error in the health department that implements the Traditional Chinese Medicine policy? I believe that the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine is completely correct, without any errors, and the root cause of the error lies on the one hand in the fact that some health workers have ideological problems, and on the other hand in the fact that the health department also has problems in implementing the Party's policy.

I suggest that the Party organization of the Ministry of Health thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of He Cheng.

We should face the reality. Because the criticism of He Cheng's ideology was poorly carried out in the health department, and some units did not even carry out the criticism at all, the erroneous ideas similar to those of Comrade He Cheng have not been corrected among many health workers. They are only temporarily hidden under the loud call for earnestly implementing the Traditional Chinese Medicine policy, and therefore will raise their heads again at a certain period, forming a confrontation with the Party's policy. This shows that the health department was weak in leading the criticism of He Cheng's ideology in the past, lacked courage and魄力, and failed to thoroughly eliminate the erroneous ideological influence of Comrade He Cheng among all health workers, thereby truly laying the ideological foundation for implementing the Traditional Chinese Medicine policy, and thus brought harm to the development of Traditional Chinese Medicine work. On the other hand, it also shows that if health workers do not truly transform their bourgeois ideology and use temporary concealment methods, it will not work. Bourgeois ideology will raise its head at any time and any place. Therefore, I suggest that the Party organization of the health department should make up for the lesson in the rectification movement, and from within the Party to outside the Party, should gradually and thoroughly eliminate bourgeois erroneous ideology. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost.

Since the criticism of He Cheng's ideology, the Ministry of Health has been actively implementing the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine, and is willing to do a good job in Traditional Chinese Medicine work in its subjective wishes, and has indeed made certain achievements in Traditional Chinese Medicine work. Compared with the period when He Cheng led health work, there has been a fundamental change. This is a good side that should not be obliterated objectively; however, on the other hand, due to the influence of subjectivism, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and vacillation and procrastination in the leadership of the Ministry of Health, the Traditional Chinese Medicine work has not achieved the due results, and even many shortcomings and errors have occurred.

The work of Western medicine doctors studying Traditional Chinese Medicine needs to consider the characteristics of the two academic systems in order to be promoted smoothly.

Western medicine doctors learning Traditional Chinese Medicine is a key issue in inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. When the Ministry of Health carried out the work of Western medicine doctors learning Traditional Chinese Medicine, I don't think it took into account the characteristics of the two different academic systems of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western medicine very well. It was carried out a bit too fast and with too many people. According to my understanding, the two-year full-time training class has the best results, and it is easy to implement the policy of systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, sorting out, and improvement. Many Western medicine doctors who have undergone systematic study for two years and combined it with clinical practice have not only eliminated their erroneous understanding of Traditional Chinese Medicine, but have developed a strong feeling for traditional Chinese medicine, believing that the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine has many simple dialectical materialistic principles, and its treatment rules or laws have scientific principles, but lack the explanation of modern science, which is precisely the glorious task that Western medicine doctors should undertake after learning Traditional Chinese Medicine. Therefore, I believe that the work of Western medicine doctors learning Traditional Chinese Medicine should focus on the two-year full-time training class, and continuously improve and improve it on the existing basis. If the two-year full-time training class is successful, then the on-the-job training class cannot but be a failure. Trying to achieve the same purpose and requirements for different situations and different objects with the same content and method, this kind of subjective approach divorced from reality will inevitably lead to the failure of the work. Learning any kind of academic is continuous, especially learning Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as the on-the-job training class, which is exposed to the sun for one day and frozen for ten days, and cannot be combined with clinical practice, it is difficult to talk about the effect of learning. Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine must be closely combined with clinical practice, because the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine can only be understood through clinical practice, its mystery and its important role in guiding practice, otherwise, just gnawing on books will not produce any results. Didn't Yu Yunxiu gnaw many Traditional Chinese Medicine books without combining them with clinical practice to deeply understand and study them, and as a result, didn't he negate Traditional Chinese Medicine and think that Traditional Chinese Medicine is unscientific? There are many reasons for the failure of the on-the-job training class. I think the main reason is that there is an error in the learning method itself, which cannot learn the rules well or learn to treat diseases. The three-year time drags on for too long. It should be decisively changed, completely transformed according to the principle of voluntariness and the actual situation, and quickly changed into various forms, and no longer passively continue.

Since the four Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges have been opened, leadership should be strengthened

Obviously, it was a bit hasty to open four Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges at the same time without sufficient preparation. Since they have already been opened, we should make up our minds, make great efforts, and run the existing four Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges well. I think the most central issue at present is to strengthen leadership, strengthen teachers, and strengthen equipment, strengthen teaching leadership, improve teaching quality and effectiveness, so that students can indeed learn well. However, I do not agree with the fallacy that Traditional Chinese Medicine colleges are run wrongly. In their bones, they still negate the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, which is a manifestation of national nihilism.

The Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute has been established for almost two years, with more than 600 cadres, including about 170 Western medicine doctors, about 60 Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors, and the rest are general cadres. From the short period of two years, we should not make excessive demands on the work achievements of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, but the work achievements of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute are indeed unsatisfactory. I think the crux of the problem of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute is that it is superficially complying with the Party's Traditional Chinese Medicine policy, but violating it in reality, and has not implemented it, so it has not been able to correctly formulate the direction, tasks, research steps, and work plan of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute in accordance with the spirit of the Party's policy and guidelines for a long time. Even some anti-Traditional Chinese Medicine remarks have openly raged in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute, and the facts of attacking Traditional Chinese Medicine have also appeared in affiliated hospitals. Therefore, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute must be rectified. Not only should the organizational structure and staffing be adjusted and streamlined, but more importantly, ideological consensus should be sought on the Party's policies and guidelines, and ideological rectification should be carried out in order to lay a correct foundation for future work.

In addition, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine apprenticeships, Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors participating in hospital work, etc., I think there are achievements, but there are also problems. Overall, the main shortcomings and errors of the Ministry of Health in implementing the Traditional Chinese Medicine policy, I think, are that there is impetuosity, carelessness, insufficient investigation and research, poor in-depth inspection, especially poor in solving problems in a timely manner, causing Traditional Chinese Medicine work to suffer undue losses, which is precisely due to the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism of the leadership. But we will never allow the achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine work to be obliterated because there are shortcomings and errors in Traditional Chinese Medicine work. I think the achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine work are basic, and the shortcomings and errors are secondary. This is not dogmatism. Because the shortcomings and errors in Traditional Chinese Medicine work are generated in the process of development and progress, and are fundamentally different from the errors when He Cheng led health work. Therefore, after the leadership of the Ministry of Health overcomes the three isms, these shortcomings and errors can be corrected and improved.

Finally, I want to remind everyone to be vigilant. There are ambitious elements hidden in the health team. They are trying to seize the Party's leadership over health work. They have spread many malicious remarks. Some people say that the Communist Party does not understand science and technology, and laymen cannot lead experts; others say that the prevention and treatment units that are tightly grasped by the Party committee or Party group are particularly backward in science and technology; others say that none of the ministers of the Ministry of Health are Western medicine experts, so health work is a mess; some even advocate that the medical alliance should conduct examinations for cadres, and those who fail the academic test should step down; others say that nothing in Soviet medicine is advanced, for example, we say that the protection of medical care and painless childbirth is very good, but they also deny it. There are countless such malicious remarks. We should pay attention that those who make these malicious remarks are precisely those who call themselves great intellectuals and great scientists, and have close ties with the Zhang-Luo alliance. I hope that all health workers will draw a clear line from these ambitious right-wing elements ideologically and politically, and resolutely fight back against them.

### 党的中医政策是完全正确的  卫生部执行这个政策有毛病  王文鼎的发言

    党的中医政策是完全正确的  卫生部执行这个政策有毛病
    王文鼎的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的报告和李德全部长的发言。我现在就中医工作问题，发表我个人的看法和意见。
    歧视中医的思想开始扭转，但谬误言论仍存在
    卫生部门自一九五五年批判了贺诚同志的错误思想后，党对中医工作的政策才在卫生工作中摆正了。轻视、歧视、排斥和打击中医的思想开始有了扭转，中医的政治地位提高了，中医的积极性有了进一步的发挥。不但对于很多慢性病，即使在不少传染病的治疗上，全国各地已有许多事例证明中医有很好的疗效，在维护人民健康上曾作出一定的贡献。这说明了党对中医工作的政策是正确、伟大的，我是竭诚拥护的。
    但是，在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针提出后，特别是在最近时期党提出整风，请党外人士帮助整风后，从报纸上或座谈会中经常地可以看到或听到一些使人痛心的谬误言论。他们说：“中医理论是不科学的”，“中医有疗效也不科学”，“高中毕业生学中医是误人子弟”，“中医政策矫枉过正了，把中医抬得太高了”。甚至还有人说：“贺诚做的是对的，只是激烈了些”，甚至更有人说团结中西医太不恰当。
    不难看出，这些谬误言论的出现决不是偶然的，他们的发言并不是针对着中医，而是针对着党中央，实质上他们是在反对党的中医政策。谁都看得清楚，全国五十万中医是在中国共产党领导下才受到应有的尊重。中国共产党是祖国医学遗产的保护者、培植者和发扬者，没有党的领导和党所制定的中医政策，祖国医学遗产是谈不上继承和发扬的。如在贺诚领导卫生工作的时期，却真有散失灭绝的危险。
    必须弄清是非，究竟是党所制定的中医政策有错误，还是有些卫生人员的思想有错误呢？抑或是中医政策有错误，还是执行中医政策的卫生部门有错误呢？我认为党所制定的中医政策是完全正确的，丝毫没有错误的，而产生错误的根源，一方面是在于有些卫生人员思想上有问题，另一方面是在于卫生部门执行党的政策中也有毛病。
    建议卫生部党组织彻底清除贺诚的思想影响
    应当正视现实，由于贺诚思想批判在卫生部门中开展得很差，甚至有些单位根本就没有开展批判，因而在不少卫生工作人员中和贺诚同志相类似的错误思想并未得到纠正，仅只是在认真贯彻中医政策的高呼声中暂时隐伏下去，因而到了一定的时期就又会抬起头来，形成和党的政策的对抗。这说明了卫生部门过去对开展贺诚思想批判领导无力，缺乏勇气和魄力，在全体卫生工作人员中彻底清除贺诚同志的错误思想影响，为贯彻中医政策真正奠定思想基础，因而给开展中医工作上带来了危害；另一方面也说明了卫生工作人员如果不将资产阶级思想真正加以改造，而用一时的隐蔽的方法是行不通的，资产阶级的思想是随时随地都会抬起头来的。因此，我建议卫生部门党的组织应在整风中进行补课，从党内到党外，应当逐步彻底清除资产阶级错误思想。亡羊补牢，犹未为晚。
    卫生部自贺诚思想批判后，是在积极地贯彻党对中医工作的政策，在主观愿望上也是愿意把中医工作搞好的，并且在中医工作中也确实作出了一定的成绩，比起贺诚在领导卫生工作时期是有了根本的变化，这是客观上不应抹煞的好的一面；但是，在另一方面，由于卫生部领导上存在着主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，以及左右摇摆、拖拉作风的影响，致使中医工作还未能取得应有的成绩，甚至发生了不少的缺点和错误。
    西医学习中医工作需要考虑到两种学术体系的特点，才能顺利推行
    西医学习中医是继承发扬祖国医学遗产一个关键性的问题，卫生部在开展西医学习中医工作时，我认为没有很好考虑到中、西医学是两种不同学术体系的特点，开展得有点过快，人数过多。就我了解的情况，二年脱产学习班收效最好，容易贯彻系统学习，全面掌握，整理提高的方针。不少二年脱产学习的西医经过系统学习并且和临床实际结合以后，不但消除了对中医的错误认识，反而对祖国医学发生浓厚的情感，认为中医的理论是有许多朴素的辩证唯物主义的道理，它的治疗规律或法则是有科学的道理的，只是缺乏现代科学的阐释，而这正是西医学习中医以后应当担负的光荣任务。因此，我认为西医学习中医的工作，应当将领导的重心放到二年脱产学习班上，在现有的基础上不断地加以提高和改进。如果说二年脱产学习班是成功的，那么在职学习班就不能不是失败的了。对于不同情况不同对象企图用同一内容和方式，达到同一的目的和要求，这种脱离实际的主观主义的作法，就不能不将工作导致失败。学习任何一种学术都是有连续性的，特别是学习中医，如像在职学习班一日曝之、十日寒之，又不能和临床实习相结合，就很难谈上学习的效果了。学习中医是必须紧密地结合临床实际的，因为中医的理论只有通过临床实践才能体会到其中的奥妙和它指导实践的重要作用，否则光啃书本是啃不出名堂的。余云岫不就是啃了许多中医书籍没有结合临床来深刻体会和深入钻研，结果不是把中医否定了，认为中医不科学吗？在职学习班失败的原因是很多的，我认为最主要的原因是在于这一种学习方式和方法本身上有错误，既不能学好条文，又不能学会治病，三年时间拖的又长，应该当机立断，彻底转变，根据自愿原则和实际情况，迅速改变成多种多样的形式，不要再继续被动下去了。
    四所中医学院既经开办，即应加强领导
    很显然，在缺乏充分准备的情况下同时开办四所中医学院也是有点急躁，既然已经开办了就应当下决心，拿大力，把现有四所中医学院办好。我认为当前最中心的问题是在于充实领导、充实师资和充实设备，加强教学领导，提高教学质量和效果，使学生确实能学好。但是，我不同意那种认为中医学院是办错了的谬论，他们骨子里仍是否定祖国医学遗产，这是民族虚无主义思想的表现。
    中医研究院已成立快二年了，现有六百多名干部，其中西医约一百七十名，中医约六十名，其余为一般干部。从短短的二年时间上看，对中医研究院的工作成绩是不应作过高的要求，但中医研究院的工作成绩确实是不能令人满意的。我认为中医研究院问题的症结是在于对党的中医政策阳奉阴违，没有贯彻，因而长期地不能根据党的方针政策的精神，将中医研究院的方针任务、研究步骤和工作方案正确地制定下来，甚至某些反中医的言论曾在中医研究院公开横行过，打击中医的事实也在附属医院出现过。因此，中医研究院必须进行整顿，不但在组织机构和人员编制应当加以调整和精简，更主要的还是应当在党的政策方针上求得思想认识的一致，从思想上加以整顿，才能为今后开展工作打下正确的基础。
    此外，如中医带徒弟，中医参加医院工作等等，我认为都是有成绩的，但也有毛病。总起来看，卫生部在贯彻执行中医政策上的主要缺点和错误，我认为是有急躁情绪，粗枝大叶，调查研究不够，深入检查差，尤其是及时解决问题更差，致使中医工作遭受到不应有的损失，这正是由于领导上官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义所造成的。但我们绝不允许由于中医工作上存在着缺点和错误，就把中医工作的成绩也抹煞了。我认为中医工作的成绩是基本的，缺点和错误是次要的，这不是教条。因为中医工作中的缺点和错误是发展前进中所产生的，和贺诚领导卫生工作时的错误是有本质的区别的，因而卫生部领导上克服了三个主义之后，这些缺点和错误是能够纠正和改进的。
    最后，我要提醒大家警惕，在卫生队伍里是暗藏着有野心分子，他们企图夺取党对卫生工作的领导，他们已经散布了许多恶毒的言论，有人说共产党不懂科学技术，外行不能领导内行；又有人说凡是党委或党组抓得紧的防治单位科学技术特别落后；又有人说卫生部许多部长没有一个西医专家，所以卫生工作一团糟；甚至有人主张医护联盟对干部进行考试，学术不及格就要下台；又有人说苏联医学没有一样是先进，例如保护医疗制无痛分娩法我们说很好，然而也在他们否定之列。这些恶毒言论不胜枚举。我们应该注意，发表这些恶毒言论的，正是那些自封为大知识分子大科学家的人们，与章罗联盟有密切的联系，希望全体卫生工作者要和这些有野心的右派分子，从思想上、政治上划清界限，坚决地向他们回击。
