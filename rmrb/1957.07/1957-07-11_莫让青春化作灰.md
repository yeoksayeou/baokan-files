Don't Let Youth Turn to Ashes

The following poem, originally published on a wall poster at a certain university in Beijing, is intended to persuade a rightist who is still wavering and has not yet decided to change his ways. It is reprinted here, with the real name omitted.

    I am delighted to hear that Mr. × has raised the banner of righteousness,
    A prodigal son returning is worth more than gold;
    With food and drink prepared, we wait by the roadside,
    We only hear the thunder, but see no rain.
    Dodging and hiding, secretly drawing the bow,
    Hiding and dodging, hypocritically acting,
    Crying and weeping, lamenting sadly,
    Weeping and crying, fearing medicine.
    ×××, ×××,
    A good doctor does not pity the tears of the patient;
    Rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff and turn back quickly,
    Don't let your youth turn to ashes.

    莫让青春化作灰
    下面这首诗，原载北京某大学的墙报，是劝一位在彷徨中尚未决心转变的右派分子的。现转载于此，并隐去真实姓名。
    欣闻×君举义旗，
    败子回头胜金玉，
    簟食壶浆待路旁，
    只听雷声不见雨。
    躲躲闪闪暗张弦，
    闪闪躲躲伪造作，
    哭哭啼啼放悲声，
    啼啼哭哭畏汤药。
    ×××，×××，
    好医不怜病人泪；
    悬崖勒马速回头，
    莫让青春化作灰。
