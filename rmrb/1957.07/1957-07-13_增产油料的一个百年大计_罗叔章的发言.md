I fully endorse the six reports presented by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu. These reports demonstrate the glorious achievements of the nation under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with 600 million people wholeheartedly dedicating their efforts to complete or overfulfill unprecedented socialist construction over the past year. This provides a stern rebuttal to the small handful of right-wing elements who, under the guise of the Party's rectification movement over the past three months, have been opposing the Party, the socialist system, and the people's democratic dictatorship. The representatives at the conference speeches and group discussions launched head-on blows and persistent struggles against the right-wing elements Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, and others. The right-wing elements have become turtles in a jar today, and the people have laid a dragnet. They will be crushed if they don't surrender. Right-wing elements! Quickly rein in your horses at the edge of the precipice, and don't cut yourselves off from the people. The people are magnanimous.

I am a worker in the Ministry of Food Industry. Please allow me to talk about the reclamation and development of woody oil tea forests and how to rationally utilize new oil sources. In the winter of 1956 and May of this year, I inspected the issue of oil raw materials in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hunan and deeply felt the importance of this issue.

As the saying goes, "The seven necessities to begin a day are fuel, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." Oil is not only a necessity in people's daily lives, but also a very important raw material in modern industrial production, such as manufacturing soap, glycerin, paint, hardened oil, stearic acid, ore dressing agents, lubricating oil, etc. Its position in the national economy and the people's livelihood cannot be ignored.

After the national liberation, due to vigorous promotion of various advanced oil extraction experiences, the oil extraction rate was increased. A total of more than 210,000 tons of oil were produced and saved in 1955 and 1956. However, the production and sales of oil have been very tight in recent years. Especially this year, because farmers in oil-producing areas retained more oil for themselves, the state's purchase volume decreased by more than 200,000 tons compared with last year. Although industrial oil consumption was compressed and oil exports were reduced by 120,000 tons, domestic sales of oil still decreased by more than 100,000 tons compared with last year. Therefore, some places have compressed supply quotas, which the people have opinions about. Judging from all aspects of the situation, the shortage of oil supply has a great impact on people's lives and industrial production.

The Fundamental Reason for the Tight Oil Supply

In order to alleviate the tight oil supply situation, the Ministry of Food Industry, together with the Ministry of Grain and the Food Industry Trade Union, convened a national oil production increase conference this year and discussed several measures to increase oil production by another 80,000 tons. However, this still cannot fundamentally solve the serious problem of tight oil supply. After investigating all aspects, I believe that the fundamental reason for the oil shortage in our country lies in:

The oil production cannot keep up with the people's demand for oil (including industrial oil). By 1956, the total output of major oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts had increased by more than double compared with 1949. However, except for peanuts and cottonseed, the annual output of soybeans, sesame, and rapeseed has not reached the highest level before liberation. Among them, the annual output of sesame and rapeseed is about half less than before liberation. In terms of the unit area yield of oil crops, major oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and rapeseed have not reached the highest level before liberation. In particular, the more than 20 million mu of oil tea forests distributed in the southern provinces of our country are still largely barren. For example, Hunan Province originally had 7 million mu of oil tea forests, and 40% is still barren. Jiangxi Province originally had 6 million mu of oil tea forests, and 50% to 60% are still barren. Zhejiang Province originally had 1.2 million mu of oil tea forests, and 25% is barren. Even felling is very serious in some places.

In 1957, the national oil crop output was 17.24 million tons, but only 7.56 million tons were supplied for oil extraction, which could produce 1.667 million tons of oil. If the oil production reaches 3.1 to 3.2 million tons by 1962 according to the eight major suggestions, there should be 16.22 million tons of oil crops for oil extraction. We are very concerned about whether this number can be reached, because the main key to the failure to complete the oil plan over the years is the lack of raw materials. On the other hand, there is also irrational utilization of oil crops that can be used for oil extraction. For example, farmers in some areas directly use oil crops as feed or fertilizer in the ground (only in Changwei Prefecture, Shandong, 5.65 million catties of soybeans were directly used in the ground last year, with a loss of 438,000 catties of oil). In addition, a part of rice bran and soybeans allocated by the state as feed and non-staple food should also be pre-extracted for oil, but most of them were not extracted. Again, the full utilization of advanced mechanical oil extraction equipment is not enough. This year, the amount of oil crops processed by mechanical extraction has been reduced by no less than 1 million tons. According to the calculation of an average of 2 to 3 catties less oil per 100 catties of oil crops, 40 million to 60 million catties of oil will be lost. These are serious wastes.

From the current point of view and from a long-term point of view, to alleviate the tight oil supply situation, it is necessary to solve the problem of increasing oil raw material production. To solve the problem of increasing oil production, in addition to paying attention to and making necessary arrangements for the existing oil crop planting area, and solving the problem of the low purchase price of some oil crops, I would like to provide the following two points:

Restoration and Development of Oil Tea Forests

I. A century-long plan for the planned and step-by-step reclamation and development of woody oil tea forests.

Oil tea is one of the major special woody oil crops in our country, mainly distributed in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Zhejiang provinces. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the area in the country was about 20 million mu, producing 150,000 tons of oil. In addition to supplying local consumption, exports were very popular. Due to the devastation during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, and the failure to pay attention to reclamation after liberation, there are still 7 million mu of old barren forests among the current 20 million mu, accounting for about 40%. The reclaimed area has not yet reached the pre-war output. For example, the average oil yield per mu before the war was about 15 catties (according to the statistics of four agricultural cooperatives in Xintian Township, Dongmen District, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, the average yield per mu before the war was 16.8 catties). At present, the average yield is only 6 to 7 catties. However, individual tea farmers in individual areas have made great efforts in reclamation and have achieved high yields through proper management. For example, the oil tea forest of Yuan Laoqi in Huangpo Township, Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, can produce 120 catties of oil per mu, and the oil tea forest of Xin Guangming, a member of the Qiguo No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, can produce 215 catties of oil per mu. It can be seen that as long as the reclamation work is done well, it is possible to produce an average of 25 to 40 catties of oil per mu. If all the more than 20 million mu of oil tea forests in the country can be fully reclaimed, calculating at an average oil yield of 25 catties per mu, 250,000 tons of oil can be produced; if each mu can produce 40 catties, 400,000 tons of oil can be produced. This potential is very great. Moreover, there are many barren mountains in the southern provinces. If they can be further cultivated and developed, the oil production will be even greater. Oil tea is a mountain crop with many characteristics, such as: it does not compete with grain and cotton for land; the cultivation technology is easy, and the labor for operation and management is small (oil tea requires three labor days per mu per year, while rice requires fifteen labor days per mu per year); the growth age after planting can reach more than 100 years; the oil extraction rate is high. There is a kind of red oil tea in Guangdong and Zhejiang, with an oil content of 70% (this variety should be vigorously promoted in the future); the quality of oil tea is excellent, and it is a non-drying oil, which is an edible vegetable oil with high nutritional value. Tea bran can be used as fertilizer and detergent; each ton of tea oil exported can be exchanged for seven tons of chemical fertilizer, which is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of thirty tons of cake fertilizer; the scenery of the oil tea forest area is like an evergreen park; oil tea forests have strong resistance to natural disasters, and have great adaptability to the soil except for alkalinity. In the southern provinces of our country, in addition to Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangxi as key oil tea forest areas, other hilly areas and mountains in Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, Hubei, and Guizhou can also be developed in large quantities. Large-scale development of oil tea forests is not only a favorable way to solve the oil resource problem in the above-mentioned provinces of our country, but also can improve the economic situation of farmers in mountainous areas.
(For example, the average annual income of each person in the Zaozi Cooperative in Yongxing County, Hunan, is 40 yuan just from tea oil revenue. If the unit yield is increased and bee farming is promoted as a sideline, the income can be further increased). According to the above situation, it can be proved that vigorously reclaiming and developing woody oil crops—oil tea forests—is very important, both from the perspective of increasing oil production and its own economic value.

Since it takes six to seven years for newly planted oil tea forests to bear fruit, and reclamation only takes two to three years to obtain a bumper harvest, the labor and financial resources consumed by new planting and reclamation are different. Therefore, areas with many barren forests should first start with reclaiming existing barren forests and focus on increasing the yield per unit area; areas with conditions for development should develop new planting forests as much as possible. Regardless of reclamation or new planting, the following issues must be resolved.

(1) Require the government to strengthen leadership and planning. Governments at all levels should plan to develop oil tea forests in areas suitable for oil tea growth based on the soil, climate, and other conditions in the region. Under the principle of adapting to local conditions, in areas where oil tea production is the main focus, oil tea production should be given priority, and reclamation labor should be properly arranged (mountain areas lacking labor should be supported, such as the practice in Jiangxi, which is very good). Establish a protection management system, and it is recommended that the forestry department establish a special management agency and scientific research agency for economic forests to strengthen management and technical guidance.

(2) Properly handle the issue of oil tea forests joining the cooperative. If tea forests do not join the cooperative, they cannot be included in the agricultural cooperative's production plan, and the forest owners will not be confident and will not actively manage them. Some of those who have already joined the cooperative have been priced too low, affecting the production enthusiasm of the members. Therefore, it is necessary to make a reasonable assessment of production and give the forest owners the compensation they deserve. The work points for reclaiming tea mountains should also be slightly higher than agricultural work points, and should be calculated and distributed uniformly with agricultural, forestry, and sideline occupations in the same year to improve farmers' enthusiasm for reclaiming tea mountains.

(3) Issue loans and subsidize rations. Reclamation of tea mountains requires three years to generate income. The government should consider issuing a portion of interest-free loans to show encouragement. If calculated based on 7 million mu of barren forests, each mu needs a loan of 5 yuan (3 to 5 workers per mu), requiring more than 35 million yuan, which can be recovered in batches starting from the third year. Since digging mountains and splitting mountains is heavy physical labor, according to farmers' reflections, each person needs to eat at least three catties of rice per day, which requires subsidizing more than 16 million catties of rations (approximately 2.5 catties of rice per person per day). It is hoped that this can be reimbursed within the quota of grain unified sales.

(4) Give as much consideration as possible in taxation issues. All new planting forests and reclaimed forests should be exempt from agricultural tax before they generate income. Before the income reaches the normal output of the same land, agricultural tax may be exempted or reduced at the discretion of the situation. Goods tax should be exempted on self-retained oil.

I believe that reclaiming and developing oil tea forests is a century-long plan to solve the problem of increasing oil production, and under the existing 20 million mu base, the conditions in all aspects are relatively good. As long as the government decides on the policy of reclaiming and developing oil tea, and leaders at all levels attach importance to it, it can be guaranteed that oil production can be increased around the second five-year plan, or at least reduce some of the oil shortage situation.

Rational Use of New Oil Sources

II. How to utilize new oil sources.

In order to alleviate some of the current oil shortage situation, I suggest:

(1) Use rice bran to extract oil:

Our country produces about 5 million tons of rice bran annually, of which 1.247 million tons are controlled and concentrated in cities by the state. As long as this part is used to extract oil, 124,000 tons of oil can be produced. Moreover, the rice bran after oil extraction is easy to store and transport, and has no adverse effects on pig feeding. Rice bran contains lipolytic enzymes, and if the oil is not extracted in time, it is easy to deteriorate and produce rancid moldy odors, which pigs do not like to eat. Because oil extraction reduces about 140,000 tons of rice bran, the Ministry of Grain plans to use a certain amount of miscellaneous grains to compensate, so there is no need to worry about the reduction of feed (for example, allocating 140,000 tons of sorghum is equal to the output of 1.65 million mu of land, but increasing the production of 120,000 tons of oil is equivalent to planting 18 million mu of soybeans and 11 million mu of rapeseed, which is very cost-effective). Using oil-extracted bran cake as pig feed has long been widely practiced in Democratic Germany and capitalist countries. In many years of pig feeding experiments in various parts of our country, the effect has also been proven to be very good. Therefore, the use of rice bran for oil extraction should be vigorously promoted.

(2) Use feed soybeans to extract oil:

The Ministry of Grain estimates that the amount of soybeans left in rural areas for feed use each year is about 1 million tons. If it can be used to extract oil, 120,000 tons of oil can be produced. It is a pity that these soybeans are directly used to feed livestock without extracting oil. After soybeans are extracted for oil, the protein is denatured and easily absorbed by livestock. The rural areas of Northeast China have always been accustomed to using cake to feed livestock. According to experiments in some areas of Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, the livestock are fed very well, and the farmers support this practice. For the reduction in feed quantity due to oil extraction, about 120,000 tons, it is hoped that the Ministry of Grain will adopt a method of increasing allocations to make up for the farmers. Increasing the allocation of 120,000 tons of soybeans is equal to the output of 2 million mu of land. Increasing the production of 120,000 tons of oil is equal to expanding the soybean planting area by 18 million mu. Relevant departments must not fail to calculate this account. However, the processing policies and methods must be convenient and beneficial to farmers (methods such as exchanging cake and oil for materials, processing on behalf of farmers, or purchasing oil products and supplementing equivalent feed can be adopted). Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan and Taixing County in Jiangsu have achieved good experience in this regard, and the majority of farmers are very welcome.

(3) Under the premise of ensuring the quality of tofu, use cold-pressed soybean slices to make tofu:

The main component of tofu is protein. When using soybeans to make tofu, part of the oil is also lost in the water and residue, which is an invisible waste. However, if soybeans are cold-pressed to reduce a portion of the oil before making tofu, it will not affect the quality and quantity of the tofu. According to the analysis of the Central Institute of Hygiene, cold-pressed soybean tofu has increased other nutrients in addition to a slight reduction in fat. The central issue is that the technology of making tofu must be mastered. Judging from the situation in Shanghai, Wuhan, Changsha and other places, the tofu made with cold-pressed bean slices in these places is even more delicious than the tofu made with soybeans in Beijing; we have personally eaten and compared them. It is hoped that relevant departments will vigorously organize technical exchanges for making tofu and improve the quality of tofu. As long as it is guaranteed that cold-pressed soybean slice tofu is not inferior to local soybean tofu, it can be gradually promoted. In 1956, about 300,000 tons of soybeans were used for tofu in various cities in our country. If a portion of oil is cold-pressed out, 60 million catties of oil can also be produced.

(4) Develop wild plant oil crops:

Wild oil crops in our country are found everywhere, and the quantity is considerable. More than 200 species have been discovered so far, and more than 70 species can be used for oil extraction, including more than 20 species for edible use and more than 40 species for industrial use. However, wild oil crops are scattered, difficult to collect, and some oil crops have low oil extraction rates and high costs. There should be measures to encourage farmers to actively collect in terms of prices and taxes, and industrial departments should strengthen chemical analysis, research oil extraction technology, and introduce uses. Supply and marketing cooperatives should vigorously strengthen purchasing work. If the relevant industrial departments and cooperatives can attach importance to and lead this work, and give some support to agricultural cooperatives, it can be developed, and the oil produced can at least solve a part of the oil for lighting or watering vehicles in rural areas.

(5) Coastal fishing areas should pay attention to the production of fish oil and porpoise oil, which are good raw materials for making hardened oil. According to fishermen in Zhoushan, they were unwilling to produce in the past because they were afraid that there would be no sales. Now the industrial department has successfully tested that all the products can be purchased. This can not only replace a part of edible oil, but also increase the income of fishermen. It is hoped that the aquatic product department can mobilize fishermen to produce in large quantities.

If the above problems are solved, the oil shortage situation can be greatly improved. I would like to ask the representatives for instructions on whether the above opinions are appropriate.

    增产油料的一个百年大计
    罗叔章的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、张鼎丞检察长和最高人民法院董必武院长等的六个报告。从这些报告中显示了国家一年来在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，发挥了六亿人民全心全意献出自己的力量，完成或超额完成了史无前例的社会主义建设的光辉成就。从而给了最近三月以来借着党的整风运动进行反党反社会主义制度反人民民主专政的一小撮右派分子严正的驳斥，代表们在大会发言和小组讨论上都给右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、龙云、黄绍竑、谭惕吾等以迎头痛击和不懈的斗争，右派分子在今天已成了瓮中之鳖，人民已设下了天罗地网，不投降就粉碎，右派分子们！赶快勒马悬崖，不要自绝于人民吧，人民是会宽宏大量的。
    我是食品工业部的工作者，请允许我谈谈关于垦复和发展木本油料油茶林和如何合理利用新油源。一九五六年冬季和今年五月我曾经到山东、江苏和湖南视察了油脂原料问题，深切感到这个问题的重要性。
    俗话说：“开门七件事，柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶。”油不但是人民日常生活所必需，在现代工业生产中也是一项十分重要的原材料，如制造肥皂、甘油、油漆、硬化油、硬脂酸、选矿剂、润滑油等等，在国计民生中的地位是不可忽视的。
    全国解放后，由于大力推广各种榨油先进经验，提高了出油率，一九五五、五六两年曾共增产节约油脂二十一万余吨，但是几年来油脂产销情况还是很紧张的，尤其今年因为产油区农民自留油增多了，致使国家收购量比去年减少二十多万吨，虽然压缩了工业用油并减少出口油十二万吨，内销油仍较去年减少十万多吨，因而有些地方压缩了供应定量，人民对此是有意见的。从各方面情况看来，油脂供应的紧张对人民生活和工业生产影响是很大的。
    油脂供应紧张的根本原因
    为了缓和油脂供应的紧张情况，今年食品工业部协同粮食部和食品工会召开了全国的油脂增产会议，讨论了若干措施，拟再增产油脂八万吨，但是这仍不能从根本上解决油脂供应紧张的严重问题。从各方面考察，我认为我国油脂紧张的根本原因在于：
    油料产量赶不上人民对油脂的需要量（包括工业用油料）。到一九五六年为止，大豆、花生等主要油料作物的总产量比一九四九年约增长一倍多，但除花生、棉子外，大豆、芝麻、菜子的年产量还没有达到解放前的最高水平，其中芝麻、菜子的年产量比解放前约减少一半以上，在油料单位面积产量方面，大豆、花生、芝麻、菜子等主要油料也没有达到解放前的最高水平。尤其是分布在我国南方各省的二千多万亩油茶林仍然大部荒芜着，如湖南省原有油茶林七百万亩，还荒芜百分之四十，江西省原有油茶林六百万亩，还荒芜百分之五十至六十。浙江省原有油茶林一百二十万亩也有百分之二十五的荒芜林。甚至有些地方砍伐现象也很严重。
    一九五七年全国油料产量一千七百二十四万吨，供给榨油的仅七百五十六万吨，可出油一百六十六万七千吨，如果到一九六二年按八大建议数字产油三百一十至三百二十万吨，应有供榨油料一千六百二十二万吨，这个数字能否到达，我们十分关心，因为历年油脂不能完成计划，主要关键是原料不足。另一方面，对可以用作榨油的油料，也存在着利用不合理的情况，如某些地区农民将油料直接作为饲料或下地作肥料（只山东昌潍专区去年直接下地的大豆即有五百六十五万斤，损失油四十三万八千斤），还有国家拨作饲料和副食品的一部分米糠和大豆应该预榨一部分油也多未榨取。再次是充分利用先进机榨设备不够，今年机榨减少加工油料不下一百万吨，按平均一百斤油料少出二至三斤油计算，就损失油四千至六千万斤，这些都是严重的浪费。
    从当前看，从长远看，缓和油脂供应的紧张情况，就必须解决油脂原料的增产问题。要解决油料增产，除对现有的油料播种面积加以注意和作必要的安排，并解决某些油料收购价偏低情况外，特提供以下两点意见：
      恢复和发展油茶林
    一、百年大计有计划有步骤的垦复与发展木本油料油茶林。
    油茶是我国大宗的特产木本油料之一，主要分布在湖南、江西、广西、浙江四省，面积在抗战前全国约有二千多万亩，产油十五万吨，除供当地食用外，出口很受欢迎。由于抗日战争及解放战争期间遭受摧残和解放以后没有注意垦复，所以目前在二千多万亩中仍有七百万亩老荒林，约占百分之四十。已垦复的也还没有达到战前产量。如战前平均每亩产油量十五斤左右（据湖南省浏阳县东门区新田乡四个农业社统计，战前每亩平均产十六点八斤），目前一般只能平均产油六至七斤，但个别地区少数茶农因垦复下力，经营得法，产量颇高。如湖南省桃源县黄婆乡袁老七的油茶林，每亩能产油一百二十斤，浙江省青田县棋国第一农业社社员辛光明的油茶林每亩能产油二百一十五斤，可见只要作好垦复工作，平均每亩产油二十五至四十斤是可能的。全国二千多万亩油茶林如能全部垦复，按每亩平均产油二十五斤计，即可产油二十五万吨；如每亩能产四十斤，则可产油四十万吨，这个潜力是很大的。而且南方各省荒山很多，如能进一步培植发展，产油量将更大。油茶是山地作物，它的特点很多，如：不与粮棉争地；栽培技术容易，经营管理用工少（油茶每亩每年花三个劳动日，种水稻每亩每年花十五个劳动日）；种植以后生长年龄达百年以上；出油率高，广东、浙江地区有一种红花油茶，含油率达百分之七十（这种品种将来应大力推广）；油茶品质优良，属不干性油，为营养价值较高的食用植物油，茶枯既可作肥料，又可作洗涤剂；茶油出口每吨可换回七吨化肥，七吨化肥相当于三十吨饼肥的肥效；油茶林区的风景好像四季常青的大公园；油茶林对自然灾害抵抗较强，对土壤除忌碱性外，适应性较大，在我国南方各省，除湖南、江西、浙江、广西为重点油茶林区外，其他如四川、广东、云南、福建、湖北、贵州等省的丘陵地带与山地，均可大量发展。大量发展油茶林不仅是解决我国上述各省油料资源的有利途径，同时还可改善山区农民的经济面貌
  （如湖南永兴县枣子社只是茶油收入平均每人每年即有四十元，如提高单位产量，再加提倡养蜂副业，收入还可增加）。根据上述情况，就可以证明，大力垦复与发展木本油料——油茶林，不论从增产油料和它本身的经济价值来讲，都是非常重要的。
      由于新造油茶林须要六年到七年才能收果，垦复只要两年到三年就可得到丰收，所以新植与垦复所耗用的劳力与财力是不同的。因此荒芜林多的地区，应首先从垦复现有荒林着手，并着重提高单位面积产量；有条件发展的地区，应尽可能的发展新植林。不论垦复、新造林，必须解决如下几个问题。
    （1）要求政府加强领导与规划。各级政府应根据本地区土壤、气候等条件，凡适宜油茶生长的地区，均应规划发展油茶林，并在因地制宜的原则下，在油茶生产为主的地区，要把油茶生产放在首要地位，适当安排垦复劳力（劳力缺乏的山区，应设法支援，如江西的作法就很好），建立保护管理制度，建议林业部门建立经济林的专管机构和科学研究机构，以加强管理和技术指导。
    （2）妥善处理油茶林入社问题。茶林不入社，便无法纳入农业社生产计划，林主心里没底经营也不积极。已经入社的也有些作价偏低，影响社员生产情绪，因此必须作到合理评产，给林主以应得报酬，对垦复茶山的工分也应略高于农业工分，并与当年农林副业统一计算分配，以提高农民垦复茶山的积极性。
    （3）发放贷款、补助口粮。垦复茶山须经三年才有收益，政府应考虑发放一部分无息贷款以示鼓励。如按七百万亩荒芜林计算每亩贷款五元（每亩需工三至五个），需要三千五百多万元，可从第三年起分批收回。由于挖山刨山是重体力劳动，据农民反映每人每天至少需食三斤米，这就需要补助口粮一千六百多万斤（每人每天约补助二点五斤米），希望能在粮食统销指标内加以报销。
    （4）在税收问题上尽可能的加以照顾。凡新植林及垦复林在收益前应一律免征农业税，其收益未达到同等土地的常年产量前，可酌情免征或减征农业税，对自留油应免征货物税。
    我认为垦复和发展油茶林是解决增产油料的百年大计，而且是在现有二千多万亩的基础上各方面的条件均比较好的情况下，只要政府决定了垦复和发展油茶的方针政策，各级政府领导重视起来是可以保证在第二个五年计划前后就能增产油料，至少也能减少一些油脂的紧张情况。
    合理利用新油源
    二、如何利用新油源。
    为了缓和一些目前油脂的紧张情况，我建议：
    （1）利用米糠榨油：
    我国年产米糠约五百万吨，其中由国家掌握集中在城市的米糠达一百二十四万七千吨，只要把这一部分利用起来榨油，即可增产油脂十二万四千吨，而且榨油后的米糠易于保管运输，对喂猪没有不良影响。米糠中含有解脂酵素，如不及时榨油极易变质，产生酸败霉味，猪就不喜食。因榨油约减少十四万吨米糠，粮食部准备用一定数量的杂粮弥补，也不必顾虑饲料的减少（如增拨十四万吨高粱等于一百六十五万亩土地产量，但增产十二万吨油脂，则相当于种植大豆一千八百万亩，种植菜子一千一百万亩，这是很合算的）。利用榨过油的糠饼作喂猪饲料，民主德国和资本主义各国早已大量实行。我国各地的多年喂猪试验中，亦证明效果甚好。因此对利用米糠榨油应大力推广。
    （2）利用饲料大豆榨油：
    粮食部估算全国每年留在农村作饲料用的大豆数量约一百万吨，如能用来榨油可出油十二万吨，目前这些大豆不经榨油而直接去喂牲口是很可惜的。大豆经榨油后蛋白质变性易为牲口吸收，我国东北农村向来都是习惯用饼喂牲口，据河南、山东、安徽等省部分地区试验，牲口喂的很好，农民都支持这一做法，对因榨油减少的饲料数量约十二万吨，希望粮食部采取增拨办法补足农民。增拨十二万吨大豆等于二百万亩土地产量，增产十二万吨油，则等于扩大大豆种植面积一千八百万亩。这一笔帐有关部门不可不算。但在加工政策和办法上必须做到对农民方便有利（可采取以饼、油换料，代农民加工或收购油品补给相当饲料等办法），河南新乡专区和江苏太兴县在这方面已取得良好经验，广大农民都很欢迎。
    （3）在保证豆腐质量的条件下，利用冷榨豆片制豆腐：
    豆腐的主要成分是蛋白质，用大豆做豆腐其中油分也是部分损失在水和残渣中，这是人们看不见的一种浪费。而大豆经过冷法压榨，减少一部分油脂后再做豆腐，并不影响豆腐质量和数量，根据中央卫生研究院的分析，冷榨大豆豆腐除脂肪稍为减少外，其他营养物质均有增加，中心问题是必须掌握好作豆腐的技术。从上海、武汉、长沙等地的情况看，这些地方用冷榨豆片制的豆腐比北京用大豆制的豆腐还好吃；这是我们亲自吃过比较过的，希望有关部门大力组织制豆腐的技术交流，提高豆腐质量，只要保证使冷榨豆片豆腐不次于当地的大豆豆腐，就可逐步推广。一九五六年我国各城市用作豆腐的大豆约为三十万吨，如经过冷榨出一部分油，也可增产油脂六千万斤。
    （4）开发野生植物油料：
    我国野生油料遍及各地，数量不少，目前已发现二百多种，可以用来榨油的有七十多种，其中有二十多种可供食用，四十多种可供工业用，但野生油料分散、收集困难，有些油料出油率低，成本高，在价格和税收方面应该有鼓励农民积极收集的措施，工业部门应加强化验分析、研究榨油技术经验介绍用途。供销合作社应大力加强收购工作。这一工作有关工业部门和合作社如能重视、领导起来，给农业社一些支持，是可以发展的，生产出来的油最低限度也可以解决农村中一部分照明或浇车用的油料。
    （5）沿海渔区应注意生产鱼油和海豕油，这是制硬化油的好原料，据舟山渔民反映，过去不愿生产是怕没有销路，现在工业部门已经试验成功产多少均可全部收购，这不但可以代替一部分食用油，也可增加渔民很多收入，希望水产部门能发动渔民大量生产。
    以上问题如获解决，油脂紧张情况，是可以大大的好转的。以上意见是否妥当，提请代表们指教。
