Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 5th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Korean Vice Premier Choi Yong-kun told two reporters from the German Democratic Republic's State Broadcasting Committee on July 4th that the primary task in Korea today is to take effective measures to transform the armistice into a lasting peace. He called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the entire Korean peninsula and the reduction of armed forces in Korea to the minimum level. He said that this would alleviate tensions in Korea and create the possibility for the Korean people themselves to peacefully reunify their homeland on a democratic basis.

Choi Yong-kun pointed out that in order to accomplish the above tasks, it is first necessary to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and to obtain international guarantees for the maintenance of lasting peace. He believes that convening an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries is very necessary.

Choi Yong-kun called on the Korean people to continue their efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea, because the Korean issue is the Korean people's own issue. He said, "We strongly demand the elimination of distrust between North and South Korea, the realization of mutual contact and visits, and the restoration of economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea."

In answering questions raised by the German reporters visiting Korea, Choi Yong-kun once again condemned the US side's unilateral violation of Article 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement by bringing new weapons into South Korea for aggressive purposes, and used concrete examples to illustrate the fact that the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently and strictly abided by the armistice agreement, while the US side has consistently violated it.

    崔庸健要求采取有效措施
    把朝鲜停战转为持久和平
    新华社平壤5日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜内阁副首相崔庸健7月4日对德意志民主共和国国家广播事业委员会的两位记者说，今天在朝鲜的首要任务是采取有效措施把停战转变为持久和平。他要求从全朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，并且把在朝鲜的武装部队减少到最低限度。他说，这样一来，就可以缓和朝鲜的紧张局势和创造出由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上和平统一祖国的可能性。
    崔庸健指出，为了完成上述任务，首先应该防止朝鲜战争的重起，并且要使持久和平的保持获得国际保证。他认为召开由有关国家广泛参加的国际会议是非常必要的。
    崔庸健要求朝鲜人民为朝鲜的和平统一继续努力，因为朝鲜问题是朝鲜人民自己的问题。他说，我们强烈要求消除南北朝鲜之间的不信任，实现互相接触和访问，恢复南北朝鲜之间经济和文化的交流。
    崔庸健在答复访问朝鲜的德国记者所提出的问题的时候，再次谴责了美方片面破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项把新式武器运进南朝鲜的侵略目的，并且用具体事例说明了朝中方面一贯严格遵守停战协定和美方一贯破坏停战协定的事实。
