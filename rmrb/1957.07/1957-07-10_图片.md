Cork is the bark of the cork oak. It is fine, light, soft, and elastic, and has properties such as being non-conductive and non-heat-conducting. It is a necessary material for manufacturing cork, life-saving equipment, and anti-corrosion equipment. The cork produced in Henan Province this year is pure, thick, elastic, and of good quality. Exporting this kind of cork can bring back four tons of steel for every ton.
