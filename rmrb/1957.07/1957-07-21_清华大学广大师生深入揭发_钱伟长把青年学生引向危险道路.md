Tsinghua University Faculty and Students Deeply Expose
Qian Weichang for Leading Young Students Down a Dangerous Road

(Our Newspaper News) Tsinghua University continued to hold a meeting on the 20th to criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of rightist Qian Weichang. In addition to the faculty and students of Tsinghua University, teachers and researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University also attended the meeting.

At the meeting, many professors and students made powerful exposures and criticisms of Qian Weichang's reactionary activities from different perspectives. Huang Dun, Hu Haichang, and Ye Kaiyuan, who were once Qian Weichang's favorite students and assistants, exposed Qian Weichang's boasting about himself among young people, deceiving young people into believing in him, and leading young people down a dangerous road. Some teachers and students focused on exposing the mask of "omnipotent scientist" and "good teacher and helpful friend of young people" that Qian Weichang had long worn. Some teachers focused on exposing the fact that Qian Weichang wanted to take the bourgeois road in science and opposed the socialist road. Many teachers exposed Qian Weichang's anti-Soviet remarks.

Qian Weichang made another self-criticism at the meeting, but it was still not profound and was criticized by everyone.

Wearing a Progressive Cloak to Deceive Young People

Hu Haichang, associate researcher at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a preliminary criticism of some issues regarding how Qian Weichang guided young people in scientific research. He said, how much guidance did Qian Weichang actually give to young people in scientific research? It seems that there was very little profound guidance. He often answered students' questions without careful consideration, and often did not carefully read articles submitted for his review and guidance. Once, he sent an article with errors to the Acta Physica Sinica for publication, but afterwards did not ask the original author to correct it.

Since Qian Weichang did not guide his students attentively, he did not hesitate to lower standards to cater to some people who were eager for quick success. He guided some people to do easy small topics, without requiring them to improve continuously. In fact, some topics were just exercises and did not count as real research.

Qian Weichang said in front of some people that he opposed students being submissive and having no independent opinions of their own. However, he once told me that his best students were those who were both obedient and had independent working ability, followed by those who had less ability but were obedient, and finally those who were disobedient. Everyone can see how much he emphasized obedience in front of his own students! If anyone really did what he said, that would be a dangerous thing.

Among Qian Weichang's many students, Ye Kaiyuan seemed to be the most obedient. Qian Weichang regarded Ye Kaiyuan as his favorite student and promoted him, but in our opinion, Ye Kaiyuan's shortcomings outweighed his advantages. As far as I know, Ye Kaiyuan has made many errors, both large and small, in the process of writing papers or books. The reason why Qian Weichang appreciated Ye Kaiyuan was nothing more than his obedience.

Qian Weichang's so-called enthusiastic guidance of young people in scientific research was not aimed at cultivating more scientific cadres for the people in order to develop the socialist scientific cause, but at cultivating his own private power through guiding scientific research work.

For personal purposes, Qian Weichang did not hesitate to adopt various shameful methods. Since the list of winners of the science prize was announced, many young comrades have wanted to know what kind of person Hu Haichang is. Qian Weichang seized this opportunity, gave an incorrect introduction of me, incited young people's individual fame and fortune thoughts, and opposed the party's ideological education. I can't help but feel indignant about this! He attributed my scientific achievements mainly to his guidance, which caused some people to be uneasy with the work assigned by the organization and wholeheartedly yearn to rely on famous teachers. Qian Weichang emphasized that one can disobey assignments and can not care about politics, as long as one can rely on a famous teacher, one will have fame and fortune. His approach was nothing more than to lure young people away from the leadership of the Party, away from socialism, and onto a dangerous road.

Wanting to be the Emperor of the Scientific Community, Full of Merchant Habits in Academics, Causing a Negative Impact on Young Students

Huang Dun, a lecturer at Peking University, said that Qian Weichang not only wanted to be the president of Tsinghua University, he even wanted to be the emperor of the scientific community.

Qian Weichang is a recognized mechanic, and he uses elasticity as his capital, but he brags and boasts when writing books. He once told students that the sources of other people's results must be indicated, but he himself does not do so. In academics, he is also full of merchant habits, and his methods are consistent.

Ye Kaiyuan of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said: Qian Weichang is my teacher, and I was once confused by the training goals he talked about, the combination of science and engineering schools, and other propositions. I want to draw a clear line with him politically.

Promoting Bourgeois Individualism Among Young People, Causing Young People to Develop a Serious Tendency to Detach from Reality

Yu Xinrong, a graduating student from the Power Department, said: Qian Weichang has long appeared as an "omnipotent scientist" and a "good teacher and helpful friend" to young people. But in fact, he promoted the capitalist direction to us. He described the path of young people marching towards science as the Hu Haichang path. He described obeying the needs of the motherland as a restriction and constraint on young people, and as the resurrection of feudal ideas. He said that young people have no future, and only party members have a future, which is essentially promoting bourgeois individualism. His ideas have had a great impact on graduating students. Some students demanded excessive living conditions and emphasized taking care of themselves when they were assigned work, hoping to stay in big cities, which supported bourgeois individualist ideas.

Under the influence of Qian Weichang, many people think that "all other occupations are inferior, only science is noble." Some people studied automobiles for five years, but when they graduated, they asked to go to the Institute of Mechanics, unwilling to do practical work, thinking that practical work was trivial, mediocre, and difficult to improve. Just imagine, if the young people who are cultivated are unwilling to go to the front line to do practical work, who will guide production? How can we build socialism?

Promoting the View that Scientists are Above Class and Above Politics

Wang Xuecheng, a student in the mechanics class, said that in order to take the capitalist education route, Qian Weichang opposed the establishment of collective teaching and research groups. Later, he suddenly agreed, but he wanted to be the director of the teaching and research group. He advocated having a teaching plan, but he did not have a teaching syllabus. For example, applied mathematics was originally planned to be taught in three semesters, four hours per week, but after the first semester, half of the original plan was left behind.

Qian Weichang also had a saying, which is "genius education." When students reflected that the coursework was heavy, he said that the students' level was poor, and it didn't matter if one-half to one-third were dropped in an exam. What does this have in common with the socialist planned training of talents?

Under the influence of Qian Weichang's thinking, some students only focus on their profession and do not care about politics. They even do not want to participate in the "May Day" and "National Day" parades. "They really don't care about the affairs of the world and only read mechanics books." How incompatible is this with the country's required training goals!

Qian Weichang also promoted the view that scientists are above class and above politics.

Negating the Socialist Education Line, Sowing Discord Between the Party and Scientists

Professor Wu Zhonghua said: Qian Weichang negated the socialist education line and the teaching and research group organization in the advanced education system. In terms of scientific research, he wanted to pull us onto the capitalist road. Their so-called protection of scientists is actually slandering the Party and sowing discord between the Party and scientists. Everyone knows that the Party cherishes scientists very much. In fact, the vast majority of scientists have ample time to engage in scientific research work. Qian Weichang and others suggested that old scientists over the age of sixty should not hold administrative positions, which is also a very bad means. Their intention is to let our beloved Vice President Liu Xianzhu, Vice President Wu Youxun, and other old scientists step down so that they can replace them. On the issue of equipment, they said that the equipment in universities and colleges is simple and crude, which is also a complete lie. On the issue of cultivating new forces, they suggested that scientists have the right to choose training objects, which is another attempt to seize graduate students as their own.

Professor Li Jixiang said: Qian Weichang said that he is an old Tsinghua man, and has always dared to speak and act. In recent years, the feeling of being the master of the house has become increasingly thin. The reason is that the Party's line is blocking him. Qian Weichang holds more than 20 positions, which he could not have dreamed of in the old Tsinghua. But he did not do these jobs well. He vainly tried to be the president of Tsinghua and further seize the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education. Qian Weichang said "the department secretary is dictatorial", but I have also been a department director and worked with secretaries, but I don't have this feeling. The school leaders have always been concerned about the old professors.

Playing a Two-Faced Trick, Neither Respecting Old Teachers Nor Respecting Young Teachers

Professor Wang Zunming said that Qian Weichang has launched as many as eight attacks on socialism in higher education. One of them was before the reorganization of departments and faculties under the leadership of the Ministry of Education. Qian Weichang used the backward mood of a few professors to instigate a fake reorganization of departments and faculties at Tsinghua, arrogantly wanting to establish a large Tsinghua "independent kingdom" with ten schools and thirty-two departments. Qian Weichang claimed that this would be able to resist the state's reorganization of departments and faculties. He told the old professors that his reorganization plan had been approved by the Ministry of Education. He told the Ministry of Education that his reorganization plan was the common opinion of the professors. Fortunately, the trick was exposed and his arrogant plan was not realized.

This spring, the Ministry of Higher Education discussed the teaching plan, and Qian Weichang took the lead in attacking the socialist line of teaching reform.

In science, Qian Weichang pretended to understand some scientific issues, pretending to be an expert. For example, he talked about using cement to make machine tools and using the tide of the Qiantang River estuary to generate electricity. There are many such jokes. Last year, the national concentrated effort to carry out the twelve-year scientific plan was a solemn task. In this solemn task, he also adopted plagiarism and deception, a two-faced trick. Qian Weichang did not understand agricultural machinery, but he insisted on writing a planning draft for agricultural machinery projects. He only wrote about 200 words and could not write any more. Qian Weichang is also an amateur in automation, but he serves as the leader of the automation group. The explanatory note written collectively by others was finally rewritten by Qian Weichang.

Qian Weichang often deceives students and teachers, and sows discord. He wrote in China Youth magazine, "Young people's good friends who have been together since childhood have gradually alienated each other because they are afraid of being checked for engaging in cliques. Proper hobbies and extracurricular activities have been restricted, and everything seems to be worried about. Even eating an ice cream can be considered a waste of life." Isn't this slander? Qian Weichang sows discord among old professors and among scientists. For example, he called Mr. Jin Xiwu "Old Jin" to his face, but maliciously slandered and attacked him behind his back. Qian Weichang also said to Mr. Li Youshan: "There are a group of old guys and a group of little kids in Tsinghua." It is Qian Weichang himself who does not respect old teachers and young teachers.

Negating the Achievements of Learning from the Soviet Union, Scolding Our Country's Scientific Undertakings as a Mess

Lecturer Xing Jiali said that Qian Weichang's view of the Soviet Union is to negate everything, negating teaching, science, and industrial technology.

Qian Weichang shouted empty slogans and was the first to learn from the Soviet Union, but he only knew how to shout slogans. What was he thinking in his heart? In 1953, he said to Li Youshan, I disagree with the views of these young people, but I won't say it now, I'll see later. He had ulterior motives and waited for an opportunity to rise.

Qian Weichang was just using the banner of learning from the Soviet Union, but in his bones he wanted to oppose the Party and take the old capitalist road.

Lu Yingzhong, secretary of the Science Department, said that Qian Weichang participated in the "December 9th" Movement during the democratic revolution, and also participated in the peripheral organization of the Party, the "National Revolutionary Vanguard." But Qian Weichang left his organization during the Anti-Japanese War and stayed in the British concession in Tianjin under Japanese occupation to teach, and then simply left the motherland to study and work in the United States. He completely embarked on the road of bourgeois intellectuals. This is the progressive history that Qian Weichang boasts about!

Regarding economic construction, he also believed that the Party could not lead at all. In the classroom, he also preached the fallacy that old cadres cannot lead industry. He said, "The factory is now in the hands of cadres who do not understand technology and mess around, which is very dangerous and will ruin it. I very much agree that you should study Marxism-Leninism. If you study well, gain the trust of cadres, and become one with them, you should replace them!"

Assistant Teacher Wang Jikang said that in March of this year, Qian Weichang was ordered by Zeng Zhaolun to fly to Taiyuan City, saying that he was going to participate in the founding meeting of the Shanxi Branch of the Science Association. In fact, Qian Weichang's trip to Taiyuan was under the guise of an omnipotent scientist, using the pretext of combining China's specific conditions to oppose dogmatism, and carried out a rampant anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda campaign.

In Shanxi, Qian Weichang scolded China's scientific work thoroughly. Then, under the banner of combining with China's actual situation, he wantonly slandered the Soviet Union and praised the United States. Qian Weichang, posing as an "omnipotent scientist", pretended to understand what he did not understand, and cursed scientists in various fields, slandering that the scientific work under the leadership of the Party today is in a very bad state. He vainly tried to negate the socialist road altogether and take the capitalist road.

Professor Zhang Guangdou said that Qian Weichang's report at the founding meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Branch of the Science Association really made him look like he knew everything. I know very little, only about water conservancy. In this regard, almost none of the high opinions raised by Qian Weichang were correct, which is enough to prove his ignorance in this area. This makes me suspect that his opinions in other areas are also very wrong. More seriously, this report is full of anti-communist and anti-Soviet remarks. On the topic of water energy resources, Qian Weichang said that our water resources are insufficient, which is also wrong. Our water resources are very rich. In the second five-year plan, the proportion of hydropower stations will increase to about 40%. Qian Weichang, as a people's representative, should know this, but he arbitrarily distorted it and attacked the Party. On the issue of the height of dams, he also sowed discord that we cannot learn from the Soviet Union.

Finally, He Dongchang said that Qian Weichang claims to be an old Tsinghua man who cares about Tsinghua, but the Tsinghua he wants is to exclude people who resolutely take the socialist road. Qian Weichang has become the leader of the rightists on campus, and all negative factors are mixed with him. Qian Weichang's road is to tamper with the political direction of Tsinghua. If the political direction of Tsinghua changes, then is it still worth considering? Qian Weichang is not caring for Tsinghua, but pushing Tsinghua to destruction and making students take a dark road.

Xie Zupei, Li Ou and others also spoke at the meeting.

    清华大学广大师生深入揭发
    钱伟长把青年学生引向危险道路
    本报讯　清华大学在20日继续举行批判右派分子钱伟长的反共、反社会主义言论和行动的大会。参加大会的除清华大学师生外，还有中国科学院和北京大学的教师和研究人员。
    会上，许多教授和学生从不同的角度对钱伟长的反动活动都作了有力的揭发和批判。曾经是钱伟长的得意门生和助手的黄敦、胡海昌、叶开沅都揭露了钱伟长在青年中吹嘘自己，骗取青年对他的信仰，把青年引向危险的道路；有教师和学生着重揭穿了钱伟长长期以来以“万能科学家”和“青年的良师益友”的面目出现的外衣；有的教师着重揭发了钱伟长在科学上想走资产阶级道路反对社会主义道路的事实；许多教师揭发了钱伟长的反苏言论。
    钱伟长在会上又做了一次检讨，但仍旧不深刻，受到了大家的指责。
    披着进步的外衣，来蒙蔽青年
    科学院力学研究所副研究员胡海昌对钱伟长如何指导青年作科学研究的一些问题先作初步批判。他说，钱伟长在科学研究上究竟给青年多大的指导呢？现在看来深刻的指导很少。他对学生提出的问题常常没有仔细考虑便回答，对于请他审查和指导的文章也常常没有仔细看。有一次他把一篇有错误的文章送到物理学报去发表，而事后又不叫原作者更正。
    钱伟长既不用心指导他的学生，于是便不惜用降低标准的办法来迎合一部分急于求成的人。他指导某些人作一些容易的小题目，而不要求他不断地提高，其实有些题目只算是一个练习，算不得什么真正的研究。
    钱伟长在有些人面前说，他反对学生唯唯诺诺，毫无自己的独立见解。但是，他曾对我说过，他最好的学生是既听话又有独立工作能力的人，其次是能力较差但听话的人，最后是不听话的人。大家看他在自己学生面前多么强调听话啊！如果有谁真正照他的话去做，那真是危险的事情。
    在钱伟长的许多学生中，看来最听话的要算叶开沅了。钱伟长把叶开沅看作是自己的得意门生而加以宣传，其实在我们看来，叶开沅的缺点多于他的优点。据我了解，叶开沅无论在写论文或写书的过程中，曾犯过不少大大小小的错误。钱伟长所以赏识叶开沅，无非是听话这一点。
    钱伟长所谓热心指导青年作科学研究工作，他的目的并不是在于为人民培养出更多的科学干部，以便发展社会主义的科学事业，而是企图通过指导科学研究工作来培植自己的私人势力。
    钱伟长为了个人目的，不惜采用种种可耻的手法，自从科学奖金得奖名单公布后，有很多青年同志很想了解胡海昌究竟是怎样一个人。钱伟长抓住这个机会，把我作了不正确的介绍，去煽动青年的个人名利思想，去反对党的思想教育。这不能不使我感到愤慨！他把我在科学上取得的成绩，主要归功于受到他的指导，因而引起了一部分人不安心组织分配的工作，而一心一意向往投靠名师。钱伟长强调可以不服从分配，可以不关心政治，只要能投靠名师，到时便会有名有利。他的这种做法，无非要引诱青年脱离党的领导，脱离社会主义，走上危险的道路。
    想做科学界的皇帝，在学术上充满了商人习气，使青年学生受到恶劣影响
    北京大学讲师黄敦说，钱伟长并不是光想当个清华大学的校长，他甚至想要做科学界中的皇帝。
    钱伟长是一个公认的力学家，他以弹性力学为他的资本，但他在写书时自吹自擂。他曾对学生说用别人的结果必须指明出处，可是他自己却并不如此。在学术上他也是充满了商人的气息，他的手法是一贯的。
    科学院力学研究所叶开沅说：钱伟长是我的老师，我也曾为他所说的培养目标、理工合校等主张迷惑过。我要和他在政治上划清界限。
    在青年中宣扬资产阶级个人主义，使青年产生了严重的脱离实际的倾向
    动力系应届毕业生俞欣荣说：钱伟长长期以来是以“万能科学家”和青年的“良师益友”的面目出现的。但他实际上向我们宣扬了资本主义的方向。他把青年向科学进军的道路说成是胡海昌道路，他把服从祖国需要说成是对青年的限制和束缚，说成是封建思想的借尸还魂。他说青年没有前途，只有党员才有前途，实质上是宣扬资产阶级个人主义。他的思想在毕业同学中引起很大影响，有些同学在分配工作时过分要求生活条件，强调照顾，希望留在大城市里，使资产阶级个人主义思想得到支持。
    在钱伟长的影响下，很多人认为“万般皆下品，只有科学高”。有的学汽车五年，但毕业时却要求到力学研究所，不愿做实际工作，认为实际工作琐碎，庸庸碌碌，不易提高。试想，如果培养出来的青年，都不愿到现场做实际工作，有谁指导生产？怎能建成社会主义呢？
    宣传科学家超阶级、超政治的观点
    力学班学员王学成说，钱伟长为了走资本主义教育路线，反对成立集体教学研究组，后来他又忽然同意了，但要他当教研组主任。他主张有教学计划，可是，他是没有教学大纲的，如应用数学原计划三学期每周四小时教完，但第一学期过去后，就拖下原计划的一半。
    钱伟长还有一个说法，就是“天才教育”，学生反映功课重，他说是学生水平差，考一次刷掉二分之一到三分之一也没关系。这与社会主义有计划的培养人才，有什么相同呢？
    在钱伟长的思想影响下，使一些同学只钻业务，不问政治，他们甚至连“五一”、“国庆”的游行也不愿参加，“真是两眼不管天下事，一心只读力学书”。这是与国家要求的培养目标，多么不相称啊！
    钱伟长还向我们宣传科学家超阶级、超政治的观点。
    否定社会主义教育路线，挑拨党和科学家的关系
    吴仲华教授说：钱伟长否定社会主义教育路线，否定先进的教育制度中的教研组的组织。在科学研究方面，他想把我们拉到资本主义道路上去。他们所谓的保护科学家实际上是在诬蔑党和挑拨党和科学家的关系。大家都知道党是非常爱护科学家的，事实上绝大部分科学家是有充分的时间从事科学研究工作的。钱伟长等人建议六十岁以上的老科学家不担任行政工作，这也是非常恶劣的手段。他们的用意是想让为我们所敬爱的刘仙洲副校长、吴有训副院长等老科学家下台，他们可以取而代之。在设备问题上，他们说高等学校设备简陋，也完全是谎话，在关于培养新生力量的问题，他们建议科学家有选择培养对象的权利，这又是想把研究生据为己有的企图。
    李辑祥教授说：钱伟长讲过，他是老清华，一向是敢说敢做的，这几年来，当家做主人的感觉，越来越稀薄了。原因是党的一条线挡住了。钱伟长身兼二十多职，在旧清华做梦也想不到。但他却没有好好做好这些工作，他妄想当清华的校长，再进一步夺取高教部的领导权。钱伟长说过“系秘书专政”，但我也做过系主任，与秘书共事，却没有这种感觉。学校领导对老教授一直都是关怀的。
    耍两面手法，既不尊重老教师，又不尊重青年教师
    王遵明教授说，钱伟长在高等教育工作中，向社会主义进攻，已经有八次之多。其中一次是在教育部领导的院系调整前，钱伟长利用少数教授的落后情绪，策动在清华进行假院系调整，狂妄地想建立十院三十二系的大清华“独立王国”。钱伟长声称，这样就可以对抗国家的院系调整。他向老教授们说，他的调整计划是教育部同意的；他向教育部说，他的调整计划是教授们的共同意见。幸而拆穿了西洋镜，他的狂妄计划才没有实现。
    今年春天，高等教育部讨论教学计划，钱伟长带头向教学改革的社会主义路线进攻。
    在科学方面，钱伟长对有些科学问题不懂装懂，冒充内行，如他所说的用水泥做机床、用钱塘江口的海潮发电，这类笑话是很多的。去年全国集中人力进行的十二年科学规划是一件庄严的工作。在这庄严的工作中，他也采取抄袭、欺骗的两面派手法。钱伟长不懂农业机械，偏要写农业机械项目的规划草案，只写了二百字左右，就写不出来了。钱伟长对自动化也是外行，他却充任自动化组的组长，别人集体写的说明书，最后也改为钱伟长执笔了。
    钱伟长经常欺骗同学和教师，并进行挑拨离间。他在中国青年杂志上写着，“青年们自小在一起的好朋友因为怕被检查搞小圈子而渐渐疏远了，正当的生活爱好和业余特长受到了限制，一切都好像有顾虑，甚至吃根冰棍都可以算做生活浪费”。这难道不是污蔑吗？钱伟长在老教授之间、科学家之间相互挑拨。例如他对金希武先生当面称金老，背后则恶毒地污蔑、打击。钱伟长又对李酉山先生说：“清华有一批老家伙，也有一批小娃娃”。不尊重老教师和青年教师的就是钱伟长自己。
    否定学习苏联的成绩，把我国科学事业骂成一团糟
    邢家鲤讲师说，钱伟长对苏联的看法是否定一切，教学、科学、和工业技术都否定了。
    钱伟长空喊是学习苏联的急先锋，只是会喊口号。他心里想的什么呢？1953年他对李酉山说，我是不同意这些青年人的看法的，不过现在不说，以后再看。他用心良苦，待机而起。
    钱伟长就是打着学习苏联的旗子，而骨子里想反对党，走资本主义的老路。
    科学处秘书吕应中说，钱伟长在民主革命时期，参加了“一二九”运动，还参加了党的外围组织“民族革命先锋队”。但钱伟长在抗日战争时期却脱离了自己的组织，留在日寇统治下的天津英租界教书，再以后就干脆离开祖国去美国去读书和工作了。他就完全走上资产阶级知识分子的道路。这就是钱伟长吹嘘的进步历史！
    对于经济建设，他也认为党根本不能领导。在课堂上他也宣扬过老干部不能领导工业的谬论。他说，“工厂现在由干部掌握，不懂技术，胡乱搞，非常危险，要搞糟了。你们要学马列主义，我非常赞成，你们学好了，取得干部信任，打成一片，要取而代之！”
    王积康助教说，今年3月钱伟长就奉了曾昭抡之命乘飞机赶到太原市，说去参加科联山西分会成立大会，实际上钱伟长太原之行，是打着万能科学家的招牌，用结合中国具体情况，反对教条主义的幌子，进行了一次猖狂的反苏反共的宣传活动。
    钱伟长在山西把我国科学工作骂得淋漓尽致。然后他打着结合中国实际的旗帜，肆意污蔑苏联，赞扬美国。钱伟长以“万能科学家”自居，不懂装懂，谩骂各行科学家，污蔑今天党领导下科学工作搞得糟得很。他妄想把社会主义道路一概否定，走资本主义道路。
    张光斗教授说，钱伟长在科联山西省分会成立大会上的报告真是把他自己装成无所不知，无所不晓。我知道的很少，只知道水利方面。这方面钱伟长提的高见几乎没有一条是对的，足以证明他在这方面的无知。这就使我怀疑在其他方面的意见也是十分错误的。更严重的是这篇报告中充满了反共、反对学习苏联的言论。在水能资源的题目上，钱伟长说我们的水力资源不足，这也是错误的。我国水力资源是很丰富的，第二个五年计划中水力发电站比重要增加到40％左右。作为人民代表的钱伟长是应该知道的，而他却任意歪曲，向党进攻。在水坝的高低问题上，他也挑拨不能学习苏联。
    最后何东昌说，钱伟长是自称爱护清华的老清华人，但他要的清华是要排斥坚决走社会主义道路的人。钱伟长在校内成为右派的首领了，一切消极因素，都和他混在一起去了。钱伟长的道路是想篡改清华的政治方向，如果清华的政治方向变了，那还堪设想吗？钱伟长不是爱护清华，而是把清华推上毁灭，使学生走上黑暗的道路。
    会上发言的还有谢祖培、李欧等人。
