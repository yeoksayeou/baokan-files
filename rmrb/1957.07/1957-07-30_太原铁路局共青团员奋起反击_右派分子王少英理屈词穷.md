    Communist Youth League Members of Taiyuan Railway Bureau Rise Up in Counterattack
    Rightist Wang Shaoying Left Speechless

    (Our report) More than 40 members of the Communist Youth League from the Taiyuan Railway Administration Design Institute recently gathered to launch a forceful counterattack against the anti-Party and anti-socialist statements made by Wang Shaoying, an assistant technician in their unit.

    Wang Shaoying had wildly proclaimed, "We must kill communists, a thousand, ten thousand..." He advocated, "China should be divided in half, with the Yangtze River as the boundary. The south of the Yangtze River should be led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the north by the Communist Party. Let any country aid the Communist Party, and let the United States aid Chiang Kai-shek, and let the two sides compete." He also said, "If China were to have a 'great democracy' like Hungary, I would be an active supporter." He said, "In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, 'good people' were killed, and this cannot be left unpunished; a life should be repaid with a life." He slandered heroic figures, saying, "The sacrifices of Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and Luo Shengjiao were made with ulterior motives." He also said, "Non-Party cadres have no power; everything is decided by the Party committee, and those below are puppets. The Party does not trust the people." "Morality is not flourishing in socialist countries. People in feudal society were very trustworthy and honest. Many people today are dishonest, hypocritical, and sanctimonious..."

    The Communist Youth League members had long been unable to tolerate Wang Shaoying's absurd remarks. At the meeting, Wang Tiantang angrily said to Wang Shaoying: You say you want to divide China in half and let the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, aided by American imperialism, rule the south of the Yangtze River; this is absolutely impossible. Cui Zengqi indignantly questioned Wang Shaoying: You are a member of the Communist Youth League, and I really don't know where you stand, saying such reactionary things. You even fantasize about the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries returning to the mainland, letting the people live a life worse than that of beasts of burden again.

    At this time, Wang Shaoying still pretended to be calm and said: Everyone should help me in a gentle and mild manner, and help me according to the formula of "unity—criticism—unity."

    Wang Shaoying's arrogant attitude further aroused the anger in everyone's hearts. Cui Zengqi immediately retorted him, saying: I want to ask you, why did you say you want to kill a thousand, ten thousand Communist Party members? Is that a gentle breeze and a mild rain? Does that come from a desire for unity? Wang Shaoying was speechless and lowered his head in silence.

    At the meeting, Jin Fengyuan and Wang Tiantang refuted Wang Shaoying's absurd claim that feudal society emphasized integrity, while people in the new society are very hypocritical. Yan Fayi and Wang Senru also wrote articles to criticize Wang Shaoying's ridiculous statements.

    太原铁路局共青团员奋起反击
    右派分子王少英理屈词穷
    本报讯　太原铁路管理局设计事务所四十多名共青团员，在最近集会，向本单位助理技术员王少英的反党、反社会主义的言论，展开有力的回击。
    王少英曾猖狂地说：“要杀共产党，一千个，一万个……。”他主张：“中国应分成两半，以长江为界，长江以南归蒋介石领导，以北归共产党领导，让任何一国援助共产党，让美国援助蒋介石，双方竞争。”他还说：“中国如果也像匈牙利一样闹大民主，我是一个积极拥护者。”他说：“在镇压反革命运动中，杀了‘好人’，不能白白算了，应该以命抵命。”他诬蔑英雄人物说：“黄继光、丘少云、罗盛教的牺牲，是抱着不可告人的目的去牺牲的”。他又说：“非党干部没有权，一切都由党委决定，下边是傀儡。党不相信人民。”“社会主义国家的道德不昌盛。封建社会的人，非常讲信义，非常老实。现在的人很多不诚实，虚伪，是伪君子……”。
    共青团员们对王少英这些荒谬绝伦的言论，早已忍无可忍。在会上，王天堂愤怒地对着王少英说：你说要把中国分成两半，让蒋介石反动派在美帝国主义援助下，统治江南，这是万万办不到的。崔增琪气愤地质问王少英道：你是个共青团员，我真不知道你站在什么立场，说这些反动的话。你居然幻想蒋介石反动派回到大陆来，让人民重新过牛马不如的生活。
    这时，王少英还故作镇静地说：大家帮助我，应该和风细雨些，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式来帮助我才对。
    王少英如此傲慢的态度，更激起了大伙心头上的怒火。崔增琪立即反驳了他。说：我要问你，你为什么说要杀一千个，一万个共产党员？这难道是和风细雨吗？这难道是从团结的愿望出发吗？ 王少英哑口无言，低头不语。
    会上，金逢元、王天堂对王少英说的封建社会讲信义，新社会的人很虚伪的谬论，进行了驳斥。严发义、王森如也分别写了文章，批驳了王少英的荒谬言论。
