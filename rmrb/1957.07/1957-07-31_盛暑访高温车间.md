    Visiting High-Temperature Workshops in the Sweltering Heat

    A Waterfall in the Workshop
    This is the rolling mill workshop of the Tangshan Steel Plant. The reheating furnace in the workshop burns fiercely day and night. Next to the reheating furnace is the rolling mill. The newly rolled steel bars, sparkling with golden sparks, pass through the south wall of the workshop, where the temperature is particularly high. On July 10th of last year, it reached 77 degrees Celsius. Before the arrival of summer this year, in addition to removing the office outside the wall to increase natural ventilation, a row of water curtains more than 30 meters long was installed along the south wall. Cold water constantly flows down the water curtain, like a mountain stream waterfall. The water curtain isolates the heat. At the same time, two new 40-horsepower blowers were installed on both sides of the workshop this year. More than 70,000 cubic meters of cool air per hour are blown through thirteen blower nozzles to the workers working near the rolling mill and the shearing section. According to recent tests, the temperature in the workshop has dropped by 19 to 25 degrees Celsius compared to the same period last year. This year, the factory also provides workers with sweet and salty soda water and other cooling drinks to ensure their health.
    Asbestos Door Curtains
    In the sintering workshop of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant, rotary kilns, one after another, roll non-stop like mythical giant dragons. The temperature inside the kiln is as high as one thousand degrees Celsius. Although the fire inside the kiln is separated from the outside air by a layer of kiln skin, the radiated temperature is still very high. Some places reach as high as 100 degrees Celsius.
    In front of each kiln door, there was only one layer of asbestos kiln door curtain last year, but this year it has been changed to two layers of asbestos. This year, three more 9-horsepower exhaust fans have been added. Some places have also installed cooling pipes. Now, the kiln watchers, holding blue fire-watching mirrors, can stand less than two feet away from the raging fire inside the kiln for a few minutes without feeling too hot. In March of this year, the workers suggested punching through the brick wall on the west side of Plant A. In June, seven tall windows were newly opened on the west wall of Plant A. Yan Zhaolin, a kiln watcher at Plant A, said: "Last year, when I stood by the west wall, I felt particularly stuffy and hot; now, when I stand there, a cool breeze blows, making me feel very comfortable."
    Showers in the Workshop
    In the sintering workshop of the Tangshan Ceramics Factory, blowers are installed in front of some kiln doors that have been extinguished, blowing air into the kiln. This year, five more blowers have been added, bringing the total to twenty, including those added last year. Safety regulations stipulate that the temperature of the kiln when it is unloaded must not exceed 80 degrees Celsius. The reporter looked at some statistical tables recording the temperature of the kiln unloading this year, and they were all between 50 and 70 degrees Celsius, with 50 to 60 degrees Celsius being the most common. Although the workers felt that the temperature was much lower than before when they left the kiln, they still sweated profusely when entering the kiln to work. Therefore, the factory also supplied the workers with a large amount of soda water, and established three electric hot water shower facilities very close to the kiln. After leaving the kiln, the workers can take a warm shower without having to go far.

    盛暑访高温车间

    车间里的瀑布
    这是唐山钢厂的轧钢车间。车间内的再热炉日夜燃烧着熊熊的烈火。紧靠着再热炉就是轧钢机，刚轧好的钢条冒着金色的火星从车间南墙边穿过，这里的温度特别高。去年7月10日，达到摄氏七十七度。今年夏季到来之前，除拆除了墙外的办公室增加室内自然通风外，在靠南墙处安装了一排三十多公尺长的水幕。水幕上不断地流着清冷的水，像山涧的瀑布一般。水幕把热隔开了。同时，车间两旁今年还新安装了两台四十马力的吹风机，每小时有七万多立方公尺的凉风通过十三个吹风筒向正在轧钢机旁和剪断工段劳动的工人吹去。据最近测验，车间的温度比去年同期下降了十九度至二十五度。今年厂里还供应工人带甜味的盐汽水等清凉饮料，以保证工人健康。
    石棉门帘
    在唐山启新水泥厂的烧成车间，一个个的旋窑像神话里的巨龙般不停地在翻滚着，窑内温度高达摄氏一千好几百度。虽然窑内的火同外面空气隔着一层窑皮，但散发出来的温度仍是很高的。有的地方就到摄氏一百来度。
    每个窑门前，去年只有一层石棉窑门帘，今年改成了两层石棉。今年又增加了三台九马力的排风扇。有的地方还安上了解热管。现在，看火工人拿着蓝色的看火镜站在与窑内的烈火相距不到两尺远的地方，呆上几分钟并不感到太热。今年3月，工人建议把甲厂西边的砖墙打通，6月，甲厂西墙就新开了七个高大的窗户。甲厂看火工人颜照林说：“去年到西墙那儿一站，感到特别闷热；现在，到那儿一呆，小凉风飕飕的，吹得人特别舒服。”
    车间里的淋浴
    唐山陶瓷厂烧成车间一些住了火的窑门前，安着一台台的吹风机，呼呼地往窑内吹风。今年又增加了五台吹风机，连去年添的在内，共有二十台。保安规程上规定出窑的温度不得超过摄氏八十度。记者看了一些记载今年出窑温度的统计表，都是在五十度至七十度之间，以五十度至六十度为最多。工人出窑时虽然感到温度比以往降低了很多，但进入窑内劳动还是汗流浃背。因此，厂里又大量供应工人汽水，而且在离窑很近的地方建立了三处电热水的淋浴设备。出窑工人下班后，不用远走就可洗个温水澡。
