Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th – The successive flood peaks of the Yellow River, each larger than the last, have entered Shandong. The vast population along the river in Shandong Province and the flood prevention organizations at all levels have begun an intense battle against the flood. More than 200,000 organized flood prevention personnel from Liaocheng, Heze, Huimin and other special districts, and Jinan City along the river, have taken shovels, carrying baskets, wooden stakes and other flood prevention materials to the dikes. The Shandong Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters has specially dispatched more than 3,000 Yellow River engineering personnel for specialized defense. Before the arrival of the flood peak, the Party and government organizations at all levels along the river also helped the residents in the Yellow River滩 (river flats) to prepare for relocation and rescue work.

Now, the floodwaters in all river sections above Aishan in Dong'e County, Shandong Province, have overflowed the滩 (river flats), and all sections from Aishan to the estuary are close to the guaranteed water level. According to meteorological forecasts, the river basins of the Yellow River tributaries Yi River, Luo River, Qin River, and Wen River in Shandong will continue to experience rainfall in the coming days, and the water situation of the Yellow River is still developing. Party and government leaders of all special districts and counties along the river in Shandong Province have personally gone to the dikes to lead the flood prevention teams to patrol the dikes day and night, and to monitor the development of the water situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th – At 7:00 PM on the 19th, an even larger flood peak appeared at Huayuankou on the Yellow River, with a flow rate of 13,000 cubic meters per second. This flow rate was maintained until it began to decrease at 12:00 PM on the 19th, returning to over 12,000 cubic meters per second. At 8:00 AM on the 20th, it was 10,000 cubic meters per second, at 9:00 AM it was 11,400 cubic meters per second, and at 12:00 PM it was 10,500 cubic meters per second.

Downstream of Dongbatou in Lankao County, the river water has overflowed onto the滩 (river flats) within the dikes.

Party and government leading cadres in eastern Henan and along the Yellow River in Shandong have all led the masses to the dikes to defend against the flood.

The DaWen River, a tributary of the Yellow River in Shandong, has risen sharply. On the afternoon of the 19th, the floodwaters were diverted into the Daotunwa flood detention area. Due to the diversion of the DaWen River, Dongping Lake has not exceeded the guaranteed water level.

    黄河洪峰进入山东  沿河人民紧张防汛
    新华社济南20日电　黄河接连到来的、一次比一次大的洪峰已进入山东，山东省沿河广大人民和各级防汛组织已开始紧张的防汛战斗。沿河聊城、菏泽、惠民等专区和济南市的二十余万有组织的防汛队伍，已携带铁锨、抬筐、木桩等防汛器材陆续上堤。山东省防汛指挥部特派出三千多名黄河工程人员作专门防守。在洪峰到来之前，沿河各级党政组织还帮助黄河滩内的居民，做好了迁移和抢救的准备工作。
    现在山东省东阿县艾山以上各河段洪水都已漫滩，艾山以下至海口也都接近保证水位。据气象台预报，近几天黄河支流伊洛河、沁河和山东汶河等河流域，将继续降雨，黄河水情仍在发展中。山东省沿河各专区、县的党政负责人都已亲自上堤，带领防汛队伍日夜巡查堤防，并监视水情的发展。
    新华社郑州20日电　19日下午七时，黄河花园口又紧接着出现了一次更大的洪峰，流量达一万三千秒公方。这个流量维持到19日下午十二时开始下降，回到一万二千多秒公方。20日上午八时为一万秒公方，九时为一万一千四百秒公方，十二时为一万零五百秒公方。
    兰考县东坝头以下河水已经漫上了堤内的滩地。
    豫东和山东沿河各地的党政领导干部，都已领导群众上堤防守。
    山东境内的黄河支流大汶河猛涨，19日下午，洪水已分泄入导屯洼滞洪区。由于大汶河分洪，现在东平湖还没有超过保证水位。
