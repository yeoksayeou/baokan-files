Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 21st: Guangdong Province, which accounts for the largest area of early rice cultivation in the country, has achieved a historical high in production this year. The total output is expected to exceed 7 billion jin, an increase of approximately 200 million jin compared to last year. The province is now in the midst of the busy season of harvesting early rice.

All seven special districts and the Hainan region, with the exception of the Huiyang Special District which suffered severe flooding and reduced production, have increased production. The Foshan Special District, a major grain-producing area, is expected to increase production by about 100 million jin. Among them, the Shatin area in the Pearl River Delta, which has had consecutive years of bumper harvests, generally has a yield of 330 jin per mu, about 50 jin more than last year. The five counties of Jieyang, Chao'an, Chenghai, Puning, and Chaoyang, which have been honored with the title of "Thousand-Jin Grain County," have all achieved increased production.
