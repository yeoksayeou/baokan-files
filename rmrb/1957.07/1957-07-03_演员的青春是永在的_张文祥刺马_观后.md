    "An Actor's Youth is Eternal"
    ——After Seeing "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma"
    Feng Zi
    Just as the theatrical circles of the capital are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the spoken drama movement, the popular spoken drama, with its fifty-year history, is bringing its traditional repertoire to showcase and perform, providing Beijing's drama enthusiasts and drama workers with an opportunity to observe and learn. This is truly great news.
    On the evening of June 23rd, the Popular Spoken Drama Troupe invited the Beijing literary and art circles to perform one of its traditional repertoire, "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma." Elderly people who have lived from the late Qing Dynasty to the present day are familiar with the story of "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma," because this play reflects Qing Dynasty affairs. It is an excellent tradition of popular spoken drama to reflect current realities in a timely manner through dramatic form and to expose the contradictions in real life. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the vast ranks of spoken drama troupes, whether in the base areas, behind enemy lines, or in the rear areas, all inherited and carried forward this tradition in promoting unity against the enemy.
    Today, when we watch "Zhang Wenxiang Assassinates Ma," even though it depicts events from fifty years ago, the audience breathes with the characters in the play. Why is that? Because the play is written in such a concentrated and sharp way as to expose contradictions, revealing the class contradictions of feudal society through the conflicts between the characters. A greater feature is the vividness of the characters, and the character development gradually deepens with the development of the contradictions. The depiction of character and the explanation of character relationships are conveyed and depicted through actions. This feature is what those engaged in drama, especially today's drama actors, are painstakingly pursuing. The actors of the Popular Spoken Drama Troupe, especially the senior actors, deserve our study in their achievements in this area.
    Speaking of senior actors, the oldest actor coming to Beijing this time is eighty-three years old, and many more are in their fifties and sixties. They are older, they have rich experience, both life and artistic practice experience; they are amazingly displaying the youth of art on today's stage. This short article cannot introduce them one by one, especially since I only saw one play. In this play alone, such as Wang Manjun's Zhang Wenxiang, Tian Chi's Dou Yihu, Liu Yixin's Ma Xinyi, and Wang Xueyan's Xiao Hehua, as well as other actors in other roles, truly every character has a unique image! Take Tian Chi's Dou Yihu, for example. Tian Chi is not acting; he is indeed creating a living person! Tian Chi has brought to life a Dou Yihu who is both rugged and simple, with such a complete character! People care about Dou Yihu's fate, and the theater constantly emits laughter and sighs, and even applause. See to what extent the actor's artistic magic is displayed!
    I also want to talk about Wang Xueyan's Xiao Hehua. I don't know her age, but when the character lives on the stage, what appears on the stage is a twenty-year-old woman of the pleasure quarter. If you close your eyes and listen to her speak, her voice is so delicate and young! That voice also makes people believe what a young and lovely woman she is! It is said that Wang Xueyan created a girl of ten or so years old in another play; I am waiting to see her characters of different ages and personalities.
    After watching the performance of the Popular Spoken Drama Troupe, I observed the acting skills of many senior performers; the artistic magic of these senior performers proves that "an actor's youth is eternal"!

    “演员的青春是永在的”
    ——“张文祥刺马”观后
    凤子
    正当首都戏剧界纪念话剧运动五十年，而有了五十年历史的通俗话剧，带着它的传统剧目来展览演出，使得北京爱好话剧的观众和话剧工作者有了观摩和学习的机会，真是一个大喜讯。
    6月23日晚，通俗话剧团招待北京文艺界演出了传统剧目之一“张文祥刺马”。从清朝末年生活到今天的老年人，对“张文祥刺马”的故事是熟悉的，因为这个戏反映的是清朝时事。以戏剧形式及时地反映当前的现实，揭露现实生活中的矛盾，是通俗话剧的优秀传统。在抗日战争时期，广大的话剧队伍，不论是在根据地、敌后、或大后方，在宣传团结抗敌上，都是继承并发扬了这一传统的。
    今天我们看“张文祥刺马”，虽然这是五十年前的时事，而观众们却是和剧中人共呼吸的。为什么呢？因为这个戏在编写上是那样集中而尖锐地揭露了矛盾，通过人物之间的冲突揭露了封建社会的阶级矛盾。更大一个特点是人物性格鲜明，而人物性格是随着矛盾的发展而逐步深化的。人物性格的描写和人物关系的交代，是用动作来交代来描写的。这一特点是从事戏剧的、特别是今天的话剧演员们所苦苦追求的。通俗话剧团的演员们，尤其是几位老演员们，在这方面的造诣值得我们好好学习。
    提到老演员，这次来京的最老一位演员有八十三岁，更多的是五十、六十多岁的。他们年长，他们有丰富的经验，生活的和艺术实践的经验；他们在今天的舞台上是惊人地发挥着艺术的青春。这篇短文不可能一一介绍，何况只看了一个戏。就在这个戏里，如王曼君的张文祥，田驰的窦一虎，刘一新的马新贻和王雪艳的小荷花，还有其他演员的其他角色，真是每一个人物有他独特的形象！就说田驰的窦一虎吧，田驰不是演戏，的确是创造了一个活生生的人！田驰把一个性格粗犷而又纯朴的窦一虎演活了，人物性格那样完整！人们关心着窦一虎的命运，剧场不断发出笑声和叹息，甚至是掌声。请看演员的艺术魔力发挥到什么样的程度！
    我还要谈一谈王雪艳的小荷花，她本人的年龄我不清楚；可是，当角色生活在舞台上，舞台上出现的就是一位二十岁的青楼中人。假如闭上眼睛听她说话，她的声音是那样的娇柔年轻！那声音也叫人不能不相信她是一个多么年轻可爱的女人！据说王雪艳在别的戏里创造了一个十来岁的小姑娘；我等着看她的不同年龄、性格的人物。
    看了通俗话剧团的演出，观摩了许多位老前辈的演技；这些位老前辈们的艺术的魔力，证实了“演员的青春是永在的”！
