Building a Railway on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
Aerial Survey Work for the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Basically Completed

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 25th: The aerial survey work for the world's highest railway—the Qinghai-Tibet Railway—has been basically completed.

Chinese technicians and Soviet experts assisting in the aerial survey have preliminarily indicated, based on aerial photographs, that although the altitude for building a railway on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is very high, the terrain is not too steep. There are better passes and river valleys in the Tanggula and Kunlun Mountains, which will allow the railway line to pass smoothly. The future Qinghai-Tibet Railway will be a relatively ideal railway that meets the requirements of a trunk line.

The Qinghai-Tibet Railway is more than 1,300 kilometers long from Golmud to Lhasa. The aerial photography work has now been completed, with a photographic area of nearly 50,000 square kilometers. The work of measuring ground height using radio waves has also been basically completed, except for individual areas.

When reporters visited the Lanzhou base of the aerial survey team, indoor staff were working intensely to sort out the photos and mark the heights. Thousands upon thousands of continuously taken photographs need to be meticulously connected to form a long strip of aerial images from Golmud to Lhasa. The ground features included in the images are more than 60 kilometers wide in some places and 5 kilometers wide in narrow places. In the future, when designers sit in the office and browse the aerial images, it will be like flying over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, enabling them to accurately study and select railway line options.

The arduous railway aerial survey work, which began in November last year, was carried out with the full assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union sent specially equipped aircraft and twenty experienced experts; the new Soviet scientific achievement—radio wave leveling—was also successfully applied in the aerial survey.

### 把铁路修上青藏高原  青藏铁路的航测工作基本完成

    把铁路修上青藏高原
    青藏铁路的航测工作基本完成
    据新华社兰州25日电　世界上最高的铁路——青藏铁路的航测工作已经基本完成。
    我国技术人员和帮助航测的苏联专家，根据航空拍摄的相片初步研究指出，在青藏高原上修筑铁路拔海虽然很高，但是地势并不太陡。唐古拉山和昆仑山上有较佳的?口和河谷，可以让铁路线顺利通过。未来的青藏铁路将是一条比较理想、合乎干线要求的铁路。
    青藏铁路从噶尔穆到拉萨计长一千三百多公里。现在空中摄影工作已经结束，摄影面积将近有五万平方公里；利用无线电波测量地面高度的工作，除个别地区以外，也已基本完成。
    记者访问航测队兰州基地时，室内工作人员正在紧张地整理相片，并且标明高度。千千万万张连续拍摄的照相，要很细致地联接起来，成为一条从噶尔穆到拉萨的航空图片长带。图片包括的地面景物，宽的地方有六十多公里，窄的地方也有五公里。以后，设计人员坐在办公室里翻阅航空图片时，就好像飞行在青藏高原上空，能够准确地研究和选择铁路的线路方案。
    从去年11月开始的艰巨的铁路航测工作，是在苏联全面帮助下进行的。苏联派来了特殊装备的飞机和二十位富有经验的专家；苏联科学上的新成就——无线电波抄平，也在航测中应用成功。
