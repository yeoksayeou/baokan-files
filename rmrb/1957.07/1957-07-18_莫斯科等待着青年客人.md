Moscow Awaits Young Guests
By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui

These days, many newspapers in Moscow are prominently announcing to readers daily: "Only ×× days left until the 6th World Youth Festival." The festival is approaching day by day. Muscovites are joyfully and excitedly preparing for this grand and happy occasion.

In this city, known as the "City of the Festival," you can feel a festive atmosphere everywhere you go. "Festival" ("Fisivaly") has become the most popular word in Moscow. When people talk about "Festival," their joyful mood immediately overflows. Festival posters and the festival's flower-shaped badge have become the most fashionable decorations in Moscow. People put various posters on the streets and hang them in shop windows; they print the flower-shaped badge on candy boxes and hang it in windows or on balconies, using colorful flowers and plants to embroider it in the park's flowerbeds. The stations on Komsomolskaya Square are being repainted, as many foreign delegations will disembark here. Dzerzhinsky Park is being decorated, where young people from Asia and Africa will meet.

Moscow is making proper arrangements for the accommodation, food, and transportation of tens of thousands of young guests. To provide young guests with comfortable accommodation, a "hotel city" has been set up in the northeastern district of Moscow. This "hotel city" consists of fifty-three buildings, each capable of housing about five hundred people. Thus, this "hotel city" will host thirty thousand guests. In addition, the one thousand and twenty-six rooms of the newly built "Ukraine" Hotel on the banks of the Moscow River will also be used to receive young guests. Dining places for young guests are also being arranged. We saw that next to the "Golden Wheat Ear" restaurant in the "hotel city," temporary canteens with green striped canvas roofs are being built. There are twenty-two such temporary canteens in the "hotel city," each capable of accommodating five hundred people at the same time; all temporary canteens can accommodate eleven thousand people at the same time. Throughout Moscow, nine restaurants, eighty-seven canteens, and many cafes and snack bars have also been prepared for young guests. Moscow has also prepared one thousand three hundred buses and six hundred cars for the use of young guests.

How are the hosts of the festival – the young people of Moscow – preparing for this grand festival? To understand this aspect, we visited Comrade Stukalin, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Komsomol. He told us: All Komsomol organizations in Moscow are making preparations for the festival their central task at present. Young people in many factories and schools in Moscow are responsible for beautifying the streets. Currently, the Komsomol Municipal Committee is organizing an inter-district competition for this work, and the best-decorated district will receive a first prize – a "Volga" car. At present, preparations are underway in all districts of Moscow. On July 29, young workers and students in Moscow will hold separate get-togethers with young foreign representatives by district. Chinese youth representatives will be honored guests of the youth in the Proletarsky District; Indian youth representatives will be invited by the youth in the May Day District; Egyptian youth representatives will be guests of the youth in the Moskvoretsky District; and youth representatives from the United States, Britain, and Germany will be received by the youth in the Soviet District, Leningrad District, and Zhdanov District, respectively. To make this youth festival more beautiful and to add to its atmosphere of peace and friendship, Moscow's youth have prepared a large number of flowers, thirty thousand pigeons, and five hundred thousand gifts. At the same time, the youth of Moscow are also dedicating voluntary labor as a gift to the festival. They have universally participated in various tasks of tidying up and decorating the environment, and have newly opened a "Friendship Park" in the Leningrad District especially for the festival.

Two days ago, we visited the Proletarsky District of Moscow and learned about their preparations for the festival from Comrade Polischuk, Secretary of the Komsomol District Committee.

The Proletarsky District is an industrial district in Moscow. There are many large factories here, including the famous Likhachev Automobile Factory. During the revolutionary period, the workers of this district always stood at the forefront of the struggle. After the October Revolution, Lenin often came here and delivered speeches to the workers at the Dynamo Factory. At the same time, the workers of the Proletarsky District have a deep friendship with the Chinese workers. The Likhachev Automobile Factory has maintained close ties with China's Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Engineers from the Likhachev factory have gone to China's Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant to provide technical guidance; the second "Liberation" brand truck from the Changchun Automobile Factory was given to the Likhachev factory and is still displayed in the factory's sample room. During the festival, this district, which has an excellent revolutionary tradition and a deep friendship with China, will be responsible for receiving young guests from China.

The youth of the Proletarsky District are working hard to prepare for the festival and welcome young Chinese guests. As of July 11, the youth team of the Likhachev Automobile Factory had produced ninety-four very beautiful new glass-roofed buses ahead of schedule for the festival. Two youth teams from the Dynamo Factory also used their spare time to equip a "Moscow Festival" coal mining machine, which they plan to give to the young Chinese representatives. They noted the date of arrival of each batch of young Chinese guests in Moscow and prepared to greet them. They have also prepared many wonderful programs to celebrate with the young Chinese people. On July 14, the youth of Moscow warmly welcomed the first group of young guests – the twenty-seven members of the Chinese Youth Sports Team.

Two years ago, when the 5th World Youth Festival in Warsaw closed and the youth representatives of various countries shook hands to say goodbye, they said, "Goodbye, friends, see you in Moscow!" Two years have passed quickly. In a few days, young people from more than one hundred and forty countries from the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, and from the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, will meet in this city of peace and friendship.

    莫斯科等待着青年客人
    本报记者  程光锐
    这些天，莫斯科的许多报纸，都在显著的地位逐日向读者预告：“到第六届世界青年联欢节还有××天”。联欢节一天天接近了。莫斯科人正在愉快而又紧张地迎接这个盛大的欢乐的节日。
    在这座被称为“联欢节的城市”里，目前你到处可以感到一种节日前夕的气氛。“菲斯齐瓦里”（联欢节）已成为莫斯科最流行的言语。人们在谈起“菲斯齐瓦里”的时候，那种愉快的心情马上就溢于言表。联欢节的招贴画和联欢节的梅花形徽章已成为莫斯科最时髦的装饰品。人们把各色各样的招贴画贴在街头上，挂在橱窗里；把梅花形徽章印在糖果盒上，悬在窗口或凉台上，用五颜六色的花草绣在公园的花圃里。共青团广场上的几个车站正在粉刷，许多外国代表团将在这里下车。捷尔任斯基公园正在布置，亚非国家的青年们将在这里会见。
    莫斯科正在为几万青年客人的住、食、行进行妥善的安排。为了使青年客人们有个安适的住所，在莫斯科东北区，一座“旅馆城”已经布置起来。这个“旅馆城”是由五十三座大楼组成的，每座大楼里约可住五百人。这样，这个“旅馆城”的客人将达三万人。此外，莫斯科河畔新建的“乌克兰”旅馆的一千零二十六个房间，也将用来接待青年客人。青年客人们的饮食处所也正在安排。我们看到“旅馆城”中“金色麦穗”饭店旁边，正在搭盖用绿条帆布做篷顶的临时食堂。像这样的临时食堂，在“旅馆城”中有二十二个，每个可以容纳五百人同时用餐；全部临时食堂可以容纳一万一千人同时用餐。在莫斯科全市还为青年客人们准备了九个餐厅、八十七个食堂以及很多的咖啡座和小吃部。莫斯科还准备了一千三百辆公共汽车和六百辆小汽车给青年客人们使用。
    联欢节的主人——莫斯科的青年是怎样准备这个盛大节日的呢？为着了解这方面的情况，我们访问了共青团莫斯科市委书记斯图卡林同志。他告诉我们：莫斯科所有的共青团组织都把联欢节的准备工作作为目前的中心任务。莫斯科许多工厂和学校青年负责美化街道的工作，目前共青团市委正在组织这项工作的区际竞赛，装饰得最好的区将得到优等奖——一辆“伏尔加”牌小汽车。目前，莫斯科各个区的准备工作都在紧张地进行。7月29日那一天，莫斯科的青年工人和学生，将分区同外国青年代表们进行联欢。中国青年代表将成为无产阶级区青年的贵宾；印度青年代表将受到五一区青年的邀请；埃及青年代表将到莫斯科河区青年那里去作客；美国、英国和德国的青年代表们，将分别受到苏维埃区、列宁格勒区和日丹诺夫区青年们的接待。为了使这个青年人的节日更美丽，为了增添它的和平和友谊的气氛，莫斯科的青年们已经准备好了大批的鲜花、三万只鸽子和五十万件礼物。同时，莫斯科的青年们还以义务劳动作为对联欢节的献礼。他们普遍地参加了整理和布置环境的各项工作，并且在列宁格勒区特别为联欢节新辟了一个“友谊公园”。
    我们在两天前访问了莫斯科的无产阶级区，从共青团区委书记波立树克同志那里了解到他们准备联欢节的情况。
    无产阶级区是莫斯科的一个工业区。这里有许多大工厂，著名的利哈乔夫汽车工厂就在这个区里。在革命时期，这个区的工人一直站在斗争的最前列。十月革命后，列宁常到这里来，并且在这里的狄纳摩工厂对工人们发表过演说。同时，无产阶级区的工人们同中国工人有着深厚的友谊。利哈乔夫汽车工厂同我国长春第一汽车制造厂一直保持着密切的联系。利哈乔夫工厂的工程师曾到我国长春第一汽车制造厂去进行过技术指导；长春汽车厂的第二辆“解放牌”汽车就送给了利哈乔夫工厂，现在还摆在这个工厂的样品间里。在联欢节期间，这个具有优秀革命传统、同中国有着深厚友谊的区，将负责接待来自中国的青年客人们。
    无产阶级区的青年正在紧张地进行联欢节的准备工作和迎接中国青年客人们。到7月11日为止，利哈乔夫汽车工厂的青年工作队，已提前生产了九十四辆十分美观的新型玻璃顶公共汽车，供给联欢节使用。狄纳摩工厂的两个青年工作队，也利用业余时间装备了一辆“莫斯科联欢节号”挖煤机，准备送给中国的青年代表们。他们记下了每一批中国青年客人们到达莫斯科的日期，准备前往迎接。他们还准备好了许多精彩的节目，以便同中国青年们联欢。7月14日，莫斯科的青年们热情地迎接了第一批青年客人——中国青年体育队的二十七名队员。
    两年前，当华沙第五届世界青年联欢节闭幕后，各国青年代表们握手告别的时候，曾经说，“再见吧，朋友，莫斯科见！”两年的时间很快地过去了。再过几天，来自寒带、温带和热带，来自东半球和西半球的一百四十多个国家的青年，就要在这个和平和友谊的城市见面了。（附图片）
