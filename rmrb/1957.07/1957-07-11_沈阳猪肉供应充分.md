Market Watch

    Since July, Shenyang residents can still buy fresh pork in the afternoon without having to queue. Since the fourth quarter of last year, ordinary residents have had difficulty buying pork, except during holidays. Recently, with the improvement of national hog production, the central government and Liaoning Province decided to transfer 89,000 hogs to Shenyang from other provinces and counties in the third quarter. Coupled with the Shenyang Food Company's inventory and purchases from the suburbs, there are a total of 100,800 hogs, an increase of 63% compared with the same period last year. An average of 800 hogs are released into the market every day, which can fully supply the needs of citizens. Therefore, the rationing method, which was implemented for a period in June, has been cancelled.

    沈阳猪肉供应充分
    7月以来，沈阳市民在下午仍然可以买到新鲜的猪肉，而且不用排队了。这里自去年第四季以来，除了节日，一般居民很难买到猪肉。最近随着全国生猪生产的好转，中央和辽宁省决定在第三季度从外省、外县调给沈阳市生猪八万九千头，加上沈阳市食品公司库存和市郊采购，共有生猪十万零八千头，比去年同期增加63％。每天投放市场的生猪平均有八百头，可以充分供应市民需要，因此在6月份一度实行的定量供应的办法已经取消。
