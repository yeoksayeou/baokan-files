Today's Yellow River Flood Area

In 1938, when Japan invaded China, the Kuomintang reactionaries resisted passively and did not hesitate to sacrifice the property of millions of people in Henan, breaching the dikes at Huayuankou to release the Yellow River, bringing nine years of severe suffering from floods to the people of Henan. After the Communist Party liberated the area, it promptly organized the disaster victims to reclaim land and engage in production, and built various water conservancy projects. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the lives of the people in the Yellow River Flood Area have greatly changed today.

South of Huayuankou, the Yellow River turned thousands of acres of fertile land into barren, weed-choked disaster areas. The masses, who had just returned home with no food to eat, searched everywhere for grass roots and wild vegetables that could fill their stomachs. The days of hunger and cold lasted for nine whole years in some areas. Nine years passed, and the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party fought to the Yellow River Flood Area. The masses who had fled famine heard that their hometown had been liberated and returned home one after another to participate in production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    This is the newly built Huayuankou Yellow River silt irrigation canal head gate, which enables 260,000 mu of farmland in Zhongmu and the suburbs of Zhengzhou, which used to suffer from the Yellow River, to be irrigated with Yellow River water. This is also the place where Chiang Kai-shek dug the Yellow River embankment nineteen years ago. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhenyan

    The Communist Party leads the people to rebuild their homes, and the Yellow River Flood Area has undergone fundamental changes. In the areas overgrown with weeds and infested with wild animals due to the Yellow River floods, the fruit trees planted after liberation are now bearing abundant fruit.

    Grandma Jin of Nanling Commune in Xihua County, Henan, fled with her entire family of eight during the third flood after the Yellow River breach in 1942. Her son starved to death, and her daughter-in-law was abducted by bandits. Now, Grandma Jin's entire family (seven people) have joined the agricultural cooperative as the flooded area changes, and have begun a new life.

    Nine years of Yellow River flooding caused most of the young people in the flooded area to flee famine, wasting their time and delaying their schooling. Today, every agricultural cooperative in the Yellow River Flood Area has a school. This is Nanling Primary School.

    今日的黄泛区
    1938年当日本进侵我国时，国民党反动派消极抵抗，不惜河南千百万人民的财产，竟在花园口决堤放出黄河之水，给河南人民带来了九年水患的深重灾难。共产党解放该地后，及时组织灾民开荒生产，并修建各项水利工程。在共产党领导下，今天黄泛区人民的生活已经大大变了样。
    在花园口以南的地方，黄水把千里良田变成为荒草无棵的灾区，刚刚回家无粮充饥的群众到处寻找可能充饥的草根和野菜。饥寒交迫的日子，在有些地区整整延续了九年。九年过去了，共产党领导的人民解放军打到了黄泛区，外出逃荒的群众听到家乡解放，纷纷还乡参加生产。　（新华社稿）
    这是泛区农民成群结队赶着自己的大车前往县粮食站缴纳公粮。

    共产党领导人民重建家园，黄泛区从根本上变了样。因黄水泛滥造成的杂草丛生、野兽出没的地方，解放后栽植的果树已结果累累。

    河南西华县南凌社金老太太，于1942年黄河掘口后第三次发水，全家老小八口人逃荒在外，儿子饿死，儿媳被土匪抢走。现在金老太太全家（七口人）随着泛区的变化，参加了农业合作社，开始了新的生活。
