    Visiting "Cotton City"
    By our correspondent Su Lan
    The British often say that May brings good weather. But in Manchester, we encountered days of overcast skies and drizzling rain, with hardly a sunny day. Once, taking advantage of a break in the rain, a British friend took us to Oldham. This small town is located on a hill northeast of Manchester. It is said that from the center of town, one can look down and see countless chimneys, although half of them no longer emit smoke. Unfortunately, when we arrived there, it started raining again, and all the chimneys disappeared into a misty rain.
    In the following two days, we visited Rochdale, Bury, Bolton, Preston, and Blackburn, all located north and northwest of Manchester. These towns are all in rolling hills. Well-maintained roads connect the towns. Factories are tightly packed between towns, with chimneys everywhere. The British call these towns "Cotton City."
    Manchester is like a large magnet, firmly attracting the large and small "Cotton Cities" within a hundred miles around it. And Liverpool, as a seaport for importing raw cotton and exporting textiles, maintains the closest ties with Manchester. All of this makes Lancashire the center of the textile industry in England.
    "England's bread depends on Lancashire's cotton yarn," this slogan was retained on the walls of Lancashire's towns until 1945. From this slogan, one can imagine the position the textile industry held in England in the past. Today, people rarely mention it. The cotton textile industry now presents a scene of desolation and decline.
    The current situation of the textile industry in England can be seen from the following figures: since 1952, at least 190 textile factories in Lancashire have closed down. The number of textile workers has decreased from 334,000 to 247,000. 20,000 workers are in a state of semi-unemployment, working only four, three, or even two days a week. Since two-thirds of textile workers are women, and most of them are elderly, once they lose their lifelong expertise, it is difficult for them to transfer to other industrial sectors. Therefore, for these people, dismissal means long-term unemployment. A female worker once told me that before the war, most of the cotton fabrics produced in the small town of Bury were exported to China. Now, due to the reduction in production, a large number of workers are unemployed, and people are dispersing and moving elsewhere year after year. When we arrived in Rochdale, a female worker also told me that their working week has now been reduced from five days to four days.
    Why is the textile industry gradually declining? There are two different opinions in England. Some say that the main reason is foreign competition, especially the free flow of cotton textiles from Japan, India, and Hong Kong into England. These people also cite examples: in the first half of 1956 alone, cotton cloth imported from India reached 146 million square yards, while imports from Hong Kong increased to 52.5 million square yards. This figure reached a quarter of the total cotton textile production in England. This "unfair competition" has caused British cotton textiles to decline sharply again and again.
    But others do not see it that way. They believe that the fundamental reason is that the Conservative government's arms expansion policy has hit the textile industry. The British government and the textile giants no longer care about this industry. They reject plans to modernize the textile industry and refuse to make any technical reforms. In 1956, the profits of the Lancashire textile industry were 5 million pounds. Although this was 3 million pounds less than in 1955, the amount was still considerable. After the capitalists put this large sum of money into their own pockets, they only took out 5% for reinvestment.
    When I was in Rochdale, I met two old workers. Galatt, 63, and Meade, 57, both entered cotton mills at the age of twelve. They lamented that they have been working for decades, and now they are still using old machines and old methods for production. Meade is still using the cotton spinning machine that his grandmother used to work on. Under these circumstances, factories producing new types of textile machines are closing down one after another. A textile machinery factory in Manchester with more than 2,000 workers closed down two years ago because it had no orders.
    These two old workers, who have experienced the storms of economic crises, told me a lot about the lives of workers. Meade said: During the economic crisis years from 1929 to 1932, the lives of workers were very hard. At that time, the nominal weekly wage for a couple was 26 shillings, but after deducting insurance fees, only 18 shillings were left. Nowadays, the lives of workers are much better than at that time. However, what textile workers worry about is: "How long can this kind of life last?" They are afraid of factory closures and afraid of unemployment. The elderly have fresh memories of past painful experiences and are no longer willing to send their children to textile factories. Young people believe that the textile industry has lost its future and prefer to engage in other industries. Someone conducted a survey in Bolton: young men put the textile industry in sixth place when choosing a career; while young women put it in third place. It is said that in the entire textile industry in Lancashire, the average age of workers is 45, and there is a great concern about the lack of successors.
    When talking about trade with China, both workers and capitalists expressed great interest. They are concerned about such questions: "Now that China's industry has developed, will it still need our textiles?" "What items can China exchange with us?" Once, when we were chatting with textile capitalist Silvan, we mentioned that trade between China and Japan is gradually recovering. He said with great emotion: "From an economic point of view, this is really terrible for us!"
    The old buildings of Manchester, blackened by coal smoke, the chimneys around it that have stopped smoking, the worried old workers... all interwoven into a picture of the decline of the British textile industry. This industry was once called "the starting point of the British industrial revolution"; now, it seems to be coming to the end of its history. (Attached picture)

### 访问“棉城”

    访问“棉城”
    本报记者　苏蓝
    英国人常说，五月会带来好天气。可是我们在曼彻斯特所遇到的，却是连日阴云密布，细雨蒙蒙，难得有一个晴天。有一次，趁天不下雨，一位英国朋友领我们到奥尔德汉姆去。这个小城镇座落在曼彻斯特东北部的一个山岗上。据说，从城镇中心居高临下，可以看到周围数不尽的烟囱，虽然如今已经有一半不再吐出青烟。不幸的是，当我们到达那里时，天又降雨，所有的烟囱都消失在一片茫茫雾雨之中。
    往后的两天，我们先后到过曼彻斯特北部和西北部的罗契台尔、布里、波尔顿、普累斯顿和勃拉克本。这些城镇，都在起伏不平的丘陵地带。修得不坏的公路，把一个个城镇串连起来。城镇与城镇之间，工厂紧连，烟囱密布。英国人就把这些城镇称之谓“棉城”。
    曼彻斯特就像一块大磁石，把它方圆百里之内的大大小小的“棉城”紧紧吸在自己周围。而利物浦，作为输入原棉和纺织品出口的海港，和曼彻斯特保持着最密切的联系。所有这一切，就使兰开夏郡成为英国的纺织业中心。
    “英国的面包依靠着兰开夏的棉纱”，这个标语在兰开夏大小城镇的墙壁上，一直保留到1945年。从这个标语中，可以想像得到纺织工业过去在英国占据着什么样的地位。而今天，人们已经很少提到它了。棉纺织业如今呈现在人们面前的是一片萧条和没落的景象。
    英国现在纺织业的情况，可以从下面一些数字中看出来，从1952年到现在，在兰开夏至少有一百九十家纺织厂关了门。纺织工人由三十三万四千人减少到二十四万七千人。有两万工人处于半失业状态，他们每周只能工作四天、三天甚至两天。由于纺织工人中三分之二是妇女，而且多半是上了年纪的，她们一旦失掉了平生专长的劳动，就很难再转移到其它工业部门中去。因此，对这些人来说，解雇就意味着长期失业。一位女工曾告诉我，在战前，布里这个小城镇生产的棉织品，大部输向中国。现在，由于生产的缩减，工人大量的失业，人们一年比一年多地向别处流散、转移。当我们到罗契台尔的时候，也有一位女工告诉我，现在她们每周的工作日，已由五天减少到四天。
    为什么纺织业逐步走向没落呢？在英国存在着两种不同的意见。有些人说，主要原因是国外的竞争，特别是日本、印度和香港的棉纺织品自由流入英国。这些人还举例说：只在1956年上半年，从印度输入的棉布就达到一亿四千六百万平方码，而从香港输入的则增加到五千二百五十万平方码。这个数字，达到了英国整个棉纺织生产的四分之一。这种“不公道的竞争”，就使英国棉纺织品一再激烈下降。
    而另外一些人，却不是这样看的。他们认为根本原因是保守党政府的扩军政策使得纺织业受到打击。英国政府和纺织业的巨头们，已经不再关心这种工业。他们拒绝使纺织业现代化的计划，拒绝作任何技术上的改革。1956年，兰开夏纺织工业的利润为五百万英镑。这虽然比1955年少了三百万镑，数目仍然可观。资本家们把这一大笔钱装进自己的腰包之后，却只拿出了5％来从事再投资。
    当我在罗契台尔的时候，遇见了两位老工人。六十三岁的加拉特和五十七岁的米德，都是从十二岁起就走进棉纺厂的。他们感叹地说，他们工作了几十年，如今还是用老机器、老办法来生产。米德现在所用的还是他祖母工作过的那台棉纺机。在这种情况下，生产新型纺织机的工厂一个接着一个地倒闭了。曼彻斯特一个拥有二千多工人的纺织机械厂，就是因为没有订货在两年前关了门。
    这两位经历过经济危机风暴的老工人，告诉我许多关于工人生活的情况。米德说：在1929年到1932年的经济危机年代，工人的生活苦得很。当时，夫妇两人每周的工资，名义上是二十六个先令，但扣除了保险费就只剩下十八个先令。如今，工人的生活比那时是好得多了。但是，纺织工人们担心的是：“这样的生活能维持多久？”他们害怕工厂倒闭，害怕失业。老年人对以往的痛苦经历记忆犹新，不再愿意把自己的儿女送到纺织厂去。青年人认为纺织工业失掉了前途，宁愿从事其它行业。有人在波尔顿作过一次调查：年轻男人在选择职业时，把纺织业放在第六位；而年轻妇女则把它放在第三位。据说，在兰开夏整个纺织工业中，工人的平均年龄是四十五岁，颇有后继无人之忧。
    当谈到和中国进行贸易时，不论是工人或者资本家，都表示了很大兴趣。他们关心这样一些问题：“中国工业发展了，还要不要我们的纺织品？”“中国有哪些物品可以同我们交换？”有一次，我们同纺织业资本家锡尔凡闲谈的时候，提到中日的贸易正在逐步恢复。他很感慨地说：“从经济上看，这对我们说来实在可怕！”
    被煤烟熏得污黑的曼彻斯特的古老建筑，散布在它四周的已经停止冒烟的烟囱，忧心忡忡的老年工人，……交织成一幅英国纺织工业没落的图画。这个工业曾经被称为“英国产业革命的起点”；现在，它似乎快要走到它历史的终点了。（附图片）
