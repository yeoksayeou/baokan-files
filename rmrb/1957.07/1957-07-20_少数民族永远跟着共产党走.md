Minority Nationalities Will Forever Follow the Communist Party
Wang Guishen, Yi Nationality Student, Department of History, Renmin University of China

I am the son of a poor peasant from a minority nationality in the high and cold mountainous areas of Guizhou Province. I want to lodge a serious protest and accusation against the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou.

Everyone knows that the likes of Ge Peiqi are frantically attacking our Party, stubbornly claiming that ninety percent of the Chinese Communist Party members are engaged in nothing but "evil." Is this the truth? We must answer: "This is nonsense!" Everyone knows that before liberation, our minority nationalities lived as if in the eighteenth level of hell. The Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a Great Han chauvinist policy, cruelly oppressing and exploiting us, even using airplanes and artillery to massacre our Liangshan Yi people in 1947. These bloody facts cannot be fully recounted in days and nights. The Communist Party came, and our minority nationalities were reborn. Hundreds of thousands of slaves in the Liangshan area were liberated. Is this the Communist Party doing "evil"?

Before liberation, the reactionaries adopted the policy of "using the barbarians to control the barbarians" and provoked relations between various ethnic groups, causing us to be enemies for generations. We distrusted the Han people and had deep divisions. But the Communist Party told us to unite, allowing us to enjoy national equality and freedom, and helping us establish national regional autonomy. Our minority nationalities have their own governors, prefects, and county heads, and their own cadres, truly becoming masters of our own affairs and jointly building the great motherland family with our Han brothers. Is this also the Communist Party doing "evil"?

Before liberation, who cared about the construction of our minority nationality areas? The Communist Party came, and construction began in our areas. Many minority nationality areas saw their own factories for the first time, and had their own workers. Minority nationality farmers also actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, joining agricultural production cooperatives village by village and township by township, increasing their incomes. For example, in our Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou, grain production in 1956 increased by 59% compared to 1950, and more than 80% of cooperative members increased their income. Minority nationality farmers said, "The Communist Party is too good. Land reform allowed us to turn over once, and cooperativization allowed us to turn over a second time." "Even if you beat us with sticks and pinch us with fire tongs, you can't drive us out of the cooperative." The Kangzang Plateau, which was always closed to traffic, has now been connected by highways and opened air routes. Many minority nationality areas with extremely backward economies and cultures have seen the emergence of new towns, schools, hospitals, and shops; the Party is helping more than ten million minority nationalities without written languages to create their own writing systems. Why do the likes of Ge Peiqi insist on saying that these countless good deeds are the Communist Party doing "evil"? Of course, these good things are indeed not good for our enemies, but their attempts will not succeed, just as their eyes can never see their own ears.

The likes of Ge Peiqi also say that people's lives have not improved. Is this also the truth? We say: "This is lying with your eyes open." Let the facts shatter their reactionary rhetoric: No one will forget the life of beasts of burden before liberation. In those difficult years, did only one or two families not have enough to eat and wear, and eat ferns, tubers, bran, wild fruits, and wild vegetables? What happened after liberation? If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, our family would have frozen and starved to death long ago, let alone have me attend university! My younger sister is also about to graduate from elementary school, and my family is no longer hungry. Let me talk about another fact: In the original Lushan Miao Autonomous County of Guizhou Province, the purchasing power per person was only 17.2 yuan in 1951, but it rose to 25.3 yuan in 1955. During the same period, the purchase of cloth in the Weining Yi, Miao, and Hui Autonomous County doubled. You should know that before liberation, it was in these places that eighteen-year-old girls had no pants to wear, but this situation is now a thing of the past. Before liberation, there was such a folk song circulating in this area: "Suofulong Street, buckwheat and potatoes are the daily life, if you want to eat a meal of corn rice, you have to wait for your wife to have a child, if you want to eat a meal of rice, you have to wait until the next life," but about the life after liberation they say: "A short person climbing the stairs rises step by step."

The likes of Ge Peiqi also say that the relationship between the Communist Party and the people is a hundred and eight thousand miles apart from what it was before liberation. This is of course also nonsense. What is a hundred and eight thousand miles away from the people is imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, not the Chinese Communist Party. What is a hundred and eight thousand miles away from the Communist Party is also only the likes of Ge Peiqi, definitely not the Chinese people. Everyone knows the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. For example, hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members climb mountains and cross ridges to work in the Kangzang Plateau and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, "settling down" in minority nationality areas, sharing weal and woe with minority nationalities, and faithfully implementing the Party's national policies. Over the years, they have done many good things for minority nationalities, and are supported and loved by the minority nationality masses, who call them "new Han people sent by Chairman Mao." Can these ironclad facts say that the relationship between the Communist Party and the people is a hundred and eight thousand miles apart from what it was before liberation? You should know that the relationship between our minority nationalities and the Communist Party is inseparable, indispensable, and unbreakable.

Enough, no more examples. Let these gentlemen who are good at distorting black and white go to the countryside to see! Go to the border minority nationality areas to see! Please listen carefully to the voices of the minority nationalities: "Chairman Mao is the sun in winter and the rain in summer, the great savior of all ethnic groups," "Listening to Chairman Mao's words and taking the socialist road is the bright road"!

We minority nationalities, like the people of the whole country, understand: China cannot do without the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no liberation today, and without the Communist Party, there would be no happiness tomorrow. When drinking water, don't forget the well digger; minority nationalities don't forget the Communist Party. Mr. Ge and his like may not want the Communist Party; but I want to tell them that I want the Communist Party, our three million Yi people want it, the thirty-five million minority nationalities want it, and the six hundred million Chinese people want it. We minority nationality people will, together with the people of the whole country, follow the Communist Party for generations, because we know from our own personal experience that only the Communist Party is our savior, and only socialism is our lifeline. Whoever dares to tell us to leave the Communist Party and socialism, we minority nationality people will pick up our hoes and sickles, and together with the people of the whole country, give these shameless people a double blow, and smash their heads!

Some people oppose us shouting "Long live!" but I want to shout, and the people of the whole country want to shout:

Long live the unbreakable unity of all nationalities!
Long live our great socialist motherland!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party that guides us from victory to victory!
Long live our dear leader, the great savior of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao!

### 少数民族永远跟着共产党走

    少数民族永远跟着共产党走
    中国人民大学历史系彝族学生  王桂森
    我是贵州省高寒山区一个少数民族贫农的儿子。我要向反党反社会主义的葛佩琦、王德周之流提出严重抗议和控诉。
    大家知道，葛佩琦之流正在猖狂地向我们党进攻，他们硬说，中国共产党党员百分之九十无“恶”不作，难道这是事实吗？我们要回答：“这是胡说八道”。谁都知道，解放前我们少数民族人民就像在十八层地狱里生活，国民党反动派实行大汉族主义政策，残酷地压迫我们，剥削我们，甚至在1947年用飞机大炮屠杀我们凉山彝族。这些血淋淋的事实，几天几夜也说不完。共产党来了，我们少数民族才重见天日，凉山地区成千上万的奴隶得到了解放，难道这是共产党作“恶”吗？
    解放前，反动派采取“以夷治夷”的政策，并挑拨各民族间的关系，使我们人民内部世世代代打冤家，我们对汉族人民不信任，隔阂很深。但是共产党却叫我们团结起来了，使我们享受了民族平等和自由，并帮助我们建立了民族区域自治，我们少数民族有了自己的省长、州长、县长，有了自己的干部，真正的当了家作了主人，和汉族老大哥一道共同建设祖国大家庭。难道这也是共产党作“恶”吗？
    解放前，有谁关心我们少数民族地区的建设呢？共产党来了，我们地区才开始了建设，许多少数民族地区第一次出现了自己的工厂，有了自己的工人。少数民族农民也积极响应了毛主席的号召，整村整乡地加入了农业生产合作社，增加了收入，例如我们贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州，粮食产量1956年比1950年增长59％，有80％以上的社员增加了收入，少数民族农民说：“共产党太好了，土改叫我们翻第一次身，合作化又叫我们翻第二次身”。“棒棒打，火钳夹，也不能把我们撵出合作社”。从来交通闭塞的康藏高原，已经修通了公路，开辟了航空线。经济文化极其落后的许多少数民族地区出现了新的城镇、学校、医院和商店；一千多万没有文字的少数民族，党正在帮助他们创造文字。这些数不清的好事，葛佩琦之流为什么偏偏要说成是共产党作“恶”呢？当然这些好事对于我们的敌人说来确实是不好的，但是他们的任何企图都不能达到，就像他的眼睛永远看不到自己的耳朵一样。
    葛佩琦之流还说，人民的生活没有提高，难道这也是事实吗？我们说：“这是睁着眼睛说瞎话”，让事实来粉碎他们的反动言论吧：解放前牛马般的生活是谁也不会忘记的，在那些苦难的年代里，许多人吃不饱穿不暖，吃过蕨芭、?芝、糠壳、野果、野菜的难道只是一家一户吗？解放后怎么样了呢？要没有共产党领导，我们一家人早就冻死饿死了，还谈得上什么上大学！我的妹妹现在也快小学毕业，家里再也不饿肚子了。我再谈一件事实：贵州省原炉山苗族自治县购买力1951年每人只有17.2元，而到1955年就上升到25.3元。同一时期，威宁彝族苗族回族自治县购布增加一倍，要知道，解放前十八岁大姑娘没裤子穿的就是这些地方，然而这种情况已经一去不复返了。解放前这一带地方流传着这样一首民谣：“索甫龙街子，荞麦洋芋当日子，要想吃顿苞合饭，要等老婆生孩子，要想吃顿大米饭，除非等到二辈子”，而对解放后的生活他们这样说：“矮子爬楼梯步步升高”。
    葛佩琦之流还说，共产党和人民的关系比解放前相差十万八千里。这当然也是胡说，和人民相隔十万八千里的是帝国主义和蒋介石，而不是中国共产党。和共产党相距十万八千里的也只是葛佩琦之流，决不是中国人民。中国共产党和中国人民的血肉关系是任何人都知道的，例如成千上万的共产党员，爬山越岭工作在康藏高原和云贵高原，在少数民族地区“安家落户”，与少数民族同呼吸共甘苦，忠心耿耿地执行党的民族政策，几年来他们为少数民族作了许许多多的好事，受到少数民族群众的拥护和爱戴，称他们为“毛主席派来的新汉人”，难道这些铁的事实能说共产党和人民的关系比解放前相差十万八千里吗？要知道，我们少数民族和共产党的关系是分不开的，离不得的，拆不散的。
    够了，不再举例了，让这些善于颠倒黑白的先生们到农村去看看吧！到边疆少数民族地区去看看吧，请他们竖起耳朵听听少数民族的声音：“毛主席是冬天的太阳夏天的雨，是各族人民的大救星”，“听毛主席的话，走社会主义的路，才是光明大道”！
    我们少数民族和全国人民一样懂得：中国不能没有共产党，没有共产党就没有今天的解放，没有共产党也就没有明天的幸福。喝水不忘挖井人，少数民族不忘共产党。葛先生之流可以不要共产党；但我要告诉他们，我要共产党，我们三百多万彝族人民要，三千五百万少数民族要，六亿中国人民要。我们少数民族人民将和全国人民一道世世代代跟着共产党走，因为我们从自己的切身经历中知道，只有共产党才是我们的救星，只有社会主义才是我们的命根子，谁胆敢叫我们离开共产党和社会主义，我们少数民族人民就要拿起锄头和镰刀，同全国人民一道，给这些无耻之徒以双倍打击，叫他们头破血流！
    有人反对我们喊万岁，但我要喊，全国人民要喊：
    各民族牢不可破的大团结万岁！
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！
    引导我们从胜利走向胜利的中国共产党万岁！
    我们亲爱的领袖、各族人民的伟大救星毛主席万岁！
