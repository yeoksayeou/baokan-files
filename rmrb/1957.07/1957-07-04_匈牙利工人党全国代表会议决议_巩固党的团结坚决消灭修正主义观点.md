Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 2nd: The resolution of the National Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party stated that the basic task of the party organization is to consolidate party unity ideologically and organizationally. In the party's theoretical and political activities, one of the current basic tasks is to eliminate the revisionist views that have widely grown in the past few years and the resulting compromises and remnants of class betrayal, while at the same time resolutely fighting against the revival of dogmatism and sectarianism.

The resolution stated that the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government was a historical necessity. It led the people to victory in repelling the attacks of counter-revolutionary forces, protected the people's power, and rebuilt the country's order and economic life.

The National Congress believes that the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government's request for armed assistance from the Soviet government based on the Warsaw Treaty was to defend the freedom of the Hungarian people, to defend socialism and peace. The Soviet Union, as a true friend of the Hungarian people, gave Hungary the necessary assistance and fulfilled its proletarian internationalist obligations.

The resolution pointed out that the political, moral, and material assistance given to Hungary by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries is one of the indispensable conditions for the Hungarian revolutionary forces to achieve victory in the political struggle, and is a guarantee for Hungary to get rid of inflation and restore and develop the national economy.

**Affirming that the Commanders of the Counter-revolution are the Western Imperialist Groups**

The resolution believes that Hungarian communists should rely on and safeguard the great achievements of the past twelve years, correct the serious mistakes made by the past leadership, suppress and annihilate the remnants of counter-revolution, and eliminate the ideological confusion caused by counter-revolutionaries, especially revisionists.

The resolution stated that the main funders and commanders of the Hungarian counter-revolution were the Western imperialist groups, and the Nagy-Losonczy betrayal group played a particularly large role in the formation of the counter-revolutionary groups and the counter-revolutionary offensive, especially in paralyzing the strength of the party.

The resolution analyzed the performance of various social classes in the counter-revolutionary events of last year, and then said that although the struggle against counter-revolution has achieved a decisive victory, the struggle is far from over. The resolution emphasized that the party, the working class, and all those who support the people's power must be vigilant against hostile elements and take resolute action.

The resolution stated that although the Socialist Workers' Party has some basically new characteristics in its activities, it is not a new political party, but a Marxist-Leninist party re-organized by the working class; it absorbed the most steadfast and sacrificing party members of the former Working People's Party.

The National Congress negated those resolutions made by the first Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party before November 4th of last year that violated Marxism-Leninism, and believed that only after the party's Provisional Central Committee abandoned the Nagy-Losonczy group that betrayed the class, did the party leadership implement the revolutionary theory and policy of the working class. The resolution believes that the Party Central Committee's rejection of the suggestion made by the Yugoslav leaders to turn the workers' committees into political leadership organizations was correct.

The resolution pointed out that the reorganization of the party's work has ended victoriously. The Socialist Workers' Party currently has 345,733 members (40.2% of the number of members of the former Working People's Party). 85.2% of the members are former members of the Working People's Party. There are a total of 12,985 party grassroots organizations. The meeting decided to strengthen party education and suggested that Marxism-Leninism be made a compulsory course in universities and colleges.

**The Party Central Committee's Rejection of the Reactionary Demand for a Multi-party System is Correct**

The resolution criticized those who claimed that the leading force of the present era is not the proletariat but the intellectuals, and believed that the Party Central Committee's rejection of the reactionary demand for a multi-party system in the specific circumstances of Hungary was correct. The resolution stated that in the future, special attention should be paid to preventing speculators, hostile elements, and saboteurs from entering the party, and party members who do not agree with the party's basic principles and political line should not be tolerated to remain in the party. The resolution emphasized the principle of democratic centralism, believing that in addition to fully respecting the rights of party members, party discipline should be strengthened, and unified action in accordance with the resolution should be strictly required. The resolution demanded that the Party Central Committee, on the basis of maintaining party unity, take the strictest measures in the most serious circumstances, and would rather dissolve some party organizations that run counter to the party's policies than allow the situation of enemies and wavering elements undermining party unity from within to recur.

The meeting approved the Party Central Committee's initiative to establish the Communist Youth League, and believed that the Youth League should develop into the most important mass organization other than the trade union in a relatively short period of time.

The resolution pointed out that the Patriotic People's Front is an important area for developing the party's ties with the masses. At present, the enthusiasm of the Patriotic People's Front has not been fully exerted, and all those who are willing to participate in socialist construction should be united to work more broadly in the Patriotic People's Front.

**State Organs Should Continue to Suppress Counter-revolution**

Regarding the issue of continuing to strengthen state power, the resolution stated that the reorganization of state power and administrative organs, the army, border guards, and police has been basically completed. State organs should continue to suppress counter-revolution and must not give freedom to the enemy; otherwise, the democratic freedoms of the broad masses of the people cannot be guaranteed.

When discussing economic policies, the resolution stated that the policy of socialist industrialization should continue to be implemented. The development of heavy industry should be based on the needs and possibilities of the country, and those industrial sectors that are most suitable for domestic conditions should be developed. At present, only a small part of agriculture is socialist in nature, so the central issue in the future is the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The resolution believes that the proper use of small industrial and commercial private capital can supplement the shortcomings of socialist industry and commerce. The party supports law-abiding small industrialists and businessmen who fulfill their tax obligations, but resolutely opposes speculative activities.

The resolution pointed out that this year's national economic plan should be completed, especially by improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and practicing strict economy to overcome the serious difficulties that still exist in economic development.

The party believes that various social organizations must take responsibility for the production plan. The factory party committees and party organizations not only have the right but also the obligation to ask about production and supervise production, but they cannot interfere in the daily work of economic organizations and economic leadership.

The resolution pointed out that the workers' committees are still in a period of experimentation in Hungary, and the issue of its activities still needs to be carefully studied.

**A Struggle Should be Launched Against Petty-Bourgeois Counter-Revolutionary Views in the Ideological Field**

When talking about the tasks in cultural work, the meeting decided that under the leadership of the party, relying on loyal intellectuals, a resolute counterattack should be launched against counter-revolutionary activities in cultural life, and counter-revolutionary elements should be cleared from important positions in cultural life.

The resolution stated that a struggle should be launched against petty-bourgeois counter-revolutionary views and ideological confusion in the ideological field to promote the development of literature and art in the direction of socialist realism.

When talking about international relations, the resolution stated that the party's international relations are based on the principle of proletarian internationalism. Since October of last year, the party's relations with fraternal parties in various countries have been expanding and strengthening based on the principles of equality and mutual respect.

The resolution stated that the events of October last year showed that whether or not one is loyal to the idea of proletarian internationalism and the unity of the socialist camp is not only related to the party, but also to the survival of the country and the people.

The resolution also mentioned that the fraternal parties in Western countries also opposed imperialist provocations and gave support to the Hungarian people in difficult days.

    匈牙利工人党全国代表会议决议
    巩固党的团结坚决消灭修正主义观点
    据新华社布达佩斯2日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党全国代表会议的决议说，党组织的基本任务是在思想上和组织上巩固党的团结。在党的理论和政治活动中，当前基本任务之一是消灭过去几年内广泛滋长的修正主义观点和由此产生的妥协和背叛阶级的残余，同时向教条主义和宗派主义的复活进行坚决斗争。
    决议说，匈牙利工农革命政府的成立具有历史的必要性。它领导人民取得了打退反革命势力进攻的胜利，保护了人民政权，重建了国家的秩序和经济生活。
    全国代表会议认为，工农革命政府根据华沙条约向苏联政府要求武装援助是为了保卫匈牙利人民的自由，保卫社会主义和和平。苏联作为匈牙利人民真正的朋友，给了匈牙利必要的援助，完成了无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    决议指出，苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其他国家给予匈牙利的政治上、道义上和物质上的援助，是匈牙利的革命力量取得政治斗争胜利的必不可少的条件之一，是使匈牙利摆脱通货膨胀、恢复和发展国民经济的保证。
    肯定反革命的指挥者是西方帝国主义集团
    决议认为，匈牙利共产党人今后要依靠和维护过去十二年来的巨大成就，纠正过去的领导所犯的严重错误，镇压和歼灭反革命残余，消除由反革命特别是修正主义者所引起的思想混乱。
    决议说，匈牙利反革命的主要资助者和指挥者是西方帝国主义集团，而在反革命集团的形成和反革命的进攻中，尤其是在瘫痪党的力量上，纳吉—洛松齐背叛集团起了特别大的作用。
    决议分析了各个社会阶层在去年反革命事件中的表现，接着说，虽然对反革命的斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是斗争却远没有结束。决议强调指出，党、工人阶级以及一切拥护人民政权的人都必须对敌对分子提高警惕和采取坚决行动。
    决议说，社会主义工人党虽然在它的活动中具有一些基本上是新的特点，但是它并不是一个新的政党，而是工人阶级重新组织起来的马克思列宁主义政党；它吸收了前劳动人民党的最坚定、最有牺牲精神的党员。
    全国代表会议否定了社会主义工人党第一个执行委员会在去年11月4日以前所作的那些违背马克思列宁主义的决议，并且认为，在党的临时中央委员会摈弃了背叛阶级的纳吉—洛松齐集团以后，党的领导才贯彻了工人阶级的革命理论和政策。决议认为，党中央拒绝了南斯拉夫领导人员所提出的把工人委员会变成政治领导机构的建议，是正确的。
    决议指出，重新组织党的工作已经胜利结束。社会主义工人党目前有党员三十四万五千七百三十三人（为过去劳动人民党党员人数的40.2％。党员中有85.2％是前劳动人民党党员。党的基层组织共有一万二千九百八十五个。会议决定加强党内教育，同时建议在大专学校中把马克思列宁主义订为必修课。
    党中央拒绝了实行多党制的反动要求是正确的
    决议批判了那些主张现时代的领导力量不是无产阶级而是知识分子的说法，并且认为党中央拒绝了在匈牙利具体情况下实行多党制的反动要求，是正确的。决议说，今后应当特别注意不使投机分子、敌对分子和破坏分子进入党内，也不能容忍不同意党的基本原则和政治路线的党员留在党内。决议强调了民主集中制的原则，认为除了完全尊重党员的权利以外，还要加强党的纪律，严格要求符合决议的统一行动。决议要求党中央在维护党的团结的基础上，在最严重的情况下，采取最严格的措施，宁可解散一些同党的政策背道而驰的党组织，也不能让敌人和动摇分子从内部破坏党的团结的情况重演。
    会议批准了党中央关于成立共产主义青年团的倡议，并且认为共青团应该在较短时期内发展成为除工会以外的最重要的群众组织。
    决议指出，爱国人民阵线是发展党同群众联系的重要领域。目前爱国人民阵线的积极性还没有充分发挥，要在爱国人民阵线中更广泛地团结一切愿意参加社会主义建设的人来工作。
    国家机构应继续镇压反革命
    关于继续加强国家政权的问题，决议说，国家政权和行政机构、军队、边防军和警察的改组已经基本上完成。国家机构应该继续镇压反革命，不能给予敌人以自由，否则广大人民的民主自由的权利就无法保证。
    决议在谈到经济政策的问题时说，应该继续贯彻社会主义工业化的政策。重工业的发展要根据国家的需要和可能，要发展那些同国内条件最适合的工业部门。目前，农业只有很少一部分是社会主义性质的，因此今后的中心问题是农业的社会主义改造。
    决议认为，对小工商业私人资本的适当利用能补充社会主义工商业的不足。党支持守法的、完成纳税义务的小工商业者，但是坚决反对投机活动。
    决议指出，应当完成今年的国民经济计划，特别是要通过提高劳动生产率，降低成本，厉行节约等来克服经济发展中还存在的严重困难。
    党认为，各个社会组织必须对生产计划负起自己的责任。工厂党委和党组织不但有权利而且有义务过问生产、监督生产，但是不能干涉经济组织和经济领导的日常工作。
    决议指出，工人委员会在匈牙利还处在试验时期，它的活动问题还需要仔细研究。
    应对思想领域中的小资产阶级反革命观点展开斗争
    谈到文化工作方面的任务时，会议决定要在党的领导下，依靠忠实的知识分子，向文化生活中的反革命活动进行坚决的反击，从文化生活的重要岗位中清除反革命分子。
    决议说，应当对思想领域中的小资产阶级反革命观点和思想混乱展开斗争，促使文学艺术向社会主义现实主义的方向发展。
    决议在谈到国际关系时说，党的国际关系以无产阶级国际主义原则为基础。去年10月以来，党同各国兄弟党的关系正在根据平等和互相尊重的原则扩大和加强。
    决议说，去年10月事件说明，是否忠于无产阶级国际主义思想和社会主义阵营的团结，不仅关系到党，而且也关系到国家和人民的存亡问题。
    决议还谈到，西方国家的兄弟党也反对帝国主义的挑衅，在困难的日子里对匈牙利人民给予了支持。
