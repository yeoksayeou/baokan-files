Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 23rd. While Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy delivered vehement speeches in the United States against communism and neutrality, and greatly praised the United States, political figures in Karachi are indignant and dissatisfied with the US attitude towards Pakistan.

Political figures in Karachi originally had high hopes for Suhrawardy's visit to the United States, believing that the visit would enable the United States to provide Pakistan with more assistance and support Pakistan on the Kashmir and other issues. These individuals also hoped that the Pakistani Minister of Food's trip to the United States would achieve a satisfactory resolution to Pakistan's food shortage problem.

However, Foreign Minister Malik Noon complained at a press conference held in Karachi on July 20 that Pakistan received less aid than India, and that the Kashmir issue could not be submitted to the United Nations Security Council as soon as possible because the United States and the United Kingdom did not approve of doing so.

Finance Minister Amjad Ali said at the same press conference that the United States had only promised to supply Pakistan with 800,000 tons of wheat and rice this year. He said that Pakistan's plan to establish grain reserves would be seriously affected due to the failure to reach a long-term grain agreement with the United States.

The "Jang" (Battle) newspaper said in an editorial on July 22 that the information revealed by the Finance Minister and the Foreign Minister "shows that the United States has adopted an unsatisfactory attitude towards Pakistan." These situations "are distressing and regrettable." "Jang" said that the United States and Pakistan had concluded a series of agreements, and Pakistan had not violated these agreements at all, and supported these agreements. However, the result of Pakistan's great sacrifices was receiving less assistance from the United States.

    苏拉瓦底媚美得不偿失
    巴基斯坦政界不满美国政策
    据新华社卡拉奇23日电　当巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底在美国发表反对共产主义和中立的激烈的演说，并且大大称赞美国的时候，卡拉奇政界人士对于美国对待巴基斯坦的态度感到恼怒和不满。
    卡拉奇政界人士对苏拉瓦底访问美国本来抱着很高的希望，以为这次访问会使美国给巴基斯坦更多的援助，并且在克什米尔和其他问题上支持巴基斯坦。这些人士还盼望巴基斯坦的粮食部长去美国会在解决巴基斯坦粮荒问题上取得圆满的解决。
    但是，外交部长马利克·努恩7月20日在卡拉奇举行的记者招待会上埋怨说，巴基斯坦得到的援助比印度少，而且克什米尔问题也不能够尽早提交联合国安全理事会，因为美国和英国不赞成这样做。
    财政部长阿姆贾德·阿里在同一次记者招待会上说，美国只答应今年供给巴基斯坦八十万吨小麦和大米。他说，由于没有同美国达成长期粮食协定，巴基斯坦建立粮食储备的计划将受严重的影响。
    “战斗报”7月22日在一篇社论中说，财政部长和外交部长所透露出来的情况“表明美国对巴基斯坦采取了不能令人满意的态度”。这些情况“令人感到痛心和遗憾”。“战斗报”说，美国和巴基斯坦缔结了一连串的协定，巴基斯坦一点没有破坏这些协定，而且支持这些协定。可是巴基斯坦作了巨大的牺牲的结果却是从美国得到较少的援助。
