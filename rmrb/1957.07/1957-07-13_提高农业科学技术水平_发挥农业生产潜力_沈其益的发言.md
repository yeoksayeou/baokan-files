Improve the Level of Agricultural Science and Technology, Unleash the Potential of Agricultural Production
Shen Qiyi's Speech
    Due attention should be paid to the problem of preventing waterlogging - Vigorously increase the production of chemical fertilizers to meet the needs of agricultural production increase - Pests and diseases cause great losses to agricultural products, and pest control work should be regularized - Five suggestions for improving seed work - Fully utilize the abundant grasslands in the Northwest and other places to develop animal husbandry production - Carry out agricultural scientific research to promote agricultural production - The training of agricultural cadres must adapt to national needs and implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo's reports on the national budget final accounts and national economic plan, and other reports of the conference.

    Since the founding of the country, China's agricultural socialist transformation and agricultural production have been developing rapidly. Thanks to the basic completion of the great agricultural socialist transformation in 1956, the country's farmers, under this superior socialist system, overcame natural disasters, making the production of grain, soybeans, pigs, etc., exceed the bumper year of 1955. The total output value of agricultural and sideline industries in 1956 was close to completing the Five-Year Plan, an increase of 79 percent, or 25.7 billion yuan, compared with 1949. The purchasing power and living standards of farmers have improved a lot. This is another glorious victory on China's agricultural production front.

    The acquisition of this huge achievement fully demonstrates the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, which has inspired and mobilized the production enthusiasm of 500 million farmers. Secondly, many large-scale production-increasing measures were carried out in 1956, which had a great effect. For example, the irrigated area was increased by 120 million mu, the planting area of rice was expanded by 55 million mu, the area of high-yield crops was expanded by 57 million mu, and fertilizer application, pest and disease control, and the promotion of improved varieties and agricultural tools were increased. Thirdly, the state has given farmers great economic and technical support, such as providing agricultural loans of 3.34 billion yuan, agricultural product advance purchase deposits of 1.2 billion yuan, as well as a lot of material and scientific and technological support. These are important factors in developing agricultural production. These tremendous achievements have shattered the absurd remarks of rightist elements who said that "agricultural cooperatives have no superiority," "farmers' lives have not improved," and "the first Five-Year Plan was messed up."

    However, there are still some shortcomings and problems in the work of our agricultural departments. The potential of agricultural production has not been fully exploited, and agricultural science and technology are still lagging behind the needs of production. As an agricultural scientist, I would like to put forward a few opinions on agricultural issues:

    (1) Prevent waterlogging and increase chemical fertilizers. Water and fertilizer are two key issues in agricultural production. Since liberation, the Party and the government have attached great importance to water conservancy, especially in the great achievements in harnessing the Huaihe, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers, building dikes for flood control, and digging wells for irrigation. These are unprecedented in any era in Chinese history. It has guaranteed the great victory of the country's farmers in the struggle against waterlogging and drought. However, in terms of preventing waterlogging, we feel that we have not paid enough attention to it, and it still seriously threatens our agricultural production. For example, the Wusi Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, which I inspected last year, suffered a disaster area of about 2,500 mu. Another example is the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative, where 12,000 mu out of 17,000 mu of land were affected by the disaster. According to the Ministry of Water Resources, the total average annual flooded area in the past seven years is still 70 million mu, with 40 million mu affected by disasters. Among them, waterlogging accounts for 70 percent and mountain floods account for 30 percent. This is an urgent problem, and we hope to find a solution soon. Secondly, applying more fertilizer is most effective for increasing production. China's long-term agricultural production has depleted soil fertility a lot. Most areas generally lack fertilizer, becoming so-called low-yield areas. Especially in recent years, the increase in multiple cropping index, the planting of more high-yield crops, and the use of cake fertilizer for raising pigs have made the fertilizer shortage more prominent. We believe that in addition to the government's call for farmers to work hard to increase natural farm fertilizers and plant more green manure, we must vigorously increase the production of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizer. I fully support Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report that we should pay special attention to the development of the chemical fertilizer industry in the future. It is estimated that every ton of chemical fertilizer applied can increase grain production by 3 to 5 tons. If we increase chemical fertilizer by 5 million tons per year, we can increase grain production by 30 to 50 billion catties. Moreover, farmers are willing to save a lot of funds to purchase chemical fertilizers in order to expand reproduction. We hope that we can increase investment in this area and set up factories to manufacture them as soon as possible.

    (2) Pest and disease control. In the past few years, agricultural departments have done a lot of work in pest and disease control, such as promoting a large number of medicines and machinery, organizing mass pest and disease control work, carrying out pest and disease forecasting and quarantine work, and basically controlling locust plagues, rice borer disasters, etc., which have played a great role in ensuring the production of crops. However, at present, pest and disease disasters are still threatening China's agricultural production. It is estimated that agricultural products suffer losses from pests and diseases, with grain accounting for about 10 percent, cotton accounting for about 20 to 30 percent, and fruits accounting for about 40 percent. This is a huge number that must be gradually eliminated. However, there are still some problems in pest and disease control. First of all, leaders at all levels have not regarded pest and disease control as a regular task, and are often forced to fight and rush to control pests only when pests and diseases occur on a large scale. Therefore, the work is passive, consuming a lot of manpower, medicines, and machinery, and suffering great losses. Taking locust control as an example, locusts were extremely serious in the early days of liberation. After several years of struggle, the locust plague was wiped out. After the locust plague was reduced, Shandong and Hebei provinces successively abolished the locust control stations in 1953 and 1954. Therefore, it was impossible to grasp the locust occurrence situation. As a result, this spring and summer, locust plagues occurred again in the vast areas of seven counties at the junction of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces, and locust control work was very passive. It was only after mobilizing a large amount of manpower and material resources and mobilizing aircraft support that it was controlled. This is a serious lesson. Another example is that cotton aphids were treated a little late this year, which will also affect production. We believe that pest and disease control should be a regular task. The central government, provinces, prefectures, and counties should have fixed institutions and personnel to master this work, strengthen forecasting and forecasting, prevent and control in a timely manner, and constantly improve the technical level of prevention and control work. Secondly, in pest and disease control, plant quarantine work has been neglected. Therefore, some dangerous pests and diseases are often transmitted to some areas that were originally free of pests and diseases due to the transfer of seeds and seedlings. This is extremely dangerous. For example, Guangxi originally had no bean weevils, but this year they were transmitted from Hubei to Guilin and Pingle. Fujian originally had no mulberry scale, but they were also transmitted from Zhejiang. These are being eliminated. We believe that quarantine regulations should be formulated in the future, internal and external quarantine work should be strengthened, and the spread of dangerous pests and diseases should be strictly controlled.

    (3) Promote improved varieties. Breeding and promoting improved varieties is an important production increase measure. In the past few years, thanks to the efforts of agricultural departments, a number of excellent varieties such as Bima No. 1 and Nant No. have been promoted, which have produced significant results in increasing production. However, the work of breeding improved varieties has not yet established a sound system and cannot meet the needs of agricultural production. Moreover, in individual areas, some losses have also been suffered due to blind promotion without conducting regional adaptability tests of varieties. In order to improve seed work, the following suggestions are put forward for reference: (1) Strengthen guidance on the selection and retention of seeds by cooperatives, so that cooperatives can gradually establish their own seed retention land and select and reproduce the improved seeds they need. (2) Stipulate the task of breeding improved varieties for state-owned farms and qualified cooperatives, and establish improved variety bases in appropriate areas. (3) Strengthen the regional adaptability test of improved varieties to determine the promotion area of improved varieties. (4) Strengthen the breeding of new varieties and the reproduction of original seeds in experimental research institutions and universities. (5) Establish institutions to manage improved varieties, be responsible for the management and dispatch of improved varieties, and appropriately increase the price of improved varieties to ensure the quality of improved varieties. We hope that relevant parties can improve these tasks to meet the needs of agricultural development.

    (4) Develop animal husbandry. With the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for meat, wool, leather, and milk products is constantly increasing. This year, in order to take care of the needs of the domestic market, the export of meat was reduced by 85,000 tons, which is a loss to China's industrial construction. In the future, in order to improve people's lives and industrial construction, we should accelerate the development of animal husbandry. In addition to continuing to develop pig raising in agricultural areas, it is recommended to put more effort into developing animal husbandry in China's vast pastoral areas and to make full use of the rich grasslands of more than one billion mu in Northwest China, Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and other places. It is estimated that there are 14 million hectares of grassland in the Hailar area of Inner Mongolia alone, which can raise millions of cattle and sheep, which can be exchanged for millions of tons of steel for the motherland, which is very important for the national economy and people's livelihood. In addition, while developing animal husbandry, we should also pay attention to the breeding of varieties. At present, some state-owned farms do not pay enough attention to the improvement of fine-wool sheep and other livestock breeds, which have long-term benefits. We hope to consider correcting this. In addition, we must strengthen the prevention and control of animal diseases and feeding management.

    (5) Agricultural scientific research. Since liberation, agricultural scientific research has made great progress. In 1956, a long-term plan for scientific research was carried out and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences was established. These major measures will greatly promote agricultural scientific research. Our agricultural scientists fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's statement in the government work report that we should strengthen the coordination of agricultural research work, so that the scientific forces of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, agricultural scientific research institutions, and universities can be fully utilized, and research topics can be shared under a jointly formulated plan. At the same time, in order to develop production in accordance with local conditions, we believe that we should also strengthen the scientific forces of specialized county farms and agricultural technology guidance stations, establish a large number of bases to guide agricultural production, and only when the work of the national agricultural science network is fully carried out can we continuously advance agricultural production.

    (6) Training cadres. In the past few years, agricultural colleges and universities have adhered to the teaching policy of integrating theory with practice, learning from the Soviet Union, and carrying out teaching reform, and have achieved certain results in the quantity and quality of training cadres. For example, in Beijing Agricultural University, where I work, since liberation, it has trained 1,161 university graduates, 65 graduate students, and 1,124 specialized training classes for the country, which is more than the talents trained by this school in the 30 years before liberation. These graduates are assigned to all parts of the country to work in production, teaching, research, and business administration. It is understood that most of them are hard-working, contact the masses of farmers, and are competent for their jobs. They can also adhere to their work and perform well in production positions. This is the result of strengthening political and ideological education in universities, emphasizing the teaching policy of integrating theory with practice, learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform, and the Party's leadership over universities. These achievements must never be erased.

    However, there are still shortcomings and problems in higher agricultural colleges and universities that need to be continuously improved. First of all, it is necessary to further target the caliber of talent training so that the training of professional talents can meet the needs of national construction. We must train agricultural talents with high theoretical knowledge, master production operation technology, and have the ability to organize and lead production, orienting themselves to production and serving farmers. Under the premise of this training goal, we must summarize the experience of learning from the Soviet Union and combining it with China's reality to further improve the quality of teaching. Secondly, we must implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running schools, create conditions, increase library equipment, and set up research rooms, experimental stations, veterinary hospitals, etc. to carry out research work and improve academic standards, so that all teachers in the school can be better organized to use advanced theories and technologies to deeply study and seek solutions to problems in agricultural production. Thirdly, we must strengthen the ideological education of Marxism-Leninism, establish a working-class world view, fight back against rightists, and eliminate all non-proletarian ideas in universities. These can only be achieved by strengthening the Party's leadership and strengthening academic leadership.

    In short, under the leadership of the Party and the government, China's agricultural development is huge, and the improvement and improvement of farmers' lives is significant. However, in order to make agricultural production adapt to the needs of industrial development and rapidly change the backward state of agriculture, we must comprehensively strengthen agricultural work. Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please correct me.

    提高农业科学技术水平  发挥农业生产潜力
    沈其益的发言
    防止内涝问题要给以应有的重视——适应农业增产需要，大力增产化学肥料——病虫害对农产品造成的损失很大，防治虫害工作应当经常化——改进种籽工作的五点意见——充分利用西北等地的丰富草原，发展畜牧生产——开展农业科学研究，推进农业生产——培养农业干部必须适应国家需要，并贯彻勤俭办学方针
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李先念、薄一波副总理关于国家预算决算和国民经济计划的报告，以及大会的其他报告。
    建国以来，我国的农业社会主义改造和农业生产都在飞跃的发展。由于一九五六年基本上完成了伟大的农业社会主义改造，全国农民在这个优越的社会主义制度下，战胜了自然灾害，使粮食、大豆、猪只等的生产都超过了丰收的一九五五年，一九五六年农副业的总产值已接近完成五年计划，比一九四九年增加了百分之七十九，即增加了二百五十七亿元。农民的购买力和生活水平提高了很多。这是我国农业生产战线上又一次辉煌的胜利。
    这一巨大成绩的获得，充分表明了农业生产合作社的优越性，它把五亿农民的生产热情鼓舞和调动起来了。其次是一九五六年进行了许多规模巨大的增产措施，发生了很大的效果。如增加了灌溉面积一亿二千万亩，扩大了水稻种植面积五千五百万亩，扩大高产作物五千七百万亩，和增施肥料、防治病虫害、推广良种和农具等。第三是国家给予了农民很大的经济上和技术上的支持，如给予农贷三十三亿四千万元、农产预购订金十二亿元，以及很多物资上和科学技术上的支援。这些都是发展农业生产的重要因素。这些巨大的成就，击破了右派分子所说“农业合作社没有优越性”、“农民生活没有改善”、“第一个五年计划搞糟了”的荒谬言论。
    但是，我们农业部门的工作，也还存在着一些缺点和问题，农业生产潜力还没有充分发挥起来，农业科学技术还落后于生产的需要。作为一个农业科学工作者，我想对农业方面的问题提出几点意见：
    （一）防止内涝，增产化学肥料。水和肥料是农业生产上两个关键性问题。解放以来，党和政府对水利事业极为重视，特别是在治理淮河、长江、黄河等水系，筑堤防汛，和打井灌溉等方面的巨大成就，是我国历史上任何时代所没有的，它保证了全国农民与水旱作斗争的巨大胜利。但是，在防止内涝方面，我们感到还重视得不够，它还严重地威胁着我们的农业生产。例如我去年视察的北京郊区五四农业社，受灾面积约二千五百亩。又如黄土岗农业社一万七千亩土地就有一万二千亩受了灾。据水利部报告，七年来总计每年平均淹水面积还有七千万亩，成灾四千万亩。其中内涝百分之七十，山洪洪水百分之三十，这是一个迫切问题，希望迅筹解决。其次，增施肥料对增产最有效，我国长期的农业生产，耗损地力很多。广大地区，普遍缺肥，成为所谓低产区。特别是近年来，增加复种指数，多种高产作物，用饼肥养猪，缺肥现象更为突出。我们认为除了政府已号召农民努力增加农家自然肥料和多种绿肥外，必须大力增产化学肥料，特别是氮肥。我完全拥护薄一波副总理报告中指出今后要特别注意发展化学肥料工业的方针。估计每增施一吨化肥，可增产三至五吨粮食。如每年增加五百万吨化肥，就可增加三百至五百亿斤粮食。而且农民为了扩大再生产是乐于节省大量资金购用化肥的。我们希望能够增加这方面的投资，设厂制造早日实现。
    （二）防治病虫。几年来，农业部门在病虫防治工作上做了很多工作，如推广了大量的药械，组织了群众性的病虫防治工作，开展了病虫的预测预报和检疫工作，基本上控制了蝗灾、螟灾等，对保证农作物的生产起了很大的作用。但是，目前病虫灾害，仍然在威胁着我国的农业生产。估计农产品所受病虫损失，粮食约百分之十，棉花约百分之二十至三十，果品约百分之四十。这是一个巨大的数字，必须逐步加以消灭。但是，当前在病虫防治上还存在一些问题。首先是各级领导还没有把病虫防治看做一项经常性的工作，每每是在病虫大发生时才被迫应战，突击治虫。因此工作被动，耗费了极多的人力和药械，还遭受很大的损失。即以治蝗为例，解放初期蝗虫为害极严重，经过几年来的斗争，把蝗灾扑灭下来，在蝗灾减轻以后，山东、河北两省在一九五三年至一九五四年相继把治蝗站撤销，因此，就不能掌握蝗虫发生情况，以至今年春夏在山东、河北、河南三省交界七个县的广大地带，又有蝗灾发生，治虫工作感到非常被动。在动员了极大的人力物力，调动飞机支援，才控制下来。这是一次严重的教训。又如今年棉蚜治得迟了一些，也会影响生产。我们认为防治病虫应作为一项经常性的工作。中央、各省、专区和县都要有固定的机构和人员掌握这项工作，加强预测预报，及时防治，并不断提高防治工作的技术水平。其次，在病虫防治上，还忽视了植物检疫工作，因此一些危险性病虫害，每每因种籽苗木的调动，传染到一些原来无病虫的地带。这是异常危险的。例如广西原无蚕豆象，今年从湖北传到了桂林和平乐，福建原无桑蟥也从浙江传染进来了，这些都在加紧消灭中。我们认为今后应制订检疫法规，加强对内和对外的检疫工作，严格控制危险性病虫的传播。
    （三）推广良种。良种繁育和推广是一项重要增产措施，几年来由于农业部门的努力，推广了不少优良品种如碧玛一号、南特号等，在增产上已经产生了显著的效果。但是良种繁育工作，还没有建立完善的制度，还不能满足农业生产的需要。而且有个别地区由于没有做过品种区域适应性的试验，盲目推广，也遭受了一些损失。为了改进种籽工作，提出以下几点参考意见：（1）加强指导合作社的选种留种工作，使合作社逐步建立自己的留种地，选择和繁殖自己所需用的优良种籽。（2）规定国营农场和有条件的合作社，繁殖优良品种的任务，并在适当地区建立良种基地。（3）加强良种的区域适应性试验，确定良种的推广区域。（4）加强试验研究机关和高等院校的新品种的培育和原种的繁育工作。（5）设立经营管理良种的机构，负责良种的管理和调度，并适当地提高良种的价格，以保证良种的质量。我们希望有关方面能够把这些工作健全起来，以适应农业发展的需要。
    （四）发展畜牧业。由于人民生活水平的提高，对于肉类、毛料、皮革、奶品的需要，正在不断增长。今年为了照顾国内市场的需要，减少了肉类出口八万五千吨，这对于我国工业建设是一个损失。今后为了提高人民生活和工业建设应加速发展畜牧业。除在农区继续发展养猪外，建议以较大力量放在发展我国广大牧区的畜牧业上，把我国西北、东北、内蒙、青海等地的十几亿亩的丰富草原充分利用起来。据估计单在内蒙海拉尔地区就有一千四百万公顷的草原，可以饲养几百万头牛羊，可以为祖国换取几百万吨钢材，对国计民生都是十分重要的。此外在发展畜牧业的同时，还要注意品种的培育，目前有些国营牧场，对于有着长远利益的细毛羊和其他牲畜品种改良工作，还重视得不够，希望考虑改正。此外还要加强兽疫防治和饲养管理工作。
    （五）农业科学研究。解放以来，农业科学研究工作有了较大的发展。一九五六年又进行了科学研究远景的规划和成立了农业科学研究院，这些重大措施，都将对农业科学研究起着巨大的推动作用。我们农业科学工作者完全拥护周恩来总理在政府工作报告中指出的应加强农业研究工作的协调。使中国科学院农业科学研究机关和高等院校的科学力量充分发挥起来，在共同制订的计划下分担研究课题。同时，为了因地制宜，发展生产，我们认为还应加强专县农场和农业技术指导站的科学力量。建立广大的指导农业生产的基点，只有全国农业科学网的工作充分开展起来，才能把农业生产不断推向前进。
    （六）培养干部。几年来，由于高等农业院校，坚持了理论与实际一致的教学方针，学习苏联，进行教学改革，在培养干部的数量和质量上取得了一定的成绩。例如在我所工作的北京农业大学，解放后就为国家输送了大学毕业生一千一百六十一人，研究生六十五人，专修科训练班一千一百二十四人，比解放前这个学校三十年所培养的人才还要多。这些毕业学生都分配在全国各地担任生产、教学、研究和业务行政工作。据了解大多数是克苦耐劳，联系农民群众，能胜任自己的职务的。在生产岗位上也能坚持工作，表现良好。这是高等学校加强了政治思想教育，强调理论与实际一致的教学方针的结果，也是学习苏联进行教学改革的结果，也是党对高等学校领导的结果。这些成绩是绝不容抹煞的。
    但是，在高等农业院校中还存在着缺点和问题，需要不断改进。首先是要进一步对好培养人才的口径，使专业人才的培养能够符合国家建设的需要。我们必需培养具有较高理论知识，掌握生产操作技术，富有组织领导生产才能的农业人才，面向生产，为农民服务。我们要在这个培养目标的前题下，总结学习苏联结合我国实际的经验，进一步提高教学质量。其次是要贯彻勤俭办学的方针，创设条件，增加图书设备，设立研究室、实验站、兽医院等开展研究工作，提高学术水平。使全校教师更好地组织起来，运用先进的理论和技术，深入地研究和寻求解决农业生产中的问题。第三是要加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育，树立工人阶级的世界观，回击右派，清除高等学校中的一切非无产阶级思想。这些都只有加强党的领导，加强学术领导，才能实现的。
    总之，在党和政府的领导下，我国农业的发展是巨大的，农民生活的改进和提高是显著的。但是为了使农业生产能够适应工业发展的需要，迅速改变农业的落后状态，就必须全面地加强农业方面的工作。以上意见，是否恰当，请代表指正。
