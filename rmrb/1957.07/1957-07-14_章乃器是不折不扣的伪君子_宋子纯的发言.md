I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the other reports. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report the achievements, shortcomings, and lessons learned in our country's socialist construction over the past few years, and also pointed out the direction for future progress. He also justly and severely criticized the right-wingers' fallacies against the Party, against the people, and against socialism.

In the past two months, non-Party members responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party to help the Party rectify its work style, helping some Party members overcome bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism. The Communist Party's wise measure was for the sake of building the motherland better, resolutely opening up avenues for speech, gathering wisdom, and absorbing criticisms of Party members from all sides. This is truly a great and unprecedented initiative. However, the right-wingers are not helping the Party to rectify its work style, but using the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work style, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party, undermine the cause of socialist construction, and wanting capitalism to be restored in China. Zhang Naiqi is one of the anti-Party and anti-people right-wing elements, and the vice-chairman of both the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association. His series of absurd remarks confused the thinking of a small number of backward industrialists and businessmen because he spoke as a leader of the two associations and a senior cadre of the state, deceiving the trust of the masses. For example, he said that "fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income." Some industrialists and businessmen then said: Our enterprises have already been jointly owned by public and private interests, can taking a little fixed interest still be considered exploitation? He also said: "There is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements; the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature," and "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism," and so on. After these fallacies of his were issued, because my own political sense was very poor at the time, and my understanding was also vague, it was not until June 18th and 19th, when I participated in the joint meeting held by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association to discuss Zhang Naiqi's fallacies against socialism, that I realized the harmfulness of Zhang Naiqi's absurd remarks. In particular, after we recently re-studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," we once again brightened our eyes, enabling me to distinguish right from wrong, recognize the enemy from ourselves, and recognize the road forward. Zhang Naiqi's despicable behavior of opposing the Party and opposing socialism is shameful and hateful. We must resolutely draw a clear line, and fight the right-wing elements to the end. I could not understand Zhang Naiqi's malicious reactionary remarks and behaviors of blurring class boundaries, beautifying and elevating the bourgeoisie, and opposing the leadership of the working class. After liberation, the Party and the government did not blame him for his past mistakes, and even gave him important tasks. Isn't this the Party's equal treatment of democratic人士? If he had a little conscience, he would do his best to serve the people to redeem his past sins. However, Zhang Naiqi was not like this. On the contrary, he harbored ulterior motives, secretly used his powers to cultivate his political capital, spread anti-socialist remarks in the industrial and commercial circles, and carried out reactionary activities, while on the surface he said: "Protecting the Party is like protecting one's own eyeballs." Is this kind of "protection" protection? I think it is a frame-up rather than protection. What he said and what he did completely prove that he is an out-and-out, hypocritical, and two-faced man.

In addition, some people in the industrial and commercial circles have proposed to abolish the public representatives in the joint public-private enterprises, saying that the private personnel can also run the enterprises well. Others have said: "Fixed interest should be extended for twenty years; seven years of fixed interest is not considered redemption." This fallacy is of the same origin as Zhang Naiqi's and echoes each other. I think we need to clarify a fundamental question here: who is the owner of the factories and enterprises? All the property of factories and enterprises is created by the surplus value of the labor of the working class. Capitalists have exploited workers for many years, and eating the workers' blood and sweat has exceeded the original capital many times. Isn't this exploitation account very obvious? Even if all the property is confiscated, the debt cannot be cleared. However, our country did not take the method of confiscation, but adopted the method of peaceful transformation and redemption, and after the joint public-private ownership, arranged work for the private personnel and adopted the method of contracting them, so that they could all get what they deserved and be transformed into self-reliant workers. It can be said that the capitalists have been treated with benevolence and righteousness. Today, the capitalists have instead proposed "to withdraw the public representatives from the joint public-private enterprises and extend the fixed interest for twenty years." Where is your raised hands in favor of "taking the socialist road and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party" reflected? Therefore, I say that these people are hypocritical, and obey in public but oppose in private. Once there is a loophole, they want to take the capitalist road. The dual nature of the bourgeoisie, especially the reactionary side, is still very serious. Isn't it necessary to continue the transformation? I think ideological transformation is a long-term process, and the Party should continue to transform them. If they are not elements with ulterior motives, they should honestly accept the transformation. This is the only way out. Right-wingers and ambitious people vainly attempt to drag society onto the capitalist road and restore capitalism in China. It can be said with certainty that this road is impassable. We solemnly warn right-wingers like Zhang Naiqi, you have only two paths in front of you: repent and thoroughly confess, and honestly accept transformation, which is a bright road; if you still persist in your reactionary stance and resist transformation, then you will cut yourself off from the people.

Industrial and commercial circles, in this anti-rightist struggle, have received an extremely profound socialist education. Taking the socialist road and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, we are more firm and clear. In the future, we must also seriously transform ourselves into self-reliant workers in practice, manage the public-private cooperation relationship well, run enterprises well, actively serve socialist construction, and work together with the people of the whole country to build our country into a great socialist country.

    章乃器是不折不扣的伪君子
    宋子纯的发言
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他几个报告。周总理在报告中指出了我们国家几年来在社会主义建设中的成绩、缺点和经验教训，也指出了今后前进的方向，并义正词严的批判了右派分子的反党、反人民、反社会主义的谬论。
    近两月来，党外人士响应了中国共产党的号召帮助党整风，帮助某些党员克服作风上的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义；共产党这一英明措施是为了把祖国建设的更好起见，毅然广开言路，集思广益，吸收各方面对党员的批评意见，这真是旷古不闻的伟大创举。但是右派分子不是帮助党来整风，而是以帮助党整风为幌子，企图推翻党的领导，破坏社会主义建设事业，想要资本主义在中国复辟。章乃器就是反党、反人民的右派分子之一。他是全国工商业联合会和民主建国会的副主任委员，他的一系列的荒谬言论，混淆了一小部分落后工商业者的思想。因为他以两会领导人和国家高级干部的身份出来讲话，骗取了群众的信任，如他所谓“定息不是剥削而是不劳而获的收入”。有的工商业者就说：我们的企业已经公私合营了，只拿几个定息还能算剥削吗？又如他说：“资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别，资产阶级没有两面性了”，“官僚主义比资本主义是更加危险的敌人”等等。他的这些谬论发出后，因为当时我自己的政治嗅觉很差，认识也是模糊的。至六月十八、九日参加全国工商联和民建召开的联席会议对于章乃器反对社会主义的谬论作了讨论后，我才认识到章乃器荒谬言论的危害性。特别是我们最近再次学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”的报告后，又一次擦亮了眼睛，使我能够辨明是非，认清敌我，认清前进的道路。章乃器反党、反社会主义的卑鄙行为是可耻的，是令人痛恨的，我们必须坚决地划清界限，与右派分子斗争到底。章乃器这些混淆阶级界限，美化抬高资产阶级，反对工人阶级领导的这些恶毒的反动言论和行为，我是百思而不得一解；解放后党和政府不咎其既往，而且畀之以重任，这难道说不是党对民主人士的一视同仁吗？假如他稍有人心的话，必将竭尽全力为人民服务以赎前愆。而章乃器则不是这样反而别具心肝，暗中利用其职权培养他的政治资本，在工商界散布反社会主义的言论，进行反动活动，而表面上却说：“爱护党如爱护自己的眼珠一样”，这样的“爱护”是爱护吗？我认为是陷害而不是爱护，他说的话与他所做的事，完全证实他是一个不折不扣的、口是心非的伪君子和两面派。
    另外，还有些工商界人士提出要在公私合营企业内撤消公方代表，说私方人员也能把企业办好，还有的说：“定息要延长二十年，七年定息不算赎买。”这种谬论与章乃器是同出一辙遥相呼应的。我认为这里要弄清一个根本问题：工厂企业的主人是谁？工厂企业的所有财产都是工人阶级劳动剩余价值创造的，资本家剥削了工人许多年，吃工人血汗已超过原资金好多倍，这笔剥削账不是很明显的吗？就是完全将财产没收过来还是清不了债。而我国没有采取没收的办法，采取了和平改造和赎买的办法，并且在公私合营后给私方人员安置工作，采取了包下来的办法，使其各得其所，经过改造变为自食其力的劳动者，可以说对资本家作到了仁至义尽，资本家今天反而提出“要公方代表撤出公私合营企业，定息要延长二十年”，那你们举手赞成的“走社会主义道路，接受共产党领导”又表现在那里呢？所以我说，这些人是口是心非，阳奉阴违；一有空子就想走资本主义道路，资产阶级两面性特别是反动性的一面还很严重，不继续改造行吗？我认为思想改造是长期的，党应该继续改造他们。如果不是别有用心的分子，应老老实实的接受改造，这才是唯一的出路。右派分子野心家妄想把社会拖到资本主义道路上去，使资本主义在中国复辟，可以肯定的说此路不通。我们正告右派分子章乃器等，你们面前只有两条路：幡然悔悟，彻底交代，老老实实接受改造，这是一条光明道路；如仍坚持反动立场，抗拒改造，那就是自绝于人民。
    工商界人士，在这次反右派斗争中，受到了一次极深刻的社会主义教育，走社会主义道路，接受共产党的领导，我们更坚定更明确了，今后我们还必须在实践中认真的把自己改造为自食其力的劳动者，搞好公私共事关系，办好企业，积极地为社会主义建设服务，和全国人民一道共同努力把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
