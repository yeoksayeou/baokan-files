This newspaper Shanghai, July 1st dispatch: The People's Daily editorial "Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Orientation Should Be Criticized" has brought a great impetus to Shanghai's journalism circles.

Shanghai's five newspapers today all reprinted the full text of this editorial. Newspaper staff eagerly read it, believing that this article provided a timely and profound lesson for all journalists in Shanghai.

Wenhui Daily today reprinted the People's Daily editorial on the prominent first page and published two news items exposing the anti-Communist Party activities of the newspaper's Deputy Editor-in-Chief, Pu Xixiu, and the erroneous words and deeds of the newspaper's Director and Editor-in-Chief, Xu Zhucheng. The Wenhui Daily editorial department added an editor's note after the news items. The editor's note said: "When this manuscript was being typeset, the People's Daily editorial 'Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Orientation Should Be Criticized' happened to reach the editorial department. The first comrades to read this editorial were the comrades on the night shift at this newspaper. All comrades unanimously and unreservedly fully support this editorial's serious criticism of this newspaper."

The Wenhui Daily editorial board held a general meeting of all employees this afternoon. Many staff members spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, unanimously agreeing with the criticism in the People's Daily editorial, believing that after reading this article, they further recognized the nature of the serious mistakes Wenhui Daily had made during this period. They expressed that they would correct past errors by strengthening the anti-Rightist struggle under the leadership of the Party. The meeting continued to expose the anti-socialist words and deeds of the Zhang-Luo alliance through Pu Xixiu and others. The Wenhui Daily interviewing department held a meeting this morning, where everyone talked with anger and pain about being deceived by the double-dealing tactics of Pu Xixiu and others in the previous period, leading them to be fooled by Rightist elements. They vowed to thoroughly expose their disguise in the future. Last night, various departments of Wenhui Daily discussed how to conduct self-examination work in a concrete way, so as to conduct responsible self-criticism to readers like Xinmin Daily.

Shanghai Xinmin Daily, Jiefang Daily, and Labor Daily all held enlarged meetings of their editorial boards today. Based on the spirit of this editorial, each editorial board discussed how to strengthen the propaganda of the anti-Rightist struggle. The enlarged meeting of the Xinmin Daily editorial board was very enthusiastic. Cheng Daqian, the newspaper's Deputy Director and Deputy Editor-in-Chief, said at the meeting that the newspaper staff felt excited after reading the People's Daily editorial's assessment of Xinmin Daily, but even more ashamed. The self-examination of some mistakes made by Xinmin Daily in the previous period was not deep enough, and could only be said to be a start. The People's Daily editorial is a great encouragement and spur to us. The meeting finally made some concrete decisions on further improving work and examining errors in the future. Based on the spirit of the editorial, the Jiefang Daily editorial board reviewed the propaganda work during this period and believed that there were still shortcomings in the lack of understanding of the current situation of class struggle. These newspapers have decided to use this People's Daily editorial as one of the recent study documents for study and discussion.

    上海、北京各报工作人员
    拥护本报批评文汇报的社论
    本报上海1日电　人民日报社论“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”给上海新闻界带来了巨大的推动力量。
    上海的五家报纸，今天都全文转载了这篇社论，报社工作人员们都争相阅读，认为这篇文章给上海全体新闻工作者上了及时深刻的一课。
    文汇报今天在一版显要地位上转载了人民日报的社论，并发表了二篇消息，揭露了该报副总编辑浦熙修的反对共产党的领导的活动，和该报社长兼总编辑徐铸成的错误言行。文汇报编辑部在消息的后边加了一个按语。按语说：“本稿发排时，人民日报的社论‘文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判’恰恰传到了编辑部。首先读到这篇社论的是本报值夜班的同志们。所有的同志一致的无保留的完全拥护这篇社论对本报的严肃的批评。”
    文汇报编委会在今天下午召开全体员工大会，许多工作人员在会上踊跃发言，一致同意人民日报社论的批评，认为读了这篇文章以后，才进一步认识了文汇报这一时期来所犯严重错误的性质，他们表示要在党的领导下，以加强反右派斗争的行动来纠正过去的错误。会上继续对章罗同盟通过浦熙修等人进行的反社会主义的言行作了揭发。文汇报采访部在今天上午即举行了会议，大家激愤而痛心地谈到前一时期被浦熙修等人的两面派手法所蒙蔽，以致上了右派分子的当，今后一定要彻底地拆穿他们的伪装。昨天晚上，文汇报各部门即讨论了如何具体地进行检查工作，以便像新民报那样向读者进行负责的自我批判。
    上海新民报、解放日报、劳动报，今天都举行了编委扩大会，各编委会根据这篇社论的精神，讨论了如何加强反右派斗争的宣传问题。新民报的编委扩大会开得很热烈，该报副社长兼副总编辑程大千在会上说，报社工作人员看了人民日报社论对新民报的估计，感到兴奋，但更多的是惭愧。新民报在前一时期一些错误的检查是不够深刻的，只能说是开始，人民日报社论对我们是一个莫大的鼓舞和鞭策。会议最后对今后进一步改进工作检查错误作出了一些具体的决定。解放日报编委会根据社论的精神，检查了这一时期的宣传工作，认为还存在着对当前的阶级斗争的形势认识不足的缺点。这些报纸都决定把人民日报这篇社论作为最近学习文件之一，进行学习和讨论。
