    Interrogation of Zhang Naiqi
    Zhu Jisheng's Speech

    In the eight years since liberation, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, our national bourgeoisie has recognized that only the Chinese Communist Party can save the fate of the Chinese people, and only the Chinese Communist Party can lead the Chinese people from a poor and backward old China to a prosperous and strong socialist society. For our own sake and for the bright future of our future generations, we are willing to sincerely and honestly accept socialist transformation. After further understanding the laws of social development and how to control our own destiny, we have become more determined to take the socialist path. With the arrival of the high tide of complete industry-wide joint ventures, we have smoothly embarked on the broad road of socialism. We have infinite faith in and wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party, and no one can shake our will.
    However, just as the great Chinese Communist Party launched a rectification movement within the Party to accelerate socialist construction and asked non-Party members to help the Party with the rectification, those hidden bourgeois rightists, believing that the time had come, seized this opportunity to spread absurd anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist fallacies everywhere,妄想attempting capitalist restoration. In particular, rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the industrial and commercial circles, catered to their backward sentiments, and used various means of麻醉, deception,挑拨离间, and煽动蛊惑to confuse the ideological understanding of the industrial and commercial circles,妄想attempting to hold us back,帮倒忙 sabotage, and lead us back to the capitalist road. Precisely because of his insidious and malicious methods, he has caused ideological confusion among some industrial and commercial people who lack sufficient study and awareness, affecting their peace of mind in studying, working, and accepting transformation. This sinful behavior is absolutely intolerable to our entire industrial and commercial circles. We must fight Zhang Naiqi and others to the end.
    Today, in this solemn National People's Congress, as a member of the industrial and commercial community, I would like to ask Zhang Naiqi the following:
    1.  As the vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (民建) and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, you have the responsibility to lead and educate industrialists and businessmen to actively accept transformation and strive to serve the cause of national construction. Why do you use your social status to spread anti-Party and anti-socialist poisons to the industrial and commercial circles with flowery words, and maliciously attack the Party? What is your purpose? Is it to煽动 incite us to follow you on the anti-Party, anti-people capitalist road?
    2.  You deny the objective reality of the dual nature of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, insisting that this is because "dogmatists" still戴帽子 put a hat on industrialists and businessmen with this dual nature to make them prone to arrogance and complacency, which is beneficial to transformation; you also say: After seven years of transformation, most of the reactionary landlords have been transformed into working people, so why do we, as allies, still have a dual nature? And you insist on turning the negative side of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie into the "five poisons" and counter-revolution, and ask: Are we going to have another "Five-Anti Campaign"? Are you deliberately distorting facts to maliciously诬蔑诽谤 slander the Party? Are you maliciously挑拨离间 sowing discord between the industrial and commercial circles and the Party?
    3.  You consciously distort Chairman Mao's speech, using language that industrialists and businessmen can understand, believing that Chairman Mao advocates that all classes have a dual nature and must be transformed, as if the working class also has a dual nature. You also deliberately混淆 confuse class boundaries, saying: Historically, the difference between leaders and those led is only the difference between the advanced and the backward. What is the purpose of your毒辣 maliciously distorting Chairman Mao's speech, using the banner of the Chairman to deliberately deny the existence of duality and class relations? Is it that you are妄想 dreaming that the working class will abandon class relations and relax its leadership over the bourgeoisie, to achieve your阴谋诡计 sinister plot to overthrow the leadership of the Party, overthrow the leadership of the working class, and have the bourgeoisie lead according to your intentions?
    4.  You say that fixed interest is not exploitation but isunearned income. Does that mean that fixed interest falls from the sky? Since it is unearned income, then there must be some who work without reward or with little reward, so isn't that exploitation? You also say: The entire industry-wide public-private partnership is a great uprising of bourgeois elements betraying their own class; they are red bourgeoisie. What is your purpose in beautifying the bourgeoisie and抹煞抹煞 erasing the relationship between exploitation and being exploited? Is it that you are trying to哗众取宠 pander to the public and use the ideological weaknesses of the backward side of the industrial and commercial circles to win over the masses, so as to increase your political capital and attack the Party even more狂妄猖狂 frantically?
    5.  You say: Bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism; you also say: Why is it that the work efficiency of some socialist enterprises and even some state organs is not as good as that of modern capitalist enterprises? Why do modern capitalist enterprises have higher work efficiency? We all know that bureaucratism is a product of the exploitative system. Under the socialist system, the occurrence of bureaucratism is a legacy of the old society and a shortcoming in our work. You actually恶毒 maliciously confuse it with the socialist system for comparison, and openly praise capitalism as being superior to the socialist system. No matter how disguised such a hidden and cunning right-wing conspirator is, there will be times when you reveal your tail. Isn't this a public and恶毒 maliciously reactionary act against socialism and against the people?
    There are many more of your absurd and reactionary statements. Today I only raise these few points and ask you to answer them honestly.
    I also want to控诉 denounce: Zhang Naiqi once secretly tried to win me over, wanting me to learn his anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist methods. Last year, when the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium asking everyone to offer more criticisms of the United Front work, I also spoke and made suggestions. During the break, Zhang Naiqi went to great lengths to find me from where he was sitting and said: "Don't use any outline when you speak." At that time, I didn't understand what he meant, but now I understand that he wanted to teach me to learn his insidious method of speaking without an outline. Because if the words spoken are criticized later, you can step back and defend yourself, saying that they were spoken off the cuff and inevitably one-sided. The way he treated me was simply a great insult to me. I oppose it, I控诉 denounce it.
    Also, because you have consistently spread these absurd and reactionary statements in the industrial and commercial circles, you have caused ideological confusion among some industrialists and businessmen,迷惑 confusing the direction of progress for industrialists and businessmen,阻碍 hindering the further transformation of industrialists and businessmen, and causing great losses to the Party and the government in their transformation work. You must be held responsible to the people and to the industrial and commercial circles for this evil result.
    Finally, I warn you. The vast majority of us industrialists and businessmen have improved our ideological awareness to varying degrees under the education and cultivation of the Party. Through various political movements over the years, our eyes have become brighter. We understand that the greatest interest of industrialists and businessmen is to continue to deeply accept transformation, smoothly pass through the transition period, and finally be transformed into glorious laborers. Your sugar-coated bullets with砒霜 arsenic hidden in your sweet words will not work on us. We will never be deceived by you, and you should wake up from your迷梦 daydream of妄想 dreaming about capitalist restoration. The Party and the people are still patiently waiting for you to憣然悔悟 suddenly realize your errors and start anew. Therefore, we are still willing to help you with a friendly attitude. Your fallacies have long been bankrupt. You should bow your head to the people and confess your crimes as soon as possible, sincerely repent, and honestly explain your problems and your reactionary thoughts and behaviors. The door to socialist transformation is still open. If you still persist in your mistakes and resist to the end, you will be cutting yourself off from the people and inviting your own destruction, and the people will never forgive you.

    质问章乃器
    朱继圣的发言
    解放八年来，我们民族资产阶级在中国共产党的领导教育下，认清了只有中国共产党才能挽救中国人民的命运，只有中国共产党才能领导中国人民从贫穷落后的旧中国走向繁荣富强的社会主义社会。我们为了自己，为了后一代儿孙的美好将来，愿意忠诚老实地接受社会主义改造。在我们进一步懂得了社会发展规律和如何掌握自己命运的道理以后，更坚定了走社会主义的信心，随着全行业合营高潮的到来，顺利地走上了社会主义康庄大道。我们对中国共产党是具有无限信仰和竭诚拥护的，任何人也动摇不了我们这个意愿的。
    但是正当伟大的中国共产党为了加速社会主义建设，开展了党内整风运动，并要求党外人士帮助党进行整风的时候，那些隐藏着的资产阶级右派分子，认为时机已到，竟抓住这个机会，到处散播反党、反人民、反社会主义的荒谬言论，妄想资本主义复辟。特别是右派分子章乃器等，利用工商界的弱点，迎合落后一面的心情，运用麻醉、欺骗、挑拨离间、煽动蛊惑各种手段来迷惑工商界的思想认识，妄想拉住我们的后腿，帮倒忙，引到资本主义回头路上去。正由于他这种阴险恶毒的手法，已经使工商界中一部分学习不够、觉悟较差的人，在思想认识上造成混乱，影响了安心学习、安心工作、安心接受改造。这种罪恶行为是我们全体工商界绝不能容忍的。我们一定要向章乃器等斗争到底。
    今天我在这个庄严的人民代表大会上，以工商业者的身份，向章乃器提出以下的质问：
    1、你是民建中央和全国工商联的副主任委员，你负有领导和教育工商业者积极接受改造、努力为祖国建设事业服务的责任。你为什么利用你的社会地位，花言巧语地向工商界散播反党、反社会主义的毒素，并向党进行恶意的攻击？你的目的是为了什么？是不是想煽动我们跟着你走反党、反人民的资本主义道路？
    2、你否认中国民族资产阶级两面性这一客观存在的现实，硬说：这是“教条主义者”为了工商业家容易骄傲自满，仍然给他们戴上这顶两面性的帽子，对改造有利；又说：改造七年了，反动的地主都已经大多数改造成为劳动人民了，何以作为盟友的我们仍然还是两面性？并且你硬把民族资产阶级两面性的消极一面，说成是五毒，是反革命，还问：是不是还要来一个五反？你这样无中生有，故意歪曲事实，是不是有意识的向党诬蔑诽谤？是不是恶毒地挑拨离间工商界与党的关系？
    3、你有意识地歪曲毛主席的讲话，用工商业家理解到的口吻，认为毛主席是主张一切阶级都有两面性，都必须要改造，好像是工人阶级也有两面性。你还故意的混淆阶级界限，说什么：历史上领导与被领导者的区别，都只能是先进与落后的区别。你这样毒辣地歪曲毛主席的讲话，打着主席的幌子故意地否定两面性和阶级关系的存在，目的是为了什么？是不是你在妄想工人阶级放弃阶级关系，放松对资产阶级的领导，来达到你推翻党的领导，推翻工人阶级的领导，本着你的意图由资产阶级来领导的阴谋诡计？
    4、你说定息不是剥削，是不劳而获。难道说定息是平空掉下来的不成？既然是不劳而获，那就一定会有劳而不获或劳而少获的，那不是剥削是什么？你还说：全行业公私合营是资产阶级分子背叛自己阶级的大起义；是红色资产阶级。你这样美化资产阶级，硬把剥削与被剥削的关系一笔抹煞，目地是为了什么？是不是你在哗众取宠，利用工商界落后一面的思想弱点来争取群众，好增加你的政治资本，更加猖狂地向党进攻？
    5、你说：官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人；你又说：何以有些社会主义企业甚至有些国家机关的工作效率反而不如现代化的资本主义企业？何以现代化的资本主义企业会有较高的工作效率呢？我们都知道官僚主义是剥削制度下的产物，在社会主义制度下官僚主义的发生是旧社会遗留下来的影响，是工作中的一项缺点。你竟然恶毒地把它和社会主义制度混淆起来对比，并且公然颂扬资本主义比社会主义制度优越，像你这种隐蔽狡猾的右派阴谋分子，无论怎样伪装，也有露出尾巴的时候，难道说这不是公然恶毒地在反对社会主义、反对人民的反动行为吗？
    你的荒谬反动言论还很多，今天我只提出这几点要你老老实实地回答。
    我还要控诉：章乃器过去曾暗地里想拉拢我，要我学他反党、反人民、反社会主义的手法。去年中共中央统战部召集座谈会要求大家对统战工作多提批评的时候，我也讲了话，提了意见，到休息的时候，章乃器不辞辛苦，远从他坐的地方找到我说：“讲话的时候切不要用任何提纲”，当时我不了解他究竟是什么用意，我现在明白了，他是想教我学他的讲话，不用提纲的阴险方法。因为讲的话如果以后受到批评，还可以退一步为自己辩护，说成那是脱口而出，难免有些片面。他这样对待我，简直是对我莫大侮辱。我反对、我控诉。
    还有，由于你一贯在工商界散播这些荒谬的反动言论，已经在一部分工商业者思想上造成混乱，迷惑了工商业者前进的方向，阻碍了工商业者的进一步改造，给党和政府在改造工作中带来很大损失。这种恶果，你要向人民负责，向工商界负责。
    最后向你提出警告。我们工商业者绝大多数在党的教育培养下，思想觉悟都有了不同程度的提高，历年来通过各项政治运动，眼睛更擦亮了，我们懂得工商业者最大的利益是继续深入接受改造，平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，最后改造成为光荣的劳动者，你这甜言蜜语内藏砒霜的糖衣炮弹，在我们身上是起不了任何作用的，我们绝不会受你的欺骗，你那妄想资本主义复辟的迷梦应该觉醒了。党和人民仍在耐心地等待着你憣然悔悟，从新作人。因此，我们仍愿意抱着与人为善的态度对你进行帮助。你的谬论早已破产了，你应当及早低头向人民认罪，真诚悔过，老老实实交代你的问题，交代你的反动思想行为。社会主义改造的大门还是敞开着的。如果你仍然坚持错误、顽抗到底，那就是自绝于人民，自取毁灭，人民是绝不能加以宽恕的。
