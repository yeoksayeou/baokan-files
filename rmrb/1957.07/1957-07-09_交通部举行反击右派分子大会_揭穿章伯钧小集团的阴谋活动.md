The Ministry of Communications held a meeting in Beijing yesterday afternoon for all staff members to counterattack rightist elements, exposing the counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist conspiracy of rightist element Zhang Bojun. More than two hundred people requested to speak at the meeting. Speakers exposed a series of anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership speeches and actions carried out by Zhang Bojun and his confidants Wang Yifan (Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Deputy Director of the Highway General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications), Yang Yitang (Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications), Qiu Kehui (Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Deputy Director of the People's Communications Publishing House), Wu Shaoshu (Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Deputy Director of the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Communications), and Wang Jiyi (Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Deputy Director of the Shipyard Bureau of the Ministry of Communications).

Zhang Bojun also attended the meeting.

The meeting began at 2:30 PM and ended at 6:30 PM.

Zhang Bojun Sent Out Five Generals to Spark Fires Everywhere, Pulling Those Dissatisfied with the Party into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

Qiu Yuexi, member of the China Democratic League and editor of the People's Communications Publishing House, exposed Zhang Bojun for engaging in illegal anti-socialist activities under a legal guise. He said that when the Communist Party's rectification campaign began, Zhang Bojun used the organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party to send five generals to various places to recruit troops and spark fires everywhere. He sent Yang Yitang to Shandong, Wang Yifan to the Northeast, and Wang Jiyi to Shanghai. Wherever they went, they specifically sought out people who were dissatisfied with the Party to hold discussion meetings, and then absorbed them into the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, in order to expand Zhang Bojun's political capital for engaging in anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. Wang Yifan's method of developing the organization was not like fishing with a single hook, but casting a wide net. They developed more than two hundred people in Tianjin in a single month. Their work was planned, step-by-step, and with a program. Zhang Bojun ordered his accomplices to complete these tasks before the upcoming People's Congress. What kind of people were Zhang Bojun's five generals? Take Wang Yifan, for example. He once served under Chiang Ching-kuo as the director of the guidance section of the Jiangxi Training Corps (a secret service). Because he had experience in training reactionary backbones, Zhang Bojun ordered him to take control of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. For Zhang Bojun, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party had two sets of cadres. He described those who had done some unspeakable things in the past as his own cadres and handed them over to Wang Yifan. When Zhang's "Political Design Institute" fallacy was exposed in society, Wang Yifan said, "I have a way to refute them." He had written an article to defend Zhang Bojun, but as the people's anti-rightist sentiment rose day by day, Wang Yifan did not dare to publish the article.

Another of Zhang Bojun's confidants, Yang Yitang, has always been against the Party committee system.

Wang Jiyi was once a murderer in the "April 12th" massacre and an accomplice of the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Hu. He verbally supported the Party but actually cursed it behind its back. He was also a confidant of Zhang Bojun. Zhang Bojun admitted at a symposium of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party that the son-in-law of a special agent named Zhu Peide, Sun Fu, ate at Zhang Bojun's house during the day and lived at Wang Jiyi's house at night.

Zhuang Mingyuan was once a confidant of Chen Cheng. When Chen Cheng was the Minister of Political Affairs, Zhuang was his assistant; when Chen was the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, Zhuang was the director of the Reserve Division. Zhuang Mingyuan was also a central member of the Three People's Principles Youth League.

Qiu Kehui's travel expenses from Hong Kong to Beijing were provided by Huang Qixiang, and his nomination as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League was made by Zhang Bojun.

Wu Pei, a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and a staff member of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, said that Zhang Bojun and others developed the organization by any means, and those developed were all extremely dissatisfied with the Party. For example, they knew that Fu Hao's history was complicated and could not be passed by the fourth branch, but in the first branch (all new members), they tried every means to pass him once or twice by deception and coercion. He said that after Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks were exposed, the executive bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party was still issuing instructions to continue recruiting party members, indicating that this was premeditated by Zhang Bojun and the right-wing group. Zhang Bojun once said to Yang Yitang that the more members the organization had, the greater the power, and the more it could be "sold for."

Zhang Bojun sent one of his generals, Lin Deming, to set fires in the Labor and Wage Bureau and the Shipyard Bureau. As soon as the rectification campaign began in the Supply Bureau, Lin Deming discussed with me, attempting to hold a symposium of people with low morale to collect opinions on the Party and attempt to provoke relations between the Party and the masses. When the Party branch of the Communist Party of China's Supply Bureau held a symposium for democratic parties, Lin Deming asked me to sort out key materials, saying that they would be sent to the municipal committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Party, but in fact he was collecting materials to attack the Party.

Tang Honglie, director of the Chemical Laboratory of the Ministry of Communications and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said that Zhang Bojun's confidants, Yang Yitang, Wang Yifan, and others, reportedly organized more than five hundred people to participate in symposiums in Beijing within a month, holding more than twenty sessions and stirring up trouble. Zhang Bojun, who usually did not even attend bureau affairs meetings, also presided over meetings on school business issues within the Ministry of Communications in his capacity as minister, spreading reactionary remarks at the meetings, plotting to create trouble, and fueling the flames.

Zhang Bojun Said: China Has "One God, Nine Million Puritans, Ruling Five Hundred Million Serfs, Rebellion is Inevitable."

Sun Daguang, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Communications, pointed out when exposing Zhang Bojun's absurd anti-socialist remarks: Zhang Bojun's conspiracy has been going on for a long time. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the CPC Central Committee put forward the "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and other ten principles in May last year, Zhang Bojun has spread many malicious fallacies on many occasions. Sun Daguang cited two examples: The first example, after the Party's ten principles were put forward, Sun went to Zhang Bojun's office to find him. After talking about work issues, they also talked about the Party's principles. At that time, Zhang Bojun said excitedly: "'Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision,' I had this opinion a long time ago, but I just didn't say it. China is so big, one God, nine million Puritans (at that time there were nine million party members in the country), ruling five hundred million serfs, rebellion is inevitable." At that time, I asked him to explain what he meant by one God and what Puritans meant. Under my questioning, he explained that God was Marxism-Leninism, and Puritans were party members. He not only attacked our party, but also insulted the five hundred million farmers in the country. The second example, after the National System Conference, I asked him how the meeting went. He took the opportunity to say: "Now the authority of the Ministry is too small, there are too many people managing above, there are commissions and offices, and above the party group there is also the Industrial and Transportation Department, so in reality nothing can be managed; therefore, ministers are not very enthusiastic, those with enthusiasm are the vice-premiers or those responsible for concurrently holding some commission or office. If I were in the party, I would also concurrently hold something else. Why does a patient still have to be given the title of vice-premier? Now there are many problems in the cultural and educational circles, how can Lin Feng manage the cultural and educational work well?" From these remarks, it can be seen that Zhang Bojun is not satisfied with our national system, especially not satisfied with his current position. He wants to abolish the superior leadership, at least to be the vice-premier himself. He wants to engage in cultural and educational work, and wants to use the convenience of cultural and educational work positions to control intellectuals. Sun Daguang said that it is no wonder that Zhang Bojun wanted to set fires in many schools at the beginning of this campaign to help the Party rectify itself.

Li Yingyuan, a relative of Zhang Bojun and a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, also spoke at the meeting. He expressed his willingness to draw a clear line between himself and Zhang Bojun ideologically. He said: Zhang Bojun once said: "I may develop into a counter-revolutionary at any time." This time, after Shi Liang exposed Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks in the newspaper, he sat on the sofa, holding a small teapot, and said to me: Since the teapot is broken, what's the use of regretting it. Then he said with deep meaning: It is best to buy another one, but if you can't afford it, you can buy a teacup. Does this insidious statement have any intention of trying to muddle through and attempting to revive?

Zhang Bojun Strived to Benefit Capitalists, Causing Losses to State Property

Zhang Weijin of the Local Shipping Office of the Haihe Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications exposed Zhang Bojun for sitting on the bench of the bourgeoisie and speaking for the bourgeoisie. He said: The capitalist Yu Shunwei had a ship named Dongshan, which was salvaged by a state-owned salvage company. Later, Yu Shunwei's brothers came to Beijing and planned together with Zhang Bojun. Under Zhang's activities, the Dongshan ship was re-identified and the valuation was finalized. After the capitalists tasted the sweetness, they demanded that the state-owned enterprise return the Longan ship to the capitalists, and the salvage fee was mortgaged with three broken ships that were still sunk at the bottom of the sea and the river (in fact, some of these three ships had been sold by the capitalists to the Asian Salvage Company). Zhang Bojun strongly supported this matter, causing losses to state property. These practices violated state regulations. Zhang Bojun, as a minister, did not abide by government laws and regulations, but went to fight for the interests of the bourgeoisie. Now we want Zhang Bojun to explain why he spoke for the capitalists? What is his relationship with the Shanghai gangster boss Yu Qiaqing (Yu Shunwei's father)?

Zhang Bojun Said: The Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries Should Be Handed Over to the Democratic Parties. He also said that if the Party does not accept their opinions, it will lead to a Hungarian incident.

Wang Xianzhang, an engineer and member of the China Democratic League, said that Zhang Bojun made many anti-socialist fallacies. I have heard him make fallacies twice. Zhang Bojun said that deviations occurred in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries, and it should be handed over to the democratic parties! He used this as an excuse to attack the Party. Zhang Bojun said that the People's Daily is full of dogmatism. He also said: "Every time the Central Committee launches a movement, it asks us to offer opinions, which is completely formalism." Zhang Bojun once said that democratic parties should have democratic and free opportunities in the future. Now the democratic parties are not children, and no longer need to be helped to walk. He said that the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party were not established with the help of the Communist Party, so they should be independent. These two parties can stand on an equal footing with the Communist Party. Zhang Bojun also said, we should do a good job in the group, the Communist Party put forward "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision", we must create conditions ourselves. Zhang Bojun said that if the Communist Party does not accept our opinions, it will be troublesome if a Hungarian incident occurs.

Zhang Bojun Often Abandoned His Duty, But Claimed to Have a Position Without Power

Zhang Bojun, kept saying that he has "a position without power," what are the facts? Zhang Qizong, director of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Communications, said that the Ministry of Communications held forty-nine ministerial office meetings and bureau affairs meetings last year, and he only attended twelve of them. In the first half of this year, the Ministry of Communications held twenty bureau affairs meetings, and he only attended three. He was invited to participate, but he did not participate. Obviously, Zhang Bojun is not "a position without power," but abandoning his duty.

Xu Lan, a member of the Communist Youth League, exposed Zhang Bojun's crime of spreading reactionary remarks and poisoning young people in the Ministry of Communications. Xu Lan said that Zhang Bojun often spread reactionary remarks in front of young people in the Ministry of Communications. Once, when Zhang Bojun was talking to many young people, he separated socialism and democratic freedom, saying that they were two different things.

Finally, Zhang Siqi, secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Ministry of Communications, announced on behalf of more than nine hundred members of the Communist Youth League of the Ministry of Communications: All members of the League unanimously and firmly counterattack right-wing elements, and we will never give up until we achieve complete victory.

Ai Zhaochang, a model worker of the national transportation system, engineers Wang Xianzhang, Shi Guangyan, Hu Fujiu, Lu Yugui, and Sun Yingtong, a student of the Marxism-Leninism Research Class of Renmin University, also spoke at today's meeting.

    交通部举行反击右派分子大会
    揭穿章伯钧小集团的阴谋活动
    本报讯　交通部在京机关全体工作人员于昨天下午举行反击右派分子大会，揭露右派分子章伯钧反共反社会主义的阴谋罪行。会上要求发言的有两百多人。发言的人都揭露了章伯钧及其亲信王一帆（农工民主党中央委员、交通部公路总局副局长），杨逸棠（农工民主党中央委员、交通部办公厅副主任）丘克辉（民盟候补中央委员、人民交通出版社副社长），吴绍澍（民革候补中央委员、交通部参事室副主任），王寄一（农工民主党中央委员、交通部船厂局副局长）等，进行的一系列的反对社会主义反对党的领导的言论和行动。
    章伯钧也参加了这个大会。
    大会自下午二时半开始到六时半结束。
    章伯钧派出五员大将到处点火，把对党不满的人拉进农工民主党
    民盟盟员、人民交通出版社编辑仇岳希揭露章伯钧以合法地位干反对社会主义的非法勾当。他说，共产党整风开始，章伯钧就用农工党的组织，派五员大将，到各地去招兵买马，到处点火。他派杨逸棠到山东，王一帆到东北，王寄一到上海。他们所到之处，专门找一些对党不满的人开座谈会，然后将他们吸收参加农工民主党，以扩大章伯钧的政治资本，进行反共、反人民、反社会主义的勾当。王一帆发展组织的方式，不是钓鱼式的，而是撒大网。他们在天津一个月就发展二百多。他们的工作是有计划、有步骤、有纲领的。章伯钧命令他的同伙，要把这些工作在这次人代会前夕做好。章伯钧的五员大将，是些什么人物呢？拿王一帆来说，他曾在蒋经国手下，担任江西省训练团（特务机关）指导处的处长。因为他训练反动骨干有经验，章伯钧就叫他掌握农工民主党的大权。对于章伯钧来说，农工党有两套干部。他把历史上干过一些不可告人的事情的人，说成是他自己的干部。交给王一帆掌握。在社会上揭发章的“政治设计院”谬论时，王一帆说：“我有办法驳他们”。他曾写了一篇文章为章伯钧辩护，但是人民反右派情绪一天天在高涨，王一帆的文章就没敢拿出来。
    章伯钧的另一个亲信杨逸棠一贯是反对党委制的。
    王寄一曾是“四·一二”血案的凶手，反革命罪犯杨虎的帮手。他口口声声说拥护党，实际是当面捧场，背后骂娘。他也是章伯钧的心腹之人。章伯钧在农工民主党中央座谈会上承认，有一个特务朱培德的女婿叫孙福，白天在章伯钧家吃饭，晚上住在王寄一家。
    庄明远曾是陈诚的心腹。陈诚作政治部长时，庄作助手；陈作军政部长时，庄作储备司司长。庄明远还是三青团的中央干事。
    丘克辉从香港来北京的路费是黄琪翔给的，他的民盟中央候补委员是章伯钧提名的。
    农工民主党党员、交通部材料供应局科员吴霈说，章伯钧等人发展组织，不择手段，发展的都是一些对党异常不满的人。例如，他们明知符浩历史复杂，在第四支部通不过，却在第一支部（都是新成员）千方百计的一次两次用欺骗压服的办法通过了。他说，章伯钧的反动言论被揭发后，农工党执行局还在发布指示继续吸收党员，说明这是章伯钧和右派分子集团事先预谋好的。章伯钧曾向杨逸棠说过，组织成员越多，力量越大，就越能“卖钱”。
    章伯钧派他的一员大将林德名还到劳动工资局、船厂局等处去放火。供应局整风一开始，林德名就同我商量，企图召开一次情绪低落的人的座谈会，搜集对党的意见，企图挑拨党群关系。中共供应局党支部召开民主党派座谈会，林德名要我整理重点材料，说是送到农工党市委去的，实际上他是在搜集向党进攻的材料。
    交通部化验室主任、民革成员唐鸿烈说，章伯钧的亲信杨逸棠，王一帆等人，一个月之内，据说在北京组织五百多人参加座谈会，先后举行了二十几次，大点其火。平时连部务会议都不参加的章伯钧，这时还以部长身份主持交通部内有关学校业务问题的会议，在会上散播反动言论，阴谋生事添非，兴波助浪。
  章伯钧说：中国“一个上帝，九百万清教徒，统治着五亿农奴，非造反不行”。
    交通部部长助理孙大光在揭发章伯钧的反对社会主义的荒谬言论的时候指出：章伯钧的阴谋活动是由来已久的。自从苏共二十次代表大会以后，特别是去年5月间中共中央提出“长期共存互相监督”等十大方针以后，章伯钧在不少的场合散布了许多恶毒的谬论。孙大光举了两个例子：第一个例子，党的十大方针提出后，孙到章伯钧的办公室去找他，在谈完工作上的问题以后，又谈到了党的方针。当时章伯钧很兴奋地说：“‘长期共存互相监督’，我早就有这个意见，我就是不讲。中国这样大，一个上帝，九百万清教徒（那个时候全国是九百万党员），统治着五亿农奴，非造反不行。”当时，我要他解释一下，所谓一个上帝是指什么，清教徒又指的是什么？在我的追问下他才解释说，上帝就是马列主义，清教徒就是党员。他不仅攻击了我们的党，而且还侮辱了全国五亿农民。第二个例子，全国体制会议以后，我问他会开的怎样？他又乘机说：“现在部的权限太小了，上面管的人太多，有委有办，党组上面还有工业交通部，实际上管不了什么事；所以当部长的劲头都不大，有劲头的是那些副总理或兼什么委什么办的负责人。我要是党内的，我也要兼点旁的什么事。为什么一个病号还要挂副总理的名义？现在文教界问题很多，林枫怎么能把文教工作办好？”从这些言论中可以看出，章伯钧对我们国家制度是不满意的，尤其不满意的是他现在的职位。他是想取消上级领导，至少由他来担任副总理。他想搞文教工作，想利用文教工作岗位的方便来控制知识分子。孙大光说，难怪这次帮助党整风一开始，章伯钧就要在许多学校中放火了。
    章伯钧的亲戚、农工民主党党员李应元也在会上发了言。他表示要和章伯钧划清思想界限。他说：章伯钧曾说：“我随时可能发展为反革命。”这次，史良在报上揭发了章伯钧的反动言论后，他坐在沙发上，手捧小茶壶对我说：茶壶既然打破了，反悔有什么用。接着他含意颇深地说：能再买一把最好，假如买不起，买个茶杯也可以。这种阴险的说法，是否会有蒙混过关企图死灰复燃的打算呢？
      章伯钧极力为资本家争利，使国家财产遭受损失
    交通部海河运输局地方船运处张维谨揭发章伯钧屁股坐在资产阶级板凳上，为资产阶级说话。他说：资本家虞顺慰有艘东山号轮船，被国营打捞企业打捞上来了。后来虞顺慰兄弟来北京和章伯钧共同策划，在章的活动下，将东山轮重新鉴定，估价定案。资本家吃了甜头以后，又要求将国营企业打捞起来的龙安轮交还给资本家，打捞费以仍然沉在海底、江底的三条破船抵押。（实际上这三条船中间，有的已为资本家出卖给亚洲打捞公司了。）这件事章伯钧竭力支持，使国家财产遭到了损失。这些做法，是违反国家规定的，章伯钧身为部长，不遵守政府法令，却去给资产阶级争利。现在我们要章伯钧交代为什么替资本家说话？他和上海的流氓头子虞洽卿（虞顺慰的父亲）有什么关系？
    章伯钧说：肃反应当交给民主党派去搞。他又说，如果党不接受他们的意见，就会闹成匈牙利事件。
    工程师民盟盟员王宪章说，章伯钧作了很多反社会主义的谬论。我听过他发表两次谬论。章伯钧说肃反发生了偏差，还是交给民主党派来搞吧！他以这个作为向党进攻的借口。章伯钧说人民日报全是教条主义。他还说：“中央每到一个运动的时候，就让我们提意见，这完全是形式主义。”章伯钧曾经说过今后民主党派要有民主自由的机会，现在民主党派不是一个小孩子，已经不需要人掺着走路了。他说民主同盟和农工民主党不是共产党帮助建立的，因此应该有独立性，这两个党可以与共产党分庭抗礼。章伯钧还说，我们在小组里好好搞一下子，共产党提出来“长期共存，互相监督”，我们自己要创造条件。章伯钧说，假如共产党不接受我们的意见，闹成匈牙利事件就麻烦了。
    章伯钧常常放弃职守，却扬言有职无权
    章伯钧，口口声声说他“有职无权”，事实是怎样的呢？交通部秘书处处长张启宗说，去年，交通部召开过四十九次部长办公会议和部务会议，他只参加过十二次。今年上半年，交通部开过二十次部务会议，他只参加了三次。请他参加，他不参加。显然，章伯钧不是“有职无权”，而是放弃职守。
    共青团员徐岚揭露了章伯钧在交通部散布反动言论毒害青年的罪行。徐岚说，章伯钧在交通部常在青年人面前散布反动言论。有一次，章伯钧在和许多青年人谈话时，把社会主义和民主自由分开，说这是两件事。
    最后，共青团交通部团委书记张思奇代表交通部九百多名共青团员宣布：全体团员一致坚决反击右派分子，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    今天会上发言的还有全国交通系统的劳动模范艾肇昌，工程师王宪章、石光岩、胡福久，陆聿贵，人民大学马列主义研究班学生孙映通等人。
