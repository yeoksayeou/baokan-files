    Tightly Guarding the First Gate of Capital Construction
    Xi'an Design Units Save Large Amounts of Funds and Building Materials

    (Our Newspaper News) (Our Newspaper Reporter Li Qian reports): Design units in the Xi'an area are practicing careful calculation and rational design, saving large amounts of funds and building materials for the country. According to incomplete statistics, the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch, the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute, the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute, and the Xi'an Municipal Design Institute have already saved more than 14.9 million yuan in funds for the country this year. In terms of saving building materials, the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch and the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute alone have saved the country more than 2,700 tons of steel, more than 4,200 tons of cement, and more than 680 cubic meters of wood.

    Is There No Problem With Designs Based on National Quotas?

    First, the design units, based on China's current economic situation, reviewed and revised the drawings that had been designed but not yet constructed. The President and Chief Engineer of the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute, together with the design personnel, re-examined the drawings for the Lanzhou Baiyin Factory's workers' club, halal canteen, and Jiaotong University's all-weather playground. Initially, some people thought that the Baiyin Factory's club and halal canteen were designed according to the national quotas stipulated in 1957, so there wouldn't be a big problem. However, the results of the review showed that there were quite a few problems. For example, the original design of the halal canteen, in addition to the kitchen and dining room, also included a small shop, office, shower room, toilet, and several storage rooms for storing different types of vegetables. After research, it was decided to cancel the office, shower room, toilet, etc. (these facilities are available within the factory), and merge the storage rooms, thus saving one-third of the building area and 6,830 yuan in investment. The Baiyin Factory's workers' club originally had 27 rooms of various sizes, including a hall, culture room, art room, reading room, children's activity room, telephone switchboard room, cloakroom, etc. After studying, they decided to cancel some unnecessary rooms, which could save more than 34,800 yuan in investment. The all-weather playground of Jiaotong University was originally designed with heating, a teacher's lounge, and a shower room, and even the area where the audience stood was wooden flooring. From the perspective of China's current economic situation, the standard was too high. They have already made suggestions to Jiaotong University to make appropriate modifications. Now, the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute has conducted a general revision of the drawings of more than 20 projects that have been designed but not yet constructed.

    Foreign Designs Also Have Points Worth Studying

    In addition to revising the engineering drawings designed by themselves, the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch also cooperated with the construction unit to make appropriate modifications to the eight foreign designs under construction, saving the country more than 7 million yuan. Their principles for modifying foreign designs are: wherever the standards are too high or the safety factors are too large compared with China's actual situation, they should be appropriately lowered without affecting production; on the premise of ensuring quality, domestic materials and equipment should be used as much as possible to replace foreign products. For example, the insulation project of the Xi'an No. 3 Power Plant originally used imported magnesium carbonate boards, but after research, it was changed to domestic diatomaceous earth or foam concrete, which can reduce the cost by more than 1 million yuan.

    Try to Use Domestic Equipment and Local Building Materials

    These units have also begun to try their best to utilize domestic equipment and relatively inexpensive building materials in some newly designed projects, based on the spirit of "building the country with diligence and thrift" and "making use of whatever is available." For example, the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute used to invest 10 million yuan in designing a mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons. Recently, they started designing the Shizuishan mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons. Because all domestic equipment was used, and some of the mechanization of ground equipment was appropriately reduced without affecting production efficiency and output, and the auxiliary plant buildings were designed as brick-wood structures, and the dormitories were designed as brick-pillar adobe structure bungalows, only 7 to 8 million yuan of investment is needed. In the first half of the year, the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute designed more than 33,000 square meters of adobe cave dwellings as dormitories for some government agencies and enterprises. These adobe cave dwellings can save more than 59,000 yuan in investment compared with mixed-structure buildings of the same area, and can save a lot of steel and cement.

    Give Play to Collective Wisdom, Design Multiple Plans

    These units paid special attention to giving play to collective wisdom in the design. After the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch accepted the task of designing an 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission line in the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, it put forward the subject to the design personnel. Later, according to the ten electric pole design schemes proposed by everyone, after multiple discussions and economic and technical comparisons, it finally successfully designed a "×"-shaped double-circuit concrete prefabricated electric pole. It is the first time in the world to use concrete prefabricated electric poles to replace iron towers to erect 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines. An "×"-shaped concrete electric pole saves 1.5 tons of steel and more than 1,000 yuan in construction funds compared with an iron tower. The 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission project designed by this design institute for the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can therefore save 210 tons of steel and 150,000 yuan in investment. At present, this type of electric pole has begun to be promoted in other regions.

    When the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute was carrying out the standardized design of four- and five-story residential buildings in Lanzhou in 1957, it launched a design competition. The 47 design personnel participating in the competition proposed 24 design schemes. After discussion and evaluation by the institute's technical committee, four better schemes were selected, and based on the scheme collectively created by the Hua Guanqiu group, the advantages of the other three schemes were absorbed to design a residential building that was both economical and practical, and the cost was 5% to 10% lower than the 1957 national quota.

    Carry Out Principled Struggle Against Unreasonable Requirements of Construction Units

    The designers of these units, realizing that design is the first process of capital construction and is of great importance to saving funds, treat the design tasks they undertake with the attitude of masters, and strive to avoid various wastes.

    Some design units have made suggestions to postpone or cancel some construction projects based on the information they have. For example, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry approved the addition of a transmission line from Changshou to Chongqing in 1958. After accepting the design task for this project, the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch calculated in detail the local power supply and power consumption, and found that the local power supply could still be sufficient in 1958 without building this line, so it suggested to the Ministry of Electric Power Industry to stop the construction of this project. Now, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has agreed to this suggestion, which can save the country more than 140 million yuan of funds.

    Some design units have also carried out principled struggles against some requirements of the construction units that do not conform to the principle of thrift. For example, the Xi'an Instrument Factory commissioned the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute to design a dormitory project, which originally required heating equipment. Because the climate in the Xi'an area is not too cold, the Northwest Industrial Architecture Design Institute suggested that heating equipment should not be installed, and at the same time, canceling the heating equipment can also reduce the rent burden of employees, so it suggested that the construction unit not install heating. After both parties requested instructions from the National Construction Commission, the National Construction Commission finally decided not to install heating, which resulted in saving a lot of funds for the country.

    紧紧守着基本建设的第一关
    西安的设计单位节约了大量资金和建筑材料
    本报讯　本报记者李茜报道：西安地区的设计单位在精打细算，合理设计，为国家节约了大量资金和建筑材料。据不完全统计，西安电力设计分院、西北工业建筑设计院、西安煤矿设计院、西安市设计院等四个单位，今年已为国家节约了一千四百九十多万元资金。在建筑材料节约方面，仅西安电力设计分院和西北工业建筑设计院就为国家节省了二千七百多吨钢材、四千二百多吨水泥和六百八十多立方公尺木材。
    按照国家定额设计的就没有问题吗？
    各设计单位首先根据我国目前的经济情况，对已经设计出图尚未施工的图纸进行了审查和修改。西北工业建筑设计院的院长、总工程师同设计人员一起重新审查了兰州白银厂的职工俱乐部、清真食堂和交通大学风雨操场的图纸。开始有些人认为，白银厂的俱乐部和清真食堂是按照国家1957年规定的定额设计的，问题不会很大。但是审查的结果，问题却不少。如清真食堂的原设计中除了厨房和餐厅以外，还有小卖部、办公室、淋浴室、厕所和储藏不同菜类的几个储藏室。经研究后，决定将办公室、淋浴室、厕所等取消（这些设施厂内都有），将储藏室合并，这样就节省了三分之一的建筑面积和六千八百三十元投资。白银厂的一个职工俱乐部，原设计中除大厅以外，还有文化室、美术室、阅览室、儿童活动室、电话总机室、衣帽间等大小二十七个房间。他们研究后决定把一些不必要的房间取消，可以节省三万四千八百多元的投资。交通大学的风雨操场，原来设计有暖气，有教员休息室和淋浴室，甚至连观众站的地方都是木头地板。从我国目前的经济情况来看，标准也是过高了。他们已经向交大提出建议，准备作适当修改。现在，西北工业建筑设计院已经对设计出图尚未施工的二十多项工程图纸普遍进行了一次修改。
    国外设计也有值得研究之处
    西安电力设计分院除了修改自己设计的工程图纸以外，还配合建设单位对正在施工的八项国外设计作了适当的修改，共为国家节约了七百多万元。他们修改国外设计的原则是：凡是同我国实际情况比较，标准过高、安全系数过大的，在不影响生产的情况下作适当降低；在保证质量的前提下，凡是国内材料和设备能够代替国外产品的，就尽可能改用国产材料和设备。例如西安第三发电厂的保温工程，原设计采用的材料是进口的碳酸镁板，经研究后改为国产的矽藻土或泡沫混凝土，可以降低造价一百多万元。
    尽量采用国内设备和地方建筑材料
    这些单位在新设计的一些工程中，也开始根据“勤俭建国”、“因陋就简”的精神，尽量利用国内设备和比较便宜的建筑材料。如西安煤矿设计院过去设计的年产三十万吨的矿井一般要一千万元的投资，最近他们开始设计的年产三十万吨的石咀山矿井，由于全部采用国内设备，并在不影响生产效率和产量的条件下，适当降低了一些地面设备的机械化程度，把辅助厂房设计成砖木结构，把宿舍设计成砖柱土坯结构的平房，只要七百至八百万元的投资就够了。西安煤矿设计院上半年设计了三万三千多平方公尺的土坯窑洞楼房，作为一些机关、企业的宿舍。这些土坯窑洞楼房比同样面积的混合结构楼房可以节约五万九千多元的投资，并可节约很多钢筋和水泥。
    发挥集体智慧，设计多种方案
    这些单位在设计时特别注意发挥集体智慧。西安电力设计分院在接受了设计宝成路北段一条十一万伏高压输电线的任务以后，即向设计人员提出课题，后来根据大家提出的十种电杆设计方案，经过多次讨论和进行经济技术比较，终于设计成功了一种“×”形双回路混凝土预制电杆。用混凝土预制电杆代替铁塔架设十一万伏高压输电线，在世界上还是第一次采用。一条“×”形混凝土电杆要比一座铁塔省一吨半钢材和一千多元的建设资金。这个设计院为宝成路北段设计的十一万伏高压输电工程，因此就可节约二百一十吨钢材和十五万元的投资。目前，这种电杆已经开始在其他地区推广。
    西北工业建筑设计院在进行兰州1957年四、五层楼房住宅的定型设计的时候，开展了设计方案竞赛。参加竞赛的四十七名设计人员提出了二十四个设计方案，经过该院技术委员会的讨论和评比，选定了四个较好的方案，并以华冠球小组集体创造的方案为主，吸收其他三个方案的优点，设计出了一种既经济又适用的住宅，造价比1957年国家定额还低5％到10％。
    同建设单位的不合理要求进行原则斗争
    这些单位的设计人员们由于认识到设计是基本建设的第一道工序，对节约资金关系重大，所以他们都以主人翁的态度对待自己承担的设计任务，力求避免各种浪费。
    有的设计单位曾经根据自己掌握的资料提出了推迟或取消一些建设项目的建议。如电力工业部曾批准1958年增设一条长寿至重庆的输电线路，西安电力设计分院接受了这项工程的设计任务以后，详细地计算了当地的供电和用电量，发现1958年不建这条线路当地的电力也可以够用，就向电力工业部提出停建这项工程的建议。现在，电力工业部已经同意了这一建议，可使国家节约一百四十多元的资金。
    有些设计单位还对建设单位提出的一些不合乎节约原则的要求进行了原则性的斗争。如西安仪表厂委托西北工业建筑设计院设计的宿舍工程，原来要求有暖气设备，西北工业建筑设计院因为西安地区的气候并不太冷，可以不要暖气设备，同时取消暖气设备还可以减少职工的房租负担，便建议建设单位不安装暖气。经过双方请示国家建设委员会，最后由国家建委决定不装暖气，结果给国家节省了不少资金。
