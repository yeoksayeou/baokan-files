Allocated 5% of Private Plots to Commune Members
Sun Dekui
The Fuqiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hegan Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, according to the instructions of the Anyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, increased the private plots of the commune members to 5% of the average local cultivated land area per person, which was unanimously supported by all commune members. The commune members said: "By doing this, a family of ten can keep one and a half mu of land (this cooperative has an average of three mu of land per person). Half a mu can be used to grow vegetables, and one mu can be used to grow grain. If managed well, it can yield 600 jin, which can be used to feed pigs and raise chickens, and life can be good."

The allocation of private plots is a very complex task. The Cooperative Management Committee convened a meeting of commune member representatives to allow commune members to fully discuss and act according to their opinions, achieving everyone's satisfaction.

The first problem encountered in the allocation work was that everyone wanted land that was close and good, and no one wanted land that was far and bad; everyone wanted to keep the increased private plots together with the original private plots. What to do? The solution was: allocate the quota of private plots to be retained by the entire cooperative to the production teams according to the number of mu that each team should receive, and let each team discuss the specific allocation. When the teams were allocating, they tried to ensure that each household's private plot had water conservancy conditions (land was allocated by well), the original vegetable plots of each household were generally left untouched, and the newly added plots were allocated separately. Some commune members requested that the newly added vegetable plots be connected to the original vegetable plots, so individual adjustments would be made between households after the autumn harvest.

There were also a series of specific issues during the allocation:

First, who owns the firewood and straw of grain crops on the private plots? After discussion, it was decided that it belongs to the commune members themselves. Second, will private plots be increased or decreased in the future if the population increases or decreases? It was decided that there would be no more changes in the future. Third, should private plots be retained for students, cadres, and relocated people who are away? It was decided not to retain them, and the allocation would be based on the current population. Fourth, should private plots be retained for soldiers who are away? In order to take care of the families of soldiers, and because soldiers will return after three years of service, it was decided to retain them. However, private plots will not be retained for officers who are away, and those who have transferred to other jobs outside after returning will not retain them. Fifth, all private plots are irrigated by wells, so what should be done with the waterwheels, which have become the common property of the cooperative? It was decided that commune members can use them free of charge and are responsible for their safekeeping. If there is any damage, the repair costs will be shared by the commune members according to the acreage of their private plots. Sixth, with the increase in private plots, how to solve the problem of draught animals? It is planned to implement the method of "joint feeding of livestock, decentralized to households, combining raising and using" to solve it. Seventh, how to solve the problem of the time that commune members spend on production on their private plots? It is temporarily stipulated to implement the Sabbath system, allowing commune members one day out of seven to do farm work on their private plots. Eighth, commune members may intensively cultivate their private plots and increase the amount of fertilizer, which may affect the amount of coarse fertilizer used within the cooperative. What should be done about this? It was decided to carry out regular fertilizer accumulation work and strengthen specific leadership to resolve the contradiction between the cooperative and the commune members in the use of fertilizer.

The allocation of private plots in this cooperative is largely completed, and commune members will be able to allocate enough 5% of their private plots for planting after the wheat harvest.

    给社员分了5％的自留地
    孙德魁
    河南省安阳县河干乡富强农业生产合作社根据中共安阳地委的指示，把社员的自留地增加到占当地每人平均耕地面积的5％，得到全体社员的一致拥护。社员们说：这样办，十口人之家能留一亩半地（这个社平均每人三亩地），五分种菜，一亩种粮，搞好了能收到六百斤，喂猪养鸡，生活满可以过好了。
    分配自留地是一件很复杂的工作，社管理委员会召开了社员代表会议，让社员进行充分讨论，根据社员的意见办事，达到了人人满意。
    分配工作遇到的第一个问题，是谁都愿意要近地、好地，不愿要远地、坏地；谁都愿意把增加的自留地跟原有的自留地留到一起。怎么办呢？办法是：把全社该留的自留地的指标，按各队应分的亩数分到生产队，由各队自行讨论具体分配。各队分的时候，尽量照顾各户的自留地都有水利条件（以水井为单位划地分配），各户原有的菜地一般不动，新增加的另行分配。有的社员要求把新增加的和原有的菜地连成一片，那就在收了秋以后由户与户个别调剂。
    分配当中还有一系列的具体问题：
    一，自留地上粮食作物的柴草归谁？大家讨论决定归社员自己。二，今后增减人口是否还增减自留地？决定今后不再变动。三，在外的学生、干部和迁移出去的人口是否留？决定不留，按现有人口分配。四，在外军人是否留？为了照顾军人家属，同时军人服役三年就要回来，决定留。但在外军官不留，转业回来又到外参加了其它工作的不留。五，自留地都是井浇地，水车已成为社内公共财产怎么办？决定由社员无代价使用并负责保管。如有损坏，修理费由社员按自留地亩数均摊。六，自留地增多了，畜力问题如何解决？准备推行牲口“分犋喂养，分散到户，养用合一”的办法加以解决。七，社员在自留地上生产的时间问题如何解决？暂规定执行礼拜制度，让社员七天中有一天时间做自留地上的农活。八，社员对自留地深耕细作，增多肥料，可能影响社内粗肥的使用量，这怎么办？决定开展经常性的积肥工作，加强具体领导，以解决社与社员用肥的矛盾。
    这个社自留地的分配已大体就绪，麦收后社员就可以分够5％的自留地进行种植。
