Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: TASS reports that after a week-long visit to Czechoslovakia at the invitation of the Communist Party and Government of the Soviet Union delegation, Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet delegation left Prague on a Tu-104 jet on July 16th to return home.

Before leaving Prague, Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet delegation went to Old Town Square in Prague to attend a mass farewell rally of 250,000 people. Czechoslovak leaders Sopototsky, Siroky, and Novotny also attended the rally.

First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Novotny, and First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Khrushchev spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Novotny said that the visit of the Soviet Party and Government delegation further consolidated Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship and demonstrated its powerful strength to the world. The security and further peaceful development of our country depend on cooperation with the Soviet Union, with other countries of the powerful socialist system, and with the peace forces of the world.

In his speech, Khrushchev said that as long as the friendship among the countries of the socialist camp continues to grow and develop, there is no need to fear any difficulties or obstacles. He pointed out that our enemies are employing all kinds of conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to undermine the friendship between the peoples of socialist countries. Khrushchev said that it is no accident that the American imperialists spend more than 100 million US dollars every year specifically on subversive activities against the countries of the socialist camp.

Speaking of the economic ties between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, Khrushchev pointed out that these ties are strong, but need to be further expanded so that the work in the industrial and agricultural sectors of the two countries can be better coordinated. He said that doing so can further develop the economies of the two countries and ensure a high standard of living for the residents in the competition with the capitalist world.

Khrushchev also mentioned that the leaders of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia had completely identical views on all political issues during their talks. He said that both countries are in favor of expanding contacts with progressive parties in capitalist countries. He said that we advocate further strengthening relations with Yugoslavia on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, whether it be state relations or party relations.

    布拉格二十五万群众集会欢送苏联嘉宾
    赫鲁晓夫说兄弟国家团结就无所畏惧
    据新华社17日讯  据塔斯社报道，苏联共产党和政府代表团应邀在捷克斯洛伐克访问一个星期以后，7月16日乘“图—一○四”喷气客机离布拉格回国。
    在离开布拉格以前，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和苏联代表团其他人员前往布拉格旧城广场参加了二十五万人的群众欢送大会。捷克斯洛伐克领导人萨波托斯基、西罗基和诺沃提尼等也参加了这次大会。
    捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼、苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。
    诺沃提尼在讲话中说，苏联党和政府代表团的访问，使得捷苏友谊更加巩固，并向全世界显示了这种友谊的充沛力量。我国的安全和进一步的和平发展是依靠同苏联、同强大的社会主义体系各国的合作以及同全世界和平力量的合作来保证的。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中说，只要社会主义阵营各国的友谊不断增进和发展，任何困难和任何障碍都是用不着害怕的。他指出，我们的敌人正在施展各种阴谋诡计，企图破坏社会主义国家人民的友谊。赫鲁晓夫说，美国帝国主义者每年拿出一亿多美元来专门对社会主义阵营国家进行颠复活动，这不是偶然的。
    在谈到捷苏两国的经济联系的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，这种联系是牢固的，但是需要进一步扩大，以便两国工农业方面的工作能够更好地配合起来。他说，这样做可以使两国的经济能够更加发展；并且在和资本主义世界竞赛中，能够保证居民有高度的生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到苏捷两国领导人在会谈中对一切政治问题都具有完全一致的观点。他说，两国都赞成扩大同资本主义国家中的进步政党进行接触。他说，我们主张在马克思列宁主义的基础上进一步加强同南斯拉夫的关系，无论是国家的关系也好，党的关系也好。
