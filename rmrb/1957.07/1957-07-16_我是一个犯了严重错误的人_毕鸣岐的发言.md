I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's and all the leaders' reports.

I am a person who has made serious mistakes. Today, the conference gives me this opportunity to express to all the representatives and the people of the whole country my sincere determination to repent, and I am extremely grateful.

This time, at the symposium of industrial and commercial figures held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, I spread some absurd remarks that violated socialist principles, and echoed Zhang Naiqi, acting as his powerful assistant. When the people of the whole country stood up to counterattack the right-wing elements, I did not seriously examine the root of my mistakes in my mind, and still emphasized that I was proceeding from good intentions and making excuses. At the same time, I tried my best to get rid of my ideological connection with him by criticizing Zhang Naiqi. This dishonest attitude is naturally not understood by the people. After studying Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, and after receiving enthusiastic help from comrades inside and outside the Party recently, I was shocked to realize that my erroneous remarks are not only poisonous weeds that violate the basic principles of socialism and endanger socialist transformation, but have also developed in the direction of being anti-Party and anti-people. If I had not been educated through this struggle against right-wing elements, I would have soon been buried in the reactionary quagmire. I cannot but deeply thank the Party for its education and the comrades for their help.

Below, I will give an account of my preliminary understanding to all the representatives. I will continue to conduct in-depth inspections in the future, and continue to give an account to the Minjian Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations, and the industrial and commercial circles. Limited by my level, the inspection is still far from enough, and I urgently request comrades to give great help to further correct my ideological understanding.

(1) My main erroneous arguments

1. I excessively emphasized the positive side of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, and believed that it was great that the national bourgeoisie could hand over their enterprises with both hands in the whole industry's public-private partnership. Therefore, I took credit for myself, exaggerated the internal causes, and obliterated the more important external cause of the role played by the Party's education and peaceful transformation policy over the past eight years. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie was overestimated. It was considered that this was a leap-over-the-dragon-gate-style breakthrough, which had already changed its nature, and that it could enter socialism without continuing to deepen the transformation. I consciously beautified the national bourgeoisie.

2. Denying the two-sided characteristics of the national bourgeoisie, and denying that class relations still exist. It was wrongly believed that the socialist transformation had been basically completed, so what else needed to be transformed? I did not recognize the essential difference between the national bourgeois elements and the workers in terms of class essence and ideological transformation. Even more erroneous was the belief that the inferiority complex of the national bourgeoisie and the existing contradictions with the working class were caused by dogmatists. It was believed that they did not look at the facts of the progress of the national bourgeoisie, and did not analyze the ideology of the national bourgeoisie in a realistic manner, but stubbornly clung to dogmas. Therefore, it was absurdly said: "The bell must be untied by the one who tied it." This precisely shows my dissatisfaction with the transformation policy, and I wanted to change the policy with my subjective wishes, denying the basic principles of socialist transformation. This not only confused the direction of the transformation of industrialists and businessmen, but also wanted to sell revisionism by opposing dogmatism.

3. Because I emphasized the greatness of the national bourgeoisie and beautified it, I absurdly believed that the national bourgeoisie was almost the same as the working class after the joint venture, and should be "common masters among the masters" "both are masters without guests, both are in the socialist field," and said: "In the vast industrial and commercial circles, Marxist-Leninist sprouts have indeed grown, without which it would be impossible to accept transformation with gongs and drums," and also said: "We also have common feelings with the working class," unwilling to listen to the saying "seeking common ground while reserving differences," and no longer want to keep "transformation" on the lips. These fallacies all reflect my dissatisfaction with the current transformation policy. In essence, it is to demand to stand on an equal footing with the working class, and to be unwilling to continue to deepen the transformation under the leadership of the working class.

From my main and serious erroneous arguments, there is not a single point that is not the same as Zhang Naiqi's argument. Even on the issue of whether fixed interest is exploitation, although I disagreed with Zhang Naiqi's statement in my past speeches, and once affirmed that fixed interest is exploitation, and also criticized Li Kangnian's fallacy of fixed interest for twenty years, I still felt very comfortable with Zhang Naiqi's statement of not working for nothing, and also sympathized with his disagreement with being reborn. The reason why I speak the same language and breathe the same breath as Zhang Naiqi is precisely because I and Zhang Naiqi stand on the same position, have the same ideological system, and represent the reactionary thoughts of the backward side of the bourgeoisie in a concentrated manner, and therefore have become supporters and peddlers of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks.

(2) My ideological roots and preliminary understanding

What kind of thoughts dominated me to flood out these absurd remarks? What was the purpose? After my preliminary inspection, I dug out two main roots of the disease, which are actually one ideological root. First of all, it is because my origin determined the reactionary side of my bourgeoisie, which has taken deep root in my ideology. Although I have made progress in form after eight years of transformation, such as doing some work in implementing the government's policies, laws and decrees and promoting various patriotic movements, as soon as I come into contact with matters related to personal interests, the original reactionary class essence of seeking profit will involuntarily be exposed. Even after the whole industry's joint venture, although the means of production have been handed over, the original reactionary class ideology in my mind is still intact, and has not been well transformed, which will constantly dominate my words and deeds and cause errors. The other, and also the most prominent, is the development of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking essence on the other hand. A strong view of fame and profit dominates me. Not only for personal interests, but also for class interests, I constantly reflect some reactionary thoughts that are unwilling and unconvinced. From a personal point of view, I always want to be outstanding, take the lead, and show myself to satisfy my desire for leadership; from a class point of view, I regard the thoughts representing the backward side of the class as representing the interests of the class. Under the interweaving of these two ideological consciousnesses, my words and deeds have become increasingly arrogant and conceited, so that I have made such serious mistakes in this blooming and contending.

Before the promulgation of the general task of the transition period, my backward ideological consciousness was mainly reflected in economic activities. In the past, I had repeatedly flooded out the essence of profit-seeking in violation of national economic policies, such as panic buying, hoarding, and confrontation with state-owned enterprises. When I was cultivated and educated by the Party and cared for by the government, which enabled me to obtain a certain position politically and socially, I could not wholeheartedly serve the people, but instead fostered a concept of fame and profit, and became more proud, complacent, and arrogant. In my work, I emphasized personal achievements and neglected the leadership of the Party and the enthusiasm of the masses; in the relationship between comrades in the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Minjian Association, the strong view of fame and profit also led to disunity. I always thought that I had strong working ability and could not be inferior to others. For example, when the Tianjin Investment Company and the Demonstration Machine Factory of public-private joint ventures raised private investment, it was originally the industrialists and businessmen who enthusiastically invested in response to the call of the Party and the government, but I thought it was a great achievement of my personal work and took pride in myself; the government solved some problems for the industrialists and businessmen based on the information reflected by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and I also counted these achievements on my own head, thinking that only I could truly represent the interests of the industrialists and businessmen; when the Tianjin Minjian Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce were re-elected, I advocated unification, wanting to serve concurrently as the director of the two associations; I thought that other leaders in the industrial and commercial circles were not as good as me, and even expressed dissatisfaction with the Party's united front work. At that time, I thought that some national bourgeois elements did not seek progress ideologically and were not active in their work, but the Party took care of them. I could not understand it ideologically, and thought that the United Front Work Department was perfunctory to the national bourgeoisie and unwilling to manage it more. I even said at the symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee last year: "Some comrades treat bourgeois elements with bourgeois ideas," and later said in the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee United Front Work Department: "It is condoning evil if the national bourgeois elements who should be criticized are not criticized." Look, to what extent has my reactionary class essence developed? Isn't my view of the Party's united front policy with bourgeois ideas a slander of the Party's policy and a rampant attack on the Party?

The most serious stage of the development of my bourgeois essence of fame and profit was after the joint venture of the whole industry. At that time, I thought that the enterprise had been handed over, which was a merit; on the other hand, I thought that the three rights were gone, and economic activities were impossible. My inherent view of fame and profit shifted to the political aspect, and I always wanted to climb up; at the same time, I thought that I had learned Marxism-Leninism and could also talk a set of theories, especially after the joint venture of the whole industry, I thought that the statement that class contradictions were non-antagonistic had been confirmed, and I was very complacent, thinking that I could also be called a Marxist-Leninist and could stand on an equal footing with the working class; especially after I was appointed as the Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, I thought that this was the Party and the government rewarding me for my merits. My arrogance, self-importance, and personal desire for fame and status became increasingly serious, so I was unwilling to wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the working class and continue to carry out self-transformation. I could not wait to take off the capitalist hat and immediately enter the ranks of the working class, thinking that this was glorious and would not produce a sense of inferiority. Today, looking back, my thought is precisely to gain the right to speak for the leading class after becoming a member of the working class. Combined with my stubborn profit-seeking ideological essence, if this reactionary thought is not transformed and I enter the ranks of the working class with it, the result will inevitably be a sinful act of usurping the leadership of the working class.

Since I wrongly believed that since class contradictions are already non-antagonistic, there should naturally be no more two-sidedness and class relations, I sympathized with those industrialists and businessmen who urgently demanded to take off their hats without analysis, and vainly tried to deny the objective existence of two-sidedness and class relations to solve the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, without seeing the arduousness of the transformation of the national bourgeois elements, and even forgetting that I still had a long bourgeois tail that had not been cut off. My view of problems from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie naturally made me feel that I was representing the legitimate interests of the bourgeoisie. When I encountered the opportunity to let go and contend, I could not help but vent it to my heart's content. In addition, my view of fame and profit became increasingly strong, which made me have such an erroneous thought: thinking that this would further increase my prestige in the industrial and commercial circles and gain more sympathizers and supporters. What is the difference in essence between this and Zhang Naiqi's practice of grasping the weaknesses of industrialists and businessmen and attempting to win political capital by using reactionary fallacies to curry favor with the public?

Since I was enlightened by "we should check the motives from the effect," I was even more shocked and began to realize the serious harm of the mistakes I had made. At present, it is precisely because I have helped Zhang Naiqi sell reactionary bourgeois ideas that many industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin and other cities cannot accept transformation with peace of mind, and hold dissatisfaction with the statement that two-sidedness and class relations still exist, which has seriously affected the relationship between public and private affairs, and has had a profound and negative impact on the process of in-depth transformation of industrialists and businessmen. My reactionary ideology spread from the bourgeois standpoint and viewpoint, no matter what the motives, it will inevitably create resentment against socialism, against the leadership of the working class, and even against the leadership of the Party, and exacerbate the evil consequences of confrontation with the working class. This is a dangerous behavior that leads class relations to become antagonistic again, which is absolutely intolerable.

This struggle against right-wing elements has made me sober under the education of the Party and the enthusiastic help of comrades. If it were not for the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and the unparalleled correctness of the policy of peaceful transformation, the end of our national bourgeoisie would be unimaginable. It has been eight years since the liberation, and we are still allowed to hold fixed interest and given ample opportunities to study and exercise and carry out transformation with peace of mind. This is such a fortunate thing. Specifically to me personally, if it were not under the leadership of the Party, how could I have today's political status and be able to participate in such a solemn people's congress. The Party and the people have given me such generous treatment, but I do not know how to be grateful and repay them, but instead arrogantly spread some reactionary fallacies of bourgeois ideas, which is really disappointing the Party's cultivation and education of me, disappointing Chairman Mao's earnest teachings to me, disappointing the people's trust in me, and disappointing the entrustment of comrades in the industrial and commercial circles to me. I am willing to sincerely confess to the people of the whole country. Today, under the education of the Party, I realize this serious mistake, and I also have the confidence and determination to resolutely correct this mistake, and I am willing to thoroughly carry out self-transformation under the leadership of the working class.

At the time of the joint venture of the whole industry, I, together with comrades in the industrial and commercial circles across the country, made a promise to always listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party. Today I am willing to reiterate this promise once again. Through the inspection of this erroneous thought, I have the confidence and determination to resolutely realize this promise. In the future, I must strengthen learning, strive to transform my thoughts, and make up for the mistakes I have made and the losses brought to the transformation work with practical actions in my work practice. Finally, I would also like to offer a piece of advice to the comrades in the industrial and commercial circles who have been influenced by the reactionary fallacies of me and Zhang Naiqi and other right-wing elements: Only under the leadership of the Party, being loyal, honest, and earnestly continuing to accept transformation in depth, and gradually transforming into a truly self-reliant working people is our greatest interest. Any sweet words that violate this direction are harmful poisons. We must recognize this direction in order to have a bright and happy future.

专栏：

    我是一个犯了严重错误的人
    毕鸣岐的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理和各位首长的报告。
    我是一个犯了严重错误的人。今天，大会给我这个机会使我能够向各位代表、向全国人民表示我真诚悔过的决心，实在感到万分的感激。
    这次我在中共中央统战部召开的工商界人士座谈会上，散布了一些违反社会主义原则的荒谬言论，和章乃器一唱一和，作了他的有力助手。在全国人民站起来对右派分子进行反击的时候，我还没有从思想深处认真地检查自己的错误根源，依然强调是从善意出发，进行辩解。同时，还用批判章乃器的方式来尽力摆脱与他在思想上的联系。这种不老实的态度，自然是得不到人民的谅解的。在我学习了主席的讲演和周总理的报告以及最近期间得到党内外同志的热情帮助以后，才悚然惊醒，认识到我的错误言论不仅是违反社会主义基本原则、危害社会主义改造的毒草，而且已经朝着反党、反人民的方向发展了。如果不是通过这次反右派分子的斗争教育了我，那就会很快地葬身到反动的泥坑里去。这不能不深切地感谢党对我的教育，感谢同志们对我的帮助。
    下面就我初步检查的认识向各位代表作一次交代。以后还准备继续深入检查，并向民建会、工商联组织方面和工商界同志们继续进行交代。只是限于水平，检查得还很不够，迫切要求同志们大力帮助，进一步端正我的思想认识。
    （一）我的主要错误论点
    1．过分强调了中国民族资产阶级的积极一面，认为全行业公私合营，民族资产阶级能够把自己的企业双手交出来是伟大的。因而居功自赏，夸大内因，抹煞了八年来党的教育和和平改造政策所起的作用这一更为重要的外因。因此，就把民族资产阶级估价过高。认为这是鲤鱼跳龙门式的突进，已经变质了，不必再继续深入改造也一样能走入社会主义，有意识地来美化民族资产阶级。
    2．否认民族资产阶级两面性的特点，否认阶级关系依然存在。错误地认为社会主义改造已经基本上完成了，还要改造些什么？没有从阶级本质来认识民族资产阶级分子与工人、在思想改造上有着本质的不同。更错误的是认为民族资产阶级所以有自卑感和与工人阶级之间现存的矛盾，是教条主义者造成的。认为他们不去看民族资产阶级进步的事实，不实事求是地来分析民族资产阶级的思想，硬抱着教条不放。因而荒谬地说：“解铃还须系铃人”。这正表现出我对改造政策的不满，想用我的主观愿望来改变政策，否认了社会主义改造的基本原则。这就不仅迷惑了工商业者改造的前进方向，而且也是想用反教条主义来贩卖修正主义。
    3．由于强调民族资产阶级的伟大而加以美化，所以就荒谬地认为合营后民族资产阶级已经和工人阶级差不多了，应该是“主人中的共同的主人”“同是主人没有客，同在社会主义领域中”，并且说：“在广大工商界确实生长了马列主义萌芽，如果没有这些，就不可能敲锣打鼓接受改造”，又说：“我们和工人阶级也有共同的感情”，不愿再听“求同存异”的说法，不要再把“改造”挂在嘴边上。这些谬论都反映了我对现行的改造政策不服气。实质上，是在要求与工人阶级分庭抗礼、平起平坐，不愿再在工人阶级领导下继续深入改造。
    从我这些主要的、严重的错误论点来看，没有一处不是和章乃器的论调相同的。就是关于定息是否剥削的问题，在我过去发言中尽管不同意章乃器的说法，并曾肯定定息是剥削，同时也批判了李康年定息二十年的谬论，但对章乃器的不劳而获的说法还是感到很舒服，并对他不同意脱胎换骨的说法也有同感。我所以和章乃器同语言、共呼吸，正是由于我和章乃器站在同一个立场上，具有相同的思想体系，集中地代表了资产阶级落后一面的反动思想，因而也就成了章乃器反动言论的支持者和贩卖者。
    （二）我的思想根源和初步认识
    什么思想支配着我泛滥出这些荒谬言论？目的是为了什么？经过我初步检查，挖到了两个主要病根，实际上是一个思想根源。首先是由于我的出身决定了我这资产阶级反动的一面，在我的思想意识上已经深深地扎住了根。虽然经过八年的改造，只是在形式上表现了进步，如在贯彻执行政府的政策法令和推动各项爱国运动中都曾作了一些工作，但是一接触到与个人利益有关的事，原有的那种唯利是图的反动阶级本质就会不自主地暴露出来。一直到全行业合营后，尽管生产资料交出来了，而脑子里原有的反动阶级思想意识仍是原封未动，没有很好地加以改造，这就会不时地支配着自己的言行发生错误。另一个也是最突出的，是资产阶级唯利是图的本质在另一方面的发展，强烈的名利观点在支配着我，不仅为了个人利益，同时也为了阶级利益不时反映出一些不甘心、不服气的反动思想。从个人来说，遇事总想拔尖、抢先、显露自己，来满足自己的领导欲望；从阶级来说，则把代表阶级落后一面的思想认作是代表了阶级利益。在这两种思想意识的交炽下支配着我的言行日趋狂妄自大，以至于在这次鸣放中犯了这样严重的错误。
    在过渡时期总任务公布以前，我这落后一面的思想意识主要反映在经济活动方面，过去曾有数次在违反国家经济政策上泛滥出唯利是图的本质，如抢购、居奇、与国营对抗等。在我受到党的培养教育和政府的关怀照顾，使我在政治上、社会上得到一定的地位时，并不能全心全意地为人民服务，反而滋长了名利观念，更加骄傲自满、自高自大起来。在工作中强调个人成绩，忽视党的领导和群众的积极性；在工商联和民建的同志关系上，也由于名利观点的强烈，形成了不团结的现象，总认为自己工作能力强，不能屈居他人之下。例如公私合营天津投资公司和示范机器厂在募集私股投资时，本来是工商界群众为了响应党和政府的号召踊跃投资，而我则认为是我个人工作的成绩很大，居功自傲；政府根据工商联反映的情况为工商界解决了一些问题，也把这些成绩算在自己头上，认为只有我才能真正代表工商界的利益；在天津民建会和工商联改选的时候，我曾主张一元化，想兼任两会的主任委员；对工商界其他领导层人士则都认为不如我，甚至对党的统战工作也表示不满，当时我曾对某些民族资产阶级分子思想不求进步，工作也不积极，而党反加以照顾，思想上搞不通，认为统战部对于民族资产阶级敷衍了事不愿多管，竟在去年中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上说：“有的同志以资产阶级思想来对待资产阶级分子”，以后又在天津市委统战部说：“对民族资产阶级分子该批评的不批评是姑息养奸”。请看，我这反动的阶级本质已经发展到了如何程度，我这样以资产阶级思想来看党的统战政策岂不是对党的政策的诬蔑和向党猖狂进攻吗？
    我这资产阶级本质的名利观点发展最严重的阶段是在全行业合营以后，当时的思想，一方面认为企业已经交出来了，是有功劳的；一方面认为三权没有了，经济上的活动是不可能了，我这固有的名利观点就转移到政治方面，总想往上爬；同时更认为自己学习了马列主义，也能讲一套，尤其是在全行业合营后，我认为阶级矛盾是非对抗性的说法得到证实，便洋洋自得，认为我也可以称作马列主义者，可以和工人阶级平起平坐；特别是担任了天津市副市长以后，自以为这是党和政府论功行赏，我的狂妄自大、目中无人的骄傲思想和争名誉、争地位的个人欲望更日趋严重，所以就不肯一心一意地接受工人阶级的领导，继续进行自我改造，恨不能一下摘掉资本家帽子，马上进到工人阶级队伍，认为这才光荣，不会产生自卑感了。今天检查起来，我这种思想，正是为了变成工人阶级后就可以取得领导阶级的发言权了。结合到我这顽固的唯利是图的思想本质，如果不把这个反动思想改造过来，而带着它混进工人阶级的队伍中去，结果就必然会造成篡夺工人阶级领导权的罪恶行为。
    由于我错误的认为阶级矛盾既然已经是非对抗性的了，两面性和阶级关系自然不应该再有了，所以对那些迫切要求摘帽子的工商业者不加分析的感到同情，妄想以否认两面性和阶级关系客观存在的事实，来解决民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾，没有从民族资产阶级分子改造的艰巨性来看问题，更忘却了自己还有很长的资产阶级尾巴没有割掉。我这样用资产阶级的立场观点来看问题，自然就会感到我这是代表了资产阶级的正当利益，遇到大放大鸣的机会，就情不自禁地尽情发泄出来，再加上我这名利观点日益强烈，使我产生了这样的错误思想：认为这就会进一步增加我在工商界的威信，获得更多的同情者和支持者。这和章乃器抓住工商业者的弱点企图用反动谬论哗众取宠争取政治资本的作法，在本质上又有什么不同呢？
    自从我得到“应从效果来检查动机”的启发后，更使我大吃一惊，开始认识到自己所犯错误的严重危害性。目前正由于我帮助章乃器贩卖了资产阶级反动思想，使天津市和其他城市的工商业者不少人不能安心接受改造，对于两面性和阶级关系依然存在的说法抱着不满，严重地影响了公私共事关系，使工商业者在深入改造的前进过程中受到深刻的不良影响。我这种以资产阶级立场观点来泛滥反动思想，不管动机如何，它必然会造成反对社会主义、反对工人阶级领导甚至反对党的领导的抵触情绪，加剧与工人阶级对立的恶果，这是引导阶级关系再度走上对抗性的危险行为，这是绝对不容宽恕的。
    这次通过反右派分子的斗争，使我在党的教育和同志们的热情帮助下头脑清醒过来了。如果不是在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和和平改造政策的无比正确，我们民族资产阶级的下场是不堪设想的，解放八年了，还允许我们拿着定息，给我们相当充裕的机会学习锻炼，安心地进行改造，这是何等幸运的事。具体到我个人，如果不是在党的领导下，我焉能有今天的政治地位，那能参与这样庄严的人民代表大会。党和人民给了我这样的优厚待遇，我竟不知感恩报德，反而狂妄地散播一些资产阶级思想的反动谬论，实在是辜负了党对我的培养教育，辜负了毛主席对我的谆谆教导，辜负了人民对我的信任，辜负了工商界同志们对我的委托。我愿意真诚地向全国人民认罪。今天在党的教育下，我认识到这个严重的错误，也有信心和决心坚决改正这个错误，愿意在工人阶级的领导下彻底地进行自我改造。
    在全行业合营时，我和全国工商界同志们一道提出了永远听毛主席的话、跟着共产党走的诺言。今天我愿意再一次重申这个诺言。通过这次错误思想的检查，我有坚决实现这个诺言的信心和决心。今后我一定要加强学习，努力改造思想，在工作实践中以实际行动来补救这次所犯错误和给改造工作中带来的损失。最后，我还愿意向受到我和章乃器等右派分子反动谬论影响的工商界同志们进一忠言，中国民族资产阶级分子只有在党的领导下忠诚老实、认真深入地继续接受改造，逐步改造成为一个真正自食其力的劳动人民，才是我们最大的利益，违反这个方向的任何甜言蜜语都是有害的毒药。我们一定要认清这个方向，才有光明幸福的前途。
