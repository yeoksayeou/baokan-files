A Great Opportunity for Industrialists and Businessmen to Transform Themselves
Joint Speech by Xu Chonglin, Xiao Songli, Tong Shaosheng, and Huang Yumen

We warmly support the reports made by Premier Zhou and others at this meeting, and will strive to implement them.

An Unprecedented Great Victory

During this meeting, we studied and discussed Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government. We gained much enlightenment and were greatly encouraged. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, our people's first Five-Year Plan has become a reality. The total industrial output value of the country has exceeded the target of the last year of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, and our initial foundation for industrialization has been established. In agriculture, the country overcame serious natural disasters last year, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations still nearly completed the Five-Year Plan, with the total grain output even exceeding the Five-Year Plan. The great victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce has fundamentally ended the system of class exploitation that has existed in our country for thousands of years. Our millions of private industrialists and businessmen have embarked on the bright road of socialism and are in the process of transitioning from exploiters to laborers. Taking the industrial and commercial circles in Sichuan as an example, since the high tide, many people have actively participated in socialist competitions and the movement to increase production and practice economy, contributing their wisdom and talents. More and more people have also won the honorary titles of advanced producers and advanced workers. Based on a series of correct measures such as asset verification, personnel arrangements, and economic restructuring, and with the education of the redemption policy among employees and the convening of multiple public-private relations symposiums, the public-private co-working relationship in public-private joint ventures has greatly improved. Now, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen participate in various political theory and professional studies, and strive for self-transformation in the practice of enterprise work, with the help of public leaders and employees. In a country with a population of 600 million, being able to achieve such brilliant achievements in production and construction in just eight years since the founding of the country; especially in the great socialist revolution process of changing the private ownership system of the means of production that has existed for thousands of years into public ownership, without social property being damaged, social order being disrupted, or social production declining, can be said to be unprecedented in human history. All of this undeniably shows that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and by taking the socialist road can the people of our country have today's happy life and a more fulfilling future. Therefore, genuinely supporting the leadership of the Communist Party, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and adhering to the socialist road have become an unshakable fundamental principle in the actual lives of our people.

However, since the Communist Party began the rectification movement, a small handful of bourgeois right-wing elements, careerists, and schemers such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi have used this opportunity to spread a series of absurd and reactionary remarks, with reactionary programs, organizations, plans, and tactics, maliciously carrying out activities to oppose the Party, oppose the working class, and undermine the socialist cause,妄想 attempting to abolish the leadership of the Party and the working class and carry out capitalist restoration in our country. This is absolutely unacceptable to the people of our country. We must thoroughly expose their sinister and ruthless true colors and resolutely fight back against them.

Zhang Naiqi's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Words and Deeds Concentratedly Represent the Negative Side of the Bourgeoisie

In our industrial and commercial circles, Zhang Naiqi is a prominent representative of these right-wing elements who insist on their reactionary stance.

Zhang Naiqi's opposition to the Party and socialism has a long history. In the eight years since liberation, his extremely bourgeois individualistic stance has remained unchanged. As long as there is an opportunity, he vigorously engages in activities and emits his political toxins. On the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, we believe that fixed interest is exploitation, and without the fixed interest system being abolished, industrialists and businessmen are still exploiters. But Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, stubbornly says that fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income, and believes that industrialists and businessmen are no longer exploiters. We believe that advocating a fixed interest for twenty years is making thorough calculations for the bourgeoisie, achieving both fame and profit, and legalizing the long-term existence of capitalism. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, says that this is "excessively pursuing socialism." We believe that the dual nature of the bourgeoisie still exists, and there is an essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, tortuously denies that the bourgeoisie still has a dual nature, stubbornly saying that there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and workers. We believe that bourgeois elements must undergo "thorough transformation" to change from an exploiter into a laborer. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, strongly opposes the "thorough transformation" and refers to all those who advocate that bourgeois elements need to undergo essential transformation as "dogmatists." We say that in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen, we must also help them earnestly carry out self-transformation. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, firmly insists on only "doing everything possible" to mobilize the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen, without mentioning socialist transformation. We say that the socialist system is incomparably superior, but Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, says that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism" to slander the socialist system. Regarding the leadership of the Party and the working class, we are determined to accept the leadership of the Party and the working class, but Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, maliciously distorts Stalin's statement on the quality of Communist Party members, asking the Party to examine "great-Partyism" and not to "come to the forefront." We believe that the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee has correctly implemented the Party Central Committee's political line and has given much help to the democratic parties and industrial and commercial circles in various tasks. But Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, stubbornly says that the United Front Work Department "does not recognize contradictions among the people," negating the political line implemented by the United Front Work Department, which is also the political line of the Party Central Committee. We advocate that in joint ventures, private personnel must obey the leadership of the public. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, says that emphasizing public leadership will make private personnel passive and inferior, making them have positions without power. Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, compares Communist Party members to the political swindler Li Wanming, believing that the Party spirit of the Communist Party is "Parties protecting each other," and the Communist Party is combined by "interests," etc., which is to slander and uglify the Party. But he shamelessly says that he cherishes the Party Central Committee as he cherishes his own eyeballs (!?), which is truly insincere and truly disgusting. All this shows that we are determined to support the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road, but Zhang Naiqi, this right-wing element, is determined to abolish the leadership of the Party and take the capitalist road. Today, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen across the country are celebrating that they have embarked on the bright road of socialism, but Zhang Naiqi wants us industrialists and businessmen to stop moving forward and take the capitalist road back. What are his intentions? Zhang Naiqi must make a thorough explanation.

Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds concentratedly represent the negative side of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking and self-serving exploitation ideology. He is also accustomed to using two-faced tactics, everywhere under the guise of supporting the Party and supporting socialism, using deception, 麻醉narcosis, instigation, and incitement to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Zhang Naiqi is truly a complete two-faced, one-sided (negative side) character. Zhang Naiqi also puts on the stinking airs of the bourgeoisie, with a barbaric attitude. At the Sichuan delegation meeting, he insisted on his reactionary stance and adopted a die-hard attitude, refusing to examine himself, saying: "No amount of examination for three years can reveal anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts," and even openly scolded those who exposed him, truly the most reactionary element among the right-wingers.

Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks still have a market among some backward masses and must be thoroughly crushed

The activities of right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi have a certain market among some backward masses. In our industrial and commercial circles in Sichuan, there are echoes of Zhang Naiqi. For example, Kang Xinru in Chongqing openly defends Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks, stubbornly saying that fixed interest is not exploitation and that we should not emphasize obeying public leadership, especially opposing the essential transformation of industrial and commercial circles, saying that industrialists and businessmen still need to undergo "thorough transformation," which is simply insulting the three generations of ancestors of the industrial and commercial circles, and the industrial and commercial circles can only "become good people in the second generation." Also, Li Zhongping in Chengdu published a series of arrogant anti-Party remarks, and said that the principles of Marx's Capital are not suitable for China's national conditions. We must resolutely overthrow the "dogmatists." We know that the industrial and commercial political schools in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Beijing are all the same. Under the influence of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks, teachers cannot continue to teach. Some students say that they will not listen to "dogmatism" and want to invite Zhang Naiqi to speak. The reason why right-wing elements have a market is that their social foundation is the negative side of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie. However, because our socialist revolution has achieved basic victory and the economic foundation of capitalist society has been basically eliminated, although the capitalist ideas that right-wing elements can use still have a certain market, and this ideological struggle and political struggle will have to go through a relatively long and repeated struggle before it can be overcome, generally speaking, he has no future, this can be affirmed. Of course, our view does not mean that we should not expose and fight back against the toxins and reactionary behavior released by the current right-wing elements, but on the contrary, we must vigorously and thoroughly expose and resolutely crack down on them. Otherwise, it will be very harmful to our socialist cause. In order to safeguard the leadership of the Party and adhere to the socialist road, we must carry the struggle against the right-wingers to the end and thoroughly crush the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements.

In our industrial and commercial circles, a small handful of right-wing elements are adhering to their original reactionary stance. In addition, some people have not undergone good transformation in their original stance, and therefore, in this great blooming and contending to help the Party rectify, some have adopted an attitude of resonance and support for the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements, expressing some erroneous and harmful remarks, and some are wavering and even echoing the erroneous remarks of the right-wingers on certain issues, which in fact has also fueled the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements. We sincerely hope that the right-wing elements can correct their mistakes as soon as possible, thoroughly explain themselves, deeply examine themselves, accept transformation, and take the socialist road. At the same time, we hope that some industrialists and businessmen with unstable and wavering positions will resolutely draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, expose their reactionary conspiracies, and use practical actions to show that they stand on the socialist position and actively participate in the struggle against the right-wing elements. If the right-wing elements repeatedly refuse to be taught and continue to adhere to anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions, then they will be outside the people, and the consequences will be borne by themselves.

The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have called on members of the two associations to wage a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements, and have issued two instructions, which we firmly support and will implement into the grass-roots organizations. At the same time, we are all members of the Democratic National Construction Association and will also implement the Central Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association's rectification instructions, combining rectification with the anti-rightist struggle, and carrying out rectification on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle. In short, the current struggle against the right-wing elements is actually a fierce class struggle between supporting the leadership of the Party and opposing the leadership of the Party, and between adhering to the socialist line and opposing the socialist line. This struggle is a serious test for each of our industrialists and businessmen, and also a great opportunity to transform ourselves and improve ourselves. We are willing to join the industrial and commercial circles across the country to actively participate in the struggle against the right-wing elements, earnestly transform ourselves according to the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, clarify our socialist position, and firmly take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

    工商业者改造自己的大好机会
    徐崇林、萧松立、童少生、黄鱼门的联合发言
    我们热烈地拥护周总理等在这次会议上所作的各项报告，并为其贯彻实现而努力。
    史无先例的伟大胜利
    在这次会议中，我们学习和讨论了毛主席关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲话和周总理关于政府工作的报告，得到许多启示，受到莫大鼓舞。我国人民在共产党的英明正确领导下，第一个五年计划已经变成了现实。全国工业总产值已经提前一年超额完成了五年计划最后一年的指标，我们工业化的初步基础已经建立起来了。全国农业在去年战胜了严重的自然灾害，农业和农副业的总产值仍然接近完成五年计划，粮食总产量还超额完成了五年计划。农业、手工业和私营工商业社会主义改造的伟大胜利，更从根本上结束了我国几千年来的阶级剥削制度。我们几百万私营工商业者已经走上了社会主义的光明大道，正处在从剥削者改造成为一个劳动者的过渡当中。就以我们四川工商界来说，高潮以来，许多人积极参加社会主义竞赛和增产节约运动，贡献自己的智慧和才能，愈来愈多的人还获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣称号。在清产核资、人事安排、经济改组等一系列的正确措施的基础上，在职工当中又进行了赎买政策的教育和召开了多次公私关系座谈会，在公私合营企业中的公私共事关系，已大有改进。现在，绝大多数工商业者参加了各种不同的政治理论和业务学习，并在企业工作的实践中，在公方领导和职工的帮助下，努力自我改造。在我们这样一个六亿人口的国家中，建国才八年，就能在生产建设上取得这样辉煌的成就；特别是在把几千年来的生产资料私有制度变为公有制的社会主义大革命过程里，做到社会财产没有遭到损失，社会秩序没有发生混乱，社会生产没有下降，在人类历史上可以说是无此先例的。这一切，无可辩驳地说明了我国人民只有在中国共产党的领导下，走社会主义的道路，才有今天的幸福生活和更美满的未来。因此真正拥护共产党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，坚持走社会主义的道路，已经成为我们全国人民实际生活中不可动摇的根本原则。
    但是，自从共产党开始整风运动以来，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等一小撮资产阶级右派分子野心家、阴谋家却利用这个机会散布了一系列荒谬反动的言论，有反动纲领、有组织、有计划、有策略恶毒地开展反对党、反对工人阶级和破坏社会主义事业的活动，妄想取消党和工人阶级的领导，在我国进行资本主义复辟。这是我们全国人民绝对不能容许的。我们一定要彻底揭穿他们的阴险凶狠的真面貌，坚决地予以反击。
    章乃器反党反社会主义的言行集中地表现了资产阶级的消极一面
    在我们工商界中，章乃器就是这类右派分子坚持反动立场的突出代表。
    章乃器反党、反社会主义，由来已久。解放八年来，他的极端资产阶级个人主义的立场，原封未动，只要一有机会，他就大肆活动，放射出他的政治毒素。在对工商业的社会主义改造上，我们认为，定息是剥削，定息制度未取消，工商业者仍然是一个剥削者，而章乃器这个右派分子硬说，定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入，认为工商业者已经不是一个剥削者了。我们认为主张定息二十年，是为资产阶级打足了算盘，是名利双收，是使资本主义合法的长期存在。章乃器这个右派分子则说：这是“过急追求社会主义”。我们认为，资产阶级的两面性还存在，资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子有着本质的差别，章乃器这个右派分子转弯抹角地否认资产阶级还有两面性，硬说资产阶级分子和工人没有本质的区别。我们认为，资产阶级分子必须经过“脱胎换骨”的本质改造，才能从一个剥削者改变成为一个劳动者，章乃器这个右派分子则竭力反对“脱胎换骨”的本质改造，并把一切主张资产阶级分子需要经过本质改造的人们，一概称为“教条主义者”。我们说，要充分发挥工商业者的积极性，必须同时帮助他们认真进行自我改造。章乃器这个右派分子则坚决主张只需“千方百计”地发挥工商业者的积极性，而不必提社会主义改造。我们说，社会主义制度无比优越，章乃器这个右派分子则说“官僚主义是比资本主义更为危险的敌人”，来诬蔑社会主义制度。在对党和工人阶级的领导上，我们坚决要接受党和工人阶级的领导，章乃器这个右派分子则恶意歪曲斯大林对于共产党员品质的说法，要党检查“大党主义”，不要“上前台”。我们认为，党委统战部正确地执行了党中央的政治路线，在各项工作上，给了各民主党派、工商界很多帮助，章乃器这个右派分子硬说，统战部“不承认人民内部矛盾”，把统战部执行的政治路线，也就是党中央的政治路线加以否定。我们主张在合营企业里，私方人员必须服从公方的领导，章乃器这个右派分子则说，强调公方领导，就会使私方人员消极自卑，使他们有职无权，章乃器这个右派分子把共产党员比作政治骗子李万铭，认为共产党的党性是“党党相护”，共产党是“利害关系”结合起来的，等等，是诬蔑党，丑化党，而他却厚颜无耻的说，他自己爱护党中央像爱护自己的眼珠一样（！？），真是口是心非，真是肉麻。这一切表明，我们是要坚决拥护党的领导，走社会主义的道路，章乃器这个右派分子却硬要取消党的领导，走资本主义的道路。今天，我们全国绝大多数工商业者正庆幸自己已经走上了社会主义的光明大道，章乃器却要我们工商业者停步不前，走资本主义回头路，这是何居心？章乃器必须彻底交代。
    章乃器反党，反社会主义的言行，集中的表现了资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己的剥削思想的消极一面。他还惯用两面派的手法，处处以拥护党、拥护社会主义为幌子，用欺骗、麻醉、挑拨、煽动的办法来进行反党、反社会主义的活动。章乃器真是一个十足的两面派、一面性（消极的一面）的人物，章乃器还摆出资产阶级的臭架子，态度横蛮，在四川代表小组会上坚持反动立场，采取死硬态度，拒绝检讨说：“再检查三年也检查不出反党、反社会主义思想”，甚至公然谩骂揭发他的人，真是右派中最反动的分子。
    章乃器的反动言论在一部分落后群众中还有市场，必须彻底加以粉碎
    章乃器等右派分子的活动，在一部分落后群众中是有他们的一定市场的。我们四川工商界中，就有章乃器的应声虫。如在重庆的康心如，公开为章乃器的反动言论作辩护，硬说定息不是剥削，不应该强调服从公方领导，特别是反对工商界的本质改造，说，工商业者还要经过“脱胎换骨”的本质改造，简直是侮辱工商界的三代祖宗，工商界就只好“二世变好人”了。还有在成都的李仲平，发表了一系列狂妄的反党言论，并说马克思的资本论的原理不适合中国国情。要坚决打倒“教条主义者”。我们知道，重庆、成都和北京工商界政校一样，在章乃器反动言论的影响下，教员讲课都讲不下去了，一部分学员说，不听“教条主义”，要请章乃器来讲话。右派分子之所以有市场，它的社会基础就是资产阶级两面性的消极一面。但是，由于我国社会主义革命已经取得基本的胜利，资本主义社会的经济基础已基本上被消灭了，虽然右派分子可以利用的资本主义的思想还有一定的市场，而且这个思想斗争和政治斗争，还要经过比较长期反复的斗争才可能被克服，但总的说来，他是没有前途，这是可以肯定的。当然我们这样的看法，并不等于对目前右派分子所放射出来的毒素和反动行为不加以揭露和反击，而是恰恰相反，必须大力的加以彻底揭发和坚决打击。否则对于我们的社会主义事业是有很大危害性的。为了维护党的领导，坚持社会主义道路，我们必须把反对右派的斗争进行到底，把右派分子的猖狂进攻，彻底地加以粉碎。
    我们工商界中，有一小撮右派分子是坚持其原来反动立场。此外还有一部分人由于原来的立场还未获得很好的改造，因而在这次帮助党整风的大鸣大放中，有的对右派分子的反动言论，采取共鸣和支持的态度，发表了一些错误的有害的言论，有的是摇摆不定，甚至在某些问题上附和右派的错误言论，这实际也助长了右派分子的猖狂进攻。我们真诚的期望右派分子能及早的改正自己的错误，彻底交代，深刻检讨，接受改造，走社会主义道路。同时希立场不稳，摇摆不定的一部分工商业者，坚决同右派分子划清界限，揭穿他们的反动阴谋，用实际行动来表示站在社会主义的立场，积极投入反对右派分子的斗争中去。右派分子如果屡教不改，继续坚持反党、反社会主义的言论和行动，那就是自处于人民之外，其后果将由他自己负责。
    中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会号召两会成员向右派分子作坚决的斗争，曾发出两次指示，我们坚决拥护，并要贯彻到基层组织中去，同时我们都是民建的成员，还要贯彻民建中央的整风指示，要将整风和反右派斗争相结合，在反右派斗争的胜利基础上进行整风。总之，当前反对右派的斗争，实际上就是拥护党的领导和反对党的领导，坚持社会主义路线和反对社会主义路线的激烈的阶级斗争。这个斗争，对于我们每个工商业者来说，都是一个严重的考验，也是一个改造自己、提高自己的大好机会。我们愿和全国工商界一道，积极投入反对右派的斗争，根据毛主席指示的六条标准认真地改造自己，明确自己的社会主义立场，在中国共产党的领导下，坚决走社会主义的道路。
