    Zhang Yunchuan Hates Activists and Shields Landlord Bullies

    To the Editor:

    After reading the speech of Mr. Zhang Yunchuan of the China Democratic League Central Committee at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, I felt I had a lot to say. Later, after seeing some people had initially criticized him, I thought, perhaps Mr. Zhang could already recognize his mistakes! But after seeing the so-called self-criticism of Mr. Zhang in your newspaper, I felt I still had to say what I wanted to say.

    Mr. Zhang Yunchuan and I were originally strangers and could not get a full picture of his thoughts to make a comprehensive analysis. But fortunately, in May and June of 1955, when he came to Xiao County, Anhui Province, as a representative of the National People's Congress, I had brief contact with him, so what I say will not be unfounded.

    During his inspection, I and several other comrades felt that Mr. Zhang Yunchuan's hatred for our activists and grassroots cadres was already overflowing, and he was even constantly looking for faults to slander and insult them.

    I clearly remember his attitude towards a village branch secretary. When he went to Datun District, former Pulou Township, for inspection, he asked the village secretary, Comrade Yuan Changwen, whether the grain robbery in Zhuzhuang (in a neighboring township) was caused by the masses being hungry. Yuan Changwen listed the facts to show that it was due to the instigation of counter-revolutionaries. Zhang Yunchuan was not satisfied with the answer and asked if Pulou Township had over-purchased grain during the unified purchase, and why there were so many households short of grain. Secretary Yuan answered truthfully that the grain had not been over-purchased, and the increase in grain-deficient households was because most of the sweet potatoes stored by the masses had spoiled. Zhang Yunchuan first said Yuan Changwen was dishonest, and then, upon hearing Yuan say that the unified purchase and sales in the township had been very successful but also had shortcomings, immediately stood up and sternly rebuked him: "You all say the same thing. You only listen to what's said above, tying up and beating the masses, treating the masses as enemies to complete the task. This is not a victory, nor is it glory. Your method is exactly the Kuomintang style, just like bandits." According to our later understanding, although the unified purchase and sales work in Pulou Township that year had the above-mentioned shortcomings, it was basically done well. There was not a single case of coercion or tying up and beating, and all grain-deficient households were supplied with grain and no one went hungry. I don't know where Mr. Zhang's inexplicable anger came from.

    He also rebuked the district head Guo Xiuzhi in Haoji with equal venom, and in Nanlou Township, he scolded the cadres for "forcing roosters to lay eggs and putting ducks on shelves [forcing them to do the impossible]." There are many similar examples, so I won't list them all.

    Zhang Yunchuan insulted grassroots cadres and activists, saying that they were a volunteer team digging "ditches" and building "walls," separating the Party from the masses. Was he acting out of love for the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the socialist cause, and hating evil like an enemy? I don't think so. If that were the case, Mr. Zhang's own words and actions should have helped to dismantle the "walls," fill in the "ditches," and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses. But in Xiao County, he carried out many activities that incited the relationship between the masses and the Party and the government. For example, he told middle peasants Zhang Hongxing and Han Zhilong that if Shanxi Province was wrong in its unified purchase and sales, it would change, while Anhui was getting worse year after year. A poor peasant in Haoji, Wang Dechang, kindly offered the suggestion that the government should let the agricultural cooperative keep some good seeds and not uniformly allocate them after the unified purchase. Zhang Yunchuan told the peasants on the spot that the government was "taking off its pants to fart, buying in at low prices and selling at high prices" [doing something unnecessary and inefficient] to make more money and make the peasants suffer a great loss.

    Originally, the peasants and grassroots cadres of Xiao County had high hopes for Zhang Yunchuan, believing that he came from Beijing and was a representative of the National People's Congress, and that his socialist consciousness must be very high, and that his inspection would help improve the work. Who knew that even the peasants, after hearing Zhang Yunchuan's words, said: What kind of people's representative is this? How can a people's representative say such destructive things?

    We also wondered if Mr. Zhang Yunchuan was indeed, as he said in his self-criticism, "impatient" and "stubborn," and therefore dissatisfied with everyone and quick to anger with everyone? I don't think so either. During his inspection in Xiao County, he had those he hated and those he was close to. His emotions were expressed very clearly when he met different people. He showed great hatred and unwarranted insults towards our grassroots cadres and activists; but he seemed very close and opportunistic to some landlords, rich peasants, and puppet assemblymen.

    I have no intention of framing Mr. Zhang. I have facts to back it up. Please see, among the thirteen people Mr. Zhang consciously visited in Xiao County, three were landlords, three were former lackeys of landlords and bureaucrats, one was a puppet assemblyman, one was a Kuomintang member, three were backward elements, and three were Communist Party grassroots cadres (two of whom were Yuan Changwen and Guo Xiuzhi, whom he had found and scolded severely). He gifted two wives of landlord Zhang Zuoxi, whom he didn't meet, five yuan each; and left them his mailing address, urging them to write to him if they had any problems in the future. When visiting Wang Xingluan, he inquired about the situation of Liu Ziyu, a former Kuomintang guerrilla commander. When visiting Guo Yongfu, who had been a puppet Bao head, a bandit, and a lackey of Zhang Yunchuan's father, he gave him five yuan. When visiting the bully landlord Zhang Changhan, he expressed sympathy for his suffering under people's control after he complained about it. Even more bizarrely, Zhang Yunchuan also pleaded for four grain robbers, asserting that the grain robbery was caused by the reduction in the grain supply, that the Party and the government should bear the main responsibility, and requested that their executions be reconsidered.

    I think that Zhang Yunchuan's attitude of closeness towards landlords and counter-revolutionaries and his hatred towards activists and grassroots cadres is also related to his family background. During his inspection in Xiao County, Zhang Yunchuan believed that the local government should not have classified his father as a landlord, saying that his father's death was related to the excessive difficulties local cadres had put him through. According to our later understanding, Zhang Fuchen, Zhang Yunchuan's father, had consistently refused to work before liberation, was a local ringleader, had opened an opium den, and had been a long-term opium addict. He was like the kind of bully often seen on stage, riding a donkey all day long, carrying a birdcage, with servants following behind the donkey, going to markets and gatherings, gambling everywhere, and even trafficking women. Zhang Fuchen also often colluded with the government to extort land and property from others, forcing some people into bankruptcy, so the local people called him "Fourth Yama" (Zhang Fuchen ranked fourth among his siblings). During the land reform, Zhang Fuchen alone had sixteen mu of land, part of which was farmed by his children and grandchildren, and part of which was rented out to others. From an economic point of view, Zhang Fuchen lived a parasitic life of exploiting others all his life. From a political point of view, Zhang Fuchen was also a bully who rode on the backs of the people and exploited them. It was entirely correct to classify him as a landlord. Zhang Yunchuan's father's death also had nothing to do with the local government and the masses. During the land reform, the government and the masses educated and controlled Zhang Fuchen, a landlord who spoke and acted wildly and was unwilling to honestly accept reform, but did not go beyond the scope of the law. His death was caused by illness more than a year after the land reform.

    Based on the above circumstances, I believe that Mr. Zhang Yunchuan's vilification of our activists and his slander and insults of our activists are because he stands on a position hostile to the Party and the People's Government, and because his landlord class relatives and friends have been subjected to dictatorial suppression, resulting in a hatred of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the new society. In today's situation, he does not dare to complain about the Party and the government, so he insults the activists to dismantle the pillars and foundation of the Party and the government. I feel that the Party and the government are only acting impartially in dealing with the landlord class relatives and friends of Mr. Zhang Yunchuan, and have not implicated Mr. Zhang in the slightest because of this. If Mr. Zhang holds a grudge because of this, it can only prove that Mr. Zhang's self-reform is too poor and that he is willing to share the same fate as the hostile class. Mr. Zhang Yunchuan should seriously expose and examine his wrong words and deeds.

### 张云川仇恨积极分子包庇地主恶霸

    张云川仇恨积极分子包庇地主恶霸编辑同志：
    在报纸上看到民盟中央张云川先生在中央统战部座谈会的发言，我觉得有很多话要说。后来看到有些人对他已初步进行了批判，我想，或许张先生已经能认识到自己的错误了吧！但看到贵报载张先生的所谓检讨后，我觉得我的话还是要说。
    我和张云川先生本来素昧平生，无法窥透他思想的全貌而作全面的分析，但有幸在1955年5月、6月间他以全国人民代表的身份到安徽省萧县来视察的期间，和他有短暂的接触，因而所讲不至是无的放矢。
    在他视察的过程中，我和其他几个同志就觉得，张云川先生仇恨我们积极分子和基层干部的心情已溢于言表，甚至随时都在寻找岔子来加以诬蔑和进行辱骂。
    我清楚地记得他对一个乡支部书记的态度。他到大屯区原朴楼乡视察时，找乡支书袁长文同志问，朱庄（在邻乡）抢粮是否群众挨饿而起。袁长文列举事实说明是由于反革命分子的煽动。张云川听了不满意，就转问朴楼乡统购买粮是否买过了头，为什么缺粮户多。袁支书依实回答说，粮食没有买过头，缺粮户增多是因为群众家留的山芋大部坏了。张云川听了先说袁长文不老实，后听袁说该乡统购统销成绩很大但也有缺点时，当即站起来厉声责骂：“你们都是这样说。你们光听上面的话，捆绑吊打群众，拿群众当敌人看待来完成任务。这不是胜利，也不是光荣。你们这种作法正是国民党作风，和土匪一样。”据我们事后了解，朴楼乡那年统购统销工作虽有上述缺点，但基本上做得很好，没有发生过一次强迫命令或捆绑吊打的事，缺粮户都得到供应，也没有挨饿的，不知张先生无名火究竟从何而发的？
    他在郝集训斥区长郭秀芝也同样狠毒，在南楼乡骂干部是“打公鸡下蛋、打鸭子上架”。同样的例子很多不必多举。
    张云川辱骂基层干部和积极分子，说他们是挖“沟”打“墙”的义勇队，把党和群众隔离开来。他是否出于爱护共产党、人民政府和社会主义事业而嫉恶如仇呢？我看不是的。如果是那样，张先生自己的言行就应该有助于拆“墙”填“沟”和密切党与群众关系，但他在萧县却进行了不少挑拨群众和党与政府的关系的活动。譬如说，他和中农张宏兴、韩至龙说山西省统购统销错了就改，而安徽反一年不如一年。郝集贫农王德昌好意提意见希望政府让农业社留些良种，不要统购后再统一调配，而张云川却当场对农民说，政府是脱裤子放屁，低价收进，高价卖出，是为了多赚几个钱，而使农民吃大亏。
    本来萧县的农民和基层干部对张云川抱很大希望，认为他是从北京来的，又是全国人民代表，社会主义觉悟一定很高，来视察一定能帮助改进工作。那知张云川的那些话，连农民听了也说：这是什么人民代表，难道人民代表能讲这样的破坏话？
    我们也怀疑过，是否张云川先生确实如他检讨中所说的“性情急躁”、“个性偏执”，因而对所有人都不满意，对所有人都好发脾气呢？我看也不是的。他在萧县视察过程中，有仇仇，也有亲亲，感情在遇到不同人时表露得很鲜明。他对我们基层干部和积极分子表现有很大仇恨，而且横加辱骂；可是对一些地主、富农、伪参议员等却表现得很亲近、很投机。
    我并非有意栽诬张先生，而是有事实根据的，请看，张先生在萧县视察时，有意识访问的十三人中，有三个是地主，有三个是过去地主、官僚的狗腿子，有一个是伪参议员，一个是国民党员，有三个是落后分子，有三个是共产党员基层干部（其中两个就是被他找来痛骂的袁长文和郭秀芝）。访问地主张祚喜未遇，就赠给他两个老婆各五块钱；并留了通讯地址，叮嘱她们以后有问题向他那里写信。访问王兴銮时，询问了过去国民党游击司令刘子玉的情况。访问当过伪保长、土匪和张云川父亲狗腿子郭永夫时，赠送五块钱。访问恶霸地主张长汉时，对他诉述受人民管制的苦情表示同情。更奇突的是张云川还为四个抢粮犯请命，武断地说抢粮是因压缩粮食供应面所致，党和政府要负主要责任，要求考虑不予镇压。
    我想，张云川对地主、反革命分子表现的亲亲和对积极分子、基层干部表现的仇仇态度，还和他的家庭出身有关。张云川在萧县视察，曾认为当地政府不应将他父亲划为地主成份，说他父亲之死和地方干部与其过分为难有关。据我们以后了解，张云川父亲张福辰在解放前一贯不事劳动，是当地集主，曾开设过大烟馆，长期吸食鸦片。他就像戏台上常看到的那种恶霸，整日骑着毛驴子，拎着鸟笼儿，驴屁股后面带着家丁赶集赴会，四出赌博，甚至贩卖女人。张福辰还经常勾结官府讹诈别人土地、财物，迫使某些人倾家荡产，因此当地群众称他为“四阎王”（张福辰排行第四）。土地改革时，张福辰一人有地十六亩，一部分由子孙种，一部分出租给别人。从经济上看，张福辰一生过着剥削别人的寄生生活，从政治上看，张福辰又是骑在人民头上鱼肉人民的恶霸分子，将他划为地主成份是完全应该的。关于张云川父亲之死，与当地政府和群众也无关系。土地改革时，政府和群众对乱说乱动、不愿老老实实接受改造的地主张福辰，进行过教育和管制，但并未超越法律范围。而其死又是在土地改革后一年多因病所致。
    根据上述情况，我认为张云川先生丑化我们的积极分子，诬蔑和辱骂我们的积极分子，是因为他站在和党与人民政府敌对的立场，而是由于他地主阶级亲友受到专政压制而对共产党、人民政府和新社会产生的仇恨心理。在今天的情况下，他不敢埋怨党和政府，只好辱骂积极分子，以此来拆除党和政府的支柱和基础。我觉得党和政府对待张云川先生的地主阶级亲友只是秉公行事，并未因此而连累张先生一丝一毫，如果张先生却由此而怀恨在心，那只能证明张先生的自我改造太差，甘愿与敌对阶级同呼吸共命运。张云川先生应当认真地揭露和检查自己的错误言行。
