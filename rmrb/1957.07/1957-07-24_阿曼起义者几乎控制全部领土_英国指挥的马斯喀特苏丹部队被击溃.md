Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: According to British sources in Beirut cited by Agence France-Presse on July 22nd, armed insurgents supporting Ghalib bin Ali, the Imam of Oman, have taken control of almost all Omani territory. They routed the Muscat Sultan's forces, which were commanded by British officers, and captured several local officials.

    According to sources in Bahrain, the insurgents have cut off the highway to the Awdaiba Airport, which is the supply base for the operations of the Oman Oil Development Company, a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company. A British oil exploration team working for the company has also had its normal land communications with Muscat headquarters cut off. The insurgents have taken control of the trade routes between Muscat and the inland Buraimi Oasis, a trading hub between Saudi Arabia and Oman and the adjacent Trucial Oman.

    Meanwhile, Britain is actively deploying forces to suppress the Omani insurgents. A company of the "Cameron Highlanders" of the British army is preparing at the Shayah base in the Persian Gulf, awaiting orders to suppress the uprising in Oman. A British Royal Air Force spokesman in Nicosia, Cyprus, announced on July 22nd that "a small number" of air transport aircraft had been placed under the command of Sinclair, the British military commander in the Arabian Peninsula. He said the aircraft were being transferred to Aden from existing British air transport aircraft stationed in Cyprus and Habbaniyah, Iraq.

    阿曼起义者几乎控制全部领土
    英国指挥的马斯喀特苏丹部队被击溃
    据新华社23日讯　据法新社7月22日援引贝鲁特英国人士的话说，支持阿曼教长加勒布·阿里的武装起义者已经控制了差不多全部阿曼领土。他们击溃了由英国军官指挥的马斯喀特苏丹的军队，并且俘虏了几个当地官员。
    据巴林方面得到的消息说，起义者已经切断了通往奥达伊巴机场的公路，这个机场是伊拉克石油公司的分公司——阿曼石油开发公司的活动的供应基地。目前正在为这个公司进行工作的一支英国石油勘察队，也已经被切断了同马斯喀特总部的正常陆地通讯。起义者已经控制了马斯喀特同内陆布赖米绿洲之间的贸易通道，这是沙特阿拉伯到阿曼和邻近的特鲁西尔阿曼各地的贸易中枢。
    同时英国正在积极部署准备镇压阿曼的起义者。一连“凯麦隆高地人”的英军正在波斯湾沙雅基地上准备着，等待受命去阿曼镇压。塞浦路斯的尼科西亚方面英国皇家空军发言人22日宣布，已经把“少数”空军运输机置于阿拉伯半岛地区的英军司令辛克莱的指挥之下。他说，这些飞机是从塞浦路斯和伊拉克的哈巴尼雅现有的英国空军运输机中调到亚丁去的。
