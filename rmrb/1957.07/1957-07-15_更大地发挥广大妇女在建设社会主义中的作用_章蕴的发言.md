Give Fuller Play to the Role of Women in Socialist Construction
Speech by Zhang Yun

    After reading Chairman Mao's document on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, listening to the reports on government work and financial and economic work made by Premier Zhou and various Vice Premiers, and hearing the speeches full of life experiences and sincere feelings made by many representatives, I feel very excited and recall a series of events. From the old China to the new China, from the founding of the new China to the present, the great historical evolution unfolds in my mind like a comic strip, picture after picture: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, after decades of arduous struggle, bloodshed, sacrifice, and successive efforts, finally achieved the victory of the first revolution and established the People's Republic of China, with the people as the masters of the country. This must be said to be the first great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. After the Chinese people became masters, they took over a dilapidated mess with a poor foundation, low cultural level, low international status, and surrounded by enemies at home and abroad. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people raised their working hands and began to transform this dilapidated mess, establishing a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist industrialized new China. For more than seven years, our Party, in light of China's actual situation and towards the far-reaching socialist goal, has led the people of the whole country in carrying out the "Five Great Movements" and "Three Great Transformations." While achieving the basic victory of the socialist revolution, it has also carried out the first socialist Five-Year Plan, which is about to be completed. Seeing the people's democratic power becoming increasingly consolidated, the motherland's face changing with each passing day, the economy and culture flourishing, the international status rising steadily, the root of poverty being eradicated, and the people beginning to march towards the road of common prosperity. This must be said to be another great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.

    The Broad Masses of Women, Who Were Greatly Discriminated Against in the Old Society, Love the Party and Love Socialism
    Along with the above-mentioned great achievements came the liberation of women, which Chinese women had dreamed of for many years. After two revolutions (the people's democratic revolution and the socialist revolution), not only were Chinese women completely liberated from the shackles of the "political power," "clan power," "male power," and "divine power" of the old society, but also the root cause of oppression of women—the system of class exploitation—was basically eradicated. From then on, the history of oppression, enslavement of women, and women being inferior to others ended, and a new page of equality between men and women began.

    The Communist Party has done such a fundamentally good thing for us Chinese people, saving ourselves. Undoubtedly, the direction of people's hearts will be very clear. Let us think, would the workers and peasants who were oppressed and exploited in the old society not love the Party and socialism? Would intellectuals who could not develop their knowledge and guarantee their future in the old society not love the Party and socialism? Would women, who account for half of the population and were greatly discriminated against in the old society, not love the Party and socialism? Would other patriotic people from other classes not love the Party and socialism? I don't think so. Those who do not love the Party and socialism, and even oppose the Party and socialism, are only a small handful of people who are obsessed with the exploitation system and are "guarding the spirit" for the old social system and state system. These people do not open their eyes to see the true direction of people's hearts. They sit beside the capitalist spiritual tablet, jump up sadly, and are eager to try to take the opportunity to overthrow the Communist Party and curb the advance of socialism. After seeing the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they saw the Hungarian incident and gloated, thinking that the unity and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union had problems. They saw some difficulties in the advance of socialist construction, saw that the Party and the government still had some defects in the implementation of certain policies and in certain links, saw that some Party members and cadres still had problems, shortcomings, and even mistakes of varying degrees in their work and style, and saw that the people were not very accustomed to many specific measures of the socialist planned economy. They secretly rejoiced, thinking that there were problems with the direction of people's hearts towards socialism and our Party, that socialism was full of crises, and that the world was about to be in great chaos. When our Party launched a rectification movement, sincerely inviting non-Party people to help our Party rectify its style, and everyone kindly and actively put forward some sharp criticisms and opinions to our Party, they thought the opportunity had come and the great chaos was about to begin. From then on, this small handful of long-planned rightist elements took action. They started fires everywhere. They incited the masses. They sowed discord between the Party and the masses. They started their propaganda machine. They pretended to represent the interests of the masses, and under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, they openly put forward their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist program. They carried out incitement and instigation to some naive people without political struggle experience, to some people who had not experienced the suffering of the old society, to some people who had not clearly drawn a line between socialism and capitalism in ideology, in society, and in the state system and organization, and to some people who had temporarily lost some personal interests in the revolutionary process or had been slightly injured in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and ideological reform, these class struggles. They wanted to win over those they imagined they could win over to sympathize with and support them, to resonate with them, to fuel their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, to expand their momentum, and to expand their power. Thus, a planned and directed frenzied attack on our Party began. At one time, a small handful of bourgeois rightist elements were so rampant that they blatantly wanted to lead our Party's rectification movement, which aimed at strengthening the Party's leadership and thus better consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and building socialism, to an anti-Party and anti-socialist system movement.

    The Result of the Struggle Against the Rightist Elements Will Inevitably Greatly Consolidate the Socialist System
    The reactionary bourgeois rightist elements did not expect that the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and many progressive people across the country, and even the broad masses of housewives, loved the Party and stood closely with the Party. When the rightist elements created an anti-Party and anti-socialist tense atmosphere, incited people, and exposed their true colors, we saw that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and women were indignant and eager to fight the rightist elements to the end. Many progressive friends also showed the same unbearable mood. After Chairman Mao's document on the correct handling of contradictions among the people was published, the six principles for distinguishing right from wrong were presented to everyone. The six principles are a magic mirror for seeing through demons, which made the people of the whole country more capable of distinguishing right from wrong, loyalty from treachery, and the ability to see through monsters was improved; people who had been temporarily confused by the alarmist talk of the rightist elements gradually woke up and opened their eyes. At the time when the fox tails of the rightist elements were very high and the people's eyes were brighter, the anti-rightist struggle swept across the country, the conspiracies of the rightist elements were exposed, they had nowhere to hide, they were isolated, and they ended up being caught by the people instead of stealing a chicken. Now, the anti-rightist struggle of the people across the country, which was created by the rightist elements themselves, is in full swing and gradually deepening. I believe that this struggle will thoroughly clarify the conspiracies of the rightist elements, make the eyes of the people of the whole country brighter, their vigilance higher, their sense of smell more sensitive, and their ability to distinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood, fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds stronger. The result of this struggle will inevitably be the further consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, the greater unity of the people of the whole country, the closer relationship between the Party and the masses, the greater enthusiasm of the people in building socialism, and the stronger the force for building socialism.

    I also believe that the victory of the anti-rightist elements, coupled with the victory of the rectification movement that our Party will surely achieve, will be a powerful guarantee for the completion of socialism in our country.

    The victory of our Party's rectification movement and the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, which are about to be achieved, will be another great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people in terms of its great significance for the completion of socialist construction. The achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people, one after another, cannot be obliterated by anyone and will always be evergreen.

    The Broad Masses of Women Are Implementing the Party's Guidelines and Policies for Building Socialism
    In recent years, our Party and Chairman Mao have put forward a series of guidelines and policies for building socialism to ensure the completion of socialism. In order to build socialism on a poor foundation, they put forward the long-term policy of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country through diligence and thrift. In order to promote the development of art and the progress of science urgently needed for building socialism, they put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In order to unite the democratic parties for a long time and jointly build socialism, they put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" based on China's specific historical conditions. In order to mobilize all positive factors, unite all those who can be united, and transform negative factors into positive factors as much as possible to serve the building of socialism, they put forward the slogan of overall consideration and appropriate arrangements based on the 600 million population. Moreover, these guidelines and policies have produced good results in implementation. Our women's organizations and the broad masses of women firmly support these wise and correct guidelines and policies of the Party, and we have implemented them in our work in the spirit of these guidelines and policies. In order to implement the Party's guidelines and policies, the Women's Federation has carried out the following regular work among the masses of women.

    The "Five Goods" Work Has Greatly Developed the Enthusiasm of Employees' Families
    First, in order to implement the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's slogan of "developing all positive factors to serve socialist construction," our Women's Federation, in coordination with the trade union, has promoted the "Five Goods" (good arrangement of family life, good unity and mutual assistance in family and neighborhood, good upbringing of children, good encouragement of employees in production, work, and study, and good self-study) work among urban street women and the broad masses of employees' families. This work has greatly improved the awareness of employees' families and housewives, and has developed their positive factors. Due to the in-depth development of this work, it has played a positive role in encouraging employees' enthusiasm for building socialism, improving employees' attendance rate, improving family and neighborhood relations, promoting socialist love, unity, and mutual assistance between families, promoting a diligent and thrifty atmosphere, and improving methods of educating children. Now, thousands of "Five Goods" activists are almost all over the streets and workers' dormitories in cities across the country. The broad masses of employees' families and housewives have deeply realized that achieving "Five Goods" is patriotism, is love for socialism, and is serving socialism. At the time of the convening of the National Employees' Family Representatives Conference, in order to make the content of the "Five Goods" more suitable for the guidelines and policies of building socialism and to embody the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift in the vast families, it was unanimously resolved by all representatives to change the original content of the "Five Goods" to "good housekeeping through diligence and thrift, good unity and mutual assistance, good upbringing of children, good cleanliness and hygiene, and good hard work in study." Now, the Women's Federation in individual places has begun to promote the "Five Goods" to rural women. In order to adapt to the specific situation in rural areas, they put forward the content of the rural "Five Goods": that is, "good diligence, love for the community, patriotism, unity and mutual assistance, good housekeeping through diligence and thrift, good learning of culture and technology, good respect for mother-in-law, love for daughter-in-law, and education of children, and good cleanliness and hygiene." According to the feedback from individual places, the effect of the pilot project is also very good.

    Through Labor Mutual Assistance and Economic Mutual Aid, Many Difficulties of Employees and Their Families Have Been Resolved
    Second, our Women's Federation, in coordination with the trade union, has specifically promoted labor mutual assistance and savings mutual assistance among some employees' families and housewives. No matter who encounters difficulties in labor due to childbirth, illness, weddings, funerals, and daily life, labor mutual assistance is carried out on the principle of voluntariness and on a conscious basis. If there is economic difficulty, loans are borrowed from the savings mutual assistance group to solve it. Due to this work, the spirit of socialist love, unity, and mutual assistance has been promoted, the absenteeism of employees due to housework has been greatly reduced, the suffering of women has also been reduced, many temporary difficulties have been solved, and the enthusiasm of families for savings has also been encouraged.

    Considerable Success Has Been Achieved in Organizing Women to Participate in Agricultural and Sideline Production
    Third, our Women's Federation has universally carried out work among urban and rural women to publicize and mobilize women to participate in agricultural production, sideline production, handicraft industry, and family sideline production. Under the assistance of grassroots women's organizations, many women have organized a variety of sideline productions based on the principle of relying on mountains to eat mountains, relying on water to eat water, taking materials locally, and doing their best. Such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, sheep, growing vegetables, grinding tofu, sewing, weaving, processing for factories... and so on. This work has played a certain role in increasing family income, improving family life, reducing state relief expenditures, and increasing social wealth and market supply.

    Gathering Strength from the Masses, Many Social Services and Social Welfare Undertakings Have Been Held
    Fourth, our Women's Federation, in coordination with the trade union, under the guidance of mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, gathering strength from the masses, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, has advocated and guided women to run many social services and social welfare undertakings. Take the mass street nurseries run by grassroots women's organizations as an example. According to statistics from 97 cities, 2,309 street nurseries have been established. According to a preliminary statistic from 18 cities in one province, there are 4,316 employee dormitory nursery groups organized by the Women's Federation in coordination with the trade union. A total of 285,678 children are admitted to both. If calculated according to an average of 22 children managed by one person (this is the general standard), this undertaking alone has solved the employment problem for more than 12,000 women. At a time when the vast number of female employees need to entrust their children and the state cannot come up with a large amount of funds to set up childcare undertakings, this work is a way to solve the needs of the masses of women and save the government's investment in this undertaking. At the same time, it also plays a certain role in assisting labor employment.

    In his government work report, Premier Zhou called on our social organizations and the broad masses to come up with various methods to expand the scope of employment, assist in solving employment problems, run various social welfare and social service undertakings, and advocate and promote mass mutual assistance and mutual aid methods. Upon inspection, the work of our Women's Federation is basically in line with the spirit of Premier Zhou's call and is also helpful to the Party's guidelines and policies on building socialism. However, we also feel that we have not done enough on these tasks, and as a people's organization, its role has not been fully played. Our Women's Federation will earnestly respond to the call of Premier Zhou and the People's Government, come up with more methods, make more and greater achievements, and better serve socialist construction, serve the masses, and play its due role in overcoming various difficulties in socialist construction.

    更大地发挥广大妇女在建设社会主义中的作用
    章蕴的发言
    读了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的文件，听了周总理和各位副总理所作的有关政府工作和财政、经济工作的报告，又听了许多代表所作的充满着生活体验的真情实感的发言，使我心情振奋，引起了一连串的回忆。从旧中国到新中国，从新中国开国到现在，伟大的历史演变像连环画一样，一幅又一幅地在我的脑子里摆开了：中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过几十年的艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，前仆后继，终于取得了第一个革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，人民作了国家的主人。这不能不说是中国共产党和中国人民的第一个丰功伟绩。中国人民作了主人之后，接上手的是一个底子穷、文化低、国际地位低微、内外敌人环视的破烂摊子。中国人民又在中国共产党的领导下，举起了劳动的双手，着手改造这个破烂摊子，建立繁荣、富强、幸福的社会主义工业化的新中国。七年多来，我们的党针对中国的现实情况，朝着远大的社会主义目标，领导全国人民进行了“五大运动”“三大改造”，在取得社会主义革命基本胜利的同时，还进行了即将完成的第一个社会主义五年建设计划。眼见人民民主政权日趋巩固，祖国面貌月异日新，经济、文化欣欣向荣，国际地位蒸蒸日上，制造贫困的穷根被挖掉了，人民开始向着共同富裕的道路进军。这不能不说是中国共产党和中国人民又一次的丰功伟绩。
    在旧社会倍受歧视的广大妇女热爱党热爱社会主义
    随着上述丰功伟绩一同出现的是中国妇女多少年来梦寐以求的妇女解放。经过两次革命（人民民主革命和社会主义革命），不仅使中国妇女从旧社会的“政权”、“族权”、“男权”、“神权”四条绳索的束缚下完全解放出来了；而且把产生压迫妇女的根源——阶级剥削制度基本上挖掉了。从此，压迫、奴役妇女和妇女低人一等的历史结束了，男女平等的新的史页开始了。
    共产党领导我们中国人民作了这样的从根本上拯救了自己的好事，毫无疑问，人心背向当然会是很分明的。我们想想，在旧社会里，被压迫被剥削的工人、农民会不爱党、不爱社会主义吗？在旧社会里知识得不到发挥、出路得不到保障的知识分子会不爱党、不爱社会主义吗？在旧社会里倍受歧视的占人口半数的妇女会不爱党、不爱社会主义吗？真正有爱国心的其他阶层人士会不爱党、不爱社会主义吗？我想是不会的。不爱党、不爱社会主义乃至于反党、反社会主义的，只不过是一小撮醉心剥削制度、为旧的社会制度和国家制度
  “守灵”的人。这些人不睁开眼睛看看真正的人心向背，他们坐在资本主义灵牌子旁边，伤心地跳起来，跃跃欲试，想趁个什么机会推翻共产党、遏止社会主义的前进。他们看到苏共二十次党代表大会之后，出现了匈牙利事件，就幸灾乐祸，以为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和巩固有了问题。他们看到社会主义建设中的一些前进中的困难，看到党和政府在执行某些政策中在某些环节上还有些缺陷，看到某些党员和干部在工作上、作风上还程度不同地存在着毛病、缺点甚至错误，看到人民群众对社会主义计划经济的许多具体措施还不大习惯，他们就暗自欢喜，以为对社会主义和对我党的人心向背有问题了，社会主义危机四伏，天下将要大乱。到了我们党开展整风运动、诚心诚意请党外人士帮助我党整风，和大家对我们党善意地积极地提出了一些尖锐的批评和意见的时候，如是他们以为机会来了，大乱要开始了。从此他们这一小撮蓄谋已久的右派分子，行动起来了。到处点火了。煽动群众了。挑拨党群关系了。开动他们的宣传机器了。伪装代表群众利益，借口反对教条主义，公开提出他们的反党、反人民、反社会主义的纲领了。他们向一部分幼稚的、没有政治斗争经验的人，向一些没有经过旧社会苦难的人，向一些对社会主义和资本主义，在思想上、在社会、国家的制度和组织上还划不清界线的人，向一些在革命过程中暂时损失了某些个人利益或者是在肃反和思想改造这些阶级斗争中，受过一点误伤的人，进行煽惑和挑拨了。他们想争取他们幻想能够争取的人来同情和支持他们，发出共鸣，为他们进行反党反社会主义推波助浪，壮大声势，扩展力量。如是有指挥、有计划的向我党的猖狂进攻开始了。在一个时候，一小撮资产阶级右派分子已经猖狂到明目张胆地要把我党目的在于加强党的领导，从而更好地巩固人民民主专政、建设社会主义的整风运动，引向反党、反社会主义制度的运动。
    反对右派分子斗争的结果必将大大巩固社会主义制度
    反动的资产阶级右派分子没有料到，全国广大的男女工人、农民、知识分子以及许许多多的进步人士，乃至广大的家庭妇女都是爱党的，是和党紧紧地站在一起的。当右派分子制造反党、反社会主义的紧张空气、煽惑人心、暴露了他们的本来面目的时候，我们看见广大的工人、农民和妇女都愤愤不平，摩拳擦掌，要与右派分子决一胜负。许多进步朋友也同样表现了忍无可忍的心情。当着毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的文件发表后，六条分辨大是大非的原则与大家见面了。那六条原则是透视妖魔的宝镜，这使全国人民分辨是、非、忠、奸的本领更加提高了；由于右派分子的危言耸听而被一时蒙混的人们，也逐渐清醒，擦亮了眼睛。在这个右派分子的狐狸尾巴翘得很高、人民眼睛擦得更亮了的时候，反右派斗争从全国席卷而来，右派分子的奸计被揭穿了，他们无地自容了，孤立了，他们落到个偷鸡不着反被人民捉住了。现在这个右派分子自己制造出来的全国人民反右派的斗争，正在方兴未艾，逐步深入。我相信这个斗争将会把右派分子的阴谋彻底搞清，使全国人民的眼睛更明亮，警惕性更高，嗅觉更灵，分辨是、非、真、伪、香花、毒草的能力更强。这个斗争的结果必然是人民民主专政和社会主义制度更加巩固，全国人民更加团结，党群关系更加亲密，人民建设社会主义的积极性更加提高，建设社会主义的力量更加强大。
    我也相信反右派分子的胜利，再加上我们党必将取得的整风胜利，将成为我国建成社会主义的有力保证。
    行将取得的我党的整风胜利和反右派斗争的胜利，就它对完成社会主义建设的重大意义来说，将是中国共产党和中国人民的再一次的丰功伟绩。中国共产党领导中国人民建树起来的一个接着一个的丰功伟绩，是任何人也抹煞不了的，也是永远常青的。
    广大妇女正在贯彻执行党建设社会主义的方针政策
    近年来我们的党和毛主席为保证建成社会主义，又提出了一连串的建设社会主义的方针政策。为了要在底子穷的基础上建成社会主义，提出了增产节约、勤俭建国的长远方针。为了促进建设社会主义迫切需要的艺术发展和科学进步，提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。为了长期团结各民主党派，共同建设社会主义，从中国的具体的历史条件出发，提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针。为了调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义服务，又提出了从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排的口号。并且，这些方针政策，已经在贯彻执行中产生了良好的效果。我们妇女团体和广大妇女群众，是坚决拥护党的这些英明正确的方针政策的，我们已经本着这些方针政策的精神，在自己的工作中贯彻执行。妇联为了贯彻执行党的方针政策，在妇女群众中进行了下面一些经常工作。
    “五好”工作大大发挥了职工家属的积极性
    第一，为了贯彻党中央和毛主席关于“发挥一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务”的口号，我们妇联与工会配合一起在城市街道妇女和广大职工家属中，推行了“五好”（家庭生活安排好，家庭邻里团结互助好，教养子女好，鼓励职工生产、工作、学习好，自己学习好）工作。这一工作大大提高了职工家属和家庭妇女的觉悟，发挥了她们的积极因素。由于这一工作的深入开展，对鼓舞职工建设社会主义的积极性，提高职工出勤率，改善家庭邻里的关系，推动家属与家属之间的社会主义友爱、团结、互助，促进勤劳节约的风气，改进教育子女的方法，都起了积极的作用。现在成千累万的“五好”积极分子，差不多遍布在全国各城市的各个街道和工人宿舍中。广大职工家属和家庭妇女已经深刻体会到做到“五好”，就是爱国，就是爱社会主义，就是为社会主义服务。在全国职工家属代表会议召开的时候，为使
  “五好”内容更加适合建设社会主义的方针政策，使勤俭建国的方针体现于广大家庭，经全体代表一致决议，将原来的“五好”内容改为“勤俭持家好，团结互助好，教养儿女好，清洁卫生好，努力学习好”。现在个别地方的妇联已开始将“五好”推向农村妇女群众中去。她们为了适应农村的具体情况，提出了农村“五好”的内容：即“勤劳、爱社、爱国、团结互助好，勤俭持家好，学习文化技术好，尊婆、爱媳、教育子女好，清洁卫生好”。据个别地方的反映，试点的效果也很好。
    通过劳力互助和经济互济的办法，解决了职工和家属许多困难
    第二，我们妇联和工会配合一起，在部分职工家属和家庭妇女群众中，具体地推行了劳动互助和储金互助。不论谁家遇到生育、生病、婚丧大事和日常生活上的劳力困难时，就在自愿的原则下和自觉的基础上，实行劳力互助。如果是经济困难，就向储金互助组借贷解决。由于这个工作，发扬了社会主义友爱、团结、互助的精神，大大减少了职工因家务事的缺勤，也减少了妇女的痛苦，解决了许多临时困难，还鼓励了家属对储蓄的积极性。
    组织妇女参加农副业生产已有相当成效
    第三，我们妇联在城乡妇女群众中普遍进行了宣传发动妇女参加农业生产、副业生产、手工业、家庭副业生产的工作。许多妇女在基层妇女组织的帮助下，根据靠山吃山、靠水吃水、就地取材、各尽所能的原则，组织了多种多样的副业生产。如养猪、鸡、鸭、羊、种菜，磨豆腐，缝纫，编织，为工厂加工……等等。这个工作对增加家庭收入，改善家庭生活，减少国家的救济开支，增加社会财富和市场供应，都发生了一定的作用。
    群策群力，举办了许多社会服务和社会福利事业
    第四，我们妇联和工会配合一起，在发动群众又依靠群众，群策群力和勤俭办一切事业的方针下，倡导和辅导妇女群众举办了许多社会服务和社会福利事业。就拿妇联基层组织举办的群众性的街道托儿站来说，就九十七个城市的统计，已建立街道托儿站二千三百零九个。妇联组织与工会配合辅导职工家属组织起来的职工宿舍托儿组，据一个省十八个市的初步统计，就有四千三百一十六个。两下共收托儿童二十八万五千六百七十八名。如果按照平均一个人管理二十二个孩子计算（这是一般标准），仅就这一事业就解决了一万二千多个妇女的就业问题。在目前广大女职工需要寄托孩子而国家又还不能拿出大批的经费来兴办托儿事业的时候，这个工作是既能解决妇女群众的要求，又能节省政府对这一事业的投资的办法。同时对辅助劳动就业也有一定的作用。
    周总理在政府工作报告中号召我们社会团体和广大群众自己想出各种办法，扩大就业范围，协助解决就业问题，举办各种社会福利和社会服务事业，提倡和推广群众性的互助互济办法。检查起来，我们妇联的工作基本上是符合周总理号召的精神的，也是有助于党关于建设社会主义的方针政策的。但是我们也感到我们对这些工作，还做得很不够，作为一个人民团体，它的作用也还发挥得很不够。我们妇联将认真地响应周总理和人民政府的号召，想出更多的办法，作出更多更大的成绩，更好地为社会主义建设服务，为群众服务，为克服社会主义建设中的各种困难发挥应有的作用。
