Who Says the Literary and Art Circles Are a Complete Mess?
Zhejiang Literary and Art Circles Refute Chen Xuechao

(Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch) The literary and art circles of Zhejiang Province held symposiums on July 14th and 26th, exposing and refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of writer Chen Xuechao.

At the first symposium of literary and art circles in Zhejiang Province on April 31st, Chen Xuechao described the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China as a "lid" on the literary and art circles, "making people feel suffocated." In the "Interview with Chen Xuechao" written by a reporter from Wenhui Bao on May 18th, Chen Xuechao completely dismissed the achievements of the Party in literary and art work, and described the literary and art circles of Zhejiang led by the Party as a complete mess. She portrayed the leaders of the Provincial Committee as autocratic demons. She also said that the Provincial Committee created "artificial contradictions, resulting in centrifugal tendencies."

Chen Xuechao not only described the literary and art circles of Zhejiang as a complete mess, but also uglified the entire new society. In her article "More Realistically...", Chen Xuechao exaggerated individual phenomena such as falsely reporting achievements and submitting false reports as "commonplace" things in the new society, saying that "such deception, lying, and falsehood have not only invaded work and interpersonal relationships, but even daily life." She said that she was "often subjected to deception and lying," "and all from leaders." These reactionary fallacies were unanimously denounced by everyone at the symposium.

At the symposium on the 26th, Chen Xuechao made a self-criticism, admitting that her remarks were thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist, and expressed her willingness to study hard in the future and thoroughly transform herself.

### 谁说文艺界是一团漆黑  浙江文艺界驳斥陈学昭

    谁说文艺界是一团漆黑
    浙江文艺界驳斥陈学昭
    本报讯　浙江省文艺界在7月14日和26日举行座谈会，揭露和驳斥了作家陈学昭的反党反社会主义言论。
    陈学昭在4月31日浙江省第一次文艺界座谈会上把中共浙江省委说成是文艺界头上的一个“盖子”，“闷得人透不过气来”。在5月18日文汇报记者所写的“陈学昭访问记”中，陈学昭把党在文艺工作上的成绩一笔抹煞，把党所领导的浙江文艺界说成一团漆黑。把省委领导形容得像专制魔王一般。还说省委制造“人为的矛盾，以致造成离心离德”。
    陈学昭不但把浙江文艺界说得一团漆黑，而且把整个新社会也加以丑化。陈学昭在一篇“更真实些……”这篇文章中，把虚报成绩、打假报告等个别现象夸大为新社会“习以为常”的东西，说“这种欺诈、说谎、虚假的东西，不仅侵入到工作中，人与人的交往中，甚至侵入到日常的生活中来了”。她说她就“经常受到欺诈和说谎”，“而且都出之于领导者”。这些反动谬论在座谈会上受到大家的一致痛斥。
    在26日的座谈会上，陈学昭作了检讨，承认自己的言论是彻头彻尾反党反社会主义的，并表示愿意今后好好学习，彻底改造自己。
