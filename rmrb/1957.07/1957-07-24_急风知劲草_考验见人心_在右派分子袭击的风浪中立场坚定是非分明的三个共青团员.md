Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 23rd: In the past two months, some students at Shanghai universities, which were attacked by rightists, lost their way for a time, but some students withstood the test of this turbulent wave and maintained a correct position. At a meeting of Communist Youth League members from Shanghai universities held on the 21st, three Communist Youth League members—Chen Xiyue from East China Normal University, Hu Wenwei from Shanghai Fisheries College, and Wu Meiyi from East China Textile Engineering Institute—spoke freely about their experiences in participating in the anti-rightist struggle.

	Uphold Principles, Persuade with Reason
	--Chen Xiyue from East China Normal University
	One day, Chen Xiyue, who was organizing his notebook in class, looked up and saw a letter challenging him on the blackboard. The gist was: You say Xu Jie's remarks are anti-socialist, we disagree, and we want to debate with you, requiring you to answer immediately. The challenger was Zhao Xingrong, a first-year student in the Chinese Department.
	Chen Xiyue wrote several large characters on the blackboard without hesitation: "Agree to debate." Before this, Chen Xiyue had already had different opinions with some classmates, and had argued several times. Once, Chen Xiyue said at the dinner table: "Is this how things should be done? Do you really want to learn from the Hungarian university students?" This one sentence was immediately besieged by classmates at the table. One classmate slapped the table with his chopsticks: "Everyone has freedom of speech, especially during the blooming period!" "Even counter-revolutionaries have freedom of speech, please do not hinder blooming!" Another immediately chimed in. Chen Xiyue immediately retorted: "Counter-revolutionaries do not have freedom of speech." During these days, Chen Xiyue was really distressed, and told his close friend: "The Party is really like my own mother. These days, it's like my mother has been beaten, and I feel pain..."
	It was at this time that Chang Xiping, the secretary of the school's Party committee, and some responsible persons of democratic parties pointed out a series of reactionary words and deeds by Xu Jie, who was wearing the cloak of a "progressive writer," to undermine the rectification movement. Chen Xiyue carefully studied Xu Jie's words and deeds in the rectification movement, combined with the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement, repeatedly thought about it, and immediately posted a big-character poster refuting Zhao Xingrong. In this way, the two sides fought for two weeks. Finally, Zhao Xingrong issued a challenge to Chen Xiyue requesting a debate. In order to have sufficient factual basis for the debate, Chen Xiyue invited Zhao Xingrong to visit Liu Xieren, the head of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang at the Normal University, and Cheng Junying, a member of the China Democratic League. Zhao Xingrong said to Chen Xiyue: "I understand, let's not visit the teachers anymore." It turned out that the facts stated by the two teachers had made Zhao Xingrong give up his mistaken views.
	"Why can Chen Xiyue believe in the Party so firmly?" Zhao Xingrong couldn't figure it out for a while.
	Chen Xiyue said to Zhao Xingrong: "I planted the seeds of class hatred when I was five years old. At that time, my family only had two mu of land. One day, the landlord's goose came to eat the beans in our field. My father drove the goose away and was brutally beaten by the landlord until his skin was broken. My uncle cried angrily. When the landlord's geese came to steal beans again, my uncle stabbed the goose. When the landlord found out, he poked my uncle nine times with an iron awl and cut off his tongue. My uncle died unjustly." Chen Xiyue also said that he was forced to watch the tragic scene of burying revolutionary cadres alive. Soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, chairwomen of the women's association, and leaders of the children's corps were thrown into the pit one after another. He said: "I hate these beasts!"
	Chen Xiyue said: In my childhood life, I didn't go to school until I was nine years old. My family was so poor that I couldn't even wear cotton pants or a cotton quilt. Later, when I was studying in elementary school, others went home for lunch after school, but I secretly ran to the fields to dig wild vegetables to eat. After liberation, I was admitted to Peixian Middle School. Today, I have entered university and am enjoying the people's student grant. Tell me, who should I believe if I don't believe in the Party?
	The pre-arranged debate time arrived. Classroom 201 in the Literature and History Building was filled with teachers and students. They looked anxiously out the window and saw Chen Xiyue and Zhao Xingrong walking hand in hand from afar.
	Zhao Xingrong stepped into the classroom and wrote several large characters on the blackboard: "Today's debate will not be held. I was wrong."

	Stand Firm, Uphold the Truth
	--Hu Wenwei from Shanghai Fisheries College
	On the evening of June 14th, the library of Shanghai Fisheries College was filled with students preparing for exams. Suddenly, the lights were turned off, and only a shout was heard: "Students! Now is not the time to study, it is the time for everyone to take action!"
	Immediately afterwards, bells and drums rang everywhere on campus, one more urgent than the other, shaking people's hearts.
	The students walked out of the dormitories and libraries in confusion and flocked to the large dining hall, where it was said that the "student union" was holding a school-wide student meeting.
	"Students, you are finally disappointed! Minister Yang did not receive us... All of our students must immediately go to the Higher Education Bureau to petition!"
	Standing in the crowd, Hu Wenwei, like most students, listened for a long time before he understood that some "representatives" from the school had gone to see Yang Xiufeng, the minister of the Higher Education Department, that afternoon, asking for a reply to the issue of building a swimming pool, etc. Now these "representatives" were holding a meeting to convey the process of going to the Higher Education Bureau. Listening to this, Hu Wenwei felt that the "representative's" remarks were inflammatory and not right.
	Some students with ulterior motives took to the stage one after another to make some inflammatory remarks: "Minister Yang's failure to come is bureaucracy!" "Students! We must strike and stop the exams, and then go to the streets to petition!" Finally, the deputy secretary of the Party committee took the stage. He said that the Party committee had always supported the reasonable opinions of the masses. For the problems among the people, a correct attitude should be adopted, rather than making a big democratic fuss. His speech was constantly "booed." Hu Wenwei remembered that as a Communist Youth League member, he should think independently, stand firm, and distinguish right from wrong in the face of sharp class struggle. Finally, he raised his head and rushed to the stage, awakening most of the League members and students, and shattering the rightists' conspiracy.
	After the meeting, Hu Wenwei returned to the dormitory, only to hear the students in the room shouting: "Hu Wenwei is a flatterer!" "Hu Wenwei is a spear carrier!" "Hu Wenwei, if you admit your mistake now, the classmates in the class will still trust you in the future!"
	But Hu Wenwei did not waver. He explained to his classmates with a smile: "I cannot agree with your views, let's argue later!" At this time, the Youth League Committee convened a Youth League branch meeting to discuss how League members should correctly deal with this issue. At the meeting, some League members expressed their opposition to Hu Wenwei's views, saying that Hu Wenwei was detached from the masses and wanted him to make a self-criticism. Hu Wenwei stood up and said solemnly: "Even if you discriminate against me, scold me, I will never give up my correct opinions in order to gain the temporary trust and applause of some people." Many students in the school did not have a correct understanding of this issue, and there were still constant insults. Hu Wenwei and several students wrote an article entitled "Adhere to Principles, Distinguish Right from Wrong." When the manuscript was broadcast on the radio station, it was immediately countered by several students in the fourth grade, who嚣张地要 Hu Wenwei in "应战" on a certain day of a certain month. But this "challenge" did not take place, because Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published, and the students improved their understanding, recognized right from wrong, and took the initiative to request that the debate not be held.

	Distinguish Right from Wrong, Smash the Vicious Plot
	--Wu Meiyi from East China Textile Engineering Institute
	Wu Meiyi had been reported during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaign. A cadre named Liang, who worked on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries (a Party member), was also relatively rude to him. Later, after careful investigation and research by the Party committee, it was clarified that Wu Meiyi had only participated in the Kuomintang army for three days and had also participated in a backward small group, with no other problems. The comrades of the Party committee personally apologized to him several times and restored his League membership, which gave Wu Meiyi spiritual comfort.
	However, a classmate in the class, under the instigation of a rightist from the first grade of the Dyeing and Chemical Department, suddenly posted a big-character poster on June 7 entitled "Accusing Liang of Crimes to the Party," demanding that Liang be expelled from the Party and the school. Then a cartoon uglifying Liang was posted, and a wave of opposition to Liang swept through the school.
	Insidious rightists and a few students also secretly inquired of the rightist Xia Gaoyang about how to make a fuss over Liang's problem. Xia Gaoyang insidiously incited them, saying: "If this problem is not made public, it is a problem of internal contradictions; if it is made public, it can be resolved in court!" This idea hit their hearts, so they immediately prepared a condemnation meeting in secret, euphemistically called a "debate," and also invited comrades from the Procuratorate to the venue, attempting to use Wu Meiyi's speech at the meeting to send Liang to the court.
	But Wu Meiyi did not lose his way. The representatives of most of the students in the cotton spinning (35) class (Wu Meiyi's class) spoke first, "Expressing satisfaction with the Party committee's handling. The rightist from the first grade of the Dyeing and Chemical Department then took the stage and said: "Liang's rude behavior is a crime and should be handed over to the court..." But more and more teachers and students expressed their disagreement with the rightist's views. This rightist deliberately concealed his unease, saying that he did not understand the actual situation, while he also contradicted himself by saying that he did not insist on sending Liang to court. At this time, the chairman read out Wu Meiyi's written statement: "Classmates, I thank you for your concern and support. Liang's mistakes have caused me pain, but I have figured it out. In this way, some people may say that I don't have the qualities of a human being. No! I have qualities. I think my qualities should be to adopt an attitude of curing diseases and saving people, starting from the desire for unity, to help the Party rectify its work and help Party members correct their mistakes. If a Party member's illness is cured, I am happy, and my qualities will be truly tested. Liang has apologized to me and has faced the facts and admitted his mistakes. I think she has made progress. Classmates! Her progress has made me forget the past pain. I am happy, I am relaxed, and I and she are united again on a new basis. In the torrent of building socialism, we can work together..."
	The rightists' conspiracy to use the Wu Meiyi incident as an attack on the Party, which lasted less than five days, was thus completely shattered.

    急风知劲草　考验见人心
    在右派分子袭击的风浪中立场坚定是非分明的三个共青团员
    新华社上海23日电　最近两个月中，遭受右派分子袭击的上海高等学校，有些学生一度迷失了方向，但是有些学生却接受了这场惊涛骇浪的考验，坚持了正确的立场。在21日上海高等学校共青团员举行的集会上，有三个共青团员——华东师范大学陈锡岳、上海水产学院胡文伟、华东纺织工学院吴美义畅谈了他们自己参加反右派斗争的经历。
    坚持原则　以理服人
    ——华东师范大学的陈锡岳
    一天，正在课堂上整理笔记本的陈锡岳抬头一看，黑板上出现了一封向他挑战的信。大意说：你说许杰的言论是反社会主义的，我们不同意，愿与你辩论，要求你立刻答复。挑战者是中文系一年级学生赵兴荣。
    陈锡岳毫不迟疑地在黑板上写了几个大字：“赞成辩论”。在这以前，陈锡岳早就和有些同学有不同的意见了，已经争吵了好几次。一次陈锡岳在饭桌上说：“这样搞下去，还像话吗？难道真要学匈牙利的大学生吗？”就这么一句话，立即遭到了饭桌上同学的围攻。一个同学用筷子拍着桌子：“任何人都有言论自由，特别在鸣放时期！”“对反革命分子也有言论自由，请你不要妨碍鸣放！”旁边一个立即帮腔。陈锡岳也立即反驳：“反革命分子没有言论自由”。在这样的日子里，陈锡岳真是苦恼极了，曾向他的知心朋友说：“党真像是自己的母亲一样。这几天，好像我母亲挨了打一样，我感到疼痛……”。
    正是这时，学校的党委书记常溪萍和有些民主党派负责人指出了披着“进步作家”外衣的许杰一系列的破坏整风运动的反动言行。陈锡岳仔细地研究了许杰在整风运动中的言行，再结合党中央关于整风运动的指示，反复思考，立刻贴出了反驳赵兴荣的大字报。就这样一来一去，双方斗争了两个星期。最后赵兴荣终于向陈锡岳发出了要求辩论的挑战书。为着辩论时拿出充分的事实根据，陈锡岳约了赵兴荣先后访问了民革师大负责人刘侠任和民盟盟员程俊英。赵兴荣对陈锡岳说：“我明白了，我们不要再去访问老师了。”原来两位教师所讲的事实，已经使赵兴荣放弃了自己的错误看法。
    “为什么陈锡岳能这样坚定地相信党呢？”赵兴荣一时还想不通。
    陈锡岳对赵兴荣说：“我在五岁的时候就埋下了阶级仇恨的种子。那时，我家只有二亩地。一天地主家的鹅来吃我们田里的豆子，我父亲把鹅赶走了，被地主毒打得皮破肉烂。我的伯父气哭了，当地主的鹅群又来偷吃豆子时，我的伯父就把鹅扎了一下，地主知道了，竟用铁锥把我的伯父戳了九下，还割下了舌头，伯父就这样含冤死了。”陈锡岳还说他被逼着看过活埋革命干部的惨景，八路军战士、妇女会会长、儿童团团长，一个又一个地被扔到了坑里。他说：“我恨这些野兽！”
    陈锡岳说：我的幼年生活，九岁还没入学，家里穷得连棉裤也穿不上，棉被也盖不上。后来我在小学念书，别人放学回家吃午饭，我却偷偷地跑到田里去挖野菜吃。解放了，我考进了沛县中学。今天又进了大学，享受着人民助学金。你说，叫我不相信党，又相信谁？
    预先约定的辩论时间来到了，文史楼201教室里坐满了师生，他们焦急地望着窗外，看见陈锡岳、赵兴荣挽着手远远地走过来了。
    赵兴荣跨进了教室，就在黑板上写了几个大字：“今天辩论会不开了。我错了。”
    站稳立场　维护真理
    ——上海水产学院的胡文伟
    6月14日的傍晚，上海水产学院图书馆里坐满了准备考试的同学。突然，电灯被熄灭了，只听见一阵喊叫：“同学们！现在不是学习的时候了，是大家行动起来的时候了！”
    紧接着，校园里到处响起了钟声和鼓声，一阵紧似一阵，震得人们的心动荡不定。
    同学们迷茫地从宿舍、图书馆里走出来，涌向大饭厅，据说是“学生会”召开全校学生大会。
    “同学们，你们终于失望了！杨部长没有接见我们……我们全体学生要马上到高教局请愿去！”
    站在人群里的胡文伟，和大多数同学一样，听了很久才明白原来当天下午学校里一些“代表”去见高教部部长杨秀峰，要求对造游泳池等问题作出答复，现在这些“代表”召开会议传达去高教局的经过。胡文伟听着，感到这个“代表”的言论有煽动性，不大对头。
    一些别有用心的学生一个接着一个，上台发出一些煽动性的言论：“杨部长不来是官僚主义！”“同学们！我们要罢课、停考，再到街上去请愿！”终于党委副书记上台了，他表示党委从来是支持群众的合理的意见的，对于人民内部的问题应该采取正确态度，而不是闹大民主。他的讲话不断地受到了“嘘”声，胡文伟想起了作为一个共青团员，在尖锐的阶级斗争中，应该独立思考，站稳立场，明辨是非，终于昂着头冲上了台，唤醒了大多数团员和同学，把右派分子的阴谋粉碎了。
    会后，胡文伟回到宿舍，只听见寝室里同学嚷着：“胡文伟拍马屁！”“胡文伟是跑龙套！”“胡文伟，现在你就承认错误，以后班上同学还是会信任你的！”
    但是胡文伟没有动摇，他笑嘻嘻地向同学解释说：“我不能同意你们的看法，以后再争论吧！”这时，团委召开了团支部大会，讨论团员应如何正确对待这个问题。会上有些团员表示反对胡文伟的看法，并且说胡文伟脱离群众，要他检讨。胡文伟站起来严正地说：“即使你们歧视我也好，骂我也好，但我决不为了获得某些人一时的信任和鼓掌，而放弃自己正确的意见。”校内不少同学对这个问题还没有正确的认识，谩骂声还是不断出现。胡文伟和几个同学写了一篇题为“坚持原则、明辨是非”的稿件。当稿件在广播台传出后，马上遭到四年级几个学生的反击，并且嚣张地要胡文伟在某月某日“应战”。但是这次应战并没有进行，因为毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲演发表了，同学们提高了觉悟，认清了是非，主动要求不开辩论会了。
    明辨是非　粉碎毒计
    ——华东纺织工学院的吴美义
    吴美义在肃反运动中曾被人检举过，肃反工作的干部梁某某（党员）对他也比较粗暴。后来党委经过认真调查研究，查清了吴美义只参加了国民党军队三天，还参加了一个落后的小集团，没有其他问题。党委同志几次亲自向他道歉，恢复了他的团籍，使吴美义精神上得到了安慰。
    可是班里一个同学在染化系一年级的右派分子指使下，突然在6月7日贴出了一张“向党控诉梁某某罪行”的大字报，要求开除梁的党籍、学籍。接着一张丑化梁某某的漫画又贴出来了，于是学校里掀起了反对梁某某的风波。
    无孔不入的右派分子和少数同学还偷偷地去询问右派分子夏高阳，梁某某的问题应该怎样闹法。夏高阳阴险地煽动他们说：“这问题不闹出去是内部矛盾问题；闹出去可以到法院解决！”这个主意正中了他们的心怀，于是，他们马上在暗中筹备了一个控诉大会，美其名曰“辩论会”，还把检察院的同志请到会场，企图利用吴美义在会上的发言，把梁某某解送法院。
    但是吴美义并没有迷失方向。棉纺（35）班（吴美义的班级）大多数同学的代表首先发言“对党委的处理表示满意。染化系一年级的那个右派分子接着上台说：“梁的粗暴行为是犯罪的，应该交由法院处理……”，但表示不同意右派分子的师生发言愈来愈多，这个右派分子却故意掩饰着自己的不安，表示自己不了解实际情况，同时他又自相矛盾地说并不是坚持要把梁送法院。这时，主席宣读了吴美义的书面发言：“同学们，我谢谢你们对我的关心和支持。由于梁某某的错误行为使我遭受了痛苦，但是我想开了。这样，也许有人说，我没有做人的气质。不！我有气质，我认为我的气质应该是抱着治病救人的态度，从团结愿望出发，来帮助党整风，帮助党员改正错误。如果一个党员同志的病治好了，我是高兴的，我的气质也得到了真正的考验。梁某某已向我作了道歉，已经面对事实承认了错误，我觉得她进步了。同学们！她的进步，使我忘记了过去的痛苦，我高兴，我轻松，我和她又在新的基础上团结起来了。在建设社会主义的洪流中，我们可以携手并进。……”
    右派分子利用吴美义事件作为向党进攻的阴谋，前后不到五天，就这样被彻底粉碎了。
