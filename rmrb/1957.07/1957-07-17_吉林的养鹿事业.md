    Jilin's Deer Farming Industry
    Wang Lingyun
    Every part of the deer's body is a raw material for medicine, with deer antler being particularly precious. Jilin deer antler has earned a high reputation in the international market.

    Jilin's deer farming industry has always been renowned. As early as sixty years ago, wild deer were captured and bred in captivity. The province's southeastern region has undulating mountains, lush forests, a mild climate, and abundant deer feed – young oak forests.

    Since liberation, the People's Government has placed special emphasis on deer breeding. In recent years, nine deer farms have been established successively; some agricultural cooperatives in Shuangyang, Yitong, Yongji, Panshi, Dunhua, and Hunchun counties also raise deer. Among them, five agricultural cooperatives in Shuangyang County raise more than a thousand deer. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the total number of deer raised in the province will reach more than six thousand. Among them, except for a small portion that are red deer (elk), the rest are sika deer. Due to improved feeding and management levels in deer farming, at present, deer farms can obtain an average of seventy surviving fawns per hundred does annually, with the highest reaching eighty-seven.

    Jilin's deer farming industry has great development prospects. During the first Five-Year Plan period, deer farms produced a total of 45,000 taels of deer antler for the country, worth 2.25 million yuan, which can be exchanged for 10,642 tons of steel. It is estimated that by the end of the second Five-Year Plan period, the number of deer raised in the province will reach more than 17,000.

    Deer have a strong adaptability to the natural environment, and the incidence of disease is also low. There is not much difference from raising general livestock, but they must be raised indoors all year round and cannot be approached by people. In addition to eating oak leaves, deer also like to eat green and dry-stored feed. (Attached picture)

    吉林的养鹿事业
    王凌云
    鹿的全部躯体都是制药的原料，其中特别珍贵的是鹿茸。吉林鹿茸在国际市场上获得了很高的声誉。
    吉林的养鹿事业历来著名，早在六十年前就开始捕获野鹿进行饲养繁殖。省内东南部山峦起伏，林木茂盛，气候温和，还有丰富的鹿饲料——幼柞林。
    解放以后，人民政府特别重视鹿的繁殖。几年来陆续建立养鹿场有九处；在双阳、伊通、永吉、磐石、敦化、珲春等县的部分农业社也都养鹿，其中双阳县的五个农业社就养了千多只鹿。估计在今年末，全省养鹿的总数将达到六千多只。其中除有一小部是黄臀赤鹿（马鹿）外，其余为梅花鹿。由于养鹿的饲养管理水平提高，目前养鹿场每百只母鹿年内平均可获得七十只成活的小鹿，最高的达到八十七只。
    吉林的养鹿事业有很大发展前途，在第一个五年计划期间，鹿场共给国家生产鹿茸四万五千两，总值二百二十五万元，可换回钢材一万零六百四十二吨；预计在第二个五年计划期末，全省养鹿的头数将达到一万七千多只。
    鹿对自然环境适应性很强，发病率也较低，和养一般家畜没有多大区别，但要终年在舍内饲养，并不能使人接近。鹿除爱吃柞树叶外，青绿和干藏饲料也都喜吃。（附图片）
