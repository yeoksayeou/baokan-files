    The Engineering Technology Community Will Not Allow Rightists to Run Wild
    Engineers and Economists of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Gather to Question Shi Qiwen for Reversing Right and Wrong
    Taiyuan News: More than 200 engineers, economists, and responsible party and government cadres from the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant held continuous meetings on the 11th and 18th of this month to denounce the anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies of the bourgeois rightist Shi Qiwen, a safety engineer.
    Taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement, Shi Qiwen launched a series of slanders and attacks against the Party. Using historical analogies, he argued that there was no democracy now, and that things were even worse after liberation than during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. After the nationwide anti-rightist struggle began, Shi Qiwen said that the counterattack against the rightists was again "punishing speakers," and that it was blocking the channels of speech. He even妄想tried to block the mouths of the Party and the broad masses of people, hoping for a fair "third party" to judge right and wrong for them.
    Shi Qiwen's reactionary remarks aroused the indignation of the broad masses of workers. At the meeting of engineers and economists, engineer Nie Ping said: Shi Qiwen compares our people's democratic dictatorship today to the feudal rulers of past dynasties, as if the reactionary dynasties and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang had considerable freedom of speech, which was much better than the "silence" of today. However, everyone knows how many people were beheaded for a single wrong word during the Kuomintang era! Why was Wen Yiduo assassinated? Kuomintang officials protected each other, and corruption was rampant. Where did the common people have a place to speak? American soldiers ran rampant everywhere, defying the law, and no one cared how many people suffered from natural and man-made disasters, freezing and starving to death. Aren't these ironclad facts obvious to all? Shi Qiwen, why do you reverse right and wrong?
    Engineer Li Yongqiu said: Before liberation, university professors had to sell furniture and books because of livelihood pressures; more progressive newspaper offices and publications were often destroyed and banned; in order to fight for peace, more than 100 students and professors were arrested at Zhongshan University alone. Are these all freedoms for intellectuals? Engineer Lu Zuo'an said angrily that Shi Qiwen's so-called "silent" intellectuals refer to whom? You cannot usurp the name of the nation's five million intellectuals; this is a great insult to us.
    Zhang Xiude angrily questioned Shi Qiwen: You said that now "speakers are punished." After liberation, you have long harbored and concealed three counter-revolutionaries. This was originally a crime, but the people did not label you or question your crimes. What is the basis for you to say that speakers are punished?
    Under the unanimous condemnation of the masses, Shi Qiwen continued to quibble, which aroused even greater anger among the people. The masses successively raised accusations and questions to him, and pointed out to him: If you do not dig out the old roots and bow your head to admit your guilt, you will surely isolate yourself from the people.

    工程技术界不让右派猖狂
    太原重型机器厂工程师经济师集会
    质问史企文为什么颠倒是非
    太原讯　太原重型机器厂全厂工程师、经济师及党政负责干部二百余人，于本月11、18两日连续集会，痛斥资产阶级右派分子安全工程师史企文的反共、反社会主义谬论。
    史企文趁着共产党整风的机会，向党进行了一连串的污蔑和攻击。他借古喻今，认为现在没有民主，解放以后甚至还不如国民党反动统治时期。全国开展反右派斗争以后，史企文说反击右派又是“言者有罪”了，是堵塞言路了。他还妄想堵住党和广大人民的嘴，希望出现个公正的“第三者”来为他们评是非。
    史企文的反动言论，引起了广大职工的愤慨。在工程师、经济师的集会上，工程师聂平说：史企文以历代的封建统治者来比喻我们今天的人民民主专政国家，好像历代反动王朝和国民党的反动统治还有相当大的言论自由，比之今天“噤若寒蝉”也要好得多。然而，尽人皆知国民党时期有多少人由于一言之差而遭到杀头之罪！为什么闻一多被暗杀？国民党官官相护，贪污风行，那有老百姓说话的地方！美国兵到处横冲直撞，无法无天，多少人遭到天灾人祸，冻死饿死也没有人管。这些铁的事实难道不是有目共睹的吗？史企文你为什么要颠倒是非？
    工程师李永求说：解放以前的大学教授因生活所迫不得不变卖家具和书籍；进步一些的报馆和书刊常被捣毁、被禁封；我们为了争取和平，单中山大学就被逮捕了一百多名学生和教授。这些难道都是知识分子的自由吗？工程师陆佐安气愤地说，史企文所谓“噤若寒蝉”的知识分子究竟是指的那些人，你不能盗用全国五百万知识分子的名义，这对我们是极大的污辱。
    张修德愤慨地质问史企文：你说现在是“言者有罪”，解放以后，你长期包庇和隐瞒过三个反革命分子，这本来是有罪的，可是人民并没有给你扣帽子，也没有问你的罪，你说言者有罪的根据是什么呢？
    在群众的一致谴责下，史企文继续狡辩，更激起了大家的气愤，群众纷纷向他提出指责和质问，并且给他指出：如果不挖出老根，低头认罪，一定会自绝于人民。
