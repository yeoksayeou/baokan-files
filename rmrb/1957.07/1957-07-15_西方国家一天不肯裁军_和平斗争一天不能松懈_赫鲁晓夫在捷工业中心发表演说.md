Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 14th: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Soviet Party and Government delegation split into two groups on the 13th, departing from Bratislava to visit Ostrava and Brno.

    The section of the delegation headed by Khrushchev arrived in Ostrava, the industrial center of Czechoslovakia. They were accompanied by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotný, and member of the Politburo, Barak. They first visited the Klement Gottwald Metallurgical Plant and had lunch inside the factory. In the afternoon, a mass rally attended by more than 60,000 people was held in Stalin Square. Khrushchev delivered a speech at the rally.

    Khrushchev said that the Soviet people believe that the socialist achievements of the Soviet Union are not only their own achievements, but also the achievements of the working people of all countries. These achievements have strengthened the progressive forces of the world and the socialist forces. If anyone wants to undermine the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and our friends, the Czechoslovakians, Chinese, Polish, Romanian, Bulgarian, Albanian and other people of the socialist camp, then we will give them the response they deserve.

    Speaking on the issue of disarmament, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet people desire peace, just as the Czechoslovak people desire peace. The people of all countries who live by their own labor also desire peace.

    Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has put forward concrete proposals for disarmament, including proposals to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. We are doing everything possible to strive for peaceful and friendly coexistence with all countries in the world. We hope for peaceful coexistence. However, the Western countries still do not want to reach an agreement with us.

    Khrushchev said that as long as the representatives of the Western countries have not been forced to listen to the voices of the people of the world and move towards disarmament, banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, and prohibiting the testing of such weapons, then we will never relax our struggle for peace.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the people of all countries, including the American people, want this to happen.

    The section of the delegation headed by Bulganin, accompanied by Prime Minister Široký, arrived in Brno, the second largest city in Czechoslovakia. They visited the large-scale machine-building enterprise in the city, the Sverdma factory. In the afternoon, a mass rally was held at the Brno stadium. Bulganin spoke at the meeting. He spoke about the deep friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and the relationship between the countries of the socialist camp. He said that there has never been such friendship as that between socialist countries in the world. He also spoke about the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and the efforts made by the two countries to ease international tensions and prevent new wars.

    After visiting these two cities, the Soviet Party and Government delegation has already set off to return to Prague.

    西方国家一天不肯裁军  和平斗争一天不能松懈
    赫鲁晓夫在捷工业中心发表演说
    新华社布拉格14日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，苏联党和政府代表团13日分成两批从布拉迪斯拉发出发到俄斯特拉发和布尔诺两地访问。
    以赫鲁晓夫为首的代表团一部分人员来到了捷克斯洛伐克的工业中心俄斯特拉发。陪同他们一道的有捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼和政治局委员巴拉克。他们首先参观了克利门特·哥特瓦尔德冶金工厂，并且在工厂内进了午餐。下午在斯大林广场举行了有六万多人参加的群众大会。赫鲁晓夫在大会上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人认为苏联的社会主义成果不仅是自己的成果，而且也是各国劳动人民的成果。这些成果增强了世界进步力量和社会主义力量。如果有人想破坏苏联人民和我们的朋友捷克斯洛伐克人、中国人、波兰人、罗马尼亚人、保加利亚人、阿尔巴尼亚人和社会主义阵营其他各国人民的和平劳动，那么我们将给予应有的反击。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到裁军问题时指出，苏联人民希望和平，正如同捷克斯洛伐克人民希望和平一样。靠自己的劳动生活的各国人民也都希望和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府提出了具体的裁军建议，提出了禁止使用原子武器和氢武器等建议。我们正在尽一切力量争取同世界各国和平友好共处。我们希望和平共处。但是西方国家直到现在还不希望同我们达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，只要西方国家的代表还没有被迫倾听全世界人民的呼声而走向裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器以及禁止这类武器的试验，那么我们就决不放松争取和平的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，所有国家的人民，包括美国人民在内，都希望这样做。
    以布尔加宁为首的一部分代表团人员在西罗基总理陪同下来到了捷克斯洛伐克的第二大城市布尔诺。他们参观了市内规模巨大的机器制造企业——斯维尔马工厂。下午在布尔诺运动场举行了群众大会。布尔加宁在会上讲了话。他谈到了苏捷两国的深厚友谊和社会主义阵营国家之间的关系。他说，世界上从来没有过像社会主义国家之间的这种友谊。他还谈到苏捷两国的和平外交政策和两国为缓和国际紧张局势和防止新战争而进行的努力。
    苏联党和政府代表团在访问了这两个城市之后已经动身回布拉格。
