    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 6th: The People's Tribunal of the Hungarian Supreme Court accepted the appeal case of counter-revolutionary criminals Toth and others and announced the final trial results on the 4th.
    The Supreme Court announced that it would uphold the original verdict of the Budapest City Court for the counter-revolutionary criminals Toth, Gyöngyösi, and Gerencsér, sentencing them to death. The original sentence of ten years' imprisonment for the criminal Kovács was changed to the death penalty. The death sentences of the counter-revolutionary criminals Obersovszky Gyula (journalist) and Gáli József (writer), who had previously been sentenced to death, were commuted to life imprisonment and fifteen years imprisonment respectively. The death sentences handed down by the Supreme Court have been carried out.
    Most of these criminals participated in the counter-revolutionary riots of October last year. They committed crimes such as killing workers, instigating strikes, consciously carrying out various inflammatory propaganda activities against the worker-peasant revolutionary government, and attempting to restore capitalism.
