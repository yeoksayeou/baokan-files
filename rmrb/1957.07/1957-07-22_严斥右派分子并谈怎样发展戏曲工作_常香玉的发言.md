    I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou’s and all the leading comrades’ reports, and I support the stern lessons given to the rightists.
    Our Life Experiences Have Made Us Recognize Who Our Relatives Are
    I am an actress. In the old society, I was a miserable "performer," and in the new society, I am a proud people's actress. Now, representing our opera workers, I want to say a few words from my heart.
    These days, the rightists' absurd remarks and sinful behaviors have aroused our anger and caused our hatred. In the old society, everyone knows the sufferings of actors. They were truly forced to smile on stage while weeping backstage. Bureaucrats, landlords, the Kuomintang, feudal bosses, the "Ten Evils," and the "Eight Harms" all weighed down on the actors. If they wanted to bully you, they had killing guns. If they wanted to drive you away, they had secret agents, hooligans, and villains. They forced us to a point where we had no way to go to heaven and no door to enter hell. We wandered east and drifted west. Heaven wouldn't keep us, and the earth wouldn't take us; it was like being a child without a mother. As big as China was, there was no place for us actors to settle down. How many actors were abused by them, and how many were killed? Not to mention others, among the actors who performed on the same stage with me, I personally saw two die in their hands! Yu opera actress Yang Guiyun's father was bombed to death by Kuomintang secret agents in Kaifeng, and Ma Xiaoming and Yang Laoer were injured by their bombs. There was also a very talented young actress named Little Sister Xi Shun who was performing in Mi County when she caught the eye of a reactionary army officer's regimental commander. He wanted to take her as his own, and because she didn't agree, they killed her with a hidden gun. There were also a large number of talented and good actors who were forced to stop performing and leave their beloved stage. For example, Si Fengying, a famous Yu opera actress who hadn't performed for sixteen years, Chen Bohua, a famous Han opera actress who hadn't performed for seventeen years, Jia Guilin, a famous Shanxi opera actress who hadn't performed for eighteen years, etc., all suffered misfortune under that cannibalistic social system. They never dreamed that their stage life could be revived, but the Chinese Communist Party saved China and also revived their artistic lives, allowing them to reappear with youthful vigor on the stage and be welcomed by thousands upon thousands of audience members. At the same time, the Party is particularly good at leading and caring for us in art. It has established many opera schools for us and built many theaters for us. It has filmed many local operas and revived many ancient opera forms. It has also helped us to excavate more than 50,000 traditional plays… The rightists say that the Party cannot lead literature and art. These great achievements are a relentless refutation of them. The benefits of the Communist Party are the same as those felt by people from all walks of life. They are truly very good. The benefits of the Party are so numerous that I could stand on this platform for three days and three nights and not finish talking about them. Therefore, our actors often say that having the Communist Party is like a child without a mother finding their mother. Our life experiences have made us recognize who our relatives are and who our enemies are. Rightists! Your conspiracies and tricks are a reactionary and sinful restoration. We will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate you! We will follow the Communist Party forever, and we will also lead our sons and grandsons with us!
    The reason why we are irreconcilably opposed to the rightists and will fight them to the end is because their hearts are the opposite of ours. We want to love the Party, and they want to oppose the Party. We want to build socialism, and they want to sabotage socialism. I used to be a little strange. I wondered why the rightists still want to oppose such a good Party and such a good socialist system. Why do we feel it is very good, but they insist on saying it is not good? Later, after reading the People's Daily editorial, I realized that this is a fundamental issue—a matter of position. Because they have a different position from us, the same thing is viewed and felt differently. The same is true in the opera world. For example, those rightists stubbornly say that the Communist Party is not good and vainly attempt to create a "political design institute," but we firmly believe that the Communist Party is really very good. Because artists have turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party, their political status has improved, their lives are happier, and their artistic careers have greatly developed. Compared to the bitter days of the old society, this is naturally too good. And those rightists are "the full don't know what the hungry suffer." They are warlords, politicians, and bloated pleasure-seekers. How would they know the suffering of the people in the old society? So, even though it is the same old society, the people hate it, but the rightists like it. Don't they say, "Capitalism has good and bad aspects"? They also say that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was done poorly and want to rehabilitate "them." But in the eyes of us actors, we think this is very good. Not only is it not wrong, but it is 100% right and correct. In the eyes of these warlords and politicians, it was right for them to smash theaters, oppress actors, and even kill and murder in the old society, but in the eyes of us actors, that is a million times wrong, and we must resolutely oppose it. Ah! I completely understand. Their position is like this. Under the Party's "demon-revealing mirror," they have one by one revealed their ugly original forms.
    So it is no wonder that they turn a blind eye to the great achievements of the new China's various constructions and write them all off; instead, they slanderously claim that this lovely new China is pitch black. Now we want to solemnly tell the rightists: the reactionaries and the old society are our enemies. We have seen through your anti-Party and anti-people tricks, which are intended to make the people return to the old society and become slaves and beasts of burden again. And even now, some rightists are still unrepentant and are still swaggering in front of the people. If you don't follow Premier Zhou's instructions, quickly "wake up to the truth, accept transformation," and bow your heads to the people to admit your guilt, then you must remember: the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have machine guns that hit the target every time, the workers have unforgiving sledgehammers, the peasants have solid hard carrying poles, and our opera world also has all-around proficient "eighteen weapons." Let me be frank and clear: the people will never relax or be lenient on this issue!
    Two Suggestions on Developing Opera Work
    In addition, in order to further implement Premier Zhou’s government work report's "instructions on the people's cultural life," I have two suggestions:
    (1) Vigorously promote privately-run opera schools to resolve the contradiction of insufficient successors in various opera genres
    Premier Zhou said in his report: "In addition to state-run schools, we should actively promote collectively-run schools and individually-run schools to fully utilize the strength of social groups and the masses to supplement the inadequacy of the state's strength." Although this instruction refers to the education sector, it is equally applicable to our opera sector.
    After liberation, our country thought of many ways to cultivate opera talents and established many opera schools, but it neglected the traditional role of privately-run opera schools. Therefore, it focused on cultivating state opera schools, which is of course appropriate. However, the promotion and support for privately-run opera schools is insufficient. Not only is there little help in terms of manpower and financial resources, but some individuals often one-sidedly emphasize their shortcomings, saying that their systems are feudal and do not promote democracy; that their methods are backward and violate science (old methods certainly have shortcomings). As a result, in troupes that already have students, they are left to their own devices and allowed to drift; those who want to recruit students are afraid to try.
    Some of the training methods are also not in line with the laws of Chinese opera art. A common problem is that the requirements for arduous study and practice are not strict enough. As soon as it gets strict, they say it is not democratic, and students can disregard etiquette and the environment to give the teacher their opinions, to the point where the teachers are not only afraid to seriously demand anything from the students, but are often embarrassed to tears. In this situation, it is hard to imagine that the old masters' art can be fully taught and that the students' studies can surpass their teachers. Based on my personal experience, learning art requires suffering and hardship; otherwise, you cannot become a good actor who is skilled in both literary and martial arts and excels in singing and acting. To learn opera, the learner must have sufficient willpower, and objectively must undergo special grinding. All accomplished opera actors have followed this path. Therefore, to learn opera, one must accept strict requirements and study and practice diligently. There is no shortcut to be found.
    Due to the above reasons, the healthy growth of young opera actors has been seriously affected, and I myself, like many opera artists, am anxious about this. Should we rely on state opera schools? The number of people trained is too small to meet the needs of troupes across the country. Moreover, these schools can only take care of a few major opera genres, and the smaller and medium-sized opera genres cannot be taken care of. So what should we do? Should private individuals take apprentices? Not only is the number of people very small, but there are many practical difficulties, which is also a problem. What should we do? I believe that vigorously promoting privately-run opera schools is a good way to solve the problem of successors in various opera genres, especially promoting troupes to run their own schools.
    Troupes running their own schools have many favorable conditions: they have veteran artists and famous actors, so there is no difficulty with teachers. They have stages, orchestras, and costumes, so the students' practice problems are solved. And some troupes with good conditions are not economically difficult, so the funding problem is also solved. Especially since the central government called for vigorously excavating heritage and respecting veteran artists, the artists are very enthusiastic about cultivating the next generation. Everyone is putting up their spirits and eager to try. As long as the central government vigorously promotes them, they will definitely not admit they are old and will spare no effort. The central government should not only vigorously promote them, but also hope that the Ministry of Culture can formulate some specific measures for support and rewards, such as regularly holding observation and performance meetings for young actors and privately-run opera schools, such as allocating a certain amount of cultural funds to reward troupes running opera schools and to reward successful veteran artists (referring to teachers), leaders, and young actors. In addition, local governments should be required to give special care to troupes running opera schools and to help them improve teacher-student relations.
    In short, as long as the leadership vigorously promotes and provides appropriate rewards, and combines this with the enthusiasm of the artists, the privately-run opera schools will play a very large role in cultivating opera successors with little money and effort. Premier Zhou's instructions have helped us to find the key to the lock.
    (2) Implement a "base salary plus bonus wage system" in opera troupes
    Premier Zhou said in his report: "The state can only centrally run a small number of exemplary literary and sports undertakings and guide them towards self-sufficiency." In order to specifically implement Premier Zhou’s "self-sufficiency" instruction, I believe that changing the current grading and salary system of opera troupes and implementing a "base salary plus bonus wage system" is one of the important methods, because this method is basically based on income and expenditure and is also in line with the standard of remuneration according to labor.
    The levels and wage grades in literature and art are inherently difficult to formulate. For example, for writers, it is difficult to say that someone is a first-class writer or a second-class writer, and it is even more difficult to fix their monthly remuneration, because the amount of this remuneration (wage) is only reasonable if it is based on the quality and quantity of his works. Opera art is basically the same. At the same time, each opera genre has its own artistic characteristics, and each troupe also has its own specific situation. Moreover, there are outstanding performers in all roles: Sheng (male), Dan (female), Jing (painted-face male), Mo (old male), and Chou (clown), and there are also specialists in music, directing, playwriting, and stage art. In fact, it is difficult to uniformly stipulate artistic standards, but all state-owned troupes are now graded and paid according to the measures promulgated by the Central Ministry of Culture. The measures are divided into sixteen levels, and each level stipulates a certain amount of salary. I think this method is suitable for administrative organs, but not suitable for opera troupes. Some troupes, after being graded and paid, have fixed salaries, and the government has to take money out every month to pay the troupes. When I performed in Jiaozuo City in March this year, the Yu opera troupe in the city was like this, but before the implementation of fixed salaries, the troupe could be self-sufficient. So what is the reason? I think it is because this grading and salary system is not suitable for the actual situation of the troupe.
    There used to be two systems for wages in the opera world, one was the "contract troupe," which was a fixed salary system, and the other was the "republican troupe," which was a system of "fixed shares and flexible bonuses." These two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. I think that combining these two methods and supplementing them appropriately would be a feasible wage system, or give it the name "base salary plus bonus wage system." Its main method is:
    1. First, according to the minimum living standard of each staff member of the troupe, set a base number as the base salary and pay it monthly to ensure that he and his family are not frozen or starving.
    2. Withdraw a certain percentage of the troupe's income as the troupe's fund, troupe's construction fee, and welfare fund to ensure the troupe's personnel have living and artistic creation during the off-season.
    3. After deducting the troupe's construction fee, fund, and welfare fund, the remaining income is divided among all members of the troupe (except for fixed-wage personnel such as cooks) according to shares.
    4. The number of shares each person receives is democratically determined by everyone, approved by the troupe committee, and publicly divided at the end of the month. The criteria for scoring can be stipulated based on each person's artistic quality, work attitude, and combined with the specific person and the troupe's specific situation.
    5. The assessment period can be tentatively set for about half a year at a time.
    Such a wage system has at least the following advantages: it can naturally strengthen artistic practice, because if you don't perform more, you won't get more wages; it can also promote the improvement of artistic quality, because if the troupe's performance is not good, the audience can choose not to watch your performance. If the individual's art is not improved, you will not receive more remuneration for your labor; in particular, it can also reduce the state's subsidies, because this wage system is self-sufficient and belongs to the category of collective ownership by the workers.
    At the same time, it is more customary for the troupe to implement this method, and everyone is more likely to accept it: because people with lower wages have the base salary to guarantee their lives, while people with higher salaries have the benefit of remuneration according to labor, which can make up for the deficiency of the base salary.
    Based on the above, I believe that the "base salary plus bonus system" is a feasible way to solve the wage contradiction in opera troupes. And I advocate that this method should be gradually changed in state-owned troupes that have already implemented grading and salary systems in order to implement Premier Zhou's instruction that literary and artistic undertakings should "move towards self-sufficiency."

    严斥右派分子并谈怎样发展戏曲工作
    常香玉的发言
    我衷心拥护周总理和各位首长的报告，并且拥护对右派分子所作的严正的教训。
    我们的生活经历使我们认清了谁是亲人
    我是一个演员，在旧社会我是一个苦“戏子”，在新社会我是一个自豪的人民演员。我现在代表我们戏曲工作者，要说几句心窝里要说的话。
    这些日子，右派分子的荒谬言论和罪恶行为，激起了我们的愤怒；引起了我们的仇恨。在旧社会，演员所受的苦处大家是知道的，真是在前台强作欢笑，回后台眼泪巴巴。官僚、地主、国民党、封建把头、十大恶、八大害压在演员头上的可说是样样俱全。要欺负你，他们有的是杀人的手枪；要赶走你，他们有的是特务、流氓和恶棍。把我们逼得上天无路，入地无门。流浪到东，又漂流到西。天不留，地不收，就像个没娘的孩子一样。中国之大，却没有一块地方是我们演员的安身之处。多少演员遭到他们的玩弄，多少演员遭到他们的杀害。别的不说，就在和我同台演戏的演员中，我就亲眼看到有两个死在他们的手中！豫剧演员杨桂云的爸爸在开封被国民党特务炸死，马小明、杨老二被他们炸伤。还有一个很有天才的青年女演员名叫喜顺的小妹妹，在密县演出时，被一个反动军官的团长看上了，要霸占她，因为没答应，竟被他们暗枪打死。还有大批的有才能的好演员，被逼的停止了演唱，离开了她们心爱的舞台。像十六年没演戏的豫剧名演员司凤英，十七年没演戏的汉剧名演员陈伯华，十八年没演戏的山西梆子名演员贾桂林……等，就都是在那个吃人的社会制度下遭到了不幸。他们做梦也想不到她们的舞台生命再能复活，可是中国共产党救活了中国，也救活她们的艺术生命。使她们在舞台上青春再现，又受到千千万万观众们的欢迎。同时党在艺术上尤其善于领导我们，关怀我们，为我们办了许多戏曲学校，为我们建立了许多剧院。把许多地方戏曲拍成电影，把许多古老的戏种救活。还帮助我们挖掘了五万多个传统剧目……。右派分子说党领导不了文艺，这些巨大成绩，便是对他们无情的驳斥。共产党的好处我们也和其他各界人民的感受一样，真是好的很，党的好处叫我站在讲台上是三天三夜都说不完的。所以我们演员们常说，演员有了共产党，就像是没有娘的孩子找到了娘。我们的生活经历，使我们认清了谁是我们的亲人，谁是我们的仇敌。右派分子！你们的阴谋诡计，是反动罪恶的复辟，我们要和全国人民一道，坚决、彻底消灭你！我们要永远跟着共产党走，并且还要领上我们儿子和孙子！
    我们所以要与右派分子誓不两立，斗争到底的原因，就是因为他们和我们的心事相反，我们要爱党，他们要反党。我们要建设社会主义，他们要破坏社会主义。我原来有些奇怪，我想这样好的党，这样好的社会主义制度，为什么右派分子还要来反对呢？为什么我们感到好的很，他们偏偏说不好呢？后来读了人民日报的社论，才弄清了这是一个根本问题——立场问题。因为他们和我们的立场不同，所以同样的一件事情，看法和感受也就两样。在戏剧界也是如此，比如那些右派分子硬说共产党不好，妄想搞什么“政治设计院”，但我们确认为共产党实在好的很。因为艺人们在共产党的领导下翻了身，政治地位提高了，日子过的幸福了，艺术事业得以大大的发展了。这和旧社会那种苦日子比起来自然是太好了。而那些右派分子们，乃是“饱汉不知饿汉饥”，他们是军阀、政客和大腹便便的享福人，哪里知道人民在旧社会的苦楚呢？所以同样是旧社会，人民痛恨它，右派分子却喜欢它，你看他们不是说：“资本主义有好有坏”吗？他们还说肃反搞糟了，要替“他们”平反。但在我们演员看来，偏偏认为这事好的很，不但没有错，而且是百分之百的应该和正确。在这些军阀、政客看来，他们在旧社会砸戏院子，压迫演员甚至杀人害命就都是应该的，但在我们演员们看起来，那便是万万个不应该，并且要坚决反对它。啊！我完全明白了，他们的立场原来如此。他们在党的照妖镜下，一个个现出了丑恶原形。
    所以无怪乎他们对新中国各项建设的伟大成就，视而不见，一笔抹煞；反而血口喷人，把这样可爱的新中国说成是一团漆黑。现在我们要严正的告诉右派分子：反动派、旧社会是我们的仇敌，我们已经看清了你们那种反党、反人民的伎俩是要使人民重回到旧社会，再叫人民去当奴隶、作牛马。并且至今还有些右派分子执迷不悟；还在人民的面前摆来摆去。如果你们不按照周总理的指示，赶快“憣然悔悟，接受改造”，向人民低头认罪的话，你们可要记着：解放军志愿军，他们有百发百中的机关枪，工人们，他们有毫不留情的大铁锤，农民们，他们有结结实实的硬扁担，我们戏曲界还有着件件精通的十八般武器。干脆明确的告诉你们：人民在这个问题上是决不放松，决不留情的！
    关于发展戏曲工作的两项建议
    此外，为了进一步贯彻周总理政府工作报告中的“关于人民文化生活的指示”，我有两点建议：
    （一）大力提倡民办科班，解决各剧种后继人才不足的矛盾
    总理在报告中说：“除了国家办学以外，我们应该积极提倡集体办学，个人办学，充分发挥社会集团和群众的力量，以补充国家力量之不足。”这个指示虽然说的是教育界，但同样适合于我们戏曲界。
    解放后我们国家为了培养戏曲人材，曾经想了许多办法，办了许多戏曲学校，但是却忽视了民办科班的传统作用。因而重点的培养了国家戏曲学校，这当然是应该的。而对于民办科班的提倡和支持则是不够的。不但在人力财力上帮助很少，甚至有个别人还常常片面强调它们的缺点。说它们制度封建不讲民主；说它们方法落后违反科学（老办法当然是有缺点的）。以致在已经收有学生的剧团中，则放之任之，听其自流；想收学生的也就望而生畏，不敢尝试了。
    在训练的方法上有些也不合乎我国戏曲艺术的规律。普遍的毛病是在苦学苦练上要求不严。一严了就说不民主，学生就可以不讲方式，不择环境提老师的意见，以致弄得老师不但不敢认真要求学生，甚至往往把老师难为的哭鼻子。在这种情况下很难想像老师傅的艺术能以都教出来，学生的学业能够青出于蓝。根据我个人的体会，学艺就是要受罪吃苦的，否则你就不能成为一个能文能武，唱做俱佳的好演员。要学戏曲这一套东西，学的人本身必需有十足的毅力，同时在客观上还要受特殊的挟磨，一切有成就的戏曲演员都是沿着这条道路走过来的，所以要学戏就得接受严格的要求，就得苦学苦练，想找一条省事而容易的便道是没有的。
    由于以上种种原因，青年戏曲演员的健康成长受到了相当严重的影响，我自己也和许多戏曲艺人一样，为此焦急。依靠国家戏曲学校吧？培养的人数实在太少，供不上全国剧团的需要，而且这些学校只能照顾到几个大的剧种，更多的中小型剧种戏校里又顾不过来，又该怎么办呢？私人带徒弟吧？不但人数很少，且存在许多实际困难，也是问题。怎么办呢？我认为大力提倡民办科班是解决各个剧种后继人材的好办法，特别是提倡剧团自办科班。
    剧团自办科班有许多有利的条件：他们有老艺人，有名演员，师资问题不用作难。他们有舞台，又有乐队和服装，学生实践的问题解决了。还有一些条件好的剧团，经济并不困难，这样经费问题也解决了。特别是自从中央号召大力挖掘遗产和尊重老艺人以来，艺人们对培养下一代的热情很高，大家都在鼓足精神，跃跃欲试。只要中央加以大力提倡，他们一定会不服老，不惜力的。中央不但要大力提倡，同时还希望文化部能订出一些具体扶持和奖励的办法：如定期举行青年演员和民办科班的观摩会演，如拨出一定的文化事业费用来奖励办科班的剧团，奖励有成绩的老艺人（指师傅）、领导人和青年演员。此外如规定各地政府对于办有科班的剧团，应加以特殊的照顾，以及帮助他们改善师生关系问题等等。
    总之只要领导上大力提倡并给以适当的奖励，再和艺人的积极性结合起来，花钱不多，费力不大，而民办科班在培养戏曲后继人材上所起的作用，将是非常巨大的。总理的指示，使我们找到了关键的锁钥。
    （二）在戏曲剧团中实行“基薪分酬工资制”
    总理在报告中说：“国家只能集中的举办少数的示范性的文艺和体育事业，并且引导他们走向自给。”为了具体贯彻总理这个“走向自给”的指示，我认为改变目前戏曲剧团的评级评薪制度，实行“基薪分酬工资制”是重要的方法之一，因为这种办法，基本上是量入为出的，也是符合按劳取酬标准的。
    文艺方面的级别和工资等级，本来是很难制定的。比如作家，就很难说某人是一级作家，某人是二级作家，更很难固定他每月的劳动报酬，因为这个报酬（工资）的多少，只有根据他的作品的质量和数量作标准才算合理。戏曲艺术基本上也是如此，同时一个剧种有一个剧种的艺术特点，一个剧团也有一个剧团的具体情况，而且生、旦、净、末、丑，行行出状元，还有音乐、导演、编剧、舞台美术等也都各有专长。事实上，艺术标准很难给它统一规定，但是各个国营剧团现在都是按照中央文化部颁布的办法评级评薪，办法分为十六级，某级又规定了一定的工资数目。我认为这种办法用于行政机关则可，用于戏曲剧团就不够恰当。还有一些剧团在评级评薪以后，由于固定了工资，政府就要每月拿出钱来给剧团发薪金。今年三月我在焦作市演出时，该市的豫剧团就是这样，而在未实行固定工资以前，这个剧团是可以自给自足的。那么原因何在呢？我想就是这种评级评薪的工资制度不适合于剧团的实际情况所造成的。
    戏曲界在工资方面从前有两种制度，一种是包帐班，即固定薪金制；一种是共和班，即死分活批工资的办法。这两种办法各有利弊，我觉着把这两种办法结合起来再加以适当的补充，就是一种可行的工资制度或者给它定名为“基薪分酬工资制”，其主要作法是：
    1、先按照剧团每个工作人员的最低生活标准，定个基数作为基薪，按月发给，以保证他本人及家庭生活不至冻馁。
    2、在剧团收入中分别抽出一定的百分比，作为剧团的基金、剧团的建设费和福利金等，以保证剧团人员在淡季时节生活和艺术创造的进行。
    3、在提出了剧团的建设费和基金、福利金之后，所节余的收入由全团（除固定工资人员外如炊事员等）成员按分数共分。
    4、每人各占几分由大家民主评定，由团委会核准，月终公分一次。评分的标准可根据每人的艺术质量、劳动态度，并结合具体人和剧团的具体情况规定内容。
    5、评定的期间可暂定半年左右一次。
    这样的工资制至少有以下几种好处：它可以自然的加强艺术实践，因为不多演出就分不到更多的工资；它还可以促进艺术质量的提高，因为剧团演出的戏不好，观众就可以不看你的戏，本人的艺术提不高，你就拿不到较多的劳动报酬；特别是它还可以减少国家的补贴，因为这种工资制是自给自足的，属于劳动者集体所有制的范畴。
    同时在剧团实行这种办法比较习惯，大家也容易接受：因为工资小的人，由于有了基薪保证了自己的生活，而薪金较大的人，又有了按劳分酬的好处，可以弥补基薪之不足。
    基于以上种种情况，我认为“基薪分酬制”在解决戏曲剧团中的工资矛盾问题上，是一种可行的办法。并且我主张在已经实行评级评薪的国营剧团中也逐步改行这个办法。来贯彻总理这个文艺事业“走向自给”的指示。
