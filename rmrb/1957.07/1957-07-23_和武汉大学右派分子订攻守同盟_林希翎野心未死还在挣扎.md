    Forming an Alliance with Rightist Elements from Wuhan University
    Lin Xiling's Wild Ambitions Remain, Still Struggling
    (Our dispatch) According to the China Youth Daily, the rightist Lin Xiling's anti-Party, anti-people ambitions are still alive, and she continues to form alliances with her accomplices.

    On the 11th (postmark time), Lin Xiling sent an airmail letter from Beijing to her accomplice Wu Kaibin, a leading rightist at Wuhan University. In the letter, she distorted the truth, slandered the teachers and students of the People's University of China, and accused the newspapers of fabricating and distorting their exposure and criticism of her, saying, "I could jump into the Yellow River and still not clear my name." She also said in the letter: "Regarding the matter of lending the report (China Youth Daily reporter's note: i.e., a secret state report she stole from a central government agency) to you and whether or not I mentioned delivering my letter? If not, and if no one else knows, then please don't mention it under any circumstances. Because my 'crimes' are already numerous enough. If it has been mentioned, please write me a long letter telling me what was said." In order to destroy evidence of her crimes, she also added a note at the end of the letter, "Burn this letter after reading, absolutely!"

    Unfortunately for her, when the letter arrived at Wuhan University, the students had already heightened their vigilance in the anti-rightist struggle. Although the envelope was marked "Details Inside," the students immediately recognized that it was from Lin Xiling. Wu Kaibin, seeing that it had been discovered by the masses, had no choice but to hand over the letter.

    和武汉大学右派分子订攻守同盟
    林希翎野心未死还在挣扎
    本报讯　据中国青年报消息：右派分子林希翎反党反人民的野心至今未死，还在与她的同党订立攻守同盟。
    11日（邮戳时间）林希翎从北京给她的同党武汉大学右派首领吴开斌寄去一封航空信，在信上，她颠倒黑白，诬蔑中国人民大学师生和报纸对她的揭发和批判是捏造和歪曲，说“我跳到黄河也洗不清”。她并在信上说：“关于借报告（中国青年报记者注：即她从中央某机关偷出的一份国家机密报告）给你看的事及我给你的信交了说了没有？若未说，若别人均不知道的话，那请千万别说。因我的‘罪名’已够多了，若已说了，就写封长信给我，告诉我说了些什么。”她为了销毁她的罪恶痕迹，还在信的末尾注了一笔“此信阅毕焚毁，切切！”
    可是事不凑巧，当此信寄到武汉大学时，同学们在反右派中已提高警惕，虽然信封上写着“内详”二字，但同学们一眼就认出是林希翎的来信，吴开斌看见已被群众发现，只得将信交出来。
