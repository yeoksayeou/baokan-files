Lu Lin
——A Visit to Dorna County, Hungary (III)
By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang

    Twenty kilometers from Szekszárd lies the famous Gemenc Forest, known for its world-renowned red deer. Leaving Dege Village, we found old man Bagić, the head of the forest management, at the end of the village. According to Comrade Szamos, he is a famous hunter in Europe. He led us to the first hunting station, then slung his shotgun over his shoulder, boarded a carriage, and we began our journey into the forest.
    This forest stretches over fifty kilometers in length, more than ten kilometers in width, and one hundred and twenty kilometers in circumference, covering a total area of sixteen thousand hectares (equivalent to two hundred and fifty-six thousand mu), making it the largest forest in Hungary.
    After the rain, the air in the forest was particularly fresh, but the muddy road made the carriage bounce like a small boat in a storm. The cloudy sky revealed the weak rays of the evening sun. At this time, all that could be heard were the heavy sounds of the horses' hooves and the singing of birds in the forest.
    The carriage turned into a small path in the forest. Branches of small trees often blocked our way, and we had to bow our heads to avoid them. Old man Bagić and the coachman were silent all the way, and did not allow us to speak or laugh loudly, for fear of disturbing the masters of the forest. We passed through many paths, and after nearly an hour, we still hadn't seen a single deer or any other animals. Comrade Szamos couldn't help but whisper, "Our old man didn't send a message to the Deer King beforehand to inform him that guests from the East were coming to visit today." The driver, István, added, "As I see it, the Deer King and his subjects have been invited by the little rabbits to celebrate Easter, and we've come at the wrong time." Bagić seemed to hear our conversation and chimed in, "Now is the spring breeding season, they are all hiding in their nests."
    At the end of a small path, the outside suddenly opened up to a green meadow in the forest, the spring dining room for the fawns. Another meadow was surrounded by wooden fences, which was the deer's winter dining hall. In addition, there were several plots of tilled land here, ready to be sown with corn to provide food for the wild animals.
    We were pulled into the forest again by two steeds. Bagić used his binoculars hanging on his chest to look around and found deer in the forest and by the roadside. At this time, the horses slowed down, and the carriage moved forward slowly and steadily. Everyone had an expression like children tiptoeing to catch a little rabbit or pounce on a butterfly. Bagić took off his felt hat with emerald feathers and saluted the Deer King in his heart. Then he cupped his hands around his mouth and made the sound of a fawn, trying to lure the two big deer in front of him. The big deer standing in front were whispering to each other. After hearing the sound, they looked up and gazed at us. After hesitating for a moment, they finally recognized the two brown horses approaching them and went into the woods.
    The hunters here are the protectors of the deer. The hunter's job in the spring is to patrol the newborn fawns and prevent bears and wild boars from eating them. Driver István pointed at Bagić and said, "They are like the police in Budapest. Their hunting targets are those brutal exploiters in the animal kingdom."
    Our purpose was finally achieved. We saw several precious deer, the deer of Gemenc Forest. Everyone began talking about old man Bagić. Comrade Szamos said, "The old man knows this forest as well as he knows the palm of his hand." Bagić smiled proudly upon hearing this. "His father was also a hunter, and he has been hunting with his father since he was a child. He has spent decades of his life in the forest, and he is particularly knowledgeable about raising deer." Bagić continued, "There are more than a hundred kinds of deer. As far as he knows, China doesn't have this kind of Hungarian deer. Its characteristic is that the antlers are long and numerous, up to twenty-eight to thirty-two. The antlers are very heavy, and their value lies here. In Hungary, deer antlers are not yet used to make medicine, mainly as ornaments. The antlers themselves are not worth much. If you take the antlers to sell, you won't get much money." In Europe, it is a traditional custom for shooting deer to be a noble entertainment for court aristocrats. Modern-day tycoons in Germany, France, Switzerland, and other countries also enjoy shooting deer. In the winter of 1938, the owner of a French chocolate factory came to Hungary to hunt, accompanied by a secretary and two beautiful young women. Bagić, wearing a handsome uniform, greeted these noble hunters. But when he saw the factory owner in person, he couldn't help but shudder. This capitalist was so thin that he didn't look like a person, as if he would fall down in the wind.
    The secretary told Bagić that his master wanted to shoot a mountain goat the next day. Bagić suggested leaving at dawn, but the secretary said that his master had never gotten out of bed before nine o'clock. Later, it was decided to leave at 9:30 in the morning.
    At the agreed time the next day, the capitalist walked down the stairs with a shotgun on his shoulder. He also gave Bagić a shotgun. Bagić was surprised by the capitalist's generosity, but later he understood that it was for Bagić to shoot for him. It was winter at that time. They went into the forest in a sleigh. The sun shone on the white snow, and the target of the black mountain goat was particularly clear. Bagić led them to the mountainous area where the goats lived. A mountain goat was already standing next to them, but the capitalist hadn't seen it yet. He pointed for the capitalist to fire a shot, but his bullet didn't know where it flew. Bagić also fired a shot, and the mountain goat fell to the ground. Everyone laughed and shouted, saying that the capitalist had hit it. The capitalist also unassumingly admitted it.
    The capitalist and his secretary returned to the manor triumphantly. The Gypsy band played a triumphant tune to welcome them, and the two beautiful girls expressed their infinite warmth and praise to the capitalist.
    In the evening, the capitalist invited Bagić to their sumptuous celebratory dinner. Bagić later learned from the secretary about the capitalist's background. This capitalist divorced his wife at the cost of a house. These two young girls were both candidates for his future wife. He thought that although he couldn't shoot a deer in the Hungarian deer forest, shooting a mountain goat was enough to boast about in front of the women. If he hung the antlers of a deer or the head of a mountain goat on the wall of his fancy dining room, wouldn't his descendants be proud of him?
    European aristocrats and capitalists are willing to pay a high price to come to Gemenc Forest to hunt for this kind of vanity. Once, a Swiss capitalist shot an ordinary five-point deer and paid 200,000 Pengő, an amount that could be used to buy a boat. A few years ago, Western hunters were forbidden to come to Gemenc Forest to hunt because they used the opportunity to hunt to carry out some espionage activities. Last year, due to the easing of the international situation, hunting was permitted again. Last year, seven Western capitalists came, one of whom was from West Germany. He shot a twenty-five-point deer and paid two thousand U.S. dollars. But Bagić still regrets it because this multi-antlered deer was still young and was shot too early. Otherwise, it could have grown to thirty-two antlers, which would have been the most precious deer in Europe.
    After liberation, this place has often received guests from fraternal countries and has become a venue for international friendship and gatherings. Soviet friends even came here to hunt the day before we arrived. Hunting associations have been established in Budapest and other cities. In the past, these were organizations for aristocrats and capitalists, but now they have become clubs for the working people. Hunting is one of the best forms of recreation for restoring fatigue and strengthening the body. The Hungarian people love outdoor sports and are good at shooting. The deer forests of the aristocrats and capitalists of the past are now forests owned by the people. (Photo attached)

    鹿林
    ——匈牙利多尔娜州访问记之三
    本报记者　胡济邦
    离塞克萨特城二十公里的地方，有一个著名的盖门次森林，这里产一种世界名贵的多角鹿。我们离开德吉村时，在村子尽头找到了管理这个森林的负责人巴吉奇老伯。据沙莫什同志的介绍，他是欧洲闻名的一位猎手。他把我们领到第一个狩猎站，然后背上自己的猎枪，登上马车，我们便开始了森林中的旅行。
    这个森林长有五十多公里，宽有十几公里，周围一百二十公里，面积共有一万六千公顷（相当于二十五万六千亩），它是匈牙利最大的一个森林。
    雨后，森林中的空气特别新鲜，但是泥泞的道路使车子颠簸得像一只遇到风浪的小船。多云的天空，透出傍晚的无力的阳光。这时除了沉重的马蹄声和林中的鸟语，什么都听不见了。
    车子转入林中的小道。路旁小树的枝条经常阻挡我们的去路，我们不得不向它们低头弯腰。巴吉奇老伯和马车夫一路上默不作声，也不许我们大声说笑，怕惊动林中的主人。我们穿过许多条小径，快走了一个小时，还是看不见一只鹿，也看不见其他动物。沙莫什同志禁不住低声地说：“我们的老伯没有先向鹿王报一个讯，说明今天有东方的客人前来访问。”司机伊士特万接着说：“据我看来，今天鹿王和它的臣下都被小兔子请去过复活节了，我们来的不是时候。”巴吉奇似乎听到我们的谈话，也插进了一句：“现在是春季生育期，它们都躲在窝里呢。”
    走到一条小路的尽头，外面豁然开朗，那是林中的一片绿草地，是小鹿们的春季餐厅。另有一片草地周围用木栅围起，那是鹿的冬季食堂。此外，在这里还有几块翻耕了的土地，准备播种玉米，供应野兽粮食。
    我们又被两匹骏马拉进林中去，巴吉奇用他挂在胸前的望远镜向四处探望，发现林中有鹿，路旁也有鹿。这时马已放慢脚步，车子平稳地缓缓前进，大家带着一种像孩子们蹑手蹑足地要去抓一个小兔子或扑一只蝴蝶的神情。巴吉奇摘下那顶插着翡翠羽毛的呢帽，向他心中的鹿王行了一个礼，然后用两只手掌围住嘴叫出小鹿的声音，想把前面的两只大鹿引过来。前面站着的大鹿在交头接耳，听到声音后，抬头向我们张望，踌躇了片刻，最后认出是两匹棕色的马向它们迫近的时候，它们就走进树林中去了。
    这里的猎人是鹿的保护者，猎人在春季的工作是巡视新生的小鹿，不让狗熊和野猪吃掉它们。司机伊士特万指着巴吉奇说：“他们像布达佩斯的警察一样，他们狩猎的对象，是动物界里那些残暴的剥削者。”
    我们的目的总算达到了，看到了几只名贵的鹿，盖门次森林中的鹿。大家就谈起巴吉奇老伯的事情。沙莫什同志说：“老伯了解这个森林像了解自己的手掌一样。”巴吉奇听到这句话后，得意地微笑了。“他的父亲也是一位猎手，他从小就跟着父亲打猎，已在森林中度过几十年的生活，他对养鹿特别内行。”巴吉奇接着说：“鹿有一百多种。据他所了解，中国没有匈牙利的这种鹿。它的特点是角长又多，可以多到二十八个到三十二个。鹿角很沉重，名贵就在这里。在匈牙利还没有拿鹿茸来制药，主要是当作一种装饰品。鹿角本身并不值钱，如果把鹿角拿去卖，也卖不出多少钱。”欧洲的传统习惯，射鹿是宫庭贵族们的高尚娱乐。现代的德国、法国、瑞士等国的大资本家也喜欢射鹿。1938年的冬天，一个法国巧克力糖厂的老板来到匈牙利打猎，随行的有一个秘书和二个美貌的年轻姑娘，巴吉奇穿着一身漂亮的制服迎候着这些高贵的猎客。但是当他亲眼看到这位糖厂老板的时候，不禁打了一个寒颤，这个资本家首先瘦得不像个人样，风吹就会倒下似的。
    秘书告诉巴吉奇说，他的主人明天要射一只山羊，巴吉奇建议天一亮就出发，秘书说，他主人从来没有在九点钟以前起过床，后来决定上午九时半出发。
    在第二天约定的时间，资本家从楼梯走下，肩上挂了一枝猎枪，同时也送给巴吉奇一枝猎枪，巴吉奇很奇怪这位资本家的慷慨赠礼，后来才理解到是要巴吉奇替他射击。那时是在冬天。他们坐着雪撬进到森林，太阳照着一片白雪，黑山羊的目标分外显明，巴吉奇把他们带到多山羊的林区，一只山羊已站在旁边，但是资本家还没有看见，他指点资本家放一枪，但他那子弹不知飞向何处去了，巴吉奇也开了一枪，山羊才倒在地下。大家就笑着，叫着，说是资本家打中了，资本家也毫不谦逊地承认了。
    资本家和他的秘书都很得意地回到庄园上，茨冈的乐队奏着凯旋的曲子欢迎着他们，两位漂亮的姑娘向资本家表示无限的温情和赞扬。
    晚上，资本家请巴吉奇参加他们的丰盛的庆祝晚餐。巴吉奇后来从秘书那里才打听到这个资本家的来历，这个资本家以一座房子的代价和妻子离了婚，这两位年轻姑娘都是他的未来的妻子的候选人。他想他在匈牙利的鹿林中虽不能射到一只鹿，但能射到一只山羊也已足够值得在妇女们面前夸耀了。如果把鹿的角或山羊的头挂在自己讲究的餐厅的墙壁上，还可以让他后代的子孙引为骄傲呢？
    欧洲的贵族和资本家们就是为了这种虚荣，愿意付出很高的代价专到盖门次森林来打猎。有一次，一个瑞士的资本家，射到一只普通的五角鹿，付出了二十万朋格，这个数目可以用来买一只船。前几年西方猎客被禁止到盖门次森林中来打猎，因为他们利用打猎的机会，进行过一些间谍活动。去年由于国际形势趋向缓和，打猎又被准许了。去年来过七个西方的资本家，其中一个是西德的，他射到了一只二十五个角的鹿，付出了二千美元。但巴吉奇到现在还感到遗憾，因为这只多角鹿还很年轻，过早被射死了，不然它可能长到三十二个角，那将是欧洲最名贵的一只鹿了。
    解放以后，这里经常接待兄弟国家的客人，它已变成了国际友谊联欢的场所。苏联的朋友在我们来的头一天，还来这里打过猎。布达佩斯和其他城市都设有狩猎协会。过去这是贵族资本家们的组织，现在已成为劳动人民的俱乐部。打猎是恢复疲劳强健身心的最好娱乐之一，匈牙利人民最爱户外运动，也善于射击。过去贵族、资本家的鹿林，现在是人民所有的森林了。　（附图片）
