    Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: The famous French writer Vercors recently returned a Legion of Honor to the French government in protest against the dirty war waged by French colonialists in Algeria.
    He also wrote a letter of protest to the President of France. The letter said: "Protest has become the duty of every citizen, and I am now returning the Legion of Honor to you because it is no longer a symbol of honor. The state has tarnished this honor with shame."

    肮脏战争辱没了法兰西  维尔高尔退回荣誉勋章
    新华社16日讯　法国著名作家维尔高尔不久前把一枚荣誉勋章退给法国政府，以表示他对法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚进行的肮脏战争的抗议。
    他还给法国总统写了一封抗议信。信中说：“抗议已经成为每个公民应有的责任，我现在把荣誉勋章退还给你，因为它再也不是荣誉的代表了。国家使这种荣誉蒙上了耻辱。”
