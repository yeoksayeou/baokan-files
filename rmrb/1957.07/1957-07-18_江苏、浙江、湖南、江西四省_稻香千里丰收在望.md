Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces
	The Scent of Rice Spreads for Miles, a Bountiful Harvest is in Sight
	(Our Report) Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, centered around the fertile Yangtze River Delta, are preparing to welcome a bumper harvest.
	From the coastal plains of southern Zhejiang by the East China Sea to the Yangtze River Delta, and then to the plains of northern Jiangsu by the Yellow Sea, over 17 million mu of early rice is heading and flowering, while intermediate and late rice are also growing and tillering. The summer breeze blows, and green ripples spread across the fields for thousands of miles, the scent of rice intoxicating. In the southern Zhejiang region, Wenzhou Prefecture, where the early rice headed and matured earliest, has begun harvesting successively. The summer harvest and planting will be completed by the end of July. It is estimated that 190,000 mu of double-cropped early rice in Wenling County can yield over 400 jin per mu. Many agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous Wencheng County expect to increase production by 30% to 50%. In the Hang(zhou) Jia(xing) Hu(zhou) Plain and Su(zhou) Song(jiang) Plain in the Yangtze River Delta, double-season early rice has generally been weeded two or three times, and it is expected to begin harvesting in mid to late July. The 180,000 mu of early rice planted in Hang County this year is heading neatly, with 15 to 17 tillers per clump and 70 to 80 grains per panicle. According to farmers in Siwei District of the county, this year's production is expected to increase by 10% to 15%. The 50,000 mu of double-season early rice planted in Jinshan County, Songjiang Prefecture this year was sown and grew earlier than last year, with pure varieties and fewer weeds. The county initially estimates an 8% increase in production compared to last year. The masses generally reflect: double-season rice is double-happiness rice, people have food, and cattle have grass.
	In the mountainous areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Lixiahe area on both sides of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and the Xu(zhou) Huai(yin) Plain, the drought was relieved by welcome rain in early July. Early and mid-season rice are generally growing well and are currently tillering. The Xuhuai Plain in northern Jiangsu has traditionally been dominated by dryland crops. In the past two years, on the basis of agricultural cooperation, "dryland to paddy field" has been implemented in a planned manner, expanding the planting area of paddy fields. Qu Bei’s twenty-one counties planted about 2.5 million mu of rice last year, and this year it has expanded to 4 million mu (including dry rice, direct dry seeding, etc.). Funing County has transformed from a miscellaneous grain county into a "rice county" in recent two years. It is estimated that the 300,000 mu of rice expanded in this county this year can yield 70 jin more grain per mu than planting miscellaneous grains. The rice planting area in Jiangsu Province has expanded to 37 million mu, exceeding any year in history.
	At present, farmers in the rice-growing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are carrying out intensive flood prevention, drainage, small-scale water conservancy construction, and field management, striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year.
	(Our Report) Hunan Province is about to enter the busy farming season of harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice seedlings. Party committees at all levels are taking concrete measures to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture in early July, early and mid-season rice are growing well, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion except for a few areas where the season is later. Late rice and dryland crops such as sweet potatoes have been sown and planted in a timely manner and are now being processed and cultivated. In parts of Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Changde, where insect pests and waterlogging have occurred, local party committees are mobilizing the masses to actively prevent and control these natural disasters.
	In order to harvest early rice in a timely manner and transplant late rice seedlings to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest, party committees and relevant departments at all levels have made full preparations. The CPC committees of Liuyang, Changde and other counties investigated the shortage of labor during the peak of the busy farming season in key communities as early as late June, and found specific ways to comprehensively organize labor and unleash labor potential, and promoted them throughout the county. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also actively organized sources of goods and supplied various means of production needed during the harvest season. The Xiangtan Special Office has called on all counties to carefully harvest and thresh early rice, ensuring that every grain returns home, and to conduct education on increasing production and practicing economy among the broad masses of community members.
	Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: Early rice harvesting has begun in the southern and central regions of Jiangxi Province, and individual counties in the northern region have also begun harvesting. News of bumper harvests continues to pour in. Many agricultural cooperatives that have increased production are taking gift boxes filled with new grain or new rice to local Party and government organs to report the good news, expressing their gratitude for the leadership of the Party and the government.
	According to the materials currently reported by various special districts and counties to the provincial agricultural departments, the total output of early rice in Jiangxi Province this year will be slightly higher or not lower than the bumper harvest of 1956. The total output of early rice last year was 5.7 billion jin.

    江苏、浙江、湖南、江西四省
    稻香千里  丰收在望
    本报讯  以富饶的长江三角洲为中心的江苏、浙江两省，正在迎接丰收。
    从东海之滨的浙南平原到长江三角洲，再到黄海之滨的苏北平原，一千七百多万亩早稻正在抽穗扬花，中晚稻也在发棵分蘖。夏风吹来，田野里绿色的涟漪相传千里，稻香沁人欲醉。在浙南地区，早稻抽穗结实最早的温州专区已陆续开镰收割，7月底可完成夏收夏种。温岭县十九万亩连作早稻，估计每亩可收四百斤以上。山区文成县不少农业社，预计能增产三至五成。在长江三角洲的杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原和苏（州）松（江）平原，双季早稻已普遍耘趟两三遍，预计7月中下旬可以开镰收割。杭县今年种植的十八万亩早稻抽穗整齐，每兜发棵十五到十七株，每穗有七、八十粒。据这个县四维区农民估计，今年可增产一成到一成五。松江专区金山县今年种的五万亩双季早稻，比去年早播、早发，品种纯，杂草少。全县初步估计比去年增产8％。群众普遍反映：双季稻是双喜稻，人有口粮、牛有草。
    在江浙山区、苏北灌溉总渠两岸的里下河地区和徐（州）淮（阴）平原上，7月初喜雨，旱象解除。早中稻一般发棵较好，正在发棵分蘖。江苏北部徐淮平原历年以种旱粮为主，近两年来在农业合作化的基础上有计划地实行了“旱改水”，扩大了稻田种植面积。渠北二十一个县去年种稻约为二百五十万亩，今年扩大到四百万亩（包括旱稻、旱直播等）。阜宁县近二年来已由杂粮县变成“水稻县”。这个县今年扩种的三十万亩水稻，预计每亩可比种杂粮多收七十斤粮食。江苏全省水稻种植面积已扩大到三千七百万亩，超过了历史上任何一年。
    目前，江浙两省稻区农民正在进行紧张的防汛排涝、兴修小型水利和田间管理工作，力争全年丰收。
    本报讯  湖南省即将进入收早稻、插晚秧的紧张农忙季节。各级党委正在采取具体措施，争取全面丰收。据省农业厅在7月上旬统计，全省早稻、中稻生长良好，除少数季节较迟地区外，丰收已成定局。晚稻和红薯等旱土作物，都适时播种和栽种，现在正在加工培育。在邵阳、衡阳、常德等部分发生虫害与渍水的地区，当地党委正在发动群众积极防治这些自然灾害。
    为了及时收好早稻，插好晚秧争取全面丰收，各地党委和有关部门都进行了充分的准备工作。中共浏阳、常德等县委，早在6月下旬就在重点社调查在大农忙中劳动力不足的情况，并找出了全面组织劳动力、发挥劳动潜力的具体办法，在全县推广。各地供销社也积极组织货源，供应收获季节中需要的各种生产资料。湘潭专署已号召各县在收割早稻中要细收细打、颗粒还家，向广大社员进行增产节约教育。
    据新华社南昌16日电  江西省南部和中部地区开始收割早稻，北部也有个别县已经开镰。丰收喜讯不断传来，许多增产的农业社社员拿着装有新谷或新米的礼盒到当地党政机关报喜，表示感激党和政府的领导。
    根据目前各专、县向省农业部门报告的材料，今年江西省早稻总产量将稍高或不低于丰收的1956年。去年早稻的总产量是五十七亿斤。
