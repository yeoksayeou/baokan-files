    Recalling Today Twenty Years Ago
    He Jifeng
      After the "September 18th Incident," due to the Kuomintang government's policy of non-resistance, Japanese imperialism quickly seized our country's northeastern provinces. The North China region, due to its geographical location, became the primary target of intensified Japanese aggression. At this time, the Kuomintang government had effectively abandoned North China and was forced to hand over this fragmented and chaotic land to the "miscellaneous troops" they had always discriminated against—the Twenty-Ninth Army—for defense.
    The Twenty-Ninth Army was originally part of Feng Yuxiang's old Northwest Army and had fought fiercely against the Japanese army at Xifengkou in the spring of 1933, possessing a certain degree of combat effectiveness. Since taking control of the provinces of Hebei and Chahar and the cities of Beiping and Tianjin, the Twenty-Ninth Army had become somewhat more active financially. It purchased military equipment from abroad to replenish its strength and expanded the authorized strength of its original four divisions. In addition, it added several brigades, nominally as local troops. All of this undoubtedly posed a threat to the Japanese army.
    At that time, I was a brigade commander in the Twenty-Ninth Army, belonging to the Thirty-Seventh Division. The division headquarters and my brigade headquarters were both located in Xiyuan. Due to the appeasement of Japan in North China, it was clear that the situation would not last long, and sooner or later there would be a war. We made preparations for defense and constructed fortifications. In March 1937, I, along with a delegation led by Zhang Zizhong (commander of the Thirty-Eighth Division of the Twenty-Ninth Army and mayor of Tianjin), visited Japan. This was a deliberate act by Japanese imperialism to intimidate our country. At that time, we saw that in Japan, ordinary factories had military representatives stationed in them, and all military factories were operating day and night. When we returned to Beiping in early May, we saw the tense situation of the Japanese army, and everyone felt that war was imminent.
    At this time, the Japanese army had a brigade stationed in the Tianjin-Beiping area, with one regiment stationed in Fengtai. The so-called "Commander of the North China Garrison Army" was stationed in Tianjin, commanding all Japanese troops in North China. The commander was Lieutenant General Tadashi. On July 5th, the Japanese army conducted exercises from Fengtai to Changxindian, requesting to pass through Wanping County (located at the Lugou Bridge). Our army refused, and after a half-day standoff, the Japanese army detoured outside the city. On the 6th, I received a report from our army stationed in Fengtai stating that the Japanese army was conducting exercises outside the city with ammunition loaded in their guns, which was different from ordinary exercises. Our army immediately prepared for battle. The Japanese army then used the excuse of a missing Japanese soldier who had entered the city to demand entry into Wanping County to search, which our army resolutely refused. At dawn on the 7th, the Japanese army bombarded the county seat, and infantry advanced to the base of the city wall. The 219th Regiment of my brigade, which was responsible for defending the city, immediately returned fire. The Japanese army did not expect our army to dare to counterattack and suffered heavy casualties. The next day, the Japanese army stopped attacking the city and requested negotiations. From the 10th to the 15th, they attacked the city several times but were repelled by our army. After the 17th, they again requested negotiations. During these negotiations, the Japanese army transferred reinforcements from outside Shanhaiguan. Once the troops were assembled, they attacked again. Japanese commander Tadashi rode a horse to Fengtai to inspect the positions and was shot by our army. Soon after, the "Guanganmen Incident" occurred in Beiping. At night, the Japanese army requested to pass through Guanganmen from outside the city to enter the city, but our army stopped them, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. At Langfang Railway Station, the Japanese army attacked our army again. Matsui, the head of the Japanese special affairs agency, issued an ultimatum to Song Zheyuan, demanding the withdrawal of the 37th Division troops from Babaoshan, or immediate action would be taken. Song refused, and the war broke out and expanded again.
      After July 7th, the morale of our army was high. On the night of the 10th, a company of our army at Lugou Bridge was able to repel nine Japanese tanks. There were many similar events. In addition, the help of the workers and peasants also played a significant role. Wanping County, at the Lugou Bridge, was heavily bombarded by dozens of Japanese cannons but was never breached, which was due to the support of the railway workers in Changxindian. Several months prior, our army had hollowed out the bottom of the city walls, and the Changxindian railway workers had transported sleepers, iron plates, and rails to help our army build solid fortifications. When the war broke out, our army immediately entered the fortifications, preventing the Japanese artillery from exerting its power. The peasant brothers, unafraid of danger, actively and eagerly helped transport ammunition and food, and carried the wounded and medicine, which gave our army tremendous support and encouragement.
    On July 30th, due to the Kuomintang government's policy of non-resistance, I led my troops to Changxindian and, in the evening, withdrew the troops from Wanping City. At that time, Wanping City was completely silent. The people watched the retreating soldiers with suspicion and fear, and the soldiers left the city in tears. The entire army marched towards Baoding, and from then on, the Chinese people's heroic War of Resistance Against Japan began in full swing.

    回忆二十年前的今天
    何基沣
      “九一八”事变后，由于国民党政府采取不抵抗政策，使日本帝国主义迅速地攫取了我国东北各省。华北地方，由于地理的关系，就首先成为日军加紧侵略的目标了。这时，国民党政府事实上已经放弃了华北，被迫将这一片破碎混乱的土地，交给他们向来歧视的“杂牌队伍”——第二十九军来防守。
    第二十九军是原来冯玉祥所部的旧西北军的一部分，曾经在1933年春天，在喜峰口和日军打过死仗，有一定的战斗力。二十九军自从管辖了冀察两省和平津两市以后，财政方面，活动些了，它从国外购买军火来补充实力，又把原有四个师的编制人数扩大了些，此外又增编了几个旅，名义上作为地方部队。这一切对于日军来说，无疑地，是一种威胁。
    我当时是二十九军的一个旅长，属于第三十七师，师部和我的旅部都设在西苑，由于华北对日妥协的局面，显然不会维持长久，迟早总有一战，我们做了准备应战的工作和修筑防御的工事。在1937年的3月中，我同张自忠（二十九军的三十八师师长兼天津市市长）所率领的代表团去日本参观，这是日本帝国主义特意安排的一种向我国威吓的行动。当时，我们看到日本国内一般的工厂都已经派有驻厂的军事代表，而所有的军事工厂，也都昼夜开工。5月初我们回到北平，又看见日军剑拔弩张的情况，大家都感觉到战事就会一触即发了。
    此时日军在平津一带，驻有一个旅团，其中一个联队驻在丰台，所谓“华北驻屯军司令官”则驻在天津，指挥华北的全部日军，司令官为田代中将。7月5日，日军由丰台到长辛店演习，要求穿过宛平县城（就在芦沟桥头），我军不许，相持了半天，日军才绕道城外回去。6日我接到驻在丰台的我军的报告，说日军今日出外演习，枪炮都配备了弹药，和普通的演习情况不同，我军即准备应战。日军又借口有一个日兵进城失踪，要求进入宛平县城搜查，我军坚决予以拒绝。7日拂晓，日军向县城开炮，步兵逼进城根，担任守城的我旅第二一九团立即予以还击，日军没有想到我军竟敢反击，伤亡甚多。第二天日军不攻城了，要求讲和。10日至15日又几次攻城，都被我军击退，17日以后又要求讲和。就在几次讲和期间，日军从山海关外调队增援，到部队调齐，又来进攻，日军田代司令官乘马到丰台视察阵地，被我军击中。不久，北平又发生了“广安门事件”，日军在夜间由城外要求通过广安门进城，我军加以阻止，双方发生了冲突。在廊坊车站，日军又向我军进攻。日军特务机关长松井向宋哲元提出最后通牒，要求撤退八宝山的三十七师部队，否则立即行动，宋予以拒绝，战事就又爆发扩大了。
      “七七”开始后，我军士气旺盛，10日夜间，在芦沟桥的我军一连，竟能击退九辆日军坦克车，这样类似的事还很多。此外，工农群众的帮助，也起着很大的作用。芦沟桥头的宛平县城，被日军数十门大炮猛轰，始终没有攻破，就是得力于长辛店铁路工人的支援。我军早在几个月以前，就把城墙下边挖空，长辛店铁路工人弟兄们运来枕木铁板和铁轨，帮助我军筑成坚固的阵地，等到战事爆发后，我军立即进入阵地，使日军大炮无法发挥威力。农民弟兄们不怕危险，主动地争先恐后，帮同运输弹药、食物，抬送伤兵、药品，这些都给了我军以莫大的支援和鼓励。
    7月30日终因国民党政府的不抵抗政策，我率领部队到达长辛店，晚间撤退了宛平城内的部队。当时宛平城一片死寂，老百姓惊疑地望着撤退的士兵，士兵们也都洒泪离城，全军向保定进发，从此中国人民英勇的抗日战争全面开始。
