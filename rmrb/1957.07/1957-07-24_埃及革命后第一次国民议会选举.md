    The First National Assembly Election After the Egyptian Revolution
    Chen Bojian
    The first National Assembly of Egypt after the revolution held its inaugural ceremony on July 22. A total of 344 members were elected in the voting held on July 3 and 14. The current National Assembly has a total of 350 seats, and six seats have not yet been elected. These six seats will be elected after the parliament takes office.
    The Egyptian people regard this election as a very important event, because it is the first universal suffrage held in Egypt since it truly got rid of foreign rule. On the night of the voting day, July 3, Cairo was almost a city that never sleeps, and people were still celebrating the election late into the night.
    This election was organized quite well. On a national scale, the election proceeded calmly, and only a few voter conflict incidents occurred in a few places.
    Several thousand polling stations were set up in 350 electoral districts across the country. Each polling station had 600 to 800 voters, and was presided over by a committee, which was led by the electoral district committee. Voters lined up outside the door and entered the polling station in order to exchange their voter ID for a ballot. The ballot printed specific symbols in front of each candidate's name to represent each candidate, such as camels, palm trees, the moon, etc. In the election campaign, voters were already familiar with these symbols. Therefore, illiterate people only need to mark the symbol without asking someone to write the ballot for them.
    The restrictions and review of candidates' qualifications in the Egyptian election have caused controversy among Egyptian and foreign observers.
    In addition to the restrictions on candidates commonly seen in the political life of various countries, Egypt also has the following restrictions: former members of the royal family, former party leaders, and former heads of government are not allowed to participate in the election, and those who have been arrested, subjected to control, or subjected to other types of criminal sanctions after 1952 are not allowed to participate in the election. At the same time, the "National Alliance" has the final say on the qualifications of candidates. After the end of candidate registration, the "National Alliance" cancelled the qualifications of more than 1,100 people.
    The reporter talked to some people who are very influential in Egyptian public opinion about this issue. They believe that in order to understand the background of restricting candidates' qualifications, the current international and domestic environment in Egypt must be taken into account. They pointed out that imperialists have been trying every means to undermine Egypt's national independence. In addition to using political and economic pressure, provoking Egypt's relations with other Arab countries, etc., they also attempted to carry out subversive activities from within through their agents in Egypt. The Egyptian state power, after the struggle against the British, French, and Israeli aggression last year, proved to be consolidated, but it was also discovered that some former Wafd Party members and former Muslim Brotherhood members repeatedly carried out activities aimed at subverting the Egyptian government under the instigation of imperialism. In the early stages of the election campaign, some candidates who were very active at the time obtained huge amounts of campaign funds from the United States. These people said that the Egyptian government cannot allow parliamentary elections to be used by reactionaries and imperialists, and therefore had to restrict the qualifications of candidates.
    The reporter has participated in several election rallies. The mood of these rallies was very enthusiastic, and they often did not end until after midnight. The candidate himself or his supporters gave enthusiastic speeches at such rallies, and the masses responded to them with warm applause and slogans. These election rallies all talked about the candidate's contribution to the cause of defending peace, to the struggle against imperialism, especially against British and French aggression and the Eisenhower Doctrine, and expressed their desire to work for the construction of domestic economic life, for neutralism, Arab nationalism and the unity of Arab countries. All candidates must use these slogans to win over voters, which reflects the general sentiment of the Egyptian people.
    The family rule in the Egyptian countryside is a major obstacle to the development of democratic life in rural areas. It cannot be hoped that this obstacle will be eliminated in this election. There, one or two large families often hereditarily control the basic administrative positions in rural areas (called Amda, equivalent to the township head in our country). In addition to their own families, they also control the economy of local farmers. Whoever the main figures of the family think should be elected, that member of parliament is considered to be determined. Only in the case where there is more than one family in an electoral district will there be an election, but this is only a competition between several families. This competition is sometimes very fierce. On election day, sixteen people in an electoral district in Upper Egypt died in a conflict between two feuding families. Both families demanded to enter the polling station first to vote.
    For the first time in Egyptian history, women have the right to vote and to be elected. There were five female candidates. Two women were elected as members of parliament. The election of women as members of parliament is unprecedented in all Arab countries. Many Egyptian women value their rights very much. A farmer in a certain place asked the election committee to go to his home to accept his wife's vote, because she had just given birth and could not go to the polling station to vote. The female voters we saw were also exercising their rights with excitement and seriousness.
    However, the issue of women in Egypt is still a very complicated issue, and the traditional forces that discriminate against women are still very strong. Many men do not allow their wives to register, and some women are also affected by the traditional concept of underestimating women, so there are very few registered female voters. Among the registered female voters, who many people vote for is also controlled by their parents and husbands. Government decrees also have different requirements for male and female voters. Male voters will be punished for not voting, and female voters will not be punished for not voting.
    We attended a campaign rally for female candidate Qisa Nabalawi. She is the Vice President of the International Democratic Women's Federation and the Chairman of the Egyptian Women's Federation. She has been engaged in social activities for more than 30 years and is very prestigious in Egypt and internationally. Her constituency is in Old Cairo, which is the area with the strongest traditional concepts. When Qisa Nabalawi's supporters spoke, someone rudely shouted that according to our tradition, a woman can only be counted as half a person. A woman stood up and gave a speech refuting this statement. She was so excited that her face turned red and her body leaned towards the audience, almost knocking over the microphone. When other people who supported the female candidate spoke, opponents and people who discriminated against women kept arguing at the meeting, and the meeting could hardly continue. This rally for a female candidate with nearly a thousand people present had less than twenty women present. Some women hid outside the venue or on the balconies of nearby buildings, unwilling to come in. Although many people in this constituency loved Qisa Nabalawi very much, she still lost the election. A voter's conversation shows the strength of traditional concepts. He said: "Qisa is a good person, but we can't vote for her because she is a woman."
    The Egyptian National Assembly election was successfully completed. Observers here believe that the future National Assembly will not make any significant changes to Egypt's basic domestic and foreign policies. The upcoming National Assembly will be an important step forward in Egypt's political life after the revolution, and the democratic life of the Egyptian people will gradually develop and improve.

    埃及革命后第一次国民议会选举
    陈伯坚
    埃及革命后的第一届国民议会已在7月22日举行就职典礼。在7月3日和14日举行的投票中，总共选出了三百四十四个议员。本届国民议会总共有三百五十个议席，有六个议席还没有选出。这六个议席将在议会就职以后再行选举。
    埃及人民把这次选举看作很重大的事件。因为这是埃及有史以来真正摆脱了外国的统治以后举行的第一次普选。7月3日投票日晚上，开罗几乎成了不夜的城市，人们直到深夜还在欢庆这次选举。
    这次选举组织得相当好，就全国范围来说，选举的进行是平静的，只有少数地方发生了选民冲突事件。
    在全国三百五十个选区中共设立了几千个投票站。每一个投票站有六百到八百人投票，由一个委员会来主持，这个委员会又受选区的委员会领导。选民在门外排好队，依次进入投票站，以选民证换取选票。选票上在每一位候选人名字前面印有特定的代表各该候选人的记号，例如骆驼、棕树、月亮等。在竞选活动中，选民们早已熟悉了这些记号，因此，不识字的人，只要在记号上划一下就可以了，不必请人代写选票。
    埃及选举中对候选人资格的限制和审查，曾经引起埃及和外国观察家的争论。
    埃及对候选人的限制除了目前在各国政治生活中所习见的以外，还有：不许前皇族、前党派首领和前政府首脑参加竞选，不许在1952年以后曾经被逮捕、管制以及受过其他若干种刑事处分的人参加竞选。同时，“民族联盟”对候选人的资格有最后决定权，在候选人登记结束以后，“民族联盟”曾经取消了一千一百多人的候选人资格。
    记者曾经同一些在埃及舆论界很有地位的人士谈到这个问题。他们认为要了解对候选人资格加以限制的背景，必须考虑到埃及目前的国际国内环境。他们指出，帝国主义者一直在千方百计地企图破坏埃及的民族独立，它们除了用政治、经济压力，挑拨埃及同其他阿拉伯国家的关系等等手段外，还企图通过它们在埃及的代理人从内部进行颠覆活动。埃及的国家政权经过去年反抗英、法、以色列侵略的斗争，证明是巩固的，但是也发现了一些前华夫脱党分子和前穆斯林兄弟会分子在帝国主义的指使下，屡次进行旨在颠覆埃及政府的活动。在竞选运动的初期，某些当时十分活跃的候选人从美国方面获得了巨额的竞选活动经费。这些人士说，埃及政府不能容许议会选举被反动分子和帝国主义所利用，因此不得不对候选人资格加以限制。
    记者曾经参加过几次竞选的集会，这些集会的情绪是很热烈的，常常到半夜以后才散。候选人本人或他的支持者在这样的集会上发表热情的演说，群众则以热烈的鼓掌和口号来响应他们。这些竞选集会都谈到候选人在保卫和平事业，在反对帝国主义、特别是反对英法侵略和艾森豪威尔主义的斗争中的贡献，都表示要为建设国内经济生活，为中立主义、阿拉伯民族主义和阿拉伯国家的团结而努力。所有的候选人都必须以这些口号来争取选民，这正反映了埃及人民的普遍情绪。
    埃及农村中的家族统治是发展农村民主生活的大障碍。这个障碍不能希望在这次选举中就被破除。在那里，常常是一两个大家族世袭地控制着农村基层行政职务（称为阿姆达，相当于我国的乡长），他们除了本家族外，还控制着当地农民的经济。家族的主要人物认为应该选谁，那里的议员就算是已经确定了。只有在一个选区内有一个以上的家族的情形下，才会有竞选，但这也只是几个家族之间的竞争。这种竞争有时是很激烈的。在选举日，上埃及一个选区有十六个人死于两个有世仇的家族之间的冲突。这两个家族都要求首先进入投票站去投票。
    妇女在埃及历史上第一次得到选举权和被选举权，候选人中有五位妇女。有两人当选为议员。妇女当选为议员在所有的阿拉伯国家中都是前所未有的。许多埃及妇女非常重视他们的权利，某地一个农民要求选举委员会到他家里去接受他妻子的选票，因为她刚生了孩子，不能到投票站来投票。我们所看到的女选民也都在很兴奋和严肃地行使她们的权利。
    但是妇女问题在埃及依然是一个很复杂的问题，歧视妇女的传统力量还很强固。许多男子不允许他们的妻子登记，有些妇女自己也受轻视妇女的传统观念的影响，所以登记的女选民是很少的。在已登记的女选民中，许多人的选票将投给谁，也受到她们的家长和丈夫的控制。政府法令对男女选民的要求也不同。男选民不参加投票要受罚，女选民不参加投票不受罚。
    我们参加过女候选人齐萨·娜巴拉薇的竞选集会。她是国际民主妇联的副主席，埃及妇联主席。她从事社会活动三十多年，在埃及和国际上都很有威望。她的选区在老开罗，这是传统观念最浓厚的地区。齐萨·娜巴拉薇的支持者讲话的时候，有人无礼嚷叫说，按照我们的传统，女人只能算是半个人。一位妇女起来发表演说，驳斥这种说法，她激动得脸孔通红，身子倾向听众，几乎把麦克风推倒。别的支持女候选人的人讲话时，反对者、歧视妇女的人在会场吵嚷不休，这个集会几乎无法继续下去。这个有近千人参加的为女候选人竞选的集会，却只有不到二十个妇女在场，有些女人躲在场外或附近楼房的阳台上，不肯进来。尽管在这个选区有很多人很爱戴齐萨·娜巴拉薇，但是她还是落选了。从一个选民的谈话可以看出传统观念的强固，他说：“齐萨是好人，但我们不能选她，因为她是个女人。”
    埃及国民议会选举胜利地完成了。这里的观察家认为：未来的国民议会不会使埃及的内外基本政策有任何重要的改变。即将组成的国民议会将是埃及在革命后的政治生活中前进的一个重要的步骤，埃及人民的民主生活将逐步发展并健全起来。
