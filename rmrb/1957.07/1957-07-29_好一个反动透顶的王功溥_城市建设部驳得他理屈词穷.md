Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: The staff of the Civil Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Urban Construction have recently held a series of debates to expose and refute the reactionary remarks of rightist technician Wang Gongpu. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, he put forward a so-called "Sixteen Articles of Opinion," in which he slandered the leadership of the Communist Party as "the Party's world." Therefore, he wanted to rise up to "rebel against the Communist Party" and carried out incitement, calling on all those with counter-revolutionary viewpoints to "openly express counter-revolutionary viewpoints." He said that what the people considered "counter-revolutionary, I consider revolutionary." He also said that the viewpoints in the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng's "Ten Thousand Word Letter" were the same as his own, so he would go to visit Hu Feng and "seek justice" for Hu Feng.

Wang Gongpu openly spread rumors saying: "An event similar to the Hungarian incident is about to happen in China," and claimed that "if a Hungarian incident happens in China, I will be an active participant." He also said that he would first kill a Communist Youth League branch secretary from the former Tongji University.

In these debates, Wang Gongpu initially resorted to cunning sophistry regarding the series of reactionary remarks he had made. Later, under the righteous and stern refutation of the masses, he was at a loss for words, and then resorted to relying on substitutes for debate, scolding those who criticized him, saying that everyone's criticism of him was "not worth listening to," and shamelessly threatened people, saying that if he were to be sent for labor reform, he would "kill ten people first."

The reactionary remarks of rightist Wang Gongpu, who persisted in his reactionary stance and hated the people, aroused the boundless indignation of the staff of this ministry. Now, all the staff of the ministry are further exposing and refuting his reactionary words and deeds.

    好一个反动透顶的王功溥  城市建设部驳得他理屈词穷
    据新华社26日讯　城市建设部民用建筑设计院的工作人员，最近连续举行辩论会，揭发和驳斥右派分子技术员王功溥的反动言论。开始整风时，他就提出了所谓“十六条意见”书，在这个意见书里，他诬蔑共产党的领导是“党天下”，因此他要起来“革共产党的命”，并进行煽动，号召一切有反革命观点的人“大放反革命观点”，他说人民群众认为的“反革命，我认为是革命”。他还说反革命分子胡风的“万言书”里的观点和他的论点一样，因此他要去拜见胡风，为胡风“伸冤”。
    王功溥公然造谣说：“类似匈牙利事件要在中国发生”，并声称“如果中国发生匈牙利事件，我是积极参加的一分子”。他还说他要首先杀掉原同济大学的一个共青团支部书记。
    在这些辩论会上，王功溥开始对他发表的一系列的反动言论，狡猾诡辩，后来在群众义正词严的驳斥下，他理屈词穷，就以赖代辩，谩骂批判他的人，说大家对他的批判“不值一听”，并无耻地威胁人们说，如果要让他劳动改造，他就要“先杀十个人”。
    右派分子王功溥坚持反动立场，仇视人民群众的言论，激起了这个部的工作人员的无比愤慨。现在，部的全体工作人员，正进一步揭露和驳斥他的反动言行。
