    Questioning the Bourgeois Right-Wing Gentlemen
    When the people's armed forces, loyal and devoted, are performing the sacred task of defending the people, why do you think they would come to "suppress" you? Is it because you are determined to be reactionary to the end and resolutely act as enemies of the people?
    
    Chen Mingren's Speech
    I completely agree with the reports made to the congress by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, President Dong, Procurator-General Zhang, and Vice Chairman Peng.
    
    I would like to express my opinions on the anti-rightist struggle as a revolutionary soldier and an uprising general.
    
    I come from the frontier of the motherland. The Chinese Communist Party organization in the armed forces where I serve is conducting a rectification movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission on the rectification movement. It is foreseeable that the smooth progress of the rectification movement will further improve the relationship between officers and soldiers, the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and the relationship between the military and the people within the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It will further enhance the political quality and combat strength of the troops. Our officers and soldiers, while vigilantly performing their task of defending the motherland's borders, are also closely watching the socio-political dynamics of our country. We express great anger at the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds of the bourgeois right-wing.
    
    The bourgeois right-wing took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement and the pretext of "great blooming and great contending" to viciously slander and defame the Party and socialism. Their sinister aim was to discredit and overthrow the Communist Party in order to replace it and realize their daydream of restoring the capitalist system. They estimated: the situation is very bad, the Communist Party cannot take it back, if they take it back they will lose the people's hearts; "It is easy to take it back, three million troops can take it back, but the hearts of the people are gone, and the Party's prestige among the masses is gone" (费孝通 Fei Xiaotong's words); since it cannot be taken back, and the army cannot be used, therefore they have to let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go until it's completely rotten, the Communist Party issues a "decree of self-reproach," the "masses" do not agree, and finally they are asked to clean up the mess. This assessment of the situation by the bourgeois right-wing first of all puts themselves in a hostile position to the Party and the cause of socialism. Therefore, they cannot but become figures "watched by ten eyes and pointed at by ten fingers," and their shameful attack will undoubtedly suffer a shameful defeat. As a commander of the people's army, I want to solemnly warn the bourgeois right-wing gentlemen: our people's army is to defend peaceful labor, to defend the cause of socialist construction, to defend mothers and children, and is prepared to meet the enemy's invasion. When such a loyal and devoted people's armed force is performing the sacred task of defending the people, why do you bourgeois right-wing gentlemen think that they will come to "suppress" you? Is it because you have long made up your mind to be reactionary to the end, to sabotage the cause of socialism, to violate the law, and to resolutely become enemies of the people? Is it because you are hotheaded, overestimating your own strength, thinking that the Communist Party can't do anything to you, and can only throw out the "trump card" of the gun at the end? Is it because you underestimate the strength of the Party and the people, underestimate the awareness of the people, and think that it is impossible to defeat you on the political front and the ideological front except with guns? Now, the miasma has dissipated, and the bourgeois right-wing gentlemen have retreated after only one round of fighting, and hung up the sign of no-war (the struggle between the two roads on the political and ideological fronts is quite long-term, but in this round, the bourgeois right-wing is destined to lose). The lesson is indeed tragic enough. When the bourgeois right-wing gentlemen are a little cooler-headed, and look back at their so-called assessment of the situation, they should know that they are truly foolish and absurd.
    
    I spent my entire youth and middle age in the old army. In those days, I actually did not have a clear political goal. When I was carrying out so-called "orders" to engage in counter-revolutionary war, I thought I was "serving the country and the people." Decades of nightmares did not suddenly awaken until the peaceful uprising and surrender to the people in 1949. The peaceful uprising, from darkness to light, from counter-revolution to revolution, from anti-people to people, this is the turning point of my new life. The Communist Party saved me, the Communist Party educated me, made me understand many principles, and enabled me to devote my energy to the magnificent cause of socialist construction. My parents gave me life, and the Communist Party gave me new life. I can never forget the Communist Party in my whole life. Therefore, I cannot understand the despicable acts of the bourgeois right-wing gentlemen (they were all rescued by the Communist Party!). I am angry! I want to question the bourgeois right-wing gentlemen: why are you so mad? Why are you so ungrateful and unappreciative? Why are you so ungrateful, repaying kindness with enmity, and launching a frenzied attack on the Party and the cause of socialism? People without conscience, why are you like this? Have you forgotten your own sinful and blood-stained history of the first half of your life? Are you playing the role of "anti-communist heroes" and "anti-socialist heroes" today, forgetting the history from 1927 to 1949, and do you not feel the danger?
    
    The bourgeois right-wing gentlemen like to make a fuss about the Communist Party's sectarianism, and they even put forward the fallacy of "the Party's world." They believe that the "three evils" are the product of the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. Their logic is: since the Communist Party exists, sectarianism exists, therefore, in order to completely oppose sectarianism, the Communist Party must be fundamentally opposed. This is the whole untold secret of why they are so keen on the issue of sectarianism. In my opinion, in fact, the Communist Party and sectarianism are absolutely incompatible. The reason why some Communist Party members are infected with the habits of sectarianism is only because they have been eroded and influenced by bourgeois ideas. The Communist Party's initiative to launch the rectification movement proves that the Communist Party is the mortal enemy of sectarianism. Are the sectarian habits that some Communist Party members are infected with serious? Not serious. Can it be overcome? Absolutely. The People's Army is a fighting collective that maintains the absolute leadership of the Communist Party. If it is said that there is sectarianism within the People's Army, it is most easily manifested in the arrangement and treatment of uprising officers and soldiers. I am an uprising general. For eight years, I have been working in the army. I have not felt the pressure of sectarianism. In the short term, on some specific issues, although some negative phenomena of sectarianism have also appeared, however, based on a responsible spirit, a sincere attitude, and starting from the desire for unity, I actively put forward opinions, and these negative phenomena disappeared. I am now working very happily. I deeply feel the correctness of the Party's policy of "striving for, uniting, transforming, and educating" uprising personnel and the great achievements that have been made in implementing this policy. On the eve of my departure from the army, the Party Committee of our troops convened a symposium with a wide representation of uprising personnel for several days. At the symposium, everyone unanimously affirmed the wisdom and correctness of the Party's policy towards uprising personnel. They wanted to send a telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to express their gratitude, and they also wanted me to express their gratitude to the People's Government and the people of the whole country to the National People's Congress. This powerfully shows that the resolute implementation of the policy towards uprising personnel guarantees that the People's Army overcomes sectarianism in a very important aspect; and the resolute implementation of other policies guarantees that the People's Army overcomes possible sectarianism in other aspects. The People's Army can do this, what reason, on what basis, can it be said that the Communist Party cannot overcome the sectarianism existing in schools, factories, and governments through the rectification movement? What do the arguments of calling for "Party committees to withdraw from schools," "public representatives to withdraw from joint state-private enterprises," and "Party groups to withdraw from government agencies and mass organizations" mean, "Sima Zhao's intention is known to all," there is really no need to explain it any further.
    
    Fellow delegates: I bring to this conference the enthusiasm of our troops and soldiers in the anti-rightist struggle. I shout with the same enthusiasm of our troops and soldiers:
    
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live socialism!

    质问资产阶级右派老爷们
    赤胆忠心的人民武装部队正在执行着保卫人民的神圣任务的时候，你们为什么会想到他们会来“镇压”你们？是不是你们一定要反动到底，坚决作人民的敌人呢？
    陈明仁的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、董院长、张检察长和彭副委员长向大会所作的报告。
    我想以一个革命军人、起义将领的身份，对反右派斗争发表一点意见。
    我从祖国的边防前线来，在我服务的武装部队里的中国共产党组织，按照中共中央、中央军委总政治部关于整风运动的指示，正在有计划地、有步骤地开展整风运动。可以预料，整风运动的顺利开展，将进一步改善中国人民解放军内部的官兵关系、上下级关系和军民关系，将进一步提高部队的政治素质和战斗力量。我们的官兵，在警惕地执行着自己的保卫祖国边防的任务的同时，还密切地注视着我们国家的社会政治动态。我们对资产阶级右派的反共、反人民、反社会主义的言行，表示莫大的愤怒。
    资产阶级右派利用共产党整风的机会，利用“大放大鸣”的借口，向党、向社会主义进行恶毒的诬蔑和诽谤，他们的阴险目的，是想把共产党搞臭搞垮，以便取而代之，实现资本主义制度复辟的白昼梦。他们估计：形势非常不妙，共产党不能收，收了要丧失人心；“要收也容易，三百万军队就可以收，但人心是去了，党在群众中的威信也就完了”（费孝通语）；既不能收，又不能用军队，因此只好放，放，放，放得稀烂，共产党下“罪己诏”，“群众”不答应，最后请他们来收拾局面。资产阶级右派对形势的这种估计，是首先把他们自己置身于党和社会主义事业的敌对立场上面。因此他们就不能不成为“十目所视、十手所指”的人物，他们的可耻进攻，就毫无疑问地会遭受可耻的失败。作为一个人民军队的指挥官，我要正告资产阶级右派老爷们：我们人民的军队是保卫和平劳动的，是保卫社会主义建设事业的，是保卫母亲和孩子的，是准备着迎击敌人侵略的。这样赤胆忠心的人民武装部队，正在执行着保卫人民的神圣任务的时候，你们资产阶级右派老爷们为什么会想到他们会来“镇压”你们呢？是不是你们早就安下了心，一定要反动到底，破坏社会主义事业，触犯刑律，坚决作人民的敌人呢？是不是你们头脑发热，把自己的声势估计得过大，以为共产党拿你们没办法，只好最后抛出枪杆子这张“王牌”呢？是不是你们把党和人民的力量估计得过小，把人民的觉悟估计得过低，除了枪杆子以外，就不可能在政治战线上、思想战线上战胜你们呢？现在，乌烟瘴气已经消散，资产阶级右派老爷们只战了一个回合就鸣金收兵，挂出了免战牌（政治战线上和思想战线上的两条道路的斗争是相当长期的，不过这一回合资产阶级右派是输定了）。教训的确是够悲惨的，资产阶级右派老爷们在头脑稍微清凉一些的时候，回过头来再想想自己的所谓对形势的估计，就应当晓得自己真正是愚不可及、荒谬绝伦了。
    我在旧军队里消磨了自己整个的青年时代和中年时代，在那些日子里，我实际上没有一个明确的政治目标，当我在执行所谓“命令”从事反革命战争的时候，我还以为自己是在“为国为民”。几十年的恶梦，一直到一九四九年和平起义投向人民时才猛然苏醒。和平起义，由黑暗走向光明，由反革命走向革命，由反人民走向人民，这是我的新生的转折。共产党挽救了我，共产党教育了我，使我明白了许多道理，使我能以自己的精力投入壮丽的社会主义建设事业。生我者父母，再生我者共产党。我一生一世不能忘记共产党。因此，我也就无法理解资产阶级右派老爷们
  （他们原都是共产党伸手挽救出来的！）反共的卑鄙行径。我愤怒！我要质问资产阶级右派老爷们：你们为什么如此丧心病狂？你们为什么这样不分好歹、不识抬举？你们为什么这样忘恩负义，以怨报德，向党和社会主义事业发动猖狂进攻？人而无良，何至若此？你们难道就忘记了自己罪恶累累、血债斑斑的大半生历史么？你们在今天充当“反共英雄”、“反社会主义的好汉”，忘记了一九二七到一九四九年的历史，不感觉到危险万状吗？
    资产阶级右派老爷们喜欢在共产党的宗派主义问题上做文章，他们甚至提出了
  “党天下”的谬论。他们认为“三害”是无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的产物。他们的逻辑是：既然有共产党存在，就有宗派主义存在，因此，为了彻底反掉宗派主义，就要从根本上反掉共产党。这是他们对宗派主义问题之所以津津乐道的全部不可告人的秘密。依我看，事实上，共产党与宗派主义是绝对不相容的。有些共产党员其所以沾染了宗派主义的习气，只是由于他们受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀和影响，共产党主动地提出整风，就证明了共产党是宗派主义的死敌。有些共产党员沾染的宗派主义习气，严重不严重呢？并不严重。可不可以克服呢？完全可以。人民军队是保持共产党的绝对领导的战斗集体，如果说人民军队内部有宗派主义，那就最容易表现在对待起义官兵的安排处理上。我是一个起义将领，八年来，我一直在军队中工作，我并没有感觉宗派主义的压力。在短暂的时期，在某些具体问题上，虽然也出现过一些宗派主义的消极现象，但是，我本着负责的精神，诚恳的态度，从团结的愿望出发，积极地提出意见，这些消极现象也就没有了。我现在工作得很愉快，我深深感到党对起义人员的“争取、团结、改造、教育”的政策的正确性和执行这个政策中已经取得的伟大成绩。我离开部队前夕，我们部队党委召集有广泛代表性的起义人员座谈了好几天，在座谈会上，大家众口一词地肯定了党对起义人员政策的英明正确，他们要打电报给党中央和毛主席表达自己感激之情，他们也要我向全国人民代表大会表达他们对人民政府和全国人民的感激之情。这有力地说明，对待起义人员的政策的坚决贯彻，保证人民军队在一个很重要的方面克服了宗派主义；而其它政策的坚决贯彻，保证人民军队在其它方面克服可能有的宗派主义。人民军队能够如此做，有什么理由、凭什么根据说共产党不可能通过整风运动来克服在学校、工厂、政府中存在着的宗派主义？叫喊“党委退出学校”，“公方代表退出公私合营企业”，“党组退出政府机关和群众团体”等等论调，究竟意味着什么，“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，实在用不着多所说明了。
    各位代表：我把我们部队官兵反右派斗争的热情带到这个大会上来，我用我们部队官兵的同样的热情高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    社会主义万岁！
