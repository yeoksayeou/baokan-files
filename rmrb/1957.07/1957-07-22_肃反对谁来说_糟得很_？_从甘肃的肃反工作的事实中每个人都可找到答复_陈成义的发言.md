    I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Premier Ulanhu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on the anti-rightist work in Gansu Province.

    It Would Be Impossible Without Anti-Rightist Struggle

    Before liberation, the counter-revolutionary forces in Gansu were quite strong. As early as during the domestic revolutionary war, the Kuomintang reactionaries established a vast secret service organization in Gansu to carry out sabotage activities against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Lanzhou had always been an important secret service stronghold. At the same time, Gansu's liberation came relatively late, so many secret agents and counter-revolutionaries fled to Gansu; and in terms of the speed of the liberation war's progress, it was relatively fast, so apart from a few secret service chiefs who escaped, most of the counter-revolutionaries remained in hiding. In addition, Gansu is a new industrial base in our country, and American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique constantly send agents to carry out sabotage activities. In the eyes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Gansu is economically and culturally backward, its ethnic relations are complex, and its feudal forces are strong—all of which are favorable conditions for carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. Therefore, since liberation, counter-revolutionary activities in the Gansu area have been relatively rampant.

    Generally speaking, counter-revolutionaries operate both openly and covertly. However, in the early days of liberation, counter-revolutionaries believed that the people's regime was not yet stable and that activities were more convenient, so they more often adopted overt subversive activities. Secret agents and counter-revolutionaries colluded with heads of reactionary secret societies, reactionary landlords, and other reactionary elements to carry out armed riots, attack people's armed forces and the people's government, and kill cadres and the masses; they organized counter-revolutionary groups, such as the so-called "Black Head Benevolence Army," "Anti-Communist and Restore Chiang Benevolence Army," "Sino-American Joint Revolutionary Party," and "Northwest Military Committee of the China Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," etc.; counter-revolutionaries even openly claimed to be "emperors" and wanted to sit on the "dragon throne," as many as seven people did this. After these overt counter-revolutionary activities were defeated, they turned to more covert methods, using counter-revolutionaries hidden within our state organs, organizations, factories, mines, schools, cooperatives, and stores to carry out all kinds of sabotage activities. They committed arson and poisoning, spread rumors and incited unrest, sabotaged production and construction, damaged machinery, stole intelligence, distributed reactionary leaflets and slogans, sowed discord, and even committed murder for revenge. Obviously, if we did not resolutely crack down on the activities of counter-revolutionaries, the people's regime could not be consolidated, social order could not be stabilized, the safety of the people could not be guaranteed, and production and construction could not proceed smoothly. Therefore, it is entirely necessary and entirely in line with the interests of the state and the people to resolutely carry out the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. The rightists call our anti-rightist work "making trouble out of nothing," attempting to negate the necessity of the anti-rightist work, which is a complete distortion of the facts.

    The Mass Line Method is Very Good

    Over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the anti-rightist work in the Gansu area has achieved great success. In particular, the two large-scale mass anti-rightist movements in 1951 and 1955 achieved even greater results. Through the anti-rightist struggle, overt and covert counter-revolutionaries were relatively thoroughly eliminated, social order was stabilized, the people's democratic dictatorship was consolidated, unity among and within ethnic groups was strengthened, productive forces were liberated, and the smooth progress of the revolutionary and construction undertakings was guaranteed. At the same time, the broad masses of the people were educated and tempered in the anti-rightist struggle, raised their political awareness and revolutionary vigilance, and gained experience in fighting against counter-revolutionaries. Now it is very clear that without the victory of the 1951 anti-rightist movement, various democratic reforms and economic recovery work would have been difficult to carry out smoothly; similarly, without the victory of the 1955 anti-rightist movement, the socialist revolution and socialist construction undertakings would have been difficult to carry out smoothly. The practice of anti-rightist work over the past eight years proves that adhering to the Party's leadership, adhering to the mass line, adhering to the principle of "eliminating all who are counter-revolutionary and correcting all mistakes," and adhering to the policy of combining suppression and leniency are the basic factors for achieving success in anti-rightist work, and also the basic experiences of anti-rightist work.

    Our anti-rightist work, adopting the method of mass movement, is entirely necessary and correct. Because the anti-rightist struggle is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle, and counter-revolutionaries are cunning and stubborn, it is necessary to launch a massive mass offensive to powerfully strike at the activities of counter-revolutionaries. In particular, the masses' accusations and denunciations are a heavy blow to counter-revolutionaries. In the anti-rightist movement in Gansu, from August 1955 to July 1956 alone, the masses reported more than 49,000 pieces of materials exposing counter-revolutionaries within organs and enterprises. After repeated verification, most of these materials were found to be consistent with the facts. In this situation, surrounded on all sides, and with our political offensive launched, calling on all counter-revolutionaries to surrender and confess their crimes, the counter-revolutionaries began to waver and split. In 1956 alone, 3,432 counter-revolutionaries surrendered voluntarily. At the same time, the led mass anti-rightist struggle can also ensure that the work progresses in a relatively healthy manner, can reduce the occurrence of errors, and can more easily correct even if they do occur. Anti-rightist work, like all other work, must combine leadership with the masses in order to achieve success. The reason why the rightists oppose our taking the mass movement approach to carry out anti-rightist work is precisely because we have more thoroughly eliminated counter-revolutionaries through the mass anti-rightist movement, which is indeed a difficult pain in the hearts of the rightists.

    Repeatedly Correcting "Leftist" Errors Still Requires Efforts to Correct Rightist Errors

    The achievements of the anti-rightist movement must be affirmed. The revolutionary enthusiasm and vigilance of the broad masses of people and cadres must be protected. This is the basic and main aspect. As for the specific work in the course of the movement, there have also been some deviations and errors. On the one hand, a small number of cases were handled incorrectly, some who could have not been arrested were arrested, and some were sentenced too severely. In some places, there were also "leftist" phenomena in the implementation of policies. In the past few years, we have conducted several inspections and corrections of these deviations and errors. For example, in 1956, we conducted a comprehensive review of cases from January 1955 to September 1956, and dealt with cases with such deviations and errors separately. On the other hand, some counter-revolutionaries were missed, some who should have been arrested were not arrested, some were sentenced too lightly, and some who should not have been released were released. In the implementation of policies, there were also rightist phenomena. We have paid less attention to deviations and errors in this regard in the past, and therefore have not been properly corrected. This needs to be improved in the future. In general, our Party and government have always taken a serious attitude towards deviations and errors in the anti-rightist struggle, and have followed the principle of "correcting all mistakes" by discovering and correcting them at any time. Here, it should be explained that it is unrealistic to demand that no deviations and errors occur at all in the anti-rightist movement. Especially in the face-to-face struggle, counter-revolutionaries cunningly deny their crimes, the masses are indignant, and some excessive actions are inevitable in some places, which is completely understandable. The rightists, however, are different. They seized on individual deviations and errors in the anti-rightist work, made a big fuss, acted like a sympathetic person, shouting that the anti-rightist movement was "mistaken" and that "the errors are the main ones." Some even advocated organizing "rehabilitation committees" that were not led by the Communist Party. The rightists' clamor is actually for their ulterior motives. To put it bluntly, they want to negate the correct leadership of the Party and the government in the anti-rightist movement, strike at the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people and anti-rightist work cadres, erase the great achievements of the anti-rightist movement, and support the counter-revolutionaries. Of course, in the eyes of the rightists, the achievements of the anti-rightist struggle are indeed a great "failure" and are indeed "terrible." However, in the eyes of the people, this is a great victory and is very good. The will and strength of the broad masses of people to resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries cannot be shaken by the rightists.

    There Are Still Counter-Revolutionaries; Being Careless Will Lead to Trouble

    Finally, I would like to particularly point out that the rightists' fallacy of "class struggle is outdated" is not only a serious distortion of Marxism-Leninism, but also harbors a sinister political intention. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The large-scale, rapid, and violent mass class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, but class struggle has not completely ended." This is exactly the case. As far as the anti-rightist work is concerned, although the counter-revolutionaries have been relatively thoroughly eliminated, there are still some. As proof, just on May 21 this year, Zhengning County in Gansu Province cracked down on the so-called "Creation of the National Righteous Army Defense Department" counter-revolutionary organization. The rightists' statement is actually intended to paralyze our revolutionary vigilance and disarm us ideologically. It is worth noting that recently, many comrades in the Gansu area have indeed developed a new kind of paralysis and rightist thinking, and have not maintained due vigilance against counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries, which is very dangerous. We must remember Chairman Mao's words: "If we lose our vigilance, we will be fooled and suffer a great loss." We must further improve our political acumen and revolutionary vigilance, and correctly distinguish between the enemy-us contradictions and the contradictions among the people. Wherever counter-revolutionaries appear to cause trouble, we will resolutely eliminate them.

    肃反对谁来说“糟得很”？
    从甘肃的肃反工作的事实中每个人都可找到答复
    陈成义的发言
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、乌兰夫副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。现在，我想就甘肃省的肃反工作讲一点意见。
    不肃反不得了
    在解放以前，甘肃的反革命势力是相当雄厚的。早在国内战争期间，国民党反动派为了对陕甘宁边区进行破坏活动，就在甘肃建立了庞大的特务机构。兰州一直是一个重要的特务据点。同时，甘肃的解放，在时间上来说，是比较迟，许多地方的特务反革命分子都逃到甘肃；而从解放战争的进展速度来说，又是比较快，除了少数的特务头子逃跑以外，大部分反革命分子都就地潜伏下来。加之，甘肃又是我国的一个新的工业基地，美帝国主义和蒋介石集团不断派遣特务前来进行破坏活动。在美帝国主义和蒋介石集团看来，甘肃经济文化落后，民族关系复杂，封建势力浓厚，所有这些，都是进行反革命活动的有利条件。因此，解放以来，甘肃地区的反革命活动曾经是比较嚣张的。
    反革命分子的活动方式，总的说来，是既有公开的，又有隐蔽的。不过，在解放初期，反革命分子以为人民政权还不稳固，活动比较方便，较多地采取公开的颠覆活动。特务反革命分子勾结反动会道门头子、反动的地主阶级分子和其他反动分子，进行武装暴乱，袭击人民武装部队和人民政府，杀害干部和群众；组织反革命集团，如所谓“黑头仁义军”、“抗共复蒋仁义军”、“中美联合革命党”、“中国反共救国军西北区军事委员会”等；反革命分子甚至公然自称“皇帝”，要坐“龙廷”，前后有七人之多。在这些公开的反革命活动遭到失败以后，就转而更多地采取隐蔽的方式。利用暗藏在我们国家机关、团体、厂矿、学校、合作社、商店内部的反革命分子，进行各种各样的破坏活动。他们放火放毒，造谣煽惑，破坏生产建设，破坏机器，偷窃情报，散发反动传单标语，挑拨离间，甚至凶杀报复。显然，对于反革命分子的活动，如果不给予坚决的打击，人民政权就不能巩固，社会秩序就不能安定，人民的安全就得不到保障，生产和建设就不能顺利进行。因此，坚决进行肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，是完全必要的，也是完全符合国家和人民的利益的。右派分子把我们的肃反工作说成“天下本无事，庸人自扰之”，企图否定肃反工作的必要性，这是彻头彻尾的歪曲事实。
    群众路线的方法好得很
    八年来，在党和政府领导下，甘肃地区的肃反工作获得了伟大的成绩。特别是一九五一年和一九五五年的两次大张旗鼓的群众性的肃反运动，成绩更大。经过肃反斗争，比较彻底地肃清了公开和暗藏的反革命分子，安定了社会秩序，巩固了人民民主专政，加强了民族之间和民族内部的团结，解放了生产力，保障了革命事业和建设事业的顺利进行。同时，广大人民在肃反斗争中受到了教育和锻炼，提高了政治觉悟和革命警惕性，取得了向反革命分子作斗争的经验。现在可以看得很清楚，如果没有一九五一年肃反运动的胜利，各项民主改革和经济恢复工作就难以顺利进行；同样的，如果没有一九五五年肃反运动的胜利，社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业就难以顺利进行。八年来肃反工作的实践证明，坚持党的领导，坚持群众路线，坚持“有反必肃、有错必纠”的原则，坚持镇压与宽大相结合的政策，是肃反工作取得成绩的基本因素，也是肃反工作的基本经验。
    我们的肃反工作，采取群众运动的办法，是完全必要的和正确的。因为肃反斗争是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，反革命分子是狡猾的、顽强的，必须发动一个千军万马声势浩大的群众性的攻势，才能有力地打击反革命分子的活动。特别是群众的检举、揭发，对于反革命分子更是沉重的打击。在甘肃的肃反运动中，从一九五五年八月到一九五六年七月，单是群众检举机关、企业内部反革命分子的材料，就有四万九千多件。这些材料，经过反复查对，绝大部分是符合事实的。这样，在四面楚歌的情况下，再加我们展开了政治攻势，号召一切反革命分子投案自首，反革命分子内部就开始发生动摇、分化，单是一九五六年一年内反革命分子自动投案的就有三千四百三十二人。同时，有领导的群众肃反，还可以保证工作进展得比较健康，可以少发生一些错误，即使发生了也比较容易纠正。肃反工作，同其他一切工作一样，必须使领导与群众相结合，才能获得成绩。右派分子的所以反对我们采取群众运动的方式去进行肃反，正是因为我们通过群众性的肃反运动比较彻底地肃清了反革命分子，这在右派分子的内心里确实是有难言之痛的。
    反复纠正了“左”还需努力纠正右
    肃反运动的成绩，是必须加以肯定的。广大群众和干部的革命积极性和警惕性是必须加以保护的。这是基本的主要的方面。至于在运动过程中，在具体工作上也曾经发生过一些偏差和错误。一方面有少数案件是搞错了，有的可以不捕的逮捕了，有的量刑偏重了。某些地方在执行政策中，也有“左”的现象。对于这方面的偏差和错误，在过去几年中，我们曾经进行了几次的检查和纠正。例如在一九五六年，我们就对从一九五五年一月到一九五六年九月的案件作过一次全面的检查，对于有这类偏差和错误的案件，都分别进行处理。另一方面，也有些反革命分子漏掉了，有的应该逮捕的没有逮捕，有的量刑偏轻了，有的不该释放的释放了。在执行政策中，也有右的现象。这方面的偏差和错误，过去我们注意得比较少，因而还没有得到应有的纠正。这是需要今后加以改进的。总的来说，我们党和政府对于肃反中的偏差和错误，态度从来是严肃的，本着“有错必纠”的原则，随时发现随时纠正，这里，应当说明，在肃反运动中，要求完全不发生偏差和错误，那是不切实际的。特别是在面对面的斗争中，反革命分子狡猾抵赖，群众激于义愤，某些地方难免发生一些过火的行动，这也是完全可以理解的。而右派分子则不然。他们抓住了肃反工作中个别的偏差和错误，借题发挥，大做其“翻案文章”，装出一副悲天悯人的样子，喊叫肃反运动“搞错了”，“错误是主要的”，有人甚至主张组织不要共产党领导的“平反委员会”。右派分子这样叫嚣，实际上是有他们不可告人的目的的。揭穿了说，无非是想否定党和政府对肃反运动的正确领导，打击广大人民和肃反工作干部的积极性，抹煞肃反运动的伟大成绩，替反革命分子撑腰而已。当然，肃反斗争的成绩，在右派分子看来，确是极大的“失败”的，确是“糟得很”。但是，在人民的心目中，这是伟大的胜利，是好得很。广大人民坚决肃清一切反革命分子的意志和力量，决不是右派分子所能动摇的。
    还有反革命，麻痹会上当
    最后，我特别指出，右派分子的所谓“阶级斗争过时了”的谬论，不但是对马克思列宁主义的一种严重的歪曲，而且还包藏着一种险恶的政治意图。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本结束，但是阶级斗争还没有完全结束。”事实正是这样。就肃反工作来说，反革命分子虽然已经被比较彻底地肃清了，但是还有。就在今年五月二十一日，甘肃正宁县就破获了所谓“创造国家人义军国防部”的反革命组织，就是证明。右派分子这种说法，实际上是想麻痹我们的革命警惕性，解除我们思想上的武装。而值得注意的是，最近以来，在甘肃地区确有不少同志滋长了一种新的麻痹右倾思想，对反革命分子和反动分子没有保持应有的警惕，这是很危险的。我们必须记住毛主席的话：“如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。”我们必须进一步提高政治嗅觉和革命警惕，正确地分清敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界限。不管什么地方出现反革命分子捣乱，我们就把他坚决消灭。
