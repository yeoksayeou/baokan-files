    Today is Egypt's "People's Day." Five years ago today, the Egyptian people deposed and banished Farouk, the last king of Egypt, enabling Egypt to achieve genuine independence from long-term imperialist and foreign rule. Four years later, in 1956, on the same day, the Egyptian people reclaimed the Suez Canal Company, uprooting the last vestige of imperialist colonial rule in Egypt. The independence that the Egyptian people had won through arduous struggle was thus further consolidated. In the past year, the Egyptian people demonstrated their strong will and heroic spirit, defeated the imperialist armed aggression, and achieved a great victory in the struggle to defend their independence and safeguard their sovereignty. We can imagine with what joy the Egyptian people will celebrate today this festival that marks the phoenix-like rebirth of Egypt. We, the 600 million Chinese people, also express our heartfelt congratulations to the Egyptian people with joy.
    The victory of the Egyptian people in their struggle for independence has opened a new page in Egyptian history. From then on, the Egyptian people have the opportunity to develop their economy, build their motherland, and eliminate the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule. In fact, in the past five years, Egypt has already achieved great success in economic construction. The nationalization of the Suez Canal Company has enabled Egypt to use the company's income to create more benefits for the Egyptian people. And Egypt's economic independence will further consolidate its political independence. A prosperous and strong new Egypt will stand tall on the African continent.
    Moreover, the significance of the Egyptian people's victory in striving for and safeguarding independence far exceeds the borders of Egypt. This victory has inspired the people of the Middle East and Africa in their struggle against colonialism and for independence, accelerating the collapse of the colonial system.
    The colonialists, of course, understand this. Therefore, how deeply do they loathe Egypt's independence! After Egypt's independence, the colonialists racked their brains to drag Egypt into the military aggression groups they had planned. They attempted to use this method to make Egypt's independence vanish and turn Egypt back into a colony. However, the awakened Egyptian people did not fall into the trap set by the colonialists, and the colonialists' conspiracy failed. After Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, colonial countries such as the United States, Britain, and France became even more furious. They carried out various blackmail and threats against Egypt, attempting to force Egypt to change this legitimate measure to safeguard its sovereignty and continue to crudely infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty. Finally, the old colonialists of Britain and France colluded with Israel and even launched a war of aggression against Egypt, attempting to take this opportunity to overthrow the Egyptian government led by President Nasser and strengthen their colonial rule in the Middle East and Africa. The new colonialists in the United States played an extremely insidious two-faced trick, once pretending to be "peace envoys," but in reality, they were just trying to seize and replace Britain and France's colonial position in the Middle East. But the colonialists miscalculated. In the end, it was not Egypt that failed, but the colonialists themselves; it was not Nasser who fell, but Eden and Mollet. The outcome of the Suez War, it should be said, gave all colonialists a good lesson: the era in which they could act arbitrarily on the heads of colonial people with their so-called "position of strength" is over.
    For the Egyptian people and all people in the world who are striving for independence, the history of Egypt in the past five years, especially the struggle surrounding the Suez Canal issue last year, is also an important lesson. Facts have proven that Egypt's independent and peaceful neutral policy in the past five years was completely correct. Precisely because of this, Egypt was able to unite all patriotic forces at home and gain the support of all peace-loving people internationally, thus victoriously withstanding the severe test of opposing imperialist aggression. Egypt's experience is very beneficial to all countries that are struggling to safeguard and strive for their independence. The victorious struggle of the Egyptian people also shows that in our era, the anti-imperialist struggle of weak nations is by no means isolated, and it will certainly receive the sympathy and support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world.
    The imperialists are not reconciled to the victory of the Egyptian people. While the Egyptian people are laughing, the imperialists are gnashing their teeth. Especially the United States, after squeezing out Britain and France's position in the Middle East, is carrying out frantic colonial expansion. It is trying every possible means to isolate Egypt and Syria, and it is determined to overthrow these two countries that adhere to independence.
    However, after five years of arduous and complex struggles, the eyes of the Egyptian people have become increasingly bright. Although there are still difficulties and serious struggles ahead, the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard independence and oppose colonialism will surely win victory after victory. And the Egyptian people can believe that in this just struggle, we Chinese people will, together with peace-loving people all over the world, be ready at any time to extend our hand of support to them.

### 埃及人民的喜庆节日

    埃及人民的喜庆节日
    今天是埃及的“人民节”。五年前的今天，埃及人民废黜和放逐了埃及最后一个国王法鲁克，使埃及从长期的帝国主义和异族统治之下取得了真正的独立。过了四年之后，1956年，又是在这一天，埃及人民收回了苏伊士运河公司，拔除了帝国主义在埃及的殖民统治的最后一条根子。埃及人民经过千辛万苦的斗争所争取得来的独立，因此得到了进一步的巩固。而在过去一年之中，埃及人民表现了坚强的意志和英雄的气概，击败了帝国主义的武装侵略，在保卫独立和维护主权的斗争中取得了巨大的胜利。我们可以想像，今天埃及人民将以怎样欢乐的心情，庆祝这个标志着埃及像凤凰一样新生的节日。我们六亿中国人民也怀着喜悦的心情，向埃及人民表示我们衷心的祝贺。
    埃及人民争取独立的胜利，揭开了埃及历史上新的一页。埃及人民从此有可能发展自己的经济，建设自己的祖国，消除长期殖民统治所造成的贫困和落后。事实上，在过去五年之中，埃及在经济建设方面已经得到了巨大的成就。苏伊士运河公司的收归国有，更使得埃及可以利用公司的收入，来为埃及人民谋更多的福利。而埃及经济上的独立，将进一步巩固它的政治上的独立。一个富强的新埃及，将在非洲大陆上巍然屹立。
    不仅如此，埃及人民争取和维护独立的胜利，其意义远远超出了埃及的国界。这个胜利鼓舞了中东和非洲人民的反对殖民主义、争取独立的斗争，加速了殖民主义制度的崩溃。
    殖民主义者们当然明白这个道理。因此，它们对埃及的独立是多么深恶痛绝呵！在埃及独立以后，殖民主义者就费尽心计，要把埃及拉进它们所策划的军事侵略集团。它们企图用这个手法，使埃及的独立化为乌有，使埃及重新成为殖民地。可是，觉醒了的埃及人民并没有陷入殖民主义者设下的这一圈套，殖民主义者的阴谋失败了。在埃及宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化以后，美英法等殖民国家更是暴跳如雷。它们对埃及进行了多方的讹诈和威胁，企图压迫埃及改变这一维护主权的正当措施，继续粗暴地侵犯埃及的主权。最后英法旧殖民主义者和以色列勾结一起，甚至向埃及发动了侵略战争，企图乘此机会推翻纳赛尔总统所领导的埃及政府，来加强自己在中东和非洲的殖民统治。美国新殖民主义者却玩弄了极其阴险的两面三刀的手法，一度曾伪装成“和平使者”，实际上只是为了夺取和代替英法在中东的殖民地位。但是殖民主义者失算了。最后失败的并不是埃及，而是殖民主义者自己；垮台的也不是纳赛尔，而是艾登和摩勒。苏伊士战争的结局，应该说，给所有的殖民主义者上了很好的一课：他们凭着所谓“实力地位”在殖民地人民头上胡作非为的时代，已经过去了。
    对于埃及人民和世界上所有争取独立的人民来说，埃及过去五年的历史，特别是去年围绕着苏伊士运河问题的斗争，也是重要的一课。事实已经证明，埃及在过去五年中奉行独立的、和平中立的政策是完全做对了。正因为这样，埃及才能在国内团结了一切爱国的力量，在国际上得到了一切爱好和平的人民的支持，从而胜利地经受了反对帝国主义侵略的严重考验。埃及的这个经验，对于所有正在为维护和争取自己的独立而斗争的许多国家来说，都是非常有益的。埃及人民的胜利斗争，也说明在我们这个时代，弱小民族的反帝国主义的斗争决不是孤立的，而是一定会得到全世界爱好和平与主张正义的人民的同情和支持的。
    帝国主义对于埃及人民的胜利是不甘心的。当埃及人民在欢笑的时候，帝国主义者们却在咬牙切齿。特别是美国，它在排挤了英法在中东的地位以后，正在进行疯狂的殖民扩张。它正在千方百计地企图孤立埃及和叙利亚，必欲推翻这两个坚持独立的国家而后快。
    但是，经过五年艰苦复杂的斗争，埃及人民的眼睛已经越来越亮。尽管前途还有困难，还有严重的斗争，埃及人民维护独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，必将节节胜利。而埃及人民可以相信，在他们这个正义的斗争中，我们中国人民将同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，随时随地准备向他们伸出我们的支援的手。
