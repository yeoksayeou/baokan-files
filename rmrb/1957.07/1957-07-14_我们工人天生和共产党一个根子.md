    We completely agree with Premier Zhou's report and other reports at the conference. Regarding the assessment of the achievements and shortcomings of various tasks in the report and the serious criticism of the right-wing elements, we worker representatives from Liaoning express our complete agreement.

    We feel that only those who have personally participated in the construction of the motherland in the past seven or eight years truly understand how great and valuable our achievements today are. We workers have shed blood and sweat together with the Party, and we know that these achievements have not come easily. Some people with ulterior motives want to use deceptive words to slander these achievements, which we workers absolutely cannot tolerate.

    Taking the factories where we workers work as examples, in 1950, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant could not even manufacture the simplest machine tools. It took two months to assemble two gear grinding machines, and they still couldn't be started. People called them "fragile Lin Daiyu-style machine tools." Now, it only takes about 60 minutes to manufacture a 1A62-type machine tool, and the quality has reached the international level. In 1952, the Dalian Shipyard needed 60 days to build a small electric boat with a load capacity of 500 tons, but now it only takes six days. During the Kuomintang's rule, the four coal mines in Fushun produced only more than 2,000 tons of coal per day, but now they have reached 27,000 to 28,000 tons. The Japanese devils once judged Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel) and said: "Ansteel's blast furnace cannot produce iron, it can only grow tall grains." Now, thanks to the leadership of our Party and the help of Soviet experts, steel production has more than doubled compared to the Japanese occupation. Other new and expanded projects such as Ansteel's large-scale, thin plates, seamless steel pipes, and blast furnaces are well known to everyone. Did these things come easily? No, they didn't. This result was obtained by overcoming countless difficulties and going through untold hardships. When we succeed in labor, the Party encourages us to move forward better; when we fail, the Party guides us in the right direction; when we have difficulties, the Party organizes workers across the country to support us. The one who understands us best and can correctly assess our labor is our working class's political party—the Communist Party. The right-wing elements are squinting and gesticulating, as if they are something special. In our opinion, you don't have much of a say. How much did you help us in overcoming difficulties?

    We workers are born with the same roots as the Communist Party, and only with the leadership of the Party can we workers have our status.

    In the old society, we lived on a diet of bean cakes, bran, and vegetable leaves. As the miners said, "When you arrive at Qianjinzai, you have to sell your bedding, the new ones are exchanged for the old ones, and the old ones are exchanged for sacks." Now, these miserable situations are gone forever. We can participate in the discussion and decision-making of national affairs, we workers can also manage factories, and we workers can also enter middle schools and universities. How did we get these? It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who led us to get them. We workers are very clear about this. Workers understand that wanting to get rid of the Communist Party's leadership is wanting to throw us back into the slave status of the old era. Anyone who dares to do that is the mortal enemy of our working class. We would like to invite the right-wing elements to visit our factories to see if their speeches have had any effect in our factories, and that is to arouse the anger of all the workers. When we were about to come to the meeting, many workers came to us and asked us to ask the right-wing elements what kind of hearts they have, especially the old workers in the nursing homes, who angrily raised their crutches. We think that it might be a little helpful for the right-wing gentlemen to visit our factories. Some hot-tempered workers may get angry, but we can be responsible for guaranteeing their personal safety. Please come and see, and talk. This may add some working-class perspective when they consider issues and make speeches in the future.

    The workers in Liaoning, like the workers across the country, are not only vigilant about the words and deeds of the right-wing elements, but are also actively carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in response to the Party's call, using practical actions to support the Party's leadership and accelerate socialist construction. We would like to give one or two examples to illustrate: The workers at Dalian Seaport proposed the slogan "One Hammer, One Jin of Grain," which means that every time a car is unloaded, a wooden hammer is used to tap the car skin once to save one jin of grain. In this way, the workers of the entire port can save 15 tons of grain for the country every year. The old shipbuilding worker, Comrade Cheng Yuanqin, has been working with mud and sand for nearly 50 years. Two years ago, the factory issued him a pension and asked him to retire. But he resolutely refused, always wanting to create wealth for the country. Therefore, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, he spent two months studying the method of using natural sand or Dahan sand, which can be bought for only five yuan a ton, to replace silica sand, which costs 30 yuan a ton. Using this sand to make rivet sand molds reduces the drying process, ensures quality, and saves one labor and several tons of coal per day. Such deeds are not isolated. Of course, there are also some difficulties and shortcomings in our work. For example, in our working class ranks, there are individual workers who have lax labor discipline, ask the state for more, and contribute less to the country's construction, and the sense of responsibility as masters of the country has not yet been established. Therefore, we must make a hundred times more efforts to improve our political and technical level, overcome shortcomings, further develop our initiative and creativity, tap potential to find tricks, and create more wealth for the country.

    Finally, we would like to make two suggestions to the relevant departments:

    (1) The existing problems in the organizational structure of factories. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and by learning from the experience of the Soviet Union, we have learned some management knowledge. Generally speaking, the existing organizational structure of factories is divided according to the object of technology, which is also appropriate. However, due to our lack of experience during the construction period, the production organization is divided too professionally and too centrally, making the organization too bloated and there are too many non-production personnel. This has also led to phenomena such as too many meetings, too many documents, slow problem solving, mutual buck-passing, and irresponsibility, which affect production. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we suggest: ① In order to simplify the factory's organizational structure, complex layers, and complicated procedures, some departments and workshop units can be appropriately merged according to the nature of the work. ② The factory's power is too concentrated in the factory headquarters. The authority of production, technology, finance, and planning should be appropriately delegated to the workshops. The departments should mainly study and trial-produce new products and solve technical difficulties for the workshops.

    (2) Some units do not pay enough attention to safe production. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, some unnecessarily removed the essential safety devices, some even abolished the safety technology department, and some units did not check their own safety technology work after industrial injury accidents, but simply blamed the workers for "paralysis," "carelessness," and pushed the responsibility for industrial injury accidents onto the workers. Enterprise leaders and enterprise authorities in charge (Ministry of Industry, Administration Bureau) rarely ask about or only verbally shout the slogan of "pay attention to safety" without studying and taking specific measures. We suggest that the leading cadres of the relevant enterprise authorities in charge (Ministry of Industry, Administration Bureau) take charge of safety technology work, earnestly study and overcome the shortcomings in safety technology work, and thoroughly implement the policy of "safe production."

    我们工人天生和共产党一个根子
    刘立富、郑锡坤、王文山、马恒昌、李川江、赵国有、王崇伦、孟泰、张明山、王玉吉、钱仲举、施玉海、谷发明、张子富、唐立言、韦玉玺的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理的报告和大会上其它各项报告。关于报告中对各项工作的成绩与缺点的估计和对右派分子的严肃的批驳，我们辽宁来的几个工人代表表示完全赞同。
    我们感到这七八年来，只有亲身参加了祖国建设的人，才真正的懂得，我们今天取得的成就是如何的巨大和可贵，我们工人同党一起流血流汗，深知得来不易。一些别有用心的分子想要哄言诋毁这些成果，这是我们工人所绝对不能容许的。
    以我们几个工人工作的工厂为例，一九五○年沈阳第一机床厂就是最简单的机床都制造不好，曾试制两台齿轮机床，仅装配就花了两个月的功夫，结果还开不动车，人们称它为“林黛玉式机床”。现在制造—A六二型机床每台约六十分钟就行了，而且质量已达到国际水平。大连造船公司一九五二年制造载重量五百吨的小电船需要六十天功夫，现在只要六天就完成了。抚顺四个煤矿在国民党统治时期，日产煤只有两千多吨，现在已达到两万七八千吨了。鞍钢日本鬼子曾经给鉴定说：“鞍钢的高炉不能出铁，只能长高粮”。现在由于我们党的领导和苏联专家的帮助，钢的产量已超过日寇时的两倍。其他像鞍钢大型、薄板、无缝钢管、高炉等新建与扩建工程是大家都知道的。这些事情都是轻而易举得来的吗？不是的。这个结果是克服了无数困难、经历了千辛万苦才得到的。我们在劳动中成功了，党鼓舞我们更好的前进；我们失败了，党指引给我们方向；我们有困难了，党组织全国工人弟兄支援我们。最了解我们的，最能正确估价我们的劳动的就是我们工人阶级的政党——共产党。右派分子斜眉斜眼、指手划脚的，像是不得了似的。依我们看来，你们的发言权不大，你们在我们克服困难中帮了多少忙呢？
    我们工人天生和共产党一个根子，只有有了党的领导，才有我们工人阶级的地位。
    在旧社会我们过的是用豆饼、糠皮、菜叶糊口的日子。正如矿工所说的那样，是“到了千斤寨，就把铺盖卖，新的换旧的，旧的换麻袋”。现在，这些凄惨的处境已经不复返了。我们能够参予国家事务的讨论和决定了，我们工人也能够管理工厂了，我们工人也能入中学、上大学了。这些是怎么得来的呢？是共产党是毛主席领导我们得来的，这一点我们工人是清清楚楚的，工人们都明白，想不要共产党的领导，就是想把我们重新抛到旧时代的奴隶地位里去。那一个胆敢这么办，他就是我们工人阶级的死敌。我们想请右派分子到我们工厂去看看：他们的言论在我们工厂里起了作用，那就是激起了全体工友的愤怒。我们临来开会的时候，许多工友找我们，叫我们找右派分子问问他们长的什么心胆，特别是养老院的老工友，气的抡起了拐棍。我们想，请右派先生们到我们工厂看看，对他们可能有点好处，有些火气暴的工友可能发火，但是我们可以负责保证他们的人身安全，请他们看看，谈谈。这样也许在他们今后考虑问题，发表言论的时候，会增加点工人的观念。
  　我们辽宁的工人和全国工人弟兄一样，一方面警惕着右派分子的一言一行，一方面正在响应党的号召积极开展增产节约运动，用实际行动来拥护党的领导，加速社会主义建设。我们想举一、二个例子来说明：大连海港工人提出“一锤一斤粮”的口号，就是每当卸完车后，用木锤往车皮上一敲打一华拉，节约一斤粮，这样一来，全港工人每年可为国家节约十五吨粮食。造船老工人程远钦同志摆弄泥砂快五十年了，头两年工厂就发给他养老金，叫他养老去。但他坚决不肯，总想给国家创造财富。于是在增产节约的运动中，用两个月的时间研究了只有五元钱就买到一吨的天然砂或大汉砂，代替了须三十元一吨的硅石砂的办法，用这种砂子制造铆链砂型，减少了干燥工序，保证了质量，并且每天省出一个人工和几吨煤。像这样的事迹并不是个别的。当然，在我们的工作中也有一些困难和缺点，例如在我们工人阶级队伍中，有个别的工人劳动纪律松懈，伸手向国家要的多，为祖国建设事业贡献的少，当家做主的责任感尚未树立起来。因此我们必须百倍努力提高政治、技术水平，克服缺点，进一步发挥积极性和创造性，挖掘潜力找窍门，为国家创造更多财富。
    最后，我们向有关部门提出两个意见：
    （一）目前工厂里组织机构存在的问题。几年来，我们在党领导下和学习苏联的经验，已经学会了一些管理知识。工厂的现有组织机构一般说来是根据工艺对象来划分的，也是适当的，但是由于我们在建设时期缺乏经验，把生产组织划分得过于专业和过于集中，使机构过于臃肿，非生产人员过多，这样也就产生了会议多、文件多、解决问题慢、互相扯皮互相推诿等不负责任的现象，影响了生产。为了克服这个缺点，我们建议：①为简化工厂组织机构、层次复杂、手续繁多，可根据工作性质适当合并一些科室和车间单位。②工厂权力过于集中厂部，应当把生产、技术、财务、计划的权限适当下放车间，科室应主要研究试制新产品和为车间解决技术困难等问题。
    （二）有些单位对安全生产重视得不够。在增产节约运动中，有的不适当地把必不可缺少的安全装置削掉了，有的还取消了安技科组织，有的单位在发生工伤事故后不检查自己的安技工作，只是单纯埋怨工人“麻痹大意”、“不小心”，把工伤事故责任推到工人身上。企业领导干部和企业主管部门（工业部、管理局）很少过问或者只空喊“注意安全”的口号，而不去研究采取具体措施。我们建议有关企业主管部门（工业部、管理局）的领导干部，把安技工作抓起来，认真地研究克服安技工作中的缺点，彻底地贯彻“安全生产”的方针。
