Why are Silkworms Dying in Large Numbers Every Year?
Shi Zilu, Jiaxing Special District

The Jiaxing Special District's silkworm cocoon production accounts for more than 80% of Zhejiang Province's total. However, in recent years, a large number of silkworms have died every year, and this year the mortality rate is particularly high. This is a very abnormal phenomenon.

Reasons for the Large Number of Silkworm Deaths

Last year, the Jiaxing Special District raised 668,000 sheets of silkworms, of which 19,000 sheets died, accounting for 2.8% of the total number of sheets raised. This year, 664,800 sheets of silkworms were raised, of which 55,000 sheets died, accounting for 8.2% of the total number of sheets raised. Why is the silkworm death rate even higher this year, even though 3,200 fewer sheets were raised compared to last year? According to my understanding, there are three reasons for the silkworm deaths:

The first is silkworm death due to a shortage of leaves. This year, silkworm death due to a shortage of leaves accounted for about 45% of the total number of silkworm deaths. For example, in Deqing County, the total number of silkworms raised this year increased by 17.7% compared to 1950, while the existing area of mulberry land only expanded by 9.4% compared to 1950. The increase in silkworm eggs is greater than the expansion of mulberry land, which is one of the reasons for the shortage of leaves. In 1950, the average amount of silkworm larvae per sheet of eggs was about 1.8 qian, which increased to 2.165 qian last year and 2.265 qian this year. In 1950, the average cocoon production per sheet of eggs was more than 42 jin and 2 liang, which increased to more than 56 jin and 3 liang last year. Therefore, in the early days after liberation, each sheet of silkworm eggs only needed about 600 jin of leaves, but now it needs 800 jin. This means that mulberry leaf production must increase by 33.3% to adapt to the increase in silkworm breeding. Mulberry leaf production in Deqing County has increased from an average of 568 jin per mu in 1950 to 740 jin, an increase of 30.2%, but it is still 3.1% short compared to the current demand for leaves due to the increase in silkworm breeding. The situation in other counties is not exactly the same, but generally similar. Secondly, due to the impact of natural disasters and climate, coupled with insufficient fertilization, mulberry leaf production decreased by 15%-20% compared to last year. The masses and leaders at all levels have estimated this point, so 3,200 fewer sheets of silkworms were raised this year than last year. However, due to the increase in the amount of silkworm larvae, the actual number of silkworms raised this year has increased rather than decreased compared to last year, so there is a greater shortage of leaves, and more silkworms have died.

The second is silkworm death for the purpose of selling leaves. This year, the price of leaves is expensive, ranging from eight to twenty yuan per dan. The masses believe that it is more profitable to sell leaves after the silkworms die, so they deliberately cause a large number of silkworms to die. Silkworm death due to selling leaves accounts for about 35% of the total number of silkworm deaths in the district. Of course, this is not the fundamental reason for the occurrence of silkworm deaths, because if this family does not kill their silkworms, then another family will. In the final analysis, the root cause lies in the shortage of leaves.

The third is silkworm death due to silkworm disease, which accounts for about 20% of the total number of silkworm deaths.

Neglectable Losses

Silkworm deaths cause serious economic losses to the country and the people. Silkworm deaths generally occur around the fifth instar. Calculating that each sheet of silkworm eggs consumes 400 jin of leaves, 55,000 sheets of silkworm eggs consume 22 million jin of leaves. Calculating that 14 jin of leaves can raise silkworms to produce 1 jin of cocoons, the production of cocoons is reduced by more than 1.5 million jin. With each jin of cocoons priced at 9 jiao, the farmers' income is reduced by more than 1.3 million yuan. The reduction in silkworm cocoon production affects the support for agricultural cooperatives to develop agricultural and sideline production and improve farmers' lives, and also affects the increase in silk production and national material exports. Although this loss cannot be accurately calculated now, the seriousness of the problem is very obvious.

How to Prevent Silkworm Deaths

The fundamental reason for silkworm deaths is the shortage of leaves. Simply reducing the number of silkworm eggs to prevent silkworm deaths is a passive approach. We should actively increase the production of mulberry leaves. Judging from the local specific situation, the main method of increasing mulberry leaf production is to increase the yield per unit area. The Jiaxing Special District has 1.1 million mu of mulberry land, of which 280,000 mu produce an average of 800 jin of leaves per mu, while the general land only produces 400 jin of leaves per mu. The highest yield is 2,500 jin, and some low-yield land only produces 100-200 jin, so the potential for increasing production is enormous.

Second, we must implement the principle of "determining the amount of silkworm eggs based on the amount of leaves." The silkworm egg management departments should inform leaders at all levels and the vast number of silkworm farmers of the average amount of silkworm larvae per sheet of eggs, so that they know how many eggs to order appropriately. At the same time, we must also do a good job in estimating mulberry leaf production, so that the estimate matches the actual situation in order to rationally determine the amount of silkworm eggs. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and do a good job in preventing and controlling silkworm diseases.

### 为啥年年大量倒蚕？

    为啥年年大量倒蚕？
    史子禄嘉兴专区蚕茧产量占浙江省80％以上。但近几年来年年发生大量倒蚕，今年倒蚕尤多，这是一种很不正常的现象。  
    大量倒蚕的原因
    去年嘉兴专区养蚕六十六万八千张，倒掉一万九千张，占饲养总数的2.8％；今年养蚕六十六万四千八百张，倒掉五万五千张，占饲养总数的8.2％。今年比去年少养三千二百张，为啥倒蚕更加多？据我了解，倒蚕有以下三种情况：
    第一种是缺叶倒蚕。今年因缺叶倒掉的蚕约占倒蚕总数的45％。如德清县：今年养蚕总数比1950年增加17.7％，现有桑地面积较1950年只扩大9.4％。蚕种增加多，桑地扩大少，这是产生缺叶的原因之一。1950年每张种平均蚁量约1.8钱，去年增加到2.165钱，今年为2.265钱；1950年每张种平均产茧四十二斤二两多，去年提高到五十六斤三两多。因此，解放初期每张蚕种只需叶六百斤左右，现在却需要八百斤。这就是说，桑叶必须增产33.3％才能与养蚕增产相适应。德清县桑叶产量，从1950年平均每亩产叶五百六十八斤提高到七百四十斤，增加30.2％，但与养蚕现在的增产需叶比较，还相差3.1％。其它各县情况，虽不尽同，大体近似。其次，受自然灾害和气候影响，加之施肥不足，桑叶比去年减产15％—20％。对这一点，群众和各级领导是有估计的，所以今年比去年少养三千二百张蚕。但蚁量增加，今年实际养蚕数比去年不是减少而是增多，所以缺叶多，倒蚕也就多。
    第二种是为了卖叶而倒蚕。今年叶价贵，从八元到二十元一担，群众认为倒蚕卖叶占便宜，于是有意大量倒蚕。因为卖叶而倒的蚕约占全区倒蚕总数的35％。当然，这不是发生倒蚕现象的根本原因，因为这家不倒那家就要倒，归根结蒂，症结在缺叶。
    第三种是因蚕病倒蚕，约占倒蚕总数的20％。
    不可忽视的损失
    倒蚕给国家和人民造成严重的经济损失。倒蚕一般发生在五龄前后，以每张种吃掉叶四百斤计算，五万五千张蚕种消耗叶达二千二百万斤；按十四斤叶养蚕产茧一斤计算，少产茧一百五十余万斤；每斤茧价以九角钱计，农民减少收入一百三十余万元。蚕茧减产，对支持农业社发展农副业生产和改善农民生活有影响，对增加丝绸生产和国家物资出口也有影响。尽管这笔损失账现在还算不清，但问题的严重性却是十分明显的。
      怎样防止倒蚕
    倒蚕的根本原因是缺叶。从单纯减少蚕种来防止倒蚕，这是消极的作法。我们应该积极增产桑叶。从当地具体情况看，增产桑叶的主要方法是提高单位产量。嘉兴专区有一百一十万亩桑地，其中二十八万亩平均每亩产叶八百斤；一般的只产叶四百斤；产量最高的是二千五百斤，有些产量低的只产一、二百斤，因此增产潜力极大。
    第二，必须贯彻执行“以叶定种”方针。管理蚕种机关，应将每张种的平均蚁量通告各级领导和广大蚕农，使他们心中有数，便于适量定种。同时，还要切实做好桑叶估产工作，使估产符合实际，才能合理定种。此外，要加强技术指导，做好防治蚕病工作。
