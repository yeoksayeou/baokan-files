I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1956 national final accounts and the 1957 national budget, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the 1957 national economic plan.

In Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report, it was mentioned that the Sanmenxia Water Control Project on the Yellow River officially started construction this year. This globally significant and unprecedented large-scale project in our country officially commenced on April 13th this year. The scale of this project is very large, and the work is also very arduous, and it is expected to take five or six years to complete. However, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, all employees at Sanmenxia have the confidence and determination to complete this task.

This project is the first project in our great plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water disasters and develop the Yellow River's water resources, and it is also a good start to this great plan. This is another factual demonstration to the world of the superiority of our socialist system. Only under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party is it possible to carry out this great socialist construction project.

As everyone knows, the nature of the Yellow River is different from that of the Yangtze River. It has less water flow, but its disasters are more serious. Why is this? The key problem lies in the fact that the Yellow River's water flow contains a large amount of sediment. When the Yellow River flows into the plains below Zhengzhou, the flow speed slows down, and the sediment settles, raising the riverbed over the years, making it an above-ground river. Currently, the bottom of the Yellow River is one to three zhang higher than the flat ground outside the dikes. The riverbed at Kaifeng is even higher than the city walls. Under these circumstances, the Yellow River has reached an extremely dangerous point and may change course at any time. In Chinese history, the Yellow River has changed course six times, and each time the farmlands, people, villages and homes along the water's path have suffered heavy losses. Faced with historical facts, we cannot close our eyes and pretend not to see them, and fail to take measures to eliminate hidden dangers in advance, thereby endangering the national economy. Building the Sanmenxia Reservoir is the correct way to solve the Yellow River problem. It can not only use the Yellow River's water to generate huge amounts of electricity and irrigate large areas of farmland, but also eliminate the hidden danger of the Yellow River changing course. Because with this reservoir, most of the sediment brought from the upper reaches can be blocked, and the sediment content of the water flowing downstream will be relatively small. The section of the riverbed from Zhengzhou to the sea will not continue to rise, but will gradually be scoured deeper and become an underground river.

There is no doubt that the Sanmenxia Reservoir can play a significant role in fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water disasters and developing the Yellow River's water resources. However, in order to maximize the role of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the following three auxiliary tasks must be given special attention:

First, we must do a good job in soil and water conservation in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Soil erosion in the loess areas of the upper reaches of the Yellow River is the only source of the Yellow River's sediment. Only by completing the soil and water conservation work in this area can we achieve fundamental results. Otherwise, even if the Sanmenxia Reservoir has a very large storage capacity, it will quickly be filled with sediment and lose its effectiveness. Therefore, in order to give full play to the role of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, we must attach importance to the soil and water conservation work in the upper reaches of various provinces and regions.

Second, we must do a good job in relocating people from the upper reaches. The Sanmenxia Reservoir needs to submerge a considerable amount of farmland to obtain storage capacity. Despite the policy of gradually raising the water level, a certain number of people must be relocated at the beginning. This relocation work must be done very well to reduce the difficulties people face when changing their living environment.

Third, we must do a good job in straightening the downstream riverbed. After the Sanmenxia Reservoir is completed, the water flowing out of the reservoir will not be completely clear, but the sediment content will be greatly reduced. Therefore, if the downstream riverbed is straightened well, the water flow will be concentrated, and the scouring will be deeper and deeper, gradually changing the above-ground river into an underground river. Conversely, if it is not straightened and allowed to flow randomly, it can also create gullies and breach the dikes. Therefore, while the Sanmenxia Reservoir is under construction, we must plan for the straightening of the downstream riverbed in a timely manner to avoid being caught off guard when the clear water flows down.

The above opinions are for the reference of all the representatives.

    有关三门峡水库的几件事
    汪胡桢的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五七年度国民经济计划的报告。
    在薄一波副总理的报告里已经提到黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程今年正式开工。这个全世界属目，我国破天荒的大工程是在今年四月十三日正式开工的。这个工程的规模很大，工作也很艰难，预计要历时五、六年才能完成。但在中国共产党的正确领导下，三门峡全体员工是有信心有决心来完成这个任务的。
    这个工程是我国根治黄河水患，开发黄河水利的伟大计划里的第一个工程，也是这个伟大计划的一个良好的开端。这是又一次向全世界用事实来证明我国社会主义制度的优越性，也只有在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，才有可能来进行这个伟大的社会主义建设工程。
    大家知道黄河的性质是和长江不相同的，它流出的水量少而灾害反而严重。这是什么缘故呢？问题的关键就在黄河水流中含着大量的泥沙，当黄河流到郑州以下的平原里时，因为流速减缓，泥沙就沉淀下来，年深月久，把河槽淤高，成为地上河。现时黄河河底已比堤外的平地高出一丈到三丈，开封的河底比城墙还要高。在这种情况下，黄河已经到了极危险的地步，随时有改道的可能。我国历史上黄河大改道已有六次之多，每次改道时水流经过处的农田，人民，村舍都有大量的牺牲。在历史事实面前，我们不能闭了眼睛装做不见，不预先做好消除隐患的措施，而使国民经济有受到破坏的危险。建设三门峡水库就是正确的解决黄河问题的办法，不但可以利用黄河的水来发生巨量的电力和灌溉大量的农田，也可以用来消灭黄河改道的隐患。因为有了这水库，可以拦蓄从上游带来大部分的泥沙，向下游流出去的水流的含沙量就比较小，郑州到海的一段河槽不会继续淤高，而有逐渐刷深成为地下河的可能性。
    没有疑问，三门峡水库在根治黄河水患开发黄河水利方面是能起极大的作用的，但要使三门峡水库发挥最大的作用，下面三桩辅助工作是不能不特别重视的。
    第一、要做好黄河上游水土保持工作。黄河上游黄土地区里的水土流失是黄河沙泥的唯一来源，只有完成这个地区的水土保持工作，才可得到正本清源的结果，否则尽管三门峡水库有极大的库容也要很快给泥沙淤满而失去其效用。所以为了要发挥三门峡水库的作用必须重视上游各省区的水土保持工作。
    第二、要做好上游移民工作。三门峡水库须淹没相当数量的耕地才能得到库容，尽管采取逐步升高水位的政策，在开始时也要迁移一定数量的人民。这种移民工作必须做得十分完善，才可减少人民变更生活环境时的困难。
    第三、要做好下游河槽整理工作。三门峡水库完成后，从水库流出的水流虽不是完全清澈，但含沙量已大大减少。因此下游的河槽倘使整理得好，则水流集中，越刷越深，能逐渐改变地上河为地下河。反之，倘使不加整理，任其乱流，则也能造成串沟，冲决堤防。因此在三门峡水库施工的同时必须打算好下游河槽的整理计划，及时进行，以免清水流下时措手不及。
    以上意见，请全体代表同志们指教。
