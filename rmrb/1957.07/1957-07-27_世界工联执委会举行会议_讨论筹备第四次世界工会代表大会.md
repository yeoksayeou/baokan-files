Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26th: The 14th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) opened on the 24th in the October Hall of the Moscow Trade Union Building.

In his opening speech, WFTU President Giuseppe Di Vittorio emphasized the significance of holding this meeting to discuss important issues related to the preparations for the Fourth World Trade Union Congress.

According to the decision of the last WFTU Executive Committee meeting, the Fourth World Trade Union Congress will be held in Leipzig in October this year.

Di Vittorio said that representatives of trade union organizations of various tendencies have been invited to participate in the Fourth Congress, which will once again demonstrate that the WFTU is an international organization fighting for trade union unity. He said that the issue of unity was, is, and remains a matter of paramount importance to the working people of the world. If this issue is resolved, it can guarantee that the working class and other working people obtain better living and working conditions, it can guarantee the victory of the cause of the working people in their struggle to free themselves from exploitation, and it can enable the working people to avoid the threat of a new world war.

Subsequently, the Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, Grishin, extended congratulations to the meeting.

Afterwards, the General Secretary of the WFTU, Louis Saillant, delivered a report on the plan and general principles for discussing the first item on the agenda of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress.

Saillant pointed out that since the Third World Trade Union Congress held in 1953, the working class around the world has accumulated new and very rich experience. He said that it is necessary to draw from this experience the necessary lessons that are suitable for all trade unions in the world. The Fourth World Trade Union Congress must not only take into account the work and initiatives of the WFTU, but also analyze the work development of all trade unions, including those that do not belong to the WFTU. The purpose of convening this Congress is to make it a congress of unity. Its main task is to seek new and more ways to strengthen the united action of the working class.

Saillant continued that all trade union organizations that unite workers of different nationalities and races, with different political and religious beliefs, should reach agreements and establish friendly relations with each other in order to safeguard peace. It is always better to do this now than under conditions of war.

Saillant said that the main lesson of the strikes that have swept across capitalist countries in recent years is that if the working people and trade unions achieve concerted action, then the chances of the working people winning in class conflicts are greatly increased. If trade unions are isolated and divided, then the struggle is more difficult, and confidence in the victory of the strike movement will be weakened. The line of the Third World Trade Union Congress remains valid, which is that the struggle for unity should achieve the following goals: a unified trade union in every enterprise, a unified national federation in every industrial sector or profession, a unified national trade union center in every country, and a unified world trade union organization in the world. The WFTU firmly stands on its principled position, believing that the realization of trade union unity at the local, national, or world level does not necessarily require prior ideological uniformity of the working class.

Saillant firmly refuted the arguments spread in some places that the simultaneous existence of the WFTU and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) is an obstacle to unity.

Saillant concluded by saying that the aim of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress is to restore international unity by establishing a unified world trade union organization, and it should call on all trade union organizations to begin consultations in order to determine a minimum program of struggle that is suitable for and proposed by trade union organizations in various countries.

After Saillant's report, the meeting began discussions.

    世界工联执委会举行会议
    讨论筹备第四次世界工会代表大会
    据新华社26日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：世界工会联合会执行委员会第十四次会议24日在莫斯科工会大厦十月大厅开幕。
    世界工联主席维多里奥在开幕词中强调指出了召开这次会议讨论筹备第四次世界工会代表大会的重要问题的意义。
    根据世界工联执委会上次会议决定，第四次世界工会代表大会将在今年10月间在来比锡举行。
    维多里奥说，被邀请参加第四次代表大会的有各种倾向的工会组织的代表，这将再次表明，世界工会联合会是一个为工会的团结而斗争的国际性组织。他说，团结的问题过去是，今后仍然是全世界劳动人民的具有头等重要意义的问题。这个问题如果解决了，就可以保证工人阶级和其他劳动阶层的人民获得较好的生活条件和劳动条件，就可以保证劳动人民争取摆脱剥削的事业获得胜利，就可以使劳动人民得以避免新世界战争的威胁。
    接着，全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申向会议致贺词。
    随后，世界工联总书记赛扬就有关讨论第四次世界工会代表大会第一项报告的计划和总方针的问题作了报告。
    赛扬指出，自1953年举行世界工会第三次代表大会以后，全世界的工人阶级积累了新的、而且非常丰富的经验。他说，必须从这些经验中吸取对世界所有工会都适合的必要的教训。世界工会第四次代表大会不仅必须考虑到世界工联的工作和倡议，而且还必须对所有工会，包括不属于世界工联的工会的工作发展作出分析。召开这次代表大会的目的是：使代表大会成为团结一致的大会。它的主要任务是：寻求新的、更多的办法来加强工人阶级的团结行动。
    赛扬接着说，把各种不同民族和种族的、抱有不同的政治和宗教信仰的工人团结起来的所有工会组织，应当达成协议，并且互相建立友好关系以维护和平。现在这样做总比在战争的条件下做要好。
    赛扬说，近年来资本主义世界各国中掀起的罢工的主要教训是：如果劳动人民和工会之间取得一致行动，那么劳动人民在阶级冲突中获得胜利的机会就大大增加，如果工会各自孤立和分裂，那么斗争更加困难，对罢工运动获得胜利的信心也就会减弱。世界工会第三次代表大会的路线仍然有效，这条路线是：争取团结的斗争应当达到这样的目的：在每一个企业里有一个统一的工会，每一个工业部门或每一种职业有一个统一的全国联合会，每一个国家有一个统一的全国工会中心，全世界有一个统一的世界工会组织。世界工会联合会坚决站在自己的原则立场上，认为在地方、全国或世界范围内实现工会的团结不一定就要事先实现工人阶级在思想上的一致。
    赛扬坚决驳斥了散布在某些地方的论调，这种论调硬说，世界工联和国际自由工联的同时并存是团结的障碍。
    赛扬最后说，第四次世界工会代表大会的目的是想通过建立统一的世界工会组织以恢复国际团结，它应该号召所有工会组织开始磋商，以便确定对各国工会组织都适合的并由它们提出的最低斗争纲领。
    赛扬报告结束以后，会议就开始了讨论。
