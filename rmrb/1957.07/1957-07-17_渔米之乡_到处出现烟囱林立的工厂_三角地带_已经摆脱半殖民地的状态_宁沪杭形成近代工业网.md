Our Shanghai dispatch on the 16th of this month: Increasing numbers of modern industries are adding endless splendor to the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan. Recently, reporters from this newspaper stationed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai conducted separate investigations into the industrial development of the Ningbo, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas. The results of the investigations show that the modern industry in the Jiangnan area has developed rapidly in recent years, and the famous "land of fish and rice" is simultaneously forming into a huge modern industrial base.

Jiangsu Province, which was only known at home and abroad for its light industry before liberation, now has a considerable number and scale of heavy industries. From the coast of the Yellow Sea to the Beijing-Shanghai line, many heavy industrial enterprises have been restored and built. Now, the output of Jiangsu's major heavy industrial products, such as electricity, raw coal, fertilizer, cement, and machine tools, has increased four to ten times compared with the highest annual output before liberation. The Yongli Ning Factory, across the river from Nanjing, will produce enough fertilizer this year to fertilize more than 100,000 mu of arable land in Jiangsu Province. The Jiangnan Cement Plant at the foot of Qixia Mountain failed to produce a ton of cement after 16 years of preparation before liberation. Now it has become one of the largest cement plants in China, with an annual output of 400,000 tons. The Jinping Phosphate Mine on the coast of the Yellow Sea, which has rich reserves, was nothing more than a pile of dilapidated houses and a pit of sewage before liberation, relying only on the manual labor of a few employees to maintain production. Since 1953, a large inclined shaft and a mechanized apatite processing workshop have been newly built here. This year's annual output can exceed eight times that of a year before liberation. In October last year, a new batch of construction projects including six new-style mine shafts, a beneficiation plant, and a power station with modern equipment was started. After the completion of this project, the Jinping Phosphate Mine will become China's first automated and electrified new-type phosphate mine.

The construction of modern industry has changed the old appearance of many cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line. The ancient Xuzhou, which suffered from the ravages of war, is being built into a new coal mining city. Pairs of new-type mine shafts and new mining areas are increasing year by year. In the early days of liberation, there were only two pairs of mine shafts, Xiaqiao and Hanqiao, with extremely low output. Since 1953, large-scale exploration has proved that nearly 10 billion tons of coal are stored underground in an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers around Xuzhou, which is enough to build a new coal industry base. Now new mine shafts are being started one after another, and old mine shafts have also been renovated and expanded. The degree of mechanization of coal mining has reached more than 90%. People call this place "the Donbass of East China." Nanjing, which was ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionary government for more than 30 years, is now the largest heavy industrial city in Jiangsu. The number of factories has increased from 20 before liberation to 113, of which 25 have more than 1,000 employees. The problem is not just the surge in quantity, but that the production level of these factories is far from comparable to that before liberation. For example, the current Nanjing Machine Tool Plant could only produce simple machines such as animal-drawn "cultivators" and straw rope machines at the time of liberation. Now the factory has more than 2,000 employees and 295 engineering and technical personnel. In the past few years, they have manufactured more than 4,000 various lathes for the country. Among the 19 types of lathes that have been trial-produced and produced, 7 are new electric lathes. Some have even participated in foreign exhibitions. Many new products designed or trial-produced by the factories themselves, such as high-pressure vessels, "Remicid," spark plugs, fluorescent lamps, portable cameras, and special cement, have never been produced in Chinese history. At present, another batch of newly built, renovated, and expanded projects, such as phosphate fertilizer plants, meat and egg processing plants, and Xiaguan Power Plant, are under construction in Nanjing's urban and suburban areas.

In order to supply the emerging industries in the Ningbo, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas and the people of Jiangnan with abundant power, a huge power grid is under construction. A large thermal power plant with a high degree of automation—the Wangting Power Plant—is under construction in Wangting on the Ningbo-Shanghai line. According to the latest news, the four main workshops of the power plant, such as the boiler and turbine, have been basically completed, and the first unit will start generating electricity at the end of this year.

On the banks of the beautiful Xin'an River in Zhejiang, a huge Xin'an River Hydropower Station has also been started. After completion, this hydropower station will be larger than China's Fengman Hydropower Station. Its power generation capacity is 580,000 kilowatts, and its annual power generation is 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours, which is more than ten times the power generation of all power plants in Zhejiang. The Shanghai power plant has also completed a large-scale expansion project in recent years. At the same time as the construction of the power station, the first 110,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line in the Jiangnan area—the Shanghai-Wangting line—has been completed and put into operation. In the future, this transmission line will be modified into a 220,000-volt trunk line to form a large Jiangnan power grid including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Anhui.

Shanghai, the economic center of Jiangnan, has seen even faster industrial development in recent years. This largest light textile industrial city in China has now become a heavy industrial city with a huge productive force with an independent manufacturing system. The following figures show its development speed: Shanghai's steel output was 8,000 tons in the highest year before liberation, and now the annual output has reached more than 680,000 tons, an increase of 84 times; before liberation, the annual output of motors was only 3,000 kilowatts in the highest year, and now it has reached more than 280,000 kilowatts, an increase of 93 times, other such as the annual output of generators more than 300 times, bicycle production more than 23 times, - the main change is not in the surge in output, but that Shanghai has broken away from the backward state of a semi-colonial country that cannot independently manufacture industrial products, and is moving towards independently manufacturing various advanced industrial products in complete sets. According to statistics, Shanghai has produced about 10,000 new industrial products after liberation that have never been produced in old China, including complete sets of power generation equipment, various precision machine tools, and so on. Shanghai's light, textile, and chemical industries have also made great progress. The daily-use industrial products shipped to the Jiangnan area and all over the country are increasing year by year.

While making full use of existing equipment, Shanghai has also carried out and is continuing to carry out large-scale industrial capital construction. Several large-scale heavy industrial factories have completed expansion projects. Three new industrial zones are currently under construction in the suburbs of Shanghai, where dozens of small and medium-sized electromechanical, chemical, and instrument factories will be newly built.

Zhejiang, the "land of fish and rice" with little modern industry in history, now has new factories on the banks of the beautiful Qiantang River. According to statistics, Zhejiang has newly built, renovated, and put into production more than 520 factories and mines after liberation. In the fishing areas of Zhoushan, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other coastal areas of Zhejiang, large-scale fish meal factories and shipyards have appeared. Fish drying plants and cold storage plants are also under construction. During the second five-year plan period, a complete set of aquatic industry will appear on the coast of the East China Sea. Among the 71 major industrial products in Zhejiang Province, such as silk, cotton textile, power generation, cement, machinery manufacturing, alum, waxed paper, flour, wine making, pharmaceutical, oil pressing, and tea making, 67 have exceeded the highest annual output in history. Among the 26 products included in the national plan, the output of 6 products such as diesel engines, internal combustion engines, civilian ships, and linen has completed the national five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. In the past few years, Zhejiang has trial-produced nearly 300 new products, such as complete sets of oxygen generators, refrigeration equipment, Soviet-style drilling machines, and "electrolytic capacitor paper" known as the king of paper. Some of these products have reached international standards.

The ancient silk industry in Zhejiang is undergoing a historic change—from manual production to machine production. The state is building a large-scale silk printing and dyeing joint factory in Hangzhou. After the completion of this factory, it will use a complete set of mechanized and automated equipment to silk reeling, silk weaving, printing and dyeing, and completely change the semi-handicraft production mode of the past silk printing and dyeing industry. Zhejiang's annual silk output now accounts for one-third of the country's total. The length of silk fabrics produced in the past eight years can circle the Earth's equator more than three times. In recent years, more than 50 new varieties and more than 500 new patterns have also been trial-produced, such as Yunxia satin, mandarin duck crepe, and health flannel. The Hangzhou-Ningbo railway, which had been damaged for more than 20 years and had not been repaired, was fully opened to traffic in 1956. It connects Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo in the Yangtze River Delta. The completion of this railway has played an important role in prospering the economic life of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

"Dark clouds cannot cover the sun for long, and the lies of the right-wingers cannot deceive people." This is the common voice of the people of Jiangnan in denouncing the right-wingers. The great achievements of Jiangnan's industrial construction after liberation cannot be denied by anyone.

    “渔米之乡”到处出现烟囱林立的工厂  “三角地带”已经摆脱半殖民地的状态
    宁沪杭形成近代工业网
    本报上海16日电　日益增多的近代工业，正在给美丽的江南景色增添无限异采。最近，本报驻江苏、浙江和上海的记者，分别就宁沪杭地区的工业发展状况进行了调查，调查结果说明近年来江南地区的近代工业发展很快，闻名的“渔米之乡”正在同时形成为一个庞大的近代工业的基地。
    解放前只以轻工业闻名国内外的富庶的江苏省，现在已经拥有了数量、规模都很可观的重工业。从黄海之滨，到京沪沿线，许多重工业企业被恢复和建设起来了。现在江苏主要的重工业产品，如电力、原煤、肥田粉、水泥、机床等产量，都比解放前最高年产量增长四倍到十倍。与南京一江之隔的永利宁厂，今年生产的肥田粉，足够供应全江苏省十万余亩耕地面积施肥之用。栖霞山麓的江南水泥厂，过去筹建十六年，未能生产出一吨水泥，现在它已成为国内最大的水泥厂之一，年产量已达到四十万吨。黄海边上有着丰富蕴藏量的锦屏磷矿，解放前不过是一堆破屋和一片污水坑，仅靠少数职工的手工劳动维持生产，自1953年起，这里新建了一个大型斜井和一座机械化的磷灰石加工车间，今年年产量可超过解放前一年的八倍多。去年十月，这里又动工新建一批包括有六个新式矿井和选矿厂、发电站等现代化设备的基建工程，这一工程完成后，锦屏磷矿就将成为我国第一座自动化电气化的新型磷矿。
    近代工业的兴建使京沪沿线的许多城市改变了旧日的面貌。受尽了战争创伤的古老的徐州，正在建成为一个新的煤矿之城。一对对新型矿井和一处处新矿区正在逐年增加。解放初期这里只有夏桥和韩桥两对矿井，产量极低，从1953年开始，经过大规模勘探证明，在徐州市周围广场一千余平方公里的地下，蕴藏着近百亿吨的煤，足可建设成一个新的煤业基地。现在新的矿井正陆续开工兴建，老的矿井也进行了改建扩建，采煤机械化程度已达90％以上。人们称这儿为“华东的顿巴斯”。被国民党反动政府蹂躏了三十多年的南京，现在已是江苏最大的重工业城市，工厂已由解放前的二十个发展到一百一十三个，其中一千人以上的就有二十五个。问题还不在于数量的激增，而在于这些工厂的生产水平都远非解放前所能比拟，如现在的南京机床厂，解放时只能配制一些马拉“耕种机”和草绳机等简单机械，现在这个厂已拥有二千多职工和二百九十五个工程技术人员，几年来他们已为国家制造出四千多台各式车床。在已经试制和生产的十九种车床中，有七种是新式的电动车床。有些并参加过出国展览。许多工厂自己设计或试制成功的新产品，如高压容器、“雷米封”、火星塞、萤光灯、手提摄影机和特种水泥等，都是我国历史上从来没有生产过的。目前，又一批新建、改建扩建的工程，如磷肥厂、肉类蛋品加工厂和下关电厂，正在南京市区和郊区加紧施工中。
    为了供应宁沪杭地区的新兴工业和江南人民以充裕的动力，一个庞大的电力网已在兴建中，宁沪线上的望亭正在兴建一座自动化程度很高的大型火力发电站——望亭发电站，据最近消息，电站的锅炉、汽机等四个主要车间，已经基本完成，第一台机将于今年年底开始发电。
    在浙江风景优美的新安江畔，一座规模巨大的新安江水力发电站也已经动工，这个水力发电站建成后比我国丰满水电站还要大，它的发电能力有五十八万瓩，全年发电量十六亿度，比目前浙江所有的电厂发电量大十倍以上。上海的发电厂近年来也完成了规模很大的扩建工程。与建设电站同时，江南地区第一条十一万伏超高压输电线——上海望亭线已经建成并开始输电。将来这条输电线将改装为二十二万伏的干线，形成为包括江、浙、沪、皖地区的江南大电力网。
    江南的经济中心上海，近年来工业发展得更快。这座我国最大的轻纺工业城市现在已同时成为一个拥有独力制造体系的生产力巨大的重工业城市。从以下几个数字中即可以看出它的发展速度：上海钢材产量解放前最高的一年是八千吨，现在年产量已达到六十八万多吨，增加八十四倍；解放前电动机的年产量最高只有三千瓩，现在已达到二十八万多瓩，增加九十三倍，其它如发电机年产量超过三百多倍，自行车产量超过二十三倍，——主要的变化还不在于产量的激增，而在于上海已摆脱了不能独立制造工业品的半殖民地的落后状况，走向独立地成套地制造各种高级工业品，据统计解放后上海已生产出约一万种旧中国历史上从未生产过的新工业品，其中包括成套发电设备、各种精密机床等等。上海的轻、纺、化学工业，也都有极大的发展。运往江南地区和全国各地的日用工业品，一年比一年多。
    在充分利用旧有设备的同时，上海也进行了并还在继续进行规模宏大的工业基本建设。好几个大型重工业工厂已完成扩建工程。上海郊外目前正在兴建三个新工业区，在这里将要新建几十个中小型的机电、化工、仪表工厂。
    历史上很少近代工业的“渔米之乡”浙江，现在在秀丽的钱塘江畔，也出现了一座座新的工厂。据统计浙江在解放后新建、改建并投入生产的厂矿企业，已有五百二十多所。浙江沿海舟山、宁波、温州等渔区，出现了规模较大的鱼粉厂、造船厂，现在还在兴建的有鱼类烘干厂、冷藏厂等。在第二个五年计划期间，东海之滨将出现全套水产工业。浙江省丝绸、棉纺织、发电、水泥、机械制造、明矾、蜡纸、面粉、酿酒、制药、榨油、制茶等七十一种主要工业产品中，已有六十七种超过历史上最高年产量。列入国家计划的二十六种产品中已有柴油、内燃机、民用船舶、麻布等六种产品产量提前一年完成了国家五年计划。几年来浙江试制成了全套的制氧机、冷冻设备、苏式台钻和被称为纸中王牌的“电溶器纸”等近三百种新产品。这些产品有一部分已达到国际水平。
    古老的浙江丝绸工业，正在经历着历史性的变化——从手工生产过渡到机器生产。国家正在杭州兴建一座规模巨大的丝绸印染联合工厂，这个工厂建成后，将采用全套的机械化和自动化设备来缫丝、织绸、印染，彻底改变过去丝绸印染工业半手工业生产方式。浙江丝绸的年产量现占全国三分之一。八年来生产的绸缎长度，可围绕地球赤道三转多。近年来，还试制了云霞缎、鸳鸯绉、健康呢等五十多种新品种和五百多种新花样。已被损毁了二十多年未曾修复的杭（州）甬（江）铁路，1956年已全线通车，它把长江三角洲的沪、杭、甬连接起来，这条铁路的建成，对繁荣江浙地区的经济生活起了重要的作用。
    “乌云不能长久遮住太阳，右派分子的谎话骗不了人”，这是江南人民声讨右派分子的共同声音。解放后江南工业建设的伟大成绩是任何人不能抹煞的。
