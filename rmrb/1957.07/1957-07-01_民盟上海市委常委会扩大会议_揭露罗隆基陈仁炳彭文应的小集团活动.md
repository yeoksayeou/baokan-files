Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 30th. The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League held on the afternoon of the 29th made a decision: to suspend Chen Renbing and Peng Wenying, deputy chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, from all positions within the League, and order them to reflect. It also suggested that the Central Committee of the China Democratic League suspend Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun from their positions and Chen Renbing and Peng Wenying from their positions as central committee members.

    Many league members revealed at the meeting the close relationship between Chen Renbing, Peng Wenying, and bourgeois rightist ringleader Luo Longji, as well as their petty clique activities. Xue Baokang said that when Shanghai was first liberated, before Luo Longji went to Beijing, he had a conversation with Chen Renbing, Peng Wenying, and Xue Baokang, etc., saying that they were all to be contacted by Luo Longji. After that, Peng Wenying and Chen Renbing conducted activities in a planned way, organizing a "brainstorming session" core organization, squeezing out progressive people, and conspiring to seize all leadership power of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Song Weihui said that in 1950, during Peng Wenying's attendance at a meeting in Beijing, he wrote a letter back to convey Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun's instructions to the Shanghai organization of the China Democratic League. He demanded that Peng Wenying and Chen Renbing thoroughly explain their relationship with Luo Longji and their petty clique activities. Wu Chengyu systematically revealed Peng Wenying's scandalous history, explaining that Peng Wenying was a politician, a philistine, and a bully, and Luo Longji's agent in Shanghai. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Peng Wenying colluded with the Kuomintang. In the autumn of 1937, when Chiang Kai-shek convened the Lushan Conference, he had called Peng Wenying to participate. After liberation, Peng Wenying consistently opposed socialism, falsely claiming that the China Democratic League's acceptance of the Party's leadership was surrendering to the Chinese Communist Party.

    League members from the Shanghai Film Studio, the People's Art Theater, and the Peking Opera Theater revealed Chen Renbing's despicable behavior of going to their units to incite the masses to oppose the leadership. Tao Xiong said that Chen Renbing once posed as the nanny of the famous actress Yan Huizhu, putting on an attitude of fighting for justice, and provoking Yan Huizhu's relationship with the leadership. Chen Renbing blackmailed the leadership by saying, "If you don't arrange things well for Yan Huizhu, Yan Huizhu will go crazy, Yan Huizhu will run back to Hong Kong," demanding that the Party and the government invest the greatest capital in Yan Huizhu and her husband. Chen Renbing also used dances, dinners, and get-togethers to win people over as his political capital. He even brought Zhao Wang, a Blue Shirts Society secret agent, into the League. Tan Jiazhen said that the rectification campaign of the China Democratic League is a struggle that determines the political line of the China Democratic League. Our bookish League members have already been used as political capital, and we must carry out a serious struggle.

    At the meeting, some people also revealed that bourgeois rightists were already spreading rumors, saying that this struggle was just a gust of wind and would be over after the National People's Congress. They asked everyone to be vigilant. More than twenty people spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to continue the struggle against the bourgeois rightists until victory.

    The meeting approved the establishment of a rectification work group for the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League.

    民盟上海市委常委会扩大会议
    揭露罗隆基陈仁炳彭文应的小集团活动
    新华社上海30日电　29日下午举行的民盟上海市委常委扩大会议作出决定：停止民盟上海市委副主任委员陈仁炳、彭文应盟内的一切职务，责令他们反省。并建议民盟中央停止罗隆基、章伯钧的职务和陈仁炳、彭文应的中央委员职务。
    许多盟员在会上揭发了陈仁炳、彭文应和资产阶级右派头子罗隆基的密切关系，以及他们的小集团活动。薛葆康说，上海刚解放，罗隆基去北京前，曾找陈仁炳、彭文应和薛葆康等谈话，说他们都由罗隆基联系。以后，彭文应、陈仁炳就有计划地进行活动，组织“碰头会”核心组织，排挤进步人士，阴谋全部夺取民盟上海市委的领导权。宋惟惠说，1950年彭文应到北京开会期间，曾写信回来传达罗隆基和张东荪对民盟上海组织的指示。他要求彭文应、陈仁炳彻底交代和罗隆基的关系和他们的小集团活动。吴承禹系统地揭发了彭文应的丑史，说明彭文应是一个政客、市侩和恶霸，是罗隆基在上海的代理人。抗战前彭文应就和国民党勾勾搭搭，1937年秋蒋介石召开庐山会议时，曾经叫彭文应去参加。解放后彭文应一贯反对社会主义，诬说民盟接受党的领导是向中共投降。
    上海电影制片公司、人民艺术剧院、京剧院的盟员揭发了陈仁炳到他们单位去煽动群众反对领导的卑鄙行为。陶雄说，陈仁炳曾以名演员言慧珠的保姆自居，摆出一副打抱不平的态度，挑拨言慧珠同领导的关系。陈仁炳以“你们不安排好言慧珠，言慧珠会发疯，言慧珠要跑回香港去”来要挟领导，要党和政府对言慧珠和她的丈夫下最大的资本。陈仁炳还以舞会、聚餐会、联欢等拉拢人，作为他的政治资本。他甚至把蓝衣社的特务赵望也拉入盟内。谈家桢说，民盟的整风是一场决定民盟政治路线的斗争。我们书呆子式的盟员已经被人利用作为政治资本，我们要进行严肃的斗争。
    会上还有人揭发资产阶级右派分子已在放出空气，说这场斗争是一阵风，全国人民代表大会开过以后就完了。要求大家提高警惕。会上二十多人发言，一致表示同资产阶级右派分子继续斗争下去，直到胜利为止。
    会议通过成立了民盟上海市委的整风工作组。
