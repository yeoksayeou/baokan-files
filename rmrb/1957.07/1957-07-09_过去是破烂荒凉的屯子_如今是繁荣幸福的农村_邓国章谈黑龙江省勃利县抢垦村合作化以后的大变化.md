I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Li and Bo. Now I will briefly report to you, the representatives, on the situation of our cooperative.
	I am from the Qiangkeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Boli County, Heilongjiang Province. Our cooperative was established in 1952 on the basis of mutual aid teams. At that time, there were 14 households, 20 horses, and one cow, cultivating 60 hectares of land. In the beginning, the members supported the cooperative and had high confidence. They built ten houses, opened up ten hectares of wasteland, and bought ninety-six sheep. However, when working together, some people felt unaccustomed, thinking that it was "not as free as working for themselves in the past." They were unsure of how the cooperative would distribute profits, and some people's work enthusiasm was not high, taking on light tasks and avoiding heavy ones. At that time, we lacked experience and methods in our work, so we could not promptly educate and correct the members' shortcomings. As a result, the land was not well cultivated, and the grain harvested was barely enough to eat next year, with no investment for the following year, and owing the state 5,000 yuan. Therefore, some of the masses reflected that "cooperatives are not good," and some even discriminated against and attacked the members. However, we were not intimidated by these harsh words and difficulties. We summarized the lessons from the previous year, formulated various improvement systems, and the members expressed their determination to follow the path of cooperation and to run the cooperative well. Some poor peasants outside the cooperative felt that their individual efforts were weak and requested to join the cooperative. We absorbed seventeen poor peasant households and one middle peasant household. The households with money did not want to join, and investment was still difficult the following year. Therefore, we mobilized all members to invest 3,600 yuan in the cooperative to the best of their ability. Thanks to the leadership's experience from the previous year, improved operation and management, and some technological reforms, coupled with favorable rainfall in our county that year, we achieved a bumper harvest. Twelve hectares of corn yielded an average of 6,200 kilograms per hectare, and rice yielded an average of 3,000 kilograms per hectare. We repaid the members' investments and part of the state loan, deducted the investment for the following year, and distributed 1.7 yuan per work day, with an average of 470 yuan per labor force. The mutual aid teams and individual farmers said, "Cooperatives are still good." Many people requested to join the cooperative.

	In 1954, thirty-two more households joined. That year, we encountered a severe drought. Because the cooperative was unified in its management and labor could be transferred, we took many drought prevention measures, which meant that the yield that year still greatly exceeded that of the mutual aid teams. After deducting the investment for the following year, 1.5 yuan was distributed per work day, with an average of 350 yuan per labor force. Although the income this year was less than the previous year, the members were satisfied that they could still earn so much in such a dry year, and the masses envied them.

	Seeing that the cooperative was getting better and better every year, the vast majority requested to join in 1955. As a result, it developed from sixty-eight households to one hundred and eighty-three households, with only six or seven households remaining in the village that had not joined. In this way, the proportion of new members was very large. They were not yet accustomed to the cooperative's system and their sense of collectivism was not strong. Although the cooperative cadres had accumulated some experience in running the cooperative, they felt that they could not take care of so many households when they suddenly increased so much. The original division of labor and methods could not meet the needs of the time, and political and ideological education had not kept up. Therefore, the operation and management were somewhat chaotic, and there was a lot of wasted time and resources. We also encountered severe heavy rain, which resulted in more than a hundred hectares of land being abandoned. Although the harvest of the cooperative was still considerable under such severe disaster conditions, after deducting the investment for the following year and buying twenty-four good horses, an average of 1.47 yuan was still distributed per work day, with an average of more than 340 yuan per labor force. Forty-five thousand jin of rice alone was sold to the state.

	In 1956, all one hundred and ninety-three households in the village joined the cooperative, realizing the advanced cooperation of the entire village. The vast number of members saw the benefits of the cooperative from their own experiences. Therefore, everyone loved the cooperative as their home and worked diligently. Although one hundred and eighty hectares of land were flooded by heavy rain, a bumper harvest was still basically achieved, with 1.82 yuan distributed per work day and an average of more than 500 yuan per labor force. Of the one hundred and ninety-three households, except for two households that did not increase their income due to loss of labor that year, the remaining one hundred and ninety-one households all increased their income. The masses generally reflected: this is the benefit brought by cooperation.

	There are contradictions between the cooperative and the members, but they can be gradually resolved. For example, after cooperation, some members reflected that the vegetables from their own garden plots were not enough to eat. According to the needs of the members, the cooperative established a vegetable production team, which not only solved the problem of members eating vegetables at ordinary times, but also ensured that members had vegetables to eat in winter and spring. The elderly said they had no yellow tobacco to smoke, and women wanted hemp thread to use, so the cooperative planted one and a half hectares of tobacco and two hectares of hemp, which were distributed to the members in the autumn. Therefore, the members generally reflected: "The cooperative is our home."

	The development of our cooperative is just like what Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Cooperatives must be established in hard struggle." It is not all smooth sailing!

	Due to the development of the cooperative, the face of our village has changed. In the past five years, more than fifty public houses and seventy-one houses for members have been built, all with glass windows. The cultivated land area has been expanded by two hundred hectares (eighty hectares of paddy fields), and the current cultivated land area reaches six hundred and sixty-seven point eight one hectares (one hundred and thirty-six hectares of paddy fields). The number of horses has increased from the original fifty to one hundred and seven, and they are all good horses. There are seventy heads of cattle, which have changed from draft cattle to grazing cattle, and when they grow up, they are all sold to the state for slaughter. There are fifty pigs (not including those raised by the members themselves), thirty-five large carts, four sets of large horse-drawn farm implements, a small rice mill, twelve and a half hectares of afforestation, and six hectares of fruit trees (two thousand four hundred trees). The result of cooperation is that a dilapidated and desolate rural village has been transformed into a happy and prosperous rural village.

	Today, our lives are truly worlds apart from those before liberation. In the past, we ate chaff and vegetable leaves and our clothes could not cover our bodies. Now, not only can we eat our fill, but we can also eat 40% refined grains. Last year, there was a bumper harvest of rice, and each household ate 80% refined grains. Everyone in the village has clothes without patches, and everyone has a complete set of clothes and bedding. Young women even wear leather shoes, coats, and fancy clothes. Last year, we used the wool produced by ourselves to spin and weave one hundred and eighty sweaters and distributed them to the members. Many families have bamboo shell thermos bottles and clocks. Things that farmers had never seen for generations have now been achieved by the cooperative. This is the result of the Party leading the peasants to take the road of cooperation. On what basis do the right-wing elements say that the lives of the peasants have not improved?

	Looking at the cultural life, there were very few people who could read in the whole village in the past, but under the leadership of the Party, spare-time schools were established to eliminate illiteracy. Now, most people know three or four hundred characters. In 1949, there were forty students in the whole village, and now there are more than one hundred. In addition, a library and an amateur drama troupe have been established, and basketball sports have been carried out. Every day, sitting on the kang, you can hear news from all over the country on the wired broadcast. Why don't the right-wing elements see these facts and distort them arbitrarily? What are you up to? Who are you doing it for? You should explain it clearly. From the newspapers, I see that these right-wing elements are still unrepentant even with the help of many people, and some are playing rogue and planning to muddle through. This is impossible.

	Before liberation, it was common for poor people to freeze to death in the cold winter of the Great Northern Wilderness; since liberation, not a single person has. After cooperation, the five guarantees were implemented. For example, Zhang Yuehu, a member of our village's five-guarantee household, has a family of five, old and young, with no labor force. The cooperative gives them 1,800 kilograms of grain (wheat, rice, sorghum) every year, and distributes firewood, vegetables, tobacco, hemp, etc. according to the population, the same as the members, and also gives 180 yuan. He said: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, our family would have starved to death long ago, how could we let two children go to school!" This is the result of the Party leading cooperation, changing the era of poverty for generations of farmers in the past. Therefore, we peasants resolutely oppose the slanders of the Party by the right-wing elements, support cooperation, and are determined to follow the Communist Party and build a new socialist China.

	In order to fully tap the potential of agricultural production cooperatives, I hope that the Party and government leaders at all levels will strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, constantly improve the leadership level of cooperative cadres, help us improve the operation and management of cooperatives, enrich the strength of agricultural technology guidance, cultivate agricultural technical personnel for cooperatives, adapt to the needs of diversified operations, produce more grain and industrial raw materials, support the country's industrialization, and turn our new China into a great socialist industrialized country as soon as possible.

    过去是破烂荒凉的屯子
    如今是繁荣幸福的农村
    邓国章谈黑龙江省勃利县抢垦村合作化以后的大变化
    我完全同意周总理和李、薄副总理的报告。现将我们社的情况简要地向各位代表汇报一下。
    我是黑龙江省勃利县抢垦农业生产合作社的，我们社是一九五二年在互助组的基础上建立起来的。当时十四户，二十匹马，一头牛，种地六十公顷。开始时社员对社是拥护的，信心也很高，盖了十间房子，开十公顷荒地，买九十六只羊。但在一块干活时有的人感到不习惯，认为“不如过去自己干活的时候随便”，对社如何分配不摸底，有些人劳动情绪不高，拿轻躲重。当时我们没有经验，工作中缺少办法，因而不能及时对社员进行教育和改正缺点，结果地没种好，打下粮食将够明年吃，但没有明年的投资，并欠国家五千元的债。因此，有些群众就反映“合作社不好”，还有的人歧视、打击社员，但是我们没有被这些恶言冷语和困难所吓倒，我们总结了上年的教训，订出了各种改进的制度，社员表示坚决走合作化的道路，一定要把社办好，社外有些贫农感到自己干，力气单，要求入社，吸收了十七户贫农和一户中农，有钱的户不往里进，来年投资还是困难，于是发动全体社员尽自己的力量往社投资三千六百元。由于领导上有了上年的经验，改善了经营管理，进行了一些技术改革，加上那年我县雨水调和，取得了大丰收，有十二公顷苞米，平均每公顷产量达六千二百公斤，稻子平均每公顷收三千公斤，还了借社员的投资和部分国家贷款，扣出了来年的投资，每个劳动日分一元七角，平均每个劳力分得四百七十元。互助组和单干户说：“还是合作社好。”很多群众纷纷要求入社。
    一九五四年又入进来三十二户，那年赶上大旱，因为合作社统一经营，劳力能调开，采取了许多防旱措施，使得那年产量仍然大大超过了互助组，扣出来年投资，每个劳动日分一元五角，平均每个劳动力分得三百五十元。这一年虽然比上年收入少些，但在这样旱的年头还能收入这么多，社员感到满意，群众羡慕。
    群众看到合作社一年比一年办的好，一九五五年绝大部分都要求入社，结果由六十八户发展到一百八十三户，全村只剩下六、七户没入社。这样一来，新社员的成份占很大的比重，他们对社的制度还不习惯，集体观念不强，社干部虽然积累些办社的经验，但是对于突然增加了这么多户，也感到照顾不过来，原来的分工和办法，适应不了这时的需要，政治思想教育也没跟上去，因而经营管理有些混乱，窝工浪费很多，又遇到了严重的大雨，结果扔了百余公顷地。虽然在这样严重的灾害情况下，合作社的收成还是不少的，除去来年的投资和买二十四匹好马外，每个劳动日平均仍分一元四角七分，每个劳动力平均分得三百四十多元，光稻子就卖给国家四十五万斤。
    一九五六年全村一百九十三户都加入了合作社，实现了全村的高级合作化，广大社员从亲身的经历中看到了合作社的好处，因此，每个人都是爱社如家、兢兢业业，虽然被大水淹没一百八十公顷地，但仍基本上取得了丰收，每个劳动日分一元八角二分，每个劳动力平均分五百余元，一百九十三户中，除二户因当年失去劳力未增加收入外，剩下的一百九十一户全都增加了收入。群众普遍反映：这是合作化给带来的好处。
    合作社和社员之间是有矛盾的，但是它可以逐步加以解决。例如合作化后，有的社员反映：光靠自己园田的菜不够吃，合作社根据社员的需要，成立了蔬菜生产队，不仅解决了社员平时的吃菜，并且保证了社员冬、春两季有菜吃。老年人说没有黄烟抽，妇女要线麻使唤，合作社就种了一公顷半烟，二公顷麻，秋后分给社员。因此，社员普遍反映：“合作社就是我们的家”。
    我们合作社的发展，正像毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中所说：“合作社一定要在艰苦奋斗中建立起来。”它并不是一帆风顺的！
    由于合作社的发展，改变了我村的面貌，五年来盖公有房五十多间、社员用房七十一间，全是玻璃窗子的。扩大耕地面积二百公顷（水田八十公顷），现在耕地面积达六百六十七点八一公顷（水田一百三十六公顷），马由原来的五十匹发展到一百零七匹，并且都是好马，牛七十头，由过去的役牛变成了牧牛，长大了都卖给国家杀肉吃，猪五十头（社员自养的不在内），大车三十五台，大型马拉农具四套，一个小型制米厂，造林十二公顷半，果树六公顷（二千四百株）。合作化的结果是把过去一个破烂荒凉的农村，变成了幸福繁荣的农村。
    今天我们的生活和解放前比，真是天上地下，过去吃糠咽菜、衣不遮体，现在不仅吃得饱，而且还可以吃到百分之四十的细粮，去年稻子丰收，每户吃到百分之八十的细粮。全村每个人没有穿带补钉的衣服，每人都有成套的衣服和被褥，青年妇女并且穿上了皮鞋、大衣、花衣服。去年我们用自己生产的羊毛纺织了一百八十件毛衣分给社员。很多家有竹壳暖瓶、坐钟。过去农民祖祖辈辈也没有见过的东西，而今合作社办到了，这是党领导农民走合作化道路的结果。右派分子根据什么说农民生活没有提高呢？
    再从文化生活方面来看，全村过去识字的没有几个人，但在党的领导下，成立了业余学校，扫除文盲，现在一般的都认识了三、四百字。一九四九年全村有四十名学生，现在有一百多名。另外还建立了图书室、业余剧团，开展了篮球体育运动。每天坐在炕头上从有线广播里可以听到祖国各地的消息。右派分子为什么不看到这些事实，任意歪曲，你们安的什么心？到底是为了谁？应该交代明白。从报纸上看到这些右派分子在许多人帮助下还不悔改，有的耍无赖，打算混过去，这是办不到的。
    解放前在北大荒的严寒冬季里，冻死穷人是常事；解放后到现在，一个也没有。合作化后实行了五保。例如我村五保户张曰户，全家五口人，老的老，小的小，没有劳力，合作社每年给一千八百斤粮食（麦子、大米、高粱），与社员一样按人口分烧柴、蔬菜、烟、麻等，并且给一百八十元钱。他说：“若没有共产党我们这几口人早就饿死了，怎么还能让两个孩子念书呢！”这就是党领导合作化的结果，改变了农民过去祖祖辈辈贫穷的时代。因此，我们农民，坚决反对右派分子对党的诬蔑，拥护合作化，一定要跟着共产党走，建设社会主义的新中国。
    为了充分发挥农业生产合作社的潜力，我希望各级党政领导加强对农业生产合作社的领导，不断地提高合作社干部的领导水平，帮助我们改善合作社的经营管理，充实农业技术指导的力量，培养合作社的农业技术人材，适应多种经营的需要，更加多打粮食和生产工业原料，支援国家的工业化，把咱们的新中国早日变成社会主义的伟大的工业化国家。
