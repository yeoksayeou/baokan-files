    Advice to Kind-Hearted People
    Yang Mou
    Rightists have black hearts,
    A wolf in human form exists in this world!
    The hunter is chasing them closely from behind,
    Wagging their tails and begging for mercy, tears streaming.
    Kind gentlemen are too compassionate,
    Opening their book bags to hide the wolf;
    Once the hunter has passed, the wolf's nature is revealed,
    Baring its fangs and claws, even more rampant.
    Good and evil, right and wrong, must be clearly distinguished,
    The pursuit of rightists must be relentless,
    Resolutely strike them down,
    Not stopping until complete victory is won!

    劝告好心人
    杨某
    右派分子黑心肠，
    世间竟有中山狼！
    背后猎人追得紧
    摇尾乞怜泪汪汪。
    仁人君子太慈祥，
    打开书袋把狼藏；
    猎人过后狼性露，
    张牙舞爪更猖狂。
    善恶好歹要分详，
    追击右派要顽强，
    坚决把它打下去，
    不获全胜不收场！
