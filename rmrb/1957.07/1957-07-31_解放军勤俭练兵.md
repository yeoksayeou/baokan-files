The People's Liberation Army is promoting the glorious traditions of diligence and thrift in military training, implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in military training, and achieving remarkable results.

"An inch of time is worth an inch of gold." How to make full use of time and train our army into a modern and excellent revolutionary army as soon as possible is a question that the whole army attaches great importance to. The Air Force and the Navy have done particularly great work in this regard. Last year, the actual flight time of each pilot in the Air Force increased by 12 to 17 minutes per flight day compared with 1955. The pilots of the 2736 Unit's Second Branch increased by an average of 34 minutes. This year, new progress has been made in improving the utilization rate of flight days. The on-site time of ground crew has been shortened from 11 to 14 hours last year to 9 to 11 hours. The Navy has also made significant achievements in improving time utilization this year. Some ships have paid attention to combining duty performance with training. From mid-March to early April this year, the No. 311 ship carried out an 18-day transportation task. During the performance of their duties, they strived for 68 training hours. This will save some formal training time.

China has a large population and little cultivated land. Therefore, in setting up training grounds, all units try to occupy as little farmland as possible and make full use of training grounds. The 0064 Unit originally planned to purchase 6,521 mu of farmland as training grounds this year. Later, based on the spirit of diligence and thrift in military training, after careful study and reconnaissance by the leaders, it was finally decided to requisition only 26.45 mu of farmland, and make full use of barren mountains and river滩. This figure is only equivalent to one two hundred and forty-sixth of the originally planned purchase area.

In military training, especially in the training of the Navy and Air Force, the amount of fuel and equipment consumed is very large. A 2,000-ton combat ship consumes about 6 tons of fuel per hour at sea, and a bomber consumes about 1,000 yuan for fuel and bombs alone when it flies a bombing mission and drops three 50-kilogram bombs. Therefore, the Navy and Air Force pay special attention to saving fuel and equipment. Last year, the Air Force made great achievements in reducing the ground working time of aircraft engines, saving more than 6,880 tons of fuel. The saved working hours of aircraft engines are equivalent to 36 brand-new engines. The two savings are worth a total of 5.55 million yuan. Naval vessels also pay attention to saving fuel and equipment. The No. 307 ship adopted the use of economical speed during navigation. In a 130-nautical-mile voyage, it saved more than 2,200 kilograms of fuel. In 1956, a certain ship sailed more than 7,000 nautical miles more than in 1955, but used 1.8 million kilograms less fuel, equivalent to 720,000 yuan.

An important aspect of implementing diligence and thrift in military training is that all officers and soldiers use their brains to come up with ideas and methods, put forward rationalization proposals for training work and training equipment, and carry out inventions and creations. From 1951 to 1956, excluding the infantry, according to very incomplete statistics, there were more than 141,700 relatively important inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals in the whole army. These rationalization proposals, inventions, and creations have saved the country a large amount of resources, overcome the difficulties of insufficient training materials, and improved work efficiency and teaching effectiveness. Comrade Fu Changle of the Signal Corps replaced several carrier wave machines with the terminal amplifier of the three-route carrier wave machine, which can save ten machines, totaling 250,000 yuan. It can also save 240,000 yuan in rental fees for civilian circuits. Last year, the Chemical Corps used waste products to transform more than 114,000 gas masks, which basically solved the problem of insufficient gas masks in training. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, by the end of 1955, more than 99% of the regimental units had established rationalization proposal committees. Technical research groups have been established in hundreds of company units. (Attached picture)

    解放军勤俭练兵
    本报讯　中国人民解放军全军在训练中发扬了勤俭朴素的光荣传统，贯彻了勤俭练兵的方针，获得显著成绩。
      “一寸光阴一寸金”。如何充分利用时间，尽快地把我军训练成为一支现代化的优良的革命军队，这是全军上下十分重视的一个问题。空军、海军在这一方面进行了特别巨大的工作。去年一年，空军部队每个飞行员在每个飞行日的实际飞行时间比1955年增加了十二分钟到十七分钟。2736部队二支部的飞行员平均增加了三十四分钟。今年在提高飞行日利用率方面又有了新的进展。地勤人员的在场时间从去年的十一小时至十四小时缩短到九至十一小时。海军部队今年在提高时间利用率方面也获得显著成绩。有些舰艇注意到执行勤务和训练相结合。311号舰今年3月中旬到4月初，执行了十八天的运输任务。他们在执行勤务期间争取了六十八个训练小时。这样就能节省一些正规的训练时间。
    我国人多，已耕地少，因此在设置训练场地方面，各部队都设法尽量少占用农田，充分使用训练场地。0064部队今年原计划预购六千五百二十一亩农田作为训练场地。后来本着勤俭练兵精神，经过仔细研究，首长亲自勘察，最后决定只征购二十六点四五亩农田，尽量利用荒山、河滩。这个数字只相当于原来计划征购亩数的二百四十六分之一。
    在部队训练中，特别是海、空军部队的训练，需要消耗的油料和器材数量很大。一艘两千吨的战斗舰在海上航行一小时大约消耗油料六吨，一架轰炸机飞一次轰炸科目，投上三颗五十公斤的炸弹，单是油料和炸弹就值一千元上下。因此海军、空军部队特别注意节约油料、器材。空军部队去年在减少飞机发动机地面工作时间方面获得巨大成绩，节约了油料六千八百八十多吨，节省的飞机发动机工作小时等于全新发动机三十六台。两项节约共值五百五十五万元。海军舰艇也很注意节约油料器材。307号舰在航行中采取使用经济航速，在一次一百三十浬的航行中，就节约油料两千二百多公斤。某舰1956年比1955年多航行了七千多浬，却少用了一百八十多万公斤油，折合人民币七十二万元。
    贯彻勤俭练兵的一个重要方面，就是全体官兵动脑筋想办法，对训练工作和训练的器材设备，提出合理化建议，进行发明创造。全军除步兵以外，从1951年到1956年，据极不完全统计，比较重要的发明创造、合理化建议就有十四万一千七百多件。这些合理化建议、发明创造为国家节约了大批的资财，克服了训练物资不足的困难，提高了工作效率和教学效果。通信兵傅常乐同志改用了三路线载波机的终端增音器，代替几路载波机，可以节省十部机器，合计二十五万元。还可以节省二十四万元的租用民用电路费。化学兵在去年利用废品改造了十一万四千多件防毒面具，基本上解决了训练中防毒器材不够的困难。为了发挥群众的积极性创造性，各部队到1955年底止，99％以上的团单位都建立了合理化建议委员会。几百个连的单位成立了技术研究小组。（附图片）
