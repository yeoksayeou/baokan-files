    "Hell's Canyon" and the American Government's "Benevolent Rule"
    Shi Lü
    Speaking of which, some people may not believe it, especially those who think "the American moon is the roundest," probably even less so: America is a country that frequently suffers from floods and droughts. Not only are they frequent, but they are also severe. In the great flood of July 1951, half a million people were left homeless, with losses exceeding one billion US dollars. This year, Missouri, Texas, and Kansas have again experienced floods, causing widespread disasters and huge losses to people's lives and property. Droughts are also severe. According to American newspapers, approximately twelve million hectares of land in the United States are at risk of becoming barren due to years of drought and soil erosion. Farmers have suffered losses of billions of US dollars due to drought, with Texas alone suffering losses of 750 million US dollars last year.
    With today's technological civilization and the human and material resources that the United States possesses, it would not be difficult to eliminate these flood and drought disasters if the American government had a little concern for the welfare of the people. American newspapers estimate that to prevent the American people from suffering from flood and drought disasters, it would only require an appropriation of 63 billion US dollars for water conservancy projects. Although this amount is not small, it is only a fraction of the military expansion and war preparation expenses of the United States in the past ten years.
    However, the American government has been very stingy about water conservancy projects. Perhaps the American government has no interest in water conservancy projects at all? But that is not entirely true. Sometimes it is excessively active, and that is when it is "gilding the lily" for the moneybags of monopoly capitalists, in which case it is always very generous. A recent example is the so-called "Hell's Canyon" incident.
    There is a Snake River in the northwestern United States that frequently floods. To control this river and to provide the electricity needed for the development of the northwestern states, the people of the northwestern states requested the federal government to invest 400 million US dollars to build a high dam in the Hell's Canyon area (between Idaho and Oregon) through which the Snake River flows. The monopoly capital Idaho Power Company was unwilling to let go of the opportunity to seize profits, and it proposed a plan to build three small dams in Hell's Canyon. According to the design, the high dam has a power generation capacity of 1,124,000 kilowatts and can also serve as flood control and water storage; while the three small dams built by Idaho Power Company have a total power generation capacity of only 680,000 kilowatts, and the water storage capacity is only a little more than a quarter of that of the high dam, which cannot play much of a role in flood control. At the same time, if the project is invested and built by the state, the electricity charges of state-owned power plants will be much cheaper than those of private power plants in the future. Comparing these two plans, isn't it obvious which plan should be adopted? However, in 1955, the Federal Power Commission made the excuse that Congress would not allocate funds and gave the construction rights to Idaho Power Company.
    The matter did not end there. On April 25 this year, the US government's Office of Defense Mobilization announced that Idaho Power Company could enjoy preferential treatment under a regulation formulated during the Korean War to stimulate the development of defense industries. As former director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, Flemming, said, the construction of the Hell's Canyon Dam is not a defense project at all, and the Korean War has been over for four years, and the preferential treatment regulation expired at the end of 1955. But all of this does not hinder the American government's enthusiasm for soliciting business for monopoly capitalists.
    According to the preferential treatment method, Idaho Power Company can be exempted from income tax on 65 million US dollars of its total income each year for the first five years after the Hell's Canyon Dam is completed and put into production, and then pay the tax later after five years. According to the estimate of the Comptroller of the Federal Power Commission, Reinwater, the federal government will have to borrow money to make up for the deficit in these five years because it cannot receive this income tax, and will have to pay 83,595,287 US dollars in interest for nothing, while Idaho Power Company is equivalent to obtaining a five-year interest-free loan of 65 million US dollars, and get 25.4 million US dollars for nothing.
    Of course, the US government's large gifts of this kind are not limited to Idaho Power Company alone. According to US Senator Morse's revelation, in the past six years, the US government's preferential treatment to power companies alone has resulted in a total loss of more than 3.3 billion US dollars.
    In contrast to this generosity to monopoly capitalists, for example, during the great flood in the United States in 1951, the US government allocated less than 600,000 US dollars to "relieve" more than 500,000 disaster victims.
    So generous to monopoly capitalists and so stingy to the people—this is the "benevolent rule" of the American-style "democratic" government.

    “地狱峡谷”和美国政府的“德政”
    施旅
    说起来，有些人恐怕还不敢相信，特别是那些认为“美国的月亮最圆”的人恐怕更是不肯相信：美国是一个经常闹水灾和旱灾的国家。不但闹得频繁，而且闹得严重。1951年7月一次大水灾，使得五十万人无家可归，损失达十亿美元以上。今年，密苏里州、得克萨斯州和堪萨斯州又都发生洪水，泛滥为灾，人民的生命财产损失浩大。旱灾也很严重。据美国报刊报道，美国有一千二百万公顷左右的土地，由于连年干旱，土壤风化，有变成不毛之地的危险。农民由于旱灾所受的损失达数十亿美元，单单得克萨斯一州，去年的损失就达到七亿五千万美元。
    以人类今日的技术文明和美国所拥有的人力物力，如果美国政府稍有为人民谋福利之心，消除这些水旱灾害原是不难办到的。美国报刊估计，要使美国人民不再遭受水旱灾害，一共只须拨款六百三十亿美元，用来兴修水利。这个数目虽然不小，却不过是美国战后十多年来扩军备战经费的一个零头罢了。
    但是，美国政府对于兴修水利却表现得非常吝啬。也许是美国政府对水利工程一概没有兴趣吧？却又不尽然。有时候它又表现得过分积极，那就是为垄断资本家的钱袋“锦上添花”的时候，那它一向是十分慷慨的。最近的一个事例就是所谓“地狱峡谷”事件。
    美国西北部有一条经常泛滥成灾的蛇河，为了控制这条河，同时也为了提供西北部各州发展所需的电力，西北部各州人民要求联邦政府投资四亿美元在蛇河所流经的地狱峡谷区域（在爱达荷州和俄勒冈州之间）建筑一个高坝。垄断资本的爱达荷动力公司不肯放过攫取利润的机会，它提出了由它在地狱峡谷建筑三座小坝的方案。根据设计，高坝发电能力达一百十二万四千瓩，又能起拦洪、蓄洪的作用；而由爱达荷动力公司兴修的三座小坝，一共只有发电能力六十八万瓩，蓄洪量只及高坝的四分之一强，起不了什么拦洪的作用。同时，如果工程由国家投资建筑，将来国营电厂收电费，可以比私营电厂便宜得多。把这两个方案一比，应该采取哪一个方案，不是显而易见的吗？然而联邦动力委员会在1955年竟然借口国会不会拨款而把建筑权利让给爱达荷动力公司了。
    事情到这里还没有完结。今年4月25日美国政府的国防动员署宣布爱达荷动力公司可以根据在侵略朝鲜战争时期制定的一项刺激国防工业的发展的规定而享受优待。如国防动员署的前任署长弗莱敏所说的，兴修地狱峡谷水坝根本就不是什么国防工程，而且朝鲜战争已经停了四年，那项优待的规定也早在1955年年底就失了时效。但是这一切都不妨碍美国政府为垄断资本家揽生意的积极性。
    按照优待办法，爱达荷动力公司在地狱峡谷水坝建成并投入生产后的最初五年内，每年的总收入中可以有六千五百万美元免缴所得税，等五年以后再补缴。据联邦动力委员会的主计长雷因华特估计，联邦政府在这五年中因为收不到这笔所得税，将必须借钱来弥补赤字，由此将白白支付利息八千三百五十九万五千二百八十七美元，而爱达荷动力公司则等于取得了为期五年免付利息的六千五百万美元的贷款，白白得了二千五百四十万美元的好处。
    美国政府这类性质的大赠送，当然不限于爱达荷动力公司一家。据美国参议员莫尔斯揭露，在过去六年间，美国政府仅仅是对电力企业的优待，损失总数就达三十三亿美元以上。
    同这种向垄断资本家大慷其慨相对照，譬如，在1951年美国大水灾时，美国政府拨了不到六十万美元来“救济”五十万以上的灾民。
    对垄断资本家是那样地慷慨，对人民又是这样地吝啬——这就是美国式“民主”政府的“德政”。
