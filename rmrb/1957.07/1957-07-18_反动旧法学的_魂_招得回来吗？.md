Scientists, Act to Repel the Rightists' Offensive and Defend Marxism!
Can the "Soul" of Reactionary Old Jurisprudence Be Summoned Back?
Rui Mu

The "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System" proposed by the rightists is a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program. It specifically mentions political and legal science. This is a crucial gap that the rightists believe they have found in their attack on the Party, and one they feel confident they can breach. They are mistaken.

On the issue of political power, class enemies never relax. They hate the people's democratic dictatorship, democratic centralism, and oppose the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. They believe they must occupy a position in the field of political and legal science, cultivate potential, and seize any opportunity to restore the old order in order to attack the entire political power of the Chinese people.

They despise the theoretical principle that a people's revolutionary regime must crush the state apparatus and the entire legal system of hostile classes. They deny that law is a tool of class struggle. To put it more correctly, they deny that we use legal tools to suppress the enemy, but they are constantly using our laws to attack the people's regime. First, on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they believe that we have violated the legal guarantees of human rights. In addition, they say that our judicial work is a mess. They demand the establishment of a committee for suppressing counter-revolutionaries and reversing verdicts without the participation of the Communist Party, and want our political and legal cadres to "step down."

They resent our judicial reform and departmental adjustments in 1952. They demand that we change our attitude towards old jurisprudence, saying: "Some people believe that there is no social science in bourgeois society because those things previously called 'social science' are unscientific. Social science in socialist society must be created from scratch, with nothing to inherit. We can only criticize bourgeois social science, not accept it. We should not reform old social science, but abolish it." We say that the laws under reactionary rule oppress the people, while our laws serve the people. The establishment of the People's Republic of China destroyed the pseudo-legal system and abolished the old Six Codes. In this fundamental change, there is no question of inheritance. However, rightists like Yang Zhaolong even created the shameless theory that "bourgeois law has the people's standpoint" to justify the restoration of old jurisprudence. They took out a large number of bourgeois law courses and prepared to promote them, and openly said: "It's enough to teach them as we did before liberation."

The rightists attach great importance to protecting scientists. We also advocate protecting scientists, but the question is which scientists to protect. What is the intention of Qian Weichang and his ilk in placing the protection of scientists at the forefront of the issue? We say that in the political and legal field, this is a "soul-summoning" tactic of old jurisprudence, and the intention is extremely malicious and shameful. The rightists say that we have "struck down with one blow" the old legal personnel. "International law is about to become extinct." The infamous "Opinions on the Scientific System" stated: "Many people who used to study sociology, political science, and law have changed careers. Many courses have been canceled because the Soviet Union does not have them." This is a malicious distortion.

Since the People's Government took over all the old legal personnel, except for a portion who had made greater contributions to the revolution and were politically and ideologically sound and directly participated in the work, the rest were required to undergo reform. Anyone willing to actively reform was welcome to participate in the study. People who studied at the New Jurisprudence Research Institute and North China People's Revolutionary University have long since taken up their posts. However, among those who have studied old law, there are indeed countless people who are mortal enemies of the people, including politicians, hooligans, and the ignorant. Will these all be recalled? The rightists certainly want to recall them all. Their pockets are full of trusted lackeys. In Qian Duansheng's "Law School," before people realized his conspiracy, he had already arranged positions for his henchmen. In the Department of Economics at Peking University, rightists, in a short period of one year, proposed sixteen or seventeen people, the vast majority of whom had serious problems in their ideology and political consciousness, to be stuffed into the department. Is this the rampant attack of the rightists, or is it defending science? People can see clearly.

The rightists disagree with our policies and decrees. They clamor for "rule of law" for their so-called equality and freedom, they clamor for "rule of law" for their economic interests, and they clamor for "rule of law" for their shady dealings. They say our policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is wrong, our policy of agricultural collectivization is wrong, and our policy of fixed interest is wrong. Zhang Naiqi said that we have not given capitalists "equal rights as citizens," and therefore violated the constitution. The question is how to understand the "equal rights of citizens" in the constitution. We believe that we have already given capitalists equal rights on the basis of the necessary change in capitalist relations of production; Zhang Naiqi and his ilk are opposed to this. We say that our policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is very correct and very good, because if we didn't do so, our country would be destroyed, but Luo Longji, Huang Shaohong and their ilk firmly oppose this decree, demanding reversals and inspections.

On this point, the "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System" explains the reasons of the rightists. It says here: "Another bias in the social sciences is that policy measures or government decrees are often regarded as objective laws... Social science researchers should be encouraged... to provide opinions on policies and decrees." Is it that our policies and decrees absolutely do not allow people to offer opinions and criticisms? No. Is it that we have not made any mistakes in the implementation of policies and decrees? No, either. The intention of the rightists is obviously not these. They want to bring back the old legal personnel to attack the policies and decrees of the Party and the government.

The People's Daily editorial "Can the Party Not Issue Orders?" says it well: "Not only do the guidelines and policies in the work of the central government need to be led and formulated by the Party (in the process of leading and formulating, the Party first relies on the research of the experiences of the broad masses, and also attaches importance to consultation with non-Party members), but also in the localities and at the grassroots level, these guidelines and policies still need to be guaranteed by the Party to be correctly and appropriately implemented in accordance with specific circumstances, and the Party still needs to carry out a large amount of ideological and political work among the masses to transform these guidelines and policies into the masses' own thoughts and actions." Many of our important decrees were indeed formulated after extensive discussions, or promulgated after a period of trial implementation. In this process, we have also raised opinions. However, once policies and decrees are determined, they must not be shaken. These rightists are inciting political and legal scholars or other social scientists to first "not be satisfied with propaganda and interpretation," but to offer opinions regardless of occasion and order, and their intentions are conceivable. The rightists slander the people's social science for mistaking policies and decrees for objective laws, which is truly a slanderous accusation.

The rightists want to occupy a position in the field of political and legal science, restore bourgeois jurisprudence, and summon back the "soul" of old jurisprudence, their purpose is to openly oppose the policies and decrees of our Party and government, and to launch an attack on the leadership of the Party.

This shameful scientific program of the rightists is obviously anti-Party and anti-people. It takes the path of the bourgeoisie rather than the path of socialism. It opposes Marxism-Leninism and opposes the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, no wonder it does not mention Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party at all. This program is in fact an important part of the right-wing group's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy. The opinions it contains regarding political and legal science have nothing in common with the demands of our people's political and legal science. We must expose its conspiracy and resolutely fight its completely anti-people stance to the end.

We solemnly point out to them: no matter what means they use, the "soul" of old jurisprudence can never be summoned back!

### 反动旧法学的“魂”招得回来吗？

    科学家们行动起来，打退右派进攻，保卫马克思主义！
    反动旧法学的“魂”招得回来吗？
    芮沐
    右派分子提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”是一个彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的科学纲领。里面特别提到了政法科学。这是右派分子向党进攻中认为已经找到的对他们很有利而且认为很有把握以攻得进的一个重要缺口。他们是想错了。
    在政权问题上，阶级敌人是毫不放松的。他们仇视人民民主专政，民主集中制，他们反对中国共产党的领导。他们认为必须在政法科学领域内占一地位，培植潜力，随时复辟，以向中国人民的全部政治力量进攻。
    他们鄙视人民革命政权必须粉碎敌对阶级的国家机器与全部法制的理论原则，他们否认法律是阶级斗争的工具。说得更正确些，他们否认我们利用法律工具来镇压敌人，但随时随地却在借我们的法律来向人民政权进攻。首先在肃反问题上，他们认为我们违反了人权的法律保障。另外，他们说我们的司法搞得一团糟了。他们要求成立没有共产党参加的肃反平反委员会，要我们的政法干部“下台”“下轿”。
    他们痛恨我们1952年的司法改革与院系调整。他们要求我们改变对待旧法学的态度。说什么：“有人认为资产阶级社会里没有社会科学可言，因为那些过去被称为‘社会科学的东西是不科学的。社会主义社会里的社会科学要从头创造，没有可继承的。对于资产阶级社会科学只有批判，谈不到接受。对旧社会科学不是改造、而是取消。”我们说，反动统治下的法律是压迫人民的，我们的法律是为人民服务的。中华人民共和国的成立摧毁了伪法统、废除了旧六法，在这个原则性的变更中，谈不到继承的问题。但是右派分子像杨兆龙之流竟创造了“资产阶级法律里具有人民的立场”的无耻理论来为旧法学的复辟作张本。他们掏出了大量的资产阶级法学课程准备加以宣传，而且明目张胆地说：“只要像解放前一样教就够了。”
    右派分子十分重视保护科学家。我们也主张保护科学家，问题在于保护那些科学家。钱伟长之流把保护科学家放在问题的首要地位的用意在那里呢？我们说，在政法领域内这是旧法学的“招魂”手法，用意是十分恶毒与可耻的。右派分子说我们把旧法人员“一棍子打死了”。“国际法要绝种了”。那个已经是臭名昭著的科学体制意见书里说：“过去研究社会学、政治学、与法律学的人很多转业了。过去许多课程因为苏联没有就被取消了。”这是恶意的歪曲。
    自从人民政府把旧法人员全部包下来以后，除了一部分对革命较有贡献，政治上思想上较健全的人直接参加了工作以外，其余的一律要求进行改造。凡是愿意主动改造的，无不欢迎其参加学习。从新法学研究院、华北人民革命大学学习出来的人，很早都已走上了工作岗位。但是学过旧法的人里面，确有无数的与人民为死敌的人，有政客，有流氓棍子，有不学无术的。这些都将招回来吗？右派分子的确是想全部招回来的。他们荷包里塞满了心腹走狗。钱端升的“大法学院”里，在人们没有发觉他的阴谋以前，已为爪牙们安排好了岗位。北京大学经济系里的右派分子，在短短的一年时间内，竟提出了十六七个其中绝大多数在思想上政治意识上有严重问题的人，要塞进系里来。这是右派分子的猖狂进攻呢，还是保卫科学呢？人们是看得清清楚楚的。
    右派分子不同意我们的政策法令。他们为他们的所谓平等自由，叫嚣“法治”，他们为他们的经济利益，叫嚣“法治”，他们为他们的鬼鬼祟祟的勾当，叫嚣“法治”。说我们的肃反政策错了，说我们农业集体化政策错了，说我们的定息政策错了。章乃器说，我们没有对资本家给以“公民的平等权利”，所以违反宪法。问题在于如何理解宪法上的“公民的平等权利”。我们认为在资本主义生产关系必须改变的基础上已经给了资本家以平等权利；章乃器之流是反对的。我们说我们的肃反政策非常正确，非常好，因为不这样做，我们的国家会遭到灭亡，但是罗隆基、黄绍竑之流坚决反对这种法令，要求平反，要求检查。
    关于这一点，那个“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”里说明了右派分子的理由。这里说：“在社会科学方面的另一偏向是往往把政策措施或政府法令当成客观规律……应该鼓励社会科学研究工作者……对政策法令提供意见。”是不是我们的政策与法令绝对不准许人家提意见和批评呢？不是的。是不是我们在执行政策法令上没有发生缺点呢？也不是的。右派分子的企图显然不是指这些。他们是要把旧法人员招回来向党与政府的政策法令进攻。
    人民日报社论“党不能发号施令吗”里说得好：“不但在中央政府工作中的方针政策需要由党来领导制定（在领导制定的过程中，党首先依靠对于广大群众的经验的研究，同时也重视同党外人士的协商），而且在地方和基层，这些方针政策仍然需要由党来保证它们的正确的、适合具体情况的贯彻执行，仍然需由党在群众中进行大量的思想政治工作，使这些方针政策变成群众自己的思想和行动”。我们许多重要法令也的确都是经过广泛的讨论才制定，或者经过一个阶段的试行才公布的。在这个过程中，我们也都提过意见。但是政策法令在确定以后则不准动摇。这些右派分子鼓动政法学者或其他社会科学者首先“不要满足于宣传解释”，而要不分场合、不分前后地提意见，用意是可想而知的。右派分子诬蔑人民的社会科学把政策法令误为客观规律，真是血口喷人。
    右派分子要在政法科学界占地位，让资产阶级法学复辟，把旧法学的“魂”招回来，其目的就是要公开的反对我们党和政府的政策法令，向党的领导实行进攻。
    右派分子的这个可耻的科学纲领是明显地反党反人民的。它走的是资产阶级的道路而不是社会主义的道路。它反对马克思列宁主义，反对中国共产党的领导，无怪它对于马克思列宁主义和党的领导，只字未提。这个纲领事实上是右派集团反党反社会主义阴谋的一个重要部分。它所包含的关于政法科学方面的意见和我们人民的政法科学的要求毫无共同之处。我们必须揭穿它的阴谋，并与它的彻底反人民的立场坚决斗争到底。
    我们向他们严正地指出：不论他们用什么手段，旧法学的“魂”是再也招不回来的！
