Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 25th: According to incomplete statistics, the Indonesian Communist Party has already received more than 2,140,000 votes in the Central Java Provincial Assembly elections. There are still two regions and the Yogyakarta Special Region in this province where elections have not been held. In the last general election, including Yogyakarta, the Indonesian Communist Party received more than 2,090,000 votes in this province.

Now the number of votes received by the Indonesian Communist Party in Central Java has exceeded that of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, which received the most votes in the general election. However, the Nationalist Party has many voters in the two regions where elections have not yet been held. Among all provinces in Indonesia, Central Java has the second largest number of voters, second only to East Java.

The East Java Provincial Assembly elections will be held on July 27. The four major political parties are currently striving to win the election in this province.

In the last general election, the Islamic Teachers Association received the most votes in East Java Province, followed by the Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, and the Masyumi Party. More than 8 million voters cast their ballots.

The West Java Provincial Assembly elections may be held in early August. The dates for holding local assembly elections in other regions have not yet been determined.

    在中爪哇省地方议会选举中
    印度尼西亚共产党占优势
    据新华社雅加达25日电　据不完全统计，印度尼西亚共产党在中爪哇省地方议会选举中已经得到二百一十四万多票，在这个省中还有两个州和日惹特别区没有举行选举。而在上次普选中，连日惹在内，印度尼西亚共产党在这个省得票的数字是二百零九万多票。
    现在印度尼西亚共产党在中爪哇得票数字已经超过普选时得票最多的印度尼西亚国民党。但是在还没有举行选举的两个州中，国民党拥有很多选民。在印度尼西亚全国各省中，中爪哇省选民之多仅次于东爪哇省。
    东爪哇省地方议会选举将在7月27日举行。目前四大政党都在努力争取在这个省份中获得选举的胜利。
    在上次普选中，伊斯兰教师联合会在东爪哇省得票最多，其次是国民党、印度尼西亚共产党和马斯友美党。投票选民有八百多万人。
    西爪哇省地方议会选举可能在8月上旬举行。其他各地举行地方议会选举日期还没有确定。
