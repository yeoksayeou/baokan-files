    Commemorating the "July 7th" Incident
    Guo Moruo
    In the Style of Lu Xun's Rhyme
            Poem One
	Twenty years ago, in times of national crisis,
	China's lifeline hung by a thread so thin.
	We swore an oath at the altar, a white horse our witness,
	Wielding the yellow battle-axe to vanquish the foe,
	Pledged to bind the azure dragon and raise the red flag high.
	The great undertaking has achieved dual revolutions,
	The Long March, an immortal seven-character poem.
	The full moon over Lugou Bridge,
	Shines upon the farmers, richly adorned.
            Poem Two
	When the rightists rampaged with reckless abandon,
	Not a single thread of warmth could be permitted.
	Having already transformed the land into public property,
	Some petty demons dared to topple the great banner.
	Poisonous weeds must become fertilizer for the soil,
	Harmonious sounds are best for singing new poems.
	Do not forget the events of twenty years ago,
	Let us rise and dance, shaking our sleeves together at midnight.
?Chairman Mao’s Long March poem (“Mount Liupan” to the tune of Qing Ping Yue) ends with the line “When shall we bind the azure dragon?” The azure dragon refers to Japan. The east belongs to the color azure, and its mythical creature is the dragon.
?Refers to the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution.
?Chairman Mao has a seven-character poem entitled "The Long March." The victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan should be traced back to this.

    纪念“七七”
    郭沫若  
    用鲁迅韵
            其　一二十年前国难时，中华命脉细于丝。盟刑白马挥黄钺，誓缚苍龙树赤旗。?大业已成双革命?，长征不朽七言诗。?芦沟桥上将圆月，照耀农民衣锦衣。
            其　二右派猖狂蠢动时，温情那许一丝丝。已将率土成公物，竟有么麽倒大旗。毒草必须成粪壤，和鸣方好咏新诗。勿忘二十年前事，起舞中宵共振衣。?毛主席长征词（“六盘山”调寄清平乐）末句云“何时缚住苍龙”，
  苍龙即指日本。东方属青，其兽为龙。?谓资产阶级民主革命与社会主义革命。?毛主席有七律一首名“长征”，抗日战争胜利当溯源于此。
