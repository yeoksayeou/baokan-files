    Camera with Motor
    According to the May issue of the Japanese "Asahi Camera Magazine," a new camera called "Nikon S2 Model" has recently appeared in Japan. A small motor is installed in the back of it, and the motor is powered by six size three dry batteries. If you press the button for continuous shooting, it can automatically take more than two pictures per second in continuous shooting; it can also take single shots at the same time. Such a camera is convenient for remote photography operations, and is extremely convenient for animal photography, sports photography, and scientific photography.

    装有马达的照相机
    据日本“朝日摄影杂志”5月号报道：最近日本新出一种名叫“尼康S2型”的照相机，在它的后背中，装有一个小型马达，马达的电源用六节三号的干电池。如果按上连续摄影用的电钮，它能以每秒钟自动拍摄二幅画面以上的速度连续摄影；它也能同时进行单幅摄影。这样的照相机，便于进行远距离的摄影操纵，对于动物摄影、运动摄影、科学摄影等有极大的方便。
