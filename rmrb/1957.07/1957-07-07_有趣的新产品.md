    Interesting New Products
    Signal Matches
    In the dead of night, if a ship is in distress at sea, sailors and passengers can light signal matches for help. These signal matches emit a strong red light that can burn continuously for two minutes and be seen from ten kilometers away. Prospectors lost in the deep mountains can also use these matches.
    Signal matches are a recent product of the Shanghai Match Industrial Company. The first batch has already been sent to the maritime department for trial use. Their appearance is completely different from ordinary matches, as they are a foot long and have a wooden handle, somewhat like a torch. However, the ingredients used are similar to those of ordinary matches.
    Small Movement Alarm Clock
    Domestic alarm clocks give people the impression of being large and bulky. A batch of small movement alarm clocks assembled by the Henglida Clock Factory last month are only the size of a telephone dial, with cream-colored faces dotted with gold lettering.
    The movement of this type of alarm clock uses half the amount of copper compared to ordinary alarm clocks, while the precision of the mechanical structure is relatively high. Many parts are manufactured using methods similar to those used for watch parts.
    Henglida Factory began formal production of this alarm clock in mid-July.
    "Peony" Golden Pen
    A petite and exquisite new golden pen specially suitable for women—the "Peony" golden pen—was launched in June. The middle of the pen barrel is a double-layered transparent tube, so you can see at a glance if the ink inside is running out. There is an air layer between the two transparent tubes, so the pen will not leak even when exposed to heat.
    The "Peony" golden pen is another new product from the Xinhua Stationery Factory, which produces the famous "Eternity" brand pens. In the first half of this year, Xinhua Factory produced a total of five new styles of golden pens.
    Roadway Fluorescent Lights
    A type of fluorescent light designed to be installed on roads to beautify the streets was successfully trial-produced by the Huade Light Bulb Factory at the end of June. It is ninety-six inches long, twice as long as ordinary fluorescent lights.
    The brightness of the roadway fluorescent light is equivalent to a 300-candlepower light bulb, while the power consumption is only equal to that of a 70-candlepower light bulb. These fluorescent lights can be suspended above the center of the street or installed alongside the sidewalk.

    有趣的新产品
    信号火柴
    黑夜里，假如一艘船在海上遇难，海员和旅客就可以燃起一种信号火柴求救。这种信号火柴发出强烈的红光，可以连续两分钟不灭，十公里远的地方都能见到。在深山里失掉联系的勘探队员，也可以利用这种火柴。
    信号火柴是上海火柴工业公司最近制成的，第一批已经送交海运部门去试用。它的外形完全不同于普通火柴，长达一尺，还有木柄，有点像火炬。但是用的药料，和普通火柴差不多。
    小机心闹钟
    国产的闹钟，给人们的印象是又大又笨重。亨达利制钟厂上个月中装配的一批小机心闹钟，只有电话号码盘那样大小，奶油色的钟面上点缀着金色的字。
    这种闹钟的机心部分用的铜料要比一般闹钟节省一半，而机件结构的精密度比较高。许多零件都是用像手表零件的制造方法来制造的。
    7月中旬，亨达利厂就开始正式生产这种闹钟。
    “牡丹”金笔
    一种小巧玲珑，特别适合妇女用的新金笔——“牡丹”金笔，6月份已经问世了。笔杆的中部是双层的透明管，笔内墨水有没有用完，一望便知。两个透明管之间是空层，笔受热也不漏水。
    “牡丹”金笔是生产“永生”牌名笔的新华文具厂的又一种新产品。今年上半年，新华厂一共生产了五种新花式的金笔。
    马路日光灯
    一种装在马路上美化街道用的日光灯，6月底在华德灯泡厂试制成功了，它有九十六寸长，比普通日光灯长一倍。
    马路日光灯的光度相当于一只三○○支光的灯泡，耗电量只等于一只七○支光的灯泡用的电。这种日光灯可以吊在街心上空，也可以装在人行道旁。
