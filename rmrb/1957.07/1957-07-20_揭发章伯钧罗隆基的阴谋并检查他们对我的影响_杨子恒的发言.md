    Expose the Conspiracy of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji and Examine Their Influence on Me
    Yang Ziheng's Speech
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and all other reports of the Congress. I will resolutely implement them in my work and study.
    In order to draw a clear ideological and political line between myself and the rightists, I will use the exposure of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji's anti-Soviet, anti-Communist conspiracy, and examine my relationship with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, the influence of Zhang and Luo on me, and the roots of my erroneous thinking as the content of my speech today.
    I first met Zhang Bojun in Chongqing in 1942. At that time, Zhang Bojun sang the so-called "Third Road," advocating seven parts against Chiang and three parts against the Communist Party, with the aim of seizing some power for himself and engaging in an independent cause. At that time, I was a frustrated reactionary officer, and his high-sounding tune suited my taste, so I joined him. Soon, I joined the Third Party (the predecessor of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), and later transferred to the Democratic League.
    Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji's anti-Soviet and anti-Communist stance has historical roots. They have deep-seated middle-of-the-road line and old democratic reactionary thinking. In 1946, they signed the agreement at the Old Political Consultative Conference. Luo Longji often associated with Marshall at that time and had many illusions about the United States. Zhang and Luo's political lines were completely consistent, but in order to compete for the leadership of the Democratic League, they often attacked each other and quarreled endlessly.
    Wanting One-Third of the Country
    In 1947, when I was in Hong Kong, Zhang Bojun estimated that it would take a long time for the Liberation War to achieve a complete victory. Therefore, he decided to send me, representing the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, along with Yin, a representative of another democratic party, to organize a "Democratic Action Committee" to secretly carry out military activities, attempting to build up some strength for himself. At that time, Zhang Bojun proposed that China should implement a federal system, advocating dividing the country into three parts: the Communist Party governing north of the Yangtze River, a certain group governing the southwest, and him governing the southeast. His set of ideas and practices were highly valued by Marshall.
    After the nationwide liberation, the People's Republic of China was established. Zhang Bojun once discussed with me whether it would be better to participate in work in the central government or in the local government. I expressed my willingness to return to Gansu at that time, and he agreed very much, saying that you are a local, familiar with the personnel, and it would be useful to go back to work. He didn't directly say what the "use" was at the time. Looking at it today, it was to have me be his cheerleader, to support him.
    In 1953, the Democratic League held its Seventh Plenary Session, deciding to develop the organization. He said that the Democratic League's charter stipulates that it mainly unites and educates intellectuals, and if it is to unite, it must develop. In early 1953, I greatly developed the Democratic League organization in Gansu. As of now, there are more than 1,500 members of the Democratic League in Gansu. Zhang Bojun believed that it was very good that the Democratic League organization had developed so quickly in Gansu, a region with few intellectuals, and he repeatedly praised me. And my idea at the time was to absorb more intellectuals, so that I could have more followers. This idea was completely in line with Zhang Bojun's thinking.
    Skilled in Peddling Reactionary Ideas
    After that, I would come to Beijing once or even several times every year, and meet with him when I came to Beijing. He would always invite comrades from other provinces to his home for dinner, and before and after the meal, he would talk eloquently about major domestic and international events. He had a set of speaking skills, he could cater to people's tastes, one set for A and another set for B, truly "teaching according to talent." Some of the things he talked about, I always felt made some sense. Some of them were also good words, such as taking the socialist road, supporting the Communist Party, etc. He often sold his reactionary ideas and spread his harmful toxins under the guise of many good words. He once said that people like us should not hope to join the Communist Party. He even openly hinted to me that you are able to be a department head, a people's committee member, and a people's representative in Gansu today because of the relationship between the Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, otherwise you would not have made it. He also said that before the first CPPCC conference in 1949, when studying the nomination of representatives, the Communist Party did not agree to nominate me, and it was only because of his firm support that I was nominated. Obviously, his intention was to sow discord between me and the Party. Once when I came to Beijing, at his home (besides me, there were several other people, I can't remember their names), he complained on the spot, saying that some people in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party did not obey him and said strange things about him. In fact, if it were not for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the Democratic League, these people would have no way out. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, if you are slightly not good, you will be sent to labor reform. Labor reform is the only way out. Undoubtedly, his kind of complaining threat is also a method of slandering the Communist Party and promoting himself. He meant that you should follow me obediently, otherwise you will be sent to labor reform.
    Dissatisfied with What? Satisfied with What?
    In 1955, after the National People's Congress, I went to Zhang Bojun's home. There were three people present, including Deng Haoming from Jiangsu and Li Shihao from Zhejiang. Zhang said to us that in the current situation, it is okay to speak openly in the central government, but those of you who work in the local government should listen more and speak less. If you say something wrong, your pigtails will be grabbed and it will be difficult to untangle them for a long time. He also said that in Britain, anyone can give speeches and scold the Prime Minister on the streets and in the parks, and no one will interfere, and there will be no consequences. At most, no one will listen. He also said that the Communist Party controls the democratic parties very tightly, and even more tightly controls the democratic parties in the local areas. In the local areas, non-Party members cannot decide anything. He was very dissatisfied with this, and in front of us, he nitpicked at some of the shortcomings of the Party members, making sharp "criticisms." His method of clear "concern," hidden provocation, and secretly peddling capitalist goods completely exposed Zhang Bojun as a double-dealer.
    Another time, Zhang Bojun once said that there are now more than 10 million Communist Party members, and after three years of joining the Party, they are all qualified to be promoted. In this way, non-Party members will have no status. Another time, at a dinner at the New Qiao Hotel, there were many people present. He said that now everyone wants to become "families," and if you become "families," you can still find a job. Secondly, there are literati, who can go to the local area as members of the Museum of Culture and History. The results of some comrades are very tragic. A comrade joked on the spot, saying: Yang Ziheng is a "dancing expert," and Zhang Bojun is a "political street walker." This joke is very realistic. Zhang Bojun is indeed a "political street walker."
    In July 1956, after the third session of the National People's Congress, he invited more than 20 central committee members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, including Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Yan Xinmin, Zhang Yunchuan, Han Zhao'e, Yang Yitang, Wang Yifan, Wang Jiyi, Xu Binru, Yang Qingyuan, Zhou Gucheng, and me, to his home for dinner. After the meal, he said that the democratic parties could be independent in organization and free in politics in the future, and that Minister Li Weihan had said that Communist Party members participating in leadership positions in various democratic parties would have to withdraw from their leading positions in the democratic parties in the future. The purpose of his saying this was obviously to try to put up a legal guise to exclude Communist Party members within the democratic parties.
    This April, the Central Committee of the Democratic League held a working conference. Zhang Bojun made a report at the meeting, in which he openly expressed great interest in Tito, but expressed great dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union. He also said: "I love the Communist Party, and I also love the democratic parties; of course, we must take the socialist road, but we must also have democracy." This is a naked expression of his revisionist thinking. Luo Longji said at this meeting that intellectuals were hurt in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and that letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend could restore the vitality of intellectuals. It can be seen here that Luo Longji's plan to establish a "rehabilitation committee" has been around for a long time. The basic spirit of this meeting of the Democratic League was to criticize conservatism and vigorously develop the organization.
    "Leaders" of Two "Large Parties"
    After the Democratic League meeting, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held its Third Plenary Session. Zhang Bojun proposed that Huang Qixiang be the vice chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Some people opposed it, but the opposition failed. This meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was also a meeting for great development. After the meeting, it was decided to establish organizations in major cities. Zhong Dai, the deputy director of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and

### 揭发章伯钧罗隆基的阴谋并检查他们对我的影响  杨子恒的发言

    揭发章伯钧罗隆基的阴谋并检查他们对我的影响
    杨子恒的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。我要在工作和学习中坚决贯彻执行。
    为了与右派分子划清思想和政治界限，我今天用揭发章伯钧、罗隆基的反苏、反共阴谋，并检查我同章伯钧、罗隆基的关系，章、罗对我的影响，以及我的错误思想的根源，作为我发言的内容。
    我是一九四二年在重庆与章伯钧初次见面的。当时，章伯钧高唱所谓“第三条路线”，主张七分反蒋、三分反共，目的就是为自己抓一把力量，搞一个独立的事业。那时，我是一个失意的反动军官，他的这种高调正合我的胃口，因而就同他结合起来。不久，我加入了第三党（农工民主党前身），以后又转入民主同盟。
    章伯钧、罗隆基的反苏、反共是有历史根源的，他们有深厚的中间路线和旧民主的反动思想。一九四六年他们在旧政协签过字。罗隆基那时常同马歇尔交往，对美国颇有幻想。章、罗二人的政治路线完全一致，不过为了争夺民盟的领导权，经常互相攻击、吵嚷不休。
    想三分天下有其一
    一九四七年我在香港，章伯钧估计解放战争要全面胜利时间还要很长，因此，他决定派我代表农工民主党同另一个民主党派的尹某，组织了一个“民主行动委员会”，秘密进行军事活动，企图为自己搞一些势力。那时，章伯钧即提出中国要搞联邦制，主张三分天下：共产党治长江以北，某一方面治西南，他治东南。他的这一套想法和作法，很受马歇尔的重视。
    全国解放以后，中华人民共和国成立，章伯钧曾同我商量究竟在中央参加工作好还是在地方工作好。我当时表示愿意回甘肃，他非常同意，并说你是地方人，人事熟悉，回去工作有作用。究竟有什么“作用”当时没有直说。今天看来，那就是要我给他当啦啦队，对他起捧场的作用。
    一九五三年民盟召开七中全会，决定发展组织，他说民盟的盟章规定主要是团结、教育知识分子，既要团结就要发展。一九五三年初，我把甘肃民盟组织大发展了一下。截至现在甘肃民盟盟员已达一千五百多人。章伯钧认为，在甘肃这样一个知识分子不多的地区，民盟组织发展这样快是很好的，他对我一再夸奖。而我当时的想法是，多吸收些知识分子，自己也可以多有些群众。这个思想完全是与章伯钧的思想符合的。
    贩卖反动思想有术
    以后，我每年总要来北京一次甚至几次，来北京就同他见面。他对外省来京的同志，每次来总是要请到他家去吃饭，吃饭前后，他便高谈阔论，谈国内外大事。他有一套谈话的本领，他能适应人的口味，对甲是一套，对乙又是一套，真可谓“因才施教”。他谈的一些东西，我听了总觉得有些道理。其中也有些是好话，比如走社会主义、拥护共产党等等，他往往就是在许多好话的掩饰下，贩卖他的反动思想，散布他的有害的毒素。他曾经说，像我们这些人，就不要希望加入共产党了。甚至公然当面对我暗示说，你今天能在甘肃当一个厅长、人民委员、人民代表，这都是民盟和农工民主党的关系，不然你就弄不上。他还说，一九四九年开第一次政协会前，研究代表的提名，共产党不同意提我，是由于他的坚决支持才把我提上。很明显，他的用意就是挑拨我同党的关系。有一次我来北京，在他家里（除我外还有好几人，人名字记不清了），他当场大发牢骚，说农工民主党有些人不服从他，讲他的怪话，其实，如果不是农工民主党、民盟，这些人就毫无出路，在共产党的领导下，你要稍微不好就是劳改。劳改就是出路。无疑的，他的这种牢骚式的威胁，也就是一种诋毁共产党、提高他自己的一种手法。他的意思是说，你们要乖乖的跟着我走，否则就是劳改。
    不满意什么？满意什么？
    一九五五年人民代表大会后，我到章伯钧家，在场的有三人，其中有江苏的邓昊明、浙江的李士豪。章对我们说，现在的情况，在中央说话还可以公开，你们在地方搞工作的，就是要多听少说，如果说错了，小辫子被人抓住，好久也解不开。又说，在英国，不管谁都可以随便在马路上、公园里讲演，叫骂首相也无人干涉，也没有什么后患，充其量没人听就是了。他还说，共产党对民主党派管得很紧，对地方的民主党派管得更紧，地方上什么事都非党员决定不可。他对此非常不满，并当着我们的面挑剔一些党员的缺点，尖锐“批评”。他的这种明“关怀”、暗挑拨、偷偷贩运资本主义货色的手法，完全暴露了章伯钧是一个两面派。
    还有一次，章伯钧曾说，现在有一千多万共产党员，入党三年后都有了资格，地位都要升一升，这样党外人士就没地位了。另一次，在新侨饭店吃饭，在场的人很多，他说，现在大家都要成“家”，成“家”了还可以找个饭碗，其次是文人，可到地方当个文史馆员，有些同志的结果就很惨了。当场就有同志开玩笑说：杨子恒是“跳舞专家”，章伯钧是“马路政客家”。这个玩笑倒很现实，章伯钧的确是一个“马路政客”。
    一九五六年七月，人大第三次会后，他请了二十多位农工民主党的中央委员，其中有黄琪翔、李伯球、严信民、张云川、韩兆鹗、杨逸棠、王一帆、王寄一、徐彬如、杨清源、周谷城等，还有我，在他家吃饭。饭后他说，民主党派以后组织上可以独立，政治上可以自由，并说李维汉部长说过，参加各民主党派作领导工作的共产党员，今后都要退出在民主党派的领导岗位。他说这话的用意，显然是企图打起合法的幌子，排斥在民主党派内部的共产党员。
    今年四月，民盟中央召开工作会议，章伯钧在会上作报告，他公开表示对铁托很有兴趣，而对苏联则大表不满。他还说：“我爱共产党，也爱民主党派；固然要走社会主义道路，但是也要民主”。这是他修正主义思想的露骨的表现。罗隆基在这次会则说，知识分子在肃反中伤了元气，百花齐放、百家争鸣可以把知识分子的元气恢复起来。这里可以看出，罗隆基要成立“平反委员会”的打算是由来已久了。民盟这次会议的基本精神，就是批判保守，大力发展组织。
    两个“大党”的“领袖”
    民盟会后，农工民主党开三中全会，章伯钧提出让黄琪翔当农工民主党的副主席，有人反对，但未反对掉。农工民主党的这次会议，也是大发展的会议。会后决定在各大城市建立组织。农工民主党中央组织部副部长钟岱当面给我说兰州也要建立，我当时也同意了，章伯钧当时决定陕西让韩兆鹗搞，甘肃让我搞，并派张云川到河南，王一帆到东北。但我说我自己没时间，我不能搞，最好要别人搞。我还说，兰州只有两个农工民主党党员，一是朱镜堂，一是我。我提议让朱镜堂搞，并恢复朱原来的候补中央委员。后来因为没条件，没有搞起来。这里可以看出，他竭力扩大农工民主党的组织，又竭力支持黄琪翔当农工民主党的副主席，在民盟内部又搞章、罗联盟，这就是说，这样一来，他就成为两个“大党”的领袖，两个大党都可由他一手操纵了。
    今年五月，党的整风运动开始了，光明日报派两位记者到了兰州，带有民盟中央给民盟甘肃组织的介绍信，信上主要说为了了解西北“鸣”“放”的材料，充实光明日报的内容。这两位记者在兰州同我谈了两次：一次是刚到时介绍来意；一次是让我帮助他们确定采访对象、解决交通工具。两次谈话民盟甘肃省委秘书长陈伯鸿同志都在场。关于采访对象我未提具体意见，我建议他自己去联系。最后，确定以“光明日报记者招待座谈会”的名义，组织一次座谈，民盟甘肃省委给他印发了通知，在兰州饭店租了会场，并派一位总务同志负责招待。这次座谈共十二人参加，民盟成员参加的有兰州大学的王景尊，西北师院的李化方、刘钟瑜，兽医学院的朱宣人，西北科学分院的周光。这次座谈，实际上就是点火，而民盟甘肃省委，可以说对这次点火作了大力支持，起了有力的组织作用。
    今年五月三十日下午，章伯钧约了有我在内的十几人如黄琪翔、李伯球、严信民、王一帆、王寄一、杨清源、王枕心、杨逸棠、徐彬如、丘哲等，在文化俱乐部吃饭。饭前，章伯钧首先对文字改革表示不满，他说了许多话，我只记得他说“爱”字把心去了，没有心拿什么爱呢？此外，他还说，中国六亿人口，共产党员可以发展到两千万，各民主党派可以发展几百万，民盟也可以发展个百二八十万。由此可以看出，他处处反对党的措施，又时时显出了他的勃勃的野心。
    章说的好话坏话我都能听进去，我想的说的也和章罗不约而同
    现在，我来检查一下我个人的错误思想。
    章伯钧是七分反蒋、三分反共，搞第三条路线起家的。我参加了章伯钧的第三党，又同章伯钧在一起来往十来年，章的话，好的、坏的我都能听进去，这说明我思想上、言论上都接受了章伯钧的严重影响。也说明我也有反共的思想根源。我在甘肃的一些想法、说法，有时就同章、罗不约而同。比如我曾说，共产党只要把方针一定人人都会走，还曾说：党的领导好比是坐汽车的，坐汽车的不一定要开汽车，有些党员一定要开，结果撞了车。这些说法，实际上就是否认党的领导，不相信党的领导。对于一九五五年的肃反运动，我虽然嘴里没有公开讲什么，但内心里曾经想，文件上说“肃清一切反革命分子，不冤枉一个好人”，但我总觉得有一些人是冤枉了。去年，高健君同志主持在省政协开了一次座谈会，会上我提了两个意见：第一个是说，封建时代，三十岁以上的人才能当县长，青年有才者可以中状元，但不能当县长。提这个意见的原因，是因为我看到县级干部都很年青，阅历浅，不了解群众生活。我还建议每一个县至少要有一个老练的干部。第二个意见是说，参事室有一些年富力强的人，闲摆下是个浪费，应当把他们分配下去当副县长或副专员。这在当时来说我自以为还是好意，但在群众中起了不好的影响，很可能使人感到杨子恒就看到的问题，党却看不见。今年五月二十二日，在甘肃省委举行的民族统战座谈会上，我又说，有些党员常常强调说党员有党员的立场，这话不一定对，这岂不是一千二百万党员一个立场，五亿九千万人民又一个立场了吗？应当把一千二百万党员同五亿九千万人民作为一个立场。还曾说，我在地方工作共有六个上司，要受六个单位的指导，要过六道关。这许许多多言论，都是极其错误的。我的这些错误思想、错误言论，是与章伯钧、罗隆基的思想一致的。章、罗等野心家正想找我这样的人。更其错误的是，今年六月底，这时反右派斗争已经开始，农工民主党中央执行局召开扩大会议，讨论党内整风问题，会上我还发言说，在运动中，敌我矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，办法就是肃反，人民内部的矛盾是非对抗性的矛盾，办法就是整风。整风就不能一棍子打死。这话表面看来没什么，实际上是为章伯钧辩护。这个意见，甘肃代表组的同志们对我进行了批判，我才感到这是个严重的错误。事实上，这是一个政治上的大是大非，必须界限分明，不能有丝毫的含糊。
    野火烧身，归根到底是我的立场问题
    我是一个国民党杂牌伪军官出身的人，作过反动战争，在蒋介石摧残下，逼上梁山。我参加民主运动，参加民主党派，完全是为自己找出路，说不上有什么革命思想。直到今天，我的思想可以说浸透了资产阶级的油，因此，一遇资产阶级的火就燃烧起来。我痛切的感到，最近几年来我的思想反而更加落后了，具体表现在，当我听到有人批评共产党时，不管事实真象如何，我总是信以为真，并表示同意。我为什么不分析一下实际情况呢？事业发展这样快，发生一些缺点是难免的，我为什么偏偏不是这样想的呢？归根到底是我的立场有问题。我与章伯钧、罗隆基等虽然没有什么约，他们也没给我指示，但是我的思想同章伯钧、罗隆基的思想是很吻合的。这次人民代表大会期间，我进一步学习了毛主席的讲演，听了周总理的报告，我的头脑清醒了，才知道野火要烧了我的身。章伯钧、罗隆基这两个政治上的野心分子，身为国家的部长、人民的代表，又是民主党派的领导人，他们竟想点起野火，烧毁共产党，从而满足他们自己争权夺利的目的，把国事作儿戏。这种罪恶活动，我表示万分的痛恨。我坚决拥护共产党的领导，我坚决跟着劳动人民一起走向社会主义的道路，并要为扑灭右派分子点起的野火斗争到底。
    我的发言如有错误或检讨不够的地方，请代表们批评、帮助。
