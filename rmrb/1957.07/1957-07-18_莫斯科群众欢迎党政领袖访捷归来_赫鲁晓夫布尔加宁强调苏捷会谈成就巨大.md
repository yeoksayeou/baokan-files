Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th: After visiting Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Communist Party and government delegation returned to Moscow from Prague by plane on the afternoon of the 16th.

At the airport, Khrushchev, Bulganin, and the delegation were welcomed by Aristov, Brezhnev, Voroshilov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Furtseva, Shvernik, Pospelov, Kosygin, Pervukhin, and other party and government leaders, as well as representatives of the working people of Moscow.

Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who is currently in Moscow, also went to the airport to welcome them. After leaving the airport, Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet Party and government delegation immediately went to the Luzhniki Lenin Central Stadium to participate in a mass rally held by the working people of Moscow in their honor.

At the mass rally, two workers from the Moscow Small Car Factory and the "Paris Commune" Factory, and the Soviet writer Panfyorov spoke. On behalf of the working people of Moscow, they expressed their welcome and congratulations on the achievements made by the delegation during its visit to Czechoslovakia.

Khrushchev and Bulganin then spoke at the meeting. They talked about the delegation's visit, the results of the talks with the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government delegation, and the achievements made by Czechoslovakia in socialist construction.

Khrushchev said that the most profound impression left on us by this visit was that the Czechoslovak people everywhere showed sincere brotherly friendship and affection for the Soviet people.

Khrushchev pointed out that the working people of Czechoslovakia had made brilliant achievements in developing the national economy and culture during the era of people's power. He said that we are pleased to see that Czechoslovakia has done a lot of work in resolving national issues in the spirit of Leninism, eliminating the national divisions that existed in the bourgeois era.

Khrushchev said, is it not a clear proof of the victory of Marxism-Leninism that the Czechoslovak people have resolutely embarked on the road of building socialism, enthusiastically and harmoniously building a solid foundation for a new society? Isn't this a reliable guarantee that all mankind will sooner or later take the road that 900 million people are now taking?

Bulganin said that the visit was very successful and fulfilled all our hopes. In this meeting, the representatives of the Soviet and Czechoslovak Communist Parties were always in agreement on all fundamental issues of the workers' and communist movement. He emphasized that this time, the exchange of views in a cordial and friendly atmosphere confirmed that the views of the two parties were in complete agreement on all the party issues discussed.

Bulganin continued, when meeting and talking with the leaders of the Czechoslovak Republic, we discussed the issues of further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between our two countries, the unity and solidarity of all countries in the socialist camp, and some of the most important international issues. He said that we are very satisfied with the growing solidarity of the socialist camp. All attempts by the imperialists to prevent free people from building a happy new life will be shattered when they encounter our unity, just like hitting an iron armor, and they will still be shattered in the future.

Khrushchev's and Bulganin's speeches were constantly interrupted by applause.

    莫斯科群众欢迎党政领袖访捷归来
    赫鲁晓夫布尔加宁强调苏捷会谈成就巨大
    据新华社莫斯科17日电  苏联共产党和政府代表团在访问捷克斯洛伐克以后，16日下午由布拉格乘飞机回到莫斯科。
    在飞机场上，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和代表团受到了阿里斯托夫、勃列日涅夫、伏罗希洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克、波斯伯洛夫、柯西金、别尔乌辛和其他党政领导人和莫斯科劳动人民代表的欢迎。
    现在正在莫斯科的越南民主共和国主席胡志明也到机场上欢迎他们。离开机场以后，赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁以及苏联党和政府代表团的其他人员随即前往卢日尼基列宁中央运动场，参加莫斯科劳动人民为他们举行的群众欢迎大会。
    在群众大会上，莫斯科小马力汽车制造厂、“巴黎公社”工厂的两个工人和苏联作家潘费罗夫讲了话。他们代表莫斯科劳动人民对代表团在捷克斯洛伐克访问期间所获得的成就表示欢迎和祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁接着在会上讲了话。他们谈到了代表团这次访问的情况，同捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府代表团会谈的成果，以及捷克斯洛伐克在社会主义建设方面取得的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次访问给我们留下的最深刻的印象是，捷克斯洛伐克人民到处都表现出对苏联人民的真诚的兄弟友谊和感情。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在人民政权年代里在发展国民经济和文化方面取得了辉煌的成就。他说，我们高兴地看到，捷克斯洛伐克根据列宁主义原则的精神在解决民族问题上做了很多工作，消除了资产阶级时代曾经存在的民族隔阂。
    赫鲁晓夫说，捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决地走上了建设社会主义的大道，热情地、和睦地建筑着新社会的牢固的基础，难道这不是马克思列宁主义学说胜利的明证吗？难道这不是全人类迟早都要走上九亿人民现在所走的道路的可靠保证吗？
    布尔加宁说，这次访问非常成功，并且实现了我们的一切希望。在这次会谈中，苏捷两国共产党代表之间在工人运动和共产主义运动的一切原则性的问题上，意见始终是一致的。他强调说，这次，在亲切和友好的气氛中交换意见时证实，在所讨论的党的一切问题上，两党的观点是完全一致的。
    布尔加宁接着说，在同捷克斯洛伐克共和国领导人会见和会谈的时候，我们讨论了进一步加强我们两国之间友谊和合作的问题、社会主义阵营所有国家的一致和团结问题以及一些最重大的国际问题。他说，社会主义阵营的日益团结使我们感到非常满意。帝国主义者想阻挠自由人民建设幸福的新生活的一切企图碰到我们的这种团结，就像碰在铁甲上一样碰得粉碎，而且将来还是会碰得粉碎。
    赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁的讲话不断为掌声打断。
