    A New Page in China's Man-Made Fiber Industry

    The Andong Chemical Fiber Plant has already produced bundles of white, soft man-made fibers—commonly called artificial wool. This marks the opening of a new fiber resource for China's textile industry.
    The factory that manufactures this "wool" is completely different from a textile mill, its entire machinery and equipment resembling a general chemical plant. Inside rows of low factory buildings, there are many winding pipes and towering tanks. Thick cardboard made from wood pulp is transported to the factory and then placed in a workshop for moisture conditioning, ensuring the moisture content reaches a certain level. It is then sent to a caustic soda solution for impregnation and pressing, before being ground into fine powder in a pulverizer. This fine powder is sucked into a vulcanization tank via a vacuum conveyor and transformed into orange-yellow granules. At this stage, individual short fibers are no longer visible; it has become sulfonated cellulose. In caustic soda, it is dissolved into viscose. This honey-like viscose is filtered to remove impurities, air bubbles are extracted, and it is sent to the spinning machine through pipes. The troughs on the machine, filled with acidic liquid, contain spinnerets made of precious alloys. Each spinneret is smaller than an ordinary watch, yet it has a thousand tiny holes. The viscose is forced through these small holes, extruding into solid man-made fibers resembling lotus roots. One spinning machine has ninety spinnerets, capable of simultaneously extruding ninety thousand strands of silk. Each hole can extrude fifty meters of silk per minute. These strands are then cut, cleaned, desulfurized, oiled, and dried, turning into bundles of curly white “wool.”
    According to market needs, the Andong Chemical Fiber Plant can spin man-made fibers of varying lengths and thicknesses; fine fibers can be spun into high-quality woolen fabrics, while coarser fibers can be spun into sturdy and attractive yarn. Its cost is half that of natural wool. In high-end woolen clothing stores across the country, one can often see displays of high-quality fabrics and clothing produced both domestically and abroad, many of which are made from blends of natural wool and man-made wool, and some garments are made entirely of man-made wool.
    According to records of man-made fiber development, in the late 19th century, the British scientists Bevan and Cross successfully experimented with viscose rayon. Before 1930, man-made fiber production ranked third among textile industrial raw materials, after cotton and wool; by 1956, it had leaped to second place, accounting for about 20% of the total textile raw material production. Currently, China's textile raw materials are primarily natural fibers such as cotton, silk, wool, and hemp, with man-made fibers just beginning to develop.
    Various countries manufacture man-made fibers using methods such as acetate, cuprammonium, and viscose, extracting cellulose from short cotton linters, wood, reeds, bamboo, and wheat straw. Currently, most countries use the viscose method due to its lower cost. China's first man-made fiber plant also adopted this method.
    This plant is located at the foot of Mount Maokui in the suburbs of Andong City. It was built in 1939, but was damaged and shut down when Japan surrendered. Starting last summer, work began to restore and renovate the factory. By fully utilizing the existing factory buildings and equipment, and with an investment of just over 8 million yuan, the factory, which had been paralyzed for more than a decade, was repaired in a short period.
    The Changbai Mountains and the Xing'an Mountains in the Northeast region contain abundant softwood and hardwood trees with high cellulose content. These trees are excellent raw materials for making artificial wool. The water quality of the Yalu River is also very soft and suitable for washing artificial wool.
    Man-made fibers have broad development prospects in China. This factory will not only supply textile raw materials to the market, but more importantly, it will cultivate technical expertise for China's newly built man-made fiber plants.

    我国人造纤维工业新的一页
    新华社记者　赵春烈　鲁牧农　沈平
    安东化学纤维厂已经生产出一捆捆白色、柔软的人造纤维——人们通常所叫的人造羊毛。这是我国纺织业新开辟的一种纤维资源。
    制造这种羊毛的工厂跟纺织厂完全不同，它的整个机器设备同一般化学厂相似。在一排排低矮的厂房里，有许多弯弯曲曲的管道和矗立着的罐塔。用木浆制成的厚纸板运到厂里以后，就放到一个厂房里去调湿，使含水量达到一定程度，然后送到烧碱溶液里去浸渍、压榨，再把它送到粉碎机里绞成细末。这种细末通过真空输送机吸入硫化罐，升化成橙黄色的粒状体。这时，已经看不到一根根短纤维，它变成了磺化纤维素。在烧碱里，它被溶解成粘胶。这种像蜂蜜一样的粘胶，滤去杂质，抽掉汽泡，用管道送到纺丝机。安装在机器上的盛着酸性液体的槽里，有一个个贵重合金制成的喷丝头，每个喷丝头还不及普通的手表大，上面却有一千个微细的小孔。粘胶通过那些小孔，喷成像藕丝似的固体人造纤维。一部纺丝机上有九十个喷丝头，可以同时喷出九万根丝。每个孔每分钟能喷出五十公尺长的丝。这些丝再经过切断、清洗、脱硫、润油、干燥，就成了一束束卷曲的白色“羊毛”。
    根据市场的需要，安东化学纤维厂可以纺练出长短、粗细不同的人造纤维；细毛可以纺成高级呢料，粗的可以纺成质地坚实、美观的毛线，它的成本比天然羊毛低廉一半。在各地高级呢绒服装店里，人们经常看到摆列着国内外出产的高级衣料和服装，其中有许多就是用天然羊毛跟人造毛混纺成的，还有一些衣料是单独用人造羊毛织成的。
    据人造纤维发展资料记载，在十九世纪末，英国比凡、克劳斯试验成功了米胶法人造纤维。在1930年以前，世界纺织工业原料中的人造纤维，其产量次于棉、毛，占第三位；到1956年，它跃进到第二位，占纺织原料总产量约20％。目前，我国纺织原料都是棉、丝、毛、麻等天然纤维，人造纤维刚刚开始。
    各国制造人造纤维，采用醋酸、钢氨、粘胶等方法，从短棉绒木材、芦苇、竹、麦草中提取纤维素。目前各国大都采用粘胶方法制造，因为它的成本最低，我国第一个人造纤维厂也是采用这个方法。
    这个厂在安东市郊的帽盔山下。它建设在1939年，但是在日本投降的时候遭受破坏而停产。自去年夏天开始，动工恢复并改建这座工厂。由于充分利用了旧有的厂房和设备，仅用八百多万元投资，经过不长的时间，就把这一座瘫痪了十多年的工厂修复了起来。
    东北境的长白山和兴安岭一带，有含着大量纤维素的针叶树、阔叶树。这些树，就是制造人造羊毛的很好的原料。鸭绿江的水质亟软，也很适合漂洗人造羊毛。
    人造纤维在我国有广阔的发展前途。这个工厂不仅将供给市场纺织原料，重要的是要为我国新建的人造纤维工厂培养技术力量。
