Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. This year's national industrial production plan for the first half of the year has been completed very well. According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, by the end of June, the cumulative national gross industrial output value had reached 49.6% of the annual plan, an increase of 10.8% compared with the same period last year. This rate of development was achieved on the basis of a 31% increase in total industrial output value in 1956 compared to 1955, and a serious agricultural disaster last year.

Of the thirteen industrial ministries under the Central Government, all eleven ministries, except for the Ministry of Electric Power and the Ministry of Forestry Industry, exceeded their cumulative gross output value plans for the first and second quarters.

The production of means of production, especially the production of raw materials industries, continued to grow rapidly in the first half of this year, and the plan was also completed relatively well. The output of both steel and steel products has exceeded more than half of the annual plan, with increases of 24% and 41% respectively compared with the same period last year. In the first half of the year, a total of more than 2.49 million tons of steel were produced nationwide, more than one and a half times the total output of 1943 (over 900,000 tons), the highest annual output in old China's history. Compared with the first half of last year, other products increased as follows: raw coal increased by 7 million tons, crude oil increased by 93,000 tons, pig iron increased by 546,000 tons, and cement increased by 288,000 tons. The electricity industry also completed its sales target for the first half of the year, ensuring the needs of users; due to further reductions in plant electricity consumption rates and line loss rates, the power generation target was not met, but more than one billion kilowatt-hours more electricity were produced than in the same period last year.

Due to the increased production of these raw material industries, the tight supply of certain materials that occurred at the beginning of this year has now begun to improve somewhat.

The machinery manufacturing industry basically stopped the production of new-style agricultural tools in the first half of this year. At the same time, the state reduced investment in basic construction, and the supply of products needed by construction units was also reduced accordingly. However, the total output value of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing still increased compared with the first half of last year; the output of major products such as machine tools, generators, and electric motors increased by 15%, 22%, and 20% respectively compared with the first half of last year. In the first half of the year, machinery manufacturing factories in various regions also successfully trial-produced a large number of new products. Among them, such as the combined machine tool for processing C616 lathe headstock, the high-voltage giant power transformer with a capacity of 20,000 kVA and a voltage of 220,000 volts for long-distance power transmission, and the C8552 multi-blade semi-automatic steel ingot cutting machine, are all urgently needed in China's industry and are technically first-class products.

Food, textile, and light industries suffered natural disasters in agricultural production last year, and the supply of raw materials for some products, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and sugar, was insufficient, resulting in a decrease in production in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. However, as a result of vigorous efforts by various departments to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, seven of the eleven major products have completed more than half of the annual plan. Among them, sugar completed 58% of the annual plan, and the output of machine-made paper increased by 30% compared with the first half of last year. The textile industry department has also achieved good results in saving raw cotton. The quality of raw cotton used by factories under the Ministry of Textile Industry in the first half of the year was not good, but the average amount of cotton used per yarn piece was more than one kilogram less than last year, totaling a savings of more than 1.85 million kilograms of cotton. If all these saved cotton were made into cloth, an additional 13 million meters of cloth could be produced.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th. According to information from the State Statistical Bureau, the completed investment in national basic construction in the first half of 1957 was 3.69 billion yuan, accounting for 33.3% of the annual plan, of which the completed building and installation engineering was 2.32 billion yuan, accounting for 35.3% of the annual plan, which is higher than the same period last year. National construction and installation enterprises have also completed 38% of the annual planned workload, which is higher than in previous years.

In the first half of the year, the central ministries completed or partially completed and put into production 29 above-quota factories and mines, including seven belonging to the "156 Projects." These factories and mines were all built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. They are large in scale and technologically advanced. Among them are coal mines, thermal power plants, special steel plants, fertilizer plants, and pharmaceutical factories. Due to the commissioning of these key construction projects, as well as the completion and commissioning of many other construction projects below the quota, the nation's newly added fixed assets in the first half of the year were valued at 1.61 billion yuan. The newly added annual production capacity of major products under the central competent ministries are: electricity 63,000 kilowatts, coal mining 3.18 million tons, oil 194,000 tons, iron ore mining 300,000 tons, rolling mill capacity 180,000 tons, copper smelting and electrolytic capacity 9,000 tons, cement 450,000 tons, spindles 257,000, looms 12,000.

In terms of railways, the mileage of track laid increased by 295 kilometers in the first half of the year.

From 1953 to the first half of 1957, a cumulative investment of 40.3 billion yuan has been completed, accounting for 94.3% of the first Five-Year Plan. Based on the proportion of investment completed in the third quarter of previous years, which generally reaches more than 20% of the annual plan, it is estimated that the investment amount stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan can be completed four years and nine months ahead of schedule.

    今年上半年工业生产计划完成得很好
    总产值比去年同期增加10.8％，生产资料的生产增长很快
    二十九个规模巨大的厂矿企业全部或部分投入生产
    新华社20日讯　今年上半年全国工业生产计划完成得很好。据国家统计局初步统计，到6月底，全国累计工业总产值已经完成全年计划49.6％，比去年同期增加10.8％。这个发展速度，是在1956年工业总产值比1955年增长31％、去年农业又遭受严重灾荒的基础上达到的。
    中央十三个工业部除了电力、森林工业没有完成总产值计划以外，其余十一个部全部超额完成了一、二两个季度的累计总产值计划。
    今年上半年生产资料的生产，特别是原料工业的生产仍然增长很快，计划也完成得比较好。钢和钢材的产量都已超过全年计划一半以上，比去年同期分别增产24％和41％。上半年全国共计生产出二百四十九万多吨钢，比旧中国历史上的最高年产量1943年的全部产量（九十多万吨）还多一倍半以上。其他产品同去年上半年比较，原煤增产七百万吨，原油增产九万三千吨，生铁增产五十四万六千吨，水泥增产二十八万八千吨。电力工业上半年的售电量计划也已经完成，保证了用户的需要；由于厂用电率和线路损失率进一步降低，没有完成发电量计划，但是比去年同期多生产了十亿多度电。
    由于以上这些原料工业的增产，今年年初发生的某些物资供应不足的紧张状况，现在开始有所改善。
    机械制造工业今年上半年基本上停止了新式农具的生产，同时国家对基本建设投资减少，供应建设单位需要的产品也相应减少，但是，第一机械工业部和电机制造工业部的生产总值，仍然比去年上半年有所增长；主要产品如机床、发电机、电动机的产量，比去年上半年分别增加15％、22％和20％。各地机械制造工厂上半年还试制成功了大批新产品。其中如加工C616车床主轴箱用的联动机床，远距离送电用的容量二万千伏安、电压二十二万伏特的高压巨型电力变压器，C8552型的多刀半自动钢锭切断机等，都是我国工业上急需要、而且是技术上头等的产品。
    食品、纺织和轻工业因为农业生产去年遭受了自然灾害，有些产品如棉纱、棉布、食糖等原料供应不够，今年上半年比去年同期减产，但是由于各部门大力开展增产节约运动的结果，十一种主要产品有七种已经完成全年计划一半以上。其中食糖完成了全年计划58％，机制纸的产量比去年上半年增加30％。纺织工业部门节约原棉的成绩也很好。纺织工业部所属各厂上半年原棉质量不好，但是平均每件纱的用棉量比去年少用了一公斤多，总计可以节约棉花一百八十五万多公斤。如果把这些节约的棉花全部制成布匹，能多生产一千三百万公尺布。
    新华社20日讯　据国家统计局消息，1957年上半年全国基本建设完成投资额三十六亿九千万元，为年度计划的33.3％，其中建筑安装工程完成二十三亿二千万元，为年度计划的35.3％，比去年同期为高。全国建筑安装企业，也完成全年计划工作量的38％，比过去各年都高。
    上半年中央各部全部或部分建成投入生产的限额以上厂矿单位计二十九个，其中属于“一五六”项者七个。这些厂矿，都是苏联援助我国建设的。它们的规模巨大，技术先进。其中有煤井、热电站、特殊钢厂、肥料厂和制药厂等。由于这些重点建设工程的投入生产，以及其他许多限额以下建设项目的交工动用，全国上半年新增的固定资产价值十六亿一千万元。中央各主管部新增的主要产品年生产能力有：电力六万三千瓩，煤炭开采三百一十八万吨，石油十九万四千吨，铁矿开采三十万吨，轧钢机能力十八万吨，铜冶炼及电解能力九千吨，水泥四十五万吨，纱锭二十五万七千枚，布机一万二千台。
    在铁路方面，上半年铺轨里程增加二百九十五公里。
    1953—1957年上半年已累计完成投资额四百零三亿元，为第一个五年计划的94.3％。根据过去各年第三季度完成的投资额一般可达到全年计划20％以上的比例推算，预计四年零九个月即可提前完成第一个五年计划所规定的投资额。
