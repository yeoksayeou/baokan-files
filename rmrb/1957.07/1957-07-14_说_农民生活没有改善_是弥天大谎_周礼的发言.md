I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng, President Dong, and Chief Procurator Zhang.

Recently, bourgeois rightists have launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the government. Disguised under the pretense of "offering loyal advice to the Party," they insidiously and viciously obliterate the great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people, one of which is saying that "farmers' lives have not improved and they are living in misery." In order to shatter this unfounded slander, I would like to briefly introduce the development of industrial and agricultural production in Hunan and the improvement of farmers' lives over the past eight years. The materials cited here are mainly from the regular rural income and expenditure surveys conducted by the Hunan Provincial Statistics Bureau in 510 households in 34 counties, as well as the materials I obtained from inspections in eight counties. These materials are representative and consistent with the actual situation in Hunan Province.

Great Development of Industrial and Agricultural Production in Hunan

In the eight years since liberation, Hunan Province's industrial and agricultural production has greatly developed. From the industrial perspective, comparing 1949 with 1956, electricity increased from 1.06 million kWh to 45.71 million kWh, an increase of 42.1 times; raw coal increased from 100,000 tons to 2.86 million tons, an increase of 27.6 times; cotton yarn increased from 11,000 bales to 95,000 bales, an increase of 7.63 times; cotton cloth increased from 2.72 million meters to 75.04 million meters, an increase of 26.5 times. From the agricultural perspective, 1956 suffered the worst drought in nearly a century, with 8 million agricultural people and 11 million mu of land affected to varying degrees. However, even comparing the severely drought-stricken 1956 with 1949, the huge growth in agricultural production can be seen. In 1949, the province's total grain output was 12.8 billion jin, which increased to 20.6 billion jin in 1956, an increase of more than 61 percent. Cotton production increased from 140,000 dan in 1949 to 390,000 dan in 1956, an increase of 178 percent. The number of live pigs increased from 3.5 million in 1949 to 6.08 million in 1956, an increase of 73 percent. It is estimated that the number of pigs on hand by the end of this year will reach 8 million. In addition, the output of crops such as tea, rapeseed, peanuts, sugarcane, and ramie also increased by 60-70 percent or even more than doubled in 1956 compared to 1949.

Farmers' Lives Have Significantly Improved

Due to the rapid development of agricultural production stimulated by land reform and agricultural cooperation, the living conditions of Hunan farmers have undergone significant changes, with more than 90 percent of farmers experiencing varying degrees of significant improvement in their lives. To illustrate this fact, we can provide some necessary and vivid figures from aspects such as farmers' income, farmers' purchasing power and consumption of major living materials, changes in rural classes, and the development of cultural and educational undertakings.

87% of Rural Households Live the Lives of Middle Peasants and Prosperous Middle Peasants

First, let's look at the increase in farmers' income. In 1956, the average net income per farmer for the whole year reached 83.2 yuan, an increase of 30 percent compared to 1948, and an increase of 18.1 percent compared to 1952, when the national economy had already recovered. Relatively wealthy households accounted for 25 percent of the total number of farm households, with a net income of more than 90 yuan per person per year, equivalent to the level of prosperous middle peasants in the past; general households accounted for 62 percent, with a net income of approximately 70 to 80 yuan per person per year, equivalent to the level of ordinary middle peasants in the past; This shows that 87 percent of the families in the total number of rural households are living the lives of middle peasants and prosperous middle peasants. Another 13 percent of the households are relatively difficult, with a net income of 50 to 60 yuan per person per year, which is about the general level of the poor peasant class in the past. Most of them were originally the most difficult among the poor peasants, and now they have also improved significantly compared with before liberation. In addition, in some areas with better conditions and without disasters, many farmers have an average annual income of more than 100 yuan per person, and some even have more than 200 yuan. The average income is lower in some mountainous areas with poorer conditions and heavy disasters. For example, in Qiaotou Cooperative, Qiaotou Township, Xinhua, which suffered from drought for two consecutive years, the grain output in last year's autumn harvest decreased by more than 80 percent. After efforts to produce and help themselves and government relief, the average income per person was still 30 to 40 yuan. Under the principle of thrift and famine relief, they were able to maintain their lives and conduct normal production.

Rural Residents' Purchasing Power More Than Doubled in Five Years

Secondly, let's look at the increase in farmers' purchasing power and consumption of major living materials. From 1950 to 1955, the purchasing power of rural residents throughout the province, calculated on average per family member, increased from 15.9 yuan to 32.8 yuan, an increase of 106 percent. Regarding the consumption of major living materials by farmers, comparing 1936 (the year with the highest consumption in history) with 1956 (the year of the worst drought in nearly a century), calculated on average per family member, grain increased from 476 jin to 556 jin, an increase of 16.8 percent; edible oil increased from 3 jin to 4.5 jin, an increase of 43.8 percent; meat increased from 8.11 jin to 9.6 jin, an increase of 7.9 percent; edible salt increased from 8.8 jin to 13.3 jin, an increase of 55 percent; cotton cloth increased from 9.3 chi to 16.6 chi, an increase of 78.4 percent. The largest increase was in cotton cloth, and the smallest was in meat. If compared with 1949, the increase rate would be much greater.

Incomes of Poor Peasants and Middle Peasants Have Increased

Thirdly, let's examine the changes in the various classes in the countryside, because this change marks the development of agricultural production and the improvement of the lives of most farmers. According to typical surveys, 87 percent of the households of poor and hired peasants during the land reform have now risen to the level of upper-middle peasants or lower-middle peasants in terms of economic status. Comparing the average income per person of each class in 1956 with that in 1936 (the highest year before the war), the poor peasants and middle peasants, who account for the vast majority of the rural population, have increased significantly, with the poor peasants increasing by 41 percent and the middle peasants increasing by 9.4 percent; while the rich peasants decreased by 13.6 percent and the landlords decreased by 40.8 percent. Among the middle peasant class, the income of some wealthy middle peasants has also decreased slightly, because they had slight exploitation in the past.

The Number of Students at All Levels of Schools Has Increased Several Times

Finally, let's also take a look at the situation of cultural and educational undertakings throughout the province. Taking only the number of students at all levels of schools, in 1956, the number of primary school students was twice that of 1948 and 3.3 times that of 1950; the number of middle school students was 1.7 times that of 1948 and 4 times that of 1950; and the number of university students was 3 times that of 1948. From the end of the Qing Dynasty when Hunan began to have modern schools to the eve of liberation for more than 50 years, the area of school buildings built by secondary schools in Hunan was only 500,000 square meters, and most of these school buildings were converted from original ancestral halls, temples, academies, and examination halls. In the eight years after liberation, the newly built school buildings covered an area of 740,000 square meters, which is 1.4 times the total area of school buildings built in the past 50 years. Now, it is very common for a farmer's family to have two or three children attending primary and secondary schools. Just imagine, if the farmers' lives had not improved, would so many children be able to go to school?

The Living Standards That Have Declined After Liberation Are Those of Landlords and Rich Peasants

The above figures and facts undeniably show that the material and cultural life of Hunan farmers has been greatly improved. This ironclad fact cannot be obliterated by any right-wing elements who rack their brains. May I ask: can a precedent be found in any dynasty in history where 87 percent of the total number of farm households reach the living standards of middle peasants or above? Isn't it an outrageous lie for the right-wing elements to say that "farmers' lives are even harder than before liberation"? They are attacking the Communist Party in this way, and there is no reason to explain it except for ulterior motives. If there is any truth in the arguments of the right-wing elements, it is the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who account for a few percent of the rural population. These people can no longer oppress and exploit the farmers after liberation, and their living standards have indeed declined. As for the farmers who account for more than 90 percent of the rural population, especially the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, they clearly know who is good and who is bad based on their own personal experience. They wholeheartedly support the Communist Party and are determined to take the socialist road. They also have some opinions about the Party and the government, but they are only opinions on work. It is a daydream for right-wing elements to try to use these opinions on work to incite farmers to join them in opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism.

It Is Impossible to Miraculously "Leap to Heaven in One Step"

Of course, we must also soberly see that most agricultural cooperatives have only been in existence for more than a year. Although this year has withstood the test of severe drought, trained the members, and reduced the disaster, it will take a long period of time to engage in very arduous work to truly consolidate the agricultural cooperatives. Our family property is thin. Although farmers' lives have greatly improved compared with before liberation, generally speaking, the living standards of farmers are not high enough and there are still many difficulties. Our population is growing rapidly. In 1949, the population of Hunan was 30 million. In eight years, it has increased to 35 million, with an average annual increase of 2 percent. Our province has only 56.25 million mu of cultivated land. Although there is still some wasteland that can be reclaimed, there is still a feeling that the area of cultivated land is insufficient. At the same time, under the current conditions, the improvement of farmers' lives is unbalanced and not very stable, because we cannot completely get rid of the threat of natural disasters. All of these make the improvement of farmers' lives only steadily and gradually, and it is impossible to "leap to heaven in one step." It is precisely because of these difficult factors that there are still 10 to 15 percent of the rural population whose lives are relatively difficult, of which the most difficult account for 3 to 5 percent. For these people and some of the "five guarantee" households, agricultural cooperatives currently lack sufficient strength to support and provide relief. Our task is to work more deeply, understand them, help them run agricultural cooperatives well, develop production, and improve their lives as much as possible and continuously.

Mistakes and Shortcomings in Leading Agricultural Production Work

In the past few years, we have made some mistakes and shortcomings in leading agricultural production work:

For a period of time, we concentrated our efforts on grasping the increase in grain crop production and neglected to develop diversified operations of agricultural and sideline industries. It is certainly correct to grasp grain production, and it is necessary to continue to work hard in the future, but neglecting to develop diversified operations will inevitably affect the increase in farmers' income and the improvement of their lives. Last year, we began to strengthen our work in this regard and adopted some measures, such as emphasizing the development of diversified operations, appropriately increasing the purchase prices of some agricultural and sideline products, appropriately increasing the members' private plots, and implementing the method of fixed production and purchase of oil materials. The implementation of these measures has begun to show gratifying results. For example, from 1952 to 1955, Hunan's pig production once declined. After adjusting prices and private plots, it quickly rebounded. In 1955, there were only 5.72 million pigs in the province. At the end of 1956, there were 6.08 million, and it is currently estimated that there are more than 7 million. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation, we once seriously grasped the long-term plan for agricultural production, but we did not spare the time to continue to grasp and better integrate the annual production plan of agricultural cooperatives with the long-term plan. The policy of hard work, building the country diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily was not repeatedly publicized to the people's minds. We have also not done enough to clarify some of the misconceptions in the minds of the masses during the great changes in production relations and the great reorganization of the economy. Therefore, in the production of agricultural cooperatives and the lives of members, some phenomena have occurred that only care about income in the current year and do not care about long-term construction; only want to spend more money and enjoy more in the present, and do not pay attention to accumulating funds and expanding reproduction.

We have done a lot of work in popularizing improved varieties and improving technology. In particular, the change to growing double-cropping rice has played a major role in increasing agricultural production. In 1956, double-cropping rice was promoted to 12 million mu throughout the province. This measure alone increased rice production by about 1 billion jin. However, during the socialist upsurge in 1956, we also made relatively serious mistakes. We blindly promoted 230,000 mu of Aomori No. 5, which resulted in reduced production in most areas, with a reduction of more than 40 million jin of rice. We also blindly promoted double-wheel double-plow, which turned out to be unsuitable for paddy fields. Although it did not cause losses in production, it stockpiled funds and alienated the masses. These mistakes were mainly caused by the leadership's bureaucracy and subjectivism. In addition to having reviewed and corrected these mistakes and compensated the masses for their losses, we must also learn a serious lesson from this in future work.

Hunan, like all parts of the country, under the correct leadership of the Party, has not only basically laid the socialist economic foundation through the five major movements and the three major transformations, but also greatly improved the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people, which provides a reliable guarantee for further developing socialist economic and cultural undertakings in the future. At the same time, Hunan has good natural conditions such as terrain, climate, and soil, which are suitable for engaging in a variety of agricultural and sideline production. At present, the potential fertility of paddy fields and dry land in Hunan is still very large, and the average yield per unit area of grain crops can also be greatly increased. The mountains and forests and ponds in Hunan are also poorly utilized. The restoration of oil tea and the promotion of other industrial crops, the development of sideline businesses such as fish farming and raising poultry and livestock all have very favorable conditions. We believe that as long as we thoroughly smash the frenzied attacks of the bourgeois right-wing elements, continue to carry out the rectification movement, reduce and eliminate the shortcomings and errors caused by subjectivism and bureaucracy; make national plans, strengthen leadership, fully utilize favorable conditions, gradually overcome difficulties; further mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, and carry out a wide-ranging, sustained, and diversified agricultural, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, and sideline production movement, we will be able to steadily and continuously improve the living standards of farmers.

### 说“农民生活没有改善”是弥天大谎  周礼的发言

专栏：

    说“农民生活没有改善”是弥天大谎
    周礼的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理和彭副委员长、董院长、张检察长的报告。
    最近一个时期，资产阶级右派分子向党和政府展开了猖狂的进攻。他们蒙着“向党进忠言”的青纱，阴险恶毒地把中国共产党领导中国人民所获得的伟大的成就一笔抹煞，其中之一就是说什么“农民生活没有改善，苦不堪言”。为了粉碎这种毫无根据的诽谤，我想在这里概略介绍一下湖南八年来工农业生产的发展和农民生活改善的情况。这里所引证的材料，主要是湖南省统计局在三十四个县五百一十户中所进行的经常性的农村收支调查，以及我自己先后在八个县视察所获得的材料。这些材料具有一定的代表性，是符合湖南省的实际情况的。
    湖南工农业生产大发展
    解放八年来，湖南省的工农业生产有了很大的发展。从工业方面来看，一九四九年和一九五六年相比，电力由一百零六万度增为四千五百七十一万度，增加四十二点一倍；原煤由十万吨增为二百八十六万吨，增加二十七点六倍；棉纱由一万一千件增为九万五千件，增加七点六三倍；棉布由二百七十二万公尺增为七千五百零四万公尺，增加二十六点五倍。从农业方面来看，一九五六年遭遇了近百年来未有的大旱灾，八百万农业人口和一千一百万亩土地受到程度不同的灾害，但即使以旱情灾情如此严重的一九五六年和一九四九年相比，也可看出农业生产的巨大增长。一九四九年全省粮食产量是一百二十八亿斤，一九五六年增为二百零六亿斤，提高了百分之六十一多。棉花产量由一九四九年的十四万担，增加到一九五六年的三十九万担，提高了百分之一百七十八。生猪由一九四九年的三百五十万头，增加到一九五六年的六百零八万头，提高了百分之七十三，预计今年年底存栏猪将达八百万头。此外，一九五六年茶叶、油菜子、花生、甘蔗、苎麻等作物的产量也都比一九四九年提高了百分之六、七十乃至一倍以上。
    农民的生活显著改善了
    由于土地改革和农业合作化所刺激起来的农业生产的急剧发展，湖南农民的生活状况有了显著的变化，百分之九十以上的农民都程度不同地显著地改善了生活。为了说明这个事实，我们可以从农民的收入、农民的购买力和主要生活资料的消费量、农村阶层的变化以及文化教育事业的发展等方面，提供一些必要的生动的数字。
    占农村总户数87％的家庭过着中农、富裕中农的生活
    首先，我们来看农民收入的增长。一九五六年，平均每一农民全年的纯收入达到八十三元二角，比一九四八年增加了百分之三十，比国民经济已经恢复的一九五二年还增加了百分之十八点一。农民中比较富裕的户，占总农户数的百分之二十五，每人每年的纯收入在九十元以上，相当于过去富裕中农的水平；一般的户占百分之六十二，每人每年的纯收入约七十至八十元，相当于过去普通中农的水平；这就表明，占农村总户数百分之八十七的家庭过着中农和富裕中农的生活。还有百分之十三的户比较困难，每人每年的纯收入五十至六十元，和过去贫农阶层的一般水平差不多。他们中间的大部分人原来就是贫农中最困难的，现在较之解放以前也还是有显著的改善。另外，一部分条件较好、没有遭灾的地方，为数不少的农户每人每年平均收入在一百元以上，也有个别二百元以上的。一部分条件较差、遭灾很重的山区，平均收入就更低一些。例如新化桥头乡桥头社，连续二年受旱，去年秋收的粮食产量减少百分之八十以上，经过努力生产自救和政府救济，平均每人收入仍有三十至四十元，在节约度荒的原则下，能够维持生活，正常的进行生产。
    农村居民购买力五年增长了一倍多
    其次，再看农民的购买力和主要生活资料消费量的增长。一九五○年至一九五五年，全省农村居民的购买力，按每一家庭成员平均计算，由十五元九角增至三十二元八角，增长百分之一百零六。农民对主要生活资料的消费情况，按农民每一家庭成员平均，以一九三六年（历史上消费量最高的一年）和一九五六年（近百年未有的旱灾年）相比，粮食由四百七十六斤增至五百五十六斤，增长百分之十六点八；食油由三斤增至四斤五两，增长百分之四十三点八；肉类由八斤十一两增至九斤六两，增长百分之七点九；食盐由八斤八两增至十三斤三两，增长百分之五十五；棉布由九点三尺增至十六点六尺，增长百分之七十八点四。其中增长幅度最大的为棉布，最小的为肉类。如果与一九四九年相比，增加的比例还要大得多。
    贫农和中农的收入都增加了
    再次，我们来考察一下农村各阶层的变化，因为这种变化标志着农业生产的发展和大多数农民生活的改善。据典型调查，土改时的贫雇农，有百分之八十七的户，现在的经济地位已上升到上中农或下中农的水平。把各阶层一九五六年的平均每人收入和一九三六年（战前最高年）作个比较，则占农村人口绝大多数的贫农、中农都有很大增加，贫农增长百分之四十一，中农增长百分之九点四；而富农则减少百分之十三点六，地主减少百分之四十点八。在中农阶层中，也有个别富裕中农的收入略有减少，这是因为他们过去有轻微剥削的缘故。
    各级学校学生人数增加了几倍
    最后，我们还来看看全省文化教育事业的情况。单以各级学校的学生人数来说，一九五六年小学学生的人数为一九四八年的二倍，为一九五○年的三点三倍；中学生人数为一九四八年的一点七倍，为一九五○年的四倍；大学生为一九四八年的三倍。自清末湖南开始有现代学校起到解放前夕的五十多年间，湖南的中等学校修建的校舍面积只有五十万平方米，而且这些校舍大部分是利用原来祠堂、庙宇、书院、试馆改建的。解放后八年内，新建校舍面积达七十四万平方米，为过去五十年修建的校舍总面积一点四倍。现在，一个农民家里有两三个孩子上中小学已经是很普遍的事，试想，如果农民的生活没有改善，会有这样多的孩子上学吗？
    解放后生活水平下降了的是地主富农
    以上的数字和事实肯定不移地说明：湖南农民的物质和文化生活已经大大改善。这个铁的事实，是任何挖空心思的右派分子无法抹煞的。试问：占总农户百分之八十七的家庭达到中农以上的生活水平，在历史上任何一个朝代能够找到先例吗？右派分子说“农民生活比解放前还苦”，难道不是弥天大谎吗？他们这样攻击共产党，除了别有用心以外，是没有任何理由可以解释得通的。如果说右派分子的论调也有一点真实性的话，那就是占农村人口百分之几的地主、富农和反革命分子。这些人解放后不能再压迫和剥削农民，生活水平确实降低了。至于占农村人口百分之九十以上的农民，特别是贫农和下中农，他们根据自己的切身体验，是清楚地知道谁好谁坏的，他们是一心一意拥护共产党、坚决走社会主义道路的。他们对党和政府也有一些意见，但只是工作上的意见。右派分子想利用这些对工作上的意见，煽动农民和他们一起来反对共产党，反对社会主义，真是白日作梦。
    不可能奇迹似地“一步登天”
    当然，我们还必须清醒地看到：大多数农业社还只有一年多的历史，这一年虽然承受了苦旱的考验，锻炼了社员，减轻了灾情，但要真正把农业社巩固起来，还需要在一段较长的时间内从事十分艰巨的工作；我们的家底单薄，尽管农民生活比解放前有很大改善，但总的来说，农民的生活水平还是不够高的，困难还是不少的；我们的人口增长很快，一九四九年湖南人口为三千万人，八年的时间已增至三千五百万人，平均每年增加百分之二；我们全省的耕地只有五千六百二十五万亩，虽然还有些荒地可以开垦，但仍感耕地面积不足；同时，在目前的条件下，农民生活的改善是不平衡的，也是不十分稳定的，因为我们还不能完全摆脱自然灾害的威胁。所有这些，都使农民的生活只能稳步地、逐步地改善，不可能“一步登天”。也正是由于有着这些困难因素，目前还有占农村人口百分之十至十五的人，生活比较困难，其中最困难的占百分之三至五。对于这些人和一部分五保户，农业社在目前还缺乏足够的力量来支持和救济。我们的任务是：更加深入工作，了解他们，帮助他们办好农业合作社，发展生产，尽可能地、不断地改善生活。
    领导农业生产工作中的错误和缺点
    几年来，我们在领导农业生产的工作中，曾经发生了一些错误和缺点：
    有一个时期，我们集中力量抓紧了粮食作物的增产，忽视了开展农副业的多种经营。抓紧粮食生产，这当然是正确的，也是今后必须继续努力的，但忽视开展多种经营，就必然会影响农民收入的增加和生活的改善。去年我们开始加强了这方面的工作，采取了一些措施，如强调开展多种经营，酌情地提高了一部分农副产品的收购价格，适当增加社员自留地，实行油料定产定购办法等。贯彻执行这些措施，已经开始显示出可喜的成果。如一九五二年到一九五五年，湖南的生猪产量曾一度下降，在调整价格和自留地以后，就迅速回升。一九五五年全省只有五百七十二万头生猪，一九五六年底达到六百零八万头，目前估计已有七百余万头。在农业合作化的高潮中，我们曾经认真地抓了一下农业生产的远景规划，但是没有匀出手来继续抓紧，更好的把农业社的年度生产计划和远景规划结合起来；艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家的方针，没有深入人心地予以反复宣传；对于澄清在生产关系大变革、经济大改组中群众思想上所产生的一些错觉，我们也还作得不够。因此，在农业社的生产方面和社员的生活方面，发生了一些只顾当年收入，不顾长远建设；只图眼前多花钱，多享受，不注意积累资金、扩大再生产的现象。
    在推广良种和改进技术方面，我们作了不少的工作。特别是改种双季稻，对于农业增产起了重大作用。一九五六年，全省双季稻已推广到一千二百万亩，单这一项措施，大约增产十亿斤稻谷。但是，在一九五六年的社会主义高潮中，我们也犯了比较严重的错误。我们盲目地推广了二十三万亩青森五号，结果大部分减产，大约少收稻谷四千多万斤。我们也曾盲目推广双轮双铧犁，结果在水田中不适用，虽然没有在生产上造成损失，但是积压了资金，脱离了群众。这些错误主要是领导上的官僚主义主观主义造成的。对此，除了已经检讨改正并向群众赔偿损失外，还必须在今后的工作中吸取这一严重的教训。
    湖南同全国各地一样，在党的正确领导下，经过五大运动和三大改造，不仅社会主义的经济基础已经基本奠定，而且广大人民的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，这就使今后进一步发展社会主义经济文化事业有了可靠的保证。同时，湖南的地形、气候、土壤等自然条件良好，适宜于从事多种多样的农副业的生产。目前湖南水田、旱土的潜在地力还很大，粮食作物的平均单位面积产量也还可以大大提高。湖南的山林，池塘也利用得很差，油茶垦复和其他技术作物的推广，养鱼、饲养家禽牲畜等副业的发展，都有着十分有利的条件。我们认为只要在彻底粉碎资产阶级右派分子猖狂进攻的同时，继续开展整风运动，减少和消灭由主观主义、官僚主义所造成的缺点和错误；全国规划，加强领导，充分利用有利条件，逐步克服困难；进一步地调动广大农民的积极性，开展广泛持久的、内容多样化的农、林、鱼、牧副业生产运动，我们就能够把农民的生活水平稳妥地、不断地提高。
