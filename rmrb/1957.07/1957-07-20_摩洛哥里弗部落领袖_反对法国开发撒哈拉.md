Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 19th: Prince Khattabi, leader of the Rif tribe of Morocco, attacked yesterday the French plan to develop the Sahara Desert. He believes that these plans are new tricks by the imperialists to steal the riches of the Sahara and extend their military occupation of North Africa.

Prince Khattabi warned France that the people of North Africa will destroy all facilities built for this purpose. He also warned Western countries not to participate financially in this plan, saying that doing so would only arouse the hatred of the people of North Africa.

It is reported that France will begin developing the Sahara Desert in September this year.

    摩洛哥里弗部落领袖
    反对法国开发撒哈拉
    新华社开罗19日电  摩洛哥里弗族部落领袖哈塔比亲王，昨天在这里攻击法国开发撒哈拉大沙漠的计划，他认为这些计划是帝国主义企图窃取撒哈拉的富源，延长它对北非的军事占领的新的诡计。
    哈塔比亲王警告法国说，北非人民将摧毁为了这个目的而建立起来的所有设施。他还警告西方国家不要在财政上参加这个计划，他说，这样做的结果只会引起北非人民的仇恨。
    据报道，法国将在今年9月间着手开发撒哈拉大沙漠。
