Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 9th. Recently, a tenacious struggle against flooding has unfolded in the rural areas of the Yangtze River Delta. In the Suzhou, Songjiang, and Jiaxing regions, more than 600,000 agricultural cooperative members are using 200,000 waterwheels, ox carts, and windmills every day to drain water and protect seedlings day and night. In addition, more than 4,000 pumps are also being used non-stop to remove standing water from the fields. As of July 8th, more than one million mu of waterlogged fields have been drained, and the water level has been reduced in many other waterlogged fields. Agricultural cooperative members in the Songjiang region also rushed to repair more than 3,000 embankments and over 10,000 breaches, greatly reducing the extent of waterlogging.

Since the end of June, the Yangtze River Delta has experienced continuous rainfall, with general areas receiving more than 250 millimeters of rain in about ten days. Yixing County experienced 520 millimeters of rainfall in three and a half days, which is rare in nearly a century. As a result, the water levels of rivers and lakes have risen sharply, and many areas have been waterlogged. According to statistics from the flood control headquarters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the area of waterlogged rice fields in the Yangtze River Delta has reached 5.75 million mu.

Currently, most of the early rice in the Yangtze River Delta is flowering and heading, and the late rice is also tillering and developing. Waterlogging has a significant impact on the growth of rice. Leading cadres of the Party and government in the Suzhou, Songjiang, and Jiaxing regions and counties mostly went to the front lines of drainage and seedling protection in person, and thousands of government cadres also went to the countryside day and night to bail out water and drain water with the peasants. Relevant departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces quickly allocated a large number of drainage equipment, materials, and funds. Huo Shilian, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and responsible cadres of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, Agriculture Department, Civil Affairs Department, and Commerce Department all went deep into the flood-stricken areas to help with the work.

The farmers' drainage struggle in the Yangtze River Delta has also received support from workers, soldiers, students, and residents in cities and towns. Many workers in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Huzhou and other cities have gone to the countryside with pumps and other drainage tools to participate in drainage. Many medical workers, handicraft workers, and supply and marketing cooperative staff in cities and towns have also gone to the countryside one after another to serve the farmers.

At present, the water levels of rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Delta have fallen across the board. If the weather clears up, most of the standing water in the waterlogged fields can be drained within ten days.

    长江三角洲受涝稻田五百多万亩
    农民顽强斗争日夜排涝保苗
    新华社杭州9日电　长江三角洲的农村中，最近展开了同雨涝灾害的顽强斗争。苏州、松江、嘉兴等专区每天有六十多万农业社社员，使用二十万部水车、牛车、风车，日夜排涝保苗。另外有四千多台抽水机，也被用来日夜不停地排除田间积水。到8日为止，已经有一百多万亩涝田排除了积水，还有许多涝田的积水减少了。松江专区农业社社员还突击抢修好三千多条围堤和一万多个缺口，使受涝程度大大减轻。
    6月底以来，长江三角洲连日下雨，一般地区在十天左右下了两百五十公厘以上的雨。宜兴县三天半雨量达五百二十公厘，是近百年来所少见的。因此，江、湖水位猛涨，不少地区受涝。据江苏、浙江两省的防汛指挥部统计，长江三角洲受涝稻田达五百七十五万亩。
    目前，长江三角洲早稻大部在扬花吐穗，晚稻也在分蘖发棵，内涝对稻禾生长影响很大。苏州、松江、嘉兴三专区和各县的党、政负责干部大多亲临排涝保苗的前线，几千名机关干部也日夜下乡，和农民一道戽水排涝。江苏、浙江两省有关部门迅速调拨下大批排涝用的器材、物资、经费。中共浙江省委书记霍士廉和省水利厅、农业厅、民政厅、商业厅的负责干部都深入涝区，帮助工作。
    长江三角洲农民的排涝斗争，还得到了城、镇工人、部队、学生、居民的支援。上海、杭州、苏州、湖州等城市都有不少工人带着抽水机等排涝工具下乡，参加排涝。许多城、镇的医务工作人员、手工业工人、供销社营业员等，也先后下乡，为农民服务。
    目前，长江三角洲的江、湖水位已经全面降落，如果天气放晴，十天以内涝田积水大多可以排出。
