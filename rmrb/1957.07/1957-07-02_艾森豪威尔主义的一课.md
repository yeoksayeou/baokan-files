    A Lesson from the Eisenhower Doctrine
    Yuan Xianlu
    On June 28th, the U.S. State Department issued a formal note to eleven Arab countries: Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. The note requested that these countries "contribute" to creating an atmosphere conducive to a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue. "Associated Press" stated that this note "implied a rebuke to the Arab governments for publicly supporting the Algerian rebels." This is truly a typical example of a diplomatic document from the Eisenhower Doctrine.
    The U.S. State Department sent this note to the eleven countries because the ambassadors of these countries to the United States visited Dulles on May 24th, suggesting that the United States participate in an international investigation of French atrocities in Algeria and requesting that the United States cease its aid to France.
    France is carrying out inhumane massacres in Algeria, which has been confirmed even by many French newspapers. A French officer stationed in Algeria once lamented: "In Algeria, conscience has become a luxury!" Recently, French colonists have also organized several massacres of peaceful residents, attempting to blame them on the Algerian national liberation movement. According to the grandly declared aims of the Eisenhower Doctrine, the U.S. government should be very willing to accept the invitation to participate in an investigation of these atrocities in order to contribute to stopping them and promoting a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue. However, although the U.S. State Department verbally stated its condemnation of all atrocities, it refused to participate in the investigation. The reason given was: "It is doubtful whether such an investigation would promote the cause of a fair settlement of the conflict at an early date." Only from the perspective of protecting colonialism could such a reason be conceived to reject the just proposal of the Arab countries.
    As for France's colonial war in Algeria, it is well known that it relies on weapons and aid supplied by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty. If the United States were to stop this aid to France, it would undoubtedly make a real contribution to ending this bloody war at an early date. However, the U.S. State Department stated unequivocally in the note that military aid to France cannot be stopped. This is because it is said that "not giving France this aid would be inconsistent with the policies of the U.S. government or the interests of the free world." From here, people can gain a concrete understanding of what the "interests of the free world" are in the mouth of the United States and the purpose of the U.S. aid policy.
    The U.S. State Department refused to do anything detrimental to colonialism, and instead turned around and bit the Arab countries, demanding that they "make contributions." This malicious tactic may appease the French colonialists whom the United States is trying to woo, but for the Arab countries and the Algerian people, it is a lesson. When announcing the Eisenhower Doctrine, the United States had specially dressed itself up as a friend of the Arab people, applying much makeup to hide its true face. This note from the U.S. State Department helps the Arab countries to see the true face of this "friend."

    艾森豪威尔主义的一课
    袁先禄
    6月28日，美国国务院给埃及、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、突尼斯和也门这十一个阿拉伯国家一项正式照会。照会里要求这些国家对造成有利于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的气氛“作出贡献”。“美联社”说，这个照会“带有斥责阿拉伯国家政府公开支持阿尔及利亚叛乱分子的含意”。这真是艾森豪威尔主义的外交文件的一个典型的范本。
    美国国务院向十一国发出这份照会，是因为这些国家的驻美国大使在5月24日访问了杜勒斯，建议美国参加对法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行进行的国际调查，并且要求美国停止对法国的援助。
    法国在阿尔及利亚进行着灭绝人性的屠杀，这是连很多法国的报刊也都证实了的。法国在阿尔及利亚驻军中的一个军官曾经这样感叹地说：“在阿尔及利亚，良心已经成为一种奢侈品！”最近，法国殖民者还组织了对于和平居民的几次集体屠杀，而在事后力图嫁罪于阿尔及利亚民族解放运动。按照艾森豪威尔主义所宣布的冠冕堂皇的宗旨，美国政府应当非常乐于接受参加对这种暴行进行调查的邀请，以便对制止这种暴行、促进阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决作出贡献。但是，美国国务院虽然空口说要谴责一切暴行，却拒绝参加调查。理由是：“这种调查是否会促进使冲突早日得到公平解决的事业是值得怀疑的”。只有从袒护殖民主义的角度才能够想出这样一条理由来拒绝阿拉伯国家的正义的建议。
    至于法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，靠了美国通过北大西洋公约供给的武器和援助，这也是人所共知的事情。美国如果停止对法国的这种援助，无疑会对早日结束这场血腥的战争作出真正的贡献。但是，美国国务院在照会里毫不含糊地说：对法国的军事援助是不能停止的。因为据说“不给法国这种援助会是不符合美国政府的政策或自由世界的利益的”。从这里，人们倒是对于美国口中的“自由世界的利益”是什么和美国援助政策的目的得到一个具体的概念。
    美国国务院拒绝作任何不利于殖民主义的事情，反过来还咬阿拉伯国家一口，要它们“作出贡献”。这种恶毒的手法是会使得美国正要拉拢的法国殖民者窝心的，但是对于阿拉伯国家和阿尔及利亚人民来说，却是上了一课。在宣布艾森豪威尔主义的时候，美国曾经涂脂抹粉地特别把自己装扮成阿拉伯人民的朋友。美国国务院的这份照会，有助于阿拉伯国家看清这位“朋友”的真面目。
