Xinhua News Agency, Manila: The United States, in a note delivered to the Philippines on the 19th, refused to return two law-breaking American servicemen to Philippine courts for trial.

As previously reported, Philippine authorities requested that George Roe, a US sailor who injured a Filipino in a car accident last year, be returned to the Philippines for trial. In addition, Philippine authorities also requested the return of Roy Cook, another US serviceman who injured a Filipino in a car accident.

According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on the 22nd, this trial issue has caused increasing anger in the Philippines. The Philippine Foreign Ministry has decided to consult with President Garcia and Philippine judicial officials to draft a diplomatic note requesting the resumption of negotiations on the signing of an extradition treaty.

Negotiations between the United States and the Philippines on the signing of an extradition treaty stalled in 1948. The negotiations were deadlocked mainly because the US authorities refused to extradite wartime US guerrilla personnel accused of murder and rape to Philippine courts for trial. The United States used the pretext of the absence of an extradition treaty between the US and the Philippines when refusing to hand over American criminals George Roe and Roy Cook, who injured Filipinos in car accidents, to Philippine courts for trial. Today, another American serviceman was arrested in Manila for causing a car accident. The vehicle driven by this American serviceman collided with another vehicle.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Cavite, where George Roe committed his crime, has ordered the police to strictly handle the arrest of American servicemen who violate the law. The mayor's order requires that Philippine police detain law-breaking US naval personnel in the future unless a receipt is obtained from the local US naval authorities and they agree to hand over the bailed person to the Philippine court for trial.

### 美国庇护在菲犯罪军人  菲律宾当局愤而筹谋对策

    美国庇护在菲犯罪军人
    菲律宾当局愤而筹谋对策
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：美国19日在交给菲律宾的一项照会中拒绝把两个犯法的美国军人交回菲律宾法庭审讯。
    前已报道，菲律宾当局要求把一个在去年驾车撞伤一个菲律宾人的美国水兵乔治·罗送回菲律宾受审。此外，菲律宾当局还要求把另一个驾车失事伤害菲律宾人的美国军人罗伊·库克送回菲律宾。
    据“马尼拉纪事报”22日报道，受审这件事已经在菲律宾引起了日益增长的愤怒。菲律宾外交部已经决定同加西亚总统和菲律宾司法官员进行商谈，来起草关于要求恢复签订引渡条约谈判的外交照会。
    美菲之间关于签订引渡条约的谈判是于1948年停顿的。谈判陷于僵局主要是因为美国当局拒绝把那些被控告犯有谋杀和强奸罪行的战时美国游击队人员引渡给菲律宾法庭审理。美国这次拒绝把驾车伤害菲律宾人的美国罪犯乔治·罗和罗伊·库克交给菲律宾法庭审判，就曾经以美菲之间没有引渡条约为借口。今天，又有一个美国军人在马尼拉因驾车闯祸被捕。这个美国军人所驾驶的车冲撞了另一辆车。
    同时，乔治·罗犯罪所在地甲米地的市长已经命令警察严格处理拘捕违法的美国军人的事情。这个市长的命令要求，将来如果不得到当地美国海军当局发给收条并且同意以后把保释的人交给菲律宾法庭审判，菲律宾警察就要把犯法的美国海军人员拘留起来。
