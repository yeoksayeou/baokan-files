    Last year, several provinces in our country suffered severe floods, which brought many difficulties to the country and the people. Can we avoid water disasters this year? This is something many people are concerned about.
    After the start of the flood season this year, the Beijiang, Dongjiang, and Xijiang rivers in the Pearl River system have already experienced several major flood peaks, with the Beijiang and Dongjiang rivers exceeding the level three guaranteed water level. Although the water situation in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River is stable and the water level is low, according to the Meteorological Observatory's observations, there is still a possibility of concentrated rainfall in a short period of time this year, causing floods and waterlogging. Judging from the situation in the past six months, this year's rainfall is not evenly distributed. July and August will be the decisive months. Last year, the North China region experienced thirteen consecutive days of heavy rain from July 29th to August 10th, causing a major flood unseen in decades. Last year, the Huai River basin experienced ten consecutive days of rainfall from June 2nd to 11th, causing huge waterlogging disasters. Therefore, it is very dangerous for some people to be blindly optimistic because of the current lack of rain and low water levels.
    Because the status of a backward agricultural country has not been completely changed, the abundance or scarcity of agricultural harvests has a particularly close relationship with all aspects of our country's undertakings. Whether agriculture can have a bumper harvest largely depends on the struggle against natural disasters. At the time of the flood season, it particularly depends on the struggle against flooding. In this regard, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, we have achieved great victories in many extremely difficult struggles over the past few years, creating miracles never seen in history. In this year's flood control struggle in Guangdong, the leadership of the Party has again demonstrated a great role that no one can deny. From mid-May to early June, the Dongjiang River experienced four flood peaks. The fourth flood peak on June 7th exceeded the highest water level since liberation in the middle and lower reaches. During this period, the Party and government organs and leading cadres of the Huiyang Special District, including four commissioners, county magistrates, and county party committee secretaries and members, mostly led the broad masses (including the garrison troops) to fight the floods, persisting for more than half a month, defending sixty or seventy large and medium-sized dikes and nearly one million mu of farmland, keeping them safe and sound; at the same time, they organized the vast number of farmers to drain the accumulated water inside the enclosure, rescue the submerged crops, and engage in production for self-help; and organized the supply of grain and other living materials. When the bottom of a culvert on the last defense line of the Han River dike in Danjiayuan area of Chenghai County was also broken by the flood, and the dike and the people on the dike were in imminent danger, Comrade Yu Xiqu, Commissioner of the Shantou District, rushed over regardless of everything, and dived into the two- or three-zhang-deep flood with the farmers to drive fir piles and fill sandbags, putting his personal life and death completely out of consideration. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, many people did not close their eyes for two days and two nights, so that the dike passed the most critical moment.
    Obviously, with the leadership of the Party, we have ample possibilities to overcome floods and waterlogging. Everyone should have full confidence in this. What work should we do in order to overcome possible floods? To sum up, there are three aspects, namely, the ideological aspect, the organizational aspect, and the material aspect.
    From the ideological point of view, the most important mass ideological problem at present is the thinking of simply relying on the government. The government has invested a lot of money in repairing dikes and building dams in recent years, and has made great achievements, which shows that our government is trustworthy and can be relied upon. However, in many places, because of the lack of ideological education for the masses, some masses think that everything is planned by the government, and the government will not let the people drown or starve to death, so why be anxious, and other passive waiting emotions. Some masses think that everything is going well because there are dikes, or they have been strengthened and heightened, and there is no need to actively prepare for flood control. These harmful ideological emotions must be seriously reversed, so that the masses think from the bad side and break the mentality of luck. This particularly requires education with facts. For example, when Hubei Province inspected the Jingjiang Dike after its renovation, it found hidden dangers in many places. Hunan Province also found dangerous situations and hidden dangers in some dikes in Xiangyin, Yuanjiang and other places. In Hebei Province, because the irrigation culvert was not properly blocked, the flow rate of the Fuyang River only reached forty cubic meters per second from June 13th to 14th, which caused breaches in Pingxiang and Renxian counties, flooding 8,000 mu of land. According to the cone penetration results of the flood control dike in the lower reaches of the Jinjiang River in Fujian Province, the hidden dangers in the dike body are quite serious, and the dikes that should be renovated have not been renovated, and many cracks and rain gullies have been found in the dike body. The above phenomena may also exist in other regions, so the phenomenon of paralysis must be overcome.
    From the organizational point of view, first of all, it is necessary to arrange both flood control and production, and neither neglect flood control due to production, nor neglect production due to flood control. This requires the labor force to be allocated and organized in advance, and to mobilize the masses according to different water conditions. For example, Qingxian County, Hebei Province, last year divided the water conditions into general floods, tense floods, and extra-large floods, and organized the masses into three teams: backbone teams, rescue teams, and reserve teams. Except for extra-large floods, they did not all go to the dike, which avoided the phenomenon of idling on the dike and delaying production. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the labor remuneration for production and flood control should be reasonable and balanced, and should not be too disparate, otherwise, the phenomenon of everyone rushing to go to the dike or no one willing to go to the dike will occur.
    Secondly, we should strive for balanced work attendance and reasonable burden of each agricultural cooperative. Agricultural cooperatives close to the dike may have to work more, and they must be given appropriate remuneration and compensation; but they cannot allow cooperatives far from the dike to make up too much, so as not to affect their lives. This requires the leadership to carry out very careful and responsible organizational work, and there should be no slightest negligence.
    Regarding the issue of equipment and materials, the general spirit is to save as much as possible on the premise of ensuring that the work is done well, and to avoid the serious waste that occurred in last year's flood control. According to this spirit, we should first seriously clean up old flood control equipment and use all useful equipment. Hunan Province cleaned up, proving that there are still many usable old equipment, but there have also been a lot of losses and damages. According to this situation, all regions should conduct an inspection: some things that need to be recovered and can be recovered should be recovered as much as possible. This will be a considerable amount. Secondly, we must rely on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives, fully mobilize the masses, raise flood control equipment, tools, rain gear, and bring their own flood control rations. It should be explained to the masses that in order to save financial expenditures, the government can only provide some of the most necessary support and care now. To truly solve the problem, we must pool our wisdom and efforts, find solutions together, and rely on our own efforts. As long as this principle is seriously explained to the masses, the masses will be able to accept it and understand the government. By doing so, great difficulties can be solved.
    July and August are usually the most tense seasons for flood control. All regions must urgently mobilize and prepare for battle - inspection and repair of hidden dangers and dangerous works of dikes, gates, dams, reservoirs, etc., transportation and preparation of flood control and rescue materials and equipment, migration, rescue, and resettlement of flood diversion and detention areas, organization of grassroots flood control and rescue labor teams, resolution of existing water conservancy disputes, all of these tasks must be done in a timely manner.
    To do these tasks well, all regions should carefully summarize and apply last year's experience. Some past failures should also be paid attention to, so that bad things can be turned into good things. For example, breaches caused by badger holes and rat holes not being discovered, breaches caused by untimely rescue and blocking, breaches caused by improper rescue methods, disasters caused by untimely closing of culvert gates, disasters caused by delayed removal of obstacles in river channels, etc., pay attention to these this year and take appropriate measures to avoid repeating these shortcomings and errors.
    At present, the rainy season has arrived, and heavy rains and floods may occur at any time in various regions. Adapting to this situation, many provinces, special districts, and counties have held flood control meetings, established flood control institutions, and deployed flood control work, achieving many results; but there are also many regions where the upper level is moving but the lower level is not moving, and the deployment has not been made to the townships, and the grassroots flood control organizations have not been established. Some of them have generals but no soldiers, and they are only in form, or the officers and soldiers do not know each other, and the preparation work is progressing slowly, and there are no people or materials on the dike. This phenomenon of paralysis must be changed immediately.
    Doing a good job in flood control preparation work and various tasks during the flood season is one of the most important contents of the movement to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture in the current season. Party and government leading organs in various regions must not relax the organization and leadership of this work because of the rectification campaign.

### 汛期开始以后的紧要工作

    汛期开始以后的紧要工作
    去年我国若干省份遭受了严重的水灾，给国家和人民带来不少的困难。今年我们能不能避免水的灾害呢？这是许多人关心的事情。
    今年汛期开始以后，珠江的北江、东江和西江都已经出现过几次较大的洪峰，北江和东江超过了三级保证水位。长江、黄河和淮河虽然水情平稳，水位较低，但据气象台的观测，今年仍有雨水集中于较短时间、造成洪灾涝灾的可能。从过去半年的情况看，今年的雨水是并不调匀的。7、8两月，将是决定命运的月份。华北地区去年是从7月29日到8月10日连降十三天大雨，造成几十年来未有的大水灾。淮河流域去年是从6月2日到11日连续十天降雨，就造成巨大的涝灾。因此，有一些人因为眼下雨少水小而盲目乐观，是非常危险的。
    由于落后农业国的现状还没有完全改变，所以农业收成的丰歉对于我们国家的各方面事业有着特别密切的关系。而农业是否能够丰收，又在很大程度上决定于对自然灾害的斗争。在汛期到来的时候，就特别决定于防汛的斗争。在这一方面，由于有共产党的领导，几年来我们在许多次极其艰巨的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利，创造过历史上未曾有过的奇迹。今年广东方面的防洪斗争中，党的领导又显示出任何人不能否认的伟大作用。5月中旬到6月上旬，东江来过四次洪峰。6月7日的第四次洪峰，中下游都超过了解放以后的最高水位。这期间，惠阳专区的党政机关和领导干部，包括四个专员、各县县长和县委书记、委员们，大部分都在领导广大群众（驻军也参加了）和洪水搏斗，坚持半个多月，捍卫着六、七十条大、中堤围和近百万亩农田，使之安然无恙；同时组织广大农民排除围内积水，抢救受浸的农作物，生产自救；组织粮食和其他生活资料的供应。澄海县蛋家园一带的韩江堤的最后防线上一个涵洞底部也被洪水冲破，堤防和堤上人群处于千钧一发的紧急关头的时候，汕头区专员余锡渠同志不顾一切地赶来，和农民一起潜入两三丈深的洪水里打杉桩，填沙包，他把个人的生死完全置之度外。在党和政府的领导下，许多人两天两夜没有合眼，使堤围度过了最危急的时刻。
    很明显，有了党的领导，我们就有战胜洪灾涝灾的充分可能。对于这一点，每一个人都应当有充分的信心。为了战胜可能发生的水灾，我们应该做些什么工作呢？归纳起来，有三个方面，这就是思想方面、组织方面和器材物资方面。
    从思想方面说，目前最重要的一种群众性的思想问题，就是单纯依赖政府的思想。政府几年来投了许多资来修堤筑坝，做出了巨大的成绩，说明我们的政府是值得信任的，可以依靠的。但是有许多地方因为对群众缺少思想教育，结果就使得有些群众认为一切事情自有政府筹划，政府不会叫人民淹死饿死，何必着急之类的被动等待情绪。还有一些群众是因为有了堤坝，或者已经加固加高，就以为万事大吉，不再需要积极准备防汛。这些有害的思想情绪，必须认真扭转，使群众从坏处着想，打破侥幸心理。这特别需要用事实来教育。比如湖北省对培修以后的荆江大堤进行检查的时候，发现不少地方都有隐患。湖南省湘阴、沅江等地也发现若干堤防有险情和隐患。河北省滏阳河由于浇地涵洞没有堵好，以致6月13日至14日河内流量只四十秒公方就引起了平乡任县两处的决口，淹地八千亩。福建省晋江下游防洪堤，根据晋江县锥探结果，堤身隐患颇为严重，应当翻修的尚未翻修，并且发现堤身龟裂和雨淋沟很多。以上这些现象，其他地区也可能有，因此必须克服麻痹现象。
    从组织方面说，首先是必须把防汛和生产两方面都安排好，不能因生产而误了防汛，或者因防汛而误了生产。这里要求把劳动力事先分配好，组织好，按不同水情调集群众队伍，如河北青县去年分别一般洪水、紧张洪水、特大洪水等几种水情，把群众组成基干队、抢险队、后备队等三种队伍，非特大洪水，不全体上堤，结果避免了堤上窝工和耽误生产的现象。这是一方面。另一方面，生产和防汛的劳动报酬要合理，平衡，不能悬殊，不然就会发生人人抢着上堤或者谁也不愿上堤的现象。
    其次，是力求各农业社出工平衡，负担合理。离堤近的农业社可能要出工多些，必须使他们得到适当的报酬和补偿；但也不能让离堤远的社找补太多，以免影响他们的生活。这就要求领导上进行很细致很负责的组织工作，不能有丝毫疏忽。
    关于器材物资的问题，总的精神是要在保证做好工作的前提下尽量节约，尽量避免去年防汛中发生的严重浪费现象。根据这种精神，首先应当认真清理旧的防汛器材，把一切有用的器材都利用起来。湖南省清理了一下，证明可用的旧器材还很多，但也已经有不少的丢失和损坏。根据这种情况，各地都应该来一次检查：有些需要追回、可能追回的东西，尽量追回。这将是一个不小的数目。其次，要依靠农业社的集体力量，充分发动群众，自筹防汛器材、工具、雨具，自带防汛口粮。应当向群众说明，政府为了节约财政开支，现在只能给一些最必要的支援和照顾。要真正解决问题，必须群策群力，大家想办法，自力更生。这种道理只要认真给群众讲清楚，群众是能够接受的，对政府是能够谅解的。这样做了，就可以解决很大的困难。
    7、8月通常是防汛最紧张的季节，各地必须紧急动员起来，作好战斗的准备——堤防、闸坝、水库等的隐患和险工的检查和修整，防汛抢险的物料器材的运输准备，分洪、滞洪区的迁移、救护和安置工作，基层防汛抢险民工队伍的组织，尚存的水利纠纷的解决，所有这些工作都必须及时做好。
    为做好这些工作，各地应当很好地总结和运用去年的经验。过去的某些失败的经验，同样应当引起注意，使坏事变成好事。比如因獾穴鼠洞未被发现而造成决口，因抢堵不及时而造成决口，因抢险方法不当而造成决口，因涵洞闸门关闭不及时而致倒漾成灾，因河道障碍物拆除迟缓而致漫溢成灾，等等，今年注意起来，采取适当措施，就可以避免这种缺点错误的重复。
    目前雨季已经来临，各地随时都有可能大降暴雨，发生水患。适应这种情况，很多省、专区和县都召开了防汛会议，成立了防汛机构，布置了防汛工作，取得不少成绩；但是也还有不少地区上动下不动，还没有布置到乡，基层防汛组织还没有建立，有的是有将无兵，流于形式，或官兵互不相识，准备工作进展迟缓，堤上无人也无料。这种麻痹现象必须立即改变。
    做好防汛准备工作和汛期中的各项工作，是争取农业大丰收运动在目前季节的最主要内容之一。各地党政领导机关必须不要因为整风而放松了对这一工作的组织和领导。
