　　On "Deceiving, Intimidating, Swindling, Cheating, Abandoning"
　　Xie Guozhen
　　The Kuomintang secret agents often treated the people with "deceiving, intimidating, swindling, cheating, abandoning." The right-wing elements' attack on the Communist Party is no less than the methods of secret agents. Look, only allowing the finding of shortcomings and not allowing the mention of achievements is beautified as "helping the Communist Party rectify its work style," that's "deceiving"! Writing anonymous threatening letters, threatening to use "bombing" methods if the Party committee doesn't withdraw from the school, claiming to "kill communists," that's "intimidating"! Insisting that Chairman Mao still doesn't know about the school's Party committee system, falsely reporting that Fudan University's Party committee has been abolished, that's "swindling"! Conspiring to oppose the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Marxism-Leninism in their hearts, but verbally saying they support these things, that's "cheating"! Can deceiving, intimidating, swindling, and cheating cover the eyes and ears of the people? No! The people have seen through the right-wing's sinful conspiracies, and the people have risen to fight back. Seeing that the situation is not right, and that deceiving, intimidating, and swindling are not working, the right-wing elements resort to a fake retreat, that's "abandoning"! Some pretend to be making self-criticisms, some boast about their progress, and some even light fires and then deny responsibility. All these are forms of "abandoning"! There are two kinds of abandoning: one is genuine abandoning, abandoning the butcher's knife of anti-communism and anti-people, abandoning the ambition to seize leadership, achieving complete enlightenment, surrendering to the people and pleading guilty, and correcting their evil ways from now on; the other is fake abandoning, which is when they are unable to resist under the people's counterattack and have no choice but to "roll and fight" like Hu Feng, outwardly abandoning but secretly sharpening their swords, observing the direction, and waiting for an opportunity to pounce back. Therefore, our task is to analyze whether the right-wing elements are genuinely or falsely abandoning. Genuine abandoning is good, but we must never be deceived by their fake abandoning, thereby relaxing our fighting spirit.

    谈“哄、吓、诈、骗、丢”
    谢国珍
    国民党特务对待人民常常是“哄、吓、诈、骗、丢”。右派分子进攻共产党呢，可也不逊于特务的手法。你看，只准找缺点，不准讲成绩，美其名曰“帮助共产党整风”，“哄”也！写匿名信威胁，党委不退出学校就用“轰”的办法，声称“杀共产党人”，“吓”也！硬说学校党委制毛主席至今还不知道，假报道复旦大学党委撤销了，“诈”也！骨子里阴谋反共、反社会主义，反马列主义，口头上却说拥护这些，“骗”也！哄吓诈骗能遮住人民的耳目吗？不能！人民看穿右派的罪恶阴谋了，人民起来反击了。右派见势头不对，哄吓诈骗都不成，就来个假退让，“丢也”！他们假装检讨者有之，硬吹进步者有之，乃至伸手放火，缩手不认者亦有之。凡此种种，皆“丢”的形式也！丢有二种：一种是真丢，丢掉反共反人民之屠刀，丢掉夺取领导权之野心，大彻大悟，向人民投降请罪，从此改邪归正；另一种是假丢，那是在人民反击之下，无法抵抗，只好胡风式的“且打滚且作战”，表面上是丢，暗地里还在磨剑窥测方向，待机反扑过来。因此，我们的任务是要分析右派真丢假丢。真丢是好的，但绝不能为其假丢所迷惑，因而松懈斗志。
