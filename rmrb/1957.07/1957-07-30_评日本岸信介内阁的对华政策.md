The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet of Japan carried out a large-scale reorganization on the 10th of this month in order to implement the U.S.-Japan Joint Communiqu√©. Before and after the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke made a series of unfriendly remarks towards our country. These remarks fully exposed Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's features of violating the interests of the Japanese nation, being hostile to the Chinese people, and following the U.S. policy of aggression. Today's talk by Premier Zhou Enlai to Japanese reporters, published in this newspaper, refutes these remarks by Kishi Nobusuke and fully expresses the will of the Chinese people.

Since the changes in Japan's situation after World War II, the Chinese people have always expressed their willingness to be friendly with Japan. The Chinese people express deep sympathy for Japan's current state of being under semi-occupation by the United States. Within the scope of possibility, the Chinese people have continuously taken measures to improve relations with Japan in order to promote the early normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. We believe that doing so is not only beneficial to the people of China and Japan, but also beneficial to the cause of unity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

Our country and Japan have no diplomatic relations to date, and the state of war has not ended. However, on the issue of overseas Chinese, in order to take care of the Japanese nationals in China and their families in Japan, the Chinese people have taken a positive attitude in assisting Japanese nationals who are willing to return to Japan. So far, more than 29,000 of the approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals residing in our country have returned to Japan. On the issue of war criminals, our government dealt with it in a spirit of leniency. On the issues of fisheries and trade, which are closely related to Japan's interests, the Chinese people have also made reasonable solutions at the request of Japan and signed agreements. We are also considering signing long-term trade agreements with relevant parties in Japan to supply Japan with certain industrial raw materials.

However, after the Chinese people took these measures, the Japanese government did not take corresponding measures to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan, or to promote the early realization of the normalization of relations between the two countries. On the contrary, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke not only obstructed the signing of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, the mutual establishment of trade delegations between the two countries, the holding of Chinese commodity exhibitions in Japan, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese payment agreement, but also made a false countercharge on the issue of Japanese nationals, fabricating the so-called "35,767 missing" Japanese, attempting to write off the efforts made by our government and the Red Cross Society of our country over the years to assist Japanese nationals in returning to Japan according to their own wishes. At the same time, on the issue of embargoes, when the Japanese people demanded to completely get rid of the restrictions of embargoes, and some Western countries also demanded to get rid of the restrictions on our country, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet adopted a so-called conciliatory and compromise attitude, attempting to continue to maintain U.S. interests, and in essence, continuing the embargo policy.

Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's hostile behavior towards our country is by no means limited to this.

Before Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke visited the United States, in order to please the United States and increase his capital when begging for aid from the United States, he made a special trip to Taiwan and spread slanderous remarks against our people in Taiwan. According to a report by the Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Taipei, Kishi Nobusuke said when meeting with Chiang Kai-shek on the afternoon of June 3 that "real cooperation between Japan and Taiwan is necessary for stabilizing Asia and world peace." He also said that "mainland China is now under communist rule," so he believes that "from this point of view, it is even more necessary to deepen cooperation between the two sides in a certain sense." Finally, he even said that "the conservative parties in Japan will never adopt a pro-communist or neutral stance," "In a sense, the penetration of communism into Japan is more terrible from China than from the Soviet Union, so in this sense, if the mainland can be recovered, I think it is very good." (See Asahi Shimbun, June 4 this year) Later, when Kishi Nobusuke went to the United States, he said that "the Chinese Communist regime will eventually collapse." (See AP Denver, June 12)

These are nakedly hostile remarks against the Chinese people. Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's provocation cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people. Kishi Nobusuke is of course clear that Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of our country's territory, and our government has repeatedly declared that it will liberate Taiwan, which is an unswerving national policy unanimously supported by our people. Our territory of Taiwan is controlled and occupied by the United States, and its situation is roughly similar to that of Japan. The people of China and Japan should sympathize with and support each other on the issue of opposing the U.S. occupation of their own territories, but Kishi Nobusuke actually stood on the side of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and even openly advocated that "it is very good to counterattack the mainland," which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. In the spirit of the Five Principles, the Chinese people never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, so we recognize any government elected by the people of that country, regardless of party affiliation. However, the Chinese people can never tolerate such blatant interference in our country's internal affairs and the provocative act of encouraging Taiwan to "counterattack the mainland." Could it be that the core of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's policy toward China is to incite the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to launch a war of "counterattacking the mainland," and even attempt to further re-interfere in Taiwan?!

Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's flattery of the United States and hostility towards our country are nothing more than an attempt to turn Japan into a follower of the U.S. policy of aggression in Asia. When Kishi Nobusuke visited Southeast Asia in late May of this year, he lobbied everywhere and even attempted to provoke relations between Southeast Asian countries and our country, and publicized the "benefits" of "U.S. aid." However, since Southeast Asian countries have already tasted the "benefits" of so-called "U.S. aid," they generally expressed indifference to Kishi Nobusuke's plan to develop Southeast Asia with U.S. funds, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources. At the same time, the relations between Southeast Asian countries and our country have always been friendly, so Kishi Nobusuke's provocative tricks did not have any effect. Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia was actually a complete failure. However, these did not make Kishi Nobusuke learn a lesson. When he visited the United States in June, he again presented this as a suggestion in a pretentious manner. At the same time, in order to obtain concessions from the United States in this regard, he did not hesitate to put forward Japan's active expansion policy to the United States, and took a series of other measures, that is, the establishment of a constitutional investigation committee, the preparation to amend the election law, and the open release of air in the Diet, saying that Japan's possession of atomic weapons does not violate the constitution, preparing to put Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system and revive Japanese militarism.

In contrast to Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's hostile attitude towards our country, the broad masses of the Japanese people, including the Japanese Socialist Party, have adopted a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. The Japanese people have launched a magnificent movement to restore normal relations with China, develop trade and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, and fight for opposition to war, opposition to nuclear weapons testing, and defense of peace. Now the Japanese people are working hard to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. These are all positive factors in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, and are welcomed by the Chinese people.

In recent years, friendly exchanges between the people of China and Japan have become more and more frequent. Many Japanese people's organizations, semi-official representatives, and representatives of various cities have continuously visited China. Many Chinese delegations have also been invited by the Japanese people to visit Japan. Many non-governmental agreements have been reached in these visits, such as the agreements signed between representatives of the two countries' economic, trade, fisheries, culture, trade unions, congressmen, science, and parties, of which there are no fewer than 30 to date, and many agreements have been implemented. These activities have played a great role in enhancing the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Obviously, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke is leading Japan on a dangerous path of hostility towards new China, undermining Sino-Japanese friendly relations, and following the U.S. policy of aggression. This is also the path of isolating Japan from Asian and African countries, which is contrary to the interests of the entire Japanese nation. We believe that only the path of peace, independence, and friendship truly conforms to the interests of the Japanese nation and to the requirements of Asian and world peace.
