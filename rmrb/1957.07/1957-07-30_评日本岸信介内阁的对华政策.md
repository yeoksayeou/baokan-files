The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet of Japan carried out a large-scale reorganization on the 10th of this month in order to implement the U.S.-Japan Joint Communiqué. Before and after the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke made a series of unfriendly remarks towards our country. These remarks fully exposed Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's features of violating the interests of the Japanese nation, being hostile to the Chinese people, and following the U.S. policy of aggression. Today's talk by Premier Zhou Enlai to Japanese reporters, published in this newspaper, refutes these remarks by Kishi Nobusuke and fully expresses the will of the Chinese people.

Since the changes in Japan's situation after World War II, the Chinese people have always expressed their willingness to be friendly with Japan. The Chinese people express deep sympathy for Japan's current state of being under semi-occupation by the United States. Within the scope of possibility, the Chinese people have continuously taken measures to improve relations with Japan in order to promote the early normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. We believe that doing so is not only beneficial to the people of China and Japan, but also beneficial to the cause of unity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

Our country and Japan have no diplomatic relations to date, and the state of war has not ended. However, on the issue of overseas Chinese, in order to take care of the Japanese nationals in China and their families in Japan, the Chinese people have taken a positive attitude in assisting Japanese nationals who are willing to return to Japan. So far, more than 29,000 of the approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals residing in our country have returned to Japan. On the issue of war criminals, our government dealt with it in a spirit of leniency. On the issues of fisheries and trade, which are closely related to Japan's interests, the Chinese people have also made reasonable solutions at the request of Japan and signed agreements. We are also considering signing long-term trade agreements with relevant parties in Japan to supply Japan with certain industrial raw materials.

However, after the Chinese people took these measures, the Japanese government did not take corresponding measures to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Japan, or to promote the early realization of the normalization of relations between the two countries. On the contrary, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke not only obstructed the signing of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, the mutual establishment of trade delegations between the two countries, the holding of Chinese commodity exhibitions in Japan, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese payment agreement, but also made a false countercharge on the issue of Japanese nationals, fabricating the so-called "35,767 missing" Japanese, attempting to write off the efforts made by our government and the Red Cross Society of our country over the years to assist Japanese nationals in returning to Japan according to their own wishes. At the same time, on the issue of embargoes, when the Japanese people demanded to completely get rid of the restrictions of embargoes, and some Western countries also demanded to get rid of the restrictions on our country, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet adopted a so-called conciliatory and compromise attitude, attempting to continue to maintain U.S. interests, and in essence, continuing the embargo policy.

Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's hostile behavior towards our country is by no means limited to this.

Before Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke visited the United States, in order to please the United States and increase his capital when begging for aid from the United States, he made a special trip to Taiwan and spread slanderous remarks against our people in Taiwan. According to a report by the Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Taipei, Kishi Nobusuke said when meeting with Chiang Kai-shek on the afternoon of June 3 that "real cooperation between Japan and Taiwan is necessary for stabilizing Asia and world peace." He also said that "mainland China is now under communist rule," so he believes that "from this point of view, it is even more necessary to deepen cooperation between the two sides in a certain sense." Finally, he even said that "the conservative parties in Japan will never adopt a pro-communist or neutral stance," "In a sense, the penetration of communism into Japan is more terrible from China than from the Soviet Union, so in this sense, if the mainland can be recovered, I think it is very good." (See Asahi Shimbun, June 4 this year) Later, when Kishi Nobusuke went to the United States, he said that "the Chinese Communist regime will eventually collapse." (See AP Denver, June 12)

These are nakedly hostile remarks against the Chinese people. Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's provocation cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people. Kishi Nobusuke is of course clear that Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of our country's territory, and our government has repeatedly declared that it will liberate Taiwan, which is an unswerving national policy unanimously supported by our people. Our territory of Taiwan is controlled and occupied by the United States, and its situation is roughly similar to that of Japan. The people of China and Japan should sympathize with and support each other on the issue of opposing the U.S. occupation of their own territories, but Kishi Nobusuke actually stood on the side of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and even openly advocated that "it is very good to counterattack the mainland," which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. In the spirit of the Five Principles, the Chinese people never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, so we recognize any government elected by the people of that country, regardless of party affiliation. However, the Chinese people can never tolerate such blatant interference in our country's internal affairs and the provocative act of encouraging Taiwan to "counterattack the mainland." Could it be that the core of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's policy toward China is to incite the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to launch a war of "counterattacking the mainland," and even attempt to further re-interfere in Taiwan?!

Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's flattery of the United States and hostility towards our country are nothing more than an attempt to turn Japan into a follower of the U.S. policy of aggression in Asia. When Kishi Nobusuke visited Southeast Asia in late May of this year, he lobbied everywhere and even attempted to provoke relations between Southeast Asian countries and our country, and publicized the "benefits" of "U.S. aid." However, since Southeast Asian countries have already tasted the "benefits" of so-called "U.S. aid," they generally expressed indifference to Kishi Nobusuke's plan to develop Southeast Asia with U.S. funds, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources. At the same time, the relations between Southeast Asian countries and our country have always been friendly, so Kishi Nobusuke's provocative tricks did not have any effect. Kishi Nobusuke's trip to Southeast Asia was actually a complete failure. However, these did not make Kishi Nobusuke learn a lesson. When he visited the United States in June, he again presented this as a suggestion in a pretentious manner. At the same time, in order to obtain concessions from the United States in this regard, he did not hesitate to put forward Japan's active expansion policy to the United States, and took a series of other measures, that is, the establishment of a constitutional investigation committee, the preparation to amend the election law, and the open release of air in the Diet, saying that Japan's possession of atomic weapons does not violate the constitution, preparing to put Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system and revive Japanese militarism.

In contrast to Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's hostile attitude towards our country, the broad masses of the Japanese people, including the Japanese Socialist Party, have adopted a friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. The Japanese people have launched a magnificent movement to restore normal relations with China, develop trade and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, and fight for opposition to war, opposition to nuclear weapons testing, and defense of peace. Now the Japanese people are working hard to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. These are all positive factors in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, and are welcomed by the Chinese people.

In recent years, friendly exchanges between the people of China and Japan have become more and more frequent. Many Japanese people's organizations, semi-official representatives, and representatives of various cities have continuously visited China. Many Chinese delegations have also been invited by the Japanese people to visit Japan. Many non-governmental agreements have been reached in these visits, such as the agreements signed between representatives of the two countries' economic, trade, fisheries, culture, trade unions, congressmen, science, and parties, of which there are no fewer than 30 to date, and many agreements have been implemented. These activities have played a great role in enhancing the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Obviously, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke is leading Japan on a dangerous path of hostility towards new China, undermining Sino-Japanese friendly relations, and following the U.S. policy of aggression. This is also the path of isolating Japan from Asian and African countries, which is contrary to the interests of the entire Japanese nation. We believe that only the path of peace, independence, and friendship truly conforms to the interests of the Japanese nation and to the requirements of Asian and world peace.

### 评日本岸信介内阁的对华政策

    评日本岸信介内阁的对华政策
    本月10日，日本岸信介内阁为了执行美日联合公报，进行了大规模的改组。在内阁改组前后，岸信介首相发表了一连串对我国不友好的言论。这些言论，充分地暴露了岸信介首相违背日本民族利益、敌视中国人民、追随美国侵略政策的面目。今天本报发表的周恩来总理对日本记者的谈话，驳斥了岸信介的这些言论，完全表达了中国人民的意志。
    自从第二次大战后日本的处境发生了变化以来，中国人民一直表示愿意同日本友好。中国人民对于日本今天处于美国半占领的状态，表示深刻的同情。中国人民在可能的范围内，不断地采取了措施，改善同日本的关系，以促进中日关系的早日正常化。我们认为，这样做不仅有利于中日两国人民，而且也是有利于亚非国家的团结和世界和平的事业的。
    我国和日本迄今并没有外交关系，同时也没有结束战争状态。然而在侨民问题上，为了照顾在中国的日侨及其在日本的家属，中国人民还是采取了协助愿意回日本的日侨返回日本的积极态度。到目前为止，居留在我国的三万五千名左右日侨中，已有二万九千多名返回日本。在战犯问题上，我国政府本着宽大精神进行了处理。在和日本利益密切相关的渔业和贸易的问题上，中国人民也应日本的要求，作了合理的解决，并且签订了协议。我们还正在考虑和日本的有关方面签订长期的贸易协议，供应日本需要的某些工业原料。
    可是中国人民在采取了这些措施以后，日本政府并没有采取相应的措施，加强中日间的友好关系，或者促进中日两国关系正常化的早日实现。相反，岸信介首相不仅在中日间第四次贸易协定的签订、两国相互设立通商代表团、在日本举办中国商品展览会、以及签订中日支付协定等问题上进行阻挠，而且还在日本侨民问题上反咬一口，无中生有地提出所谓“三万五千七百六十七名下落不明”的日本人问题，企图一笔抹煞我国政府和我国红十字会几年来协助日本侨民根据其自愿返回日本所作的种种努力。同时，在禁运问题上，当日本人民要求完全摆脱禁运的限制，而西方某些国家也在要求摆脱对我国禁运限制的今天，岸信介内阁却采取了所谓从中调解和折衷的态度，企图继续维护美国利益，实质上是依然继续禁运政策。
    岸信介首相敌视我国的行为，绝不仅止于此。
    当岸信介首相访问美国之前，为了讨好美国，增加向美国乞援时候的资本，特地去台湾跑了一趟，并且在台湾散布了诬蔑我国人民的话。据日本朝日新闻驻台北特派员的报道，岸信介在6月3日下午会见蒋介石时说，日本和台湾的“真正合作，对于稳定亚洲和世界和平是必要的。”他又说，“中国大陆现在处在共产主义的统治之下”，因此他认为“从这点出发，在某种意义上来说，更有必要加深双方的合作。”最后他竟说，“日本的保守政党决不采取容共或者中立的立场”，“在某种意义上，共产主义对日本的渗透，与其说来自苏联还不如说来自中国的更为可怕，因此在这一意义上，如果能收复大陆，我认为是非常好的。”（见今年6月4日朝日新闻）以后岸信介去美国时，又说“中国共产党政权终究要坍台。”（见美联社丹佛6月12日电）
    这是赤裸裸的敌视中国人民的言论。岸信介首相这一挑衅，不能不引起中国人民莫大的愤慨。岸信介当然清楚，台湾一向是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我国政府也早已再三宣告一定要解放台湾，这是我国人民一致拥护的不变的国策。我国领土台湾被美国所控制占领，其处境和日本大致相像。中日两国人民在反对美国占领本国领土的问题上本应相互同情和支持，可是岸信介却竟然站在美国和台湾的蒋介石集团这一边，甚至公开鼓吹“反攻大陆非常好”，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民根据五项原则的精神，绝不干涉别国内政，因此无论属于什么党派，只要是该国人民选举出来的政府，我们都加以承认。但中国人民绝不能容忍这样悍然干涉我国内政、鼓励台湾“反攻大陆”的挑衅行为。难道岸信介首相的对华政策的中心，就是煽起台湾蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”的战争，甚至企图进一步重新染指台湾吗？！
    岸信介首相取媚美国、敌视我国，无非是要把日本变成美国侵略亚洲的追随者的地位。当今年5月下旬岸信介访问东南亚的时候，即到处进行游说甚至企图挑拨东南亚各国和我国的关系，并宣扬“美援”的“好处”。但是由于东南亚各国已经尝过所谓“美援”的“好处”，因此对岸信介的用美国的资金、日本的技术、东南亚的资源开发东南亚的计划，普遍表示冷淡。同时东南亚各国和我国的关系历来是友好的，因此岸信介的挑拨伎俩并没有收到任何效果。岸信介的东南亚之行，实际上是碰了一鼻子灰，是完全失败的。不过这些并没有使岸信介引为教训。当6月中他访问美国的时候，又像煞有介事地把这作为献策提出来。同时为了取得美国在这方面的让步，甚至不惜向美国提出了日本的积极的扩军方针，并且采取了其他的一连串措施，这就是成立宪法调查会，准备修改选举法，以及在国会里公开放出空气，说日本拥有原子武器也不违反宪法，为把日本投入美国的原子战略体系，复活日本军国主义进行准备。
    同岸信介首相的敌视我国的态度相反，日本广大人民，包括日本社会党在内的日本各人民团体，对中国人民采取了友好的态度。日本人民曾展开了同中国恢复正常关系、发展日本和中国的贸易关系和文化交流，以及为反对战争、反对核武器的试验、保卫和平而奋斗的波澜壮阔的运动。现在日本人民正为恢复中日邦交而努力。这些都是促进中日友好的积极因素，是中国人民所欢迎的。
    最近几年来，中日人民间的友好往来已越来越频繁。日本许多人民团体、半官方代表、各城市代表，不断到中国来访问。中国许多代表团，也受到日本人民的邀请，去日本进行了访问。在这些访问中达成了许多民间的协议，如两国的经济、贸易、渔业、文化、工会、议员、科学、党派等方面代表间签订的协议，到现在已不下三十种，并且许多协议已经付诸实施。这些活动对于增进中日人民的友好关系，发生了很大的作用。
    很显然，岸信介首相正在把日本带上敌视新中国、破坏中日友好关系、追随美国侵略政策的危险的道路。这也就是从亚非各国中把日本孤立起来的道路，这是和日本整个民族的利益相违背的。我们认为，只有和平、独立、友好的道路，才是真正符合日本民族利益并且符合亚洲和世界和平的要求的。
