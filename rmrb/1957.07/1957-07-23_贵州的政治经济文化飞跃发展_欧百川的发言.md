I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and all other reports of the conference, and I request the conference to approve and adopt them.

At this meeting, I studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which elevated my thinking. Recalling my time in Guizhou helping the Party with the rectification campaign, some of my statements were incorrect. Due to the influence of my bourgeois individualism and narrow local nationalism, I believed that problems in cooperation between Party members and non-Party individuals were solely caused by the shortcomings of Party member cadres. In ethnic work, I often made excessively high and hasty demands, exaggerating shortcomings and overlooking achievements. This attitude of not proceeding from reality and not considering the overall situation demonstrates that there are still problems with my standpoint and viewpoint. After studying Chairman Mao's report and conducting a preliminary self-examination, I have begun to recognize these errors and must continue to examine and transform my thinking in the future. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the work situation in Guizhou.

**Tremendous Changes in Just a Few Years**

Guizhou is a province with a mixed population of many ethnic groups. Before liberation, it was an extremely poor and backward region. Due to the cruel oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, people of all ethnic groups lived in misery and starvation for a long time. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, land reform was completed. Last year, our province achieved agricultural cooperativization throughout the province, and agricultural production greatly developed. Last year was the first year of realizing cooperativization. Although twelve counties in the province suffered severe drought, thanks to the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, we finally overcame various natural disasters and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain production increasing by 1.1 billion jin, more than 13 percent higher than in 1955. This was the year with the largest increase in production since liberation. As production continued to develop, people's lives greatly improved. Before liberation, Guizhou was a grain-deficient province, requiring grain to be transported from other provinces. This situation changed after the completion of land reform. From 1952 to the end of 1956, our province transported a total of 1.57 billion jin of grain to support national construction. Production in minority areas has also greatly developed. Last year, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy was further promoted. Based on the concentration of various ethnic minorities, two autonomous prefectures, two autonomous counties (adding to the original three autonomous counties), and 114 ethnic townships were established. The unity among ethnic groups was strengthened, greatly boosting the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the people of all ethnic groups. In recent years, the government has actively supported the development of production in minority areas, distributing free agricultural tools, agricultural loans, and various relief grain and funds, enabling the continuous development of production in ethnic areas. Especially after the realization of agricultural cooperativization in minority areas of our province last year, all ethnic autonomous areas have achieved increased production. Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture (including Sandu Autonomous County) increased grain production by 16 percent last year; Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture increased production by more than 7 percent; Weining Autonomous County increased production by 12.5 percent; and Songtao Autonomous County increased production by about 11 percent. Over the past few years, with the continuous development of production, even in the original extremely poor, high-altitude and barren areas, the lives of people of all ethnic groups have greatly improved. According to statistics from eleven counties including Weining in the high-altitude and barren areas, grain production in 1950 was 712 million jin, which increased to 1.234 billion jin in 1956, an increase of 73.3 percent. According to a survey of five counties including Weining, the average purchase of cloth per person in 1952 was 1.23 chi, while in 1956 it was 9.7 chi, an increase of more than seven times; the average purchase of salt per person in 1952 was slightly more than half a jin, while in 1956 it was 3.5 jin, an increase of five times. After only a few years of effort, the poor and backward conditions in minority areas have undergone significant changes. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the tragic life of having no grain to eat, no salt to eat, and no clothes to wear, which many people used to live, has been fundamentally changed. The absurd remarks made by those rightists, who shouted that "cooperatives in minority areas are poorly run" and that "people's lives have not improved," are attempting to provoke the relationship between our ethnic minorities and the Party and the People's Government, to undermine ethnic unity, and to oppose socialism. The iron facts have shattered the rightists' conspiracy. Our cooperatives are run correctly and well, production has developed, and people's lives have greatly improved. Cooperativization has brought happiness to people of all ethnic groups, and they are marching victoriously along the broad road of socialism.

**Pay Attention to the Characteristics of Mountainous Minority Groups**

During the upsurge of the cooperative movement, cooperatives developed rapidly. We did not adequately publicize and educate about ethnic policies. Some minority areas experienced the problem of neglecting ethnic characteristics and not taking sufficient care of ethnic customs. "Private garden land," "flower-picking slopes," "ancestral worship fields," "cotton fields," and "stud oxen" that should not have been included in the cooperatives were included, and the amount of private plots was too small. After a province-wide inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, corrections have been basically made. However, some regions still do not adequately consider the special needs of ethnic minorities for production, such as not including glutinous rice, cotton, hemp, indigo, and other necessities for their lives in the production plan for unified arrangement according to their different customs. Some did not adequately consider ethnic festivals in terms of production time, such as not appropriately reserving time for the Miao "April 8th" festival and the Buyi "Mountain Worship" and "Rice Seedling Worship" festivals when arranging production. In ethnic joint cooperatives, some did not arrange cooperative cadres according to the principle that each ethnic group should have a corresponding proportion, and did not adequately care for ethnic groups with small populations. These shortcomings must continue to be examined and corrected. Some economic departments still have some problems in implementing price policies. The prices of some local specialties and cash crops are too low; some purchase and sales price differences are too large; and sometimes there are phenomena of price suppression at each level, which is not conducive to production and needs to be gradually and appropriately adjusted. In addition, the high-altitude and barren mountainous areas of our province, which are where most ethnic minorities live, although production has greatly developed, due to the barren land and backward cultivation techniques, the yield of crops is still very low, and the development of production and the living standards of the people are still far behind the central areas of our province. In the past, we did not adequately consider the special difficulties of these areas in our work. In order to develop production in these areas, prosper the economy, and gradually change their backward conditions, we must further strengthen leadership, and the government should continue to provide assistance and support. Mobilize the strength of the people of all ethnic groups in these areas to carry out arduous labor, implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and running cooperatives democratically," and further exert the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. On the premise of ensuring increased grain production, actively develop diversified operations and sideline production, such as the ramie of Wangmo, the animal husbandry products of Weining, and the forestry sideline products and local specialties of other minority areas. In this way, we can gradually change the backward conditions of these areas, and the lives of people of all ethnic groups will be further improved with the development of production.

**Development of Transportation, Industry, and Cultural and Educational Undertakings**

Transportation in our province is extremely inconvenient, and developing transportation is an important condition for promoting economic development in mountainous areas. In recent years, our province has built 2,664 kilometers of highways and simple roads, an increase of 74 percent over the total length of highways in the province before liberation. 1,480 kilometers have been built in minority areas, which has greatly improved the transportation conditions in Guizhou and promoted the exchange of materials. Many local specialties have found sales outlets. However, there are still very few highways in Guizhou, and inconvenient transportation is still a great difficulty. There are still some marginal counties that are not accessible by car, making it impossible to transport many local specialties from the marginal areas. We must gradually develop transportation in these areas. In the future, the government should continue to invest in the construction of some highways, and continue to mobilize people of all ethnic groups to build more rural post roads and develop animal power transportation, gradually changing the situation of traffic congestion and promoting the economic development of these areas.

As everyone knows, industry in Guizhou is very backward. Before liberation, there were almost no factories. In the few years since liberation, industry has also greatly developed, and some small processing factories have also been established in minority areas. But industry is still very backward. Guizhou has the conditions to develop industry. The resources on the ground and underground are very abundant, and minority areas also have rich mineral deposits. Forest products, cotton, hemp, wool, leather, etc. are also suitable for developing light industry. In the future, we should further develop local industry and open more small and medium-sized light industries. At the same time, we hope that relevant central departments will arrange some industrial projects in Guizhou in the future to help Guizhou develop industrial construction. In the future, when building new enterprises and expanding enterprises, we should also pay more attention to absorbing some minority people and training minority workers to participate in industrial construction.

Due to the continuous development of production, cultural and educational undertakings in our province have also greatly developed. In 1956, the number of students in primary and secondary schools reached more than 1.5 million, an increase of eight and a half times compared with 1950; among them, the number of minority students reached more than 340,000, an increase of fourteen and a half times compared with 1950. In cultural and educational work, we must further improve the quality of education and strengthen labor education in the future. At the same time, due to the very backward education in our province in the past, the development of schools and the number of students are still less than in advanced areas, and the culture of minority people is even more backward. In the future, we need to continue to develop step by step, appropriately add some schools in the marginal minority areas, and strengthen the training of various professional talents of minority nationalities in a planned way.

**The Great Victory of the Anti-Rightist Campaign**

Due to the firm implementation of the policy of "eliminating counter-revolutionaries wherever they are found and correcting mistakes wherever they are made" and the full mobilization of the masses, the anti-rightist campaign in our province has achieved a great victory. In the process of the anti-rightist struggle, due to the masses' righteous indignation towards counter-revolutionaries, there were struggles against a very small number of people who, although guilty, could have been struggled against or not, and even individual people who should not have been struggled against at all were wrongly struggled against, which is completely understandable. At the same time, corrections were resolutely made as soon as they were discovered. However, in some places where the anti-rightist campaign has ended, there were still cases of missing counter-revolutionaries. According to the inspection by the municipal-level organs of Guiyang, 13 counter-revolutionaries were missed. For example, Zhang Lian'an, a counter-revolutionary in the Guiyang Municipal Grain Bureau, served as a bandit battalion commander after liberation, killing three revolutionary cadres. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1952, he changed his name, fabricated his history, and mixed into the Grain Bureau as a worker, pretending to be active. Later, he was promoted to a cadre. Only after the end of the anti-rightist campaign did the bureau discover his real name. After investigation, it was confirmed that he was a counter-revolutionary with blood debts and popular resentment. He Yuhe, a counter-revolutionary in the Provincial Chemical Company, joined our guerrilla team during the Anti-Japanese War, but later surrendered to the enemy and became a Japanese puppet traitor and secret agent. Because of his betrayal, seven revolutionary cadres and farmers were brutally killed by the Japanese invaders. It was also discovered and investigated only after the end of the anti-rightist campaign. Another example is He Yunshou, a counter-revolutionary in the Provincial Statistics Bureau, who joined the bandits after liberation, spied on military intelligence, robbed grain warehouses, and arbitrarily beat farmers. The masses were extremely resentful. After the end of the anti-rightist struggle, he was wrongly rehabilitated, which caused extreme dissatisfaction among the cadres of the agency and the local people. Finally, he was legally dealt with by the judicial organs. This fully shows that, although counter-revolutionaries have been basically eliminated through the anti-rightist struggle, the fact proves that counter-revolutionaries are very cunning, and there are still missing counter-revolutionaries that have not been completely and thoroughly eliminated. It is recommended that the relevant departments of the central public security and procuratorate pay special attention to this situation. We should continue to maintain high vigilance, continue to implement the policy of "eliminating counter-revolutionaries wherever they are found and correcting mistakes wherever they are made," thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction. During the anti-rightist struggle, some rightists shouted and screamed, saying that "the anti-rightist campaign was done wrong," that "most of them were wrongly struggled against," and even that "more than 90 percent were struggled against wrongly." This is a complete distortion of right and wrong. I want to ask these rightists, why do you not mention a word about the missing counter-revolutionaries? Do you want to keep more counter-revolutionaries? What are your intentions? We, the people of all ethnic groups, will never tolerate your ulterior motives. We must resolutely and completely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and defend our great socialist cause.

**Continue to Advance on the Socialist Road**

In recent years, Guizhou's economy, culture, and education have greatly developed, and all aspects of work have achieved great results. However, due to Guizhou's poor foundation, the level of production is still not high, and the people's lives are still low. We must continue to work hard. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, by strengthening the close unity of the people of all ethnic groups, overcoming shortcomings in our work, and implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, we will surely achieve new and greater development on the existing foundation. Our Guizhou was originally an extremely poor and backward area. In just a few years, it has achieved such great achievements, and the people of all ethnic groups have achieved leapfrog development in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. This can only be done under the leadership of the Communist Party. Our people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly support the Party. I want to warn the rightists that we will never tolerate your conspiracies against the Party and socialism. We and the people of all brotherly ethnic groups resolutely oppose them. We will always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely take the socialist road, and strive to build a great socialist cause.

    贵州的政治经济文化飞跃发展
    欧百川的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告，并请大会予以批准通过。
    这次会议我学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，提高了我的思想。回忆我在贵州帮助党整风的时候，发表的一些言论是有错误的，由于我的资产阶级个人主义思想和狭隘地方民族主义思想的作祟，对于党员干部同党外人士合作中的问题，我认为只是党员干部的毛病造成的；在民族工作上，我常常提出了过高过急的要求，夸大了缺点，抹煞了成绩。这种不从实际出发、不从整体出发的态度，正说明我的立场观点尚有问题。经过学习毛主席的报告及自己初步的思想检查，使我初步认识到这些错误，今后尚须继续检查，改造我的思想。现在，我就贵州的工作情况发表一点意见。
    短短几年间的巨大变化
    贵州是一个多民族杂居的省份，解放前是一个极为贫穷落后的地区，由于反动统治的残酷压迫和剥削，各族人民长期过着饥寒交迫的悲惨生活。解放后，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，完成了土地改革，去年我省又在全省范围内实现了农业合作化，农业生产得到很大发展。去年是实现合作化的第一年，虽然全省有十二县遭受了严重旱灾，由于发挥了农业合作社的优越性，终于战胜了各种自然灾害，获得了空前未有的丰收，粮食增产十一亿斤，较一九五五年增产百分之十三以上，这是解放后增产幅度最大的一年。由于生产不断发展，人民生活获得了很大改善。在解放前，贵州是一个缺粮的省份，要从外省运进粮食，从土地改革完成后，这种情况改变了，自一九五二年起至一九五六年底，我省共运出十五亿七千万斤粮食支援国家建设。少数民族地区的生产同样有了很大发展。去年进一步推行了民族区域自治政策，根据各少数民族聚居情况，建立了两个自治州、两个自治县（连原建立的共有三个自治县）和一百一十四个民族乡，各民族之间的团结加强了，大大发挥了少数民族人民的政治热情和生产积极性。几年来，政府积极扶持少数民族地区发展生产，发放了无偿农具、农业贷款和各种救济粮款，使民族地区生产得到不断发展。特别是在去年我省少数民族地区实现了农业合作化后，各民族自治地区都获得了增产，黔南自治州（包括三都自治县）去年粮食增产百分之十六；黔东南自治州增产百分之七以上；威宁自治县增产百分之十二点五；松桃自治县增产约百分之十一。几年来，随着生产的不断发展，就是原来极为贫穷的高寒贫瘠地区，各族人民的生活也大大改善了，据高寒贫瘠地区的威宁等十一县的统计，一九五○年粮食产量七亿一千二百万斤，一九五六年增加到十二亿三千四百万斤，增加了百分之七十三点三。又据威宁等五县调查，一九五二年每人平均买布一尺二寸三分，一九五六年每人平均买布九尺七寸，增加了七倍多；一九五二年每人平均买盐半斤多一点，一九五六年每人平均买盐三点五斤，增加了五倍。经过短短几年来的努力，少数民族地区的贫困落后的面貌已经起了显著的变化。贵州各族人民在党和人民政府领导下，过去很多人过着的那种没有粮食吃、没有盐巴吃、没有衣服穿的悲惨生活根本改变了。那些右派分子叫喊“少数民族地区合作社办糟了”、“人民生活没有改善”的荒谬言论，是在企图挑拨我们少数民族和党与人民政府的关系，破坏民族团结，反对社会主义。铁的事实把右派分子的阴谋粉碎了。我们的合作社办对了，办好了，生产发展了，人民生活大大改善了。合作化给各族人民带来了幸福，各族人民正在沿着社会主义的康庄大道胜利前进。
    注意山区少数民族特点
    在合作化运动高潮中，合作社发展很快，我们对民族政策宣传教育不够，有的少数民族地区曾经发生忽视民族特点的毛病，对少数民族风俗习惯照顾不够，把不该入社的“麻园地”、“采花坡”、“祭祀田”、“棉花地”、“牯?牛”等入了社，自留地也太少，在全省检查民族政策执行情况后，已经基本上作了纠正；但有的地区对少数民族生产的特殊需要还照顾不够，如对少数民族按照他们不同的习惯，他们生活必需的糯米、棉花、麻、蓝靛等，没有列入生产计划统筹安排；有的在生产时间上对民族节日照顾不够，如对苗族“四月八”、布依族“祭山”、“祭秧田”等节日，没有在安排生产时适当留出他们过节时间；在民族联合社中，有的没有按照各民族都应有相应比例的原则来安排社干，对于人口少的民族照顾不够，这些缺点还必须继续检查纠正。有的经济部门执行价格政策还存在一些问题，有的土特产品和经济作物的价格偏低；有的购销差价过大；有时还有压级压价的现象发生，这对生产不利，需要逐步适当加以调整。此外，我省高寒贫瘠山区，也就是大部分少数民族居住的地区，虽然生产有了很大发展，但由于土地贫瘠，耕作技术落后，作物的产量还很低，生产发展和人民生活水平还远远落后于我省中心地区。我们过去在工作上对这些地区的特殊困难照顾还不够，为使这些地区发展生产，繁荣经济，逐步地改变其落后状况，必须进一步加强领导，政府还应继续给予帮助和扶持。发动这些地区各族人民自己的力量，进行艰苦的劳动，贯彻“勤俭办社、民主办社”的方针，进一步发挥农业合作社的优越性。在保证粮食增产的前提下，积极开展多种经营，发展副业生产，例如望谟的青麻，威宁的畜业品，其他少数民族地区林业副业产品和土特产品等等。这样就可以逐步地改变这些地区的落后面貌，各族人民的生活也将随着生产的发展得到进一步提高。
    交通、工业、文教事业的发展
    我省交通极为不便，发展交通事业是促进山区经济发展的重要条件。几年来，我省修建公路和简易公路二千六百六十四公里，比解放前全省公路增加百分之七十四，少数民族地区修建了一千四百八十公里，使贵州的交通状况有了很大改善，促进了物资交流，许多土特产品得到了销路。但是，贵州的公路仍然很少，交通不便仍是很大的困难。目前还有些边沿县不通汽车，使边沿地区的许多土特产品还运不出来。必须逐步地发展这些地区交通运输事业。今后政府还应该继续投资修建一些公路，并继续发动各族人民多修建一些乡村驿道，发展畜力运输，逐步改变交通闭塞的状况，促进这些地区经济发展。
    大家都知道，贵州的工业是十分落后的，解放前几乎是没有什么工厂。解放几年来工业也有了很大发展，少数民族地区也建立了一些小型加工工厂。但工业仍然是很落后，贵州是有条件发展工业的，地上地下的资源都很丰富，少数民族地区也有着丰富的矿藏，林产品、棉、麻、毛、皮革等也都适宜发展轻工业。今后，应该进一步发展地方工业，多开办一些中小型轻工业。同时，我们希望中央有关部门今后在贵州安排一些工业项目，帮助贵州发展工业建设。今后新建企业和扩大企业时，我们还应当多注意吸收一些少数民族人民，培养少数民族的工人参加工业建设工作。
    由于生产的不断发展，我省文化教育事业也有很大发展。一九五六年大中小学在校学生已达一百五十多万人，较一九五○年增加了八倍半；其中少数民族学生已达三十四万多人，较一九五○年增加了十四倍半。在文教工作上，今后还要进一步提高教育质量，加强劳动教育。同时，由于我省教育事业原来很落后，学校和学生人数的发展比起先进地区来还是少，少数民族人民文化更为落后。今后，还需要逐步地继续发展，在边沿的少数民族地区还要适当地增设一些学校，并有计划地加强培养少数民族的各种专业人才。
    肃反运动的伟大胜利
    我省肃反运动，由于坚决贯彻执行了“有反必肃、有错必纠”的方针，充分发动了群众，已取得了伟大的胜利。在肃反斗争过程中，由于群众对反革命分子的义愤，斗争了极少数虽有罪恶，但可斗可不斗的人，甚至错斗了个别完全不应斗争的人，是完全可以理解的，同时，一经发现就坚决作了纠正。但是，在已经结束肃反运动的地方，有的单位还发现了有漏掉的反革命分子，据贵阳市市级机关的检查就漏掉了十三个反革命分子，如贵阳市粮食局反革命分子张莲安，解放后当土匪营长，杀害革命干部三名，于一九五二年镇反时改名换姓，伪造历史，混入粮食局做工人，假装积极，后被提为干部，该局在肃反运动结束后，才发现他的真实姓名，经调查证实他是一个有血债、有民愤的反革命分子；省化工公司反革命分子贺钰河，抗战时曾参加我游击队，后投敌叛变，充当日伪汉奸和密探，由于他告密致使革命干部和农民七人残遭日寇杀害，也是在肃反运动结束后才发现查出来的。又如省统计局反革命分子何运寿，解放后参加土匪，刺探军事情报，抢劫粮食仓库，任意殴打农民，群众极为愤恨，肃反斗争结束后错误的将其平反，平反后引起了机关干部和当地群众极为不满，最后才经司法机关依法进行处理。这就充分说明了，经过肃反斗争，反革命分子虽已基本肃清，但是，事实证明反革命分子是非常狡猾的，还有漏掉的反革命分子未完全彻底肃清，建议中央公安、检察有关部门，对这种情况要特别重视。我们应当继续保持高度警惕，继续贯彻执行“有反必肃、有错必纠”的方针，彻底肃清一切反革命分子，保障社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。在肃反斗争中，有些右派分子大喊大叫，他们说“肃反搞错了”，“大部分斗错了”，甚至说“百分之九十以上斗错了”。这完全是颠倒是非的胡说，我要问这些右派分子，你们为什么对漏掉的反革命分子一字不提？难道你们想要多保留点反革命分子才好吗？你们居心何在？你们不可告人的阴谋，我们各族人民是绝不能容许的，对于反革命分子，我们要坚决全部彻底肃清，巩固人民民主专政，保卫我们伟大的社会主义事业。
    在社会主义道路上继续前进
    几年来，贵州的经济文教事业已经有了很大的发展，各项工作获得了很大成绩。但由于贵州底子穷，生产水平还不高，人民生活还低，我们必须继续努力，我们相信，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，加强各族人民的亲密团结，克服工作中的缺点，贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，我们一定能够在现有基础上获得新的更大的发展。我们贵州原来是极为贫穷落后的地区，短短几年，就获得这样巨大的成就，少数民族人民在政治、经济和文化各方面得到飞跃发展，这只有在共产党的领导下才能办到的，我们各族人民对党衷心拥护。我要正告右派分子，你们反党反社会主义的阴谋，我们是绝不能容忍的，我们和各兄弟民族人民一道坚决反对，我们永远跟着共产党、毛主席走，坚决走社会主义的道路，为建设伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
