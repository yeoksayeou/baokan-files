This is How She Came to Be
—An Interview with NPC Deputy Wu Yifang
By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

At the National People's Congress, I met a delegate from Jiangsu Province. He said, "Wu Yifang's speech in our group was very good and greatly enlightened me."

The sixty-four-year-old Ms. Wu Yifang served as the president of Ginling Women's College for more than twenty years.

Ms. Wu Yifang was very straightforward. As soon as she met the reporter, she went straight to the point, saying, "Rightists talk about supporting the Communist Party, but when it comes to specific issues, they disapprove of this and disagree with that! At the group meetings, they claim they can't find the problems in their own thinking and want others to help them find the root of their problems. Some rightists say their thinking changes every day, making reform sound incredibly easy." She said with emotion, "If it goes on like this, they will never find the root of their problems! Reform is a painful process of self-struggle; it's not that easy!"

I asked her to talk about her own experiences.

She talked about the ideological reform movement of 1952.

At that time, many people criticized those who worked in missionary schools as serving imperialism and cultivating slaves for imperialism. She was very angry when she heard this criticism. She believed that she had worked hard to run the school for decades so that women could also go to university and work in society. How could this be said to be cultivating slaves for imperialism! Besides, she didn't even hang the American flag at the school when Japanese planes were bombing the most fiercely. At the very least, patriotic thought and national consciousness should be affirmed!

One day, a comrade kindly came to help her. To remind her, he said, "Many people who work in missionary schools have compradore ideas. You can also check yourself!" She became even angrier when she heard this. Compradore? She knew what a compradore looked like, like that ghastly manager of Standard Oil. How could she be like that? As a result, she stopped thinking.

Professor Chen Yifan (the head of the Chinese Language Department at Ginling Women's College) asked her a question one day: "What did you think after the Southern Anhui Incident? Did you think about the future of the Chinese people at that time?" This question really stumped her. That night, she didn't close her eyes all night. She thought over and over again that after the Southern Anhui Incident, she was in Chengdu, and people sent her the Xinhua Daily every day, but she didn't even look at it. She confined herself within the walls of the missionary school, as long as the school was well-organized, the United States continued to fund it, and her position was secure, she didn't care what was happening outside! It didn't matter to me that they were fighting to the death outside! She asked herself: Isn't this locking yourself in an ivory tower? Isn't this treating the school as a cultural concession? Isn't this being isolated from the people? Everything in the school had to listen to the American trustees. Whatever the Americans said was what it was. Many of the lectures and readings in the school were directly imported from American textbooks, even sociology was taught from original American books. There were so many American teachers in the school, and many department heads and registrars were Americans. Isn't this spreading American culture? The students spoke fluent foreign languages, admired America, yearned for America, and talked about how good everything was in America! Yes, she also told the students every day to serve society, but what kind of society was it serving? Who was the object of service? When the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movements broke out, the students were excited and wanted to strike and march, but she persuaded them to study peacefully at school. How could she be worthy of the people! Thinking like this, she felt useless and that there was a problem with her position. Isn't this compradore thinking? Wasn't she an agent of imperialism? She was ashamed to show her face.

"Of course, ideological reform is not a matter of one or two days. In the past few years, after several major movements, plus I often go out and run around, my understanding has improved slightly," Wu Yifang said.

In 1953, she and some members of the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference went to visit the Sanhe Dam on the Huai River. The tens of thousands of workers there were extremely happy to see them and told them everything. The villagers said that they had harvests in only one out of ten years. They had been waiting and hoping for generations for a dam. During the Kuomintang era, they said they would build a dam, but after several years, they only drove a few dozen piles. But now, in less than a year, the dam was about to be completed. A national capitalist who was traveling with them said after listening, "Now I have personally seen that the people's government takes from the people and uses it for the people!" He saw where the profits his factory turned over were being used. A member of the Political Consultative Conference who had worked in the Kuomintang Control Yuan talked about the breach of the Grand Canal before liberation. He went to investigate the disaster. The local people cried to him, saying that when the flood came, a ship came from afar. When the villagers saw it, they were happy and shouted. But the ship picked up the officials of the "Huai River Guidance Committee" and turned around and left. No one paid attention to the people crying and shouting. How could it be like the current government, which takes the people into consideration in everything!

The year before, Wu Yifang visited Japan. She met many Japanese who had recently been to China. Those Japanese teachers, workers, staff, and capitalists all said to her in unison that China was able to achieve such achievements in such a short period of time, on such a rotten foundation, which was something they never expected. They praised China's achievements in economic, cultural, and educational undertakings, and they especially talked about the changes in the moral outlook of the Chinese people. There were no more prostitutes in China, no more pawnshops (there are many pawnshops in Japan), and if you stayed in a hotel, you wouldn't lose anything if you didn't close the door. After a civil servant visited China, he wrote a book about China and gave it to Wu Yifang. One passage in the book reads, "In the past, when Chinese people encountered difficulties, they always said, 'There's no way.' Now they say, 'There are difficulties, but there are ways to overcome them.'" The people of New China proudly say, "We want to make the mountains bow their heads, and we want to make the rivers give way." They are happily working for the motherland.

As she spoke, she took out two pieces of paper from her document bag. She said, "This is my speaking outline. I am going to talk about my experience after listening to Premier Zhou's report at the group meeting." I looked at it and saw the following written on it:

"Where did the achievements come from? Rely on the leadership of the Party. Such as increased agricultural production, overcoming natural disasters... Impossible without the leadership of the Party.

Reasons for the success of the Party's leadership:

① Selfless ② Dialectics..."

Seeing that I had finished reading, Wu Yifang hurriedly said, "In the past few years, I feel that no matter what, there is no problem with supporting the Communist Party and taking the road of socialism. But in fact, when it comes to specific issues, my thoughts and feelings are still far away!"

She said that when Zhang Bojun proposed the "Political Design Institute" this time, she didn't pay attention to it at first and didn't expect any conspiracy in it. Then she talked about her feelings after the People's Daily published the editorial "What is the reason for this" in early June. She said that she was extremely worried at the time. At a symposium of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, she asked the Provincial Party Committee whether it was going to "take back." She said with concern that the situation in Beijing and Jiangsu might not be exactly the same. The Provincial Party Committee should pay attention to the specific situation in the province. The opinions that have been put forward in the past should be implemented immediately, otherwise the masses will not dare to express their opinions. And they will blame the Communist Party!

"Looking back now, I feel funny, but that's how I thought at the time. I even thought I was saying these things to protect the Party. In fact, this is because I don't have enough understanding of the importance of correctly criticizing. After I came to Beijing, after group discussions, and after reading many People's Daily editorials, especially after listening to Premier Zhou's report, my mind was opened. You say, if the reactionary fallacies of the rightists are not criticized, many people will not be able to distinguish between right and wrong, and those who are not firm in their positions will follow the rightists. What kind of consequences will that have? If these major principles are wrong, they must be criticized."

Talking about the issue of "democracy," Mr. Wu said that Premier Zhou's report explained this very thoroughly. She said that when she was studying in the United States, she often heard the school's professors and students say that a certain member of parliament was the boss of a large company, and a certain member of parliament was a large landlord in a certain place. They often quarreled in parliament. For example, a member of parliament who was in the business of making vegetable oil advocated lowering the price of butter, while a landlord member of parliament who raised cattle to produce butter strongly disagreed, so they quarreled. This is American "democracy." And what about us? We consider issues from the interests of 600 million people in everything. We want to ensure that 600 million people have food to eat and jobs to do. This is true democracy, this is the greatest democracy, but many intellectuals often can't figure this out, and when they think about problems, they always forget the 600 million people and always think about themselves.

She also talked about some other issues, saying that she had gradually clarified these issues in her thinking. But at group discussions, sometimes her speeches were not strong enough, and she couldn't tear off her face and criticize the rightists face to face. This shows that her sense of responsibility as a master is not enough.

Wu Yifang stopped for a while and then continued, "The biggest problem with intellectuals is that they only talk and don't act. Many people shout all day long: 'Theory must be combined with practice!' What about practice? They only 'understand' the theory of 'combining theory with practice.' They stand on the shore and watch the workers and peasants row towards socialism. They point fingers and do nothing. Some people are a little better and get on the boat, but they just stand on the boat and look at the scenery. How can this work!"

She said that socialism is an important test for intellectuals.

Speaking of this, she told a story:

Someone once asked the younger Tolstoy a question: "You were a writer in the old Russia, how could you achieve such great achievements under the Soviet regime?" The younger Tolstoy immediately said after hearing this, "When I understood the new society and accepted the new ideas, I put my whole body and mind, my whole thoughts and feelings into it."

"What many intellectuals lack is exactly this. Reform is a lifelong thing. I must continue to work hard to reform myself and dedicate all my thoughts and feelings to the cause of communism!" she said.

Wu Yifang is now the Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province. Recalling the road she has traveled, and in connection with Premier Zhou's report, she said: "The door of the Communist Party is open to everyone. Anyone who makes a mistake, as long as he admits his mistake and is willing to correct it, the people and the Party welcome him." She said that she has deeply experienced this in her work, and this has deeply moved her.

    她是这样走过来的
    ——人大代表吴贻芳访问记
    本报记者　傅冬
    在人代会上，遇到一位江苏省的代表。他说：“吴贻芳在我们小组的发言很好，给我的启发很大。”
    六十四岁的吴贻芳先生，在金陵女大作过二十多年的校长。
    吴贻芳先生很痛快，一见到记者，就开门见山地说：“右派分子口口声声说拥护共产党，可是一碰到具体问题，他们就这不赞成，那不同意！在小组会上又推说自己检查不出自己思想的毛病，要别人帮他们找毛病的根子。有的右派分子说自己思想一天一个样，把改造说得容易的了不得。”她感慨地说：“要是老这样，那一辈子也查不出毛病的根子！改造是一场痛苦的自我斗争过程，哪里那么容易！”
    我请她谈谈自己的体会。
    她谈起1952年的思想改造运动。
    那时候，好些人批评在教会学校作事的人，是给帝国主义服务的，给帝国主义培养奴才。她听了这种批评，非常生气。她认为自己辛辛苦苦办了几十年学校，为的是叫女子也能上大学，也能到社会上作事。这怎么能说是为帝国主义培养奴才呢！再说，日本飞机轰炸得最厉害的时候，她都没有叫在学校里挂美国旗。不管怎样，至少爱国思想、民族意识，这点总应该肯定吧！
    有一天，一个同志好心地来帮助她，为了提醒她，说了这么一句：“很多在教会学校作事的人有买办思想，你也可以检查检查！”她一听更火了。买办？她可知道买办是什么样子，就像美孚洋行经理那副鬼样子，自己怎么会是那样的？这样一来，她更不动脑子了。
    陈一凡教授（金陵女大中国语文系的系主任）有天对她提了一个问题：“皖南事变以后，你怎么想的？你那时有没有想过中国人民的前途？”这一问，倒真把她给问住了。那一夜，她整晚没阖眼。她翻来复去地想，皖南事变后在成都，天天有人给她寄新华日报，可是她连看都不看一眼。自己把自己圈在教会学校的围墙里，只要学校整得有条有理，美国继续来经费，自己地位没问题就行了，管它外面闹成什么样子！外面打得你死我活，也与我无关！她问自己：这不是把自己关在象牙塔里是什么？这不是把学校当成文化租界是什么？这不是与人民隔绝又是什么？学校事事都得听美国校董的话，美国人说什么是什么。学校里讲的念的，好些都是原封不动地从美国搬来的教材，连社会学都念的是美国原文书。学校的美国先生多极了，好些系主任和教务员都是美国人。这不是传播美国文化是什么？学生们满嘴洋文，她们羡慕美国，向往美国，谈起来什么都是美国的好！是的，自己整天也给学生讲要为社会服务，但究竟为什么社会服务？服务的对象究竟是谁？反饥饿、反内战运动勃发的时候，学生的情绪激昂，要罢课、游行，自己却劝她们安心在校读书。这怎么能对得起人民！这么一想，她觉得自己一无是处，立场是有问题。这不是买办思想是什么？自己不是帝国主义的代理人又是什么？她羞得抬不起头来见人了。
      “当然，思想改造不是一天、两天的事。这几年，经过几次大的运动，加上自己也常出去跑跑，认识上稍稍提高了些。”吴贻芳这样说。
    1953年，她和一些江苏省的政协委员去参观淮河的三河闸。那里的几万民工见他们去了，高兴得不得了，给他们说东道西。老乡说，他们那里十年九不收。他们盼呀！盼呀！盼了几辈子了，盼望能有个闸。国民党时，说要建闸，可是建了几年，只打了几十根桩子。而现在不到一年工夫，这座闸就要建成了。同行的一个民族资本家听了说：“现在我亲眼看到人民政府取之于民，用之于民了！”他看到了他的工厂上缴利润用在那里了。一位曾在国民党监察院作过事的政协委员谈起了解放前运河决口的事。那次他去调查灾情。当地的老百姓哭着对他说，当发大水的时候，远远来了一条轮船。老乡见了，都高兴得叫起来了。那知道轮船把“导淮委员会”的官员接到船上，就调转身走了。任老百姓哭死、喊死，也没人理。哪像现在政府这样处处为老百姓打算呢！
    头年，吴贻芳去日本访问。见到许多最近来过中国的日本人。那些日本的教师、工人、职员、资本家，都异口同声地对她说，中国能够在那么短的时间里，在那么烂的摊子上，作出这样的成绩，真是万万想不到的事情。他们称赞中国的经济、文化、教育事业的成就，他们特别谈到了中国人民道德面貌的改变。中国没妓女了，没当铺了（日本当铺很多），住旅馆，不关门也不会丢东西。一位公务员访问中国以后，写了一本有关中国的书，送给吴贻芳。书中有一段这样写着，中国人过去遇到困难，总是说：“没办法”，现在他们说：“有困难，但有办法克服”。新中国的人民自豪地说：“我们要让高山低头，我们要让河水让路。”他们很愉快地在为祖国劳动着。
    她说着从文件袋里拿出两张纸来，她说：“这是我的发言提纲。我准备在小组会上谈谈我听周总理报告后的体会。”我看了一下，见上面写着：
    “成绩那里来的？靠党的领导。如农业增产、战胜灾荒……没党领导不可能。
    党领导成功的原因：
    ①大公无私　②辩证法……”
    吴贻芳见我看完了，忙说：“这几年自己觉得不管怎样，拥护共产党、走社会主义的路这点没问题了。可是事实上遇到具体问题，思想感情还离得老远呢！”
    她说，这一次章伯钧提出“政治设计院”的时候，开始她就没注意，没想到这里面有什么阴谋。接着她又谈到6月初，当人民日报发表“这是为什么”那篇社论后她的心情。她说当时她担心极了。在江苏省委的一个座谈会上，她问省委，是不是要“收”了。她关心地说，北京和江苏的情况不一定完全一样。省委应注意省里的具体情况，过去提的意见，能执行的马上执行，不然群众不敢提意见了。而且会怪共产党！
      “现在想起来觉得好笑，而当时确实是那样想的。自己还觉得是为了爱护党才说这样的话。实际上，这是对正确反批评的重要性认识得不够。我这种思想，到北京后，经过小组讨论，加上看了许多人民日报的社论，特别是听了周总理的报告，脑子才算开窍了。你说，要是对右派的反动谬论不进行批判，好些人弄不清是非，立场不坚定的就会跟着右派分子跑，那会产生什么样的后果，这些大的原则问题错了，一定得批判。”
    谈到了“民主”这个问题，吴先生说，周总理报告里，这点说得透彻极了。她说，她在美国念书的时候，常听见学校的教授和同学说，某某议员是什么大公司的老板，某某议员是什么地方的大地主。他们常常在议会上吵架。比如这个作植物油生意的议员主张降低黄油价，而那个养牛的生产黄油的地主议员死不同意，这样他们就吵起来了。这就是美国的“民主”。而我们呢？事事从六亿人民的利益出发考虑问题，我们要让六亿人民有饭吃，有工作做，这是真正的民主，这是最大的民主，而好些知识分子在这点上常闹不清楚，想问题总忘了六亿人民，老想着自己个人。
    她还谈到另外一些问题，她说那些问题她在思想上也渐渐明确起来了。可是在小组讨论会上，有时自己的发言还不那么坚强，还不能撕破面子，脸对脸地批驳右派分子。这说明自己的主人翁责任感还不够。
    吴贻芳停了一会，又接着说，知识分子最大的毛病，就是光说不作。好些人一天到晚嚷嚷：“理论要结合实际呀！”实际呢？他们只“懂”了“理论结合实际”的理论。他们站在岸上看工人、农民向社会主义划船，他们指手划脚，却从不动手。有些人好一些，上了船，但也只是站在船上看风景。这怎么能行呢！
    她说，社会主义这一关对知识分子是个重要的考验。
    讲到这里，她说了一个故事：
    有人曾经问过小托尔斯泰一个问题：“你是旧俄时候的文人，你怎么能在苏维埃政权下得到那么大的成就？”小托尔斯泰听了马上说，当我认识了新社会，接受了新思想，我就把我的整个身心，整个思想感情都投到里面了。”
      “好些知识分子缺少的正是这个。改造是一辈子的事。我一定要继续努力自我改造，把自己的全部思想感情献给共产主义事业！”她这样表示。
    吴贻芳现在是江苏省的副省长。她回忆着她走过的道路，联系到周总理的报告，她说：“共产党的大门对所有的人都是开着的。任何人犯了错误，只要承认错误，愿意改正，那人民和党是欢迎他的。”她说，这点她在工作中体会很深，这点深深地感动了她。
