Learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army
——Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
Guo Moruo

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been established for thirty years. This is an invincible army created under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese people were able to liberate themselves from the painful fate of being enslaved, dig up the old roots of feudalism, shatter the chains of colonialism, and establish a new China under the people's democratic dictatorship, mainly relying on this army.

This is a revolutionary army, a national defense army, and at the same time a production army and a cultural army. The development history of this army is an unprecedented revolutionary history. It has grown from nothing, from small to large, from weak to strong, and has been tempered by the flames of revolutionary struggle, and has become a strong force for defending the socialist motherland, defending peace in Asia, and defending world peace.

This army, under the leadership of the Party, is constantly receiving Marxist-Leninist training. It is not a simple army, but the people's army, an army that serves the people, an army that seeks liberation for the people and independence for the motherland. Now that the people are liberated and the motherland is independent, it not only guarantees the safety of the people and defends the borders of the motherland day and night, but also frequently engages in production and construction and cultural and educational construction.

Let us think about how many production and construction projects have been completed by the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the eight years since liberation! How many railways, highways, bridges, and factories have they built? How many farmlands have they reclaimed, how many water conservancy projects have they built, how much food have they produced, and how many disaster victims have they rescued?

The People's Liberation Army is an extremely large comprehensive university, and how much valuable knowledge the soldiers have learned here! Revolutionary experience, military technology, production technology, and knowledge of various sciences, arts, culture, and education! The soldiers have learned this knowledge, played the role of liberating and defending the people, and educated the people. We should clearly realize that for thirty years, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have also been teachers of the people, setting an example in moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, and technical education, and spreading their education to the whole of China. They have played a role in changing customs and habits imperceptibly.

The People's Liberation Army is an extremely large steelmaking furnace. This steelmaking furnace has a high degree of political technology. Raw ore and even scrap iron are quickly smelted into steel when they are thrown into this steelmaking furnace. We know that the soldiers do not all come from the working class. Many of them are farmers, and many are petty-bourgeois elements. During the revolutionary struggle, many people came from the counter-revolutionary camp. Once these people surrendered or revolted, they quickly transformed into revolutionary soldiers.

These are, of course, amazing miracles.

Why can such miracles happen? Facts tell us that it is because this army is led by the Communist Party and is constantly receiving Marxist-Leninist education. The purpose of Marxism-Leninism is to liberate the people, liberate the productive forces of the people, and continuously improve material and spiritual production under the system of public ownership, so that the people can enjoy continuously improving happiness in material and cultural life, under the leadership of the working class vanguard. Such doctrine is selfless. The Party with such doctrine as its leading ideology, and the army led by such a Party, are equally selfless. Entering such a Party and such an army will naturally receive due training and become a selfless person. Of course, there may be a few exceptions. Any steelmaking furnace will inevitably discharge some slag.

If a person is selfless, he can become a steel warrior, risking life and death and persevering in revolutionary struggles. Can an army composed of millions of such steel warriors fail to produce revolutionary miracles? As long as people with eyes and conscience, even enemies can see that the victory of the Chinese revolution is a very great historical event in modern human history, and its importance and the victory of the Soviet Socialist October Revolution are like brothers. The face of Chinese society has changed in the past eight years and is continuing to change, and the character of the Chinese people is also changing.

Under the leadership of the Party, Chinese society has completed the bourgeois democratic revolution and basically completed the socialist revolution. For a hundred years, our ancestors have continuously pursued their ideals, and have constantly adopted bloody means to pursue them, but they have failed to achieve them. Under the leadership of the Party, in a short period of time, and in a state of peaceful transition, they have been realized. The historical tasks of the past one hundred years have been overfulfilled. Who can say this is not a miracle?

As old China was reduced to a semi-colony, the Chinese people were humiliated for decades. Foreigners scolded us as "sick men of East Asia" and "inferior races." We could not hold our heads high in front of others. - When I write this, tears are still swelling in my eyes and causing pain. Today's young people do not know this pain deeply, but those of us in our sixties cannot forget it so easily. But in just a few years, what has become of today's "sick men of East Asia" and "inferior races"? Of course, we should not be complacent at all, and we should never be complacent; instead, we should not forget the suffering we have endured before, and even more so, we should not forget that our compatriots in Taiwan and the oppressed peoples and oppressed classes in various countries around the world are still suffering the same pain. However, the Chinese people, who have suffered all kinds of humiliation, have raised their heads in just a few years. Who can say this is not a miracle?

The liberated people and the liberated productive forces of the people are bound to produce amazing miracles. What's more, we are a nation of 600 million people! Such a large productive force has been liberated and is still producing a chain reaction. This is by no means comparable to the power released by atomic nuclei.

We cannot but thank the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army led by the Party for making these miracles happen. To consolidate our revolutionary achievements and build a socialist society, we must further closely rely on the Party and resolutely accept the leadership of the Party; we must further cherish our People's Liberation Army and learn from the People's Liberation Army - learn from our steel warriors how they are trained in Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of the Party, so that they have strict discipline and easy freedom, unified will and lively personality development, high degree of concentration and broad democracy.

There are currently about five million intellectuals in China. If this force could also have the spirit of the People's Liberation Army, how much power would it exert in cultural, educational, and production construction! However, regrettably, this army of intellectuals is particularly poorly organized. We are naturally inferior to the working class and the peasantry, and even seem to lag behind the business community. I am not just saying this off the top of my head. Look at the recent anti-Party and anti-socialist agitation by the rightists. Of course, there are rightists in the business community, but intellectuals account for the vast majority of rightists, and many of them are giants and backbones. This is worth our deep self-reflection.

We intellectuals have received several years of socialist education under the leadership of the Party, but we have not understood it deeply enough. We have been too deeply poisoned by the legacy of old-style education, and our spirits are still filled with old-style ideology, and new education is not easy to penetrate. Seriously speaking, the spirits of some of us still need to be liberated, like "Taiwan." Such people demand unconditional freedom, unlimited personal interests, and absolute democracy. Such people engage in agitation whenever they have the opportunity, or follow suit when they are incited. We can see this clearly in the rampant attacks of the rightists this time.

Therefore, in the current struggle against the rightists, when we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we intellectuals should make a special effort to examine ourselves deeply.

How much contribution have we intellectuals made to the Chinese revolution and Chinese construction? In particular, please compare ourselves with the steel warriors. You don't have to be afraid of not knowing the goods, you're only afraid of comparing goods. With this comparison, we should frankly admit that we are really pitiful and ashamed.

I don't want to obliterate everything and attack the enthusiasm of intellectuals; the fact is that, generally speaking, our negativity is too serious. We are actually far behind the development of the times, and some people turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, still arrogantly belittling others and full of grievances. I am not going to spread the issue fully here, but only want to point out our backwardness with two facts, especially to my friends in the literary and art circles.

The first is the 25,000-li Long March. What an earth-shattering miracle! Comrade Li Bozhao wrote an opera on this subject. Comrade Dong Xiweng once followed the traces of the Long March to seek painting materials and made many sketches. These efforts are worthy of respect. In addition, Comrade Chen Qitong's "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains" drama was written relatively successfully and performed relatively successfully. There are also some other sporadic works, but I always feel that the spirit is not enough, and the writer's strength seems to be overwhelmed by the greatness of the historical facts. Recently, I watched the color documentary "On the Road of the Long March" produced by the General Political Department of the Military Commission, and it was very well made and very beautiful! This is a very commendable film. The disadvantage is that the scenery is too beautiful, making it easy to ignore the arduous and indomitable spirit of the Party leaders and the Long March soldiers, and therefore it will not be easy to appreciate the extremely important significance of the Long March in the history of Chinese liberation and human liberation.

But I often feel strange. We also have many excellent writers in China, new or old, but why has no one ever had the ambition to write this epic of the Long March? Perhaps someone is already writing it, but I am ignorant and ill-informed. I hope that is the case. Of course, I should also condemn myself. I am also someone who wields a pen, but my pen is far inferior to the poles on the Wujiang River and the Dadu River. In order to commemorate the Long March and the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, I suggest that the Writers Association organize a group of comrades who are willing and able to work like the production of "On the Road of the Long March," using their pens to produce it separately. It is best to set out a five-year plan or a ten-year plan to create a great work to commemorate the 35th or 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. Although I already belong to the "old man" category, if I am considered qualified, I am also very willing to participate in this work.

The second is the movement of the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. That was also such a great miracle! We defeated the number one imperialist with absolutely inferior equipment. The mountains bowed and the rivers made way in front of the Volunteers and the heroic Korean People's Army. Similarly, thanks to the General Political Department of the Military Commission for compiling and printing two important readings for us - "The Biography of Volunteer Heroes" and "One Day of the Volunteers." There are also good documentaries about the war to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, especially "Shangganling." In my opinion, these are not only the spiritual food of the general readers and audiences, but especially the spiritual food of literary and art writers. The writers here also seem to show excessive malnutrition and spiritual depression. In this great movement, how insufficient the efforts of our professional writers have been! Perhaps there are also people who are working hard to create and carefully construct, but I don't know about it. I hope that is the case.

Some friends in the literary and art circles are very dissatisfied with the literary and art situation after liberation. Dissatisfaction is acceptable, but the understanding is wrong. They believe that there is not enough freedom, not enough democracy, and that individuality is too constrained, so there are no good works or great works produced. In my opinion, it is probably the opposite. There is too much freedom and democracy, so individual efforts are too relaxed. In the past thirty years, there have been many great historical events in China. No one has restricted you - prohibiting you from writing, or prohibiting you from publishing what you have written. However, some people with writing ability stay in Beijing or Shanghai, doing nothing but watching the wall. If you are unwilling to work hard to write things, you will naturally have nothing, not to mention whether it is great or not. Who can you blame for this? In my opinion, the current situation in the literary and art circles is really not that there is not enough democracy, but that there is not enough concentration; not that there is too little freedom, but that there is too little discipline; not that individuality cannot be developed, but that the unified will to develop individuality in socialist cultural construction has not been well established, that is to say, everyone has not yet grasped Marxism-Leninism very well. As a result, many people are not clear about what is right and wrong at critical moments, and even confuse the enemy with ourselves. How can you write something that meets the requirements of the times in this way? How can you play the role you should in the cause of socialist construction? Literary and art writers are known as "soul engineers." If there are still problems with their own souls, how can they process the souls of others?

As I have said, I do not want to specifically accuse the literary and art circles. The fact is that the intellectual circles in China generally have the same situation. That is, we are still far behind the times. Chinese society has established socialist relations of production, but our ideology cannot keep up. On the basis of socialist relations of production, the superstructure of socialist ideology has not yet been established. This is a very large internal contradiction of the people at present.

To overcome this contradiction, the responsibility must fall more on the shoulders of us intellectuals. If we intellectuals want to complete this responsibility, we should not pursue more freedom today, but should pursue more discipline; we should not pursue more democracy, but should pursue more concentration. If we want to develop our individuality better, we must establish a unified will and common understanding to serve socialist construction more quickly.

We have a very good model at present, that is, the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by the Party. This army has accepted and is constantly accepting strict Marxist-Leninist training under the banner of Mao Zedong. Its characteristics are that it is both concentrated and democratic, both disciplined and free, both has a unified will and a lively development of individuality. It is because China has this invincible army that it can win the victory of the People's Liberation War and ensure the fruits of revolutionary victory.

If our current army of five million intellectuals is truly organized to have the spirit of the People's Liberation Army, I want to say it again, how much power would it exert in the cause of socialist cultural, educational, and production construction. Therefore, I want to shout to the patriotic intellectuals who are determined to support socialism and accept the leadership of the Party:

Let us learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    向中国人民解放军看齐
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年
    郭沫若
    中国人民解放军建军以来三十周年了。这是在中国共产党领导下所创造的一支战无不胜的军队。
    中国人民能够从惨痛的被人奴役的命运中解放出来，挖断了封建主义的老根，粉碎了殖民主义的锁链，建立了人民民主专政的新中国，主要就是靠着这支军队。
    这是一支革命大军、国防大军，而同时又是一支生产大军、文化大军。这支大军的发展史是一部史无先例的革命史。它从无到有、从小到大、从弱到强，经过了革命斗争的烈火锻炼，已经成为了保卫社会主义祖国、保卫亚洲和平、保卫世界和平的雄厚力量。
    这支军队在党的领导下是不断接受着马克思列宁主义的训练的。它不是单纯的军队，而是人民的军队，为人民服务的军队，为人民求解放、为祖国谋独立的军队。人民解放了，祖国独立了，它不仅日日夜夜在保障人民的安全、捍卫祖国的边疆，而且经常在从事生产建设和文教建设。
    我们请想想，解放以来八年间多少生产建设事业是由人民解放军的战士们所完成的！他们修建了多少铁路、公路、桥梁和工厂？他们开垦了多少农田、兴建了多少水利、生产了多少食粮，抢救了多少灾民？
    人民解放军是一座极其宏大的综合大学，战士们在这里是学会了多少宝贵的知识呀！革命经验、军事技术、生产技术、各种科学、艺术、文化、教育的知识！战士们学会了这些知识，发挥了解放人民、保卫人民的作用，并教育了人民。我们应该明确地认识到：三十年来的人民解放军的战士们同时是人民的老师，他们在德育、智育、体育、美育、技育各方面树立了楷模，把他们的教养向全中国传播了。他们是在潜移默化之中起了移风易俗的作用。
    人民解放军是一座极其宏大的炼钢炉。这座炼钢炉具有高度的政治技术，原始的矿石乃至废铁，一投进这座炼钢炉里，便很快被熔炼成为钢铁。我们知道：战士们并不都是来自工人阶级，其中有很多是农民，还有不少的小资产阶级分子。在革命斗争期间，更有不少是从反革命阵营里过来的人，这些人一经投诚或起义，很快就转化为革命的战士。
    这些当然是惊人的奇迹。
    为什么能产生这样的奇迹呢？事实告诉我们，就是由于这支大军是共产党领导的，是经常受着马克思列宁主义的教育的。马克思列宁主义的宗旨，就是要以工人阶级先锋队为领导，解放人民，解放人民的生产力，在全民所有制之下，不断提高物质生产和精神生产，使人民在物质生活和文化生活方面享受着不断提高的幸福。这样的主义是大公无私的。以这样的主义为领导思想的党、为这样的党所领导的军队同样是大公无私的。投入了这样的党和这样的军队里，自然便会受到应有的锻炼而成为大公无私的人。当然，也可能有少数例外。任何炼钢炉总不免要倾除出一些渣滓的。
    一个人如果大公无私，那就可以成为钢铁战士，在革命斗争中出生入死、百折不挠。由几百万这样的钢铁战士所组成的军队，难道还不能产生出革命的奇迹吗？只要是有眼睛、有良知的人，连敌人也可以看到：中国革命的胜利是人类近代史上的一项很伟大的历史事件，它的重要性和苏联社会主义十月革命的胜利是难兄难弟。八年来中国社会的面貌是改变了，而且正在继续改变着，中国人民的性格也在改变着。
    中国社会在党的领导下，已经完成了资产阶级民主革命，并且基本上完成了社会主义革命。百年来我们的先人们不断地追求、而且不断地采取了流血的手段来追求而却求之不得的理想，在党的领导下，短短的期间，并在和平过渡的状态下，被实现了。一百年来的历史任务被超额完成了。这谁能说不是奇迹？
    随着旧中国被沦陷为半殖民地，中国人民被人凌辱了几十年。外国人骂我们是“东亚病夫”，是“劣等民族”，我们在人面前抬不起头来——我写到这里，眼泪还鼓胀着我的眼睛发痛。这惨痛，在今天的青少年知道得很不深刻，但在我们这一辈六十前后的人是不能那么健忘的。但是仅仅几年，今天的
  “东亚病夫”、“劣等民族”是怎样了？当然，我们一点也不应该骄傲自满，永远也不应该骄傲自满；倒应该不要忘记我们以前受过的痛苦，更不要忘记我们的台湾同胞和世界各国被压迫民族、被压迫阶级还在受着同样的痛苦。但是，受尽侮辱的中国人民，几年之间是抬起头来了。这谁能说不是奇迹？
    解放了的人民，解放了的人民生产力，是要产生出惊人的奇迹的。何况我们还是六亿人口的民族！这样大的生产力量被解放了出来，而且还在发生链锁作用，这决不是原子核解放出的力量所能比拟的。
    使这些奇迹产生了出来，我们不能不感谢中国共产党，不能不感谢党所领导的人民解放军。我们要巩固我们的革命成果，要建成社会主义社会，今后就必须更进一步紧密地靠拢党、坚决接受党的领导；就必须更进一步爱护我们的人民解放军，向人民解放军学习——学习我们的钢铁战士们在党的领导下受着马克思列宁主义的锻炼，那样地既有谨严的纪律、又有舒畅的自由，既有统一的意志、又有活泼的个性发展，既有高度的集中、又有广泛的民主。
    我们中国目前有约五百万人的知识分子。假使这一支队伍也能够有人民解放军那样的精神，那在文教建设上和生产建设上是会要发挥多么大的力量呵！但是，遗憾得很，我们这支知识分子大军组织得却特别差。我们和工人阶级、农民阶级比较起来自然比不上，甚至连和工商界比较起来似乎都要落后。我这样说并不是信口开河。请看这次右派分子的反党、反社会主义的蠢动吧。工商界中当然也有右派分子，然而在右派分子中知识分子却占绝大多数，而且多是一些巨头和骨干。这就值得我们加以深刻的自省了。
    我们知识分子在党的领导下是受了几年的社会主义教育的，然而我们体会得很不够。我们受旧式教育的遗毒太深，我们的精神还被旧式的思想意识所充塞着，新的教育影响一下不容易钻进来。我们有好些人的精神，认真说，还是有待解放的“台湾”。这样的人在要求无条件的自由、无限制的个人利益、绝对的民主。这样的人，一有机会便从事蠢动，或者一受煽惑便跟着蠢动。在这次右派分子的猖狂进攻中，我们是可以看得清清楚楚的。
    因此，在目前反右派斗争中我们来纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年，在我们知识分子，就应该特别作一番深刻的自我检点。
    我们知识分子对于中国革命和中国建设究竟有了多少贡献呢？特别是请把我们自己来和钢铁战士们比较一下吧。不怕不识货，只怕货比货。这一比，我们应该坦白地承认，我们实在是可怜得很，惭愧得很。
    我并不想一笔抹煞，打击知识分子的积极性；而事实是，一般地说来，我们的消极性实在太严重了。我们实际上是远远跟不上时代的发展，有好些人对这个现象却熟视无睹，还在妄自尊大，满腔不平。我在这里不准备把问题全面铺开，只想就两件事实来表明我们的落后，特别向文艺界的朋友们说一说。
    第一是二万五千里长征。那是多么惊天动地的奇迹！李伯钊同志就这一题材写过一部歌剧。董希文同志曾经跟循长征踪迹去寻求画材，作了不少的小品。这些努力是值得尊敬的。还有，陈其通同志的“万水千山”话剧是写得比较成功并演得比较成功的。此外也还有好些零星的作品，但我总觉得气魄不够，作家的力量似乎被史实的伟大性压倒了。最近我看到军委总政治部摄制的彩色纪录片“在长征的道路上”，摄制得很好，太美了！这是很值得称赞的一部好片子。缺点是风景太美，使人容易忽略掉党的领导人和长征战士们坚苦卓绝的精神，因而也就会不容易体会到长征在中国解放和人类解放史中极其重大的意义。
    但我经常在感觉着奇怪。我们中国也有不少的优秀作家，新的或老的，但为什么总没有人抱着雄心来写出这部长征的史诗呢？或许有人已经在写而是我孤陋寡闻吧，我希望是这样。当然，我也应该谴责我自己。我也是拿笔杆的人，然而我的这枝笔杆远远比不上乌江和大渡河上的篙竿。为了纪念长征，为了纪念人民解放军建军三十周年，我建议作家协会组织一批有志愿并有能力的同志，像摄制“在长征的道路上”那样，分头用笔杆去摄制。最好是订出一个五年计划或十年计划，创造出一部伟大的作品，来纪念人民解放军建军三十五周年或四十周年。我虽然已属于“老人”之流，如果认为我够资格，我也很愿意参加这一工作。
    其次是中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的运动。那也是多么伟大的一个奇迹！我们以绝对劣势的装备把天字第一号的帝国主义打败了。在志愿军和英雄的朝鲜人民军面前真正是使山岳低头、江河让路。同样要感谢军委总政治部，为我们编印出了两部重要的读物——“志愿军英雄传”和“志愿军一日”。关于抗美援朝也有好的纪录片，特别是“上甘岭”。这些，我认为不仅是一般读者和观众的精神粮食，而尤其是文艺作家们的精神粮食。作家们在这儿似乎也显示出了过度的营养不良、精神萎靡。在这一伟大运动中，我们的职业作家的努力是显示得多么不够！或许也有人在埋头创作、苦心结构而为我所不知道的吧，我也希望是这样。
    文艺界中有的朋友对于解放后的文艺情况很不满意。不满意是可以的，但认识却是错误了。他们认为是自由不够、民主不够、个性太受拘束，因此便没有好的作品或伟大作品产生。据我看来，倒恐怕是相反，是自由民主太够，因而个人的努力太放松了。近三十年来，在中国就产生了不少伟大的历史事件，并没有谁限制你——不准写，或写了而不许发表，然而却是一些有写作能力的人多呆在北京或上海徒作壁上观。不肯努力写东西，自然就没有东西，还不忙说伟大不伟大了。这怪得谁呢？据我的看法，文艺界的现况，实在不是民主不够而是集中不够，不是自由太少而是纪律太少，不是个性不能发展而是在社会主义文化建设中发展个性的统一意志没有很好地建立起来，也就是说大家对于马克思列宁主义还没有很好的掌握。因而不少的人临到紧要关头，对于大是大非辨别不清楚，甚至连敌我都混淆起来了。这样怎么能写得出适应时代要求的东西？怎么能够在社会主义建设事业中发挥应有的作用？文艺作家是号称为“灵魂工程师”的，自己的灵魂都还有问题，如何来对于别人的灵魂施以加工？
    我已经说过，我并不想专门指责文艺界，事实是中国的知识界一般都有同样的情形。那就是我们还远远落在时代的后边。中国社会已经树立了社会主义所有制的生产关系，而我们的思想意识跟不上。在社会主义生产关系的基础之上，社会主义意识形态的上层建筑还没有建立起来。这是当前的很大的人民内部矛盾。
    要克服这个矛盾，责任是要更多地落在我们知识分子的肩头上的。我们知识分子要想完成这项责任，在今天不应追求更多的自由而应追求更多的纪律，不应追求更多的民主而应追求更多的集中，要想更好地发展个性，便必须更快地建立为社会主义建设服务的统一意志和共同认识。
  　在我们当前就有很好的模范，那就是党所领导的中国人民解放军。这支大军，在毛泽东旗帜下接受了并不断接受着严格的马克思列宁主义的训练，它的特色是既集中而又民主、既有纪律而又有自由、既有统一意志而又有生龙活虎般的个性发展。中国就因为有了这一支战无不胜的军队，所以能获得人民解放战争的胜利，并能保障革命胜利的成果。
    我们目前的五百万知识分子大军，如果真正被组织得来具有人民解放军那样的精神，我要再说一遍，那在社会主义的文教建设和生产建设事业上是要发挥出多么大的作用呵。因此，我要向决心拥护社会主义、接受党的领导的爱国知识分子们高呼：
    让我们向中国人民解放军看齐！
