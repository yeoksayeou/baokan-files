I fully agree with and endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am extremely delighted and excited by the great achievements of our socialist revolution and socialist construction!

I wholeheartedly thank the Chinese Communist Party for leading the Chinese people to build an unprecedentedly strong and unified New China with high prestige in the international community. I thank the Party for leading us to the possibility of completing and over fulfilling the first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy this year. As an industrialist and businessman, I especially want to thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for using peaceful methods, adopting a policy of unity, criticism, and education, guiding us onto the socialist road, and enabling us to advance towards a bright and happy socialist society together with the people of the whole country.

The Great Achievements of Hubei Province's Construction in Recent Years Are Obvious and Cannot Be Denied

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, China's socialist construction has achieved brilliant results, which is well known and obvious to all. Taking our Hubei Province as an example, in 1953 and 1956, the state invested 60 million yuan to build the magnificent Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Hanjiang Flood Diversion projects, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of millions of people. The world-renowned Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was closed in May this year, turning a chasm into a thoroughfare, fulfilling the people's aspirations for decades. Various projects of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are now under construction, and it will be another huge iron and steel base in our country. At the same time, local construction is also developing rapidly, changing the face of many cities. Not long ago, Hanyang was still a small town with desolate weeds and ancient tombs. In just two or three years, new and spacious roads have been opened, and many new buildings have been completed. How can people not be excited when tall buildings rise from the ground? How can people not associate this with the good leadership of the Communist Party and the superiority of our national system? Of course, there have been some shortcomings in our work in recent years. The work in Hubei Province, like the national situation pointed out in Premier Zhou's report, was sometimes too urgent, the pace was too fast, and more money was used in the construction in 1956, but this cannot negate the great achievements we have already made. Overall, our achievements are great and primary, and the shortcomings are secondary, and some are inevitable.

However, the right-wing elements with ulterior motives have completely negated these obvious facts. They took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to carry out vicious slander and rampant attacks on the Party and the socialist cause. In order to achieve their ambitions, they violated the constitution that they themselves had raised their hands to pass, and openly proposed absurd proposals such as establishing a "Political Design Institute," a "Rehabilitation Committee," and "rotation of power among various parties." What is the purpose of these attempts? It is obvious, but it is a conspiracy to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and restore capitalism in China.

Zhang Naiqi's Reactionary Remarks Are Poison

Among these right-wing elements, I want to especially mention Zhang Naiqi, who has close ties with our industrial and commercial circles. His words and actions, like those of other right-wing elements, are very absurd and insidious. For example, he said that "fixed interest is not exploitation." As long as we industrialists and businessmen think a little about our own history of getting rich, we can distinguish how absurd this is. I know that my own fortune was obtained by exploiting the working class. Now it is returned to its original owner and returned to the working class, which is a matter of course. In order to take care of us capitalists, the people's government allows us to continue to obtain a part of the value created by workers' labor within a certain limit in the form of fixed interest within seven years. What is this if it is not exploitation? However, Zhang Naiqi just doesn't admit it. This kind of intention is very obvious, that is, to deny that there is still exploitation today, to deny that there is still a class relationship between us and the working class today, to deny that there is an essential difference between capitalists and workers, as if the bourgeoisie does not need to be transformed, so as to provoke us to break away from the leadership of the working class and return to the situation of "competing on an equal footing" before the "Five-Anti" movement, so that the capitalist system of exploitation and oppression can be restored in China. The deep poisoning of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks not only undermined the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, but also posed a great danger to our national bourgeoisie itself.

Another fallacy of Zhang Naiqi is that he believes that "the boundary between the public and private sectors should not be emphasized," and that the main thing should be to handle affairs according to the division of responsibilities. He also believes that this is a guarantee for private personnel to have positions and powers. What is this for? Obviously, this is an attempt to lure private parties not to pay attention to the relationship between leadership and being led when getting along with public parties, and to induce private parties to emphasize responsibilities and not respect the leadership of public parties when working.

Are private personnel in joint public-private enterprises all in positions without power as Zhang Naiqi said? Not at all. Taking the Hanchang Chemical Plant that I run as an example, the output value of this plant has more than doubled since it became a joint public-private enterprise, which shows that the change in the nature of the enterprise is beneficial to production, and the leadership of the public side is good. The private deputy director of the factory himself told me that he has positions and powers. When I sometimes go to inspect, I can also see that the private side can not only fully assume its due responsibilities, but also actively meet with the public side with sincerity and there is no estrangement. I believe that there must be many such situations all over the country. How can it be said that emphasizing the boundaries between public and private sectors means that the positions and powers of the private sector are not guaranteed?

Of course, in a few joint public-private enterprises, there are indeed some problems with some private personnel in terms of having positions and powers, but in any case, we must never talk about the positions and powers of the private sector without the leadership of the public sector. That is to say, the positions and powers of private personnel must be obtained under the premise of accepting the leadership of the public sector. I think Zhang Naiqi's statement that emphasizing the boundaries between public and private sectors means that the positions and powers of the private sector are not guaranteed is completely wrong. Chairman Mao taught us industrialists and businessmen to "take the enterprise as a base for self-transformation." If we follow Zhang Naiqi's statement and talk about "positions and powers" without the leadership of the public sector, then how can we transform ourselves in this base?

Another fallacy of Zhang Naiqi is that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." This is because of the greedy exploitation of his bourgeois profit-seeking thought. He even tried to say that the bureaucracy that we often oppose in our work is a product of socialism. This is a vicious slander made by Zhang Naiqi to cover up his conspiracy to restore capitalism against our country's socialist system.

People in Industrial and Commercial Circles Need to Raise Their Vigilance, Strengthen Their Study, and Strengthen Their Transformation

There have been many rebuttals to Zhang Naiqi's other fallacies, so I won't say much here. But we must remind our industrialists and businessmen that because our negative side still exists, although we have embarked on the socialist road, we still feel not very accustomed to the new socialist system. Although we have transformed the relations of production in enterprises, the roots of exploitation have not been completely eradicated, and the idea of ​​exploitation is still very serious, so we are more easily confused by right-wing elements and become their market. What's more, they are also good at using our weaknesses and using their double-dealing methods to us. Therefore, we need to raise our vigilance, strengthen our study, and strengthen our transformation. At present, we must first study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and according to the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, recognize who is the people and who is the enemy. On the one hand, expose the conspiracy of the right-wing elements, recognize the danger of "sweet words," and do not be deceived or fooled by them. On the other hand, we must further draw a clear line between them politically and ideologically, resolutely launch a struggle against all right-wing elements, and transform ourselves and improve ourselves in the struggle. Only in this way can we peacefully transition to socialism and transform ourselves into self-reliant working people.

In his report, Premier Zhou affirmed the achievements of the government's various tasks and pointed out the shortcomings. We sincerely admire this realistic and convincing attitude. As an industrialist and businessman, in order to love the Party and help the Party, we must continue to help the Party to rectify its work with a sincere attitude, and constantly overcome some of the shortcomings and errors in our work.

Premier Zhou has also made a correct and specific analysis of the phenomenon that some private personnel in a few joint public-private enterprises still have positions without powers. If it is caused by the shortcomings of the private personnel themselves, we should strive to transform ourselves, eliminate the estrangement and antagonistic emotions with party members, cadres, and public personnel in the direction indicated by Premier Zhou. If it is caused by party members and public personnel, we should help each other frankly, make criticisms, and hope that the Party and the government will supervise at any time and pay attention to improvement.

    感谢共产党引导我们走上社会主义的道路
    陈经畬的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李先念、薄一波两位副总理、董必武院长、张鼎丞检察长、彭真副委员长的报告，我为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就而感到万分欢欣和兴奋！
    我衷心感谢中国共产党，感谢党领导中国人民建成了一个空前强大和统一的在国际上有着崇高威信的新中国，感谢党领导我们有可能在今年完成和超额完成发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划。作为一个工商业者，我特别要感谢中国共产党和毛主席用和平的方法采取了团结、批评和教育的政策，引导我们走上社会主义的道路，使我们能够和全国人民一起向着光明幸福的社会主义社会前进。
    湖北省几年建设成就巨大有目共睹不能抹煞
    几年来，在党的领导下，我国的社会主义建设事业获得了辉煌成绩，这是人所共知有目共睹的。以我们湖北省来说，一九五三年和一九五六年国家以六千万元的投资修筑规模雄伟的荆江分洪和汉江分洪工程，保障了数百万人民的生命财产的安全；轰动世界的武汉长江大桥已于今年五月间合拢，天崭变通道，人民几十年来的愿望实现了；武汉钢铁公司的各项工程，现在正在兴建，它将是我国又一个巨大的钢铁基地。同时地方的建设也在迅速的发展，使许多城市的面貌改观。汉阳不久以前还是荒草凄凄、古冢累累的小城，仅仅在两三年的时间内，新的宽敞的马路开辟了，许许多多新的建筑物落成了，万丈高楼平地起，怎么能不使人感到兴奋，这怎么能使人不连想到共产党领导的好，和我们国家制度的优越性呢？当然，几年来我们的工作也曾出现了一些缺点，我们湖北省的工作正像周总理报告中指出的全国的情况一样，一九五六年建设事业中有的要求急了一点，步子快了一点，钱多用了一些，但是这丝毫不能抹煞我们所已经取得的巨大成绩。总的看起来，我们的成绩是伟大的、主要的，缺点是次要的，有些也是不可避免的。
    别有用心的右派分子却一笔抹煞了这些有目共睹的事实，他们乘党整风的机会，向党向社会主义事业进行了恶毒的诬蔑和猖狂的进攻。为了使他们的野心得逞，他们竟违犯他们自己举手通过的宪法，公然提出要设立“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“各党派轮流执政”等荒谬绝伦的主张。这些企图的目的何在呢？昭然若揭，不过是阴谋推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻人民民主专政，使资本主义在中国复辟。
    章乃器的反动言论是毒药
    在这些右派分子中我要特别提一提和我们工商界有密切关系的章乃器。他的言论和行动和其他右派分子一样，是十分荒谬的、阴险的。例如他说的“定息不是剥削”，只要我们工商业者稍微想一想自己的发家史，就能辨明这是何等的荒谬。我知道我自己的发家就是靠剥削工人阶级得来的，现在物归原主，交还给工人阶级，实在是天经地义的事，而人民政府为了照顾我们资本家，允许在七年之内，以定息的形式在一定限度内继续取得工人劳动所创造的一部分价值，这不是剥削又是什么呢？可是章乃器偏偏不承认。这种居心是很明显的，就是要否认今天还有剥削，否认今天我们和工人阶级之间还有阶级关系，否认资本家与工人还有本质上的区别，好像资产阶级分子已经不需要改造了，以挑拨脱离工人阶级的领导，要我们再回到“五反”运动以前那种“分庭抗礼”的局面，使资本主义剥削人压迫人的制度在中国复辟。章乃器反动言论毒害之深不仅破坏了国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，而且对于我们民族资产阶级本身更是很大的危险。
    章乃器的另一谬论是他认为“不应强调公方与私方的界限”，主要的应该按着职责分工办事。他还认为这是使私方人员有职有权的保证，这又是为什么呢？很明显这就是企图引诱私方与公方相处时不注意是领导和被领导的关系，诱使私方在工作时强调职责而不尊重公方的领导。
    在公私合营企业中私方人员是不是像章乃器所说的都是有职无权的呢！完全不是。以我办的汉昌化工厂为例，这个厂自从公私合营后产值增加了一倍以上，这说明企业性质转变后对生产是有利的，公方领导是好的，在厂的私方副厂长他自己对我说，他是有职有权的。我有时前往视察也能看到私方不仅能把应有的职责充分担任起来，而且非常积极和公方相见以诚并没有什么隔阂。像这样的情况，我相信在全国各地一定是很多的，怎么能说强调了公私界限私方的有职有权就没有保证了呢？
    当然在少数公私合营企业中，有的私方人员在有职有权方面确实也存在一些问题，但无论如何我们决不应离开公方领导去谈私方的有职有权，这也就是说私方人员有职有权必须在接受公方领导的前提下去获得的。我认为章乃器所谓的强调公私的界限私方的有职有权就没有保证的说法是完全错误的。毛主席教导我们工商业者要“把企业作为自我改造的基地”，如果照章乃器的说法，离开公方领导去谈“有职有权”，那么我们如何在这个基地中改造自己呢？
    章乃器的再一谬论是说“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”这是由于他的资产阶级唯利是图贪得无餍的剥削思想的一面在作祟，他竟企图把我们在工作中经常反对的官僚主义说成是社会主义的产物，这是章乃器为资本主义复辟的阴谋打掩护对我们国家的社会主义制度所作的恶毒诬蔑。
    工商界人士需要提高警惕，加强学习，加强改造
    对于章乃器的其他谬论，各方面驳斥的已很多，这里不多说了。但我们要提醒我们工商业者，由于我们消极的一面还存在，虽然目前已走上了社会主义的道路，但对社会主义新制度还感到不大习惯，我们在企业的生产关系上虽然已经转变了，但剥削根子还没有彻底根除，剥削思想还很严重，所以我们就更容易被右派分子所迷惑，成为他们的市场，何况他们也善于利用我们的弱点，向我们施展他们的两面派手段，因此我们需提高警惕，加强学习，加强改造。目前首先要好好学习毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，按照毛主席指示的六项标准，认清谁是人民谁是敌人。一方面揭穿右派分子的阴谋，认清“甜言蜜语”的危险性，不要受他们的欺骗，不要上他们的当；一方面要进一步和他们在政治上、思想上划清界限，与一切右派分子坚决的展开斗争，在斗争中改造自己，提高自己。这样我们才能和平过渡到社会主义，把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动人民。
    周总理在报告中，对政府各项工作肯定了成绩，提出了缺点，这样实事求是的以理服人的态度我们是衷心钦佩的，作为一个工商业者，为了爱护党、帮助党，我们要继续以至诚的态度帮助党整风，不断克服我们工作中的某些缺点和错误。
    对于少数公私合营企业中有些私方人员目前还存在有职无权的现象，周总理也已作了正确的具体的分析，凡是起因于私方人员本身的缺点，我们应该按照周总理所指示的方向，努力改造自己，消除与党员干部、公方人员的隔阂和对立情绪，凡是起因于党员与公方人员的，我们要开诚布公的互相帮助，提出批评，并希望党和政府随时督促，注意加以改进。
