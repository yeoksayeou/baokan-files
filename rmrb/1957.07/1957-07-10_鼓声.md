Drumbeats
    Yang Muqing

    It's dark. In the cooperative's club, young people excitedly beat the drums. People dance and sing to the rhythm of the drums. The wind, carrying the sounds of everyone's joy, gently blows on the coast of southern China. In the typhoon shelter where the evening tide laps the shore, the fishermen are already asleep.

    At this moment, I think of faraway Malaya. At night, the tops of the coconut trees there are plated with silver moonlight, waves crash on the shore, and drumbeats come from the beautiful Malay village. The drumbeats are low, long, and monotonous, and they beat and beat as if they will never stop.

    The Malays, who believe in Islam, are mostly melancholic. At this time, they love to sit cross-legged under the banana leaves, with their eyes closed, the drumbeats evoking their ancient memories. These memories are painted with the blood and sorrow of the previous generation...

    Occasionally, there are also high-pitched songs mixed in with the drumbeats. But I always feel that the singing is also melancholic and heavy.

    I think of a Malay man with a broken leg who lives behind my house. He is often bare-chested, and under his dirty black sarong, a leg as thin as a bamboo pole is exposed. He rarely speaks, and smokes roll-your-own cigarettes all day long. If he doesn't work hard, what will his wife and two coal-black children eat!

    One day, this silent man got angry, because he could no longer bear the insults of the British foreman, and he stabbed the other party with a sharp rubber tapping knife. The tall British foreman kicked him hard in the chest, and he immediately fell to the ground coughing up blood.

    The tragic death of a poor Malay is insignificant in the eyes of bloodthirsty colonialists. But it broke the heart of that Malay woman. She held her children in her arms and cried desperately. The miserable cries seemed to solidify in the air, suffocating people's breathing.

    When I woke up that night, everything around me was incredibly quiet, only a drizzle was falling quietly. The Malay woman ran to the temple and started beating the drums, and the drumbeats sounded particularly mournful and desperate in the quiet night. As I listened, I wondered why she had to torture herself like this? Could these drums of devout prayer bring her justice and warmth?

    The next day, the Malay woman went mad. She let her hair down and sang loudly, wielding a long parang knife and slashing at anyone she met. The rubber plantation owner shot her, and she fell. Her blood stained the hot earth red.

    That night's drumbeats are unforgettable for me!

    "Drumbeats are hope." Later, a Malayan Communist guerrilla told me this. The drums in the temple that pray for blessings from heaven are really sugar-coated poison! Today, we have turned the drumbeats into a battle horn. When the drumbeats sound, the Malays feel very excited. In the drumbeats, we cross rushing rivers at night, cross dense forests, and march bravely. The drumbeats are making the British colonialists more and more headache. The rails are blown up, and the red-haired devils' barracks and warehouses are rising with towering flames.

    "What a huge sound it would be if all the drums were beaten together! This sound will ignite the flames of revenge, and these flames cannot be extinguished by any colonialist."

    At this moment, I hear again the guerrilla's heroic words, I seem to see his clever, glowing eyes, and I seem to hear the battle drums and joyful songs from the Malayan jungle!

    鼓声
    杨牧青
    天黑了。在合作社俱乐部里，青年们兴冲冲地擂起鼓来。人们随着鼓声跳着，唱着。风，带着大家的欢乐声，轻轻地吹在南中国的海边上。在晚潮拍岸的避风港内，渔人们已沉睡了。
    这时，我想起了遥远的马来亚。夜晚，那里的椰林梢镀上了银色的月光，浪花拍着海岸，鼓声从那美丽的马来村里传来。那鼓声低沉、悠长而单调，他们敲呀敲的，仿佛永不会有停止的时候。
    信奉伊斯兰教的马来人，大都是悒郁的。他们在这时候，爱盘着脚端坐在芭蕉叶下，闭着眼睛，鼓声唤起他们古老的回忆。这回忆涂满了上一辈人的鲜血与哀伤……
    偶尔也有高昂的歌声混在鼓声里。但是我总感到那歌声也是悒郁而沉重的。
    我想起在我的房子后面，住着一个断了腿的马来人。他常年赤裸着上身，污黑的纱笼下，露出一只竹竿儿粗细的腿。他很少说话，成天狠命地抽卷叶烟。天还没亮，他便一拐一拐地去割树胶。不拼命干，他那老婆和两个黑炭似的孩子吃什么呢！
    有一天，这个沉默的人动火了，因为他再受不了英国工头的辱骂，他用尖利的割胶刀向对方刺去。高大的英国工头当胸猛踢一脚，他当即口吐鲜血倒下了。
    一个马来穷人的惨死，在嗜血的殖民者看来，是不值一提的。但，这却伤透了那马来女人的心。她把孩子搂在怀里，绝望地哭着。那凄惨的哭声仿佛凝结在空气里，窒息着人的呼吸。
    那天夜里醒来，四周是无比的静，只有细雨悄悄地落着。那位马来妇女跑到神庙里敲起鼓来，那鼓声在静夜里格外显得哀痛绝望。我一面倾听一面想，她何苦要这样折磨自己呢？难道这虔诚祈祷的鼓声，能替她伸冤，给她带来温饱么？
    第二天，那位马来女人疯了。她散发高歌，挥起长长的巴冷刀逢人便砍。树胶园主人向她开枪，她倒下了。她的鲜血染红了灼热的土地。
    那夜的鼓声，使我终生难忘！
    “鼓声，就是希望。”后来，一个马共的游击队员这样对我说。神庙里祈求上苍降福的鼓，真是包着糖衣的毒药！今天，我们已把鼓声变成战斗的号角。鼓声一响，我们马来人的心里振奋得很。在鼓声中，我们夜渡急流，穿过密林，勇敢地行进。鼓声，愈来愈叫英国殖民者头痛。铁轨炸断了，红毛鬼的兵营、仓库冒起了冲天的火光。
    “把所有的鼓一齐敲起来，该是何等洪大的声响！这声响将燃烧起复仇的烈火，这烈火是任何殖民者扑不灭的。”
    此刻，我的耳边又响起了那位游击队员豪迈的话语，我仿佛看到了他那机灵的发光的眼睛，我似乎听到了那来自马来亚密林中的战斗的鼓声和欢乐的歌唱！
