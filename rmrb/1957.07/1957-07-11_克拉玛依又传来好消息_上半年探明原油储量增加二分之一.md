Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, July 10th: The Karamay Oilfield's drilling operations have achieved brilliant results once again. As a result of drilling operations in the first half of this year, the oilfield area has expanded by another 50% on its original basis, and proven recoverable crude oil reserves have also increased by 50%. By June 30, the mine's workers had overfulfilled the state's drilling, oil testing, and oil production plans for the first half of the year.

In the first half of this year, dozens of drilling rigs of the Karamay Mining Bureau carried out regional exploration in the southeastern part of the oilfield area already explored last year. Among the exploratory wells drilled in these areas, seven that have been completed and tested have gushed crude oil, and one has gushed gas of industrial value. The oil production from these seven exploratory wells has increased the Karamay Oilfield area and recoverable crude oil reserves by 50% on the basis of what was proven last year. Several exploratory wells currently being drilled or about to be completed in the southeastern part of the oilfield have revealed good oil and gas shows and oil-bearing formations during the drilling process.

The good geological data obtained from these exploratory wells in the first half of this year has provided new hope for the oil-bearing prospects in the southeast of the fault zone and has provided a more scientific basis for the direction of exploration in the second half of the year.

During these six months, the drilling workers in the Karamay mining area spent a long and severely cold winter. They persisted in large-scale winter drilling operations in the Gobi Desert at minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius and overcame several level 7 to 10 windstorms in the spring. In June, during the dry season of the Manas River, they encountered difficulties in industrial and domestic water use; however, during these difficult days, the mine workers maintained a full work enthusiasm, overcame many difficulties, and overfulfilled the state drilling plan. Now, the workers are continuing to carry out larger-scale drilling activities with full confidence to expand the oilfield area.

    克拉玛依又传来好消息
    上半年探明原油储量增加二分之一
    新华社克拉玛依10日电　克拉玛依油田钻探工作又获得了辉煌成果。今年上半年钻探工作进行的结果，油田面积在原有基础上又扩大了50％，探明的可采原油储量也增加了50％。到6月30日，矿区职工已超额完成了国家规定的上半年钻井、试油、采油计划。
    今年上半年，克拉玛依矿务局的几十部钻机在去年已经探明的油田面积的东南部进行了区域性的勘探。在这些地区钻凿的探井中，已经完钻并且经过试油的探井，有七口喷出原油，有一口喷出有工业价值的气。这七口探井出油以后，使克拉玛依油田面积和可采原油储量在去年探明的基础上，又增加了50％。在油田东南地区正在钻凿和即将钻完的好几口探井，在钻进过程中发现了良好的油气显示和含油地层。
    今年上半年从这些探井中陆续获得良好的地质资料以后，对断层东南部的含油前途又提供了新的希望，并且使下半年的勘探方向有了更加科学的依据。
    在这半年中，克拉玛依矿区钻探职工度过了漫长而又严寒的冬季。他们在零下三、四十度的戈壁上坚持了大规模的冬季钻探施工，战胜了春季多次七级到十级的大风暴。在6月间玛纳斯河枯水季节中，遇到工业和生活用水的困难；但是在这些困难的日子里，矿区职工一直保持了饱满的工作热情，克服了重重困难，超额完成国家钻探计划。现在，职工们正在满怀信心地继续为扩大油田面积进行着规模更大的钻探活动。
