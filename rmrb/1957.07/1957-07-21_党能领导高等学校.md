The Party Can Lead Universities
Jin Bang, Professor of Shandong Institute of Technology

Some rightist elements oppose socialism, saying that socialism is bad in this way and bad in that way. Is it good to take the socialist road? I will not talk about it from general principles, but only cite a few small examples that I have come into contact with to illustrate.

As everyone knows, in old China, there were many "beggars" in society, and you could encounter people asking you for money everywhere. In 1951, when I returned from the United States and passed through the streets of San Francisco, American "beggars" asked me for money. However, after I arrived in New China, I have not encountered a single person asking me for money in the places I have been to in the past few years. This shows that in the new society of New China, everyone has food and clothing. From this one thing, it is not difficult to distinguish which is better: the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of old China, the capitalist society of the United States, or our socialism.

In 1951, my monthly salary was more than 100 yuan, and now it is nearly 200 yuan, and my living standard has increased by nearly one time. In the first half of last year, I and some representatives of the provincial people's congress and members of the provincial political consultative conference went to Yantai to inspect and saw an advanced agricultural cooperative that produced apples. This cooperative is called the Happiness Cooperative. The cooperative produced nearly 200,000 catties of apples in 1953, nearly 800,000 catties of apples in 1955, and planned to produce 2.46 million catties of apples in 1956, equivalent to twelve times that of 1953. Before liberation, the average yield of Yantai apples per mu was 310 catties. In 1956, the thirty-year-old trees of the Happiness Cooperative had a yield of 9,500 catties per mu. The cooperative plans to increase the yield of apples per mu to 15,000 catties during the second five-year plan period. At that time, the apple yield will be forty-eight times that of 1950. The income situation of the Happiness Cooperative members is: those who work well can earn 1,100 yuan per person per year, an average of 700 yuan per person per year, and the least is 300 yuan. An old lady can also earn 400 yuan a year. The living standards of the Happiness Cooperative members have improved rapidly. Such a good life powerfully illustrates the superiority of socialist society.

I have a cousin who works in Beijing. He has suffered from arthritis for more than a year. After repeated treatment by Western and Chinese medicine, he is now able to work. He recently wrote to me and told me: his illness is cured, his health is good, and his words are full of joy. He also said: If Jin Xuan had that small sore now, he would not have died. (Jin Xuan is my cousin. He worked in Xi'an during the Anti-Japanese War. He had a small sore on his lip, which was not treated well, and he died soon after.) Reading his letter aroused my feelings. In the past three or four years, I have also been suffering from hypertension. I have taken a lot of Chinese and Western medicine, and there is a basket of medicine bottles. I think if my illness had not been treated so conveniently, or if it had been in the old society, I might have died. Now both my cousin and I are alive and able to work, which is entirely thanks to the superior socialist system.

The above three small examples can illustrate the superiority of socialist society and refute the lies and fallacies of the rightist elements who oppose the socialist road.

Some rightist elements propose that the Communist Party should withdraw from universities, arguing that the party members who lead universities do not understand the work and that the party committee does not have the ability to lead universities. I think this argument is completely wrong. May I ask, if the Party does not lead universities, who will lead universities? Some people propose that professors should run the school. May I ask, professors whose minds have not been transformed, professors with a brain full of bourgeois ideas, how much ability do they have to lead our universities? Can they lead universities to take the socialist road? Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China and no socialist society. The relationship between the Party and socialism is like the relationship between the brain and the torso. Only with the leadership of the Party can we ensure that all undertakings advance on the socialist road. Our universities are also part of socialist construction. If we don't want the Party to lead, who else can lead universities to realize the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism? The so-called professors running the school is not difficult to understand, it is to go back to the old road of capitalism.

I think the Party is capable of leading universities. In the past few years, the achievements in the adjustment of departments and disciplines, the establishment of majors, and the reform of teaching in universities have been enormous and obvious to all. This is the best proof that the Party can lead universities. The so-called party members do not understand the work and cannot lead universities is also completely unfounded. Once I had a conversation with a Party leader in our school. When talking about the course of heat transfer, he said that heat transfer is a very important course in the boiler major. I think he was talking like an expert when he said this. Our school does not have a boiler major, but he already has knowledge in this area, which shows that some leaders of our school's Party organization have already learned a lot of things, already understand some professional work, and have extensive professional knowledge. It is unfounded to say that they do not understand the work in general terms. I believe that the Communist Party members who wholeheartedly serve the people and are enthusiastic about higher education will gradually learn to run higher education well, and they will gradually become experts or specialists in running universities like the Communist Party members who work in factories and enterprises. Of course, they understand less when they first enter universities, but through learning and practice, they will gradually improve their professional abilities. In view of this situation, our attitude should be to actively help party cadres understand the work and become familiar with the work, so as to strengthen the Party's leadership in universities. Some people advocate driving party cadres out of universities. I think this is the practice of rightist elements. The Party is an effective guarantee for leading our universities to take the socialist road.

We must stand firm, support the Party, love socialism, and wage a resolute struggle against the bourgeois rightist elements who oppose the Party and oppose socialism.

    党能领导高等学校
    山东工学院教授  金榜
    有些右派分子反对社会主义，说社会主义这不好那不好。走社会主义的道路好不好呢？我不从一般道理上去讲，而只举几个我所接触的小例子来说明。
    大家都知道，在旧中国，社会上的“叫化子”是很多的，到处可以遇到有人向你要钱。1951年我从美国回来，在旧金山街上经过时，就有美国的“叫化子”向我要钱。可是我到新中国后，几年内所到之处，没有遇到一个向我要钱的人，这就表明，在新中国的新社会里，人人都有吃有穿了。从这一件事上，就不难区别旧中国的半封建半殖民地社会、美国的资本主义社会和我们的社会主义哪个好了。
    1951年，我每月的工资是一百多元，现在将近二百元，生活提高将近一倍。去年上半年，我同一部分省人民代表和省政协委员到烟台去视察，看了一个生产苹果的高级社。这个社叫幸福社，该社在1953年全年生产苹果近二十万斤，1955年生产苹果近八十万斤，1956年计划生产苹果二百四十六万斤，相当于1953年的十二倍。在解放前，烟台苹果每亩的平均产量为三百一十斤，1956年幸福社的三十年大树，每亩产量已达九千五百斤，该社准备在第二个五年计划期间将苹果每亩产量提高到一万五千斤；到那时，苹果产量将为1950年的四十八倍。幸福社社员们的收入情况是：劳动好的一年一个人可以有一千一百元，平均一个人每年收入七百元，最少的也有三百元，老大娘一年也可以有四百元的收入。幸福社社员崔启云，去年已七十六岁了，过去曾要过饭，现在他全家三个劳动力，全年收入有二千四百元。幸福社社员们生活的提高是很快的。这样美好的生活，有力地说明了社会主义社会的优越性。
    我有一位表弟在北京工作，他生关节炎病已有一年多，经过西医、中医的反复医治，现在已能办公，最近来信告诉我说：病好了，身体健康了，字里行间充满了愉快的心情。他又说：金铉如果现在生那个小疮，就不会死了。（金铉是我堂弟，抗日战争期间在西安工作，嘴唇上生一小疮，未能很好医治，不久就死去。）读了他的来信，引起了我的感想，在这三、四年内，我也一直患高血压症，中药西药吃了很多，药水瓶子就有一篮子。我想我的病如得不到这样方便的医治，或者是在旧社会里的话，可能我已死去了。现在我和我的表弟都能活着，并且还都能工作，这完全是优越的社会主义社会制度保佑了我们。
    上述三个小例子，就能说明社会主义社会的优越性，驳斥了右派分子反对社会主义道路的谎言谬论。
    有些右派分子提出共产党要退出高等学校，认为领导高等学校的党员同志不懂业务，党委没有能力领导高等学校。我认为这种论调是完全错误的。试问党不领导高等学校，由谁来领导高等学校？有人提出教授来治校。试问思想没有改造好的教授，一脑子资产阶级思想的教授，究竟有多大的能力来领导我们的高等学校？他们能够领导高等学校走社会主义的道路吗？没有共产党，就没有新中国，就没有社会主义社会，党与社会主义的关系是像头脑与躯干一样，有了党的领导才能保证各项事业在社会主义道路上前进。我们高等学校也是社会主义建设的一部分，不要党领导，难道又有谁能领导高等学校实现马克思列宁主义的指导原则？所谓教授治校，不难理解就是要倒回资本主义的旧道路。
    我认为党是有能力领导高等学校的。几年来高等学校的院系调整、专业设置、教学改革的成绩是巨大的，是有目共睹的，这就是党能够领导高等学校的最好的证明。所谓党员同志不懂业务，不能领导高等学校，也是毫无根据的。有一次我与我校一位党的领导同志谈话，谈到传热学这门课程时，他说传热学是锅炉专业中一门很重要的课程。我认为他说这句话，完全是说的内行话。我们学校没有锅炉专业，他已具有这方面的知识，这说明我校党组织有的领导同志已经学了许多东西，已经懂得一些专业业务，且具备了广泛的业务知识，笼统地说他们不懂业务是没有根据的。我相信，全心全意为人民服务、热心于高等教育事业的共产党员同志们，是能够逐渐学会办好高等教育的业务的，他们会和在工厂企业工作的共产党员一样逐渐成为办高等学校的内行或专家。当然，他们刚进高等学校时是懂得少些，但经过学习和实践，是会逐渐提高自己的业务能力的。针对这种情况，我们的态度应该是主动地帮助党员干部了解业务，熟悉业务，以加强党在高等学校的领导。一些人主张把党员干部哄出高等学校，我认为这是右派分子的作法。党是领导我们高等学校走社会主义道路的有效保证。
    我们要站稳立场，拥护党，爱护社会主义，与反对党、反对社会主义的资产阶级右派分子作坚决的斗争。
