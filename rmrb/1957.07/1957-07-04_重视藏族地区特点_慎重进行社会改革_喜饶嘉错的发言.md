Emphasize the Characteristics of Tibetan Areas
Proceed Cautiously with Social Reform
Xi Rao Jia Cuo's Speech
I first express my sincere agreement with and support for Premier Zhou's report and the final accounts, the national economic plan, and the reports of the courts, procuratorates, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I firmly implement them.

Oppose the Rightists' Conspiracy to Restore National Oppression
For more than thirty years since the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, it has endured countless hardships and sacrificed numerous lives to seize power from the reactionary rulers and establish a people's democratic dictatorship. Since the founding of the country eight years ago, the Communist Party has brilliantly completed and is completing various great reforms and construction undertakings, rapidly ending the history of thousands of years of national oppression like light dispelling darkness, and firmly establishing a new relationship of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups in the country deeply know that the Communist Party is a party that is always loyal to the people's cause, and therefore unanimously support the leadership of the Communist Party. This objective fact is not only crystal clear to the people of all ethnic groups in the country but has also been recognized internationally for a long time. When we say that the great achievements have been made and the people's support has been gained due to the Party's leadership, it is not flattery or an attempt to conceal the Party's shortcomings and the contradictions existing between the Party and the people. It is precisely because the Party faces the existing contradictions and shortcomings squarely that the Party has called for rectification and sincerely accepted criticism from people outside the Party. This open and aboveboard style of not covering up diseases or shunning medicine is precisely the great glory of the Communist Party. Only the Communist Party in the world dares to expose its own shortcomings and has the confidence to improve its leadership. This is exactly what the Buddha said, "To err and be able to correct it, that is called a sage." Now, all parts of the country, based on the common goal of improving the Party's leadership and building socialism, are boldly speaking out without reservation and offering well-intentioned criticisms to the Party. Many of these are practical and worthy of the Communist Party's acceptance. However, there are also those who harbor ulterior motives and use the "big blooming" to spread fallacies, some of whom insult and slander the Party, and some fabricate rumors and frame-ups out of thin air, attempting to weaken the Party's leadership and oppose the socialist system, making the "big blooming" forum smoggy for a time. The Buddha taught us: "Do not boast of your own good, do not hide your own evil, praise the good of others, do not praise the evil of others; parents and others have faults, but do not speak of them because of their great kindness," but if it is beneficial criticism, it may be put forward, as for speaking irresponsibly, it is detrimental to both oneself and others. Our country is a large country with hundreds of millions of people, and even if there are many criticisms, it is impossible to easily turn everyone into a saint; conversely, if there is a lack of criticism, it will not allow everyone to recklessly embark on the wrong path. At any time and in any environment, it is very necessary to act in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and use democratic power to defend socialism. Now, the counter-criticism of fallacies by people from all walks of life has appeared in the forum every day. It has won the unanimous support of fair-minded and wise people across the country. For improving the people's ability to distinguish between good and evil, it is like growing a thousand wise eyes of the Emperor Shitian. In the future, people from all walks of life should respond to the Party's call, based on the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, standing on the position of the broad masses of the people, and based on the six criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, constantly offering well-intentioned and fair criticisms to the Communist Party, sincerely and wholeheartedly uniting with the Communist Party, jointly and correctly resolving the contradictions among the people, and further consolidating the Party's leadership and the socialist line. This is the correct attitude that we non-Party members should have in helping the Communist Party to rectify itself. We deeply understand that those fallacies that oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism are conspiracies to drag the people of the whole country back from the happy road of national equality and unity to the path of suffering from national oppression and exploitation. We will not only not be confused by them but also resolutely oppose them.

Social Reform Should Emphasize the Characteristics of Tibetan Buddhism
Now I would like to express some personal opinions on the implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief. We minority nationalities, especially the Tibetan people, have a key issue that cannot be ignored, namely the issue of Buddhism. The Tibetan people, whether monks or laymen, men or women, all believe in Buddhism, and their belief is extremely devout, even to the point of not abandoning Buddhism at the risk of their lives. This requires us to place Buddhism in an important position when carrying out any work in Tibetan areas. At present, Tibetan areas have not yet systematically carried out reforms, and some areas are only in the initial stage. The concept of socialism for Tibetans is: "Happiness and well-being for all beings," which is of course very good, and no one opposes it. To take the road of socialism, it is necessary to go through some necessary reforms, which is also inevitable. How to reform well, only cooperation is good, and many people have also recognized this. This great change, led by the great working class, thoroughly liberates the backward fraternal nationalities, so that they can achieve factual equality. The minority nationalities are grateful for this wholehearted compassion for the fraternal nationalities. However, due to the deep-rooted old ideas of the Tibetan people for thousands of years and the lack of contact with new knowledge, it is undoubtedly more difficult to quickly change from private ownership to public ownership. This is a characteristic that deserves the attention of government leaders. Neglecting these characteristics will turn good things into bad things. The Party has firmly emphasized the "peaceful consultation" approach in the reform cause in ethnic areas, and has completely allowed minority nationalities to decide for themselves on the issues of whether to reform or not, when to reform, and how to reform, and advocates carrying out meticulous publicity and education work for the broad masses of the people and cadres. This is the correct policy put forward after fully paying attention to these characteristics, and it has basically been correctly implemented in ethnic areas. However, there have also been some deviations. Due to the failure of some areas or a small number of cadres to conduct meticulous publicity and education in the implementation, relying on the enthusiasm of some people, and holding subjective wishes to achieve socialism as soon as possible, they adopted simple coercive orders, and even treated people rudely. These also involved Buddhist issues, coupled with the fact that counter-revolutionary elements took the opportunity to provoke and incite in every possible way, adding fuel to the fire, thus causing disturbances and rebellions. This misfortune was not unavoidable, and the reason why it could not be avoided was due to errors in several aspects. In the future, on the one hand, cadres should be further educated to attach importance to ethnic characteristics and Buddhist issues, and to handle problems by combining reform, ethnicity, and Buddhism in a way that does not conflict with each other. On the one hand, in coordination with Tibetan characteristics, extensive and in-depth socialist patriotic education should be launched in a convenient and skillful manner to improve people's understanding. On the other hand, vigilance should be heightened to strictly prevent and expose the destructive conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements. By doing so, we can gradually create the conditions for the socialist transformation of Tibetan areas to come to fruition.

Running Agricultural Cooperatives in Tibetan Agricultural Areas Should Be "Lenient Rather Than Strict"
As far as I can see, there are still several important specific issues that need to be resolved. First, the system for running agricultural cooperatives in Tibetan agricultural areas should be "lenient rather than strict." Because Tibetan people live a leisurely life, in addition to production, there are also Buddhist activities. If the cooperative is too strict, the members will feel very busy and will not be very satisfied. If they are even busier and squeeze out the time for Buddhist activities, they will be even more dissatisfied. Therefore, the degree of tension that is not very adaptable to their lifestyle habits should not be too great. The income of cooperative members should be retained less and distributed more to increase the actual income of each person, so that they can clearly recognize the superiority of socialism and improve their belief in cooperation and the government. When retaining food rations, if no quantitative regulations are made, many unnecessary concerns can be eliminated; if it is necessary to stipulate, efforts should also be made to increase them as much as possible. The quantity of unified purchase should be appropriately reduced, leaving more surplus grain so that they feel free to use it immediately and handily for Buddhist and other reasons, and can reduce the state's purchasing and marketing tasks. The food of some lamas relies on the supply of lay families. Because some cooperatives have not included the lamas in the household in the members' families, the lay families have not been allocated the lamas' food, so they have no grain to supply to the lamas. This point should be properly resolved. There are also some temple lands that have joined the cooperative with the lay families. During the autumn harvest distribution, either because the income has not been distinguished, or because too little has been distributed, they cannot maintain their lives and demand to withdraw the land for self-cultivation, which is not permitted. I think it is a good phenomenon that lamas are willing to engage in production and cultivate their own food. Their requirements should be met, otherwise, they will worry that the number of small lamas will gradually decrease due to living difficulties, thereby causing doubts about the policy of freedom of religious belief. Livestock entering agricultural cooperatives should be based on draft animals in accordance with the policy, and fair prices should be given. For farmers with more cattle and sheep, in addition to draft animals, whether or not to join the cooperative should be up to them voluntarily, and no coercive orders should be given. Doing so can also reduce the deaths caused by lack of care and poor collective feeding.

Trying Out Tibetan Pastoral Cooperatives Should Be "Even More Lenient Rather Than Strict"
Secondly, the pastoral cooperativization of Tibetans is still in the trial stage. It points out a bright road forward for the production of animal husbandry in Tibetan areas and has accumulated some experience. Of course, it is definitely good. But it should be noted that because it is a new thing being tried out, it should be even more cautious. Work should be considered from all aspects. The lives of herdsmen are more leisurely than those of farmers. In addition, the grasslands are vast and the population is sparse, making it easier to make a living. Therefore, running cooperatives should be "even more lenient rather than strict." It is said that some wealthy herdsmen are willing to hand over half of their cattle and sheep, hoping only to let them graze the remaining half themselves. This shows some dissatisfaction. Some poor herdsmen also feel that the work in the cooperative is tense and too far from their habits, sometimes evoking memories of their past leisurely and relaxed lives. These characteristics are all issues that deserve attention.

Furthermore, it is said that the number of newly ordained small lamas is gradually decreasing in some places. Teaching is passed on from person to person, and some people cannot help but worry about the inheritance of Buddhism, and therefore worry about whether the policy of freedom of religious belief will change. This is also very worthy of attention.

There is also a feeling that I think "thrift" and "rationing" are certainly good systems, and they are good ways to build the country through diligence and thrift. We must implement them, but in some places, they should not be too strict. The work of organizing and regulating the supply of materials should be further organized and regulated, and the scale should be appropriately relaxed.

Reduce or Exempt Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Taxes for Temples and Lamas
Finally, there is also a wish that I hope to be able to exempt or reduce the agricultural tax and animal husbandry tax for temples and lamas in agricultural and pastoral areas. I think that doing so will enable us to receive unimaginable effects in both name and reality worldwide. I can let the Buddha prove that my opinion is a sincere and upright opinion based on pure patriotic, religious, and ethnic love.

Please correct me if the above statement is correct.

    重视藏族地区特点
    慎重进行社会改革
    喜饶嘉错的发言
    我首先对周总理的报告和预决算、国民经济计划、法院、检察、人大常委的报告，表示衷心同意和拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    反对右派恢复民族压迫的阴谋
    中国共产党领导中国人民革命事业三十几年以来，受尽了千辛万苦，牺牲了无数生命，才从反动统治者手中夺得了政权，建立了人民民主专政的国家。建国八年以来，共产党卓越地完成了和正在完成着各项伟大的改革和建设事业，像灯光破除黑暗一般地迅速结束了几千年的民族压迫历史，巩固地建立了各民族友好团结的新关系，全国各族人民都深深知道共产党是始终忠实于人民事业的政党，因此一致拥护共产党的领导，这个客观事实，不仅国内各族人民洞若观火，在国际上也是早有定评。我们说由于党的领导取得了伟大的成绩和获得了人民的拥护，并不是阿谀奉迎，有心隐讳党的缺点和存在于党同人民之间的矛盾，正由于党正视了存在着的矛盾和缺点，党才号召整风，并诚恳地接受党外人士的批评。这种不讳疾、不忌医的光明磊落的作风，正是共产党的伟大光荣处，世界上只有共产党才敢于揭露自己的缺点，有信心地改进领导，这正是佛陀所说的“过而能改，是谓圣人”。现在全国各地本着改进党的领导和建设社会主义的共同目标的原则，毫无顾虑地大鸣大放，向党提出了善意的批评，有很多是具有实际意义而值得共产党接受的忠言。但是心怀叵测，假借鸣放大发谬论者亦有之，有的对党采取辱骂侮蔑，有的无中生有造谣中伤，企图削弱党的领导权和反对社会主义制度，使鸣放论坛曾经有一个时期乌烟瘴气。佛陀教导我们：“勿扬己之善，勿隐己之恶，当扬人之善，勿扬人之恶，父母等有过，恩大故不说”，但是如果是有益的批评，也许可提出，至于信口开河，于人于己都是不利的。我国是拥有几亿人口的大国，即使有很多的指摘，也不能轻易把所有的人都变成圣人；反过来说，如果缺乏指摘，也不会让所有的人都毫无忌惮地走入邪途，我们无论在什么时候，在什么环境，照宪法规定办事，用民主政权来捍卫社会主义，是非常必要的。现在各界人士驳斥谬论的反批评，已经天天出现在论坛上了，它获得全国公正明智者一致的拥护，对提高人民辨别善恶的能力来说，就像长出了帝释天王的千只慧眼。今后各界人民，更应响应党的号召，本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，站在广大人民的立场上，依据毛主席提出的六项标准，向共产党不断地提出善意的、公正的批评，诚心诚意地和共产党团结一致，共同正确地解决人民内部的矛盾，进一步巩固党的领导，巩固社会主义路线，这是我们党外人士帮助共产党整风应有的正确态度。我们深深明白：那些反对共产党领导、反对社会主义的谬论，是企图把全国人民从民族平等团结的幸福之路，拖回到民族压迫剥削的苦难之路的阴谋，我们不仅不为所惑，并且坚决反对。
    进行社会改革要重视藏族信奉佛教的特点
    现在我对贯彻宗教信仰自由政策方面，表示一些个人意见。我们少数民族，特别是藏族，有一个不可忽视的关键问题，即佛教问题。藏族人民无论僧俗男女都一致信奉佛教，而且信仰极为虔诚，那怕在性命关头上也不放弃佛教，这就要求我们在藏族地区进行任何工作时，要把佛教摆在重要的地位上来考虑问题，现在藏族地区还没有系统地进行改革，有的地区才在开步走的阶段。藏民对社会主义一语的概念是：“一切众生、幸福安乐”，这当然是很好的，谁也不反对。要走社会主义的道路，就要经过一些必要的改革，这也是必然的。怎样改才好，只有合作化好，也是很多人都认识了的。这个伟大的变革，由伟大的工人阶级来领导，彻底解放落后的兄弟民族，使之达到事实上的平等，这种全心全意为兄弟民族的慈悲心肠，少数民族是五体投地的感激的。但是由于藏族几千年来的旧思想根深蒂固，对新的知识又接触得不多，因此要从私有制很快地改变为公有制，不用说是比较困难的，这就是值得政府领导注意的特点，忽视了这些特点，就会把好事办成坏事。党在民族地区的改革事业上，坚决强调“和平协商”方式，在改与不改，什么时候改，如何改的问题上，完全让少数民族自己去决定，并主张对广大人民群众及干部，进行细致的宣传教育工作，这就是充分注意了这些特点后而提出的正确方针，并已于民族地区基本上获得了正确贯彻。但也不是没有发生过偏缺，由于在执行中某些地区或少数干部未经过细致的宣传教育，凭着一部分人的热情，对社会主义抱着急于求成的主观愿望，而采取了简单的强迫命令，甚至粗暴对待，这些又或涉及了佛教问题，再加上反革命分子乘隙千方百计地挑拨煽动，在大火上加汽油，于是引起骚动叛乱。这种不幸并不是不可以避免的，其所以未能避免是由于几方面的错误造成的。今后一方面应进一步的教育干部重视民族特点和佛教问题，把改革与民族、佛教三者互不相违地结合起来处理问题。一方面应配合藏族特点，方便善巧的展开广泛而深入的社会主义的爱国教育，以提高人民认识。另一方面还要提高警惕，严密防范和揭发反革命分子的破坏阴谋，这样做，才能逐步为藏族地区的社会主义改造创造瓜熟蒂落的条件。
    在藏民农业区办社“宜宽不宜紧”
    管见所及，目前尚需解决几件重要的具体问题。第一在藏民农业区办社，制度上“宜宽不宜紧”。由于藏民生活闲散，除生产外，还有佛教活动，如果社抓得太紧了，社员感到忙得很，就不大满意，如果更忙得挤掉了佛教活动时间，就会更不满意，因此与他们生活习惯不十分适应的紧张程度，是不宜太大的。社员的收入，应少留多分，增加每人的实际收入，使之显明地认识社会主义的优越性，以提高其对合作化和政府的信仰。在留口粮时，如果不作定量规定，可以消除许多不必要的顾虑；如果必须规定，亦应设法尽量提高。统购数量，应适当减少，留给较多的余粮，使其在佛教和其他原因的支付上感到自由即时、得心应手，并可减轻国家购销的任务。有一部分喇嘛的食粮，素靠俗家供给，由于个别社未把社员家中的喇嘛计算在户口内，俗家没有分到喇嘛的口粮，因之没有粮供给喇嘛，这点应妥为解决。还有一些寺院僧田，随俗家入了社，秋收分配时，或由于没有分别收益，或分得太少，不能维持生活，要求抽回土地自种，得不到许可。我看喇嘛愿意进行生产自耕自食，是很好的现象，应该满足他们的要求，不然将使他们顾虑由于生活困难小喇嘛将会逐渐减少，从而引起对宗教信仰自由政策的怀疑。农业社牲畜入社，应照政策以耕畜为主，并应公平给价，对牛羊较多的农户，除耕畜外，入社与否，听其自愿，不得强迫命令，这样做，还可减少由于不关心和不善于集体饲养而引起的死亡损失。
    试办藏民牧业合作社更应“宁宽勿紧”
    其次藏民牧业合作化尚在试办阶段，它给藏区牧畜业生产指出一条前进的光明大路，并积累了一些经验，当然肯定是好的。但应该注意的是：因为它是试办的新事物，就更应该谨慎将事，工作应从各方面去考虑。牧民生活较农民更为闲散，加以草原广阔，人口稀少，谋生较易，因此办社更应“宁宽勿紧”。听说个别富裕牧民愿意把一半牛羊交出来，只希望让他自己放牧剩下的一半，这多少表现出了一些不满情绪。也有个别贫苦牧民，感到社内工作紧张，同他的习惯距离太大，有时勾起他过去闲散轻松生活的回忆，这些特点，都是值得注意的问题。
    复次听说有些地方新出家的小喇嘛逐渐在减少，教以人传，有些人不免为佛教的继承担心，因而顾虑宗教信仰自由政策是否会变，这也是很值得注意的。
  还有一个感觉，我觉得“节约”“定量”当然是好制度，是勤俭建国的好办法，我们一定贯彻执行，但在某些地方不宜失之过严，应更进一步组织和调节物资供应工作，适当地放宽尺度。
    减免寺院和喇嘛的农牧业税
    最后还有一个愿望，希望能够免除或者减轻农业区和牧业区的寺院和喇嘛的农业税和牧业税，我想这样做将使我们在世界范围内名实两方面都能收到不可思议的效果。我可以让佛陀证明我的意见是出发纯洁的爱国、爱教、爱民族的忠直的意见。
    以上发言，是否正确，请各位代表指正。
