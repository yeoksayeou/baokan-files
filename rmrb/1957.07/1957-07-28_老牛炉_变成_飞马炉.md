    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 25th. At 9:50 this morning, the No. 7 open hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, after being rebuilt, produced its first batch of molten steel. With this, the reconstruction project of the open hearth furnaces of the No. 1 Steel Plant has been fully completed.
    An excited steelworker from the No. 7 open hearth furnace told Xinhua reporters that our "Old Ox Furnace" has become a "Flying Horse Furnace." He said that the time it takes to refine a furnace of steel is now more than two hours shorter than before the reconstruction, so it can produce more than 70,000 tons of steel for the country each year.
    The No. 1 Steel Plant, rebuilt with advanced new equipment replacing outdated production equipment, will produce nearly twice as much steel for the country this year as it did in 1952.

    “老牛炉”变成“飞马炉”
    据新华社鞍山25日电　今天上午九时五十分，鞍钢第一炼钢厂改建完成的七号平炉，出了第一炉钢水。至此，第一炼钢厂的平炉改建工程已经全部完成。
    一位七号平炉的炼钢工人兴奋地告诉新华社记者，我们的“老牛炉”变成“飞马炉”了。他说，现在炼一炉钢的时间，要比改建以前缩短两个多小时，所以它每年能为国家多生产七万多吨钢。
    用先进的新设备代替落后的生产设备改建起来的第一炼钢厂，今年全年为国家生产的钢，将比1952年增长将近一倍。
