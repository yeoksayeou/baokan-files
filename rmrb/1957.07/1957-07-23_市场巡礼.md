    Market Roundup
    Shatian Pomelos
    On the pomelo trees in Shatian Township, Rong County, Guangxi, are now full of hanging fruits, the large ones weighing more than ten taels, and the small ones half a catty. People passing by say they are lovely. Local old farmers also say: This year the pomelo blossoms bloomed early and abundantly, and the rainfall was well-distributed, ensuring a good harvest. ·Xinhua News Agency·
  Turpan Grapes and Hami Melons
    Seedless white grapes and Hami melons from Turpan, Xinjiang, are beginning to hit the market.
    Although the grapes are not yet fully ripe, and still have a hint of sourness in their sweetness, they are very popular with consumers. These days, at fruit stands on street corners and along the roadside vending carts, people are constantly gathering to buy and taste these fresh fruits. ·Xinhua News Agency·
    Guangxi Pineapples
    In the height of summer in July, in Xiahuang Township, Wuming County, one of the main pineapple producing areas in Guangxi Province, members of agricultural cooperatives are busy picking ripe fruits in the pineapple fields. The pineapples, green with a hint of yellow, exude a fragrant aroma in the wind, making one's mouth water.
    Loads of pineapples that are harvested are immediately carried by the cooperative members to the market for sale. Some have already been purchased by the local commercial system and transported to Wuhan, Beijing, and other places for sale.
    Pineapples are one of the main sources of income for the members of the Xiahuang Township agricultural cooperative. Almost every one of the 467 Zhuang ethnic households in the township grows them, and they have a history of planting for twenty years. This year, the township's 1,007 mu of pineapples will yield 200,000 jin, an 8% increase over last year. Most farmers earn an average of several dozen to more than one hundred and fifty yuan per year. Poor peasant Huang Hanchang opened four mu of wasteland to grow pineapples, and his annual income is equivalent to more than 2,000 jin of grain, accounting for 70% of his total agricultural income.
    Xiahuang Township has many barren hills and ridges with red soil, which are suitable for growing pineapples. After the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives last spring, the originally divided pineapple fields were connected into a large area. In just over a year, the township has expanded the pineapple planting area by more than one hundred mu. ·Xinhua News Agency·
    Fenghua Honey Peaches
    The famous Zhejiang Fenghua honey peaches are ripe. In the peach orchards, heavy fruits hang from the branches, and fruit farmers are beginning to pick them.
    There are many varieties of Fenghua honey peaches, among which the most famous are Yulu, Huanglu, and Pantao. The fully ripe Yulu peach is fresh, sweet, and juicy. When eating it, there is no need to peel the skin; a wheat straw can be inserted into the skin to suck out the juice, leaving only the skin and the pit.

  Yantai Apples and Dezhou Watermelons
    The famous Shandong Yantai apples and Dezhou watermelons have both had bumper harvests this year. Now is the season for early-maturing apples and watermelons to be on the market in large quantities, and these apples and watermelons are being transported out in large quantities.
    This year, Shandong Province's supply of early-maturing apples to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities has exceeded the original plan. The total supply of watermelons to other provinces will reach 15 million jin. ·Xinhua News Agency·
  Liaoning Apples Shipped to Moscow
  For World Youth Festival Attendees to Sample
    The first batch of 850 tons of Liaoning's famous early-maturing apples were shipped to the Soviet Union starting July 15th, and will all arrive by the end of July. Among them, 57 tons are transported to Moscow in refrigerated cars, for the participants of the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival to sample.
    These exported early-maturing apples are of the Huangkui and Hongkui varieties, produced in Gaiping and Fuxian counties, the main apple producing areas of Liaoning Province. Each apple is 45 to 50 millimeters in diameter, with an average of five to seven apples per jin. Before export, the apple production cooperative members undergo repeated selection and inspection to ensure that they fully meet the quality and specification standards for exported apples. ·Wen·
    Liaoning Province's early-maturing apples (Huangkui, Hongkui) have been on the market since July 10th. The four purchasing stations in the apple-producing areas of Gaiping, Fuxian, Xinjin, and Luda have purchased more than 500,000 jin in two days. This year, due to the drought, the apples are smaller in size, but the taste is still good. The first truckload of apples was shipped to Shenyang City on July 11th, and will continue to be shipped to Beijing soon.

    市场巡礼
    沙田柚子
    广西容县沙田乡的柚子树上，现正挂满了一个个下垂的果实，大的有十多两重，小的也有半斤，过往的人见了都说可爱。当地的老农也讲：今年柚子花早花多，雨水调和，丰收是把准了。　·新华社·
  吐鲁番葡萄和哈密瓜
    新疆吐鲁番无核白葡萄和哈密瓜开始上市。
    虽然葡萄还未透熟，甜中还带酸味，但是很受消费者的欢迎。这几天，在街头巷口的瓜果摊边，沿街推卖的流动瓜果车旁，不断围着购尝鲜货的人们。　·新华社·
    广西菠萝
    7月盛夏，在广西省菠萝主要产区之一的武鸣县夏黄乡，农业社社员们正忙着在菠萝园里采摘成熟了的果实。那些绿中泛黄的菠萝，迎风散出阵阵芳香，使人垂涎欲滴。
    收摘下来的一担担菠萝，马上由社员们挑到市场出售。有些已由当地商业系统收购，运销到武汉、北京等地。
    菠萝是夏黄乡农业社社员们的主要收入之一。全乡四百六十七户僮族农民，几乎家家种植，并且已有二十年的种植历史。今年全乡一千零七亩菠萝，产量将达到二十万斤，比去年增产8％。大部分农户平均每年收入几十元到一百五十多元。贫农黄汉昌开了四亩荒地种植菠萝，每年收入折谷二千多斤，占农业总收入70％。
    夏黄乡红土壤的荒山荒岭很多，适宜于种植菠萝。去年春天建立高级农业社后，原来分割成一块块的菠萝地连成一大片了。一年多之间，全乡已扩大菠萝种植面积一百多亩。　·新华社·
    奉化水蜜桃
    著名的浙江奉化水蜜桃已经成熟。桃园里沉甸甸的果实垂满枝头，果农们正在开始采摘。
    奉化水蜜桃的品种很多，其中最著名的是玉露、黄露、蟠桃等数种。透熟的玉露桃，鲜甜多汁，吃时不必剥皮，用麦杆插入皮内就可以吸吮，最后仅剩皮和核。
