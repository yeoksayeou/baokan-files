I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Deputy Premier Li, Deputy Premier Bo, Chief Procurator Zhang, President Dong, and Deputy Chairman Peng.

I am an industrialist and businessman. Now, I would like to express my opinion on the absurd remarks made by Tianjin representative Bi Mingqi during the Party's rectification campaign.

Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi Chime in and Echo Each Other, Completely in Tune

During the Party's rectification campaign, Bi Mingqi, taking advantage of the opportunity to offer suggestions to the Party, made a series of absurd remarks opposing the leadership of the working class and opposing socialist transformation. These remarks echoed and resonated with Zhang Naiqi's. Although he repeatedly denied in group meetings that he was like Zhang Naiqi, the facts are the best answer. Zhang Naiqi said: The Chinese national bourgeoisie is "red bourgeoisie." Bi Mingqi said: "The Chinese national bourgeoisie is great." Zhang Naiqi said: Capitalists have already passed "five tests." If they still have to undergo transformation, it will only increase the endless worries of the industrial and commercial circles. Bi Mingqi said: Capitalists leaped into socialism like agile carp jumping over the Dragon Gate, but they did not expect to still wear this class hat, class relations are still so emphasized, and the duality is still so serious. Zhang Naiqi said: After the overall joint state-private ownership, the duality of industrialists and businessmen has disappeared. Bi Mingqi proposed: After the bourgeoisie handed over the means of production, the transformation of the bourgeoisie is not a basic victory, but a complete victory. If we still say that class relations exist and duality exists without analysis, then that is a dogmatic approach. Zhang Naiqi said: "In joint state-private enterprises, it is not appropriate to emphasize the boundaries between the public and private sectors, nor is it appropriate to emphasize the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. Otherwise, having a position and authority cannot be guaranteed, and the relationship cannot be good." Bi Mingqi said: The government agencies and Party and government cadres in enterprises should bear greater responsibility for the inferiority complex of the bourgeoisie, "To eliminate inferiority complex, we should first eliminate class." Zhang Naiqi said: There is no essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class. Bi Mingqi said: "The status of capitalists and workers in the production system today is no different. The only difference is that workers do not have fixed interest, and capitalists have fixed interest." Zhang Naiqi advocated that during the rectification campaign, it is perfectly acceptable not to mention the advantages, but only the shortcomings. Bi Mingqi also said: "Don't always have achievements and shortcomings. This summary method is a summary method that fosters bureaucracy." Zhang Naiqi said: He became the Minister of Food through struggle, having both position and authority. Bi Mingqi also believed that he became the Vice Mayor of Tianjin and the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce through competition.

Anyone who sees the above comparison cannot but admit how neat and tidy the chorus of Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi is. How similar are their ideological features. In the face of these facts, who can say that Bi Mingqi is not a strong supporter and loyal peddler of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary fallacies?

Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi are so alike. When the two talked about each other's speeches and articles in the CPPCC Cultural Club, they couldn't help but praise each other. Bi Mingqi said: After reading your article, I felt very good. Zhang Naiqi said: "Your article is also very good. You should continue to write like this, don't be afraid!" Bi Mingqi immediately expressed that he would learn from Zhang Naiqi. Zhang Naiqi laughed. On the evening of May 31, Zhang Naiqi said at the symposium of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association: I agree with Bi Mingqi's speech. On the evening of June 2, Meng Yuqing read the record of Zhang Naiqi's speech on May 31 to Bi Mingqi. Bi Mingqi praised it very much, saying that he felt very comfortable after hearing it, and said: "Zhang Naiqi is the one who truly represents the industrial and commercial circles. He has a lot of support. You should support him when you have the opportunity." Bi Mingqi not only praised Zhang Naiqi, but he also did not forget to praise himself. After making a lot of fallacies at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, he said to his confidants: "Among the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles, I am probably the only one who can make such a long speech and dare to speak!" Look at how arrogant these two are, feeling that the heroes of the world today are only Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi.

Bi Mingqi not only praised Zhang Naiqi, but also protected Zhang Naiqi. When the China National Democratic Construction Association criticized Zhang Naiqi last year, Bi Mingqi tried to defend him everywhere. He said to Wang Zhizhou in Tianjin: "Zhang Naiqi is one of the Seven Gentlemen. His theory is higher than ours. Don't join the bandwagon." When Zhang Naiqi was criticized and resisted inspection, Bi Mingqi once said to me: Zhang Naiqi did not invite me to dinner. If he invited me to dinner, I would definitely give him ideas, and the masses would be satisfied with a public review. This year, when Zhang Naiqi said that the term "transformation" was not applicable, someone wanted to criticize him. Bi Mingqi persuaded: Forget it, don't criticize him. It is certainly not accidental that Bi Mingqi so loyally protects Zhang Naiqi.

Exaggerating the Progressiveness of the Bourgeoisie, Attempting to Mix into the Ranks of the Working Class, and Usurp Leadership

What is the purpose of Bi Mingqi's publishing these fallacies? He believes that the estimate of the bourgeoisie is a fundamental issue in all issues. Because the estimate of the bourgeoisie is closely related to the Party's policy. Changing the Party's estimate of the bourgeoisie may change the Party's policy towards the bourgeoisie. Therefore, he worked hard on this issue, trying to shake the Party's policy of transforming the bourgeoisie through this debate. He fantasized about making certain changes in the Party's policy that would be beneficial to the backwardness of the bourgeoisie, so as to facilitate his usurpation of the leadership of the working class. On this issue, the path taken by Bi Mingqi is as follows:

First, exaggerate the particularity of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, and exaggerate the progressive side of the national bourgeoisie. Criticize the Party for underestimating them, not giving them the due status and power, and strive for higher status and greater power.

Second, emphasize that the bourgeoisie has been transformed almost like the working class, and refuse further transformation. Strive to blur the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, so as to mix into the ranks of the working class and take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters.

Third, after he mixes into the ranks of the working class and obtains higher status and greater power, he will inevitably usurp the leadership of the working class, so as to transform the world according to the bourgeoisie's appearance and restore capitalism.

Regardless of whether Bi Mingqi is conscious or unconscious, his deep-rooted bourgeois ideology is dominating him to take such a dead end. Bi Mingqi enjoys such preferential treatment from the working class today and has obtained such a high position, but he is not satisfied. He also demands higher status and power. He is active and willing to work, which is good. However, he is proud and complacent because of this. He feels that his contribution is great, his progress is fast, and his talent is strong, but the Party and the government have not given him the rewards he deserves. He is therefore dissatisfied with the Party. He seizes every opportunity and uses every means to compete for power and climb up. In this regard, he showed a greedy ambition. Although Bi Mingqi does not want people to emphasize duality, this is the most blatant reflection of the negative side of bourgeois duality. When the means of production are still in the hands of the bourgeoisie, their class nature is manifested as being profit-oriented. When the means of production have been handed over, in addition to taking fixed interest as required, they cannot exploit as they please, they are not reconciled, so their bourgeois ideology is manifested as competing for position and power. This problem is particularly obvious in Bi Mingqi. In the past, he worked hard to get rich. Now, he is struggling to get promoted. He himself once said that after the publication of the general line, his desire for fame and fortune rose again. When Tianjin arranged for him to be the deputy mayor, he said to people: He had considered it two or three years ago, but it was only a matter of time. Last year, when Tianjin's China National Democratic Construction Association was re-elected, he demanded that he be the chairman of both the Tianjin China National Democratic Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. In order to achieve his goal, he did not hesitate to engage in small groups, win over people, and promise official positions. He also threatened to bring more than 500 capitalists in the import and export industry into the China National Democratic Construction Association to increase his power. Bi Mingqi also fully demonstrated his domineering and monopolistic nature in the competition for power. He couldn't wait to overthrow all other "opponents," and everything was handled by himself, and all the credit was attributed to himself, so all the honors, status, and interests given by the Party were monopolized by himself. This is a clear reflection of the monopoly nature of the big bourgeoisie.

Bi Mingqi is in such a position, and there is still one place that cannot be satisfied, that is, he cannot do whatever he wants, and cannot lead according to his own bourgeois ideological appearance. He couldn't wait to take the "order flag" from the working class. He believes that the reason why he cannot get the "order flag" is that he is still wearing the hat of the bourgeoisie, and some people are still clinging to duality and class relations. However, in order to remove the hat of the bourgeoisie, he does not work hard to transform his own thinking, but exaggerates the progressiveness of the bourgeois elements, conceals their backwardness, and hopes to blur the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, so as to mix into the ranks of the working class. After mixing into the ranks of the working class, what does he want to do? He confessed in his self-criticism: "After becoming a member of the working class, I can obtain the right to speak... The ultimate goal is to obtain the leadership of my work in the working class." Strange! Does Bi Mingqi not have the right to speak and the leadership of his work now? Bi Mingqi is a representative of the National People's Congress, the Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, the Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, holding several important positions. He not only has the right to speak, but also has the leadership of his work. Not long ago, Bi Mingqi gave so many speeches at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and so many newspapers published them. Then, what kind of right to speak and leadership of his work does he want to obtain? It turns out that what he demands is the right to speak and the leadership of his work to transform the world according to the appearance of the bourgeoisie. They are not satisfied with the right to speak and the leadership of their work under the leadership of the working class. They always feel out of place and cannot do whatever they want, and cannot handle things in their own way. They will never get this satisfaction. Because to satisfy them, only capitalist restoration is possible. This is resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country!

Bi Mingqi always said that his motive for publishing these fallacies was well-intentioned and came from good wishes. What is the real situation? Let's see his own confession in the group meeting. He said in the group meeting: "When I disseminated these fallacies, I wrongly believed that this represented the legitimate interests of the bourgeoisie, which would further increase my prestige in the industrial and commercial circles and gain more supporters." He really represents the "interests" of the bourgeoisie. What kind of "interests" does he represent? He represents the reactionary and regressive "interests" of the bourgeoisie. He represents the "interests" of the bourgeoisie to beautify themselves, look down on the working class, and be unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history. He represents the "interests" of the bourgeoisie who are not satisfied with their current position, resist socialist transformation, and resist the leadership of the Party. He attempted to stir up the dissatisfaction of the bourgeoisie, organize the class ranks to attack the Party, and achieve his own despicable and shameful personal goals from this attack. This is Bi Mingqi's motive. This is the true face of Bi Mingqi's saying "when the critical moment comes, the tail will be exposed."

Industrialists and Businessmen Should Face Reality, Face Themselves, and Strive for Self-Transformation

Bi Mingqi's thinking has sounded a loud alarm for our industrial and commercial circles. Although Bi Mingqi said that he has been transformed almost, his bourgeois thinking is still so serious. Although we have made some progress, many people still feel comfortable listening to the speeches of Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi. This shows that there are still some things in our thinking that resonate with them. His remarks have fueled the pride and complacency of our industrialists and businessmen, and aroused our dissatisfaction with the current status, with continuing to carry out transformation, and with the leadership of the Party. It not only hinders us from continuing to carry out transformation, but also makes us make serious mistakes.

As an industrialist and businessman, I can sincerely say that the Party has done its best to peacefully transform our bourgeoisie. In the past eight years, the Party and the People's Government have worked hard and steadily transitioned us to socialism step by step. When private enterprises encountered difficulties in 1950, the Party launched the working class to help us overcome the difficulties. Before the overall joint state-private ownership, we also adopted the policy of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, including enterprises and people as a whole, so that many of our industrialists and businessmen were spared from elimination and bankruptcy. After the overall joint state-private ownership, we were given fixed interest, we were given jobs, and we were given political status. Many of our colleagues, who were originally just the directors of small factories, are now the directors or deputy directors of large factories. Some who originally only managed one enterprise are now the managers or deputy managers of a company, managing a dozen or dozens of enterprises. Some people have also been arranged as deputy mayors, deputy directors, deputy district heads, and so on. Such arrangements were unimaginable for us in the old society. These jobs are underemployment for us, not overqualified. Many communists who were born and died in revolutionary wars, whose talents, virtues, and merits are much higher than ours, are in positions below us. If we really have a little heart, can we not feel grateful and ashamed for the selfless spirit of the working class? We are born today, to have life, to have work, to have a position, there is no risk anymore. Is there such a happy bourgeoisie in the world? What has the Communist Party done wrong to us? If we do not adhere to the bourgeois standpoint and viewpoint, what reason do we have to be proud and complacent? What reason do we have to be dissatisfied with the position we are in today? And what reason do we have to be dissatisfied with the leadership of the Party?

In the high tide of socialist transformation, our industrialists and businessmen once shouted a loud slogan: "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the road of socialism." This is the only bright future for our industrialists and businessmen. Anyone who tries to take other roads, the facts prove that they will be bruised and battered. We must face reality, face ourselves, honestly obey the leadership of the working class, earnestly carry out transformation, improve our understanding and professional level in labor, and work diligently to serve the people. This is the broad road for industrialists and businessmen.

### 毕鸣岐同章乃器臭味相投  王光英的发言

专栏：

    毕鸣岐同章乃器臭味相投
    王光英的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长的报告。
    我是一个工商业者，现在我仅就天津市毕鸣岐代表在党的整风期间发表的荒谬言论，表示一点意见。
    毕鸣岐和章乃器一唱一和，完全同调
    毕鸣岐在党的整风期间，利用向党提意见的机会，发表了一系列反对工人阶级领导、反对社会主义改造的荒谬言论。这些言论和章乃器是一唱一和，完全同调的。尽管他曾经在小组会上一再矢口否认他和章乃器一样。但是，事实是最好的答复。章乃器说：中国民族资产阶级是“红色的资产阶级”。毕鸣岐就说：“中国的民族资产阶级是伟大的。”章乃器说：资本家已经过了“五关”，如果还要脱胎换骨，只能使工商界增加无穷的忧虑。毕鸣岐就说：资本家以矫健的鲤鱼跳龙门式跳入了社会主义，没想到这顶阶级帽子还戴着，阶级关系还那么强调着，两面性还那么原封不动地严重。章乃器说：在全行业合营以后，工商业家的两面性已经一去不复返了。毕鸣岐就提出：资产阶级把生产资料交出以后，对资产阶级的改造不是基本胜利，而是完全胜利，如果这时还不加分析地说阶级关系存在，两面性就存在，那就是教条主义的方式。章乃器说：“合营企业中，不宜强调公方与私方的界限，也不宜强调党与非党的关系，否则，有职有权，是无法保证的，共事关系也是不可能搞好的。”毕鸣岐就说：资产阶级的自卑感应由政府机关和企业中的党政干部负更大责任”，“要消灭自卑感，首先应当消灭阶级”。章乃器说：资产阶级的分子和工人阶级的分子没有本质的区别。毕鸣岐就说：“资本家和工人今天在生产体系中的地位是没有什么区别的。唯一的区别就是工人没有定息，资本家有定息。”章乃器主张整风的时候完全可以不提优点，只提缺点。毕鸣岐也说：“不要总是有成绩，有缺点。这个总结方法是养成官僚主义的总结方法。”章乃器说：他当粮食部长，有职有权是斗争来的。毕鸣岐也认为他当天津市的副市长和全国工商联的副主委是争出来的。
    任何人，看了以上的对照，都不能不承认章乃器和毕鸣岐的合唱是何等整齐。他们的思想面貌是多么相似。在这些事实面前，谁能说毕鸣岐不是章乃器反动谬论的有力支持者和忠实的贩卖者呢？
    毕鸣岐和章乃器是这样地臭味相投，当两人在政协文化俱乐部一块谈起彼此的发言和文章，情不自禁地互相吹捧起来。毕鸣岐说：看了你的文章，感到很好。章乃器说：“你的文章也很好，你要照样写下去，不要怕！”毕鸣岐立即表示要向章乃器好好学习。章乃器哈哈大笑。五月三十一日晚，章乃器在民建中央工商辅导座谈会上讲话，一开始就说，我同意毕鸣岐的发言。六月二日晚上，孟羽卿把章乃器五月三十一日的讲话记录念给毕鸣岐听，毕鸣岐非常称赞，说他听了感到很舒服，并且说：“真正代表工商界说话的就是章乃器，他很有群众，你们有机会要支持他。”毕鸣岐不仅捧章乃器，他也不忘记捧他自己。他在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上大发谬论之后，对他的亲信说：“工商界的代表人物中，能如此长篇大论，敢于发言的人恐怕只有我一个人吧！”看看这两人是如何的狂妄，大有当今天下英雄唯章乃器与毕鸣岐二人而已之感。
    毕鸣岐不仅捧章乃器，而且保护章乃器。当去年民建批判章乃器的时候，毕鸣岐在下面处处为他解围。他给天津的王芷洲说：“章乃器是七君子之一，理论比我们高，你不要瞎起哄。”当章乃器受到批判，抗拒检查的时候，毕鸣岐曾经对我说：章乃器他不请我吃饭，要是请我吃饭，我一定给他出主意，当众检讨一番群众满意就过去了。今年当章乃器说“脱胎换骨”的提法不适用的时候，有人要批判，毕鸣岐就劝解说：算了，别批判了。毕鸣岐如此忠心地保护章乃器当然不是偶然的。
    夸大资产阶级的进步性，企图混入工人阶级队伍，篡夺领导权
    毕鸣岐发表这些谬论的目的是什么呢？他认为：在各项问题中，对资产阶级的估计是一个根本性的问题。因为对资产阶级的估计是和党的政策有密切联系的。改变了党对资产阶级的估计，就有可能改变党对待资产阶级的政策。因此，他拚命在这个问题上做文章，力图通过这次争论，来动摇党对资产阶级改造的政策。幻想使党的政策作某种有利于资产阶级落后性的改变，以利于他篡夺工人阶级的领导权。在这个问题上，毕鸣岐所走的路线是这样的：
    第一、夸大中国民族资产阶级的特殊性，夸大民族资产阶级的进步一面。批评党低估了他们，没有给他们应有的地位和权力，力图争得更高的地位和更大的权力。
    第二、强调资产阶级改造得已经和工人阶级差不多，拒绝进一步改造。力图模糊工人阶级和资产阶级之间的思想界限，以便混入工人阶级的队伍，乘机混水摸鱼。
    第三、当他混入工人阶级的队伍，取得更高的地位和更大的权力以后，必然篡夺工人阶级的领导，以便按照资产阶级的面貌来改造世界，复辟资本主义。
    不管毕鸣岐自觉或不自觉，但是，他的根深蒂固的资产阶级思想，是在支配着他向这样一条绝路走去。毕鸣岐今天受到工人阶级这样的优待，得到这样高的地位，但是他并不满足。他还要求更高的地位和权力，他在工作上积极肯干，这是好的。但是，他却因此骄傲自负，觉得他的贡献很大，进步很快，才干很强，可是党和政府却没有给予他应得的报酬。他因此对党不满。他抓住一切机会，利用一切手段来争权夺位，极力往上爬。在这方面，他表现了贪得无餍的野心。尽管毕鸣岐不愿意人们强调两面性，但，这正是资产阶级两面性中消极一面的最露骨的反映。资产阶级，当生产资料还在手上的时候，他们的阶级本质表现为唯利是图。当生产资料已经交出，除了按规定拿定息而外，不能为所欲为地剥削的时候，他们并不甘心，于是他们的资产阶级思想就表现为唯地位和权力是争。在毕鸣岐身上，这个问题看得特别明显。在过去，是为发财而努力，在现在，是为升官而奋斗。他自己曾经表示，总路线公布以后，他的名欲重起来了。天津市安排他为副市长时，他对人说：他在两三年前就已经考虑到了，只不过是时间早晚的问题。去年天津民建改选，他要求天津民建和工商联的主委都由他一人来干。为了达到目的，他不惜搞小集团、拉拢人、封官许愿。并曾扬言要把进出口业五百多个资本家都拉入民建会，以增加其势力。毕鸣岐在争权夺位上还充分表现了他的霸道和独占性。他恨不能把别的“对手”一概打倒，一切工作都由他自己一个包办，一切功劳都归他自己一人所有，因而，党所给与的一切荣誉、地位和利益都归他自己一人独占。这正是大资产阶级那种垄断性的鲜明的反映。
    毕鸣岐处在这样的地位上，还有一个不能满足的地方，那就是不能为所欲为，不能按照自己资产阶级的思想面貌来进行领导。他恨不能夺下工人阶级手上的“令字旗”。他认为他所以拿不到“令字旗”的原因，是自己头上还戴着资产阶级的帽子，是有人还抓住两面性和阶级关系不放。但是，为要摘掉资产阶级的帽子，他并不是努力改造自己的思想，而是夸大资产阶级分子的进步性，掩盖他们的落后性，希图模糊工人阶级与资产阶级之间的界限，以便混入工人阶级的队伍。混入工人阶级的队伍以后，他想干什么呢？他自己检讨说：“变成工人阶级以后，可以取得发言权，……最终目的是想在工人阶级中取得在我工作上的领导权。”奇怪！毕鸣岐难道现在没有发言权和工作上的领导权吗？毕鸣岐身为全国人民代表大会的代表、天津市副市长、政协天津市委员会副主席、全国工商联副主委、天津工商联主委，身兼数要职。他不但有发言权，也有工作上的领导权。前不久，毕鸣岐在中央统战部召开的座谈会上，讲了那样多话还登了那末多报。那末，他还要取得什么样的发言权和工作上的领导权呢？原来他所要求的是按照资产阶级的面貌来改造世界的发言权和工作上的领导权。他们对于在工人阶级领导下的发言权和工作上的领导权是不满足的。总感到格格不入，不能随心所欲，不能按照他们自己的方式办事情。这种满足，他们是永远得不到的。因为要使他们满足，就只有资本主义复辟。这是全国人民坚决反对的！
    毕鸣岐总说他发表这些谬论的动机是善意的，是从好的愿望出发的。真实的情况究竟怎样呢？我们且看他在小组会上自己的招供。他在小组会上说：“在我散发这些谬论的时候，我还错误地认为这是代表资产阶级的正当利益，这样就会进一步增加我在工商界的威信，获得更多的支持者。”他真是代表了资产阶级的“利益”。他所代表的是什么样的“利益”呢？他代表的是资产阶级反动的、倒退的“利益”。他代表了资产阶级美化自己，看不起工人阶级，不甘心退出历史舞台的“利益”。他代表了资产阶级不安于现在所处的地位，抗拒社会主义改造，抗拒党的领导的
  “利益”。他企图煽起资产阶级的不满，组织起阶级的队伍向党进攻。并从这种进攻中达到他自己卑劣的可耻的个人目的。这就是毕鸣岐的动机。这就是毕鸣岐所说的“到了紧要关头，尾巴就露出来了”的真实面貌。
    工商业者应当正视现实，正视自己，努力自我改造
    毕鸣岐的思想，给我们工商界响亮地敲了一声警钟。尽管毕鸣岐说他已经改造的差不多，但是，他的资产阶级思想还这样严重。尽管我们有若干的进步，但是不少人听着章乃器、毕鸣岐的言论还感到舒服。这就说明我们思想中的落后一面还有和他们共鸣之处。他的言论助长了我们工商业者的骄傲自满，挑起我们对于目前所处的地位，对于继续进行改造以及对于党的领导的不满情绪。它不仅障碍我们继续进行改造，而且会使我们犯严重的错误。
    作为一个工商业者，我可以诚恳地说：党对我们资产阶级进行和平改造的工作，是做得仁至义尽的。八年来，党和人民政府苦心孤诣做了很多工作，一步一步平稳地把我们过渡到社会主义。当一九五○年私营企业发生困难的时候，党曾经发动工人阶级帮助我们渡过难关。在全行业合营以前又采取统筹兼顾，全面安排的政策，连企业带人整个包下来，使我们许多工商业者免于淘汰和破产。在全行业合营以后，给我们定息，给我们工作，给我们政治地位。我们不少的同业，原来只是当一个小厂厂长的，现在当了一个大厂的厂长或副厂长。原来只是管理一个企业的，现在当了一个公司的经理或副经理，管理着十几个或几十个企业。还有一些人安排了副市长、副局长、副区长，等等。这样一些安排，在旧社会，我们是梦想不到的。这些工作岗位对我们说来是小才大用，而不是大才小用。不少在革命战争中出生入死，才、德、功勋比我们高得多的共产党员，位置反在我们之下。如果我们真是有一点心，我们对于工人阶级这种大公无私的精神，能不感到感激和惭愧吗？我们生在今天，要生活有生活，要工作有工作，要地位有地位，再没有任何风险。世界上有这样幸福的资产阶级吗？共产党有哪一点对不起我们的地方呢？如果我们不是坚持资产阶级的立场、观点，有什么理由骄傲自满？有什么理由不满意今天所处的地位？又有什么理由不满意党的领导呢？
    我们工商业者，在社会主义改造的高潮当中，曾经喊出了一个响亮的口号：“听毛主席的话，跟着共产党，走社会主义的路”。这是我们工商业者唯一的光明前途。任何企图走别的道路的人，事实证明是会碰得头破血流的。我们必须正视现实，正视自己，老老实实服从工人阶级的领导，认真进行脱胎换骨的改造，在劳动中提高自己的认识水平和业务水平，兢兢业业地为人民服务。这才是工商业者的康庄大道。
