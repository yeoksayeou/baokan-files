    Strange Happenings in the Lanzhou Market
    Old Women's Hairnets
    In the Lanzhou Department Store, there's a staff member with extensive business experience. The leadership trusts him so much that they allow him to go on purchasing trips without a purchasing plan. Who knows what this buyer was thinking, but he bought seventy thousand hairnets all at once.
    Indeed, Lanzhou had nearly seven hundred thousand people at that time. However, hairnets are specifically for old women to wear, and even now, not all old women want to wear hairnets.
    Panic Buying of Bed Boards
    In the fourth quarter of last year, Lanzhou experienced a bed board shortage. Some commercial departments saw this opportunity as a good way to "make money." Furniture companies, trading companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as trust companies and native produce stores that didn't even need to deal in bed boards, sent dozens of buyers from seven or eight units like a swarm of bees to Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei and other places, buying up more than three hundred thousand bed boards. Now, these commercial departments have to ask their buyers to beg for returns.
    Since last year, Lanzhou's population has only increased by a little over one hundred thousand. Even at this rate of population growth, three hundred thousand bed boards would be enough to sell for three years. Strangely, when these departments were keen on panic buying, none of them considered whether their department should be dealing in bed boards, or how large the market demand was.
    Buying Scallions from Afar
    Last winter, Lanzhou experienced a scallion shortage, and the queues to buy scallions were as long as snakes. According to the business section chief of the Lanzhou Vegetable Company, "There are many outsiders in Lanzhou, and they all like to eat scallions, but Lanzhou produces very few scallions." To solve the problem of queuing to buy scallions, they quickly bought tens of thousands of jin of scallions from Shandong and Henan provinces to meet market demand. However, at the same time, it was discovered that more than one hundred thousand jin of scallions were being grown near Lanzhou. Now, there is an unprecedented abundance of scallions on the market, which have become stockpiled and moldy.
    Goods at the Railway Station
    Currently, every warehouse of the Lanzhou Department Store is filled to the brim with daily necessities, but there are still mountains of goods piled up at the Lanzhou West Railway Station. These goods have been sleeping outdoors at the railway station for more than three months. Recently, large tarpaulins were used to build sheds for them, turning the railway station into a temporary warehouse. Recently, the department store inventoried a portion of the goods piled up at the railway station and found that dozens of these goods, which had been stored for three months, had been out of stock in the market for a long time, some even for more than a year.
    The department store manager told us: The reason why these goods have not been put into storage is not only because the warehouse is full, but more importantly, the procedures have not been completed. We asked him: How many layers of procedures do your goods need to go through from arriving at the station to meeting customers in the retail department? He said: Major steps involve eight or nine layers; small ones, countless. (Xinhua News Agency special dispatch, edited by this newspaper)

### 兰州市场的怪事

    兰州市场的怪事
    老太婆的发网
    兰州市百货公司有一位很有经营商业经验的工作人员，领导上对他很信任，他没有采购计划，领导上可以让他出发采购。不知这个采购员怎么想的，他一下子就买了七十万只发网。
    的确，那时兰州市有将近七十万人。但是，发网是专门给老太婆戴用的呀，何况现在的老太婆也不是人人都要戴发网的。
    抢购床板
    去年第四季度，兰州市曾一度发生床板脱销，某些商业部门把这个机会看成“生财”的好机会。家俱公司、贸易公司、供销社以及无须经营床板的信托公司、土产商店等七、八个单位的好几十名采购员，像一窝蜂似的赶到河南、江西、湖北等地抢购了三十多万副床板，现在，这些商业部门只好又叫采购员到处乞求退货。
    从去年以来，兰州市的人口不过增加了十多万。就按这样的人口增长速度，三十几万副床板已够卖三年之久。说起来也奇怪，当这些部门热衷于抢购之际，谁也没有考虑一下本部门是否应该经营床板，市场需要量又有多大？
    千里迢迢买大葱
    去年冬天，兰州市大葱脱销，排队买大葱的人像摆长蛇阵一样。据兰州市蔬菜公司业务科长说：“兰州市外来人多，外来人都喜欢吃大葱，而兰州产大葱很少”。他们为了解决买大葱排队的现象，赶快到山东、河南两省买进了几万斤大葱，应付市场需要。但是在这同时，发现兰州市附近还种有十几万斤大葱。现在市场上的大葱空前多起来，变成积压、霉烂的东西了。
    火车站上的货物
    现在，兰州市百货公司的每一个仓库，已被日用百货装得满满的，可是还有山一样的货物堆积在兰州西火车站。这些货物已经在火车站露宿了三个多月，最近才用大帆布为它们搭了凉棚，把火车站变成临时仓库。最近百货公司清点了火车站堆积的一部分货物，发现这些放了三个多月的货物里，有几十种是市场很久以来就脱销的，有的甚至脱销一年多了。
    百货公司经理告诉我们：这些货物迟迟未入库的原因，除仓库装不下外，重要的是没办完手续。我们问他：你们的货物从到车站再到门市部和顾客见面，需要经过多少层手续？他说：大的环节要经过八九层；小的，那就数不清了。（新华社专稿，本报有删节）
