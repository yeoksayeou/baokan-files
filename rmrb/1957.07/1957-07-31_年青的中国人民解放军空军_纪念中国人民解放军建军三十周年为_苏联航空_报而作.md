    The Young Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    -- Written for the "Soviet Aviation" newspaper in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Liu Yalou, General of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    This year's "August 1st" (Army Day), the Chinese people warmly celebrate the 30th anniversary of the birth of their People's Liberation Army. Over the past thirty years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has traversed a glorious and arduous path of struggle. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it has fought alongside the people of the whole country to overcome powerful enemies at home and abroad, and achieved great victories in the revolution. Since the founding of the new China, it has shouldered the task of defending the national defense and the socialist construction of the motherland.

    The Chinese people's revolutionary war achieved victory mainly by relying on the army, under conditions where there was no air force. The conditions at the time made it impossible for the People's Liberation Army to establish its own air force, and it could only use infantry weapons and a small amount of anti-aircraft artillery to deal with enemy attacks from the air. The Chinese people had long yearned to establish their own air force. When the revolution had just achieved victory throughout the country, Chairman Mao instructed us: "Our national defense will be consolidated, and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again. On the basis of the heroic and tested People's Liberation Army, our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed. We will have not only a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, our Party and government used great efforts to start the construction of the people's air force.

    Building such a modern military service as the air force involves various difficulties. The national economy was riddled with holes when the new China was first founded, the industrial base was weak, and there was no aviation industry; the Kuomintang's air force was not strong to begin with, and before the liberation of the mainland, most of them fled to Taiwan, with only a few personnel defecting and reporting to us. Therefore, the construction of the people's air force had no original foundation to rely on in terms of aviation technicians and equipment. In addition, at the beginning of the liberation, the Kuomintang's navy and air force constantly harassed and sabotaged the coastal areas, and then the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism broke out, directly threatening our country's security. Therefore, the people's air force faced urgent combat tasks from its birth. However, no difficulties can stop us from moving forward. We conducted intensive training, learning and applying at the same time, building while fighting, and quickly went to the front line against aggression and defending the motherland. After eight years of effort, a Chinese people's own air force finally grew up in combat. "Although our country's air force is not as good as the largest air force countries, it is already not a very weak air force country." (Peng Dehuai's speech at the Eighth National Congress of the CPC)

    Faced with the American aggression against Korea, the Chinese people were forced to organize the Chinese People's Volunteers to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to counter the aggressors. The young Chinese aviation personnel enthusiastically joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and entered the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. At that time, the young pilots of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were faced with a group of cunning and treacherous American air bandits. It was a severe test for our young pilots to deal with such ferocious and arrogant enemies. However, the commanders and fighters of the people's army possessed a fighting spirit of loyalty to the motherland and fearlessness. They withstood this test. In the fierce air battles, many heroic and indomitable, touching combat deeds appeared, severely打击 (dǎjī strike a blow at, attack) the so-called "air superiority" of the US military invading Korea, covering the ground forces of the Volunteers, and defending important targets on the Sino-Korean border. George A. Davis, the American "double air hero ace pilot" who was boasted about, was shot down by Zhang Jihui, a pilot of the Volunteers; pilot Liu Yudi bravely shot down four enemy planes in one air battle; pilot Luo Canghai continuously shot down three enemy planes in one air battle; although the planes of wingmen pilots Jiao Jingwen and Li Yongtai were injured in more than twenty or even fifty places, they still closely followed the lead plane, covered the lead plane to attack the enemy, completed the combat mission, and returned victoriously; The Bi Wubin bomber crew, under the interception of a large group of enemy fighter planes, drove the plane with raging fire, went forward bravely, rushed to the predetermined target and dropped the bombs on the enemy's position to complete the mission, and sacrificed heroically. Anti-aircraft artillery regiment × continuously shot down and wounded eighteen enemy planes in the counterattack against the invasion of 275 enemy planes; another unit crushed the enemy's conspiracy to cut off our transportation in a week with 1,500 sorties, ensuring the supply of ground forces.

    The Air Force of the People's Liberation Army vigilantly guards the skies of the motherland while undertaking the task of homeland air defense operations, and constantly strikes at invading enemy planes along the coast and borders, safeguarding the safety of the motherland. In recent years, many heroic deeds and outstanding figures have emerged. Harold Fischer Edwards, the American boasted "double air ace pilot" and "first-class jet air hero," was captured alive after being shot down by Han Decai, a young pilot of peasant origin in the People's Air Force who was nineteen years old with less than 250 hours of total flight time (including trainer planes at aviation school) when he invaded our Northeast airspace. In an air battle to defend Shanghai, pilots Song Zhongwen and He Zhongdao pressed the enemy plane from high altitude to low altitude, making it impossible for the cunning enemy plane to escape, and was pressed into the sea all the way; pilot Lu Min once shot down an enemy plane that came to sneak attack in the dark and lightless airspace. In the struggle to liberate the enemy-occupied islands along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, Zhang Weiliang's and Cai Zhichen's crews, Song Zongzhou's and Yan Shusen's crews, and Liu Jianhan's crews successively destroyed and damaged five Kuomintang "Zhong" (meaning "Central") class warships and destroyed the enemy's fortifications on the islands, closely coordinating the army and navy to liberate Yijiangshan and Dachen Islands. Two regiments of anti-aircraft artillery troops once shot down seventeen enemy planes and wounded forty-six in a week. Air Force pilots Yao Changchuan, Han Lin, Wang Hongzhi, etc., overcame numerous difficulties, bravely broke through the so-called "air forbidden zone," opened up the Kangzang Plateau air route that crossed the "roof of the world" and took off and landed at the world's highest airport more than 5,000 meters above sea level; and opened up the air route from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to India.

    The People's Air Force has also trained a group of female aviation personnel, who are now able to fly day and night, successfully completing various flight missions, opening a new page in the history of Chinese women.

    While performing the glorious task of defending the motherland, the commanders and fighters of the People's Air Force have always seized political education, flight and combat training, and continuously improved their political awareness, technical and tactical levels, and have trained a large number of first-class pilots and cadres who can master various aviation business technologies. Through hard study day and night, the People's Air Force has been able to undertake combat tasks in various weather conditions day and night.

    With the development of my country's socialist industry, the Chinese people have their own aviation industry and have begun to produce new jet aircraft. The soldiers of the People's Air Force are flying Chinese-made aircraft in the skies of the motherland.

    In order to support the economic construction of the motherland, the commanders and fighters of the People's Air Force actively responded to the call to build the country diligently and thriftily, and to build the army diligently and thriftily, practiced strict economy, opposed waste, saved expenses, and cherished every piece of equipment, every piece of equipment, every drop of fuel, and every bullet; launched a movement to support agricultural cooperation, and assisted the construction of rural areas and cities in various aspects; participated in aviation surveying, transportation, and other work; when the people suffered natural disasters, they also participated in the struggle to bomb the ice dam of the Yellow River, drop supplies by air, and eliminate locusts. The civil aviation undertaking of the new China has also been established and is developing day by day, and is playing an important role in the cause of socialist construction.

    Why has the People's Air Force been able to grow rapidly at an unprecedented speed in the world in the face of powerful enemies and numerous difficulties? This is mainly due to: the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, the rich experience and fine traditions of the long-tested army as the foundation, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao are very concerned about the construction of the People's Air Force, and have given the People's Air Force correct military building policies, routes, strategies and tactics, and political work principles, as well as instructions on various important tasks. The leadership of the Party has given us the correct direction and the strength to overcome difficulties. The people of the whole country strongly support the construction of the People's Air Force, and are responsive to every request. Workers and peasants send their outstanding children to join the Air Force, and provide huge human and material resources to supply the needs of Air Force construction. Millions of outstanding workers and peasants enthusiastically apply for air force schools. The experience of the construction of the People's Air Force once again proves that the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the support of the people of the whole country are the endless source of our army's combat effectiveness; continuously strengthening the Party's leadership in the army, closely linking with the masses of the people, and always maintaining the essence of the people's army are the fundamental guarantees for our army to achieve victory.

    The reason why the People's Air Force can overcome difficulties and grow rapidly is also due to the rich experience and fine traditions of the long-tested army as the foundation. "Building the Air Force on the basis of the Army" is an important principle for building the People's Air Force. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a combative army tempered in the long-term revolutionary flames, with rich experience and glorious traditions. The People's Air Force was established on this basis. Like all services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the People's Air Force has maintained the essence of the people's army: the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, the principle of unity between the army and the people and between officers and soldiers, the style of linking theory with practice, linking with the masses, criticism and self-criticism, the working method of the mass line, revolutionary heroism and the spirit of hard struggle, democracy under centralized guidance, and consciously strict discipline, etc. Over the past thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have formulated the strategy and tactics of the Chinese people's revolutionary war based on the universal truth of Marxism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and formulated a correct military line that is completely suitable for the Chinese situation. Mao Zedong's military thought not only guided the Chinese revolutionary war to victory in the past under extremely difficult conditions, but also remains the guiding thought that our army must resolutely follow in realizing the modernization of the army and in the future struggle to smash imperialist aggression.

    The People's Air Force adheres to the system of division of responsibilities by the chief under the collective leadership of the Party committee, the system of political work in the army, and the system of democracy in the army. The system of division of responsibilities by the chief under the collective leadership of the Party committee is the fundamental system of leadership work in the People's Liberation Army. In the Air Force, which is a technically complex military service with many departments and requiring a high degree of centralization and close coordination in all tasks, we have realized more deeply that: only by implementing the system that combines the collective leadership of the Party committee and the division of responsibilities by the chief can we better ensure the Party's leadership over the army, the implementation of the Party's policies and state laws; can we give play to the collective wisdom and the enthusiasm and creativity of the chief's personal responsibility, prevent purely military viewpoints and individualistic tendencies, and prevent the subjective one-sidedness of individuals' views; can we enable the heads of departments to understand the overall situation, unify understanding, and better ensure the centralized command, unified action of the troops, and implement powerful and timely command in accordance with the actual situation, and quickly and correctly handle various problems in the work. Political work is the lifeline of our army. The Party, through political organs, constantly improves the political awareness of the troops, strengthens internal unity and the unity between the army and the people, and gives play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all personnel; consolidates and improves combat effectiveness, mobilizes the broad masses of the people to support and participate in the revolutionary war, and disintegrates and wins over the enemy army. In order to adapt to the training and combat requirements of the Air Force, the Air Force's political work emphasizes the combination with professional technology, emphasizes ideological and political work among technical personnel, and emphasizes that political work should adapt to the characteristics of activities in the vast sky, and injects ideological and political work into combat, training, and various activities, giving full play to the role of political work. In order to ensure the victory of the war and the completion of various tasks.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army with strong revolutionary discipline, and it is also an army with a high degree of democratic life. Democracy in our army is multifaceted, including political democracy, military democracy (including technical democracy), and economic democracy. In all work, we need both top-down leadership and bottom-up democratic discussion. The mass line of combining democracy with centralism and combining leadership with the masses is the unwavering working line of our army. For example: Before the implementation of the battle, if conditions permit, tell the broad masses of officers and soldiers the combat tasks, the conditions and methods for achieving victory, mobilize them to "raise questions, think of ways, and set plans," so that the leader's plans and determination become the masses' own plans and determination; After the battle is over, implement democratic "three evaluations," that is, evaluate command, evaluate action, and evaluate discipline. The experience is summarized through evaluation, so that every officer and soldier receives practical education, so as to "fight a battle and move a step further"; implement mutual teaching between officers and soldiers, mutual teaching between superiors and subordinates, teaching each other and growing together in training, so as to "fly once and move a step further"; important measures in daily work are also discussed by the masses, the opinions are concentrated, and then adhered to. Carry out the campaign to establish meritorious service and create excellence, implement mutual assistance, solve technical difficulties, and promote advanced experience in various ways. In order to do a good job, not only can superiors criticize subordinates, but subordinates can also criticize superiors on certain occasions. This will not only not damage the prestige of cadres and weaken the discipline of the troops, but on the contrary, make the masses sincerely convinced and consciously obey, so that they can form a prestige that can truly stand the test and establish an iron discipline based on consciousness.

    Under the leadership of the Party, all comrades in the Air Force inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and gave play to a high degree of responsibility and initiative. They are jointly responsible for the outcome of the war, the honor of the army, and the quality of discipline, and even do not hesitate to dedicate their lives. Ensuring the victory and completion of combat and various tasks. In the past eight years, 57 heroes have emerged in the entire Air Force, more than 60,000 people have performed meritorious services, 1,820 units have performed collective meritorious services, and many inventions and creations and rationalization proposals have been put forward.

    The vast majority of command cadres and most of the flight personnel of the People's Air Force are worker-peasant backbone transferred from the army, and they have undergone long-term combat tests and work training in the army. In terms of aviation technology business learning, although some of them encountered many difficulties due to their low level of education, they gave play to a tenacious spirit of research, worked hard, and learned twice or three times if they did not learn once. In this way, they finally overcame the numerous difficulties placed before them, learned complex aviation technical knowledge, and acquired the ability to conduct air combat and command air combat. Some former army platoon, company, and battalion commanders who did not know many characters have now become excellent pilots and commanders. Some have become experts in navigation, aircraft maintenance, and air force logistics. In combat, although the young People's Air Force faced powerful and cunning opponents in the first battle, we had a high degree of political consciousness, the brave and tenacious combat style and rich ground combat experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and therefore were able to give the enemy a heavy blow. For example, at the beginning of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, some pilots of the People's Volunteers had only flown forty or fifty hours on fighter planes, and shot down American pilots who had flown one or two thousand hours and participated in World War II in air battles. The squadron commanded by Wang Hai, the squadron commander, created a brilliant record of shooting down fifteen enemy planes in a row without any losses. Wang Tianbao, the deputy squadron commander, once shot down three American F-86 planes and wounded five in one battle with La-11 planes. Liu Shaoji's crew shot down the enemy's F-86 fighter plane with a Tu-2 bomber. The vast number of ground staff worked hard day and night in the hot summer and cold winter, demonstrating a spirit of arduous struggle. The above are important factors why we were able to grow rapidly and defeat the powerful and arrogant enemy even under the conditions of insufficient technology and tactics and experience.

    The People's Air Force has been able to overcome difficulties and continue to grow and develop because of the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. When our country started to build the People's Air Force, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people showed a high degree of internationalism and gave us strong support and assistance in all aspects. Not only did they give us first-class modern equipment, but they also sent a large number of experts with extensive knowledge and rich experience to teach us exquisite aviation science knowledge, excellent aviation technology and air force tactics, as well as various advanced experiences. These expert comrades demonstrated a high degree of internationalism, patriotism, and a responsible attitude in their work. The deeds of Soviet Air Force heroes such as Kozhedub and Pokryshkin have become models recited by every soldier of the Chinese People's Air Force. The Soviet Air Force is the world's most powerful air force that has undergone arduous tests. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and such an advanced air force as an example, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force has been able to grow rapidly in a relatively short period of time. This is something that the Chinese people will never forget. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force wholeheartedly thank the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government and people, and the Soviet Air Force.

    In the past eight years, although the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has developed rapidly, it is still very young, and it still lacks sufficient knowledge and experience in tactics, technology, aviation science, and various business constructions. There are still many shortcomings and even mistakes in various tasks. We have no reason to be proud and complacent. In order to successfully carry out Chairman Mao's glorious task of "building a strong people's air force, defending the motherland, and preparing to defeat the invaders," we must work diligently, work hard, and advance bravely. We must inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, respond to the Party Central Committee's call to "march towards science," launch a learning upsurge, and learn what we are not familiar with and do not know. In addition to learning from practice, summarizing and improving our own experience, we must continue to humbly learn from our elder brother, the Soviet Air Force, and the air forces of socialist countries, learn all the advanced experience of the Soviet Air Force, and closely combine it with the specific situation of our army.

    At present, although the overall international situation tends to be eased, the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is still adhering to the policies of aggression and war, creating tension, and desperately strengthening its air force. In particular, US imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, carrying out sabotage and threats against us. We are the sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and we are the guardians of the socialist construction of the motherland and world peace. We must stand vigilantly at our posts with great vigilance and resolutely complete the glorious task of defending the motherland and liberating Taiwan together with the people of the whole country. The unity and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union is a strong fortress for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. We must always stand with the Soviet Union, stand with all socialist countries, and stand with all peace-loving people in the world to strive to defend world peace and the progressive cause of all mankind!

    年青的中国人民解放军空军
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年为“苏联航空”报而作
    中国人民解放军空军上将　刘亚楼
    今年的“八一”，中国人民热烈庆祝自己的人民解放军诞生三十周年。三十年来，中国人民解放军经历了一条光荣的艰巨的战斗道路，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下同全国人民一起，战胜了国内外的强大敌人，取得了革命的伟大胜利。在新中国成立以后，又担负起保卫国防、保卫祖国社会主义建设的任务。
    中国人民的革命战争，是在没有空军的条件下，主要依靠陆军取得胜利的。当时的条件使人民解放军不可能建立自己的空军，只能以步兵武器和少量的高射炮兵对付敌人来自空中的攻击。中国人民早就渴望着建立一支自己的空军。当革命刚在全国范围内取得胜利的时候，毛主席就指示我们：“我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。在英勇的经过了考验的人民解放军的基础上，我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”遵照毛主席的指示，我们的党和政府用了很大的力量来着手人民空军的建设工作。
    建设空军这样一支现代化的军种，是有着种种困难的。新中国刚刚成立，国民经济百孔千疮，工业基础薄弱，更没有航空工业；国民党的空军本来就不强，大陆解放前夕，绝大部分逃往台湾，只有少数人员向我们起义、报到。因此，人民空军的建设在航空技术人员和装备方面，没有什么原有基础可以凭借；加以解放之初国民党的海、空军不断地对沿海地区进行骚扰破坏，接着又爆发了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，直接威胁着我国的安全。所以，人民空军一诞生就面临着紧迫的战斗任务。但是，任何困难都不能阻挡住我们前进，我们进行了突击训练，现学现用、边建边打，迅速走上反对侵略、保卫祖国的前线。经过八年来的努力，一支中国人民自己的空军终于在战斗中成长起来了。“现在我国的空军虽然比不上最大的空军国家，但也已经不是很弱的空军国家了。”（彭德怀同志在中共八大的发言）
    面对着美国对朝鲜的侵略，中国人民被迫组织了人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民军并肩反击侵略者。年青的中国航空人员踊跃地参加了中国人民志愿军，投入了抗美援朝作战。当时，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军年青的飞行员所遇到的是一批老奸巨滑的美国空中强盗，对于我们的年青的飞行员来说，要对付这样的凶恶骄横的敌人是一个严重的考验。但是人民军队的指战员们具有忠于祖国、英勇无畏的战斗精神，他们经住了这个考验，在激烈的空战中出现了许多英勇顽强、可歌可泣的战斗事迹，沉重地打击了侵朝美军的所谓“空中优势”，掩护了志愿军地面部队，保卫了中朝边境的重要目标。美国吹嘘的“双料空中英雄王牌驾驶员”乔治·阿·戴维斯，就是被志愿军飞行员张积慧击毙的；飞行员刘玉堤在一天空战中奋勇击落了四架敌机；飞行员罗沧海在一次空战中连续击落了三架敌机；僚机飞行员焦景文、李永泰虽然自己的飞机负伤二十多处甚至五十多处，仍然紧紧跟着长机，掩护长机向敌人进行攻击，完成了战斗任务，胜利返航；轰炸机毕武斌机组在敌人大群歼击机层层截击下，飞机被击伤起火仍然驾驶着熊熊烈火的飞机，勇往直前，冲向预定目标把炸弹投到敌军阵地完成任务以后，壮烈牺牲。高射炮兵×团在反击二百七十五架敌机的侵袭中，连续击落、击伤敌机十八架；另一个部队在一周内粉碎了一千五百架次敌机企图切断我交通运输的阴谋，保证了地面部队的供应。
    人民解放军空军在担负国土防空作战的任务中，警惕地守卫着祖国的天空，在沿海、在边疆不断地打击来犯的敌机，保卫祖国的安全。几年来，也涌现出很多英勇事迹和优秀人物。美国吹嘘的“双料王牌驾驶员”“第一流的喷气机空中英雄”哈罗德·费席尔·艾德华，就是在侵入我国东北领空时被人民空军一个十九岁的总飞行时间（包括航校教练机在内）二百五十小时以内的农民出身的青年飞行员韩德彩击落后生俘的。在保卫上海的一次空战中，飞行员宋中文、何忠道从高空把敌机压到低空，使狡猾的敌机无法逃脱，一直被压到窜入大海；飞行员鲁珉曾经在夜间无光空域里击落了前来偷袭的敌机。在解放浙东沿海敌占岛屿的斗争中，张卫良、蔡之臣机组，宋宗周、严树森机组，刘健汉机组，先后炸毁、炸伤国民党“中字号”等五艘舰艇，摧毁了岛上敌人的坚固工事，密切配合陆、海军解放了一江山和大陈等岛屿。高射炮兵部队的两个团曾经在一周内击落敌机十七架，击伤四十六架。人民空军的飞行员姚长川、韩琳、王洪智等，克服重重困难，英勇地突破了所谓“空中禁区”，开辟了越过“世界屋脊”的、起落于拔海五千公尺以上的世界上最高的机场的康藏高原航线；开辟了由西藏首府——拉萨通向印度的航线。
    人民空军还培养了一批女航空人员，她们已经能够在昼夜飞行，胜利地完成着各种飞行任务，在中国的妇女史上开辟了新的一页。
    在执行保卫祖国的光荣任务的同时，人民空军指战员们，时刻抓紧了政治教育、飞行和战斗训练，不断地提高着自己的政治觉悟、技术和战术水平，并且培养了大批一级飞行员和能够掌握各种航空业务技术的干部。经过日日夜夜辛勤的学习，人民空军已经能够担负昼夜各种气象条件下的战斗任务。
    随着我国社会主义工业的发展，中国人民已经有了自己的航空工业，开始生产新式喷气式飞机。人民空军战士正在驾驶着中国自制的飞机飞翔在祖国的天空。
    为了支援祖国的经济建设，人民空军指战员积极响应勤俭建国、勤俭建军的号召，厉行节约，反对浪费。节省经费开支，爱护每一项设备、每一件器材、每一滴油料、每一粒弹药；开展了支援农业合作化的运动，从各方面帮助农村和城市的建设；参加了航空测量、交通运输等工作；当人民遭受自然灾害的时候，还曾参加轰炸黄河冰坝、空投物资、捕灭蝗虫等抢险救灾的斗争。新中国的民航事业，也已经建立和日益发展起来，并在社会主义建设事业中发挥重要的作用。
    人民空军为什么能够在面对着强大的敌人和重重困难的情况下，以世界上史无前例的速度，迅速地成长起来呢？这主要是由于：中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导以及广大人民的热烈支援，有久经考验的陆军的丰富经验和优良传统作基础，有苏联的无私帮助。
    中国共产党中央、人民政府和毛主席十分关心人民空军的建设，给了人民空军以正确的建军方针、路线、战略战术和政治工作原则，以及各种重要工作的指示，党的领导使我们得到了正确的方向和克服困难的力量。全国人民大力支援着人民空军的建设，有求必应。工人农民送自己的优秀子弟参加空军，以巨大的人力、物力供给空军建设的需要。千百万优秀的工农青年踊跃报考空军学校。人民空军建设的经验再一次证明：共产党和毛主席的正确领导，全国人民的支援，是我军战斗力的无尽泉源；不断加强党在军队中的领导，密切联系人民群众，永远保持人民军队的本质，这是我军取得胜利的根本保证。
    人民空军所以能够战胜困难迅速成长，还由于有久经考验的陆军的丰富经验和优良传统作基础。“在陆军基础上建设空军”是人民空军建军的重要原则。中国人民解放军是在长期革命火焰中锻炼出来的、有战斗力的军队，它具有丰富的经验、光荣的传统。人民空军就是在这个基础上建立起来的。和中国人民解放军的一切军种一样，人民空军保持了人民军队的本质：全心全意为人民服务的宗旨、党对军队的绝对领导、马克思列宁主义的革命精神、军民一致、官兵一致的原则，联系实际、联系群众、批评和自我批评的作风，群众路线的工作方法，革命英雄主义和艰苦奋斗的精神，集中指导下的民主、自觉的铁的纪律等等。三十年来，中国共产党和毛主席根据马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践，制定了中国人民革命战争的战略战术，制定了一条完全适合于中国情况的正确的军事路线。毛泽东军事思想，不但在过去极端困难的条件下引导中国革命战争走向了胜利，而且在实现军队现代化建设和今后粉碎帝国主义侵略的斗争中，仍然是我军必须坚决遵循的指导思想。
    人民空军坚持实行了党委集体领导下的首长分工负责制、军队政治工作制度和军队民主制度。党委集体领导下的首长分工负责制，是人民解放军领导工作的根本制度。在空军这样一个技术复杂、部门繁多、各项工作都要具有高度集中、紧密协同的军种中，我们更加体会到：只有实行党委集体领导和首长分工负责相结合这一制度，才能更好地保证党对军队的领导、党的政策和国家法令的贯彻执行；才能发挥集体智慧和首长个人负责的积极性和创造精神，防止单纯军事观点和个人主义倾向，防止个人看问题的主观片面性；才能使部门首长了解全盘情况，统一认识，更好地保障部队的集中指挥、统一行动和按照实际情况实施强有力的及时指挥、迅速地正确地处理各项工作中的问题。政治工作是我军的生命线。党通过政治机关，不断提高部队的政治觉悟，加强军内团结和军民团结，发挥全体人员的积极性、创造性；巩固和提高战斗力，动员广大人民群众支援和参加革命战争，瓦解和争取敌军。为了适应空军的训练和作战的要求，空军的政治工作强调同业务技术相结合、强调在技术人员中的思想政治工作、强调政治工作要适应在辽阔的天空进行活动的特点，把思想政治工作灌注到战斗、训练和各种活动中去，充分发挥政治工作的作用。从而保证战争胜利和各项工作任务的完成。
    中国人民解放军是一支有坚强革命纪律的军队，又是一支有高度民主生活的军队。我军中民主是多方面的，有政治上的民主、军事上的民主（包括技术上的民主）和经济上的民主。在一切工作中，既需要自上而下的领导，又需要自下而上的民主讨论。民主同集中相结合、领导同群众相结合的群众路线，就是我军坚定不移的工作路线。比如：在战斗实施前，如果条件许可，就把战斗任务、取得胜利的条件和办法，告诉广大的官兵群众，发动他们“提问题、想办法、定方案”，使领导者的计划和决心，变成群众自己的计划和决心；战斗结束以后，实行民主“三评”，即评指挥、评动作、评纪律。通过评比来总结经验，使每个官兵都受到实际的教育，以求“打一仗、进一步”；在训练中实行官兵互教、上下互教、教学相长、共同提高，以求“飞一次，进一步”；日常工作中的重要措施，也通过群众讨论，把意见集中起来，再坚持下去。开展立功创优运动，实行互助，解决技术难点，通过各种方式，推广先进经验。为了做好工作，不仅上级可以批评下级，下级也可以在一定场合批评上级。这样不仅不会损害干部的威信和削弱部队的纪律，相反地，使群众心悦诚服、自觉服从，这样就能形成真正经得起考验的威信和建立在自觉的基础之上的铁的纪律。
    空军全体同志在党的领导下，继承和发扬了人民解放军的优良传统，发挥了高度的责任感和积极性，他们共同为战争的胜负、军队的荣誉和纪律的好坏负责任，甚至不惜献出自己的生命。保证了战斗和各项任务的胜利完成。八年来，全空军涌现了五十七名英雄，有六万多人立了功，有一千八百二十个单位立了集体功，提出了不少发明创造和合理化建议。
    人民空军的绝大多数指挥干部和大部分飞行人员都是从陆军调来的工农骨干，他们在陆军中经过了长期的战斗考验和工作锻炼。在航空技术业务学习方面，他们中一部分人虽然由于文化程度不高，遇到不少困难，但是，他们发挥了顽强的钻研精神，勤学苦练，一遍不会就学两遍、三遍，白天学习时间不够，就晚上继续学到深夜。这样终于克服了摆在他们面前的重重困难，学会了复杂的航空技术知识和进行空战、指挥空战的能力。有的过去识字还不多的陆军排、连、营长现在已成为优秀的飞行员和指挥员。有的在领航、机务、空军后勤等工作中成了能手。在作战中，年青的人民空军虽然初战就面对着强大狡猾的对手，但是我们有着高度的政治觉悟，具有中国人民解放军勇敢、顽强的战斗作风和丰富的地面作战经验，因而能够给敌人以沉重的打击。比如，抗美援朝战争开始时，人民志愿军飞行员有的在战斗机上不过只飞了四五十小时，在空战中击落了飞过一两千小时、参加过第二次世界大战的美国飞行员。飞行大队长王海同志所指挥的大队创造了一连击落十五架敌机自己没有损失的光辉战迹。飞行副大队长王天保等同志曾经以拉十一飞机在一次战斗中击落美国F—86飞机三架和击伤五架。刘绍基机组以杜二轰炸机击落敌人F—86歼击机。广大的地面工作人员，不避艰难，在酷暑严寒的季节里，日日夜夜，辛勤劳动，表现了艰苦卓绝的精神。以上这些正是我们所以能迅速成长并且在技术、战术上经验都还不足的条件下，却能够战胜强大骄横的敌人的一个重要因素。
    人民空军所以能够战胜困难不断发展壮大，还由于有苏联的无私援助，当我们国家着手建立人民空军的时候，苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民表现了高度的国际主义精神，从各方面给了我们大力的支持和帮助。不仅给了我们头等的现代化的装备，而且派来了大批具有渊博知识和丰富经验的专家，教给我们精湛的航空科学知识、卓越的航空技术和空军战术，以及各种先进经验。这些专家同志们在工作中表现了高度的国际主义、爱国主义精神和认真负责的作风。阔日杜布、包克雷什金等苏联空军英雄的事迹，已成为中国人民空军战士人人传诵的楷模。苏联空军是经历过艰巨考验的世界上最强大的空军，有着苏联的无私帮助和这样先进的空军作榜样，所以中国人民解放军空军能够在较短的时间里迅速地成长起来。这是中国人民所永志不忘的。中国人民解放军空军指战员们衷心地感谢苏联共产党、苏联政府和人民以及苏联空军。
    八年来，中国人民解放军空军虽然有了迅速的发展，但是它还很年青，在战术、技术、航空科学和各种业务建设上，都还缺乏足够的知识和经验，各项工作中还有不少缺点甚至错误。我们没有任何理由可以骄傲自满。为了胜利地执行毛主席指示的“建立一支强大的人民空军，保卫祖国，准备战胜侵略者”的光荣任务，我们必须兢兢业业、艰苦努力，勇敢前进。我们要继承和发扬中国人民解放军的光荣传统，响应党中央“向科学进军”，的号召，掀起学习热潮，学会我们还不熟悉和不知道的东西。除了从实践中学习、总结和提高我们自己的经验以外，我们还要继续虚心向我们的老大哥苏联空军和社会主义各国的空军学习，把苏联空军的一切先进经验学到手，并且同我军的具体情况紧密地结合起来。
    目前，国际上总的局势虽然趋向和缓，但是，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团还在坚持侵略政策和战争政策，制造紧张局势，拚命加强它的空军，特别是美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，对我们进行破坏和威胁。我们是中国人民的子弟兵，是祖国社会主义建设和世界和平的卫士，我们一定万分警惕地站在自己的岗位上，和全国人民一道坚决完成保卫祖国，解放台湾的光荣任务。中苏两国的团结互助是维护远东和世界和平的坚强堡垒，我们要永远同苏联站在一起，和各社会主义国家站在一起，和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为保卫世界和平和全人类的进步事业而奋斗！
