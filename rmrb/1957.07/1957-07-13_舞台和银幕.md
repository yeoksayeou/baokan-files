Stage and Screen

Demons Dance Wildly, Ugliness Fully Exposed
New Zhongshan Wolf to be Performed Soon

The Shanghai Popular Drama Troupe has brought into play the characteristics of popular drama, using the newly written current affairs drama "New Zhongshan Wolf" to participate in the anti-Rightist struggle. This play will soon be staged in the capital.

This play exposes the rightists' plot, before the national liberation, to attempt to seize some military power before the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River to the south, and to form a third route to confront the Communist Party; as well as their conspiracy to use American economic aid to obtain important positions in the People's Government. At the same time, it also exposes the right-wing ambitious schemers who wanted to take advantage of the Communist Party's rectification movement, ordering their minions and lackeys to launch a frenzied attack on science, education, and literature and art. Here you can see the vicious faces and ugly souls of the right-wing ambitious schemers. (Lan)

Cuckoo Sings on the Beijing Stage

The "The Cuckoo Calls Again," which the Beijing People's Art Theatre is starting to perform tonight, is a good play reflecting the love life of young people in the real countryside with a unique comedic style. This play has been performed in the Jiangnan area and has been well received by audiences.

The author uses the twists and turns of the love life of the young and lively girl "Cuckoo" as the main thread, and from the sharp contrast and complex entanglements between the relationships of the two couples, Tong Yahua, Lei Dahan, and Guo Jialin, Shi Xiu'e, it shows the new relationships between people in many aspects. The whole play, like the young girl "Cuckoo," is a song full of youth, vitality, joy, and brightness.

The realistic and vivid characters and the life-like, lighthearted, and joyful comedic style are the prominent features of this play. (Chun Di)

Husband and Wife Have Conflicts, White Flag Raises a Disturbance

"The Disturbance of the White Flag" is adapted from Ji Xuepei's short story of the same name. The film reveals the new qualities and new feelings of people growing up with the establishment of the new system through the beautiful but conflicting life of a young couple, and criticizes the remnants of the husband's authority thought left to people by the feudal system. This contradiction between new and old ideas constitutes the dramatic conflict of the film. The interesting comedic scenes in the film are handled very well, not only are they extremely harmonious with the entire plot, but they also make people feel that the author's criticism of those kind but flawed people is done with a great sense of proportion and is not excessive. What is felt to be insufficient is that the story is still a bit monotonous, and the exploration of the characters is not enough. (Shi)

"Four Small Coins" is Hilarious

The Soviet color puppet film "Four Small Coins" has considerable comedic satirical power: the poor old man Ahamed and his family go to town for shopping and are subjected to all kinds of difficulties and extortion by landlords and merchants; but he not only cleverly protects his only four small coins, but also makes them look ridiculous. The film has beautiful composition, the characters' movements are flexible and natural, and the kindness, wit, and humor of old Ahamed, and the greed and ignorance of the landlords and merchants are also vividly expressed.

    舞台和银幕
    群魔乱舞　丑态毕露
    新中山狼　日内演出
    上海市通俗话剧巡回演出团发挥了通俗话剧的特点，用新编的时事新戏“新中山狼”，参加反右派斗争。这个戏日内即将在首都的舞台上演了。
    这出戏揭露了右派分子在全国解放前夕，就图谋趁中国人民解放军尚未渡江南下时，掌握一部分军事力量，组成第三条路线和共产党对抗；以及想利用美国的经济援助在人民政府中获得要职的阴谋。同时，也揭发了右派野心家们想趁共产党整风的机会，命令喽啰走卒，全力向科学、教育、文艺等方面猖狂进攻的诡计。在这里你可以看到右派野心家们的狠毒嘴脸和丑恶灵魂。（兰）
    布谷鸟叫到北京舞台
    北京人民艺术剧院今晚开始演出的“布谷鸟又叫了”，是反映现实农村青年爱情生活的一出别具喜剧风格的好戏。这个戏在江南一带演出，深获观众好评。
    作者是以年青、活泼的姑娘“布谷鸟”爱情生活的波折为主线，从童亚花、雷大汗和郭家林、石秀娥两对夫妇关系的鲜明对比和复杂的纠葛中，多方面显示出人们之间新的关系。整个戏就像年青的姑娘“布谷鸟”一样，是充满着青春、活泼、愉快、明朗的一支歌。
    人物性格的真实生动、生活般轻松愉快的喜剧风格，是这出戏的显著特色。
                                  （春笛）
    夫妻有矛盾　白旗起风波
    “小白旗的风波”是根据吉学霈的同名短篇小说改编的。影片通过一对青年夫妻的美好而又充满矛盾的生活，揭示出人们随着新制度的建立而成长起来的新品质，新感情，抨击了封建制度所留给人们的夫权思想的残余。这新与旧的思想的矛盾，构成了影片的戏剧冲突。影片中的那些有趣的喜剧场面，处理得很好，不仅和整个的剧情极为融洽，同时使人感到，作者对那些善良而缺点的人们的批判，做得极有分寸感，并不过分。感到不足的是，故事还嫌单调一些，对人物的挖掘也还嫌不够。　（矢）
      “四个小钱”妙趣横生
    苏联彩色木偶片“四个小钱”，颇有喜剧的讽刺力量：穷老汉阿哈默德一家进城逛街，受到地主、商人的百般刁难与讹诈；但是他不仅机智地保住了仅有的四个小钱，还让他们出足了洋相。影片画面构图优美，人物的动作灵活自然，老阿哈默德的善良、机智与诙谐，和地主商人的贪婪、愚昧也得到了生动的表现。　（天）
