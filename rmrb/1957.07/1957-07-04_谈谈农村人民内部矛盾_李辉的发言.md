I wholeheartedly support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at this meeting.

From the vivid facts and figures pointed out in the reports, it can be seen that 1956 was a year of great victory for the Chinese people on the road to building a happy life. Industrial construction in 1956 developed the fastest and achieved the greatest results since liberation. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce achieved overall victory. In this year, our country underwent a fundamental change. This was a major political change, as well as a major change in the economic base and the people's lives, and it was the most extensive, profound, and complex major change in human history, a world-shaking change. Shanxi Province also underwent fundamental changes along with the country's changes. Ninety-nine point eight percent of farmers in the province joined agricultural production cooperatives, 99 percent of handicraft laborers joined handicraft production cooperatives, and 94.5 percent of capitalist industry and commerce implemented joint state-private ownership. In the high tide of socialist transformation, the scale and achievements of production were also unprecedented. In the first year of cooperation, although areas with 2 million people in our province suffered major disasters, the total grain output still exceeded the highest historical output in 1953 by 3.5%, and cotton exceeded the highest annual output in 1952 by 10%. In terms of industrial production, the total output value of state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private enterprises exceeded that of 1955 by 30%. The great achievements made by the people of our province in 1956 also fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. This huge change and achievement is ironclad evidence that once again proves that the Chinese revolution must be led by the Communist Party to achieve victory.

Farmers are Determined to Take the Socialist Road
Rightists' Malicious Attempts Have Failed

I am a local cadre working in southern Shanxi, and I would like to focus on the specific situation of internal contradictions among rural people and offer a few suggestions.

The high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in 1956 brought boundless joy and hope to the 500 million farmers and the people of the whole country, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm for rural construction. The masses said: "Advanced cooperation is really good, distribution according to work is truly fair, the exploitation system is completely abolished, and labor is completely liberated." "Everyone has food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, colorful bedding is very common, thermos bottles and rain boots are really practical. If it weren't for agricultural cooperation, where would we have such a good life? People have conscience and trees have roots; it is the Communist Party that has led us to turn ourselves around." The people deeply realized that the socialist road is a great road to a happy life, and only the socialist system can lead the people from happiness to happiness. The people have also experienced from many years of life that only the Communist Party can lead the people to build socialism and lead the people to achieve complete liberation. The superiority of cooperation and the issue of the socialist direction have already been resolved in the countryside.

Of course, rural work cannot be without problems. The main problem now is that the leadership is not keeping up, and they are not good at handling or handling properly the new problems that have arisen after cooperation, which has caused dissatisfaction among some of the masses. Some people have taken this opportunity to shout, as if the socialist road has gone wrong, as if the peasants do not support socialism. This is an extremely wrong statement. The reality is not like that. I will now use concrete facts to illustrate this problem. According to our investigation of four agricultural cooperatives in Wenxi and Xiaxian counties, the four cooperatives have a total of 1,655 households, and 160 households are dissatisfied with the cooperative, accounting for 9.67% of the total number of households. Among them, 103 households are upper-middle peasants, accounting for 64.38% of the dissatisfied households, and 14 households are former landlords and rich peasants, accounting for 8.74% of the dissatisfied households. It can be seen that most of the less than one-tenth of dissatisfied households in rural areas are still landlords, rich peasants, and upper-middle peasants. Moreover, the dissatisfied households are not dissatisfied with everything the cooperative leadership does. They said that they have three satisfactions and one dissatisfaction with the Party and government leadership. First, they are satisfied that cadres have been sent down to strengthen grassroots leadership; second, they are satisfied that long-term refunds and short-term supplements have been used to clear up finances and implement the distribution policy of more pay for more work; third, they are satisfied with contracting work to teams and assigning output quotas with rewards for overproduction. What they are dissatisfied with is that cadres issue compulsory orders and are not realistic enough. The masses welcome strengthened leadership, which is a demand to consolidate the socialist organization of agriculture; the masses welcome the system of distribution according to work, which is to support the socialist principle; the masses welcome centralized leadership and appropriately decentralized management methods, which is to support democratic centralism; the masses are dissatisfied with compulsory orders and demand a democratic style, which is to strengthen unity within the people. These demands and wishes of the masses are correct, analytical, and critical, not indiscriminate. Rightists attack the Party and oppose the socialist direction in the name of the masses. Their malicious attempts are doomed to failure. It is the rightists who are bound to fail, and it will never be socialism. They claim to represent the masses, but in reality, they are running counter to the demands and wishes of the masses.

Three Current Contradictions in Rural Areas

Based on what I have learned from going to the countryside, inspections, and daily work this spring, the main contradictions in rural areas are three major issues: demands for splitting up cooperatives, demands for grain, and problems with cadres' work style.

                Splitting Up Cooperatives

During the high tide of cooperation, some agricultural cooperatives were too large. The economic conditions within some joint-village cooperatives and large cooperatives varied greatly: natural conditions differed significantly, living habits were different, and there were other special economic factors, such as fruit trees, vegetables, reed ponds, and other sideline production. These complex problems are not easily solved well in a short period of time. Therefore, generally speaking, the size of cooperatives should be slightly smaller at present. Joint cooperatives with more problems should be appropriately decentralized.

                Grain Problem

The grain problem, on the one hand, is that in most cases where there is enough to eat reasonably, there are indeed individual cases where there is not enough to eat. Such as the problem of large mouths and small mouths, the problem of strong labor and weak labor, the problem of debtors, the problem of inaccurate output figures when individual cooperatives purchase grain, and the fact that after last year's bumper harvest and the opening of the free market, some farmers developed a wasteful habit, and so on. But the main thing is ideological demands for grain. For example, in the Xiong Yan Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County, everyone initially clamored that 420 kilograms of grain was not enough to eat. They said, "This is the standard for state personnel." "They have money and can buy eggs to eat when they are hungry." "Ask them to go to the field to carry soil, and give them half a jin of grain when they come back, and see if it's enough for them." "Tomorrow, ask the staff to eat at my house. If he eats three steamed buns, I'll eat six. If he eats four, I'll eat eight. I guarantee that one person will be worth two of him." It seems like a fierce quarrel, but after in-depth understanding, out of the 360 households in the entire cooperative, only 88 households requested grain, accounting for 24.4% of the total number of households in the cooperative. We also conducted a household-by-household investigation and specific analysis of these 88 households. Twenty-nine households requested grain in name only. Some of these households are "old households" who eat supply grain. They said, "You can't forget me. I had a share in eating supply grain every year." Some are dissatisfied with the fact that households with grain report a shortage of grain, so if you report it, I'll report it too. Twenty-one households were slightly short and could have had enough to eat with a little saving. Their reasons were that they had a "big belly" and ate a lot; that their children were in senior high school and ate a lot; that their married daughters often stayed at their parents' home; and so on. Five households were short of grain due to serious waste. They "eat what they grab and spend what they find." Nineteen households were making trouble without reason. Upper-middle peasant Liu Yinsheng's family of three was allotted 1,944 jin of wheat alone. Including other miscellaneous grains, each person averaged 870 jin, and they still demanded "a grain of rice" from the state. Only 14 households were truly short of grain. Some of them were all large mouths and ate relatively more. Some borrowed grain from others last year, and after returning it, they were a little short. After these situations were presented to the masses in the whole village and the whole cooperative, the conclusion reached after discussion was: "We don't lack anything else, we just lack patriotic ideas and socialist consciousness." After discussion, many households that wanted grain no longer wanted it. For the few households that were truly short, most of them were resolved by the production teams themselves. Therefore, we say that the grain problem is mainly an ideological problem.

That is to say, there is a contradiction between the current reality that national grain production cannot allow every household to have reserve grain and the ideological situation in which farmers are not accustomed to the system of planned distribution of rations. Moreover, the cooperative and township cadres lack detailed analysis and research when dealing with specific problems, and they do not distinguish between right and wrong. They often procrastinate and do not solve problems at the beginning. When problems accumulate, they solve them blindly, responding to every request. In this way, individual grain shortage problems, or even cases where there is no shortage of grain, become grain shortage incidents. For example, in the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaxian County, the cooperative cadres first bought grain from the cooperative's reserve grain, which caused ideological tension among the cooperative members. However, the deputy director did not distinguish between true and false. Whoever came to the cooperative to ask for grain urgently, he gave them eight jin for every ten jin, and quickly released 45,000 jin of reserve grain. The number of people asking for grain increased, and a large number of people went to the township People's Committee to demand grain, forming a grain shortage incident.

            Cadre Work Style Problems

Whether it is the issue of splitting up cooperatives, the issue of grain shortages, or other issues, the direct cause of the trouble stems from problems with the cadre's work style. For example, in the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Shangniu Village, Hejin County, the fundamental reason for the trouble was the wide disparity in economic conditions, but the incident was caused by the fact that the general cooperative was located in Beiyang and did not sufficiently respect the opinions of the masses in Shangniu Village. The masses in Shangniu had doubts about the accounts, but instead of patiently explaining, the cadres took repressive and retaliatory measures. The cooperative cadres said at the Shangniu mass meeting: "The Dengta Cooperative is a cooperative of more than 3,000 people, not a cooperative of a few work recorders in Shangniu. Your careless checking of accounts is a violation of policy." The township head said to Zhang Xilong, who had raised opinions: "The cooperative members in Shangniu Village are a donkey's head pasted with three sheets of paper; what a big face (meaning that you cooperative members in Shangniu Village are nothing special)." The stationed cadre threatened Zhang Guizhong, a poor peasant who was making trouble to split up the cooperative, with harsh words: "You are an ungrateful new counter-revolutionary!" This made the matter worse, and they were determined to split up the cooperative. This fact shows that the democratic work style of some township and cooperative cadres is still insufficient. Problems that could be solved were not solved reasonably, so that small problems became big problems. Because grassroots cadres do not clearly understand the distinction between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, they cannot quickly grasp the principle of correctly resolving contradictions among the people. They said: "We work hard to serve the people. We are not as good as the county and district cadres above, and we live a harder life than the cooperative members below. Instead, we are said to be bureaucratic. We really can't figure it out." Some said: "I admit that there are contradictions with the enemy, but I can't understand the contradictions among the people." Some said: "Contradictions are not terrible. We had them in the past, and they were solved with a struggle, weren't they?" Therefore, it is very important and crucial to implement the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people among cadres at the township and cooperative levels. But this is an issue that must be educated over a relatively long period of time. We must treat them patiently, and being impatient will not work. Another issue worth noting is that there are sectarian tendencies in some leadership aspects. They lack investigation and education for the original cadres and trust them blindly, while blindly reject the opinions of the masses without analysis. This fuels the erroneous emotions of the township and cooperative cadres and hinders the development of democracy in rural areas. This is the main reason why the problems among the people in some places cannot be correctly resolved.

Internal contradictions among the people should be resolved by correctly handling production issues

The main reason why people are causing trouble is the problem between the state and the cooperative, between teams, and between the cooperative and its members, that is, it is concentrated on the issue of distribution and the issue of leadership. But the basis for solving the distribution problem and the leadership problem is the production problem. We must solve the internal contradictions among the people through the issue of production, and promote the development of production by solving the internal contradictions among the people. Judging from the current production situation in the Jinan Special Zone, there are the following major contradictory problems that I think should be given great attention.

First, this year's cotton field sowing, labor organization, and fertilization all exceeded previous years, and the rainfall was also timely, but the seedling emergence situation is not satisfactory. The main reason is poor technical guidance. Of course, it is the correct direction to give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the cooperative members, but agricultural cooperatives are different from ordinary small farmers. If there is a lack of specific guidance, the general cooperative members are not concerned enough about technical measures. This shows that the contradiction between advanced agricultural science and technology and the traditional experience of farmers is still an important problem that has not been well resolved. Here, on the one hand, we must resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward among the farmers, and on the other hand, we must resolve the contradiction between the scientific attitude and dogmatism on the leadership side. Secondly, we must also resolve the contradiction between economic leadership, political leadership, and technical leadership. This problem mainly manifested itself in subjectivism and commandism last year. This year, due to the emergence of the argument that all past achievements in technical guidance should be negated, and the tendency that production does not need leadership and technology does not need leadership, it has deviated to the other side. Our organization and leadership of agricultural technology reform is still lagging behind the development of objective conditions. Local leaders do not pay enough attention to studying and mastering technology and systematically and step by step improving agricultural production technology. Therefore, I think that a comprehensive arrangement should be made for agricultural technology policies. There can be two ways to guide technical work: one is to establish a strong technical organization that is closely linked to agricultural cooperatives under the close leadership of the Party and government to strengthen technical experiments, investigations, and guidance work. This organization provides strong technical support to agricultural cooperatives. This method is very good, but at present, our technical strength is weak and it is difficult to do. The second method is to make the study and mastery of technology a central task of the local Party and government leadership, and the Party and government directly grasp the technical work. It is best to organize Party and government leaders to systematically study technology through various forms, so that they can delve into it and become experts. This is the key issue for the entire technological reform and needs to be resolved urgently.

Second, the processing of wheat fields this year also exceeded previous years, and the wheat growth is generally good, but it is estimated that the total output will be lower than last year. The main reason is that the area of multiple cropping last year was large, and it was not completely returned to the team. The ones that were returned to the team did not grow well enough. Therefore, the masses and lower-level cadres have shaken their faith in expanding the area of multiple cropping and reforming the cropping system. The issue of reforming the cropping system is indeed a major issue with long-term impact. Only by systematically reforming the cropping system can we fully utilize the superiority of collective management and achieve the goal of increasing the yield per unit area. However, the actual conditions of agricultural production cannot keep up. Water, fertilizer, and technical conditions cannot keep up. The result of expanding the multiple cropping index last year played a major role in increasing grain production that year, but it has brought problems this year. Therefore, the reform of the cropping system requires careful investigation and research and should be gradually promoted in a planned manner. It should not be carried out blindly and suddenly. The main key should be to vigorously grasp specific measures such as water, fertilizer, seeds, technology, and crop rotation while promoting the reform of the cropping system. This requires a comprehensive plan and close cooperation between the water conservancy, animal husbandry, and technology departments under a unified plan. It is not possible to isolate and grasp measures such as water, fertilizer, and technology while accommodating the habits of the small-scale peasant economy and ignoring the major issue of reforming the cropping system. On the other hand, it is also bound to fail to overemphasize the reform of the cropping system, thinking that the reform of the system will solve all problems, and ignoring the solution of specific problems and carrying out reforms blindly.

Third, the oil extraction industry has always been a major sideline occupation for farmers in southern Shanxi, and oil cake is the main feed and fertilizer in rural areas. In recent years, the state has opened mechanical oil extraction factories, and supply and marketing cooperatives have opened semi-mechanical oil extraction factories. The annual processing capacity only accounts for 16.56% of the total processing capacity in the entire region. Although the number is not large, there are many opinions from the masses: first, the round-trip transportation costs for purchasing and selling have increased; second, time and animal power have been wasted, and raw materials and cotton cake often cannot be supplied on time; third, 80% of the skins, cakes, and residues are used as feed and fertilizer when farmers extract oil themselves, but after transportation and processing, it is difficult to meet the needs of the original sales units, which greatly reduces the source of feed and fertilizer; fourth, it reduces rural sideline occupations. This policy issue has been debated for two years, but it has never been resolved reasonably. I think that in the future, the oil extraction business in general rural areas can be run by farmers themselves, and the oil can be purchased and sold by the state. This can save state funds and solve the problem of combining agriculture and sideline occupations.

Finally, there is another major issue, that is, after the implementation of contracting work to teams and assigning output quotas, the issue of women in agricultural cooperatives has become prominent. Many production teams are afraid that women's work quality is low, wasting work, and reducing output, so they do not assign work to women and do not implement equal pay for equal work. However, cooperation has improved women's economic status in the family and society and strengthened women's organization and unity, which has also inspired women's urgent demand to fight for political status. In this way, the contradiction between women and agricultural cooperatives has become acute, which is also a new phenomenon in rural areas this spring. Therefore, women said: "Chairman Mao called for high yields, but the team does not give women work to do." Some agricultural cooperatives had groups of women asking the director for work every day. This shows that women have formed an independent social force in rural areas, and it is no longer possible to disrespect their due rights. However, some rural organizations still discriminate against women and have old small-scale peasant economic and feudal views. In this way, a series of issues, from equal pay for equal work and labor arrangements to respecting women's democratic rights, technical education for women, and training of women cadres, have become an important policy issue in the current socialist construction in rural areas.

Facts show that after advanced cooperation, many new problems have emerged in women's work in rural areas, which have an important impact on the development of production. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen women's work in rural areas.

The above issues are some of the important specific issues of the current internal contradictions among the rural people. Please criticize and correct my personal opinions if they are not correct. (Attached photo)

    谈谈农村人民内部矛盾
    李辉的发言
    我衷心地拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长在这次会议上所作的报告。
    从报告所指出的活生生的事实和数字中就可以看出，1956年是我国人民在建设幸福生活的道路上取得伟大胜利的一年。工业建设在1956年是解放以来发展最快、成绩最大的一年。农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造得到了全面的胜利。在这一年里我们国家起了一个根本的变化。这是政治上的大变化，也是经济基础上、人民生活上的大变化，而且是人类历史上最广泛、最深刻、最复杂的大变化，是翻天复地的大变化。我们山西省随着国家的变化也起了根本的变化。全省百分之九十九点八的农户加入了农业生产合作社，百分之九十九的手工业劳动者加入了手工业生产合作社，百分之九十四点五的资本主义工商业实行了公私合营。在社会主义改造的高潮中，生产的规模和成绩也是空前的。在合作化的第一年，我省虽有二百万人口的地区受到重大灾害，但是粮食总产量还超过历史上产量最高的1953年的3.5％，棉花超过最高年产量1952年的10％；在工业生产方面，国营、地方国营、公私合营的总产值超过了1955年的30％。我省人民在1956年所取得的这些伟大成绩也充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。这个巨大的变化和成绩是铁的证据，又一次证明了中国革命一定要共产党来领导才能取得胜利。
    农民坚决走社会主义道路
    右派分子恶毒企图落了空
    我是晋南地方工作干部，我想着重谈一谈农村人民内部矛盾的具体情况并提出几点建议。
    1956年农业合作化运动的高潮给五亿农民也给全国人民带来了无限的喜悦和希望，大大地鼓舞了农村建设的积极性。群众说：“高级合作真正好，按劳取酬真公道，完全取消剥削制，劳力彻底解放了。”“人人有饭吃，人人有衣穿，花花被褥很普通，暖壶雨鞋真适用，不是农业合作化，哪有这样的好光景？人有良心树有根，是共产党领导咱们翻的身。”人民深刻体会到社会主义的道路是求幸福生活的大道，只有社会主义制度才能使人民从幸福走向幸福。人民从多年的生活中也体验到只有共产党才能领导人民建设社会主义，才能领导人民得到彻底解放。合作化的优越性，社会主义方向问题在农村已经解决了。
    当然农村工作也不可能没有问题。现在主要的问题是领导赶不上去，对合作化后产生的新问题还不善于处理或处理的不妥当，引起了部分群众的不满。一些人就借此叫喊起来，好像是社会主义道路走错了，好像农民不拥护社会主义似的。这是极端错误的说法。实际并不是这样的。我现在用具体事实来说明这个问题。根据我们在闻喜和夏县四个农业社的调查，四社共有一千六百五十五户，对社不满的一百六十户，占总户数的百分之九点六七。其中上中农一百零三户，占不满户数的百分之六十四点三八，原来的地主富农十四户，占不满户数的百分之八点七四，可见农村不足十分之一的不满户也还多半是地富和上中农。而且不满户对合作社的领导也不是不满一切，他们说：他们对党政领导有三满意一不满意。一满意干部下放，加强了基层领导；二满意长退短补，清理财务，贯彻了多劳多得的分配政策；三满意包工包产，超产奖励。不满意的是干部强迫命令，实事求是差。群众欢迎加强领导，这就是要求巩固农业的社会主义组织；群众欢迎按劳取酬的制度，这就是拥护社会主义的原则；群众欢迎集中领导和适当分散的管理方法，这就是拥护民主集中制；群众不满意强迫命令，要求民主作风，这就是要求加强人民内部的团结。群众的这些要求和愿望都是正确的，有分析有批判的，并不是不分是非的。右派分子借群众的名义攻击党，反对社会主义方向。他们这种恶毒企图是落空了。必然遭到失败的是右派分子，而绝不会是社会主义。他们口口声声代表群众，实际上正是与群众的要求和愿望背道而驰的。
    目前农村中的三个矛盾
    根据我春季下乡、视察和日常工作中所了解，目前农村主要矛盾是闹分社、闹粮、闹干部作风三大问题。
                分社问题
    合作化高潮中有些农业社的规模偏大。某些联村社和大社内部的经济条件差别很大：自然条件悬殊，生活习惯不同，还有其他特殊的经济因素，例如果木、蔬菜、苇塘及其他副业生产等。这些复杂的问题在短期内还不易得到很好的解决。因此目前社的规模一般地说还是稍小点好。问题较多的联社应该适当地分散。
                粮食问题
    闹粮问题，一方面，在绝大部分合理够吃的情况下，的确有个别不够吃的现象。如大口和小口的问题，劳力强和劳力弱的问题，欠款户的问题，个别社在统购时产量数字不确的问题，以及去年丰收和自由市场开放后，部分农民滋长了浪费风气等等。但主要的是思想闹粮。如洪赵县熊焰农业社，开始都吵着四百二十斤粮食不够吃。说什么：“这是国家人员的标准”“他们有钱饿了可以买鸡蛋吃”“叫他们下地担土，回来给他半斤粮，看他够吃不够吃。”“明天叫工作人员到我家里吃饭，他吃三个馍我吃六个，他吃四个我吃八个，保管一人顶他两。”看来吵的很凶，但是经过深入了解，全社三百六十户，提出要粮的只有八十八户，占全社总户数的百分之二十四点四。我们对这八十八户又作了逐户调查，具体分析。挂名要粮的二十九户，这些户有的是吃供应粮的“老户”，他们说“不能把我忘了，那一年吃供应粮都有我的份。”有的对有粮户报缺粮不满，你报我也报。稍缺一点，稍节省一下就可以够吃的有二十一户，他们的理由是“肚子大”吃的多；是什么孩子上高小吃的多啦，出嫁闺女常住娘家啦，等等。由于严重浪费而造成缺粮的五户，他们是“抓到就吃，摸到就花。”本来有粮无理取闹的十九户，上中农刘银生，全家三口人，光小麦就分得一千九百四十四斤，连其他杂粮每人平均八百七十斤，还提出“缺颗米”向国家要粮。真正缺一些粮的只有十四户。这里边有的全是大口，吃的确实比较多些；有的是在去年就借了别人的粮，归还之后自己有些短缺。这些情况在全村全社群众中摆开，大家讨论后得出的结论是：“咱们别的不缺，就是缺点爱国思想，缺点社会主义觉悟。”经过讨论，好多要粮的户不要粮了，对几户真正缺些的，大都经过各生产队自己解决了。因此我们说闹粮问题主要是思想问题。
    这就是说当前国家粮食生产还不能使每户都有储备粮的实际情况和农民对有计划地分配口粮的制度不习惯的思想情况之间存在着矛盾。而社干部乡干部处理具体问题又缺乏细致的分析和调查研究，没有分清是非，往往开始拖拉不解决问题，等到问题积多了，又有求必应盲目解决，这样，就使得个别缺粮问题甚至于并不缺粮变成了闹粮事件。例如夏县团结农业社，由于社干首先在社的储备粮内买了粮食，引起社员思想紧张。但副社长不分真假，谁到社里要的紧，要十斤给八斤，很快就把四万五千斤储备粮放完了，要粮的人却越来越多，大批的到乡人民委员会去闹粮，形成闹粮事件。
            干部作风问题
    不论是闹分社还是闹粮或其他问题，闹事的直接原因都是从干部作风问题上引起的。例如河津县上牛村灯塔农业社，闹事的根本原因是经济条件悬殊，但事件的起因却是由于总社设在北阳，对上牛村群众意见不够尊重。上牛群众对账目有怀疑，干部不但没有耐心的进行解释，反而采取了压制和打击的方法。社干部在上牛群众大会上说：“灯塔社是三千多口人的社，不是上牛几个记工员的社，你马马虎虎查账是违犯政策的行为。”乡长对提意见的张喜龙说：“上牛村的社员是三张纸糊下的一颗驴头，好大的脸面（意思是你上牛村社员有什么了不起）。”驻社干部用大话威胁闹分社的贫农张贵忠说：“你是忘恩负义的新反革命分子！这样事情就闹大了，坚决要分社。这个事实说明我们有些乡干部和社干部的民主作风还是很不够的。能够解决的问题没有合理解决，以致小事闹成大事。基层干部因为对敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区别认识不清，因而对正确解决人民内部矛盾的原则还不能迅速掌握。他们说：“辛辛苦苦为人民服务，上比县区干部不如，下比社员生活苦，反而说成官僚主义，真是想不通。”有的说：“和敌人有矛盾我承认，人民中有矛盾我想不通。”有的说：“矛盾也不可怕，过去有过，一斗不就解决了吗？”所以在乡社两级干部中贯彻正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题是非常重要的关键问题。但这又是必须用比较长一点的时间进行教育的问题。要耐心地对待他们，性急是不行的。还有一个值得注意的问题是在某些领导方面有宗派主义情绪，对于原有的干部缺乏考察和教育，盲目信任，而对群众意见则不加分析地盲目排斥。这就助长了乡社干部的错误情绪，阻碍了农村民主的发扬。这就是某些地方人民中的问题还不能正确地解决的主要原因。
    人民内部矛盾要通过正确处理生产问题来解决
    人民闹事的主要原因是国家与社，队与队，社和社员的问题，就是说集中在分配问题与领导问题上。但是解决分配问题与领导问题的基础是生产问题。必须通过生产问题来解决人民内部的矛盾，并通过解决人民内部矛盾问题来推动生产的发展。从晋南专区当前生产情况看来，有下面几个主要的矛盾问题，我认为应当十分重视。
    第一、今年棉田播种，劳力组织和施肥都超过往年，雨水也适时，但是出苗情况不够满意。主要原因是技术指导差。固然发挥社员的积极性主动性是正确的方向，但是农业社不同于一般的小农户，如果缺乏具体的指导，一般社员对技术措施是不够关心的。这说明先进的农业科学技术和农民的传统经验之间的矛盾还是个没有很好地解决了的重要问题。这里一方面要解决农民中先进与落后的矛盾，另一方面要解决领导方面科学态度和教条主义的矛盾，其次还要解决经济领导、政治领导和技术领导相结合的矛盾。这个问题在去年主要表现为主观主义和命令主义。而今年由于出现了否定过去一切技术指导成绩的论调，和生产不要领导、技术不要领导的倾向，又偏到了另一面。我们的农业技术改革的组织和领导还落后于客观情况的发展。地方领导对于研究和掌握技术，有系统有步骤地提高农业生产技术还不够重视。因此我认为应当对农业的技术政策作一个通盘的安排。在技术指导的方针上可以有两种办法：一种是，建立起一套强有力的技术机构，在党政密切的领导下与农业社紧紧联系着加强技术实验、调查与指导工作。通过这个组织给农业社以强大的技术支援。这个方法很好，但是目前我们技术力量薄弱，难以办到。第二种办法，就是把研究技术和掌握技术作为地方党政领导的一项中心任务，党政直接抓技术工作。最好能通过各种形式，组织党政领导人员有系统的学习技术，使之钻进去成为内行。这是整个技术改革的关键问题，迫切需要加以解决。
    第二、今年的麦田加工也超过了往年，麦子生长一般良好，但估计总产量会低于去年。主要是去年复种面积大，未能完全归队，归了队的也生长不够良好。因此群众和下层干部对扩大复种面积，改革耕作制度发生了动摇。耕作制度的改革问题，的确是一个有长远影响的大问题，只有有系统地改革耕作制度，才能充分发挥集体经营的优越性，达到提高单位面积产量的目标。但农业生产的现实条件又跟不上去。水、肥、技术条件跟不上去。去年扩大复种指数的结果，对当年粮食增产起了很大作用，却给今年带来了问题。因此耕作制度的改革需要进行慎重的调查研究，宜于有计划地逐步推广，不宜于盲目地突然地进行。主要的关键应该是在推行耕作制度改革的同时，大力抓住水、肥、种子、技术、轮作等具体措施。这就必须要有通盘的计划，和在统一计划下水利、畜牧、技术各部门密切协作。迁就小农经济的习惯，忽视耕作制度的改革这样一个大问题，孤立地抓水、肥、技术等等措施是不行的。另一方面，过分强调耕作制度的改革，以为制度的改革就解决了一切问题，而忽视具体问题的解决，盲目进行改革，也必然要失败的。
    第三、榨油事业向来是晋南农民的一种主要副业，而油饼又是农村主要的饲料和肥料。近几年来国家开设了机械榨油厂，供销社开设了半机械榨油厂。年加工能力只占全区加工能力的百分之十六点五六。虽然为数不多，群众意见却不少：一是由于购进售出往返运费成本提高；二是浪费了时间，浪费了劳畜力，往往不能按时供应原料和棉饼；三是农民自榨油时百分之八十左右的皮、饼、渣用作饲料和肥料，而调运加工后很难满足原来出售单位的需要，这就大大减少了饲料和肥料的来源；四是减少了农村副业。这一方针问题两年来一直在争论，但始终得不到合理解决。我认为，今后一般农村榨油事业可由农民自办，油可由国家统购统销。这样既能节省国家资金又能解决农业与副业相结合的问题。
    最后还有一个重大问题，即实行包工包产以后，农业社内妇女的问题突出了起来。许多生产队，怕妇女作活质量低浪费了工，减少了产量，不给妇女派活，不实行同工同酬。可是合作化提高了妇女在家庭和社会上的经济地位，加强了妇女的组织性和团结力量，因而也就启发了妇女争取政治地位的迫切要求。这样，妇女和农业社之间的矛盾就尖锐化起来，这也是今春农村的一个新现象。因此妇女们说：“毛主席号召要丰产，队里不给妇女活干。”有的农业社曾经每天有成群的妇女向社长要活干。这就说明妇女在农村已经形成了一支独立的社会力量，不尊重她们应有的权利，已经是不行了。但是有些农村组织还存在着对妇女的歧视，存在着旧的小农经济的和封建的观点。这样，从同工同酬、劳力安排，直到尊重妇女的民主权利、对妇女的技术教育、对妇女干部的培养等一系列问题就成为当前农村社会主义建设中一项重要的政策问题。
    事实说明，高级合作化后，农村的妇女工作出现了许多新的问题，对生产的发展有着重要的影响，因此需要加强农村的妇女工作。
    以上这些问题，都是当前农村人民内部矛盾的几个重要的具体问题，我个人的意见是否正确，请予以批评指正。（附图片）
