Today, I am a sinner who has committed serious political errors. I am grateful for the leniency of all the representatives, standing before you and allowed to use a few minutes to express my attitude of admitting my mistakes, bowing my head in repentance, and making the greatest determination to transform myself. Premier Zhou instructed in his Government Work Report that as long as "through external impetus, life experiences, and self-awareness, rightists can suddenly realize their errors, accept transformation, the door of socialist transformation is open to them." At this continuous conference and various group meetings, especially at the Anhui representative group meeting, the representatives' condemnation and exposure of my ugly and absurd words and deeds have been fully revealed, and I express my heartfelt acceptance and gratitude. Since the people of the whole country pointed out my serious errors and wrongdoings, enemies of our country, such as imperialists, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, and a few counter-revolutionaries lurking in the country, have been gleefully using the reactionary words and deeds of us rightists as propaganda tools, attempting to undermine the prestige of our great motherland, which makes me feel extremely sad and feel that my crimes are even more serious. "Those close to me are saddened, and my enemies are pleased." Therefore, I deeply feel that the criticism and exposure of me by the people of the whole country and all the representatives is precisely to carry out rescue work on me, not to let me completely sink, but to give me a chance for rebirth. Here, I want to once again express my heartfelt thanks to the people of the whole country and all the representatives!

My erroneous thoughts and crimes have historical roots, a reactionary class nature, and consistency. I came from a landlord family and have long been influenced by feudal ideas (the Tongcheng School) and bourgeois education. After I betrayed the glorious Chinese Communist Party in 1927, I degenerated into the leading figure of the middle-of-the-road line of "three parts anti-communist, seven parts anti-Chiang," forming the so-called Third Party—the predecessor of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. I specialized in political and military speculation, acting whenever there was an opportunity and stopping when there was no opportunity. Such right-leaning opportunist speculative thinking was retained until after the great revolutionary victory of the Chinese people. On July 1, 1951, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party, although I published an article of "Self-Criticism that the Communist Party Saved Me," expressing my repentance, I still did not completely dig out the roots of bad thoughts. Therefore, my position was unstable, sometimes "left," sometimes right, sometimes cold, sometimes hot, often showing a two-faced style, very nostalgic for the old things, only superficially accepting the new things, but actually keeping a distance. This lurking bad thought re-emerged after the 20th Congress of the CPSU criticized Stalin's personality cult in 1956. I made excessive and malicious criticisms of Stalin, sometimes giving too low an evaluation of the achievements of the great socialist construction of the Soviet Union, and sometimes emphasizing its shortcomings. Also, because of the influence of anti-dogmatism, I even disregarded the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and never seriously studied them, which formed the so-called revisionist thinking of anti-Marxism-Leninism. This new bad thought is in the same vein as my past right-leaning opportunist thinking. Its danger is the danger of serving the bourgeoisie, as Chairman Mao pointed out, it is: "opposing or attempting to weaken the people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party, opposing or attempting to weaken socialist transformation and socialist construction." Not only that, but my bad thoughts also stole a sentence from the report of Malenkov at the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), roughly meaning that "the bourgeoisie can no longer grasp the banner of democratic freedom, and the working class must grasp it." Therefore, in my speech at the plenary session of the CPPCC this year, there were these two sentences: "I love socialism, and I also love democracy." Obviously, I mistakenly believed that socialism and democracy are opposing things. This major erroneous thought is precisely the point that "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" severely refutes. In addition, I absurdly regarded the science and technology and "democratic way of life" of capitalist countries as having their vitality. I mistakenly thought that as long as we have socialism plus science and technology and "democracy," our country's life will be more complete. Since last year, I have often promoted this set of fallacies, which is actually bourgeois right-wing thinking with a revisionist signboard, to people in many private talks and large and small meetings. This poison has harmed many people. The right-wing elements in the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party naturally cater to it, and some progressive elements have also been poisoned unconsciously. This is my sin.

Under the guidance of such vicious anti-socialist and anti-people bourgeois right-wing thinking, the serious errors and wrongdoings that I have committed in the past year or so, especially during the period of helping the Party's rectification movement, are unforgivable.

In 1956, I proposed to regard the CPPCC as a "Senate," which is a disguised form of bourgeois democratic parliament. The purpose is to expand my so-called "democracy" so that I can do something in this situation, and so that non-Party democratic people can also do something. At the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China this year, I again mistakenly proposed a "political design institute," advocating more research on the country's policies and guidelines, and strengthening the rights of democratic parties. I regarded the CPPCC, democratic parties, and people's organizations as having the same status as the National People's Congress. This is an unadulterated attempt to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat and the system of the National People's Congress with bourgeois democracy. This is a proposition that violates the Constitution and will inevitably lead to the restoration of capitalism against the Party and against the people.

Not only that, since the Party Central Committee proposed "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and Chairman Mao's correct handling of the problem of contradictions among the people, I have distorted them according to my subjective wishes, especially emphasizing the supervisory role of democratic parties, and mistakenly believing that the socialist revolution has basically been completed and the class struggle has basically ended. All strata, especially middle and upper-level intellectuals, have made some progress and can be developed with confidence. Until recently, when the CCP proposed rectification and asked the democratic parties to help with rectification, I emphasized the development of organizations even more. I believe that each democratic party can develop hundreds of thousands of people, and several democratic parties together can develop one to two million people. I also advocated that democratic parties can develop organizations to the county level, and each democratic party can agree to develop by county. I also said that after the socialist revolution is basically completed, the nature and tasks of the democratic parties should be re-evaluated, and the nature and tasks of the democratic parties should be raised a step. This absurd proposition is an attempt to expand the political power of the democratic parties and increase political capital to satisfy personal political desires. In fact, it is weakening the leadership of the Party and forming a situation of "separate courts" with the Party, which is most harmful to the Party.

Regarding the issue of the Zhang-Luo alliance, before 1956, I and Luo Longji had a struggle for personal rights. Since 1956, due to the consistency of ideological understanding, we have embarked on the dangerous path of the Zhang-Luo alliance today. The most basic factor in the combination of our alliance is that we both stand on the position of the bourgeoisie. My political proposition meets his requirements. Therefore, some senior intellectuals who were close to him and opposed me in the past also changed their past attitude of opposing me and agreed with me. Luo Longji constantly expressed to me: "Wherever you go, I will follow!" and proposed that Shen Lao of the China Democratic League be the honorary chairman, I can be the chairman, and he can be the first vice chairman, but I did not agree. Since last year, in the work of the China Democratic League, he supported my opinions. In the personnel arrangement of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, such as the work positions of Fei Xiaotong, Fan Puzhai, Pan Guangdan, Zeng Zhaolun, and Wu Jingchao, I satisfied Luo's wishes. Luo was in charge of propaganda, and I was in charge of culture and education in the China Democratic League's division of labor. The "Zhengming" monthly magazine was agreed to be led by him, and I did not interfere. In particular, he vigorously emphasized the issue of intellectuals in the China Democratic League and the CPPCC, and I supported him, even in the issue of his insistence on managing the cultural club, I also supported him.

Why did I compromise with Luo Longji? I wanted to gain a certain political influence among the major intellectuals in the China Democratic League, so I wanted to use Luo's relationship to make it easier for me to work among intellectuals. Major intellectuals in the League, such as Fei Xiaotong, Pan Dakui, Zeng Zhaolun, Wu Jingchao, Pan Guangdan, Hua Luogeng, Qian Duansheng, and Ma Zhemin, all had private relationships with Luo. Here, I needed to get Luo's support in order to achieve the purpose of influencing major intellectuals. Here, it can be said that from ideological resonance, it progressed to political alliance. We mutually utilized each other and complemented each other.

In early May of this year, when the CCP's rectification began, I arbitrarily convened Luo to jointly convene relevant leaders of the propaganda, culture and education, and organization departments to discuss the issue of establishing four group forums. This matter was not discussed with Vice Chairmen Shi and Gao in advance.

The four groups are:

(1) The "Long-term Coexistence, Mutual Supervision" and "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" Group.
(2) Scientific Planning Group.
(3) The Group with Positions but No Power.
(4) The Higher Education Party Committee System Group.

The purpose of organizing these four groups was to promote the bourgeoisie's democracy and science through a set of bourgeois views of major intellectuals, confusing the people's understanding of the superiority of socialism and the immovability of the Party's leadership. The consequences caused ideological confusion, making the conspiracy activities of a few right-wing senior intellectuals even more rampant and attacking the Party. For example, the opinions put forward by the Scientific Planning Group on several issues related to China's scientific system are as harmful to the Party's leadership of scientific work and the destruction of the planning and unity of scientific research work, as Vice Chairman Guo Moruo and Representative Pan Zinian have severely criticized. The other three groups, although they did not hold meetings to carry out work, had equally serious and bad political consequences.

On the afternoon of June 5th, three professors, namely Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and Fei Xiaotong, and Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, Hu Yuzhi, came to me to talk about the situation of the rectification movement in universities. The three professors unanimously believed that the situation was serious and a large parade could occur at any time. If handled improperly, if students unite with citizens, incidents similar to Hungary could also occur. They also said that although the situation was serious, they had a way to solve it, "it can be released and it can be taken back," but the Party committee had no way. I agreed with their view and decided to hold a meeting the next day, adding professors Huang Yaomian, Tao Dayong, and Wu Jingchao, and inviting Vice Chairman Shi, Standing Committee Member Min Ganghou, and Director Ye Duyi to talk together. The content of the conversation was roughly the same as the situation discussed the day before. I also agreed with their opinions at the time. This shows that I stood on the position of the bourgeois right wing, supporting an arrogant anti-Party conspiracy, attempting to replace the Party's leadership in universities with the China Democratic League.

After Chu Anping took office as editor-in-chief of Guangming Daily on April 1 this year, I appreciated him very much. I felt that he had a certain work ability, and his news views and ideological understanding coincided with mine. This unspoken consensus was reflected in the editorial policy of Guangming Daily during this period:

(1) Report more on the activities of democratic parties and the activities of individual democratic parties.
(2) Report more on the scientific and technological inventions of capitalist countries.
(3) Report more on the activities of social democratic parties in nationalist countries.

This kind of policy coincided with my set of bourgeois ideas, thus tampering with the editorial policy of Guangming Daily, as a mouthpiece for propagating bourgeois democracy. What is especially hateful is that I agreed to Chu Anping's sending reporters to nine major cities to organize forums, playing the role of setting fires everywhere and disrupting the Party's rectification movement. At the same time, Chu had more private relations with Luo, and Luo also gave some instructions on Chu's guiding Guangming Daily's policy. Therefore, the right-wing thoughts of Zhang, Luo, and Chu played a common role in Guangming Daily.

In the first half of this year, I encouraged Li Boqiu to engage in large-scale development in Beijing in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. After the rectification movement began, I also told him to organize forums. In the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party's Beijing Municipal Committee, in more than a month in May, a total of 21 forums were organized in the fields of medicine, health, engineering technology, agriculture, education, art, and Peking opera, with a total of more than 500 members and masses participating. Not only that, but during this period, I also sent Wang Yifan to the Northeast, Yang Yitang to Shandong, and Zhang Yunchuan to Henan and other places to develop organizations. My large-scale development plan was to influence science and technology medical and health personnel through the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, just as influencing university professors through the China Democratic League. The purpose was to obtain political capital and expand my political influence.

In addition, in order to expand my political influence inside and outside the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, since last year, the "Study Newsletter" was reorganized into the "Advance News," changing the past focus on reporting party affairs, reporting work summaries, etc., and adding some old poems, calligraphy, and paintings, which showed my feudal residual thinking. In the second half of last year, I also planned to restore the "China Forum" during the War of Resistance Against Japan as a comprehensive publication, launching free debates on academic issues. I wanted to invite some famous writers, scientists, and historians to organize an editorial committee, using this to "meet friends through literature and talk about learning and politics." Although this matter has not been realized until now, it shows that my attempts and activities always want to play a role in the cultural, educational, and scientific and technological circles. These ideas and practices are obviously in line with my political methods.

I have always been accustomed to the patriarchal leadership style in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. For example, the supplementary election of Huang Qixiang as vice chairman at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in March this year was produced in an undemocratic manner, which aroused dissatisfaction among party members. This shows that I regarded the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party as my private world, forgetting that it is a component of the people's democratic united front. Therefore, I often do not respect the leadership of the Communist Party, and it has become an organization that endangers the leading Party. My mistake is serious. In the future, I must completely change direction, return the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to all its members, sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and guide the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to become a political organization for socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Judging from the above-mentioned various erroneous facts, in the past year or so, my political thought has degenerated to such a shameful, hateful, and terrible point. I was elated and blinded by personal gain, and my personal political ambitions grew day by day. I attempted to use my set of reactionary political propositions, using my work position, through various means, such as formal meetings, forums, and private talks, and the organizational relations of the two democratic parties and the propaganda mechanism of Guangming Daily, to gradually expand influence and spread poison in order to achieve them. All these erroneous words and actions show that I stand on the reactionary position of the bourgeois right wing to negate the most basic system of our country, negate the dictatorship of the proletariat, negate democratic centralism, and negate the leadership of the Party. They are completely anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. I cannot escape responsibility for this major crime. I am willing to plead guilty to the people of the whole country, and plead guilty to the Party and the government.

It is only natural that the people of the whole country demand that this right-wing element be given a just punishment, and I am willing to accept it. I hate my own ugliness and want to completely defeat the old reactionary me, not let him be resurrected. I want to join the people of the whole country to participate in the serious struggle against right-wing elements, including the struggle against myself. The great Chinese Communist Party saved me in the past, and today the Party saves me once again. I hope that under the leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, I will gain a new life, so that I can return to the position of loving the Party, loving the country, and loving socialism, thoroughly correct my mistakes, and serve socialism wholeheartedly.

Representatives, this review is only a review of bowing my head and admitting guilt, not comprehensive enough and not profound enough. All the issues that must be confessed will continue to be thoroughly confessed to the relevant units. Finally, I hope that all representatives will continue to give serious exposure and criticism of my erroneous words and actions.

    向人民低头认罪
    章伯钧的发言
    我今天是一个在政治上犯有严重错误的罪人，能够获得全体代表们的宽大，站在你们面前，允许利用几分钟的时间，来表示我承认错误，低头认罪，下最大的决心努力改造自己的态度。周总理在政府工作报告中曾指示过：只要“经过外力的推动，生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够幡然悔悟，接受改造，社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的。”在这次连日大会上和各个小组会议上，特别是安徽代表小组会议上各位代表对我所进行的谴责和揭发，将我的丑恶的荒谬的言行纷纷暴露出来，我表示衷心的接受和感谢。自从全国人民把我严重的错误言行提出以后，我们国家的敌人如帝国主义者，台湾蒋帮分子和潜藏在国内的少数反革命分子都在兴高彩烈地利用我们这般右派分子的反动言行当作宣传工具，企图破坏我们伟大祖国的威信，这使我感到万分的悲痛，觉得自己的罪行更加严重起来。“亲者痛心，仇者称快”，因此我深深地感到全国人民和全体代表对于我的责备和揭发，正是对我进行抢救工作，不让我完全沉沦下去，而是给我有再生的机会，我在此要再一次向全国人民和各位代表表示衷心的感谢！
    我的错误思想和罪行是有历史的根源，反动的阶级本质和一贯性的。我是地主阶级出身，长期受着封建思想（桐城派）和资产阶级教育的人。一九二七年我背叛了光荣的中国共产党以后，堕落成“三分反共，七分反蒋”的中间路线的首要分子，组成了所谓第三党——中国农工民主党的前身。专作政治军事投机活动，一遇到机会就行动起来，没有了机会，就停止下来。这样的右倾机会主义的投机思想，一直保留到中国人民伟大的革命胜利以后。在一九五一年七月一日正逢着光荣的伟大的正确的中国共产党三十周年诞辰之日，我虽然发表了“共产党救了我的自我批判”一文，表示了悔悟之意，但仍然没有完全挖出坏思想的根源，因此我的立场站得不稳，忽“左”忽右，忽冷忽热，往往表现两面派的作风，对旧事物很留恋，对新事物只是表面接受，而实际有距离。这个潜伏下来的坏思想在一九五六年苏共二十次代表大会对斯大林的个人崇拜进行批判以后，又重新冒出头来了。我对斯大林有着过分的恶毒的批评，对苏联的伟大的社会主义建设的成绩有时给以过低评价，有时强调了它的缺点。又因为反教条主义的影响，就连对马克思列宁主义的基本原理也加以轻视，从未认真学习，这就形成了反马列主义的所谓修正主义思想。这个新的坏思想正与我过去的右倾机会主义思想是一脉相承的。它的危险性是服务于资产阶级的危险性，正如毛主席所指出的，它是：“反对或者企图削弱人民民主专政和共产党的领导，反对或者企图削弱社会主义改造和社会主义建设”的。不止于此，我的坏思想又窃取了联共第十九次党代表大会马林科夫报告中的一句话大意是“民主自由的旗帜资产阶级已经不能掌握了，要由工人阶级来掌握”。所以我在今年政协全体会议上的发言中就有了这样两句话：“我爱社会主义，我也爱民主”。这显然我错误地认为社会主义与民主是对立的东西，这一个重大的错误思想正是“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”文中所痛加驳斥的一点。此外，我又荒谬地把资本主义国家的科学技术和“民主生活方式”看作有它们的生命力。错误地以为只要我们有了社会主义再加上科学技术和“民主”，我们国家的生活就更加完满。从去年以来我往往在许多私人谈话和大小会议上，把这一套挂着修正主义招牌而实际是资产阶级右派思想的谰调向人们鼓吹。这一毒素害人不浅，民盟和农工民主党中右派分子固然投其所好，有的进步分子也在不知不觉中受了毒害，这是我的罪过。
    在这样恶毒的反社会主义反人民的资产阶级右派思想主导之下，我最近一年多以来，特别在帮助党整风运动期间所犯的严重错误的言行，是难以饶恕的。
    一九五六年我提出把政协作为“参议院”看待，这就是改头换面的资产阶级民主议会形式。其目的在于扩大我的所谓“民主”，以便自己在此情况下有所作为，使非党民主人士也有所作为。在今年中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上，我又错误的提出“政治设计院”，主张多研究些国家的政策方针，加强民主党派的权利。我把政协、民主党派和人民团体，放在和人大一样的地位看待，这是不折不扣的想用资产阶级的民主，来代替无产阶级专政，来代替人民代表大会制度，这是违犯宪法的主张，必然走向反党反人民的资本主义复辟的道路上去。
    不仅如此，自从党中央提出“长期共存，互相监督”，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”和毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾问题后，我就根据我的主观愿望，加以曲解，特别强调民主党派的监督作用，并且错误地认为社会主义革命基本完成，阶级斗争基本结束。各阶层特别是中上层知识分子有所进步，可以放心发展。直到最近中共提出整风，要民主党派帮助整风，我对于发展组织更加强调起来，我认为每个民主党派可以发展几十万人，几个民主党派合起来可以发展一二百万人。我还主张民主党派可以发展组织到县一级，各民主党派协议分县发展。我又曾说，社会主义革命基本完成后，民主党派的性质与任务应重新估价，应该把民主党派的性质与任务提高一步。这种荒谬的主张是企图扩大民主党派的政治势力，增加政治资本以满足个人的政治欲望，实际上是削弱党的领导，形成和党“分庭抗礼”的形势，对于党是最危害的。
    关于章、罗联盟的问题，在一九五六年以前，我和罗隆基有过私人权利的斗争。自五六年后，由于思想认识的一致，走上了今天章罗联盟的险途，我们联盟的结合，最基本的因素是由于彼此都是站在资产阶级的立场，我的政治主张，符合他的要求，因而一些过去和他接近而反对我的高级知识分子，也一变过去反对我的态度而同意了我。罗隆基曾不断地向我表示：“你走到那里，我跟到那里！”并提出民盟沈老做名誉主席，我可做主席，他就可以做第一副主席，我没有同意。自去年以来在民盟工作上，他支持我的意见，在民盟中央人事安排上，如费孝通、范朴斋、潘光旦、曾昭抡、吴景超等的工作岗位，我都满足了罗的愿望。民盟分工他管宣传，我管文教。“争鸣”月刊，同意由他领导，我亦不加以过问。特别是他在民盟和政协方面极力强调知识分子问题，我都予以支持，即在他硬要掌管文化俱乐部问题上，我也支持了他。
    为什么我要和罗隆基妥协呢？我想在民盟内大知识分子中间取得一定的政治影响，所以我想通过罗的关系，使我在知识分子中间好做工作。盟内大知识分子如费孝通、潘大逵、曾昭抡、吴景超、潘光旦、华罗庚、钱端升、马哲民等都和罗有私交，在此我需要得到罗的支持，才能达到影响大知识分子的目的。这里，就可以说，由思想上的共鸣，进到政治上的联盟。彼此互为利用，相得益彰。
    今年五月初，在中共整风开始时，由我专断地约罗共同召集有关宣传、文教、组织部分负责同志讨论设立四个小组座谈会的问题，此事事先并未和史、高二位副主席商量。
    四个小组为：
    （一）“长期共存，互相监督”与“百花齐放，百家争鸣”组。
    （二）科学规划组。
    （三）有职无权组。
    （四）高等学校党委制组。
    组织这四个小组的目的是想通过大知识分子一套资产阶级的看法，宣扬资产阶级的民主和科学，混淆人民对于社会主义优越性和党的领导不可动摇性的认识。其后果造成思想混乱，使少数右派高级知识分子的阴谋活动更为猖狂起来向党进攻。如科学规划小组所提出的对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见其危害于党的领导科学工作和破坏科学研究工作的计划性和统一性，正如郭沫若副委员长和潘梓年代表所指责的那样严重。其他三个小组，虽未召开会议进行工作，但在政治上所造成的影响，同样严重和恶劣。
    六月五日下午有三位教授，即曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通和民盟秘书长胡愈之来找我，谈到高等学校内整风运动的情况时，三位教授一致认为局面严重，随时可以发生大游行，假使处理不妥当，学生若是和市民联合起来，也有可能发生类似匈牙利的事件。他们还说，情况虽然严重，但他们有办法解决，“可放可收”，党委是无办法的。我同意他们的这个看法，并决定第二天召开会议，加约了黄药眠、陶大镛、吴景超三教授并邀请史副主席、闵刚侯常务委员和叶笃义主任，在一起谈了一次，谈话内容大致和头天所谈情况相同。我当时也同意他们的意见。这就说明我站在资产阶级右派的立场上，支持一个狂妄的反党的阴谋，企图由民盟代替党在高等学校的领导地位。
    本年四月一日储安平到光明日报任总编辑后，我很赏识他，觉得他有一定的工作能力，而他的新闻观点和思想认识，有和我相符之处，这种不谋而合的看法表现在光明日报在此期间的编辑方针是：
    （一）多报道一些民主党派的活动和民主党派个人的活动。
    （二）多报道一些资本主义国家的科学技术发明。
    （三）多报道一些民族主义国家社会党的活动。
    这样的方针是和我资产阶级的一套想法相吻合，从而篡改了光明日报的编辑方针，作为宣传资产阶级民主的喉舌，尤其可恨的是我同意了储安平派记者到九大城市组织座谈会，发生到处点火的作用，破坏党的整风运动。同时储与罗的私人关系较多，对于储主持光明日报的方针罗亦有所指示，因而章罗储的右派思想在光明日报就起着共同的作用。
    今年上半年，我在农工民主党鼓励李伯球在北京搞大发展，整风运动开始后，我也告诉他组织座谈会，农工北京市委会在五月一个多月中，在医药、卫生、工程技术、农业、教育、文艺、京剧六界共组织了二十一个座谈会，参加的成员和群众共有五百多人。不仅如此，在这期间，我又派王一帆到东北，杨逸棠到山东，张云川到河南等地发展组织。我这样的大发展计划，是想通过农工民主党影响科技医卫人员，正如通过民盟影响大学教授一样，其目的都是企图取得政治资本，扩大我的政治影响。
    此外为了扩大我在农工民主党内外的政治影响，从去年以来将“学习通讯”改组为前进报，改变过去着重于报道党务报告工作总结等，加进了一些旧的诗词书画，这表现了我的封建残余思想。我在去年下半年，还打算恢复以前抗战期间的“中华论坛”作为一个综合性的刊物，在学术上展开自由争论。我想邀请一些有名望的文学家、科学家、历史学家，组织一个编辑委员会，借此“以文会友，谈学谈政”。这件事直到现在虽未实现，但说明我的企图和活动，总想在文教界和科技界起点作用。这些想法和做法，显然是跟我政治上搞一套的办法是相适应的。
    我在农工民主党向来习惯于家长制的领导作风，如今年三月农工民主党三中全会补选黄琪翔为副主席的事，就是用不民主的方式产生的，引起党内同志们的不满。这就说明我把农工党当做私有天下，忘记它是人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分，所以往往不尊重共产党的领导，变成了危害领导党的组织，我的错误是严重的。今后必须彻底改变方向，把农工民主党归还于全体成员，真诚接受共产党的领导，把农工民主党引向为社会主义建设和社会主义改造的政治组织。
    从上述各种错误的事实看来，在这一年多来，我的政治思想蜕化到了这样可耻可恶而又这样可怕的地步，我得意忘形，利令智昏，个人政治野心与日俱增起来。我企图把自己一套的反动的政治主张，利用我的工作的地位，通过种种方式，如正式会议、座谈会和私人会谈等和两个民主党派组织关系与一个光明日报的宣传机构，去逐步扩大影响，散布毒素，以求其实现。而这一切错误的言论和行动，就是说明我站在资产阶级右派的反动立场，来否定我们国家最基本的制度，否定无产阶级专政，否定民主集中制，否定党的领导，是完全反党反人民反社会主义的。这一个重大的罪行的责任，我是不能逃避的。我愿向全国人民请罪，向党和政府请罪。
    当前全国人民要求给我这个右派分子以严正的处分，这是理所当然的，我愿意接受。我恨自己的丑恶，要把旧的反动的我彻底打垮，不再让他还魂，我要同全国人民一道来参加反右派分子的严肃斗争，包括对我自己的斗争在内。伟大的中国共产党过去救了我，今天党又重新救我一次，我希望在党和毛主席的领导和教育下，获得新的生命，使我重新回到爱党爱国爱社会主义的立场，痛改前非，全心全意为社会主义服务。
    各位代表，我这个检讨只是一个低头认罪的检讨，不够全面也不够深刻。关于一切必须交代的问题将继续向有关单位进行彻底交代。最后希望各位代表对我的错误言行，继续给予严正的揭发和批判。
