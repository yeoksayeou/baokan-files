    Ancient Scenery of the Qin Canal
    The Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Wu Zhong has a history of Yellow River irrigation for more than 2,000 years. The "Qin Canal" was built in the Qin Dynasty and irrigates hundreds of thousands of mu of fertile land in the plains of the entire prefecture. Now, a tall drilling rig has been erected at the intake of the Qin Canal, marking the start of the technical design stage for the Qingtongxia Water Control Project.
