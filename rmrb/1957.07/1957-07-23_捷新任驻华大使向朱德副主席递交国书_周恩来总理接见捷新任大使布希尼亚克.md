During the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Jan Bušniak delivered a speech of praise, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.

In his speech of praise, Ambassador Jan Bušniak said that the relations between our two countries have been friendly and close since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and are growing stronger day by day. This is because our two countries share the common goal of building a socialist society. The recent visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to the People's Republic of China and the signing of many documents are clear evidence of this fraternal relationship. Our people know that this sincere friendship and selfless cooperation contribute to the unity of the entire socialist camp, help to smash the imperialists' attempts to weaken this camp, and also make outstanding contributions to the consolidation of world peace.

In his reply, Vice Chairman Zhu De said that Czechoslovakia is a strong member of the socialist family, and it has always been faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and has made brilliant contributions to continuously consolidating the close unity and friendly cooperation of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia has established extensive economic and cultural ties with countries around the world, and it is waging an unyielding struggle for the establishment of a European collective security system and against the resurgence of West German militarism. All this has played a significant role in easing the international situation and promoting friendly cooperation among peoples of all countries. The Chinese people admire and fully support Czechoslovakia's efforts to strengthen the solidarity of socialist countries and safeguard world peace.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that in recent years, the fraternal friendly cooperative relationship between China and Czechoslovakia has achieved great development. The Chinese people cherish this friendship very much and express their heartfelt gratitude to the Czechoslovak people for the sincere assistance they have given to our country's socialist construction. The Chinese people will continue to do everything possible to strengthen the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between our two countries.
