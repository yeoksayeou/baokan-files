    We fully agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    We are medical workers, and in the spirit of the central government's call for increased production and conservation, we would like to offer our opinions on some problems that exist in the implementation of the publicly funded healthcare system. We ask all representatives to offer their criticism.

    Since the State Council issued the "Implementation Measures for Publicly Funded Healthcare" in 1952, the health of state workers has been guaranteed. They no longer need to worry about personal financial burdens when they are sick, or worry about not being able to afford treatment. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of workers for building socialism and has played a positive role in completing various work tasks. This fully demonstrates the care of the Party and the government for state workers and the superiority of our system. However, there are still some wasteful phenomena in the implementation of publicly funded healthcare, which are not in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. According to reports, various regions raised different opinions on publicly funded healthcare at the National Conference of Health Department Directors, which fully shows that there are problems in the current publicly funded healthcare methods and should be improved.

    I. Main Problems Existing in the Current Publicly Funded Healthcare System

    The problems existing in the publicly funded healthcare system mainly have two aspects: First, the implementation method adopts a method in which all expenses are covered by the state. Second, ideologically, it is manifested in all the wrong ideas of medical personnel and those who enjoy publicly funded healthcare, and a lack of correct understanding of the great significance of publicly funded healthcare, thus causing huge expenditures and serious waste of publicly funded healthcare funds.

    After the implementation of publicly funded healthcare methods, the scope of diseases reimbursed by public funds has gradually expanded in various provinces and cities across the country. Judging from the current situation of publicly funded healthcare, it is already approaching an unlimited state. Some diseases that may or may not need to be treated are being treated, and even some that are not diseases at all, such as bad moods, mosquito bites, fly stings, summer heat rash, and winter dry skin, are also being treated everywhere. There are also those who want cosmetic surgery, or to get rid of bad body odor, and request to have single eyelids turned into double eyelids, or to have body odor cured. There are also those who apply to the former Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital for physiological defects that are not diseases at all. Even if medical technology can indeed cure certain physiological defects, it is not reasonable to include the cost of treating and correcting these defects in public fund reimbursement.

    In terms of physical examinations, if the public healthcare management department organizes regular and planned examinations for state workers to carry out preventive healthcare work, of course, it should be paid for by public funds. However, some personal matters, such as pre-marital examinations and summer swimming examinations, are also reimbursed by public funds, which is also unreasonable.

    In terms of contraception, especially since the promotion of family planning, many people have proposed tubal ligation, vasectomy, and induced abortion. Some regions also reimburse these sterilization surgeries through public funds, which are not diseases at all, and it is unreasonable to pay for them with public funds.

    Due to the unclear scope of use of public healthcare funds, a phenomenon of everything being covered by the state has formed. Those who enjoy publicly funded healthcare have a simple reliance mentality, and regardless of whether it is a major illness, a minor illness, or not a disease at all, they want it to be borne by public funds. This makes the expenditure of public healthcare funds a bottomless pit.

    The lack of correct understanding of publicly funded healthcare by medical personnel and those who enjoy publicly funded healthcare is another important factor causing huge expenditures and waste. For example, some medical personnel are perfunctory in their diagnoses. Whenever a patient comes, regardless of whether they are sick or not, they prescribe medicine, lacking a spirit of seeking truth from facts. They are afraid of trouble, arbitrarily accommodate patients, and rarely pay attention to saving and cherishing national medicinal materials. They also casually use expensive drugs, such as antibiotics, vitamins, sulfonamides, and expensive imported drugs with uncertain effects. Individual traditional Chinese medicine doctors use large amounts of ginseng, deer antler, and other precious tonic drugs.

    Individual people who enjoy publicly funded healthcare see a doctor casually, take medicine but do not eat it, or insist on taking that expensive medicine or getting that expensive injection. Those who do not need to be hospitalized want to be hospitalized, and those who should be discharged from the hospital refuse to be discharged, treating the hospital as their home. This phenomenon is especially common among chronic disease patients in sanatoriums, causing a large amount of overspending and waste of medical funds, increasing the number of patients and busyness of medical institutions, reducing the turnover rate of beds, relaxing labor discipline in administrative units, and increasing absenteeism, which directly or indirectly affects the completion of administrative tasks.

    II. Ways to Improve Publicly Funded Healthcare

    The current methods for improving publicly funded healthcare are mainly to overcome waste and strengthen management, to minimize unnecessary expenses for the country, so that public healthcare funds are used properly, while still guaranteeing the health of state workers. To this end:

    First, adopt a method that combines state burden and personal burden, and charge patients a portion of outpatient registration fees and hospitalization fees.

    Public healthcare funds should be clearly used for medical care, including medicines, surgery, physiotherapy, laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, etc. The registration fees currently charged by general public medical institutions include the handling fees and paper fees for medical institutions to diagnose illnesses. According to the actual situation, the registration fees charged are far from enough to cover various expenses, and the vast majority still relies on state subsidies. Since the state bears most of the expenses, and only charges patients some registration fees, its purpose is not to contribute to the revenue, but to reduce the patient's mentality of completely relying on the public.

    Compared with outpatient registration fees, hospitalization costs are higher than outpatient costs, so a portion can be charged proportionally. General treatment hospitals can charge relatively more for hospitalization fees, while sanatoriums can charge relatively less because the length of stay is longer, in order to take care of the individual's burden not being too heavy.

    Charging patients outpatient registration fees and part of the hospitalization fees, although it will increase the personal burden, the cost is not large, and most state workers can afford it. More importantly, this measure is appropriate and reasonable. If someone really cannot solve the cost problem, they can also ask the administration or the labor union for help.

    Second, change the method of financial management. Outpatient fees should be managed by administrative units, and hospitalization fees should still be managed by health institutions.

    At the National Conference of Health Department Directors, someone proposed the method of handing over public healthcare funds to various administrative units for management, which is good. In the past, there was a lack of connection between health and administrative departments in public healthcare work. Most administrative departments did not care about it, and all medical problems of staff were pushed away, without communication or cooperation, resulting in great drawbacks. Administrative units should play a positive role in this work. However, administrative units vary in size and number of people. If all the funds are allocated to each unit for management, some small units will inevitably find it difficult to allocate funds due to the small amount of funds they control. If there are one or two hospitalized patients in this unit, all the unit's funds will be spent. Therefore, it is recommended that only outpatient expenses be managed by each administrative unit, and hospitalization expenses should still be managed uniformly by health institutions. According to the situation of public healthcare work in the country in recent years, the incidence of outpatient patients is generally relatively balanced—that is, large units have more patients, and small units have fewer patients. In addition, if the method of charging outpatient registration fees is adopted, it can reduce the number of people seeing a doctor and reduce expenses, which will not cause difficulties for administrative units.

    As for the division of outpatient and hospitalization expenses, according to incomplete statistics from various places, outpatient accounts for about 60% and hospitalization accounts for 40%. After the public healthcare management method is changed and the method of combining state burden and personal burden is adopted, outpatient expenses will inevitably be reduced. The standard of public healthcare funds per person per month can be divided equally, and 50% can be used as outpatient expenses and allocated to each unit for use.

    Third, strengthen ideological education for medical personnel and state workers.

    The occurrence of waste in publicly funded healthcare is closely related to the ideological understanding of medical personnel in medical institutions. Because some medical personnel cannot grasp the principles of treatment, and arbitrarily accommodate patients, they are likely to prompt individual patients to make excessive and unreasonable demands. In addition, individual medical personnel do not diagnose carefully, do not cherish national resources, and abuse valuable drugs and tonics, resulting in overspending of funds and waste of medicinal materials. Therefore, strengthening the education of medical personnel and rectifying the medical style are major keys to overcoming the overspending of funds and waste in publicly funded healthcare.

    Secondly, the state workers who enjoy publicly funded healthcare should be strengthened in their ideological education, so that they can establish the communist moral character of cherishing state property, cultivate the virtue of thrift, and correct erroneous behaviors such as disobeying the medical system, wasting medicines, and the supply system mentality. We should also actively carry out health and health care work in organs, implement the policy of prevention first, so as to reduce the incidence of disease and absenteeism. Only in this way can we reduce or even avoid the overspending and waste of public healthcare funds.

    Please correct us if the above opinions are not correct.

    关于改进公费医疗制度的意见
    徐佐夏、柯麟、黄家驷、章央芬的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎承检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。
    我们是医务工作者，本着中央提出的增产节约的精神，就公费医疗实施中存在的一些问题，提出我们的意见来，请各位代表指正。
    从一九五二年政务院颁发了公费医疗实施办法以后，国家工作人员的身体健康有了保障，患病后不需要顾虑个人的经济负担，为治不起病而担忧，大大的鼓舞了工作人员对建设社会主义的热情，对完成各项工作任务起了积极的作用，这充分说明了党和政府对于国家工作人员的关怀和我国制度的优越性。但在公费医疗实施中，还存在着一些浪费现象，不合于增产节约的精神。据报载全国卫生厅局长会议上各个地区都对于公费医疗提出了不同的意见，这就充分说明在现行公费医疗办法中，存在着问题，应当改进。
    一、现行公费医疗中存在的主要问题
    在公费医疗中存在的问题主要有两方面：一是在实施办法上，采取了一切费用由国家包下来的办法。二是思想上表现在医务人员和享受公费医疗人员的一切错误思想，和对公费医疗的重大意义缺乏正确认识，因而使公费医疗经费造成浩大的支出和严重的浪费。
    公费医疗办法实施以后，全国各省市关于公费报销的疾病范围逐步扩大，就目前公费医疗情况来看，已经近似无限制的状态。一些可看可不看的疾病也在看，甚至一些根本就不是病的，因情绪不好，蚊子咬，苍蝇叮，夏天生痱子，冬天皮肤干燥等，也到处看。又有因要美容，因不使身上发生不好的味道，而要求将单眼皮做成双眼皮，要求将狐臭给以根治等。还有因为是生理上的缺陷，并不是病，而申请到前北京苏联红十字医院去看。纵然在医学技术上对某些生理缺陷确能治得好，但如果将治疗和纠正这些缺陷的经费，也列入公费报销，就不够合理了。
    在体格检查方面，如果系公费医疗管理部门为展开预防保健工作而组织国家工作人员定期有计划的检查，当然应由公费开支。但某些个人的事情，如婚前检查，夏季游泳检查等，也都由公费报销，这也不够合理。
    在避孕问题方面，特别从提倡节育以来，提出结扎输卵管、输精管及人工流产的人很多，这些绝育手术，有的地区也由公费报销，这根本就不是病，由公费开支也是不合理的。
    由于公费医疗经费的使用范围不明确，形成了一切由国家包下来的现象，而享受公费医疗的人员，存有单纯依赖思想，不论大病小病或根本不是什么病，都要公费担负，这样就使公费医疗经费的支出，形成无底洞。
    医务人员和享受公费医疗人员，对公费医疗缺乏正确认识，也是造成开支浩大和浪费的另一重要因素。例如有的医务人员在诊断时草率从事，凡病人来到，不管有病无病一概处方发药，缺乏实事求是的精神，怕找麻烦，任意迁就，很少注意到节约和爱护国家药材。又如随便使用价昂的药品，如抗生素、维生素、磺胺类药剂以及效果并不确实的昂贵舶来药品，有个别中医多量使用人参、鹿茸及其他贵重补养药品。
    个别享受公费医疗的人员，随便看病，拿药不吃，或硬要指定吃那种贵重药，打那种贵重针，不需要住院的要住院，住院到了应该出院时候而又不肯出院，以医院为家。这种现象，尤以疗养院的慢性病病人为多，使医疗经费造成大量超支和浪费，使医疗机构病人增加和忙乱，使病床的周转率降低，使行政单位劳动纪律松懈，缺勤率增高，也直接或多或少地影响到行政任务的完成。
    二、改进公费医疗的办法
    目前改进公费医疗的办法，主要是克服浪费、加强管理，为国家尽量减少不必要的开支，使公费医疗经费使用得当，而又能保障国家工作人员的身体健康。为此：
    第一，采用国家负担与个人负担相结合的办法，向病人收取门诊挂号费和住院费的一部分。
    公费医疗经费应该明确使用于医疗方面，其中包括药品、手术、理疗、化验、X光检查等。目前一般公立医疗机构所收的挂号费，包括医疗机构诊病的手续费和纸张费。按实际情况来看，所取挂号费用，是远远的不够各项开支的，绝大部分还要依靠国家补给，国家既然负担了大部分费用，而只向病人收取一些挂号费，其目的不在于挹注，而在于减少病人完全依赖公家的思想。
    住院费与门诊挂号费相比较，住院的花费较门诊为大，故可按比例收取一部分。一般治疗医院住院费可收的比较多些，疗养院因住院期较长，为照顾到个人负担不要过重，可收的比较少一些。
    向病人收取门诊挂号费和部分住院费，虽能加重了个人负担，但费用数字不大，一般国家工作人员，都可能负担得起。更重要的是，这一措施是应该的，是合理的。如有人确实不能解决费用问题，还可请求行政或工会给以帮助。
    第二，改变经费管理方法，门诊费交行政单位掌握，住院费仍由卫生机构掌握。
    全国卫生厅局长会议上，有人提出将公费医疗经费交由各行政单位掌握的办法，是好的。过去在公费医疗工作中缺乏卫生与行政部门的联系，多数行政部门不加过问，凡工作人员的医疗问题，一推了事，互不通气，互不协作，产生了很大的弊病。行政单位应发挥这一工作的积极作用。但行政单位大小不同，人数多少不一，如果把全部经费拨交各单位掌握，势必一些小的单位由于掌握经费少，不易调度，如果这单位中有一两个住院病人，就会将全单位的经费花光。因此，建议只将门诊费用交由各行政单位自行掌握，住院费用仍统一由卫生机构掌握。根据全国几年来公费医疗工作情况来看，一般门诊病人发病率比较平衡，——也就是大单位发病人数多，小单位发病人数少。加之如采用收取门诊挂号费的办法，既可减少看病人数，又可减少经费支出，对行政单位不会产生困难。
    至于门诊和住院费用的划分问题，据各地不完全的统计，大约是门诊占百分之六十，住院占百分之四十。公费医疗管理方法改变，和采取国家负担与个人负担相结合的办法以后，门诊费用势必减少。可将每人每月公费医疗经费标准平分，按百分之五十作为门诊费用，拨交各单位使用。
    第三，加强对医务人员和国家工作人员的思想教育。
    公费医疗中浪费现象的产生，与医疗机构的医务人员思想认识有很大关系。由于部分医务人员不能掌握治疗原则，任意迁就病人，也就容易促使个别病人提出过高和无理的要求，加以个别医务人员不悉心诊断，不珍惜国家资财，滥用贵重药品，滥用补养药品，造成经费超支与药材浪费。所以加强医务人员的教育，端正医疗作风，是克服公费医疗经费超支与浪费现象的重大关键。
    其次，对享受公费医疗的国家工作人员，应当加强其思想教育，要他们树立珍惜国家财产的共产主义道德品质，养成节约的美德，纠正不服从医疗制度，浪费药品和供给制思想等错误行为。并在机关中积极开展卫生保健工作，贯彻预防为主方针，以减低发病率和缺勤率，只有这样，才能减少以至避免公费医疗经费的超支和浪费。
    以上意见，是否正确，请指正。
