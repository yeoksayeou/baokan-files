Chen Renbing Admits to Being the Leading Figure of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Shanghai

Shanghai, July 12 (Report from our newspaper) - Chen Renbing, a key member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Shanghai, has recently made a preliminary confession of some of his activities against the Party leadership and against socialism.

Chen Renbing admitted that he was the leading figure of the Luo Longji anti-Party group in Shanghai. He said that he had been close to this group since 1947 and fully joined it in 1948-1949. In 1949, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Luo Longji nominated him as a member of the Central Committee. At that meeting, Luo Longji attacked Shi Liang and other progressive figures within the League, and Chen Renbing acted as Luo Longji's "hatchet man." At that time, Luo Longji often invited him, Pan Dakui, Zhang Dongsun, Fei Xiaotong, Zeng Zhaolun, and others to meet at Fan Puzhai's house to discuss strategies. At the China Democratic League Central Organization and Propaganda Work Conference in 1951, Chen Renbing and other members of the Luo Longji clique fiercely opposed the class alliance nature of the China Democratic League, fearing the participation of non-bourgeois elements. Luo Longji also discussed Pan Dakui's work issues with Chen Renbing and Pan Dakui. Initially, they believed that Pan Dakui's relationship with Chu Tunan in Sichuan was not good, and his work was not going smoothly, so they planned to transfer him to Beijing to work for the Propaganda Department of the China Democratic League Central Committee. However, they then realized that Zeng Zhaolun was already in the Central Propaganda Department, and Sichuan was very important. Luo Longji believed that Pan Dakui was better off in Sichuan than not, and it was good to seize a deputy chairman first. After that, Luo Longji and Pu Xixiu came to Shanghai and had close contact with Chen Renbing. Chen Renbing also said that his position in Luo Longji's mind gradually increased because he was more "hardworking" than Peng Wenyin. Luo Longji originally wanted to get Peng Wenyin a position as deputy mayor of Shanghai, but later changed his mind to replace Peng Wenyin with Chen Renbing.

Chen Renbing said that, according to his analysis, the group's program was: (1) To unite some people who put their own and the clique's interests above the interests of the people, engage in grabbing positions and leadership within the League, to confront progressive comrades close to the Party, and to confront the Party's leadership. (2) To openly or covertly oppose the Soviet Union, oppose teaching reforms, and various progressive measures. (3) To only verbally support socialism, but actually stand on the position of the exploiting class, and adopt a revisionist attitude towards new things, new systems, and socialist transformation.

Chen Renbing added: "The members of this anti-Party group in Shanghai, besides himself, include Peng Wenyin, Zhao Wenbi, Sun Dayu, Sun Siming, Han Ming, and nearly twenty others. Their activity strategy is to especially target the three types of dissatisfaction among intellectuals towards the Party, namely, having a position without power, amateurs leading professionals, and unemployment issues, instigating everywhere, and setting fires everywhere.

Chen Renbing himself confessed that he had set fires in film, Peking opera, local opera, literature, publishing, and reading, etc. He used Yan Huizhu's opinions on work arrangements and her husband's unemployment issue to incite the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. In literary circles, he specially invited writers such as Wang Xiyan to have dinner and talk at the cultural club, and later used the conversation materials, exaggerating them and spreading them everywhere. In the music circle, when an orchestra wanted to buy a set of twelve symphonic records, the leadership approved the purchase of four, Chen Renbing used this to publicize everywhere that "amateurs cannot lead professionals." In the education circle, at a forum of the China Democratic League, he advocated that primary and secondary school teachers should speak out freely without fear, and said that a school-wide staff meeting does not count as major democracy. In the realm of traditional Chinese painting, after the sandalwood fan issue had been reasonably resolved by the government, he still discussed with the rightist Xia Gaoyang, wanting to once again incite artists' dissatisfaction with the government. Within the China Democratic League organization, Chen Renbing specifically developed some people who were dissatisfied with the Party to join the League as political capital. He also wanted to reorganize the League's municipal committee organization department, reducing its powers and making the various specialized work committees independent, so that he could directly control them. Chen Renbing said: "My activities were all for the purpose of expanding the influence of this group within the League, seizing more leadership, and gathering more backward elements dissatisfied with the Party's leadership in the literary and cultural circles, as a foundation for resisting the Party's leadership."

The above are Chen Renbing's confessions to the rectification group at Fudan University, but his confession is extremely incomplete, and he still avoids talking about many major issues. The China Democratic League rectification group at Fudan University ordered Chen Renbing to continue his confession.

    陈仁炳承认是章罗联盟在上海的首要分子
    本报上海12日电　章罗联盟在上海的骨干分子陈仁炳，最近初步交代了他反对党的领导反社会主义的一些活动。
    陈仁炳承认他是罗隆基反党集团在上海的首要分子。他说，他从1947年起就靠拢了这一集团，1948—1949年起完全参加了这个集团。1949年民盟召开中央四中全会，罗隆基提名他当选了中央委员。在那次会上，罗隆基打击史良等盟内的进步人物，陈仁炳为罗隆基作“打手”。那时，罗隆基经常邀集他和潘大逵、张东荪、费孝通、曾昭抡等在范朴斋家里开会研究策略。在1951年的民盟中央组织宣传工作会议上，陈仁炳和罗隆基小集团的其他成员激烈反对民盟的阶级联盟性质，怕有非资产阶级分子参加进来。罗隆基还和陈仁炳、潘大逵一起研究过潘大逵的工作问题。最初他们认为潘大逵在四川同楚图南关系搞得不好，工作不顺利，准备把他调到北京搞民盟中央宣传部，继而一想中央宣传部已有曾昭抡，同时四川非常重要，罗隆基认为潘大逵在四川总比不在好，先抓一个副主委也好。此后，罗隆基、浦熙修到上海来，和陈仁炳都有密切来往。陈仁炳还说，他在罗隆基心目中的地位逐渐增高，因为他比彭文应更加“埋头苦干”。罗隆基原来想把彭文应搞上一个上海副市长的职位，后来又改变想以陈仁炳代彭文应。
    陈仁炳说，照他分析，这个集团的纲领是：（一）结合一些将自己和小集团利益放在人民利益之上的人，在盟内进行抓地位抓领导权的勾当，以与进步的靠拢党的同志对抗，与党的领导对抗。（二）公开的或隐蔽的反对苏联，反对教学改革和各方面的进步措施。（三）仅仅在口头上拥护社会主义，而实际上站在剥削阶级立场，对新事物、新制度，对社会主义改造，采取修正主义的态度。
    陈仁炳又说：“这个反党集团在上海的成员除他以外，还有彭文应、赵文璧、孙大雨、孙斯鸣、韩鸣等近二十人。他们的活动策略，是特别针对知识分子对党不满的三种情况，即有职无权、外行领导内行和失业问题，到处挑拨，到处放火。
    陈仁炳自己供认，他在电影、京剧、地方剧、文学、出版、阅览等方面都放过火。他利用言慧珠对工作安排的意见和言的丈夫失业问题，煽动群众对党不满。在文学界，他曾特地请王西彦等作家在文化俱乐部吃饭谈话，后来就利用谈话材料，加以夸大，到处渲染。在音乐界，有一个乐团要买一套交响乐唱片共十二张，领导上批准买了四张，陈仁炳据此到处宣扬“外行不能领导内行”。在教育界，他在民盟一次座谈会上，主张中小学教师要大放大鸣，不要害怕，并说全校数职员大会，不算大民主。在国画界，当檀香扇问题已由政府合理解决后，他仍和右派分子夏高阳商量，想再度煽起艺人对政府的不满。在民盟机关内部，陈仁炳专门发展一些对党不满的人入盟，作为政治资本。他还想改组盟市委组织部，缩小其职权，把各专门工作委员会独立起来，以便他直接控制。陈仁炳说：“我的这些活动都是为了扩大这一集团在盟内的势力，夺取更多领导权，在文艺界、文化界结集更多落后的不满党的领导的分子，作为对抗党的领导的基础。”
    以上这些是陈仁炳在复旦大学整风小组上交代的，但他的交代极不彻底，对许多重大问题仍避而不谈。复旦大学民盟整风小组责令陈仁炳继续交代。
