Talking About "Difficulty in Sewing"

It has been more than a year since the cooperative transformation of handicrafts was realized. However, even now, some people still doubt or even deny the superiority of handicraft cooperation.

Most of those who doubt or deny the superiority of handicraft cooperation start with the sewing industry, which is most closely related to people's lives. They say: The cooperative was established in the spring, and it became troublesome to make clothes in the winter. It takes more than ten days or even a month to get a garment made to order. In the eyes of these people, it seems that "difficulty in sewing" is a disadvantage of cooperation.

Was the difficulty in sewing last winter caused by cooperation? Not only is it not, but on the contrary, without cooperation, it would have been many times more difficult to sew clothes last year. Take Shanghai as an example. Last year, the average salary of workers in the city increased by 8%, and it was concentrated in the supplementary payments after July and August; capitalists received 56.1 million yuan in dividends; market cloth coupons were relaxed, and cloth sales increased by 48%. Coupled with the publicity of beautifying life and advocating fashion, the situation of difficulty in sewing naturally formed. In this case, the superiority of cooperation was fully demonstrated. Just talking about fashion, Shanghai originally had only 190 seamstresses who could make fashionable clothes. Last year, during the most intense period, the handicraft cooperative made a surprise effort to train fashion workers, training more than 900 people in a few months. At the beginning, each person could only make one piece a day, but later they could make three pieces a day. The growth of technical strength and the improvement of productivity were unprecedented. In total, Shanghai produced more than 40% more clothes last year than the year before. The situation in other places is similar to that in Shanghai. For example, the sewing cooperative in Tianjin made 110,000 cotton-padded clothes in just October and November. Without cooperation, it would be unimaginable to achieve such great results.

Colleagues are no longer enemies

Individual handicraft workers competed and squeezed each other, and "colleagues are enemies." After cooperation, the relationship of competition and squeeze turned into a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. Members and members, cooperatives and cooperatives, exchanged experiences and studied technology together, thus creating and imitating many new products and improving the quality of original products. In 1956, Changsha City added 4,500 new designs and varieties; Tianjin City trial-produced more than 2,300 new products; and Shanghai City produced more than 3,000 new products. These include not only simple daily necessities, but also precision instruments and medical equipment.

Ancestral secrets revealed

"Passing on to daughters-in-law but not to daughters" is the old rule of handicraft workers with special skills. Under the conditions of individual operation, this is the only way to avoid the threat of competition. Many famous brands have been lost because of this. After cooperation, craftsmen are taken care of when they are old, and their descendants do not have to worry about not having food to eat. Many famous old artists no longer "teach one hand and keep one hand" as in the past. The five sisters of Chang Guilu, famous artists in Beijing who make glass grapes, did not marry in order to preserve their ancestral secrets. They never allowed people to watch when they were working, but now they have joined the cooperative and are also taking apprentices.

The off-season is no longer off

For some industries with seasonal production, when operating individually, due to the lack of funds, they cannot carry out reserve production in the off-season, and often experience the phenomenon of nothing to do in the off-season and being too busy in the peak season. After cooperation, the joint cooperative can adjust production and minimize the difference between busy and idle production in the off-season and peak season as much as possible. For example, in Shanghai's sewing industry, if the city joint cooperative had not appropriately controlled a part of the raw materials last winter, it would have been difficult to maintain production this spring. Many handicraft cooperatives in Beijing adopted the method of mutually adjusting the use of working capital in the first quarter of this year, which basically solved the problem of insufficient funds for production in the off-season. In this way, production is normal, and product prices will not rise and fall sharply due to seasonal ups and downs.

Liberating productive forces

After getting rid of the shackles of individual ownership, the production of handicrafts has been advancing at an alarming rate.

In the first year of cooperation – 1956 – the nation's handicraft workers created 11.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country, completing the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. This figure increased by 11.4% compared with the highest value of 1954 in history, and increased by 56.9% compared with the highest year before the war – 1936 (7.57 billion yuan in 1936). Compared with the year before cooperation (1955), the average annual output value of each handicraft cooperative member increased by 33.5%.

An indispensable force

Compared with large factories, small handicraft cooperatives seem insignificant. However, in the national economy, this is a significant and indispensable force.

In 1956, 16.6% of the total industrial output value was created by handicrafts. More than 104,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country paid more than 380 million yuan in taxes.

Handicraft cooperatives in various places vigorously produced various farm tools, and universally organized farm tool repair and assembly networks to support agricultural cooperatives. In this year, the farm tools produced by handicraft cooperatives averaged more than two pieces per farmer; and tens of millions of farm tools were repaired for farmers.

As an assistant to large industries, handicraft cooperative organizations produced a large number of various building materials to support industrial construction. The Xi'an Metal Manufacturing Cooperative manufactured more than 2,000 tons of metal building accessories for industrial departments in the past year; the Fuxian Ceramics Production Cooperative in Liaoning Province manufactured a total of more than 320 kilometers of ceramic pipes in one year, saving basic construction departments more than 1,400 tons of steel and more than 740 tons of cement.

In 1956, only ceramics and arts and crafts exported goods worth more than 73.47 million yuan, bringing in a lot of foreign exchange necessary for the country's construction.

Cooperation has improved production and also improved the lives of handicraft workers.

"In the past, three people shared a quilt, now one person has three quilts." Handicraft cooperative members in Shanghai use this sentence to describe the changes in their lives. Individual handicraft workers could not withstand wind and rain, had nothing to do in the off-season and had to go hungry, and a serious illness could make them poor. Now that they have joined the cooperative, their income is fixed, and their lives are getting better every day. In 1956 – the first year of cooperation – about 90% of the more than 4.7 million cooperative members across the country increased their income. According to typical surveys in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei and other provinces and cities, the average salary of cooperative members generally increased by about 15% compared with before joining the cooperative. The higher ones, such as the average salary of handicraft cooperative members in Tianjin, increased by 22.94%; and in Sichuan Province it increased by 20%.

In this year, the accumulation of cooperatives also increased greatly. Handicraft cooperatives in Jilin Province and Shanghai accumulated more than 10 million yuan in 1956. Many cooperatives have implemented public medical care and medical subsidy systems, and individual cooperative members with financial difficulties can also receive subsidies and relief from the cooperative.

Therefore, after hearing the reactionary remarks of right-wing elements, handicraft cooperative members in Beijing said very angrily: "Whoever says that the Communist Party's leadership is not good, let him come and see our cooperative!"

Shortcomings do exist

The transition of handicrafts from individual ownership to collective ownership is a great revolution. Due to insufficient experience and insufficient investigation and research by the leadership departments, some shortcomings inevitably occurred in this huge transformation process. For example, in the early stage of cooperation, some industries were over-centralized, which caused inconvenience to residents and cooperative members and had a negative impact on production. Some industries accepted orders in batches and implemented planned production, ignoring the fine tradition of handicraft workers providing flexible services according to the needs of residents. Some cooperatives also had large stalls and many management cadres, resulting in extravagance and waste. A very small number of cooperatives have also had bad behaviors such as shoddy work and high prices.

Some of these shortcomings have now been overcome, and some are being actively improved. These are shortcomings in the process of advancement. Just as the sunspots cannot cover up the sun's brilliance, these shortcomings cannot cover up the great achievements of the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

    合作化第一年
    胡道源
    从“缝衣难”谈起
    手工业合作化已经实现了一年多。但是直到现在，还有人怀疑甚至否定手工业合作化的优越性。
    怀疑或否定手工业合作化优越性的人，大都是从跟人民生活关系最密切的缝衣业谈起的。他们说：春天成立了合作社，冬天做衣服就碰到了麻烦。定做一件衣服，要等十多天甚至一个月才能取。在这些人看来，好像“缝衣难”是合作化的坏处。
    去年冬天缝衣难，是不是合作化造成的呢？不但不是，相反，如果没有合作化，去年缝衣服还不晓得要难多少倍。拿上海来说吧，去年全市职工平均工资增长了8％，而且集中在7、8月以后补发；资本家拿了五千六百一十万元的股息；市场布票放宽，布的销售量增加了48％，加上美化生活、提倡时装的宣传，缝衣难的形势就自然形成了。在这种情况下，合作化的优越性充分显示了出来。单就时装说，上海原有能做时装的缝工只有一百九十人，去年在最紧张的时候，手工业社突击培训时装工人，几个月就训练出九百多人。开始每人每天只能做一件，后来每天能够做三件。技术力量的增长和生产率的提高是空前的。总计起来，上海去年生产的衣服比前年增加了40％以上。其他地方的情况也和上海类似。像天津市的缝衣合作社，仅在10和11两个月中，就赶制了棉衣十一万件，如果没有合作化，要做出这样大的成绩是不可想像的。
    同行不再是冤家
    个体手工业者互相竞争，互相排挤，“同行是冤家”。合作化以后，竞争排挤的关系变成了互助合作的关系。社员和社员之间，社和社之间，互相交流经验，共同研究技术，因而创造和仿制了许多新产品，提高了原有产品的质量。1956年长沙市增加了四千五百种新的花色品种；天津市试制了二千三百多种新产品；上海市生产的新产品有三千多种。这里面不仅有简单的生活日用品，而且有精密的仪器和医疗器械。
    公开了祖传的绝技
    “传媳妇不传闺女”，是操有特种技术的手工业者的老规矩。在个体经营的条件下，只有这样才能不受竞争的威胁。多少名牌产品，就是因为这个缘故而人亡艺绝了。合作化以后，手艺人年老了有照顾，子孙后代也不愁没有饭吃，许多著名的老艺人都不再像过去那样“教一手留一手”了。北京市做玻璃葡萄的名艺人常桂禄五姊妹，为了保持祖传的绝技都没有出嫁，操作的时候从不许人看，现在她们入了社，也在带徒弟了。
    淡季不淡了
    有些季节性生产的行业，个体经营的时候，由于资金少，在淡季不能进行储备性生产，经常发生淡季没事干，旺季忙不过来的现象。合作化后，联社可以调剂生产，尽量减少淡季旺季生产忙闲不均的差别。如上海市缝衣业，如果不是市联社在去年冬季适当控制了一部分原料，今年春季的生产是很难维持的。北京市许多手工业社在今年第一季度采取互相调剂使用流动资金的办法，基本上解决了淡季生产资金不足的问题。这样，生产正常了，产品价格也不会因为季节淡旺而暴涨暴跌了。
    解放了生产力
    在摆脱了个体所有制的束缚以后，手工业的生产简直是以惊人的速度前进着。
    实现合作化的第一年——1956年，全国的手工业者为国家创造了一百一十七亿元财富，提前一年完成了第一个五年计划。这个数字，比历史上最高的1954年的产值增长了11.4％，比战前最高的一年——1936年增长了56.9％。（1936年为七十五亿七千万元）同合作化的前一年——（1955年）相比，每个手工业社员的平均年产值提高了33.5％。
    一支不可缺少的力量
    比起大工厂来，小小的手工业社似乎是微不足道的。但是，在国民经济中，这是一支相当重大的、不可缺少的力量。
    1956年，在全部工业总产值中，有16.6％是手工业创造的。全国十万四千多个手工业合作社（组），缴纳了三亿八千多万元的税款。
    各地的手工业社大力生产各种农具，并且普遍组织了农具修配网，来支援农业合作社。在这一年里，手工业合作社生产的农具，平均每个农户可以得到两件多；为农民修补的农具以千万计。
    作为大工业的助手，手工业合作组织，大量生产了各种建筑材料，来支援工业建设。西安市金属制造社在去年一年中为工业部门制造了二千多吨金属建筑附件；辽宁省复县陶瓷生产合作社在一年内制造的陶瓷管，共长三百二十多公里，使基本建设部门节约了一千四百多吨钢铁、七百四十多吨水泥。
    1956年，仅陶瓷和工艺美术品两项，就出口了价值七千三百四十七万多元的商品，给国家换回了不少为建设所必需的外汇。
    合作化提高了生产，也提高了手工业者的生活。
    “过去三个人一条被，现在一个人三条被。”上海市的手工业社社员用这句话来形容他们生活的变化。个体手工业者经不住风吹雨打，淡季没活做要挨饿，一场大病就可以变穷。现在入了社，收入固定了，生活一天天好起来。1956年——合作化的第一年，全国四百七十多万个社员，90％左右都增加了收入。据北京、天津、上海、福建、广西、湖北等省市的典型调查，社员的平均工资一般比入社前提高了15％左右。比较高的如天津市手工业社社员的平均工资增长了22.94％；四川省增长了20％。
    在这一年，合作社的积累也大大增加了。吉林省和上海市的手工业社，1956年即积累了一千万多元。不少合作社实行了公费医疗和医疗补助制度，个别生活困难的社员，还能够得到合作社的补助和救济。
    因此，北京市的手工业社员在听到右派分子的反动言论以后，十分气愤地说：“谁说共产党领导的不好，叫他到我们合作社来看看吧！”
    缺点也是有的
    手工业由个体所有制走向集体所有制，这是一个伟大的革命。由于领导部门经验不足，调查研究不够，在这个巨大的转变过程中，不可避免地发生了一些缺点。例如合作化初期，有些行业过分集中，对居民和社员都造成不便，对生产也起了不好的影响。有些行业成批接受订货，实行有计划的生产，忽视了手工业者根据居民需要灵活服务的优良传统。还有些合作社摊子铺得大，管理干部多，有铺张浪费现象。有极少数的合作社还发生过粗制滥造和高抬价格等不好的行为。
    这些缺点，现在有的已经克服，有的正在积极改进。这是前进中的缺点，正如太阳上的黑点掩盖不了太阳的光辉，这些缺点也掩盖不了手工业的社会主义改造的巨大成就。
