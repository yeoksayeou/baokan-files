With a heavy heart, we have made a preliminary review of the newspaper during this period. Many facts strongly prove that *Wenhui Bao* did indeed become a powerful tool for rightists such as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun to launch a frantic attack on the Party, and became the mouthpiece of the rightists' criminal activities against the Party, the people, and socialism. We have committed a crime against the people and our readers, and we are in debt to them. This is also our utmost shame and humiliation. With a heavy heart, we have made the following preliminary self-criticism and ask readers to continue to help us conduct a thorough examination.

Weren't the rightists trying to seize leadership over intellectuals? In order to seize leadership, didn't they everywhere claim that the Party was an amateur in culture, science, and education, while the rightists were experts? Didn't they say that the Party should retreat from here and there and let the rightists play the role of leaders? Didn't they start fires at the grassroots level, plotting to overthrow the Communist Party? The newspaper meets with the broad masses of readers every day. It is a powerful ideological weapon. In order to achieve their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist goals, the rightists' conspiracy began with usurping the leadership of the newspaper. That is how Xu Zhucheng, the president and editor-in-chief of this newspaper, and Pu Xixiu, the deputy editor-in-chief and director of the Beijing office, under the instructions of the rightists, turned this newspaper into a powerful tool for the rightists to launch a frantic attack on the Party during a certain period.

	**Selling Bourgeois Ideology Immediately After Re-launching**

Because the error was one of principle, the examples of errors are countless. Now, according to the timeline, we will first expose some major examples of errors. Not long after its re-launch, *Wenhui Bao* used the slogan "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to begin selling bourgeois ideas to readers. For example, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, we organized a discussion on film issues. In this discussion, we published a large number of articles that glossed over the achievements of the film industry since liberation, especially Zhu Zhuzhu's "For Progress" and "The Drums of Film," published in *Wenyi Bao*. These two articles portrayed the people's film industry as completely dark. During and after the discussion, some comrades offered their opinions to the newspaper, hoping that we would pay attention to this tendency. However, good advice fell on deaf ears. The editorial department did not pay attention. Verbally, we said several times that we would summarize experiences and learn lessons, but we never put it into practice. Xu Zhucheng, the president and editor-in-chief of this newspaper, even regarded this well-intentioned advice as "suppression" of the newspaper by some comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

	**Publicizing Luo Longji's Fallacies Before the Rectification Began, Sending a Signal to Attack the Party**

As early as this spring, before the Party issued instructions on rectification, signals that provoked the relationship between the Party and intellectuals and prepared to attack the Party appeared in our newspaper. On March 19, the newspaper published a special dispatch from the Beijing office, presided over by Pu Xixiu, the deputy editor-in-chief of this newspaper. This dispatch reported on the speech of rightist ringleader Luo Longji at the CPPCC symposium, saying that eliminating the estrangement between Party members and non-Party members was the key to implementing the policy on intellectuals; and said in an inflammatory tone: Criticizing Party members, whether the criticism is appropriate or not, is not equal to being anti-Party, let alone being counter-revolutionary. It paved the way for the rightists to launch a frantic attack on the Party, and the editorial department actively supported Luo Longji's fallacy by publishing it on the front page with a large headline. Another example is an interview with Pan Guangdan (a member of Luo Longji's rightist clique) written by a reporter from the Beijing office. In this interview, Luo Longji's words were used to viciously say that intellectuals in the past were under a lid, unable to breathe, attempting to stir up dissatisfaction among intellectuals toward the Party. On April 21, a reporter from this newspaper wrote a feature article entitled "Thawing," echoing the so-called "early spring weather" argument, implying that before the "great blooming and contending" it was a world of ice, and that "spring" should come earlier. It negated and glossed over the achievements of the Party's work on intellectuals in the past, and negated and glossed over the Party's meticulous care and love for intellectuals in the past.

	**Using Rectification as a Cover to Launch a Frantic Attack on the Party**

In May of this year, after the Party Central Committee issued instructions on rectification, *Wenhui Bao* became a tool for the rightists to take the opportunity of the Party's rectification to launch a frantic attack on the Party. As Comrade Li Pingyuan justly pointed out when criticizing this newspaper: "In the selection of manuscripts, layout, reporter activities, and news reports, three attitudes were adopted: First, the *Wenhui Bao* editorial department basically adopted a 'negate everything' attitude towards the achievements of socialist construction within the scope of its reporters' reports, and adopted a negative attitude towards the leading role of the Party; second, it adopted an attitude of promoting bourgeois ideas and political views; third, in the cause of letting bloom and contend advocated by the Party, *Wenhui Bao* adopted an attitude of attacking the leadership in many regions of the country (except Beijing and Shanghai), and adopted an attitude of inciting great democracy and provoking Party-mass relations in the cultural and educational circles and among young students." The most notable example of this was the editorial department's attitude of reporting and handling news with a desire to see the world in chaos. For example, regarding Renmin University, from May 17, a reader's letter was published, saying "Why is Renmin University so silent," saying that it is "calm and peaceful, like a paradise." On May 20, "Beijing Air News" was published, making distorted reports about Renmin University, saying that the rectification of Renmin University "has not yet been promoted," and using an inflammatory tone in the title, saying "Some people think that if the situation is to be changed, public opinion pressure is needed." On June 1, in a Xinhua News Agency report, the editor again selectively quoted the title "Renmin University is run in a 'four-not-like'" and the subtitle "University sign, middle school content, primary school teaching method," completely negating the achievements of the entire Renmin University. After the newspaper was published, some people in the editorial department expressed dissatisfaction with this title, but Editor-in-Chief Xu Zhucheng criticized the comrades doing the specific work for putting this news on the second page instead of the first page as the headline.

	**"Wishing-Chaos-for-the-World" Faction Sending People to Start Fires Everywhere**

This erroneous practice of "wishing-chaos-for-the-world" was also manifested in starting fires everywhere and conducting inflammatory reports. In Shanghai, fires were first started in the People's Art Theater, followed by various symposiums for actors from the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater and news reporters, etc., arousing the masses' hostile emotions towards the Party and expanding things. Particularly egregious was the reactionary report on the "Peking University Democracy Wall." Under the instruction of Luo Longji, Pu Xixiu instructed reporters from the Beijing office to send a special dispatch. The deputy editor-in-chief on duty, Comrade Liu Huozi, believed that this report was inflammatory and would cause chaos, so he withheld it. As a result, Pu Xixiu asked the reporter in Beijing to write another newsletter. Originally, the editorial department was not prepared to publish it. However, Xu Zhucheng repeatedly emphasized that Pu Xixiu was the deputy editor-in-chief, and all articles and news designated by her must be published, and no one could withhold them. After this newsletter was sent, Pu Xixiu called from Beijing, saying that *Guangming Daily* was going to publish it, and we must publish it too. In this way, it was decided to tear down the already typeset page and publish this "Democracy Wall." A few days later, the Beijing office sent another report on the "Democracy Wall"; the editors advocated not publishing it, but Xu Zhucheng said it should be published, just change the title and do not mention "Democracy Wall," but in fact the article still talked about this issue. This report was published in this way. The report on the "Democracy Wall" caused great chaos in universities across the country.

The scope of starting fires not only spread to major cities across the country, but also wanted to start fires at the grassroots level. The Party had clearly pointed out in the instructions on rectification that this rectification should first start from Party organizations above the county level and army units above the regimental level, as well as Party organizations in large factories and mines and colleges and universities, and should first start from examining the ideology and work style of leading cadres. At the closing meeting of the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference, Ke Qingshi, the First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, reiterated this spirit in his concluding remarks, stating that the grassroots level would not be rectified for the time being. However, when this news was published on May 21, on the one hand, we did not highlight such an important issue in the title; on the other hand, on the same day, we published an article by rightist ambitious Wang Zaoshi "Putting the focus of letting bloom and contend on the grassroots level," attempting to disrupt the rectification steps and advocating "setting fires" at the grassroots level. This expanded the influence of the rightists' fallacies and reduced the influence of the Party's correct instructions among the masses.

After the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference closed, Xu Zhucheng had a sense of resistance to the instructions not to rectify at the grassroots level, but knowing that he could no longer mess around in Shanghai, he advocated sending reporters to start fires elsewhere. First, he sent reporters to Hangzhou. Before the reporters left, Xu Zhucheng gave four points of instruction in person: (1) According to Song Yunbin's letter, the problems in Hangzhou are still very serious, and we must continue to "remove the lid"; (2) The scope of interviews should be expanded, not just limited to the literary and art circles; (3) We must listen to the grievances of middle and primary school teachers, and we can go deep into the special districts and counties to hold symposiums; (4) Shanghai will not be easy to work in from now on, but we must continue to work in the local areas. Xu Zhucheng also fabricated rumors that Chen Xuezhao "has been forced to Haining (referring to the Party committee)," and asked the reporter to find her in Haining. Therefore, in addition to Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Xinjiang, and other regions that already had reporters or special correspondents, reporters were also sent to Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other places to start fires. The editorial department also instructed reporters in various places to hold teachers' symposiums to "give opinions" to the Ministry of Education, and made many reports that distorted the facts. Starting fires in every place almost always created opposition to the local Party committee, saying that the Party committee was "still high walls," "shrinking back," and describing the local political atmosphere as "still warm," without "spring breeze," "dark clouds but no rain," "unremoved lid," and so on, forming an attack on the Party's leadership and creating a tense atmosphere.

	**Provoking Party-Masses Relations and Inciting Party Members to Betray the Party**

This kind of fire-starting also attempted to extend to the inside of the Communist Party. Many newsletters, news reports, and articles not only slandered the Party and negated the Party's achievements, but even incited Party members to deviate from the Party's line and policy. Xu Zhucheng's own "The 'Wall' Can Be Demolished" is a notable example. Here, he described past newspapers as "full of dogmas and clichés," and openly introduced opposing the Party, not accepting the Party's leadership, and driving away Party member responsible cadres as "experiences in demolishing the wall." In addition, there were Yang Zhaolong's "Between Party and Non-Party in the Legal Profession," Shi Zhecun's "Talent and Virtue," Tian Yuan's "Opinions on the People's Daily Editor's Note," Xu Junyuan's "Should Newspapers Continue to Do This Way?" Hu Mingshu's "What's Wrong with Killing Bureaucracy with One Blow?" Song Yunbin's "From a Miscellaneous Essay to Satire (plus one chapter)," Pan Jiǒng's "The Storm of Dear Mr.," Shan Yunpeng's "Put Down Grandma's Attitude," and so on. Yang Zhaolong arbitrarily spread the fallacies of reactionary British and American scholars in his articles, vilified worker-peasant cadres, and provoked Party-mass relations. Shi Zhecun recklessly insulted national leading cadres in his articles, and openly cursed Party member responsible cadres as lacking talent and "morality." Tian Yuan's article described the People's Daily's addition of an editor's note to Lei Haizong's absurd remarks, hoping that everyone would discuss it, as "building a high wall," and believed that such poisonous weeds should also be "diligently fertilized and irrigated." Xu Junyuan's article completely negated the achievements of newspaper work since liberation, saying "only talking about dogmas," and even insulting the Party newspaper as "showing the face of a Party member, without a smile." Hu Mingshu and Song Yunbin's articles advocated killing with a stick "all at once," which in essence advocated rudeness and opposed the Party's repeated warning to us to conduct rectification and treat comrades with gentle and gentle methods. Even more erroneous, on May 3, it also published "Beijing Letters" by reporters stationed in Beijing and "Party Members Also Have Grievances" on May 23, attempting to encourage Party members to "rebel" and betray the Party as the rightists said.

During this period, a large number of newsletters and articles expressing bourgeois reactionary views were also published without any intention of refuting them. One notable example is "Liu Shahe Talks About 'Grass and Wood'." It is well known that "Grass and Wood" is a poisonous weed, a poisonous arrow attacking socialism. However, the reporter from this newspaper in the southwest stood on Liu Shahe's position and wrote an interview that reversed right and wrong and falsely accused others of "violating personal freedom," causing some readers who did not know the truth to write letters from afar to the Party organization of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles to express their opinions, causing confusion. Subsequently, the reporter also sent multiple special dispatches on the discussion of "Grass and Wood" by the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, repeatedly defending Liu Shahe's erroneous ideas.

	**Using Sensational Headlines to Exaggerate and Incite to the Fullest**

In terms of layout, it also prominently expressed the reactionary nature of being anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. In the headlines, no effort was spared to be sensational and exaggerate and incite to the fullest, such as "The Ministry of Education Promotes Dogmatism with Commandism," "Unclear Policies, Five Disorders, Teachers Died of Busyness, Students Died of Tiredness," "Waves of Wind Blow Teachers Dizzy, How the Policy Is Implemented Is Still Not Clear Below," "Three Major -isms Like Mount Tai Pressing Down, Liu Fei Pleads for Middle and Primary School Teachers," and "Official Style Overwhelms Academic Style." It said that "Literary and art departments regard flowers as poisonous weeds," "Experts are attacked, cultural relics are despised," North Film actors criticize the Film Bureau for "wasting youth, burying talents," "Sectarianism hinders artistic creation," "The Science and Technology Publishing House forms an independent kingdom," saying "Shanghai's health department has crisscrossing ditches," saying that medical personnel "have no sympathy, and there are beatings and scoldings," and described the Foreign Languages ​​Publishing House and other units as dark and without light. In higher education departments, it frantically clamored to "abolish the Party committee system," and put forward the fallacies of "democratic school management" and "professor governance of the school." In the science department, it also put forward the absurd slogan of "scientists governing the institute (Academy of Sciences)." These headlines and reports became vanguards for the rightists to usurp leadership.

	**Deliberately Publishing Chairman Mao's Important Speech in an Extremely Inconspicuous Way**

The headlines quoted above are some examples. There are also some more prominent examples. For example, on May 25, when Chairman Mao met with youth representatives, he made an important speech, pointing out: "All words and deeds that deviate from socialism are completely wrong." Chairman Mao's speech gave 600 million people a standard for distinguishing between right and wrong. This speech, published when the rightists were trying to undermine the foundation of socialism, had extremely realistic and combative significance. However, we regarded it as ordinary news, and even published it in an extremely inconspicuous short column, devaluing the important significance of Chairman Mao's speech.

	**Deliberately Elaborating on Chu Anping's Fallacies, Omitting He Xiangning's Just Words**

The layout of the newspaper on June 2 was the most egregious layout. What was published that day was news of the last meeting of the United Front Work Department's symposium for heads of democratic parties. At the meeting, the revolutionary veteran He Xiangning made an important written speech. In her speech, she analyzed the situation of the left, middle, and right factions, and put forward two hopes: First, the members of the Communist Party of China should be determined in the rectification to accept correct opinions from all aspects to improve their work; second, they hoped that the democratic parties would sincerely help the Communist Party. And she emphasized: "If anyone is whimsical, it will run counter to the original intention of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." There is no doubt that Comrade He Xiangning's speech was to enlighten some whimsical rightists and give a stern warning to the anti-socialist evil wind. However, we did not send a special dispatch of the full text of such an important speech. On the contrary, under the instruction of Pu Xixiu, the full text of the speech by rightist Chu Anping on the same day, slandering the Party and advocating the abolition of the Party's leadership, was sent from Beijing to Shanghai in a special dispatch; the newspaper's headline for the news of He Xiangning's speech only marked her first hope, and it was handled in a way that deviated from the original intention; as for her enlightenment to the rightists, it was omitted. For Chu Anping's anti-Party fallacies, under the decision of Xu Zhucheng, they were even surrounded by borders and prominently published. It fully showed the extremely clear reactionary nature of our news layout. Such handling was to oppose progressive remarks and serve the rightists. In addition, when Lu Yuwen was intimidated by reactionary elements with anonymous letters for saying some fair words based on facts, we did not express due indignation; when the Jiu San Society internally refuted Chu Anping's anti-Party remarks, we reported a large amount of the rightists' opinions in the news, and the headline also appeared to be fair, saying: "Ideological Peak in the Jiu San Society." The rightist Sun Dayu slandered Comrades Chen Qiwei, Zhang Jinyi, Qi Qisheng, Quan Zenghu and others as "counter-revolutionaries." We published the full text of his speech, without criticism in the title; afterwards, because Xu Zhucheng did not agree with the reporter's writing, Chen Qiwei, Zhang Jinyi, Qi Qisheng and other comrades' opinions refuting Sun Dayu were not reflected. For the incident of Professor Da Yijin's speech at Fudan University being unreasonably obstructed, we regarded it as "a small storm," and the headline even came out with an insignificant attitude. It created a situation in the masses where there was no standard of right and wrong, and even what was wrong became right, and what was black became white.
			×××

The facts revealed above have irrefutably proved that *Wenhui Bao* did commit unpardonable political errors in the past short period and became a powerful tool for rightist ambitious elements Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism. This heartbreaking fact, tracing the roots, is inseparable from the collusion between Pu Xixiu, the deputy editor-in-chief of this newspaper and director of the Beijing office, and the reactionary alliance of rightist ambitious elements Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun. This is exactly as the People's Daily editorial on July 1 mentioned: The line of Luo Longji—Pu Xixiu—Wenhui Bao editorial department usurped the political direction of *Wenhui Bao*.

The newspapers of socialist countries have different roles due to different divisions of labor. However, standing firmly on the position of the working class, publicizing and implementing the Party's policies, and safeguarding the interests of the working class and the people of the whole country are common points that any newspaper in a socialist country must have.

*Wenhui Bao* is a newspaper aimed at intellectuals. Among the more than five million intellectuals in our country, the rightists who are not very welcome to socialism and hold hostile sentiments are, after all, a minority. The vast majority of intellectuals are patriots, they support socialism and support the Communist Party. Among these intellectuals, some people are not very clear about how to work under the socialist system, and how to solve many new problems; some people are not very accustomed to Marxism-Leninism. As a newspaper aimed at intellectuals, it should, based on this situation, under the leadership of the Party, stand firmly on the position of the working class, influence and help intellectuals, so that they gradually master Marxism-Leninism and gradually establish the working class's and communist world view. This is the fundamental task of this newspaper. Before the re-launch in October last year, under the guidance and help of the Party, this basic policy had been determined. And during the re-launch period, we also did some work under the guidance of this correct policy.

However, under the instruction of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji reactionary alliance, Pu Xixiu gradually tampered with this policy, and finally, during the "great blooming and contending" period, made the entire newspaper a tool for the rightists to launch a frantic attack on the Party, and become anti-socialist and anti-people.

	**Pu Xixiu Inherited Zhang and Luo's Intent to Implement the Rightist Line in *Wenhui Bao***

The close relationship between Pu Xixiu and Luo Longji is well known. On the eve of the re-launch of *Wenhui Bao* last year, Luo Longji invited Pu Xixiu to go to Beidaihe together. After the re-launch of *Wenhui Bao*, Pu Xixiu implemented the reactionary views of Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun in the newspaper work. Pu Xixiu did not lean towards the Party, but asked rightist ambitious elements such as Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun for instructions on everything, and arranged the work of the Beijing office of this newspaper. She also often carried out "conveying" in the Beijing office. The inspection now proves that what she "conveyed" was not the instructions of the Party Central Committee, but the instructions of rightist Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. In this way, the editors and reporters of the Beijing office were led to the wrong path in performing their work. Sometimes, Luo Longji even directly issued orders to the Beijing office of this newspaper, and even arrogantly rebuked reporters, saying that they should not have sent certain news to Shanghai in a special dispatch. The rampant nature of his activities can be seen from this.

Pu Xixiu used this condition to serve Luo Longji's rightist clique, excluding the articles and related news reports of progressive people. This inevitably made *Wenhui Bao* deviate from the correct policy. She never organized progressive people to write articles herself. Even if reporters wanted to organize such articles, she would oppose them. The example of Comrade Deng Chumin is the most prominent. During the Propaganda Conference, Deng Chumin published an article in this newspaper, "My Understanding of the Spirit of Chairman Mao's Speech," proposing that there should be a big debate after the big blooming and contending. This argument was completely correct, but Pu Xixiu scolded it as "dogmatism" and believed that such articles should not be published; Xu Zhucheng also thought so, and even called the Shanghai editorial department by long distance, saying that these manuscripts should be "paid attention to" in the future. On the same day that Chu Anping made fallacies at the symposium of the Central United Front Work Department, Deng Chumin also spoke at the meeting, saying some fair words. The reporter planned to send a special dispatch, but Pu Xixiu did not agree, but instructed the reporter to send out the full text of Chu Anping's fallacies. The speeches of Comrade Chen Yuan and some other democratic people at the United Front Work Department were also prevented by Pu Xixiu because they did not meet the rightists' intentions, and the reporter was not allowed to send special dispatches. In daily work, Pu Xixiu planned to pull reporters to the right. For example, she sent reporters to follow rightist clique members Pan Guangdan to go out for "inspections," and sent reporters to collect and write "interviews" with rightist clique members Li Jinghan, Wu Jingchao, and Pan Guangdan. When reporters proposed to organize articles by some progressive people, Pu Xixiu either obstructed them in every possible way or did not support them, often using the four words "dogmatism" to dismiss them. Since the end of May, the editorial board has repeatedly instructed the Beijing office to organize some positive rational articles and news, and also put forward some object of collecting articles. The Party Group Secretary and Deputy Editor-in-Chief also personally called Pu Xixiu by long distance. However, Pu Xixiu prevented reporters from the Beijing office from organizing articles by Wu Han and other comrades, and under the guise of so-called "persuading people with reason," she personally went to organize articles written by Fei Xiaotong and Lou Bangyan, in order to cover up for Chu Anping.

These activities of Pu Xixiu proved that she used her authority in this newspaper to implement the rightists' line and drag *Wenhui Bao* to a dead end.

	**Xu Zhucheng Resisted the Party's Leadership in Everything, Competing with Chu Anping to See Who Was More Right**

While Pu Xixiu was carrying out anti-Party activities, Xu Zhucheng, the president and editor-in-chief of *Wenhui Bao* in Shanghai, also implemented the line of rightist ambitious elements. He resisted the Party's leadership, opposed Marxism in the name of opposing "dogmatism"; glossed over the Party's achievements by opposing "two-point theory"; advocated starting fires at the grassroots level, and proposed "singing a different tune," and insisted on the reactionary arrangement of certain pages.

When *Wenhui Bao* was re-launched, Xu Zhucheng drove away two Party member responsible comrades as his "experience in demolishing the wall." He not only talked about this with relish, but also used it as the content of his speech at the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference; he also wrote it into an article and published it in the newspaper. During the Shanghai Propaganda Conference, the Party discovered that rightist elements were taking advantage of the rectification movement to launch a frenzied attack. The *Wenhui Bao* Party Group held an enlarged meeting to discuss the current newspaper work and invited Xu Zhucheng to participate. At this meeting, a correct decision had been made. However, Xu Zhucheng did not accept the Party's leadership and did not implement the Party's decision. After the Shanghai Propaganda Work Conference closed, Ke Qingshi, the First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally talked with Xu Zhucheng, saying that the policy was only to let go and not to take back, but hoped to pay attention to the evil wind. However, Xu Zhucheng believed that Shanghai's approach was "taking back" and was "not in line" with the spirit of the central government. He said that he was not prepared to write an editorial until the overall policy was clear. And he said that we all have political experience and cannot fall with the wind. During this period, Shi Ximin, the Minister of Propaganda of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, also talked with him, but there was a lack of common language. The responsible comrades of the Party Group of this newspaper also talked with him several times, but there was no effect. Xu Zhucheng used so-called "independent thinking"—which was essentially resisting the Party's leadership—to guide the work of the editorial department, dragging the newspaper onto the rightist path. Because the newspaper took a reactionary path, many comrades in the editorial department expressed indignation and dissatisfaction, and repeatedly asked to re-clarify the policy of this newspaper and decide on the current practice. The editorial board held two meetings on June 3 and 5 respectively, specifically to discuss the issue of policy. At the first meeting, Xu Zhucheng even raised the question of how to "compete" with the *Guangming Daily* hosted by Chu Anping, and put forward the absurd proposition of "singing a different tune." At that time, most members of the editorial board pointed out: There is only one main theme, there should be no "different tune"; the tradition of *Wenhui Bao* is to adhere to the position of progressive intellectuals, and this position should not be abandoned; we should not compete with Chu Anping to see who is more right, but should start from a progressive position and guide readers forward. Despite the fierce debate, and most members of the editorial board agreed with the correct proposition, Xu Zhucheng was unwilling to turn the newspaper back from the rightist path. Therefore, he said that the issue would be discussed again at the second editorial board meeting. At the second editorial board meeting, Xu Zhucheng remained silent on the issue of policy, saying that this issue should be taken to the "central government" for research, but proposed the so-called "division of labor issue," squeezing the work of the Party Group Secretary and Deputy Editor-in-Chief to only manage the second page and "Social University" and "Education Life." In daily work, when Party member responsible cadres were performing their duties, Xu Zhucheng attacked them with the so-called hat of "Party replacing administration." In this way, the Party's leadership was canceled, and the Party's intentions could not be implemented in the editorial department; the rightists' propositions could run rampant, and erroneous ideas dominated the editorial department.

During this period, Xu Zhucheng directly interfered in editorial affairs, deciding on the selection of manuscripts and implementing the reactionary policy. For example, after the chief editor received the special dispatch of Chu Anping's fallacies, he thought it needed to be considered; however, Xu Zhucheng sent it directly to the editor and instructed it to be "boxed and published on the front page"; another example is the report on the "Peking University Democracy Wall," Pu Xixiu sent it, and the editor did not agree to publish it, but Xu Zhucheng wanted to publish it. Pu Xixiu said that Comrade Deng Chumin's manuscript was "dogmatic," and Xu Zhucheng also said it was "dogmatic," and there was one article that he had not even read, so he told the editor to pay attention to Deng Chumin's "dogmatism." Xu Zhucheng was not satisfied with the publication of the speeches of Comrades Chen Wangdao and Jin Zhonghua at the Shanghai Propaganda Conference, and repeatedly criticized the editor; Xu Zhucheng was also not satisfied with the failure to publish the speech by reporter Lu Wen of this newspaper attacking the Party, and he also repeatedly criticized the editorial department, even raising it at the enlarged meeting of the editorial board. There was an article written by a university professor, more than 3,000 words in total, only 200 or 300 words talked about the need for intellectuals to reform, and the rest were criticisms of the Party's work; Xu Zhucheng insisted on deleting those 200 or 300 words, otherwise he would not agree to publish it. An editorial board member wrote an editorial about gentle rain and breeze based on the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on the rectification movement. Xu Zhucheng expressed disagreement with such an editorial and even withheld it during the review. When the editor made a positive headline, Xu Zhucheng repeatedly criticized it as "two-point theory—dogma." Whenever he talked about positive opinions, he invariably called them "taking back," thereby negating positive opinions. These erroneous practices and reactionary opinions caused great harm in the editorial department, making *Wenhui Bao* a counter-socialist newspaper in the previous period.

From the above examples, it can be seen how Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng implemented the policies of the Zhang and Luo reactionary alliance and tampered with the originally correct policies of this newspaper; it can also be seen the most fundamental reason for this newspaper's serious mistakes.

	**Many Editors and Reporters Had Serious Bourgeois Ideology, Leading to Being Captured by Rightist Ambitious Elements**

In addition to the above-mentioned fundamental reasons, the reason why *Wenhui Bao* has committed such serious mistakes is also that many comrades in the newspaper's editorial department have serious bourgeois ideology and serious bourgeois journalistic views. If not, Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng's fallacies would not have found a market; if not, their reactionary words and deeds would have been exposed long ago; if not, the struggle with them in the past few days would not have been so weak; the editorial department could not have been shrouded in black fog. Therefore, when we look back at the crooked road we have traveled in the past, we see the filth in the souls of some of us and feel infinite shame; we owe a debt to the people and have committed a crime, which is very painful to say.

In the editorial department of this newspaper, many are so-called "old journalists" who came from the old society. Although they have undergone ideological transformation movements and made initial criticisms of bourgeois ideas and bourgeois journalistic views, they have not been transformed well, have not worked hard to study Marxism, transform their thinking, and master the communist world view. The thoughts and feelings of many people have not yet been transferred to the working class.

Since the re-launch of this newspaper in October last year, many mistakes have been made sporadically on the newspaper's layout. Some headlines were unilaterally exaggerated, so that the title did not match the text, distorting the content of the news. For example, Indian President Prasad said that he had read the report of the personnel who inspected agriculture from India to China, and is currently considering taking measures based on this report. But our headline was "India Will Take the Same Measures as China in Agriculture." In the film discussion, certain revisionist biases have already appeared (not only were articles that glossed over achievements such as Zhu Zhuzhu's published, but also the parts of Comrade Zhao Dan's article that talked about the achievements of film work were deleted), but we did not conduct in-depth inspections and take it as a warning; in the several problem discussions organized since then, the majority of negative opinions often outnumbered the positive opinions, forming a one-sided situation. At that time, these problems were only seen as individual problems, and they were not deeply pursued from the ideological point of view and seriously criticized. During the "blooming and contending" period, this bourgeois thought became increasingly prominent. During Xu Zhucheng's absence abroad, the erroneous thoughts of the editorial department had been active; after Xu Zhucheng returned to China, due to his manipulation, some erroneous thoughts developed to a rather serious degree.

Due to unstable positions and serious bourgeois ideas, therefore, in many members of the editorial board, editors, reporters, and the editorial committee, the understanding of the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is not deep; the understanding of "great blooming and contending" as a class struggle in the ideological field—later developed into a class struggle in the political field—is not clear. Due to the influence of bourgeois thought, many comrades have confused the principled differences between bourgeois democracy and socialist democracy; and confused the principled differences between newspapers in capitalist countries and newspapers in socialist countries. As a result, serious errors have been made, becoming prisoners of rightist ambitious elements, participating in the ranks of attacking the Party, causing significant damage to the Party and the people's cause.

"Grass and Wood" is a poisonous weed, and a correct conclusion has been reached. However, our reporter Fan Yan wanted to interview Liu Shahe with a so-called "objective" attitude. His plan was actually approved by the editorial board; a newsletter was written standing on Liu Shahe's position, falsely accusing others of "violating personal freedom," and after being reviewed by the editorial board comrades, it was also decided to publish it. Zuo Ye, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, had shortcomings in his attitude towards reporters. This newspaper not only sent a special dispatch from Beijing and wrote an editorial on this matter; but also continuously published many miscellaneous essays lacking a kind attitude towards people (including short articles in the "Hall of Public Opinion"), attacking him in a concentrated manner; later, a reporter symposium was also held in Shanghai, putting forward "criticisms" of many people and many units, which in essence was to demand bourgeois "freedom of the press

    文汇报编辑部的初步检查
    我们以沉痛的心情初步检查了这一个时期的报纸，许多事实强有力地证明了文汇报在这个时期确实变成了右派分子罗隆基、章伯钧等向党猖狂进攻的有力工具，成为右派分子反党反人民反社会主义的罪恶活动的喉舌，我们在人民和读者面前犯了罪，欠了债。这也是我们的奇耻大辱，我们以沉重的心情作了如下的初步检查，并请读者继续帮助我们作深入的检查。
    右派分子不是企图抢夺知识分子的领导权么？为了夺取领导权，他们不是到处说党对文化、科学、教育是外行而右派分子是内行么？不是说党应该从这里、从那里撤退而让右派分子来扮演领导者么？他们不是点火到基层，阴谋整垮共产党么？报纸每天和广大读者见面，它是一种强有力的思想武器，右派分子为了实现反党反人民反社会主义的目的，他们的阴谋活动也就首先从篡夺报纸的领导权着手。正是这样，本报社长兼总编辑徐铸成和副总编辑兼北京办事处主任浦熙修在右派分子的指使下，就使本报在一个时期内沦为右派分子向党猖狂进攻的有力武器。
    刚刚复刊就贩卖资产阶级思想
    由于错误是路线性的，因此，错误的实例不胜枚举。现在按照时间，先把一些主要的错误例子揭发出来。文汇报复刊不久，就利用“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的口号，开始向读者贩卖资产阶级思想。例如，去年年底和今年年初，我们组织了电影问题的讨论。在这个讨论中，我们大量刊登了一些抹煞解放以来电影事业成绩的文章，特别是刊登了朱煮竹所写的“为了前进”和转载了发表在文艺报上的“电影的锣鼓”。这两篇文章，将人民的电影事业描写得一团漆黑。在讨论期间和以后，有同志向本报提出意见，希望我们注意这种倾向。然而，忠言逆耳，编辑部没有重视，口头上说过几次要总结经验、吸取教训，始终没有付诸实行。本报社长兼总编辑徐铸成，甚至把这种善意的意见看成是中共上海市委一些同志对本报的“压制”。
    整风没开始就宣传罗隆基的谬论，发出向党进攻的讯号
    还在今年春天，党还没有发布整风指示，在我们的报上就出现了挑拨党与知识分子的关系、准备向党进攻的讯号。三月十九日，报纸刊出了由本报副总编辑浦熙修主持下的北京办事处发来的专电。这则专电，报道了右派首脑罗隆基在政协座谈会上的发言，说什么消除党与非党的隔膜，是贯彻知识分子政策的关键；并且以煽动的口吻说：批评党员，不管批评得是否妥当，不等于反党，更不等于反革命。为右派分子向党猖狂进攻开路，而编辑部以大字标题在第一版刊出，积极支持了罗隆基的这种谬论。又如北京办事处的记者写了一篇潘光旦（罗隆基右派小集团成员之一）的访问记。在这篇访问记中，借用罗隆基的话恶毒地说知识分子过去压在盖子下面，喘不过气来，企图借此煽起知识分子对党不满的情绪。在四月二十一日，本报记者写了一篇题为“解冻”的特写，以与所谓“早春天气”的论点相呼应，暗示“大鸣大放”之前是冰封世界，要“春天”早些到来。否定和抹煞了过去党对知识分子工作的成绩，否定和抹煞了过去党对知识分子工作的成绩，党对知识分子无微不至的关怀和爱护。
    借整风为幌子向党猖狂进攻
    今年五月，当党中央发表了整风指示之后，文汇报更成了右派分子乘党整风的机会向党猖狂进攻的工具。正如李平原同志在批评本报时所公正指出的：“稿件选择、版面处理、记者活动、新闻报道中，采取了三种态度：第一，文汇报编辑部对自己的记者所报道范围内的社会主义建设成就，基本上是采取‘否定一切’的态度，对党的领导作用采取了否定的态度；第二，对于资产阶级思想和政治主张，采取了宣扬的态度；第三，在党倡导放、鸣的事业中，文汇报对全国许多地区（除北京、上海以外）的领导，采取了打击的态度，对文教界和青年学生，采取了煽动大民主、挑拨党群关系的态度。”其中最显著的例子是，编辑部以唯恐天下不乱的态度，进行报道和处理新闻。如对于人民大学，从五月十七日起，刊出了一封读者来信，说“人民大学为何寂然无声”，说它“风平浪静，俨然世外桃源”。到了五月二十日，又发表了“北京航讯”，进行了对人民大学的歪曲报道，说人民大学整风“还未推开”，并且在标题中以煽动的口气说“有人认为如要改变局面需要舆论压力”。到了六月一日，在新华社报道中，编辑又断章取义地标出“人民大学办得‘四不像’”的标题和“大学招牌、中学内容、小学教学方法”的副题，将整个人民大学的成绩一笔予以抹煞。报纸出版后，编辑部已有人对这标题表示不满，但总编辑徐铸成却批评做具体工作的同志为什么将这条新闻放在第二版而不放在第一版作头条。
    唯恐天下不乱派人到处点火
    这种唯恐天下不乱的错误做法，还表现到处点火，进行煽动性的报道。在上海，首先在人民艺术剧院点火，接着又举行了上海京剧院演员、新闻记者等各种座谈会，鼓动起群众对党的敌对情绪，把事情扩大化。尤其恶劣的，是关于“北大民主墙”的反动报道。在罗隆基授意之下浦熙修指示北京办事处的记者曾经发过一个专电，值班副总编辑刘火子同志认为这种报道带有煽动性，会造成混乱，因此扣压下来了。于是，浦熙修再叫在北京的记者又写了一篇通讯。本来编辑部是不准备刊登的。但徐铸成曾一再强调，说浦熙修是副总编辑，凡是经她指定的文章、新闻，都要发表，任何人不得扣掉。这篇通讯寄到后，浦熙修从北京打长途电话来，说“光明日报”要登了，我们也一定要登。这样，才决定将已拼好的版子拆掉，登出了这篇“民主墙”。隔了几天，北京办事处又寄来了有关“民主墙”的报道；编辑同志主张不登，但徐铸成说应该登，只是改一个标题，不提“民主墙”，实际上文内还是谈到这个问题。这篇报道就这样刊登了。有关“民主墙”的报道刊出之后，在全国高等学校造成了极大的混乱。
    点火的范围，不仅遍及全国各主要城市，而且还要点火到基层。党在整风指示中早就明确指出：这次整风，应该首先从县级以上、军队团级以上的党的组织以及大的厂矿和大专学校的党组织开始，并且应该首先从检查领导干部的思想作风开始。中共上海市委宣传会议闭幕会上，市委第一书记柯庆施同志在总结发言中重申了这一精神，说明目前基层暂时不整风。但是，在5月21日刊出这条新闻的时候，一方面，我们没有将这样重要的问题在标题上显示出来；而另方面，就在同一天的报纸上，却刊出了右派野心分子王造时“把放鸣的重点放到基层去”企图打乱整风步骤，主张在基层“放火”的文章。这样，就扩大了右派分子谬论的影响，缩小了党的正确指示在群众中的影响。
    上海宣传工作会议闭幕以后，徐铸成对于基层不整风的指示有抵触情绪，但又知道不能再在上海乱搞，于是主张派记者到外地放火。首先派记者到杭州去。记者临行之前，徐铸成当面指示四点：（一）接宋云彬来信，杭州问题还很严重，要继续“揭盖子”；（二）采访面要扩大，不要光搞文艺界；（三）要听取中、小学教师的苦闷，可以深入到专区、县，开些座谈会；（四）今后上海不大好搞了，地方上则要继续搞。徐铸成还造谣说陈学昭“已经被人（指党委）迫到海宁去了”，要记者到海宁去找她。于是，除原已有记者或特约记者的北京、重庆、成都、广州、南京、新疆等等地区之外，又派出了记者到杭州、镇江、扬州等地点火。编辑部还指示各地记者召开教师座谈会，向教育部“提意见”，进行过不少歪曲事实的报道。而在每一个地方放火，差不多都和当地党委闹对立，把党委说成是“高墙仍在”、“缩手缩脚”，把当地的政治空气描写成“似暖还寒”，没有“春风”，“密云不雨”，“未揭盖子”等等。形成打击党的领导，制造紧张空气。
    挑拨党群关系煽动党员叛党
    这种放火，还企图放到共产党内部。有不少通讯、新闻和文章，不仅污蔑党，否定党的成绩，甚至还要煽动党员脱离党的方针路线。徐铸成自己写的“‘墙’是能够拆的”，这是一个显著的例子，在这里，他把过去的报纸说成是“满纸教条和八股”，把反对党、不接受党的领导，赶走党员负责干部当作“拆墙经验”来公开介绍。此外，还有杨兆龙的“法律界党与非党之间”、施蛰存的“才与德”、田园的“对人民日报编者按的意见”、许君远的“报纸应当这样干下去吗？”胡明树的“能一棍子打死官僚主义，又有何不可？”宋云彬的“从一篇杂文谈到讽刺（外一章）”，潘际埛的“亲爱的先生之风波”，单云鹏的“放下婆婆的架子”等等。杨兆龙在文章中恣意散播英美反动学者的谬论，丑化工农干部，挑拨党群关系。施蛰存在文章中放肆地污辱国家领导干部，公然咒骂党员负责干部没有才和“缺德”。田园的文章，把人民日报在雷海宗的荒谬言论中加上按语希望大家讨论，说成是“筑了一道高墙”，认为对那样的毒草也要“勤加施肥灌溉”。许君远的文章完全抹煞解放以来报纸工作的成绩，说什么“只顾说教条”，甚至辱骂党报“摆着党员面孔，没有笑容”。胡明树、宋云彬的文章，主张用棍子“一下子打死”，实质上就是主张粗暴，反对党所一再告诫我们用和风细雨的方法进行整风，对待同志。更为错误的，五月三日还登载了本报驻北京记者的“北京书简”以及五月二十三日的“党员同志也有苦衷”等文章，企图鼓动像右派分子所说的要党员“起义”，要党员叛党。
    在此期间，还发表了大量的表现资产阶级反动观点，而不准备批驳的通讯和文章。显著的例子之一，是本报记者所写的“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”。“草木篇”是毒草，是向社会主义进攻的毒箭，这是尽人皆知的了。但在西南的本报记者站在流沙河的立场，写了访问记，颠倒是非，诬蔑别人“侵犯人身自由”，致使一些不明真相的读者远道写信给四川省文联的党组织提意见，弄得皂白不分。接着，记者还连续拍发多次有关四川文联讨论“草木篇”的专电，一再为流沙河的错误思想辩护。
    用耸人听闻的标题尽夸大煽动的能事
    在版面的处理上，也突出地表现了反党、反人民、反社会主义的反动性质。在标题上，不惜耸人听闻、尽夸大煽动的能事，如“教育部以命令主义推行教条主义”，“政策不明、五乱为害、教师忙死、学生累死”、“一阵阵风刮得教师晕头转向，方针如何贯彻下面还不明白”、“三大主义如泰山压顶，刘非为中小教师请命”、“官风压倒学风”。说“文艺部门把鲜花当毒草”、“专家受打击、文物遭轻视”、北影演员批评电影局“浪费青春、埋没才能”、“宗派主义妨碍美术创作”、“科技出版社形成独立王国”，说“上海卫生部门墙沟纵横”，说医务界人士“体谅无人、打骂有之”，并且把外文出版社等单位描写得暗无天日。在高等教育部门，疯狂叫嚣要“取消党委制”，提出什么“民主办校”“教授治校”的谬论。在科学部门，也提出所谓“科学家治院（科学院）”的荒谬口号。这些标题和报道成了替右派分子篡夺领导权打先锋。
    故意把毛主席的重要讲话登得极不显著
    上面引的一些标题，是其中一部分例子。还有一些更为突出的例子。如五月二十五日，毛主席在接见青年代表的时候，作了重要的讲话，指出：“一切离开社会主义的言论行动是完全错误的。”毛主席的讲话，给六亿人民指示了分清大是大非的一个标准。这个讲话，发表在右派分子妄图破坏社会主义基础的时候，具有极其现实的战斗的意义。然而，我们把它看成是一般的新闻，竟然用极不显著的短栏刊出，贬低了毛主席这一讲话的重要意义。
    对储安平的谬论加意渲染，对何香凝的正义之言略而不提
    六月二日本报的版面，是一个最恶劣的版面。当天刊出的，是统战部召开民主党派负责人座谈会最后一次会议的新闻，会上，革命的老前辈何香凝作了重要的书面发言。她在发言中，分析了左、中、右派的情况，提出了两点希望：第一、中国共产党的党员要在整风中下决心，接纳各方面正确的意见，来改进工作；第二、希望民主党派诚诚恳恳帮助共产党。并且强调指出：“如果有人想入非非，那就和长期共存、互相监督的原意背道而驰了。”毫无疑义，何香凝同志的发言，是对一些想入非非的右派分子晓以大义，对反社会主义的歪风，予以严正的警告。但是，对于这样重要的发言，我们并没有以专电拍发全文，相反，却在浦熙修的指使下，从北京将右派分子储安平在同一天会上污蔑党，主张取消党的领导的发言全文以专电发到上海；报纸对于何香凝的发言的新闻标题，只单标了她的希望的第一点，而且处理得和原意有出入；至于她对右派分子的晓喻，却略而不提。对于储安平的反党谬论，在徐铸成的决定下，竟然围以花边，显著刊出。充分表明我们新闻编排上的极其鲜明的反动性。这样的处理，就是反对进步的言论，为右派分子效劳。此外，当卢郁文因为说了一些实事求是的公道话而受到反动分子以匿名信进行恐吓的时候，我们没有表示应有的愤慨；当九三学社内部对储安平的反党言论进行驳斥的时候，我们在新闻中却大量报道了右派的意见，而标题也貌似公正地说：“九三学社内部思想交峰”。右派分子孙大雨诬蔑陈其五、章靳以、漆琪生、全增嘏等同志为“反革命分子”，我们刊出了他的发言全文，标题上不予批判；事后由于徐铸成不同意记者写稿，因此也没有反映陈其五、章靳以、漆琪生等同志的批驳孙大雨意见。对于复旦大学笪移今教授的发言被无理阻挠的事件，我们把它看成是“一场小风波”，标题竟以不足道哉的意态出之。在群众中造成没有了是非标准，甚至错的成了对的，黑的成了白的了。
            ×××
    上面所揭露的事实，已无可争辩地证明，文汇报在过去一个短时期内确实犯了不可饶赦的政治错误，成了右派野心分子罗隆基、章伯钧反党、反人民、反社会主义的有力工具。这一令人痛心的事实，追寻根源，是和本报副总编辑兼北京办事处主任浦熙修和右派野心分子罗隆基、章伯钧反动联盟串连一起分不开的。这正像人民日报7月1日的社论所提到：罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报编辑部这一根线，篡夺了文汇报的政治方向。
    社会主义国家的报纸，由于分工不同，它的作用也就不同。但是，站稳工人阶级立场，宣传和贯彻党的政策，维护工人阶级和全国人民的利益，这是社会主义国家任何报纸必须具有的共同之点。
    文汇报是一张以知识分子为对象的报纸。在我国五百多万知识分子中，对社会主义不十分欢迎和抱有敌对情绪的右派，毕竟是少数。广大的知识分子，是爱国主义者，他们拥护社会主义，拥护共产党。在这些知识分子中，有一些人对于在社会主义制度下如何工作，对许多新的问题如何解决，不大清楚；也有些人对于马克思列宁主义，还不大习惯。作为一张以知识分子为对象的报纸，就应该根据这种情况，在党的领导下，站稳工人阶级立场，影响和帮助知识分子，使他们逐渐掌握马克思列宁主义，逐渐树立工人阶级的、共产主义的世界观。这是本报的根本任务。在去年10月复刊之前，在党的指导和帮助之下，这个基本方针是已经确定了的。而且在复刊期间，也在这个正确方针指导之下，做了一些工作。
    但是，在章伯钧——罗隆基反动联盟指使下，通过浦熙修逐步篡改了这个方针，终于在“大放大鸣”期间，使整个报纸沦为右派分子向党猖狂进攻，反社会主义、反人民的工具。
    浦熙修秉承章、罗意旨在文汇报贯彻右派路线
    浦熙修和罗隆基关系的密切是人所共知。当文汇报去年复刊前夕，罗隆基就约了浦熙修同去北戴河。文汇报复刊后，浦熙修在报纸工作中，就贯彻着罗隆基章伯钧的反动观点。浦熙修不是向党靠拢，而事事向罗隆基、章伯钧等右派野心分子请示，布置本报北京办事处的工作。她还经常在北京办事处进行“传达”。现在检查证明，她所“传达”的，不是党中央的指示，而是右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基的指示。这样，就使得北京办事处的编辑和记者，在执行工作的时候，被浦熙修引往错误的道路。有时候，罗隆基还直接对本报北京办事处发号施令，居然狂妄地申斥记者，说他们不该不将某些新闻以专电拍发上海。其活动之猖狂，由此可见。
    浦熙修就利用这种条件，为罗隆基右派小集团服务，排斥进步人士的文章和有关的新闻报道。这就必然使文汇报脱离了正确的方针。她自己从来不去组织进步人士写稿，就是记者想组织这类稿子，她也反对。其中以对邓初民同志的例子最为显著。邓初民在宣传会议期间，在本报发表了一篇“我对毛主席讲话精神的体会”，提出大放大鸣后要大争，这一论点是完全正确的，但浦熙修就骂之为“教条主义”，并且认为不该登这样的文章；徐铸成也这样看，还打长途电话来上海编辑部，说以后这些稿子要“注意些”。在中央统战部座谈会上，储安平发表谬论的同一天，邓初民也在会上发了言，说了一些公道的话，记者打算发专电，浦熙修不同意，却指挥记者将储安平的谬论全文发出。陈垣同志和其他一些民主人士在统战部的发言，也因为不合右派分子的心意，为浦熙修阻止，不许记者发专电。在日常工作中，浦熙修有计划地将记者往右拉。例如，派记者跟着右派小集团分子潘光旦出去“视察”，派记者采写右派小集团分子李景汉、吴景超、潘光旦的“访问记”。记者提出要组织一些进步人士的文章，浦熙修不是多方阻挠就是不予支持，往往以“教条主义”四个字来一笔抹煞。从5月下旬起，编委会曾多次指示北京办事处要组织一些正面说理的文章和新闻，但是，浦熙修拒绝接受编委会的指示，扣压一些应发的专电；相反，却派记者一再采写“北大民主墙”之类带有极大煽动性的报道，和拍发右派分子谬论的新闻专电。人民日报社论“这是为什么？”发表后，编委会为了配合整个反右派斗争，指示北京办事处火速组织反驳右派谬论的稿子，并且提出一些组稿对象。党组书记、副总编辑还亲自打长途电话给浦熙修。但是，浦熙修却阻挠北京办事处记者组织吴晗等同志的文章，而以所谓“以理服人”为幌子，亲自去组织费孝通、楼邦彦写的文章，以便为储安平打掩护。
    浦熙修的这些活动，证明她利用在本报的职权，执行右派分子的路线，把文汇报拖到绝路上去。
    徐铸成事事抗拒党的领导，处处同储安平竞赛谁更右
    在浦熙修进行反党活动的同时，在上海，文汇报社长兼总编辑徐铸成也执行了右派野心分子的路线。他抗拒党的领导，以反对“教条主义”为名来反对马克思主义；以反对“两点论”来抹煞党的成绩；主张在基层点火，并且提出“唱反调”，坚持某些版面的反动编排。
    徐铸成在本报复刊的时候，将两位党员负责同志赶走，作为他的“拆墙经验”。对此，不仅津津乐道，还在上海宣传工作会议上作为发言内容；还写成文章在报纸上刊出。上海宣传会议期间，党发觉了右派分子利用整风运动的机会进行猖狂进攻。文汇报党组举行扩大会议，讨论当前报纸工作，邀请徐铸成参加。在这次会上，已作了正确的决定。但是，徐铸成不接受党的领导，不执行党的决定。在上海宣传工作会议闭幕后，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志亲自和徐铸成谈过，说方针是只放不收，但希望注意歪风。然而，徐铸成却认为上海的做法是“收”，与中央精神“不对头”。他说，在整个方针未明确前，不准备写社论。而且说，我们都是有政治经验的，不能随风倒。在此期间，上海市委宣传部长石西民同志也找他谈过，但缺乏共同语言。本报党组负责同志也几次和他谈，也始终没有效果。徐铸成以所谓“独立思考”——实质上是抗拒党的领导来指导编辑部的工作，把报纸拖上右派的道路。由于报纸走上了反动的道路，编辑部不少同志表示愤慨和不满，一再要求重新明确本报方针，决定当前做法。编委会为此分别在6月3日和5日举行了两次会议，专就方针问题进行讨论。在第一次会上，徐铸成竟然提出如何与储安平主持的光明日报进行“竞赛”的问题，提出“唱反调”的荒谬主张。当时大部分编委指出：基调只有一个，不应该有“反调”；文汇报的传统，是坚持进步知识分子立场，不应放弃这个立场；我们不应该和储安平比赛谁更右，应该从进步立场出发，引导读者向前进。尽管有激烈的争论，而且大多数编委赞成正确的主张，但是，徐铸成不愿意将报纸从右派的道路上转回正路上来。因此，说等第二次编委会再行讨论。在第二次编委会上，徐铸成闭口不谈方针问题，说这个问题要带到“中央”去研究，却提出所谓“分工问题”，将党组书记、副总编辑的工作，挤到只管二版和“社会大学”、“教育生活”去。而在日常工作中，党员负责干部在执行职务的时候，徐铸成又以所谓“以党代政”的帽子，加以打击。这样，党的领导就被取消，党的意图就无法在编辑部贯彻；右派的主张得以横行，错误的思想统治着编辑部。
    在这期间，徐铸成直接干预编辑事务，决定稿子取舍，执行反动方针。例如，储安平的谬论，主编收到专电之后，认为要考虑；但是，徐铸成径行发给编辑，并关照“加框在第一版刊出”；又如“北大民主墙”的报道，浦熙修发来，编辑不同意登，徐铸成要登。邓初民同志的稿子，浦熙修说是“教条”，徐铸成也说是“教条”，还有一篇，他连看也没有看过，就叫编辑注意邓初民的“教条主义”。刊登陈望道、金仲华两位同志在上海宣传会议的发言，徐铸成不满意，一再批评编辑；没有刊登本报记者吕文向党进攻的发言，徐铸成也不满意，也是一再批评编辑部，甚至在编委扩大会议上还提出来。有一篇大学教授写的文章，全文三千多字，只有二三百字谈到知识分子需要改造，其余都是批评党的工作的；徐铸成坚持要将那二三百字删掉，否则就不同意刊登。一位编委根据党中央关于整风运动的指示的精神，写了一篇社论谈和风细雨，徐铸成对于这样的社论表示不同意，在审查的时候竟然扣压下来。编辑做了正面的标题，就被徐铸成一再批评为“两点论——教条”。凡是谈到正面的意见，他就一律称之为“收”，以此否定正面的意见。这些错误的做法和反动的意见，在编辑部造成极大的危害，使文汇报在前一时期成了一张反社会主义的报纸。
    从以上事例可以看出，浦熙修、徐铸成怎样执行章、罗反动联盟的方针，篡改了本报原来正确的方针；也可以看出本报这次犯严重错误的最根本原因。
    不少编辑记者资产阶级思想严重以致为右派野心分子俘虏
    文汇报犯有如此严重的错误，除了上述的根本原因之外，还在于报纸编辑部不少同志有严重的资产阶级思想和严重的资产阶级新闻观点。如果不是这样，浦熙修、徐铸成的谬论就不可能找到市场；如果不是这样，他们的反动言行就早已被揭发；如果不是这样，前些日子和他们的斗争就不会如此软弱无力；编辑部也就不可能被笼罩在黑雾之中。因此，当我们回顾过去所走过的那段歪路的时候，就看见我们中的一些人灵魂中的脏污，感到无限羞惭；对人民负了债，犯了罪，言之十分痛心。
    在本报编辑部中，有许多是从旧社会来的所谓“老报人”。虽然经过思想改造运动，对资产阶级思想和资产阶级新闻观点作了初次批判。但是，并没有改造好，并没有努力钻研马克思主义，改造自己的思想和掌握共产主义世界观。不少人的思想感情，还没有转移到工人阶级方面来。
    本报在去年10月复刊以来，报纸版面上就断断续续地出过不少错误。有些标题片面夸张，以至题文不符，歪曲了新闻内容。例如，印度总统普拉沙德说，他看过印度到中国考察农业的人员的报告书，目前正在考虑根据这个报告书采取措施。而我们的标题却是“印度在农业方面将采取同中国一样的措施”。在电影讨论中，已经出现了某些修正主义的偏向（不仅刊出了如朱煮竹等抹煞成绩的文章，还将赵丹同志等的文章谈到电影工作成绩的部分删去），但是，我们没有深入检查，引为警惕；而在此后组织的几个问题讨论中，往往是反面意见占多数，正面意见占少数，形成一边倒的情况。这些问题，当时只看成个别问题，也没有深予追究，从思想上挖根，进行严肃的批判。到了“鸣放”期间，这种资产阶级思想日见抬头。在徐铸成出国期间，编辑部的错误思想已有所活动；在徐铸成归国以后，由于他的把持操纵，有些错误思想发展到相当严重的程度。
    由于立场不稳、资产阶级思想严重，因此，在编辑、记者以及编委会的许多成员中，对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，是体会不深的；对于“大鸣大放”是思想领域内的阶级斗争——后来更发展成为政治领域内的阶级斗争，是认识不清的。由于资产阶级思想作祟，许多同志混淆了资产阶级民主和社会主义民主的原则区别；混淆了资本主义国家报纸和社会主义国家报纸的原则区别。由此，产生了严重的错误，成了右派野心分子的俘虏，参加到对党进攻的行列之中，给党和人民的事业造成重大的损失。
      “草木篇”是毒草，已有正确的结论。但是，我们的记者范琰，却要以所谓“客观”的态度访问流沙河。他的计划，竟然被编委所批准；写出站在流沙河立场、妄指别人“侵犯人身自由”的通讯，经过编委同志审查，也决定刊用。农业部部长助理左叶同志，对记者的态度有缺点。本报不仅为此从北京发来专电，写了社论；以后还连续发表了不少缺乏与人为善态度的杂文（包括“群言堂”中的短文），对他集中攻击；后来，还在上海举行记者座谈会，对许多人和许多单位提出“批评”，实质上就是要求资产阶级的“新闻自由”。记者吕文更抱着与党敌对的情绪在上海宣传会议上作了反动的发言。
    在整风运动期间，编委会决定对高教、教育、文化、科学、卫生等部门多进行报道。这个决定的本身并没有错。但是，在执行的过程中，就鲜花毒草不分，甚至变成只要毒草，不要鲜花。许多记者在新闻报道中，专拣“尖锐意见”，少写甚至不写正面意见；以北京办事处而论，5月份发过五十八条专电，其中97％（即五十六条）是反面意见或突出了反面的意见。其他各地情况，也有相类似之处。编辑在处理版面、拟标题的时候，抓住片言只字，孤立起来做出耸人听闻的标题。这些标题，除前文已经提到的之外，还有：“规划不定、方向不明、设计工作存在严重浪费”，“漫画消沉是清规戒律之过”，“担心曲艺艺术进棺材”，“成都教育界高墙仍在”，“上海作协不务正业像个衙门”，“电影局宗派主义严重”，“教育部教条主义为患大矣”，“上海科学教育电影制片厂领导偏听偏信缺乏民主空气，厂中流传四句话：知而不言，言而不尽，言者有罪，闻者不戒”，“知识分子头上泼了许多冷水”等等反党的恶毒标题。
    编辑部还在文化、科学、教育、卫生等部门，以“揭盖子”为名，放了不少的火。在上海，在人民艺术剧院、京剧院等单位起了“放火”的作用。还打电报给各地记者和特约记者，要他们组织教师开座谈会，对教育部提意见。并且以“教育生活”版的大部分篇幅，登中小教师的“鸣放”意见，做了锌版标题“让中小学教师也来说话！”以煽起教师的情绪。在5月27日的“教育生活”版复读者的信中，甚至还极端错误地说：“特别是中小城镇和农村，很多还没有鸣起来，就更应该大力给予支持和鼓励，让他们把对领导上的各种意见都提出来。”这种“唯恐天下不乱”的思想，发展到了极其严重的程度。
    由于混淆了资产阶级民主和社会主义民主的原则区别，丧失了工人阶级的立场，结果就倒向了资产阶级右派野心分子的一边。在标题中，把向党进攻的谭惕吾之流的谬论予以肯定，还在九三学社新闻的标题中，说什么“反党的帽子很沉重、不能随便加给人的”，“发言的人难免有过火处、相信党中央是有雅量的”，“除弊端可下猛药、不刺痛一点不行”。对于正面的意见，往往不标题，作了标题也只是含糊其词；有些正面的发言——如周建人谈到拥护党的主张的，竟然予以删节，而对章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平之流的反党、反社会主义言论，却以显著地位刊登。
    从总的方面看，编辑部在这一时期，是站到右派野心分子一边，向党和工人阶级进攻，以对敌人的手段来对党以及党的事业，这是为亲者所痛，为仇者所快的。
    通过初步检查，我们认识到只有认真划清和右派分子的关系，坚决起来和右派分子作斗争；认真接受党的领导，站稳工人阶级立场，并且加强本报编辑部的思想改造，才能把报纸办好。
    报纸编辑部正在进行学习，从这次错误中吸取教训。我们感谢党的教导，一定要继续深入进行检查。我们恳切希望广大读者多予帮助，普遍揭发我们的错误。
