    This newspaper reports that the Beijing Art Normal College's Democratic League branch rectification group recently held four consecutive meetings, exposing and criticizing Liu Xue'an, the vice-chairman of the college's preparatory committee (in charge of academic affairs as vice-president) and chairman of the Democratic League branch, for his anti-Party, anti-socialist behavior and his ugly trick of so-called "not engaging in politics, only engaging in music." Faculty members of the college were also invited to attend.

    Since the start of the rectification movement, Liu Xue'an has adopted double-dealing tactics and made many remarks attacking the leadership of the Party. Wu Rangbin, a member of the League and a lecturer in the Fine Arts Department, pointed out: Liu Xue'an said at a forum held by the Chinese Musicians Association that "Looking at the leadership of the Musicians Association, there are three chairmen and four secretaries-general. If Ma Sicong is removed, it will be a completely Party member-led organization." How is this different from Chu Anping's "Party-dominated world" theory? Liu Xue'an's speech was on May 23, ten days earlier than Chu Anping's "Party-dominated world." Wu Rangbin said that Liu Xue'an also said very viciously in his speech at the Musicians Association that "The Musicians Association's structure is too political and not academic enough." We cannot help but ask: What is wrong with being more political? Is it better to separate art from politics?

    Liu Xue'an's anti-Party words and deeds appeared in a subtle way. Wu Rangbin revealed that Liu Xue'an used the excuse that "Not many old professors in our school are joining the Party, so is it feasible to implement the Party committee responsibility system in our school?" to raise doubts about the Party's leadership. After the rectification, Liu Xue'an used the name of the Democratic League to convene a meeting to discuss the academic system, inviting department directors from the Ministry of Education, the Party branch, the academic affairs section chief, teachers from various groups, and even middle school teachers to participate. At the meeting, he made a lot of remarks, trying to show that he could lead teaching, while the Party was incapable of doing anything in teaching and should listen to him.

    Gao Guanhua, a lecturer in the Fine Arts Department and secretary of the Democratic League branch, revealed the process of Liu Xue'an revising the draft declaration of the branch meeting, which requested the Democratic League Central Committee to thoroughly investigate Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others for their reactionary remarks and suggested a re-election. He said that Liu Xue'an not only deleted the sections in the declaration that talked about maintaining the glorious tradition of the Democratic League, the Communist Party's achievements in leading 600 million people for eight years, and the Zhang-Luo alliance's attempt to use the Party's rectification opportunity to create a major chaos, but also deleted all the "reactionary" words in the draft, saying, "People outside the League can say they are reactionary, but how can League members say that?" Is there a different position inside and outside the League in the anti-Rightist struggle?

    Gao Guanhua also revealed Liu Xue'an's conspiracy to develop the organization to achieve his personal political ambitions. Liu Xue'an attempted to develop the other two of the four leaders in the college, apart from himself and another Party member in charge, into League members, creating a three-to-one situation, so that he, as the chairman of the Democratic League branch, could control the power of the whole school. Lao Zhicheng, the director of the college's preparatory committee, also revealed that Liu Xue'an had someone send him a form without giving him enough time to consider it, and urged him to fill it out during his busy time before going abroad, even filling in some parts for him. Now it seems that this eagerness was only to achieve Liu Xue'an's personal political goals.

    Liu Xue'an's double-dealing tactics were also quite clever. Bo Yibin, a member of the League and a professor in the Music Department, revealed Liu Xue'an's speech at the Municipal Committee of the Democratic League on the evening of June 11, encouraging and supporting Rightist elements to continue releasing poison, and saying things like "Don't put pressure on Rightist elements" and "I very much agree with Chen Xingui's attitude" to exonerate Rightist elements. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, Liu Xue'an quickly submitted an article to the Party newspaper in the name of the chairman of the Democratic League branch to cover up his Rightist words and deeds. Li Ruinian, the director of the Fine Arts Department, and Bu Yu Hua, an associate professor in the Music Department, both pointed out that Liu Xue'an's "Fish Monster's Chorus," published in the People's Daily on June 28, seemed to be criticizing Rightists, but was actually a double-dealing tactic to muddle through.

    At the rectification meeting convened by the Party in Beijing Art Normal College, Liu Xue'an repeatedly said that he had the position but no power. In reality, he not only had the position and power, but also overstepped his authority. Hong Dalin, the deputy director of the Music Department, pointed out that during the time when the whole school arranged to study "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," Liu Xue'an, as the deputy director, discussed other issues, which could hardly be described as having the position but no power. Geng Shenglian, the secretary of the Music Department, also revealed that Liu Xue'an transferred cadres out of the department without going through the department. Wu Rangbin said that Liu Xue'an had formally proposed that personnel work should be reported to the college and opposed the personnel system being controlled by the Party. Lin Zhonglin, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, further revealed that Liu Xue'an not only wanted to control the leadership of Beijing Art Normal College, but also said that the Ministry of Education did not understand the business of art education, and suggested the establishment of a National Art Education Committee, and even said: "I will be reformed in the rectification movement, so that China's art education can take a step forward," which shows how big his ambition was to control the national art education.

    Liu Xue'an has always appeared as a progressive face, an expert, and even wrote on the big-character posters in Beijing Art Normal College that he was "not engaged in politics, but engaged in music." Shen Siyan, a professor in the Music Department, said: Liu Xue'an claimed to be engaged in professional work, but how come he didn't teach any classes for a year? Shen Weisong, a member of the League and a lecturer in the Music Department, revealed that since Liu Xue'an shamelessly brought out a set of his so-called "glorious history," let us take a look at what kind of music he was engaged in: Before liberation, Liu Xue'an had joined the Kuomintang twice. After the "April 12th" incident in 1927, people with integrity could see which path to take under the White Terror, but Liu Xue'an still joined the Kuomintang. In Liu Xue'an's confession, he said that he was blacklisted and almost lost his life for co-writing the "Qu Yuan" interlude with Guo Moruo. In fact, he wrote more reactionary songs. Such as: Drafted Soldier Enlistment Song, Nation First Song, War Song, Air Force Song, Navy Song, and music for various ceremonies of the Kuomintang. His songs that further anesthetized the people was the well-known "When Will You Return." After his fake Air Force Song won the first prize, he was appreciated and valued by Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and other Kuomintang navy and air force commanders. He worked as a music instructor at the fake Air Force School, and Gui Yongqing introduced him to the Third Department of the Political Department of the Fake Military Commission as a design committee member, with the rank of major general; he also wrote a "Family Song" for Yang Sen, the biggest warlord in Sichuan, who was known to everyone as a bully oppressing the people. After the national liberation, Liu Xue'an pretended to be progressive, and he shamelessly took the piano piece "Southern Goose," which was performed in Chongqing as early as 1945, slightly modified it, and from 1953, repeatedly impersonated it as a new work, published or performed it.

    The person in charge of the Democratic League rectification group in Beijing Art Normal College and the faculty and staff of the school firmly stated that if Liu Xue'an does not thoroughly confess his reactionary words and deeds, the struggle against him will never stop.

### 刘雪庵“不搞政治，只搞音乐”的丑恶把戏

    刘雪庵“不搞政治，只搞音乐”的丑恶把戏
    本报讯　北京艺术师范学院民盟支部整风小组近日来连续召开了四次会议，揭发和批判该院筹备委员会副主任（执行教学副院长职务）、民盟支部主任委员刘雪庵的反党反社会主义和所谓“不搞政治，只搞音乐”的丑恶把戏。该院教职员也应邀出席。
    刘雪庵自整风运动开始以后，采取了两面派的手法，发表了不少攻击党的领导的言论。盟员、美术系讲师吴让宾指出：刘雪庵在中国音乐家协会召开的座谈会上说“以音协的领导来看，有三个主席、四个秘书长，如果把马思聪去掉，那就成了清一色的党员领导。”这和储安平的“党天下”论调又有什么两样呢？刘雪庵的发言是在5月23日，比储安平的“党天下”还要早十天。吴让宾说，刘雪庵在音协的发言中还十分恶毒地说“音协机构，政治性太强，学术性太差”，我们不禁要问：政治性强了有什么不好？难道使艺术脱离政治才好吗？
    刘雪庵的反党言行，是以若隐若现的手法出现的。吴让宾揭发刘雪庵借口“本校老教授入党的不多，在本校实行党委负责制是否有条件”来引起大家对党的领导发生疑问。整风以后，刘雪庵就用盟的名义召开讨论学制的会议，从教育部的司长、党总支、教务科长、各组先生一直到中学教师都请来参加；在会上大发言论，企图表现他能领导教学，而党在教学上无能为力，要党听他的话。
    美术系讲师、民盟支部秘书高冠华揭发了刘雪庵修改支部大会要求民盟中央彻查章伯钧、罗隆基等的反动言行，并建议进行改选的宣言稿的经过。他说，刘雪庵不但将宣言稿中讲到要保持民盟的光荣传统、八年来共产党领导六亿人民的功绩、和章罗联盟想利用党整风的机会来一次大混乱等段删掉，并把稿中的“反动”字眼全都删掉了，而且在删掉时还说：“盟外的人可以说他们反动，盟员怎么能说呢？”难道在反右派斗争中，盟内盟外还有两个不同的立场吗？
    高冠华还揭露了刘雪庵发展组织来达到个人政治野心的阴谋。刘雪庵企图在该院四位领导人中，除他自己和另一位党员负责人外，发展其他二位成为盟员，造成三对一的局势，作为民盟支部主任委员的他便能掌握全校的大权了。该院筹备委员会主任老志诚也揭发了刘雪庵没有让他有充分考虑的时间就叫人送了表来，并且在他出国前的繁忙中来催促他填好，甚至还代他填了一些。现在看来，这种积极不过是为了达到刘雪庵个人的政治目的。
    刘雪庵的两面派手法也是颇为高明的。盟员、音乐系教授薄一彬揭发了刘雪庵6月11日晚在民盟市委会上鼓励和支持右派分子继续放毒的发言，还说什么“不要使右派分子感到压力”和“我很赞成陈新桂的态度”等等来为右派分子开脱。当反右派斗争展开以后，刘雪庵就赶快用民盟支部主任委员的名义向党报投稿，来掩饰他的右派言行。美术系主任李瑞年和音乐系副教授卜瑜华都指出刘雪庵发表在人民日报6月28日的那篇“鱼妖的重唱曲”，好像是批判右派，其实是想蒙混过关的两面手法。
    在北京艺术师范学院党召开的整风会议上，刘雪庵口口声声说他有职无权，实际上他不仅是有职有权，而且越职越权。音乐系副主任洪达琳指出，在全校布置了学“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”的时间里，刘雪庵却以副主任的身份来讨论另外的问题，这难道是有职无权吗？音乐系秘书耿生廉也揭发刘雪庵不通过系里，就独自将干部调出系外工作。吴让宾说：刘雪庵曾正式提出，要求人事工作要向院部汇报，反对人事制度掌握在党的手里。团委书记林中霖更揭露刘雪庵不仅想掌握北京艺术师范学院的领导权，还说教育部不懂艺术教育的业务，曾建议成立全国艺术教育委员会，甚至还说：“我在整风运动中得到改造，好让中国的艺术教育事业跨前一步”，可见他要达到个人掌握全国艺术教育事业的野心有多大了。
    刘雪庵一向以进步的面孔、专家的身份出现，还在北京艺术师范学院的大字报上写着，他“不是搞政治，是搞音乐”的。音乐系教授沈思岩说：刘雪庵既是搞业务的，怎么来了一年也不开课呢？盟员、音乐系讲师沈蔚颂揭发说，刘雪庵既然厚颜无耻的搬出一套自己所谓的“光荣历史”，就让我们来看看他搞的是什么音乐罢：刘雪庵解放前，曾经两次加入国民党，1927年“四、一二”以后，在白色恐怖下，有血气的人都看清了应该走那条路，而刘雪庵却还加入国民党。在刘雪庵的交代中，他说为了和郭沫若合写“屈原”插曲，曾被列入黑名单，几乎性命难保。其实，他写的更多是反动歌曲。如：壮丁入伍歌、民族至上歌、战歌、空军之歌、海军之歌、以及国民党多种典礼的乐曲。他那更麻醉人民的歌曲，就是众人皆知的“何日君再来”。他作的伪空军之歌获得了头奖以后，于是被桂永清、周致柔等国民党海军、空军司令所赏识和器重。他作过伪空军学校的音乐教官，他到伪军委会政治部三厅担任设计委员是桂永清介绍的，有少将的军衔；他还替四川最大的军阀、人人皆知的欺压人民的恶霸杨森作过一首“家歌”。全国解放后，刘雪庵装出了一付进步面孔，他无耻地将1945年就在重庆演出过的钢琴曲“南来雁”，略加修改后从1953年起，几次冒充新作品、发表或演出。
    北京艺术师范学院民盟整风小组的负责人和该校教职员坚决地表示，如果刘雪庵不彻底交代反动言行，对他的斗争决不罢休。
