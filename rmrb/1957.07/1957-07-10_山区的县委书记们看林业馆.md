County Party Secretaries from Mountainous Areas Visit the Forestry Pavilion  Liu Jie

“This time we’ve discovered the secrets of the forest!” “This time we deeply realized the importance of forestry production!” This is the reaction of many county party secretaries and rural workers from mountainous areas after visiting the Forestry Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition.

Since the opening of the exhibition, the Forestry Pavilion has received more than a thousand county party secretaries from mountainous (including semi-mountainous) areas across the country. They are the most serious and most valued group of visitors among the more than two million visitors to the pavilion. In addition to visiting, these county party secretaries from mountainous areas also listened to a report on forestry work from the person in charge of the Ministry of Forestry, were invited to hold discussions with forestry experts, and watched films about forestry. They all said in unison that this visit was really fruitful!

When the county party secretaries learned specifically from the Forestry Pavilion about the extreme scarcity and uneven distribution of forest resources in our country, and learned that the output of timber and forestry products was very disproportionate to the huge needs of national construction and people's lives, they felt surprised and anxious. A county party secretary from a forest area said with emotion: "In the past, I only saw that there were many forests in our county, and I thought that forest resources were not a problem. Who knew that from a national perspective, there were too few forests!" Some people, after seeing artificial wool made from wood processing that was softer and whiter than sheep's wool, artificial silk that was more beautiful than natural silk, and compressed board and laminated wooden pipes that were as durable as steel, praised them endlessly. Some county party secretaries from mountainous areas in Jiangsu Province said: If we develop forestry on a large scale and use more wood to make artificial fibers, it will be easier to solve the contradiction between cotton and grain competing for land.

Afforestation is a good thing, which no one will deny; however, some people believe that "the time from planting trees to obtaining benefits is too long, and it is like trying to quench thirst with distant water." However, this is not always the case. During the forestry work experience exchange at the Forestry Pavilion, county party secretaries from mountainous areas introduced many examples of forestry production that yielded benefits quickly. For example, farmers in mountainous areas of southern provinces plant tung trees while planting Chinese fir. They intercrop miscellaneous grains on the forest land for the first three years, and starting from the fourth year, the tung trees blossom and bear fruit; when the Chinese fir trees grow up, the tung trees age, but at this time the Chinese fir can be thinned. The Hongyuan Township First Agricultural and Forestry Production Cooperative in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, adopted a method of mixed farming and forestry, and can harvest 360 dan of corn, 1,000 dan of tung oil, and 2,000 Chinese fir trees every year. These projects have become the main income of the cooperative. Visitors from mountainous areas also exchanged experiences in cultivating fast-growing tree species. Everyone believed that this method could also combine the immediate and long-term interests of the masses in forestry production. Xia County in Shanxi Province has achieved good results by planting fast-growing tree species that the masses love, such as elm, ailanthus, and black locust. What particularly interested everyone was the populus, because it grows fast, is easy to propagate, does not deplete the soil, and has good material. If a dense planting method is adopted, it can be thinned for rafters after five years.

Through this visit and exchange of experiences, county party secretaries from mountainous areas have more deeply realized the harm of destroying forest resources and neglecting forestry production. Visitors from Guangdong Province cited the following example: There are 380 cooperatives in Guangning County, of which 300 are mainly engaged in forestry. However, 80 cooperatives have already experienced a decline in income for their members due to the trees being cut down; if blind logging continues, another 80 to 100 cooperatives will reduce their income in another three to five years. In Sanhe Township, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, a large amount of logging has led to the inability to conserve water and soil, causing the riverbed to rise by more than three feet. Last year, two floods destroyed 1,390 mu of paddy and dry land and 139 houses. However, in places where forestry production is valued, the situation is different. The county party secretary of Wushan County in Gansu Province introduced that in recent years, the county has afforested and closed mountains for afforestation covering an area of ​​280,000 mu. In 1954, there was a major drought, and farmers near the forest area successfully survived the disaster by relying on mountain forests to develop sideline production. The farmers in this county have therefore gained an experience: "In good times, people raise trees, and in bad times, trees support people." Since then, the enthusiasm of farmers to cultivate forests has been even higher. Now, in forested areas, forestry and sideline income account for 38% of farmers' total income. In Mahe Township, this county, because of the forest, farmers not only have firewood for themselves, but also earn 15 to 30 yuan per household from selling firewood. At the same time, the forest has also increased water sources, and the number of water mills in the township has increased from three to sixteen. Due to irrigation through canals along the river, grain production has also doubled. Visitors also talked about the typical experiences of Yangjingdi Township in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and Daquanshan Township in Yanggao County in cultivating forests and conserving water and soil. All these examples have made visitors more convinced of the importance of forests in preventing natural disasters, stabilizing agricultural production, and promoting the mountainous economy.

This visit not only improved everyone's understanding, but also enhanced their confidence in leading the masses to build mountainous areas.

    山区的县委书记们看林业馆  刘杰
    “这回可发现了森林的秘密！”“这回才深切地认识到了林业生产的重要性！”这是山区的许多中共县委书记和农村工作人员参观过全国农业展览会林业馆以后的反应。
    自从展览会开幕以来，林业馆先后接待了来自全国山区（包括半山区）的一千多个县委书记，他们是这个馆的二百多万观众中间参观得最认真、同时也最受重视的一部分参观者。这些山区县委书记们除了参观以外，还听取了林业部负责人关于林业工作的报告，应邀同林业专家们举行了座谈，看了关于林业的电影。他们异口同声地说，这一次参观收获真不小！
    当县委书记们从林业馆里具体地了解到我国森林资源极端稀少而又分布不匀的情况，了解到木材和林业产品产量同国家建设和人民生活的巨大需要很不相称的时候，他们感到又惊讶又着急。一个林区的县委书记感慨地说：“过去只看到我们县里林子不少，就以为森林资源不成问题，哪知道从全国来看，森林太少了！”有些人看到用木材加工制成的比羊毛还柔还白的人造毛，比天然丝还漂亮的人造丝，像钢铁一样耐用的压缩板和层板木管，赞叹不已。江苏省有些山区县委书记说：如果我们大量发展林业，用更多的木材制人造纤维，就更容易解决棉花同粮食争地的矛盾了。
    造林是好事，这是没有人会否认的；但是有些人却认为，“从栽树到收益的时间太长，远水解不了近渴。”可是，事实并不全是这样，这次前来参观林业馆的山区县委书记们在林业工作经验交流中，就介绍了许多林业生产很快得利早的实例。比如南方各省的山区农民在栽杉木的同时点种油桐，头三年在林地上混种杂粮，第四年起，油桐就开花结果；杉木长大以后油桐衰老，但这时杉木就可以间伐了。江西省婺源县洪源乡第一农林生产合作社采用农林混作方法，每年可收玉米三百六十担，油桐一千担，每年可伐杉木二千根，这些项目已成为这个社的主要收入。来自山区的参观者还交流了培育速生树种的经验，大家认为这个办法也可以在林业生产上把群众眼前利益同长远利益结合起来。山西省夏县栽植群众喜爱的榆树、臭椿、洋槐等速生树种，收效很好。特别使大家感兴趣的是钻天杨，因为它生长快，容易繁殖，不憩地，材质也好，如果采取密植办法，五年之后就可以间伐椽材。
    经过这次参观和交流经验，山区县委书记们更加深刻地体会到破坏森林资源、忽视林业生产的危害性。广东省的参观者就举出这样的例子：广宁县有三百八十个合作社，其中以经营林业为主的有三百个。但是现在已经有八十个社因为林木砍光，社员收入下降；如果继续盲目砍伐林木，再过三、五年，还会有八十——一百个社减少收入。浙江省奉化县三石乡由于大量砍伐林木，水土不能保持，引起河床上升三尺多高，去年两次洪水就冲毁水旱田一千三百九十亩、房屋一百三十九间。但是，在重视林业生产的地方，却是另外一种情况。甘肃省武山县委书记介绍，几年来这个县造林、封山育林的面积达到二十八万亩，1954年发生大旱灾，林区附近的农民由于依靠山林开展副业生产，胜利度过了灾荒。这个县的农民因此获得了一条经验：“无灾人养树，有灾树养人”。从那以后，农民培育森林的积极性更高了。现在，在成林地区，林业和副业收入已占农民总收入的38％。这个县的马河乡因为有了森林，农民不但自己有柴烧，而且每户能收入卖柴钱十五——三十元。同时，森林使水源也增大了，全乡的水磨由三盘增加到十六盘。由于沿河开渠灌溉，粮食产量也增加一倍左右。参观者还谈到了山西省平顺县羊井底乡和阳高县大泉山乡培育森林、保持水土的典型经验。所有这些事例，使参观者更加信服地认识到森林对于防御自然灾害、稳定农业生产和繁荣山区经济的重要作用。
    这次参观不但使大家提高了认识，而且增强了领导群众建设山区的信心。
