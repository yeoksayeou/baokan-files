Xinhua News Agency, 30th: According to a United Press International dispatch from Damascus on the 29th, the Egyptian and Syrian Joint Command studied the tense situation on the Syrian-Israeli border and decided on the measures necessary to cope with any possible events on the border.

Recently, Israeli troops have repeatedly fired on the Syrian side. Lebanese newspapers report that Israeli troops have massed in the Syrian-Israeli border area.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th: The political editor of "Al Shaab" published an article on June 29th stating that American imperialism is conspiring to overthrow Syria's national government. The article said that this conspiracy is being carried out through the Amman-Beirut-Baghdad axis, and separating Syria from Egypt is part of this conspiracy.

The article pointed out that the conspirators are trying to smuggle arms into Syria from Amman and Beirut in order to launch a coup in the future. Those executing the American conspiracy are the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, Jordan, and Iraq; pro-Western Arab leaders like Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Rifai; and some members of the Syrian People's Party. The latter are receiving military training in Jordan and Lebanon and are engaged in activities directed by the American military attaches stationed in Baghdad, Amman, and Beirut.

The article pointed out that the visit of the head of American naval intelligence to Damascus was actually to plot the conspiracy with Develin, a spy expert at the American embassy in Damascus.

    文章指出，阴谋策动者正在努力从安曼和贝鲁特向叙利亚私运军火，以便将来发动政变。执行美国阴谋的是叙利亚、约旦和伊拉克的穆斯林兄弟会的领袖们，像约旦副首相里法伊之流的亲西方的阿拉伯领袖们，以及叙利亚人民党的一些党员们，后面这些人正在约旦和黎巴嫩受着军事训练，并且在从事由驻巴格达、安曼和贝鲁特的美国武官所指挥的活动。
