I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of other national leaders.

Since the founding of the country, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have achieved a series of great accomplishments. All patriotic people, seeing such great development and changes in the motherland, feel unspeakable excitement and joy. Especially for someone of my age, who spent most of their life in old China, having suffered through hardships and vicissitudes, and having personally witnessed how many people with lofty ideals since the Xinhai Revolution sacrificed their lives and shed their blood for China's independence and prosperity, wave upon wave, one truly feels that today is hard-earned. Thinking about the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future, we all realize that being a citizen of New China under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government is the greatest glory and the greatest happiness.

However, a handful of right-wing elements, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Long Yun, and Huang Shaohong, actually want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and oppose socialism, trying to drag our country from the socialist road back into the capitalist quagmire, trying to drag the people of the whole country from the position of masters of the country back to a state of being oppressed and enslaved. This is absolutely intolerable for the liberated Chinese people. At this meeting, many representatives have relentlessly exposed and severely criticized the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements, which precisely reflects the righteous indignation of the broad masses of the people. I am a representative of the people of Gansu, and I should come out and speak. I want to use the facts of Gansu to expose the slanders of the right-wing elements who obliterate the achievements since the founding of the country, especially the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and let everyone see to what extent the right-wing elements have distorted and slandered reality.

Liberation-era Gansu - Natural and Man-made Disasters, People Living in Misery

The pre-liberation Gansu can be described in eight characters: "Natural and man-made disasters, people living in misery." Especially during the twenty-odd years of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu were dragged to the brink of despair. At that time, production was destroyed, the countryside was bankrupt, and people were poorly clothed and fed. When disasters struck, they were even more helpless. In the great drought of 1929, in Lanzhou alone, more than 10,000 disaster victims starved to death in the streets, and the selling of children was everywhere. The reactionary rulers' oppression and exploitation of the people of Gansu truly reached the point of extracting marrow from the bones. They also implemented a cruel policy of national oppression, trying to provoke relations between and within ethnic groups, creating disputes, causing serious losses to the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups. It was precisely due to the reactionary rule that Gansu's economy and culture were in an extremely backward state. By the time of liberation in 1949, the province had only thirty-odd dilapidated small factories and mines, with no more than 7,000 employees, except for the slightly larger-scale Yumen Oil Mine. The output value of modern industry accounted for only 2.15 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Grain production was only more than 4.3 billion jin. The only few dozen kilometers of the Baotou-Tianshui Railway were a notorious "dead end." Most counties had no access to cars or telephones. There were less than 300,000 primary school students and only more than 1,000 university students in the entire province. The long-term reactionary rule left the people of Gansu with only a history of blood and tears.

Post-Liberation Gansu - Clearing the Clouds and Seeing the Sky, Living and Working in Peace

After liberation, the people of Gansu cleared the clouds and saw the blue sky. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, great achievements have been made in all aspects. Especially 1956 was a year of great change and great development. The achievements of this year greatly exceeded those of the six years from 1949 to 1955. By the end of 1956, Gansu had basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and socialist construction had also achieved unprecedented results. The province already had more than 300 production factories and mines, and more than 60 factories and mines were under construction, including more than a dozen large-scale industries such as oil refineries, petroleum machinery factories, and thermal power plants. The number of employees increased to 300,000, and the proportion of modern industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value had risen to 15.86 percent. Grain production reached 10.9 billion jin. It has changed from a historically grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province. Ninety percent of agricultural cooperatives increased production, and 85 percent of cooperative members increased their income. A large amount of dry land has been turned into irrigated land. In 1956 alone, the increase in irrigated land reached 4.36 million mu, exceeding the total area of irrigated land built in the six years after liberation, equivalent to more than half of the total area of irrigated land in the thousands of years before liberation. In the driest areas, more than 100 townships, due to the increase in irrigated land, have been able to escape the threat of general drought. More than 1,500 kilometers of new railways have been built, and more than 800 kilometers have been officially opened to traffic. The length of highways reached more than 14,000 kilometers, with every county accessible by car and every district having telephones. Even the Yinping Ancient Road (Wen County), which has been historically famous for its ruggedness, was opened to traffic by highway in 1956. The number of primary school students in the province increased to more than 1.16 million, and the number of university students increased to more than 6,000. There were more than 3,000 primary schools collectively run by the masses, with more than 160,000 students. The social order in the province was unprecedentedly stable, the people lived and worked in peace and contentment, and their lives had been significantly improved. The purchasing power of farmers increased from an average of 6 yuan per person in 1950 to 45 yuan. The sales volume of cotton cloth in the province increased from more than 950,000 bolts in 1950 to more than 4.3 million bolts. People of all ethnic groups have formed a new relationship of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation, which is being strengthened day by day on the basis of jointly building socialism. Now, the people of the province are working hard with unparalleled enthusiasm to build Gansu into a new socialist industrial base of the motherland. The long-cherished ideals of the people of Gansu are gradually being realized.

From the comparison of the situation in Gansu before and after liberation, and from the development and changes in Gansu in the past eight years, especially since 1956, what problem does this illustrate? It vividly shows that the leadership of the Communist Party is correct, the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system are superior, and the achievements of the past eight years are great. It powerfully proves the complete bankruptcy of the right-wing arguments.

We do not conceal the shortcomings and errors in our work

While affirming the achievements, we do not deny the shortcomings and errors that have occurred in the work of the past eight years, nor do we relax the necessary efforts to correct these shortcomings and errors. The Communist Party and the People's Government never conceal their shortcomings and errors. Although these shortcomings and errors are individual, and some of them are indeed difficult to avoid or completely avoid, we will never ignore them. As soon as we discover them, we will find ways to correct them and learn lessons from them. In particular, the construction undertakings in the Gansu area are developing rapidly, but the original foundation is very poor, and our experience is very insufficient. We need to pay attention at all times, strive to correctly understand the objective reality, correctly distinguish between right and wrong, and try to make as few mistakes as possible, not repeat past mistakes, and not turn small mistakes into big mistakes. However, in any case, our shortcomings and errors are ultimately secondary compared with our achievements, and they are by no means insurmountable. The right-wing elements deliberately exaggerate the shortcomings, reverse black and white, and say that our work is a "complete mess," which is actually completely disregarding the labor achievements of the broad masses of the people and cadres, and trying to attack the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, attempting to undermine our socialist cause, and then negate the leadership of the Communist Party, negate the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, in order to pave the way for capitalism. Isn't this obvious enough?

Of course, different positions and different ideological feelings will inevitably lead to different views on what is good and what is "bad." Take the socialist revolution as an example. Changing the thousands-year-old private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership is, in the eyes of the broad masses of the people, digging out the root of poverty and a great thing; but in the eyes of the right-wing elements, it is digging out the root of their lives and a terrible thing. It is only natural that they feel particularly distressed. The right-wing elements always refuse to admit that there is a problem with their position, but in fact their reactionary class instinct has long exposed their true colors to the people.

Right-wing elements neither understand the people nor themselves

Like all arrogant careerists, right-wing elements have no self-awareness. They neither understand the people nor themselves. They overestimate themselves and underestimate the people, thinking that the people can be fooled. They appear in the guise of speaking for the people, setting fires everywhere, thinking that in this way, the people will follow them and the Communist Party will collapse. Chu Anping of Beijing, under the orders of the Zhang-Luo alliance, traveled thousands of miles to send reporters to Lanzhou to start fires and support the right-wing elements in Gansu. Their greed for profit can be said to have reached its extreme. And what was the result? The fire was started, but it was not as wonderful as the right-wing elements thought. What was burning was the anger of the people across the country against the right-wing elements. Those who play with fire will burn themselves. This should be an extremely pungent lesson for the right-wing elements. Now, the right-wing elements have fallen into isolation. If they do not want to cut themselves off from the people, they must immediately turn over a new leaf, make a thorough confession to the people, and seek the lenient treatment of the people, otherwise, it will be too late to regret it.

The struggle against the right-wing elements is a class struggle in politics and ideology, and a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. We cannot be soft on the right-wing elements. Being soft on the right-wing elements is being unkind to the people. We must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and together with the people of the whole country, carry the struggle against the right-wing elements through to the end, and temper and improve ourselves in the struggle. I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our socialist cause must be victorious, and it will certainly be victorious.

### 请看甘肃省的事实  邓宝珊的发言

专栏：

    请看甘肃省的事实
    邓宝珊的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其他各位国家领导同志的报告。
    开国以来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下取得了一系列的伟大成就。一切爱国的人们，看到祖国这样伟大的发展和变化，真有说不出的兴奋和愉快，尤其是我这样年龄的人，在旧中国渡过了大半生，可以说是饱经忧患，历尽沧桑，亲眼看到辛亥革命以来，多少仁人志士，为了中国的独立和富强，抛头颅，洒热血，前仆后继，更是感到今天的来之不易。想想过去，看看现在，瞻望将来，我们都会体会到：在共产党和人民政府领导下做一个新中国的人民，真是最大的光荣，最大的幸福。
    但是，一小撮右派分子，如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、龙云、黄绍竑之流，竟然要取消共产党的领导，推翻人民民主专政，反对社会主义，想把我们国家从社会主义的道路上拖回到资本主义的泥坑里去，想把全国人民从国家主人翁的地位拖回到被压迫、被奴役的境地。这是解放了的中国人民断乎不能容忍的。这次会上，许多代表对右派分子的反动言行进行了无情的揭发和严正的批判，正是反映了广大人民的正义愤慨。我是甘肃人民的代表，我应当出来说话。我要用甘肃的事实，来揭穿右派分子抹煞开国以来的成就，特别是抹煞社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就的谰言，让大家看看，右派分子对现实的歪曲污蔑，已经到了怎样的地步。
    解放前的甘肃——天灾人祸，民不聊生
    解放前的甘肃，可以用八个字来形容：“天灾人祸，民不聊生”。特别是在蒋介石反动统治的二十多年期间，甘肃各民族人民被拖到了绝境。那时候，生产破坏，农村破产，人民衣不蔽体，食不果腹。遇到灾荒，更是束手无策。一九二九年的大旱，单是兰州一地，灾民饿死街头的就在万人以上，出卖儿女的到处皆是。反动统治者对于甘肃人民的压迫和剥削，真是到了敲骨吸髓的程度。他们还实行残酷的民族压迫政策，竭力挑拨民族之间和民族内部的关系，制造纠纷，使各族人民的生命财产遭受严重的损失。正是由于反动统治的结果，甘肃的经济文化处于极端落后状态。到一九四九年解放的时候，全省除了玉门油矿略具规模以外，只有三十几个破破烂烂的小厂矿，职工不过七千人。现代工业的产值，在工农业总产值中，只占百分之二点一五。粮食产量，只有四十三亿多斤。境内仅有的几十公里宝天铁路，还是有名的“盲肠”。大部分县不通汽车，不通电话。全省小学生不到三十万人，大学生只有一千多人。长期的反动统治，留给甘肃人民的只是一部血泪史。
    解放后的甘肃——拨云见天，安居乐业
    解放以后，甘肃人民是拨开乌云见青天。在共产党和人民政府领导下，在各方面取得了巨大的成就。特别是一九五六年，更是大变革、大发展的一年。这一年的成就，大大超过了一九四九到一九五五这六年。到一九五六年底，甘肃已经基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，社会主义建设也获得了空前的成绩，全省已经有三百多个生产厂矿，正在建设的有六十多个厂矿，其中包括炼油厂、石油机械厂、热电站等十几个大型工业。职工增加到三十万人，现代工业的产值，在工农业总产值中所占的比重，已经上升到百分之十五点八六。粮食产量，达到一百零九亿斤。已经从历史上的缺粮的省份变为余粮的省份。百分之九十的农业社增加了生产，百分之八十五的社员增加了收入。大量的旱地变成了水地，单是一九五六年增加的水浇地就达到四百三十六万亩，超过了解放后六年间所修水浇地面积的总和，相当于解放前几千年间所有水浇地面积的一半还多。在最干旱的地区，有一百多个乡，由于水地增加，已经可以摆脱一般旱灾的威胁。新修的铁路有一千五百多公里，正式通车的有八百多公里。公路达到一万四千多公里，县县通汽车，区区有电话。就连历史上以艰险著名的阴平古道（文县），在一九五六年也修通了公路。全省小学生增加到一百一十六万多人，大学生增加到六千多人，单是群众集体举办的小学就有三千多所，学生十六万多人。全省社会秩序，空前安定，人民群众，安居乐业，生活有了显著的改善，农民购买力从一九五○年平均每人六元提高到四十五元，全省棉布销售量从一九五○年的九十五万多匹增加到四百三十多万匹。各民族人民已经结成了平等团结、友爱合作的新关系，这个关系，在共同建设社会主义的基础上，正在一天比一天加强。现在，全省人民正以无比的热情，努力把甘肃建设成为祖国的一个社会主义的新的工业基地。长期以来，甘肃人民梦寐以求的理想，正在逐步地实现。
    从解放前后的甘肃情况的对照中，从甘肃八年来特别是一九五六年以来的发展变化中，说明什么问题呢？它生动地表明了，共产党的领导是正确的，人民民主专政和社会主义制度是优越的，八年来的成就是伟大的。它有力地证明了右派论调的彻底破产。
    我们并不掩饰工作中的缺点和错误
    在肯定成绩的时候，我们并不否认在八年来的工作中发生过缺点和错误，也并不放松应有的努力来纠正这些缺点和错误。共产党和人民政府是从来不掩饰自己的缺点和错误的。尽管这些缺点和错误是个别的，而且其中有些确是难以避免或者难以完全避免的，我们也决不加以忽视，只要一有发现，就想办法纠正，并且从中取得教训。特别是甘肃地区各项建设事业发展很快，而原有的基础很差，我们的经验又很不足，更需要随时注意，力求正确地认识客观实际，正确地辨明是非，尽量少犯错误，不重复过去的错误，不使小错误变为大错误。但是，无论如何，我们的缺点和错误，同成绩比较起来，毕竟是极其次要的，而且决不是不可克服的。右派分子故意夸大缺点，颠倒黑白，把我们的工作说得“一团糟”，实际上是完全蔑视广大人民和干部的劳动成果，竭力打击广大人民的积极性和创造性，企图中伤我们社会主义的事业，进而否定共产党的领导，否定人民民主专政和社会主义制度，以便为资本主义开辟道路。这难道还不明显吗？
    当然，立场的不同，思想感情的不同，对于好和“糟”的看法，必然也是不同的。就拿社会主义革命来说，把几千年的生产资料私有制改变成为社会主义公有制，在广大人民看来，是挖掉了穷根，是天大的好事；而在右派分子看来，则是挖掉了命根，是天大的糟事。他们特别感到痛心疾首，也是很自然的。右派分子总是不肯承认自己的立场有问题，其实他们的反动的阶级本能早就把他们的真面目赤裸裸地暴露在人民面前了。
    右派分子既不了解人民，也不了解自己
    像一切狂妄的野心家一样，右派分子是毫无自知之明的。他们既不了解人民，也不了解自己。他们把自己估计得太高了，把人民估计得太低了，以为人民是可以愚弄的。他们以代表人民说话的姿态出现，到处点火，以为这样一来，人民就会跟他们走，共产党就会垮台。北京的储安平，承章、罗联盟之命，不辞千里迢迢，派记者到兰州点火，给甘肃的右派分子撑腰。他们的利令智昏可以说是达于极点了。而结果呢？火是点起来了，可是并不像右派分子想的那么美妙，燃烧起来的是全国人民反右派的怒火。玩火者必自焚。这对于右派分子说来，应该是一个极其辛辣的教训。现在，右派分子已经陷于孤立。如果他们不想自绝于人民，就必须立即洗心革面，向人民作彻底的交代，求得人民的宽大处理，否则，真要后悔莫及了。
    反右派的斗争，是政治上、思想上的一场阶级斗争，是社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。对待右派分子不能温情，对右派温情，就是对人民寡情。我们必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，同全国人民一道，把反右派斗争进行到底，并且在斗争中锻炼和提高自己。我相信，在中国共产党领导下，我们的社会主义事业一定要胜利，也一定能够胜利。
