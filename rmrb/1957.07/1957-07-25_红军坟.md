    Red Army Grave
    Niè Zhìyǔ
    The closer the car got to Zunyi, the more excited we became.
    As we neared Zunyi City, it started to drizzle. The small mountains south of the city turned from bright to dim, and the small river between the city and the mountains was shrouded in mist.
    Despite the fleeting clouds and drizzling rain, people could still see a plume of white smoke rising from the mountain across the way. It rose higher and higher, gradually expanding in area, and finally mixed with the low-hanging clouds, from which the rain fell to the ground.
    We stood in the rain, and the driver pointed to that place, saying, "That's the Red Army Grave!"
    Legend has it that in the spring of 1935, the Red Army, on its northward march, passed through here and stayed in the nearby villages, sharing the same air and conversing with the locals. Sadly, the good times didn't last. One dark and rainy night, the Kuomintang army chased after them. In order to preserve their strength and continue the fight against the Japanese, the Red Army had to pack up and set off again. Just as the medical battalion was getting ready, a farmer covered in mud ran over. He wept and told the battalion commander that his only son was seriously ill and begged for a doctor to treat him.
    All the doctors and nurses heard him. Should they go? If they did, they would inevitably be unable to follow the team and would fall into the hands of the enemy. But how could they stand by and watch someone die? A young doctor in his twenties, after consulting with the battalion commander, resolutely went.
    That night, the Kuomintang army entered Zunyi. The young doctor was captured and buried alive on the small mountain south of the city.
    Although this Red Army doctor died, his kind heart and heroic posture were deeply imprinted in the hearts of the local people. For decades, regardless of wind, rain, severe cold, or scorching heat, they would travel from dozens of miles away to burn incense and paper money. During the Kuomintang rule, they dug up the grave and opened the coffin several times, throwing the bones into the ravines to destroy the people's memory of him, but the people risked their lives to retrieve them again and again, bury them in their original place, and continue to burn incense and cultivate the soil. Over time, the grave grew larger and larger, like a hilltop on this mountain, becoming the now famous Red Army Grave.
    Looking at the plume of smoke rising from the small mountain, we were moved by this story and, without eating, braved the rain to climb to the top of the mountain to mourn this praiseworthy and moving Red Army Grave.
    In front of the grave, there was a large ceramic basin, and bundles of incense sticks were gathered together, burning intensely in the light rain, with wisps of green smoke rising straight into the sky. The grave was surrounded by wreaths woven from various flowers and plants. Old ladies, women, and old grandfathers constantly climbed up the mountain to light the incense and paper money they had brought in the ceramic basin, silently paying their respects in the mud.
    As the old ladies left, a steady stream of people continued to come up, and the incense fire in front of the grave never ceased.
    As we descended the mountain with heavy hearts, the rain stopped, and sunlight pierced through a cloud, enveloping the hilltop. Looking back, the plume of smoke in front of the grave was even clearer.

    红军坟
    聂志予
    车子离遵义越近，我们的心情就越加激动了。
    快到遵义城时，天却稀稀啦啦地下起雨来。城南的小山由明亮变得黯暗，城和山中间的那条小河也网在雾气中了。
    尽管浮云飞驰，细雨绵绵，人们仍可见对面山头上卷起来的一柱白烟，它越升越高，面积也逐渐大起来，最后和低沉的云彩混在一起，雨就从中降到地下。
    我们站在雨水里，司机遥指着那地方说：“那就是红军坟！”
    传说在1935年春天，北上的红军经过这儿，并分宿在附近的村庄，同老乡们共同呼吸，互相畅谈。可惜，好景不常！在一个漆黑而阴雨的夜晚，国民党军队追来了，红军为了保存实力，继续北上抗日，只好又整装出发。卫生营的大夫刚刚整顿完毕，一位满身泥水的农民跑来了。他哭着向营长述说，他的独生子害了重病，请医生去医治。
    所有的医生、护士也都听到了。去不去呢？要去，势必不能跟着队伍出发，就会落到敌人手里。但是又怎能见死不救？一位二十多岁的青年医生，请示过营长以后，就毅然地去了。
    当夜，国民党军队进入遵义。这个年青医生被捕了，并被活活地埋在城南的小山上。
    这位红军医生虽然死去，可他善良的心灵和英勇的姿态却深深地刻印在当地百姓的心里。已经是几十个年头了，他们不管刮风下雨，或严寒酷暑，都远从几十里路赶来，烧香烧纸。国民党统治时，曾几次掘坟开棺，把骨头丢到山沟里来毁灭人们对他怀念的那颗心，可老百姓却冒着生命，一次又一次的拣回来，埋到原地，并不断烧香培土。这样，天长日久，坟也就大起来，像这山上的一个山头，成为现在有名的红军坟。
    看着由小山上升起的烟柱，我们被这故事激动着，没有吃饭，就冒雨爬到山顶，去哀念这座可歌可泣的红军坟。
    在坟前，有很大一个磁盆，一束束的香集在一起，在微雨中浓烈地烧着，一股股青烟直冲云霄。坟的四周围满了用各种花草编的花圈。老太太、妇女、老爷爷，不断地爬上山来，把带来的香纸点燃在磁盆里。在泥泞里默默地行礼。
    老太太走了，又有人川流不息地上来，坟前的香火永不息灭。
    当我们负着沉重的感情下山时，雨住了，太阳光由一片云里钻出来，罩住山头，回头看看，坟前烟柱更清晰了。
