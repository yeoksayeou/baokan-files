I completely agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I would like to say a few words on the following points.

    Rapid Development of Industry and Agriculture in Anhui, Changing the Backward Outlook
    (1) The right-wing elements do not allow us to talk about achievements. They slander "achievements are fundamental, and shortcomings are individual" as "dogmatism." As the saying goes, "Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone." Their intention is to exaggerate shortcomings, obliterate achievements, and reverse black and white, in order to slander the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, thereby achieving the goal of opposing communism and socialism, and implementing capitalist restoration. That's their conspiracy.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our great motherland has victoriously carried out the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, basically completing the socialist revolution and achieving great achievements in socialist construction. This is a fact as obvious as the sun and the moon in the sky, shouldn't we talk about it? Shouldn't we talk about it a lot and especially? We still talk too little about achievements, not too much. I grew up in Anhui and am more familiar with Anhui's affairs, so now I will cite a few achievements of Anhui's work, and Anhui's achievements are an inseparable part of the national achievements.
    As everyone knows, before liberation, Anhui was the most backward province in the Yangtze River basin. Apart from the Huainan Coal Mine, the Taoqi Iron Mine operated by Japanese imperialists, and the Yuzhong Cotton Mill, there was no modern industry; apart from Wuhu, a declining rice market, there was no large-scale commerce either. After liberation, things changed. Anhui's face is changing rapidly. Many cities have changed their face, especially Hefei, which has completely changed its old appearance. After land reform and agricultural cooperation, the old, poor, and bankrupt rural areas have been thoroughly renewed, and a prosperous atmosphere is growing day by day.
    In terms of industry and mining: Before liberation, the textile industry had only 22,000 spindles, which had increased to 84,000 spindles by last year. Before liberation, the Huainan Coal Mine's highest annual output was only 1.6 million tons, now the annual output has increased to about 3 million tons, with a daily output of more than 10,000 tons. Before liberation, only a few cities such as Wuhu, Bengbu, Anqing, and Hefei had small thermal power plants for lighting. Now, most cities have electric lights, and many villages also have electric lights. The power generation capacity of hydropower stations such as Fozi Ridge, Meishan, Xianghongdian, and Mozitan is 100,000 kilowatts. The total industrial output value in 1949 was only 90,032,200 yuan, which had increased to 795,519,100 yuan in 1956, an increase of 7.83 times in six years. With the growth of industrial and mining production, the wages of workers have also increased year by year, growing by 141.8 percent from 1950 to 1955.
    Looking at agriculture again: Not to mention the distant past, just looking at 1956, the year after the province's agricultural cooperation, the year was affected by natural disasters such as drought, flood, and typhoons, and the extent of the disaster far exceeded 1954, a year of severe disaster. However, because the farmers had been organized, they overcame the disaster. The grain output this year was 23 billion jin, an increase of 300 million jin compared to the bumper year of 1955, which was 22.7 billion jin. Under this test, the superiority of cooperation was powerfully revealed. It shut the mouths of those who opposed cooperation. The achievements of the Huai River harnessing project are huge, and I don't need to say more. As everyone knows, old Anhui was a disaster-prone province, and northern Anhui was a famous area where "nine out of ten years were barren." The experience of farmer Zhou Dengliang in Huaiyuan County is a good illustration. Before liberation, Zhou Dengliang sold his sister to others for a dou of rice due to disaster. Now, his whole family is not only self-sufficient, but also had a surplus of 200 yuan last year under such disaster conditions. Farmers' income has been growing year by year after liberation. According to a survey of poor peasant components in the Jianghuai cooperative in Feixi County, it has increased by 132.8 percent in six years. The sales volume of daily necessities in rural areas also illustrates this growth: In 1955, the average person purchased 17.85 chi of cotton cloth and 0.88 pieces of soap. In 1956, the average person purchased 20.6 chi of cotton cloth and 0.93 pieces of soap. The ratio of industrial and agricultural product values is also changing. In 1950, 100 jin of rice could be exchanged for 27.28 chi of foreign cloth and 19.23 bars of Sunlight soap. In 1955, it could be exchanged for 32.92 chi of foreign cloth and 24.24 bars of Sunlight soap. In the past, farmers had to hand over 70 percent of their income to landlords. Now, agricultural tax accounts for about 7 percent of farmers' net income, and what is handed over to the state through price differences accounts for about 5 percent, totaling about 12 percent of farmers' net income. Aren't these facts enough to show that our achievements are fundamental? No, our achievements are great. The farmers of Shuangqiao cooperative in Xuancheng County said: "Our cooperative has 20,000 people and more than 57,000 mu of land. In the past, there was water for the New Year but no water for farming. Now the dams have been built; the government also spent 70,000 yuan to build a hydroelectric power station for us without asking us for a penny. In the past, minor illnesses would be resisted, and major illnesses would lead to death. Now minor illnesses can be treated, and major illnesses can be treated in hospitals. With the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the government, farmers are fully confident in producing and building socialism. We are moving towards socialism, but the right-wing elements want to block our way. We want to ask the right-wing elements, why don't you want the Communist Party's leadership? Why don't you want socialism?"
    Yes, I also want to ask the right-wing elements, if our shortcomings are really as exaggerated as you say, could Anhui's face have undergone such a great change? Could it have changed so quickly?

    Right-Wing Elements Dislike the People's Legal System and Falsely Accuse Our Country of "Having No Laws to Follow"
    (2) The right-wing elements falsely accuse our country, saying that there is "no law to follow, laws are not followed," "emphasizing rule by man, and neglecting the rule of law," and other such nonsense. They want to portray our country as having no legal system, and then put on a false pretense of being a patriot, secretly bringing in the legal systems of European and American capitalist countries. The task of our country's legal system is to eliminate exploitation, eliminate capitalist ownership; establish and protect socialist ownership, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. The reason why bourgeois right-wing elements want to wantonly slander the socialist legal system is to overthrow it. Some people, deceived or influenced by the right-wing elements, criticize us, saying that there is "no law to follow" or "resolutions, orders, and instructions replace laws." These statements are wrong. Since the founding of our country, in addition to the Constitution, we have successively formulated many important laws, such as the Trade Union Law, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the Land Reform Law, the Marriage Law, the Military Service Law, the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries, the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, the Regulations on Arrest and Detention, the Model Constitution of Agricultural Cooperatives, the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy, the Electoral Law, the People's Police Regulations, and so on. We have also formulated many administrative regulations, individual regulations, as well as decisions and instructions, totaling thousands of items. Why don't those who say "there is no law to follow" take a look at these facts? Of course, our legal system is not yet complete, but those people hope that we can formulate a complete set of laws at the time of the founding of the country, or at the same time as the promulgation of the Constitution. This wish is good, but it does not conform to objective facts. As everyone knows, law is a superstructure created by a foundation and serving its own foundation. Its emergence must be paved by the social economy. That is to say, certain interests prescribed by the current economic relations are reflected in people's consciousness in some way, and then rise to the will of law. Therefore, law must develop with the development of the social economy and gradually become complete. It cannot transcend the reality of economic relations. This is the law of social development that does not depend on people's will. Even in the capitalist society that the right-wing elements yearn for, it is no exception. Who can say that capitalist countries had a complete set of laws at the time of their founding? What's more, capitalism precedes feudal society, while we have to establish socialism on "empty ground." Moreover, our country is in a period of transition, with new things constantly emerging and old things constantly dying. The changes are so drastic and so rapid. It is impossible to formulate a complete set of laws that are both applicable to today and applicable to tomorrow in such a period of rapid change. Therefore, in order to adapt to this rapid and constantly updating situation, what is wrong with us using resolutions, orders, and instructions to solve some new problems and contradictions in national work, and to supplement laws that take a long time to formulate and amend? Moreover, they themselves are a legal system and play a legal role. Some people object to adding the words "trial implementation" and "provisional implementation" when passing regulations. They advocate that "legislation is to tie hands and feet." You need to know that the words "trial implementation" and "provisional implementation" are precisely a reflection of our current rapidly changing economic situation. As for the role of law, it is true that it lies in having a certain binding force, but this binding force must be constantly changed with the constantly updating economic relations. Do we have to formulate a set of laws to tie our hands and feet and no longer move forward? Marx said it well: "In a democracy, man is not made for the law, but the law is made for man; here the human existence is the law."
    In fact, only countries under the leadership of the working class attach the most importance to the legal system. It is the people's legal system, and the right-wing elements do not like this legal system.
    As far as our legislative work is concerned, thanks to the experience of one or twenty years in the liberated areas and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, our work has been smooth and has achieved great results. Of course, there are shortcomings. Many people have put forward sincere criticisms and expectations for our legislative work. As a worker participating in legislative work, I express my heartfelt welcome.

    The Only Way Out for Right-Wing Elements - Sincerely Confess and Start Anew
    (3) The right-wing elements have carried out extremely shameless rumors and slanders against the socialist society built by the Communist Party leading the people of the whole country, saying that we are a complete mess, and dreaming of creating a Hungarian incident in China. Therefore, they took advantage of the opportunity of the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" and the rectification campaign to move around, ignite fires everywhere, and stir up waves, trying to create chaos in the world. But in the people's angry counterattack, right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, and Huang Shaohong have gradually revealed their ugly true colors. Especially Zhang Bojun, a giant of the right-wing elements, is the most cunning political swindler. He has always boasted of himself as a Marxist. In fact, his mind is filled with nothing but the American merchant philosophy, the British parliamentary politics, and the Huang-Lao power strategies of the old Chinese era. This is the ideological root of his anti-communist and anti-socialist thinking. His series of reactionary words and deeds are being exposed in various aspects, and I will not say more. As for the depravity of his personal morals, even the old society cannot tolerate it. For a period of time, he tried his best to conceal this kind of thinking. However, seeing that the socialist revolution has achieved a great victory, his reactionary emotions were aroused. After the events in Poland and Hungary occurred, he thought the time had come, so he carried out vigorous activities. On the one hand, he formed an alliance with Luo Longji; on the other hand, within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, he supported some people who were extremely unpopular, guilty of many crimes, and even had connections with secret agents, and took control of the leadership of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. During the Communist Party's rectification campaign, he sent out backbones to ignite fires everywhere. In Beijing alone, in just over a month, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held more than 20 symposiums for senior intellectuals, igniting fires in six fields: health, science, culture and education, and politics and law. Over the years, although I have struggled against Zhang Bojun's erroneous thoughts and behaviors, I have not been able to expose and criticize his anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy in a timely manner. As one of the central leaders of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, I also have a certain responsibility. Now, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has launched a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements headed by Zhang Bojun. Facts have proved that the majority of people in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party are determined to follow the Communist Party and take the socialist road. The right-wing elements are obviously isolated now. Their only way out is to thoroughly confess all kinds of conspiracies and activities, wash their hearts and change their minds, and start anew. Otherwise, not only the comrades of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, but the people of the whole country will continue to wage a resolute struggle against them, and will never stop until complete victory.

### 农工民主党的大多数人坚决跟着共产党走  何世琨的发言

    农工民主党的大多数人坚决跟着共产党走
    何世琨的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李先念、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的各项报告，并就以下几点，说几句话。
    安徽工农业生产迅速发展，落后的面貌正在改变
    （一）右派分子不准我们说成绩。他们把“成绩是基本的，缺点是个别的”，诬蔑为“教条主义”。古语说：“司马昭之心，路人皆见”，他们的用心，就是要夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，颠倒黑白，以图污蔑伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，从而达到反共反社会主义，实行资本主义复辟的目的。他们的阴谋就是这样。
    我们伟大的祖国在共产党领导下，胜利地进行了五大运动、三大改造，基本上完成了社会主义革命，取得了社会主义建设的伟大成就，这是如日月经天的事实，难道不应该说吗？难道不应该大说而特说吗？我们对于成绩还是说得太少，而不是说得太多。我生长于安徽，对于安徽事情更熟悉些，所以我现在就举出几项安徽的工作成绩来说一说，而安徽的成绩是全国成绩的一个不可分割的部分。
    大家知道，在解放前，安徽是长江流域一个最落后的省份，除淮南煤矿、日本帝国主义者经营的桃溪铁矿及裕中纱厂外，就没有近代的工业；除芜湖这个日趋衰落的米市场外，也没有大商业。解放后，不同了。安徽的面貌正在迅速改变着。许多城市已在改变面貌，特别是合肥已完全改变了旧时的面貌，经过土改，经过农业合作化，旧的、穷困破产的农村，已得了彻底更新，兴旺的气象正与日俱增。
    工矿业方面：解放前纺织业只有二万二千纱锭，到去年止已增为八万四千纱锭。解放前淮南煤矿年产额最高才一百六十万吨，现在年产额增到三百万吨左右，每日可产一万多吨。解放前只是芜湖、蚌埠、安庆、合肥等少数城市有供照明用的小型火力电厂，现在除大部分城市有电灯外，许多乡村也有了电灯。佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭等水力发电站发电能力在十万瓩。一九四九年的工业总产值仅仅九千零三十二万二千元，到一九五六年已增为七亿九千五百十九万一千元，六年之间，增加了七点八三倍。随着工矿业生产的增长，职工的工资也在逐年增加，从一九五○年到一九五五年，增长达百分之一百四十一点八。
    再看农业：远的不说，单就全省农业合作化以后的一九五六年来看，这一年受到旱、涝、台风等自然灾害，灾情的广度，远超过一九五四年这个重灾年。但是，由于农民已经组织起来了，战胜了灾害。这一年粮食产量为二百三十亿斤，比丰收之年，即一九五五年的二百二十七亿斤，还增产了三亿斤。在这个考验下，合作化的优越性有力地显露出来了。一下堵住了那些反对合作化的人的嘴巴。治淮工程的成绩巨大，更不待我多说。大家知道，旧安徽是个多灾的省份，淮北更是有名的“十年到有九年荒”的地区。怀远县农民周登良的经历就是一个很好的说明。解放以前，周登良因遭灾荒，曾以一斗米，把妹妹卖给人家，现在他全家不但够吃够用，就在去年那样的灾情下，还多余了二百元。解放后农民收入是逐年增长的，据肥西县江淮社对贫农成分的调查，六年之间，增长达百分之一百三十二点八。农村日用品的销售量，也说明了这个增长的事实：一九五五年平均每人购买棉布一七点八五尺；肥皂零点八八块。一九五六年平均每人是棉布二十点六尺；肥皂零点九三块。工农业产品价值的比例也在改变，一百斤大米，一九五○年换二七点二八尺洋布；一九点二三条日光皂。一九五五年换三二点九二尺洋布；二四点二四条日光皂。过去农民要以收入的百分之七十交给地主，现在，农业税约占农民纯收入的百分之七，通过差价而交给国家的约占百分之五，两共占农民纯收入的百分之十二。这些事实，难道还不足以说明我们成绩是基本的吗？不，我们的成绩是伟大的。宣城县双桥社农民说：“我们社有两万人，五万七千多亩田，过去是有水过年无水做田，现在水坝修起来了；政府还花了七万元给我们建筑一个水力发电站，不要我们一文钱。过去小病即抵，大病即死。现在小病即医，大病住医院，有共产党的领导，政府的支持，农民的生产，建设社会主义是完全有把握的。我们正向社会主义走，右派分子却想截着我们的路。我们要问右派分子，为什么不要共产党领导？为什么不要社会主义”？
    是的，我也要问右派分子，如果我们的缺点真的像你们所夸大的那样，安徽面貌能够有这样大的改变吗？能够变化得这样快吗？右派分子不喜人民的法制一口诬蔑我国“无法可依”
    （二）右派分子诬蔑我们国家，说什么“无法可依，有法不依”，“重人治，轻法治”等等之类的谰言。他们想把我们国家说成没有法制的状态，然后摆出一副好像真是一个爱国主义者的假样子，偷偷搬来欧美资本主义国家的法制。我国法制的任务在于消灭剥削，消灭资本主义所有制；确立和保护社会主义所有制，巩固人民民主专政。资产阶级右派分子之所以对于社会主义法制，肆意诬蔑，其目的就是要推翻它。有一些人受了右派分子的蒙蔽或影响，批评我们说，“无法可循”或“以决议、命令、指示代替法律”，这些说法是错误的。我国自开国以来，除宪法外，已先后制订了许多重要的法律，如工会法、劳动保险条例、土地改革法、婚姻法、兵役法、惩治反革命条例、惩治贪污条例、逮捕拘留条例、农业合作社示范章程、民族区域自治实施纲要、选举法、人民警察条例等等，还制订了许多行政法规、单行条例以及决定和指示，共数千件。说“无法可依”的人，何以不去看看这些事实？诚然，我们的法制，现在还没有完备，但那些人希望我们在开国之时，或与宪法颁布同时，就制定出一套完备的法律，这种愿望是好的，但却不符合客观事实。大家知道，法律是一种由基础所创立的、并为自己基础服务的上层建筑。它的产生必须由社会经济为它铺好道路。也就是说，由当前经济关系所规定的一定利益，以某种方式反映于人们意识中，从而上升为法的意志。因此，法律必须是随着社会经济的发展而发展，而逐渐得到完备的。它不可能超越现实经济关系。这是不依人们意志为转移的社会发展规律，就是在右派分子所向往的资本主义社会，也不能例外。谁能说，资本主义国家在开国之时，就有一套完备的法律吗？何况，资本主义是先行于封建社会之内的，而我们却要在“空地”上建立社会主义。更何况，我们国家正处在过渡时期，新的不断在兴起，旧的不断在死亡，变化是这样剧烈，又是这样迅速。要在这样激变时期一下制定出一套完备的既适用于今天又适用于明天的法律，是不可能的。因此，为着适应这种迅速的、不断更新的情况，我们以决议、命令、指示来解决国家工作中某些新生的问题和矛盾，来补充在制定和修改上都要较长时间的法律，有什么不好呢？况且它们本身就是法制，起了法律作用。有人反对在通过规章时加上“试行”、“暂行”的字样，他主张“立法就是要束手束脚”。要知道，“试行”、“暂行”字样，正是我们当前剧烈变革的经济情况的反映。至于法的作用，诚然在于有一定约束力，但是这种约束力必然要随着不断更新的经济关系，而不断改变的。难道我们必须制定一套法律来把自己手脚束缚起来，不再前进一步吗？马克思说得好：“在民主制中，不是人为法律而存在，而是法律为人而存在，在这里人的存在就是法律。”
    事实上，世界上只有工人阶级领导下的国家最重法制，它是人民的法制，右派分子是不喜欢这种法制的。
    就我们立法工作说，由于有了解放区一、二十年的经验，由于有了苏联的和其他人民民主国家的先进经验，我们的工作是顺利的，并已取得了很大的成绩，当然，缺点是有的。许多人对于我们立法工作提出了善意的批评和期望，我作为参加立法工作的一个工作者，表示衷心的欢迎。
    右派分子的唯一出路——切实交代，重新做人
    （三）右派分子对于共产党领导全国人民建设的社会主义社会，进行了极端无耻的造谣和污蔑，说我们是漆黑一团，梦想在中国制造出一个匈牙利事件。于是他们利用百家争鸣和整风的机会，四出活动，到处点火，推涛作浪，想造成天下大乱。可是在人民的愤怒反击中，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、黄绍竑等等右派分子，已逐渐露出了丑恶的原形。特别像右派分子巨头章伯钧，就是一个最狡猾的政治骗子，他一向把自己吹嘘为一个马克思主义者。其实，充满于他的脑子，只是美国的商人哲学、英国的议会政治和中国旧时代的黄老权术，这是他反共反社会主义的思想根源。他的一系列的反动言行，各方面都在进行揭露，我就不再多说，至于他的私人道德的恶劣，虽在旧社会也不能容。他曾有一个时期，竭力把这种思想掩蔽着，可是，他眼看社会主义革命已取得伟大的胜利，他的反动的情感激动起来了，在波匈的事件发生后，他认为时机已到，便大肆活动。一面和罗隆基结成联盟；一面在农工民主党内，把他左右一些民愤极大、罪恶多端、甚至与特务有联系的人，扶植起来，把持农工民主党的领导，在共产党整风期间，派出骨干，四出点火。仅就北京一地来说，不过一个月光景，就由农工民主党北京市委会召开了高级知识分子座谈会二十余次，向卫生、科学、文教、政法等六个方面点火。这些年来，虽然我对于章伯钧的错误的思想和行为，曾进行过斗争，而他反共反社会主义的阴谋，竟发展到这种程度，却没有得到及时的揭发和批判，作为农工民主党中央负责人之一，我也要负有一定责任。现在，农工民主党对于以章伯钧为首的右派分子，已展开了坚决的斗争，事实证明：农工民主党中大多数人是坚决跟着共产党走的，坚决走社会主义的路。右派分子，很明显，现在已经孤立了。他们的出路只有一条，那就是必须彻底交代出各种阴谋活动，洗心革面，重新做人。否则，不仅农工民主党同志，全国人民都同他们继续进行坚决的斗争，不获全胜决不收兵。
