    The Beauty of Life
    – Thoughts After Seeing the Uday Shankar Dance Troupe Performance

    The Chinese audience, captivated by the charming and wonderful Indian dance, once again had the rare opportunity on a refreshing summer night to appreciate the superb performance of Mr. Uday Shankar, a remarkably creative contemporary Indian artist, his wife, the famous dancer Amala Shankar, and all the artists of the Shankar Dance Troupe.

    What was it that attracted the entire audience so much? For those of us who love Indian dance, it wasn’t just the familiar and cleverly changing hand gestures, the moving eyes, and the graceful dance postures that made us concentrate, afraid of losing even a moment of enjoyment; it was the warm current of love for people and love for life that ran through the entire performance. It constantly excited us and infected us. Even in the performances about the legends of gods, we could still feel the spirit of people and the breath of life. Perhaps this is the "cultural aspiration" and "dream" that Mr. Uday Shankar pursues and wants to express!

    I cannot describe my feelings after watching the performance; I can only say that I have gained some new things. These are just like what Mr. Uday Shankar said: "Artists have so much to contribute to the people and receive from the people!" It is precisely this kind of art that belongs to the people that makes us—the Chinese people and the Indian people—"come closer and unite." Zhu Shulan

    生活的美
    ——看乌黛·香卡舞蹈团演出的随感
    倾倒于那富有魅力和美妙的印度舞蹈的中国观众，在清新的夏夜，又一次获得难得的机会，欣赏了印度当代具有非凡创造性的大艺术家乌黛·香卡先生和他的夫人、著名的舞蹈家亚玛娜·香卡，以及香卡舞蹈团全体艺术家们精湛的表演。
    是什么那样吸引住全场的观众？对于我们这些爱好印度舞蹈的人来说，不仅仅是我们久已熟悉变化巧妙的手势、动人的眼神和婀娜的舞姿，使我们凝神贯注，惟恐失去那怕是一瞬间的享受的，是贯穿着全部演出节目的对人的热爱、对生活的热爱的那股暖流。它不停地激动着我们，感染着我们。即使在表现关于神的传说里，我们仍能感到人的精神和生活的气息。这也许就是乌黛·香卡先生所追求和要表露的“文化热望”和“梦想”！
    我无法形容看完演出后的心情，我只能说我又获得了一些新的东西。这些正像是乌黛·香卡先生所说的：“艺术家所能贡献给人民并从人民获得的东西真不少啊！”也正是这种属于人民的艺术，使得我们——中国人民和印度人民“彼此接近并联合起来”。　朱树兰
