Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 16th - Karamay has been built into a petroleum city with a preliminary scale. The Preparatory Committee of Karamay City was formally established on the 12th and began preparing for the establishment of the city. The city's jurisdiction includes not only Karamay, which serves as an oilfield base, but also the surrounding exploration areas of Zhongguai, Daguai, Baijitan, and Wuerhe, covering a total area of more than 5,000 square kilometers.

    The construction speed of the Karamay petroleum base is rare in China's industrial construction. Two years ago, within thousands of square kilometers around Karamay, there were no residents except for the field geologists who were looking for oil. In 1955, the first residents of Karamay, a drilling team of more than 30 drilling workers, came here to explore the underground oil secrets. Since then, through two years of arduous large-scale drilling activities, petroleum drilling workers have confirmed that Karamay is a large oil area with great industrial value, explored a considerable oil storage area, and found recoverable crude oil reserves that have greatly exceeded the national task of exploring reserves in the Xinjiang region within the first five-year plan.

    With the discovery of this oilfield and the continuous expansion of the drilling scale, the number of employees in the mining area has surged from more than 30 in 1955 to more than 15,000 now (including construction, installation, and other employees). Together with the families of the employees, the current population is nearly 30,000. However, before July of last year, Karamay did not have a single permanent house. In June of last year, after it was finally confirmed that there was industrially valuable oil here, the construction of the oilfield base was launched. In a short year, the construction workers in the mining area overcame the numerous difficulties of water shortage, soil shortage, and the need to transport every brick and every piece of wood from other places, and built more than 100,000 square meters of earthen, wooden, and brick-wood structures for houses and machine repair workshops. The Gobi Desert, which was originally barren, now stands with a neat and brand-new array of houses. In the petroleum city, there are office buildings for the party and government leading organs of the mining area, 142 employee dormitories, departments such as trade, post and telecommunications, banks, and bookstores, as well as employee hospitals, nurseries, children's schools, employee cultural schools, clubs, and more than 20 employee canteens. Now, the employees of the mining area have moved from tents and temporary cellars into new houses, and more than 800 families of employees have also come from faraway places to reunite and settle down here.

    The problem of water used for living and production, which had always seriously threatened people's lives, has now been basically solved. A 42-kilometer-long underground water pipeline was connected from the banks of the Manas River to the petroleum city in June this year. This water pipeline can currently transport more than 2,000 cubic meters of water from the Manas River every day to supply production and domestic water. Now, the water used for drilling and factories in the vicinity of Karamay can be guaranteed. The domestic water supply in the residential area has been fully supplied. Many tap water faucets and reservoirs have also been built here. Residents can conveniently fetch water for use in front of their doors.

    The formerly desolate Karamay has now changed its appearance. In the residential area, the sky above a row of houses in light red and milky white is filled with crisscrossing power lines, telephone lines, and broadcasting lines. Melodious broadcasting music wafts through the air, and cars and trucks of all sizes shuttle back and forth on the roads, with crowds of people coming and going. In the industrial area, machines roar, welding sparks flash, and at night, there is a sea of lights everywhere. By the end of this year, more than 100,000 square meters of buildings will appear here.

### 两年以前，这里还没有一户居民……  克拉玛依变成了三万人的城市

    两年以前，这里还没有一户居民……
    克拉玛依变成了三万人的城市
    新华社克拉玛依16日电  克拉玛依已经被建成为一座初具规模的石油城。克拉玛依市筹备委员会12日正式宣布成立，开始进行建立市的筹备工作。这个市的管辖范围除作为油田基地的克拉玛依以外，还包括周围中拐、大拐、白碱滩、乌尔禾等探区，全部面积达五千多平方公里。
    克拉玛依石油基地的建设速度在我国工业建设中是少有的。两年以前，克拉玛依周围几千平方公里，除流动在这里找寻石油的野外地质人员以外，没有一户居民。 1955年，克拉玛依第一批居民由三十多名钻井工人组成的一支钻井队，来到这里探索地下的石油秘密。从那时开始，石油钻探职工经过两年艰苦的大规模钻探活动，证实了克拉玛依是一个有很大工业价值的大油区，探明了相当可观的一片储油面积，找到的可采原油储量已经大大超过国家在第一个五年计划内要求新疆地区探明的储量任务。
    随着这个油田的发现和钻探规模不断扩大，矿区职工人数从1955年的三十多人激增到现在的一万五千多人（包括建筑、安装等职工在内），连同职工家属，目前有将近三万人口。但在去年7月以前，克拉玛依还没有一间永久性的房屋。去年6月间，这里最后被证实有工业价值含油以后，才展开油田基地的建设工作。在短暂的一年中，矿区建筑工人克服了缺水、缺土和一块砖、一根木头都要从外地运输的重重困难，建成十多万平方公尺的土木结构、砖木结构的房屋和机修厂房。原来寸草不生的戈壁上，现在林立着一片整齐而崭新的房屋。在石油城里，有矿区党政领导机关办公的房屋，有一百四十二幢职工宿舍，有贸易、邮电、银行、书店等部门以及职工医院、托儿所、子弟学校、职工文化学校、俱乐部和二十多个职工食堂。现在矿区职工都已经从帐篷、临时地窖迁进新屋居住，有八百多户职工家属也从遥远的地方来到这里团聚落户。
    过去一直严重威胁人们的生活和生产用水问题，现在已经基本上得到解决。一条敷设在地下的长达四十二公里的输水管线，今年6月间从玛纳斯河畔通向石油城。这条输水管线目前每天能从玛纳斯河输水两千多立方公尺供应生产和生活用水。现在克拉玛依附近地区的钻井和工厂用水都能得到保证。住宅区的生活用水已经充分供应。这里还修建了好多自来水龙头和蓄水池。居民可以很方便地在自己门前取水使用。
    原来荒无人烟的克拉玛依，现在已经改变了以前的面貌。在住宅区，一片淡红色和乳白色相间的房屋上空，满布着纵横交错的输电线、电话线、广播线，空中飘荡着悠扬的广播音乐声，马路上大小汽车往来如梭，人群熙来攘往。在工业区，机器轰鸣，焊火闪闪，入夜，四处一片灯光。到今年底，这里还将有十多万平方公尺的建筑物出现。
