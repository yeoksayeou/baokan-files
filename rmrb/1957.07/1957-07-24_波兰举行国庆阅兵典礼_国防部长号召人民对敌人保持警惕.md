Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 23rd: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the central military parade celebrating Poland's National Day was held in Poznan on July 22nd. Many cities, including Lublin, Szczecin, and Krakow, also held parades on the same day.

    On the reviewing stand at the military parade in Poznan were Polish United Workers' Party and state leaders such as Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz, representatives of leading bodies of various parties and groups, as well as Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and his entourage.

    Before the start of the military parade, Polish Defense Minister Spychalski delivered a holiday speech to the citizens of Poznan and Polish soldiers. He expressed his remembrance of the Polish, Soviet, and other countries' soldiers who participated in the anti-fascist war. He said, "We are convinced that the people's desire for peace will prevail. Our army has and can have no other goal than to defend the independence and borders of the motherland." He also emphasized that Poland hopes to cooperate in friendship with all countries. Poland and the German Democratic Republic have had many years of friendly cooperative relations, and the forces of peace and social progress in the Federal Republic of Germany will also prevail. However, as long as the forces of German militarism and border revisionism continue to threaten Poland's borders and independence, Poland cannot relax its vigilance and its preparations to defend the country and defend peace. As long as this threat exists, and as long as the world remains divided into hostile blocs, the Warsaw Pact is necessary to guarantee Poland's independence and unity and to ensure peace in Europe.

    After the national anthem was played and a salute was fired, the parade began. Leading the way were infantry units, students from various military academies, and the Poznan regional security corps, followed by mechanized units, engineers, artillery, and tank units. Finally, newly built supersonic fighter jets flew overhead. Throughout the parade, cheers erupted from the crowd.

    At the end of the military parade, the citizens of Poznan warmly cheered and paid tribute to the Polish party and government leaders and Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

    波兰举行国庆阅兵典礼
    国防部长号召人民对敌人保持警惕
    新华社华沙23日电　据波兰通讯社报道，庆祝波兰国庆节的中央阅兵典礼于7月22日在波兹南市举行。卢布林、什切青、克拉科夫等许多城市也在同一天举行了阅兵。
    在波兹南市举行的阅兵典礼检阅台上的有哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹等波兰统一工人党和国家领导人，各党派团体领导机构的代表，以及越南民主共和国主席胡志明和他的随行人员。
    波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基在阅兵典礼开始前向波兹南市民和波兰士兵发表了节日演说。他对曾经参加反法西斯战争的波兰、苏联和其他国家的战士表示怀念。他说，我们确信，人民群众要求和平的愿望将获胜。我们的军队除了保卫祖国的独立和边界以外，没有也不能有任何其他目标。他还强调说，波兰希望同一切国家友好合作。波兰和德意志民主共和国已经有了许多年的友好合作联系，德意志联邦共和国中的和平和社会进步力量也将获胜。但是只要德国军国主义和边界修正主义的势力还在威胁着波兰的边界和独立，波兰就不能放松警惕，放松保卫国家、保卫和平的准备。只要这种威胁还存在，只要世界还分裂成为敌对的集团，华沙条约就是保障波兰的独立和统一、保证欧洲和平所必需的。
    在奏国歌和鸣礼炮以后，阅兵分列式开始。走在前面的是步兵部队、各个军官学校的学员和波兹南地区保安团的队伍等，接着是机械化部队、工兵、炮兵和坦克部队，最后是新造的超音速歼击机从上空飞过。在阅兵进行当中，人群里不断发出欢呼声。
    在阅兵典礼结束的时候，波兹南市民向波兰党政领导人员和胡志明主席热情地欢呼致敬。
