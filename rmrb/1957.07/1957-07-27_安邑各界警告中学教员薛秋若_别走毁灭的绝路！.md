    An Yi Various Circles Warn Middle School Teacher Xue Qiuruo
    Don't Walk the Road to Destruction!
    (Our newspaper's report) Intellectuals and people from all walks of life in An Yi County, Shanxi Province, sternly criticize the reactionary remarks of rightist Xue Qiuruo. Xue Qiuruo is a Chinese language teacher at Yuncheng Middle School and a member of the China Democratic League.
    Xue Qiuruo slandered the Party as "excluding dissidents, employing people based on favoritism, being selfish, and listening only to one side." In the twelfth issue of "Shanxi League Newsletter," Xue Qiuruo published an article titled "Talking about Concerns." In this article, he described the socialist road as "seemingly a peaceful and prosperous era, with unified steps, but in reality, a road to destruction."
    Cadres from An Yi County's government offices, workers from the Yuncheng Salt Pond, railway workers, postal and telecommunications workers, welfare company employees, and farmers gathered to refute Xue Qiuruo's fallacy of "a road to destruction" by citing facts. Wang Kelin, a railway worker at Yuncheng Station, said angrily: "In the eight years since liberation, the country has built many huge factories, and the transportation industry has greatly developed. Railways and highways alone have been built for more than 10,000 kilometers, and the Yangtze River Bridge, unprecedented in history, has been opened to traffic. Rural areas have realized cooperation, and many agricultural cooperatives have begun to use tractors to cultivate the land. The lives of our workers and the working people across the country have improved compared to the past. Did these facts exist during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan? Xue Qiuruo, why do you say that socialism is a road to destruction?!"
    Teachers from Yuncheng Middle School also cited facts about the school's care for Xue Qiuruo and his father's work to refute his fallacy about the Party employing people based on favoritism.
    Now, Xue Qiuruo is at a loss for words in the face of the masses' unanimous rebuttal and is trying to cover up his anti-communist and anti-socialist essence, trying to exonerate himself in all aspects. The people from all walks of life in An Yi have stated that they will never stop until they achieve complete victory.

    安邑各界警告中学教员薛秋若
    别走毁灭的绝路！
    本报讯　山西省安邑县的知识分子和各界人民严厉批判右派分子薛秋若的反动言论。薛秋若是运城中学的语文教员、民盟成员。
    薛秋若诬蔑党“排斥异己，用人唯亲，自私自利，偏听偏信”。在“山西盟讯”第十二期上，薛秋若发表了一篇题为“谈顾虑”的文章。在这篇文章中，他把社会主义道路说成是“看起来太平盛世，统一步调的，实际是一条毁灭的绝路。”
    安邑县的机关干部、运城盐池工人、铁路工人、邮电工人、福利公司职工和农民集会，列举事实来批驳薛秋若的“一条毁灭的绝路”的谬论。运城车站铁路工人王克林愤怒地说：“解放八年来，国家建设了许多巨大的工厂，交通运输事业有了很大发展，光铁路、公路就修筑了一万余公里，自古未有的长江大桥通车了。农村实现了合作化，许多农业社已开始用拖拉机种地。我们工人和全国劳动人民的生活都比过去提高了。这些事实，在蒋介石、阎锡山统治时期有过吗？薛秋若你为什么说社会主义是一条毁灭的道路？！”
    运城中学的教师还列举学校照顾薛秋若和他的父亲的工作的事实，驳斥他关于党用人唯亲的谬论。
    现在，薛秋若在群众同声反驳的面前已理屈词穷，企图掩盖自己反共、反社会主义的实质，从各方面开脱自己。安邑各界人民表示，不获全胜，决不收兵。
