Pan Shu's Written Statement: Several Criticisms of the Two Education Ministries
It is necessary to value and utilize our country's experts; to improve the work of training teachers; to treat psychology as a science with a correct attitude; Party members who lead science must humbly learn.
　　
Because I am going abroad, I cannot attend this conference, but I still want to make a written statement. My statement mainly puts forward some criticisms of the two education ministries. The following opinions of mine are based on my own work.
　　
First, I believe that in the past few years, we have not made enough use of our own experts, nor have we paid enough attention to them. This has caused a lot of losses in our work, and at the same time, it has greatly hindered the exertion of the enthusiasm of our own experts. The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education have big problems in this regard. For example, in the formulation of the teaching plan for psychology majors, the Ministry of Higher Education did not solicit the opinions of domestic psychology experts. As a result, this teaching plan was formulated with many shortcomings. Regarding the methods of training psychology teachers, the Ministry of Education did not properly consult with its own experts. As a result, the methods adopted also have great problems. Since you don't understand enough yourself, why don't you ask others for more opinions? Some leading comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education even pretended to know what they did not know. For example, regarding the issue of psychology majors, a comrade from the Ministry of Higher Education said publicly that there are no psychology majors in Soviet comprehensive universities. Another comrade from the Ministry of Higher Education also said publicly when he went to Nanjing University for inspection that there should be no psychology majors in comprehensive universities. The former comrade was completely talking nonsense with his eyes closed. The latter comrade completely treated academic issues with his own subjectivity. Of course, we don't necessarily have to have what the Soviet Union has. We don't necessarily have to not have what the Soviet Union doesn't have. We must reason, we must study the problem carefully, and we must discuss it. The arrogant attitude of some leading comrades of the Ministry of Higher Education towards academic issues is embarrassing. Why not consult with relevant domestic experts but insist on being "self-opinionated"? Who is harmed? Isn't it the interests of your own work and national construction? I suggest that the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education should seriously examine the serious shortcomings of being "self-opinionated" and not respecting and utilizing their own experts in order to improve their work.
　　
Second, the Ministry of Education's work of training teachers needs to be improved. The Ministry of Education's leading ideology regarding normal education is essentially an ideology of training "teaching craftsmen." The most prominent manifestation of this leading ideology is still the training of psychology teachers. According to the Ministry of Education's method, people who study one or two psychology courses and lack training in basic science can serve as psychology teachers in normal schools and even normal colleges. It is surprising to see a science so easily and simply. And the effect is not satisfactory either. Psychology teachers trained in this way can generally only read from the textbook, and even reading from the textbook is very difficult. If this situation is not urgently improved, normal education will suffer great losses. The simple treatment of the problem of teacher training by the leading comrades of the Ministry of Education is essentially the same in other subjects, but only to a lesser degree. The leading comrades of the Ministry of Education regard normal education as if it is just a matter of big teaching craftsmen teaching small teaching craftsmen. For example, the Ministry of Education has always not attached importance to scientific research in normal colleges, and can even be said to have obliterated it. But it should be pointed out that this situation has improved. We welcome this improvement and hope that this improvement can continue.
　　
Third, the Ministry of Higher Education's learning from the Soviet Union has become mechanical and blind in many places. Still, in terms of psychology, because the Ministry of Higher Education blindly learned from the Soviet Union, it insisted on placing psychology majors in the philosophy department, which resulted in various difficulties for psychology majors in their work, and many obstacles to the improvement of teaching and the development of research in this science. Of course, psychology majors in the Soviet Union are placed in the philosophy department. But this is due to an old tradition, and there is no good reason for it. Therefore, the Soviet Union's method is actually outdated experience and cannot be regarded as any kind of advanced experience. However, the Ministry of Higher Education insisted on learning from outdated experience and easily abandoned our original and relatively correct method of separating psychology from philosophy.
　　
Fourth, the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education both have many scientific experts under their systems, but they do not make good use of their valuable strength. We know that most of China's scientists are in universities, but the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education seem to not know how to cherish this "golden rice bowl." The Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education are both complaining that the Academy of Sciences is pulling people too hard, resulting in a "people's hearts towards the Academy" situation. But this "people's hearts towards the Academy" situation is partly due to the Academy of Sciences' pulling, but I think it is mainly because the two education ministries are doing the work of pushing and sending people away in an invisible way. Because if you hold a "golden rice bowl" and only use it to eat or even to beg for food, the "golden rice bowl" will feel very wronged. For example, I and the original psychology teachers of Nanjing University were pushed and sent by the Ministry of Higher Education as gifts or burdens to the Academy of Sciences. To be fair, the Academy of Sciences did not pull us, and we did not "yearn" for the Academy of Sciences. Now, the two education ministries, especially the Ministry of Higher Education, only know how to blame the Academy of Sciences for pulling people, but do not think about how to treat the large number of scientific talents under their own systems. Doesn't this indicate a lack of clarity in their understanding of things? The preparatory work for the Institute of Educational Science is progressing very slowly, especially regarding the educational psychology group, there is no progress. It is said that there are difficulties in transferring people. I think it is still due to a lack of determination. This lack of determination is probably another manifestation of the leading comrades of the Ministry of Education not attaching enough importance to scientific research and not appreciating the importance of giving full play to the strength of their own experts. Under the system of the Ministry of Education, many psychology experts have not been able to exert their expertise, some are not used properly, and some are almost idle. Why is this? The leading comrades of the two education ministries must realize that reserving a large number of scientific experts without trying to give full play to their strength, causing incalculable losses to China's socialist construction and the development of science and technology, in essence, cannot but constitute a serious criminal act.

Fifth, in terms of the discipline of psychology alone, the various measures taken by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education in the past were inappropriate, and even very wrong. The basic reason for this phenomenon is that the two education ministries do not have enough understanding of this discipline and their attitude is not correct. We earnestly hope that the two education ministries can correctly understand this discipline and have a correct attitude in the future. Whether their understanding in leadership positions is correct and whether their attitude is correct has a significant impact.

The last opinion is about the leadership of science or higher education. Can the Party lead science? It should be affirmed that "yes." And the entire scientific enterprise must be steered by the Party. But can Party member comrades lead science? That depends on the specific situation. Some comrades lead very well; some comrades do not lead so competently; and some comrades lead very poorly, causing many mistakes and losses. The main key is whether they can humbly learn and whether they persist in their own "self-opinionatedness." If they do not know enough themselves and do not humbly learn or persist in their own "self-opinionatedness," then they will not lead well or will cause great losses to their work and make serious mistakes. Some comrades were originally not very competent in scientific leadership work, but later they were not bad. Some comrades were originally not very competent, but later they did not see any progress. The reason lies in this. Of course, this is the same for non-Party leaders. People who lead scientific work do not necessarily have to become experts in several sciences or one science. The problem is whether they can connect well with scientists, listen more to the opinions of scientists, and consult with them more. I feel that some leading comrades of the two education ministries have not done enough in this regard and need to be properly corrected. To correct this shortcoming, first of all, it is necessary to go deep into the grassroots level and learn more about the situation and opinions below.

Please give your opinions on the above opinions to all the representatives, and please consider them to the leading comrades of the two education ministries.

    潘菽的书面发言：对两个教育部的几点批评
    要看重并利用我国的专家；要改进培养师资的工作；要以正确态度对待心理学这门科学；领导科学的党员要虚心学习
    我因出国，不能出席此次大会，但仍要作一次书面发言。我的发言主要是对两个教育部提几点批评的意见。我以下的意见是结合着自己的业务来提的。
    首先，我认为，几年来我们对于自己的专家利用不够，重视不够。这就使我们在工作上造成不少损失，同时也大大地妨害了自己的专家们的积极性的发挥。高教部和教育部在这方面的毛病是很大的。例如，关于心理学专业教学计划的拟订，高教部并没有征求国内心理学专家的意见。结果，这个教学计划订得缺点很多。关于心理学师资培养的办法，教育部也没有好好和自己的专家商量商量。结果，所采用的办法也有很大的毛病。自己既然了解不够，为什么不向别人多征求征求意见呢？高教部的某些领导同志还强不知以为知。例如，关于心理学专业的问题，高教部曾有一位同志在公开的场合说，苏联的综合大学中没有心理学专业。高教部的另一位同志到南京大学去视察的时候也在公开的场合说，综合大学内不应该有心理学专业。前一位同志是完全闭着眼睛乱说。后一位同志则完全以自己的主观来对待学术上的问题。自然，苏联有的，我们不一定要有。苏联没有的，我们也不一定非没有不可。我们要讲道理，要把问题好好研究研究，讨论讨论。高教部某些领导同志那种对待学术问题的蛮横态度是令人难堪的。为什么不和国内有关的专家们商量商量而一定要“师心自用”呢？遭受到损害的是谁呢？还不是自己的工作和国家建设的利益吗？我建议高教部和教育部对于“师心自用”，不尊重并利用自己的专家这个严重的缺点应该认真检查检查以改进工作。
    其次，教育部培养师资的工作需要改进。教育部关于师范教育的领导思想实质上是一种培养“教书匠”的思想。这种领导思想最突出的一种表现还是关于心理学师资的培养。照教育部的办法，学习一两门心理学而对于基础科学又缺乏训练的人就可以担任师范学校甚至师范学院的心理学师资。把一门科学看得如此轻易简单，实在令人惊异。而效果呢，也并不是令人满意的。这样培养出来的心理学师资，一般只能照本宣读，甚至照本宣读还有很大困难。这种情况假如不急谋改进，师范教育会受到很大的损失。教育部的领导同志们简单对待培养师资问题的表现在其他学科方面在本质上也是一样的，不过程度上较好一些而已。教育部的领导同志们把师范教育看成仿佛只是大教书匠教出小教书匠。例如，教育部对于师范学院的科学研究是一向很不重视的，甚至可以说是予以抹杀的。但应该指出，这种情况已有好转。我们欢迎这种好转，并且希望这种好转能一直继续下去。
    第三，高教部的学习苏联有许多地方变成了机械地、盲目地学习。仍旧就心理学来说，高教部因为盲目地学习苏联，硬把心理学专业摆在哲学系里，结果是使心理学专业在工作上遭遇到种种困难，使这门科学的教学工作的改进和研究工作的开展受到许多障碍。固然，苏联的心理学专业是摆在哲学系里的。但这是由于古老的传统，并没有很好的理由。所以苏联的那种办法其实已经是陈旧的经验，并不能算是何种先进的经验。但高教部硬要照学陈旧的经验而轻易抛弃我们原来的把心理学和哲学分开那种比较正确的办法。
    第四，高教部和教育部在自己的系统之下都有很多科学专家，但不去好好发挥他们可宝贵的力量。我们知道，中国大多数的科学家都是在高等学校中，但高教部和教育部捧着这只“金饭碗”都好像不知爱惜。高教部和教育部都在埋怨科学院拉人拉得太厉害以至造成“人心向院”的局势。但这种“人心向院”的局势固然一部分是由于科学院的拉，但我看主要还是由于两个教育部在无形中做着推和送的工作。因为捧着“金饭碗”而只用来吃饭或者甚至去讨饭，“金饭碗”是会感觉到很大的冤屈的。例如我和原来南京大学全体心理学教师，就是高教部把我们当作礼物或者包袱一样半推半送送给科学院的。应该讲公道话，科学院并没有拉我们，我们也并没有对科学院“心向往之”。现在，两个教育部，特别是高教部，只知一味责怪科学院的拉人而不自己想想在怎样对待自己系统之下的大量科学人材。这不是表示自己对事理的认识不清吗？教育科学研究所的筹备工作进行得很慢，特别关于教育心理组还不见什么进展。据说，调人有困难。我看，还是由于决心不够。这种决心不够恐怕又是教育部的领导同志对科学研究重视不够和对发挥自己专家的力量的重要性体会不够的表现。在教育部的系统下，有不少位心理学专家并没有发挥他们的专长，有的使用并不得当，有的还几乎是闲散着。这究竟是为什么呢？两个教育部的领导同志们要了解到，储备着大量的科学专家而不设法去充分发挥他们的力量，使我国的社会主义建设和科学技术的发展受到难以估计的损失，这在实质上不能不构成一种严重的犯罪行为。
    第五，单就心理学这门学科说，高教部和教育部过去的种种措施是不妥当的，甚至是十分错误的。所以有这种现象，基本上还是由于两个教育部对这门学科的认识很不够，态度很不端正。我们恳切地盼望两个教育部今后对这门学科的认识能正确起来，态度能端正起来。他们在领导地位的认识正确不正确，态度端正不端正，所产生的影响是不小的。
    最后一个意见是关于科学或高等教育的领导问题。党能不能领导科学呢？应该肯定地说“能够的”。并且关于全部的科学事业也非由党来掌舵不可。但党员同志们能不能领导科学呢？那要看具体情况。有些同志领导得很好；有些同志则领导得不那样胜任；还有些同志则领导得很差以致造成不少错误和损失。主要的关键在于能不能虚心学习，是不是坚持自己的“师心自用”。自己知道得不够而又不虚心学习或者坚持自己的“师心自用”，那就不会领导得好或者会使工作受到很大的损失，犯下严重的错误。有些同志对于科学领导工作原来不很胜任，但后来就不差了。有些同志则原来固然不很胜任，但后来也并不见进步。其中原因就在此。当然，这对非党员的领导同志来说也是一样的。领导科学工作的人不一定要对于几门科学或者一门科学变成行家。问题在于能不能很好地联系科学家，多听听科学家的意见，多和他们商量商量。我觉得两个教育部的有些领导同志们在这方面做得很不够，须要好好纠正。要纠正这个缺点，首先要深入下层，多多了解下面的情况和意见。
    以上意见请全体代表同志们指教，并请两个教育部的领导同志们考虑。
