    A Small Factory of Five People
    Wu Rongjiang
    The Huanqiu (Globe) Ink Factory in Bengbu is a small factory with only five people.
    The first time I walked into this ink factory, I saw packaged wooden crates almost touching the ceiling. The room was so crowded that there was only a narrow path for pedestrians. I couldn't help but doubt the sales of Huanqiu brand ink. Otherwise, why would a factory with only a few people producing ink have so many products that hadn't been sold? When I met the factory director, I asked about the sales issue. Factory Director Jia Jianzhang replied: The results of the national ink appraisal show that the quality of Huanqiu brand ink exceeds that of ordinary ink on the market. Now we only worry about the production being too low; demand exceeded supply in the first half of this year. These inks in the factory already have customers; they are just waiting for the ship to set sail.
    The Huanqiu Ink Factory has more than a dozen small rooms, divided into production rooms, packaging rooms, bottle washing rooms, and two small offices. The offices are also filled with ink bottles. One room also has a bed, used as a bench during the day and for sleeping at night. The entire factory has only two desks and four chairs, all old. All the equipment is also very simple.
    The factory is so simple that our topic naturally turned to running the factory diligently and thriftily.
    1954 was the first year of the Huanqiu Ink Factory's operation, and also the most difficult year. All five hundred yuan of capital was used to buy raw materials and auxiliary materials. Because of the small amount of capital, they could only sell ink in small quantities, mainly serving elementary school students. All the work of the factory was done by Jia Jianzhang and the current accountant Feng Dixiang. One person sold at home, and the other went out to promote sales. Because they paid attention to quality and the price of the product was cheap, sales gradually opened up. The loans and other assistance provided by the state, especially the investment of 5,000 yuan last year, played a significant role in the development of this factory.
    This year, in addition to the five full-time employees, Huanqiu Ink Factory also employs about ten temporary female workers when it is busy. The factory has developed, but they still maintain the characteristics of the past, not pursuing immediate improvement of life, and not paying attention to decorating the factory facade. From the factory director to the workers, everyone does the work of several people.
    While we were talking, a person from a construction company came to find the factory director. After Jia Jianzhang dealt with the matter and turned back, he said: This company has a batch of waste materials to sell as firewood. In the past, we used good wood for the wooden boxes for holding ink. Later, we negotiated with them to process wooden boxes using their waste materials. Now the first batch of four thousand two hundred wooden boxes has been made. According to our calculations, each wooden box is four jiao cheaper than before, saving a total of one thousand six hundred and eighty yuan.
    Jia Jianzhang took me to visit the bottle washing room. There, temporary female workers were scrubbing old ink bottles purchased from various places. The use of these old bottles reduces the cost of ink bottles by one-third.
    Although this factory is very simple, it also tries its best to take care of the lives of its employees. Once, a female worker suggested buying a straw hat for Xing Yuankai, who pushed the water cart. The factory accepted this suggestion; because it was inconvenient to push the cart with an umbrella on rainy days, they also bought him a raincoat. However, they didn't just go to the department store to buy it, but went to the second-hand store. The factory director ran to many second-hand markets to buy the raincoat, and finally bought a raincoat that was of good quality but half the price.
    Due to diligent and thrifty production, the cost of this factory has gradually decreased. In the first year of operation, the cost of producing every hundred kilograms of ink was ninety yuan. In the first half of last year, it dropped to eighty-one yuan and eight jiao, and in May of this year, it dropped further to fifty-six yuan.
    This small factory has always maintained a hardworking and simple style in its production and development. The profits in recent years have increased several times more than the invested capital, and it has handed over more than 5,000 yuan of profit to the state in a little over a year.
    Why can the Huanqiu Ink Factory make so much profit? In the words of Factory Director Jia Jianzhang, it is to run the factory with the spirit of managing a household.

    五个人的小厂
    吴荣江
    蚌埠市的环球墨水厂是一个只有五个人的小工厂。
    我第一次走进这个墨水厂的时候，看到包装好的木箱快要碰到天花板，屋里挤得只有一条很窄的行人道。我不禁怀疑起环球牌墨水的销路，不然，为什么只有几个人生产的工厂，会有这么多产品没有销出去呢？见到厂长，我就问起销路问题。厂长贾鉴章回答说：全国墨水鉴定的结果，环球牌墨水的质量超过了市场上一般的墨水。现在只嫌产量太少，今年上半年还供不应求呢。厂里这些墨水早已有了顾主，只是在等船启运。
    环球墨水厂有十几间小房子，分生产间，包装间，洗瓶间，还有两小间办公室。办公室里也堆满了墨水瓶，有一间里面还放了一张床，白天当板凳，晚上睡人。全厂只有两张办公桌，四张椅子，都是旧的，一切用具也很简陋。
    工厂是这样简朴，我们的话题很自然地转到勤俭办厂上。
    1954年，是环球墨水厂开办的第一年，也是最困难的一年。五百元资金全都买了原料和辅助材料。因为资金少，只能做些墨水零卖，服务对象主要是小学生。全厂工作由贾鉴章和现在的会计凤迪祥二人担任。一个人在家里卖，一个人就出去推销。因为他们注意质量和产品价钱便宜，销路逐渐打开了。国家给予的贷款等帮助，特别是去年投资五千元，对这个厂的发展起了很大作用。
    今年，环球墨水厂除了有五个正式人员以外，忙的时候还用十个左右临时女工。工厂发展了，但是他们还保持着过去的特点，不追求立刻改善生活，不讲究装璜工厂门面。从厂长到工人，都是一个人做几个人的工作。
    我们谈话的时候，一个建筑公司的人来找厂长。贾鉴章接洽事情后转回来说：这个公司有一批废料当劈柴卖，我们装墨水的木箱过去都用好木材。后来我们两家就商量着用他们的废料加工木箱。现在已做好第一批四千二百个木箱。据我们计算，每个木箱比过去便宜了四角钱，共节约了一千六百八十元。
    贾鉴章带我参观了洗瓶间。那里，临时女工正在擦洗从各地收购来的旧墨水瓶。利用这些旧瓶，使墨水瓶成本降低了三分之一。
    这个厂虽然很简朴，但是对职工生活也尽量加以照顾。有一次，一个女工建议给推水工人邢源恺买一顶草帽，厂里接受了这个建议；因为雨天打伞推水不方便，还给他买了一件雨衣。不过，他们不是说买就到百货商店，而是到旧货店去。厂长为了买雨衣，曾跑了许多旧货场，终于买了一件质量很好、但是价格便宜一半的雨衣。
    由于勤俭生产，这个厂的成本逐渐降低。办厂第一年，生产每百公斤墨水成本费是九十元，去年上半年降到八十一元八角，今年5月份又下降到五十六元。
    这个小小的工厂，在生产发展中一直保持着勤劳朴素的作风。几年来的盈利比投资资金增加了几倍，而且在一年多点期间给国家上缴了五千多元的利润。
    环球墨水厂为什么能盈余这么多钱呢？以贾鉴章厂长的话说，就是用过家庭日子的精神办工厂。
