    Thanking the Nation for Support, Determined to Overcome the Flood
    People of Cangshan Write to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
    To the CPC Central Committee and the State Council:
    From July 11th to 15th, our county experienced continuous heavy rains and torrential downpours, with rainfall reaching 300 millimeters. Mountain floods erupted, and river waters surged. The Yi River reached a flow rate of 11,800 cubic meters per second, and medium and small rivers overflowed and breached their banks, causing widespread flooding. This year's water level is the highest in recorded history. 350,000 people were affected by the disaster, with 800,000 mu of land inundated. Just as the people in the disaster area were facing an extremely dangerous moment, the Central People's Government dispatched life-saving airplanes at 2:00 PM on the 17th, airdropping large quantities of life jackets, lifebuoys, life rafts, and other supplies. All 630,000 people in the county witnessed these life-saving supplies and were filled with joy and excitement, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "The people's airplanes have arrived!" Cheers and applause spread everywhere. Originally, people were in a state of great worry and anxiety, their moods very somber. The airdrop was like sunshine, warming the hearts of the people throughout the county and boosting their confidence and determination to overcome the flood. We sincerely thank the Central Government for its strong support and concern. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party and higher-level governments, to actively and diligently do our work, use practical actions to lead the people of the county to overcome all difficulties, conquer the flood, make every effort to ensure a good autumn harvest, and do our utmost to support national industrial construction. On behalf of the people of the entire county, we extend our highest respects to you!

    感谢国家支援，决心战胜水患
    苍山人民上书中共中央和国务院
    中共中央和国务院：
    自7月11日起至15日止，我县连降大雨、暴雨，降雨量达三百公厘。山洪暴发，河水猛涨。沂河水位达一万一千八百个流量，中、小河流普遍漫溢、决口，泛滥成灾。今年水位之高是历史上从所未有的。受灾群众达三十五万人，上水面积八十万亩。正当灾区群众陷于十二分危险的千钧一发之际，中央人民政府在17日下午二时派来了救命的飞机，空投了大批的救生衣、救生圈、救生袋等物资。全县六十三万人民目睹着救生物资，无不欢欣鼓舞，大家高呼“毛主席万岁”“人民的飞机来了”。到处传遍欢呼声、鼓掌声。原来人们陷入万分的忧虑和焦急之中，心情十分阴沉。飞机空投像阳光一样，温暖着全县人民的心，鼓舞起全县人民战胜水灾的信心和决心。我们衷心感谢中央对我们的大力支持和关怀，我们决心在党和上级政府的领导下，积极努力作好工作，用实际行动领导全县人民克服一切困难，战胜水患；想尽千方百计，搞好秋季生产，争取秋季丰收，尽最大努力支援国家工业建设。我们代表全县人民向你们致以崇高敬礼！
