    The *Wenyi Bao* Editorial Department Launches a Struggle Against Rightist Ideology

    The struggle revolves around three fundamental questions:
    1.  Should we follow the path of *Wenhui Bao*? 2. Is the leadership of the Party necessary? 3. Should the 1954 conclusions be overturned?

    (Report from Our Newspaper) Since June 24th, *Wenyi Bao* has held five general staff meetings to combat the rightist thinking within the editorial department. The leaders of the editorial department have also, with a spirit of serious self-criticism, examined the *Wenyi Bao* issues published since the seventh issue.

    The meetings revealed that during the initial stage of the rectification campaign, when bourgeois rightists in society were rabidly attacking the Party, those with rightist ideas in the *Wenyi Bao* editorial department also launched a fierce battle against the Party's leadership in literary and art circles. The main figures were Tang Yin, director of the *Wenyi Bao* Editorial Office, and Tang Dacheng, deputy director. They took advantage of the absence of Deputy Editors-in-Chief Hou Jinjing and Chen Xiaoyu due to official business, and exploited the right-leaning sentiments of some staff members of the editorial department to stir up this struggle. Xiao Qian, another Deputy Editor-in-Chief of *Wenyi Bao*, also used his position as the duty officer in charge of the Editorial Office to smuggle poisonous weeds into *Wenyi Bao* and obstruct their removal.

    Whether *Wenyi Bao* should follow the path of *Wenhui Bao*, whether the Party's leadership is necessary, and whether the Central Propaganda Department's 1954 conclusions and resolutions on examining the errors of *Wenyi Bao* should be overturned – these three questions are the focus of this struggle. At the meetings, Editor-in-Chief Zhang Guangnian and Deputy Editors-in-Chief Hou Jinjing and Chen Xiaoyu, based on a series of facts that had been exposed, pointed out that there were serious differences between them and Tang Yin and others on these fundamental questions.

    Should *Wenyi Bao* follow the path of *Wenhui Bao*? In the previous period, this question caused great turbulence among many editors of *Wenyi Bao*. They were attracted and controlled by the bourgeois direction of *Wenhui Bao*. Some wanted *Wenyi Bao* to compete with *Wenhui Bao*; some advocated merging *Wenyi Bao* with *Wenhui Bao*; some wanted to become reporters for *Wenhui Bao*, others wanted to be editors; some offered ideas or revised drafts for *Wenhui Bao* commentators; Tang Yin and Tang Dacheng contacted people from *Wenhui Bao*, wanting to start a literary criticism supplement in *Wenhui Bao*; some said *Wenyi Bao* represented the "officialdom," while *Wenhui Bao* represented the "masses"; Tang Yin said that the Chinese Writers Association "is a派出所 (police station) of the Central Propaganda Department," and *Wenyi Bao* is "the bulletin board of the 派出所." In short, these people admired and applauded *Wenhui Bao*'s method of setting fires everywhere, believing that only *Wenhui Bao* was doing a good job. During this time, *Wenhui Bao*'s Beijing-based reporters frequently visited the *Wenyi Bao* editorial department, adding fuel to the fire. Even after the *People's Daily* criticized *Wenhui Bao*'s bourgeois direction, some still criticized the *People's Daily*'s criticism as "unconvincing," and tried their best to defend *Wenhui Bao*'s bourgeois direction.

    The question of whether or not to follow the path of *Wenhui Bao* is closely linked to the question of whether or not the Party's leadership is necessary. It was revealed at the meetings that Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others, despite being Party members, held serious antagonistic feelings toward the Party's leadership and tried their best to get rid of the Party's leadership. Tang Yin repeatedly said at and outside the meetings that he and the leading comrades "had no common language"; Tang Dacheng said: "I can no longer blindly follow the leadership." Due to their serious antagonism, the *Wenyi Bao* editorial department was shrouded in an extremely abnormal atmosphere in the early stages of the rectification campaign, with a sense that something was about to explode. Disregarding the facts, Tang Yin insisted that some responsible comrades from the Central Propaganda Department, the Party Group of the Writers Association, and even the Editorial Board of *Wenyi Bao* were "resisting the Central policy" and were resistant to the "大鸣大放" (da ming da fang - "great airing of views"). His "evidence" was that Editor-in-Chief Zhang Guangnian did not approve of publishing articles written by Tang Yin and others that launched personal attacks against certain responsible comrades of the Party. What exactly was the "大鸣大放" in the minds of Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, etc.? It goes without saying that they wanted to turn *Wenyi Bao* into a bourgeois-style "free forum," similar in nature to *Wenhui Bao* in the previous period. In order to get rid of the Party's leadership, Tang Yin and Tang Dacheng, in addition to planning to start a literary criticism supplement in *Wenhui Bao*, also tried to recruit people to start another literary criticism publication, wanting to seize the opportunity to withdraw from *Wenyi Bao*. Deputy Editor-in-Chief Hou Jinjing refused Tang Yin's request to start a coterie publication and exposed their wrongdoing. Deputy Editor-in-Chief Chen Xiaoyu, in the early stages of the rectification campaign, reminded the editorial department not to commit right-leaning opportunist errors, which aroused great dissatisfaction from Tang Yin and others. At the meetings, someone suggested that the reason why *Wenyi Bao* was not doing well was because "the editors have to listen to the group leaders, the group leaders have to listen to the department directors, and the department directors have to listen to the editorial board." Tang Dacheng said: "Now that we are rectifying the Writers Association, do we still have to be led by him?" When this sentiment of not wanting the Party's leadership reached its peak, the *Wenyi Bao* editorial department saw instances of not sending the final proofs of the publication to the Editor-in-Chief for review.

    Regarding the Central Propaganda Department's 1954 conclusion on the errors committed by *Wenyi Bao* and the decisions of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association on the errors of *Wenyi Bao*, Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others believed that they were fundamentally untenable. Tang Yin refuted the conclusion item by item at the meetings, attempting to overturn the conclusion completely. He also said that the Party's "examination of *Wenyi Bao* started from concepts," that it was "putting on the hat first and then looking for examples to fill it." He believed that in the past, *Wenyi Bao* had not only not surrendered to bourgeois ideology, but that its spearhead "was mainly directed at bourgeois ideology," and that it had advocated cultivating new forces. Therefore, the conclusions of "surrendering to bourgeois ideology" and "suppressing new forces" were, in their view, all fabricated.

    The meetings began to expose and criticize Deputy Editor-in-Chief Xiao Qian's behavior of using his position to smuggle poisonous weeds and use *Wenyi Bao* as a weapon to attack the Party. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Xiao Qian not only wrote articles in *Wenhui Bao* himself, saying that publishing work was "worse than before," and published "It's easy to deal with people you know" in *Wenyi Bao* under a pseudonym, launching an attack on the People's Literature Publishing House, but also encouraged a large group of people, including Zhang Yousong and Wang Chongwen, to write articles (some of which were not published) to concentrate their attacks on the People's Literature Publishing House. At the meetings, everyone also criticized the erroneous views in Xiao Qian's article "Relaxation, Tolerance, Personnel Work," published in the *People's Daily*. The China Democratic League branch of the Writers Association has also begun to criticize Xiao Qian's rightist ideas.

    Zhang Guangnian, Editor-in-Chief of *Wenyi Bao*, also made a self-examination speech on behalf of Deputy Editors-in-Chief Hou Jinjing and Chen Xiaoyu regarding the previous period of *Wenyi Bao* (the full text can be found on page five of this newspaper). He pointed out that *Wenyi Bao* published nearly two hundred articles of various sizes during the rectification campaign, many of which were good articles. However, *Wenyi Bao* also published some things that were no different from the poisonous weeds in *Wenhui Bao*, including articles with rightist ideas, sensational reports, and short articles launching personal attacks. He said that some poisonous weeds were released consciously, prepared for criticism; the deep harm of some poisonous weeds was not recognized in time, and they were not refuted in time; some were made with compromises and concessions that should not have been made under the pressure of rightist ideas and right-leaning sentiments in the editorial department. Zhang Guangnian said: On these issues, it is essentially a shameful surrender to bourgeois ideology! He made a serious self-criticism of this serious mistake.

### 扭转文艺报的资产阶级倾向

    扭转文艺报的资产阶级倾向
    文艺报编辑部展开反右派思想斗争
    斗争围绕着三个原则问题：
    一、走不走文汇报的道路？二、要不要党的领导？三、该不该推翻一九五四年的结论？
    本报讯：文艺报自6月24日以来，曾陆续召开了五次全体工作人员大会，对编辑部的右派思想展开斗争；编辑部领导人并以严肃的自我批评精神，对第七期以后的文艺报做了检查。
    大会揭露：整风初期，正当社会上资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，文艺报编辑部具有右派思想的人，也曾对文艺界党的领导，挑起了一场激战。其中的主脑人是文艺报总编室主任唐因和副主任唐达成。他们利用副总编辑侯金镜、陈笑雨因公出差的时候，利用编辑部一些工作人员的右倾情绪，煽起了这场斗争。文艺报副总编辑萧乾，也利用他正在值班掌管总编室工作的机会，向文艺报偷运毒草，并阻挠锄掉毒草。
    文艺报要不要走文汇报的道路？要不要党的领导？应不应该推翻中央宣传部1954年关于检查文艺报错误的结论和决议？这三个问题，是这次斗争的焦点。会上，总编辑张光年、副总编辑侯金镜和陈笑雨，根据已经暴露的一系列事实，指出他们和唐因等人之间，在这些原则问题上有严重的分歧。
    文艺报要不要走文汇报的道路？前一个时候，这个问题在文艺报编辑部不少编辑人员中曾发生很大波动，他们被文汇报的资产阶级方向所吸引、支配。有些人想要文艺报和文汇报赛跑；有人主张文艺报和文汇报合并；有人要去文汇报做记者，有人要去做编辑；有人替文汇报评论员出主意或修改稿子；唐因、唐达成和文汇报的人接头，想在文汇报上办一个文学评论副刊；有人说文艺报代表“官方”，文汇报代表“群众”；唐因说中国作家协会“是中宣部的派出所”，文艺报是“派出所的布告牌”。总之，这些人对文汇报到处点火的办法倾慕、喝采，认为只有文汇报搞得好。就在这个时候，文汇报的驻京记者经常在文艺报编辑部串进串出，火上加油。直到人民日报对文汇报的资产阶级方向提出批评后，还有人指责人民日报的批评“没有说服力”，极力为文汇报的资产阶级方向辩护。
    要不要走文汇报的道路问题是和要不要党的领导紧密相连的。会上揭露：唐因、唐达成等人身为党员，却对党的领导抱有严重对抗情绪，并极力想摆脱党的领导。唐因在会上会下一再说，他和领导同志之间“没有共同语言”；唐达成说：“我再不能盲目地跟领导走了。”由于他们的严重对抗情绪，在整风初期，文艺报编辑部曾笼罩着一种极不正常的气氛，大有箭在弦上一触即发之势。唐因不顾事实，一口咬定说：从中宣部的某些负责同志、作家协会党组、直到文艺报编委会，都“抗拒中央的方针”，对大鸣大放有抵触。他的“证据”是：总编辑张光年不赞成发表唐因等人写的对某些党的负责同志进行人身攻击的文章。究竟唐因、唐达成等心目中的大鸣大放是什么呢？不言而喻，那是想把文艺报办成资产阶级式的“自由论坛”，其性质和前一时期的文汇报差不多。唐因、唐达成为了摆脱党的领导，除打算在文汇报上办一个文学评论副刊外，还曾活动拉人，计划另办一个文学评论刊物，想伺机退出文艺报。副总编辑侯金镜拒绝了唐因拉他办同人刊物的要求，并揭发了他们的错误行为，副总编辑陈笑雨在整风初期，曾提醒编辑部不要犯右倾机会主义的错误，却引起唐因等人很大不满。在会上，有人提出文艺报所以办不好，是因为“编辑要听组长的话，组长要听部主任的话，部主任要听编委的话”。唐达成说：“现在整作家协会的风，难道还要受他的领导吗？”当这种不要党的领导的情绪达到高峰时，文艺报编辑部便出现了不送刊物大样给总编辑看的事情。
    关于中央宣传部1954年对文艺报所犯错误的结论和文联、作协关于文艺报错误的决议，唐因、唐达成等人认为那是根本不能成立的。唐因在会上对结论逐条加以批驳，企图一古脑儿把结论推翻。并说，党“检查文艺报是从概念出发的”，是“先有帽子再去找事例填”的。他认为过去文艺报非但没有向资产阶级思想投降，而且它的矛头“主要是指向资产阶级思想的”，并提倡过培养新生力量，所以“向资产阶级思想投降”、“压制新生力量”等结论，在他们看来都是无中生有的东西。
    大会开始揭发和批判副总编辑萧乾利用职权偷运毒草，并把文艺报当作向党进攻的武器的行为。在整风开始的时候，萧乾不但自己在文汇报上写文章说出版工作“今不如昔”，化名在文艺报发表“自己人都好办”，向人民文学出版社开火，而且还鼓动张友松、王崇文等一大批人写文章（有些文章没有发表），对人民文学出版社集中火力攻击。会上，大家并对萧乾在人民日报上发表的“放心·容忍·人事工作”一文中的错误观点进行了批判。作协民盟支部也已开始对萧乾的右派思想进行批判。
    文艺报总编辑张光年并代表副总编辑侯金镜、陈笑雨对前一时期的文艺报，做了检查发言（全文见本报五版）。他指出：文艺报在整风期间，共发表了大大小小近两百篇文章，其中许多是好文章。但文艺报也发表了一些和文汇报上的毒草不相上下的东西，其中包括有右派思想的文章、煽动性的报道和进行人身攻击的短文。他说，有些毒草是有意识地放出，准备批驳的；对有些毒草却没有及时认清它的毒害之深，没有及时反驳；有的是在编辑部右派思想和右倾情绪的压力下，做了不应该有的妥协和让步。张光年说：在这些问题上，实质上是对资产阶级思想的可耻投降！他对这一严重错误做了认真的自我批评。
