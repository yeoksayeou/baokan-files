    Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 19th: Azahari, Chairman of the Brunei People's Party, who recently visited Singapore, told the Singapore press on July 16th that his party had submitted a constitutional memorandum to the British Colonial Secretary through the Brunei British Resident two weeks ago, requesting negotiations on Brunei's autonomy.
    Brunei is located in North Borneo and is a sultanate under British colonial rule. The British established a legislative council in Brunei, but all of its members are appointed by the government. It is reported that the People's Party, which is demanding autonomy, has 16,000 members out of Brunei's 66,000 residents.
    Azahari said that the People's Party would absolutely safeguard the original rights of the Sultan and the British. It only requested that 75% of the members of the Legislative Council be elected by the people, that is, 27 of the 36 members be elected by the people, and the remaining 9 be appointed by the Sultan. The party also demanded the implementation of a multilingual system in the Legislative Council, allowing members to use English, Chinese, and Malay.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th: The British House of Commons passed the bill stipulating the establishment of the Federation of Malaya as an independent and autonomous country within the British Commonwealth in the third reading on the 19th. According to this bill, Malaya will become independent on August 31st.
    This bill will become law after being passed by the House of Lords and approved by the King.

    文莱人民党要求文莱自治
    英下院三读通过马来亚独立法案
    据新华社19日讯　新加坡消息：最近访问新加坡的文莱人民党主席阿扎哈里在7月16日对新加坡报界说，他的党已经在两个星期以前通过文莱英国参政司向英国殖民地大臣呈递一份宪制备忘录，要求举行关于文莱自治的谈判。
    文莱在北婆罗洲，是在英国殖民统治下的一个土邦。英国在文莱设立了一个立法议会，但是它的全部议员都是由官方委任的。据报道，要求自治的人民党在文莱六万六千名居民中拥有一万六千名党员。
    阿扎哈里说，人民党将绝对维护苏丹和英国人原有的权利，它只是要求75％的议员由人民选举，即在三十六名议员中，有二十七名由人民选举，其余九名由苏丹委任。这个党还要求在立法议会中实现多种语言制，准许议员使用英语、华语和马来语三种语言。
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：英国下院19日三读通过了一项规定建立马来亚联合邦为英联邦内独立自主国家的法案。根据这个法案，马来亚将在8月31日独立。
    这个法案经过上院通过和英王批准后将成为法律。
