To the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party:

On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, we extend our warm, fraternal congratulations to you, and through you, to all comrades of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people.

For the past thirty-five years, the Japanese Communist Party has waged a heroic struggle against Japanese militarism and in defense of peace in the Far East. Now, the Japanese Communist Party is waging an indomitable struggle to defend Japan's independence, peace, and democracy. The history of the past thirty-five years proves that the Japanese Communist Party has consistently been loyal to the interests of the Japanese people and deserves to be called the outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese nation.

We wish the Japanese Communist Party unity, overcoming all difficulties, and achieving new successes in the struggle to win complete national independence, to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to safeguard democracy and the rights of the people.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
