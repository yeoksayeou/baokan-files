Listen to Zhang Bojun's wild remarks:
    "I said I wanted to compete with the Communist Party for the world!"
    Yan Xinmin, Member of the Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: Zhang Bojun's so-called self-criticisms within the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the past few days show how dishonest he still is today. In order to explain everyone's criticism of his consistent anti-communism, he started from the beginning. But in the entire three and a half days of speeches, no trace of anti-communism could be found. On the contrary, it was his consistent revolutionary nature. Zhang Bojun also admitted that he was a double-dealer. But all the speeches expressed only one side, only the false, insincere side, not the true, contrary side. In order to remind Zhang Bojun, I will write down the following points, even if they are incomplete:
      Zhang Bojun is considered the heir to the political legacy of the revolutionary martyr Mr. Deng Yanda. So how did Deng Yanda view him during his lifetime? According to Bojun himself, "Mr. Deng trusted Ji Fang and did not trust me. He never let me know where he lived." Here we should ask: Why?
    Zhang Bojun often said, "Around Mr. Deng, I was a socialist." Under the guise of socialism, Zhang Bojun received the support of the CCP in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, both politically and economically. But Zhang Bojun did not like the people who supported him in his heart. For example, he said more than once that Xu Bing came with a note, and he had to go to Zengjiayan (the Eighth Route Army Office, Premier Zhou and Elder Dong often invited him to discuss matters), which was really despicable. At that time, Zhang Bojun was trying to elevate himself by using the "third force," feeling that the Communist Party had to go through him for this aspect of work. When dealing with the third force, he was obviously relying on the Communist Party's capital. He fundamentally looked down on several leaders of the Democratic League or the later China Democratic League, and only complimented Zhang Junmai. He said that Zhang's knowledge and morality were amazing. Zhang Bojun admired Zuo Shunsheng's insight, talent, and character, but his deepest feelings were for Yang Hu. Every time Bojun returned from Fan Zhuang (Yang Hu's residence), he always talked about how capable and powerful Yang was, with disciples and grandchildren all over the world, and his role in politics, especially military affairs. His words often revealed endless admiration and fascination. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and his arrival in Shanghai, their relationship seemed to deepen. Zhang Bojun once said to me: "Yang Xiaotian wants to find someone to write his own history, pushing all the crimes onto Chiang Kai-shek, and has collected some evidence. I recommend you, and want to invite you to go. After it is written, there will be a large income, which will help your life." I replied casually that this matter was of great importance, so please find someone else! At that time, I secretly thought, could it be that Zhang Bojun wanted to fabricate history for his fellow villager, the chief culprit of the April 12th massacre, in order to sneak into New China with a clean slate and make a political gain? I highly suspected that it was Yang Hu's own idea.
    Zhang Bojun said to people: It is a great pity that English and American parliamentary politics were not added to Chinese socialism.
    It was during the drafting of the constitution, when the CCP delegation led by Premier Zhou was doing its best on behalf of the people to fight for democratic rights from Chiang Kai-shek, that Zhang Bojun said to Guo Zechen and me on the way back to Banshan New Village one hazy moonlit night, "Today we are comrades and friends, all the same. Once the curtain is lifted and we step onto the political stage, the ruler is the ruler, and the subjects are the subjects." We couldn't help but feel terrified when we heard this. The distinction between ruler and subject is the distinction between master and slave. This is the kingdom of "democracy" and "freedom" in the ideals of the "socialist" Zhang Bojun. Zhang Bojun believed that China had not gone through bourgeois democracy, and it was a great pity that English and American parliamentary politics were not added to Chinese socialism. In fact, Zhang Bojun's ambition was not limited to bourgeois democracy. He often enjoyed talking about the mass killings of meritorious officials after Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang came to power, considering it a historical law. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU exposed Stalin, he said, "Look, it's the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, including socialist countries. History will definitely not go backwards." Let the murderous Zhang Bojun be anxious!
    On the eve of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party discussed changing the party name (at that time it was generally called the Third Party). Zhang Bojun alone insisted on using the name "Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party." The reason for everyone's opposition was: The Communist Party is the party of the working class and truly represents the interests of the peasants. Using the words "Peasants and Workers" may not only be misunderstood as wanting to compete with the Communist Party for the peasants and workers, but also completely inconsistent with the party's actual situation. Although Zhang Bojun's opinion was not passed at the meeting, he spread the idea of ​​changing the Third Party to the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party everywhere, gradually turning it into an accomplished fact. By the time the Fourth Cadre Conference was held in Shanghai in 1947, everyone had to admit it. Afterwards, Zhang Bojun said to others, "You are afraid of conflicting with the Communist Party, but I said, I want to compete with the Communist Party for the world!"
    Boasted about Chiang Kai-shek, despised the Communist Party, and hoped to display his ambitions in the "Northern and Southern Dynasties"
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Bojun traveled back and forth on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road. Whenever he returned to Shanghai, our mood of expecting good news was often weighed down by his subjective wishes. For example, how strong Chiang's power was, how well-equipped he was, how strong his combat effectiveness was, and what the generals were like. Finally, there was also the determination of the United States to support him, and the United States would definitely not let Chiang Kai-shek fail. He praised Marshall and Stuart very highly. When talking about the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, he always felt a little discouraged, thinking that this wouldn't work and that would be difficult, as if the rich looked down on the poor. At first, he thought that the Communist Party could only operate in the Yellow River basin, but later the conclusion was: "No one can eliminate anyone, and no one can defeat anyone." At most, it would be a "Northern and Southern Dynasties," a stalemate situation. That is, the north of the Yangtze River belonged to the Communist Party, and the south of the Yangtze River belonged to Chiang Kai-shek and others. Under this stalemate situation, the Third Party had a lot to offer and was politically important. Later, when the Democratic League was forced to disband, Zhang Bojun was pessimistic and disappointed, hiding in Yang Hu's mansion. He said to a young man who came to see him that he was thinking of finding a temple in the north to become a monk.
      In the summer of 1948, I went to Hong Kong. At that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was winning major victories on all battlefields, and the people across the country were rejoicing and cheering for the upcoming national liberation. What do you think the socialist Zhang Bojun, who lived in Kowloon, was doing? He was indulging in the beautiful dream of federalism, preparing his own strength. He had a dedicated person engaged in activities in the military field. He instructed the heads of local organizations that all troops who were turned against the enemy should be marked with the flag of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and should not be handed over to the Communist Party. Zhang Bojun separately transferred responsible cadres from several provinces to give face-to-face instructions. When comrades such as Zeng Wei, Yu Jian, and Zhao Shouxian, who came from Shanghai, advised him not to fantasize about the third road, Zhang Bojun openly said, "Mao Zedong can lead the Chinese revolution, can't I, Zhang Bojun, lead it?" Not long after these three comrades returned to Shanghai, they were tragically murdered by the enemy. After liberation, when some friends talked to Zhang Bojun about the sacrifice of Zeng Wei and others for the revolution, he said that Zeng Wei deserved to die for not listening to him. He said to Lian Ruiqi, "Zeng Wei was against me, he was running errands for the Communist Party." Here, I would like to say in passing: There were far more than just Zeng Wei and the other two good comrades in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, there were whole batches of them. And these people were hated by Zhang Bojun for leaning towards the Communist Party.
    Openly hated the revolution, hated the Communist Party, insulted leftists, and insulted the leaders of the Party
    Obviously, Zhang Bojun did not welcome the army that liberated the Chinese people to cross the river. Because the People's Liberation Army's horseshoes would crush his beautiful dream of an independent kingdom. He was only thinking of taking advantage of the raging flames of the Chinese people's revolution to loot several southern provinces, temporarily act as a small court, and then plan for the future. Zhang Bojun's political ambitions and personal interests made him uncontrollably and even openly hate the revolution and the Communist Party. If it can be said that Zhang Bojun's anti-communism was consistent, it should be said that during his time in Hong Kong, his madness and shamelessness reached their peak. At that time, Zhang Bojun cursed all the leftists, saying that Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, and others were the Communist Party's echoers and had no backbone. He especially despised Zhou Xinmin and other communists in the League. Here I think of Hu Feng's "I hate almost everyone." But Zhang Bojun didn't hate everyone either, he had a good relationship with the rightists. He told me that Zhou Jingwen was a very good person. One afternoon, I went to see Zhou Jingwen, and Zhou also revealed to me his admiration for Zhang Bojun.
    Zhang Bojun's view of the several responsible persons of the CCP in Hong Kong at that time was that so-and-so and other leaders in the past were incompetent, lacked an overall view, and did not understand policies, resulting in chaotic and bad work and a great loss of popular support. Only after Pan Hannian arrived did the situation improve, and he believed that Pan was capable and had a way. But this was only a superficial set. In fact, Zhang Bojun hated the CCP to the bone.
    Because I came from the liberated area, Zhang Bojun suspected that I had joined the Communist Party. Recently (three weeks ago), he also said to Li Boqiu that Yan Xinmin was sent by the Communist Party to monitor him at that time. Therefore, when he saw me, his emotions were sometimes difficult to control.
    One morning, I made a special trip to Zhang Bojun's residence in Kowloon to talk, with Li Jiansheng present. I introduced the situation in the liberated area, talked about various policies, and finally talked about the united front and Premier Zhou's expectations of him. I saw that Zhang Bojun's face was pale, and he suddenly stood up and shouted tremblingly, "Mao Zedong is the first big rogue in Chinese history." I said to calm down and be rational. The conversation ended unhappily.
    This is Zhang Bojun's repayment to the leader loved by 600 million Chinese people, to Chairman Mao Zedong who led the Chinese people from victory to victory.
    Luo Longji said that even if his bones were burned to ashes, no attempt or conspiracy to oppose the Communist Party or oppose socialism could be found. I borrow this sentence to say that even if Zhang Bojun's bones were burned to ashes, what would be found would only be attempts and conspiracies to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism.
    But everyone heard Zhang Bojun say time and time again: He loves the Chinese Communist Party and loves Chairman Mao. Okay, let's talk about what happened after arriving in Beijing!

### 听听章伯钧的狂言：“我说就是要和共产党争天下”！

专栏：

    听听章伯钧的狂言：
    “我说就是要和共产党争天下”！
    中国农工民主党执行局委员　严信民几天来章伯钧在农工民主党内部几次的所谓自我检查，说明他一直到今天还是何等的不老实。他为了说明大家批评他的反共的一贯性，于是一切从头说起。可是在整整三个半天的发言中，谁也找不到一点儿反共的痕迹。相反，倒是他的革命一贯性。章伯钧也承认自己是两面派。可是全部发言所表达的只是一面，只是假相的，口是的一面，而不是真相的，心非的一面。为了提醒章伯钧，我姑且挂一漏万写出以下几点：
      章伯钧算是革命先烈邓演达先生政治遗产的继承者。那么邓演达生前究竟是怎样的看待他呢？据伯钧自己多次说，“邓先生信任季方，不信任我。他的住处从来不让我知道。”这里应该问：为什么？
    章伯钧常说，“在邓先生周围，我是社会主义派。”就在社会主义的幌子下，章伯钧抗战期间在重庆在政治上乃至经济上得到了中共的支持。可是章伯钧的心里并不喜爱支持他的人。如不止一次的说，徐冰来一个条子，就得去曾家岩（八路军办事处、周总理、董老常约他去商量事情），真下作。章伯钧当时对中共是挟第三方面以自重，觉得共产党对这方面的工作非通过他不可。在与第三方面打交道的时候，显然靠的又是共产党的本钱。他根本上看不起民主政团同盟或稍后民盟的几位领导人，独对张君勱恭维备至。说张的学问道德如何了不起。章伯钧很赞赏左舜生的识见、才干和为人，而感情深处还是杨虎。伯钧每自范庄（杨虎住处）归来，总谈到杨如何有办法，有势力，徒子徒孙遍天下，在政治尤其军事上有他的作用等等。言语间则常流露出不尽倾慕、神往的神情。抗战胜利后到上海，他们间的关系似乎更深了一层。章伯钧有一次竟然对我说：“杨啸天想找一个人写他自己的历史，将罪恶部分都推到蒋介石身上，并已搜集得若干证件，我推荐你，想请你去。写好后，有一大宗收入，对你生活会有帮助。”我顺便答复说，兹事体大，请另找高明吧！当时我暗自思忖，莫非章伯钧想替自己的同乡，四一二滔天罪行的首恶伪造历史，以清白之身混进新中国并在政治上捞一把么？我很怀疑那是杨虎自己的主意。
    章伯钧对人说：中国社会主义里没有加上英美的议会政治是一件大憾事
    正是起草宪法，以周总理为首的中共代表团代表全国人民用尽心机向蒋介石争民主权利的时候，在一个月色朦胧之夜，漫步回半山新村的途中，章伯钧向郭则沉和我谈心事时说，“今天我们是同志、朋友，大家一样。将来一旦揭开二帘子，登了政治舞台，君就是君，臣就是臣”。我们听了不禁为之毛骨悚然。君臣之分，即主奴之分。这就是“社会主义”者章伯钧理想中的“民主”“自由”的王国。章伯钧认为中国没有经过资产阶级民主，中国的社会主义里没有加上英美的议会政治，是一件大大的憾事。其实章伯钧之志，何止于资产阶级的民主。他常乐道刘邦、朱元璋执政后的大杀功巨，认为是历史规律。苏共二十次代表大会揭露斯大林后，他说，你看，古今中外，包括社会主义国家都是一样。历史肯定的是不会倒退回去的。让杀气腾腾的章伯钧干着急吧！
    抗战胜利前夕，农工民主党中央商议改换党名（当时一般称之为第三党），章伯钧一个人坚持用农工民主党名称。大家反对的理由是：共产党是工人阶级的政党，同时也真正代表了农民的利益。用农工二字，不仅可能被人误会为要与共产党争农工，且与党的真实情况完全不符。章伯钧的意见会上虽然没有通过，但他事后到处散布第三党改为农工民主党的空气，渐渐酿成既成事实。到1947年在上海开第四次干部会议时，大家只好承认了。事后章伯钧对人说，“你们怕与共产党有抵触，我说，就是要和共产党争天下！”
    夸耀蒋介石　鄙视共产党希望在“南北朝”中施展抱负
    抗战胜利后，章伯钧仆仆于沪宁道上，每当他回到上海的时候，我们期待好消息的心情，常因他主观愿望的那一套沉重起来。如蒋的实力多么强，装备如何，战斗力如何，将领们又是怎样。最后，还有美国决心支持，美国一定不会让蒋介石失败。对马歇尔，司徒雷登更是赞不绝口。谈到共产党，人民解放军时总觉得有些泄气，这也不行，那也困难，好像富人看不起穷人的样子。起初认为共产党只能活动在黄河流域，后来的结论是：“谁也消灭不了谁，谁也不能战胜谁。”至多是个“南北朝”，是个相持的局面。即长江以北是共产党，江南是蒋介石及其他。在这相持的局面下，第三方面大有可为。在政治上举足轻重。后来民盟被迫解散，章伯钧悲观失望，躲在杨虎公馆，对见他的一位青年说，想到北方找个寺庙去当和尚。
      1948年夏我到香港。那时正是中国人民解放军在各战场上获得重大胜利，全国人民为行将到来的全国解放欢腾鼓舞的时候，你想，住在九龙的社会主义者章伯钧又是怎样呢？他陶醉在联邦制的美梦里，准备自己的力量。在军事方面他设有专人从事活动。他指示地方组织负责人，凡策反过来的军队一律插上农工民主党的旗帜，不要交给共产党，章伯钧分别抽调过几省负责干部面授机宜。当由上海来的曾伟、虞健、赵寿先几位同志劝他不要幻想第三条道路的时候，章伯钧公然说，毛泽东能领导中国革命，难道我章伯钧就不能领导吗？这三位同志回上海不久，就惨遭了敌人的毒手，解放后几位朋友向章伯钧谈到曾伟等为革命牺牲的时候，他说曾伟死的活该，谁叫他不听我的话。对连瑞琦说，“曾伟是反对我的，他是替共产党跑腿的。”在这里我愿顺便说一句：农工民主党的好同志决不止曾伟等三人，是有整批整批的。而这些人都是以靠拢共产党被章伯钧恨之入骨的。
    公开仇视革命仇视共产党辱骂左派人士辱骂党的领袖
    很显然，章伯钧是不欢迎解放中国人民的大军渡江的。因为解放军的马蹄会捣碎他那独立王国的美梦。他想的只是乘中国人民革命的熊熊火焰，劫夺南方几个省份，权且作个小朝庭，再策划未来。章伯钧的政治野心，个人利益，使他情不可遏地，甚至公开地仇视革命，仇视共产党。如果说章伯钧的反共有其一贯性，应该说，他在香港的那一段时期，其疯狂、无耻，已经达到了最高峰。当时章伯钧骂尽所有的左派，说郭沫若、邓初民等是共产党的应声虫，没有骨气。尤其鄙视的是盟内共产党人周新民等。在这里我想到胡风的“我几乎恨一切人”。但章伯钧恨的也不是所有的人，他同右派的感情很好，他向我说周鲸文这个人很不错。我在一个下午去看周鲸文，周也对我流露出对章伯钧的仰慕之忱。
    章伯钧对中共当时在香港的几位负责人的看法是，过去某某等领导工作，无能，不识大体，不懂政策，结果搞乱，搞坏了工作，大失人心，才是潘汉年到后情况有所改变，认为潘能干，有办法。但这还只是表面的一套，事实上章伯钧对中共是恨入骨髓的。
    我因为由解放区来，章伯钧怀疑我入了共产党。最近，（三个礼拜前）他还向李伯球说，严信民当时是共产党派来监视我的。所以他见了我，有时感情难以控制起来。
    有一天上午，我专诚到九龙章伯钧寓所去谈话，有李健生在场。我介绍了解放区情况，谈到各种政策，最后谈到统一战线，谈到周总理对他的期望。我看到章伯钧的脸色苍白，他猛然站起身来，颤抖抖地喊叫“毛泽东是中国历史上第一个大流氓”。我说还是镇静一点，理智一点。一场谈话就是这样地不欢而散了。
    这就是章伯钧对六亿中国人民热爱的领袖，对领导中国人民由胜利走向胜利的毛泽东主席的报答。
    罗隆基说，把他的骨头烧成灰，也找不到反对共产党反对社会主义的企图和阴谋。我借这句话说，把章伯钧的骨头烧成灰，找到的也只是反对共产党，反对社会主义的企图和阴谋。
    可是大家都听到章伯钧口口声声说：他热爱中国共产党，热爱毛主席。好，到北京后的事情再说吧！
