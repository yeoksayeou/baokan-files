Vietnam Will Definitely Be Unified

Phạm Văn Bạch, Former Chairman of the Resistance Administrative Committee of South Vietnam

The Geneva Accords restored peace in Indochina and clearly recognized the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Geneva Accords stipulated that free general elections would be held in Vietnam in July 1956 to restore national unification.

How has the Vietnamese side performed since the signing of the Geneva Accords in July 1954?

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as it has repeatedly stated, has been fulfilling and will continue to fulfill its obligations.

In the political sphere, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has stated more than once its desire to achieve Vietnamese unification through peaceful means, in accordance with the Geneva Accords. In July 1955, it suggested to the South Vietnamese authorities that a consultative conference be convened to discuss the issue of free general elections in order to restore national unification. In its reply to the letter from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8, 1956, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reiterated its proposal made to the South Vietnamese authorities on May 11, 1956, regarding discussions on the issue of general elections. On June 8 of this year, it once again expressed to the two chairmen its desire to respect and implement the Geneva Accords.

However, the situation on the side of the South Vietnamese authorities is exactly the opposite. Under the support and instigation of its American masters, it has been systematically violating and continues to violate the spirit and protocols of the Geneva Accords, for which South Vietnam has a legally inescapable responsibility. At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities have not responded to the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and have consistently refused to restore normal relations between the North and the South. Furthermore, it has taken a series of measures to keep the South in a state of division from the North: on March 4, 1956, it held a unilateral election to establish a so-called "parliament"; on October 26, 1956, it promulgated a "constitution" – all of which were carried out in a fascist manner. During his recent visit to the United States, Ngô Đình Diệm openly declared that no general elections would be held as long as North Vietnam remained under its current regime, and he also stated that "the borders of the United States extend to the 17th parallel." Meanwhile, for three years, American military personnel and weapons have been flowing into South Vietnam continuously, and American generals are in control of the construction and training of Ngô Đình Diệm's army. The issue is clear: the Americans are attempting to turn South Vietnam into an American military base for aggression in Southeast Asia. The South Vietnamese authorities, following the American policy of undermining peace and unification in Vietnam, have violated Article 14 of the Geneva Accords by carrying out repression and retaliation against the people and former resistance personnel, and have recently refused to recognize this provision.

Currently, peace in Vietnam is facing increasingly serious threats, and the sacred desire of the Vietnamese people to unify their motherland has been dealt a blow. This situation should undoubtedly be blamed on the American interventionists and the Ngô Đình Diệm clique. They are conspiring to sabotage the Geneva Accords and the peaceful unification of Vietnam, and to turn South Vietnam into an American colony and military base. For three years, the people of South Vietnam, including national bourgeois elements, have been continuously waging a fierce struggle against American intervention and for the peace and unification of the country. All the Vietnamese people and peace-loving people around the world are supporting this struggle. More and more people in Ngô Đình Diệm's army sympathize with this struggle. Even Harold Davies, a British Labour MP who recently made a short visit to Saigon to visit South Vietnamese government personnel, showed some sympathy for this struggle.

The Vietnamese people on both sides of the provisional military demarcation line are uniting more and more closely, fighting for the respect and implementation of the Geneva Accords. These accords were obtained at the cost of significant bloodshed by our people. We are waging a struggle based on the accords to achieve national unification and territorial integrity, as stated by Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng at the closing session of the Geneva Conference: "We will win unification as we have won peace. No force in the world – whether domestic or foreign – can divert us from this path of peaceful and democratic unification." This is the invincible common will and most pressing desire of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people believe it is absolutely necessary to defend peace and the independence and sovereignty of their country. Whether from a national or historical perspective, Vietnam is an indivisible whole. Attempts to undermine the unification of Vietnam are criminal attempts that violate the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people, and are also absurd fantasies that defy reality. History and recent events have proven the patriotic spirit, courage, and unwavering dedication of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will fight to the end for their sacred cause. They are deeply convinced that, like the victories won in the past, future victories will also be victories for the cause of peace and democracy in Southeast Asia and the world.

### 越南一定会统一起来  前南越抗战行政委员会主席范文白

    越南一定会统一起来
    前南越抗战行政委员会主席范文白
    日内瓦协议恢复了印度支那的和平，明确承认越南、老挝和柬埔寨的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。日内瓦协议规定1956年7月在越南举行自由普选，以恢复国家统一。
    从1954年7月日内瓦协议签订以后，越南方面履行的情况如何呢？
    越南民主共和国政府正如它屡次声明的那样，一直在履行、并且还将继续履行它的义务。
    在政治方面，越南民主共和国政府不止一次地申明根据日内瓦协议通过和平道路实现越南统一的愿望。1955年7月，它曾向南越当局建议召开协商会议讨论自由普选问题，以恢复国家的统一。越南民主共和国政府在对1956年5月8日日内瓦会议两位主席来函的答复中，重申了1956年5月11日向南越当局提出的关于讨论普选问题的建议。今年6月8日，它又一次向两位主席表达了尊重与履行日内瓦协议的愿望。
    然而南越当局方面的情况却正相反。它在美国主子的支持和指使下，一直在有计划地违反、并且还在继续违反日内瓦协议的精神和议定书，而南越对协议是有着法律上的不可逃避的责任的。同时，南越当局对越南民主共和国的建议也不作答复，并且一直拒绝恢复北部和南部之间的正常关系。不仅如此，它还采取一系列的措施，使南部处于和北部分裂的状态：1956年3月4日，它举行了片面选举，成立所谓“议会”；1956年10月26日颁布“宪法”——这一切都是按照法西斯的方式进行的。吴庭艳最近到美国访问时曾公开宣称，只要北越处于目前的政权下就不举行普选，他还说“美国的边界一直延长到十七度线”。同时，三年以来美国军事人员和武器源源不断地流入南越，美国将军掌握着吴庭艳军队的建设与教练。问题很明显，美国人企图把南越变成美国在东南亚的军事侵略基地。南越当局追随美国的破坏越南和平和统一的政策，违反日内瓦协议第十四条的规定，对人民与前抗战人员施行镇压和报复，并在最近拒绝承认这条规定。
    目前越南的和平正在日益遭受到严重的威胁，越南人民统一祖国的神圣愿望受到了打击，这就是日内瓦协议履行的情况。这种情况无可置疑地应该归罪于美国干涉者和吴庭艳集团。它们阴谋破坏日内瓦协议和越南的和平统一，并将南越变为美国殖民地和军事基地。三年以来，南越人民，包括民族资产阶级人士，不断地进行着激烈的斗争，反对美国的干涉，争取国家的和平和统一。全体越南人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都在支持这一斗争。在吴庭艳的部队中有愈来愈多的人同情这一斗争。甚至于最近到西贡对南越政府人员作短期访问的英国工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯也对这一斗争有所同情。
    越南人民在临时军事分界线的两边愈加紧密地团结在一起，为尊重和履行日内瓦协议而进行着斗争。这一协议是我国人民以重大的流血牺牲为代价取得的。我们以协议为依据展开斗争，争取实现国家统一和领土的完整，正如范文同总理在日内瓦会议闭幕会议上的声明中所说：“我们将像已经赢得和平那样赢得统一。世界上没有任何力量——不论是国内的还是国外的力量——能使我们离开通过和平和民主走向统一的这条道路”。这就是越南人民不可战胜的共同意志和最迫切的愿望。越南人民认为有绝对必要来保卫和平和祖国的独立与主权。无论从国家的特点或历史来看，越南都是一个不可分割的整体。破坏越南统一的企图是违反越南人民的民族愿望的罪恶企图，也是违背现实的荒谬幻想。历史上和最近发生的事件已经证实了越南人民的爱国思想、勇敢和坚持不渝的精神。越南人民将为自己的神圣事业斗争到底。他们深信，正像过去所获得的胜利一样，未来的胜利，也是东南亚和全世界和平、民主事业的胜利。  （李宁来译）
