(Our Hefei dispatch, July 21st) The more than four million mu of double-cropping early rice sown in Anhui Province's rice-producing areas this year has begun to be harvested. The fields are filled with golden rice, and a bumper harvest is in sight. In two days, the Huiguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Tunxi City on the banks of the Xin'an River harvested 161 mu, with an average yield of 522.5 jin per mu. The lowest yield of early rice in Qianrenqiao District, Shucheng County, also reached more than 310 jin.

Double-cropping rice was widely promoted in Anhui last year as one of the three agricultural reforms. Based on the experience and lessons learned from planting double-cropping rice last year, this year's double-cropping early rice was sown in a more localized and timely manner. In addition, this year's rainfall has been relatively even, and the double-cropping early rice has generally grown very well. The peasants' enthusiasm for production has been greatly encouraged. They are harvesting early rice while hurrying to transplant late rice, striving for a bumper harvest every season this year.

    安徽农民边收早稻边插晚稻秧
    本报合肥21日电　安徽省水稻产区今年播种的四百多万亩双季早稻已经开镰收割。田野里一片金黄色的稻禾，丰收已在眼前。新安江畔屯溪市郊徽光农业社两天中割了一百六十一亩，每亩平均产量五百二十二斤半。舒城县千人桥区的早稻最低的产量也达三百一十多斤。
    双季稻是安徽去年农业三项改革中普遍被推广的，根据去年种双季稻的经验教训，今年双季早稻都比较因地制宜地适时下种。加以今年雨水比较均匀，双季早稻一般都生长很好。农民的生产热情受到很大的鼓舞。他们一边收割早稻，一边赶忙栽晚稻，争取今年季季丰收。
