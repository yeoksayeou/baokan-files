    China-Sudan Football Friendly Match
    United Second Team Wins 4-0
    (Our newspaper reports) The first African football team to visit our country, the Sudanese football team, played a friendly match yesterday at the Xiannongtan Stadium against China's United Team Second Team. The result of the match was a 4-0 victory for the United Second Team.
    The home team scored the first goal 22 minutes after the start of the match. The United Second Team pressed into the away team's penalty area. The away team's left-back, Babikir, was anxious to save the ball and fouled. The home team's right inside forward, Chen Jialiang, took the penalty kick and opened the scoring. At 35 minutes, the home team's right-winger, Pan Peigen, received a ball from the midfielder, quickly dribbled past the opponent's defender, and shot from the touchline. The ball touched goalkeeper Doudou's hand and bounced into the net. In the second half, the home team took advantage of several corner kick opportunities, with center forward Sheng Jinrong and left inside forward Xian Dixiong each heading in a goal.
    The away team's failure was mainly due to their slow speed and low passes during the attack. Therefore, when they gained possession and advanced towards the opponent, the home team members had already retreated and set up defenses. However, the away team's delicate triangular short passes and fierce shots posed a great threat to the home team. The United Second Team's goalkeeper, Xu Fusheng, was agile and saved several dangerous shots, preventing the away team from scoring a goal. During the match, left-back Sun Yuming even used his chest to block a fierce shot on an open goal by the away team's forward. (Attached picture)

    中国苏丹足球友谊赛
    联二队以四比零获胜
    本报讯  第一个来我国的非洲足球队——苏丹足球队昨日在先农坛体育场对我国联队二队举行了一场友谊比赛，比赛结果，联二队以四比零获胜。
    主队射入的第一个球是在开赛后二十二分钟。联二队带球压往客队禁区内，客队左后卫巴比克尔救球心切，不慎犯规，由主队右内锋陈家亮罚球点球，陈一脚首开记录。到三十五分钟时，主队右翼潘培根在接到前卫踢来的球后，飞快地盘过对方后卫，在边线一脚射门，球碰守门员都都手内弹入网内。下半时，主队利用几次发角球的机会，由中锋盛金荣和左内锋冼迪雄各顶进一球。
    客队失败的原因主要是速度慢，进攻时都是低传球，因此当他们得球后向对方挺进时，主队队员早已退守布防，但客队细腻的三角短传和凶狠的射门，曾给主队很大的威胁，联二队由于守门员徐福生身手矫捷，扑救了好几个险球，才未被客队攻入一球，其间左后卫孙玉明还曾用胸部挡出客队前锋猛射空门的球。（附图片）
