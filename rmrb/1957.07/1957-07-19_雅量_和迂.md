"Generosity" and Stupidity
Liu Jia

I once wrote a short article entitled "'Exclusion' and Unity," which mainly exposed the position of people like Ge Peiqi. However, due to insufficient understanding of the essence of people like Ge Peiqi at the time, some of the statements in the article were ambiguous and even wrong. For example, I once said: "Mr. Ge frankly spoke his inner thoughts, which is good. I do not 'exclude' all of what he said. Some of it objectively has the effect of unpalatable advice, and it does not fail to be a piece of sincere advice to Communist Party members. This part should be welcomed and used to stimulate deep thinking; some are just venting dissatisfaction and are angry words, which should be understood, and the reasons for these dissatisfactions should be further explored and eliminated if possible."

It is right to "welcome" words that "objectively have the effect of unpalatable advice" and to "understand" "angry words" for those who sincerely help the Party in rectification and said the wrong things. But it is wrong for those like Ge Peiqi who are extremely hostile to the Communist Party and socialism, intend to overthrow them, and thus viciously attack the Communist Party and socialism. Look, to say that the malicious attacks on the Party by a rightist are "not entirely 'excluded'," is this not extremely absurd?

What is the reason for the mistake? The main reason is that the true face of people like Ge Peiqi was not clearly recognized at the time, and they were mistakenly regarded as "ordinary people with only an erroneous position." It was not recognized that they were rightists with ulterior motives. Therefore, when clarifying their position, I first thought of so-called "generosity," and then proposed "welcome," "understanding," and "exclusion" in parallel, as if "excluding" a part of them would achieve "unity." It was not recognized that only by "excluding" all of their existing things, that is, reversing their entire anti-Communist Party and anti-socialist set from motivation to words and deeds, and replacing it with a new set that accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and serves socialism, can true unity be achieved. This kind of "generosity" is "grand" and "especially grand," but it is not conducive to the people's struggle against the rightists, and it is not conducive to achieving true unity.

Secondly, it is "stupidity." It seems that as long as the rightists' offensive is carried out under the guise of helping the Party in rectification, I must also treat them as people who are helping the Party in rectification. Therefore, while pointing out that their position is wrong, I still somewhat admit that their "motives are good." This is precisely why the rightists like to raise the banner of "helping the Party in rectification." In fact, why can't this banner be torn down? The pragmatic approach is to first look at what kind of goods he is selling, rather than what kind of banner he is holding. Moreover, my view of separating "position" and "motive" is also a baffling confusion.

"Generosity" that does not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves (here, the enemy refers to the rightists among the people, which is different from the counter-revolutionary enemy) is itself "stupidity." This is exactly what the rightists demand. For us, this is precisely one of the roots of "sentimentalism."

I feel ashamed because, at the beginning, I did not recognize the temperament of people like Ge Peiqi as clearly as most working people. This shows that to completely overcome sentimentalism (including conscious or unconscious sentimentalism), we must learn more from the working people.

    “雅量”和迂
    刘甲
    我曾写过一篇“‘排斥’和团结”的短文，主要是揭露葛佩琦之流的人的立场的。但由于当时对葛佩琦之流的本质认识不足，文中有些说法是似是而非以至于错误的。例如我曾说过：“葛先生坦率地讲出了自己的内心话，那是好的。对他所讲的话，我也并不全部‘排斥’。其中有些在客观上具有逆耳忠言的作用，不失之为给共产党员的一种忠告。对这部分应该欢迎，并借以引起深思；有些只是发泄胸中的不满，是些气话，对这应该谅解，并进一步去探讨引起这些不满的原因，在可能的条件下加以消除。”
    对“在客观上具有逆耳忠言的作用”的话“欢迎”，对“气话”“谅解”，这对一般诚心帮助党整风而说错了话的人来说，是应该的。但对葛佩琦之流的极端仇视共产党和社会主义，意在打倒因而才恶毒地攻击共产党和社会主义的人来说，就是错误的。请看，对一个右派分子所恶意攻击党的话，“并不全部‘排斥’”，这岂不是绝大的荒谬。
    错的原因何在？主要是当时对葛佩琦之流的真面目认识不清，错把他们当作“只是具有错误立场的一般人”。而没有认清他们是别有用心的右派分子。于是在揭明他们的立场的时候，首先就想到了所谓“雅量”，于是便并列地提出了“欢迎”，“谅解”和“排斥”，好像只要“排斥”掉其中一部分，便可达到“团结”了，而没有认识到只有“排斥”掉他们全部现有的东西，即反掉他们从动机到言行的整个反共产党反社会主义的一套，换上新的接受共产党领导，为社会主义服务的一套，才能有真正的团结。这样“量”是“大雅”而“特雅”了，却不利于人民对右派分子的斗争，也就不利于达成真正的团结。
    其次是“迂”。好像只要右派分子的进攻，是在帮助党整风的幌子下进行的，我便也得把他们当作帮助党整风的人来对待才行，于是在指明他们的立场错了的同时，却又有些承认他们的“动机是好的”。这正是右派分子们喜欢打起“帮助党整风”幌子的原因。其实为什么不可以撕毁这个幌子呢？实事求是的作法，是先不看他是什么幌子，而是先看他是卖的什么货色。何况我的这种把“立场”和“动机”分割开的看法，也是一种莫名其妙的糊涂东西。
    不区别敌、我（这里的敌是指的人民中的右派分子，不同于反革命的敌）的“雅量”、本身就是“迂”。这正是右派分子所要求的。在我们来说这也恰恰就是“温情主义”产生的一种根源。
    我觉得有愧，因为一开始我并没有像多数劳动人民那样对葛佩琦之流的气质识别得那样清楚。这说明要彻底克服温情主义（包括自觉的或不自觉的），还要多多地向劳动者学习才行。
