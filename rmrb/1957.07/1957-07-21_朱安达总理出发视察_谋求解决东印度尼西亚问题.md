Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Indonesian Premier Djuanda and Third Deputy Premier Leimena left on the morning of the 19th to inspect the Moluccas and Ambon in Eastern Indonesia. According to a statement issued by Djuanda on the 18th, they will discuss issues related to administration, economy, and local construction with local governments.

A government delegation composed of the Minister of Justice and others arrived in Manado the day before yesterday. It is reported that all four representatives are originally from Sulawesi, and they will consult with former 7th Military Region Commander Sumual and others to resolve local issues.

Sumual, who has been relieved of his post as commander of the 7th Military Region, is currently stationed in North Sulawesi. This officer, who launched the Sulawesi incident in Makassar on March 2nd, transferred to Manado shortly after handing over military power of the 7th Military Region in June. There, he openly expressed his disobedience to central orders, unilaterally announced the division of Eastern Indonesia into six autonomous provinces, and unilaterally established the "North Sulawesi Province."

    朱安达总理出发视察
    谋求解决东印度尼西亚问题
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚总理朱安达和第三副总理莱梅纳19日上午动身到东印度尼西亚的摩鹿加和安汶等地去视察。据朱安达18日发表的公报说，他们要同地方政府讨论行政、经济和地方建设方面的问题。
    由司法部长等组成的政府代表团已经在前天到达万鸦老。据报道，四个代表都是原籍苏拉威西的，他们将同前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔等人进行协商，以便解决当地的问题。
    已经被解除第七军区司令职务的苏穆阿尔目前驻在北苏拉威西。这个在3月2日在望加锡发动了苏拉威西事件的军官，6月间交出了第七军区兵权之后不久，又转移到万鸦老去。他在那里公开表示不服从中央命令，擅自宣布把东印度尼西亚划分为六个自治省，并且擅自成立了“北苏拉威西省”。
