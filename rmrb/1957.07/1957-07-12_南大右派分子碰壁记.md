Record of Bumping into Walls by Rightists at Nanjing University
By our reporters Zhen Weimin and Shi Yue'e

In the anti-Rightist struggle, more than five thousand faculty and students of Nanjing University underwent a serious political test. Now the rampant attacks of the Rightists have been repelled, all kinds of absurd and reactionary remarks have been powerfully countered, and the Rightists have been completely isolated.

The Rightists Launched a General Offensive

At the beginning of this rectification movement, the Party and government leadership of Nanjing University called on all faculty and students to help the Party eliminate the "three evils." The University Party Committee successively held seventeen discussion meetings, and the vast majority of teachers put forward many correct criticisms of the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian work styles of the school leaders.

At this time, some Rightists, believing they had an opportunity, launched a frenzied attack on the Party. Rightist Liu Jingkun (lecturer in the History Department) in his article "What Harmed Nanjing University?" compared the people's Nanjing University with the puppet Central University, where Chiang Kai-shek served as president before liberation, saying that Nanjing University had "declined"; saying that "today's Nanjing University, with its many old and injured, crippled and disabled, is not worthy of the former magnificent Central University." Liu Disheng (real name Liu Jin), a teaching assistant in the Chinese Department, clamored for the Communist Party to "liberate" the Chinese people for the second time. He published a set of programs against the leadership of the Party, including the proposition that "Party factions in schools do not need to operate among students"; primary and secondary schools "should abolish the Young Pioneers and the Communist Youth League organizations." Lin Wenzheng (member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang), deputy director of the Foreign Languages Department, incited students, saying: "The school is carrying out great democracy, the Party should be responsible, and student actions are being forced out." Lei Kan (real name Situ Jian), a student in the Geology Department, put forward the counter-revolutionary "Twenty-Article Program," which included: "Strive for democracy and freedom"; "Support the opinions of Committee Member Luo Longji"; "Marxism-Leninism should be an elective"; "The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang should be equal to the CCP"; "Oppose Party and League privileges," and so on. Wang Yunhui, a student in the French section of the Foreign Languages Department, arrogantly shouted: "In my opinion, in this rectification, ten million of the twelve million Party members should be killed." "If this movement starts, I must kill to my heart's content." He vainly attempted to mobilize students to take to the streets and petition the Provincial Party Committee, but did not receive the support of most students, with only a dozen or so responding.

Pasting Big-Character Posters at the Entrance of the Newspaper Office Met with Public Condemnation

The attack of the Rightists at Nanjing University on the Party was particularly manifested in the affair of mobilizing more than thirty students to paste big-character posters at the entrance of the Xinhua Daily. In the big-character posters, they strongly questioned the Xinhua Daily, asking why it did not publish news of the "democratic upsurge" of students in their school, saying that Wenhui Daily reported on the "Democracy Wall" of Peking University, so why did the Xinhua Daily not report on the Democracy Wall of Nanjing University, and they slandered and satirized the newspaper's reporters and editors. But the big-character posters pasted at the entrance of the newspaper office aroused a chorus of opposition from passers-by. A worker surnamed Fan indignantly accused the students, saying: "Your school is carrying out rectification, what are you doing coming here? You are using methods for dealing with the enemy to deal with contradictions among the people." Another worker asked the surrounding masses, "Does everyone agree to tear down the big-character posters?" The masses shouted in unison: "Agree!" Thus, some of the big-character posters were torn down. An old lady said: "Are you students? The state and the people support you, are they telling you to do these things?" One student argued: "This is our freedom?" The old lady said excitedly: "You are hindering other people's freedom of traffic, and still talking about freedom." Two children wearing red scarves questioned the university students, saying: "You older brothers will be our teachers in the future, how can you not abide by discipline."

An electrician argued with three students for an hour, and in the end, two students were left speechless. One student realized the error, and he said to the worker: "I support your opinion."

A student named Cao Dake could not argue against a forty-year-old housewife named Zhuo Hongge, and called the woman "shameless." The woman dragged him to the police station for a judgment, and in the end, the student realized his mistake and apologized to the woman.

A Nanjing University student questioned the masses as to why they were tearing down the slogans. The masses retorted: "Do you say they are pasted correctly?" The student had to say: "Incorrectly." The masses said: "If they are pasted incorrectly, then tearing them down is correct." Many people even ordered the students who pasted the big-character posters to tear them down themselves, and the masses applauded these students and a group of children for tearing down the big-character posters they had pasted.

The next day, several students secretly went to the entrance of the newspaper office to paste big-character posters again, and were again surrounded by the masses. Seeing that the situation was not good, the students who pasted the big-character posters secretly took off the Nanjing University school badges and returned, having run into a wall.

The Twenty-Article Reactionary Program Was Refuted Completely

Although the Rightists' remarks temporarily confused some of the masses, they were soon surrounded and attacked from all sides. As soon as Rightist Lei Kan's reactionary "Twenty-Article Program" was posted, someone refuted it. At a debate on June 1, Lei Kan's fallacies were criticized completely. The first speaker refuted Lei Kan's so-called fallacy of "striving for freedom and democracy." He said: "We are already living in socialist democracy and freedom. We are the people's university students, enjoying the freedom that university students should enjoy. The Party has proposed 'Let a hundred flowers bloom', and the school has also opened free forums and supported us in posting big-character posters. Are these not democracy and freedom?" The speaker continued: "Lei Kan demands that 'the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang be equal to the CCP.' If it is said to be long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, the Communist Party has already given the democratic parties very high equal rights. If it refers to the issue of leadership, then the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates the leading position of the Chinese Communist Party, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee also raised their hands in agreement." He also said: "Lei Kan opposes making Marxism-Leninism a required course. I believe that the vast majority of young people and democratic parties will not agree. The people's university students are not muddleheads. They demand to transform their thinking, and making Marxism-Leninism a required course is precisely to better transform their thinking and serve the people. Lei Kan says he opposes Party and League privileges. If he is opposing the privileged thinking of certain Party members, I agree. But if he generally opposes authority and opposes the leadership of the Party, then he is advocating anarchism."

In the face of truth, lies and fallacies cannot stand. After several debates, Lei Kan finally had to admit his mistakes.

Rightist Liu Jingkun Lowers His Head

After the People's Daily published several inspiring editorials in succession from June 8, the will of the teachers and students of Nanjing University to fight against the Rightists became more firm.

At a gathering of more than five thousand people throughout the school on July 1 and 2, teachers Jiang Zuanfang and Zu Qingnian of the History Department, and Party Committee member Pu Qiheng, revealed the reactionary remarks of Rightist Liu Jingkun: Liu once said to the Party members of the History Department: High-ranking Party cadres, including some leading comrades of the Central Committee, have begun to become corrupt and are no longer revolutionary. Therefore, he wants to establish another "Party Central Committee" with himself as the "Chairman." Liu Jingkun believes that "the Kuomintang did good things and developed the productive forces," so he wants to write a "History of the Republic of China" and become an "expert in the History of the Republic of China." He once told a professor in the History Department that he wanted to go to Hong Kong to be a "critic" of the Communist Party and write a book entitled "The Chinese Communist Party I Know" to expose the "darkness" of the Party.

Many professors were deeply shocked after hearing the revelations. Han Ruilin, director of the History Department, used his own experiences to refute Liu Jingkun's fallacies. Han Ruilin taught at the former Central University for five years, serving as Dean of the Law School. Due to poverty and illness, coupled with the intensity of teaching work, he often vomited blood. Professor Han Ruilin couldn't help but shed tears when he mentioned the past. He said that this was Liu Jingkun's so-called "Golden Age" of the Kuomintang. Professor Han Ruilin also said: "After liberation, my life underwent fundamental changes, my thinking became enlightened, my spirit became happy, and I received unprecedented respect and love from the country." Professor Jiang Mengyin said that he entered Central University in 1928. He recounted the facts that he had witnessed many teachers and students being persecuted by the Kuomintang during the twenty years, refuting the fallacy that the Kuomintang's operation of Central University for twenty years had achieved results. Li Fangxun, vice president of Nanjing University, also used the fact that Nanjing University has compiled one hundred kinds of teaching materials in the past five years, published one hundred and twenty papers at this year's scientific research report meeting, and trained more than three thousand one hundred graduates to refute Liu Jingkun's fallacy that Nanjing University has "declined." In the face of ironclad facts, Liu Jingkun had no choice but to lower his head.

At several other school-wide mass rallies, the erroneous remarks of Rightists Liu Disheng and Wang Yunhui were also fatally struck.

This is Only a Preliminary Victory

At present, the anti-Rightist struggle at Nanjing University has just begun to deepen. Up to now, there are still people writing anonymous letters and still engaging in dirty tricks behind the scenes; some Rightists have not yet received the deserved counterattacks. For example, Rightist Lin Wenzheng is a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang. He has published many reactionary remarks and is viciously intentioned, but the Nanjing University branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has not carried out forceful criticism of his remarks, demonstrating an attitude of tolerating evil.

On July 5, the "Letter to the People and Students of the Whole Province" signed by three thousand three hundred and two students of Nanjing University stated: "Now our anti-Rightist struggle has achieved preliminary victory, but we have not yet achieved the final victory. Some Rightists have not yet truly lowered their heads and confessed their crimes, some are still openly resisting, and some are still hiding and crouching. Therefore, we must continue to fight, and we will never stop until we win complete victory."

    南大右派分子碰壁记
    本报记者　甄为民　史越峨
    南京大学全校五千多名师生在反右派斗争中经受了一次严重的政治考验。现在右派分子的猖狂进攻已被打退，各种荒谬的反动的言论已遭到了有力的反击，右派分子完全陷于孤立。
    右派分子发动了总攻
    在这次整风运动开始时，南京大学的党政领导部门号召全校师生帮助党消除“三害”，校党委先后召开了十七次座谈会，绝大部分教师，对学校领导的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义提出了许多正确的批评。
    这时，部分右派分子，认为有机可乘，就向党进行了疯狂的进攻。右派分子刘敬坤（历史系讲师）在“什么东西害了南京大学”一文中，把人民的南大和解放前蒋介石担任校长的伪中央大学相比，说南大“破落了”；说“今天五老七伤，断腿残足的南京大学和昔日的堂堂中央大学不相称了”。中文系助教刘地生（真名刘锦）则叫嚣要共产党第二次“解放”中国人民。他发表了一套反对党的领导的纲领，其中主张“学校中的党派，不需要在学生中活动”；中小学“应取消少先队和青年团的组织”。外文系副主任林文铮（民革成员）煽动学生说：“学校搞大民主，党应负责，学生行动是被逼出来的”。地质系学生雷戡（真名司徒坚）提出了反革命的“二十条纲领”，内容有：“力争民主自由”；“拥护罗隆基委员意见”；“马列主义要选修”；“中国国民党革命委员会应与中共平等”；“反对党团特权”等。外文系法文组学生汪云辉狂妄地叫喊：“依我意见，这次整风，一千二百万党员要杀掉一千万”。“如果这次动起来，我一定要杀个痛快”。他妄想动员学生上街游行和到省委去请愿，却得不到多数学生的支持，响应者只寥寥十余人。
    到报社门口去贴大字报，遭到群众痛斥
    南京大学右派分子对党的进攻，特别表现在发动三十多名学生到新华日报门口贴大字报的事情上。他们在大字报上强硬地质问新华日报，为什么不登他们校内学生“民主高潮”的消息，说文汇报报道了北大的“民主墙”，新华日报为什么不报道南大的民主墙，并谩骂、讽刺报社记者和编者。但大字报贴在报社门口，引起过路群众一片反对声。一个姓范的工人愤慨地指责学生说：“你们学校整风，整到这里来干什么？你们这是用对付敌人的办法来对付人民内部矛盾”。另一个工人问周围的群众，撕掉大字报大家同意吗？群众一致喊：“同意”。这样，大字报被撕去了一部分。一位老太太说：“你们是学生么？国家人民养活你们，就叫你们干这些事的吗？”一个学生辩解说：“这是我们的自由？”老太太激动地说：“你们妨碍了人家的交通自由，还说什么自由。”两个围红领巾的小朋友责问大学生说：“你们这些大哥哥将来还要做我们的老师，怎么不守纪律。”
    电业局一个工人同三个学生争辩了一个钟头，最后两个学生被说得哑口无言，一个学生觉悟了，他对工人说：“我支持你的意见”。
    一个学生曹大可辩不过一位四十多岁的家庭妇女卓洪哥，骂这个妇女“无耻”，这个妇女拖他到派出所评理，最后这个学生认识到了错误，向这位妇女表示道歉。
    一个南京大学学生责问群众为什么要撕标语，群众反问：“你说贴得对不对”！学生只得说：“不对”，群众说：“贴得不对，撕得就对”，许多群众并责令贴大字报的学生亲手撕去，群众拍手欢迎这些学生和一群小朋友撕去了他们所贴的大字报。
    第二天又有几个学生偷偷地到报社门口去贴大字报，又被群众包围。贴大字报的学生见势不妙，偷偷地拿下南大校徽，碰壁而归。
    二十条反动纲领被驳得体无完肤
    右派分子的言论虽然一时迷惑了一部分群众，但不久就受到了四面八方的围攻。右派分子雷戡的反动的“二十条纲领”一贴出来，就有人反驳。6月1日的一次辩论会上，雷戡的谬论被批驳得体无完肤。第一个发言的人反驳雷戡所谓“力争自由民主”的谬论。他说：“我们已经生活在社会主义民主自由中，我们是人民的大学生，享受大学生应享受的自由，党提出百家争鸣，学校内部又开放了自由论坛和支持我们贴大字报，难道这些不是民主自由吗？”发言者接着说：“雷戡要求‘民革与中共平等’，如果说是长期共存，互相监督，共产党是已经给予民主党派很高的平等权利了。如果是指领导权问题，那么，中华人民共和国宪法规定了中国共产党的领导地位，民革的成员也是举手同意了的。”他又说：“雷戡反对把马列主义当必修课，我认为绝大多数青年和各民主党派都不会同意的。人民的大学生不是糊涂虫，他们要求改造自己的思想，把马列主义作为必修课，正是为了更好地改造思想，为人民服务。雷戡说，反对党团特权，如果是反对某些党员的特权思想，我是同意的，但如果一般地反对权威，反对党的领导，那么他就是主张无政府主义。”
    在真理面前，谎言和谬论是站不住脚的。经过几次辩论会，雷戡最后不得不承认了自己的错误。右派分子刘敬坤低头了
    6月8日起人民日报连续发表了好几篇激动人心的社论后，南京大学师生反右派斗争的意志更加坚决了。
    7月1日、2日的全校五千多人的集会上，历史系教员蒋钻放、祖庆年、党委会濮齐恒等人揭发了右派分子刘敬坤的反动言论：刘曾对历史系的党员说：党的高级干部，包括中央某些领导同志，已开始腐化了，不再革命了，因此，他要另外成立“党中央”，由他自己当
  “主席”。刘敬坤认为“国民党办了好事，发展了生产力”，因此他要写“中华民国史”，做“中华民国史专家”，他曾对历史系某教授表示，想到香港去当共产党的“批评家”，写一本“我所认识的中国共产党”，要揭露党的“黑暗”。
    许多教授听了揭发材料后深为震骇。历史系主任韩儒林用亲身的经历驳斥了刘敬坤的谬论。韩儒林在前中央大学执教五年，身为法学院院长，因贫病交迫，加上教学工作紧张，常常吐血。韩儒林教授提起往事，不觉泪下。他说这就是刘敬坤所谓国民党的“黄金时代”。韩儒林教授又说：“解放后我的生活起了根本变化，思想开朗了，精神也愉快了，受到了国家空前未有的尊重和爱护。”蒋孟引教授说他是1928年考入中央大学的，他历述了二十年间目睹许多师生受国民党迫害的事实，驳斥了国民党经营中央大学二十年有成绩的谬论。南大副校长李方训也以五年来南大制编了一百种教材，在今年的科学研究报告会上发表了一百二十篇论文，培养了三千一百多个毕业生的事实，驳斥刘敬坤所谓南京大学“破落了”的谬论。在铁的事实面前，刘敬坤也不得不低头了。
    在另外几次全校性的群众大会上，右派分子刘地生、汪云辉的错误言论也受到了致命的打击。
    这还只是初步胜利
    目前南京大学反右派斗争刚开始深入。直到现在为止，还有人在写匿名信，还有人在背后干肮脏的勾当；有的右派分子还没有受到应有的反击。如右派分子林文铮是民革成员，他发表了许多反动言论，用心恶毒，可是民革南大支部并没有对他的言论进行有力的批评，表现了姑息养奸的态度。
    7月5日，南京大学三千三百零二名同学签名的“致全省人民和同学的一封信”上说：“现在我们的反右派斗争已取得初步胜利，但还没有得到最后的胜利。一些右派分子还没有真正低头认罪，有的还在公开抗拒，有的则还隐藏着、蜷伏着。因此，我们还要继续斗争下去，不获全胜，决不收兵。”
