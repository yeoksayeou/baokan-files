Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 24th. Vietnamese Deputy Minister of National Defense Ta Quang Buu, at a press conference today, accused the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime of sabotaging the Geneva Accords and obstructing the reunification of Vietnam. He stated that the U.S. government, as one of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, must cease its interference in South Vietnam and halt its activities aimed at undermining the Geneva Accords.

The Vietnamese General, who represented the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army in signing the Geneva ceasefire agreement in July 1954, said that facts over the past three years have proven that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its agents lies in the long-term division of Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base, in order to re-ignite the war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

He said that under the instigation and assistance of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese authorities are more blatantly violating the Geneva Accords. Until now, the South Vietnamese authorities have not responded to the proposal put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the holding of consultative conferences to discuss the realization of national reunification through general elections.

Ta Quang Buu accused the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities of violating the military provisions of the Geneva Accords and adopting a policy of expanding military strength. He said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been continuously reducing defense expenditures since the restoration of peace. Currently, the military expenditure of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam accounts for only 22% of the 1957 national budget; at the same time, 80,000 soldiers have been demobilized, and other soldiers will continue to be demobilized. However, according to official figures, South Vietnam's "defense" expenditure has increased to 47% in the 1957 budget. The number of U.S. military missions in South Vietnam has increased to several thousand, and they now effectively command South Vietnam's defense and military departments. Many military airports and naval ports are being expanded. The United States is also constantly transporting war materials into South Vietnam. In addition, South Vietnam's ties with the U.S.-led Southeast Asia aggressive bloc are becoming increasingly close.

Ta Quang Buu pointed out that in order to cover up the sabotage activities of the U.S. and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and further realize their conspiracy, the South Vietnamese authorities are trying their best to obstruct the activities of the International Commission and refuse to send representatives to participate in the Joint Ceasefire Commission, bringing the activities of this committee to a standstill for more than a year. The South Vietnamese authorities have also adopted means of armed suppression against the patriotic people of South Vietnam, and recently declared Article 14C, which guarantees the democratic and free rights of the South Vietnamese people in the Geneva Accords, invalid.

Ta Quang Buu said that for the past three years, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again declares that it will continue to respect and strictly implement the Geneva Accords, and at the same time, demands that the parties concerned do the same in order to consolidate peace and realize the reunification of Vietnam. Ta Quang Buu requested that the South Vietnamese authorities respect and correctly implement the Geneva Accords, ensure the normal activities of the International Commission and the Joint Ceasefire Commission, and accept the proposal put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the holding of consultative conferences between North and South Vietnam to discuss the issue of general elections.

    越南国防部副部长谢光宝
    斥美吴破坏日内瓦协议
    新华社河内24日电　越南国防部副部长谢光宝今天在记者招待会上指责美国和吴庭艳政权破坏日内瓦协议和阻碍越南的统一。他说，美国政府作为日内瓦会议的参加国之一，必须停止干涉南越和停止破坏日内瓦协议的活动。
    这位曾经在1954年7月代表越南人民军总司令部在日内瓦停战协议上签字的越南将军说，三年来的事实证明，美帝国主义及其代理人的阴谋是在于长期分裂越南，把南越变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，以便在印度支那和东南亚重新发动战争。
    他说南越当局在美帝国主义的指使和帮助下，正在更加露骨地破坏日内瓦协议。直到现在，南越当局还没有答复越南民主共和国政府提出的关于举行协商会议来讨论通过进行普选来实现国家统一的建议。
    谢光宝指责美国和吴庭艳当局违反日内瓦协议有关军事的条款和采取扩充军事力量的政策。他说，越南民主共和国政府从和平恢复以后，即不断地减少国防费用。目前越南民主共和国的军事开支只占1957年度国家预算的22％；同时已经有八万军人复员，并且将继续让其他军人复员。但是根据官方数字，南越的“国防”费用在1957年的预算中却增加到47％。美国在南越的军事代表团人数已经增加到几千人，他们现在实际上指挥着南越的国防和军事部门。许多军用机场和军港正在扩大。美国还不断地把战争物资运入南越。此外，南越同以美国为首的东南亚侵略集团的联系也日益密切。
    谢光宝指出，为了掩盖美国和吴庭艳集团的破坏活动以进一步实现他们的阴谋，南越当局竭力设法阻挠国际委员会的活动，并且拒绝派代表参加联合停战委员会，使这个委员会的活动在一年多以来陷于停顿。南越当局还对南越的爱国人民采取武装镇压的手段，最近又宣布日内瓦协定中保证南越人民民主自由权利的十四条丙款无效。
    谢光宝说，三年来，越南民主共和国政府一贯尊重和严格履行日内瓦协议。越南民主共和国政府再次宣布它将继续尊重和严格执行日内瓦协议，同时要求有关方面也这样做，以巩固和平和实现越南的统一。谢光宝要求南越当局尊重和正确执行日内瓦协议，保证国际委员会和联合停战委员会的正常活动，并且接受越南民主共和国政府提出的关于越南北南两方举行协商会议来讨论普选问题的建议。
