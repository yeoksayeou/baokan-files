Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The fourth session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary meeting this afternoon.

The representatives who spoke at the meeting today unanimously refuted and exposed the various anti-socialist fallacies and conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists. They solemnly warned the bourgeois rightists: only by repenting and thoroughly confessing to the people can they find a way out; if they persist in their reactionary stance and continue to oppose and undermine the socialist cause, they will isolate themselves from the people.

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the rightists' attempt to oppose socialism is doomed to failure. The rightists attempted to use some intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen to carry out their criminal anti-socialist activities. Zhang Naiqi attempted to use the negative aspects of the industrial and commercial circles to bewilder them. Chen Shutong pointed out that the vast majority of intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen wholeheartedly trust the leadership of the Communist Party and are determined to take the socialist road, even if a few people are bewitched by them. Those who have been temporarily bewitched by the rightists will also wake up in the anti-rightist struggle, return to the side of the people, and fight against the rightists.

Chen Shutong said that we must thoroughly counterattack and fight to the end those rightists who resolutely oppose the Party and oppose socialism.

Cheng Qian, Governor of Hunan Province, mocked the reaction and stupidity of the bourgeois rightists in his speech, saying that the rightists are "nothing more than some dizzy-headed Quixoticists." The rightists secretly assumed that the Communist Party advocated the peaceful transformation of industrialists and businessmen and the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. If the rightists' anti-socialist words and deeds were exposed and refuted, it seemed that it would have a bad influence internationally and would create more concerns among the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan. Therefore, they were confident that the Communist Party and the people of the whole country could do nothing about them. Cheng Qian refuted these erroneous ideas, believing that their logic was foolish and that they had racked their brains hoping to "avoid hitting the rat for fear of breaking the dishes." He said that the Chinese people would never relax the anti-rightist struggle.

Cheng Qian also talked about the direction of the democratic parties in the anti-rightist struggle. He said that some people in the democratic parties who have usurped important positions want to overthrow the Communist Party and replace it. This is not only a challenge to their own political morality, but also makes people wonder whether such democratic parties still have the need to exist. He called on all patriotic and people-loving people in the democratic parties not to remain silent at such a critical juncture and not to allow a few rightists to tarnish the democratic parties. He believes that through the rectification movement centered on the anti-rightist struggle, the democratic parties will surely eliminate corruption and promote new ideas, and gain vigorous vitality.

Cheng Qian also repeatedly emphasized the need to strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party with all our strength. He said that shaking the leadership of the Communist Party would shake the cornerstone of socialism and shake the foundation of our country.

Deng Chumin, Deputy Governor of Shanxi Province, believes that the anti-rightist struggle is a fierce class struggle. He said that one end of this class struggle is domestic, and the other end has developed abroad. The Hong Kong imperialist newspapers and the like of Dulles are already "cheering" for the words and deeds of the rightists. Deng Chumin warned the bourgeois rightists, especially the rightist intellectuals, that they must recognize the future and control their own destiny. He said that those who can bow their heads before the truth and surrender before the people are still heroes. People's political life is more precious than natural life. Whether the political life of the bourgeois rightists can be maintained in the end is in their own hands.

Peng Dixian, President of Sichuan University, spoke on behalf of himself and Zeng Shufan, Liu Chengzhao, and Liu Lanqi, and detailed the various conspiracies carried out by the rightists of the China Democratic League in Sichuan. Peng Dixian said that Sichuan is a large province with many intellectuals and is the "birthplace of the China Democratic League." Therefore, the Zhang-Luo alliance has always regarded Sichuan as a "base" and carried out many conspiracies of "calling the wind and summoning the rain, and pushing the waves."

Peng Dixian hopes that in this political storm set off by the Zhang-Luo alliance, some people with unstable positions who have gone astray will quickly stand firm on the people's position, break away from the right-wing careerists ideologically, draw a clear line politically, and participate in the ranks of the anti-rightist struggle.

Writers Li Jieren and Sha Ting spoke jointly. They talked about the criticism of the anti-socialist work "Caomu Pian" in literary and art circles in Sichuan, and exposed the fact that Shanghai Wenhui Daily used this to publish sensational reports, attempting to ignite a fire in literary and art circles in Chengdu. They pointed out that the Wenhui Daily editorial department's explanation of this issue is still far from enough, and it still wants to exonerate the Wenhui Daily reporter who directly carried out this task of setting fire, which is not good. They hope that Wenhui Daily can have a better explanation and a better self-criticism.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that at the beginning of last year, industrialists and businessmen all over the country showed enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation. The broad masses of workers across the country did not care about their past exploitation and warmly welcomed this performance of the industrialists and businessmen, treating them as friends and agreeing to give them the necessary care in work and life, and supporting the government's measures to extend the term of fixed interest to the second five-year plan period. The reason why the workers and masses did this was to realize socialist transformation more smoothly and carry out socialist construction more smoothly. It is true that the majority of the bourgeoisie accepted this kindness. However, the bourgeois rightists harbored a full of hatred, and according to their long-planned conspiracy, launched a rampant attack on the working class. Lai Ruoyu said that we always welcome industrialists and businessmen who continue to show positive performance in socialist transformation, but we must resolutely fight back against the bourgeois rightists and the bourgeois restoration movement.

Xiong Kewu, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that only the Chinese Communist Party can save the people from fire and water and lead the country to prosperity and strength. This has been proved time and time again by the history of the Chinese revolution. However, there are a group of bourgeois rightists with ulterior motives who vainly attempt to drag the democratic parties away from the socialist track and compete with the party of the working class for leadership. As representatives of the National People's Congress, they specialize in saying anti-people words and doing anti-people things. He said that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has decided to conduct a rectification movement within the entire party, determined to conduct a resolute and ruthless struggle against these rightists, and will not stop until complete victory is achieved, so that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang will more resolutely take the socialist road under the leadership and supervision of the Chinese Communist Party.

Li Zhimin, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said that when the Chinese People's Volunteers persisted in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea for seven years as one day, and guarded the peace of Korea and the security of the motherland vigilantly together with the Korean people, when the soldiers guarding the "38th parallel" watched the great achievements of the motherland's socialist revolution and socialist construction with joy and excitement, suddenly saw a dark cloud appearing in the clear sky of the motherland. The bourgeois rightists took advantage of the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification to shamelessly launch a rampant attack. They vainly attempted to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and lead the motherland to the capitalist road spurned by the people of the whole country. Li Zhimin said that the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed extreme anger at the reactionary behavior of the rightists!

Li Zhimin solemnly refuted the rightists' rumors and slanders against the Communist Party and the socialist system, and the conspiracy to undermine Sino-Soviet solidarity with the vivid facts of the Chinese People's Volunteers' resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea.

Li Zhimin said that the tense, acute, and complex struggle is continuing on the "38th parallel." Recently, the US aggressors openly announced that they would transport new weapons into South Korea, preparing to turn South Korea into a base for atomic warfare, seriously undermining the armistice agreement. Li Zhimin said that the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely support the statements of the Chinese and Korean governments protesting the US destruction of the Korean armistice agreement. If the enemy dares to extend its claws, we will resolutely chop them off! Li Zhimin pointed out that the socialist road, the leadership of the Communist Party, and internationalist unity are the fundamental guarantees for us to smash the imperialist war of aggression. We will never allow the rightists to destroy it!

Sheng Pihua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, criticized Zhang Naiqi's absurd remarks and examined his own erroneous ideas. He said that at that time, he had a certain degree of sympathy for some of Zhang Naiqi's views. After Zhang Naiqi published the fallacy that fixed interest is not exploitation, he once said that fixed interest was taken out by the working class, and it can also be said that the working class gave it to the bourgeoisie as a gift, because the bourgeoisie handed over the enterprise. Now, upon examination, this statement is also wrong.

Yuan Xing, a model agricultural laborer in Hebei, introduced the tremendous changes in the lives of the peasants in his hometown, Heinao Village, Shahe County. The mountains around their village are full of barren hills. In the past, because there was no water source, the people who lived there had never had enough water to drink or washed their faces clean for generations. The whole village had never raised a sheep or a pig. In famine years, the whole village had to flee famine in groups. But now, this small mountain village has changed greatly. The peasants have opened up flat roads in all directions by relying on collective strength; they have built a large water storage pool, eight small reservoirs, and forty-two wells; they have raised sixty-eight heads of livestock, more than seven hundred sheep, and more than one hundred pigs. In the past, each mu of land yielded ninety catties of grain, but now it yields an average of three hundred and twenty-five catties per mu. The peasants in the whole village have surplus grain in every household and savings deposits in every household.

Yuan Xing said that we who have suffered know better than anyone else how this change came about. The rightists want to abolish the leadership of the Party, oppose socialism, and want us to be slaves again. We will never agree to it.

A total of thirty-six representatives spoke at the meeting today, of whom twenty-two made written statements. The representatives who made written statements were Nie Guoqing, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province; Zhang Guofan, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin and President of Tianjin University; Zeng Zesheng, member of the National Defense Commission; Yu Deyuan, Vice President of Northeast Institute of Geology; Ma Leting, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Division of the Department of Civil Affairs of Anhui Province; and sixteen representatives engaged in medical education and medical science research, Shen Kefei, Zhu Xianyi, Ke Lin, Zhang Yan, Wang Shuzhen, Wu Yingkai, Yu Aifeng, Zhu Futang, Shi Zenghong, He Bihui, Xu Zuoxia, Huang Jiasi, Liu Chengzhao, Lin Qiaozhi, Liang Boqiang, and Zhang Yangfen; as well as Gao Fengqin, a family member of a worker in Liaoning.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Saifuddin, Ye Jianying, Ma Xulun, Wu Yaozong, Chen Shaokuan, Han Wangchen, Yang Zhihua, Xiao Longyou, and Luo Shifa.

Today's afternoon meeting started at 3:00 PM and ended at 6:45 PM.

    真心悔改　彻底交代　才有出路！
    人民代表警告右派不要自绝于人民
    新华社8日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。
    今天在会上发言的代表，同声驳斥和揭露了资产阶级右派分子的各种反社会主义的谬论和阴谋活动，他们严正地警告资产阶级右派分子：只有幡然悔改，彻底向人民交代，才有出路；如果坚持反动立场，继续反对和破坏社会主义事业，那就将自绝于人民。
    全国工商联主任委员陈叔通说，右派分子反对社会主义的企图是注定要失败的。右派分子企图利用一部分知识分子和工商界来进行反社会主义的罪恶活动。章乃器就企图利用工商界消极的一面来蛊惑工商界。陈叔通指出，要知道，知识分子和工商界纵然有少数人受他们的蛊惑，可是绝大多数知识分子和工商界是衷心地信赖共产党的领导的，是坚决要走社会主义的道路的。就是那些一时受到右派分子蛊惑的人，在反右派斗争中也会清醒过来，回到人民一边，对右派分子进行斗争的。
    陈叔通说，对那些坚决反对党、反对社会主义的右派分子，我们必须彻底地给予反击，斗争到底。
    湖南省省长程潜在发言中嘲笑资产阶级右派分子的反动和愚蠢，说右派分子“只不过是一些发昏十三章的狂想主义者”。右派分子曾暗自设想，以为共产党主张和平改造工商业者，主张和平解放台湾，如果对右派分子的反社会主义言行进行揭露驳斥，似乎就会在国际上产生不好的影响，会在台湾国民党军政人员中间产生更多的顾虑。因此他们满以为共产党和全国人民对他们无可奈何。程潜驳斥了这些错误想法，认为他们的逻辑是愚蠢的，他们煞费心机想望“投鼠忌器”，他说中国人民绝不会放松反右派的斗争。
    程潜又谈到在反右派斗争中民主党派的去向。他说，民主党派的某些窃据要津的人物，他们想搞垮共产党，想取而代之，这不仅仅是向自己的政治道德挑战，而且人们要怀疑这样的民主党派还有没有存在的必要。他呼吁所有民主党派中的为国为民的仁人志士，在这样一个节骨眼上，不能够保持缄默，不许少数右派分子玷污各民主党派。他认为通过以反右派斗争为中心的整风运动，各民主党派必将去腐催新，获得健壮的生命力。
    程潜还一再强调了要倾全力加强共产党的领导。他说，动摇了共产党的领导，就动摇了社会主义的基石，也就动摇了我国的国本。
    山西省副省长邓初民认为反右派斗争是一场激烈的阶级斗争。他说，这场阶级斗争战线的一端在国内，另一端已发展到国外，香港帝国主义报纸和杜勒斯之流，已经在为右派分子的言论行动“喝采”。邓初民警告资产阶级右派分子，特别是右派知识分子，必须认清前途，掌握自己的命运。他说，能在真理面前低头和在人民的面前投降的人，还是好汉。人的政治生命比自然生命更为宝贵，资产阶级右派分子的政治生命是否最终得以保持，其权操在他们自己手里。
    四川大学校长彭迪先代表他自己和曾庶凡、刘承钊、刘兰畦联合发言，详细地揭露了民盟右派分子在四川进行的各种阴谋活动。彭迪先说，四川是个大省，有不少知识分子，又是“民盟发祥地”。因此，章罗联盟一直把四川作为“据点”，进行了不少“呼风唤雨、推涛作浪”的阴谋活动。
    彭迪先希望，在这次章罗联盟所掀起的政治大风浪中，一些立场不稳、误入歧途的人，赶快站稳人民的立场，与右派野心家在思想上割断联系，在政治上划清界限，参加到反右派斗争的行列中来。
    作家李劼人、沙汀联合发言。他们谈了有关四川文艺界批判反社会主义的作品“草木篇”的情况，并且揭发了上海文汇报借此发表煽动性报道，企图在成都文艺界点火的事实。他们指出，文汇报编辑部对这一问题的交代还很不够，它还想为直接执行这个放火任务的文汇报记者开脱，这是没有好处的。他们希望文汇报能有更好的交代，更好的检查。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚说，去年年初，全国各地工商业者，曾经表现了接受社会主义改造的积极性。全国广大职工不计较他们过去的剥削，对于工商业者的这种表现给予了热情的欢迎，把他们当做朋友，同意在工作上和生活上给予他们必要的照顾，拥护政府把定息年限延长到第二个五年计划期间的措施。职工群众所以如此，是为了更顺利地实现社会主义改造，更顺利地进行社会主义建设。不错，资产阶级的大多数接受了这种好意。可是资产阶级右派却怀着满腔的仇恨，他们按照蓄意已久的阴谋，发动了对工人阶级的猖狂进攻。赖若愚说，我们对于在社会主义改造中继续表现积极的工商业者，无论什么时候都是欢迎的，可是对于资产阶级右派，对于资产阶级的复辟运动，就一定要予以坚决的回击。
    民革副主席熊克武说，只有中国共产党，才能拯斯民于水火，致国家于富强，这是为中国革命的历史所一次、再次证明了的。但是，却有那么一批别有用心的资产阶级右派分子，妄想把民主党派拖离社会主义的轨道，向工人阶级的政党争夺领导权。他们身为全国人民代表大会的代表，却专门说反人民的话，做反人民的事。他说，民革已经决定在全党范围内进行一次整风运动，决心同这些右派分子进行坚决无情的斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵，使民革在中国共产党的领导和监督之下，更坚决地走社会主义的道路。
    中国人民志愿军政治委员李志民说，当中国人民志愿军七年如一日地坚持抗美援朝斗争，与朝鲜人民在一起警惕地保卫着朝鲜的和平和祖国的安全的时候，当守卫在“三八线”上的战士们，以欢欣鼓舞的心情注视着祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就的时候，突然看到祖国晴朗的天空，出现了一片乌云，资产阶级右派分子利用共产党进行整风的机会，竟无耻地发动了猖狂的进攻，他们妄想取消共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，把祖国引向全国人民所唾弃的资本主义道路。李志民说，中国人民志愿军对于右派分子的反动行为表示极为愤怒！
    李志民以中国人民志愿军抗美援朝的活生生事实，严正地驳斥了右派分子对于共产党和社会主义制度的造谣污蔑，对于中苏团结的阴谋破坏。
    李志民说，在“三八线”上，紧张、尖锐、复杂的斗争在继续着。最近，美国侵略者又公然宣布把新式武器运入南朝鲜，准备把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地，严重破坏了停战协定。李志民表示，中国人民志愿军坚决拥护中、朝两国政府抗议美国破坏朝鲜停战协定的声明，如果敌人敢于伸进它的魔爪，就坚决斩断它！李志民指出，社会主义道路、共产党的领导和国际主义团结，是我们粉碎帝国主义侵略战争的根本保证，右派分子想破坏它，我们坚决不允许！
    上海市副市长盛丕华对于章乃器的荒谬言论作了批判，并检查了他自己的错误思想。他说，当时他对章乃器某些地方有一定的同情，在章乃器发表定息不是剥削的谬论后，他曾说定息是工人阶级拿出来的，也可以说工人阶级对资产阶级赠与，因为资产阶级交出了企业。现在检查，这话也是错误的。
    河北农业劳动模范元兴介绍了他的家乡——沙河县黑碯村农民生活的巨大变化。他们村周围遍地是荒山。过去因为没有水源，住在那里的人世世辈辈都没喝够水，没洗干净过脸。全村从来没有养起一只羊，一口猪。赶上荒年，全村还要成群结队地出外逃荒。可是现在，这个小山村大大变了样。农民靠着集体力量开辟了四通八达的平坦道路；修成了一个大型积水池、八个小水库、四十二眼井；饲养着六十八头牲口、七百多只羊、一百多口猪。过去每亩地收九十斤粮食，现在平均每亩收三百二十五斤。全村的农民是家家有余粮，户户都存款。
    元兴说，我们受过苦的人，比谁都清楚这个变化是怎么来的。右派分子想取消党的领导，想反对社会主义，想要我们再作奴隶，我们坚决不答应。
    今天在大会上发言的代表共有三十六人，其中有二十二人作了书面发言。书面发言的代表是湖北省副省长聂国青，天津市副市长、天津大学校长张国藩，国防委员会委员曾泽生和东北地质学院副院长喻德渊，安徽省民政厅民族事务处副处长马乐庭，从事医学教育和医学科学研究工作的十六位代表沈克非、朱宪彝、柯麟、张岩、王淑贞、吴英恺、俞霭峰、诸福棠、石增荣、何碧辉、徐佐夏、黄家驷、刘承钊、林巧稚、梁伯强和章央芬，以及辽宁职工家属高凤琴。
    今天大会执行主席是：赛福鼎、叶剑英、马叙伦、吴耀宗、陈绍宽、韩望尘、杨之华、萧龙友、罗世发。
    今天下午的会议从三时开始，到六时三刻结束。
