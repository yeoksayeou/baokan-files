Allow me to offer some opinions on the development of China's hydropower construction.

Hydropower Stations Completed One After Another, Equipment Capacity More Than Doubles in Five Years

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the young hydropower construction industry has experienced vigorous development and achieved certain successes in recent years. From 1953 to the present, the total installed capacity of newly built and renovated hydropower stations is nearly 500,000 kilowatts (the total installed capacity of newly built hydro and thermal power is 2 million kilowatts). If we calculate to the end of this year, that is, in the first Five-Year Plan, the total capacity of new hydropower stations will reach 600,000 kilowatts. These include the renovation project of Fengman in Northeast China, Guanting and Moshikou near the capital, Shizitan and Shangdong in Sichuan, Gutian in Fujian, Shangyou in Jiangxi, Urumqi in Xinjiang, Shilongba in Yunnan, and Foziling in Anhui. This is more than double the total installed capacity of hydropower stations of just over 170,000 kilowatts in 1952. All these hydropower stations were designed and constructed by Chinese technicians with the assistance of Soviet experts, and all the new hydropower stations are equipped with domestically produced machinery and equipment. The manufacturing capacity of hydropower generating units has increased from 3,000 kilowatts to 15,000 kilowatts. Currently under construction are the Liuxihe in Guangdong, the Dahuo in Fushun and other medium-sized hydropower stations, as well as the Sanmenxia, Xin'anjiang, Yi Li River and other large and high-head hydropower stations. They will be completed successively during the second Five-Year Plan period. In addition, a number of hydropower stations are in the design and planning stages. The motor manufacturing department is rushing to produce 72,500-kilowatt large-scale hydro-turbine generators, and the designed unit capacity has exceeded 100,000 kilowatts. From the perspective of electricity generated by hydropower stations nationwide, the annual electricity generation of hydropower stations in 1952 was 1.76 billion kilowatt-hours (including Fengman, the total annual electricity generation of hydro and thermal power stations was 7.26 billion kilowatt-hours), but the annual electricity generation of hydropower stations at the end of this year will reach 4.5 billion kilowatt-hours (including Fengman, the total annual electricity generation of hydro and thermal power stations will be 18.86 billion kilowatt-hours). This electricity is produced by water power, and the cost is very low. Producing 4.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity with hydropower can save more than 100 million yuan per year compared to thermal power stations. At the same time, hydropower stations have large reservoirs, which also have flood control and irrigation benefits.

The achievement of these successes is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. In the decades of Kuomintang rule, the total hydropower stations in China, excluding the Northeast, did not even reach 10,000 kilowatts. I have been engaged in hydropower work since 1938. In the fifteen years until 1953, I only participated in the construction of the Fengman Hydropower Station. However, from 1954 to the present, in just three short years, I have participated in the survey and design work of no less than twenty hydropower stations. As an engineering and technical personnel, my only hope is that the Party can lead us to build more hydropower stations. The greatest happiness I feel is seeing the socialist cause develop vigorously year after year. Some people said in the rectification campaign that our achievements are not the main thing and that the socialist system is not good. This is really closing their eyes and refusing to look at the sun. I resolutely cannot agree.

Now I would like to focus on the urgent need for comprehensive utilization of reservoirs and development of hydropower construction in the Northeast region.

During this inspection, I listened to the opinions of relevant parties and conducted some research (see the inspection report for details) on the flood disasters in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, the development prospects of industrial electricity in the Northeast, and how to rationally arrange the construction of large-scale comprehensive utilization reservoirs and hydropower stations in the future. I also participated in the aerial inspection of the Songhua River basin planning in June. I feel that the following issues must be taken seriously.

Construction of Hongshila Hydropower Station to Eradicate Floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces

Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces suffered from floods in the Songhua River last year, and grain production was reduced. Some people thought that this was caused by the release of water from the Fengman Reservoir. In fact, this is not the case. On the contrary, the Fengman Reservoir played a certain role in flood regulation and reduced the impact of the flood. However, to fundamentally solve the flood problem, as pointed out in the flood control measures of the Songhua River Basin Planning Conference, in the long term, more than ten flood storage reservoirs must be built on the main tributaries of the Nen River, Lafa River, Yinma River, and the Second Songhua River, and a large number of embankments must be built on the main tributaries of the Songhua River. In addition, a number of flood diversion areas should be opened up in the low-lying areas of the Nen River basin to effectively eliminate the harm of extraordinarily large floods to the downstream. It can be seen that it is impossible for the Fengman Reservoir to bear this huge task alone. In order to quickly and effectively reduce the flood flow of the Second Songhua River and meet the industrial electricity demand in the Northeast, it is recommended that the planning department consider the construction of the Hongshila Hydropower Station, a large-scale comprehensive utilization reservoir upstream of Fengman.

Combine Agricultural Development Planning and Arrange Electric Power Industry Construction

According to the information provided by Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces and the Shenyang Electric Power Administration, the electricity load in the Northeast in the next few years will be very tight. In the second Five-Year Plan, there will still be a shortage of more than one million kilowatts of electrical equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to properly consider the capital construction of the electric power industry, which also requires careful consideration of the investment allocation between hydro and thermal power. More importantly, when arranging the electric power industry, a heavy industry, it is necessary to consider it in conjunction with the development of agriculture. Chairman Mao taught us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "...the fact that heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market has not yet been clearly seen by people. However, with the gradual development of agricultural technical reforms and the increasing modernization of agriculture, machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, electric power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, civilian building materials, etc. serving agriculture will increase day by day. The situation that heavy industry takes agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people...." In addition to power generation, the construction of comprehensive hydraulic hubs in the Northeast can directly bring flood control and irrigation benefits to agriculture, reduce droughts and floods, and use the low cost of hydroelectric power to produce chemical fertilizers in large quantities for agricultural use, which will further promote agricultural harvest. Therefore, in terms of combining agricultural development, building hydropower stations has more advantages than building thermal power stations.

If the shortage of more than one million kilowatts of electricity in the Northeast is solved solely by thermal power, it will consume about 5 million tons of coal each year, which will not only increase the investment in national coal mine construction and railway transportation, but also directly conflict with the coal production and supply plan. Since the equipment for thermal power plants needs to be ordered from abroad, it will increase the country's foreign exchange expenditure. The cost of products for industries that use a lot of electricity (such as nitrogen fertilizer, electrochemistry, metallurgy, etc.) cannot be reduced. Building hydropower stations can eliminate these difficulties. Therefore, rationally arranging hydropower construction is in line with the country's current and long-term interests.

Northeast Has Abundant Hydropower Resources and Can Build More Hydropower Stations

In the past, some people believed that the investment per kilowatt in thermal power stations was lower than that in hydropower, and the capital turnover was faster, so they always preferred to consider thermal power. Hydropower in many countries is indeed much more expensive than thermal power, but this conclusion does not apply to China. Due to China's favorable terrain and geology, abundant labor, and other characteristics, hydropower investment is very low. According to the actual statistics of hydropower construction in recent years, the investment per kilowatt in hydropower is not much different from that of thermal power stations with the same capacity, and some are exactly the same. From the perspective of correctly resolving current and long-term interests, even if hydropower investment is higher, it should not be considered solely from the perspective of investment per kilowatt. We should also consider the cost of electricity, and study and determine it based on the economic benefits of the investment, the repayment period, and the country's long-term interests. According to calculations, the cost of generating electricity from hydropower stations is only one-sixth to one-seventh of that of thermal power stations. The extra investment spent on building a hydropower station can be recovered from the savings in operating costs in about three years after it is put into operation. A hydropower station will operate for decades, which is worthwhile. It is also necessary for comrades in the planning department to consider building more thermal power stations in order to meet the load requirements as soon as possible from the perspective of the country's current investment capacity. However, in the past, because there was no domestic data available for research, not enough consideration was given to hydropower development.

The Northeast region needs to vigorously develop hydropower, and thermal power must also be built. A power system with both hydro and thermal power stations has proven that only a power system with most hydro and thermal power stations operating in parallel can obtain the most economical and reliable power supply, and can complement each other and maximize the characteristics of hydro and thermal power stations. For the specific region of the Northeast, emphasizing the necessity of building hydropower is more important because it is an important industrial base. According to the distribution of power resources, it should be said that the situation of the system becoming "water-oriented and fire-followed" is the most economical and reasonable.

Among the hydropower resources of the rivers in the Northeast, there are currently the Huanren and Shajianzi on the Hun River, the Yunfeng on the Yalu River, and the Hongshila on the Second Songhua River, as well as some medium and small-sized hydropower stations, which have the advantages of low investment per kilowatt and comprehensive utilization effects, and have mastered certain design data. This is for the national planning department to refer to, hoping to conduct research and consider including two or three of these hydropower stations in the second Five-Year Plan.

Incidentally, it is suggested that the planning department conduct in-depth research on the investment sharing of comprehensive utilization projects and the repayment period of hydropower station investment. The reservoir of a hydropower station has comprehensive utilization benefits, and is often built for comprehensive utilization requirements. For example, the railway required for the construction of a hydropower station is often needed by other industrial departments. Therefore, its investment should be borne jointly by the relevant departments according to the size of the comprehensive benefits, and should not be borne entirely by the power station construction department, in order to increase the investment per kilowatt of the hydropower station.

Hydropower construction can be said to be a new undertaking in our country. New things especially need the concern and support of all parties. It is hoped that the national planning department and the personnel department will give sufficient support to the hydropower cause.

Please consider and study whether the above opinions are feasible.

    右派分子闭着眼睛不看太阳
    于开泉用我国电力发展的事实斥右派否认建设成绩的谬论
    请允许我就我国水力发电建设事业的发展问题发表一点意见。
    水电站一个接一个建成设备容量五年增长两倍多
    在中国共产党的领导下，几年来年轻的水力发电建设事业有了蓬勃的发展，取得了一定的成绩。从一九五三年到目前已完成的新建和改建水电站总设备容量将近五十万瓩（新建水、火电力总设备容量二百万瓩），如果计算到今年年底，亦即在第一个五年计划里新的水电站总容量将达到六十万瓩。其中有东北丰满的改建工程，首都附近的官厅、模式口，四川的狮子滩、上硐，福建的古田，江西的上犹，新疆的乌拉泊，云南的石龙坝，安徽的佛子岭等水电站。这比一九五二年仅有的十七万多瓩的水电站总设备容量增长了二倍多。这些水电站全部是我国技术人员在苏联专家的帮助下，自己设计和施工的，所有的新建水电站都是用国内自制的机器设备来装备的。水力发电机组制造能力已由三千瓩增至一万五千瓩了。现在正在施工的水电站除广东的流溪河、抚顺的大伙房等中型水电站外，还有三门峡、新安江、以礼河等大型和高水头水电站。它们将在第二个五年计划期内陆续建成。另外还有一批水电站在设计和计划中。电机制造部门正在赶制七万二千五百瓩的大型水轮发电机，设计中的机组容量已超过十万瓩了。从全国水电站生产的电量来看，一九五二年水电站的年发电量为十七亿六千万度。（包括水丰，水火电站总年发电量七十二亿六千万度），但今年年底的水电站年发电量将会达到四十五亿度（包括水丰，水火电站总年发电量一百八十八亿六千万度）。这些电能是用水力来生产的，成本很低，比火电站生产四十五亿电能每年可节省一亿多元，同时水电站因有大蓄水库，还具有防洪灌溉等效益。
    这些成绩的取得是同共产党的领导分不开的。在国民党统治的几十年内，除东北外，中国的水电站总共还不到一万瓩。我自一九三八年从事水电工作，到一九五三年的十五年间，只参加了一个丰满水电站的建设，但从一九五四年到现在的短短三年中，参加了不下二十余个水电站的勘测设计工作，作为一个工程技术人员，我唯一的希望就是党能领导我们建设出更多的水电站，我所感到的最大幸福是年复一年地看到社会主义事业蓬勃地发展。有人在整风中说我们的成绩不是主要的，社会主义制度不好，这真是闭着眼睛不看太阳，我坚决不能同意。
    现在我想着重谈一下东北地区迫切需要综合利用水库和发展水电建设的问题。
    这次视察中，我就吉林和黑龙江两省的洪水灾害和东北工业用电发展远景以及今后如何合理地安排大型综合利用水库和水电站建设的问题，听取了有关方面的意见并作了一些研究（详见视察报告）。又参加了六月份松花江流域规划的空中视察工作。我感到下列问题必须引起重视。
    修建红石砬子水电站根除吉黑两省水灾
    吉林和黑龙江两省去年曾受到松花江的洪水灾害，粮食减产。有人以为这是由于丰满水库放水所造成的，其实并不是这样，相反的，由于丰满水库起了一定的调洪作用，减轻了水灾。但是要根本解决洪水问题，正如这次松花江流域规划会议的防洪措施所指出的，在远景中必须在嫩江的主支流，拉法河、饮马河、第二松花江等修建十余个蓄洪水库和在松花江本支流上修建大量堤防，并在嫩江流域的低洼地区开辟若干分洪区，才能有效地消除特大洪水对下游的危害。由此可见这个庞大的任务要求丰满水库单独负担，是决不可能的。为了迅速地有效地减小第二松花江的洪水流量及满足东北工业用电要求，建议计划部门考虑丰满上游大型综合利用水库——红石砬子水电站的修建问题。
      结合农业发展规划
      安排电力工业建设
    根据吉林、黑龙江两省及沈阳电业管理局提供的资料，东北今后几年内的电力负荷是非常紧张的，在第二个五年计划里还缺一百多万瓩的电力设备。因此，必须妥善地考虑电力工业的基本建设，这也就要求同时认真地考虑水火电的投资分配。更重要的是在安排电力工业这一重工业时，必须结合农业的发展统一考虑。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中教导我们“……重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，目前还没有使人们看得清楚，但是随着农业的技术改革逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。……”在东北建设综合水力枢纽除发电外，能直接为农业带来防洪和灌溉的效益减少涝、旱灾害，能利用低廉的水电成本生产农业上大量需用的化学肥料，将更能促进农业上的丰收，因此在结合农业发展的问题上建设水电站要比建设火电站的优越性多。
    东北所缺的一百多万瓩电力若单独用火电解决，则每年要耗煤约五百万吨，这样不仅增加国家煤矿建设和铁道运输的投资，而且直接与煤炭生产供应计划发生矛盾。由于火电厂的设备需向国外订货，因而就会增加国家的外汇支出。对于大量用电的工业（如氮肥、电气化学、冶金等）产品的成本也就无法降低。建设水电站却可以排除这些困难。因此，合理地安排水电建设是符合国家当前利益与长远利益的。
      东北水力资源丰富
      可多建设些水电站
    过去有人认为火电站每瓩的投资比水电低，资金周转快，因而总是偏重考虑火电。许多国家的水电确是比火电贵得多，但这个结论并不能适用于中国。我国由于地形地质有利、劳动力多等特点，水电投资是很低廉的。根据几年来水电建设的实际统计资料，水电每瓩的投资和同容量的火电站相差不多，有的完全相等。从正确解决当前利益与长远利益的观点出发，即使水电投资较高，也不应单从每瓩投资多少这一个观点出发，还应考虑到电能成本，根据投资的经济效果，抵偿年限和国家长远利益来研究确定。根据计算，水电站的发电成本仅等于火电站的六分之一到七分之一。水电站建设时多花的投资大约在投入运行后三年左右便可从节省的运行费用中收回。一个水电站要运转几十年，这是合算的。计划部门的同志从国家目前投资能力出发尽快地满足负荷要求，考虑多建设一些火电站也是必要的，但是过去因为国内还没有自己的资料可供研究，对水电发展是考虑不够的。
    东北地区需要大力发展水电，同样也必须建设火电。具有水火电站的动力系统已经证明只有在多数水火电站并列运行的动力系统才能获得最经济而可靠的电源，才可以互相取长补短，最大限度地发挥水火电站的特点。对于东北这一具体地区，更多的强调建设水电的必要性，是由于它是一个重要的工业基地，根据动力资源分布情况，应该说系统变成“水主火从”的形势才是最经济合理的。
    东北各河流的水力资源中，具有每瓩投资低的优点，和综合利用效果，而且已掌握了一定设计资料的开发对象，目前就有浑江上的桓仁、沙尖子，鸭绿江上的云峰，第二松花江上的红石砬子等大型和一些中小型水电站，这可供国家计划部门参考，希望进行研究，考虑将其中的二个或三个水电站列入第二个五年计划。
    附带建议计划部门深入地研究综合利用工程的投资分摊和水电站投资的抵偿年限问题。一个水电站的水库具有综合利用效益，也常因综合利用要求而修建，又如水电站施工所需的铁路也常为其他工业部门所需，因此其投资应按综合效益大小由有关部门共同担负，不宜全部由电站建设部门承担，以加大水电站的每瓩投资数。
    水电建设在我国还可说是一个新的事业，新生的事物特别需要各方面的关心和支持，希望国家计划部门以及人事部门对于水电事业给予足够的支持。
    以上意见是否可行，还请考虑研究。
