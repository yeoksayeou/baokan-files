Speaking of the Newly Staged Dance Dramas
Ding Ning
In the Beijing Dance School's practical performance held in early July this academic year, two Chinese dance dramas, "Zhang Yu and Qiong Lian" and "On the Miao Mountain," were performed, and the European dance drama (ballet) "La Fille Mal Gardée" will also be performed. The appearance of Chinese and foreign multi-act dance dramas in the dance school's third-year practical performance shows its rapid development.
The two dance dramas, "Zhang Yu and Qiong Lian" and "On the Miao Mountain," were rehearsed by the students of the Dance School's Choreography Training Class under the theoretical and practical guidance of the Soviet choreography expert Comrade Chaplin. They are all newly trained dance drama choreography talents.
The dance school has only been established for three years, and it has already trained a group of teachers, actors, and choreographers. These achievements could not have been achieved in the past.
Recently, some people have tried to write off the achievements of socialist construction in one stroke, attempting to deny that achievements are fundamental; however, the facts refute their fallacy. Looking at the development of dance art, the achievements of these few years are not only the most basic but also very significant. This is true not only from the perspective of the dance school but also from the perspective of the entire dance industry. Who can deny the fact that in these short eight years, the ranks of dance workers have grown so strong, and dance performances have developed so vigorously!
Before liberation, where did we have dance schools? Which of the professional dance troupes organized by famous dancers could survive for a long time? The vast majority of dance workers were cultivated and grew up in the few years after liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, by learning from traditional art, striving for artistic practice, and constantly strengthening foreign cultural exchanges. Now, we not only have dance schools dedicated to training dance talents, dozens of professional song and dance troupes, but also are experimenting with national dance dramas based on traditional dance. However, people can count: how many dance talents were cultivated before liberation?
If we take ballet as an example, it is also very clear. The performance of "La Fille Mal Gardée" is something to be excited about. Who has ever seen a ballet performed entirely by Chinese people before? It can definitely be said that this is the first time. People who have been engaged in ballet for several years in the past have not trained many ballet dancers, let alone perform a full-length ballet. In the short three years of the dance school, under the patient guidance of Soviet experts, this can be done, and a considerable number of actors, teachers, and a group of choreography talents with higher quality than in the past have been trained. Even from this small corner of change, can't it be affirmed that the achievements of socialist cultural construction are the main ones?

### 从新排的舞剧说起

    从新排的舞剧说起
    丁宁
    北京舞蹈学校在7月上旬举行的本学年实习公演里，演出了两个中国舞剧“张羽与琼莲”和“苗岭山上”，还将演出欧洲舞剧（芭蕾）“无益谨慎”。舞蹈学校在自己第三年度的实习演出中，出现了中国的和外国的多幕舞剧，它的发展是够迅速的了。
    “张羽与琼莲”和“苗岭山上”这两个舞剧都是舞蹈学校编导训练班的同学，在苏联编导专家查普林同志关于舞剧创作的理论与实际指导下进行排练的。他们都是新培养出来的舞剧编导人材。
    舞蹈学校成立只有三年，已经培养了一批教员、演员和编导，这些成绩是过去所不能达到的。
    最近，有些人想一笔抹煞社会主义建设的成绩，企图否定成绩是基本的；然而事实驳倒了他们的谬论。从舞蹈艺术的发展来看，这几年的成绩不仅是最最基本的，而且是非常显著的。不仅从舞蹈学校看是如此，而且从整个舞蹈事业来看更是如此。谁能否认在这短短的八年里，舞蹈工作者的队伍得到如此壮大，舞蹈演出得到蓬勃大发展这样的事实呢！
    解放前，我们何尝有过舞蹈学校？连那些由著名的舞蹈家举办的专业舞蹈团体，又有哪一个能够长期存在下去？绝大多数的舞蹈工作者都是在解放后的几年里，在党和政府的领导下，在向传统艺术学习，努力艺术实践，及不断加强对外文化交流中，培养和成长起来的。现在，我们不仅有了专门培养舞蹈人材的舞蹈学校，有了几十个专业的歌舞团体，而且还尝试着在传统舞蹈的基础上进行民族舞剧的实验。可是，人们却可以数得出：解放前到底培养了多少舞蹈人材？
    如果拿芭蕾来作例子，也是非常清楚的。“无益谨慎”的上演是值得我们兴奋的。从前谁能见过全部由中国人演出的芭蕾呢？肯定说这是第一次。过去搞了几年芭蕾的人，并没有培养出多少芭蕾演员来，更不可能演出整幕的芭蕾。在舞蹈学校的短短三年里，在苏联专家的耐心指导下，能做到这样，并且还培养了相当数量的，比过去质量更高的演员、教员和一批编导人材。即从这小小一个角落的变化，难道不也可以肯定地说社会主义的文化建设，成绩是主要的吗？
