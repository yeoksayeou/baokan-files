    U.S. Envoys' Primary Task: Interfering in the Internal Affairs of Host Countries
    Confession from New York's "Fortune" Magazine

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) New York's "Fortune" magazine published a series of three articles in its April, May, and June issues this year regarding the U.S. State Department, which blatantly admitted the activities of U.S. ambassadors stationed abroad in interfering in the internal affairs of their host countries.

    The article stated, "Since World War II, the importance of ambassadors has been increasing day by day." The first "task" of a U.S. ambassador stationed abroad is to interfere in the internal affairs of the host country "to represent the interests of the United States." The article said, "The diplomatic convention that 'diplomats should not interfere in internal affairs' is merely empty talk. The question today is not whether to interfere, but how to interfere."

    The article quoted former U.S. Ambassadors to Italy and France, Jefferson Caffery, as saying, "Any ambassador who does not interfere in the affairs of his host country is doing nothing." The article also stated, "Without the support of U.S. ambassadors, Magsaysay and Ngo Dinh Diem could not have become presidents or prime ministers."

    The article further described the "working methods" of U.S. ambassadors as "treating different types of countries differently." "If the government of the host country is a one-man dictatorship, the U.S. ambassador must first establish a good relationship with the ruler. In some special cases, the ambassador must participate in the struggle against political enemies and support 'friendly' successors - such as the ambassador to Guatemala's actions in overthrowing the Arbenz government in 1954." The method of dealing with countries that have "assumed obligations" is to "emphasize America's active anti-communist policy and exert as much pressure on them as possible." If a country has "not assumed obligations," the method is more subtle, using "emphasizing America's peaceful intentions and its desire to help emerging Asian countries" to achieve its goals.

    The article shamelessly praised the activities of former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, and U.S. Ambassador to Austria, Thompson, as "successful examples." Allison "privately decided with the Japanese government" to shelve the issue of Okinawa. And Thompson not only interfered in Austrian internal affairs, but also "played a direct commanding role in the Hungarian incident."

### 美国使节首要任务  干涉驻在国的内政  纽约“幸福”杂志的供状

    美国使节首要任务  干涉驻在国的内政
    纽约“幸福”杂志的供状
    本报讯　纽约“幸福”杂志在今年4、5、6月号连载了三篇有关美国国务院的文章，其中赤裸裸地承认了美国驻外使节干涉驻在国内政的活动。
    文章说：“自从二次大战以来，大使的重要性正在日益增加”。美国驻外大使的第一个“任务”，就是“代表美国的利益”干涉驻在国的内政。文章说：“所谓‘外交官不应干涉内政’的外交惯例，仅是一句空话。今天的问题不在于是否要进行干涉，而是怎样进行干涉。”
    文章引用前美国驻意大利和驻法国大使杰弗逊·卡弗里的话说：“任何大使如果他不去干涉驻在国的事务，他就等于没做工作。”文章还说：“麦格赛赛、吴庭艳如果没有美国大使的撑腰，就不可能当总统或总理。”
    文章进一步介绍了美国大使的“工作方法”，是“对不同类型的国家分别对待”。“假如驻在国政府是由一人独裁者，美国大使必须首先搞好和执政者的关系。在一些特殊情况下，大使必须参与反对政敌的斗争，支持‘友好’的继承者——如驻危地马拉的大使在1954年推翻阿本斯政权的做法。”对待“已承担义务”的国家，办法则是“强调美国积极反共的政策，并且尽一切可能向他们施加压力”。如果是“没有承担义务”的国家，方法就隐晦了，是用“强调美国的和平意图和它帮助亚洲新兴国家的愿望”来达到目的。
    文章中厚颜无耻地把美国前驻日大使艾利逊和驻奥地利大使汤普生的活动捧为“成功的例子”。艾利逊“和日本政府私下决定”把冲绳岛的问题搁置一边。而汤普生是不但干涉了奥地利内政，而且“他在匈牙利事件中直接充当指挥者的脚色”。
