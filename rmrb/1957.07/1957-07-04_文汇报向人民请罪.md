Wenhui Daily Pleads Guilty to the People

Shanghai Dispatch from our newspaper, July 3rd: After this newspaper published the editorial "Wenhui Daily's Bourgeois Orientation Should Be Criticized," Wenhui Daily has begun its self-criticism, expressing its determination to turn from the bourgeois direction to the socialist road.

On July 2nd, Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled "Pleading Guilty to the People," which deeply examined the errors in the work of Wenhui Daily in the previous period, analyzed and criticized these errors, and admitted that Wenhui Daily had indeed become the mouthpiece of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's frenzied attack on the proletariat in the past few months. The Zhang-Luo Alliance said: Now we need to light fires everywhere. Xu Zhucheng mobilized troops and generals to light fires in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong. The rightists said: Incite students to put up big-character posters in order to take over the schools. Xu Zhucheng "suggested" at the editorial board meeting that the lid of primary and secondary schools should be lifted. Pu Xixiu sent a special telegram from Beijing about "Peking University's 'Democracy Wall'," and Xu Zhucheng designated the editor to publish it no matter what. Publishing one article was not enough, and another had to be published. The rightists said: "Party rule" is the root of all sectarianism. Xu Zhucheng treasured it as if he had found a treasure and personally circled and published Chu Anping's speech, still resentfully complaining that Chu Anping's speech was not sharp enough. The rightists said: Don't talk about achievements, only talk about shortcomings. Xu Zhucheng criticized the editors east and west, saying that there were too many positive articles on the page. In fact, there were no positive articles on the page! The rightists said: Anti-criticism is "closing up." Xu Zhucheng repeatedly warned the editors: The two-point theory is dogma, talking about achievements is also dogma, talking about ideological transformation is also dogma, and anti-criticism is also dogma.

The editorial said: In summary, it can be seen that Wenhui Daily did whatever the rightists said. Xu Zhucheng and Pu Xixiu sang whatever tunes Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji played.

The editorial examined: Wenhui Daily has a Party organization, but it did not play the role that a Party organization should play. They were frightened by Xu Zhucheng's "using the Party to replace the government" cudgel, and their struggle with Xu Zhucheng was weak and powerless.

The editorial expressed its determination to turn Wenhui Daily "from the dangerous road of bourgeois political orientation to the bright path of socialist people's journalism." The editorial said: "The lighthouse has issued another warning signal. If we do not correct our course, the ship will inevitably run aground. Our entire staff is now doing four things: First, thoroughly expose and criticize the various relationships between Wenhui Daily and the rightists. Second, thoroughly expose and criticize the political errors of Wenhui Daily in terms of speech, reporting, and layout since the spring. The above two items of exposure and criticism will be published in the newspaper successively and made public to the readers. We also hope that readers who love our newspaper will provide strict supervision. Third, devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the anti-rightist struggle and use our pens to fight the rightists to the death. Fourth, from now on, we will resolutely wage an irreconcilable and unremitting struggle against bourgeois journalistic views and positions."

On the 3rd, Wenhui Daily continued to publish an editorial entitled "Painfully Transforming Ourselves." The editorial said that the reason why rightists were able to use Wenhui Daily was because many comrades in the newspaper had problems in terms of their positions and ideological viewpoints. The editorial stated that all staff members of Wenhui Daily were determined to transform themselves, firm their positions, change their bourgeois journalistic views, and run a newspaper that serves socialist construction through this anti-rightist struggle.

At the same time, on the 2nd and 3rd, Wenhui Daily also successively published "Our Preliminary Examination" in the name of the editorial department. This examination exposed and criticized the reactionary remarks published in the newspaper and the layout of the newspaper in the previous period. In addition, a "Statement from the Reporting Department of this Newspaper" was published. This statement was adopted at the plenary meeting of the Reporting Department of Wenhui Daily on the morning of the 2nd, signed by Quan Yimao and 21 others. The statement expressed its support for the People's Daily editorial's criticism of Wenhui Daily, and "expressed the greatest indignation at Pu Xixiu and Xu Zhucheng leading Wenhui Daily onto the road of anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist, becoming a tool for rightists to launch a frenzied attack on the proletariat!" The statement also stated that it must deeply examine the errors and shortcomings in its reporting work and repay its debt to the people.

    文汇报向人民请罪
    本报上海3日电　本报发表了“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”的社论以后，这两天文汇报已经开始检讨，表示决心要从资产阶级的方向扭转到社会主义的道路上来。
    2日文汇报发表了题为“向人民请罪”的社论，痛切地检查了文汇报前一时期工作上的错误，对这些错误做了分析和批判，承认文汇报这几个月中确确实实成了章罗联盟向无产阶级猖狂进攻的喉舌。章、罗联盟说：现在要到处点火。徐铸成就调兵遣将到浙江、江西、四川、两湖以及两广去点火。右派说：煽动学生出大字报，以便接管学校。徐铸成又在编委会上“建议”揭中小学的盖子。浦熙修就在北京发来“北京大学‘民主墙’”的专电，徐铸成则指定编辑非登不可。登了一篇仍不够，还要再登一篇。右派说：“党天下”是一切宗派主义的根源。徐铸成如获至宝地亲手围框登出储安平的发言，还悻悻然嫌储安平发言不够尖锐。右派说：不许谈成绩，只许谈缺点。徐铸成就东也批评编辑，西也批评编辑，说版面上正面文章多了。其实，版面上那有正面文章！右派说：反批评就是“收”。徐铸成就三令五申告诫编辑：两点论是教条，谈成绩也是教条，谈思想改造也是教条，反批评也是教条。
    社论说：综上所述，可见右派怎么讲，文汇报就怎么做。章伯钧、罗隆基的锣鼓怎么敲，徐铸成浦熙修就怎么唱。
    社论中检讨：文汇报有党的组织，但是没有起党组织应起的作用，他们被徐铸成的“以党代政”的狼牙棒吓呆了，同徐铸成的斗争是软弱无力的。
    社论表示决心要把文汇报“从资产阶级的政治方向的危险道路扭转到社会主义的人民新闻事业的光明大道上来。”社论说：“灯塔已经发出又一次危险信号了，我们再不摆正舵向，船非触礁不可。我们全社现在正在做四件事：一、彻底揭发和批判文汇报和右派的种种关系。二、彻底揭发和批判文汇报从春季以来言论、报道、编排各方面的政治错误。以上两项揭发与批判，陆续登报，公诸读者。而且盼望爱护我报的读者予以严格监督。三、全心全意投入反右派斗争，用我们的笔，与右派决一死战。四、从今以后，坚决与资产阶级新闻观点和立场作不调和的不懈怠的斗争。”
    3日，文汇报又以“痛切改造自己”为题继续发表了社论。社论说，右派分子所以能够利用文汇报，是因为报社的许多同志在立场上、思想观点上有问题。社论表示，文汇报的全体工作人员，决心通过这次反右派斗争，改造自己，坚定立场，改变资产阶级新闻观点，办好一张为社会主义建设服务的报纸。
    文汇报同时还在2日和3日连续以编辑部的名义发表了“我们的初步检查”。这篇检查对文汇报前一时期报上发表的反动言论和报纸版面的编排，作了揭发和批判。另外还发表了一篇“本报采访部的声明”，这篇声明是在2日上午文汇报采访部全体会议上通过的，签名的有全一毛等二十二人。声明表示拥护人民日报社论对文汇报的批评，对“浦熙修、徐铸成把文汇报引向反共、反人民、反社会主义的道路，成为右派分子向无产阶级猖狂进攻的工具，表示最大的愤慨！”声明并表示一定要深刻检查自己报道工作中的错误和缺点，向人民还债。
