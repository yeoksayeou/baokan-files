I, on behalf of the people of Fujian Province, express my complete agreement and sincere support for Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. I also express my agreement and satisfaction with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1956 national final accounts and the 1957 national budget draft, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the implementation results of the 1956 national economic plan and the draft of the 1957 national economic plan, and the reports of all the leaders.

Under the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, our country has achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements on all work fronts at home and abroad. Since the last National People's Congress, even greater and more glorious achievements have been made in the past year, and socialist construction has made a leap forward. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed, consolidating and developing the people's democratic power led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Under the encouragement of the policy of unity, education, and transformation, intellectuals have formed an alliance with workers and peasants, further enhancing the role of the people's democratic united front. Premier Zhou's visits to eleven countries in Asia and Europe have further strengthened the unity of socialist countries and also strengthened ties with nationalist countries. More and more countries have adopted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our country strengthens the unity and development of the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union, and our country promotes friendly cooperation with Asian and African countries, and opposes the expansionist policy of U.S. imperialism, which is an important key to defending the country's socialist construction and the cause of world peace. Not long ago, Chairman Voroshilov of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union visited our country, marking a new major development in the brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp, which has played a greater role in safeguarding the cause of world peace. The brilliant and huge achievements in socialist construction are clear to everyone who is not blind. Some people attempt to obliterate these achievements, saying that the achievements are mainly "dogmatic," in order to confuse right and wrong and deceive the public, which is completely wrong.

Our Common Goal is to Build Socialism

At a time when our country has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution and is developing in a new situation, Chairman Mao instructed on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and the Chinese Communist Party also issued instructions on the rectification movement. This is timely, extremely necessary, and also demonstrates the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, which is supported by the people of the whole country. The 1942 rectification achieved the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, and established the People's Republic of China. This year's rectification is to oppose subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, with the correct handling of contradictions among the people as the central content. The highest goal of the rectification is to unite the people of the whole country to build socialism, which is a huge force to promote socialist construction. In this way, we can better unite all forces that can be united and mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction. I think this rectification will surely achieve a great victory like the last rectification. Chairman Mao's instructions stipulate six criteria, the most important of which are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. Chairman Mao's instructions further point out that consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries are where our basic policies and basic interests lie. Our common goal is to build a socialist society, and our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. We all know that the core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party, and all words and actions that deviate from socialism are completely wrong. The right-wing elements' slander of the leadership of the Party and the state is extremely absurd. Opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party, opposition to socialism, and opposition to the people's democratic dictatorship are all absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. I believe that the people of our country will unite even more closely, work together under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist industrialized country in a not too long period of time. If we earnestly study Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and improve our thinking and devote ourselves to the rectification movement, our words and deeds will not make mistakes or make fewer mistakes. I hope that the right-wing elements will come to their senses and quickly transform their erroneous thoughts. Resisting transformation will inevitably isolate them from the people.

Fujian Farmers' Production Enthusiasm is Very High

I am from Fujian, please allow me to talk a little about the situation in Fujian. Fujian, like all parts of the country, is also studying Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people in preparation for participating in the unfolding rectification movement. The fourth session of the Provincial People's Congress was held a month ago. This meeting further promoted democracy. People's representatives and attendees enthusiastically put forward opinions, exposed contradictions, analyzed contradictions, and resolved contradictions to help the Party promote the rectification movement. In the past year, the province has implemented the national plan on all work fronts in accordance with the central government's policies and guidelines. Industry has made great progress, and a production upsurge has been set off in factories and mines throughout the province. The total output value has increased a lot compared with the previous year. Agricultural production last year created the highest grain yield record in the province's history. Last year, more than a dozen counties and cities across the country reached the twelve-year production target stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program. Longxi County in Fujian was ranked first. Moreover, in some areas of Longxi and Haicheng counties, the yield per mu reached more than 2,000 jin, and in some other areas, the yield of sweet potatoes per mu reached more than 15,000 jin. The main task of agricultural production in the province this year is to focus on grain and comprehensively develop production to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of agricultural products. I recently inspected agricultural production in various regions of Fujian and accompanied the province's Party and government leaders to work in the fields in the suburbs of Fuzhou. I did transplanting and weeding work, and had many opportunities to contact and talk with farmers. Farmers' production enthusiasm is very high. Due to last year's bumper harvest, farmers have learned from their actual lives the superiority of cooperation. This year, they are very enthusiastic about striving for increased production. They have full confidence in increasing production and achieving a bumper harvest. Commerce, transportation, culture, education, health, and other social undertakings have also developed considerably.

Hope to Find a Way to Complete the Nanfu Railway

What should be especially mentioned is that since the second half of last year, the Yingtan to Nanping section of the Yingxia Railway has been opened to traffic and directly connects to Shanghai. Now the entire Yingxia line has also been opened to traffic, and the railway transportation that the people of Fujian have been looking forward to for decades has been realized. If it were not for the full support of the central government and the vigorous and hard work of the railway corps and the joint efforts of hundreds of thousands of civilian workers in the province, it would not have been possible to complete it one year ahead of schedule. The funds saved by the railway corps can build one and a half railways from Nanping to Fuzhou. The economies of all the areas through which this railway passes and its affected areas have prospered. The people of Fujian thank the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and also thank the railway corps. At present, although the Nanping to Fuzhou railway is under construction, the track laying plan only reaches Eyang near Shuikou in order to save money. From Eyang to Fuzhou, it is necessary to change to small wheels for loading, which is inconvenient for passenger and cargo transportation. Only one hundred kilometers are left to Fuzhou and the track cannot be laid. Fuzhou is the provincial capital of Fujian Province and has close economic, political, and cultural ties with the entire province. It is also located in the coastal defense area. Taiwan has not yet been liberated, which is even more related to military affairs. Maritime transportation is still subject to harassment from Taiwan from time to time. This Nanfu Railway is particularly needed. When I led a comfort group of hundreds of people at the end of last year on behalf of the people of the province to the construction site to comfort the railway corps and civilian workers, I was really moved by their spirit of hard work. The Nanfu Railway was originally scheduled to be completed and opened to traffic in Fuzhou in May of this year. Now the track is only laid to Eyang, and stopping there is a waste of previous efforts. I don't know when it will be rebuilt. We know that this is the whole plan, but only doing the roadbed without laying the track will be quickly damaged, which will not save the country and will cause great losses. Therefore, I hope that the central government will do its best to take charge and find a way to lay the track to Fuzhou. Only one hundred kilometers of steel rails are needed, and it is not difficult to collect them throughout the country. When I inspected the Longyan area this time, I learned that there are large amounts of coal, iron sand, lime, wood, and bamboo there. Because transportation is inconvenient and transportation is difficult, it cannot be transported out, and these resources are currently needed for national construction. Therefore, I also hope that the central government will advance the construction of this branch line from Zhangping to Longyan, which is only tens of kilometers long, and connect it to the Yingxia main line. Now the survey has been completed, and it is only waiting for the decision to start construction, which will make the mountain economy more active and increase the materials for national construction.

In Fujian, Party Members and Non-Party Members Get Along Very Well

In Fujian, the work of the people's democratic united front is done very well, and Party members and non-Party members get along very well. I feel that the leading comrades of the Party have great trust, close care, and care for me, and they consult with me on many important matters. This spring, I suffered from a serious illness. The leading comrades of the CPC Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee were very concerned about me. They decided to invite famous doctors from Shanghai for diagnosis and treatment for me, and the director of the Health Department personally guided and helped with the treatment, so that I could be reborn. The qualities and morals of the Communist Party members are so noble, and I am very grateful. They are also very kind and amiable to other democratic parties. In the Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, democracy is promoted and consultations are held on everything.

Fujian is located on the forefront of national defense and is also located on the forefront of the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Separated from Taiwan by only a strait, the people of Fujian have been actively using various methods to publicize to the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas the lenient policies of the people and the government of the motherland towards them in the process of striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The American aggressors killed the people of Taiwan in Taiwan, which aroused the anti-American movement among the compatriots in Taiwan. It is the inevitable result of the oppression and bullying of the people of Taiwan by US imperialism. Even among the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, there are many people who expressed dissatisfaction. We hope that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and the people of Taiwan will stand together to oppose the American aggressors, quickly respond to the great call of the motherland, unite under the banner of patriotism, and complete the great cause of the unification of the motherland.

The people of Fujian will unite more closely, unite with the people of the whole country, resolutely fight against the right-wing elements, and contribute all their strength and mobilize all positive factors in the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan and prepare for the realization of the second five-year plan, liberate Taiwan at an early date, accelerate the completion of the country's socialist construction, and strive for the victory of world peace!

    社会主义建设的巨大成就是抹杀不了的
    陈绍宽的发言
    我代表福建全省人民对于毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的指示和周总理的政府工作报告，表示完全同意和诚恳拥护，对于李先念副总理的关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理的关于一九五六年度国民经济计划的执行结果和一九五七年度国民经济计划草案的报告以及各位首长的报告，我也表示同意和满意。
    我们国家在伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在国内、国际各个工作战线上都取得了空前的辉煌成就，从去年全国人民代表大会会议之后，在一年的时间内又取得了更伟大光辉的成就，社会主义建设有了跃进的发展，农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成，巩固和发展了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权。知识分子在团结、教育、改造的政策鼓舞下，已经同工人、农民结成了联盟，更加发挥了人民民主统一战线的作用。周总理访问亚洲、欧洲十一个国家之后，更加强了社会主义国家的团结，也加强了和民族主义国家的联系，越来越多的国家采用了和平共处的五项原则，我们国家加强以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营的团结和发展，以及我国增进同亚非国家的友好合作，反对美帝国主义的扩张政策，是保卫国家的社会主义建设和世界和平事业的重要关键。不久以前，苏联最高苏维埃会议伏罗希洛夫主席来我国访问，标志着中苏两国兄弟般友谊的新的重大发展和巩固社会主义阵营的团结，这对于保卫世界和平事业起了更大的作用。社会主义建设中的辉煌、巨大的成就，只要不是瞎子，谁都是看得很清楚的，有些人企图抹煞这种成就，说什么成绩主要的是“教条”，以混淆是非，蒙混视听，这是完全错误的。
    我们共同的目标是建设社会主义
    当我们国家取得了社会主义革命决定性胜利并正处在新形势发展的时候，毛主席指示正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，中国共产党也发出整风运动的指示，这是适时的极其需要的，也是表明中国共产党的伟大，是得到全国人民拥护的。一九四二年整风取得了抗日战争和解放战争的伟大胜利，彻底完成了资产阶级民主革命，建立了中华人民共和国。今年整风是反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，以正确处理人民内部矛盾为中心内容，整风最高目的是团结全国人民来建设社会主义，这是推动社会主义建设工作的一个巨大力量，这样一来就更可以团结一切可能团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，来为社会主义建设服务。我想这次整风一定会同上一次整风一样取得伟大胜利。毛主席的指示中规定了六条标准，其中最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条，毛主席指示中更指出巩固同苏联的团结，巩固同一切社会主义国家的团结，这是我们的基本方针基本利益所在。我们共同的目标是建设社会主义社会，我们国家是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。我们大家都晓得，领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党，一切离开社会主义的言论行动是完全错误的，那些右派分子诬蔑党和国家的领导是极端荒谬的，反对共产党的领导、反对社会主义、反对人民民主专政等等，都是全国人民所绝对不能容许的。我相信我们全国人民一定更加紧密团结一致，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，共同努力，在不太长的时间内，把我国建设成为一个繁荣的富强的社会主义工业化的国家。我们认真学习毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，提高自己的思想，投入整风运动，我们的言行就不会犯错误或者少犯错误，希望右派分子幡然悔悟，赶快把错误思想转变过来，抗拒改造，必将自绝于人民。
    福建农民生产情绪非常高涨
    我是从福建来的，请让我谈一点福建的情况。福建是同全国各地一样，也正在学习毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示，以备投入正在展开的整风运动，省人民代表大会第四次会议前一个月才开过，这次会议更发扬了民主，人民代表和列席人员踊跃提出意见，揭露矛盾、分析矛盾和解决矛盾来帮助党推行整风运动。本省一年来在各个工作战线上根据中央的政策方针，执行国家计划，工业有了很大的发展，全省厂矿掀起了生产高潮，总产值比前年增长很多。农业生产去年创造了本省历史上最高的粮食丰产记录，去年全国范围内有十几个县市粮食产量达到农业发展纲要所规定的十二年的生产指标，福建龙溪县就是列在第一位，并且龙溪、海澄两个县有的地区每亩产量达到两千斤以上，有的其他区，地瓜每亩产量达到一万五千斤以上。本省今年农业生产主要任务是以粮食为主，全面发展生产，争取农产的全面大丰收。我最近到福建各地区视察农业生产情况和随同本省党政领导同志到福州市郊下田劳动，我做的是插秧耘草工作，与农民接触交谈机会很多，农民生产情绪非常高涨，由于去年的丰收，农民从实际生活中体会到合作化的优越性，今年对于争取增产的劲头很大，他们对于增产丰收有着充分的信心。商业、交通、文教卫生以及其他社会事业都有相当的发展。
    希望设法修成南福铁路
    尤其特别要提出的，去年下半年起鹰厦铁路的鹰潭到南平段已经通车了，并且直达上海，现在鹰厦全线也已通车，福建人民数十年所盼望的铁路交通已经实现了。这条铁路如果不是中央全力主持和铁道兵部队发挥大力艰苦奋斗和本省十几万民工共同努力工作，就不可能提前一年完成，铁道兵部队节约下来的经费可以修造一条半南平到福州的铁路。凡是这条铁路经过的及其影响的地区，经济都繁荣起来了，我们福建人民感谢中国共产党、感谢中央人民政府、感谢毛主席，也感谢铁道兵部队。目前，南平到福州这条铁路虽然在修造着，但是为了节约，铺轨计划只到水口附近之莪洋，莪洋到福州还得换小轮装载，客货转运都感不便，余下离福州只有一百公里不能铺轨。福州是福建省会地区，与全省经济、政治、文化都有密切关系，又是处在海防地区，台湾尚未解放，对于军事更有关系，海上交通运输不时还受着台湾的骚扰，这条南福铁路是特别需要的。我去年年底率领慰问团数百人代表全省人民到工地进行慰问铁道兵部队和民工的时候，看到他们艰苦奋斗的精神实在令人感动无已。南福铁路原定本年五月修到福州通车，现在只铺轨到莪洋，这样功亏一篑地停下来，以后不晓得什么时候才能够重修，我们知道这是整个计划，但是只做路基不铺轨是会很快损坏的，于国家并不节省，而且是有很大损失，所以希望中央尽可能大力主持，设法铺轨到福州，只有一百公里的钢轨，在全国范围内稍加集凑是不难办到的。我这回到龙岩地区视察，知道那块有大量的煤炭、铁砂、石灰、木材、竹子，因为交通不便，运输困难，无法运出，而这些资源又是目前国家建设很需要的东西，所以也希望中央提前兴修这条漳平到龙岩只有几十公里长的支路，接上鹰厦干线，现在勘测已经清楚，只待决定开工，这样更能够使山区经济活跃，国家建设资材得以增加。
    在福建党员同非党员相处很好
    在福建，人民民主统一战线工作做得很好，党员与非党员相处也很好，我感觉到党的领导同志对我有很大的信任，亲密关怀和照顾，许多重要事情都和我协商，我今春患了重病，中共省委和省人民委员会领导同志对我十分密切关怀，他们为我决定延请上海名医诊治，卫生厅长亲自指导帮同救治，使我得以回生，共产党员的品质道德是这样高贵，我万分感激，他们平时对其他民主党派人士也是非常亲密和和蔼的。在省人民代表大会和省政协更是发扬民主，遇事协商。
    福建地处国防最前线，也是处在解放台湾斗争的最前线，同台湾只隔一个海峡，福建人民在争取和平解放台湾的过程中，已经积极运用各种方法向台湾和海外国民党军政人员展开宣传祖国人民和祖国政府对待他们的宽大政策。美国侵略者在台湾杀害台湾人民，激起台湾同胞反美运动，是美帝国主义压迫欺凌台湾人民的必然结果，就是台湾的国民党军政人员中也有不少的人表示不满，我们希望台湾的国民党军政人员和台湾人民站在一起共同反对美国侵略者，赶快响应祖国的伟大号召，在爱国的旗帜下，团结一致，完成祖国的统一大业。
    我们福建人民一定更加紧密团结一致，同全国人民一道，坚决与右派分子作斗争，并本着增产节约的方针，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，贡献一切力量，调动一切积极因素，为完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，并准备实现第二个五年计划，早日解放台湾，加速完成国家的社会主义建设和争取世界和平胜利而奋斗！
