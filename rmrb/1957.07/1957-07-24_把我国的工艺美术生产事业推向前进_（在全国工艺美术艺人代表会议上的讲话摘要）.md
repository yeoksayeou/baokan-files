Promote the Development of China's Arts and Crafts Production
(Summary of a Speech at the National Conference of Arts and Crafts Artists)
Bai Rubing, Director of the Central Handicraft Administration Bureau and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Federation

The purpose of convening this conference is to broadly exchange technical experiences, learn from each other, help each other, learn from strengths and make up for weaknesses, improve together, and unite the nation's arts and crafts artists and all related forces to greatly promote the development of China's arts and crafts production. Today, outstanding representatives of the nation's arts and crafts artists are gathered here, which can be described as a "gathering of heroes" in the arts and crafts world. This is an unprecedented joyous event for arts and crafts artists across the country.

I. Glorious History, Tragic Circumstances

China's arts and crafts have a long history and superb skills. They are the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people and the pride of our nation.

In the old society, arts and crafts were not valued. Especially before liberation, under the devastation of imperialist aggression and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the arts and crafts industry declined day by day. Many artists were forced to change careers due to livelihood pressures, unable to eat or dress warmly, suffering from hunger and cold, and displaced. The Jun porcelain of Henan, one of the five famous kilns of the Song Dynasty, was forced to stop production during the Anti-Japanese War. Jingdezhen, China's famous porcelain capital, only produced one-third of its pre-1937 output in 1949. In the jade industry in Beijing, there were more than 500 households in 1900, but by 1942 almost all of them had stopped production, leaving only more than 30 households. In the past, there was a saying in the jade industry in Beijing: "Repaying the sins of beating parents in a past life by working in gold and jade in this life." In the Xiang embroidery industry in Hunan Province, there was also a saying: "Hanging Xiang embroidery in the main room is not as good as hanging straw sandals." These fully reflect the depression of the arts and crafts industry and the tragic situation of the artists at that time. Despite this, most of the arts and crafts, which represent the excellent traditions of Chinese national culture, were preserved, which is inseparable from the long-term arduous struggle of the vast number of artists.

II. Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, Thriving

The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution brought immense brilliance to all production endeavors in China, and also opened up broad prospects for the development of the arts and crafts industry. Thanks to the attention and care of the Party and the government, and in accordance with the policy of protection, development, and improvement, various measures conducive to the development of the arts and crafts industry have been taken, such as supplying raw materials, processing orders, providing technical guidance, offering low-interest loans, and granting tax preferences. This has enabled many artists who had changed careers to return to their professions, and the production and lives of many artists have been settled. Many famous products that had been lost have been restored. For example, Jun porcelain in Henan, burned porcelain in Beijing, bamboo filament inlay in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, silver filament products in Chengdu, Sichuan, and chrysanthemum stone in Liuyang, Hunan, have all resumed production after liberation.

In the spring of 1956, the whole country was celebrating with gongs and drums, and the vast number of artists joyfully embarked on the socialist road in the upsurge of handicraft cooperation. By the end of 1956, there were 5.4 million people in handicraft cooperatives (groups) across the country, including 760,000 artisans, forming 2,300 arts and crafts cooperatives (groups), accounting for 98.6% of all professional artisans. There are also a large number of rural part-time workers, such as those who braid straw hat braids, embroider, make lace, and hemp hats, who participate in agricultural production in agricultural cooperatives while also engaging in the production of arts and crafts.

After joining various forms of cooperative organizations, artists across the country fundamentally got rid of exploitation and embarked on the broad road of socialism. After cooperation, within just over a year, cooperative arts and crafts organizations have demonstrated great superiority in all aspects.

After being organized, the development of arts and crafts production has been very rapid. In 1956, the total output value of professional arts and crafts across the country was 170 million yuan (including the output value of farmers engaged in part-time work, it was 270 million yuan), an increase of one and a half times compared to 1952. The output value of porcelain in Jingdezhen in 1956 increased by 1.9 times compared to 1949; the output value of Xiang embroidery in Hunan in 1956 increased by 30 times compared to 1952, both exceeding the highest levels before the Anti-Japanese War. After organizing cooperatives, the Yangzhou lacquerware artists not only restored many precious products, but also added more than 100 new products such as bamboo carving inlays and lacquerware hanging screens.

After being organized, artists have better creative conditions, which facilitates mutual teaching, mutual learning, and joint improvement of skills. Many grass-roots cooperatives have established technical research organizations. Arts and crafts research institutions have been successively established in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Suzhou, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Weifang, and other places. After the establishment of arts and crafts research institutions in Beijing and Shanghai, 58 veteran artists were hired as researchers. The research laboratory established in Fuzhou has created more than 250 new products in the past year or so. Artists from various places have also visited each other, going deep into reality and experiencing life. Many artists' excellent works have also been exhibited and evaluated. Yang Shihui and other seven artists carved the grand occasion of the people of the capital celebrating the promulgation of the Constitution on a 130-jin ivory, with the entire view of Beihai as the background. If it were not for being organized, it would be unimaginable. Aren't these all the benefits of cooperation?

After being organized, the number of new young artists, led by master craftsmen, is increasing. For example, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, has cultivated 40 Huishan clay sculpture artists. In Suzhou City, 138 apprentices were recruited in 13 industries in 1956. The city also signed 152 apprenticeship contracts in 11 cooperatives based on the principle of voluntariness, and conducted regular inspections, which yielded good results. Many of the representatives present have become models of openly sharing skills and actively training apprentices. In the old society, due to the system of people exploiting people, the lives of artists were not guaranteed. The saying "Teach the apprentice, starve the master" and "Competitors are enemies" existed, so many industries had established rules such as "Visiting is allowed, but not observation," "Raise sons to prevent aging, preserve skills to protect oneself," and "Pass on to sons, not daughters." In the new society, the system of exploitation has been eliminated, and the lives of artists have been guaranteed. As a result, many artists have openly shared their unique skills and passed them on to their apprentices without reservation.

After being organized, production has become normal, the lives of artists have improved, and their political status has also been enhanced. In 1955, the average wage of members of arts and crafts cooperatives (groups) across the country increased by 165% compared to 1952. After the wage adjustment in 1956, there was further growth. According to a survey of 1,563 people in 12 cooperatives (groups) in Suzhou City, the average wage of members increased by 21% compared to before the adjustment. Many arts and crafts cooperatives have also established labor insurance and welfare facilities. Many regions have made appropriate arrangements for elderly and frail veteran artists. In some regions, artists' representatives participate in people's congresses and political consultative conferences. For example, some of the representatives present are representatives of people's congresses at all levels or members of political consultative conferences at all levels. Some regions have also convened artists' representative conferences to exchange opinions and propose methods on how to develop local arts and crafts. These are all things that have never happened in history.

When we think about the past and look at the present, the different situations of the old and new societies are in stark contrast! As some artists have said: "The Communist Party saved us," "There is only one path, we must always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and advance towards socialism."

III. Beautifying People's Lives, Supporting National Construction

From the perspective of the characteristics of arts and crafts, they have both economic and artistic value. They can be roughly divided into two categories: daily necessities and artistic appreciation items. The vast majority of these arts and crafts come from the people and have a broad mass base, meeting the needs of the broad masses for beautifying their lives.

China's arts and crafts also serve exports. From 1950 to 1956, the total export value of arts and crafts reached more than 330 million yuan. This has played a certain role in earning foreign exchange and supporting the country's socialist industrialization.

In the past seven years, China's arts and crafts have been exhibited 61 times in 27 countries, with 34 million visitors, winning praise from many foreigners. In international technical exchanges, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Federation undertook 14 technical data items related to arts and crafts production for six fraternal countries in 1956. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, and other countries have also successively sent delegations to China for inspection and visits. Mongolia, Vietnam, North Korea, Albania, Myanmar, and other countries have also successively sent trainees to China to learn skills. All of these have played a positive role in promoting international economic and cultural exchanges and enhancing the unity and friendship of the people of all countries.

IV. Continue to Implement the Policy of Protection, Development, and Improvement

Our ability to achieve such great achievements is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party and the government and the hard work of all artists. As everyone knows, our Party and government have consistently adopted the policy of protection, development, and improvement for the arts and crafts industry. Under this policy, we have achieved many accomplishments, but there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, the variety of designs and colors of some products is still outdated, production cannot keep up with demand, and some places have not done enough to help artists. In order to promote the arts and crafts industry of new China, we must continue to implement the policy of protection, development, and improvement, so that this flower garden of arts and crafts can bloom even more brightly through everyone's hard work.

How can we correctly implement this policy? We should clarify what to protect, what to develop, and what to improve.

What should we protect? In short, we must protect the national heritage so that the excellent traditions of China's arts and crafts can be fully preserved and carried forward. Over the years, the arts and crafts created by Chinese artists are numerous, colorful, and have national and local characteristics and styles. We must treat these valuable heritages representing Chinese national culture with caution, learn and inherit them well, and not rudely negate them easily. We should systematically study, organize, and summarize the historical data of China's arts and crafts and the experiences of artists, distinguish between good and bad things, and gradually raise them to a scientific level, so that they can be written into books and passed on to future generations. We should make reasonable arrangements for outstanding artists in all walks of life in terms of production and life, so that they can focus on their own creative work and pass on their skills. We should investigate and understand the artists who have changed careers, and absorb them to quickly return to their professions. Because we are in a great era of inheriting the past and opening up the future, we must resolutely and actively protect the many unique skills and arts passed down by our ancestors, prevent "the death of the person and the extinction of the art," so as not to regret it too late.

What should we develop? To answer this question, we must first clarify the service direction of arts and crafts. We believe that arts and crafts should serve the material and cultural lives of the people and the socialist construction of the motherland. Starting from this premise, as long as it meets the needs of the country and the people, whether it is a daily necessity or an artistic appreciation item, whether it is for domestic or foreign sales, we should do our best to develop production to meet the needs.

China's arts and crafts production has raw materials, markets, and no shortage of manpower. There are many favorable conditions, and the prospects for development are very magnificent. But this does not mean that we can ignore the actual situation, regardless of priorities, and develop equally. We should make specific development plans according to the needs of domestic and foreign markets, the different situations of industries and products, and by region and industry, and proceed in a planned and step-by-step manner to avoid possible errors and shortcomings in the process of advancement.

What should we improve? The main thing is to improve the economic and artistic quality of arts and crafts to meet the needs of the broad masses and the international market. In order to achieve this requirement, whether it is a daily necessity or an artistic appreciation item, production should comply with the principles of "suitability, economy, and beauty." In creative design, we should combine the requirements of real life on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of China's arts and crafts, resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new," and strive to improve the skills of artists and the ideological and artistic nature of arts and crafts. We must not lose our national and local characteristics and styles, and we must not sever history, but this is not to promote all "imitations of the ancient" without criticism. We must also absorb all the good and useful things in foreign arts and crafts to enrich ourselves. Only in this way can we continuously improve and innovate, and greatly improve the arts and crafts production of socialist new China.

V. Take Active Measures, Moving from Victory to Victory

With a correct policy, there must also be active measures:

First, we must cherish and improve arts and crafts artists. This requires appropriately arranging their work according to the specialties of artists in various industries, and fully utilizing their enthusiasm in technical guidance and creation. Some elderly and frail artists or artists with unique styles of products should be allowed to produce independently if it is inconvenient for them to participate in collective production. We should also help and improve artists who have not joined the cooperative in all aspects. We cannot ignore them, nor can we force them to join the cooperative. For artists with special creative talents, they should be given convenience in design research and creation, and a fixed working hour system should not be rigidly stipulated. In order to enable them to concentrate on creation, whether in grass-roots production units or in design research institutions, they should generally be given a fixed salary, and spiritual or material rewards should be given for special contributions. Elderly and frail artists should generally be appropriately arranged by the production unit where they are located, so that they can undertake some technical guidance work that they can undertake. For individual artists who have completely lost their ability to work, the production unit where they are located should also be responsible for raising them. If the grass-roots production unit has difficulties in bearing the burden, the joint cooperative or the government can also bear the burden according to the specific situation. In order to improve the creative level of artists, artists can be organized to visit and experience life in a planned way to broaden their horizons and enrich their creative content. New works observation meetings can also be held, and professional seminars can be held to exchange experiences in creative design and invite experts to provide guidance. It should be recognized that veteran artists have rich practical production experience and are the inheritors and disseminators of arts and crafts. We should respect them and give them better treatment and convenience for observation and creation. Some young artists have neglected or obliterated the important role of veteran artists in design creation and technical guidance, and unilaterally compared their physical strength and output with them, "sailing a flat boat on a flat river." This tendency of egalitarianism should be prevented and corrected.

Second, we must vigorously train new artists. In order to do this work well, we cannot advocate simple and quick methods for training apprentices. To truly learn a skill, without sufficient time, hard work, and careful study, it is obviously impossible to learn well. Therefore, the apprenticeship period for apprentices should generally be three years, and industries with complex skills can also be stipulated as four or five years. In the future, during the apprenticeship period, apprentices should generally only be responsible for eating and given a small amount of pocket money. It is not appropriate to evaluate wage grades, let alone implement a piece-rate wage system. In order to enable apprentices to learn comprehensive skills, there should generally be a fixed teacher-student relationship. Both the cooperative and the teacher and student must sign a contract, clearly stipulating the obligations and rights of both parties, and implement guaranteed teaching and learning. The teacher should be given appropriate subsidies for mentoring apprentices to ensure that the teacher's income does not decrease due to mentoring apprentices. In order to encourage artists to actively impart skills, they should be allowed to choose their own apprentices in the future, and they can also train their own children. At present, our requirements for training apprentices are mainly to inherit the traditional skills and experience of veteran artists to prevent the loss of unique skills. We should advocate "respecting teachers and loving apprentices," encourage artists to impart skills, and educate apprentices to study hard and practice diligently, so as to teach well and learn well.

Third, we must closely integrate with production, strengthen the design work of arts and crafts, and improve the variety of designs and colors. From the current production situation, many artists can both design and manufacture, and they are the basic force in the arts and crafts production industry. Design work must first rely on the vast number of artists, and give full play to their talents and enthusiasm. The technical research organizations of grass-roots arts and crafts cooperatives must be strengthened, and those that have not been established should be gradually established. The design research institutions in key areas should be gradually enriched if they have already been established, and those that have not been established should also strive to establish them as soon as possible. When designing, we must always pay attention to observing real life, investigating and understanding the people's preferences and market needs, and go deep into the grass-roots production units to research, design, and trial-produce simultaneously. We should surround creation, guide production, and continuously improve the variety of designs and colors through practice. After the design work is completed, it must also go through the stages of evaluation, selection, sampling, trial production, trial sales, and active promotion before being put into mass production. The high-quality raw materials required for new products or high-quality products are required to be given priority by the commercial departments.

Fourth, we must strengthen contacts, strengthen unity, and achieve a close combination of artists, arts and crafts workers, and scientific and technological workers. We should see that although the vast number of artists have experience in practical production, they have had difficulty in learning in the past due to life pressures. The general level of cultural science is low, and they have limited knowledge. It is difficult to improve quickly on their own. Therefore, artists should actively and humbly learn from arts and crafts workers and scientific and technological workers. We warmly welcome arts and crafts workers to go deep into the grass-roots level to give artists more practical guidance and help. At the same time, we also require scientific and technological workers in various places to understand and help arts and crafts cooperatives solve problems related to science and technology in production. Our comrades engaged in production management should closely contact cultural, scientific, commercial, and other relevant departments. We should humbly learn from artists, learn from arts and crafts workers, and learn from scientific and technological workers. Because only by being familiar with production and understanding the relevant problems in production can we better do the production guidance work.

The Party and the government have great expectations for the vast number of artists, and the tasks of the artists are arduous and glorious. Of course, on the road ahead, we will encounter some difficulties, but as long as we unite and help each other under the leadership of the Party and the government, humbly learn, guard against arrogance and impatience, work hard, and strive to improve our political and ideological awareness and professional level, the difficulties can certainly be overcome. Chairman Mao taught us: "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind. We should always remember this truth." We believe that after this representative meeting, driven by your exemplary actions, artists across the country will certainly be able to use their hard work to greatly promote the development of China's arts and crafts production!

    把我国的工艺美术生产事业推向前进
    （在全国工艺美术艺人代表会议上的讲话摘要）
    中央手工业管理局局长全国手工业合作总社筹委会主任  白如冰
    这次会议的召开，是为了广泛地交流技艺经验，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，团结全国工艺美术艺人和各方面的力量，把我国的工艺美术生产事业大大地推向前进。今天全国工艺美术艺人的优秀代表在这里会聚一堂，可以说是工艺美术界的“群英会”，这是全国工艺美术艺人空前未有的大喜事。
    一、光辉的历史，悲惨的境遇
    我国的工艺美术，历史悠久，技艺高超，它是我国劳动人民智慧的结晶，也是我们民族的骄傲。
  在旧社会里，工艺美术是不被重视的；特别是解放前，在帝国主义侵略和国民党反动统治的摧残下，工艺美术行业日益衰落，很多艺人为生活所迫，不得不改行转业，吃不饱，穿不暖，饥寒交迫，流离失所。宋代五大名窑的河南钧瓷，抗战期间被迫停产了。我国著名瓷都景德镇，1949年的产量，仅及1937年以前产量的三分之一。北京市的玉器业，在1900年间有五百多户，到1942年几乎全部停产，仅剩下三十多户。过去，在北京市玉器行业中流传着：“前世里打爹骂娘，今世来干金玉两行”。湖南省湘绣行业中也流传着：“堂屋里挂湘绣，不如挂草鞋”。这些都充分地反映了当时工艺美术行业的不景气和艺人们的悲惨境遇。尽管如此，代表着我国民族文化优秀传统的工艺美术，大部分还是保存下来了，这是和广大艺人长期艰苦的斗争分不开的。
    二、合作互助，欣欣向荣
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，给我国一切生产事业带来了万丈光芒，也为工艺美术事业开辟了广阔的发展前途。由于党和政府的重视和关怀，并且根据保护、发展和提高的方针，采取了各种有利于工艺美术事业发展的措施，如供应原料、加工订货、技术指导、低利贷款、税收优待等等，使许多过去改了行的艺人归了队，很多艺人的生产和生活得到了安置，不少失传了的著名产品得到了恢复。比如，河南的钧瓷，北京的烧瓷，浙江温州的篾丝镶嵌，四川成都的银丝制品，湖南浏阳的菊花石等等，都是在解放以后恢复生产的。
    1956年的春天，全国敲锣打鼓，广大艺人在手工业合作化的高潮中，兴高采烈地走上了社会主义道路。到1956年底，全国手工业合作社（组）共有五百四十万人，其中有手工艺人七十六万人，组成了二千三百个工艺合作社（组），占全部专业手工艺人的98.6％。还有为数众多的农村兼业人员，如编草帽辫的、刺绣的、作花边、麻帽的等等，一面在农业合作社参加农业生产，一面又从事工艺美术品的制作。
    全国艺人参加了各种不同形式的合作组织以后，就从根本上摆脱了剥削，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。合作化以后，仅仅一年多的时间内，工艺合作组织就已经从各方面显示出巨大的优越性。
    组织起来以后，工艺美术品生产的发展速度很快。1956年全国专业工艺美术品的总产值为一亿七千万元（如包括农民兼营的产值则为二亿七千万元），比1952年增长了一倍半。景德镇的瓷器，1956年的产值比1949年增长了一点九倍；湖南的湘绣，1956年的产值比1952年增长了三十倍，两者都超过抗日战争以前的最高水平。扬州市漆器业艺人，在组织合作社以后，不仅恢复了许多名贵的产品，而且增加了竹刻镶嵌、漆器挂屏等一百余种新产品。
    组织起来以后，艺人有了更好的创作条件，便于互教互学，共同提高技艺。很多基层社建立了技艺研究组织。北京、上海、南京、广州、苏州、福州、重庆、潍坊等地，都相继成立了工艺美术的研究机构。北京、上海两地的工艺美术研究机构成立后，就有五十八位老艺人被聘为研究员。福州市设立的研究实验室，一年多来创制了二百五十多种新产品。各地艺人还互相进行参观访问，深入实际，体验生活。许多艺人的优秀作品，还举行了展览和评比。杨士惠等七位艺人在一百三十斤重的象牙上，以北海全景为背景，刻出了首都人民欢庆宪法颁布的盛况，如果不是组织起来，也是不可想像的事。这些难道不都是合作化带来的好处吗？
    组织起来以后，新的青年艺人，在老师傅的带领下，越来越多了。如江苏省无锡市培养了四十名惠山泥塑艺人。苏州市在十三个行业中，1956年就招收了一百三十八名艺徒。该市还在十一个合作社中，根据自愿原则，签订了一百五十二件师徒合同，并按期进行检查，效果很好。在座的代表们，很多都成为公开技艺、积极培养艺徒的榜样。在旧社会，由于有人剥削人的制度，艺人生活没有保障，“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”、“同行是冤家”，因而许多行业都有“许串门不许参观”、“养儿防后，留艺保身”、“传子不传女”的成规。到了新社会，剥削制度铲除了，艺人们的生活有了保障了，因而许多艺人都公开了自己的绝技、绝艺，无保留地传授给徒弟。
    组织起来以后，生产正常了，艺人们的生活有了改善，政治地位也提高了。1955年全国工艺合作社（组）员的平均工资，比1952年提高了165％。1956年调整工资以后，又有了增长。据苏州市十二个社（组）、一千五百六十三人的调查，社员的平均工资较调整前增长了21％。许多工艺合作社还举办了劳保福利设施。不少地区对年老体衰的老艺人，已作了适当的安排。有些地区的人民代表大会和政治协商会议，都有艺人代表参加，以在座的代表来说，有的就是各级人民代表大会的代表或各级政治协商会议的委员。还有些地区召开了艺人代表会议，就怎样开展地方工艺美术事业交换了意见，提出了办法。这些都是历史上从来没有过的事情。
    我们想想过去，看看现在，旧社会和新社会的不同景况是如何鲜明的对照啊！正如有些艺人所说：“共产党拯救了我们这一号人”，“道路只有一条，我们要永远跟着共产党和毛主席走，向社会主义前进。”
    三、美化了人民生活，支援了国家建设
    从工艺美术品的特点来看，它既有经济价值，又有艺术价值。大体上可分为生活日用品和艺术欣赏品两类。这些工艺美术品，绝大部分都来自民间，有着广泛的群众基础，它适应着广大人民对美化生活的要求。
    我国工艺美术品也为出口服务。从1950年到1956年，工艺美术品的出口总额达三亿三千余万元。这对换取外汇，支援国家社会主义工业化建设，发挥了一定的作用。
    七年来我国的工艺美术品，在二十七个国家先后展览了六十一次，观众达三千四百万人次，博得了很多国外人士的赞誉。在国际技术交流中，1956年全国手工业合作总社筹委会承担了六个兄弟国家的十四项有关工艺美术生产的技术资料。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古等国还先后派遣了代表团，来我国考察访问。蒙古、越南、朝鲜、阿尔巴尼亚、缅甸等国还先后派遣实习生，来我国学习技艺。所有这些，对于促进国际之间的经济、文化交流，增强各国人民的团结与友谊，都起到了积极的作用。
    四、继续贯彻执行保护、发展和提高的方针
    我们所以能够取得这样大的成绩，是同党与政府的正确领导和全体艺人的辛勤劳动分不开的。大家知道，我们的党和政府对工艺美术事业是一贯地采取保护、发展和提高的方针的。在这一方针下，我们已经取得了不少的成就，但工作上的缺点还很多。比如，有些产品的花色品种还陈旧，生产还赶不上需要，有些地方对艺人的帮助还做得不够等。为了把新中国的工艺美术事业推向前进，必须继续贯彻执行保护、发展和提高的方针，使这一工艺美术的花坛，通过大家的辛勤灌溉，开放得更加鲜艳夺目。
    怎么样来正确贯彻这一方针呢？那就应该明确保护什么？发展什么？提高什么？
    我们要保护什么呢？简单说来，就是要保护民族遗产，使我国工艺美术的优良传统能够统统保存下来，并且得到发扬光大。几年以来，我国艺人所创作的工艺美术品，种类繁多，丰富多彩，具有民族的、地方的特点和风格。对于这些代表我国民族文化的宝贵遗产，我们必须谨慎对待，很好地学习继承，不能粗暴地轻易加以否定。对于我国工艺美术的历史资料和艺人们的经验，应该进行系统的研究、整理和总结，区别好的与不好的东西，并逐步提高到科学水平，以便书写成册，传之后世。对于各行各业的优秀艺人，应该在生产上、生活上给以合理安排，让他们安心从事本行创作，传授技艺。对于改行转业、流散在外的艺人，应该进行调查了解，吸收他们迅速归队。因为我们今天是处在一个承前启后的大时代，对于老祖宗传留下来的许多绝技、绝艺，必须坚决地、积极地加以保护，防止“人亡艺绝”，以免后悔莫及。
    我们要发展什么呢？要回答这一问题，首先要明确工艺美术的服务方向，我们认为，工艺美术应该为人民的物质、文化生活和祖国的社会主义建设服务。从这一前提出发，只要符合于国家和人民需要的，不论是生活日用品或者艺术欣赏品，不论是内销或者外销，我们都应该尽力地来发展生产，满足需要。
    我国工艺美术品的生产，有原料，有市场，而且人力也不缺，有利的条件很多，发展的前途非常壮丽。但这不等于说，可以不顾实际情况，不分轻重缓急，来一个平均发展。我们应该根据国内外市场的需要，分别行业和产品的不同情况，按地区、按行业作出具体发展规划，有计划、有步骤地进行，避免前进中可能发生的错误和缺点。
    我们要提高什么呢？主要是提高工艺美术品的经济质量和艺术质量，以适应广大人民和国际市场的需要。为了达到这个要求，不论是生活日用品，或者是艺术欣赏品，在生产上都应当符合“适用、经济、美观”的原则。在创作设计上，应该在继承和发扬我国工艺美术优良传统的基础上，结合现实生活的要求，坚决贯彻执行“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，努力提高艺人的技艺，提高工艺美术品的思想性和艺术性。决不能丢掉我们民族的、地方的特点和风格，不能割断历史，但这也不是毫无批判地提倡一切“仿古”。我们还要吸取外国工艺美术的一切好的、有用的东西，来丰富我们自己。只有这样才能不断地改进创新，把社会主义新中国的工艺美术生产事业大大地提高一步。
    五、采取积极措施，从胜利走向胜利
    有了正确的方针，还必须有积极的措施：
    第一、必须爱护和提高工艺美术艺人。这就要根据各行各业艺人的特长，适当地安排他们工作，充分发挥他们在技艺指导和创作上的积极性。有些年老体衰或者产品有独特风格的艺人，如果不便于参加集体生产，应该允许他们单独生产。对于没有入社的艺人，也要从各方面帮助和提高他们，不能置之不理，也不能勉强要他们加入合作社。对于有特殊创作才能的艺人，应当给予他们设计研究和创作的便利，不要硬性规定工时制度。为了使他们安心从事创作，不论在基层生产单位或者在设计研究机构，一般地应该给予固定工资，有特殊贡献的还应给予精神上或物质上的奖励。对于年老体衰的艺人，一般地应由所在生产单位适当安排，让他们担负一些可能担负的技术指导工作。对于个别完全丧失劳动力的艺人，也应由所在生产单位负责抚养；如果基层生产单位负担有困难，也可以根据具体情况，由联社或政府负担。为了提高艺人的创作水平，可以有计划地组织艺人参观访问，体验生活，扩大眼界，丰富创作内容；还可以召开新作品观摩会，按专业举行座谈，交流创作设计的经验，并聘请专家指导。应该认识，老艺人有丰富的生产实践经验，是工艺美术的继承者和传播者。我们应当尊敬他们，给他们以较好的待遇和观摩、创作的便利，这是合情合理的。有些青年艺人忽视或抹煞了老艺人在设计创作、技艺指导等方面的重要作用，片面地和他们比体力，比产量，“平水驶平船”。这种平均主义的偏向，应该注意防止和纠正。
    第二、必须大力地培养新艺人。为了做好这一工作，对艺徒的培养不能提倡简单的、速成的办法。要真正学习一门技艺，没有充足的时间，痛下功夫，精心钻研，显然是学不好的。因此，艺徒学艺时间，一般地以三年为宜，技艺复杂的行业也可以规定为四年或者五年。今后在艺徒学艺期间，一般地只管吃饭，给予少数的零花钱，不宜评定工资等级，更不能实行计件工资制。为了使艺徒学到全面技艺，一般地应当有固定的师徒关系，合作社及师徒之间都要签订合同，明确规定师徒双方的义务和权利，实行包教保学。师傅带徒弟，应给予适当的津贴，保证师傅的收入不致因带徒弟而减少。为了鼓励艺人传授技艺的积极性，今后应该允许他们自己选择艺徒，也可以培养他们自己的子女。目前我们培养艺徒的要求，主要是承继老艺人传统技艺和经验，以防绝艺失传。我们应当提倡“尊师爱徒”，鼓励艺人传授技艺，教育艺徒勤学苦练，做到教好学好。
    第三、必须紧密结合生产，加强工艺美术的设计工作，改进花色品种。从目前的生产情况来看，很多艺人既能设计，又能制造，他们是工艺美术生产事业的基本力量。设计工作首先要依靠广大艺人，要充分发挥他们的才能和积极性，基层工艺合作社的技艺研究组织，必须加强，没有建立的应当逐步建立。重点地区的设计研究机构，已经设立的要逐步加以充实，没有设立的也要争取早日设立。在进行设计的时候，要经常注意观察现实生活，调查了解人民群众的爱好和市场的需要，深入基层生产单位，边研究、边设计、边试制，环绕创作，指导生产，从实践中不断地改进花色品种。在设计工作完成以后，还要经过评议选稿、试样、试产、试销和积极推广的阶段，然后投入大量生产。新产品或优质产品所需要的优质原料，要求商业部门能予以优先供应。
    第四、必须加强联系，加强团结，做到广大艺人、工艺美术工作者和科学技术工作者三方面密切结合。我们应当看到，广大艺人虽有生产实践的经验，但过去多迫于生活，学习困难，一般的文化科学水平低，见闻少，有一定的局限性，单靠他们自己，要迅速提高是有困难的。因此，艺人们应该主动地、虚心地向工艺美术工作者和科学技术工作者学习。我们热忱地欢迎工艺美术工作者深入基层，给予艺人更多的实际指导和帮助。同时，还要求各地科学技术工作者，了解和帮助工艺合作社，解决生产中有关科学技术方面的问题。我们从事生产管理的同志，应该和文化、科学、商业等有关部门密切联系。虚心地向艺人学习，向工艺美术工作者学习，向科学技术工作者学习。因为只有熟悉生产，了解生产中的有关问题，才能更好地做好生产指导工作。
    党和政府对广大艺人的期望是很大的，艺人们的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。当然，在前进的道路上，还会遇到一些困难，但是只要在党和政府的领导下，大家团结互助，虚心学习，戒骄戒躁，刻苦钻研，努力提高自己的政治思想觉悟和业务水平，困难是一定能够克服的。毛主席教导我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”我们相信，经过这次代表会议以后，在你们的模范行动的推动下，全国艺人一定能够用自己的辛勤劳动，把我国的工艺美术生产事业大踏步地推向前进！
