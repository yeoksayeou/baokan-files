The Anhui provincial literary and art circles, in the anti-rightist struggle, exposed the right-wing anti-Party clique within the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The core members of this group were Wang Ying, member of the Party group of the Federation; Shi Qing, deputy editor-in-chief of "Jianghuai Literature" and member of the Party group of the Federation; and Qian Feng, deputy director of the editorial department of "Jianghuai Literature" and a Communist Party member. Dai Yue, chairman of the Federation and secretary of the Party group of the Federation, directed the activities from behind the scenes.

Wang Ying, Shi Qing, Qian Feng, and other right-wing elements within the Party, colluded with some right-wing elements outside the Party, using the slogan of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" to oppose the Party's leadership over literary and art undertakings. Their main arguments were fivefold: First, the Party can lead literary and art undertakings, but also cannot lead literary and art undertakings. Second, the Party's leadership is not needed when implementing the "blooming" and "contending" policy. Third, they opposed the "having a clear idea" approach of editorial departments of literary publications in their work. Fourth, they advocated running "coterie publications" to break away from the Party's leadership. Fifth, they opposed criticizing poisonous weeds.

Under the control of Wang Ying and others, "Jianghuai Literature" had been veering to the right since March, publishing many poisonous works. When the Anhui Daily criticized these works, they launched a frenzied attack on the Anhui Daily and the Provincial Party Committee. They falsely accused the critics of being sectarian and dogmatic, and opposed the conclusion of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee on the issue of this criticism. They not only used "Jianghuai Literature" as a battleground, sending many covert arrows to the critics and the Party, but also secretly plotted to print materials and distribute them to the Central government and neighboring provinces and cities to undermine the prestige of the Provincial Party Committee; they spread fallacies everywhere, slandering the Provincial Party Committee as being an opponent of the Central government in implementing the "blooming" and "contending" policy; and they used the platform of the Provincial Party Committee's propaganda work conference in an attempt to overturn the Provincial Party Committee's above-mentioned conclusion. Shi Qing admitted that their "minimum program" was to have the Party accept their revisionism and examine itself and admit its mistakes to them.

Under the exposure and refutation of the broad masses, some members of this right-wing anti-Party clique have begun to make confessions, while others are still refusing to examine themselves and make confessions. The struggle is continuing.

    妄图取消党的领导　要党对修正主义投降
    安徽文联反党集团阴谋败露
    本报讯　安徽省文艺界在反右派斗争中，揭露了省文联的右派反党集团。这个集团的核心分子是文联党组委员王影，“江淮文学”副主编、文联党组委员石青和“江淮文学”编辑部副主任、共产党员钱锋。文联主席、文联党组书记戴岳则在幕后进行指挥。
    王影、石青、钱锋等党内的右派分子同一些党外的右派分子勾结起来，利用“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的口号，反对党对文艺事业的领导。他们的主要论点有五个：一、党能领导文艺事业也不能领导文艺事业。二、在贯彻“鸣”、“放”方针时不需要党的领导。三、反对文艺刊物编辑部在工作中的“心中有数”。四、主张办“同人刊物”，从而摆脱党的领导。五、反对对毒草进行批评。
    在王影等人的把持下，“江淮文学”从3月份起一直向右转，发表不少有毒的作品。安徽日报对这些作品提出批评，他们就向安徽日报和省委展开猖狂的进攻。他们诬指批评者是宗派主义和教条主义，反对安徽省委关于这次批评问题的结论。他们不仅以“江淮文学”为阵地，向批评者和党发出了许多暗箭，而且密谋印发材料，分送中央和友邻省、市，破坏省委威信；到处散播谬论，诽谤省委在贯彻“鸣”“放”方针方面是中央的反对派；利用省委宣传工作会议的讲坛，企图推翻省委的上述结论。石青承认，他们的“最低纲领”，是要党接受他们的修正主义，向他们来检讨认错。
    在广大群众的揭露和批驳下，现在这一右派反党集团中有人开始作出交代，有人还拒不检查交代，斗争正在继续开展。
