Liu Hongda, Zhang Wenchun, Zhang Zhenfa, Li Yaoxian, Tong Yulan, Wu Fengqi, and Zheng Kuifu stated in a joint speech:

　　Recently, some people have been acting like clowns, trying to portray themselves as representatives of farmers' interests. May I ask, were you the ones who led the overthrow of feudal rule and the distribution of land to farmers? Were you the ones who led the cooperative movement? We farmers have more political experience than you. We know better than anyone who can represent our interests and who can bring us a prosperous life.
　　We fully agree with the government work report and other work reports made by Premier Zhou to the conference and are willing to implement them in future work.
　　We are farmer representatives from Liaoning Province, working in the Sizu Revolution October Society, the Kuandian Locomotive Society, the Shenyang Gaokan Society, the Lingyuan United Society, the Beizhen Red Stone Society, the Hailong Dawn Society, and the Liuhe Friendship First Society. Recently, we have seen some strange discussions in the newspapers, saying "cooperativization has advanced rashly," saying "cooperativization has no superiority," saying "farmers' lives have not improved," and so on. We would like to talk about the situation in our societies and see if they are right or we are doing it right.
　　To say that cooperativization has advanced rashly means that our cooperatives were established too quickly, too large, and too poorly. We do not agree with this statement. Take the Revolution October Society as an example, it now has 2,109 households, more than 10,000 people, and more than 2,900 hectares of land. It seems to be quite large, but there are reasons for being large. This society was initially started in 1949 by five poor farmers and one middle farmer organizing mutual aid teams. There were many difficulties at that time, with five of the six households lacking food. However, everyone worked together to dig soil, accumulate fertilizer, raise pigs, and operate flour mills. After a year, they achieved a great harvest, with the average yield per hectare increasing from 2,100 jin to 2,813 jin. At this time, others also saw the benefits and were willing to work with us, so a primary cooperative was established in 1951, expanding to 172 households. By 1955, everyone felt that in order to further increase production and income, it was necessary to develop paddy fields, build reservoirs, and develop diversified operations. However, this could not be done with the strength of a primary cooperative, and it was necessary to merge the small cooperatives to establish advanced cooperatives. Soon, Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperativization was published, and we merged 33 cooperatives to form an advanced cooperative. In the first year after the merger, due to the adoption of various production increase measures, increased manure and fertilizer, and good weather, the average yield per hectare reached more than 6,200 jin, an increase of more than 31% compared to before the merger. The other six societies are the same as the Revolution October Society, all developed from small to large, from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. We believe that such development is normal. There are also some cooperatives near us that are not as well-established as we are, but were established all at once, but what's wrong with that? They don't fundamentally understand cooperatives, they have seen them for several years, and they are doing very well, none of them have collapsed, production has increased, and income has increased. Since production has increased and income has increased, why do you say that cooperativization has advanced rashly? Are we doing something wrong? Some people say that cooperativization is not good, but we ourselves are very happy because cooperativization has eradicated our roots of poverty. Things that we could not even dream of when working individually can now be done. We are no longer afraid of bankruptcy and begging for food. Those who can truly work can earn more, and those who are helpless can enjoy the "five guarantees." In a word, cooperativization is a great thing! Of course, we also have some shortcomings and errors, such as the relationship between the cooperative and its members still having some problems, some members not taking good enough care of the cooperative's public property, diversified operations not being widely developed, and sometimes overemphasizing the interests of the cooperative in dealing with the relationship between the state and the cooperative. But this cannot be confused with rash advances.
　　As for some people saying that "cooperativization has no superiority" and "farmers' lives have not improved," we believe this is nonsense. Take the Revolution October Society as an example, last year, more than 200 mu of paddy fields were developed from low-lying ponds that had never been touched before, and 131 wells were dug in dry land. After cooperativization, 92% of the members increased their income. Due to increased investment in production, the society also bought a diesel engine, a water pump, added 86 livestock, 17 rubber-wheeled carts, and 45 waterwheels. Without cooperativization, there would be no such great strength. This was unimaginable in the past. What is this if not superiority? The Friendship Society built three reservoirs and opened 1,300 mu of paddy fields. Last year, they overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest, with the income from labor days increasing from an average of 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 4 jiao, an increase of 100%. The Dawn Society built ten reservoirs and opened 10,000 mu of paddy fields. Before cooperativization, the three reservoirs could only irrigate 250 hectares of land, but now they can irrigate 400 hectares due to rational use. The Locomotive Society was originally a poor mountain valley. When the society was established in 1955, it still needed the state to supply grain. After cooperativization, due to increased production, it not only did not need the state to supply it, but also sold 1.2 million jin of surplus grain to the state. 80% of the members have improved to the living standards of middle peasants. In the years before cooperativization, the United Society only afforested more than 300 mu and planted 9,000 fruit trees. In the first year after cooperativization, it afforested 530 mu and planted more than 10,000 fruit trees. The Red Stone Society turned the previous winding mountain roads into a 5-meter-wide, 25-li-long highway, and the yield of cotton per hectare increased from 2,600 jin to 3,727 jin. After cooperativization, the Gaokan Society opened more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields, and the yield increased by 20%. The average income of members per labor day increased from 1 yuan and 2 jiao to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. If cooperativization is not realized, it is absolutely impossible to achieve such great achievements. What is this if not superiority?
　　Let's talk about how our lives are going. As Chairman Mao said, our living standards are generally not high, but they have indeed improved compared to before liberation and before cooperativization, and have improved a lot. Before liberation, if life was difficult, we had to borrow usurious loans, and if there was no other way, we had to beg for food. Now, not only is the life of ordinary farmers guaranteed, but also the helpless and unable to work farmers are not worried about food and clothing. Before cooperativization, these societies of ours all had households lacking food, but now there are none, and many members have also built new houses. The old farmers have a particularly deep understanding of these changes. In addition to these, the purchase of industrial products is also very different from before. Before cooperativization, there was a surplus of cloth coupons, not because they could not be used, but because they could not be afforded. Now there is no surplus. Some industrial products that could only be sold in cities in the past are now also used by us. For example, the Revolution October Society bought 80 sewing machines last year, and 70% of the members bought thermos bottles. The Red Stone Society has 800 flashlights for 400 households. The Friendship Society had only one pair of leather shoes in a production team in the past, but now each household has an average of two pairs. If life has not improved, can there be spare money to buy these things? Here, we would like to talk about the issue of pigs separately. In the past, farmers also raised pigs, but they could not afford to eat them. Now it is different. We not only slaughter pigs during festivals, but also at ordinary times. Especially during the Spring Festival, even more are slaughtered. We calculated that the Gaokan Society slaughters an average of one pig for every four households (this is the least), the Friendship Society slaughters an average of one pig for every two households, the Red Stone Society can allocate an average of 100 jin of meat per household, and the households that slaughter pigs in the Revolution October Society and the Locomotive Society account for more than 80%. The reason why pork cannot be bought in cities, in addition to the increase in the urban population and the increase in pork consumption, is because the supply of pigs from rural areas to cities has decreased. The reason for the decrease is, firstly, that farmers are living a better life and want to eat more themselves to improve their lives; secondly, before the price increase, farmers had opinions about the price, so they were unwilling to sell or unwilling to raise more. After the increase in the price of pigs, the number of pigs sold and raised has increased. In the future, in addition to our own consumption, we must also guarantee the supply to cities and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. I heard that there is someone in Beijing who said that pork and other things were all eaten by those who used to "wear broken shoes." He meant that they were all eaten by cadres, right? That's not the case at all. Take Shenyang as an example, the supply is extremely small at ordinary times, and only half a jin is supplied to each person during the Spring Festival. It is obvious that they want to slander our state cadres. If it is said that they were all eaten by farmers who used to "wear broken shoes," that's about right. We would like to ask this intellectual, why are you so hostile to farmers who used to "wear broken shoes?" Are you so unhappy that farmers' lives have improved? There are also people in our village who say this kind of thing, and they are the bad eggs who used to ride on our heads in the old society and the landlord elements who are unwilling to honestly reform through labor.
　　Now, not only has our material life improved, but our cultural life has also improved. If there are still people who look at our rural areas with the eyes of "uncultured poor mountain valleys," their understanding is lagging behind. Six of our seven societies have installed wired broadcasting, and each society has a ball field, library, amateur theater troupe, and health clinic. During rest, members can listen to domestic and foreign news and entertainment programs, visit the library to read books and magazines, play ball on the ball field, or watch their own performances. Those who are sick can go to the society's health clinic for treatment. Children in the society can all go to elementary school. Families of farmers who have not studied for generations also have middle school and college students.
　　Of course, we should also explain that in the case of improving life, there are also some phenomena of insufficient thrift or waste. In the old society, farmers would try to save money to prepare for old age or to save for their children. Now that cooperativization has taken place, there is no need to worry about old age, and as long as the children can work when they grow up, they can live independently, so some members spend money lavishly when they have money, and many people buy things that are not urgently needed such as watches and bicycles. This requires strengthening the education of hard work and simplicity. We should not be extravagant and wasteful just because life has just gotten a little better. We should still be thrifty, save the money that is saved, and plan to allocate it in order to expand production and make our lives better.
　　So, are there people in our cooperatives whose income has decreased? Yes. But let's see how many there are and what the reasons are. The households with reduced income in the United Society account for 3.7%, the Gaokan Society accounts for 8%, and the most is no more than 10%. Most of these households are well-to-do middle peasants or have many people but few laborers. Before cooperativization, they had more land, had carts and horses, and engaged in sideline occupations. After joining the society, the land is not divided into dividends, and the carts and horses belong to the society, so their income is less than before. Although some well-to-do households have reduced their income compared to before, their lives have not been affected. The society also provides appropriate subsidies to those who have difficulties. To say that "cooperativization has no superiority" and "farmers' lives have not improved" because these households have reduced their income is to deliberately exaggerate the facts and obliterate the achievements. If not because of these, then no basis can be found. Recently, some people have been acting in a way that makes us both angry and funny. To put it bluntly, they are acting like clowns, trying to portray themselves as representatives of farmers' interests, as if they care about farmers more than the Communist Party. So may I ask: were you the ones who led the overthrow of feudal rule and the distribution of land to farmers? Were you the ones who led the cooperative movement? These right-wing elements are really overestimating themselves. We farmers have more political experience than you. We know better than anyone who can represent our interests and who can bring us a prosperous life. Although the living standards of our farmers are not yet too high and are far from our ideals, we are fully confident that under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, through our hard work, our ideals can be realized.

　　右派小丑们太不自量力了
    刘洪达、张文春、张振发、李耀先、佟玉兰、吴凤岐、郑奎福在联合发言中指出：
    最近有些人的表现，真像个小丑似的，他们硬要把自己装成代表农民利益的样子。请问，打倒封建统治、分给农民土地是你领导的吗？搞合作化运动是你领导的吗？我们农民比你们有政治经验，谁能代表农民的利益，谁给农民带来富裕的生活，我们农民比谁都清楚。
    我们完全同意周总理向大会所作的政府工作报告和其他各项工作报告，并愿在今后工作中贯彻执行。
    我们是辽宁省来的农民代表，分别在绥中革命十月社、宽甸火车头社、沈阳高坎社、凌源联合社、北镇红石社、海龙曙光社、柳河友谊一社工作。最近在报上看到了一些奇怪的议论，说“合作化冒进了”，说“合作化没有优越性”，说“农民生活没提高”，等等。我们想把我们几个社的情况谈一谈，看看是他们说对了，还是我们做对了。
    说合作化冒进的意思，就是说我们合作社办快了办大了办糟了。我们不同意这个说法。就拿革命十月社为例，现在有二千一百零九户，一万多人口，二千九百多垧土地。看来是不算小，但是大也有大的理由。这个社最初是一九四九年由五户贫农一户中农组织互助组干起来的。当时困难很多，六户中就有五户缺粮，但是大家齐心合力挖土积肥、养猪、开粉房干了一年，秋后就得了个大丰收，平均每垧产量由二千一百斤提高到二千八百一十三斤。这时别人也看出门道来了，都愿意和我们在一起干，所以就在一九五一年建立了初级社，扩大到一百七十二户。到一九五五年，这时大家都觉得要想再提高产量增加收入，就必须开水田、修水库和发展多种经营不可。但是这靠初级社的力量是做不到的，必须把小社合并建立高级社。不久毛主席关于农业合作化的报告公布了，我们就把三十三个社合并组成高级社。合并后第一年，由于采取了各项增产措施，增加了粪肥，加上年景也好，所以平均每垧产量达到六千二百多斤，比合并前提高百分之三十一还多。其他六个社也和革命十月社相同，都是由小到大，由初级社到高级社办起来的，像这样的发展我们认为是正常的。我们附近也有的社不像我们这样比较有基础，而是一下子就办起来的，但是这又有什么不好呢？他们不是根本不懂合作社，他们已经看到了好几年了，他们搞的也很好，一个也没垮，生产也提高了，收入也增加了。既然生产提高了，收入增加了，为什么还说合作化冒进了呢？难道我们干的不对吗？有人说合作化不好，但是我们自己都高兴得很，因为合作化把我们的穷根挖掉了，单干的时候作梦也想不到的事情现在可以办到了，再也不怕破产讨饭了，真正能劳动的可以多得了，无依无靠的可以享受“五保”了。一句话，合作化是一件天大的好事！当然我们也有一些缺点和错误，像社与社员关系上仍存在一些问题，有些社员对社的公共财物爱护得不够，多种经营没有广泛的开展起来，在对待国家与合作社的关系上，有时过分强调社的利益等。但这不能和冒进混在一起。    
    至于有人说“合作化没有优越性”、“农民生活没提高”，我们认为这是胡说八道。以革命十月社为例，去年把从来没人动的涝洼塘开成二百多亩水田，在旱地上打了一百三十一眼井。在合作化以后，有百分之九十二的社员增加了收入。由于生产投资增加，社里还买了一台柴油机，一台水泵，新添了八十六匹牲口，十七台胶轮大车，四十五台水车。要是没有合作化，就没有这样大的力量。这在过去连想都不敢想，这不是优越性是什么？友谊社修起了三座水库，开了水田一千三百亩，去年战胜了旱灾获得大丰收，劳动日的收入由平均七角提高到一元四角，增加了一倍。曙光社修起十座水库，开了一万亩水田，合作化前三个水库只能灌溉二百五十垧地，现在由于做到了合理使用就能灌溉四百垧地。火车头社本来是个穷山沟，一九五五年建社时还要由国家供应粮食，合作化后由于增加了生产，不但不须要国家供应了，还卖给国家一百二十万斤余粮。有百分之八十的社员提高到中农的生活水平。联合社在合作化以前的几年里，只造林三百多亩，栽果树九千棵。合作化以后第一年，就造林五百三十亩，栽果树一万多棵。红石社把以前的弯曲山道修成了五米多宽二十五华里长的公路，棉花每垧产量由二千六百斤提高到三千七百二十七斤。高坎社合作化以后开水田二千多亩，产量提高了百分之二十，社员每个劳动日的平均收入由一元二角提高到二元一角。如果不实现合作化，要想取得这样巨大的成就是绝对办不到的。这不是优越性是什么呢？
    再谈谈我们的生活到底是怎么了呢？正像毛主席所说的，我们的生活水平一般是不高的，但是比解放前比合作化前确实提高了，而且提高得很不少。解放前生活困难就得借高利贷，实在没办法就得要饭，现在不但一般农民生活有了保障，就是无依无靠不能劳动的农民也不愁吃穿了。合作化前我们这几个社都有缺粮户，现在没有了，并且有许多社员还盖上了新房子。这些变化，老农民的体会是特别深刻的。除了这些以外，在购买工业品上也和以前大不相同了。合作化前布票有剩余，不是用不了而是买不起。现在没有剩余了。有些过去只能在城市推销的工业品，现在我们也用上了。如革命十月社，去年一年就买进八十台缝纫机，有百分之七十社员买暖水瓶。红石社四百户就有八百个手电筒。友谊社一个生产队过去只有一双皮鞋，现在平均一户就有两双。如果生活没提高，能有闲钱买这些东西吗？在这里我们想单谈一下猪的问题。过去农民也养猪，但是吃不起。现在不同了，我们不但逢年、过节要杀猪，就是平常也有杀的。特别是春节杀的更多。我们算了一下，高坎社是平均四户杀一口猪（这是最少的），友谊社平均两户杀一口，红石社平均每户能摊一百斤肉，革命十月社和火车头社的杀猪户占百分之八十以上。城市所以买不到猪肉，除了城市人口增加，猪肉消费量增大以外，就是因为农村供应城市的猪减少了。减少的原因，一来是农民日子过好了。想自己多吃点改善生活；二来是在没提价以前，农民对价格有意见，所以不愿卖或不愿多养。提高猪价以后，卖猪和养猪的数量都有增加，今后除了我们自己吃用以外，一定还要保证供应城市，加强工农联盟。听说北京有个什么人，说猪肉之类的东西都让过去“穿破鞋”的吃了，他的意思是说都让干部吃了，对么？根本不是这么回事。以沈阳为例，平时供应极少，过年才每人供应半斤。很明显他们是要诬蔑我们的国家干部。如果是说都让过去“穿破鞋”的农民吃了那还差不多。我们倒很想问问这位大知识分子，你对过去“穿破鞋”的农民怎么这样仇视呢？农民生活改善了你们就这么不高兴吗？在我们村里也有说这种话的，那是些旧社会骑在我们头上的坏蛋和不肯老老实实劳动改造的地主分子。
    现在，我们不仅物质生活改善了，文化生活也改善了，要是还有人以“没文化的穷山沟”的眼光来看我们农村，他的认识就算落后了。我们七个社中有六个社安上了有线广播，社社都有球场、图书室、业余剧团和卫生所。社员在休息的时候，可以听到国内外新闻和文娱节目，可以到图书室看看图书杂志，可以到球场上玩玩球，或看看自己演出的剧。有病的可以到社里的卫生所去治疗。社里的儿童都能上小学。几辈子没念书的农民家里也有中学生和大学生了。
    当然，我们也应该说明，在改善生活的情况下，也存在着某些不够节约或者浪费的现象。旧社会农民有了钱都想法积攒起来以备防老或给子女积蓄。现在合作化了，都不必为养老担心了，子女长大了只要能劳动就能独立生活，所以有些社员有了钱就大手大脚的花了，有很多人买手表、自行车等不急需的东西。这是要加强艰苦朴素的教育工作的，不能因为日子刚过好一点就铺张浪费，还应该俭朴，把节约下来的钱积攒起来，有计划的支配，以便扩大生产把我们的日子过得更好。
    那么，我们合作社里有没有人收入减少了的呢？有。但是要看看有多少，是什么原因。联合社减少收入的户占百分之三点七，高坎社占百分之八，最多的不超过百分之十。这些户大部分是富裕中农或人口多劳力少的，他们在合作化前土地较多有车马搞副业，入社后，土地不分红了，车马入社，所以他们的收入比以前减少了。有些富裕户虽然收入比以前减少，但生活并未受到影响。对其中有困难的，社里也给适当的补助。因为这些户减少了收入，就说“合作化没有优越性”、“农民生活未提高”，那是有意夸大事实，抹杀成绩。如果不是因为这些，那就更找不到任何根据。最近有些人的表现，真是让我们又好气又好笑，说得不客气点，真像个小丑似的，他们硬要把自己装成代表农民利益的样子，好像他比共产党还关心农民。那么请问：打倒封建统治，分给农民土地是你领导的吗？搞合作化运动是你领导的吗？这些右派分子真是太不自量了。我们农民比你们有政治经验，谁能代表农民的利益，谁给农民带来富裕的生活，我们农民比谁都清楚。虽然现在我们农民的生活水平还不算太高，跟我们的理想还相差很远。但是，我们完全有信心，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，经过我们的艰苦奋斗，我们的理想是能实现的。
