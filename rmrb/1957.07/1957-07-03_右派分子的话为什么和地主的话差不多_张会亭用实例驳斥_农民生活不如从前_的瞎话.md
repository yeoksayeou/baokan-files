Why do the words of rightists sound similar to those of landlords?
Zhang Huiting refutes the nonsense that "farmers' lives are worse than before" with examples.

I am the director of the Huaiying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingshang County, Anhui Province. I am not good at speaking, so I can only say what I have and talk about the actual situation in the countryside.

Our Huaibei area is an old disaster area. In the eight years since liberation, we farmers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao, have turned over, overcome severe natural disasters. Although life is still difficult, it is a world apart from before liberation.

Before liberation, the reactionary government did not care about the life or death of the people. During the great flood of 1931, many farmers fled famine, begging for food, and families were scattered. In our Chentun Village, 68 out of 163 households fled, nine children were sold, and three wives were sold. Seventeen people died from hunger and cold. After liberation, the flood of 1954 was even greater than that of 1931, but with the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we carried out production for self-salvation, and with the strong support of the state, no one in our village fled the famine or begged for food, and no one sold their wives or children or died of hunger or cold. Even the three who sold their wives, except for one who was older and did not find one, the other two found wives and started families after liberation. The masses said, "The Communist Party and the People's Government are more thoughtful than our parents. They have helped us with food, clothing, fuel, housing, salt, medicine, livestock feed, seeds, and fertilizer." It would have been impossible to overcome these major natural disasters without the Communist Party and the People's Government.

In recent years, we have not only overcome natural disasters but also greatly improved our lives. Taking food as an example, before liberation, our poor farmers were short of food every year, eating chaff and wild vegetables, and fleeing famine to make a living. Now, every household has enough food to eat and can even eat refined rice and fine flour. Households in difficulty have received relief, and the widowed, orphaned, and childless elderly without labor have implemented the "Five Guarantees." During the Spring Festival this year, every family had fish and meat, which was unheard of before liberation! In terms of clothing, before liberation, more than 20 households in the village did not have quilts to cover themselves, more than 90 people relied on burrowing in grass nests in winter, and more than 50 people were naked and exposed in winter without cotton trousers. Now, every family has added new quilts, and everyone has added new clothes. Clothes with "patches piled like mountains" can no longer be seen. In terms of housing, before liberation, more than 40 peasant households in our village did not have houses, and some only had small thatched huts that did not keep out the rain or wind. Now, every family has a house. Chen Guojun's family of six, who used to borrow half a thatched hut from others, has now built three new main rooms and a kitchen. In terms of culture, before liberation, only 26 children of landlords and rich peasants in the village attended primary school. Now, there are more than 260 people in the village studying in primary schools, middle schools, winter schools, and night schools. Even those who used to work as hired laborers and beg for food can learn culture, and some entire families have become literate. In the past, peasants did not have money to treat illnesses, "small illnesses were delayed, and big illnesses were waited for." Now, everyone can get medical treatment. In February this year, half of our cooperative suffered from influenza. The government sent more than 20 doctors to rescue us overnight. Those who were seriously ill were sent to the hospital, and 90% received free treatment. Furthermore, the unified purchase and sale of grain has brought endless benefits to our poor farmers. In the past, landlords, rich peasants, and speculators hoarded grain, raised grain prices, and lent money at usurious interest rates. "Rolling donkey" interest rates meant borrowing one dou of miscellaneous grain before wheat harvest and having to repay two or three dou of wheat after the harvest. Farmers knew they were at a disadvantage but still had to borrow. Many people were so exploited that they could not lift their heads or turn over. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the government controlled the grain, guaranteed supply to grain-deficient households, and stabilized grain prices. Those landlords, rich peasants, and profiteers could no longer take the opportunity to exploit the peasants. The above is the situation of changes in our farmers' lives. Of course, some people in the countryside have also experienced a decline in their living standards. These are the landlords and rich peasants who used to live off exploitation. Even this is a minority. Anyone who has been reformed and works hard can get the same income as ordinary members. Some with strong labor power can even earn more.

Below, I will talk about the production situation of our cooperative.

Our village established a primary cooperative in 1952 and transitioned to a advanced cooperative in the autumn of 1955. In the past, our poor farmers lacked plowing cattle and farm tools, planting could not be timely, and disaster resistance was very small. "Planting in the land, harvesting in the sky," production was not guaranteed. Now, after joining the cooperative, land, labor, draft animals, and farm tools are uniformly arranged. With the strong support of the government, we can concentrate our efforts, seize the time, and carry out production according to local conditions and seasons. Last autumn, our cooperative converted more than 3,000 mu of low-lying land that could not guarantee a harvest of dry crops into rice paddies. Other crops were also planted in a timely manner. The members also actively worked hard to prevent and resist disasters. Therefore, although we suffered from waterlogging and typhoon disasters, we still increased production by 25% compared to the autumn of 1955. In addition, the cooperative also vigorously developed various sideline productions, planting melons and vegetables to support the cities and increase the income of the members. Everyone said, "Organizing together gives us great strength, and we are not afraid of disasters." This spring, we also carried out cooperative rectification, solved some problems existing in the cooperative, and implemented contracting work to teams, guaranteeing output, rewarding overproduction, and compensating for reduced production, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the members. During the summer harvest and planting, everyone got up at five in the morning and went to bed in the middle of the night, competing to work hard. In order to seize the time for planting, some production teams even organized people to pull plows. It is estimated that this year's summer harvest will increase by 30% to 40% compared to the bumper year of 1955, and if there are no major disasters in the autumn, production will definitely increase.

Not long ago, I inspected nine agricultural production cooperatives in Funan and Huoqiu counties. Their crops were also very good, the production morale of the members was very high, and the cadres were able to participate in production together with the members after this spring's cooperative rectification. Although some had some shortcomings in their work, they often held meetings, promoted democracy, allowed the masses to make suggestions, and corrected them in a timely manner. In general, in our area along the Huai River, this year, not only is production much better than last year, but the agricultural cooperatives are also better and more consolidated than last year.

Before coming to the meeting, when we were transplanting rice seedlings, the newspaper reader read the news in the newspaper that Zhang Bojun and others opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, opposed socialism, and said that our farmers' lives were worse than before. I heard that some of these people were ministers of the Central People's Government. At that time, we were all very angry when we heard this. When I passed by the Provincial Department of Agriculture on my way to this meeting, a Deputy Director Zhang Jie also said to me: The lives of the peasants are too hard, the "Three Reforms" were badly reformed, the cadres oppress the masses, and so on. I don't know why these big cadres tell lies without looking at the facts? Why do they say things similar to those of the landlords and rich peasants who oppose our emancipated farmers? Our farmers are resolutely opposed to these reactionary remarks. We are determined to take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, and we will absolutely not allow anyone to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party or oppose socialism.

    右派分子的话为什么和地主的话差不多
    张会亭用实例驳斥“农民生活不如从前”的瞎话
    我是安徽省颍上县淮颍农业生产合作社的社主任，讲不好话，只能有啥说啥，讲一点农村的实际情况。
    俺们淮北是个老灾区，解放以来八年天灾，俺们农民在中国共产党、人民政府和毛主席的领导下，得到了翻身，战胜了严重的灾荒，生活虽然还有困难，但和解放前比起来真要强十万八千里了。
    解放前，反动政府是根本不管人民死活的，1931年大水灾，很多农民逃荒要饭，妻离子散，俺们陈屯村一百六十三户就逃荒六十八户，卖小孩子九个，卖老婆三个，因饿、冻死亡十七个。解放后，1954年的水灾比1931年还大，但是有共产党、人民政府领导俺们生产自救，有国家的大力支持，俺们全村没有一个逃荒要饭的，更没有一个卖老婆、卖孩子和饿死、冻死的，就连那三个卖老婆的，除了一个年纪较大的未找外，另外两个在解放后都又找到了老婆成了家。群众说：“共产党、人民政府比爹娘想的还周到，吃的、穿的、烧的、住的、食盐、医药、牲口草料、种子肥料都帮助到了。”没有共产党和人民政府，要战胜这几次大灾荒是不可能的。
    这几年俺们不单是战胜了灾荒，还大大提高了生活。拿吃的来说，解放前俺们贫苦农民年年断粮，吃糠咽菜，逃荒要饭的糊日子；现在家家户户都有粮吃，还能吃到精米细面，困难户都得到了救济，鳏寡孤独没有劳动力的都实行了五保，今年过春节时家家都有鱼有肉，这在解放前那有过呢！拿穿的来说，解放前全村有二十多户没有被子盖，九十多人冬天靠钻草窝，五十多人赤皮露肉，冬天穿不上棉裤；现在家家都添新被子，人人都添新衣服，妇女、小孩还穿花衣服，“补钉山”的衣服已经看不到了。拿住的来说，解放前俺村有四十多户农民没有房子，有的只有一个小草庵子，上不遮雨，下不挡风；现在家家都有了房子，贫农陈国钧家六口人，过去借住人家半间草庵子，现在盖了三间新堂屋，还有一间锅屋。拿文化来说，解放前全村只有二十六个地主、富农的孩子上小学；现在全村在小学、中学、冬学、夜校学习的共有二百六十多人，打过长工要过饭的也都能学文化了，有的全家都识了字。过去农民生病没有钱治，“小病拖，大病等”；现在都能得到医治，今年二月俺社有一半人得了流行性感冒，政府派了二十多个医生连夜抢救，重的送进医院，90％都得到免费治疗。再拿粮食统购统销来说，给俺们贫苦农民带来的好处真是说不尽。过去地主、富农、投机商人囤积粮食，抬高粮价，放高利贷，“驴打滚”的利息，麦前借一斗杂粮，麦后就要还二、三斗小麦，农民明知吃亏也要借，很多人被剥削得抬不起来头，翻不过来身。实行粮食统购统销后，政府掌握了粮食，对缺粮户保证供应，粮价稳定，那些地主、富农、奸商再也不能乘机剥削农民了。以上就是俺们农民生活变化的情况。当然在农村里也有些人生活下降了，这就是那些过去靠吃剥削饭的地主、富农，就这也是少数的，凡是经过改造努力劳动的，也都可以和一般社员得到同样的收入，有些劳动力强的收入还要多些。
    下面再谈谈俺社的生产情况。
    俺村在一九五二年就办了初级社，一九五五年秋转为高级社。过去俺们贫苦农民缺少耕牛、农具，播种不能及时，抗灾力量很小，“种在地，收在天”，生产没有保障。现在入社后，土地、劳力、耕畜、农具都统一安排，加上政府的大力支持，就能够集中力量，抓住时间，因地因时制宜的搞生产，去年秋季俺社把种旱粮不能保收的洼地改种水稻三千多亩，其他庄稼也都种的及时，社员们又积极努力防灾抗灾，所以虽然受了内涝和台风灾害，还比1955年秋季增产两成五。另外，社里还大力开展了各种副业生产，种植瓜、菜支援城市，增加社员收入。大家都说：“组织起来力量大，受灾也不怕”。今春俺们又进行了整社，解决了社里存在的一些问题，实行了包工包产，超产归队，减产赔偿，更大大地鼓励了社员的生产积极性，夏收夏种时大家都是起五更睡半夜，争先恐后的干，为了抓住时间播种，有的生产队还组织了人拉犁。估计今年午季比1955年丰收年成还要增产三、四成，秋季如不发生大灾，也一定可以增产。
    不久以前，我到阜南、霍丘两县视察了九个农业生产合作社，他们的庄稼也都很好，社员的生产情绪都很高，干部在今春整社后都能和社员一起参加生产，工作上虽然有的有些缺点，但都经常开会，发扬民主，让群众提意见，及时进行纠正。总的说，在俺们沿淮一带，今年不单是生产比去年搞的好得多，农业社办的也比去年更好更巩固了。
    来开会前，俺们插秧时，读报员读了报上登的章伯钧等人反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，说俺们农民生活不如从前的消息，听说这些人有的还是中央人民政府的部长，当时俺们听了都很气愤。这次来开会经过省农业厅时，有个张节副厅长也向我说：农民生活太苦，“三改”改坏了，干部压迫群众等等。我不知道像这些大干部为啥都不看事实讲瞎话？为啥和那些反对俺们翻身农民的地主、富农说的话差不多？俺们农民是坚决反对这些反动言论的，俺们坚决地在共产党的领导下走社会主义的路，任何人要是反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，俺们是绝对不能允许的。
