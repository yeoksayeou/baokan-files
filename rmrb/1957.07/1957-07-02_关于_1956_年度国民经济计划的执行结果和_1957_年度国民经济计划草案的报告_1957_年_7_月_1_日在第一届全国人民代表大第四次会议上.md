I hereby present to the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress a report on the execution results of the 1956 national economic plan and the draft of the 1957 national economic plan for your review.

I. On the Execution Results of the 1956 National Economic Plan

The 1956 national economic plan was formulated under the following conditions. Starting from the second half of 1955, a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce emerged in China. This high tide greatly promoted the high tide of socialist construction, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses soared to an unprecedented level, demanding the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. The bumper harvest of 1955 saw the highest increase in grain and cotton production in the past three years. In the first three years of implementing the First Five-Year Plan, there was a certain surplus in fiscal resources, a certain reserve in material resources, a certain growth in technical strength, and relatively good preparations in basic construction design, equipment, and construction organization. The 1956 plan adapted to this new situation, thus ensuring the great victory of socialist transformation in fiscal and economic terms and guaranteeing the smooth development of socialist construction. The indicators set in the plan were very ambitious. It can be said that this plan basically reflected the aspirations of the people in the great revolutionary and construction high tide.

The people of the entire country are very concerned about the execution results of the 1956 national economic plan. Now, based on the inspection of the plan's execution results, we can report to the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress that the various indicators of the 1956 national economic plan of our country have been completed or overfulfilled.

1956 was a year of great institutional change in our country. Nationwide, 756,000 agricultural production cooperatives were organized, with 96.3% of the total number of rural households joining, of which 87.8% joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Nationwide, approximately 100,000 handicraft production cooperatives and production groups were organized, with over 5 million people participating, accounting for about 92% of the total number of handicraft workers. In the capitalist industry nationwide, enterprises accounting for 99.6% of the output value and 99% of the total number of employees were transformed into joint state-private enterprises. In the capitalist commerce nationwide, enterprises accounting for 82.2% of the total number of businesses and 85.1% of the total number of employees were transformed into state-owned, cooperative, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperative stores and groups. Due to this great transformation, our country basically resolved the contradiction between individual economy and socialist industrialization, basically resolved the contradiction between capitalist ownership and socialist ownership, and thus basically ended the history of the exploitative class system that has lasted for thousands of years in our country, establishing a socialist economic system. In this way, the task of transforming the ownership of the means of production from private to public in our country was basically completed.

Under the impetus of the high tide of socialist revolution, the socialist construction cause of our country also achieved great development.

The total industrial output value for 1956 was 586.6 billion yuan, an increase of 31% over the previous year, making it the year with the fastest industrial production growth in recent years. Of the total industrial output value, the production of means of production was 291.7 billion yuan, an increase of 41.7% over the previous year; the production of consumer goods was 294.9 billion yuan, an increase of 22% over the previous year. The production of the machinery manufacturing industry was 57.6 billion yuan, an increase of 90.2% over the previous year. The production of handicrafts was 117 billion yuan, an increase of 16% over the previous year.

Calculated by the total industrial output value, the Five-Year Plan (i.e., the indicators set for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan) was completed one year ahead of schedule and exceeded by 9.5%. Of the 46 major industrial products listed in the Five-Year Plan, the production of 27 products such as pig iron, steel, steel materials, caustic soda, soda ash, ammonium nitrate, penicillin, chloromycetin, various sulfonamides, automobile tires, steam boilers, steam turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, generators, electric motors, transformers, metal-cutting machine tools, double-wheel plows, grain sowing machines, passenger cars, bicycles, machine-made paper, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and sackcloth has been completed or exceeded one year ahead of schedule. In 1956, our country successfully developed over 1,200 new industrial products, according to the statistics of nine industrial ministries. Among them, jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, a complete set of 15,000-kilowatt water turbine power generation equipment, 12,000-kilowatt steam turbines and steam generators, single-axis automatic lathes, high-temperature alloy steel, etc., are all products that use the latest technology in the world and are produced in China for the first time. Now, these products have not only been successfully developed but have also been put into production. The main technical and economic indicators and the utilization rates of major industrial equipment in various industrial departments have all shown significant improvements over the previous year.

In 1956, the industrial enterprises managed by various industrial ministries (excluding the Ministry of Forestry) reduced their production costs by 10.7% compared to the previous year. After deducting the factors of reduced transfer prices, the reduction was 7.9% (the original plan was to reduce by 8.4%), and the plan was not completed. The labor productivity of production workers increased by approximately 26% compared to the previous year (the original plan was to increase by 18.6%). It should be noted that the labor productivity calculated based on production workers cannot fully reflect the overall situation of industrial labor productivity improvement. Because in industrial enterprises, in addition to production workers, there are also many non-direct production employees. Currently, in our country's industrial enterprises, the number of non-direct production employees is too high, generally accounting for about half of the total number of production workers. This unreasonable situation should be gradually changed. We are also studying and improving methods for more reasonable calculation of industrial labor productivity.

The total agricultural and sideline output value for 1956 was 582.9 billion yuan, which was 96% of the plan and an increase of 4.9% over the previous year. In 1956, our country suffered the most severe natural disaster in recent decades, with some crops suffering significant losses. The area of affected farmland was approximately 230 million mu, and the affected population was approximately 70 million. However, due to the victory of agricultural cooperativization and the publication of the "Outline for the Development of Agriculture in China (Draft) for 1956-1967," a nationwide agricultural production movement was launched among the farmers, achieving significant results in expanding the area of farmland irrigation, increasing the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland, fine farming, and promoting superior varieties. In disaster-stricken areas, the broad masses of farmers fought against the disaster, reducing the losses caused by the disaster, and thus the total production of major crops such as grain and soybeans still increased. The total grain production in 1956 was 365 billion jin, an increase of 15.4 billion jin over the previous year, a growth of 4.4%; the soybean production was 204.7 billion jin, an increase of 22 billion jin over the previous year, a growth of 12.2%; the cotton production was 28.9 million dan, a decrease of 1.47 million dan over the previous year, a decrease of 4.8%; the number of pigs at the end of the year reached 97.8 million, an increase of 9.88 million over the previous year, a growth of 11.2%. The total agricultural and sideline output value in 1956 has basically completed the Five-Year Plan; the total grain production has exceeded the Five-Year Plan.

The investment in basic construction nationwide has increased significantly. In 1956, 139.9 billion yuan was completed, which was 99.9% of the plan and an increase of 53.6 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 62%. This is the year with the highest increase in investment since liberation and the year with the most completed basic construction plans. The cumulative investment in basic construction completed in 1956 and the previous three years has reached approximately 86% of the total investment in the Five-Year Plan. Thus, there is sufficient guarantee for the overfulfillment of the basic construction plan in the Five-Year Plan. In 1956, 625 construction projects of factories and mines above the designated scale were under construction, of which 89 have been fully put into production, including 20 coal mines, 21 power stations, 3 black and non-ferrous metallurgy projects, 4 building materials projects, 21 metal processing and machinery manufacturing projects, and 12 textile and sugar projects. In 1956, 3,108 kilometers of railway were laid, including 1,747 kilometers of new construction, 285 kilometers of restoration, 210 kilometers of new and restored double tracks, and 866 kilometers of new enterprise-dedicated lines (only those constructed by the Ministry of Railways are included). The Baocheng and Yingtan lines have been temporarily opened to traffic. From 1953 to 1956, the cumulative railway construction was 7,532 kilometers, including 4,387 kilometers of new construction, 324 kilometers of restoration, 356 kilometers of new double tracks, 420 kilometers of restored double tracks, and 2,045 kilometers of new enterprise-dedicated lines. The total number of new railway construction has exceeded the total railway construction specified in the Five-Year Plan by 303 kilometers. The results of the implementation of the basic construction plan and the growth of new production capacity in various departments are unprecedented in our country's history. The new steel smelting capacity added in 1956 alone exceeded the total steel smelting capacity before liberation. The machine manufacturing industry, which was almost non-existent in the old China, and the automobile and aircraft manufacturing industries, which were completely non-existent, have now been established. Modern national defense industries have also begun to be established.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of the scale of basic construction, the transportation industry has also developed significantly. In 1956, the national railway freight volume was 24,605 million tons, exceeding the plan by 11.6% and increasing by 27% over the previous year; the cargo turnover volume was 1,203.5 billion ton-kilometers, exceeding the plan by 11.6% and increasing by 22.6% over the previous year. Both have completed the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.

While the economy is developing, the national cultural, educational, health, and scientific research undertakings have also developed significantly in 1956. Higher education enrolled 185,000 students, exceeding the plan by 5.2%; secondary specialized schools enrolled 433,000 students, which was 97.4% of the plan; junior and senior middle schools enrolled 23.43 million students, exceeding the plan by 9.6%; primary and secondary schools enrolled 234.53 million students, an increase of 35.6% over the previous year. The number of students enrolled at the beginning of the school year in various levels of schools has all increased significantly compared to the previous year. The number of students enrolled at the beginning of the school year in secondary specialized schools, middle schools, and primary schools has all exceeded the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.

In 1956, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had 66 scientific research institutions with 4,475 researchers (including research fellows, associate research fellows, assistant research fellows, and research interns). The scientific research work of various universities has been strengthened. The scientific research institutions affiliated with various ministries reached 105, with 10,307 researchers (including engineers and technicians). At the same time, under the leadership of the State Council, scientists have preliminarily formulated the long-term plan for the development of science in China (draft).

In 1956, 176 films were produced, exceeding the plan by 37.5%. There were 6,233 film projection teams, which was 97% of the plan. Newspapers were circulated at 243.942 million printed pages (i.e., broadsheet newspapers), exceeding the plan by 2.2%. Magazines were published at 76.343 million printed pages, which was 89.3% of the plan. Books were published at 435.613 million printed pages, exceeding the plan by 16.2%. All of the above have increased significantly compared to the previous year. In addition, libraries and museums have also developed; arts have flourished further, and folk artists have been better arranged.

In 1956, the total number of hospital beds in the health departments and research institutes reached 214,673, exceeding the plan by 2.3% and increasing by 40,980 over the previous year. Significant progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of various chronic diseases that harm people's health, especially in the fight against schistosomiasis, with over 400,000 patients treated. To inherit and carry forward the medical heritage of our motherland and to give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine, approximately 30,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have been recruited to work in public health institutions. In addition, various aspects such as health and epidemic prevention, medical prevention, and maternal and child health have also done a lot of work.

With the development of economic and cultural construction, by the end of 1956, the total number of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, state organs, people's organizations, and cultural, educational, scientific, and health departments included in the national plan (hereinafter referred to as the total number of workers and staff included in the national plan) reached 22.4 million; the annual average number (the cumulative number of actual people per day throughout the year divided by 365 days, which gives the annual average number) was 21.179 million, an increase of 5.357 million over the previous year. Excluding the 3.05 million people transferred from private industrial and commercial enterprises to state-owned and joint state-private enterprises and township cadres, the actual increase over the previous year was more than 2.3 million. This is the year with the highest increase in employment in recent years. If the workers and staff included in the national plan and those not included in the national plan are calculated together, then by the end of 1956, it would be 24.17 million, which is 1.77 million more than the 22.4 million included in the plan.

In 1956, the total wages of workers and staff included in the national plan increased by approximately 2.7 billion yuan over the previous year, and the annual average wage (the total wage of all workers and staff throughout the year divided by the annual average number, which gives the annual average wage) increased by nearly 14%. Farmers' income also increased. According to surveys in many areas, in areas that were not affected by disasters or were slightly affected, approximately 80% of agricultural production cooperatives increased production, and approximately 75% of households increased income. Although the disaster-stricken areas had reduced production or very little harvest, through the organization of production self-rescue by agricultural production cooperatives and the strong support of the government, except for a few areas with poor work, the living conditions of farmers in disaster-stricken areas have generally been guaranteed.

In 1956, the national purchasing power reached approximately 465 billion yuan, an increase of 15.6% over the previous year, which is a concrete manifestation of the improvement of people's material living standards based on economic development.

In summary, our work in 1956 achieved tremendous victories and achievements. This is the result of the unity and joint efforts of the entire nation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, including workers, peasants, intellectuals, various nationalities, various democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, and other patriotic people. The great victory of the socialist transformation cause and the great development of the economic construction cause in 1956 have laid a solid foundation for the overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in our country.

There is no doubt that the great victories and achievements of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country will have a profound and extremely favorable impact on the future development of our national economy; however, they also bring some difficulties. The occurrence of these difficulties is partly due to objective reasons, and partly due to the shortcomings and errors in our work.

Now, it seems that the following points are the main shortcomings and errors in the work of 1956 that should be emphasized:

First, in 1956, the state's investment in basic construction was approximately 15 to 20 billion yuan more than necessary. Due to the excessive investment in basic construction, the following situation arose: the growth rate of basic construction investment exceeded the growth rate of the production of means of production, especially the growth rate of the production of building materials and certain mechanical equipment, thus causing a tense supply situation for steel, wood, and certain mechanical equipment. It should be said that this is an error in the planning work of 1956, but at that time we did not fully understand it, and it was only later that we realized it. Because the basic construction plan has always had about 5% that could not be completed in previous years, when formulating the 1956 basic construction plan, we also thought that a similar situation would occur. However, the execution result of the 1956 basic construction plan was completed at 99.9%, thus more clearly showing that the basic construction investment in 1956 was set too high.

Second, in 1956, the bank credit plan increased agricultural loans by 11.2 billion yuan and loans for handicrafts and joint state-private enterprises by 2.9 billion yuan. However, the execution result increased agricultural loans by 20.3 billion yuan and loans for handicrafts and joint state-private enterprises by 9.4 billion yuan. The two items totaled 29.7 billion yuan, exceeding the plan by 15.6 billion yuan. To ensure the great victory of the socialist revolution from a financial perspective, it was completely necessary to increase these loans. The original plans for these loans were obviously too low. The increase in the amount of these loans during execution was mostly correct. However, if used more frugally, a few billion yuan could have been saved. During execution, there was a small part that should have been less loaned but was not, which is a shortcoming in our work.

Third, in 1956, the plan increased the number of workers and staff by 840,000, but the execution result increased by 2.3 million, exceeding the plan by 1.46 million. Due to the development of the economy and the expansion of various undertakings exceeding the original plan, it was necessary to slightly exceed the original plan in the execution of the labor plan, but it was obviously too much. This is the result of our lack of control and some departments easily recruiting staff. In addition, in 1956, the wages of workers and staff were increased, which is basically correct, but some people's wages were increased too much.

Fourth, in 1956, the enrollment targets for the educational sector were set too high in some cases, and during execution, some aspects exceeded the original targets, resulting in some schools having enrollment numbers that exceeded the possible conditions of teacher resources, school buildings, and equipment supply, bringing some difficulties to teachers and students in teaching and living.

Due to the above shortcomings and errors, our country's fiscal revenue and expenditure appeared with a deficit; in bank credit revenue and expenditure, there was also a gap, and a part of the currency was issued. These two aspects are concentrated in the excessive use of the commercial reserves and material reserves accumulated by the state over the past few years. This has brought some difficulties and unfavorable influences to the arrangement of economic work and cultural work in 1957.

It should be said that to ensure the great victory of the socialist revolution, to ensure the overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, and to smoothly overcome the great famine in 1956, it is completely appropriate to appropriately use the state's reserve strength. Not using it is incorrect. Doing so, although it brings some difficulties to our future work, these difficulties are only temporary and partial and can be gradually overcome in future work. We should also understand that historically, any major revolution usually causes great fluctuations in social and economic life. For the victory of the democratic revolution, we have endured countless sacrifices and difficulties, and today, in the struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution, and at the same time achieving the victory of great construction and overcoming a great famine, only such a small fluctuation and difficulty have occurred, can we say that our situation is bad? We should say that the overall situation is very good. Due to the superiority of China's planned economy, we can consciously adjust the fluctuations in social and economic life caused by the great revolution in the 1957 plan and subsequent plans. Our prices are basically stable, and some state reserves can be partially replenished in 1957, and people's lives can still be improved. This means that the victory of the socialist revolution achieved by the Chinese people from 1955 to 1956 is truly a peaceful revolution. We have avoided to the greatest extent possible the destruction and losses that may be caused by the revolution, which is extremely beneficial to the people of the entire country.

II. Explanation of the Draft of the 1957 National Economic Plan

Based on the development of the national economy in 1956, we have formulated the draft of the 1957 national economic plan. As mentioned earlier, the socialist transformation of our country in 1956 has achieved great victories, and the socialist construction cause is progressing rapidly. The main indicators of the First Five-Year Plan have either been completed ahead of schedule or are close to completion. These are the favorable conditions for arranging the 1957 national economic plan. However, in 1956, our country suffered the most severe famine since liberation, which has an unfavorable impact on various aspects of the national economy in 1957; due to the shortcomings and errors in the work of 1956 mentioned earlier, some aspects of economic work and cultural work have emerged with some contradictions that urgently need to be resolved. These are the difficult conditions for arranging the 1957 national economic plan. Based on the above favorable and difficult conditions, under the policy of comprehensive consideration, proper arrangement, looking ahead and behind, overall balance, increasing production and saving, frugal construction of the country, carrying forward achievements, and correcting shortcomings, we have formulated the draft of the 1957 national economic plan.

Everyone knows that the formulation of an annual plan must ensure that it can mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, have sufficient and reliable material and financial guarantees, and reserve necessary reserves. The arrangement of the 1957 national economic plan is to make the growth of basic construction as far as possible to match the growth of the production of means of production; to make the growth of social purchasing power match the growth of the production of consumer goods; to make the development of culture, education, science, and the arrangement of labor wages match the development of various sectors of the national economy; to make various sectors of the national economy develop relatively balancedly between the upper and lower years. When arranging the relationship between consumption and accumulation, first ensure necessary consumption; when arranging production and the materials needed for basic construction, first ensure the necessary needs of production; when arranging basic construction, pay as much attention as possible to the appropriate proportion of investment in various sectors and the economic effect of investment, strive to use the same amount of money to do more things.

The draft of the 1957 national economic plan has been printed into a separate volume and distributed to the delegates. The detailed figures are not repeated here. Now, I will only explain some of the main issues in the plans for industrial production, agricultural production, basic construction, transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, scientific research, and labor wages.

(1) Industrial Production

The total industrial output value for 1957 is planned to be 603.4 billion yuan, an increase of 4.5% over the previous year (this is based on the total industrial output value of enterprises included in the national plan in 1956 being 577.2 billion yuan). The industrial total output value in 1956 increased by 31% over the previous year. Why is the planned growth rate of industrial production in 1957 so much lower than that of the previous year?

Here, in addition to the fact that new-style animal-drawn agricultural tools, steam engines, water wheels, and other agricultural machinery were produced in excess in 1956 and the plan for 1957 basically stops their production, and some other products in the machinery manufacturing industry will have a corresponding decrease in output value due to the decrease in basic construction investment in 1957, the main reason is that the planned production of consumer goods in 1957 has increased very little compared to 1956. The proportion of consumer goods production in the total industrial output value of our country is 50.3% in 1956 and is planned to be 48.4% in 1957; and in consumer goods production, the proportion of textile and food industry output value is the largest, which is 77.7% in 1956 and is planned to be 77% in 1957. Due to the planned reduction of 611,000 pieces of cotton yarn in 1957, the output value of the textile industry will decrease by 14.4 billion yuan, and this item alone will reduce the growth rate of the total industrial output value by approximately 2.5%. The planned total output value of the food industry in 1957 is only 2.2 billion yuan more than that in 1956, and the increase is also very small. The industrial production plan for 1957, due to the decrease in textile industry production and the very small increase in food industry production, not only makes the overall consumer goods production plan grow by only 1.1% over the previous year but also pulls down the growth rate of the entire industrial production plan for 1957.

However, if we look at the planned growth rates of the production of means of production and consumer goods separately, the situation is different. The planned production of means of production in 1957 is 311.3 billion yuan, an increase of 8% over the previous year; the planned production of consumer goods is 292.1 billion yuan, an increase of 1.1% over the previous year.

The planned production and growth rates of the main products of means of production in 1957 are as follows:

Electricity: 18.86 billion kWh, an increase of 13.7% over the previous year.

Raw coal: 117.27 million tons, an increase of 10.7% over the previous year.

Crude oil: 1.5 million tons, an increase of 29% over the previous year.

Pig iron: 5.554 million tons, an increase of 16.3% over the previous year.

Steel: 4.987 million tons, an increase of 11.7% over the previous year.

Steel products: 4.478 million tons, an increase of 17% over the previous year.

Caustic soda: 178,000 tons, an increase of 13.8% over the previous year.

Ammonium sulfate: 499,000 tons, an increase of 11.8% over the previous year.

Cement: 6.807 million tons, an increase of 6.5% over the previous year.

Steam boilers: 4,019.7 tons of evaporation, an increase of 33% over the previous year.

Steam turbines: 143,500 kW, an increase of 19.1% over the previous year.

Generators: 284,000 kW, 98.9% of the previous year.

Electric motors: 1.251 million kW, an increase of 17.7% over the previous year.

Transformers: 3.598 million kVA, an increase of 26.4% over the previous year.

Metal-cutting machine tools: 22,640 units, an increase of 2.7% over the previous year.

Heavy-duty trucks: 7,000 units, an increase of 324.8% over the previous year.

Logs: 25.06 million cubic meters (including handicraft production), an increase of 21.9% over the previous year.

From the planned production growth of the main products of means of production listed above, it can be seen that the output of most products in 1957 has increased by more than 10% over the previous year, and more than half of the products have increased by more than 15% over the previous year. Maintaining such a development speed on the basis of a 41.7% increase in the production of means of production in 1956 should be considered not slow. This shows that when we arranged the industrial production plan for 1957, we continued to adhere to the principle of prioritizing the development of the production of means of production, which is undoubtedly beneficial to the development of our country's socialist construction cause.

As mentioned earlier, the 1957 plan basically stops the production of new-style animal-drawn agricultural tools, steam engines, water wheels, and other agricultural machinery, and the planned investment in basic construction in 1957 is reduced compared to 1956, which limits the growth rate of the machinery manufacturing industry. The planned output value of the machinery manufacturing industry in 1957 is 54.9 billion yuan, which is 95.6% of the previous year. The production of the machinery manufacturing industry in 1956 increased by 90.2% over the previous year. This also inevitably affects the growth rate of the production of means of production in 1957. If the output value of the machinery manufacturing industry is excluded from the total output value of the production of means of production for comparison, then the growth rate of the planned production of means of production in 1957 is not 8%, but more than 11%.

The planned production and growth rates of the main products of consumer goods in 1957 are as follows:

Cotton yarn: 4.635 million pieces, which is 88.3% of the previous year.

Cotton cloth: 5 billion meters (including handicraft production), which is 85.3% of the previous year.

Sackcloth: 78.14 million pieces, which is 99.3% of the previous year.

Flour: 5.03 million tons (including handicraft production), an increase of 0.2% over the previous year.

Sugar: 874,000 tons (including handicraft production), an increase of 8.3% over the previous year.

Why is the production of some products in the planned consumer goods industry in 1957 increased very little, and some products are even reduced compared to the previous year? This is mainly due to the fact that agriculture suffered disasters in the previous year, and the production of major industrial raw material crops did not complete the plan. In 1956, due to the bumper harvest of cotton in the previous year and the relatively large amount of imported cotton, the production of cotton yarn increased by 32.2% over the previous year. However, such a high growth rate is difficult to sustain. Because the bumper harvest or poor harvest of agriculture in our country is greatly influenced by natural conditions. Consecutive years of bumper harvests are rare, and after a bumper year, it is often a normal year or a poor year. Since the liberation of the entire country, our country's agriculture has had three bumper years (1950, 1952, 1955), two normal years (1951, 1953), and three poor years (1949, 1954, 1956). In the past few years, the bumper harvest or poor harvest of agriculture has repeatedly affected the fluctuations in the growth rate of the production of light industry in our country. The fluctuations in agricultural bumper harvests and poor harvests will affect the fluctuations in the national economy, which is difficult to avoid under the current conditions of our country; however, drastic fluctuations are very unfavorable for the development of the national economy. Therefore, for grain, cotton, and other parts of industrial raw material crops, necessary reserves should be made under possible conditions to balance production and consumption in poor years, reducing the fluctuations in social and economic life. In the future, when we formulate plans, we should fully pay attention to this point.

In the production of handicrafts, the main problem is the relatively tense supply of raw materials. We have given appropriate consideration to the needs of handicraft production when distributing raw materials. For example: the total production level of cotton cloth in 1957 is planned to decrease by about 15% compared to the previous year, but the production of hand-woven textiles is planned to maintain about 90% of the production level of the previous year; in the supply of steel and iron materials, in addition to the iron produced by handicrafts for their own use, the scrap steel and iron recovered by various places are first used to meet the needs of handicraft production, and the state also allocates a part from the unified distribution of steel and iron materials to handicrafts. After taking these measures, the total output value of handicraft production in 1957 is estimated to be able to maintain the level of 1956 or be slightly higher.

To ensure the smooth progress of handicraft production, the handicraft management departments and handicraft production cooperatives should continue to adjust the production organization, strengthen the rectification of cooperative affairs, and launch production and saving campaigns. Within the handicraft production cooperatives, there is currently a tendency to blindly pursue semi-mechanization and mechanization, and to transform handicraft production cooperatives into state-owned factories, which should be corrected. At the same time, individual handicraft workers should be assisted and not excluded.

(2) Agricultural Production

The planned total agricultural and sideline output value for 1957 is 611.5 billion yuan, an increase of 4.9% over the previous year.

The planned total grain production (excluding soybeans) is 38.2 billion jin, an increase of 1.7 billion jin over the previous year, a growth of 4.7%.

The planned total cotton production is 30 million dan, an increase of 1.1 million dan over the previous year, a growth of 3.8%.

Currently, the development of agriculture in our country lags far behind the requirements of people's lives and the requirements of the development of light industry. Therefore, we must continue to implement the "Outline for the Development of Agriculture in China (Draft)" and implement the policies of frugal management of cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives, gradually resolving the contradictions between the state and cooperatives, between cooperatives, and within cooperatives, and doing everything possible to promote the increase in grain and other crop production. The state has always adopted a policy of active support for the development of agriculture. To ensure the continuous improvement of the unit yield of crops, in the future, we will pay special attention to the development of the chemical fertilizer industry to increase the supply of fertilizers. Reclamation of wasteland requires a lot of investment, but to increase agricultural production, based on the possible financial and material conditions of the state, it is necessary to increase some investment to expand the cultivated land area.

As mentioned earlier, the increase in cotton and other industrial raw material crops has a significant impact on the growth of industrial production. Currently, our country's light industry has a relatively large production capacity, with 7 million spindles for cotton yarn, which can spin more than 56 million pieces of yarn per year, and some other light industry enterprises also have surplus production capacity. People will ask, why can't we produce more industrial raw material crops to fully utilize the production capacity of light industry enterprises? The main reason is that the population of our country is increasing rapidly, and the increase in cultivated land area is limited. The increase in grain still cannot meet the growing needs of people's consumption, and it is not possible to increase the planting area of industrial raw material crops in the existing cultivated land. In recent years, due to the gradual expansion of the planting area of industrial raw material crops, although the planting area of grain crops has also increased, its proportion in the planting area of various crops has been gradually decreasing. The planned planting area of various crops in 1957 is 239.989 million mu, an increase of 11.1% over 1953, of which the planting area of industrial raw material crops is 23.071 million mu, an increase of 31.9% over 1953; the planting area of grain crops is 184.972 million mu, an increase of 7.9% over 1953. The proportion of grain crops in the planting area of various crops was 79.3% in 1953 and decreased to 77.1% in 1957. To ensure the grain supply for the entire population and to ensure the raw materials needed by industry, it is necessary to properly arrange the proportion of the planting area of grain crops and industrial raw material crops. Before our country can greatly open up wasteland and greatly expand the cultivated land area, it is wrong to inappropriately expand the planting area of industrial raw material crops in the existing cultivated land, but it is also unfavorable to reduce the existing planting area of industrial raw material crops. Cotton, sugar, and oil crops, which are the main industrial raw material crops, should maintain the planting area of 1957 and not be reduced, but should be slightly increased, and effective measures such as fine farming and the use of superior varieties should be further strengthened to improve the unit yield.

The increase in pig production is also a matter of great concern to everyone, because it not only relates to the supply of meat in cities and rural areas but also pig farming is an important source of fertilizer for current agriculture. To ease the tension in the supply of meat in cities and rural areas and to meet the needs of agricultural increase for fertilizer, it is necessary to improve the quantity and quality of pig production. The planned number of pigs at the end of the year in 1957 is 1.1 billion, an increase of 122 million over the previous year. Is there a guarantee to complete this plan? Due to the high attention of various levels of leadership to the development of the pig industry, the national average purchase price of live pigs has increased by 14.26%, making it more beneficial for farmers to raise pigs; the sources of feed have increased, and the state has reserved more concentrated feed for farmers than in the previous year; in addition, appropriately increasing farmers' private plots to help farmers solve the problem of vegetables and animal feed. These are the favorable conditions for completing the plan. On the other hand, the planned number of pigs in 1957 is more than 10 million higher than the highest production year of 1954, and the quality of pigs in many places is still not high at present, so it is necessary to make great efforts to complete the plan and improve the quality of pigs. However, due to the measures taken above, the number of pigs purchased by the commercial department has begun to increase, and the quality of some pigs is better than that of the previous year, indicating that farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs has been improved, and it is possible to complete the plan.

The planned afforestation area in 1957 is 45 million mu, a decrease of 5 million mu compared to the previous year. Why is the planned afforestation area in 1957 less than that of the previous year? This is because from 1953 to 1956, the average annual afforestation was 27.445 million mu, which is not small, but the survival rate is relatively low. According to typical surveys, the survival rate of past afforestation is generally around 60%. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the survival rate can be significantly improved before striving to complete this year's afforestation task. In the logging of timber, local forest areas have generally logged less in remote and mountainous areas and more in areas with convenient transportation, which is not conducive to water and soil conservation and the renewal of forest areas. This year, the investment in local timber logging has been increased, mainly used for road construction, to increase the logging volume in deep mountains, and gradually change the logging situation that is not conducive to water and soil conservation and the renewal of forest areas.

(3) Basic Construction

The planned investment in basic construction for 1957 is 111 billion yuan, which is 79.4% of the previous year. The determination of the basic construction investment for 1957 has been repeatedly balanced in terms of material supply and finance. After comparing and studying various plans, we adopted the plan of 111 billion yuan. Because this plan can not only make the basic construction in 1957 maintain an appropriate scale, ensure the overfulfillment of the construction tasks in the First Five-Year Plan, but also is conducive to the arrangement of the 1958 plan; it can not only ease the tense supply situation of some raw materials and some mechanical equipment caused in 1956, which is conducive to the development of production, but also can minimize the loss of idle construction forces and equipment accumulation. The basic construction investment of 111 billion yuan compared to the basic construction investment of 1956 is less. However, compared to the original investment of 1957 specified in the Five-Year Plan, it still exceeds by 14 billion yuan; if the realized investment of the previous four years and the planned investment of 1957 are calculated together, it exceeds the total investment of the Five-Year Plan specified in the Five-Year Plan by 49.78 billion yuan.

Based on the above basic construction investment, in terms of project arrangement, the investment proportion of several departments has been appropriately adjusted, and the weak links have been strengthened. The main points are: reducing the investment proportion of non-production construction and increasing the investment proportion of production construction. Reducing the investment proportion of departments such as the textile industry, food industry, and machinery manufacturing industry, which have temporarily surplus equipment capacity, and increasing the investment proportion of departments such as coal, electricity, metallurgy, chemistry, and forestry, which have insufficient production capacity. Maintaining the investment proportion of the agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments. Increasing the investment proportion of local investment and correspondingly reducing the investment proportion of central departments. For example, the proportion of non-production construction investment in the total investment has decreased from 22.4% in 1956 to about 20% in 1957. Again, for example, the five industrial departments of coal, electricity, metallurgy, chemistry, and forestry had a total investment of 34.5 billion yuan in 1956, accounting for 50% of the total investment of various industrial departments; the planned investment in 1957 is 37.1 billion yuan, accounting for 59.1% of the planned investment of various industrial departments. Again, for example, the investment ratio of raw materials, fuel, and electricity industries to metal processing and machinery manufacturing industries has changed from the 1.9:1 ratio specified in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 to the 3.3:1 ratio in the 1957 plan. The proportion of local investment in the total national investment has increased from 13.7% specified in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 to 18.8% in the 1957 plan.

Title: 1957 National Economic Plan
Author:
Date: 1957-02-28
Page: 1

When drafting the 1957 national economic plan, we also recognized that in the production of means of production, the development of our raw materials, fuel, and power industries lagged behind the requirements of other industrial sectors. The development of the metallurgical industry lagged behind the requirements of the metal processing and machinery manufacturing industries. In actively developing our raw materials, fuel, and power industries, in addition to continuing to build several key large-scale enterprises, we should also pay special attention to developing more small and medium-sized enterprises with low investment and quick returns, and to developing small coal mines, small iron mines, small non-ferrous metal mines, and non-metallic mines in a planned manner to increase the production of raw materials and fuel. In the metal processing and machinery manufacturing industries, in addition to developing some heavy and precision machinery manufacturing enterprises, we should, under the premise of combining peacetime and wartime, specialization and cooperation, and manufacturing and repair, coordinate the enterprises managed by various machinery industry departments, non-machinery industry sectors, and local machinery industry enterprises to fully tap the potential of our metal processing and machinery manufacturing industries. These tasks have already begun to be addressed in the 1957 plan, and we must further solve these problems in the future.

According to the above investment arrangements, the number of construction projects for industrial enterprises above the designated scale planned to start in 1957 is 591, of which 219 are planned to be completed. The number of construction projects for industrial enterprises above the designated scale planned to start by various industrial departments in 1957 is 486, of which 177 are planned to be completed. Among the projects planned to be completed, the main ones are: coal mines 58, power stations 21, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy 14, building materials and wood processing 9, metal processing and machinery manufacturing 32, textiles, papermaking, food, and other light industries 20. After these enterprises are put into production and reach their design capacity, the annual production volume is: raw coal 10.8 million tons, electricity 3.36 billion kWh (installed capacity 673,000 kW), crude oil 325,000 tons, pig iron 810,000 tons, steel 489,000 tons, coke 1.57 million tons, sulfuric acid 40,000 tons, ammonium nitrate 90,000 tons, cement 1.08 million tons, timber exported 3.15 million cubic meters, cotton yarn 693,000 pieces (spindles 715,000), cotton cloth 64.602 million meters (looms 21,325), machine-made paper 136,000 tons, machine-made sugar 87,000 tons, etc. However, practice has shown that after new enterprises are put into production, after a certain period, their annual output often exceeds the design capacity.

In terms of agricultural infrastructure, the investment plan for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments and local agriculture in 1957 is 9.7 billion yuan, a decrease of 1.9 billion yuan from the previous year. This is mainly due to the reduction of investment in secondary technical schools and research institutions, and the reduction in the number of tractors added. The Ministry of Water Resources plans to start construction on 26 projects above the designated scale in 1957, including 10 reservoir projects, and the formal commencement of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yellow River. There are 32 local water conservancy projects above the designated scale. The State Farm Administration plans to build 3 state farms above the designated scale; there are 93 local state farms above the designated scale. The investment in infrastructure in 1957 has been reduced in both agriculture and industry, but to meet the needs of agricultural development, we have already taken into account making agriculture reduce a little less and industry reduce a little more when allocating the investment.

In 1957, the railway plans to lay 1,860 kilometers of track, including: new construction 535 kilometers, restoration 152 kilometers, new double-track 533 kilometers, dedicated lines 640 kilometers. In the new railway track construction: 329 kilometers of the Baotou-Lanzhou line, 63 kilometers of the Nanping-Liancheng line in Fujian, and 45 kilometers of the Yakeshi Forestry line in Inner Mongolia. The Ministry of Communications plans to construct 7 highways in 1957, with the main ones being the new construction of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway and the reconstruction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway; the planned increase in new highway mileage is 1,125 kilometers. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications plans to build 12 long-distance carrier telephone lines for the Jinghan, Jinghu, Jingshen, Jingxi (Xian), and Xian-Lanzhou routes, and improve provincial lines in 1957.

The commercial departments plan to start construction on 17 projects above the designated scale in 1957, mainly meat processing plants and cold storage, with a planned increase in daily slaughter capacity of 11,000 pigs and a cold storage capacity of 515,000 tons.

The cultural and educational departments plan to start construction on 37 projects above the designated scale in 1957, mainly including: 11 higher education institutions (directly managed by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education), 7 film studios and printing houses, 4 hospitals; it is planned to build and expand higher education institutions to accommodate 33,000 new students, and to build new hospitals to add 1,420 beds.

In the arrangement of basic construction investment in 1957, in accordance with the policy of frugal construction, while ensuring the quality of the projects, we have modified some overly high and inappropriate design standards, as much as possible to consider the professional division of labor and cooperation among various departments and factories, reduced non-production construction investment, cut non-urgent projects and reduced the scale of some enterprises, and as much as possible to use local materials to reduce construction costs. After taking these measures, funds have been saved and the economic effectiveness of the investment has been improved. To further implement the policy of frugal construction, it is necessary to make necessary modifications to the original designs and plans, which is a complex and detailed task. If done well, it can save a lot of money, but if done poorly, it may cause new waste. Therefore, we must save every possible investment and at the same time oppose shoddy work, using various methods to improve the quality of the projects. Recently, a national design work conference was held, and the comprehensive review and modification of various original designs and plans have begun. We believe that with the active efforts of all the workers in the country, all the surveying, design, and construction engineering technical personnel, we will be able to further implement the policy of frugal construction, save a large amount of funds for the state, and do a better job in construction.

(Four) Transportation
The 1957 transportation plan is arranged to adapt to the development of industry and agriculture and the scale of basic construction.

In terms of railway transportation, the cargo volume is planned to be 256 million tons, an increase of 4% from the previous year; the cargo turnover volume is planned to be 12.65 billion ton-kilometers, an increase of 5.1% from the previous year.

The railways newly built from 1953 to 1956 have connected the mutual relations between the northwestern, southwestern, central, and coastal regions of our country, which has played a significant role in the development of our national economy. However, with the development of production and construction, and the increase in the number of new lines and cargo volume, the burden on the old lines has greatly increased, to the extent that some sections such as the Jinghan, Shitai, Tongpu, and western section of the Luohan lines have experienced serious capacity shortages in 1956, leading to congestion. To change this situation, in 1957, we appropriately increased the investment in strengthening old lines. The proportion of investment in strengthening old lines in the total investment of the Ministry of Railways increased from 26.4% in 1956 to 39.4% in 1957, with a plan to build 533 kilometers of double tracks in some sections of the Jinghan, Shitai, and Luohan lines. After taking these measures and strengthening the organization of transportation, it is estimated that the railway transportation capacity will increase.

In terms of waterway transportation, the carrying capacity of the Yangtze River has increased by 230,620 tons of ships in the past four years, and 32,600 tons of ships are planned to be added in 1957. The total increase over five years exceeds the original plan by 2,520 tons. This is very important for ensuring the export of grain and other agricultural products from Sichuan Province and the import of industrial products to the southwestern provinces. From the second half of 1956 to the first half of 1957, more than 400 million jin of grain has already been transported by water to support disaster-stricken and grain-deficient areas. However, the transportation situation on the Yangtze River, especially on the Jianjiang, is still very tense. This is due to the fact that the construction of ports lags behind the increase in ship transportation capacity; the increase in transportation capacity in the middle and lower reaches has not matched the increase in the upper reaches. Therefore, in 1957, it is planned to strengthen the construction of ports such as Chongqing and Hankou, and to build tugboats to increase the transportation capacity in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In transportation management, attention has already been paid to strengthening port management, and to coordinating the cooperation between ports, navigation, and ship repair work.

The southwestern provinces are densely populated and rich in resources, and they have many agricultural and sideline products that can support the whole country. At the same time, industrial products from all over the country must also support the southwestern provinces. The biggest difficulty at present is the lack of transportation capacity. Although the number of ships on the Yangtze River has increased and the Baocheng Railway has been built, it is still not enough to meet the needs of economic development. Therefore, in addition to continuing to strengthen waterway transportation, we must also start preparing for the construction of new railway trunk lines.

Due to the backwardness of our country's oil production and the shortage of liquid fuel, it will not be possible to develop automobile transportation on a large scale in the near future. To meet the needs of the development of industry and agriculture and construction, while fully utilizing the transportation capacity of modern transportation tools such as railways and waterways, we should pay attention to the role of various folk transportation tools. At present, various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government are organizing and utilizing various folk transportation tools according to local conditions, which has played a very good role, and this work should be further strengthened in the future.

To ensure the completion of the 1957 transportation plan, all transportation departments must strengthen the organization and leadership of transportation, improve the utilization efficiency of transportation equipment. Between various transportation departments, the joint transportation system should be promoted, transportation cooperation contracts should be signed, and the cooperation and coordination of transportation should be done well. Various production, sales departments, and transportation departments should vigorously implement the rational transportation and unified delivery system, and pay attention to the balance of transportation.

(Five) Commerce
The estimated social purchasing power for 1957 is approximately 47.32 billion yuan, an increase of 8.2 billion yuan from the previous year, a growth of 1.8%. This social purchasing power plan, on the one hand, estimates the possible increase in purchasing power of farmers in the case of normal agricultural production and the increase in the total wage of workers, with the two items totaling an increase of approximately 18 billion yuan in the purchasing power of residents compared to the previous year; on the other hand, due to the reduction in the purchasing power of social groups such as government agencies, the military, enterprises, and people's organizations, the plan is reduced by 9.8 billion yuan compared to the previous year. Thus, the increase and decrease offset each other, and the social purchasing power plan for 1957 is increased by 8.2 billion yuan compared to the previous year.

In terms of commodity supply, the estimated total commodity supply for 1957 is approximately 46.35 billion yuan. Although there is a difference between commodity supply and social purchasing power, by seriously carrying out the production increase and cost reduction movement, opening up sources of raw materials to increase the production of consumer goods, planning the import of a portion of commodities, and strengthening commodity supply work, combined with the adjustment of prices for some commodities in the spring of this year, it is possible to make social purchasing power and commodity supply approach balance, and market prices can continue to remain stable.

After the severe natural disasters in 1956, the state transferred 5.08 billion jin of grain from the surplus areas in the southwest to support the disaster-stricken and grain-deficient areas, with Hubei Province alone receiving 3.63 billion jin, ensuring that the broad masses of disaster-stricken areas were free from hunger and that the grain supply in grain-deficient areas was guaranteed, and at the same time preventing the rise in grain prices. Due to the reduction in cotton production caused by disasters, the planned production of cotton yarn in 1957 is reduced by approximately 611,000 pieces compared to the previous year, resulting in a reduction of approximately 23 million meters in the sales volume of cotton cloth compared to the previous year, and it is necessary to use the second batch of cloth tickets from May to August this year at half price. In this way, although the supply of cotton cloth is reduced, the rise in cotton cloth prices is also avoided. While the state is making great efforts to stabilize the prices of major commodities such as grain and cotton cloth, it has also taken the initiative to raise the prices of some commodities as a method to balance social purchasing power. From an overall perspective, we believe that this measure is reasonable and necessary.

Here, let me briefly discuss the arrangement of the foreign trade plan for 1957.

The planned total import and export trade volume for 1957 is approximately 91.6% of the total import and export trade volume for 1956. In terms of the export plan, the main reduction is in the export volume of grain, edible oil, and pork to meet domestic needs. For example, the planned export of grain (including soybeans) in 1957 is 3.8 billion jin, a reduction of 1.08 billion jin from the previous year; the planned export of pork (including live pigs) is 77,000 tons, a reduction of 85,000 tons from the previous year. In terms of the import plan, the main reduction is in the import volume of general machinery and transportation machinery to promote the development of China's machinery manufacturing industry.

In the past few years, China's foreign trade has had approximately 75% of agricultural products and processed agricultural products in the total export volume, and approximately 25% of mineral products and machinery. In the total import volume, machinery and various equipment account for approximately 60%, ferrous and non-ferrous metals account for approximately 10%, and other industrial and agricultural production materials and consumer goods account for approximately 30%. The proportion of various products in exports and imports will gradually change with the development of China's industry and the improvement of people's living standards. In the total export volume, the proportion of agricultural products and processed agricultural products will gradually decrease year by year; the proportion of mineral products and other industrial products will gradually increase year by year. In the total import volume, the proportion of machinery and equipment will gradually decrease year by year; the proportion of certain raw materials needed for industrial and agricultural production and certain consumer goods needed for people's lives will gradually increase year by year. This change has already begun to appear in the arrangement of the 1957 foreign trade plan. Of course, to meet the requirements of China's socialist industrialization, this change can only be gradual.

(Six) Culture, Education, Health, and Scientific Research
In terms of education, due to the excessive enrollment in schools in 1956, the shortage of teachers and school buildings, and teaching equipment could not keep up with the needs of development. In 1957, according to the possible conditions of teachers and financial and material resources, the planned enrollment of various levels of schools was appropriately reduced, so that schools could have more energy to carry out rectification and improve teaching quality.

The planned enrollment and the number of students at the beginning of the school year (hereinafter referred to as the number of students in school) for various levels of schools in 1957 are as follows:

Primary and secondary schools plan to enroll 16.169 million students, with 65.814 million students in school, an increase of 3.7% from the previous year.

Junior and senior middle schools plan to enroll 1.843 million students, with 5.566 million students in school, an increase of 7.8% from the previous year.

Secondary specialized schools (including secondary technical schools and secondary normal schools) plan to enroll 158,000 students, with 775,000 students in school, equivalent to the level of the previous year.

Higher education institutions plan to enroll 107,000 students, with 443,000 students in school, an increase of 10% from the previous year.

The planned enrollment for various levels of schools in 1957, although reduced from the previous year, still has a significant increase in the number of students at the beginning of the school year. In solving the problems caused by the excessive enrollment in the previous year and the increase in the number of students in school this year, there are still many difficulties. The education department and various levels of schools should strive to overcome these difficulties. People from all walks of life should also help the education department overcome difficulties.

It should be pointed out that education can only develop gradually on the basis of production development. The main purpose of China's general education is to cultivate loyal cadres for the socialist cause with a certain level of culture and healthy bodies, and only then to lay a foundation of general knowledge for the cultivation of specialized talents. From now on, we should emphasize and gradually implement the system of combining mental and manual labor. On the one hand, we should encourage mental workers to participate in some possible manual labor; at the same time, we should mobilize young intellectuals working in government agencies to leave their jobs and work in rural areas and factories for a few years to learn and master production knowledge and to familiarize themselves with the lives, feelings, and thoughts of workers and peasants. On the other hand, we should strengthen the part-time education of the working people, gradually improve the cultural level of manual laborers; at the same time, we should regularly select people with a certain level of culture and work ability who have close ties with the masses from among workers and peasants to work in government agencies to strengthen the regular contact between government agency workers and workers and peasants. At present, there are still many school-age children who cannot attend school, which is unavoidable. School-age children who cannot attend school can only delay their enrollment. Most of the graduates of primary and secondary schools cannot proceed to the next level of education and should engage in manual labor, which is a normal and reasonable phenomenon. Graduates of middle and primary schools who have reached working age should be persuaded and supported to return to rural areas to participate in production if they are from rural areas; if they are from urban areas and cannot be arranged in the city, they should be mobilized and arranged to work in rural areas in agriculture as much as possible. This is a policy that must be adopted in the next relatively long period.

In the context of the gradual improvement of people's lives in China, in addition to the reasonable use of state-run schools, the method of mass-run schools should be actively promoted. Government agencies, organizations, and enterprises can collectively run schools (without funding from government agencies or enterprises); farmers and urban residents can also organize collectively run schools; intellectuals can cooperatively run schools; individuals who are enthusiastic about education and have the conditions can also run schools individually. In short, primary and secondary education should be carried out in various ways. The funds allocated by the state for education will gradually increase, and the planned enrollment for middle and primary schools will also gradually increase. However, the state's financial and material resources are limited, so the education funds and enrollment numbers cannot increase much each year. Various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can, according to the local situation, organize various forces within the limit of not increasing the state's allocation, collectively or individually to run primary schools, secondary schools, or other schools, which can enroll more students to study.

This year, secondary specialized schools, in addition to continuing to enroll new students from junior high school graduates in secondary normal schools, secondary technical schools plan to enroll new students from existing enterprise workers.

The number of students in higher education institutions this year is still increasing. We require consolidating the achievements made, overcoming shortcomings, and striving to improve teaching quality.

In terms of health, we continue to implement the policy of prevention first, continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign, and this remains the center of health work in 1957. Rural medical work should further play the role of primary health organizations, organize more outpatient, home visits, and mobile medical services; in cities, attention should be paid to the role of joint clinics and appropriately increase the number of joint clinics, reasonably improve the public medical system, so as to free up more medical resources to meet the medical needs of the general urban population. Whether in rural or urban areas, the role of traditional Chinese medicine should be further played.

In terms of scientific research, the 1957 national scientific research plan draft has been formulated by the Scientific Planning Commission. In the field of natural sciences, China's first research reactor with a power of 7,000 kilowatts and a particle accelerator capable of producing 25 million electron volts is under construction. In 1957, the Chinese Academy of Sciences will start building several important research institutes in key disciplines, such as electronics, computing technology, semiconductors, automation, nuclear physics, mechanics, etc., to lay the foundation for scientific research for future technological development. The scientific research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, various ministries, and local scientific research institutions should be coordinated and divided under the leadership of the Scientific Planning Commission to reasonably use scientific research personnel and equipment, improve the quality of scientific research, and promote the development of scientific research.

In terms of cultural and publishing, local authorities should be given greater autonomy. The various planned indicators for cultural undertakings in 1957 can be adjusted according to the allocated funds and basic construction investment.

In terms of sports, we should continue to promote mass sports activities.

(Seven) Labor and Wages
The total number of workers included in the national plan for 1957 is planned to reach 22.262 million by the end of the year, a decrease of approximately 140,000 from the previous year. The annual average number of workers in 1957 is planned to be 22.168 million, an increase of 4.7% from the previous year.

Why is the total number of workers planned to reach by the end of 1957 less than the actual number at the end of 1956? This is because in the process of implementing the annual plan, there are such shortcomings as the construction and installation departments rushing to complete work in the fourth quarter, and the production and commercial departments rushing to complete tasks in the fourth quarter, resulting in a large increase in workers, but in the first quarter of the next year, there will be a backlog of work. We have initially learned from these lessons, and in 1957, we will try to overcome this shortcoming and appropriately reduce the number of workers. The formation of this shortcoming is inseparable from the lack of strict control over labor plans, the late issuance of annual plans, and the shortcomings in the implementation of the year-end financial settlement system, etc. Therefore, in the future, we should rationally arrange the plans, issue tasks in advance, correct the shortcomings in the implementation of the year-end financial settlement system, so that various economic units can have the opportunity to balance production and balance the completion of plans. At the same time, all enterprises and institutions, except for those approved by higher authorities to rush work or complete tasks for individual special projects or enterprises and institutions, should not rush work or complete tasks in the fourth quarter. In the past, many units used to increase personnel, work overtime, and other improper means to overfulfill tasks, even to seek bonuses, which not only wasted manpower and resources, but also reduced the quality of projects, product quality, and work quality. This practice is wrong and should be corrected.

China has a large population and abundant labor resources. At present, there are excess workers in our factories and mines, while industry can only develop gradually and cannot recruit a large number of workers every year. Therefore, in the future, employment should not only focus on industry, but also more on agriculture, sideline industries, and handicrafts.

The total wage bill for workers included in the national plan for 1957 is planned to be 14.12 billion yuan, an increase of 1.21 billion yuan from the previous year, a growth of 9.4%. Among them: (1) The wages increased in 1956 were issued from April 1st or July 1st, and only two or three quarters were issued, and in 1957, four quarters will be issued, plus some normal promotions, this item will increase by approximately 570 million yuan from the previous year; (2) The workers added in various months in 1956 will all receive full-year wages in 1957, and after the increase and decrease in the number of people are offset, this item will increase by approximately 640 million yuan from the previous year.

The above-mentioned seven aspects of problems are some of the main problems in the 1957 national economic plan.

Comrades! 1957 is the last year of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. After the completion of the 1957 national economic plan, what will be the result of the implementation of China's first Five-Year Plan? Now, it is necessary and welcomed by the people of the whole country to make some predictions about the possible situation of the completion of China's first Five-Year Plan.

The planned total industrial output value for 1957 is 60.34 billion yuan, exceeding the Five-Year Plan by 12.7%. In this way, the growth rate of industrial production during the first Five-Year Plan period will be an average annual increase of 17.4%, which is faster than the originally planned growth rate of 14.7%. The proportion of the production of means of production to the production of consumer goods will change from 39.7:60.3 in 1952 to 51.6:48.4 in 1957. China's steel production will increase from 1.349 million tons in 1952 to 4.987 million tons in 1957, which is 5.4 times the highest annual production before liberation. Due to the continuous investment of new industrial enterprises in production and the continuous growth of technical forces, many new industrial production sectors and new industrial products have emerged. From 1953 to 1956, China has successfully developed and begun mass production of the most important new products: jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, 6,000 kW and 12,000 kW complete thermal power generation equipment, 10,000 kW and 15,000 kW complete hydroelectric power generation equipment, 31,500 kVA transformers, 160-ton steel per day open-hearth furnaces, 4-meter diameter electric hoists, various types of automatic lathes and machine tools, silicon steel sheets, high-quality thin plates, seamless steel pipes, 50-kilogram heavy rails, large structural steel, aluminum materials, high-purity aniline and phenylamine, etc. In 1957, China plans to continue to develop and begin to develop the main new products: 72,500 kW complete hydroelectric power generation equipment, 25,000 kW complete thermal power generation equipment, 40,500 kVA transformers, 2,500-ton hydraulic presses, 700-millimeter complete rolling mills, 80-ton (body weight) electric locomotives, 5,000-ton coastal cargo ships, 4,500-ton coastal oil tankers, 40-horsepower tractors, four-axis automatic lathes, combined machine tools, and indium, selenium, tellurium, germanium, gallium, cobalt rare metal products, etc.

The planned total output value of agriculture and sideline industries for 1957 is 61.15 billion yuan, exceeding the Five-Year Plan by 2.5%. In this way, the growth rate of agricultural and sideline production during the first Five-Year Plan period will be an average annual increase of 4.8%, which will also exceed the originally planned 4.3%. China's grain production will increase from 30.88 billion jin in 1952 to 38.2 billion jin in 1957, while in 1949 it was only 21.62 billion jin. China's cotton production will increase from 2.607 million piculs in 1952 to 3 million piculs in 1957, while in 1949 it was only 888,000 piculs.

The planned basic construction investment for 1957 is 11.1 billion yuan, exceeding the 1957 investment of the Five-Year Plan by 14%, and together with the investment already realized in the previous four years, it is estimated that it can reach 47.722 billion yuan, exceeding the originally planned total investment for five years by 11.6%. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the number of construction projects for industrial enterprises above the designated scale will reach 825, exceeding the originally planned 694 by 131. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the number of completed construction projects for industrial enterprises above the designated scale will reach 448, which is 7 less than the originally planned 455, mainly because some construction projects have expanded in scale and some construction projects have been delayed in progress. The various industrial departments plan to complete 350 construction projects for industrial enterprises above the designated scale in five years, mainly including: coal mines 94, power stations 37, refineries and oil fields 7, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy 20, chemical industry 10, building materials and wood processing 13, metal processing and machinery manufacturing 108, textiles, papermaking, food, and other light industries 45. The planned new production capacity in five years, calculated by the annual production volume, mainly includes: raw coal 45.28 million tons, electricity 10.47 billion kWh (installed capacity 20.94 million kW), natural and synthetic oil 1.265 million tons, pig iron 3.094 million tons, steel 2.17 million tons, steel products 1.149 million tons, cement 2.393 million tons, cotton yarn 1.61 million pieces (spindles 1.66 million), cotton cloth 1.41 billion meters (looms 46,552), machine-made paper 2.15 million tons, machine-made sugar 1.55 million tons. These are all calculated based on design capacity. As mentioned earlier, the actual production capacity of many enterprises will exceed the design capacity.

The planned annual average number of workers included in the national plan for 1957 is 22.168 million, expanding the employment scope of society compared to the Five-Year Plan. The annual average wage of workers is planned to increase by approximately 37% from 1952, exceeding the originally planned increase of 33%. The income of the vast majority of farmers has also increased significantly on the basis of production growth. The planned number of students at the beginning of the school year for higher education institutions, secondary specialized schools, senior and junior high schools, and primary schools exceeds the Five-Year Plan by 2% to 18%.

Therefore, the completion of the 1957 national economic plan, except for some individual construction projects, individual products, and certain undertakings' development indicators, the vast majority of construction projects, the vast majority of products, and the vast majority of undertakings' development indicators can be overfulfilled in China's first Five-Year Plan.

Now, we can confidently say that China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will be completed and overfulfilled. The initial foundation for China's socialist industrialization will be established. China will be able to use its own manufactured equipment to build its own power stations, mining enterprises, medium-sized metallurgical enterprises, metal processing enterprises, chemical industry enterprises, and light industry enterprises. China has begun to use its own manufactured machinery to equip its transportation departments, agricultural departments, and strengthen national defense. China can also use its own produced metal materials to meet most of the needs of the expanding construction industry. The Chinese people know that these achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries to China, and we should once again express our deep gratitude for their assistance.

Three, Strive for the Completion of the 1957 National Economic Plan
To ensure the complete realization of the 1957 national economic plan, it is necessary to implement the policy of frugal construction nationwide and further carry out the production increase and cost reduction movement.

Production increase and cost reduction, frugal construction, is a basic method for the development of the socialist economy and the expansion of socialist accumulation. It is not only a fundamental measure to ensure the realization of the 1957 national economic plan, but also a long-term strategic policy.

Regarding the implementation of the policy of frugal construction and the promotion of the production increase and cost reduction movement in various departments of the national economy and in government agencies, the military, schools, and organizations, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have already issued instructions, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has also issued a call to the nation, which will not be repeated here. I only want to emphasize the issue of how to further implement the policy of frugal construction in various aspects of basic construction. Because the issue of basic construction is the most important issue in China's current economic and political life. And if we can implement the policy of frugal construction well in the construction industry, we can ensure that China can achieve socialist industrialization in three Five-Year Plans or a little more time.

Everyone can see that in the past few years, China's construction industry has achieved tremendous achievements. Many new industrial enterprises have been built, many new industrial cities have emerged, many existing cities have greatly developed their industries, and many consumption cities have begun to transform into production cities. However, it should be pointed out that due to our lack of construction experience and the shortcomings and errors in the work of relevant leadership departments of the state, China's construction industry still has many shortcomings, which have not fully utilized the limited financial and material resources of the state. For example, in industrial construction, more attention has been paid to the arrangement of new and renovated enterprise projects, while less attention has been paid to the reasonable use of China's existing medium and small enterprises and handicrafts. In industrial technology policy, some places have inappropriately emphasized large-scale, modern, and high standards, while less attention has been paid to the construction of medium and small enterprises and the good use of China's abundant labor force. In the supply of industrial equipment, some equipment that can be manufactured domestically is not used, and similar equipment is required to be imported from abroad. In the mutual cooperation of industrial construction, the organization of production cooperation is not emphasized, but the construction of all-round factories is required. The standards for building safety, hygiene, air defense, fire prevention, flood prevention are too high, the city planning is too large, and too many office buildings, guest houses, rest houses, and large auditoriums are built. In these aspects, there is more or less a phenomenon of detachment from reality, detachment from the masses, pursuit of luxury, and waste. All these shortcomings have caused some losses to China's construction industry. We should carefully summarize the experience and lessons, correct these shortcomings, and make the development of China's construction industry more adapt to China's economic backwardness, large population, small land area, large agricultural proportion, and low living standards. For this purpose, we plan to take the following measures step by step:

First, the construction of new industrial enterprises should fully consider the existing production capacity of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts and their mutual relationships, coordinate and arrange appropriately, so as to quickly increase production and promote each other's development; while avoiding mutual exclusion and hindering the development of production.

Second, in industrial construction, we should adopt technical equipment suitable for China's economic conditions and industrial level. In order to achieve industrialization in China, it is necessary to build a number of modern enterprises equipped with the latest technology as the backbone. However, the construction of other enterprises should advocate the combination of the latest technology and general technology, the combination of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and manual operation.

Third, the construction of large enterprises should be combined with the construction of medium and small enterprises, and in the future, more medium and small enterprises should be built.

Fourth, except for the construction of some enterprises that we cannot design ourselves and that have the most advanced technology, which must be designed and equipped by the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, the construction of general medium and small enterprises and enterprises with medium technical level should strive to design and manufacture equipment independently. As long as it can be manufactured domestically, even if the quality is slightly inferior, it should be adopted.

Fifth, with a city or a region as a unit, as far as possible, the cooperation of enterprises should be uniformly arranged, and nearby factories should strive to share auxiliary workshops, attached workshops, and laboratories.

Sixth, reduce construction standards. The standards for production buildings, including workshops, should, under the principle of ensuring the quality of the buildings and ensuring the smooth progress of production, strive for savings, and should not pursue overly high standards. The standards for dormitories, whether in cities or rural areas, should generally be aligned with or slightly higher than the living standards of local residents. The current standards for air defense, fire prevention, flood prevention, hygiene, etc., should be appropriately lowered.

Seventh, regarding housing construction. The state should mainly solve the problem of collective dormitories for workers, and can also build some low-standard apartments. At the same time, workers should be encouraged to build their own family dormitories. Workers' family dormitories cannot be completely solved in a relatively long period of time and can only be gradually solved in parts. The construction, management, allocation, and rent of workers' dormitories in cities are important issues related to urban construction and workers' lives, and should be fully and deeply investigated and studied, and discussed with workers to formulate correct policies and reasonable systems.

Eighth, in the next few years, generally no more office buildings, guest houses, rest houses, and large auditoriums will be built. When some cities must increase some public buildings and service buildings (such as schools, shops, hospitals, post offices, hotels, theaters, etc.), they should also make do with what is available, face the masses, and distribute reasonably.

Ninth, strictly control the scale of urban planning, reasonably lower various standards of urban construction, save investment, and save land. When building factories and schools, fully utilize the existing towns.

Tenth, in the future, all construction and installation units should, as far as possible, use the buildings of formal projects during basic construction, and build fewer or no temporary buildings. When it is necessary to build some temporary buildings, they should be limited to those necessary workshops and on-site processing plants, and generally no permanent building sites should be built. Existing permanent building sites should be gradually converted to other uses after the completion of the construction task.

We believe that by taking the above measures, we can rationally save the state's construction funds in basic construction, and can do more things with the same amount of money, so that China's construction industry can truly develop faster, better, and more economically. Comrades!

The 1957 national economic plan draft is relatively active and reliable. Under the condition of further deepening the production increase and cost reduction movement, with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, it is possible to overfulfill the plan. According to the inspection of the plan implementation situation from January to May this year, in the field of industrial production, the cumulative total output value has already completed 41.4% of the annual plan, an increase of approximately 11% from the same period last year; the increase in the production volume of several major industrial products compared to the same period last year is: electricity 1.36 billion kWh, raw coal 5.17 million tons, steel 650,000 tons, cement 2.6 million tons. The tense situation of supply of means of production has been somewhat eased. In the field of agricultural production, the yield of winter crops such as wheat has slightly increased compared to the previous year, while the yield of rapeseed has increased significantly; the planting situation of spring and summer crops is generally good; the planting area of rice and coarse grains has increased compared to the previous year, while the planting area of cotton has decreased; the number of pigs raised has also increased compared to the previous year. If there is no major natural disaster, agricultural production may be able to complete the plan. In the field of basic construction, by the end of May, the cumulative investment has already completed 25.1% of the annual plan, slightly lower than the level of the same period last year. In the market, the supply of means of production has increased; the supply of consumer goods, especially food, has also begun to improve. In the field of transportation, the tense situation of major routes is gradually improving. In summary, the implementation of the 1957 plan in the past few months has been relatively good. However, the agricultural harvest is currently difficult to determine, and various possible natural disasters should be prevented. In industrial production, some products have too few varieties, some products have unstable or declining quality, and efforts should be made to increase the variety of products and improve product quality. Some light industrial products will encounter certain difficulties in production due to insufficient raw materials in the second half of the year. In particular, due to the shortage of cotton, the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be further reduced compared to the plan. At the same time, although the supply of consumer goods has improved, some commodities are still relatively tight; although the supply of means of production has improved, it is generally still insufficient. Therefore, the people of the whole country must deeply carry out the production increase and cost reduction movement, explore every possible potential, strive to overcome difficulties, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the plan implementation process, and strive for the comprehensive completion of the 1957 national economic plan, and strive for more and better overfulfillment of China's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

    关于1956年度国民经济计划的执行结果和1957年度国民经济计划草案的报告
    1957年7月1日在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上
    国务院副总理兼国家经济委员会主任　薄一波各位代表：
    我谨向第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议提出关于1956年度国民经济计划的执行结果和1957年度国民经济计划草案的报告，请予审查。
    一、关于1956年度国民经济计划的执行结果
    1956年度国民经济计划的编制，是在以下的条件下进行的。1955年下半年开始形成了我国对于农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，这一高潮大大地推动了社会主义建设的高潮，广大群众的社会主义积极性空前高涨，要求提前完成五年计划。1955年农业的大丰收，粮食和棉花的产量是近三年来增长最多的一年。在执行第一个五年计划的前三年中，财力上有了一定的结余，物力上有了一定的储备，技术力量有了一定的成长，基本建设的设计、设备、施工组织都有了较好的准备。1956年度的计划，适应了这种新的形势，从而在财政经济上保证了社会主义改造的伟大胜利，并且保证了社会主义建设的顺利发展。计划中所规定的各项指标，都是很积极的。应该说，这个计划基本上是反映了人民群众在大革命、大建设的高潮中的愿望的。
    全国人民对于1956年度国民经济计划执行的结果，都很关心。现在，根据对计划执行结果的检查，我们可以向第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议报告说：1956年度我国国民经济计划的各项指标，绝大部分都已经完成或者超额地完成了。
    1956年是我国社会制度大变革的一年。在全国组织起来了75.6万个农业生产合作社，入社的农户占全国农户总数的96.3％，其中加入高级农业生产合作社的农户占全国农户总数的87.8％。在全国组织起来了约10万个手工业生产合作社和生产合作小组，参加的人数达到500多万人，约占手工业者总数的92％。在全国的资本主义工业中，占产值99.6％和占职工总数99％的工业企业，转变为公私合营企业；在全国的资本主义商业中，占总户数82.2％和占从业人员总数85.1％的商业企业，转变为国营、合作社营、公私合营企业和合作商店、合作小组。由于这一伟大的变革，我国就基本上解决了个体经济同社会主义工业化之间的矛盾，基本上解决了资本主义所有制同社会主义所有制之间的矛盾，从而基本上结束了我国几千年来阶级剥削制度的历史，建立起社会主义的社会经济制度。这样，在我国实行改变生产资料私有制为公有制的社会主义改造的任务，就基本上完成了。
    在社会主义革命的高潮的推动之下，我国的社会主义建设事业也获得了很大的发展。
    全国工业总产值1956年完成了586.6亿元，比上年增长31％，这是近年来工业生产增长速度最快的一年。在工业总产值中，生产资料的生产为291.7亿元，比上年增长41.7％；消费资料的生产为294.9亿元，比上年增长22％。机器制造业的生产为57.6亿元，比上年增长90.2％。手工业的生产为117亿元，比上年增长16％。
    按工业总产值计算，已经提前一年并且超额9.5％完成了五年计划（即五年计划所规定的1957年的指标，下同）。在五年计划所列的46种主要工业产品中，已经有生铁、钢、钢材、烧碱、纯碱、硝酸铵、青霉素、氯霉素、各种磺胺、汽车外胎、蒸汽锅炉、汽轮机、水轮机、内燃机、发电机、电动机、变压器、金属切削机床、双轮带铧犁、谷类播种机、客车、自行车、机制纸、水泥、棉纱、棉布、麻袋等27种产品的产量，提前一年完成或者超额完成了五年计划。1956年我国试制成功的新的工业产品，根据九个工业部的统计，即达1，200多种，其中喷气式飞机、载重汽车、15，000瓩的全套水轮发电设备、12，000瓩的汽轮机和汽轮发电机、单轴自动车床、耐高热合金钢等，都是运用了世界上新的技术在我国第一次生产的产品。现在，这些产品不仅已经试制成功，并且已经投入生产了。各工业部门的主要技术经济指标和主要工业设备的利用率，都比上年有了显著的提高。
    1956年各工业部（不包括森林工业部）所管理的工业企业，生产成本比上年降低了10.7％，扣除降低调拨价格的因素，比上年降低了7.9％（原计划降低8.4％），没有完成计划。生产工人的劳动生产率，比上年提高约26％（原计划提高18.6％）。应该指出，按生产工人计算的劳动生产率，不能反映工业劳动生产率提高的全面情况。因为在工业企业中，除了生产工人以外，还有不少的非直接生产的职工。目前在我国工业企业中的非直接生产的职工过多，一般要占生产工人总数的一半左右，这种不合理的情况，应该逐步改变。工业劳动生产率怎样计算才更合理，我们也正在研究改进办法。
    全国农业和农副业总产值1956年完成了582.9亿元，为计划的96％，比上年增长4.9％。1956年我国遭受了最近几十年来最严重的一次自然灾害，某些农作物受到很大的损失，受灾的农田面积约2.3亿亩，受灾的人口约7， 000万人。但是，由于农业合作化的胜利和“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的公布，在全国农民中掀起了热火朝天的农业增产运动，在扩大农田灌溉面积、增加农田施肥数量、精耕细作、推广优良品种等各方面，都取得了很大的成绩；受灾地区的广大农民，同灾荒进行了搏斗，缩小了灾荒所造成的损失，因而使主要农作物如粮食、大豆等的全国总产量，仍然有所增加。1956年粮食总产量为3，650亿斤，比上年增加了154亿斤，增长4.4％；大豆产量为204.7亿斤，比上年增加了22亿斤，增长12.2％；棉花产量为2，890万担，比上年减少了147万担，下降4.8％；猪的头数年末达到9，780万头，比上年增加了988万头，增长11.2％。1956年农业和农副业的总产值，已经接近完成五年计划；粮食的总产量则已经超额完成了五年计划。
    全国基本建设投资额有很大的增长。1956年完成了139.9亿元，为计划的99.9％，比上年增加了53.6亿元，增长62％。这是解放以来，投资额增长最多的一年，也是基本建设计划完成得最多的一年。1956年和前三年所完成的基本建设投资额累计计算，已经完成五年计划投资总额的86％左右。这样，超额完成五年计划中的基本建设计划就有充分的保证了。1956年施工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位共计625项，已经全部投入生产的有89项，其中主要的有：煤矿20项，电站21项，黑色和有色冶金3项，建筑材料4项，金属加工和机械制造21项，棉纺织和制糖等轻工业12项。1956年铁路铺轨3，108公里，其中：新建1，747公里，恢复285公里，新建和恢复复线210公里，新建企业专用线866公里（仅系铁道部负责修建的，下同）。宝成线和鹰厦线已经全线临时通车。1953至1956年铁路铺轨累计为7，532公里，其中：新建4，387公里，恢复324公里，新建复线356公里，恢复复线420公里，新建企业专用线2，045公里。新建铁路铺轨总数已经超过五年计划规定的铺轨总数303公里。基本建设计划执行的结果，各部门新的生产能力的增长，在我国历史上也是空前的，1956年一年中新增加的炼钢能力，就超过了解放前全部的炼钢能力。旧中国几乎没有的机器制造业，完全没有的汽车制造业和飞机制造业，现在都建设起来了。近代化的国防工业，也开始建设起来了。
    随着工农业生产的发展和基本建设规模的扩大，交通运输事业也有很大的发展，1956年全国铁路货运量完成了24，605万吨，超过计划11.6％，比上年增长27％；货物周转量完成了1，203.5亿吨公里，超过计划11.6％，比上年增长22.6％。都提前一年完成了五年计划。
    在经济事业发展的同时，全国文教卫生和科学研究事业在1956年也有很大的发展。高等学校招生18.5万人，超过计划5.2％；中等专业学校招生43.3万人，为计划的97.4％；初级和高级中学招生234.3万人，超过计划9.6％；初级和高级小学招生2，345.3万人，比上年增长35.6％。各级学校的学年初在校学生人数都比上年有很大的增长，中等专业学校、中学和小学的学年初在校学生人数都提前一年超过了五年计划。
    1956年中国科学院所属科学研究机构达到66所，研究人员（包括研究员、副研究员、助理研究员和研究实习员）达到4，475人。各高等学校的科学研究工作，比以前加强了。各部所属科学研究机构达到105所，研究人员（包括工程师和技术员）达到10，307人。同时，在国务院的领导下，由科学家们初步制定了中国科学发展的远景规划（草案）。
    1956年摄制影片176部，超过计划37.5％。电影放映队达到6，233队，为计划的97％。报纸发行243，942万印张（即对开报纸，下同），超过计划2.2％。杂志出版76，343万印张，为计划的89.3％。图书出版435，613万印张，超过计划16.2％。以上各项，都比上年有很大的增长。此外，图书馆、博物馆也都有所发展；艺术有了进一步的繁荣，民间艺人得到进一步的安排。
    1956年卫生部门所属的医院和研究所的病床总数达到214，673张，超过计划2.3％，比上年增加了40，980张。对于危害人民健康的各种慢性病的防治，特别是对于消灭血吸虫病的斗争，已经开始取得成绩，治疗了患者40万余人。为了继承和发扬祖国的医学遗产，并且发挥中医的作用，已经吸收了大约3万名中医参加公立卫生机构的工作。此外，在卫生防疫、医疗预防、妇幼卫生等各方面，也都进行了很多的工作。
    随着经济、文化建设事业的发展，1956年包括在国家计划以内的全国国营企业、合作社营企业、公私合营企业、国家机关、人民团体和文化、教育、科学、卫生部门的工人职员总数（以下简称包括在国家计划以内的职工总数）年底达到2，240万人；年平均人数（全年每日实有人数的累计数，除以365日，即得年平均人数，下同）为2，117.9万人，比上年增加了535.7万人，除去由私营工商企业等转变为国营、公私合营企业的人员和乡干部305万人以外，实际比上年新增加了230多万人。这是几年来就业人数增加最多的一年。如果将包括在国家计划以内的职工和不包括在国家计划以内的职工合在一起计算，那么，1956年底就是2，417万人，比计划以内达到的2，240万人多177万人。
    1956年包括在国家计划以内的职工的工资总额比上年增加了约27亿元，职工的年平均工资（全年职工的工资总额除以年平均人数，即得年平均工资，下同）增长了接近14％。农民的收入也有所增加，根据许多地区的调查，凡是没有受灾或者受灾不大的地区，约有80％左右的农业生产合作社增加了产量，约有75％左右的农户增加了收入。受灾地区虽然减产或者收成很少，但是经过农业生产合作社组织生产自救，加上政府的大力援助，除了个别工作不好的地区以外，受灾地区农民的生活也一般地得到了保障。
    1956年社会购买力达到约465亿元，比上年增长15.6％，这是在经济发展的基础上，人民物质生活有所改善的具体表现。
    总之，我们在1956年的工作是获得了极为巨大的胜利和成就的。这是在中国共产党的领导之下，全国工人、农民、知识分子、各民族、各民主党派、工商界人士和其他爱国人士团结一致、共同努力的结果。1956年我国社会主义改造事业的伟大胜利和经济建设事业的巨大发展，为我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的超额完成，奠定了可靠的基础。
    毫无疑问，我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设所获得的伟大的胜利和成就，将给我国今后国民经济的发展带来深远的极为有利的影响；但是，也给我们带来了某些困难。这些困难的发生，有的是由于客观的原因，有的则是同我们工作中的缺点和错误分不开的。
    现在看来，1956年工作中的缺点和错误，有以下几点是应该着重指出的：
    第一，1956年国家对基本建设的投资额多了约15亿元到20亿元。由于基本建设的投资额过大，因而造成了这样的情况：基本建设投资额增长的速度超过了生产资料生产增长的速度，特别是超过了建筑材料和某些机械设备生产增长的速度，从而就引起了钢材、木材和若干种机械设备供应的紧张情况。应该说，这是1956年计划工作中的一个错误，但是我们当时并不了解或者不完全了解，而是在后来才了解的。由于历年来的基本建设计划总有5％左右不能完成，在编制1956年的基本建设计划的时候，我们也以为会发生同样的情况。但是1956年基本建设计划执行的结果却完成了99.9％，因而就更加显出1956年的基本建设投资额是定得过大了。
    第二，1956年银行信贷计划，农业贷款增加11.2亿元，手工业和公私合营企业贷款增加2.9亿元。但是执行的结果，对农业的贷款却增加了20.3亿元，对手工业和公私合营企业的贷款却增加了9.4亿元。两项共计29.7亿元，超过计划15.6亿元。为了从财力上保证伟大的社会主义革命的胜利，增加这些贷款是完全必要的。这几项贷款的原定计划显然是小了。在执行过程中增加了这些贷款的数额，绝大部分是正确的。但是，如果撙节地加以使用，也可以少贷几亿元。在执行中有一小部分应该少贷的而没有能够少贷，是我们工作中的缺点。
    第三，1956年计划新增加工人职员84万人，但是执行的结果增加了230万人，超过计划146万人。由于经济的发展和许多事业的扩大超过了原定计划，在执行劳动计划的过程中稍稍超过原定计划也是必要的，但是显然超过得太多了。这是我们控制不严和有些部门轻易招收职工的结果。此外，在1956年增加了职工的工资，这在基本上是正确的，但是也有一部分人增加得多了一些。
    第四，1956年教育事业计划的招生指标有一部分定得过高了，在执行过程中又有某些方面超过了原定的指标，结果，就使有些学校招生的数量超过了师资、校舍和设备供应的可能条件，给师生在教学方面和生活方面带来了一些困难。
    由于以上的缺点和错误，在我国财政收支方面，出现了赤字；在银行信贷收支方面，也出现了差额，多发行了一部分贷币；这两者又集中表现为过多地使用了几年来国家所积蓄的商业库存和物资储备。这样，就给1957年经济工作和文教工作的安排，带来了某些困难和不利的影响。
    应该说，为了保证社会主义革命的伟大胜利，为了保证第一个五年计划的超额完成，为了顺利地渡过1956年的大灾荒，适当地使用国家的后备力量，是完全应该的，不使用是不正确的。这样做，虽然给我们今后的工作带来一些困难，但是这些困难只是暂时的和局部的，在今后的工作中是能够逐步克服的。我们还应该了解，历史上任何一次大革命，通常都是要在社会经济生活中引起大波动的。我们为了争取民主革命的胜利，曾经忍受了不知多大的牺牲和困难，而今天，我们在取得社会主义大革命的胜利的斗争中，并且在同时又取得大建设的胜利和渡过很大的灾荒，只引起这样一点小小的波动和困难，难道能够说我们的情况是不好的吗？应该说总的情况是很好的。由于我国社会主义计划经济的优越性，我们对于在大革命中所引起的社会经济生活的某些波动，可以自觉地在1957年及其以后的计划中加以调节。我们的物价基本上还是稳定的，国家若干后备物资在1957年就可以部分地得到补充，人民生活也还可能争取有所改善。这就是说，在1955年到1956年我国人民所取得的社会主义大革命的胜利，真是一次和平革命，我们最大限度地避免了在革命中可能引起的破坏和损失，这对于全中国的人民是极为有利的。
  二、关于1957年度国民经
    济计划草案的说明
    在1956年度国民经济发展的基础上，我们编制了1957年度的国民经济计划草案。如前面说过的，1956年我国社会主义改造已经取得伟大的胜利，社会主义建设事业进展很快，第一个五年计划的主要指标，有些已经提前完成，有些接近完成。这些是安排1957年度国民经济计划的有利条件。但是，1956年我国遭受了解放以来最严重的一次灾荒，对于1957年国民经济的各方面都有不利的影响；由于前面说过的1956年工作中发生的缺点和错误，使得经济工作和文化工作的某些方面，出现了一些迫切需要解决的矛盾。这些是安排1957年度国民经济计划的困难条件。根据上述有利条件和困难条件，在统筹兼顾，适当安排，瞻前顾后，综合平衡，增产节约，勤俭建国，发扬成绩，纠正缺点的方针下，我们编制了1957年度国民经济计划草案。
    大家知道，年度计划的编制必须做到既能调动各方面的积极性，又要有充分可靠的物力、财力的保证，并且保留必要的后备。1957年度国民经济计划的安排，是尽可能地使基本建设的增长同生产资料生产的增长相适应；使社会购买力的增长同消费资料生产的增长相适应；使文化、教育、科学事业的发展和劳动工资的安排同国民经济各部门的发展相适应；使国民经济各部门在上下年度之间能够比较平衡地向前发展。在安排消费同积累的关系的时候，首先保证必要的消费；在安排生产同基本建设所需要的物资的时候，首先保证必要的生产上的需要；在安排基本建设的时候，尽量地注意到各部门投资比例的适当，并且发挥投资的经济效果，力争使用同样数量的钱能够办更多的事。
    1957年度国民经济计划草案，已经印成专册，发给各位代表，其中详细数字，我不拟在这里重复了。现在，我仅就工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、运输事业、商业、文教卫生和科学研究事业、劳动工资等计划方面的一些主要问题，分别加以说明。
          （一）工业生产
      1957年工业生产的总产值计划安排为603.4亿元，比上年增长4.5％（这是按包括在国家计划以内的工业企业的总产值在1956年为577.2亿元进行比较的）。1956年工业总产值比上年增长31％，为什么1957年计划安排的工业生产的增长速度比上年降低这么多呢？
    在这里，除了生产资料中的新式畜力农具、锅驼机、水车等农业机械因为1956年生产过多，1957年计划基本上停止生产，机械制造工业的其他若干产品因为1957年计划安排的基本建设投资减少，它们的产值也将相应地有所减少以外，最主要的原因是1957年计划安排的消费资料的生产比1956年增加很少。消费资料生产在我国全部工业生产的总产值中所占的比重，1956年为50.3％，1957年计划为48.4％；而在消费资料生产中，纺织工业和食品工业产值所占的比重又最大，1956年为77.7％，1957年计划为77％。由于棉纱的产量1957年计划比上年减少61.1万件，使棉纺织工业的产值将减少14.4亿元，仅此一项，就使全部工业总产值的增长速度降低约2.5％。1957年计划安排的全部食品工业的产值比1956年增加2.2亿元，增加也很少。1957年的工业生产计划，由于纺织工业的生产下降，食品工业的生产增加很少，这样不仅使整个消费资料的生产计划只比上年增长1.1％，并且把1957年全部工业生产计划的增长速度也拉下来了。
    但是，把生产资料和消费资料生产的计划增长速度分开来看，情况是各不相同的。1957年计划安排的生产资料的生产为 311.3亿元，比上年增长8％；消费资料的生产为292.1亿元，比上年增长1.1％。
    1957年计划安排的生产资料主要产品的产量和增长速度如下：
    电力：188.6亿度，比上年增长13.7％。
    原煤：11，727万吨，比上年增长10.7％。
    原油：150万吨，比上年增长29％。
    生铁：555.4万吨，比上年增长16.3％。
    钢：498.7万吨，比上年增长11.7％。
    钢材：447.8万吨，比上年增长17％。
    烧碱：17.8万吨，比上年增长13.8％。
    硫酸铵：49.9万吨，比上年增长11.8％。
    水泥：680.7万吨，比上年增长6.5％。
    蒸汽锅炉：4，019.7蒸发量吨，比上年增长33％。
    汽轮机：14.35万瓩，比上年增长19.1％。
    发电机：28.4万瓩，为上年的98.9％。
    电动机：125.1万瓩，比上年增长17.7％。
    变压器：359.8万千伏安，比上年增长26.4％。
    金属切削机床：22，640台，比上年增长2.7％。
    载重汽车：7，000辆，比上年增长324.8％。
    原木：2，506万立方公尺（包括手工业生产量），比上年增长21.9％。
    从上列计划安排的生产资料主要产品的生产增长情况中，可以看出，绝大多数产品的产量，1957年比上年增长在10％以上，一半以上产品的产量，1957年比上年增长在15％以上。在1956年生产资料的生产比上年增长41.7％的基础上，还能够保持这样的发展速度，应该说是不慢的。这说明，我们在安排1957年度工业生产计划的时候，继续坚持了优先发展生产资料生产的原则，这对于我国社会主义建设事业的发展无疑是有利的。
    前面说过，1957年计划基本上停止新式畜力农具、锅驼机、水车等农业机械的生产，1957年计划安排的基本建设投资额比1956年有所减少，这就限制了机械制造工业生产的增长速度。1957年机械制造工业的产值计划安排为54.9亿元，相当于上年的95.6％。而1956年机械制造工业的生产则比上年增长90.2％。这样也就不能不影响到1957年生产资料生产的增长速度。如果把机械制造工业的产值从生产资料生产的总产值中剔除出去加以比较的话，则1957年计划安排的生产资料生产的增长速度就不是8％，而是11％以上。
    1957年计划安排的消费资料主要产品的产量和增长速度如下：
    棉纱：463.5万件，为上年的88.3％。
    棉布：50亿公尺（包括手工业生产量），为上年的85.3％。
    麻袋：7，814万条，为上年的99.3％。
    面粉：503万吨（包括手工业生产量），比上年增长0.2％。
    食糖：87.4万吨（包括手工业生产量），比上年增长8.3％。
    1957年计划安排的消费资料工业的生产，有些产品比上年增加很少，有些产品还比上年减产，这是什么原因呢？这主要是由于去年农业遭受灾害，主要的工业原料作物的生产，没有完成计划。1956年由于上年棉花丰收，同时进口的棉花也比较多，因此棉纱的生产比上年增长32.2％，但是，这样高的增长速度是难以为继的。因为我国农业的丰收或者歉收，在很大程度上是受自然条件的影响的。接连几年的丰收是少有的，在丰年之后，往往是平年或者是歉年。全国解放以来，我国农业有三年是丰年（1950、1952、1955），有两年是平年（1951、1953），有三年是歉年（1949、1954、1956）。在过去几年中，农业的丰收或者歉收，曾经多次地影响我国轻工业生产增长速度的起伏。农业的丰歉，影响到国民经济的波动，在我国目前的条件下是难于避免的；但是剧烈的波动，对于国民经济的发展是很不利的。因此，对于粮食、棉花和其他一部分工业原料作物，在可能的条件下，要有必要数量的储备，以调剂歉年之后的生产和消费，减轻社会经济生活的波动。今后我们在编制计划的时候，应该充分地注意到这一点。
    在手工业生产方面，存在的主要问题是原材料的供应比较紧张。我们在分配原材料的时候，对手工业生产的需要已经给予适当的照顾。例如：1957年棉布总的生产水平比上年下降15％左右，但是对于手工织布业的生产，则计划维持上年生产水平的90％左右；在钢铁材料的供应方面，除了手工业自己生产的土铁归他自己使用，各地回收的废钢铁首先满足手工业生产的需要以外，国家还从统一分配的钢铁材料中给手工业调剂了一部分。采取这些措施以后，1957年手工业生产的总产值，估计可以维持1956年的水平或者略高一些。
    为了保证手工业生产的顺利进行，手工业管理部门和手工业生产合作社应该继续调整生产组织，大力整顿社务，开展增产节约运动。在手工业生产合作社内部，目前存在着盲目地追求半机械化、机械化的倾向，变手工业生产合作社为国营工厂的倾向，应该加以纠正。同时，还应该扶助个体手工业者，不得加以排斥。
          （二）农业生产
    1957年农业和农副业总产值计划安排为611.5亿元，比上年增长4.9％。
    粮食（不包括大豆）总产量计划安排为3，820亿斤，比上年增加170亿斤，增长4.7％。
    棉花总产量计划安排为3，000万担，比上年增加110万担，增长3.8％。
    目前，我国农业的发展大大地落后于人民生活的要求，落后于轻工业发展的要求。因此，必须继续贯彻执行全国农业发展纲要（草案），贯彻执行勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，逐步地解决国家同合作社之间、合作社同合作社之间、以及合作社内部的矛盾，想尽一切办法，促进粮食和其他农作物的增产。国家对于农业的发展，一向采取积极支持的政策，为了保证继续提高农作物的单位面积产量，今后还将特别注意发展化学肥料工业，以增加肥料的供应量。开垦荒地需要投资较多，但是为了增加农业生产，根据国家的财力、物力的可能条件，增加一些投资，扩大耕地面积，也是必要的。
    前面说过，棉花和其他工业原料作物的增产，对于工业生产的增长影响很大。目前，我国轻工业有较大的生产能力，棉纱锭子已有700多万枚，每年可纺纱560万件以上，其他某些轻工业企业也有多余的生产能力。人们会问，为什么不可以多生产一些工业原料作物以充分发挥轻工业企业的生产能力呢？主要原因是由于我国人口增加很快，耕地面积增加有限，粮食的增加还满足不了人民消费增长的需要，在现有的耕地中不能更多地增加工业原料作物的种植面积。几年来，由于工业原料作物的种植面积逐年扩大，粮食作物的种植面积虽然也有所增加，但是，它的种植面积在各种农作物的种植面积中所占的比重，已经逐年有所下降。1957年各种农作物的种植面积计划安排为239，989万亩，比1953年增长11.1％，其中，工业原料作物为23，071万亩，比1953年增长31.9％；粮食作物为184，972万亩，比1953年增长7.9％。粮食作物在各种农作物种植面积中所占的比重，1953年为79.3％，1957 年下降为77.1％。为了保证全国人民的粮食供应，为了保证工业所需要的原料，必须适当安排粮食作物同工业原料作物种植面积的比例。在我国还不能大量开荒和大量扩大耕地面积以前，从现有的耕地中不适当地扩大工业原料作物的种植面积是不对的，但是，缩小现有的工业原料作物的种植面积，也是不利的。棉花、糖料、油料等主要工业原料作物，应该保持1957 年的种植面积，不再减少，还应该有小量的增加，并且必须进一步加强精耕细作和采用优良品种等有效的措施，以提高单位面积的产量。
    猪的增产也是大家很关心的，因为它不仅关系到城乡肉食的供应，而且养猪积肥也是当前农业肥料的重要来源之一。为了缓和城乡肉食供应的紧张情况，并且适应农业增产对于肥料的需要，必须提高猪的生产数量和质量。1957年猪的头数，年末计划达到1.1亿头，比上年增加1，220万头。完成这个计划，有没有保证呢？由于各级领导机关对于发展养猪业十分重视，生猪的收购价格全国平均提高了14.26％，农民养猪比较有利了；饲料的来源增多，国家给农民预留的精饲料也比上年增加了；再加上适当地增加农民的自留地，以利于农民自己解决蔬菜和牲畜饲料。这些都是完成计划的有利条件。另一方面，1957年计划安排的猪的头数，比产量最高的1954年还要超过1，000万头，现在不少地方猪的质量还不高，因此，需要作很大的努力，才能完成计划，并且提高猪的质量。但是，由于采取了上面的措施，目前商业部门收购的猪，数量已经开始增多，部分猪的质量也比上年肥大，可见农民对于养猪的积极性，已经有所提高，完成计划是有可能的。
    造林面积1957年计划安排为4，500万亩，比上年减少500万亩。为什么1957年计划造林面积比上年减少了呢？这是由于1953至1956年平均每年造林2，744.5万亩，面积不少，但是成活率比较低，根据典型调查，过去造林的成活率一般在60％左右。因此，必须在保证成活率确实能有显著提高的前提之下，努力完成今年的造林任务。在木材采伐方面，地方林区，过去一般在路远山深的地方采伐得少，在交通比较便利的地方采伐得多，这对于水土保持和林区迹地更新都有不利的影响。今年增加了地方木材采伐的投资，主要用在修路方面，以便增加深山的采伐量，逐步改变某些不利于水土保持和林区迹地更新的采伐情况。
          （三）基本建设
    1957年基本建设投资额计划安排为111亿元，为上年的79.4％。1957年的基本建设投资额的确定，在材料供应方面和财政方面，都进行过反复的平衡计算。经过多种方案的比较研究，我们采取了111亿元的方案。因为这个方案，既能够使1957年的基本建设保持适当的规模，保证超额完成第一个五年计划的建设任务，又有利于1958年计划的安排；既能够使1956年造成的某些原材料和某些机械设备的供应紧张情况缓和下来，有利于生产的发展，又可以尽量地减少建筑力量的窝工损失和设备的积压。111亿元的基本建设投资额同1956年的基本建设投资额相比，是显得少了。但是，同五年计划原来所规定的1957年投资额相比，还超过了14亿元；如果把前四年实现了的投资额和1957 年计划安排的投资额合起来计算，则超过五年计划规定的五年投资总额的49.78亿元。
    根据上述的基本建设投资额，在项目的安排方面，适当地调整了若干部门的投资比重，加强了薄弱环节。主要是：减少了非生产性建设的投资比重，增加了生产性建设的投资比重。减少了纺织工业、食品工业、机械制造工业等设备能力暂时还有多余的部门的投资比重，增加了煤炭、电力、冶金、化学、森林等生产能力不足的工业部门的投资比重。保持了农林水利部门的投资比重。增加了地方投资的比重，相应地减少了中央部门的投资比重。例如：非生产性建设的投资额占投资总额的比重，由1956年的22.4％，下降为1957年的20％左右。又如煤炭、电力、冶金、化学、森林等五个工业部1956年的投资额共为34.5亿元，占工业各部投资额的50％；1957年投资额计划共为37.1亿元，占工业各部投资额计划的59.1％。又如原材料、燃料、电力工业同金属加工、机械制造工业的投资比例，由五年计划中的1957年的1.9比1，改变为1957年计划的3.3比1。地方投资占全国投资总额的比重，由五年计划中的1957年的13.7％，提高到1957年计划的18.8％。
    在编制1957年度国民经济计划的时候，我们还认识到：在生产资料的生产方面，我国的原材料、燃料、电力工业的发展，落后于其他工业部门发展的要求；冶金工业的发展，落后于金属加工、机械制造工业发展的要求。在积极发展我国的原材料、燃料、电力工业方面，除了应该继续建设若干起骨干作用的大型企业以外，还应该特别注意多发展一些投资少、收效快的中、小型企业，和有计划地发展小煤矿、小铁矿、小的有色金属矿和非金属矿，以增加原材料和燃料的产量。在金属加工和机械制造工业方面，除了发展一些重型的和精密的机械工业企业以外，应该在平时和战时相结合、专业化和协作相结合、制造和修理相结合的前提之下，对各机械工业部所管理的企业、非机械工业部门和地方所管理的机械工业企业，统筹安排，以充分发挥我国金属加工和机械制造工业的潜在力量。这些工作，我们在1957年度计划的安排中，已经开始予以注意，今后还必须进一步解决这一方面的问题。
    按照上述投资安排，1957年计划施工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位共计591项，其中计划竣工的219项。各工业部1957年计划施工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位共计486项，其中计划竣工的177项。在计划竣工的项目中，主要的有：煤矿58项，电站21项，黑色和有色冶金14项，建筑材料和木材加工9项，金属加工和机械制造32项，纺织、造纸、食品等轻工业20项。这些企业投入生产达到设计能力以后，每年的生产量是：原煤1，080万吨，发电量33.6亿度（发电设备容量67.3万瓩），原油32.5万吨，生铁81万吨，钢材48.9万吨，焦炭157万吨，硫酸4万吨，硝酸铵9万吨，水泥108万吨，运出木材315万立方公尺，棉纱69.3万件（纱锭71.5万枚），棉布64，602万公尺（织布机21，325台），机制纸13.6万吨，机制糖8.7万吨，等等。但是，实践证明，新建企业在投入生产以后，经过一定时间，它的年产量，很多是会超过设计能力的。
    在农业基本建设方面，1957年农林水利各部和地方农业投资计划共为9.7亿元，比上年减少1.9亿元。主要是减少了中等技术学校、试验研究机构等建设单位的投资，和减少了拖拉机的增加数量。水利部1957年计划施工的限额以上的建设单位共计26项，其中有水库工程10项，黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程今年正式开工。地方兴修的限额以上的水利工程32项。农垦部兴建的限额以上的农牧场3项；地方兴建的限额以上的农场93项。1957年的基本建设投资额，在农业方面和工业方面都有减少，但是为了照顾农业发展的需要，我们在分配投资额的时候，已经注意到使农业方面少减一点，工业方面多减一点。
    1957年铁路计划铺轨1，860公里，其中：新建535公里，恢复152公里，新建复线533公里，专用线640公里。在新建铁路铺轨中：包（头）兰（州）线铺轨329公里，福建的南（平）琯（头）线铺轨63公里，内蒙古的牙克石森林线铺轨45公里。交通部1957年计划施工的公路有7条，其中主要的是新建新藏公路和改建青藏公路；计划新增加的公路里程为1，125公里。邮电部1957年除了重点建设部分市内电话和增加必需的邮运设备以外，计划架设京汉、京沪、京沈、京西（安）、西（安）兰（州）等长途电讯干线的十二路载波电话和改善省内线路。
    商业各部1957年计划施工的限额以上的建设单位共计17项，其中主要是肉类联合加工厂和冷藏库，计划新增加日宰猪1.1万头的生产能力和冷藏库容量5.15万吨。
    文教各部1957年计划施工的限额以上的建设单位共计37项，其中主要的有：高等学校（高等教育部和教育部直接管理的）11项，电影制片厂和洗印厂7项，医院4项；计划新建、扩建高等学校可以容纳新生3.3万人，新建医院增加床位1，420张。
    在1957年基本建设投资的安排中，根据勤俭建国的方针，在保证工程质量的前提下，修改了某些过高的和不适当的设计标准，尽可能地照顾了各个部门之间、各个工厂之间的专业分工和协作配合，减少了非生产性建设的投资，削减了非急需的项目和缩小了某些企业的规模，并且尽可能地就地取材，降低建筑造价。采取这些措施以后，就节约了资金，提高了投资的经济效果。为了进一步贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，需要对原定的设计和规划作必要的修改，这是一件复杂细致的工作，做得好就可以大量节约，做得不好还可能造成新的浪费。因此，必须节约一切可能节省的投资，同时反对偷工减料，用各种办法提高工程质量。不久以前召开了全国设计工作会议，已经开始对原定的各项设计和规划进行全面的审查修改工作。我们相信，在全国职工、全国勘察设计和建筑安装工程技术人员的积极努力之下，一定会把勤俭建国的方针进一步地坚持下去，为国家节省大量的资金，把建设事业办得更好。
          （四）运输事业
    1957年的运输计划，是适应工、农业生产的发展和基本建设的规模来安排的。
    在铁路运输方面，货运量计划安排为25，600万吨，比上年增长4％；货物周转量计划安排为1，265亿吨公里，比上年增长5.1％。
    1953至1956年新建的铁路，沟通了我国西北地区、西南地区、中原地区和沿海地区相互之间的联系，这对我国经济的发展起了很大的作用。可是，随着生产和建设的发展，随着新线的通车和运量的增加，旧线的负担也大大地加重了，以致有些区段如京汉、石太、同蒲、陇海西段等线路的通过能力，在1956年就感到严重不足，曾经发生了堵塞的现象。为了改变这种现象，1957年适当地增加了加强旧线的投资，加强旧线的投资额在铁道部投资额中所占的比重，由1956年的26.4％，提高到1957年的39.4％，计划在京汉、石太、陇海等线的某些区段修建复线533公里。经过采取了这些措施和加强运输的组织工作以后，预计铁路运输的通过能力将有所增加。
    在水路运输方面，长江的运输能力，过去四年增加了船舶230，620载重吨，1957年计划增加32，600载重吨，五年合计超过原计划2，520载重吨。这对保证四川省的粮食及其他农产品的外运和各地工业品运进西南各省，有很大的作用，从1956年下半年至1957年上半年已经由水路运出了40余亿斤粮食，支援了受灾地区和缺粮地区。但是，长江的运输特别是川江的运输情况还是很紧张的。这是由于港口的建设落后于船舶运输能力的增加；中、下游的运输能力的增加，没有同上游运输能力的增加相适应。为此，1957年计划加强重庆、汉口等港口的建设，并且建造拖轮以增加长江中、下游的运力。在运输管理工作中，也已经开始注意加强港口管理，注意港口、航行和修船工作之间的协作配合。
    西南各省是我国人口众多、物产丰富的地区，它有许多农副业产品可以用来支援全国，同时全国各地也必须用许多工业品支援西南。目前最大的困难就是运输能力不够，虽然增加了长江的船舶，新建了宝成铁路，还不能适应经济发展的需要，因此，除了继续加强水路运输以外，还必须着手进行新的铁路干线建设的准备工作。
    由于我国目前石油生产落后，液体燃料供应不足，因此，在今后一定时期内，不可能大量发展汽车运输。为了适应工农业生产和建设事业发展的需要，在充分发挥铁路和水路现代运输工具的运输能力的同时，应该注意发挥各种民间运输工具的作用。现在各省、自治区、直辖市根据当地的具体情况，组织利用各种民间运输工具，已经起了很好的作用，今后还应该继续加强这方面的工作。
    为了保证1957年运输计划的完成，一切运输部门都必须加强运输的组织领导工作，提高运输设备的利用效率。在各运输部门之间，应该推行联运制度，签订运输协作合同，做好运输的协作配合工作。各产、销部门和运输部门应该大力贯彻执行合理运输和统一送货制度，并且注意平衡运输。
            （五）商业
    1957年社会购买力估算约为473.2亿元，比上年增加8.2亿元，增长1.8％。这个社会购买力的计划，一方面是估算了农民在农业生产正常的情况下可能增加的购买力，估算了职工工资总额的增加部分，两项合计，居民的购买力计划比上年增加约18亿元；另一方面，由于压缩了机关、部队、企业、人民团体等社会集团的购买力，计划比上年减少9.8亿元。这样，增减相抵，1957年社会购买力计划比上年增加8.2亿元。
    在商品供应方面，1957年社会商品供应总额估算约为463.5亿元。商品供应同社会购买力之间，虽然有一些差额，但是经过认真地开展增产节约运动，尽量开辟原材料的来源增加消费品的生产，有计划地组织一部分商品的进口，并且加强商品供应工作，加上今年春季对于若干种商品价格的调整，这样就可以使社会购买力同商品供应接近平衡，市场物价就可以继续保持稳定。
    在1956年农业遭受严重灾害之后，国家从丰收的西南地区调运出来50.8亿斤粮食，支援受灾地区和缺粮地区，仅仅河北一省就调入36.3亿斤，使广大受灾地区的农民免于饥饿，使缺粮地区的粮食供应得到保证，同时避免了粮食价格的上涨。由于棉花遭灾减产，1957年棉纱产量计划比上年减少约61.1万件，以致棉布的销售量将比上年减少2，300万匹左右，不得不把1957年5月份至8月份通用的第二期布票一律对折使用。这样，虽然减少了棉布的供应量，但是也避免了棉布价格的上涨。国家在大力稳定粮食、棉布等主要商品价格的同时，主动地提高了若干种商品的价格，作为平衡社会购买力的方法，从全局来看，我们认为这种措施是合理的和必要的。
    这里，简单地谈一下1957年对外贸易计划的安排情况。
    1957年计划安排的进出口贸易总额，约相当于1956年进出口贸易总额的91.6％。在出口计划方面，主要是减少了粮食、食油、猪肉的出口数量，以照顾国内的需要。例如，1957年计划出口粮食（包括大豆）38亿斤，比上年减少10.8亿斤；计划出口猪肉（包括活猪）7.7万吨，比上年减少8.5万吨。在进口计划方面，主要是减少了一般机械和运输机械的进口数量，以促进我国机械制造工业的发展。
    我国的对外贸易，过去几年，在出口总额中，农产品和农产加工品约占75％左右，矿产品和机械等约占25％左右。在进口总额中，机器和各种设备约占60％左右，黑色金属和有色金属约占10％左右，其他工农业生产资料和消费资料约占30％左右。这种出口和进口中各类产品所占的比重，随着我国工业的发展和人民消费水平的提高，将逐渐发生变化。在出口总额中，农产品和农产加工品的出口额所占的比重，将逐年下降；矿产品和其他工业品的出口额所占的比重，将逐年上升。在进口总额中，机器设备的进口额所占的比重，将逐年下降；工农业生产所需要的某些原材料和人民生活需要的某些消费资料的进口额所占的比重，将逐年上升。这种变化，在1957年对外贸易计划
  的安排中，已经有所表现。当然，为了适应我国社会主义工业化的要求，这种变化也只能是逐渐的。
    （六）文教卫生和科学研究事业
    在教育事业方面，由于1956年学校招生有一部分过多，以致师资和校舍建筑、教学设备都赶不上发展的需要。1957年根据师资和财力、物力方面的可能条件，适当地缩减了各级学校的计划招生人数，使学校能够有较多的精力，进行整顿，提高教学质量。
    1957年各级学校的计划招生数和学年初在校学生人数（以下简称在校数），安排情况如下：
    初级和高级小学招生1，616.9万人，在校数达到6，581.4万人，比上年增长3.7％。
    初级和高级中学招生184.3万人，在校数达到556.6万人，比上年增长7.8％。
    中等专业学校（包括中等技术学校和中级师范学校）招生15.8万人，在校数达到77.5万人，相当于上年的水平。
    高等学校招生10.7万人，在校数达到44.3万人，比上年增长10％。
    1957年各级学校的计划招生数，虽然比上年减少了，但是学年初在校学生人数都还有不少的增加。在解决由于上年招生过多所发生的问题和今年在校学生人数增加以后的问题上，还有很多的困难，教育部门和各级学校应该努力克服这些困难。社会各方面的人士，也应该帮助教育部门克服困难。
    应该指出，教育事业只能在生产发展的基础上逐步发展。我国普通教育的目的，主要的是培养忠实于社会主义事业的、有相当文化水平的、身体健康的体力劳动者，其次才是为培养专门人材打好普通知识的基础。从现在起，我们就应该强调并且逐步实施脑力劳动同体力劳动相结合的制度。一方面，应该鼓励脑力劳动者参加一部分可能参加的体力劳动；同时，还应该动员现在机关中工作的青年知识分子，离开机关工作岗位，到农村中、工厂中种几年地、做几年工，以学习和掌握生产知识，并且熟习工、农劳动人民的生活、感情和思想。另一方面，应该加强工农群众的业余教育，逐步地提高体力劳动者的文化水平；同时，还应该经常从工、农劳动人民中，有计划地挑选与群众有密切联系的、并且有一定的文化水平和工作能力的人，到机关中工作，以便加强机关工作人员同工、农劳动人民的经常联系。现在还有许多学龄儿童不能入学，这在目前还不可避免。不能入学的学龄儿童，只好晚一些入学。小学、中学毕业生的大部分不能逐级升学，应该参加体力劳动，这是一种正常的合理的现象。不能升学的中、小学毕业生，已经到达劳动年龄的，凡是家在农村的，应该说服和支持他们回农村参加生产；家在城市的，如果在城市安排不了，也应该尽可能地动员和安排他们到农村从事农业劳动。这是在今后相当长的时期内所必须采取的方针。
    在我国人民生活逐步提高的情况下，除了合理地使用国家办学的力量以外，群众办学的方法应该积极提倡。机关、团体和企业的职工，可以自己出钱集体办学（不由机关、企业拨款）；农民和城市居民也可以组织起来，集体办学；知识分子可以合作办学；热心教育事业而又有条件个人办学的人，也可以个人办学。总之，小学和中学教育，应该采取多种多样的办法来进行。国家用于教育事业的经费将逐年增加，计划所安排的中、小学招生数，也将逐年有所增长。但是，国家的物力、财力有限，因此，教育经费和招生人数每年不能增加很多。各省、自治区和直辖市可以根据本地区的情况，在不增加国家拨款的限度内，组织各方面的力量，集体地或者个体地来办小学、中学或者其他的学校，是能够多招收一些学生进行学习的。
    今年中等专业学校，除了中级师范学校将继续在初中毕业生中招收新生以外，中等技术学校计划从现有企业的职工中招收新生。
    高等学校今年在校学生人数的增长还是不小的。我们要求巩固已有的成绩，克服缺点，努力提高教学质量。
    在卫生事业方面，继续贯彻执行预防为主的方针，继续开展群众性的爱国卫生运动，仍然是1957年卫生工作的中心任务。乡村医疗工作，应该进一步发挥基层卫生组织的作用，更多地组织门诊、出诊和巡回医疗；城市应该注意发挥联合诊所的作用和适当地增设联合诊所，合理地改进公费医疗制度，以便腾出更多的医疗力量，来照顾城市一般居民的治病要求。不论乡村或者城市，都应该进一步地发挥中医的作用。
    在科学研究事业方面，1957年全国科学研究计划草案，已经科学规划委员会制定。在自然科学方面，我国第一个研究原子核的功率为7，000瓩的重水型原子反应堆和能产生2，500万电子伏的а粒子的回旋加速器，正在加紧建设中。1957年中国科学院将着手建设几个重要学科的研究所，如电子学、计算技术、半导体、自动化、核子物理、力学等研究单位，为今后新技术的发展建立科学研究的基础。中国科学院、高等学校、各部和各地方的科学研究工作，应该在科学规划委员会的领导之下，统筹安排，分工协作，以合理地使用科学研究的人员和设备，提高科学研究的质量，促进科学研究事业的发展。
    在文化、出版事业方面，应该给地方以较大的机动权限，1957年文化事业的各项计划指标，各省、自治区和直辖市可以根据分配的经费和基本建设投资，因地制宜地进行调整。
    在体育事业方面，应该继续开展群众性的体育运动。
          （七）劳动工资
    1957年包括在国家计划以内的职工总数，年底计划达到2，226.2万人，比上年减少约14万人。1957年的年平均人数，计划安排为2，216.8万人，比上年增长4.7％。
    为什么1957年年底计划达到的职工总数要比1956年年底的实有人数减少呢？这是因为我们在年度计划的执行过程中，存在着这样的缺点，即建筑安装部门的许多单位第四季度赶工，生产部门和商业部门的许多单位第四季度赶任务，大量增加职工，而到下一年的第一季度就要窝工。我们初步接受了这些经验教训，1957年要尽可能地克服这一缺点适当地减少职工人数。这一缺点的造成，是同劳动计划控制不严，年度计划下达时间过晚，财政上的年终结算制度执行有缺点等等分不开的，因此，今后应该合理地安排计划，提前下达任务，纠正执行财政上的年终结算制度的缺点，以便使各经济单位有可能均衡地进行生产和均衡地完成计划。同时，一切企业和事业单位，除了经上级批准的，需要赶工或者赶任务的个别特殊的工程或者企业、事业单位以外，都不得在第四季度赶工或者赶任务。过去不少单位用增加人员、加班加点以及其他不正当的手段来超额完成任务，甚至以此贪图奖金，这不仅浪费人力、物力，同时使工程质量、产品质量和工作质量下降，这种做法是错误的，应该坚决纠正。1956年第四季度增加了100多万职工，其中一半以上是临时工和季节工。根据不完全的统计，今年第一季度已经有不少万人回乡进行农业生产去了。这就证明，1957年年底达到的职工总数，比上年减少约14万人，是合理的，也是可能的。
    我国人口多，劳动资源丰富。目前我国厂矿企业的职工已有多余，而工业又只能逐步地发展，不可能每年都大量招收职工。因此，今后劳动就业不能只在工业方面打主意，而要更多地在农业、农副业和手工业方面打主意。
    1957年包括在国家计划以内的职工的工资总额，计划安排为141.2亿元，比上年增加12.1亿元，增长9.4％。其中：（1）1956年增加的工资是从四月一日或者七月一日起发给的，只发了两个或者三个季度，1957年要发四个季度，再加上某些正常的升级，这一项比上年增加约5.7亿元；（2）1956年各个月份陆续增加的职工，1957年都要支领全年的工资，连同1957年人数增减相抵以后，这一项比上年增加约6.4亿元。
    以上所说的七个方面的问题，就是1957年度国民经济计划中的一些主要问题。
    各位代表！1957年是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的最后一年。1957年度的国民经济计划完成以后，我国第一个五年计划的执行结果将会是怎样的呢？现在，对于我国第一个五年计划的可能完成情况作一些预计，我想是有必要的，也是全国人民所欢迎的。
    1957年的工业总产值计划安排为603.4亿元，超过五年计划12.7％。这样，我国第一个五年计划期间，工业生产增长的速度，平均每年的递增率将是17.4％，比原定的14.7％的增长速度加快了。生产资料的生产和消费资料的生产的比重，将由1952年的39.7比60.3，变为1957年的51.6比48.4。我国钢的生产量，将由1952年的134.9万吨，提高到1957年的498.7万吨，为解放前最高年产量的5.4倍。由于我国新的工业企业不断地投入生产和技术力量的不断地成长，已经出现了许多新的工业生产部门和新的工业产品。在1953至1956年，我国已经试制成功并且开始成批生产的最重要的新产品有：喷气式飞机、载重汽车、6，000瓩和12，000瓩的全套火力发电设备、10，000瓩和15，000瓩的全套水力发电设备、31，500千伏安的变压器、日产160吨钢的平炉、滚筒直径4公尺的电动卷扬机、多种型式的自动车床和机床、矽钢片、优质薄板、无缝钢管、50公斤的重轨、大型工槽钢、铝材、高纯度的苯胺和磷甲苯胺等等。1957年我国计划继续试制和开始试制的主要新产品有：72，500瓩的全套水力发电设备、25，000瓩的全套火力发电设备、40，500千伏安的变压器、2，500吨的水压机、700公厘的全套轧钢机、80吨（车身重）的电机车、载货量5，000吨的沿海货轮、载油量4，500吨的沿海油轮、40马力的拖拉机、四轴自动车床、组合机床和铟、硒、碲、锗、镓、钴稀有金属产品等等。
    1957年的农业和农副业总产值计划安排为611.5亿元，超过五年计划2.5％。这样，我国第一个五年计划期间，农业和农副业生产增长的速度，平均每年的递增率将是4.8％，比原定的4.3％也将超过。我国粮食的产量，将由1952年的3，088亿斤，提高到1957年的3，820亿斤，而在1949年只有2，162亿斤。我国棉花的产量，将由1952年的2，607万担，提高到1957年的3，000万担，而在1949年只有888万担。
    1957年的基本建设投资额计划安排为111亿元，超过五年计划的1957年投资额14％，加上前四年已经实现了的投资额，预计可以达到477.22亿元，比原定的五年投资总额超过11.6％。在第一个五年计划期间施工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位将达到825项，比原定的694项超过131项。在第一个五年计划期间竣工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位将达到448项，比原定的455项减少7项，主要是因为有些建设单位的规模扩大了，有些建设单位的进度延迟了。各工业部五年预计竣工的限额以上的厂矿企业建设单位共计350项，其中主要的有：煤矿94项，电站37项，炼油厂和油矿7项，黑色和有色冶金20项，化学工业10项，建筑材料和木材加工13项，金属加工和机械制造108项，纺织、造纸、食品等轻工业45项。五年预计新增加的生产能力，按每年的生产量计算，主要的有：原煤4，528万吨，发电量104.7亿度（发电设备容量209.4万瓩），天然石油和人造石油126.5万吨，生铁309.4万吨，钢217万吨，钢材114.9万吨，水泥239.3万吨，棉纱161万件（纱绽166万枚），棉布14.1亿公尺（织布机46，552台），机制纸21.5万吨，机制糖15.5万吨。这些都是按设计能力计算的，前面说过，很多企业的实际生产能力，是会超过设计能力的。
    1957年包括在国家计划以内的职工的年平均人数，计划安排为2，216.8万人，社会就业面比五年计划扩大了。职工的年平均工资，计划比1952年增长约37％左右，超过原定增长33％的水平。绝大多数农民的收入，在生产增长的基础上，也有相当的增加。高等学校、中等专业学校、高级和初级中学、高级和初级小学，计划安排的学年初在校学生人数，比五年计划超过2％到18％。
    因此，实现了1957年度的国民经济计划，除了个别的建设项目、个别的产品和某些事业的发展指标以外，绝大多数的建设项目、绝大多数的产品和绝大多数的事业的发展指标，都可以超额地完成我国的第一个五年计划。
    现在，我们完全可以这样说，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划将要完成和超额完成了。我国社会主义工业化的初步基础将要建立起来了。我国基本上已经能够用自己制造的设备，建设自己的电站、采矿企业、中型冶金企业、金属加工企业、化学工业企业和轻工业企业了。我国已经开始用自己制造的机械，装备自己的运输部门、农业部门和加强国防了。我国也已经能够用自己生产的金属材料，来满足规模不断扩大的建设事业的大部分需要了。我国人民知道，这些成就，是同苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家对我国的援助分不开的，我们应该对他们的援助再一次表示深切的感谢。
    三、为实现1957年度的国民经济计划而奋斗
    为了保证1957年度国民经济计划的完满实现，必须在全国范围内贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，进一步开展增产节约运动。
    增产节约，勤俭建国，是发展社会主义经济、扩大社会主义积累的基本方法。它不仅是保证1957年度国民经济计划实现的根本措施，而且是一个长期的带有战略意义的方针。
    关于在国民经济各部门和机关、部队、学校、团体中贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针和开展增产节约运动的问题，中共中央和国务院都已经发出指示，政协全国委员会也向全国发出了号召，不再重复。这里我只想着重地说一说在基本建设的各个方面，如何进一步地贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针的问题。因为基本建设的问题，是我国现阶段经济生活和政治生活中头等重要的问题。而在建设事业中如果能够从各方面很好地贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，就可以保证我国在三个五年计划或者更多一点的时间内，实现社会主义工业化。
    大家都可以看得见，过去几年我国的建设事业获得了巨大的成就。许多新的工业企业建设起来了，许多新的工业城市出现了，许多原有的城市的工业大大地发展了，许多消费城市开始改变为生产城市。但是，应该指出，由于我们缺乏建设的经验和国家机关的有关领导部门工作中发生的缺点和错误，使我国的建设事业，还存在着不少的缺点，使国家有限的财力、物力，没有能够充分地发挥作用。例如，在工业建设方面，对于新建和改建企业项目的安排注意较多，而对于合理地利用我国原有的中、小型企业和手工业注意不够。在工业的技术政策方面，某些地方不适当地强调了大规模、现代化和高标准，而对于建设中、小型的企业，很好地利用我国劳动力多的优点，则注意不够。在工业建设的设备供应方面，有些可以用自己能够制造的设备而不愿意用，要求从国外进口同类的设备。在工业建设的相互配合方面，不注意组织生产的协作，而要建设全能的工厂。建筑的安全、卫生、防空、防火、防洪标准偏高，城市规划过大，办公楼、招待所、休养所、大礼堂等盖得过多，在这些方面或多或少地存在着一种脱离实际、脱离群众、追求豪华、铺张浪费的不良现象。所有这些缺点，都给我国的建设事业造成了一些损失。我们应该好好地总结经验教训，纠正这些缺点，使我国建设事业的发展更加适应于我国经济落后、人多地少、农业比重大和人民生活水平低的现实情况。为此目的，我们准备有步骤地采取以下各项措施：
    第一，新工业企业的建设，应该充分考虑现有工业、农业、手工业的生产能力及其相互关系，统筹兼顾，适当安排，以便迅速地增加生产，相互促进其发展；而避免相互排挤，阻碍生产的发展。
    第二，在工业建设中，应该采用适合于我国经济条件和工业水平的技术装备。为着我国的工业化，必须建设一批用最新技术装备起来的现代企业作为骨干。但是，其他企业的建设，应该提倡最新技术同一般技术相结合，机械化、半机械化同手工操作相结合。
    第三，大型企业的建设，要同中、小型企业的建设相结合，并且今后应该多建中、小型企业。
    第四，除了某些我们自己还不能设计的、技术水平最先进的企业的建设，必须请苏联和有关社会主义兄弟国家帮助设计和供应设备之外，一般中、小型企业和中等技术水平的企业的建设，应该努力自行设计和自行制造设备。只要是自己能够制造的设备，即使质量差一点，也应该采用。
    第五，以市或者一个地区为单位，尽可能地统一安排企业的协作，临近的工厂，力求共同使用辅助车间、附属车间和实验室。
    第六，降低建筑标准。生产性建筑的标准，包括厂房在内，应该在能够保证建筑的质量、保证生产顺利进行的原则下，力求节约，而不应该追求过高标准。宿舍的建筑标准，不论城市或者乡村，一般应该同当地居民的住宅水平看齐或者稍高一些。现在采用的防空、防火、防洪、卫生等标准，应该适当降低。
    第七，关于住宅建设。国家主要应该解决职工的集体宿舍，也可以建设一部分标准较低的公寓。同时，应该鼓励职工自建家属宿舍。职工家属宿舍在相当长的时间内是不能完全解决的，只能是一部分、一部分地逐步解决。城市职工宿舍的修建、管理、分配和租金等问题，是关系到城市建设和职工生活的重要问题，应该全面地深入地进行调查研究，并且同职工进行讨论，以制定正确的政策和合理的制度。
    第八，在今后若干年内，一般不再建设办公大楼、招待所、休养所和大礼堂。某些城市必须增加一些公共建筑和服务性的建筑（如学校、商店、医院、邮电局、旅馆、影剧院等等）的时候，也应该因陋就简，面向群众，合理分布。
    第九，严格控制城市规划的规模，合理地降低城市建设的各项标准，节约投资，节约用地。在建设工厂和学校的时候，应该充分利用原有的城镇。
    第十，今后所有建筑安装单位，在进行基本建设的时候，应该尽可能地利用正式工程的建筑物，少建或者不建临时性的建筑物。在必须建设某些临时性的建筑物的时候，也应该只限于那些必要的工棚和现场性的加工场，一般地不再建设永久性的建筑基地。现有的永久性的建筑基地，在建筑任务完成之后，它的全部建筑物，包括办公、住宅、福利等建筑物在内，应该逐步地改作他用。
    我们相信，采取上述措施，就可以在基本建设方面合理地节约国家的建设资金，就可以用同样数量的钱而能够办更多的事，使我国的建设事业真正能够又多、又快、又好、又省地向前发展。各位代表！
    1957年度的国民经济计划草案是比较积极的和充分可靠的。这个计划在进一步地深入开展增产节约运动的条件下，在全国人民的一致努力下，是可能超额完成的。根据今年一月份到五月份计划执行情况的检查，在工业生产方面，总产值累计已经完成年度计划的41.4％，比1956年同期增长了11％左右；几种主要的工业产品比1956年同期增产的数量是：电力13.6亿度，原煤517万吨，钢材65万吨，水泥26万吨。生产资料供应的紧张状况，已经有所缓和。在农业生产方面，冬播作物小麦的产量比上年略有增加，油菜籽的产量则比上年有较多的增产；春播、夏播作物的种植情况，一般良好；水稻、杂粮的种植面积都比上年扩大，而棉花的种植面积，则有所缩小；猪的饲养头数，也较上年有所增长。如果没有特大的自然灾害，农业生产可能完成计划。在基本建设方面，到五月底止，投资额累计已经完成年度计划的25.1％，略低于1956年同期水平。在市场方面，供应市场的生产资料已有增加；消费资料，特别是副食品的供应，也开始有所好转。在交通运输方面，主要线路的紧张状态，也在逐步改善。总之，1957年度的计划，过去几个月的执行情况是比较好的。但是，农业的收成目前尚难断定，还应该预防各种可能发生的自然灾害。工业生产中，有些产品的品种过少，有些产品的质量不稳定或者有些下降，还应该积极地增加产品品种，提高产品质量。某些轻工业产品由于原料不足，在下半年的生产中还会遇到一定的困难。特别是由于棉花不足，棉纱、棉布的产量比计划还要减少。同时消费资料的供应，虽有某些好转，但少数商品仍然比较紧张；生产资料的供应虽有改善，但总的说来还感到不足。因此，全国人民必须深入地开展增产节约运动，千方百计地挖掘潜在力量，努力克服困难，加强计划执行过程中的监督检查工作，为全面地完成1957年度国民经济计划而奋斗，为更多地、更好地超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。（附图片）
