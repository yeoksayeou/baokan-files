Whether Someone is a Good Person Depends on Their Words and Deeds (Sakya Adage from Tibet)

    A "good horse" can only be known when it is walking.
    "Gold and silver" can only be known when they are melted.
    A "fierce elephant" can only be known when it is fighting.
    A "good person" can only be known through their words and deeds.
    Correct shortcomings with correct theory,
    Only by examining oneself from the bottom of one's heart can one make progress;
    If it's just like washing away dirt from the body,
    It will soon be re-soiled.
    Who would dare to be friends
    with an ungrateful person?
    Which farmer would be willing to cultivate
    a land that never yields a harvest?
          (Selected and translated by Wang Yao)

    是否好人，要看他的言行（西藏萨迦格言）
    “良马”在它走道儿的时候才能知道。
    “金银”在它溶化的时候才能知道。
    “猛象”在它战斗的时候才能知道。
    “好人”在他的言行中才能知道。
    用正确的理论改正缺点，
    从心底下检查才能进步；
    若是像洗去体外的污垢一样，
    不久又会沾上身来。
    忘恩负义的人，
    谁敢跟他做朋友？
    永远没有收获的土地，
    哪一个农夫愿来耕耘？
          （王尧选译）
