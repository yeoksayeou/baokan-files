Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have overfulfilled the state production plan for the first half of the year for four major products: metallurgical coke, pig iron, steel, and steel materials. They have also completed the portion of the annual increase production and practice economy plan that was due to be completed in the first half of the year. The overproduction of the four major products in the first half of the year compared to the plan is as follows: approximately 30,000 tons of metallurgical coke, approximately 33,000 tons of pig iron, approximately 43,000 tons of steel, and approximately 95,000 tons of steel materials, representing increases of 13% to 73.7% compared to the same period last year.

Under the premise of saving raw materials, metals, and reducing costs, various enterprises under the administration have achieved many new accomplishments in various specialized production areas in the first half of the year. In coke production, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has successfully conducted coke production experiments using local resources, and the quality of the coke meets the requirements. This has resulted in the rational utilization of resources, and coupled with savings in transportation costs and increased coal washing recovery rate, a total of more than 400,000 yuan can be saved annually. In ironmaking, despite the continued decline in the grade of iron ore, various enterprises have come up with many methods (such as increasing the use of artificial rich ore and raising the wind temperature) to still achieve increased production. In steelmaking, factories have overcome the difficulties of insufficient scrap steel supply, and open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and converters can all use less scrap steel, increase the use of pig iron, and take corresponding measures to ensure the quality of the steel. Due to the improved operations in various factories, the amount of rejects has been reduced and the smelting loss has been reduced. In the first half of the year, open-hearth furnaces and converters alone saved approximately 11,000 tons of steel materials. In steel rolling, enterprises have universally promoted the experience of rolling steel according to negative tolerances. Preliminary statistics show that the metal saved in the first half of the year has increased the country's steel material production by approximately 12,000 tons. In addition, enterprises have successfully trial-produced many new products to meet the needs of national production and construction.

There were also some shortcomings in production in the first half of the year, such as the insufficient popularization of advanced experiences in increasing production and practicing economy in some enterprises, and the occurrence of many accidents in production. Currently, the administration is organizing its subordinate enterprises to continue to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement, based on the experience and lessons learned from the production work in the first half of the year, and strive to overfulfill the annual production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The 46 paper mills directly under the Ministry of Light Industry produced 22,200 tons more paper and paperboard than the state plan in the first half of this year, exceeding the plan by 9%. The total output increased by 22% compared with the first half of last year. Major products such as newsprint, No. 4 letterpress paper for printing general books, No. 1 coated paper for printing pictorials, cigarette paper, and cement bag paper have all exceeded the state plan.

The shortage of raw materials was a major difficulty for increasing paper production in the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, the staff and workers of various factories came up with many ways to open up sources of raw materials and use substitute raw materials. Factories also took measures in production technology to reduce raw material consumption and increase production. From January to May, paper mills saved a total of 3,500 cubic meters of wood and 2,300 tons of reeds by reducing raw material consumption.

### 钢铁工业管理局四种主要产品  钢铁焦钢材上半年计划超额完成  造纸企业上半年多产两万多吨纸和纸板

    钢铁工业管理局四种主要产品
    钢铁焦钢材上半年计划超额完成
    造纸企业上半年多产两万多吨纸和纸板
    新华社6日讯　冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业所生产的冶金焦、生铁、钢和钢材四种主要产品都超额完成了上半年国家生产计划，同时也完成了全年增产节约计划中上半年应完成部分。上半年四种主要产品比计划超产的情况是：冶金焦超产约三万吨，生铁超产约三万三千吨，钢超产约四万三千吨，钢材超产约九万五千吨，比去年同期分别增长了13％到73.7％。
    这个局所属各企业在节约原材料、节约金属和降低成本的前提下，各专业生产方面上半年都取得了不少新的成就。炼焦方面，太原钢铁厂利用本地区资源进行炼焦试验已经成功，焦炭质量合乎要求，这样，便合理地利用了资源，加之由于节省运输费用和提高洗煤回收率，全年共可节约四十万多元。炼铁方面，各企业高炉在铁矿石品位继续下降的情况下，想出了许多办法（如提高人造富矿使用量，提高风温等），仍然作到了增产。炼钢方面，各厂克服了废钢供应不足的困难，平炉、电炉和转炉生产都能少用废钢，提高了生铁配用量，并相应地采取了许多措施，保证了钢的质量。由于各厂改进操作，减少了废品量和降低了熔炼损耗，上半年仅平炉和转炉就节约了钢铁料约一万一千吨。轧钢方面，各企业普遍地推行了按负公差轧制钢材的经验，初步统计，上半年因此而节约的金属已经为国家增产了约一万二千吨钢材。此外，各企业还试制成功了许多种新产品，满足了国家生产和建设的需要。
    上半年生产中也存在着一些缺点，如有的企业对增产节约中的先进经验推广的不够普遍，生产中的事故仍然不少等。目前这个局正根据上半年生产工作中的经验和教训，组织所属企业继续深入开展增产节约运动，争取更多地超额完成全年生产任务。
    据新华社7日讯　轻工业部直属四十六个造纸企业今年上半年比国家计划多生产了二万二千二百吨纸和纸板，超过计划9％。全部产量比去年上半年增加22％。主要产品如新闻纸、印刷一般书籍的四号凸版纸、印画报的一号胶版纸、卷烟纸、水泥袋纸等，都超过了国家计划。
    原料不足曾经是今年上半年造纸工业增产的极大困难。上半年，各厂职工都想了许多办法开辟原料来源和利用代用原料。各厂还从生产技术上采取措施减少原料消耗，增加生产。由1月到5月，各造纸厂因降低原料消耗共节约了三千五百立方公尺木材和二千三百吨芦苇。
