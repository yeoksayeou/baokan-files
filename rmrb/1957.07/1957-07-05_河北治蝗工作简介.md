Hebei Province has historically suffered severely from locust plagues. The coastal areas of the Bohai Sea and the Yongding River floodplains experience locust plagues almost every two to three years. In 1933, eighty-five counties across the province were affected by flying locusts, truly a locust-dominated world where "flying locusts obscured the sun, and old farmers shed tears of blood in the fields." Which rulers of the past ever led the peasants to eradicate locusts?

Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government could the peasants of Hebei Province eradicate locusts. In the years since liberation, Hebei Province's locust control work can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage was from 1949 to 1951. At that time, there were no large quantities of pesticides and equipment, so the basic approach was to "rely mainly on manual control, supplemented by pesticides and equipment." In 1951, two million people were mobilized in 117 counties across the province, using 4,500 dusters and 700,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder, eradicating both summer and autumn locusts in 5.94 million mu of land. The second stage was from 1952 to 1954. By this time, national industrialization had developed considerably, producing a large number of pesticides and equipment, so the locust control strategy basically shifted to "pesticides and equipment as the main means, supplemented by manual labor," greatly improving the efficiency of locust control. By 1955, the pesticides and equipment supplied by the state could fully meet the needs of locust control, and the locust control work entered the third stage of "pesticides and equipment as the main means, coordinated with mechanization." The Tianjin Civil Aviation Bureau sends aircraft every year to assist in locust control, and domestically produced dusting vehicles have also begun to be used, with "666" powder fully meeting the needs.

This year, locusts have again appeared in large numbers in Hebei Province, with the area affected by summer locusts reaching 5.6 million mu, exceeding any year since liberation. After the locusts appeared, leading personnel and cadres of Party and government organizations at all levels immediately adopted a fighting posture, mobilizing the masses to engage in the locust control campaign. In the process of locust control, the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperatives was fully utilized, achieving simultaneous summer harvesting, summer planting, threshing, and locust control. Currently, all major locust areas in the province have quickly carried out one round of locust control, preventing the locusts from taking flight. Now, all localities are clearing up the remaining locusts.

In the locust control struggle, Hebei Province has established a complete system of forecasting and early warning. This makes it possible to fully control the locust outbreaks and ensure timely eradication.

    河北治蝗工作简介
    河北省历来蝗虫危害严重。渤海沿岸和永定河泛区，几乎每隔两三年就要闹一次蝗灾。1933年，全省有八十五个县发生飞蝗，真是“飞蝗蔽日无色，野老田中泪垂血”的蝗虫世界。历代统治者，有谁领导农民扑灭蝗虫？
    只有在共产党和人民政府的领导下，河北省的农民才能扑灭了蝗虫。解放后几年以来，河北省治蝗工作大致可分为三个阶段。第一阶段是1949年到1951年。当时还没有大量药械，基本上采取了“人工除治为主，药械为辅”的除蝗方针。1951年，在全省一百一十七个县里，动员了两千万个人工，使用喷粉器四千五百架，“六六六”药粉七十万斤，把五百九十四万亩地里的夏、秋蝗都消灭了。第二阶段从1952年到1954年。这时，国家工业化已有相当发展，制造了大量除蝗药械，因而在治蝗中基本上采取了以“药械为主，人工为辅”的方针，除蝗效率有很大提高。1955年，国家供应的药剂和器械已完全可以满足治蝗的需要，治蝗工作进入了“以药械为主，机械化配合”的第三阶段。天津民航局每年都要派出飞机来协助除治蝗虫，国产喷粉车也开始运用，“六六六”粉已完全可以满足需要。
    今年河北省蝗虫又大量发生，全省发生夏蝗面积达五百六十万亩，超过解放后任何一年。蝗虫发生后，各地党和政府的领导人员和干部，立即以战斗的姿态发动群众投入治蝗运动。在除蝗过程中，充分发挥了高级合作化的优越性，做到一面夏收、夏播、打场，一面除治蝗虫。目前全省各主要蝗区，已迅速把蝗虫除治了一遍，使蝗虫不至起飞。现在各地正在扫清残蝗。
    在除蝗斗争中，河北省建立了一套完整的预测预报制度。这样就完全可以控制蝗虫发生情况，做到及时歼灭。
