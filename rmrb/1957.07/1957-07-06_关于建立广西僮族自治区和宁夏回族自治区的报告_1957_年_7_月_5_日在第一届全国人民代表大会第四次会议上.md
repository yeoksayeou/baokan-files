Report on the Establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
Delivered on July 5, 1957, at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress
Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission

Fellow Deputies:

The State Council, based on the decision of the 51st plenary meeting of the State Council on June 7th of this year, has submitted proposals for the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region for your deliberation. Now, on behalf of the State Council, I will report to the congress on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

The Zhuang ethnic group in Guangxi is the most populous minority ethnic group in our country, with a population of over six million five hundred thousand. In December 1952, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established in Guangxi Province, consisting of 42 counties in the Yishan, Baise, and Yongning special districts; after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, it was reorganized into an autonomous prefecture in 1956. The Hui ethnic group is a relatively populous minority ethnic group in our country, with a population of over three million five hundred thousand, scattered throughout the country, with over one million one hundred thousand residing in Gansu Province. Since 1952, Gansu and other provinces have successively established some Hui autonomous regions equivalent to special districts and counties; after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, they were reorganized or rebuilt into four Hui autonomous prefectures and ten Hui autonomous counties in 1956. It should be said that, as with all minority ethnic groups in the country, the work of implementing ethnic regional autonomy in Zhuang and Hui ethnic areas has been successful. However, based on the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy throughout the country and the situations of the Zhuang and Hui ethnic groups, the Zhuang and Hui ethnic groups must each establish an autonomous region at the provincial level to be commensurate with their position in the big family of the motherland.

According to the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, since May of last year, the CPC committees and people's committees of Guangxi and Gansu provinces, as well as consultative bodies, have repeatedly discussed the establishment of Zhuang and Hui autonomous regions; the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also held a special meeting for full consultation.

During the discussions and consultations, everyone focused on studying various plans for the establishment of autonomous regions for the Zhuang and Hui ethnic groups. There were two main plans for establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region: one plan was to reorganize the entire Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which everyone called the "merging plan"; the other plan was to divide Guangxi into two parts, that is, to retain the establishment of Guangxi Province, governing the eastern region of present-day Guangxi Province, and separately delineate the western region of present-day Guangxi Province, where the Zhuang people are the main minority ethnic group, to establish the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which everyone called the "dividing plan". Comparing the two plans, the merging plan is more suitable for the current and historical situation of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups in Guangxi. First, from the long-term interests of the common development of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi, there are more Han people than Zhuang people in Guangxi Province, with Han people accounting for 58.4% of the total population, Zhuang people accounting for 36.9%, and other minority ethnic groups accounting for 4.7%; however, the area inhabited by Zhuang people is larger than that inhabited by Han people, with Zhuang people's settlements accounting for about 60% of the province's area, Han people's settlements accounting for about 30%, and other minority ethnic groups' settlements accounting for about 10%. The area inhabited by Han people has better conditions for agricultural development, but the conditions in the Zhuang ethnic area are more favorable for industrial development prospects. This shows that the areas of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi are more suitable for merging than dividing. Merging and helping each other, giving full play to their respective strengths, is conducive to the long-term and common progress and development of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. Furthermore, from the history of Guangxi, the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi are also more suitable for merging than dividing. For a long time, the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups within the territory have braved thorns, worked hard, and jointly created the history of Guangxi; especially in the revolutionary struggles of the past century, the people of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi have always fought together, regardless of each other. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement was launched by the people of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups, and in the subsequent period of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, the people of the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi have been persisting in the revolutionary struggle together. This long-term historical tradition of "joint labor creation and joint revolutionary struggle" among the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and other ethnic groups in Guangxi also shows that the merging plan is in line with the historical development situation. After repeated and in-depth discussions on the two plans, the merging plan was finally selected, which is also the plan submitted to the congress for consideration.

Among the several plans for establishing the Hui Autonomous Region, there were also two main ones: one plan was to establish the Hui Autonomous Region on the basis of the former Ningxia Province area (excluding the Mongolian ethnic area) included in present-day Gansu Province, and then incorporate adjacent areas. The area governed by the autonomous region included the Yinchuan Special District, the Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Longde County and Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County of the Pingliang Special District; the other plan was to also delineate other counties of the Pingliang Special District and individual counties of the Tianshui Special District in addition to the above-mentioned areas to establish the Hui Autonomous Region. These two plans can be said to be basically the same, the only difference being whether or not to delineate other counties of the Pingliang Special District and individual counties of the Tianshui Special District. After full discussion, everyone unanimously selected the former plan, which is also the plan submitted to the congress for consideration. In the area included in this plan, Hui people account for one-third, and Han people account for two-thirds, which is conducive to mutual support and common development between the Hui and Han ethnic groups. The economic development conditions in the area included in this plan are also good. In terms of agriculture, the water conservancy in Yinchuan and Wuzhong has always been relatively developed. At present, these two areas have more than three million mu of paddy fields. If the Qingtongxia Dam is built in the future, the irrigated area can be expanded by several million mu; the above-mentioned areas and the Guyuan area also have vast grass mountains and grasslands, which can greatly develop the animal husbandry economy. In terms of mineral resources, the Shizuishan coal mine in Yinchuan has large reserves and has already been mined. According to the materials explored by the geological department, there may also be oil mines in Guyuan, Haiyuan, and other counties. Therefore, the conditions for establishing some new industrial enterprises in the future are also available. In terms of transportation, in addition to the existing highways, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will be completed next year. In the future, the railway from Xianyang in Shaanxi to Wuwei in Gansu is also planned to pass through Guyuan County and Zhongwei County, so the development prospects of the autonomous region's transportation industry are very good. According to the land area and production conditions of the area included in this plan, it can be considered, based on the principle of voluntariness, to gradually move some Hui people from the interior to the autonomous region. This will be a better way to promote the development of the autonomous region and solve the production and livelihood problems of scattered Hui people. The latter plan also has its advantages, but because it involves delineating other counties of the Pingliang Special District and individual counties of the Tianshui Special District, the issues involved are more complicated. In the history of other counties of the Pingliang Special District, due to the instigation of the ruling class, the relationship between the Hui and Han ethnic groups has always been very bad. After liberation, although there has been a fundamental improvement, it will still take a long time to eliminate the estrangement. In view of this situation in ethnic relations, the relevant personnel from all parties unanimously disagreed with using this plan during the discussion and consultation.

After discussions and consultations by all parties, the State Council made a decision on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region at its 51st plenary meeting on June 7th of this year, based on the reports of the People's Committees of Guangxi Province and Gansu Province.

The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a major event in our country's political life. It requires that both the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Hui Autonomous Region be consistent in name and reality and that the solidarity of all parties, especially the solidarity between the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups and the Han and Hui ethnic groups, be guaranteed. This requires making full preparations in all aspects. After this congress approves the proposal on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the proposal on the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, it should continue to conduct full and repeated consultations on the specific issues of establishing the two autonomous regions, conduct extensive publicity among the local people, and make various necessary practical preparations to lay a good foundation for the establishment of the two autonomous regions and the development of future work.

The Zhuang and Hui ethnic groups are two of the more developed minority ethnic groups in our country; now the socialist transformation cause in the two ethnic groups has achieved a decisive victory, a large number of party and non-party cadres have grown up, and there are also experienced Communist Party leaders. It is believed that after the establishment of the autonomous regions, the political, economic, and cultural development of the two ethnic groups will be further developed.

The preparations for the establishment of these two ethnic autonomous regions fully demonstrate that the Party and the government are determined and unwavering in implementing the policy of ethnic regional autonomy.

Ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy adopted by our country to solve the ethnic problems of our country, based on the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and the actual conditions of China. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, we have adopted this basic policy. Our country is a country that has been oppressed by imperialism for a long time, and it has developed and grown up from the anti-colonialist struggle and the national independence movement, and is still threatened and destroyed by imperialism. For this reason, it is very obvious that it is beneficial for all ethnic groups in our country to unite, and it is harmful for them to separate. At the same time, although the minority ethnic groups in the country account for only about 6% of the total population of the country, the areas they inhabit account for about 60% of the total area of the country. The Han ethnic area has a large population, and the minority ethnic area has vast land and abundant resources. This requires close cooperation and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups to give full play to the advantages of the country's vast territory and seek common progress and development. This situation further demonstrates the necessity of unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups in our country. It should also be seen that in a long historical period, all ethnic groups in our country have developed economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other, and jointly created the history and culture of our country; although there was a system of ethnic oppression, the ties between the people of all ethnic groups in our country have continued to develop. The long-term mutual connection and close tradition between the people of all ethnic groups in our country further demonstrates that the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in our country has a long historical foundation.

Our country's adoption of the ethnic regional autonomy policy has won the support of all ethnic groups in the country. They all understand that only by uniting within the big family of all ethnic groups in our country—the People's Republic of China—can we resist imperialist aggression and threats, and can we promote the common progress and development of all ethnic groups.

Our country's work in promoting ethnic regional autonomy has achieved great success. As of now, two autonomous regions, one autonomous region preparatory committee, thirty-one autonomous prefectures, and fifty-four autonomous counties have been established. Thirty-one minority ethnic groups, with a total population of about 23 million, have established autonomous regions, accounting for about 90% of the minority ethnic groups in the country who are eligible to establish autonomous regions and live in concentrated communities. With the implementation of the ethnic regional autonomy policy, 340,000 cadres of various types from minority ethnic groups have been trained.

Due to the thorough implementation of the ethnic regional autonomy policy by the Party and the government, democratic reforms and socialist transformations have been carried out in most autonomous regions, and the social landscape of most minority ethnic areas has undergone historical and profound changes. In the situation of the national socialist transformation upsurge in 1955 and 1956, the vast majority of minority ethnic groups in our country joined the great movement of socialist revolution together with the Han ethnic group. At present, among the 35 million minority ethnic groups in the country, the areas with a population of 30 million have basically completed the socialist transformation in terms of the ownership of the means of production; the areas with a population of about 3 million are undergoing democratic reforms; and the areas with a population of only 2 million have not yet undergone democratic reforms. That is to say, in more than 85% of the minority ethnic areas in our country, the minority ethnic farmers, serfs, and slaves who have been oppressed and suffered for thousands of years have abolished various old systems and begun to enter socialist society.

At the time when the vast majority of minority ethnic groups in our country began to enter socialist society, the economy and culture of the minority ethnic areas have also greatly developed. According to preliminary statistics, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, and the national ethnic autonomous prefectures in 1956 was 5,787,166,600 yuan, which was 158.9% of that in 1952. Among them, the total industrial output value was 1,098,765,500 yuan, which was 356.7% of that in 1952 and 965.2% of that in the early days of liberation; the output value of agricultural and sideline industries was 4,166,671,800 yuan, which was 122% of that in 1952 and 209.3% of that in the early days of liberation; the total number of livestock in pastoral areas was 85,205,000, which was 145.9% of that in 1952 and 183.1% of that in the early days of liberation. In the above-mentioned areas, there were 5,486 university students, 275,859 middle school students, and 3,717,075 elementary school students in 1956, with a total number of students being 132.3% of that in 1952. In the above-mentioned areas, there were 5,080 physicians in 1956, which was 320.1% of that in 1952, and 13,848 hospital beds, which was 183.2% of that in 1952. In addition to the above-mentioned areas, the economy and culture of other minority ethnic areas have also developed to varying degrees.

There is no doubt that the achievements our country has made in solving ethnic problems are very great. This is a glorious victory for the ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Of course, we are not without shortcomings and mistakes in our ethnic work. For example, some autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous organs have not been fully realized; there are still situations where the ethnic equality rights of mixed and scattered minority ethnic groups are not respected; in socialist transformation and socialist construction, the characteristics and needs of minority ethnic groups are not adequately taken into account, etc. At the same time, there are still Han chauvinism and local nationalism in ethnic relations. Many shortcomings and errors in our work are inseparable from the above-mentioned nationalism. In order to criticize the ideology of Han chauvinism and local nationalism and to overcome various shortcomings and errors in our work, the relevant regions have carried out inspections of the implementation of ethnic policies since the summer of last year, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. After this inspection, cadres were educated, work was improved, and the ethnic relations in most minority ethnic areas have been greatly improved compared with before. However, in some places, Han chauvinism and local nationalism still exist seriously and must continue to be overcome.

Although there have been and still are some shortcomings and errors in ethnic work, they are only isolated cases in the entire work. In the face of ironclad facts, no one can deny the correct estimate that achievements are fundamental in solving ethnic problems.

Based on the facts they have personally experienced, the people of all minority ethnic groups in our country have clearly seen that the Communist Party of China is a party that truly and wholeheartedly serves the people of all ethnic groups, and is a party that truly adheres to the principle of ethnic equality and seeks the well-being of the people of minority ethnic groups. Only this party has brought ethnic equality and ethnic regional autonomy to all ethnic groups in our country. Only this party has helped all ethnic groups in our country to form an unprecedented great unity, making our country a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups. Only this party can enable all ethnic groups in our country to achieve great development in politics, economy, and culture, enabling those backward ethnic groups to surpass one or even several stages of development and enter a happy socialist society. It can be imagined that without the Communist Party, the people of minority ethnic groups would not be able to obtain all this, and would continue to live a miserable life of cattle and horses under the dual oppression of ethnicity and class, as in the old society. Due to such a clear contrast of facts, the people of minority ethnic groups in our country, together with the people of the whole country, have expressed boundless indignation at the recent frenzied attack on socialism by bourgeois rightists, and have carried out and are carrying out resolute counterattacks from all aspects. This is completely understandable. The people of minority ethnic groups have also paid special attention to the conspiracy of bourgeois rightists to oppose the Party's ethnic policies. The rightists spread fallacies on ethnic issues, stirred up troubles, deliberately exaggerated the shortcomings in ethnic work, opposed the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policy under various pretexts, and some even repeated the reactionary views of the Kuomintang reactionaries, completely denying the existence of minority ethnic groups. The purpose of the bourgeois rightists in opposing the Party's ethnic policies is to separate the people of minority ethnic groups from the leadership of the Communist Party, to attempt to change the ethnic relations in our country according to their bourgeois image, that is, to attempt to restore the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation among all ethnic groups in our country to the capitalist ethnic relations of mutual oppression and discrimination among all ethnic groups. It must be warned to the bourgeois rightists that the people of all ethnic groups are determined to take the socialist road, and are also determined to safeguard and develop socialist ethnic relations. Therefore, all your conspiracies to oppose the socialist system, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and oppose the Party's ethnic policies are destined to be completely shattered under the resolute counterattack of the people of all ethnic groups.

We firmly believe that the people of all minority ethnic groups will, in the struggle against bourgeois rightists, unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao together with the people of the whole country, and advance more bravely along the broad road of socialism.

    关于建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的报告
    1957年7月5日在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上
    国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任　乌兰夫各位代表：
    国务院根据今年6月7日国务院第五十一次全体会议的决定，提出了建立广西僮族自治区的议案和建立宁夏回族自治区的议案，请大会审议。现在，我代表国务院就关于建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区问题向大会作报告。
    广西僮族是我国人口最多的一个少数民族，约有六百五十多万人口。广西省在1952年12月以宜山、百色、邕宁三个专区共四十二个县的地区，成立了桂西僮族自治区；中华人民共和国宪法颁布以后，在1956年改制为自治州。回族是我国人口较多的一个少数民族，约有三百五十多万人口，分散居住在全国各地，其中居住在甘肃省的有一百一十多万人。甘肃等省自1952年以来先后建立了一些相当于专区和相当于县的回族自治区；中华人民共和国宪法颁布后，在1956年改制或者改建为四个回族自治州、十个回族自治县。应该说，同在全国各少数民族中一样，在僮族和回族聚居区推行民族区域自治的工作是有成绩的。但是，从全国民族区域自治实施的情况和僮族、回族的情况来看，僮族和回族必须分别建立一个省一级的自治地方，才能同他们在祖国大家庭中的地位相适应。
    根据中共中央的倡议，自从去年5月以来，广西省和甘肃省的中共党委和人民委员会以及协商机关先后反复地讨论了建立僮族自治区和回族自治区问题；中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会也召开专门的会议进行了充分的协商。
    在讨论协商中，大家集中研究了僮族和回族建立自治区的各种方案。建立僮族自治区的方案主要的有二个：一个方案是把广西全省改建为僮族自治区，大家把这个方案称为“合的方案”；另一个方案是把广西划分为两个部分，即保留广西省的建制，管辖现在广西省的东部地区，另把现在广西省西部僮人为主的少数民族聚居地区划出来建立僮族自治区，大家把这后一个方案称为“分的方案”。两个方案相比较，合的方案是更适宜于广西汉、僮民族的现实和历史情况的。首先从广西汉、僮民族及其他民族共同向前发展的长远利益来看，广西省的汉人比僮人多，汉人占总人口的58.4％，僮人占36.9％，其他少数民族占4.7％；但居住的面积僮人比汉人的大，僮人聚居地区约占全省面积的60％，汉人聚居地区约占30％，其他少数民族聚居地区约占10％。汉人聚居地区对于农业的发展说来，是条件较好的地区，但是从工业发展前途说，僮族地区的条件又比较优越。这就表明，广西汉、僮两民族和其他民族的地区是宜合不宜分的。合起来互相帮助，各施所长，就有利于广西各民族长远的、共同的进步和发展。再从广西的历史上看，广西汉、僮民族和其他各民族也是宜合不宜分的。长期以来，汉、僮两民族和境内的其他民族披荆斩棘，艰苦劳动，共同创造了广西的历史；特别是近百年来的革命斗争中，广西汉、僮两族人民和其他民族人民一直是不分彼此、共同奋斗的。太平天国运动是汉、僮两族人民发动的，在以后的民主革命时期和社会主义革命时期，广西汉、僮两族人民和其他民族人民都在一起坚持革命斗争。广西汉、僮两民族和其他民族间这种长期“共同劳动创造、共同革命斗争”的历史传统，也正说明合的方案是符合于历史发展情况的。两个方案经过大家反复、深入地讨论后，最后选择了合的方案，也就是现在提交大会议案中的方案。
    在建立回族自治区的好几个方案中，主要的也是二个：一个方案是以现在甘肃省所包括的原宁夏省地区（蒙古族地区不在内）为基础，再划入邻近的地区，建立回族自治区，自治区管辖的地区包括银川专区、吴忠回族自治州、固原回族自治州和平凉专区的隆德县、泾源回族自治县；另一个方案是除上述地区外，并且把平凉专区的其他各县和天水专区的个别县也一齐划出，建立回族自治区。这两个方案可以说基本上是相同的，唯一不同的地方只是划不划平凉专区的其他各县和天水专区的个别县的问题。经过大家充分讨论后，一致选定了前一种方案，也就是现在提交大会议案中的方案。这个方案所包括的地区，回人占三分之一，汉人占三分之二，有利于回、汉民族互相支援和共同发展。这个方案所包括地区的经济发展条件也是良好的。在农业方面，银川、吴忠的水利向来是比较发展的。现在这两个地区有水田三百余万亩，如果将来青铜峡水坝建成后，还可扩大灌溉面积几百万亩；上述地区和固原一带还有广阔的草山和草场，可以大量地发展畜牧业经济。在矿藏方面，银川的石咀山煤矿蕴藏量很大，并且已经开采。根据地质部门勘探的材料，固原、海原等县还可能有石油矿，因此，将来兴办一些新的工业企业的条件也是具备的。在交通方面，除现有的公路外，包兰铁路明年即将修通，将来从陕西咸阳到甘肃武威的铁路，也计划经过固原县和中卫县，所以自治区的交通事业的发展前景是很好的。根据这个方案所包括地区的土地面积和发展生产的条件，可以考虑根据自愿的原则，逐步地把内地的一些能够迁移的回民移到自治区去，这对于促进自治区的发展和解决散居回民的生产、生活问题，将是一个较好的办法。后一种方案也有它的好处，但是因为要划进平凉专区的其他各县和天水专区的个别县，涉及的问题就比较复杂。平凉专区的其他各县在历史上由于统治阶级的挑拨，回、汉民族之间的关系一直是很不好的。解放以后，虽然有了根本的改善，但是要消除隔阂，还需要一个较长的时间。鉴于民族关系方面的这种情况，所以在讨论协商中，各方面的有关人员一致不同意选用这一方案。
    经过各方面的讨论和协商后，国务院根据广西省和甘肃省人民委员会的报告，在今年6月7日第五十一次全体会议上作出了关于成立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的决定。
    建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区是我国政治生活中的一件大事，要求做到既能实现名实相符的僮族自治区和回族自治区，又能保证巩固各方面的团结，特别是汉、僮民族间的团结和汉、回民族间的团结，这就需要在各方面做好充分的准备工作。在这次大会批准关于建立广西僮族自治区的议案和关于建立宁夏回族自治区的议案后，应该继续就建立两个自治区的各项具体问题进行充分的和反复的协商，在当地人民中进行广泛的宣传，并且做好各种必要的实际准备，为两个自治区的成立和往后的工作发展打下良好的基础。
    僮族和回族是我国发展水平比较高的两个少数民族；现在两个民族中的社会主义改造事业已经取得了决定性的胜利，大批党与非党的干部已经成长起来，并且都有了经过锻炼的共产党的领导人员。相信自治区建立后，两个民族的政治、经济、文化必将得到进一步的发展。
    这两个民族自治区的准备建立，充分说明党和政府对于民族区域自治政策的贯彻实行是坚决的、始终不渝的。
    民族区域自治是我国根据马克思列宁主义的一般原理和中国的实际情况而采取的解决我国民族问题的基本政策。自从中华人民共和国建立的时候起，我们就采取了这个基本政策。我国是长期被帝国主义压迫的国家，是从反殖民主义的斗争中、从民族独立运动中发展成长起来的，并且现在还受着帝国主义的威胁和破坏。由于这个原因，我国各民族合则两利，分则 两害，这是很明显的。同时，全国少数民族人口虽然只占全国总人口的6％左右，但他们所居住的地区却占全国总面积的60％左右，汉族地区人口众多，少数民族地区地大物博，这正需要各民族亲密合作，互相帮助，以便充分发挥国家幅员广大的好处，而求得共同的进步和发展。这方面的情况，益加表明我国各民族团结合作的必要性。还应该看到，在很长的历史时期中，我国各民族互相间发展了经济上的合作和文化上的交流，共同创造了我国的历史和文化；虽然存在过民族压迫制度，但是我国各民族人民间的联系还是得到了不断的发展的。我国各民族人民间这个长期互相联系和接近的传统，更表明我国各民族的团结合作是有其悠久的历史基础的。
    我国采取民族区域自治政策，取得了国内各民族的支持。他们都懂得，只有团结在我国各民族的大家庭——中华人民共和国之内，才能抵抗帝国主义的侵略和威胁，也才能促进各民族共同的进步和发展。
    我国推行民族区域自治的工作已经取得了巨大的成就。截至目前为止，已经建立了两个自治区，一个自治区筹备委员会，三十一个自治州，五十四个自治县。建立自治地方的已经有三十一个少数民族，共约二千三百万人口，占全国有条件建立自治地方、聚居的少数民族人口的90％左右。随着民族区域自治政策的推行，已经培养了少数民族的各种干部三十四万人。
    由于党和政府彻底地实行了民族区域自治政策，在大多数自治地方实行了民主改革和社会主义改造，大部分少数民族地区的社会面貌已经发生了历史性的深刻变化。在1955年到1956年的全国社会主义改造高潮的形势下，我国绝大部分少数民族和汉族一起进入了社会主义革命的伟大运动。现在，在全国三千五百万少数民族中，有三千万人口的地区已经在生产资料所有制方面基本完成了社会主义改造；约有三百万人口的地区正在进行民主改革；只有二百万人口的地区还未进行民主改革。这就是说，在我国85％以上的少数民族地区，千百年来受压迫、受痛苦的少数民族农民、农奴和奴隶，已经废除了各种旧制度，开始进入了社会主义社会。
    在我国绝大部分少数民族开始进入社会主义社会的时候，少数民族地区的经济和文化也有了很大的发展。根据初步统计，内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、青海省和全国各民族自治州，1956年的工农业总产值是五十七亿八千七百一十六万六千元，为1952年的158.9％。其中工业总产值是十亿九千八百七十六万五千元，为1952年的356.7％，为解放初期的965.2％；农副业产值四十一亿六千六百七十一万八千元，为1952年的122％，为解放初期的209.3％；牧业区牲畜总头数是八千五百二十万五千头，为1952年的145.9％，为解放初期的183.1％。在上述地区内，1956年有大学生五千四百八十六人，中学生二十七万五千八百五十九人，小学生三百七十一万七千零七十五人，学生总数为1952年的132.3％。在上述地区内，1956年有医师五千零八十人，为1952年的320.1％，病床一万三千八百四十八张，为1952年的183.2％。除上述地区外，其他各少数民族地区的经济和文化也都有不同程度的发展。
    毫无疑问，我国在解决民族问题方面所取得的成绩是十分伟大的，这是中国共产党和毛泽东主席民族政策的光辉胜利。
    当然，我们在民族工作中不是没有缺点和错误的。例如民族自治机关的有些自治权利还没有充分实现；杂居和散居少数民族的民族平等权利还有不被尊重的情况；在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，对少数民族的特点和需要也还照顾不够等。与此同时，在民族关系中还存在有大汉族主义和地方民族主义，我们工作中的许多缺点和错误是和上述的民族主义分不开的。为了批判大民族主义和地方民族主义的思想，和克服工作中的各种缺点、错误，根据中共中央的指示，各有关地区从去年夏季开始，进行了民族政策执行情况的检查。经过这次检查，教育了干部，改进了工作，使大多数少数民族地区的民族关系比较从前大有改进。但是，在一部分地方，大汉族主义和地方民族主义还严重的存在，必须继续加以克服。
    虽然民族工作中曾经有过并且现在还有一些缺点和错误，但它在全部工作中，只是个别的情况，在铁的事实面前，谁也无法否认在解决民族问题方面成绩是基本的这个正确的估计。
    我国各少数民族人民根据自己亲身感受的事实，看清楚了中国共产党是一个真正全心全意为各族人民服务的政党，是一个真正坚持民族平等原则和给少数民族人民谋福利的政党。只有这个党，才给我国各民族带来了民族平等和民族区域自治。只有这个党，才帮助我国各民族形成空前的大团结，使我国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。只有这个党，才能够使我国各民族在政治、经济和文化方面获得巨大的发展，使那些落后的民族超越了一个甚至几个发展阶段，进入了幸福的社会主义社会。可以设想，如果没有共产党，少数民族人民就得不到这一切，就会和在旧社会一样，在民族的和阶级的双重压迫下，继续过那悲惨的牛马生活。由于这样显明的事实对比，我国的少数民族人民和全国人民一道，对于最近一个时期资产阶级右派分子向社会主义的疯狂进攻，表示了无比的愤慨，并且从各方面进行了和正在进行着坚决的反击，这是完全可以理解的。少数民族人民还特别注意了资产阶级右派分子反对党的民族政策的阴谋。右派分子在民族问题方面散布谬论，挑拨是非，故意扩大民族工作中的缺点，以各种借口反对党的民族区域自治政策，有的甚至重复国民党反动派的反动观点，根本否认少数民族的存在。资产阶级右派分子反对党的民族政策的目的，是要少数民族人民脱离共产党的领导，是要企图按照他们资产阶级的面貌来改变我国的民族关系，也就是企图把我国现在各民族间平等、团结、友爱、合作的社会主义的民族关系恢复为各民族间互相压迫和歧视的资本主义的民族关系。必须警告资产阶级右派分子，各民族人民是要坚定地走社会主义道路的，也是要坚定地维护和发展社会主义的民族关系的，因而你们反对社会主义制度，反对共产党的领导和反对党的民族政策的一切阴谋，注定要在各民族人民的坚决反击下遭到彻底的粉碎。
    我们坚信，各少数民族人民在反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，必然会同全国人民一道，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，更加奋勇地沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进。（附图片）
