    Rapid Development of Local Industry in Yunnan
    More Than Two Hundred New Factories and Mines Built Last Year

    (Our newspaper reports) The Industry Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened the first provincial local industry conference. The conference focused on summarizing the experiences and lessons of local industry in implementing the first Five-Year Plan, and determined the future direction of local industrial development.

    Last year, Yunnan's local industry developed significantly. To date, there are more than one thousand local industrial factories and mines throughout the province. Among them, 235 factories and mines were newly built in 1956. The total industrial output value was more than 190 million yuan in 1955, and reached more than 260 million yuan in 1956. Compared with 1952, the output of major products increased significantly: electricity was 346% of the 1952 level, coal was 756%, rice threshers were 920%, cotton cloth was 535%, and other products such as pig iron and coke also experienced several hundred-fold increases. Local handicrafts in the province have also developed significantly.

    When constructing and expanding local industrial enterprises, various regions generally paid attention to implementing the policy of relying on the masses to build enterprises diligently and thriftily. For example, Zhaotong Prefecture only had three dilapidated enterprises in the early days of liberation. They adopted methods such as raising funds independently and clearing out existing resources, and by 1955 had established 39 factories and mines. Now, including enterprises built with state allocations, the entire prefecture has 95 factories and mines. However, some regions lacked serious investigation and research into economic conditions such as resources and sales, resulting in some enterprises developing blindly, which caused some losses.

    After comprehensively studying the situation of local industry in Yunnan, the conference determined the future direction and development path of local industrial development. In the future, Yunnan's local industry will focus on developing the food industry and daily necessities industry, and will also pay attention to developing the processing of agricultural specialty products and the local mining and smelting of non-ferrous metals needed by the state. The conference believes that industrial development in special counties should have its own characteristics, and that the integration of production, supply, and sales should be fully considered. The development of industry and handicrafts in ethnic minority areas must fully consider ethnic characteristics. The conference also called for strengthening investigation and research to understand market conditions and resource situations, in order to give full play to enthusiasm while avoiding blindness.

    The conference also discussed in detail how to further carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in local industry. The conference also emphasized that party leadership over local industry must be strengthened in all aspects.

    云南地方工业迅速发展
    去年新建二百多个厂矿
    本报讯　中共云南省委工业部最近召开了全省第一次地方工业会议。会议着重总结地方工业在执行第一个五年计划中的经验和教训，确定今后地方工业发展方针。
    去年一年，云南省地方工业有很大发展。到目前止，全省共有一千多个地方工业厂矿。其中1956年新建的厂矿就有二百三十五个。工业总产值1955年为一亿九千多万元，1956年已达二亿六千多万元。主要产品的产量同1952年比较，电力为1952年的346％，煤为756％，打稻机为920％，棉布为535％，其它如生铁、焦炭等，也都有数百倍的增长。全省地方手工业也有很大发展。
    各地在新建和扩建地方工业企业的时候，一般都注意贯彻了依靠群众勤俭办企业的方针。例如，昭通专区在解放初期只有三个破烂不堪的企业，他们采取自筹经费、清理家底等办法，到1955年已经办起了三十九个厂矿。现在连国家拨款兴建的企业，全区已经有九十五个厂矿。但是，有些地区由于对资源、销路等经济条件缺乏认真的调查研究，部分企业的发展带有盲目性，这也造成了一些损失。
    会议在全面研究了云南地方工业的状况以后，确定了今后地方工业的发展方针和发展道路。今后，云南省地方工业将以食品工业和日用百货工业为发展重点，并注意发展国家需要的农特产品加工工业和有色金属的土采土炼。会议认为专县工业应有自己的特点，并要全面地考虑产供销的结合问题。少数民族地区的工业和手工业的发展，必须充分注意民族特点。会议还要求加强调查研究，摸清市场情况和资源情况，一方面要发挥积极性，同时要避免盲目性。
    会议还详细讨论了在地方工业中如何进一步开展增产节约运动的问题。会议还强调指出，必须从各个方面加强党对地方工业的领导。
