Fisheries Anecdotes

	Rabbit-Eared Fish
	In late June, fishing boats of the Shanghai Ocean Fisheries Company caught a large, strange fish in the Yellow Sea. It weighed about 800 pounds and had pectoral fins like wings, a body like a bat, and two fins on its head that resembled rabbit ears. It had two spiracles on its back, bright, piercing eyes, and a mouth that, when opened, was three feet in diameter. No teeth were visible, but its mouth corners were filled with densely packed small yellow croaker.
	According to Zhu Yuanding, an old professor at the Shanghai Fisheries College Research Office, this fish is called a manta ray, living in the tropical Indian Ocean and Australian waters. It is viviparous, giving birth to only one offspring at a time, and rarely swims to the Yellow Sea. When hunting, this fish first uses its pectoral fins to stun plankton, then uses its cephalic fins to roll them into its mouth and swallow them, consuming hundreds at a time. Its skin can be used for leather making, and its meat can be made into fish meal.
	
	Odd-Shaped Giant Tiger Fish
	A strange fish weighing over 1,500 pounds was recently caught in the Dongtou fishing grounds. This fish had a rectangular body, more than ten feet long and wide. Its mouth was over two feet wide, its head had two soft horns more than one foot long, and its tail had a two-foot-long tail fin. According to veteran fishermen, this fish is an odd-shaped giant tiger fish.
	Members of the Nantang First Fishery Cooperative in Dongtou County caught this strange fish and transported it to Wenzhou City, where many people went to see it.
	
	Long-Winged Flying Fish
	Members of the Tantou Fishery Cooperative in Xiangshan County caught a long-winged flying fish in the East China Sea. This fish was about one foot long, weighed over ten taels, and had two wings over one foot long growing on both sides of its head. Two inches from its tail, there were two smaller wings, each two inches long. Its head was black, and its wings were white.
	
	Yellow Croaker "King"
	During this year's large yellow croaker season, fishermen along the coast of Zhejiang Province successively caught three yellow croaker "kings." The largest weighed 125 pounds, was over five feet long, and had scales as large as silver dollars. The other two weighed 71 pounds and 64 pounds, respectively. These yellow croaker "kings" each had several pounds of yellow maw inside, which is a valuable tonic. Veteran fishermen say that yellow croaker of this size were rarely seen in the past.
	
	Thousand-Pound Sea Turtle
	Fishermen in Hongyu Township, Rudong County, Jiangsu Province recently caught a thousand-pound leatherback sea turtle in the sea. This animal was six feet long, one and a half feet high, and three feet wide. Its head resembled a turtle's, its tail resembled a swallow's tail, its front two feet were like bird wings, and it had seven ridges on its back. It could carry four people on its back and crawl. Leatherback sea turtles are found in tropical seas, more commonly in India and Ceylon, and also appear on the coasts of China and Japan during hot weather.　·Xinhua News Agency·

    渔业珍闻
    兔耳朵鱼
    6月下旬，上海海洋渔业公司的渔轮在黄海捕获了一条大怪鱼。它约有八百斤重，有两只翅膀的胸鳍，全身像蝙蝠，头上还有两个似兔耳朵的鳍，背上有两个喷水孔，大眼睛炯炯有光，嘴巴张开直径达三尺，看不到有牙齿，但口角里有密密麻麻的小黄鱼。
    据上海水产学院研究室的老教授朱元鼎说，这种鱼叫前口蝠鲼，生活在热带的印度洋和澳洲等海洋上，是胎生的，每次只生一条，很少游到黄海上来。这种鱼捕食时先用胸鳍把浮游小生物打昏，然后用头鳍卷进嘴里吞食，一次可吞食几百条。它的皮可以制革，肉可以做鱼粉。
      怪形大虎鱼
    一条一千五百多斤重的怪鱼最近在洞头渔场捕获。这条鱼的身体为长方形，长阔各一丈多。鱼嘴有两尺多宽，头部有两只一尺多长的软角，尾部有一条两尺多长的尾巴。据老渔民说，这条鱼是怪形大虎鱼。
    洞头县南塘第一渔业社的社员们捕到这条怪鱼，并把它运到温州市后，许多人前去参观。
    长翅飞鱼
    象山县坦头渔业社的社员在东海面捕到一条长翅飞鱼。这条鱼身长约一尺，体重十多两，头部两旁生长着一尺多长的两张翅膀，离尾巴两寸处又生长着两张两寸长的小翅膀。它的头部乌黑，翅膀带白色。
      黄鱼“王”
    今年大黄鱼汛中，浙江省沿海渔民先后捕捞到三条黄鱼“王”。最大的一条重一百二十五斤，身长五尺多，鳞片有银元那么大。其余两条各重七十一斤和六十四斤。这些黄鱼“王”的肚内都有几斤重的黄胶，是珍贵的补品。老渔民说，像这样大的黄鱼，过去是很少见到的。
    千斤海龟
    江苏省如东县鸿余乡渔民最近在海里捕获一只千斤重的棱皮海龟。这个动物身长六尺，高一尺半，宽三尺，头似乌龟，尾似燕尾，前二足如鸟翅，背上有七条从棱。它可以驮载四个人爬行。棱皮海龟产于热带海中，印度、锡兰较多，在炎热的时候也出现在中国和日本海滨。　·新华社·
