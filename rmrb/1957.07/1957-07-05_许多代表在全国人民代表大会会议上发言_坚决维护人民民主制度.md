Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussion this afternoon.

    The delegates who spoke at the meeting today were Yang Mingxuan, Li Enye, Wang Zhuchen, Huang Zhengqing, Liu Guojun, Yi Shijuan, Yu Yanong, Chen Shaokuan, Li Da, Liu Hongda, Zhang Wenchun, Zhang Zhenfa, Li Yaoxian, Tong Yulan, Wu Fengqi, Zheng Kuifu, and Ye Xichun. Those who submitted written statements were Chen Yinnan, Xu Baoju, Luo Changpei, and Li Youan, totaling twenty-one people. They unanimously agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and other work reports presented to the Congress. They also expressed their opinions on various aspects of the work and the results of their inspections, raising criticisms and suggestions. Many delegates, based on their personal experiences, refuted the various absurd anti-socialist arguments of the bourgeois right-wing elements in their speeches.

    Yang Mingxuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke on the issue of consolidating and developing China's fundamental political system—the People's Congress system. He said that the implementation of the People's Congress system by the central government and various provinces and cities in recent years has been generally good. Meetings are generally held once or several times a year; many major events have been discussed by the People's Congress, and decisions have been made after concentrating opinions, correctly reflecting the unified will of the people; the People's Congress has generally implemented the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, enabling the various tasks of state organs to correct errors, overcome shortcomings, and improve in a timely manner. From the implementation of the People's Congress system over the past few years, it has been proven that this system is a superior political system that conforms to China's nature and is suitable for China's conditions, and is a democratic system supported by the broad masses of the Chinese people. Yang Mingxuan compared the bourgeois formal democracy with socialist democracy, and refuted the bourgeois right-wingers' fallacies about "the Party's world" and their attempts to establish a bicameral system and have various parties take turns governing. He said that in the future, we must consolidate and develop our country's political system, and there should be no doubt or wavering.

    Yang Mingxuan said that there are still shortcomings in the implementation of our system. Last winter, during his inspection in some areas of Guangxi and Guangdong, he found that some counties and townships did not convene meetings on time; some places did not respect the power of the people enough, and some decisions were made subjectively without consulting the masses, and even arbitrarily replaced people's representatives. Yang Mingxuan suggested that leaders at all levels of the Party and government should always pay attention to the implementation of the national political system, summarize experience in a timely manner, and continuously improve and perfect this system. We should pay attention to conducting education in this area for the people and the staff of state organs, and cultivate the people's habit of exercising democracy.

    Li Enye, director of the Coal and Coke Laboratory of the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Comprehensive Research Institute, was extremely excited about the rapid development of China's coking chemical industry production. He said that in 1957, China planned to produce 7.46 million tons of coke, a figure he had never dreamed of before liberation. However, the coking chemical industry was almost blank in old China. He also criticized the shortcomings he saw in his inspection of scientific research work that were not in line with the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and in the aspects of organizational leadership.

    Wang Zhuchen, vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressed his views on the issues of the school system, curriculum, and teaching materials in primary and secondary schools based on his personal experience. He mentioned that primary schools can be changed to a four-year system; foreign language formal courses should not be added to junior high schools, and students should focus on laying a good foundation in Chinese; the old habit of families allowing children to detach themselves from labor as soon as they enter school must be strongly changed, and attention should be paid to cultivating children's labor habits and knowledge skills.

    Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), vice governor of Gansu Province, introduced the rapid development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings in the Gannan area after the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, and the situation of people of all ethnic groups living and working in peace and contentment. He said that the Gannan Tibetan people have always been simple, honest, and clear about what they love and hate. We hate the reactionaries because they made us suffer so much, and we love the Communist Party because the Communist Party brought us light and happiness. Forever following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and taking the road of socialism, this is our firm and unwavering belief. The flowery words of the right-wing elements cannot deceive us.

    Liu Guojun, vice governor of Jiangsu Province, used his own Changzhou Dacheng Textile Printing and Dyeing Company as an example to talk about the policy of redemption and the issue of fixed interest. Liu Guojun said that the fixed interest comes from the capital and the shares obtained after the liquidation and asset verification. It is naturally an exploitation of the parent company. The seven-year fixed interest not only includes all the share capital exploited before liberation, but also contains a large part of the results of the hard work of the working class after liberation.

    Yi Shijuan, a model worker in the Shanghai textile industry, used concrete facts to refute the fallacy of the right-wingers saying "the Communist Party is not democratic." Yi Shijuan said that the right-wingers are spreading rumors everywhere, trying to provoke and undermine the relationship between our workers and the Party. We workers will never be deceived by them. We must heighten our vigilance, closely unite around the Party, support the leadership of the Party, and smash the conspiracies of the right-wingers to fight to the end to complete socialist construction. Her speech aroused a storm of applause from the audience.

    Chen Shaokuan, vice governor of Fujian Province, said that the full operation of the Yingxia Railway has realized the hopes of the people of Fujian for decades. The people of Fujian thank the Party and the government, and also thank the Railway Corps. He mentioned that the current plan for the railway from Nanping to Fuzhou is to only lay rails to Eyang, and he hopes that the government will still find a way to lay rails to Fuzhou according to the original plan. He also suggested that the branch line from Zhangping to Longyan, which is tens of kilometers long, should be built ahead of schedule.

    Li Da, president of Wuhan University, gave a speech entitled "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." In his speech, he criticized the ideological sentiments of the right-wing intellectuals represented by Fei Xiaotong's article "The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals." He said that the central idea of this article is to emphasize that from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to March 1957, it was the winter weather for intellectuals. It seems to say that during this period, Chinese intellectuals lived a "miserable" life, and finally waited for the "suddenly warm but still cold" early spring weather. This is completely contrary to the facts. We all know very well that from the day of the national liberation, it has already been a bright spring for intellectuals, and now it is an "extraordinary spring." Li Da said that Fei Xiaotong's malicious propaganda is motivated by ulterior motives. This article is not a personal lyrical work by Fei Xiaotong, but a propaganda document of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and its publication is the first shot of the right-wing intellectuals' attack on the Party.

    Li Da said that in the struggle against the right-wingers, he deeply felt that if intellectuals sincerely support the Party and socialism, they must continue to strengthen ideological remolding.

    Liu Hongda, a representative from Liaoning Province, along with Zhang Wenchun, Zhang Zhenfa, Li Yaoxian, Tong Yulan, Wu Fengqi, and Zheng Kuifu, seven agricultural labor models, jointly spoke at the meeting today. In their joint speech, he said that recently they saw some strange arguments in the newspaper saying that "cooperativization advanced rashly." They disagreed with this statement. The agricultural cooperatives they are in have all developed normally from small to large, from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. There are also some cooperatives nearby that were established all at once, but they did not collapse, but instead improved production and increased income. They said that since production has increased and income has increased, why do they still say that cooperativization advanced rashly? He said that the right-wing elements pretend to represent the interests of the peasants, which is really overestimating themselves. We peasants know better than anyone else who can represent the interests of the peasants and who brings prosperity to the peasants. Their words were warmly welcomed by the audience with thunderous applause.

    Chen Yinnan, vice governor of Anhui Province, Xu Baoju, member of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, Luo Changpei, director of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Li Youan, an agricultural labor model in Anhui, respectively made written statements today.

    The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Guo Moruo, Chen Jiageng, Tan Zheng, Xie Fumin, Lü Hongbin, Dapusheng, Yan Jici, and Huang Changshui.

    Today's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and ended at 7:10 p.m.

    许多代表在全国人民代表大会会议上发言
    坚决维护人民民主制度
    据新华社4日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。
    今天在大会上发言的代表有杨明轩、李恩业、王祝晨、黄正清、刘国钧、裔式娟、余亚农、陈绍宽、李达、刘洪达、张文春、张振发、李耀先、佟玉兰、吴凤岐、郑奎福、叶熙春，书面发言的有陈荫南、许宝驹、罗常培、李有安，共二十一人。他们一致同意周恩来总理向大会所作的“政府工作报告”及其他各项工作报告，并就各方面的工作和视察结果发表意见，提出了批评和建议。许多代表还根据切身的经历和体会，在发言中驳斥了资产阶级右派分子反社会主义的各种荒谬言论。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员杨明轩，就巩固与发展我国的根本政治制度——人民代表大会制度的问题发言。他说，几年来，中央和各省、市贯彻执行人民代表大会制度的情况基本上是良好的，一般地每年都举行一次或几次会议；很多重大事件都经过人民代表大会的讨论，集中起来作出决定，正确地反映了人民统一的意志；人民代表大会一般还贯彻了批评与自我批评精神，使国家机关的各项工作能够及时地纠正错误，克服缺点，得到改进。从几年来人民代表大会制度贯彻执行的情况来看，证明这个制度是一个符合我国性质、适宜于我国情况的优越的政治制度，是为我国广大人民所拥护的民主制度。杨明轩就资产阶级的形式上的民主与社会主义民主作了比较，批驳了资产阶级右派分子关于“党天下”的谬论和想搞两院制、各党派轮流执政的企图。他说，今后我们必须巩固与发展我们国家的政治制度，不许有任何怀疑与动摇。
    杨明轩说，我们的制度在执行中还有缺点，去年冬天他在广西、广东的部分地区视察，发现有些县、乡没有按期召开会议；有的地方对人民群众的权力尊重不够，有些事情不和群众商量便主观的作了决定，甚至随便撤换人民代表。杨明轩建议，党和政府的各级领导要经常重视国家政治制度的贯彻，要及时总结经验，使这一制度不断地改进和健全。对人民群众和国家机关的工作人员，应注意进行这方面的教育，培养人民运用民主的习惯。
    北京钢铁工业综合研究所煤焦室主任李恩业对我国炼焦化学工业生产的高速度发展感到万分兴奋。他说，1957年我国计划生产七百四十六万吨焦炭，这是他在解放以前所梦想不到的数字。而炼焦化学工业在旧中国却几乎是个空白。他还对他在视察中所看到的科学研究工作某些不合于勤俭建国方针和组织领导方面的缺点提出了批评。
    政协山东省委员会副主席王祝晨根据他亲身经验，对中小学的学制、课程和教材等问题发表了意见。他提到小学可以改为四年制；初中不应添设外国语正式课程，应让学生专心致力打好国文基础；儿童一入学，家庭就让他脱离劳动的这种旧习惯必须力改，要注意养成儿童的劳动习惯和知识技能。
    甘肃省副省长黄正清（藏族）介绍了甘南地区实行民族区域自治后在政治、经济、文化事业方面迅速发展，各族人民安居乐业的情况。他说，甘南藏族人民向来是纯朴耿直，爱憎分明的。我们恨反动派，因为反动派给我们吃尽了苦头，我们爱共产党，因为共产党给我们带来了光明和幸福。永远跟着共产党和毛主席，走社会主义的道路，这是我们坚定不移的信念。右派分子的花言巧语是欺骗不了我们的。
    江苏省副省长刘国钧在发言中以他所经营的常州大成纺织印染公司为例，谈到了赎买政策和定息问题。刘国钧说，定息是从资本与清产核资后所取得的股权而来的，是子从母出的，当然是一种剥削。七年定息不仅包括了全部解放前剥削而来的股本，而且还包含着很大一部分解放后工人阶级辛勤劳动的成果。
    上海纺织工业劳动模范裔式娟用具体事实驳斥右派分子说“共产党不民主”的谬论。裔式娟说，右派分子到处造谣，想挑拨破坏我们工人群众同党的关系，我们工人决不会受他们的欺骗，我们要提高警惕，紧密地团结在党的周围，拥护党的领导，击破右派分子的阴谋活动，为完成社会主义建设斗争到底。她的发言激起全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    福建省副省长陈绍宽说，鹰厦铁路的全线通车实现了福建人民数十年来的盼望，福建人民感谢党和政府，也感谢铁道兵部队。他提到，南平到福州的铁路现在计划只铺轨到莪洋，希望政府仍按原计划设法铺轨到福州。他还建议提前兴修漳平到龙岩长几十公里的支路。
    武汉大学校长李达的发言，题为“齐放与争鸣”。他在发言中批判了费孝通写的“知识分子的早春天气”一文所代表的右派知识分子的思想情绪。他说，这篇文章的中心思想是着重表明：从1949年中华人民共和国成立到1957年3月为止，是知识分子的严冬天气。这好像是说，在这段期间内，我国知识分子过着“凄凄惨惨戚戚”的生活，好容易才盼到了“乍暖还寒”的早春天气。这完全是反调。我们都很清楚地知道，从全国解放之日起，已经是知识分子的明朗的春天，现在已经是“不平凡的春天”了。李达说，费孝通的恶意宣传是别有用心的。这篇文章，不是费孝通个人抒情之作，而是章罗同盟的一个宣传文件，它的发表是右派知识分子向党进攻的第一炮。
    李达说，在反右派的斗争中，深切地感到，知识分子如果真心拥护党，拥护社会主义，就必须继续加强思想改造。
    来自辽宁省的刘洪达代表他自己和张文春、张振发、李耀先、佟玉兰、吴凤岐、郑奎福等七位农业劳动模范，今天在会上联合发言。他在联合发言中说，最近在报上看到了一些奇怪的议论，说“合作化冒进了”。他们不同意这种说法。他们所在的农业社都是由小到大、由初级社到高级社正常发展起来的。附近也有的社是一下子办起来的，但是它们并没搞垮，而是提高了生产，增加了收入。他们说，既然生产提高了，收入增加了，为什么还说合作化冒进了呢？他说，右派分子装成代表农民利益的样子，真是太不自量力了。谁能代表农民的利益，谁给农民带来富裕生活，这个我们农民比谁都清楚。他们的话受到全场热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    安徽省副省长陈荫南、全国人民代表大会法案委员会委员许宝驹、中国科学院语言研究所所长罗常培、安徽农业劳动模范李有安，今天分别作了书面发言。
    今天大会执行主席是：郭沫若、陈嘉庚、谭政、谢扶民、吕鸿宾、达浦生、严济慈、黄长水。
    今天的会议从下午三时开始到七时十分结束。
