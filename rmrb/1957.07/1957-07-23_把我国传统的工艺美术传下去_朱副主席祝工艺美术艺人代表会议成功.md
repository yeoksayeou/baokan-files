    Pass on China's traditional arts and crafts!
    Vice Chairman Zhu wishes the representative meeting of arts and crafts artists a success

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The National Arts and Crafts Artists Representative Meeting opened in Beijing yesterday. A total of 465 representatives attended (some representatives from Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi were unable to arrive due to transportation difficulties). Among the representatives, 339 were veteran artists with outstanding achievements in arts and crafts. These included ceramic and printing artists specializing in the manufacture of daily necessities, as well as embroidery and carving artists skilled in making artistic appreciation items; there were famous artists who mastered unique skills, as well as veteran artists who actively trained apprentices; there were paper flower artists who inherited seven generations of ancestral craftsmanship, as well as Jun porcelain artists who restored lost famous products. They came from the borders of Yunnan, the front lines of Xiamen, the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and the heads of the Changbai Mountains. They included thirteen ethnic groups, including Han, Hui, Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Kazakh, Manchu, Yi, Korean, Buyi, Miao, Sani, and Bai, representing 106 natural industries of arts and crafts. In addition to members of arts and crafts production cooperatives, they also included workers in state-owned factories, workers in joint state-private factories, and individual handicraftsmen.

    The representatives also included art workers and university professors who were good at combining with artists and contributing to the arts and crafts industry, as well as arts and crafts production managers and representatives of relevant agencies.

    The arts and crafts industry, especially folk crafts, was not valued in the old society, and the lives of the artists were very difficult. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invasion, the arts and crafts industry declined day by day, the artists had no means of living, and many were forced to change careers or even become displaced. Many famous arts were also lost. After liberation, the Party adopted a policy of protecting, developing, and improving arts and crafts. Under the attention, care, and support of the Party and the government, the arts and crafts industry has undergone new development, many artists who had changed careers have returned, and many lost famous products have been restored. Over the past eight years, the economic and political lives of the artists have improved significantly. Therefore, the representatives who attended the meeting were very excited and brought their new works to participate in the meeting. In the two large halls on the left and right sides of the venue, 2,388 works brought by the representatives were displayed.

    At the meeting yesterday morning, Bai Rubing, Director of the Central Handicraft Administration and Director of the Preparatory Office of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, gave a report. Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Zhou Guangchun, Deputy Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council, Zheng Zhenduo, Deputy Minister of Culture, and Chu Tunan, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, also attended the meeting.

    In the afternoon, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, received all the representatives and delivered an important speech at the meeting, giving important instructions to the representatives. He wished the meeting a success and congratulated the development of the arts and crafts industry. He encouraged the artists to take more apprentices and pass on China's traditional arts and crafts industry, which has lasted for thousands of years, forever, making it better and better.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De also visited the representatives' works.

    把我国传统的工艺美术传下去
    朱副主席祝工艺美术艺人代表会议成功
    本报讯　全国工艺美术艺人代表会议昨日在北京开幕。到会代表共四百六十五人（甘肃、青海和陕西部分代表因交通受阻未赶到）。代表中间，有在工艺美术方面有卓越成就的老艺人三百三十九人。其中有专门制造生活日用品的陶瓷、印花艺人，也有擅长制作艺术欣赏品的刺绣、雕刻艺人；有掌握绝技的名艺人，也有积极培养徒工的老艺人；有继承七代祖传工艺的纸花艺人，也有恢复失传名产的钧瓷艺人。他们有的来自云南边疆，有的来自厦门前线；有的来自天山南北，有的来自长白山头。他们包括汉、回、蒙古、维吾尔、藏、哈萨克、满、彝、朝鲜、布依、苗、撒尼、白等十三个民族，代表了一百零六个工艺美术自然行业。他们中间除工艺美术生产合作社社员外，还有国营工厂的工人、公私合营工厂的工人和个体手工业者。
    代表中间，还包括善于同艺人结合、对工艺美术事业有贡献的美术工作者和大学教授，也有工艺美术生产管理人员和有关机关代表。
    工艺美术事业，特别是民间工艺，在旧社会是不被重视的，艺人生活也很困苦。特别是在国民党反动统治和日寇侵占的时期，工艺美术事业，日益衰落，艺人生活无着，被迫改行甚至流离失所的不知有多少。许多有名的艺术也就失传了。解放后党对工艺美术采取了保护、发展和提高的方针。在党和政府的重视、关怀和扶植下，工艺美术事业有新的发展，许多过去改了行的艺人归了队，许多失了传的名产也得到恢复。八年来，艺人们的经济生活和政治生活都有了显著的提高。因此，到会的代表都以十分兴奋的心情，带着自己的新作前来参加会议。在会场左右的两个大厅里，就陈设了代表们带来的作品二千三百八十八件。
    在昨天上午的会上，中央手工业管理局局长、中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备处主任白如冰作了报告，对外贸易部部长叶季壮、国务院第四办公室副主任周光春、文化部副部长郑振铎、对外文化联络协会副会长楚图南等都参加了会议。
    下午，中共中央副主席朱德接见了全体代表，并在会上讲话，向代表们作了重要指示。他预祝会议成功，祝贺工艺美术事业的发展。他勉励艺人们带更多的徒弟，把我国几千年来传统的工艺美术事业永远传下去，越来越好。
    朱德副主席还参观了代表们的作品。
