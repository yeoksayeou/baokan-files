    Following Xu Zhucheng, Pu Xixiu spoke. Although she expressed her intention to draw a line between herself and Luo Longji, saying she wanted to "turn from right to left," and also spoke about Luo Longji's relationship with the American consulate before liberation and with Zhang Dongsun after liberation, she tried her best to cover up Luo Longji's activities to control Wenhui Bao through her, as mentioned in Xu Zhucheng's speech. She admitted that her previous statement that "Wenhui Bao has nothing to do with Luo Longji" was wrong, but she only said that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji strongly supported the resumption of Wenhui Bao's publication, and that she was only "unconsciously influenced by them." Pu Xixiu did not reveal the truth about Luo Longji's control of Wenhui Bao through her.

    浦熙修不交代罗通过她控制文汇报的阴谋
    浦熙修继徐铸成之后发言。她虽然表示要和罗隆基划清界限，说是要“由右向左转”，也谈了一些关于罗隆基在解放前同美国领事馆的关系，在解放后同张东荪的关系，但是，对徐铸成发言中提到的罗隆基通过她来控制文汇报的活动却竭力加以掩盖。她承认以前说“文汇报与罗隆基没有关系”的话是错了，但是她只说文汇报复刊时，章、罗十分赞成，她说，她只是“不知不觉地受了他们的熏染”。浦熙修没有揭露罗隆基通过她来控制文汇报的真相。
