Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, Leningrad Dispatch: According to TASS, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kuusinen, Furtseva, Khrushchev, and Shvernik arrived in Leningrad on July 6th. Representing the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, they presented orders and medals to the workers of Leningrad, awarded on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Leningrad (June 23rd). A total of 7,226 people received various orders or medals for their outstanding achievements in industry, science, and culture during this award ceremony.

After the award ceremony that day, grand rallies of working people were held in enterprises such as the "Elektrosila" Electrical Machinery Factory, the Kirov Factory, the Hardware Factory, the "Rabochy" Textile Factory, the Baltic Shipyard, and the Kirov Textile Factory in Leningrad. Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kuusinen, Furtseva, Shvernik, and Kozlov, First Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Party Committee and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered speeches at these meetings.

In their speeches, Khrushchev and others congratulated the employees of these factories who were awarded state honors, and all the people of Leningrad. They pointed out the glorious position Leningrad occupied in the entire history of the Soviet state, and also talked about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction and foreign policy, as well as the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee regarding the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov. They all expressed their apologies for the fact that the members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee were unable to come here on June 23rd to participate in the 250th anniversary celebration of the founding of Leningrad.

Khrushchev told the employees of the "Elektrosila" Electrical Machinery Factory that Leningrad occupies a special position among the many great cities in the world. Forty years ago, the cannon fire from the "Aurora" in your city announced to the world the birth of a new world – the socialist world. In the struggle to build a socialist society in the Soviet Union, the residents of Leningrad have also made great contributions. Together with the entire Soviet people, they have selflessly struggled to transform our country into a powerful industrial nation. Leningrad has always been a powerful base for the country's industrialization. The communists, the working class and intellectuals of Leningrad have always been the loyal pillars of the Party Central Committee. After the war, the heroic city of Leningrad became a bastion of industrial and technological progress in our country.

Khrushchev said that the achievements of Soviet industry and of our entire country are great and remarkable. We hope that our industry, and the foundation of industry – heavy industry – will continue to develop and strengthen, and that Soviet agriculture will be more effectively improved and developed. We hope that Soviet people can have an ample supply of meat, fats, dairy products, and fruits, and that there will be many inexpensive and high-quality textiles, clothing, and everything that beautifies people's lives in the stores. To achieve this goal, we must solve some major and difficult tasks, the solution of which requires the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the entire Soviet people, and requires fundamental improvements in economic management.

Speaking of the resolution of the Party Central Committee's plenary session on the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov, he said that this group came up with a sinister plan. This group wanted to seize the main positions in the Party and the state in order to change the Party's political line. They actively opposed many measures, such as expanding the rights of the union republics in economic and cultural construction, as well as in legislation, opposing the reorganization of industrial and construction management, opposing catching up with the United States in per capita production of milk, oil, and meat in recent years, and opposing other very important measures taken by the Party to improve the material life of the Soviet people. In foreign policy, this group, especially Comrade Molotov, did everything possible to obstruct the implementation of measures to ease international tensions and to strengthen world peace. They most admired the policy of "tightening all screws," which is contrary to the wise Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence between socialist and capitalist systems.

Khrushchev said that, as pointed out in the resolution of the Central Committee, they are sectarians and dogmatists in both domestic and foreign policy issues, and they treat Marxism-Leninism with a lifeless, pedantic attitude. When they realized that all their incorrect statements were often countered within the Presidium of the Central Committee, they embarked on the path of secret collusion, the path of sectarian struggle, which was condemned by the Party. Now everyone knows what the outcome of their anti-Party activities has been. The Party Central Committee unanimously condemned this anti-Party group and Shepilov, a personal careerist who followed this group and has in fact become the most shameless double-dealer.

Khrushchev then said that the Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov group chose the eve of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Leningrad to launch a fierce attack on the Party Central Committee. The discussion on the issue of the members and alternate members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and the secretaries of the Central Committee going to Leningrad to participate in the anniversary celebrations became the fuse that led the members of the anti-Party group to take direct action against the collective leadership of the Central Committee.

Khrushchev said that the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee has been unanimously approved by our entire Party and the entire Soviet people. The exposure and unanimous condemnation of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov by the CPSU Central Committee's plenary session, our entire Party, and the people of the whole country will help to more smoothly realize the historically significant resolutions of the 20th Party Congress, because the forces that tried every possible way to hinder the implementation of these resolutions have been eliminated.

The Party and the entire Soviet people have more closely united their ranks around the fighting core of our Party – its Leninist Central Committee, around our beloved Soviet government. No one, at any time, can shake this unity. No one, at any time, can lead the Party away from the only correct Leninist path.

Voroshilov said at the mass meeting in the Kirov Factory that the world's first country of proletarian dictatorship, established forty years ago, has withstood all kinds of unprecedented and arduous tests and has become a powerful country in the world. The people of Leningrad, under the leadership of the Leningrad Party organization, which is as united and firm as a rock, are at the forefront of the struggle to realize the historic resolutions of the 20th Party Congress.

Speaking of the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, Voroshilov said that the anti-Party group attempted to seize the Party's leading organs and change the Party's policies. But the Soviet people are very clear that the Party and the state have already achieved outstanding achievements in the further development of industry and agriculture, in cultural construction, in improving the material welfare of the working people, and in consolidating peace and friendship among peoples, due to the implementation of the policy based on the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. Voroshilov emphasized that the Soviet people warmly support this policy. He said that the Communist Party and the Soviet state will steadfastly implement the historic resolutions adopted by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which are in line with the fundamental interests of the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals.

Bulganin delivered a speech at the mass meeting of all employees of the Hardware Factory. He said that the working people of Leningrad and the Leningrad Party organization, with its glorious revolutionary and labor traditions, are the reliable pillars of the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government.

Bulganin also spoke about the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. He said: In the past three or four years, Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov have often directly or indirectly resisted the direction approved by the Party's 20th Congress. The anti-Party group has insisted on its own position, which is contrary to the Party's line, on all major issues in domestic and international life. It has finally embarked on the path of factional struggle against the Party's leadership, with the aim of changing the Party's policies. Bulganin pointed out that the meetings of activists and the meetings of Party organizations held in various places have unanimously and warmly supported and fully supported the resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. He said: This once again shows the rock-solid unity of the Party's ranks, showing that the Party is closely united around the Leninist Central Committee. This will help to further consolidate the Party and the Party's leadership, and will help in the struggle to achieve the Party's general line.

    赫鲁晓夫等在列宁格勒各工厂集会上演说
    号召全苏人民更紧密地团结在党中央周围
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、库西宁、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫和什维尔尼克等，在7月6日到达列宁格勒，分别代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把在列宁格勒建城二百五十周年（6月23日）的时候颁发的勋章和奖章授给列宁格勒的劳动者。在这次授勋中，总共有七千二百二十六人由于在工业、科学和文化方面的卓越成就而获得了各种勋章或奖章。
    在当天举行授勋仪式以后，列宁格勒的“电力”电工器材工厂、基洛夫工厂、五金工厂、“工人”纺织厂、波罗的海造船厂和基洛夫纺织工厂等企业都举行了劳动人民的盛大集会。赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、库西宁、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克和苏共中央主席团委员、列宁格勒州党委员会第一书记科兹诺夫分别在这些会议上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫等在演说中向这些工厂荣获国家奖赏的职工、向全体列宁格勒人表示祝贺。他们指出了列宁格勒在苏维埃国家的全部历史中所占的光荣地位，还谈到了苏联在经济、文化建设和对外政策方面所取得的巨大成就，谈到了苏共中央6月全体会议关于马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫反党集团的决议。他们都对苏共中央主席团委员们没有能够在6月23日赶到这里参加列宁格勒建城二百五十周年纪念活动一点表示歉意。
    赫鲁晓夫向“电力”电工器材工厂的职工说，列宁格勒在全世界许多伟大的城市中占有特殊的地位。四十年前，“阿芙乐尔号”在你们城市发出的炮声，向全世界宣告了一个新世界——社会主义世界的诞生。在苏联建成社会主义社会的斗争中，列宁格勒的居民也作出了伟大的贡献。他们同全体苏联人民在一起忘我地为把我国变为强大的工业国而奋斗。列宁格勒向来是国家工业化的强大基地。列宁格勒的共产党员、工人阶级和知识分子一向是党中央忠实的支柱。战后，英雄城列宁格勒成了我国工业技术进步的堡垒。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联工业的成就、我们整个国家的成就是伟大的、卓越的。我们希望，我们的工业和工业的基础的基础——重工业得到继续的发展和加强，苏联的农业得到更有效的提高和发展。我们希望，苏联人能够有充裕的肉类、油脂、奶类和水果，在商店中能有许多价廉物美的纺织品、服装和一切美化人们生活的东西。而要达到这一目的，我们还要解决一些重大的和困难的任务，这些任务的解决，需要全体苏联人民发挥创造性的主动精神和积极性，需要对经济领导作根本改进。
    在谈到党中央全体会议关于马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫反党集团的决议时，他说，这个集团想出了阴险的计划。这个集团想夺取党内和国家中的主要阵地，以便改变党的政治路线。他们积极地反对许多措施，像反对扩大加盟共和国在经济建设和文化建设方面，以及在立法方面的权利，反对改组工业与建设的管理，反对在最近几年内在奶类、油类和肉类的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国，并且反对党为了改善苏联人民的物质生活而采取的其它一些十分重要的措施。在对外政策方面，这个集团，特别是莫洛托夫同志百般阻挠实行缓和国际紧张局势的措施，阻挠加强世界和平。他们最欣赏“拧紧一切螺丝”的政策，这是违背列宁主义关于社会主义与资本主义制度和平共处的英明政策的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，正如中央全会的决议中所指出的，他们无论在国内政策和外交政策的问题上都是宗派主义者和教条主义者，他们以死气沉沉的书呆子态度对待马克思列宁主义。当他们知道他们一切不正确的言论经常在中央委员会主席团内遭到反击的时候，他们走上了被党谴责的秘密勾结的道路，宗派斗争的道路。现在大家已经知道，他们的反党活动得到了怎样的下场。党中央委员会一致谴责这个反党集团和追随这个集团并且事实上已成为最恬不知耻的两面派的个人野心家谢皮洛夫。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫集团选定列宁格勒建城二百五十周年纪念日前夕对党中央委员会发动了猛烈的攻击。关于苏共中央委员会主席团委员和候补委员、中央委员会书记去列宁格勒参加纪念活动问题的讨论，成了反党集团成员直接行动起来反对中央委员会集体领导的导火线。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏共中央六月全会的决议得到了我们全党和苏联全体人民的一致赞同。苏共中央全会和我们全党，以及全国人民对马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫反党集团的揭露和一致谴责，将有助于更顺利地实现二十次党代会具有历史意义的决议，因为，清除了那些企图千方百计阻碍实现这些决议的势力。
    党、全体苏联人民更加紧密地把自己的队伍团结在我们党的战斗核心——它的列宁主义的中央委员会的周围，团结在我们亲爱的苏联政府的周围。无论什么时候，无论什么人都不能动摇这种团结。无论什么时候，无论什么人都不能使党脱离唯一正确的列宁主义的道路。
    伏罗希洛夫在基洛夫工厂的群众大会上说，四十年前建立起来的世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家经住了种种前所未闻的艰难考验，成为世界上一个强大的国家了。列宁格勒人在久经锻炼的磐石般团结的列宁格勒党组织的领导下，为实现第二十次党代表大会的历史性决议而走在斗争的最前列。
    在谈到苏共中央六月全会决议的时候，伏罗希洛夫说，反党集团企图把党的领导机关抓到自己手里，并且改变党的政策。但是苏联人民非常清楚，党和国家由于执行了以第二十次党代表大会的决议为基础的政策，已经在进一步发展工农业方面，在文化建设方面，在提高劳动人民物质福利方面，以及在巩固和平和各国人民友谊方面获得了杰出的成就。伏罗希洛夫强调指出，苏联人民热烈地支持这个政策。他说，共产党和苏维埃国家将坚定不移地实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所通过的符合工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子根本利益的历史性决议。
    布尔加宁在五金工厂全体职工群众大会上发表了演说。他说，列宁格勒劳动人民和具有光荣革命传统和劳动传统的列宁格勒党组织是党中央和苏联政府的可靠支柱。
    布尔加宁也谈到了苏共中央六月全会的决议。他说：马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫在最近三、四年来经常直接或间接地抵制党的第二十次代表大会所赞同的方针。反党集团在国内和国际生活中的一切重大问题上都坚持自己同党的路线背驰的立场，它终于走上了对党的领导进行集团斗争的道路，其目的是改变党的政策。布尔加宁指出，各地举行的积极分子集会和党组织的会议都一致热烈拥护并完全支持苏共中央全会的决议，他说：这再次表明了党的队伍坚如磐石的团结，表明了党紧密地团结在列宁主义的中央委员会的周围，这有助于进一步巩固党和党的领导，有助于争取实现党的总路线的斗争。
