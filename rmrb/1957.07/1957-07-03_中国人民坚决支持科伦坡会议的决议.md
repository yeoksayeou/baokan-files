Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The resolution of the All-China People's Celebration of the World Peace Council's Colombo Conference Victory Rally. The full text is as follows:

    The All-China People's Celebration of the World Peace Council's Colombo Conference Victory Rally listened with great satisfaction to the report by Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Colombo Conference, on the course and achievements of the conference.

    The Chinese people express warm welcome and congratulations on the brilliant achievements of the Colombo Conference and its great contribution to the development of the world peace cause!

    The大会 unanimously believes that the successful convening of the World Peace Council in the Asian region for the first time is of important historical significance, which shows that the world peace movement has new developments. The resolutions adopted at the meeting are a major call for defending world peace. These resolutions reflect the common aspirations and firm will of the people of all countries to demand peace, oppose war, eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, and safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism.

    The大会 is deeply convinced that the resolutions of the Colombo Conference will greatly help promote and encourage the people of the world to defend peace, demand the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, and maintain national independence and oppose colonialism, and will play a significant role in further easing international tensions and strengthening friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries.

    We peace-loving Chinese people fully support the resolutions and suggestions adopted by the Colombo Conference and are willing to unite with the people of all countries, overcome difficulties and obstacles, and work together to implement these resolutions.

    At present, the US government is still creating tensions in Asia, the Near and Middle East, Europe, and around the world, continuing to pursue its aggressive policy and threatening peace. Recently, it has once again violated the Korean Armistice Agreement by importing new weapons into South Korea and stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and all peace-loving people.

    The大会 solemnly reiterates that the Chinese people support the recent Soviet proposal for a new disarmament plan and the reasonable demand for the conclusion of an international agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America against colonialism! Support the just struggle of the Arab people against the Eisenhower Doctrine and to safeguard national independence and sovereignty! Support the just struggle of the Japanese people against US aggression! Support all efforts in the world to strive for peace and oppose war!

    The大会 wishes success to the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to be held in Japan in August.

    The Chinese people will more actively strive to build their motherland with practical actions to enhance the strength to defend peace. We are willing to unite more closely with all peace-loving forces in the world and work together for new and greater victories in the cause of world peace.
                                      July 2, 1957 in Beijing

    中国首都各界人民庆祝世界和平理事会科伦坡会议胜利大会非常满意地听取了出席科伦坡会议中国代表团郭沫若团长关于会议的经过和成就的传达报告。
    中国人民对科伦坡会议的辉煌成就及其对发展世界和平事业所做的巨大贡献，表示热烈欢迎和庆贺！
    大会一致认为，世界和平理事会首次在亚洲地区胜利召开，具有重要历史意义，这表明世界和平运动有了新的发展。会议所通过的决议，是当前保卫世界和平的重大号召。这些决议反映了世界各国人民要求和平、反对战争的共同愿望和坚决意志。
    大会深信，科伦坡会议的决议，将大大有助于推动和鼓舞世界人民保卫和平、要求停止核武器试验、消除核武器威胁和维护民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，并且对进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国人民的友好合作，将发生重大作用。
    我们爱好和平的中国人民，完全拥护和支持科伦坡会议所通过的各项决议和建议，并且愿意同各国人民团结一起，克服困难和阻碍，为实现这些决议而共同努力。
    目前，美国政府还在亚洲、中近东、欧洲以及在世界各地制造紧张局势，继续推行侵略政策，威胁和平。最近，又再次破坏朝鲜停战协定，将新式武器输入南朝鲜，加紧扩军备战。这是中国人民和一切爱好和平的人民所绝不能容忍的。
    大会庄严重申：中国人民拥护苏联最近提出的裁军新方案和要求缔结停止试验核武器的国际协定的合理主张。中国人民坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义的正义斗争！支持阿拉伯人民反对艾森豪威尔主义和维护民族独立、主权的正义斗争！支持日本人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争！支持世界上一切争取和平、反对战争的努力！
    大会预祝8月间将在日本举行的第三届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军世界大会成功。
    中国人民将更积极地以实际行动来努力建设自己的祖国，以增强保卫和平的力量。我们愿意和世界上一切爱好和平的力量更紧密地团结一致，为世界和平事业获得新的更大的胜利而共同奋斗。
