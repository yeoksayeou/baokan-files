    Feng Yidai Conspires to Usurp the Foreign Languages Press
    Simultaneously "Setting Fires" in Various Organs Under the Direction of Tao Dayong and Fei Xiaotong

    (Our dispatch) The entire staff of the Foreign Languages Press has exposed and criticized a series of counter-Party and anti-socialist crimes committed by the rightist Feng Yidai. Feng Yidai is the deputy director of the Chinese Literature Editing Department of the Foreign Languages Press and the chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL) branch. He is also the deputy secretary-general of the CDL Beijing Municipal Committee and a representative of the people of Beijing. During the rectification campaign, he used the above-mentioned identities as a cover to "help the Party rectify its work," lighting fires everywhere and launching attacks on the Party from all sides.

    Calling on CDL Members to Light the First Fire

    Before the Party Central Committee issued the directive on rectification, Feng Yidai played the role of actively implementing the instructions of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. As early as April 24th, he convened an enlarged branch committee meeting of the CDL branch of the Foreign Languages Press to mobilize people to light fires. At this meeting, he criticized CDL members for "insufficient political sensitivity and lack of attention to the political climate." He stipulated that "henceforth, airing views and speaking out would be the central work of the CDL," and that CDL members should "take the lead in airing views and speaking out." After this, Feng Yidai actively sought out people who were usually dissatisfied with the Party and leading comrades and encouraged them to attack the Party. On May 14th, Feng Yidai used the name of a "CDL branch symposium" to gather these people together for the first mobilization meeting to launch a major attack on the Party. At this meeting, Feng Yidai wanted Li Huangwu, who had already left the Foreign Languages Press, to act as a gunner. Li Huangwu's entire speech was filled with extremely blatant hatred for the Party organization and Party leading cadres of the Foreign Languages Press. He described the Foreign Languages Press as a complete mess, cursing the Party leading cadres as "dog shit" and "bureaucratic overlords." He viciously attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, opposed the leadership of the Party, and bluntly said: "The CDL in the organs adheres to the intentions of the Party and government leadership, this must be changed in the future." These reactionary remarks won applause from the rightists in the agency. Seeing that lighting the fire was effective, Feng Yidai then convened a second symposium of the CDL branch, this time "inviting" back those who had been investigated during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and those who were dissatisfied with the Party to "pour out their grievances." Immediately afterward, another group of those who had been investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were connected, and they were asked to "air their views" at the third CDL symposium, but this meeting was not held because the struggle against the rightists began.

    Slandering the Foreign Languages Press as a "Barracks in the Era of Tsarist Russia"

    The "fire-lighting" meetings organized by Feng Yidai encouraged other rightists in the Foreign Languages Press, and some of those who were investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and those who hated the Party also rose up to make wild remarks and attack the Party. At this time, Feng Yidai thought that he had mastered the masses, and that most people could be manipulated and commanded by him. Therefore, at a symposium of democratic parties held by the Party General Branch of the Foreign Languages Press, he openly clamored with murderous intent: "There is public resentment in this agency, and the lid has not yet been lifted. There must be small democracy, and small democracy cannot solve the problem." What he meant by "small democracy" was actually to launch a big democracy. In order to explain the so-called "public resentment," Feng Yidai added all kinds of vicious charges to the Party organization and Party leading cadres of the Foreign Languages Press. He slandered the Foreign Languages Press as a "family world" of Party members, a "barracks in the era of Tsarist Russia, imprisoning criminals." He said that the Foreign Languages Press "has walls within walls, ditches within ditches, and even the Forbidden City." He desperately attacked the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was done subjectively, with sectarianism, and dogmatism," and "was a farce." He wanted to "cry out for injustice" for those who were struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries who were "survivors of the catastrophe." He tried his best to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and obliterated the achievements of ideological remolding, saying that "non-Party cadres are not trusted, they are only used but not reformed, and they only get beaten," and "political ideology is strengthened, the enthusiasm of comrades is cancelled, and only a group of Party members who do not understand the business are promoted and given higher grades." He felt that he "had the title but no power," "lived the life of a daughter-in-law," and slandered the Party for "not treating him as a human being." He even more viciously attempted to provoke the ill will of all CDL members towards the Party, and slandered the Party organization for "beating the CDL organization with sticks without rhyme or reason," "almost causing the CDL to collapse." He pretended to use these so-called "public resentments" to stand up and "uncover the lid" for the Party in the Foreign Languages Press. He declared in a threatening tone, "I represent the CDL and will do my best to help the Party dismantle the walls!" In order to seize the leadership of the agency, he promoted that the Foreign Languages Press was "ignorant leadership leading the knowledgeable," and the implication was that "the ignorant" should step down and "the knowledgeable" should step up. This is the real purpose of what Feng Yidai said "to solve the problem with small democracy." After this symposium, he even used the name of the CDL branch to demand the removal of this or that Party leading cadre, and privately spread rumors that he wanted to be the deputy director of the Foreign Languages Press.

    Becoming Carried Away, Vainly Attempting to "Clean Up the Mess"

    During the rectification campaign, Feng Yidai became a "view-airing expert," colluding and instigating everywhere. He said to some senior intellectuals, "You should talk about the problems of intellectuals." He thought that some people's speeches were "not flavorful enough," and wanted to "help 'them' 'break down their concerns'." He spread rumors such as "someone wants to join the Party but is afraid to speak," and attacked activists who leaned towards the Party. When Sun Zhanke (a Party member) made anti-Party remarks, he cheered and welcomed them, saying that "it played a good role," and openly called on other Party members to learn from Sun to "take the lead in uncovering the lid," and personally organized a "siege" of another Party member, wanting to "open a gap" from him. He was particularly enthusiastic about inciting some of those who were investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to "cry out for injustice." He shamelessly used the name of Wu Han, the person in charge of the CDL Beijing Municipal Committee, and actively organized five people who were investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to write "opinions," asking each person to write three copies and hand them over to him to be forwarded to Wu Han, and especially emphasized that Wu Han was a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, implying that they could ask the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to "rehabilitate" them through Wu Han!

    At this time, he became even more carried away. He estimated that the Party leadership of the Foreign Languages Press "would definitely collapse this time," so he could not help but say to Ding Cong (a CDL member), the deputy editor-in-chief of the People's Pictorial of the agency, "Now it's our turn to clean up," which completely exposed his face as a rightist ambitious figure who was connected to the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

    Setting Fires Everywhere, Fearing That the World Would Not Be in Chaos

    Feng Yidai not only "set fires" in the Foreign Languages Press, but also actively "set fires" in various organs in Beijing. All of his evil activities were discussed with the strategists Tao Dayong and Fei Xiaotong of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and received their encouragement and instructions.

    Last year, he went to Beijing Normal University to inspect work as a representative of the people of Beijing. Afterwards, the inspection report he drafted described the Normal University as "a mess," and it was only sent to the relevant authorities in Beijing after being reviewed and revised by Tao Dayong. In mid-May of this year, four students from the "Bitter Medicine Society" of Normal University suddenly wanted to visit Feng Yidai. Feng immediately "asked for instructions" from Tao Dayong by telephone, and then, according to Tao's instructions, made a long speech to the students. In this speech, he slandered Normal University for "having a wide scope of struggle in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and those who usually made suggestions to the school leaders were all among those being struggled against." He said that the policy of Normal University towards intellectuals was "completely negating the old professors," and that the united front policy there was "long-term coexistence, one party supervising," and "when there is a problem with the democratic parties, the stick will come." After the students of the "Bitter Medicine Society" returned to school, they organized this speech and posted it in the form of big-character posters. The fire that Feng Yidai set cooperated with the rightists of Normal University to attack the Party.

    On May 16th and 23rd, Feng Yidai and Tao Dayong went to the Academy of Arts and Crafts twice in the name of "inspecting work" to "light fires," and specially invited reporters from Wenhui Daily to interview them. Feng Yidai encouraged the rightist Pang Xunqin to attack the Party leadership of the academy, supported the demand to replace Dean Deng Jie, and asked Pang to write an article for publication.

    On May 19th, Feng Yidai and Tao Dayong went to "inspect" the urban service training class. After listening to the dissatisfaction of some workers, they said to the director of the Urban Service Bureau, "If the leader is incompetent, he will have to be dismissed."

    Feng Yidai also colluded with Tao Dayong to attack the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. Feng urged the Ministry of Culture to convene a symposium of democratic parties as soon as possible, and Tao provided him with speech materials. At the symposium on publishing work convened by the Ministry of Culture, Feng Yidai said that the Foreign Languages Press was "a mess," and "ignorant leadership leading the knowledgeable" The leadership of the Ministry of Culture "must also be responsible." He also privately told people that he wanted to start a "cooperative publishing house."

    Before the start of the rectification campaign, Feng Yidai offered advice to Fei Xiaotong, requesting the CDL organization to strengthen its work in the literary and art circles. He himself also drilled into the film and drama circles to engage in activities, lobbying Yuan Shuhua, Xin Fengxia, and others to join the CDL. During the rectification campaign, the symposium of the film industry convened in the name of the CDL Municipal Committee was presided over by Feng Yidai. He advocated giving a "stimulus" to the rectification of the Film Bureau.

    Why was Feng Yidai so "active" during the rectification campaign? It turned out that he not only wanted to be the deputy director of the Foreign Languages Press, but according to the exposure of Jin Ruonian of the CDL Beijing Municipal Committee, he also wanted to "become a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a member of the Central Committee of the CDL."

    Peeling off the Skin to See

    Feng Yidai has always been a two-faced and insidious character in history. In 1933, he joined the reactionary organization Qing Gang and served as a director. In 1941, he joined the Hong Gang and became sworn brothers with the gang leader and Kuomintang secret service agents, and messed around with them. In 1938, he joined the name of the counter-revolutionary Ling Xianyang, and later served as the deputy director of the pseudo-Central Printing Factory hosted by Ling, and persecuted workers with Ling. In 1944, Feng Yidai joined the Kuomintang through the introduction of Ye Chucang. In 1947, Feng Yidai also helped "Voice of America" to make suggestions, and received 25 US dollars per month. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, Feng Yidai constantly had close contacts with Wang Xinheng, the head of the Kuomintang secret service agents. After liberation, Feng Yidai continued to play two-faced tricks. In 1955, when the nationwide struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique unfolded, he publicly published articles in the newspaper opposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, while secretly telling the masses that "Hu Feng was beaten too fiercely," and "there will be no Hu Feng elements in the Foreign Languages Press," attempting to slacken morale and undermine the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement.

    Now Feng Yidai's true face has been exposed in broad daylight, but he is still adopting tactics of dodging and avoiding the important and emphasizing the trivial, attempting to muddle through. The entire staff of the Foreign Languages Press is determined not to give up until Feng Yidai's counter-Party and anti-socialist crimes are thoroughly clarified.

    冯亦代阴谋篡夺外文出版社
    同时在陶大镛费孝通指使下到各机关“放火”
    本报讯　外文出版社全体工作人员对右派分子冯亦代一系列的反党反社会主义的罪恶言行进行了揭露和批判。冯亦代是外文出版社中国文学编辑部的副主任和民盟支部的主任委员，他又是民盟北京市委的副秘书长和北京市的人民代表。在整风期间，他利用了上述各种身份，以“帮助党整风”为幌子，到处点火，从各个方面向党发动进攻。
    号召盟员点起第一把火
    在党中央发布整风指示以前，冯亦代就扮演了一个积极执行章罗联盟指示的角色。还在4月24日，他就召集了外文出版社民盟支部的扩大支委会议进行点火动员，在这次会上，他责备盟员“政治敏感不够，没有注意政治气候”。他规定“今后鸣放就是盟的中心工作”，盟员应该“带头鸣放”。冯亦代在这以后，即积极搜罗平时对党对领导同志不满的人进行鼓动，鼓动他们向党开火。5月14日，冯亦代用“民盟支部座谈会”名义，把这些人召集在一起开了第一次向党大举进攻的动员会。这次会议上冯亦代要已经离开外文出版社的李荒芜充当炮手。李荒芜的通篇发言充满了对于外文出版社党组织和党员领导干部极端露骨的仇恨，他把外文出版社说成一团漆黑，咒骂党员领导干部是“狗屎”“官僚老爷们”。他恶毒地攻击肃反运动，反对党的领导，并露骨地说：“民盟在机关中秉承党政领导的意旨，这一条今后要改一改”。这些反动言论博得了社内右派分子的喝彩。冯亦代一看点火有效，接着又召集了民盟支部第二次座谈会，这次又把已调离外文出版社的在肃反中被审查的对象及对党不满的人“邀请”回来“吐苦水”。紧接着又串连好另一批肃反中被审查的对象，让他们在第三次民盟座谈会上“鸣放”，因反右派斗争开始，这次会未开成。
    诬蔑外文出版社是“帝俄时代的兵营”
    冯亦代组织的“点火”会鼓舞了外文出版社的其他右派分子，一部分在肃反中被审查的对象和对党有仇恨的人也跟着起来大放厥词，向党进攻。冯亦代这时以为他已经掌握了群众，大多数的人都可以受他操纵和指挥，于是在外文出版社党总支召开的民主党派座谈会上，他公然杀气腾腾地叫嚣说：“本社有公愤，现在盖子尚未揭开，必须有小民主，小小民主解决不了问题”。他所说要有“小民主”，实际上是要掀起大民主。冯亦代为了解释他所说的“公愤”，给外文出版社的党组织和党员领导干部加上了种种恶毒的罪名，他诬蔑外文出版社是党员的“家天下”，是“帝俄时代的兵营，关犯人的”，他说外文出版社“墙内有墙，沟内有沟，还有紫禁城”；他拼命攻击肃反运动，说“肃反是凭主观、宗派、教条主义办事”，“是一场滑稽戏”，要为“劫后余生”的肃反中被斗的人“喊冤”；他竭力挑拨党和知识分子的关系，抹杀思想改造的成绩，说“非党干部不被信任，是利用而不改造，只有吃棍子”，“政治思想加强，同志们的积极性被取消了，只多了一批不懂业务的党员升官加级”；他认为自己“有职无权”，“过的是小媳妇的生活”，诬蔑党“不把他当人看待”。他更恶毒地企图挑起全体盟员对党的恶感，污蔑党组织对民盟组织“没头没脑地打棍子”，“差不多使盟垮了台”。他假借这些所谓“公愤”挺身而出要为外文出版社的党来“揭盖子”，他用威胁的口吻宣称“我代表盟，一定尽力之所能，帮助党拆墙”！他为了夺取社的领导，宣传外文出版社是“无知领导有知”，言下之意就是“无知者”下台，“有知者”上台。这就是冯亦代所说的“要用小民主解决问题”的真正的目的。在这次座谈会之后，他竟用民盟支部的名义，要求撤掉这个那个党员领导干部，并私下散布他要当外文出版社副社长的流言。
    得意忘形，妄想“收拾残局”
    在整风期间，冯亦代成了“鸣放专家”，到处串连煽动。他对一些高级知识分子说“你应当谈谈知识分子问题”。有些人的发言，他认为“不够味”，要“帮助‘他们’‘打破顾虑’”。他散布“某人想入党，不敢讲话”之类的流言，对靠拢党的积极分子进行打击。孙战科（党员）发表了反党言论，他喝彩欢迎，说是“起了良好作用”，公然号召其他党员向孙学习“带头揭盖子”，并亲自组织对另一个党员进行“围攻”，要从他这里“打开一个缺口”。他特别起劲地煽动一些在肃反中被审查的对象起来“喊冤”，他无耻地假借民盟北京市委负责人吴晗的名义，积极地组织了五个肃反中被审查的对象写“意见书”，要每人写三份交给他转吴晗，并特别强调吴晗是人大常委，暗示可以经过吴晗要求人大常委给他们“平反”！
    这时候，他更得意忘形了，他估计外文出版社党的领导“这一下非垮不行了”，于是他也情不自禁地向该社人民画报副总编辑丁聪（盟员）说“现在该轮到我们来收了”，这就把他与章罗联盟一脉相通的右派野心家的面目彻底暴露了。
    到处放火唯恐天下不乱
    冯亦代不仅在外文出版社“放火”，同时也积极地在北京市各机关“放火”，他的这一切罪恶活动，都是同章罗联盟的谋士陶大镛、费孝通商量过，并得到他们的鼓励和指示的。
    他在去年曾以北京市人民代表的身份到北京师范大学去视察工作。事后他草拟的视察报告，把师大说得“一团糟”，并经陶大镛审阅修改之后才送给北京市有关当局。今年5月中旬忽然有师范大学“苦药社”的四个学生要访问冯亦代，冯当即用电话“请示”陶大镛后，即根据陶的指示对学生发表了长篇谈话，在这篇谈话中，他污蔑师大
  “肃反的斗争面很广，平时对学校领导人提意见的人都在被斗之列”，说师大对知识分子的政策就是“对老教授一笔抹煞”，又说那里的统战政策是“长期共存，一方监督”，民主党派“一出问题棍子就来了”等等。“苦药社”的学生回校把这篇谈话整理后，用大字报公布出来，冯亦代放的这一把火，就配合了师大右派分子的向党进攻。
    5月16日和23日，冯亦代两次和陶大镛一起，借“视察工作”为名到工艺美术学院去“点火”，并特别约请文汇报记者去采访。冯亦代鼓励右派分子庞熏琴对该院党的领导的攻击，支持撤换邓洁院长的要求，并要庞写文章发表。
    5月19日冯亦代又和陶大镛去“视察”城市服务训练班，他们听了某些工人的不满意见之后就对城市服务局局长说“如果领导人不称职，就只好撤职了”。
    冯亦代还和陶大镛串通向文化部出版局进攻，冯催文化部赶快召开民主党派座谈会，由陶供给他发言材料。冯亦代在文化部召开的出版工作座谈会上说外文出版社“一团糟”，“无知领导有知”文化部领导上“也要负责”。并私下向人表示要办一个“同人出版社”。
    冯亦代在整风开始前就向费孝通献策，要求民盟组织加强文艺界的工作，他自己也钻进电影界、戏剧界去活动，游说袁淑华、新凤霞等参加民盟。整风期间，以民盟市委名义召开的电影界座谈会就是冯亦代主持的，他主张对电影局的整风给以“刺激”。
    冯亦代为什么在整风期间如此“活跃”呢？原来他不仅要当外文出版社的副社长，据民盟北京市委金若年的揭发，他还想“当上全国政协委员和民盟中央委员”。
    剥开皮来看
    冯亦代在历史上一向就是个两面派的阴险人物。他在1933年就参加了反动组织青帮，并担任过理事。1941年他又参加了红帮，和帮会把头，军统特务结拜成把兄弟，在一起鬼混。1938年他投到反革命分子凌宪扬的名下，后在凌所主持的伪中央印刷厂任副厂长，并和凌一起迫害过工人。1944年冯亦代又经叶楚伧介绍参加了国民党。1947年冯亦代还为“美国之音”帮忙提意见，每月拿二十五元美金。在抗日战争和解放战争期间，冯亦代不断和军统特务头子王新衡有过密切往来。解放后，冯亦代仍然玩弄两面派的手法，1955年全国展开反对胡风反革命集团的斗争时，他一面公开在报上发表文章反对胡风反革命集团，一面又在背后对群众说“对胡风打得太凶”，“外文出版社不会有什么胡风分子”，企图松懈斗志，破坏肃反斗争。
    现在冯亦代的真实面目已暴露在光天化日之下，但他还在采取躲躲闪闪，避重就轻的战术，企图蒙混过关。外文出版社的全体工作人员抱定决心，不将冯亦代的反党反社会主义的罪恶言行彻底弄清，决不罢休。
