    A Polar Bear Sent Thousands of Miles: A Precious Gift of Friendship
    Soviet Aviation Personnel from the Arctic Present a Gift to Chinese Youth Friends
    (Our Dispatch) According to a report in the Soviet "Festival News": One day in June, a vigorous, tanned, and tall middle-aged man came to the editorial department of a Moscow newspaper, "Soviet Russia." He held a small white bear in his arms.
    As soon as he entered, he introduced himself:
  "My name is Aguladev." "I brought you a letter from the Arctic." As he spoke, he took a letter from his pocket. The letter read:
  "Dear Comrades! The Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship is about to open.
    We want to send a memorable gift to the festival, but what should we send? People who live and work on the mainland can easily solve this problem: they can prepare various gifts that reflect the life and natural characteristics of the region. But what about us? Should we send participants a piece of Arctic ice? You know, the ice will melt on the way!..."
    Later, we decided to send a small white bear. This little white bear was caught in May. We asked Comrade Aguladev, a navigator of the Arctic Air Force, to bring it to Moscow and hand it over to the editorial department along with the letter. Because we must stay in the Arctic during the festival, we cannot deliver this gift in person. Now, we ask you to pass our gift on to the members of the Chinese delegation participating in the festival.
    We did not name the little bear, because we want to leave this pleasure to our Chinese friends.
    Soviet Hero, Captain: Samarov
    Pilots: Gorbachev, Mayurov
    Flight Mechanic: Bugarin
    Flight Radio Operator: Robukhov"
    That day, this "traveler" from the Arctic was sent to the Moscow Zoo. It will be a guest there until the festival opens. Then, as entrusted, it will be delivered to the hands of the Chinese delegation participating in the festival. (Xiao Ying)

    万里送白熊  物珍情意重
    北极的苏联航空人员向中国青年朋友送礼
    本报讯　据苏联“联欢节报”报道：6月的某一天，一位精神焕发，脸色黝黑、个子很高的中年人来到了莫斯科一家报纸——“苏维埃俄罗斯报”的编辑部。他双手抱着一只小白熊。
    一进门，他就自我介绍说：
  “我叫阿古拉德夫”。“我从北极给你们带来一封信。说话间他就从口袋里掏出一封信。信里是这样写的：
  “亲爱的同志们！第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节即将开幕。
    我们想给联欢节送一个有纪念意义的礼物，但是，送什么呢？在大陆上生活和工作的人们对这个问题是很容易解决的：他们可以准备各种各样反映本地区人民生活和自然特色的礼品。而我们怎么办呢？难道给参加联欢节的人们送一块北极的冰块吗？要知道，冰块在路上会融化的啊！……
    后来我们决定送一只小白熊。这只小白熊是在5月里捕到的。我们请北极航空部队的领航员阿古拉德夫同志把它带到莫斯科，并与信一起交给编辑部。由于联欢节期间，我们必须留在北极，所以不能亲自来送这份礼物。现在，代请你们把我们的礼物转交给中国代表团的团员。
    我们没有替小熊起名字，因为我们想把这份愉快留给中国朋友们。
    苏联英雄、机长：萨玛洛夫
    飞行员：格尔巴乔夫、马尤洛夫
    随航机械士：布加林
    随航无线电报员：罗布霍夫”
    当天，这位北极来的“旅客”就被送到莫斯科的动物园里去了。它要在那儿作客，一直到联欢节开幕。然后按照委托被送到参加联欢节的中国代表团的手中。　（小英）
