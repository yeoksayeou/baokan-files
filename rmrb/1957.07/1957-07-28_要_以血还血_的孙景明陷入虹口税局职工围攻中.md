(Our report) In the struggle to counterattack the rightists, the Hongkou District Tax Bureau in Shanghai also exposed a rightist clique. The main figure of this clique, Sun Jingming, was the full-time deputy leader of the electrical and telecommunications industry team of the Hongkou District Tax Bureau. He colluded with rightists in the bureau, including Tong Rongxun, Liao Dinghuang, and Yu Chunxi, to form an anti-Party group. They denigrated the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries and the Three-Anti movements as utterly worthless, organized "accusation meetings" within the bureau, and demanded the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee." They also misappropriated the name of the trade union, selected so-called employee representatives to petition the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and openly said: "We want to peel off the skin of Liu Huamin, the secretary of the Hongkou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party," and "We want blood for blood!" They even planned to spread the fire to more than 10,000 tax workers in the entire city.

In recent days, the vast number of employees in the bureau have been criticizing this right-wing group.

    要“以血还血”的孙景明陷入虹口税局职工围攻中
    本报讯　在反击右派的斗争中，上海市虹口区税务局也揭发了一个右派分子集团。这个集团的首要分子孙景明是虹口区税务局的电器电讯工业专职副组长，他就和局内的右派分子童荣勋、廖定煌、俞春禧伙在一起，结成了反党集团，他们把肃反、三反运动说得一无是处，在局内组织了“控诉会”，要求成立“平反委员会”。并盗用了工会名义，选派了所谓职工代表，向中共上海市委请愿，他们露骨地说：“要剥去中共虹口区区委书记刘化敏的皮”“要以血还血”还打算把火烧到全市一万多税工中去。
    最近几天局里的广大职工正对这个右派集团进行批判。
