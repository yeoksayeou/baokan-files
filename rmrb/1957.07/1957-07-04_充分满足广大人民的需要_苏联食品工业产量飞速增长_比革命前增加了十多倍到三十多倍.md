Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd -- The magazine "Agitator's Handbook," published here, recently pointed out in an article that the output of various products of the Soviet food industry is now more than ten to thirty times higher than before the October Revolution. The consumption of various industrially processed foods by residents has also greatly increased.

The magazine pointed out that, compared with 1913, the Soviet food industry's production of sausage products increased from 60,000 tons to 764,000 tons in 1956, various canned goods increased from 95 million cans to 3.6 billion cans, confectionery increased from more than 100,000 tons to 1.6 million tons, and macaroni products increased from 30,000 tons to nearly 1 million tons.

If calculated per capita, during this period, the amount of canned food available to each resident increased by 25.5 times, confectionery increased by nearly 11 times, macaroni products increased by 22 times, and sugar increased by 1.2 times. The Soviet Union's per capita sugar production has exceeded that of the United States.

Due to an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, the Soviet food industry obtained more raw materials in 1956, such as milk, beets, sunflowers, potatoes, and grapes, than in any previous year. The production plan of the food industry was overfulfilled that year, and the output increased greatly. Among them, the increase in some food industry products even exceeded the total annual production of Tsarist Russia before the revolution. For example, the increase in various canned foods and confectionery in the Soviet Union in 1956 alone was three times and 74% more than the total output of these products produced by Russia in 1913, respectively.

Due to the increase in food industry output, the consumption of various foods by residents has also increased rapidly. According to calculations by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers, compared with the pre-war year of 1940, the average per capita consumption of meat and fats in worker and staff families has now increased by 62%, sugar has increased by 87%, fish and fish products have increased by 92%, and milk and dairy products have more than doubled. In collective farm member families, the average per capita consumption of these foods increased by 54%, 2.6 times, more than doubled, and 47%, respectively.

    充分满足广大人民的需要
    苏联食品工业产量飞速增长
    比革命前增加了十多倍到三十多倍
    新华社莫斯科3日电　此间出版的“鼓动员手册”杂志最近在一篇文章中指出，苏联食品工业的各种产品的产量现在已经比十月革命以前增加了十多倍到三十多倍。居民对工业加工制造的各种食品的消费量也大大增加了。
    这家杂志指出，同1913年比较，1956年苏联食品工业生产的腊肠制品已经由六万吨增加到七十六万四千吨，各种罐头从九千五百万听增加到三十六亿听，糖果点心由十万多吨增加到一百六十万吨，通心粉制品由三万吨增加到将近一百万吨。
    如果按人口平均计算，在这段期间，每个居民所能得到的罐头已经增加了二十五倍半，糖果点心增加了将近十一倍，通心粉制品增加了二十二倍，糖增加了一点二倍。苏联按人口计算的糖产量已经超过了美国。
    由于农业空前大丰收，1956年苏联食品工业得到的原料，如牛奶、甜菜、向日葵、马铃薯、葡萄等，比已往任何一年都多。这一年食品工业的生产计划超额完成了，产量大大增加了。其中，某些食品工业产品的增加额甚至超过了革命前沙皇俄国全年的生产量。譬如，1956年一年苏联增产的各种罐头和糖果点心就比俄国在1913年生产的这些产品的总产量分别多三倍和74％。
    由于食品工业产量的增加，居民对各种食品的消费量也迅速增加了。据苏联部长会议中央统计局计算，同战前的1940年比较，在工人和职员家庭中，现在平均每个人对肉和油脂的消费量增加了62％，糖增加了87％，鱼和鱼制品增加了92％，牛奶和奶制品增加了一倍多。在集体农庄庄员家庭中，平均每个人对这些食品的消费量分别增加了54％，两点六倍，一倍多和47％。
