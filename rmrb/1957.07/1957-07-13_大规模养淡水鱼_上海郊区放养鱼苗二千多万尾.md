Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th:

　　Recently, over 20 million fish fry, including black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, have been successively released into fish breeding ponds of all sizes in the suburbs of Shanghai. This is the largest freshwater fish farming operation in the Shanghai suburbs to date. By the National Day holiday next year, each fish will have grown to weigh two to three *jin* (approximately 1-1.5 kg).

　　The Shanghai Agricultural Bureau also plans to open new fish breeding ponds in the suburbs, purchase fishing boats and nets, and catch fish fry themselves during the Yangtze River fish spawning season. The Shanghai Service Bureau also intends to establish freshwater fish bases in the neighboring Songjiang Prefecture and the Taihu Lake Basin. They have dispatched work teams to select rivers and ponds for fish farming there.

　　The potential for freshwater fish farming in the Shanghai suburbs and the neighboring Songjiang Prefecture of Jiangsu Province is considerable. According to surveys, the suburbs alone have 50,000 *mu* (approximately 3,333 hectares) of natural ponds and rivers suitable for fish farming. If fully utilized, they could produce at least 150,000 *dan* (approximately 7,500 metric tons) of fresh fish annually. Songjiang Prefecture has approximately 700,000 *mu* (approximately 46,667 hectares) suitable for freshwater fish farming.

    大规模养淡水鱼
    上海郊区放养鱼苗二千多万尾
    新华社上海12日电　
  在上海郊区大大小小的鱼种池里，最近陆续放养了二千多万尾青鱼、草鱼、白鲢、胖头等鱼苗。这是上海郊区规模最大的一次饲养淡水鱼。到明年国庆节，每尾鱼就可以长到二、三斤重。
    上海农业局还准备在郊区开辟新的鱼种池，购置渔船和渔网，在长江鱼卵孵化的季节，自己去捕捞鱼苗。上海市服务局也准备在邻近的松江专区和太湖流域建立淡水鱼基地，他们派出工作组正在那里选择养鱼的河流和池塘。
    上海市郊区和邻近上海的江苏省松江专区养殖淡水鱼的潜力很大。据调查，仅郊区可放养的天然池塘和河流就有五万亩，如果充分利用，每年至少可以生产十五万担鲜鱼。松江专区约有七十多万亩可以养殖淡水鱼。
