Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: Seoul News: The US Eighth Army Headquarters, which occupies South Korea, announced yesterday that the US Seventh Division, belonging to this invading army, will be equipped with weapons capable of launching atomic warheads in July, and will be formally reorganized into a "five-atomic-battle-group division."

The communique issued by the Eighth Army Headquarters stated that the reorganization of the US military invading Korea into a "five-atomic-battle-group division" is "part of a comprehensive reorganization of the US Army," and its purpose is to "adapt to the requirements of modern warfare."

After the United States unilaterally announced on June 21 that it would abandon its obligations under Article 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement, it began transporting new-type aircraft capable of carrying atomic bombs into South Korea on June 28. Former US Far East Army Commander White then announced on June 29 that the US Seventh Division and Twenty-Fourth Division in South Korea had been designated to be reorganized into "five-atomic-battle-group divisions."

According to the regulations of the US Department of the Army, the "five-atomic-battle-group division" differs from the three-regiment organization of the general US Army division. It will be composed of five combat groups to meet the needs of conducting atomic warfare. During the reorganization of the US military invading Korea into a "five-atomic-battle-group division," the United States will further violate the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement and transport "Honest John" rocket artillery, long-range howitzers, and new-type tanks and machine guns capable of launching atomic warheads into South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Washington News: The US government on the 15th gave the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan five more patrol boats. These speedboats were transferred in Seattle under the so-called "Common Security Program."

On the 14th, the US government also sent eight Warrior jet bombers to join the Seventh Fleet stationed near Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Washington News: The US government, in allocating "military aid" and "defense support costs" to the Far East in the new fiscal year, has decided to give "priority consideration" to South Korea and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan.

According to an official report from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 86% of the total "military aid" of nearly $700 million will be given to South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, and 84% of the total "defense support costs" of more than $660 million will be given to South Vietnam, South Korea, and Taiwan.

    美国新式飞机运入南朝鲜  侵朝第七师改编为原子师
    蒋介石集团又得到五艘巡逻快艇
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：侵占南朝鲜的美国第八军总部昨天宣布，这支侵略军所属的美军第七师将在7月间装备能够发射原子弹头的武器，正式改编为“五原子编制师”。
    第八军总部发表的公报中说，侵朝美军的改编为“五原子编制师”是“全面改编美国陆军的一部分”，其目的是为了“适应近代战争的要求”。
    美国在6月21日片面宣布废弃它对朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项所规定的义务以后，已经在6月28日开始把能够携带原子弹的新型飞机运入南朝鲜。前美国远东陆军司令怀特紧接着在6月29日宣布，在南朝鲜的美军第七师和第二十四师已经被指定要改组成为“五原子编制师”。
    根据美国陆军部的规定，“五原子编制师”与美国一般陆军师的三团编制不同，它将由五个战斗群组成，以适应进行原子战争的需要。在侵朝美军改编为“五原子编制师”的过程中，美国将进一步破坏朝鲜停战协定的规定，把能够发射原子弹头的“诚实的约翰”火箭炮、长射程榴弹炮以及新式坦克和机关枪运入南朝鲜。
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府15日又给台湾蒋介石集团五艘巡逻快艇。这些快艇是根据所谓“共同安全计划”在西雅图移交的。
    美国政府14日还派了八架勇士式喷气轰炸机参加驻在台湾附近的第七舰队。
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在分配新财政年度给予远东地区的“军事援助”和“防御支持费用”时，决定“优先考虑”南朝鲜和台湾蒋介石集团。
    据众议院外交委员会的一个正式报告透露，在总数近七亿美元的“军事援助”中，将有86％给予南朝鲜、日本和台湾，在总数达六亿六千多万美元的“防御支持费用”中，将有84％给予南越、南朝鲜和台湾。
