    From Assembling Parts to Producing Transmitters: Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory
    Before liberation, the state-owned Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory was a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise. At that time, the factory could only assemble simple products such as five-tube radios using imported American parts. In recent years, the factory has successfully trial-produced eleven types of transmitters, most of which were manufactured for the first time in China.

This type of transmitter can broadcast to the world and can also be used for international communication or telephone calls.

    从装配零件到生产发射机的北京广播器材厂
    国营北京广播器材厂解放以前是个官僚资本主义的企业。那时候，这个工厂只能用美国进口零件装配五灯收音机等简单产品。近几年来，这个工厂试制成功的各种类型的发射机有十一种，其中大部分在国内还是首次制造。
    下图：这个工厂试制成功了大型的一百二十瓩的短波发射机。这种发射机可以向全世界广播，也能用于国际间通报或通话。图为职工们正在安装发射机控制桌的仪表。　新华社记者　喻惠如摄
