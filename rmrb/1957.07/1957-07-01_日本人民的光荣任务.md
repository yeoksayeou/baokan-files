The Glorious Task of the Japanese People
    Pei Da
    Two months ago, an event that shocked the whole country occurred in Ogawa Town, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan - a woman who resolutely opposed military bases was elected mayor. This is currently the only female mayor in Japan. This was what Mr. Yuuji Tashiro, who is currently visiting China, said when interviewed by reporters.

    Mr. Tashiro is the Deputy Secretary-General of the "Japan Socialist Party Military Base Countermeasures Committee" and the "National Military Base Opposition Liaison Council." He spoke with great enthusiasm about the Japanese people's struggle against military bases. He said that the election of this woman as mayor was another new victory in the Japanese people's struggle against military bases after the struggle in Sunagawa Town last year.

    There was an old airfield in Hyakurigahara, Ogawa Town, and the Japanese government planned to rebuild it into a "Self-Defense Force" base. The former mayor, Senzaburo Hataya, was a wealthy man who supported the government's plan, and most of the town councilors also expressed their agreement. However, the women and young people of Ogawa Town resolutely opposed this plan and formed the "Town Loving Comrades Association" to launch a struggle against the local conservative forces headed by the mayor. Their slogans were: "Oppose the base" and "Revitalize town administration." Seeing the unfavorable situation, Mayor Senzaburo Hataya proposed re-election of the mayor and put himself forward as a candidate, attempting to use the re-election to strengthen his position and achieve the goal of establishing a military base. He posted a notice on April 21, announcing that voting would take place within a week, trying to seize power again in a swift manner. However, the results of the re-election on the 28th were completely unexpected by the local conservative forces. Ms. Yamanishi, who was most enthusiastic about opposing the military base, was elected mayor. The arrogant former mayor, Senzaburo Hataya, was defeated by more than 700 votes and reluctantly handed over the town's administration.

    When the news of Ms. Yamanishi's election spread, many old women who had participated in the anti-base struggle happily embraced each other, shedding tears of excitement. The farmers cheerfully brought vegetables and rice cakes to the female mayor's house to congratulate her. Mr. Jiro Fujioka, a 67-year-old who participated in the anti-base struggle, said: "We will cooperate with the new mayor to launch a struggle like the one in Sunagawa Town." Ms. Yamanishi also said with confidence: "In order to meet the expectations of the townspeople, we must implement the policy of 'opposing the base and revitalizing town administration' to the end."

    Mr. Tashiro also cited the Somagahara incident as an example to illustrate the development of the Japanese people's struggle against military bases. He said that in the eleven years since the war, there have been 100,000 cases of crimes and injuries committed by the US military in Japan, and 29 people have been killed in Somagahara alone. In the past, the US military paid some money, and some incidents were settled with only 500 yen (approximately RMB 3 yuan), but this time the murder of Sakai caused a nationwide resistance movement among the Japanese people. The Japanese people will not agree unless the United States hands over the criminal Gerald.

    Mr. Tashiro said that the United States has established more than 600 military bases in Japan, and only six prefectures in Japan do not have US military bases. Now, in order to turn Japan into its atomic strategic base, the United States is stepping up the expansion of large airports, radar bases, and large fleets. The establishment of military bases by the United States in Japan threatens peace in Asia and the Pacific region, infringes upon Japan's independent sovereignty, and hinders the development of Japan's economy. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against military bases is resolute, and more and more people are participating. In the anti-base struggle in Sunagawa Town last autumn, although 2,700 people were injured, it achieved a great victory, which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the Japanese people. Currently, residents in more than 30 locations in Japan are waging tenacious struggles.

    The Japanese people's struggle against military bases is a great pressure on the US military stationed in Japan. Mr. Tashiro said that the recently announced joint US-Japan communique stated that the United States would greatly reduce the number of US troops stationed in Japan next year and would quickly withdraw US ground troops, as if it were a "gift" obtained by Nobusuke Kishi during his visit to the United States, but that is not the case. Even if Nobusuke Kishi did not go to the United States, the United States would still reduce the number of US troops stationed in Japan, which is the result of the growing struggle of the Japanese people against military bases.

    Finally, Mr. Tashiro said excitedly that the establishment of bases by the United States in Japan is not only detrimental to Japan but also to peace in the Far East. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against military bases is also conducive to peace in Asia. This is a very glorious task that must be carried through to the end!

    日本人民的光荣任务
    裴达
    两个月前，在日本茨城县小川町发生了一件轰动全国的事件——一位坚决反对军事基地的妇女当选了町长。这是现在日本全国仅有的一位女町长。这话是正在中国进行访问的只松佑治先生在记者访问他的时候讲的。
    只松先生是“日本社会党军事基地对策委员会”、“全国军事基地反对连络会议”的事务局次长。他谈起日本人民反对军事基地的斗争，特别津津有味。他说，这位妇女当选町长，是去年砂川町斗争之后，日本人民反对军事基地斗争中的又一个新的胜利。
    小川町的百里原有一个旧飞机场，日本政府打算把它改建为“自卫队”的基地。原町长幡谷仙三郎是个大财主，他赞成政府的计划，大多数町议员也表示同意。但是，小川町的妇女和青年坚决反对这个计划，并且组成了“爱町同志会”，向以町长为首的当地保守势力展开斗争。他们的口号是：“反对基地”，“刷新町政”。町长幡谷仙三郎看势不妙，就提出改选町长，并把自己作为候选人，企图用改选来加强自己的地位，达到建立军事基地的目的。他在4月21日贴出告示，要在一星期之内就投票，想以迅雷不及掩耳的方式再度掌握町政权。但是，28日改选结果完全出乎当地保守势力的预料，最热心于反对军事基地的山西女士却当选了町长。趾高气扬的原町长幡谷仙三郎以七百多票之差败北，无可奈何地交出了町政权。
    山西女士当选的消息传出后，许多参加反对基地斗争的老太婆，都高兴得相互拥抱，流下了兴奋的眼泪。农民们喜气洋洋地拿着蔬菜、粘糕到女町长家里去祝贺。一位参加反对基地斗争的六十七岁的老头藤冈二郎说：“我们要和新町长合作，像砂川町那样展开斗争”。山西女士也信心百倍地说：“为了满足町民的期望，一定要把‘反对基地、刷新町政’方针贯彻到底”。
    只松先生还以相马原事件为例，说明日本人民反对军事基地斗争的发展。他说：战后十一年来，美军在日本犯罪和伤害事件已有十万件，仅在相马原一地就有二十九人被杀害。过去美军赔些钱，有些事件只赔五百日元（约合我国人民币三元）就算没事，但是这回坂井中被杀事件引起了全日本人民的反抗运动，美国不把罪犯哲腊德交出来，日本人民就不答应。
    只松先生说：美国在日本设立军事基地有六百多处，日本全国只有六个县没有美军的基地。现在美国为把日本变成它的原子战略基地，正在加紧扩充大型机场、雷达基地和大型舰队。美国在日本建立军事基地，威胁着亚洲和太平洋地区的和平，侵犯了日本的独立主权，阻碍着日本经济的发展，因此日本人民反对军事基地的斗争是坚决的，而且参加的人越来越广泛。去年秋天砂川町反基地斗争中，虽有二千七百人受伤，却取得了很大的胜利，大大地鼓舞了日本人民的斗争情绪。现在日本有三十多个地方的居民正进行着顽强的斗争。
    日本人民反对军事基地斗争，对驻日美军是一个很大的压力。只松先生说，最近公布的日美会谈公报中说，美国要在明年内大大减少驻日美军的人数，将迅速撤退美国地面部队，好像是岸信介访美得到的“礼物”，其实不然。岸信介不去美国，美国也要减少驻日美军，这是日本人民反对军事基地斗争日益高涨的结果。
    最后，只松先生兴奋地说，美国在日本建立基地不仅对日本不利，也对远东和平不利。因此，日本人民反对军事基地的斗争，也有利于亚洲和平，这是一个十分光荣的任务，一定要进行到底！
