The People's Own Soldiers Are Forever Loyal to the People

We are representatives from various units of the People's Liberation Army and representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. We fully support the work reports made to this congress by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Premier Ulanhu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Before the opening of the congress, we studied with immense excitement Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." We unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's report is a major event in the current political life of our people, and it will inevitably play a huge role in promoting our socialist construction. Just as in the past, Chairman Mao has once again, at this great historical moment, wisely steered the helm of the revolution, correctly pointing out the direction of our advance.

Not long ago, our Party launched a rectification movement to effectively overcome bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. We believe this is very necessary. Taking our troops as an example, in recent years, some things incompatible with the glorious tradition of our army have also emerged. For example, some comrades do not sufficiently protect the interests of the masses when performing tasks, some officers do not show enough care and consideration for the lives of soldiers, and individual officers exhibit a phenomenon of detachment from the masses in their lifestyles. In this rectification movement, we will conduct in-depth inspections based on the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, further strengthen the unity between the military and the people, between officers and soldiers, and between superiors and subordinates, and overcome all non-proletarian thoughts and styles.

The despicable activities of the right-wing elements aroused the anger of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army

However, in this recent period, we have also noticed that a small handful of bourgeois right-wing elements with ulterior motives are unscrupulously carrying out despicable activities to slander the Party and the People's Government under the guise of helping the Party's rectification. They vainly attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, turn back the wheels of history, and restore capitalism. The many reactionary statements spread by the right-wing elements and their criminal activities against the Party, against the people, and against socialism have aroused the immense anger of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. When we saw in the newspapers the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements clamoring for "the Communist Party to step down" and wanting to "kill the Communist Party," we could not help but feel indignant. When we came from the borders, coasts, and various combat posts of the motherland to attend the meeting, many of our comrades repeatedly instructed us, and even during the meeting, we received letters from many comrades in the troops, including a joint letter from thirty-three comrades who had made meritorious contributions in the Battle of Shangganling, asking us to represent them at this congress to make a solemn condemnation and resolute protest against the right-wing elements. They also wanted us to express to the congress that the broad masses of officers and soldiers of our troops will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely defend the Party, defend socialism, and completely crush the rampant attack of the right-wing elements!

Communist Party members shed blood and sacrifice for the people, but the right-wing elements unscrupulously slander them

Since the day it was born, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been an armed force of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party. With the support of the people, in the past thirty years, we have experienced the world-renowned Long March, defeated Japanese imperialism with inferior equipment, and eliminated the eight million Kuomintang reactionary troops equipped by US imperialism. When US imperialism brought the flames of war to the Yalu River, our Chinese People's Volunteers again went abroad to fight, and cooperated with the Korean People's Army to drive the most ferocious US imperialism back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, making a great contribution to consolidating national security and safeguarding world peace. These victories were achieved under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Right-wing gentlemen, can you erase these historical facts? May I ask: Without the leadership of the Communist Party, would these great victories achieved by the Chinese people be possible?

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been carrying out the tasks of defending and building the motherland. When performing various tasks, the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and all revolutionary soldiers in the army have inherited the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, bravely taking on the most difficult and dangerous tasks. For the sake of the people's interests, many comrades have heroically dedicated their lives. For example, in the battle to defend Dongshan Island in July 1953, Zhang Xuedong, the squad leader and Communist Party member of our island garrison, stepped forward when the platoon leader was killed, and led the entire platoon to continue the charge. While charging towards a bunker that posed a great threat to us, he was unfortunately seriously wounded. Seeing that he was about to fall, Comrade Zhang Xuedong, a Communist Party member, used his last breath to rush to the enemy's bunker. When his bullets ran out, he used his body to block the enemy's firing hole, guaranteeing the victory of the battle with his life. Last year, floods caused disasters throughout the country, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various places risked their lives to bravely rush to rescue and provide disaster relief. When a typhoon struck the Hangzhou area, Xu Chuanhan, the quartermaster and Communist Party member of the Yu Hang garrison, and thirteen other comrades went to Zhongqiao Township to rescue the masses. Hearing cries for help, they followed the sound to search. Soldiers Wang Xilian, Gong Baolai, and Chen Kaiming jumped into the turbulent and muddy waters, rescuing forty-seven people who had fallen into the water. Later, they discovered that more than two hundred people were trapped on a collapsing building. They swam back to find a boat to rescue them, swimming back and forth in the rapids for more than five miles, fearlessly fighting for a night, and finally rescued more than two hundred people from the raging waves. Pang Liangzhao, a Communist Party member and soldier of our army stationed in Bishan County, Sichuan, sacrificed his young life to rescue the people's lives and property. In May of this year, an important highway bridge in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, was washed away by floods. Our local garrison immediately sent people to repair it by truck. At this time, new mountain torrents suddenly rolled in, and both people and vehicles were submerged in the flood. However, in order to continue to complete the task, they did not abandon the vehicles and leave. Unfortunately, in the struggle against the flood, Communist Party members Tan Youshan, Su Huaide, Li Wencheng, Li Yunfa, and Communist Youth League member Xue Baowei all gloriously sacrificed themselves in the flood.

Also, Volunteer Army Platoon Leader and Communist Party member Sun Zhanyuan was seriously wounded in the famous Battle of Shangganling, with both legs broken. He still crawled on the position, insisted on directing the troops, and used a machine gun to cover the heroic Yi Caixue's blasting. When another group of enemies rushed up from behind, he turned around alone and used machine guns and grenades to attack the enemy's charge, and pulled the last grenade and died together with the rushing enemy. Comrade Sun Zhanyuan thus shed his last drop of blood on the heroic Shangganling position, guaranteeing the victory of the counterattack.

Comrades, similar examples are countless. The heroic deeds of these Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and revolutionary soldiers have been praised by the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country will always remember them. Right-wing gentlemen, you say that Communist Party members are "all evil." Any Chinese with a little patriotic thought would never bear to use such words on them, but you did say it and you did think it. There is only one explanation for this: that is, you have lost all conscience and are used to distorting the truth, sowing discord, inciting the masses to attack the Party, vainly attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership, and opposing socialism, to achieve your ulterior and sinister goals.

The blood of the martyrs cannot be shed in vain, and the fruits of the revolution cannot be usurped

From our long-term battles, we have deeply realized that the victory of the socialist revolution in the motherland was not easily obtained. In order to win this victory, the Chinese people paid a great price. The bones of the martyrs are still left on the road of the Long March, and the heroic images of countless martyrs such as Communist Party members Chen Jinhe, Dong Cunrui, Yang Gensi, and Huang Jiguang are forever deeply engraved in our memories. Bourgeois right-wing gentlemen, can you be allowed to usurp the fruits of victory formed by the blood of these martyrs? No, absolutely not. We solemnly tell you: you are simply daydreaming, your reactionary calculations are completely wrong, and your reactionary conspiracy will never succeed. Our Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are forever the guardians of socialism. If anyone dares to sabotage our sacred socialist cause, we will, like we dealt with all counter-revolutionaries in the past, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, completely crush it and eliminate it!

A machine gunner writes to Wang Dezhou, telling him that we know who the gun should be aimed at

Right-wing gentlemen! Some of you have fantasized that the machine guns of the People's Army will be turned around to fire, which is simply a huge joke. Don't you even have the slightest understanding of the People's Liberation Army? We are the army of the people, the sons and daughters of workers and peasants, and we know who our guns should be aimed at. The Communist Party represents the interests of the people in leading us. We will aim our guns at the enemies indicated by the Party. Wherever the Party points, we will fight there, and we guarantee that we will not hit the wrong target. A machine gunner in our unit, Comrade Chen Xiuchang, recently wrote a letter to Mr. Wang Dezhou, who hopes that the gun will be turned around to fire at the Communist Party. In this letter, he said: "Mr. Wang Dezhou, I dare to guarantee to you that I am an excellent machine gunner. When the time comes, I will definitely aim at those anti-Party, anti-people, and socialist-sabotaging guys, not too high, not too low, not too left, not too right, and accurately hit their clever but confused heads."

Representatives and comrades, this is the answer of millions of machine gunners in our People's Army to those right-wing gentlemen who are daydreaming, and it is also the answer of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    人民的子弟兵永远忠于人民
    丁志辉、王兆才、王有根、王维福、江雪山、宋忠福、周文江、马春雨、崔建功、张　明、张英才、郭恩志、陆昌荣、黄丑和、杨在先、赵毛臣、赵仁虎、刘子林、刘梅村的联合发言
    我们是来自人民解放军各部队的代表和来自朝鲜的中国人民志愿军代表。我们完全拥护周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、乌兰夫副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长向这次大会所作的工作报告。
    大会开幕以前，我们以无比兴奋的心情学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，我们一致认为：毛主席这个报告是当前我国人民政治生活中的一件大事，它对我国的社会主义建设事业，必然会起到巨大的推动作用。也正像过去一样，毛主席又一次在这伟大历史性的时刻，英明的掌稳了革命的轮舵，为我们正确地指出了前进的方向。
    不久以前，我们党为了有效的克服官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，发起了整风运动，我们认为这是非常必要的。就以我们部队来说，近几年来也产生了一些与我军的光荣传统所不相容的东西。譬如：有些同志在执行任务中对群众利益爱护不够，有些军官对士兵的生活关心和体贴不够，以及个别军官在生活作风上有脱离群众的现象。我们将在这次整风运动中，根据党和毛主席的指示，进行深入的检查，进一步加强军民之间、官兵之间和上下级领导之间的团结，克服一切非无产阶级的思想和作风。
    右派分子的卑鄙活动激起了广大解放军官兵的愤怒
    但是，在最近这个时期，我们也注意到有一小撮别有用心的资产阶级右派分子，打着帮助党整风的旗号，无耻地进行诬蔑党和人民政府的卑鄙活动，他们妄想推翻共产党的领导，倒转历史的车轮，使资本主义复辟。右派分子所散布的许多反动的言论和他们所进行的反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动，已经激起了人民解放军广大官兵无比的愤怒。当我们在报纸上看到右派分子叫嚣“共产党下台”，要“杀共产党”等反动言论时，我们不能不气愤填胸。当我们从祖国的边防、海防和各种战斗工作岗位上来开会的时候，我们许多战友一再嘱咐我们，一直到开会期间，我们还接到部队许多同志的来信，其中就有三十三个在上甘岭战役立过功的同志联名来信，要我们在这次大会上代表他们向右派分子提出严正的谴责和坚决的抗议。并要我们向大会表示，我们部队广大官兵将和全国人民一道坚决保卫党、保卫社会主义，彻底打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻！
    共产党员为了人民流血牺牲  右派分子却丧尽天良污蔑他们
    我们中国人民解放军自诞生的第一天起，就是在共产党领导下的人民武装，在人民的支持下，三十年来，我们经历了举世闻名的两万五千里的长征，以劣势装备打败了日本帝国主义，消灭了美帝国主义所装备的八百万国民党反动军队；当美帝国主义把战火烧到鸭绿江边的时候，我们中国人民志愿军又出国作战，配合朝鲜人民军把最凶恶的美帝国主义赶回到三八线附近，对巩固国家安全和保卫世界和平，作出了巨大贡献。这些胜利都是在中国共产党正确的领导下取得的。右派先生们，你们能够抹煞这些历史事实吗？试问：如果没有共产党的领导，中国人民所取得的这些伟大胜利是可能的吗？
    解放以来，中国人民解放军在共产党和人民政府的领导下又执行着保卫祖国和建设祖国的任务。在执行各项任务时，军队中的共产党员、共青团员和全体革命军人都继承了人民解放军的光荣传统，勇敢地抢先担负着最艰难、最危险的任务，为了人民利益有不少的同志英勇地献出了自己的生命。例如：一九五三年七月在保卫东山岛的战斗中，我守岛部队班长共产党员张学栋，当排长牺牲时，他即挺身而出，带领全排继续冲锋，在冲向一个对我威胁很大的碉堡时，不幸身负重伤，眼看就要倒下去了，但共产党员张学栋同志却鼓着最后的一口气，冲到了敌人碉堡面前，子弹打光了，他就用自己的身体堵住了敌人的射孔，用自己的生命保证了战斗的胜利。去年，全国各地洪水为灾，我解放军驻各地部队官兵均冒生命危险奋勇抢险救灾。当台风袭击杭州地区时，余杭驻军司务长共产党员徐传涵等十三个同志到中桥乡去抢救群众，听到呼救声，就顺声寻找，士兵王希连、宫宝来、陈开明跳入大浪滔滔的浊流中，把四十七个落入水中的群众救出来，后来又发现有二百多人被水围在一个快要倒塌的楼上，他们就游水回来找船营救，在五里多路的急流中游来游去，奋不顾身，经过一夜搏斗，终于把二百多人从惊涛骇浪中救上岸来。驻四川璧山县的我军战士共产党员庞良钊就是为抢救人民的生命和财产而献出了自己年轻的生命。今年五月，广东省惠阳县一座重要公路桥梁被洪水冲塌，我当地驻军立即派人乘卡车抢修，这时突然又滚来新的山洪，人车均被浸在洪水中；但他们为了继续完成任务并没有弃车离开，不幸在和洪水搏斗中，共产党员谭友善、苏怀德、李文成、李运发及共青团员薛保卫都光荣的牺牲在洪水里。
    还有，志愿军排长共产党员孙占元同志在著名的上甘岭战役中，身负重伤，两腿都被打断，还在阵地上爬行，坚持指挥部队，并用机枪掩护英雄易才学爆破。当另一股敌人从背后冲上来时，他一个人转身用机枪、手榴弹打击敌人的冲锋，并拉响最后的一颗手榴弹和冲上来的敌人同归于尽。孙占元同志就这样在英雄的上甘岭阵地上流尽了他最后的一滴血，保证了反击战斗的胜利。
    同志们，类似的事例是数不尽举不完的。这些共产党员、共青团员和革命军人的英雄事迹受到了全国人民的赞扬，全国人民永远怀念着他们。右派先生们，你们却说共产党员是“无恶不作”。一个稍有爱国思想的中国人，决不忍心用这样的字眼加在他们头上，但你们的的确确是这样说的，也是这样想的，这只有一个解释：那就是你们丧尽天良惯会颠倒黑白，挑拨是非，煽动群众向党进攻，妄图推翻党的领导，反对社会主义，达到你们不可告人的罪恶的目的。
    烈士的鲜血不能白流  革命的果实不容篡夺
    我们从长期战斗中深深地体会到：祖国社会主义革命的胜利的取得是非常不容易的，为了争取这个胜利，中国人民付出了极大的代价。在长征的道路上还遗留着先烈的遗骨，共产党员陈金合、董存瑞、杨根思、黄继光等无数先烈的英雄形象永远深深地铭刻在我们的记忆里。资产阶级右派的先生们，难道这些烈士用鲜血结成的胜利果实能够让你们所篡夺吗？不能，绝对不能。我们严正地告诉你们：你们简直是在白天作梦，你们的反动算盘完全打错了，你们的反动阴谋是永远也不会得逞的。我们中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军永远是社会主义的卫士，如果有人胆敢破坏我们神圣的社会主义事业，我们将和过去对付一切反革命一样，同全国人民一道在党的领导下，彻底的打垮它，消灭它！
    机枪射手写信告诉王德周  我们知道枪口应该对准谁
    右派先生们！你们曾有人幻想人民军队的机关枪会倒过来打，这简直是天大的笑话，难道你们对解放军的起码的了解都没有吗？我们是人民的军队，是工农的子弟兵，我们知道我们的枪口应该对准谁。共产党代表着人民的利益在领导我们，我们将把我们的枪口对准党所指示的敌人，党指到那里我们就打到那里，而且保证不会打错目标。我们部队有个机关枪射手陈秀昌同志，最近写了一封信给希望枪口会倒过来打共产党的王德周先生，他在这封信里说：“王德周先生，我敢向你作保证，我是个优等机枪射手，到时候我一定会对准那些反党、反人民、破坏社会主义的家伙，不高不低、不左不右，准准确确地打中他那聪明而又糊涂的脑袋瓜。”
    代表同志们，这就是我们人民军队中千百万机关枪射手对那些正在作梦的右派先生们的回答，也是我们中国人民解放军和志愿军全体官兵的回答！
