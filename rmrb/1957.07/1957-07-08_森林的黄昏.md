    Forest Twilight

    At dusk, the workers finished their meal, each returning to the dormitory with a handful of wildflowers they had picked.
    I had never seen such a large kang (heated brick bed). The kang was divided into left and right rows, about thirty meters long, accommodating a hundred or so people.
    At this time, someone began to play the huqin (Chinese violin). It was a completely self-entertaining way of playing; only barely discernible “1～～3～～5,” then “5～～3～～1” tunes repeated over and over. The musician was a good-tempered, sturdy, and patient fellow, as strong as a black bear. He would often continue his playing until everyone had fallen asleep.
    I find that among my peers, there is a lack of sympathy and respect for labor in the performance or staging of music and drama; if they pay attention to listen or appreciate, it is only to pick out some faults, so they can use them as material to criticize others during tea breaks.
    Beside our lovely musician, there was no shortage of such listeners. But the reaction to the emotions aroused by the performer's skill went beyond that of my friends. They adopted an immediate method of stopping him.
      "Enough, enough, damn you, what are you playing! You don't even know the tune!" After saying that, they would reach out and grab the instrument.
    Not every musician possesses such cultivation. Over a dozen years of logging work had forged a body of iron and steel, enough to deal with the passionate emotions of listeners from any direction on the kang. As the old saying goes, the Tai Mountain collapsing in front of him does not change his expression.
    "You are just too subjective! You play whether we like it or not! It's so awful!"
      (If only a musician could come to the forest to teach songs, teach huqin playing, and play the bugle!)
    Just as the conflict couldn't be resolved, an old worker took out a copy of the "New Observer" from two years ago from the head of his bed, asking me to read an article for him.
    As soon as everyone heard that I was going to read an article, even the musician and the critics gathered around.
      "Hey, hey, Lao Huang! Read this one for us!"
    The story was about an old man who grew vegetables by Xuanwu Lake. One day, while working in the field, a burly and amiable man came and chatted with him, asking about this and that. The old man felt that this person was very familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere, but he couldn't remember for a moment.
    The man left.
    The old man suddenly remembered that he was Chairman Mao himself, the one whose picture hung on the wall. So he threw down his tools and rushed to the township government, saying that he had seen Chairman Mao with his own eyes. People said he was daydreaming, but he swore to prove that it was true...
    Just as the article was being read here, a comrade opened the door and walked in.
    "Please everyone come out for a moment. There will be heavy rain in the middle of the night, and the livestock feed in the yard hasn't been moved yet. Please come out and help..."
    Before they finished hearing the words, everyone went out, telling me to wait for them to come back before finishing the story.
    The last person to leave found that the musician hadn't left, and was turning back to the bunk to feel for his huqin again.
    "Hey? What's up, kid! Just because the straw doesn't belong to your family, you won't move it?"
    The musician jumped up like a spring and went out too.
    So everyone moved a pile of straw. Each bundle weighed eighty or ninety catties, and they had to walk two hundred meters, climb a small slope, pile it up, and cover it with mats.
    As soon as the mats were covered, the rain fell.
      "Look!" someone said.
    Everyone returned to the dormitory, changing clothes and wiping sweat, and urged me to finish the story.
    I said that the story was finished, and the book said it was a legend, so it might not be accurate.
      "How could it not be accurate? It must be that Chairman Mao visited Xuanwu Lake. How could it not be accurate?" a young man said.
    Another young man said:
      "This is so interesting! If I saw Chairman Mao, I really wouldn't know what to do!"
    The musician also said:
      "What to do? What's there to do? Go forward and shake hands! I would report to him, and I would say, 'Chairman Mao! Our life isn't bad!'"
    "Ha!" The young man who had told him to get off the kang immediately retorted: "Are you worthy? What big talk! 'Report'? Look at how lazy you were lying on the kang just now, are you worthy of 'reporting'?"
      "If Chairman Mao walked in from the door right now—"
    Everyone subconsciously glanced towards the door.
      "Comrades! How do you do!" The young man imagined Chairman Mao speaking: "I saw you moving the public straw just now. -- How would you 'report'?"
    The musician became nervous:
      "Me? I moved twenty bundles!..."
    "That's right!" Old Wu, squatting on the head of the kang, said: "It was twenty bundles, this kid is not bad!"

    森林的黄昏
    黄永玉
    黄昏时分，工人们吃过饭，各人手里都采了满满一把野花回宿舍里来。
    我从来没见过那样大的炕。炕分左右两排，长约三十咪，可住百十来人。
    这时候，拉胡琴的开始了。这完全是一种自得其乐的拉法；只在勉强听得出来的“1～～3～～5，”然后是“5～～3～～1”的音调上来来去去。琴手是一位脾气特好、结实得像条黑熊似的、有耐性的人物。他常常把这种演奏一直继续到大伙睡觉之后才肯罢手。
    我发现在朋辈之间，对于音乐戏剧的演奏或演出，都缺乏一种同情和对劳动的尊重；他们如果注意倾听或欣赏，那不过只是为了挑剔出一些毛病，好在茶余酒后作为臧否别人的材料。
    在我们这位可爱的琴手旁边，这样的听众也不缺乏。但对于演奏者的手艺所引起的情绪的反映，却超乎我的朋友之上。他们采用的是即时的制止的手法。
      “算了，算了，你娘的拉甚么琴啦！连调门儿还不会！”说完动手便来抢琴。
    并不是任何演奏家都具备这样的修养的。十几年来的采伐工作锻炼出一付铜筋铁骨，使他足以对付来自炕上任何方面的听众激昂情绪。正如古话所说，泰山崩于前而面不改色。
    “你简直太主观嘛！不管我们爱不爱听你就拉！多难听啦！”
      （要有位音乐家来森林教教歌曲，教拉琴吹号多好？）
    正在矛盾不能解决的时候，一位老工人从床头掏出一本前两年的新观察来。要我读一篇文章给他听。
    大伙儿一听见我要读文章，便连那一位演奏家和那几位批评家都围拢来了。
      “哪，哪，老黄！你给我们来这一篇！”
    故事大概说玄武湖边有一个种菜的老人，一天，正在地里干活的时候，走来一个魁伟而和气的人，和他聊天，问长问短。老人觉得这人很面善，仿佛那儿见过，只是一时记不上来。
    那人走了。
    老人忽然想起他就是墙上挂着的像片毛主席本人，于是扔了家伙，急急忙忙奔到乡政府，说他亲眼见到了毛主席了。人家说他做白日梦，他则发誓证明真有这回事情……
    文章正读到这里，一位同志开门走进来了。
    “请大伙儿出来一下，半夜有大雨，场子的牲口料草还没搬完，麻烦出来干干……”
    大伙没听说完话就都出门去了，关照我等他们回来之后才能把故事读完。
    最后出去的人发现演奏家还没有走，正反身到铺上又去摸他的琴。
    “咦？怎嘛小子！稻草不是你家的就不搬哪？”
    演奏家弹簧似的跳起来，也出门去了。
    于是大伙儿就搬了一通稻草。每捆足有八十来斤，还得走两百来咪的路，爬一个小斜坡，还得堆起来，再盖上席子。
    席子刚盖妥，雨就下了。
      “你看！”有人说。
    大伙儿重新回到宿舍里，一边换衣擦汗，一边就催我把故事说完。
    我说，故事已经完了，书上写着这是传说，保不定准的。
      “咋不准？一定是毛主席到过玄武湖了，那那儿会不准？”一个小伙子说。
    另一个小伙子说：
      “这多有意思呀！要是我见到毛主席，真说不上该咋办了！”
    演奏家也说了：
      “咋办？有啥咋办？上前握手嘛！我就向他汇报，我说‘毛主席呀！咱们的日子不坏呀！’”
    “喝！”刚才叫他下炕的小伙子马上反驳：“你配？好大口气，嘿！‘汇报’？瞧你刚才赖在炕上那付懒劲，你配‘汇报’？”
      “要是毛主席这时候从门外走进来了——”
    大伙下意识地朝着门外一瞧。
      “同志们！你们好！”小伙子设想着毛主席在说话：“刚才你们搬公家的稻草，我看见了。——你咋‘汇报’？”
    演奏家紧张起来：
      “我？我搬了二十捆！……”
    “没错！”蹲在炕头的老吴头说：“是二十捆，这小子不赖！”
