I completely agree with Premier Zhou and the reports of all the leaders. Now I will only express some opinions on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

Recently, many non-Party friends, in order to help the Communist Party rectify its work, put forward many valuable opinions and useful criticisms to the Party in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. But during this period of "great blooming" and "great contending," the bourgeois rightists, thinking that the time had come, took off their masks of supporting the Communist Party and supporting socialism, exposed their ugly faces of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, and launched a frantic attack on the Party. An important target of their attack was the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries led by the Party. Some of them said, "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a mess," "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries wrongly accused so many good people," and some said, "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a needless worry," "Achievements are out of the question, shortcomings and mistakes are the main thing." After creating these confusing and black-and-white arguments, they proposed to organize a "Rehabilitation Committee." Their purpose is very clear: to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, to oppose socialism, and to oppose the people's democratic dictatorship. The broad masses of cadres, workers and staff in Hebei Province, like workers, peasants and progressive intellectuals all over the country, expressed great indignation at these reactionary remarks. Many staff members of the organs said: "We don't need this kind of people to look at our achievements, just let him look at the facts is enough." Some of the masses said: "Aren't these gentlemen speaking for the counter-revolutionaries?" Was the anti-counter-revolutionary movement a mess? Or was it done very well? In order to refute the rightists' slanders, let me introduce to you some information about the anti-counter-revolutionary movement in our Hebei Province.

The anti-counter-revolutionary movement in Hebei Province started in July 1955. Now, except for a few areas and a few units that are still under investigation, from the perspective of the entire province, the anti-counter-revolutionary movement has basically ended. According to the cases that have been finalized so far: a total of 6,061 counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements have been investigated and identified. The investigation and identification of more than 6,000 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in Hebei Province's organs, enterprises, schools, and organizations is a major event and a great victory for all of us who support socialism. This victory has purified the revolutionary organizations, further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and effectively safeguarded the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The Living Facts Show the Necessity of Carrying Out the Anti-Counter-Revolutionary Movement

Recalling the initial stage of launching the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, it was at the eve of the great high tide of the socialist revolution, at a critical juncture of who would defeat whom, and the class struggle was extremely sharp. Those counter-revolutionaries who hated socialism and hated the people were not reconciled to their defeat. In order to hinder the progress of the socialist cause, they did everything possible to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, either openly or secretly. Taking the destructive accidents that occurred in factories, mines, enterprises, infrastructure construction, and finance and trade systems as an example, in 1954 it increased by more than 25 percent compared to 1953; in the first half of 1955, it increased by 40 percent compared to the first half of 1954. These counter-revolutionaries who were frantically sabotaging socialist transformation and socialist construction included not only counter-revolutionaries with general historical crimes, but also murderers with heinous crimes and bloody debts, known by the people as "living skinners" and "living yamens"; not only were there secret agents and spies who were deeply hidden and cleverly active, but also small counter-revolutionary groups that developed organizations within our organs, enterprises, schools, and other systems to carry out anti-Communist and anti-people activities. Here, I can give a few examples to illustrate: For example, Tian Tieping, a Kuomintang military intelligence agent who was investigated and identified in the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture, infiltrated the Tonghua Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Justice in 1945, actively collected information from our side, and on February 3, 1946, under the planning and instigation of the Kuomintang intelligence agency, created the Tonghua riot incident, which resulted in nearly a hundred casualties among cadres and the masses. After the riot was quelled by us, Tian also reported the captured rioters and the casualties on both sides to his superior intelligence agency. Until the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, this ferocious counter-revolutionary still hid five pistols. Guan Renqian, a counter-revolutionary element investigated and identified from middle school teachers in Fengrun County, served as the chief and section chief of the police bureau during the Japanese puppet period. After Japan surrendered, he recruited stubborn puppet personnel in the Northeast to establish the Special Commissioner Headquarters of the Provincial Government of Hegang, and served as the deputy commissioner, directing his subordinates to assassinate Sun Xilin, the mayor of Jiamusi City, and Gao Yingjie, the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau. This counter-revolutionary murderer, who had been wanted for a long time without success, was also investigated and identified in the anti-counter-revolutionary movement.

Feng Ruxian, a hidden counter-revolutionary element in Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant, accepted the task of lurking from the Central Statistics Bureau's secret service organization on the eve of liberation. He lurked in the factory under the pretext of organizing a factory protection team to establish a communication group, and actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities. In the spring of 1955, just as socialist construction was entering a high tide, he actively created a destructive accident that damaged the windmill shaft, and conspired with another counter-revolutionary element, Feng Dezhong, who was lurking in the plant, to instruct their partners to steal the plant's "Badas" highly toxic poison, plotting to sprinkle it in the food and poison Chang Qingxing, the secretary of the workshop branch. Fortunately, their conspiracy was discovered in time, and our branch secretary was spared the counter-revolutionary poison.

In the process of socialist revolution, a small number of elements in the exploiting classes who resisted transformation, due to their inherent class nature, were extremely dissatisfied with the socialist system, and finally developed into counter-revolutionaries who were enemies of the people. These newly grown counter-revolutionaries deserve our serious attention. Yu Xilin, a primary school teacher in Chengde City, is such a typical example. He was the son of a landlord and counter-revolutionary element who was struggled against. From May 24 to June 21, 1955, he successively sent four threatening letters: In the letter he wrote to the Secretary of the Chengde Municipal Party Committee, he said: "After listening to your report on opposing the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in Chengde City, I am even more resentful of you... I tell you, if you continue to criticize the Hu Feng organization, I am afraid you are in danger... We must avenge the martyrs, eliminate the Communist Party, and fight to Beijing." From these few words, it can be seen that the exploiting classes are not reconciled to their demise, and they want to carry out a life-and-death struggle with us. Isn't this obvious enough?

With the existence of imperialism and the Kuomintang in Taiwan, the enemy's conspiracy to send secret agents and spies will not stop. Zhang Meisheng, who was investigated and identified in the affiliated hospital of the Zhangjiakou Medical School, was a special agent who accepted the task of the "Sino-American Joint Work Headquarters." Under the guise of medical personnel, he tried every means to collect information on our military and political organs, facilities, airports, and various aspects of the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements.

Aren't the above-mentioned living facts enough to show that we must launch an anti-counter-revolutionary movement to investigate and identify these counter-revolutionaries? Isn't the rightists' so-called "suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a needless worry" defending these counter-revolutionaries? The rightists' opposition to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is ill-intentioned, isn't it clear? Those who clamorously oppose the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, attempting to exaggerate shortcomings and mistakes and obliterate the great achievements of the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, are shaking the fruits of the revolution; obviously, these people do not represent the interests of the broad masses of the people. On the contrary, they are the remnants of the overthrown ruling class, extremely hate the people's democratic dictatorship, and are a manifestation of the illusion of restoration.

The Necessity of Mobilizing the Broad Masses to Investigate and Identify Counter-Revolutionaries

The anti-counter-revolutionary struggle was carried out in the form of a mass movement. The mass line is the fundamental line of our work, and of course it is also the fundamental line for us to do a good job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It is precisely because we have done this that the socialist consciousness of the broad masses and their ability to distinguish counter-revolutionaries have been greatly improved. The broad masses have actively exposed and reported counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the entire province received more than 90,000 pieces of materials on large and small problems exposed and reported by the masses. With this batch of materials, we were able to investigate and identify a batch of counter-revolutionaries more smoothly. For example, Song Guangbi, a female teacher at Tongxian Women's Normal School, was cleverly disguised and had already won the title of "Model Teacher." It was only after the masses exposed and verified that he was the acting secretary-general of the Kuomintang Heilongjiang Province and the secretary of the Harbin Special Party Department. Another example is Li Zhaoxi, a teacher in Zhuoxian County, who once pretended to be an activist in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It was only after the masses exposed and verified that he was an agent of the Central Statistics Bureau. Facts show that if we do not mobilize and rely on the active support of the broad masses, and only rely on specialized organs to work in isolation, it would be impossible to isolate and expose counter-revolutionaries so quickly in such a short period of time, and it would be impossible to achieve such great achievements at all. The method of mobilizing the broad masses to investigate and identify counter-revolutionaries can also avoid the "left" or right mistakes that are prone to occur when only a few people from specialized organs are relied upon to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Even if some mistakes do occur, they are easier to detect and correct. Not to mention the benefits of the masses being tempered through struggle and improving their vigilance. Therefore, those who oppose mobilizing the masses to engage in the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle either do not recognize the great power of the broad masses, or are actually unwilling to carry out the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle thoroughly.

Helping a Large Number of People Clarify Their History and Lay Down Their Burdens

In the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, we also clarified the political and historical situation of a large number of personnel, helped them lay down their burdens, and made conclusions separately. According to incomplete statistics from the entire province, more than 90,000 people have confessed to the organization various political and historical problems that they had concealed. This is a big gain. This is of great significance for distinguishing the enemy from ourselves, expanding the scope of our unity, exposing and isolating counter-revolutionaries, and mobilizing positive factors.

After the national liberation, our Party has carried out tremendous work of unity, education, and transformation of a large number of old intellectuals and old personnel, and has achieved great success. However, a few people, because they concealed their participation in reactionary organizations, had relations with counter-revolutionary organizations, or had political relations with counter-revolutionaries, or usually had counter-revolutionary remarks, when the organization had not yet clarified these problems, it was very easy to affect the better unity and use of them. Whenever a movement arrived, these people were often implicated because the boundary between the enemy and ourselves was unclear. Some people carried a historical burden, were wary of the revolutionary organization, had estrangement, and had low work morale, forming a so-called backward layer in the organs. Precisely because they had such political and historical stains, they often became the target of enemy exploitation and activities, and they were easily fooled by counter-revolutionaries. Such facts have been exposed a lot in the movement. How to make these people draw a clear line, lay down their burdens, expand the scope of our unity, reduce the enemy's activity base, and block the loopholes for counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities is an urgent problem to be solved. This anti-counter-revolutionary movement has solved this problem. After their problems were clarified and correct conclusions were made on them, they laid down their burdens, and many people's political motivation was unprecedentedly improved, and they expressed gratitude to the Party and the government. For example, Kong Fangzhai from Shahe County said: "I originally neither agreed with the Kuomintang nor agreed with the Communist Party, because I thought that the Communist Party would never believe me. Now I realize the Party's concern and love for the people, and I am determined to dedicate my old age to socialism." Another example is Yuan Ziliang from the Fengfeng City Culture and Education System, whose suspicion of blood debt was denied after investigation. Yuan said gratefully: "The Communist Party is so wise, my problem could not be clarified without the leadership of the Communist Party." In short, this eliminated some negative factors that existed before and mobilized them to the positive side. This is the fundamental and positive aspect of the movement. Of course, some people have been struggled against in the movement, and some have even been struggled against more severely, which once hurt their feelings, but we believe that after the necessary explanation work, they will understand these reasons, and they will be closer to the Party.

The Broad Masses Have Improved Their Political Awareness in the Movement

In the past few years, all aspects of our work have been in the process of rapid development. Due to the weakness of political and ideological work in some organs, the existence of right-leaning paralysis thinking, and the tendency of not asking about politics, the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie has found a market in some corners of the organs, and even some counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have openly spread reactionary ideas in the organs. We were paralyzed and did not notice this enough. In the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, the broad masses improved their awareness, sharpened their eyes, exposed some so-called "dark corners" inside the organs, and discovered some reactionary rogue cliques. These small cliques have played a great role in corrupting and sabotaging our revolutionary ranks. They spread reactionary ideas; some win over the backward, attack the progressive, and confront the leadership; some have a two-faced attitude, take advantage of weaknesses, create rumors, sow discord, and stir up trouble; some develop low-level tastes, pursue vulgar lives, and use the bourgeois way of life to corrupt cadres. From the experience of struggle, it can be seen that these small group activities have been welcomed by the enemy, and some have been organized by counter-revolutionaries. We did find counter-revolutionaries in the struggle to expose these small cliques. For example, the "Social Revolutionary Party" reactionary organization headed by Chen Liuxing, a reactionary landlord and counter-revolutionary offspring, in the former North China Geological Bureau of Zhangjiakou City, had developed seven members from 1954 to July 1955. Its members included counter-revolutionary offspring, people who had made mistakes, and other ideologically backward elements. Of course, not all members of these small cliques are counter-revolutionaries, but most of the core members of the small cliques are counter-revolutionaries or bad elements. It is very necessary to give serious criticism to these reactionary rogue cliques. This has played a great role in improving mass awareness, enhancing internal unity, combating evil spirits, and promoting righteousness.

In short, the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle was a great historical victory. It investigated and identified counter-revolutionaries, purified the revolutionary ranks, and enabled the broad masses to receive a practical class struggle exercise, improve their awareness, and accumulate experience. Therefore, the result of the movement greatly consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship and further guaranteed the smooth development of socialist construction.

Some Deviations and Errors Did Occur in Specific Work

As mentioned above, the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle was completely necessary, the achievements were great, and the development of the movement was basically healthy. This correct conclusion cannot be overturned no matter what. Of course, while affirming the achievements, we must also see that some deviations and errors did occur in specific work. The main thing was that during the high tide of the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle in the autumn of 1955, some areas and units once had a deviation of an overly broad struggle surface, and wrongly struggled against a small number of good people, which accounted for about 5% of the anti-counter-revolutionary investigation targets at that time in the entire province. The phenomenon of wrongly struggling against good people in the 1956 movement was greatly reduced, and the units that carried out the movement this year have basically eliminated this situation.

There was also such a situation in the movement that some people themselves did have some problems, and the masses had some doubts and dissatisfaction with their behavior. After the masses were mobilized, these people were investigated or struggled against. Although the final decision was not to be regarded as counter-revolutionaries, it was appropriate to investigate or struggle against them. In order to facilitate understanding of the situation at that time, I can give two such examples: Sun Rulin, an assistant technician at Huaxin Textile Factory in Shijiazhuang City, participated in the counter-revolutionary organization "Three People's Principles for National Construction Party" in Tangshan Middle School in 1950. In 1951, the case was cracked and Sun fled. Later, he concealed his history and mixed into the revolutionary camp. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, with the help of the mass group, he confessed this problem. When the final decision was made, considering that Sun was still young at the time (16 years old) and was not a core member of the organization, and there were no other activities after participating in work, he was not treated as a counter-revolutionary. Another example is Zhou Jingchai, an editor at the Provincial People's Publishing House, who fabricated history, spread backward remarks at work, openly defended Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary crimes at the beginning of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and wrote anonymous letters scolding the editorial department of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, so he was once identified as an anti-counter-revolutionary investigation target and was struggled against by the masses. After repeated investigation and verification, these people were truthfully and appropriately concluded. Isn't this beneficial to the country and to themselves? In the mass movement, is it inappropriate for these people to be investigated or struggled against?

Of course, wrongly struggling against good people did bring certain side effects to the movement, hurt some people's feelings, and caused some bad influences, which should be fully recognized. But once this mistake was discovered, we corrected it, and some are still conducting in-depth and repeated inspections and taking various measures for follow-up work. We believe that the dissatisfaction caused by this mistake can be completely eliminated, and some of the adverse consequences can be completely compensated for.

In our work, there are also mistakes of omission. Some units did not fully mobilize the masses, or the investigation and research work was not meticulous and in-depth, so that a small number of deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries were not investigated and identified. In the great blooming and great contending, a small number of counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to stir up trouble, which further confirmed this situation. We are also taking necessary measures in this regard to thoroughly carry out the anti-counter-revolutionary struggle.

If There Are Counter-Revolutionaries, They Must Be Suppressed; If There Are Mistakes, They Must Be Corrected

In order to thoroughly correct the shortcomings and errors in our anti-counter-revolutionary movement and better consolidate the results, according to the principle of "if there are counter-revolutionaries, they must be suppressed" and "if there are mistakes, they must be corrected," and according to the instructions of the Central Committee, our province proposed the re-examination and follow-up work in April 1956, and successively held several special meetings to specifically deploy it, emphasizing that leading cadres personally read the files, clarify the nature of the problem, and ensure that the decisions are based on evidence and the handling is appropriate, emphasizing the timely handling of appeals and making a realistic and appropriate conclusion. Then, according to different situations, they were handled separately. In addition to handing over counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to the judicial organs for handling according to law, those good people who were wrongly struggled against in the movement were sincerely apologized to separately, restored their reputation, and obtained their understanding. Facts have proved that even if relatively serious shortcomings and errors occurred in individual areas and units in the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, once re-examined, the shortcomings and errors have been corrected and the losses have been compensated. I would also like to state that in several re-examinations and follow-up work, not only were wrong cases found, but also some counter-revolutionaries who had been missed were found. Therefore, while resolutely correcting shortcomings and errors, we must still implement the spirit of suppressing counter-revolutionaries if there are any, and we must not be paralyzed in the slightest. Those rightists with ulterior motives seize on the errors and shortcomings of individual cases, exaggerate them one-sidedly, and attempt to draw the conclusion from individual and minority facts that the anti-counter-revolutionary movement was a mess, thereby achieving the vicious purpose of negating the great achievements of the anti-counter-revolutionary movement and shaking the people's democratic dictatorship. But this is just the rightists' dream, and their argument cannot withstand refutation, because they have neither a factual basis nor a mass basis. Their materials and its sources are suspicious, and they are speaking for counter-revolutionaries from a position of anti-people and anti-socialism. Chairman Mao instructed us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Some people do not understand that our policies today are suitable for today's situation, and the past policies are suitable for the past situation. They want to use today's policies to overturn past cases, and want to deny the great achievements of the past suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This is completely wrong and is not allowed by the people." We solemnly warn those rightists who attack the anti-counter-revolutionary movement that they should receive education from Chairman Mao's instructions and thoroughly change their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-people's democratic dictatorship stance.

In order to do a better job in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and continue to correct the errors of both wrong and missed, we warmly support Chairman Mao's proposal that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC preside over a comprehensive inspection of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries this year or next year, which will be of great benefit to improving our work, correctly handling counter-revolutionaries, and improving our legal system.

    肃反斗争是一次历史性的伟大胜利
    马卓洲介绍河北肃反运动情况驳斥右派谰言
    我完全同意周总理和各位首长的报告，现在我仅就肃反问题发表一点意见。
    最近时期，许多党外朋友，为了帮助共产党的整风，本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，向党提出了很多宝贵意见和有益的批评。但就在这个“大放”“大鸣”的时候，资产阶级右派分子，自以为时机已经到来，于是他们揭下了拥护共产党、拥护社会主义的假面具，暴露了他们反对共产党、反对社会主义的丑恶面孔，向党展开了猖狂的进攻。他们攻击的一个重要目标，就是党所领导的肃反运动。他们有的讲：“肃反搞糟了”，“肃反不知冤枉了多少好人”，有的讲：“肃反是庸人自扰”，“成绩谈不到，缺点错误是主要的”。他们制造了这些混淆是非、颠倒黑白的议论之后，提出了要组织一个什么“平反委员会”。他们的目的是十分清楚的，就是反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，不要人民民主专政。对于这些反动议论，河北省的广大干部职工群众同全国各地的工人、农民和进步知识分子一样表现了极大的愤慨，许多机关工作人员说：“我们不需要这种人看我们的成绩，只让他看看事实就够了”，有的群众说：“这些先生们难道不是在替反革命说话吗？”肃反运动究竟是搞糟了？还是搞得很好呢？为了驳斥右派分子的谰言，让我在这里给大家介绍我们河北省的肃反运动的一些情况。
    河北省的肃反运动是从一九五五年七月开始的。现在除少数地区和少数单位尚在继续清查外，从全省范围来看，肃反运动已经基本结束。就目前已经定案的来说：清查出反革命分子及其他坏分子共六千零六十一名。在河北省的机关、企业、学校、团体中清查出六千多名反革命分子和坏分子，对于我们一切拥护社会主义的人来说，都是一件大事情，都是一个巨大胜利。这个胜利，使革命组织纯洁了，人民民主专政更加巩固了，有力地保卫了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的顺利前进。
    活生生的事实说明了开展肃反运动的必要
    回忆发动肃反运动的初期，当时正处在伟大的社会主义革命高潮的前夜，处在谁战胜谁的重要关头，阶级斗争是异常尖锐的。那些仇视社会主义、仇视人民的反革命分子，并没有甘心他们的失败，为了阻碍社会主义事业的前进，他们千方百计地或明或暗的进行着各种阴谋破坏活动，以厂矿企业、基建、财贸系统发生的破坏事故而论，一九五四年比一九五三年就上升了百分之二十五强；一九五五年上半年又比一九五四年上半年上升了百分之四十。这些对社会主义改造和社会主义建设进行疯狂破坏的反革命分子，不仅有一般历史罪恶的反革命分子，而且有人民群众称之为“活剥皮”、“活阎王”等罪恶昭彰、血债累累的杀人罪魁；不仅有隐蔽较深、活动巧妙的派遣进来和潜伏下来的特务间谍分子，还有在我们机关、企业、学校等系统内部发展组织进行反共反人民活动的反革命小集团。这里可以顺便举出如下几个例子来加以说明：如河北省农业厅清查出来的国民党军统特务田铁平，一九四五年打入了我通化专署司法科后，即曾积极搜集我方情报，并于一九四六年二月三日，在国民党特务机关的策划和指使下制造了通化暴动事件，伤亡干部群众近百名，暴动被我平息后，田还将我俘虏的暴徒和敌我伤亡情况向其上级特务机关作了报告。直到肃反运动中，这个凶恶的反革命分子，还隐藏着手枪五支。丰润县从中学教员中清查出一个反革命分子关任千，日伪时期曾当过警察局的股长、科长，日本投降后，又在东北笼络顽伪人员成立合江省府特派专员本部，任副专员，指挥其部下刺杀了我佳木斯市市长孙西林和公安局副局长高英杰同志，这一个长期追捕未获的反革命杀人犯，也是在肃反运动中清查出来的。
    唐山启新水泥厂有一个暗藏反革命分子冯汝贤，在解放前夕接受了中统特务组织的潜伏任务，埋伏在工厂里以组织护厂队建立通讯小组为名，积极进行反革命活动。一九五五年春天，正当社会主义建设进入高潮之际，他积极制造旋坏了风车轴的破坏事故，又同潜藏在该厂的另一反革命分子冯德忠策划、指示他们的伙伴偷出了本厂“八代斯”烈性毒药，阴谋撒在饭菜中，毒害车间支部书记常庆兴等人，由于被及时发觉，破坏了他们的阴谋，我们的支部书记才免遭反革命的毒手。
    在社会主义革命进程中，剥削阶级中少数抵抗改造的分子，由于固有的阶级本性，对社会主义制度极端不满，终于发展成为与人民为敌的反革命分子。新生长的这些反革命值得我们严重注意。承德市小学教员于锡麟就是这样一个典型。他是被斗地主和反革命分子的子弟，从一九五五年五月二十四日至六月二十一日即先后发出恫吓信四封：他写给承德市委书记的信中说：“听了你在承德市作的关于反对胡风反革命集团的报告，使我对你更加愤恨……我告诉你，你再痛骂胡风组织，恐怕你有危险……，我们要为先烈复仇，消灭共产党，打到北京去”，从这几句话里可以看出剥削阶级不甘心自己的灭亡，并且要向我们进行你死我活的斗争，这难道还不明显吗？
    有帝国主义存在、有台湾的国民党存在，敌人派遣特务间谍的阴谋活动就不会停止。张家口市医士学校附属医院清查出来的张玫生，就是接受了“中美联合工作总部”任务的一个特务分子，挂着医务人员的招牌，曾千方百计地搜集我军政机关设施、飞机场以及“三反”、“五反”、“镇反”运动等各个方面的情报。
    以上这些活生生的事实，还不足以说明我们必须展开肃反运动来把这些反革命分子加以清查吗？右派分子的所谓“肃反是庸人自扰”不正是替这些反革命分子辩护又是什么呢？右派分子反对肃反，其居心不良，不是明明白白的吗？那些口口声声反对肃反运动的人，企图夸大缺点错误，抹煞肃反运动的巨大成绩，动摇革命的成果；显然，这些人并不是代表广大人民群众的利益，相反，是被推翻的统治阶级的残余，极端仇恨人民民主专政，并且幻想复辟的一种表现。
    动员广大群众清查反革命的必要性
    肃反斗争是采取群众运动的形式进行的。群众路线，是我们工作的根本路线，当然也是我们搞好肃反工作的根本路线。正是由于我们这样做的结果，才大大提高了广大群众的社会主义觉悟和对反革命分子的辨别能力，广大群众积极起来揭发检举反革命分子，因而，全省收到了经群众揭发检举的大小问题的材料达九万多件，有了这批材料，我们才较为顺利的清查出一批反革命分子。例如通县女师教员宋光弼，由于伪装的巧妙，已经骗取了“模范教员”的称号，就是经群众揭发和查证，才弄清他是国民党黑龙江省代理书记长和哈尔滨市特别党部书记长的。又如涿县教员李肇熙，还曾一度伪装为肃反积极分子，也是经过群众揭发和查证，才弄清了他是一个中统特务分子。事实说明，如果不发动依靠广大群众的积极支持，只靠专门机关孤立的来工作，在这样短的时间，反革命分子就不可能这样迅速地被孤立和暴露出来，要取得这样巨大的成绩是根本不可能的。动员广大群众清查反革命的方法，还可以避免只靠专门机关少数人员去肃反容易发生的“左”的或右的错误，即使发生了某些错误也比较容易发现和纠正。更不用说群众通过斗争锻炼，提高了警惕性这方面的好处了。因此，那种反对发动群众搞肃反斗争的人，不是不承认广大人民群众的巨大力量，就是实际上不愿意把肃反斗争进行彻底。
    帮助大批人员查清了历史卸下了包袱
    在肃反运动中，我们还查清了一大批人员的政治历史情况，帮助他们放下了包袱，分别作出了结论。据全省不完全统计，有九万多人向组织上坦白交代了自己隐瞒的各种政治问题和历史问题。这是一个很大的收获。这对分清敌我界限，扩大我们团结范围，暴露和孤立反革命，调动积极因素都有重大意义。
    全国解放后，我们党对于大批的旧知识分子与旧人员进行了巨大的团结、教育和改造的工作，收到了伟大成绩。但有少数人因为隐瞒了他们参加过反动组织，同反革命组织有过关系，或同反革命分子有过政治关系，或平素有反革命言论，当组织上还未查清他们这些问题时，就极易影响着对他们更好的团结使用。每当运动到来，常常因为这些人的敌我界限不清，而牵挂了他们。有一些人则背着历史包袱，对革命组织怀有戒心，存有隔阂，工作情绪不高，在机关中形成了一个所谓落后层。而正因为他们有这样、那样政治上历史上的污点，也就常常成为敌人利用活动的对象，他们也就容易上反革命分子的当。这样的事实在运动中揭发了不少，如何使这些人划清界限，放下包袱，扩大我们的团结范围，缩小敌人的活动基础，堵塞反革命分子进行破坏活动的漏洞，是急待解决的问题。这次肃反运动把这一问题解决了。当查清了他们的问题，对他们作出正确的结论后，使他们放下了包袱，很多人政治进取心空前提高，对党和政府表示感激。如沙河县孔芳斋说：“我原来既不赞成国民党，也不赞成共产党，因为我认为共产党什么时候也不会相信我。现在我才认识到党对人民的关怀与爱护，我决心把晚年贡献给社会主义。”再如峰峰市文教系统袁子良的血债嫌疑，经查清予以否定后，袁感激的说：“共产党真英明，我的问题不是在共产党的领导下是不能弄清的。”总之，这样就消除了以前存在的一些消极因素，调动到积极方面来。这是运动中根本的积极的方面。当然有些人在运动中曾经被斗争过，有的还斗得厉害了一些，一度伤了感情，但我们相信，经过必要的解释工作，他们是会明白这些道理的，他们是会更加向党靠拢的。
    广大群众在运动中提高了政治觉悟
    几年来，我们各方面的工作都是处在迅速发展的过程中，由于某些机关政治思想工作薄弱，存在右倾麻痹思想和不问政治倾向，使资产阶级的思想影响在机关的某些角落中找到了市场，甚至一些反革命分子和坏分子在机关中公开散布反动思想。对此，我们平时麻痹，觉察不够，在肃反运动中广大群众提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，揭露了机关内部的一些所谓“阴暗角落”，发现了一些反动的流氓的小集团。这些小集团在我们革命队伍中起了很大的腐蚀与破坏作用。他们散布反动思想；有的拉拢落后，打击进步，对抗领导；有的两面态度，利用弱点，制造流言蜚语，挑拨离间，兴风作浪；有的发展低级趣味，追求下流生活，以资产阶级的生活方式来腐蚀干部。从斗争的经验中可以看出，这些小集团活动曾是敌人欢迎的，有的就是反革命分子组织的。我们在揭发这些小集团的斗争中，从中也确实找到了反革命，比如：张家口市原华北地质局以反动地主反革命子弟陈柳星为首的“社会革命党”反动组织，自一九五四年到一九五五年七月已发展了七人，其成员有反革命子弟，也有犯过错误的及其他思想落后的分子。当然，这些小集团的成员不都是反革命，但小集团的骨干分子多数却是反革命分子或坏分子。对这些反动的流氓的小集团活动，给以严肃的批判，这是非常必要的。这对提高群众觉悟，增进内部团结，打击邪气，提高正气，都起了很大作用。
    总之，肃反斗争是一次历史性的伟大胜利，清查了反革命分子，纯洁了革命队伍，使广大群众受到了一次实际的阶级斗争的锻炼，提高了觉悟，积累了经验，因而运动的结果，大大地巩固了人民民主专政，进一步保障了社会主义建设事业的顺利发展。
    具体工作中确实发生过一些偏差和错误
    如上所述，肃反斗争是完全必要的，成绩是巨大的，运动的发展基本上是健康的。这个正确的论断，是无论怎样也推翻不了的。当然，在肯定成绩的同时，我们还必须看到在具体工作上确实是发生过一些偏差和错误的，主要是在一九五五年秋天肃反斗争的高潮时期，部分地区和单位，曾经一度产生过斗争面过宽的偏差，错斗了少数好人，就全省来说，大约占当时的肃反清查对象百分之五左右。一九五六年的运动，错斗好人的现象就大大减少了，今年开展运动的单位，基本上杜绝了这种情况。
    在运动中还有这样的情形，有一些人本身确实存有一些问题，群众对他们的行为有所怀疑和不满，在群众发动起来之后这些人受到清查或斗争，虽然最后定案不算反革命分子，但清查或斗争他们是应当的。为了便于了解当时的情况，我可以举出这样两个例子：石家庄市华新纺织厂助理技术人员孙汝林，一九五○年在唐山中学时曾参加反革命组织“三民主义建国党”，一九五一年该案被破获，孙潜逃。后来隐瞒历史混入革命阵营，肃反中经群众小组帮助，交代了这一问题，最后定案时，考虑当时孙年纪还小（十六岁）又不是该组织的骨干分子，参加工作后再无其他活动，不以反革命分子论处。又如省人民出版社的编辑周敬侪，因伪造历史，工作中散布落后言论，肃反开始时公开为胡风的反革命罪行辩护，并写匿名信谩骂省文联编辑部，因而一度被确定为肃反清查对象并且被群众斗争了。这些人经过反复查证，甄别定案，最后都实事求是的做出了恰当的结论。这对国家对他们自己难道不都是有好处的吗？在群众运动中这些人被清查或被斗争，难道是不应当的吗？
    当然，错斗了好人，确实给运动带来了一定的副作用，伤害了一些人的感情，造成了一些不好的影响，这是应该有足够认识的。但这个错误，一经发现，我们都做了纠正，有的还正在深入反复的检查和采取各项善后工作的措施。我们相信，由于这个错误而引起一些人的不满，是完全可以消除的，产生的某些不良后果，也是完全可以弥补的。
    在我们的工作中，也有漏的错误。一些单位由于发动群众不够充分，或者调查研究工作不细致、不深入，以致有少数暗藏较深的反革命分子没有被清查出来。在大放大鸣中，少数反革命分子，乘机兴风作浪，更加证实了这种情况。这个方面我们也正在采取必要的措施，使肃反斗争进行彻底。
    有反必肃，有错必纠
    为着彻底纠正我们肃反运动中的缺点和错误，更好的巩固成果，根据“有反必肃”“有错必纠”的方针，根据中央的指示，我省从一九五六年四月份就提出了复查善后工作，并相继数次召开了专门会议具体进行了部署，强调领导干部亲自阅卷，弄清问题性质，做到定案有据，处理适当，强调及时处理申诉案件，作出实事求是的恰如其分的结论。然后根据不同情况，分别进行处理。除反革命分子和坏分子一律依法交司法机关处理外，对于那些在运动中被错斗过的好人，都诚恳地分别向他们进行了赔礼道歉，恢复了名誉。取得他们的谅解。事实证明：肃反运动即使在个别地区单位发生了比较严重的缺点和错误，一经复查，缺点错误都得到了纠正，损失也得到了弥补。我还要说明，在几次复查和善后工作中，不仅查出了错案，也查出一些被漏掉的反革命分子。因此，在坚决纠正缺点错误的同时，仍然要贯彻有反必肃的精神，不能有丝毫麻痹。那些别有用心的右派分子，抓住个别案件的错误缺点，就加以片面夸大，企图从个别的少数的事实中引伸出肃反运动搞糟了的结论，从而达到否定肃反运动的巨大成绩，动摇人民民主专政的恶毒的目的。可是这只是右派分子的梦想，他们的论调，是经不住驳斥的，因为他们既没有事实的基础，也没有群众的基础。他们的材料和它的来源是可疑的，他们是站在反人民、反社会主义的立场上替反革命分子说话。毛主席在“正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指示我们说：“有些人不了解我们今天的政策适合于今天的情况，过去的政策适合于过去的情况，想利用今天的政策去翻过去的案，想否定过去肃反工作的巨大成绩，这是完全错误的，这是人民群众所不允许的。”我们正告那些攻击肃反运动的右派分子，应当从毛主席这个指示中，得到教育，彻底转变反党、反人民、反对人民民主专政的立场。
    为了把肃反工作做得更好，继续纠正错的和漏的这两个方面的错误，我们热诚的拥护毛主席提议的由人大常委会和政协常委会主持在今年或明年对肃反工作全面检查一次的指示，这对改进工作，正确地处理反革命分子和健全我们的法制有很大好处。
