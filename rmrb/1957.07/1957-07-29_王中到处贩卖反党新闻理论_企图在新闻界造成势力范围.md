Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 28th - According to revelations by Zhang Lizhou, a teaching assistant in the Journalism Department of Fudan University, and students such as Zhu Guoben yesterday, Wang Zhong, a right-wing "theoretician," member of the Fudan University Party Committee, Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs, and Director of the Journalism Department, attempted to form his sphere of influence in the southern press circles to usurp the Party's journalistic cause with bourgeois journalistic viewpoints.

Zhang Lizhou said at the fifth meeting of the Shanghai journalists' symposium yesterday: To realize this conspiracy, Wang Zhong gave lectures in newspapers and radio stations in Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai last summer, propagating his reactionary journalistic theories, attempting to create a tangible and intangible theoretical force in newspapers in the southern region, to confront the northern news agencies. Zhu Guoben said that Wang Zhong had expressed the need for graduates of the Fudan University Journalism Department and graduates of the Peking University Journalism Department to divide their spheres of influence. He felt that the distribution of Fudan Journalism Department graduates was too scattered, and therefore supported their establishment of an alumni association to concentrate their strength.

In a joint speech, fourth-year student Zhu Guoben and two others also revealed: Wang Zhong once told them not to work for the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency after graduation, saying that they would not be successful in those places and should go to other places to use their theories to open up markets. In addition to sending students who accepted his theories to work in newspapers, Wang Zhong's method of cultivating his sphere of influence also attempted to establish a news cadre training class as a "cadre repair shop," transferring current news cadres in newspapers to "repair" their minds. In this way, he could use his so-called bourgeois journalistic viewpoints of "commodity nature," "interest," and "social needs" to transform Party newspapers into newspapers without Party spirit and "non-class struggle tools."

Zhu Guoben and others also revealed that Wang Zhong adopted an attitude of contempt and hostility towards proletarian journalism and the Party's journalistic cause. Last summer, Wang Zhong led a survey team to investigate for a month, collecting some shortcomings in the work of Party newspapers, and then promoted everywhere that provincial newspapers were "a complete mess," "widow's face," "no future," and must be eliminated and become "internal circulars," and so on. Wang Zhong said: "County newspapers are also not well-run and have no value." And the People's Daily will become a newspaper that specializes in publishing communiques and editorials. Wang Zhong also slandered the old cadres of Party newspapers and Xinhua News Agency as having virtue but no talent, and being "dogmatic."

However, Wang Zhong praised the theories and newspapers of bourgeois journalism. Zhang Lizhou and others said: Wang Zhong once proposed to organize a "Fudan News Agency" that was not led by the Party committee, so that students could learn from bourgeois journalists, running around and digging everywhere, without relying on letters of introduction from the Party committee, specializing in social news and cultural and educational news.

    王中到处贩卖反党新闻理论  企图在新闻界造成势力范围
    据新华社上海28日电　据复旦大学新闻系助教张黎州和学生诸国本等昨天揭露，右派“理论家”、复旦大学党委委员、副教务长兼新闻系主任王中曾经企图在南方新闻界中形成他的势力范围，以资产阶级的新闻观点来篡夺党的新闻事业。
    张黎州在昨天举行的上海新闻工作者座谈会第五次会议上说：为了实现这个阴谋，王中曾在去年夏天到济南、青岛、南京及上海等地的报社、电台讲演，宣扬他的反动新闻理论，企图在南方一带的报社中造成有形无形的理论势力，同北方的新闻机关对垒。诸国本说，王中曾表示要复旦大学新闻系的毕业生同北京大学新闻专业毕业生划分势力范围，他感到复旦新闻系毕业生分配太分散，因而曾支持他们成立同学会，以便集中力量。
    四年级学生诸国本等三人联合发言中还揭露：王中曾经要他们毕业后不要到人民日报和新华通讯社去工作，说那些地方吃不开，要到别的地方去，运用自己的理论开辟市场。王中培植他自己势力范围的手段，除了把接受他的理论的学生派往报社工作外，还企图成立一个新闻干部训练班，作为“干部修理厂”，把目前报社中的新闻干部调来“修理、修理”脑筋。这样，就可以用他的所谓“商品性”、“趣味性”、“社会需要论”等资产阶级新闻观点，来改造党报成为没有党性的“非阶级斗争工具”的报纸。
    诸国本等还揭露，王中对无产阶级的新闻学和党的新闻事业采取蔑视和仇视的态度。去年夏天，王中领了一个调查团出外调查了一个月，搜集了一些党报工作中的缺点，就到处宣扬省报“一团糟”、“寡妇脸”、“没有前途”，一定要被淘汰成为“内部通报”，等等。王中说：“县报也办得不像话，没有存在价值。”而人民日报会成为一张专门登载公报和社论的报纸。王中还污蔑党报和新华社的老干部有德无才，是“吃教条”的。
    可是，王中对资产阶级新闻的理论和报纸却推崇备至。张黎州等说：王中曾提出要组织一个不由党委领导的“复旦通讯社”，让学生学习资产阶级记者那样到处跑、到处钻，而不靠党委介绍信，专搞社会新闻和文教新闻。
