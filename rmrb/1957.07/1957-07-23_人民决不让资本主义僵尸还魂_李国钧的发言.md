The current session of the National People's Congress is being held on an extraordinary day. On the eve of the meeting, Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," a guiding document of great historical significance in terms of thought and theory, was published; and a fierce and profound class struggle against the right-wing elements was launched throughout the country.

At the meeting, we heard Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the two reports by Vice Premiers Li and Bo. These reports fully reflect the common will of the 600 million people of the country and sternly refuted the absurd and fallacious arguments of the bourgeois right-wing elements against the Party, against socialism, and against the people's democratic dictatorship with rich, vivid, and concrete examples. I fully agree with and support these three reports and all other reports.

As the report pointed out, the past year was a year of great transformation for our country. During this period, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers, peasants, intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen, and all patriotic people of the country, on the basis of the victory of the five major movements of decisive significance, basically completed the extremely profound and extensive socialist revolution through the three major transformations. This opened a new era in the history of our country, completely changed the socio-economic outlook of our country, basically eliminated the system of exploitation of man by man, established a socialist economic system, eradicated the decadent and parasitic lifestyle, and established a new socialist morality. While achieving the great victory of the socialist revolution, we also achieved brilliant achievements in the great socialist construction. The main production targets of the First Five-Year Plan were basically completed one year ahead of schedule, and the infrastructure construction targets and some other targets were also close to completion. This ensures the possibility of completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule, and lays a solid foundation for the economic construction of the Second Five-Year Plan.

It must be pointed out that in the process of the revolutionary cause of earth-shaking changes and the construction cause of unprecedented progress being carried out and achieving victory in mutual intersection, no significant fluctuations were caused in the social order and social economy of our country, and the stagnation of production and all other destructive effects were avoided as much as possible. In the process of economic construction, we not only achieved great successes, but also accumulated extremely rich and valuable experiences. At the same time, in the first year after the success of the socialist revolution, our social system and economic undertakings successfully withstood a severe test in the severe natural disasters of last year. We know that this historically unprecedented and glorious achievement, which every true patriot of ours should be proud of, is not accidental, but is the result of the unity and common struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which correctly combines the actual conditions of Chinese society and creatively applies the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. This achievement makes it possible for us to traverse the road that our predecessors had not completed in a hundred years in a short period of more than seven years, thereby creating a miracle on the economic construction front. This achievement not only opens up a bright and happy future for the people of our country, but also has historical significance for the whole world. It has been valued by the people of all socialist brother countries, and it encourages all peoples of all countries who are fighting for liberation, independence, and freedom. It has set up a clear banner in the world after the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution. This truth, which has been repeatedly proved in the practice of revolution and construction in our country, is indelible forever and cannot be denied by anyone.

It must be pointed out that the great achievements made by our country in economic construction are inseparable from our learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the generous and selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to our country in various aspects of economy, technology, and culture. As everyone knows, when the country was founded in 1949, the Soviet government was the first to recognize our country, and starting from the sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge, it first helped us to restore and rebuild our national economy on the basis of the dilapidated economic foundation left over from before liberation, and then, together with other brother countries, enthusiastically helped us to carry out long-term economic construction, and provided us with the main high-quality technical equipment. The Soviet Union's technical assistance and guidance were implemented throughout the entire construction process for some important construction projects, from exploration and design to construction, installation, trial operation, and commissioning. In order to realize this assistance, the Soviet government did not hesitate to transfer outstanding experts with rich experience and superb knowledge from important positions in their own country to our country. In the past, when I worked with Soviet experts, I received a profound education that combined internationalism and patriotism from them, and I deeply realized their sincere friendship and humble and amiable style. I was moved by their selfless labor and responsible attitude of loyally loving their own cause, and I was encouraged by the noble qualities of the red experts cultivated in socialist society. Today, I mark the Soviet government's and people's friendly assistance to our country, which is full of lofty internationalist spirit, with infinite gratitude. This fraternal international assistance can only be obtained from socialist countries like the Soviet Union, and it has set an unprecedented example in the history of our country's foreign relations. This deep friendship and close unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is forever unbreakable and cannot be shaken by any force.

At the same time, the reactionary group of American monopoly capital, such as Dulles, still curses us, hates our social system, hopes that our construction cause will collapse, and vainly attempts to throw us back into the claws of the colonialists to satisfy their greed for exploitation and plunder. In fact, the clamor of Dulles and his ilk is nothing but "a fool's dream." After all, "dreams" are phantom-like bubbles, not real life. We believe that the roar of anti-colonialism of the people all over the world will sooner or later wake them up from their "delusion."

At present, there are still some people in our country who are negating achievements, negating reality, and negating truth. These people are the bourgeois right-wing group headed by Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and others. The right-wing elements took advantage of this opportunity to help the Party in rectification to stir up trouble and start fires everywhere. They launched a rampant attack on the basic system stipulated in our country's Constitution, on the just cause of hard work of the people of the whole country, and on the friendly unity between socialist countries in an organized, planned, and strategic manner. They attempted to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow socialism, and drag China back to the old road of bourgeois democratic system serving the interests of imperialism. As intellectuals in the ranks of the working people, we must resolutely draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements, and together with the broad masses of the people, fight the right-wing elements to the end, give their political conspiracy activities a merciless blow, and temper ourselves in the battle.

I solemnly warn the right-wing elements: Do not forget that the fruits of the people's victory are not easily obtained. This is the continuation of the cause of arduous struggle of the patriots and revolutionary martyrs in our country for the independence and prosperity of the motherland in the past hundred years, especially the realization of the great just cause that the Chinese people have struggled for through untold hardships and bloody sacrifices under the leadership of the Communist Party in the past thirty years. The painful lessons of being oppressed and bloodily ruled by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in the past are still fresh in the minds of the people. Whoever wants to rob this fruit of victory will be crushed by the giant palm of the people. Through revolutionary practice and historical proof, the Chinese people have correctly chosen the bright road they should take, which is to take the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party. Do not forget that although China is large, you will have no place to stand if you deviate from the socialist track; although there are many Chinese people, you will become a pitiful bug weeping alone if you betray the will of the people. You vainly attempt to move out the capitalist zombie that has long been buried by the people from the tomb to revive it. But you are wasting your efforts, because the "zombie" cannot "return to life" in broad daylight. Only a group of reactionary guys abroad are fascinated with your capitalist restoration zombie. Let them embrace your zombie and kiss it wildly! This is their freedom.

In the process of completing the arduous tasks of great revolution and great construction, have we also discovered some mistakes and shortcomings? As the report clearly pointed out, there are. But I think this is inevitable, because this is a struggle in real life, not a myth. Only in myths can there be only achievements and no shortcomings. What's more, the planned and proportionate development of the complex national economy is still the first time to be carried out in our country, and there is not enough experience, and we must continue to explore its development law. However, it must be affirmed that the nature of these shortcomings and errors is individual, partial, and temporary, and more importantly, we can summarize valuable experiences and lessons from these shortcomings and errors, that is to say, to turn negative things into positive factors. This will be more conducive to the development of economic construction in the future, and conducive to solving the "contradiction between the objective law of economic development in socialist society and our subjective understanding" in practice.

As the saying goes: "Contentment brings happiness." This sentence is not applicable to us today. We are not "content," because we are not satisfied with the achievements we have already obtained, but we must draw on experience and lessons on the basis of the achievements we have already obtained, to further improve our political and ideological level and scientific and technological level, and to build our country's socialist society better and faster according to the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift. But we are "always happy." Because we have the confidence to build our "economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture"; because we have found the truth -- Marxism-Leninism; because we have a working-class political party -- the Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, which has been tempered in revolutionary struggles for more than thirty years. Let us always remember Chairman Mao's solemn admonition in the opening speech of the First National People's Congress:

"Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible to any enemy.
The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party.
The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism."

Let us unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, contribute our greatest strength, overcome all difficulties, destroy all provocations of reactionary groups, defend socialism, and fight to the end for the just cause of the motherland with extremely glorious and great confidence!

    人民决不让资本主义僵尸还魂
    李国钧的发言
    这次人大会议是在一个不平凡的日子里召开的。在会议的前夕，发表了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一具有伟大历史意义的思想理论指导文献；在全国各地展开了反击右派分子的一场激烈而深刻的阶级斗争。
    在会议上我们听了周总理的“政府工作报告”和李、薄副总理的两项报告。这些报告充分地反映了全国六亿人民的共同意志，并以丰富、生动而具体的事例严正地驳斥了资产阶级右派分子反党、反社会主义、反人民民主专政的谰言谬论。我完全同意和拥护这三个报告和其他各项报告。
    过去一年，正如报告中所指出的，是我国伟大转变的一年。在这个期间，全国工人、农民、知识分子、工商业者和一切爱国人士在中国共产党的领导下，在具有决定意义的五大运动的胜利基础上，通过三大改造基本上完成了极其深刻而广泛的社会主义革命。这样就在我国历史上开辟了新纪元，彻底改变了我国的社会经济面貌，基本上消灭了人剥削人的制度，建立了社会主义的经济制度，铲除了腐朽的、寄生的生活风尚，树立了新的社会主义道德。在取得伟大社会主义革命胜利的同时，我们也获得了伟大社会主义建设的辉煌成就。第一个五年计划的主要生产指标基本上提前一年完成了，基建指标和其他一些指标也接近于完成。这样就保证了有可能提前完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并为第二个五年计划的经济建设奠定了巩固的基础。
    必须指出，在翻天复地的革命事业和震古铄今的建设事业互相交叉进行而取得胜利的过程中，在我国社会秩序和社会经济方面并没有引起显著的波动，而尽可能地避免了生产停滞和其他一切破坏作用。在经济建设过程中，我们不但获得了巨大成绩，而且积累了极其丰富的宝贵经验。同时，在社会主义革命成功后的第一年里，我们的社会制度和经济事业就在去年严重的自然灾害中成功地经受了一次考验。我们知道，这个历史上空前的、值得我们每一个真正爱国者引以自豪的辉煌成就不是偶然得来的，而是全国各族人民在正确结合中国社会实际、创造性地运用马克思列宁主义普遍真理的中国共产党领导下团结一致和共同奋斗的成果。这个成果使我们有可能以七年多的短短期间走过了前人百年来所未走完的道路，从而在经济建设阵线上创造了奇迹。这个成果不但给我国人民开辟了光明幸福的前途，而且取得了全世界的历史意义。它受到了各社会主义兄弟国家人民的重视，并且鼓舞着一切为争取解放和独立自由而奋斗的各国人民。它继伟大十月社会主义革命胜利之后在世界上又树立起一面鲜明的旗帜。在我国革命和建设实践当中一再证明了的这个真理，是永远不可磨灭的，是任何人否定不了的。
    必须指出，我国在经济建设上所取得的丰功伟绩，是与我们学习苏联先进经验和苏联对我国在经济、技术和文化各方面所给予的慷慨无私的援助分不开的。大家都知道，在一九四九年建国当时，苏联政府第一个承认了我国，并且从求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望出发，首先帮助我们在解放前遗留下来的残破经济基础上来恢复和改建我国的国民经济，继而，和其他兄弟国家一起热情地帮助我们进行长期经济建设，并给我们提供了主要的优良技术设备。苏联的技术援助和指导，对于一些重要的建设项目是贯彻在整个建设过程的，从勘探、设计起，一直到施工建筑、安装、试运转和投入生产为止。为了实现这种援助，苏联政府不惜从自己国家的重要岗位上抽调出富有经验和精湛学识的优秀专家派来我国。过去一个时期，当我和苏联专家们在一起工作的时候，我从他们那里曾受到一次深刻的国际主义与爱国主义相结合的教育，深深体会到他们真诚的友情和谦虚、和霭的作风。我为他们的忘我劳动和忠心耿耿地热爱自己的事业的负责态度所感动，我为社会主义社会里培育出来的红色专家的高贵品质所鼓舞。今天，我以无限感谢的心情来标志苏联政府和人民对我国的这种充满着崇高的国际主义精神的友好援助。这种兄弟般的国际援助，也只有从像苏联那样的社会主义国家方面才能得到，它并且在我国对外关系史上树立了空前的范例。中苏两国人民的这种深厚友谊和紧密团结，是永远颠扑不破的，是任何力量动摇不了的。
    与此同时，美国垄断资本的反动集团，如杜勒斯等，一直到今天还在咒骂我们，仇视我们的社会制度，希望我们的建设事业垮台，妄想使我们重新投入殖民主义者的爪牙中，来满足它们榨取和掠夺的贪欲。其实，杜勒斯之流的叫嚣不过是“痴人说梦”。“梦境”毕竟是泡沫一样的幻影，而不是现实生活。我们相信，全世界人民反殖民主义的怒吼声，迟早会把他们从“迷梦”中惊醒过来。
    目前，在我们国内，也仍有一些人在否定成绩、否定现实、否定真理。这些人就是以章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等为首的资产阶级右派集团。右派分子利用这次帮助党整风的机会兴风作浪，到处点火。他们向我国宪法所规定的基本制度、向全国人民艰苦奋斗的正义事业、向社会主义国家之间的友好团结，有组织、有计划、有策略地发动了猖狂的进攻。他们企图取消共产党的领导，推翻社会主义，把中国拖回到为帝国主义利益服务的资产阶级民主制度的老路上去。我们作为劳动人民队伍中的知识分子，一定要坚决地和右派分子划清界限，和广大人民群众在一起，向右派分子斗争到底，对他们的政治阴谋活动给以无情的痛击，并且在战斗中锻炼自己。
    我郑重地警告右派分子：你们不要忘记，人民的胜利果实不是容易得来的。这是我国近百年来志士仁人和革命先烈为祖国独立富强而艰苦奋斗的事业的继续，尤其是近三十年来中国人民在共产党领导下经历千辛万苦和流血牺牲所争取到的伟大正义事业的实现。过去受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的压迫和血腥统治的惨痛教训，在人民心目中记忆犹新。谁想要劫夺这一胜利果实，他就会被人民的巨掌所粉碎。通过革命实践和历史证明，中国人民正确地选择了自己应走的光明大道，这就是在共产党领导下走社会主义的道路。你们不要忘记，中国地虽大，但离开了社会主义轨道，你们就会没有容身之地；中国人虽多，但背叛了人民意志，你们就会变成向隅而泣的可怜虫。你们妄想从坟墓中搬出早已被人民埋葬了的资本主义僵尸来让它复辟。但你们是枉费心机了，因为“僵尸”在光天化日之下是不可能
  “还魂”的。对你们的资本主义复辟僵尸一见钟情的，只是国外的一群反动家伙们。让他们拥抱着你们这个僵尸狂吻去吧！这是他们的自由。
    在完成大革命和大建设的艰巨任务过程中，是否也发现了一些错误和缺点呢？正如报告中明确指出，是有的。但我认为，这是不可避免的，因为这是现实生活中的斗争，而不是神话。在神话里才能只有成绩，而没有缺点。何况，错综复杂的国民经济有计划、按比例发展的事业，在我国还是初次搞，还没有足够的经验，还要继续摸索它的发展规律。不过，必须肯定这些缺点和错误的性质是个别的、局部的和暂时的，而更重要的是在于我们能够从这些缺点和错误中总结出宝贵的经验教训，也就是说，把消极的东西变为积极的因素。这样就更有利于今后经济建设事业的发展，有利于在实践当中去解决“社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾”。
    俗语说：“知足者常乐”。这句话对我们今天来说，是不适用的。我们不是“知足者”，因为我们不满足于已获得的成绩，而是要在已获得的成绩的基础上来吸取经验教训，来进一步提高我们的政治思想水平和科学技术水平，并根据勤俭建国的方针更好地、更快地建成我国的社会主义社会。但我们却是“常乐”。因为我们有信心把我们这样一个“经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家”；因为我们找到了真理——马克思列宁主义；因为我们有着三十多年来在革命斗争中经过千锤百炼的为马克思列宁主义所武装的工人阶级政党——共产党的领导。让我们永远记住毛主席在人大第一次会议开幕词中的庄严诰诫：
    “我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。
    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
    指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
    让我们更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，贡献出最大的力量，克服一切艰难困苦，摧毁一切反动集团的挑衅，捍卫社会主义，信心百倍地为祖国极其光荣伟大的正义事业奋斗到底！
