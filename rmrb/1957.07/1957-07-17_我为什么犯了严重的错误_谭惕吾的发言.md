In this movement to help the Party rectify its work style, my speeches were seriously wrong and I am guilty. When the bourgeois rightists were frantically attacking the Party, the proletariat, and socialism, I did not stand firm, was shaken by the rightist rhetoric, and put forward four erroneous suggestions. These four suggestions were reactionary in their essence, consistent with the rightist rhetoric and proposals. Moreover, I spoke more specifically and comprehensively than other rightists. In effect, I not only plunged myself into the mire of the rightists but also acted as their vanguard. Now, looking back, I feel very painful and remorseful. Why did I make such serious mistakes? At first, due to my low level of political and ideological understanding and insufficient awareness, I could not find the reason for my mistakes. After the help of my comrades, and after studying documents and engaging in strict self-struggle, I began to realize that my mistakes had not only social roots but also cognitive roots.

I. I am an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background, and I was educated in the past with a set of bourgeois theories of dictatorship. After leaving school, I worked in reactionary governments for a long time, and I was deeply poisoned by bourgeois state theory and greatly influenced by bourgeois state political life. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, although I also studied the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the old ideas and old viewpoints had not been thoroughly criticized, they still occupied a dominant position in my ideological field. Therefore, the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat could not penetrate into the depths of my thinking, and I felt unaccustomed to the political life of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Although I was very willing to accept the leadership of the Party in my heart, because I did not understand the Party's leadership theory and leadership methods, etc., this acceptance of the Party's leadership was only an abstract acceptance. As for what the Party used to guarantee its leadership, I had not deeply thought about this issue in the past. When the bourgeois rightists frantically attacked the Party, some of the bourgeois political fallacies they put forward, as well as the bourgeois legal viewpoints, resonated with me without any distinction because they came from the same source as my reactionary ideological roots and reactionary viewpoints.

II. I had a strong sense of statism in my student days, so I once joined the Youth Party. However, I soon discovered that they were not true patriots, but careerists who tried to use young students as political capital to achieve their goals of promotion and wealth. Thus, I resolutely left them. I left them not to oppose statism, but to oppose that group of people. As for the reactionary statism, it has not been criticized and has been stubbornly printed in my heart. After liberation, I fully reflected this reactionary thought in the following issues.

(1) Regarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship signed in 1949, I was very dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's retention of the two ports of Lushun and Dalian. I thought that China had been liberated, the Communist Party was leading the Chinese people, the Soviet Union was our big brother, and internationalism could serve as a guarantee of Sino-Soviet friendship. If another world war were to occur, not only Dalian and Lushun could be used by the Soviet Union, but other places could also be used by the Soviet Union. Why retain two ports? I once said: "Is the friendship of 450 million people not more reliable than two ports?" - Isn't this the idea of statism at work? Isn't this a suspicion of the internationalist Soviet Union? Isn't this a doubt and distrust of the treaty signed to protect our national defense, and the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Dalian and Lushun?

(2) Reflected in my view on the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. At that time, I had fear of the United States. I believed that China had just been liberated, and the reactionary remnants of Chiang Kai-shek had not been wiped out. It would be best to take advantage of the victory of the revolution to wipe out the remnants of the counter-revolution in one fell swoop, so that the whole country could be unified. I believed that unifying China at that time would not take much effort, and then going to aid Korea would have no worries. At the same time, I believed that the Soviet Union was stronger than us, and there was no war problem in the country. It was also the United Nations representative stationed in North Korea. The United States supported South Korea's attack on North Korea. The Soviet Union should send troops to aid North Korea, and we would do some logistics work for the Soviet Union, so it would be more certain to defeat the United States. If the Soviet Union did not send troops and asked China to provide assistance, it was very likely that the US aggression would not be repelled, but instead would cause trouble for ourselves. These thoughts were completely narrow-minded statism and completely lacked the spirit of internationalism.

After the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Dalian and Lushun, after the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the selfless support of China and Korea by the Soviet Union in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and after the Party sent me to the Soviet Union and North Korea to personally receive the great internationalist life practice education of the proletariat, I fully realized that my past thinking was very wrong. I had a knowledge of internationalism, and my confidence in the Party's leadership and the correctness of leadership was strengthened. Therefore, I felt extremely excited about China's material assistance to Korea and other brother countries, and felt that the Party and the government were doing very correctly. However, this reactionary statism has not been thoroughly excavated and eradicated. This time, it made me make mistakes in the opinions put forward on the issue of the national system. Under the control of this reactionary thought, I believed that the role of the state machine was omnipotent. I believed that the Party could lead the country by controlling the state apparatus. Why should there be a set of departments in the Party corresponding to the government? This implicitly negated the Party's leadership in the country's political life and the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Party's core role in state affairs.

(3) Also, due to the subjective one-sidedness of my own ideological method, I did not conduct a comprehensive investigation and study of the so-called problems reflected by the rightists that the division of Party and government powers was unclear, and I did not realize that this was only a problem caused by the inappropriate work style and methods of individual people. Instead, I mistakenly believed that this was due to the existence of a set of institutions in the Party and another set of institutions in the government. In addition, I did not understand the huge role played by the departments in the Party that corresponded to the government in the country's political life. I mistakenly believed that they were only institutions that controlled policy thinking and supervised the government. I thought that the Party's policy thinking could be made into national laws and decrees, and the Party's role in supervising the government could be brought into play in the National People's Congress. Therefore, I suggested that the departments in the Party that corresponded to the government should be placed in the National People's Congress. I believed that this was in line with Lenin's theory that "the upper level of the Soviets and the upper level of the Party are integrated," while neglecting the integrity of the proletarian vanguard organizational system.

At the same time, my opinions on the Party's observance of the Constitution and the national system also reflected the one-sidedness of my ideological methods. Based on an extremely isolated case in Shanghai's housing reform, I made an extremely wrong proposal to the Party to abide by the Constitution. The case I was based on was not only extremely isolated, but after checking it, the case I provided was not a mistake of the Party's policy. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee had already stated that the housing reform policy was based on the boundary of rented houses. As for the fact that individual houses used as living materials were also included in the joint state-private ownership, it was because this part of the houses was jointly owned in the entire rented house. However, I proposed that houses used as living materials should not be included in the joint state-private ownership, and used such a non-policy error to misunderstand that the Party's policy violated the Constitution, and suggested that the Party conduct an inspection. This was simply a slander against the Party and a guilty statement.

(4) Due to my strong bourgeois legal views, I believed that the law was supreme. I thought that before the Party seized power, when the Party had any proposals and actions on the country's political life, it could only rely on Party instructions to transmit to the masses through Party members and Party work agencies. However, after seizing power, the state apparatus was in the hands of the Party, and the Party's policies and instructions, as long as they needed to be observed and implemented by the people of the whole country, could be made into laws and decrees by the national legislative body, and the government could make resolutions and orders and issue them to the whole country for implementation. However, I did not realize that the Marxist-Leninist legal methods are to come from the masses and go to the masses, and to make laws and decrees only after typical practice and summarizing experience. If I did it according to my suggestion, it would make laws and decrees divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, and it would lead to the consequence that "a mere law is not enough to be implemented by itself." In order to ensure the implementation of the political line and the implementation of political proposals, the Party's promulgation of internal instructions is completely necessary. Although the internal instructions I mentioned were only instructions with legal and regulatory properties. But even for this kind of instruction, before it is made into laws and decrees, it is absolutely necessary for the Party to obtain typical practical experience in its work, and then make it into laws and decrees. Therefore, my suggestion was wrong.

As for the opinion I put forward that the three departments of the court, supervision, and lawyers should be led by separate personnel appointed by the Party and should not be led by a Party committee, its own erroneous nature lies in the fact that it is rooted in the bourgeois political thought of the separation of powers, which is contrary to the principle of the Party's collective leadership in the dictatorship of the proletariat.

(5) Due to my insufficient theoretical study and vague ideological understanding, I did not understand the root causes of the three major isms. I mistakenly and directly thought that the Party departments and government counterparts were set up within the Party, and all the people participating in the work were Party members, which would easily lead to sectarianism that isolated them from non-Party members. Also, because I didn't understand the working methods and actual situation of the various departments of the Party, I thought that the representatives of the National People's Congress had the opportunity to go to the local area for inspection twice a year, and the various departments of the Party and the government may not have as many opportunities to inspect all parts of the country, which would easily lead to detachment from reality and generate bureaucracy and subjectivism. Therefore, I suggested placing the various departments of the Party in the National People's Congress. This would not only lead non-Party members to carry out their work, but also allow them to conduct inspections throughout the country on a regular basis, which would facilitate contact with reality. I did not realize that the proletarian vanguard is good at concentrating the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and is closely connected with the masses and with reality at all times and in all places. The root cause of the three major isms is a reflection of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology within the Party, not caused by the system itself.

(6) Due to my strong bourgeois political thinking and the inferiority of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' conceit and arrogance, coupled with the fact that I joined the revolutionary work too late and did not understand the Party's leadership power and the Party's rich experience in struggle and work experience, and I did not master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, I lacked the ability to distinguish when the rightists were slandering and attacking the Party. I mistakenly believed that some of the problems they were attacking were indeed caused by the shortcomings of the system, thus causing myself to doubt the Party's way of leading the country. In this way, I became a tool for the rightists to attack the Party and the national system, and rashly put forward those wrong suggestions.

Based on the above-mentioned ideological roots that made me make mistakes, it is examined that my position is non-proletarian. Although I am engaged in work under the leadership of the Party, my relationship with the Party is not established on the proletarian position.

I began to accept the leadership of the Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, my thoughts belonged to the category of patriotic thoughts of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Because the slogan put forward by the Party at that time was to unite and resist Japan, and I, like other intellectuals in the White Area, hated Chiang Kai-shek's anti-popular and counter-revolutionary policy of appeasement first. Therefore, under the call of the Party, I felt that the country had vitality, and I loved the Party and approached the Party with the ideological feelings of the petty bourgeoisie, and decided to follow the Party. After liberation, due to the success of the Party's leadership of the people's revolutionary cause, due to the Party's unprecedented unification of the country, due to the Party's improvement of the country's international status, and due to the Party's achievements in leading all aspects of national construction, I still admired the Party. However, this love for the Party is different from the proletariat's love for the Party. I love the Party because the Party has done a good job in the country, and I do not love the Party as my own life. In addition, after liberation, my relationship with the Party was not close enough, and there was a strong idea of being a guest in my work. In this way, I unknowingly alienated myself from the Party. In the rectification movement, if anyone proposes not to let the Party lead the country, I am against it. My opposition is not to maintain the leadership of the Party, but to maintain the country (my concept of the country still belongs to the category of the bourgeois country). Because I believe that apart from the Communist Party leading the country, I do not believe that any other party can lead the country well. However, when others mentioned the shortcomings of the Party's work and the shortcomings of individual Party members, I did not stand on the Party's position and take a correct attitude, but stood on the position of a third party to treat the opinions put forward by others. Sometimes I myself stood on the opposite position of the Party to put forward critical opinions to the Party.

Because my position has not been transformed to the proletarian side, I have not established a blood-related ideological feeling for the Party, and I have not actively and proactively understood the Party's leadership in the revolutionary cause, the leadership in various great social reform movements, and the various great achievements in the leadership of socialist construction, to understand the strength and correctness of the Party's leadership power and organizational line. On the contrary, I exaggerated individual shortcomings and errors in the work into overall shortcomings and errors, shaking my own confidence in the Party. Therefore, in the face of complex class struggles, I could not distinguish the direction, and I could not distinguish between correct and wrong opinions. I did not use the loyal feelings of defending the Party and defending the people's cause to fight against a group of villains who opposed the Party and opposed the people. On the contrary, I was influenced by that anti-Party and anti-people atmosphere, and also made wrong remarks that opposed the Party and opposed the people. If the Party had not led the people of the whole country to fight back against the rightists in time, I think I would have dangerously degenerated into a sinner of the people.

(II)

Due to the above-mentioned series of reactionary ideological roots and positional errors, I put forward four extremely reactionary suggestions. At the beginning, I did not realize the reactionary nature of these four suggestions. I believed that my suggestions were to hope that the Party would strengthen its leadership over the state apparatus, and I did not realize its harm. After criticism and help from all parties, and after re-studying the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report at the "Eighth National Congress," Deputy Prime Minister Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution, the two articles on the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and Premier Zhou's government work report, as well as the People's Daily editorial on rectification, I realized the seriousness of the error in my four suggestions. Now, my thinking is very clear that in our country's socialist cause, it is necessary to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat in order to complete this difficult, complex, tortuous, and huge historical task.

The dictatorship of the proletariat must be realized through the proletarian political party - the Communist Party. The leadership power of the Communist Party of China is strong. It led the Chinese people to overthrow the reactionary rule, drove away imperialism, established the people's democratic regime, implemented a series of social reforms, and is now leading the people of the whole country towards the future of socialist construction. The Communist Party of China has mastered the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. It is as closely integrated with the workers and peasants as the heart is with the body. Its power is strong. All its measures are based on the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. It is closely connected with reality at all times and in all places. Therefore, its political line and organizational line are correct. The Chinese Party has only acquired political power after decades of revolutionary struggle history. Therefore, its experience in struggle and work experience are rich. It is good at concentrating the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and transforming this wisdom into a unified will and disciplined action. What else is there that we cannot trust in such a Party leading us? Although I have studied all of this in the past, because my reactionary thoughts have not been excavated, my study has only remained on the surface and in terms of concepts, without deeply linking it to my own ideological reality, without deeply combining it with the actual situation of why the new China has achieved victory, to think deeply about it. Therefore, these studies have not taken root in my mind. The evil wind of reactionary thought blew away some of the concepts that I had learned, and the reactionary bourgeois political theory took the upper hand, vainly trying to use a set of bourgeois political theories and working methods to replace the proletarian dictatorship theory and working methods, while ignoring that the nature of the bourgeois revolution and the nature of the proletarian revolution are essentially different. The bourgeois revolution is carried out after the bourgeois economic foundation has grown out of the feudal economic foundation. After the bourgeoisie seizes power, its task is to guarantee and promote the development of the original bourgeois economic foundation. Therefore, seizing power is the completion of the purpose of the bourgeois revolution. The state machine has become the only tool of the bourgeois dictatorship. However, the proletarian revolution is carried out before the socialist economic foundation has been established. Seizing power is only the beginning of the proletarian revolutionary task, not the end. After the proletariat seizes power, its task is to destroy the old economic foundation, thereby establishing a new socialist economic foundation. It wants to eliminate exploitation and establish an equal society for everyone without exploitation. It wants to create a perfect future for the prosperity and happy life of the vast majority of the people. Specifically, in China, after the Party seizes power, it must fundamentally change the semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic foundation and establish an ideal socialist society. This task is unprecedentedly arduous. Without the leadership of the Party, without a complete and substantial organizational system of the Party, without a complete system of the proletarian dictatorship, this huge historical task cannot be completed. If we do according to my four suggestions, it will abolish the leadership of the Party in the country's political life, it will restrict the leadership of the Party in policy thinking, and it will put the Party under the state, instead of becoming the core force of the state to lead the country.

Especially, due to the one-sidedness and subjectivity of my ideological methods, as well as my own position of standing outside the Party, the errors of individual Party members in their work were rendered into the errors of the Party. I doubted the Party and distrusted the Party, and believed that the Party's leadership methods and methods should be revised. In this way, the mistakes I made were even more serious.

Through this intense class struggle, I have received a profound education. Because I made such a serious mistake and made guilty remarks against the Party and the people, after painful examination and strict ideological struggle, I realized the importance of intellectual transformation. An intellectual, if he does not undergo thorough ideological transformation, does not possess the worldview of the working class, and does not master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, cannot stand firm on the position of the people, and cannot establish a blood-related ideological feeling with the Party, and the old reactionary thoughts and reactionary positions cannot be completely changed. As long as the position is not changed, as long as the reactionary thoughts still exist more or less, then serious mistakes will be made at any time and in any place: seeing problems, making suggestions, handling work, and treating people will not be correct. If you don't make mistakes today, you will make mistakes tomorrow. If you don't make mistakes on this issue, you will make mistakes on that issue. Even in the face of complex class struggles, you will not be able to distinguish the direction, causing the painful lesson of "one wrong step leads to eternal regret."

Through this class struggle, I have clearly recognized myself. I want to resolutely deny the old me under the education of the Party and with the help of my comrades, and gradually make the new me grow up on the basis of a new awakening. This is the guarantee I make to the Party and my comrades.

    我为什么犯了严重的错误
    谭惕吾的发言
    （一）
    在这次帮助党整风的运动中，我的言论，是犯了严重错误的，是有罪的。当资产阶级的右派分子，向党、向无产阶级、向社会主义疯狂进攻的时候，我没有站稳立场，为右派言论所动摇，提出了四点错误的建议。这四点建议骨髓里面是反动的，是与右派言论和主张相符合的。而且，我比其它的右派说得更具体更全面。无形中，不仅把自己滚进了右派的泥坑里，而且还做了他们的急先锋。现在检查起来，我非常痛苦、非常悔恨。我为什么会犯这样严重的错误呢？开始时由于自己的政治思想水平不高，觉悟不够，我总找不出犯错误的原因；经过了同志们的帮助，并经过学习文件和严格的自我斗争，我才开始认识到我犯错误不但有社会的根源，而且有认识上的根源。
    一、我是小资产阶级出身的知识分子，过去所受的是资产阶级的教育，学习的是一套资产阶级的专政理论。离开学校后在反动政府里，长期从事政法工作，资产阶级的国家理论中毒很深，资产阶级的国家政治生活影响很大。解放以后，在党的领导下，虽然也学习过无产阶级专政的理论，但是，因为旧的思想和旧的观点没有经过深刻的批判，仍然占居了我的思想领域中的主导地位。从而无产阶级专政理论就不可能深入到我的思想深处，无产阶级专政的政治生活对我也感到不习惯。虽然我心里很愿意接受党的领导，但是，因为对党的领导理论和领导方式等等不够了解，这样接受党的领导也只是一种抽象的接受。至于党用什么来保证自己的领导，过去没有深刻地想过这个问题。在资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，他们所提出的一些资产阶级政治谬论，以及资产阶级的法制观点，因为和我的反动的思想根源和反动观点是同出一脉，所以我就毫无辨别的同他们发出了共鸣。
    二、我在学生时代就有浓厚的国家主义的思想，因而曾经一度参加了青年党，但是，很快我发现他们并不是一些真正的爱国人士，而是企图利用青年学生作为政治资本达到他们升官发财的目的的野心家。这样，我就毅然决然地离开了他们。我离开他们，并不是为了反对国家主义，而是反对他们那批人。至于反动的国家主义思想一直没有经过批判，仍然很顽强地印在我的心里。解放以后，我在下面问题上充分地反映出了这种反动思想。
    （1）对一九四九年签订的中苏友好条约的看法，我那时对于苏联保留旅顺、大连两个港口很不满意，我想，中国已经解放了，共产党领导着中国人民，苏联是我们的老大哥，国际主义可以作为中苏友好的保障，假若再有世界大战发生，不仅大连、旅顺可以供苏联运用，其他地方也可供苏联运用，何必要保留两个港口。我曾经说过：“四亿五千万人民的友情，难道不比两个港口还更可靠吗？”——这不是国家主义的思想在作祟吗？这不是对国际主义的苏联在怀疑吗？这不是对于条约上签订的为了保卫我们的国防，而苏军暂时留驻大连、旅顺表示怀疑和不信任吗？
    （2）表现在对于抗美援朝的看法上面。我当时是有恐美思想，认为中国刚解放，蒋介石的反动残余还没有肃清，最好是趁着革命胜利的形势，一下子把反革命的残余势力肃清，使全国统一起来。我认为当时一下子统一中国是费不了多少力的，而后再去援助朝鲜，那就没有后顾之忧。同时，认为苏联比我们力量强大，国内又没有战争问题，他又是联合国派驻北朝鲜的代表，美国支持南朝鲜向北朝鲜进攻，苏联应该出兵援助北朝鲜，我们再替苏联做些后勤工作，那就对于打败美国比较有把握。苏联不出兵，要中国去援助，很可能打不退美国的进攻，反而惹火烧身。这些思想完全是狭隘的国家主义的思想，完全缺乏国际主义的精神。
    以上两个问题经过苏联对中国的无私援助和苏军在大连、旅顺两地的撤除，经过抗美援朝的胜利和苏联在抗美援朝战争中无私的支援中国、支援朝鲜的许多动人事实的教育，并经过党派我到苏联和朝鲜两个国家去亲身接受无产阶级的伟大的国际主义的生活实践教育，我完全认识到自己过去那种想法是很错误的，对于国际主义有了认识，对党领导力量和领导的正确性更加强了信心。因此，在后来中国对朝鲜以及其他兄弟国家的物资支援方面，我是感到异常兴奋，觉得党与政府做得十分正确。可是这一反动的国家主义思想，并没有经过彻底挖掘，连根拔除。这次又在国家制度的问题所提意见方面，使我犯了错误。在这一反动思想支配下，我认为国家机器的作用是万能的，我认为党掌握了国家机构来领导国家就行了，何必再在党内搞一套与政府对口的各部，这就无形中否定了党在国家政治生活中的领导，无形中否定了无产阶级专政的理论和党在国家事务中的核心作用。
    （3）又由于自己思想方法的主观片面性，对于右派分子所反映出来的所谓：党政职权划分不清而产生出来的某些问题，没有全面调查研究，没有认识到，这只是个别人的工作作风和工作方法不恰当所产生的问题，而错误地认为这是由于党内有一套机构，政府又有一套机构而产生的问题，加以我对党内与政府对口各部在国家政治生活中所起的巨大作用并不明白，错误地认为它们只是掌握政策思想和监督政府的机构。我想，党的政策思想可以制成国家的法律法令，党监督政府的作用可以在全国人民代表大会中来发挥。因此，我建议把党内与政府的对口各部放在人大会里。我认为这是符合列宁所说的“苏维埃的上层和党的上层溶成一体”的理论的，而忽视了无产阶级先锋队组织系统的完整性。
    同时，在我关于对党遵守宪法和国家制度问题所提的意见，也反映了我的思想方法的片面性。我根据上海市房改中的一个极个别的事例，向党提出了要遵守宪法的问题，是极为错误的。我所根据的事例，不但是极个别的，而且事后检查起来，我所提供的事例并不是党的政策的错误。上海市委制定房改政策时，是已经说明了以出租房屋为界限的，至于其中有个别作为生活资料的房屋也纳入了公私合营，那是因为这一部分房屋是连带在整个出租房屋中而合营进去的。而我却以此提出作为生活资料的房屋不应纳入合营的意见，并用这样一个非政策性错误的事例来误解党的政策有违背宪法的地方，而建议党予以检查，这简直是给党的一种污蔑，是一种有罪的言论。
    （4）由于自己有浓厚的资产阶级的法律观点，认为法律至上，心想党在没有夺取政权之前，对于国家政治生活有所主张和行动时，只有凭借党内指示透过党员和党的工作机构传达到群众。但是已经夺取政权之后，国家机构掌握在党的手中，党的政策和指示只要是需要全国人民遵守和执行的，都可以利用国家立法机构制成法律法令，并由政府制成决议和命令颁发全国执行。而没有认识到马列主义的法制方法是要从群众中来、到群众中去，是要经过典型的实践，总结经验后才能制成法律法令的。如果照我那种建议来做，反而会使法律法令脱离实际脱离群众，反而会造成“徒法不足以自行”的后果。党为了保证政治路线的贯彻，保证政治主张的执行，颁布内部指示是完全必要的。虽然我所说的内部指示仅仅是带有法律法令性的指示。但即使是这种指示，在没有制成法律法令前，完全有必要由党在工作中去取得典型实践经验，而后再制成法律法令。因此我那种建议是错误的。
    至于我所提的关于法院、监察、律师三个部门要党分开派人领导，不应由一个党委来领导的意见，它本身的错误性质，是在于它是根源于资产阶级三权分立的政治思想的，这与无产阶级专政中党的集体领导原则是相违背的。
    （5）由于我理论学习不够，思想认识模糊，对于三大主义产生的根源没有认识，错误地直感地认为，党内与政府对口各部设在党内，参加工作的全部都是党员，就容易产生与党外人士隔离的宗派主义。又因为我不懂得党内各部的工作方法和实际情况，心想全国人民代表大会的代表一年有两次到地方去视察的机会，而党内与政府对口各部可能还没有这么多的机会到全国各地视察，那就会容易脱离实际，而产生官僚主义与主观主义。因此我建议把党内各部放在人代会内。这样既可以领导非党人士进行工作，又可以经常到全国各地进行视察，便于联系实际。没有认识到无产阶级先锋队是善于把全国人民的智慧集中起来的，是随时随地密切联系群众、联系实际的。三大主义的根源是由于资产阶级的思想和小资产阶级思想在党内的一种反映，并不是由于制度的本身产生的。
    （6）由于我有浓厚的资产阶级的政治思想和小资产阶级知识分子的自高自大的劣根性，再加以参加革命工作太迟，对于党的领导力量和党的丰富的斗争经验、工作经验了解不够，自己又没有掌握到马列主义的思想武器，这样就在右派分子向党进行污蔑攻击的时候，缺乏辨别的能力，错误地认为他们所攻击的一些问题确乎是由于制度的缺点产生的，因此，引起了自己对党领导国家方式的怀疑。这样，我就作了一个右派分子进攻党、进攻国家制度的工具，贸然地提出了那些错误的建议。
    根据上述各种使我犯错误的思想根源，检查出来我的立场是非无产阶级的，尽管我在党的领导下从事工作，但是，我和党的关系不是建立在无产阶级的立场上。
    我接受党的领导是从抗日战争时期开始的，那个时候，我的思想是属于小资产阶级知识分子爱国思想的范畴，因为党当时所提出的口号是团结抗日，而我同白区的其他知识分子一样痛恨蒋介石那种攘外先安内的反人民反革命的亡国主张。因此，在党的号召之下，我感到国家有了生机，这样就凭借着小资产阶级的思想感情热爱党，靠拢党，决心跟着党走。解放以后，由于党领导人民革命事业的成功，由于党使国家得到了空前的统一，由于党提高了国家的国际地位，由于党领导了国家建设的各方面的成就，我对于党还是爱戴的。但是这种爱戴党与无产阶级爱戴党是有区别的，我爱党是由于党把国家搞好了，并不是把党当作我自己生命一样地去爱她。加上，解放后，自己与党的关系不够密切，在工作中存在着浓厚的作客思想，这样，我就自己不知不觉地自外于党。在整风运动中间，谁要是提不要党来领导国家，那我是反对的，我这种反对，不是为了维护党的领导，而是为了维护国家（我这个国家的概念还是属于资产阶级的国家范畴）。因为，我相信除了共产党领导国家之外，不相信有任何其他党派可以把国家领导好。但是当别人提到党的工作的缺点和个别党员的缺点时，我并没有站在党的立场，采取正确的态度，而是站在第三者的立场来对待别人所提的意见。有时我自己还站在与党对立的立场向党提批评的意见。
    由于自己的立场没有转变到无产阶级方面来，对党没有建立起血肉相关的思想感情，没有很好地主动地从党领导革命事业方面、领导各种伟大的社会改革运动方面、领导社会主义的建设方面的各种伟大的成就，去认识党的领导力量和组织路线的坚强性与正确性。反而把工作中的个别缺点和错误夸大成为整体的缺点和错误，动摇自己对党的信心。因而，在复杂的阶级斗争面前辨明不了方向，辨别不了正确的意见和错误的意见。我没有用捍卫党、捍卫人民事业的忠实的心情去向反党反人民的一群恶棍进行斗争，而自己反而受到那种反党反人民的气氛的影响，也发出了反党反人民的错误言论。如果不是党及时领导全国人民向右派分子进行反击，我想我会很危险地堕落成为人民的罪人的。
    （二）
    由于上述一系列反动思想根源和立场的错误，使我提出了极其反动的那样四点建议，开始时我不认识到这四点建议的反动性质，自认为我的建议是希望党加强对国家机构的领导，还认识不到它的危害性。经过各方面的批判和帮助，经过再学习无产阶级专政的理论和刘委员长在“八大”会上的政治报告，邓小平副总理修改党章的报告，两篇论无产阶级专政的历史经验，毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话和周总理的政府工作报告，以及人民日报有关整风的社论，我才认识到我的四点建议错误的严重性。现在，我的思想是很明确地认识了在我们国家的社会主义事业中必须要实行无产阶级专政，才能完成这种艰难复杂、曲折和巨大的历史任务。
    无产阶级专政必须要经过无产阶级的政党——共产党来实现，中国共产党的领导力量是坚强的，它领导了中国人民推翻了反动统治，赶走了帝国主义，建立了人民民主的政权，实行了一系列的社会改革，现在正在领导着全国人民向建设社会主义的前途迈进。中国共产党掌握马列主义的思想武器，它和工农群众像心脏和身体一样紧密地结合在一起，它的力量是强大的，它的一切措施都是从最大多数人民的最大利益出发的，它随时随地联系实际，因此它的政治路线和组织路线都是正确的。中国的党是经过了几十年的革命斗争历史才取得了政权的。因此，它的斗争经验和工作经验是丰富的。它善于把全国人民的智慧集中起来，并且把这种智慧变成为统一的意志和有纪律的行动。像这样的党领导我们还有什么不可信赖的呢？我对于这一切，过去虽也曾学习过，但是，由于自己的反动思想没有挖掘，学习只停留在字面上和概念方面，没有深入联系自己的思想实际，没有深入结合新中国所以取得胜利的实际情况，来深刻地想一想。因此，这些学习都没有在我的思想上生根，反动思想的歪风一吹，就把学习得来的一些概念都吹倒了，反动的资产阶级的政治理论占居了上风，妄想用资产阶级的一套政治理论和工作方法来代替无产阶级专政的理论和工作方法，而忽略了资产阶级革命的性质和无产阶级革命的性质本质上是不同的。资产阶级革命是在资产阶级的经济基础已从封建经济的基础上长出来以后才进行革命的，资产阶级夺取政权之后，它的任务是保障和促使原有的资产阶级的经济基础向前发展，因此夺取政权就是完成了资产阶级革命的目的。国家机器就成为资产阶级专政的唯一工具。但是，无产阶级革命是在社会主义的经济基础还没有建立之前来进行的，夺取政权只是无产阶级革命任务的开始，而不是终结。无产阶级夺取政权之后，它的任务是要摧垮旧的经济基础，从而建立新的社会主义的经济基础。它要消灭剥削，而建立起没有剥削的人人平等的社会。它要为绝大多数人民的繁荣幸福的生活创造出美满的前景。具体到中国来说，党夺取政权之后，要根本改变半封建半殖民地的经济基础，而建立起理想的社会主义社会。这一任务是空前艰巨的。没有党的领导，没有党的一套完备充实的组织系统，没有整套的无产阶级专政的体系，这一巨大的历史任务是无法完成的。如果按照我的四点建议作，那就会在国家政治生活中取消党的领导，那就会限制党在政策思想方面的领导，那就会把党放在国家之下，而不是成为国家的核心力量来领导国家。
    尤其，由于我的思想方法的片面性和主观性，以及自己站在自外于党的立场，对于个别党员在工作中的错误渲染成党的错误，怀疑党、不信任党，而认为党的领导方式和方法应该有所修正，这样，我所犯的错误就更加严重。
    经过这一次剧烈的阶级斗争，我受到了深刻的教育，由于自己犯了这样严重的错误，发出了反党反人民的有罪言论，经过痛苦的检查和严格的思想斗争，我才认识到知识分子改造的重要性。一个知识分子，如果不经过彻底的思想改造，不具备工人阶级的世界观，不掌握马列主义的思想武器，就不可能站稳人民的立场，和党建立起血肉相关的思想感情，旧的反动思想反动立场也不可能彻底改变。只要立场不转变过来，只要反动的思想还或多或少的存在，那么，随时随地都会使自己犯严重的错误：看问题，提意见，处理工作，待人接物都不会是正确的。今天不犯错误，明天还会犯。在这个问题上不犯错误，对那个问题上还会犯错误。甚至于在复杂的阶级斗争的面前，自己辨明不了方向，造成“一失足成千古恨”的惨痛教训。
    通过这次阶级斗争，我已经明确地认识了自己，我要坚决地在党的教育下和同志们的帮助下，痛恨地否定旧的我，而在新的觉悟的基础上逐渐地使新的我成长起来。这就是我向党和同志们提出的保证。
