Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch Beijing Scientists yesterday continued to expose the conspiracy of the drafters of the anti-socialist science program of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. This was the third symposium held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to criticize this program. At the same time, Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a self-criticism of his anti-socialist remarks at the meeting.

Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, President of the Academy.

Wang Baoren, a researcher at the Institute of Chemistry, said that there is a sentence in the reactionary science program: "Scientists over the age of sixty should not do administrative work." When Wang Baoren exposed the conspiracy behind this sentence, he said that the president and vice presidents of the Academy of Sciences, except for Vice President Zhang Jingfu, are all over sixty years old. The meaning of this sentence is to ask the presidents and vice presidents over the age of sixty to step down, and let Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, who are under the age of sixty, take over. Vice President Zhang, although under the age of sixty, should also step down, because Zeng Zhaolun has another so-called "laymen cannot lead experts." I very much doubt whether Zeng Zhaolun understands every tiny part of organic chemistry. Every scientist only understands his own very narrow field. The real expert is the one who grasps all the laws of science, and that is the Party. Only the Party can lead science.

Hua Luogeng continued to make self-criticism yesterday and exposed the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance regarding the anti-socialist science program.

Du Qinghua, a professor at Tsinghua University, exposed Qian Weichang's long-term reactionary words and deeds.

Fu Chengyi, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics, based on his understanding of Qian Weichang's character for more than 20 years, refuted Qian Weichang's lies in his self-criticism that he was "misled and exploited." He said that Qian Weichang is not so easily exploited. Qian has extreme personal heroism and sometimes deliberately distorts facts. In order to achieve personal goals, he can use any means. Qian often plays two-faced tricks among friends.

Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a self-criticism of his slanderous anti-socialist remarks against the Party and the government at the meeting yesterday. Tao Menghe said: "In the conversation I published in Ta Kung Pao (June 16), it can be said that the whole article is full of intolerable errors.

I said, "One of the reasons hindering the development of senior intellectuals is some errors and deviations in the implementation of policies in the past, such as the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' campaigns, ideological remolding, etc., which hurt some senior intellectuals. The adjustment of departments and teaching reforms also hurt a group of people." Here, I emphasized the errors and deviations in the implementation of important policies in our country, without mentioning their importance and achievements. This is because in my mind, I only paid attention to scientific workers in the old society, to the point that I even forgot the superiority of the country's five major movements and cultural and educational policies. I admit that this is completely wrong.

I said, "Especially social sciences, it's like a science has been uprooted." I didn't consider that the overall adjustment of departments and teaching reform was planned and carried out step by step, and was completely correct, but I insisted on citing the social science disciplines as being uprooted. This is because I have a bias towards social sciences.

I said, "Cultural and educational policies did not take into account accepting the past heritage and developing on the original basis, especially social sciences were even more tragic." This is a slander against the Party's cultural and educational policies, or at least it should be said to be a misunderstanding of our cultural and educational policies. Accepting the national heritage and promoting the excellent traditions of our national culture are important contents of the Party's cultural and educational policies, and the achievements in this area are also very significant. My erroneous statement is again due to my preference and bias towards bourgeois social sciences.

I said, "The past approach to senior intellectuals was: negate everything in the past and sever history. It would be good if we could get rid of the old people and do a good job of cultivating successors. But the biggest mistake is the policy towards students studying abroad." Here, I criticized the policy towards students studying abroad as being wrong in general. What I said about negating everything in the past and severing history is completely contrary to the facts. The Party and the government have been very considerate in arranging and taking care of intellectuals from the old society, including bourgeois social scientists. These are things that I have personally experienced, but I am slandering the country's intellectual policy.

Regarding catching up with the world's advanced level in twelve years, I said: "I boldly say that under the current circumstances, we will not be able to catch up." In fact, many of our disciplines have already caught up with the world's advanced scientific level.

I said, "We are almost five generations behind in science." This erases the large number of young people who have been trained in the eight years since liberation, which is absurd. This is another example of distorting facts to support my thesis (successors).

I said, "Ignorance is really harmful." I used such words to ridicule the leadership in the field of social sciences, which is an extremely bad attitude. This shows that I myself still retain the despicable style of bourgeois intellectuals who are arrogant and think highly of themselves.

Tao Menghe said that, looking at his entire conversation published in Ta Kung Pao, the publication of these opinions was at a time when right-wing elements were frantically attacking the Party, and it actually played a role in supporting the right-wing elements.

Yesterday, Tao Menghe said in his self-criticism at the meeting: "I don't remember what I said at the Party's rectification group meeting at the Academy of Sciences, but of course there were many mistakes. What I remember is that I deeply pitied the Chinese bourgeois social scientists and said that they had suffered a 'holocaust'. It is completely absurd to use the word 'holocaust' to describe old society sociologists."

At a forum convened by the Party Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on June 8, in addition to saying that "intellectuals have suffered a holocaust," Tao Menghe also made the following fallacies: "Although the Kuomintang was corrupt, it had a group of capable people."

"Our current cadres are incompetent and cannot do things... The Kuomintang has many traditions that we have not used, we have severed them, especially talents have not been brought into play." "Our country's intellectuals, especially scientists, are missing five generations (note: Tao Menghe calculates four years of university graduation as one generation, starting from the War of Resistance Against Japan, a total of five generations). There is a big gap in the middle. Is there any hope for the new generation? It cannot be said that there is none, but it is not great." "Class struggle is hateful, and using it for construction is the worst thing, it is the opposite of unity, it is destruction." "The current relationship between the Party and the masses is not good, mainly because the party members are not capable enough." "I hope the Party can realize this: if millions of cadres are not good, the socialist cause will be full of holes."

Yan Jici focused on criticizing Tao Menghe's absurd remarks in his speech yesterday. He pointed out that Tao kept saying that "the Kuomintang has many talents and is capable." These remarks, coming from the mouth of a vice president of the Academy of Sciences, are shocking, because Tao himself knows that many facts are not as he said. Yan Jici also cited some facts to illustrate that the scientific undertaking during the Kuomintang period was far from being comparable to that after liberation. Taking building houses as an example, the houses built by the Academia Sinica before liberation would not exceed 100,000 square meters, and the houses built by the Peiping Research Institute in 20 years would not exceed 5,000 square meters, which is not as much as the construction area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in one year this year. Now the Party and the state take care of scientists' work and life in every possible way. He said that according to his memory, Tao, when working at the Academia Sinica during the Kuomintang period, had once blushed over two bags of American relief flour. Such a thing could not happen now.

Yang Zhongjian pointed out that Tao's self-criticism is not profound. Some of the reactionary remarks made by Tao are actually footnotes to the reactionary science program. The third part of the reactionary science program mainly aims to restore bourgeois social sciences, and Tao's talk mentions this issue in several places. Xiang Da's speech, as well as some of Xiang Da's speeches on other occasions, are also very bad. In the current stage of deepening the struggle against the rightists, Xiang Da should also examine himself.

Scientists Liu Dagan, Hou Wailu, Guan Zhaozhi, Fan Wenlan, Shi Luji and others also spoke at the meeting yesterday.

### 科学院座谈会上反驳“外行不能领导内行”的谬论  只有党才能真正领导好科学  陶孟和对自己的反社会主义言论作了初步检查

    科学院座谈会上反驳“外行不能领导内行”的谬论
    只有党才能真正领导好科学
    陶孟和对自己的反社会主义言论作了初步检查
    本报特约新华社专稿　北京科学家昨天继续揭露民盟中央的反社会主义科学纲领制订人的阴谋。这是中国科学院举行的第三次批判这个纲领的座谈会。同时，中国科学院副院长陶孟和在会上检讨了他的反社会主义言论。
    昨天的会由院长郭沫若主持。
    化学研究所研究员王葆仁说，反动科学纲领中有这样一句话：“六十岁以上的科学家不要做行政工作”。王葆仁揭穿这句话的阴谋时说，科学院的院长、副院长除了张劲夫副院长以外，都是六十岁以上的人。这句话的意思就是要六十岁以上的院长、副院长下台，让六十岁以下的曾昭抡、钱伟长上台。张副院长虽然不满六十岁也还是要下台，因为曾昭抡还有另一条所谓“外行不能领导内行”。我很怀疑曾昭抡是不是懂得有机化学中的每一个微小部分，每个科学家也只懂得他的很狭的本行，真正的内行是掌握一切科学规律的人，那就是党，只有党能领导科学。
    华罗庚昨天继续作了自我检讨，并且揭露了章、罗联盟关于反社会主义科学纲领的阴谋。
    清华大学教授杜庆华揭露了钱伟长长期以来的反动言行。
    地球物理研究所研究员傅承义根据二十多年他对钱伟长的为人的了解，驳斥了钱伟长在检讨中说是
  “误入歧途，受人利用”的谎话。他说，钱伟长并不是那么容易轻易受人利用的。钱有极端的个人英雄主义，有时故意歪曲事实。为了达到个人目的，可以不择手段。钱在朋友间经常玩弄两面手法。
    中国科学院副院长陶孟和昨天在会上检讨了他的诽谤党和政府的反社会主义言论。陶孟和说：“我在大公报（6月16日）上发表的谈话里，可以说全篇充满了不能容忍的错误。
    我说“阻碍高级知识分子发展的原因之一，是过去执行政策中的一些错误和偏向，如‘三反’‘五反’、思想改造等运动伤害了一些高级知识分子，院系调整、教学改革也伤害了一批人。”在这里我强调了我们国家重要政策执行中的错误和偏向，而不说它们的重要性和成绩。这是因为在我的心目中，只注意到旧社会科学工作者，以至连国家的五大运动、文教政策的优越性都忘掉了。我承认这是完全错误的。
    我说“特别是社会科学一门科学等于连根都拔掉了。”我没有考虑整个院校调整教学改革是有计划的，有步骤的，并且完全是正确的，而偏偏举出社会科学学科来说是连根拔掉，这是我偏爱社会科学。
    我说“文教政策没有照顾接受过去遗产，在原有的基础上发展，特别是社会科学更惨”。这是诬蔑党的文教政策，至少也应该说是误解我们的文教政策。而接受民族遗产、发扬我国民族文化的优秀传统，是党的文教政策的重要内容，这方面的成绩也是十分巨大的。我的错误说法又是我对资产阶级社会科学偏爱偏好在那里作祟。
    我说“过去对高级知识分子的做法是：否定过去一切，割断历史。如果把过去一班人弄掉，而能把接班人搞好也好。但是最大的错误是对留学生的政策。”我这里笼统地批判了留学生政策是错误的。我所说否定过去一切，割断历史完全是违反事实。党和政府对从旧社会来的知识分子，包括资产阶级的社会科学家在内，对他们的安排和照顾是十分周到的。这些是我所身受的，但却诽谤国家的知识分子政策。
    对于十二年里赶上世界先进水平，我说：“我大胆说一句，像现在这样的情况，赶不上”。事实上，我们现在有许多门学科已经赶上世界先进科学水平了。
    我说“我们在科学上几乎缺五代”。把解放以来八年间所培养的一大批一大批的青年都给抹杀了，这是荒谬的。这又是歪曲事实以支持我的论题（接班人）的一例。
    我说“无知，实在害人不浅”。我用这种字眼嘲弄社会科学领导方面，乃是态度极端恶劣的表现。这说明了我自己还保存着资产阶级知识分子自高自大目空一切的卑劣作风。
    陶孟和说，通观他在大公报上发表的全篇谈话，发表这些意见正值右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，实际上起了为右派分子张目的作用。
    昨天陶孟和在会上的检讨中说：“对于在科学院党的整风小组上如何说的，已经记不清楚，当然是错误极多。我记得的，是对于中国资产阶级社会科学家们深致悯惜，曾说他们受了‘浩劫’。用‘浩劫’两字形容旧社会学家是十分荒谬的说法。”
    陶孟和在6月8日中国科学院党组召开的一次座谈会上除了说
  “知识分子遭受了一次浩劫”外，还发表了下列一些谬论：“国民党虽腐败，但有一批能干事的人”。
  “我们现在的干部能力差，不能做事……国民党有许多传统我们没有用，我们割断了，特别是人材没有发挥作用。”“我们国家知识分子特别是科学家，缺少了五代（按：陶孟和把大学四年毕业算为一代，从抗战算起共五代）。当中空了一大段。新的一代有无希望？不能说一点没有，但是不大。”“阶级斗争是仇恨的，用来进行建设最为坏事，和团结正相反，是破坏。”“现在所有的党群间的关系不好，主要出于党员能力不够。”“希望党能认识到这一点：几百万干部不好，社会主义事业一定是百孔千疮。”
    严济慈在昨天的发言中着重批判了陶孟和的荒谬言论。他指出，陶口口声声说“国民党的人才多，能干。”这些言论，出自一位科学院副院长的口里是令人吃惊的，因为陶本人就知道很多事实并不如他所说的那样。严济慈还列举了一些事实来说明国民党时期的科学事业是远不能和解放后相对比的。就以盖房子来说，解放前的中央研究院所盖的房子不会超过十万平方公尺，北平研究院在二十年内所盖的房子也不超过五千平方公尺，抵不上中国科学院今年一年的建筑面积。现在党和国家对科学家的工作和生活方面照顾更是无微不至。他说根据他的记忆，陶在国民党时期中央研究院工作时，就曾为两袋美国救济面粉闹得面红耳赤。现在就不可能发生这样的事情。
    杨锺健指出，陶的检讨是不深刻的。陶发表的一些反动言论，实际上是给反动的科学纲领作了注脚。反动的科学纲领第三部分主要是要恢复资产阶级的社会科学，陶的谈话中有好几处提到这个问题。向达的发言，以及向达在其他场合的一些发言也很不好，在当前反击右派斗争更深入开展的阶段，向达也应该检查。
    昨天在会上发言的还有科学家柳大纲、侯外庐、关肇直、范文澜、施履吉等。
