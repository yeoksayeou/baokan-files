    Dike · Reservoir

    Dike
    On the banks of the flooding Luo River, we built a long dike.
    This is the wish of generations of ancestors!
    The Luo River, though so narrow, when the spring floods come, it will use its white breast to inundate this boundless field. The raging waves can swallow hundreds of acres of land.
    The dike, this should be the wish of our many cooperatives!
    When the high dike stands tall on the edge of the Luo River, when the weeping willows on the dike sway in the wind, the dike is like a giant arm, powerfully suppressing the Luo River's unruly character; no! It blocks the disasters and poverty that have been brought to us for thousands of years.
    The Luo River no longer floods...
    When the river water flows into the fields according to our instructions, what we see is no longer a vast expanse of white, but a field of emerald green rice paddies.
    Reservoir
    The reservoir is like a clear mirror, reflecting the strange mountains.
    When the iron gate of the sluice is opened, the gushing water is like a bolt of white silk that can never be completely woven, spreading over the fields for thousands upon thousands of feet.
    The reservoir, after long days and months, has stored every tiny stream given to it by mountain springs and brooks, and then quietly lies at the foot of the high mountains, allowing the mountains to surround it in circles.
    When the spring breeze calls in your ear, when we prepare to sow the strong grain seeds, you are using your own blood to nurture this fertile land. At this time, although you are thin and withered, at this time, although we can no longer see your serene appearance, in every irrigation canal, we hear your joyful laughter.
    Reservoir, you accommodate every drop of water rushing towards you, and can irrigate the earth with every drop of your own blood; no wonder every ear of grain, every tuft of flower and grass in the field, nods to you in respect for your broad mind.

    堤·水库
    李耕
    堤
    在泛滥的骆河边上，我们筑起了一座长堤。
    这是多少代祖先的愿望啊！
    骆河，虽是这般的狭窄，当春汛来临的时候，它会用自己白色的胸脯，弥漫这无边的田园。汹涌的波涛，能吞下千百亩田地。
    堤，这该是我们多少个合作社的愿望啊！
    当高高的堤岸，矗立在骆河的边上，当堤上的垂柳在风中摇摆，堤，就像一只巨大的臂膀，有力地镇压着骆河横蛮的性格；不！是挡住了千年来给我们带来的灾害和贫困。
    骆河，不再泛滥了。……
    当河水按照我们的指使流入田地的时候，看见的，再不是白茫茫一片，而是一片碧绿碧绿的禾田。
    水库
    水库像一面明净的镜子，映照着奇怪的群山。
    当水闸的铁壋启开了，奔泻而下的流水像一匹永远织不完的白绸，千丈万丈地铺在田野上。
    水库，费尽了漫长的日月，容积了山泉小涧给它的每一粒细流，然后默默地躺在高山的脚下，让山峦团团地环绕着它。
    当春风在你的耳边呼唤，当我们准备播下那壮实的谷种，你，在用自己的血液，哺育着这肥沃的土地。这时，你虽然瘦枯了，这时，虽然再看不见你恬静的容貌，可是在每一条水圳中，却听见你欢快的笑声。
    水库，你容纳了向你奔来的每一粒水，又能将自己的每一粒血液灌溉大地；难怪原野上的每一支谷穗，每一撮花草，都在为你宽宏的胸襟点头表示敬意。
