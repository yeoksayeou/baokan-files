    Unfolding a Socialist Great Debate in the Countryside
    The Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative Understands the Correctness of the Unified Purchase and Sales Policy More Clearly Through Debate

    (Our Dispatch) According to the Shanxi Daily, with the assistance of the work team of the Xiangfen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jia Zhuang Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative launched a major debate on the state's unified grain purchase and sales policy. Through the debate, the farmers correctly understood the relationship between individual interests and national interests and criticized the erroneous idea of wanting to keep more rations and sell less surplus grain. All members of the cooperative unanimously decided to hand over the best wheat for public grain and sell surplus grain to support the country.
    Over the years, the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative has been very active in handing over public grain and selling surplus grain. However, after this year's wheat harvest, as soon as the work team arrived in the village, the members developed resistance. Some people said, "This year our wheat yield is less than last year, can we still sell surplus grain?" "This is a matter for the cooperative cadres; sell if they sell, give if they give. Anyway, if it's not enough to eat, we'll just ask the cooperative for it." The cooperative cadres were also afraid of selling too much surplus grain, making it difficult to explain to the members.
    Accounting for Three Bills
    After careful study, the work team believed that in order to do a good job in grain purchase, it was necessary to start with strengthening political and ideological work. In order to understand the specific situation of the Five-Star Cooperative in terms of grain, they worked with the cooperative cadres to calculate three accounts. The first account calculated the output, knowing that the Five-Star Cooperative was not a production reduction cooperative, but a production increase cooperative. The second account calculated how much should be sold. According to the actual situation and the "three fix" method, it was determined that 50,000 jin of surplus grain and exchanged wheat could be sold. The third account calculated last year's retention, understanding that the members distributed a lot last year and still had some old reserves; selling a little more surplus grain this year would not affect the actual rations.
    After calculating the three accounts, the cooperative cadres came to a clearer understanding. After the task of selling surplus grain was determined, the cooperative separately convened member representative meetings by team. At the member representative meetings, a major debate was launched based on the members' thoughts.
    Is the Unified Purchase and Sales Policy Good?
    When discussing this issue, one member suggested: Unified purchase and sales will not let people starve to death, but it will make people thin. Before he finished speaking, an elderly member slammed the table and stood up, saying: "That's nonsense! Is anyone here thin? We still remember the old society's 'poor people out of luck, expensive buying and cheap selling', right? At that time, when the wheat came down, we farmers wanted to spend some money to sell the grain to the rich; when the lean season came, if we wanted to buy it back, the grain price would soar. Who has suffered this kind of loss now? If it weren't for unified purchase and sales, would it work?" Then, everyone talked about the benefits of grain supply after liberation. Some people said that in the past, farmers who suffered disasters either fled their homes or starved to death; now, the state transports grain from far away to supply and relieve them. Who paid this money before? Some grain-deficient households said: Not to mention the disaster, even for us grain-deficient households, if it weren't for the unified purchase and sales policy, where would we get grain to eat? In short, everyone agreed that the unified purchase and sales policy is beneficial to farmers in every way.
    Is the Retention Standard Low?
    Some people felt that although the unified purchase and sales policy was good, they thought that the purchase was a bit too much, and 420 jin of grain per person was not enough to eat. More people believed that with cooperation, they should eat better. Others believed that selling more surplus grain was okay, but farmers work harder than city people and have bigger appetites. Everyone launched a debate on the above ideas. One member said: Whether it is enough to eat or not depends on the facts and conscience. Some people see others reporting a shortage of grain, and they also report it, only wanting wheat and not coarse grains. Is this a real shortage or a fake shortage? Our cooperative's Wang Huizong reported it when he saw others reporting it. In the end, he didn't get any grain, and he wasn't even hungry for a single meal. Is this not enough to eat? How many grain farmers in the old society could eat 420 jin of grain? Another elderly member said: To be honest, 420 jin of retention is enough for most members. Besides, this year's grain kernels are more full than last year's, yield more flour, and the distribution of grain is not like last year, regardless of how much each person wants, big or small. An old lady said: The daughters-in-law should tighten the mouths of the jars a little, and they can still save some. Finally, the members unanimously agreed that there was no problem with retaining 420 jin of rations per year.
    Who is Supporting Whom?
    During the debate, someone also put forward the erroneous statement that "workers eat less white flour, but they earn more money, so they can eat in restaurants." Most members disagreed with this statement. Some members said: "Workers earn more money, but their expenses are also high. Just to eat more white flour and eat in restaurants every day, won't their wives and children live? Besides, grain is grown in the fields, not in restaurants. If we don't sell surplus grain, what will you ask the restaurants to sell?" Someone talked about the specific facts of workers supporting farmers. He said, "Aren't we also using sprayers and 666 powder made by workers? Just take that 75-horsepower boiler machine; it has turned our cooperative's one thousand acres of dry land into paddy fields. This year, one mu of dry land yields 100 jin of wheat, and one mu of paddy field yields 400 jin. If the worker elder brothers don't support farmers in increasing production, by ourselves, we wouldn't be able to yield 400 jin of wheat even if we turned the dry land upside down." Everyone also calculated that there were more than 160 people in the whole village who were outside, and each person was supplied with 370 jin of grain per year, which would require more than 60,000 jin. The surplus grain sold by the whole cooperative is not even enough for them to eat. Someone said: "This is not us supporting the country, but the country supporting us." This calculation made the members laugh out loud.
    The Result of the Debate
    Through this major debate, the members received a socialist ideological education, and the political atmosphere in the cooperative was completely renewed. The members unanimously proposed: to use the best wheat to hand over public grain and sell surplus grain. All of the 106,991 jin of public grain that the cooperative should hand over has been transported to the national warehouse, and 50,000 jin of surplus grain and exchanged wheat have also been prepared and are being transported one after another. The members also plan to work harder in the autumn fields, strive for a bumper autumn harvest, and reduce the amount of exchanged grain that the country has to return. Now, all members have turned to intensive autumn field processing and have come up with many measures to increase production.

### 在农村中展开社会主义的大辩论  五星农业社对统购统销政策的正确性愈辩愈明

    在农村中展开社会主义的大辩论
    五星农业社对统购统销政策的正确性愈辩愈明
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：在中共襄汾县委工作组的帮助下，贾庄五星农业生产合作社，对国家的粮食统购统销政策展开了大辩论。经过辩论，农民正确认识了个人利益和国家利益的关系，批判了想多留口粮、少卖余粮的错误思想。全社社员一致决定把最好的小麦交公粮和卖余粮，支援国家。
    历年来，五星农业社不论交公粮、卖余粮，都很积极。然而，今年麦收后，工作组刚一到村，社员们却发生了抵触情绪。有人说：“今年咱们的麦子比去年打的少，还能卖余粮？”“这是社干部们的事，卖就卖，粜就粜，反正不够吃了咱再向社里要。”社干部也怕多卖余粮，不好向社员交代。
    算清三笔账
    工作组经过仔细研究，认为要想作好粮食征购工作，必须从加强政治思想工作入手。他们为了弄清五星社在粮食方面的具体情况，和社干部共同算了三笔账。第一笔账算产量，知道五星社今年不是减产社，而是增产社。第二笔账算应当卖多少。根据实际情况和三定办法，确定可卖余粮、互换小麦五万斤。第三笔账算去年的留量，了解去年社员们分得多，还有些老底子；今年多卖一点余粮，不至影响实际口粮。
    经过算三笔账，社干部想通了。在卖余粮的任务确定后，社内便分头按队召开了社员代表会。在社员代表会上，根据社员的思想，展开了大辩论。
    统购统销政策好不好？
    在讨论这个问题的时候，有个社员提出：统购统销不让饿死人，就是把人饿瘦了。话音没落，一位老年社员一拍桌子站起来说：这是瞎说！在座的那个人瘦了？咱们总还记得旧社会“穷汉倒灶，贵糴贱粜”的事情吧。那时候，麦子下来了，咱庄稼人想花点钱，把粮食卖给有钱人；到青黄不接的时候，再想往回买，粮价一涨千丈。现在谁吃过这种亏？要不是统购统销行吗？接着，大家谈到了解放后粮食供应的好处。有人说，在早先，遭了灾的农民，不是离家逃难，就是落个饿死；现在，国家从老远的地方运来粮食供应和救济。以前，谁贴这份钱？有的缺粮户说：不用说遭了灾，就俺这缺粮户吧，要不是统购统销政策，哪能有粮食吃。总之，大家一致认为统购统销政策，对农民有百利而无一害。
    留量标准低不低？
    有些人感到统购统销政策虽然好，但是认为就是购的多了些，每人留四百二十斤粮食不够吃。更多的人认为合作化了，应该吃得好一些。还有人认为多卖点余粮是可以的，但是农民比城市的人劳动多，饭量大。大家针对上述思想展开了辩论。一位社员说：够吃不够吃，也得凭事实，也得凭良心。有人看着别人报缺粮，他也报，光要麦子不要粗粮食，这是真缺还是假缺？咱们社的王回宗，见人家报他也报，最后没拿上粮食，也没见他饿着一顿。这是不够吃？旧社会有几个种庄稼的人能吃到四百二十斤粮食？又一位老年社员说：说句良心话，留四百二十斤，大部分社员够吃了，再说，今年的粮颗颗比去年饱满，出面多，分粮食也不是像去年似地不管大口小口要多少都是多少。一位老大娘说：媳妇们把缸口口把紧些，也还能节省。最后，社员们一致认为每年留四百二十斤口粮没问题。
    到底谁支援谁？
    辩论进行中，又有人提出了“工人吃的白面少，但是他们赚钱多，可以下饭馆”的错误言论。大部分社员不同意这种说法。有的社员说：工人赚钱多，花销也大，光为了多吃些白面每天下饭馆，老婆娃娃不活了？再说粮食是地里打的，又不是饭铺里长的，咱要不卖余粮，你叫饭铺卖啥呢。有人谈到了工人支援农民的具体事实。他说，咱们不是也在用工人制造的喷雾器和六六六粉吗？就说那部七十五马力的锅驼机吧，把咱们社的一千几百亩旱地变成水地了。今年一亩旱地打麦一百斤，一亩水地四百斤。要是工人老大哥不支援农民增产，凭咱们，把旱地翻个个儿也打不到四百斤麦。大家还计算了一下，全村共有一百六十多人在外边，每人一年按三百七十斤粮食供应，就得六万多斤，全社卖的这点余粮还不够他们吃。有人说：“这那是咱们支援国家，还得国家支援咱们哩。”算得社员们哄堂大笑了。
    辩论的结果
    经过这一场大辩论，社员们都受到了一次社会主义思想教育，社内的政治空气焕然一新。社员们一致提出：要用最好的小麦交公粮、卖余粮。社里应交的十万零六千九百九十一斤公粮，已全部运往国家仓库，五万斤余粮和互换小麦，也已准备停当，正陆续交运。社员们还打算，在秋田里多下点工，争取秋粮大丰收，少让国家还给互换的粮食。现在，全体社员已转入紧张的秋田加工，并想出许多增产措施。
