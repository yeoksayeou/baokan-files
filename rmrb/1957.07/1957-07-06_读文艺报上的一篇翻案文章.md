Reading a "Reversal of Verdict" Article in the Wenyi Bao (Literary Gazette)
Yao Wenyuan

I used to enjoy reading Wenyi Bao, and I still do, but the reasons for that "enjoyment" have changed significantly. I liked reading it in the past because it published many theoretical articles, and I wanted to find theoretical issues in Wenyi Bao. Recently, I still like to read it because I want to find something strange or sensationalist in it, like "lazybones," "masters," "worth ten times more," "men worse than dogs," and so on. The editors may think that these curses full of hatred are all good articles.

If someone is not satisfied with my view above and insists that I use extremely concise words to describe the most obvious characteristics of this eleventh issue of Wenyi Bao, then I can only use one sentence to explain: there are a lot of "reversal of verdict" articles.

Originally, there could be all kinds of "reversal of verdict" articles. One could use Marxism to overturn dogmatism, or use "flexible application" of "Marxism" (to borrow a gentleman's phrase) to overturn Marxism, or cleverly use revisionism to overturn dogmatism, but in reality, it is still about overturning Marxism-Leninism. In Wenyi Bao, these three types of articles seem to be mixed together.

In the eleventh issue of Wenyi Bao, there is a "reversal of verdict" article called "Talking about the Issue of 'The Present is Not as Good as the Past' from the Experience of a Miscellaneous Essay," which uses "true Marxism" to overturn the case of the People's Daily editorial department. This author wrote an essay called "The Drum, Oh, Return!", calling for the "return" of the drum from feudal society, so that it could "seek justice" for the "common people." The article was returned by the People's Daily editorial department because the ending had a feeling of "the present is not as good as the past." Therefore, the author angrily wrote this new article to insist on his point of view to the end.

Why does this author admire the "drum" of the feudal era so much? Why does he hate the present and love the past so much? It is said that: the recent facts of "leaders revealed to be high above, and the masses having no way to complain" made him feel that "the bureaucratic air of some cadres today is no less than that of 'high officials'." Since the masses in socialist society have fallen into the point of "having no way to complain," where can one open a "door" for the broad masses to "complain"? The author recommends the "drum" of the feudal era. He praises the drum with the greatest enthusiasm, and he uses vivid language to describe the drum's amazing effectiveness:

"Put the drum in front of the government, let the drumstick be in the hands of the common people, let the sound of the drum become the command of the common people, so that officials are subject to the people, which shows the preciousness of the drum.

"The drum is, after all, a symbol of the people's will!"

Imagine: in front of Party and government agencies, the drum stands tall, rightists beat the drum to "complain" for counter-revolutionaries, and "officials" immediately "obey;" landlords beat the drum to "complain" for their lost land, and "officials" also bow their heads and obey; counter-revolutionaries go to beat the drum, and "officials" also hurry to exonerate them. If any "official" hesitates slightly, he will immediately be dismissed for violating the "will of the people." ...At this time, the author will once again wave his hands and feet and repeat his famous saying:

"The drum is, after all, a symbol of the people's will!"

This picture is quite wonderful, but unfortunately, wonderful as it is, it violates the interests of the workers, peasants, and all patriotic people who want to take the socialist road, so it has to fall to the most unpleasant place. The "benefits" of this drum are indeed greater than in feudal society, because according to the little bit of shallow political common sense I have learned, the drum in feudal society was a means of maintaining order. It could alleviate some contradictions between the people and the feudal ruling class, and foster a kind of illusion of hoping to seek justice within the legal scope, so as not to resort to violent means of "rebellion." Therefore, any ruler with a little vision would use it. However, for the working people, the "justice" role of the drum is extremely small. It can only play a role when occasionally encountering an upright official. How many working people died tragically, one hundred and eight heroes were forced to Liangshan, how many times was there a cruel massacre of entire families... What grievances did the drum redress? Now this author regards it as a "symbol of the people's will" and seriously wants to move it into the political life of socialist society. Aren't the "benefits" very great? But, who exactly benefits the most? The workers and peasants support democratic centralism and the leadership of the Party. They know that without the leadership of the Party and the government, nothing can be done well. They can fully convey their opinions through their own organizations and do not need a "drum" at all; all patriotic intellectuals have freedom of speech, they can openly criticize bureaucracy, talk to leaders, and they do not need a "drum" either. However, now some anti-socialist rightists do feel "unfree," feel that they have "no way to complain"—there is no place to exercise their "will" to restore capitalist rule. With such a drum, beating and shouting frantically non-stop for twenty-four hours, so that cadres "obey" them, and put the workers, peasants, and all working people under their rule, these "benefits" of theirs are truly endless. However, what is good for the rightists is bad for the people. — So, I'm sorry. The author thinks that the drum has many "benefits," but it can only be regarded as a dream that will never be realized.

In addition to this, the author also compares the bureaucratic ideology and work style of today's cadres with "high officials." I don't know whether he hates bureaucracy, or whether he regards today's people as masters of their own affairs as "great bureaucrats." In the past, the people hated the feudal rulers. Today, it is the turn of a very small number of people who are extremely disgusted with socialist society to hate the regime led by the working class. It is very natural for them to lament "the present is not as good as the past."

    读文艺报上的一篇翻案文章
    姚文元
    我过去欢喜看文艺报，现在也还欢喜看文艺报，但那“欢喜”的原因，却有很大的改变。过去喜欢看，是因为它登载很多理论文章，想从文艺报中寻找理论上的问题；最近还喜欢看，是因为想从里面找到什么希奇古怪的事情或耸人听闻的谩骂，如“懒虫们”“老爷们”“身价十倍”“人不如狗”……之类。这些满含仇恨的诅咒，编者也许以为都是好文章。
    如果有人不满足我上面的看法，一定要我用极简洁的字眼，描绘出这十一期文艺报的最明显的特色来，我就只好用一句话来说明：翻案文章特别多。
    本来，翻案文章可以有各色各类的，可以用马克思主义去翻教条主义的案，也可以用“灵活运用”“马克思主义”（借用一位先生的话）去翻马克思主义的案，还可以巧妙地用修正主义去翻教条主义的案，实际上还是要翻马列主义的案。在文艺报上，这三类文章似乎都混合着。
    在文艺报第十一期上有一篇翻案文章，叫做“从一篇杂文的遭遇谈到‘今不如昔’的问题”，是用“真正的马克思主义”去翻人民日报编辑部的案的。这位作者写了一篇“堂鼓呀归来”，呼吁封建社会中的堂鼓“归来”，好为“老百姓”伸冤。文章被人民日报编辑部退回，理由是结尾有“今不如昔”的感觉。作者于是愤而写了这篇新的文章，把他的主张坚持到底。
    这位作者为什么会这样羡慕封建时代的“堂鼓”呢？为什么这样恶今而爱昔呢？据说是：最近“各方面揭发的领导高高在上，群众诉苦无门”的事实，使他感到“今天某些干部的官僚气，已不比‘都堂大人’逊色”。在社会主义社会中既然群众已陷入“诉苦无门”的地步，那么到哪里去开一个“门”为广大人民“诉苦”呢？作者就推荐封建时代的“堂鼓”了。他以最大的热情歌颂着堂鼓，他以生花之笔描绘着堂鼓的惊人的效能：
    “把堂鼓摆在官府门前，让鼓槌操在老百姓手里，鼓声成为老百姓的命令，使官儿们听命于民，这才显出堂鼓的难能可贵之处。
    “堂鼓，毕竟是人民意志的象征呵！”
    不妨想像一下：党政机关前面，堂鼓屹立，右派分子击鼓为反革命“诉苦”，“官儿们”马上“听命”，地主击鼓为他失去的土地“诉苦”，“官儿们”也俯首顺从；反革命去击鼓，“官儿”们也赶紧为他们开脱。如果有哪一个“官儿”竟稍有迟疑，马上以违反“人民的意志”为理由加以革职。……这时候，作者就会再一次手舞足蹈地重复他的名言：
    “堂鼓，毕竟是人民意志的象征呵！”
    这幅图画是相当美妙的，可惜美妙虽美妙，但违反了工人、农民和一切爱国人民要走社会主义的利益，也只好掉到最不美妙的地方去了。这堂鼓的“好处”也确比封建社会中要大，因为照我学到的一点浅薄的政治常识，堂鼓在封建社会是维护秩序的一种手段，它能缓和人民同封建统治阶级之间的某些矛盾，并且滋长一种希望在合法范围内伸冤诉苦的幻想，不致挺而走险，采用暴力“造反”的手段，所以凡是比较有点眼光的统治者，是会利用它的。然而对于劳动人民，堂鼓起的“伸冤”的作用是极微极微的，只有偶尔碰见一个清官时才能起一点作用。多少劳动人民惨死，一百零八个好汉逼上梁山，多少次残酷的满门抄斩的屠杀……堂鼓伸了什么冤？现在这位作者把他当作“人民意志的象征”，认真地想把它搬用到社会主义社会的政治生活中来，那“好处”不是很大么？但是，到底谁的“好处”大呢？工人农民是拥护民主集中制和党的领导的。他们知道，没有党和政府的领导，就什么事也办不好。他们有什么意见完全可以通过自己的组织上达，根本不需要“堂鼓”；一切爱国的知识分子的言论都是有自由的，他们可以公开地批评官僚主义，找领导人谈话，他们也不需要“堂鼓”，但是，现在有些反社会主义的右派分子，他们的确感到“不自由”，感到“诉苦无门”——没有地方可以行使他们恢复资本主义统治的“意志”。有了这么一个堂鼓，二十四小时不停地狂跳狂叫而击之，使干部“听命”于他们，把工人农民和一切劳动人民都放在他们的统治之下，他们的这些“好处”倒真是无穷无尽的。然而，对于右派分子有好处，对人民就有坏处。——那么，对不起。这位作者以为“好处”颇多的堂鼓，只好作为一种永不会实现的梦想。
    除此之外，作者还把今天干部中的官僚主义思想作风同“都堂大人”相提并论。我不知道，他到底是在恨官僚主义呢，还是把今天人民当家作主看作“大官僚”。过去人民仇恨封建统治者，今天呢，轮到极少数对社会主义社会极度反感的人来仇恨工人阶级领导的政权了。他们悲叹“今不如昔”是很自然的。
