Flexibly Apply Various Contract Work Methods to Strengthen Field Management Responsibility System

    Household Contracts for Land, Individual Contracts for Work: Men, Women, Young, and Old Each Use Their Strengths

    (Our report) The Fourth Production Team of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Hequ County, Shanxi Province, adopted different small-scale contracting methods for different tasks during this year's summer hoeing work. The specific methods are: (1) Household Contracts for Land: Relatively fragmented and technically light tasks, such as sowing, thinning, cultivating, weeding, and staking for cotton, tobacco, and watermelon crops, are contracted to experienced elderly cooperative members and women on a year-round basis. This allows the elderly and women to freely choose the time to complete these tasks based on their physical condition and the amount of housework they have. (2) Individual Contracts for Work: For fixed tasks and technical work, a system of permanent or temporary contracts is implemented on an individual basis. For example, watching the waterwheel and diverting water is a permanent task throughout the year, contracted to thirteen cooperative members on a fixed basis for the entire year; technical work such as operating the seeder and pulling seedlings is contracted by the team to several experienced farmers on a production segment basis, selected by the entire team. This not only gives play to the role of experienced farmers, but also ensures improved quality. (3) Group Contracts for Sections: In addition to the above various agricultural tasks, the team has also organized three work groups, with the team uniformly adjusting and arranging tasks, and team cadres dividing the leadership. Based on production needs and technical expertise, the work groups complete certain tasks with several people or one person each.
    After doing this, it outstandingly resolved three contradictions: only caring about earning work points and not caring about quality, the rational division of labor between strong and weak laborers and between experienced farmers and second-rate hands, and recording work at night and during the day. It strengthened the production responsibility of cooperative members, and the quality of agricultural work greatly improved. In the past, elderly cooperative members often had no suitable work to do, but now everyone is appropriately arranged; the team has eight elderly cooperative members over the age of sixty, who have now completed an average of sixty-one workdays, more than double the same period last year. In the past, work points were recorded every night, but now they are only recorded every ten days or half a month, so the enthusiasm of cooperative members for labor has greatly increased, and the attendance rate of male laborers has reached 100%.

    灵活运用各种包工办法，加强田间管理责任制
    户包地，人包活  男女老少各施所长
    本报讯　山西省河曲县城关乡曙明农业社第四生产队在今年夏锄工作中，不同营生采用不同的小包工办法。具体办法是：（一）户包地：把较零碎的技术轻活，如棉花、烟叶、西瓜等作物的下种、间苗、中耕锄草、打卡等按户通年包给有技术的老年社员和妇女。这样老年人和妇女可以根据体力状况和家务事多少，自由选择时间去完成。（二）人包活：对固定性的营生和技术活实行以人为单位常年包或临时包的办法。如看水车和拨水是全年固定性的营生，全年内固定包给十三个社员去干；掌耧、拔小苗等技术活由全队挑选技术老农按生产小段包给若干个人去完成。这样既发挥了老农作用，又保证了质量的提高。（三）组包片：除以上各种农活外，全队又组织了三个作业小组，由队统一调整与安排营生，队干部分工领导。作业组根据生产需要和技术特长分别几个人或一个人去完成一定的活。
    这样做了以后，突出的解决了只顾抢工分不管质量，强劳力与弱劳力、技术老农与二把手的合理分工，白天劳动和黑夜记工等三个矛盾，加强了社员的生产责任心，农活质量大大提高。过去老年社员常常没有适合的营生做，现在人人得到适当安排；全队有六十岁以上的老年社员八人，现已平均做下六十一个劳动日，比去年同期增加一倍多。过去天天黑夜记工，现在十天半月才记一次工，因此社员劳动积极性大大提高，男劳动出勤率达到百分之百。
