From Elation to Exposure
The Conspiracy of Rightist Qian Weichang Goes Bankrupt
(Our reporter Chen Baisheng) In recent days, teachers and students of Tsinghua University have been展开展开criticizing the bourgeois rightist Qian Weichang. At many meetings, teachers and students pointed out that Qian Weichang, under the guise of a scientist, launched an attack on the Party and the people. He maintained close ties with rightists such as Zhang Bojun outside the university, and engaged in provocation and incitement among teachers, students, and staff within the university, attempting to follow the path of bourgeois education, overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and seize the world for the bourgeoisie.

Since the start of the rectification campaign, Qian Weichang has been using the free forum at the university to publish inflammatory remarks, win over the masses, divide students, and attack the prestige of the Party. He misled some young people, but some young people also questioned and doubted his rightist remarks, sparking debate among the students. It was not until after the June 6th meeting was exposed that his mask was torn off. People then saw clearly that he was a rightist element with political ambitions, organized activities, and used methods of provocation and incitement to attack the Party and the people.

Spreading Flames Everywhere

"Spreading flames everywhere can incite workers and peasants, students' big-character posters make it easy to take over schools, the great blooming and contending will trigger an immediate explosion, the world will be in chaos in an instant, and the Communist Party will be finished immediately." This was the estimate of the current situation made by rightist Zhang Bojun to the six Beijing professors on June 6th. It was at such a rightist gathering that Qian Weichang, as one of the six Beijing professors, not only attended the meeting, but his speech at the meeting was most appreciated by Zhang Bojun.

On the very afternoon of attending the June 6th meeting of the six professors, several students from the Department of Dynamics, including Yu Guoning and Wu Wenquan, visited Qian Weichang. Qian Weichang thought the opportunity had come and began to spread flames. He said that the masses are currently in a state of frustration, unable to speak their minds, wanting to vent, but unable to find a topic. You are here today to find a topic. You must know that while everyone is enthusiastically engaged in the movement, there are also people crying and weeping outside, with no one caring.

Qian Weichang said that sectarian sentiments exist among the students themselves, arbitrarily dividing people into advanced, intermediate, and backward. In my opinion, advanced people are just good at saying a few nice words. Qian Weichang became excited as he spoke, saying that young people are not bold enough, with too many restrictions. I am much older than you, and I am not afraid of restrictions. If people put a hat on me, I won't wear it; I'll throw it away.

At this time, Qian Weichang also ignited the passions of more than twenty students from the Department of Physics. Some students said that some people had already signed a petition in front of the Science Hall advocating for the merger of science and engineering universities. Qian Weichang asked how many people there were. Someone replied that there were more than six hundred people. He said that this was too few, at least six thousand signatures were needed to make a big splash and let the Ministry of Higher Education see it. As the students were leaving, he said, "Go and sign it!"

Qian Weichang also said to Associate Professor Li Hengde that the students' situation was very bad and serious, and they were looking for topics everywhere. "Do you want to talk to the students? I can teach them to come and find you." Li Hengde questioned Qian Weichang, "What do you mean by this?"

Qian Weichang kept the contents of the June 6th meeting absolutely secret. When he gave a lecture at the Tsinghua Student Free Forum on June 19th, when students asked him what he had gone to Zhang Bojun for in early June, he told the students that he was talking to Zhang Bojun about science planning. However, at the enlarged meeting of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League on June 20th and June 24th, Tao Dayong and Fei Xiaotong, two of the six Beijing professors who participated in the June 6th forum, successively revealed some of the inside stories of the forum, and also revealed that Qian Weichang had said at the meeting that the characteristic of the student movement was to find a leader, and that if it joined forces with teachers, it would cause trouble, and so on. In this way, Qian Weichang's absolute secret could not be kept.

Pushing, Confusing, Denying

When Qian Weichang's remarks to the students of the Department of Dynamics were criticized by the majority of students, the momentum of the struggle against rightists in the school also grew stronger. What was Qian Weichang to do? Only retreat. He repeatedly said that the talk records were inaccurate and untrue, and that he was not responsible for them! Student Yu Guoning questioned him, "We recorded what he said during the interview, and now he denies it. This makes us very surprised. We interviewed many professors, and they all considered the published interviews to be factual. Why are Qian Weichang's words recorded incorrectly?"

Seeing that the struggle against the rightists Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji was deepening, Qian Weichang also pretended to be a good person. On June 19th, he scolded Zhang Bojun as a political careerist at the student forum, saying that he never dreamed of having contact with Zhang Bojun and Chu Anping. He acted very convincingly. However, at the enlarged meeting of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League on June 20th, Tao Dayong revealed his words and deeds at the meeting of the six professors. His secret was exposed. Let's see what he says? He said to Hong Fengbiao and other twenty students that he did not hear clearly what Zhang Bojun said because he urinated several times in the middle of the meeting.

On July 2nd and 3rd, under the unanimous criticism and questioning of the teachers and students present, he only slightly explained some of his relationships with Professor Meng Zhaoying, Professor Chang Jiong, and Associate Professor He Chengjun in the school. Then he talked about how Zeng Zhaolun had encouraged him to find out the bottom line of the cultural and educational planning, and how he had met Chu Anping through Fei Xiaotong's introduction. He said that Chu wrote him a letter on May 22nd and came to Tsinghua University to find him in person on May 26th. Chu talked to him about discussing the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries when the National People's Congress was held, and also wanted to make suggestions to Chairman Mao. Chu said that he was about to take over the Guangming Daily and that he was fighting with the Party group of the Guangming Daily. He was going to publish the news of the big-character posters on the Democracy Wall of Peking University and looked at the big-character posters of Tsinghua before leaving. Qian Weichang also talked about his relationship with Fei Xiaotong, saying that Fei Xiaotong was mainly responsible for him falling into the Zhang and Luo circle, and talked about Fei Xiaotong's use of "liaison" to carry out activities throughout the country to reflect the demands of intellectuals.

At these meetings, Qian Weichang's self-criticism did not touch on fundamental issues, which aroused everyone's anger.

Stirring up Party-Masses Relations

Many people pointed out at the meeting that inciting Party-masses relations, the relations between the Party and senior intellectuals, and the relations between the Party and young people were important methods of Qian Weichang. Qian Weichang once said that non-Party members have no future and that he has authority without power, attempting to create opposition between the Party and the masses.

Before liberation, Qian Weichang was just an ordinary professor at Tsinghua University, and he was not elected to the council. Now he has become the vice president of Tsinghua University, a member of the Academic Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a representative of the National People's Congress. He holds more than twenty positions, but he still says that the Party does not value him and does not trust him. He has great power in Tsinghua, but he still says that he has authority without power. Wu Han questioned Qian Weichang on this matter at the meeting, "Who gave you today's position? The people gave it to you! What kind of view and attitude do you have towards the Party and the people?" Professor Liang Sicheng also said emotionally at the criticism meeting against Qian Weichang, "Qian Weichang, you said that 'non-Party members have no future,' but you are not a Party member. Do you have no future! You hold more than twenty positions and are the vice president and a member of the Academic Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences! If you think you still have no future, then what is your future? Is it the same future as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji?" Professor Liang Sicheng also said that Qian Weichang's method was to hold a big election at Tsinghua and get a big signature, wanting him to exclusively control the power of Tsinghua.

Associate Professor Xu Yizhuang also revealed that Qian Weichang said, "I personally heard Qian Weichang say that only Party members have a future." Qian Weichang believes that the most important issue in Tsinghua, whether for students or teachers, is the issue of the future. Non-Party members have no future. Because of this, a female student cried to Qian Weichang several times, feeling that she had no future. Xu Yizhuang questioned Qian Weichang why he distorted the facts by saying that "only Party members have a future"? He said that Qian Weichang hoped that the whole school would rise up to "protest" the so-called issue of the future. Doing so was to try to bring down the leadership of the entire Party committee.

Want to Take the Road of Bourgeois Education

In education, Qian Weichang opposes taking the socialist road. He wants to take the road of capitalist education.

Qian Weichang said at the student free forum on May 31st that the old Tsinghua was not entirely copying the Anglo-American model, but combined it with China's reality. Professor Zhang Wei questioned, "The old Tsinghua's unplanned and untargeted education system, which praised spontaneity, was not copied from the capitalist countries of the United States and Britain? Is it socialist?" Li Jixiang said that after the Polish and Hungarian events, Qian Weichang changed to the rightist camp. His talk on training objectives published in the Guangming Daily fundamentally denied learning from the Soviet Union and denied teaching reform, proposing another training objective. Xia Zhenying said that Qian Weichang wanted to drag Tsinghua onto the capitalist road. Don't isolate it as a problem of Tsinghua. It should be seen as a component of Zhang Bojun's attack on the cultural and educational circles, and Qian Weichang is the vanguard.

Professor Jin Xiwu said, "Everyone knows that Qian Weichang published a talk on the training objectives of higher industrial schools that shocked the country in the Guangming Daily on January 7th. In this talk, he held a provocative attitude. He did not mention a word about the achievements of teaching reform, and on the contrary, he essentially denied the socialist education line of teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union. He tried to deny professional education according to certain training objectives and drag the higher education of New China back to the old road of capitalist general education before liberation. Is Qian Weichang's publication of such a talk that goes against the Party's education policy a sign of supporting the Party and willing to take the socialist road?"

Stripping off the Coat of a Versatile Scientist

Qian Weichang is also dishonest in his attitude towards scientific research. He pretends to understand when he doesn't and boasts to people that he is a "versatile scientist."

At the meeting on July 3rd, Professor Lang Shijun of the Northeast Institute of Technology, who is now working at Tsinghua University, said: "I want to expose his coat of a pseudo-scientist. Qian Weichang calls himself a versatile scientist. He relied on his position and more than twenty concurrent posts and Zhang, Luo to carry out a series of activities against socialism and against the leadership of the Party. In last year's national science plan, there was a group for the mechanization and automation of production processes, and Qian Weichang was the leader of the group. The group wanted to draft a description of sixteen central scientific questions. Qian Weichang volunteered to write the description of automation of petroleum and light industry, but he delayed submitting it, citing that he was busy. In the end, it was not written. In fact, he was almost completely away from production at that time. In addition, the most important thing was that the comprehensive task book of the group should be written by the group leader. Qian Weichang drafted an initial draft of eight thousand words, but the group unanimously believed that the content was empty, impractical, and had many errors. As a result, it was completely rewritten, and the method of writing in sections and collective discussion was adopted. Qian Weichang did not participate in the writing. However, when it was printed, the writer became Qian Weichang. Qian Weichang is interested in the number planning and cadre planning of automation majors in national universities. These are not his specialties. In connection with the anti-socialist program on "science planning" put forward by the China Democratic League, Qian Weichang is the mastermind. It seems that he intentionally engaged in personnel arrangement activities.

When the group discussed the establishment of the preparatory committee for the Automation Research Institute, the unanimous opinion was that Qian Xuesen should preside over it. Later, it was considered that it could not be specifically proposed. However, in the emergency task description he wrote, Qian Weichang privately wrote his own name on it as the director of the committee. What is the purpose of this trick of stealing the sky and changing the day?

Professor Du Qinghua said: "Qian Weichang's academic prestige far exceeds his own scientific level. He obtained this prestige by deceiving the Party's trust. He especially likes others to regard him as a great expert. He likes to fill the expert in all aspects of science. He pretends to understand when he doesn't and has a tendency to flaunt and show off in science." Professor Wang Jiading said, "I have contacted some classmates and alumni of Qian Weichang in other work units. They all felt that Qian Weichang's social status was rising day by day and was not commensurate with his talent. His old classmates said, "Qian Weichang climbed too high. He is not worth it." He boasted himself as a versatile scientist."

What is Qian Weichang's attitude towards science? Some materials have been revealed in the Tsinghua University Journal. Last year, Qian Weichang presumptuously wrote a plan on agricultural machinery in the capacity of an agricultural machinery expert. However, he did not have enough knowledge in this area and did not bother to consult agricultural machinery experts. The draft he wrote hastily was completely unqualified. Therefore, it had no reference value at all in the formal planning. Later, it had to be re-ordered by more than a dozen experts. Four years ago, Qian Weichang published "Scientific Inventions in Chinese History." He looked like a scholar studying the history of science. However, there were many errors in the book. The whole book is only about 100 pages. There are more than 20 errors in only a part of the content involving two articles. Some plagiarized other people's works. According to others, many parts of his book were copied from Mr. Liu Xianzhu's "Historical Materials of Chinese Mechanical Engineering," Mr. Liang Sicheng's "Our Great Architectural Tradition and Heritage," Mr. Li Yan's "History of Chinese Mathematics," and Mr. Zhu Kezhen's "China's Great Contributions to Astronomy in Ancient Times."

A Two-Faced Ambitious Man

Many professors pointed out that Qian Weichang exhausted the two-faced methods to protect himself. Today, his words, deeds, and methods have been revealed, and the original form of the rightists has been exposed.

Li Jixiang, an old professor at Tsinghua University, said when criticizing Qian Weichang, "I think Qian Weichang is very ambitious. He has developed to a point of arrogance today, and even uses unscrupulous means, using two-faced methods to deceive and deceive. Does Qian Weichang think that he was progressive in the past? I remember that when Beijing was about to be liberated, he told me that he wanted to go to the United States to study rockets. At that time, I persuaded him not to go, but he did not go later, not because he had thought it through ideologically, but because some requirements were not approved. After liberation, at a group meeting, he proposed to rely on middle-aged and young teachers to drive the old teachers off the stage. The Party members firmly opposed it. He said unhappily, "I know your Communist Party's tricks. You use me when you need me, and you shoot me when you don't need me." Later, at the beginning of the department adjustment, he was unwilling to dismantle Tsinghua University. At that time, he told the teachers that the Ministry of Education agreed with his views. He also told the Ministry of Education that the teachers agreed with his views. Therefore, it also brought some losses to the department adjustment work. Qian Weichang was very active on the surface from 1952 to 1956, but in fact he was playing two-faced tricks. What Qian Weichang grabbed was the Party's basic policy on higher education. On the other hand, he also seized the ideological education of young people. He divided and incited young people, saying that young people were suffering, and so on. And he did everything he could on the relations between the Party and the masses, provoking new and old teachers, and provoking the relationship between students and teachers. He even said to me that the Party does not trust me. He used such methods to provoke the relations between the Party and the masses, which also divided the young students."

Associate Professor Wang Zunhua also said that Qian Weichang used all the words and methods in the rightist dictionary in the past few self-criticisms to escape and retreat in order to resist criticism. It is clear that he himself is a rightist and is attacking the Party under a big banner, but he said that he also wants to draw a clear line with the rightists, saying that he was influenced by the rightists. It is clear that he was complacent before and after June 6th and was actively acting, but he said that he was very frightened and afraid. It is clear that he took the initiative to instigate at the free forum and ignited fires everywhere, but he said that he was forced to give a speech. He concealed himself and reduced his problems to two small burdens, saying that he overemphasized knowledge and business, and that he was a liberal! In fact, he is a personal ambitious man, a vanguard of the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji group attacking universities and the scientific community.

Wu Han, the director of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting that Qian Weichang intentionally created a tense atmosphere at the meeting on June 6th and among the students. This is a political blackmail against the Party, and the nature of the problem is serious.

At the three-day meeting, because Qian Weichang did not make a good account of the meeting on June 6th and other rightist activities, it aroused the anger of many teachers. The teachers said that they must fight to the end with the rightist Qian Weichang and completely expose the faces of these monsters, ghosts, snakes, and gods. They will never stop until they win!

    从得意忘形到原形毕露
    右派分子钱伟长的阴谋破产了
    本报记者陈柏生报道　连日来，清华大学师生正向资产阶级右派分子钱伟长展开批判。在许多会议上，师生们指出，钱伟长在科学家的招牌掩护下来向党和人民进攻。他在校外与右派分子章伯钧等保持亲密的联系，在校内师生员工中间进行挑拨煽惑，想走资产阶级教育的道路，推翻共产党的领导，为资产阶级打天下。
    钱伟长自整风开始以来，即在学校中利用自由论坛发表煽动性的言论，争取群众，分化同学，打击党的威信。他迷惑了一部分青年，但是也有些青年对他的右派言论提出质问和怀疑，在学生中展开争辩。一直到6月6日会议被揭露出来以后，他的画皮才被揭掉。人们才看清楚他是有政治企图、有组织活动、用挑拨煽动等办法来向党和人民进攻的右派分子。
    到处点火
    “到处点火可以煽动工农，学生的大字报便于接管学校，大鸣大放，一触即发，天下顷刻大乱，共产党马上完蛋。”这是6月6日右派分子章伯钧向北京六教授所作目前形势的估计。就是在这样的一个右派分子的集会上，作为北京六教授之一的钱伟长，不仅参加了这次集会，而且他在会上的发言是最得章伯钧赏识的。
    就在参加6月6日的六教授会议当天下午，动力系的俞国宁、吴文权等几个学生访问了钱伟长。钱伟长认为机会来了，就开始点火了。他说，现在群众的情绪是烦闷的，有话讲不出，要想发泄，但找不到题目。你们今天也是来找题目的。你们要知道，大家轰轰烈烈搞，也有人在外面哭哭啼啼，没有人关怀。
    钱伟长说，同学本身就存在宗派情绪，硬把人分成进步、中间和落后，依我看，进步的人也不过学会说几句漂亮话。钱伟长说到这里兴奋起来，他说，青年人太不豪放了，束缚太多，我年纪比你们大得多，我不怕束缚。人家给我戴帽子，我就不戴，把它扔了。
    钱伟长在这个时候，还向物理系的二十多个学生点了火。有的学生说，科学馆前已经有人签名主张理工合校了。钱伟长问有多少人？有人回答说有六百多人。他说，这太少，至少要搞六千人的签名还差不多，声势浩大，让高教部看看。学生临走时，他又说，你们去签名吧！
    钱伟长还对李恒德副教授说，同学的情况很不好，很严重，到处找题目。你要不要同学生讲讲话？我可以教他们来找你。李恒德责问钱伟长道，你这是什么意思？
    钱伟长对6月6日的会议内容是保持绝对秘密的。他在6月19日清华学生自由论坛上作讲演时，同学们曾问他6月初找章伯钧去作什么时，他却对学生说是找章伯钧谈科学规划的事。到了6月20日和6月24日民盟北京市委扩大会议上，参加6月6日座谈的北京六教授之中的陶大镛和费孝通，却相继揭露了一些这个座谈会的内幕，又揭露了钱伟长在那天会议上曾说学生运动的特点是要找个头，若与教师联合，就要出乱子，等等。这样一来，钱伟长的绝对秘密就保守不住了。
      推、混、赖
    当钱伟长对动力系学生的谈话受到广大学生的批评时，学校内反对右派分子斗争的声势也越来越大了。钱伟长怎么办呢？只有退却了。他再三说谈话记录不确切，不真实，本人概不负责！俞国宁同学责问他道，我们访问他说的话，现在都否认了。这使我们很惊讶。我们访问了许多教授，发表出来的谈话，他们都认为是符合事实的，为什么钱伟长的话却记错了呢？
    钱伟长看到反章伯钧、罗隆基右派分子的斗争深入展开了，于是也就装了个好人。6月19日他在学生论坛斥责章伯钧是政治野心家，说做梦也没有想到与章伯钧、储安平有联系，他装得很像。可是，在20日民盟北京市委的扩大会议上，陶大镛揭露了六教授会议上他的言行。他的谜底被拆穿了。且看他怎么说呢？他对洪风标等二十个同学说，章伯钧讲些什么话，没有听清楚，因为中途他小便过几次。
    7月2日、3日，钱伟长在到会师生的一致批判和质问下，他只是稍稍交代了一下他在校内和孟昭英教授、常迵教授、何成钧副教授的一些关系。接着他又谈了一下曾昭抡怎么鼓动他去摸文教规划的底，以及他怎么经费孝通的介绍认识了储安平。他说，储在5月22日给他写了信，5月26日又亲来清华大学找他。储和他谈要在人大开会时谈肃反问题，而且要向毛主席提意见。储说自己就要揽光明日报了，又说他和光明日报党组斗争，他要把北京大学民主墙大字报的消息登出来等情况，最后还看了清华的大字报才走。钱伟长还谈到他和费孝通的关系说，我之所以掉到章、罗圈子里，主要费孝通要负责，并谈到费孝通通过“串联”方式，来在全国搞反映知识分子的要求的活动等。
    在这些会议上，钱伟长的检讨还没有触及根本问题，引起了大家的愤怒。
      挑拨党群关系
    许多人在会议上指出：挑拨煽动党群关系，党和高级知识分子的关系，党和青年的关系，这是钱伟长的重要手法。钱伟长曾说，不是党员就没有前途，他有职无权，企图来借此造成党和群众的对立。
    钱伟长在解放前还只是清华大学一个普通教授，参加评议会也没有竞选上。现在他已经做到清华大学的副校长、科学院的学部委员、全国人民代表大会代表。他一身兼二十多职，但他还说党不重视他不信任他。他在清华的权很大，但还说他有职无权。吴晗曾就此事在会上质问钱伟长道，今天的地位是谁给你的？是人民给你的！你对党和人民抱着什么样的看法？什么样的态度呢？梁思成教授也在批判钱伟长的大会上激动地说，钱伟长你说“不是党员就没有前途”，可是你不是党员，你没有前途吗！你身兼二十多职，又是副校长，又是科学院学部委员！如果你认为还没有前途，那末你的前途是什么呢？是和章伯钧、罗隆基一样的前途吗？梁思成教授还说，钱伟长用的办法是搞个清华的大选举，搞个大签名，想由他来独揽清华的大权。
    徐亦庄副教授也揭露钱伟长说，我曾亲耳听到钱伟长说只有党员才有前途这样的话。钱伟长认为清华中最主要的问题，无论是学生与教师，都是前途问题，不是党员就没有前途。因为这样，有一个女学生曾到钱伟长那里哭过好几次，觉得自己没有前途。徐亦庄质问钱伟长为什么要歪曲事实说“只有党员才有前途”？他说，钱伟长曾希望全校起来“抗议”所谓前途问题，这样做就是想要把整个党委会的领导搞垮。
    想走资产阶级教育的道路
    在教育方面，钱伟长是反对走社会主义道路的，他想走资本主义教育的道路。
    钱伟长在5月31日的学生自由论坛上说，老清华并不完全是照抄英美的一套，而是结合了中国的实际的。张维教授质问道，老清华无计划、无培养目标，歌颂自发性的教育制度，不是从美英资本主义国家抄来的吗？难道是社会主义的吗？李辑祥说，波匈事件发生以后，钱伟长就变到右派阵营里去了。他在光明日报上发表的关于培养目标的谈话，根本方面就是否认学习苏联，否认教学改革，提出另一种培养目标。夏镇英说，钱伟长想把清华拖上资本主义道路。大家不要孤立地看作清华的问题，要看作是章伯钧所领导的向文教界进攻的组成部分，而钱伟长就是急先锋。
    金希武教授说，大家都知道，钱伟长在1月7日向光明日报发表了震动全国的有关高等工业学校培养目标的谈话。在这篇谈话里，他抱着一种挑衅的态度。他对教学改革的成就一字未提，相反地从实质上否定了教学改革和向苏联学习的社会主义教育路线。他力求否定按照一定培养目标的专业教育，而把新中国的高等教育拖回到解放前的资本主义的通才教育的老路上去。钱伟长发表这种与党的教育政策违背的谈话，是拥护党和愿意走社会主义道路的表示吗？
    剥下万能科学家外衣
    钱伟长在对待科学研究的态度上，也是不老实的，不懂装懂，却向人吹嘘自己是“万能科学家”。
    在7月3日的会议上，现在清华大学工作的东北工学院的郎世俊教授说：我要揭开他伪科学家的外衣。钱伟长自称为一个万能的科学家。他凭借自己的地位和二十几个兼职和章、罗在一起进行了一系列反对社会主义、反对党的领导的活动。去年的全国科学规划工作中，有一个生产过程机械化，自动化小组，钱伟长是组长。小组要拟出十六个中心科学问题的说明书。钱伟长自愿承担写石油及轻工业自动化的说明书，但他借口忙，迟迟不交。最后没有写出来，实际上他当时几乎是全脱产的。另外还有一最重要的事，小组综合任务书应由小组长执笔。钱伟长拟出一个八千字的初稿，但小组一致认为内容空洞，不切实，并且有很多错误。结果全盘重写，采取分段执笔集体讨论的办法做出来，钱伟长未参加执笔。而当印出来时，执笔人却变为钱伟长。钱伟长有兴趣的是全国高等学校自动化专业人数规划、干部规划。这些都不是他的特长。联系民盟提出的，关于“科学规划”的反社会主义的纲领，钱伟长是主谋，看来是有意搞人事安排活动。
    小组讨论到成立自动化研究所筹备委员会时，一致意见是由钱学森来主持，后来认为可以不具体提出。但最后在他写的紧急任务说明书上钱伟长却私自把自己名字写上去当主任委员。这种偷天换日的勾当企图何在？
    杜庆华教授说：钱伟长的学术威望是远远超过了自己科学水平。他是骗取了党的信任而取得这些威望的。他特别喜欢别人把他看成大专家，喜欢在科学的各方面都充内行，不懂装懂，在科学上有招摇卖弄的倾向。汪家鼎教授说：我在其他工作单位接触过钱伟长的一些同班和校友，对钱伟长社会地位一天天高升，都觉得同他的才能不相称。他的老同学说“钱伟长爬得太高，他不值得。”他把自己吹成一个万能科学家。
    钱伟长对待科学的态度是怎么样的呢？清华校刊上揭露了一些材料。钱伟长在去年曾自以为是地以农业机械专家的身份写了关于农业机械的规划。但是，他在这方面并不具有足够的知识，又不屑请教农业机械的专家，草草写出的草案，完全不合乎要求，因之在正式规划时根本没有任何参考价值。后来，不得不另由十几位专家重订。四年前，钱伟长出版了“我国历史上的科学发明”。他俨然是一位研究科学史的学者了。可是全书错误甚多，全书不过一百页左右，仅在两篇文章涉及的一部分内容中即有二十多项错误。有的抄袭他人著作，据别人揭发说他这本书的许多部分是从刘仙洲先生的“中国机械工程史料”、梁思成先生“我国伟大的建筑传统与遗产”、李俨先生的“中国数学史”、竺可桢先生“中国古代在天文学上伟大的贡献”等文中抄来的。
    两面派的野心家
    许多教授都指出钱伟长用尽了两面派手法想来掩护自己。今天他的这些言行和手法，已被揭露，右派分子的原形已露出来了。
    清华大学的老教授李辑祥在批判钱伟长时说，我认为钱伟长是很有野心的，他今天已发展到一种狂妄的地步，甚至不择手段，用两面派手法，蒙混欺骗。钱伟长认为自己过去进步，是这样吗？记得就在北京快要解放的时候，他还对我说要到美国去研究火箭，那时我劝他不要去，但是他后来没有去成并不是思想上搞通了，而是有些要求没有批准。解放后，他在一个小组会上提出要依靠中年青年的教师，把老教师赶下台去，党员坚决反对，他很不高兴地说，我知道你们共产党的一套，用得着你时就用，用不着  时就枪毙。以后在院系调整刚开始时，他不愿拆散清华大学，当时就对教师说教育部同意他的看法，他又对教育部说教师同意他的看法，因此给院系调整工作也多少带来了损失。钱伟长在1952年到1956年期间，表面上很积极，但是实际上他是在耍两面派手腕。钱伟长抓的是党在高等教育方面的基本方针政策，另一方面他还抓住青年思想教育工作。他分化和煽动青年，说青年苦闷，等等。而他对党群关系上更是五花八门，挑拨新老教师，挑拨同学和教师之间的关系，他甚至也对我说过，党不信任我。他用这样的手法挑拨党群关系，使青年学生中也受到分化。
    王遵华副教授也说，钱伟长在过去几次的检讨中用尽了右派字典中的词汇和手法来逃避和退却，以期抵抗批判。分明他自己是右派，并且打着大旗向党进攻，他却说他也要与右派划清界限，说自己是受了右派影响。分明他在6月6日前后得意忘形，在积极行动，但他却说很恐惧、害怕。分明他自己在自由论坛上主动地大事煽动，处处点火，他却说是被迫拉去讲演。他掩饰着自己，把自己的问题缩成两个小包袱，说什么自己过于重视知识业务呀，自己是自由主义呀！其实他是一个个人野心家，是章伯钧、罗隆基集团中向高等学校和科学界进攻的急先锋。
    民盟北京市委主任委员吴晗在会上说，钱伟长在6月6日会议上和学生中间，有意制造紧张气氛，这是政治上的向党的敲诈勒索，问题的性质是严重的。
    在接连三天的会上，因为钱伟长对6月6日的会议和其他右派活动没有进行很好的交代，引起许多教师的愤怒。教师们表示一定要和右派分子钱伟长战斗到底，把这些魑魅魍魉、牛鬼蛇神的面貌彻底暴露出来，不获胜利，决不收兵！
