Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th - Zhao Wengang, a deputy manager of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company who came from a Red Army background, is deeply praised by many people for his spirit of diligently studying technology and business.

	Yuan Shuli, an engineer at the company's design office, told Xinhua reporters, "When he first came to our company, he didn't understand any technology. Back then, he had to listen to us. But he studied very hard, was good at learning from workers and engineering technicians, and now we have to listen to him on many major technical issues."

	Tan Shaoyi, an engineer at the capital construction department, said, "I have spent the longest time with Manager Zhao in the capital construction department, and his spirit of studying technology is indeed worthy of our admiration. For example, in 1952, when building a large steelmaking workshop, many cracks appeared in the poured concrete. Manager Zhao was determined to solve this problem himself. At that time, he didn't understand any technology, but he searched through books and collected information, and experimented with workers on site. After a period of time, he finally solved the problem and proposed a new construction method. This incident surprised us all."

	Tan Shaoyi said, "In recent years, our company has had a heavy capital construction task, and he personally directed almost every major project. Our engineering and technical personnel often couldn't make up our minds on some key issues, and our consideration of issues lacked a comprehensive perspective. For example, last year, after the major overhaul of the No. 2 blast furnace was completed, it should have been handed over to production, but the production department refused to accept it, wanting us to guarantee that there were no technical problems. I didn't dare to make the decision at the time. Manager Zhao said that we should take care of the needs of the country. If problems occur after production starts, can't we solve them then? He said, don't be afraid of making mistakes, it's okay to learn lessons from mistakes. These qualities are not something that can be solved by technology alone. Our engineering and technical personnel still need to undergo long-term training."

	Zhao Wengang worked for landlords from the age of eleven and joined the Red Army troops in the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet Area at the age of fourteen. He had never attended school for a single day since he was a child. After the advance into the Southwest in 1950, the higher authorities sent him to serve as the deputy director of the original 101 Steel Plant (the predecessor of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company), and later he was responsible for leading the work of the design office and capital construction department. He has been twice named a model worker in Chongqing. When reporters asked him about his experience in leading technical work in recent years, he said, "Yes, technical issues are very difficult, and it was a bit difficult at first, but if you are determined to delve into them, you won't find them difficult and boring!"

### 从红军战士变为钢铁战士  工程技术人员赞扬赵文刚

    从红军战士变为钢铁战士
    工程技术人员赞扬赵文刚
    新华社重庆30日电　老红军出身的干部、重庆钢铁公司副经理赵文刚刻苦钻研技术业务的精神深得许多人的赞扬。
    这个公司设计处工程师袁树励对新华社记者说：“他初来我们公司的时候，什么技术也不懂，那时候他要听我们说。但是他很刻苦钻研、善于向工人和工程技术人员学习，现在在很多重大技术问题上我们还要听他的了。”
    基本建设处工程师谭绍仪说：“我在基本建设处和赵经理相处的时间最久，他钻研技术的精神确实很值得我们佩服。比如1952年在建设大型炼钢车间的时候，浇灌的混凝土发生了很多裂缝。赵经理决心亲自来解决这个问题。那时候他什么技术也不懂，但是他到处翻书本，搜集资料，在现场和工人作试验。经过一段时间，他终究把这个问题解决了，并且提出一套新的施工方法。这件事使我们都感到惊讶。”
    谭绍仪说：“这几年来，我们公司的基本建设任务很重，差不多每次重大工程施工都是他亲自指挥。我们工程技术人员往往在一些关键问题上拿不定主意，考虑问题缺乏全面观点。比如去年二号高炉大修完了应该移交生产，但是生产部门不肯接收，要我们保证技术上毫无问题，我当时就不敢作主。赵经理说，要照顾国家需要，投入生产后如果发生了问题再来解决不行吗？他说，不要怕出错，出了错能接受教训就行。像这些修养决不是单凭技术就能解决问题的，我们工程技术人员还要经过长期锻炼才行。”
    赵文刚十一岁就给地主家扛活，十四岁参加川陕甘苏区红军部队。他从小没有进过一天学校。1950年进军西南以后，上级派他担任原一○一钢铁厂付厂长（即重庆钢铁公司前身），以后负责领导设计处和基本建设处的工作。他曾经两次被评选为重庆市劳动模范。当记者问到他这几年来领导技术工作的体会时，他说：“是的，技术问题很生硬，最初摸是有些困难，但是下决心钻进去就不会觉得生硬枯燥了！”
