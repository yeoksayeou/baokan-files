Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th - Many townships and agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province have made various preparations to welcome the middle and primary school graduates who are about to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.

    Yongjin Township in Jiaxiang County, Tanzhuang Township in Shen County, Shao Township in Rizhao County, Quanlin Township in Sishui County, and others have formed graduate work committees under the leadership of the local Communist Party organizations to be specifically responsible for arranging the work of graduates. Many townships and cooperatives also attach great importance to social publicity. In Rizhao County's Shao Township, with the help of township and cooperative cadres, parents of students have proactively made plans for their children to participate in production or self-study after failing to continue their education. Many townships and cooperatives plan to hold welcome meetings for the students when they return to the cooperative, down to each production team. Some township Communist Youth League organizations are even planning to hold get-togethers for the students when they return home to welcome this new force.

    Not long ago, the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County signed a contract with sixty graduating middle and primary school students from the cooperative, guaranteeing them work in the cooperative if they failed to advance in their studies. The Party and League organizations of the cooperative also convened meetings of cooperative members and parents to criticize the negative phenomena of sarcasm and attacks on young students participating in agricultural production. In Shengzhuang Township, Tai'an County, six agricultural cooperatives have a total of one hundred and ninety-one graduating middle and primary school students. These cooperatives plan to assign them to work as technicians, accountants, civil teachers, and feeders, and the cooperatives have also designated cooperative members with production knowledge and skills to help them learn agricultural techniques.

    Many agricultural cooperatives have also made meticulous arrangements for the learning, recreational activities, and living aspects of the graduating middle and primary school students after they return to their hometowns to participate in production. The Jianggezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Muping County plans to place some junior high school graduates as teachers in their villages, and organize primary school graduates to study in addition to participating in production; those who like recreational activities can participate in the cooperative's amateur theater troupe. The Communist Youth League members and Young Pioneers among the graduates will be immediately incorporated into the League and team organizations upon their return. The Qunli Agricultural Cooperative in Baiding Township, Sishui County, has vacated a house as a study place for self-study groups of those returning to participate in production and learning. The Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Liangshan County has reorganized the cooperative's library, purchased new books, and prepared spiritual food for the graduates.

    为毕业生安排生产和学习
    山东省许多乡、社正在积极筹划
    新华社济南4日电　山东省有许多乡和农业社已做好各项准备，欢迎即将回乡参加农业生产的中小学毕业生。
    嘉祥县勇进乡、莘县谭庄乡、日照县邵町乡、泗水县泉林乡等都在乡的中共党组织领导下，组成了毕业生工作委员会，专门负责安排毕业生工作。许多乡、社也很重视社会宣传工作。日照县邵町乡在乡、社干部的帮助下，学生家长都主动地对孩子升不上学后参加生产或自学的问题作了打算。许多乡、社直到各生产队都准备学生回社时即分别召开欢迎会，有的乡的共青团组织还准备学生回乡时举行联欢会，迎接这批新生力量。
    在不久以前，莒县爱国农业社同这个社的六十名中小学应届毕业生订了合同，如果他们升不上学保证他们回社有工作。社的党、团组织还召开了社员会、家长会，批判了对青年学生参加农业生产讽刺打击的不良现象。泰安县省庄乡六个农业社共有应届中、小学毕业生一百九十一人，这些社计划分别安排他们担任技术员、会计、民师、饲养员等工作，社里还确定了有生产知识和技术的社员帮助他们学习农业技术。
    许多农业社对中小学应届毕业生回乡生产后的学习、文娱活动、生活等方面也做了细致的安排。牟平县姜格庄农业社计划把一部分初中毕业生安置到本村当教师，对小学毕业生除参加生产外，还组织他们学习；爱好文娱活动的可参加社内的业余剧团。对毕业生中的共青团员和少先队员，待他们回乡后，马上编入团、队组织。泗水县百顶乡群力农业社已腾出一所房子，作为回乡参加生产学习的自学小组的学习场所。梁山县先锋农业社重新整理了社里的图书馆，另购一部分新书，为毕业生准备精神食粮。
