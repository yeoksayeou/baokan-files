    The Spark of the Guangzhou Commune
    ——Veteran Shi Zhan, Who Participated in the Guangzhou Uprising, Talks About the Event
    Zeng Minzhi
    I participated in the Guangzhou Uprising, and at that time I worked in the General Staff Department of the Revolutionary Military Commission. It has been almost thirty years since then.
    The comrades who commanded this uprising were Zhang Tailei, Ye Ting, Yang Yin, Yun Daiying, and others. In October 1927, I was assigned by Comrade Yang Yin to return to Guangzhou from Macau to prepare for the organization of workers' armed forces.
    The situation at that time was: After Chiang Kai-shek launched the "April 12th" counter-revolutionary coup, the revolutionary workers and peasants were brutally slaughtered. The warlords in Guangdong and Guangxi were divided and occupied territory, and warlord melee broke out. The people of Guangdong suffered from the ravages of war, banknotes depreciated, prices soared, the reactionaries intensified their persecution of workers, and there were more and more workers' strikes. The reactionary warlords drove the striking workers out of their dormitories, leaving them homeless. The reactionaries also arrested and slaughtered striking workers, arousing great anger among the broad masses of workers.
    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the situation at that time and believed that the time for an armed uprising was ripe. Therefore, under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Tailei, secret preparations were made. The Provincial Committee carried out preparations for the uprising's political program, military plan, Soviet organization, and mobilization of peasants from various places to support the uprising.
    The Revolutionary Military Commission was the general command organ of the uprising. The Xiguayuan (watermelon garden) on Fengning Road in Guangzhou was the command post for planning the uprising. The Workers' Red Guards were organized, and the participants included rickshaw pullers, seamen, and transportation workers.
    In early December, the Soviet Congress was convened under extremely secret circumstances, and nineteen members of the Soviet government were elected to form a committee. The uprising was originally scheduled for December 13th. The Revolutionary Military Commission had already notified the Red Guards at 4:00 PM on the 10th to prepare and listen for the long whistle as a signal.
    During these tense days, a rice shop on Zhonghua North Road that stored military supplies was discovered and seized by the enemy, the rice shop owner betrayed us, and the uprising plan was also leaked. In order to prevent the reactionary army from being transferred back from Shaoguan, the military uprising was launched two days earlier. The Red Guards were divided into several detachments, scattered in the eastern and western districts of Guangzhou and the Taiqiu Academy in Longzang Street.
    Xiguayuan was the place where the uprising was sworn in. On the 11th, Comrade Zhang Tailei announced the uprising's political program at a mass meeting and declared the establishment of the Soviet government. He waved his hand, and his loud voice inspired everyone present. The cheers of thousands of people resounded through the sky. Military action began.
    Gunfire and artillery fire rang out at the railway station, the puppet Public Security Bureau, and various places in Xiguan. When the uprising army attacked the puppet Public Security Bureau, the imprisoned political prisoners also rioted in the prison cells as an internal response. In a very short period of time, the puppet Public Security Bureau was occupied. The command headquarters was moved to the puppet Public Security Bureau. At that time, after the uprising troops occupied the puppet Public Security Bureau, Comrade Zhou Wenyong wrote the banner "General Headquarters of the Guangzhou Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army" and hung it on the gate.
    I remember very clearly that the uprising army did not eat during the battle, and the workers distributed bread and tea to them separately to satisfy their hunger.
    On the 12th, the fighting in the Yuexiu Mountain area was fierce. At this moment, Comrade Zhang Tailei was taking a car from Xiguayuan to the Public Security Bureau headquarters when he was unfortunately hit by enemy stray bullets in front of the Central Park and died!
    The loss of leadership figures in the battle, and the news spread, and the people's grief can be imagined. I saw Comrade Ye Ting at the headquarters. He was very sad, but he still directed the battle with tears in his eyes in front of the military map.
    I contacted various places and saw with my own eyes that red cloth slogans were hung all over Weixin Road, Huiai Road and the area in front of the park, and the political program and declaration of the Soviet government were posted everywhere. Women and students enthusiastically launched propaganda. The streets were full of prisoners and war trophies, which made people feel very happy.
    The heroic fighting of the uprising army failed to capture many enemy strongholds. The enemy's Fourth Army Headquarters on Wende Road, the Taiping Sha Armory, the Twenty-sixth Division Headquarters of the enemy in Zhaoqing Guild Hall, the camp headquarters of the enemy's newly formed regiment in Chen Clan Academy... were all in contention.
    At that time, imperialist warships were moored at Bai'etan in the Pearl River. We were very vigilant about the movements of imperialism. I remember that on the evening of the 12th, I went to Liuer Road to contact and scout, and saw a worker holding a weapon and guarding the Pearl River. I gently asked him:
    "Brother, is there any movement?"
    The worker's answer was full of hatred:
    "As long as those robbers dare to do anything, I will definitely fight them to the death!"
    Not long after, British, American, and Japanese imperialists really interfered in our armed uprising. Their warships patrolled and threatened the Pearl River, and shelled to cover the bandit army of Li Fulin, which was entrenched in Henan, Guangzhou, to attack us, and landed at Huangsha, Shigong Ancestral Hall, and other places. The United States and the British Marine Corps also landed on the Bund. The reactionary warlord Xue Yue's troops were also transferred back to Guangzhou to counterattack the Yuexiu Mountain and Zhongshan Park line. At noon on the 13th, the battle was fierce, and the situation of the uprising army was unfavorable. Due to the premature uprising, the counties did not have time to cooperate, and the peasant self-defense army did not have time to go to Guangzhou to support. Seeing that they were isolated, the headquarters ordered to start retreating in order to preserve strength. The teaching regiment and the Workers' Red Guards withdrew to Huaxian County. I also disguised myself and hid in a friend's house among the citizens before leaving Guangzhou.
    Guangzhou was shrouded in terror. The reactionaries colluded with imperialism to defeat the Guangzhou Uprising and launched a bloody massacre. Many uprising soldiers sacrificed in the battle on the 13th, and six or seven thousand people were massacred. Taiping South Road, in front of the Finance Hall, Weixin Road, in front of the park... were full of corpses, and those who sacrificed mostly wore red ribbons. The reactionaries' madness had reached such an extent: anyone with red things on their body was arrested and killed!
    The Guangzhou Armed Uprising failed, but this uprising was the "retreat battle" after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927. It once established the second workers' regime after the Paris Commune and shocked the world. The military strength preserved after the Guangzhou Uprising has been integrated into the heroic and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army in the historical process of the past thirty years!

    广州公社的火花
    ——参加广州起义的老战士施展谈片
    曾敏之
    我是参加广州起义的，那时在革命军事委员会的参谋团工作。时间距今已快三十年了。
    指挥这次起义的是张太雷、叶挺、杨殷、恽代英等同志。1927年10月间，我受杨殷同志的指派，由澳门回到广州，准备组织工人武装。
    当时的形势是：蒋介石发动“四·一二”反革命政变之后，革命的工农群众惨遭屠杀。两广军阀割据，又爆发了军阀的混战。广东人民遭受战争的蹂躏，钞票贬值，物价高涨，反动派对工人的迫害越来越加紧，工人罢工的事件越来越多，反动军阀将罢工的工人赶出宿舍，让他们露宿街头。反动派还逮捕、屠杀罢工的工人，引起广大工人群众极大的愤怒。
    中共广东省委研究了当时的形势，认为武装起义的时机成熟了，于是在张太雷同志领导下，秘密准备，省委进行了关于起义政纲、军事计划、苏维埃组织、动员各地农民支援起义等的准备工作。
    革命军事委员会是起义总指挥机关。广州丰宁路的西瓜园是策动起义的指挥部。工人赤卫队组织起来了，参加赤卫队的有手车工人、海员、运输工人。
    12月初旬，苏维埃代表大会在极秘密的情势下召开了，选出苏维埃政府委员十九人，组成委员会。起义时间原定12月13日。革命军事委员会在10日下午四时已通知赤卫队做好准备，听汽笛长鸣为号。
    正在这样紧张的日子里，中华北路收藏军火的一间米店，被敌人发觉破获了，米店的老板叛变了，起义计划也被泄露了。为了不让反动派军队从韶关调回，起义的军事暴动提前两天发动了。赤卫队分成几个联队，散布在广州的东区、西区和龙藏街的太丘书院。
    西瓜园是起义誓师之地。11日，张太雷同志在群众大会上宣布了起义政纲，宣布苏维埃政府成立，他挥舞着手，宏亮的声音激励了每一个到会的人，千万人的欢呼声响彻云霄。军事行动开始了。
    火车站、伪公安局、西关各地都响起了枪炮声。当起义军进攻伪公安局时，被囚禁的政治犯也在监室中暴动起来作内应。在很短时间内就占领了伪公安局。指挥总部就迁到伪公安局。当时起义部队占领了伪公安局之后，由周文雍同志写了“广州市苏维埃工农红军总司令部”的横额悬挂在大门上。
    我记得很清楚，在战斗中，起义军都没有吃饭，由工人分头送面包茶水给他们充饥。
    12日越秀山一带战斗激烈。正在这时，张太雷同志由西瓜园乘车到公安局指挥部去，在中央公园前，不幸中了敌人的流弹，因而殉难了！
    在战斗中丧失了领导人物，噩耗传开，群众的悲愤情绪是可以想像的。我在指挥部看见叶挺同志，他悲痛得很，可是他在军用地图面前，仍然挥泪指挥战斗。
    我到各处联络，亲眼看到维新路、惠爱路公园前一带挂满了红布标语，到处贴着苏维埃政府的政纲、宣言。妇女、学生热烈地在展开宣传。马路两旁坐满了俘虏，摆满了战利品，真叫人心花怒放。
    起义军的英勇战斗，却未能攻克许多敌军据点，文德路的敌军第四军军部、太平沙军械库、肇庆会馆敌军二十六师师部、陈家祠敌军新编一团的营部……都在争夺中。
    那时在珠江的白鹅潭，停泊有帝国主义的军舰。我们非常警惕帝国主义的动静。记得12日晚间，我曾到六二三路联络侦察，看到一个工人手持武器向着珠江警戒，我轻轻问他：
    “弟兄，有动静吗？”
    那位工人回答时充满了仇恨的感情：
    “只要那些强盗敢动手，我就一定跟他拼命！”
    时隔不久，英国、美国、日本帝国主义果然干涉我们的武装起义了，他们的军舰在珠江上巡逻威胁，并发炮掩护盘据广州河南的李福林匪军向我们攻击，在黄沙、石公祠等处登陆。美国和英国的海军陆战队也在长堤登陆了。反动军阀薛岳的部队也调回广州向越秀山、中山公园一线反攻。13日中午，战况激烈，起义军形势不利。由于提前暴动，各县不及配合，农民自卫军赶不及到广州支援。眼看陷于孤立了。总部为了保存力量，下令开始撤退。教导团、工人赤卫队向花县撤走。我也化装混在市民中间隐蔽在一个朋友的家里，才离开广州。
    广州在恐怖笼罩中。反动派和帝国主义勾结打败了广州起义，展开了血腥的屠杀。13日在战斗中牺牲的起义战士很多，被屠杀的有六七千人，太平南路、财厅前、维新路、公园前……遍地尸骸，那些牺牲者多佩着红带。反动派的疯狂已到了这样程度：凡身上带有红色的东西的，都被捕被杀了！
    广州武装起义是失败了，可是这次起义是1927年大革命失败后的“退兵一战”，曾建立了继巴黎公社之后的第二个工人政权，震撼了世界。广州起义后所保存下来的军事力量，在三十年的历史进程中，已溶成英勇无敌的中国人民解放军的一部分了！
