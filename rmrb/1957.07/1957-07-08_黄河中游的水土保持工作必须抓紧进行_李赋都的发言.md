Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Must Be Carried Out Urgently
    Speech by Li Fudu
    Since liberation, great achievements have been made in soil and water conservation in the Yellow River - the lack of coordination between forestry, agriculture, water conservancy, and animal husbandry departments is a major shortcoming in the work - there are still many problems in the current organizational leadership, and it is hoped that the Central Soil and Water Conservation Commission will address them promptly.

    I fully agree with the work reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen.

    Today, I would like to talk about soil and water conservation in the soil erosion area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River. I hope that leaders at all levels will pay attention to this issue and resolutely do this work well!

    The vast loess area, including most parts of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, is constantly threatened by drought, and the people's lives are very impoverished. Since liberation, although people's lives have improved somewhat due to vigorous water conservancy construction and cultivation improvement, they are still poor and backward compared to other regions.

    The reason for the poverty of the people in the loess area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River is, on the one hand, due to insufficient and untimely rainfall, but the most important reason is that there are many heavy rains in summer and autumn, and soil erosion is extremely serious. A large amount of rainwater and fertile soil are not stored for the people to use, but are discharged into the river in vain. The people in this area know that the harvest of crops on slopes is very low, averaging only thirty to fifty jin per mu. In drought years, even the seeds cannot be recovered.

    The massive loss of soil and water not only causes poverty in the entire loess area, but also floods and sediment are discharged into the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The riverbed silts up, the dikes collapse, causing disasters for the Chinese people throughout history.

    After the liberation of the motherland, the people's government cared about the lives of the people in the Yellow River basin as soon as it was established. In the short period of five years, with the active work of relevant departments, the strong support of the people in the Yellow River basin, and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the comprehensive utilization plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's floods and developing water conservancy was completed. The great Sanmenxia Water Control Project started construction in April of this year. After the completion of this project, not only will it basically defend against the flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, but it will also generate a large amount of electricity, irrigate tens of millions of mu of farmland, and turn the Yellow River downstream channel into a modern shipping river through management projects. This project will bring endless happiness to the people in the Yellow River basin and bring very favorable conditions for the development of China's industry, agriculture, and transportation.

    As mentioned above, the amount of sediment brought down by the Yellow River from the soil erosion area in the middle reaches is very large. The discharge of these sediments will rapidly silt up the Sanmenxia Reservoir and gradually lose its function. Assuming that soil and water conservation work is not carried out in the soil erosion area, it is estimated that when the normal high water level of the reservoir is 360 meters and the storage capacity is 65 billion cubic meters, the reservoir will be filled with sediment after 60 years, and the normal operation period will only be more than 30 years.

    In order to improve the production of the loess area, improve the lives of the people, and extend the normal working life of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, we must do a good job in soil and water conservation in the soil erosion area upstream of the reservoir and resolutely fight against soil erosion.

    Since liberation, with the support of party and government leaders at all levels and the broad masses, soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has been greatly developed. On the basis of the victory of agricultural cooperation in our country, with the high tide of agricultural production, an unprecedented high tide was also set off in promoting soil and water conservation in 1956. Under the guiding principles and requirements of "centralized management, combining gully and slope management" and "greening barren mountains and slopes, terracing slopes, platforming gully land, and irrigating river land," as of 1956, soil and water conservation work in the Yellow River basin had completed the control of an area of 62,342 square kilometers. The main workload includes: afforestation of 10.8 million mu, planting grass on 7.97 million mu, field projects on 25.69 million mu, 230,000 drought wells, 820,000 gully dams and silt detention dams, and 2,319 gully earth dams.

    Dengjiabao, Wushan, Gansu: Due to the active and systematic development of soil and water conservation work while carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the five years since liberation, not only has soil erosion been basically stopped, but also water storage and irrigation have been used to make paddy fields on the mountains, and many mountains have been turned into terraces. In 1956, wheat achieved a high yield of 411 jin per mu. According to rough calculations, the average yield per mu was 80 jin before 1952; 117.5 jin in 1953; 134 jin in 1954; 221 jin in 1955; and 310 jin in 1956, which is about four times the average yield of 80 jin per mu at the time of liberation. The average income per person before 1952 was 382.5 jin; it increased to 466 jin in 1953; 529.8 jin in 1954; 739 jin in 1955; and 860 jin in 1956.

    Louwaigou, Zhongyang, Shanxi: Comprehensive centralized management was carried out from top to bottom, completing 1,283 mu of embankment construction, 33 mu of water platform terraces, one gully head protection project, digging 2,093 waterlogging ponds, digging 5 drought wells, planting trees on 122.5 mu of barren slopes and gully slopes, planting grass on 69 mu, digging fish scale pits and horizontal terraces for afforestation on 108.5 mu, pressing more than 2,000 wolfberry willows in low-lying areas, and building 111 gully dams and 14 dams, making 3,375 mu of area fully managed. The increase in production benefits through soil and water conservation was very significant in that year. Terraces can increase grain production by 14,087 jin, fish scale pits and horizontal terraces combined with afforestation and planting soybeans on 104 mu produced 4,285 jin, gully dam filling on 7 mu produced 297.5 jin, and land connection expanded cultivated land by 40 mu, producing 4,100 jin, totaling an increase of 22,669 jin of grain. 69 mu of pasture produced about 49,600 jin of green grass. According to the investment of 8,561 labor days, the average labor day can obtain 2.11 jin of grain and 3.13 jin of green grass in that year.

    Wujiapan, Suide, Shaanxi: In 1955, the average yield per mu maintained 64 jin in a dry year, while the average yield per mu in surrounding rural areas was only 27 jin, and it was basically not threatened by drought. The reason for its drought resistance and increased production lies in maintaining soil and water, appropriately increasing fertilizer application on the basis of better soil moisture, and implementing grass-crop rotation on limited land.

    Although we have achieved many achievements in soil and water conservation work, there are also many shortcomings and problems.

    We all know that soil and water conservation is a comprehensive utilization work that combines agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry. However, in the work, the agricultural, forestry, water, and animal husbandry aspects have not been well coordinated. At the same time, there are still very inconsistent opinions on the principles and measures that should be adopted for soil and water conservation. There is a situation of working independently and not cooperating with each other. The idea that each department emphasizes its own work measures is still very strong. For example, the work of the water conservancy department focuses on water conservancy measures and is not sufficiently combined with agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry aspects have different opinions on the role and economic value of engineering measures in soil and water conservation work. Due to inconsistent opinions and confusion in understanding, the healthy promotion of soil and water conservation work has been greatly affected. I believe that we must unify the understanding of the methods and measures that should be adopted by all parties to do a good job in soil and water conservation through experiments, practice, discussions, and research. Only on the basis of consistent views and mutual cooperation in work can we do the work well and strive to achieve the highest effect.

    The quality of some soil and water conservation work is very poor. For example, some silt detention dams, gully dams, and silt retention dams that have been repaired are washed away by a single flood.

    As of September last year, Gansu Province had built a total of 25 large dams, 314 medium dams, 7,096 small dams, and 49,566 gully dams. According to incomplete statistics from 18 counties in 7 special zones, 9 large dams, 77 medium dams, 388 small dams, and 179 gully dams were washed away. The erosion rate of earth dams was 7.4 percent, and the erosion rate of gully dams was 0.36 percent.

    Shaanxi completed a total of 50 large and medium-sized earth dams and 13,319 small earth dams last year, and 40,889 gully dams. According to statistics from the three main counties of Suide, Yanchang, and Zizhou, a total of 288 were washed away.

    As of the end of September last year, Shanxi had completed a total of 37,657 earth dams and 300,050 gully dams. In years of abnormal heavy rain, 7,121 earth dams were washed away, with a damage rate of 18.9 percent, and 15,897 gully dams were damaged, with a damage rate of 5.2 percent.

    The horizontal ditches built in some areas have too large a cross-section and occupy too much land, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. Many newly built terraces, contour ridges, and field edge ridges are not level. Not only do they not play the role of retaining water and storing sediment, but they also increase the destructive force and soil erosion due to concentrated runoff.

    The poor quality of soil and water conservation work is due, on the one hand, to the fact that we have not done enough experimental and scientific research work on various soil and water conservation measures, and we have not yet found practical design standards for various measures. Up to now, we still lack a comprehensive and localized soil and water conservation work specification or work design manual. Therefore, there is still blindness in some of our work. On the other hand, the masses have not mastered the technology. Some masses only know how to repair, but do not know how to repair, nor do they know whether the repaired project meets the specifications or not. In order to improve quality, we must strengthen the cultivation of soil and water conservation work talents and impart soil and water conservation work technology to farmers, so that farmers can also master the technology. Only under this condition can we improve quality and make soil and water conservation work play its due role.

    In our country, there are many areas with soil erosion, especially in the Yellow River basin, where soil erosion is very serious and the area is very wide. At the same time, soil and water conservation is not only a very complex mass work, but also a comprehensive technical work, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, soil, hydrology, and other aspects. Therefore, I think it is of great significance to increase courses related to soil and water conservation in relevant vocational schools in soil erosion areas, or to set up soil and water conservation classes, or even to establish soil and water conservation schools. Students who graduate from these schools can be assigned to counties and agricultural cooperatives as the backbone of technical guidance for soil and water conservation work and impart soil and water conservation technology to farmers.

    Strengthening experimental and scientific research work on soil and water conservation is also a very important issue. The experimental research institutions established by various departments in various regions must establish close ties, exchange experiences, and cooperate in division of labor.

    Since soil and water conservation work is of such great significance for the development of agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, and it also has a very important role for the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, there are still many problems in the organization and leadership of soil and water conservation. I think we have attached importance to this work in words, but we have not shown it in action. On the contrary, our work is slack. Since liberation, the area completed for soil and water conservation in the Yellow River basin is 67,892 square kilometers, of which 25,112 square kilometers were completed before the end of 1955, accounting for about 37 percent of the total workload. 1956 was the year when soil and water conservation work reached a climax, with a total of 37,230 square kilometers completed, accounting for 55 percent of the total workload. However, as of April 1957, in the main working season of soil and water conservation, the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Qinghai in the Yellow River basin only completed 22 percent of the planned number of 25,550 square kilometers, a total of 5,550 square kilometers. This year, many places have shown insufficient enthusiasm, and individual places have even shown a decline in morale. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the organizational structure is unsound. Some provinces have abolished the established Soil and Water Conservation Bureau due to streamlining the organization, changed it to a department-affiliated division, and merged the county Soil and Water Conservation Section into a section of the county Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau. The original soil and water conservation staff has also been transferred, losing the guiding role of professional institutions. In counties where the party and government are poorly managed, there is a free-flowing phenomenon. The development of soil and water conservation varies greatly from region to region. I think the relevant leading departments of the central government are responsible for the cause of this phenomenon. The National Soil and Water Conservation Commission was brewing for a long time, but it was established very late. The Ministry of Water Resources assigned the tasks of planning, technical guidance, etc. for soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, but the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is responsible but has no power for this work. I believe that in key soil and water conservation areas, a strong soil and water conservation organization should be established from the central government to the province, county, and even district and township. It is best to merge the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and water departments of the counties in the key areas to form a unified soil and water conservation organization. In addition to the existing departments, a soil and water conservation department should be established in key provinces, such as Shanxi, Gansu, and Shaanxi (Shaanxi has been established), so as to uniformly and specifically grasp the soil and water conservation work of each key county in the province. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission can serve as a central agency, and its main task is to guide the soil and water conservation work in its affiliated basin.

    I hope that the National Soil and Water Conservation Commission must organize the relevant departments to study how to strengthen the organizational structure related to soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, study how to collaborate and promote soil and water conservation work, and instruct the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to make good long-term plans and ten-year plans for soil and water conservation with the support and cooperation of the relevant agencies. The National Soil and Water Conservation Commission must strengthen the leadership of the soil and water conservation work of the provinces and relevant departments, and in the key areas, take soil and water conservation work as one of the main tasks of the cooperative, and draw appropriate labor forces to implement it seriously according to the plan.

    The above are only preliminary opinions. Please discuss and guide them. But it must be pointed out that soil and water conservation is a fundamental and important task for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River! Under the rule of the old regime and under the private system of individual farmers, this work was impossible to carry out. Only under the superior socialist system and under the system of agricultural cooperation is it possible to do this work well. This also shows that only under the socialist system is it possible to realize the great cause of fundamentally controlling the Yellow River. But it must be deeply realized that if we neglect this key soil and water conservation work in this way this year and do not correct it immediately, the service life of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project will inevitably be shortened as a result. I believe that as long as we attach importance to soil and water conservation work, actively study and promote this work, we have the confidence to achieve the goal of increasing production and controlling sediment!

    黄河中游的水土保持工作必须抓紧进行
    李赋都的发言
    解放以来，黄河水土保持工作成绩很大——林、农、水、牧各部门互不配合，是工作中的重大缺点——目前组织领导工作上的问题还很多，希望中央水土保持委员会抓紧解决。
    我完全同意周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长及彭真秘书长的各项工作报告。
    今天我愿意谈一谈黄河中游水土流失区的水土保持工作，希望各级领导重视这一问题，并坚决地把这一工作作好！
    广大黄土地区，包括甘、陕、晋大部地区经常地受着旱灾的威胁，人民生活很贫困。解放以来，由于大力兴修水利，改良耕作，人民生活虽然有所提高，但是同别的地区来比较还是贫困，落后。
    黄河中游黄土地区人民生活贫困的原因，一方面固然是由于雨水不充沛不适时，但最重要的还是由于夏秋两季暴雨特多，水土流失异常严重，大量的雨水和肥沃的土壤没有蓄存起来为人民所利用，白白地泄流到河里去。这个地区的人民都知道：在坡地上种庄稼收成是非常低微的，每亩地平均不过三十斤到五十斤，遇见旱年连种子都收不回来。
    大量水土的流失不但造成了整个黄土地区的贫困，而且洪水和泥沙泄到黄河下流，河床淤淀，堤防溃决，造成了有史以来中国人民的灾难。
    祖国解放后，人民政府刚成立就关怀着黄河流域人民的生活。在短短的五年中，经过有关部门的积极工作和黄河流域人民的大力支援以及苏联专家的无私援助，就完成了根治黄河水患、开发黄河水利的综合利用规划。伟大的三门峡水利枢纽工程已经于本年四月开了工。这个工程完成以后，不特基本上防御了黄河下游的洪水灾难，同时还发出大量电力，灌溉几千万亩农田，并通过治理工程使黄河下游河道成为一条现代化的航运河流。这个工程将给黄河流域的人民带来无穷的幸福，并给我国工业、农业建设和交通运输的发展带来了非常有利的条件。
    上面已经谈过，黄河从中游水土流失区带下来的泥沙是很多的。这些泥沙排泄下来将会使三门峡水库迅速地淤淀起来，而逐渐失去它的功用。假设在水土流失区不进行水土保持工作的话，估计在水库正常高水位为三百六十公尺、库容为六百五十亿立方公尺的情况下，水库到六十年以后，就会被泥沙填满，正常运用时期只有三十多年。
    为了提高黄土地区的生产，改善人民的生活，为了延长三门峡水利枢纽工程正常工作的年限，我们必须作好水库上游水土流失地区的水土保持工作，坚决地和水土流失作斗争。
    解放以来，黄河中游水土保持工作在各级党政领导及广大群众的支持下，得到了很大的发展。在我国农业合作化的胜利基础上，随着农业生产的高潮，一九五六年在推进水土保持工作上，也掀起了空前的高潮。在“集中治理，沟坡兼治”和
  “荒山荒坡绿化，坡地梯田化，沟地川台化，川地水利化”的方针和要求下，截至一九五六年黄河流域水土保持工作已经完成了控制面积六万二千三百四十二平方公里。主要工作量计：造林一千零八十万亩，种草七百九十七万亩，田间工程二千五百六十九万亩，旱井二十三万眼，谷坊、淤地坝八十二万座，沟壑土坝二千三百一十九座。
    甘肃武山邓家堡：由于解放后五年来在农业社会主义改造的同时，积极的、系统的开展了水土保持工作，目前不但基本上制止了水土流失，而且利用蓄水灌溉，使山上有了水田，许多山地变成了梯田。一九五六年小麦出现每亩四百一十一斤的高额丰产。每亩平均产量据粗算一九五二年以前是八十斤；一九五三年为一百一十七点五斤；一九五四年一百三十四斤；一九五五年二百二十一斤；一九五六年为三百一十斤，约为解放时平均亩产八十斤的四倍。一九五二年以前每人平均收入三百八十二点五斤；一九五三年增为四百六十六斤；一九五四年五百二十九点八斤；一九五五年七百三十九斤；一九五六年为八百六十斤。
    山西中阳楼外沟：从上而下地进行了全面集中治理，完成培地埂一千二百八十三亩，水平台阶地三十三亩，沟头防护一处，挖涝池二千零九十三个，打旱井五眼，利用荒坡沟坡种树一百二十二点五亩，种草六十九亩，挖鱼鳞坑水平地阶造林一百零八点五亩，低凹地压杞柳二千余株，筑谷坊一百一十一座，打坝十四座，使三千三百七十五亩面积达到全面治理。通过水土保持对当年增产效益很显著，梯田共可增产粮食一万四千零八十七斤，鱼鳞坑水平地阶结合造林种豆一百零四亩共产四千二百八十五斤，谷坊填地七亩共产二百九十七点五斤，土地连片扩大耕地四十亩，共产粮食四千一百斤，以上共计增产粮食二万二千六百六十九斤。六十九亩牧草约产青草四万九千六百斤，按投入的八千五百六十一个劳动日计算，平均每个劳动日当年可得粮食二斤十一两，并有青草三斤十三两。
    陕西绥德吴家畔：一九五五年在干旱年全年平均亩产保持着六十四斤，四周其他农村的产量平均每亩只有二十七斤，基本上没有遭受旱灾威胁。其抗旱增产的原因，就在于保持了水土，在地墒较好的基础上适当增施了肥料，并在有限土地上实施了草田轮作。
    在水土保持工作中，我们虽然获得了很多的成绩，但是缺点也是很多的，问题也是不少的。
    我们大家都知道，水土保持是农业、林业、水利、畜牧业综合利用互相结合的工作。但是在工作中农、林、水、牧各方面并没有很好地配合起来，同时对于水土保持所应采用的方针和措施意见还很不一致，在工作中存在着各自单干互不配合的情况，各部门强调本岗位工作措施的思想还很浓厚。例如水利部门的工作就着重于水利措施方面，而和农、林、牧结合不够。农、林、牧方面对于水土保持工作中的工程措施的作用和经济价值，则存有不同的意见。由于意见不统一，在工作中认识紊乱，就大大地影响了水土保持工作的健康推进。我认为我们必须通过实验、实践、讨论与研究把各方面对于作好水土保持应当采用的方法和措施在认识上统一起来。只有在看法一致，工作互相配合的基础上，我们才能把工作作好，争取达到最高的效果。
    有一部分水土保持工作的质量是很差的。如有些已经修好的淤地坝、谷坊、留淤坝经过一次洪水就被冲坏了。
    甘肃省截至去年九月止，共修大坝二十五座，中坝三百一十四座，小坝七千零九十六座，谷坊四万九千五百六十六道。据七个专区十八个县不完全统计，大坝冲毁九座，中坝七十七座，小坝三百八十八座，谷坊一百七十九座，土坝冲毁率为百分之七点四，谷坊冲毁率百分之零点三六。
    陕西去年共完成大中型土坝五十座，小土坝一万三千三百一十九座，谷坊四万零八百八十九座，据绥德、延长、子洲三个主要县的统计，共冲毁二百八十八座。
    山西截至去年九月底止，共完成土坝三万七千六百五十七座，谷坊三十万零五千座，在异常暴雨的年份，土坝冲毁七千一百二十一座，冲毁率为百分之十八点九，谷坊冲坏一万五千八百九十七座，冲毁率为百分之五点二。
    有的地区所修的水平沟断面太大，占地太多，群众很不满意。许多新修的梯田，等高沟埂、地边埂都不水平，不特没有起着拦水蓄泥的作用，反而由于径流集中，增加了破坏力和水土的流失。
    水土保持工作质量差，一方面是由于我们对于各项水土保持措施的实验与科学研究工作作的还不够，对于各项措施还没有求出切合实际的设计标准。我们到现在还缺乏一个全面的因地制宜的水土保持工作规范或者工作设计手册，因此，在我们的有些工作中还存在着盲目性。在另一方面，是由于群众没有把技术掌握起来。有些群众只知道修，而不知道应当怎么修，也不知道所修的工程合乎规格或者不合乎规格。为了提高质量我们必须加强水土保持工作人才的培育工作，把水土保持工作技术传授给农民，使农民也掌握技术。只有在这个条件下我们才能够提高质量，使水土保持工作获得应起的作用。
    在我们国家里水土流失的地区是很多的，尤其是在黄河流域水土流失很严重，面也很广，同时水土保持不特是一项很复杂的群众性工作，而且，还是一项综合性的技术工作，包括着农业、林业、牧业、水利、土壤、水文等的多方面。因此我认为在水土流失地区的有关专业学校里增加有关水土保持的课程，或者设立水土保持班，甚至创办水土保持学校是有重大意义的。从这些学校毕业出来的学生可以分配到各县、各农业合作社作为水土保持工作技术指导的骨干，并给农民传授水土保持的技术。
    加强水土保持的实验与科学研究工作也是很重要的问题。各部门在各地区设立的实验研究机构必须取得密切联系，交流经验，分工合作。
    水土保持工作对于发展农业林业牧业生产，既然有着这样重大的意义，而它对于三门峡水利枢纽也有着非常重大的作用，但是目前在水土保持的组织领导上问题还是很多的。我认为我们在口头上对于这一工作是重视了，但在行动上并没有表现出来，恰恰相反，我们的工作是松懈了。解放后黄河流域水土保持完成的面积是六万七千八百九十二平方公里，其中一九五五年底以前完成的是二万五千一百一十二平方公里，约占总工作量的百分之三十七。一九五六年是水土保持工作达到高潮的一年，计完成三万七千二百三十平方公里，占总工作量的百分之五十五，但是一九五七年截至四月为止，在水土保持主要工作季节里，黄河流域陕、甘、晋、豫、内蒙、青各省只完成计划数二万五千五百五十平方公里的百分之二十二，计五千五百五十平方公里。在今年很多地方就表现得劲头不够大，个别地方甚至情绪低落。这种现象发生的主要原因首先是组织机构不健全。有些省由于精减机构把已设的水土保持局取消了，改成了厅属处，县水土保持科并入县农、林、水利局一个股。原水土保持工作人员也有调动，失去了专业机构的指导作用。在党政抓得差的县就有了自流现象。各地区水土保持发展很不平衡。造成这种现象的原因我认为中央有关领导部门都有责任。全国水土保持委员会酝酿了很长的时期，但成立得很迟。水利部把黄河中游各省水土保持的计划、技术指导等任务交由黄委会负责，而黄委会对于这个工作是有责无权的。我认为在水土保持重点区，自中央到省县以至于区乡都应建立强有力的水土保持机构。最好把重点区的县，农、林、牧、水各部门合并成立一个统一的水土保持机构。重点省除现有各厅外，再成立一个水土保持厅，如山西、甘肃、陕西都应设立水土保持厅（或局）（陕西已设），以便统一地、具体地掌握该省各重点县的水土保持工作。黄委会可作为中央的派出机构，它的主要任务是指导所属流域内的水土保持工作。
    我希望中央水土保持委员会必须把各有关部门组织起来，研究如何加强黄河中游有关水土保持的组织机构问题，研究水土保持工作的如何协作与推进问题，并责成黄委会在各有关机关的支援与合作下作好水土保持远景计划和十年计划。中央水土保持委员会，必须加强对各省各有关部门水土保持工作的领导，在重点区把水土保持工作作为合作社的主要任务之一，抽调适当的劳动力认真地按照计划施行。
    以上仅是初步意见，请各位加以研讨与指导。但必须指出：水土保持是根治黄河的基本重要工作！在旧政权的统治下，在个体农民私有制度下，这种工作是不可能进行的。只有在优越的社会主义制度下，在农业合作化的制度下，才有可能作好这一工作。这也说明了只有在社会主义制度下，根治黄河的伟大事业才有实现的可能。但必须深刻认识：如果照今年这样轻视这种治黄的关键性水土保持工作，不即加以纠正，则三门峡水利枢纽工程的利用年限，必因之缩短。我相信，只要我们重视水土保持工作，积极地研究并推进这一工作，我们是有信心达到增加生产和控制泥沙的目的的！
