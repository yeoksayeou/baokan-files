Written Beside the Sickbed
Li Chengan's Speech

After hearing Premier Zhou's report on June 26th, I was hospitalized due to illness and originally didn't plan to speak. However, after seeing Elder Mr. Xiao Longyou's written speech from his sickbed, I decided to share my thoughts.

First, I'd like to report on the work situation of our National Bureau of Metrology.

Although our bureau has been established for over two years and has made some efforts, due to insufficient personnel and equipment, it cannot yet serve the rapidly developing economic construction as required. So far, we have only done some preparatory work. Since the end of last year, when our bureau's business came under the guidance of the National Technology Commission, the work has become more active recently.

This spring, the State Council also instructed all provinces and cities to establish metrology institutions. The National Technology Commission also plans to merge the metrology section of the Tool Science Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building with our bureau for reorganization, to enrich technical expertise and equipment. This is currently in preparation. At the same time, the central industrial departments also feel that without standardized metrology, they cannot evaluate their achievements. From now on, our bureau's metrology work can be expected to develop under the effective guidance of the National Technology Commission, with the manpower and financial support of the central industrial departments and the people's committees of various provinces and cities. In this way, it can play a certain role in the standardization, cooperation, automation, and interchangeability of industrial production; it can also ensure the correctness and fairness of transactions, hygiene, safety, and so on. Of course, this will require the efforts of all staff members of our bureau to achieve this goal, and we ask for your continued supervision.

As for the names of the units of measurement that everyone is looking forward to, they are still under research and consultation. It is impossible to get completely unanimous opinions on this matter. I hope that all parties will abandon their prejudices and come up with a more appropriate plan so that it can be determined as soon as possible.

Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of right-wing elements.

The People's Republic of China is the best country that China has ever had. The socialist communist system is the most ideal and superior system in the world, and it is also the highest form of social system for humanity. The people's democratic dictatorship is very necessary at this moment when there are still counter-revolutionary elements at home and abroad; without democracy, it is impossible to widely absorb the opinions of the masses, and without centralization, it is a scattered mess and impossible to carry out work. Therefore, democratic centralism is the best way. Now the main people in various organs are not necessarily all Party members. Even if some departments have more Party members, it is due to the needs of the nature of the work. In fact, there is no situation of "the Party rules the world." Since the national system is a socialist system, its policies and guidelines must be carried out in accordance with this system; the Party's leadership is the leadership of policies and guidelines, which is necessary. Some people say that the bourgeoisie now has no dual nature, and that fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income, which is even more far-fetched and unreasonable. Some people also say that people's lives have not improved since liberation, but just look at whether there are beggars in urban and rural areas, whether there are people starving to death, and you will know that this statement is incorrect. All these fallacies of the right-wing elements can only temporarily deceive some people with grievances, some people who are still angry about being wrongly criticized, some people with abnormal social relations, and some ignorant young people, but once they are explained and criticized, they may wake up and be easily changed. What I want to say is about a small number of right-wing elements who are people's representatives, hold important positions, and are also senior intellectuals. They are intentionally making trouble and intentionally undermining the country. If these people do not bow their heads to the people and confess their crimes, the people will not allow it. They should be treated as enemies and punished according to the law.

Third, thoroughly implement the Party's rectification movement and strengthen the political and ideological education of the general personnel.

This Party's rectification movement is to improve the Party's leadership, and asking non-Party members to help is to seriously carry out this movement well. Most of the current Party members were recruited after liberation and have not been tested by fierce struggles, and the Party's education is not enough. I believe that after exposing and criticizing the right-wing elements and drawing a clear line between them, we should take advantage of the rectification to train them well, which is necessary, I think it should be implemented. At the same time, we should strengthen the political and ideological study of the general non-Party personnel, and in addition to in-depth study of basic courses such as Marxism-Leninism and political economy, we should first pay attention to studying communist morality, such as Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "How to Be a Good Communist" should also be studied in depth.

Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of building the country through diligence and frugality.

Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and all the leaders have instructed us to build the country through diligence and frugality, and we should conscientiously abide by it. There is a lot of uncultivated land in our country, a lot of undeveloped resources, a lot of construction that has not yet been carried out, and a lot that needs to be done with accumulated funds. Therefore, we must all work diligently and frugally so that we can be self-reliant and build the country well.

I heard that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia still use old equipment for production, which is worth learning from us. The Chinese people have a good tradition of diligence and frugality, let's all carry it forward in our work and life!

### 写在病榻之旁  李承干的发言

    写在病榻之旁
    李承干的发言
    我于六月二十六日听到周总理报告后，就因病住医院，本来不打算发言。后来看到萧龙友老先生病中的书面发言，我才想谈一谈。
    首先，我汇报一下我们国家计量局的工作情况。
    我局成立以来，虽已两年多，虽然经过一些努力，但因人力和设备，都没有配齐，尚不能照目前的要求，为飞速发展的经济建设服务。迄今还只做了一点准备工作。从去年年底，我局业务归国家技术委员会指导后，近来工作较为活跃起来。
    今年春国务院又指示各省市成立计量机构，国家技术委员会又打算把第一机械工业部工具科学研究院计量部分和我局合并改组，以充实技术和设备力量，现正在准备中，同时中央各工业部门也感觉没有标准的计量就没法审定其成果。从此我局的计量工作，可望在国家技术委员会切实指导下，有中央各工业部门和各省市人民委员会的人力、财力的支援下得以开展。这样，也可以对工业生产的标准化、合作化、自动化和互换性起一定的作用；也可以使交易、卫生、安全等得到了正确公允的保证。当然这还要我局全体工作人员的努力才能达到目的，并请各方面多多督促。
    至于大家所期望的计量单位的名称，还在研究和征求意见中。这事不可能得到完全一致的意见，希望各方面破除成见，拟出较妥的方案，才可以及早确定下来。
    其次，我谈一谈关于右派分子的问题。
    中华人民共和国是中国自古以来所未有过的好国家。社会主义共产主义制度是世界上最理想最优越的制度，也是世界人类的最高形式的社会制度。人民民主专政，在目下国内外还有反革命分子的时候是非常必要的；不民主不能广泛吸收群众意见，不集中则一盘散沙无法执行工作，所以民主集中制是最好的办法。现在各机关的主要人不一定都是党员，就是少数部门党员人数多一些，也是由于工作性质的需要。事实上，并没有“党天下”的情况。国家制度既然是社会主义制度，其政策方针必须依照这制度进行；党的领导，就是政策方针的领导，这是必要的。有些人说资产阶级现在没有两面性，定息不是剥削而是不劳而获，更是牵强不合理之谈。又有人说解放以来人民生活没有改善，那只要看看城乡有没有乞丐，有没有饿死人的现象就会知道这种说法是不对的。凡此种种右派分子谬论，只有一些心里有疙瘩的人，一些被误斗过还存在气愤的人，一些社会关系不正常的人，一些无知的青年，才会一时被蒙蔽，但一经解释和批评可能就会醒悟，容易改变过来。我所要说的，只是少数身当人民代表身任要职又是高级知识分子那些右派分子的人。他们是有意捣乱，有意破坏国家。这些人如不向人民俯首认罪，人民是不会允许的。应当把他们当做敌人看待，治以国法。
    第三，贯彻党的整风运动并加强一般人员的政治思想教育。
    这次党的整风运动是为了搞好党的领导，要党外人士帮助是想认真把这运动搞好。现在的党员大多数是解放后吸收的，没有受过剧烈斗争的考验，党的教育还不够，我以为在揭发和批判了右派分子并与他们划清界限之后，应该借整风好好把他们锻炼起来，这是必要的，我认为应该贯彻下去。同时更应该加强一般党外人员的政治思想学习，而学习除应深刻学习马列主义、政治经济学等基础课外，首先应注意着重学习共产主义道德，如刘少奇委员长所著的“党员的修养”也该深入学习。
    最后，我谈一谈勤俭建国问题。
    毛主席、周总理和各首长都指示我们要勤俭建国，我们应该切实遵守。我国未开垦的地很多，未开发的资源很多，应该建设还未建设的很多，有待积累资金来做的很多。所以我们大家要勤俭做去，才能自力更生，把国家建设好。
    听说苏联和捷克斯洛伐克有很多还利用旧设备生产，这是值得我们学习的。我国人民有优良的勤俭传统，大家在工作和生活中发扬起来吧！
