Medicinal Materials
    Zhangpu Farmers Dig Amber
    Last August, a large amount of amber was discovered in the Louzai Xie Mountain area of Lindai Township, Zhangpu County, attracting many farmers to dig. Since last August, the county supply and marketing cooperative has purchased more than 300,000 taels of amber, increasing farmers' income by more than 200,000 yuan.
    The amber mined here is of good quality, with the largest piece weighing more than 100 taels. It is said that there are still many amber deposits here.
    Amber is a precious Chinese medicinal material and a good medicine for treating convulsions and spasms. In the past, due to low domestic production, it was imported from abroad every year.

    Astragalus King
    When farmers in Shangyi County, Hebei Province, were collecting herbs in the deep mountains, they dug up a large wild astragalus that had been growing for many years, which the farmers called the "Astragalus King." This astragalus is about five Chinese feet long, as thick as a bowl, about two inches thick, and weighs about three Chinese catties.
    The depths of the Daqing Mountains in Shangyi County contain a large amount of astragalus. In addition to most of it being wild, some planted but unexcavated astragalus has also been found. According to local farmers, it was planted before the "July 7th" Incident. In order to guide farmers in developing sideline occupations and opening up medicinal resources, the county supply and marketing cooperative has mobilized farmers to vigorously excavate. It is estimated that more than 50,000 catties of astragalus can be excavated this year.

    药材
    漳浦农民挖琥珀
    去年8月，漳浦县林棣乡楼仔谢山一带发现了大量琥珀，吸引了很多农民挖掘。从去年8月份以来，县供销社收购琥珀三十多万两，农民增加收入达二十余万元。
    这里开采的琥珀质量很好，最大的块有一百多两，据说，这里琥珀蕴藏量还很多。
    琥珀是珍贵的中药材，是医治抽搐、痉挛的良药，以往由于国内生产不多，历年有向外进口。

    黄蓍王
    河北省尚义县农民在深山采药时，刨出一棵多年野生的大黄蓍，农民称其为“黄蓍王”。这棵黄蓍长约五市尺，粗如碗口，约二寸余，重约三市斤。
    尚义县大青山深处，蕴藏着大量黄蓍，除大部为野生者外，并发现有种植未刨者一部，据当地农民反映系“七七”事变前种植的。县供销社为领导农民开展副业和开辟药源，已发动农民大力刨采。预计今年可刨采黄蓍五万多斤。
