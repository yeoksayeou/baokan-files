    In February 1956, an iron ore prospecting team in the Qilian Mountains began large-scale geological exploration work. Since then, in the Qilian Mountains, covering more than 3,000 square kilometers, every mountain top has been marked by the glorious footprints of geological survey personnel. In some major mining areas, there are exciting sounds of blasting and the roar of machines every day; the Qilian Mountains, which have been dormant for thousands of years, are awakening.

    The Qilian Mountains are one of China's major mountain ranges, bordering Qinghai and Gansu, winding more than a thousand kilometers from west to east, rising from three thousand to five thousand meters above sea level. The area currently being explored for iron ore is named Jingtieshan (Mirror Iron Mountain) by the geological personnel, because the ore has a high iron content and is as black and shiny as a mirror. At the same time, the mining area is very large, with one mountain connected to another endlessly. People say: "Mountain connects to mountain, mountain touches the sky, Jingtieshan, boundless and wide." The peaks of Jingtieshan also reach three to four thousand meters, covered with red and yellow ore, without a single blade of grass, and are extremely steep and difficult to traverse. Therefore, someone has composed this rhyme:

    Everyone says Mount Hua is high,
    Mount Hua rests on the waist of Iron Mountain.
    Since ancient times, Mount Hua has had only one path,
    Iron Mountain has not even one small path.
    Prospectors sent from Beijing,
    Transform a knife-edged mountain into a broad avenue.

    When the geological team first arrived, the lack of roads made the transportation of supplies the biggest problem. When supplies could not be transported in, people were underfed for several days and almost ran out of food. So, the first priority was to rush to repair the road. This was in winter, and the road construction workers were building roads at an altitude of 4,100 meters. The air was thin, and sometimes people would suddenly faint while walking. After waking up, they would continue to work, eating a mouthful of steamed bun and biting on ice for each meal. One snowy night, the tent was blown away by the wind. People were too tired to get up. When they woke up at dawn, they were all buried in the snow. They climbed out of the snow and continued to work as usual. These unforgettable heroes finally overcame altitude sickness and severe cold, and completed the construction of more than a hundred *li* of road in forty days. Worker Li Rongcai composed a rhythmic clapper talk: "Not afraid of mountains ten thousand *zhang* high, not afraid of rivers frozen into ice, not afraid of snow three *chi* deep, not afraid of fierce winds blowing; even if only one meal a day, even if the stomach is empty for two days. For the early industrialization of the motherland, for the happiness of the people of the whole country..."

    The climate in the mountains changes greatly, with a temperature difference of thirty degrees between morning and evening and noon. The snow on the peaks does not melt all year round. The hardest time is winter, and the hardest work is the night shift. Due to insufficient coal supply, they collect some firewood in the mountain valleys during the day, leaving it for the second half of the night shift to keep warm. Last winter, the water pipes around the mining area were frozen and burst. The water in the pipes turned into ice sticks, the drilling rigs stopped, and it looked like the completion of the drilling task would be greatly affected. So, the team mobilized all the workers to repair the water pipes day and night. Iron Mountain immediately became lively, with people everywhere on the mountain and down below. At this time, the temperature had dropped to more than minus thirty degrees Celsius, and it was impossible to extend your hands. On a hillside, driller Zheng Wanchun and two others were cutting the frozen and damaged water pipes, each with a finger-thick safety rope tied around their waist, the other end of the rope held by people on the mountain. They fought the severe cold in this way for a week, all the water pipes were repaired, and the drilling rigs started up as usual. There are also moving stories among the field survey personnel. One day, Wei Xixian's group climbed a dangerous mountain peak at an altitude of 4,000 meters to conduct geological surveys. The mountain peak is covered with snow all year round. Not to mention carrying measuring instruments on their backs, it is difficult to climb up even with empty hands. But their work required them to climb up. To prevent the snow from causing people to slide down, they took turns placing their hands on the rocks, letting others step on their hands to climb over. Sometimes, when going downhill, in addition to using their hands as feet and crawling backwards, they also had to use their buttocks to push against the ground. That day, they worked until dusk before descending the mountain. It was already dark, and they fumbled their way down. Carelessly, Wei Xixian rolled down into a ravine more than ten meters deep. But the excitement of completing the survey task supported him to climb a higher mountain the next day.

    In this team, there are also three female geological workers. They are all very young, looking no more than twenty years old, but they are very determined and have never said "afraid," "can't," or "can't do it." They can go wherever the male comrades can go, and they can do whatever the male comrades can do. In September last year, not long after they arrived, they climbed the highest mountain in the mining area, Heigou (Black Gully), for the first time. Some male comrades led them, but they refused to fall behind and walked even faster than them. These female geological personnel are graduates of the Nanjing Geological School or the Wuhan Geological School. Now climbing mountains is a very ordinary thing for them. It used to take several hours to climb from the foot of the mountain to the drilling rig halfway up the mountain, but now it takes less than an hour. People see their brave and vigorous appearance and affectionately call them "wild girls."

    There are many people in the prospecting team who are not afraid of difficulties like this. Wherever you go, when you ask them, "How is it, are the conditions here harsh?" they will proudly say, "It's nothing, we are the pioneers of industry!" It is on these brave people that the team relied to overfulfill the task of iron ore reserve exploration last year. In the first quarter of this year, core drilling and trench exploration also overfulfilled the plan.

    This iron ore prospecting team in the Qilian Mountains will not only work well but also live well. One night, the scenery was beautiful: the moon hung on the top of the mountain like a silver-white balloon, reflecting the snow on the mountain peaks. On a flat ground by a winding river, the geological team members held a moonlight dance party. Accompanied by two *huqin*, a harmonica, and a copper washbasin, people danced gracefully. Soviet experts and Vice Minister of Geology Liu Jingfan also participated and praised this unique dance party. In addition, the prospecting team often shows movies; the Communist Youth League sometimes organizes field trips on holidays. Although life here is hard, they feel happy. They want to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the barren mountains.

    祁连山区的铁矿勘探队
    新华社记者　孙晶
    1956年2月，祁连山的一支铁矿勘探队，开始了大规模的地质勘探工作。从此在三千多平方公里的祁连山区，每个山头都留下了地质普查人员的光荣足迹。有些主要矿区，每天都有动人心弦的爆破声和机器的轰鸣声；几千年来沉睡的祁连山苏醒了。
    祁连山是我国的大山脉之一，界于青海和甘肃之间，从西向东蜿蜒千多公里，拔海三千公尺到五千公尺。目前正进行勘探铁矿的地方，地质人员起名为镜铁山，矿石中含铁量高，又黑又亮像镜子一样。同时矿区很大，一个山接一个山连绵不断，人们说：山连山、山接天，镜铁山，大无边。镜铁山各峰也都高达三、四千公尺，山上是红一片、黄一片的矿石，寸草不生，陡峭险峻非常难行。因此，有人编出这样一段顺口溜：
    人人都说华山高，
    华山搭在铁山腰。
    自古华山一条路，
    铁山小路无一条。
    北京派来探宝人，
    刀山走成阳关道。
    地质队刚来时，由于没有路，物资运输成了最大问题。东西运不进来，有好几天人们吃不饱饭，几乎绝了粮。于是首先抢修公路。这时正是冬天，筑路职工在拔海四千一百公尺高的地方修路。空气稀薄，有时人走着走着就突然昏倒，呆会醒来又继续干活，每顿饭吃口馍咬口冰。一个风雪之夜，帐篷给风刮跑了，人们懒得起来，天亮时一看，个个埋在雪里，人从雪堆里爬起来照常工作。这些使人永远不能忘记的英雄们，终于战胜了气喘和严寒，在四十天内就把一百多华里的公路修好了。工人李荣财编快板说：不怕高山高万丈，不怕河水冻成冰，不怕大雪三尺深，不怕狂风刮的凶；哪怕一天一顿饭，哪怕两天肚里空。祖国早日工业化，全国人民幸福大……。
    山里的气候变化大，早晚和中午相差三十度。高峰的积雪终年不化。最苦的时候是冬季，最苦的工作算夜班。由于煤炭供应不足，他们白天在山沟里弄些柴草，都留给下半夜的一班取暖用。去年冬季，围绕矿区各个山的水管给冻坏了，水管里的水变成了冰棍，钻机停钻了，眼看要大大影响钻探任务的完成。于是队上动员全体职工日夜抢修水管。铁山顿时热闹起来，山上山下到处是人，这时气温已降到摄氏零下三十多度，手都伸不出来。在一个山腰上，钻工郑万春和另外两个人在切割冻坏的水管，每人腰上绑着一条手指头粗的安全绳，绳的另一头由山上的人把着。就这样和严寒战斗了一个礼拜，水管全部修好，钻机照常开动起来。在野外普查人员中也有动人事迹。有一天，尉希贤小组爬上拔海四千公尺的一个险要山头，进行地质测量。山峰常年积雪，不要说背上测量仪器，就是空手也难爬上去。但是工作要求他们爬上去。为了防止雪把人滑下来，他们互把手垫在石头上，让别人从自己的手上踏过去。有时在下坡时除了手当脚仰面爬行外，还要加上屁股顶地。这天，直工作到黄昏才下山。天已经黑了，他们摸索着往下溜，一不小心，尉希贤滚下了十多公尺深的山沟。但是完成测量任务的兴奋心情，支持着他第二天又去爬一座更高的山。
    在这队里还有三位女地质工作者，她们都很年轻，看起来不过二十岁的样子，但她们非常要强，从来没有过“怕”“不行”或“干不了”，男同志能到的地方她们也能到，男同志能做的事情她们也能做。去年9月，她们刚来不久，第一次爬矿区中最高的山——黑沟，有男同志带她们走，但她们不肯落后，走的比他们还快。这些女地质人员，有的是从南京地质学校毕业的，有的是从武汉地质学校毕业的。现在爬山对她们来说，已经是很普通的事了。开始从山下爬到山腰的钻机上要好几个小时，现在不到一小时就爬完了。人们看到她们那种勇敢矫健的样子，就亲切地称呼“野姑娘”。
    在勘探队里像这样不怕困难的人多得很，随便走到哪里，当你问到她们：“怎么样，这里条件苦吧？”她们会神气地说：“没甚么，我们是工业上的尖兵！”就靠这些勇敢的人，这个队去年超额完成了铁矿的储量勘探任务。今年第一季度岩心钻探和槽探等也都超额完成计划。
    祁连山里的这支铁矿勘探队，不但会很好地工作，同时也会很好地生活。有一天夜晚，景色很美：月亮像银白色气球似的挂在山顶上，同山峰积雪相映。在一条弯弯曲曲的小河边的平地上，地质队员们召开了月光舞会。在两把胡琴、一个口琴和一个铜脸盆伴奏下，人们翩翩起舞。苏联专家和地质部副部长刘景范也参加了，不绝口地赞美这个独具风格的舞会。此外，勘探队还经常放映电影；青年团有时在假日组织野游。这里的生活虽然艰苦，但是他们感到愉快，他们要在荒山里生根、开花结果。
