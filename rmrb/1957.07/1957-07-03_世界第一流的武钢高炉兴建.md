    Construction Begins on World-Class Wuhan Steel Plant Blast Furnace
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan, July 1st) The first blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise officially began construction on July 1st, one month ahead of schedule.
    The Wuhan Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace is currently our country's largest and most advanced iron smelting blast furnace. Its production scale and equipment are world-class. After this blast furnace goes into production at the end of next year, it will increase our country's steel production by more than one-sixth on the current basis. The iron it produces in one day can be made into steel to lay more than fifty kilometers of railway, or make one hundred thousand double-wheeled double-share plows, or make two million iron pots.
    The builders of the No. 1 Blast Furnace held a groundbreaking ceremony on the 1st. Construction site director Han Xi, representing all the staff and workers constructing the No. 1 Blast Furnace, resolutely stated after receiving the construction order: The No. 1 Blast Furnace is one of the country's model projects, and we must, in accordance with the model requirements, ensure the fastest speed, the best quality, the highest labor efficiency, the lowest cost, and the safest construction to build the No. 1 Blast Furnace well.
    Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Yiqing, General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Soviet expert Savitsky, and representatives from all aspects of Wuhan spoke at the meeting. Wang Renzhong said: The commencement of construction of the No. 1 Blast Furnace on the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Party is of great significance. After thirty-six years of arduous struggle, the Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country to transform poor China into the prosperous and strong country it is today, which cannot be denied by right-wing elements and all anti-communist reactionaries. Today, we have not only built many factories and the Yangtze River Bridge, but we are also building a world-class blast furnace. This heroic spirit of our Chinese Communist Party and the working class in building socialism will disappoint right-wing elements and all anti-communist reactionaries once again!

    “七一”这一天
    世界第一流的武钢高炉兴建
    本报武汉1日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的第一号高炉，比原计划提前一个月在7月1日正式开工兴建。
    武钢一号高炉是我国目前最大最新型的炼铁高炉。它的生产规模和设备是世界第一流的。这座高炉在明年年底投入生产以后，将使我国钢铁产量在现有基础上提高六分之一以上。它一昼夜生产的铁制成钢材以后，可以铺五十多公里铁路，或制十万部双轮双铧犁，或做二百万只铁锅。
    一号高炉的建设者在1日举行了开工典礼。工地主任韩喜代表建设一号高炉的全体职工接受开工命令以后坚决表示：一号高炉是国家示范工程之一，我们一定要根据示范要求，保证以最快的速度，最好的质量，最高的劳动效率，最低的成本和最安全的施工，把一号高炉建设好。
    中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、武汉钢铁公司总经理李一清、苏联专家萨维斯基和武汉市各方面的代表在会上讲了话。王任重说：一号高炉在党的三十六周年纪念日开工是有很大意义的。中国共产党经过三十六年艰苦奋斗，领导全国人民把穷困的中国变成今天这样富强，这是右派分子和一切敌视共产党的反动派所抹杀不了的。今天我们不仅已经建设了许多工厂，建设了长江大桥，我们又在建设世界第一流的高炉。我们中国共产党和工人阶级这种建设社会主义的英雄气概，将使右派分子和一切敌视共产党的反动派再一次失望！
