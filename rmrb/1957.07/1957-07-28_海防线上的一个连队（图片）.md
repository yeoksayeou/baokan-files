A Company on the Coastal Defense Line

The 7th Company of a certain People's Liberation Army unit stationed on a certain island on the front line of the East China Sea is a company with harmonious military-civilian relations and solid unity between officers and soldiers.

The 7th Company has been stationed on this island for a long time. They closely rely on the masses, regarding the interests of the masses as their own. Whenever the masses encounter difficulties, they try their best to help them solve them. One day, a typhoon struck, and the fishermen were worried about the fishing boats moored by the sea. Seeing the emergency, the 7th Company immediately stopped training and mobilized all its personnel to rescue the fishing boats for the fishermen, preserving the "rice bowl" of the fishermen on the island.

The busy farming season and the fishing season arrived simultaneously. Fishermen went out to sea to fish, and there were very few male laborers participating in agricultural production. At this time, it all depended on the troops to help the masses with rush planting, weeding, and harvesting... It is also a good habit of the 7th Company to help the masses with housework. After training, the soldiers scrambled to sweep the yards, carry water, and do all kinds of things they could do for the masses. In every home near the area where the troops were stationed, the "water vat" was always kept full.

The troops love the people, and the people also love the troops. The local women voluntarily organized laundry groups and often sewed and washed clothes for the soldiers of the 7th Company; when the troops' housing was not enough, the people would rather use less space themselves so that the troops could have housing. During the New Year and other festivals, the people always prepared good food and dishes and invited the comrades of the troops to their homes as guests. The 7th Company has formed a close relationship with the local people, like fish and water, inseparable.

The atmosphere of respecting officers and cherishing soldiers is also very strong in the 7th Company. They are so serious and earnest in intense military training and busy operations; when it comes to rest time, they become so lively and amiable. Company Commander Dong Anguo is very good at telling stories, and the soldiers often surround him, asking him to bring out his fresh "works." There is no restraint between officers and soldiers, and they are as united as brothers. The officers take meticulous care of the soldiers, often appearing by their side late at night to see if the soldiers are sleeping well, whether the quilts are tucked in tightly, and whether there are gaps in the mosquito nets. When the soldiers are sick, the officers take care of them day and night, asking about their health and warmth, until their illnesses are completely cured. Every soldier experiences that he is living in a warm revolutionary family.

The 7th Company has gained unparalleled strength in close military-civilian and officer-soldier relations. No matter what arduous tasks they have, they always achieve excellent results. Not long ago, the higher authorities awarded the 7th Company a banner that read "Awarded to the Second-Class Advanced Operations Company."

    海防线上的一个连队
    驻守在祖国东海前线某岛的人民解放军某部七连，是一个军民关系融洽，官兵团结无间的连队。
    七连同这个岛上的群众相处的时间已经很长了。他们紧紧地依靠群众，把群众的利益看作自己的利益，每当群众遇到困难，他们就想尽一切办法帮助解决。有一天，台风袭来，渔民们都为泊在海边的渔船担心。七连看见情况紧急，立即停止操课，全体出动，替渔民抢救渔船，保住了岛上渔民的“饭碗”。
  农忙季节和渔汛期同时到来。渔民们纷纷出海捕鱼，参加农业生产的男劳动力就很少了。这时候，全靠部队帮助群众抢插、拔草、收割……。帮助群众进行家务劳动，也是七连的好习惯。每当操课完毕，战士们争着为群众扫院子、担水和做各种能做的事情。在部队驻区附近的每一个家里，经常保持着“水满缸”。
    部队爱护群众，群众也爱护部队。当地妇女们自动组织了洗衣小组，经常给七连的战士们缝洗衣服；当部队的房子不够住的时候，群众宁愿自己少用一点，也要让部队住上房子。每逢过年过节，群众总要做些好饭、好菜，请部队的同志们到家里作客。七连同当地群众已经结成了鱼水不可分的密切关系。
    尊干爱兵的空气在七连也是很浓厚的。在紧张的军训和繁忙的作业中，他们是那样地严肃认真；到了休息的时候，就变得那样活泼和亲切。连长董安国很会讲故事，战士们常常围着他，要他把新鲜的“作品”拿出来。官兵之间毫无拘束，团结得像是亲兄弟一样。军官爱护士兵也是无微不至，在夜深人静的时候，他们常常出现在士兵身边，看士兵睡得好不好，被子盖严了没有，蚊帐是不是有空隙。士兵们病了，军官们更是不管白天黑夜，问寒问暖，直到把他们的病完全治好。每一个士兵都体验到自己是生活在温暖的革命大家庭里。
    七连在亲密的军民关系和官兵关系中，取得了无比的坚强力量。不论有了什么样的艰巨任务，他们总是获得优良的成绩。不久以前，上级发给七连一面写着“奖给二级先进作业连”的锦旗。
