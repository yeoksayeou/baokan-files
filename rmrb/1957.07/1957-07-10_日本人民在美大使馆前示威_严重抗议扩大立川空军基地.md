Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th. Approximately 500 residents of Sunagawa Town near Tokyo, along with workers, students, and Socialist Party Diet members, demonstrated in front of the US Embassy in Tokyo today, strongly protesting the US expansion of the Tachikawa Air Base.

The demonstrating masses shouted slogans in front of the US Embassy: "Yankees go home," "Stop expanding the Tachikawa base," "Stop militarizing Okinawa," "Withdraw US troops from Okinawa," and "We oppose nuclear weapons testing."

During the two-hour demonstration, red flags held by the masses in front of the US Embassy fluttered in the wind, and songs resounded.

The Japanese government deployed approximately 400 police officers, two armored vehicles, and more than a dozen military trucks to protect the US Embassy and blocked the embassy's gates, preventing the demonstrators from entering. Five representatives of the demonstrators were allowed to enter the embassy and submit a protest letter to US officials addressed to US President Eisenhower, strongly protesting the US disregard for the opposition of the Japanese people, forcibly expanding the Tachikawa Air Base, and conducting atomic war preparations. This protest letter was adopted yesterday at a mass rally in Sunagawa Town attended by approximately 3,000 people.

The demonstrators then went to the Procurement Agency and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to protest their dispatch of police to forcibly survey the land of residents in Sunagawa Town.

To expand the US Tachikawa Air Base, the Japanese government yesterday dispatched 2,000 police officers and more than a dozen armored vehicles to forcibly survey the land of residents in Sunagawa Town.

The Tachikawa Air Base is the largest US air base in Japan. The US plans to expand the runway of this base to accommodate jet aircraft. The Japanese public believes that this is one of the steps taken by the US to establish an atomic weapons base in Japan. Since the US proposed this plan in the spring of 1955, the Japanese people have been opposing it. The expansion of the base has not been completed. (Attached photo)

On June 27, US military police obstructed the masses in Sunagawa from driving away the Japanese authorities' survey team and injured three students. The picture shows the confrontation between Japanese students and US military police.

    日本人民在美大使馆前示威
    严重抗议扩大立川空军基地
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本东京附近砂川町的居民和工人、学生、社会党国会议员共约五百人，今天在东京美国大使馆前举行示威，强烈抗议美国扩大立川空军基地。
    示威群众在美国大使馆前高呼：“美国佬滚回去”，“停止扩大立川基地”，“停止把冲绳岛军事基地化”，“从冲绳岛撤走美国军队”，“我们反对核武器试验”。
    在两小时的示威过程中，美国大使馆前群众手执的红旗迎风招展，歌声沸腾。
    日本政府出动了约四百名警察、两辆装甲车和十几辆军用卡车，来保护美国大使馆，并且把住了大使馆的大门，阻止示威群众进入。示威群众的五位代表被允许进入大使馆，向美国官员提交了给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一项抗议书，严重抗议美国不顾日本人民的反对，强行扩大立川空军基地和进行原子战争准备。这项抗议书是昨天在砂川町举行的约有三千人参加的群众大会上通过的。
    示威群众随后又到调达厅和东京警视厅，抗议它们出动警察强制测量砂川町居民的土地。
    为了扩大美国立川空军基地，日本政府昨天出动两千名警察和十几辆装甲车，强行测量了砂川町居民的土地。
    立川空军基地是美国在日本的最大的一个空军基地。美国计划扩大这个基地的飞机跑道，以便供喷气式飞机使用。日本公众认为，这是美国在日本建立原子武器基地的步骤之一。从1955年春天美国提出这个计划起，日本人民就一直在反对美国的这个计划。扩大基地的工作一直没有完成。（附图片）
