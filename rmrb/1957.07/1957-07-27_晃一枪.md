    A Quick Shot
    Man Jia
    Upon seeing the gambling stake about to be lost,
    A quick shot is fired before the battle.
    Troops are withdrawn,
    And they slip through the gate.
    Coming up with a desperate denial.

    晃一枪
    漫家
    一见赌本快输光，
    阵前连忙晃一枪。
    收了兵，
    滑过关。
    来个抵死不认账。
