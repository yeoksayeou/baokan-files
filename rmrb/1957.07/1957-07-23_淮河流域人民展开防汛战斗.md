Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 22nd July: People in the Huai River basin have launched an intense battle against flooding. Continuous heavy rains since July 6th have put the rivers in northern Anhui on alert; the vast population in the relevant areas of Henan, Anhui, and Shandong are bravely defending under the leadership of cadres from relevant departments.

This year, the heavy rains in the Huai River are mainly concentrated in the middle area south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River. The medium and small tributaries in northern Anhui that have been hit by rainstorms are all in a state of emergency. The amount of rainfall and flooding in many places is unprecedented.

Due to the unprecedented concentration and continuity of heavy rains, the floodwaters have exceeded the drainage capacity of the riverbeds, resulting in dyke breaches and overflows in several rivers hit by the rainstorms. Currently, all breaches and dangerous dyke sections are being urgently repaired and defended day and night. In areas where breaches have been closed, local governments are organizing the vast number of farmers to rush to drain water and replant late-autumn crops.

Yesterday, the water situation in all rivers except the Shaying River showed a slow easing trend. The water level in Linyi of the Yishu River has also stopped rising. As forecasts indicate the possibility of more heavy rains in the Huai River basin, all dyke patrol workers and cadres have strengthened their vigilance.

The rainfall in the main stream of the Huai River has been light recently, and the water situation is very stable.

    淮河流域人民展开防汛战斗
    新华社蚌埠22日电　淮河流域人民展开了紧张的防汛战斗。7月6日以来的连续暴雨，使淮北地区河流告急；河南、安徽、山东各有关地区的广大人民，正在各有关部门干部率领下英勇防守中。
    今年，淮河暴雨主要集中在黄河以南、淮河以北的中间地区，遭受暴风雨袭击的淮北各中、支流，都处于紧急状态，许多地方的雨量和洪水量为历年所未有。
    由于暴雨空前集中、连续，洪水超过了河床的排水能力，因而遭受暴雨袭击的几条河流，出现了破堤漫溢的现象。目前所有决口和险要堤段都在昼夜抢堵、防守。堵口完竣的地方，当地政府正组织广大农民突击排水，补种晚秋作物。
    昨天，各河水情除沙颍河外，都有缓轻之势。沂沭河的临沂水位也停止上涨。由于预报淮河流域仍有暴雨出现可能，所有巡堤民工、干部都加强了警惕。
    淮河干流最近雨量不大，水情十分平稳。
