My heart is very heavy as I speak to you all today. At the beginning of the conference, I thought I had made mistakes in my thinking, but later I realized that I had made serious political mistakes, the most fundamental mistake of whether China should take the capitalist road or the socialist road.

In the past, I used to call myself "progressive," but since the Party's rectification movement began in early May, I have completely exposed my ugly face.

First, I became the convener of the "relevant school leadership system" in the four temporary working groups that the Zhang-Luo group conspired to plan (according to the materials confessed by Zhang Bojun and Pu Xixiu themselves, they originally intended to appoint Fei Xiaotong as the convener of this group, but Fei Xiaotong had not returned at that time, so they appointed me). On May 13th, I also convened a small meeting and drafted "Our Suggestions on the School Leadership System (Draft)". Although I criticized the anti-socialist fallacies of "Party and League withdrawing from schools" and "professors running schools" in this document, this cannot hide the fact that the document itself is also anti-Party. For example, I said "to strengthen the Party's leadership and democratic school management," but since we want to strengthen the Party's leadership, how can we have "democratic school management"? Isn't this putting the Party's leadership and democracy in opposition to each other? Isn't this making the strengthening of the Party's leadership empty talk, while "democratic school management" is the real thing? Of course, this is very suitable for Zhang and Luo's purpose of usurping school leadership. Secondly, in this document, I emphasized the Party's political and ideological leadership, but completely ignored the Party's organizational leadership in schools. If the Party does not control the personnel and financial power in schools, then wouldn't its leadership lack a material basis? I said verbally that I wanted to strengthen the Party's leadership, but in reality, it was exactly the opposite, weakening the Party's leadership. Thirdly, on the one hand, I said that the Party committee or Party group should be the core of leadership, while on the other hand, I said that the school affairs committee is the highest leading body. In this way, the principal becomes an executor of the school affairs committee, with only democracy and no centralization. The leading core of the Party group would also be difficult to embody. Obviously, these are all programmatic errors. Although this document is a "draft" and "initial draft" and has not been published, I dare not hide it and have now handed it over to the Guangdong group to forward to the Standing Committee as material for examining my mistakes.

Secondly, when I offered opinions to the leaders of the Normal University, I did not offer opinions based on the spirit of unity and assisting the Party in doing a good job, but instead launched vicious attacks on the Party's leadership at the Normal University. I did not emphasize the aspect that intellectuals should seriously reform themselves, but instead emphasized the progressive aspect of intellectuals. At the same time, I mistakenly believed that it was possible for bourgeois intellectuals to usurp leadership in schools in the early days of liberation, but that it was no longer possible now. The reason is that now all systems have been established, and ordinary intellectuals are unwilling to engage in administrative work, and doing administrative work now is not like in the Kuomintang era where they could use it to get promoted and make a fortune, and so on. But I did not estimate that although bourgeois intellectuals themselves may not have the ambition to seize power, they always attempt to transform the world with their own worldview. For schools, this means attempting to run schools in a bourgeois way. The Zhang-Luo incident proves that the bourgeoisie does indeed harbor the ambition to seize school leadership, and I happened to be their tool objectively. Regarding my speech at the faculty and staff symposium of the Chinese Department of the Normal University on June 5th, I will examine it in the Chinese Department of the Normal University in the future, and I will not elaborate on it here.

Third, I participated in the gathering of the Cultural Club convened by Zhang Bojun on June 6th. Regardless of whether I heard Zhang Bojun's gathering on June 5th and Zhang Bojun's initial speech on June 6th, my own speech was ridiculous enough. For example, I said that after 1953, the Party no longer trusted non-Party intellectuals. In fact, the Party trusts non-Party intellectuals very much. Does the Party not trust Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji? The problem is that they are not trustworthy. And if an intellectual is unwilling to seriously reform himself, even if the Party trusts him, there will be big problems. Secondly, I said, "The Party's policy of 'unity, education, and transformation' towards intellectuals is actually implemented in Beijing as a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation." Perhaps in individual organs, individual Party members have such phenomena, but I generalized it as a phenomenon of the entire Beijing Party. This is clearly a slander against the Beijing Party. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that I said these words precisely when Zhang Bojun was ambitious and thought he was going to come out to "clean up the mess." Here, I was adding to the chorus of the right-wing group.

Someone asked me, did you think at that time that there would be great chaos and a "Hungarian-Polish incident"? Looking back now, I did not have this idea at the time. I thought that perhaps some schools would have some trouble, but the situation would be easy to control. I even naively thought that it would be a good thing if the China Democratic League could assist the Party in quelling the unrest. I did not know at all that the Zhang-Luo group was planning to start fires and spread dissatisfaction everywhere, and on the other hand, they were using this opportunity to blackmail the Party and seize leadership. And I also thought that since this matter was to be reported to the Party's leadership, then the problem would be easily solved. So I didn't take it to heart at all, and early in the morning on June 9th, I ran to the Western Hills to write articles.

Upon examination, the reason why I made this series of mistakes is by no means accidental. First of all, I myself have serious bourgeois ideas. Due to my class origin and education in middle school and university, and later due to my long-term association with bourgeois intellectuals during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, my bourgeois ideas did not decrease but increased. After liberation, although I have made some progress in the past few years, it is undeniable that I still have serious bourgeois ideas in my mind. This is the first reason. Second, precisely because I have serious bourgeois ideas, coupled with the shortcomings of certain Party members in my work position, I have a lot of dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction slowly accumulated and turned into great dissatisfaction with the Party in that unit. This dissatisfaction was, of course, very welcome to the figures of the Zhang-Luo group. Third, since this spring, I mistakenly believed that the large-scale class struggle has basically ended, and that there are only ideological problems among intellectuals, and that ideological problems need to be solved over a long period of time. In addition, the core figures of the rightists often said to me, "We have almost reformed!" or "You support socialism, and I also support socialism. Everyone's political stance is consistent, and the problem is just that there are some differences in thinking. And thinking needs to be solved slowly." I didn't believe these words at first, but after listening to them many times, I slowly came to believe them. I completely did not understand that the question of who defeats whom on the ideological front had not yet been resolved, and that there was still a fierce class struggle in between. Because I had such a wrong understanding, I completely lost my sense of smell in the face of the Zhang-Luo group's conspiracy activities. In addition, I was out of touch with the masses in my life and had complacent emotions. In this way, I quickly fell into the mud pit of the rightists.

Recently, due to the exposure of the Zhang-Luo group's conspiracy, I have learned about their entire set of evil plans. I hate them, especially myself. But I will never lose courage because of this. Now I am willing to jump out of the mud pit, closely follow the Party, re-arm myself with the weapons of Marxism-Leninism, and fight to the end to completely smash the right-wing conspiracy group.

### 我的检讨  黄药眠的发言

    我的检讨
    黄药眠的发言
    我今天是以十分沉重的心情向大家发言的。在大会开始的时候，我还以为我在思想上犯了错误，后来我才知道是犯了严重的政治上的错误，是中国走资本主义道路还是走社会主义道路的最根本性的错误。
    过去，我曾以“进步”自封，但是自从五月初党的整风运动开始以来，我就完全暴露出了我丑恶的面貌。
    首先，我做了章罗集团所阴谋计划的四个临时工作组当中“有关学校领导体制”的召集人（根据章伯钧和浦熙修自己所坦白的材料，这个组的召集人，他们原来是预定要费孝通的，那时费孝通还没有回来，所以把我点上了）。五月十三号，我还召集了小型会议，而且还起草了“我们对学校领导体制问题的建议（草案初稿）”。在这个文件中尽管我批评了“党团退出学校”和“教授治校”的反社会主义的谬论，但这并不能掩饰这个文件本身也是反党的。比方我说“要加强党的领导，民主治校”，既然要加强党的领导，怎么又来一个“民主治校”？这岂不是把党的领导和民主对立起来了吗？这岂不是把加强党的领导变成空的，而“民主治校”才是真的吗？当然，这是很适合于章罗篡夺学校领导权的目的的。其次，在这个文件中，我强调党的政治思想的领导，而把党对学校的组织领导完全忽视了。党如果不掌握学校里的人事和财政权，那么它的领导岂不是没有了物质基础吗？我口头说，要加强党的领导，而实际恰好相反，正是要削弱党的领导。再其次，我一方面说，要以党委或党组作为领导的核心，而另外一方面又说校务委员会是最高的领导机构，这样一来，校长就变成了一个校务委员会的执行者，只有了民主而没有了集中。党组的领导核心也就很难体现。很明显，这些都是带有纲领性的错误。这个文件虽然是一个“草案”“初稿”，并没有发表，但我不敢隐瞒，现在已交广东小组转给常委，作为检查我的错误的材料。
    其次，我在向师范大学的领导提意见的时候，并没有根据团结的精神、协助党搞好工作的精神来提意见，而是对师大党的领导作了恶毒的进攻。我没有强调知识分子应该认真改造的一方面，反而强调了知识分子的进步的一面。同时我还错误地以为，资产阶级知识分子在学校里篡夺领导权在全国解放初期是可能的，但在现在，那就不可能了。理由是现在一切制度都已确立，一般的知识分子不愿意搞行政工作，而且现在做行政工作，又不像国民党时代可以借此升官发财等等。但我没有估计到，资产阶级知识分子尽管他自己个人可能没有攫取权位的野心，但他们总是企图以他自己的世界观来改造世界。对学校来说，也就是企图以资产阶级的方式来办学校。章罗事件证明：资产阶级的确怀有夺取学校领导权的野心，而我恰好在客观上做了他们的工具。关于我在六月五日师大中文系教职员座谈会上的发言，将来我要在师大中文系去检讨，这里不再详述了。
    第三，是我参加了六月六号章伯钧召集的文化俱乐部的集会。姑且不管六月五号章伯钧等的集会以及在六月六号章伯钧最初的发言我没有听到，但是就我自己的发言来说，也就够荒谬。比方我说一九五三年以后，党对非党的知识分子就不信任了。其实党对非党知识分子是很信任的。党对章伯钧罗隆基难道说不信任吗？问题是，他们不值得信任。而且一个知识分子，如果不肯认真改造，就是党信任了他，也是要出很大问题的。其次我说，“党对知识分子‘团结、教育、改造’的政策，在北京实际执行的是利用、限制、改造的政策。”也许在个别的机关，个别的党员有这样的现象，但我把它概括成为整个北京党的现象。这显然是对北京党的污蔑。问题的严重还在于我说这些话，是正当章伯钧野心勃勃认为要出来“收拾残局”的时候。这里，我正是加进了右派集团的合唱队。
    有人问我，你那个时候，是不是以为会天下大乱，会出现“波匈事件”？现在回忆起来，我当时的确没有这种想法。我想也许某一个学校会闹出一些事情，但局面是容易控制的。甚至我还天真地以为民盟能够协助党平息风潮，那也是一件好事。我完全不知道章罗集团一方面有计划地在到处点火，散布不满，而另一方面则又利用这个机会来向党讹诈，夺取领导。而且我还以为既然要把这件事情向党的领导方面反映，那么问题也就容易解决了。所以我完全不以此为意，六月九号一早，我就跑到西山去写文章去了。
    检查起来，我之所以会犯这一系列的错误，决不是偶然的。首先是我自己存在有严重的资产阶级思想。由于阶级出身和中学、大学里的教育，后来又由于在抗日战争时期、解放战争时期长期地和资产阶级知识分子搞在一起，这就使得我的资产阶级思想不是减少了而是增加了。解放后，这几年来，虽然有了若干进步，但不可否认，在我脑子里还有严重的资产阶级思想。这是第一个原因。第二，正由于我有严重的资产阶级思想，再加上我的工作岗位上的某些党员的缺点，这就使得我有很大的不满。这种不满慢慢积累起来就变成了对那个单位的党有很大的不满情绪。这种不满情绪，当然是为章罗集团的人物所十分欢迎的。第三，自从今年春间以来，我错误地以为，大规模的阶级斗争已基本结束，知识分子中间只存在有思想问题，而思想问题，是需要长期来解决的。加以右派的核心人物常常对我说，“我们改造到差不多啦！”或者说：“你拥护社会主义，我也拥护社会主义，大家的政治立场是一致的，问题不过是思想还有些差异罢了。而思想是要慢慢来解决的。”这些话，我最先不相信，但后来听多了也就慢慢相信了。我完全不了解在思想战线上谁战胜谁的问题还是没有解决，这中间还有强烈的阶级斗争。由于我有这样错误的理解，这就使得我在章罗集团的阴谋活动面前，完全失去了嗅觉。再加上我在生活上脱离群众，有骄傲自满的情绪，这样一来，我就很快堕入到右派的泥坑里去了。
    最近由于章罗集团的阴谋的揭发，我才了解到他们的整套的罪恶的计划。我痛恨他们，尤其痛恨我自己。但我决不因此就丧失勇气。现在我愿意从泥坑里跳出来，紧紧地跟在党的后面，重新拿起马列主义的武器，为彻底粉碎右派的阴谋集团而奋斗到底。
