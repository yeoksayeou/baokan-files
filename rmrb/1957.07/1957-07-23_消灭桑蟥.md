Eliminate the Silkworm Moth

(Our newspaper dispatch) Jiaxing Prefecture is a nationally renowned silkworm breeding base and a key silkworm producing area in the province. This year, the entire prefecture suffered a loss of over 55,000 silkworm rearing sheets due to a shortage of mulberry leaves, which is a significant setback.

Why has the mulberry leaf production decreased? The main reasons are: the contradiction between grain production and mulberry cultivation has not been properly resolved, management has not kept pace in a timely manner, and natural disasters have had an impact. Currently, out of the 1.1 million mu of mulberry orchards in the prefecture, more than 400,000 mu are severely affected by silkworm moth infestations. In key silkworm producing counties such as Wuxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, and Deqing, silkworm moth infestations have spread to over 80% of the total area of mulberry orchards, and the problem occurs every year. This not only seriously threatens the lifespan of mulberry trees and affects the increase in spring leaf production, but also prevents the entire prefecture from increasing its autumn silkworm rearing volume. According to relevant estimates, the annual loss of autumn cocoons due to silkworm moth infestation is approximately 50,000 dan or more.

The Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office have decided to seize the favorable opportunity of the first generation of silkworm moths just hatching to launch a concentrated campaign to control the moths in the key infested areas of Wuxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, and Deqing counties. To ensure the smooth progress of the moth control campaign, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already issued instructions on moth control. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to allocate 4,800 sprayers to the key moth control areas.

The Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has already studied the principles for resolving the contradiction between grain and mulberry production. The issue of strengthening the management of mulberry orchards is also under study.

    消灭桑蟥
    本报讯　嘉兴专区是全国闻名的蚕丝基地，也是全省的重点蚕区。今年全区因缺少桑叶倒蚕五万五千多张，这是一件重大的损失。
    桑叶为什么减产呢？主要原因是：粮桑之间的矛盾没有妥善解决，经营管理没有及时跟上，以及自然灾害的影响。目前全区一百一十万亩桑园中，有四十多万亩受到桑蟥的严重为害；重点蚕区吴兴、崇德、桐乡、德清等县桑蟥为害已蔓延到桑园总面积80％以上，而且年年成灾。这不但严重威胁桑树寿命与影响春叶增产，而且使全区秋蚕饲养量不能增加。据有关方面估计，每年因桑蟥为害损失秋茧约在五万担以上。
    中共嘉兴地委与专署决定抓住当前头蟥刚孵化的有利时机，在吴兴、崇德、桐乡、德清四个县的重点蟥区开展突击治蟥运动。为了使治蟥运动正常开展，中共嘉兴地委已经发布了治蟥指示；省农业厅，决定拨给治蟥重点区喷雾器四千八百架。
    对粮桑矛盾问题，中共嘉兴地委已经研究了解决原则；关于加强桑园经营管理问题，也正在研究中。
