Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 20th. A gathering was held in Delhi on the evening of July 19th to celebrate the third anniversary of the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India regarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The celebration was organized by the Delhi India-China Friendship Association.

The joint statement by the Prime Ministers of China and India was issued in Delhi on June 28, 1954.

Mr. Sundarlal, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, who presided over the celebration, said that today Panchsheel is universally understood throughout the world, and it is an important common tool for striving for lasting peace. Differences in ideology do not hinder Panchsheel. He said that this common bond between India and China—Panchsheel—will be further developed and strengthened.

Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili delivered a congratulatory speech, saying that China and India's joint adherence to the principles of Panchsheel has further strengthened and developed their friendship in the past few years. He believes that under the guidance of the Five Principles, the people of the two countries will achieve greater success in their common cause of safeguarding peace.

Ambassador Pan Zili said that China's foreign policy is fully in line with the Five Principles and the Bandung Spirit. China is willing to maintain and develop peaceful and friendly relations with all countries that treat China in the same spirit and principles.

Many members of parliament and social celebrities attended the meeting. Speakers included Member of Parliament Yanik, renowned historian Dr. Ashraf, veteran Member of Parliament Pratap, journalist Singh, and Member of Parliament Ranga. Most of the speakers attacked colonialism, saying that it was contrary to the five principles of peace. They criticized military treaties and the Eisenhower Doctrine, and condemned imperialists for interfering in the affairs of China, Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, Algeria, and other Middle Eastern countries. They demanded that world public opinion widely publicize Panchsheel.
