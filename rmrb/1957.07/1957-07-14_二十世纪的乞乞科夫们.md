    Twentieth-Century Chichikovs
    In Gogol's famous novel "Dead Souls," after recounting the story of Chichikov buying up lists of dead people to use as capital for swindling, the author wrote: "We already know that Chichikov was very worried about his descendants."
    However, Chichikov worried in vain, because his "descendants" are even more accomplished than he was in this line of work. However, they have mainly moved across the ocean. There, people can still easily encounter them. For example, during every American election year, one can always find Chichikovs at work. They quietly search for names in cemeteries, and can get a batch of "voters" for the Republican or Democratic parties without spending a penny. This ability alone is enough to make the old Chichikov feel ashamed. But recently they have put on even more astonishing performances.
    On July 8th, the gentlemen of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee copied down the names of four hundred and fifty American soldiers from the Korean War death list and made a big fuss in the Capitol; the next day, they even passed a resolution with great fanfare condemning the People's Republic of China for refusing to account for the "whereabouts" of these people. It is not difficult for discerning people to see that the activities of this batch of modern Chichikovs are directly related to the recent U.S. open violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. They want to use a list of "dead souls" to divert people's attention. According to a report by the United Press, they even wanted to take this list of "dead souls" to the Sino-American negotiation table in Geneva to "strengthen Johnson's hand in the negotiations."
    Unfortunately, the Chichikovs in the U.S. House of Representatives were a bit too careless when playing this trick, and forgot to consult with the U.S. Department of Defense and propaganda agencies. Just as they were shouting for "Communist China to explain the whereabouts of these people," the United Press admitted that the U.S. Department of Defense had long since ascertained the whereabouts of "these people" and had "already paid death benefits to their families." Like their ancestor, Washington's new Chichikovs were exposed on the spot. (Ping)

### 二十世纪的乞乞科夫们

    二十世纪的乞乞科夫们
    在果戈理的名著“死魂灵”里，作者在叙述了乞乞科夫收买死人名单来做行骗资本的故事之后写道：“我们已经知道，乞乞科夫是很担心着他的后代的。”
    但是，乞乞科夫白担了心，因为他的“后代”，在这一门行当里，比他有过而无不及。不过他们已经主要迁到了大洋彼岸。在那里人们仍极容易碰到他们。比如，每届美国的大选年，人们总会发现乞乞科夫们在活动。他们不声不响地在墓园里找名字，不花一文就可以给共和党或民主党拉到一批“选民”。这种本领已足以使老乞乞科夫自愧不如了。但最近他们还做出了更惊人的表演。
    7月8日，美国众议院外交委员会的先生们从朝鲜战争的死亡名单里抄下四百五十个美国军人的名字，拿到国会厅大吵大嚷；第二天并且煞有介事地通过一个决议，谴责中华人民共和国拒绝交代这些人的“下落”。明眼人不难看出，这批现代乞乞科夫的活动，同最近美国公然破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为直接有关。他们想用一份“死魂灵”名单来转移一下人们的注意力。据合众社透露，他们甚至还想要把这份“死魂灵”名单拿到日内瓦的中美谈判桌上去，以“加强约翰逊在谈判中的力量”。
    可惜的是，美国众议院的乞乞科夫们耍这场把戏的时候未免太粗心一点，忘记了同美国国防部和宣传机关打一个招呼。正当他们在喊叫要“共产党中国说明这些人的下落”的时候，合众社承认，美国国防部早就已查明“这些人”的下落，而且“已经给他们的家属发了死亡抚恤金”。像他们的祖先一样，华盛顿的新乞乞科夫们也当场出丑了。（平）
