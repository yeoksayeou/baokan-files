Hungarian youth began preparations for participating in the World Youth Festival immediately after the establishment of the Hungarian Communist Youth League in March of this year. Now, the preparations have been largely completed.

Youth Representatives Defending the Fruits of the Revolution

Hungary will have a delegation of 1,000 youth participating in the festival, including 210 in the arts troupe and 190 in the sports team. The delegation members include outstanding youth from all walks of life. The delegation has particularly invited youths who bravely defended the socialist achievements during the October counter-revolutionary riots. The team uniforms are beautiful and elegant: men wear light gray pants, light gray shoes, and white nylon shirts; women wear light gray skirts, light gray shoes, and light blue shirts, with the new national emblem of the Republic inlaid in the upper left corner of the shirt.

The Hungarian Communist Youth League established a festival organizing committee to do a good job in preparing for the festival.

Excellent Cultural and Artistic Programs

Over the past few months, the organizing committee has continuously launched poster, photography, music, and sports competitions for participation in the Moscow festival. The winners of the competitions will bring their creations to the festival. The arts troupe is rich and diverse, including the Petőfi Band, choirs, and a children's band. The children's band is particularly wonderful, with the band conductor only nine years old. Most of the songs played by the band are Hungarian folk songs and gypsy music. A fourteen-year-old girl, known as a genius magician, will also participate in this performance.

Youth in the film industry will bring the films "The Merry-Go-Round" and "This is How it Happened" to Moscow. The film "This is How it Happened" is a documentary about the October counter-revolutionary events. Hungarian youth will prove the truth about the October counter-revolution in Hungary to peace-loving youth around the world. In addition, the delegation will also bring a lot of evidence and documents related to the counter-revolutionary events.

In sports, a series of round-robin ball games and other competitions have already been launched nationwide. Hungarian national champions, world champions, and Olympic athletes will also participate in the various sports competitions held at this year's Moscow Festival.

Gifts for the Labor Competition

Hungarian youth have launched a warm labor competition nationwide to celebrate the festival. Coal miners have formed youth teams and use Sundays for voluntary labor. Half of the coal price is donated to the festival as a fund, and the other half is used for local youth activities. For example, the youth of Erberold have donated 12,000 forints. The young workers of the Red Csepel and Angel districts of Budapest specially made motorcycles using saved materials during their rest time as gifts for the festival. The cutting machine that Csepel youth bravely defended during the October counter-revolution will also be a precious gift to the Soviet youth participating in the Moscow Festival. The Szekesfehervar Radio Factory has not produced any defective products in the two months since the labor competition was launched.

Rural farmers have also launched labor competitions. For example, the youth in Baranya County organized two harvesting teams, and the Gyor County organized ten harvesting teams, to accelerate wheat harvesting. The youth of Borsod County specially issued commemorative festival stamps to raise funds for the festival.

Workers and farmers in factories and farms across the country are actively preparing various gifts with their skillful hands. These gifts are all exquisite local specialties, such as sea-blue porcelain and wine barrels from Kecskemét. These wine barrels are made with special sophistication, with one barrel able to hold three different types of wine without mixing.

Peace and Friendship Get-Togethers

To date, youth in 150 regions of Hungary have held "Peace and Friendship" get-togethers to celebrate the Youth Festival. Some large-scale get-togethers have also invited Soviet youth and Chinese students to participate. Youth in the 6th District of Budapest held a torchlight parade earlier this month.

### 匈牙利青年积极准备参加联欢节

    匈牙利青年积极准备参加联欢节
    匈牙利在今年3月成立了匈牙利共产主义青年团后，马上就开始了参加世界青年联欢节的筹备工作。现在筹备工作已大部完成。
    保卫革命果实的青年代表
    匈牙利青年将有一千人的代表团参加联欢节，艺术队有二百一十人，体育队有一百九十人。代表团成员包括社会各阶层优秀青年。代表团特别邀请了在十月反革命暴乱中英勇保卫社会主义成果的青年们。代表队队服美丽、大方，男的穿着浅灰色裤子、浅灰色鞋、白色尼龙衬衣，女的穿着浅灰色裙子、浅灰色鞋、浅蓝色衬衣，在衬衣的左上角镶着共和国新国徽。
    匈牙利共产主义青年团为了做好联欢节筹备工作，特别成立了联欢节筹委会。
    出色的文艺节目
    筹委会在几个月来连续发起了参加莫斯科联欢节的招贴画、摄影、音乐和各项体育比赛，比赛中得胜者将带着自己的创作参加联欢节。文艺大队丰富多彩，有裴多菲乐队、合唱团、儿童乐队。儿童乐队特别精彩，乐队指挥只有九岁。乐队演奏的歌曲大部是匈牙利的民歌和吉卜赛乐曲。这次参加演出的还有一位十四岁的小姑娘，她被称为天才的魔术家。
    电影界的青年将带着影片“转盘秋千”和“是这样发生的”到莫斯科去，影片“是这样发生的”是一部关于十月反革命事件的纪录片，匈牙利青年们将要在全世界爱好和平的青年面前证实匈牙利十月反革命的真相。此外，代表团还要带去很多有关反革命事件的证据和文件。
    体育方面，早已在全国范围内掀起了一系列的循环球赛和其他各项比赛。匈牙利全国冠军、世界冠军、奥林匹克选手们也要参加今年莫斯科联欢节举行的各项体育比赛。
    劳动竞赛的献礼
    匈牙利青年为祝贺联欢节在全国范围内掀起了热烈的劳动竞赛。煤矿工人成立了青年小组，利用星期日做义务劳动。煤价的一半献给联欢节作基金，另一半做本地青年联欢用，如扼尔伯路德的青年已献出一万二千福林。布达佩斯红色切佩尔和安琪尔地区的青年工人把利用休息时间用节约出来的原料特制的摩托车作为联欢节献礼。切佩尔青年工人在十月反革命时期英勇保卫住的切削机，也将是他们送给参加莫斯科联欢节苏联青年的珍贵礼品。塞克斯腓赫发城无线电工厂自从发起劳动竞赛后二个月来没有出产废品。
    乡村农民也发起了劳动竞赛，如巴兰尼亚州青年组织了两个收割小组，吉厄尔州组织了十个收割小组，以加速收割小麦。包尔绍德州青年为了筹备联欢节资金，特别发行了联欢节纪念邮票。
    全国各地的工厂、农场的工人、农民用他们灵巧的双手正在积极准备各种不同的礼物。这些礼物都是当地精致的特产，如海蓝的瓷器，刻斯克美特的酒桶。这种酒桶制造得特别精致，一个酒桶可装三种不同的酒，但不混合。
    和平友谊联欢
    匈牙利各州青年至今已有一百五十个地区为庆祝青年联欢节举行了“和平友谊”联欢。有些大规模的联欢会上还邀请了苏联青年和中国留学生参加。布达佩斯第六区的青年曾在本月初举行火炬游行。
