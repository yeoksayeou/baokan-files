In his speech, Guan Baojia said: Without the leadership of the Communist Party, our minority nationalities would not achieve equality and unity, and would not live a happy life; therefore, we cannot leave the leadership of the Communist Party for a moment.

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou and the central comrades, and I will resolutely work hard to implement them in future work.

Since liberation, the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the higher-level People's Government, has undergone significant changes and development in politics, economy, culture, education and other aspects. Before liberation, the people who were oppressed, exploited, and treated worse than animals have become masters of their own affairs after liberation and have the right to manage their own internal affairs; before liberation, there was mutual killing and deep division between the nationalities, but after liberation, a new relationship of close unity, mutual assistance and fraternal love has been established; before liberation, the economy was poor, and the working people lived a painful life of hunger and cold, but since liberation, agricultural and pastoral production has developed, the lives of the broad masses have improved, and a thriving new atmosphere is everywhere; before liberation, culture and education were backward, and there were many diseases, but since liberation, the development of the national languages has been promoted, and schools have been vigorously built, with the number of children enrolled being many times higher than before liberation. Due to the establishment of health institutions and the implementation of prevention and treatment work, various diseases have been greatly reduced. From the production perspective, the scattered and backward individual small-scale agricultural economy and animal husbandry economy have begun to move towards advanced mutual aid and cooperation, and large-scale collective labor production. By the end of 1956, small agricultural areas had basically achieved cooperativization, and the superiority of cooperativization had been brought into play. Pastoral production cooperatives have been established on a trial basis in pastoral areas, and they have similarly demonstrated the superiority of cooperativization. For example, the Hongxing Pastoral Production Cooperative of Taiji'ai Banner in Dulan County was established in February 1956. The entire cooperative had 15 households, 50 people, and a total of 1,681 heads of livestock contributed as shares. After the establishment of the cooperative, due to the superiority of collective labor which individual farming could not match, and the diligence and hard work of the members, production increased greatly. In that year, the total income of the cooperative from pastoral and agricultural activities was 12,800 yuan in RMB. After deducting the production investment, and retaining 1.5% for the public accumulation fund and 0.5% for the public welfare fund, the actual distribution to the members reached more than 11,400 yuan, which was a 44% increase compared to the total income of 8,699 yuan earned by all members from individual farming in 1955. The establishment of the Hongxing Pastoral Production Cooperative, especially the concrete facts of profit distribution, educated the broad masses of herdsmen, making them see with their own eyes that riding horses, eating meat, chanting scriptures, and giving alms were all free in the cooperative; joining the cooperative would not only not reduce production or affect income, but would instead develop production and increase income; joining the cooperative did not mean giving the livestock to others, but rather owning more livestock on a public basis. As a result, they recognized the benefits of taking the socialist road, and greatly eliminated the previous concerns of "fear of division and fear of struggle". The members within the cooperative loved the cooperative even more, and the herdsmen who had not yet joined also raised their awareness of taking the socialist road.

Developing animal husbandry production can supply light industry with a large amount of production raw materials, supply agriculture with a large number of draught animals, support the development of light industry and agriculture, and gradually meet the needs of urban residents for meat. Of course, the development of industry and agriculture will in turn promote and drive the development of animal husbandry production, and the three are mutually supportive and interconnected. Precisely because of this, the Party and the People's Government have always attached great importance to the development of animal husbandry production. Since liberation, in order to support the continuous development of the animal husbandry economy, the Party and the People's Government have issued large amounts of loans and relief funds to the herdsmen, carried out livestock disease prevention and control work, and educated the herdsmen to gradually improve feeding and management methods. The existing livestock in our Haixi Mongol, Tibetan and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has exceeded one and a half times the original number of livestock before liberation, so the rapid development we have achieved is precisely due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and the adoption of the above-mentioned effective measures. Of course, it is also inseparable from the hard work of the broad masses of herdsmen. Here, I would like to raise a question: With the rapid development of livestock, the demand for pasture is also increasing. Now, some areas already feel that there is not enough grassland available. Therefore, strengthening grassland management and rationally using grassland to increase the carrying capacity of grassland has become an important issue in the current development of animal husbandry production. In the future, we should pay attention to constantly summarizing and accumulating experience, and conducting investigations and research in this regard. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the fact that when planning to reclaim wasteland or immigrate to pastoral areas in the future, we should consider the issue of livestock grazing, so as to both develop agricultural production and be conducive to the development of animal husbandry production.

The Qaidam Basin is rich in mineral resources, and can be said to be a treasure house of our country. However, this area was not valued during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, in order to realize China's socialist industrialization, the Party and the People's Government have invested a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources in the Qaidam area since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan to carry out resource exploration work. According to the materials explored in recent years, the Qaidam Basin has broad development prospects in terms of industrial construction. Due to the increasing development of resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin, it has also promoted the development of local agricultural and pastoral production, and the development of transportation. This has already had a major impact on improving the material and cultural life of the Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh people in the Haixi area. Now, the workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific personnel, troops, party and government cadres and other departments working in the Qaidam Basin are continuing to work hard on different posts and are conducting arduous struggles with nature. They need continued support from all parts of the country in various aspects. The people of all ethnic groups in our Haixi area have made great efforts in supporting the work in Qaidam in the past. In order to build a happy and harmonious family for all ethnic groups and to build a new Qinghai, we will make even greater efforts in the future.

Since liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government have done many good things for the people of all ethnic groups in China. The ironclad facts prove that the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government is correct, and the achievements are the main aspect and are very great. There are also shortcomings and problems in the work, but they are not the main aspect. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, our minority nationalities would not achieve equality and unity, and would not live a happy life, therefore, we cannot leave the leadership of the Communist Party for a moment. Today, some right-wing elements are actually closing their eyes and telling lies, denying that the leadership of the Communist Party is correct, obliterating the achievements, exaggerating the shortcomings, in order to undermine the close relationship between the Party and the people of all ethnic groups, and attempting to fish in troubled waters, overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and lead China back to the capitalist road, in order to achieve their personal conspiracy to get promoted and make a fortune. We want to solemnly warn the right-wing elements that the eyes of the people are sharp, and your conspiracy will absolutely not succeed. The people want to move forward on the socialist road, and the right-wing elements want to pull the people back to the capitalist road; the people need the leadership of the Communist Party, and the right-wing elements conspire to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. The reactionary thoughts and words of the right-wing elements are intolerable. The right-wing elements should turn back quickly and fall to the side of the people, and do not be obsessed, otherwise, the future is unimaginable. The people of all ethnic groups and all circles in the country must raise their vigilance in the future, and strictly prevent the conspiratorial activities of the right-wing elements, so as to ensure that our people of all ethnic groups can closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and continue to move forward on the only correct and bright road of socialism!

    海西自治州到处呈现新气象
    官保加在发言中说：没有共产党的领导，我们少数民族就得不到平等团结，过不上幸福的生活；因此，我们一时一刻也离不开共产党的领导。
    我完全同意周总理及中央各位负责同志的报告，并坚决在今后工作中努力实现。
    解放以来，青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州，由于中国共产党和上级人民政府的正确领导，在政治、经济、文化教育等各方面，都有显著的变化和发展。解放前，长期被压迫、被剥削、牛马不如的人，解放后当家作主，有了管理本民族内部事务的权利；解放前，各民族间互相仇杀，隔阂很深，解放后建立起了亲密团结、互助友爱的新关系；解放前，经济穷困，劳动人民过着饥寒交迫的痛苦生活，解放以来，牧、农业生产发展了，广大群众生活都有改善，到处呈现出欣欣向荣的新气象；解放前，文化教育落后，疾病很多，解放以来，提倡发展本民族的文字，大力兴建学校，现有的入学儿童比解放前增加了好多倍，由于卫生机构的建立和预防治疗工作的开展，各种疾病大大地减少了。从生产方面来说，分散、落后的个体小农经济和畜牧业经济，已开始走向先进的互助合作、集体劳动的大生产。迄至一九五六年底，小块农业区，已基本合作化，并且发挥了合作化的优越性。在牧业区已试办了牧业生产合作社，它同样的显示了合作化的优越性。如都兰县台吉爱旗红星牧业生产合作社，是一九五六年二月间组成的，全社有社员十五户，五十人，计头折股入社牲畜共一千六百八十一头。建社后，由于集体劳动具有单干所不能及的优越性，和社员的勤俭努力，增产很大，当年全社牧、农业收入折合人民币一万二千八百元，除去生产投资部分，并留出公积金百分之一点五、公益金百分之零点五外，实分给社员的达一万一千四百余元，比全体社员在一九五五年单干的总收入八千六百九十九元，增加了百分之四十四。红星牧业生产合作社的建立，特别是分红的具体事实，教育了广大牧民群众，使他们亲眼看到合作社里骑马、吃肉、念经、化布施等，都是自由的；参加合作社不但不会减产，影响收入；相反的是发展了生产，增加了收入；参加合作社不是把牲畜分给别人了，而是在公有的基础上占有的牲畜更多了，因而认识到走社会主义道路的好处，大大地消除了以前“怕分、怕斗”的顾虑。在社内的社员更加爱社了，还未入社的牧民，也提高了走社会主义道路的觉悟。
    发展畜牧业生产，可以供给轻工业大批的生产原料，供给农业大批的役畜，支援轻工业和农业的发展，并可逐步满足城市居民对于肉食的需要。当然，工业、农业的发展，又会促进和带动畜牧业生产的发展，三者是互相支援、互相关联的。正因为如此，党和人民政府对发展畜牧业生产，一向是很重视的。解放以来，党和人民政府为了扶助畜牧业经济的不断发展，给牧民群众发放了大批的贷款和救济款，开展了畜疫防治工作，教育牧民群众逐步改进了饲放管理方法。我们海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州，现有的牲畜已超过解放前原有牲畜数的一倍半以上，所以能获得这样迅速发展的成绩，正是由于有中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，采取了上述有效措施的结果，当然，也是和广大牧民群众的辛勤劳动分不开的。这里我顺便提出一个问题：随着牲畜的迅速发展，对于牧草的需要量也就日益增长了。现在，个别地区已有草原不够使用的感觉。因此，加强草原管理，合理使用草原，以提高草原载畜量，就成为当前发展畜牧业生产的一个重要问题。今后我们在这方面，要注意不断地总结积累经验，进行调查研究。同时，我们还应该注意，以后在计划开垦荒地或向牧区移民时，应该考虑到牲畜吃草问题，要做到既能发展农业生产，又有利于发展畜牧业生产。
    柴达木盆地，矿藏丰富，可以说是我国的一个宝库。但是，这个地区在国民党反动统治时期，是不被重视的。解放后，党和人民政府为了实现我国社会主义工业化，在实施第一个五年计划以来，就在柴达木地区投入了很大的人力、物力和财力，进行资源勘探工作。根据几年来勘探的材料证明，柴达木盆地在工业建设方面是有远大发展前途的。由于柴达木盆地资源勘探工作的日益发展，也推动了当地农、牧业生产的发展，交通运输事业的发展，这对于改善海西地区蒙、藏、哈萨克族人民的物质文化生活，都已经发生了重大的作用。现在，在柴达木盆地工作的工人、工程技术人员、科学人员、部队、党政及其他各部门的干部，都正在不同的岗位上，继续努力和自然界进行着艰苦的斗争，他们需要全国各地继续在各个方面予以支援。我们海西地区的各族人民，过去在支援柴达木工作上，尽了很大的努力，为了建设各族人民美满幸福的大家庭，为了建设新青海，我们今后还要作更大的努力。
    共产党和人民政府，解放以来，给中国各族人民办了许多好事。铁的事实证明共产党和人民政府的领导是正确的，成绩是主要的、很大的。工作中也有缺点和问题，但不是主要的。没有共产党的领导，我们少数民族就得不到平等团结，过不上幸福的生活，因此，我们一时一刻也离不开共产党的领导。今天竟然有些右派分子，闭着眼睛说瞎话，否认共产党的领导是正确的，抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，借以破坏党和各族人民群众的亲密关系，企图混水摸鱼，推翻共产党的领导，把中国引向资本主义道路后退，以达到实现其个人升官发财的阴谋。我们要正告右派分子，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，你们这种阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。人民要踏着社会主义道路前进，右派分子要把人民拉向资本主义道路后退，人民需要共产党领导，右派分子阴谋推翻共产党的领导，右派分子这种反动的思想言论，是不能容忍的。右派分子应该快些回头，向人民这边倒，不要执迷不悟，否则，前途是不可设想的。全国各族各界人民，今后还要提高警惕，严防右派分子的阴谋活动，以保证我们各族人民，能够紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，踏着社会主义这条唯一正确的光明大道，不断地前进、再前进！
