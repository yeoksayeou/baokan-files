The Indian Ambassador expressed his pleasure at the presence of the Soviet leaders at the banquet. He said that the Soviet leaders are sincerely concerned about the Bandung Conference, and the relations between the Soviet Union and each country participating in the Bandung Conference are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence clearly defined at Bandung.

    King Zahir Shah pointed out in his speech that the family of Bandung Conference countries is beneficial and effective, and that the colonialists, despite all their efforts, cannot destroy the great spirit of Eastern solidarity. In referring to the relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, he said that the relations between the two countries have been based on friendship and good neighborliness from the very beginning, and remain so to this day.

    Egyptian Ambassador Kunni also spoke at the meeting. He expressed gratitude for the support given by Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union to Egypt in resisting aggression last year. He said that the people of Asian and African countries can count on the valuable friendship and support of the Soviet Union in their efforts to fight for freedom and peace.
