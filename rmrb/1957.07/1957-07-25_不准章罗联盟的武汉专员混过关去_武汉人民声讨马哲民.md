Don't Let the Zhang-Luo Alliance's Wuhan Commissioner Get Away With It
Wuhan People Denounce Ma Zhemin
(Our Newspaper's Report) Ma Zhemin, the Wuhan "Commissioner" of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, returned to Wuhan on the 21st.

When Ma Zhemin attended the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress in Beijing, he resolutely refused to admit the facts of everyone exposing his crimes of faithfully carrying out the evil plans of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. After the closing of the conference, he used the excuse of "difficult-to-buy train tickets" to hide in Beijing, refusing to return to explain his crimes to the people of Hubei. After the Hubei China Democratic League organization sent a telegram urging him to return, he reluctantly agreed to return to Wuhan.

Now, the members of the Hubei China Democratic League and all the faculty, staff, and students of the Central South University of Finance and Economics (Ma Zhemin is the chairman of the Hubei China Democratic League and the president of the Central South University of Finance and Economics) have formed a powerful lineup to struggle against the Ma Zhemin right-wing group, preparing to completely smash this stronghold of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Wuhan. On the morning of the 16th, the Hubei Provincial Committee branch of the China Democratic League convened a general meeting of all cadres. Those attending the meeting believed that Ma Zhemin's sophistry only exposed his ugly face of attempting to resist to the end. The faculty, staff, and students of the Central South University of Finance and Economics are preparing to launch a struggle to counterattack this right-wing leader. More than seventy battle newspapers throughout the university worked day and night to produce 1,650 big-character posters, 224 cartoons, and 48 special issues, turning the wide campus into a solemn battleground for counterattacking Ma Zhemin. On many big-character posters, people hope that Ma Zhemin will pull back from the brink and not cut himself off from the people. Li Da, Li Dongqing, and Nie Guoqing, representatives who had recently returned from attending the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, revealed to newspaper reporters Ma Zhemin's behavior of sophistry and耍赖(playing the rascal) during the meeting in Beijing. In recent days, the Hubei Daily and the Yangtze River Daily have published many articles, letters, poems, and cartoons exposing and criticizing Ma Zhemin's reactionary remarks and deeds.

According to the Hubei Daily and Yangtze River Daily on the 22nd, when Ma Zhemin returned to Wuhan on the 21st and met with representatives of the Central South University of Finance and Economics' journal and more than sixty big-character posters, he still showed no sign of repentance. He described his anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal acts as "liberalism" and did not honestly explain his relationship with the Zhang-Luo Alliance. The struggle of all sectors in Hubei to counterattack this right-wing element is continuing to deepen.

### 不准章罗联盟的武汉专员混过关去  武汉人民声讨马哲民

    不准章罗联盟的武汉专员混过关去
    武汉人民声讨马哲民
    本报讯　章罗联盟驻武汉“专员”马哲民，于21日回到武汉。
    马哲民在北京出席人民代表大会第四次会议的时候，坚决不承认大家揭发他忠实执行章罗联盟的罪恶计划的事实。在大会闭幕后，他借口“车票难买”而躲在北京，不肯回去向湖北人民交代自己的罪行。经过湖北民盟组织打电报催促，他才勉强答应回到武汉。
    现在，湖北民盟盟员和中南财经学院的全体师生员工（马哲民是湖北民盟的主任委员和中南财经学院院长），组成了向马哲民右派集团进行斗争的强大阵容，准备彻底粉碎章罗联盟在武汉的这个据点。16日上午，民盟湖北省委机关支部召开了全体干部大会，出席会议的人认为马哲民的狡辩，只是暴露了他企图顽抗到底的丑恶面目。中南财经学院的师生员工正在准备投入迎击这个右派头领的斗争。全院七十多个战斗报刊，夜以继日地赶制了一千六百五十张大字报，二百二十四幅漫画，四十八个专刊，把一个宽阔的校院，布成了一座严正的反攻马哲民的阵地。在许多大字报上，人们都希望马哲民悬崖勒马，不要自绝于人民。回来不久的出席全国人民代表大会第四次会议的代表李达、李冬青、聂国青，向报纸记者揭露了马哲民在北京开会时的狡辩耍赖的行为。连日以来，湖北日报和长江日报登载了许多揭露和批判马哲民反动言行的文章、来信、诗歌和漫画。
    据22日的湖北日报、长江日报载，马哲民21日回到武汉接见中南财经学院院刊和六十多个大字报的记者代表时，仍没有悔过自新的表示，他把反党反社会主义的罪恶言行说成是“自由主义”，也没有老实交代他同章罗联盟关系的表现。湖北各界反击这个右派分子的斗争，正在进一步深入展开。
