All Are "Zhongshan Wolves"!

      Deng Chumin: Denounces right-wing intellectuals for repaying kindness with ingratitude towards the Communist Party, and warns them to thoroughly repent, turn their wolf hearts into human hearts, and bow before truth and the people.
    Please allow me not to repeat at the outset what the representatives I agree with have said. We are people's representatives, and we must represent the will of the people. We demand what the people demand; we oppose what the people oppose. Otherwise, we are fundamentally unworthy of being people's representatives. Unexpectedly, among the representatives of the National People's Congress, before and after this rectification campaign, quite a few bourgeois right-wing elements and right-wing ringleaders have been prominently exposed. These people are fundamentally unworthy of being people's representatives. I want to, on behalf of the people of the whole country, lodge a complaint with the congress against all the bourgeois right-wing elements among the people's representatives, and suggest that the congress make resolutions based on the severity of the circumstances, and have their original electoral units revoke their representative qualifications; those who hold positions in state organs (such as ministers and vice ministers of the State Council, governors and mayors, vice governors and vice mayors of provinces and cities, presidents, deans, and vice presidents of universities, etc.) should also have the State Council revoke their positions based on the severity of the circumstances, by resolutions made by the congress.

    Are we being excessive in dealing with the right-wing elements among the people's representatives in this way? I think it is not excessive at all. Look at the right-wing ringleaders, some basically represent landlords and rich peasants, such as Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, etc.; some represent backward elements of the bourgeoisie, such as Zhang Naiqi, Bi Mingqi, etc.; some represent backward intellectuals of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc. Although the class components they represent are different, their goal is the same, that is, to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, and others put on a look of compassion, saying that the lives of the peasants are bitter, saying that there are deviations in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, emphasizing shortcomings and obliterating achievements, describing the new China as completely dark. In this group discussion and general assembly discussion, many people's representatives, especially worker and peasant representatives, contrasted the lives of workers and peasants in the new China with those in the old China, and strongly condemned their vicious attacks on the Party and the People's Government. In fact, Huang Shaohong once held military and political power in Guangxi and Zhejiang provinces in the old China. Please let him recall what the lives of the peasants in Guangxi and Zhejiang provinces were like at that time? What were the lives of all the people like? It can truly be said that the countryside was bankrupt and the cities were desolate. In order to maintain his bloody rule, he even slaughtered innocent people, especially revolutionary elements and progressive people. Representatives from Zhejiang and Guangxi have already exposed his various crimes. Long Yun ruled Yunnan for more than ten years, and was about the same as Huang Shaohong, but one point he may be better than Huang Shaohong is that he developed production in Yunnan - the production of opium, which poisons the people!

    Zhang Naiqi, Bi Mingqi, and others, especially Zhang Naiqi, do not seem to be comparable to Huang Shaohong and Long Yun. In the old China, he regarded himself as a progressive, but the Gui warlords also promoted him to be the director of the finance department; in the new China, the Party trusted him and invited him to be the Minister of Food. Of course, he still regards himself as a progressive! Moreover, he thinks that he is more progressive than the working class, that his theoretical level is higher than the level of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it seems that the real Marxism-Leninism is to say that the bourgeoisie today has no two sides, and that it is dogmatism to say that the bourgeoisie today still has two sides. I think he is neither Marxism-Leninism, nor can he be said to be dogmatism, but precisely anti-Party and anti-socialist capitalism. He did not deny this point himself. He said that "capitalism has good and bad", which is equivalent to saying that he sincerely supports good capitalism. But his anti-Party and anti-socialist essence has never been admitted. To ask Zhang Naiqi to admit his anti-Party and anti-socialist true essence is like asking the reactionary ruling class in history to step down automatically, which is impossible. Zhang Naiqi cannot admit his anti-Party and anti-socialist essence, and the people and the majority of progressive bourgeoisie cannot allow Zhang Naiqi not to admit his anti-Party and anti-socialist essence. In this way, Zhang Naiqi is not a progressive, but a backward element; not only a backward element, but also an isolated element. The world is so big that there will be no place for him to stand, or he may only be able to hide temporarily in his small pipe that he always has in his mouth.

    Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others seem to be neither comparable to Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, and others, nor comparable to Zhang Naiqi, Bi Mingqi, and others. They have greater ambitions, formed the Zhang-Luo alliance, and wanted to engage in "political design institutes" and "rehabilitation committees." They used the organizational components of the Democratic League, which are mainly intellectuals, the cultural and educational circles, and used their leading positions in the Democratic League. So they reached out to grab newspapers, grab schools, grab so-called scientists, grab backward intellectuals, grab counter-revolutionary elements who had committed counter-revolutionary crimes and were leniently treated by the government (including counter-revolutionary elements among intellectuals), especially grabbing the Democratic League's local organizations at all levels. Over the past few years, they have grabbed some people. Looking at the bourgeois right-wing elements exposed in this rectification movement, the Democratic League can be regarded as the commander, as far as the democratic parties are concerned, which can prove it. According to the Democratic League right-wing elements revealed in the central government, there are the well-known six professors and others. In Tianjin, there is Wang Dachuan, in Shanghai, there are Chen Renbing and Peng Wenyin, in Wuhan, there is Ma Zhemin, in Southwest, there is Pan Dakui, in Hunan, there is Du Maizhi, in Taiyuan, there is Wang Wenguang, in Zhejiang, there is Jiang Zhenzhong, and so on. Before and after the rectification, they used their pawns to light fires everywhere: demanding that league members speak out and air their views greatly; demanding the adoption of a "pressure from above and attack from within" tactic; demanding the abolition of the Party committee system in universities; demanding the abolition of Marxist-Leninist social sciences and the restoration of bourgeois social sciences in scientific planning; demanding the development of league members to millions, preferably developing some anti-Party intellectuals into the league; and demanding the re-rehabilitation of counter-revolutionary intellectuals who had committed counter-revolutionary crimes and were leniently treated by the government. They attempted to expand the league's influence, shift the league's direction, and turn the Democratic League, a democratic party, into a political party of bourgeois intellectuals, to usurp the Party's leadership and to oppose the Party and oppose socialism.

    Here, I want to point out that among backward intellectuals, there is a market for them. Over the past few years, under the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, the majority of intellectuals have made progress, and have also made certain contributions to socialist construction and socialist transformation. However, there are a few people who have returned from studying in Britain and the United States, for example, there are a few people in the Zhang-Luo alliance group, which are very difficult to deal with and are representative. There are also a few nondescript people who call themselves Marxists-Leninists, such as Ma Zhemin, Tao Dayong, and others, who are also very difficult to deal with and are also representative. They are never satisfied. Some people have risen from professors to deans, vice presidents, and even presidents, and are still not satisfied. Some people hold several or even dozens of positions and are still not satisfied; others are dissatisfied with the poor housing, the lack of transportation, the inadequate care for haircuts and face washes, and even say that the help is not enough despite the good and ample care. They have a set of theories, saying that the tradition of Chinese intellectuals should be respected by the government's "courtesy to the virtuous," and that they should be like Zhuge Liang, and Liu Bei should visit their thatched cottage three times. I am also an intellectual without knowledge, and I was also a university professor in the old China, but I was often persecuted, of course because they scolded me as a "Communist Party running dog." But I saw that many professors who were not Communist Party running dogs but Kuomintang running dogs were not respected; when they met the president, they could only sit on half of their buttocks; apart from paying you a certain salary, whether you live in a Western-style house or a thatched cottage, whether you take a car or walk, whether you eat enough or not, in short, he doesn't care about your life or death; arrears of wages are still common, and appointment letters are only issued for half a year; one hour of class is deducted for one hour of salary; it is really precarious, and I don't know where I will be next year. But at that time, I didn't hear them talk about the tradition of intellectuals, let alone see them resist. Living in a fire pit, they were at ease, and when they arrived in paradise, they couldn't stand the buzzing of bees. Some intellectuals just wanted to be lifted up but were not lifted up. Today, the Party and the government have taken care of people like this. Many people who cannot teach are still given living expenses, but they still complain, saying that they have positions but no duties. And people who can teach are not only asked to teach, but also asked to be principals and deans, but they say that they have positions but no power. What's good then? Please take out your heart and say a word, it should be the best that can be done. However, these so-called intellectuals say that the Party and the government are not good to them, and they want to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. I suddenly remembered a story, which is in comic books, called "Zhongshan Wolf." The Mohist Mr. Dongguo tried every means to save the wolf from the hunter's hands. After the wolf was saved, he turned to Mr. Dongguo and said: I am very hungry! Although you saved me, if I don't have anything to eat at this moment, I will still starve to death, sir! You are a Mohist, "Wear out the crown, rub the heel, and benefit the world," "Why begrudge a body, not to feed me, and save this humble life?" Thinking of this, I couldn't help but be shocked. These bourgeois right-wing elements, including Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Naiqi, Bi Mingqi, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Chu Anping and others, are all Zhongshan wolves. They are wolves, man-eating wolves, and we should kill them. Therefore, I say that it is not excessive at all for the congress to make a resolution to revoke their qualifications as people's representatives and their positions in state organs.

    Here, we must clearly recognize that the anti-rightist struggle is an extremely fierce class struggle, and this struggle was first launched by the bourgeois right-wing elements. We must rise up and fight back, and carry out this struggle to the end. At the same time, we must clearly recognize that one end of this class struggle front is domestic, and the other end has developed abroad. The Hong Kong imperialist newspapers and the Dulles clique are already "cheering" for the words and actions of the right-wing elements. Finally, we must clearly recognize that the power of the people cannot be defeated, and the prestige of the Party and Chairman Mao among the people is incomparably lofty and great. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, all of us people's representatives and the people of the whole country have the confidence and determination to win a complete victory in this fierce class struggle.

    Therefore, I want to warn the bourgeois right-wing elements, especially the right-wing intellectuals, that they must recognize the future, grasp their own destiny, correctly estimate the domestic and international situation, and only by thoroughly repenting, pulling out tendons and peeling skins, undergoing a complete transformation, and turning the wolf heart into a human heart, can there be a way out. Scientific and dialectical materialists affirm that human thoughts and everything can be transformed on the premise that existence determines consciousness. Premier Zhou Enlai has already warned you in his government work report that the door to socialist transformation is open. Those who can bow before the truth and surrender before the people are still good men. Human life has two aspects, one is natural life and the other is political life. Political life is more precious than natural life. Whether the political life of the bourgeois right-wing elements can be ultimately maintained is still in your own hands. Wolf? Human? Choose for yourself.

    When all of us people's representatives are waging the most resolute struggle against the right-wing elements under the watchful eyes of the people of the whole country, we should take the anti-rightist struggle as one of the main tasks of this congress, and we should unite closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, always follow the Communist Party, and always follow Chairman Mao.

    Long live the victory of socialist construction!
    Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great people's leader and mentor Chairman Mao!

      皆“中山狼”也！
      邓初民　斥责右派知识分子对共产党恩将仇报，警告他们彻底悔改，把狼心变人心，在真理和人民面前低头。
    请允许我不在开头重复我所同意的各位代表所说的话。我们是人民代表，我们就一定要代表人民的意志。人民要求的我们也要求；人民反对的我们也反对。否则，就根本不配为人民代表。不料在全国人民代表大会的代表中，在这一次整风前后，特别突出的暴露出来了不少资产阶级右派分子和右派首领分子，这些人已根本不配为人民代表了。我要代表全国人民对所有人民代表中的资产阶级右派分子，向大会提出控诉，并建议大会分别情节轻重作出决议，通过他们的原选举单位撤销他们的代表资格；其在国家机关中担任职务的（例如国务院的各部部长、副部长，各省、市的省长、市长、副省长、副市长，各高等学校的校长、院长、副校长、副院长等等），也应由大会分别情节轻重作出决议，交由国务院撤销其职务。
    我们像这样来处理人民代表中的右派分子，是否过分了呢？我以为一点也不过分。试看在右派首领分子中，有的基本上代表地主富农分子，例如龙云、黄绍竑等人；有的代表资产阶级落后分子，例如章乃器、毕鸣岐等人；有的代表资产阶级、小资产阶级落后知识分子，例如章伯钧、罗隆基等人。他们所代表的阶级成份虽各有不同，但目的却只有一个，那就是反党、反社会主义。龙云、黄绍竑等人装出悲天悯人的样子，说农民的生活苦、说肃反有偏差，一味强调缺点，抹煞成绩，把新中国说成漆黑一团，在这次小组讨论和大会讨论中，许多人民代表，特别是工人农民代表都拿新中国和旧中国工农生活的对比，把他们对党和人民政府的恶毒攻击，加以痛斥了。实际上，黄绍竑曾在旧中国的广西和浙江两省掌握军政大权，请他回忆一下那时广西浙江两省农民的生活怎样？所有人民的生活怎样？真可以说农村破产、城市萧条，他为维持他的血腥统治，反而屠杀无辜，特别是革命分子和进步人士，这在浙江和广西的代表中已把他的种种罪行揭发出来了。龙云统治云南十几年，跟黄绍竑也差不多，但有一点他可能比黄绍竑强些，就是在云南发展了生产——发展了毒害人民的鸦片烟生产！
    章乃器、毕鸣岐等人，特别是章乃器，似乎不能与黄绍竑、龙云相提并论。他在旧中国是以进步派自居的，可是桂系军阀也提拔他当过财政厅长；在新中国，党信任他，请他当了粮食部长，他当然仍以进步派自居啰！而且他认为比工人阶级更进步，认为他的理论水平比马列主义水平还高，说今天的资产阶级没有两面性好像才是真正的马列主义，说今天的资产阶级还有两面性却是教条主义。我看他既不是什么马列主义，也说不上教条主义，而恰恰是反党、反社会主义的资本主义。这一点，他倒是不打自招了。他说“资本主义有好有坏”，那等于说好的资本主义他是衷心拥护的。但他反党、反社会主义的本质，却一直没有承认。要章乃器承认他反党、反社会主义的真正本质，那就等于要历史上的反动统治阶级自动下台一样，这是不可能的。章乃器不可能承认其反党、反社会主义的本质，人民和大多数进步的资产阶级也不可能允许章乃器不承认其反党、反社会主义的本质。这样一来，章乃器就不是进步派了，而是落后派了；不仅是落后派，而且是孤立派了。天地之大，将无他容身之地，或者只可能暂时躲藏在他那终日口含着的小小的烟斗里。
    章伯钧、罗隆基等人好像既不能同龙云、黄绍竑等人相比，也不能同章乃器、毕鸣岐等人相比。他们野心更大，结成了章罗同盟，要搞“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”，他们利用民主同盟的组织成份主要是知识分子、文教界，利用他们在民主同盟的领导地位，于是伸手抓报馆，抓学校，抓所谓科学家，抓落后的知识分子，抓曾经犯有反革命罪行被政府宽大处理的反革命分子（也包括知识分子中的反革命分子），特别是抓民盟的各级地方组织，这几年来他们已抓到了一些人。试看这一次在整风运动中所暴露出来的资产阶级右派分子，就各民主党派来说，民盟可以算得是挂了帅的，就可证明。根据在中央揭露出来的民盟右派分子，有尽人皆知的六教授及其他，在天津有王大川，在上海有陈仁炳、彭文应，在武汉有马哲民，在西南有潘大逵，在湖南有杜迈之，在太原有王文光，在浙江有姜震中等等。整风前后他们就利用他们的爪牙，到处点火：要盟员大放、大鸣；要采取“上下压”、“内外攻”的夹击战术；要在高等学校中取消党委制；要在科学规划中取消马列主义的社会科学，恢复资产阶级的社会科学；要发展盟员到几百万，最好是把一些反党的知识分子发展到盟内来；要为曾经犯有反革命罪行被政府宽大处理了的反革命知识分子重新加以平反。企图这样来扩大盟的声势，转移盟的方向，把民盟这一个民主党派，变成资产阶级知识分子的政党，来篡夺党的领导权，来反党、反社会主义。
    这里我要指出，在落后的知识分子中，是有他们的市场的。几年来，在党团结教育改造知识分子的政策下，大多数的知识分子是有进步的，对社会主义建设和社会主义改造也有一定的贡献。然而，就有那么几个从英美留学回来的人，例如章罗同盟集团就有那么几个人，很难搞，他们是有代表性的。还有那么几个不三不四自名为马列主义的人，例如马哲民、陶大镛等人也很难搞，他们也是有代表性的。他们从来不会满足，有些人从教授升到教务长、副校长乃至校长，仍然不满足，有的人身兼数职乃至数十职，仍然不满足；其次的人对于房子住得不好，对于没有交通工具不满足，对于剪头洗脸没有照顾得够不满足，对于照顾好了照顾多了的又说帮助不够也不满足。他们有一套理论，说中国知识分子的传统要受到政府“礼贤下士”的尊重，要像诸葛亮一样，要有刘备去三顾茅庐。我也是一个没有知识的知识分子，在旧中国也当过大学教授，可是常常受到迫害的，那当然由于他们骂我是“共产党走狗”。但我看到许多不是共产党走狗而是国民党走狗的教授们，也并没有受到尊重；晋见校长时只能坐半边屁股；除了按一定的薪金发给你外，你住洋房或住茅房，你坐车或步行，你吃得饱或吃不饱，总之你的死活，他一切不管；欠薪还是经常的事，发聘书只发半年；少上一点钟的课就扣一点钟的薪；真是朝不保夕，不知明年又在何处。但是那时我就没有听到他们讲什么知识分子的传统，更没有看到他们有什么反抗，住在火坑里，心安理得，一到乐园反而听不得蜜蜂叫，有些知识分子，就硬是这样要抬举而又不受抬举。今天党和政府把像这样的人都包下来了。许多不能教书的人，仍然给他们的生活费，但他们还要发牢骚，说有职无务。而能教书的人，不仅请他教书，而且请他当校长、院长，却又说有职无权。那怎么好呢？请大家把心肝捧出来说一句话，应该是仁至义尽了。然而这些所谓知识分子，却说党和政府对他们不好，他们要反党、反社会主义。我突然想起一个故事来了，这个故事是小人书上都有的，叫做“中山狼”，墨者东郭先生想种种的办法把狼从猎人的手中救出来了，狼得救后，却转向东郭先生说：我的肚子饿得很呀！你虽然把我救出来了，如果此刻没有东西吃，我还是要饿死的，先生！你是墨者，“摩顶放踵，利天下为之”“又何吝一躯，不以啖我，而活此微命乎？”我想到这里，不禁大吃一惊，这些资产阶级右派分子，包括龙云、黄绍竑、章乃器、毕鸣岐、章伯钧、罗隆基、储安平等人在内，皆中山狼也。是狼，是吃人的狼，我们就应该打死它。因而我说，要大会作出决议，撤销他们的人民代表资格和国家机关职务，是一点也不过分的。
    这里，我们必须明确认识，反右派斗争，是一场异常激烈的阶级斗争，而且这场斗争是资产阶级右派分子首先发动的，我们必须起而应战，把这场斗争进行到底。同时，必须明确认识，这场阶级斗争战线的一端在国内，而其另一端已发展到国外，香港帝国主义报纸和杜勒斯之流，已经在为右派分子的言论行动“喝采”。最后，我们必须明确认识，人民的力量是不可能战胜的，党和毛主席在人民中的威信是无比崇高巨大的，我们全体人民代表和全国人民，在党和毛主席的领导之下，有信心有决心在这一场激烈的阶级斗争中获得全胜。
    因此，我要警告资产阶级右派分子，特别是右派知识分子，必须认清前途，掌握自己的命运，正确估计国内外形势，只有彻底悔改，抽筋剥皮，脱胎换骨，把狼心变成人心，才是生路。科学的、辩证的唯物主义者，在存在决定意识的前提下，肯定人的思想和一切都是可以改造的。周恩来总理在政府工作报告中，已经正告你们，社会主义改造的大门是敞开着的。能在真理的面前低头和在人民的面前投降的人，还是好汉。人的生命是具有两重性的，一是自然生命，一是政治生命。政治生命比起自然生命来是更为宝贵的。资产阶级右派分子的政治生命，是否最终得以保持，其权还是操在你们自己手里。狼乎？人乎自择焉可也。
    我们全体人民代表，在全国人民注视中向右派分子作最坚决斗争的时候，应该把反右派斗争作为这次大会的主要任务之一，应该紧密团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，永远跟着共产党走，永远跟着毛主席走。
    社会主义建设胜利万岁！
    伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
