    Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革)
    Unmasking Chen Mingshu’s "Anti-Chiang" and "Resist Japan" Facade

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that on the morning of July 7, the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) continued. This meeting focused on criticizing the reactionary statements of rightist Chen Mingshu, and historically exposed his consistent anti-communist, anti-people, anti-socialist, and two-faced tactics. At the meeting, Chen Mingshu made empty and meaningless self-criticisms, attempting to gloss over his errors and muddle through. More than sixty people attended the meeting, and in addition to Chen Mingshu, Yu Yanong, Wang Kunlun, Yu Zhenying, Liu Mengchun, Cai Tingkai, Qu Wu, Zhu Xuefan, Shao Hengqiu, Mei Gongbin, Wu Maosun, and Nie Hong spoke.
    Chen Mingshu first spoke at the meeting. Regarding the issue of abolishing the Party Committee system in schools, he admitted that his "original intention was to replace the Party Committee responsibility system with the school affairs committee responsibility system," but he also said that he did not intend to eliminate the Party's leadership. Regarding his advocacy of "only mentioning shortcomings and not mentioning advantages," Chen Mingshu made various defenses. He said that his motives were good, but after examination, he found that his motives were not good. He believed that his main problems were "serious personal heroism" and "liberalism." Regarding his reactionary remarks, he believed that he had only "helped the Party backwards and boosted the morale of right-wing ambitious elements."

    Chen Mingshu Displays Great Consideration for Counter-Revolutionaries
    Wang Kunlun questioned Chen Mingshu, "Why did Chen Mingshu recently introduce Wang Cifu, a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts, to me and want to arrange work for him?"
    Chen Mingshu equivocated on this question.
    Yu Zhenying said that historically, Chen Mingshu has been a consistently fickle and two-faced political careerist.
    Yu Zhenying said that from the Old Political Consultative Conference to before liberation, Chen Mingshu opposed Chiang Kai-shek on the one hand, but on the other hand, he maintained friendships and relationships with American and Chiang's secret agents. For example, Luo Haisha, who recited Buddhist scriptures with him in Chongqing, was a lackey of Zheng Jiemin, the head of American and Chiang's secret service. Chen Mingshu turned a blind eye to Luo Haisha's secret copying of the list of the Democratic League (San Min Chu I Comrades Association) in Chongqing. After arriving in Nanjing, Luo Haisha built a house in front of his Da Shi Farm to monitor the comings and goings of progressive people. He wanted Luo Haisha to carry his briefcase and follow him everywhere; everyone repeatedly asked him to be vigilant, but he ignored them.
    Yu Zhenying said that during the Huaihai Campaign in 1948, Chen Mingshu had close contact with Zheng Jiemin, the head of the American and Chiang's secret service, through Luo Haisha. He even insisted on introducing Zheng Jiemin to join the Democratic League organization. Due to my firm refusal, he labeled me with the hat of "refusing others to make revolution"; it was not until I produced evidence of Zheng Jiemin's and the British Embassy's secret agent Evans' conspiracy to arrange hidden activities after the liberation of Nanjing that he had nothing to say. But he still believed in Zheng Jiemin and became Zheng Jiemin's mouthpiece. Chen Mingshu also concealed from us that he dispatched military intelligence agent Zhang Shengcai to engage in activities in Fujian under the guise of the Democratic League. He also talked to Stuart, Leighton, many times through Zheng Jiemin's introduction. Yu Zhenying asked: What exactly did you talk about? What kind of tricks did you play?
    Yu Zhenying said that when the reactionary leader Li Zongren was facing collapse, the Democratic League originally decided to send Chen Mingshu to Hong Kong to assist Li Jishen in preparing for the work of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革), but Chen Mingshu always lingered in Nanjing and Shanghai, and engaged in enthusiastic activities with Zheng Jiemin and other secret agents, and refused to go south.
    On the eve of liberation, Chen Mingshu left Luo Haisha and went from Nanjing to Shanghai; but after liberation, he pulled Luo Haisha back again and said that Luo Haisha had made "contributions to the revolution," and recommended him to study at the North China Revolutionary University, and later introduced him to join the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) organization. What was the purpose of Chen's meticulous care for secret agents?
    After liberation, Chen Mingshu was still ambitious, engaged in activities everywhere, and actively prepared political capital and economic strength. The so-called welfare company that he and Chen Youguang ran was to prepare funds for his political activities.
    Since last year, Chen Mingshu has spread anti-socialist remarks, such as saying that "the Party's arrangements for old intellectuals are inappropriate" and "the Party does not respect the virtuous and employ the capable," to provoke relations between the Party and intellectuals, in order to win over the masses. When he inspected Qingdao last summer, he engaged in activities among intellectuals. Last winter, he secretly visited middle schools in Beijing, specifically looking for problems and deviations among teachers who had emotions due to grading, who had been struggled against due to counter-suppression, and who were backward. This year, when he went to Shanghai, he continued to collect "poisonous weeds" and held a grand banquet for his "old subordinates" at Wu Yiwu's house, setting off a wave of reactionary activities by right-wing elements in the Shanghai Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) organization.
    Yu Zhenying also said that in a letter Chen Mingshu wrote to Li Xuefeng last winter, he actually believed that "the Communist Party's sending of Party members to participate in democratic parties is something that even the most intelligent politicians of feudal dynasties would not do." This view is as bad as the demand for the CCP to withdraw from schools.
    Liu Mengchun said that Chen Mingshu said that his opinion on abolishing the school Party Committee system was casual, but it was not true. At the beginning of this year, when the CPPCC held an inspection symposium, he did his best to slander the Party's leadership of the school. Chen Mingshu also said that some professors often went to his home to discuss issues. Liu Mengchun asked: Who are these professors? Are they some people within the Zhang-Luo alliance?

    Chen Mingshu's Approach to Progressive Forces is Insincere
    Cai Tingkai traced back to events of thirty years ago, explaining that Chen Mingshu has always adopted an opposing attitude toward revolution. Cai Tingkai said that Chen Mingshu was once my superior. In 1922, when Chen Jiongming rebelled against the revolution in Guangdong, Chen Mingshu led a regiment and remained inactive, watching Mr. Sun Yat-sen suffer without helping. Li Zhangda and others blamed him for this counter-revolutionary behavior and said they wanted to kill Chen Mingshu, so he hurriedly handed over his troops to Chen Jitang and ran to Nanjing to become a monk. Later, when Sun Yat-sen wanted to unify Guangdong, he won him over and made him a brigade commander. However, when the Northern Expedition was at a critical juncture, Chen Mingshu ran to Chiang Kai-shek to become an official.
    Then, Cai Tingkai used a large number of historical facts to illustrate that Chen Mingshu has always supported Chiang Kai-shek, and his approach to progressive forces when he had no choice was also insincere. Cai Tingkai said that from the failure of the Great Revolution to the establishment of the Fujian People's Government, Chen Mingshu leaned towards Hu Hanmin for a while, Chiang Kai-shek for a while, and Wang Jingwei for a while, acting opportunistically.
    Talking about Chen Mingshu during the Anti-Japanese War, Cai Tingkai believed that he did not actively participate in the war at that time. On the contrary, he had close contact with Chiang Kai-shek's secret service chiefs and opposed and undermined the democratic and progressive forces in the Kuomintang. On the eve of the national liberation, he lived in Shanghai, while we were all in Hong Kong. We repeatedly asked him to go to Hong Kong to discuss the anti-Chiang plan together, but he refused, and instead engaged in close contact with the secret service chief Zheng Jiemin in Shanghai.

    Chen Mingshu Supports Liang Shuming's Opposition to the General Line
    In his speech, Qu Wu focused on exposing Chen Mingshu's reactionary words and deeds against socialism and against the Party's leadership after liberation.
    Qu Wu said that in 1953, Chairman Mao put forward the Party's general line during the transition period. At the enlarged meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Liang Shuming openly opposed the general line and the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and was unanimously criticized by those present. At that time, Chen Mingshu defended Liang Shuming. The reason why Chen Mingshu defended Liang Shuming so loyally was because Liang Shuming said what he wanted to say in his heart at that time, which aroused the resonance of his class instinct. In May of this year, Chen Mingshu took advantage of the opportunity of the great blooming and contending to engage in activities in Shanghai, spreading the argument that the Communist Party could not lead schools, and also supported Luo Haisha, who taught in middle school, to engage in great democracy in the school and drive away the Communist Party branch secretary.
    Qu Wu said that during his tenure as the director of the Academic Committee of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革), Chen Mingshu said on many occasions that ideological reform only requires practice, and theoretical study is just learning some dogmas, which is useless. In fact, he opposed studying Marxism-Leninism theory and opposed ideological reform. Chen Mingshu also talked about the relationship between Buddhism and dialectics in the magazine "Modern Buddhism," and vigorously promoted the theory of combining Marxism-Leninism and Buddhism, which distorted Buddhism and distorted Marxism-Leninism.
    Shao Hengqiu said that Luo Haisha, a military intelligence agent of the Kuomintang, was originally said to be monitoring Chen Mingshu, but later Chen Mingshu became very close to him. After the liberation of Nanjing in 1949, Chen Mingshu appointed Luo Haisha as the finance committee member of the Nanjing Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) organization at that time. The organization was very chaotic at that time, and later it was discovered that Luo Haisha was the main person who created the chaos.
    Mei Gongbin systematically exposed Chen Mingshu's criminal history
    Mei Gongbin said that Chen Mingshu's self-criticism was avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, and was not to the point. He has no understanding or repentance of his anti-socialist words and deeds, and we cannot agree with such a self-criticism.

    Shielding Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    Mei Gongbin said that after liberation, Chen Mingshu repeatedly shielded counter-revolutionary elements. Li Renfu was a counter-revolutionary element who betrayed the Party and sold out the Party. In 1951, Chen Mingshu recommended him to be a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) in Wuhan. Some people expressed their firm opposition at the Central Standing Committee, but Chen Mingshu declared that he guaranteed that Li had no political problems. After Chen pulled Li into the Preparatory Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) in Wuhan, he let him edit "Wuhan Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革)," and a serious error occurred in the inaugural issue (publishing articles that distorted Chairman Mao's talks and damaged united front relations, etc.). In 1954, Li Renfu sent a letter from Wuhan to several persons in charge of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革), requesting to be transferred to work in Beijing and asking to be introduced to teach in a university. Chen Mingshu attached a few lines to Li's letter, once again guaranteeing that Li had no problems with politics and history. The Central Committee rejected Li's request. During the suppression of counterrevolutionaries in 1955, the government found out that Li Renfu was a counterrevolutionary element with many blood debts and arrested him.
    Wang Cifu, a politician of the Political Science Department who had done a lot of evil before liberation and had a close relationship with Zhang Bojun, was recommended by Zhang Bojun to the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (中共), but was rejected. Chen Mingshu privately pulled him into the Preparatory Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) in Wuhan, sharing part of the important duties of Deng Feihuang, a member of the Standing Committee. During the Three-Anti Movement, Wang Cifu's crimes before liberation were exposed by the people. The responsible comrades of the United Front Work Department of the Central China Bureau of the CPC gave Chen Mingshu historical crime materials such as Wang's blood debt for massacring more than 300 Communist Party members and people when he was the commissioner of Luoyang in Henan before liberation, and his stubborn resistance to the Red Army and reorganization of Baojia when he was the director of the Civil Affairs Department in Jiangxi, hoping that Chen and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) would mobilize Wang to automatically confess. However, Chen did not hesitate to undermine the movement and secretly showed the materials to Wang Cifu; at the same time, in order to escape the investigation of Wang by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) and the criticism of him, he secretly sent Wang to Beijing and asked the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) to solve Wang's work problems.

    Colluding with Kuomintang Secret Agents
    Why is it that Chen Mingshu cannot distinguish between enemies and friends? Of course, it is not accidental. Because he firmly stands on the anti-people's stand, he colluded with Kuomintang secret agents long before liberation.
    When the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary ruling clique tore up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference and brazenly launched the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, many democratic people who were originally in Nanjing and Shanghai went to Hong Kong one after another, erected the banner of anti-Chiang, anti-American and anti-civil war, and insisted on the democratic movement. At that time, Chen Mingshu stubbornly stayed in Shanghai. Li Jishen, Jiang Guangnai, and others repeatedly urged him to go to Hong Kong to carry out the democratic revolution together, but he always used various excuses to prevaricate. Originally, he was ostensibly engaged in defection work, but in fact he had close contacts with secret agents there. Later, facts proved that there were a group of secret agents around him at that time, such as Luo Haisha, Wang Shiliang, and Song Zhenghao. Not only that, he also colluded with Zheng Jiemin, the head of military intelligence. As he said, he was engaged in defection work at that time. Did he defect from the secret service chief Zheng Jiemin, or did Zheng Jiemin defect from him? Judging from the fact that he repeatedly shielded counter-revolutionary elements after liberation, I am afraid he was defected from!

    Colluding with Trotskyites
    Mei Gongbin said that Chen Mingshu was not satisfied with colluding with secret agents. In order to display his political ambitions, he did not hesitate to collude with Trotskyites. One thing I saw with my own eyes, and two things I heard. First, let's talk about what I heard. Peng Shuzhi, the Trotskyite leader who was second only to Chen Duxiu, was introduced by secret agent Wang Shiliang, and Chen Mingshu was prepared to arrange for him to be the editor-in-chief of the Shenzhou Guoguang Society. Another Trotskyite leader, Du Weizhi, Chen Mingshu kept him at his residence in Chongqing for many years. One thing I saw with my own eyes was that in 1936, we were all in Hong Kong. At that time, the Trotskyite leader Zhang Mutao came south from Shanxi. Chen Mingshu invited him to live in Kowloon, talked secretly for a few days, admired him to the point of worship, and attempted to jointly organize an anti-communist and anti-people Trotskyite political party.

      Colluding with American Imperialism
    Mei Gongbin said that in 1949, Chen Mingshu came to Beijing from Shanghai, which had just been liberated, and actually "offered a plan" to Premier Zhou, saying that if the CPC was willing to compromise with the United States, Stuart Leighton guaranteed that the United States could provide China with how much US dollars. This shows that in order to satisfy his personal political ambitions, Chen Mingshu even wanted to sell out the interests of the country and the people. Chen Mingshu claimed to be a loyal supporter of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas, but he was willing to be a running dog of American imperialism, and was ordered by Stuart Leighton to act as a lobbyist, attempting to make the Chinese people once again become slaves to American colonialism.

    Nominally Anti-Chiang, Actually Anti-Communist;
    Nominally Resisting Japan, Actually Supporting Chiang
    Mei Gongbin said that from the above facts, not to mention that Chen Mingshu's talk about supporting the Party's leadership and supporting socialism today is all false; even the anti-imperialist, anti-Japanese, and anti-Chiang actions before liberation were also stealing fame and deceiving the world. To put it bluntly, he is: nominally anti-Chiang, actually anti-communist; nominally resisting Japan, actually supporting Chiang. The facts are as follows:
      (1) Around the "September 18th" Incident, the people of the Southwest Military and Political Committee in Guangzhou conspired to oppose Chiang. At that time, Chen was the chairman of Guangdong Province and controlled the military power of the 19th Route Army, becoming one of the key figures, but he would rather lose the chairmanship of Guangdong Province than oppose Chiang, and actually left Guangdong and ran to Japan. But later, He Yingqin telegraphed to invite him back to China, and he returned without hesitation, and went to Jiangxi to serve as the commander of the left-wing army of the Communist Suppression (He Yingqin himself served as the commander of the right-wing army).
      (2) In 1933, Li Jishen, Chen and I were all in Hong Kong. At that time, the anti-Chiang plan centered on the 19th Route Army in Fujian was brewing. Huang Shaohong, Chiang Kai-shek's confidant and then the chairman of Zhejiang Province, suddenly arrived in Hong Kong, pretending to discuss the anti-Chiang plan with him, but in fact he was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to find out the details of the anti-Chiang plan of the 19th Route Army so that Chiang Kai-shek could know how to deal with it. Once, Li Jishen, Huang Shaohong, Chen and I took a steamship to the sea for secret consultation. Strangely, from the beginning, he told Huang all the anti-Chiang plans of the 19th Route Army (including the plan to unite with the Red Army). The cunning Huang Shaohong pretended to say that once the 19th Route Army approached the border of Zhejiang, he would announce independence in Zhejiang to respond. After Huang found out the inside story, he went back and told Chiang Kai-shek one by one. Later, when the anti-Chiang movement of the Fujian People's Government was launched, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized the main force to enter Fujian from Zhejiang and attacked the main force of the 19th Route Army with swift and violent methods. Chen Mingshu should be held largely responsible for the rapid failure of the revolutionary movement of the Fujian People's Government.
    (3) In 1936, Chen returned to China from Moscow, claiming that he accepted the "August 1 Declaration" put forward by the Communist Party. However, when the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1937, Chen was blinded by profit as soon as he arrived in Nanjing. In order to cater to the wishes of the reactionary group, he initiated the dissolution of the National Revolutionary League without obtaining the consent of Li Jishen and others, and arbitrarily announced the dissolution of the League.

    Exposing Chen Mingshu's Ugly History is to Make Him Recognize the Seriousness of His Mistakes
    Mei Gongbin finally said that we originally did not want to settle old scores. If after liberation, he could cut off his consistent political ambitions in the past, thoroughly recognize his past sins, and honestly follow the people, the people would certainly no longer pursue history, and we would not need to mention the past again. But the fact is not like this. Now, in order to help him recognize the extreme seriousness of the mistakes he has made now, we cannot but trace back to the ideological roots, and it is inevitable to relate to some historical facts. This is of great benefit to him to face the present and clarify the future direction.

    Chen Mingshu Uses the Anti-Japanese Banner of the 19th Route Army to Deceive the People
    In his speech, Wu Maosun exposed several facts that can see through Chen Mingshu's true face.
    The first thing: In 1922, Sun Yat-sen launched the Northern Expedition, and the army reached Shaoguan. Chen Mingshu was then the commander of the fourth regiment of the first division of the Guangdong Army. He actually colluded with Chen Jiongming to rebel through Huang Jusu, showing very bad behavior. Mr. Sun Yat-sen hated this betrayal very much.
    The second thing: Chen Mingshu has always used anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang as political capital. Wu Maosun said, I want to expose today that his anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang are completely fake. In the winter of 1931, the internal contradictions of the Kuomintang were very acute, and the so-called Ning-Yue peace talks were held in Shanghai. At that time, everyone agreed that Chiang Kai-shek would step down, the 19th Route Army would be stationed in the Ning-Hu area, and Sun Ke would be appointed as the president of the Executive Yuan to organize the government. At that time, Wang Jingwei claimed to be ill and stayed in the hospital. Suddenly, one day, he left the hospital and went to Hangzhou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. Chen Mingshu was then the vice president of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Transportation, and commander of the Garrison of Jing-Hu, holding three important positions. He flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou the next day to meet with Chiang and Wang. He used the 19th Route Army as capital to support Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, and Sun Ke was forced to step down. At that time, Li Jishen was in Shanghai and was originally preparing to go to Nanjing to serve as the chairman of the Central Political Conference and participate in the anti-Chiang government, but he did not go because of Chen's betrayal. Later, the National Disaster Conference was held in Luoyang, and Chen Mingshu talked a lot about Chiang and Wang's cooperation and overcoming national difficulties together. May I ask, is Chen Mingshu anti-Chiang or pro-Chiang?
    Wu Maosun said that as for resisting Japan, Chen Mingshu also had no part in it. The "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Route Army is a heroic and glorious history of the Chinese people. Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai were heroic figures admired by the whole country at that time. However, Chen Mingshu was not sincerely resisting Japan at that time. On the eve of "January 28th", Chen Mingshu also called Jiang Guangnai and asked him to go to Nanjing immediately. Chen Mingshu said to Jiang Guangnai that the situation in front was urgent and he could not go. At that time, everyone knew that Chen Mingshu wanted to prevent the 19th Route Army from confronting the Japanese head-on. After the Luoyang Conference, Chen Mingshu flew from Luoyang to Zhenru and distributed the shameless withdrawal declaration drafted by Sun Xiwent. In this way, he betrayed the 19th Route Army, pleased the Japanese, and pleased Chiang Kai-shek. May I ask Chen Mingshu, are you really resisting Japan or are you pretending to resist Japan? If you still vainly attempt to use the anti-Japanese banner of the 19th Route Army to deceive the people today, the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the 19th Route Army will not agree!
    Wu Maosun also cited some facts to illustrate Chen Mingshu's ambition to usurp the leadership of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革), and pointed out that Chen Mingshu had a greater conspiracy and formed a small group in Shanghai. Regarding the situation of this small group, Wu Maosun asked Chen Mingshu to thoroughly explain.
    Finally, Wu Maosun said that from the materials exposed today, Chen Mingshu has always been speculative and fickle, and has always betrayed the revolution and betrayed friends. Why did Chen Mingshu stay in Nanjing and refuse to go to Hong Kong one or two years before liberation? According to my analysis, Chen Mingshu wanted to speculate on both sides. On the one hand, he contacted democratic parties to show that he was progressive; on the other hand, he wanted to use the 19th Route Army as capital to collude with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and attempt to sell out the revolution. From this, it can be seen that his anti-Japanese, anti-Chiang, and anti-American are all fake, and his collusion with secret agents, collusion with Trotskyites, collusion with imperialism, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist are real. He is a right-wing ambitious element who opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and we must peel off Chen Mingshu's face in front of all the comrades of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (民革) and in front of the people of the whole country!

### 民革中央小组扩大会议  揭开陈铭枢“反蒋”“抗日”的假面具

    民革中央小组扩大会议
    揭开陈铭枢“反蒋”“抗日”的假面具
    本报讯　7月7日上午，民革中央小组扩大会议继续举行。这次会议集中地批判了右派分子陈铭枢的反动言论，并且从历史上揭发了他的一贯反共、反人民、反社会主义，玩弄两面手法的丑恶面目。陈铭枢在会上曾作了空洞无物的检讨，自我粉饰，企图蒙混过关。到会的有六十多人，除陈铭枢外，发言的有余亚农、王昆仑、于振瀛、刘孟纯、蔡廷锴、屈武、朱学范、邵恒秋、梅龚彬、吴茂荪、聂轰。　　陈铭枢在会上首先发言。关于取消学校中的党委制问题，他承认他的“本心是要以校务委员会负责制来代替党委负责制，但他又说他没有想到取消党的领导。关于他主张“只提缺点，不提优点”问题，陈铭枢多方辩解。他说自己的动机是好的，但是经过检查，他又发现自己的动机不是良好的。他认为他的主要毛病是“严重的个人英雄主义”，“自由主义作风”。对于他发表的反动言论，他认为只是“为党帮了倒忙，为右派野心家张了目”。
    陈铭枢对反革命分子体贴入微
    王昆仑质问陈铭枢说，陈铭枢为甚么最近又介绍有血债的反革命分子王次甫给我，要安置他的工作？
    对这个问题，陈铭枢支吾其词。
    于振瀛说，从历史上看，陈铭枢是一个一贯反复无常，两面摇摆的政治野心家。
    于振瀛说，从旧政协开始一直到解放前，陈铭枢一面反对蒋介石，一面却和美蒋特务讲交情，搞关系。例如和他在重庆一块念佛的罗海沙就是美蒋特务头子郑介民的喽啰。陈铭枢对罗海沙在重庆偷抄民联（三民主义同志联合会）名单的事情，视若无睹。到南京后，罗海沙在他的大士农庄门前筑屋居住，监视进步人士的往来。他要罗海沙给他夹着皮包随他到处活动；大家一再要他提高警惕，他置之不理。
    于振瀛说，1948年淮海战役的时候，陈铭枢通过罗海沙，和美蒋特务头子郑介民往还颇密。他甚至坚持介绍郑介民参加民联组织，由于我的坚决拒绝，他竟给我戴上了“拒绝人家革命”的帽子；一直到我拿出了郑介民和英大使馆的特务艾文思预谋布置在南京解放后的潜伏活动证据时，他才没有话说。但他以后仍然相信郑介民，成了郑介民的传声筒。陈铭枢还隐瞒着我们，派遣军统特务张圣才假借民联名义到福建从事活动。还经过郑介民的介绍，和司徒雷登谈过多次话。于振瀛问：你们究竟谈了些什么？搞了些什么把戏？
    于振瀛说，在反动头子李宗仁已面临垮台的时候，民联原来曾决定派陈铭枢去香港协助李济深筹组民革工作，但陈铭枢始终留恋宁沪，和郑介民等特务搞得火热，不肯南下。
    在解放前夕，陈铭枢才离开罗海沙，由南京到上海；但在解放以后，又把罗海沙拉回来，并且说罗海沙对“革命有功”，把他保送到华北革大学习，以后又把他介绍参加了民革组织。陈对特务分子的这样体贴入微，到底为了甚么？
    解放以后，陈铭枢仍旧野心勃勃，到处活动，积极准备政治资本和经济力量。他和陈有光搞的甚么福利公司，就是为自己的政治活动准备资金。
    去年以来，陈铭枢就散布反社会主义言论，如说甚么“党对旧知识分子安排不当”、“党没有礼贤下士”等等，来挑拨党和知识分子的关系，借以拉拢群众。去年夏季他到青岛视察时，曾在知识分子中活动，去年冬季他秘密地访察北京市的中等学校，专门在因评级而有情绪的、因肃反而被斗过的以及落后的教员中找问题，寻偏差。今年他到上海又继续搜集“毒草”，并在吴艺五的家里大宴他的“旧部下”，点了火，在上海民革组织中掀起了右派分子的反动活动的波浪。
    于振瀛还说，去冬陈铭枢在写给李雪峰的一封信中，居然认为：“共产党派党员参加民主党派，是封建王朝稍有头脑的政治家所不取的。”这种看法同要求中共退出学校同样恶劣。
    刘孟纯说，陈铭枢说关于取消学校党委制的意见是随便说出来的，其实并非如此。今年年初在政协举行视察座谈会的时候，他就对党领导学校，极尽污蔑之能事。陈铭枢还说有一些教授经常到他家去谈问题。刘孟纯问：这些教授是些甚么人？是不是章罗联盟内的一些人？
    陈铭枢接近进步势力是假心假意的
    蔡廷锴在会上追溯了三十几年的往事，说明陈铭枢一贯对革命就采取了反对的态度。蔡廷锴说，陈铭枢曾经是我的上司，1922年，陈炯明在广东叛变革命时，陈铭枢率领一个团按兵不动，眼看着中山先生蒙难不救。李章达等责备他这种反革命行为说要杀陈铭枢，他就急急忙忙把兵交给陈济棠，自己跑到南京当和尚去了。后来，孙中山要统一广东时，争取他，让他当旅长，可是北伐战争到了紧急关头，陈铭枢又跑到蒋介石那里做官去了。
    接着，蔡廷锴用大量的历史事实，说明陈铭枢一贯拥蒋，不得已时接近进步势力，也是假心假意的。蔡廷锴说，从大革命失败到福建人民政府成立这一段，陈铭枢一时靠拢胡汉民，一时靠拢蒋介石，一时靠拢汪精卫，朝秦暮楚。
    谈到抗战时期的陈铭枢，蔡廷锴认为他那时并没有积极参加抗战，反而同蒋介石的特务头子密切往还，反对和破坏国民党中的民主进步力量。全国解放前夕，他住在上海，我们大家在香港，曾一再请他到香港去共商反蒋大计，他却拒绝，而在上海同特务头子郑介民密切往还。 
    陈铭枢支持梁漱溟反对总路线
    屈武在发言中，着重揭发了陈铭枢在解放以后反对社会主义反对党的领导的反动言行。
    屈武说，1953年，毛主席提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，在中央人民政府委员会扩大会议上，梁漱溟公开反对总路线、反对优先发展重工业的方针，受到到会的人一致批驳。当时，陈铭枢却为梁漱溟辩护。陈铭枢所以这样忠心耿耿地为梁漱溟辩护，那是因为梁漱溟当时说出了他心里要说的话，引起了他阶级本能的共鸣。今年5月，陈铭枢乘着大鸣大放的机会到上海活动，散播共产党不能领导学校的言论，还支持在中学任教的罗海沙在学校里搞大民主，要赶走共产党的支部书记。
    屈武说，陈铭枢在担任民革中央学委会主任期间，在许多场合都说思想改造只有实践，理论学习只不过是学些教条，是没有用处的。实际上他是反对学习马列主义理论，反对思想改造。陈铭枢还曾在“现代佛学”杂志上，大谈佛学与辩证法的关系，大力提倡马列主义和佛学合一的理论，既歪曲了佛学，更歪曲了马列主义。
    邵恒秋说，国民党军统特务罗海沙，听说原是监视陈铭枢的，后来陈铭枢竟和他搞得非常亲密。1949年南京解放后，陈铭枢又把罗海沙任为当时南京民革组织的财务委员。当时组织非常混乱，后来发现罗海沙就是制造混乱的主要人物。
    梅龚彬系统地揭露了陈铭枢的罪恶历史
    梅龚彬说，陈铭枢的检讨，避重就轻，不着边际。他对自己的反社会主义的言行，毫无认识和悔悟，我们不能同意这样的检讨。
    包庇反革命分子
    梅龚彬说，解放后，陈铭枢一再包庇反革命分子。李任夫是一个叛党卖党的反革命分子，1951年陈铭枢竟推荐他任民革武汉市筹委会委员，在中央常务委员会上有人表示坚决反对，陈铭枢却声明担保李无政治问题。陈把李拉进民革武汉市筹委会后，让他编辑“武汉民革”，在创刊号上就发生了严重错误（刊载歪曲毛主席谈话和损害统战关系的文稿等）。1954年李任夫由武汉致函民革中央几位负责人，请求调北京工作，并要求介绍他到大学任教，陈铭枢就在李的信上附字数行，再度为李保证政治、历史无问题。中央拒绝了李的要求。1955年肃反运动中，政府查明李任夫是一个血债累累的反革命分子，逮捕了他。
    解放前作恶甚多、与章伯钧关系甚深的政学系政客王次甫，曾由章伯钧提请中共统战部安排，遭到拒绝。陈铭枢竟私自把他拉到民革武汉市筹委会去，分担常委邓飞黄的一部分重要职务。在三反运动中，王次甫解放前的罪恶被人民揭发出来，中共中南局统战部负责同志把王解放前在河南任洛阳专员时屠杀共产党员和群众三百余人的血债，以及在江西任民政厅长时顽抗红军、整编保甲等历史罪恶材料交给陈铭枢看，希望陈和民革市委动员王自动坦白交代。但陈不惜破坏运动，竟把材料私下给王次甫看了；同时为逃避民革市委对王的追查和对他的批评，又私自把王送来北京，并要求民革中央为王解决工作问题。
    勾结国民党特务
    陈铭枢为甚么竟至敌我不分呢？当然不是偶然的，由于他坚决站在反人民立场，早在解放之前他就曾勾结过国民党特务。
    当蒋介石反动统治集团撕毁旧政协决议，悍然发动反共反人民内战后，许多原在南京、上海的民主人士先后到香港，竖起反蒋反美反内战的旗帜，坚持民主运动。当时，陈铭枢却固执地留在上海。李济深、蒋光鼐等曾一再催他到香港一同进行民主革命事业，但他总是用各种借口推托不来。原来他是美其名曰搞策反，实际上在那里和特务密切往来。后来事实证明，那时在他周围，有罗海沙、王师亮、宋正浩等一群特务。不止于此，他还和军统头子郑介民勾勾搭搭。如他所说的，他那时在搞策反，究竟是他策反了特务头子郑介民，还是郑介民策反了他呢？从他在解放后一再包庇反革命分子的事实看来，恐怕他被策反了吧！
    勾结托派
    梅龚彬说，陈铭枢并不以勾结特务为满足，为着施展他的政治野心，竟不惜勾结托派。有一件是我亲眼见的，有两件是耳闻的。先说耳闻的，仅次于陈独秀的托派头子彭述之，经由特务王师亮的介绍，陈铭枢曾准备把他安置在神州国光社任总编辑。另一托派头子杜畏之，陈铭枢把他留住在重庆住所，一住经年。亲眼见的一件事是：1936年我们都在香港，那时托派头子张慕陶由山西南来，陈铭枢邀他住在九龙，密谈几天，对他佩服得五体投地，并企图共同组织一个反共反人民的托派政党。
      勾结美帝
    梅龚彬说，1949年，陈铭枢从刚解放的上海来到北京，竟向周总理“献策”说，如果中共愿意与美国妥协，司徒雷登保证美国能援助中国多少美金。这说明陈铭枢为了满足他个人政治野心，竟想出卖国家和人民的利益。陈铭枢自称是孙中山先生革命主张的忠实拥护者，竟然甘作美帝走狗，衔司徒雷登之命来作说客，企图使中国人民重新沦为美帝殖民主义的奴隶。
    名为反蒋，实际反共；
    名为抗日，实际拥蒋
    梅龚彬说，从以上事实看，不要说陈铭枢今天侈谈拥护党的领导、拥护社会主义全是假的；就是解放前的反帝、抗日、反蒋也是盗名欺世。拆穿来讲，他是：名为反蒋，实际反共；名为抗日，实际拥蒋。事实如下：
      （一）约在“九一八”事变前夕，广州的西南军政委员会诸人共谋反蒋，当时陈是广东省主席，又掌握十九路军兵权，成为关键人物之一，而他却宁愿丢掉广东省主席，也不肯反蒋，竟然离开广东跑到日本去了。但后来何应钦电邀他回国，他则毫不迟疑地回来了，而且去江西充当剿共左翼军总司令（何应钦自任右翼军总司令）。
      （二）1933年，李济深和他、我都在香港，当时以福建十九路军为中心的反蒋计划在酝酿中，蒋介石的心腹、当时的浙江省主席黄绍竑突然到港，假说是与他共商反蒋大计，实则是衔蒋介石之命，来摸十九路军反蒋计划的底细，以便蒋介石知所应付。有一次，李济深、黄绍竑和他、我，乘汽轮到海上密商，很奇怪，他一开始就将十九路军全部反蒋计划（包括联合红军的计划）告黄，狡猾的黄绍竑假说：一旦十九路军进迫浙江边境，即在浙宣布独立来响应。黄探知内情后，回去一一告诉蒋介石。后来福建人民政府反蒋运动搞起来了，蒋介石调动主力部队自浙入闽，以迅雷不及掩耳的办法打击十九路军主力，福建人民政府革命运动之所以迅速失败，陈铭枢是要负重大责任的。
    （三）1936年陈自莫斯科回国，自谓对共产党所提“八一宣言”，表示接受。但是，1937年抗战开始，陈一到南京就利令智昏，迎合反动集团的意旨，创议解散民族革命同盟，并没有征得李济深等的同意，就独断专行地宣布同盟解散。
    揭发陈铭枢的丑恶历史，是为了使他认识错误的严重性
    梅龚彬最后说，我们原是不想算旧账的，如果解放以后，他能自己斩除过去一贯的政治野心，彻底认识过去的罪恶，老老实实跟着人民走，人民当然不再追究历史，我们也不必要再提往事。但事实并不如此。现在为着帮助他认识目前所犯错误的极端严重性，不能不追溯到思想根源，也不可避免地要联系到一些历史上的事实。这对他正视现在、明确将来方向，是大有裨益的事。
    陈铭枢拿着十九路军抗日旗帜欺骗人民
    吴茂荪在发言中，揭发了几件可以看穿陈铭枢真面目的事实。
    第一件事：1922年孙中山北伐，兵至韶关，陈铭枢当时是粤军第一师第四团的团长，竟通过黄居素勾结陈炯明叛变了，表现非常恶劣。中山先生非常痛恨他这种背叛行为。
    第二件事：陈铭枢一向是以抗日、反蒋为政治资本的。吴茂荪说，我今天要戳穿他的抗日、反蒋完全是假的。1931年冬，当时国民党内部矛盾非常剧烈，在上海举行了所谓宁粤和谈。那时大家说好蒋介石下野，十九路军调驻宁沪一带，由孙科任行政院长，组织政府。当时汪精卫曾称病住医院，忽然有一天出院去杭州会晤蒋介石。陈铭枢当时兼行政院副院长、交通部长和京沪卫戍总司令三要职，他在第二天由南京飞到杭州与蒋汪会晤。他以十九路军为资本，支持了蒋介石和汪精卫，孙科被迫下台。当时李济深在上海，本来预备去南京出任中央政治会议主席，参加反蒋的政府，结果因陈出卖而未去成。其后，在洛阳举行国难会议，陈铭枢在会上大谈蒋汪合作，共赴国难。请问陈铭枢是反蒋呢，还是拥蒋呢？
    吴茂荪说，至于说抗日，陈铭枢也是没有份的。“一·二八”十九路军淞沪抗日是中国人民一段英勇光荣的历史，蒋光鼐、蔡廷锴是当时全国景仰的英雄人物。而陈铭枢当时并不是真心抗日的。在“一·二八”的前夕，陈铭枢还打电话给蒋光鼐要他即刻去南京，对蒋光鼐说前方形势紧急不能去。当时谁都知道陈铭枢是想阻止十九路军同日本人正面冲突。洛阳会议后，陈铭枢由洛阳飞到真茹，散布了由孙希文起草的无耻的撤退宣言，他就这样地出卖了十九路军，讨好日本人，讨好蒋介石。请问陈铭枢，你是真抗日还是假抗日呢？假如你今天还妄想拿着十九路军抗日的旗帜来欺骗人民，十九路军阵亡将士的英灵也是不答应的！
    吴茂荪还举出了一些事实说明陈铭枢有篡夺民革领导权的野心，并且指出陈铭枢有更大的阴谋，在上海搞了一个小集团。关于这个小集团的情况，吴茂荪要求陈铭枢彻底交代。
    最后，吴茂荪说，从今天所揭发的材料来看，陈铭枢一贯的投机善变、反复无常，一贯的出卖革命、出卖朋友。解放前一二年，陈铭枢留在南京不愿去香港，为的是什么？据我分析，陈铭枢是想两面投机，一方面和民主党派联系，表示自己进步；另一方面又想以十九路军为资本，和蒋介石特务相勾结，企图出卖革命。由此可见，他的抗日、反蒋、反美全部都是假的，他勾结特务、勾结托派、勾结帝国主义、反共反人民反社会主义才是真的，他是一个反党反社会主义的右派野心家，我们必须在民革全体同志的面前，在全国人民的面前，剥开陈铭枢的面皮！
