Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 1st: "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper published a Damascus dispatch on June 29th, stating that the Jordanian government and the U.S. Ambassador in Amman are conspiring to entice 300,000 Arab refugees on the West Bank of the Jordan River to work on the Jordan Valley project in order to change their status.

The report said that the Jordanian government will collect the refugee certificates and employ them at a monthly salary of US$14.50 to work on this project. A committee composed of representatives from the Jordanian government and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has already been formed to persuade the refugees to hand over their refugee certificates. The report said that the U.S. government has promised to provide all necessary funds.

The refugees on the West Bank of the Jordan River are part of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homes by Israel during the 1948-1949 Palestine war. Arab countries have always insisted that Israel allow these refugees to return to their homes and provide compensation. Changing their refugee status means depriving them of their right to return home and obtain compensation. According to Western press reports, this measure jointly planned by the Jordanian government and the United States is part of a U.S. plot in the Middle East. The United States, together with some pro-Western Arab governments, believes that these refugees, who have strong anti-imperialist sentiments, are an obstacle to their policies. They have recently been in contact with each other, intending to eliminate this obstacle by relocating these refugees and changing their status. At the same time, the United States wants to use this to temporarily ease the contradictions between pro-Western Arab countries and Israel in order to strengthen the so-called "anti-communist front in the Middle East."

    美约策划流徙阿拉伯难民
    想骗取他们的难民证驱往约旦河谷
    据新华社开罗1日电　“共和国报”6月29日刊载大马士革消息说，约旦政府和美国驻安曼大使合谋，企图引诱约旦河西岸的三十万阿拉伯难民到约旦河谷工程去工作来改变他们的身份。
    消息说，约旦政府将收回难民证，以月薪美金十四元五角雇佣他们到这个工程去工作。已经由约旦政府和联合国近东巴勒斯坦难民救济及就业局派代表组成一个委员会去说服难民交出他们的难民证。消息说，美国政府答应供给一切必需的基金。
    约旦河西岸的难民是在1948—1949年巴勒斯坦战争中被以色列驱逐出家乡的阿拉伯难民的一部分。阿拉伯国家过去一向坚持要求以色列允许这些难民返回家乡并且给予赔偿。改变他们的难民身份意味着剥夺他们返回家园和取得赔偿的权利。据西方报界消息透露，约旦政府和美国共同策划的这个措施是美国对中东阴谋的一部分。美国同某些亲西方的阿拉伯国家政府认为，这些具有强烈反帝国主义情绪的难民是它们所推行的政策的障碍，最近它们已经进行接触，打算通过迁移这些难民以及改变他们身份的办法来消除这种障碍。同时，美国想借此暂时缓和亲西方的阿拉伯国家同以色列之间的矛盾，以加强所谓“中东的反共阵线”。
