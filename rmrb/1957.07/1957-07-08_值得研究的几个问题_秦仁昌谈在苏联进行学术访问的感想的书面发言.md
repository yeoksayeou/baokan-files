Comrade Mao Zedong’s speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" not only helped us to see things clearly but also clarified our country's path towards socialism. It also provided us with a powerful weapon to thoroughly crush the ambitions of right-wing elements. As a scientific worker, I do not want to be someone "without a correct political viewpoint, which is equivalent to being without a soul." I want to join all righteous scientists across the country in continuing to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen our communist worldview, and strive to build and defend the great socialist cause of our motherland.

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state's final accounts and budget, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan, as well as reports from other central leaders, I was excited to recognize the unprecedented and tremendous achievements made by the people of the whole country under the correct leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects of socialist transformation and socialist construction over the past year. These achievements could only be obtained under the leadership of the Communist Party. I fully agree with these reports and suggest that the congress adopt them.

In May of this year, Professor Hou Xueyu and I attended the Second Congress of the All-Union Botanical Society of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, we visited various places for academic exchanges. We personally felt the brotherly and warm reception and cordial conversations of the Soviet people, which gave us another lesson in internationalism. During our extensive contact with Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and Soviet scholars, we discovered the following issues, which we believe are worth considering by our cultural and educational departments and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I would like to present them here for everyone's guidance.

	Some Problems Among Our Students Studying in the Soviet Union

Our students studying in the Soviet Union are all working very hard, but as a result of the lack of comprehensive consideration in the past selection methods for students studying abroad, many students still have considerable difficulties in their studies. Due to poor Russian language and professional foundations, it is difficult to grasp some basic theories in the first one or two years. Some have suffered varying degrees of damage to their health due to excessive study pressure. Still others lack the basic conditions for cultivation. In particular, many graduate students who went to the Soviet Union after graduating from domestic universities, and a group of teachers from Chinese universities who were sent to the Soviet Union for short-term advanced studies in the autumn of 1956, face even more prominent difficulties in language. Some of these people are still studying Russian in their dormitory rooms, unable to attend classes and conduct research, let alone ask questions to their supervisors and conduct academic discussions, causing them great distress and putting them in a dilemma. Some even find it difficult to continue their studies, and even if they are forced to continue, I am afraid that they will not achieve much, which is a waste for the country. It is reported that the Ministry of Higher Education will improve the future selection methods for students studying abroad, which is completely necessary. However, the difficulties faced by many of the thousands of Chinese students currently studying in the Soviet Union, especially this group of advanced teachers, should not be ignored. We believe that based on each person's specific circumstances, those who have real difficulties or are in poor health and find it difficult to continue their studies should return to China early, which would be beneficial. On the other hand, university students who were selected from domestic middle schools to study at various Soviet universities and who have excellent graduation results should still stay in the Soviet Union to study as graduate students for another three to four years, in order to cultivate them into scientific workers with independent research capabilities and rapidly strengthen the ranks of our country's scientific work.

	The Relationship Between Universities and the Academy of Sciences

The relationship between Soviet universities, especially comprehensive universities (such as Moscow University and Leningrad University), and the Academy of Sciences is normal and does not have the kind of uncoordinated situation that currently exists between our Ministry of Higher Education and the Academy of Sciences. First of all, teaching and research in Soviet universities are completely integrated. The phenomenon of teachers not conducting research is extremely rare. Not only that, but professors with high academic reputations in universities are also researchers or directors of various research institutes of the Academy of Sciences. They make excellent arrangements for their time, generally working in the university's teaching and research office for two days a week, working in the Academy of Sciences' research institute for two days, and spending another two days at home writing research papers. At the same time, some senior researchers of the Academy of Sciences are either heads of university teaching and research offices or teach courses that universities cannot offer. Therefore, universities and research institutions cooperate closely and are integrated into one. The best graduates of comprehensive universities are transferred to the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences for training (after examination). Due to the requirements of the objective situation, the development of higher education in our country has been too fast in the past few years, and there are too many institutions. The scope of many majors is too broad (for example, there are biology departments in all fifteen comprehensive universities across the country, and the types of majors in each department are very similar), which has created a serious shortage of teachers in each major, as I mentioned in my speech at the Third Congress. In this situation, it is recommended that the Ministry of Higher Education cooperate closely with the Academy of Sciences and the research institutions of industrial departments to solve the current difficulties in the shortage of teachers and improve the quality of teaching.

The policy of learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms is completely correct and has also achieved results, but in the past, our country's learning from the Soviet Union has not been well integrated with our actual situation. Some have been blindly copied, and even slogans such as "package teaching" and "learn less, learn better" have been put forward, almost creating a phenomenon where teachers spoon-feed students. According to our understanding, such a teaching method does not exist in the Soviet Union, because such a teaching method will inevitably hinder young students from developing independent thinking abilities. It is said that many graduates who have been assigned to the Academy of Sciences in recent years are still unable to meet the requirements of their jobs. The visit of the Soviet Higher Education Delegation sent by the Ministry of Higher Education last winter was very timely, and I believe that a series of problems currently existing in our higher education can be gradually and reasonably resolved. I would also like to add that our country's situation is, after all, not completely the same as that of the Soviet Union. Their advanced experience can be used for our reference. Moreover, the Soviet Union's higher education system, professional settings, teaching plans, teaching outlines, etc., are constantly changing according to the development of the situation. Therefore, we must combine them with our country's actual situation and also listen to the opinions of veteran teachers, and carry out teaching reforms in a planned manner. This will surely achieve greater results.

	Regarding the Issue of Inviting Soviet Experts and Scholars to Our Country

In the eight years since liberation, many Soviet experts and scholars have been invited to our country. They have made great contributions to guiding our country's construction in various fields and have demonstrated a high degree of internationalist spirit, which is worthy of our admiration. However, we have treated them somewhat inappropriately. In conversations with some experts and scholars who have worked in our country during my time in the Soviet Union, they felt that it was inappropriate for our country's various departments to treat all experts and scholars who came to our country equally, regardless of their titles, academic degrees, and academic status in the Soviet Union, referring to them all as "experts" and providing them with almost equal material treatment. This is because in the Soviet Union, there is a distinction between experts and scholars, and they cannot be confused. The development of Soviet science is very rapid, and the division of disciplines is becoming increasingly detailed. In the past few years, the Soviet experts invited by the Ministry of Higher Education to give lectures in our country often did not carefully consider in advance whether their expertise was suitable for our country's work needs and whether the expected results could be achieved, nor did they fully utilize the role of the experts. It is recommended that in the future, when inviting Soviet experts and scholars, it would be best if Chinese scholars who are familiar with the Soviet academic community recommend them first, and then submit a list to the relevant Soviet departments for consultation before inviting them. This would be more appropriate.

	Recent Developments in the Soviet Academy of Sciences

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government have always attached importance to scientific research and entrusted the Academy of Sciences with the task of studying major scientific issues, especially exploratory theoretical research. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward an extremely important task for science, namely, to strengthen theoretical research in all scientific fields and to strengthen the connection between science and production. In order to complete this task, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Academy of Sciences plans to increase research in some marginal sciences and strengthen research in some weak basic disciplines. Seventy-eight new buildings will be built for research purposes, and special attention has been given to the development of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences.

	The Issue of Guaranteeing Scientists' Time

During the visit, we paid special attention to the issue of arranging the working hours of Soviet scientists and learned that their research time is guaranteed, and that each scientist's time arrangement is also diversified. For example, senior researchers of the Academy of Sciences generally work in the research institute for three to four days (mainly research work and philosophical study) and write papers at home for two to three days. Some directors of research institutes do research in the first half of the day and administrative work in the second half of the day, while others do administrative work in the morning and research in the afternoon. University professors also have three to four days a week for research, and the reasonable arrangement of research time for professors who work part-time at the Academy of Sciences has been mentioned above. Because time is guaranteed, Soviet scientists have achieved great success, and many scientists who are over fifty years old have become erudite scholars with "numerous works."

	Soviet Scientists Attach Great Importance to International Academic Activities and Private Contact Between Scientists

In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, scientific institutions, and scientists have all attached great importance to participating in international academic activities and strengthening private contact with foreign scientists to exchange academic experience. We were very surprised to see in the laboratories and homes of Soviet scientists many monographs that we have not seen in China since 1953, which were sent to them by scientists from Japan, India, Britain, the United States, France, and other countries that cannot be found in academic journals. Because science in all countries of the world is advancing rapidly, and new theories and technologies are constantly emerging, it is unimaginable to catch up with the advanced level of international science without first mastering international scientific research information.

	Soviet Scientists Raised Two Hopes for Chinese Scientists

(1) In order to have a better understanding of the achievements of the new China in science, they hope that Chinese scientists will attach a longer abstract in a foreign language (Russian, English, German, or French) to each paper. They have also begun to do so.

(2) Soviet scientists all hope to establish private contact with Chinese scientists to exchange publications and opinions on scientific issues.

Up to now, there has been very little private contact between botanists in China and the Soviet Union. They are very willing to establish direct relationships with Chinese botanists, whose country has the richest and most diverse flora in the world. I have been entrusted by the Soviet scientists I contacted this time to specially ask our country's scientific workers to consider this.

    值得研究的几个问题
    秦仁昌谈在苏联进行学术访问的感想的书面发言
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话，不仅帮助我们擦亮了眼睛，更明确的看清楚我们国家向社会主义前进的道路，而且给了我们彻底粉碎右派野心分子的有力武器。作为一个科学工作者，不愿意成为一个“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的人，我要同全国有正义的科学家一道，继续努力学习马列主义，加强共产主义世界观，为建设和保卫祖国伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
    我听了周恩来总理关于政府工作报告，李先念副总理关于国家决算预算报告，和薄一波副总理关于国家经济计划报告，以及其他中央领导人员的报告，兴奋地认识到一年来全国人民在共产党的正确领导下，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设各个方面的空前巨大的成就，这些成就只有在共产党领导下，才能获得。我完全同意这些报告，并且建议大会予以通过。
    今年五月我和侯学煜教授参加了苏联全苏植物学会第二次代表大会之后，我们曾到各地进行了一些学术访问活动，亲身感受到苏联人民对我们兄弟般的热情接待和亲切的交谈，使我们又受了一次国际主义教育。在我们和中国留学生及苏联学者们的广泛接触中，发现了如下几个问题，认为是值得我们文教部门和中国科学院考虑的，愿在这里提出来，请大家指教。我国留苏学生中的一些问题
    我国留苏学生都是很努力学习的，但由于过去选送留学生办法缺乏全面考虑的结果，现在许多留苏学生在学习上还存在着不少困难。由于俄文和专业基础差，在开始一二年内很难接受一些基本理论；有的由于学习过分紧张，健康受到不同程度的损伤；还有少数缺乏培养的基本条件，其中尤以许多在国内大学毕业后去苏的研究生和一九五六年秋派去苏联短期进修的一批我国高等学校教师在语言上的困难更为突出，这些人当中有些至今还在宿舍房间里自习俄文，不能进行听课和研究，更难向导师提出问题，进行学术讨论，弄得非常苦闷，进退两难；甚至有少数人在学习上有难以为继之势，就是免强学习下去，恐怕造就也不会很大的，这对国家是一种浪费。见报载高教部将改进今后选拔留学生办法，这是完全必要的。但对目前在苏联留学的几千中国学生中的不少人，特别是这一批进修教师的困难，也不应听其自然，置之不理。我们认为应该根据各人具体情况，凡确有困难或身体不好，难以继续学习的，应该提前回国，是有好处的。另一方面，过去由国内中学毕业后选送至苏联各高等学校学习的大学生，凡毕业成绩优良的，应该仍留苏当研究生，继续学习三年四载，以便培养成为具有独立研究能力的科学工作者，迅速壮大我国科学工作的队伍。
      高等学校与科学院之间的关系问题
    苏联高等学校，特别是综合大学（如莫斯科大学，列宁格勒大学）和科学院之间的关系是正常的，并没有如目前我国高教部与科学院之间那种不够协调的情况。首先，苏联高等学校内教学与研究是完全结合起来的，教师不进行研究的现象是绝无仅有的。不仅如此，凡高等学校里学术声望高的教授同时也是科学院各研究所的研究员或研究所所长，他们在时间上做了很好的安排，一般每周两天在学校教研室工作，两天在科学院研究所工作，还有两天在家里写作研究论文。同时，科学院的部分高级研究员或为大学教研室负责人，或担任一门大学不能开设的课程。因此，高等学校和研究机关是密切合作，融成一体的。综合大学最优秀毕业生才被输送到科学院的研究所去培养（经过考试）。由于客观形势的要求，过去几年我国高等教育发展的太快了一些，摊子太多了一些，许多专业的面铺得太广了一些（例如全国十五所综合大学内都有生物系，而各系的专业种类又是大同小异），形成了各专业师资不足的严重现象，这我在第三次大会上的发言已提过了。在这种情况下，建议高教部与科学院及产业部门的研究机构密切合作，以解决目前师资缺乏的困难和提高教学质量。
    学习苏联进行教学改革的方针是完全正确的，也是有成绩的，但过去我国学习苏联还未能很好地结合我国实际情况，有些生搬硬套，甚至还提出了“包教”，“学少一点，学好一点”等口号，几乎造成教师抱了学生学习的现象，这样的教学法，据我们了解在苏联是不存在的，因为这样的教学法势必阻碍青年学生养成独立思考能力。几年来分配到科学院的许多毕业生据说还不能适应工作的要求。高教部去冬派出的苏联高等教育访问团的访问，是十分及时的，相信对我国高等教育目前存在的一系列的问题，能逐步地得到合理的解决。还要补充一句，我国的情况，毕竟和苏联不完全相同，他们的先进经验，可以供我们的参考，何况苏联高等教育的学制，专业设置和教学计划，教学大纲等等，是根据形势的发展而不断改变的，所以我们必须结合我国实际情况，同时也要听取老教师的意见，有步骤的来进行教学改革，这样必将收效更大。
      关于聘请苏联专家学者来我国的问题
    解放后的八年内，聘请来我国的苏联专家学者很多，他们在指导我国各方面的建设事业，做出了很大的贡献，表示了高度的国际主义精神，是值得我们钦佩的，可是我们对待他们却有些不够恰当的地方。在苏联时曾和到过我国工作的一些专家学者们谈话中，他们对于我国各部门对所有来我国的专家学者一律平等看待，不管他们在苏联的职称、学衔、学术地位，一律称以“专家”，并在物质招待上也几乎一律平等的做法，认为是不恰当的，因为在苏联专家与学者是有区别的，不能混为一谈的。苏联科学事业的发展十分迅速，学科分工越来越细。几年来高教部聘请的苏联专家来我国讲学，事先既往往没有慎重考虑其专长是否适合我国工作上的需要，而能够达到预期的效果，也没有充分发挥专家的作用。建议今后聘请苏联专家学者时，事先最好能由熟悉苏联学术界情况的中国专门学者们推荐，再向苏联有关部门提出名单协商后聘请，这样较为妥善。
      苏联科学院的最近发展情况
    苏联共产党中央和政府一直重视科学研究，并且以重大科学问题的研究，尤其是探索性的理论研究交给科学院负担起来。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会给科学提出了一个极其重大的任务，即在所有的科学领域中加强理论性研究和加强科学与生产的联系。为了完成这个任务，在第六个五年计划时期内，苏联科学院计划增加一些边缘科学和加强一些基础薄弱学科的研究，要建筑七十八座新楼以供研究使用，对西伯利亚科学总分院的发展，已给予特别重视。
      科学家的时间保证问题
    在访问期中，我们特别注意了苏联科学家的工作时间的安排问题，了解了他们的研究时间是有保证的，而且每个科学家在时间安排上也是多样化的。例如科学院的高级研究员一般以三至四天在研究所工作（主要也是研究工作和哲学学习），以二至三天在家里写作论文。研究所的所长，有的早半天做研究，下半天办行政，有的早上办行政，下午作研究。高等学校教授的研究时间，每周也有三至四天，在科学院兼职的教授，他们的研究时间，上面已说过，也有合理的安排。正因为时间有了保证，苏联科学家的成就是大的，许多年满五十的科学家都已成为“著作等身”的硕学之士。
      苏联科学家非常重视国际学术活动和科学家之间的私人接触
    最近几年来，苏联共产党、政府、科学机构和科学家们都十分重视参加国际学术活动和加强同外国科学家之间的私人接触，交流学术经验。我们十分惊奇地在苏联科学家的研究室和他们家里看到我们在中国还没有看到的自一九五三年以来的许多日本、印度、英、美、法等国科学家送给他们的许多在学报上见不到的专著。因为世界各国的科学都在突飞猛进，新理论、新技术不断出现，要赶上国际科学先进水平，而不首先掌握国际有关的科学研究情报，是不可想像的。
      苏联科学家对中国科学家提出两个希望
      （1）为了对新中国科学上的成就有较多的了解，希望中国科学家在每篇论文后面附有较长的外文摘要（俄、英、德、法文均可）。他们也开始这样做了。
      （2）苏联科学家都希望同中国科学家建立私人接触，交换刊物和科学问题上的意见。
    到现在为止，中苏两国的植物学工作者之间的私人交道，还是很少，他们十分愿意和世界植物最丰富多采的中国的植物学家们建立直接关系。我受了这次所联系到的苏联科学家们的托付，特在此转请我国科学工作者们考虑。
