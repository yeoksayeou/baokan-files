Xinhua News Agency, July 19th, Cairo News: The Middle East News Agency reported on the 18th that the Egyptian government had uncovered a conspiracy in April to overthrow the current Egyptian government and assassinate President Nasser. Fourteen conspirators have been arrested, including two former ministers.
    The Middle East News Agency said that a group of retired military officers headed by Ahmed Atif Nasser colluded with Mohamed Salah el-Din and Abdel Fattah Hassan, leaders of the dissolved Wafd Party, in an attempt to launch an armed rebellion in the last week of April. They attempted to attack the Presidential Palace while the Egyptian cabinet was holding a meeting there, assassinate Egyptian President Nasser and all government ministers, seize power, and form a new government.
    The Middle East News Agency said that the conspirators intended to have Salah el-Din serve as the prime minister of the new government, and Hassan as the minister of the interior. Salah el-Din was the foreign minister of the Nahas government before the 1952 Egyptian revolution, and Hassan had served as the defense minister before the Egyptian revolution.
    The Middle East News Agency said that the conspirators confessed to their conspiracy during interrogation after their arrest. These people will be tried by a military court. A military court headed by Brigadier General Mohamed Fuad Digwi has been formed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 19th: Syrian authorities have uncovered a conspiracy directed by the Muslim Brotherhood of Jordan to assassinate a number of Syrian leaders.
    The conspiracy was to assassinate Syrian Defense Minister Azm; Foreign Minister Bitar; Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party leaders Hourani and Aflak; Minister of Public Works and leader of the National Party, Kayyali; and the General Secretary of the Syrian Communist Party, Bagdash, and others.
    The conspiracy also involved assassinating certain Syrian officers such as the director of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of Defense, Saraj, and abducting Jordanian officers seeking refuge in Syria.
    According to Damascus newspapers on July 18th, the Director of Public Security and Chief of Police, Ker Onataki, announced on July 17th: "Syria has handed over the conspirator Adib Dousouki to the Jordanian authorities, along with a recording of his confession."
    Adib Dousouki is a member of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. He was a Palestinian refugee who came to Syria from Jaffa in 1948 and settled in Damascus. Boxer Dousouki was hired by the Syrian Army to train the boxing team. Onataki said that Dousouki was a British spy.
    Onataki said that the Jordanian authorities sent Dousouki to Syria, ordering him to establish good relations with certain Syrian newspapers that supported the Jordanian authorities. The Jordanian authorities also ordered him to set up newspaper offices in Amman so that he could travel freely between Syria and Jordan. Onataki said that after Dousouki was arrested, he tried to deny it, but when we showed him the documents, he confessed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 20th: The "Guangming Daily" here published an editorial on the 19th, calling on the people to be vigilant against imperialist conspiracies, espionage, and all attempts at division and riots.
    The editorial said, "Imperialist elements and their agents have futilely used countless methods, including foreign political and economic pressure, to change Syria's prominent free and nationalist situation, and have tried to create an internal constitutional crisis." The newspaper also said, "Imperialism is not only using this method in Syria and opposing a specific group, but also using this method against any country that insists on defending its freedom and independence. They oppose every group that advocates national freedom, regardless of its philosophy or ideology."

    埃叙两国破获帝国主义奸细  暗杀犯和颠覆分子纷纷落网
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：据中东通讯社18日报道，埃及政府在今年4月间破获了一件企图推翻埃及现政府和谋杀纳赛尔总统的阴谋案。十四名阴谋分子已经被逮捕，其中包括两个前大臣。
    中东通讯社说，以艾哈迈德·阿蒂夫·纳赛尔为首的一批退职军官同已经被解散的华夫脱党领袖穆罕默德·赛拉哈丁和阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·哈桑勾结在一起，企图在今年4月的最后一星期进行武装暴动。他们企图乘埃及内阁在总统府举行会议的时候进攻总统府，杀害埃及总统纳赛尔和所有的政府部长，夺取政权，组织新政府。
    中东通讯社说，阴谋者企图让赛拉哈丁出来担任新政府的总理，哈桑任内政部长。赛拉哈丁是1952年埃及革命前纳哈斯政府的外交大臣，哈桑在埃及革命前曾经担任过国防大臣。
    中东通讯社说，阴谋分子被捕以后在侦讯中供认了他们的阴谋。这些人将由军事法庭审讯。一个以穆罕默德·弗德·迪格威准将为首的军事法庭已经组成。
    据新华社大马士革19日电　叙利亚当局破获了由约旦的穆斯林兄弟会所指挥的企图暗杀一批叙利亚领导人的一个阴谋。
    这个阴谋是要暗杀叙利亚国防部长阿泽姆；外交部长比塔尔；阿拉伯复兴社会党领袖胡拉尼；阿弗拉克；公共工程部长、国民党领袖卡雅利以及叙利亚共产党总书记巴格达什等。
    这个阴谋还要暗杀某些叙利亚军官如国防部第二局局长萨拉杰，并且要劫去在叙利亚避难的约旦军官。
    据大马士革报纸7月18日说，公安处兼警察处处长克尔·昂塔基7月17日宣布：“叙利亚已经把阴谋犯阿迪卜·杜苏基移交约旦当局，并且还附去他的供词录音。”
    阿迪卜·杜苏基是约旦穆斯林兄弟会的会员，他是1948年从雅法到叙利亚来定居在大马士革的巴勒斯坦难民。拳击家杜苏基曾被叙利亚陆军聘来训练拳击队。昂塔基说，杜苏基是英国间谍。
    昂塔基说，约旦当局派杜苏基到叙利亚，命令他与某些支持约旦当局的叙利亚报纸取得很好的联系。约旦当局还命令他在安曼设立报纸办事处，以便他能够自由地在叙利亚和约旦之间来往。昂塔基说，杜苏基被捕以后，还企图抵赖，但是当我们把文件给他看后，他就供认了。
    据新华社大马士革20日电　这里的“光明报”19日发表社论，要求人民警惕帝国主义的阴谋活动、间谍活动以及一切分裂和暴乱的企图。
    社论说，“帝国主义分子和他们的代理人徒劳地运用了包括外国政治和经济压力在内的无数办法，要来改变叙利亚突出的自由和民族主义的局面，而且试图造成内部的宪法危机”。这家报纸又说，“帝国主义不仅是在叙利亚采用这种手段和反对某一特定集团，而且对一切坚持保卫自己的自由和独立的任何国家都采取这种手段，它们反对每一个主张民族自由的集团，不论它的哲学或意识形态是什么。”
