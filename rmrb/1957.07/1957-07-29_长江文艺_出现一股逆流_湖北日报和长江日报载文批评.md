"Changjiang Wenyi" Shows a Countercurrent
Hubei Daily and Changjiang Daily Publish Articles Criticizing It

(Our Newspaper) News: Hubei Daily and Changjiang Daily on the 25th published articles criticizing the recent erroneous tendencies of "Changjiang Wenyi" (Yangtze Literature).

Hubei Daily published an article by Lin Po entitled "'Changjiang Wenyi': A Countercurrent," criticizing some erroneous articles in recent issues of "Changjiang Wenyi." The author wrote in this article: "The 'Literary Notes' column of 'Changjiang Wenyi' has almost become a forum for rightists. Some attack and insult the Party's literary cause, some pour cold water and smear it with black, and some shout to overthrow the three majorisms while aiming their fists at the leaders of the Party, creating a chaotic and noisy atmosphere." Then, he analyzed the erroneous arguments in articles such as "The Hierarchy in the Spiritual World," "Weapons That Stutter," and "Serving Whom Exactly?" recently published in "Changjiang Wenyi." He pointed out that the rightist Cheng Qianfan, using the pen name "Huichang," wrote "The Hierarchy in the Spiritual World," intentionally dividing literary workers into four classes: great writers and editors, small writers and editors, writers and editors who are neither great nor small, and authoritative writers and editors, believing that this kind of hierarchy "dominates our thinking activities" and is "advocated and tolerated." Furthermore, he said that those so-called high-level people are arrogant, engage in chaotic relationships between men and women, and prohibit readers from criticizing their works, while those so-called low-level people try every means to climb up, resulting in "literary success strategies" and "literary name lists," etc. Lin Po pointed out that this is a deliberate distortion and slander, consciously portraying the literary world as terribly bad and artificially creating division. The rightist Gu Xiuyun's article "Serving Whom Exactly?" published in "Changjiang Wenyi" essentially attacked the policy of literature "serving workers and production." Gu Xiuyun believed that literature serving workers is "untenable." He also slandered workers' literature as serving the personal "views" of certain leaders, rather than serving readers, attempting to obliterate the achievements of "Workers' Literature" published in Wuhan and condemn everything. Lin Po also pointed out that other articles in the "Literary Notes" column also had many errors, some exaggerating and distorting certain individual shortcomings, even distorting facts, painting the Wuhan literary world as completely dark; others using "depression" as the theme, inciting mass dissatisfaction, etc.

Changjiang Daily published three letters from readers criticizing the errors of "Changjiang Wenyi." Reader Xiaolin criticized the errors in Song Mouqi's "Weapons That Stutter" in the July issue of "Changjiang Wenyi." In the article, Song Mouqi fiercely attacked and criticized the comrades who criticized "Caomu Pian", while slandering the Communist Party and its leadership as "executioners."

When publishing the three letters from readers, Changjiang Daily also added an editor's note, expressing support for the readers' criticism. The editor's note pointed out: "Changjiang Wenyi" is one of the better large-scale literary publications in the country. However, since May, when rightists were frantically attacking the Party, "Changjiang Wenyi" also began to release a large number of poisonous weeds. In the miscellaneous essays, short essays, and literary notes columns, it has actually been controlled and utilized by rightists, becoming their position for attacking the Party and socialism. For example, "Weapons, Instruments of Torture, and Props" by Hui Chun in the May issue, "Let's Talk About 'Always Right'" by Jiang Hong in the June issue, "The Hierarchy in the Spiritual World" by Huichang (i.e., the rightist Cheng Qianfan) in the July issue, and "Serving Whom Exactly?" by the rightist Gu Xiuyun, etc., are all articles with toxins. More seriously, since the anti-rightist struggle began in June, "Changjiang Wenyi" has not yet taken action to counterattack the rightists. Instead, it has published more erroneous articles to continue attacking the Party. People can't help but suspect: Who is controlling these positions? It is hoped that "Changjiang Wenyi" can conduct a thorough investigation.

### “长江文艺”出现一股逆流  湖北日报和长江日报载文批评

    “长江文艺”出现一股逆流
    湖北日报和长江日报载文批评
    本报讯　25日的湖北日报和长江日报，载文批评“长江文艺”最近几个月来的错误倾向。
    湖北日报发表了林坡的题为“‘长江文艺’的一股逆流”一文，批评“长江文艺”最近几期的一些错误文章。作者在这篇文章中写道：“‘长江文艺’的‘文艺笔谈’专栏几乎变成了右派论坛，其中对党的文艺事业攻击谩骂者有之，泼冷水抹黑灰者有之，口喊打倒三大主义拳头却对准党的领导者有之，闹得乌烟瘴气，一片嘈音。”接着他分析了“长江文艺”最近几期刊登的“精神世界里的级别”、“吞吞吐吐的武器”和“究竟为谁服务”等文章的错误论点。他指出右派分子程千帆用“会昌”笔名写的“精神世界里的级别”一文，有意将文学工作者分为四等：大作家大编辑、小作家小编辑、不大不小的作家和编辑、权威作家权威编辑，认为这种级别论“支配着我们思维活动”，并且“被提倡，被容忍”。并且说，所谓级别高的人都是狂妄自大、乱搞男女关系，自己作品禁止读者批评等等，而所谓级别低的则想尽办法往上爬，于是出现了“文坛登龙术”和“文坛名单学”等等。林坡指出，这是别有用心的歪曲和毁谤，有意识把文艺界描写得糟糕透顶和人为地制造分裂。右派分子谷秀云在“长江文艺”上发表的“究竟为谁服务”一文，实质上是攻击文艺“为工人、为生产服务”的方针。谷秀云认为文艺为工人服务是“经不起推敲”的。并且污蔑工人文艺是为某些领导者的个人“看法”服务，而不是为读者服务，企图抹煞武汉出版的“工人文艺”的成绩，骂倒一切。林坡还指出“文艺笔谈”栏内另几篇文章也有许多错误，有的是抓住某些个别缺点加以渲染夸大，甚至歪曲事实，将武汉文艺界描绘得漆黑一团；有的是以“苦闷”为题，煽起群众不满等。
    长江日报刊登了三封批评“长江文艺”错误的读者来信。读者晓林批判“长江文艺”7月号宋谋瑒的“吞吞吐吐的武器”一文的错误。宋谋瑒在文章中大肆攻击批判“草木篇”的同志，同时他污蔑共产党和党的领导是“刽子手”。
    长江日报在登载三封读者来信时，还加了编者按语，表示支持读者的批评。编者按语中指出：“长江文艺”是办得较好的全国大型文学刊物之一。但从5月份以来，正当右派分子向党猖狂进攻时，“长江文艺”也开始放出大量的毒草。在杂文、短论和文艺笔谈等这几栏内，实际上已经为右派分子所把持和利用，成了他们向党向社会主义进攻的阵地。例如，5月号回春的“武器、刑具和道具”、6月号姜弘的“且说‘常有理’”、7月号会昌（即右派分子程千帆）的“精神世界里的级别”和右派分子谷秀云的“究竟为谁服务”等等，都是具有毒素的文章。更严重的是从6月份反右派斗争开展以来，“长江文艺”还没有行动起来，反击右派。反而发表了更多的错误文章继续向党进攻。人们不得不发生怀疑：究竟是谁把持了这些阵地。希望“长江文艺”能进行彻底检查。
