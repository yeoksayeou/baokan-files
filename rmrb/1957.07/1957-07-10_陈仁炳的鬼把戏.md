Chen Renbing's Tricks
Shanghai Peking Opera Company, Yan Huizhu

After reading the report published in the People's Daily on the first of this month exposing the criminal activities of the rightist Chen Renbing, I could not restrain my inner anger. The report said that Chen Renbing shamelessly posed as my "nanny" and used me to coerce leaders, saying something like, "If you don't arrange things well for Yan Huizhu, she will go crazy, she will run back to Hong Kong." I want to expose that this is a complete fabrication out of thin air by Chen Renbing. I have never been to Hong Kong, so how could I "run back"! Before liberation, several film companies invited me to Hong Kong to make films, but I didn't go; in the early days of liberation, several colleagues invited me to Hong Kong, but I also didn't go. After eight years of education by the Party, I have distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, recognized the two different paths of socialism and capitalism, and recognized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can opera art flourish with a hundred flowers. Why would I want to go to Hong Kong! This clearly reveals the anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership sentiments of the rightist Chen Renbing himself, and it is very likely that he attempted to instigate some people to go to Hong Kong. As for the arrangements made for me by Shanghai, I think they are very considerate. Over the past few years, the Party and administrative leaders have constantly helped and educated me, making me deeply feel the warmth of the Party. Therefore, I urgently request to improve myself politically and artistically, so as not to disappoint the Party's love and cultivation. As for the shortcomings in performance and other arrangements, I raised my opinions during the rectification campaign, and I will continue to raise them in the future if there are any. When I raised my opinions, perhaps my words were a bit激動(jīdòng - excited, agitated), sharper, even one-sided, and had errors, but they came from a pure heart of love for the Party. Unexpectedly, Chen Renbing put on a hypocritical face as if he were speaking out for me, but in his bones, he was peddling private goods to attack the Party, not hesitating to fabricate facts, falsely use my name, and sow discord between the Party leadership and the actors of the Shanghai Peking Opera Company. We Peking Opera actors have suffered the pain of poverty, oppression, and humiliation in the old society. In socialist society, our status has been improved, our lives are stable, and all conditions are superior. Comparing the past and the present, I dare say that any Peking Opera actor from the bottom of their heart will feel that socialist society is a thousand times, ten thousand times better than the old social system! Chen Renbing's divisive tricks are in vain!

I remember during the construction and study period of the Shanghai Peking Opera Company, Chen Renbing, as the deputy director of the Shanghai China Democratic League, conducted "individual visits" everywhere. We hoped that the China Democratic League would educate and help its members, but we never heard Chen Renbing offer any criticism of incorrect opinions. On the contrary, under the guise of "mutual supervision," he incited league members to be dissatisfied with the Party and instructed them to make their opinions as sharp and one-sided as possible. He sowed discord between Party members and non-Party members, leaders and the led, and even among league members themselves. This time when I left Shanghai to come to Beijing, on the day of my departure, Chen Renbing specifically told me that the situation at the Shanghai Peking Opera Company was really chaotic now and that the China Democratic League should help; he said that "a certain Party member leader has opinions about Wang Xichun," and also said that "the First Troupe cannot afford such a high salary for her, and after the performances are over, they will inevitably ask her to leave." He also煽動(shāndòng - incited, stirred up) by saying, "When the rectification campaign comes, these Party members should be好好地(hǎohāo de - properly, thoroughly) rectified, and they should be held accountable." Why did Chen Renbing tell me these things? Looking back now, it is clear that he was wearing the cloak of caring for actors and sympathizing with actors, attempting to arouse the actors' dissatisfaction with the leaders of the company. Under the leadership of the Party, the conspiracy of the rightists to狂猖(kuángchāng - rampantly, wildly) attack the Party has now been exposed, making this group of 跳梁小丑(tiàoliáng xiǎochǒu - jumping clowns, contemptible people) reveal their true colors, and also making me clear my eyes and recognize Chen Renbing's true face. I must raise my vigilance, stand firm, and draw a clear line between myself and the rightists! I want to loudly tell the rightists that we are resolutely taking the broad road of socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party!

    陈仁炳的鬼把戏
    上海京剧院　言慧珠
    读了本月一日人民日报刊登的，揭发右派分子陈仁炳罪恶活动的报道，我实在抑止不住内心的愤怒。报道中说，陈仁炳恬不知耻地以我的“保姆”自居，并且利用我来要挟领导，说什么“你们不安排好言慧珠，言慧珠会发疯，言慧珠要跑回香港去”。我要揭发：这彻头彻尾是陈仁炳无中生有的捏造。我从来没有到过香港，何言“跑回”！解放以前，有几家电影公司约我去港拍片，我未去；解放初期，有几个同事约我去港，我也未去。受了党八年教育，分清了敌我，认清了社会主义和资本主义两条不同的道路，认清了只有共产党领导，戏曲艺术才得百花齐放，为什么我要到香港去！这明明是透露了右派分子陈仁炳自己反社会主义、反对党的领导的心声，很可能是他企图鼓动一些人到香港去，说到上海方面对我的安排，我认为是很照顾的。几年来，党和行政领导经常的帮助和教育我，使我深切感到党的温暖，因此自己迫切要求在政治上和艺术上提高，以期不辜负党的爱护与培养。至于在演出等等部署方面存在缺点，我在整风中提过意见，以后如果有，也还要提。我提意见的时候，也许话说得激动些，尖锐些，甚至于片面，有错误，可是出自热爱党的一片赤心。想不到陈仁炳表面上摆出一副好像替我鸣不平的伪善面孔，骨子里却是贩卖向党进攻的私货，不惜捏造事实，假借名义，挑拨上海京剧院党的领导和演员之间的关系。我们京剧演员饱尝过旧社会贫困、压迫、污辱的痛苦，在社会主义社会里，地位提高了，生活安定了，一切条件都优越了，今昔相比，我敢说任何一个京剧演员打心里都会感到社会主义社会比旧的社会制度好一千倍，一万倍！陈仁炳的挑拨伎俩是徒劳的！
    记得在上海京剧院建院学习期间，陈仁炳以上海民盟副主任委员的身份，到处进行“个别访问”。我们希望民盟对自己的成员教育和帮助，可是我们却从来没听到陈仁炳对不正确的意见，提出过什么批评。相反，他竟在“互相监督”的幌子下，煽动盟员对党不满，指示盟员提意见要越尖锐越片面越好。他在党员与非党员之间，领导与被领导之间，乃至盟员彼此之间，挑拨离间。这次我离开上海来北京，动身的那天，陈仁炳还特地告诉我，上海京剧院现在情况真乱，要民盟来帮助；说“某党员领导同志对王熙春有意见，”又说“一团可出不起她这样高的薪水，将来演完了，势必请她走路”。还煽动地说：“等整风的时候，这些党员要好好地整一整，要向他们算算账。”陈仁炳为什么要把这些话对我讲呢，现在回想起来，明明是他披着关心演员、同情演员的外衣，企图激起演员对院领导的不满情绪。在党的领导下，现在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的阴谋揭发了，使这群跳梁小丑，原形毕露，也使我擦亮了眼睛，认清了陈仁炳的面目，我一定要提高警惕，站稳立场，同右派分子划清界线！我要大声告诉右派分子，我们坚决走共产党领导的社会主义的康庄大道！
