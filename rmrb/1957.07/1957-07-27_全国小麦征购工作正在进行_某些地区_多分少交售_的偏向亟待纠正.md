    National Wheat Procurement Work is Underway; The Tendency of "Distributing More and Selling Less" in Some Areas Needs to Be Corrected Urgently
    (This News) By July 10, the country had completed 34.81% of its wheat procurement task. Among them, the major wheat-producing areas of Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, Hebei, and Hubei provinces had completed 46.77% of the procurement task. Due to favorable weather conditions in most areas during the first half of the year, the quality of wheat stored in warehouses is better than last year.

    In some areas, the procurement tasks have been completed well due to the direct involvement of Party and government leading cadres, the correct implementation of the central government's instructions on summer grain distribution, and in-depth ideological education work. For example, in Caohe District, Ziyang County, Shandong Province, the procurement task was 2,404,000 jin. Warehousing began on June 18 and was completed by June 28. The amount of grain purchased by the state also accounted for 81.48% of the task, and it is expected to be overfulfilled.

    Currently, there are still some problems in the summer procurement work. The main problem is that some areas have poor political and ideological work and the policies are not explained in detail. As a result, township and commune cadres and members lack a correct understanding of the relationship between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members. Therefore, there are sharp contradictions in the distribution of procurement tasks and the amount of grain retained. Some commune cadres and members believe that "life should be improved after collectivization," and therefore have the idea of "distributing more and selling less." Some blindly raised the grain retention standards, and even refused to transport grain out of the area. Some adopted wrong practices such as distributing grain with large scales, over-deducting moisture content, and failing to record grain distribution in the books. Some agricultural cooperatives blindly developed sideline production using grain as raw materials, and even trafficked in grain. This has seriously affected the completion of the task of selling surplus grain. These practices, which disregard the needs of the state, need to be corrected urgently.

    It is understood that some grassroots cadres in some areas lack a correct understanding of the procurement work. They have not thoroughly publicized the policies, and some even have the passive idea of completing as much as they can. This situation should be given high priority by Party and government leaders at all levels. (Attached Picture)

### 全国小麦征购工作正在进行  某些地区“多分少交售”的偏向亟待纠正

    全国小麦征购工作正在进行
    某些地区“多分少交售”的偏向亟待纠正
    本报讯　截至7月10日止，全国已完成小麦征购任务34.81％，其中主要产麦区山东、河南、陕西、江苏、安徽、四川、河北、湖北等八个省，已完成征购任务的46.77％。由于今年上半年绝大部分地区风雨调和，入库小麦质量比去年好。
    部分地区由于党政领导干部亲自动手，正确贯彻了中央关于夏粮分配的指示，以及深入进行思想教育工作，因而征购任务完成较好。例如山东省滋阳县漕河区征购任务二百四十万四千斤，自6月18日开始入库，到28日止已全部完成；统购粮入库量也占任务的81.48％，预计可以超额完成。
    目前，夏征工作中还存在着一些问题。主要是有些地区政治思想工作差，政策交代不具体，以致乡、社干部和社员对国家、农业社、社员三者之间的关系缺乏正确的认识，因此在征购任务的分配和留粮数量上有了较尖锐矛盾。有些社干部和社员认为“合作化了，生活要提高”，因而存在着“多分少交售”的思想；有的盲目地提高了留粮标准，甚至拒绝粮食外运；有的采用大秤分粮，多折水分，以及分粮不记帐等错误作法；有的农业社盲目发展以粮食为原料的副业生产，甚至贩运粮食，这就严重地影响了余粮交售任务的完成。这些不顾国家需要的作法，亟待纠正。
    据了解，某些地区基层干部对征购工作缺乏正确的认识。他们没有深入地宣传政策，甚至有打算完成多少算多少的消极思想。这种情况应当引起各级党政领导的高度重视。（附图片）
