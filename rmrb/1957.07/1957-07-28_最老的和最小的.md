    The Oldest and the Youngest
    By our reporter Ai Ling
    Among the delegates attending the National Arts and Crafts Artists Representative Conference, the oldest and the youngest artists are particularly eye-catching. The older one is named Wei Yuantai, who is eighty-five years old this year and is the famous "Kite Wei" of Tianjin. The younger one is named Chen Chengpeng, who is only twenty-one years old this year and has made remarkable achievements in carving boxwood.
    "Kite Wei"
    In Tianjin, there is a kite shop where a group of children often gather in front of the door. Some want to buy, some are watching, and some are asking for repairs. Wei Yuantai always warmly satisfies the demands of his young customers. So the children especially like to buy his kites, and they affectionately call him "Grandpa Wei" and "Old Man Wei."
    The kites made by Wei Yuantai have a unique style, are exquisite and unique, and fly vividly and beautifully. They are very popular at home and abroad. Everyone, both children and adults, calls him "Kite Wei."
    Wei Yuantai became an apprentice at the age of sixteen. At that time, he learned to paste hard-winged swallows, butterflies, centipedes... which were rigid and inactive when flying. After completing his apprenticeship, he studied the principles of kites and researched flat-type and round three-dimensional types. Later, he created soft-winged, movable kites. In the long and difficult years, he dedicated his youth entirely to the craft of kites. However, the old era did not value his unique skills. Kites were only for the rich to appreciate and enjoy. The three months from the beginning of autumn to the beginning of winter each year were the peak sales season. After the beginning of winter, no one bought kites, so they had to make paper figurines as superstitious items to make a living. Only after liberation did the People's Government value his craftsmanship and open up sales channels for him. Now, the kites produced throughout the year are sold exclusively by the government, and most of the products are exported to earn foreign exchange. Since then, Wei Yuantai has been more focused on researching kites. The large kites he created, such as ten-foot-tall airplanes, birds, animals, and figures, can be folded up and packed in paper boxes, and some can even be packed in envelopes and mailed to other places.
    For more than sixty years, with a pair of ordinary hands and simple materials and tools, he has created countless beautiful kites. People like to watch the "Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers" kite the most. When the kite rises with the wind, the clouds under the feet of the heavenly maiden blend with the light blue sky, riding the clouds and mist, two wind belts flutter with the wind, and the colorful flowers are about to be scattered, just like a fairy descending to earth. Some kites also make a ringing sound with the wind, or rotate like a windmill.
    Wei Yuantai is also a kite-flying athlete who has won a "Gold Medal Award." But Old Wei said: "What's the use of a gold medal award? For decades, my family has been poorly clothed and fed. Only when the Communist Party came did we not have to worry about food and clothing and could live my old age well."
    Newly Opened Flowers
    Early in the morning, the rosy clouds rise, and the sea is glittering with gold. Young carving artist Chen Chengpeng sits on a stone, sometimes looking at the distance of the sea, and sometimes watching the fishermen's operations. Suddenly, a sea breeze blows, and the unbuttoned corner of a young fisherman's clothes is blown up, revealing his strong chest and a thick belt.... The fisherman's expression deeply attracts Chen Chengpeng. Based on this impression, he created the boxwood carving "Blowing the Conch." When this work was exhibited at this conference, it was praised by visitors.
    Chen Chengpeng also learns classical folk art techniques. In order to explore the emotional character of the characters, in addition to reading historical novels and ancient poems and studying the works of his predecessors, he also goes to ancient temples to see sculptures, visit exhibitions, watch operas.... Another work he created, "Writing Poems on Red Leaves," is very moving. A quiet boudoir sits under a maple tree, sighing with infinite tenderness about the deep autumn, a long and affectionate poem is about to be written on the maple leaf, giving people a real feeling.
    Chen Chengpeng has been learning carving with his father since he was a child. After graduating from elementary school, he was determined to devote his life to the carving career. Once, he carved a clay sculpture, and his father said with a smile: "This is neither a round sculpture nor a relief, and even the fingers are carved backwards!" The characters carved at that time were either too big in the head or too long in the hands and too short in the feet. He was a little discouraged. "Why does it seem easy to look at, but so difficult to do?" At this time, his father told him again: "The only trick for craftsmen is to work hard." Since then, he has not only studied extensive knowledge, learned Chinese painting, sketching, and even learned the proportions of human anatomy and art theory, but also constantly practiced. In the past eight years, he has created 50 works such as "Qin Xianglian," "Youth Survey Team," "Learning Culture," "Catching Butterflies While Picking Tea," "Fifteen Strings of Cash," and "Zheng Chenggong," and many of his works have been exhibited at provincial and municipal exhibitions.

    最老的和最小的
    本报记者　艾玲
    出席全国工艺美术艺人代表会议的代表中，引人注目的是一对年龄最老的和最小的艺人，老的名叫魏元泰，今年八十五岁，是天津市著名的“风筝魏”。小的叫陈程鹏，今年才二十一岁，在雕刻黄杨木上有着显著的成就。
    “风筝魏”
    天津市，有一家风筝铺，经常有一群小朋友围在门前，他们有的要买，有的在观看，也有的要求修理。魏元泰总是热情地满足小顾客们的要求。所以孩子们特别喜欢买他的风筝，他们亲切地称呼他“魏老爷爷”、“老公公”。
    魏元泰制造的风筝独具风格，精巧别致，放起来生动优美，国内国外都很受欢迎，不论小孩大人，都称他：“风筝魏”。
    魏元泰十六岁当学徒，当时学糊制的是硬翅的燕子、蝴蝶、蜈蚣……放起来死板，不活动。出师后，他才钻研风筝的原理，研究平拍类，圆型立体类，后来创造出软翅的能活动的风筝。在漫长的艰难岁月里，他将自己的青春全献给风筝这门工艺上。可是，旧时代并不重视他的独技，风筝只不过是给富人欣赏作乐罢了。每年立秋至立冬三个月是销售旺季，过了立冬之后，风筝就没人买了，他们只好做些纸扎人作迷信品来糊口。只有在解放以后，人民政府才重视他的工艺，给他打开销路，现在全年生产的风筝，由政府包销，大部产品出口换取外汇。从此，魏元泰更加专心研究风筝了。他创造的丈把高的飞机，鸟兽、人物……大型风筝，都可以折叠起来，装在纸盒里，有的还可以装在信封里寄往外地。
    六十多年来，凭着一双平凡的手，简单的材料、工具，创制出不知多少只美丽的风筝。人们最喜欢看“天女散花”风筝，当风筝随风升起来；天女足踏着的云彩和淡蓝色的高空相调和，腾云驾雾，两条风带随风飘舞，朵朵艳花将要散下来，俨如仙女下凡一样。有的风筝还会随风发出响铃声，或者像风车一样旋转。
    魏元泰还是一位得过“金牌奖”的放风筝的运动健将呢。可是魏老说：“金牌奖又有什么用？我几十年来一家人穿不暖吃不饱。只有共产党来了，才不愁吃不愁穿，好好地过我的晚年。”
    初开的花朵
    清晨，朝霞初升，海面上一片金辉闪闪。青年雕刻艺人陈程鹏坐在一块石头上，他时而眺望海的远处，时而看着渔民们的操作。忽然，吹来一阵海风，一个青年渔民没有扣钮的衣角被拂卷起来，露出健壮的胸脯和一条粗腰带……。渔民的这个神态，深深吸引住陈程鹏。他根据这个印象创作了黄杨木刻“吹海螺”。这一件作品，在这次大会上展出时，受到参观者的赞誉。
    陈程鹏也学习着古典民间的艺术手法。为了探求人物的感情性格，他除了读历史小说、古诗，研究先辈艺人作品外，还到古庙看塑像，参观展览会，看戏……。他创作另一件作品“红叶题诗”非常动人。一个淑静的宫闺，坐在枫树下，无限柔情地叹怨深秋，一首情意深长的诗句，正要提在枫叶上，给人以真实的感觉。
    陈程鹏从小就跟着父亲学雕刻。小学毕业后，他便决心毕生献身于雕刻事业。有一次，他刻了一个泥塑，父亲笑着说：“这既不是圆雕，也不像浮雕，连手指都刻反啦！”那时刻出的人物，不是头太大，就是手太长、脚太短。他有点泄气了。“怎么看起来容易，做起来这么困难？”这时父亲又告诉他：“做工艺的人，唯一的窍门就是下苦功”。从此，他一面学习广泛知识，学国画、写生，甚至学人体解剖比例、艺术理论，一面不断实践。八年来，他创作了“秦香莲”、“青年勘测队”、“学文化”、“采茶扑蝶”、“十五贯”、“郑成功”等作品五十件，不少作品曾在省市的展览会上展出。（附图片）
