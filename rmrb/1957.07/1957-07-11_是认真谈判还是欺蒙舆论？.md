Is it Sincere Negotiation or Deceptive Public Opinion?
By a staff commentator of this newspaper

	The dagger is revealed when the design is exposed. After three weeks of prevarication, the American representative to the London disarmament talks finally revealed the full extent of the American counter-proposals on the issue of halting nuclear weapons testing. It is now clearer what attitude the United States is taking on this important disarmament issue.

	This so-called new proposal, which has been clamored about for so long, is actually just a trick played by the United States that can be called a series of interconnected schemes. It ties a problem that is easy to solve to a series of tangled issues, expresses agreement “in principle” to stopping testing and using fissile materials for peaceful purposes, but adds vague conditions and uses endless platitudes to provoke endless disputes, thereby circumventing the resolution of key issues.

	Halting nuclear weapons testing is inherently simple and easy to implement. Public opinion in all countries unanimously hopes that an international agreement can be reached on this issue as soon as possible in order to eliminate the threat posed to mankind by atomic tests and to take a practical first step towards ultimately achieving comprehensive disarmament and a ban on nuclear weapons. However, the United States has consistently shown that it is unwilling to take this first step. In the proposal put forward by the United States, a large number of preconditions and reservations were set. These conditions and reservations make it impossible for the two sides to reach an effective agreement. For example, the Soviet Union advocates reaching a separate agreement on the cessation of testing as soon as possible. But the United States demands that the cessation of testing be linked to reaching the first stage of agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments. As everyone knows, on the issue of reducing conventional armaments, the United States insists that any preliminary agreement must be accompanied by aerial inspection; and on the issue of aerial inspection, the United States emphasizes that any agreement must first be approved by its relevant Western European "allies." This greatly complicates the problem.

	To further complicate the issue of stopping nuclear testing, the U.S. proposal also insists that the cessation of nuclear testing must be accompanied by the cessation of the production of fissile materials for military purposes. At first glance, it seems that the United States is willing to go further on this issue. But behind these high-sounding "proposals" lies a great deal more. Although the United States talks glibly about stopping the production of fissile materials for military purposes, it makes important reservations. First, the United States cannot agree to a complete ban on the use of nuclear weapons, and demands that the disarmament agreement explicitly stipulate that nuclear weapons can be used when necessary, in an attempt to legalize the use of nuclear weapons. Second, when the production of fissile materials for military purposes is stopped, countries that have already begun to manufacture nuclear weapons should still be allowed to complete their manufacture. Third, after production is stopped, the United States has the right to continue to "remodel" existing nuclear weapons. Fourth, the agreement will "not prevent" the United States from training troops from other countries to use and launch nuclear weapons, nor will it "prevent" the United States from "placing" nuclear weapons in other countries. This means that the United States can agree to reach an agreement to stop nuclear testing, and even agree to stop production, but it will continue the production it has already started, continue to develop nuclear weapons under the guise of "remodeling", and can openly use nuclear weapons to threaten and prepare for nuclear war. These reservations would render any agreement meaningless.

	Not only that, but after making such a large number of reservations, the so-called "concessions" made by the United States itself are only to agree to stop testing for ten months. In the words of the American newspapers, this is exactly the time that the United States needs to prepare for a test. This shows that the United States has been feigning for a long time, but in fact it is unwilling to even temporarily stop nuclear weapons testing, let alone ban the use of nuclear weapons and eliminate existing nuclear weapons from armaments. And these two points are the best guarantee for eliminating the increasing threat of nuclear weapons to the world.

	Recently, the pressure from public opinion in various countries demanding an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing has become increasingly strong. More and more people in the United States are also demanding that the U.S. government change its attitude. Even in the U.S. House of Representatives, there are members who have introduced bills requiring the government to stop nuclear weapons testing. Under these circumstances, the warmongering groups in power in the United States, on the one hand, continue to adhere to their die-hard policy of opposing any disarmament agreement, and are stepping up the implementation of their new war preparation plan centered on the development of nuclear weapons. But on the other hand, they want to pretend to be peace envoys at the negotiating table, posing as willing to reach an agreement, deceiving world public opinion, which cannot but make them contradict themselves and make a fool of themselves.

	American columnist Walter Lippmann described in the "Washington Post" that in the past few weeks, the U.S. authorities "seem to be a person who is talking to himself and thinking about what to do, rather than a politician who holds a policy." In fact, the problem is not that Washington does not have a policy, but that this policy is unsightly and cannot be brought to the table, so it has to be constantly changed to escape the condemnation of the international public. But as Lippmann admits, the clumsy methods used by the U.S. government can only "invite responsibility for blocking the road to reaching an arms limitation agreement."

    是认真谈判还是欺蒙舆论？
    本报评论员
    图穹见匕首。参加伦敦裁军谈判的美国代表在吞吞吐吐三个星期之后，终于把美国关于停止核武器试验问题的反建议全部亮出来了。现在可以更清楚地看出：美国在这个有关裁军的重要问题上采取的是什么态度。
    这个喧嚷了很久的所谓新建议，实际上只是美国玩弄的可以叫作连环套的诡计。它把一个本来容易解决的问题，同一连串纠缠不清的问题套在一起，“原则上”表示赞同停止试验和把裂变物质用于和平目的，但是又加上了措辞含糊的种种条件，用漫无边际的空谈来引起无休止的争执，从而规避关键问题的解决。
    停止核武器试验本来是简便易行的。各国舆论一致地希望早日在这方面达成一个国际协议，以便解除原子核试验给人类带来的威胁，并且向最后达成全面裁军和禁止核武器的协议跨出实际的第一步。但是，美国却表现出来始终不愿从这个起跑点举步。在美国提出的建议中，安置了一大堆先决条件和保留。这些条件和保留使得双方无法达成有效的协议。例如，苏联主张迅速就停止试验问题单独达成协议。但是美国却要求把停止试验和达成裁减常规军备的第一阶段协议连在一起。大家知道，在裁减常规军备问题上，美国坚持任何初步协议都必须附以空中视察；而在空中视察问题上，美国又强调任何协议必须先得到它的有关的西欧“盟国”的同意。这样就使得问题大大地复杂起来。
    为了使停止核试验的问题进一步复杂化，美国建议中还坚持停止核试验必须同时停止军用裂变物质的生产。乍一听来，美国好像在这个问题上愿意走得更远些。可是在这些冠冕堂皇的“建议”后面，还大有文章哩。美国虽侈谈停止军用裂变物质的生产，却作了重要的保留。第一，美国不能同意完全禁止使用核武器，而且要求在裁军协议中明文规定必要时可以使用核武器，企图变使用核武器为合法化；第二，在停止军用裂变物质生产的时候，仍要允许那些已经开始制造核武器的国家完成其制造；第三，在停止生产以后，美国有权继续“改造”现有的核武器；第四，协议将“不阻止”美国去训练其他国家的部队使用和发射核武器，也“不阻止”美国在其他国家“放置”核武器。这就是说，美国可以同意达成停止核试验的协议，甚至同意停止制造，但是它将继续它已经开始的生产，以“改造”为名继续发展核武器，并且可以公开拿核武器进行威胁和准备核武器战争。这种保留使得任何协议都将成为没有实际意义的东西。
    不但这样，美国在提了这么一大堆保留之后，它自己作出的所谓“让步”，不过是同意停止试验十个月。用美国报纸的话来说，这正好是美国为了准备一次试验所需要的时间。这就表明美国装腔作势了许久，事实上连暂时停止核武器试验也不愿意，更不用说禁止使用核武器和从军备中消除已有的核武器了。而这两点正是消除世界所受到的日益增加的核武器威胁的最好保证。
    最近一个时期，各国舆论要求立即停止核武器试验的压力是越来越强大了。美国国内也有越来越多的人要求美国政府改变态度。甚至在美国众议院里，也有议员提出了要求政府停止核武器试验的法案。在这种情况下，美国当权的好战集团，一方面继续坚持它的反对达成任何裁军协议的死硬政策，并且正在加紧实行它的以发展核武器为中心的新的备战计划。但是另一方面却要在谈判桌上伪装和平使者，摆出愿意达成协议的姿态，欺骗世界舆论，这就不能不使得它自己自相矛盾，丑态百出。
    美国专栏作家李普曼在“华盛顿邮报”上描绘说，在过去几周，美国当局“好像是一个正在自言自语地筹思、不知怎办才好的人，而不像一个握有政策的政治家”。其实，问题绝不是华盛顿没有政策，而是因为这种政策见不得人，拿不到桌面上来，因此不得不不断改头换面，以躲避国际公众的谴责。可是正如李普曼所承认的，美国政府所使用的拙劣手法，只能“为自己招来堵塞达成限制军备协议的道路的责任”。
