    U.S., French and West German Authorities
    Obstruct Youth Participation in Festival
    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th - U.S., French, and West German authorities are obstructing youth representatives from going to the Soviet Union to participate in the Sixth World Youth Festival.
    It is reported that the U.S. State Department has so far not allowed an official delegation to participate in the festival. The management of the French National Railway Company not only rejected the festival committee's application to allocate special carriages to transport representatives, but also forbade Czechoslovakia from sending special carriages to France to pick up French representatives.
    The West German police authorities are also persecuting members of the West German Preparatory Committee for the festival. The residences of many committee members, including Professor Aufhäuser of the Theological Department of the University of Munich, and journalist Reder, have been searched. The "case investigation" of Professor Schneider, chairman of the committee, has also begun. In recent days, letters sent to him have been detained by the police. The police authorities have also confiscated the funds deposited by the committee in the Bavarian State Bank.

    美、法和西德当局
    阻挠青年参加联欢节
    据新华社19日讯  美、法、西德等国当局阻挠青年代表去苏联参加第六届世界青年联欢节。
    据悉，美国国务院到现在一直不允许派正式代表团参加联欢节。法国全国铁路公司管理处不仅拒绝联欢节委员会提出的拨专车载送代表的申请，而且不准捷克斯洛伐克派专车到法国来接法国代表。
    西德警察当局还对联欢节西德筹备委员会的委员进行迫害。许多委员的住宅，包括慕尼黑大学神学系教授奥夫豪泽尔、记者雷德尔等人的住宅都受到搜查。对委员会主席施奈德教授的“案件侦查”也开始了。最近几天人家寄给他的信件都被警察扣留了。警察当局还没收了这个委员会存入巴伐利亚国家银行的经费。
