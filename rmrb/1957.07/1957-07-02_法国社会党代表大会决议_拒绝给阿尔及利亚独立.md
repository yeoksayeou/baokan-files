Xinhua News Agency, July 1st Dispatch from Paris: The 49th National Congress of the French Socialist Party, which opened in Toulouse on June 27th, concluded on June 30th. After fierce debate, the congress passed a resolution refusing to grant Algeria independence, insisting that Algeria should be regarded as an "inseparable" part of France. This resolution was fully supported by the Socialist Party Secretary-General and former Prime Minister, Mollet.

The Algerian policy was the central focus of discussion at this congress. During the preparation period for the congress, the sentiment among the vast majority of ordinary Socialist Party members against the "appeasement" policy in Algeria strengthened.

The congress was conducted in a very tense atmosphere. Three different draft resolutions were proposed on this issue. The resolution proposed by the Party Secretariat, signed by Socialist Party Deputy Secretary-General Commin, approved of the current suppression policy in Algeria and advocated continuing this policy in order to maintain the "inseparable link" between Algeria and France. The second resolution was proposed by Depreux, Mayer, Vedier, and others. This resolution condemned the "appeasement" policy and suggested negotiations with Algerian plenipotentiaries based on recognition of Algeria's national characteristics and aspirations. The third resolution was proposed by the Bouches-du-Rhône Socialist Party Provincial Committee, led by former Overseas Minister Defferre. The resolution condemned the government's policy, considering it dangerous, but rejected the principle of Algerian national independence. Defferre suggested conducting secret negotiations on ceasefire conditions.

During the discussion process, many representatives who spoke demanded an immediate abandonment of the policy that has plunged France and the Socialist Party into a difficult position on the Algerian issue, and has condoned fascist elements and colonialists in carrying out subversive activities, thereby endangering the French republican system.

    法国社会党代表大会决议
    拒绝给阿尔及利亚独立
    据新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：6月27日在都鲁斯开幕的法国社会党第四十九次全国代表大会已经在30日结束。大会经过剧烈的争论以后，通过了一项决议，拒绝给阿尔及利亚以独立，坚持应该把阿尔及利亚当作法国“不可分割的”一部分。这个决议受到社会党总书记、前总理摩勒的全力支持。
    阿尔及利亚政策是这次大会的讨论中心。在大会筹备期间，社会党广大普通党员反对在阿尔及利亚的“绥靖”政策的情绪加强了。
    大会是在非常紧张的气氛下进行的。大会上就这个问题提出三个不同的决议草案。由社会党副总书记戈曼签名的党书记处提出的决议案赞成目前在阿尔及利亚的镇压政策，并且主张继续这种政策，以便保持阿尔及利亚同法国之间“不可分割的联系”。第二个决议案是德普勒、麦耶、维迪埃等人提出的。这个决议案谴责“绥靖”政策，建议在承认阿尔及利亚民族特点和愿望的基础上，同阿尔及利亚的全权代表进行谈判。第三个决议案是以前海外部部长德费尔为首的罗尼河口省社会党省委会提出的。决议案谴责政府的政策，认为这个政策有危险性，但是拒绝阿尔及利亚民族独立的原则。德费尔建议就停火条件进行秘密谈判。
    在讨论过程中，发言的很多代表都要求立刻放弃使法国和社会党在阿尔及利亚问题上陷于困境，并且纵容法西斯分子和殖民主义者进行颠复活动，从而危及法国共和制度的政策。
