Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 5th: Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 has recently trial-produced a fabric called glass yarn, which has been praised by people in the textile industry. This new fabric is woven with eighty-count double-strand cotton yarn as thin as hair. It is thin and transparent with stripes. When placed over a book, people can clearly see the words. It is an ideal summer clothing material for people in tropical and subtropical regions.

This is just one of more than 100 new products produced by Shanghai's cotton textile industry in the first half of this year. The total number of new products produced by the factories in the first half of the year is about half more than the planned number.

    玻璃纱
    热带理想的夏季衣料
    据新华社上海5日电　上海国棉二厂最近试制出一种名为玻璃纱的织物，受到纺织界人士的赞赏。这种新织物是用像头发样细的八十支双股棉纱织的，薄而透明，带有条纹，蒙在书上，人可以清楚地看出字迹，是热带和亚热带地区人们理想的夏季衣料。
    这只是上海棉纺织工业今年上半年出产的一百多种新产品中的一种。这半年各厂出产新产品的总数大约比计划数多一半。
