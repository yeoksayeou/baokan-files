    Henan Province Universally Promotes Decentralized Breeding of Draft Animals
    Abnormal Deaths and Weakness Basically Reversed

    (Our Dispatch) By the end of May, in Henan Province, over 50% of draft animals were being raised by individual teams or households. The phenomenon of abnormal deaths of draft animals has basically ceased, and the number of weak draft animals has decreased from 30% to 15%.

    Since 1954, the number of draft animals in Henan Province has not only failed to increase but has actually decreased. The situation was particularly serious in 1956, with a net decrease of 620,000 head of draft animals for the entire year. The situation did not improve in January and February of this year, resulting in a general shortage of draft animals in rural areas.

    Why have draft animals decreased in Henan Province over the past two years? There are many reasons. The main reason is that during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of centralized feeding of draft animals in large troughs. Because the new cooperatives lacked experience in centralized feeding, rational solutions were not promptly found in the selection of feeders, the preparation of feed and fodder, and the establishment of methods of utilization, resulting in the weakness and death of draft animals.

    However, the method of decentralized feeding avoids the aforementioned shortcomings. Xuchang Prefecture also created four good experiences in promoting decentralized breeding of draft animals: good ideological mobilization, well-established systems, good classification and team allocation of draft animals, and well-prepared housing and tools. As of late June, Xinyang Prefecture in Henan Province had adopted decentralized feeding methods for 80.25% of its draft animals. This not only quickly stopped the abnormal deaths of livestock, but also significantly improved the physical strength and condition of the livestock; the number of draft animals for mating and breeding has also gradually increased. According to statistics from the whole region on June 20, the number of livestock in full condition rose from more than 280,000 in April to more than 430,000, accounting for over 43% of the total number of livestock in the region. While adopting decentralized feeding, the entire prefecture, through mass discussions, purged more than 4,200 landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements from the ranks of feeders; and replaced more than 25,000 incompetent feeders (such as children and idlers); many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members served as feeders. According to a survey of 24 townships in Wuyang County, out of 32,000 draft animals, 5,533 died last year due to centralized feeding (some of which were old, weak, or disabled); according to a survey of 29 townships in the county, out of 31,000 draft animals, only 130 died last year because most of them were raised in a decentralized manner, and most of them were old, weak, or disabled. In 1956, the number of draft animals in Lushi County increased by 16.5% compared with 1955, mainly because the draft animals were distributed to production teams and raised by dedicated personnel in separate teams.

    In February of this year, the Rural Work Conference of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China determined the policy of decentralized feeding of draft animals and the integration of raising and utilization, and focused on promoting the feeding experience of Yangdian Township in Suiping County. The draft animals of the Pioneer First, Second, and Third agricultural production cooperatives in this township were not well managed in the spring of 1956. However, after discussions among the cooperative members, 52 loyal and reliable members with certain experience in raising draft animals were selected to serve as feeders, and the methods of dedicated responsibility, small trough separate team feeding, and self-feeding and self-feeding to the end were implemented, strengthening the feeders' sense of responsibility. At the same time, a reward system was implemented for mating and breeding draft animals. As a result, the number of large and small draft animals in these three cooperatives increased by 12.1% compared with last spring, and many draft animals gained weight.

    At present, the vast majority of areas in Henan Province are actively implementing the policy of decentralized feeding of draft animals.

    河南省普遍推广耕畜分散饲养
    非正常死亡和瘦弱现象基本扭转
    本报讯　截至5月底，河南全省耕畜实行分犋、分户饲养的占耕畜总数的50％以上，过去耕畜非正常死亡的现象基本上停止，瘦弱的耕畜已由30％下降到15％。
    从1954年以来，河南省耕畜不但没有增加，而且下降了。特别是1956年更为严重，全年耕畜生死相抵，减少了六十二万头。今年1、2月份情况并未好转，造成农村耕畜普遍不足。
    近两年来，河南省耕畜为什么会减少？原因是多方面的。主要的是在农业合作化高潮中，绝大部分农业社采用了耕畜集中大槽饲养的办法。由于新社没有集中饲养的经验，在饲养员的选择上，饲料、饲草的准备上，使役办法的规定上，都没有能及时得到合理解决，因此造成耕畜瘦弱和死亡。
    但是采用分散饲养的办法就避免了上述的那些缺点。许昌专区，在推广耕畜分散饲养中，还创造了四好经验，即思想发动好、各种制度订好、耕畜分类站队配犋好，房子工具准备好等。河南省信阳专区截至6月下旬，已有80.25％的耕畜采用了分散喂养的方法。这不但迅速的制止了牲畜的非正常死亡现象，而且牲畜的体力膘情有显著的好转；配种、繁殖的耕畜也逐渐增多。全区6月20日的统计，满膘牲畜由4月份的二十八万多头，上升到现在的四十三万多头，占全区牲畜总数的43％强。在采用分散喂养的同时，全专区通过群众讨论，清除了地主、富农成份和反革命分子的饲养员四千二百多名；并调换了不称职的饲养员（如小孩、二流子等）二万五千多名；许多共产党员和共青团员担任了饲养员。据舞阳县二十四个乡的调查，有耕畜三万二千头，由于是集中饲养，去年一年中死了五千五百三十三头（其中有老弱、残废）；另据该县二十九个乡的调查，有耕畜三万一千头，由于大部分采用了分散饲养的方法，去年一年只死亡了一百三十头，并且大部分是老弱、残废。卢氏县1956年比1955年耕畜增加16.5％，主要是由于把耕畜分散在生产小组，并有专人分犋饲养。
    今年2月，中共河南省委农村工作会议确定了耕畜分散饲养和养用合一的方针，并着重推广了遂平县杨店乡的饲养经验。这个乡的先锋第一、二、三，三个农业生产合作社耕畜，在1956年春天饲养管理的并不好。但经过社员们讨论，调选了五十二个忠诚可靠和有一定饲养耕畜经验的社员充当了饲养员，实行了专人负责，小槽分犋饲养，自使自喂包干到底的办法，加强了饲养员责任心。同时，对耕畜配种繁殖实行了奖励制度。因此，这三个社大小耕畜比去年春天增加12.1％，不少耕畜长了膘。
    目前，河南省绝大部分地区都在积极执行分散喂养耕畜的方针。
