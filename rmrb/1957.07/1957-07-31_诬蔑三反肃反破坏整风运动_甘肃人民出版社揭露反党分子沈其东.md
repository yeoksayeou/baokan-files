Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 30th: In the anti-rightist struggle, the Gansu People's Publishing House exposed the crimes of Shen Qidong, who had infiltrated the Party for nineteen years and was the acting director of the publishing house's editorial department, in his consistent and rampant attacks against the Party.

Shen Qidong consistently harbored animosity towards the Party and opposed the Party's leadership. He once slandered the great Three-Anti Movement and arrogantly wrote a letter to the Party Committee, questioning why the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao "did not conduct self-criticism." He once disparaged the Anti-Rightist campaign as being "excessive." Not long ago, he wrote an article arguing that the root cause of the "formation" of contradictions between commune members and commune cadres was that the commune cadres "joined the Party." He deliberately tampered with the formula for handling contradictions among the people, changing it to "criticism - unity - criticism."

Shen Qidong openly opposed the Party's leadership over the publishing industry, saying at the publishing house's rectification leadership group meeting: "The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department do not understand the publishing business and cannot lead the publishing house."

In the early stages of the rectification movement, Shen Qidong, in his capacity as a leader of the rectification group, openly put forward the inflammatory slogan "Vent your anger, exert your strength" at meetings, and actively engaged in activities outside the meetings, using various opportunities and methods to stir up trouble everywhere. Under his instructions, his wife, the rightist element Yuan Ye, posted many big-character posters maliciously attacking the Party in rapid succession under different pseudonyms in just a few days.

    诬蔑三反肃反破坏整风运动
    甘肃人民出版社揭露反党分子沈其东
    据新华社兰州30日电　甘肃省人民出版社在反右派斗争中揭露了混入党内十九年、出版社编辑部代理主任沈其东一贯向党猖狂进攻的罪行。
    沈其东一贯敌视党，反对党的领导。他曾诬蔑伟大的三反运动，并且狂妄地向党委上书，质问党中央和毛主席“为什么不作检讨”。他曾经诋毁肃反搞得“过火”。不久前，他写了一篇文章，认为“形成”社员和社干部的矛盾的根源，是社干部“入了党”。他故意篡改处理人民内部矛盾的公式为“批评——团结——批评”。
    沈其东露骨地反对党对出版事业的领导，在该社整风领导小组会议上说：“省委和省委宣传部不懂出版业务，不能领导出版社”。
    在整风初期，沈其东以整风小组领导人的身分，在会议上公然提出“有气出气，有力出力”煽动性的口号，并在会外大肆活动，利用各种机会和方式，到处点火。在他的指示下，他的妻子、右派分子苑野，在短短的几天中，以不同的化名接二连三地贴出了许多恶意向党攻击的大字报。
