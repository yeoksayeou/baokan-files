Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 15th. Indonesian Foreign Ministry Spokesman and newly appointed Acting Secretary-General Suwito Kusumowidagdo told Antara News Agency reporters today that the Dutch government's inclusion of West Irian, Indonesian territory, into the "Common Market" organized by Western European countries, and its intention to undertake joint investment and resource development there, is, in effect, a revival of its former colonial policy towards Indonesia.

Suwito said that the implementation of this colonial policy could even develop into a form of collective colonial rule.

Suwito expressed his hope that those countries participating in the European "Common Market" that have good relations with Indonesia would be able to appreciate this point and avoid causing political disputes that everyone hopes to avoid.

    印度尼西亚外交部发言人
    指责荷兰把西伊里安划入欧洲“共同市场”
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人、新任代理秘书长苏维托·库索莫维达格多今天对安塔拉通讯社记者说，荷兰政府把印度尼西亚领土西伊里安划入西欧国家所组织的“共同市场”，并且预定在那里采取共同投资开发资源的行动，这实际上是恢复它从前对印度尼西亚的殖民政策。
    苏维托说，这种殖民政策的执行甚至有可能发展为集体殖民统治的形式。
    苏维托表示希望那些参加欧洲“共同市场”而同印度尼西亚有着良好关系的国家能够估计到这一点，并且避免引起大家所不希望的政治纠纷。
