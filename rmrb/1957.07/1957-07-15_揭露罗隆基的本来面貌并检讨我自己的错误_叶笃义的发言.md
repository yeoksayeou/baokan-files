I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports.

Premier Zhou's report stated: "We must draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements politically and ideologically, and carry out necessary and resolute struggles against such people, so that the vast majority of truly patriotic people recognize the errors of the right-wing elements' position and behavior." I am willing to expose here Luo Longji's historical true colors and his consistent anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Talking about Luo Longji

Luo Longji's current anti-Party and anti-socialist activities are not accidental, but have their historical roots.

First, Luo Longji is a person without national integrity who will do anything.

During the period from 1935 to 1937, the national anti-Japanese salvation movement was surging, and the historically significant great "December 9th" and "December 16th" student movements broke out in Tianjin and Beijing. At that time, Luo Longji participated in Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun's reactionary National Socialist Party, and presided over the Tianjin Yishibao and the Beijing Chenbao. His newspapers not only did not support the patriotic anti-Japanese movement, but instead put forward the strange argument that "the South can talk about resisting Japan, but the North can only talk about anti-Chiang." At that time, it was the so-called "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" of Song Zheyuan that ruled Tianjin and Beijing, which was a semi-traitorous regime. Luo Longji's so-called "anti-Chiang in the North" was essentially echoing the slogan of "Specialization of North China" put forward by the Japanese warlords at that time. Why did he do this? It turned out that at this time he took money from the Japanese through the relationship of the National Socialist Party to set up a so-called research institute in Tianjin. If you take money from the Japanese, can you not speak for the Japanese?

If he can fall into the arms of Japanese imperialism, he can naturally fall into the arms of other imperialists. In 1947, when Chiang Kai-shek signed the traitorous Sino-US Commercial Treaty with Stuart, patriotic people all over the country denounced it. Luo Longji defended this traitorous treaty everywhere, saying it was a truly equal treaty. Since he had taken money from the Japanese, he naturally wanted to take money from the Americans. He had frequent contacts with Stuart, Wedemeyer, and the American Consul General in Shanghai. What was the purpose? Let's look at these words Luo Longji said to Stuart: "The United States has already bet on a horse that is destined to lose (referring to supporting Chiang Kai-shek). If you can take out a fraction of the money to support China's democratic parties, it will have a much greater effect." Luo Longji did not expect that the Americans were more calculating and realistic than the Japanese. The Japanese could take out money to support him in running a research institute in Tianjin, but the Americans were only willing to support all the medicines he personally took.

After liberation, Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and the one-sided diplomacy had already been put forward, Luo Longji and Zhang Dongsun secretly met with the American Consul General who continued to stay in Beijing in 1949. According to Luo Longji, the content of the conversation was to ask the Consul General to tell Stuart that Stuart asked Luo to convey to Premier Zhou that the United States intended to use tens of billions of dollars in economic aid as bait to induce our country to abandon its one-sided diplomacy. Luo could not convey it. If he didn't convey it, that would be fine, why bother meeting with the American Consul General specifically for this matter? Obviously, besides this, there must be other ulterior motives. Second, Luo Longji is a person who specializes in colluding with reactionary forces to engage in conspiracy activities.

In 1946, the Communist Party of China conducted a year of patient negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek in order to strive for domestic peace. Luo Longji also participated in the peace talks in the relationship of the China Democratic League. At that time, the Kuomintang's method of dealing with the Democratic League was to strike and woo, to attack the progressive forces in the League, the National Salvation Association, and to win over the backward elements in the League, Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji. The specific person representing the Kuomintang to contact Luo Longji was Lei Zhen. Luo Longji, who could sell himself to the Japanese and Americans, naturally colluded with Lei Zhen very easily. At that time, the so-called Third Force - the Democratic League, the Youth Party and the so-called "social elites" - often held meetings at the Nanjing Bank of Communications. Almost every time there was a meeting, Lei Zhen would run to the Bank of Communications, sit in a small room and ask Luo Longji to come out to inquire about the meeting situation, and influence the meeting through Luo.

On November 12, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek decided to tear up the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference and convene the bogus National Assembly alone. Logically, anyone who signed the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference should not participate in the unilaterally convened bogus National Assembly. At this time, the Youth Party colluded with Luo Longji to try to deceive the Third Force into participating in the bogus National Assembly by stealing the day and changing the day. They drafted a letter to Chiang Kai-shek in the name of the Third Force, requesting to continue peace talks for a month. If there was still no result by then, Chiang Kai-shek could convene the bogus National Assembly, and the entire Third Force would participate. The letter was drafted on November 12 and everyone was tricked into signing it. That morning, Premier Zhou, Dong Biwu, and Minister Li Weihan went to the Bank of Communications to exchange opinions with everyone, but they were concealed and not allowed to know. As soon as the three of them left, they immediately handed the letter to Mo Dehui, preparing to deliver it to Chiang Kai-shek that night. Fortunately, Shen Junru discovered this conspiracy in time and retrieved the letter, so that the conspiracy finally failed. Otherwise, in addition to the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party exposing their true colors, I don't know how many people would be forced to be dragged into the muddy waters of the bogus National Assembly.

Chiang's bogus National Assembly was finally convened on November 15, and the peace talks completely broke down. Most of the responsible comrades of the Democratic League returned to Shanghai to live, but Luo Longji continued to stay in Nanjing and collude with Lei Zhen. By the end of 1947, after the Democratic League was forced to announce its dissolution, the Kuomintang sent Luo Longji to live in the most luxurious Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai. The monthly hospitalization fee of how many taels of gold was paid by Lei Zhen, and Lei Zhen went to Shanghai from Nanjing from time to time to have secret talks with Luo Longji. Of course, the content of the secret talks would never be anything decent.

Again, Luo Longji has consistently opposed the Communist Party and resisted the leadership of the Party.

When he was studying in the United States in his early years, he organized a reactionary nationalist small group called "Dajiang Society". Most of the people who participated are now in Taiwan. After returning to China, he and Hu Shi, Liang Shiqiu and others ran a publication in Shanghai called "New Moon", specializing in writing anti-communist articles. At that time, they called themselves the "New Moon School."

In 1948, Luo Longji lived in the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai and had a lot of freedom of movement. The Shanghai underground party found someone several times to invite him to Hong Kong or the Liberated Area, but he refused on the pretext of inconvenience. Not only did he not go himself, but he also influenced Zhang Bojun not to go. Why didn't he go? It turned out that he was thinking of a completely different set of things. At the end of 1948, Comrade Wu Han passed through Shanghai to the Liberated Area. Luo Longji wrote a written opinion and asked Wu Han to hand it over to Shen Junru to forward it to the CPC, proposing the conditions for implementing parliamentary politics and harmonious diplomacy, and threatening that the Democratic League would retreat to the opposition party when necessary.

After Shanghai was liberated in May 1949, Luo Longji immediately proposed that the Communist Party members in the League "return to the team" and asked them to withdraw from the Democratic League. Combining this with his recent proposal at the United Front Work Department's symposium that the Party should not develop among intellectuals or among democratic parties, it can be seen that his anti-Party thinking is not accidental, but consistent and inherited.

Again, Luo Longji is a conspiratorial careerist who specializes in engaging in small cliques to satisfy personal desires.

The reactionary "Dajiang Society," "New Moon School," and National Socialist Party mentioned above were all organized or actively participated in by Luo Longji. Luo Longji started out by engaging in these reactionary small cliques. After liberation, the China Democratic League held the Fourth Plenary Session to review and correct the past erroneous line represented by Luo Longji, which was very timely and necessary at the time. However, Luo Longji believed that it was a blow to him within the League, so he relapsed and organized a small group of people around him within the League in 1950 to engage in intra-League factions. The people who joined in Beijing included Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Liu Wangliming, Zhou Jingwen, and those from other places included Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, Pan Dakui, Ma Zhemin, Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Sun Dayu and others. I was also one of those who participated at the time. He often said to people: "The predecessor of the Democratic League was the Political Group Alliance, and everyone has their own small circles (mainly referring to the National Salvation Association and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party). If the non-party members in the League do not organize, we will suffer in the League." He also said: "The United Front Work Department's arrangement of the Democratic League's position is to take care of all aspects. How the United Front Work Department treats us depends on how much capital we have (referring to how many people)."

Luo Longji organized this small clique initially to deal with Zhang Bojun. Zhang and Luo were both unprincipled personal careerists. They clashed for personal gain, and of course they could also combine with each other to achieve their conspiracy. Zhang Bojun said in his speech in the Anhui group of the National People's Congress: "Luo has a set of people in the Central Committee of the Democratic League, and I am willing to take over his set of people." Who used whom between Zhang and Luo? Let's quote Zhang Bojun's speech in the Anhui group. Zhang Bojun said: "Is he using me, or am I using him, or are we using each other? I think it's a perfect match... it's a tacit collusion." Under this kind of "tacit collusion," the Zhang-Luo alliance was formed.

Finally, Luo Longji has real crimes.

Luo Longji openly said at the National Working Conference of the China Democratic League in March this year: "Today's contradiction on the issue of intellectuals is the contradiction between petty-bourgeois intellectuals and petty-bourgeois large intellectuals." This means that the Party cannot lead large intellectuals and instigates intellectuals to resist ideological remolding. This echoes Zhang Naiqi's statement that the bourgeoisie has no duality and does not need to study. Zhang Naiqi is releasing poison to the bourgeoisie, and Luo Longji is releasing poison to the intellectuals.

Since he put forward the reactionary proposal to establish the so-called "Rehabilitation Committee," he has been met with angry accusations from all patriotic people, but has won the cheers of a few domestic reactionaries and right-wing elements. He has received a total of one hundred and dozens of reactionary letters, agreeing with his proposal. He personally instructed to reply "to create public opinion from all aspects, and to suggest to the United Front Work Department or the CPPCC." What kind of public opinion to create? Obviously, it is to call for opposition to the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, anti-people, and anti-government public opinion. This fully exposes his vicious attempt to create chaos and frantically attack the Party. Can it still be said that he has not committed real crimes!

For Luo Longji, a conspiratorial careerist without national integrity, who specializes in colluding with reactionary forces, consistently opposes the Communist Party and engages in conspiratorial small cliques, I expose his ugly history and I accuse him of his real crimes!

Talking about Myself

Below, I would also like to take this opportunity to give an account of my mistakes to all the representatives on this solemn rostrum.

The erroneous remarks I made at the symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee have had a harmful impact on society, which makes me feel very ashamed and heartbroken.

Where the Mistake Lies

My erroneous proposition is not an individual one but a series of them. This shows that there are serious bourgeois ideas in my mind, and these erroneous ideas will be strongly expressed whenever there is an opportunity. I talked about the democratic parties should play a greater role than in the past in formulating national or local policies and guidelines. I also talked about it is not appropriate to emphasize party relations or the role of party organizations in government agencies and schools. I also talked about in government agencies and schools, having one more party identity adds one more layer of relationships, and also adds one more opportunity to generate contradictions. I also talked about the democratic parties do not need to establish grassroots organizations or have organizational life. Finally, I also suggested merging the four parties—the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society—into an intellectual party.

Where are these mistakes?

First of all, the democratic parties have played a role in formulating policies and guidelines in the past. Premier Zhou's report clearly stated: "The major policies and guidelines of the country are formulated by all parties through various forms of prior consultation and then submitted to the relevant state organs for discussion, and representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democratic persons participate in the organs that implement these guidelines." The CPPCC National Committee and the local CPPCCs at all levels are the organs that specifically carry out this consultation. Of course, the work of the democratic parties in the past has not been done perfectly in every aspect. The investigation and research within the scope of their united front division of labor has not been done enough, and the situation has not been understood deeply or thoroughly. They have failed to better play the role of the Party's assistant in formulating relevant policies and guidelines. In the future, they should strengthen their work in order to play a better role.

Secondly, it is an extremely absurd view that it is not appropriate to emphasize party relations or the role of party organizations in government agencies and schools. I mistakenly believed that the Party's leadership is only reflected in the leadership of policies and guidelines. As for the business units such as government agencies and schools, they themselves do not determine policies, but are institutions that implement policies and complete tasks, so there is no need to emphasize the organizational role of the Party in these institutions. In fact, the Party's general policies and guidelines must be specifically implemented through various business units. If the Party does not specifically play an organizational role in these business units, then the Party's policies and guidelines will be driven in the air and cannot land. Premier Zhou's report clearly stated: "To ensure the correct implementation of all aspects of the government's policies, there must be strong core leadership of the Communist Party in government agencies, schools, enterprises, and organizations."

Secondly, the so-called having one more party identity in government agencies and schools adds one more opportunity to generate contradictions is also an extremely erroneous idea. The existence of contradictions within things is a universal and eternal phenomenon. The People's Daily editorial on April 13 this year, "How to Deal with Contradictions Among the People," stated: In socialist society, among the people, between advanced elements and backward elements, between people with correct attitudes and people with erroneous attitudes, between this part of the masses and that part of the masses, and between the people and their leaders, there are also such and such contradictions. The existence of parties reflects reality and is for the purpose of better resolving contradictions. As the Party's assistant, the democratic parties in government agencies and schools are helping the Party to resolve those contradictions that objectively exist.

Regarding the democratic parties do not need to establish grassroots organizations or have organizational life, this does not meet the requirements of the democratic party members, nor does it violate the spiritual essence of socialist-type democratic parties. Premier Zhou's report stated: "What the broad masses of the people expect from the democratic parties is to firmly stand on the socialist position and pay attention to ideological remolding in order to fully play their active role in national life." Socialist democratic parties have a major responsibility to educate and ideologically remold their members, so that the members can smoothly transition to laboring people's intellectuals in the true sense of the word. If grassroots organizations are not established and organizational life is not conducted, through what will political and ideological education work be carried out?

Finally, regarding the opinion of merging the four parties, this is a completely unrealistic and subjective idea. The phenomenon of overlapping and bumping into each other in the development of organizations by the four parties can only be resolved through mutual consultation. Dissolving and merging is the idea of cutting the feet to fit the shoes. Each party has its own personnel relations and historical origins. No one can force them to dissolve, and no one can force them to merge.

Where the Errors Come From

Examining the reasons for the above series of erroneous ideas, it should also be said that it is not accidental, but has certain ideological roots.

In the final analysis, it is basically a problem of unstable position. Chairman Mao put forward six standards for judging all remarks and actions in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and pointed out that "Among these six standards, the most important are the two standards of the socialist road and the leadership of the Party." Everything we say and do should always think about whether it is taking the road to socialism or violating the road to socialism? Is it strengthening the leadership of the Party or weakening the leadership of the Party? Premier Zhou's report stated: "It must be affirmed that the Communist Party is the leading force and the core force of the united front, and socialism is the political basis of the united front, that is, the common goal of unity and struggle of the people of the whole country. These unshakable principles are the track that the democratic parties participating in the people's democratic united front must follow. Leaving this track means being outside the united front." This is a basic position. Whenever you violate it, you will immediately make a principled mistake.

Secondly, with an unstable position subjectively, naturally evil from the outside will invade. Although I and Luo Longji had drawn a clear line between ourselves and him politically as early as 1952, drawing a clear line politically does not mean drawing a clear line ideologically. Being with him for a long time, "those who are near vermilion are stained red, and those who are near ink are blackened," and his set of bourgeois ideas unknowingly infected me. For example, at the beginning of last year, Luo Longji incited, and with the support of Zhang Bojun, the Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League suggested to the National Committee of the CPPCC to establish a committee on the issue of intellectuals. This is naturally their use of legal means to carry out their illegal purposes. I also tried my best to win the adoption of this suggestion at the office meetings and working meetings of the National Committee of the CPPCC. This shows that I not only became Luo Longji's prisoner ideologically, but also became his tool politically.

Finally, in recent years, I have become increasingly trusted by the Party and the people, and subjectively I have developed a sense of pride and complacency, so I have relaxed my studies. I have not studied the major historical documents of last year well. I have not studied the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat well, so I cannot grasp the correct direction on international political issues. I have not studied the documents of the Eighth National Congress well, so I am also unclear about how to implement the Party's leadership. In May this year, at the report meeting on the work of grassroots organizations of democratic parties in Tsinghua University convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, I also talked a lot about the system of responsibility of the Party committee in universities. In fact, I still don't understand what the content of the system of responsibility of the Party committee stipulated by the Eighth National Congress is. Chairman Mao taught us: "Modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind." In recent years, I have become proud because of the Party's trust, and I have relaxed my studies. I have fallen behind, and I have failed the Party's trust in me.

An unstable position is a congenital deficiency, and relaxing study lacks nutrition. Naturally, it cannot resist the bourgeois ideological bacteria that are often encountered, which finally led me to produce the above-mentioned series of erroneous ideas and remarks.

I am determined to strengthen my study and transform myself, on the one hand to fight against my own erroneous ideas, and on the other hand to wage a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements, mainly the Zhang-Luo conspiracy group. Through the actual struggle against Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, it will in turn help my self-education and self-transformation.

I firmly stand in the ranks of the struggle of all the comrades of the China Democratic League, and vow to expose all the conspiracies and organizations of the Zhang-Luo alliance cleanly and thoroughly in broad daylight.

### 揭露罗隆基的本来面貌并检讨我自己的错误  叶笃义的发言

专栏：

    揭露罗隆基的本来面貌并检讨我自己的错误
    叶笃义的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。
    周总理的报告中说：“我们必须在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，对这种人进行必要的坚决的斗争，使绝大多数真正爱国的人认识到右派分子的立场和行为的错误。”我愿意在这里揭露罗隆基历史上的本来面貌和他一贯的反党、反社会主义的言论和行为。
    谈罗隆基
    罗隆基目前的反党、反社会主义的活动并非出于偶然的，而是有它的历史根源的。
    首先，罗隆基是一个没有民族气节的无所不为的人。
    当一九三五年到三七年的时候，全国抗日救亡运动风起云涌，有历史意义的伟大的“一二·九”和“一二·一六”学生运动适于此时在平津爆发。当时罗隆基参加了张君劢、张东荪的反动的国社党，主持天津的益世报和北平的晨报。他的报纸对于爱国抗日运动不但不支持，他反而提出“南方可以谈抗日，北方只能谈反蒋”的奇怪论调。那个时候正是宋哲元的所谓“冀察政委会”统治平津，是个半汉奸性质的政权。罗隆基的所谓“北方谈反蒋”实质上就是与当时日本军阀提出的“华北特殊化”的口号相呼应。他为什么这样做呢？原来他就在这个时候以国社党的关系拿了日本人的钱在天津办了一个所谓的研究所。拿了日本人的钱不替日本人说话，行吗？
    能倒在日本帝国主义的怀抱里，自然也就能倒在其他帝国主义的怀抱里。当一九四七年蒋介石同司徒雷登签定了卖国的美蒋商约，全国爱国人士都一致声讨，罗隆基却到处为这个卖国条约辩护，说它是一个真正的平等的条约。他既然拿过日本人的钱，也自然想要拿美国人的钱。他同司徒雷登、魏德迈和美国的上海总领事等时有往还。目的为的是什么呢？用罗隆基同司徒雷登讲的这几句话来看吧：“美国已经买上了一匹输定了的马（指支援蒋介石）。假如你们能拿出几分之一的钱来支援中国的民主党派，作用会大得多。”罗隆基没有想到美国人比日本人更会打算盘，更现实主义，日本人可以拿出钱来支援他在天津办研究所，但美国人只肯支援他个人服用的一切药品。
    解放以后，毛主席“论人民民主专政”里一边倒的外交已经提出来了，罗隆基还同张东荪两个人在四九年秘密地会见了当时继续留住北京的美国总领事。据罗隆基说，谈话内容是请该总领事转告司徒雷登，司徒托罗转达周总理，美国拟以几十亿美元经济援助为钓饵诱使我国放弃一边倒的外交政策，罗不能转达。不转达，也就算了，何必专为此事会见美国总领事？很明显，除此而外，一定还有什么其他不可告人的勾当。其次，罗隆基是一个专门同反动势
    力勾搭搞阴谋活动的人。
    一九四六年中共为了争取国内和平同蒋介石进行了一整年的耐心的谈判。罗隆基以民盟的关系也参加了和谈。当时国民党对付民盟的办法是一打一拉，打击盟内进步力量救国会，拉拢盟内落后分子张君劢、罗隆基。代表国民党同罗隆基联系的具体人是雷震。能卖身投靠日本人和美国人的罗隆基当然很容易地也就同雷震勾结起来。当时所谓第三方面——民盟、青年党和所谓“社会贤达”——经常在南京交通银行开会。几乎每次开会的时候雷震都要跑到交通银行去，坐在一个小房间里找罗隆基出去询问开会情况，并通过罗来影响会议。
    一九四六年十一月十二日蒋介石决心撕毁旧政协决议，单独召开伪国大。论理凡是在旧政协决议上签了字的人都不应当参加片面召开的伪国大的。这个时候青年党串通罗隆基想用偷天换日的手法骗取第三方面全体参加伪国大。他们以第三方面名义拟了一个给蒋介石的信件，要求继续和谈一个月，到时如仍无结果，蒋介石就可召开伪国大，第三方面全体参加。信是十一月十二日拟好的，并骗取大家签了字。当天上午周总理、董老、李维汉部长到交通银行同大家交换意见，但是被瞒着不让知道，等他们三人一走，马上把信件交给莫德惠，准备当晚送交蒋介石。幸亏沈衡老及时地发现了这是个阴谋，把信件追回来使那个阴谋终于未能得逞。不然的话，除了暴露原形的青年党和民社党而外，还不定有多少人被迫拖下伪国大的混水。
    蒋记伪国大终于十一月十五日召开，和谈完全破裂了。民盟大部分负责同志都回到上海去居住，但罗隆基却继续留在南京同雷震勾勾搭搭。到了四七年底民盟被迫宣布解散之后，国民党把罗隆基送到上海一家最阔绰的虹桥疗养院居住。每月多少两黄金的住院费都是由雷震代付的，雷震不时还由南京到上海去同罗隆基密谈。当然密谈的内容绝不会是什么体面的事情。
    再次，罗隆基是一贯反共和反抗党的领导的。
    他早年在美国留学的时候就组织过一个反动的国家主义派的小团体，名叫“大江会”，参加的人现在大部分都在台湾。回国以后，他同胡适、梁实秋等人在上海办了一个刊物，叫“新月”，专门写反共的文章。当时他们自称为“新月派”。
    一九四八年罗隆基住在上海虹桥疗养院，行动是非常自由的，可以随便出去。上海地下党几次找人邀他到香港或者到解放区，但他都拿行动不便为借口，拒绝不去。他不但自己不去，同时也影响了张表老也不去。他为什么不去呢？原来他想的是整个另外的一套。四八年底吴晗同志路过上海到解放区，罗隆基写了一个书面意见托吴晗带交沈衡老转致中共，提出实行议会政治和协和外交的条件，并提出民盟在必要时退居在野党的威胁。
    四九年五月上海解放后，罗隆基一到北京立即提出盟内共产党员“归队”，要他们退出民盟。结合他在最近统战部座谈会上提出的党不要在知识分子中发展，不要在民主党派中发展，可以看出他的反党思想不是偶然的，而是一贯的，一脉相承下来的。
    再次，罗隆基是专门搞小集团来满足个人欲望的阴谋野心家。
    上面谈到的反动的“大江会”、“新月派”和国社党，罗隆基都是组织者或积极参加者。罗隆基就是靠搞这些反动的小集团起家的。解放以后民盟召开四中全会检查和纠正以罗隆基为代表的过去的错误路线，这在当时是非常适时的和需要的。但罗隆基却认为那是盟内对他的打击，因而故态复萌，在五○年又在盟内组织了一小部分人在自己周围搞盟内派系。在北京参加进去的人有张东荪、曾昭抡、潘光旦、费孝通、吴景超、刘王立明、周鲸文，外地的有张志和、范朴斋、潘大逵、马哲民、彭文应、陈仁炳、孙大雨等人。我当时也是参加进去的一个。他经常对人说：“民盟的前身是政团同盟，各人有各人小圈子（主要指救国会同农工民主党），假如盟内无党派分子不组织起来，我们在盟内就会吃亏。”他又说：“统战部安排民盟的位置是照顾各方面的，统战部如何对待我们就看我们有多少本钱（指多少人）”。
    罗隆基组织这个小集团最初本来是为对付章伯钧的。章、罗二人都是无原则的个人野心家。他们为了个人利益而冲突，同时也当然可以为了达到他们的阴谋而互相结合。章伯钧在人大安徽小组的发言中说：“罗有一套人马在民盟中央，他的那一套人马我愿意接收过来”。章、罗二人谁利用了谁呢？还是引用章伯钧在安徽小组的发言吧，章伯钧说：“是他利用我，还是我利用他，还是互相利用，我看是相得益彰……是心心相印的勾结”。就在这种“心心相印的勾结”之下，于是乎章、罗联盟就组成了。
    最后，罗隆基是有现实罪行的。
    罗隆基在今年三月间民盟全国工作会议上公开地说：“今天知识分子问题上的矛盾是无产阶级小知识分子同小资产阶级大知识分子之间的矛盾”。这就是说党不能领导大知识分子，唆使知识分子抗拒思想改造。这与章乃器说资产阶级没有两面性，不必学习，说法是相互呼应的。章乃器在对资产阶级放毒素，罗隆基在对知识分子放毒素。
    自从他提出成立所谓“平反委员会”的反动主张后，他遭到一切爱国人士的愤怒指责，但却获得少数国内反动分子和右派分子的喝彩。他一共收到一百几十封反动信件，赞同他的主张。他亲自批示回复“从各方面造成舆论，向统战部或政协建议”。造成什么舆论呢？很明显，是号召反对肃反，反人民，反政府的舆论。这充分暴露出他的制造混乱，向党疯狂进攻的恶毒企图。这难道还能说他没有达到现实罪行吗！
    对罗隆基这样一个没有民族气节，专门同反动势力勾搭，一贯反共和搞阴谋小集团的阴谋野心家，我揭露他的丑恶历史，我控诉他的现实罪行！
    谈我自己
    以下我还愿意借着这个机会在这个庄严的讲坛上对我所犯的错误面向全体代表做一个交代。
    我在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上所发表的错误的言论，在社会上发生了有害的影响，使我感到十分惭愧和痛心。
    错在什么地方
    我的错误的主张不是个别的而是一系列的。这说明我的思想中存在着严重的资产阶级思想，这种错误思想一有机会就强烈地表现出来。我谈到在制定全国的或地方的政策方针上，民主党派应比过去发挥更大的作用。我还谈到在机关、学校中不宜强调党派关系，不宜强调发挥党派组织作用。我又谈到在机关、学校中，多一层党派身份就多增加一层关系，也就多一层产生矛盾的机会。我还谈到民主党派不必建立基层组织，不必过组织生活。最后，我还建议把四个党派——民盟、民进、农工、九三——合并为一个知识分子政党。
    这些错误在那里呢？
    首先，民主党派在制定方针政策上过去是发挥了作用的。周总理的报告内说得明白：“国家的大政方针都是由各方面通过各种形式事先协商然后提交有关国家机关讨论制定的，而在执行这些方针的机关中，又有各民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表人物参加。”政协全国委员会和地方各级政协就是专门进行这种协商的机关。当然，民主党派的工作过去未都做得尽善尽美，在自己统战分工的范围内调查研究做得不够，情况了解不深不透，在制定有关的方针政策时未能更好地发挥党的助手作用，今后应加强工作，以求发挥更好的作用。
    其次，在机关、学校中不宜强调党派关系，不宜强调发挥党派组织作用，这是极端荒谬的看法。我错误地认为党的领导只体现在方针政策上的领导就够了。至于机关、学校等业务单位，它们本身不是决定政策的，而是贯彻政策完成任务的机构，因此不需要强调党在这些机构中的组织作用。事实上，党的总的方针政策是要具体地通过各个业务单位来实践的。假如党不在这些业务单位中具体地发挥组织作用，那就把党的方针政策驾在空中不能着地。周总理的报告讲得清楚：“要保证政府各方面政策的正确执行，就必须在机关、学校、企业和团体中都有共产党的坚强的核心的领导。”
    次之，所谓在机关、学校中多一层党派身份就多一层产生矛盾的机会，这也是极端错误的想法。事物内部存在着矛盾是一种普遍的永恒的现象。今年四月十三日人民日报“怎样对待人民内部的矛盾”的社论说：在社会主义社会中，在人民内部，在先进分子和落后分子之间，在抱着正确态度的人们和抱着错误态度的人们之间，在这一部分群众同那一部分群众之间，在人民群众同他们的领导者之间，也都存在着这样那样的矛盾。党派的存在是反映现实的，是为的更好地解决矛盾的。作为党的助手，在机关、学校中的民主党派是帮助党来解决那些客观上本来存在着的矛盾的。
    关于民主党派不必建立基层组织，不必过组织生活，这既不符合民主党派成员的要求，也违背社会主义类型民主党派的精神实质。周总理的报告中说：“广大人民所希望于各民主党派的就是坚定地站在社会主义立场上，注意进行思想改造，以充分发挥他们在国家生活中的积极作用。”社会主义的民主党派对他们的成员有进行教育、进行思想改造的重大责任，使成员们都能顺利地过渡到名副其实的劳动人民知识分子。假如不建立基层组织，不过组织生活，政治思想教育工作通过什么来进行呢？
    最后，关于四个党派合并的意见，这完全是不实际的主观主义想法。四个党派在发展组织上的交叉碰头现象只有通过彼此协商来解决。解散合并是削足适履的想法。各个党派都有他的人事关系和历史渊源。谁也不能强迫他们解散，谁也不能强迫他们合并。
    错误从哪里来
    检查一下产生以上一系列错误思想的原因，也应当说不是偶然的，是有一定的思想根源的。
    归根结底，基本上还是立场不稳的问题，毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中提出判断一切言论和行动的六项标准，并且指出“这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”我们的一言一行都应随时想到它是走向社会主义的道路呢，还是违反社会主义的道路呢？是加强党的领导呢，还是削弱党的领导呢？周总理的报告中说：“必须肯定，共产党是统一战线的领导力量和核心力量，社会主义是统一战线的政治基础，也就是全国人民团结奋斗的共同目标。这些不可动摇的原则，是参加人民民主统一战线的各民主党派所必须遵循的轨道。离开这个轨道，就是自外于统一战线。”这是个基本立场，什么时候违背了它，就立刻发生原则性错误。
    其次，主观上立场不稳了，自然随之而来的是外邪侵入。我和罗隆基虽然远在五二年在政治上就和他划清了界限，但政治上划清了界限并不等于在思想上划清楚界限。长期和他处在一起，“近朱者赤，近墨者黑”，他的那套资产阶级思想也就不知不觉地感染了我。譬如去年年初罗隆基鼓动的，并得到章伯钧支持的，通过民盟中常会向政协全国委员会建议成立知识分子问题委员会。这自然是他们以合法的手段来进行他们非法的目的。我在政协全国委员会的办公会议和工作会议上也极力争取采纳这个建议。这说明我不但思想上作了罗隆基的俘虏，并且政治上也作了他的工具。
    最后，自己近年来由于越来越多地得到了党和人民的信任，主观上产生了骄傲自满的情绪，因而学习也就放松了。去年一年的几个重大的历史文件我都未好好地学习。一论再论无产阶级专政的历史经验我未好好学习，因此我对国际政治问题就掌握不了正确的方向。八大文件我也未好好学习，因此对如何贯彻党的领导问题也模糊不清。今年五月间在中共中央统战部召集的清华大学民主党派基层组织工作汇报会上，我对高等学校的党委负责制也夸夸其谈了一番，其实八大所规定的党委负责制究竟是什么内容我还搞不清楚呢。毛主席教育我们说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。近年来由于党的信任而使我骄傲起来，放松了学习，我落后了，我辜负了党对我的信任。
    立场不稳是先天不足，放松学习就缺乏营养，自然就抵抗不住经常接触到的资产阶级思想细菌，终于使我产生了上面所说到的一系列的错误思想和言论。
    我决心加强学习，改造自己，一方面同自己的错误思想作斗争，另方面同右派分子，主要是章罗阴谋集团，作坚决的斗争。通过对章伯钧罗隆基的实际斗争，反过来也有助于我的自我教育和自我改造。
    我坚决地站在全体民盟同志的斗争行列中，誓把章罗联盟的全部阴谋和组织干净彻底地暴露在光天化日之下。
