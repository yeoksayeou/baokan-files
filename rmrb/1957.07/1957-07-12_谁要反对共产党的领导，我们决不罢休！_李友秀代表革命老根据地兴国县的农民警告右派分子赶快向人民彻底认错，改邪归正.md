Whoever Opposes the Leadership of the Communist Party, We Will Never Give Up!
Li Youxiu, representative of the farmers of the old revolutionary base area of Xingguo County, warns right-wingers to quickly and thoroughly admit their mistakes to the people and correct their evil ways.

    I fully support Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's government work report. I fully agree with the reports of the other leaders.

    I am from Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, and I am a rural woman. Jiangxi is an old revolutionary base area, and I am now speaking on behalf of the people of Xingguo County. We have seen in the newspapers the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-people speeches and actions of right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, and the people of the entire county unanimously express their indignation. In particular, our agricultural cooperatives have sent letters entrusting me to warn those right-wingers not to stir up trouble, to quickly abandon their reactionary positions, to thoroughly admit their mistakes to the people, and to correct their evil ways. If the right-wingers still insist on their reactionary anti-Party and anti-socialist positions, we will resolutely struggle against them to the end.

    Right-wingers: You want to use the Communist Party's rectification campaign, and exploit some shortcomings in our work, to negate our great achievements, stir up trouble, sow discord, disturb people's minds, and attempt to create social chaos, in order to carry out your conspiracy to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and restore capitalism. However, your plans and your estimates are completely wrong. We, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have undergone long-term revolutionary struggles, have a high level of class consciousness, and can all distinguish between right and wrong. We all understand the benefits of the revolution and have gained from the revolution. We have also suffered severe massacres and devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and we will never forget this debt of blood. We, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, all know who our enemies are, who our friends are, who our own people are, and who our leaders are. When we, the people, see your reactionary words and deeds, we know your conspiracies and tricks. You pretend to care about the people and speak for the people, but in fact, your words and deeds are all against the people, against socialism, and against the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Those right-wingers spread rumors that "farmers' lives are too hard." This is deliberately telling lies with open eyes, intentionally spreading rumors and sabotage, and sowing discord. Comparing our lives in the cooperative with those before liberation, they are many times better. In the past, farmers lived on bran and vegetables for half the year, and some even had no rice to eat after harvesting the crops. As the saying goes, "The sickle hangs on the wall, and there is no rice to eat." Now, the cooperative members are all well-fed and warmly clothed. For example, Lan Shuixiu, a member of our cooperative, had no rice left over at night before liberation and had to sell her children to make a living. Now, she has built a new house and has surplus grain. People who used to wear rags now have new clothes, new quilts, and new mosquito nets. In the past, the vast majority of people were illiterate. Now, the vast majority of young and middle-aged people are literate and can write simple letters and read newspapers. We women, like men, have stood up politically and economically. In our county, many women have become heads of agricultural cooperatives, deputy heads, township heads, and deputy township heads. Speaking of the whole province, there are also many female comrades who have become county heads and deputy county heads. Right-wingers, if you don't believe it, then please come and see us, compare the current situation with the past, and don't talk nonsense anymore. In our county, many people were massacred by the reactionaries during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and even now, the population has not recovered. There are many female laborers and few male laborers in our cooperative. Out of 317 laborers, only 114 are male, and 203 are female, which is twice as many as male laborers. Many men in our county have contributed their lives for the sake of the motherland and the people. Many women have lost their husbands and sons, and only then have they gained the victory of the revolution and today's happy life. Xiao Yilan, who is 83 years old in our cooperative, said: "Whoever opposes the leadership of the Communist Party and opposes socialism, I will break his head with a carrying pole and a hoe and fight him to the death. We cannot let the blood of the martyrs flow in vain." Right-wingers, if all 500 million farmers in our country pick up hoes and carrying poles to beat you, you will not be able to bear it. We have a large ship made up of 600 million people with one heart, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are steering us. You right-wingers have no power to overturn our large ship, nor can you prevent us from advancing towards socialism and communism. You right-wingers should honestly reform yourselves. If you still insist on your reactionary stance, you will perish. This is my warning to you, and it is also a warning to you from all working people. As for what you do, please choose for yourselves.

    谁要反对共产党的领导，我们决不罢休！
    李友秀代表革命老根据地兴国县的农民警告右派分子赶快向人民彻底认错，改邪归正
    我完全拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告和周总理的政府工作报告，完全同意其他几位首长的报告。
    我是江西省兴国县人，是一个农村妇女。江西是革命老根据地，我现在代表兴国县人民讲几句话。我们在报纸上看到章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子反党、反社会主义、反人民的言论和行动，全县人民一致表示愤恨，特别是我们的农业社，来信委托我警告那些右派分子，不要兴风作浪，赶快放弃反动立场，向人民彻底承认错误，改邪归正。如果右派分子仍然坚持反党、反社会主义的反动立场，我们就坚决和他斗争到底。
    右派分子们：你们想利用共产党整风，利用我们工作中的某些缺点，否定我们的伟大成绩，搬弄是非，挑拨离间，扰乱人心，企图造成社会混乱，趁机进行反党、反社会主义，恢复资本主义的阴谋活动。但是，你们的打算，你们的估计完全错了。我们老根据地人民，在共产党、毛主席的正确领导下，经过了长期革命斗争，有较高的阶级觉悟，都能够分清是非。我们都懂得革命的好处，得到了革命的利益。我们也曾经遭受过国民党反动派的严重屠杀与摧残，这笔大血债，我们是永远不会忘记的。我们老根据地人民，都懂得谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，谁是自家人，谁是我们的领导者。你们右派分子的反动言论和行动，我们人民一看，就知道你们的阴谋诡计，你们装模作样的好像关心人民，替人民说话，其实你们的言论和行动都是反对人民、反对社会主义、反对共产党的领导。
    那些右派分子造谣说“农民生活太苦了”，这是睁着眼睛说胡话，是有意的造谣破坏，挑拨离间。就拿我们社里生活和解放前比较，不知要强多少倍。过去农民是半年糠菜半年粮，甚至有的割完禾，就没有米吃，俗语说：“镰刀挂上壁，马上没米吃”，现在社员都吃得饱、穿得暖了。如我们社里的社员兰水秀，解放前家里没有过夜米，以致卖儿女维持生活，现在盖了新房子，并有了余粮。过去穿破烂衣服的人，现在都做了新衣服、新被子、新蚊帐。过去绝大多数人是文盲，现在青壮年绝大多数都认识字了，可以写简单的信和看报纸。我们妇女同男人一样，在政治上经济上都翻了身，我们县里有许多妇女当上了农业社长、副社长、乡长、副乡长，从全省来说，还有不少女同志当了县长、副县长。右派分子们，如果你们不相信，那就请你们到我们那里看一看，把现在的情况和过去比一比，不要再胡说八道。我们县里，在第二次国内革命战争时期，被反动派屠杀了很多人，一直到现在，人口还未恢复。我们社里女劳动力多，男劳动力少，在三百一十七个劳动力中，男的只有一百一十四人，女的有二百零三人，比男劳动力要多一倍。我县有许多男人，为了祖国，为了人民，贡献出自己的生命，有许多妇女失去了自己的丈夫和儿子，才换到革命的胜利和今天的幸福生活。我们社里八十三岁的萧宜兰说：“谁要反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，我就用扁担锄头打破他的头，和他拼命，我们不能让烈士的鲜血白流”。右派分子，如果我们全国五万万农民都拿起锄头和扁担打你们，你们是受不了的。我们有六万万人的一条心组成的大船，并有共产党和毛主席给我们撑舵，你们这些右派分子没有丝毫力量摇翻我们的大船，也不能阻碍我们向社会主义和共产主义前进。你们这些右派分子还是老老实实的改造自己吧，如果你们仍然坚持反动立场，那就会自取灭亡。这是我对你们的警告，也是所有劳动人民向你们提出的警告，至于你们怎样作，请你们自己选择吧。
