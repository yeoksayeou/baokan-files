Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again emphasized on July 16th that the United States does not intend to eliminate atomic weapons.

Speaking at a press conference about the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting in London, Dulles said that disarmament is a large and very complex problem, and even if an agreement is reached in principle, how to turn this principle into details and practical things will still cause great difficulties. He said that as for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the United States does not currently intend to make these weapons cease to exist, and the United States does not intend to stop using fissionable materials to manufacture atomic weapons until an agreement is reached.

When asked why the United States had taken so long to "gradually propose" its disarmament proposals, Dulles prevaricated, saying that this was because there were differences among Western countries, and the United States and its allies had to conduct "full explorations" of some of the issues.

Dulles was unwilling to reach an agreement quickly, but was also afraid of taking responsibility for breaking off the disarmament talks. He said that the United States does not currently favor adjourning the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. The United States is prepared to "negotiate indefinitely."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th: U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson ordered the U.S. armed forces on July 16th to reduce 100,000 troops by the end of this year to save $200 million in military spending.

The current authorized strength of the U.S. armed forces is 2.8 million, and the strength after the reduction will be 2.7 million. The reduction numbers for the three services are as follows: the Army will be reduced from 1 million to 950,000; the Navy from 675,000 to 660,000; the Marine Corps from 200,000 to 190,000; and the Air Force from 925,000 to 900,000. However, since the Army's current actual strength is 1,000,217, the Navy is 675,933, the Marine Corps is 197,392, and the Air Force is 914,804, the actual reduction number will be more than 89,000 instead of 100,000.

In issuing this order, Wilson pointed out that the reduction in the U.S. military will not greatly affect overseas deployments, including U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe, nor will it greatly affect the strength of the U.S. military, because the United States is making "the greatest effort" to "modernize" combat troops.

    杜勒斯供认存心拖延裁军谈判
    美国不打算禁止原子武器
    威尔逊宣布年内裁减军队十万人
    据新华社17日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯7月16日又一次强调，美国不打算使原子武器不再存在下去。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上谈到联合国裁军小组委员会伦敦会议的情况。他说，裁军是一个很大的而且非常复杂的问题，即使在原则上达成协议，如何把这种原则变成细节和切实可行的东西，仍将要引起很大的困难。他说，至于禁止原子武器问题，美国目前并不打算使这些武器不再继续存在下去，在达成协议以前，美国也不打算停止把裂变物质用来制造原子武器。
    有记者问，美国为什么拖延了很长的时间“逐步提出”它的裁军建议。杜勒斯推托说这是因为西方国家存在着分歧，美国和它的盟国对其中一些问题要进行“充分的探讨”。
    杜勒斯既不愿意迅速达成协议，又害怕承担使裁军谈判破裂的责任。他说，美国目前不赞成联合国裁军小组委员会休会。美国预备“无限期地谈判下去”。
    据新华社17日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国防部长威尔逊16日命令美国武装部队在今年年底以前裁减十万人，以节省军费两亿美元。
    美国武装部队目前的法定人数是二百八十万人，裁减后的人数将为二百七十万人。三军的裁减数目如下：陆军从一百万裁减到九十五万人；海军从六十七万五千裁减到六十六万；海军陆战队从二十万裁减到十九万；空军从九十二万五千裁减到九十万。但是，由于陆军目前的实际人数是一百万零二百一十七人，海军是六十七万五千九百三十三人，海军陆战队是十九万七千三百九十二人；空军是九十一万四千八百零四人，所以实际的裁减数目将是八万九千多人而不是十万人。
    威尔逊在发布这个命令时指出，美国军队的裁减将不会大大影响包括美国驻西欧部队在内的海外部署，也不会大大影响美国军队的实力，因为美国正在进行“最大的努力”来使作战部队“现代化”。
