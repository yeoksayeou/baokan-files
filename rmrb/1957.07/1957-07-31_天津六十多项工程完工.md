Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th: Over sixty capital construction projects in Tianjin have been completed successively in late July. Currently, nearly two hundred capital construction projects, with a total area of over 640,000 square meters, are under intense construction.

Among the completed projects are worker dormitories totaling over 106,000 square meters, equivalent to approximately 4,000 standard rooms, and the construction of eighteen new and expanded primary and secondary school buildings to accommodate the expansion of primary and secondary school enrollment. With the transfer of a batch of capital construction projects into production, Tianjin has seen the emergence of new factories such as pesticide plants, tool factories, belt conveyor factories, and chemical raw material pharmaceutical factories. The newly completed Tianjin Chemical Raw Material Pharmaceutical Factory is the first factory in China to manufacture raw material drugs for citric acid and hydrogen peroxide.
