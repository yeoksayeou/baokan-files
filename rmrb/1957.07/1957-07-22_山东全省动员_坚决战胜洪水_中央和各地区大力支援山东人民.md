Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on the 20th, deciding to mobilize the power of the Party, government, military, and people of the entire province to overcome the extraordinary flood, the worst in a century.

　　In the half-month since July 2nd, the rainfall in the Linyi area of Shandong Province reached 500 to 600 millimeters, and the Jining and Heze areas reached 700 to 1,000 millimeters, while the average annual rainfall in the entire province in previous years was only 600 millimeters. Therefore, the areas hit by the flood this time suffered more severely.

　　After listening to the report on the disaster situation, the meeting decided to immediately transfer about 500 cadres from the provincial Party, government, military organs, and mass organizations, led by responsible cadres, to the severely affected areas to help with the rescue and restoration of production. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee decided to send Liu Binglin, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Political and Legal Work, to the Changwei and Laiyang areas to assist the local Party, government, and military leading organs in mobilizing all forces to raise and reinforce the river embankments to ensure the safety of the Jiao-Lai River and the Wei River; and to send Zhang Xincun, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Rural Work, to the Liaocheng area to inspect the dikes of the Weiyun River and assist in mobilizing local forces to do all the flood prevention preparations, in order to strive to prevent eastern and northern Shandong from suffering further losses. Wang Xinting and Peng Jiaqing, members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and heads of the Shandong Garrison, stated that wherever the troops were needed for support, as long as the Party Committee gave the word, they could immediately dispatch troops to rescue the people's lives and property.

　　The meeting determined the principle of first saving people, then livestock, and then salvaging grain. At the same time, the meeting called on workers, farmers, government cadres, and people of other strata throughout the province to either step up production, practice strict economy, or do their own work well to help the people in the disaster areas overcome the disaster.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: The flood prevention and rescue struggle of the people of Shandong Province has received the concern and support of the Central Government and various regions. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued an open letter on the 21st, expressing their gratitude to the people of all brother regions.

　　As of the 20th of this month, the Central Flood Control Headquarters had dispatched 22 aircraft, braving the harsh weather, to airdrop a large number of rescue equipment and cooked food and other materials to the severely affected areas of Linyi, Heze, and Jining in Shandong Province. The Central Flood Control Headquarters has also allocated 900,000 yuan for disaster relief and rescue, and transferred a large number of rubber boats and amphibious vehicles from Beijing, Shenyang, and other places to Shandong Province to participate in the rescue work.

　　Upon learning of the disaster, the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee of Jiangsu Province and the Nanjing troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately dispatched more than 1,000 engineers, 32 amphibious vehicles, 165 rubber boats, and a large amount of rescue equipment to Shandong Province to help rescue the victims. The sacks and grass bags allocated by the garrison in Xuzhou and the Xuzhou area flood control headquarters numbered in the tens of thousands.

　　In addition to allocating 3,000 life jackets and more than 700 lifebuoys, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and the Shanghai Garrison also sent 15 steamships.

    山东全省动员　坚决战胜洪水
    中央和各地区大力支援山东人民
    新华社济南21日电　中共山东省委20日举行的常委会议，决定动员全省党、政、军、民力量，战胜百年未有的特大洪水。
      7月2日以来的半个多月内，山东省临沂专区的降雨量达五百到六百公厘，济宁、菏泽专区达七百到一千公厘，而历年全省年平均雨量只有六百公厘。因此这次遭受洪水袭击的地区，灾情较重。
    会议在听取了关于灾情的报告后，决定立即从省级党、政、军机关和群众团体抽调五百名左右干部，由负责干部率领，分赴重灾区帮助抢险和恢复生产工作。同时，省委决定派省委常委、政法工作部长刘秉琳赴昌潍、莱阳专区，协助当地党、政、军领导机关，动员一切力量加高加固河堤，确保胶莱河和潍河的安全；派省委委员、农村工作部长张新村赴聊城专区检查卫运河的堤防，并协助动员当地力量做好一切防汛准备工作，以便力争山东东部和北部不再遭受损失。省委常委、山东驻军首长王新亭、彭嘉庆表示，那里需要部队支援，只要党委通知一声，就可以立即派部队到那里去，抢救人民的生命财产。
    会议确定首先救人，其次救牲畜，再次打捞粮食的原则。同时，会议号召全省工人、农民、机关干部以及其他阶层人民，或以加紧生产、厉行节约，或以做好自己本身工作，协助灾区人民战胜灾荒。
    新华社济南21日电　山东省人民的防洪抢险斗争，得到了中央和各地区的关怀和支援。中共山东省委员会和山东省人民委员会在21日发出公开信，对各兄弟地区人民表示谢意。
    到本月20日为止，中央防汛总指挥部已派出飞机二十二架次，冒着恶劣的天气，向山东省临沂、菏泽、济宁等专区的重灾地区空投了大批的抢救器材和熟食等物资。中央防汛总指挥部还先后拨出抢险救灾用款九十万元，以及从北京、沈阳等地调拨大批橡皮船和水陆两用汽车，来山东省参加抢救工作。
    江苏省南京市人民委员会和中国人民解放军驻南京部队闻悉灾情后，立即派出工兵一千多名，水陆两用汽车三十二辆，橡皮船一百六十五只和大量抢险器材，前来山东省帮助抢救灾民。徐州市驻军和徐州专区防汛指挥部拨来的麻袋和草包，均数以万计。
    上海市人民委员会和上海驻军除拨来救生衣三千件，救生圈七百多个外，还派来汽船十五只。
