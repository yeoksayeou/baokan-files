Anti-Rightist Street Poem
\tFang Yin
\tWe say, go left, go left,
\tYou insist on going right, going right.
\tThis is truly "a mantis trying to stop a chariot,"
\tYou are just like drawing a sword to cut flowing water.
\tYou are just like drawing a sword to cut flowing water,
\tBlinded by greed, you want to show off your skills.
\tIt is you who ignited the people's anger,
\tThis anger has burned out your fox tails and snake heads.
\tThis anger has burned out your fox tails and snake heads,
\tThe great country shall not be insulted by you!
\tThe socialist road is broad and open,
\tNo turning back, don't even think about mingling in the people's ranks!

    反右街头诗
    方殷
    我们说，向左，向左，
    你们偏要向右，向右。
    这真叫做“螳臂挡车”，
    你们正像在抽刀斩水流。
    你们正像在抽刀斩水流，
    利令智昏，你们要显一显身手
    是你们点燃了人民的怒火，
    这怒火，烧出了你们的狐尾蛇头。
    这怒火，烧出了你们的狐尾蛇头，
    大好的江山不容你们侮辱！
    社会主义大道，坦坦荡荡，
    不回头，休想混迹于人民的队伍！
