Xinhua News Agency, July 5th—Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, stated in his report to the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress today that in over 85% of minority nationality areas in China, the minority nationality farmers, serfs, and slaves who have been oppressed and suffered for thousands of years have abolished all old systems and begun to enter socialist society.

At the beginning of the meeting, Ulanhu delivered a "Report on the Establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region" to the Congress. In his report, he described the discussions and consultations on the proposals submitted to this Congress for deliberation regarding the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. He then pointed out that national regional autonomy is a fundamental policy adopted by our country to solve the national question in China based on the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and the actual conditions of China. This policy has already won the support of all nationalities in the country. They all understand that only by uniting within the great family of all nationalities in our country—the People's Republic of China—can we resist imperialist aggression and threats and promote the common progress and development of all nationalities.

Ulanhu continued, up to now, 31 minority nationalities, with a population of about 23 million, have established autonomous areas, accounting for about 90% of the minority nationality population who are eligible to establish autonomous areas and live in concentrated communities. As the vast majority of minority nationalities in our country begin to enter socialist society, the economy and culture of the minority nationality areas have greatly developed.

Ulanhu sternly refuted the conspiracies and attempts of the bourgeois right-wingers to oppose the Party's national policy. He pointed out that the people of all minority nationalities in our country have clearly seen, based on the facts they have personally experienced, that without the Communist Party, they would continue to live a miserable life like beasts of burden under the dual oppression of nationality and class, just as in the old society. Precisely because of this, the people of our minority nationalities, together with the people of the whole country, have launched a resolute counterattack against the right-wingers. We believe that in the struggle against the bourgeois right-wingers, the people of all minority nationalities will, together with the people of the whole country, unite more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, and advance more courageously along the broad road of socialism.

After Ulanhu delivered his report, the meeting proceeded with general discussions. Those who spoke today included: Guo Moruo, Huang Xianfan, Chen Jingyu, Zhang Sizhou, Saifudin, Leng Yu, Wu Ruo'an, Liu Wenhui, Li Fudu, Qin Renchang, Cheng Shifan, Xu Deheng, Wang Zhuchen, and others.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a speech entitled "Refuting an Anti-Socialist Scientific Program." He pointed out that the "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System," proposed and published under the name of the Provisional Group for Scientific Planning of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League under the instigation of Zhang Bojun and others, is actually an anti-socialist bourgeois program in the field of scientific work. This is part of the conspiracy of right-wingers such as Zhang Bojun to seize leadership in cultural and educational work.

Guo Moruo pointed out that the opinion paper opposes scientific work serving socialist construction, opposes the planned and focused development of scientific work, and opposes the unified leadership of scientific work. The result is that our country cannot fully utilize the superiority of the socialist system to develop scientific undertakings, and that our country's scientific work will remain in a backward state for a long time.

Guo Moruo then pointed out that the opinions put forward in the opinion paper, "First change the attitude towards bourgeois social sciences" and "Restore" bourgeois social sciences, actually mean that we should first develop bourgeois social sciences instead of developing Marxist social sciences.

Guo Moruo said that the most fundamental weakness in our country's social science research work is that there are too few people in our social science team who can truly creatively use Marxism to study scholarship. Therefore, in order to develop social sciences in the future, the primary task is to continue to expand the Marxist social science team and improve the level of Marxism, rather than developing bourgeois social sciences. The proposition of "restoring" bourgeois social sciences is actually a reversal of progress and opposes the use of Marxism to study social sciences.

Huang Xianfan, professor at Guangxi Normal College, put forward some suggestions on developing the production and cultural education in western Guangxi. He said that the western Guangxi Zhuang area is particularly rich in mineral resources, with a wide distribution of non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, rare metals, and non-metallic minerals. The western Guangxi area has a vast territory and a sparse population, and there is a lot of land that can be utilized. It has good geographical conditions for developing cash crops, local specialties, animal husbandry, and forestry. If the government attaches importance to it and invests in it, and gradually develops and utilizes these open spaces and mineral deposits, it will not only improve the economic conditions of the Zhuang and other minority nationality areas, but also benefit the socialist construction of the motherland. Huang Xianfan also suggested restoring Guangxi University and paying attention to the development of cultural and educational undertakings in minority nationality areas.

Saifudin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that the people of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have achieved unprecedented and tremendous achievements in building a new socialist life. The Autonomous Region has basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce at the beginning of this year, and is steadily carrying out the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Last year, the cultivated land area in the region increased by 2.35 million mu compared with the previous year, and the output of grain, cotton, and oil crops all completed or exceeded the plan. The number of various livestock has also increased. Last year, the industrial output value increased by more than 44% compared with the previous year. In terms of capital construction, a total of more than 460 million yuan was invested, and 536,000 square meters of construction tasks were completed. The autonomous region's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also greatly developed. Saifudin said that these achievements are of historical significance, and any attempt to deny and obliterate these achievements is futile. This is just like the Uygur proverb that says, "The sun cannot be covered by a lapel."

The executive chairmen presiding over today's meeting were: Huang Yanpei, Xu Teli, Ma Yinchu, Liu Geping, Deng Chumin, Hu Yaobang, Ou Baichuan, Guoji Mugu, Mei Lanfang, and Zhou Wenjiang.

Today's meeting started at 3:00 PM and ended at 7:10 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    百分之八十五以上的少数民族地区
    各族人民进入社会主义社会
    乌兰夫在人民代表大会上报告民族政策的伟大成就
    据新华社5日讯　国务院副总理兼民族事务委员会主任乌兰夫今天在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上所作的报告中指出：现在，在我国85％以上的少数民族地区，千百年来受压迫、受痛苦的少数民族农民、农奴和奴隶，已经废除了各种旧制度，开始进入了社会主义社会。
    乌兰夫在会议开始时向大会作了“关于建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的报告”。他在报告中叙述了提交这次大会审议的关于建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区议案的讨论和协商经过，接着指出，民族区域自治是我国根据马克思列宁主义的一般原理和中国的实际情况而采取的解决我国民族问题的基本政策。这一政策已经取得了国内各民族的支持，他们都懂得，只有团结在我国各民族的大家庭——中华人民共和国之内，才能抵抗帝国主义的侵略和威胁，也才能促进各民族共同的进步和发展。
    乌兰夫接着说，到目前为止，建立自治地方的已经有三十一个少数民族，共约二千三百万人口，占全国有条件建立自治地方、聚居的少数民族人口的90％左右。在我国绝大部分少数民族开始进入社会主义社会的时候，少数民族地区的经济和文化已经有了很大的发展。
    乌兰夫严正地驳斥了资产阶级右派分子反对党的民族政策的阴谋和企图。他指出，我国各少数民族人民根据自己亲身感受的事实，已经清楚地看到如果没有共产党，他们就会和在旧社会一样，在民族的和阶级的双重压迫下，继续过那悲惨的牛马生活。正因为这样，我国的少数民族人民才和全国人民一道，向右派分子进行了坚决的反击。我们相信，各少数民族人民在反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，必然会同全国人民一道，更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，更加奋勇地沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进。
    乌兰夫作报告以后，会议进行大会讨论。今天发言的有：郭沫若、黄现璠、陈经畬、张泗洲、赛福鼎、冷遹、吴若安、刘文辉、李赋都、秦仁昌、程士范、许德珩、王祝晨等十三人。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国科学院院长郭沫若在会上作了“驳斥一个反社会主义的科学纲领”的发言。他指出，在章伯钧等人的主使下以民盟中央科学规划临时小组名义提出和发表的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，实际上就是一个在科学工作方面的反社会主义的资产阶级纲领。这是章伯钧等右派分子企图夺取文教工作的领导权的阴谋的一部分。
    郭沫若指出，意见书中反对科学工作为社会主义建设服务，反对有计划有重点地发展科学工作，反对科学工作的统一领导，其结果就是要使我国不能充分利用社会主义制度的优越性来发展科学事业，就是要使我国科学工作长期停留在落后的状态。
    郭沫若接着指出，意见书提出的“首先改变对待资产阶级社会科学的态度”和“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的意见，实际上就是首先要去发展资产阶级的社会科学，而不是发展马克思主义的社会科学。
    郭沫若说，我国社会科学研究工作中最根本的弱点是，我们的社会科学队伍中，能够真正创造性地运用马克思主义来研究学问的人还是太少。因此，今后为了发展社会科学，首先的任务就在于继续扩大马克思主义的社会科学队伍，提高马克思主义的水平，而不是什么发展资产阶级社会科学。那种“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的主张，实际上是开倒车，反对用马克思主义来研究社会科学。
    广西师范学院教授黄现璠对发展桂西生产事业和广西文化教育提出了一些意见。他说，桂西僮族地区矿产特别丰富，有色金属、黑色金属、稀有金属和非金属矿产分布很广。而桂西一带地广人稀，可以利用的土地很多，对发展经济作物、土特产、畜牧和森林等事业有很好的地理条件，若政府予以重视、投资，把这些旷地和矿藏逐步开发利用起来，不独可以改善僮族和其他少数民族地区的经济状况，而且有利于祖国社会主义建设。黄现璠还建议恢复广西大学，注意发展少数民族居住地区的文教事业。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎说，新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民为建设新的社会主义生活已取得了空前巨大的成绩。自治区在今年初已经基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，正在稳步地进行着对畜牧业的社会主义改造。去年，全区耕地面积比前年增加了二百三十五万亩，粮食、棉花和油料作物的产量都完成或超额完成了计划。各种牲畜的头数也有增加。去年工业产值比前年增加了44％以上，基本建设方面，共投资四亿六千多万元，完成了五十三万六千平方公尺的建筑任务。自治区的文教卫生事业也有了很大发展。赛福鼎说，这些成绩是具有历史意义的，任何企图否认与抹煞这些成绩的打算都是徒劳的。这正像维吾尔的俗话所说“用衣襟遮没不了太阳”。
    主持今天会议的执行主席是：黄炎培、徐特立、马寅初、刘格平、邓初民、胡耀邦、欧百川、果基木古、梅兰芳、周文江。
    今天的会议从下午三时开始，七时十分结束。明天，会议将继续举行。
