Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th – According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission, as a result of implementing the first Five-Year Plan, the total output value of Tianjin's local industry has increased from 6.3% of the national industrial output value in 1952 to 8.2%. Consequently, Tianjin's position in the national industry has risen from fourth place in 1952, behind Shanghai, Liaoning, and Jiangsu, to second place, second only to Shanghai.

During the first Five-Year Plan, Tianjin built and expanded more than 400 factories, rapidly transforming the face of Tianjin's industry. If we start from 1867, when Chonghou, the Qing Dynasty's Minister of Trade, established the Tianjin Machine Bureau in Tianjin, Tianjin's modern industry has exactly ninety years of history this year. However, the investment in basic construction of Tianjin's local industry during the first Five-Year Plan alone was nearly one and a half times more than the fixed assets accumulated in the eighty-two years before liberation.

The more than 400 factories newly built and expanded in Tianjin all possess the three major characteristics of spending less money, achieving greater results, and building quickly. Now, three new industrial zones have appeared around the urban area of Tianjin, and many industrial sectors that did not exist in the past or had weak foundations have been established and strengthened. The iron and steel industry, which developed from dilapidated foundations, now has five large-scale steelmaking and steel rolling factories. Although the investment in the iron and steel industry only accounts for slightly more than 5% of the city's industrial investment, it has led to a surge in the output of steel and steel products. This year, the monthly steel production is more than the total production for the entire year of 1952, and the steel products production for every two months exceeds the total production for the entire year of 1952. The machinery industry has also developed from repair and assembly to a veritable manufacturing industry through new construction and expansion during the Five-Year Plan. The machine tool factory, engineering machinery factory, hoisting machinery factory, internal combustion engine factory, forging press factory, boiler factory, and shipbuilding and repair factory, which are the mainstays of Tianjin's machinery industry, have all grown up during the Five-Year Plan. The Tianjin Machine Tool Factory was originally a machine factory that manufactured parts. In addition to using its original riveting workshop to invest in expanding into a boiler manufacturing plant, the state also used the original foundation to expand it into a factory capable of manufacturing precision machine tools, which saved two-thirds of the investment compared to building the same machine tool factory from scratch.

    五年的速度超过八十二年
    天津新建和扩建四百多个工厂
    地方工业总产值跃居全国第二位
    新华社天津20日电　据天津市计划委员会统计，天津市地方工业的总产值经过执行第一个五年计划的结果，已经从1952年占全国工业总产值的6.3％增长到占8.2％。因而天津工业在全国的地位也由1952年次于上海、辽宁和江苏名列第四而升居第二位，仅次于上海了。
    在第一个五年计划中，天津市新建、扩建了四百多个工厂，使天津工业面貌迅速发生了变化。如果从1867年清朝通商大臣崇厚在天津设立天津机器局算起，到今年，天津近代工业正好有了九十年的历史，然而仅仅在第一个五年计划中天津地方工业基本建设的投资，就比解放以前八十二年中所积累的固定资产还多将近一倍半。
    天津市新建、扩建的四百多个工厂几乎都具备花钱少、收效大、建设快的三大特点。现在，在天津市区周围出现了三个新的工业区，很多过去没有的或基础薄弱的工业行业也都建立和壮大了。从破旧基础上发展起来的钢铁工业，现在已经有五个规模较大的炼钢和轧钢工厂，虽然钢铁工业的投资只占全市工业投资的5％多，却使钢和钢材产量激增。今年，每一个月的钢产量比1952年全年产量还多，每两个月的钢材产量也超过1952年全年的产量。机械工业在五年计划中经过新建和扩建，也从修配发展到名副其实的制造工业。作为天津市机械工业主力的机床厂、工程机械厂、起重机械厂、内燃机械厂、锻压机床厂、锅炉厂和船舶修造厂等，都是在五年计划中成长起来的。天津市机床厂原来是一个制造配件的机器厂，国家除了利用它原来的铆造车间投资扩建成锅炉制造厂以外，又利用原有基础扩建成现在能够制造精密机床的工厂，这比新建同样的机床厂要节省投资三分之二。
