Long Yun said his anti-Soviet, anti-communist remarks were due to his "high blood pressure, which makes me prone to impulsiveness." That "high blood pressure" can lead one to oppose the Soviet Union and oppose communism is probably a new problem that the medical community has not yet discovered.

Some people, when caught off guard, like the person in the movie "The Magic Chair" sitting on the magic chair, will say things that they usually keep hidden in their hearts. But the magic chair can at most make him say what is already in his heart, but it cannot create words for him. If the cage is opened and a vicious tiger jumps out, it is because there is a tiger in the cage. If there were only doves originally, the cage door could be left open all day and no tiger would jump out. Long Yun's understanding is different from common sense. He believes that the reason a tiger jumps out of the cage is because the cage originally contained doves. For example, he said his motive for opposing the Soviet Union was "patriotism."

Whether Long Yun suffers from "high blood pressure" physiologically, I do not know. However, he suffers from political high blood pressure. This disease is a common ailment of all right-wingers, or what could be called a right-wing occupational disease. This is a chronic disease, which has been around for quite some time. During this period, influenced by the political climate, that is, stimulated by what they call "the situation on the eve of the Polish and Hungarian events," it suddenly intensified, and they all became greatly "impulsive," acting like they had a stroke.

People immediately took action to save them from their critical condition. But they avoid treatment and refuse to tell the true source of their illness. Doctors hold the heart of treating diseases and saving people, on one hand, they must be ruthless in their acupuncture, and on the other hand, they must spend time and effort patiently with this kind of malignant disease. But what doctors ask of patients is to honestly tell the source of the disease, so that they can be saved. See, haven't some people already begun to escape danger because of this? Otherwise, what awaits them will be political death, which should arouse serious attention from patients.

### 龙云的“高血压”症

    龙云的“高血压”症
  　侠人
    龙云说他的反苏、反共言论是由于他“血压过高，容易冲动”。“血压过高”竟能致人反苏、反共，这恐怕是医学界还没有发现的新问题。
    有些人当失于戒备的时候，例如像电影“魔椅”里的人坐上魔椅那样，就会说出内心的见不得人的话来。但魔椅至多也只能使他说出内心已有的话，却不能替他造话。笼门开了，跳出了一只恶虎，这还是因为笼里有虎，笼里原有的倘是鸽子，就是整天笼门大开，也不会跳出虎来。龙云的见识却与一般人的常识不同。他认为笼里所以跳出虎来，是由于笼里原装的是鸽子。例如他说他反苏的动机是“爱国”。
    龙云在生理上是否患有“高血压”症，我不知道。不过，他是患有政治上的高血压症的。这种病是一切右派分子的通病，或者叫作右派职业病。这是一种慢性病，由来颇久，这个时期，受到政治气候的影响，即他们所谓的“波匈事件前夕的形势”的刺激，突然加剧，于是便都大大地“冲动”了起来，活像是急中风。
    人们立即动手来挽救他们于垂危。他们却又讳疾忌医，不肯说出真的病源来。医生是持有治病救人之心的，一面要对病人痛下针砭，这绝不能手软；一面要耐心对这种恶症花出时间和工夫。但医生求之于病人的是要他们老实地说出病源来，这样他们便能得救了，试看有些人不是已因此开始脱险了吗？否则等待他们的将是政治上的死亡，这是应该引起患者严重注意的。
