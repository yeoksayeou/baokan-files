People's Daily, July 3rd News—At an expanded symposium convened today by the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Bojun, chairman of the party, admitted to the existence of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance and acknowledged their anti-Communist, anti-socialist political ambitions. Zhang Bojun made these admissions under the pressure of vehement accusations and numerous interrogations at the meeting.

Zhang Bojun said:

Today, I stand before you as someone who has committed serious political crimes. I am a person with political ambitions, a bourgeois rightist ambitious element. I have my own set of ideas, developed after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, evolving from the past Third Line. I have a complete set of thoughts and a complete set of practices, namely, the practices you have pointed out involving conspiracy, a program, plans, and steps. I particularly value two things from capitalist countries: their scientific production technology and their democratic freedom. I have praised capitalism on many occasions, saying that capitalism has vitality and has things that can be used and emulated.

From Ideological Alliance to Political Alliance

Zhang Bojun said: From this standpoint, since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, I have negated the revolutionary forces of the Soviet Union, negated Stalin's achievements, and made many bad remarks criticizing the Soviet Union. I underestimated the Soviet Union, underestimated its achievements, believing that the Soviet Union had heavy industry but no old culture.

Speaking of the Zhang-Luo alliance, Zhang Bojun said that the Zhang-Luo alliance is a fact, starting last year. In the past, I competed with Luo for power and profit within the league, but cooperation began last year. It started with an ideological alliance. Ideologically, I have bourgeois right-leaning thoughts, and Luo has Anglo-American democratic thoughts; our ideas are consistent. From an ideological alliance to consistent work, that is, a working alliance, and then to a political alliance. Is there a political program? There is no specific program written into specific articles. The alliance is common and for personal political ambitions. Because the China Democratic League is a group of great intellectuals, I wanted to influence the great intellectuals through Luo Longji. An alliance with Luo Longji could gain the support of the great intellectuals. Luo Longji had a small group in the past, and he was opposed to me. Last year, my thinking changed, and I openly advocated the Western democratic system, which conformed to their thinking, and they began to approach me. Last year, at the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League, or perhaps it was the Third Session of the National People's Congress, I invited Luo's friends, such as Ma Zhimin, Pan Dakui, Peng Dixian, and Shen Zhiyuan. During the talks, I talked about my set of theories, such as democratic politics, the parliamentary system, etc., completely pulling Chairman Mao's political theory to Anglo-American parliamentary politics, and they fully supported me. Shen Zhiyuan is engaged in Marxism-Leninism, and he was also confused. Thus, the political alliance of the Zhang-Luo alliance began to take effect.

After this, Luo did not oppose me in the China Democratic League, and I did not oppose him in anything. The two were in perfect agreement. For example, Luo Longji proposed a set of plans for dealing with unemployed intellectuals to the CPPCC, and I agreed. Luo proposed the establishment of an Intellectuals Committee in the CPPCC, and I supported him, proposing it as a suggestion from the central committee of the China Democratic League.

Also, regarding the Cultural Club, it was originally said that the United Front Work Department would take it back and hand it over to other scientific institutions. Luo opposed it, and I also expressed my support. In the management of the Cultural Club, Luo had disputes with Shi Liang, and I took a laissez-faire attitude to support Luo Longji.

At the working conference of the China Democratic League, I cooperated very well with him, and we also cooperated very well in running publications. For example, I originally intended to run "Zhengming" myself, but later, according to the division of labor, I gave it to him to run, and he was very satisfied, using this publication as a forum for great intellectuals.

In the arrangement of personnel in the leadership of the China Democratic League, Luo arranged for Fei Xiaotong to be in the Culture and Education Department and Zeng Zhaolun to be in the Culture and Education Committee, and I agreed. Luo wanted to arrange for Chen Xingui to go to Guangming Daily, and I also agreed.

In terms of political exchange of opinions, there were disputes in the past, but since last year, we have had few disputes.

Last year, the China Democratic League inspected the work of the League's Central Committee and made 150 suggestions, many of which were directed at me personally. Luo Longji wanted to deal with it while I was abroad. This was him protecting me.

As for the places where Luo had influence in various localities and the people he contacted, I did not directly contact them. As for Wang Zaoshi, he came to me twice, talking about the restoration of the National Salvation Association.

The most egregious thing was after the start of the rectification movement, that is, the four groups for scientific planning, the party committee system in universities, etc. This was initiated by me because I was in charge of culture and education. At that time, many symposiums were held, and the China Democratic League also held symposiums. There were these four groups convened by the League's Central Committee, and more than a dozen symposiums were organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League.

The division of labor for each group was as follows: Shi Liang and I were in charge of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" group, Luo was in charge of the "Those with Positions but No Power" group, Fei Xiaotong was in charge of the Party Committee System group, and Zeng Zhaolun was in charge of the Scientific Planning group. This shows my alliance with Luo in my work practices. Only one of these groups held a meeting; the other three groups did not.

Conspiring to Separate Democratic Parties from the Leadership of the Party

Zhang Bojun said: In Beidaihe, Shi Liang, Gao Chongmin, Luo Longji, and Deputy Secretary-General Ye Duyi of the China Democratic League often held meetings together. Luo did not go to my residence, and I did not go to Luo's residence. In Beidaihe, we talked about the issue of intellectuals, about the issues of counter-suppression and rehabilitation. I talked about this issue at the symposium, releasing the great intellectuals in labor camps and changing them from manual labor to mental labor.

I discussed with Luo Longji how to run the China Democratic League, the 150 issues, and the leadership core of the China Democratic League. I said that Shen Lao is old, Vice Chairman Ma Xulun is ill, and the four vice-chairmen and Secretary-General Hu Yuzhi should be the leadership core, with the vice-chairmen taking turns contacting the United Front Work Department for two months each. This year, Luo Longji proposed that Shen be made honorary chairman, I be the first vice-chairman, and Luo be the second vice-chairman. Now the democratic parties are independent and no longer the tail of the Communist Party. Luo said, "I'll come to the meeting if you come, and I'll do whatever you want to do." As for letting the other old gentlemen do less work, that's what I advocate.

I have scolded the Communist Party a lot, mainly for having positions but no power. I am a two-faced person, flattering to their faces and cursing behind their backs. I am shameless. I have my own ambitions for intellectuals, but I have not discussed them with Luo Longji.

I have a set of political ambitions, which is to raise my own political status, not to become an official, but to realize my political propositions. I have an article that makes it very clear, which is my speech at the CPPCC meeting in March. I said that I love the Communist Party and also love the democratic parties. I love socialism and also love democracy. After Wang Zaoshi read it, he thought these two sentences were very good. I separate democracy from socialism, always believing that the Soviet system lacks some democracy. I strongly oppose dogmatism, mainly because I am dissatisfied with the Communist Party's proletarian dictatorship. This idea is not only the same as Luo's, but also the same as Chu Anping's and Xu Zhucheng's of Wenhui Daily.

I always feel that the West has science and technology and democracy. This is revisionism and is very dangerous. I was influenced by Yugoslavia, the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and the Polish and Hungarian events. I admire the democratic parties after the Polish October events; they have achieved something. I feel that the Communist Party has been managing the democratic parties very tightly in the past, especially the local governments, and the cadres are all arranged by the Communist Party, which I am very dissatisfied with. Therefore, after the Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence, I thought that the democratic parties had a great future.

Instructing Rightist Elements to Incite Trouble Everywhere

Zhang Bojun said: After the symposium of the China Democratic League, I thought the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should also do it. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held four symposiums, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League arranged more than a dozen symposiums. I said that the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party would not do it, but the Beijing Municipal Committee would do it. I discussed the way to do it with Li Boqiu of the Beijing Municipal Committee. In this work, we can contact some of the masses. After this work is carried out, we can develop the organization and absorb representative figures from all aspects.

I am responsible in three positions (China Democratic League, Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Guangming Daily). I bear more responsibility for making mistakes. My guidance in all aspects is to give suggestions to the Communist Party, which is also to incite trouble. My political attempt is to develop the organization and expand my political influence.

The list for the Beijing symposium was drafted by Li Boqiu and shown to me. I wanted Li Boqiu to do the work in Beijing, saying that the Central Committee would be in charge of me and Huang Qixiang, and Beijing had great potential. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party could develop three to five thousand members in Beijing. If you do a good job in Beijing, I will suggest that you be the deputy mayor of Beijing during the consultation in the future. I once told Li Boqiu that at a certain time I could suggest that Li Boqiu be the deputy mayor because Li Boqiu was dissatisfied, had political demands, felt that his position in the party was not high enough, and felt that he was not properly arranged.

On the afternoon of June 5, Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, and Hu Yuzhi came to my house after a meeting of the "Scientific Planning" working group of the China Democratic League, saying that there was something important to discuss. Qian Weichang talked about the situation of the students at Tsinghua University. He said, "Is it time to release or收？The Tsinghua University Party Committee can no longer maintain it. If we continue to release and ignore it, and want to 收, then we will 来收". Fei Xiaotong also talked about the situation of the Nationalities Institute. Zeng Zhaolun also said, "The situation now is that it has been raised all over the country. The students in Shanghai are making a lot of noise. This morning, Yang Xiufeng went to Shanghai to deal with the problem. I told him that you can go to Shanghai to talk to the负责人 of the China Democratic League, who can help you". The meaning is that the China Democratic League plays a role in the rectification movement in schools. Zeng Zhaolun also said, "The political design institute you talked about is opposed by people outside, but I admire it. Today, the situation in Beijing is very serious. Students may take to the streets, and the citizens are also dissatisfied. The combination of students and citizens is the Hungarian incident". At that time, I agreed with their views, and the assessment of the situation was so serious. That day, we decided: to find a few more people to talk to the next day, and I would tell Premier Zhou. That evening, I called Xi Zhongxun and Li Weihan, but I couldn't get through.

On the morning of June 6, we met again at the CPPCC Cultural Club. This time, Huang Yaomian, Shi Liang, Wu Jingchao, and Tao Dayong were added. Everyone repeated the situation of the previous day. Wu Jingchao did not think the situation was so serious. After the meeting, Shi Liang's opinion was to ask for instructions from the leaders and talk to Premier Zhou, and said to mention it when meeting with Premier Zhou in the afternoon.

On the 7th, the State Council held a meeting. Shi Liang said to me that she had talked to Premier Zhou the night before, and the Premier did not comment. She asked me to talk to the Premier again. At the meeting, I wrote a note to the Premier, saying that the situation was very serious, and the attitude of the people who talked was quite sincere, etc. The Premier also did not express his opinion.

From my own point of view, I agree with their assessment of the situation and agree to talk to the Communist Party. I think the democratic parties can still play a role. As for who lit the fire, it is difficult to say. If my anti-Party, anti-socialist speeches incited the emotions of the masses, that is another issue. To be honest, I did not directly order or directly instruct to light the fire. If it is found out in the future, I will be even more guilty.

Zhang and Luo Planned Separately, Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily Echoed Each Other

Zhang Bojun said: About the Guangming Daily issue. Everyone knows Chu Anping's newspaper management ideas, and I support him. I support him in reporting more about the democratic parties, more about the science and technology news of capitalist countries, the activities of social democratic parties in democratic countries, and the activities of the leaders of the democratic parties. I also agreed with Chu Anping to send reporters to major cities to hold symposiums. Chu Anping said that in the past, Guangming Daily could not do news independently, and we should do something different from Xinhua News Agency. I also agree with this. This has changed the socialist direction of Guangming Daily. As for the entire reorganization of Guangming, Chu Anping is preparing to wait and see, to clarify the situation before making a decision.

I met Chu Anping last year. At first, I invited him to join the editorial board of "Zhengming". Chu Anping did not go to Guangming Daily until April this year. During this period, Chu Anping and I had contact, and also had contact with Luo Longji. Luo Longji's relationship with Chu Anping was earlier than mine. When Chu Anping went to Guangming Daily, Luo Longji talked to him about the newspaper management policy. So, what is the relationship between Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and Zhang Bojun? Our thinking is the same on the capitalist road of Guangming Daily. There is no direct consultation, but indirect mutual contact, and mutual political influence.

I will also talk about the issue of Wenhui Daily taking the capitalist road. Before Wenhui Daily was relaunched, I had talked to Xu Zhucheng about the newspaper management policy, and there were also some contacts after the relaunch. I have no relationship with Pu Xixiu, only one contact. That was on the night of June 8, the day Chu Anping proposed to resign to me. Pu Xixiu called me to ask three things:

First, is the news of Chu Anping's resignation confirmed, and what is my attitude? I said that the power is not in my hands and that it will be decided after discussion at the community affairs meeting.

Second, can I write an article for Wenhui Daily on the issue of a coalition government? I said I wouldn't do it. She asked again: Can you introduce someone to write it? I said, I can't think of anyone for a while, it has to be someone who has some political research, like Wang Tieyai.

Third, Pu Xixiu told me two pieces of news: one was that she ran into Zhou Yang and Xia Yan at the Yugoslav embassy and asked about the issue of ming and fang, and they said it was still fang. The other was that she called Lu Dingyi and asked if it was to continue fang or to 收. Lu Dingyi replied: We are still fang, there is no change.

Zhang Bojun said that Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily influence each other.

### 农工民主党座谈会上群情激愤严词质问  章伯钧承认章罗联盟

    农工民主党座谈会上群情激愤严词质问
    章伯钧承认章罗联盟
    本报3日讯　农工民主党主席章伯钧今天在农工民主党中央执行局召集的扩大座谈会上承认章伯钧—罗隆基联盟的事实，承认他们反共、反社会主义的政治野心。章伯钧是在会上群情激愤和纷纷质问之下交代的。
    章伯钧说：
    今天，我以在政治上犯了严重罪行的人的身份站在你们面前。我是一个在政治上抱有野心的人，是资产阶级右派野心分子。我自己思想上有一套，是从苏共二十次代表大会以后发展起来的，从过去的第三条路线发展起来的。我有整套的想法，有整套的作法，即大家所指出的有阴谋、有纲领、有计划和有步骤的作法。我特别看重资本主义国家的两点，一是它的科学生产技术，一是它的民主自由。我在许许多的场合都歌颂资本主义，说资本主义有生命力，有可用可仿效的地方。
    从思想联盟到政治联盟
    章伯钧说：从这个立场上，从苏共二十次代表大会以后，我否定了苏联革命力量，否定了斯大林的功绩，对苏联的批评有很多不好的言论。对苏联估计过低，成绩估计过少，认为苏联有重工业，但没有旧的文化。
    谈到章罗联盟，章伯钧说，章罗联盟是有事实的，是从去年开始的。过去同罗在盟内争权夺利，从去年开始合作。先从思想联盟开始。我思想上是资产阶级右倾思想，罗有英美民主思想，我们思想一致。从思想联盟到工作一致，即工作联盟，再变为政治上的联盟。是否有政治纲领呢？具体纲领与写成具体条文的是没有的。联盟是共同的，是为了个人的政治野心。因为民盟是大知识分子的集团，我想通过罗隆基影响大知识分子，同罗隆基联盟可以取得大知识分子的支持。罗隆基过去有一个小集团，他同我是反对的。去年我思想变化，公开主张西方民主的一套，符合他们的思想，他们就开始同我接近。去年民盟第二次代表大会，也不知道是人大第三次会议的时候，我请了罗的朋友，如马哲民、潘大逵、彭迪先、沈志远等人。在谈话时，我谈我的一套理论，如民主政治、议会制等等，把毛主席的政治理论完全扯到英美议会政治上去，他们完全拥护我的。沈志远是搞马列主义的，他也受到迷惑了。这样章罗联盟的政治联盟就开始起效果了。
    在这以后，罗在民盟没有什么地方反对我，我也没有什么地方反对他。两人心心相印。如罗隆基提出处理失业知识分子的一套方案交政协，我同意。罗提出在政协要成立知识分子委员会，我支持他，作为民盟中央的建议提出。
    再有文化俱乐部，本来说统战部要收回交给其他科学机关，罗反对，我也表示支持。在文化俱乐部管理上，罗同史良有争论，我采取不管的态度来支持了罗隆基。
    在民盟工作会议上，我跟他合作得很好，在办刊物上也合作得很好。如“争鸣”我原来打算自己办，后来按照分工给他办，他很满意，以这个刊物作为大知识分子的论坛了。
    在民盟领导机构安排人事上，罗把费孝通安排在文教部，把曾昭抡安排在文教委员会，我同意。罗要把陈新桂安排到光明日报，我也同意。
    在政治上交换意见，过去有争论，从去年以来我们两人就不大有争论。
    去年民盟检查盟中央工作，提了一百五十条意见，其中有很多是对我个人的。罗隆基想在我出国期间把它处理掉。这是他包庇我。
    至于各地方罗影响的地方，他联系的人，我没有直接联系。至于王造时找过我两次，谈过恢复救国会的事。
    极恶劣的地方是在整风开始以后，就是搞科学规划、高等学校党委制等四个小组。这是我发动的，因为我管文教。当时开了很多座谈会，民盟也搞了座谈会。由盟中央召开的有这四个小组，由民盟北京市委员会组织了十几个座谈会。
    各小组的分工是这样的，由我同史良主持百家争鸣小组，罗主持有职无权小组，费孝通主持党委制小组，曾昭抡主持科学规划小组。这表示我在工作上同罗联盟的作法。这些小组只有一个小组开过会，三个小组没有开会。
     阴谋使民主党派脱离党的领导
    章伯钧说：我在北戴河同民盟副主席史良、高崇民、罗隆基和副秘书长叶笃义时常在一起开会。罗没有到我的住处去，我也没有到罗的住处去。在北戴河谈过知识分子问题，谈到肃反和平反问题。我在座谈会上谈过这个问题，把在劳改中的大知识分子释放，由从事体力劳动改为从事脑力劳动。
    我与罗隆基谈过民盟如何搞的问题，一百五十条问题，民盟的领导核心问题。我说沈老年纪大了，马叙伦副主席有病，由四个副主席和秘书长胡愈之作为领导核心，副主席轮流每人两个月同统战部接触。今年，罗隆基提出由沈作名誉主席，我作第一副主席，罗作第二副主席，现在民主党派独立，不做共产党的尾巴了。罗说，“开会你来我就来，只要你要作的我就作。”至于让其他的老先生少作些事，我是这样主张的。
    我骂共产党是很多的，主要是有职无权。我是个两面派，当面捧场，背后骂娘。我是无耻。对知识分子我有我的野心，没有跟罗隆基谈。
    我有一套政治野心，就是抬高自己的政治地位，不是为作官，是为了实现我的政治主张。我有篇文章说得很清楚，就是3月间我在政协会议上的发言。我说我爱护共产党，也爱护民主党派。我爱社会主义，也爱民主。王造时看了以后，认为这两句很好。我把民主与社会主义分开，总是认为苏联的制度缺少一些民主。我极力反对教条主义，主要是不满意共产党的无产阶级专政。这个思想不仅和罗相同，而且和储安平相同，和文汇报的徐铸成相同。
    我总觉得西方有科学技术，有民主。这是修正主义，是很危险的。我是受了南斯拉夫的影响，苏共二十次大会的影响，波匈事件的影响。我对波兰十月事件以后的民主党派很欣赏，他们有所作为。我感觉过去共产党对民主党派管的很紧，特别是地方管的很紧，干部都是共产党代为安排的，我很不满意。因此共产党提出长期共存的方针以后，我以为民主党派大有作为了。
    指使右派分子到处点火
    章伯钧说：民盟座谈会以后，我认为农工民主党也要做。民盟中央搞了四个座谈会，民盟北京市委布置了十几个座谈会。我说，农工民主党中央不搞了，由北京市委搞。搞的方式同北京市委的李伯球谈过。在这个工作中可以联系些群众。这个工作进行以后，就可以发展组织，把各方面的代表性人物吸收进来。
    我在三个岗位（民盟、农工、光明日报）都是负责的。犯了错误我负有更多的责任。我各方面的指导向共产党提意见，也就是点火。我在政治上的企图是发展组织，扩大我的政治影响。
    北京市座谈会是李伯球拟的名单，是给我看过的。我要李伯球搞北京的工作，说中央由我同黄琪翔负责，北京市大有可为。农工在北京市发展三千、五千，你在北京市好好干一下，将来协商时，我建议你当北京市副市长。我曾经和李伯球说过，到一定时期我可以建议叫李伯球做副市长，因为李伯球有不满，在政治上有要求，感到党内地位不够高，感到没有安排适当。
    6月5日下午，曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通、胡愈之四个人在民盟的“科学规划”工作组开会后到家里来找我，说有重要的事情要商量。钱伟长讲了清华大学学生的情况，他说：“现在是放，还是收？清华大学党委已不能维持了，如果继续放我们不管，要收那我们就来收”。费孝通也谈了一下民族学院的情况。曾昭抡也说了，他说：“现在的情况是全国各地都搞起来了，上海的学生闹得很厉害。今天上午，杨秀峰到上海去处理问题，我告诉他，你到上海可以找民盟的负责人谈谈，可以帮助你”。意思是说，民盟对学校的整风起作用。曾昭抡又说：“你讲的政治设计院，外边有人反对，我倒是很欣赏。今天北京的情况很严重，学生有可能上街，市民也不满意，学生同市民结合起来就是匈牙利事件”。当时，我同意他们的见解，对形势的估计是这样严重。当天，我们决定：第二天再多找几个人谈谈，并由我告诉周总理。当天晚间，我曾给习仲勋、李维汉打电话，但是没有接上头。
    6日上午，我们又在政协文化俱乐部见面了。这次增加了黄药眠、史良、吴景超和陶大镛。大家又把头一天的情况说了一下，吴景超估计的形势没有那样严重。会后，史良的意见是请示领导，找周总理谈，并且说下午和周总理见面时说一下。
    7日，国务院开会。史良对我说，前一天晚上已和周总理谈了，总理未置可否，她叫我再和总理谈一谈。在会上，我写了条子给总理，说情况很严重，谈话的人的态度颇为诚恳等等。总理也未表示可否。
    从我自己来说，是同意他们对形势的估计的，并且同意和共产党的方面谈一谈，我觉得民主党派还可以发挥一些作用。至于是谁点火的问题，那很难说。如果说，由于我的反党、反社会主义的讲话，煽动了群众的情绪，那是另一个问题。老实说，我直接下命令、直接授意点火，是没有的。如果将来查出来，我就是罪加一等了。
    章罗分头策划　文汇光明互相呼应
    章伯钧说：关于光明日报的问题。储安平的办报思想大家都知道，我是支持他的。我支持他多报道民主党派，多报道资本主义国家的科学技术新闻，民主国家社会党的活动，民主党派负责人的活动。我也同意储安平派记者到各大城市去搞座谈会。储安平说，过去光明日报不能独立地搞新闻，我们要搞和新华社不一样的。这一点，我也同意。这就使得光明日报的社会主义方向改变了。至于光明整个改组的问题，储安平准备再等一等，弄清情况再说。
    我认识储安平是在去年。起初，我邀请他参加“争鸣”的编委会，今年4月储安平才去光明日报。在这个期间，储安平和我有接触，也和罗隆基有接触。罗隆基和储安平的关系比我早，储安平到光明日报去，罗隆基对他谈了办报方针。那么，究竟罗隆基、储安平和章伯钧是怎么个关系呢？对于光明日报的资本主义路线，我们的思想是共同的，没有直接协商，是间接的互相联系，是在政治上相互影响的。
    关于文汇报走资本主义道路问题我也谈一下。文汇报复刊以前，我曾和徐铸成谈了办报的方针，复刊后也有所接触。浦熙修和我没有什么关系，只有一次接触。那是6月8日储安平向我提出辞职的那一天夜里。浦熙修打电话给我问三件事：
    第一，储安平辞职的消息是否确实，并问我的态度如何？我说，权不在我，将来社务会议讨论后再决定。
    第二，关于联合政府问题能否给文汇报写篇文章？我说我不干。她又问：能否介绍一个人写？我说，我一时想不出来，这要对政治有些研究的人，像王铁崖那样的。
    第三，浦熙修告诉我两个消息：一个是她在南斯拉夫大使馆碰到周扬和夏衍，曾问了鸣、放的问题，他们讲还是放。另一个是她曾打电话给陆定一，问是继续放、是收。陆定一答复是：我们还是放，没有变。
    章伯钧说，文汇报和光明日报是互相影响的。
