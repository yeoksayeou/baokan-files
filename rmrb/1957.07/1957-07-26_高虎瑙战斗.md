The battle of Guangchang allowed the Kuomintang to use artillery to knock open the northern gate of the Central Soviet Area, occupying Guangchang City, and continuing to advance towards our hinterland with heavy troops along the Guangchang-Shicheng line. The pain of the first four "encirclement and suppression" campaigns made the enemy extremely cautious. As soon as hundreds of thousands of people stepped into the red area, they were trembling, as if every inch of land was spewing flames. They adopted a step-by-step, fortress warfare tactic, building bunkers while advancing, only managing to move two or three *li* per day on average. It was spring of 1934, with continuous rain, and overflowing mountains and rivers, which further slowed the enemy's pace. The Red Army seized this gap and reorganized in the area south of Guangchang, around Toubei.

At that time, I was the political commissar of the 13th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 3rd Army Group. This regiment was part of the Red 7th Army that came from the Baise Uprising in Guangxi, having fought in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi, and participated in the battles to smash the enemy's four "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. The regiment had many party members, many veteran soldiers, and strong combat effectiveness. It had once annihilated a main regiment of the 19th Route Army in Fujian in an hour of battle, using all of its Czech-style weapons to improve its own equipment. After participating in the Guangchang Campaign, the 13th Regiment rested in Banqiao Town, south of Toubei.

Soon, we received orders for deployment. The 3rd Army Group was tasked with defending the vast area south of Toubei and north of Shicheng. Our 5th Division was positioned between the 5th Army Group and the 4th Division, and the 13th Regiment was responsible for defending Gao Huna and Wangtuzhai on the east side of Banqiao Town, which was the only way for the enemy to go from Guangchang to Shicheng. To our east was the defense zone of the 4th Division, and west of Banqiao Town was defended by the troops of the 5th Army Group. In order to defend the Soviet regime, defend the land, and smash the enemy's fifth encirclement and suppression campaign, we would fight the invading enemy on such a vast front! Although it was the first time to fight a positional defense war, because the previous four counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns had been victorious, everyone was still full of confidence and high morale.

One day, Army Commander Peng Dehuai personally came to our regimental headquarters, followed by Comrade Li Tianyou, the commander of the 5th Division, and Comrade Chen Hejin, the division's political commissar. He called me and Regiment Commander Huang Zhen to look at the positions together. The army commander said: Gao Huna is strategically located and is an important component of the entire defense zone, and the enemy will definitely fight hard to seize it. Then, he explained in detail how the positions should be deployed, how the troops should be used, and how the fortifications should be constructed.... We all felt that the superiors' arrangements were very correct, and we could not raise any objections. The army commander immediately warned us, "This won't work. You should consider a better combat plan yourselves. You are the ones who will fight the battle."

Next, intense preparations began. At that time, the division leaders came to the front line every day, and Army Commander Peng came every day or two to inspect every fortification and every firing port. Under their strict requirements, the fortifications were constantly being revised and strengthened. The troops were discussing and practicing day and night; practicing and discussing.

These ten days were indeed tense and exhausting, but our fortifications were built firmly, not only on the Gao Huna and Wangtuzhai positions, but also in the hearts of the soldiers!

The afternoon after finishing the preparations, the sound of exploding shells suddenly rang out on the positions, and the soil on the fortifications was shaken off. We rushed out of the regimental command post and saw black smoke rolling on the hilltop, and many shells exploding in mid-air. The green and yellow smoke lingered in the air, and even the setting sun changed its color. "Could it be starting tonight?" We looked at each other. After a very brief conversation, we immediately came to this conclusion: The enemy dares not fight at night. This is just testing the artillery. The real attack will be tomorrow.

"Yes, at dawn tomorrow!" Regiment Commander Huang Zhen decisively chopped his hand and shouted, "Communicator, order all battalions to enter the positions at 4:00 a.m.!"

As soon as dawn broke, more than ten enemy planes flew in with rumbling thunder-like sounds. The bombs dropped by the enemy planes fell like a flock of black crows on the positions, immediately stirring up a cloud of dust. The ground under our feet was shaking. One batch flew away, and another batch came. Then, artillery fire began from the opposite mountain. Gao Huna and the positions of neighboring units were immediately plunged into a sea of smoke and fire. The rain-like shells almost lifted the hilltop. The entire earth seemed to be collapsing and sinking in a heavy explosion....

Before the enemy attacks, they will definitely carry out artillery bombardment. However, we did not expect it to be so dense and so fierce. The regiment commander anxiously walked back and forth in the fortifications. Chief of Staff Lu Shaowu was constantly talking to the 3rd and 2nd Battalions in turns, shouting until his face was red and his neck was thick. We were concentrating on detecting the enemy's movements from the sound of the enemy's artillery and the chief of staff's shouts. Suddenly, Chief of Staff Lu slammed the telephone, blew into it, and shook it, and finally put down the microphone in frustration and sighed, "The telephone line is broken!"

I turned to the regiment commander and said, "I'll go take a look at the 2nd Battalion."

The sun had already risen, but it was dimmed by the smoke. The command post was at the foot of the back mountain of Wangtuzhai, and it only took two hundred meters of climbing up the hillside to reach the 2nd Battalion's positions. In the smoke-filled air, I jumped from one shell crater to another. The shell craters were warm, and the soil and stones were blackened by the explosives, giving off a pungent smell of burning. I inspected the soldiers' combat readiness by walking along the trenches to various fortifications. The fortifications were silent. The soldiers were tightly gripping their guns and grenades, their heads and bodies covered with gray soil, their faces as pale as the gray soil, and pairs of eyes silently watching the enemy, leaning against the earthen walls of the fortifications, not moving, not speaking. The fortifications were strongly built, and very few had collapsed. In this respect, it can be said that the enemy wasted a lot of shells.

This went on for more than two hours. Suddenly, I noticed that the impact points of the shells were gradually shifting to the rear of the first-line fortifications. I was wondering when the flag signal soldier of the battalion headquarters rushed into the concealment, and hurriedly reported, "The regimental headquarters is sending a flag signal: The enemy is about to attack, prepare to shoot!" At this time, I heard shouts from the foot of the opposite mountain. Liang Jisheng, the 2nd Battalion Commander, immediately issued an order: "Enter the firing position!" I saw the soldiers stand up, lightly patting the dirt off their bodies, and take out their weapons from their chests.

Through the observation hole, I could observe the enemy's attack. In front of the Gao Huna position, the enemy was very dense, possibly with two divisions of troops. Obviously, the enemy wanted to seize this commanding height. In front of Wangtuzhai, there was about one division of troops. And from the east and west, the shouts of the enemy charging were heard.

I looked at my watch. The enemy started their attack at exactly nine o'clock.

The enemy quickly entered our firing range. Suddenly, the rough tones of the heavy machine guns howled; soon, the crisp voices of many light machine guns sang together, and the mortars tapped out the rhythm with drum beats. On the battlefield, the sound of our guns and cannons was more exciting and inspiring than any pleasant music. I saw the soldiers concentrating on shooting, very different from their state when they were hit by the shells.

Although our short-range firepower was fierce, it could not completely suppress the enemy. Although many enemies fell, the survivors still surged upwards. They quickly reached the vicinity of our *chevaux de frise*. At this time, the Blue Shirts Society members who rushed to the front suddenly appeared in this situation: They jumped up and down on tiptoes, screaming shrilly, as if standing on a red-hot iron plate. The main force behind, probably because they were about to rush to our positions, were in particularly high spirits. They only cared about rushing forward, stepping over the fallen people. Thus, batch after batch rolled down. The rampant charging sound immediately turned into a shrill cry. Like the waves rushing onto the beach, although the momentum was fierce, they finally crashed into the chaotic rocks and gravel.

At this time, black smoke suddenly rose from the front of the Gao Huna position, followed by the sound of "poong, poong, poong" explosions, like thousands of drums beating at the same time. I understood what was going on. The Second Battalion Commander immediately sent soldiers to throw grenades at the throwing holes. Although bullets were scarce, there were plenty of homemade grenades, which were convenient to throw with a hemp rope tail. Our proud enemy had now turned into loaches, squeezing and rolling around in the 30-40 meter area in front of the outer trench, jumping and yelling, crying and screaming. Unexpectedly, the "secondary defensive objects" instructed to be laid by the army commander had produced such a huge effect! Now, our grenades were helping these crowded enemies solve their "disputes": thus, the noisy ones fell silent, the jumping ones became quiet, and everyone lay down in various poses. Those enemies who had not yet entered the bamboo spike zone had to hurriedly roll down the mountain. The enemy's first dense formation charge ended with leaving countless corpses behind.

Our fortifications became lively. The soldiers were busy going to the front of the positions to capture the wounded prisoners and collect firearms and ammunition. I told the Second Battalion Commander to quickly reorganize the troops and prepare for the enemy's second charge, and then crawled out of the fortifications. Only then did I notice that the enemy's artillery fire was intense, and shells flew overhead with screams. Looking around, in the place where the First Battalion was assembled, thick smoke hung in the low air like a yellow curtain, and nothing could be seen. It looked like hundreds of shells had landed there. As the reserve team, the First Battalion did not build any strong fortifications, but only dug some shelters. I wondered if they could withstand this artillery fire. Thinking of this, I felt as if I had stepped on empty ground, and my heart suddenly sank. I hurriedly ran down the mountain.

As soon as I entered the command post, I heard the regiment commander shouting to the communications director: "Quickly ask the First Battalion to report the exact number of casualties!" His face was sallow, his forehead was covered with sweat, and his lips were trembling slightly. At a glance, I knew that the situation was very serious.

Suddenly, a soldier almost rolled into the command post, covered in smoke and fire. I recognized him as Little Liu, the communications squad leader of the Third Battalion, short, with a black and red face. Although he was only eighteen years old, he had already been a party member for three years. We helped him put out the fire on his body while anxiously asking him, "What's wrong? What's wrong?" He gasped and stammered, "Report... report, Battalion Commander Wei... Wei sacrificed... Need... need ammunition!" The regiment commander and I both jumped up.

The communications director put down the receiver and said to us, "The army commander is on the phone himself." After a while, he added, "This morning, he bypassed the division and called directly three times."

From the receiver, I heard the familiar voice of the army commander. I quickly waved to the regiment commander. The two of us, like children, put our heads together and put the receiver between our ears, listening carefully to what the army commander was saying.

The army commander said in the first sentence, "You fought very well! Do you know! Facing you is the enemy's elite troops! But they still ran into a wall!" We asked him to replenish ammunition. He said in a crisp voice, "Send it over immediately!"

"We will definitely hold the position!" The regiment commander shouted into the microphone, and then straightened up and said to the communications director, "You will be the acting battalion commander of the Third Battalion!"

Suddenly, the telephone rang, and the telephone operator shouted, "The Third Battalion! The Third Battalion's phone is connected!"

The regiment commander reached over, grabbed the receiver and asked, "How is it? How is it? Are the casualties high? Can you hold on?"

His face gradually changed from tension to relief, and he answered repeatedly, "Good! Good! Right! ... Pay attention to saving bullets... Seize the opportunity to organize small-scale counter-charges, use bayonets! The enemy is afraid of it, but our soldiers like it!"

The enemy's second attack was quickly repelled by us. The forward positions became quiet, with only shells constantly exploding behind the ridge. The enemy was still trying to control the traffic behind our rear. The army headquarters sent people several times to deliver ammunition, and the division headquarters and fraternal units sent food, but they could not be delivered to the positions. And, unfortunately, the telephone line was broken again, and communication with the Gao Huna position was completely cut off.

We were anxious when we suddenly saw a person rolling down from Gao Huna Mountain. He ran for a while, then lay down for a while, traveling through the artillery fire. When he ran to the command post, we recognized him as Little Liu, the communications squad leader again. He took out a piece of paper and handed it to the regiment commander, saying, "To deliver this letter, three comrades in our squad sacrificed."

This was an ordinary crumpled piece of *guanglian* paper, with several bright red bloodstains on it. Most of the ink was smudged by sweat, but the hastily written handwriting could still be distinguished. The note read:

Regimental Leaders: Our Third Battalion is confident of holding the position. As long as we replenish some ammunition, we won't let the enemy cross Gao Huna even if there is only one person left! First Battalion, you should keep a good hold of things, and don't need to send them over.

Third Battalion

We were all very moved. This is our red soldier, holding onto such a dangerous position, but still thinking about the safety of the overall situation. I saw the regiment commander reading the crooked lines repeatedly, and the fingers holding the piece of paper trembled slightly. I knew he was also deeply moved. After a moment of silence, he asked Little Liu, "How many casualties are there in the Third Battalion?"

"About half," Little Liu replied.

At this time, two people ran into the regimental command post. They turned out to be the reconnaissance section chief and the management section chief from the army headquarters' staff department. The army leaders had heard that several batches of ammunition could not be delivered, and they were very anxious. They sent them to resolutely take advantage of the enemy's midday break in the attack to deliver the ammunition to the positions.

The enemy launched a third attack. Although the troop strength had increased, the formations were even denser, and there were also planes to clear the way for them, and artillery fire to help them, the enemy's prestige had been greatly reduced. The Blue Shirts Society's supervision teams were no longer rushing to the front, but just holding "twenty-shooters" and clamoring in the back of the ranks. The chaotic enemy slowly climbed up the mountain. The shouts of "charge, kill..." sounded like the echo of the sea after a big storm. As soon as our guns fired, a large group of enemies quickly fell down. And our soldiers, each with shining eyes and glowing spirits, some simply jumped to the earthen piles of the fortifications, straddling them as if riding a horse, aiming and shooting as if at a target. Some jumped out of the fortifications, waving their bayonets, and shouted to the enemy, "Come on, come on!" Because the bamboo spike zone was covered with corpses, the charging enemies stepped on their own corpses and approached the front of our fortifications. The soldiers threw grenades, and then suddenly rushed to the enemy, fighting with blood-stained bayonets. Some enemies still parried a few times with their bayonets, while others simply turned around and rolled down the mountain. Except for those who were stabbed to death, the surviving enemies who escaped slowly were dragged into the fortifications by our soldiers. Of course, we also had considerable casualties. Some hastily repaired fortifications were also collapsed again, and our personnel were rapidly decreasing.

At the front of the positions, everywhere was the flash of swords and shadows of blood. The soldiers and I shouted slogans to encourage each other: "Comrades, abide by your sacred promise! Light injuries do not leave the front line, heavy injuries do not shout!" "Defend our Soviet regime! Defend the land!" "Win glory for the Thirteenth Regiment! Avenge the sacrificed comrades!" "The enemy's grave is in front of the position!"

As soon as Comrade Li Guohua, the instructor of the Third Battalion, heard my voice, he turned around in surprise and shouted at me sternly, "Why are you still here? What time is it? Go back to the command post!" While not allowing me to explain, he pushed me away. At this time, the acting battalion commander of the Third Battalion had sacrificed, and the supply director had been replaced. He was personally using a machine gun to sweep the enemy. After finishing a burst of fire, he returned the machine gun to the soldier, turned around and shouted to Little Liu, "Communications squad leader, you send the political commissar down!"

I instructed the Third Battalion Commander a few words, and then crawled out of the fortifications. At this time, my field of vision was wider, smoke was rolling on the positions, and from time to time the figures of soldiers fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy appeared. The sound of gunfire and artillery merged into a huge roar, and the entire Gao Huna was jumping under my feet.

We ran on the hillside that had been plowed loose by the artillery fire. Shells were constantly exploding around us, and the choking smell of gunpowder and the hot smoke rushed straight into our nostrils. My mouth was dry and parched, and I was breathing heavily, but I was still very agile, sometimes lying down, sometimes running. Little Liu followed me closely, step by step, always paying attention to the surroundings, constantly issuing commands to me: "To the left!" "Lie down!" If I was a little slow, he would do it himself. While panting, I said, "Little devil, you're amazing, learning from your instructor?" He ignored me, panting and breathing, and shouted seriously, "Pay attention to stray bullets! Keep your posture low!" Just then, a mortar shell fell almost directly on top of our heads. It was too late to dodge. With one hand, he pushed me down violently, but he went up to meet it. I only saw him kick the shell that had just landed with his foot. Suddenly, there was a flash of golden light, and I lost consciousness.

A pile of mud and stones woke me up. I looked up and saw an enemy yellow plane diving to drop bombs. I could no longer hear the sound of killing on the positions. I jumped up, my whole body was numb and aching, but I tried to move, and there was no clumsiness. Looking around and shouting a few times, I did not hear a reply. Not far from me, there was a shell crater, and there was a pile of blood on the edge of the crater, which had been sucked dry by the sand. I understood what was going on, so I had to walk to the regimental command post myself. My mood was very heavy. On the way, I always felt a young, serious voice ringing in my ears, "Lie down!... Run!"

This bloody battle continued for two hours. Finally, the enemy's most fierce attack was finally repelled by us again. After 4:00 p.m., the enemy stirred up another attack, but that was already a self-consoling attack that had completely lost its sharpness. The purpose was not to occupy our positions, but to try to snatch back some corpses. Although the gunfire was still lively, when the white army soldiers heard the cries of the wounded soldiers abandoned on our front line, some squatted down and dared not move forward; others turned around and ran away, ignoring how our soldiers shouted and waved.

When the sun was still as high as the treetop, the front line finally fell completely silent. Sparse gunshots came from a distance, and the fierce battle on the positions of neighboring units was also coming to an end. The enemy had left a large number of corpses there as well, and retreated in a panic. At dusk, the people waiting at the regimental command post rushed to the Gao Huna and Wangtuzhai positions. There were military and political workers sent by the army headquarters and division headquarters, and stretcher bearers who had been temporarily organized.... The enemy's artillery fire had been blocked for a day, and a large part of the comrades who had sacrificed or been injured on the positions had not been able to be carried down.

The regiment commander ordered the First Battalion to go up the mountain to be responsible for guarding, and the Third Battalion was withdrawn for rest. We stood at the rear foot of Gao Huna Mountain to welcome the soldiers. We looked at the soldiers carefully one by one. What were they wearing? Dragging and hanging, broken beyond recognition; faces stained with dirt, some with their hair and eyebrows burned. Half of them were bandaging wounds on their heads and arms with cloth strips. After a day of fierce fighting, they had not eaten a bite of food or drunk a sip of water. Exhaustion, hunger, and blood loss had made each of them pale and exhausted. I stared blankly at them. I thought of the large team of four or five hundred people when they entered the positions in the morning, but after only one day, there were only a few people left: one company, standing in just one row; one battalion, only needing a soft command to be heard by everyone. In the past few counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns, we had fought many fierce battles, but never so cruelly! We were all very excited, especially when we saw those soldiers who, although extremely tired, were still standing at attention spiritedly; our soldiers were too loyal and too brave.

The last surviving battalion commander walked in front, his sleeves rolled up to his arms, a shell-gun stuck in his waist belt, his face covered with oil and sweat, with a heroic air. He simply reported the battle situation to us.

What else could be said to them, but to gently say, "Everyone has worked hard, thank you. Go eat and rest."

At night, the enemy retreated, and I led the personnel of the direct subordinate units to clean up the battlefield. The moon had just risen from the eastern hillside, and the dark blue light spread like a light mist in the mountains and fields. I patrolled along the battle line that stretched for more than ten *li*. The enemy's corpses were so dense that it was difficult to find a place to step. In the piles of corpses, there were still wounded enemy soldiers crying and wailing, as if hitting hollow dead wood, the sound desolate and empty. The comrades from the supply office brought a few large baskets to collect shoes and other equipment for the soldiers. We saw that each enemy rubber-soled shoe had several small holes pierced by bamboo spikes, and fresh blood flowed from the holes. The stretcher bearers were turning over the piles of corpses, identifying our martyrs. I saw the bodies of Guan Zhonghui, the secretary of the regimental general branch, Wei Zaiji, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion, and many familiar comrades. These martyrs maintained various postures at the time of their sacrifice, some were using their strength to stab forward, some were holding grenades ready to throw, and some were tightly gripping the enemy's necks, their fingers sinking into the flesh. One thing was common: their faces were all facing north, and there were several enemy corpses near them. I looked at them for a long time, imagining the scene of them fighting the enemy. They sacrificed, but their faces and their voices will never disappear from our hearts.

I looked up at the blue night sky. I thought, there will be another fierce battle tomorrow! (Selected from "Liberation Army Thirty Years' Manuscripts", slightly abridged in this newspaper)

    高虎瑙战斗
    中国人民解放军海军上将　苏振华
    广昌一战，国民党用大炮敲开了中央苏区北部的大门，占领了广昌城，继续以重兵，沿广昌石城之线，向我腹地推进。前四次“围剿”的创痛，使敌人拘谨万分。十几万人一踏上红色地区，战战兢兢，好像每一寸土地都喷射着火焰。他们采取了步步为营的堡垒战术，一边前进，一边构筑碉堡，平均每天只能挪动二、三里。那时正是1934年的春天，阴雨连绵，山水横流，敌人的脚步更加滞缓。红军便抓紧这个空隙，在广昌以南、头陂一带，进行了休整。
    那时，我在红三军团五师十三团担任政治委员。这个团是广西百色起义来的红七军的一部分，曾经转战粤桂闽赣各省，参加粉碎敌人四次“围剿”的历次战斗。这个团党员多，老战士多，战斗力很强，曾经在福建，以一个小时的战斗，全歼十九路军的一个主力团，用它的全部捷克式武器，改善了自己的装备。参加广昌会战后，十三团就在头陂南边的半桥镇休整。
    不久，我们接到布防的命令。三军团担负头陂以南、石城以北的广大地区的防守任务。我们五师被配置在五军团和四师之间，十三团担任坚守半桥镇东侧的高虎瑙和王土寨，这是敌人从广昌去石城的必经之地。我们的东面，是四师的防地，半桥镇以西，由五军团的部队负责。为了保卫苏维埃政权、保卫土地、粉碎敌人第五次围剿，我们将在这样广阔的战线上和进犯的敌人搏斗！虽说打阵地防御战还是第一次，但因为过去四次反“围剿”都取得了胜利，大家还是信心百倍，斗志高昂。
    一天，彭德怀军团长亲自来到我们团部，他后边跟着五师师长李天佑同志和师政治委员陈合金同志。他把我和团长黄镇同志喊去，一同看阵地。军团长说：高虎瑙地势险要，是构成整个防御地带的一个重要组成部分，敌人一定会死力争夺。接着，他又详细地指出：阵地应该如何配置，兵力应该如何使用，工事应该如何构筑……。上级首长这样布置，我们都觉得太对了，一句意见也提不出来。军团长立刻警告我们说，“这样不行，你们应该自己考虑更好的作战方案，仗是要你们来打的。”
    接着，开始了紧张的准备工作。那时候，师首长每天都要到前沿来，彭军团长隔不了一两天也要来一趟，检查每一个工事，每一个射击孔。工事在他们严格的要求下，不断地修正着、加固着。部队日夜在讨论，演习；演习，讨论。
    这十几天，确实紧张，确实疲劳，可是我们的工事却构筑坚固了，不仅在高虎瑙阵地、王土寨阵地上，而且在战士们的心上！
    就在结束准备工作的第二天下午，忽然阵地上响起炮弹的爆炸声，工事上的泥土被震得梭梭直掉。我们急忙跑出团指挥所一看，山头上黑烟滚滚，还有许多炮弹在半空爆炸了，绿色的黄色的硝烟，停留在空中，夕阳也变了脸色。“难道今晚就开始吗？”我们互相望了一下。经过很简短的交谈，立刻得出了这样的结论：敌人不敢夜战，这是试炮，真正的攻击在明天。
    “对，明天拂晓！”黄团长肯定地一劈手，立刻喊叫起来：“通讯员，传令各营，后半夜四点钟，进入阵地！”
    天刚拂晓，十多架敌机就带着滚雷似的轰隆声飞来了，敌机丢下的炸弹，像一大群黑老鸦飞堕在阵地上，立刻掀起冲天的烟尘，脚下的土地被震得摇摇晃晃。一批飞走了，又来了一批。接着，对面山上就开始打炮，高虎瑙以及友邻部队的阵地，立即陷在一片烟火的海洋中，暴雨似的炮弹几乎把山头抬起来了，整个大地好像都在一片粗重的爆炸声中崩塌，下沉……。
    敌人攻击前，一定会进行炮击。可是打得这样密集、这样猛烈，却是我们没有预料到的。团长焦急地在工事里走来走去，参谋长卢绍武同志正在不断地轮流和三营、二营通话，喊得脸红脖子粗。我们从敌人的炮声和参谋长的话声中，聚精会神地探测着敌人的动向。忽然，卢参谋长使劲拍打起电话机来，又用嘴吹，用手摇，最后懊丧地把话筒放下，叹口气说：“电话线炸断了！”
    我转身对团长说：“我去二营看看。”
    太阳已经出来了，但是被硝烟遮蔽着，黯然无光。指挥所就在王土寨的后山脚，到二营的阵地，只需要爬二百多米的一段山坡。在烟尘弥漫中，我从一个弹坑跳到另一个弹坑。弹坑里热烘烘的，土块、石头被炸药熏黑了，发出呛人的焦味。我沿着交通沟到各个工事去检查战士们的战斗准备。工事里一片沉寂。战士们紧抓着枪和手榴弹，头上、身上披满了灰土，脸色和灰土一样惨白，一对对眼睛默默地注视着敌方，紧靠工事的土壁，不动，也不说话。工事构筑得坚固，被打坍了的很少。在这点上，可以说，敌人几乎是白费了大量的炮弹。
    就这样，一直打了两个多钟头。忽然，我发觉弹着点逐渐移到第一线工事的后方去了。我正在诧异，营部的旗语兵一头钻进隐蔽部，急促地报告：“团部打来旗语：敌人要进攻了，准备射击！”这时，果然听到对面山下人喊马嘶。二营长梁纪生立刻传下命令：“进入射击位置！”只见战士们站起身，轻松地拍打泥土，从胸怀里拿出武器来。
    通过了望孔，可以观察到敌人的进攻。高虎瑙阵地前面，敌人非常密集，可能有两个师的兵力，显然，敌人是想夺取这个制高点。王土寨前面大约有一个师的兵力。而从东面，从西面，都传来敌人冲锋时的呐喊声。
    我看了看表，敌人是正九点钟开始攻击的。
    敌人很快就进入到我们的射击距离之内，于是，重机枪粗犷的音调突然呼啸起来；不久，许多轻机枪的清脆的嗓子一齐合唱了，迫击炮则用鼓点敲着节拍。——在战场上，我们的枪炮声，比任何动听的音乐，更能激动、振奋人心。我看见战士们都在专心一意地射击着，和刚才挨炮弹时的情景大不相同了。
    我们的短兵火力虽然猛烈，可是还不能完全压制敌人。尽管不少敌人倒下了，但活着的还是一股劲朝上涌，很快就到达了我们鹿砦的跟前。这时候，冲在最前面的蓝衣社队员，突然出现了这样的情况：一个个踮着脚蹦跳起来，一边尖声惨叫，好像站在一块烧红的铁板上。后面的大部队，大概因为眼看快冲到我们阵地了。精神分外抖擞，只顾朝前拥，从倒下的人们身上踩过去，于是一批紧接着一批滚跌下来，嚣张的冲杀声立时变成了凄厉的号叫。好像冲上海滩的浪潮，虽然来势凶猛，却终于扑倒在乱石砂砾之中。
    这时，高虎瑙阵地前面，突然冒起一股股黑烟，接着“篷篷篷”爆炸声像千百面大鼓一齐敲响。我明白了这是怎么回事。二营长也立即派出战士到投弹孔打手榴弹。子弹虽缺，土造手榴弹倒有的是，麻绳尾巴的，掼起来很便当。我们的骄傲的敌人，这时却变成了泥鳅，在外壕前三四十米这一段地带，你挤我轧，乱蹦乱跳，叽哩哇啦，又哭又喊。——想不到军团长指示敷设的“副防御物”，竟发生了这样巨大的作用！现在，我们的手榴弹又帮助这些麕集着的敌人解决了“纠纷”：于是吵闹的沉默了，蹦跳的安静了，各人以各种不同的姿势躺下来了，那些还没有进入竹钉地带的敌人，只好匆匆忙忙滚跌下山去。敌人第一次密集队形的冲锋，只以丢下数不清的尸体而告结束。
    我们工事里却热闹起来，战士们忙碌地到阵地前去抓受伤的俘虏，搜集枪械弹药。我告诉二营长，迅速整理部队，准备对付敌人第二次冲锋，就钻出了工事。这时，才注意到，敌人的炮火打得正紧，炮弹带着尖叫从头顶飞过。一眼望去，在一营集结的地方，浓密的硝烟像黄色的布幕，悬挂在低空，什么也看不见。看样子已经有几百发炮弹落在那里了。我想到，一营作为准备队，没有筑什么坚固的工事，只是挖了些掩体，这一顿炮弹吃得消吗？想到这里，好像踏空了一脚，心猛然往下一沉，急急忙忙往山下奔去。
    我一进指挥所，就听见团长正在对通讯主任喊道：“赶快要一营报告伤亡的确实数字！”他的脸色焦黄，额头上满是汗珠，嘴唇微微有点抖动，一看就知道，情况很严重。
    突然，一个战士几乎是滚进了指挥所，满身烟火。我认识他是三营的通讯班长小刘，矮矮的，脸孔黑里透红，虽然才十八岁，却已经有了三年党龄了。我们一边帮他扑灭身上的火，一边焦急地问他：“怎么了？怎么了？”他喘着气口吃地嚷道：“报……报告，韦……韦营长牺牲。……要……要弹药！”我和团长都跳了起来。
    通讯主任放下听筒，对我们说：“军团长亲自来电话。”一会又补充道：“上午，他越过师，直接来了三次电话。”
    从听筒里，我听到了熟悉的军团长的声音，我连忙朝团长招招手。我们两个人像小孩子似地，头和头靠在一起，把听筒放在两人耳朵之间，仔细地听着军团长说话。
    军团长第一句就说：“你们打得很好！知道吗！在你们面前，是敌人的精锐部队！可是，他们照样碰了壁！”我们请求他补充弹药。他用爽脆的声调说：“马上派人送来！”
    “我们一定守住阵地！”团长对话筒里喊了一声，直起身就对通讯主任说：“你去代理三营营长！”
    忽然，电话铃响了，电话员喊叫起来：“三营的！三营的电话接通了！”
    团长摸过去，抓住听筒就问，“怎么样？怎么样？伤亡大吗？能坚持吗？”
    他的脸色，由紧张而逐渐和缓，一连声回答着：“好！好！对！……注意节约子弹……抓住时机，组织小部队的反冲锋，用刺刀！敌人害怕它，我们的战士却喜欢它！”
    敌人的第二次攻击很快被我们击退了。前沿阵地沉寂下来，只有炮弹不断地在山梁后爆炸，敌人还死力地控制着我后方的交通。军团部几次派人送来弹药，师部和兄弟部队送来了饭菜，可是，都无法送上阵地；而且，不幸的是电话线又断了，和高虎瑙阵地的联络，竟至完全断绝。
    我们正在焦急，忽然看见从高虎瑙山上滚下来一个人，他一会儿飞跑，一会儿卧倒，穿行在炮火中间，等他跑到指挥所，我们才认出又是那个通讯班长小刘。他掏出一张纸，递给团长，一边说：“为了送这封信，我们班里牺牲了三个同志。”
    这是一张普通的被揉皱了的光连纸，上面有几块鲜红的血迹，墨水大部分被汗水漶化了，但还可以辨认出那些匆忙写出来的笔迹。纸条上这样写着：
    团首长：我们三营有信心守阵地，只要补充些弹药，那怕剩下一个人，也不让敌人跨过高虎瑙一步！一营，你们好好掌握，可以不要派来。
                  三营
    我们都很感动。这就是我们的红色战士，据守在这样危险的阵地上，考虑着的却还是全局的安危。我看见团长反复地读着那几行歪斜的字，捏着纸片的手指微微有点抖动。我知道他也是被深深地感动了。沉默了一会，他问小刘：“三营伤亡多少？”
    “大概有一半。”小刘回答。
    这时候，有两个人跑进团指挥所来，原来是军团参谋处的侦察科长和管理科长。军团首长听说好几批弹药送不上去，很是焦急，派他们来坚决要利用中午敌人停止攻击的空隙，将弹药送上阵地。
    敌人又发动了第三次攻击。虽然兵力是增加了，队形更加密集，而且也还有飞机替他们开道，炮火替他们助威，可是敌人的声威已经大大减弱了，蓝衣社的督战队，再不是冲在前面，而只是举着“二十响”在队伍后边乱喳呼了。乱糟糟的敌人缓慢地向山上爬着，“冲呀，杀呀……”的嚷叫声，好像大风暴过去后海上的回音。只要我们枪一响，就有一大片敌人连忙伏倒下去。而我们的战士呢，一个个目光闪闪，神采焕发，有的干脆跳到工事的土堆上，骑马似地跨坐着，像打靶那样瞄准打。有的跳出工事，晃着刺刀，向敌人招手喊叫：“你们来呀，来呀！”竹钉地带因为被尸体铺满了，冲锋的敌人踏着自己人的尸体，接近到我们工事前沿来。战士们打出手榴弹，然后就突然冲到敌人面前，用染血的刺刀拼杀。敌人有的还摆着枪刺招架几下，有的干脆转身就向山下滚去。除了被刺死的以外，活着的敌人逃得慢一步，就被我们的战士连拖带拽地拉进工事里来。当然，我们也有不小的伤亡，有些匆促修补的工事，又被打坍了，我们的人员在迅速减少。
    阵地前沿，满目是刀光血影。我和战士们一齐喊着鼓动的口号：“同志们，遵守自己神圣的诺言！轻伤不下火线，重伤不喊叫！”“保卫我们的苏维埃政权！保卫土地！”“为十三团争光！为牺牲的同志报仇！”“阵地前就是敌人的坟墓！”
    三营教导员李国华同志一听到我的声音，吃惊地回过头来，声色俱厉地朝我嚷道：“你怎么还在这里？这是什么时候，快回到指挥所去吧！”一边不容我分说，推着我就走。这时，代理三营长的通讯主任已经牺牲，又换成供给主任了。他正在亲手用一挺机枪扫射敌人，打完一梭子，这才把机枪交还给战士，回转身对小刘叫道：“通讯班长，你送政委下去！”
    我嘱咐了三营长几句，便钻出了工事。这时，我的视界更广阔了，阵地上浓烟滚滚，不时现出战士们和敌人肉搏的身影。枪炮声混成一片巨响，整个高虎瑙在脚下跳动。
    我们在被炮火犁松了的山坡上奔跑着。炮弹不断在四周爆炸，呛人的火药味和热扑扑的烟尘，直冲进鼻孔。我口干舌燥，喘得厉害，可还是灵活得很，时而卧倒，时而飞跑。小刘紧跟着我，一步也不拉，随时注意着四周，不断向我发出口令：“向左！”“卧倒！”慢一些，他就动手。我一边喘，一边说：“小鬼，好厉害，学你们教导员的吧？”他不理我，呼哧呼哧喘气，严肃地喊着：“注意流弹！姿势放低！”正在这时候，一颗迫击炮弹几乎正对着我们的头顶落下来，躲让已经来不及了。他一手把我猛然推倒，自己却迎上去。我只看见他飞起脚，使劲朝那颗刚着地的炮弹踢去忽然金光一闪，我就失掉了知觉。
    一大堆泥块和石头的雹点把我砸醒。我抬起头看看，一只敌人的黄色飞机正在俯冲投弹，阵地上已经听不到喊杀声了。我跳起身，浑身发麻疼痛，但试着活动了一下，并没有不灵便处。四处看看，又喊了几声，听不到回答。在离我不远的地方，有一个弹坑，坑边有一堆血，已经被沙土吸干。我明白了这是怎么回事，只好自己朝团指挥所走去。我心情很沉重，一路上，总觉得有个年青的严肃的声音在耳边响着“卧倒！……快跑！……”
    这一场血战，一直连续了两个小时，最后，敌人最猛烈的一次攻击，终于又被我们击退。下午四点多钟，敌人又鼓噪着进攻了一次，可是，那已经是完全失掉了锐气的一种自慰式的攻击，目的也不在于占领我军阵地，而是想抢回去一些死尸。尽管枪炮还打得热闹，白军士兵们一听到被遗弃在我前沿的伤兵的惨叫声，有的就蹲伏下来，不敢前进了；有的转身就跑，不管我们的战士怎样喊叫和招手，他们也不理睬了。
    太阳还有树头高的时候，战线终于完全沉寂下来。远处传来稀稀落落的炮声，友邻部队阵地上的激烈战斗，也接近尾声了。敌人在那里同样地留下了大批死尸，狼狈地撤退了。黄昏，等待在团指挥所的人们，一齐朝高虎瑙、王土寨阵地上奔去，这里有军团部、师部派来的军政工作人员，有临时组织的担架队员……。敌人炮火封锁了一天，阵地上牺牲或负伤的同志，还有一大部分没有能抬下来。
    团长命令一营上山去负责警戒，三营撤下来休息。我们站在高虎瑙后山麓迎接战士们。我们挨个地把战士们仔细看了一遍。他们穿的还算什么衣服呀，拖拖挂挂的，破得不像样子；脸上污垢斑驳，有的人头发和眉毛都烧焦了，有一半人用布片包扎着头部、手臂上的伤口。一天激烈的战斗，没有吃上一口饭，喝上一口水，疲累，饥饿，加上流血，一个个都变得苍白而疲累。我呆呆看着他们。我想到早晨进入阵地时，是四五百人的大队伍，仅仅一天，却只剩下了这么几个人：一个连队，只站一行；一个营，只要轻声喊口令，就全都听到了。过去几次反“围剿”，打了许多次恶战，从来也没有这样残酷！我们都很激动，尤其是看到那些虽然过度疲劳了，却还神气地立正站着的战士们；我们的战士是太忠实太勇敢了。
    最后一个生还的营长走在最前面，袖管捞到臂腕上，腰皮带上插一支卜壳枪，满脸油汗，有一股豪壮之气。他向我们简单地报告了战斗情况。
    对他们，还有什么好说的呢，只是轻轻说：“大家辛苦了，感谢你们。快去吃饭，休息。”
    晚上，敌人后撤了，我带领直属队的人员去打扫战场。月亮刚从东边山头上升起来，幽蓝的光像轻雾一样，在山野间弥漫。我沿着绵延十几里的战线巡视。敌人的尸体这样密，甚至难于插脚。在尸堆里还有敌人的伤兵在哭泣，呼号，好像撞击着一根根空洞的枯木，声音凄凉而空漠。供给处的同志带来几个大箩筐，为战士们收集鞋子和其他装具。我们看到，每一只敌人的胶底鞋，都有几个被竹钉戳穿的小洞，鲜血从洞里流了出来。担架员在尸堆里翻认着我们的烈士。我看到了团总支书记管中会、三营营长韦在纪，以及许多熟识的同志们的尸体。这些烈士保持着牺牲时的各种姿态，有的正在用劲向前刺杀，有的抱着手榴弹准备投掷，有的紧紧攫住敌人的脖子，手指一直陷进了肉里。有一点是共同的：他们的脸都是朝向北方，他们附近都有好几具敌人的尸体。我久久地看着他们，想像着他们和敌人搏斗时的情景。他们牺牲了，可是他们的容貌，他们的声音，却永远不会在我们心中消失。
    我仰望苍蓝的夜空。我想，明天还将有一场恶战！（选自“解放军三十年征文”，本报有所删节）
