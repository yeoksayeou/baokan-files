Following Chairman Mao on the Long March
Chen Changfeng

One night in April 1935, the Red First Front Army and central organs, composed of the Ninth Army, the First Army, the Fifth Army, the Third Army, and the cadre regiment, reached the Jinsha River. This was the first large river we encountered after breaking through the Wujiang River. The Jinsha River was turbulent, with fierce waves churning like a vicious dragon. We had very few boats, and everyone was anxious. Chairman Mao was even busier, discussing with the responsible comrades of each army group how to cross the river.

At that time, I was Chairman Mao's guard. As dawn approached, Chairman Mao took me on a boat across the Jinsha River. As soon as he got off the boat, he discussed with General Liu Bocheng, the then Chief of General Staff, how to advance after the troops crossed the river. I went to find him a house to arrange accommodation.

The riverbank was a bare rocky mountain with no houses, only four or five dilapidated caves. The caves were very damp, with no wooden boards and no straw to be found. I had to lay a piece of oilcloth on the damp ground and put a blanket on it as a bed for Chairman Mao. I thought, let him come back and rest for a while. Others may not know, but I knew that he had been too tired these past few days.

After setting up the bed, his documents, maps, and other office supplies had not yet been unpacked. In the past, whenever we reached a campsite, these things would be taken out by me and Secretary Huang Youfeng and placed on a makeshift desk. But today, there was no desk, and Secretary Huang Youfeng had not yet crossed the river. How could he work? I took out the map to hang it on the wall, but the cave was made of sandy soil, and it was impossible to hang it up. There was no table, and the office supplies could not be arranged. By this time, it had been two meals since the crossing had started. Chairman Mao might be back soon from General Liu’s place. I hadn’t even boiled the water yet! He had been tired all night, how could he not even have a sip of water when he came back! I ignored the office supplies and went to find a place to boil water.

It was broad daylight when Chairman Mao returned and asked someone to call me. When I entered the cave, I saw him standing in the middle of the cave, deep in thought. I said, "You're back." He responded, and then asked me, "Is everything ready?" I pointed to the bed on the ground and said, "It's ready! There aren't even wooden boards here, so the bed has to be made on the ground. Please rest for a while, the water will be boiling soon." After speaking, I wanted to rush out to continue boiling water. Before I could leave the cave, he stopped me: "Where is the place to work?" I replied casually: "Secretary Huang hasn't arrived yet, and we can't even find a small table here. You, you should drink some water first!" He seemed not to have heard my words, took a step forward, and said in his serious but gentle tone: "The most important thing now is work, eating and drinking are minor matters. There are two or three thousand comrades waiting for us on the other side of the river! This is the lives of tens of thousands of comrades!" I just stood there blankly in front of him, my heart pounding, unable to say a word. Chairman Mao took a few steps forward, patted my shoulder and said, "Find a wooden board to prop it up first!" Only then did I suddenly realize and ran out of the cave like a shot.

I finally found a small wooden board blocking the cave entrance and quickly carried it into Chairman Mao's office cave. Chairman Mao personally helped me prop it up and put on the office supplies. At this time, I suddenly thought that the water I was boiling must be boiling, so I wanted to go out and get it. Just as I was about to step out, I heard Chairman Mao call out, "Chen Changfeng!" I said, "Yes!" "Come here." I walked over and stood opposite the newly erected "table". Chairman Mao said, "I'm going to punish you today!" Although his voice was still so gentle and his eyes were still so loving, my heart suddenly became tense. This tension was a self-reproach caused by dereliction of duty. I didn't know what to do, just rubbing the corners of my clothes with both hands, staring blankly at Chairman Mao. He continued, "I'm fining you one day of no sleep, sitting here and working with me." I laughed foolishly and said, "Okay!" and sat down opposite him. At this time, his office "table" was full of documents, telegrams, and the telephone rang constantly. I saw that he was so busy that he had no free time at all, and I felt very sad, even wanting to cry. I thought if I had found this wooden board earlier, maybe he wouldn't be so busy.

I have a habit of loving to sleep. Usually, when Chairman Mao was working, I always liked to sit aside and doze off. I also knew that Chairman Mao's saying that he was fining me for not sleeping was a joke; but today, seeing Chairman Mao working with a hundred times more energy, I had no sleepiness at all. I noticed that Chairman Mao was looking at me from time to time and smiling slightly. I didn't know what to do. Later, I went out to fetch boiling water and cooled a cup for him before sitting down again. After two meals, Chairman Mao stood up and said to me: "You have been with me for so many years, don't you know the importance of work. From now on, every time you go to a place, the most important thing is to prepare the place for work, and then, if there is time, eat and rest. Remember, whether now or in the future, the most important thing for us is work." He paused, walked closer to me, stroked my head with his hand and said softly: "Okay, go to sleep quickly, your eyelids are fighting." Hearing these words, I was even more unwilling to move. Chairman Mao said again: "Go to sleep quickly!" The tears that were originally in my eyes all flowed out at once. But I knew that these tears were not because I had been criticized by Chairman Mao. At that time, I only felt like I had done something wrong at home, and my parents didn't blame me, but instead said: "Okay, don't do it next time, go play!" My heart was churning, not knowing whether it was happiness or sadness.

I lay on the bunk not far from Chairman Mao, and couldn't fall asleep for a long time. The scenes of my life with Chairman Mao over the years flashed through my mind.

...It was at the end of March 1930, I was transferred from the headquarters of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the Chinese Revolutionary Front Committee to be Chairman Mao's orderly. At that time, we did not call him Chairman, but only called him Comrade Mao.

Chairman Mao's luggage was very simple, only two and a half woolen blankets, a piece of foreign cloth sheet, two sets of gray military uniforms like our soldiers, and a silver-gray sweater. The things he used were a patched umbrella, a jar for eating, and a gray nine-pocket briefcase. Chairman Mao's maps, documents, and books filled this briefcase. Whenever marching and fighting, he carried the briefcase and the umbrella, and I carried the rest of the things. When we arrived at the campsite, we found two pieces of wood and put them together, spread out the only two blankets and a small sheet, and made a pillow out of clothes. This was his bed.

Chairman Mao rarely slept at night. After dinner, he would light a small lamp, open the nine-pocket briefcase, take out maps, documents, paper, and pens, and start working. Chairman Mao was reading and writing, and I would sit beside him. I was young at that time and couldn't stay up late, so I would fall asleep next to him before long. Around midnight, he would gently wake me up and say: "Get some water!" Only then would I wake up and carry a small wooden bucket of Jiangxi to fetch a bucket of cold water. Because there was no washbasin, he would dip a towel in the bucket to wipe his face, and sometimes wipe his body to refresh himself. Often after wiping his face, he would be hungry. I would heat up a jar of "three-layer rice" that was left over from the afternoon—the bottom layer was rice, the middle layer was a little bit of vegetables, and the top layer was rice again—for him to eat. Sometimes he couldn't finish this jar of rice, so he would cover it with paper and save it for the next meal. He never allowed me to throw it away casually. After eating, he would continue reading or writing. The famous "Land Investigation Movement" was written under such circumstances.

The Central Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government was established in Ruijin. He was elected Chairman of the Republic. But at that time, he still only used a jar to eat. It was not until February 1934, when we captured Zhangzhou in Fujian, that we got a three-layer enameled lunch box.

I am a child from a poor family. I couldn't afford to go to school at home. When I joined the revolution, I didn't know a single character. At that time, the Red Army had to put up slogans everywhere, and Chairman Mao used the breaks in the march to teach me to read by pointing to the slogans. My name was also taught to me by Chairman Mao himself.

The ringing of the telephone pulled me back from my memories. I looked up and saw that Chairman Mao was still working.

The thirty or forty thousand troops on the other side of the Jinsha River continued to cross for three days and three nights. Chairman Mao also did not leave that office "table" for three days and three nights.

After crossing the Jinsha River and passing through the Yi ethnic area, the iron torrent of the Red Army rapidly crossed the Dadu River in May 1935 and arrived at Hualingping. This day we were to depart from Hualingping to Shuizidi. It was said that it would take a day to reach.

In the morning, we departed from Hualingping. Chairman Mao had something to do and didn't catch up with the central team, so he advanced with the health department's team. Accompanying Chairman Mao this time were me and Hu Changbao, the leader of our guard squad. Our group walked to a mountain section of more than ten miles up and down. Three enemy planes rushed towards us crazily, and several bombs they dropped landed right beside us. Everyone gathered around Chairman Mao anxiously, afraid that he might be in danger. I stood up and saw Chairman Mao squatting beside a comrade who had just been injured. I went over and saw that the injured person was our squad leader, Comrade Hu Changbao. He was lying on the ground, tightly holding his stomach with both hands, without making a sound. Chairman Mao was very close to him, stroking his head with one hand while saying to the health worker Comrade Zhong Fuchang: "Quick, give him some medicine." Comrade Hu Changbao waved his hand to Chairman Mao and said: "Chairman, I can't do it anymore, you continue to advance!" He spoke with great difficulty, as if something was blocking his throat. His originally rosy face had turned as yellow as paper. Chairman Mao sat beside him, letting Hu Changbao's head rest on his arm, and said softly: "Comrade Hu Changbao, you'll be alright, hold on, we'll carry you to Shuizidi and have the doctor treat you, and you'll get better." Hu Changbao's head moved in Chairman Mao's arms, and he anxiously said to Chairman Mao: "Chairman, I can't let you carry me, I can't do it anymore, all the blood is flowing into my stomach. I have nothing to worry about. After I sacrifice, if possible, please tell my parents, they live in Ji'an, Jiangxi. It's just a pity that I can't follow you to northern Shaanxi to see our base area." After speaking, he turned his face to me and said: "Comrade Chen Changfeng, you must protect Chairman Mao and the central leaders well." His voice became smaller and smaller, and the last few words were even unclear. I could only see his lips trembling slightly. Finally, he used his greatest strength to raise his head and said to Chairman Mao and me: "Wish the revolution victory!" and closed his eyes. I shouted: "Squad leader! Squad leader!" But he could no longer respond. Chairman Mao slowly took his hand from under his neck and stood up slowly. He said to me: "Quilt!" I handed him a quilt that was hanging on my body. Chairman Mao opened the quilt and personally covered Comrade Hu Changbao.

One evening in mid-September, the Long March team arrived at a village very close to Lazikou. I prepared a bed for Chairman Mao and prepared to ask him to rest for a while. But when I looked into another room, the table was covered with maps. He was talking with leaders such as Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, Liu Yalou, and Luo Ruiqing. I didn't say a word and walked out.

At dawn the next day, we captured Lazikou and continued to advance. It was said that we would cross the Liupan Mountain today and travel more than a hundred miles to reach a village called Hadabao.

When we set off, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and a strong wind was blowing in gusts. Before long, it also started to rain. When we arrived at the foot of Liupan Mountain, Chairman Mao and I were soaked.

Compared with the snowy mountains we had passed before, Liupan Mountain, although not the largest, was also sixty miles up and down. When we first went up the mountain, there were still some trees to hold on to, but when we were about to reach the top of the mountain, there were no more trees, only some small grasses that were about to wither. It became even more difficult to walk.

I have had malaria since passing through Jiajin Mountain. A few days ago in Sichuan, I don't know why my leg suddenly swelled up. Although the swelling has subsided these past two days, my body is still very weak. When I was about to reach the top of Liupan Mountain, I only felt dizzy and could not move a step. Chairman Mao saw me like this and asked me how I was. I said: "Chairman, I'm afraid I can't cross this mountain." As I said that, I fell to the ground. Chairman Mao helped me up, thinking that I had malaria again, so he asked the guard Comrade Zeng Xianji to find the health worker Comrade Zhong Fuchang to get medicine for me. In fact, I didn't have malaria, but the long march had made my body completely exhausted. I said: "Chairman, go ahead, I'll go after resting for a while." Seeing me like this, Chairman Mao said: "Chen Changfeng, the air here is thin and it's raining, you can't rest here. You must persevere and cross this mountain." As he spoke, he was about to carry me with Comrade Zeng Guangji. Seeing Chairman Mao caring about me so much, I also wanted to walk quickly. Who knew that my whole body was trembling non-stop and I couldn't take a step. Chairman Mao asked again: "Are you cold?" I said: "Cold, my whole body is contracting, and my bones are cold." Chairman Mao looked at me and said: "Here, put on my leather coat, and drink some hot water, you'll feel better." As he spoke, he took off his coat. I grabbed Chairman Mao's hand and said: "No, I won't wear it, I can walk." I knew that after Chairman Mao took off his coat, he only had a gray cotton-padded pants and a gray military uniform top that he had made in Zunyi. Moreover, he had been busy until very late last night and had not slept. I insisted on not wearing it and struggled to walk. But because my body was too weak, I fainted again as soon as I took a step. When I woke up and opened my eyes, Comrade Zeng Guangji was holding a bowl of water in front of me. I had already put on Chairman Mao's leather coat, and Chairman Mao was standing in front of me. The autumn wind blew his thin gray military uniform. A strange force made me stand up suddenly, staring blankly at him. His loving eyes seemed even more kind. Chairman Mao said to me: "Are you better?" I said: "I'm better! Let's go!" Chairman Mao said: "Good job! This is the soldier of the Red Army! Let's go!"

In the evening, we walked down Liupan Mountain. Before we reached Hadabao, we lived in a village with Han people. I lay on the bed and thought: If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leather coat, I would have sacrificed on Liupan Mountain today. Thinking about it, tears welled up in my eyes again. Zhao Ao recorded.

    跟随毛主席长征
    陈昌奉
    1935年4月的一个夜晚，由九军团、一军团、五军团、三军团和干部团组成的红一方面军和中央机关到达了金沙江边，这是我们突破乌江后遇上的第一条大江。金沙江，水急浪大，凶龙般的翻腾着。我们船只很少，大家都很着急。毛主席更是忙碌，他在和各军团的负责同志研究如何渡江。
    那时，我当毛主席的警卫员。天快拂晓，主席带我登上船渡过了金沙江。一下船，他又和当时的总参谋长刘伯承将军，研究队伍渡江后如何前进的问题去了。我去给他找房子，安排住处。
    江岸边是光秃秃的石山，没有什么房屋，只有四、五个不像样的洞子。洞子里湿的很，没有木板，就连稻草也找不到。我只好在潮湿的地下铺上一块油布，放上毯子算是给主席打好了铺。心想，等他回来休息一下。别人不知道，我是知道的：他这几天太累了。
    搭好了铺，他的文件、地图等办公用具都还没有打开。过去一到宿营地，这些东西都是我和秘书黄有风同志一块拿出来，摆在临时搭起的办公桌上的。可今天一来没有办公桌，二来黄有风同志还没有过江，怎么办公呢？我拿出地图往墙上挂去，这洞子是沙土的，根本挂不上。没有桌子，办公用具也摆不开。这时，过江已有吃两顿饭的工夫，主席也许快从刘总参谋长那里回来了，我连水还没有烧好呢！他累了一夜，回来一口水也喝不上那怎么能行呢！我就没管办公用品摆没有摆开，去找地方烧水去了。
    天大亮了，主席回来了，找人来叫我。我一进洞口看见他站在洞子中间沉思。我说：“您回来了。”他答应了一声，接着问我道：“都弄好了吧！”我指着地下的铺说：“好了！这地方连木板也没有，铺只好打在这地下了。请您先休息一会，水马上就开了。”说完，我拔腿就想出去继续烧水。还没有走出洞口，他就把我叫住了：“办公的地方呢？”我随口答道：“黄秘书还没来到，这里连张小桌子也找不到。您，您先喝点水吧！”他像是没有听见我的话，向前迈了一步用他那严肃的，但又是温和的语调说：“现在重要的是工作，吃饭喝水都是小事。江那边有我们两三万同志在等着哪！这是几万同志的性命呀！”我只是呆呆的站在他的面前，心里怦怦直跳，竟一句话也说不出来。主席又向前走了几步，用手拍着我的肩膀说：“先去找块木板架起来也行！”我这才恍然大悟，飞也似的跑出了洞子。
    好容易找到了一块堵洞口的小木板，连忙搬进了主席办公的洞子。主席亲自动手和我把它架了起来，摆上了办公用具。这时，我突然想到烧的水一定开了，便想出去取来。我刚想迈步，就听见主席叫道：“陈昌奉！”我说：“有！”“你过来。”我走过去，站在刚架起来的“桌子”对面。主席说：“我今天要处分你呢！”虽然他的声音还是那样的温和，他的双目还是那样的慈爱，但我的心里却顿时紧张起来。这种紧张，是因失职而造成的自疚。我不知该怎么办，只是双手揉搓着衣角，呆呆的望着主席。他接着说：“我罚你一天不睡觉，坐在这里和我一起工作。”我听了傻笑了一声说：“好吧！”就在他对面坐下来。这时，他的办公“桌”上摆满了文件，电报，电话铃也不断地响起来。我看他忙的一点空也没有，心里很难过，竟想流出泪来。心想如果我早一点找到这块木板，也许不致使他忙得这样。
    我有个爱睡觉的老毛病，平时主席工作的时候，我总好坐在一旁打盹，我也知道主席说罚我不睡觉，是一句笑话；但今天一看主席他精神百倍的工作，却一点睡意也没有了，我发现主席不时的用眼瞅我，并微微发笑。我更不知如何才好。后来我出去打来开水，给他凉了一杯，才又坐下来。过了有两顿饭的工夫，主席站起来对我说：“你跟我这么多年了，难道还不知道工作的重要。以后每到一个地方，最重要的是把办公的地方搞好，然后如果有空才是吃饭、休息，记住，无论现在和将来，对我们来说最重要的是工作。”他停了一下，走近我，用手抚摸着我的头轻轻地说：“好了，快去睡觉吧，两个眼皮都打仗了。”听了这话，我更不愿动了。主席又说：“快睡去吧！”我原来存在眼内的泪水，一下子全流了出来。但我知道这泪并不是因为我受了主席的批评才流出来的。当时只觉得像在家里作错了事，父母不责难我，反而说：“好了，下次不可，去玩去吧！”一样，心里翻腾的厉害，不知是高兴，还是难过。
    我躺在离主席不远的地铺上，很久没有睡着，跟毛主席几年来的生活一幕幕在我脑海中闪过。
    ……那是1930年3月底，我由工农红军第四军军部，调到中国革命前敌委员会，给毛主席当勤务员。那时我们还不称他为主席，只是称他毛委员。
    主席的行装很简单，只有两床半毛半线的毯子，一条洋布被单，两套和我们战士一样的灰军服，一件银灰色的毛衣。用的东西是一把已经缝过了的破雨伞，一个吃饭用的缸子，和一个灰色的九个口袋的公文包。主席用的地图、文件、书籍把这个公文包装的满满的。每当行军作战，他背着公文包拿着雨伞，我就背着其余的东西。到了宿营地，找两块木板对起来，铺上那仅有的两床毯子和小被单，用衣服打成枕头，这便是他的卧铺。
    主席晚上很少睡觉。吃过晚饭就点上小灯，打开那个九个口袋的公文包，拿出地图、文件、纸、笔就开始工作。主席在看书、写字，我就在旁边坐着。我那时年龄小，不能熬夜，不一会便伏在他身边睡去。每到半夜时分他就轻轻地把我叫醒，说：“搞点水来吧！”我这才醒来，提着江西那种小木桶去打一桶凉水，打来了水因为没有脸盆，他便用毛巾在桶里沾着擦擦脸，有时擦擦澡提提精神。往往擦过了脸他就饿了。我便把下午留下来的一缸子“三层饭”——最底下一层是米饭，中间是一点菜，顶上面一层又是米饭——去热一热给他吃。有时这一缸子饭吃不了，就用纸盖起来，留着下顿再吃。从来不准我随便倒掉。吃了饭，他又看下去或写下去，有名的“查田运动”就是在这样的情况下写成的。
    中央工农民主政府在瑞金成立了。他当选了共和国主席。但他那时吃饭还是只用一个缸子。直到1934年2月，我们打开了福建的漳州，才搞到一个三层的搪磁饭盒。
    我是个穷人家的孩子，在家念不起书，参加革命时一个字也不识，那时红军每到一处都要贴标语，主席就利用行军的空隙指着标语教我认字。我的名字还是主席亲手教给我写的。
    电话的铃声，把我从回忆中拉了回来，抬头一看，主席还在工作着。
    金沙江对岸的三四万部队，一直过了三天三夜。主席也三天三夜没有离开那张办公“桌”。
    渡过金沙江，通过了彝族区，红军的铁流在1935年5月急行抢渡了大渡河，到达了花岭坪。这天我们要从花岭坪出发去水子地。据说要走一天才能达到。
    早上从花岭坪出发，主席有事没赶上中央队的队伍，就和卫生部的队伍一块前进了。这次跟着主席的有我，还有我们警卫班的班长胡长保。我们一行走到了一个上下十多里的山间，三架敌机疯狂的向我们冲来，扔下来的几颗炸弹正落在我们身旁。大家一齐望主席身边拥去，心里紧张的很，只怕他出了什么危险。我站起来一看，主席蹲在一个刚才负伤的同志身旁。我过去一看，负伤的原来是我们的班长胡长保同志。他躺在地上，双手紧紧的抚着肚子，一声也不响。主席靠他很近，一边用手抚摸着他的头，一边对卫生员锺福昌同志说：“快，给他上点药。”胡长保同志向主席摆了摆手说：“主席，我不行了，你们继续前进吧！”他说话非常吃力，像有什么东西堵住了他的喉咙。他原来那张红润的脸，竟变得像黄纸一样。主席坐在他的身边，让胡长保的头枕在他的臂上，轻轻地说：“胡长保同志，你不要紧，坚持一下，我们把你抬到水子地，找医生治疗一下就会好了的。”胡长保的头在主席的怀里转动了一下，着急地对主席说：“主席，我不能让您抬着我走，我不行了，血全流在肚子里了。我没有什么牵挂的，我牺牲了之后，如果有可能请您转告我的父母，他们住在江西吉安。只可惜我不能跟您到陕北，看一看我们的根据地。”说罢又转过脸来对我说：“陈昌奉同志，你要好好的保护主席和中央首长。”他说话的声音越来越小，最后几个字竟至听不清楚，只看见他嘴唇微微颤动。最后他用了最大的力气抬起头来，对主席和我说：“祝革命胜利！”便合上了双眼。我喊着：“班长！班长！”但他已经再也不能答应了。主席慢慢地从他的脖子底下抽出手，缓慢地站起来。对我说：“夹被！”我顺手将挂在身上的一床夹被递给了他。主席将夹被打开，亲手盖在了胡长保同志的身上。
    9月中旬的一个傍晚，长征队伍到达了离腊子口很近的一个村庄。我给主席搭好了铺，准备请他来休息一下。但到另一个屋里一看，桌上布满了地图。他正和林彪、聂荣臻、刘亚楼、罗瑞卿等首长在谈话。我没吭声就走了出来。
    第二天拂晓，我们打下了腊子口，继续前进。听说今天要翻过六盘山，走一百多里地才能赶到一个名叫哈达堡的村子。
    出发时，天上布满了黑云，疾风一阵阵地吹着，不一会雨也忽啦啦的下起来。当我们来到六盘山下，主席和我的身上都被淋湿了。
    六盘山和我们以前走过的雪山相比，虽然不是最大的，但一上一下也有六十里地。刚上山还有点树扶着，快到山顶时树没有了，只有一些快要枯死的小草。行走起来更加艰难。
    从过了夹金山我就发疟疾。前几天在四川时，不知怎么腿又忽然肿了起来，这两天虽然消了肿，但身体还很虚弱，当我快要到达六盘山顶的时候，只觉得头昏眼花，一步也挪不动了。主席见我这样；就问我怎么样。我说：“主席，这座山恐怕我过不去了。”说着我便一头栽到在地上。主席把我扶起来，以为我又犯了疟疾，便叫警卫员曾先基同志把卫生员锺福昌同志找来拿药给我吃。其实我并不是犯了疟疾，只是长时间的行军把身体搞的一点力气都没有了。我说：“主席先走吧，我休息一会就走”。主席见我这样，便说：“陈昌奉，这里空气稀薄，又在下雨，你不能在这里休息。无论如何要坚持住翻过这个山。”说着便要和曾光基同志架着我走。我见主席对我这样关心，也想快走，谁知浑身战抖个不停，一步也迈不开。主席又问我说：“你是不是冷呀？”我说：“冷，全身收缩，骨头缝里发凉。”主席看了看我说：“来，你把我的皮大衣穿上，再喝上一点热水，暖和暖和就会好了。”说着就脱大衣，我一把抓住了主席的手说：“不，我不穿，我能走。”我知道主席脱下了大衣，他身上就只剩下在遵义时所做的一条灰夹裤，和一个灰军装上衣了，而且昨天晚上他还忙到很晚没有睡觉。我坚持不穿，挣扎着想走。但终因我身体太弱，刚一迈步又昏倒在地上。当我醒来睁眼一看，曾光基同志端着一碗水在我面前。我身上已经穿上了主席的皮大衣，主席站在我前面，秋风吹动了他那单薄的灰色军装。一股奇异的力量使我忽的一下站了起来，呆呆的望着他，他那慈爱的双眼显得更加可亲。主席对我说：“好些了吗？”我说：“好了！走吧！”主席说：“好样的！这才是红军的战士！走！”
    傍晚的时候，我们走下了六盘山。还没有到哈达堡，就住在一个有汉人的村子里。我躺在铺上想：如果没有主席这个皮大衣，我今天一定牺牲在六盘山上了。想着想着泪水又涌出了眼眶。　赵　驁　笔录  （选自“解放军三十年”征文）（附图片）
    当我醒来睁眼一看，……我身上已经穿上了主席的皮大衣，主席站在我前面，秋风吹动了他那单薄的灰色军装。  李琦插图
