    Love
    ——Notes of a Laborer, Part Three
    Wang Ming
    In front of our gate, there is a fruit stand, and some time ago, it also sold newly available peonies. Every evening, I always liked to linger near this fruit stand. It was usually around this time that the fruit stand was managed by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen wearing a red scarf. She liked to sing and listen to stories, and as soon as she saw me, she would ask me to tell her a story. In this way, I became good friends with this young girl.
    She told me that around six o'clock every day, there would be a regular customer who came to buy fruit. This customer had been like this every day for several months. It seemed that the young girl liked this regular customer very much.
    "So, what kind of person is he?" I asked.
    "Him?" The young girl tilted her head and thought for a moment, then said, "I don't know what he does. He's not a cadre, nor is he a rich person. He's very kind, tall, and big..." The young girl suddenly stopped and pointed to the sidewalk across the street, "Look, he's coming again..."
  On the sidewalk, a young man was striding across the street towards us. He greeted the young girl with a smile from afar. The young girl waved to him. When the young man got closer, I could see him clearly: tall, with a strong build. From his big eyes, you could immediately feel that he was a young man who didn't know any sorrow. He had a blue jacket draped over his left shoulder, and his pockets were bulging, not knowing what was inside.
      "School's out?" the young man asked. The young girl nodded.
    The young man asked again, "Have you learned the whole song?"
      "There are still two lines that I can't sing well." So, the young man took out a songbook from his right pocket that had been flipped through so much that it was thick and dog-eared. "Here, take it and learn it. Give it back to me when you've learned it." The young man then took out a harmonica from his left pocket and quickly played the two lines that the young girl always had trouble singing.
      "Two pounds today," the young man said, while taking out money. Soon, the young man walked away happily with the fruit. I don't know what he does, but this happy young man, this young girl, this colorful and tempting fruit stand, the blooming peonies on the fruit stand, and the two lighthearted musical phrases beside the fruit stand, how could they not leave me with a beautiful living picture? Yes, at that time I wanted to find a painter, or find a musician to write these into a beautiful melody.
    On a Saturday evening, I was deep in thought about a problem on my way home, and unknowingly turned into a small street. Suddenly, in front of my eyes, a person emerged from a sewer manhole in the ground. I wasn't surprised; he was of course a sewer worker. But what surprised me was that this person was so familiar. On closer inspection, it turned out that he was the young man who bought fruit every day.
    He climbed up, put his tools into his pocket, walked to the entrance of a shop, turned on the roadside tap, and washed his head and face thoroughly. After a while, he went into the shop, changed out of his work clothes covered in mud, draped his jacket over his left shoulder, came out, turned on the tap again, took a big gulp of tap water, wiped his mouth, took out two steamed buns from his pocket, and walked away, eating as he went.
    I became increasingly interested in this young sewer worker.
    Indeed, he walked to the front of my house and stopped at the fruit stand. I immediately followed him. He looked at me, I looked at him, and we smiled. The young girl also smiled.
      "Give me a little more today. Today is my master's birthday!" the young man said cheerfully.
      "What?" the young girl asked curiously. "You've been buying it for your master?"
    "Is that not allowed?" the young man asked playfully. "My master... suffered a stroke, and is lying in bed unable to move, paralyzed, and almost sixty years old. I can't let the old man be sad, I want to make him happy..."
    "He's even older than my grandpa!" the young girl interjected.
    "Yes, he taught me all my skills. I love my master. Do you love your teacher?" The young girl's cheeks flushed. The young man walked away with the fruit, and after taking a few steps, he ran back as if he had remembered something.
      "That's right, it's my master's birthday, I should give him some flowers." The young man took out a few cents, "Help me pick a few peonies. It would be so nice to put them by my master's bedside!"
    "Do you have a bottle?"
      "No."
      "Then..." The young girl cleared out a jar on the stall and handed it to the young man, saying, "Take this."
    "Aren't you afraid your grandpa will scold you?"
      "Grandpa won't scold me."
  In this way, the young sewer worker, holding fruit and peonies, walked away happily, humming the song that the young girl liked to sing; moreover, his steps were lighter and bigger than usual. Soon, his tall figure disappeared into the crowd of people coming and going on the road.

    爱
    ——劳动者小记之三
    汪明
    我们的大门口，有一个水果摊，前些时候，它也卖卖刚上市的?药花。每天傍晚，我总喜欢在这个水果摊跟前逗留一会儿。大约也总是在这个时候吧，这个水果摊就由一个十三四岁的戴红领巾的小姑娘看管了。她喜欢唱歌和听故事，只要一看到我，就会要我讲故事给她听。这样，我便和这位小姑娘成了很好的朋友。
    她告诉我，每天六点钟左右，就会有一个老主顾来买水果。好几个月以来，这位老主顾天天都是这样的。看起来，小姑娘很喜欢这位老主顾。
    “那么，他是一个什么样的人呢？”我问。
    “他么？”小姑娘歪着头想了一下说：“不知道他是做什么的。不是干部，也不是什么有钱的人。人很和气，高高的个子，大大的……”小姑娘突然停住，往街对面的人行道一指，“你看，他又来了……”
  人行道上一个小伙子迈着大步，穿过马路向我们这边走过来。还在老远的地方他就笑嘻嘻地给小姑娘打招呼了。小姑娘向他招招手。小伙子走近了，我才完全把他看清楚：高高的个子，身体很结实，从他的那一双大眼睛里你便会立刻感觉到他是一个不懂得什么忧愁的年青人。左肩膀上搭着一件蓝外套，口袋里咕咕嘟嘟地不知道装了些什么。
      “放学了？”小伙子问。小姑娘点点头。
    小伙子又问：“那支歌，全学会了？”
      “还有两句总是唱不好。”于是，小伙子从右边口袋里摸出了一本已经被翻得厚厚的卷了边的歌本。“来，给你，学吧。学会了再还给我。”小伙子又从左边口袋里掏出了一个口琴，那么快的吹了小姑娘总是唱不好的那两句。
      “今天称二斤。”年青人一边掏钱一边说。一会儿，年青人捧着水果高高兴兴地走了。我不知道他是做什么的，但是这快乐的年青人，这小姑娘，这红红绿绿的诱人的水果摊，水果摊上盛开的?药花，和这水果摊旁的两段轻快的乐句，怎么能不给我留下一幅美丽的活的图画的印象呢？是呵，当时我想寻找画家，或者找一位音乐家把这些写进一个优美的旋律里去。
    星期六的傍晚，我在回家的路上为一个问题沉思默想着，不知不觉地便拐进了一条小街。突然，在我的眼前，从地面上的下水道圆洞里钻出一个人来。我不奇怪，他当然是一位下水道工人。但使我奇怪的是：这个人我是这样的面熟。仔细一看，原来他就是那个天天买水果的年青人。
    他钻上来，把工具装到衣袋里，走到一家店铺门口，扭开路旁的自来水龙头，满头满脸地洗起来了。一会儿，他走进那家店铺，换下了他那一身沾满了污泥的工作服，把上衣往左肩上一搭，走出来，又扭开龙头，大口大口地喝了几口自来水，擦了擦嘴，从衣袋里摸出了两个馒头，一边吃，一边迈着大步走开了。
    我对这位年青的下水道工人越来越感到兴趣了。
    确实是那样的，他走到我的家门口，在水果摊旁站住了。我立即跟上去。他看看我，我看看他，我们笑了。那小姑娘，也笑了。
      “今儿多称一点儿。今儿是我师傅的生日哩！”年青人开朗地说。
      “怎么？”小姑娘奇怪了。“你一直是买给你师傅吃的？”
    “难道不行么？”小伙子顽皮地反问着。“我师傅……得了半身不遂症，躺在床上不能动，瘫了，都快六十岁了。不能让老人家难过，要让他快活。……”
    “比我爷爷还要大呀！”小姑娘插嘴说。
    “是呵，我的手艺都是他教的。我爱我的师傅。你说，你爱你的老师么？”小姑娘的两片脸颊红了。小伙子捧着水果走了，刚走几步，像想起了什么似地跑了回来。
      “对了，师傅的生日，应当送一把花的呀。”小伙子掏出了几毛钱，“帮我选几枝?药花吧。在我师傅床头一放，多好呵！”
    “有瓶子么？”
      “没有。”
      “那……”小姑娘把摊子上的一个罐子腾出来，递到小伙子面前说：“把这个拿去吧。”
    “不怕你爷爷骂你？”
      “爷爷不骂。”
  这样，这位年青的下水道工人，捧着水果和?药花，哼着小姑娘喜欢唱的那支歌子高高兴兴地走了；而且，那步伐比往常还要轻捷，还要迈得大些。一会儿，他那高高大大的背影便消失在马路上南来北往的人群里了。
