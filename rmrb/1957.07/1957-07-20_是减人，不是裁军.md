    It's Reducing Personnel, Not Disarmament
    U.S. Defense Secretary Wilson announced an order on the 16th, requiring the Army, Navy, and Air Force to reduce personnel by 100,000 by the end of this year. Readers should not think that while the United States is putting forward a string of confusing "suggestions" in the disarmament negotiations, making the negotiations completely irrelevant, it is actually implementing a disarmament plan. That would be falling for it. We should instead explore what is hidden in the bones of this seemingly contradictory approach.
    Is it a reduction? In terms of personnel numbers, yes. And it will therefore reduce some expenses. According to Wilson's order, it's two hundred million dollars. But to say this is the first step in a disarmament policy is far from the case.
      This announced reduction of armed forces personnel is part of the so-called "New, New Look" military plan that the United States has been brewing for a long time. According to this plan, personnel may be further reduced. Isn't this a disarmament plan? Not at all. This is a new policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war.
    The so-called "New, New Look" plan means making some adjustments to the original plan for expanding armaments and preparing for war under the new situation. In a word, it is to focus the expansion of armaments and war preparations mainly on the so-called "nuclear deterrent force." It is something that has developed after the United States' consistent pursuit of the "policy of strength" after the war has repeatedly hit walls.
    In the past eleven years, the United States has extremely expanded its influence in the capitalist world, and coerced a group of large and small lackey countries to follow it in preparing for a new global war. As a result of extreme expansion, even the United States' strong economic strength is becoming increasingly unbearable. Representatives of some bourgeoisies have repeatedly issued warning signals, worrying that the unlimited expansion of armaments is in danger of rapidly leading to a total economic collapse. They advocate putting the expansion of armaments on a more stable long-term basis. For this issue, the U.S. ruling group once argued fiercely, until the Secretary of the Treasury resigned because of disagreements with the President.
    The ever-increasing burden of armaments not only makes the monopoly capitalists rich, but also makes the whole country complain. Eisenhower's unprecedentedly huge military budget for peacetime in 1957-1958 even stirred up public sentiment. Eisenhower made two television speeches especially for his "security budget," appealing to the whole country. But members of Congress quickly discovered that Eisenhower's "popularity" was also useless. They then made a fuss in Congress and made some insignificant cuts to the budget to ease public anger.
    U.S. strategic planners also have an unspeakable grievance. After so many years of preparing for war, the United States' hope of winning in a new full-scale war is becoming increasingly slim. People all over the world strongly demand peace. Even in the United States, where gunpowder is the strongest, people generally oppose war, and the proportion of people who advocate U.S.-Soviet reconciliation is increasing. Therefore, the heads of the U.S. government have finally been forced to sing the tune of peaceful coexistence. Although some influential figures are still unwilling to give up, they have to repeatedly weigh: can we win if we fight? The conclusion is always "no." This situation, which they call a "nuclear stalemate," forces them to "re-examine" their policies.
    There is no certainty of victory in war, and there is a lack of confidence in peaceful competition; the extreme expansion of armaments and economic stability cannot be achieved at the same time, and abandoning the most profitable military orders is also undesirable. In a dilemma, Washington has to find a way out from the cracks in the middle. Some well-versed writers in the United States compare the current U.S. policy to walking a tightrope, which can be said to be vivid and pertinent. The new and new look of military strategy is really a reflection of poverty. Washington's strategists are now pinning their hopes mainly on the blackmailing effect of nuclear weapons, which is the last resort of hooligans.
    From this, it can be seen that the United States has made some reductions in the number of armed forces, which is out of strategic necessity, and is not the kind of disarmament that the people of all countries demand. Americans themselves admit that this is only part of a plan to "modernize" the military. This reduction has no impact on the profits of monopoly capitalists, nor does it change the fundamental policy of continuing to prepare for war. Therefore, it can be said that this is reducing personnel rather than disarmament.
    However, reducing the army is a thing that can win people's hearts, so it is very beneficial to publicize it.
    In order to change its passive position, the U.S. government played a lot of tricks in the London disarmament negotiations. But no matter how well the tricks are played, they will inevitably be exposed after a long time. Magicians need some kind of effect to divert the audience's attention.
    Furthermore, in view of the optimistic atmosphere at the beginning of the negotiations, which caused fluctuations in the U.S. economy, and the tendency of allies to become centrifugal has also increased, U.S. officials have recently been trying to complicate matters. When Dulles answered reporters' questions about disarmament on the 16th, he talked in circles, actually saying: "Everything about the disarmament issue is still uncertain, so no agreement can be reached, and the United States must continue to develop nuclear weapons. But how can things begin to settle down? There must be an agreement that meets the minimum conditions!" Quibbling over words is commonplace for the Secretary of State, who is a lawyer, and his various helpers. But the public has reason to suspect that the Americans are really trying to reach an agreement and disarm?
    Washington's psychological warfare experts then thought that announcing a reduction of 100,000 armed forces at this time would help dilute this growing doubt, thereby shielding U.S. negotiators and delaying disarmament negotiations as much as possible, for example, at least until after the West German elections, and then make plans. The U.S. representative has indicated that he needs several more weeks to complete his proposal, and by then—this is what Dulles has already hinted at in his speech—the United States hopes to have another period of adjournment. The date of the West German election is in mid-September.
    Exposed, the U.S. decision to reduce 100,000 people is all about this. Using a small strategic adjustment necessary to achieve the purpose of publicity.
      At present, the main threat to mankind is nuclear weapons and nuclear tests; the main danger to the world is nuclear weapons war. Therefore, the most urgent demand of the people of all countries is to ban nuclear weapons, first of all to stop nuclear tests. The attitude in this regard should be the main measure of whether or not one agrees with disarmament. Avoiding this point, "disarmament" is just a guise.

### 是减人，不是裁军

    是减人，不是裁军
    美国国防部长威尔逊在16日宣布一项命令，要海陆空三军在今年年底以前减少十万人员。读者不要以为，当美国在裁军谈判中提出成串扑朔迷离的“建议”，使谈判完全不靠边的时候，却实际上执行起裁军计划来。那样就上当了。我们倒是应当探究，这种看来是相互矛盾的作法，骨子里藏着什么东西。
    是不是裁减了？就人员数目说，是的。并且因此将减少一部分费用。按照威尔逊命令中说是两亿美元。但是要说这是裁军政策的第一步，远不是那么一回事。
      这次宣布的裁减武装部队人员，是美国酝酿已久的所谓“新新面貌”军事计划的一部分。按照这个计划，人员还可能要进一步减少。这岂不是裁军计划？一点也不是。这是新方针的扩军备战计划。
    所谓“新新面貌”计划，是在新形势下对原来的扩军备战计划作某种调整的意思，一句话就是把扩军备战的重点主要放在所谓“核威慑力量”上面。它是美国战后一贯推行的“实力地位政策”在不断碰壁之后发展起来的东西。
    在过去的十一年间，美国在资本主义世界里边极度地扩张了它的势力，并裹胁了一批大小喽啰国家跟着它准备新的全球战争。极度伸展的结果，即使是美国雄厚的经济实力，也愈来愈吃不消了。一部分资产阶级的代表已经再三发出警号，担心无限度的军备扩张有迅速导致经济总崩溃的危险。他们主张把军备扩张摆在一个比较稳当的长期的基础上。为了这个问题，美国统治集团内部曾经争吵得十分激烈，直到财政部长因同总统意见不合提出了辞职。
    有加无已的军备重担，固然使垄断资本家利市百倍，却弄得全国怨声载道。艾森豪威尔1957—1958年度和平时期空前庞大的军事预算，更使民情沸腾。艾森豪威尔为了他的“安全预算”，特地发表两次电视广播演说，向全国呼吁。但是国会议员们很快就发现，艾森豪威尔的“人望”也不中用。他们这才在国会里哄闹了一阵，把预算作了一些无关大体的削减，以缓和民愤。
    美国的战略策划人还有一个说不出口的苦衷。备战搞了这么多年，美国要在一次新的全面战争中获胜的希望却愈来愈渺茫了。全世界的人民都强烈要求和平。就在火药气最浓的美国，人民也普遍反对战争，而且主张美苏和好的人占的比重愈来愈大。所以美国政府首脑终于也被迫唱起和平共处的调子来了。尽管一些颇有势力的当权人物心犹不死，但是他们不得不反复权衡：打起来能胜吗？结论总是个“不”字。这种局面，他们称之为“核子僵局”，逼着他们“重新审查”他们的政策。
    战争既无胜利把握，和平竞赛又缺乏信心；军备的极度扩张和经济的稳定不可得兼，放弃最有利可图的军事订货又非所愿。左右为难，华盛顿只好从中间的夹缝中找出路。美国一些善弄辞藻的文人，把美国目前的政策比诸走钢丝的，可算是生动而中肯。军事战略面貌新而又新，实在是穷之又穷的反映。华盛顿的战略家们现在把希望主要寄托在核武器的敲诈作用上，这是最后的一手流氓办法。
    由此可见，美国把武装部队人数作了一些削减，实是出于战略上的必要，并非是各国人民所要求的那种裁军。美国人自己也承认，这不过是使军队“现代化”的计划的一部分。这种削减，对于垄断资本家的利润是毫无影响的，也一点不改变继续准备战争的根本方针。因此可以说，这是减人而非裁军。
    不过，削减军队是一件能得人心的事情，因此拿出来宣传一下大有好处。
    美国政府为了改变自己的被动地位，在伦敦裁军谈判中耍了不少的花样。但是把戏玩得再好，拖长了不免要露马脚。魔术师需要某种效果来转移观众的注意。
    再者，鉴于谈判初期的乐观气氛，引起了美国经济的波动，盟国的离心倾向也因而增加，美国官方近日正竭力要使事情复杂化。杜勒斯16日在回答记者们关于裁军的一些问题时，兜了许多圈子，实际上是说：“裁军问题的一切都还在未定之天，因此不能成立任何协议，美国必须继续发展核武器。但是怎样才能够使得事情开始定下来呢？必须要有满足起码条件的协议！”搬弄字句对于讼师出身的国务卿及其各色帮闲，是家常便饭。但是公众却有理由怀疑，美国人的作法，能是真心想求得协议和裁军的吗？
    华盛顿的心理战专家于是想到，在这个时候宣布削减武装部队十万，会有助于冲淡日益增加的这种疑虑，因而可以掩护美国谈判代表，把裁军谈判尽量拖延下去，譬如说，至少拖到西德大选之后，再作打算。美国代表已表示他还得要几个星期的时间来提完他的建议，而到那时，——这是杜勒斯在谈话中已经暗示了的——美国希望再能休会一个时期。西德的大选日期是9月中。
    戳穿了，美国削减十万人的决定就是这么一回事。利用一种战略上必要的小小调整，来达到宣传的目的。
      目前，对人类的主要威胁是核武器和核试验；对世界的主要危险是核武器战争。所以各国人民最迫切要求的就是禁止核武器，首先是停止核试验。在这方面的态度应当是是否赞同裁军的主要衡量标准。避开这一点，“裁军”就不过是一个幌子。
