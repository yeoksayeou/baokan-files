I fully agree with the reports of the State Council, the Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

From the facts and figures listed in these reports, it is clear how exciting are the brilliant achievements our people have made under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction! As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "As long as we continue to work hard, strengthen unity at home and abroad, and implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and building the country diligently and thriftily, no force in the world can stop the victorious advance of our great socialist cause." Based on my own personal experience, I can deeply understand the significance of this statement. Here, I would like to express some opinions on some of the experiences our troops have gained in the practice of production and construction.

    Changed the Face of Nature

In 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xinjiang, responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, combined the tasks of defending the motherland's borders and building the motherland's borders, and participated in various economic construction tasks, with the main effort being land reclamation. The conditions at that time were very difficult, but we never bowed our heads to difficulties and fought against nature with unparalleled production enthusiasm. Relying on the help and guidance of local farmers, we searched for water sources, arranged farmland, and learned farming techniques. In the development of production, we started with production first and construction later, then production and construction simultaneously, while always learning during production. On the basis of overcoming initial difficulties, after entering the First Five-Year Plan, the production team grew, the cultivated area expanded with the expansion of water conservancy projects, the economic crops expanded, animal husbandry production developed, and other industries such as construction, transportation, processing of by-products, and cooperative businesses grew year by year. Now, nine reservoirs have been built with a total storage capacity of over 220 million cubic meters, 72 main canals and drainage canals with a total water transmission capacity of 391 cubic meters per second, and an irrigation capacity of over 3.49 million mu. Currently, 44 farms have been planned and designed, and out of the total cultivated area of more than 4.9 million mu, 2.4 million mu have been reclaimed and sown this year, and the degree of mechanization of cultivation has reached 51.6%. In some of the regularized farms, the fields are level, each block is four to five hundred mu, the tree belts are planted in more than ten rows, green and shady, the canals and roads are side by side, like a chessboard, iron oxen can gallop horizontally and vertically, and the crops grow like a carpet, which is completely different from the situation in 1950 when small plots of land were cultivated with two oxen carrying a beam, turning corners and gasping for breath. This is reflected in the increase in the total output of crops and the yield per unit area: in 1953, the area of grain crops expanded to more than 740,000 mu, with an average yield of 165 jin per mu, which was 156% of that in 1950, and the cotton area expanded to more than 60,000 mu, with an average yield of 222 jin of seed cotton per mu, which was 370% of that in 1950, and for the first time, a record of 402 jin per mu was created in 20,000 mu of large-field cotton. By 1956, the area of grain crops expanded to 980,000 mu, with an average yield of 199.4 jin per mu, which was 190.8% of that in 1950, and the cotton area expanded to 360,000 mu, although it suffered from the major natural disasters of hail in May, low temperature in June, and early frost in September, the average yield still reached 174 jin per mu, which was 290% of that in 1950. In terms of total output, taking 1950 as the base, the grain increased by two times in 1956, oil crops increased by more than one time, and cotton increased by 174 times. The number of large and small livestock reached more than 690,000 heads at the beginning of 1956. With the development of production and the general upsurge of the national economy, the living standards of production fighters have gradually improved, and purchasing power has continued to increase. If the purchasing power in 1951 is 100, it has increased year by year to 395 in 1955. In terms of culture and welfare, each farm has fairly large-scale nurseries, primary schools, clubs, canteens, medical clinics, shops, post offices, bookstores, banks, film projection teams, etc., as well as broadcasting equipment. New-type cities have emerged on the Gobi Desert. In just a few short years, under the glory of socialism, in peaceful labor, the face of nature has been changed and is constantly changing. Faced with this situation, we deeply appreciate the meaning and pleasure of Premier Zhou's report that "a better life must be created by one's own hard work." There is nothing more exciting than this: to be able to change the face of the motherland with our own hands, to enrich the motherland's agricultural resources and strengthen the motherland's national economic strength with our own labor products, and to share the increasingly growing happy life of the people of the motherland. Of course, we also understand that this is only the starting point of a long and arduous struggle, and we still have more important tasks ahead for mastering science and technology, improving business management, and expanding production and development. At the same time, in our land reclamation and development of state-owned agriculture and animal husbandry, some places have conflicts of interest with the people, affecting the relationship between the production troops and the people, and we should strive to correct this immediately. But we have the strength and confidence that the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state will definitely be completed. Our partial achievements are insignificant in the entire national economic composition, but they are closely related to the country's great achievements, and the leaping development of our motherland is a solid guarantee for our continuous victories.

    The Superiority of the Socialist Mode of Production

How did we achieve these achievements?

First, this is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Adapting to the specific conditions of Xinjiang, the Party assigned us specific production tasks, continuously cared for us, and supported us, enabling us to overcome the initial extreme difficulties and lay a favorable foundation for long-term planning.

Second, this is inseparable from the fine traditions of the long-tested Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership and education of the Party. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has undergone long and arduous tests, with an indomitable spirit, a high degree of organization and discipline, and a high degree of class consciousness and production enthusiasm. Our corps includes uprising troops. After joining the big family of the People's Liberation Army, the uprising troops, under the education and training of the Party, received the help and care of brotherly troops, studied and worked together, absorbed the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and gradually transformed themselves into new people who could engage in labor production and love labor production. Several years of joint labor and exposure have made the entire army unite like milk and water. This is one of the important conditions for achieving victory on the production front.

Third, this is inseparable from the superiority of the socialist mode of production. Under the education of socialist consciousness, the mode of production of collective production and planned production on vast land, using scientific farming methods, has exerted tremendous production efficiency. People's ideology has also undergone new changes with the new mode, which has provided possible conditions for expanding high-yield areas and creating top records. Last year, there were more than 10,700 mu of corn with 1,000 jin per mu, more than 15 mu of cotton with 1,000 jin per mu, and more than 19,900 mu of wheat with 440 jin per mu, and both the area and yield are increasing year by year, which is a clear example. As for creating the highest national record, in terms of cotton, first there was the Liu Xuefo team with 1,392 jin per mu, followed by the Xue Zhanchun team with 1,686 jin per mu; in terms of corn, first there was the Pan Dayong team with 1,344 jin per mu, followed by the He Tianyi team with 1,926 jin per mu. This is the result of the continuous mutual traction of new records in the socialist production competition. The constantly growing production upsurge is thus encouraged. Moreover, due to the influence of the development of production in the military reclamation farms in recent years, the farmers of all ethnic groups near the reclamation area have gradually accepted advanced ideas and advanced agricultural science and technology, thereby promoting them to embark on the road of cooperativization and improving agricultural production. All of this vividly reflects the superiority of socialism.

Fourth, this is inseparable from the glorious illumination of the Party's ethnic policy, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, and the unity of the army and the people. In the eight years of production, we have deeply realized that the reason why we have been able to overcome many difficulties and accomplish our tasks is because under the unified leadership of the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the local leadership organs at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups have given us great support, and because of the close unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups. Without this condition, it would be difficult for us to have such achievements today. For example, water conservancy projects and farm planning and design projects were carried out with the enthusiastic help of the relevant organs of the Autonomous Region. In 1956, the basic construction project was very heavy, and there was a shortage of materials. The Autonomous Region saved the materials it needed and timely supported the construction of our three larger reservoir projects and irrigation projects. When our production undertakings had some conflicts with the interests of the masses in terms of water, soil, and pastures, the party and government leading organs at all levels proceeded from the long-term interests of both parties and made proper arrangements and handling. If it were not for the Party's correct ethnic policy that has united the people of all ethnic groups into an equal, friendly, and closely united big family, that would not be possible.

Fifth, this is inseparable from the help given by the experts of the great ally, the Soviet Union. In recent years, we have received the help of Soviet experts in farmland water conservancy, architectural design, and various technical guidance, and absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This experience has played and will continue to play a very important role in production practice.

    The Spirit of the Great Production in Nanniwan Has Been Manifested Again

In February of this year, in response to the Central Committee's call for increasing production and practicing economy, we streamlined the organization, reduced non-production personnel, and called on cadres to return to production with the slogan "voluntary application, organized approval." There were more than 8,600 people, including more than 2,000 young students who entered Xinjiang last year. Their enthusiasm for labor is very high, especially the Party and League cadres, who account for more than 60%. Among them are those who in the past laid down their hoes and went to the battlefield for the liberation of the whole country, and won the title of combat hero. Today, inspired by the upsurge of socialist construction, they have put down their leadership work again, happily returned to the production post, buried themselves in hard work, and are not afraid of fatigue. They go to work first and leave work last. The spirit of the Great Production in Nanniwan in those years has been manifested again today. Under the leadership and influence of the cadres, the young students also voluntarily accepted the training of labor production and participated in the production ranks, regardless of leg pain, back pain, and blisters on their hands. Some of them said: "We have been in school all the time before entering Xinjiang, and we have no practical knowledge at all. This time, we must be able to withstand hard training in production. Only through this training can we become familiar with the grassroots, the masses, and production, so that we can become good cadres in the future." Some said: "Many of our old cadres in the farm fought north and south for the revolution in the past, and did not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice. They are all meritorious people. Now they are responding to the Party's call and actively producing. We have never suffered a day of hardship, so we should work harder." Others said: "The Communist Party is really wise. Having surplus cadres participate in production is one of the best ways to increase production and practice economy. If the number of people who are divorced from production increases day by day, and the number of people who do the work decreases day by day, how can socialist construction be accelerated?" What touching facts and words! The improvement of the socialist consciousness of the masses fully demonstrates the effect of the Party's correct leadership and education. And a few people with relatively low consciousness, and even those with resistant emotions, will also change quickly under the continuous education of the Party and under the influence and promotion of the majority of advanced elements. I think such a thing, whether from the point of view of increasing production and practicing economy, or from the point of view of mobilizing young students to participate in agricultural production, has practical significance and should be valued and advocated.

As mentioned earlier, the achievements we have made in production and construction in recent years are insignificant compared with the scale of national production development, but the path we have experienced from small to large and from scratch vividly illustrates the fundamental reason why we can have these achievements, that is, the great role of the Party's leadership and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist line. We have a common saying, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China." I feel this sentence particularly deeply. I firmly believe that without the Communist Party, there would be none of this small but very significant undertaking of ours. Without the Communist Party, there would be no new face of Xinjiang. However, in a recent period, a small handful of right-wing elements took advantage of the opportunity of the Party to carry out rectification and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. They openly issued counter-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist fallacies, attempting to cancel or weaken the Party's great leadership role in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and attempting to deviate from the socialist line, which is absolutely not allowed by the people of the whole country. According to the materials constantly revealed in various aspects recently, the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements are organized, planned, programmed, and routed, and are a political conspiracy that has been brewing for a long time and has been active for a long time. They firmly stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, still yearn for the pseudo-democratic system of the bourgeoisie, and vainly attempt to destroy the socialist system, destroy the people's democratic dictatorship, and allow the restoration of capitalism. They want to cancel the leadership of the Communist Party and want to create their "world." This political conspiracy, which is self-inflicted and cut off from the people of the whole country, will inevitably be crushed.

I am a soldier who has been stationed on the border for many years, and have experienced two completely different eras: the Kuomintang rule before liberation and the era of the people of all ethnic groups being the masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Communist Party after liberation. Based on my personal experience, I believe that as long as those who put the bright future of the motherland and the happiness of future generations in their hearts will inevitably sincerely love the Chinese Communist Party, love the people's regime, and love socialism. We will never allow a few bourgeois political careerists to drag our country into the abyss of darkness. All the commanders and fighters of the national defense army and the production and construction corps stationed in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region regard the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland as more precious than their own lives. We are determined to unite with the people of the whole country to fight to the end to defend our sacred socialist cause and to completely crush the political conspiracy of the bourgeois right-wing elements. We are determined to better combine the tasks of defending the motherland's borders and building the motherland's borders, more vigorously carry out the hard work of socialism, and strive for more and greater achievements to contribute to the great socialist cause of the motherland!

    没有任何力量可以阻挡  社会主义事业胜利前进
    陶峙岳谈驻在新疆的解放军部队在生产建设实践中的体验
    我完全同意国务院、常务委员会、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的报告。
    从这些报告所列举的事实和数字中，很清楚地看到，我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中所取得的光辉成就，是多么令人兴奋！周总理报告最后指出：“只要我们继续努力，加强国内外团结，贯彻执行增产节约、勤俭建国的方针，世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡我们伟大的社会主义事业胜利前进。”根据我自己的切身体会，是能够十分深刻地理解这句话的重要意义的。在这里，我要就我们部队在生产建设实践中所得到的一些体验，发表一点意见。
    改变了大自然的面貌
    一九五○年，驻在新疆的中国人民解放军部队，响应党中央和毛主席的号召，把保卫祖国边疆和建设祖国边疆的任务结合起来，参加了各项经济建设工作，主要力量是进行开渠垦荒。当时的条件是很艰苦的，我们绝未向困难低头，以无比高涨的生产热情向大自然进行斗争。依靠当地农民的帮助和指导，寻找水源、安排耕地、学习耕作技术。我们在生产发展中，开始是先生产后建设，继而是边生产边建设，同时始终是边生产边学习的。在战胜初步困难的基础上，进入到第一个五年计划以后，生产队伍的壮大，耕地面积随着水利工程的扩展而扩展，经济作物的扩大，畜牧生产的发展，其它如建筑、运输、加工副业和合作事业等，都是逐年增长的。现在已建成水库九处，蓄水总容量为二亿二千多万公方，总干渠和排水渠七十二条，输水总能力三百九十一秒公方，灌溉能力为三百四十九万多亩。现已规划设计农场四十四处，在耕地总面积四百九十多万亩中，今年已开垦播种二百四十万亩，耕作的机械化程度已达到百分之五十一点六。在已正规化的部分农场中，田块平整，每块四五百亩，林带植树十数行，翠绿成荫，渠道与道路并列，好似棋盘，铁牛可以纵横驰骋，作物生长铺地如茵，较之一九五○年在小块土地上，用二牛抬杠耕作起来，转弯抹角，喘气不前的情况，已经完全不同了。反映在作物的总产量和单位面积产量的增长上是这样的：一九五三年原粮面积扩大到七十四万多亩，平均亩产一百六十五斤，为一九五○年的百分之一百五十六，棉花面积扩大到六万多亩，平均亩产籽棉二百二十二斤，为一九五○年的百分之三百七十，并且初次创造了二万亩大田棉花，每亩丰产四百零二斤的纪录。到一九五六年，原粮面积扩大到九十八万亩，平均亩产一百九十九点四斤，为一九五○年的百分之一百九十点八，棉花面积扩大到三十六万亩，虽遭受到五月冰雹、六月低温、九月早霜的特大天灾，平均亩产仍达一百七十四斤，为一九五○年的百分之二百九十。就总产量来说，如以一九五○年作为基数，则一九五六年粮食提高了两倍，油料作物提高了一倍强，棉花提高了一百七十四倍。大小牲畜在一九五六年初已达到六十九万多头。随着生产的发展以及国民经济的普遍高涨，生产战士的生活逐步得到改善，购买力不断地增长，如以一九五一年的购买力为一百，则逐年增长到一九五五年为三百九十五。在文化福利方面，各农场都有相当规模的托儿所、小学校、俱乐部、食堂、医疗所、商店、邮局、书店、银行、电影放映队等，还有广播设备。在戈壁滩上涌现出新型城市。只是经过短短几年间，在社会主义的光辉下，在和平劳动中，改变了和不断改变着大自然的面貌。面对这种情况，我们深深体会到周总理报告中所提出“美好的生活，是必须用自己的辛勤劳动去创造”的意义和愉快。没有比这样的事情更使我们兴奋了，这就是：能用自己的双手来改变着祖国大地的面貌，能用自己的劳动产品来丰富祖国的农业资源，增强祖国的国民经济力量，并且分享到祖国人民日益增长的幸福生活。当然，我们更懂得这不过是长期艰巨斗争的起点，我们对于科学技术的掌握，对于经营管理的改进，对于生产扩大发展，还有更重大的任务在前面。同时，我们在开垦荒地发展国营农牧中，有些地方和人民群众的利益发生矛盾，影响了生产部队和人民的关系，应即力求改正。但我们是有力量、有信心的，党和国家交给我们的任务是一定能够完成的。我们的局部成就虽在整个国民经济组成中是微不足道的，但与国家的巨大成就是息息相关的，我们祖国的飞跃发展，就是我们不断取得胜利的坚确保证。
    社会主义生产方式的优越性
    我们是怎样取得这些成就的呢？
    第一，这是与中国共产党的英明领导分不开的。适应新疆的特定情况，党交给我们特定的生产任务，不断地关怀我们，支援我们，使我们渡过了初期的极端困难，奠定了长远规划的有利基础。
    第二，这是与在党领导和教养下的久经锻炼的中国人民解放军的优良传统分不开的。中国人民解放军经历了长期艰苦的考验，具有坚忍不拔的精神，高度的组织性和纪律性，高度的阶级觉悟和生产热情。我们兵团中包括有起义部队在内。起义部队在参加了人民解放军的大家庭以后，在党的教育培养下，得到兄弟部队的帮助和关怀，共同学习，共同劳动，吸取了人民解放军的优良传统，逐渐把自己改造成为能够劳动生产并热爱劳动生产的新人。几年的共同劳动和耳濡目染，使全军团结得水乳交融。这是在生产战线上能够取得胜利的重要条件之一。
    第三，这是与社会主义生产方式的优越性分不开的。在社会主义觉悟教育下，在广大的土地上，进行集体生产和计划生产的生产方式，使用科学化的耕作方法，从而发挥了巨大的生产效能。人们的思想意识，随着新的方式，也起了新的变化，这就为扩大丰产面积、创造最高纪录提供了可能的条件。去年每亩千斤玉米有一万零七百多亩，每亩千斤棉花有十五亩多，每亩四百四十斤小麦有一万九千九百多亩，在面积和产量都是逐年提高的，这就是明显的例证。至于创造全国最高纪录，在棉花方面，先有刘学佛小组的每亩一千三百九十二斤，继有薛占春小组的每亩一千六百八十六斤；在玉米方面，先有潘大勇小组的每亩一千三百四十四斤，继有贺天宜小组的每亩一千九百二十六斤。这是由于在社会主义生产竞赛中，新纪录不断地互相牵引的结果。不断增长的生产热潮，就是这样鼓舞起来的。而且由于军垦农场几年来生产发展的影响，垦区附近的各族农民也逐渐接受了先进思想和先进农业科学技术，从而促进他们走向合作化的道路和提高了农业生产。所有这一切，都鲜明地反映了社会主义的优越性。
    第四，这是与党的民族政策的光辉照耀、各族人民的团结、军民的团结分不开的。在八年的生产过程中，我们深深体会到：我们所以能够克服许多困难，达成任务，是由于在新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会统一领导之下，地方各级领导机关和各族人民给我们大力的支援，是由于各族人民的亲密团结合作。如果没有这一个条件，我们是很难有今天这样的成就的。例如水利工程和农场规划设计工程都是在自治区有关机关的热情帮助下进行的。一九五六年的基本建设工程十分繁重，材料不足，自治区节约自己需用的物资，及时地支援了我们三个较大的水库工程和灌溉工程建设。当我们的生产事业在水、土和草场方面与群众利益发生某些矛盾时，各级党政领导机关都从双方长远利益出发，做了妥善的安排和处理。如果不是党的正确的民族政策把各族人民结成一个平等友爱亲密团结的大家庭，那是不可能的。
    第五，这是和伟大盟邦苏联专家给予的帮助分不开的。几年来，无论在农田水利上，建筑设计上，和各项技术指导上，都得到不辞辛勤的苏联专家的帮助，吸取了苏联的先进经验。这些经验在生产实践起了并将继续起着十分重要的作用。
    南泥湾大生产精神又表现出来了
    在今年二月间，我们响应中央增产节约的号召，精减机构，减少了非生产人员，以“自愿申请，组织批准”号召干部回到生产中去的，有八千六百多人，其中有二千多是去年进疆的青年学生。他们的劳动热情都很高，特别是占百分之六十以上的党团员干部。其中有过去为全国解放，放下锄头，走上战场，荣膺战斗英雄称号，今天在社会主义建设高潮的鼓舞下，又放下领导工作，愉快地回到生产岗位，埋头苦干，劳瘁不辞，上工在前，下工在后，当年南泥湾大生产的精神，今天又表现出来了。在干部带头和影响下，青年学生也自愿接受劳动生产的锻炼，参加了生产行列，腿酸腰疼、手磨血泡，在所不顾。他们有的说：“我们未进疆，一直在学校，一点实际知识也没有，此次到生产中去，一定要经得起艰苦的锻炼，只有经过这种锻炼，才能熟悉基层，熟悉群众，熟悉生产，将来才能当个好干部。”有的说：“我们农场里很多老干部，过去为革命南征北战，不惜流血牺牲，都是有功绩的人，现在又响应党的号召，积极生产，我们一天苦也没有吃过，更要好好劳动才对。”还有的这样说：“共产党真英明，编余干部参加生产是最好的增产节约办法之一。如果脱离生产的人一天天的多，动手干活的人一天天的少，那社会主义建设怎么能加快呢？”这是多么令人感动的事实和语言！群众的社会主义觉悟的提高，充分说明党的正确领导和教育的效果。而少数觉悟比较低、甚至还有抵触情绪的人，也将在党的不断教育下，在大多数先进分子的影响带动下，很快改变过来。我认为这样一件事，无论从增产节约的观点来看，从发动青年学生参加农业生产的观点来看，都具有现实的意义，应当重视，应当提倡。
    前面说过，我们几年来生产建设中的成就和全国生产发展的规模相比较，是微不足道的，但是我们所经历过的从小到大、从无到有的一段途径，生动地说明我们所以能有这些成就的根本原因，就是党的领导的伟大作用和社会主义路线的无比优越性。我们有句通俗的语言，叫做“没有共产党就没有新中国。”对这句话，我的感受特别深。我深信：没有共产党，也就没有我们这一点微小的但是意义十分重大的事业。没有共产党，也就没有新疆的新面貌。可是在最近的一个时期中，竟有一小撮右派分子利用党进行整风的机会，猖狂地向党发动进攻。他们公然发出反党、反人民、反社会主义的谬论，妄图取消或削弱党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的伟大领导作用，妄图离开社会主义路线，这是全国人民所绝对不能容许的。根据最近各方面不断揭发的材料看来，右派分子的反动言行是有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线的，蓄意已久而且早就在活动着的一种政治阴谋。他们坚决站在资产阶级的立场，还憧憬资产阶级的伪民主制度，妄想破坏社会主义制度、破坏人民民主专政，让资本主义复辟。他们想取消共产党领导，想打出他们的“天下”来。这种自绝于全国人民的政治阴谋，必然遭到粉碎的打击。
    我是多年驻在边疆的一个军人，经历过解放以前国民党统治和解放以后在共产党领导下各族人民当家做主的两个迥然不同的时代，根据我切身的体认，我以为只要是把祖国的光明前途和子孙后代的幸福放在心上的人，就必然衷心热爱中国共产党，热爱人民政权，热爱社会主义。我们决不让少数资产阶级政治野心家把我们国家拖到黑暗的深渊里去。驻在新疆维吾尔自治区的国防军和生产建设部队全体指战员，对于祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的成果，看成比自己生命还要宝贵。我们坚决和全国人民一起，为捍卫我们社会主义的神圣事业，为彻底粉碎资产阶级右派分子的政治阴谋而斗争到底，我们决心要把保卫祖国边疆和建设祖国边疆的任务更好地结合起来，更加奋发地进行社会主义的辛勤劳动，争取更多更大的成绩来贡献给祖国伟大的社会主义事业！
