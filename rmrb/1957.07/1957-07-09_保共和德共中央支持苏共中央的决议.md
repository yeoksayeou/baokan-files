Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, issued separate statements regarding the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet on the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich and Molotov.

    The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a statement on July 7, stating that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party welcomes and fully supports the resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. This resolution proves the firm Marxist-Leninist unity of the CPSU and its Central Committee, and proves their strong will to guide the Soviet people along the path stipulated by the 20th Party Congress. We are deeply convinced that the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee will promote the complete victory of the line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, help further develop the international communist and workers' movement, and more broadly carry out the struggle of democratic and progressive forces around the world for peace and socialism, for improving international peaceful relations, and for cooperation between the people of all countries.
    The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party congratulated the Leninist Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for defending the general line and the historical resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
    Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, issued a statement on July 5 expressing support for the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee. He said: We German Communists congratulate the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee, because it is a great contribution to easing international tensions, disarmament and the policy of prohibiting the establishment of atomic war bases in West Germany. He also said that the CPSU Central Committee's removal of the anti-Party group from the Central Committee will be a contribution to the realization of policies that bring happiness to the Soviet people and all mankind, and this is also in line with the interests of peaceful coexistence of all countries with different social systems.
