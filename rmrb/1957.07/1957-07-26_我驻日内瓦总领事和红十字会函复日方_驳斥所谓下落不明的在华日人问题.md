Xinhua News Agency, July 25th. On May 13, 1957, the Japanese government, through its Consul General in Geneva, Shoji Sato, delivered a letter to our Consul General in Geneva, Shen Ping, requesting the Chinese government to investigate the so-called "missing" Japanese in China, along with a roster of 35,767 so-called "non-repatriates." Subsequently, on June 5th and 14th, Hirose Masao, a member of the House of Representatives and Chairman of the House's "Overseas Compatriots Repatriation Committee," sent two telegrams to our Premier Zhou Enlai, requesting permission to lead a delegation to China to negotiate the aforementioned issue, and also copied the telegrams to the Chinese Red Cross, requesting assistance.

Our Consul General in Geneva, Shen Ping, and the Chinese Red Cross have respectively replied on July 25th to the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, Shoji Sato, and the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee Joint Secretariat, sternly refuting the issue of so-called "missing" Japanese in China raised by the Japanese government and Hirose Masao. Simultaneously, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, also briefly replied to Hirose, rejecting his request to visit China, and copied the telegram from the Red Cross Society of China to the three Japanese organizations to Hirose.

The full text of the aforementioned letters and telegrams is as follows:

Shen Ping's Letter to Shoji Sato
Mr. Shoji Sato, Japanese Consul General in Geneva:

I have forwarded the letter you delivered on May 13, 1957, requesting an investigation into the so-called "missing" Japanese in China, to the relevant departments in our country. Now, according to the instructions of our government, I reply as follows, please convey this to the Japanese government.

As everyone knows, despite the fact that China and Japan have not yet restored normal relations, the Chinese government and people, in the spirit of humanitarianism and with the desire to enhance friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, have provided various conveniences and assistance to Japanese nationals in China who wish to return home. Since March 1953, when the Chinese Red Cross, with the consent of the Chinese government, reached an agreement with the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee on assisting Japanese nationals to return home, more than 29,000 of the approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals in China have returned to Japan through the joint efforts of the Chinese Red Cross and the aforementioned three Japanese organizations. Currently, there are still about 6,000 Japanese nationals in our country, all of whom are willing to reside in our country for a long time or temporarily. The Chinese government has also stated many times that if any of them apply to return home in the future, they will continue to receive various conveniences from the Chinese government. During the visit of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan in November 1954, according to the suggestions of the aforementioned three Japanese organizations, both sides reached an agreement on inquiring about the current situation of individual Japanese, in which the Chinese Red Cross expressed its willingness to provide assistance as much as possible. However, all the above agreements have nothing to do with the so-called "missing" Japanese issue raised by the Japanese government. It is very clear that there are no "missing" Japanese in China at all. This has been stated very clearly in the statement of the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 16, 1955, and in my reply to the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, Kageichi Tatsuke, on November 4, 1955. The issue of those Japanese who were driven by the Japanese militarist government to participate in the war of aggression against China and whose whereabouts are unknown is an issue that the Japanese government should explain to the Japanese people.

Now, in order to shirk its responsibility, the Japanese government is unreasonably asking the Chinese government to make an explanation on its behalf, while repeatedly avoiding answering the issue of the tens of thousands of Chinese who were kidnapped to Japan during the Japanese war of aggression, enslaved and killed. This is absolutely unacceptable.

In recent years, with the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people, friendly exchanges between the two sides have continued to develop. We fully understand that there is a growing universal desire among the Japanese people for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. This not only conforms to the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese people, but also contributes to peace in the Far East and the world. To this end, the Chinese government has more than once suggested to the Japanese government that the governments of China and Japan should hold consultations on promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan. However, it is very regrettable that the Japanese government has adopted a completely different attitude towards the issue of normalization of relations between China and Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, during his recent visits to Southeast Asia and the United States, made a series of remarks slandering the People's Republic of China and went to Taiwan to hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the Chinese people. At the same time, the Japanese side has repeatedly raised the so-called "missing" Japanese issue to our government, the purpose of which is obviously to confuse the Japanese people, obstruct and undermine the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, and resist the Japanese people's demand for the normalization of relations between China and Japan. The Chinese government and people will never agree to this attitude and practice of the Japanese government.

Telegram from the Chinese Red Cross to the Three Organizations
Japan Three Organizations Joint Secretariat:

Recently, we received telegrams from Mr. Hirose Masao, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, dated June 5 and 14, 1957, stating that he wanted to lead a delegation in the name of the House of Representatives' Repatriation Committee to visit Beijing for the purpose of negotiating the so-called "missing" Japanese issue. We are deeply surprised to receive the above telegrams after our two sides have already smoothly resolved the issue of the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China.

As is well known, at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the total number of Japanese nationals in China was about 35,000. More than 29,000 of them have been assisted by our society in returning home in the spirit of humanitarianism and enhancing friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in accordance with the 1953 agreement between our two sides. The Japanese nationals currently residing in our country have all expressed their willingness to reside in our country for a long time or temporarily, including former Japanese women who have returned with overseas Chinese as wives of overseas Chinese in recent years. The Chinese Red Cross is still willing to continue to assist those who express their willingness to return to Japan among these people. There is no so-called "missing" Japanese issue in the People's Republic of China.

As for the issue of inquiring about the current situation of individual Japanese that your side has raised in the past, our society is still willing to assist as much as possible in accordance with the spirit of Article 19 of the memorandum of November 3, 1954 between our two sides. If certain aspects in Japan attempt to use this as an excuse to repeatedly raise the so-called "missing" Japanese issue in China, this is absolutely unacceptable. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in a statement on August 16, 1955 that the issue of Japanese who were driven by the Japanese militarist government to participate in the war of aggression against our country and therefore went missing should be explained to the Japanese people by the Japanese government. The Chinese people bear no responsibility for this. However, currently, certain aspects in Japan, under the instigation of the Japanese government, are repeatedly raising the so-called "missing" Japanese issue, which is obviously an attempt to confuse the Japanese people, erase the achievements of our two sides in the past, and especially to erase the efforts of the Chinese Red Cross and the Chinese government to assist Japanese nationals in China to return home in recent years. In addition, it cannot be ignored that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi recently went to Taiwan to hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was spurned by the Chinese people, and made a series of remarks that were consistent with the American tone and hostile to the People's Republic of China. It is not difficult to see from this that the various measures taken by the Japanese government recently are deliberately undermining the increasingly developing friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, and are following the United States to obstruct the realization of the Japanese people's desire to quickly restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. This is not only an extremely unfriendly manifestation to the Chinese people, but also violates the wishes and interests of the Japanese people.

I hereby inform the above situation to your three organizations. Hereby announced, and best regards.

Telegram from Li Dequan to Hirose Masao
Mr. Hirose Masao:

I have received the copies of your two telegrams to Premier Zhou Enlai on June 5th and June 14th. Now I am sending you a copy of the telegram from the Chinese Red Cross to the Japan Three Organizations Joint Secretariat on July 25th. We cannot agree to your request to come to our country in the name of the Japanese "Chairman of the House of Representatives' Repatriation Committee" to negotiate the so-called "missing" Japanese issue, because this issue does not exist, so your request is also unacceptable. I am very sorry that I cannot assist you, sir.

### 我驻日内瓦总领事和红十字会函复日方  驳斥所谓下落不明的在华日人问题

    我驻日内瓦总领事和红十字会函复日方
    驳斥所谓下落不明的在华日人问题
    新华社25日讯　1957年5月13日日本政府通过日本驻日内瓦总领事佐藤正二向我国驻日内瓦总领事沈平交来一封要求中国政府调查在中国的所谓“下落不明”日本人问题的信件和一份载有三万五千七百六十七名所谓“未归国者”的名册。接着在6月5日和14日日本众议院议员广濑正雄又以众议院“海外同胞撤退委员会”委员长的身份两次致电我周恩来总理，要求允许他率领代表团来中国就上述问题进行谈判，并且将来电抄致中国红十字会要求协助。
    我国驻日内瓦总领事沈平和中国红十字会已分别于7月25日函复日本驻日内瓦总领事佐藤正二和日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络委员会三团体联络事务局，对日本政府和广濑正雄提出的在中国有所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题予以严正驳斥。同时，中国红十字会总会李德全会长也简复广濑，拒绝了他来华访问的要求，并且把中国红十字会总会致日本红十字会等三团体的电文抄致广濑。
    上述函件、电报全文如下：
    沈平致佐藤正二的信
    日本驻日内瓦总领事  佐藤正二先生：
    你在1957年5月13日交来的要求调查在中国的所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题的信件，我已转达我国有关方面。现在根据我国政府的指示答复如下，请你转达日本政府。
    众所周知，尽管中日两国还没有恢复正常关系，中国政府和人民本着人道主义精神并且从增进中日两国人民友好的愿望出发，对愿意回国的在华日本侨民，曾经多方给予便利和帮助。自从1953年3月中国红十字会在中国政府同意之下，同日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络委员会就协助日侨回国问题达成协议以来，在总数约三万五千名的在华日侨中，经过中国红十字会和上述日本三团体的共同努力，已有两万九千多名回到了日本。目前在我国的日侨还有六千人左右，他们都是愿意长期或者暂时留居我国的。中国政府还曾经多次表示，如果以后他们中间有人申请回国，他们也将继续得到中国政府给予的各种便利。在1954年11月中国红十字会代表团访问日本期间，还曾经根据上述日本红十字会等三团体的建议，双方就探询个别日本人近况的问题达成一项协议，在协议中中国红十字会表示愿意对此尽量予以协助。但是一切上述协议都同日本政府提出的所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题毫无关系。十分清楚，在中国根本没有什么“下落不明”的日本人。在我国外交部发言人1955年8月16日的声明中和1955年11月4日我以驻日内瓦总领事的名义答复日本驻日内瓦总领事田付景一的信中，都曾经说得非常明白。关于那些被日本军国主义政府驱使参加侵略中国的战争而下落不明的日本人问题，是应该由日本政府向日本人民交代的问题。
    现在日本政府为了推卸责任，竟然毫无道理地要中国政府代它作出交代，而对于中国政府一再提出的在日本侵略战争期间，成千成万的中国人被掳到日本去被奴役和杀害的问题避不答复，这是绝不能容许的。
    近年来在中日两国人民的共同努力下，双方的友好往来有了不断的发展。我们十分了解在日本人民中间存在着日益增长的要求迅速恢复中日邦交的普遍愿望。这不仅符合中日两国人民的共同利益，而且也是有助于远东和世界和平的，为此，中国政府曾经不止一次地向日本政府建议中日两国政府应该就促进中日关系正常化问题进行商谈。但是，十分遗憾，日本政府对中日关系正常化问题却采取同我们完全不同的态度。日本首相岸信介在最近出访东南亚和美国的期间，曾经发表了一系列诋毁中华人民共和国的言论，并且前往台湾，与中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团举行会谈。与此同时，日本方面又一再向我国政府提出所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题，其目的显然是为了混淆日本人民的视听，阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好关系的发展，抵制日本人民对中日关系正常化的要求。日本政府的这种态度和作法，是中国政府和人民所绝不能同意的。

                1957年7月25日
    中国红十字会致三团体的电报日本三团体联络事务局：
    最近我们收到日本众议院议员广濑正雄氏1957年6月5日和14日的电报，声称他要以众议院撤侨委员会名义率领一个代表团，以谈判所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题为目的来访问北京。在贵我双方早已顺利解决在华日本侨民的回国问题之后，竟又接到上述电报，我们深为诧异。
    如所周知，中华人民共和国成立之初，在华日侨总数约有三万五千人左右。其中有二万九千多人已由我会本着人道主义和增进中日两国人民友好的精神根据贵我双方1953年协议，协助回国。目前侨居我国的日侨，都是表示愿意长期或暂时留居我国的，其中包括近几年来作为华侨妻子随同华侨返国的原日籍妇女。这些人中如有表示愿意返回日本的，中国红十字会仍愿继续协助。在中华人民共和国并不存在什么“下落不明”的日本人问题。
    至于贵方过去提出的探询个别日本人近况的问题，我会仍愿根据贵我双方1954年11月3日备忘录第十九条的精神，尽量协助。日本某些方面如果企图以此为借口，一再提出在中国有所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题，这是绝不能容许的。我国外交部发言人在1955年8月16日的声明中就已经指出，关于过去被日本军国主义政府驱使来我国参加侵略战争因而失踪的日本人问题，应该由日本政府向日本人民作出交代。中国人民对此不负任何责任。但是，目前日本某些方面在日本政府的怂恿之下，竟一再提出所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题，这显然是企图混淆日本人民视听，抹煞贵我双方过去的成就，尤其是企图抹煞中国红十字会和中国政府几年来协助在华日侨回国的努力。此外，还不能不注意到最近日本首相岸信介曾经前往台湾同为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团举行会谈，并且发表了一系列同美国腔调一致的敌视中华人民共和国的言论。由此不难看出，日本政府最近所采取的各项措施是蓄意破坏中日两国人民之间日益发展的友好关系，并且追随美国，阻挠日本人民迅速恢复中日邦交的愿望的实现。这不仅是对中国人民极不友好的表现，而且也是违背日本人民的愿望和利益的。
    谨将上述情况通知贵三团体。特此布达，并颂公祺。

    李德全致广漱正雄的电报广濑正雄先生：
    你在6月5日和6月14日致周恩来总理两电的抄件已经收到。现将中国红十字会7月25日致日本三团体联络事务局的电报抄你一份。我们不能同意你以日本“众议院撤侨委员会委员长”名义提出的来我国谈判所谓“下落不明”的日本人问题的要求，因为这个问题是并不存在的，因此你的要求也是不能接受的。很遗憾，我无法协助先生。
