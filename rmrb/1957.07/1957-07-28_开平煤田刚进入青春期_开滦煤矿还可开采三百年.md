Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 26th - The KaiPing Coalfield, where China's first modern mine—Kailuan Coal Mine—was built eighty years ago and put into large-scale mining, has been proven by recent four-plus years of exploration to be just entering its adolescence. According to the proven coalfield reserves, there are more than 3 billion tons. If calculated based on Kailuan Coal Mine's annual output this year, it can continue to be mined for more than 300 years. This coalfield spans the counties of Luanxian and Fengrun in Hebei Province along the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway, spreading vertically and horizontally over 780 square kilometers, more than double the original coalfield area. The coal seam reserves in the Lujiatao, Guogezhuang, and Weishan areas, for which geological reports have already been submitted, are sufficient to build five new pairs of large-scale mines with an annual output of 900,000 to 1.2 million tons.

    开平煤田刚进入青春期
    开滦煤矿还可开采三百年
    据新华社唐山26日电　在八十年前就建设起我国第一座近代化矿井——开滦煤矿进行大规模开采的开平煤田，经过最近四年多的勘探证明才进入它的青春时期。据已查明的煤田储量有三十多亿吨，如以开滦煤矿今年年产量计算，可继续开采三百多年。这个煤田沿京—山铁路横跨在河北省滦县、丰润两县境内，纵横蔓延七百八十多平方公里，比原来的煤田面积扩大了一倍多。仅已提出地质报告书的吕家坨、国各庄、巍山等地区煤层储量，就足够新建五对年产九十万吨到一百二十万吨大型矿井。
