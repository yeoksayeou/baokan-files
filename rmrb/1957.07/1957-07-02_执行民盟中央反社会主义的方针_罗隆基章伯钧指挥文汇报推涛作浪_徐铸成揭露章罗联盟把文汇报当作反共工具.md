Implementing the Anti-Socialist Policies of the China Democratic League Central Committee
Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun Direct Wenhui Daily to Stir Up Trouble
Xu Zhucheng Exposes the Zhang-Luo Alliance for Using Wenhui Daily as an Anti-Communist Tool

In his speech, Xu Zhucheng exposed the facts of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji using Wenhui Daily. In this speech, he began to admit that Luo Longji, through Pu Xixiu and himself, used Wenhui Daily as a propaganda tool against the leadership of the Party and against socialism, and exposed some facts.

Xu Zhucheng said that they used my bourgeois newspaper management ideology to constantly instill in us the idea of opposing the leadership of the Party and opposing socialism, and used Pu Xixiu to influence and utilize Wenhui Daily.

Xu Zhucheng said: In 1948, when I went to Hong Kong from Shanghai to run Wenhui Daily, Luo instructed me that the newspaper's attitude should not be too left-leaning, should be more detached, and should not be too close to the Communist Party.

Xu Zhucheng said that after liberation, Pu Xixiu joined Wenhui Daily. Luo Longji repeatedly told me that Pu Xixiu was willing to work at Wenhui Daily because of his relationship, as if he should have special privileges for Wenhui Daily from then on. Over the years, in addition to influencing and utilizing me when he met with me, Luo Longji mainly expressed his opinions on Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu.

After Wenhui Daily was relaunched last year, I met with Luo Longji for the first time in April. He said to me: "Since you are the editor-in-chief, you should take responsibility and not accommodate Party members. Your attitude of accommodation is liberalism." In addition, he repeatedly said that day that the People's Daily editorials are not all correct, and don't be superstitious about the People's Daily. Don't be superstitious about Party members, the level of Marxism-Leninism of Party members is not necessarily higher than ours. He knew that I had bourgeois journalistic views, so he implied that I should not believe in the leadership of the Party, that I could act arbitrarily in the unit, and not obey the opinions of the Party group. He also said that in terms of speech, we could sing a different tune from the People's Daily, and that if we wanted to understand the central government's intentions and reflect opinions to the central government, we could find him. In short, he wanted me to lean towards him instead of leaning towards the Party.

The second time I talked to Luo Longji was in mid-June last year, when I asked him about the relaunch of Wenhui Daily. He repeatedly said that the relaunch of Wenhui Daily was something they had called for, and he implied that the central government did not truly cherish and support Wenhui Daily, and that only he truly cared about Wenhui Daily.

Later, we saw him twice more.

He advocated that we publish in Beijing, because the central government's policies change when they reach the local level, and it is not easy to do things in Shanghai. He also suggested that we first launch a discussion on the issue of language reform at the beginning of the relaunch. He also said that the issue of the anti-hidden counter-revolutionaries work was a big problem. We tried to get the specific leadership of the Ministry of Culture, and Luo Longji said to Pu Xixiu: Aren't you tired of wearing the "iron hat" of the official newspaper? At that time, he already knew that Wenhui Daily had decided to publish in Shanghai, so he said to us that if we had any difficulties, we could find him to reflect them to the central government.

At the end of August last year, in order to solicit opinions on the relaunch of Wenhui Daily, we held a forum for democratic personages at Luo Longji's home. The people invited were Chen Shutong, Ye Shengtao, Zheng Zhenduo, Deng Chumin, Chen Shaoxian, etc. Seeing Deng Chumin and Chen Shaoxian in attendance, Luo Longji was very unhappy, saying that with these two dogmatists present, it would be difficult to talk. Later, Pu Xixiu sent Deng Chumin away, and Ye Shengtao also left. Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, and others then "spoke freely." They all said that Party members were incompetent, and spoke with ridicule about some comrades who wanted to join the Party and the League. Zhang Naiqi also said, "I will never join the Party in my life."

After Luo Longji made fallacious remarks at the United Front Work Department forum on May 10, he called the Beijing office of Wenhui Daily that night. After learning that the office had not sent the news of the forum to Shanghai, he sternly said: "It's a pity that you journalists didn't pay attention to such an important forum!"

Wenhui Daily has always been warmly supported by progressive elements. Because Luo Longji called all progressive people who leaned towards the Party dogmatists, Pu Xixiu, under the influence of Luo Longji, narrowed the scope of soliciting manuscripts, limiting the objects to Wu Jingchao, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, etc., and expressed unwelcome to the manuscripts of Wu Han, Shi Liang, Deng Chumin, etc. Therefore, in the past period, Wenhui Daily almost became a forum for right-wing elements. In the past period, the editorial department of Wenhui Daily originally hoped to understand the political climate of the capital in a timely manner through the Beijing office, but as a result, what it understood was often the right-wing climate blowing from Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun.

Luo Longji repeatedly said that he and Zhang Bojun were not together, but the facts prove that at least they were consistent in engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, and they were also consistent in wanting to pull Wenhui Daily out of the leadership of the Party and make it their tool for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. I met Zhang Bojun several times last year, and Zhang Bojun also told me that running a newspaper should have its own opinions and should publish more news that the Party newspapers have not published. Regarding Wenhui Daily after its relaunch, he also repeatedly said that it should reflect the distress of intellectuals more and discuss specific work and policy issues more. He also advocated that the issue of language reform could be launched first in Wenhui Daily. Obviously, they all knew that the issue of language reform could most touch the widespread attention of intellectuals and most provoke the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of intellectuals with the Party. During Luo Longji's trip abroad, Comrade Pu Xixiu would call Zhang Bojun if anything happened, which shows that Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun were consistent on how to use Wenhui Daily.

When the National People's Congress was in session last year, Zhang Bojun handed me a note, asking me, Zhao Chaogou, Chu Anping, and Xiao Qian to have dinner with him the next day. Zhao Chaogou didn't go the next day. Zhang Bojun's conversation that day left me with a few deep impressions: He said that international news should be divided, with Party newspapers publishing more news about socialist countries, and non-Party newspapers should publish more news about capitalist countries; local news should also be different. For example, today all the newspapers published Vice Premier Chen Yun spending the weekend with financial and economic cadres. I also attended the Ministry of Communications' evening party yesterday. Why not publish Minister Zhang spending the weekend with Ministry of Communications cadres? It can be seen that his idea of "dividing the court and resisting courtesy" with the Communist Party has long existed; he said that one day he would like to invite Wang Yunsheng to talk together, and in the future, Dagong Daily, Guangming Daily, and Wenhui Daily, several non-Party newspapers, can adopt a consistent attitude on issues such as newspapers and circulation quotas. This issue was not discussed later, but Zhang Bojun said these words deliberately to try to grab a few non-Party newspapers through these methods.

Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji both wanted to seize newspapers as their political capital, and Wenhui Daily was dragged onto the road of right-wing newspapers by them.

After exposing a series of facts about Luo Longji controlling Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu, Xu Zhucheng asked Pu Xixiu to examine and expose the facts of how Luo Longji used Wenhui Daily through the Beijing office of Wenhui Daily, and asked Pu Xixiu to quickly draw a clear line with Luo Longji and expose Luo Longji's political conspiracy.

    执行民盟中央反社会主义的方针
    罗隆基章伯钧指挥文汇报推涛作浪
    徐铸成揭露章罗联盟把文汇报当作反共工具
    徐铸成在发言中揭露章伯钧、罗隆基利用文汇报的事实，在这次发言中他开始承认罗隆基通过浦熙修和他利用文汇报作为反对党的领导反对社会主义的宣传工具，并且揭发一些事实。
    徐铸成说，他们是利用我的资产阶级办报思想，不断对我们贯输反对党的领导反对社会主义的思想，并且利用浦熙修来影响和利用文汇报。
    徐铸成说：1948年我从上海到香港去办文汇报的时候罗就指点我报纸的态度不要太左，要超然一点，不要和共产党太接近。
    徐铸成说，解放以后，浦熙修参加了文汇报，罗隆基一再对我表示，浦熙修所以肯在文汇报工作，是因为他的关系，好像他从此以后，对文汇报就应该有特权。几年来罗隆基除掉和我见面时影响我、利用我以外，主要就是通过浦熙修表示他对文汇报的意见。
    去年文汇报复刊后，4月间我和罗隆基第一次见面，他对我说：“你既然是总编辑，就该负起责任来，不要迁就党员，你这样迁就的态度是自由主义。”除此之外，他那天还反复谈到，人民日报的社论不都是正确的，不要迷信人民日报。不要迷信党员，党员马列主义水平不一定比我们高。他知道我有资产阶级新闻观点，因此就暗示我不要相信党的领导，在单位里可以独断专行，不要服从党组的意见。他还说，在言论上可以和人民日报唱对台戏，要了解中央意图，要向中央反映意见，都可以找他。总之，要我靠拢他，而不靠拢党。
    第二次和罗隆基谈话是去年6月中，找他打听文汇报的复刊问题。他一再表示文汇报的复刊是他们叫出来的，他暗示中央对文汇报并不真正爱护和支持，只有他才真正关心文汇报。
    以后，我们又见过他两次。
    他主张我们在北京出版，因为中央的政策到地方就走样了，在上海不好办。他还建议我们在复刊之初首先展开文字改革问题的讨论。他还说肃反工作问题很大。我们曾争取文化部的具体领导，罗隆基就对浦熙修说：机关报的“铁帽子”，你们戴得还没有够吗？当时他已经知道文汇报决定在上海出版了，就向我们说，有困难可以找他向中央反映。
    去年8月底，我们为了征求对文汇报复刊的意见，有一次在罗隆基家里请民主人士座谈，请的人有陈叔通、叶圣陶、郑振铎、邓初民、陈劭先等，看到有邓初民和陈劭先在座，罗隆基很不高兴，说有这两位教条主义者在座，就不好谈了。后来浦熙修把邓初民支使走了，叶圣陶也走了。罗隆基、章伯钧、章乃器等就“畅所欲言”了，他们尽说党员无能，并以讥笑的口吻谈有些要求入党入团的同志。章乃器还说“我是一辈子不入党的。”
    罗隆基5月10日在统战部座谈会上发表谬论后，当晚曾打电话给文汇报北京办事处，在他得知办事处没有把座谈会的消息发到上海以后，严厉地说：“这样重要的座谈会你们新闻记者不注意，可惜了！”
    文汇报一向受到进步分子的热烈支持，因为罗隆基把进步的靠拢党的人都说是教条主义，浦熙修在罗隆基的影响下，约稿的范围就越来越狭小，对象限于吴景超、潘光旦、费孝通等，对吴晗、史良、邓初民等的稿件表示不欢迎。所以，在过去一个时期，文汇报几乎成为右派分子的讲坛。在过去一个时期，文汇报编辑部原希望通过北京办事处及时了解首都的政治气候，结果了解的往往是从罗隆基、章伯钧那里吹来的右派气候。
    罗隆基一再说他和章伯钧不是一起的，但事实证明，至少他们在搞反党反社会主义的活动上是一致的，想把文汇报从党的领导下拉出来，做他们反党反社会主义的工具也是一致的。我去年和章伯钧见过几次面，章伯钧也对我说办报要有自己的主张，要多登党报没有登的消息。对复刊后的文汇报，他也一再说应该多反映知识分子的苦闷，多讨论具体工作和政策问题，他也主张文字改革问题可以首先在文汇报展开讨论。很明显，他们都知道文字改革问题最能打动知识分子的广泛注意，最能挑拨广大知识分子对党的不满。在罗隆基出国期间，浦熙修同志有事就给章伯钧打电话，可见在如何利用文汇报上罗隆基和章伯钧是一致的。
    去年人民代表大会开会时，章伯钧递条子给我，要我和赵超构、储安平、萧乾第二天到他那里吃饭。第二天赵超构没去。章伯钧那天的谈话，有几点给我的印象很深：他说，国际新闻应该分工，党报多登社会主义国家的新闻，非党报应多登资本主义国家的消息；本市新闻也不要一样。比如，今天各报都登陈云副总理和财经干部共度周末，我昨天也参加了交通部的晚会，为什么不登章部长和交通部干部共度周末呢？可见他要和共产党
  “分庭抗礼”的思想早就有了；他说，哪一天他想约王芸生来一起谈谈，今后大公报、光明日报、文汇报几家非党报纸在报纸和发行定额等问题上可以采取一致的态度。以后这问题并没有谈，但章伯钧说这些话是蓄意想通过这些手法来抓几家党外报纸。
    章伯钧、罗隆基都想抓报纸作为他们的政治资本，文汇报就被他们拉上了右派报纸的道路。
    徐铸成在揭发了罗隆基通过浦熙修控制文汇报的一系列的事实后，要求浦熙修检查揭发罗隆基如何通过文汇报北京办事处利用文汇报的事实，要求浦熙修赶快和罗隆基划清界限，揭露罗隆基的政治阴谋。
