Rapid Development of Hog Raising in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Pork Supply Eases
    Wangcheng County, Hunan, Averages Over Seven Hogs Per Household

    (Our Newspaper) According to statistics from the end of June, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had over 14.58 million hogs, surpassing the highest level in history. Due to the increase in hogs, the market pork supply has eased. In Nanjing and Hangzhou, the average daily pork supply exceeds 1,000 heads.

    Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have implemented the "private ownership, private raising, public assistance" hog raising policy according to the central government's spirit, and have universally adjusted hog purchasing prices in various regions, with manure also discounted, thereby greatly increasing farmers' enthusiasm for hog raising. On average, each household raises one hog.

    Recently, the two provinces, based on the characteristics of plains, mountainous areas, and semi-mountainous areas, have planned feed bases, assigned to members to cultivate themselves. Farmers in the two provinces have also discovered and cultivated various juicy green fodders, with dried grass seeds ground into powder, whose nutritional value exceeds corn.

    Relevant departments have calculated that the existing hogs in the two provinces increase farmers' income by over 650 million yuan, while also solving the fertilizer needs of nearly 30 million mu of cultivated land.

    (Our Newspaper) As of the end of April, Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, had 359,500 hogs (an average of over seven hogs per household), accounting for 67.84% of the annual planned figure of 530,000 heads. This achievement is inseparable from the local party and government organs' proactive efforts to resolve the difficulties of some hog-raising households.

    These difficulties are: first, lack of funds; second, lack of pigsties; third, lack of piglets. In response to the above situation, the county party committee put forward the slogan "Tap potential, eliminate empty pigsties," and adopted the following methods respectively: The commune lends piglets or medium-sized pigs to members for private raising, fattening, and resale, with repayment of the principal afterward, or in installments, or by mobilizing members to lend to each other with repayment of principal and interest; the commune's publicly owned pigs are handed over to members for foster care, with foster households earning work points; members are organized to purchase and raise their own. Through these measures, more than 19,000 empty-pigsty households were reduced in the first quarter of this year, accounting for 62% of the total empty-pigsty households, and nearly 2,000 of the county's more than 4,000 "Five Guarantees" households also raised pigs. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the phenomenon of empty pigsties in the county can be completely eliminated.

    Farmers originally had many concerns about the government's call to raise hogs in large quantities. For example, they feared that the income from raising pigs would be forcibly invested by the commune, so it was better to engage in other sideline businesses to earn cash to solve livelihood difficulties; some believed that raising pigs was both laborious and did not generate much income, so it was better to do farm work to earn work points; some "Five Guarantees" households believed that even if they did not raise pigs, the commune would not let them go hungry; some households feared feed difficulties. These ideological concerns have generally been resolved through propaganda and explanation of policies.

    In order to solve the hog-raising difficulties of struggling households and "Five Guarantees" households, the county also issued 550,000 yuan in advance purchase deposits this year, and vigorously promoted the overproduction reward system. Therefore, the county's plan to raise 530,000 hogs this year can be completed.

### 江浙生猪发展迅速  猪肉供应已趋缓和  湖南望城县平均每户养猪已达七头多

    江浙生猪发展迅速  猪肉供应已趋缓和
    湖南望城县平均每户养猪已达七头多
    本报讯  据6月底统计，江苏、浙江两省生猪已达一千四百五十八万多头，超过历史上的最高水平。由于生猪增多，市场猪肉供应已趋缓和。南京、杭州两市，猪肉平均日供千头以上。
    江、浙两省根据中央精神贯彻了“私有、私养、公助”的养猪方针，并在各地普遍地调整了生猪的收购价格，厩肥也折价，因此农民养猪的积极性很高。平均每户养一头猪。
    最近两省根据平原、山区、半山区不同地区特点，规划了饲料基地，交由社员自己种植。两省农民还发掘和培育了多种多汁青饲料，晒干的草籽碾成粉，营养价值超过玉米。
    有关部门计算，两省现有生猪，使农民增加六亿五千多万元的收入，同时解决了近三千万亩耕地的肥料。
    本报讯  湖南省望城县截至4月底统计，全县养猪三十五万九千五百多头（每户平均养猪七头多），为全年计划数五十三万头的67.84％。这一成绩和当地党政机关主动解决一些养猪户的困难是分不开的。
    这些困难是：一、缺资金；二、没有猪栏；三、缺猪秧。针对以上情况，县委提出了“挖掘潜力，消灭空栏”的口号，分别采取下述办法：由社贷给小猪或中猪，由社员私养，育肥出售后再还本，或分期付款，或发动社员互相间借贷以后还本付息；将社的公有猪交社员代养，代养户可收入工分；组织社员自己购养。通过这些措施，到今年第一季度就减少空栏户一万九千多户，占总空栏户62％，全县四千多户五保户，也有近二千户养了猪。估计到年底，全县空栏现象可以完全消灭。
    农民对政府号召大量养猪，思想上原来存在许多顾虑。例如怕养猪的收入，社里强迫投资，因此不如搞其他副业赚点现钱解决生活困难；有的认为养猪既劳累而收入不大，不如干庄稼活挣工分；有些五保户认为自己不养猪，社里也不能让饿肚子，有些户怕饲料困难。这些思想顾虑，通过宣传和交代政策，一般都得到解决。
    为了解决困难户和五保户养猪困难，今年全县还发放了预购定金五十五万元，还大力推行了超产奖励制度。因此今年全县养猪五十三万头的计划是可以完成的。
