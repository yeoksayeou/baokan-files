Chu Anping said at the Jiangsu Province representative group meeting today that when he discussed with Luo Longji about democratic parties helping the Communist Party to rectify its work style, he mentioned the "old monk" and "young monk" matter and asked Luo Longji, "Regarding the issue of the twelve vice premiers, can we talk about it?" Luo Longji replied, "We can talk about it." According to Chu Anping, Luo Longji also talked to him about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and other issues.

Chu Anping also said today that Zhang Bojun had spoken to him twice. Zhang Bojun wanted Guangming Daily to publish more news about people. Zhang Bojun said, "Now everything is concentrated on a few people, and in the newspapers, we only see the names of a few people. Such a large country, concentrating things on a few people, how can it be done well!"

Chu Anping tried his best to avoid his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance today. He only said, "Our thoughts and positions have a common foundation." Some representatives asked him to examine the errors of his "Party's World" speech, questioned him why he sent people to ignite fires in nine major cities, and why he tampered with the political direction of Guangming Daily. Chu Anping avoided answering. The representatives expressed their indignation at Chu Anping's attitude.

Today, Luo Longji did not attend the group meeting, and Zhang Bojun did not speak at the Anhui Province group meeting.

    储安平承认他的发言曾和罗隆基商量过但仍然竭力避开他跟章罗同盟的关系
    储安平今天在江苏省代表小组会上说，他跟罗隆基谈民主党派帮助共产党整风时，曾经提起“老和尚”与“小和尚”一事，问罗隆基：“关于十二个副总理问题，是否可以谈谈？”罗隆基回答：“可以谈。” 罗隆基还对储安平说：“这次全国人民代表大会会议之后，对于政治制度可能引起讨论。”据储安平说，罗隆基还跟他谈了肃反等问题。
    储安平今天还说，章伯钧曾经跟他谈过两次话。章伯钧要光明日报多登人的新闻。章伯钧说：“现在什么事情都集中在几个人身上，在报纸上也只看到几个人的名字。这样大的国家，把事情集中在几个人身上，怎么办得好！”
    储安平今天竭力避开他跟章罗同盟的关系，他只说“我们的思想和立场有共同的基础”。有些代表要他检查“党天下”发言的错误，质问他为什么要派人到九大城市点火，为什么要篡改光明日报的政治方向，储安平避而不答。代表们对储安平的这种态度表示愤慨。
    今天罗隆基没有出席小组会，章伯钧在安徽省小组会上没有发言。
