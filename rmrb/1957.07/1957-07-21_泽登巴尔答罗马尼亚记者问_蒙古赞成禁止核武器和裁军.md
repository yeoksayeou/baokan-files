Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 20th - Romanian central newspapers published on the 19th the answers of Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, to questions from a Romanian News Agency reporter.

Tsedenbal spoke about certain current international issues, saying that testing thermonuclear weapons is dangerous for any region in the world. The socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, advocate the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons. The Mongolian government and people fully support the attitude of the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries on this issue. We support the immediate prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the prohibition of testing such weapons, and disarmament.

When talking about the measures that must be taken to consolidate peace in Asia, Tsedenbal said, "I believe that the main conditions for consolidating peace in Asia (and not only for Asia) are the dissolution of military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, the removal of military bases on foreign territories, the withdrawal of foreign troops from all countries, the abolition of illegal treaties signed between Western countries and Asian countries, the strengthening of the Bandung Principles, the expansion of comprehensive cooperation between Asian countries, and the struggle for peace and friendship between all peoples."

When discussing the prospects for the development of relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and Japan, Tsedenbal said that Mongolia is willing to conclude a peace treaty with Japan and establish diplomatic and other relations. However, until now, we have not seen Japan take any concrete steps in this regard. This is easily explained when considering that the Japanese government is currently heavily reliant on the United States, because the United States is obstructing Japan from establishing friendly relations with other Asian countries. Progressive people in Japan are working hard to normalize relations between Japan and the Mongolian People's Republic. Tsedenbal finally said that our relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries are becoming increasingly consolidated. We have long established very close economic and cultural relations with the Soviet Union. Our people associate all the achievements of our republic with the assistance we receive from the Soviet Union.

    蒙古赞成禁止核武器和裁军
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚中央各报19日刊载了蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔答罗马尼亚通讯社记者问。
    泽登巴尔谈到了某些当前的国际问题，他说，试验热核武器对世界上任何一个地区都是危险的。以苏联为首的各个社会主义国家都主张禁止原子武器和热核武器。蒙古政府和人民完全支持苏联和社会主义阵营各国对这个问题的态度。我们拥护立即禁止大规模毁灭性武器，拥护禁止试验这种武器，拥护裁军。
    在谈到为巩固亚洲和平所必须采取的措施时，泽登巴尔说，我认为，巩固亚洲和平的主要条件（也不仅仅是对亚洲），是解散像东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约这样一些军事集团，撤除在别国领土上的军事基地，从各国撤退外国军队，废除西方国家和亚洲各国签订的不合法的条约，加强万隆原则，扩大亚洲国家的全面合作以及为争取和平和各国人民之间的友谊而奋斗。
    泽登巴尔在谈到蒙古人民共和国同日本关系的发展前途时说，蒙古愿意同日本缔结和约，建立外交和其他方面的关系。但是直到现在，我们并没有看到日本在这方面采取任何具体步骤。如果考虑到日本政府目前是处在十分依靠美国的情况下，这就容易解释了，因为美国阻挠日本同亚洲其他国家建立友好关系。日本的进步人士正在努力使日本同蒙古人民共和国的关系正常化。泽登巴尔最后说，我们同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的关系日益巩固。我们和苏联早就建立了非常密切的经济和文化关系。我国人民把我们共和国的一切成就同苏联对我们的援助联系在一起。
