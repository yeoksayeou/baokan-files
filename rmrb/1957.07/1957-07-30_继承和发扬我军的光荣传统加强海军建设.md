Inherit and Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition of Our Army and Strengthen Naval Construction
Zhou Xihan, Lieutenant General of the People's Liberation Army Navy

The People's Liberation Army has been established for a full thirty years. During these thirty years, the People's Liberation Army has experienced setbacks, suffered defeats, and traveled a tortuous and arduous road. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the full support of the people, the successive sacrifices of millions of martyrs, and the arduous struggle of the entire army, it finally overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and won a nationwide victory. After the victory, it immediately threw itself into the struggle to suppress bandits, eliminate special agents, defend the borders, defend the coast, and safeguard socialist construction. In the struggle, the People's Liberation Army has grown into a modern composite army that enjoys worldwide fame.

The Navy is the youngest in this modern composite army. It was only eight years ago, when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River to pursue and wipe out the Kuomintang remnants, that the Navy began to be established.

Our country has vast and rich territorial waters. Since ancient times, the production and life of our people have been closely related to the ocean. However, in the past hundred years, due to the opening of our country's sea gates, most of the imperialist aggression against our country came from the sea. The people of our country have clearly realized from historical experience that sea defense is an important part of national defense. Without a strong sea defense force, there is no solid national defense. Therefore, they urgently hope to build a naval combat force that can defend against imperialist aggression from the sea. In 1949, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "We must build a navy, a navy that can defend our sea defense and effectively defend against possible imperialist aggression." This expresses the wishes of the people of the whole country and is what the people of the whole country are looking forward to day and night.

The Navy was built on the basis of the People's Liberation Army Army. The army units and a large number of cadres who have been tempered by long-term revolutionary wars have rich experience in training troops, commanding operations, and political work, and have a glorious tradition tested by long-term revolutionary wars. The Navy is built on the solid foundation of the People's Liberation Army Army, and its conditions are excellent. This enables the Navy to avoid at least taking detours in its construction, and to carry out construction smoothly in accordance with the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army.

Fighting while building is the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, and it is also a characteristic of naval construction. As soon as the Navy was established, it actively cooperated with other services and arms to carry out combat tasks such as defending the coast, liberating coastal islands, and escorting and protecting fishing. In the past eight years, the naval forces have closely cooperated with other brotherly units to liberate the Zhoushan Islands, the Wanshan Islands, the Dongji Islands, and the Taizhou Islands, and have controlled all sea areas except those around Taiwan, compressing the enemy's harassing activities along the coast to the vicinity of the isolated islands of Matsu and Kinmen. While performing these combat missions, it also protected millions of fishermen to carry out fishery production safely, and protected thousands of merchant ships to sail safely. The naval forces also regard supporting the country's socialist construction as their central task. Therefore, in addition to combat activities such as escorting and protecting fishing, they also actively carry out tasks such as transporting grain, providing disaster relief, preventing floods, and rescuing dangers at any time and anywhere. Through the implementation of these tasks, the love of the navy personnel for the ocean has been enhanced, and their ability to adapt to the marine environment has been tempered; the combination of training and actual combat has been strengthened, and the military quality of the navy has been improved. The Navy is "building while fighting" in this way. Although there are many difficulties, the process of overcoming difficulties is also the process of the Navy's rapid growth.

The Navy is a multi-service arm with complex technical equipment. Building such a technical arm, the things that were familiar in the past are obviously not enough, and many completely unfamiliar things must be learned quickly. The naval personnel inherited the glorious tradition of hard study of the People's Liberation Army, gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and diligently carried out research on modern naval technology. In the past eight years, a large number of advanced figures have emerged in troop training and technical learning, and there have also been a large number of innovations and creations in business technology. Many cadres who had never seen the ocean have now become captains who can flexibly maneuver ships in stormy waves; many old soldiers who were only familiar with writing have now mastered the technical equipment in their hands proficiently. If compared with the speed of capitalist countries in training naval talents, we are far ahead. What they can do in ten or twenty years, we have done in a few years.

The Navy, like other services and arms of the People's Liberation Army, has also developed from nothing, from small to large, and from weak to strong. When the Navy was first established, it only had some dilapidated ships and a few coastal defense troops. Eight years later, the Navy has built up a considerable scale of ship units, aviation units, air defense units, and coastal defense units. On many originally deserted islands, naval personnel also leveled thorns, opened roads, built positions, and cultivated flower gardens, making them strong combat fortresses and happy homes for soldiers. Now we can proudly say: Our country's sea defense combat system has been established. Our country not only has "sea," but also has "defense." The era of open sea gates and no sea defense is gone forever.

Marshal Peng Dehuai's assessment of the modernization of our army is completely correct. He said: "Although the modernization of our army has not been long, and the various services and arms have not yet reached a completely modern level, they have reached an unprecedented scale in our country" (Speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China). The current situation of naval construction is exactly like this. Whether in terms of the scale of this navy, its existing technical equipment, and the proficiency of all personnel in the equipment in their hands, or in terms of the combat power that has grown up, the navy of any period in our country's history cannot compare with it.

The fundamental reason why the Navy has achieved such achievements in the past eight years is the Party's infinite concern and correct leadership for the naval construction cause. The support of the people, the assistance of brotherly services and arms, the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in engaging in the naval construction cause, and the widespread dissemination of advanced Soviet experience are certainly the basic factors for the achievements of naval construction; but all these factors can only play a full role under the correct leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, naval construction could not only not achieve achievements, but it would not be possible for a people's navy to emerge at all.

Affirming the achievements of the naval construction cause does not mean that our work has no shortcomings. There are many shortcomings, and some are quite serious. Therefore, we must make redoubled efforts in the future to overcome shortcomings, better carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, and further strengthen naval construction.

First of all, we must strengthen the absolute leadership of the Party over the Navy. The Party's leadership is the soul of the people's army. Without the Party's leadership, the life of the people's army will die. The ambitious right-wing elements see this very clearly, so they try to remove the Party's leadership from the people's army. Their intentions are indeed extremely vicious, but they are in vain. Because the entire members of the Navy with a high degree of class consciousness deeply understand that the Party's leadership over the people's army is absolutely necessary. Without the Party, there would be no people's army. Therefore, they resolutely counterattacked the right-wing elements, not only exposing the ugly faces of the right-wing elements with incomparable indignation, but also loving the Party more and supporting the Party's leadership more. The right-wing elements originally wanted to weaken the Party's leadership over the people's army, but now it has backfired. This is probably beyond their expectations!

Secondly, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times and strictly prevent the enemy from harassing and sabotaging our country's socialist cause. The naval forces are located on the front line of sea defense and should establish a strict combat readiness system, strengthen maritime and air patrols and vigilance, effectively prevent enemy sneak attacks and sabotage, protect the safety of navigation channels and fishery production, and defend the country's socialist construction.

The real strengthening of combat readiness depends on arduous and intensive training. According to the needs of actual combat, it is particularly important to strengthen officer training and strengthen training under complex conditions. If we do not quickly train more officers with modern naval warfare command skills, and do not train the troops to have the ability to fight under any complex conditions, we will not be able to win the battle. From the perspective of the future of naval construction, strengthening training is also very necessary. Naval technology is developing rapidly with each passing day. If we do not speed up our pace to catch up with the development of naval technology, we will fall behind, and falling behind will inevitably lead to beatings.

The people of our country are brave, hardworking, and talented. With the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, such people will surely be able to wash away all the backward traces left over from the old society with their own hands and stand tall in the ranks of the most advanced in the world. Now, warmly celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, all naval personnel are jubilant and full of confidence. Relying on the leadership of the Party, relying on the support of the people, and relying on the glorious tradition created by the People's Liberation Army's 30 years of arduous struggle, naval construction will be rapidly strengthened, and a strong naval combat force will effectively defend our country's sea defense.

    继承和发扬我军的光荣传统加强海军建设
    中国人民解放军海军中将　周希汉
    人民解放军建军整整三十年了。三十年间，人民解放军经历过挫折，遭受过失败，走过了一条曲折的、艰险的道路。可是由于共产党的正确领导，由于人民群众全力支援，由于千百万先烈前仆后继和全军上下艰苦奋战，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，赢得了全国性的胜利。胜利以后，又立即投入了剿匪、肃特、保卫边防、保卫海防等等保卫社会主义建设的斗争。人民解放军在斗争中已成长为一支在全世界享有威名的现代化合成军队了。
    海军在这支现代化合成军队里年纪最轻。八年以前，当人民解放军横渡长江追歼国民党残余的时候，海军才开始建立。
    我国的海疆辽阔富饶，自古以来，我国人民的生产和生活就和海洋有着密切的联系。可是，近百年来由于我国海上的门户洞开，因而帝国主义对我国的侵略多数来自海上。我国人民从历史经验中清楚地认识到：海防是国防的重要组成部分，没有强大的海防力量，就没有巩固的国防，因而迫切希望建设一支能够防御帝国主义从海上侵略我国的海军战斗力量。毛主席于1949年明确指出：“我们一定要建设一支海军，这支海军要能保卫我们的海防，有效地防御帝国主义的可能的侵略”。这正表达了全国人民的心愿，正是全国人民所日夜期望的。
    海军是以人民解放军陆军为基础建设起来的。经过长期革命战争锻炼的陆军部队和大批干部，有训练部队、作战指挥和政治工作的丰富经验，有为长期革命战争考验过的光荣传统。海军建立在人民解放军陆军这个牢固的基础上，其条件是再优越也没有了。这使得海军在建设中可以不走至少是少走弯路，可以遵照人民解放军的光荣传统顺利地进行建设。
    一边战斗、一边建设是人民解放军建军的光荣传统，也是海军建设的特点。海军一建立，就积极配合其他军种、兵种执行了保卫海防、解放沿海岛屿和护航护渔等项战斗任务。八年多来，海军部队和其他兄弟部队密切配合，解放了舟山群岛、万山群岛、东矶列岛和台州列岛，控制了除台湾周围以外的所有海区，把敌人在沿海的骚扰活动压缩在马祖、金门几个孤岛的附近。与执行这些战斗任务的同时，还保护数百万渔民群众安全地进行了渔业生产，保护了数千艘商船安全地航行。海军部队还把支援国家社会主义建设作为自己的中心任务，因此，除了护航、护渔等战斗活动以外，还随时随地积极地执行运粮、救灾、防汛、抢险各项任务。通过对这些任务的执行，增强了海军人员对于海洋的热爱，锻炼了他们适应海洋环境的能力；密切了训练和实战的结合，提高了海军的军事素质。海军这样“边打边建”，困难固然是很多的，可是克服困难的过程，也正是海军迅速成长的过程。
    海军是个多兵种的军种，技术装备复杂。建设这样一个技术军种，过去熟悉的东西显然是不够用了，而许多完全生疏的东西，却非很快学到手不可。海军人员继承人民解放军艰苦学习的光荣传统，高度地发挥了积极性和创造性，刻苦地进行了对于现代海军技术的钻研。八年多来，在部队训练、技术学习中涌现出了大批先进人物，在业务技术方面也有大量的革新和创造。许多从未见过海洋的干部，如今成了能在狂风骇浪中灵活操纵舰只的舰长；许多原来只是粗通文字的老战士，如今熟练地掌握了手中的技术装备。如果和资本主义国家培养海军人材的速度相比较，我们是远远地走在了前面，他们十年二十年才能办到的事情，我们在几年中间就办到了。
    海军和人民解放军其他军种、兵种一样，也是由无到有，由小到大，由弱到强发展起来的。海军初建时，只有一些残旧的舰艇和少数岸防部队。八年后的现在，海军已经建设起来具有相当规模的舰艇部队、航空兵部队、防空部队和海岸防御部队。在许多原来是荒无人烟的岛屿上，海军人员还铲平荆棘、开辟道路，筑起阵地，培起花圃，使它们成为战斗的坚强堡垒，战士们的快乐家园。现在可以自豪地说：我国的海防作战体系已经建立起来了，我国不只有“海”，而且有“防”，海上门户洞开、有海无防的时代已一去不复返了。
    彭德怀元帅对于我军现代化建设所作的估价是完全正确的。他说：“虽然由于我军现代化建设为时不久，各军种、兵种还未能达到完全现代化的程度，但是已经达到我国空前未有的规模”
  （在中共八大会上的发言）。海军建设的现状正是这样。无论就这支海军的规模、它现有的技术装备和全体人员对于手中装备的熟练程度来说，或者就它已经成长起来的战斗力量来说，我国历史上任何时期的海军，都是不能望其项背的。
    海军在过去的八年间所以能取得这样的成就，根本原因是党对海军建设事业的无限关怀和正确领导。人民群众的支援，兄弟军种、兵种的帮助，广大官兵从事海军建设事业的热情和积极性，以及苏联先进经验的广泛传播，固然都是海军建设取得成就的基本因素；但是所有这些因素，也都是在党的正确领导下才充分发挥作用的。如果没有共产党的领导，海军建设不仅不可能取得成就，而且根本不可能出现一支人民的海军。
    肯定海军建设事业的成就，并不等于说我们的工作已经做得没有缺点了。缺点是不少的，有一些还比较严重。因此，今后必须加倍努力，克服缺点，更好地发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，进一步加强海军建设。
    首先必须加强党对海军的绝对领导。党的领导是人民军队的灵魂，离开党的领导人民军队的生命便将死亡。野心勃勃的右派分子对于这一点是看得很透的，所以他们才企图把党的领导从人民军队里撤销。其用心诚然极其恶毒，但是却枉费心机。因为具有高度阶级觉悟的海军全体成员深深了解：党对人民军队的领导是绝对必要的，没有党，也就不可能有人民军队。因此，他们便对右派分子进行了坚决的反击，不只是以无比的愤慨揭露了右派分子的丑恶面目，而且还更加热爱党，更加拥护党的领导。右派分子原想削弱党对人民军队的领导，如今适得其反，这大概会出乎他们的预料之外吧！
    其次，必须时刻保持高度警惕，严密防止敌人对我国社会主义事业的骚扰破坏。海军部队处于海防前线，应该建立起严格的战备制度，加强海上、空中的巡逻警戒，有效地防止敌人的偷袭破坏，保护航道和渔业生产的安全，保卫国家的社会主义建设。
    战备真正的加强，依靠艰苦的紧张的训练。根据实战需要，加强军官训练和加强复杂条件下的训练特别重要。不迅速培养出更多的具有现代海战指挥技能的军官，不把部队训练得都具有在任何复杂条件下进行战斗的本领，我们是不可能把仗打胜的。就是从海军建设的前景来看，加强训练也十分必要。海军技术正在日新月异地发展，如果我们不加快步伐赶到海军技术发展的前头去，我们就会落后，而落后是一定要挨打的。
    我国人民是勇敢的、勤劳的和有才能的。有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，这样的人民一定能亲手洗清旧社会遗留下来的一切落后痕迹，挺身走进世界上最先进的行列。现在热烈庆祝人民解放军建军三十周年，海军全体人员无不欢欣鼓舞，信心百倍。依靠党的领导，依靠人民的支援，依靠人民解放军奋战三十年创立的光荣传统，海军建设必将迅速地加强起来，一支强大的海军战斗力量必将有效地保卫起我国的海防。
