How Do the Party and Government Protect Cultural Relics?
Zheng Zhenduo's Speech

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li and Bo, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Ulanhu.

Now, I will give a report on the work of protecting cultural relics, which I am more familiar with, to prove how the Party and government care about protecting above-ground, underground, ancient, and revolutionary cultural relics, as well as library materials.

Some right-wing elements are always sarcastically saying that the Party and government do not protect ancient cultural relics, library materials are never collected and organized, ancient buildings are left to collapse without being repaired, and even say that in the eight years since liberation, the Party and government have "only destruction, no protection" of cultural relics. I cannot help but express my utmost anger at these slanders and lies! If they are not harboring ulterior motives, using the face of protectors of ancient cultural relics to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, they would never tell such blatant lies.

Esteemed delegates are very concerned about the protection of books and cultural relics. Let us recall the dark days before liberation, the painful era when imperialists colluded with reactionary rulers to steal and export the most precious cultural relics of our motherland. Those who have been to Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang will angrily denounce the despicable and hateful act of the imperialists who chiseled off the two most exquisite Northern Wei Dynasty reliefs of emperors and empresses worshiping Buddha from the Binyang Cave and stole them to American imperialism. Seeing a smiling Buddha head, they would chop it off with an axe, and even a delicately carved hand was not spared. So many museums and private collectors of imperialists have displayed bronzes, jades, Qin and Han bricks, tiles, and bronze mirrors of the Three Dynasties, statues of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Sui and Tang pottery figurines and tri-color glazed pottery, the most exquisite paintings, porcelain, furniture, decorations, etc. since the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, and even entire ancient buildings. Which one was not openly stolen and transported out! As for library materials, even more were stolen. The most comprehensive collections of local chronicles and genealogies from various provinces and cities are in the Library of Congress in the United States. Why did they collect these first-hand original resource materials of China? They also collected as much material on modern history as possible. Are these merely collections of well-intentioned documents and materials? An American once declared: "In a few years, those who want to study Chinese learning will probably have to come to the United States."

But their fantasy did not come true, and it will never come true! Since the national liberation in 1949, the Party and government have attached great importance to the protection of ancient and revolutionary cultural relics and library materials. (As early as before 1949, during the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army rescued more than 4,000 volumes of Zhao Cheng's Jin Dynasty carved books with blood and sweat. After the liberation of Shandong Province, several cultural relics preservation committees were immediately established.) The Cultural Relics Bureau was established in the central Ministry of Culture as a specialized agency responsible for the protection of cultural relics. Cultural relics management committees were established in various provinces and cities, and cultural relics work teams and several research institutes (Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute), preservation offices, etc. were established in key areas. The Government Administration Council promulgated several laws and decisions on the protection of cultural relics, eliminating the path for imperialists to steal and export our precious cultural relics and library materials. From this era onwards, our scientists and artists have the opportunity to see many important unearthed and collected cultural relics and library materials of the motherland that they never had the opportunity to see in the past.

In the past eight years, with the socialist transformation and socialist construction, our cultural relics work has also developed unprecedentedly. The first is the issue of training cadres. At the beginning of liberation, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had only 37 people. Now it has grown to nearly eight times, that is, 292 people. From 1952 to 1955, training classes for archaeological workers were held every year, and cadres from various provinces and cities were selected to participate in the study, with a total of 341 people trained. After 1956, several provinces and cities (including the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region) also held training classes for archaeological personnel or lectures for archaeological personnel, which ensured the continuous improvement of the quality of archaeological excavations. In coordination with the country's large-scale industrial construction and agricultural production construction, these archaeological workers have cleared 165 ancient cultural sites and 27,187 ancient tombs, and obtained 362,026 cultural relics in addition to millions of pottery shards. Many of these ancient cultural sites and ancient tombs are very important. Such as the Old Stone Age sites in Dingcun Village, Xiangfen County, and Licun Xigou, Quwo County, Shanxi Province; the Neolithic site in Banpo Village, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province (now a Neolithic museum); the tomb of Prince Guo of the Western Zhou Dynasty discovered within the Sanmenxia Reservoir; the wooden coffin tomb of Chu State discovered in Xinyang, Henan (nearly 300 pieces of unearthed lacquerware and woodware, nearly 200 pieces of bronzes, and more than 120 bamboo slips); the chariot and horse pits discovered at the Western Zhou site in Xi'an and Fengxi; the Han Dynasty bronze and gold ware discovered in Jinning, Yunnan, etc., too many to list at one time. In the past, those discovered cultural relics would have been scattered to imperialist countries, but now they are completely, properly protected, preserved, sorted out, and studied by us. Chinese scientists and artists are extremely excited to hear these major news and can quickly see these unearthed objects. Isn't this an unprecedented era of archaeological work? Without the leadership of the Party and the government, there would never have been such great achievements in a short period of time.

Regarding the protection of ancient buildings and revolutionary memorial buildings, the Party and the government have also used great efforts and done a lot of work. This is an arduous and costly undertaking, but the Party and the government have never bowed their heads in the face of difficulties. Under the principle of careful calculation, no waste, and no extravagance, the important ancient temples, palaces, city walls, bridges, stone towers, brick pagodas, wooden pagodas, etc. have been basically protected in the past eight years. Like the Great Wall, the Tang Dynasty buildings Nanchansi Temple and Foguangsi Temple on Wutai Mountain in Shanxi Province, the Great Stone Bridge in Zhao County, Hebei Province, the Longxing Temple in Zhengding, Hebei Province, the Confucius Temple and Confucius Forest in Qufu, the Forbidden City in Beijing, many gardens in Suzhou, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom sites in Nanjing and other places, etc., are not only firmly protected and properly kept, but also given necessary repairs. There are a total of 124 ancient buildings nationwide that are presided over or designed by the central government. Revolutionary memorial buildings in Ruijin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Yan'an, and other places have also been protected and repaired.

Regarding cultural relics, books, and materials scattered throughout the country, the Party and the government have also used great efforts in collecting and sorting them out. The central Ministry of Culture alone has collected 155,968 pieces of precious books, paintings, bronzes, porcelain, etc. On the basis of the books and cultural relics collected in Shanghai, several large-scale libraries and a large museum with brilliant and spectacular exhibits have been established. The libraries and museums in other regions have also been greatly enriched in the past eight years. The Beijing Library has collected more rare books in the past eight years than in the 38 years before liberation! At the time of liberation, the Beijing Library had only about one million books in its collection. Now it has 4.4 million books!

In order to further improve the work of cultural relics protection, the Ministry of Culture notified the cultural departments in various regions in 1956 to engage in cultural relics census work. This work mobilized and organized social forces in various regions. At this time of this year, there was a preliminary result. Except for the Tibet region, the provinces and cities nationwide have investigated and announced 6,513 cultural relics protection units by the provincial and municipal people's committees. Each protection unit contains several or dozens or hundreds of items. For example, under the "protection unit" of the Confucius Temple in Qufu, there are at least two to three hundred historical steles, Han Dynasty stone carvings, Han stone figures, Ming and Qing architectural complexes; and tens of thousands of Ming and Qing archives and clothes and other daily necessities, etc.

Such protection work is being carried out vigorously in a planned, organized, and directed manner, which is not only undreamed of in the past era, but also unimaginable by any imperialist or capitalist country. These living facts are in front of us, completely enough to defeat the right-wing elements' slanderous lies of "only destruction, no protection"!

Of course, in such a vast area, with complex work and insufficient manpower, some mistakes and shortcomings are difficult to avoid. For example, in archaeological excavation work, the quality is still not ideal; in the protection of ancient buildings, there are still some places that are not detailed enough, etc. But we welcome all well-intentioned and positive criticisms and suggestions. For example, we want to immediately clear up the backlog of books and make the catalog public as soon as possible to provide for the application of experts. We will check and correct these tasks at any time. At the same time, in some places, individual leading comrades, some cadres, and the masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of cultural relics excavation and protection work. This is a shortcoming of our work. We should continue to publicize the Party and government's policy of protecting cultural relics, and do a better job in protecting and sorting out cultural relics, so that it can play a greater role in the development of scientific research work in our country and in the education of the broad masses of people.

### 党和政府是怎样保护文物的？  郑振铎的发言

专栏：

    党和政府是怎样保护文物的？
    郑振铎的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的报告和李、薄副总理、董必武院长、张鼎丞检察长、彭真副委员长、乌兰夫副总理的报告。
    我现在就我所比较熟悉的保护文物工作，作一个报告，证明党和政府是怎样关心于保护地上、地下的古代文物和革命文物以及图书资料的。
    有好些右派分子老是若讽若讥的说，党和政府是不保护古代文物的，图书资料是从不加以收集和整理的，古代建筑是听任其塌倒而不加以修整的，甚至说，解放八年来，党和政府对于文物“只有破坏，没有保护”。我对于这些谰言谎语，不能不表示万分的愤怒！如果不是别有用心，用古代文物的保护者的面目而进行反党、反社会主义的活动，他们是决不会这样闭着眼睛说瞎话的。
    各位代表们是十分关心图书文物的保护工作的。让我们回想起解放前的那个黑暗时代，那个帝国主义者们勾结了反动统治者怎样地把祖国的最宝贵的文物盗运出口的辛酸时代吧。到过洛阳龙门的人们都会愤怒的控诉帝国主义者把宾阳洞里最精美的北魏时代的两大幅帝、后礼佛图的浮雕凿了下来，盗运到美帝国去的可鄙可恨的事实。看见一具甜蜜地微笑着的佛头，就会用斧头斫了下来，甚至连一只雕斫得十分秀丽的手，也没有放过了它。许多帝国主义者的博物馆里，私人收藏家里，所陈列着的三代鼎彝、玉器，秦、汉砖瓦、铜镜，南北朝造像，隋唐泥俑和三彩器皿，唐、宋、元、明以来的最精美的绘画、瓷器、家俱、装饰品等等，甚至整座的古建筑，那一件不是明目张胆地被盗运出去的！至于图书资料则偷漏出去的更多了。各省、市的地方志和家谱，在美国国会图书馆收藏得最多。他们为什么要收集中国的这些第一手的原始的资源材料？近代史的资料，他们也罗致得尽可能地多。这些仅是好心肠的文献资料的收集么？有一个美国人曾经大言道：“再过若干年，要研究中国学问的人恐怕非到美国来不可了。”
    但他们的幻想并不曾实现，也永远不会实现了！从一九四九年全国解放以来，党和政府就十分重视古代的和革命的文物和图书馆资料的保护工作。（远在一九四九年之前，在抗日战争的最艰苦的年代里，八路军就曾以血和汗抢救了四千多卷金代刻本的赵城藏出来。山东省解放后，就立即成立了好几处的文物保管委员会。）在中央文化部，成立了文物局，作为负责保护文物的专门机构，在各省、市成立了文物管理委员会，在重点地区，成立了文物工作队和若干研究所（敦煌文物研究所）、保管所等。政务院公布了好几件有关保护文物的法令和决定，根绝了帝国主义者们盗运我国珍贵文物和图书资料出口的道路。从这个时代开始，我们的科学家们和艺术家们才有机会能够看到过去所从来没有机会看到的祖国许多出土的和收集来的重要文物和图书资料。
    这八年来，随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设，我们的文物工作也有空前的发展。首先是培养干部问题。中国科学院考古研究所，在解放初期，全所只有三十七人，现在已经发展到将近八倍，即二百九十二人。从一九五二年起到一九五五年止，每年都举办一次考古工作人员训练班，抽调各省、市若干干部参加学习，一共训练了三百四十一人。一九五六年后，若干省、市（包括新疆维吾尔自治区）也都举办了考古人员训练班或考古人员讲习会，这就保证了考古发掘工作的质量的不断提高。配合了国家大规模的工业建设和农业生产建设，这些考古工作人员，清理了古文化遗址一百六十五处，古墓葬二万七千一百八十七座，获得了除数以百万计的陶片以外的文物三十六万二千零二十六件。这些古文化遗址和古墓葬有许多是十分重要的。像山西襄汾县的丁村和曲沃县的里村西沟两处的旧石器遗址；陕西西安半坡村的新石器时代遗址（现已成为一个新石器时代的博物馆）；三门峡水库范围内发现的西周虢太子墓；河南信阳发现的楚国木椁墓（出土漆器、木器近三百件，铜器近二百件，竹简一百二十多根）；西安、沣西的西周遗址发现的车马坑；云南晋宁发现的汉代铜器、金器等等，一时也举之不尽。在过去，那些发现的文物，都会是流散到帝国主义的国家里的，但如今是完整地、妥善地为我们所保护、保存，并加以整理，予以研究。中国的科学家们、艺术家们是万分兴奋地听到这些重大消息，并且能够很快地就看到这些出土物的。这不是一个空前的考古工作的大时代么？如果没有党和政府的领导是决不会在短时间内有那末大的成绩的。
    关于保护古代建筑和革命纪念建筑方面，党和政府也用了很大的力量，做了很多的工作。这是一个艰巨而费用浩大的事业，但党和政府从来没有在困难面前低过头。在精打细算，不浪费、不铺张的方针下，八年来基本上保护了古代重要的寺庙、宫殿、城墙、桥梁、石阙、砖塔、木塔等。像长城，山西五台寺的唐代建筑南禅寺和佛光寺，河北赵州的大石桥，河北正定的隆兴寺，曲阜的孔庙、孔林，北京的故宫，苏州的好些园林，南京和其他地方的太平天国遗址等等，不仅予以坚决的保护，妥善的保管，而且加以必要的修缮。对全国范围内，由中央主持或设计的古建筑共有一百二十四处。瑞金、上海、广州、延安等地的革命纪念建筑物，也都已予以保护和修缮。
    关于流传有自散失在全国各地的文物、图书、资料等，党和政府也用了很大的力量在收集、在整理。单是中央文化部所收集到的珍贵的图书、绘画、铜器、瓷器等等就有十五万五千九百六十八件。在上海在收集到的图书文物的基础上，成立了几个规模很大的图书馆和一个一个陈列品十分灿烂可观的大博物馆。其他地区的图书馆、博物馆，在八年来也都大大地充实起来了。北京图书馆在八年来所收集的善本图书，就比解放前三十八年的总和超过了一倍多！解放时，北京图书馆全部藏书只有一百万册左右，现在，已经有四百四十万册了！
    为了进一步做好文物保护工作，文化部在一九五六年，就通知各地文化部门，从事于文物普查工作，这个工作，动员并组织了各地区的社会力量。在今年这个时候，就有了一个初步的结果。除西藏地区外，全国各省、市所调查并经省、市人民委员会公布的文物保护单位，共为六千五百一十三个，每一个保护单位，都包含有几个或几十个或几百个项目。像在曲阜孔庙这一个“保护单位”项下，就至少包含着二三百个的历代碑碣、汉画象石、汉石人、明清建筑群；还有数以万计的明清档案和衣服及其他日用品等等。
    这样的保护工作，有计划、有组织、有方向地大力地进行着，不仅是过去时代所不曾梦想过的，而且也是任何帝国主义或资本主义国家所不能够设想过去办的。这些活生生的事实，罢在面前，完全足以打垮右派分子所谓“只有破坏，没有保护”的谰言谎语！
    当然，在那末地域广大、工作繁复、人力不足的情况下，若干错误和缺点是难于避免的。像在考古发掘工作方面，质量是还不够理想；在保护古建筑方面，还有些不够细致的地方等等。但我们欢迎一切善意的积极的批评和建议。例如，有好些人提出的关于图书的积压和整理问题，我们就想立即进行扫清积压现象，尽快地编目公开，供给专家们的应用。对这些工作我们是要随时检查，随时加以纠正的。同时，在某些地方，个别领导同志，一部分干部和群众，对文物发掘和保护工作的重大意义还认识不足。这是我们工作的缺点。我们应当继续宣传党和政府保护文物的政策，更好地做好保护和整理文物的工作，使它对我国科学研究工作的发展和对广大人民群众的教育，发挥出更大的作用。
