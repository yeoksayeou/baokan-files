The People of Jinggang Mountain Miss Chairman Mao

In Maoping Village, Ninggang County, at the foot of Jinggang Mountain, there is an ordinary ancestral hall – the Xie Family's Shenggong Ancestral Hall. Elderly people in Maoping Village told me that Chairman Mao held important meetings in this ancestral hall. In October 1928, the Second Congress of the Xianggan Border Region Party was held here, and Chairman Mao delivered his famous report: "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?"

Not far from Shenggong Ancestral Hall is the Octagonal Pavilion where Chairman Mao lived for several dozen days. This is a small square room in a civilian house, about one zhang in length and width. In the center of the ceiling is an octagonal skylight. Inside the room are a long table and chair that Chairman Mao used for reading and writing. Slogans written by the Red Fourth Army's 12th Division, 35th Regiment Headquarters remain on the wall.

Farmers who once stood guard near the small northeastern slope of the Octagonal Pavilion thirty years ago told me that at that time, the Schima superba and camphor trees on the hillside were not as tall as they are now, and there used to be a bamboo forest at the foot of the hillside. Late at night, every household was asleep, and only the dim light in the Octagonal Pavilion shone through the paper window into the rustling bamboo forest. Chairman Mao had not yet rested and was contemplating revolutionary matters.

After Chairman Mao led his troops to Jinggang Mountain, the first military hospital was set up at the current location of Maoping Elementary School. Seeing this gradually expanding school, people often talked about the stories of Chairman Mao often visiting the hospital to see and comfort the wounded and sick soldiers.

Xie Huaifu, an old farmer from Yangqiaohu, Buyun Mountain, Maoping, talking about the time when Chairman Mao lived in his house, pointed to the pear tree in front of the house, laden with fruit, and said: This tree is much bigger than it was thirty years ago. It has also been thirty years since Chairman Mao left here. However, some fragments of Chairman Mao's life have remained fresh in the memory of this sixty-year-old farmer. He cannot forget the simple life of Chairman Mao sleeping on door planks and using a "pearl quilt" when he stayed at his house. He said: One cold winter, many Red Army soldiers had already put on cotton clothes. However, Chairman Mao was only wearing three layers of single clothing. When he went out, he would put the pearl quilt from the bed over his shoulders. It was not until all the Red Army soldiers had received their cotton clothes that Chairman Mao finally received a set of cotton clothes, just like the soldiers, and put them on.

Speaking of cotton clothes, Xie Huaifu also recalled an incident about Chairman Mao's concern for the hardships of the working people. Xie Huaifu said: "One morning, there was a heavy fog, and I took my firewood knife up the mountain to chop wood, shivering with cold. Not far from the house, I met Chairman Mao, who was wearing the pearl quilt. Chairman Mao saw me shivering and saw that I was wearing single clothing, so he approached me and told me to wear more clothes because it was cold. I said I didn't have any clothes. Chairman Mao said that if I didn't have cotton clothes, I should wear a lined jacket. At this time, I was so moved that I couldn't speak. Chairman Mao! He himself had not yet put on cotton clothes, yet he was concerned about the cold and warmth of us poor peasants. Chairman Mao saw that I was silent and knew that I didn't even have a lined jacket. Two days later, Chairman Mao instructed the quartermaster to pick out a new dark blue cotton-padded jacket from the newly delivered military uniforms from the Red Army Taoliao Clothing Factory for me."

As Xie Huaifu and I walked and talked, we unknowingly arrived at the Buyun Mountain training ground. This is a temple built on a hillside during the Qianlong period. In those years, Chairman Mao taught the Red Army soldiers the strategies and tactics of guerrilla warfare here. The large lawn in front of the temple was where the Red Army trained in those years. Now, the temple is dilapidated, and the lawn has been cultivated and planted with sweet potatoes. The farmers of Yangqiaohu hope that the government can repair this commemorative revolutionary site.

We walked to a stone beside the mountain path leading from Yangqiaohu to Maoping Village, and Xie Huaifu stopped. He pointed to the stone and said to me that Chairman Mao often sat here to read.

Chairman Mao lived back and forth in Yangqiaohu for two years. Now, the people of Yangqiaohu, when talking about the changes in their lives from the past to the present, repeatedly told me excitedly: This is thanks to Chairman Mao. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we couldn't even dream of having today's happy life.

Not long ago, one hundred and two veteran cadres from the old Jinggang Mountain revolutionary base area held a meeting in the county seat to discuss how to actively engage in production and work, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." In their youth, they had all devoted themselves to the fiery struggles of Jinggang Mountain and had been taught by Chairman Mao. At the meeting, many people affectionately recalled the teachings and care that the Party and Chairman Mao had given them. During the breaks in the meeting, the elderly people sang the "Young Pioneers Song," "Go forward! Dawn is ahead, comrades, struggle!", and the stirring "Red Army Song," "Comrades, quickly pick up your guns, we are the armed forces of the workers and peasants." They appeared heroic and young. They all used heartfelt words to ask the reporter to express their remembrance and love for Chairman Mao.

Zhu Shiliu, a sixty-three-year-old farmer, participated in the meeting despite being ill. He had once been a reconnaissance squad leader in the Red Fourth Army's 31st Regiment, following Chairman Mao. He said: Chairman Mao lived a very simple life. He was very concerned about the soldiers. As soon as he noticed that someone was eating a little less food or that their complexion was a little off, he would tell them to find medical staff to take a look. During the eastward expedition from Jinggang Mountain, we sometimes slept in the open. Bamboo poles supported a piece of oilcloth the size of a mosquito net, which was the roof of Chairman Mao's room. Whenever it rained, Chairman Mao would not sleep but would ask us to sit next to him to avoid the rain. Chairman Mao often encouraged us that revolutionary soldiers should be able to endure hardship and hard work. In the most difficult environments, Chairman Mao was always full of spirit and used words full of revolutionary optimism to encourage everyone, and he took every opportunity to get close to the masses.

Innumerable stories and legends about Chairman Mao are circulating in the Jinggang Mountain area. Stories about whose house Chairman Mao stayed in for a night, where he gave a speech, who he had a cordial conversation with, etc., are recounted vividly, as if they had just happened.

Zou Wenkai, the former captain of the Da Jing Village Riot Team and an old farmer, said: "Chairman Mao was as warm and close as a member of the family in the homes of the Jinggang Mountain peasants." In the winter of 1928, when Chairman Mao led his troops away from Jinggang Mountain to embark on the eastward expedition, many peasants in Jinggang Mountain shed tears because they missed Chairman Mao. In those difficult days, looking forward to the stars and the moon, how much people hoped that Chairman Mao's troops would return!

Thirty years of long and arduous fighting have passed. The people of Jinggang Mountain have overcome hardships, ushered in the dawn, and are striding forward in the joyful socialist construction. They know how to defend their victory. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, they overfulfilled the task of donating aircraft and cannons by a factor of three. In the agricultural cooperation movement, the peasants of Da Xiao Wu Jing participated 100% in the Jinggang Mountain Agriculture and Forestry Production Cooperative. Last year, they also won the honorary title of county collective model cooperative.

When drinking water, remember the source. The people of Jinggang Mountain will always be grateful to the Communist Party and deeply miss Chairman Mao!

    井冈山人民想念毛主席
    新华社记者  古凡
    井冈山北麓宁冈县矛坪村，有一所普通的祠堂——谢氏慎公祠。矛坪村的老年人告诉我，在这座祠堂里，毛主席召开过重要的会议。1928年10月间，湘赣边区党的第二次代表大会在这里举行，毛主席在会上发表了著名的报告：“中国的红色政权为甚么能够存在？”
    离慎公祠不远，是毛主席住过几十天的八角楼。这是一幢民房里的一间正方形小室，方横约一丈。室顶正中开着一个八角形气窗。室内摆着毛主席读书、写字用过的一张长桌子和椅子。墙上留下了红四军十二师三五团团部写的标语。
    三十年前曾经在八角楼东北小山坡附近站岗放哨的农民告诉我，那时，山坡上的木荷树和樟树还没有现在这么高，山坡下原有一片竹林。夜深沉了，家家户户都睡觉了，只有八角楼里微明的灯光，透过纸窗射进飒飒响着的竹林里，毛主席还没有憩息，在思索革命大事。
    毛主席带领队伍到井冈山后，第一个军医院设在现在矛坪小学的地址。看到这个逐渐扩大的学校，人们常常谈起当年毛主席常到医院去探望和慰问伤病员的故事。
    矛坪步云山洋桥湖的老农民谢槐福，谈到毛主席住在他家的时候，指着屋前吊满了果实的梨树说：这棵树比三十年前大许多了。毛主席离开这里也三十年了。可是，毛主席的一些生活片断，却使这位六十岁的老农民永远记忆犹新。他不能忘记毛主席在他家时睡门板、铺珠被的简朴生活。他说：一年寒天，许多红军士兵已经穿上了棉衣。但是，毛主席却只穿着三件单衣，出外的时候，就拿床上的珠被披在身上。直到所有的红军战士都领到了棉衣，毛主席最后才领了一身和战士一样的棉衣穿上。
    说到棉衣，谢槐福又想起一件毛主席关怀劳动人民生活疾苦的往事。谢槐福说：“一天早晨，大雾，我拿着柴刀上山砍柴，冷得发抖。出门不远，我就遇见披着珠被的毛主席。毛主席见我抖颤着，一看我穿的是单衣，就挨近我的身旁嘱咐我，天气冷了，你要多穿衣。我说没有衣服。毛主席说，没有棉衣，穿上夹衣也好。这时，我感动得说不出话。毛主席啊！自己还没穿上棉衣，就关心我们穷庄稼汉的寒暖。毛主席看我不语，知道我连夹衣也没有。过了两天，毛主席就吩咐事务长从红军桃寮被服厂新挑来的军衣里拣了一件墨青色的新棉袄给我。”
    我和谢槐福边走边谈，不觉来到了步云山练兵场。这是山坡上一幢乾隆年间建造的寺庙。当年，毛主席在这里曾向红军战士们讲授过游击战争的战略和战术。寺庙前的一大片草坪，是红军当年练兵的地方。现在，寺庙已经破烂，草坪已开垦种上了蕃薯。洋桥湖的农民们，渴望政府能够修理这个有纪念意义的革命遗迹。
    我们走到从洋桥湖通往矛坪村的山腰路旁的一块石头旁，谢槐福站住了。他指着石头对我说，毛主席曾常常坐在这里看书。
    毛主席在洋桥湖来来去去住了两年。现在，洋桥湖的人民谈起今昔生活的变化，都一再激动地对我说：这是毛主席的恩情。没有共产党和毛主席的领导，做梦也别想有今天的幸福生活。
    不久前，宁冈县一百零二名老苏区干部在县城开会，商量怎样积极生产和工作，响应毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召。他们在青年时代都曾投身于井冈山的火热斗争，受过毛主席的教导。会上，许多人亲切地回忆起党和毛主席给他们的教导和关怀。会议休息的时间，老人们唱着“走上前去呵！曙光在前，同志们奋斗”的“少年先锋队歌”，唱着“同志们快快来拿起枪，我们是工农的武装”这首激昂的“红军歌”。他们显得豪迈而年轻。他们都用发自心坎的语言，要求记者表达他们对毛主席的怀念和热爱。
    六十三岁的农民朱诗柳，带病参加了会议。他曾经在红四军三十一团跟随毛主席当过侦察队长。他说：毛主席生活很朴素。对士兵十分关心，只要发现有人少吃一点饭或脸色有点不对，就吩咐去找医护人员看看。从井冈山出发东征期间，有时露宿。竹子撑起一块蚊帐顶一样大的油布，就是毛主席住室的屋顶。每逢下雨，毛主席就不睡了，叫我们一起坐在他的身旁避雨。毛主席常常鼓励我们，革命战士要能吃苦耐劳。遇到最困难的坏境，毛主席都精神饱满，用充满了革命乐观主义的话来鼓舞大家，并且有机会就去接近群众。
    井冈山地区流传着说不完的关于毛主席的故事和传说。毛主席曾经在谁家借宿一晚，在什么地方发表过演说，跟谁亲切地谈过话等等故事，人们谈起来有声有色，就像刚才发生的事一样。
    当年大井村暴动队队长、老农民邹文楷说：“毛主席在井冈山农民家中，亲切得像一家人。”1928年冬天，当毛主席带兵离开井冈山出发东征以后，井冈山许多农民都因想念毛主席，流下了热泪。在那苦难的日子里，盼星星，盼月亮，人们是多么盼望毛主席的队伍回来啊！
    三十年漫长的战斗的岁月过去了，井冈山人民战胜了苦难，迎接了黎明，在欢乐的社会主义建设中，昂首阔步前进。他们知道怎样保卫胜利，在抗美援朝战争中，他们超额三倍完成捐献飞机大炮的任务。在农业合作化运动中，大小五井的农民，百分之百地参加了井冈山农林业生产合作社。去年还获得了县集体模范社的光荣称号。
    饮水思源，井冈山人民永远感激共产党，深深怀念毛主席！
