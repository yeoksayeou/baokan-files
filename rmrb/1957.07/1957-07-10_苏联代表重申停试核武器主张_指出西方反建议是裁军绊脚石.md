Xinhua News Agency, London, July 8th: The United Nations Disarmament Committee's subcommittee continued its meeting on July 8th. Soviet representative Zorin pointed out at the meeting that the counter-proposals put forward by Western countries on the issue of nuclear weapons are aimed at hindering the disarmament conference from reaching an agreement.

Zorin said that the Soviet Union had proposed reaching an agreement on an immediate cessation of testing for two or three years, and establishing international supervision, including monitoring stations in the territories of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and in the Pacific region. The Soviet Union also suggested reaching an agreement on ceasing testing as a separate measure, without linking it to the resolution of other issues related to disarmament.

He pointed out that the representatives of Western countries expressed their agreement "in principle" to temporarily halt nuclear weapons testing. However, this consent was accompanied by many conditions and reservations, with the result that this consent had no practical significance. Their unrealistic attitude has complicated the issue. They also proposed limiting the duration of the temporary cessation of testing to ten months, a period that would not curb the nuclear arms race in the slightest. Therefore, the reason why an agreement on the cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons cannot be reached is due to the attitude adopted by Western countries.

Zorin went on to say that the Soviet Union considered that the cessation of the production of nuclear weapons only has practical significance when it is inextricably linked with the complete prohibition of such weapons, the elimination of such weapons from national armaments, and the destruction of stockpiled such weapons. If Western countries are now unwilling to accept this straightforward solution, the Soviet Union is willing to undertake obligations jointly with Western countries to make every effort to reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, including the elimination of such weapons from national armaments, the cessation of the production of such weapons, and the destruction of stockpiled such weapons.

However, Western countries are limited to proposing the cessation of the production of military fissile materials, but refuse to accept a solution regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the elimination of nuclear weapons from armaments. They not only insist on maintaining the atomic and hydrogen weapons that have already been stockpiled, but also declare their right to manufacture atomic and hydrogen bombs and improve these weapons using the fissile materials that have been accumulated. All of this renders the proposals of Western countries meaningless.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the Soviet Union suggests that everyone undertake a solemn obligation: to renounce the use of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons for military purposes. Western countries refuse to undertake an unconditional obligation not to use nuclear weapons, and they regard nuclear weapons as a major "deterrent" weapon. The proposals they have put forward in the subcommittee essentially aim to legalize nuclear weapons and to remove all obstacles to the storage of atomic weapons in other countries' territories and the training of other countries' armed forces in the use of atomic weapons.

The position taken by Western countries on this most important issue is now a stumbling block in the path to reaching an agreement.

Zorin reiterated that, considering the current specific circumstances, the Soviet government believes that temporarily stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons for two or three years and establishing international supervision is the first practical step to stopping the atomic arms race and a completely feasible step. All countries undertaking the obligation not to use such weapons is the minimum requirement for an overall partial disarmament agreement. If Western countries truly hope to end the atomic arms race and safeguard the world from the threat of atomic war, they should show a realistic attitude and remove the obstacles that are currently hindering the reaching of an agreement.

### 苏联代表重申停试核武器主张  指出西方反建议是裁军绊脚石

    苏联代表重申停试核武器主张
    指出西方反建议是裁军绊脚石
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社伦敦8日讯：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会7月8日继续举行会议。苏联代表佐林在会议上指出：西方国家就核武器问题所提出的反建议，其目的是要阻挠裁军会议达成协议。
    佐林说：苏联曾建议就立即停止试验两、三年达成协议，并建立国际监督，包括在苏联、美国、英国的领土上和太平洋地区设立监督站。苏联并且建议就停止试验达成协议，作为单独的措施，而不与裁军方面的其它问题的解决牵连在一起。
    他指出：西方国家代表表示“原则上”同意暂时停止试验核武器。但是，这种同意附带有许多条件和保留，其结果是这种同意根本没有实际意义。他们这种不现实的态度使这个问题复杂化了。他们还提出，把暂时停止试验的期限限为十个月，这样一个期限对原子军备竞赛丝毫不发生遏制作用。因此，所以不能达成停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协定，是由于西方国家采取的态度。
    佐林接着说：苏联考虑到，只有在使停止制造核武器同完全禁止这种武器、从国家的军备中取缔这种武器和销毁储存的这种武器不可分割地结合在一起的时候，停止制造核武器才有实际的意义。如果西方国家现在不愿意接受这种直截了当的解决办法，苏联愿意和西方国家共同承担义务，尽一切努力来达成关于全面禁止原子武器和氢武器的协议，其中包括从国家的军备中取缔这种武器，停止制造这种武器和销毁储存的这种武器。
    然而西方国家仅限于提出关于停止制造军用分裂物质的建议，却拒绝接受关于禁止核武器和从军备中取缔核武器的解决办法。它们不但坚持主张保持现在已储存的原子武器和氢武器，而且还声明自己有权用已经积累下来的分裂物质制造原子弹和氢弹以及改进这些武器。所有这一切都使西方国家的建议变成毫无意义。
    苏联代表指出：苏联建议大家承担一项庄严的义务：拒绝使用各种类型原子武器和氢武器于军事目的。西方国家拒绝承担不使用核武器的无条件义务，他们把核武器看成是一种主要的“威慑”武器。他们在小组委员会中所提出的建议，实质上是要使得核武器合法化，是为在别国领土上存放原子武器和训练其他国家武装部队使用原子武器扫除一切障碍。
    西方国家现在在这个最重要的问题上所采取的立场就是达成协议的道路上的一块绊脚石。
    佐林重申：考虑到目前的具体情况，苏联政府认为：暂时停止试验原子武器和氢武器两、三年并建立有国际监督的做法是停止原子军备竞赛的第一个实际的步骤，也是完全可行的步骤。各个国家承担起不使用这种武器的义务，是整个局部裁军协定的最低要求。如果西方国家真正希望结束原子军备竞赛和保障全世界不受原子战争威胁的话，它们就应当表现现实的态度，清除掉目前妨碍着达成协议的障碍。
