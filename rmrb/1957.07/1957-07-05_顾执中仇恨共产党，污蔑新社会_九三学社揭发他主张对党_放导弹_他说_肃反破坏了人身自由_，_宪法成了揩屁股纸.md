Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd. The Central Committee and Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society held a symposium tonight to expose Gu Zhizhong's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions. Seventeen people spoke at the symposium. They unanimously demanded that Gu Zhizhong "honestly drop his pants" and thoroughly confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance, as well as his anti-socialist activities such as plotting to organize a reactionary political party.

Zou Mingchu, a member of the Jiusan Society studying at the Socialist Academy, said that after the news of Lu Yi's exposure of Gu Zhizhong's conspiracy with Wang Zaoqi and others to organize a reactionary political party was published in the People's Daily today, all the students in Gu Zhizhong's group asked him today to give a detailed account of his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance and the conspiracy to organize a reactionary political party. Gu Zhizhong said, "I was betrayed by Lu Yi." Gu Zhizhong also admitted that when Wang Zaoqi came to Beijing, he went to Wang Zaoqi's residence (Xinqiao Hotel) to talk with Wang, saw Wang writing an article, and slept there. However, he did not explain what he talked about with Wang Zaoqi and what Wang Zaoqi wrote. Everyone pointed out that Gu Zhizhong's attitude was extremely dishonest and warned Gu Zhizhong that only by honestly confessing could he be forgiven by the people.

Tang Jinwu, Li Duming, and Zhang Hongyuan, members of the Jiusan Society, were in the same branch as Gu Zhizhong. They exposed Gu Zhizhong's inflammatory activities in the Jiusan Society's grassroots organization. After the rectification campaign began, Gu Zhizhong repeatedly incited people at branch meetings to rectify the Communist Party with a stormy approach, setting fires everywhere, and even pushing the movement to primary and secondary schools. He also incited members to "enlarge the caliber of artillery" and "launch long-range and short-range missiles" to create chaos in the world. He also spread rumors among the members that the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society had established a five-person group, encouraging people to complain. When the People's Daily began to criticize the reactionary remarks of right-wingers, he promoted that this would cause social chaos and affect the airing of views. When Chu Anping's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks were criticized, he thought this was "punishing people for their words." Recently, when people criticized Gu Zhizhong's reactionary remarks, he said that the reporter had published his speech incorrectly and had sent a letter to correct it, and fabricated that the People's Daily had received many letters requesting corrections, which could not be published in several newspapers, in order to slander the Party newspaper.

Wang Jilin, Yang Muzhi, and Pi Xiaotao, members of the Jiusan Society working at the Higher Education Publishing House, exposed Gu Zhizhong's reactionary remarks at the Higher Education Publishing House. They pointed out that Gu Zhizhong originally studied at the Socialist Academy and rarely returned to the Higher Education Publishing House in the past, but after the rectification campaign began, he often went back. He encouraged people at the Higher Education Publishing House to "fire missiles," saying, "The Communist Party has made such a mess of the country, and the democratic parties must take responsibility because the democratic parties used to support the Communist Party," inciting people to "complain" and "take revenge" on the Communist Party. Gu Zhizhong also introduced the rectification "experience" of the Socialist Academy everywhere, saying that the opinions raised there were "bloody."

Li Yi, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, exposed Gu Zhizhong's speeches at the Socialist Academy in the name of "defending the Constitution," opposing previous movements. Gu Zhizhong, based on his distorted anti-rightist movement and certain individual phenomena in social life, promoted that "the anti-rightist movement destroyed personal freedom," "there is no freedom of speech and publication," and "the people's right to education is nominal," and therefore concluded: "The Constitution has become toilet paper." Li Yi said that this was Gu Zhizhong's most malicious slander against the Constitution and the socialist democratic system, and his attempt was to incite people to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism.

Li Yi said that not long ago, Gu Zhizhong personally drafted a proposal at the Socialist Academy to "request the National People's Congress to organize a special committee to examine violations of the Constitution," and collected more than a dozen signatures from students, preparing to ask the people's representatives studying at the Socialist Academy to submit it to the National People's Congress. Li Yi said that this was a serious political action and an attempt to push the rampant attack of the bourgeois right-wingers to a new climax. Li Yi demanded that Gu Zhizhong explain his actions.

Li Zuyin, a member of the Beijing Branch of the Jiusan Society, exposed Gu Zhizhong's protection of Chu Anping. When the Jiusan Society criticized Chu Anping's reactionary remarks on June 8, Gu Zhizhong said: "Chu Anping's speech may have good intentions, but the wording was inappropriate and provocative."

Many people also exposed in their speeches that Gu Zhizhong ostensibly sang the tune of democracy and freedom, but actually peddled the private goods of bourgeois democracy. According to the exposure, Gu Zhizhong slandered Xinhua News Agency and attempted to set up a private news agency to compete with Xinhua News Agency. He advocated that "Xinhua News Agency should only send news internationally, and domestic news should be open to democratic parties and organizations to run news agencies." People asked: If a right-winger like you, Gu Zhizhong, were to run a news agency, what benefits would it bring to socialist construction?

Gu Zhizhong did not speak at today's meeting. The symposium will continue.

    顾执中仇恨共产党，污蔑新社会
    九三学社揭发他主张对党“放导弹”
    他说“肃反破坏了人身自由”，“宪法成了揩屁股纸”
    新华社3日讯　九三学社中央委员会和北京市分社在今晚举行座谈会，揭发顾执中的反党反社会主义的言行。在座谈会上有十七人发了言。一致要求顾执中“老实脱裤子”，彻底交代他同章罗同盟的关系，以及阴谋组织反动政党等反社会主义活动。
    在社会主义学院学习的九三学社成员邹明初说，陆诒揭露顾执中同王造时等阴谋组织反动政党的消息今天在人民日报上登出以后，顾执中所在小组的全体学员今天曾要求他详细交代同章罗联盟的关系以及阴谋组织反动政党的情况，顾执中却说：“我被陆诒出卖了。”顾执中还承认，在王造时来北京时，他曾去王造时的住所（新侨饭店）同王谈了话，看见王写文章并且在那里睡了觉。但是他不交代他同王造时究竟谈了什么，王造时写什么文章。大家指出，顾执中的这种态度是极不老实的，并正告顾执中，只有老实交代才能得到人民宽恕。
    九三学社成员唐进武、李笃明、张鸿瑗和顾执中在一个支社过组织生活。他们揭发顾执中在九三学社基层组织进行的煽动性活动。整风开始后，顾执中多次在支社会议上煽动人们用狂风暴雨式的方法整共产党，到处点火，甚至要把运动推到中小学。他并煽动社员要“放大口径炮”、要“放远距离和近距离的导弹”，把天下搞乱。他又在社员中造谣说九三学社北京分社成立了五人小组，鼓动人们去诉苦。当人民日报开始批判右派分子的反动言论时，他宣扬这将引起社会混乱，影响鸣放。储安平的反党反社会主义言论遭到批判时，他又认为这就是“言者有罪”。最近，人们批评顾执中的反动言论，他又说是记者登错了他的发言，已去信更正，并无中生有地说，人民日报收到很多要求更正的信，几张报纸都登不完，以诬蔑党报。
    在高教出版社工作的九三学社成员王继麟、杨慕之和皮筱韬揭露了顾执中在高教出版社的反动言论。他们指出，顾执中本来在社会主义学院学习，过去很少回到高教出版社，但在整风开始后，他却常常回去，他鼓励高教出版社的人“放导弹”，说“共产党把国家事情搞的这样糟糕，民主党派要负责任，因为民主党派过去都是捧共产党”，煽动人们向共产党“诉苦”、“报仇”。顾执中还到处介绍社会主义学院的整风“经验”，说那里的人提的意见“都是血淋淋的”。
    九三学社中央委员李毅揭露顾执中在社会主义学院以“保卫宪法”为名，发表反对历次运动的言论。顾执中根据经过他歪曲了的肃反运动以及社会生活中某些个别现象，就宣扬“肃反运动破坏了人身自由”、“没有言论出版自由”、“人民受教育权有名无实”，并因此得出结论：“宪法成了揩屁股纸”。李毅说，这是顾执中对于宪法和社会主义民主制度的最恶意污蔑，他的企图是想煽动人们反对共产党，反对社会主义。
    李毅说，顾执中不久以前在社会主义学院还亲自草拟了“请人民代表大会组织专门委员会检查违反宪法问题”的提案，并征集学员十余人签名，准备请在社会主义学院学习的人民代表在人民代表大会上提出。李毅说，这是一个严重的政治行动，是企图把资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻推向新的高潮。李毅要求顾执中交代他的这一行动。
    九三学社北京分社委员李祖荫揭发顾执中庇护储安平。当6月8日九三学社批评储安平的反动言行时，顾执中却说：“储安平的发言，意思可能是好的，但用词不当，有刺激性。”
    许多人在发言中，还揭露了顾执中表面上高唱民主自由的调子，实际上贩卖资产阶级民主的私货。据揭露，顾执中曾诽谤新华社，并企图办私人通讯社同新华社唱对台戏。他主张“新华社只向国际发消息，国内则开放让民主党派、团体办通讯社。”人们问：假如让你顾执中这样的右派分子办起通讯社来，对社会主义建设能有什么好处？
    顾执中没有在今天的会上发言。座谈会还将继续进行。
