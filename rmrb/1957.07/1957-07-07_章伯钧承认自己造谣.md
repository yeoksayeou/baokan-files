    Zhang Bojun Admits to Spreading Rumors

    The remarks I made on June 6th during a symposium with six professors, regarding big-character posters being put up at the gate of the State Planning Commission, as exposed by Comrade Min Ganghou, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, in the People’s Daily on July 4th, are due to my standing on an anti-Party, anti-socialist position. It was hearsay taken as truth, an extremely erroneous act of slander against the Party that did not conform to the facts, which caused extreme anger among all comrades of the State Planning Commission, who lodged strong and stern protests and accusations against me. I feel deeply remorseful. I now issue this correction and offer my apology to them.

　　　　　　Zhang Bojun　July 6th

    章伯钧承认自己造谣
    7月4日人民日报上发表的民盟中央常务委员闵刚侯同志所揭发的关于6月6日我在一次六教授座谈会上所说的计委门口贴大字报的话，是由于我站在反党反社会主义的立场，道听途说以无当有不符合事实的极端错误的污蔑党的言行，因此引起计委全体同志的极端愤怒并向我提出强烈的严正的抗议和指责。我感到万分痛悔，我现在发表这个更正声明并向他们请罪。　　　　　　章伯钧　7月6日
