    Don't Fabricate Something Out of Nothing
    Han Lan'gen, a comedian who has been working in the film industry for many years, recently joined the Changchun Film Studio, and met his old partner Yin Xiucen again. They are co-producing a comedy film "An Unfinished Comedy". One-third of the film has been shot, and it is expected to be released in October this year.
    However, many newspaper reporters have made "empty talk" style reports about their activities. Not long ago, some newspapers in Changchun and Shanghai published news about them, saying that they had started co-producing a film "Treasure Bottle Scheme," which was completely fabricated out of thin air. Recently, a Xinhua News Agency reporter casually took a group photo of the two of them at Changchun Film Studio, but some newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places said that they were "studying their work" when publishing the photo; in the June issue of "Chinese Film" this year, the description of the photo was even more specific, saying, "This is the two of them studying the character of the characters in the comedy short film '1 to 0' script, which is about to start shooting." In fact, this script only has an outline so far and has not been written, let alone "about to start shooting."
    The broad audience has long been eager for comedy films, and such reports will surely arouse great interest among readers. If the reports are untrue, the impact of newspapers on readers will be very bad. It is hoped that newspapers and periodicals will make sure to investigate and verify the information before publishing such news in the future, and not fabricate something out of nothing.

    不要无中生有
    从事电影工作多年的喜剧演员韩兰根最近参加了长春电影制片厂工作，和他多年合作的老伙伴殷秀岑又见面了。他们正在合拍一部喜剧片“没有完成的喜剧”。这部片子现在已经拍了三分之一了，预计今年十月份可以出片。
    可是许多报刊记者对于他们的活动却作了客里空式的报道。不久以前，长春和上海的一些报纸刊登了关于他们的消息，说他们已开始合拍一部影片“宝瓶计”，这完全是无中生有的事。最近新华社有一位记者来长影随便给他们二位拍了一张合照，可是南京、上海等地某些报纸刊登这张照片时，却说他们是在“研究工作”；到今年六月号“中国电影”上，对这张照片的说明更加具体了，说是“这是他俩正在研究即将开拍的喜剧短片‘1比0’剧本中的人物性格”。其实这个剧本目前才只有提纲，还没有写成，当然更谈不到“即将开拍”了。
    广大观众久已渴望喜剧影片，这类报道一定会引起读者极大的兴趣，如果报道失实，报刊在读者中的影响是很不好的。希望以后报刊在刊登这类消息时，能事先切实调查清楚，不要无中生有。  锡三
