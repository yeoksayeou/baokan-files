Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: TASS reports that the Soviet and Czechoslovakian Party and Government delegations began talks on the afternoon of July 10th at the Czech Communist Party Central Committee building.

    The two delegations exchanged information on the activities of their respective parties and governments in the recent period. The talks were held in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, which once again confirmed the complete agreement of views between the two sides.

    On the Soviet side, those participating in the talks included Khrushchev, Bulganin, Patalichev, Ivashchenko, V. Grishin, and others.

    On the Czechoslovakian side, those participating in the talks included Barak, Ďuranský, Feringer, Köpecký, Novotný, Široký, Zápotocký, and others.

    An agreement was reached that a joint communique would be issued regarding the visit of the Soviet Party and Government delegation and the talks between the two delegations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 11th: The Political Bureau of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, the President and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic held a grand banquet on the 10th at Prague Palace to welcome Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet Party and Government delegation.

    Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin spoke at the banquet.

    Široký pointed out in his speech that the Soviet delegation's arrival in Prague coincides with the Soviet people achieving new and outstanding successes in domestic and foreign affairs, and precisely when the Soviet people and all progressive forces in the world are once again solemnly declaring their confidence in the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Široký said that the resolutions of the recent plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee are of far-reaching significance not only for the Soviet Union but also for all the people of Czechoslovakia, for the victory of the entire socialist cause, and for world peace.

    Široký said that we, the Czechoslovak Communists, consider the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be a long-tested force and the center of the international revolutionary workers' movement, and thus the most important decisive force in world history. The unity of the Leninist Party is infinitely precious to us, because its unity and strength are the foundation of the unity and strength of our party and the entire international working class.

    Bulganin emphasized in his speech the importance of the unbreakable friendship between the Czechoslovak and Soviet peoples. He said that as long as we are united, as long as the people of socialist countries are a harmonious family, all attempts by the enemy to obstruct our victorious advance along the path of socialism will never succeed.

    Bulganin said that the Czechoslovak Communist Party and our party have always been in agreement in paying constant attention to strengthening the unity of the party ranks and in opposing all attempts and actions by sectarian elements to weaken this unity. Therefore, we are very pleased to learn that the Czech Communist Party unanimously condemned the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov and endorsed the resolute measures taken by the CPSU Central Committee to crush this group. It must be particularly emphasized that Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of our Party Central Committee, has made great contributions in exposing and crushing this group.

    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克两国党和政府代表团7月10日下午在捷共中央委员会大楼开始会谈。
    两国代表团交换了自己的党和政府在最近时期的活动的情况。会谈是在诚恳和友好的气氛中进行的，它又一次证实了双方观点的完全一致。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、帕托利切夫、伊瓦申科、符·格里申等。
    捷克斯洛伐克方面参加会谈的有巴拉克、杜兰斯基、费林格、柯别茨基、诺沃提尼、西罗基、萨波托斯基等。
    双方达成协议，关于苏联党和政府代表团的访问以及两国代表团的会谈将发表联合公报。
    据新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统和政府10日在布拉格宫举行盛大宴会，欢迎赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和苏联党和政府代表团的其他人员。
    捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基和苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁先后在会上讲了话。
    西罗基在讲话中指出，苏联代表团来到布拉格的时候正是苏联人民在内政外交方面取得新的卓越成就的时候，正是苏联人民和全世界进步力量再一次庄严地宣布自己对于苏共第二十次代表大会决议的信心的时候。西罗基说，苏共中央最近举行的全体会议的决议不仅对于苏联、而且对于捷克斯洛伐克全体人民、对于整个社会主义和世界和平事业的胜利都具有深远的意义。
    西罗基说，我们捷克斯洛伐克共产党人认为苏联共产党是久经考验的队伍和国际革命工人运动的中心，从而也是世界历史的最重要的决定力量。列宁党的团结对于我们是无限珍贵的，因为它的团结和力量是我们党和整个国际工人的团结和力量的基础。
    布尔加宁在讲话中着重指出了捷苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊的重要意义。他说，只要我们是团结的，只要社会主义国家的人民是一个和谐的大家庭，敌人阻挠我们沿着社会主义的道路胜利前进的一切企图就决不能成功。
    布尔加宁说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和我们党在经常注意加强党的队伍的团结、在反对宗派分子削弱这种团结的一切企图和行动方面，总是意见一致的。因此，我们得悉捷共一致谴责马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫反党集团并且赞同苏共中央为粉碎这个集团所采取的坚决措施，感到十分满意。必须特别着重指出，我们党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在揭露和粉碎这个集团中有巨大的功绩。
