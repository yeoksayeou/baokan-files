Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: Currently, rainfall is moderate in most parts of the country, but some local areas have experienced flooding and drought due to excessive or insufficient rainfall. To strive for a good harvest this year, the people in these areas are fighting against waterlogging and drought.

At present, some areas in Liaoning and Jiangxi provinces are still experiencing drought due to insufficient rainfall. These areas are working hard to overcome the drought. Since the drought occurred in Liaoning Province in late April, various localities have successively organized drought relief organizations and adopted various drought relief measures. By the end of June, the sowing tasks for dryland crops had been basically completed. In the Nanchang Special District of Jiangxi Province, more than 100,000 people were mobilized to fight the drought, saving more than 200,000 mu of intermediate rice from the threat of drought.

Northern Zhejiang Province, southern Jiangsu Province, and southern Anhui Province experienced flooding due to continuous and concentrated heavy rains or torrential rains at the beginning of this month. Several million mu of farmland in these areas were flooded. So far, with the round-the-clock rescue efforts of millions of farmers and strong support from all sides, the fight against waterlogging and crop protection has achieved great victory. Three-quarters of the five million mu of flooded fields in the Suzhou, Songjiang, and Jiaxing special districts have been drained of water, and members of agricultural cooperatives are carrying out tasks such as supporting seedlings, replanting, applying fertilizer, and weeding.

    全国大部地区雨水调和
    局部地区出现涝情和旱象
    新华社13日讯　目前全国大部地区雨水调和，但局部地区由于雨水过多或不足也出现了涝情和旱情。为争取今年农业的丰收，这些地区的人民正为排涝和抗旱而斗争。
    目前因雨水不足而仍呈现旱象的有辽宁和江西等省的一些地区，这些地区正为战胜干旱而努力。辽宁省自4月下旬发生旱情后，各地相继组织了抗旱组织，采取了各种抗旱措施，到6月底，旱田作物的播种任务已经基本完成。江西省南昌专区出动了十多万人与干旱斗争，使二十多万亩中稻摆脱了干旱的威胁。
    浙江省北部、江苏省南部和安徽省南部等地因本月初连续地集中地下了几场暴雨或大雨而发生了涝情。这些地区有几百万亩农田受涝。到目前为止，在百万农民日夜抢救和各方面的大力支援下，排涝保苗斗争已获得巨大胜利，苏州、松江、嘉兴三个专区五百万亩涝田已有四分之三排除了积水，农业社社员们正在进行扶苗、补苗、追肥和除草等工作。
