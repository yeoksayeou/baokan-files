Peking Normal University Faculty and Staff Rally Exposes Huang Shaohong's Harboring of Counter-Revolutionary Element Xie Xin

(Our Newspaper) This paper reports: At the National CPPCC meeting in March this year, Huang Shaohong said at the political and legal affairs group meeting that the anti-rebellion campaign at Beijing Normal University was a mess, and that a certain female youth (referring to Xie Xin) was struggled against and arrested during the anti-rebellion campaign because she returned from Hong Kong, and that no suitable arrangements have been made for her even now. He also claimed that he would go to the Normal University as a representative of the National People's Congress to inspect the anti-rebellion campaign and seek redress for her grievances. Is this really the case? On the afternoon of July 3, the rally of more than 6,000 faculty, staff, and students of Normal University to expose the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Xie Xin was a powerful refutation of Huang Shaohong's slander of the anti-rebellion movement.

Xie Xin was a student in the Russian Department of the Normal University and was from Fuzhou, Fujian Province. From 1943 to October 1945, she cohabitated with Wang Tiaoxun, director of the Fujian Provincial Investigation and Statistics Office of the Military Command, in Fuzhou. She went to Hong Kong in 1948. In September 1949, she came to Beijing from Hong Kong and was introduced to Beijing Normal University by the All-China Student Federation. At that time, due to the laxity of the school system in the early days of liberation, Xie Xin was allowed to enter the school without an examination. After entering school, her studies were consistently lax, and she often went out dancing and did not return to school until late at night. One day in 1951, she met Huang Shaohong while dancing at the CPPCC Cultural Club. Before and at the beginning of the anti-rebellion movement in 1955, Xie Xin openly wrote reactionary slogans on the walls, scolding the new society as a dark world, and conspired to commit murder, so she was arrested. The following is a summary of Xie Xin's handwritten confession on March 31, 1956: "Classmate Xia Ruiqiong asked me, who did you say you wanted to kill that day? I honestly said that I wanted to kill Yuan Xingju, the Communist Party group leader in charge of studies. Therefore, I went to Xisi Pailou and bought a knife back. I hadn't been back for five minutes when Comrades Liu Zhongmin and Chen Guomei, the leaders of the anti-rebellion team, came to ask for my knife. I refused to take it out in front of the classmates. Unexpectedly, they immediately called the classmates to search my belongings and took my two knives from under the bed, and then I was arrested. I intended to use the dumbbells to commit suicide. Later, when Director Ji came to understand the situation, I was very angry. Dean Ding was very rude, and I wanted to smash his two children to death with the dumbbells. I have now broken the law, and I am now going to accept the punishment given to me by the Party and the government. I hope the government will give me another chance to recognize my sins."

The Beijing People's Procuratorate should have filed a public prosecution and handed Xie Xin over to the court for trial based on the above crimes. However, because she admitted her guilt and showed signs of repentance, she was exempted from prosecution in accordance with the lenient policy and released back to school on November 23, 1956. Xie Xin did not repent after returning to school. On the contrary, she made a lot of noise, made many unreasonable demands, and immediately overturned the original case. When the school issued a notice announcing the conclusion on her case according to the People's Procuratorate's decision to exempt her from prosecution, she immediately smashed the glass of the notice board, tore off the notice, and distorted the facts, complaining everywhere. She also wrote to Huang Shaohong, and Huang Shaohong told her to her face that he would "cry injustice" for her. She also threatened the school, demanding a public apology and restoration of her reputation. She claimed that if her demands were not met, she would write slogans everywhere and appeal to the people of the world. In the early days of the rectification campaign, Xie Xin took this opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, posted a "Tearful Accusation" big-character poster, demanding the restoration of her reputation, and made another "Tearful Accusation" at the free forum, attempting to win the sympathy of the majority of students. When everyone refuted her fabricated accusations with facts, Xie posted a second "Tearful Accusation" big-character poster, saying that the old tears had not dried, and the school was creating new conspiracies. Xie knew that the school did not have a market for her rumors and slanders, and she flattered the reporters of imperialist countries, using distorted facts and slanderous remarks to defame our new society.

At today's meeting, more than 6,000 faculty, staff, and students were outraged after hearing about the crimes of the counter-revolutionary element Xie Xin and the fact that she took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to launch a frenzied attack. At the meeting, seventeen representatives of faculty, staff, and students angrily denounced Xie Xin as an incorrigible counter-revolutionary element and the dregs of university students. Due to time constraints, there were more than one hundred slips of paper handed to the podium that did not speak at the meeting. They unanimously demanded that the Party severely punish incorrigible counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the principle of "all counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and all mistakes must be corrected." No counter-revolutionary element should be missed. They demanded that the school expel her and that the procuratorial organs re-examine her case. Finally, the general meeting unanimously elected nineteen representatives of faculty, staff, and students to carry the meeting's letter to the Presidium of the National People's Congress, accusing Huang Shaohong of supporting and harboring the counter-revolutionary element Xie Xin.

    北京师范大学师生员工大会揭露
    黄绍竑包庇反革命分子谢昕
    本报讯　黄绍竑在今年3月全国政协会议政法小组会上说，北京师范大学的肃反搞坏了，某某女青年（即指谢昕）因为从香港回来，而在肃反中被斗被捕，现在还没有适当的安排。他还声称要以全国人民代表大会代表身份，去师大检查肃反，为她申冤。事实真的是这样吗？7月3日下午，师大六千余师生员工，揭发反革命分子谢昕罪行的大会，就是对黄绍竑诬蔑肃反运动的有力驳斥。
    谢昕是师范大学俄语系的学生，福建省福州人。1943年至1945年10月，在福州与军统福建省调统室主任王调勋姘居。1948年去香港。1949年9月从香港到北京，由全国学联介绍来北京师范大学。当时因解放初期，学校制度不严，未经考试就允许谢昕入学。入学后学习一贯松懈，经常外出跳舞至深夜才归校。1951年某日她在政协文化俱乐部跳舞中结识了黄绍竑。1955年肃反运动前及肃反运动开始时，谢昕公开在墙上写反动标语，谩骂新社会为黑暗世界，并预谋行凶杀人，因此被捕。1956年3月31日，谢昕亲笔供词摘要如下：“同班同学夏瑞琼问我，那一天你说要杀人，要杀谁？我照实说出是要杀领导学习的党员小组长袁行榘。因此，我就到西四牌楼买了一把刀回来。我回来还没有五分钟，领导肃反的小组同志刘忠敏、陈国眉来要我的刀，我不肯在同学们面前拿出。没有想到他们立即叫同学来搜查我的东西，就把我的两把刀在床里拿去了，后来我就被捕。铁哑铃是我企图自杀用的，后来季处长来了解情况时我很生气，丁教务长很粗暴，我要用铁哑铃砸死他的两个孩子。我现在已经犯法了，我现在要来接受党和政府给我的惩罚。我希望政府再给我认识罪恶的机会”。
    北京人民检察院根据谢昕以上罪行，本应提起公诉交付法庭审判，但因她承认罪恶，并有悔改表现，便根据宽大政策，免予起诉，于1956年11月23日释放她回校。谢昕回校后并没有悔改，相反地大吵大闹，提出许多无理要求，并立即推翻原案。学校按检察院免予起诉决定书出布告公布对她的结论时，她立即把布告牌玻璃砸碎，撕掉布告，并歪曲事实，到处控告，同时也给黄绍竑写信，黄绍竑还当她的面表示要为她“喊冤”。她还威胁学校，要开大会赔礼道歉，恢复她的名誉。她声称不达到要求就到处写标语，还要向全世界人民呼吁。整风开始初期，谢昕又借这个机会向党猖狂进攻，贴出“血泪控诉”大字报，要求还她名誉，并在自由论坛大会上再次作了“血泪控诉”，企图争取广大学生的同情。当大家以事实反驳了她假造的控诉以后，谢又贴出第二张“血泪控诉”大字报，说旧的血泪未干，学校又在制造新的阴谋。谢自知学校没有她造谣诬蔑的市场，还在帝国主义国家记者的面前献媚，同样以歪曲事实，造谣污蔑的言论，来诽谤我们的新社会。
    在今天的大会上，六千余师生员工，听到反革命分子谢昕的罪行，以及利用党的整风运动进行猖狂进攻的事实后，群情激怒。在会上十七名师生员工代表愤怒指斥谢昕为屡教不改的反革命分子，是大学生的败类。因时间关系，没有在会上发言，递到主席台上的纸条就有一百多张。他们一致要求党本着“有反必肃，有错必纠”的原则，对屡教不改的反革命分子要严加惩罚，不允许漏掉一个反革命分子，要求学校开除她的学籍，并要求检察机关重新处理她的案件。最后全体大会还一致推选十九位师生员工代表，携带大会致全国人民代表大会主席团的信，控诉黄绍竑支持包庇反革命分子谢昕。
