    The Secrets in Huang Shaohong's Briefcase

    I heard that rightist Huang Shaohong's briefcase contained secret materials. He used these materials to launch many overt and covert attacks against the People's Government and the Communist Party, and he also used these materials to equip rightists like Lin Xiling and Xie Xinyi. What kind of secret materials were hidden in Huang Shaohong's briefcase? Although this is still a matter shrouded in mystery, it is not entirely impossible to explore.

    At the end of last year, Huang Shaohong came to Guangdong to inspect political and legal work. For eight days, he went to the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorates, courts, and judicial organs, held symposiums with lawyers and people's assessors, visited labor reform factories, detention centers, public security exhibitions, and court sessions, interrogated four prisoners, and reviewed a batch of case files. Throughout this series of activities, Huang Shaohong fully exposed his ulterior motives and intentions for the inspection.

    Huang Shaohong's inspection of political and legal work was not aimed at improving and enhancing this work, but at finding fault with the People's Government and the Communist Party, and at seeking materials to "redress grievances" for counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, he adopted an extremely distrustful attitude towards the units he inspected, using various methods, even unscrupulous means, to seize what he considered useful information. Huang Shaohong was "very interested" in public security work and wanted to inspect it; however, the Public Security Bureau invited him to listen to reports three times, but he refused to go, and instead sought to extract information about the shortcomings and errors of public security work from the people he came into contact with. When he visited the Guangzhou No. 1 Detention Center, he sat down and only asked two questions: "Do the prisoners eat enough?" "Is there any phenomenon of beating and scolding prisoners?" He immediately went down to the prison cells to visit the prisoners. He talked directly with the prisoners and asked questions in three prison cells without finding any problems, so he interrogated four more prisoners. When interrogating Kuomintang secret agent Zhuang Xuan, he said to this agent: "I am also a member of the Kuomintang. If you have any ideological problems, you can tell me what you see as bad about the Communist Party in the mainland." See how arrogant Huang Shaohong has become!

    During his inspection, Huang Shaohong showed sympathy and concern for counter-revolutionaries everywhere, feeling everything as if it were his own. If any "injustice" was discovered, he would stand up and "redress their grievances" and "cry injustice" for them. In the detention center, he saw that there were more theoretical books than literary works in the library, so he immediately said to the staff: "More old literary books such as 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' and 'Water Margin' should be purchased, as these also have educational significance. Theoretical books are boring and tasteless, and prisoners will not like to read them." It is truly unknown whether this is Huang Shaohong's own view or the prisoners' true thoughts, but I think there is likely to be a common ground. In labor reform units, some departments, due to an excessive emphasis on humanitarian treatment, have raised the supply standards for prisoners too high, causing dissatisfaction among the nearby masses, who have made many complaints to the public security departments. After learning about this situation, Huang Shaohong did not suggest that the relevant units change this unreasonable phenomenon, but instead emphasized that the staff should persuade the masses.

    When Huang Shaohong visited the detention center, he talked with those Chiang gang secret agents who had smuggled explosives, time bombs, and incendiary devices from Hong Kong, preparing to launch a riot in Guangzhou on October 10, 1956, expressing great concern for these people.

    If Huang Shaohong truly cared about the safety of the people's lives and property, he should recognize the serious significance of punishing counter-revolutionaries and all criminals. However, Huang Shaohong, immediately after visiting the detention center, said to the staff of the Guangdong Provincial Procuratorate: "I think general supervision work is more important than prosecution work. Because the cases prosecuted do not necessarily involve great crimes and harm, but violations of law and discipline by cadres often cause great losses. The bad consequences caused by coercion and command are also great; this is a surface rather than a point." The implication is that some violations of law and discipline by cadres are more harmful than counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, so supervising cadres is more important than punishing counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. To further probe Huang Shaohong's deep-seated opinions, wouldn't that be to shift the spearhead of the dictatorship from the heads of the enemies to those revolutionary workers who have shortcomings and errors? If Huang Shaohong's ideal were realized one day, the interests of socialism, the Communist Party, and the broad masses of the people would be reduced to nothing. Huang Shaohong thinks so beautifully, but this is just a naive fantasy of rightists like him.

    During his inspection, Huang Shaohong paid great attention to the shortcomings and errors in the work, while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the great achievements in the work. He listened to reports, looked at summaries, and repeatedly scrutinized errors and shortcomings, tracing them to the end. This is of course allowed and is also strongly supported by the relevant units. But he rarely asked about the achievements, or even ignored them. When he visited the "Guangdong Provincial Public Security Exhibition," which showcased the achievements of political and legal work, he just glanced over it and smiled when asked for his opinion. This is hardly like a people's representative who came specifically to inspect political and legal work! However, these situations are entirely consistent with Huang Shaohong's personal stance and views, and are not surprising. No wonder he made wild remarks at the symposium of responsible persons of various democratic parties invited by the Central United Front Work Department, saying that the statement "achievements are the main thing, deviations and errors are individual" is "propagating achievements, covering up errors, and ignoring errors." In Huang Shaohong's eyes, the liberation of the Chinese people is an error, and the realization of the people's democratic dictatorship is even more of an error. Since Huang Shaohong and the people of the whole country stand on two completely different angles to look at achievements and errors, of course, they will get different results.

    I still need to explain here: I am a cadre in the political and legal system, and I often go to provincial and municipal political and legal organs, so I have the opportunity to hear opinions from various aspects about Huang Shaohong. These opinions are obviously useful for exploring the secret materials in Huang Shaohong's briefcase.

### 黄绍竑公事皮包里的秘密

    黄绍竑公事皮包里的秘密
    听说右派分子黄绍竑的公事皮包里藏有秘密资料，他曾经利用这些资料向人民政府和共产党施放过不少的明枪暗箭，而且还利用这些资料来装备过像林希翎、谢昕一类的右派分子。黄绍竑的公事皮包内到底藏了些什么秘密资料呢？虽然这还是一个讳莫如深的问题，但也不是完全不可能探索的。
    去年年底，黄绍竑到广东来视察政法工作，前后八天，他到了广东省和广州市的检察院、法院和司法机关，召开了律师座谈会和陪审员座谈会，参观了劳改工厂、看守所、公安展览会和法庭开庭情况，提审了四个犯人，调阅了一批案卷。黄绍竑在这一系列的活动中，充分暴露了他不可告人的视察目的和动机。
    黄绍竑视察政法工作，不是为了改进和提高这一工作，而是为了找人民政府和共产党的岔子，为了替反革命分子找“鸣冤”的材料而来的。因此，他对那些被视察的单位采取了极不信任的态度，采取各种方法，甚至不择手段地攫取他认为有用的资料。黄绍竑对公安工作“很感兴趣”，要视察公安工作；但是公安厅三次请他去听汇报，他却不去，而且从所接触的人员中多方探取有关公安工作的缺点和错误。他到广州市第一看守所参观时，坐下只问了两句：“犯人吃得饱不饱？”“有没有打骂犯人现象？”立即下到监仓去访问犯人。他与犯人直接谈话，问遍了三个监仓没发现问题，便又提审了四个犯人。在提审国民党特务分子庄玄时，他对这个特务说：“我也是国民党的人，你有甚么思想搞不通的，你看了大陆各方面，共产党有甚么不好的，都可以对我讲。”请看，黄绍竑已狂妄到何种地步！
    黄绍竑在视察中对于反革命分子处处寄予同情和关怀，对他们的一切如同身受，稍有“不平”之处被发现，他便要挺身而出为他们“鸣冤”“叫屈”。他在看守所中看见图书室理论书籍多于文艺作品，便立即对工作人员说：“应该多购置一些三国志、水浒传等旧文艺书籍，这也有教育意义的，理论书籍枯燥无味，犯人不会爱看的。”这真不知到底是黄绍竑自己的看法，还是犯人真正的思想，我想这很可能有共通之点。在劳改单位中，有些部门因过份强调人道主义待遇，将犯人供给标准提得太高，引起附近群众的不满，向公安部门提了不少意见。黄绍竑了解到这种情况后，不是建议有关单位改变这种不合理的现象，而是强调工作人员要去说服群众。
    黄绍竑在参观看守所时，曾经同那些从香港偷运炸药、定时炸弹、纵火器等，准备于1956年10月10日在广州发动暴乱的蒋帮特务分子谈过话，表示对这些人很关心。
    黄绍竑如果真正关怀人民生命财产的安全，应该认识到惩办反革命和一切罪犯的严重意义。但是，黄绍竑刚刚参观了看守所，就在广东省检察院对工作人员说：“我认为一般监督工作比起诉工作还重要。因起诉的案子罪恶危害不一定都很大，但干部违法乱纪常常造成很大的损失。强迫命令所造成的恶果也是很大的，这是面而不是点。”言外之意，是干部的某些违法乱纪现象比反革命分子和其他犯罪分子的危害还要大，所以监督干部比惩办反革命和其他犯罪分子更为重要。更进一步试探黄绍竑内心深处的意见，那岂不是要将专政的锋芒从敌人的头子转移到革命工作人员中有缺点和错误的人的头上？黄绍竑的理想如果一朝实现，社会主义、共产党和广大人民的利益便归于乌有了。黄绍竑想得真美，只不过这是他这类右派分子过于天真的幻想罢了。
    黄绍竑在视察中对工作中的缺点和错误非常重视，而对工作中巨大的成绩却视而不见、听而不闻。他听汇报、看总结，对错误和缺点要反复推敲，追查到底。这当然是允许的，而且也受到各有关单位大力支持。但他对成绩部分却很少过问，甚至不闻不问。他参观展览政法工作成绩的“广东省公安展览会”时，竟一溜而过，请他提意见，他只笑笑。这那像一个专为视察政法工作而来的人民代表呢！不过这些情况，与黄绍竑个人的立场、观点是完全一致，不足为奇的。无怪乎他在中央统战部邀请的各民主党派负责人座谈会上大放厥词，说“成绩是主要的、偏差错误是个别的”这种说法，是“宣扬成绩，掩护错误，忽视错误”。在黄绍竑眼中，中国人民获得解放就是错误，实现人民民主专政更是错误。黄绍竑和全国人民对成绩和错误既然是站在两个这样完全不同的角度去看的，当然就会得到不同的结果。
    信写到这里，还需要说明一下：我是政法系统的干部，经常跑省市政法机关，所以有机会听到各方面对黄绍竑的一些意见。这些意见对探索黄绍竑的公事皮包里的秘密资料显然有些用处。
