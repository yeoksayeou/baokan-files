The Intention of the Negotiations is Not Disarmament
Zhang Zhenya

Before the U.S. disarmament negotiation representative, Stassen, could utter all his far-fetched "disarmament proposals," Reston, a "New York Times" reporter familiar with Washington's inside story, revealed the U.S. government's true position on the London disarmament conference. On June 30, he wrote in the "New York Times": "Even if the Soviet representative accepts all the proposals made by Stassen in London regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, aerial inspection of Soviet and American territories, and the reduction of armaments, it is still doubtful whether the (U.S.) government is willing to sign a treaty."

In past disarmament group meetings, a consistent pattern of action displayed by U.S. representatives has been: whenever Soviet representatives take a step forward in the negotiations, U.S. representatives retreat a step from their original position. Judging from the actions of U.S. representatives at the recent London conference, the old drama is clearly being replayed. When the Soviet representatives further accepted the U.S. representatives' proposal for aerial inspection and proposed a two- to three-year cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the U.S. representatives stated that they were only willing to temporarily halt nuclear weapons testing for ten months and threatened in ultimatum-like terms that if the U.S. proposal was not accepted, no agreement would be reached.

According to Reston, it seems that the closer the U.S. government gets to needing to make a decision, the more hesitant it becomes. In fact, Washington has intentionally adopted a delaying tactic in the disarmament negotiations. The reason for adopting the delaying tactic is that the pressure from people around the world demanding disarmament and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing has forced the U.S. government to sit down and negotiate, but on the other hand, Washington is extremely unwilling to reach a disarmament agreement because this is incompatible with the U.S. government's current fundamental policies.

Disarmament, especially the prohibition of nuclear weapons, is first and foremost contrary to the Eisenhower administration's so-called "New Look" military policy. The main content of this policy is to base the U.S. military strategy primarily on the "deterrent power" of nuclear weapons. For this consideration, the U.S. government's 1958 fiscal budget nearly doubled the expenditure on the development of missiles (from $1.2 billion per year in the past few years to $2.2 billion). The development of nuclear weapons is given the highest priority in the U.S. military plan. This is why, as soon as Soviet representative Zorin proposed a cessation of nuclear weapons testing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Strauss, and Secretary of State Dulles unanimously shouted: the United States can never accept this proposal. Strauss even openly clamored: the United States must continue to "develop, test, produce, and stockpile this (atomic) weapon." After the U.S. President recently announced that the United States needs to continue nuclear testing, people are even more certain that the U.S. government has no intention of ending the nuclear arms race and abandoning nuclear weapons.

The attitude adopted by the U.S. government on the disarmament issue is also directly related to the interests of the U.S. monopoly capitalist groups. Disarmament is a threat to the U.S. militarized economy, which relies heavily on military spending as an important pillar. It is no longer a secret that many important U.S. companies have made fortunes from military orders. Examples of this are readily available. For example, the aircraft manufacturing industry, which has developed into one of the largest industrial sectors in the United States in recent years due to massive military orders, now mainly relies on government military orders to maintain its high level of business activity. Other important companies are also closely related to the Department of Defense's spending. It is precisely because of this that the U.S. economy is extremely sensitive to the development of the disarmament issue. United Press International reported: "News of a possible agreement on the disarmament issue has triggered a downward trend in the U.S. economy," revealing the unease of some U.S. companies that have made huge profits from the arms race about the prospect of disarmament. It is no wonder that the U.S. government is, as Reston said, "hesitant."

There is also an important diplomatic concern behind the U.S. government's unwillingness to reach a disarmament agreement. Since the war, the United States has been tightly binding its "allies" to the U.S. chariot through means such as intensifying the international Cold War situation, concluding military alliances, and signing agreements. The relaxation of the international situation that would inevitably result from reaching a disarmament agreement would undermine this situation, increase the centrifugal force of its "allies," and weaken the United States' control over the capitalist world. This is something the U.S. ruling class is extremely unwilling to see. During the London disarmament conference, Washington repeatedly assured the member states of its military blocs that the Western countries' disarmament plans would never include abandoning the nuclear weapons "deterrent" in future global warfare. This was out of this concern, with the aim of tightening the reins and preventing any relaxation of the Cold War.

The British weekly "New Statesman and Nation" commented on the recent disarmament negotiations: "The optimistic atmosphere created by the Geneva summit meeting in the past two years has not been confirmed... The root cause of all this disappointment is that Washington is simply unwilling to dismantle its Cold War fortress. It has spent a lot of money and effort to build this fortress, and it still has so many vested interests to rely on to maintain it." This can be said to be right on the mark.

However, regarding the attitude of the U.S. ruling class towards the disarmament negotiations, it is best to quote the words of the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital - "Time" magazine. Recently, this magazine said bluntly: "The theme of the London negotiations, strictly speaking, is not disarmament, but to further formulate the rules of the duel!" So that's it. The true intention of the endless "proposals" made by the U.S. negotiators at the London disarmament negotiation table is actually here.

    谈判之意不在裁军
    张振亚
    在美国裁军谈判代表史塔生还没有吐出他的横生枝节的全部“裁军建议”之前，熟悉华盛顿内幕的“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿就道出了美国政府对伦敦裁军会议的真实立场。6月30日他在“纽约时报”上写道：“即使苏联代表接受了史塔生在伦敦对他们提出的关于停止核武器试验、对苏联和美国的领土进行空中视察和裁减军备的全部建议，（美国）政府是否愿意签订一项条约仍然是个疑问。”
    在历届裁军小组会议上，美国代表一向表现的一个行动规律是：每当苏联代表在谈判中前进一步，美国代表就要从原来的立场上后退一步。从最近伦敦会议上美国代表的行动看来，老戏显然又在上演了。当苏联代表进一步接受了美国代表提出的天空视察的主张并提出停止核武器试验两年到三年的建议的时候，美国代表表示只愿意暂时停止核武器试验十个月，并用最后通牒的口气扬言，不接受美国这个主意就什么协议也达不成。
    照赖斯顿的说法，好像美国政府越临近需要作出决定的时候，越犹豫不决。其实，华盛顿在裁军谈判上一直是有意采取一种拖延的策略的。其所以采取拖延的办法，是因为全世界人民要求裁军和停止核武器试验的压力使美国政府不得不坐下来谈判，但另一方面华盛顿又极不愿意达成裁军协议，因为这件事同美国政府的现行基本政策是不相容的。
    裁军，特别是禁止核武器，首先同艾森豪威尔政府的所谓“新新面貌”的军事方针相违背。这个方针的主要内容就是把美国的军事战略主要建立在核武器的“威慑力量”上。为了这种考虑，美国政府1958年度财政预算把发展导弹的费用增加了几乎一倍。（由过去几年的每年十二亿美元增加到二十二亿美元）核武器的发展在美国军备计划中被列于最优先的地位。这就是为什么苏联代表佐林刚刚提出停止核武器试验的建议，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福、原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯和国务卿杜勒斯就一致大叫：美国绝不可能接受这个建议。斯特劳斯更公开叫嚷：美国必须继续“发展、试验、生产和储存这种（原子）武器。”在美国总统最近宣布美国需要继续核试验之后，人们对于美国政府的无意终止核武器竞赛和放弃核武器，就更确定无疑了。
    美国政府在裁军问题上所采取的态度也是同美国垄断资本集团的利益直接相关的。裁军对于迄今以军事开支为其重要支柱的美国军事化经济是一项威胁。美国许多重要企业是依靠军事订货发财，早已不是秘密了。这方面的例子俯拾即是。例如，战后几年来已因庞大的军事订货而发展成为美国最大工业部门之一的飞机制造业现在就是主要依靠政府的军事订货来维持它高度的企业活动水平的。其他一些重要企业，也同国防部的开支密切相关。正是因为如此，所以美国的经济对于裁军问题的发展极为敏感。合众社在报道中说：“可能达成裁军问题协议的消息已引起了美国经济走下坡路的趋势。”就是透露了靠军备竞赛大赚其钱的一些美国企业对于裁军前景感到不安。这就难怪美国政府要像赖斯顿所说的“犹豫不决”了。
    美国政府不愿达成裁军协议还有一个重要的外交顾虑。战后美国一直通过加剧国际冷战局势、缔结军事联盟和协定的手段把它的“盟国”紧紧束缚在美国的战车上。达成裁军协议所势必引起的国际局势的缓和，会破坏这种情况，加大它的“盟国”的离心力，削弱美国在资本主义世界的控制地位。这是美国统治集团所极不愿意看到的。在伦敦裁军会议进行时期，华盛顿一再向它的军事集团成员国家保证，西方国家的裁军计划决不包含在未来的全球战争中放弃核武器的“威慑”力量，就是出于这种顾虑，目的在收紧缰绳，不使冷战有所松弛。
    英国“新政治家与民族”周刊在评论最近的裁军谈判时，作了这样的评述：“在过去两年中，日内瓦最高级会议所引起的乐观气氛并未获得证实……造成这一切失望的根源是华盛顿根本不愿意拆毁它的冷战堡垒。为建造这个堡垒，它曾花了大量的钱和心血，它还有这样多的既得利益要依靠保存这个堡垒来维持。”这可以说是一语中的了。
    不过关于美国统治集团对裁军谈判的态度，最好还是引用美国垄断资本的喉舌——“时代”周刊的话。最近这家杂志赤裸裸地说：“伦敦谈判的主题，严格说来并不是裁军，而是在进一步制定决斗的规则！”原来如此。美国谈判代表在伦敦裁军谈判桌上提不尽的“建议”，其真实意图竟在这里了。
